00:00.338 --> 00:02.455
<i>Previouly on Penny Dreadful...</i>

00:02.516 --> 00:03.989
Splendid day, isn't it?

00:04.006 --> 00:05.719
Sir Malcolm? Is everything all right?

00:05.839 --> 00:06.813
What do you mean?

00:06.933 --> 00:08.131
He's a changed man.

00:08.131 --> 00:10.888
<i>Since he became reaquainted
with you, Ms. Poole.</i>

00:10.927 --> 00:12.294
Scream for me.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.411
<i>You're in danger.</i>

00:13.427 --> 00:14.488
<i>That big book,</i>

00:14.510 --> 00:15.886
<i>with the glyph on the side?</i>

00:15.917 --> 00:17.585
If ever the day comes

00:17.605 --> 00:20.498
when my Little Scorpion
is crushed and beaten,

00:20.526 --> 00:22.217
<i>only then does she open it.</i>

00:22.270 --> 00:26.105
<i>On that day, she will have
gone away from God forever.</i>

00:26.141 --> 00:29.225
This is my cousin, Miss Lily Frankenstein.

00:29.277 --> 00:31.361
Do you think it bold if
I compliment your eyes?

00:31.396 --> 00:32.445
Yes.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.147
[Vanessa] <i>Be still your heart, Doctor.</i>

00:34.199 --> 00:36.249
Mr. Gray is being a
proper host to a new guest.

00:36.284 --> 00:37.684
You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.

00:37.719 --> 00:39.585
[Ethan] <i> I believe we make
ourselves who we are.</i>

00:40.055 --> 00:41.688
<i>The blood's on our hands, not God's.</i>

00:42.023 --> 00:43.523
Whatever you have made yourself,

00:43.558 --> 00:45.024
I'm here to accept you.

00:45.060 --> 00:46.426
We're together for a reason.

[grunting]

00:47.963 --> 00:49.495
[snarling]

00:51.199 --> 00:52.966
Will you let me escort you home?

[Sembene] Things become other things.

01:31.039 --> 01:33.606
The leopard consumes the monkey

01:35.143 --> 01:38.978
and becomes leopard and monkey.

01:41.516 --> 01:45.718
The crocodile consumes the leopard

01:47.389 --> 01:51.157
and becomes crocodile and leopard...

01:52.460 --> 01:53.693
and monkey.

01:54.763 --> 01:56.262
I have seen this.

01:59.501 --> 02:04.037
The shamans in my mountains
call it Uchawi Mabadiliko...

02:06.141 --> 02:08.875
the changing from one skin into another.

02:11.012 --> 02:14.447
The ones so cursed do not
always fully remember it,

02:15.750 --> 02:19.335
this... becoming.

02:23.258 --> 02:25.258
Is it a sickness...

02:27.062 --> 02:28.795
or is it something else?

02:29.531 --> 02:32.181
Is it a blessing,

02:32.233 --> 02:34.734
the purpose of which we cannot yet see?

02:35.437 --> 02:38.104
I say this is what it is.

02:39.357 --> 02:42.692
For I know you, my friend, Ethan Chandler.

02:42.744 --> 02:44.777
I see inside you,

02:46.448 --> 02:49.916
past the crocodile... and the leopard...

02:50.785 --> 02:52.085
and the monkey.

02:54.589 --> 02:55.922
And the wolf.

[breathing shakily]

[inhales sharply]

03:09.304 --> 03:10.903
Tell me what you saw.

03:11.406 --> 03:13.356
<i>♪</i>

04:45.533 --> 04:47.867
[Vanessa] <i> No, Sir Malcolm,
that's not it at all.</i>

04:47.902 --> 04:49.869
It wasn't female hysteria.

04:50.572 --> 04:52.572
- Don't insult me.
- Then what was it?

04:52.657 --> 04:54.240
She was in danger, and she sensed it.

04:54.292 --> 04:57.076
I was on my way to say
good night to the doctor

04:57.128 --> 04:58.744
and I felt I was being surrounded.

04:58.746 --> 04:59.912
I couldn't breathe.

04:59.964 --> 05:01.881
[Sir Malcolm] And who was surrounding you?

05:01.916 --> 05:03.132
I don't know.

05:03.885 --> 05:06.385
I find this difficult to credit, I'm sorry.

05:06.421 --> 05:07.587
Hold on.

05:07.589 --> 05:10.306
You don't credit Miss Ives'
ability to sense things?

05:10.341 --> 05:11.924
I think it more likely the room was crowded

05:11.976 --> 05:13.676
and she became overstimulated.

05:13.728 --> 05:14.927
[Frankenstein sighs]

05:15.763 --> 05:17.196
We have been living under a certain amount

05:17.232 --> 05:18.297
of pressure here, Doctor,

05:18.333 --> 05:20.933
as the mountains of
armaments might suggest.

05:20.969 --> 05:21.968
And now?

05:23.938 --> 05:25.037
I need to go.

05:25.907 --> 05:28.357
- What?
- I need to leave.

05:28.409 --> 05:30.610
- London isn't safe.
- I'll go with you.

05:32.247 --> 05:34.780
- I'm not sure.
- I'm coming with you.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.250
I think that's a wise precaution.

05:38.536 --> 05:41.420
Both of you go somewhere
far away and stay there.

05:41.456 --> 05:43.039
She's safer here.

05:43.091 --> 05:45.341
I won't be kept a prisoner
in this house, Sir Malcolm.

05:45.376 --> 05:47.843
If I'm to be pent up,
I'll choose my own cell.

05:47.879 --> 05:49.695
Don't tell us where you're going.

05:52.667 --> 05:53.633
Just go.

05:54.769 --> 05:58.521
- This company is safe.
- [Frankenstein] Is it though?

05:58.556 --> 06:00.890
Are any of us immune to
this danger we can't see,

06:00.942 --> 06:03.309
can't touch, but is everlastingly present?

06:04.979 --> 06:07.346
Mr. Lyle's right. Tell no one.

06:08.283 --> 06:10.650
And we're not to even
trust one another, then?

06:12.987 --> 06:14.320
Has it come to this?

06:17.208 --> 06:19.258
Then why trust Mr. Chandler to go with you?

06:19.294 --> 06:20.793
[Vanessa] Because he wasn't there.

06:21.963 --> 06:23.462
You were all in the room with me.

06:23.498 --> 06:25.264
And yet the lions still hunted.

06:26.501 --> 06:28.000
[Ethan] We'll leave immediately.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.052
Yes.

06:37.278 --> 06:39.912
Doctor, may I have a word?

06:45.269 --> 06:48.187
I want to tell you
alone where I plan to go.

06:49.190 --> 06:50.773
Are you sure that's a good idea?

06:50.825 --> 06:52.908
Someone has to know. I trust you.

06:52.944 --> 06:55.244
What are you up to, Vanessa?

06:55.279 --> 06:58.080
I've never met a woman
less likely to run and hide.

06:59.584 --> 07:02.201
So far we've been thrashing at specters.

07:02.253 --> 07:04.170
I'm going to find a better weapon.

07:07.592 --> 07:10.376
While I'm gone, do be
mindful of Sir Malcolm.

07:10.378 --> 07:13.262
He's losing his heart and needs our care.

07:13.297 --> 07:14.547
I shall.

07:17.051 --> 07:20.886
And if he needs me, don't hesitate, come.

07:24.058 --> 07:25.641
And be patient with your cousin.

07:25.693 --> 07:27.893
It's all so new to her.

07:27.945 --> 07:30.780
London and all the bright
shiny prizes it offers.

07:30.815 --> 07:32.365
She'll grow tired of them.

07:33.117 --> 07:34.367
That's very kind.

07:36.237 --> 07:37.370
Only what if she doesn't?

07:38.473 --> 07:40.906
Then we'll have a long
talk on a dark night.

07:42.577 --> 07:43.909
[Frankenstein sighs]

08:10.688 --> 08:12.438
That's where it happened?

08:13.775 --> 08:14.824
Yes.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.810
[both sigh]

08:55.399 --> 08:57.032
Where should I go?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.537
I slept down here. There's a bed upstairs.

09:02.657 --> 09:05.958
Why don't you take that?
This is your house now.

09:07.712 --> 09:09.161
We'll have to replenish the stores.

09:10.164 --> 09:12.131
I know the forest. It'll supply us.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.050
And Sembene sent along some tins as well,

09:15.086 --> 09:17.136
so we won't starve, anyway.

09:17.171 --> 09:18.387
[inhales sharply]

09:22.176 --> 09:24.093
Do you believe a place can be haunted?

09:26.097 --> 09:27.763
Yes.

09:27.815 --> 09:30.015
Have you been in such a place?

09:34.489 --> 09:36.188
Indian graveyard in Arizona.

09:37.742 --> 09:38.791
Indians I killed.

09:41.829 --> 09:43.429
Were you frightened?

09:45.099 --> 09:46.699
I felt I belonged there.

09:50.605 --> 09:52.505
Perhaps I belong here.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.608
She always thought that.

10:02.717 --> 10:04.934
I don't know that I'm made for company.

10:05.803 --> 10:07.603
I think I'm made for something...

10:08.356 --> 10:09.688
like the moors.

10:15.146 --> 10:17.897
And for doing such things
as hurt even as they help.

10:22.286 --> 10:24.320
She called me her Little Scorpion,

10:26.824 --> 10:29.041
and only said my name aloud once,

10:30.578 --> 10:32.177
before she was murdered,

10:33.814 --> 10:35.497
tied to that tree outside.

10:38.286 --> 10:40.419
I've never liked trees since.

10:42.390 --> 10:43.672
Not one.

10:47.979 --> 10:49.895
Thank you, I will go upstairs.

11:38.913 --> 11:40.379
[Vanessa] For years now, Sir Malcolm and I

11:40.414 --> 11:42.381
have had a very private relationship.

11:43.985 --> 11:46.485
In a way, I think I savored that.

11:47.488 --> 11:48.871
The intensity of it.

11:49.824 --> 11:51.323
Perhaps I even fed on it.

11:53.628 --> 11:55.828
And Mrs. Poole threatens that?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.162
Doesn't she?

11:58.049 --> 11:59.465
He's lost his anger.

12:01.002 --> 12:03.886
That resentment and rage is what we shared.

12:04.839 --> 12:06.839
Our bond was in our mutual suffering.

12:08.976 --> 12:10.342
Despite all that,

12:10.394 --> 12:13.679
you're still the closest thing
to a family he's got left.

12:13.681 --> 12:16.181
He didn't go to his own wife's funeral.

12:16.233 --> 12:19.652
Doesn't that demonstrate
his allegiance to his family?

12:21.072 --> 12:23.072
Because it was too painful, maybe.

12:24.525 --> 12:25.824
You know better.

12:27.078 --> 12:28.527
He's in love.

12:29.914 --> 12:31.914
The memories of his past, including me,

12:31.949 --> 12:33.999
are clouds he doesn't want to face.

12:35.503 --> 12:37.252
And why should I demand him to?

12:38.172 --> 12:41.206
Just so I can retain
my unique bond with him?

12:42.543 --> 12:43.842
It's selfish.

12:45.046 --> 12:47.179
My God, let him be happy.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.636
[gasps] Wood betony,

12:55.473 --> 12:57.439
attracts bees for honey.

12:58.109 --> 12:59.942
Crushed and put into your pillow,

12:59.977 --> 13:01.560
it prevents nightmares.

13:01.562 --> 13:03.862
- Ooh, get a lot of that.
- [laughs]

13:07.618 --> 13:09.284
When I was with Miss Croft,

13:10.705 --> 13:14.239
I was more content than
I ever thought I could be.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.460
For once in my life, I
didn't feel like running away.

13:19.630 --> 13:21.497
I felt I had a place to belong.

13:22.383 --> 13:24.416
She was your moors.

13:25.336 --> 13:26.802
Your solitude.

13:26.837 --> 13:28.087
In a way.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.591
Sir Malcolm's just looking
for where he belongs now.

13:33.677 --> 13:35.010
Without Mina.

13:35.679 --> 13:37.062
Without you, even.

13:38.232 --> 13:39.932
But when he settles
down, he'll come around.

13:39.984 --> 13:41.600
He won't forget about you.

13:42.903 --> 13:44.603
I certainly didn't.

13:57.368 --> 13:58.450
[grunts softly]

13:58.486 --> 13:59.835
Are you making a rabbit snare?

13:59.870 --> 14:00.886
Surprised?

14:02.173 --> 14:04.289
Who knew you were so handy?

14:05.092 --> 14:08.861
Life isn't all tarot cards and
pagan blood glyphs, you know.

14:10.347 --> 14:12.047
You know what?

14:12.099 --> 14:15.050
You're gonna make someone a
great little wifey one day.

14:15.102 --> 14:16.301
[chuckles]

14:24.879 --> 14:26.345
So... [clears throat]

14:27.181 --> 14:29.581
I'm all of eight or the like

14:30.618 --> 14:33.402
and my father takes sadistic glee...

14:34.738 --> 14:36.155
in pulling me out there,

14:36.157 --> 14:38.457
pointing at the biggest one, and saying,

14:38.492 --> 14:39.992
"Ride, boy!"

14:40.995 --> 14:42.795
Now, all the vaqueros,

14:42.830 --> 14:45.330
those are the Spanish
ranch hands, are watching

14:45.332 --> 14:48.500
and they can't wait to see the little lord,

14:48.502 --> 14:50.502
in his velvet knickers, fall on his ass.

14:50.538 --> 14:51.753
[chuckles]

14:53.891 --> 14:58.010
I walk up to this monstrous big horse,

14:58.062 --> 15:00.813
who goes by the name of,
I kid you not, Diablo.

15:01.382 --> 15:02.848
- Ooh.
- [both chuckle]

15:03.484 --> 15:05.601
And he's snorting fire

15:06.153 --> 15:09.738
and his hooves are pounding the earth.

15:09.773 --> 15:12.024
My little knees are knocking together,

15:12.076 --> 15:13.158
and I just look up at him

15:13.194 --> 15:14.860
and say in my best grown-up voice,

15:15.863 --> 15:18.447
"Know your master, beast."

15:18.532 --> 15:19.698
[chuckles]

15:20.868 --> 15:22.084
What happened?

15:23.003 --> 15:24.753
Broken wrist and soiled knickers.

15:24.788 --> 15:26.338
[both laughing]

15:27.458 --> 15:30.792
That's the most unheroic
story I've ever heard.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.797
You must have been scared of
something when you were young.

15:35.850 --> 15:37.132
No.

15:37.184 --> 15:38.851
- I was fearless.
- Come on.

15:38.886 --> 15:39.968
Really.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.187
Mmm. You don't fool me.

15:46.610 --> 15:47.726
Dolls.

15:50.147 --> 15:51.897
- Dolls?
- Dolls.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.984
Like, girlie dolls?

15:56.036 --> 15:59.037
- Yes, girlie dolls.
- [both chuckle]

15:59.073 --> 16:00.622
- Don't laugh.
- Never.

16:03.627 --> 16:06.245
I mean, I played with them.

16:07.414 --> 16:08.997
You had to, or they
thought you were deviant

16:09.049 --> 16:11.800
in some dreadful way,
but I never liked them.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.387
My mother insisted on
deploying them around my room

16:15.422 --> 16:18.340
like an army of little play friends.

16:18.392 --> 16:20.509
But every night, before I went to sleep,

16:20.561 --> 16:22.511
I ran around my room and knocked them over.

16:22.563 --> 16:23.929
Miss Ives!

16:23.931 --> 16:26.398
Then every morning I
would put them all back.

16:26.467 --> 16:30.102
God, those eyes staring at you,

16:30.154 --> 16:32.738
just waiting to come to life.

16:32.773 --> 16:34.940
Who thinks that's healthy for a child?

16:34.942 --> 16:36.108
I played with toy soldiers.

16:36.110 --> 16:37.943
Also not the best recipe for mental health

16:37.945 --> 16:39.211
when you think about it.

16:40.047 --> 16:42.531
All those things that mark
you when you're young...

16:43.617 --> 16:45.450
that make you what you are.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.173
Never escape them.

17:10.894 --> 17:12.644
They just wait, don't they?

17:13.646 --> 17:14.646
[Vanessa] What?

17:16.116 --> 17:17.648
The monsters inside us.

17:19.153 --> 17:20.452
Monsters?

17:22.823 --> 17:25.490
- What would you call them?
- For me...

17:26.827 --> 17:28.126
demons.

17:29.246 --> 17:31.129
But one word is much like another.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.050
[Ethan] And when they're released?

17:35.085 --> 17:37.502
We're most who we are.

17:39.306 --> 17:40.672
Unrestrained.

17:41.842 --> 17:43.141
Ourselves.

17:47.181 --> 17:48.513
I need to go out.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.783
What? Out where?

17:52.853 --> 17:55.020
- There's nowhere to go.
- [inhales sharply]

17:55.022 --> 17:57.406
Just bolt the door when I'm gone.

17:58.525 --> 18:00.492
Do you know how to shoot?

18:01.028 --> 18:02.077
What?

18:02.112 --> 18:03.495
- No.
- I'll teach you.

18:04.782 --> 18:06.531
When will you be back?

18:06.567 --> 18:08.033
- Morning.
- Ethan...

18:08.085 --> 18:10.302
Just bolt the goddamn door!

18:13.807 --> 18:15.340
[Ethan panting]

18:25.619 --> 18:27.686
[breathing heavily]

18:35.029 --> 18:36.778
[sheep bleating]

18:44.455 --> 18:46.872
- [Ethan snarling]
- [sheep squealing]

18:54.631 --> 18:55.964
[roaring]

19:00.637 --> 19:02.337
[distant thudding]

19:13.934 --> 19:15.984
[thudding continues]

19:33.787 --> 19:35.036
Mr. Chandler.

19:38.592 --> 19:40.675
Would you like some breakfast?

19:41.512 --> 19:43.678
Not hungry. Thanks.

19:44.832 --> 19:46.181
[grunting]

19:49.269 --> 19:50.519
Tell me.

19:56.977 --> 19:58.310
We're alone.

19:58.946 --> 20:00.979
Speak quietly, but tell me.

20:03.984 --> 20:05.367
Tell you what?

20:09.873 --> 20:10.906
[whispers] We can whisper

20:10.958 --> 20:12.624
about those things that hurt us.

20:18.332 --> 20:19.731
You need to learn to protect yourself.

20:22.569 --> 20:23.802
[gunshot]

20:34.264 --> 20:35.614
You haven't done this before?

20:36.233 --> 20:38.583
No. I suppose it just comes naturally.

20:38.619 --> 20:40.735
- Why am I not surprised?
- [chuckles]

20:46.610 --> 20:48.093
No, no. Let me.

20:52.783 --> 20:54.115
It's a different thing when you're firing

20:54.168 --> 20:55.700
at something that's alive.

20:56.370 --> 20:58.036
How do you learn that?

20:58.038 --> 20:59.204
[Ethan] Experience.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.543
Aim at the middle of the
body. Don't get fancy.

21:04.595 --> 21:06.261
Don't aim at the head or limbs.

21:07.514 --> 21:09.014
And here's the real trick,

21:09.049 --> 21:11.266
which seems illogical, I know.

21:13.353 --> 21:15.287
Don't look in your opponent's eyes.

21:16.223 --> 21:18.190
That'll stop you every time.

21:18.225 --> 21:20.025
You think for one minute
about what you're doing,

21:20.060 --> 21:21.126
and you won't do it.

21:22.613 --> 21:24.196
Stop being human.

21:25.282 --> 21:26.815
Become something else.

21:28.235 --> 21:29.367
What?

21:31.738 --> 21:33.738
An animal that has to survive.

21:35.209 --> 21:36.458
A predator.

21:37.044 --> 21:38.043
No emotion.

21:38.829 --> 21:39.995
Survival.

21:44.718 --> 21:45.750
And most important?

21:46.670 --> 21:48.470
Don't look into his eyes.

21:50.924 --> 21:52.390
All right.

21:55.896 --> 21:57.095
Moving target.

21:57.931 --> 22:00.398
I feel I owe you for
this. What can I teach you?

22:00.851 --> 22:02.867
Just about any of the
social graces for a start.

22:03.654 --> 22:06.271
[scoffs] Well, that's a long list.

22:07.157 --> 22:09.824
There's the painstaking
ritual of serving tea,

22:09.860 --> 22:11.326
tedious decorum at balls,

22:11.361 --> 22:13.995
- meaningless social banter...
- Dancing.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.783
- Dancing?
- I never learned dancing.

22:19.453 --> 22:21.453
My father didn't approve of such things.

22:21.488 --> 22:23.121
Well, then I shall be your tutor.

22:23.173 --> 22:24.756
I've had practice recently, in fact.

22:25.759 --> 22:26.758
It's a deal.

22:27.761 --> 22:29.794
Now, I'm going to toss this up very gently.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.963
I want you to follow it through the air

22:32.015 --> 22:34.683
and fire at will. Just
don't shoot me, okay?

22:34.718 --> 22:36.134
I'll do my best.

22:39.690 --> 22:41.189
[laughing]

22:46.313 --> 22:48.613
It's the opposite of homicide.

22:48.649 --> 22:50.699
Always look in your opponent's eyes.

22:52.486 --> 22:54.035
[sighs] And then?

22:56.290 --> 22:57.822
Proceed gently.

22:58.825 --> 23:00.375
Take my waist.

23:11.088 --> 23:12.671
Up here, Mr. Chandler.

23:15.676 --> 23:17.008
And sway.

23:19.563 --> 23:20.845
[Ethan chuckles]

23:22.316 --> 23:26.067
And one, two, three.

23:26.903 --> 23:29.688
One, two, three.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.856
[laughs] One, two, three. That's it.

23:37.948 --> 23:39.864
That's it, Mr. Chandler. Come on.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.701
One, two, three. One, two, three.

23:42.703 --> 23:43.802
One, two, three.

23:51.044 --> 23:53.428
No. Too much salt.

24:48.351 --> 24:49.934
- [thunder rumbling]
- [Vanessa gasps]

25:03.250 --> 25:04.549
I love storms.

25:07.170 --> 25:08.536
Primordial.

25:10.323 --> 25:12.891
Every bit of civilization gone.

25:12.926 --> 25:14.659
Everything true coming out.

25:16.062 --> 25:17.128
Let it.

25:23.103 --> 25:24.102
You don't fear it?

25:26.206 --> 25:27.405
Not now.

25:32.479 --> 25:35.380
This must have been how
the world was created.

25:36.116 --> 25:37.549
Or how it ends.

25:42.456 --> 25:43.571
[glass shattering]

25:47.994 --> 25:49.577
[Ethan] Water!

25:55.752 --> 25:57.168
[grunting]

26:16.389 --> 26:17.956
[wind whooshing]

26:19.576 --> 26:20.575
[Vanessa grunts]

26:33.874 --> 26:35.206
[panting]

27:10.410 --> 27:11.409
No!

27:12.045 --> 27:13.494
[grunts in frustration]

27:14.164 --> 27:15.580
[panting]

27:17.050 --> 27:18.883
We are dangerous.

27:43.777 --> 27:45.243
[panting heavily]

27:50.951 --> 27:52.533
[Frankenstein] <i> What is love</i>

27:52.586 --> 27:55.620
<i>but a kind of creature
waiting to be unbound?</i>

27:57.123 --> 27:58.289
<i>A malady.</i>

28:00.727 --> 28:03.328
What does it bring any of us but...

28:03.363 --> 28:05.163
confusion and bedevilment?

28:07.801 --> 28:10.001
The Egyptians were hardly unique in that.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.270
Yes, but to them it was quite literal.

28:13.807 --> 28:16.007
They called it the "Scorpion's sting,"

28:16.042 --> 28:18.276
a kind of eternal infection

28:19.346 --> 28:22.280
that had no end, not in time or death.

28:23.617 --> 28:25.733
The gods Amunet and Amun-Ra were immortal

28:25.785 --> 28:27.902
and their love was without end as well.

28:28.788 --> 28:29.821
According to the myth,

28:29.823 --> 28:31.155
if they were to become conjoined,

28:31.157 --> 28:33.992
"All light would end and the
world would live in darkness.

28:34.828 --> 28:36.828
The Hidden Ones would emerge and rule."

28:36.880 --> 28:39.797
- Emerge and rule?
- Conquest.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.799
The subjugation of all mankind.

28:43.136 --> 28:44.969
This goes well beyond Miss Ives.

28:46.106 --> 28:48.473
In Biblical terms, it's
the coming of the Beast.

28:48.508 --> 28:50.008
[sighs]

28:50.927 --> 28:53.227
The Hidden Ones who will emerge?

28:54.514 --> 28:57.015
Call them the Fallen
Angels, as our relics do.

28:58.234 --> 29:00.568
Or any such name that pleases you.

29:00.603 --> 29:02.520
Devil, Creature, Demon.

29:03.690 --> 29:04.856
Vampire?

29:06.943 --> 29:08.910
"His name is Legion. For He is many."

29:12.866 --> 29:14.365
Leave the archeology of it behind

29:14.367 --> 29:15.833
for a moment and imagine this.

29:15.869 --> 29:18.369
The Fallen Angel seeks his bride.

29:19.039 --> 29:20.755
He believes this to be Miss Ives,

29:20.790 --> 29:23.508
and she loves him in her way.

29:23.543 --> 29:26.377
They are aligned, these two.

29:26.413 --> 29:28.212
He tries to lure her, seduce her,

29:29.215 --> 29:31.215
attack her if he must.
But he must have her.

29:31.251 --> 29:32.216
Why?

29:33.086 --> 29:36.020
- Why does the Scorpion sting?
- To protect itself.

29:36.056 --> 29:37.989
To kill its enemies.

29:38.024 --> 29:39.991
- And the Demon's enemy?
- God.

29:40.026 --> 29:41.659
And if I don't believe in God?

29:41.695 --> 29:44.095
[scoffs] The Scorpion will still strike,

29:44.130 --> 29:46.397
whether you believe in him or not.

29:46.433 --> 29:47.832
[Frankenstein sighs]

29:53.323 --> 29:54.739
We have to help her.

29:56.326 --> 29:58.626
I'm onto something new here,
something I didn't expect.

29:58.661 --> 30:00.161
I need a few more days.

30:00.213 --> 30:02.046
But I don't think she's
entirely without protection

30:02.082 --> 30:03.414
in the meantime.

30:04.751 --> 30:07.085
One phrase, "The Hound of God."

30:07.137 --> 30:10.421
Like a musical refrain
sounding over and over

30:10.423 --> 30:13.324
in our otherwise
chronological narrative. Why?

30:13.359 --> 30:15.727
A bit of poetry, a flourish. I don't know.

30:15.762 --> 30:18.346
No, no, no. Think how
your mind works, Doctor.

30:18.398 --> 30:19.680
When you can't settle something in peace

30:19.733 --> 30:21.182
you return to it again and again.

30:21.234 --> 30:23.434
- It obsesses you.
- Becomes a neurosis.

30:23.470 --> 30:26.504
Precisely. And it's
repeated neurotically here.

30:26.539 --> 30:29.140
Like the Demon chewing on
a bone it couldn't swallow.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.742
It can't make peace with it.

30:31.778 --> 30:34.112
- It's a danger to him.
- Yes!

30:36.850 --> 30:39.834
Yes, the Demon, the Hound, the Scorpion.

30:41.454 --> 30:43.671
Endlessly circling one another.

30:48.962 --> 30:51.596
You know, Mr. Lyle won't give up.

30:51.631 --> 30:53.681
If there's any sense
to be found in all this,

30:53.716 --> 30:54.932
he'll find it.

30:55.635 --> 30:56.684
And the Doctor, too.

30:56.719 --> 30:58.603
They won't let this thing hurt you.

31:00.140 --> 31:01.305
"This thing."

31:02.475 --> 31:04.025
We need to call it what it is.

31:04.811 --> 31:05.977
The Devil.

31:07.113 --> 31:08.396
[Ethan sighs]

31:09.315 --> 31:10.698
Sometimes...

31:12.652 --> 31:15.153
Sometimes I just want to let it take me.

31:16.122 --> 31:17.405
Put an end to it.

31:19.993 --> 31:21.209
And then?

31:22.996 --> 31:24.879
Then I would know why.

31:26.466 --> 31:28.583
Why this unending torment.

31:34.390 --> 31:36.808
I can't live forever violated.

31:38.144 --> 31:41.345
When I sleep, when I wake, when I pray,

31:41.981 --> 31:43.848
those demons tearing into me.

31:44.901 --> 31:46.767
I once begged you to put
a bullet through my heart,

31:46.820 --> 31:48.820
but you thought it kindness to spare me.

31:48.855 --> 31:50.238
It was cruelty!

31:51.774 --> 31:54.108
You will not die while I'm here.

31:55.028 --> 31:57.361
You will not surrender while I live.

31:59.449 --> 32:04.035
If I have one goddamn purpose
in my cursed life, it's that.

32:06.706 --> 32:08.172
You are one man.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.426
More than that and you know it.

32:18.434 --> 32:20.051
We are not like others.

32:21.721 --> 32:23.554
We have claws for a reason.

32:34.817 --> 32:37.151
Do you ever think what it would be like,

32:37.203 --> 32:38.786
to be like other people?

32:39.739 --> 32:40.988
Normal people?

32:44.961 --> 32:46.711
I try not to.

32:48.464 --> 32:49.513
[dogs barking]

32:55.922 --> 32:57.972
My God, so she's come back.

32:59.309 --> 33:01.509
The little quim with the witch.

33:01.561 --> 33:02.977
And who the fuck are you?

33:03.012 --> 33:04.595
Got herself a man now, does she?

33:05.481 --> 33:06.764
Mind your manners, lad.

33:06.816 --> 33:08.766
Know your betters when they address you.

33:08.818 --> 33:09.834
[dog barking]

33:12.689 --> 33:15.273
One word from me and you
don't have an arm anymore.

33:16.025 --> 33:17.842
They know how to behave.

33:18.778 --> 33:21.112
You know how to get a
dumb animal to behave?

33:21.948 --> 33:23.698
You feed it with your own hand.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.783
You don't let anyone else do it.

33:25.835 --> 33:27.785
You give them food or you don't.

33:27.837 --> 33:30.004
You let some of them
starve so the others see.

33:30.039 --> 33:33.174
So they know their lives
depend entirely on your will.

33:34.794 --> 33:36.711
Learned how to behave yet, little bitch?

33:36.763 --> 33:39.180
- That's enough.
- Not hardly, lad.

33:41.134 --> 33:42.800
Maybe I come visit you, eh?

33:43.803 --> 33:46.187
Bring a match and start another fire.

33:48.274 --> 33:50.207
Young flesh burns best.

33:51.694 --> 33:52.727
Hey!

33:52.779 --> 33:54.812
- [horse whinnying]
- [dogs barking]

34:03.072 --> 34:05.573
I swore one day I would see him again

34:05.658 --> 34:06.874
and be avenged.

34:06.909 --> 34:08.909
You don't need his soul on your conscience.

34:08.962 --> 34:10.494
I can live with that guilt.

34:10.496 --> 34:12.630
No, you can't. That's not who you are.

34:12.665 --> 34:13.831
Of course it is.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.233
Stop looking at me with those eyes

34:16.268 --> 34:17.435
and see me for what I am!

34:17.469 --> 34:19.270
And is that what she
would want? Your friend?

34:19.304 --> 34:21.205
One more step into darkness? For what?

34:21.708 --> 34:23.040
Her memory?

34:23.576 --> 34:24.725
Justice.

34:27.063 --> 34:29.230
What are you gonna do? Kill him?

34:29.264 --> 34:30.614
Sneak up and cut his throat?

34:30.650 --> 34:32.483
Is that what you're going to do?

34:32.518 --> 34:34.402
You do that and you won't be able to stop.

34:34.437 --> 34:35.485
So stop now!

34:35.521 --> 34:37.021
[bangs table]

34:37.023 --> 34:39.322
I'll stop when his soul is burning...

34:39.359 --> 34:40.623
like hers was!

34:40.659 --> 34:43.277
Go on then. Do what you fucking want.

34:43.329 --> 34:45.196
I hope you can live with it,
because I sure as hell can't.

34:47.417 --> 34:48.366
And don't worry...

34:50.753 --> 34:52.585
I see you for exactly what you are.

35:02.782 --> 35:03.931
[sighs]

35:05.551 --> 35:07.935
[Lily] Don't you want me to have friends?

35:08.721 --> 35:10.054
Of course I do.

35:11.107 --> 35:12.156
Do you not like Mr. Gray?

35:14.560 --> 35:16.127
It's not that.

35:17.497 --> 35:18.562
For heaven's sake, Victor,

35:18.564 --> 35:20.398
I can't stay cooped up here all the time.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.237
No, of course not.

35:27.990 --> 35:29.073
You should go.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.659
I'm sure you'll have an amiable time.

35:31.711 --> 35:35.413
And Mr. Gray will certainly
be a charming dinner companion.

35:41.838 --> 35:43.888
Tell me not to go and I won't.

35:45.258 --> 35:46.507
[sighing]

35:51.197 --> 35:52.663
Don't be silly.

35:54.734 --> 35:56.534
I could use some time to work.

35:58.771 --> 36:00.104
You're an awful distraction.

36:02.442 --> 36:03.941
You won't be late?

36:05.445 --> 36:07.495
Don't worry, cousin.

36:07.530 --> 36:09.330
I'll come back with tales for you.

36:23.012 --> 36:25.262
I was surprised to get your invitation.

36:25.298 --> 36:27.431
- I would think you get many.
- No.

36:27.467 --> 36:28.883
I don't go out much.

36:28.935 --> 36:30.634
Your choice or his?

36:32.271 --> 36:33.888
My cousin is...

36:35.024 --> 36:36.690
protective.

36:36.726 --> 36:39.360
I don't think you need much protection.

36:39.395 --> 36:41.479
You are, I believe, more...

36:41.531 --> 36:43.197
capable than you perhaps appear.

36:43.232 --> 36:46.650
I'm useless really. It's all so new to me.

36:46.702 --> 36:47.868
Is it?

36:48.654 --> 36:50.571
My heavens, what's that?

36:50.623 --> 36:54.125
A waxworks. Have you never been to one?

36:54.160 --> 36:56.076
[chuckling] I've never been anywhere.

36:56.129 --> 36:58.662
Then will you allow me to escort you?

37:12.011 --> 37:14.762
- Oh. It's awful!
- It's not real, you know.

37:14.814 --> 37:18.399
Well, I know that, but...
[giggling] But I can't.

37:18.434 --> 37:19.817
I'm such a goose.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.269
You must think me very silly.

37:23.189 --> 37:25.256
I think you're mysterious.

37:27.527 --> 37:29.827
- Hardly that.
- Oh, yes.

37:29.862 --> 37:31.912
The coolness of your touch.

37:33.332 --> 37:36.834
Your sense of... constant discovery.

37:39.005 --> 37:40.538
And your eyes, mostly.

37:41.541 --> 37:44.708
So familiar, but... not.

37:46.512 --> 37:49.713
You make me sound much
more complicated than I am.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.968
Dear! [Laughs] What's this one?

37:55.054 --> 37:58.055
Burke and Hare, the resurrectionist men.

37:58.107 --> 38:00.558
Caught here in the midnight
act of exhuming a body.

38:01.444 --> 38:03.110
Why would they do that?

38:04.030 --> 38:07.198
To sell it to a doctor for
medical experimentation.

38:09.235 --> 38:11.001
What sort of experimentation?

38:12.171 --> 38:13.771
I couldn't say.

38:13.806 --> 38:15.789
[light conversation]

38:31.924 --> 38:34.008
[Dorian] I hope I haven't shocked you.

38:34.060 --> 38:36.260
[Lily] No. It's good to see new things.

38:36.312 --> 38:37.595
[Dorian] Then I hope you'll allow me

38:37.597 --> 38:39.146
to squire you again sometime.

38:39.181 --> 38:42.266
London is nothing if not
filled with new adventures.

38:42.268 --> 38:43.851
Yes, I'd like that.

38:45.104 --> 38:47.304
But I should go now.
Victor will be worried.

38:47.340 --> 38:48.772
Of course.

38:53.012 --> 38:55.246
Lily, thank you for this evening.

38:55.281 --> 38:57.047
You're like a breath of fresh air.

38:58.284 --> 39:00.284
It's good to have a new friend.

39:04.590 --> 39:06.757
And so I hope you'll always count me.

39:09.128 --> 39:11.178
No one's ever done that before.

39:12.048 --> 39:13.597
New adventures.

39:27.647 --> 39:29.563
Number 17, Shad Thames.

42:28.494 --> 42:30.127

42:53.352 --> 42:54.434
Could you stop, please?

42:54.487 --> 42:55.936

43:43.736 --> 43:46.036
Well... hello.

44:24.443 --> 44:26.209
[grunting]

45:55.334 --> 45:56.833
[door closing]

45:57.920 --> 45:58.869
[bolt closing]

46:13.218 --> 46:15.018
You were going to kill him.

46:17.222 --> 46:19.056
I didn't get the chance.

46:21.276 --> 46:22.826
But I guess you know that.

46:25.264 --> 46:27.030
Do you feel better now?

46:28.267 --> 46:30.434
Now that you're a murderess?

46:31.503 --> 46:34.037
I suppose that's what you
learned here, isn't it?

46:34.073 --> 46:35.839
From your nice old lady friend.

46:37.042 --> 46:38.642
How to kill babies.

46:39.812 --> 46:41.378
How to kill men?

46:44.283 --> 46:46.850
- You do belong here.
- I know what I've done.

46:49.221 --> 46:50.721
Do you?

46:50.756 --> 46:52.756
Do you know what it is...

46:52.808 --> 46:55.175
to walk with someone's
body tied around your neck

46:55.227 --> 46:56.810
for the rest of your goddamn life?

46:56.845 --> 46:58.495
Do you know what that is, little girl?

47:00.632 --> 47:03.133
Let me tell you about
it. First time is hard.

47:04.136 --> 47:06.436
I'm sure you cried a bit, didn't you?

47:06.472 --> 47:09.206
Don't worry, that'll pass.
Second time is easier.

47:10.342 --> 47:12.209
Third time, you don't blink.

47:13.479 --> 47:15.412
Then it's all just repetition.

47:16.515 --> 47:17.948
You don't cry anymore.

47:18.917 --> 47:21.818
You don't even remember
when you used to cry.

47:21.854 --> 47:24.454
You're alive and they're dead.

47:24.506 --> 47:26.206
- Fuck 'em.
- Stop it!

47:33.332 --> 47:35.465
You'll never get your soul back.

47:37.402 --> 47:38.602
Not ever.

47:40.472 --> 47:42.372
Do you understand that?

47:45.210 --> 47:46.309
Yes.

47:50.883 --> 47:53.316
Welcome to the night, Vanessa.
