The IT Crowd - 1x02 - Calamity Jen

00:48.601 --> 00:51.692
Has this... ever happened to you?

01:05.376 --> 01:10.129
<i>From today, dialling 999
won't get you the emergency services.</i>

01:10.239 --> 01:12.592
<i>And that's not the only thing
that's changing.</i>

01:13.217 --> 01:15.851
<i>Nicer ambulances,
faster response times,</i>

01:15.865 --> 01:17.505
<i>and better looking drivers</i>

01:17.522 --> 01:19.754
<i>mean they're not just
the emergency services,</i>

01:19.785 --> 01:22.494
<i>they're "your" emergency services. So...</i>

01:22.558 --> 01:24.273
<i>Remember the new number:</i>

01:36.031 --> 01:37.636
<i>That's...</i>

01:48.412 --> 01:52.737
<i>Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble...</i>

01:52.916 --> 01:54.865
Well that's easy to remember!

01:54.961 --> 02:03.616
0118 999 881 999 119 725...

02:03.699 --> 02:04.598
...3!

02:05.369 --> 02:07.490
I don't know why
they just couldn't keep it as it was!

02:07.536 --> 02:09.639
How hard is it to remember 911?

02:09.675 --> 02:11.233
- You mean 999...
- I mean 999!

02:11.260 --> 02:13.127
- That's the American one!
- Yeah!

02:13.198 --> 02:15.941
- You berk!
- Come on, are you ready?

02:16.897 --> 02:18.536
I don't know what to say really
it's fun...

02:18.559 --> 02:20.289
there are some many issues in the world,

02:20.306 --> 02:21.711
They are beautiful, I love them...

02:21.722 --> 02:24.264
in fact they're the most beautiful shoes
I've ever seen but...

02:24.298 --> 02:26.102
you know, I can't have everything
that I love,

02:26.124 --> 02:28.469
otherwise I'd own lots of things,
and actually they're red,

02:28.528 --> 02:31.630
which is quite tarty, and they don't
necessarily go with any of my outfits...

02:31.970 --> 02:33.981
Come on you crazy bitch!

02:34.072 --> 02:34.874
Come on!

02:35.938 --> 02:36.906
Come on!

02:37.068 --> 02:39.251
- Denholm's called the general.
- Oh God, another one!

02:39.269 --> 02:39.840
Yeah!

02:40.270 --> 02:42.616
I bet he declares war on something!

02:43.076 --> 02:45.005
He loves declaring war!

02:46.168 --> 02:47.695
I am declaring...

02:47.781 --> 02:48.853
WAR!

02:52.482 --> 02:54.504
I can see that got your attention.

02:56.862 --> 02:58.547
What am I declaring war on?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.269
My bollocks?!

03:01.414 --> 03:02.883
Stress!

03:04.124 --> 03:07.808
Stress is a disease, people,
and I am a cure!

03:08.210 --> 03:09.852
I'm a doctor with a cure.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.444
No, no! I'm a General!
And it's still a war!

03:12.660 --> 03:14.225
A war on disease!

03:14.226 --> 03:15.303
Stress!

03:16.786 --> 03:18.319
There's too much stress around here.

03:18.527 --> 03:20.436
<i>They're very expensive and besides,</i>

03:20.450 --> 03:23.044
<i>the woman in the shop said
they were way too small for me.</i>

03:23.057 --> 03:25.214
<i>- You see you know, be practical, go on!
- In the time...</i>

03:25.269 --> 03:26.496
I've been speaking,

03:26.497 --> 03:29.671
over 18 million people
have died of stress.

03:34.517 --> 03:35.609
That's another one.

03:36.553 --> 03:37.683
That's another one.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.230
More...

03:40.411 --> 03:41.458
Mayhem!

03:41.829 --> 03:43.044
We gotta deal with it!

03:49.014 --> 03:50.709
- Are you ready to deal with it?!
- Yeah!

03:50.775 --> 03:52.379
Say: "I hate stress!"

03:52.396 --> 03:53.529
- I hate stress!
- No!

03:53.648 --> 03:54.987
You didn't let me finish.

03:55.203 --> 03:56.715
Say: "I hate stress..."

03:56.845 --> 03:59.367
and I want to limitate
its influence in my life,

03:59.561 --> 04:01.656
what can I do about it? Anyone?

04:02.986 --> 04:03.981
Have a bath?

04:05.044 --> 04:06.442
Have a bath?!

04:06.675 --> 04:07.850
Get a bike!

04:08.421 --> 04:10.603
I cycle to work... everyday!

04:10.666 --> 04:11.967
70 miles!

04:12.100 --> 04:14.046
Both here, and here...

04:14.269 --> 04:16.366
are as red as a fire engine!

04:17.349 --> 04:18.440
Any other ideas?

04:20.200 --> 04:21.248
Jen, what about you?

04:21.305 --> 04:22.218
Shoes!

04:22.508 --> 04:24.306
- What?
- Shoes!

04:24.776 --> 04:26.379
Well, shoes...

04:27.487 --> 04:28.719
Ok, look!

04:28.800 --> 04:31.466
I have invited Dr. Julian Holmes

04:31.488 --> 04:33.083
to come and give a class at lunchtime.

04:33.101 --> 04:35.117
He is Europe's leading stress expert.

04:35.284 --> 04:37.391
They call him:" Stressperts!"

04:37.440 --> 04:39.189
Anyone interested in coming along
picking up

04:39.230 --> 04:40.689
a few tips on how to manage stress?

04:43.904 --> 04:45.459
There's a free buffet...

04:49.106 --> 04:49.900
Good!

04:50.320 --> 04:51.680
Good people.

04:51.933 --> 04:53.367
Oh! By the way!

04:53.494 --> 04:55.899
Anyone still experiencing stress
at the end of the day...

04:56.707 --> 04:59.527
will be fired!

05:00.197 --> 05:01.362
It's not going on!

05:01.415 --> 05:03.738
Yeah, I think it is so.
Just down angle it a bit more.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.511
Are you sure you're a 5?

05:05.563 --> 05:07.610
- I'm not a liar.
- Yeah, but I mean I can't...

05:09.174 --> 05:09.839
Just... just...

05:09.924 --> 05:11.948
I  can feel the heel going into the shoe.

05:11.961 --> 05:13.045
Just down angle a bit more...

05:13.062 --> 05:14.489
There is no angle, but I could...

05:14.510 --> 05:15.722
Don't let me push you away!

05:15.736 --> 05:17.438
Just lean in with the shoe. Lean in...

05:17.573 --> 05:18.727
with the shoe!

05:18.820 --> 05:19.524
Lean in!

05:31.413 --> 05:33.405
We've been here... for half an hour.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.276
The shoes aren't going on!

05:35.290 --> 05:37.352
They're two sizes too small.

05:37.485 --> 05:38.980
And even if they did go on,

05:39.096 --> 05:40.271
they would cripple you.

05:40.579 --> 05:42.324
You don't want that, do you?

06:00.161 --> 06:02.726
I myself, have been subject to some...

06:03.064 --> 06:06.169
terrible rages, but... Yes?

06:06.608 --> 06:09.978
- I'm sorry. Is this the stress class?
- Oh yeah. Come on in.

06:10.241 --> 06:11.222
Thank you.

06:12.728 --> 06:14.161
Moss!

06:14.533 --> 06:18.988
This is in here! Moss!

06:23.593 --> 06:25.435
Just come in.

06:55.271 --> 06:56.418
Thank you.

07:11.774 --> 07:12.316
Ok.

07:15.450 --> 07:16.401
Are  you all right?

07:18.893 --> 07:20.621
As I was saying...

07:20.811 --> 07:23.490
I myself have been subject
to some terrible rages.

07:23.768 --> 07:25.067
Where I've...

07:25.164 --> 07:27.621
snapped at my wife, or spoken harshly

07:27.869 --> 07:30.192
to a work colleague, because of stress.

07:30.330 --> 07:34.305
If I... just... thinking about it now,
I realise I'm...

07:34.388 --> 07:35.425
raising my voice.

07:35.881 --> 07:37.208
I'm sorry.

07:39.530 --> 07:42.158
Stress is the main cause
of heart attacks.

07:42.307 --> 07:45.277
And even a little bit... well...

07:46.484 --> 07:48.706
Let me show you what stress can do.

07:53.571 --> 07:55.466
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

07:56.503 --> 07:57.778
Yes. Come on up.

08:01.385 --> 08:04.364
That's fine. Can I have your left hand
there? The back?

08:04.434 --> 08:06.018
And just relax there.

08:06.249 --> 08:08.986
I'm gonna ask you
a very personal question.

08:10.410 --> 08:11.471
There we are, you see?

08:11.813 --> 08:13.534
Sorry, I'm not gonna ask you
anything at all.

08:13.542 --> 08:15.740
That's just to show how little is needed

08:15.758 --> 08:17.890
to send downstress levels shooting up.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.360
Just a simple statement like that

08:19.372 --> 08:21.346
is registered very strongly
on the display.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.815
- Yes, another volunteer?
- Yeah.

08:22.992 --> 08:23.531
Ok.

08:23.612 --> 08:24.772
I'll have... just this off.

08:27.151 --> 08:29.639
Ah! There it goes! Yes, raise up!

08:29.687 --> 08:31.588
Look at that! Brilliant!

08:31.711 --> 08:35.135
Brilliant, excellent!
It's a super machine!

08:42.202 --> 08:43.827
Wow, great shoes!

08:43.926 --> 08:44.995
Thank you very much.

08:46.310 --> 08:48.477
I really envy women with dainty feet.

08:48.588 --> 08:49.948
What are you? A five?

08:50.409 --> 08:52.763
Yeah! Five...

08:55.873 --> 09:00.025
Well, just a little
misunderstanding there I imagine. So...

09:00.216 --> 09:02.014
- Huh let's move on... with...
- Wow!

09:02.257 --> 09:04.796
I actually haven't had a proper go yet.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.426
Well, I don't need attach... can't,
what's happened there...

09:07.479 --> 09:09.196
Actually, I don't think that's fair...

09:09.210 --> 09:10.394
I would like a go, and I think

09:10.505 --> 09:13.038
Roy should be punished for
nearly killing that lady.

09:13.093 --> 09:15.042
Well, I think I should go first!

09:15.049 --> 09:16.110
I see, well let's move on...

09:16.124 --> 09:17.851
- When did you grow a bit?
- A little go.

09:17.878 --> 09:19.820
- We gotta move on...
- And I think we could...

09:20.100 --> 09:21.096
Can we just move on?

09:21.136 --> 09:23.114
You're old ? Are you very old?

09:23.133 --> 09:24.216
Let's move on!

09:25.930 --> 09:27.296
Oh! Shut up!

09:31.517 --> 09:32.589
What are you eating?

09:32.831 --> 09:33.850
Muffin.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.751
A muffin? How can you be hungry,

09:35.779 --> 09:37.834
you ate a whole chicken
at the stress buffet!

09:39.225 --> 09:40.027
What's that?

09:40.331 --> 09:42.015
Oh, I've made a stress machine

09:42.043 --> 09:44.641
to try out for myself,
like the one in that class.

09:44.825 --> 09:45.738
Watch this.

09:46.605 --> 09:49.686
I'm  going to ask myself
a very personal question.

09:52.737 --> 09:56.262
Don't worry, I'm not really going
to ask myself any questions.

09:57.802 --> 09:59.026
Pretty good.

09:59.111 --> 10:01.947
Not as good as the one
in the stress class.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.469
The shoes!

10:26.612 --> 10:28.029
What was all that about?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.897
Well, like all the women,
she's shoe mad!

10:30.936 --> 10:32.457
It's a bit sexist, isn't it?

10:32.629 --> 10:35.032
Do you know one woman
who isn't obsessed with shoes?

10:35.118 --> 10:37.053
No, but I only know one woman.

10:37.226 --> 10:40.381
And she just left the room shouting:
"the shoes!".

11:01.757 --> 11:04.439
The needle's freaking out!

11:08.335 --> 11:10.260
Try not to hurt yourself!

11:14.268 --> 11:15.975
- Moss?
- Huh?

11:16.201 --> 11:19.182
Did you use a soldering iron
to make that stress machine?

11:19.226 --> 11:19.962
Yes.

11:20.332 --> 11:21.536
You turned it off?

11:21.626 --> 11:23.804
Oh I'm fairly sure I did!

11:25.798 --> 11:29.128
Because, you remember
what happened last time, right?

11:29.196 --> 11:31.032
Yes! That was very funny!

11:31.049 --> 11:32.363
Well no! No.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.141
It was very dangerous
and someone nearly died!

11:37.002 --> 11:38.304
Right! No! Yeah!

11:38.320 --> 11:41.227
I was thinking of a different incident.
The one on the golf course.

11:41.616 --> 11:42.605
What?

11:43.382 --> 11:45.428
I'm talking about the fire!

11:45.492 --> 11:49.230
Oh yeah, fire sorry! I always
get mixed up between golf and fire.

11:49.991 --> 11:52.315
- Just make sure it's off!
- It is off.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.260
I think.

11:53.772 --> 11:56.477
- Well just make sure it is.
- I will make sure it is.

11:57.330 --> 11:58.945
And if it's already off...

12:02.272 --> 12:04.195
I'll just walk away!

12:06.948 --> 12:11.410
Will he get off my back! What is he?
The soldering iron police?

12:14.075 --> 12:15.897
It's off...

12:16.062 --> 12:18.564
that means I turn it... on...

12:18.893 --> 12:20.882
and just walk away!

12:51.980 --> 12:54.154
Oh four! I mean five!

12:54.238 --> 12:55.423
I mean fire!

13:05.143 --> 13:07.535
Now let's see what we have here.

13:08.012 --> 13:10.192
"Stand upright."

13:11.639 --> 13:13.161
Now, I can't read it...

13:13.671 --> 13:14.826
Oh, not me!

13:14.997 --> 13:17.190
I am a giddy-goat!

13:18.696 --> 13:19.564
Okay.

13:19.831 --> 13:21.732
"Remove safety clip."

13:23.339 --> 13:25.692
- Don't look at my feet!
- Fire?

13:26.167 --> 13:27.414
Fire...

13:28.233 --> 13:28.821
No...?

13:30.325 --> 13:33.132
"Aim nozzle at base of fire."

13:38.527 --> 13:40.681
Oh, that is typical!

13:42.425 --> 13:43.964
Why has it done that?

13:44.078 --> 13:46.089
"Made in Britain"

13:54.089 --> 13:56.654
I'll just put this over here,
with the rest...

13:56.916 --> 13:58.294
of the fire.

14:04.997 --> 14:07.433
011  53... No.

14:07.641 --> 14:09.692
011 huh...

14:11.231 --> 14:14.116
0118 999...

14:17.033 --> 14:18.168
...3!

14:19.383 --> 14:22.189
Hello? Is this the emergency services?

14:23.169 --> 14:25.122
Then which country am I speaking to?

14:25.427 --> 14:27.443
Hello? Hello?

14:29.367 --> 14:30.721
I know! Yep.

14:32.276 --> 14:33.240
O kay.

14:33.978 --> 14:35.414
"Subject:..."

14:35.619 --> 14:36.727
"...fire!"

14:36.912 --> 14:38.840
"Dear Sir", stroke, "Madam."

14:38.878 --> 14:41.049
"I'm writing to inform you of a fire

14:41.076 --> 14:43.089
"which has broken out
at the premises of..."

14:43.178 --> 14:44.550
No. That's too formal.

14:48.886 --> 14:51.184
"Dear Sir", stroke, "Madam."

14:51.463 --> 14:53.777
"Fire!", exclamation mark.

14:54.072 --> 14:56.485
"Fire!", exclamation mark.

14:56.632 --> 14:59.136
"Help me!', exclamation mark.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.624
"123, Carendon road."

15:01.803 --> 15:04.111
"Looking forward to hearing from you."

15:04.383 --> 15:07.116
"All the best, Maurice Moss."

15:10.834 --> 15:15.075
What are you wearing size 5 shoes for,
woman? You're at least an 8!

15:15.110 --> 15:15.942
Eight?

15:16.001 --> 15:17.204
How dare you?!

15:17.256 --> 15:19.961
That foot is completely mangled.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.418
And the other one's even worse.

15:22.624 --> 15:24.384
You're not wearing these again.

15:24.439 --> 15:26.724
But I threw away my other shoes,

15:26.980 --> 15:28.981
what am I supposed to wear?

15:40.729 --> 15:43.139
Hello! Hello!

15:43.293 --> 15:46.165
Do you remember me?
Can I have a go in your machine now?

16:03.672 --> 16:06.051
- Oh hello again!
- Oh hi!

16:10.814 --> 16:14.781
Please thank Yamamoto San
for this fine ceremonial sword.

16:14.951 --> 16:17.693
It is a magnificent symbol
of our new merger.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.234
I am sorry that my gift...

16:22.382 --> 16:24.187
a huge pair of Doc' Martins,

16:24.620 --> 16:26.998
is extremely thick and heavy sorts.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.354
It's so poultry in comparison.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.625
Please rest assured
that my cultural advisor will be fired

16:35.669 --> 16:37.549
as soon as this meeting is over.

16:47.351 --> 16:49.374
- These are very heavy shoes.
- Yes.

16:52.984 --> 16:54.892
He feels like... Godzilla!

16:55.744 --> 16:56.484
Does he?

16:56.520 --> 16:57.260
Godzilla!

16:57.294 --> 16:59.126
Go on! Stamp your feet!

16:59.224 --> 17:00.576
Clap him man!

17:00.668 --> 17:01.416
Good!

17:02.733 --> 17:04.241
Oh yeah! Godzilla loves it !

17:04.282 --> 17:06.909
Go on! Break something!

17:10.538 --> 17:12.780
Put your weight into it!

17:14.731 --> 17:17.055
You f...... idiot!!

17:18.830 --> 17:20.314
You stupid old f.......

17:20.743 --> 17:22.375
You f....... J..........

17:22.582 --> 17:25.314
and your big m.... shoes!

17:25.571 --> 17:30.585
Oh you're not! You're nothing!
But I f... ....

17:56.444 --> 18:00.746
- I am... so... sorry, Denholm.
- That was quite a tarring Jen.

18:01.388 --> 18:02.597
It would have been even worse

18:02.633 --> 18:05.201
if Paul hadn't been so quick
on the profanity buzzer.

18:05.954 --> 18:06.952
Well done, Paul!

18:06.987 --> 18:08.731
You're back on the payroll.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.858
As for you... you're fucked up!

18:11.863 --> 18:13.781
Shouting at Japs! Mad feet!

18:13.890 --> 18:15.767
Both classic signs of stress!

18:15.825 --> 18:17.721
And you know how I feel about stress...

18:18.195 --> 18:20.249
Go to your office, and wait for me.

18:31.012 --> 18:34.300
Weirdest thing just happened... Fire!

18:34.601 --> 18:35.786
Fire!

18:35.924 --> 18:37.699
I've sent an e-mail. It's fine!

18:38.210 --> 18:40.465
An e-mail?! It's a fire! Where...

18:41.383 --> 18:43.344
Where is the precinct extinguisher ?

18:46.896 --> 18:50.992
- Made in Britain!
- This is just like the golf incident!

18:51.060 --> 18:52.181
You mean the fire incident?

18:52.197 --> 18:54.492
I mean the fire incident!
Of course I mean the fire incident!

18:54.516 --> 18:55.504
What have you got there?

18:55.538 --> 18:57.016
Oh I'm in trouble! I'm in real trouble!

18:57.044 --> 18:58.959
Help me get my shoes on!
I gotta get my shoes on!

18:59.000 --> 19:00.747
Help me get my shoes on
before Denholm comes!

19:00.775 --> 19:01.933
- Denholm's coming?
- Yeah.

19:01.944 --> 19:03.681
And he's got a... fire! Fire! Fire!

19:04.587 --> 19:07.063
I've taken care of it.

19:07.077 --> 19:09.523
I have to say I feel a little bit
insulted

19:09.541 --> 19:11.489
by the lack of faith you both display.

19:11.512 --> 19:13.176
What happened to your feet?

19:13.202 --> 19:13.993
What is this?

19:14.027 --> 19:15.637
I think a fire in the office

19:15.683 --> 19:18.292
demands a little more attention
than my feet, don't you?

19:18.309 --> 19:20.356
How... how did you get
the stress machine Roy?

19:20.444 --> 19:22.366
I... don't really know.

19:22.483 --> 19:25.432
Met Dr. Holmes by the lift.

19:25.509 --> 19:27.818
Wasn't he nice?
I thought he was a lovely man.

19:27.843 --> 19:29.452
Yes I thought he was a delight.

19:29.536 --> 19:34.639
But I met him there by the lift,
and he just went... mental!

19:35.652 --> 19:39.746
And one thing led to another
and I just... stole it!

19:40.156 --> 19:42.455
- You stole it...
- Yeah!

19:43.058 --> 19:44.775
But that's stealing!

19:45.596 --> 19:46.403
Yeah!

19:46.569 --> 19:49.624
Didn't know what a stress machine was
this morning and now we have 2 of them.

19:49.682 --> 19:51.860
I hate to remind everyone but

19:51.982 --> 19:53.113
I've just destroyed a merger

19:53.114 --> 19:55.093
that probably took hundreds of years
to set up,

19:55.189 --> 19:57.687
the office is on fire,
Denholm is furious, so

19:57.715 --> 19:59.750
could we please concentrate
on what's important,

19:59.930 --> 20:02.178
and help me out with my shoes!

20:02.278 --> 20:03.870
That could get you into trouble!

20:04.788 --> 20:05.894
Empty!

20:07.617 --> 20:08.944
Got a little bit there!

20:09.634 --> 20:12.050
Oh quick! No, no! Quick, no!

20:12.083 --> 20:13.714
These are a size 5...

20:13.849 --> 20:15.587
What are you, eight and a half?

20:15.651 --> 20:16.840
Shut up!

20:17.012 --> 20:18.562
- Come on!
- I'm pushing!

20:18.599 --> 20:20.418
Push it! Oh don't let me push you away!

20:20.425 --> 20:22.322
- Is it in?
- Come on!

20:22.366 --> 20:24.030
Push hard guy!

20:26.563 --> 20:28.293
The heel went right through!

20:28.309 --> 20:30.535
Oh my God it hurts so much!

20:31.620 --> 20:34.099
- Oh now, I'm bleeding!
- Jen!

20:34.771 --> 20:36.400
- Where are you Jen?
- It's Denholm!

20:36.508 --> 20:37.568
What?

20:38.432 --> 20:40.270
Hide the stress machine!

20:40.353 --> 20:42.903
The stress machine?
What about the fire?!

20:42.943 --> 20:45.168
Ok! Put the stress machine
in Jen's room!

20:45.183 --> 20:47.122
- He'll never go in there!
- But what if he does?

20:47.137 --> 20:48.851
It doesn't matter!
He won't know what it is!

20:48.916 --> 20:50.644
I can't go to prison Roy!

20:50.723 --> 20:52.471
They'll rape the flip out of me!

20:56.374 --> 20:58.102
You! Stall him by the door!

20:58.134 --> 20:59.683
I stall... How?

20:59.745 --> 21:01.421
I don't know! Use your womanly ways!

21:01.488 --> 21:04.167
Ok Moss! Pass me that monitor screen.
The broken one.

21:07.237 --> 21:08.264
There you are!

21:08.931 --> 21:09.774
Hello there!

21:09.893 --> 21:12.193
It's no use being womanly with me Jen!

21:12.521 --> 21:13.954
You're in big trouble!

21:15.861 --> 21:16.782
Nice screensaver!

21:20.070 --> 21:21.071
Thank you.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.654
A stress machine!

21:27.120 --> 21:28.282
Just  what we need!

21:28.841 --> 21:30.210
Roll up your sleeves, Jen.

21:30.386 --> 21:31.582
Let's get this over with.

21:34.188 --> 21:36.787
It's a one way ticket
to slammer town for us Roy.

21:36.842 --> 21:38.383
With no return ticket!

21:41.074 --> 21:44.504
I really am losing quite a lot of blood!

21:44.657 --> 21:46.449
You understand this is your last chance?

21:46.648 --> 21:48.070
If the needle goes beyond here...

21:48.202 --> 21:49.474
you will be fired!

21:50.392 --> 21:51.995
Does that make you feel stressed?

21:52.405 --> 21:54.133
Jen! Does it?

21:54.349 --> 21:55.689
No? Are you sure?

21:55.852 --> 21:56.737
Are you sure?

21:57.110 --> 21:58.057
Are you sure?

21:58.296 --> 21:59.128
Are you sure?

21:59.419 --> 22:00.313
Are you sure?

22:00.649 --> 22:01.570
Are you sure?

22:01.828 --> 22:02.764
Are you sure?

22:03.072 --> 22:04.054
Are you sure?

22:04.234 --> 22:05.188
Are you sure?

22:05.423 --> 22:06.556
Are you sure?

22:06.653 --> 22:07.676
Are you sure?

22:07.883 --> 22:08.865
Are you sure?

22:08.962 --> 22:10.482
I'll level with you Roy.

22:10.552 --> 22:13.165
I don't think I'd flourish
in a prison environment.

22:15.061 --> 22:16.854
Could I try on your new glasses?

22:18.172 --> 22:19.554
See this balloon, Jen?

22:20.024 --> 22:21.434
I'm gonna burst it.

22:21.628 --> 22:23.135
But I'm not gonna tell you when...

22:24.700 --> 22:27.075
Do you feel stressed Jen? Jen? Jen?

22:27.208 --> 22:28.124
Look at that!

22:29.640 --> 22:30.985
That's your peace of mind!

22:31.082 --> 22:32.401
And it's gonna go bang!

22:33.533 --> 22:35.267
Do you feel stress now, Jen?

22:35.385 --> 22:35.872
Jen!

22:37.723 --> 22:41.110
Jen! Jen! Do you?!

22:42.685 --> 22:43.930
Evidently not.

22:45.312 --> 22:46.885
Well done Jen!

22:47.230 --> 22:49.269
You're not being fired by me...

22:49.477 --> 22:50.946
at this precise moment.

22:56.095 --> 22:59.008
I love the way the smoke
seems to be coming off the top of it.

23:01.553 --> 23:02.914
Just a second...

23:05.463 --> 23:06.824
I'm late for golf!

23:14.094 --> 23:16.321
I wonder why it didn't work...

23:17.908 --> 23:20.271
"Made In Britain"

23:22.667 --> 23:24.960
I don't know if it's the loss of blood

23:24.981 --> 23:28.991
or the melting plastic from the monitor
but I feel great!

23:31.626 --> 23:35.514
It's so ironic but this entire situation
has been quite stressful.

23:37.307 --> 23:38.604
I'll get help...

23:41.675 --> 23:44.295
You sent an e-mail about a fire?
