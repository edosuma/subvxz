[ Dog Barking ]

00:46.700 --> 00:50.367
[ Man ]
Goosebumps.

00:51.467 --> 00:54.333
Viewer beware.

00:54.333 --> 00:56.333
You're in for a scare.

00:56.833 --> 00:58.333
[ Chuckles ]

01:13.800 --> 01:15.967
- Can I ask you something?
- [ Woman Snoring ]

01:16.467 --> 01:18.633
Is that really true
about the monster blood?

01:19.133 --> 01:21.133
- I already told you it was.
- [ Boy ] Hey, punk.

01:21.133 --> 01:24.133
Not you.
The other punk.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.267
What's this monster blood junk
you guys are talking about?

01:26.700 --> 01:29.067
- Just leave me alone, Conan.
- Yeah, you gonna make me?

01:29.067 --> 01:31.467
Hey, Conehead, why don't you
just give it a rest, huh?

01:31.900 --> 01:32.967
Butt out, Julia.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.400
I just wanna know what
this monster blood stuff is.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.400
Monster blood? What's that?

01:36.400 --> 01:38.967
This guy's been telling me about
this monster blood stuff...

01:39.533 --> 01:41.967
that almost totally destroyed
a whole neighborhood.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.267
Yeah? Right.

01:44.267 --> 01:46.500
You don't have to believe me,
but it's true.

01:46.933 --> 01:48.333
His name's Evan.
This is Julia.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.167
And the Neanderthal is Conan.

01:51.167 --> 01:53.867
Watch it, bozo.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.700
So tell me about
this monster blood.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.400
Basically, monster blood is
this green kind of oozy stuff...

02:00.400 --> 02:03.600
that grows and devours
everything in its path.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.967
And it almost swallowed him
up, but his dog saved him.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.833
It's true. At first,
Trigger ate some of it,

02:07.833 --> 02:10.433
and he grew up to
the size of a house.

02:10.933 --> 02:11.933
Then we destroyed
the monster blood,

02:11.933 --> 02:13.500
and he returned to his normal size.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.500
- Trigger's on the plane too.
- Yeah.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.933
He's down below with the suitcases.

02:17.933 --> 02:19.400
[ Laughs ]
Who is this guy?

02:19.400 --> 02:20.767
That's the dumbest story
I've ever heard.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.167
Curtis, you'd believe anything.

02:23.567 --> 02:25.967
I didn't say I believed it.

02:25.967 --> 02:28.400
So you guys are all friends?

02:28.400 --> 02:32.200
We went to camp together.
I don't think Conan has any friends.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.267
No, I'm not little Miss Rich Girl who
can buy all the friends she needs.

02:35.767 --> 02:37.833
You know what?
You're so lame.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.767
Look, you don't have to believe me.

02:39.767 --> 02:41.967
But it's true. I was there.

02:42.467 --> 02:45.033
Sure, and I was there when
my cousin turned into a werewolf.

02:45.533 --> 02:49.033
[ Howls, Laughs ]

02:49.033 --> 02:51.033
Return to your seat, please.
Dinner will be served soon.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.800
It's about time.
I'm starved.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.300
I bet Trigger's gettin' hungry too.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.067
Poor boy.

02:59.933 --> 03:01.253
[ Barking ]

03:19.833 --> 03:22.833
[ Snoring ]

03:24.333 --> 03:26.100
And I thought the food
at the camp was gross.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.100
[ Julia ] Well, it's better than
the stuff we get at school.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.600
You should've seen my old school.
They served this pudding.

03:31.600 --> 03:36.100
It had this skin-- It was like
you could play drums on it.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.600
This stuff's even worse.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.733
I mean, I don't even know
what it's supposed to be.

03:39.733 --> 03:44.000
Excuse me. Excuse me?

03:44.500 --> 03:47.233
I don't think I should be eating this.
I'm allergic to stuff.

03:47.233 --> 03:51.367
- What kind of stuff?
- All milk products, all food additives,

03:51.367 --> 03:54.300
monosodium glutamate, monocalcium
phosphates, peanuts, shellfish,

03:54.733 --> 03:56.933
bee stings, fur-bearing
animals, synthetic fabrics...

03:57.433 --> 03:59.467
as well as all pollen spores and fungi.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.967
Oh, and mints.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.167
When we were at camp, all he'd
eat was parsnip juice and tofu.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.667
It's really not that bad.

04:20.666 --> 04:24.567
[ Slithering ]

04:24.567 --> 04:27.567
- [ Thump ]
- Did you feel that?

04:27.567 --> 04:30.700
- [ Man ] Sure did.
- Better check this out.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.667
[ Snoring Continues ]

04:36.667 --> 04:40.667
- [ Snorts ]
- [ Girl Laughs ]

04:46.167 --> 04:48.667
A giraffe.
That's pretty good.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.867
Thanks.

04:50.867 --> 04:51.867
So--

04:54.633 --> 04:56.900
Do you live in Atlanta?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.900
My dad just got transferred there.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.500
I'm just flying out now
to meet him and my mom.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.500
Hmm.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.800
So, um, did you guys all know each
other before you went to camp?

05:06.800 --> 05:09.300
Well, we all go
to the same school,

05:09.300 --> 05:11.267
but we don't really hang
out or anything at home.

05:11.267 --> 05:14.400
Maybe I'll be
in the same school as you.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.800
Maybe.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.500
- I could introduce you around.
- That'd be cool.

05:22.467 --> 05:27.467
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I'll take a look.

05:27.967 --> 05:29.467
I gotta go below.

05:29.467 --> 05:30.967
The captain thinks there's some
cargo rolling around down there.

05:31.467 --> 05:32.967
I'll hold down the fort.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.600
[ Whistling ]

05:56.700 --> 05:57.950
Whoa.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.567

06:28.633 --> 06:31.400

06:39.300 --> 06:41.833

- [ Evan ] What's wrong?

06:42.333 --> 06:44.833

- Help me! Help me!

06:44.833 --> 06:45.833
[ Woman ] Stewardess!

06:45.833 --> 06:47.900
I've got it. Okay?
I've got it. It's gone.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.333
[ Conan ] It's just a little ant.
I got it from that old lady's flower.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.167
You're such a creep, Conan.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.167
If I have to settle
you boys down one more time,

06:55.167 --> 06:57.533
I will have the captain
back here to speak to you.

06:57.533 --> 06:58.867
- Is that understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.867
- He started it.
- That's right.

07:01.867 --> 07:04.367
Now, I don't care. You're
disturbing the other passengers.

07:04.867 --> 07:07.367

[ Snoring, Snorting ]

07:27.233 --> 07:29.233
- Oh. [ Chuckles ]
- Uh--

07:29.233 --> 07:31.733
- Okay.
- Yeah. Sorry.

07:31.733 --> 07:33.733
- It's okay. No problem.
- Yeah.

Ten minutes.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.967
[ Woman ]
Can I go before you? Because--

08:39.467 --> 08:40.467
[ Man ]
I don't think so.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.867
[ Slithering ]

08:48.033 --> 08:50.533
No. It can't be.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.800
I was workin' on my computer,
and I looked away for just a second.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.000
I looked back, and it was gone.
It vanished.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.433
- Monster blood!
- What?

09:01.433 --> 09:03.800
It's here. Monster blood.
You gotta believe me.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.633
- Tell the captain to land the plane.
- [ Cabin Bell Dings ]

09:06.633 --> 09:10.133
Can I talk to you for half a sec?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.633
Uh, you may not be aware of this,

09:12.633 --> 09:15.233
but causing a panic on an
aircraft is a federal offense.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.367
- [ Bell Dings ]
- You could get in serious trouble for this.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.500
Now stay in your seat.
Am I making myself clear?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.700
I don't care.
You gotta do something.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.467
- It's in the bathroom.
- [ Sighs ]

09:23.467 --> 09:24.800
What is in the bathroom?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.767
 I already told you!
The monster blood!

09:26.767 --> 09:29.100
[ Conan ]
Here he goes again.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.867
You don't understand.
It can swallow us all!

09:30.867 --> 09:33.900
Just relax, ladies and gentlemen.
Nothing to worry about.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.933
- [ Bell Dinging ]
- You, move it.

09:37.433 --> 09:38.933
What about my computer?

09:39.433 --> 09:41.933
Stay away from that door!
It's in there!

09:41.933 --> 09:43.933
Nothing to be alarmed about.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.633
This is your flight attendant.

09:48.633 --> 09:51.133
Everything all right in there?

09:51.133 --> 09:53.267
Do you require any assistance?

09:56.733 --> 10:00.000
Hello?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.767
Don't open it!

10:08.600 --> 10:11.233
[ Woman ]
Ooh! Ow.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.500
- It was empty.
- I saw it in there. I know I did.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.933
It's escaped.
We have to find it.

10:36.433 --> 10:39.433
The only thing that you are
going to find is your seat--

10:39.433 --> 10:41.333
for the rest of this flight.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.700
- I'm so sorry.
- [ Woman ] That's all right.

10:45.133 --> 10:49.067
I know you guys think
I'm crazy, but it's true.

10:49.067 --> 10:50.067
Tell her that
I'm not just making this up.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.733
He's not with us.
We don't even know this guy.

10:54.233 --> 10:56.167
Total space cadet.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.667
Then where did the guy go?
The door was locked from the inside.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.500
I'll grant you it's peculiar.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.767
But that is no excuse for frightening
everyone with this nonsense.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.700
Let's try to be logical, okay?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.700
We're hurtling through
the sky at 37,000 feet.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.033
Where could it have
possibly come from?

11:10.033 --> 11:12.800
A little piece could have
gotten into Evan's suitcase.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.467
[ Evan ]
Well, it's possible.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.867
It doesn't take much.
It grows for no reason.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.300
It just keeps growing
and growing and growing.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.300
[ Bell Continues Dinging ]

11:22.300 --> 11:24.400
Have you seen
the other flight attendant?

11:24.400 --> 11:26.833
- No.
- I haven't.

11:26.833 --> 11:30.033
All of you sit tight.
I'll be right back.

11:30.033 --> 11:33.500
I'm not lying, you guys.
You've gotta help me convince them.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.000
I need to get through, please.

12:25.833 --> 12:29.267
Evan, she said to wait here.

12:29.267 --> 12:32.267
I don't care.
I know what I saw.

12:32.267 --> 12:34.067
Now, if I don't come right back,

12:34.067 --> 12:38.133
promise me that you'll go to the
captain and make him land this plane.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.000
- Get serious.
- I've never been more serious in my life.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.733
Monster blood is on this plane.
I saw it, and I heard it.

12:44.733 --> 12:47.233
Heard it?

12:47.733 --> 12:50.233
Yeah, when it crawled
under the bathroom door.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.733
So what does it sound like?

12:53.233 --> 12:56.567
[ Sighs ]
I can't explain it, but it's awful.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.567
Kind of a slurping sound.
It's hard to put into words.

13:00.567 --> 13:02.200
But once you've heard it,
you never forget it.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.833

- [ Screams ]

13:22.800 --> 13:25.433
[ Slurping Continues ]

13:25.933 --> 13:27.900
- Now do you believe me?
- We believe you--

13:27.900 --> 13:29.800
- [ Loud Belch ]
- big time.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.500
[ Thunderclaps ]

13:36.300 --> 13:38.233
- [ Conan ] It ate them.
- And we're next.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.633
- Maybe it's full.
- I don't think it gets full.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.433
It's all your fault.
You brought this stuff on board.

13:43.000 --> 13:43.900
I don't need your--

13:43.900 --> 13:47.067
I don't care! This stuff's
gonna get us, thanks to you.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.067
No, it's not! Just shut up!

13:48.567 --> 13:50.133
Yes, it is. I don't wanna shut up.
It's his fault!

13:50.633 --> 13:52.967
[ Loud Whistle ]
We need to approach this rationally.

13:52.967 --> 13:56.233
There's nothing rational
about this stuff.

13:56.233 --> 14:00.600
Last time, it stayed runny.
This time, it's more "blobby."

14:00.600 --> 14:03.200
I think I prefer the smooth
to the chunky style.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.267
[ Airplane Hull Shakes ]

14:07.267 --> 14:10.200
Everybody split up.
Maybe we can confuse it.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.933
- [ Conan ] Will that work?
- I don't know. I'm learning as I go.

Too cool.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.533
What, that we're gonna
be a midnight snack?

14:32.533 --> 14:35.333
No. It went after that cassette
player. It senses movement.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.700
- [ Hull Shakes ]
- I think you're right.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.033

stuff-- everything you can find!

- Yeah? Here!

Eat that!

15:10.233 --> 15:14.000
[ All Groaning ]

15:14.000 --> 15:17.233
- Oh, man!    - Gross!
- That's disgusting.

15:17.233 --> 15:20.967
No.
It's an incredible discovery.

15:20.967 --> 15:23.333
Airline food
makes the monster blood sick.

15:23.333 --> 15:27.100
- [ Evan ] Maybe that's how we can stop it.
- Or at least slow it down.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.300
Now what's the plan?
It's looking mean and green again.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.400
[ Julia ]
Somebody think of something.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.233
I have an idea.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.800
They keep the food cart in
the back of the plane, right?

15:37.300 --> 15:38.800
If we feed it enough airline food,
we might kill it.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.367
[ Conan ] How are we supposed
to get to the cart?

15:41.867 --> 15:44.300
Okay, um, it's too risky to
climb over the seats, right?

15:44.300 --> 15:47.633
It'd sense our movement
and attack for sure, right?

15:47.633 --> 15:50.700
The bins overhead are like a tunnel.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.967
We could just crawl past the monster
blood to the back of the plane.

15:54.967 --> 15:57.800
- Come on. Let's get this outta here.
- Come on, guys. Hurry.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.600
- I'll go.
- No. I don't think you'll fit.

16:08.500 --> 16:13.033
- She-She'll fit.
- Curtis, it looks like it's up to you.

16:13.033 --> 16:15.533
But she'll fit.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.467
There's dust up there.

16:17.467 --> 16:20.067
Allergies are the least
of your worries right now.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.000
[ Conan ] Come on, Curtis.
You're our only hope.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.267
- [ Julia ] You can do it.
- Right.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.667
My mom's gonna kill me.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.500
[ Julia ] Come on, you guys.
It's coming. Hurry.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.267
Okay. Now, once you get
past the monster blood,

16:34.267 --> 16:36.267
go right to the food.

16:36.767 --> 16:38.933
Don't worry about us.
Get-- Get to the food.

16:38.933 --> 16:40.933
Okay?

16:43.067 --> 16:44.567
[ Grunts ]

16:48.133 --> 16:50.467
[ Curtis Coughing ]

16:50.467 --> 16:52.933
[ Curtis Sneezes ]

16:52.933 --> 16:55.700
[ Grunting ]

16:55.700 --> 16:58.900
It's dusty, man. Uh!

17:07.367 --> 17:10.666
Hey, you guys!
I made it!

17:16.532 --> 17:18.532
[ Hull Shakes ]

17:18.532 --> 17:22.333
- [ Julia ] Curtis!
- Try to stay still!

17:22.333 --> 17:25.267
- Curtis! Get the cart! Go for the cart!
- No!

17:25.267 --> 17:29.267
- [ Hull Shakes ]
- [ Groaning ]

17:29.267 --> 17:31.133
Conan!

17:31.133 --> 17:34.433
- [ Julia ] No!
- Hey! Tall, green and ugly!

17:34.433 --> 17:35.933
Come here, you big green blob.

17:35.933 --> 17:37.933
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

17:37.933 --> 17:40.267
Hurry up. Get the cart.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.633
Aw, no!

17:44.300 --> 17:47.000
It's comin' right for me.

17:47.967 --> 17:51.200
[ Screaming ]
No!

17:51.200 --> 17:53.300
Conan!

17:53.733 --> 17:56.533
- [ Screams ]
- Conan!

17:56.533 --> 17:58.733
Evan, no!

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
Aw, man.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.000
- [ Hull Shakes ]
- It just swallowed him.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.567
The food cart!

18:10.333 --> 18:12.800
- It won't move!
- The brakes must be on.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.833
There's gotta be
a switch or something.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.667
Well, I can't find it.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.333
I'll try to stall it.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.300
- Yeah, yeah! Here I am!
- Julia! No!

18:23.900 --> 18:27.400
Come and get me! Yeah, you!
Big, green and ugly!

18:27.900 --> 18:30.633
- I got it! Now try it!
- Yes! Ready?

18:30.633 --> 18:32.400
Come on!

18:33.567 --> 18:36.633
- Banzai!
- [ Yells ]

18:41.700 --> 18:44.067
[ Slurping ]

18:46.500 --> 18:48.800
[ Belching ]

19:00.533 --> 19:02.833
[ Groans ]
Gross.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.100
[ Belches ]

19:06.100 --> 19:10.267
[ On PA ] Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be starting our descent soon.

19:10.267 --> 19:13.267
At this time, I'd like to ask
you to close your tray table...

19:13.267 --> 19:15.233
and return your chair
to the full upright position.

19:15.233 --> 19:19.733
- [ Man Groaning ]
- [ Woman ] Ow.

19:20.733 --> 19:23.733
- [ Woman ] How--
- [ Woman #2 ] Oh, my head.

19:26.133 --> 19:29.133
Can you get off my foot, please?

19:29.133 --> 19:32.033
- Thank you.
- [ People Chattering ]

19:32.033 --> 19:33.500
Conan.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.100
- Yep. That's me.
- [ Curtis ] All right! Conan!

19:36.600 --> 19:37.967
[ Woman Snoring ]

19:37.967 --> 19:40.467
[ Laughs ]
My computer.

19:40.967 --> 19:42.967
It automatically saved.
All right.

19:43.967 --> 19:45.933
- Great.
- Yeah!

19:45.933 --> 19:48.300
[ Chattering Continues ]

19:49.233 --> 19:52.700
- [ Barking ]
- All right! Trigger!

19:53.700 --> 19:56.700
Hey.
Hey, guys, this is Trigger.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.933
- Trigger, Trigger.
- [ Sneezes ]

20:06.300 --> 20:09.200
[ Airplane Descending ]

20:14.200 --> 20:17.200
[ Captain ] That's it? That's
what caused all of this damage?

20:17.200 --> 20:19.200
What the heck is this stuff anyway?

20:19.200 --> 20:22.700
I told you, Captain.
It's monster blood.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.200
I need a suit like this.
No germs.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.700
Yeah. Come on, Curtis.
I want you to meet my family.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.700
Conan. What was it like
being inside the monster blood?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.700
It was kind of like being
stuck inside a giant nose.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.700
[ Laughs ]

20:39.700 --> 20:42.200
Call me if you feel like it.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.200
I know what it's like to
be the new kid in town.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.200
- Thanks.
- Mmm.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.200
And thanks for, well,
you know, what you did.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.700
Hey.
It was the highlight of my summer.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.200
[ Laughs ]

20:55.700 --> 20:58.200
Oh.
I almost forgot my jacket.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.700
I'll be right back.
Uh, sorry. Sorry.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.267
So then I go back,
I call for the steward,

21:03.267 --> 21:05.200
and I get this green stuff
on my hand.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.700
And the next thing I know--

21:07.700 --> 21:08.833
[ Chittering ]

21:09.467 --> 21:12.700
[ Screams ]
