00:05.505 --> 00:08.140
Available sales
to the showroom, please.

00:09.242 --> 00:10.609
Look...

00:12.178 --> 00:14.413
I know how people feel
about car salesmen.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.283
Most of the time,
i completely understand.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.755
You might not
believe this, but...

00:25.225 --> 00:28.761
I can't tell you
how much I wanna build
something different.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.343
Man: I know.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.078
Honey, I know.
I hear you.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.180
Woman, on telephone:
I really don't think you do.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.715
No, I do. I'm--

00:49.717 --> 00:51.550
mark, please.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.786
I really do.
Yeah? Okay, so?

00:53.788 --> 00:55.521
Ashley, you're right.
I promise--

00:55.523 --> 00:57.790
I've had this reservation
for a month.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.058
You're absolutely right.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.559
Yeah. Okay.
I just can't--

01:00.561 --> 01:02.628
then I'll
see you at 5:00.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.328
No, I can't. I--

01:04.331 --> 01:05.597
who makes
a reservation--

01:05.599 --> 01:07.366
can't we just
push it to tomorrow?

01:07.368 --> 01:10.636
Mark, I need you
to understand what
this feels like.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.471
Uh, okay. Okay.
I understand.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.839
I do. No, I do. I do.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.507
But you need
to understand,
too, okay?

01:15.509 --> 01:17.443
I am under
a lot of pressure here.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.777
I'm not just--
we've talked about this,

01:18.779 --> 01:20.379
and you're the one
who told me.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.214
- Yes, I know.
- ...To the floor.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.348
I know. I know.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.117
Stop being a wimp, then.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.152
I know,
and I meant that.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.121
Okay, but you need
to listen, all right?

01:29.123 --> 01:30.322
You just--
no, understand.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.491
You know him, all right?
You know my dad,

01:32.493 --> 01:34.359
and he is killing me
right now.

01:34.361 --> 01:37.296
Today I have had to do
some things that...

01:37.298 --> 01:39.698
That I'm
not exactly proud of,

01:39.700 --> 01:41.467
and I need you, okay?

01:41.469 --> 01:42.801
I just need you
on my team.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.803
I need you on my team
for one day, please.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.338
I've always been
on your team, mark.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.639
You are the one
who's canceling on me.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.141
You just don't get it!

01:49.143 --> 01:50.676
Well, why don't you
explain it to me then?

01:50.678 --> 01:52.177
Because I don't
have time, okay?

01:52.179 --> 01:54.246
Don't have time
on our anniversary?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.882
No, I don't have time,
because I'm supposed to
be on the floor, okay?

01:56.884 --> 02:00.252
Because I have a number
that I have to hit
by the end of the day,

02:00.254 --> 02:02.421
and once I do
hit that number,
i swear to god

02:02.423 --> 02:04.623
everything
is gonna be different
for you and me, okay?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.558
I promise. And I'm
not only talking about

02:06.560 --> 02:08.526
all the money that
I'm gonna bring home,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.162
but about the time
and attention

02:10.163 --> 02:12.397
I'm gonna be able
to give our marriage,

02:12.399 --> 02:14.700
our relationship, okay?
Ash?

02:17.537 --> 02:18.537
Ash?

02:35.355 --> 02:36.488
Boss, I got nothin'.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.323
She's 70, right?
Right.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.791
Then she sure as shit
didn't come down here

02:39.793 --> 02:41.326
just to kick some tires,
now, did she?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.228
100, 200, something,

02:43.230 --> 02:44.830
anything,
whatever it takes.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.733
Available sales
to the showroom.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.502
Available sales
to the showroom.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.638
Salesman:
No problem.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.406
Green pea.

02:55.608 --> 02:56.608
Hmm?
Yeah, you.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.177
My name's Tyler.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.212
No, it's not.
It's green pea.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.314
You get a name
when you sell a car.
Who's training you?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.515
He's--

03:05.352 --> 03:08.420
Charlie, show Mr. baldrich
to his new vehicle.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.488
Yes.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.923
Zig ziglar
just closed number 15,

03:10.925 --> 03:13.358
and I hope that roley
has a big band.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.295
I like to wear my watches
nice and loose.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.863
Hey, are you
training this?

03:19.465 --> 03:20.866
I'm facilitating
his career.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.235
Well, then please do so,
because I don't need him

03:23.237 --> 03:24.736
standing
on the showroom floor,

03:24.738 --> 03:27.439
looking like
a lost puppy that
can't find his mom.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.540
Come on, simba.
Let's go.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.275
Hey! Mother-daughter
two-car deal.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.411
Where we at?
They'll be here in an hour.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.846
Better be, 'cause
according to this,
you only have 3 1/2.

03:34.848 --> 03:35.881
Mark: Where we at?

03:35.883 --> 03:36.982
Well, Christian's
make 15.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.584
I just closed
Caleb's for 16,

03:38.586 --> 03:40.419
which means we
got about 3 1/2 hours

03:40.421 --> 03:42.487
to sell another 19.
The good news?

03:42.489 --> 03:43.622
You'll be lucky
if that number

03:43.624 --> 03:45.224
doesn't jump back up
to 20 or 21.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.825
What? Why?

03:46.827 --> 03:47.926
Yes, because Christian's
mother-daughter
two-car deal

03:47.928 --> 03:49.461
has yet to show.
Yeah, I know.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.929
And Sharon's guy
from yesterday called.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.764
Whoa. Wait, the guy
that was hitting
on her all day?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.266
Yes, him.
What?

03:54.268 --> 03:55.934
What did he
call about?
What does he want?

03:55.936 --> 03:58.303
He called her to tell 'em
he's on his way back in.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.638
His way back in
to do what?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.607
Unwind. What the fuck
do you think, mark?

04:01.609 --> 04:02.608
Fuck.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.809
Yeah, fuck.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.978
You got your work
cut out for you, mark.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.548
Could you give us
a minute, please, Caleb?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.750
Look, Boyd, I get it.
You're pissed off,

04:11.752 --> 04:13.652
and that's fine,
but don't pretend

04:13.654 --> 04:15.854
like you don't
have something
at stake here, too.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.457
So, please,
wait till 5:00 P.M.
before you crucify me.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.326
I'm not here
to crucify you, okay?

04:21.327 --> 04:22.995
But that shit that happened
with Scott today

04:22.997 --> 04:25.264
was a chickenshit move,
and you know it.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.599
Look, I know it's not easy
working for your old man,
but you gonna have--

04:27.601 --> 04:29.468
don't go there.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.471
Look, if anybody deserves
a bullet in their head

04:32.473 --> 04:33.739
around here,
it's Reynolds.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.743
Got one, baby.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.411
Fuck.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.512
"Fuck" is right.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.947
This mooch,

04:41.949 --> 04:43.715
this credit criminal,
this is the guy

04:43.717 --> 04:45.517
you spent
the last three hours with.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.519
He's that bad?
Shit.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.621
This guy couldn't buy
love from his mother, Quinn.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.029
Heh. You like jokes?

04:57.031 --> 04:58.964
Fuck you.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.932
Now go throw
this cocksucker out

05:00.934 --> 05:03.402
and grab another up,
or better yet,
you know what?

05:03.404 --> 05:05.604
Don't until you learn
how to do your fucking job.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.040
Eh?

05:08.042 --> 05:09.908
Caleb, board.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.910
All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.512
It's just after 1:30,

05:13.514 --> 05:16.581
which means we have
less than 3 1/2 hours

05:16.583 --> 05:19.318
to put another 19 sleds
on the road.

05:19.320 --> 05:24.022
So if you're looking
forward to seeing your
paychecks on Monday

05:24.024 --> 05:27.659
or to getting
a portion of this wad
of spiff money I have,

05:27.661 --> 05:30.562
then I want you all
to pull your heads
out of your asses

05:30.564 --> 05:33.465
right now, because
the clock is ticking,

05:33.467 --> 05:36.001
and with
16 cars boarded,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.537
300 is very long,
long way to go,
so let's go!

05:38.539 --> 05:40.005
Let's go! Let's go!
Go get it.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.708
Wow. Moving.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.975
Reynolds,
what's your problem?

05:43.977 --> 05:45.377
My problem?

05:45.379 --> 05:47.512
Mark, I'm not
the one who's been

05:47.514 --> 05:49.915
walking around here
all day, crying
about scottie.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.784
Shit, if you ask me,
we should have fired
his ass months ago.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.919
And yet no one asked you.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.687
You know,
it's funny, Boyd.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.357
Why is it that
you're only tough
when he's around?

05:58.359 --> 06:00.692
Hey, you feeling froggy,
Reynolds, just jump.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.461
You know, come
to think of it, mark,

06:02.463 --> 06:04.930
with all the rope
you've given Scott
this last six months,

06:04.932 --> 06:06.365
you could have
hung two people.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.499
Oh, you son of a bitch.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.735
Let's go,
you and me right now.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.037
Like I said, Boyd,
you're only tough
when he's around.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.506
Well, try that shit
when he's not around,
motherfucker.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.507
Hey! Hey!
'Cause I will kick

06:15.509 --> 06:17.109
your motherfucking ass,
man!

06:17.111 --> 06:18.643
I will break
your fucking neck!

06:19.780 --> 06:21.680
Woman: Hey! Hey!

06:21.682 --> 06:23.582
You know, if I thought
it would help,

06:23.584 --> 06:26.785
I suggest the two of you
just drop your pants and
get it over with,

06:26.787 --> 06:29.521
but I'm afraid that
wouldn't pan out so well
for Reynolds.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.056
You're damn right it won't.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.592
Actually, with the size
of your dick, Sharon,

06:33.594 --> 06:34.760
my money's on you.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.561
Ah. Ah. Not today.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.896
You know, one of these days,

06:37.898 --> 06:39.831
I'm gonna let him
beat the shit out of you.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.600
Oh, are you?
Are you, really?

06:41.602 --> 06:43.635
Hey, can we get back
to selling cars and
my little problem?

06:43.637 --> 06:46.104
Yeah. I heard.
So what's his deal?

06:46.106 --> 06:49.641
Other than he
wants to unwind,
i don't know.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.510
Maybe he's coming
out of the ether.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.112
That or
his old lady told him
to bring it back.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.480
Okay, well,
just so you know,

06:55.482 --> 06:56.648
I'm not unwinding shit,
not today.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.150
Man: You guys
fucked me here!

06:58.152 --> 07:00.919
I told the both of you
i need to speak
to the owner.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.821
I know my rights.
I'm returning this car.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.590
No. No. Sharon,
i told you I am not
unwinding shit.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.160
I don't care
how mad he gets,
he better enjoy his new car,

07:08.162 --> 07:09.895
and if he has
a problem with that,

07:09.897 --> 07:11.663
then he better
find himself a new wife.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.731
Yo, boss.
What?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.466
Yours is sitting
in your office.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.968
Where's the owner?
I know my fucking rights.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.170
Shit.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.439
Sharon: You can
say that again.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.575
I need to
speak to the owner
right fucking now!

07:25.679 --> 07:28.947
Mark, line two.
Mark, line two.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.582
Right fucking now!

07:35.521 --> 07:37.155
Sharon: You can
say that again.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.024
I need to speak
to the owner right now!

07:39.026 --> 07:41.560
No. No, Sharon, I told you
i am not unwinding shit.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.061
Yo, boss.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.596
Pull your heads
out of your asses

07:44.598 --> 07:47.566
right now,
because the clock
is ticking.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.534
Look, I know it's not easy
working for your old man,
but you gonna have--

07:49.536 --> 07:51.102
don't go there.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.537
Mother-daughter
two-car deal,
where we at?

07:52.539 --> 07:54.940
They'll be here in an hour.
Better be.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.675
My name's Tyler.
No, it's green pea.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.909
You get a name
when you sell a car.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.678
Whatever it takes!

07:59.680 --> 08:01.046
I've had to do some things

08:01.048 --> 08:02.981
that I'm
not exactly proud of.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.649
Mark, they believe you,

08:04.651 --> 08:05.984
and you go,
and you pull this shit.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.586
Bullshit, Boyd!

08:07.588 --> 08:09.054
I need someone
to step up.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.022
What do you
need me to do?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.991
Some of us
have to fight.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.026
It's what you
have to do to get
what you want.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.095
Fuck you.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.164
What do I tell them?
What do you tell them?!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.199
What's the catch?
You still don't get it,

08:21.201 --> 08:22.834
do you, mark?
But if I were you,

08:22.836 --> 08:25.570
I would tell them to hit
300 fucking cars.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.105
Now, do you understand me?!
All: Yes!

08:27.107 --> 08:29.241
Come on! I said,
"do you understand me?!"

08:29.243 --> 08:30.242
Yes!
Yes!

08:30.244 --> 08:31.543
Let's get fired up

08:31.545 --> 08:33.111
and go sell
some fucking cars!

10:01.133 --> 10:02.667
morning.

10:02.669 --> 10:03.768
Hey, Andy. Morning.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.003
Conference room, guys.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.905
Hey. Good morning.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.239
Could you, uh,
page everyone

10:08.241 --> 10:09.674
to the conference room,
please?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.142
Certainly.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.079
All sales associates
to the conference room,
please.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.048
All sales associates
to the conference room
immediately.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.894
Hmm.

10:32.231 --> 10:35.700
Okay. Don't get
into too much trouble today.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.168
Mark.
Yeah?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.303
Coffee.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.005
Come on.
You know that was for you.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.039
Have a good one.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.107
You, too.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.178
Fellas,
that means you.
Come on.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.780
Let's go.
Conference room.

10:48.782 --> 10:49.981
Hey, boss.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.784
Hey, um, I don't mean
to be an ass,

10:52.786 --> 10:55.353
but, uh,
did I hear right?

10:55.355 --> 10:56.955
We're not getting paid
on Monday?

10:56.957 --> 10:58.056
You did.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.192
I know you're
concerned, Quinn.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.062
Trust me.
I'm looking into it.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.263
Talk about it
in the meeting.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.932
I-it's just that Sarah--

11:07.934 --> 11:10.168
my Sarah's been
calling me every 10 minutes,
freaking out,

11:10.170 --> 11:12.003
and I don't know
what to tell her.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.005
Not only is
our rent due Monday,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.041
but we're way behind
on almost all of our bills,

11:16.043 --> 11:19.678
and I'm already,
like, two weeks late
on our car payment.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.945
Yeah, Quinn...

11:22.281 --> 11:24.282
I'm working on it.

11:25.919 --> 11:26.951
Yeah.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.922
Hey.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.158
How much is
that car payment?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.926
250 bucks.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.262
I'll see you
at the meeting.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.297
Christian:
Let's just say,

11:39.299 --> 11:41.166
wanna see
the Gauge spin.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.233
Hey.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.334
Did you really close

11:43.336 --> 11:45.236
that two-car
mother-daughter deal?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.105
They both contracted,
but only daughter
took delivery. Speaking--

11:47.107 --> 11:48.707
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.942
What do you mean
only the daughter
took delivery?

11:50.944 --> 11:53.945
The mother forgot
her driver's license. What?

11:53.947 --> 11:56.314
Since when does
somebody not having
their driver's license

11:56.316 --> 11:58.149
stop us from delivering
a car? That's what.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.119
Trust me.
The deal's done.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.120
Closed?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.955
Have I ever
let you down?

12:05.791 --> 12:07.859
Yes.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.162
See you
in the conference room.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.263
Christian:
Yeah.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.969
Scottie,
you look like shit.

12:17.971 --> 12:22.040
Yeah, well, try working
four back-to-back weeks
of 17-hour days.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.142
17? Those half-days?

12:24.144 --> 12:26.044
Yeah, and then after
locking up at 1:00 A.M.,

12:26.046 --> 12:27.979
I got
to spend six hours
in the hospital.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.380
No shit?
He as ugly as you?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.482
I don't know yet.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.417
She was still in labor
when I left.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.285
What? Why are
you still here?

12:34.287 --> 12:36.421
'Cause I gotta recap
yesterday's deals.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.256
That's something
Boyd could have done.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.358
My deals,
my responsibility.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.026
Plus I ran into
your old man.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.294
And?
And he said

12:43.296 --> 12:45.463
I can't leave
until she gets closer

12:45.465 --> 12:47.198
or the hospital
pages me.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.367
All right, I'll talk to him.
Yeah, good luck with that.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.305
What the fuck?
Does nobody hear pages
around here?

12:54.307 --> 12:57.208
Hello! All associates
to the conference room,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.410
please, immediately!
Now!

13:00.846 --> 13:02.046
Fuck.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.183
1:00 A.M., huh?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.417
I'm gonna
go ahead and assume

13:06.419 --> 13:08.186
that the lack of stars
on the board

13:08.188 --> 13:09.854
is an indicator
that you were busy,

13:09.856 --> 13:12.791
because that looks
exactly like I left it
last night.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.859
Tell me
where we actually
finished, Scott.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.494
Not so good.
Yeah, evidently.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.363
Here I am thinking
that my phone
not ringing

13:18.365 --> 13:19.798
and you not
picking up yours

13:19.800 --> 13:21.800
is a sign that you
had a handle on things.

13:21.802 --> 13:25.270
I figured you
had your own little problem
to deal with.

13:26.872 --> 13:29.140
Someone please tell me
where we finished.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.111
Where did
we finish?

13:34.513 --> 13:35.914
11.

13:35.916 --> 13:36.915
What?

13:36.917 --> 13:39.083
11? Wha--

13:39.085 --> 13:40.151
shortly after you left,

13:40.153 --> 13:41.586
the wheels
kind of fell off.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.521
I left
three hours early.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.423
You're telling me you
can't handle the store
for three hours?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.325
We made every deal
possible, all right,

13:47.327 --> 13:48.593
probably some
we shouldn't have.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.895
W-wait. Wait. Barrett.
Is this the mother

13:50.897 --> 13:52.197
from Christian's
two-car deal?

13:53.232 --> 13:54.332
Yeah.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.967
She, uh...

13:55.969 --> 13:57.035
Bought
the black limited?

13:58.037 --> 13:59.470
No, she bought
the white one.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.975
Wait. Did I board it
as a black one?

14:03.977 --> 14:06.077
I don't know, but if
this gross is right,

14:06.079 --> 14:07.412
it better have been
a black one.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.613
No, no, no. No.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.448
She--she bought
the white one.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.552
Then why do you
have it boarded
as a $1,000 loser, Scott?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.454
Because those were
the numbers you gave me.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.489
Bullshit! I told you
msrp on the white one

14:18.491 --> 14:20.491
and a grand back
of invoice on the black.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.093
Why would I give her
the same deal

14:22.095 --> 14:24.529
on the last white
special edition model of car,

14:24.531 --> 14:26.197
something that we
consistently sell
for sticker,

14:26.199 --> 14:28.967
as I would a black one
with 6,000 miles on it,
Scott?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.069
We live in Arizona, man!

14:31.071 --> 14:32.370
People drive white cars.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.538
I don't know.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.974
She told me
that you told her

14:35.976 --> 14:37.408
it was
the same price.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.877
I'm sorry.
Which one is it, Scott?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.345
Those were the numbers
i gave you,

14:40.347 --> 14:42.347
or she told you
i told her they were
the same price?

14:42.349 --> 14:44.382
What's the number one rule
in the car business, Scott?

14:46.118 --> 14:47.385
Buyers are liars.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.953
Buyers are liars.
That's right.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.290
Fuck.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.326
Does my dad know?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.662
Reynolds does.
Then he knows.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.565
How long do you think
i can keep him
off your back?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.133
Speaking of Judas,
where is he?

15:02.135 --> 15:03.334
Where do you think?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.370
In throwing you
under the bus as usual.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.472
Fuck. It's morning,
and I'm already
fading heat.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.574
Look, I'm sorry.
We were down 12 cars,

15:09.576 --> 15:12.043
and it was late.
We were having
a shitty day.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.278
Oh, and this deal
bettered it somehow?

15:15.014 --> 15:18.049
What's going on
with you, man?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.584
These mistakes,
they're becoming habitual.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.219
Look, I fucked up, okay?

15:21.221 --> 15:22.654
If you haven't
noticed lately, mark,

15:22.656 --> 15:24.455
I'm a little stressed.
Right.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.524
Yeah, because you're
the only one with
fucking problems.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.928
Boyd.
Yes.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.496
You make sure
those cars get reported.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.097
Got it. Hey.
This is Scott.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.465
Did--did I hear right?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.935
These guys aren't
getting paid on Monday?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.236
Don't ask, okay?

15:38.238 --> 15:40.104
Man, holding back their pay
in this climate

15:40.106 --> 15:41.372
is just brutal...
Yeah. I know.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.374
Even for your old man.
I think you know that.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.609
I'm on it.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.378
Hey, do you want me
to start the meeting,

15:47.380 --> 15:49.080
put on a training video?

15:49.082 --> 15:51.215
I don't know, Scott.
You think you can
handle that?

15:59.425 --> 16:01.392
How does it all look, Steve?

16:01.394 --> 16:03.061
Think it's great.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.629
You know,
you're tracking along
really fine.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.464
One thing I did need
to ask you, though,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.633
you did get the letter
of intent from Detroit
yesterday, right?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.703
I did. Got it right here
on my desk.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.438
Fantastic.
All we need now

16:13.440 --> 16:15.473
is confirmation
from your bank

16:15.475 --> 16:18.109
that the $300,000
will hit the escrow
on Monday,

16:18.111 --> 16:20.278
and you will be
scottsdale's new
franchise dealer.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.680
No problem. We'll have it
over to you Monday morning.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.515
Excellent. I did
have a chance to review

16:24.517 --> 16:26.084
your retail
delivery reports.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.753
Give mark a pat
on the back for me.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.622
He's really done
a superb job down there.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.391
And, uh...

16:33.393 --> 16:35.326
Will do.
Will do, Steve.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.728
Excellent.
All right,
Mr. Chamberlain.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.596
I guess I will talk
to you on Monday.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.630
Sounds good.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.766
So we're good?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.634
If you hold payroll
like I told you.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.403
Little over 150 grand,
just like you said.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.771
Then we're good.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.406
What about
the other 150?

16:49.441 --> 16:51.075
Handled.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.011
I'm wholesaling cars
to Ahmad this afternoon.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.345
Ahmad?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.347
You sure you
want to do business
with Ahmad?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.149
I mean, he's nothing
like his old man.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.084
Yeah, well...

17:01.787 --> 17:04.388
What son is?
Morning.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.523
Don't fucking
morning me.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.094
I just spent
the last 15 minutes

17:10.096 --> 17:12.096
kissing Steve's ass,
our dealer rep.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.733
He had the latest
retail delivery report
thrown in his face

17:15.734 --> 17:19.369
showing that we
are getting our asses
handed to us.

17:22.174 --> 17:25.209
Not only is he
fully unimpressed
by the job you're doing,

17:25.211 --> 17:28.246
he tells me
that if we can't run
this store properly,

17:28.248 --> 17:30.314
he's not sure
we can run another one.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.483
We had a bad night.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.518
A bad night?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.153
On the second
to the last day

17:35.155 --> 17:38.423
of an already
shitty month,
you come out early,

17:38.425 --> 17:39.757
leaving the nuts
to run the asylum,

17:39.759 --> 17:40.792
and we close
with 11?

17:43.495 --> 17:46.297
Yes, sir, 11.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.406
Look, dad,
i had to get home,
all right?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.375
Ashley is threatening
to leave me. I had no--

17:57.377 --> 17:59.610
apparently you're
confusing me with
someone who gives a shit.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.479
That's your
personal business.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.314
Do it on your own time.
Stop wasting mine.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.782
Now what's this I hear

18:04.784 --> 18:07.485
about your manager
giving away my cars,

18:07.487 --> 18:10.221
a white SUV
in a two-car deal?

18:10.223 --> 18:12.090
I'm confused
as to why Scott

18:12.092 --> 18:13.558
doesn't know
that his job here

18:13.560 --> 18:15.293
is to make me money,
not to lose it.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.161
He knows it was a mistake.

18:17.163 --> 18:19.530
A mistake?!

18:19.532 --> 18:22.200
Why is it when employees
fuck with my money,
it's a mistake,

18:22.202 --> 18:23.768
but when i
fuck with theirs,
it's stealing.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.536
Which begs the question,

18:25.538 --> 18:28.606
why is there
another voucher
signed by you

18:28.608 --> 18:30.341
for $5,000 on my desk?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.143
It's the spiff money
for the weekend.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.679
I already paid out
$10,000 in spiff money
this month.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.681
How much spiff money
do you need?

18:36.683 --> 18:37.882
They're not getting
their paychecks on Monday.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.217
And...

18:39.219 --> 18:41.452
And they got
their dicks in the dirt.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.820
They'll live.
"They'll live"?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.389
80% of these guys live
paycheck to paycheck.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.625
Well, then maybe
they'd better learn
to manage their money.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.193
Oh, yeah? How do you
manage something

18:49.195 --> 18:50.561
you never had in the fucking
first place, Reynolds?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.330
Hey, I don't care
how they live!

18:53.432 --> 18:54.699
In case
you've forgotten,

18:54.701 --> 18:56.901
we need $300,000
in closing costs

18:56.903 --> 18:58.236
for a certain
new dealership,

18:58.238 --> 18:59.737
so if these guys
have a problem

18:59.739 --> 19:01.539
not receiving
their paychecks
for three or four days,

19:01.541 --> 19:04.242
you can fire
their fucking asses.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.412
And now that we've
touched on firing,

19:08.414 --> 19:10.715
now is as good
a time as any.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.316
You should start
with Scott.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.553
Well,
you said it yourself.
Scott made a mistake.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.356
Only, this one's
a career changer.

19:20.526 --> 19:21.792
He's having a baby.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.864
Well, then he'll
have plenty of time

19:26.866 --> 19:28.699
to spend with him,
won't he?

19:30.536 --> 19:32.937
What? You don't
like the way
i run the store?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.672
It's not how
I'd run the new one.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.673
Oh, really?

19:36.708 --> 19:38.342
You know,
you said that

19:38.344 --> 19:40.278
as if you think
you're really
going to get it.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.516
Is that not
what we discussed?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.617
Shit, you can't even
run this one--

19:46.619 --> 19:47.919
no one fucking
asked you, Reynolds!

19:47.921 --> 19:50.454
No, it's
a valid point.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.591
I'm beginning
to wonder if you're
really ready.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.494
If I could actually
give you the reins
to a brand-new store

19:56.496 --> 19:57.662
with double
the workforce,

19:57.664 --> 19:59.263
could you
handle it properly?

19:59.265 --> 20:00.631
Is that really
your concern?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.400
What, you think
it's different?

20:02.402 --> 20:06.871
Hey, son, if you
had the sand
to think it,

20:06.873 --> 20:10.641
then by all means,
say it.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.745
Do you think you
have what it takes
to be a dealer?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.615
Huh, chief,
to be an owner?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.417
Is that a trick question?

20:19.419 --> 20:20.851
No.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.753
Then, yeah, absolutely.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.923
Good, because today
we're going to find out.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.293
Mark, you hit 300,
retail,

20:29.295 --> 20:30.828
sold and reported
by 5:00,

20:30.830 --> 20:33.531
and put a bullet
in Scott's head,

20:33.533 --> 20:35.433
then that new dealership
is yours.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.934
You don't,

20:36.936 --> 20:39.870
and you get
what you see when you
close your eyes.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.474
What about the checks?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.509
What about them?
What do I tell them?

20:45.511 --> 20:48.479
Tell them?
You still don't get it,
do you, mark?

20:48.481 --> 20:51.582
Oh, that's right.
That's not what
you would do

20:51.584 --> 20:53.551
if you ran
the new dealership.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.952
But if I were you,

20:54.954 --> 20:56.921
I would tell them
whatever I needed
to tell them

20:56.923 --> 20:58.522
to hit
300 fucking cars.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.591
Tell them
the check machine
ran out of ink.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.892
Tell them
you ran out of checks.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.395
Tell them
a fucking bedtime story.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.931
I don't give a shit!

21:06.933 --> 21:10.801
But I suggest
that you stop coddling
these guys.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.270
Get tough.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.672
Get eight inches deep
up someone's ass.

21:14.674 --> 21:15.973
Whatever it takes.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.009
Because believe me, son,

21:18.011 --> 21:19.777
if you can't or won't,

21:19.779 --> 21:22.046
I can assure you...

21:23.049 --> 21:25.750
I will find someone...

21:25.752 --> 21:28.753
Who can and will.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.869
Get past it.
Get past it.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.604
Get past--
in the hole!

21:47.840 --> 21:48.839
Shunk.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.710
He wishes. Hey.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.545
It's daddy's deal.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.880
Everybody, listen up.
Everybody, listen up.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.348
What's up?

21:57.350 --> 21:58.983
Hey, tell 'em what
you did last night.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.785
I got a ride

22:00.787 --> 22:02.453
in Rex Chapman's
El camino.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.955
And he's coming
down here today
to buy a car.

22:04.957 --> 22:08.726
And, Christian,
if I see you even walk
towards him a step...

22:08.728 --> 22:09.927
Uh-oh.
Wait a minute.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.896
Who do you think
sold him the El camino?

22:11.898 --> 22:13.331
Ohh!
He's already his customer.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.899
1972?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.834
All right. All right.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.868
Hey, Quinn.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.405
Quinn. Quinn.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.707
How 'bout some coffee?

22:22.709 --> 22:24.475
Sam worthington.

22:24.477 --> 22:27.411
Hey, uh, green pea,
green pea,

22:27.413 --> 22:28.779
pass me the coffee.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.748
Pass him
the coffee.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.116
I--it's right
in front of--

22:32.118 --> 22:34.385
pass me the coffee,
green pea.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.386
I'm getting tired over here.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.754
Okay,
I'm passing you--

22:36.756 --> 22:39.724
Caleb:
Put that coffee down.

22:43.061 --> 22:44.729
Uh...

22:44.731 --> 22:46.430
Coffee's for closers only.

22:46.432 --> 22:48.833
You think
I'm fucking with you?

22:48.835 --> 22:51.902
No.
I'm not fucking with you.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.038
I'm here from downtown.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.474
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray,

22:56.476 --> 22:59.076
and I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.679
Your name's levine?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.714
Yep.
Yep.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.950
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

23:05.952 --> 23:08.486
All: I don't gotta
listen to this shit!

23:08.488 --> 23:10.020
You certainly don't, pal,

23:10.022 --> 23:12.056
'cause the good news
is you're fired.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.459
The bad news is
you've got--

23:15.461 --> 23:18.095
you've all got
just one week
to regain your jobs,

23:18.097 --> 23:20.831
starting with tonight,
starting with tonight's sit.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.133
Si...

23:22.135 --> 23:25.069
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

23:26.838 --> 23:28.639
Yeah.
Yeah.

23:32.978 --> 23:35.012
Whoo!
My man.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.781
So is that from a movie
or something?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.682
You've never
seen "glengarry"?

23:38.684 --> 23:40.684
Nah. They don't show
that shit on nickelodeon.
That's why.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.020
This
an "icarly" guy?

23:43.022 --> 23:44.922
...couldn't sell him
a basketball.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.024
Well, I'm gonna get
an autographed basketball
when he leaves,

23:47.026 --> 23:49.527
and I'll put it in my office
for all you motherfuckers.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.795
Oh, you have
an office now?

23:50.797 --> 23:52.062
"Spongebob."
For all you motherfuckers.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.063
I'm taking yours.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.598
Boyd, where's Scott?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.767
He's outside talking
to the hospital.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.135
Great training video.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.203
It was fun.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.671
All right, everybody,
listen up.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.672
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.606
Boyd, is everyone here?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.108
Everyone but Reynolds.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.810
Dick.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.645
Oh, man.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.613
Hey, boss, forgive me,
but regarding our paychecks?

24:09.615 --> 24:12.183
Yes, I know,
and believe me when I tell you

24:12.185 --> 24:14.452
my old man and I are
just as upset as you are.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.719
So let me explain.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.492
Actually, no. First of all,

24:21.494 --> 24:23.828
let me just say thank you

24:23.830 --> 24:26.130
to each
and every one of you

24:26.132 --> 24:28.199
for all the extra work
you've put in this year.

24:28.201 --> 24:29.934
I know it's been
a tough one,

24:29.936 --> 24:32.036
and I know that some of you
have been struggling,

24:32.038 --> 24:35.739
and I just want you to know
that that hasn't gone unnoticed.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.176
So as you all know,
we have been competing

24:39.178 --> 24:41.212
in hopes of earning
the manufacturer's favor

24:41.214 --> 24:43.047
for the new store
in the east valley,

24:43.049 --> 24:44.615
but what you might not know

24:44.617 --> 24:46.584
is that last week,
we were chosen

24:46.586 --> 24:48.519
to be one of the finalists.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.221
All right.
Yes.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.157
Which resulted in Detroit

24:53.159 --> 24:54.992
sending us some
new payroll software,

24:54.994 --> 24:57.628
in the hopes that by the time
the new store is awarded,

24:57.630 --> 24:59.196
we would have had
the bugs worked out.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.066
Now, clearly
that has not happened,

25:02.068 --> 25:06.770
so I went to my old man,
and I convinced him to
manually cut your checks,

25:06.772 --> 25:08.539
so in addition to the $5,000

25:08.541 --> 25:11.275
in spiff money I have
for you guys this weekend,

25:11.277 --> 25:12.743
I can also guarantee

25:12.745 --> 25:15.813
that you will be paid
on Monday.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.748
My man.
All right.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.251
Whoo!

25:20.253 --> 25:22.686
Forgive me for
not joining in
the festivities,

25:22.688 --> 25:26.257
but it's not like we
haven't heard this before,
and quite frankly,

25:26.259 --> 25:28.526
it's always turned out
to be a load of horseshit.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.227
Yeah, seriously, boss.
Yeah, well, guess what.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.595
I'm not Reynolds.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.731
Clearly, but,
uh, why don't you

25:33.733 --> 25:35.132
tell 'em
the catch, boss?

25:35.134 --> 25:36.901
What the fuck,
Reynolds?

25:36.903 --> 25:38.202
Just hang on, everybody.
Calm down.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.270
Fuck! See?
Here's the horseshit.

25:39.272 --> 25:40.838
Hey, Max,
how many fucking cars

25:40.840 --> 25:42.940
do you have out
for the month,
anyway? Four?

25:42.942 --> 25:44.308
You think you're even
getting a check?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.544
Shit, if I were you,
I'd be more concerned

25:46.546 --> 25:48.212
about getting
my walking papers
than a check.

25:52.817 --> 25:54.718
What's the catch?

25:57.188 --> 25:58.622
300 cars.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.091
By when?

26:01.093 --> 26:02.326
5:00 P.M. today.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.028
And where are we now?

26:05.964 --> 26:07.698
265.
Pbbt.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.199
35 cars in eight hours?

26:09.201 --> 26:11.201
I mean, I don't want
to piss on the fire
with Max,

26:11.203 --> 26:12.570
but this isn't
exactly 2007.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.071
I mean, what do you
think the odds are

26:14.073 --> 26:15.940
of accomplishing that
when our best day

26:15.942 --> 26:17.308
in the last five years
has been 20?

26:17.310 --> 26:19.009
Well, I don't know.
How many cars do you

26:19.011 --> 26:20.077
have out this month,
Christian?

26:20.079 --> 26:21.946
26.
Okay.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.981
And I'm sorry.
Just refresh my memory.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.082
What's
your bonus payout,

26:25.084 --> 26:27.585
just roughly,
on those 26 cars?

26:27.587 --> 26:31.655
Uh, roughly $4,373.23.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.791
Roughly.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.960
So what do you stand
to make if you hit 30?

26:35.962 --> 26:38.762
30-unit bonus,
an additional
five or six grand.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.164
Whew.
Wow.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.899
Yeah.
Yeah.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.702
I would say the chances
are pretty good.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.637
'Cause with
the exception
of a few of you,

26:46.639 --> 26:48.238
Christian's
not the only one
in this room

26:48.240 --> 26:50.641
with a seat
at that table,
so the way I see it,

26:50.643 --> 26:53.344
hitting 300
is the only option.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.816
So what does that mean?

26:58.818 --> 27:01.151
It means that today,

27:01.153 --> 27:04.788
every single person
that steps foot on this lot

27:04.790 --> 27:08.692
is a stone-cold buyer,

27:08.694 --> 27:10.728
without exception.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.996
What does that mean?

27:11.998 --> 27:13.097
It means that they're
properly greeted.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.231
Hello,
Mr. and Mrs. customer.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.933
Welcome to
the Chamberlain auto team.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.636
My name is mark.
How can I help you today?

27:18.638 --> 27:20.938
You take control
of that deal from the start,

27:20.940 --> 27:22.740
doing all
of those little things

27:22.742 --> 27:25.009
that that Jack-off
at the store they just left

27:25.011 --> 27:28.245
didn't do. I'm talking
about prequalifying them,

27:28.247 --> 27:30.214
landing them
on the right vehicle,

27:30.216 --> 27:31.915
giving them
the proper walk-around.

27:31.917 --> 27:34.752
You go with them
on the test drive.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.353
Assumptive closing
the whole way.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.722
So, Mr. and Mrs. customer,

27:38.724 --> 27:42.126
where do you plan on taking
that first vacation
in your new vehicle?

27:42.128 --> 27:44.762
They answer you, it means
they're taking ownership.

27:44.764 --> 27:47.798
You assumptive close
when you get back to the lot

27:47.800 --> 27:50.100
by having them park that car
in the sold row.

27:50.102 --> 27:53.103
They do, they're taking
ownership again.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.105
Then you bring them inside,
you sit them down,

27:55.107 --> 27:57.141
and you get them something
to eat and drink.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.710
Now, quick, $250 cash in fist
right now

27:59.712 --> 28:01.912
to the first person
who can tell me

28:01.914 --> 28:03.681
why we provide
free hot dogs and sodas.

28:03.683 --> 28:07.051
And, no, before you say it,
it's not to keep your asses fat.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.053
Hey, Brady,
I'm talking to you, pal.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.756
Quinn, now. Go.

28:12.758 --> 28:14.291
Uh, because
after you've eaten,

28:14.293 --> 28:16.293
you're always tired
and less combative.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.695
And...

28:17.697 --> 28:19.329
And when you're
given some for free,

28:19.331 --> 28:21.198
you feel
more obligated
to listen.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.033
Bingo.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.403
So, last, but not least,

28:26.405 --> 28:29.840
it means that you get
those three cs,

28:29.842 --> 28:32.376
credit app, cash,
and commitment.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.812
You ask for that sale.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.780
You don't leave
a penny on the table,

28:36.782 --> 28:39.049
and no one--
and I mean no one--

28:39.051 --> 28:42.786
leaves this store with
fewer than three people
talking to them.

28:42.788 --> 28:44.955
I don't care if you're having
a problem with the customer.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.191
You turn them,
because half of something

28:47.193 --> 28:48.258
is better than...

28:48.260 --> 28:49.927
All of nothing!
All of nothing!

28:49.929 --> 28:51.161
Now, do you understand me?!

28:51.163 --> 28:52.229
Yes!
Yes!
Come on!

28:52.231 --> 28:54.198
I said,
"do you understand me?!"

28:54.200 --> 28:55.833
Yes!
Yes!

28:55.835 --> 28:58.001
Let's get fired up and go
sell some fucking cars!

28:58.003 --> 28:59.403
Let's do this,
boss man.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.938
Nice one.
Let's go, guys. Come on.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.773
Boyd: Bam. Bam.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.208
Go get 'em.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.809
Come on.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.077
Let's go, griggs.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.345
Let's get to it.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.882
Not bad, knute rockne.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.784
Thanks.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.753
Let's sell some cars,
right?

29:15.755 --> 29:17.154
Mm-hmm.
All right.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.422
Let's go, griggs!

29:18.424 --> 29:20.324
Let's sell some cars!
Whoo!

29:40.545 --> 29:42.112
This is the 4-square,

29:42.114 --> 29:43.447
where the negotiating
begins.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.016
Remember the number one rule
in the car business.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.552
You sell on your feet.
You negotiate in your seat.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.387
By the time
the customer sits,

29:50.389 --> 29:52.289
the question isn't
whether or not
they're buying,

29:52.291 --> 29:54.291
but how do they plan
on paying for it,

29:54.293 --> 29:56.426
and more importantly,
how much money are
we gonna make?

29:56.428 --> 29:57.561
Max: You shitting me?

29:57.563 --> 29:59.797
Don't look at me
like that, Max.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.799
Come on. You know
on the first pencil,

30:01.801 --> 30:03.967
you gotta scrape 'em
off the ceiling.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.969
655.
Go make the deal, man.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.806
Boyd, what office?

30:08.808 --> 30:10.007
64-03.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.845
...sure. Call and
negotiate if you want,
but come on.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.414
You know he's up there
plotting with his manager,
just trying to...

30:17.416 --> 30:19.516
There's not
a customer on the planet

30:19.518 --> 30:22.352
that won't tell you
the same thing. "Fucking hate
the negotiation process.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.488
"Why do you have to keep
going back and forth,
checking with your manager?

30:24.490 --> 30:27.357
Why can't you just give me
the bottom-line price
right off the bat?"

30:27.359 --> 30:29.226
'Cause, green pea, listen,

30:29.228 --> 30:31.595
if it truly was
the bottom-line price
i was giving them,

30:31.597 --> 30:33.897
they would still feel
like they were
getting fucked.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.233
Because of
the number one rule
in the car business.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.167
Sell on your feet.
Negotiate in your seat.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.541
The customer always
has to feel like he won,

30:44.543 --> 30:46.844
like he got himself
a good deal.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.479
It's one of the main reasons
why we negotiate.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.315
And trust me,
he wants nothing more

30:51.317 --> 30:53.250
than to walk
in the office on Monday

30:53.252 --> 30:55.485
and say, "those cocksuckers
didn't get over on me.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.221
I got over on them."

30:59.090 --> 31:00.991
Wow, man, you gotta
be kidding me.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.960
Really? 665 a month?

31:02.962 --> 31:05.195
Come on. Are you trying
to screw me up the--

31:05.197 --> 31:07.865
now, another reason
we negotiate

31:07.867 --> 31:10.901
is we can pencil in high
on the first round of numbers,

31:10.903 --> 31:12.135
because you never know.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.071
You might get lucky,
step on your own dick,

31:14.073 --> 31:16.573
and find the guy
who's willing to pay it

31:16.575 --> 31:18.275
because of
the number one rule.

31:20.945 --> 31:23.046
The customer
always want to feel
like they won.

31:24.082 --> 31:25.315
Sit on--
sell on your feet.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.383
Negotiate
in your seat.

31:30.154 --> 31:32.656
You can always go down
in price, green pea,

31:32.658 --> 31:35.158
but you can never,
ever go back up.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.230
You know there's three
number-one rules, right?

31:42.066 --> 31:43.901
Mr. Stephens, I can
fully appreciate that.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.535
I'm looking
at the ad myself,
but you're comparing...

31:45.537 --> 31:47.170
...apples
to oranges,
Mr. brenner.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.405
If you're
looking at price,
that's fine,

31:48.407 --> 31:49.640
but I gotta
warn you...

31:49.642 --> 31:51.441
It's a widely known fact,
Mrs. brown,

31:51.443 --> 31:54.077
that nice cars aren't cheap,
and cheap cars aren't nice.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.446
Sheri, I am sorry.
I am not showing

31:56.448 --> 31:59.149
any dark graphite
metallic four-doors
in stock.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.084
Sure. I would be happy
to check for you.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.086
Uh, can you call back
in, say, 10 minutes?

32:03.088 --> 32:06.056
What the fuck
are you doing?
Put her on hold.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.293
Sheri, can you,
uh, hold for
a second, please?

32:09.295 --> 32:11.461
Get the fuck up. Go.
Get the...

32:12.497 --> 32:14.498
You wanna slit
your own throat,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.034
it's best done
with a knife.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.468
Hey, sheri.
Mike Chamberlain here.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.569
I'm one of the owners.

32:19.571 --> 32:22.306
I apologize,
but Ryan here is new,

32:22.308 --> 32:25.309
and, uh, he was
mistakenly looking at
an old inventory sheet.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.477
If you'll
give me a second
to get the new one,

32:27.479 --> 32:29.947
I think we might
just have the car
you're looking for.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.014
Excellent.
I'll be right back.

32:31.016 --> 32:33.383
I mean, what the fuck?

32:33.385 --> 32:36.720
Our biggest day, and i
still gotta spoon-feed
you nimrods.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.389
You are weaker
than surface lemonade.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.124
Hey, I'm back.
Sorry 'bout that.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.392
Now let me check here.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.127
Ah, you know what?

32:44.129 --> 32:45.629
We do have one.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.398
We have a dark graphite
metallic four-door
in stock.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.335
Actually it looks like
it was just dropped off
this morning.

32:51.337 --> 32:54.738
No kidding?
I'm the only dealership
in the city with one?

32:54.740 --> 32:56.673
Wow. That doesn't
surprise me, sheri,

32:56.675 --> 32:59.042
as I do have
the largest inventory
in the state.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.510
What time would you
like to get here?

33:00.512 --> 33:02.179
1:00.
1:00 would be great.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.246
Yeah,
that sounds perfect.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.615
When you get here,
just ask for Ryan,

33:05.617 --> 33:09.152
and I will personally
see to it that he takes
excellent care of you.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.454
All right, sheri.
Wonderful. Okay.

33:10.456 --> 33:11.722
See you then. Bye-bye.

33:13.124 --> 33:14.124
Now log it.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.759
So we do have
the car?

33:15.761 --> 33:17.361
Yep,
but something tells me

33:17.363 --> 33:19.463
it's gonna sell
before she gets here.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.100
Dick.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.736
I call to verify
any one of those
and its shit,

33:25.738 --> 33:28.338
your first deal
of the day is half.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.706
Hey, Boyd,
have you seen Scott?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.475
He's out back
stocking in his trades.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.477
All right, have him
find me when he's back.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.645
Hey, wait a minute.
Am I missing something
here, man?

33:35.647 --> 33:38.181
'Cause I can't
help but feel like
I'm late for the prom.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.250
No.
You sure about that?

33:40.252 --> 33:41.551
Yep.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.620
Available sales
to the showroom, please.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.356
As I explained
to this nice young man,

33:46.358 --> 33:49.026
and having recently lost
my Edward,

33:49.028 --> 33:52.462
I've had to do
a lot of things
on my own lately.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.198
Oh, I am so sorry, Ann.
I can only imagine.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.802
Yes. And being
a woman of faith,

33:58.804 --> 34:00.470
a never make
a decision

34:00.472 --> 34:02.305
without having
prayed on it first.

34:02.307 --> 34:05.175
Well, believe me,
Ann, I can more than
appreciate that,

34:05.177 --> 34:06.610
having been raised
catholic myself.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.713
I can't recall a decision,
be it big or small,

34:09.715 --> 34:11.047
that my mother
didn't pray about.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.049
Oh.

34:12.051 --> 34:14.317
Rest her soul.
Oh.

34:14.319 --> 34:17.087
Do you attend
our lady of
perpetual help?

34:17.089 --> 34:18.455
I do.
Oh.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.589
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.391
Oh, no, Ann, don't be.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.827
In this business,
we often have to work
on Sundays,

34:23.829 --> 34:27.563
so I don't make it to mass
near as much as I'd like.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.132
I can understand that.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.268
Thank you. Which...

34:31.270 --> 34:34.103
You know, now that i
think about it, um,

34:34.106 --> 34:37.139
if it wouldn't be
too presumptuous
and if you wouldn't mind,

34:37.141 --> 34:39.176
I'd really like to pray
with you about this.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.243
Oh, really?

34:40.245 --> 34:41.478
Good lord knows
i could use it.

34:43.214 --> 34:45.681
Well, Mr. Chamberlain...

34:49.353 --> 34:50.786
Well,
that would be nice.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.322
Thank you.
Care to join us, George?

34:55.359 --> 34:56.860
Uh, sure.

35:01.132 --> 35:02.265
Dear heavenly father,

35:02.267 --> 35:05.102
my savior, my lord,
and my redeemer,

35:05.104 --> 35:06.803
once again,
i call upon thee.

35:06.805 --> 35:10.407
Tell me what to do,
and thy will be done
in this transaction.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.476
Amen.
Amen.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.678
Amen.
Heh.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.413
And look at all
the room in the back.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.848
You're a catholic?

35:17.850 --> 35:19.749
You know
the last three words
in the Bible, George?

35:19.751 --> 35:21.118
"Get the money."

35:21.120 --> 35:23.687
Now you help a customer
and close it,

35:23.689 --> 35:25.288
that deal's
entirely yours.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.558
Now, you help a customer
and someone else closes it,

35:28.560 --> 35:30.494
they get half.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.362
And spiffs?

35:32.364 --> 35:34.131
Oh, spiffs are easy.
That's all cash in fist.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.367
First deal of the day
pays 200, as does the last.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.302
Now, hat trick,
that's three cars sold
in the same day,

35:39.304 --> 35:40.570
that's 300.

35:40.572 --> 35:43.173
But the <i>pièce</i>
<i>de résistance--</i>

35:43.175 --> 35:44.908
heh--trunking someone,

35:44.910 --> 35:46.409
that's 100.

35:46.411 --> 35:47.477
Trunking someone?

35:47.479 --> 35:48.912
Ah, if we're lucky.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.515
Now, the three
most important things

35:51.517 --> 35:52.916
that you'll learn
in this business--

35:52.918 --> 35:53.917
the number one rules.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.186
Okay.

35:57.388 --> 35:58.421
Circle jerks...

35:58.423 --> 35:59.890
Like that one...

35:59.892 --> 36:01.825
Are the reason
why 5% of the guys

36:01.827 --> 36:03.527
in this business
make 95% of the money.

36:03.529 --> 36:06.363
They are a cancer,
so stay out of 'em.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.566
Second, the only person
who cares about your success
here more than you is me,

36:09.568 --> 36:11.601
and I mean that.
And last, but not least

36:11.603 --> 36:14.271
is the story
of the lion and the gazelle.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.208
Every morning in Africa,

36:18.210 --> 36:20.810
gazelle wakes up and knows
it will have to outrun
the fastest lion,

36:20.812 --> 36:21.845
or it will be killed.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.614
And every morning
in Africa,

36:24.616 --> 36:26.783
the lion wakes up and knows
it will have to outrun

36:26.785 --> 36:29.352
the slowest gazelle,
or it will starve to death.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.656
So when the sun comes up,
it doesn't matter whether
you're a lion or a gazelle.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.724
You better be running.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.828
But, really, who wants
to be a fucking gazelle?

36:45.403 --> 36:47.971
You stick with me,

36:47.973 --> 36:49.806
I'll make you
a fucking lion.

36:52.276 --> 36:53.910
Coming?
Yes.

36:57.848 --> 36:59.416
I'm a lion.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.550
$60,000 car, $80,000--

37:00.552 --> 37:01.918
it's like,
"pick a car, guy..."

37:01.920 --> 37:04.354
All right, today's
your big day, green pea.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.456
Yeah?
Try not to get mauled.

37:06.458 --> 37:09.259
I don't care what
you guys say. I'm next.
That's the way it is.

37:09.261 --> 37:10.293
You're not next, Caleb.

37:10.295 --> 37:11.728
I am, then Brady,
then Jayson.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.630
Bullshit.
I was out here first.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.999
But then you left,
which means you've
lost your turn.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.400
I'm having
a bad month here,
all right?

37:17.402 --> 37:18.902
Really, dude?
I got bills to pay.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.670
I got mouths to feed,
okay, dude?

37:20.672 --> 37:21.705
You got
mouths to feed?

37:21.707 --> 37:23.473
Seen Brady's fat-ass kid?

37:23.475 --> 37:25.242
I think his two-year-old's
a diabetic already.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.443
That's not cool, man.

37:26.445 --> 37:29.813
So what do you
think of all this?

37:29.815 --> 37:31.381
So far, so good.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.883
I just hope I have
what it takes to be a lion.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.419
Mm, Christian showed you
his paycheck, did he?

37:36.421 --> 37:37.854
Yeah. That's insane.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.323
Hmm. It's also
from 2007.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.425
If I were you,
I'd be careful.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.394
Service, line two, please.
Why's that?

37:44.396 --> 37:46.830
Because lions are
notorious for eating
their young.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.698
Caleb:
That's bullshit.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.401
Since when is grabbing
a bite to eat cause
for losing your turn?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.336
It's not, Caleb,
but going inside is.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.871
Look, if you
were hungry, you should
have just grabbed

37:54.873 --> 37:57.474
a fucking hot dog, guy.
Exactly.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.676
Fuck you guys. You know
that shit's not kosher.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.278
Aww.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.946
Heathens.
Ohh.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.481
So you lost
your turn.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.783
It's not like it
can get any worse.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.385
Then again,
maybe it can.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.957
Money time.
Money time, baby.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.525
Money time.
Children, relax.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.860
You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.028
Oh, yeah?
Why is that, Sharon?

38:18.030 --> 38:22.565
Because that is Edward,
my realtor,

38:22.567 --> 38:23.566
my appointment.

38:23.568 --> 38:25.669
Motherfucker.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.504
Kid.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.385
I suggest
you boys all find
a new profession.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.421
What makes you say that?

38:49.694 --> 38:52.529
'Cause we just got played.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.531
Shit.
Man.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.665
There you go.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.434
Oh, that one's
not for you.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.336
That's for your kids.
You coming?

38:59.338 --> 39:00.637
Yes, sir.

39:10.448 --> 39:12.382
Boyd, Boyd, where's mark?

39:13.617 --> 39:16.553
Boyd, I asked you
a question.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.788
He's busy.
Doing what?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.990
I don't know.
It's not my day
to watch him.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.059
Fellas,
where are your ties?

39:23.061 --> 39:24.661
I told 'em
not to wear 'em.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.496
Why? Are you aware
of a change in policy

39:26.498 --> 39:27.731
regarding company attire
that I'm not?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.099
'Cause it's Saturday,
Reynolds.

39:29.101 --> 39:30.500
We wear ties here
every day,

39:30.502 --> 39:31.901
even on Saturdays,
so go get 'em.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.603
They left 'em at home.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.939
Well, maybe they ought
to go home and get 'em.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.642
Come on.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.416
They should be worried
about selling cars

39:46.418 --> 39:48.818
and making money,
Reynolds, not ties.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.387
You might want
to do the same.

39:50.389 --> 39:51.788
Well, maybe you just
better watch yourself.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.390
Or what?
Hey!

39:53.392 --> 39:54.991
Are we having
another problem?

39:54.993 --> 39:56.960
No. No,
no problem at all.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.763
I was just reminding
your boy here

39:59.765 --> 40:02.599
about the, uh, dress code.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.567
And I was just
reminding this tripe

40:04.569 --> 40:06.069
that he better
check himself, mark.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.771
Check myself?

40:10.776 --> 40:13.143
What is this,
amateur night
at the Apollo?

40:13.145 --> 40:15.812
Just better
make sure that
your alligator mouth

40:15.814 --> 40:19.916
isn't writing checks
that your lizard ass
can't cash, Boyd,

40:19.918 --> 40:23.186
or you just might
find yourself in
the unemployment line...

40:23.188 --> 40:24.788
With Scott.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.123
I'm this close,
mark.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.426
To what?

40:29.428 --> 40:30.760
When I get
this new dealership,

40:30.762 --> 40:32.562
you're gonna be
my general sales manager.

40:32.564 --> 40:33.997
Do you really
wanna jeopardize that

40:33.999 --> 40:35.832
over some fucking
neanderthal in a pinstripe?

40:36.934 --> 40:38.802
Just focus
on selling 300 cars.

40:38.804 --> 40:41.004
I'll take care of him.
And that shit about Scott?

40:43.841 --> 40:46.810
What? He's talking
out of his ass.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.112
300 cars, Boyd.

40:51.081 --> 40:52.449
That'd be too funny.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.983
If you're not
coming in here

40:53.985 --> 40:56.186
to work a deal or
log an appointment,
get the fuck out.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.993
Thanks.
Hey, mark.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.562
Take care of Scott yet?

41:07.998 --> 41:10.633
Look, man,
sometimes the best thing

41:10.635 --> 41:12.836
you can do for a guy
is fire him.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.771
Some people have
no business doing this,

41:14.773 --> 41:15.972
and oftentimes
a little push

41:15.974 --> 41:17.740
is all it takes
for them to realize it.

41:17.742 --> 41:19.242
You really are
a piece of shit, Reynolds.

41:19.244 --> 41:20.677
I'm a piece of shit?

41:20.679 --> 41:22.011
I mean, correct me
if I'm wrong, mark,

41:22.013 --> 41:23.546
but you're the one
about to fire him.

41:23.548 --> 41:24.881
Yeah, because you
threw him under the bus.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.916
No, because
just like me,

41:26.918 --> 41:29.619
you know it's
what you have to do
to get what you want.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.656
I am nothing like you.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.925
Oh, you got that right.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.261
You see, mark,
some of us have
to fight.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.997
We can't all be members
of the lucky sperm club,
mark.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.499
Fuck you.
Heh heh.

41:42.501 --> 41:44.901
I am where I am
because I busted my ass,

41:44.903 --> 41:48.137
unlike some people
who get to just back-stab
their way to the middle.

41:48.139 --> 41:49.873
Don't kid yourself.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.242
You are where you are
because you got a phd,

41:52.244 --> 41:53.576
papa has a dealership,

41:53.578 --> 41:55.211
and for no other reason
than that.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.714
He doesn't have
this place, and
you're nothing, mark,

41:57.716 --> 41:59.148
just another
old car dog.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.184
Oh, Boyd said
you wanted to see me.

42:02.219 --> 42:04.254
Yeah.
Everything okay?

42:04.256 --> 42:05.255
Yeah.

42:11.762 --> 42:13.730
Scott:
Fucking Reynolds.

42:20.804 --> 42:22.772
Look, Scott, i--
i know you're pissed.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.641
Fucking-a, I'm pissed!

42:26.277 --> 42:28.278
I'm devastated.

42:28.280 --> 42:33.716
I have done everything
ever asked of me at this place.

42:39.591 --> 42:43.326
Forgive me if i
envisioned maybe a fucking
parting watch or something.

42:51.635 --> 42:53.670
Well, I...

43:05.749 --> 43:07.951
I don't know
what to say, okay?

43:07.953 --> 43:10.086
I need this job, mark.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.288
Yeah.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.790
I need this job.

43:15.259 --> 43:18.361
You know how hard it is
out there right now?

43:22.199 --> 43:23.933
I'm having a baby, man.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.134
I'm sorry.

43:27.871 --> 43:29.606
I'm sorry.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.844
This wasn't
my decision. I--

43:34.846 --> 43:36.879
you know, I tried.
I...

43:43.053 --> 43:46.055
Look, I don't know
what you want me
to tell you, Scott.

43:46.057 --> 43:49.092
I want you to tell me
you're gonna try
to do something.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.096
I want you to tell me

43:53.098 --> 43:55.865
that the virtue
of loyalty

43:55.867 --> 44:00.269
still means something
at the giant Chamberlain
auto team.

44:02.641 --> 44:05.074
Tell me
the sins of the father

44:05.076 --> 44:08.711
aren't passed down
from generation to generation.

44:14.084 --> 44:16.052
Reynolds:
Yeah, trust me.

44:16.054 --> 44:19.122
I've got the new store,
and I will be making
a shit-ton more money.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.289
By the way,
what's tripe?

44:20.291 --> 44:22.225
Just so there's
no hard feelings

44:22.227 --> 44:23.393
and you understand
when it happens,

44:23.395 --> 44:25.395
you utter the word
"boy" again,

44:25.397 --> 44:26.696
I'm gonna knock
the fucking taste

44:26.698 --> 44:28.231
out your mouth.
You got that?

44:28.233 --> 44:29.999
Well, that's precisely
what I'm counting on, Boyd.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.135
See, that way, I won't
have to waste the breath

44:32.137 --> 44:33.736
it takes to fire
your black ass.

44:33.738 --> 44:34.904
I'll slap your--

44:34.906 --> 44:37.140
I hope this little
meeting of the minds

44:37.142 --> 44:38.141
is about selling cars,
gentlemen.

44:38.143 --> 44:39.709
Oh, it is.
Boyd and I

44:39.711 --> 44:41.010
were just going over
today's appointments.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.278
Well, good.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.680
When you're through,
Ahmad's here.

44:43.682 --> 44:45.081
I need you
to deal with him.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.883
Oh, we're done
for now.

44:46.885 --> 44:48.284
Boyd, how's the 300
looking, son?

44:48.286 --> 44:51.120
Good. We have a good day
lined up, sir.

44:51.122 --> 44:52.689
Reynolds, I'll meet you
out there.

44:55.693 --> 44:56.793
Attaboy.

45:00.164 --> 45:02.098
Ahmad: Come on, Reynolds.

45:02.100 --> 45:05.134
The book cracks
on this thing for 7,300.

45:05.136 --> 45:08.971
And--
Don't even get me
started on the color.

45:08.973 --> 45:10.139
What the fuck is wrong
with the color?

45:10.141 --> 45:12.008
People like to wear it,
my friend.

45:12.010 --> 45:13.409
They don't like
to drive it.

45:13.411 --> 45:15.044
I'll give you 6,800.

45:15.046 --> 45:17.480
No, Ahmad,
you like to wear it,

45:17.482 --> 45:19.315
and you're killing me.
7,800.

45:19.317 --> 45:20.917
You're killing me.

45:20.919 --> 45:23.252
That, that right here,
too rich.

45:23.254 --> 45:25.288
I'm just
a lowly used-car
wholesaler here.

45:25.290 --> 45:26.422
Help me out.
Mm-hmm.

45:26.424 --> 45:27.790
Too rich, my ass.

45:27.792 --> 45:28.891
Look at your wrist.

45:28.893 --> 45:30.760
It was a gift
from my mother.

45:30.762 --> 45:33.129
Oh, I got a gift
for your mother, actually.

45:33.131 --> 45:34.130
Ahmad.
Hi.

45:34.132 --> 45:35.431
How are you?

45:35.433 --> 45:37.066
Good.
Mr. Chamberlain,
how are things here

45:37.068 --> 45:38.501
at the giant
Chamberlain
auto team, huh?

45:39.504 --> 45:41.070
Oh, I can't complain.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.306
Did you get
your new store yet?

45:43.308 --> 45:44.874
Getting close.
That's funny,

45:44.876 --> 45:46.342
because I was just
over at Phoenix,

45:46.344 --> 45:47.844
and they said
the same thing.

45:47.846 --> 45:49.178
I would expect that.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.246
So where are we?

45:50.248 --> 45:53.182
Uh, nine cars
for 153k.

45:53.184 --> 45:56.352
And Reynolds told you
that we're having

45:56.354 --> 45:57.920
a manufacturer's audit
on Tuesday,

45:57.922 --> 46:00.790
so you can't pick up
the cars until then?

46:00.792 --> 46:02.391
No. No, he didn't.

46:02.393 --> 46:04.127
It's all right.

46:04.129 --> 46:06.796
I don't even have
enough drivers
for today anyway,

46:06.798 --> 46:08.898
so I'll just, uh--
I'll pick 'em up

46:08.900 --> 46:10.032
and pay
for 'em then.

46:11.268 --> 46:14.403
I'm sorry.
Ahmad, forgive me.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.239
How's your dad?

46:17.274 --> 46:18.274
He's good.

46:18.276 --> 46:19.809
He's good.
Thank you.

46:19.811 --> 46:21.811
He should be
up on his feet

46:21.813 --> 46:23.379
and back to work
in no time.

46:23.381 --> 46:24.914
Good.
I'm glad to hear that.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.783
You're still
up on bell road, right?

46:26.785 --> 46:28.050
Yep, still there.

46:28.052 --> 46:30.119
You know, I remember
when your dad came to me

46:30.121 --> 46:32.088
and asked me if he
should buy that place.

46:32.090 --> 46:34.023
Yes, and I'm sure
he's forever grateful

46:34.025 --> 46:36.058
for all the advice
you gave him.

46:36.060 --> 46:37.126
Ah, I'm happy to help.

46:37.128 --> 46:38.427
You know,
must have been tough

46:38.429 --> 46:41.964
when you came here,
Arizona, strange country.

46:41.966 --> 46:43.099
You were this high.

46:43.101 --> 46:44.433
You were washing cars
for your dad.

46:44.435 --> 46:46.235
I was gonna poach you
from him.

46:46.237 --> 46:48.905
Heh. I'll be sure
to let him know.

46:48.907 --> 46:53.342
So what time would i
be able to pick them up
on Tuesday, then, huh?

46:53.344 --> 46:56.813
Actually, Ahmad,
i have to ask a favor.

46:56.815 --> 47:00.917
Um, I'd like you
to pay for the cars today,

47:00.919 --> 47:02.285
but not pick them up
until Tuesday.

47:02.287 --> 47:03.853
It's nothing that your dad
wouldn't do.

47:05.155 --> 47:06.489
I'm confused here
a little.

47:06.491 --> 47:08.424
Are you asking me
for a loan?

47:08.426 --> 47:10.526
No, I'm asking you
for a return of a favor.

47:10.528 --> 47:12.495
A favor?

47:12.497 --> 47:13.963
Mr. Chamberlain,
I'm sorry.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.498
There's a big
difference between,

47:15.500 --> 47:17.266
you know, giving
real-estate advice

47:17.268 --> 47:19.068
and loaning someone
$150,000.

47:19.070 --> 47:20.469
Heh heh. Two days.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.004
A loan, all the same.

47:22.006 --> 47:24.207
And if my father were
here, he would agree.

47:26.577 --> 47:29.946
You know, when your dad
and I first started out,

47:29.948 --> 47:33.482
there was such a thing
as loyalty and allegiance.

47:33.484 --> 47:35.218
It was good for business,

47:35.220 --> 47:37.119
still is.

47:37.121 --> 47:38.321
Oh, yes.

47:38.323 --> 47:40.056
Yes, I hear
loyalty's big

47:40.058 --> 47:41.591
at the Chamberlain
auto team.

47:44.928 --> 47:47.930
Well, if that's the way
you want to play it,

47:47.932 --> 47:51.334
you just go back up
to your place on bell road,

47:51.336 --> 47:56.305
and you tell your dad
that this business
relationship is dead.

47:56.307 --> 47:58.307
You understand, my friend?

48:06.884 --> 48:09.218
What an asshole.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.621
Told you he wasn't
like his old man.

48:11.623 --> 48:13.256
Caleb: They seriously
firing Scott?

48:13.258 --> 48:14.290
Certainly
looks that way.

48:14.292 --> 48:16.225
Who's Scott?

48:16.227 --> 48:17.894
Unbelievable.

48:17.896 --> 48:19.262
Hey, how many times
i gotta tell you?

48:19.264 --> 48:20.263
Go sell cars!

48:20.265 --> 48:22.632
Move!

48:24.102 --> 48:25.902
Hold up. You okay?

48:25.904 --> 48:28.404
Look like you're
about to go ufc
and choke somebody out.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.172
Reynolds.
But believe me,

48:30.174 --> 48:31.607
it's gonna involve
more than choking.

48:31.609 --> 48:33.142
Oh. When it goes down,
make sure I'm around.

48:33.144 --> 48:35.278
This is about Scott,
i take it.

48:35.280 --> 48:37.013
What about him?
Seriously?

48:37.015 --> 48:38.915
Shit, Reynolds been
running his mouth

48:38.917 --> 48:41.250
to all the guys all week
about Scott maybe getting...

48:41.252 --> 48:43.152
You know what?
Fuck him, all right?

48:43.154 --> 48:45.121
He's just talking
out of his ass.

48:45.123 --> 48:48.457
Maybe, but if what
appears to be happening
is actually happening,

48:48.459 --> 48:50.559
he may have it right
this time.

49:27.064 --> 49:29.098
Take a seat.

49:45.615 --> 49:47.316
Is everything all right?

49:47.318 --> 49:50.252
Yeah, I just
need to fill you in
on the new dealership.

49:50.254 --> 49:52.688
So you know that we have
to show the manufacturer

49:52.690 --> 49:55.725
we have $300,000
in escrow,

49:55.727 --> 49:59.128
but we only have 150
from payroll.

49:59.130 --> 50:01.664
Reynolds was supposed
to secure the other 150

50:01.666 --> 50:03.399
through his relationship
with Ahmad.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.735
Ahmad? The guy
who hates Reynolds?
You know that, right?

50:11.108 --> 50:13.009
It was something
that got by me.

50:13.011 --> 50:14.343
I didn't see it coming.

50:20.283 --> 50:22.351
So I need someone
to step up.

50:30.394 --> 50:32.161
Yeah. Okay.

50:32.163 --> 50:33.729
What do you
need me to do?

50:33.731 --> 50:35.364
I need to know
if you know

50:35.366 --> 50:37.500
anyone we can
wholesale cars to,

50:37.502 --> 50:39.335
150 grand worth,

50:39.337 --> 50:41.203
with the understanding

50:41.205 --> 50:42.705
that they
pay for them today

50:42.707 --> 50:44.407
and that they
can't take delivery

50:44.409 --> 50:47.176
until after
the manufacturer's audit
on Tuesday.

50:47.178 --> 50:48.477
Of course.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.113
Do you know anyone?

50:59.623 --> 51:01.424
Yeah.

51:01.426 --> 51:02.725
Yeah,
my buddy Russell.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.260
He'll--he'll be able
to help us out.

51:04.262 --> 51:05.327
Russell?

51:05.329 --> 51:07.463
Yeah, Russell.

51:07.465 --> 51:09.265
You're sure?
I'm sure.

51:10.267 --> 51:11.500
All right.

51:11.502 --> 51:14.370
When he gets back to you,
get back to me.

51:14.372 --> 51:16.639
It's tough
to run a store, mark.

51:16.641 --> 51:18.707
And I hope you
understand the decision

51:18.709 --> 51:21.177
to fire Scott was
purely a business one.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.849
You showed
some steel today.

51:26.851 --> 51:29.318
Maybe you do have
what it takes.

51:39.429 --> 51:41.263
Whoo!

51:41.265 --> 51:42.731
Good job.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.366
You did
a good job.

51:44.368 --> 51:45.367
Good, George.

51:45.369 --> 51:46.368
Hey.

51:54.845 --> 51:56.879
All right, let's go.
Everyone out.

51:56.881 --> 51:58.514
Come on. Let's go.
Get out!

51:58.516 --> 52:00.116
Sell my car
and get my...

52:00.118 --> 52:01.684
Hey, man,
get the fuck out, man!

52:01.686 --> 52:03.385
Did you hear
what I just said?

52:05.355 --> 52:06.622
Are you on that?

52:08.158 --> 52:09.859
I see it. Damn.

52:13.463 --> 52:14.730
Tell me you didn't.

52:20.270 --> 52:22.171
He's having
a baby, mark.

52:22.173 --> 52:24.273
Yeah, I know that.
Thank you.

52:24.275 --> 52:25.441
And you just
gonna cut him loose?

52:25.443 --> 52:28.177
And what would you
suggest I do, Boyd?

52:30.280 --> 52:32.748
I suggest you
telling your father
to go fuck himself.

52:32.750 --> 52:33.849
How 'bout that?

52:33.851 --> 52:35.684
Shit, he might
respect you then.

52:35.686 --> 52:37.486
Well, in theory,
that sounds wonderful, Boyd,

52:37.488 --> 52:39.855
but I'm not here
to win the battle
just to lose the war.

52:39.857 --> 52:41.457
Spare me
with the sun tzu shit.

52:41.459 --> 52:42.658
And what's that
supposed to mean?

52:42.660 --> 52:44.693
It means that
you blew out a guy,

52:44.695 --> 52:46.562
all right,
who's worked
at this store

52:46.564 --> 52:48.230
for the past
20 fucking years.

52:48.232 --> 52:49.665
Are you out
of your mind, mark?

52:54.171 --> 52:55.804
Don't you realize...

52:55.806 --> 52:58.541
That every guy
that works here,
including myself,

52:58.543 --> 53:00.876
would have quit
a long time ago, man,

53:00.878 --> 53:02.845
if they didn't
respect you, okay?

53:02.847 --> 53:04.313
Mark, listen to me!

53:05.348 --> 53:07.583
Mark.

53:07.585 --> 53:10.519
They believe you,

53:10.521 --> 53:11.921
not like
your father,

53:11.923 --> 53:13.789
who they know
don't give a shit
about them,

53:13.791 --> 53:15.658
'cause they know
deep down inside
that you care,

53:15.660 --> 53:17.459
and you go and you
pull this shit.

53:17.461 --> 53:19.628
Bullshit, Boyd!

53:19.630 --> 53:21.797
Most of these guys
are here because we have

53:21.799 --> 53:23.966
the best payment plan
in the city. That's it.

53:23.968 --> 53:26.502
You see
any of them have my back
in this morning's meeting

53:26.504 --> 53:28.537
until I told them
how much money
they stood to make?

53:28.539 --> 53:31.340
Speaking of,
are they actually gonna
get paid on Monday,

53:31.342 --> 53:33.642
or was that just
some more bullshit that
you're saying, mark?

53:33.644 --> 53:36.679
Look, I don't like
how my father runs this place
any more than you do,

53:36.681 --> 53:37.846
but I have
a responsibility--

53:37.848 --> 53:39.481
no, listen to me!
Are they,

53:39.483 --> 53:41.283
or aren't they
gonna get paid, mark?

53:41.285 --> 53:42.518
Don't bullshit me.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.288
Don't fucking
bullshit me.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.760
Unbelievable, mark.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.896
Boyd, listen to me, okay?

53:53.898 --> 53:57.233
If we don't get
to 300 cars by 5:00 P.M. today,

53:57.235 --> 53:59.501
none of it is gonna matter,
anyway, all right?

53:59.503 --> 54:00.736
Because nothing
is gonna change.

54:02.305 --> 54:03.472
Okay.

54:03.474 --> 54:04.473
You're right.

54:04.475 --> 54:05.641
"Okay"?

54:05.643 --> 54:07.009
"Okay"?

54:07.011 --> 54:09.812
What, are you and I not
on the same page anymore?

54:11.581 --> 54:13.482
You know what?

54:13.484 --> 54:15.317
Go fuck yourself,
mark.

54:17.921 --> 54:20.322
Where do you think
you're going?

54:24.361 --> 54:25.461
Look here, mark.

54:25.463 --> 54:27.730
Look, you can lie
to the customer,

54:27.732 --> 54:29.999
and you
can lie to me,

54:30.001 --> 54:31.900
but you can't lie
to yourself, man.

54:31.902 --> 54:33.269
Mm.

54:33.271 --> 54:34.970
And I know you're
up in your head

54:34.972 --> 54:37.606
about your
new car dealership
and changing things,

54:37.608 --> 54:40.009
but the fact is...

54:41.745 --> 54:43.746
You're scared
of your old man,

54:43.748 --> 54:46.715
and that's
the reason
why Scott got fired.

55:11.641 --> 55:13.776
What?
Little problem
just showed up.

55:16.012 --> 55:17.479
Yo, boss.

55:21.051 --> 55:23.786
I need
to speak to the boss
right fucking now!

55:23.788 --> 55:25.321
You're not the owner,
are you? No.

55:25.323 --> 55:26.555
Shut it.
Mark: Excuse me.

55:26.557 --> 55:27.856
Excuse me.
You wanna watch
your mouth?

55:27.858 --> 55:29.458
Who the fuck are you?
I'm the owner.

55:29.460 --> 55:30.959
Oh, that's good.
I want to talk to you.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.395
You know what?
I bought a car here
last night from her.

55:33.397 --> 55:34.530
Yes, you did.
I don't want it.

55:34.532 --> 55:36.065
Well, that makes
two of us.

55:36.067 --> 55:38.500
I know my fucking rights,
so let's not play any games.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.602
No, let's not,
but first things first.

55:40.604 --> 55:43.572
You swear at me again, and i
will throw your fucking ass
right out of my store.

55:43.574 --> 55:45.507
Now, I was
about to go outside

55:45.509 --> 55:47.576
and get a free hot dog
and a coke.

55:47.578 --> 55:49.078
What do you say
you join me?

55:49.080 --> 55:51.046
If the price were right
on this one,

55:51.048 --> 55:53.582
would you be willing
to go colorblind?

55:53.584 --> 55:54.616
Like I told you
on the phone

55:54.618 --> 55:56.085
this morning,
Mr. Chamberlain,

55:56.087 --> 55:58.987
I'm looking
for dark graphite,
not arctic silver.

55:58.989 --> 56:01.056
And I can appreciate
that, sheri, but--

56:01.058 --> 56:03.726
I came to get the car
that I drove for more
than an hour to buy,

56:03.728 --> 56:06.061
a car, quite frankly,
I'm beginning to doubt
that you ever had.

56:06.063 --> 56:08.497
Sheri, I assure you,
it was here.

56:08.499 --> 56:11.066
I mean, I personally
put my hands on it just
moments after we spoke.

56:11.068 --> 56:12.368
Then where is it?

56:12.370 --> 56:14.837
Heh. That's a good question.

56:14.839 --> 56:16.839
Three-day consumer
right of refusal in Arizona

56:16.841 --> 56:18.974
applies only to sales
in which the seller

56:18.976 --> 56:20.676
solicits you
at your place of residence,

56:20.678 --> 56:22.144
and I didn't come
to your home, chief.

56:22.146 --> 56:23.979
You came to mine.

56:23.981 --> 56:26.048
Well, that's
not exactly what
my attorney told me.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.484
Well, then you
should fire him,
'cause he's wrong.

56:28.486 --> 56:29.852
You know, it really
doesn't matter, anyway,

56:29.854 --> 56:32.521
because you have
your own return policy.

56:32.523 --> 56:34.156
Wrong again.

56:34.158 --> 56:35.691
I have
an exchange policy.

56:35.693 --> 56:37.893
Does this look
like Walmart to you?

56:37.895 --> 56:39.695
And the answer may be,
you know, that it sold

56:39.697 --> 56:41.130
in the time it took you
to get here.

56:41.132 --> 56:42.564
That's not uncommon
in this business.

56:42.566 --> 56:44.733
And if that is
the case,

56:44.735 --> 56:47.069
I deeply apologize,

56:47.071 --> 56:50.439
and I will take
very good care of you...

56:50.441 --> 56:51.874
On one of these
arctic silvers.

56:51.876 --> 56:53.409
Like I told you--

56:53.411 --> 56:55.043
but before we
rush to judgment,

56:55.045 --> 56:57.446
let me check with
one of my managers.

56:57.448 --> 56:59.982
I mean, for all I know,
it was sent out for
a window tint or something.

56:59.984 --> 57:01.817
Yeah, right.
Okay.

57:01.819 --> 57:03.152
Let's head in.

57:03.154 --> 57:04.086
You want a hot dog?

57:04.088 --> 57:05.421
Vegetarian.

57:05.423 --> 57:06.522
Vegan hot dog?

57:06.524 --> 57:08.757
Hey, man,
don't patronize me.

57:08.759 --> 57:10.859
Then don't play stupid
with me, Mr. mcmillen.

57:10.861 --> 57:12.928
Come on, man.
You signed a contract.

57:12.930 --> 57:16.632
You can't just unwind
because your wife didn't
give you permission.

57:22.839 --> 57:25.941
Look, okay, I get it.

57:25.943 --> 57:28.677
You came in yesterday
without your wife,

57:28.679 --> 57:30.446
wanted to just look around,

57:30.448 --> 57:33.549
and then you happened to find
something that you liked.

57:33.551 --> 57:34.883
It's okay.

57:34.885 --> 57:36.885
Hey, it happens, all right?

57:36.887 --> 57:39.888
You're not the first,
and you're certainly
not gonna be the last.

57:39.890 --> 57:42.491
You know, this is why
people hate buying cars.

57:42.493 --> 57:43.692
Right, because
it's our fault

57:43.694 --> 57:45.160
that you made
a major purchase

57:45.162 --> 57:46.728
without talking
to your wife first.

57:46.730 --> 57:48.931
I can see how we'd
be to blame for that.

57:48.933 --> 57:50.098
Here. I'll tell you what.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.533
If it'll help
smooth things over,

57:51.535 --> 57:52.901
why don't you
have your wife call me?

57:52.903 --> 57:55.704
I'm serious.
Anytime, okay? Maybe--

57:55.706 --> 57:57.673
no, I don't think so.
Think I'm gonna call
the Attorney General.

57:57.675 --> 57:59.741
I think this is
a matter that he would
like to discuss.

57:59.743 --> 58:02.244
You know what?
That is a great idea.

58:02.246 --> 58:05.047
You should call him,
and when you get Gary
on the line,

58:05.049 --> 58:07.182
I want you to ask him
how Debra, his wife,
is doing

58:07.184 --> 58:09.585
and how she's
enjoying that new suburban
she's driving,

58:09.587 --> 58:12.020
you know, the one
she's borrowing from us.

58:12.022 --> 58:14.590
Mr. mcmillen,
you got a great car.

58:14.592 --> 58:16.091
Enjoy it.

58:18.528 --> 58:20.128
Want a hot dog?

58:22.198 --> 58:23.198
Nice work.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.800
I have my moments.

58:24.802 --> 58:26.668
Don't forget to hide
that idiot's trade-in.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.737
I don't want him
getting any bright ideas.

58:28.739 --> 58:31.940
I won't, just as long
as you don't forget
about your wife.

58:51.761 --> 58:53.295
I--
i go to sleep,

58:53.297 --> 58:54.897
you're not home.

58:54.899 --> 58:57.766
I get up,
you're already gone.

58:57.768 --> 58:59.301
And if we do manage
to share a word,

58:59.303 --> 59:00.903
it almost always ends
in a car deal.

59:02.705 --> 59:04.006
Okay.

59:05.942 --> 59:07.576
I...

59:07.578 --> 59:09.845
I hear you,
all right? I do.

59:09.847 --> 59:10.913
I'm listening, okay?

59:10.915 --> 59:13.649
But I really
need you to hear me.

59:13.651 --> 59:15.183
I need
one more day--

59:15.185 --> 59:17.119
okay, mark, this isn't
about one more day.

59:17.121 --> 59:19.187
This is about
what's best for you

59:19.189 --> 59:21.223
taking priority over anyone
or anything else.

59:21.225 --> 59:23.759
I mean, this is about
you choosing the store
above our marriage,

59:23.761 --> 59:25.627
and that
all doesn't change
with one more day.

59:25.629 --> 59:27.930
Ashley, I have been
working my ass off--

59:27.932 --> 59:30.699
you really think your dad's
just gonna suddenly up
and change his ways?

59:30.701 --> 59:32.834
No! But it
doesn't matter.

59:32.836 --> 59:34.102
Okay? It doesn't,

59:34.104 --> 59:36.204
because as soon
as I have my new store,

59:36.206 --> 59:38.574
you have no idea.
Everything is gonna
change for us, okay--

59:38.576 --> 59:40.709
mark, that's the problem.

59:42.145 --> 59:44.746
The new store
shouldn't be the catalyst

59:44.748 --> 59:46.615
for things being different.

59:48.217 --> 59:50.619
So what are you
saying, ash?

59:53.590 --> 59:56.224
'Cause you lead
a pretty good life.

59:59.696 --> 01:00:00.829
I...

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.838
And you know what, mark?

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:13.241
Just once,

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:16.378
I wish you would talk to me
like I'm your wife

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.614
and not some customer,
okay?

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:23.352
No clichés,
no number one rules,

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:26.121
no whatever it takes,
just once.

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.965
Yeah.

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:39.668
You're right.

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:48.944
Look--

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.781
Hey, mark,

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.650
just wanted
to let you know

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.051
your dad's
looking for you.

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:07.195
I...

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:14.069
Malcolm, on P.A.:
Mark to my office.

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:17.105
Mark to my office.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:49.104
When I page you,
it's for a reason.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:50.472
I was handling heat.

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:51.840
I don't give a shit.
What about the 150 grand?

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:53.041
Have you talked
to Russell?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.476
Yes. I spoke to him,
and we're good.

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:56.411
He said he's personally
deposit it on Monday.

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:58.180
And you were
gonna tell me when?

01:01:58.182 --> 01:01:59.414
For the holidays?
Maybe for my birthday?

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:00.949
As a gift?
Put a bow on it?

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:02.851
I'm telling you now!
For sure?

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.086
Yes! He's one
of my best friends!

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:05.454
He's a used-car
wholesaler.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:07.089
I give you my word.

01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:08.090
Your word?

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.193
Good.

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:13.729
And what about the car

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:15.464
that Scott
gave away this morning?
The barretts?

01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:17.799
She's coming in an hour.
I'll handle it.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:19.267
Uh, you better.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:21.837
'Cause contrary
to what you think,

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:24.139
this is not
a charitable organization.

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.407
Now what about you?

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:26.475
19 cars.

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:27.809
19 cars.

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:29.344
Better get back to work.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:31.179
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.449
Sheri, I assure you,
no one's trying

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:36.118
to bait and switch you,
okay?

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.020
But like I said,
I'd be more than happy

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:41.490
to give you 100 over cost
on any other vehicle
i have on stock.

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:43.191
No, I think I'm done
with the runaround.

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.793
But I'll be sure
to let the better
business bureau

01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:47.028
know about
your practices.

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:49.364
Then maybe next time
you'll think twice
about telling a customer

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:51.366
you have a car
in inventory
when you don't.

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:54.069
Again, sheri,
that wasn't the case at all.

01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:55.504
Oh, well,
i think it was.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.906
And you'll be hearing
from my senator as well.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:00.342
Your senator?

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:01.476
Heh. Wow.

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.545
You know, usually
customers threaten

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:06.414
to sic the attorney
general on me,
but a senator,

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:09.851
well played, sheri,
really well played.

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:12.988
And what, I suppose
you've got him
on direct dial?

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.556
You know, I put
millions of dollars...

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:16.258
Where are we at?
Look right here.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.960
...and I can't get him
to return my calls,

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.529
so good luck
with that, sweetheart.

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.365
Hey, Reynolds, how's
the selling coming?

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:27.169
I hope that little bitch
does call her senator.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:29.271
Fix it. Go.

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:31.540
Yo, boss, I got one.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:32.908
There's a couple
out there

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.209
that just sold
their old car,

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:35.477
and they're looking
for a new one.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.012
Okay, relax.
Did they pick out
a car yet?

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.079
No, not yet. I think
they're looking--

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:39.114
Christian, please,

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:40.215
can you take
the puppy outside?

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:41.850
Come on.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:44.119
Let's get you
outside before you
piss yourself.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:45.187
Fuck, yeah.

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:47.322
All right, everybody,
listen up!

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:50.358
It's 2:15, and we are
sitting on 20 cars,

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.262
which means we have
less than three hours
and 15 cars to go!

01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:57.499
That means there are
15 people in the great
state of Arizona

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:00.368
that are looking
for you to connect them
with a new vehicle.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.437
What do you say
we make that happen?

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:04.406
Time to rock-'n'-roll!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:10.979
Hi.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.016
What do you think, man?

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.027
He said he wants
to pay invoice.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.929
Tell him when he
rounds up $10 million,

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:30.966
he can buy his own store
and pay invoice for
any car he likes,

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:32.300
but until then,
that's the price.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:34.236
I'm making no money
off of this deal,

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:35.871
just so you know.

01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:38.173
And I still have to pay
these two guys commission.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:40.642
You see 'em? All right?
So do we got a deal?

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:43.245
Safety and
fuel economy, okay?

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:44.479
25 mpg city...

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.481
I think
we have a match.

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:50.051
I love your hair
with the color
of this car.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.354
How 'bout now?

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:01.529
Watch and learn.

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:03.565
Just sold one to Katy Perry.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.000
Woman: Oh!
Same color.

01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:06.568
Oh, my god.
It has Bluetooth...

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.137
Fisher, hi.
Heard the divorce is final.

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:12.007
I have a lot of convertibles
i think you'd be
interested in.

01:05:32.062 --> 01:05:33.495
What's that
gonna cost us?

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.363
No, it comes
with the car, sweetie.

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:37.132
Yeah, sweetie,
it comes with the car.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:45.206
I was only
able to--bam!

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.944
Hey, let's go ring
the big bell.

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.211
Singer: All good.
You know I got this...

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:28.750
Come on.
Yeah.

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:30.518
Board it.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.521
Singer: What? Extra?
It'll be all good. Don't...

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.626
I love this car
for you.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.395
So what do we think?
I love it.

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:42.163
I'll tell you
after I see the numbers.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.632
Nice rally.

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:47.202
I can't wait
for that pep talk
come Monday.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:48.203
Save it.

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:53.108
We got a live one, <i>jefe.</i>

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:56.444
I got 'em downing
l-tryptophan dogs
as we speak,

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:58.179
so I figure
in about 15 minutes,

01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:00.081
I'll have 'em right
where I want 'em, comatose.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:01.649
That's good,
because right now,

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:03.351
we are sitting
at 299,

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:05.720
so that means you
don't let 'em leave.

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:07.322
We understand?
Right.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:09.190
All right.
Go get 'em.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:11.326
Green pea.

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:12.527
Hey, what office
are you in?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.728
Christian: 64-04.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:14.529
Max, pull it up.

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.103
Christian: You know
your finances better
than I do, tom,

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:24.272
and quite frankly,
i don't see how

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:26.307
we can get there.
I mean, look,

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:28.076
I have no problem
giving you a great deal,

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:29.611
but honestly
i think we'd be lucky

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:34.115
if we got anywhere near
the 600 to 625 a month
range.

01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.317
Yeah, here's what
you should know.

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:41.156
This is the last altima xl
that we have in stock, tom,

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:43.825
and it could be--
actually, I believe,

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.494
the last one that we have
in the entire state.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.829
Actually, Christian,
there's one out back.

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:49.464
It's in the--
it's in the back, right?

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.699
The one with
the defective motor

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:54.602
that's being returned
to the manufacturer.

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:56.371
Heh.
I should also let you know,

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:58.640
tom, that a few
of the other salesmen

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:00.508
have confirmed appointments
today on this very vehicle,

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:03.344
and, jan, I mean, I would
hate to see you lose it.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:05.146
I mean, I know
how much you love it.

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:06.681
Now, listen, if I could--

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:08.850
and I'm not saying that
i can, but if I could, jan,

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:12.854
split it with you
and, let's say,
get the payments to...

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:17.125
575 a month plus tax,

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:18.393
look at that.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:21.362
Would you be willing
to buy and drive today?

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.363
I'm sorry, Christian.

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:23.832
$500 a month,

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.533
or we're gonna
have to pass.

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:28.536
Well, as certain as I am

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.538
that 500 a month
does not buy this car,

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:34.242
I don't make the decisions.
I just present the offers.

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.810
So sit tight, tom,

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.546
and, uh, let me see
what I can do.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:40.881
Jan: Honey, I thought
you said we'd go

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:43.451
as high as 550 a month.
Tom: If we have to.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.819
But there's no way in hell
I'm telling him that.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:47.488
If you ever open your mouth

01:08:47.491 --> 01:08:49.256
when I'm closing
a deal, I will break

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:50.692
your fucking neck.
Do you understand me?

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:51.859
Yeah.
Motherfuck.

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.528
Tom: ...Just let me
handle this, okay?

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.430
I mean, this is
how you play the game.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:58.867
They always start real high,
and then you gotta
Jew 'em down.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.868
Jan: You know I hate that.

01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:03.238
All right, it's 100 bucks
of my own money

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.506
plus the store's 100
if Christian can trunk
this prick.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:06.508
Who wants in?
In.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:07.908
Throw 10 in
on this asshole.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:10.310
I got 20
on this anti-semite.
Let's do this.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:11.479
Got 50 on it.
35.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.613
Christian,
take him down.

01:09:12.616 --> 01:09:15.350
255, plus
the store's 100

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:16.783
if you can
trunk him,

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:18.486
but we have to sell
that car first.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.354
Sharon.
Eh?

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.189
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute. I'm not
turning these chumps.

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:23.591
Who said anything
about turning them?

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:24.759
Christian, you missed
half the conversation

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.426
on your way
up to the sales tower.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:27.694
Jan doesn't know it,

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:29.564
but she just closed
the deal for you.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:32.167
Now, you two up for
a little "playhouse 90"?

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.872
Go get 'em.

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:42.510
Tom, jan, I'm sorry.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.746
My boss said exactly
what I thought he would.

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:47.749
"Christian, I have
two confirmed appointments
due any minute,

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:52.520
both of whom have
been quoted payments
of $625 a month."

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.822
Yeah, $625 a month.

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:57.392
That's what I said.
I said, "hell, no, boss.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:58.493
"That will not fly.

01:09:58.495 --> 01:10:00.461
"Jan and tom
are good people.

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.730
"They'll give us referrals,
repeat business.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:05.366
I'm not gonna
ask them to pay that.
You gotta do better."

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:07.969
So just for you...

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.405
This is what he said
he could do.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.977
Christian, I'm sorry,
but $580 a month
is still too high.

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.581
Christian, hi.

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.982
Sorry to interrupt,
folks.

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:22.784
Do you have
the keys to the xl?

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:24.586
My customers
are back.

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:25.820
To the xl? Um...

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.290
Yeah. They're right here.

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.327
I think it's done.

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:33.728
Good luck.
Good luck.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.897
Thanks.

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.533
Um, I mean, sorry, jan.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:39.968
I mean, this is
the car business.

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:42.870
You win some, and
unfortunately you lose some.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:44.939
Wait. Wait. Uh...

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:50.278
Would you say
$550 a month?

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.279
Hmm?

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.850
I said...

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.886
580.

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:33.354
Board it.

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:34.622
Yes!
Oh!

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.791
Christian! Nice.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.926
Christian.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:40.662
Whoo! 300.

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:41.663
Sweet pea.

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:46.367
Go get the paperwork
off my dad's desk,
would you?

01:11:46.369 --> 01:11:47.802
All right, green pea,

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:50.305
what do you say we go
pick up some loose change?

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:52.607
Trunk him!

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:53.875
Trunk! Trunk! Trunk!

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:55.009
Trunk! Trunk! Trunk!

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.678
Trunk! Trunk! Trunk!

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.079
You could
sleep in there.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:11:59.681
It's unbelievable.
You could sleep.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:01.015
You could go camping.
Yeah.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.850
Oh, we've always
wanted to do that.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:04.352
I mean, hop in.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.387
I mean, let me show you
h-how big it is.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:07.689
I mean, hop in. Jan?

01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:09.390
Hop in there.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:11.926
Yeah, come on.
I'm not with the cartel.

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.594
Go on, honey.
Hop in.

01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:15.463
No, you hop in.
Yeah, you hop in.

01:12:15.465 --> 01:12:16.664
Here. Come on.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.032
No. He's kidding.
He's kidding.

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:20.735
Come on. I want to show you
how big that is, jan.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.837
I mean, you put in there--
oh, my gosh.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:23.971
How' bout that?

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:25.573
It--it is roomy.
It's so roomy.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:26.908
Would you get out
of there, please?

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.076
Honey...
Get out. Come on.

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:29.777
Hey, tom, get in there
with your wife.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:30.945
That's enough.
Ah, I'll hop in.

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:32.380
I'll hop in--okay.
No.

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:33.648
All right.
There--it is...

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.083
Look at that.
You just get in there.

01:12:35.085 --> 01:12:36.084
Just--that's..

01:12:36.086 --> 01:12:37.085
Look how much room
you have.

01:12:37.087 --> 01:12:38.619
There.
Are you happy?

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:40.054
Look at that.
It's like being
on a date.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:42.023
Tom: Hey!

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.627
Right now!
Jan: Excuse me.

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:50.098
Hey, give--
that is not funny.

01:12:51.835 --> 01:12:53.768
Just wait till i
sign the paperwork,

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:55.770
and then you pull
this kind of stunt?

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:57.438
Come on.
Honey, relax.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.073
It was just
a little funny.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.747
Hey, how did it go
with the Mercedes guy?

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:06.914
Already boarded.
Everything okay?

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.852
Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:12.954
Other than my old man
moving the bar on me.

01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:14.522
Yeah.
Yeah. Everything's fine.

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:16.791
That's not exactly
what I was talking about.

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.826
Yeah, I know
exactly what you were
talking about, Sharon.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:21.095
I just don't want to get
into it with you.
Ah.

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:23.097
Come on. Sharon--
what? Oh, yeah.

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:25.032
I know. You got a lot
on your plate right now.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:26.901
You think?
Yeah. All she's asking

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:29.437
is for you to make her
and your marriage
a priority.

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:31.706
Stop.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:34.108
She's here
grasping at straws,

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.977
trying everything she can
to keep your marriage together,

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:37.578
and what you manage to do
is belittle her.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.046
Belittle? How?

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:40.748
How am i
belittling her?

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.116
I'm surprised,
after everything

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:43.684
you've put her through
in the last three years

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:44.819
that you haven't
already come home

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.487
and found your shit
in the driveway.

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:48.122
She should be
the most important thing
in your life.

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:49.557
She is.

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:51.426
Act like it.

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:59.066
Because we all
have a breaking point,

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:02.937
and I'm pretty sure
Ashley's very close
to hers.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.673
You gotta trust me.
I know that look.

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:09.010
What look?

01:14:09.012 --> 01:14:11.112
When you left her there
sitting alone.

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:15.950
It's the same look
i gave my ex...

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:20.154
Right before
he became my ex.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:29.964
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:31.499
Welcome to
the Chamberlain auto team.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.201
Thank you.
Someone I can help you find?

01:14:33.203 --> 01:14:34.869
Christian, please.
Sure. Right this way.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:39.674
And what about the car
that Scott gave away
this morning?

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:41.943
Is this the mother
from Christian's
two-car deal?

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.044
Christian: Trust me.
Deal's done.

01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:44.979
Closed?
Have I ever let you down?

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.815
'Cause I have a number
that I need to hit
by the end of the day.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:48.950
Ashley is threatening
to leave.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:50.017
Apparently you're
confusing me

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:51.219
with someone
who gives a shit.

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:56.591
If I hit that number,
then everything is gonna be

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:57.892
completely different
for you and me.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:59.727
300 cars, Boyd.
Mark, listen to me.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:00.995
Don't bullshit me.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.964
I'm not unwinding shit,
not today.

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:06.767
Mark, you hit 300,
and that new dealership
is yours.

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:08.769
What do you need me to do?
Whatever it takes.

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.143
Mark: Hi.
So sorry to interrupt.

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:17.745
Ms. Barrett,
I'm mark Chamberlain,
the owner.

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:18.746
Oh.
Great to meet you.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:20.214
Hi, Nikki.
Hi.

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:22.583
Nice to meet you.
Listen, I just wanted
to come down

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:24.085
and personally thank you
both for your business.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:25.620
Um, do you have a minute?

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:27.655
Sure, sure.
You'll be okay
for a minute.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.056
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah, just this way.

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:30.258
Okay.
Thank you so much.

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.797
Mr. Chamberlain?

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:41.536
$100 more a month?

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.037
You're joking, right,

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.906
because that's not
what we agreed to
last night.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:51.946
We made a deal,
and a deal is a deal.

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:54.015
I know you have
month-end sales
objectives.

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:56.817
I'm in sales, too.
We take short sales
all the time.

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.192
I just can't take
a deal this short.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:07.762
Now, that being said,
i want to do whatever
it takes--

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:09.730
I'm sorry to
hear you say that,
Mr. Chamberlain,

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.732
because not only
have you lost
my deal today,

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:12.767
you've lost
my daughter's.

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:14.669
Okay, Mrs. Barrett,
please--

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:16.170
sorry to interrupt,
mark, but we
need to talk.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:17.204
No, no, no.
Not right now.

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.205
No, seriously,
we need to talk.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.041
Boyd, give me a minute.

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:23.077
Okay.

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:25.179
All right.

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:30.685
My daughter and i
will be happy

01:16:30.687 --> 01:16:32.053
to take our business
somewhere else.

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:34.055
Okay, Mrs. Barrett,
i completely own this mistake.

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:38.092
I know it's asking a lot,

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:40.962
but I would really
appreciate the opportunity

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.965
to at least try
and make this deal work.

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.780
Okay.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.985
So let me see.

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:06.654
Okay, I see you--
you've been looking

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:09.890
at the vehicle
with the suede leather seats.
Is that right?

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:11.025
That's right.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:14.362
Great.
And the panoramic sunroof.

01:17:14.364 --> 01:17:16.030
Yes.
Nice.

01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:18.899
And the--
the premium sound.

01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:21.035
Yes.

01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:23.337
I have to admit,
it is a nice vehicle.

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:25.640
I know. That's why
i bought it.

01:17:25.642 --> 01:17:27.241
Or thought
i bought it.

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:30.378
I assume that
Christian took you out
on a test drive, right?

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:33.748
He did.
Around the block,

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:37.318
or, um, he let you
open it up on the freeway?

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:40.287
The freeway.

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:42.356
That's good.
That's great.

01:17:42.358 --> 01:17:44.759
You know, obviously we're
not supposed to do that
for insurance reasons,

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:47.094
but I'm glad that
Christian was taking
good care of you,

01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:48.729
because truly
that is the only way--

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:50.665
Mr. Chamberlain,
I'm a busy woman.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:52.133
Do you have
an offer to make?

01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:02.743
Mrs. Barrett,
i appreciate how patient
you're being with me here,

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:07.314
but the odds of you
finding another white
limited edition Chevy Tahoe

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:10.718
with all of these features
is pretty small.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.154
To be honest, finding
any white limited edition SUV

01:18:13.156 --> 01:18:16.190
in the state of Arizona
right now is practically
impossible.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.325
I know the competition.
I know their inventory.

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:21.328
You go to any dealership
right now, and I promise you
you're not gonna find--

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:22.897
Mr. Chamberlain--

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:24.732
you're obviously
a very successful

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:26.133
businesswoman,
Mrs. Barrett,

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:28.469
and I am not trying
to pull one over
on you here.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:31.305
I am just trying
to make sure that you
have all of the facts

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:32.306
before you make
your decision.

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:35.242
Now obviously
as a successful businesswoman,

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:37.378
you know more than most
that time is money,

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.714
and I'm not just trying
to save you time here.

01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:41.015
I'm actually
saving you money.

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:44.018
Oh, yeah?
How do you figure?

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.052
What's your current
monthly car payment
right now?

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.454
$600 a month.

01:18:46.456 --> 01:18:48.089
$600 a month,
and that's on a car

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:49.724
that's about a year
out of warranty, right?

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:50.891
That's right.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:53.027
Okay, so in that
short amount of time,

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:55.930
how much do you think
you've spent on maintenance,
repairs?

01:18:55.932 --> 01:18:57.898
500 bucks?
Try more like 1,000,

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.900
which is why I'm trying
to get rid of it.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:02.069
Right. And I bet you
haven't budgeted for
that thousand, right?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.105
Because nobody does ever,
including me, by the way,

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:06.907
and I work in the business.
So you take that $1,000,

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.777
and then you divide it
by 12 months, what do you get?

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.045
$83.

01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:13.314
And 33 cents,
on top of the monthly payment.

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:20.087
With all due respect,
Mrs. Barrett,

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.455
I'm actually
saving you money.

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:26.127
That's a fair point.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.399
I see you're
a coffee drinker.

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:35.202
My addiction...

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:37.505
Triple soy lattes,

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:39.807
extra hot.

01:19:39.809 --> 01:19:41.008
You?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.344
Large double-caff,
extra hot.

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:45.379
Look, I'm just having
a good time here,

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:48.315
but with the $83
i just saved you,
that's what,

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:51.218
16 free large
double-caff lattes?

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.220
Extra hot.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.857
Listen, Mr. Chamberlain,

01:19:56.859 --> 01:19:58.526
you're making some
really good points here,

01:19:58.528 --> 01:20:00.261
but I really
don't like being--

01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:01.495
taken advantage of.

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:03.230
I know.

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:11.438
You know that land
they're clearing
down by Greenway on the 101?

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.007
Yeah.

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:15.543
They're clearing that
for a new dealership.

01:20:15.545 --> 01:20:18.946
My new dealership.

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:24.852
Look, Mrs. Barrett,

01:20:24.854 --> 01:20:27.388
I know how people feel
about car salesmen.

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:30.090
Most of the time,
i completely understand.

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.329
I can't tell you
how much I wanna build
something different...

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:40.201
A place
where something like this
doesn't have to happen.

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:44.138
I want to build a place
where I don't

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.874
have to let go
of one of my best guys
because of it.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.244
You might not
believe this,

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.446
but I want to build
a dealership that's...

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:56.517
Based on, you know,
relationships,

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:59.353
and not just
in the short term,

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:03.224
but I want to take care
of your daughter and
your daughter's daughter.

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:06.160
I want you to come
to me every time
you want to buy a car,

01:21:06.162 --> 01:21:08.162
not because you feel
like you have to,

01:21:08.164 --> 01:21:09.396
but because you want to.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.403
You know, I'm married,

01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:20.241
hopefully starting
a family soon,

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:21.508
so I get it.

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:24.245
And that's why I really,

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:30.050
really want to do business
with you here today.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.621
So what do you say?

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.661
Oh, yeah,
aerobics, jazzercise,
i mean, high impact--

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:42.096
mark: Tyler.

01:21:42.098 --> 01:21:43.430
Do you know
where Christian is?

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.933
Yeah, I think, um--
I'm not sure.

01:21:45.935 --> 01:21:48.636
Okay. It's fine.
Uh, you know where
detail is, right?

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:50.971
Could you please grab
Mrs. Barrett's new SUV

01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:52.273
and take it over there?
Yes, sir.

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:53.307
Thank you.
Mrs. Barrett--

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:55.342
please, Nancy.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:57.411
Nancy.
Such a pleasure.

01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:59.280
And, please,
once the new store
is finished,

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:01.482
come by, and pop in.
We'll grab one
of those lattes.

01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:03.484
It's a deal.
Thank you so much, mark.

01:22:03.486 --> 01:22:04.985
Take care.

01:22:04.987 --> 01:22:06.553
Nancy: All right.

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:13.093
You know that
puts me at 30, right?

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:15.329
And how do you
get to 30?

01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:17.164
Closed the one
earlier today.
Right.

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:18.532
Then the two-car
deal here.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:20.167
Which I really
shouldn't count,
but go on.

01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:21.568
Plus the one
i just wrapped up

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:23.671
with jan and tom.
Bonus time, baby.

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:25.706
You mean the half
that you wrapped up
with jan and tom.

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:28.342
No, the guy I trunked.
With green pea.

01:22:28.344 --> 01:22:29.977
Yeah, I'm no mathematician,

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:32.579
but I'm pretty sure
that 26

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:36.383
plus 3 1/2,

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:38.485
yeah. Yeah,
that doesn't equal 30.

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:40.220
Sorry, chief.

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:44.558
Sharing is caring. 29 1/2.

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:55.436
Sorry, man.

01:22:55.438 --> 01:22:58.339
Mm. Nothing like
half a deal

01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:01.608
costing you, what,
two, three grand?

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.412
There he is.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:07.681
So how often does
that happen, huh?

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:09.616
First day on the job,
and not only

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:12.119
do I sell a car,
but I trunk somebody?

01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:13.120
Whew.
Green pea--

01:23:13.122 --> 01:23:14.388
nah, it's Tyler now.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.023
I remember mark
saying specifically

01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:18.592
I got a name
once I sold a car.

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:20.327
Right. And speaking
of remembering,

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.763
do you remember
that little story
this morning

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:25.199
I told you
about the lion
and the gazelle?

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:26.533
Oh, yeah. What about it?

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.271
Because there's
one part of the story,

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:35.175
ahh, I completely
left out.

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:36.176
Yeah. What's that?

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:41.715
In every lion pride,
there's a king.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:43.283
I already knew that.
Right.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:45.152
But what you
didn't know

01:23:45.154 --> 01:23:48.188
is that the king...

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.691
Always eats first.

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.231
Is that just another
number one rule?

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.434
Jump up and down
for me.

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:07.341
Jump up and down.
No, seriously.

01:24:07.343 --> 01:24:08.709
Come on.
Jump up and down.
It's cool.

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:09.710
There you go.

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:13.781
Ah, come on. Jump.
I know.

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.650
Good.

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:18.485
Now that your balls
have dropped,

01:24:18.487 --> 01:24:21.355
I can explain
to you the reason
for our lesson.

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:25.092
There is
no number one rule.

01:24:25.094 --> 01:24:28.562
Okay?
It changes to fit
the circumstances.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.265
Whatever it takes,
Tyler.

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.780
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:49.316
That depends.
Are you mark Chamberlain?

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:51.585
I am.
Then, yes, you can.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.587
I assume this is
in regards to
Mr. mcmillen,

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.756
and we already spoke
this afternoon,

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:59.226
so I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to refer
you to my attorney.

01:24:59.228 --> 01:25:02.563
Mr. Chamberlain,
i have no idea
who our Mr. mcmillen is.

01:25:02.565 --> 01:25:05.332
However, I do represent
someone else,

01:25:05.334 --> 01:25:09.269
and you, sir,
have been served.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:11.672
Have a great day.

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.509
Sometime
they're doing this
next week.

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:18.512
What do you think?
Yeah?

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:43.237
Yeah, Sharon told me.

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:45.639
Look, sorry, man,

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:47.407
but when you started
selling everybody out,

01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:49.209
all for the shot
at a store--

01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:51.378
man, this wasn't
just about a store.

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.613
Then what was it, mark?

01:25:56.451 --> 01:26:00.621
You know, when I was
about 9 or 10 years old,

01:26:00.623 --> 01:26:04.658
I used to, uh, sleep over
at my best friend's house.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.394
Fucking--
fucking tough as nails,

01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:09.396
runt of a kid...

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:14.468
Whose dad used to beat
the shit out of him
pretty regularly.

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:18.872
Black and blue, welts,

01:26:18.874 --> 01:26:20.807
the works.

01:26:21.877 --> 01:26:25.612
And as horrific
as that was...

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:31.718
It wasn't
the craziest thing,

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.921
because the craziest thing

01:26:33.923 --> 01:26:36.790
was this kid would
walk around his house

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:39.293
all the time
with his shirt off...

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:47.234
Like those bruises
were a badge of honor.

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:50.304
And I'd ask him.

01:26:50.306 --> 01:26:52.839
I'd say--I'd say,
"why are you doing this?

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:54.575
Why not just run away?"

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:58.845
You know what
he said to me?

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:03.750
He said,
"he's my father, mark."

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:08.288
"If I do that, he wins."

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:14.261
But he's my father, Boyd.

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.932
And I've taken
my own beatings,
all right?

01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:23.470
But today
i made 300 cars happen.

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.708
Today, I got my own store.

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:29.476
Today, I've won.

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.947
But I just--i would
expect you of all people

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:35.315
to understand that.

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:39.820
I do, mark.

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:47.995
But I told you that
when I was 10.

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:54.601
You gotta be
kidding me, man.

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:42.916
Steve: Boy, we just
received the numbers,
Mr. Chamberlain,

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:45.752
and I have to say
that is quite a day
you guys put together.

01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:47.988
Well, I know. I know.
What can I say?

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:50.857
Mark's a comer.
He'll own his own store
someday.

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:54.094
Well, it looks to me
like we're all set
for Monday, huh?

01:28:54.096 --> 01:28:58.565
Yes, sir. I'll have
the $300,000 in escrow

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:00.367
first thing
Monday morning,

01:29:00.369 --> 01:29:02.936
and we're
just finishing putting
the financing together.

01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:04.371
Well, that's fantastic.

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:06.006
I gotta hand it to you
and--and mark

01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:07.841
and everybody
at the dealership.

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:10.777
You guys
have really knocked one
out of the park this time.

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:12.612
On behalf
of the manufacturers,

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:14.448
I have to tell you...
Looking for this?

01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:15.916
...earned this
new dealership,

01:29:15.918 --> 01:29:17.751
and I look forward
to coming down and
breaking it in--

01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:18.919
Steve, I gotta
call you back.

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:21.955
You know,
for the past 20 years,

01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:25.359
I have done nothing
but everything you
ever told me to.

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:27.794
Scrubbing toilets.

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:31.098
Picking up cigarette butts.

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.033
Withholding payment...
Firing Scott.

01:29:33.035 --> 01:29:35.535
And every fucking thing
in between, and this...

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.873
This is how you repay me?

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:42.142
With some bullshit
promise of a store

01:29:42.144 --> 01:29:44.144
so that I can grind
on these guys

01:29:44.146 --> 01:29:47.047
because they won't
work for a lowlife
piece of shit like this?

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:50.550
You lie to me, you use me,
and then you fuck me?

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:52.719
Who are you
all of a sudden,

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:54.588
Saint mark
the apostle?

01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:57.724
You have the audacity
to come in here

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.159
with your righteous
indignation

01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:01.895
and preach to me
about using and
lying to people?

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:03.930
What do you think you've
done all day today?

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:06.533
You lie and used
every one of those
guys out there.

01:30:06.535 --> 01:30:08.468
No, what I did,
i did to push them.

01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:09.836
I wanted them to be
better salesmen!

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:12.072
Who do you think
you're talking to?

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:16.176
You may have peddled
that to--to your wife
and to Boyd,

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:18.111
but I'm sure as hell
not buying it.

01:30:18.113 --> 01:30:20.113
I mean, you can
rationalize it
all you want,

01:30:20.115 --> 01:30:21.715
but you did what you did

01:30:21.717 --> 01:30:23.884
for the same reason
i do what I do,

01:30:23.886 --> 01:30:25.919
self-interest,
nothing more,
nothing less.

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.924
And that's
what I needed to know,

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:33.493
were you willing to do
whatever it takes.

01:30:33.495 --> 01:30:35.662
Even if it means
screwing over
your own son?

01:30:35.664 --> 01:30:36.730
Now you got it!

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:45.472
What if I'm
not willing to do that?

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:47.774
That's why your name

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.810
is not on this
piece of paper

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:51.711
and, I'm sad to say,

01:30:51.713 --> 01:30:54.481
you will never own
your own dealership,

01:30:54.483 --> 01:30:55.816
certainly
not the new one.

01:30:55.818 --> 01:30:57.083
Yeah.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.655
Well, I guess
that makes two of us,

01:31:01.657 --> 01:31:02.789
because neither will you.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:04.057
How do you figure?

01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:05.592
The way I see it,

01:31:05.594 --> 01:31:07.961
you're still
150 grand short,
old man.

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.932
Oh, that's what
I'm talking about!

01:31:11.934 --> 01:31:14.935
Where--where has
this mark been for
the last 20 years, huh?

01:31:14.937 --> 01:31:18.104
Are you saying what i
think you're saying,

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:21.007
that you want
to negotiate?
Let's negotiate.

01:31:21.009 --> 01:31:22.943
Who said anything
about negotiating?

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.584
I quit.

01:31:30.586 --> 01:31:33.253
No, I don't think you're
gonna walk away, mark.

01:31:33.255 --> 01:31:35.155
Nah.

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.790
You need to get real,
son.

01:31:36.792 --> 01:31:38.124
Fuck you, dad.

01:31:42.264 --> 01:31:43.864
That's good.
I like that.

01:31:43.866 --> 01:31:46.666
Now, are we gonna keep
jacking each other off,

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:49.035
or do you want to do
some business?

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:56.810
Business?

01:31:56.812 --> 01:31:58.578
What do you want?

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:00.046
51% ownership, 5% gross.

01:32:00.048 --> 01:32:01.548
5%, that's funny.

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:04.284
I'm not finished.
I take my own guys,

01:32:04.286 --> 01:32:07.287
and this motherfucker
never sets foot on my lot

01:32:07.289 --> 01:32:09.022
ever.

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.628
Deal.

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:19.833
But just so you know
how the business works,

01:32:19.835 --> 01:32:22.035
that 5% has to come
from somewhere,

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:25.005
so if you want
to wrap this up
right now,

01:32:25.007 --> 01:32:26.606
here's what
you're gonna do.

01:32:26.608 --> 01:32:29.576
You are gonna walk
into that sales tower,

01:32:29.578 --> 01:32:31.144
and you're gonna
tell those guys

01:32:31.146 --> 01:32:33.246
that not only are
they not getting
their paychecks Monday,

01:32:33.248 --> 01:32:34.848
but there is
a new pay plan

01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:37.717
and you are reducing
their commissions...

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.688
By 5%.

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.658
You do that,

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:46.159
and you're
a dealer, son.

01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:47.627
You can't
be serious.

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:55.001
And with ash
out of the way,

01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:58.004
you'll finally have
time to do it right.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.348
Taking long enough.

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:11.177
What the fuck?!

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:12.879
We had a deal!

01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:15.749
Relax. We still do.
Do you think

01:34:15.751 --> 01:34:18.018
I was actually
going to give him
the new store?

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.152
He signed it.

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.221
Rule number one
in the car business.

01:34:21.223 --> 01:34:23.223
Things change.

01:34:23.225 --> 01:34:25.659
Reynolds: So he's
not getting the store?

01:34:25.661 --> 01:34:27.894
Fuck, no.
I just wanted
to make sure

01:34:27.896 --> 01:34:30.864
we got that other
150 grand from
his buddy Russell.

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:34.401
What happens
when he finds out?

01:34:34.403 --> 01:34:37.904
What's he gonna do,
leave?

01:35:28.055 --> 01:35:29.222
Russell. Hey.

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:33.860
Yeah. Thanks for
calling me back
so quick.

01:35:33.862 --> 01:35:36.096
No, that's what we
need to talk about.

01:35:36.098 --> 01:35:40.233
It, uh, looks like
plans have changed
a little bit.

01:35:40.235 --> 01:35:44.137
No. No, I won't be
needing that money
after all.

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:47.173
Am I sure?

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.511
Yeah.

01:35:51.513 --> 01:35:52.746
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:11.431
Fuck!

01:36:14.069 --> 01:36:16.503
Out of my way,
bitches!

01:36:18.907 --> 01:36:20.273
Go handle it!

01:36:20.275 --> 01:36:22.142
Go!

01:36:22.144 --> 01:36:23.143
Fuck.

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:32.919
Watch out!

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:37.423
Dough, dough,
money, baby.

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:39.859
Get out of my way.

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:41.394
Whoa. Hey.
Money.

01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:53.139
ah, okay.

01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:55.475
Hey.

01:36:55.477 --> 01:36:56.476
Thank you, boss.

01:36:56.478 --> 01:36:57.577
Thank you.

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.114
Reynolds: All right,
all right, enough!

01:37:01.116 --> 01:37:02.248
Listen up! Listen up!

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.287
I want all that money back.

01:37:07.289 --> 01:37:10.390
And you can
forget about getting
your checks on Monday,

01:37:10.392 --> 01:37:12.258
because this motherfucker
doesn't work here anymore.

01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.360
What?
What?

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:16.196
Heh.

01:37:16.198 --> 01:37:17.397
Whoa. Hold on.
Hold on.

01:37:17.399 --> 01:37:18.598
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:19.833
Fuck him, mark.
Fuck him.

01:37:19.835 --> 01:37:21.000
He's not
worth it.

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:22.268
That's what I thought,
you pussy.

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:26.372
Ohh!
Ohh!

01:37:26.374 --> 01:37:27.907
Nice!

01:37:27.909 --> 01:37:29.309
Cash that check,
motherfucker.

01:37:30.846 --> 01:37:33.880
down goes Frazier.

01:37:33.882 --> 01:37:35.882
Oh, yeah,
the call on 64-01,

01:37:35.884 --> 01:37:37.884
that's for you, dick.

01:37:37.886 --> 01:37:39.419
I'll be praying
for you, Mike.

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:42.322
What the fuck
are you looking at?

01:37:42.324 --> 01:37:44.090
Mike Reynolds,
line two.

01:37:44.092 --> 01:37:45.625
Mike Reynolds, line two.

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:52.198
Mike Reynolds, line two.

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:56.603
This is Mike.
Woman: Yes, hello, Mike.

01:37:56.605 --> 01:37:59.005
I need to speak
to the owner.

01:37:59.007 --> 01:38:00.206
Would that be you?

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:02.041
Yes. Yes,
i am the owner.

01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:05.979
Good. I have
a call from senator
Mitch waters' office.

01:38:05.981 --> 01:38:09.515
The senator is very eager
to speak with you.
Hold, please.

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:12.452
Waters:
Mr. Chamberlain.

01:38:12.454 --> 01:38:13.453
Yes, senator.

01:38:13.455 --> 01:38:15.121
I heard
you had the pleasure

01:38:15.123 --> 01:38:16.990
of meeting
my daughter sheri at
your dealership today.

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:23.496
Mark: Every car dog
who's ever had

01:38:23.498 --> 01:38:25.431
the questionable fortune
of sitting through

01:38:25.433 --> 01:38:28.167
one of those seemingly
endless sales training seminars

01:38:28.169 --> 01:38:30.436
likely had
some hotshot sales guru

01:38:30.438 --> 01:38:33.139
insist that they
absolutely had to read

01:38:33.141 --> 01:38:35.174
og mandino's classic book,

01:38:35.176 --> 01:38:37.243
"the greatest salesman
in the world,"

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:40.546
and you can imagine how many
car dogs actually read it.

01:38:40.548 --> 01:38:43.449
And while it may not have
the answers to everything sales,

01:38:43.451 --> 01:38:45.451
I do remember one part
that was pretty good.

01:38:45.453 --> 01:38:47.320
It went something like this--

01:38:47.322 --> 01:38:50.156
"no, my son,
do not aspire for wealth,

01:38:50.158 --> 01:38:52.358
"and labor not only to be rich.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.427
"Strive instead for happiness,

01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:57.430
"to be loved and to love,

01:38:57.432 --> 01:38:59.599
"and most important,

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:02.368
to acquire peace of mind
and Serenity."

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:06.205
The funny thing is
the hotshot sales guru

01:39:06.207 --> 01:39:08.641
who gave me that book...
Ashley.

01:39:08.643 --> 01:39:09.709
My old man.

01:39:09.711 --> 01:39:11.377
Ashley: What do
you want, mark?

01:39:11.379 --> 01:39:12.979
I want to tell you
I'm sorry.

01:39:12.981 --> 01:39:15.248
I'm hoping we can
still have dinner.

01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:16.716
5:00, right?

01:39:17.305 --> 01:39:23.739
