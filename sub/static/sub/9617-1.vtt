RILEY MATTHEWS
FROM GREENWICH VILLAGE,

00:06.173 --> 00:09.308
NEW YORK CITY,
THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA,

00:09.310 --> 00:11.176
THE CONTINENT
OF NORTH AMERICA,

00:11.178 --> 00:13.178
WESTERN HEMISPHERE,
THE EARTH,

00:13.180 --> 00:15.280
THE SOLAR SYSTEM,
THE UNIVERSE.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.348
THE MIND OF GOD.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.183
AND IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL OF IT,

00:18.185 --> 00:19.885
IS JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
MIDDLE SCHOOL,

00:19.887 --> 00:21.887
ME AND MY FRIENDS,

00:21.889 --> 00:24.423
BECAUSE WE ARE
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.658
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.295
WHO'S READY
FOR A BRAND NEW YEAR?

00:31.198 --> 00:32.598
WHY ARE YOU STILL IN BED?

00:32.600 --> 00:34.666
IS HE GONNA
BE MY TEACHER?

00:35.603 --> 00:37.803
NO. WE ARE NOT
DOING THAT AGAIN.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.506
THAT WAS CRAZY.
NEW YEAR, NEW TEACHER,

00:40.508 --> 00:42.408
GET EXCITED,
BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

00:42.410 --> 00:45.310

00:45.312 --> 00:47.246
FIRST DAY OF THE NEW YEAR!

00:48.315 --> 00:50.849
-WHY ARE YOU STILL IN BED?
-ARE YOU GONNA BE MY TEACHER?

00:50.851 --> 00:54.286
NO! YOUR MOTHER AND I
WENT THROUGH THAT
WITH MR. FEENY.

00:54.288 --> 00:57.356
YEAH, OUR TEACHER
FROM SIXTH GRADE TO COLLEGE.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.793
-HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?
-IN AN UNEXPECTED...

01:00.795 --> 01:02.761
BUT COMPLETELY
BELIEVABLE WAY...

01:04.765 --> 01:06.398
-EVERY YEAR.
-(mouths)

01:07.568 --> 01:09.268
WHAT UP, LOSERS?

01:11.405 --> 01:14.273
NO, NO, NO!

01:14.275 --> 01:16.241
WHO'S GONNA BE
MY TEACHER?

01:16.243 --> 01:18.310
YOUR TEACHER?
WHOEVER LOSES.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.481
-I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
-I'M TELLING YOU, GIRLS,

01:22.483 --> 01:23.982
I'M GONNA BE
TEACHING YOUR LIVES

01:23.984 --> 01:25.918
TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP
OF STUDENTS!

01:25.920 --> 01:27.719
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

01:27.721 --> 01:29.455
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
WE'RE STARTING OFF
THE NEW YEAR

01:29.457 --> 01:31.356
WITHOUT FIRST
TALKING ABOUT HOW WHEN
WE WERE ON THE SUBWAY

01:31.358 --> 01:32.791
-AND YOU TOOK LUCAS
BY THE FACE--
-(laughs)

01:32.793 --> 01:35.894
WE... ARE NOT
TALKING ABOUT THAT!

01:35.896 --> 01:37.729
WE'RE KINGS.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.731
WE'RE KINGS, MATTHEWS.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.333
YOU DON'T GET TO TELL US
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.768
-GET OUT.
-OKAY, BUT THAT WAS
THE LAST ONE.

01:42.770 --> 01:47.873
DAD, YOU HAVE TO LET US LEARN
HOW TO WALK THROUGH LIFE
ON OUR OWN TWO FEET.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.413
HMM, YOU THINK
THEY'LL BE BACK?

01:54.415 --> 01:56.949
NO, I THINK
THEY'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.918
Maya and Riley:
OW. OW. OW. OW.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.653
AH.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.533
HEY, LOOK AT YOUR FEET.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.969
EYES UP HERE, BUDDY.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.440
HEY, RILEY, YOUR DAD
GONNA BE OUR TEACHER

02:21.442 --> 02:23.742
-HE SAID HE'S NOT.
-I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN
I DON'T SEE IT.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.082
-OH, HI.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.580
-I CAN'T LOOK.
-SCARED.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.483
(sighs) OKAY.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.851
-READY?
-QUICK PEEK.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.586
ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.591
-DID YOU SEE WHAT I SAW?
-OH YEAH.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.893
-THEN WHY ARE
WE COVERING OUR EYES?
-BECAUSE IT'S GONNA GO AWAY,

03:14.895 --> 03:16.828
I DON'T WANT IT TO GO AWAY,
AND IT'S GONNA GO AWAY.

03:20.568 --> 03:25.837
Y-Y-Y-Y-AY!

03:25.839 --> 03:28.407
THANK YOU.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.452

Y-Y-Y-Y-AY!

03:45.426 --> 03:47.626
THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR BEST YEAR EVER.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.062
LET'S JUST GET UP, GO OVER,
AND LOOK AT HIM UP CLOSE.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.023
YES?

04:01.024 --> 04:02.541
-HE SAID, "YES."
-WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.409
I'M GONNA
TOUCH HIM ON THE FACE.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.549
SIT DOWN!

04:11.919 --> 04:13.952

AS A COUPLE OF GIRLS

04:13.954 --> 04:16.255
WHO ARE USED
TO SPECIAL TREATMENT.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.557
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOUR LAST TEACHER WAS,
BUT I DON'T DO THAT.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.309
FARKLE TIME, SIR?

04:20.310 --> 04:22.060
GO AHEAD, KID.

04:24.932 --> 04:29.534
-NO, THIS IS WHERE
HE TAKES OVER THE CLASS.
-OH. HE TAKES OVER THE CLASS,

04:29.536 --> 04:31.937
YOU JUST TALK
WITHOUT RAISING YOUR HAND,

04:31.939 --> 04:33.572
AND THESE TWO JUST DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT?

04:34.575 --> 04:36.575
-YES?
-PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.579
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANTED TO MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.681
I WANTED TO SHAPE
YOUNG MINDS.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.783
I WANTED

04:44.785 --> 04:47.552

I SAID WHAT I SAID.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.716
(mouths)

06:23.717 --> 06:25.584
SERIOUSLY, MATTHEWS,
HOW'S THIS POSSIBLY HAPPENING?

06:25.586 --> 06:26.941
I LIKE THAT IT'S HAPPENING.

06:26.942 --> 06:28.297
THE OTHER GUY WOULDN'T
GIVE ME FARKLE TIME.

06:28.298 --> 06:29.653
YEAH, HE DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
WHEN WE TALKED.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.857
IT'S TRUE. IT WAS LIKE
HE WANTED TO TALK ALL THE TIME.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.826
I DON'T THINK HE KNEW

06:34.828 --> 06:35.927
THAT HISTORY CLASS IS

06:35.929 --> 06:37.696
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT OUR LIVES.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.666
GALILEO.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.034
EVERYONE BELIEVED
THAT THE SUN REVOLVED
AROUND THE EARTH...

06:44.037 --> 06:45.604
EXCEPT FOR HIM.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.638
EVERYONE THOUGHT THEY WERE

06:46.640 --> 06:47.706
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE

06:47.708 --> 06:48.907
AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE

06:48.909 --> 06:50.041
CIRCLED AROUND THEM.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.077
I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CIRCLES
AROUND ME...

06:52.079 --> 06:53.645
LITTLE TOO CLOSELY.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.680
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK'S
HAPPENING HERE, RILEY?

06:55.682 --> 06:57.249
WE'RE IN THE EIGHTH GRADE NOW.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.350
WE'RE A YEAR OLDER.

06:58.352 --> 06:59.751
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HEAD OFF

06:59.753 --> 07:02.087
-AND EXPLORE WITHOUT YOU.
-OKAY.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.255
AND YOU GUYS THINK
YOU'RE READY?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.690
-BORN READY.
-I'LL GET THERE!

07:06.994 --> 07:08.660
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO,
MATTHEWS?

07:08.662 --> 07:10.695
WE'RE GONNA TRANSFER OUT
OF HERE.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.364
YEAH! YEAH?

07:12.366 --> 07:14.766
-YEAH!
-LUCAS? FARKLE?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.301
I DON'T THINK SO, RILEY.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.804
-I REALLY LIKE HIM.
-I LIKE THE WAY HE TEACHES US,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.639
I LIKE HOW
WE'RE TALKING RIGHT NOW,

07:20.641 --> 07:22.607
AND HE DOESN'T STOP US
WHEN HE COULD IF HE WANTED TO.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.842
(chuckles)

07:25.679 --> 07:28.313
WAIT. WHY DON'T YOU STOP US?

07:29.650 --> 07:30.816
YEAH, THAT'S INTERESTING,
ISN'T IT?

07:31.718 --> 07:33.752
WELL, WE'RE DONE WITH YOU.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.920
THANKS FOR THE LESSONS.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.922
BUY YOURSELF SOMETHING PRETTY.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.060
THANK YOU. OH, YOU'RE GONNA
NEED TRANSFER SLIPS.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.763
I KNEW IT. HE'S GONNA
KEEP US HERE ON A TECHNICALITY.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.700
GO AHEAD. BEAT IT.

07:50.737 --> 07:54.105
LOOK AT US, RILES--
TWO YOUNG, INDEPENDENT WOMEN
TAKING THEIR OWN ROAD,

07:54.107 --> 07:55.874
MAKING THEIR OWN WAY
WITH THEIR GUTS
AND THEIR BRAINS.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.742
NEEDING NOTHING
FROM NOBODY

07:57.744 --> 07:59.211
FROM THIS MOMENT ON!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.147
HERE COMES FUNNY.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.887
Riley and Maya:
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.190
WE THINK WE'RE
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.694
WE THINK EVERYTHING
REVOLVES AROUND US.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.430
WE DEPEND ON THE SUN
FOR LIGHT, FOR WARMTH

08:18.432 --> 08:20.732
EVERY MORNING, EVERY DAY.
AND WHEN IT'S GONE...

08:20.734 --> 08:22.300
WE SLEEP...

08:22.302 --> 08:26.104
TRUSTING THAT IN THE MORNING,
IT WILL ALWAYS COME BACK AGAIN.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.944
AUGGIE.
OH, TOPANGA.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.746
I'M DROPPING OFF
YOUR HELPER FOR THE DAY.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.015
OH, GOOD, BIG,
STRONG MAN.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.717
THAT'S ME!

08:38.719 --> 08:43.088
MRS. SVORSKI USED TO ATTRACT
ALL THE BIG, STRONG MEN.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.223
-YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
-WHAT?

08:45.225 --> 08:48.827
-NO, I'M ASKING.
-(laughs) OKAY.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.830
-OH, TOPANGA.
-YEAH?

08:51.831 --> 08:53.865
WE NEED TALK.
YOU NEED TO SPEND
MORE TIME HERE.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.433
WELL, MRS. SVORSKI,
HOW CAN I DO THAT?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.769
MRS. SVORSKI,

09:03.510 --> 09:05.710
BUT, THIS PLACE HAS

IS TOO LONG, CREAKY.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.283
KNOWS TIME IS UP. DING!

09:11.285 --> 09:14.853

HOW CAN A BAKERY KNOW

09:14.855 --> 09:16.888
IT KNOWS.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.491

09:25.766 --> 09:29.301
-IS MY-KRAINIAN BAKERY.
-(laughing)

09:32.039 --> 09:34.139
IT'S NOT FUNNY ANY MORE.

09:35.108 --> 09:39.077
I KNOW. YOU THINK I NEED
LITTLE POOTCHKIE LIKE YOU
TO TELL ME JOKE ISN'T FUNNY?

09:39.079 --> 09:42.047
IN OLD COUNTRY,
I HAD VARIETY SHOW.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.917
IT WAS CALLED <i> MRS. SVORSKI'S</i>
<i>NOT SO HAPPY HOUR.</i>

09:47.854 --> 09:49.254

09:49.256 --> 09:51.423

BUT, THIS PLACE

10:00.500 --> 10:04.235
REMINDS ME OF SONG I SANG
AT END OF VARIETY SHOW.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.770

10:14.047 --> 10:17.449
OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

10:17.451 --> 10:19.951

SOMEONE TO HELP YOU OUT.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.320
-ALSO, YOU CHANGE

10:22.322 --> 10:24.456
NO, THIS PLACE

10:24.458 --> 10:26.891
NO SUCH THING

10:30.931 --> 10:34.833
WORLD KEEP TURNING.
LIFE GO TO NEXT PEOPLE.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.168
THIS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN GOOD IDEA.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.912
-TRANSFER SLIP! POOM!
-AND POOM!

10:47.914 --> 10:49.881
GREETINGS, NEW CLASSMATES.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.850
RILEY MATTHEWS.
READY TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.386
'SUP? I'M MAYA.
YOU DON'T LOOK ME
IN THE EYES.

10:54.388 --> 10:57.822
YOU TWO ARE LATE.
YOU TWO DON'T TALK.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.491
YOU TWO
SIT THERE AND THERE.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.262
-THERE AND THERE?
-(chuckles) NO, NO,
WE SIT TOGETHER...

11:04.264 --> 11:05.964
IN THE MIDDLE
OF EVERYTHING.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.265
-MOVE!
-(yelps)

11:07.267 --> 11:08.933
BYE-BYE. (sobs)

11:09.970 --> 11:11.503
EXCUSE ME.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.238
WERE YOU TWO TRYING
TO HAVE A MOMENT?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.006
YOU TWO DON'T GET
A MOMENT.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.908
THIS IS NOT
THE <i> YOU TWO SHOW.</i>

11:16.910 --> 11:18.443
WE WERE TOLD IT WAS.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.344
DURING THE GOLD RUSH,

11:53.346 --> 11:55.980
PEOPLE LEFT THE COMFORT
OF THEIR OWN SURROUNDINGS

11:55.982 --> 11:57.882
IN THE HOPE
OF FINDING GREATER RICHES

11:57.884 --> 12:00.618
-IN AN INHOSPITABLE LAND.
-EXCUSE ME.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.954
I WILL NOT WARN YOU AGAIN,
SIDE-PERSON!

12:03.990 --> 12:05.990
(gasps)

12:07.894 --> 12:09.461
YOU TELL HER, MOM.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.565
-YOU FAILED ME.
-HA!

12:13.567 --> 12:16.367
I SAW A GOAT GIVE BIRTH.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.337
-HI.
-HI.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.673
WAIT A MINUTE!

12:21.675 --> 12:24.042
STUDENTS NUMBER SIX AND SEVEN!

12:24.044 --> 12:26.010
-THAT'S US?
-I BELIEVE SO.

12:26.012 --> 12:29.481
-STUDENTS NUMBER SIX AND SEVEN?
-HEY, AT LEAST SHE'S
TALKING TO US.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.283
YES?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.952
GET OUT!

12:36.456 --> 12:38.690
FINE!

12:38.691 --> 12:40.925
WELL, AT LEAST WE GET
A DRAMATIC EXIT!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.995
(footsteps in unison)

12:47.033 --> 12:48.967
OH, COME ON!

12:52.339 --> 12:55.106
HERE'S WHAT'S FUNNY.
IF YOU'RE STANDING
ON THE MOON,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.375
YOU'D THINK THE EARTH
WAS REVOLVING AROUND YOU,

12:57.377 --> 12:59.244
INSTEAD OF
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.113
IT'S REALLY
ALL ABOUT PERSPECTIVE.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.316
IT'S HARD NOT
TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE
THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING...

13:05.318 --> 13:09.287
UNTIL SOMETHING
SHOWS YOU YOU'RE NOT.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.724
<i>OUR TOWN,</i>
BY THORNTON WILDER.
MY FAVORITE PLAY.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.425
YOU CAN'T TEACH ENGLISH.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.730
-IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HISTORY...
-THERE YOU GO.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.100
...OF PEOPLE
JUST LIKE YOU AND ME,

13:22.102 --> 13:25.069
MOSTLY ABOUT NOT TAKING
WHAT WE HAVE FOR GRANTED,

13:25.071 --> 13:28.373
AND A GIRL WHO GETS
A CHANCE TO TAKE ONE LOOK

13:28.375 --> 13:30.141
AT THE LIFE
SHE LEFT BEHIND.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.248
"JUST FOR A MOMENT NOW
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.285
"JUST FOR A MOMENT
WE'RE HAPPY.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.421
"LET'S REALLY LOOK
AT ONE ANOTHER."

13:45.292 --> 13:46.491
HELLO, GIRLS.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.059
YOU'RE BACK?

13:49.029 --> 13:50.428
YES.

13:51.565 --> 13:54.098
-AS BAD AS THIS IS...
-EVERYTHING ELSE IS WORSE.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.035
WELL, WELCOME BACK, LADIES.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.137
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR TODAY'S LESSON.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.707
-DID WE MISS ANYTHING?
-NAH. WE'RE JUST PUTTING
EVERYTHING BACK IN PLACE.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.076
THE REAL LESSON
BEGINS RIGHT...

14:05.078 --> 14:07.045
(snaps) NOW.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.013
(sighs)
FACE IT, WE ARE NEVER
GOING TO ESCAPE HIM.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.049
HE'S EVERYWHERE.
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO BE KINGS OF ANYTHING

14:11.051 --> 14:13.051
-IF EVERYWHERE WE GO...
-WE MIGHT RUN INTO MY--

14:13.053 --> 14:15.053
MOM? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.621
IS MY-KRAINIAN BAKERY.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.057
STILL NOT FUNNY.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.493
NOT FUNNY?
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S NOT FUNNY.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.096
THIS PLACE LOSES $1.50
ON EVERY BULOCHKI.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.198
I BAKE WITH LOVE.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.133
HOW CAN YOU PUT
PRICE ON LOVE?

14:29.135 --> 14:31.069
(chuckles)
WATCH ME.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.671
OOH! KA-CHING!

14:35.442 --> 14:38.209
BAKERY WINDOW.
BAKERY WINDOW RIGHT NOW.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.213
(laughing)
THAT'S NICE.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.449
SO, YOUR DAD'S AT SCHOOL,
YOUR MOM'S AT OUR HANGOUT.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.117
-THAT'S NICE.
-YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.086
INSIDE,
I'M CRYING SO HARD.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.155
AUGGIE,
THIS IS FOR YOU.

14:51.157 --> 14:54.225
IS FLOUR SHAKER
FROM UKRAINE.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.227
ANTIQUE, LIKE ME.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.365
YOU TAKE NOW.
YOU ARE LITTLE BAKER.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.401
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.204
KEEP SAFE,
TREASURE ALWAYS.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.706
VERY IMPORTANT
WHAT IN THERE.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.477
-THANK YOU, MRS. SVORSKI.
-THANK YOU, MRS. SVORSKI.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.580
OH, THANK YOU, TOPANGA...

15:15.582 --> 15:17.248
AND AUGGIE.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.384
I CAN'T ESCAPE THEM, MAYA.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.686
MY-- MY PARENTS
ARE CONSTANTLY CIRCLING ME...

15:21.688 --> 15:23.121
LIKE PLANETS.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.356
HELLO.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.161
RILEY. (chuckles)
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN 20 MINUTES.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.330
DO YOU MISS ME?
'CAUSE I MISSED YOU.

15:32.332 --> 15:36.167
(groans)
AUGGIE, COME HERE.
I MISS YOU TOO, BUD.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.303
MRS. SVORSKI.
I HAVE SOMEONE WHO I THINK

15:38.305 --> 15:40.838
CAN BE THE PERFECT MANAGER
FOR WHEN I CAN'T BE
AT THE BAKERY.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.441
THIS PERSON KNOW WAY
AROUND FOOD GAME?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.877
ABSOLUTELY.
SHE'S ALSO VERY COLORFUL.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.879
SHE REALLY GETS
INTO WHATEVER SHE'S DOING.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.748
-SOUNDS LIKE GOOD WOMAN.
-MMM.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.152
OH! SORRY I'M LATE.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.387
(Ukrainian accent)
MY DONKEY DIED ON WAY HERE.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.508
OH.

16:00.509 --> 16:02.826
SMELLS LIKE BEING BACK
IN KITCHEN IN UKRAINE.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.630
WAITING FOR TATO
TO COME HOME,

16:05.632 --> 16:09.734
HOPING HE HAS NOT LOST
LAST FINGER IN FIELD MOWER.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.470
OH NO, NO, HE DID.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.206
OH, POOR TATO.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.409
HE CAN NEVER WIN
AT "PAPER, ROCK, SCISSORS."

16:19.379 --> 16:21.779
ALWAYS KNOW
ROCK IS COMING.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.918
-ONE...
-Both: TWO, THREE!

16:26.920 --> 16:28.519
ROCK!

16:29.489 --> 16:31.155
I LIKE HER.

16:33.593 --> 16:38.262
-MOM.
-OHH... MAYABUSHKA.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.265
(normal voice)
I AM GONNA BE HERE

16:41.267 --> 16:43.468
ALL THE TIME NOW,
BABY GIRL.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.570
HOW GREAT IS THAT?

16:45.572 --> 16:47.372
(laughing)

16:53.847 --> 16:56.347
MOM...
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.916
DAD, MOM,
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.553
-WE JUST NEED SOME SPACE.
-IT'S LIKE YOU'RE CIRCLING
AROUND US.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.357
I'M SORRY. YOU THINK
WE'RE CIRCLING AROUND YOU?

17:06.359 --> 17:09.193
-YES.
-OH. I SEE.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.562
SO, I GUESS WE'RE
ALL DONE WITH THE PARENTING?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.331
YES, IT SEEMS
WE'RE ALL DONE
WITH THAT PART NOW.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.266
-GOOD JOB, TOPANGA!
-GOOD JOB, COREY!

17:15.268 --> 17:16.968
REMEMBER THAT WHOLE
POTTY-TRAINING THING

17:16.970 --> 17:18.703
THAT WE DID FOR HER?
AND NOW SHE WANTS TO LEAVE?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.371
OH, I LOVED
EVERY MINUTE OF THAT.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.240
GOOD TIMES!

17:22.242 --> 17:24.308
SO, YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.277
OH YEAH, WE UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE A GROWNUP.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.245
-YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW.
-YUP, YOU'RE READY TO MOVE AWAY.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.615
WELL, I MEAN,
I'D LIKE TO STAY
IN MY OWN BEDROOM.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.551
OKAY. YOU'LL JUST
DROP US A LINE WHEN
YOU GET MARRIED AND HAVE KIDS?

17:33.553 --> 17:37.522
(scoffs)
MOM, I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE EVERYWHERE.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.958
OKAY. WELL, WHEN YOU NEED US,
WE'LL BE AT HOME.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.228
AND I'LL BE BACK THERE,
STAYING OUT OF YOUR WAY.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.432
-OKAY.
-GOOD.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.500
SO, NOBODY FEELS BAD
ABOUT THIS?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.335
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.342
SO, YOU ARE HERE NOW?

17:58.344 --> 18:01.345
-I'M HERE NOW.
-GOOD.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.926
READY?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.342
-SO...
-HERE WE ARE.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.544
KINGS.

18:38.985 --> 18:42.420
THE SUN DOESN'T
GO AROUND THE EARTH.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.322
WE'RE THE ONES MOVING.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.657
WE ORBIT THE SUN,
BECAUSE WE NEED IT.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.427
WE NEED ITS LIGHT
AND ITS HEAT,

18:49.429 --> 18:54.332
AND IF IT WASN'T THERE,
WE'D BE DARK AND ALONE.

18:59.339 --> 19:03.074
I WASN'T
IN MRS. SVORSKI'S ORBIT
FOR VERY LONG,

19:03.076 --> 19:07.411
AND I MISSED OUT
ON SOMEONE WONDERFUL.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.614
MY BROTHER KNEW BETTER.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.383
HE WAS HER VERY GOOD FRIEND.

19:22.095 --> 19:26.564
WE THINK THAT WE'RE
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE,

19:26.566 --> 19:28.533
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

19:28.535 --> 19:31.502
WE NEED TO CIRCLE
THE ONES WE LOVE

19:31.504 --> 19:33.371
FOR AS LONG
AS THEY'RE HERE.

19:42.081 --> 19:47.418
WE NEED TO HOLD THEM CLOSE,
BECAUSE NO MATTER
HOW FAR WE TRAVEL,

19:47.420 --> 19:50.955
THEY ARE THE ONES
WHO HOLD US IN PLACE.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.059
IT'S GRAVITY,
AND WITHOUT IT,

19:55.061 --> 19:57.995
WE WOULD JUST
ALL FLOAT AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.402
WE ARE NOT KINGS AT ALL.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.506
WE ARE JUST...
TINY LITTLE SPECKS.

20:08.508 --> 20:13.477

GOOD NIGHT,

20:55.688 --> 20:59.023
-GOOD JOB, RILEY.
-I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
MISS HER, BUDDY.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.559
SHE GAVE ME
HER FLOUR SHAKER.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.428
-THAT'S REALLY NICE.
-(rattles)

21:04.430 --> 21:05.930
WHAT'S INSIDE?

21:09.002 --> 21:12.670
IT'S A NOTE.
MAYBE SHE WROTE YOU A NOTE.

-YOU DOING OKAY?
-YES, COREY.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.162
THAT'S GREAT.
