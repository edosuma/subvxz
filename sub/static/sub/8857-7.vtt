21:17.792 --> 21:19.167
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.833
THIS PROJECT WAS MEANT
AS A COMMEMORATION
OF FRIENDSHIP,

21:21.917 --> 21:24.042
A RETROSPECTIVE
OF DAYS GONE BY.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.583
ADMIT IT.
YOU MADE THAT UP.

21:27.292 --> 21:29.167

AS THOUGH IT WERE TODAY.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.000
Edd:
WELL, HELLO, EDDY.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.417
FASHIONABLY LATE
AS USUAL.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.000

21:56.417 --> 22:00.125
REMEMBER WHEN
YOU USED THAT FISH
TO DUEL WITH ROLF?

22:00.208 --> 22:02.958
NO MORE REMEMBERING!

22:03.042 --> 22:04.208
WOW. LOOKY HERE.

22:04.292 --> 22:07.542
ISN'T THIS ICE PACK
FROM WHEN WE DESTROYED
JONNY'S HOUSE?

22:07.625 --> 22:11.167
QUIT RAKING UP
THE PAST!

22:11.250 --> 22:12.833
FUNNY.
THIS REMINDS ME

22:12.917 --> 22:14.250
OF A NUMBER
OF OCCASIONS

22:14.333 --> 22:15.708
WHERE YOU CHASED--

22:15.792 --> 22:16.500
SHUT UP!

22:16.583 --> 22:19.000

22:19.083 --> 22:22.458
