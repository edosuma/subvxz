00:01.869 --> 00:04.072
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
America was obsessed
with running.

00:04.138 --> 00:07.175
From Flo Jo and Carl Lewis
to Chariots of Fire,

00:07.241 --> 00:09.410
from this running man
to this running man,

00:09.477 --> 00:11.779
everyone was feeling
that runner's high.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.047
Well, everyone except me.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.282
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Come Friday,

00:14.348 --> 00:17.451
all of you will be doing
the state-mandated mile run.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.153
Here's how it works.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.722
You run a mile,
I time you,

00:21.789 --> 00:26.394
then I inform the state
of how alarmingly inert
the modern child has become.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.728
Question.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.364
Why is the state so determined
to make us move our bodies?

00:30.431 --> 00:31.799
Yeah, why focus on us?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.867
It's like
what are they running from?

00:33.934 --> 00:35.703
This run
is not up for debate.

00:35.769 --> 00:39.307
It is law written clear as day
in the state's constitution.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.909
Balls. You've won this round,
Pennsylvania,

00:41.975 --> 00:45.379
but you've messed with
the wrong inactive citizen.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.447
What?

00:46.514 --> 00:47.915
How can they
force you to run

00:47.981 --> 00:49.750
when your bones
are still growing?

00:49.817 --> 00:51.919
Excessive movement
stunts your growth.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.621
That's what I said!

00:53.687 --> 00:56.824
Well, don't you worry,
because mama
will run a million miles

00:56.890 --> 00:59.059
to help her baby
not run one.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.861
Just for that,
I'm handing out free sugar.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.130
Get in here
and grab a lump.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.264
Ooh!

01:03.331 --> 01:05.766
You love it.
You love it.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.168
"Still growing"?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.269
That's your excuse?

01:08.336 --> 01:09.470
Yeah,
it's a super bummer,

01:09.537 --> 01:11.472
but what are you gonna do?
A note's a note.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.675
I didn't think
your mother could top
"preparing for a haircut."

01:14.742 --> 01:16.510
I didn't, either.
I was impressed, too.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.846
Shame on you.
What would William Penn
himself say

01:18.912 --> 01:20.448
if he was standing here
right now?

01:20.514 --> 01:22.416
"Why aren't you all
working the fields?
Winter is coming."

01:22.483 --> 01:24.852
Indeed, he would be mystified
by our modern world,

01:24.918 --> 01:26.854
but he'd also be very
disappointed in you.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.923
I can live with that.
Well, looks like Goldfarb

01:29.990 --> 01:31.692
will not be joining you
in the mile run.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.860
So lame!
What a weenie!

01:32.926 --> 01:34.328
You suck, Goldnerd!

01:34.395 --> 01:35.829
Pfft. I can live with that,
as well.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.465
The good news is,
the note says

01:37.531 --> 01:39.433
nothing about him
playing goalie,

01:39.500 --> 01:42.102
which is what
he's going to do right now.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.537
Fire away!

01:43.604 --> 01:45.339
Oh, stop!
I'm still growing!

01:45.406 --> 01:47.441
Re... Read the note!
Read the note!

01:49.210 --> 01:51.111
* I'm twisted up inside

01:51.179 --> 01:54.748
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:57.351 --> 01:58.819
* I don't know the future

01:58.886 --> 02:02.456
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:02.523 --> 02:05.493
ADULT ADAM:
It was January 16th,
1980-something.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.795
Lainey Lewis had left
to pursue her dreams.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.730
But back home,
it wasn't so dreamy.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.632
BARRY: I can't believe
she actually left.

02:11.699 --> 02:12.800
I know!

02:12.866 --> 02:14.968
How could Lainey
just ditch our band?

02:15.035 --> 02:17.205
Now it's just me and my
rhythm-challenged drummer.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.339
I agree.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.740
Lainey's talent
made up for my lack of skill,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.542
and now
I'm totally exposed.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.910
You think you miss her?

02:22.976 --> 02:25.313
My baby girl left me
in an empty nest.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.382
Who's gonna make sure
I have towels? Who?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.484
The JTP's heartbroken,
too, bro.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.085
ALL: JTP.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.188
I just don't know
when the achy feeling
in my heart place

02:34.255 --> 02:35.423
is gonna go away.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.157
Soon enough, pal.
Just take it day by day.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.759
Don't say "day."

02:38.826 --> 02:40.928
Days are how Lainey measured
the passing of time.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.364
Isn't that how everyone
measures the passing of time?

02:43.431 --> 02:45.266
You knew her so well, Andrew.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.501
Thank you for understanding
my pain,

02:47.568 --> 02:49.270
even though you have
a tiny peanut heart

02:49.337 --> 02:51.772
like a little hummingbird.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.542
Okay, it's
a normal-sized heart, but...

02:54.608 --> 02:56.244
Bevy, how much longer
is this gonna go on?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.911
I want my den back.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.382
Our babies are devastated,
and all you can think about
is your stupid den?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.717
That's where the TV is.
That's my baby.

03:03.784 --> 03:07.355
Ugh, I can't stand
to see their precious hearts
hurting this much.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.556
I have to fix this.
No.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.124
Do not try and fix
their feelings. I mean it.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.627
But that's a mama's job,
to fix everything

03:13.694 --> 03:15.629
so they never learn pain
or sadness.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.964
It's very healthy.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.432
No, it's not.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.402
You soak up all their misery
like a sadness sponge,

03:21.469 --> 03:22.636
and then you're a wreck.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.771
It only makes things worse.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.573
Not this time.
(SIGHS)

03:25.639 --> 03:28.208
Those little pickles
need someone to be their rock,

03:28.276 --> 03:31.245
and damn it,
that someone is me.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.815
(CRYING)

03:34.882 --> 03:38.452
Your pain is overwhelming
all my senses!

03:38.519 --> 03:39.787
(CRYING CONTINUES)

03:39.853 --> 03:40.954
Hey, Mr. G.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.189
I made everyone
a nice chamomile tea.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.325
You want a mug?
You're such a... (BLEEP)

03:44.392 --> 03:45.426
Great.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.961
(CRYING)
Come into the mom cocoon!

03:48.028 --> 03:51.164
I'll snug you until you emerge
happy butterflies!

03:51.231 --> 03:53.834
(CRYING) This is obviously
our worst and only option!

03:53.901 --> 03:55.936
(ALL CRYING)
Yes, it is.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.971
Is it me, or is she
making them sadder?

03:58.038 --> 03:59.507
For once, it's not you.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.742
It's up to us to help
those morons move on.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.744
Sounds like
you're including me
in a plan to save your family.

04:03.811 --> 04:04.812
I'm honored, sir!

04:04.878 --> 04:06.514
Why ya gotta make
everything so stupid?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.148
That's on me...
Partner.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.587
Okay, after doing
lots of research

04:13.654 --> 04:15.456
in psychology
and behavioral science,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.725
I have compiled a list of ways
to make everyone feel better.

04:18.859 --> 04:19.860
This is stupid.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.629
I know how
to cheer up kids.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.996
They need four things.

04:23.063 --> 04:26.099
Stuff, sandwiches,
songs, Sixers.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.602
This took me like eight hours,
but let's hear your thing.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.203
First I buy 'em stuff.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.939
Stuff makes 'em happy.
Uh-huh.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.174
Then I take them to
the drive-thru at Arby's.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.643
Kids love Arby's.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.811
They got roast beef.
Yeah, no,
I've been to Arby's.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.281
Then we drive around,
and I play happy songs
to make 'em happy.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.283
And then?
Then I got Sixers tickets

04:43.351 --> 04:45.185
'cause nothing
makes people happier

04:45.252 --> 04:47.287
than watching Dr. J
dunk on the Knicks!

04:47.355 --> 04:48.556
And then?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.058
Then you go home happy
and you stay that way!

04:51.124 --> 04:52.560
Okay, uh,
devil's advocate?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.328
Uh, maybe all that stuff
has worked in the past,

04:54.395 --> 04:56.830
but I'm not sure
how slam dunks
are gonna solve this.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.867
Devil's advocate
to your devil's advocate,
shut up.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.201
We're doing your thing.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.737
(BELL RINGS)

05:03.804 --> 05:06.674
That's class!
Enjoy the mile run, suckas!

05:06.740 --> 05:09.877
Looks like we'll be chillin'
right here with you, sucka.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.380
We forced our moms
to write us notes, too.
What?

05:12.446 --> 05:13.981
"My son has
water on the knee

05:14.047 --> 05:16.517
and cannot run, jog,
or trot."

05:16.584 --> 05:17.885
Don't you dare
hand that in!

05:17.951 --> 05:20.187
"Daniel Morse is suffering
from puberty pains."

05:20.253 --> 05:21.855
Obviously you are,
but still!

05:21.922 --> 05:24.157
"Dave Kim has
'The Andromeda Strain'."

05:24.224 --> 05:26.994
Come on!
We can't all lie
about our feeble bodies.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.429
Mellor will see
right through it.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.697
Damn it. He's right.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.565
Gym is pointless,
and so is Mellor.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.367
All he does is push us
out of our comfort zone.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.102
The zone I love being in!

05:35.168 --> 05:37.705
Sometimes I wish he would just
go away and leave us alone.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.272
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

05:39.339 --> 05:41.409
Ladies and gentlemen,
I stand before you
with heavy heart

05:41.475 --> 05:44.344
and wildly jacked delts
to announce

05:44.412 --> 05:46.313
that I am leaving
William Penn Academy.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.315
What?

05:48.382 --> 05:50.217
The truth is,
I've been offered my dream job

05:50.283 --> 05:53.020
coaching the country's
best wrestlers
for the Olympics.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.254
Wow. Where?

05:54.321 --> 05:56.390
Just 30 minutes away
at the Foxcatcher Farm,

05:56.457 --> 05:59.593
owned by the wild-eyed
eccentric billionaire
John du Pont.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.695
But why would a billionaire
want to coach wrestlers?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.297
Hard to say.
He's an intense fella.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.299
Either way, it's
an opportunity of a lifetime

06:06.366 --> 06:07.968
with zero chance
of ending badly.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.570
Proud of you, coach.
You're the man.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.871
We'll miss you every day.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.406
Yeah, big blow.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.042
Point of procedure,
what happens
with the mile run?

06:15.108 --> 06:17.277
The mile run
is hereby postponed

06:17.344 --> 06:21.949
until the school can find
a suitable,
inferior replacement for me.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.150
(VOICE BREAKING)
Damn it, Rick,

06:23.216 --> 06:24.652
you said you wouldn't let
your eyes sweat.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.821
Walk it off, big guy!

06:27.888 --> 06:30.057
Let's go maximize
what little time
we have left with him!

06:32.025 --> 06:33.393
Yes, oh, yeah, yeah!

06:33.461 --> 06:34.995
Such a bummer, guys!

06:35.062 --> 06:37.064
We feel so bad.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.932
(WHISPERING)
Mellor's gone!

06:38.999 --> 06:41.435
(ALL QUIETLY CHANTING
"MELLOR'S GONE!")

06:41.502 --> 06:44.972
(CHANTING GROWS LOUDER)

06:47.007 --> 06:48.776
ADULT ADAM:
While we were happy
Coach was leaving,

06:48.842 --> 06:51.579
my mom took a stab at curing
everyone's depression.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.080
That's right.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.583
Focus on the fudge
and not the fact that

06:55.649 --> 06:59.086
you may never have
love, music,
or a daughter ever again.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.387
Oh, damn it.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.956
She's pouring a gallon
of sadness on their fire.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.257
We gotta get rid of her.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.426
Got it. But how?

07:06.494 --> 07:08.762
I'll take care of it,
and I'm sorry.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.097
Hey, Bevy!

07:10.163 --> 07:12.332
The boy here needs
his sweater bedazzled,

07:12.399 --> 07:14.535
and he said
you wouldn't be good at it.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.037
Geoff Schwartz,
let's go! Move!

07:17.104 --> 07:18.706
All right,
you sad sacks.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.907
Enough moping.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.476
It's time to get out
for a day of dad fun.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.977
Pass!
(MUFFLED) Please, just go,

07:24.044 --> 07:25.378
and let us be miserable
in peace.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.315
Why be miserable here
when you can go out

07:28.381 --> 07:31.151
and listen to your
brand-new car stereo!

07:31.218 --> 07:32.853
What?
No way!

07:32.920 --> 07:36.557
Mur! This is the fancy kind
where you pop off the face
and take it with you,

07:36.624 --> 07:39.126
and then car thieves
are like, "What?"

07:39.192 --> 07:40.494
MURRAY: And that's not all.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.962
You know what's
in that car stereo?

07:42.029 --> 07:43.631
Is that a compact disc?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.799
You said this family fully
invested in the cassette

07:45.866 --> 07:47.535
and there were no new formats
we'd ever need!

07:47.601 --> 07:51.304
So what do you say
we drive around,
listen to music,

07:51.371 --> 07:53.707
and eat some of
our favorite meats!

07:53.774 --> 07:55.843
That's right!
We're going to Arby's!

07:55.909 --> 07:57.344
But that's
top-shelf fast food!

07:57.410 --> 07:59.747
We only get that as a treat
after we go to the dentist.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.914
Their fries are curly!

08:00.981 --> 08:02.550
That's a special-occasions
potato.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.984
And that's just the start.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.920
I also got us tickets
to the 76ers game!

08:06.987 --> 08:08.321
No way!

08:08.388 --> 08:09.923
Hey, feels good to stand.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.925
Why don't you put
on some clothes,
and we'll head on out?

08:13.460 --> 08:17.097
Ah, look who's
a big, sparkly man!

08:17.164 --> 08:18.532
It's me.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.901
Damn it, Schwartz.
(QUIETLY) I told you
to keep her occupied.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.536
I tried!
She bedazzles like the wind!

08:22.603 --> 08:24.204
I didn't even have
to take the sweater off!

08:24.271 --> 08:26.840
ADULT ADAM: And so my dad
piled everyone in the car,

08:26.907 --> 08:29.209
dead set on lifting
their spirits.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.277
On, off.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.213
On, off, on, off!

08:33.280 --> 08:36.216
Stereo bandits
have met their match!

08:36.283 --> 08:38.351
Well, Bill's happy.
What about the rest of you?

08:38.418 --> 08:39.519
My life is garbage.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.254
Lainey would throw stuff
in the garbage.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.024
That was her thing...
When she had trash.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.359
Murray, just turn
the car around
and take us home.

08:46.426 --> 08:49.129
No! We're going
to the Sixers game,
and we're gonna be happy!

08:49.196 --> 08:52.032
Here, listen
to this music disc
and smile, damn it!

08:52.099 --> 08:54.467
* If you like pina coladas *
God, turn it off!

08:54.534 --> 08:57.137
These joyful words
just remind me
of my own misery.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.039
Hey, what's going on
up there?
I hear shouting!

08:59.106 --> 09:01.208
It's like the song
is rubbing its happiness

09:01.274 --> 09:02.610
into our sad faces!

09:02.676 --> 09:03.777
Stop pushing buttons!

09:03.844 --> 09:04.912
You're just fast-forwarding
the song!

09:04.978 --> 09:07.114
We need it
to make you happy!

09:07.180 --> 09:09.116
(GRUNTS)
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.417
(GROANS)
Murray,

09:10.483 --> 09:12.252
I think the kids broke
the stereo's face.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.087
Relax,
it just clicks back...

09:14.154 --> 09:15.823
Oh, no,
it's not clicking back on.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.090
BARRY: Give it to me!

09:17.157 --> 09:18.558
I'll align the delicate
components with force!

09:18.626 --> 09:20.293
Just turn it off, Murray!

09:20.360 --> 09:23.496
I can't!
It's now a stereo
without buttons!

09:23.563 --> 09:25.065
We'll just wait
for the song to end!

09:25.132 --> 09:28.135
* Come with me and escape *

(RUPERT HOLMES' ESCAPE
(THE PINA COLADA SONG) PLAYS)
BARRY: Oh, my God.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.010
What's happening?
It started over.
It's on repeat!

09:37.077 --> 09:38.679
It's just gonna play
over and over!
* If you like pina coladas *

09:38.746 --> 09:39.980
We're stuck
in a happy loop!

09:40.047 --> 09:41.949
I don't feel happy!
I feel anger!

09:42.015 --> 09:44.417
My anger is growing!
GEOFF: I don't know how much
longer I can roll around...

09:44.484 --> 09:47.520
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, my dad's happy plan
just turned everyone angry.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.757
Meanwhile, Coach Mellor's plan
was to find his replacement.

09:49.823 --> 09:53.593
After an extensive search,
I'd like you all
to meet Neelo Green.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.595
Sup.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.664
ALL: Sup.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.165
Take it away,
Coach Green.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.200
Layups, two lines.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.369
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

10:05.005 --> 10:06.073
Y'all terrible!

10:07.040 --> 10:09.176
All day long!

10:09.843 --> 10:11.444
Terrible.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.747
You sure about this guy?
He seems a little bonkers.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.783
Hey, every coach
has his methods.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.685
Sometimes the crazier
the better.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.187
In my gym,
we got two rules.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.155
Number one,
we never give up!

10:22.222 --> 10:23.623
We're on the same page.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.792
Number two,

10:24.858 --> 10:27.527
aliens are real
and they walk among us!

10:27.594 --> 10:28.896
Different page...

10:28.962 --> 10:30.497
Now I want to see
some squats!

10:30.563 --> 10:31.899
Back on track.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.302
When the invasion happens,
you will be probed.

10:35.368 --> 10:39.406
And trust me, you do
not want to be probed.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.009
It is very unpleasant!

10:42.075 --> 10:44.011
Okay, we're gonna
keep on looking.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.481
(HORNS HONKING)
ADULT ADAM:
It was hour three in the car,

10:48.548 --> 10:51.551
and my dad's plan
to cheer everyone up
was at a dead standstill.

10:51.618 --> 10:55.022
* If you like pina coladas *
No, I do not like
pina coladas! I hate them!

10:55.088 --> 10:56.656
I hate
all frozen beverages!

10:56.724 --> 10:57.925
I'm unraveling!

10:57.991 --> 11:01.061
Oh, no, Barry's unraveling!
Oh, don't unravel, boofie.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.495
Just ignore the song.

11:02.562 --> 11:05.866
I can't! My only thoughts
are these delightful lyrics!

11:05.933 --> 11:07.768
Just drive the car, Murray!
Punch it!

11:07.835 --> 11:09.102
Drive anywhere!

11:09.169 --> 11:10.370
I can't!

11:10.437 --> 11:12.706
There's construction
up and down 95!

11:12.773 --> 11:14.607
There's no way out!

11:14.674 --> 11:15.843

Could it be?

11:21.248 --> 11:23.851
(RUPERT HOLMES' ESCAPE
(THE PINA COLADA SONG) PLAYS)
Nope! Can't do it!

11:23.917 --> 11:26.086
Bill, no!
We're on the expressway!

11:26.153 --> 11:28.856
I hate you all!

(BILL GRUNTS)

11:35.528 --> 11:36.964
Good news, class!

11:37.030 --> 11:38.899
After a pretty big
false start,

11:38.966 --> 11:42.369
I finally found a perfect
replacement for Coach Mellor!

11:42.435 --> 11:44.537
My brother!
Coach Mellor!

11:48.341 --> 11:49.609
Oh, balls.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.178
What is that giant man
doing here?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.479
He coaches college football!

11:52.545 --> 11:53.847
Not anymore.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.984
After my mutual decision
to be fired from Villanova,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.186
I decided to be a more...

11:59.252 --> 12:01.288
Caring and sensitive coach.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.623
I guess you could say
I've Mellor'd out.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.993
(LAUGHS) Nice.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.895
Gentle? Playful puns?

12:07.961 --> 12:09.296
I'm digging this guy.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.999
Look, I know you guys got
the mile run you got to do,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.101
but I say, no more.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.903
In fact,
if there's anybody

12:15.969 --> 12:17.670
that would prefer
to be elsewhere,

12:17.737 --> 12:21.741
like computer lab
or theater practice,
just go.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.710
I believe people
should follow their dreams.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.314
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Busted!

12:27.380 --> 12:29.349
Now I know who doesn't
wanna be here!

12:29.416 --> 12:30.818
Oh, no!
It was a trap!

12:30.884 --> 12:32.319
And we were
immediately exposed!

12:32.385 --> 12:34.822
The mile run
is back on.

12:34.888 --> 12:35.956
Move!

12:38.158 --> 12:39.759
I'm sorry I fell!

12:39.827 --> 12:42.262
Don't eat me!

12:42.329 --> 12:45.298
(VOICE BREAKING) I'm just
so glad to see this job
is staying in the family.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.366
Ow.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.935
ADULT ADAM: We were doomed.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.803
I had to make sure original
Coach Mellor never left us,

12:49.870 --> 12:51.204
and I wouldn't take no
for an answer.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.106
No.
Come on, man!

12:53.173 --> 12:55.475
I suddenly recognize
you have value.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.477
Just because me and Nick
have different methods,

12:57.544 --> 12:59.712
doesn't mean his is wrong.
Sure it does!

12:59.779 --> 13:02.649
The point is,
we're both trying to teach you
the same thing,

13:02.715 --> 13:05.185
to be a winner,
not a Rosie Ruiz.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.286
A Rosie Who-now?

13:06.353 --> 13:07.354
Okay, Goldfarb.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.689
One last lesson
before I go...

13:09.756 --> 13:11.825
ADULT ADAM: That lesson
was about Rosie Ruiz,

13:11.892 --> 13:13.693
a world-class runner
in the '80s,

13:13.760 --> 13:15.896
famous for winning
the Boston Marathon

13:15.963 --> 13:17.430
by taking the subway.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.798
REPORTER: Rosie,
have you been doing
a lot of heavy intervals?

13:18.866 --> 13:20.200
Um, someone else
asked me that,

13:20.267 --> 13:21.534
and I'm not sure
what intervals are.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.471
This woman cheated
to win the Boston Marathon?

13:24.537 --> 13:26.206
And no one noticed?
Nope.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.875
Everybody was too caught up
in the excitement

13:27.941 --> 13:30.510
that an unfit woman who knew
nothing about the sport

13:30.577 --> 13:34.214
didn't even break a sweat
while shattering
a world record.

13:34.281 --> 13:37.817
Wow.
That is so wrong.
Yeah.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.054
She took the subway?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.422
The subway!

13:42.489 --> 13:44.992
Everyone has a sports hero,
and Rosie Ruiz is mine.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.094
Controversial, but okay.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.162
That's why
during the mile run,
I'll jump into your car,

13:49.229 --> 13:50.597
and you can drive me
to the finish line?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.900
Aw, kiddo.
I... I can't help you.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.167
'Cause cheating
is wrong?

13:54.234 --> 13:57.237
No! Cheating's that rush
that keeps me ticking.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.772
I can't help you
'cause I don't have a license.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.241
You're really gonna
let the state

14:01.308 --> 14:02.842
tell you you can't drive?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.912
The same state that says
I have to run a mile?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.446
But you can run a mile.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.115
And you can drive a mile.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.751
That I can.
Screw the state, I'm in!

14:11.818 --> 14:13.253
ADULT ADAM:
Just like Rosie Ruiz,

14:13.320 --> 14:15.455
I would cheat my way
out of the mile run.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.557
All I needed
was the perfect excuse.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.827
You guys go ahead!
I'm getting a cramp
in my running muscles!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.733
Hey, what's
Goldberg doing?

14:26.799 --> 14:29.369
Cheating! How dare he!

14:29.436 --> 14:31.138
And I want in.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.239
ADAM: Punch it, Pops!

14:32.305 --> 14:34.807
I think your friends
are on to us.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.643
Let us in on this
or we're ratting you out.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.745
Fine!
We'll do a group Rosie Ruiz.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.148
Who's that?
My sports hero, just get in.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.352
My God!

14:45.418 --> 14:47.254
You kids broke
the five-minute mark!

14:47.320 --> 14:49.990
Who knew we had Olympic-level
runners in our midst!

14:50.057 --> 14:51.724
Now we can take State!

14:51.791 --> 14:53.026
Are you kidding me
with this?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.395
I told you
not to be Rosie Ruiz!

14:55.462 --> 14:57.764
In my defense,
I didn't know you'd be here!

14:57.830 --> 14:59.132
You cheated.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.300
NICK: Is that the thing
you learned from me?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.634
Why does it even matter?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.937
We're not
your star athletes.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.738
You won't even remember us
in 20 years.

15:05.805 --> 15:06.940
COACH MELLOR: Is that right?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.241
You think
I taught at this school

15:08.308 --> 15:10.143
for the Ruben Amaro Jrs.
of this world?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.579
Being that he's gonna be
a major-league player, yeah?

15:12.645 --> 15:14.647
Okay, fine.
He's a nice perk.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.583
But the real reason
I do this job

15:16.649 --> 15:19.386
is to help kids who hate gym
believe in themselves.

15:20.853 --> 15:24.124
Guess I inspired you
to be nothing.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.993
ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
pulling a Rosie Ruiz

15:26.059 --> 15:27.860
was a real disappointment
for Coach.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.298
And for my family,
things were even less rosy.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.934
* Yes, I like pina coladas

15:35.002 --> 15:38.005
* And getting caught
in the rain *

15:38.071 --> 15:39.606
I don't really hear
the song anymore.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.941
It's become a part of me.
BARRY: Oh, my God!

15:42.009 --> 15:44.377
I've gone from loving the song
to hating it,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.646
but now I kinda respect
and enjoy it,

15:46.713 --> 15:48.115
but also fear it!

15:48.181 --> 15:50.550
No, don't give into
the pina colada, man!
You gotta fight it!

15:50.617 --> 15:52.185
Fine! Let's go home!

15:52.252 --> 15:53.320
Screw it! We'll do it!

15:53.386 --> 15:54.921
I'll break all the laws
to get there!

15:54.988 --> 15:56.223
BARRY: Good!
ERICA: Let's do it!

15:56.289 --> 15:58.825
BEVERLY: Oh, Murray, Murray!
There's a cop!

15:58.891 --> 15:59.892
I see the cop!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.228
Maybe he hasn't seen us!

16:01.294 --> 16:02.662
He's looking right at us!

16:02.729 --> 16:04.231
Well, act casual!
Don't look at him!

16:04.297 --> 16:05.498
Aw, damn it! I looked!

16:05.565 --> 16:08.701
Oh, no, we're making
direct eye contact!

16:08.768 --> 16:10.003
License and registration.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.138
What?

16:11.204 --> 16:13.473
Turn off
the pina-colada song, sir!

16:13.540 --> 16:15.908
What?
Just get out of the car.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.910
We're gonna
get out of the car now

16:17.977 --> 16:19.846
because we can't hear you!

16:19.912 --> 16:22.982
I'm giving you a ticket
for riding
in the breakdown lane.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.717
Well, my family's
having a breakdown.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.918
Doesn't that count
for something?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.487
It does not.
(SCOFFS)

16:27.554 --> 16:30.890
Great!
He's writing me a ticket.
Are you happy?

16:30.957 --> 16:32.525
No!
We didn't want
any of this, Dad!

16:32.592 --> 16:34.227
Yeah, they were
perfectly fine at home

16:34.294 --> 16:35.928
in their warm mom cocoon!

16:35.995 --> 16:38.598
Fine! You wanna mope around
for the rest of your lives,

16:38.665 --> 16:39.832
mope away!

16:39.899 --> 16:41.701
Please, you didn't do
any of this for them.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.370
All you wanted
was peace and quiet

16:43.436 --> 16:45.672
so you could watch TV again.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.307
You think
I don't miss Lainey?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.277
I watched that girl
grow up.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.878
She's like a daughter to me.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.613
But I can't ever say that

16:53.680 --> 16:56.249
because I'm supposed
to be the strong one
for this family,

16:56.316 --> 16:59.086
who's never allowed
to feel sad.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.221
And that makes it hurt
even worse.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.528
ADULT ADAM:
My dad's plan to cheer up
the family had backfired,

17:08.595 --> 17:10.530
and now he was sadder
than anyone.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.639
Stop looking at me!
I'm fine.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.441
In all fairness,
it's hard to look away

17:21.508 --> 17:23.976
knowing you're
all mushy inside
and missing Lainey, too.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.079
I thought you only get sad
when the Eagles lose.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.814
I do! Now drop it, okay?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.182
You want a huggy?
No!

17:29.249 --> 17:30.783
How about laying on
some warm laundry?

17:30.850 --> 17:32.319
What am I, a cat? No.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.487
Do you want
my garlic bread?
No.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.622
Y... Yes.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.124
But other than garlic bread,
I'm fine!

17:37.190 --> 17:39.426
Let's just eat
and feel nothing.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.462
ADULT ADAM:
Unfortunately, the silence
only made everyone's mind

17:42.529 --> 17:44.764
wander back to
an unlikely little ditty

17:44.831 --> 17:47.100
about a frozen island drink.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.902
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.472
Oh, no.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.507
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.143
Don't!
I just got it out of my head!

17:57.110 --> 17:59.812
* If you like pina coladas

17:59.879 --> 18:01.148
I really don't.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.682
BOTH:
* And getting caught
in the rain

18:02.749 --> 18:04.151
No one wants to be wet!

18:04.217 --> 18:06.052
* If you're not into yoga

18:06.119 --> 18:07.254
I'm not
into any of this!

18:07.320 --> 18:08.955
BOTH:
* If you have half a brain

18:09.021 --> 18:10.357
You have half a brain,
morons!

18:10.423 --> 18:12.392
* If you love making love
at midnight

18:12.459 --> 18:14.261
Midnight?
That's a whole new day.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.663
BOTH:
* In the dunes of the cape

18:16.729 --> 18:19.299
I hate that we all know
the words to this song.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.701
ALL: * I'm the love
that you've looked for

18:21.768 --> 18:23.803
* Write to me and escape

18:26.573 --> 18:27.840
I like pina coladas.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.242
(STRAINING) And?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.346
And... Getting caught
in the rain.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.048
ALL: * I got to meet you
by tomorrow noon

18:36.115 --> 18:37.550
Aw, damn it, it's working!

18:37.617 --> 18:38.918
ALL:
* Through all this red tape

18:38.985 --> 18:40.820
MURRAY: I feel happy.
This is terrible.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.322
ADULT ADAM:
As unlikely as it seemed,

18:42.389 --> 18:44.824
my dad's plan
saved our family.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.893
And for the first time
since Lainey left,

18:46.959 --> 18:48.961
things didn't feel so sad.
* Yes, I like pina coladas *

18:49.028 --> 18:50.497
Even better, our dad learned

18:50.563 --> 18:53.300
he didn't always have to be
the strong one.

18:53.366 --> 18:57.237
And even though my family
never may have made it
to the Sixers game in person,

18:57.304 --> 18:59.672
they did get to watch
Charles Barkley

18:59.739 --> 19:02.342
dominate on the court
together.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.378
As for me and my friends,
we finally ran our first mile.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.047
And, yeah, it was probably
the slowest mile
in school history,

19:08.114 --> 19:09.882
but thanks
to some great coaching,

19:09.949 --> 19:12.018
we pushed ourselves,
didn't give up,

19:12.084 --> 19:13.753
and made it
across that finish line.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.357
And... Eighteen minutes
and 27 seconds.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.025
Now, that I believe.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.993
Did we pass?
Congrats.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.630
Thanks, Coach.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.698
Don't thank me.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.867
Truth is,
I was gonna let you bail,

19:27.934 --> 19:29.802
but Rick said
you had it in you.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.106
Your brother really
is one hell of a coach.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.075
Maybe that's something
you ought to let him know.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.511
* I knew her smile
in an instant

19:38.578 --> 19:41.648
* I knew the curve
of her face *

19:42.282 --> 19:43.616
Coach, wait.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.118
I ran the mile.
For real.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.954
I didn't doubt you
for a second.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.357
Before you go...

19:50.423 --> 19:52.759
I want you to know
how much you taught me.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.193
Well, that's nice to say.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.528
But it's true.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.964
You taught me to give 110%,

19:58.030 --> 20:00.800
and that rubbing dirt
on a bruise will cure it.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.201
But most of all,

20:02.269 --> 20:05.572
you taught all the kids
like me to never give up.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.374
Just doing my job,
Goldberg.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.910
Hey, you got my name right.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.279
Only 'cause
you've earned it.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.951
ADULT ADAM: Back then,
Coach Mellor always said

20:19.018 --> 20:21.120
one day I would come
to appreciate him.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.956
Turns out, that day came
when he made me run that mile.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.259
And it continues even now.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.095
All you need in life
is a good coach
to remind you that

20:29.161 --> 20:31.598
it's not about just making it
to the finish line.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.733
It's about what it takes
to get there.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.404
* Come with me and escape *

20:41.641 --> 20:44.143
The, uh, first award that we
have is the coach's award.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.278
(BELL DINGS)

20:50.517 --> 20:53.820
What can I say?
I will always love you.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.855
Dude, you got to stop this.

20:55.922 --> 20:56.989
You're just hurting yourself.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.525
Trust me.
You're gonna be fine.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.959
Don't say "fine."

21:00.026 --> 21:01.160
Lainey was fine.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.962
That was her thing,
being fine.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.131
Okay, we got to cheer you up.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.966
How about we go play smashball
at the Wawa?

21:07.033 --> 21:10.169
(SIGHS) Lainey used
to go to the Wawa.
That was her thing.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.439
We could go toilet-paper
Principal Ball's house.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.342
Lainey used to use
toilet paper.
That was her thing.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.676
Okay...

21:16.743 --> 21:19.779
Oh! I know how to prove
you can find love again.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.381
We can watch a teen rom com.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.483
(CRYING) Lainey used to love
teen rom coms!

21:23.550 --> 21:25.251
That was her thing.
