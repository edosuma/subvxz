00:34.723 --> 00:35.756
Hi, baby.

00:35.789 --> 00:36.856
Hello, mother.

00:36.889 --> 00:39.257
Ooh, who is this?

00:39.290 --> 00:40.723
Where's the car?

00:40.757 --> 00:42.423
Oh, it's all the way around
the corner, I just...

00:42.457 --> 00:44.424
Oh, okay, hello.

00:46.324 --> 00:47.424
Um, and I don't know.

00:48.390 --> 00:49.956
Wait, what don't
you know, honey?

00:49.989 --> 00:50.823
Who the cat is.

00:52.790 --> 00:54.857
What do you mean,
you don't know?

00:57.757 --> 00:58.757
Andie!

01:09.757 --> 01:11.625
You can't keep that
cat at our house.

01:11.657 --> 01:12.856
Oh come on.

01:12.889 --> 01:14.557
You are not bringing a
stray cat into my home.

01:14.590 --> 01:15.856
- I'm sorry.
- It's not a stray.

01:15.889 --> 01:17.423
It has a collar.

01:17.456 --> 01:18.323
Well, then it's
somebody's pet and we need

01:18.356 --> 01:19.323
to get it back to them.

01:19.356 --> 01:19.991
There's no tags.

01:21.356 --> 01:22.723
I don't know what
to tell you, kiddo.

01:22.756 --> 01:24.523
You're not responsible
enough for a pet.

01:24.556 --> 01:25.524
Are you kidding me, right now?

01:25.557 --> 01:26.624
I'm an adult, Karen.

01:26.657 --> 01:27.856
Mom.

01:27.890 --> 01:29.823
I just lived on
my own for a year.

01:29.856 --> 01:30.790
Eight months.

01:33.822 --> 01:34.656
Petty.

01:41.491 --> 01:42.856
We need to get a letter box.

01:47.823 --> 01:48.724
Shit.

01:48.757 --> 01:49.890
What's wrong?

01:49.923 --> 01:50.790
It's that cunt Millie.

01:50.823 --> 01:51.890
Do not say that word!

01:51.923 --> 01:53.024
Shut up, mom.

01:53.056 --> 01:54.856
Oh, so now I'm mom.

01:54.890 --> 01:55.791
- Hey, Millie!
- Mom!

01:57.457 --> 01:58.491
Hi, Karen.

01:59.657 --> 02:00.491
Hey, Andie.

02:01.890 --> 02:03.291
- You're back.
- Yep.

02:05.823 --> 02:06.991
How's your mom?

02:07.024 --> 02:07.923
She's good.

02:09.424 --> 02:10.723
How long are you back for?

02:10.757 --> 02:14.890
Oh, not long, just a
quick little recharge.

02:14.922 --> 02:15.757
Okay.

02:17.923 --> 02:19.590
Well, it was good to see you.

02:19.623 --> 02:20.458
You too.

02:21.889 --> 02:23.623
Tell your mom, I was
asking after her.

02:23.656 --> 02:24.557
I will.

02:24.589 --> 02:25.856
I'm sure she says the same.

02:27.857 --> 02:30.824
Well I'll see you around
Andie, now that you're back.

02:30.856 --> 02:31.789
Yeah, I mean, I'll
probably be gone again,

02:31.823 --> 02:32.991
like really soon, so.

02:34.590 --> 02:35.425
Bye.

02:45.923 --> 02:47.823
I still can't figure
out why you're here.

02:47.857 --> 02:48.957
Neil.

02:48.989 --> 02:49.856
Didn't you miss me?

02:49.890 --> 02:51.324
Not particularly.

02:51.356 --> 02:52.823
Liar.

02:52.857 --> 02:54.958
Was the liberal arts major
too stressful for you?

02:55.690 --> 02:56.789
I made
your favorite meal.

02:56.823 --> 02:58.590
That's very funny.

02:58.622 --> 03:00.923
We have got corn dogs for days.

03:02.590 --> 03:03.425
Thanks mom!

03:06.391 --> 03:07.357
Hello, father.

03:07.391 --> 03:10.523
There she is, my favorite child.

03:10.555 --> 03:11.724
Hey.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.956
Well, stop being such
a little asshole.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.889
Mom, dad called me an asshole.

03:15.923 --> 03:17.323
Dean, language.

03:17.357 --> 03:19.890
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

03:19.922 --> 03:20.924
How was rehearsal?

03:21.789 --> 03:23.823
Riveting, how is college?

03:23.857 --> 03:25.491
Bewitching.

03:25.522 --> 03:28.923
Karen, thank you so
much for cooking,

03:28.957 --> 03:30.856
but why are we eating corn dogs?

03:30.890 --> 03:32.258
Because they're
Andie's favorite.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.756
When she was seven.

03:33.789 --> 03:34.957
Okay, mom.

03:34.989 --> 03:36.390
Thank you.

03:36.423 --> 03:38.590
Mom, how does it feel
having a college dropout

03:38.622 --> 03:39.823
as your first born.

03:39.857 --> 03:42.923
Neil, I am proud of my
daughter, no matter what

03:42.957 --> 03:45.924
even if she ends up
homeless and unemployed.

03:45.956 --> 03:46.857
Thank you.

03:46.889 --> 03:48.789
But now is as good a time as any

03:48.822 --> 03:50.823
to start talking
about your plan.

03:50.856 --> 03:51.889
Do you want me to
help you find one?

03:51.923 --> 03:54.423
No, I'm good.

03:54.457 --> 03:55.856
I have a job.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.890
That's great news, where?

03:57.923 --> 03:58.889
Abby's store.

03:58.923 --> 04:00.624
Way to aim for the stars.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.557
Neil, shut it.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.889
See, I told you not to worry.

04:03.923 --> 04:04.756
A mother always worries.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.890
We can't all be as
loosey goosey as you.

04:06.922 --> 04:08.524
Yeah loosey goose.

04:09.690 --> 04:13.924
Oh, who is this little
beautiful creature?

04:13.956 --> 04:16.257
I found her at the
bus stop this morning.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.423
Hi there, pretty lady.

04:18.456 --> 04:19.357
Feel.

04:19.391 --> 04:20.857
Mom says, we can't keep her.

04:20.889 --> 04:22.656
Oh, nonsense.

04:22.690 --> 04:25.857
We can't put such a beautiful
creature out into the cold.

04:25.889 --> 04:28.257
Enough with the theatrics,
Dean, it's 80 degrees.

04:28.291 --> 04:29.522
What's her name?

04:29.555 --> 04:30.790
Naming her implies
we're keeping her.

04:30.823 --> 04:31.724
I was thinking, Karen.

04:31.756 --> 04:32.556
I like it.

04:32.589 --> 04:33.390
Very funny.

04:33.423 --> 04:34.023
Hi, Karen.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.456
Nope, no.

04:35.489 --> 04:36.623
Then it's settled.

04:36.657 --> 04:37.790
Karen the cat.

04:38.957 --> 04:43.757
Baby, Hello sweetie,
come to daddy.

04:43.789 --> 04:46.990
Oh yes, look at
that little tail.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.557
And their seats, go down here.

04:51.589 --> 04:52.624
Cool.

04:54.024 --> 04:55.924
I know it's not a super
sophisticated system

04:55.957 --> 04:57.890
but it's just been
me for a long time.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.489
Are you kidding me?

04:59.523 --> 05:01.324
Abby, you own your own
store, this is so great.

05:01.356 --> 05:03.923
I know, pretty wild, right?

05:03.957 --> 05:05.589
Yes.

05:05.623 --> 05:06.924
Things are kind of slow,
but they've been picking up

05:06.956 --> 05:07.956
a little.

05:07.989 --> 05:09.624
You're killing it.

05:09.657 --> 05:10.490
Thanks, Andie.

05:11.889 --> 05:14.257
All right you're feeling good?

05:14.290 --> 05:15.990
Yeah, totally.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.691
All right, I think
I'm gonna head out.

05:19.856 --> 05:20.856
Okay.

05:23.689 --> 05:27.357
And just a reminder,
the alarm code is 8213.

05:27.389 --> 05:28.291
Yes.

05:28.324 --> 05:29.857
Do you wanna write that down?

05:29.890 --> 05:31.590
No, you got it.

05:31.623 --> 05:32.857
No, I got it, okay.

05:32.889 --> 05:34.258
Okay, and don't forget
to bring the sign in.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.856
Okay, all right, I will.

05:36.887 --> 05:36.689
Yeah.

05:36.722 --> 05:37.522
Have fun.

05:37.555 --> 05:38.389
Bye.

05:39.789 --> 05:40.589
Bye, love you.

05:40.622 --> 05:41.689
Love you too.

05:41.722 --> 05:42.556
See you.

07:33.790 --> 07:38.790
As I live and breath,
Andrea Offerman is that you?

07:39.191 --> 07:40.557
I'll be damned.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.257
Penelope, I haven't
seen you since,

07:42.290 --> 07:43.289
before the war.

07:48.455 --> 07:52.290
God, hi, girl I
missed you so much.

07:52.323 --> 07:53.557
Tell me everything.

08:02.722 --> 08:06.389
Yeah, I've been home
for like, 48 hours.

08:06.423 --> 08:08.891
But we'll see.

08:10.322 --> 08:12.323
Well, I super believe in you.

08:13.456 --> 08:15.891
What specifically did
you hate about uni?

08:16.823 --> 08:17.824
Kind of all of it.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.924
No, it wasn't bad, it was just,

08:21.956 --> 08:23.824
everyone takes it so seriously.

08:23.857 --> 08:25.024
And I don't know if
you remember this

08:25.056 --> 08:27.522
but taking things
seriously is not my forte.

08:27.555 --> 08:29.356
It's not your
forte, that's right.

08:30.822 --> 08:31.890
Hate you.

08:31.923 --> 08:35.789
I told you so, but you totally
should have just stayed

08:35.823 --> 08:37.289
here with me.

08:37.322 --> 08:39.289
Community college is
where it's at, dude.

08:39.323 --> 08:41.590
Absolutely, no one
takes it seriously.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.990
And not even your parents.

08:46.590 --> 08:51.390
Shut up, also it's not like
you learn less real facts.

08:54.056 --> 08:55.991
Oh my God, look who it is.

08:56.024 --> 08:56.856
Wow.

08:56.890 --> 09:00.289
Whoa, hey Andie, oh
my God, you're back.

09:00.323 --> 09:01.923
I'm back.

09:01.957 --> 09:03.623
Whoa, dude.

09:03.656 --> 09:07.289
I mean like, yeah, no I
saw on your Instagram story

09:07.322 --> 09:11.256
or whatever, but it's
really good to see you.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.323
You too, man.

09:13.823 --> 09:15.257
Oh, what are you
doing right now?

09:15.289 --> 09:16.756
Do you wanna grab
dinner with us?

09:16.789 --> 09:18.489
Yeah, no, I'd love to.

09:18.522 --> 09:22.889
I'm not really doing anything,
just enjoying the view.

09:22.922 --> 09:27.589
I am actually gonna
go home, yeah.

09:27.623 --> 09:30.356
Boo wants to have dinner.

09:30.389 --> 09:32.923
Whipped, home to your bitch.

09:32.956 --> 09:34.422
Okay, I will.

09:34.456 --> 09:39.457
Yeah, that sounds
great, full disclosure,

09:40.322 --> 09:42.389
I'm pretty high, right now.

09:42.422 --> 09:43.856
We know Hans.

09:45.355 --> 09:45.990
Okay, cool.

09:49.057 --> 09:51.724
So, how are we talking here?

09:53.323 --> 09:54.889
Three.

09:54.923 --> 09:57.522
Oh, it's not that bad.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.390
Out of three.

10:00.355 --> 10:02.223
Hey guys, how's it going?

10:02.957 --> 10:04.389
Yeah, good, how are you?

10:04.422 --> 10:07.357
A bit of a slow night,
but no complaints.

10:07.390 --> 10:08.224
Cool.

10:09.590 --> 10:12.024
Can I start you off
with something to drink?

10:12.056 --> 10:14.323
Yeah, We're not engines.

10:16.923 --> 10:18.890
As in we don't need fuel.

10:18.923 --> 10:19.791
Yeah, I got it.

10:20.989 --> 10:22.623
Can we please get two
eyed peas, please?

10:22.656 --> 10:25.456
Sounds good, and you
guys got your ids.

10:25.489 --> 10:27.790
Oh, wouldn't did you
like to know little girl?

10:29.422 --> 10:33.689
Yep, It's cool, I
remember you guys.

10:33.722 --> 10:34.523
Thanks.

10:35.723 --> 10:38.757
Wow, stoned Hans is
as fun as I remember.

10:40.023 --> 10:41.857
Yeah, I need some food
to bring me back down.

10:41.890 --> 10:44.422
Yeah, you do.

10:44.455 --> 10:47.389
Is that nice? Yeah?.

11:12.489 --> 11:14.422
High school wasn't the worst.

11:14.455 --> 11:15.589
It really wasn't.

11:15.622 --> 11:19.556
I mean, it beat the shit out
of community college, anyways.

11:19.589 --> 11:22.522
Penny was saying
it's not that bad.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.556
It's fine.

11:23.589 --> 11:26.523
It's just a little
bland, I guess.

11:26.556 --> 11:29.523
I mean, the destitute
nature of it is fine,

11:29.555 --> 11:31.523
but the shallowness
of some of the people

11:31.556 --> 11:33.390
is just the worst.

11:33.423 --> 11:35.590
Then people pretending
they're in Berkeley

11:35.623 --> 11:37.424
or some fancy shit.

11:40.889 --> 11:42.790
That made the place shit.

11:42.823 --> 11:44.457
Basic bitches are everywhere.

11:44.490 --> 11:48.557
I guess, I was just
hoping we could all get on

11:48.589 --> 11:50.422
with our lives and
learn something,

11:50.456 --> 11:52.990
so we could climb out
of this shit hole.

11:53.022 --> 11:54.756
This shit hole is not
the worst place to be.

11:54.789 --> 11:59.557
I guess, I'm assuming
you didn't flunk out.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.022
No.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.891
Figured, you're too smart.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.522
Did you just lose interest?

12:06.555 --> 12:09.456
I never really had
it, to be honest.

12:09.490 --> 12:12.756
Right, some good
parties at least?

12:12.790 --> 12:14.823
Yeah, there were a few of those.

12:14.856 --> 12:18.256
I don't know, even then it
was like people were tryna

12:18.289 --> 12:21.656
be something out of like,
an "American Pie" movie,

12:21.689 --> 12:23.389
or something.

12:23.423 --> 12:26.290
It's like people were playing
the part of college students.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.657
Does that make sense?

12:28.690 --> 12:31.423
Yeah, I mean, that doesn't
sound that bad, honestly.

12:31.455 --> 12:32.623
Cool.

12:32.656 --> 12:34.689
Sure, but give me a
sixer beer, and a joint

12:34.723 --> 12:36.990
with my old pal Hans
over that any day.

12:40.055 --> 12:40.891
Thanks.

12:43.489 --> 12:44.556
All done with these?

12:45.555 --> 12:46.590
Yes, please.

12:47.956 --> 12:49.489
You okay?

12:49.522 --> 12:53.456
Oh yeah, I mean, yes, I am.

12:53.489 --> 12:56.356
Thank you, I needed that.

12:57.590 --> 12:58.956
Sure did.

12:58.988 --> 12:59.889
Could we just grab the bill?

12:59.921 --> 13:00.689
I got it right here for you.

13:00.722 --> 13:02.523
Oh, so efficient.

13:02.556 --> 13:04.457
I do what I can.

13:04.489 --> 13:07.456
I got this, it's a
welcome home gift.

13:07.489 --> 13:09.824
Aw! Thanks dude.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.356
Of course.

13:11.389 --> 13:14.323
Meals on wheels is going
well, yeah, rich guy.

13:14.356 --> 13:16.590
It is, it pays okay.

13:16.623 --> 13:19.390
I mean, they really can't tell
the difference between bills.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.824
So, they always end up
tipping you way too much.

13:21.856 --> 13:23.489
And you don't tell them?

13:23.522 --> 13:25.322
That's so dark shit dude.

13:25.356 --> 13:26.657
No, of course I do.

13:26.690 --> 13:29.690
But then they think it's
cute that I'm being honest,

13:29.722 --> 13:30.956
and they let me keep it.

13:30.989 --> 13:32.623
I bet they do.

13:32.657 --> 13:35.856
No doubt, they love
having a gay delivery guy.

13:35.888 --> 13:38.690
I mean, the only gay in the
village has its upsides.

13:39.622 --> 13:40.989
Pinball?

13:41.023 --> 13:44.390
Heck yeah, it's like the
only sport I'm good at.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.724
Well, that and cribbage.

13:46.757 --> 13:47.889
Cribbage?

13:47.921 --> 13:49.656
Yeah, a lot of
people I deliver to,

13:49.689 --> 13:52.856
are elderly, white
women, so we play.

13:52.889 --> 13:54.322
Cool.

13:54.356 --> 13:56.522
Also, Neither of
those are sports.

13:56.556 --> 13:58.889
Just let me have this, okay.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.657
Dibs on "Star Trek".

14:00.690 --> 14:02.357
You can have it.

14:02.390 --> 14:05.556
Yeah, some of us have
grown up since you left.

14:05.590 --> 14:06.522
I matured to X-men.

14:06.555 --> 14:10.657
Oh, X-men? Okay.

14:10.690 --> 14:11.990
Okay.

14:12.022 --> 14:12.890
Star Trek.

14:23.423 --> 14:24.989
Abby's store not
cutting for you?

14:26.589 --> 14:27.956
Abby's store isn't really
cutting it for anyone.

14:27.989 --> 14:29.657
Oh shit! Is she closing down?

14:29.690 --> 14:32.724
No, she can't really afford
an employee right now.

14:34.590 --> 14:38.490
Look what I found,
look at these photos.

14:38.523 --> 14:41.323
Andie, you were
so gosh darn cute.

14:41.356 --> 14:42.624
Yikes.

14:42.657 --> 14:43.657
Excuse you.

14:43.690 --> 14:44.590
Isn't she precious?

14:44.623 --> 14:46.289
You look like you're autistic.

14:46.323 --> 14:46.956
You're such a dick.

14:46.989 --> 14:48.624
It's not funny, Dean.

14:48.657 --> 14:49.690
I don't think it's funny either.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.724
She looks just like me.

14:51.756 --> 14:53.624
Oh, that must mean
I have Asperger's.

14:54.888 --> 14:56.389
You do have Asperger's.

14:57.556 --> 15:00.357
Are you looking for
a new job already?

15:00.390 --> 15:02.353
Okay, this was not my fault.

15:02.355 --> 15:03.489
Abby, can't afford me.

15:04.622 --> 15:05.423
Sure.

15:05.455 --> 15:06.256
It's true.

15:06.289 --> 15:07.657
Jesus, look at this one.

15:10.456 --> 15:11.888
You know I wasn't your
mother's first choice, right?

15:11.922 --> 15:13.522
Yeah, I can imagine.

15:13.556 --> 15:14.390
It's not true.

15:15.555 --> 15:17.023
Just knocked you up,
at the right time.

15:17.056 --> 15:18.690
Look how handsome you are.

15:18.723 --> 15:20.524
You see, she can't even deny it.

15:21.657 --> 15:23.324
Really Andie, drinking already.

15:25.390 --> 15:26.523
Can you grab me one too?

15:26.557 --> 15:28.623
Okay, I'm unemployed mom, can
you just let me have one day

15:28.656 --> 15:29.789
of day drinking please?

15:37.955 --> 15:39.289
Thanks.

15:39.323 --> 15:40.289
Come work for me.

15:42.323 --> 15:45.357
Yeah, I could.

15:45.389 --> 15:47.856
I think you're forgetting that
I'm not a licensed therapist.

15:47.889 --> 15:51.390
No, not as a therapist,
as a receptionist.

15:51.422 --> 15:52.756
Ever since Alice,
went back to school.

15:52.789 --> 15:54.724
It's been hard for
me to keep up with...

15:54.755 --> 15:56.590
Look how dumb Neil looks.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.457
Dean, Would you stop
insulting everyone,

15:59.490 --> 16:01.556
and stop making
fun of your kids.

16:01.589 --> 16:02.823
I'm still not sure they're mine.

16:02.856 --> 16:03.956
It's not funny.

16:03.989 --> 16:05.390
I think it's funny.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.290
You just be answering
phones, taking payments,

16:07.323 --> 16:08.523
and managing my calendar.

16:08.555 --> 16:10.322
Jesus, anything
else your majesty?

16:10.355 --> 16:11.788
Well, I could always
hire someone else,

16:11.822 --> 16:13.923
and start charging you rent.

16:13.956 --> 16:14.823
I'll take it.

16:14.855 --> 16:16.356
I thought so.

16:16.390 --> 16:17.923
Look at this stupid
face.

16:22.055 --> 16:24.023
Yeah, and then I told
him, "You know what?

16:24.056 --> 16:26.856
I was just born
this way."

16:27.721 --> 16:28.922
Wow! What a story.

16:28.956 --> 16:33.624
Okay, babe, well Abby
, Penny tells me

16:33.657 --> 16:35.656
your boyfriend is in a band?

16:35.690 --> 16:36.990
Formerly, yes.

16:37.023 --> 16:38.557
Oh, did they break up?

16:38.590 --> 16:39.624
Oh no, we broke up.

16:39.657 --> 16:42.755
Oh my God I knew it, sorry dude.

16:42.788 --> 16:46.689
It's cool, it ran its course.

16:46.721 --> 16:48.855
Looking to find comfort
in another man's arms?

16:48.888 --> 16:50.589
My room's upstairs.

16:50.622 --> 16:51.856
Neil, stop being gross.

16:52.821 --> 16:54.855
It's nice right?

16:55.789 --> 16:58.590
So how did you two meet?

16:58.623 --> 17:03.556
Well, I mean, Oh my
God look at you go.

17:05.422 --> 17:07.922
You know this is
what I miss the most,

17:07.954 --> 17:09.856
I fucking love dinner parties.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.990
I love your dinner parties.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.888
Well, to answer your question.

17:18.423 --> 17:23.424
I was in the club
dancing with some friends

17:24.489 --> 17:27.887
and he comes up behind me,
grabs my ass, sorry Neil.

17:27.922 --> 17:28.723
Oh!

17:29.689 --> 17:32.656
Asks if I'm DTF, you all
know what that means.

17:32.689 --> 17:35.290
And then we've been
together ever since.

17:35.322 --> 17:39.022
Yeah, no, you really need
to stop telling people that.

17:39.056 --> 17:39.990
Okay.

17:40.022 --> 17:40.989
First impression.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.889
No, I'm a TA at VCC.

17:44.921 --> 17:47.556
Yeah, your parents
must be so proud.

17:47.589 --> 17:48.856
Jesus Christ, Neil.

17:49.788 --> 17:51.655
No, it's fine.

17:51.689 --> 17:54.357
A little man with the
jokes huh? all right.

17:54.390 --> 17:58.623
All right, yeah, he's a
TA in my marketing class

17:58.655 --> 18:01.289
and I mean, let's be honest,

18:01.323 --> 18:04.822
couldn't keep his eyes off
this freshmen bod for months.

18:04.856 --> 18:09.656
And finally, he worked up
the courage to ask me out

18:09.689 --> 18:12.556
to see some old people band.

18:12.590 --> 18:15.990
Arcade Fire is
not an old person band.

18:16.022 --> 18:17.856
Do you make a habit of leering

18:17.888 --> 18:19.423
at your younger students, Adam?

18:20.855 --> 18:23.889
Well, when you put it that
way, I guess I actually

18:23.921 --> 18:26.456
do sound less creepy
in Penny's story.

18:29.921 --> 18:30.722
Cute.

18:30.756 --> 18:32.390
I'm 25.

18:32.422 --> 18:33.755
He's so old.

18:33.789 --> 18:34.823
It's fine.

18:34.856 --> 18:35.690
He's so old.

19:19.456 --> 19:20.822
Is that what I think it is?

19:20.855 --> 19:22.688
Here is the apple pie.

19:22.722 --> 19:23.723
Fuck yeah.

19:27.489 --> 19:29.989
So, I feel like a jerk.

19:30.023 --> 19:34.889
What? Oh that's so fine,
Abby, you overextended.

19:34.922 --> 19:36.390
It happens.

19:36.423 --> 19:37.889
Like, I should've known
that I couldn't afford it

19:37.921 --> 19:41.290
before I offered you a job,
and I was getting overwhelmed.

19:41.322 --> 19:43.688
And I just also really
wanted to help you out.

19:43.722 --> 19:47.323
I know, it's completely okay.

19:47.355 --> 19:50.822
And Hey, I'm only working for
my mom like three days a week.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.522
So, I can come watch your
store whenever you need.

19:54.555 --> 19:55.788
Really?

19:55.822 --> 19:56.856
Yeah.

19:56.889 --> 19:58.457
That's what friends are for.

19:58.489 --> 19:59.855
That's what friends are for.

19:59.889 --> 20:00.856
That's what you sound like.

20:00.888 --> 20:02.755
Fucking go hide in your room.

20:02.789 --> 20:04.655
That's what I was doing anyways.

20:04.689 --> 20:05.590
Bye Abby.

20:07.055 --> 20:07.890
See you dude.

20:11.621 --> 20:12.423
Pie me.

20:14.489 --> 20:16.788
So when you are you flying out?

20:16.822 --> 20:18.457
Tomorrow evening.

20:20.055 --> 20:20.855
Nice.

20:20.888 --> 20:22.423
It's a quick trip, hey.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.955
Yeah, I haven't seen my
parents since Christmas.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.756
So, I figured it was worth
skipping class one Monday.

20:27.889 --> 20:28.923
Cool, cool, cool.

20:31.922 --> 20:36.756
So, when are you planning
on going back to school?

20:37.988 --> 20:40.790
I don't really know that I am.

20:41.789 --> 20:44.855
I'm just kinda figuring
things out as I go, you know.

20:44.889 --> 20:49.856
Sure, but like you
have a plan, right?

20:51.588 --> 20:53.922
No, not really.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.389
Isn't that kind
of irresponsible?

20:59.423 --> 21:00.990
Okay, hey, why don't
we go get a drink?

21:01.022 --> 21:01.822
I'm Fine.

21:01.856 --> 21:02.855
Okay.

21:02.889 --> 21:03.989
Yeah, look dude, I don't know.

21:04.023 --> 21:06.889
But I do know that I'd rather
spend the next few months

21:06.921 --> 21:08.822
or years figuring it out.

21:08.856 --> 21:11.589
Then spending 80 grand
learning about something,

21:11.622 --> 21:13.555
I really don't
give a fuck about.

21:13.588 --> 21:15.422
Yeah, sure, and I'm not
telling you what to do.

21:15.455 --> 21:16.357
Sure you're not.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.389
I mean, this is a crucial age.

21:18.422 --> 21:21.224
Everything you do now affects
the rest of your life.

21:21.888 --> 21:22.722
Sure.

21:23.855 --> 21:25.022
I just don't want you
to make a decision

21:25.055 --> 21:27.589
that'll change your trajectory.

21:27.621 --> 21:28.755
My trajectory.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.423
Come on you're in the Offerman.

21:31.555 --> 21:32.623
I don't really know
what that means,

21:32.655 --> 21:34.922
but what? am I
supposed to be like you

21:34.956 --> 21:37.990
and be yet another millennial
going for a business degree?

21:38.022 --> 21:38.856
Not necessarily.

21:38.889 --> 21:41.521
So, I can compete for
unpaid internships

21:41.555 --> 21:42.889
and maybe become
an associate by 30.

21:43.919 --> 21:44.488
Okay, forget I said anything.

21:44.522 --> 21:46.656
Hey, let's go play
some beer pong, man.

21:46.688 --> 21:48.655
Yeah, come on, come play.

21:52.921 --> 21:53.989
I fucking can't stand that guy.

21:54.023 --> 21:54.822
I know.

22:11.756 --> 22:12.856
What's wrong baby?

22:12.889 --> 22:14.956
Fucking Neil.

22:14.988 --> 22:17.256
I know he can be a
bit of a handful.

22:17.290 --> 22:19.521
No, I can actually
handle a handful.

22:19.555 --> 22:23.923
He's always been a handful,
now he's just like mean.

22:23.956 --> 22:26.257
Well, he's on the
verge of puberty

22:26.290 --> 22:28.923
and he's just having a
hard time talking to women.

22:28.955 --> 22:30.755
He's a dick to Dad too.

22:30.788 --> 22:33.956
True, but your father doesn't
exactly command respect.

22:33.988 --> 22:36.688
Okay, he was being
extremely rude to everyone

22:36.722 --> 22:37.756
at my party, last night.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.956
Like, come on, I wasn't that
bad when I was that age.

22:39.989 --> 22:41.089
Oh God, no.

22:41.122 --> 22:45.789
Your problem years were like
14 to I'll keep you posted,

22:45.821 --> 22:46.888
Funny.

22:46.922 --> 22:49.956
Honey, why don't you just
take him out for ice cream,

22:49.988 --> 22:52.922
like you used, hell
even bring Penny.

22:54.454 --> 22:55.388
Okay.

22:55.422 --> 22:56.655
Okay.

22:59.354 --> 23:01.855
Your perspective creates
your reality, hun.

23:01.889 --> 23:02.723
Get it.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.622
Boom! I am the stone
skipping champion.

23:20.656 --> 23:21.522
Oh yeah?

23:21.554 --> 23:23.455
Yep, suck it up losers.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.856
All right, no one
likes a gloater, Neil.

23:26.721 --> 23:29.355
Okay, ice cream?

23:29.389 --> 23:30.322
Loser pays.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.588
So you're saying you
would've paid if I won.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.456
Nope.

23:50.455 --> 23:51.923
If you're not gonna
give me Abby's number,

23:51.955 --> 23:52.990
then I'm gonna hit on Penny.

23:53.022 --> 23:54.688
Oh, go for it rockstar.

23:54.721 --> 23:56.257
Penny, has a boyfriend.

23:56.288 --> 23:57.689
Right.

23:57.721 --> 24:00.256
Who? That widely successful
guy from last night?

24:00.289 --> 24:00.856
Come on.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.388
You're like six.

24:02.422 --> 24:04.322
And you don't tell someone
you're gonna hit on them.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.288
Then how do you do it?

24:06.322 --> 24:07.423
I could use some pointers.

24:08.788 --> 24:13.622
Are you really asking
like, for someone specific?

24:14.855 --> 24:16.622
Oh, cool.

24:16.655 --> 24:17.955
Oh my God, who is it?

24:17.988 --> 24:20.855
Slow my dear.

24:20.888 --> 24:22.990
To know who it is secrecy
is of the utmost importance

24:23.022 --> 24:23.923
at this age?

24:23.955 --> 24:25.388
Really?

24:25.421 --> 24:26.622
Yeah, man.

24:26.655 --> 24:27.955
Okay, you might think
seeding it with a friend

24:27.988 --> 24:31.856
is a good idea, but
generally it just leads

24:31.888 --> 24:33.355
to way more complications.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.355
Like either they'll start
liking you, for example.

24:36.389 --> 24:39.388
Or they'll start
on a rumor mill.

24:39.422 --> 24:40.856
So, what do I do?

24:40.888 --> 24:42.321
Just kiss her, or something.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.623
Whoa! Who are you,
Harvey Weinstein?

24:44.655 --> 24:48.755
What Penny is trying to
say is that doesn't really

24:48.789 --> 24:49.723
fly anymore.

24:50.554 --> 24:52.356
The game has changed.

24:52.388 --> 24:55.388
Super, just in time
for my puberty.

24:55.421 --> 24:58.656
Yeah, okay, it does suck
from that perspective,

24:58.688 --> 25:02.888
but it kind of, only
from that perspective.

25:02.922 --> 25:05.922
But does that mean I
can't hit on anyone?

25:05.956 --> 25:08.455
is flirting, not feminist?

25:08.488 --> 25:10.521
Wow an enlightened boy, you are.

25:10.555 --> 25:12.223
Yes, thanks Yoda.

25:14.988 --> 25:16.889
No, I do hear what
you're saying,

25:16.921 --> 25:19.989
but they're just two
completely different issues.

25:20.022 --> 25:21.255
Like entirely.

25:21.288 --> 25:23.322
Like yeah, I mean
there's a difference

25:23.354 --> 25:25.355
between flirting and assault.

25:25.389 --> 25:26.322
Yes.

25:26.354 --> 25:28.455
So what do I do?

25:28.489 --> 25:31.289
Well, do you think she knows?

25:31.322 --> 25:32.456
I don't know.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.255
Have you like caught
her eye, a few times?

25:35.289 --> 25:37.723
Yeah, and did you
like look away fast?

25:37.755 --> 25:39.555
Good, okay, that's good.

25:40.588 --> 25:41.589
Stage one is good.

25:42.555 --> 25:44.422
The next part's gonna be harder.

25:45.255 --> 25:47.723
You're gonna have to
talk to her, alone.

25:48.955 --> 25:49.889
How do I do that?

25:51.489 --> 25:54.421
I think you'll be surprised,
if you're both interested.

25:54.455 --> 25:55.956
It's just gonna happen.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.488
But, the key is, you need
to make that happen soon.

25:59.521 --> 26:02.322
Once eye contact is engaged,
time is of the essence.

26:02.354 --> 26:06.790
Yes, and ask her about
herself, be interested.

26:08.422 --> 26:11.855
Okay, cool, Penny, can we
talk in private, please?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.822
Oh my God.

26:18.454 --> 26:20.955
Oh God no, and don't
smile like that at her.

26:20.989 --> 26:23.223
Fuck so, you're a
little asshole.

26:25.522 --> 26:27.323
God, I miss you guys.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.655
And then we just
deal out the cards

26:32.688 --> 26:35.522
and we put the markers
into the board.

26:35.554 --> 26:36.955
That's my favorite part.

26:36.989 --> 26:39.790
Oh, you just like putting
pointy things into tight holes.

26:41.488 --> 26:44.355
And then we just
deal out four cards.

26:44.388 --> 26:46.422
And we call that the crib.

26:46.454 --> 26:47.955
Yeah, I know that.

26:47.989 --> 26:51.456
I read it on the internet, you
didn't think I'd show up here

26:51.488 --> 26:53.656
with a bunch of pros and
not do my research.

26:53.688 --> 26:55.289
All right then.

26:57.288 --> 26:58.655
Would you knock that off, T?

26:58.689 --> 26:59.922
Knock what off?

26:59.956 --> 27:01.422
You know exactly what
you need to knock off.

27:01.455 --> 27:02.956
He's not home.

27:02.988 --> 27:04.023
Who's not home?

27:04.055 --> 27:05.488
Mr. Daniels.

27:06.722 --> 27:08.288
Who's Mr. Daniels?

27:08.322 --> 27:09.789
Only the most
eligible widower on

27:09.822 --> 27:10.756
this side of main street.

27:10.788 --> 27:12.421
Possibly the whole city.

27:12.455 --> 27:14.556
And why would you think
a man of that caliber

27:14.589 --> 27:16.455
would be interested in you?

27:16.489 --> 27:18.989
How exactly did you
know he wasn't home?

27:19.023 --> 27:21.723
unless you were doing exactly
the same thing, this morning.

27:21.755 --> 27:23.388
We were talking.

27:23.422 --> 27:25.522
Oh, you were just talking?
And you were just conveniently

27:25.555 --> 27:26.855
outside, when he was leaving.

27:26.888 --> 27:27.955
I was having my morning coffee.

27:27.989 --> 27:30.989
And you probably poured him
a cup of that premium shit

27:31.023 --> 27:31.956
that I paid for.

27:31.988 --> 27:33.521
Just being a good neighbor.

27:33.554 --> 27:34.788
You could learn a thing or two.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.955
I'm being a good
neighbor in other ways.

27:36.989 --> 27:41.321
And what way is that? Being
the neighborhood tricycle?

27:41.354 --> 27:43.388
Don't be mad at me just
because I've had more

27:43.422 --> 27:45.356
than one sexual partner
in the past 50 years.

27:45.388 --> 27:49.455
Okay, ladies, Mrs Tremblay
enough with the slut-shaming.

27:49.488 --> 27:50.622
Miss Tremblay, is an
independent woman.

27:50.656 --> 27:52.388
She can sleep with
whoever she wants.

27:52.422 --> 27:54.789
Oh, don't worry, she does.

27:54.821 --> 27:56.556
Hey, you heard her.

27:57.322 --> 28:00.755
Okay, we need to come
up with a solution here.

28:00.789 --> 28:02.556
And what do you have in mind?

28:04.388 --> 28:08.388
I don't know, maybe
you can share him.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.589
With her, please.

28:10.621 --> 28:13.455
Her body hasn't exactly kept up.

28:13.489 --> 28:17.289
Oh, ha ha ha let's
get this game going.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.388
So, have you guys
always lived together?

28:23.422 --> 28:24.990
Oh no, I just
moved in, recently.

28:25.021 --> 28:26.822
Not recently enough.

28:26.855 --> 28:29.022
It's been almost two years
since she's been invading

28:29.054 --> 28:30.488
my personal space.

28:30.522 --> 28:31.588
That long already?

28:31.621 --> 28:32.955
She's been counting.

28:32.988 --> 28:34.788
She thinks, I need company.

28:34.822 --> 28:37.556
She's scared I'm gonna
turn into an old cook

28:37.589 --> 28:38.856
without Michael.

28:38.889 --> 28:40.556
Yeah, turn into.

28:40.589 --> 28:41.521
And Micheal is?

28:41.555 --> 28:42.789
My husband.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.021
Oh, of course, I'm sorry.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.256
Don't be, I killed him.

28:46.288 --> 28:49.722
I joke, it was cancer.

28:49.755 --> 28:52.655
The bastard smoked a
pack a day for 50 years.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.289
You know you can't
do that to people.

28:54.322 --> 28:56.522
You have got crazy
eyes Tremblay.

28:56.554 --> 28:57.956
One of these days,
you're gonna do that,

28:57.987 --> 28:59.855
and somebody's gonna believe
you, and lock you up.

28:59.888 --> 29:02.655
Can you imagine? Orange
is not her color.

29:02.689 --> 29:04.322
Oh, suck a Dick.

29:04.354 --> 29:07.522
That's why I'm always on
this guy, when he's smoking.

29:07.554 --> 29:08.622
I don't smoke.

29:08.656 --> 29:10.388
Oh please.

29:10.422 --> 29:12.623
You don't think I can tell
when you're working high?

29:12.655 --> 29:13.822
We lived through the 60s.

29:13.855 --> 29:15.588
It's not the same as cigarettes.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.456
You know that can't be true.

29:17.488 --> 29:19.355
Okay, Well would you
prefer that I vape?

29:19.388 --> 29:23.455
Oh, please, so you can look
like a giant fucking douche

29:23.488 --> 29:24.421
no thank you.

29:32.555 --> 29:34.022
How'd you two meet?

29:34.054 --> 29:37.755
Womb mates, roommates,
will end up being two mates.

29:37.789 --> 29:40.289
I actually meant how'd
you and Michael meet?

29:40.321 --> 29:43.622
Michael, now that's a story.

29:43.655 --> 29:45.722
He was just home from the war.

29:45.755 --> 29:46.955
World war two?

29:46.987 --> 29:50.288
Vietnam, how old do
you think we are?

29:50.321 --> 29:52.488
Well, you know what
soldiers can be like.

29:52.521 --> 29:55.622
We tried to play the twin
thing on 'em a few times,

29:55.656 --> 29:56.689
but well...

29:56.722 --> 29:58.789
He only had eyes for you.

29:58.821 --> 30:00.522
She has slutty eyes.

30:03.689 --> 30:05.389
Well it was really
awesome meeting you guys.

30:05.421 --> 30:06.988
It's nice to finally
put faces to names.

30:07.021 --> 30:08.623
Oh, it's a pleasure hun.

30:08.655 --> 30:12.788
When the fax for
humoring tool cooks.

30:12.822 --> 30:14.856
Do you guys wanna do
this again next Thursday?

30:14.888 --> 30:17.656
Don't say things you don't
mean, we'll hold you to it.

30:17.688 --> 30:18.822
No, let's let's do it.

30:18.856 --> 30:21.288
I mean, this could be like a
weekly cribbage club you know?

30:21.322 --> 30:22.955
When you say it
that sounds lame.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.656
All right, next Thursday, it is.

30:24.688 --> 30:26.555
You know something, sweetie?

30:26.589 --> 30:29.623
If you weren't queer,
you'd have a steady ready.

30:29.655 --> 30:31.488
We need to find a
man, for this man.

30:31.522 --> 30:32.623
Don't say queer.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.522
No, that's the good word now.

30:34.554 --> 30:35.589
That can't be true.

30:35.621 --> 30:36.656
No, she's right.

30:38.055 --> 30:39.489
I learn something new every day.

30:39.521 --> 30:41.521
Well, I hear Mr.
Daniels is available.

30:41.555 --> 30:42.456
Watch it.

30:42.488 --> 30:44.255
I'm sorry, all right.

30:44.289 --> 30:46.689
Bye Miss Tremblay, bye Mrs
Tremblay, See you Thursday.

30:46.722 --> 30:48.556
Have a good night you too.

31:30.421 --> 31:33.488
How much money did Miss
Tremblay slide to you?

31:33.522 --> 31:35.989
$50, she said to buy
you something nice.

31:36.021 --> 31:39.488
Buy me something
nice? . Cute.

31:42.054 --> 31:44.622
You were so close,
you really were.

31:44.655 --> 31:46.854
You know, I'm not as good
at cribbage as I said I was.

31:46.887 --> 31:47.689
I know.

31:49.689 --> 31:51.821
Should we like get
dinner or something?

31:51.855 --> 31:54.323
Instead of just drinking
Jean's money away?

31:56.288 --> 31:57.488
We could gamble it away.

31:59.621 --> 32:00.955
I think the Tremblays
would be proud.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.656
I think they would.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.755
I think they'd be very proud.

32:04.788 --> 32:07.988
Yeah, definitely
gambling hoes.

32:15.355 --> 32:18.723
Well, this is how I
spend our last dollar.

32:20.987 --> 32:24.622
I mean, we do have more
money, like our own money.

32:24.655 --> 32:25.755
It feels more badass this way.

32:25.787 --> 32:28.589
Totally.

32:28.621 --> 32:29.421
You should do it.

32:29.455 --> 32:30.754
You should do this.

32:54.755 --> 32:55.755
Well?

32:59.388 --> 33:00.722
We just won $20.

33:00.754 --> 33:03.522
$20?.

33:06.787 --> 33:08.854
What could we invest in?

33:08.887 --> 33:09.688
More tabs.

33:09.721 --> 33:10.789
More tabs?

33:12.755 --> 33:14.389
Oh my God, yes.

33:40.755 --> 33:41.955
How do you tell
your kids who think you're

33:41.988 --> 33:45.855
their hero that you're gay?

33:47.522 --> 33:52.256
I know it's 2018, but what nine
or 10 year old wants to hear

33:52.288 --> 33:54.622
that their dad is someone
totally different.

33:59.721 --> 34:01.489
I'm hearing a lot of fear.

34:01.521 --> 34:02.721
Yeah, I'm afraid.

34:04.288 --> 34:05.821
I'm afraid of losing them.

34:05.855 --> 34:07.590
I love them so much.

34:17.321 --> 34:20.888
I don't feel I have a right
to, you don't have kids.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.889
And get to change your
mind about your family.

34:39.954 --> 34:44.955
Ben, I'm hearing a lot of fear.

34:46.589 --> 34:49.889
I'm also hearing a lot of love
from a devoted father, Ben.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.523
Thank you, Karen.

34:53.554 --> 34:56.621
You're doing a great job
in a really hard situation.

34:58.588 --> 35:00.788
I see Andie's back.

35:00.821 --> 35:02.755
I'm getting a sense
that you're wanting

35:02.788 --> 35:04.655
to wrap things up for today?

35:04.688 --> 35:05.855
Is that on track?

35:05.888 --> 35:09.256
If by wrap up, you
mean put it in its box

35:09.289 --> 35:10.755
lock it 10 times.

35:10.787 --> 35:11.955
Clamp it down, yeah.

35:11.987 --> 35:13.587
Unitl this exact time next week?

35:13.621 --> 35:14.755
Then yes.

35:14.787 --> 35:17.522
Okay, and yes.

35:18.422 --> 35:19.522
Andie's back.

35:20.955 --> 35:22.955
Ah, don't worry,
she's a special one.

35:22.987 --> 35:24.255
She'll be okay.

35:24.289 --> 35:24.887
Yeah.

35:24.920 --> 35:25.955
Bike smooth, Karen.

35:34.655 --> 35:35.455
Hey, Andie.

35:35.488 --> 35:36.388
Feeling cured Mr?

35:36.422 --> 35:37.755
Yeah, I think that's it for me.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.322
Cool, I'll just cancel
all your next sessions.

35:40.354 --> 35:42.523
Absolutely not, no.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.255
So? How's your new
crop of students?

35:47.687 --> 35:50.455
I mean they're not you guys,
but they're not bad, I guess.

35:50.489 --> 35:52.555
I mean, I'm drinking
more but that's probably

35:52.588 --> 35:53.488
not their fault.

35:54.921 --> 35:58.855
How do you feel about.. Do
you wanna get a beer later?

35:59.887 --> 36:00.654
Yeah, sure.

36:00.688 --> 36:01.522
Yeah?

36:01.553 --> 36:02.922
Why not?

36:02.954 --> 36:03.754
Do you like the Hallway?

36:03.787 --> 36:04.788
Do you know that place?

36:04.820 --> 36:05.921
Of course, I know
you the Hallway.

36:05.955 --> 36:06.854
Cool I fucking love that place.

36:06.889 --> 36:09.788
Sweet, so I'll see you
there like, 8:00 p.m.

36:09.821 --> 36:10.854
8:00 p.m. great.

36:10.887 --> 36:11.887
Awesome.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.954
Catch you then.

36:12.988 --> 36:14.821
Yeah, see you then, hilarious.

36:14.854 --> 36:16.688
Oh, you owe me money.

36:17.887 --> 36:20.021
Ooh, I forgot my wallet.

36:20.055 --> 36:20.955
Oh!

36:20.987 --> 36:22.954
Ah! Just kidding.

36:22.987 --> 36:25.455
Cool Mr. A with his
jokes, there you go.

36:26.455 --> 36:27.855
Thanks, Andie, catch you later.

36:27.888 --> 36:28.687
Bye.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.788
Welcome home.

36:29.821 --> 36:30.955
Thank you, yeah.

36:38.855 --> 36:40.621
So this is weird, right?

36:41.720 --> 36:43.654
No, I don't think it's weird.

36:43.687 --> 36:45.421
Like I think of it this way,

36:45.454 --> 36:47.554
I've got other
friends in their 30s.

36:47.587 --> 36:51.788
Someone just happened to
teach us to kill mockingbird.

36:51.820 --> 36:52.821
Be normal.

36:52.854 --> 36:53.888
Normal.

36:59.921 --> 37:01.888
Hey, I hope we didn't
keep you waiting too long.

37:01.921 --> 37:03.955
Not at all, I have beer
to keep me company.

37:03.988 --> 37:04.854
I'm glad.

37:04.887 --> 37:05.888
Hey, Hans.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.522
Hey, Mr. Anderson.

37:08.488 --> 37:09.922
I think if we're gonna
be hanging out socially

37:09.954 --> 37:11.022
you should call me Ben.

37:11.055 --> 37:12.389
Right, yeah, Ben.

37:12.422 --> 37:16.356
No, Mr A. I'm
sticking with Mr A.

37:16.389 --> 37:17.622
That's way too weird.

37:17.655 --> 37:19.655
Like first name Mr.
last name, Anderson.

37:19.687 --> 37:20.989
Ben, does not exist to me.

37:21.021 --> 37:21.888
Okay, fair enough.

37:21.921 --> 37:22.989
How weird is that.

37:27.354 --> 37:29.321
No, but I'm sure
no one's lived up

37:29.354 --> 37:31.487
to the theater legend
of Hans, right?

37:31.521 --> 37:33.822
No one understudies
quite like you, dude.

37:34.855 --> 37:37.488
So Hans, I caught up with
Andie, a little earlier.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.655
What's been going on with you?

37:39.687 --> 37:44.655
Oh, not much, just been
working, skateboarding.

37:44.688 --> 37:46.789
Getting high.

37:47.822 --> 37:49.855
Please, like I didn't know
you were getting stoned

37:49.887 --> 37:51.222
every day in class.

37:52.788 --> 37:55.922
I mean, to be fair, it was
more like three days a week.

37:55.954 --> 37:56.788
So.

37:57.888 --> 37:59.356
Are you dating anyone?

38:01.620 --> 38:02.454
What?

38:03.322 --> 38:03.956
Sparks flying?

38:05.587 --> 38:06.421
When?

38:08.955 --> 38:10.855
Well, I assume that
means you overheard

38:10.888 --> 38:13.288
a confidential conversation
I had with your mom.

38:17.821 --> 38:18.655
Maybe.

38:20.588 --> 38:22.322
I'm married Andie.

38:22.355 --> 38:24.955
And while I'm figuring this out

38:24.988 --> 38:28.654
I respect that and
I respect my wife.

38:28.687 --> 38:31.755
Do you really think I want
my first sexual experience

38:31.787 --> 38:34.356
with a man to be with Hans?

38:34.388 --> 38:35.854
No offense, dude.

38:35.888 --> 38:37.256
None, taken.

38:37.288 --> 38:39.222
I'm not really a first
choice kinda guy.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.255
I'm sorry.

38:44.288 --> 38:46.588
I was just completely
out of line.

38:46.620 --> 38:47.454
You were.

38:48.921 --> 38:51.022
But I just want you to be happy

38:51.055 --> 38:53.921
and I think you'd be a lot
happier if you came out.

38:53.954 --> 38:56.355
That is not for you
to decide Andie.

38:59.988 --> 39:04.455
Look, overall I had a
lot of fun this evening.

39:04.488 --> 39:06.754
And let's just pretend the
last two minutes didn't happen.

39:06.787 --> 39:07.587
Okay?

39:07.621 --> 39:08.589
Yes, please.

39:10.021 --> 39:12.921
But I got to get back to the
fam, first round's on me.

39:26.553 --> 39:27.821
So how's everything?

39:27.855 --> 39:28.955
Super, thank you.

39:30.353 --> 39:31.754
Just remembering why
I don't hang around

39:31.787 --> 39:33.387
with 20 year olds anymore.

39:59.289 --> 40:02.289
I'm not gay.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.587
Shut up.

40:07.621 --> 40:08.922
No, seriously.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.287
What?

40:15.021 --> 40:17.821
You were the only openly
gay kid in our class.

40:17.855 --> 40:18.989
Yeah, I know.

40:20.820 --> 40:23.887
Okay, so you're saying,
you're not attracted

40:23.920 --> 40:24.787
to men anymore?

40:24.821 --> 40:27.555
No, like I never was.

40:28.855 --> 40:30.855
Your coming out video
went like viral.

40:31.821 --> 40:36.922
All through elementary
school people made fun of me

40:37.487 --> 40:39.455
for being bad at sports,

40:39.487 --> 40:42.921
or being in band or
whatever, you know.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.887
Sure.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.287
So the summer before high school

40:48.321 --> 40:52.755
I visited my family in Montreal,
my cousin Vince, he's gay.

40:52.788 --> 40:55.288
And he gave me the idea.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.588
Your gay cousin tells
you to pretend to be gay.

40:58.620 --> 41:00.354
No, Jesus Christ, not like that.

41:00.388 --> 41:03.488
No, he was, you know,

41:03.521 --> 41:06.355
and he's like the
coolest guy that I know.

41:06.388 --> 41:11.321
And it was 2012, and Frank
Ocean had just come out

41:11.354 --> 41:15.956
and I don't know, being
gay was kind of cool.

41:16.988 --> 41:21.922
So I figured if I pretended to
be gay just for high school,

41:23.287 --> 41:25.354
maybe I wouldn't get
laid or whatever.

41:25.387 --> 41:27.721
But maybe I could be cool.

41:29.022 --> 41:32.554
Wow, So I guess that
worked out for you hey?

41:32.588 --> 41:37.589
I mean, yeah, I was fucking
prom king, but I also thought

41:39.021 --> 41:40.587
that I would be out of this
town right after I graduated,

41:40.620 --> 41:42.955
and never come back, so.

41:47.054 --> 41:48.320
It's not fucking funny.

41:48.353 --> 41:50.288
I mean it kind of is.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.421
I guess.

41:53.855 --> 41:56.821
I don't expect
you to understand.

41:56.854 --> 41:59.254
You've always had a thing.

42:00.287 --> 42:01.721
What do you mean?

42:01.755 --> 42:03.988
Come on, you're Andie Offerman.

42:05.754 --> 42:09.888
Yeah, I'm Andie
Offerman, the girl who

42:09.921 --> 42:12.322
can't finish her first
year of university.

42:13.587 --> 42:15.754
The girl who can't keep
a job and has absolutely,

42:15.788 --> 42:17.322
no direction in life.

42:18.854 --> 42:21.354
Everybody knows you're
destined for great things.

42:21.387 --> 42:23.454
Andie you're special.

42:23.488 --> 42:27.355
Yeah, people have been saying
shit like that for probably,

42:27.388 --> 42:29.288
as long as I can remember.

42:29.321 --> 42:31.955
You know that I like
have something special.

42:31.988 --> 42:36.354
But Hans I'm not
good at anything.

42:37.721 --> 42:42.587
Who knows, maybe special

42:42.620 --> 42:44.955
is just another
word for obnoxious.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.287
I think you're special.

42:55.654 --> 42:56.454
Sorry.

42:56.488 --> 42:57.855
Don't, don't be.

43:33.654 --> 43:36.921
Is this your first
time seeing boobs?

43:58.453 --> 44:01.354
Hey Andie, I can't
figure out how to...

44:02.688 --> 44:05.321
Oh, my mistake.

44:07.388 --> 44:10.421
Shit, fuck shit.

44:10.454 --> 44:11.521
Hans it's fine.

44:11.554 --> 44:13.387
No, it's not.

44:13.420 --> 44:14.520
Where are you going?

44:14.553 --> 44:16.721
I have to go
apologize man to man.

44:16.754 --> 44:17.554
No.

44:17.588 --> 44:18.889
Yes, I do.

44:21.488 --> 44:22.755
Hans, you really, don't.

44:29.453 --> 44:33.922
Mr. Offerman, I'm not sure
if you remember me, but...

44:33.954 --> 44:35.354
Sure, I do, Hans.

44:36.021 --> 44:38.554
Right, Hans, that's me good.

44:38.587 --> 44:43.588
Okay, I'm so sorry that you
just saw, what you just saw.

44:45.020 --> 44:48.487
I just want you to know that
I have the best of intentions

44:48.521 --> 44:49.455
with your daughter.

44:51.755 --> 44:55.354
We were drinking a little
bit, like not too much,

44:55.387 --> 44:57.822
but we were drinking
a little bit.

44:57.854 --> 45:00.954
And Mr. Anderson was there.

45:00.987 --> 45:04.420
He wasn't there,
upstairs just now, right.

45:04.454 --> 45:07.855
But he was at the bar with
us and anyways, you know

45:07.888 --> 45:11.554
one thing led to another,
and next thing you know...

45:11.588 --> 45:13.488
You were trying to
fuck my daughter.

45:18.487 --> 45:20.754
I'm so sorry, again.

45:20.788 --> 45:25.788
I have nothing but
respect for your daughter,

45:26.954 --> 45:28.120
and I would never do
anything, to harm her.

45:28.153 --> 45:33.554
I was raised by a single mother,
so I respect women so much.

45:38.621 --> 45:39.655
Okay.

45:42.554 --> 45:43.589
Okay.

45:58.453 --> 46:01.254
I may have the best intentions
with your daughter.

46:01.288 --> 46:05.722
Are you done? you're the worst.

46:05.754 --> 46:09.554
Maybe next time knock
before entering a room.

46:09.588 --> 46:11.588
Where do you even
find these guys?

46:11.621 --> 46:13.488
Also I thought, he was gay.

46:16.554 --> 46:17.988
Yeah, so did I.

46:19.520 --> 46:20.855
What the fuck...

46:26.787 --> 46:27.688
Don't even.

46:29.621 --> 46:31.789
Andrea Offerman.

46:33.521 --> 46:34.822
What the hell do you
think you're doing

46:34.855 --> 46:37.254
meddling with one of my clients?

46:37.287 --> 46:38.454
Oh!

46:38.487 --> 46:42.854
Don't you oh me,
you eavesdropped on sensitive information

46:42.887 --> 46:45.854
and then tried to help one
of my clients come out.

46:45.888 --> 46:47.420
He's my teacher too.

46:47.454 --> 46:48.555
Mr. Anderson?

46:48.587 --> 46:50.587
That is bullshit.

46:50.620 --> 46:52.420
You should not have listened.

46:52.453 --> 46:54.621
And you sure as hell shouldn't
have approached him about it.

46:54.654 --> 46:56.487
I'm sorry.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.654
Do you understand how
unprofessional this makes me look?

46:58.688 --> 46:59.587
I'm sorry.

46:59.620 --> 47:01.287
You bet your ass you're sorry.

47:01.321 --> 47:03.522
It's not like nobody
knows, everyone guessed it.

47:06.620 --> 47:07.755
You're on your own kiddo.

47:07.788 --> 47:09.854
Damn straight she is.

47:09.886 --> 47:14.887
His wife and family don't
know, but you thought

47:15.421 --> 47:16.588
every teacher was gay.

47:16.621 --> 47:17.887
So, that's no surprise.

47:17.920 --> 47:18.822
Mom.

47:18.855 --> 47:21.587
I almost lost him as a client.

47:21.620 --> 47:24.420
And he's in a very vulnerable
position right now.

47:24.454 --> 47:25.588
Mom, I'm sorry.

47:25.621 --> 47:27.387
You're fired is what you are.

47:27.420 --> 47:28.488
Fine.

47:28.520 --> 47:31.287
It is really time, that you
learned that your choices

47:31.320 --> 47:33.754
have consequences,
drop out of college,

47:33.787 --> 47:36.988
and expect the world is
gonna take care of you.

47:37.020 --> 47:39.254
Well, you have to take care
of yourself from now on

47:39.288 --> 47:40.722
young lady.

47:40.755 --> 47:45.755
I wanna charge you rent,
$50, no, $100 a week.

47:46.287 --> 47:47.688
Rent, are you kidding?

47:47.720 --> 47:51.655
No, do every Friday,
starting this Friday.

47:51.687 --> 47:53.622
No more supporting a slerk.

48:26.654 --> 48:27.588
What's wrong?

48:29.053 --> 48:29.888
Nothing.

48:31.786 --> 48:32.988
I know what you're gonna say,

48:33.020 --> 48:34.588
you're gonna say, it
was too hard on Andie.

48:34.621 --> 48:38.488
But she's got to learn that
her actions have consequences.

48:38.521 --> 48:40.222
That's not what I was gonna say.

48:41.453 --> 48:44.354
I mean, I do think that though.

48:45.819 --> 48:46.721
Then what is it?

48:49.920 --> 48:54.555
Sometimes you are so focused
on people being stable,

48:54.588 --> 48:57.222
that you don't see
them for who they are.

48:58.287 --> 48:58.888
People?

48:59.787 --> 49:02.555
Andie, me.

49:03.721 --> 49:05.487
I want you to see me.

49:05.521 --> 49:06.754
I do see you.

49:08.986 --> 49:10.688
That's not what I mean.

49:10.721 --> 49:12.854
What do you mean then?

49:12.886 --> 49:14.988
You need to articulate
your feelings dear.

49:16.754 --> 49:18.488
You met me at my prime.

49:18.521 --> 49:19.921
I was an acclaimed playwright.

49:20.887 --> 49:24.787
And I know you think I'm
not living up to that.

49:24.820 --> 49:28.355
I just know what
you're both capable of.

49:29.687 --> 49:32.621
Are you ever gonna see me?

49:33.587 --> 49:37.787
Not who you think I
could be, just me as I am

49:37.820 --> 49:40.222
and think that that's enough?

49:44.053 --> 49:44.887
Karen?

49:48.720 --> 49:49.987
I don't know.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.754
You look a little
nervous, kiddo.

50:17.787 --> 50:20.720
Nah, yeah, I guess I am.

50:20.753 --> 50:23.654
I haven't seen you like
this in a while, long while.

50:24.986 --> 50:26.720
Do you think this
is a good idea?

50:27.719 --> 50:29.853
Look what happened with mom.

50:29.887 --> 50:30.887
This is the arts.

50:30.919 --> 50:32.820
Everyone knows
everyone's business.

50:36.021 --> 50:38.520
Okay, is there anything I
need to know before going in?

50:38.553 --> 50:40.887
Heck yeah, but I'm not
gonna tell you that.

50:41.819 --> 50:43.821
Crew will take care of you.

50:43.853 --> 50:46.820
You gotta stand on your own
two feet Miss Business lady.

50:48.886 --> 50:49.887
Come on.

50:53.954 --> 50:54.987
Hi, Dean.

50:55.020 --> 50:56.621
Hey man.

50:56.654 --> 50:57.953
This must be Andie.

50:57.986 --> 51:00.686
I sure as heck am Liam,
a pleasure I'm sure.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.521
Charmed.

51:02.553 --> 51:04.320
So what can I do,
where do you need me?

51:04.353 --> 51:06.554
Enthusiastic, I like that.

51:06.587 --> 51:09.487
Well, we're gonna
start with this.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.721
It's supposed to be a
boat, a damn minimalist

51:12.754 --> 51:14.222
obscure directors.

51:15.687 --> 51:17.921
Making my life
hard all the time.

51:17.953 --> 51:21.754
So I don't know, I mean,
Dean wants this to be a boat.

51:21.786 --> 51:24.554
So, right now it's looking
more like a bunch of rags

51:24.587 --> 51:25.886
hanging out in space.

51:25.920 --> 51:26.721
It really does.

51:26.754 --> 51:27.653
Yeah, Right?

51:27.688 --> 51:29.887
So, I don't really know
what to do with it.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.686
We get some old iron fittings.

51:32.719 --> 51:35.753
Couple of ropes, not many.

51:35.787 --> 51:38.455
What are those
wooden handle things,

51:38.488 --> 51:39.621
that attach ropes
on to big ships?

51:39.654 --> 51:40.455
Cleats.

51:40.487 --> 51:41.687
Yeah.

51:41.719 --> 51:42.686
I was thinking of
the same thing.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.554
It's like, you read my mind.

51:44.587 --> 51:46.254
Would you like to start
with a shopping trip?

51:48.754 --> 51:49.555
Oh, that'd be perfect.

51:49.587 --> 51:50.387
It's a start.

51:51.854 --> 51:54.820
We could even like, I wasn't
thinking of these ones

51:54.853 --> 51:56.454
but like something that
looks more like this.

51:56.488 --> 51:57.721
A little bit old school?

51:57.754 --> 52:00.754
Yeah, like whenever we
get, if we bought a new,

52:00.787 --> 52:01.821
could we make it
look a little older,

52:01.853 --> 52:03.786
we like rub it in
dirt or something.

52:03.820 --> 52:05.288
Yeah, we do that all the time.

52:05.321 --> 52:06.754
Okay.

52:06.787 --> 52:08.821
I was thinking maybe we
bring this up a little bit.

52:08.853 --> 52:10.454
So, it's filling the
space a little more

52:10.488 --> 52:12.820
and we can run some
of these rags up

52:12.853 --> 52:15.288
to make it look
more like a sail?

52:15.320 --> 52:16.520
Sail, yeah.

52:16.553 --> 52:18.954
You are reading my
mind, this might work.

52:29.487 --> 52:30.322
Hello?

53:08.853 --> 53:11.321
Hey dude, good day?

53:12.987 --> 53:13.821
Hungry?

53:15.054 --> 53:17.821
Cool, we're downstairs
if wanna join us.

53:21.954 --> 53:23.388
Is Neil, eating?

53:23.421 --> 53:25.921
I don't think so,
he's in a mood, I think.

53:25.954 --> 53:27.955
Stop talking about me.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.587
Yeah, who knows, maybe
I won't get fired

53:34.619 --> 53:35.821
from this job after a week.

53:35.853 --> 53:37.987
Wow, that would be
an accomplishment.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.222
Shut up.

53:44.054 --> 53:46.654
What's up with you,
you're acting kinda weird.

53:51.420 --> 53:53.587
Oh no,

53:56.453 --> 53:57.254
okay.

53:58.586 --> 53:59.853
It's not personal at all.

53:59.887 --> 54:00.955
No, yeah, right.

54:03.020 --> 54:05.454
I think one day we
could for sure have

54:05.486 --> 54:09.221
I don't know a thing?

54:10.321 --> 54:11.621
You do?

54:11.654 --> 54:14.454
Yeah, don't you?

54:14.486 --> 54:16.620
No, I mean, yeah totally.

54:16.653 --> 54:20.886
I just, fuck I'm in this weird
transitional period and...

54:20.919 --> 54:22.686
No, yeah, I know it's okay.

54:22.719 --> 54:23.954
I get it Andie.

54:25.753 --> 54:29.720
Okay, you're the best.

54:32.954 --> 54:35.254
But If we did have
sex you'd probably

54:35.287 --> 54:36.921
be singing a different
tune right now.

54:36.954 --> 54:37.753
That's all I'm saying.

54:37.786 --> 54:38.886
Would I?

54:38.921 --> 54:40.886
I mean, they don't call me
the love machine, for nothing.

54:40.919 --> 54:41.953
You're right, they
do call you that.

54:41.987 --> 54:43.454
Yeah, they do, so.

54:50.354 --> 54:51.786
I know, I got laid a
lot in high school.

54:51.819 --> 54:52.954
That's my cat.

54:54.720 --> 54:55.987
What?

54:56.020 --> 54:58.020
I'm sorry, but I'm
almost positive.

54:58.054 --> 55:02.987
But it's my cat, Alexander,
Alexander Hamilton?

55:04.021 --> 55:08.887
Nope, not Alexander, actually
it's, Karen. Karen the cat.

55:08.920 --> 55:12.387
Nah, here's my wallpaper.

55:15.021 --> 55:18.486
Okay, he looks kinda similar.

55:19.387 --> 55:20.255
I see it. Do you see it?

55:20.287 --> 55:22.487
I don't really see it.

55:22.520 --> 55:23.486
Mommy's here.

55:26.021 --> 55:27.355
I don't know who you are.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.954
There he is my Alexander.

55:59.987 --> 56:02.287
No more lost.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.853
There you go here, go inside.

56:05.787 --> 56:06.954
Thank you so much.

56:06.987 --> 56:07.988
Of course.

56:08.020 --> 56:11.920
I brought some
his food, for you.

56:11.953 --> 56:13.520
That's so nice of you.

56:13.552 --> 56:14.754
I noticed she wasn't
really a big fan

56:14.787 --> 56:16.021
of the kibble I was buying.

56:16.054 --> 56:18.287
So, I started doing raw
food about a month ago.

56:18.986 --> 56:22.287
It looks like your
captor is a fancy lady.

56:22.320 --> 56:25.255
Were you eating fancy lady food?

56:25.288 --> 56:28.854
We're really more of
a kibble household.

56:28.887 --> 56:31.587
Of course, we should get going.

56:31.619 --> 56:35.954
Oh! Don't let nappy
heads out.

56:53.487 --> 56:54.321
Thanks.

56:56.352 --> 56:57.953
I still hate your guts.

56:57.986 --> 56:58.821
Obviously.

56:59.754 --> 57:01.320
Dad's heartbroken.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.354
I might use this
opportunity to move into the

57:03.386 --> 57:04.420
number one spot.

57:04.452 --> 57:06.454
I'd be disappointed
if you didn't.

57:06.487 --> 57:08.820
But I'm sorry about Karen.

57:09.953 --> 57:10.787
Thanks, Neil.

57:29.353 --> 57:30.254
Oh, fuck!

57:37.854 --> 57:40.887
Look ma, If Wiliam
Golding wanted us to read

57:40.920 --> 57:43.654
into his writing, looking
for other meaning,

57:43.687 --> 57:46.020
then he would've
just written it.

57:46.053 --> 57:47.920
I mean, he's a writer.

57:49.320 --> 57:51.787
Well, that is the
point of metaphor.

57:51.820 --> 57:53.754
Pointless if you ask me.

57:53.787 --> 57:57.387
Anyway "an island of
children" sounds terrible.

57:57.419 --> 57:59.519
Most of the kids
I know are dicks.

57:59.553 --> 58:02.519
Neil, please do not talk
like that at the table.

58:02.552 --> 58:05.754
Well, I guess that explains
the plethora of friends

58:05.786 --> 58:06.988
that are calling on you.

58:11.954 --> 58:13.720
Do you guys hear that?

58:13.753 --> 58:15.553
Yeah, what is that?

58:16.886 --> 58:20.486
Phil Collins or Peter Gabriel.

58:22.353 --> 58:22.988
Neither.

58:24.419 --> 58:26.354
I don't know who that is.

♪ Your eyes ♪

58:27.353 --> 58:29.621

58:51.586 --> 58:53.387
What the shit?

58:55.287 --> 58:57.487
I am divorcing this family.

58:57.519 --> 58:59.286
Karen. Where did you find her?

58:59.319 --> 59:00.954
I stole him back.

59:00.987 --> 59:01.886
Him?

59:01.919 --> 59:03.486
Oh yeah, Dad, Karen's a him.

59:03.520 --> 59:06.821
I don't care less, so
good to have you back.

59:06.854 --> 59:08.386
Hans, why, how?

59:09.153 --> 59:11.520
She had like six cats,
and she almost lost one

59:11.552 --> 59:12.353
while we were there.

59:12.386 --> 59:14.386
So, I figured, screw it.

59:14.420 --> 59:16.287
He'll probably have
a better life here.

59:16.320 --> 59:16.955
You're amazing.

59:18.820 --> 59:21.254
Hans, what was that,
you were singing?

59:21.286 --> 59:22.620
It's the song from
"say anything"

59:22.653 --> 59:24.419
I thought it'd be romantic.

59:24.452 --> 59:27.319
It's not, not the song though,

59:27.353 --> 59:28.721
that was romantic.

59:28.754 --> 59:29.988
Is it not?

59:30.021 --> 59:33.354
No, dear, that's
not a real song.

59:33.387 --> 59:34.420
Close though.

59:35.187 --> 59:37.354
I thought Andie told you
she wasn't interested.

59:37.386 --> 59:38.387
Neil.

59:38.420 --> 59:39.353
Shut up Neil.

59:39.386 --> 59:41.353
Hey, let's go inside okay?

59:41.386 --> 59:43.653
But like, he's right.

59:45.353 --> 59:46.319
Come in for a beer Hans.

59:46.352 --> 59:47.653
Yes, please do.

59:52.987 --> 59:54.420
Hans.

59:54.453 --> 59:58.421
I know, I thought it was
worth a shot, you know?

59:59.453 --> 01:00:00.754
Was a good shot.

01:00:00.787 --> 01:00:01.554
Who knows?

01:00:01.587 --> 01:00:02.454
Might work yet.

01:00:03.619 --> 01:00:06.720
No, I'm sorry, I was
trying to be nice.

01:00:06.754 --> 01:00:08.353
You're fine.

01:00:08.386 --> 01:00:09.753
You wanna come in for a beer?

01:00:11.352 --> 01:00:12.420
Come on, you're the
hero of the day.

01:00:12.453 --> 01:00:14.387
Even fucking Dean, thinks so.

01:00:15.919 --> 01:00:17.720
Okay, I mean, if you're
gonna twist my arm about it,

01:00:17.754 --> 01:00:18.720
then fine.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.854
You're really bad at singing.

01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:23.887
I know.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.421
Is that a gay thing.

01:00:37.386 --> 01:00:40.320
You're right, he is the bomb.

01:00:40.352 --> 01:00:43.420
Yeah, he's really like, helpful.

01:00:43.453 --> 01:00:45.887
Like he hasn't tried
any of that lame

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.520
get me a lefty hammer shit.

01:00:48.553 --> 01:00:50.821
He's been with me
for a long time,

01:00:50.853 --> 01:00:52.721
ever since the big play.

01:00:55.854 --> 01:00:57.453
So how'd you write your play?

01:00:59.353 --> 01:01:01.854
And I don't want
your playbill answer?

01:01:10.552 --> 01:01:15.553
It's nice to think about
it like, properly again.

01:01:16.519 --> 01:01:19.353
I mean, it's always
there, but I don't go back

01:01:19.386 --> 01:01:21.620
into it, really if
that makes sense.

01:01:33.587 --> 01:01:35.554
I guess, well, here goes.

01:01:37.453 --> 01:01:39.520
Hemingway, once said,

01:01:39.552 --> 01:01:42.921
"All you have to do is
write one true sentence."

01:01:42.953 --> 01:01:45.487
Just write the truest
sentence that you know.

01:01:45.519 --> 01:01:46.786
So pretentious.

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:48.520
You asked.

01:01:48.552 --> 01:01:49.354
Carry on.

01:01:50.654 --> 01:01:53.587
So I did, took me
about two months

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.254
to write that one sentence.

01:01:56.552 --> 01:02:00.553
Your mom and I were broke
as fuck, but she was great

01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:02.553
about it, always.

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:06.286
But I finally got it down.

01:02:06.319 --> 01:02:07.620
I'll never forget that moment.

01:02:07.653 --> 01:02:09.820
I was sitting at our
little kitchenette counter

01:02:09.854 --> 01:02:11.955
drinking, cooled shitty coffee.

01:02:13.587 --> 01:02:18.386
I got it down and I couldn't
find a single fault in it.

01:02:19.753 --> 01:02:24.620
And from there, it's
hard to describe

01:02:24.654 --> 01:02:27.687
because it takes life.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.621
You know, it doesn't just
roll, it garners life.

01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:37.621
That's it really, it was
one deeply true sentence.

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:39.221
That garnered life.

01:02:43.352 --> 01:02:44.554
Wow, that's really cool dad.

01:02:45.519 --> 01:02:46.553
Thanks.

01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:52.587
But...

01:02:52.619 --> 01:02:53.620
But?

01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:56.587
Have you ever tried?

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.654
What?

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.854
I don't know, writing a story?

01:03:00.886 --> 01:03:02.886
I guess, I
should give it a shot.

01:03:02.919 --> 01:03:05.554
Yeah, maybe then it
wouldn't be 15 years

01:03:05.586 --> 01:03:07.486
since your last
original play.

01:03:08.487 --> 01:03:10.454
I could use another beer.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:11.554
Okay, yeah me too.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.319
Why do you ask, fancy
giving it a stab?

01:03:36.352 --> 01:03:36.953
Nope.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.286
I think you'd be good though.

01:03:41.619 --> 01:03:45.019
Maybe, but I am rapidly learning

01:03:45.053 --> 01:03:48.019
that potential is only
the start of the story.

01:03:48.052 --> 01:03:48.853
Preach.

01:03:52.553 --> 01:03:53.554
You should though.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.620
What?

01:03:56.653 --> 01:03:57.986
Write again.

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:58.821
I do, write.

01:03:59.787 --> 01:04:01.521
I mean, really write.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.487
I'm gonna take my beer,
and Karen for a walk.

01:04:08.619 --> 01:04:09.952
Karen?

01:04:09.985 --> 01:04:10.885
Mom.

01:04:10.918 --> 01:04:13.621
The cat, it's okay mom.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:14.020
And I think I can have
it up before Christmas.

01:05:14.053 --> 01:05:15.586
That's so great, Dean.

01:05:15.619 --> 01:05:17.386
I'm so proud of you.

01:05:18.319 --> 01:05:18.954
Thank you.

01:05:20.052 --> 01:05:21.653
I knew you had
another one in you.

01:05:25.553 --> 01:05:26.586
What?

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:27.687
Another play.

01:05:29.785 --> 01:05:33.720
Oh, so you think
this is all because of you?

01:05:34.453 --> 01:05:37.686
No, I think it's
all because of you.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.754
I just helped push you along.

01:05:39.786 --> 01:05:40.621
No.

01:05:41.818 --> 01:05:45.553
Okay. Okay.

01:05:45.587 --> 01:05:49.253
Fuck, I just happened to
be struck by inspiration

01:05:49.286 --> 01:05:51.721
and it just so happened
to be at the same time

01:05:51.752 --> 01:05:54.386
that you're disapproving
hovering was at an all-time high.

01:05:54.419 --> 01:05:56.386
I do not hover.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.820
Okay.

01:06:00.686 --> 01:06:02.720
Dean, stop acting like a child.

01:06:02.752 --> 01:06:04.986
I'm not, I'm just saying,

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.753
I don't want you to take
credit for my inspiration.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:12.621
Nobody is taking any credit.

01:06:12.654 --> 01:06:13.554
Okay.

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:15.687
Okay.

01:06:39.818 --> 01:06:42.019
Mr. Daniels comes here tonight.

01:06:42.052 --> 01:06:43.819
I'm gonna save a
space for him here,

01:06:43.852 --> 01:06:45.952
and he can be the rose
between two thorns.

01:06:45.986 --> 01:06:48.386
He can be the rose
between two thorns.

01:06:48.419 --> 01:06:49.654
He'll sit beside me.

01:06:49.686 --> 01:06:50.820
I'm telling you he
can have a twofer.

01:06:50.853 --> 01:06:53.853
Do you even know
what that means.

01:06:53.886 --> 01:06:54.986
I do.

01:06:55.019 --> 01:06:56.419
Here, thanks for coming.

01:06:56.453 --> 01:06:57.287
Thanks.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:03.553
Hi, guys.

01:07:05.885 --> 01:07:06.719
Hi.

01:07:09.487 --> 01:07:10.453
Hey.

01:07:10.486 --> 01:07:11.420
Working the door aye.

01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:13.019
Yeah, that and everything else,

01:07:13.052 --> 01:07:15.319
I'm really a good daughter.

01:07:15.352 --> 01:07:16.852
How are you feeling?

01:07:16.886 --> 01:07:18.853
Good, I'm excited.

01:07:18.886 --> 01:07:19.886
I think they're gonna kill it.

01:07:19.918 --> 01:07:21.586
You wanna hang out
after the show?

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.853
Well, I'm actually gonna
get a drink with the crew,

01:07:22.886 --> 01:07:24.652
but you guys are
welcome to come.

01:07:24.686 --> 01:07:26.287
Yeah, sounds good.

01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:27.286
Yeah, get in there.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.886
It's gonna really fill out.

01:07:28.918 --> 01:07:31.953
Yeah, okay, oh my God.

01:07:32.885 --> 01:07:33.886
See you later.

01:07:33.918 --> 01:07:34.752
Bye.

01:07:40.685 --> 01:07:41.786
Hey, thanks so much for coming.

01:08:11.886 --> 01:08:13.719
Nervous?

01:08:13.753 --> 01:08:14.785
Very.

01:08:14.819 --> 01:08:16.487
You shouldn't be.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.354
If I wasn't I shouldn't
be doing this.

01:08:21.287 --> 01:08:23.220
You know, this is about you.

01:08:23.886 --> 01:08:27.519
Yeah, I know dad.

01:08:27.553 --> 01:08:28.852
It's super obvious.

01:08:28.886 --> 01:08:30.287
Oh, right.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:31.819
Like I even thought that
was an unspoken thing.

01:08:31.852 --> 01:08:33.585
Cool.

01:08:33.618 --> 01:08:36.553
Like you could've fucking
cast me, but whatever.

01:08:36.585 --> 01:08:38.319
We both know you would
have been terrible.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.620
I know this last year,
hasn't been easy for you,

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.953
but I'm proud of you.

01:08:47.287 --> 01:08:48.920
You're putting the work in.

01:08:48.952 --> 01:08:50.453
The work?

01:08:50.486 --> 01:08:51.886
You're figuring your shit out.

01:08:53.718 --> 01:08:57.719
Just you don't have to
finish figuring it out now.

01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:00.886
Thanks dad.

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:03.653
Anyway, I'm nervous as hell.

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:05.386
You wanna go smoke a joint?

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.885
Don't tell your mother.

01:09:06.919 --> 01:09:08.819
Who do you think I am, Neil?

01:09:37.952 --> 01:09:39.319
Hey, what's up.

01:09:39.352 --> 01:09:41.585
Hey, thanks for coming
take one of these

01:09:41.618 --> 01:09:42.585
everyone's in there, go.

01:09:42.618 --> 01:09:43.453
Okay.
