I would build him
perfectly for you.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.050
- Would he have a large penis?
Minion size.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.084
- Well, I'm not
trying to maim you.

15:20.103 --> 15:21.436
Yeah.
[laughing]

15:21.471 --> 15:22.553
- well, that's big.
Yeah.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.521
- I know.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.057
So, I was thinking maybe
if you knew anybody

15:26.092 --> 15:27.058
in that beautiful
head of yours.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.860
- Um, nothing comes to mind.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.563
Did they get married yet?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.332
- No, they haven't
gotten married yet.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.801
Robyn says she's waiting
'til the pandemic ends.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.288
- I told ya.
I said it wouldn't happen.

15:40.323 --> 15:43.107
- Ashley just told me
that you feel like

15:43.126 --> 15:44.125
they're never gonna get married.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.245
- Juan has been reluctant
previously to commit,

15:47.280 --> 15:48.129
as we all know.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.048
- I have to go
check on juan dixon

15:50.083 --> 15:51.132
'cause it's happening.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.583
- Maybe it won't.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.720
If you're gonna get married,
you're gonna get married.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.139
So, that's a long time,
isn't it?

15:58.174 --> 16:09.867
♪♪

16:09.903 --> 16:13.154

- You know I did.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.200
- No, I didn't.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.435
- I miss them so much already.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.903

16:53.113 --> 16:53.644
- That's why
I soldier for him.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.529
Don't talk about ray.

16:54.564 --> 16:56.447
- I, honey, I'm the same
about my husband.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.216

- Oh, thank you.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.994
Um, so, you know this balcony
connects our-our rooms.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.195
- Yes.

17:11.214 --> 17:12.997
- Come on, mama.
Come on, now.

17:13.032 --> 17:13.715
- Okay, yes.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.699

17:17.637 --> 17:19.470
- You look beautiful.
- We are ready.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.040
- All right.
Let's go.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.224
- You know what?

17:23.259 --> 17:24.642
I think I'm changing
my sliding glass door.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.094
- In the basement?
- In the basement, yeah.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.512
It needs to go.
I-I want this.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.596
This house is amazing.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.731
Yeah.
- Isn't it amazing?

17:29.766 --> 17:32.417
- I wonder if wendy likes
the servant quarters, honey.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.102
[laughing]

17:34.154 --> 17:36.154
- the cottage is very cute.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.071
- It's cute.

17:37.107 --> 17:39.524
- Wendy, you are giving me
all these looks.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.891
- You're giving side-eye.
You ain't even seen it.

17:40.910 --> 17:42.060
- It's so cute.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.894
- The fact that it's a lesser,
I don't need to see it.

17:43.913 --> 17:45.696
I just know it ain't it.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.248
- Can we talk about wendy,
but, like, really quickly?

17:47.283 --> 17:48.249
Somethin' is not--
somethin' is off.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.233
- Something is--
yeah.

17:49.252 --> 17:51.068
I'm almost happy that
you brought that up.

17:51.087 --> 17:52.403
- Right.

17:52.422 --> 17:53.638
- So that I know that
I'm not the only person

17:53.673 --> 17:55.673
that's thinking something
is different.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.575
- I do wanna say,
"look, wendy,

17:57.594 --> 18:00.762
"I've seen more of your skin
in the past month"--

18:00.797 --> 18:01.963
- than you did
the whole year before.

18:02.015 --> 18:02.847
- Yeah.

18:02.882 --> 18:03.931
You know, dress
the way wanna dress.

18:03.967 --> 18:04.982
- Yeah.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.083
- But, like, what's up
with the sudden change?

18:06.102 --> 18:08.186
- I mean, I get it.
You spent money on a new body.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.487
- Cool.
- You wanna show it off.

18:09.522 --> 18:13.941
It's just such a big difference
from dr. Wendy the professor.

18:13.977 --> 18:15.610
Like, that's just-- it's weird.
- Yes.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.114
- Ahh.

18:20.150 --> 18:21.816
Not only are we in the cottage,
but we gotta ring the bell!

18:21.868 --> 18:24.952
- Uh-uh.
- What in the bullsh--?

18:24.988 --> 18:26.037
Look at her.

18:26.072 --> 18:26.704
She's about to be like,
"welcome to my estate."

18:26.739 --> 18:28.606
[laughing]
- hello, ladies.

18:28.625 --> 18:29.490
- Oh, you know what it is?

18:29.542 --> 18:30.491
We don't have a key
to the front door.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.292
We need to ask for the key
to the front door.

18:31.327 --> 18:35.713
- Welcome back!
- Thank you.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.966
- I feel like her personality
is a little different.

18:39.002 --> 18:39.750
- Yeah, but, like, what?

18:39.785 --> 18:40.501
Like, I can't put
my finger on it.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.502
- Right.
- Like today, on the bus,

18:41.554 --> 18:44.121
I was like something is
different about you.

18:44.140 --> 18:46.957
- That ----ing bodysuit,

18:46.976 --> 18:48.676
that made
my ----ing crotch hurt.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.162
Like--
[laughing]

18:51.197 --> 18:52.096
- are you going to the bathroom?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.831
- No, I just have a wedgie.
- Oh, okay.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.467
- No wonder she has a wedgie--
it's a bodysuit.

18:56.486 --> 18:57.801
Despite the physical changes,

18:57.821 --> 19:00.688
I just feel like
something is off.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.640
For me, I just wanna know--
are you okay?

19:02.659 --> 19:04.025
- That's what
I wanna know, too.

19:04.077 --> 19:07.995
- Girl-a, come on,
um, leather together.

19:08.031 --> 19:09.113
- Yes.
Yes, come on.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.998
- Oh, my god.

19:11.034 --> 19:12.116
Dr. Wendy is gone,

19:12.151 --> 19:16.120
and I hope new booty wendy
is here to stay, honey,

19:16.155 --> 19:17.688
and new titties, too.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.491
- When I met her last year,
like, she exuded substance.

19:20.510 --> 19:22.677
- Yes.
- I instantly liked her.

19:22.712 --> 19:24.345
We instantly connected.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.798
I almost wonder,
if I was to meet her today,

19:27.833 --> 19:29.833
if it would be the same way.
- Mm-hmm.

19:29.853 --> 19:31.052
Hmm.

19:31.104 --> 19:33.721
- This is not the same wendy
that I hit it off with.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.607
The old wendy was
confident and secure.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.543
Zen wen is confused as hell.
- Hmm.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.677
- I am zen wen.

19:39.696 --> 19:42.313
So, do not try to come for me
because what I do have

19:42.348 --> 19:44.565
and what I will always have,
is time.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.617
So, tick tock, mia.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.353
- I'm all about
body positivity,

19:49.372 --> 19:51.556
but she feels colder.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.857
And honestly, I'm concerned
because this is not

19:53.877 --> 19:55.859
the wendy that I first met.

19:55.879 --> 19:57.027
- Look, we're friends.
- I guess.

19:57.046 --> 19:58.396
- We can have a conversation
about it.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.914
- It's not like--
there's no judgment.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.832
It's just like, hey, girl,
like, explain this.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.884
- Right.

20:02.919 --> 20:05.386
- While I'm here, let me
survey the grounds, chile.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.054
- Anybody who is
making these kinda changes,

20:07.090 --> 20:08.389
somethin' is not--
somethin' is off.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.974
- Something is-- yeah.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.510
- And to be honest, there are
some cheating allegations

20:12.545 --> 20:13.594
with her husband.

20:13.646 --> 20:17.231
- Yeah, I heard the rumor,
but I don't believe it.

20:17.267 --> 20:18.516
- No, not at all.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.786
- It's a touchy topic.
- It is.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.921
A part of me feels like
it could be that

20:23.957 --> 20:26.824
because she knows the rumor,
she's trying to overcompensate,

20:26.859 --> 20:28.609
not that it's true.
You know what I mean?

20:28.661 --> 20:31.412
- What's goin' on?
- Aww, hey.

20:31.447 --> 20:35.766
♪♪

20:37.736 --> 20:38.736

how wendy dresses,

21:02.645 --> 21:05.596
but this is a 180
in a different direction

21:05.631 --> 21:08.633
from the person that
I got to know last year.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.568
- Hello.
- Who is-- who is--

21:10.603 --> 21:11.819
who is that?
- Hello.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.988
- Hi, guys, it's me.
- Hey.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.692
Wendy is making some very big
and different changes.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.244
And typically,
when that happens,

21:20.280 --> 21:21.612
there's something else
going on.

21:21.647 --> 21:22.479
- Oh, this is how y'all live.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.282
- Do you see this
whole patio up here?

21:24.317 --> 21:25.166
- Oh, you haven't
been up here?

21:25.201 --> 21:26.317
How are you accommodations?

21:26.336 --> 21:28.319
- Scale of one to ten.

21:28.338 --> 21:30.988
- A four and a--

21:31.007 --> 21:32.656
- do you feel like
you're at servant's quarters?

21:32.675 --> 21:33.657
- Aww, I'm sorry.
I take responsibility.

21:33.676 --> 21:36.043
- Absolutely.
[laughing]

21:36.095 --> 21:36.927
- all right.
Come on.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.179
Let's-- let's--
let's rock, ladies.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.664
- I'm so glad I came up here.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.216
- Hello, la-ties.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.568
- Hi!
- Gifties.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.037
- Look at you.
You come bearing gifts.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.039
- You know,
it's not my love language,

21:48.074 --> 21:49.673
but I feel like
it's everybody else's.

21:49.692 --> 21:52.860
- It's mine to get gifts.
- Yes.

21:52.895 --> 21:55.646
These are just welcome gifts.
- Thank you.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.064
That's so nice of you.
- Can we open it?

21:57.116 --> 21:57.648
- Okay.
- Open them.

21:57.684 --> 22:01.352
- Yay!
- Yes! Yes!

22:01.387 --> 22:03.354
- Okay.
Oh, a robe?

22:03.389 --> 22:04.372
- Yes.

22:04.407 --> 22:05.156
- You can never
have enough robes.

22:05.191 --> 22:06.190
- You can never.
- What is this?

22:06.209 --> 22:08.709
- Whose head is this?
- Huh? Is that too big?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.194
- Way.
- What is that?

22:10.213 --> 22:11.245
Swim caps?

22:11.297 --> 22:13.581
- She's trying to say
we got some big-ass heads.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.916
- That looks like
a big-ass condom.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.802
Whose dick is
fittin' in that?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.870
- We all know candiace
loves condoms.

22:19.889 --> 22:21.672
- Y'all still use condoms?
What?

22:22.725 --> 22:23.674
- What is the--
what's the problem?

22:23.710 --> 22:25.409
- You need to consummate
your damn marriage.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.260
- Thank you.
- But we--

22:26.312 --> 22:28.512
- but she can keep them
for herself

22:28.547 --> 22:29.930
and chris' brown dick.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.016
[laughing]

22:32.051 --> 22:33.851
- I know I got
a big head, but damn.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.770
- What is the swim cap for?

22:35.822 --> 22:38.422
- Candiace has allowed me
to take over a little bit.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.658
So, tomorrow, I was
going to have, like,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.276
a little water aerobics

class planned.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.398
- Yeah, just--

22:47.417 --> 22:48.366
- I'm leading
the class, yes.

22:48.401 --> 22:52.036
- Isn't water aerobics
for old-ass people?

22:53.272 --> 22:55.423
- Congratulations for karen.
Her geritol just kicked in.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.340
Okay.
- Honey, your old ass

22:56.376 --> 22:58.376
is 50 years old, okay?
- Oh, oh, okay.

22:58.411 --> 22:59.960
- I'm just saying.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.545
- But you don't have to wear
that swim cap for your head

23:01.581 --> 23:02.680
'cause that looked crazy.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.632
- Okay, so our cars are here.
- Oh, okay, let's go.

23:04.684 --> 23:05.449

23:32.612 --> 23:33.878
So, where is the rest

- One of these four options.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.549
- Yeah.
- I just wanted to see.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.616
Was there anything that
I could get you all to drink

23:46.509 --> 23:46.924
Can I have a grey goose

23:46.959 --> 23:47.558
- Yes, ma'am.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.793

23:49.812 --> 23:50.928
- Yes, ma'am.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.798

the chocolate espresso martini,

23:53.833 --> 23:54.965
please.
- Yes, ma'am.

23:54.984 --> 23:56.150

the grilled tuna, please.

- All right.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.352
- What are we doing tomorrow?

23:58.404 --> 23:59.803
- We'll have breakfast.

23:59.822 --> 24:01.489
After breakfast,
we will do

24:01.524 --> 24:03.807
gizelle's synchronized
swimming activity.

24:03.826 --> 24:05.025
- Actually, it's
water aerobics.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.944
- Oh.
- It's water aerobics.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.946
- I will have the blackened
atlantic salmon.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.781
- Why am I calling it
synchronized swimming?

24:10.816 --> 24:11.648
- It's water aerobics.
- Oh, okay.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.500
- I like synchronized
swimming better.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.485
- We're doing water aerobics.
- Yes.

24:14.504 --> 24:15.619
- I can't wait to
see you all do this.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.820
- So, you're not
doing water aerobics?

24:16.839 --> 24:17.922
- No, I have--
this has to last me

24:17.957 --> 24:18.989
through the swearing in.

24:19.008 --> 24:20.791
Friday, I'm being sworn in

24:20.827 --> 24:22.993
as the ambassador
to surrey county, virginia.

24:23.012 --> 24:25.329
I invited mia already,
and, you know,

24:25.348 --> 24:26.964
I would love it, wendy,

24:26.999 --> 24:28.699
if you would come,
as well.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.017
So, I'm not
messing up my hair

24:30.052 --> 24:33.521
with a pool swim
with satan.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.672
- After that, we're
actually having

24:35.691 --> 24:38.893
a whiskey distillery
come to us.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.811
- Whiskey wendy.
- Whiskey wendy.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.696
- Oh, jesus.
How many names you gonna get?

24:42.732 --> 24:44.064
- I-I have-- I have
so many layers.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.149
- So many.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.685
- Now, some of us have
been to a whiskey tasting.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.321
- Bottom's up.
Bottom's up.

24:50.356 --> 24:51.989
- I'm a champagne girl.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.374
Brown liquor ain't for me.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.525
- It tastes like
butt crack.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.543
[laughing]

24:55.578 --> 24:56.560
that's a no.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.628
That was a long time ago.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.530
But, hopefully, ashley
will have made it by then.

24:59.549 --> 25:00.464
- Cheers.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.565
- Cheers, ladies.
- Are we doing a toast?

25:01.601 --> 25:02.766
- Yeah.
- Yes. Cheers.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.235
- All: Cheers.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.887
- To us.
- Cheers.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.389
- Cheers.
- Cheers to us.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.706
- Now, that's excellent.
- Oh, my gosh, it's very good.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.141
- Ooh, it is very good.
It's great.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.176
- Here we are.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.511
- Mmm.

25:13.546 --> 25:14.562
- I love
a charcuterie board.

25:14.597 --> 25:15.479
- Oh, yeah.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.014
- I need to learn
how to make pretty ones.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.183
Sometimes I feel weird
that chris cooks.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.117
- Mm-hmm.

25:20.152 --> 25:24.572
- And our gender roles
are very reversed.

25:24.607 --> 25:27.575
- How does he feel
about your new busyness?

25:27.610 --> 25:28.409
- Yes.
- And, you know,

25:28.444 --> 25:29.743
just everything
that you're doing.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.596
- He literally
believes in me

25:32.632 --> 25:33.564
more than I believe
in myself.

25:33.599 --> 25:34.448
- There you go.
- Yeah.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.583
- Nice.
- I love that.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.001
- He pushes me.
He's like,

25:37.036 --> 25:38.802
"you need to get
this, this, and this done."

25:38.838 --> 25:39.837
- mm-hmm.

25:39.872 --> 25:40.938
- That's where husbanger
comes in.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.907
- Your photo shoot, do you
have everything for that?

25:42.942 --> 25:44.174
- I don't know.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.010
- It's very hard for me
to manage things

25:46.045 --> 25:48.128
if I don't know
the details.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.431
- And he keeps me
on my feet.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.849
- So, do you pay him?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.050
- In love and affection.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.251
- You just give him booty.
- Mm-hmm.

25:54.270 --> 25:55.519
- Okay, that's good.

25:55.555 --> 25:59.089
- At what point does, like,
manager have his off hours?

25:59.125 --> 26:01.091
- We have these arguments
sometimes.

26:01.110 --> 26:02.126
- So how does that work?
- I can imagine, yeah.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.596
- Because I will go to
the studio in the daytime

26:05.615 --> 26:08.616
and then come home,
and I'm tired,

26:08.651 --> 26:10.367
and he's like,
"what are you doing?

26:10.403 --> 26:13.037
You need to do this video
for this thing."

26:13.072 --> 26:16.640
and I wanna be like,
"skirr, it's 10 o'clock."

26:16.676 --> 26:17.541
- right.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.376
- So, we do kinda
have to work that out.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.045
- He's gonna be
kris jenner now for you.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.012
- No.

26:22.048 --> 26:22.646
- Like, how does your mother
feel about this?

26:22.682 --> 26:24.331
- She doesn't like it.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.789
- Yes.
I really don't like

26:32.808 --> 26:35.125
that you are making
assumptions that chris

26:35.144 --> 26:37.144
is trying to
take money from me.

26:37.179 --> 26:40.931
If I thought that chris
would ever skate and float

26:40.966 --> 26:42.182
while I make all the money,

26:42.234 --> 26:44.234
I would not have married him.
- Right.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.487
Quick, can I just say
one more thing?

26:46.522 --> 26:48.572
You don't wanna ever look
at him and resent him.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.324
- Yeah.
- Because you're getting

26:50.359 --> 26:52.109
your hustle on,
and he might not be.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.911
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

26:53.946 --> 26:54.695
- Yeah.
- So, you think him being

26:54.747 --> 26:56.013
the manager
is holding him back

26:56.048 --> 26:56.914
from getting his hustle on?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.666
- I'm thinking that's
on her coattails.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.451
- Mmm.

27:07.593 --> 27:08.942
I while I make all the money,
would ever skate and float

27:08.978 --> 27:10.961
I would not have married him.
- Right.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.813
You don't wanna ever
look at him and resent him.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.782
- Yeah.
- Because you're getting

27:14.817 --> 27:16.266
your hustle on,
and he might not be.

27:16.285 --> 27:18.118
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

27:18.154 --> 27:18.936
- Yeah.
- So, you think him being

27:18.971 --> 27:20.504
the manager
is holding him back

27:20.539 --> 27:21.405
from getting his hustle on?

27:21.440 --> 27:23.490
- I'm thinking that's
on her coattails.

27:25.661 --> 27:27.344
- I can understand,

27:27.380 --> 27:29.997
but I also understand
my marriage.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.081
- Okay.
- Whoo.

27:31.116 --> 27:32.249
- And I understand
our dynamic.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.350
- Okay.
- And that's on what?

27:33.386 --> 27:34.385
- Okay.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.952
- The bottom line is,
you trust your husband.

27:35.971 --> 27:36.620
- Yes, yeah.
- And that's all that matters.

27:36.656 --> 27:37.821
- Yes.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.390
- When you talked
about chris

27:39.425 --> 27:41.008
telling you to get up
off the couch,

27:41.060 --> 27:42.810
he sounds like juan
telling me to get up out--

27:42.845 --> 27:43.927
out of the bed.

27:43.963 --> 27:44.995
- Oh, my.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.930
- Because I don't know
what it is,

27:46.965 --> 27:49.516
but I've been, like,
unmotivated lately.

27:49.568 --> 27:52.903
I will lay in the bed
until, like, 10 o'clock.

27:52.938 --> 27:53.737
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

27:53.773 --> 27:55.406
- And then
I'll watch tv until 11.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.273
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

27:56.308 --> 27:57.841
- And then I'm startin'
my day at 12

27:57.877 --> 27:58.876
with a cup of coffee.
- Uh-uh.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.327
- Oh, girl.
- The day is gone.

28:00.363 --> 28:01.945
- But I'm also trying
to figure out

28:01.981 --> 28:02.979
why can't I just get up

28:02.998 --> 28:05.449
because I have a ton
of sh-- that I need to do.

28:05.484 --> 28:06.350
- Mm-hmm.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.652
- It's, like, affecting
my relationship.

28:08.671 --> 28:10.170
- Oh.
- Because juan is like,

28:10.206 --> 28:11.872
"that's not attractive."
- what?

28:19.565 --> 28:21.048
- You say 12.

28:23.219 --> 28:25.335
- He's, like, dead serious?
- He is dead serious.

28:25.354 --> 28:27.604
- Did it make you
make any changes,

28:27.640 --> 28:28.706
or are you, like,
real comfortable

28:28.741 --> 28:30.057
gettin' back in that bed?

28:30.109 --> 28:31.942
- I have-I have
not made any changes.

28:31.977 --> 28:34.027
So, look.
- You haven't made any changes?

28:34.063 --> 28:36.714
Is he not wanting
to rush down the aisle

28:36.749 --> 28:38.148
because of this?

28:38.184 --> 28:40.350
No man wants to
marry unattractive.

28:40.369 --> 28:43.287
♪♪

28:43.322 --> 28:44.655
- when my friends
are in need,

28:44.690 --> 28:46.156
I pick them up,
and I lift them.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.659
Gizelle kicks them
one more inch

28:48.694 --> 28:49.877
deeper into the ground.

28:49.912 --> 28:52.212
Gizelle's need
to attack others

28:52.248 --> 28:54.531
is because it deflects
from others

28:54.550 --> 28:56.884
asking her questions
about her own life.

28:56.919 --> 28:59.052
No one is off limits,
including robyn.

28:59.088 --> 29:01.221
Who is next?

29:01.257 --> 29:03.474
- You know, he's never
said that, like,

29:03.509 --> 29:05.058
"I'm not gonna marry you
because of this,"

29:05.094 --> 29:07.244
but I think if
I were to get better--

29:07.279 --> 29:08.345
- mm-hmm.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.848
- That our-our relationship
would be even better.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.349
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know what I mean?

29:12.384 --> 29:13.717
- This-- uh-- uh--
- but, robyn, you have--

29:13.736 --> 29:15.319
you have-you have kids.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.070
Are you neglecting
your children

29:17.106 --> 29:18.906
because--
- in a way.

29:18.941 --> 29:20.941
- Oh, wow.
- Robyn!

29:20.993 --> 29:23.444
- Corey has a 48% in english.
- What?

29:23.496 --> 29:25.395
- What?
- This was, like,
a few weeks ago.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.365
So, where corey,
the year before,

29:28.400 --> 29:29.450
had straight as.

29:29.502 --> 29:31.752
- Do you think that you
are functioning at 100%?

29:31.787 --> 29:33.253
- I know that I'm not.

29:33.289 --> 29:35.672
Even though my business
is doing extremely well--

29:35.708 --> 29:37.591
- mm-hmm.
- It could be doing--

29:37.626 --> 29:38.625
- better.
- Mm-hmm.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.110
- Ten times better.
- Mm-hmm.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.211
- I've been depressed before,

29:41.246 --> 29:43.380
and the symptoms that you're--
what you're saying,

29:43.415 --> 29:45.482
really sounds
like depression.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.485
- Are you depressed?

29:48.521 --> 29:50.554
- I believe I'm
seasonally depressed.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.755
- Okay.
- Do you?

29:51.774 --> 29:52.289
- But now that it's springtime,
let's see what happens.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.590
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:53.609 --> 29:55.442
- But I always go through this.
- Do you get that every year?

29:55.478 --> 29:56.777
- Yes, every year.

29:56.812 --> 29:57.778
- That's a real--
that's a real thing.

29:57.813 --> 30:00.447
- Robyn, you're-you're
getting back in the bed,

30:00.483 --> 30:02.449
and you're in the bed
until noon.

30:02.485 --> 30:04.301
That's a problem.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.953
- I wanna say it's,
like, a combination

30:05.988 --> 30:07.771
of seasonal depression.

30:07.790 --> 30:08.806
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.123
- Just, like,
getting in a rut.

30:10.159 --> 30:12.292
Like, my personality
doesn't like structure.

30:12.328 --> 30:13.911
- Mm-hmm.
- Is it an extension

30:13.946 --> 30:15.295
of my personality,
being laid back,

30:15.331 --> 30:17.798
or is it, like, laziness
or lack of motivation?

30:17.833 --> 30:19.416
- Right.
- Which I don't know.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.218
I almost feel like
I need to see, like,

30:21.253 --> 30:22.503
not necessarily
a therapist

30:22.555 --> 30:24.087
but, like, a life coach.
- A life coach.

30:24.123 --> 30:24.988
- Yeah.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.590
- It needs to be
a combination of the two,

30:26.625 --> 30:28.192
but I think it may be
more than that.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.694
It's like you understand
that what you need to do

30:30.729 --> 30:31.962
is important.
- Right.

30:31.981 --> 30:33.831
- But you just don't
have the motivation

30:33.866 --> 30:35.766
or the energy to do it.
- Right.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.317
I don't think
I'm depressed,

30:37.353 --> 30:40.838
but maybe the ladies
at the table have a point.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.990
Maybe there's
something else there

30:43.025 --> 30:44.575
that I need to explore

30:44.610 --> 30:46.827
because I'm trying to
figure out what's going on,

30:46.862 --> 30:48.028
and I don't know.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.197
- How about start
talking to your friends?

30:50.249 --> 30:51.081
This is a good start.
- And she is.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.216
- Well, yeah, this is--
here we go.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.083
- This a good start.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.618
No, seriously,
'cause a lot of people

30:54.653 --> 30:55.986
don't even start there.

30:56.005 --> 30:58.338
- No, I-I do need help.

30:58.374 --> 31:01.458
- The more I eat,
the bigger my breasts get.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.126
- We're about to talk
about that.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.695
[laughing]

31:04.730 --> 31:05.829
- oh, god.

31:05.848 --> 31:08.398
- But you-you're not facing
anything I haven't faced.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.067
I don't think,
if we're all honest,

31:10.102 --> 31:10.884
we all have faced.
- Right.

31:10.936 --> 31:11.852
- Yes.
- I'm facing it, right now.

31:11.887 --> 31:12.853
- I'm also right where
you are, robyn, yes.

31:12.888 --> 31:15.188
- I'm right-I'm right
where you are, robyn.

31:15.224 --> 31:17.274
- Right.
- I feel overwhelmed.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.476
That's my-that's my issue.
I have too much on my plate.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.478
- I just have one more thing
to add to that.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.362
I was talking to
robyn earlier.

31:22.398 --> 31:24.615
- Okay.
- We were just chit-chatting.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.017
You're, like,
in a whole new space

31:27.036 --> 31:29.853
and in a whole new something.
- I am, yeah.

31:29.872 --> 31:31.354
- I can't put
my finger on it.

31:31.373 --> 31:33.657
It's-- there's a difference.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.409
- Can I just add to
that a little bit?

31:35.461 --> 31:38.245
I feel like your personality
is slightly different.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.883
- I have-- I've seen
more of your body parts

31:42.918 --> 31:44.401
in the past month.
- Yes.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.803
- Than I have the entire time
I've known you.

31:48.591 --> 31:51.224
- Yeah, the difference is,
clearly, I had my boobs done.

31:51.260 --> 31:52.809
- Having nothing
to do with that.

31:52.845 --> 31:55.729
- You've been a little more
like drop it like it's hot.

31:55.764 --> 31:56.563
Booty poppin'.

31:56.599 --> 31:57.681
- So--
- you know, just I feel like

31:57.716 --> 32:00.584
the-the wendy I met last year
was not that loose.

32:07.493 --> 32:10.394
Keand in a whole new something.
A - I am, yeah.Ce

32:10.429 --> 32:11.778
- I can't put
my finger on it.

32:11.814 --> 32:13.280
There's a difference.

32:13.315 --> 32:15.666
I've seen more
of your body parts

32:15.701 --> 32:16.700
in the past month.
- Yes.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.536
- Than I have the entire time
I've known you.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.622
- The difference is,
I had my boobs done.

32:21.657 --> 32:23.707
- I feel like the wendy
I met last year

32:23.742 --> 32:25.575
was not that loose.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.046
- Wow, tweedle and twaddle,

32:29.081 --> 32:31.465
why are you
badgering wendy?

32:31.500 --> 32:33.783
Worry about
your own areolas.

32:33.802 --> 32:36.219
Like, why are you
in her business?

32:36.255 --> 32:39.473
- It's-it's totally
not the wendy that I met.

32:39.508 --> 32:42.809
- Hmm.
- It is way different

32:42.845 --> 32:44.811
from professor wendy,

32:44.847 --> 32:46.980
um, substance wendy.

32:47.016 --> 32:48.348
- We are often put
in a box

32:48.400 --> 32:51.568
that you cannot be sexy
and have substance.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.520
- Okay, okay, can I point
one thing out that--

32:53.572 --> 32:54.488
that has stood out to me?
- I don't know, I think
I disagree with that

32:54.523 --> 32:56.306
because you would never
see michelle obama

32:56.325 --> 32:57.407
with her boobies out.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.609
You will never see oprah
with her boobies out, right?

32:59.644 --> 33:01.545
Because you say don't put
ourselves in a box, but damn.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.531
Like, if you're a professor,
you have to embody that and--

33:04.583 --> 33:05.415
'cause that's who you are.
- No, you do not.

33:05.451 --> 33:08.051
That's a lie.
That's-- that's a lie.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.620
I stand before you as someone
who still has multiple degrees,

33:10.656 --> 33:12.422
who is still a professor at one
of the highest institutions,

33:12.458 --> 33:14.007
who is still a commentator,

33:14.043 --> 33:15.058
who still does all
of those things.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.543
- Right.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.345
- And that does not take away
from any of my accolades.

33:18.380 --> 33:21.164
You said, "substance wendy."

33:21.183 --> 33:23.333
that's triggering,
especially for a career woman.

33:23.352 --> 33:26.019
- Mm-hmm.
- You were sexy last year.

33:26.055 --> 33:26.853
You were sexy last year.

33:26.889 --> 33:28.555
- I-I define my sexiness,
not you.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.058
- I'm saying I can't
put my finger on

33:31.110 --> 33:32.059
what's different with you,
what robyn said,

33:32.111 --> 33:33.560
with your personality.
- Yeah.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.746
I think my personality
is me being confident

33:35.781 --> 33:38.982
in the skin I'm in both
physically and substantively.

33:39.017 --> 33:39.849
- So, you weren't
confident last year

33:39.868 --> 33:41.651
with your body?
- Right.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.621
- No woman at this table
two months postpartum

33:44.656 --> 33:47.574
is the woman she was
before she had the baby.
- Absolutely. Hello.

33:47.626 --> 33:51.078
- Do you feel like this body
has made you more confident

33:51.130 --> 33:53.163
or has changed
your personality?

33:53.198 --> 33:55.432
- It's not that
it's changed me,

33:55.467 --> 33:58.368
but it's like I can be
a professor, a commentator,

33:58.387 --> 34:00.887
and I can booty pop
and twerk.

34:00.923 --> 34:03.039
- Wendy, don't
defend your choice

34:03.058 --> 34:05.008
to do something
for yourself.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.562
We should be able to do that
among this table of girlfriends.

34:08.597 --> 34:09.896
- We do, and that's not
the issue or the question.

34:09.932 --> 34:11.431
- We should be able-- I should
be able to show my pubic hair

34:11.483 --> 34:12.649
if I wanted to because--
- okay.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.885
- You know, and y'all should
be going, "yes, karen. Yes."

34:15.904 --> 34:17.354
- I don't wanna
see pubic hair.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.441
What kinda got me here
to this conversation

34:21.493 --> 34:23.443
that I'm having with you
today is, like,

34:23.495 --> 34:25.529
you're kinda coming for
mia's neck, and it was,

34:25.564 --> 34:28.415
like, a little bit more
in your face, so to speak,

34:28.450 --> 34:30.733
than I've seen from you
in the past.

34:30.753 --> 34:32.419
- I didn't come for you
at karen's house

34:32.454 --> 34:33.420
'cause I respect people's house.
- Wen-- wendy.

34:33.455 --> 34:36.173
- But today, I have time.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.340
- Hmm.
- I am zen wen.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.310
So, do not try to come for me
because what I do have,

34:40.345 --> 34:42.679
and what I will
always have, is time.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.347
So, tick tock, mia.

34:44.383 --> 34:45.748
You are dismissed.

34:45.768 --> 34:46.650
No.
- I will say,

34:46.685 --> 34:48.468
I still don't know
why we were arguing.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.920
- Yeah, so what you saw
wasn't me just reacting

34:50.939 --> 34:51.972
to that day.
- Okay.

34:52.024 --> 34:54.274
- It was me reacting to
the cumulation of days.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.475
- I got you.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.310
I like wendy.
I want wendy to be happy.

34:57.362 --> 34:59.946
It doesn't seem
like she is.

34:59.982 --> 35:02.499
It seems like there's
something internally going on

35:02.534 --> 35:06.620
underneath it all
that she's trying to mask.

35:06.655 --> 35:08.238
- Do you have any
other questions?

35:09.825 --> 35:10.841
- Yes.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.709
- Since you've been asking
everybody questions.

35:12.744 --> 35:13.577
- Yes, yes.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.128
- There have been
a few conversations

35:15.164 --> 35:17.714
in regards to
your significant other.

35:17.749 --> 35:18.465
- Mm-hmm.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.084
- And it's just
a bit confusing.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.953
So, I just wanted
to know from you,

35:23.972 --> 35:26.789
are you in
a relationship?

35:26.809 --> 35:30.327
- I'm not gonna discuss
that in front of trolls.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.398
There's people that have
decided to lie about him

35:35.434 --> 35:37.234
and say things about him.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.468
So, when we're
together separately--
- okay.

35:38.487 --> 35:40.370
- I'll be more than happy to
answer all your questions.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.189

- No, no, hold on.

that's not fair.

desire to discuss him

35:46.645 --> 35:49.663
in front of her.
So, that's totally fair.

35:49.698 --> 35:51.865

speak of me as a lie.
