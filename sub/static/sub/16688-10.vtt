WEBVTT

00:12.600 --> 00:14.060
Ohhhhhhhh!

00:14.160 --> 00:16.300
Time to kick this up a notch.
( Gun warbles )

00:16.400 --> 00:18.100
Dude, you can't shoot
at maximum power.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.700
Your little body
can't handle it.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.280
You don't know
<i>whatmy body is capable of.</i>

00:28.720 --> 00:31.220
Eh, those new curtains really
tie the room together, eh?

00:31.320 --> 00:34.220
Yeah, eh? More maple syrup
for your pancakes, eh?

00:34.320 --> 00:35.940
Oh, I'm sorry!
So sorry!
Oh, gee!

00:36.040 --> 00:37.460
( Fire alarm ringing )

00:37.560 --> 00:40.220
The Canadians?!
Of all people!

00:40.320 --> 00:42.980
They're the most pleasant group
on the entire Space Tree.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.180
I said I was sorry.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.820
You're a loose cannon,
Rigby,

00:45.920 --> 00:47.920
and I won't tolerate
your unsafe behavior anymore!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Unsafe?! I'm totally ââ

00:50.720 --> 00:52.580
Whoâoa, whoâoâoâoa!

00:52.680 --> 00:53.620
...safe?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.220
I'm putting you
on probation.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.180
That means
no more target practice,

00:57.280 --> 00:58.900
no offâsite privileges,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.460
and, of course,
no food trucks.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.300
( Gasps ) But tomorrow is
Roxie's Famous Fry Truck!

01:04.400 --> 01:05.940
Her butt salt is delicious!

01:06.040 --> 01:08.140
Guess it's no butt salt
for <i>you.</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:09.860
Can't you let me slide
just this once?

01:09.960 --> 01:11.340
Hmm.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.440
If you pass
the Space Tree safety test,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.500
I'll let you off the hook.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.700
But I suggest
you start studying <i>now.</i>

01:16.800 --> 01:20.140
This thing's drier than a bowl
of pretzels on Dust Planet 9.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.240
Come on, Rawls.
I just graduated high school.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.420
I'm not gonna read
that thing.

01:23.520 --> 01:27.660
Well, there is another way
for those less, uh, literate.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.860
Name it.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.100
Perkins, awaken
Spacey McSpacetree.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.100
( Alarm buzzes )

01:33.200 --> 01:35.060
( Alarm beeping )

01:35.160 --> 01:37.160
( Air hisses )

01:40.760 --> 01:42.340
Hey, everybody!

01:42.440 --> 01:43.380
( Laughs )

01:43.480 --> 01:45.060
Hello, Spacey.
Been a while.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.500
Who is this guy?

01:46.600 --> 01:48.780
Rigby,
this is Spacey McSpacetree,

01:48.880 --> 01:50.660
our beloved mascot.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.740
He's been in cryoâsleep
for the last 30 years.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.200
( Scoffs )
That <i>costumesure looks like</i>
it's from 30 years ago.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.980
Coâoâstume?

01:57.080 --> 01:58.500
Hey!
Show him some respect!

01:58.600 --> 02:00.520
He's gonna stick with you
until you pass the test.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.220
That's right.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.700
You can't be Safey McSafety
without Spacey McSpacetree.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.460
It's certainly nice to wake up
to a new friend.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.140
Put 'er there, Rigby.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.820
Whoa! Careful, now.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.020
That's a very unsafe handshake
you got there.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.120
We're gonna have to
work on that.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.360
( Groans )

02:18.880 --> 02:23.980
So, in conclusion, the seat belt
always go <i>overthe waist.</i>

02:24.080 --> 02:26.080
Do you need
another demonstration?

02:25.680 --> 02:26.820
Ugh! I got it!

02:26.920 --> 02:29.120
You already showed me,
like, five times.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.620
( Gasps )

02:31.720 --> 02:33.220
Pump the brakes there,
amigo!

02:33.320 --> 02:35.300
That's a safety violation
waiting to happen.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.400
I was just putting it down.
I wasn't gonna spill it.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.100
( Sighs )
Okay, picture this.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.500
Say you're walking around,
minding your own business,

02:42.600 --> 02:44.760
Then bam!
You knock into the table.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.900
Aw, come on!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.260
Then, next thing you know ââ
Whoop!

02:49.360 --> 02:50.780
...you end up
hurting yourself.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.220
Or worse.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.460
Whoa! ( Grunts )

02:53.560 --> 02:55.180
You end up
in the hospital.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.940
Ugh! You did that
on purpose.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.040
That would never happen
in real life.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.980
Hey, what's the commotion
in here?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.140
Whoa! Aaah!

03:01.240 --> 03:02.100
( Grunts )

03:02.200 --> 03:03.860
Oh, Benson!

03:03.960 --> 03:06.460
WâWâWâWhoa!

03:06.560 --> 03:08.060
( Whimpering )
Bad show!

03:08.160 --> 03:10.160
See?

03:10.720 --> 03:13.140
Come on, bro!
Dig deep!

03:13.240 --> 03:14.220
( Grunts )

03:14.320 --> 03:15.300
Huh? What?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.140
( Chuckling )

03:17.240 --> 03:19.980
Zero G!

03:20.080 --> 03:22.100
( Laughter )

03:22.200 --> 03:25.020
Aw. <i>Iwant to pretend</i>
like I can lift heavy stuff.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.300
Stupid probation.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.260
They're not even wearing helmets
in there!

03:28.360 --> 03:30.660
Uno momento, Rigâbud.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.980
( Laughter )
( Door opens )

03:33.080 --> 03:34.260
Hey, guys.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.820
Having a good time?

03:35.920 --> 03:36.780
Whoops!

03:36.880 --> 03:38.060
( Crash )

03:38.160 --> 03:40.160
Still look fun to you?!

03:41.800 --> 03:43.980
Dude, what's wrong
with your new friend?

03:44.080 --> 03:45.100
He's not my friend!

03:45.200 --> 03:47.200
He's just teaching me
about safety

03:46.280 --> 03:48.280
so I can
get off probation.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.220
Why didn't you just read
the safety manual?

03:50.320 --> 03:52.860
Yeah, bro.
It's a pretty informative read.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.960
Well, I wish I knew that
before I got stuck

03:54.800 --> 03:56.800
with this crazy tree guy
following me around

03:56.640 --> 03:58.640
and judging
my every move!

03:57.840 --> 04:00.180
Rigby!
That's a safety violation!

04:00.280 --> 04:03.420
Don't you know that 7 out of 10
lunchtime injuries

04:03.520 --> 04:06.060
are directly related
to trayâslamming?

04:06.160 --> 04:08.300
This could've been you!

04:08.400 --> 04:09.780
( All gasp )

04:09.880 --> 04:12.300
Whoa, eh!
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.180
Spacey!
What's your problem?!

04:14.280 --> 04:16.460
Hey, I'm just
watching your back, buddy.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.680
I still got to teach you
about safety with <i>music.</i>

04:22.360 --> 04:24.720
( Midâtempo synth pop playing )

05:10.560 --> 05:13.740
Safeââ Safey McSafety.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.840
( Snores )
Dude, turn! Turn!

05:17.040 --> 05:18.460
Aah! Got to be safe!

05:18.560 --> 05:20.020
If I'm not safe,
he'll show up.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.980
Dude, are you all right?
You look horrible.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.860
It's Spacey!

05:23.960 --> 05:25.940
I got to get him off my back
once and for all!

05:26.040 --> 05:27.540
Yeah, you got to
pass that test.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.640
I can't take
much more of that guy.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.500
Don't worry. I have a plan.
( Chuckles )

05:31.600 --> 05:32.660
Take the wheel!

05:32.760 --> 05:34.700
Hey!
Where are you going?!

05:34.800 --> 05:36.800
Aren't you on probaââ
( Gasps )

05:37.800 --> 05:40.060
So, Spacey says
you're ready for this?

05:40.160 --> 05:42.140
Look ââ I even have
written permission.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.300
Hmm.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.020
Looks like
30 years of cryoâsleep

05:45.120 --> 05:47.120
did a number
on his penmanship.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.820
But if Spacey says you're ready,
you're ready.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.820
This is
our testing overlook machine,

05:50.920 --> 05:52.700
or, as we like to call it,
T.O.M.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.260
It's proficient in all forms
of safety protocol.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.180
Hello, T.O.M.
This is Rigby.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.220
<i>Hello, Rigby. I look forward</i>
<i>to grading your test.</i>

06:00.320 --> 06:01.700
Whoa. This is a test?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.800
Does it come with a crazy pencil
or something?

06:03.640 --> 06:05.300
No, there's no pencil.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.400
Just call out your answer, and
it will fill in automatically.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.780
Once it's complete,
insert it into T.O.M.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.880
Good luck.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.100
Ugh! How long
does he want me to do this?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.200
( Siren wailing )
Huh?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.460
Rigby,
old buddy, old pal.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.820
Couldn't help but notice

06:22.920 --> 06:26.060
you were driving
a little erratically back there.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.140
That's not very...

06:27.240 --> 06:28.860
safe?!

06:28.960 --> 06:29.980
Uhhhhh...

06:30.080 --> 06:30.980
Whoa!

06:31.080 --> 06:33.660
Where is he?!
Where's Rigby?!

06:33.760 --> 06:35.900
Dude, I don't know!
I don't know!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Rigby!
( Siren wailing )

06:39.520 --> 06:41.940
Okay, question 17 ââ "B."

06:42.040 --> 06:43.380
( Beep )

06:43.480 --> 06:44.780
All right. Question 18.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.560
( Siren wailing )
I'm coming, buddy!

06:49.240 --> 06:50.420
Whoa!

06:50.520 --> 06:53.220
Look both ways!
You're not being safe!

06:53.320 --> 06:55.180
I'm sorry!

06:55.280 --> 06:56.380
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.060
Man, this is easier
than I thought.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.300
"C"!
( Beep )

06:59.400 --> 07:01.740
Goodbye, Spacey,
and goodbye, probation.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.860
( Thud )
Rigby!

07:03.960 --> 07:06.340
You're not ready!

07:06.440 --> 07:08.860
( Door opens )
Uhâoh. A, B, D,
A, B, B, B!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.380
( Panting )

07:10.480 --> 07:12.480
( Panting )

07:17.400 --> 07:20.180
( Both grunting )

07:20.280 --> 07:21.740
Let go!
No!

07:21.840 --> 07:23.660
You still have
so much to learn!

07:23.760 --> 07:25.780
No!
I'm through with you!

07:25.880 --> 07:27.460
( Grunts )

07:27.560 --> 07:29.740
( Grunting )

07:29.840 --> 07:30.740
No!

07:30.840 --> 07:32.840
( Both groan )

07:33.600 --> 07:34.540
Yes!

07:34.640 --> 07:36.420
<i>Error. Test malfunction.</i>

07:36.520 --> 07:37.540
( Warbling )

07:37.640 --> 07:38.900
( Both gasp )

07:39.000 --> 07:41.420
( Whirring )

07:41.520 --> 07:43.300
Now look
what you've done!

07:43.400 --> 07:44.620
Me?! It was <i>you!</i>

07:44.720 --> 07:46.260
You're ruining my life!

07:46.360 --> 07:47.220
( Both gasp )

07:47.320 --> 07:48.700
Ruining your life?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.460
I thought we were bros.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.380
You're the first friend
I've had in 30 years.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.640
Don't make like a tree
and leave me.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.460
( Gasps ) Spacey!

07:58.560 --> 08:00.900
Aah! What do I do?!
What do I do?!

08:01.000 --> 08:02.580
Quick!
Stop, drop, and roll!

08:02.680 --> 08:04.020
( Screaming )

08:04.120 --> 08:05.260
( Whirring, ding )

08:05.360 --> 08:07.140
I got to finish
the test!

08:07.240 --> 08:09.060
Come on!
We can still fix this!

08:09.160 --> 08:11.820
WâWhat?!
Us against that?!

08:11.920 --> 08:13.900
That's totally unsafe!

08:14.000 --> 08:16.600
Hey, sometimes you got to be
unsafe to be safe.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.140
( Screams )

08:19.240 --> 08:21.320
Quick! Grab the test
and read me the questions!

08:22.760 --> 08:25.300
Which ones
did you leave blank?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.460
Uh...

08:26.560 --> 08:29.420
27, 44, and 83!

08:29.520 --> 08:31.520
( Grunts )

08:32.320 --> 08:34.260
Okay, question 27.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.760
"What do you do
during a spaceâquake?"

08:37.880 --> 08:39.260
( Grunts )

08:39.360 --> 08:40.460
I know this.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.820
Oh! Take cover
underneath a table!

08:42.920 --> 08:44.920
Aah!
( Ding )

08:46.160 --> 08:47.180
Nice one!

08:47.280 --> 08:49.100
Okay, question 44.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.780
"Where are you permitted to use
Space Tree laser guns?"

08:52.880 --> 08:54.700
Only in designated
shooting areas.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.720
( T.O.M. whirs )
( Gasps ) Or if we're
under attack, of course.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.100
Whaaa!

08:58.200 --> 09:00.200
( Ding )

09:01.800 --> 09:02.660
( Grunts )

09:02.760 --> 09:04.860
Okay, last question.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.840
"What should you never do
with space soda?"

09:10.160 --> 09:12.260
What are my options?!

09:12.360 --> 09:15.260
"A" ââ drink while operating
heavy machinery.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.340
"B" ââ put it on the edge
of a table.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.020
"C" ââ drink more
than two bottles a day.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.660
( Screams )

09:22.760 --> 09:25.420
Come on, Rigby!
We went over this!

09:25.520 --> 09:26.420
Whoa!

09:26.520 --> 09:28.460
( Screams )

09:28.560 --> 09:29.420
( Grunts )

09:29.520 --> 09:31.300
"D." ( Coughs )

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
( Ding )
All of the above.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.320
( Screams )

09:38.040 --> 09:39.980
( Clank )
<i>Safety test complete.</i>

09:40.080 --> 09:41.740
<i>Processing results.</i>

09:41.840 --> 09:43.840
<i>Congratulations. You pass.</i>

09:45.120 --> 09:46.780
( Indistinct conversations )

09:46.880 --> 09:49.660
Hey, thanks, guys.
Yeah, it worked out.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.220
Thanks for helping me,
Spacey.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.460
No problem.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.540
Sorry for being so clingy.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.100
If I've learned anything,

09:56.200 --> 10:00.260
it's that being too attached
is emotionally unsafe.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.360
Here.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.580
You keep that <i>safe</i>
for me.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.860
You got it, friend.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.960
Care for more of Roxie's
foodâtruck fries, Rigby?

10:09.880 --> 10:12.420
Or, should I say,
Safey McSafety.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.500
( Chuckles )

10:13.600 --> 10:14.940
( Gasps )
Safety violation!

10:15.040 --> 10:17.460
Come on, bro.
I'm not gonna spill it.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.660
Oops.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.220
Tea time.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.320
( Both scream )

10:29.960 --> 10:31.740
( Fire alarm ringing )

10:31.840 --> 10:33.060
I'm going back
to cryoâsleep.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.480
( Both laugh )
