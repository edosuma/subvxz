Are you sure you want
<i>this</i> guitar, sir?

00:11.810 --> 00:13.780
It's just that we don't
sell many of these

00:13.810 --> 00:16.550
To people your age.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.760
'cause you have to at least
be 21 and clearly you're not.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.890
Can I see your I.D., please?

Will you be my grandpa?

00:38.910 --> 00:41.840
Guess who got a job at
the greeting card store!

00:43.580 --> 00:44.650
Here, give this to me.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.950
Okay.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.990
"Congratulations
on your new job!"

00:49.020 --> 00:50.990
Aw, thanks. You shouldn't have.

00:52.860 --> 00:55.800
It was nothing.

00:57.870 --> 01:00.006
You're not gonna believe this!
Dez, give 'em the news.

01:00.030 --> 01:03.570
Sure. The mayor gave a speech today.
There's a 10% chance of rain,

01:03.610 --> 01:05.710
- And in sports, the dolphins...
<i>Not that news.</i>

01:05.740 --> 01:08.740
I'm doing my first
radio interview.

01:08.780 --> 01:11.910
Miami mack from fm 109
is broadcasting live

01:11.950 --> 01:14.750
-From the beach.
-That's great, austin!

01:14.780 --> 01:16.550
Oh. Here.

01:16.590 --> 01:19.690
"Congratulations on your
first radio interview

01:19.720 --> 01:21.790
Live from the beach"?

01:22.890 --> 01:24.860
I didn't know they
made cards for that.

01:24.890 --> 01:27.660
They make cards for everything.

01:28.930 --> 01:30.930
Austin, this is huge.

01:30.970 --> 01:34.010
Miami mack is the most
popular deejay in florida.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.870
I'm surprised you
know who he is.

01:35.910 --> 01:38.010
I thought you only listened
to dorky books on tape.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.780
What?!

01:42.050 --> 01:44.820
All the cool kids
listen to miami mack

01:44.850 --> 01:47.750
In the morning.

01:47.790 --> 01:49.820
He's on in the afternoon.

01:50.990 --> 01:53.860
Uh, morning is
what the cool kids

01:53.890 --> 01:56.700
Call the afternoon.

01:58.670 --> 02:01.870
This whole interview thing
must be so hard for you, ally.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.670
What do you mean?

02:03.700 --> 02:06.570
I mean, you not getting asked
to be on the radio with austin.

02:06.610 --> 02:09.780
Everyone gets to see how talented he
is, but it's like you're invisible.

02:09.810 --> 02:11.750
Well, I wouldn't
put it like that.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.950
But not invisible in a cool
way, like a superhero.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.690
More like in an uncool way,

02:15.720 --> 02:18.750
Like a songwriter who doesn't
get asked to be on the radio.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.860
Now stop it before you
hurt her feelings.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.540
Ally's not invisible. She just
doesn't like the spotlight.

02:31.570 --> 02:35.010
- Yeah, because I have stage fright.
- See, guys?

02:35.040 --> 02:38.940
Although, it would be nice
to get some recognition.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.020
I mean, in a perfect world,
I could get up on stage

02:41.050 --> 02:43.720
And sing and dance
as cool as austin.

02:50.820 --> 02:53.890
In a perfect world, you'd
never do that again.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.830
<i>When the crowd wants more</i>

03:00.870 --> 03:03.940
<i>I bring on the thunder
'cause you've got my back</i>

03:03.970 --> 03:06.840
<i>And I'm not going under, you're
my point you're my guard</i>

03:06.870 --> 03:08.610
<i>You're the perfect chord</i>

03:08.640 --> 03:11.650
<i>And I see our names
together on every billboard</i>

03:11.680 --> 03:14.720
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock</i>

03:14.750 --> 03:15.980
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:16.020 --> 03:18.650
<i>And we'll keep rockin'</i>

03:18.690 --> 03:20.690
<i>Oh, there's no way</i>

03:20.720 --> 03:22.790
<i>I could make it without ya</i>

03:22.830 --> 03:25.830
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya</i>

03:25.860 --> 03:28.900
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo</i>

03:28.930 --> 03:31.900
<i>With you it's like,
"whoa," yeah, and I know</i>

03:31.930 --> 03:34.900
<i>I own this dream</i>

03:34.940 --> 03:37.910
<i>'Cause I got you with me</i>

03:37.940 --> 03:41.010
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya</i>

03:41.040 --> 03:44.679
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:44.680 --> 03:46.949
Austin & Ally S01E09

03:46.950 --> 03:49.750
<i>I'm the sun in your eyes</i>

03:49.790 --> 03:52.560
<i>Yeah, you don't see me</i>

03:52.590 --> 03:55.790
I wear no disguise,
but you don't see me

03:55.830 --> 03:58.590
I'm a total surprise

03:58.630 --> 04:00.600
and you don't see me

04:00.630 --> 04:02.630
I'm so agonized

04:02.670 --> 04:05.600
that you don't see me...

04:07.870 --> 04:10.910
you don't see me.

04:19.779 --> 04:22.690
Austin, how long have you
been standing there?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.690
-Not that long.
-You didn't see me

04:24.720 --> 04:26.860
Do my vocal warm-ups, did you?

04:34.600 --> 04:37.740
No, didn't see anything

04:41.810 --> 04:44.980
I just came by to get a copy of A
Billion Hits to play for miami mack."

04:45.010 --> 04:46.710
There's some on the table.

04:49.050 --> 04:51.750
Hey, that song sounded great,

04:51.780 --> 04:53.850
But the lyrics are
a little girly.

04:53.890 --> 04:56.890
Well, that's great, because
the lyrics are for me,

04:56.920 --> 04:59.060
And I'm a girly.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.930
I write songs for
myself sometimes,

05:02.960 --> 05:06.900
But I'm never gonna perform them,
so I just record them for fun.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.876
You don't care about all
that stuff dez said, do you?

05:08.900 --> 05:12.510
About being invisible and
not getting recognition?

05:12.540 --> 05:15.710
Does this look like
somebody who cares?

05:22.620 --> 05:25.620
Good. 'cause I could never
do what I do without you.

05:25.650 --> 05:27.520
You're awesome.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.790
Thanks, austin.

05:33.730 --> 05:36.530
Dez, are you spying on us?

05:36.560 --> 05:37.960
What? No, I said "aw-ww"

05:38.000 --> 05:40.900
'cause I saw the cutest kid destroy
the nicest violin down there.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.640
What?!

05:47.710 --> 05:49.580
Ally just wrote the
best song for herself.

05:49.610 --> 05:50.910
It's really good.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.880
Too bad no one's
ever gonna hear it.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.920
Maybe they will.

05:55.950 --> 05:59.890
I think I know a way for people to
finally hear how talented ally is.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.830
I know, I'm a nice guy.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.660
Hmm? Oh, no, I just never
noticed this poster

06:07.700 --> 06:09.730
Of the bunny and
the puppy before.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.910
Welcome to fm 109!

06:21.940 --> 06:25.550
I'm miami mack, and we are
live from sunny south beach

06:25.580 --> 06:27.820
With austin moon.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.990
All right, now it is time

06:32.020 --> 06:34.960
For our "number one
fan challenge."

06:36.760 --> 06:39.730
The winner gets to hang out
with austin moon for a day.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.600
-Who wants to play?
- Pick me! Pick me!

06:42.630 --> 06:45.930
- Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!
- You, in the clown shorts.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.910
Okay, I'm gonna flip a coin
for your fan challenge.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.980
Heads, you get a nice
easy scavenger hunt.

06:55.010 --> 06:56.680
Tails,

06:56.710 --> 06:59.750
You have to wrestle with
a hungry alligator.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.720
Please be alligator.
Please be alligator.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.850
Please be alligator!

07:06.860 --> 07:10.590
-Heads! Scavenger hunt.
-Yes! Whoo!

07:10.630 --> 07:12.760
Okay, you are going on a
musical scavenger hunt.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.500
You have five minutes to bring
back every item on this list.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.670
I'm on it. Out of my way!
I'm a scavenger!

07:18.700 --> 07:21.800
-Out of the way! -Now the moment

07:21.840 --> 07:24.640
We have all been waiting for...

07:24.670 --> 07:26.810
Austin moon's new single!

07:34.820 --> 07:38.020
<i>I'm the girl in the
corner of the room</i>

07:39.890 --> 07:43.760
<i>the one you never noticed</i>

07:43.790 --> 07:47.530
<i>getting lost among
the stars in the sky</i>

07:47.560 --> 07:48.800
<i>like a picture...</i>

07:48.830 --> 07:51.700
Uh, austin, that doesn't
sound like you.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.870
You're right. That's not me.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.640
I must've brought the wrong cd.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.810
Oh, my gosh, I'm on the radio!
I'm on the radio!

07:58.840 --> 08:02.780
I'm on the radio...
I'm on the radio.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.680
<i>You don't see me.</i>

08:09.950 --> 08:13.790
I don't know who that was,
but, man, that song was great!

08:13.820 --> 08:15.690
That was my partner ally dawson,

08:15.720 --> 08:17.660
The most talented
singer/songwriter I know.

08:17.690 --> 08:20.860
- Well, I would really like to
give her some props -great idea.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.700
-Live and in person. -Bad idea.

08:23.730 --> 08:26.870
How about you and ally come back and
perform together live this Friday?

08:26.900 --> 08:29.840
Live? I don't think...

08:29.870 --> 08:33.610
If you wanna hear austin and ally
perform live, scream "yeah!"

08:33.640 --> 08:35.809
Yeah!

08:35.840 --> 08:37.780
No-ah!

08:37.809 --> 08:40.820
Great! Then tune in this
Friday to hear austin moon

08:40.850 --> 08:43.820
And ally dawson perform live.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.760
Excuse me. Coming through.
Coming through!

08:48.790 --> 08:51.660
Whew! Okay, I got
everything on the list.

08:51.690 --> 08:54.900
An accordion, a
tambourine and a cowboy.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.970
Oh, that list said "cowbell."

08:59.000 --> 09:01.770
Man, I must have read it wrong.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.800
I really wanted to
hang out with austin.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.740
Well, at least I still
have you, cowboy.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.810
Aw, come on, clint.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.550
What am I gonna do, trish?

09:14.580 --> 09:16.650
I always freak out when
I have to perform.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.650
What if I can get miami mack to
let you wrestle the alligator?

09:20.690 --> 09:23.560
How does that help?

09:23.590 --> 09:27.590
It doesn't, but I really wanna see
somebody wrestle an alligator.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.430
I don't know what to do, trish.

09:36.460 --> 09:39.600
I can't back out of performing
on miami mack's radio show.

09:39.630 --> 09:41.700
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

09:41.740 --> 09:44.610
I could have a meltdown and
totally embarrass myself.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.640
I said "worst thing." you
could throw up on the deejay.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.650
You could ruin your career. You
could ruin austin's career.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.810
You could sprain your ankle
running off the stage.

09:52.850 --> 09:56.580
Thanks, trish. I
feel much better.

09:56.620 --> 09:59.550
Ally, I'm so sorry
you have to perform.

09:59.590 --> 10:02.660
Please, it's not your fault.
You brought the wrong cd.

10:02.690 --> 10:04.390
It was an accident.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.860
Yeah... it was an accident.

10:06.900 --> 10:10.830
I didn't purposely bring the wrong
cd so you would get recognition.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.800
Why would I do that?

10:13.840 --> 10:16.670
I'm not accusing
you of doing that.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.580
-Okay, I did it. -What?!

10:18.610 --> 10:20.780
Trish, help me out.

10:20.810 --> 10:24.680
What, you think they make an "I'm sorry
for playing your song on the radio,

10:24.720 --> 10:28.590
I didn't know it would backfire" card?
Actually, they do.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.490
I can't believe it,
that you would do that,

10:35.530 --> 10:38.430
And that they would
make a card for it.

10:38.460 --> 10:39.830
I know, right?

10:39.870 --> 10:43.740
I just want people to know
how talented you are.

10:43.770 --> 10:46.910
I appreciate what you were
trying to do, but now what?

10:46.940 --> 10:49.670
I can't perform with
my stage fright.

10:49.710 --> 10:52.780
Don't worry. I just found a cure
for stage fright on the internet.

10:52.810 --> 10:56.520
Close your eyes and imagine
you're in a peaceful meadow.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.820
The sun is shining. The
birds are singing.

10:59.850 --> 11:02.620
Everything is calm.

11:06.490 --> 11:09.800
Austin! That's the
cure for hiccups.

11:09.830 --> 11:13.430
Oh, you're right. Sorry.

11:13.470 --> 11:16.870
But you don't have the
hiccups now, do you?

11:22.680 --> 11:24.710
Okay, so what's your big plan?

11:24.740 --> 11:27.580
I know a guy who can get
you over your stage fright

11:27.610 --> 11:28.780
So you can perform on Friday.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.420
A man with incredible powers.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.790
The amazing dez-mo!

11:35.790 --> 11:38.690
It is I, dez-mo,
master of mystery.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.730
I solved the mystery. It's
a dork in a stupid hat.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.500
I'll have you know I'm
a skilled hypnotist.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.870
I've had extensive training
in the mystical arts.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.840
He spent a week at a hypnotism
camp in the mall parking lot.

11:51.870 --> 11:55.810
- I thought we were in hawaii. -You
were hypnotized to think that.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.840
It's a really good camp.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.850
This isn't gonna work.

11:59.880 --> 12:03.550
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
Hypnotism is really simple.

12:03.580 --> 12:06.466
I'll put just you in a trance and give you
a trigger word to control your behavior.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.450
I already tested
it out on austin.

12:08.490 --> 12:10.460
-No, you didn't. -Kitty cat.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.530
- Kitty cat. -So did you guys
finish hypnotizing ally?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.670
Okay, dez, I'll give it a shot.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.670
Stare into the swirly lines.

12:27.710 --> 12:30.640
Focus on the swirly lines.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.780
You are getting
sleepy, very sleepy.

12:33.810 --> 12:36.650
You can hardly stay awake.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.490
You're falling into
a deep, deep sleep.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.520
The amazing dez-mo, everybody.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.900
I really wanted this to work.

12:50.930 --> 12:53.830
I want the world to know
who ally dawson is.

12:53.870 --> 12:56.800
What's the big deal?
No one knows me now.

12:57.870 --> 13:00.810
Yeah, nobody knows you.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.810
Nobody knows you.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.810
Okay, I get it. You don't
have to rub it in.

13:07.410 --> 13:09.720
No, people don't
know who you are,

13:09.750 --> 13:11.650
So no one knows
what you look like.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.620
We can have trish pretend to be
you during the radio interview.

13:14.650 --> 13:16.560
What about the singing?

13:16.590 --> 13:19.660
You'll hide off-stage and sing
into a mic while trish lip-syncs.

13:19.690 --> 13:21.660
I don't know. It seems
like a lot to pull off.

13:21.690 --> 13:23.776
What if something goes wrong?
And do you really think trish

13:23.800 --> 13:26.700
Will be able to lip-sync
everything I...

13:28.440 --> 13:30.700
Okay, this'll work.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.870
You guys go get ready.
I'll wake dez.

13:36.910 --> 13:40.410
This is the great trish-ini.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.550
When you hear the word "song,"

13:42.580 --> 13:43.896
You'll think there's a
mouse in your pants.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.850
Awaken!

13:47.520 --> 13:49.490
What happened?

13:49.520 --> 13:52.560
Well, we figured out what
to do about ally's song.

13:53.860 --> 13:56.830
Mouse in my pants.
Mouse in my pants!

14:08.510 --> 14:10.740
Okay, you'll talk into this mic

14:10.780 --> 14:12.610
To give trish the answers
for the interview.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.610
Then when you sing,
I'll flip this switch

14:14.650 --> 14:18.380
And your voice will go over the fm
109 speakers while trish lip-syncs.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.650
Wow, you're really
good with electronics.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.420
What can I say?
It's in my <i>genes.</i>

14:23.460 --> 14:25.660
Oh, so your parents are
good with electronics, too?

14:25.690 --> 14:27.830
What? Oh, no, I keep
this instruction manual

14:27.860 --> 14:31.530
-In my <i>jeans. -You're
not wearing jeans.</i>

14:31.560 --> 14:35.600
Right, 'cause you're
the jeans expert.

14:35.630 --> 14:37.816
Okay, I just need to find an open
channel for the wireless mic.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.540
<i>The high is 80 degrees...</i>

14:39.570 --> 14:41.510
<i>there, you're all set.</i>

14:41.540 --> 14:43.686
Now when you talk, trish will
hear you in her earpiece.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.610
-I hope it works. -We all do.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.680
<i>Welcome back to fm 109.</i>

14:49.710 --> 14:53.520
We're here live with austin moon
and his partner ally dawson.

14:53.550 --> 14:57.520
Now tell me, ally, how long
have you been writing music?

14:57.560 --> 14:59.690
Ever since I was
in kindergarten.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.790
You know, I've always
had a love for music.

15:01.830 --> 15:04.536
<i>I really don't think there's a better
way to express what you're feeling.</i>

15:04.560 --> 15:06.470
<i>When you look inside
your heart and...</i>

15:06.500 --> 15:09.700
Since kindergarten.
Next question.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.610
Wow, ally's a girl who gets
straight to the point.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.510
I wish.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.610
Can you describe to me in detail

15:16.640 --> 15:19.450
Exactly what goes through your
mind when you're writing a song?

15:19.480 --> 15:21.850
Writing a song?

15:21.880 --> 15:25.420
Mouse in my pants!

15:27.720 --> 15:29.420
Dez, you cut the connection!

15:30.760 --> 15:32.760
Are you gonna answer or what?

15:34.460 --> 15:35.800
Well, I...

15:35.830 --> 15:38.400
Trish!

15:38.430 --> 15:41.500
Is ally's best friend.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.570
Just thought you should know.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.670
- What are you doing? -I
can't hear ally anymore.

15:55.790 --> 15:58.890
If I can't hear Ally how am I
supposed to answer the questions?

15:58.920 --> 16:01.690
She's your best friend. You
know everything about her.

16:01.730 --> 16:04.860
You're right. You're right.
I can do this.

16:04.900 --> 16:08.530
Okay, let's just start
from the beginning, ally.

16:08.570 --> 16:09.900
When did you start
playing music?

16:09.940 --> 16:11.940
When I was four.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.710
No, wait. Four is when
ally started ballet.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.840
She started playing music
when she was five.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.986
Why are you talking about
yourself in the third person?

16:19.010 --> 16:21.580
Ally always does that.

16:21.610 --> 16:22.880
It annoys austin.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.720
Ally should think more
before ally answers.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.020
All right, let's take a question

16:32.060 --> 16:34.860
From the fm 109 live chat.

16:34.890 --> 16:38.000
"ally, who taught you
how to play piano?"

16:38.030 --> 16:41.800
I know this one. Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.

16:41.830 --> 16:45.570
Wasn't it your dad?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.800
Yes, right. Mr. Dawson.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.640
I mean, my dad.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.610
Who is mr. Dawson.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.610
I call him dad.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.580
Because he's my dad.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.710
Why wouldn't I call him dad?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.850
Okay, let me start over.

16:59.880 --> 17:03.620
Get a hold of yourself. It's
almost time to sing the song.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.619
What happened?

17:08.660 --> 17:09.960
You broke the transmitter.

17:09.990 --> 17:12.690
You've been jumping
around like a crazy man

17:12.730 --> 17:15.599
Screaming about a
mouse in your pants.

17:15.630 --> 17:19.540
You're nuts. I stopped keeping
rodents in my pants years ago.

17:21.010 --> 17:23.940
Okay, my dad is my dad, right?

17:23.980 --> 17:25.940
And I'm ally dawson.

17:25.980 --> 17:29.550
So that would make mr.
Dawson my dad,

17:29.580 --> 17:31.750
And taught me how to play piano.

17:31.780 --> 17:34.720
Nailed it!

17:37.060 --> 17:39.760
Okay, enough questions.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.150
I just wanna hear
you two perform.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.960
- Dez, hurry. They're about to start.
- Fixed it!

17:46.000 --> 17:48.900
-You're all set.
-Perfect, just in time.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.870
Ally's ready to sing.

17:53.910 --> 17:56.840
Great! Because we're
waiting for you to sing.

17:56.870 --> 17:58.740
Let's just do the song.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.040
<i>Song...</i>

18:02.750 --> 18:04.880
Not again!

18:09.950 --> 18:11.650
I'm the girl

18:11.690 --> 18:14.690
in the corner of the room

18:14.720 --> 18:17.960
<i>the one you never noticed</i>

18:19.730 --> 18:23.570
<i>getting lost among
the stars in the sky</i>

18:23.600 --> 18:26.600
<i>like a picture out of focus</i>

18:26.640 --> 18:29.000
I'm the sun in your eyes

18:29.040 --> 18:31.570
yeah, you don't see me

18:31.610 --> 18:33.640
I wear no disguise

18:33.680 --> 18:35.710
<i>but you don't see me</i>

18:35.740 --> 18:38.550
<i>I'm a total surprise</i>

18:38.580 --> 18:40.610
and you don't see me...?

18:40.650 --> 18:43.620
<i>Dez, I lost the channel!</i>

18:53.760 --> 18:57.630
<i>A huge pile-up on I-95 has
caused two lanes to close.</i>

18:57.660 --> 19:00.600
<i>Expect slow traffic all the way
from north miami to key biscayne.</i>

19:00.630 --> 19:03.700
<i>Also, exits 3d through 7e
are closed temporarily</i>

19:03.730 --> 19:07.600
<i>Until the department of fowl collection
can safely return all 493 chickens...</i>

19:29.920 --> 19:32.590
<i>Mouse in my pants.
Mouse in my pants!</i>

19:46.970 --> 19:48.840
Thank you, miami!

19:57.680 --> 20:00.720
I know the interview
didn't go so well,

20:00.750 --> 20:04.550
But thanks for trying to
share the spotlight with me.

20:04.590 --> 20:06.550
Listen, it doesn't matter

20:06.590 --> 20:08.690
If the world doesn't know
how talented you are.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.590
I always will.

20:12.990 --> 20:16.630
Thanks, austin.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.970
I know, he's a nice guy.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.600
What? No, I was just
checking my tonsils.

20:29.070 --> 20:31.910
Guess who's on the cover
of "miami music."

20:31.940 --> 20:34.880
Austin and ally!

20:34.910 --> 20:36.780
I can't believe it.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.790
I know. Me and austin are
on the cover of a magazine.

20:39.820 --> 20:42.020
Wow, they must've really
liked your interview.

20:42.060 --> 20:45.690
I think "ally" did a pretty good
job, if I may say so myself.

20:47.730 --> 20:50.700
Yeah, ally doesn't think so.

20:50.730 --> 20:54.070
Well, "ally" is just glad
this all worked out.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.840
I'm sorry. I don't know
how this game works.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.040
"ally" will be over there.

21:02.940 --> 21:06.550
Ah, there you are.
I just want to say

21:06.580 --> 21:07.850
That the way you merged genres

21:07.880 --> 21:10.850
And changed your voice
on my show was amazing.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.590
Ally dawson, you
are a true talent.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.650
Thanks!

21:21.660 --> 21:23.600
Hey, trish,

21:23.630 --> 21:26.570
Your boss from the card store
just dropped this off.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.600
"I hate to come off
like a mean old jerk,

21:29.640 --> 21:31.770
But it's been three days
since you came to work.

21:31.810 --> 21:33.670
I hope this is news
that you desired,

21:33.710 --> 21:36.880
Because I'm happy to
say you're so fired"?!

21:36.910 --> 21:39.850
That is so specific.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.980
How many of these cards
can they possibly sell?

21:43.020 --> 21:45.850
Actually, someone's given me. Ne
