WEBVTT

00:08.141 --> 00:09.586
Yo, Marcus, it's Dirty.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.748
How 'bout you open the door,
I'll fuck you up,

00:11.778 --> 00:12.779
and then I'll fuck off?

00:13.813 --> 00:16.726
2K Marcus owes you plus ten.
That's five for you, Dirty.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.991
Hey, the truck
will be delivered tomorrow.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.327
Just bought Coach Healey a truck.

00:20.353 --> 00:25.302
Cam, some in the media are calling you
a "P" word that rhymes with wussy.

00:25.325 --> 00:28.568
- How do you respond?
- I'm a good person who has value.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.905
You mind if I get rid of
this lawn decoration

00:30.930 --> 00:32.637
that the previous owners
left behind?

00:32.665 --> 00:34.167
Uh-uh, that might be
worth some money.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.339
- Oh--
- Oh!

00:36.369 --> 00:37.609
You gotta do two things.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.481
One-- drastically limit
what annoys you.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.977
And two-- stop saying things like
"I'm a grown-ass man."

00:44.010 --> 00:46.115
All it does is tell people you're not.

00:46.146 --> 00:49.593
(music playing)

00:50.884 --> 00:52.454
(buzzer sounds)

00:52.485 --> 00:54.965
Welcome back to
"Dennis and Callahan."

00:54.988 --> 00:58.401
We are thrilled to have a special guest
live in the studio today.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.497
He's an old friend,
he's Boston-born, he's Boston-bred.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.132
Cam Calloway back in the Hub

01:03.163 --> 01:05.233
for his first big game
against the old town team.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.869
John, Gerry, get to be in Boston.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.811
Cam Calloway--
good kid, local kid.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.076
The pride of Saint McGuire's
in Dorchester.

01:11.104 --> 01:14.176
- You must hate Atlanta.
- I love Atlanta, Gerry.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.244
Sure, when they signed you
to that contract.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.018
But the team's 4-11,
you got beat up by your sister,

01:19.045 --> 01:21.423
- and then you lied about it.
- Jeez, Gerry, I would've lied, too.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.428
- She can fucking punch.
- You can bleep that, right?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.760
And then he made these
appalling PSAs

01:25.785 --> 01:28.095
where a lot of people thought
he was mocking domestic violence.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.123
Is there any evidence
that domestic abusers

01:30.156 --> 01:32.193
watch a TV commercial and say,

01:32.225 --> 01:34.933
"You know, I was gonna coldcock
my loved one in the face,

01:34.961 --> 01:38.033
but then I saw Cam Calloway cry,
so maybe I won't."

01:38.064 --> 01:39.873
Each conversation yields education.

01:39.899 --> 01:42.140
How do you not throw your back out
slanging that BS?

01:42.168 --> 01:44.409
- I stretch, do a lot of core work.
- (laughter)

01:44.437 --> 01:45.814
John:
Back to Atlanta.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.375
This is a city that went and found

01:47.407 --> 01:50.513
the biggest mountain in the entire
state of Georgia, Stone Mountain,

01:50.543 --> 01:52.318
and decided it was
a good idea to carve

01:52.345 --> 01:55.656
a bunch of Confederate general's heads
on the side of that mountain.

01:55.682 --> 01:59.095
I don't know, Cam, to me that sounds
like a racist Mount Rushmore.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.326
More like a Mount Racemore.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.800
Guys, this thing was carved
in like the 1980s.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.200
It wasn't like it was made last week.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.034
I mean, plus, they got some
pretty dope hiking trails up there.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.370
But Atlanta's been booing you, Cam.

02:09.395 --> 02:13.138
They were expecting
a Steph Curry-Kyrie Irving combination.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.577
And so far, they've gotten neither.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.909
Well, this is a long season.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.846
You know, narratives
have their chapters.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.044
I let my team down
by missing six games,

02:20.073 --> 02:22.075
but, you know, I'm back,
and I'm ready to bear down and ball.

02:22.108 --> 02:24.054
John:
It's seems to me you've had one good--

02:24.077 --> 02:26.421
Well, I'll even grant you
great playoff run.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.325
Doesn't that make you
Jeremy freakin' Lin?

02:29.349 --> 02:32.796
A capable player
but much more hype than hoop?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.629
Uh.. when you take the big money

02:35.655 --> 02:37.635
and you play badly,
you get heat.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.728
You know, that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.864
But that doubt drives me.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.966
lam going to get
the whole cookie tonight.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.374
I'm gonna be the Cookie Monster.

02:45.398 --> 02:48.174
I'm going to Quincy Market to get
a big bucket full of cookies

02:48.201 --> 02:50.545
- from Boston Chipyard.
- Boston's own Cam Galloway,

02:50.570 --> 02:52.982
ready to down some cookies
and the home team.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.986
Cam, we wish you well,
but not tonight.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.578
- Thank you, Gerry.
- Good to see you, Cam.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.680
- You, too, John.
- Up next on "Dennis and Callahan,"

02:58.711 --> 03:01.453
more bodies found
near Aaron Hernandez home.

03:01.481 --> 03:02.755
Is he responsible?

03:02.782 --> 03:05.388
We'll discuss after brief word
from Dunkin' Donuts.

03:05.418 --> 03:08.558
- (music playing)
- ♪ Whoo ♪

03:10.056 --> 03:12.002
Good morning, baby boy.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.495
Missy's taking us on a field trip
so we can learn more about Georgia.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.939
- Hi, Cam.
- Cam: Hey, Missy.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.533
Come on, Mary Charles, let's go!

03:18.565 --> 03:21.341
- Hey, look, Ma, I found another one!
- Oh, Lord, she done found

03:21.367 --> 03:24.177
- another one of them damn disc jockeys.
- Lawn jockey, Ma.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.512
You know what the fuck
I'm talking 'bout.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.280
It's like an Easter egg hunt
for bigots.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.310
- Here goes, baby, listen to this.
- (M Chuck grunting)

03:31.945 --> 03:34.152
- And another one.
- Cam: Ma, are you there?

03:34.180 --> 03:35.853
- Felt good, didn't it?
- Yeah.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.123
Ma, I left my lucky shorts at home.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.630
Lucky shorts?

03:39.652 --> 03:41.928
He likes to wear
his high school game shorts

03:41.955 --> 03:44.026
underneath his grown-ass man
game shorts.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.196
He thinks it gives him
special powers or some shit.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.967
- Ma! My shorts!
- Cassie: All right!

03:47.994 --> 03:50.099
Mommy already
overnighted 'em to you, baby.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.131
So they're gonna be in Boston
before the game?

03:52.165 --> 03:53.769
What the fuck you think
"overnight" means?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.871
- Thank you, Ma. Yo...
- Wait, Cam, before you go,

03:55.902 --> 03:57.540
make sure you and Reggie
pay it forward.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.948
I need y'all to drop off those
eight rotisserie chickens

03:59.973 --> 04:02.476
to Mabel Oliver, you know,
her husband got laid off.

04:02.508 --> 04:03.953
- Yo, eight chickens.
- They'll take the food,

04:03.977 --> 04:06.253
- but they're not gonna take the money--
- Good-bye, Cam.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.656
Ma, eight chickens?

04:07.680 --> 04:09.660
Come on, how many can
two people eat before they spoil?

04:09.682 --> 04:11.628
Have you ever heard of
a fucking freezer?

04:11.651 --> 04:13.562
Yeah, it's where I'm gonna keep
your body after I chop you up.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.463
Cassie: Girl, I will smother you
in your sleep tonight.

04:15.488 --> 04:18.492
Okay, okay, just to be clear, you two
are actually getting along right now?

04:18.524 --> 04:21.130
- Both: Yeah.
- All right.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.834
We gotta get you back
for a shave and a trim at Norm's.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.809
Look, it's Norm,
it'll mean a lot.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.244
Nah, I got a cold last time
I got a cut from there, man.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.373
That place got a bad vibe
for me now.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.747
Know what? You gotta get back in bed,
get out on a different side.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.809
See, my room is facing
the Charles River.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.514
You got to change that,
'cause last time,

04:36.542 --> 04:39.113
I had a room facing away from the river,
shot the lights out.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.125
Cam, room have fuck all
to do with it.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.593
You don't know what things
got to do with other things.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.186
How they may or may not
be connected.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.323
But that doesn't mean we ignore
the potentials those things can have

04:47.353 --> 04:49.924
on other things and how they influence
the outcome of other things.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.232
It's a hotel room, huh?

04:52.258 --> 04:53.601
What is the possible connection

04:53.626 --> 04:55.902
between the direction your room faces
and how you play?

04:55.928 --> 04:58.534
- God.
- Oh, we're back on God, okay.

04:58.564 --> 05:01.238
- You think God cares where you sleep?
- I don't care, man, I do.

05:01.267 --> 05:04.339
- Pack up your shit, man, I'll fix it.
- Thank you.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.908
- Hey, yo, fuckies.
- Oh, Dirty Paul.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.386
- What's good?
- Yeah, my dick and my gat.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.617
- Oh.
- Please keep 'em both in your pants.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.091
- Hey, we still good on the floor seats?
- Yeah, yeah, they're at will-call.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.720
- 7:00 p.m. tonight.
- Think I get 'em early so I can scalp?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.457
You know I got kids
to feed and whatnot.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.123
Dude, they're floor seat tickets.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.225
We-- we get you floor seat tickets,
you gonna scalp 'em?

05:23.256 --> 05:26.294
- They're worth more money.
- If you need money, I can get you.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.739
Who in life don't need money?
Look, man, I ain't here for no handout.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.901
These fat-cat owners,
they give y'all comp tickets,

05:31.931 --> 05:34.912
- I sell 'em, trickle-down economics.
- That's not really how it works, Dirty.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.607
Okay, well, when you
write a book and shit,

05:36.636 --> 05:38.172
I'll read it and get my facts straight.

05:38.204 --> 05:41.083
Till then, if I go to a game,
I only get a game.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.144
A game I can watch on TV.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.055
If I sell the tickets,
I can get a better TV.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.219
- What about feeding the kids?
- I'm feeding their mind with the TV.

05:49.248 --> 05:52.252
We watch all that
Animal Planet shit, man.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.960
You know there's a ton of different
turtles in the Galapagos Islands?

05:55.988 --> 05:58.525
- My kids do.
- Come to the game, all right?

05:58.558 --> 06:01.596
Bring your sons,
consider it a night out. Here.

06:01.627 --> 06:05.234
- Uh, I got three now.
- Oh, congratulations.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.540
(scoffs)
Only like two of 'em.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.342
The middle one
a spoiled little shit.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.213
Hey, real talk, Cam, Reg...
thank you.

06:12.238 --> 06:15.447
I've been getting my shit together
since things went down with Marcus.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.853
- You a inspiration, man.
- That's what's up.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.515
- All right, all right.
- Yeah.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.185
- My man. Dirty Paul.
- Yeah.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.094
- Yo, you want to fuck my sister tonight?
- Uh, I'm good.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.462
- No offense to you or your sister.
- Oh, nah, none taken.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.093
She got a thing for you,
told me to let you know.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.500
I ain't pimping.

06:31.524 --> 06:34.937
(chuckles) I'm just glad
he didn't pull a gun on us.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.100
- New room now, please.
- New room.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.200
All right, all right, I'm working on it.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.869
- Thank you, man.
- I've got you. I've got you.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.708
(music playing)

06:45.037 --> 06:46.641
(door opens, closes)

06:48.441 --> 06:51.388
All right, pack up, Prince Harry.
I got you a new room.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.551
Call Michael Schlow.
I need a burger from Tico, medium-well.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.923
What is with you?

06:55.948 --> 06:58.895
You need a room away from the river,
lucky shorts, Tico burger.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.920
Last time I was in town,
I had a Tico burger,

07:00.953 --> 07:02.762
and I dropped 38 points
on those guys.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.463
Cam, you were so hot, you could have
dropped 38 points on a 20-foot hoop.

07:05.491 --> 07:08.062
Got fuck all to do with
a Michael Schlow Tico burger.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.903
Now, I will give you
the high school shorts thing,

07:09.929 --> 07:12.341
it's a Jordan homage,
but you're going overboard.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.242
Next thing, you'll be making me
hunt down Connie Hunter

07:14.267 --> 07:15.678
because she blew you
when you beat Natick.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.908
I already Facebooked her--
didn't get no response.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.510
- Take me to Coach Healey.
- Do you let Coach Healey blow you?

07:21.541 --> 07:24.249
No, but he drove 300 miles to Syracuse

07:24.277 --> 07:26.757
to watch me play in
UNH's first ever tourney game.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.814
I killed it!

07:27.847 --> 07:30.657
Cam, you more than proved your worth
at games Coach Healey wasn't there.

07:30.683 --> 07:33.892
Man, I've never slumped
like this before, ever.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.593
I need Coach courtside.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.261
You will shoot your way out of this
like all the greats, but fine.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.500
We will leave your high school
basketball coach a ticket.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.030
Now, I gotta auction off a testicle
to pay for all these tickets.

07:44.063 --> 07:47.408
It's all good, though, my lone testicle
will just log double-time.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.709
Let's hand-deliver it.
The ticket, not your spare nut.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.373
Cam, we ain't got time
to play Pony Express.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.315
You got a Boys Club appearance,
you got your walk-through.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.546
Priorities, Reg!
Coach is "A" number one.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.748
Hey, is this about what
Dennis and Callahan said?

07:57.777 --> 08:00.917
Fuck Dennis and Callahan.
Fuck Felger and Mazz, too, man.

08:00.947 --> 08:04.053
- Fuck everybody in Boston.
- Be grateful that we moved away

08:04.083 --> 08:05.756
and now we only gotta be here
twice a year.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.265

I'm very grateful.

(knocking)

08:57.303 --> 08:59.283
Man:
Come on in, Julie, it's open.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.786
- Yo, Coach!
- Coach Healey...

09:03.809 --> 09:09.122
What? Vaughn, Calloway,
as I live and breathe.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.253
I thought you were my niece
bringing me lunch.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.820
To what do I owe this pleasure?

09:12.852 --> 09:14.889
I'm back in town,
got a game tonight.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.128
Just taking the time to see
one of our favorite people.

09:17.156 --> 09:20.865
Oh, I thought it was good when that
new truck appeared out of the blue.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.271
This is even better.
Can I get you something?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.537
Water?
A Diet Coke?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.704
- I'm good.
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.804
- Well, sit down.
- All right.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.974
I know you guys
are probably running around,

09:32.004 --> 09:35.042
but it's been a couple of years
since we laid eyes on each other.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.519
- Yeah.
- You both look great!

09:36.542 --> 09:38.488
Thank you, Coach.
Man, feeling good.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.513
How's the, uh, how's the team
looking this year, Coach?

09:40.546 --> 09:43.083
Ah, no longer coaching
high school basketball.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.617
Moved on to the next chapter.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.460
It's time I focus on the things
I've been neglecting, you know?

09:47.486 --> 09:50.160
Like being home,
work on myself for once.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.795
How's Mrs. H, man?
We'd love to say hey.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.328
Ah, she left me
a couple of months ago.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.933
Cammy boy, hey,
you're putting some muscle on.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.844
Look at you,
you're like a superhero.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.542
Yeah, I've been Captain Bricks lately.

10:05.571 --> 10:09.178
You just remember that gorgeous
follow-through of yours.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.018
Shoulders square, wrist loose,

10:12.044 --> 10:15.321
real smooth like this.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.522
You do that tonight, Boston doesn't
stand a chance against you.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.327
And I'll be watching
as I always do.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.857
Got the cable
full season league package.

10:23.889 --> 10:28.099
(sighs) Tonight, Coach,
you're gonna watch courtside.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.506
Oh, Cam,
that's so sweet of you, really.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.032
But I can't, I got plans.

10:33.065 --> 10:36.535
- Change 'em, man, I need you there.
- Maybe next time.

10:36.569 --> 10:39.914
I know you guys got places to be,
so I'm gonna let you go,

10:39.939 --> 10:42.545
- but I really appreciate the gesture.
- (sighs)

10:42.575 --> 10:44.521
Love to have you at this game, Coach.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.217
Well, give me notice next time
and I'll clear my calendar,

10:47.246 --> 10:49.055
but tonight no can do.

10:49.081 --> 10:52.756
Hey, I'm so happy you fellas stopped by.
You know I love you guys.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.856
- Hey, it's our pleasure, Coach.
- All right, take care.

10:54.887 --> 10:58.630
- Let's go.
- And, Cam, I'm proud of you.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.070
Keep the faith.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.472
Later, Coach. Yup.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.442
- All right.
- Okay.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.605
(Reggie whispers)
Damn...

11:11.137 --> 11:14.118
Ooh...
(exhales sharply)

11:15.141 --> 11:16.552
(car alarm chirps)

11:16.575 --> 11:19.818
This truck hasn't moved
since we had it delivered.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.825
Yo, that means he's been like that
for five months.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.123
Yeah, you don't swell like that
in five months, man.

11:24.150 --> 11:27.256
That's gotta be five years of just
eating like shit and saying fuck it.

11:27.286 --> 11:30.995
I sent him a ticket last year when
I was on Memphis, he didn't come then.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.902
And now we know why. Listen, there's
nothing that we can do right now.

11:33.926 --> 11:36.236
- Let's go, Cam.
- I feel horrible, man.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.071
You know what?
Say a prayer. God's got it.

11:38.097 --> 11:42.671
- What plans could Coach possibly have?
- My guess... dinner plans.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.376
Hey, hey, come on.
Don't do that. That's not cool.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.611
All right, this is Coach
we talking about, a man in need.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.621
Coach is not a man who's deprived
himself of anything lately.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.850
He helped make me who I am, Reg.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.586
Cam, we got 36 more hours
before we gotta leave town.

11:55.614 --> 11:58.424
We cannot help what is
wrong with Coach, okay?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.624
Now, look, has he gotten big?
Yes. Hell, he's enormous.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.599
But it's not like it was
some freak accident.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.828
Not like he tripped and then he fell
into a giant milk shake.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.701
I mean, that, what you saw right there,
man, that's deliberate action.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.173
Aided and abetted
by some niece named Julie.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.439
Now we got shit to do and that shit
is not on our to-do list today.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.174
That's not shit.
That's Coach.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.512
Out of work, divorced.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.677
We're all a couple of tough breaks away
from being in the exact same place.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.551
There isn't enough space
to be in the same place as Coach.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.716
- Stop-- stop with the jokes, Reg.
- Okay.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.158
Let's get him to the game, man.
Lift his spirits.

12:29.181 --> 12:31.787
Got a forklift for his spirits?

12:31.817 --> 12:33.797
I'm sorry, Cam,
but he doesn't want to go.

12:33.819 --> 12:36.959
He doesn't think he can go.
I'm not gonna turn my back on Coach.

12:36.989 --> 12:40.402
- He would never turn his back on me.
- He can't turn his back on you

12:40.426 --> 12:43.464
or anyone else because he physically
can't turn his back.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.203
And that's not your fault.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.904
That's the fault of
some niece named Julie

12:46.932 --> 12:49.538
and whoever else kept feeding him
until he couldn't stand up anymore.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.878
You didn't dig that ditch,
you didn't make him fat,

12:51.904 --> 12:53.383
and you did not make him fatter.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.181
I can still help him out.
I can get him out of that ditch.

12:56.208 --> 13:00.122
He's the only one that I want there,
man, fuck everybody else in this town.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.682
Get him to the game.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.990
I'd have to remove a wall
to do that, Cam.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.587
Do what you gotta do,
but get him to the game.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.632
Fucking sugar and carbs.
God!

13:12.658 --> 13:16.105
(music playing)

13:17.797 --> 13:20.573
- (sheep bleating)
- (children laughing)

13:20.599 --> 13:23.773
So do you think real slaves
sang like that?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.840
Because those fake slaves
were getting down.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.351
- I mean, they sounded like K-Ci <i>&</i> JoJo.
- Who cares, Ma?

13:28.374 --> 13:30.513
- This place is racist.
- What, planet Earth?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.887
- Come on, grow up.
- History wasn't pretty.

13:32.912 --> 13:36.018
But if bad history isn't shared,
bad history will repeat itself.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.891
Bad history does not
need to be reenacted.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.160
I don't see no fake Jews at Auschwitz
singing "We love taking showers."

13:41.187 --> 13:43.497
Well, I think that
having actors portray slaves,

13:43.522 --> 13:47.334
living, breathing people in front of us,
reminds us that slavery was real.

13:47.359 --> 13:49.965
- Who needs reminding?
- That one slave had capped teeth.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.269
Took me right out of it.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.709
(Southern accent)
Good afternoon, fine people.

13:53.732 --> 13:55.643
My name is Hazel-Fay Watney,

13:55.668 --> 13:57.579
wife to Timothy Watney,

13:57.603 --> 14:00.311
and welcome to our working plantation.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.115
Are there any questions
before the tour begins? Yes?

14:03.142 --> 14:06.282
Yes, how many times a day do you think
what a horrible person you are?

14:06.312 --> 14:08.553
Oh, we are a Christian family.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.424
I attend church every Sunday,

14:10.449 --> 14:12.656
we read the Bible,
and repent when we sin.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.255
You must be repenting all day.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.926
Missy:
The architecture is interesting.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.629
Can you speak about house design?

14:18.657 --> 14:22.969
Oh, yes,
we built this house in 1841.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.475
By "we," you mean a bunch of
human beings at the end of your whip.

14:25.497 --> 14:28.740
Oh, pure, hardworking,
wonderful people

14:28.767 --> 14:31.111
assisted in the building of
this plantation,

14:31.136 --> 14:34.083
and we are very grateful
for their tireless work.

14:34.106 --> 14:37.110
And, well, we certainly
couldn't have done it without them.

14:37.142 --> 14:40.749
Can you list their birthdays
or do you celebrate their auction dates?

14:40.779 --> 14:45.990
They celebrate their lives every day
through camaraderie and song.

14:46.018 --> 14:49.625
You do realize this whole owning slave
thing doesn't end well for you, yes?

14:49.655 --> 14:53.262
Summers are notoriously hot
on the plantation,

14:53.292 --> 14:57.104
and the only thing sought after more
than our precious tobacco

14:57.129 --> 14:59.166
is a nice cool glass of iced tea.

14:59.198 --> 15:03.237
Now, then, I would love to
invite you into our kitchen

15:03.269 --> 15:05.476
to show you how
the meals were prepared.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.212
Are there any other questions?

15:08.240 --> 15:11.346
- No? Okay.
- Hey, excuse me. I'm raising my hand.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.221
Can you not see it? I've got
the light-skinned side toward you.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.920
Listen, would you please let
Tinker Bell do the tour, okay?

15:16.949 --> 15:18.656
- I'm trying to take pictures.
- Nah, Ma.

15:18.684 --> 15:21.221
I'm gonna go jump in an Uber
and let some old white man

15:21.253 --> 15:23.631
reverse "Driving Miss M-Chuck"
me home.

15:23.656 --> 15:28.537
Come on, Mary Charles.
Mary Charles!

15:28.560 --> 15:31.871
Uber doesn't even
come out on plantations.

15:31.897 --> 15:35.606
Cam, I am at the front door.
It's the address that you gave me.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.308
Look, I'll knock one more time
and then I gotta go. Bye.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.977
- (phone beeps)
- Hey. Hey, Mabel, listen.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.509
I'm not trying to break in,
I just want to leave you some chickens.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.819
I will pay to take out a door,
a wall, hell, the whole roof.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.155
I just gotta get
this really fat guy out.

15:52.318 --> 15:53.490
Hey, hey-

15:53.519 --> 15:56.432
I don't mean to bother you, but what
you got going on later on today?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.662
(music playing)

15:59.792 --> 16:02.636
Cam, I'm at the arena.
I'm waiting on the guy in charge here.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.540
I'm trying to get Coach situated, okay?

16:05.564 --> 16:07.237
You must be the guy
looking to talk to me.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.268
- I gotta go, I gotta go. Yeah.
- I'm Joe Connelly, I'm in charge.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.905
What's this shit-show you're trying to
put this arena through

16:10.936 --> 16:13.473
- as a favor to you?
- My cousin Cam plays for Atlanta.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.507
- I don't give a fuck.
- No, I'm just trying to explain.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.953
Details that help will help.
Details that don't won't.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.685
And for your information,
this is not Atlanta, it's Boston.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.125
I know.
And, yeah, and my cousin is from Boston.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.718
- Where exactly?
- Dorchester.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.230
Dorchester's Dorchester
and Boston's Boston.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.697
It's got two different names.
You know why?

16:28.721 --> 16:30.064
'Cause it's two different places.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.865
Fucking Magellan over here
thinks Dorchester's Boston proper.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.372
Dorchester is Boston's
biggest neighborhood.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.775
What, are you Boston.gov?

16:40.799 --> 16:43.109
For your information, when people from
Dorchester are asked where they're from,

16:43.135 --> 16:45.137
they say Dorchester.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.446
They don't start with Boston
and then say Dorchester.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.386
Well, I'm from the Dorchester part
of Boston, okay?

16:50.409 --> 16:54.084
And I just need a little help getting a
very large man here for tonight's game.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.592
How very large?

16:55.614 --> 16:58.595
Like those two fat twins on the mini
bikes in the Guinness Book of Records?

16:58.617 --> 17:01.097
Or that fat fucking lard-ass
they buried in a piano coffin?

17:01.120 --> 17:03.566
- More like the piano one.
- I'm in charge of this arena,

17:03.589 --> 17:05.967
not the liposuction unit
at the Mass General Hospital

17:05.991 --> 17:08.597
where it sounds like your Coach
Piano Case needs to be.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.607
(laughter)

17:10.628 --> 17:12.801
Okay, look, I know this,
uh, this request

17:12.830 --> 17:15.141
is a little larger than
your average pain in the ass,

17:15.166 --> 17:20.013
so I asked around and I found out
what you like to drink.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.950
Who'd you ask, one of
my enemies from Belfast?

17:21.973 --> 17:24.420
Belfast? I--
Look, man, I--

17:24.443 --> 17:27.287
- That's a 21-year-old bottle.
- Yeah, Bushmills.

17:27.311 --> 17:28.791
You know, you got balls
as big as church bells

17:28.814 --> 17:30.487
coming in here trying to bribe me
with Proddy whiskey.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.018
Is that not Irish whiskey?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.429
That's alcohol
made in Northern Ireland.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.364
The label says "Irish whiskey."

17:36.388 --> 17:39.369
Yeah, because if it said "Northern Irish
whiskey," no one would buy it.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.302
I thought Irish whiskey
was Irish whiskey.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.966
- You think like most racists.
. D..

17:43.996 --> 17:46.135
You think Northern Ireland
is the same as regular Ireland.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.270
And you think that Irish people
only speak English

17:48.300 --> 17:50.541
as opposed to their own fucking
language that was stolen from them.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.071
And you don't know
that a part of Ireland

17:52.104 --> 17:54.380
is an occupied country
separated from its true self,

17:54.406 --> 17:56.079
and that drinking that
Protestant whiskey

17:56.108 --> 17:58.418
is one of the most self-hating things
an Irishman can do.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.890
I'm Catholic.
I drink Jameson.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.018
I didn't think any of these things

18:03.048 --> 18:06.222
because I have no idea
what any of them mean, no offense.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.494
- Who are you again?
- I'm C-- I'm Cam Calloway's cousin.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.125
I still don't give a fuck.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.602
You know, he repped this area
when he took Saint McGuire to state's.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.196
I went to Holy Name
and we hate you St. McGuire cunts.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.935
Bunch of cunty,
conceited pricks

18:17.963 --> 18:20.341
who we used to kick
the fucking shit out of in hockey.

18:20.365 --> 18:24.507
And I happened to be the captain of
the 1983 Division Ill championship team.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.380
Well, congratulations.
Listen, I just need a comfortable place

18:27.406 --> 18:29.750
for his old coach to sit
and watch the game.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.415
I got an idea.
How about at home in his bed?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.651
And maybe the bed next to that one
and the bed next to that one?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.682
(laughter)

18:38.684 --> 18:42.029
- Are there any handicapped seats?
- Yeah, for handicapped people.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.056
Those who God
or misfortune fucked up.

18:44.089 --> 18:46.228
Not for those who Fluffernuttered
themself into oblivion.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.862
I know that you can do this.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.499
So-- so please, you-you tell me
what you want from me

18:50.529 --> 18:52.600
because I desperately need
to get this done.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.942
Finally a five-letter word
we can understand-- please.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.608
There's six letters in "please."
I just...

18:58.637 --> 19:00.776
- You busting my balls?
- I'm not-- I'm just...

19:00.806 --> 19:03.377
I fucking love it.
Come on, Dorchester.

19:03.408 --> 19:06.218
Come on, we'll help you out.

19:06.245 --> 19:07.690
Hey, fuckballs, this is Joe.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.592
Listen, I want Johnny, Tommy,
Mark, Brendan, Kevin, Connor,

19:10.616 --> 19:14.291
uh, Tommy B, Liam, and Tom Welch
in my office right now.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.431
Oh, yeah, and bring Jamal.
He's one of your guys.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.299
(music playing)

19:22.327 --> 19:26.036
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Mr. Shuck and Mr. Jive.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.374
I'm just wondering when you two
bumped your fucking heads

19:28.400 --> 19:30.539
and decided to lose your sense
of black pride.

19:30.569 --> 19:34.142
How did these fucking crackers
get you two to do this minstrel show?

19:34.173 --> 19:37.416
- I'm trying to pay off my truck.
- I got four kids.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.548
You're gonna be a great role model
for them, I want you to know that.

19:40.579 --> 19:43.025
(normal accent)
Hey, dudes, break's over.

19:43.048 --> 19:46.427
- Chantell needs you back at the livery.
- Yeah, back to it.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.089
You should be real proud of yourselves.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.329
And you, taking a break
from spreading hate?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.462
I get you're offended, okay?
It is what it is.

19:54.493 --> 19:58.532
- No, what it isn't is cool.
- You know what? I'm an actor, okay?

19:58.564 --> 20:01.909
My agent got me this gig.
Somebody's gotta play the villain.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.005
Do you hate the guy
who played Darth Vader?

20:04.036 --> 20:07.882
Hey, that guy is James Earl Jones.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.749
He is a national treasure.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.948
And that movie is "Star Wars."

20:11.977 --> 20:14.116
It's-it's fiction. It's for kids.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.752
This thing here,
it's like you're...

20:16.782 --> 20:18.921
it's like you're making slavery
into Disneyland.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.761
Look, you know what?
I'm not crazy about this gig, okay?

20:21.787 --> 20:24.267
But I'm trying.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.702
Why would you take this gig
if you're not crazy about it?

20:27.726 --> 20:29.831
I've got student loans
I gotta pay off.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.740
I was up in New York
trying to be an actor.

20:32.764 --> 20:35.040
My dad shoots himself in the face.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.048
I gotta come back here,
take care of him.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.483
He says he was just cleaning his gun.
I don't believe him.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.543
Now half of his jaw is missing.

20:45.677 --> 20:49.887
Fuck. Sorry.

20:52.551 --> 20:55.896
What are you listening to?

20:55.921 --> 20:58.561
Indigo Girls.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.298
Which album?

21:01.326 --> 21:02.828
You're gonna rip apart my house

21:02.861 --> 21:05.000
and tow me eight miles
to go to a basketball game?

21:05.030 --> 21:07.203
5.3 up 93 North.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.712
Coach, I can't tell you how much
your support meant to me.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.273
Forklifts, cranes, pulleys,
tarps, flatbed trucks--

21:13.305 --> 21:14.716
are you out of your mind?

21:14.740 --> 21:17.448
- A stunt like that could kill me.
- I'm trying to help you, Coach.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.546
You want to help me?

21:18.577 --> 21:22.218
Well, get some bridge cable
and build me a zip line to the shitter.

21:22.247 --> 21:25.387
Coach, I understand that life
has knocked you down,

21:25.417 --> 21:26.896
but you-- you don't gotta stay there.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.727
You'll see how much
you inspire me, man,

21:28.754 --> 21:31.667
and it'll all come back--
how great of a person you are.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.102
Cam, bring it in.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.402
Excuse me.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.375
I was your high school
basketball coach.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.844
And honestly,
a mediocre one at best.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.643
I didn't do anything for you
that any other coach wouldn't have done.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.343
You started me
my sophomore year.

21:46.371 --> 21:50.444
Because you were quicker, stronger,
and better than anyone else on the team.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.888
That's not called being a great coach.
That's called not being a fucking idiot.

21:53.912 --> 21:56.358
Coach, you gotta change up
your life, man.

21:56.381 --> 21:58.190
And change is not coming in this bed.

21:58.216 --> 22:00.753
I need you.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.824
I've never slumped like this before,
ever, on any level.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.391
You're my good luck charm.

22:05.424 --> 22:09.463
Cam, this fixating on me being
a solution to all your woes

22:09.494 --> 22:11.770
means one thing--
you're depressed.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.573
You gotta look into it.
You gotta check it out for yourself.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.909
I'm good.
I got all I need.

22:16.935 --> 22:21.042
You're here, man.
You're alone, immobile.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.484
I'm not alone.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.647
I got a niece that comes by to visit,
brings me food, helps me out.

22:25.677 --> 22:30.854
I got great DSL service, you know,
Netflix, watch a ton of documentaries.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.486
I got great social network friends.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.327
I'm taking online courses
from the University of Phoenix.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.834
I got my Sudoku.
I got word search.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.427
I'm blessed.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.439
Maybe I was born to be this way.

22:42.461 --> 22:46.204
Are you just gonna stand there
and be useless?

22:46.231 --> 22:49.644
You got any idea what I've been through
in the last six hours for you?

22:49.668 --> 22:52.740
- This is what matters. Help me.
- You want me to help you?

22:52.771 --> 22:55.217
- Yeah!
- Okay, how about

22:55.240 --> 22:57.914
I put a gun to his head,
I drag him out of bed,

22:57.943 --> 23:00.822
and I'll roll him to the game myself
just so he can be your good luck Buddha.

23:00.846 --> 23:02.553
This ain't about Coach.

23:02.581 --> 23:05.061
This is about you needing to
not fold under the pressure

23:05.083 --> 23:07.085
because this pressure is the job.

23:07.119 --> 23:10.259
So nut up and deal with it 'cause it
ain't going anywhere anytime soon.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.996
Coach:
Excuse me, Reggie.

23:13.024 --> 23:15.937
Would you do me a favor
and pass me my cistern?

23:15.961 --> 23:19.431
- Your what?
- My piss jug.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.907
- (sloshing)
- I'm gonna need a minute.

23:25.937 --> 23:28.474
But I'm also gonna need a hand.

23:28.507 --> 23:31.852

How much underwear is under here?

23:53.832 --> 23:56.540
A lot.

23:56.568 --> 24:00.539
- It better be worth it.
- It is.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.749
(music playing)

24:04.776 --> 24:07.814
Gerry, Cam Calloway
struggled big time last night.

24:07.846 --> 24:10.827
4 of 20 from the floor,
a measly 10 points.

24:10.849 --> 24:13.022
Boston handily beats Atlanta at home.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.292
- Should have had more cookies.
- Maybe a lot more cookies.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.800
- This kid's in a slump.
- He's been in a slump for a long time.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.234
John: I'm almost starting
to feel sorry for him.

24:19.257 --> 24:21.328
Gerry: He's thinking too much,
it's all in his head.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.430
- (radio shuts off)
- (door opens, closes)

24:23.462 --> 24:25.965
- Yo.
- (Cam scoffs)

24:25.997 --> 24:29.501
Yo, how does Mom
not know what overnight is?

24:29.534 --> 24:32.014
She two-dayed
these fucking things, man.

24:32.037 --> 24:33.414
If I would have had them for the game--

24:33.438 --> 24:35.816
Hey, you know what,
maybe my mind is playing tricks on me,

24:35.841 --> 24:39.448
but a few weeks ago, I thought I heard
you say that you were a grown-ass man.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.424
- Yeah?
- Aw, man.

24:41.446 --> 24:43.153
And then a few months before that,
all you talked about

24:43.181 --> 24:45.889
was how you wanted to
carry a team on your shoulders.

24:45.917 --> 24:48.864
You're acting like a child, Cam.

24:48.887 --> 24:52.232
Can't even carry yourself.
Now, listen, I'll keep doing it.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.601
All your weak-minded,
piddly-ass,

24:54.626 --> 24:57.470
peccadillo,
superstitious bullshit, I will.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.739
But what saddens me the most
is that you keep asking me to do it.

25:00.765 --> 25:03.507
Because it means
that you ain't growing.

25:03.535 --> 25:06.482
And all this-- all this drama
that you create, man,

25:06.505 --> 25:08.951
you don't even realize,
but it is beneath you.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.955
(Cam sighs)

25:11.977 --> 25:14.924
So who you gonna be, Cam?

25:14.946 --> 25:16.948
'Cause you're better than this.

25:26.925 --> 25:29.269
Fine.

25:29.294 --> 25:32.832
- Get rid of 'em.
- Will do.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.677
Yo, Coach needs surgery.
Set it up.

25:38.703 --> 25:43.311
Do you know how much lipo
has to be suctioned out of that man?

25:43.341 --> 25:47.687
- I mean, that's just a lot of lipo.
- Man, I don't care about that.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.022
