WEBVTT

00:11.929 --> 00:14.263
- Take it, Sarge. Take it.
- Oh, I'll take it.

00:23.899 --> 00:24.899
Yeah.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.118
Yo! Yo! Turn that back on.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.369
Yeah, man,
what'd you do?

00:36.495 --> 00:38.496
Don't look at me, 'cause you know I
didn't do it. All right?

00:38.622 --> 00:41.124
Hey! You better have put fresh batteries
in that thing like I told you.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.085
No. I did, Sarge. Right when
you gave them to me. I did.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.088
- I put them in.
- Well, then hit it or something.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.133
Otherwise you all
are gonna have to listen to me sing!

01:25.043 --> 01:26.002
Here.

01:28.714 --> 01:32.967
Don't panic.
Don't shoot us. Don't die.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.928
You got it, G?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.144
Go! Go! Go!

01:58.160 --> 01:59.660
Up and at them.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.914
You're supposed to
be in clinic duty.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.918
Yeah, like I can sleep down there with
all the crying and coughing.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.586
Here.

02:08.712 --> 02:11.464
Ex-Marine thinks
he has Gulf War syndrome.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.217
- There's no such thing.
- So he's been told.

02:14.343 --> 02:18.596
It hasn't stopped the unexplained
fatigue, rashes and joint pain.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.808
And just so you know, he's the nephew
of a benefactor I owe a favor,

02:21.934 --> 02:24.644
so you're gonna take this case
whether you like it or not.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.146
Why wouldn't I want
to take the case?

02:27.523 --> 02:31.234
The guy's tired and sore.
It's gonna be chapter one in my...

02:36.907 --> 02:40.952
Don't panic.
Don't shoot us. Don't die.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.498
You know him?

02:45.916 --> 02:47.959
Never met him
before in my life.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.879
Okay. Well, you're about to.
He's on his way here.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.341
Get your ass up and get your team
together. You have work to do.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.514
- That's amazing.
- No, it's not.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.435
- It's not?
- I can play the harmonica with my nose,

03:47.561 --> 03:51.314
make a penny come out of a child's ear,
or any other orifice for that matter,

03:51.440 --> 03:55.109
and given the right circumstances can
bring two women to simultaneous ecstasy.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.361
The right circumstances
being their agreement

03:57.487 --> 03:58.821
to bill you on
the same credit card.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.866
But what I absolutely cannot do
is dream about someone

04:01.992 --> 04:03.701
I've never seen before.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.455
Well, just because you don't understand
it doesn't mean it can't happen.

04:07.581 --> 04:11.125
True. It can't happen
because it can't happen!

04:12.127 --> 04:15.504
Well, maybe you didn't dream
about this guy specifically.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.674
Right. Just some other guy
who looks exactly like him.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.218
No. You imagined
some generic Marine,

04:21.345 --> 04:24.680
then you placed his face
in the dream after you saw the picture.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.350
Sort of a coincidence mixed
with a little déjà vu.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.852
There's no record
of him ever coming into the clinic,

04:29.978 --> 04:31.771
so I must've seen him
before somewhere else.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.023
Fine. You've known him
since Cub Scouts.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.360
The more interesting question
isn't what you dreamed, but why.

04:37.486 --> 04:41.948
I'm guessing you're longing for either
a renewed relationship with your dad,

04:43.283 --> 04:45.534
or a new relationship
with one of the Village People.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.578
He was in the Navy,
not the Marines.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.122
I thought your dad
was in the Marines.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.916
The guy in
the Village People.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.127
Actually he's only in the Navy
when they sing In the Navy.

04:55.253 --> 04:58.339
The rest of the time
he's just in generic fatigue.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.008
What?

05:01.843 --> 05:03.177
You brought it up!

05:05.389 --> 05:07.723
- You didn't flush.
- I didn't pee.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.690
Male, 34, just got out of the Marines
after two years in Iraq.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.275
Admitted complaining
of chronic fatigue,

05:18.402 --> 05:21.737
joint pains, intermittent rashes
and sore throats.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.531
Thinks he has
Gulf War syndrome.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.032
Why is he here
instead of the VA?

05:25.158 --> 05:28.202
Because he has a rich uncle
Cuddy's trying to avoid fellating,

05:28.328 --> 05:31.372
who doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis
of nothingswrongatosis.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.665
The VA's right.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.542
There's no such thing
as Gulf War syndrome,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.961
especially in veterans
who've never served in the Gulf War.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.379
Different war, same place.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.048
Whatever was there
in 1990 is still there.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.925
What's there can send you home
in a pine box

05:43.051 --> 05:45.219
but it can't make you sick three months
after you've gotten home.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.306
What, so thousands of soldiers
are lying about their symptoms?

05:49.433 --> 05:52.518
You send 700,000 people
on a vacation to Hawaii,

05:52.644 --> 05:53.519
some are gonna come back sick.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.979
Doesn't mean it was
caused by snorkeling.

05:55.105 --> 05:55.980
He's right.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.190
The studies all show the same pattern
of symptoms in veterans

05:58.316 --> 06:00.568
who were sent to the Gulf
and those who weren't.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.652
That's it?

06:01.778 --> 06:03.237
You believe her but not me?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.114
Stick to your guns, Chase.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.283
Just 'cause there isn't
a single unifying symptom

06:07.409 --> 06:08.909
doesn't mean there isn't
something going on.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.578
It could just affect
everyone differently.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.621
You think this guy has
Gulf War syndrome?

06:12.748 --> 06:14.081
Of course not.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.584
He's depressed
and he's looking for a disability check,

06:16.710 --> 06:19.670
most likely because he's just realized
that knowing how to barter for sex

06:19.796 --> 06:22.590
in six languages and open a beer bottle
with your eye socket

06:22.716 --> 06:24.467
are not the most
marketable skills.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.426
Why did you take
this case?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.470
'Cause a good scientist
continually questions

06:27.596 --> 06:29.638
his own theories
and assumptions.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.600
- Cuddy's making him.
- And now I'm making you.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.644
Do a full physical and recheck
his blood for HIV, hep C,

06:35.771 --> 06:38.481
malaria, schistosomiasis,
and T strain A. Baumannii,

06:38.607 --> 06:40.691
just to make sure
the VA's dotted their I's.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.277
And find out every hospital and clinic
he's ever visited,

06:43.403 --> 06:48.616
every city he's ever lived in
and whether he's ever been on TV.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.825
TV?

06:49.951 --> 06:52.078
Problem could be neurological.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.955
Everyone knows
TV rots your brain.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.502
Well, it's usually the worst
on my palms and the bottom of my feet.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.671
I get these
black dots all over.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.549
- I don't see anything.
- It comes and goes.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.427
You're sure it's not
just scrapes and bruises?

07:09.554 --> 07:12.014
I know the difference between
a rash and a bruise.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.767
Sometimes it's harder than you realize
to distinguish between the two.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.519
You obviously exercise.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.312
My problems aren't caused
by my workouts.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.730
But you do work out.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.649
And by the look of you,
pretty strenuously.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.776
That's not usually
the case with patients

07:23.902 --> 07:26.403
whose principal complaint
is chronic fatigue and joint pain.

07:26.530 --> 07:30.157
I was in the Marines for 12 years.
I'm used to doing PT every day.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.910
Just because I can push through the pain
doesn't mean it's not there.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.703
We're not saying
we don't believe you.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.372
The hell you aren't.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.959
We just need to be specific about
what exactly the problems are.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.047
I sleep 10 hours a night
but I feel tired all the time.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.217
I constantly get coughs,
rashes, sore throats.

07:48.343 --> 07:51.345
My knees and hips feel like someone
poured sand in my joints.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.681
Get these weird tingling
sensations in my legs.

07:53.807 --> 07:57.977
Sometimes they're cold. Other times,
feels like my blood is boiling.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.354
Specific enough?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.109
Look, I don't care
what you guys call it.

08:05.235 --> 08:09.071
Gulf War syndrome, Iraq fever,
or just crappy sickness X.

08:09.197 --> 08:13.159
I just want someone to figure out what
it is so they can cure it.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.495
Except for the supposed
pain in his joints,

08:16.621 --> 08:19.206
none of the other symptoms he's
complaining about are currently evident.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.458
And besides low potassium,
probably caused by him

08:21.585 --> 08:23.335
over-hydrating
after working out.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.545
His blood work's all normal.

08:24.671 --> 08:28.507
Low potassium could also probably be
caused by the experimental vaccines

08:28.633 --> 08:31.927
and anti-chemical warfare pills he was
given before he deployed to Iraq.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.721
Not to mention the fact
that whole country is littered

08:33.847 --> 08:35.306
with hundreds of tons
of radioactive shrapnel

08:35.432 --> 08:37.600
from depleted uranium munitions.

08:37.726 --> 08:38.976
You go to medical school in France?

08:39.102 --> 08:40.853
There's no trace of uranium in his
urine.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.105
And he was given the vaccines
and meds two years ago

08:43.231 --> 08:45.482
without any allergic
or adverse reaction.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.693
Has he ever done
any modeling?

08:47.819 --> 08:49.653
We forgot to ask.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.697
We should send his urine to
the University of Leicester.

08:51.823 --> 08:52.781
There's a professor there
who's developed

08:52.908 --> 08:54.909
a more advanced
screening technique for uranium.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.869
If the levels are too low
for us to detect,

08:56.995 --> 09:00.164
they're way too low to cause any damage.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.541
Where are you going?

09:02.918 --> 09:04.168
This way.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.004
You find out about any television
or other media exposure?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.340
Do you really care or are you just
trying to waste hospital resources

09:09.466 --> 09:11.592
to get back at Cuddy
for making you take the case?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.260
Of course, I care.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.554
What a horrible thing to say.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.182
Do a Lexis-Nexis search and get a copy
of his credit report.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.809
Before or after we
tell him to eat a banana

09:20.936 --> 09:22.269
and discharge him with a psych referral?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.479
I say before.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.398
And I say in between
give him a polysomnogram.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.985
Sleep apnea could cause
chronic fatigue and paranoia.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.821
And find out where he went
to summer camp.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.243
You okay?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.329
Yeah. Just a little too
much coffee this morning.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.332
Were we walking you to
the bathroom?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.291
I wish.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.838
Wilson was just in there.
These guys know what I'm talking about.

09:53.176 --> 09:56.053
That's his third REM cycle and
his breathing's completely normal.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.264
There's obviously nothing wrong
with his sleep pattern.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.100
If it's not the uranium, it's got
to be some other sort of toxin.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.434
Or nothing at all.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.894
You really think there's something
wrong,

10:04.020 --> 10:06.021
or you just want Foreman to be wrong?

10:06.147 --> 10:07.147
Both.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.857
Well, it's not
his sleep pattern.

10:08.984 --> 10:11.944
If you really think it's a toxin, you
can do a liver biopsy in the morning.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.153
We can't leave.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.948
If we don't monitor the whole test,
House won't accept the results.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.366
He'll just make us
do it over.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.617
It doesn't take two doctors
to monitor

10:18.743 --> 10:21.578
what's clearly gonna be
a normal polysomnogram.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.039
Oh, so you want me to stay?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.541
You're the one that thought
there was something wrong.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.376
I never said
it was a sleep disorder.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.336
You wanna flip for it?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.048
Just go.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.927
Oh, come on. Don't be a baby.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.057
Fine. I'll stay.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.232
You know what we could do?

10:55.572 --> 10:56.905
- Here?
- Why not?

10:57.032 --> 10:59.033
We're surrounded by
empty rooms with beds in them.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.535
Yeah.
And video cameras, too.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.662
- So we turn them off.
- Yeah, that's all I need is

11:03.788 --> 11:05.247
House or Foreman
walking in on us.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.082
We have the keys.

11:08.251 --> 11:11.378
No. What if he wakes up?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.629
All right.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.969
Suit yourself.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.573
Damn it.

12:25.328 --> 12:29.331
Hello?
Is anybody out there?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.460
I think there's
a problem in here!

12:37.006 --> 12:38.048
What's wrong?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.592
What do you mean, "What's wrong?"
You don't smell that?

12:40.718 --> 12:41.927
Nothing smells, John.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.346
Oh, are you kidding me?
It's disgusting.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.349
How long have
you thought... Wait.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.352
Open your mouth.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.192
The smell's not in the room.
It's in your mouth.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.405
What's going on?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.490
Good question.

13:41.696 --> 13:42.696
What?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.532
You were wrong about
the nothingswrongatosis.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.242
You can fake fatigue
and joint pain,

13:47.368 --> 13:50.037
but you can't fake
bacterial vaginosis in your mouth.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.121
Where's his mouth been?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.540
Says he hasn't performed
oral sex on anyone in over a year.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.709
Selfish bastard.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.879
Because he hasn't been with anyone since
his last girlfriend dumped him

13:59.005 --> 14:00.672
after he deployed to Iraq
the second time.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.132
Selfish bitch.

14:02.884 --> 14:06.553
We've ruled out HIV, diabetes
and any other endocrine abnormality.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.639
Could be autoimmune.
Sjögren's decreases salivary flow,

14:09.098 --> 14:10.641
creates a hospitable
home for bacteria.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.351
No. His eyes and tear ducts
are fine.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.852
Who was his last girlfriend?

14:14.896 --> 14:17.147
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

14:17.273 --> 14:21.318
Chronic fatigue, joint pain and
opportunistic infection spells cancer.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.903
Probably lymphoma.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.156
We should biopsy his
tonsillarand submandibular lymph nodes.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.575
Right about cancer,
wrong about lymphoma.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.037
Unless you're simply hiding the fact
that his lymphnodes are swollen.

14:32.163 --> 14:36.250
Get Wilson to biopsy his salivary
glands. He's got parotid cancer.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.544
And see if you can get to the truth
about who he's been dating.

14:38.670 --> 14:42.256
No way, a Marine goes a year without
getting some bloodon his bayonet.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.216
It's not an STD.
You just said...

14:44.342 --> 14:45.425
Just do it.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.473
The antibiotics should
at least relieve the infection,

14:51.599 --> 14:53.892
which will reduce the odor
and taste in your mouth.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.477
Not soon enough.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.151
All right.
You're gonna feel a little burn.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.904
You know I never even dipped?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.283
Chewing tobacco.
Practically everyone in my unit did it.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.953
But me. I was so paranoid
about cancer.

15:13.997 --> 15:18.458
Well, if it's parotid cancer,
it's very treatable if diagnosed early.

15:19.794 --> 15:23.505
My mom had cancer, which is why I know
that diagnosing cancer early

15:23.631 --> 15:26.008
means before
there's any serious symptoms.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.725
Certainly tastes like a pretty serious
symptom, you know?

15:34.851 --> 15:37.227
We'll know more
after the test.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.314
If he was just trying to
mess with Cuddy for wasting his time,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.107
this would have stopped as
soon as the patient started

15:42.233 --> 15:43.358
exhibiting actual symptoms.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.111
So the question is,
why is he wasting our time?

15:46.237 --> 15:47.654
Or is he wasting our time?

15:47.780 --> 15:50.824
You think he's got a medical reason for
asking for the guy's credit report?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.200
I don't.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.329
Where were you two
when the guy woke up?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.459
We just stepped out
for a second.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.210
To do what?

16:02.337 --> 16:06.006
To get a coffee.
We'd been up most of the night.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.467
He's just pushing to make sure
we have a complete history.

16:08.593 --> 16:12.137
Obviously we're missing
something or we'd have the answer.

16:12.263 --> 16:15.223
You didn't have any coffee
when you came back.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.810
All right already.
We confess. You caught us.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.812
We snuck into one of
the sleep lab rooms to have sex.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.357
We shouldn't have done it
while we were working and we're sorry.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.359
Now can we move on?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.364
House would do Wilson
before you'd do Chase.

16:30.490 --> 16:34.284
No. You would do House and Wilson
before I'd do Chase.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.995
Now can we
get back to work?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.163
She did me once.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.916
She was stoned!

16:53.137 --> 16:54.805
Biopsy's inconclusive.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.973
I'm gonna do a sialogram while we wait
for results

16:57.100 --> 16:58.058
from the additional blood work.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.226
No hurry.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.019
Probably nothing we can do
at this point anyway.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.562
As long as
the cancer hasn't spread...

17:02.689 --> 17:06.108
He's spitting stink.
You should focus on the living.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.277
I need a prescription.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.154
I just wrote you
a prescription.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.824
For Vicodin.
I need alfuzosin.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.617
No, you don't.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.453
You figured out
where you met your Marine?

17:18.579 --> 17:19.663
What?

17:20.206 --> 17:23.125
Oh, that. Haven't really
thought about it.

17:24.877 --> 17:25.961
I can't pee.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.421
You can't remember him,
can you?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.131
I can't pee.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.799
So stop taking the Vicodin.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.009
I want to pee
and not be in pain.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.720
Why don't you go to sleep?

17:34.846 --> 17:36.179
I don't pee when I'm asleep.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.349
Maybe you'll dream about him
again. Maybe he'll give you an address.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.809
I haven't peed in three days.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.812
I read that REM sleep is
the brain's way of working out problems.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.772
- Very useful.
- Did you hear what I just said?

17:45.898 --> 17:49.067
Yeah. You lied because you want to avoid
talking about your obsession.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.695
- I'm not obsessing.
- Why don't you just ask him?

17:51.821 --> 17:54.322
- I haven't peed in three days!
- You'd be dead.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.408
I'm not counting
intermittent drips.

17:56.534 --> 17:57.701
You'd be in agony.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.287
I passed agony
yesterday around 4:00.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.307
His mother, brother,
uncle and best friend

18:20.433 --> 18:22.809
all confirm he hasn't had
a date in over a year.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.394
Which means it's not an STD.

18:24.812 --> 18:28.064
If you come up with something
medically relevant, page me.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.489
What did you want me
to tell him? The truth?

18:35.740 --> 18:39.242
No. You didn't have
to be so convincing.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.578
Don't worry.
I'll make it up to you.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.457
This is getting
out of control.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.708
Don't pout.

18:47.335 --> 18:51.338
Our patient woke up with an infection
while we were getting our rocks off.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.883
Do you want to stop?

18:55.009 --> 18:55.884
No.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.720
But I don't want to
get caught, either.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.971
You think I do?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.933
You certainly didn't go out of your way
to keep the volume down

19:03.059 --> 19:04.226
when we were
in the sleep lab.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.102
I couldn't help that.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.524
Why would I
want to get caught?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.985
Maybe you want to give House
a reason to be jealous.

19:14.946 --> 19:15.946
I'm over House.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.283
All this is, is uncomplicated sex.
Don't try to make it more than that.

19:20.535 --> 19:23.119
We're not doing it
at work anymore.

19:23.788 --> 19:24.955
Fine.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.550
Wanna go grab some lunch?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.473
I think the pill
is the way to go.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.475
We haven't had
a condom break yet. Thank God.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.521
But it's bound to happen,
especially the way we've been doing it.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.358
- On a bed of nails?
- No.

19:53.484 --> 19:57.445
He's not kinky.
He's just insatiable.

19:57.572 --> 20:00.574
I can barely make it
to any of my morning classes.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.452
- You smoke?
- No way.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.830
Stop it!

20:07.373 --> 20:08.665
Sorry.

20:10.585 --> 20:14.045
Any history of hypertension,
blood clots, strokes?

20:14.171 --> 20:17.132
Nope. Besides my OCD,
I'm fit as a fiddle.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.013
- You have OCD?
- Can't you tell?

20:23.139 --> 20:26.391
Any other compulsions besides drinking
massive amounts of water?

20:26.517 --> 20:28.143
No, that's it.
Thank God.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.478
My therapist says
it could be a lot worse.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.314
You get up in the middle
of the night to drink?

20:32.440 --> 20:34.107
Yeah. Every couple of hours.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.068
Then your therapist
is an idiot.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.446
Unconscious people
don't have OCD.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.740
They can, whoever,
have diabetes insipidus.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.784
That's impossible.
I eat candy all the time.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.413
Different kind of diabetes. This kind is
caused by banged up pituitary.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.540
You're obviously more of
a lover than a fighter.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.958
I'm guessing either
a car accident

20:52.084 --> 20:55.337
or you cracked your
skull on the balance beam.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.548
How'd you know?

20:58.674 --> 21:03.011
Easy. Nice ass. No boobs. And you've got
palms like a longshoreman.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.180
Wait here.
You need a CAT scan.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.432
- Oh, my God...
- Don't worry.

21:07.558 --> 21:11.353
Just means you'll be taking
two hormone supplements instead of one.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.277
Okay, this time
you're gonna feel a little pressure.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.446
We're injecting
the contrast material.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.492
Could you turn up the music?

21:25.618 --> 21:26.868
Sure.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.792
Looks pretty good so far.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.419
Still can't hear it that well.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.217
Can you hear it now?

21:43.094 --> 21:44.219
John?

21:46.180 --> 21:47.097
John!

21:48.391 --> 21:50.517
John, can you hear me?

21:55.481 --> 21:58.191
Still no relief?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.859
I got relief.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.695
I just got no pee.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.406
If the pills didn't work,
you may need a catheter.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.950
You didn't come here
to talk to me about my pee.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.576
What's going on?

22:09.286 --> 22:11.162
He's got cancer all right.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.499
But it's not in his salivary glands.
It's in his brain.

22:15.167 --> 22:19.295
And it's bad.
At least six tumors. Maybe more.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.592
He lost his hearing.
His sight's probably next.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.512
Death is probably next.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.268
No way he could've
grown all these in a week.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.396
They can't be older.
The VA couldn't have missed all these.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.815
Maybe they didn't miss them.
Just mixed them up.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.985
Switched his films with
another patient's by mistake.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.278
Maybe.

22:43.404 --> 22:46.031
It'd mean some poor sap's
getting his melon sliced

22:46.157 --> 22:47.407
at the VA for no reason.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.910
And this poor sergeant's
gonna be dead by the end of the week.

22:51.704 --> 22:52.704
Where've you two been?

22:52.830 --> 22:53.955
Lunch.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.498
Why? What happened?

22:55.624 --> 22:59.794
Wilson's found some fast-growing,
elusive or magic brain tumors.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.421
What did you find?

23:01.547 --> 23:03.798
Nothing.
He's telling the truth.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.175
About what?

23:05.301 --> 23:06.384
About everything.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.053
Where he's lived,
who he's dated.

23:08.179 --> 23:10.305
Besides forgetting to mention
his dad's shin splints,

23:10.431 --> 23:13.725
his granddad's nosebleeds,
and to return a few rented DVDs,

23:13.851 --> 23:15.685
everything he's told us
has checked out.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.937
You have them
researching your dream?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.815
No. I have them
researching my patient.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.776
You had a dream
about a patient?

23:23.319 --> 23:25.528
This poor guy's brain
is riddled with tumors

23:25.654 --> 23:28.364
and you're checking his credit report?

23:31.494 --> 23:33.745
Come on. I need you guys.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.289
- Where are you going?
- To do my job.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.749
He's not your patient.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.959
He is now.
Go home and go to sleep.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.921
Maybe you'll dream a cure
to late-stage brain cancer.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.473
How is he?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.433
He's dead.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.145
- Oh, God.
- At least he will be in a few days.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.857
Question is why.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.152
The only explanation is that
the VA hospital screwed up.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.280
There was definitely
no mix up. I had them recheck.

24:09.406 --> 24:13.785
Yes. Why would a government agency lie
to cover up a mistake

24:13.911 --> 24:15.328
that might have caused
the death of a guy

24:15.454 --> 24:17.497
they'd been trying to kill
for the last two years anyway?

24:17.623 --> 24:19.374
They didn't lie.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.752
Did you just take
two Vicodin?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.921
No. Just an antidepressant.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.258
I was told to take two every time
you walked into the room.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.222
The VA's scan of his brain.
No tumors.

24:35.432 --> 24:39.727
Yes. This is proof positive that someone
didn't have tumors in their brain.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.230
You see that bright spot
below his left orbit?

24:42.356 --> 24:45.692
That is a titanium pin your patient
had inserted 20 years ago.

24:45.818 --> 24:49.028
Unless you think the VA happened to mix
up his scans with someone

24:49.155 --> 24:52.282
who had the exact same pin,
they didn't screw up.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.204
You paged us?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.333
Why didn't you send his urine
to Leicester like I told you?

25:02.459 --> 25:04.669
Because you told me not to.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.380
Why did you choose that moment
to listen to me?

25:07.506 --> 25:10.049
You think depleted uranium might have
something to do with his tumors?

25:10.301 --> 25:12.385
Radiation's the only thing
that will make tumors grow that fast.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.137
High doses of radiation!

25:14.263 --> 25:16.264
Even if he ate
depleted uranium bullets for breakfast,

25:16.390 --> 25:18.057
he still would've been exposed
to less radiation

25:18.184 --> 25:19.642
than we've given him
in the last two days.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.813
Do it anyway.
And you, call his uncle back.

25:23.939 --> 25:27.567
Find out if he ever brought his nephew
to any hospital parties or fundraisers.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.986
No. Not until
you give me a reason.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.781
- Because I'm your boss?
- A rational reason.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.992
Or at least admit
that you don't have one.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.161
I've got a full bladder
and I'm not afraid to use it.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.954
But you are
apparently afraid

25:40.080 --> 25:42.207
of discovering something you can't
rationally explain...

25:42.333 --> 25:43.374
Shut up!

25:44.543 --> 25:46.294
Do what you're told.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.007
Cuddy and Wilson may not have
to listen to me, but you do.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.430
What the hell
was that all about?

25:57.556 --> 25:58.598
I don't care.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.517
Which is why I didn't feel the need to
ask him eight personal questions.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.269
I'm over him.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.857
Just making an observation.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.446
All right.
Ready whenever you are.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.864
I'm ready.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.286
Wait a minute. Zoom in.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.125
I don't see it. You sure you got
the right coordinates?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.711
Yeah. She's in
the right place.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.423
Go 10 millimeters above the AC-PC line
on the Z axis.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.009
Ten mil above AC-PC on Z.

26:37.721 --> 26:38.763
It's not there anymore.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.515
Are you sure you got
the gantry angle right?

26:40.641 --> 26:43.434
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- It's not there.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.480
It disappeared.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.440
Six tumors don't
just disappear.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.359
Unless they were
never there to begin with.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.111
The VA didn't screw up.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.612
Maybe someone else did.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.239
Maybe it was
Dr. Self-Righteous.

26:56.365 --> 26:59.158
I saw the tumors.
There was no mix up.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.577
Maybe there's something wrong with
the portable imager in the OR.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.330
Something that would cause it
to show brain tissue in perfect detail

27:04.456 --> 27:06.624
but completely miss
neoplastic tissue?

27:07.293 --> 27:08.960
Then they were
never tumors to begin with.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.295
I told you I saw...

27:10.421 --> 27:14.882
Oh, you saw something that looked like
tumors. We all did. We were all wrong.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.009
Or maybe he doesn't
have cancer.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.636
Maybe he has a brain infection
that's causing multiple abscesses.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.138
That miraculously healed?

27:20.264 --> 27:21.764
No. They were healed
by the antibiotics

27:21.890 --> 27:23.683
we're giving him for
the vaginosis in his mouth.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.228
If it's an infection, why didn't it show
up in his blood work?

27:27.354 --> 27:29.314
I don't know yet.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.233
Dr. Wilson,
we have a problem.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.485
What did you do?

27:34.611 --> 27:37.071
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

27:37.197 --> 27:38.156
- John...
- What did you guys do?

27:38.282 --> 27:39.574
John! Calm down!
We didn't even operate.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.992
Could this be
a regional effect?

27:41.118 --> 27:42.243
I can't move my legs!

27:42.369 --> 27:43.244
It's not the anesthesia.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.954
John! John!

27:45.080 --> 27:46.497
We're gonna figure out
what's wrong with you.

27:46.623 --> 27:52.795
But first we need to know one thing,
have you ever appeared in any porn?

27:56.759 --> 27:58.968
Chronic fatigue,
sore throats, rashes,

27:59.094 --> 28:02.221
putrid discharge in the mouth,
multiple abscesses in the brain,

28:02.348 --> 28:06.809
hearing loss, and last but not least,
lower limb paralysis.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.811
He's certainly given us
plenty of clues.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.356
It's got to be
some sort of infection.

28:11.482 --> 28:13.483
That's miraculously improving
in his brain

28:13.609 --> 28:15.234
but getting worse
in his ears and legs?

28:15.861 --> 28:17.779
Could be an infection
and cancer.

28:18.072 --> 28:20.448
A neoplastic syndrome
could depress his immune system

28:20.741 --> 28:22.075
and cause the other symptoms.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.494
You're basing this theory
on the negative biopsy,

28:24.620 --> 28:26.120
the lymph nodes
that aren't swollen,

28:26.330 --> 28:28.748
or the tumors that were
never there to begin with?

28:28.874 --> 28:30.583
And what are you gonna base
your theory on?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.710
His favorite restaurants?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.504
I was right.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.799
He's excreting depleted
uranium in his urine.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.802
We should start him on an IV infusion
of isotonic sodium bicarbonate...

28:40.928 --> 28:42.345
It's not depleted uranium.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.638
- You're the one...
- Who asked for the test

28:43.764 --> 28:45.848
when we were thinking cancer.
We no longer are.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.101
Depleted uranium doesn't just
cause cells to mutate.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.519
It can cause
cell death as well.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.229
Not spinal cord cells.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.022
At least not before the dose
is high enough

28:53.148 --> 28:54.816
to kill
all his other cells first.

28:54.942 --> 28:58.486
So you're saying the radioactive uranium
in his urine is irrelevant.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.614
The sun's radioactive.
The earth is radioactive.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.783
This hospital is filled
with radiation.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.744
The issue is not where it is,
but how much there is,

29:06.870 --> 29:09.872
and what damage that amount can cause
in someone's spinal cord.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.750
As I've already
stated quite clearly.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.753
Got it. We're all idiots.
What's your theory?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.672
Give me your keys.
Why?

29:17.798 --> 29:21.300
You ever tried to ride a motorcycle
with a distended bladder?

29:23.512 --> 29:26.848
Keep him on antibiotics, check his
hearing and paralysis every hour.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.891
So you basically
want us to do nothing?

29:29.017 --> 29:30.935
No. I basically
want to do nothing.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.562
I want you to
keep him on antibiotics

29:32.688 --> 29:35.731
and check his hearing
and paralysis every hour.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.025
Wait. You can't
go home now.

29:38.152 --> 29:39.986
Actually, I have to
go home now.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.196
It's two days past my bedtime.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.115
House, he needs your help.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.575
And I need sleep!

29:45.701 --> 29:48.744
Hey, it's the brain's way
of working out problems

29:48.871 --> 29:51.956
that the conscious mind can't solve
during the day, remember?

30:04.845 --> 30:06.304
No. Nothing.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.393
I'm gonna die. Aren't I?

30:17.524 --> 30:18.774
No, we're not.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.861
We should start treatment for
the uranium toxicity like you said.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.738
- But House...
- Isn't here.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.744
If House wanted to be
involved in the case...

30:32.581 --> 30:33.706
...he wanted us to
start this treatment,

30:33.832 --> 30:35.958
he would have told us to do it
the last time you brought it up.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.211
- You have a better idea?
- No.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.171
Then we're going
with Chase's.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.614
Tell him not to
get the lines tangled.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.158
With an infusion this slow
we can't have any kinks in the line.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.118
I went to medical school, too.

32:38.248 --> 32:41.375
Keep your arms on your body.
Above your heart.

32:44.713 --> 32:46.672
I can't feel my stomach!

32:49.801 --> 32:53.054
I don't feel that!
I don't feel anything!

32:53.347 --> 32:54.639
Paralysis is ascending.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.557
If it keeps going
we're gonna need a respirator.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.518
- What? What are you saying?
- Can you breathe?

33:03.732 --> 33:06.150
No. Not yet.

33:51.571 --> 33:54.865
incident on the Garden
State Parkway, southbound at exit 91...

33:54.991 --> 33:57.034
So, where were we?

33:58.286 --> 34:00.496
- You have a nice night?
- No.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.333
The paralysis is ascending.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.877
Last check it was
nearly to his diaphragm.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.004
- Tells us something.
- Means it's getting worse.

34:09.131 --> 34:10.840
Worse is something.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.800
Also it tells us
it's not the uranium.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.262
Did we think it was?

34:16.388 --> 34:20.099
We started him on sodium bicarb to try
to flush the uranium out of his system.

34:20.225 --> 34:23.436
Great. Now the fact that
he's getting worse tells us nothing.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.854
Never thought it was uranium.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.189
For all we know, the uranium treatment
is what's making him...

34:27.315 --> 34:29.442
A sodium bicarb infusion
wouldn't have any effect on...

34:29.568 --> 34:30.943
On what?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.737
Kind of hard to say
what it wouldn't have an effect on

34:32.863 --> 34:34.363
if you've no idea
what's there to affect.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.115
- We had to do something.
- Well, next time,

34:36.241 --> 34:37.908
go with something
that has a chance of working.

34:38.493 --> 34:39.702
Like what?

34:39.828 --> 34:41.871
You come up with some brilliant idea
while you're warm and cozy

34:41.997 --> 34:43.748
- in your bed at home?
- We need more information.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.333
How much more information
could you possibly want?

34:46.460 --> 34:49.545
We have a medical history going all the
way back to his great grandparents.

34:49.671 --> 34:52.423
- A non-medical history going...
- It's not enough.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.008
It's all we're gonna get.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.346
Wanna bet?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.771
Who approved
a sodium bicarb infusion?

35:07.397 --> 35:09.148
Don't look at me.
I was home in bed.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.400
- What's wrong?
- He's unconscious.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.862
His skin has lost all color and his BP
and hematocrit are plunging.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.322
He was only on
the sodium bicarb...

35:16.448 --> 35:17.281
He's bleeding out.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.783
He can't be bleeding out.
There's no blood in the bed.

35:19.159 --> 35:20.284
Fine. He's bleeding in.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.036
There's no sign of bruising
or internal hemorrhaging.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.871
The paralysis
must've reached his diaphragm.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.331
He's not able to
oxygenate his blood.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.375
He's not able to oxygenate his blood
because he doesn't have any left.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.668
There's no evidence.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.045
The only thing
that would explain...

35:31.171 --> 35:32.004
There's no reason
for blood loss.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.422
There has to be a reason!

35:33.548 --> 35:36.175
He needs a transfusion.
Get me four units of O-negative, stat.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.219
Let's elevate his feet.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.013
He doesn't need a transfusion.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.641
Nobody asked you.
In fact, why are you even here?

35:44.059 --> 35:46.727
- Because obviously you need my help.
- Get out.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.688
House, his blood obviously
didn't just vanish into...

35:52.359 --> 35:54.193
What the hell is this?

35:55.070 --> 35:56.320
Somebody must have
spilled something.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.114
Somebody else should be getting me four
units of O-negative, stat.

35:59.241 --> 36:01.116
What the hell is that?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.623
It's a urine catheter
collection bag with a rip in it.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.708
What the hell's
it look like?

36:14.923 --> 36:15.756
What?

36:17.801 --> 36:20.261
It's just urine. It's sterile.

36:21.054 --> 36:24.265
No one's getting me blood!
Why isn't anybody getting me blood?

36:24.516 --> 36:25.474
You're bleeding.

36:27.936 --> 36:29.728
House, are you all right?

36:32.816 --> 36:34.900
Why are you even here?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.570
I'm always here.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.239
No, you're not.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.326
There's a reason.
There has to be.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.695
incident on
the Garden State Parkway...

37:19.821 --> 37:21.780
So, where were we?

37:23.408 --> 37:24.575
Have a nice night?

37:25.118 --> 37:26.410
Yes, I did. Thank you.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.412
I'm guessing better
than our patient.

37:28.538 --> 37:31.916
Probably due to his BP
and hematocrit plunging.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.751
How'd you know?

37:42.302 --> 37:45.179
The answer was staring
right at us the whole time.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.681
As plain as
the nose on our faces.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.141
And the nose on his face.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.143
What's going on?
What did he say?

37:51.269 --> 37:53.854
No hairs and
cauterization scars.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.065
Which means?

37:56.816 --> 37:59.985
- He had it cauterized.
- How could you know that?

38:00.111 --> 38:00.986
Because it makes sense.

38:01.488 --> 38:04.281
Undoubtedly done to stop
the same childhood nosebleeds

38:04.407 --> 38:05.866
that plagued
his grandfather.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.534
Undoubtedly because they were both born

38:07.661 --> 38:09.828
with hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia.

38:10.121 --> 38:10.955
What's he saying?

38:11.081 --> 38:14.291
I'm saying you have a genetic disease
that's destroying your capillaries.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.877
That no one in his family's
ever been diagnosed with before?

38:17.003 --> 38:19.505
Not surprising,
since the most common initial symptoms,

38:19.631 --> 38:21.465
skin rashes and nosebleeds
are often written off

38:21.675 --> 38:24.426
as the result of
minor trauma or dry weather.

38:24.552 --> 38:28.180
But they can also be the result of his
arteries and veins merging together.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.140
He obviously has AVMs.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.850
AVM near the spine
caused the paralysis.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.020
AVM in his lungs prevented
his blood from being filtered.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.481
Dirty blood caused
the joint pain, fatigue,

38:37.607 --> 38:39.650
and the infections
in his mouth and brain.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.403
Nothing that a few surgeries
won't clear up.

38:42.904 --> 38:45.364
Get MR angiograms
of the aforementioned.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.783
The Marines weren't hiding
anything. He was.

38:48.118 --> 38:51.578
Or at least he forgot
to mention his bloody tissue issue.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.916
What's going on?
What did he say?

39:01.131 --> 39:04.091
Well, looks like solving the case
solved your other problem.

39:04.217 --> 39:08.012
There is no medicine
like happiness. Except maybe laughter.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.306
Or rubber tubes
shoved up your urethra.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.475
You cathed yourself?

39:13.601 --> 39:17.771
It's actually not that bad after the
first, I don't know, 9 or 10 inches.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.649
The cath relieved the spasm.
I'm good as new.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.651
Of course.
Just a minor spasm in a muscle

39:22.777 --> 39:25.029
you've been using multiple times a day

39:25.155 --> 39:27.948
without any problems
for the past 45 years.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.074
Not a major side effect

39:29.200 --> 39:32.953
caused by the overuse of a particular
narcotic painkiller.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.872
Yeah.
That was my thought, too.

39:34.998 --> 39:39.001
So, no reason to think about
cutting back on your use

39:39.127 --> 39:40.210
of that particular pill.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.754
Thank God!

39:42.005 --> 39:43.589
Actually, it was
the triple dose of the good stuff

39:43.715 --> 39:47.509
that allowed me to finally get some
sleep and solve the case.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.970
Pills made all my dreams
come true.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.140
You really got the answer
in your sleep?

39:53.266 --> 39:56.852
I got one in my sleep.
The other one I got in the shower.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.235
I've been thinking about you.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.113
You lied.

40:08.615 --> 40:09.865
I didn't lie.

40:09.991 --> 40:13.744
I simply chose not to share
completely irrelevant facts.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.163
Like the fact that you lied.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.916
No wonder I couldn't
place his face.

40:19.042 --> 40:21.251
You were practically
swallowing it on the dance floor.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.711
I was not.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.254
Talk about the cool uncle.

40:24.380 --> 40:27.841
He donates the money
and the nephew gets the write-off.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.302
And of course, by write-off,
I mean he gets to put your ankles...

40:30.428 --> 40:34.348
This is exactly why I didn't mention
our one date over two years ago.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.601
Because of my T-shirt.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.937
Because you are
an obnoxious ass.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.272
Because you would have
spent the whole time...

40:42.398 --> 40:43.357
That's very smart.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.693
'Cause this way I spent the whole time
completely focused on the patient.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.028
How did you even
remember him?

40:48.154 --> 40:49.988
We were only at that party
for like 10 minutes!

40:50.115 --> 40:51.949
Is this a new health plan?

40:52.075 --> 40:55.494
Service the Dean of Medicine, you get
free health care for a year?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.081
Why are you smiling?

40:59.749 --> 41:02.876
You remembered him
because he made out with me.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.921
I'm good with faces.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.841
So this plan,
is it open to anyone? Is there a co-pay?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.259
You're lousy with faces.

41:10.385 --> 41:13.387
Don't make this about me.
This is your humiliation.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.097
So how much for
private room coverage?

41:16.474 --> 41:17.558
Get over me.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.853
Give me a break.
You hired me...

41:20.979 --> 41:23.480
'Cause you're a good doctor who couldn't
get himself hired at a blood bank,

41:23.606 --> 41:25.065
so I got you cheap.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.817
You gave me everything I asked for

41:26.943 --> 41:28.819
because one night I gave you
everything...

41:28.945 --> 41:31.947
Stop staring at my ass
when you think I'm not looking,

41:32.073 --> 41:34.658
showing up at restaurants
where I happen to be on a date,

41:35.076 --> 41:37.494
and fantasizing about me
in the shower.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.080
That ship sailed
long ago, House.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.124
Get over it.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.586
If you're still referring
to your ass,

41:45.712 --> 41:49.756
I think that supertanker sailed would be
the more precise metaphor.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.042
Sorry.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.878
Just looking for
an extra-large trashcan.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.845
Since when does
he clean anything up?
