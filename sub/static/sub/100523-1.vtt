What are you doing?

01:58.750 --> 01:59.833
Violet Markey?

02:02.375 --> 02:03.458
Oh, my God.

02:10.583 --> 02:11.583
Please go.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.250
- Well, I don't think that's very...
- Just go!

02:31.291 --> 02:32.625
What are you doing?

02:33.041 --> 02:34.166
I asked you first.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.666
This is higher than I thought.

02:44.666 --> 02:45.666
Hey.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.708
Hey, look.

02:48.625 --> 02:49.791
Look what I can do.

02:51.791 --> 02:53.541
Stop. Stop!

03:05.166 --> 03:06.166
Hey, Violet.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.875
Hey. Do you have plans this weekend?
My parents are gonna be out of town.

04:07.958 --> 04:10.375
I was thinking about having a party
or something.

04:16.541 --> 04:17.541
Violet?

04:18.791 --> 04:19.791
You OK?

04:23.833 --> 04:25.250
How's everything going?

04:26.208 --> 04:27.916
"Everything" is a really big word.

04:28.916 --> 04:31.375
- Let's start with...
- Do you mean physically?

04:31.458 --> 04:34.166
Emotionally?
Those both could encompass "everything."

04:34.250 --> 04:36.083
Or is "everything" encompassed
by both things?

04:36.166 --> 04:37.916
Are you feeling overwhelmed by anything?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.800
If "everything" is encompassed
by both things,

04:39.833 --> 04:42.153
are they a part of our reality,
or are they somewhere else?

04:42.208 --> 04:43.666
This isn't funny, Theodore.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.416
Finch.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.791
I need you
to take these meetings seriously.

04:49.875 --> 04:50.875
I get it.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.750
OK, do you "get"
that you're on probation,

04:54.791 --> 04:56.541
and in danger of not graduating?

04:58.750 --> 05:01.333
You've already missed
two weeks of school this year.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, um...

05:04.416 --> 05:06.125
- my grandma...
- Stop one second.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.916
I just wanna clarify real quickly.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.125
Is this the grandma who's died four times
over the past three years?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.333
Five times, actually.

05:14.083 --> 05:15.166
This is the fifth.

05:18.625 --> 05:19.875
She's our miracle.

05:21.750 --> 05:25.000
I really wanna help you,
but you've gotta take this seriously.

05:26.291 --> 05:30.541
I mean, you agreed to these terms,
these weekly counseling sessions,

05:30.625 --> 05:33.375
maintaining a B-average,
extracurricular participation.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.500
And I am loving pottery.

05:36.125 --> 05:37.125
Come on, man.

05:37.583 --> 05:38.708
Look, I get it.

05:38.791 --> 05:40.916
If I screw anything up, I'm out.

05:41.666 --> 05:43.541
We're not askin' a lot of you, Finch.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.375
You just need to show up.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.480
My parents are pissed
because I missed early admissions,

05:50.541 --> 05:52.125
but it's not like that matters, anyway.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.125
I mean, I know I'm gonna get in.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.916
Did you apply anywhere yet?

05:59.208 --> 06:01.083
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.875
So, you going to Amanda's party?

06:05.333 --> 06:06.375
It'll be fun.

06:07.125 --> 06:08.208
So I've heard.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.625
It couldn't hurt
to have a little fun, right?

06:11.208 --> 06:15.125
Yo, do you think it'd be weird
if I named my kid after a famous person?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.666
Like, if I named him Danny DeVito Donahue,

06:18.750 --> 06:21.416
do you...
do you think he'd be mad about it?

06:22.375 --> 06:23.875
Is "DeVito" the middle name?

06:24.458 --> 06:25.458
Yeah.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.875
Follow-up question:
how high are you right now?

06:29.500 --> 06:33.250
On the scale,
I'd probably say very... this way.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.208
- On the scale...
- Yeah?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.458
What are you looking at?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.250
Just admiring the social norms
of teenage angst.

06:42.833 --> 06:45.041
- Are you looking at Violet Markey?
- Yep.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.250
Her, um...

06:48.250 --> 06:49.458
her sister died, right?

06:50.458 --> 06:51.333
Yeah, dude.

06:51.416 --> 06:52.416
Hm.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.625
Why ask about her all of a sudden?

06:54.708 --> 06:56.267
I'm intrigued.
A guy can't be intrigued?

06:56.291 --> 06:59.541
Well, a guy can be intrigued.
You being intrigued is weird.

07:00.125 --> 07:03.083
- Definitely weird.
- No, I don't think it's weird.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.333
I wouldn't say "weird."

07:04.416 --> 07:06.500
Wait, if you don't think you're weird,
well...

07:07.875 --> 07:10.333
- Yeah, that's true. Very true.
- She has a point.

07:19.583 --> 07:22.458
- Your guidance counselor called.
- Embryo?

07:22.541 --> 07:23.541
What?

07:25.541 --> 07:29.458
His name's Embry. I call him Embryo.
It's the little things, Kate.

07:29.541 --> 07:31.625
Did you do something
I should be worried about?

07:31.708 --> 07:34.375
I'm genuinely offended
by that supposition.

07:34.916 --> 07:36.250
- Finch.
- No.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.500
It's fine. I'll deal with it.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.750
- I hate when you say that.
- Why?

07:40.833 --> 07:44.083
Because what you really mean is
that I'm gonna have to deal with it.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.708
Did you cut class again?

07:47.791 --> 07:49.375
No! For fuck's sake,

07:49.458 --> 07:52.208
just go hang out with Tina
or whatever it is you do.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.291
I'm fine.

07:54.083 --> 07:57.333
OK. I'm gonna be home late.
There's food in the fridge.

07:57.416 --> 07:59.125
- Mm-hmm.
- Real food, Finch.

07:59.833 --> 08:00.708
Where's Mom?

08:00.791 --> 08:03.041
She had to go to Chicago for business.
Remember?

08:03.125 --> 08:05.291
- Oh, yeah, right. Cool.
- Love you.

08:05.583 --> 08:06.583
Hey.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.833
- Love you.
- Love you.

08:13.541 --> 08:15.375
No more cheese, Finch!

08:28.208 --> 08:29.666
I'm gonna get the dessert.

08:35.625 --> 08:38.791
Your mother and I know
that today couldn't have been easy.

08:39.707 --> 08:41.832
And it wasn't easy for us either.

08:46.541 --> 08:48.958
If you need to talk about it...

08:51.625 --> 08:53.416
I thought this would be nice.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.625
I've been making it for 19 years.

11:11.958 --> 11:13.666
As some of you
will be graduating

11:13.750 --> 11:15.416
and leaving us at the end of the year,

11:15.500 --> 11:19.208
I feel an obligation to make sure
you see the wondrous sights of Indiana

11:19.291 --> 11:20.375
while you can.

11:20.458 --> 11:23.458
To wander them, if you will.

11:24.458 --> 11:28.791
For your class project, you must report
on two or more wonders of Indiana.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.500
You will write about them,

11:30.583 --> 11:33.750
explain their significance
to you and to Indiana,

11:33.833 --> 11:35.458
and why you chose to visit them.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.250
I want you to take time
on this assignment.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.500
Be thoughtful.

11:42.458 --> 11:43.458
OK.

11:44.958 --> 11:45.958
What just happened?

11:46.750 --> 11:47.958
That was so weird.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.521
- What?
- All right, settle.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.625
Violet, are you OK?

11:51.708 --> 11:54.541
All right, let's take our seats.
Let's focus up.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.916
If you're done, Mr. Finch?

11:57.000 --> 12:01.041
Yes, I am done, and can I just say you
are doing a fine job teaching this class.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.125
My young brain is plump with knowledge.

12:03.916 --> 12:06.208
- Thank you, Mr. Finch.
- You're welcome.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.166
As I was saying,

12:08.250 --> 12:11.958
you'll be taking photos,
doing some drawings, capturing detail.

12:12.041 --> 12:14.750
You will be doing this in teams of two.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.458
Can we choose our partners?

12:17.875 --> 12:19.000
Yes, Mr. Finch.

12:21.958 --> 12:22.958
Hey.

12:25.916 --> 12:26.916
So, um...

12:27.958 --> 12:31.500
do you think that there's such a thing
as a perfect day?

12:32.791 --> 12:34.875
I'm the last person you should be asking.

12:59.708 --> 13:01.375
<i>For my geography class,</i>

13:01.458 --> 13:05.125
this teacher wants us to do this project
with a partner,

13:05.208 --> 13:07.291
and I just don't wanna do it.

13:07.708 --> 13:10.125
Well, did you ask
for an alternate project?

13:10.875 --> 13:12.750
Yeah, he just... he wouldn't listen.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.303
Well, maybe it's time
to get back out there.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.333
That's the same thing he said.

13:19.958 --> 13:21.166
I know it's hard.

13:22.666 --> 13:25.333
- But you just don't go out anymore.
- That's not true.

13:25.416 --> 13:27.791
When's the last time you hung out
with your friends?

13:29.250 --> 13:32.583
I think it would be really good
if you'd spend some time with them.

13:34.166 --> 13:37.625
So, if I hung out with my friends,
you'd get me outta this assignment?

13:41.333 --> 13:44.416
<i>♪ Speedy, speedy, slow down time

13:44.500 --> 13:47.166

<i>♪ Sweaty, sweaty, wonder why

13:52.458 --> 13:53.458
Violet!

13:55.791 --> 13:58.083
- You came.
- I did.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:00.416 --> 14:03.166
- I'm gonna get a drink. Do you want one?
- I'm good.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.625
Come on, babe.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.166
OK.

14:47.041 --> 14:47.875
Yeah...

14:58.416 --> 14:59.500
Hey.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.458
That's a heavy pour.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.708
You know me. I love to rage.

15:04.791 --> 15:07.875
So, you wanna go out back?
Talk a little?

15:10.291 --> 15:12.708
I think I'm gonna leave pretty soon,
actually.

15:13.375 --> 15:16.125
Really? But... I mean, I just got here.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.500
It's just all a little much, you know?

15:21.208 --> 15:23.458
How much longer
are you gonna act like this?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.625
It's been months.
When are you gonna just...

15:32.750 --> 15:33.750
Nice.

15:35.666 --> 15:38.416
Violet, you know
I didn't mean it like that. Just...

15:57.708 --> 16:01.416
<i>Violet Markey,
if you're seeing this, you're still alive.</i>

16:01.500 --> 16:02.708
<i>Please call to confirm.</i>

Take it down now.

16:36.708 --> 16:41.000
The video will self-destruct
in three, two...

16:42.291 --> 16:43.291
<i>...please refresh.</i>

16:46.541 --> 16:47.708
Why would you do that?

16:48.125 --> 16:49.750
I wanna talk about the bridge.

16:53.291 --> 16:57.208
<i>"I feel we can't go through
another of those terrible times."</i>

17:00.416 --> 17:03.166
One morning barely qualifies
as a terrible time.

17:03.541 --> 17:04.833
It's a quote.

17:05.750 --> 17:06.833
Virginia Woolf.

17:08.790 --> 17:09.790
OK.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.208
Can I come over?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.333
<i>Now?</i>

17:15.290 --> 17:16.375
Yeah.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.375
So...

17:29.333 --> 17:31.000
I Googled you.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.333
You <i>Googled </i> me?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.625
Yeah, what's with that...

17:40.250 --> 17:43.125
the website that you have
with your sister?

17:44.958 --> 17:45.958
Had.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.541
I read some of your stuff.
It's really good.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.125
I don't write anymore.

17:58.583 --> 18:01.791
So, you moved here from California.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.333
How was that?

18:06.666 --> 18:08.166
California to Indiana?

18:09.125 --> 18:10.416
Must've been different.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.125
Yeah.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.125
I didn't know that it happened there.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.750
At the bridge.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.708
I'm not, you know...

18:35.583 --> 18:36.916
Suicidal?

18:37.791 --> 18:38.791
You can say it.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.500
Well, I'm not.

18:42.458 --> 18:45.208
Whatever you are, I saved your life.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.250
No, you didn't.

18:50.666 --> 18:52.833
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.625
Mm... kinda looked like somethin'.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.708
What do you want from me?

19:00.875 --> 19:03.875
I was just thinkin' that
we should be partners.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.041
For the wandering project.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.083
I think it would be good for you
to get out.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.541
Maybe I don't wanna get out.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.125
Maybe I'm sick of people.

19:17.041 --> 19:18.583
Yeah, people are stupid.

19:19.416 --> 19:24.416
But the tiniest few
might actually mean well.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.375
Why do you wanna do this with me, anyway?

19:29.833 --> 19:32.625
Because there are places
that need to be seen.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.583
Maybe even the smallest of places

19:36.250 --> 19:37.750
can mean something.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.291
At the very least,

19:40.041 --> 19:42.166
maybe they can mean something to us.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.333
Not an "us."

19:44.666 --> 19:48.625
Maybe they can mean something
to you and me.

19:48.708 --> 19:51.166
Jesus, they call <i>me </i> anti-social.

19:51.708 --> 19:54.291
Two wanders. That's all.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.583
We can do more if you end up loving it.

19:57.666 --> 19:58.666
I won't.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.750
You might.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.541
No, I won't.

20:07.583 --> 20:10.875
Oh, I found another quote for you.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.291
"I feel a thousand capacities
spring up in me."

20:18.458 --> 20:21.750
<i>The Waves. </i> It's from <i>The Waves.</i>

20:23.083 --> 20:26.708
You've got at least
a thousand capacities in you.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.083
Even if you don't think so.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.250
You can keep that one.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.250
You know people call you
"The Freak," right?

20:49.291 --> 20:50.291
Yeah.

20:51.416 --> 20:55.916
Sometimes I say and do things
without thinking, and...

20:57.041 --> 21:00.083
people don't like that,
people like labels.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.583
They like putting you in a box.

21:01.666 --> 21:04.291
They want you to be
who they want you to be.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.250
People don't like messy.

21:10.583 --> 21:11.583
Or different.

21:16.333 --> 21:19.208
My parents are calling Hudson
to get me outta the project,

21:19.291 --> 21:21.166
so you need to find another partner.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.416
OK.

21:29.625 --> 21:32.208
Good night, Violet Markey.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.291
Good night...

21:36.041 --> 21:37.333
Theodore Finch.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.875
Hey. Hey!

22:06.416 --> 22:07.416
Violet.

22:08.958 --> 22:10.125
Hey, where you going?

22:11.083 --> 22:12.083
Home.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.083
How'd it go with Hudson?

22:15.833 --> 22:16.833
Not great.

22:17.458 --> 22:18.458
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.541
He feels pretty strongly
about participation.

22:28.416 --> 22:29.416
OK...

22:32.166 --> 22:33.541
but no cars.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.125
Come again?

22:36.208 --> 22:37.583
If you wanna do this with me,

22:37.666 --> 22:40.958
you have to figure out another way
because I'm not getting in a car.

23:09.041 --> 23:10.500
<i>Can I ask you a question?</i>

23:11.791 --> 23:14.000
<i>Where would you go
if you could go anywhere?</i>

23:15.916 --> 23:19.041
- <i>California.
- But you've already been there.</i>

23:20.791 --> 23:21.791
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:22.416 --> 23:24.791
<i>It's warm and it never snows.</i>

23:26.791 --> 23:30.000
<i>Don't you wanna know where I'd go
if I could go anywhere?</i>

23:31.333 --> 23:34.083
<i>Where would you go
if you could go anywhere?</i>

23:34.791 --> 23:38.333
<i>I'd go to a place
no one's ever been before.</i>

23:38.958 --> 23:40.208
<i>Undiscovered.</i>

23:40.291 --> 23:41.291
<i>Untouched.</i>

23:42.375 --> 23:44.583
<i>You could come... if you want.</i>

23:56.500 --> 23:57.541
That's it?

24:04.083 --> 24:05.583
Get on up here, Ultraviolet.

24:05.666 --> 24:06.666
No.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.125
Come on.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.958
Come on. The view is incredible.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.333
Come on.

24:28.541 --> 24:30.833
So, what do we think?

24:31.666 --> 24:33.500
The highest point in Indiana.

24:35.583 --> 24:39.666
I think if I were here for literally any
other reason than why you and I are here,

24:39.750 --> 24:40.833
I'd be pissed.

24:42.166 --> 24:45.083
Oh, wow. Is that a sense of humor
you're hiding in there?

24:45.166 --> 24:46.375
Hm.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.750
This is the lamest thing
I think I've ever seen.

25:03.708 --> 25:06.750
It's OK, you know?
You're not going to hell for laughing.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.041
It's pretty lame.

25:16.791 --> 25:18.416
It was my sister's birthday.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.791
She would've been 19.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.958
That's why I was at the bridge.

25:33.791 --> 25:34.958
Why were you there?

25:38.750 --> 25:39.916
I like to run.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.833
It's pretty early to run.

25:44.916 --> 25:45.916
Yeah.

25:50.916 --> 25:51.916
Let's jump.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.333
You with me?

25:59.291 --> 26:00.458
All right, on three.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.125
You gotta get ready.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.583
One... there it is,

26:04.666 --> 26:05.666
two,

26:06.416 --> 26:07.416
three.

26:10.708 --> 26:11.875
Wow.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.500
All right.

26:15.625 --> 26:18.125
These are the things we leave behind.

26:18.875 --> 26:19.875
Pick one.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.083
Not that one.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.958
Yeah. That's a good choice.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.166
- What?
- You didn't know?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.083
This is a motherfucking staring contest.

26:49.416 --> 26:50.583
You can't be serious.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.833
Look at my face. I'm really serious.

26:54.791 --> 26:55.791
Fine.

26:56.708 --> 26:58.000
I'm very competitive.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.083
Me too.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.083
I'm staying over at Tina's tonight.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.291
OK.

27:50.958 --> 27:51.958
"OK"?

27:53.208 --> 27:54.208
Yeah.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.125
Usually, that incites a diatribe

27:58.208 --> 28:00.708
- about how Tina's an asshole...
- "Diatribe." Good word.

28:00.791 --> 28:02.833
...and how I shouldn't spend
so much time with her.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.083
Yeah, well, it appears that
my many rantings on this topic

28:07.166 --> 28:10.083
have stuck with you,
and I don't have to preach anymore.

28:10.791 --> 28:12.041
What's going on with you?

28:13.875 --> 28:14.875
Nothing.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.375
You seem, like...

28:18.833 --> 28:19.833
goofy.

28:23.750 --> 28:24.916
You're goofy.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.416
<i>"I feel we can't go through
another of those terrible times."</i>

29:24.250 --> 29:27.083
<i>"Why are women
so much more interesting to men</i>

29:27.166 --> 29:28.500
<i>than men are to women?"</i>

29:43.208 --> 29:47.083
<i>"My own brain is, to me,
the most unaccountable of machinery,</i>

29:47.166 --> 29:50.916
<i>always buzzing, humming,
soaring, roaring, diving,</i>

29:51.000 --> 29:52.333
<i>and then buried in mud.</i>

29:53.083 --> 29:54.250
<i>And why?</i>

29:54.333 --> 29:55.958
<i>What's this passion for?"</i>

30:08.625 --> 30:11.291
<i>"If you do not tell the truth
about yourself,</i>

30:11.625 --> 30:14.166
<i>you cannot tell it about other people."</i>

33:34.083 --> 33:35.583
Tell me about Eleanor.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.833
She was bossy... like you.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.333
I like her already.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.708
She hated reading.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.625
She only liked this Italian poet,

33:59.875 --> 34:01.333
Cesare Pavese.

34:02.583 --> 34:07.166
He said, "We do not remember days,
we remember moments."

34:10.250 --> 34:12.041
Any time I was having a bad day,

34:13.583 --> 34:15.208
she always said that.

34:15.291 --> 34:17.500
Like it was supposed to fix something.

34:18.625 --> 34:19.625
Did it?

34:21.750 --> 34:22.750
Yeah.

34:23.666 --> 34:24.666
It did.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.666
What else?

34:34.291 --> 34:35.750
She was my best friend.

34:42.083 --> 34:43.375
"Eleanor Markey.

34:44.625 --> 34:45.708
Sister...

34:47.250 --> 34:48.250
best friend."

34:52.250 --> 34:53.625
That's a pretty good epitaph.

34:57.625 --> 34:58.750
What would yours be?

35:02.958 --> 35:04.166
"Violet Markey.

35:06.583 --> 35:07.583
I was here."

35:11.916 --> 35:14.708
Yeah, I'm gonna have to steal that one
from you.

35:23.625 --> 35:25.000
You making pancakes?

35:25.791 --> 35:26.916
Yeah.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.708
- Blueberry pancakes?
- Yup.

35:30.583 --> 35:31.875
Lookin' pretty good.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.392
- Wanna flip 'em?
- Yeah, are they ready?

35:35.416 --> 35:37.708
- Yeah. Well, give it a...
- Almost ready.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.458
- These look pretty good.
- Yeah.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.333
OK.

35:44.666 --> 35:46.892
There we go. That one's good.

35:46.916 --> 35:49.197
Yeah, there you go. Golden brown

35:56.583 --> 35:58.375
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:58.458 --> 35:59.833
Where've you been?

36:00.708 --> 36:03.375
You're not mad that
I'm doing that project with Roamer, right?

36:03.833 --> 36:04.666
No.

36:04.750 --> 36:06.875
OK, cool.
'Cause it's, like, it's not a thing.

36:06.958 --> 36:09.083
No, it's fine. I'm doing it with Finch.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.625
With Finch?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah.

36:13.708 --> 36:16.625
You know that he's, like, kinda dangerous?

36:17.708 --> 36:18.916
No, he's not.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.541
He freaked out last year
and threw a chair at Roamer,

36:22.625 --> 36:24.375
like, in the middle of class.

36:25.666 --> 36:26.666
He did?

36:27.583 --> 36:31.416
Yeah, like, Roamer was fine,
but he's seriously fucked up.

36:43.958 --> 36:49.750
So, I was thinking we should check out
the Shoe Tree or the abandoned drive-in,

36:49.833 --> 36:52.125
depending on whatever you're feeling.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.291
What is this?

36:55.708 --> 36:57.916
That's a reminder that sooner or later,

36:58.291 --> 37:00.691
you're gonna have to get back
into the world all by yourself.

37:01.083 --> 37:02.875
But I'm happy pushing you for now.

37:04.958 --> 37:08.041
Well, I said
I was only gonna do two, so...

37:12.166 --> 37:14.083
I prefer Private Violet to...

37:14.875 --> 37:15.875
Public Violet.

37:15.958 --> 37:17.250
Can you put her on?

37:17.333 --> 37:18.333
I'll wait.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.333
Maybe you should
give her some space.

37:22.625 --> 37:25.125
Nice sweater. What's that, a cotton blend?

37:26.875 --> 37:30.458
People think this whole "freak" thing
is an act. I know it's real.

37:33.958 --> 37:35.000
Of course it is.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.208
How are things?

37:44.041 --> 37:46.625
Just your average teenage melodrama.

37:47.625 --> 37:49.708
Come on. You gotta give me more than that.

37:51.750 --> 37:53.875
People are always telling me what I am.

37:54.458 --> 37:55.458
A freak.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.375
I get it.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.333
Doesn't mean
it doesn't piss me off sometimes.

38:00.416 --> 38:02.250
Well, that must be hard.

38:08.916 --> 38:09.916
Come on, man.

38:10.458 --> 38:12.458
Come on. Help me out here.
Come on. Help me out.

38:18.583 --> 38:20.458
Maybe if...

38:21.333 --> 38:22.958
you got a fainting couch,

38:23.916 --> 38:25.625
you could put it right over there.

38:25.708 --> 38:28.625
It would really give me the <i>mise en scène</i>
that I was looking for.

38:29.291 --> 38:30.625
Tie the whole room together.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.250
Did you look into that support group
I told you to check out?

38:33.333 --> 38:35.708
I might've lost the info on that one.

38:35.791 --> 38:38.208
Come on, Theodore. It's a small ask, man.

38:39.291 --> 38:43.666
All right. It's Mondays
after school at First Congregational.

38:44.125 --> 38:46.416
- It's called Fresh Approach...
- Ooh!

38:46.500 --> 38:48.041
...and it is confidential,

38:48.458 --> 38:52.291
so you can say whatever you want
about anything that's bothering you.

38:53.250 --> 38:56.875
It is a safe space, Finch.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.833
I want you to think about it.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.000
What now? Now what are we doing? What?

39:07.083 --> 39:08.375
What's happenin'?

39:08.458 --> 39:09.500
Is this a knock-off?

39:09.583 --> 39:10.916
The Post-it?

39:11.541 --> 39:13.625
- This is off-brand.

Hey.

40:32.833 --> 40:34.250
Did you sleep out here?

40:35.750 --> 40:36.750
Yeah.

40:40.458 --> 40:43.250
I know you said that you were done,

40:43.875 --> 40:45.916
but what if I told you

40:46.000 --> 40:49.041
that I found the best wander
in the state of Indiana,

40:49.125 --> 40:51.208
possibly the world, but...

40:53.125 --> 40:54.500
it was 160 miles away?

40:55.375 --> 40:58.291
I'd say have fun,
and I can't wait to hear all about it.

40:58.833 --> 41:01.750
Come on! Just give it a chance.

41:01.833 --> 41:03.791
- At least sit inside.
- No, Finch.

41:03.875 --> 41:05.208
I'm not getting in a car!

41:05.291 --> 41:07.291
Look, here. I'll take the keys, and...

41:10.666 --> 41:14.083
I swear not to drive faster
than 30 miles per hour through town

41:14.166 --> 41:15.666
or 50 on the interstate.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.833
If at any time you wanna stop, we stop.

41:19.666 --> 41:21.625
You can't keep pushing people.

41:21.708 --> 41:25.833
You don't listen. We did it.
The project is over. This is over.

41:26.291 --> 41:28.791
You know this isn't
about a class assignment.

41:29.541 --> 41:33.208
This is about you being holed up
in your room or on your stupid bike,

41:33.291 --> 41:35.416
always circling
the same three-mile radius.

41:35.500 --> 41:38.416
And God forbid anyone risk upsetting
"Poor Violet," but...

41:39.500 --> 41:40.780
they're wrong.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.500
Violet.

41:43.916 --> 41:45.250
Is everything OK out here?

41:45.333 --> 41:46.666
- Fine.
- Hey.

41:46.750 --> 41:51.041
Sorry. Hey. Hi, I'm Theodore Finch.
Pleasure to meet you both.

41:51.125 --> 41:54.500
- Little early, don't you think, Theodore?
- Yes. Yes, it is early.

41:54.583 --> 41:56.000
That is a fair observation.

41:56.083 --> 41:58.916
But you see, I'm your daughter's partner
for the school project,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.375
and we really need to get to this place.

42:03.291 --> 42:05.416
Basically, I need her to get into the car.

42:05.500 --> 42:06.625
That car.

42:07.625 --> 42:10.208
That is extremely safe, insured,

42:10.791 --> 42:14.208
with an experienced driver who hasn't
gotten so much as a speeding ticket.

42:14.291 --> 42:15.708
This is for a school project?

42:16.125 --> 42:17.958
Yes, sir. We're partners.

42:19.958 --> 42:23.583
Well, Theodore, I think
it's Violet's decision to make, but...

42:25.083 --> 42:26.583
maybe not a bad idea.

42:39.666 --> 42:41.375
You think she's coming back?

42:41.458 --> 42:44.083
Hey, your guess is as good as ours.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.500
Oh.

42:57.291 --> 42:58.541
No, wait. No.

43:02.250 --> 43:05.708
OK. If I were keys, where would I hide?

43:15.375 --> 43:16.833
How are we doin' over there?

43:16.916 --> 43:17.916
Fine.

43:18.416 --> 43:19.333
You sure?

43:19.416 --> 43:21.750
Just stop asking me.
You're making it worse.

43:22.541 --> 43:23.958
Talk about something else.

43:24.791 --> 43:26.875
Usually, that is my forte.

43:26.958 --> 43:29.125
But right now, I got nothin'.

43:33.083 --> 43:35.541
♪ <i>...build this thing together ♪</i>

43:49.916 --> 43:51.166
It's a good song.

44:43.500 --> 44:46.083
I don't remember how fast we were going.

44:46.375 --> 44:48.250
It didn't seem fast.

44:55.666 --> 44:57.083
Then we were sliding...

45:03.708 --> 45:06.291
and Eleanor was saying, "I can't hold on."

45:10.666 --> 45:13.291
And then the car slammed into the bridge.

45:24.208 --> 45:25.541
I just remember the...

45:25.625 --> 45:27.625
the glass hitting my face

45:28.250 --> 45:29.750
and Eleanor screaming.

45:35.416 --> 45:36.416
Then...

45:37.375 --> 45:39.500
after that, it just all goes blank.

45:47.250 --> 45:49.166
When I woke up in the hospital,

45:51.333 --> 45:53.250
my mom told me she was gone.

46:00.958 --> 46:02.291
And that was it.

47:19.708 --> 47:21.291
Still mad you got in the car?

47:40.458 --> 47:42.875
- You really built this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

47:42.958 --> 47:43.958
That's impressive.

47:44.291 --> 47:46.791
- All right. Here we go.
- Let's do it.

47:46.958 --> 47:49.833
I'm gonna do it.

47:49.916 --> 47:51.556
Have a good one.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.833
I can see my house from here.

48:07.458 --> 48:08.458
Ah...

48:14.666 --> 48:17.541
Woo!

48:17.625 --> 48:18.625
Yeah!

48:19.041 --> 48:21.416
- That was amazing.
- Good job!

48:22.791 --> 48:24.125
Did it feel fast?

48:24.208 --> 48:27.416
Oh, yeah. It's just like the real thing.

48:27.750 --> 48:28.750
Are you ready?

48:30.125 --> 48:32.250
All right. Here we go. You ready?

48:32.333 --> 48:33.375
Oh, my God.

48:50.750 --> 48:52.375
Yes!

49:01.208 --> 49:02.750
Yeah!

49:02.833 --> 49:04.208
Yay!

49:05.875 --> 49:07.375
Oh, my God!

49:10.416 --> 49:11.833

I got you this...

50:37.541 --> 50:40.416
just in case you've forgotten
this is a school project,

50:41.083 --> 50:42.458
you have to write about it.

50:43.250 --> 50:44.291
Just me?

50:44.750 --> 50:45.916
You're the writer.

50:53.166 --> 50:54.666
"Wander number three..."

50:54.750 --> 50:56.500
No. You gotta start with Hoosier Hill.

50:56.583 --> 50:58.583
You know, you don't have to be so pushy.

50:58.666 --> 51:00.708
You say "pushy," and I hear, um...

51:01.208 --> 51:02.291
"assertive,"

51:02.750 --> 51:03.750
"bold,"

51:04.375 --> 51:05.375
"inspiring."

51:06.666 --> 51:08.791
Uh... relentless. Irritating.

51:09.291 --> 51:10.708
Arrogant.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.041
Sexy.

51:18.875 --> 51:20.666
It's nice to have a friend again.

51:27.416 --> 51:29.083
Don't let that go to your head.

51:31.458 --> 51:32.458
Too late.

51:40.416 --> 51:42.625
You know what I like about you,
Ultraviolet?

51:44.291 --> 51:45.291
What?

51:46.125 --> 51:49.708

55:28.458 --> 55:30.166
Hello.

55:31.708 --> 55:35.458
Before we get started,
we are nearing D-Day, people.

55:36.958 --> 55:39.166
The day to present your wanderings.

55:39.250 --> 55:40.250
That is correct.

55:40.333 --> 55:41.333
Along with your essay,

55:41.375 --> 55:46.916
I'm going to be asking each group
to do a presentation to the whole class.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.291
But today, we're talking about
the five themes of geography:

55:50.375 --> 55:51.916
location, place...

56:01.333 --> 56:04.583
No, but honestly,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

56:04.666 --> 56:06.541
- This is just what Finch does.
- Yeah.

56:07.416 --> 56:10.958
I've texted him for the past couple days,
and he hasn't responded.

56:11.041 --> 56:12.958
I mean, this is...

56:13.041 --> 56:17.833
...I mean, sometimes he's gone for a day,
like, maybe two, but he always turns up.

56:17.916 --> 56:20.958
Yeah, there was that one time
that he was gone for like a week.

56:21.041 --> 56:23.142
- Oh, my God.
- He came back and said he went camping,

56:23.166 --> 56:25.416
and he had all these poison ivy spots
on him...

56:25.500 --> 56:27.750
- Covered in spots.
- ...itching, it was like... yeah.

56:27.833 --> 56:29.708
It was bad. It was so bad.

56:29.791 --> 56:31.291
I think it's pretty fucked up.

56:32.583 --> 56:34.750
It's easy to pick up your phone
and respond.

56:34.833 --> 56:38.000
It's... that's just something
you have to deal with

56:38.083 --> 56:40.041
if you wanna be close with him, you know?

56:40.458 --> 56:41.833
It just makes me mad.

56:44.333 --> 56:46.892
Yeah. So, we've been to a lot
of really interesting places so far.

56:46.916 --> 56:48.625
Do you have an actual plan,

56:48.708 --> 56:50.875
or you've just kind of been shooting
from the hip?

56:50.958 --> 56:54.375
Honestly? I'm just trying to distract her
into spending as much time with me

56:54.458 --> 56:56.291
as she can.

56:56.375 --> 56:58.375
And has it been going OK, or...

56:58.458 --> 57:00.333
Yeah, I think so. I've been really...

57:01.166 --> 57:02.791
Look who stopped by.

57:04.083 --> 57:05.083
Hey.

57:06.541 --> 57:09.083
Did you lose your phone?
I've been texting. I've been calling.

57:09.166 --> 57:11.333
Look, let me just show
you this really fast. Hold on.

57:11.500 --> 57:13.916
- You could've taken a second to respond...
- I know.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.680
- ...so I knew you were OK.
- I had to take care of a couple things.

57:34.375 --> 57:36.250
It's supposedly bottomless.

57:37.666 --> 57:40.125
In the '50s,
a group of boys went swimming here,

57:41.166 --> 57:42.458
and they disappeared.

57:42.541 --> 57:44.125
No one ever found their bodies.

57:44.666 --> 57:45.833
They drowned?

57:47.208 --> 57:48.208
Eh...

57:48.791 --> 57:49.791
maybe.

57:51.708 --> 57:54.041
Or maybe they found the other side.

57:55.458 --> 57:59.041
They say there's a force in the middle
that sucks you into an underground river

57:59.125 --> 58:00.958
and leads you to another world.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.875
You're not going in?

58:09.833 --> 58:11.041
Oh, of course I am.

58:12.208 --> 58:13.958
It'll be freezing.

58:14.041 --> 58:15.208
It'll be fine.

58:19.958 --> 58:20.958
You should come in.

58:24.666 --> 58:26.958
- No, I'm good.
- What are you afraid of?

58:28.166 --> 58:30.416
- It's cold.
- Serious question:

58:32.166 --> 58:33.916
what are you most afraid of?

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Dying.

58:40.625 --> 58:41.750
I don't believe that.

58:44.583 --> 58:45.833
Being ordinary.

58:48.875 --> 58:50.291
So, don't be ordinary.

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.333
Oh, my God!

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.416
Oh. OK!

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:09.833
- Oh, you're right. Fucking freezing!
- Oh, my God!

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.291
OK, let's go under.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:12.791
- Yeah?
- OK.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.625
One, two, three.

01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:48.875
Marco!

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.833
Polo!

01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:04.166
So, what are <i> you</i> most afraid of?

01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:09.708
Uh...

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.500
I don't know. I guess losing my sister.

01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:20.875
My mom's gone a lot.

01:01:20.958 --> 01:01:22.416
My dad left a while ago.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:24.250
New town, new family.

01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:29.250
So, Kate's basically all I have.

01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:39.916
How'd you get that?

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.625
I'm going in search of the bottom.

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:26.208
Finch?

01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:36.041
Finch!

01:02:47.916 --> 01:02:48.916
Finch!

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:18.208
Asshole!

01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:19.916
What?

01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:22.750
Do you know how scared I was?

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:24.458
Hey.

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:26.916
Hey, Violet. Violet, I'm sorry!

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:33.708
Violet, I'm sorry.

01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:36.041
Violet!

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:38.458
I thought you drowned!

01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:42.625
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry.

01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:45.166
I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you.

01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:46.625
Well, you did.

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:49.958
That was the last thing
that I wanted to do.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.291
Where do you go when you disappear?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.125
Tell me something real about you.

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:07.333
Or I'm leaving.

01:04:07.916 --> 01:04:09.041
OK.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.000
Sometimes I have to go to places
that make me feel like myself.

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:18.541
I need to do things that remind me
that I'm in control.

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:28.125
My dad used to...

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:31.208
get in these dark moods.

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.208
Did he do that to you?

01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:45.666
I used to be a lot smaller.

01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:52.791
I used to not know
how to get out of the way.

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.541
People don't like messy, right?

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.708
- Uh...
- Yeah.

01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:54.208

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.332
- Finch!
- If I could...

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:29.916
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

01:08:30.832 --> 01:08:32.916
It was my fault. I fucked up.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.707
Please, just don't blame her. Please.
I'm sorry.

01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:38.916
Just... go home.

01:09:43.082 --> 01:09:44.457
Do you have any clue

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:48.916
what horrible situations we had you in,
in our heads?

01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:53.582
You have to understand how that felt,

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:56.791
your dad and I not knowing where you were.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.166
I said I was sorry.

01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:02.875
But you didn't have to treat Finch
like that.

01:10:02.958 --> 01:10:05.833
Well, he's the boy
that kept our daughter out all night.

01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:09.125
I kept him out all night, too, Mom.

01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:43.041
Hey.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:45.500
Hey, V. Hey, what's up?

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:47.250
How are you?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
- Fine.
- It's been a minute. What's been going on?

01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:51.500
I can't deal with you right now.

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:54.125
Is everything OK?

01:11:54.916 --> 01:11:56.666
Honestly, I don't know.

01:11:58.708 --> 01:12:00.041
I'm not tryin' to be an asshole,

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:01.885
but you should know
what you're getting into.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:05.375
- I do.
- No, you don't.

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:06.458
- He...
- Let's go.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.392
- Where've you been?
- You know why she's hangin' out with you?

01:12:09.416 --> 01:12:10.500
She's tryin' to fix you.

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:12.916
Shut up, Roamer! Just...

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:16.333
You have no idea
who he really is, do you? He's a freak!

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.958
- Call me a freak one more time.
- You're a fuckin' freak.

01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:24.041
Finch!

01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:25.125
Finch!

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.208
Stop!

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:28.041
Finch!

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:32.250
Finch! Yo, let him go, man. Get off him.

01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:35.916
Finch, stop! Stop!

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:42.000
Oh, my God!

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:44.291
What the hell?
He almost killed him.

01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:57.750
He's crazy.

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:17.875
Fuck!

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:20.625
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:38.083
Anything?

01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:43.916
Guess he's gone again.

01:13:47.916 --> 01:13:50.083
I've been friends with the guy
since minute one,

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.333
and I haven't waited
for his call in years.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
He just...

01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:58.458
gets in this mood sometimes, and...

01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:01.750
it's hard, you know?

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:04.833
He's not easy,

01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:08.875
and everybody who gets close to him
gets burned out.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.291
So, why do you stick around?

01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:20.750
Because...

01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:24.916
'cause I love him.

01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:30.041
He thinks everybody leaves him
and I won't do that.

01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:33.625
This is what we do.

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:37.875
I'm gonna get mad,
he's gonna come back and apologize,

01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:40.041
and it'll be like it never even happened.

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:52.958
Hey.

01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:55.958
Is... is Finch here?

01:14:56.958 --> 01:14:58.250
Did something happen?

01:15:00.958 --> 01:15:02.166
Yeah, come on in.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.375
I'm Lindsay.

01:15:07.458 --> 01:15:11.833
Um... I'm OCD and just got diagnosed
with a social anxiety disorder,

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:14.666
so being here with everyone
is not intimidating at all.

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:19.458
Last year, I started cutting myself.

01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:24.000
I still deal with it, but I'm here.

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:26.750
I'm so sorry.

01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:28.125
No worries. Have a seat.

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.291
Hi, I'm Bradley.

01:15:34.375 --> 01:15:41.000
Um... I am ADHD, OCD,
BPD, DID, and bipolar.

01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:42.541
Yeah.

01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:46.458
Um... you'd think some of those
would cancel the others out, but...

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.666
Yeah, my week's been OK.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.916
I've been watching
a lot of basketball lately,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.291
and that's been helping a lot, so...

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Good.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:57.916
Hi. Welcome.

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:02.875
Um...

01:16:05.041 --> 01:16:07.666
I'm, uh... Theodore Finch.

01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:10.833
No labels.

01:16:12.583 --> 01:16:16.125
Not really sure why I'm here.

01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:18.166
Uh...

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:25.041
I guess it's 'cause I...
I got in this fight at school and,

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.541
like,

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:31.541
I was there, but I wasn't there.

01:16:31.625 --> 01:16:33.625
I was watchin' myself, and...

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:38.875
uh...

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:41.833
I-I-I just get a little lost sometimes.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.333
I run... a lot.

01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:49.458
Sometimes that helps.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Kind of.

01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:57.708
I don't know. Is that enough?

01:16:58.666 --> 01:16:59.666
Sure.

01:17:00.125 --> 01:17:01.750
Thanks. Glad you're here.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.833
Amanda, why don't you go ahead?

01:17:10.166 --> 01:17:11.250
I'm Amanda.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:14.791
I'm bulimic.

01:17:16.291 --> 01:17:18.125
I've tried to kill myself twice.

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.291
I think about it almost every day.

01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:41.416
Hey, have you heard anything yet?

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:44.333
- No.
- OK.

01:17:45.458 --> 01:17:48.416
I gotta go to work. I'm gonna be late.
But you should stay.

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.750
Why does he keep doing this?

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:55.708
I don't know.

01:18:00.041 --> 01:18:02.250
Have him call me
when you hear from him, OK?

01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:05.041
Yeah.

01:18:05.291 --> 01:18:06.583
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:14.291
<i>I heard you beat the shit outta Roamer.</i>

01:18:16.583 --> 01:18:18.103
Why do you keep doing stuff like that?

01:18:18.166 --> 01:18:20.541
Aren't you tired of people
talking about you all the time?

01:18:22.166 --> 01:18:23.916
People are always gonna talk.

01:18:24.916 --> 01:18:26.166
It's their specialty.

01:18:29.583 --> 01:18:30.583
Are you OK?

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:37.666
I don't know.
I feel like I keep messing things up,

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:42.166
and I'm not sure
I know how to not do that.

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:43.625
Does this work?

01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:47.458
It's better than the alternative.

01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:37.293
<i>Your girlfriend's pretty worried
about you.</i>

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:39.625
She's been at the house all afternoon.

01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:44.041
What's going on?

01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:52.166
I don't... really remember...

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:55.250
Dad that well.

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:58.708
And everything I do...

01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:03.458
remember is... is bad.

01:20:07.208 --> 01:20:08.375
Are there any...

01:20:09.583 --> 01:20:11.750
good memories you have of him?

01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:17.916
Well, the fact that he would
beat the shit out of us

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.833
kind of negated all the good times.

01:20:26.916 --> 01:20:29.500
But why was he like that?

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:32.333
Was he like that because of us? Was he...

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:34.875
like that because of Mom?

01:20:34.958 --> 01:20:37.375
He was like that
because he was a shitty person.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.833
There has to be a reason, though.

01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:43.000
Because if there's a reason,
then he could get better.

01:20:43.083 --> 01:20:44.166
Something or...

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.416
someone could make him better, right?

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:51.875
I don't know. Who cares?
Dude, he's someone else's problem.

01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:54.000
Why are you asking me about Dad?

01:20:57.875 --> 01:20:59.291
What's going on, Finch?

01:21:03.541 --> 01:21:05.458
Come on. You can talk to me, man.

01:21:08.333 --> 01:21:10.125
Nothing, Kate.

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:11.291
Sorry. Nothing.

01:21:12.666 --> 01:21:13.666
I'm good.

01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:16.916
Are you sure?
Because I have to open the bar,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.750
- but I can find someone to cover me.
- I'm good.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.500
You know I love you, right, Theo?

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:30.750
I know.

01:22:13.791 --> 01:22:14.875
You scared me.

01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:22.916
What is all of this?

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:27.250
I'm trying to focus.

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:29.583
Focus on what?

01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:32.291
On staying awake.

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:37.000
I don't understand what that means.

01:22:38.708 --> 01:22:40.166
Sometimes I...

01:22:41.125 --> 01:22:42.333
go blank.

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:46.875
I... get into these dark moods.

01:22:48.041 --> 01:22:50.666
I think too fast
to keep track of anything,

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:53.041
and then it's like...

01:22:54.208 --> 01:22:57.041
all my thoughts are gone at once.

01:22:58.458 --> 01:23:01.791
And sometimes,
if I put 'em up there, I can...

01:23:02.208 --> 01:23:04.333
focus and slow down, but...

01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:09.791
I can't right now. I can't.

01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:12.958
OK.

01:23:14.125 --> 01:23:15.916
And this usually works.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.791
Maybe there's too much clutter.

01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:23.708
I can fix it. I just...

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:27.000
I just need time to figure this out.

01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:33.291
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need your help!

01:23:33.833 --> 01:23:36.541
This is on me! This isn't about you!

01:23:38.833 --> 01:23:40.708
You need to tell me what's wrong.

01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:45.458
You don't get it.

01:23:51.583 --> 01:23:52.666
You're right.

01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:55.083
I don't get it.

01:23:58.416 --> 01:24:00.041
Don't you know, Violet?

01:24:03.666 --> 01:24:04.875
I'm "The Freak."

01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:10.291
I'm fucked up!

01:24:22.875 --> 01:24:24.000
I need you to leave.

01:24:29.916 --> 01:24:30.916
Go!

01:25:39.458 --> 01:25:41.708
<i>Hey, it's Finch. Leave a message.</i>

01:25:43.666 --> 01:25:45.375
Hey, Finch. Um...

01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:49.250
I'm sorry.

01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:51.833
I'm just sorry that I pushed.

01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:53.666
And... I...

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.666
just need you to come back.

01:26:00.958 --> 01:26:03.500
I just really need you to come back, OK?

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:31.916
Hey, kiddo.

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:33.750
Hey.

01:26:39.875 --> 01:26:40.875
Dad?

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:44.333
Yeah?

01:26:48.041 --> 01:26:49.500
On Eleanor's birthday...

01:26:53.958 --> 01:26:54.958
I...

01:26:57.833 --> 01:26:59.250
I wasn't really thinking.

01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:06.708
I found myself at the bridge.

01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:12.416
I was standing on a ledge.

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:18.583
That's how I met Finch.

01:27:19.666 --> 01:27:20.958
He found me there.

01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:26.875
He saved me.

01:27:29.916 --> 01:27:31.208
You... you weren't gonna...

01:27:31.666 --> 01:27:32.666
I'm OK.

01:27:35.958 --> 01:27:36.958
I was...

01:27:38.166 --> 01:27:39.166
confused.

01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:42.541
I was sad.

01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:46.458
I'm OK.

01:27:50.333 --> 01:27:51.458
I'm better now.

01:27:54.916 --> 01:27:55.916
Wow.

01:27:57.958 --> 01:28:00.000
Well, I'm glad Finch was there.

01:28:02.875 --> 01:28:03.875
Me too.

01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:11.750
I just wish I knew where he was.

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:15.750
Well...

01:28:18.583 --> 01:28:20.708
you two have been a lot of places.

01:28:21.833 --> 01:28:23.875
Is there any place else he might go?

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.666
Finch!

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:02.000
Finch!

01:30:05.625 --> 01:30:06.666
Finch.

01:30:34.458 --> 01:30:36.416
Marco!

01:31:54.583 --> 01:31:56.541
On behalf of Finch's family,

01:31:56.625 --> 01:31:59.000
I wanna thank you all
for being here today.

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:03.750
We've gathered to celebrate
and to honor the memory of one

01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:07.875
who will be incredibly missed
because he has been so dearly loved.

01:32:08.625 --> 01:32:10.541
The events of these past few days...

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.250
I'm gonna say bye.

01:32:48.333 --> 01:32:49.875
OK, we'll wait for you.

01:32:53.166 --> 01:32:54.166
Hey.

01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:17.541
I should've been there.

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.625
I miss him.

01:33:37.458 --> 01:33:39.500
Just so fucked.

01:33:52.791 --> 01:33:54.125
I had no idea.

01:33:59.083 --> 01:34:01.041
Sorry that I wasn't there for you.

01:34:04.125 --> 01:34:05.125
It's OK.

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:08.875
I didn't know how to tell you.

01:34:14.208 --> 01:34:15.375
I would miss you.

01:34:20.125 --> 01:34:21.833
Yeah, I know you would.

01:36:05.583 --> 01:36:07.750
"Travelers' Prayer Chapel,

01:36:10.083 --> 01:36:11.458
created as a sanctuary

01:36:11.541 --> 01:36:15.208
for the weary travelers
to stop and rest along their way.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.375
It was built in memoriam to those

01:36:18.458 --> 01:36:21.208
who have lost their lives
in auto accidents...

01:36:26.041 --> 01:36:27.916
and as a place for healing.

01:36:32.208 --> 01:36:34.833
We remember those who are no longer here,

01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:37.791
who were taken from us too soon,

01:36:37.875 --> 01:36:40.333
and who we will always keep
in our hearts."

01:37:31.291 --> 01:37:33.333
<i>I used to be worried
about everything.</i>

01:37:36.333 --> 01:37:38.041
<i>Things that seemed meaningful...</i>

01:37:39.375 --> 01:37:41.000
were actually meaningless.

01:37:42.166 --> 01:37:43.583
I worried about life.

01:37:47.041 --> 01:37:50.041
I worried about what would happen
if I let myself feel again.

01:37:52.583 --> 01:37:54.166
I thought I didn't deserve to.

01:38:01.291 --> 01:38:02.291
Then...

01:38:03.625 --> 01:38:05.166
without really knowing...

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.583
I changed.

01:38:15.333 --> 01:38:18.875
I wasn't worried
about what would happen if I lived.

01:38:20.958 --> 01:38:23.291
I was worried about
what would happen if I didn't.

01:38:25.625 --> 01:38:26.958
What I would miss.

01:38:28.833 --> 01:38:30.708
I worried about not remembering.

01:38:32.125 --> 01:38:34.333
Not remembering all of the moments...

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.541
all of the places...

01:38:46.416 --> 01:38:48.166
...and that's because of Finch.

01:38:52.958 --> 01:38:54.833
Because he taught me to wander.

01:39:00.166 --> 01:39:03.166
<i>He taught me
that you don't have to climb a mountain</i>

01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:05.000
<i>to stand on top of the world.</i>

01:39:09.208 --> 01:39:13.875
<i>That even the ugliest of places
can be beautiful,</i>

01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:16.666
<i>as long as you take the time to look.</i>

01:39:25.166 --> 01:39:27.041
<i>That it's OK to get lost...</i>

01:39:31.083 --> 01:39:32.916
<i>as long as you find your way back.</i>

01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:41.833
<i>But in learning all of that,</i>

01:39:42.833 --> 01:39:45.166
<i>I missed seeing
something more important...</i>

01:39:48.625 --> 01:39:49.791
<i>seeing Finch.</i>

01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:55.000
<i>I missed that he was in pain.</i>

01:40:03.708 --> 01:40:06.291
<i>I missed that he was teaching me
all along</i>

01:40:07.541 --> 01:40:08.750
<i>how to move on.</i>

01:40:14.125 --> 01:40:15.583
<i>Finch was a dreamer.</i>

01:40:18.708 --> 01:40:20.458
<i>He dreamt while he was awake.</i>

01:40:23.958 --> 01:40:28.125
<i>He dreamt of all the beauty in the world,
and he made it come to life.</i>

01:40:33.166 --> 01:40:38.583
Finch taught me that there's beauty
in the most unexpected of places.

01:40:44.125 --> 01:40:46.000
And that there are bright places,

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.500
even in dark times.

01:40:58.041 --> 01:40:59.458
And that if there isn't...

01:41:02.708 --> 01:41:04.750
you can be that bright place...

01:41:06.583 --> 01:41:08.958
