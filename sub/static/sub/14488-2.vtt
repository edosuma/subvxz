you now, Leela.

What about
Zapp Brannigan?

00:39.123 --> 00:42.333
Well, obviously,
Zapp Brannigan
could save you...

00:42.626 --> 00:43.793
Zapp Brannigan!

00:43.877 --> 00:46.921
So, Emperor Chop Chop,
once again, we meet at last.

So, I will.

volunteer for treason.

Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.276
Mr. President.

At ease, Brannigan.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.997
At 0000 hours,

02:03.081 --> 02:06.542
Planet X-3 was attacked
by a mysterious death sphere.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.877
Magnify that death sphere.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.423
Why is it still blurry?

That poor, brave hardware.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.693
NIXON: The sphere
then fired some kind of
hellish blackout ray.

02:32.778 --> 02:36.531
It erased that planet
like 18 minutes of
incriminating tape.

02:39.743 --> 02:43.162
Oh, I just wish
I understood why.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.664
Why I should care?

02:44.748 --> 02:47.458
Because the death sphere
is now on course for Earth!

02:55.092 --> 02:56.884
My instinct is to
hide in this barrel,

02:56.969 --> 02:58.386
like the wily fish.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.888
Then we're down
to our last hope,

as crazy!

03:09.731 --> 03:12.942
Let's see how crazy
I am now, Nixon.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.361
The correct answer
is "very."

03:15.445 --> 03:16.779
All right, Professor,

03:16.864 --> 03:18.155

03:18.323 --> 03:20.116
Top-secret news,
everyone.

03:20.200 --> 03:25.246
I've developed a tiny,
one-man stealth fighter
that's virtually undetectable.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.831
How undetectable?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.249
It's right in front of you.

But how exactly is
this Happy Meal toy

03:36.800 --> 03:38.634
going to destroy
a giant death sphere?

03:38.719 --> 03:39.886
From within.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.471
This ship should be able
to sneak, undetected,

03:42.556 --> 03:45.057
through the sphere's
one vulnerable opening.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.601
What vulnerable opening?

03:46.685 --> 03:49.395
All death spheres have
one vulnerable opening.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.189
Well, sure,
but who's brave enough
to fly into something

03:52.274 --> 03:54.317
we all keep calling
a death sphere?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.319

I say no.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.446
I say me.
I say Leela!

03:58.530 --> 04:00.656
I say yes.
I say no.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.991
I say Leela, too.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.284
I say yes again.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.869
I say I shall join her.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.247
But it's only
a one-man craft, I say.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.000
There'll only be
one man. Me.

How would you feel
if I rode rear as your
personal tail gunner?

04:15.339 --> 04:16.464
Creeped out.

Are you sure I have to
sit in your lap?

Hmm. I don't like

those call letters?

Nope. It's not in the

the satellites collided
shortly after launch

heard from again.

makes perfect sense.

starting to miss him.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.185
Maybe you two
belong together.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.562
We do not.
And you can't talk.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.730
Come on.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.358
It must be
an awful temptation.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.611
Guess who just
killed a woodchuck
with his bare feet?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.281
I thought I'd whip
us up some shelter,

12:21.366 --> 12:23.158
make this a little more
like home.

12:23.284 --> 12:27.413
I do miss the Earth terribly.
I wonder if it's even
still there.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.997
Let's find out together.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.501
I'll brave
the ship's wreckage
to fetch you the telescope.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.586
That's so sweet.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.505
I'm just saying, is all.

12:48.935 --> 12:53.439
I know my new plan
is a long shot, but it's
the only hope left.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.649
Well, now
I've heard everything.

12:55.859 --> 12:56.859
On my iPod.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.195
So, do you have
a new plan, Professor?
And is there any hope left?

13:00.405 --> 13:04.158
Indeed. We're here on
Earth's last unspoiled acre

13:04.242 --> 13:07.911
to show the death sphere
there's still purity
in the world.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.580

13:11.541 --> 13:13.667

Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Leela.

14:05.386 --> 14:09.139
Maybe this was
meant to be.

14:09.224 --> 14:12.267
Maybe you and I
were meant to build
a new world here.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.353
We can avoid
humanity's mistakes.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.479
Like the tuba.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.232
Yes! We'll be
like Adam and Eve.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.775
Only without the tuba.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.736
And we'll beget
little Zapp junior.
And Leela junior.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.155
And they'll have
kids of their... Yuck!

14:25.240 --> 14:27.533
Is that really what
happened in the Bible?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.369
It's a sick and twisted
book of holiness, all right.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.995
Then we'll write
our own Bible.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.957
With less Sodom
and more Gomorrah.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.124
Let's do it.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.710
I shall become the mother
of a new world,

14:38.795 --> 14:40.546

under this tree.

The tree of knowledge!

14:42.423 --> 14:44.466
Look, it even has apples!

14:44.759 --> 14:45.759
Ow!

14:46.135 --> 14:47.261
Wow.

14:48.930 --> 14:52.599
Come here, Adam.
Partake of my
forbidden fruit.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.977
Thee will be done.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.656
Wait. One more bite
before we begin
the begetting.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.951
Mmm. Juicy.

15:11.035 --> 15:15.330
Those nut berries you
found were so salty,
I couldn't think straight.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.459
I mean,
not to belabor it,

15:19.544 --> 15:22.879
but they were as salty
as that bag of trail mix
Fry gave me.

15:23.506 --> 15:27.467
Exactly as salty.
Hey! Wait a second!

15:28.011 --> 15:29.136
Uh...

15:31.556 --> 15:33.181
(GROANING)

15:33.850 --> 15:36.852
I have a terrible
confession to make.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.605
You see, when I first
went foraging,

15:39.689 --> 15:43.483
what I actually found
was the smoldering
wreckage of the ship.

15:43.568 --> 15:48.030
Ignoring all danger,
I charged inside to
liberate our provisions.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.949
So, this is the
trail mix Fry gave me!

15:51.659 --> 15:55.829
Yes. I exaggerated
when I said I picked it
from the treetops.

15:55.913 --> 15:59.750
I just wanted you to think
a little better of me.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.628
Well, your motives
were good.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.464
And we were both
loopy from dehydration.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.548
Hey, wait.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.967
You've been doing
an awful lot of urinating.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.969
(GROANING)

16:11.763 --> 16:14.139
There's plenty of water.
You see,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.808
after I selflessly
rescued the trail mix,

16:16.893 --> 16:20.062
I braved the flames once more
in search of fluids.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.070
Then why didn't
you give me any?

16:28.905 --> 16:31.990
I thought it might
help you forget your
intense hatred for me

16:32.075 --> 16:34.368
if you were
a teensy bit delirious.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.495
So, you let me dehydrate

16:36.579 --> 16:40.248
while you washed down
the trail mix with
imported mineral water?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.583
(GROANING)

16:41.918 --> 16:43.251
Not exactly.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.337
You see,
besides the trail mix,

16:45.421 --> 16:47.839
the minibar also
contained Doritos,
beef jerky

16:47.924 --> 16:50.759
and a generous assortment
of fine chocolates.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.262
I wanted to offer you
the chocolates.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.683
I truly did.
But I was concerned
about your waistline.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.142
Very concerned.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.478
It's because
I haven't been exercising.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.564
If only this tree
hadn't fallen on me
by chance.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.698
It was just after
we crashed.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.492
I awoke first,
to find you trapped.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.286
Leela! Leela, wake up.

17:31.426 --> 17:35.220
You could've moved
this grub-infested log
any time you wanted?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.638
Well, sure.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.224
But then I wouldn't have
been able to provide
the loving care

17:39.308 --> 17:40.559
you wouldn't have needed.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.064
I'd leave you to rot
in this paradise,

17:46.149 --> 17:48.316
if only the ship
weren't destroyed.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.445

isn't it?

after re-trapping you

17:56.325 --> 17:57.909
and before
feigning unconsciousness,

17:57.994 --> 18:00.036
I paused to enjoy a cigar.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.998
Though mellow and satisfying,
it did parch me a bit,

18:03.082 --> 18:04.958
so I went in
search of brandy.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.920
That's when
my keen senses detected
the still-invisible ship.

no Earth anymore.
