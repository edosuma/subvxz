Are you hungry?

00:16.552 --> 00:18.219
Would you get us something?

00:18.220 --> 00:19.253
You bet.

00:19.254 --> 00:20.588
Come on, let's go.

00:20.589 --> 00:22.623
We'll be back.

00:22.624 --> 00:24.642
Girl: What's his name?

00:24.643 --> 00:26.154
I don't know.

00:26.155 --> 00:28.399
I'd call him spicy.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.923
What about that one?

00:31.924 --> 00:33.290
Sugar?

00:33.291 --> 00:34.846
Sugar and spice?

00:34.847 --> 00:36.210
Spicy.

00:38.508 --> 00:40.573
It's too scratchy.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.204
Itchy. It's itchy.

00:42.205 --> 00:44.706
That's why you're scratching.

00:44.707 --> 00:46.204
Lindsay!

00:46.205 --> 00:48.339
Lindsay! Lindsay!

00:48.340 --> 00:51.606
Lindsay! Has anyone
seen my daughter?

00:51.607 --> 00:53.203
Ohh!

00:53.204 --> 00:56.002
Lindsay! Help!

00:59.004 --> 01:01.103
Aimee.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.805
Aimee?

01:03.806 --> 01:05.471
Aimee!

01:06.607 --> 01:08.406
Aimee?

01:10.772 --> 01:12.738
Barbara, what's going on?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.940
She was just right here.
She's not here.

01:14.941 --> 01:16.408
Did she come to you guys?

01:16.409 --> 01:17.409
No. Where is she?

01:17.410 --> 01:18.743
She was just right here.

01:18.744 --> 01:20.944
Aimee! Aimee!

01:20.945 --> 01:21.945
What do you mean, she's gone?

01:21.946 --> 01:23.147
Which way did she go?

01:23.148 --> 01:24.149
I don't know.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.483
Aimee!

01:27.149 --> 01:29.880
Mrs. Lynch?

01:29.881 --> 01:31.214
We're with the fbi.

01:31.215 --> 01:33.845
Is this the most recent
photo you have of aimee?

01:33.846 --> 01:35.544
Yes.

01:35.545 --> 01:37.575
Aimee lynch, 8 years old,

01:37.576 --> 01:40.873
Was taken an hour ago from a
winter festival in ashburn.

01:40.874 --> 01:42.506
Any witnesses? Her mom barbara

01:42.507 --> 01:43.869
Was right next to her
when she vanished.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.434
There must have been
hundreds of people there.

01:45.435 --> 01:46.730
No one saw anything?

01:46.731 --> 01:47.964
It's a temporary gathering,

01:47.965 --> 01:49.131
With little to no security.

01:49.132 --> 01:50.632
All right, reid,

01:50.633 --> 01:51.965
You and I are going to
head to the family's house.

01:51.966 --> 01:53.333
The two of you,
I want you to work with garcia.

01:53.334 --> 01:54.500
We need to look at
every local abduction

01:54.501 --> 01:55.634
Or attempted one in the past year,

01:55.635 --> 01:56.934
See if there's any overlap.

01:56.935 --> 01:58.768
Good news is that we're
barely into the second hour.

01:58.769 --> 02:01.670
Yeah, well, odds are we've only
got 22 hours to find aimee alive,

02:01.671 --> 02:03.337
So let's do this.

02:12.609 --> 02:15.876
Aimee lynch of ashburn was last
seen at the winter festival

02:15.877 --> 02:17.710
This morning at 10:00.

02:17.711 --> 02:20.144
She's 4'8", has blond
hair and green eyes.

02:20.145 --> 02:23.546
With temperatures below
freezing and a chance of snow,

02:23.547 --> 02:24.913
The pressure's on to find her.

02:24.914 --> 02:26.681
Anyone with information about aimee

02:26.682 --> 02:28.415
Please contact the hotline.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.049
Uh, excuse me.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.050
I'd like to talk to agent jareau.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.218
Can I help you?

02:34.219 --> 02:38.086
Whoever took aimee
lynch took my son, too.

02:40.789 --> 02:42.722
Ashburn has a winter
festival every year,

02:42.723 --> 02:44.556
And not a single
attempt at kidnapping.

02:44.557 --> 02:47.224
Hey, jj, there's a woman
here who says her son

02:47.225 --> 02:48.892
Was abducted by the same offender.

02:48.893 --> 02:50.960
[sighs] has she been drinking?

02:50.961 --> 02:53.661
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
How'd you know that?

02:53.662 --> 02:56.329
Sarah hillridge. She lost
her son charlie 8 years ago.

02:56.330 --> 02:59.431
She comes in every time a child
around his age goes missing.

02:59.432 --> 03:01.365
She thinks her son is still alive?

03:01.366 --> 03:02.699
Yeah, I know.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.767
I remember her. She stays for
the first 24 hours, right?

03:04.768 --> 03:06.368
Yeah.

03:06.369 --> 03:09.537
There's only 8 hours left.

03:13.441 --> 03:14.407
Any more coffee?

03:14.408 --> 03:16.608
Oh, no, no. I'm fine, thanks.

03:17.776 --> 03:21.277
Ohh. What's henry, is he 16 months?

03:21.278 --> 03:23.078
Uh, 17.

03:24.047 --> 03:26.814
Uh, how's your daughter?

03:28.049 --> 03:30.149
Uh, jake took her away.

03:30.150 --> 03:31.584
What?

03:31.585 --> 03:33.485
Well, he got remarried, and, uh,

03:33.486 --> 03:37.554
Thought it was best for
emily to get a fresh start.

03:39.122 --> 03:40.222
Sorry.

03:40.223 --> 03:41.923
Well, I can't really blame him.

03:41.924 --> 03:43.457
I mean, look at me.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.525
Sarah, I really need--

03:45.526 --> 03:47.693
This little girl aimee was 8,
just like charlie.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.995
They were taken
almost 8 years apart.

03:50.996 --> 03:54.897
Now, I have been doing a lot of
reading about sexual attraction

03:54.898 --> 03:58.732
And know that prepubescence
has the greatest range

03:58.733 --> 04:02.635
And also a really huge
crossover gender-wise.

04:04.304 --> 04:06.338
I'm sorry you know all of that.

04:06.339 --> 04:08.606
I could have gone my whole
life without knowing it,

04:08.607 --> 04:10.774
But then someone took my son.

04:42.563 --> 04:44.430
Boy: It's ok.

04:44.431 --> 04:46.165
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.333
Come here.

04:47.334 --> 04:50.369
Come on, come here.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.772
What's your name?

04:53.773 --> 04:56.908
You gotta tell me your name
before they give you a new one.

04:56.909 --> 04:59.009
Woman: What are you doing?

04:59.010 --> 05:00.644
What do you think you're doing?

05:00.645 --> 05:01.611
[slaps]

05:01.612 --> 05:04.447
Boy: It's not fair. Let her go!

05:04.448 --> 05:08.147
[grunting] [woman shouting]

05:08.148 --> 05:09.581
Aah!

05:09.582 --> 05:11.449
Woman: Don't talk to me like that!

05:11.450 --> 05:13.850
You will never talk
to me like that again!

05:14.986 --> 05:16.452
Ok. Got it.

05:16.453 --> 05:19.455
Aimee's mom was distracted by a
mother looking for her daughter,

05:19.456 --> 05:21.756
And she's blaming herself
for looking away.

05:21.757 --> 05:26.593
Wait. Sarah--sarah said the same
thing when charlie was taken.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.463
There was a mother
searching for her lost son.

05:29.464 --> 05:32.032
Do you...Do you think
it's a coincidence?

05:32.033 --> 05:34.769
Or what? A ruse?

05:34.770 --> 05:36.471
A woman looking for her lost son--

05:36.472 --> 05:37.805
That's pretty specific, right?

05:37.806 --> 05:39.974
Add to that a
target-rich environment

05:39.975 --> 05:41.777
With no security? Yeah.

05:41.778 --> 05:45.182
Ok, so, if the woman was a
distraction, who took aimee?

05:45.183 --> 05:46.550
A partner?

05:46.551 --> 05:48.885
Well, if it's the same people,

05:48.886 --> 05:51.821
They've been doing this
for close to a decade.

05:53.023 --> 05:55.191
I told you.

05:58.661 --> 06:01.395
* mama's gonna buy you *

06:01.396 --> 06:03.264
* a billy goat *

06:03.265 --> 06:05.765
[humming]

06:24.649 --> 06:27.083

"hope is the worst of evils,

torment of man."

07:34.732 --> 07:35.732
So that's it, then?

07:35.733 --> 07:37.067
No, it isn't.

07:37.068 --> 07:38.668
Well, why are you leaving?

07:38.669 --> 07:40.768
Every available cop in the state
is out looking for your daughter.

07:40.769 --> 07:43.034
Who's been gone for
more than 24 hours.

07:43.035 --> 07:44.869
I think we both know
what that means.

07:44.870 --> 07:46.037
Percentile-wise we do,

07:46.038 --> 07:47.771
But every case is based
on its own merit.

07:47.772 --> 07:49.106
Well, what merit is this case?

07:49.107 --> 07:52.776
Sir, aimee was taken at high
risk by whoever took her.

07:52.777 --> 07:54.711
It means it was organized,
meticulously planned,

07:54.712 --> 07:56.679
And likely more than one person.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.214
This suggests that they
intend on keeping her.

07:58.215 --> 08:00.182
Keeping her? For what?

08:00.183 --> 08:01.450
Frank?

08:04.220 --> 08:05.854
Keeping her means that she's alive,

08:05.855 --> 08:07.122
And I think that's really

08:07.123 --> 08:09.590
All you need to focus on right now.

08:09.591 --> 08:10.657
Are you leaving?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.158
Ma'am, our profile remains,

08:12.159 --> 08:14.893
As do hundreds of officers and many
agents looking for your daughter.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.361
Now, if there's any information

08:16.362 --> 08:17.996
Pertaining to aimee,
then we'll be back.

08:22.167 --> 08:24.101
Mr. Lynch, I think you should know

08:24.102 --> 08:26.004
That nothing could have
stopped these people

08:26.005 --> 08:27.407
From taking your daughter.

08:27.408 --> 08:29.376
Yeah.

08:29.377 --> 08:31.310
I would have never
let go of her hand.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.246
Frank, please.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.380
Frank.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.216
We've done all we can.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.052
It doesn't make walking
away any easier.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.955
No, it doesn't.

08:55.365 --> 08:57.166
They want to call you alison.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.901
But that's not my name.

08:59.902 --> 09:01.370
What is it?

09:01.371 --> 09:04.673
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.108
I'm not a stranger.

09:08.177 --> 09:10.912
I'm your brother.

09:12.481 --> 09:14.913
Why did you bring me here?

09:15.980 --> 09:18.847
They call me david.

09:18.848 --> 09:21.349
I want my mommy.

09:23.651 --> 09:25.218
Tell me your name.

09:25.219 --> 09:27.554
Aimee.

09:30.524 --> 09:32.158
Ok, aimee.

09:48.539 --> 09:50.540
Look, we all think that
aimee could be alive.

09:50.541 --> 09:52.041
No one's given up on her.

09:52.042 --> 09:53.874
That's why there's hundreds
of volunteers and officers

09:53.875 --> 09:55.308
Combing every inch of the county.

09:55.309 --> 09:57.644
But they're dragging the rivers
and digging up the woods.

09:57.645 --> 09:59.878
That's not gonna help us if
aimee is still with the unsub,

09:59.879 --> 10:01.079
If she's still alive out there.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.247
What about charlie?

10:02.248 --> 10:03.749
Is he still alive?

10:03.750 --> 10:05.216
Sarah believes it.

10:05.217 --> 10:07.851
8 years she's been saying
the same thing, jj.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.888
Have you thought about why
you suddenly believe her?

10:13.490 --> 10:16.158
Do you think it might be
because you're a mother?

10:17.294 --> 10:19.061
It's--it's because another woman

10:19.062 --> 10:21.397
Just walked in here
with the same exact ruse

10:21.398 --> 10:23.199
Used 8 years ago.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.968
I can't deny that. Can you?

10:25.969 --> 10:28.204
All I'm saying is,
if we go from a single abduction

10:28.205 --> 10:29.872
To multiple abductions
over 10 years,

10:29.873 --> 10:31.140
That changes everything.

10:31.141 --> 10:32.875
We all have to be convinced
that's what it is,

10:32.876 --> 10:35.345
Based on an unbiased profile.

10:36.214 --> 10:38.014
Ok. Distraction of a lost child.

10:38.015 --> 10:41.183
8-year-old victims taken
from public places

10:41.184 --> 10:42.618
With little to no security.

10:42.619 --> 10:44.387
That's not just the same ruse.

10:44.388 --> 10:45.522
That's a signature.

10:45.523 --> 10:47.423
And I'm not a mother.

10:47.424 --> 10:49.058
Charlie would be 16 now.

10:49.059 --> 10:50.826
We all know that
preferential offenders

10:50.827 --> 10:52.094
Typically dispose of their victims

10:52.095 --> 10:53.596
Before they reach puberty.

10:53.597 --> 10:55.398
Maybe he serves another purpose.

10:55.399 --> 10:57.701
Aimee's mom said the
unsub was slight.

10:57.702 --> 11:00.537
It wouldn't be easy to keep
a teenager under her thumb.

11:00.538 --> 11:03.240
Except that she's had him
since he was 8 years old.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.909
By now, he's completely
submissive to her.

11:05.910 --> 11:07.044
Reid: Keeping him could explain

11:07.045 --> 11:09.548
Why charlie's body was never found.

11:11.050 --> 11:12.317
Garcia.

11:12.318 --> 11:13.385
Sir.

11:13.386 --> 11:14.921
Go back 10 years nationwide.

11:14.922 --> 11:17.357
Start with abductions and
target-rich environments.

11:17.358 --> 11:20.260
Rule out any with bodily recovery,
dead or alive.

11:20.261 --> 11:21.594
I'm gonna let sarah know.

11:21.595 --> 11:22.695
Ok.

11:22.696 --> 11:24.564
We need to check out
aimee's abduction site

11:24.565 --> 11:25.632
With new eyes.

11:25.633 --> 11:28.902
[door unlocking]

11:28.903 --> 11:30.667
[creaks]

11:34.403 --> 11:35.536
They're home.

11:35.537 --> 11:37.404
Who is?

11:39.942 --> 11:42.312
Do what they say. Ok?

11:42.313 --> 11:43.980
It'll make it easier.

11:43.981 --> 11:45.215
Man: David!

11:45.216 --> 11:47.451
What are you doing here?

11:47.452 --> 11:49.386
Taking pictures again?

11:49.387 --> 11:51.487
Now get the hell out of here!

11:51.488 --> 11:53.523
Woman: Get out.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.088
Man: Well...

11:57.089 --> 11:59.857
Looks like somebody's been sleeping

11:59.858 --> 12:01.860
In goldilocks' bed.

12:01.861 --> 12:03.394
[woman laughs]

12:03.395 --> 12:06.531
Man: What have we got under here?

12:06.532 --> 12:09.400
Let's take a little look-see.

12:11.936 --> 12:14.938
Well, hello there.

12:14.939 --> 12:15.905
Hoo-ooh!

12:15.906 --> 12:17.874
I just want to go home.

12:17.875 --> 12:21.776
Woman: Ohh... You are home, alison.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.544
Man on tv: Now the traffic.

12:28.545 --> 12:30.846
A 3-car pileup on the 66

12:30.847 --> 12:32.947
Has traffic backed up both ways.

12:32.948 --> 12:35.215
Police are asking drivers
to find alternate routes.

12:35.216 --> 12:36.249
Sarah?

12:36.250 --> 12:37.350
Back to you, jane.

12:37.351 --> 12:38.517
Jane: Thanks, bill.

12:38.518 --> 12:40.885
Aimee lynch was last seen
wearing a winter coat...

12:40.886 --> 12:42.019
Sarah, it's jennifer.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.220
She was with her family
at the winter festival

12:44.221 --> 12:45.453
In ashburn.

12:45.454 --> 12:47.021
The family has not put
out a statement yet,

12:47.022 --> 12:48.956
As the authorities are
handling the case.

12:48.957 --> 12:51.092
Anyone with information about aimee

12:51.093 --> 12:52.326
Please contact the hotline.

12:52.327 --> 12:53.893
Sarah?

13:08.636 --> 13:11.336
Not hard to profile, is it?

13:12.204 --> 13:14.173
You think I'm insane?

13:16.842 --> 13:18.909
No.

13:18.910 --> 13:21.345
What do you think?

13:21.346 --> 13:24.314
I think the same thing you do.

13:25.849 --> 13:27.850
What do you mean?

13:29.152 --> 13:32.620
I think the same
people that took aimee

13:32.621 --> 13:34.388
Took charlie.

13:39.993 --> 13:43.295
I want to show you something.

13:43.296 --> 13:45.864
Since 2000, over 200 children's
bodies have not been found.

13:45.865 --> 13:47.999
Nationwide. What about virginia?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.133
Of the missing and presumed dead,
there are 12.

13:50.134 --> 13:51.869
Uh, charlie's been on
the list for 8 years,

13:51.870 --> 13:53.171
Aimee just joined it.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.473
So aimee was taken from ashburn,

13:55.474 --> 13:58.609
Charlie from leesburg, 8 years ago,

13:58.610 --> 14:00.644
Both within a half
mile of the highway.

14:00.645 --> 14:01.779
What about the others?

14:01.780 --> 14:04.314
Karla hartway was abducted in 1999,

14:04.315 --> 14:05.916
Age 8, from garrisonville.

14:05.917 --> 14:08.986
Stephen shepherd, abducted 2003,
also 8, from arlington.

14:08.987 --> 14:10.120
Danny kenman...

14:10.121 --> 14:12.822
Sarah: Abducted June 12 at 4:
00 from the mall.

14:12.823 --> 14:14.157
Parents divorced.

14:14.158 --> 14:15.124
He's still missing.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.059
Jj: What do the flowers mean?

14:17.060 --> 14:19.594
They were all found dead.

14:19.595 --> 14:22.763
But all the rest are still missing.

14:22.764 --> 14:24.365
Like tracey cain, 9,

14:24.366 --> 14:27.133
She vanished from a park,
both parents present.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.802
And then jake wusman,
abducted September 29

14:29.803 --> 14:31.069
From rock creek park.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.738
He was with his entire family.
They were on a picnic.

14:33.739 --> 14:34.839
And then there's--

14:34.840 --> 14:36.374
Sarah.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.510
If you're gonna help us,

14:41.511 --> 14:43.411
I need you to do something for me.

14:43.412 --> 14:45.613
Anything.

14:45.614 --> 14:47.782
Stop drinking.

14:49.284 --> 14:51.618
I can do that. I can do that.

14:54.588 --> 14:57.990
Shouldn't we bring
barbara back here?

14:57.991 --> 15:00.091
No, she's given us all she can.

15:00.092 --> 15:01.726
Let's go through it.

15:01.727 --> 15:04.362
Ok. She was standing
about here, right?

15:04.363 --> 15:06.630
It's crowded. Families all around.

15:06.631 --> 15:09.433
Are you hungry?

15:09.434 --> 15:11.167
Come on. Let's get something.

15:11.168 --> 15:14.070
The unsubs are watching and
waiting for the best target.

15:14.071 --> 15:15.271
[carnival music playing]

15:15.272 --> 15:17.807
I want to ride the spotted one.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.576
Itchy scratchy.

15:21.577 --> 15:22.977
Then she hears it.

15:22.978 --> 15:26.446
Lindsay! Lindsay!

15:26.447 --> 15:29.752
Lindsay! Has anyone
seen my daughter?!

15:29.753 --> 15:33.390
By the time she turns around,
aimee's gone.

15:33.391 --> 15:36.093
The mother who just
cried wolf moves off.

15:36.094 --> 15:38.562
She can hear barbara crying
out for aimee, but...

15:38.563 --> 15:39.930
Hotch: Aimee can't answer

15:39.931 --> 15:42.767
Because the unsub has her
face buried in his chest.

15:42.768 --> 15:45.302
To passersby,
it looked like any parent

15:45.303 --> 15:47.338
Carrying a crying child.

15:47.339 --> 15:50.474
30 seconds later,

15:50.475 --> 15:52.042
She's concealed in the vehicle...

15:53.847 --> 15:54.949
And they're gone.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.384
The same one rolls
up on our mother,

15:56.385 --> 15:57.852
She gets in, it's done.

15:57.853 --> 16:00.320
Who's driving it?

16:03.491 --> 16:06.459
It took 3 unsubs to pull this off.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.760
If the same people took charlie,

16:07.761 --> 16:09.094
We're looking for a group.

16:09.095 --> 16:10.562
Well, if they've taken
2 or more children

16:10.563 --> 16:12.931
Over an 8-year period,
somebody must have noticed something.

16:12.932 --> 16:14.599
How do they keep
the victims hidden?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.934
Once we figure that out,
we'll find them.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.501
The unsubs?

16:18.502 --> 16:20.470
And the children.

16:31.953 --> 16:35.156
[grinding and rattling]

16:40.162 --> 16:41.830
[grinding stops]

16:57.646 --> 17:00.115
Beautiful, aren't they?

17:00.116 --> 17:01.448
Thank you.

17:01.449 --> 17:04.519
I planted each and every
one of them myself.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.220
I like to think of these roses

17:06.221 --> 17:08.990
As the souls of the forgotten.

17:08.991 --> 17:11.593
Like...This poor young man here.

17:29.019 --> 17:30.653
Hotch, uh, this is sarah hillridge.

17:30.654 --> 17:33.821
Oh, we met when charlie was taken.

17:33.822 --> 17:35.723
I mean, you know,
you saw a lot of us.

17:35.724 --> 17:37.358
I'm sure we all look the same.

17:37.359 --> 17:39.760
Thank you for coming in.
Have a seat.

17:40.595 --> 17:42.730
All right, these represent kids

17:42.731 --> 17:44.197
Taken from public places.

17:44.198 --> 17:46.066
Locations are never
hit more than once,

17:46.067 --> 17:47.634
But there is similarity in each.

17:47.635 --> 17:49.970
Different malls, toy stores,

17:49.971 --> 17:52.439
Carnivals, theme parks, parades.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.608
Places where families
should feel safe.

17:54.609 --> 17:56.476
And where there
isn't much security.

17:56.477 --> 17:58.511
That's 12 children over 10 years?

17:58.512 --> 18:00.513
We should interview
all the families.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.615
I know a few of them.

18:01.616 --> 18:02.983
We had a support group.

18:02.984 --> 18:05.352
I mean, most of them have moved on.

18:05.353 --> 18:07.321
But you're here.

18:10.191 --> 18:12.726
I saw charlie 3 years ago.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.696
You didn't tell me that.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.662
Well, my husband didn't believe me.
Why would you?

18:20.663 --> 18:23.229
Tell us what happened.

18:23.230 --> 18:24.795
At first, I saw him all the time.

18:24.796 --> 18:26.863
I thought I did,
and from what I understand,

18:26.864 --> 18:28.331
That's normal.

18:28.332 --> 18:31.200
But you can't survive that way.

18:31.201 --> 18:34.302
So jake and I promised
that we would move on.

18:34.303 --> 18:36.871
But a few years later, I saw him.

18:36.872 --> 18:38.206
I mean, it was different.

18:38.207 --> 18:39.440
I mean, in my mind
he had never aged,

18:39.441 --> 18:41.642
But this was a teenage
charlie crossing the street.

18:41.643 --> 18:43.576
And as quick as he was
there he was gone again,

18:43.577 --> 18:45.244
But I know I saw him.

18:45.245 --> 18:48.381
Jake didn't believe me.

18:48.382 --> 18:50.816
That was the day he left me.

18:50.817 --> 18:53.385
What did you do when
you saw charlie?

18:54.253 --> 18:55.752
I called for him.

18:59.156 --> 19:01.423
Charlie!

19:01.424 --> 19:03.057
Prentiss: How did
you know it was him?

19:03.058 --> 19:04.425
Ohh! [tires screech]

19:04.426 --> 19:06.226
Well, I didn't, not for sure,
so I called for him again.

19:06.227 --> 19:07.694
Charlie!

19:07.695 --> 19:09.163
Prentiss: Did he hear you?

19:09.164 --> 19:10.466
He looked back.

19:10.467 --> 19:11.834
Hotch: And your husband
didn't see him?

19:11.835 --> 19:12.802
Charlie.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.038
It was crowded. He disappeared.

19:15.039 --> 19:18.808
I lost him all over again.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.176
We'll be asking those parents

19:20.177 --> 19:22.943
To sign up for all that pain again.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.644
If they've moved on...

19:24.645 --> 19:28.381
They'd take the chance if it
meant their kids were alive.

19:43.694 --> 19:46.696
Just flare up that
hair a little bit more,

19:46.697 --> 19:49.399
And it went farther down his neck.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.971
. His--his eyebrows
are not quite as full.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.407
Stephen's been missing 7 years?

19:57.408 --> 19:58.941
In February.

19:58.942 --> 20:00.910
He'd be 15 now.

20:00.911 --> 20:04.280
And you last saw him
in the toy section?

20:06.950 --> 20:08.283
That sar hillridge?

20:08.284 --> 20:09.818
Do you know her?

20:09.819 --> 20:11.386
We were friends.

20:11.387 --> 20:13.889
We were in a support
group together.

20:13.890 --> 20:15.624
Stephen was taken the
year after charlie.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.025
You know she's crazy?

20:17.026 --> 20:18.360
Leave her alone.

20:18.361 --> 20:19.461
She is.

20:19.462 --> 20:20.963
No, sir, I don't know that.

20:20.964 --> 20:23.666
Wishing for your boy to
come home is one thing.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.801
She threw her whole life away.

20:25.802 --> 20:27.636
Her husband's a good man,

20:27.637 --> 20:29.538
And she's got a daughter
who she can't even--

20:30.607 --> 20:32.474
Why would she ruin that?

20:32.475 --> 20:34.610
Hope can be paralyzing, sir.

20:34.611 --> 20:37.313
We believe that the people
who took aimee lynch

20:37.314 --> 20:39.515
Have been doing this
for a very long time.

20:39.516 --> 20:42.284
The little girl yesterday?

20:42.285 --> 20:43.752
In the moments before
your son was taken,

20:43.753 --> 20:46.154
Did anything stand out?

20:46.155 --> 20:47.655
Like what?

20:47.656 --> 20:50.258
Anything at all that drew
your attention away from him?

20:51.626 --> 20:53.327
Just for a moment,

20:53.328 --> 20:55.896
But I never thought anything
about it. That woman.

20:55.897 --> 20:57.865
Looking for her son.

20:57.866 --> 20:59.332
I helped her.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.001
Oh, god.

21:03.003 --> 21:04.971
She even thanked me for helping.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.305
You couldn't have known.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.307
She was right in front of me.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.308
How could she have taken stephen?

21:08.309 --> 21:10.076
Because she's not working alone.

21:10.077 --> 21:13.713
They've used this ruse in
a dozen local abductions.

21:15.616 --> 21:17.083
Is that why we're here?

21:20.387 --> 21:22.088
They've done this to all of us?

21:22.089 --> 21:25.591
Do you think there's a
chance stephen's still alive?

21:38.439 --> 21:39.940
How many are there?

21:39.941 --> 21:41.741
You're the fourth.

21:41.742 --> 21:44.277
But there have been others.

21:44.278 --> 21:46.012
Where are they?

21:46.013 --> 21:47.946
Someplace better.

21:49.082 --> 21:51.282
They're gonna get us for supper.

21:51.283 --> 21:53.984
But I'm not hungry.

21:53.985 --> 21:57.421
What's your favorite food?

21:57.422 --> 21:59.055
Ice cream?

22:01.558 --> 22:03.225
Pretend it's ice cream

22:03.226 --> 22:04.894
And eat it all up.

22:04.895 --> 22:06.295
Ok?

22:06.296 --> 22:09.497
I want my mommy.

22:25.121 --> 22:26.922
You're in good hands.

22:26.923 --> 22:28.990
There's no one better than them.

22:28.991 --> 22:31.226
I know.

22:36.766 --> 22:39.401
I let go of her hand.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.038
It was only for a second,

22:44.039 --> 22:47.308
But she's always been the
one that I worried about.

22:47.309 --> 22:49.009
You can't blame yourself.

22:49.010 --> 22:50.310
Frank does.

22:50.311 --> 22:53.481
And he's right.
I should have held on.

22:56.152 --> 23:00.421
Aimee's wandered off before, and...

23:00.422 --> 23:05.825
There's this feeling when
they're out of your sight.

23:05.826 --> 23:09.595
It takes your breath away
until you see them again.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.696
[gasps]

23:10.697 --> 23:13.565
And I think that's
why I can't breathe.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.801
[gasps and sobs]

23:18.137 --> 23:20.038
11 families have
confirmed the same woman,

23:20.039 --> 23:22.175
40 to 50 years old,
calling for children.

23:22.176 --> 23:24.544
In some cases,
she even had a child with her.

23:24.545 --> 23:26.613
She actually used the
kids for the abductions?

23:26.614 --> 23:29.149
Were they her own or
the ones kidnapped?

23:29.150 --> 23:32.018
Prentiss: We don't
believe she's a mother.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.487
Most predisposed female
offenders are not.

23:34.488 --> 23:36.622
But they are the most violent.

23:38.459 --> 23:41.227
Y-you said that she's
working with someone?

23:41.228 --> 23:43.496
It's likely a subservient male.

23:43.497 --> 23:46.032
But the woman separates
herself from her partners.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.969
She chooses the victim while
they do the riskiest part--

23:48.970 --> 23:50.804
They grab the child and
manage the getaway.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.340
This is what he looks
like as a teenager.

23:53.341 --> 23:55.675
Um--um, he's tall and thin.

23:55.676 --> 23:58.576
His hair is, um,
darker than it was.

23:58.577 --> 24:00.211
But--but that's him.

24:00.212 --> 24:02.747
That's--that's charlie.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.517
Why would they take the risk

24:05.518 --> 24:07.219
Of letting him out in the world?

24:07.220 --> 24:09.521
They've had him under
their control for 8 years.

24:09.522 --> 24:12.024
He's either got stockholm
or he's being threatened.

24:12.025 --> 24:13.759
"get us another kid,

24:13.760 --> 24:16.762
And we won't kill you."

24:18.031 --> 24:19.731
Jj: Sarah...

24:19.732 --> 24:21.233
Let's take a break, ok?

24:21.234 --> 24:23.702
Ok. Ok.

24:23.703 --> 24:26.038
Thank you. Thank you.

24:28.775 --> 24:30.709
All right.

24:30.710 --> 24:34.446
So living and working
in northern virginia.

24:34.447 --> 24:36.711
It's most likely in isolation.

24:36.712 --> 24:38.546
I mean, there's no way to
explain a houseful of kids

24:38.547 --> 24:40.045
At the neighborhood block party.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.010
Managing this many
children isn't easy.

24:42.011 --> 24:44.874
There have to be incidents where
things didn't go as planned.

24:44.875 --> 24:47.142
We should start with domestic
calls and disturbances.

24:47.143 --> 24:49.644
Concentrate on families who
were visited by social services.

24:49.645 --> 24:52.046
I'll get garcia.

24:52.047 --> 24:54.881
It's likely these unsubs
were questioned before.

24:54.882 --> 24:58.418
Once we narrow down garcia's list,
we should revisit them.

24:58.419 --> 25:01.454
What they've been doing to
charlie this whole time,

25:01.455 --> 25:03.822
Oh, there were times that
I had hoped he was dead

25:03.823 --> 25:06.691
Just so he wouldn't
suffer every day.

25:06.692 --> 25:10.428
We know these offenders
are skilled at abductions

25:10.429 --> 25:11.929
And hiding their victims.

25:11.930 --> 25:15.999
Usually, we don't know
that until after the fact.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.336
What you've brought us,
to them, is rare.

25:20.337 --> 25:24.306
I know, but it's not gonna
end well for all of us.

25:25.508 --> 25:28.642
I recognize him. He was there.

25:28.643 --> 25:29.944
When we were in line.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.912
He was too old for the ponies.
I should have known that.

25:31.913 --> 25:33.013
He was a few people behind us.

25:33.014 --> 25:34.214
You saw him, too.

25:34.215 --> 25:35.681
Yeah. He seemed like a normal kid.

25:35.682 --> 25:37.283
He's still alive.

25:37.284 --> 25:39.518
Wait, this is your son?

25:39.519 --> 25:41.252
Charlie.

25:41.253 --> 25:43.287
Your son took my baby?

25:43.288 --> 25:45.189
Jj: Mrs. Lynch-
your son took aimee?

25:45.190 --> 25:46.356
Honey, come on.

25:46.357 --> 25:47.891
He's--he's one of them.

25:47.892 --> 25:49.559
He's taking innocent children.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.328
Aimee is 8 years old.
She can't defend herself.

25:52.329 --> 25:53.829
And he knew that!

25:53.830 --> 25:55.130
He watched her!

25:55.131 --> 25:57.465
He's as bad as the rest of them.

26:01.069 --> 26:03.102
She's right.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.571
No, no, no. Charlie
didn't have a choice.

26:05.572 --> 26:07.205
He's one of them now.
How is he ever going to forgethat?

26:07.206 --> 26:10.076
He's just trying to survive.

26:12.646 --> 26:14.680
Ok.

26:14.681 --> 26:16.749
My god.

26:23.022 --> 26:25.457
Please stay with me.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.025
She'll check on you.

26:27.026 --> 26:29.194
Please.

26:30.029 --> 26:32.096
Just for a minute.

26:40.372 --> 26:42.940
[door opens]

26:44.342 --> 26:46.210
Hey.

26:46.211 --> 26:48.279
Who let you in here?

26:48.280 --> 26:50.681
Please, take me. Don't hurt her.

26:54.152 --> 26:55.553
Uh

26:57.823 --> 27:00.191
Please don't leave me.

27:34.004 --> 27:35.971
Ok, there are 107 families

27:35.972 --> 27:38.305
Visited by social services
in the last 10 years.

27:38.306 --> 27:39.839
That's too many to go door to door.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.107
We're gonna have to
narrow that down.

27:41.108 --> 27:42.842
We need to figure out
why they're staying

27:42.843 --> 27:44.176
In northern virginia.

27:44.177 --> 27:45.644
Their work could be the key.

27:45.645 --> 27:48.980
They could have a child-care
facility on the premises as a cover.

27:48.981 --> 27:50.815
You know, it's most likely
a single income family.

27:50.816 --> 27:52.283
Someone has to be home
to stay with the kids.

27:52.284 --> 27:53.284
Ok, all this helps.

27:53.285 --> 27:55.052
They've been questioned before,

27:55.053 --> 27:57.221
So we can expect a
rehearsed response.

27:57.222 --> 27:59.056
How many on that list
are single income?

27:59.057 --> 28:00.324
23.

28:01.660 --> 28:03.060
What's the problem?

28:03.061 --> 28:04.729
We're gonna be knocking on
the doors of 23 families

28:04.730 --> 28:07.365
And all of them have done
something bad to a kid.

28:07.366 --> 28:08.900
We don't have a warrant.

28:08.901 --> 28:11.135
Just our profile.

28:11.136 --> 28:12.737
If we get it wrong
and leave that house,

28:12.738 --> 28:15.240
They'll destroy any evidence they have,
including the children.

28:19.011 --> 28:21.446
Jj, get an article
of aimee's clothing.

28:22.848 --> 28:24.715
What for?

28:25.984 --> 28:28.385
It's for the dogs.

28:34.622 --> 28:36.055
Frank: Leave it alone.

28:36.056 --> 28:37.056
No, I can't.

28:37.057 --> 28:38.925
Yes, you can.

28:40.595 --> 28:43.163
8 years?

28:44.966 --> 28:46.566
There's a moment

28:46.567 --> 28:49.903
In the morning,
just as I wake up...

28:49.904 --> 28:52.638
Where there's a
split-second of peace.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.109
And then, it all comes back.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.011
All of it.

29:00.314 --> 29:02.882
Yeah. I haven't slept yet.

29:02.883 --> 29:06.116
I hope you get her back
before you need to.

29:08.752 --> 29:11.550
If you didn't believe
for all those years

29:11.551 --> 29:13.616
That your son was still alive,

29:13.617 --> 29:15.817
None of us would be here now.

29:15.818 --> 29:18.116
I would have felt if he was gone.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.886
I need an item of aimee's clothing.

29:24.887 --> 29:26.420
Frank: Why?

29:28.287 --> 29:30.956
She--she never put it back on.

29:32.458 --> 29:33.625
Thank you.

29:41.801 --> 29:43.735
Mr. Jenkins, we're with the fbi.

29:43.736 --> 29:46.737
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

29:49.107 --> 29:52.075
We're going door to door.
You must be our-- what do you think?

29:52.076 --> 29:53.376
40th, 50th door, I don't know.

29:53.377 --> 29:55.978
Do you mind if we come in?

29:57.347 --> 30:00.015
Hotch: Mr. Hayden,
how many children do you have?

30:01.183 --> 30:04.251
5...One on the way.

30:04.252 --> 30:06.153
And where are they now?

30:09.991 --> 30:12.092
Mr. Hayden.

30:12.093 --> 30:13.993
I'm sorry?

30:13.994 --> 30:16.195
I said, you've got
a lot of land here.

30:18.532 --> 30:20.065
And a houseful of kids.

30:20.066 --> 30:22.834
Yes, I do.

30:24.536 --> 30:27.371
It's awfully quiet.

30:27.372 --> 30:28.806
Are they out?

30:28.807 --> 30:30.373
My wife took them out.

30:30.374 --> 30:32.075
At the winter festival?

30:32.076 --> 30:33.843
Winter festival?

30:35.545 --> 30:36.779
In ashburn.

30:36.780 --> 30:41.115
No. Uh, but that's
a wonderful idea.

30:41.116 --> 30:42.483
I'll mention that to my wife.

30:42.484 --> 30:44.117
Might be nice for the kids.

30:44.118 --> 30:45.719
They have pony rides.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.754
Oh, great.

30:48.655 --> 30:51.990
So, uh, do the kids
take after your wife?

30:51.991 --> 30:53.491
Some say they do.

30:53.492 --> 30:56.727
Uh...How can I help you?

30:56.728 --> 30:58.795
Oh, we were actually hoping
that your wife would be here.

30:58.796 --> 31:00.930
Do you know when she'll be back?

31:00.931 --> 31:03.599
She's got the kids
out on a field trip.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.935
Shh. If you make a sound,

31:06.936 --> 31:08.536
I'll kill your mommy.

31:08.537 --> 31:09.704
[indistinct chattering]

31:09.705 --> 31:11.238
Do you understand me?

31:12.840 --> 31:14.307
Come over here.

31:14.308 --> 31:16.208
[indistinct chattering continues]

31:18.444 --> 31:20.180
Clean out your room.

31:20.181 --> 31:21.649
Now.

31:32.659 --> 31:35.193
Uh, I can get her back here.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.162
Please. If you don't mind.

31:38.498 --> 31:40.332
I need to step outside.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.533
Excuse me.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.674
Why don't you go on ahead and, uh,

31:49.675 --> 31:52.877
Make that phone call.

31:56.781 --> 31:57.981
Hotch?

31:57.982 --> 31:59.382
What have you got?

31:59.383 --> 32:01.350
We are at 2150 mosley lane.

32:01.351 --> 32:04.153
Only the husband is here.
Roger roycewood.

32:04.154 --> 32:05.154
Wife and kids?

32:05.155 --> 32:06.254
Yeah. Out.

32:06.255 --> 32:08.222
He matches the profile?

32:08.223 --> 32:09.557
So does the property.

32:09.558 --> 32:11.792
It's isolated. You can't
see it from the street.

32:11.793 --> 32:14.094
They have extra locks on the doors.

32:14.095 --> 32:15.995
There's a minivan in the driveway

32:15.996 --> 32:19.098
And a photo of a boy who
looks a lot like charlie.

32:19.099 --> 32:20.465
Is he onto you?

32:20.466 --> 32:22.500
Without a doubt.

32:22.501 --> 32:23.501
We're on our way.

32:23.502 --> 32:24.603
Rossi: Search warrant?

32:24.604 --> 32:26.105
And dogs. If the kids
are anywhere near

32:26.106 --> 32:27.740
Or in the house, we'll find them.

32:28.975 --> 32:31.645
Uh, voicemail again.

32:33.749 --> 32:36.317
I suppose y'all could
come back later.

32:36.318 --> 32:39.619
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

32:49.161 --> 32:51.828
Ok, let's go. Shh. Keep quiet.

32:53.397 --> 32:55.731
Where's stephen? She took him away.

32:55.732 --> 32:58.567
Is that because he wouldn't
go to the carnival?

32:58.568 --> 33:01.770
I said you'd see him. Get in there.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.439
Shh.

33:43.603 --> 33:46.570
How far do you want this
tape to go around the back?

33:46.571 --> 33:48.704
[continues indistinctly]

33:48.705 --> 33:51.807
I guess you got your warrant.

33:51.808 --> 33:54.943
And ground-penetrating radar.

33:54.944 --> 33:57.747
We will find where you buried them.

33:58.618 --> 34:00.588
Will that hurt the roses?

34:02.328 --> 34:05.133
The radar?

34:07.804 --> 34:09.471
Officer.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.918
Security camera on the front door.

34:30.893 --> 34:32.159
What?

34:32.161 --> 34:34.163
It's a hinge.

34:43.071 --> 34:46.139
Let's get the dogs down here.

34:49.009 --> 34:50.543
Give me that sack.

34:56.451 --> 34:59.486
What is this place?

34:59.487 --> 35:01.288
I don't know.

35:09.831 --> 35:12.699
What's that?

35:12.700 --> 35:16.869
[squeaking] [gas hissing]

35:29.847 --> 35:31.780
Rossi: Is that aimee lynch?

35:31.781 --> 35:33.783
They dyed her hair.

35:38.323 --> 35:40.792
There's none of charlie.

35:41.694 --> 35:43.795
He probably took these pictures.

35:43.796 --> 35:45.197
For what?

35:47.567 --> 35:49.703
Proof.

35:51.106 --> 35:52.808
What about their work?
We thought it could be tied

35:52.809 --> 35:54.243
To what they do for a living.

35:54.244 --> 35:56.578
Employment records,
taxes, it's all legit.

35:56.579 --> 35:58.581
Roger's an electrician,
has been since forever.

35:58.582 --> 35:59.648
What about the wife?

35:59.649 --> 36:01.583
Looks like she stays at home.

36:01.584 --> 36:03.552
I'm crossing these same
records with her maiden name,

36:03.553 --> 36:06.188
Anita weld roycewood.
I don't think I'm gonna find anything.

36:06.189 --> 36:08.290
And I'm rarely wrong, so--

36:08.291 --> 36:09.925
I'm wrong.

36:09.926 --> 36:11.894
Her family owns a funeral
home in leesburg.

36:11.895 --> 36:13.362
You're less than
10 minutes from it.

36:13.363 --> 36:14.763
Oh, god. The funeral home's
been in the weld family

36:14.764 --> 36:16.331
Since she was a little girl.

36:16.332 --> 36:19.168
Hearses, coffins, vans,
a million ways to hide the children.

36:19.169 --> 36:20.669
We can't dig up 10
years of coffins.

36:20.670 --> 36:21.970
Reid: You might not have to.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.604
They have a crematorium.

36:39.858 --> 36:42.759
[anita humming "mockingbird"]

36:45.763 --> 36:47.497
What are we doing here?

36:47.498 --> 36:49.499
What's happening?

36:51.502 --> 36:52.936
[humming]

36:52.937 --> 36:54.871
Put her in there.

36:55.973 --> 36:58.842
Put her in there!

37:09.620 --> 37:12.188
No, no...

37:17.127 --> 37:22.031
No, no, no, no...

37:22.032 --> 37:26.501
Oh, no, no, no...

37:26.502 --> 37:27.969
Shut her up.

37:27.970 --> 37:28.971
No!

37:28.972 --> 37:30.406
Did you hear me?

37:32.843 --> 37:34.510
Oh, no...

37:34.511 --> 37:36.812
Shh.

37:36.813 --> 37:37.913
Come here. Come here.

37:37.914 --> 37:40.815
Come on.

37:40.816 --> 37:41.816
Come on over here, now.

37:41.817 --> 37:43.784
Just be mama's big girl, ok?

37:43.785 --> 37:44.785
No...

37:44.786 --> 37:45.787
It's all right.

37:45.788 --> 37:47.991
No, no! No!

37:47.992 --> 37:50.060
Come here. Come on.

37:50.895 --> 37:52.562
Let her go!

37:56.534 --> 37:59.903
[laughs] come on,
you gotta be kidding--

38:15.986 --> 38:19.522
She can't hurt us anymore.

38:31.401 --> 38:33.802
All right. Thanks.

38:33.803 --> 38:35.771
They found the kids.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.573
Time to arrest roger roycewood.

38:37.574 --> 38:39.008
Who gets the honors?

38:39.009 --> 38:40.577
Where is he? In the bathroom.

38:58.096 --> 38:59.463
How are you doing?

38:59.464 --> 39:01.164
Honestly, I'm terrified.

39:01.165 --> 39:02.632
I've waited 8 years.

39:02.633 --> 39:04.234
What if he doesn't know me?

39:04.235 --> 39:06.303
How long have you been
doing this, dr. Reid?

39:06.304 --> 39:08.806
5 years, 7 months, and 19 days.

39:08.807 --> 39:11.142
In your experience,
what normally happens?

39:11.143 --> 39:13.044
Charlie was 8 when he was taken,

39:13.045 --> 39:16.080
Which means developmentally,
he was in middle childhood.

39:16.081 --> 39:17.713
He had a stronger sense
of right and wrong

39:17.714 --> 39:19.948
And a growing understanding
of his place in the world.

39:19.949 --> 39:23.818
Mentally, he had the ability to talk
about his thoughts and feelings,

39:23.819 --> 39:26.887
While have less focus on himself
and more concern for others.

39:26.888 --> 39:30.056
So you think he's gonna be ok?

39:30.057 --> 39:33.125
With a mother like
you who did all this,

39:33.126 --> 39:34.493
I do.

39:34.494 --> 39:37.562
I'm a doctor.
I put my faith in facts

39:37.563 --> 39:39.363
And statistical probabilities,

39:39.364 --> 39:40.998
But today,

39:40.999 --> 39:43.467
8 parents are gonna have closure.

39:43.468 --> 39:46.403
3 children are going
home with their families,

39:46.404 --> 39:49.907
All because you believed
your son was alive.

39:51.142 --> 39:54.011
That's as close to a
miracle as I've ever seen.

39:55.346 --> 39:57.281
Thank you.

40:00.718 --> 40:02.786
Hey. Hey.

40:05.523 --> 40:07.190
We heard they're on their way back,

40:07.191 --> 40:09.125
But we don't know if
stephen's with them.

40:09.126 --> 40:11.828
[elevator door opens] ohh...

40:14.399 --> 40:15.400
Jake.

40:15.401 --> 40:17.501
Thanks for calling.

40:17.502 --> 40:20.336
You, uh, need to thank her.

40:24.873 --> 40:26.708
You look so happy.

40:27.876 --> 40:30.844
You found him.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.412
You did it.

40:34.482 --> 40:37.517
[elevator bell rings
and door opens]

40:49.063 --> 40:51.665
Charlie?

40:51.666 --> 40:53.399
Mom.

40:54.235 --> 40:56.368
Charlie.

41:43.814 --> 41:45.716
I knew stephen.

41:46.584 --> 41:49.319
He was like a brother to me.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.921
Did he remember us?

41:50.922 --> 41:53.357
You didn't doubt that, did you?

41:53.358 --> 41:55.992
Remembering you was the
only way we survived.

41:55.993 --> 41:58.929
How old was stephen when--

41:59.931 --> 42:01.932
When he died?

42:01.933 --> 42:05.134
He died protecting
that little girl.

42:05.135 --> 42:06.602
Oh, god.

42:10.872 --> 42:14.142
He was alive yesterday?

42:18.481 --> 42:20.816
No...No...

42:23.554 --> 42:27.924
[sobbing]

42:32.893 --> 42:35.727
I have been trying to
think of something to say,

42:35.728 --> 42:39.030
And thank you just
doesn't even come close.

42:39.031 --> 42:40.565
You don't have to thank us.

42:40.566 --> 42:41.599
Yes, I do.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.866
Do you know how long it's been

42:42.867 --> 42:44.801
Since someone believed in me?

42:47.137 --> 42:50.839
You are just
surrounded by darkness.

42:50.840 --> 42:52.474
Why do you do it?

42:55.944 --> 42:57.811
Because of days like this.
