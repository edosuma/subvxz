WEBVTT

00:22.715 --> 00:24.993
IS THIS THE WAY YOU
TREAT EVERY DRIVERWITH A BUSTED
HEADLIGHT?

00:25.093 --> 00:26.077
NO. JUST THE ONES
WITHOUT I.D.

00:26.177 --> 00:28.665
NOW, I'VE CONVINCED LOPEZ
NOT TO CITE YOU,

00:28.765 --> 00:30.460
BUT NO MORE DRIVING
WITHOUT A LICENSE.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.171
AM I FREE TO GO?

00:33.272 --> 00:34.298
YEAH.

00:34.398 --> 00:35.300
FINALLY.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.384
FINALLY?

00:36.484 --> 00:37.428
I MEAN, THANKS.

00:37.528 --> 00:38.764
FINALLY?

00:38.864 --> 00:39.846
YOU THINK
I NEED THIS?

00:39.946 --> 00:41.684
YOU SEE
THIS ASSIGNMENT BOARD?

00:41.784 --> 00:43.061
IT'S FULL OF CASES.

00:43.161 --> 00:45.272
OPEN CASES THAT
I SHOULD BE WORKING ON.

00:45.372 --> 00:47.317
INSTEAD, I'M CLEANING UP
AFTER YOUR MESS.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.528
HEY, I DON'T LIKE IT
EITHER.

00:49.628 --> 00:51.083
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
I HAVE TO CLEAN UP
AFTER THE SISTERS' MESSES.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.116
I'M JUST
TRYIN' TO FIT IN
AS A HUMAN HERE.

00:53.216 --> 00:55.746
DOES ANYBODY EVER SAY,
"THANK YOU, DARRYL"?

00:55.846 --> 00:57.426
I CAN'T EVEN GO TO THE
GROCERY STORE WITHOUT
GETTING ARRESTED.

00:57.436 --> 00:59.350
IT REALLY SUCKS!
IT JUST SUCKS!

01:00.519 --> 01:01.562
YOU GOOD?

01:03.981 --> 01:04.882
YEAH.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.135
ME, TOO.

01:06.235 --> 01:07.738
OK.

01:07.986 --> 01:09.989
OH, MY GOD, COLE.

01:11.326 --> 01:12.893
HOW'S MY CAR?

01:12.994 --> 01:14.856
OH, IT'S FINE.

01:14.956 --> 01:16.818
THAT WAS THE FIRST
AND THE LAST TIME

01:16.918 --> 01:18.444
YOU BORROW MY CAR.
GOT IT? GOOD.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.255
LET'S GO.

01:24.846 --> 01:28.751
BEING HUMAN WAS SUPPOSED
TO MAKE MY LIFE EASIER.

01:28.851 --> 01:30.796
INSTEAD, IT'S GETTING
WORSE BY THE MINUTE.

01:30.896 --> 01:31.921
YEAH, I KNOW
THE FEELING.

01:32.021 --> 01:33.758
I SWEAR, PHOEBE WAS
CLOSER TO MARRYING ME
WHEN I WAS STILL A DEMON.

01:33.858 --> 01:36.178
WELL, TO BE HONEST, COLE.
GETTING BUSTED BY THE COPS

01:36.278 --> 01:38.473
IS NOT THE BEST WAY
TO WIN HER OVER.

01:38.573 --> 01:39.933
OH, PIPER. GOSH.
I'M SURE COLE

01:40.033 --> 01:41.935
ALREADY FEELS
LIKE A BIG
ENOUGH LOSER.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.439
I KNOW I WOULD.

01:43.539 --> 01:44.441
OH, THANKS A LOT.

01:44.541 --> 01:45.776
[CRASH]

01:45.876 --> 01:47.042
OH, GOD.

01:52.301 --> 01:55.832
IT'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

01:55.932 --> 01:57.893
COME ON.

02:00.772 --> 02:01.062
IT'S STUCK.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.070
PAIGE!

02:10.786 --> 02:14.584
CAREFUL. HURRY,
BEFORE ANYONE SEES US!

02:28.770 --> 02:32.050
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

02:32.150 --> 02:33.569
PAIGE!

02:52.013 --> 02:55.291
âª I AM THE SON âª

02:55.391 --> 02:58.104
âª AND THE HEIR âª

02:58.897 --> 03:01.275
âª I AM HUMAN,
AND I NEED TO BE LOVED âª

03:04.822 --> 03:08.619
âª JUST LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES âª

03:13.627 --> 03:17.006
âª SEE, I'VE ALREADY
WAITED TOO LONG âª

03:19.510 --> 03:23.180
âª AND ALL MY HOPE IS GONE âª

03:35.032 --> 03:38.645
COLE, WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO VAGUE?

03:38.746 --> 03:40.231
I ONLY ASKED YOU
WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

03:40.331 --> 03:42.107
AND I TOLD YOU,
I'M GOING TO GET A LIFE.

03:42.207 --> 03:44.110
SEE, NOW THAT'S
THE VAGUE PART
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

03:44.210 --> 03:46.449
THE LAST TIME
YOU LEFT LIKE THIS,

03:46.549 --> 03:48.409
YOU WENT OUT
AND GOT A GUN.

03:48.510 --> 03:49.996
I'M NOT GETTING A GUN.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.539
[SIGHS] OK.
THEN, PLEASE,

03:51.639 --> 03:54.627
TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG.

03:54.727 --> 03:56.127
IT'S JUST...

03:56.228 --> 03:58.007
I NEED ACTION.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.132
I KIND OF THOUGHT
WE WERE DOIN' OK

03:59.232 --> 04:01.135
IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

04:01.235 --> 04:02.304
NOT THAT KIND
OF ACTION, PHOEBE.

04:02.404 --> 04:04.139
I WENT FROM
ALL-POWERFUL DEMON
TO MERE MORTAL OVERNIGHT.

04:04.239 --> 04:07.143
YOU ARE NOT MERE.

04:07.243 --> 04:08.145
BABY, YOU ARE
ANYTHING BUT MERE.

04:08.245 --> 04:10.733
NEXT TO THE CHARMED ONES,
I'M A POTTED PLANT.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.486
BUT LAST NIGHT,
PULLING THAT WOMAN
OUT OF THAT CAR

04:12.586 --> 04:15.281
FELT SO GOOD.

04:15.381 --> 04:16.742
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

04:16.841 --> 04:18.548
WELL, I WON'T LAST AS ONE
WITHOUT A REASON TO GET UP
IN THE MORNING.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.915
YOU HAVE ME.

04:21.015 --> 04:23.085
I'M A REASON.

04:23.185 --> 04:24.268
THAT'S ALL I HAVE,
PHOEBE...

04:24.561 --> 04:26.271
AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I HAVE THAT.

04:31.529 --> 04:35.202
AM I THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST BITCH
OR WHAT?

04:35.619 --> 04:38.982
NAH, TOO EASY.

04:39.082 --> 04:40.944
COLE VANQUISHED
HIS DEMON HALF.

04:41.044 --> 04:43.279
HE GAVE UP
EVERYTHING HE HAS
EVER KNOWN FOR ME,

04:43.379 --> 04:46.493
AND I CAN'T MUSTER
UP A SIMPLE "YES"
TO MARRIAGE.

04:46.593 --> 04:49.497
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
THE MARRYING TYPE.

04:49.597 --> 04:52.376
OR SO YOU KEEP
TELLING YOURSELF.

04:52.476 --> 04:54.839
BUT YOU THINK I AM?

04:54.939 --> 04:55.965
I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID.

04:56.065 --> 04:59.095
OH. OF WHAT?

04:59.195 --> 05:00.888
COLE'S HUMANITY.

05:00.988 --> 05:02.443
HE WAS ACTUALLY
A MUCH SAFER BOYFRIEND
WHEN HE WAS A DEMON,

05:02.454 --> 05:05.103
EVEN THOUGH HE COULD
RIP YOUR THROAT OUT
WITH HIS TEETH.

05:05.203 --> 05:08.231
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
THAT TO ME?

05:08.331 --> 05:09.609
WELL, ON SOME LEVEL,

05:09.709 --> 05:12.113
YOU KNEW THAT
IT COULDN'T LAST--
A DEMON AND A WITCH.

05:12.213 --> 05:14.616
BUT NOW THAT
COLE IS A HUMAN,

05:14.716 --> 05:17.746
THE SAFETY NET'S GONE,

05:17.847 --> 05:19.081
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

05:19.181 --> 05:20.876
THE FUTURE
LIES IN YOUR HANDS.

05:20.976 --> 05:22.795
YEAH. OK, I DON'T
WANT TO ANALYZE ME
ANYMORE.

05:22.895 --> 05:26.550
LET'S TRY
SOMEBODY ELSE.

05:26.650 --> 05:28.260
HOW'S PAIGE FEELING
THIS MORNING?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.889
NO IDEA.

05:29.989 --> 05:31.141
SHE FLEW OUT THE DOOR
THIS MORNING

05:31.241 --> 05:32.726
LIKE NOTHIN' HAPPENED.

05:32.826 --> 05:34.268
SO WE STILL
DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE FROZE UP?

05:34.368 --> 05:36.606
NOPE.

05:36.707 --> 05:38.274
THAT IS SO WEIRD.

05:38.374 --> 05:39.275
I MEAN, SHE CAN
HANDLE DEMONS NOW,

05:39.375 --> 05:41.279
BUT SHE CAN'T HANDLE
A CAR WRECK?

05:41.379 --> 05:43.216
YEAH, IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

05:43.549 --> 05:45.510
[CLEARS THROAT]

05:47.054 --> 05:49.500
UM, IF YOU PUT
YOUR NOSE ANY DEEPER
INTO THAT COFFEE CUP,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.293
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A SNORKEL.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.422
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

05:53.522 --> 05:54.941
PAIGE TOLD ME SOMETHING
IN CONFIDENCE.

05:56.067 --> 05:59.304
OK, BUT IT'S KIND OF
A DANGEROUS TIME FOR US.

05:59.404 --> 06:02.519
IF SHE FREEZES UP AGAIN
AT THE WRONG MOMENT,

06:02.619 --> 06:05.205
ARE YOU GONNA BE SORRY
YOU DIDN'T TELL US?

06:07.042 --> 06:08.001
PAIGE'S PARENTS DIED
IN A CAR WRECK.

06:10.796 --> 06:13.785
OH, MY GOD.

06:13.885 --> 06:14.953
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

06:15.054 --> 06:16.413
ABOUT 8 YEARS AGO
WHEN SHE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

06:16.513 --> 06:19.042
SHE NEVER REALLY
DEALT WITH IT.

06:19.142 --> 06:21.296
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

06:21.396 --> 06:22.547
HOW DO YOU DEAL
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

06:22.647 --> 06:24.440
PLUS SHE WAS A TEENAGER
AND ALL ALONE.

06:25.441 --> 06:29.366
SO MAYBE
WE COULD HELP HER
DEAL WITH IT.

06:32.411 --> 06:33.205
NO, I'M NOT FAMILY.

06:35.749 --> 06:38.237
I'M FROM
SOCIAL SERVICES.

06:38.337 --> 06:40.589
I WAS JUST CALLING
TO SEE HOW SHE WAS
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

06:42.466 --> 06:45.580
THANK GOD.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.374
OK. I'LL JUST CALL BACK

06:47.474 --> 06:49.295
AND CHECK IN ON HER.

06:49.395 --> 06:52.148
THANK YOU.

06:54.944 --> 06:58.389
HI. GOT A MINUTE?

06:58.489 --> 07:00.034
NO. I'M BUSY, GUYS.

07:01.370 --> 07:02.980
UH, WE JUST
WANT TO TALK.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.397
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.

07:04.497 --> 07:05.567
YEAH? SO'S MY WORK.
MAYBE LATER.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.737
PAIGE, IT'S ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

07:07.837 --> 07:09.740
NOT RIGHT NOW.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.825
PAIGE,
WE'RE YOUR SISTERS.

07:10.925 --> 07:11.968
I SAID NOT NOW!

07:16.766 --> 07:19.963
PAIGE.

07:20.063 --> 07:21.983
WE KNOW
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.528
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
AND WE WANT YOU TO KNOW

07:26.697 --> 07:28.432
THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.535
AND WE'RE HERE
FOR YOU.

07:31.537 --> 07:32.247
FINE, BUT JUST...

07:35.084 --> 07:37.279
NOT HERE, OK?
I'LL JUST...

07:37.380 --> 07:39.448
TELL MY BOSS
I HAVE TO LEAVE.

07:39.548 --> 07:41.551
WE'LL TALK AT HOME.

07:51.565 --> 07:54.720
GOT A MINUTE?

07:54.821 --> 07:55.806
WHATEVER IT IS, NO.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.059
YOU SEE
THIS ASSIGNMENT BOARD?

07:58.159 --> 07:59.476
WELL,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

07:59.576 --> 08:00.949
IF YOU'VE GOT
SUCH A HEAVY CASELOAD,
LET ME HELP YOU.

08:00.959 --> 08:03.442
OH, YOU WANT
TO HELP?
YEAH.

08:03.542 --> 08:04.735
GREAT. WELL,
YOU CAN HELP ME

08:04.835 --> 08:06.254
BY FOLLOWING THAT
LITTLE EXIT SIGN.

08:07.798 --> 08:11.493
THAT'S IT.
YOU WANNA FIGHT?

08:11.594 --> 08:13.123
BECAUSE WITHOUT
THE ABILITY TO THROW
ENERGY BALLS,

08:13.223 --> 08:15.084
I THINK
I CAN TAKE YOU.

08:15.184 --> 08:16.597
LOOK, JUST RELAX, ALL RIGHT?
I NEED TO GET BACK
IN THE GAME.

08:16.607 --> 08:20.091
WHAT GAME?

08:20.191 --> 08:21.427
THE GOOD-VERSUS-EVIL GAME.
IT'S ALL I KNOW.

08:21.527 --> 08:24.512
OH, WOW.

08:24.612 --> 08:26.183
YOU WANT
TO BE A COP?

08:26.283 --> 08:28.395
I WORKED FOR
THE D.A's OFFICE,
I KNOW THE LAW,

08:28.495 --> 08:30.605
I'M A FORMER DEMON.
I KNOW THE STREETS.

08:30.705 --> 08:33.109
YOU WANT
TO BE A COP?

08:33.210 --> 08:34.527
I WANT TO HELP
WITH YOUR INVESTIGATIONS.

08:34.626 --> 08:36.030
AS A COP?

08:36.131 --> 08:37.032
ON MY OWN.

08:37.131 --> 08:38.532
OF COURSE,
THE D.A. INVESTIGATORS
ARE STILL AFTER ME,

08:38.631 --> 08:40.619
BUT YOU COULD CLOSE
THAT CASE, CLEAR MY NAME,
GET MY IDENTITY BACK--

08:40.719 --> 08:43.416
NO! NO! NO!

08:43.515 --> 08:44.959
NOW YOU'RE
TALKING CRAZY.

08:45.060 --> 08:46.336
NO. WHAT'S CRAZY

08:46.437 --> 08:47.851
IS ME SITTING AROUND
THE MANOR ALL DAY
WITH NOTHING TO DO.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.092
ALL I GOT IN MY HEAD,

08:50.192 --> 08:52.888
ALL I COULD DO WITH IT,
GOING TO WASTE.
NOW <i>THAT</i> IS CRAZY.

08:52.988 --> 08:54.949
CAPTAIN.

08:56.326 --> 08:57.853
MIND IF I GET
MY OFFICE BACK?

08:57.953 --> 09:00.023
NO. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.859
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

09:01.959 --> 09:05.046
EXCUSE ME.

09:06.507 --> 09:10.455
SO I WASN'T THE IDEAL
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, YOU KNOW?

09:10.555 --> 09:13.583
I, UM, SKIPPED CLASSES,

09:13.683 --> 09:16.587
PARTIED ALL NIGHT
WITH MY FRIENDS.

09:16.687 --> 09:18.590
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
THEY WANTED TO DO
I WAS UP FOR.

09:18.690 --> 09:21.778
HMM. SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE
I KNOW.

09:22.071 --> 09:25.519
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY

09:25.619 --> 09:27.270
IS THAT HIGH SCHOOL
IS A TIME OF
SEARCHING

09:27.370 --> 09:29.357
AND FIGURING OUT
WHO YOU ARE
FOR EVERYBODY.

09:29.457 --> 09:31.860
YEAH, BUT I WAS CRUEL,

09:31.960 --> 09:35.216
ESPECIALLY
TO MY MOM AND MY DAD.

09:35.966 --> 09:40.123
THE DAY THEY DIED, I TOLD THEM
THEY WEREN'T MY REAL PARENTS,

09:40.223 --> 09:44.128
WHICH IS STUPID, BECAUSE
IT WASN'T EVEN HOW I FELT.

09:44.228 --> 09:47.299
I MEAN, JUST
BECAUSE I'M ADOPTED

09:47.399 --> 09:48.634
DIDN'T MEAN THEY
WEREN'T MY REAL PARENTS,

09:48.734 --> 09:50.636
BECAUSE...THEY WERE.

09:50.736 --> 09:54.393
HONEY, YOU WERE
JUST FEELING LOST,

09:54.493 --> 09:55.643
AND YOU
MADE A MISTAKE.

09:55.743 --> 09:57.147
I MADE
SO MANY MISTAKES,

09:57.247 --> 09:59.441
YOU KNOW?
BUT I GOT THROUGH THEM,

09:59.541 --> 10:01.361
AND I CHANGED,

10:01.461 --> 10:03.029
AND SO HAVE YOU.

10:03.130 --> 10:04.757
NOT IN TIME.

10:06.009 --> 10:07.803
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:08.762 --> 10:09.914
IT WAS, UM...

10:10.014 --> 10:12.252
FAMILY NIGHT,

10:12.352 --> 10:13.670
WHICH IS SOMETHING
WE DID EVERY WEEK,

10:13.770 --> 10:16.383
AND MY DAD...

10:16.483 --> 10:19.803
LEFT THE FIRE STATION EARLY

10:19.904 --> 10:22.641
TO PICK UP MY MOM AND I.

10:22.742 --> 10:24.684
YOUR DAD
WAS A FIREMAN?

10:24.785 --> 10:26.771
YEAH,

10:26.872 --> 10:28.833
AND I STARTED BITCHING,

10:29.293 --> 10:32.696
HOW I WAS TOO OLD FOR THIS

10:32.796 --> 10:35.535
AND IT WAS SUPER-LAME,

10:35.635 --> 10:38.805
AND HE JUST LOST IT.

10:39.015 --> 10:42.687
HE WAS SO ANGRY WITH ME.

10:44.147 --> 10:45.149
HE WAS SO ANGRY WITH ME

10:47.818 --> 10:50.722
THAT HE DIDN'T--

10:50.822 --> 10:53.243
HE DIDN'T SEE THE CAR
THAT SWERVED

10:54.828 --> 10:58.025
INTO OUR LANE,

10:58.125 --> 11:00.111
AND...

11:00.211 --> 11:02.823
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

11:02.923 --> 11:04.451
I'M ON THE PAVEMENT.

11:04.552 --> 11:07.514
THE CAR'S ON FIRE.

11:14.733 --> 11:17.929
I STILL DON'T KNOW

11:18.029 --> 11:19.448
WHY I SURVIVED
AND THEY DIDN'T.

11:20.617 --> 11:24.413
BUT YOU CAN'T
BLAME YOURSELF FOR THAT.

11:24.871 --> 11:26.874
WELL,

11:28.043 --> 11:30.381
I FEEL GUILTY
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

11:32.882 --> 11:34.553
I KNOW IT'S--
IT'S HARD,

11:36.514 --> 11:38.642
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA TRY
AND MOVE FORWARD.

11:41.145 --> 11:43.399
HOW CAN I
MOVE FORWARD, PIPER?

11:44.899 --> 11:46.737
I KILLED MY PARENTS.

11:51.953 --> 11:55.316
WHAT DO WE DO?

11:55.416 --> 11:56.651
HOW DO WE HELP HER
DEAL WITH SOMETHING

11:56.751 --> 11:58.237
THAT HAPPENED
IN THE PAST?

11:58.337 --> 12:01.216
SEND HER BACK TO IT.

12:05.930 --> 12:09.503
OK, WAIT.
SO I DON'T GET IT.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.339
YOU WANT TO SUMMON
THE GHOST OF THE PAST?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.760
FROM WHERE?
THE FICTION SHELF?

12:13.860 --> 12:15.844
DICKENS DIDN'T
MAKE THAT STUFF UP.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.931
HE WAS VISITED
BY A MALEVOLENT SPIRIT.

12:18.031 --> 12:20.101
DOESN'T MALEVOLENT
MEAN "BAD"?

12:20.201 --> 12:23.272
CLYDE'S NOT
THE FRIENDLIEST
GHOST THAT I KNOW,

12:23.373 --> 12:25.610
BUT HE IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO HELPS THE LIVING
VISIT THEIR PAST.

12:25.710 --> 12:28.530
CLYDE.
THE MALEVOLENT
SPIRIT'S NAME

12:28.630 --> 12:30.617
IS CLYDE?

12:30.717 --> 12:31.827
YEAH. HE DOESN'T
LIKE IT, EITHER.

12:31.927 --> 12:33.329
WAIT, WE'RE USING
BAD MAGIC TO TIME TRAVEL?

12:33.429 --> 12:35.707
SHOULD I BE WORRIED
ABOUT ANY OF THOSE
PERSONAL GAIN ISSUES?

12:35.807 --> 12:38.920
NOT AT ALL.
YOU'RE ONLY GOING BACK

12:39.020 --> 12:40.714
TO LEARN WHY
YOUR PARENTS DIED.
THAT'S ALL.

12:40.815 --> 12:43.844
EVERYONE READY?

12:43.944 --> 12:45.596
DON'T WE NEED
A SUMMONING SPELL?

12:45.697 --> 12:47.516
NO. CLYDE
ONLY IGNORES 'EM.

12:47.616 --> 12:49.185
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET CLYDE DOWN HERE.

12:49.285 --> 12:52.231
CLYDE!

12:52.331 --> 12:53.775

12:53.875 --> 12:55.569
FROM THE BOG
OF ETERNAL STENCH!

12:55.669 --> 12:57.781
YOU GOTTA MAKE HIM MAD.

12:57.881 --> 12:59.634
YOUR MOTHER
WAS A CHUNKY SUBSTANCE
FROM A GIN'S CESSPOOL,

13:00.384 --> 13:04.013
AND SHE SMELLED BAD, TOO.

13:14.821 --> 13:17.933
LEO!

13:18.033 --> 13:19.478
I WAS WITH A CLIENT!

13:19.578 --> 13:22.023
1969.

13:22.123 --> 13:23.901
WOODSTOCK.

13:24.001 --> 13:24.943
HENDRIX WAS ON STAGE!

13:25.043 --> 13:27.364
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

13:27.464 --> 13:28.658
I NEED YOU
TO TAKE PAIGE HERE

13:28.758 --> 13:30.870
BACK TO THE DAY OF
HER GREATEST PAIN.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.329
A JOB?

13:32.430 --> 13:33.791
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
SAY SO IN THE FIRST PLACE?

13:33.891 --> 13:35.751
NOT A JOB.

13:35.851 --> 13:37.504
A FAVOR.

13:37.604 --> 13:39.089
I DON'T DO CHARITY WORK.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.967
YOU OWE ME, CLYDE.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.555
OR DO I NEED
TO REMIND YOU OF YOUR
CLIENT THAT I HEALED,

13:43.655 --> 13:45.474
THE ONE YOU RETURNED
FROM THE PAST ON
THE EDGE OF A CLIFF?

13:45.574 --> 13:49.188
I BELIEVE THERE
WERE 32 BROKEN BONES.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.816
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I REMEMBER.

13:51.916 --> 13:54.085
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

13:55.086 --> 13:56.989
I ONLY OPEN THE DOOR
TO THE PAST.

13:57.089 --> 13:59.035
I DON'T GUARANTEE
NO SAFE TRIP!

13:59.135 --> 14:01.330
OBVIOUSLY.

14:01.430 --> 14:03.124
YEAH.
I NEED TO DO THIS.

14:03.224 --> 14:06.002
FINE.

TO HEAR YOUR CALL.

14:13.447 --> 14:14.975

WILL BE ON YOUR OWN.

WE'LL BE OK.
JUST TAKE CARE
OF PAIGE.

JUST DON'T LOOK DOWN.

14:33.141 --> 14:36.589
HOW'S ABOUT YOU TWO?

14:36.689 --> 14:38.508

TO THE PAST?

14:38.608 --> 14:40.762
SEE IT ALL A SECOND TIME.

14:40.862 --> 14:42.907
MY RATES ARE STEEP,
BUT FAIR.

14:43.699 --> 14:46.159
CAN YOU TAKE US BACK
TO MEET JOHN LENNON?

14:47.537 --> 14:49.063
Piper: NO.

14:49.164 --> 14:50.065
NO. NO. RIGHT.
WE'LL PASS.

14:50.165 --> 14:52.378
SUIT YOURSELF.

14:55.382 --> 14:59.078
IF YOU EVER
NEED MY SERVICES,

14:59.178 --> 15:01.041
JUST YELL.

15:01.141 --> 15:02.685
[SIGHS] WE NEED TO BE HERE
WHEN PAIGE GETS BACK.

15:07.149 --> 15:08.677
I'LL COOK DINNER,

15:08.777 --> 15:10.012
AND THEN WE CAN
JUST HANG OUT
FOR A WHILE.

15:10.113 --> 15:11.739
I HOPE
THIS PLAN WORKS.

15:19.458 --> 15:22.697
SO DO I.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.465
DON'T WORRY,
FRANKIE.

OH, MY GOD!

15:48.500 --> 15:50.151

15:50.251 --> 15:51.195
I'M SUPPOSED
TO COME BACK
AS A GHOST,

WANTED TO COME BACK

AND MAKE

ABOUT MY LACK
OF STYLE.

A LOOK AROUND, PAIGE.
