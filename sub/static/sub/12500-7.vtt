is low, even for you.

10:20.275 --> 10:22.676
You want to see low, Ethel?
Wait till I'm Governor.

10:22.677 --> 10:25.112
You'll be lucky to go outside
without a goddamn burqa!

10:25.113 --> 10:27.280
There's no way I'm
letting you run unopposed.

10:27.281 --> 10:29.583
Well, who's going to challenge me?

10:29.584 --> 10:32.853
I would like to announce
my candidacy for Governor!

10:32.854 --> 10:37.654
Why won't you people
leave our family alone?

10:39.327 --> 10:41.492
<i>[Singing]♪ I'm the
Governor, look at me!</i>

10:41.493 --> 10:43.531
<i>♪Everybody loves me, I'm the Governor!</i>

10:43.532 --> 10:45.700
<i>♪I'm the Governor, I'm the Governor!</i>

10:45.701 --> 10:47.482
<i>♪I'm the Governor!</i>

10:47.483 --> 10:49.841
<i>♪I'm the Governor!</i>

10:49.842 --> 10:51.939
Can you please shut up?

10:51.940 --> 10:54.455
I'm trying to pick out a 90-inch
TV for the Governor's mansion.

10:54.456 --> 10:56.300
Whoa, Malloy.

10:56.301 --> 10:59.555
Do you really think you're going to
live in the Governor's mansion with me?

10:59.556 --> 11:01.081
- Do you?
- What do you mean?

11:01.082 --> 11:04.741
I'm sorry, little buddy, but
governors don't live with bears.

11:04.742 --> 11:07.155
You backstabbing turncoat. I made you.

11:07.156 --> 11:10.991
Malloy, we'll just have to keep our
relationship on the down low, that's all.

11:10.992 --> 11:13.089
Everybody already thinks it's weird.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.764
Weird? Lincoln sucked off a kangaroo.

11:15.765 --> 11:18.765
Read a history book.

11:18.834 --> 11:22.628
And so, if you want a state
where all races live in peace

11:22.629 --> 11:26.055
and harmony without war,
rich people, or red meat,

11:26.056 --> 11:27.982
and the only violent
acts committed are against

11:27.983 --> 11:30.578
unborn babies, you should vote for me.

11:30.579 --> 11:31.779
That's great, Ethel.

11:31.780 --> 11:34.448
Connie, come on. You're
supposed to pretend to be Woody.

11:34.449 --> 11:36.250
Oh, sorry, that's right.

11:36.251 --> 11:38.519
[Imitates woody] Argh! I'm Woody!

11:38.520 --> 11:41.723
Connie, you stupid [Bleep]!
Go get rid of that militia!

11:41.724 --> 11:43.591
[Normal voice] No,
Woody. They're my friends.

11:43.592 --> 11:46.261
[Imitates woody] Shut the hell
up, Connie! Everybody hates you!

11:46.262 --> 11:48.362
[Crying]

11:48.531 --> 11:50.866
All that running and crying,
you'd think she'd be thinner.

11:50.867 --> 11:52.967
Ethel! How are you?

11:52.968 --> 11:54.736
- What do you want?
- Just thinking.

11:54.737 --> 11:57.305
I could see us actually
becoming pretty good friends.

11:57.306 --> 12:00.775
You know, when you're Governor and we're
both living at the Governor's mansion.

12:00.776 --> 12:03.044
You want to move into the
Governor's mansion with me?

12:03.045 --> 12:06.000
Think of all the late
nights we'd spend in our PJs,

12:06.001 --> 12:09.342
binging on Haagen-dazs, rubbing
our beavs to Ryan Gosling.

12:09.343 --> 12:14.956
You do realize that there's absolutely
no way I'd ever live with you, ever.

12:14.957 --> 12:17.792
You've been trying to ruin
my life ever since I got here.

12:17.793 --> 12:20.628
Girl, you so crazy. It was all in fun.

12:20.629 --> 12:22.096
The answer is hell no.

12:22.097 --> 12:26.657
The streets will run
red with your blood.

12:27.336 --> 12:32.807
So, when they said Pluto was no longer a
planet, well, that really ticked me off!

12:32.808 --> 12:34.008
Am I crazy?

12:34.009 --> 12:36.344
[Whimpers] Not from where I'm sitting.

12:36.345 --> 12:40.005
You know who else
likes Pluto? My sister.

12:40.006 --> 12:41.916
[Imitates female voice]
Guess what, big brother.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.615
[Normal voice] What, little sister?

12:43.616 --> 12:46.117
[Imitates female voice] Pluto's
not even a planet anymore.

12:46.118 --> 12:49.059
[Normal voice] Shut your
lying mouth, you bitch!

12:49.060 --> 12:51.386
Sorry. Sibling rivalry.

12:51.387 --> 12:54.127
[Laughs awkwardly] Oh!

12:54.128 --> 12:57.248
She... she seems nice.

12:58.199 --> 13:00.133
[Sighs]

13:00.134 --> 13:02.366
God damn it!

13:02.367 --> 13:04.407
[Music]

13:05.766 --> 13:09.501
Wow, you guys. What a great
militia meeting, right?

13:09.502 --> 13:11.312
Look at all these new members.

13:11.313 --> 13:14.215
Yeah, yeah. Shut your face and
pass the militia mac and cheese.

13:14.216 --> 13:15.044
[Gobbles food]

13:15.045 --> 13:16.804
Who the hell invited this guy?

13:16.805 --> 13:20.641
We are definitely anti... anti... uh...

13:20.642 --> 13:22.910
What the hell are you, anyway?

13:22.911 --> 13:25.245
I have no idea!

13:25.246 --> 13:26.713
This is awesome, Bobby.

13:26.714 --> 13:29.149
Our membership is at an all-time high.

13:29.150 --> 13:32.612
And isn't having a multicultural
militia so much nicer?

13:32.613 --> 13:36.190
Yeah, I guess so, but don't militias
need to make some sort of statement?

13:36.191 --> 13:38.092
Yes, you do.

13:38.093 --> 13:41.080
First of all, militias
don't have picnics.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.060
Well, what do militias do?

13:43.061 --> 13:46.028
Violent acts. How do you not know this?

13:46.029 --> 13:48.464
You guys look more like
the Ellis Island Book Club.

13:48.465 --> 13:49.965
Malloy, what are you doing?

13:49.966 --> 13:51.952
Quiet, militia Etheridge.

13:51.953 --> 13:53.968
Let the talking bear finish talking.

13:53.969 --> 13:58.051
If you want to be a real militia, you
need to stand up and do something big,

13:58.052 --> 14:01.711
something destructive, something
that puts you in the history books.

14:01.712 --> 14:05.614
Like that guy who invented
the double-donged dildo!

14:05.615 --> 14:07.310
Can he not talk?

14:07.311 --> 14:10.185
It's time to make a
statement the world will hear!

14:10.186 --> 14:12.188
[Cheering]

14:12.189 --> 14:14.624
- Hell yeah! Count us in!
- Yes!

14:14.625 --> 14:20.265
It's time we started acting
like a real [Bleep] militia!

14:21.265 --> 14:24.701
Our children's test scores have
been dropping at an alarming rate.

14:24.702 --> 14:26.335
What is your plan, Mr. Johnson?

14:26.336 --> 14:28.705
Listen, chuckles. I'll be
asking the questions around here.

14:28.706 --> 14:30.920
Uh, no, you won't. He's the moderator.

14:30.921 --> 14:33.502
Not anymore. I'm the moderator now.

14:33.503 --> 14:35.712

14:46.884 --> 14:49.327
Let's just take some
questions from the audience.

14:49.328 --> 14:50.328
I'll allow it.

14:50.329 --> 14:51.762
Hello, everybody.

14:51.763 --> 14:55.469
I'm the leader of the Ellis
Island Book Club militia.

14:55.470 --> 14:58.545
And we have decided to
assassinate the new Governor,

14:58.546 --> 15:01.497
so whichever one of
y'all wins, you're dead!

15:01.498 --> 15:02.818
Y'all have a nice day.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.576
Listen here. I don't respond to threats.

15:05.577 --> 15:09.679
All my life, I've been told that
because I'm a woman, I should give up.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.892
- Well guess what! I'm...
- [All gasp]

15:12.893 --> 15:14.946
Dropping out of the race
for Governor immediately.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.739
No, no, no, no. I'm
dropping out of the race.

15:16.740 --> 15:18.218
No, you're not! I dropped out first.

15:18.219 --> 15:20.591
I'm much more qualified to
drop out of this race than you!

15:20.592 --> 15:22.960
You can't tell me that I
can't drop out of this race.

15:22.961 --> 15:26.349
Would someone please
call me an ambulance?

15:26.350 --> 15:31.390
Jesus! This guy asks a
lot of [Bleep] questions!

15:35.165 --> 15:37.701
- Uh, Malloy?
- Yes, Connie?

15:37.702 --> 15:40.820
I'm really happy you joined our
militia and everything, but, uh,

15:40.821 --> 15:46.128
I'm not so sure about your idea to
violently assassinate the Governor.

15:46.129 --> 15:49.499
Relax, Connie. No one's gonna get hurt.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.283
- Really?
- Really.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.754
I just want to scare them
into dropping out of the race.

15:53.755 --> 15:56.139
If I can't live in the Governor's
mansion, neither can they.

15:56.140 --> 15:58.134
Trust me. No one's gonna die today.

15:58.135 --> 16:00.440
Someone's definitely going to die today,

16:00.441 --> 16:02.998
as Woody Johnson and
Ethel Anderson's names will

16:02.999 --> 16:05.639
remain on the ballot
whether they drop out or not.

16:05.640 --> 16:09.905
Which means one of them will be elected
Governor and swiftly assassinated.

16:09.906 --> 16:12.108
Ain't I a stinker?

16:12.109 --> 16:16.314
Hi, I'm Ethel Anderson, and there's no
way that I should be elected Governor.

16:16.315 --> 16:17.633
Why, you say?

16:17.634 --> 16:20.421
Because I'm a raging,
unrepentant alcoholic,

16:20.422 --> 16:23.851
and I believe the holocaust
never happened, but I wish it did.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.203
Vote Woody Johnson for Governor.

16:26.204 --> 16:30.187
Hi, I'm Woody Johnson, and there's
no use beating around the bush.

16:30.188 --> 16:32.626
I molest kids, and I love it.

16:32.627 --> 16:35.729
And I promise to make this state
a safe haven for terrorists.

16:35.730 --> 16:40.350
Hey, can I just say,
"[Bleep] Our troops"?

16:41.334 --> 16:44.890
Look where I can stick
the Statue of Liberty!

16:44.891 --> 16:47.691
Domestic violence isn't a problem...

16:59.487 --> 17:01.523
And the election results are in.

17:01.524 --> 17:03.758
If I win, I am dropping off the grid.

17:03.759 --> 17:06.590
I'll change my name to
something inconspicuous like...

17:06.592 --> 17:09.506
- Rick Swordfire.
- Yeah, good thinking.

17:09.507 --> 17:12.733
The winner, and new state Governor is...

17:12.734 --> 17:14.078
Woody Johnson.

17:14.079 --> 17:17.272
- What?
- Woo hoo! In your face, dead man!

17:17.273 --> 17:20.843
By the remarkably low
count of two votes to none.

17:20.844 --> 17:23.022
Wait. You voted for yourself?

17:23.023 --> 17:26.682
Well I wasn't gonna
vote for a goddamn woman.

[Australian accent] You've got the
wrong guy, my name is Rick Swordfire.

17:31.430 --> 17:37.051
I knew Rick Swordfire, and
you, Sir, are no Rick Swordfire!

17:37.052 --> 17:40.194
[Normal voice] Oh... et tu, Malloy?

17:40.195 --> 17:42.497
Hey, you wouldn't let me live
in the Governor's mansion.

17:42.498 --> 17:45.066
Okay! You can live in the
Governor's mansion! [Crying]

17:45.067 --> 17:48.589

I don't care! Just talk them down!

17:51.393 --> 17:53.422
Really? Okay, guys, great news.

17:53.423 --> 17:56.651
Put down your guns. The
assassination is a no go.

17:56.652 --> 17:57.712
Oh, hell no!

bothered and leave 'em hanging like that.

sense into these idiots.

could you possibly want to

18:18.496 --> 18:21.268
send by killing this
pathetic piece of shit?

We're gonna kill him
because he represents a

government controlled by
the zionist Jew threat!

Uh, Bobby, we're okay
with Jew people now.

Chaim got us these uniforms
from his garment factory.

18:32.133 --> 18:35.073
Fine, what I meant to say
was, we gonna kill him because

18:35.074 --> 18:37.717
he wants to flood our
shores with dirty immigrants.

18:55.165 --> 18:57.378

all about being anti-violence?

You've proved to me that women
are capable of great things.

19:19.517 --> 19:22.265

I did act like a misogynist
asshole, yet you still saved me. Why?

Because even though we
may be different genders,

deep down inside, we're
both red-blooded...

19:35.998 --> 19:41.449
- No, actually, I was going to say...
- Shh-shh. We'll leave it at that.

19:41.450 --> 19:44.889
I am pleased to announce that
my first act as your Governor

19:44.890 --> 19:47.888
is to remove the highway running
through Brickleberry Park.

19:47.889 --> 19:49.995
The wrecking crew is already on its way.

19:49.996 --> 19:53.699
Ah, well, Phil, your
family is great company,

19:53.700 --> 19:57.027
but we've been playing
for six straight days.

19:57.028 --> 19:59.487
Oh, we're just getting started.

19:59.488 --> 20:02.102
- Uh-oh. You forgot to say, "Uno"!

Aah!

20:08.973 --> 20:10.479
Uno!

20:10.480 --> 20:13.346
And with that done, I'm
stepping down as Governor.

20:13.347 --> 20:16.992
As a thank you to my friend Ethel, my
last act is to pardon Governor Melcher

20:16.993 --> 20:20.553

black guy and hand the job back to her.

me rob the cradle for nothing?

behind that sex tape?
