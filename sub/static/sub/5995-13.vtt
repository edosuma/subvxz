00:01.669 --> 00:03.671
Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.703 --> 00:04.672
Uh...

00:04.705 --> 00:06.440
That has Josh's name on it.

00:06.474 --> 00:07.575
That makes sense.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.509
He was barely here.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.444
My girlfriend is 20 feet
through that wall,

00:10.478 --> 00:12.113
and I'm standing here.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.214
I got to go.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.649
Audra Levine just got married.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.452
Also, she got the promotion
you didn't take.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.587
I was dead to him.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.621
He didn't want to spend

00:20.654 --> 00:21.722
any more time with me,

00:21.755 --> 00:23.357
and oh, we were
getting so close.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.592
I'm going to fix this.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.494
All we need is
some random guy.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.362
Ooh, Trent.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.730
Oh, that's a perfect name
for a fake boyfriend.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.699
I'm a bothsexual.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.434
The term is, uh, bisex...

00:34.535 --> 00:35.769
The water is being diverted

00:35.803 --> 00:37.771
away from the San Gabriel Valley

00:37.805 --> 00:39.440
and towards Los Angeles.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.674
Paula, this case
can't be over,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.810
because Josh and I
are having the best time.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.245
Okay, so I found something out.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.646
So did I.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.684
Trent? Baby?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.820
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:52.853 --> 00:54.588
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:54.622 --> 00:56.357
* One day I was crying a lot

00:56.390 --> 00:57.758
* And so I decided to move

00:57.791 --> 00:59.627
* To West Covina, California

00:59.660 --> 01:00.561
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

01:00.594 --> 01:02.830
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

01:02.863 --> 01:05.333
* But that's not why I'm here

01:05.366 --> 01:07.668
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.337
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:09.370 --> 01:10.571
That's a sexist term.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.572
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:11.605 --> 01:13.207
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

01:13.241 --> 01:15.843
* She's so broken inside *

01:15.876 --> 01:17.345
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.879
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:18.912 --> 01:20.714
Okay! We get it!

01:20.748 --> 01:22.716
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:29.523 --> 01:31.392
(grunting)

01:31.425 --> 01:33.194
Oh, honey.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.828
So what are you,

01:34.862 --> 01:36.897
uh, doing here,
because, uh,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.367
you said that you were
going to meet me at home?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.235
Yeah, I was,
but then your friend called,

01:41.269 --> 01:42.670
and so here I am.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.805
He's not your boyfriend.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.740
(scoffs)
He can't be.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.808
That picture

01:47.841 --> 01:48.909
that you said you took of him

01:48.942 --> 01:50.878
a few weeks ago in Palm Springs,

01:50.911 --> 01:53.747
that was taken five years ago.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.884
Yes, it was.
It was. Fair.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.752
Um, and that has
a very good explanation.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.221
And that is...

02:00.254 --> 02:01.322
No, it's, um...

02:01.355 --> 02:03.724
(sighs)
Okay.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.793
It's because I clearly
labeled it wrong.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.595
It's dumb.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.263
Look, honey,
I don't know what

02:09.297 --> 02:10.830
this girl's problem is,
but you and I

02:10.864 --> 02:11.899
have dinner
plans later.
Yeah.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.601
So I will see you
at home.
Okay.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.902
Okay?
Oh.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.204
TRENT:
All right.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.771
Bye.
Bye.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.773
I love you.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.575
I love you, too.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.576
(bells jingling, door closes)

02:22.610 --> 02:23.611
Oh.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.647
Uh, um, he was nice.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.950
Yeah, he loves kissing

02:29.983 --> 02:31.352
with tongue.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.487
Josh, oh, my gosh, okay,

02:33.521 --> 02:34.788
so this case we've
been working on,

02:34.822 --> 02:37.791
dude, it's like so much bigger

02:37.825 --> 02:39.293
than what I
initially thought.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.229
It's about, like,
 all of the landlords,

02:41.262 --> 02:43.231
and they're in cahoots with
a multi-billion dollar company,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.733
and they're
exploiting everybody.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.836
Like, this could be the biggest
case the county's ever seen.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.305
Wow, really?
Yes,

02:51.339 --> 02:52.340
so I need your help.
I need you

02:52.373 --> 02:54.675
to meet me at Whitefeather
in an hour, and together

02:54.708 --> 02:56.310
we're going to blow
this case wide open.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.578
Sure.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.579
Great!

02:58.612 --> 03:01.215
Okay, uh, the rest of you,
I will see you later.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.650
I'm going to go

03:02.683 --> 03:04.352
kiss my boyfriend some more.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.220
(pants rustling)

03:06.254 --> 03:07.955
Sorry about the loudness
of the pants.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.590
I don't know why people
fish in these.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.925
You'd think the sound
would scare away the fish.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.961
(bells jingling, door closes)

03:16.964 --> 03:18.299
No.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.733
No. No, no.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.968
This is not right.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.570
He is not her boyfriend.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.571
I can, I can feel it.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.674
God, I'm an idiot.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.742
What am I, what am,
what am I even doing here?

03:28.776 --> 03:30.478
I got

03:30.511 --> 03:32.613
caught up
in Bunchsanity again.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.947
I'm a moron.

03:33.981 --> 03:34.848
I have, I have to go.

03:34.882 --> 03:35.716
I'm late picking Heather up.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.485
I'm going to just forget
that I was here.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.486
But...

03:38.519 --> 03:40.454
My advice to the two of you

03:40.488 --> 03:42.923
is to stop obsessing
about Rebecca.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.526
Nothing good can come of it.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.528
(bells jingling)

03:47.561 --> 03:49.497
I guess I was wrong.
I'm, I'm sorry, I...

03:49.530 --> 03:50.698
Okay, babe.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.666
Babe, just take a deep breath.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.001
(exhales)
This, this has gotten

03:54.034 --> 03:55.403
way out of hand.
Well...

03:55.436 --> 03:57.004
I know you don't like her,
I get it,

03:57.037 --> 03:59.640
but this case could
be something great.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.376
Not just for us,
but for a lot of people.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.012
Just trust me, okay?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.917
Okay.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.685
I trust you.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.057
Nose?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.926
Nose.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.029
(laugh softly)

04:29.036 --> 04:29.737
Hey.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.072
I'm, uh, heading
back to work.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.343
I got a big case breaking,
so I just wanted to say,

04:35.376 --> 04:37.745
uh, thank you
for that kiss.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.912
Wow.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.081
(laughs)

04:41.114 --> 04:42.583
So, uh, anyway,
I'll see you later.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.584
Yeah.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.620
Unless you want to kiss again,
for any reason.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.755
Okay.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.289
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.466
That worked.
(laughs)
Okay.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.000
So anyway, I was
thinking, uh,

05:00.033 --> 05:01.902
maybe later,
we would, uh,

05:01.935 --> 05:04.071
go out for a
little bev-er-age.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.006
What's the, uh, what's that
accent? What are we doing?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.008
I don't know.
(both laugh)

05:08.041 --> 05:09.477
I don't know,
I'm sorry.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.544
But what do you think?

05:10.578 --> 05:11.979
Do you want to maybe
go get a drink later?
Yeah.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.481
Sure. Why not?
All right.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.482
We can just go to Home Base.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.484
Or, um,
Jimmy's House of Spirits

05:16.517 --> 05:17.651
has a great Chardonnay.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.819
Well, the thing is,
I was thinking

05:18.852 --> 05:21.355
that maybe I would
take you to

05:21.389 --> 05:23.824
(French accent):
La City of Los Angeles.

05:23.857 --> 05:24.825
Hmm.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.826
Accent happened again.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.861
I'm... I don't know
what's going on.
(laughs)

05:27.895 --> 05:28.962
(laughs)
It keeps coming up.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.098
So ju-just to be clear,
you, you want to get a drink,

05:31.131 --> 05:34.402
but just not any place where
people we know might see us.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.436
Exactly.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.104
Okay, look, Darryl,
I am cool with

05:37.137 --> 05:39.540
whatever you need to do
in your own life,

05:39.573 --> 05:41.742
it's all good, but I'm not going
to go back into the closet.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.010
Not for anybody.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.078
I didn't come out
until I was 12.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.514
Those were some
tough years.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.515
Oh, no, no, no. I didn't
mean it like that.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.582
No, no, it's okay.

05:48.616 --> 05:49.750
I got to go, 'cause I...

05:49.783 --> 05:50.851
I have a client,
I just remembered,

05:50.884 --> 05:53.387
so I will, uh,
talk to you later.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.891
REBECCA:
Guys, guys, guys, listen up.

05:57.925 --> 06:01.562
All of the local landlords are
being bribed to divert water

06:01.595 --> 06:04.398
from the San Gabriel Valley
to Los Angeles.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.766
I mean, God, it's insane.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.401
It's like the movie Chinatown.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.938
It, it's like Chin...
you guys, g...

06:10.971 --> 06:12.473
Guys, you've seen
 Chinatown, right?

06:12.506 --> 06:13.474
I've never even
heard of it.
No.
JOSH: No.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.975
What?!
Sorry.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.478
Critics say it's like one of the
top ten movies of all time.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.946
Well, now I got to see it.
All right.
I guess.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.113
Okay, when this
case is over,

06:20.147 --> 06:22.049
we're going to have
a movie night.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.017
Okay, I don't,
I don't know
Yeah, okay.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.086
about "China Time" or whatever
you're talking about,

06:26.119 --> 06:28.188
but I do know about
injustice, okay?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.190
And these guys are being
bribed to divert water

06:30.223 --> 06:33.026
from the San Gabriel Valley
into Los Angeles.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.127
So what we're going to do

06:34.161 --> 06:37.465
is we're going to get Joshes
from all over the Valley.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.500
All over.
Yes, we are going
to get plaintiffs

06:39.533 --> 06:41.869
from everywhere
and we're going to make this

06:41.902 --> 06:45.005
the largest class action lawsuit
L.A. County has ever seen.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.139
Awesome.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.475
Okay, so we need
to start calling people,

06:47.508 --> 06:48.576
like right now.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.678
Get as many people involved
in this thing as we can.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.046
Okay, you heard her, everyone,
let's get on the horn.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.882
Well, I-I-I'm in.
How can I help?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.517
Uh, you have friends
and family all over the Valley.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.651
Right, I do.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.654
Monrovia, El Monte,
City of Industry,

07:00.688 --> 07:02.122
Diamond Bar, Alhambra.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.123
Right, right,
all the places,

07:03.156 --> 07:04.892
so yeah, uh,
go, call them.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.959
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.495
You're the best.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.963
(exhales)

07:09.997 --> 07:11.198
(door closes)

07:15.102 --> 07:17.070
(screams, yells)

07:17.104 --> 07:19.106
You should lock your back patio.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.641
I'm worried about your security.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.477
Oh, my God, are...
are you going to kill me?

07:23.511 --> 07:25.078
No, why would I kill you?

07:25.112 --> 07:26.647
I love you.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.648
What?

07:27.681 --> 07:29.082
Rebecca Bunch,
I have loved you

07:29.116 --> 07:30.217
since the moment that I saw you

07:30.250 --> 07:32.152
freshman year in the cafeteria.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.254
You were eating
a mac and cheese sandwich.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.589
Remember?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.724
And then, last week,
out of nowhere,

07:36.757 --> 07:39.660
you friended me on Facebook
and then some lady called me

07:39.693 --> 07:41.261
and said that she thought
I was your boyfriend.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.096
I mean, what are the odds?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.832
So weird, right?

07:44.865 --> 07:48.001
Weird is a word for it.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.036
Yeah.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.104
Trent, so first of all,

07:51.138 --> 07:53.941
I can not thank you enough
for covering for me back there.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.976
I mean, you were
such a smooth liar

07:56.009 --> 07:58.679
and a very, um,
passionate kisser.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.681
Oh, thank you so much.
Yeah.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.082
And you seem like
an interesting guy.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.150
Oh, I am interesting.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.285
I own my own
computer programming firm,

08:05.318 --> 08:06.687
and I almost invented Twitter,

08:06.720 --> 08:08.822
but I thought, eh,
no one's going to use that.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.290
Huh.
And I have a pet lizard,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.926
and I drag boulders
and trees for fitness.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.127
Those facts are so fun.
Oh, cool.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.596
Like the definition
of fun facts.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.165
(laughing):
But, um, dude,

08:18.198 --> 08:20.133
this isn't happening.
Right.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.835
You're not, we're not going
to have a relationship.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.836
Oh.

08:22.870 --> 08:23.837
This is really weird.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.272
I know that the whole situation

08:25.305 --> 08:26.940
I got you into
was weird, but like

08:26.974 --> 08:28.876
this can't
happen right now.
It's weird, yeah.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.210
Yeah, okay,
so you see it?
This is weird.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.912
A hundred percent.
So you got to go.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.313
Yeah.
Oh.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.313
I don't want to have
to go back to your friends

08:34.347 --> 08:35.783
and tell them
I don't know you.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.818
I would much rather stay here
and make you dinner.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.520
How about that?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.756
Are you blackmailing me?

08:43.791 --> 08:44.925
Oh, you know what they say,

08:44.958 --> 08:47.194
one person's blackmailing
is another person's love story.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.195
Who says that?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.197
Me. I do.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.232
Got it from a phrase book.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.333
Okay.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.334
Let's just have
a quiet night at home

08:54.367 --> 08:55.769
and reconnect, huh?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.171
Do you like couscous? I do.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.608
Do you like Tarantino?
I don't.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.944
He spent the night
at your apartment?

09:03.977 --> 09:05.345
Thank you,
thank you so much.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.314
Yes, and before you
say anything,

09:07.347 --> 09:09.216
dude makes a great dinner.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.318
And then, he-he drew me a bath
and massaged my feet.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.221
It wasn't weird,
I wore a bathing suit.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.323
Okay, maybe you should
call the police.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.257
The pol...
and tell them what?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.859
I made up a fake boyfriend

09:18.892 --> 09:20.060
and now that fake boyfriend

09:20.093 --> 09:22.696
wants to be my
real boyfriend? No.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.364
I'm not going to do that.
Look, this guy's fine.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.934
I knew a million guys like
him in college, trust me.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.902
He's into all this now
and then he'll see me

09:28.936 --> 09:30.871
eat a piece of ham off the
ground and he'll move on.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.641
(elevator bell dings)
Ooh, there's Josh.
Just shut up about this.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.076
Um, I think Rebecca and Paula...
Oh, hey.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.010
Hi.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.311
Yeah, they're, they're...

09:42.182 --> 09:43.350
Yep.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.152
This is so exciting.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.920
I've always wanted
to work here.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.355
This place is so weird.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.057
A sports bar,

09:50.090 --> 09:51.191
but with kids
running around,

09:51.224 --> 09:52.292
where the moms
look like hookers

09:52.325 --> 09:53.761
and the hookers
look like moms.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.262
I love it.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.230
Are you sure it's a good idea
to recommend me, though?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.333
I've quit like almost
every place in town.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.369
You just haven't had the
right coworker, yet.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.272
Are you sure you want
your GF around 24/7?

10:05.305 --> 10:07.641
What? Yes, of course.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.942
Why wouldn't I?

10:10.077 --> 10:12.312
You have my undivided
attention here,

10:12.345 --> 10:15.182
and in my heart and soul.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.984
What?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.287
Thank you very much.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.388
I've got Irwindale.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.290
I got Citrus.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.992
I got La Puente.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.227
And I got donuts.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.228
(excited chattering)
Yeah, I was hungry.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.298
Uh, Rebecca, there's
some people here to see you.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.299
George, what did I say
about interrupting us

10:32.332 --> 10:33.400
while we're doing work?

10:33.433 --> 10:36.269
Right, but they said they're
from Greater City Water,

10:36.303 --> 10:37.938
and it's urgent.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.072
Oh.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.308
They must have heard

10:41.341 --> 10:42.943
about all the calls we're making

10:42.976 --> 10:45.245
and the motions we're filing,

10:45.278 --> 10:49.683
and that water company's
confidence has evaporated.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.219
Evaporated.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.221
(sighs)
Anyway, it's good news.
It's great.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.088
Oh.
Oh!
Oh.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.056
I thought you meant literally.
Cool.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.792
Wow, and we didn't even
have to go to court.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.227
You're so cool.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.862
I'm cool?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.196
Thank you.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.698
Rebecca,

11:04.732 --> 11:06.399
before you say "no",
like you did to the

11:06.433 --> 11:07.400
landlord,
Yeah?

11:07.434 --> 11:09.302
you know, that settlement offer
from last week,

11:09.336 --> 11:12.405
let's hear their offer first,
okay?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.474
Darryl, trust me,
they're scared.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.176
They're only here
to fork over the cashola.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.244
I've seen this a thousand times.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.345
I hope so.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.346
Come on, guys,
let's go

11:19.379 --> 11:21.448
fleece these losers.
Ha-ha.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.383
Yeah, sure. I love
a good fleecing.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.384
Oh, my God.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.786
What?

11:25.819 --> 11:27.387
They brought in my
old firm from New York.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.789
JOSH:
Are they good?

11:28.822 --> 11:29.890
Yeah, they're like

11:29.923 --> 11:34.427
Taylor Swift, Elon Musk
and Shonda Rhimes combined.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.833
(whispering):
Oh, no, they brought her.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.935
JOSH:
Who is that?

11:41.969 --> 11:43.270
She looks like
you used to.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.408
That is Audra Levine.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.077
(echoing)
 Audra... Audra Levine.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.344
Au-Au-Audra Levine.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.515
She has the life you
could've had, almost had,

11:55.548 --> 11:59.352
but ruined with all
your ridiculous choices.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.922
Oh, no.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.834
Levine.

12:13.867 --> 12:14.835
Bunch.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.036
You look well.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.771
You look like a farmer.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.372
Well, now I regret
saying you look well.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.941
It's been a long time.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.175
Audra, just give it up already.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.376
It's not important.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.945
Tell me what you
got on the test.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.313
It's none of
your business.
Give it to me.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.514
Stop.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.482
You got a 97?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.819
No one else got
higher than a 90.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.453
My mother says you cheat

12:33.486 --> 12:34.888
and that's how you get
better grades than me.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.556
No, I don't cheat.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.025
That's ridiculous.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.026
You're ridiculous.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.961
Why are you always bothering me?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.830
I mean, we're both losers
who have no friends,

12:42.863 --> 12:44.832
so shouldn't we,
you know,

12:44.865 --> 12:46.166
team up or something?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.868
Never.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.402
I want to be the best
and you're in my way.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.939
Sorry, not sorry.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.340
Loser.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.843
So,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.410
what are you

12:57.444 --> 13:00.347
and your team doing
slumming it out here?

13:00.380 --> 13:01.815
Well, Greater City Water
has deep pockets

13:01.849 --> 13:03.416
and wanted the best,

13:03.450 --> 13:06.286
which you used to be,
and now you're here.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.488
Slumming it is right.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.890
This firm is a dump.

13:09.923 --> 13:10.824
This town is a dump.

13:10.858 --> 13:11.859
It is not.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.193
Honestly,
it's not so great.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.129
Bunch, I'm here
to give you an out.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.498
We are here
with a settlement offer.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.000
Great, we'd love to hear it.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.201
Rebecca, don't say anything.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.138
Our offer is...

13:26.006 --> 13:27.540
...no settlement.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.876
What? Wait a minute.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.878
So when you said

13:30.911 --> 13:32.612
there was a settlement
offer, there is no of...

13:32.645 --> 13:34.147
Wh... That was
just a dirty trick?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.282
Oh, you're good.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.316
Well, frankly,

13:36.349 --> 13:37.550
you have no case, and no shot,

13:37.584 --> 13:40.020
and no idea how to blend your
foundation at your jawline,

13:40.053 --> 13:41.855
so you need to back off,

13:41.889 --> 13:43.556
withdraw the case,
and save yourself

13:43.590 --> 13:45.859
the embarrassment of everyone
knowing that you're a loser.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.228
Okay, let's tone it down.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.297
No.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.070
* This is real deep beef
from way back in the past *

13:57.104 --> 13:59.206
* Deeper than I'll put a foot up
in the crack of your ass *

13:59.239 --> 14:00.507
* Come on, let's do this

14:00.540 --> 14:02.375
* Your little pals
can witness how vicious *

14:02.409 --> 14:03.944
* This Westchester
alpha bitch is *

14:03.977 --> 14:05.478
* I'm straight up malicious

14:05.512 --> 14:07.014
* A verbal curb stomper

14:07.047 --> 14:08.648
* Since we were toddlers,
I've studied every *

14:08.681 --> 14:10.217
* Chink in your armor

14:10.250 --> 14:11.418
* And between your folks'
divorce, and that *

14:11.451 --> 14:13.320
* Haircut on you,
I'm really not sure *

14:13.353 --> 14:15.055
* Which one's
the bigger shondeh *

14:15.088 --> 14:16.323
* That means "disgrace"

14:16.356 --> 14:17.958
* I'm translating for the goys

14:17.991 --> 14:20.160
* Our life lines have been
parallel like corduroys *

14:20.193 --> 14:22.129
* But now, we'll see
whose bars will prevail *

14:22.162 --> 14:23.663
* In this beef
of two hard-as-nails *

14:23.696 --> 14:25.265
* Shebrews from Scarsdale

14:25.298 --> 14:26.967
* We've got
a conflict of interest *

14:27.000 --> 14:29.002
* I'm about to give Levine
the business *

14:29.036 --> 14:30.303
* Spittin' venomous hate

14:30.337 --> 14:32.005
* Penetrating her defenses

14:32.039 --> 14:33.006
* It's a JAP battle

14:33.040 --> 14:33.974
A what?

14:34.007 --> 14:36.009
* A Jewish American Princess

14:36.043 --> 14:37.077
* Rap battle

14:37.110 --> 14:38.478
* Daughters of privilege

14:38.511 --> 14:39.212
* Spittin' mad flow

14:39.246 --> 14:40.981
* Find that term offensive?

14:41.014 --> 14:43.150
* Too bad, yo, oh, snap

14:43.183 --> 14:44.985
* It's a JAP battle rap

14:45.018 --> 14:47.354
* Look, academically,
you could never catch me *

14:47.387 --> 14:50.090
* You were close,
but no match scholastically *

14:50.123 --> 14:50.991
* Nohow, no way

14:51.024 --> 14:55.128
* I put the "O.G."
in "5.0 G.P.A." *

14:55.162 --> 14:56.997
* Well, speaking of which,
are you A.P. graded? *

14:57.030 --> 14:59.499
* 'Cause these days you look
a bit heavily weighted *

14:59.532 --> 15:01.034
* And all your book crackin'

15:01.068 --> 15:02.970
* Don't make up for the fact
that I'm strapped *

15:03.003 --> 15:04.671
* With that killer instinct
that you lack *

15:04.704 --> 15:06.239
* Sweetheart, here's what

15:06.273 --> 15:08.241
* You're not understanding,
I'm street-smart *

15:08.275 --> 15:10.110
* You mean, 'cause you minored
in Urban Planning? *

15:10.143 --> 15:11.178
* Bitch, I know you

15:11.211 --> 15:12.445
* That tough act's a bluff

15:12.479 --> 15:15.115
* So sheket bevaka
shut the hell up *

15:15.148 --> 15:17.617
* Your temper, you lost it,
oh, cute *

15:17.650 --> 15:19.452
* Like you're going
to lose this lawsuit *

15:19.486 --> 15:22.222
* Keeping your piehole shut
would be quite wise *

15:22.255 --> 15:25.192
* Though you kept it open wide
for the AEPI guys *

15:25.225 --> 15:27.260
* And I banged your
hedge fund manager fiancé *

15:27.294 --> 15:29.296
* Back in college
over winter holidays *

15:29.329 --> 15:31.564
* Bathroom stall at the
matzo ball and honestly *

15:31.598 --> 15:32.632
* I gotta say

15:32.665 --> 15:34.067
* Really not hot at all

15:34.101 --> 15:35.202
* Finished quick, rotten lay

15:35.235 --> 15:37.037
* This is...
* A JAP battle

15:37.070 --> 15:38.438
* Bane of my existence

15:38.471 --> 15:39.406
* Your rhymes are facile

15:39.439 --> 15:41.108
* From Golden's Bridge

15:41.141 --> 15:42.109
* To North Castle

15:42.142 --> 15:43.110
* Wipe you off the map

15:43.143 --> 15:44.311
* In this JAP battle rap

15:44.344 --> 15:46.113
* Bunch, you're a curse,
you're a blight *

15:46.146 --> 15:47.380
* We were frenemies
at first spite *

15:47.414 --> 15:48.615
* Think your verse is tight?

15:48.648 --> 15:49.749
* Then you're tripping
like birthright *

15:49.782 --> 15:51.384
* I'll wipe the mirth
right off *

15:51.418 --> 15:53.586
* Your ugly mug
and fill you full of slugs *

15:53.620 --> 15:54.787
* Like a straight up thug

15:54.821 --> 15:57.390
* Uh, that word is racist,
someone ought to tell you *

15:57.424 --> 16:00.060
* Like me,
I belong to the ACLU *

16:00.093 --> 16:02.495
* Spare me,
I'm a card-carrying member *

16:02.529 --> 16:05.098
* Plus, I spent a semester
in Kenya, remember?

16:05.132 --> 16:05.999
* Well, I volunteered in Ghana

16:06.033 --> 16:07.367
* Well, I guess that
makes us equal *

16:07.400 --> 16:08.268
* Well, it's settled then

16:08.301 --> 16:10.137
* We're both cool
with black people *

16:10.170 --> 16:10.837
* 'Cause we're liberals

16:10.870 --> 16:12.605
* Duh, progressive as hell

16:12.639 --> 16:15.042
* Though, of course,
I support Israel *

16:15.075 --> 16:17.144
* Audra, wait
we share so many traits *

16:17.177 --> 16:18.211
* Should we shake hands

16:18.245 --> 16:20.047
* And erase the hate

16:20.080 --> 16:21.481
* Created by
our mothers pitting *

16:21.514 --> 16:22.649
* Us against each other for

16:22.682 --> 16:24.051
* Accolades and grades

16:24.084 --> 16:25.385
* We were egged on
like Seder plates *

16:25.418 --> 16:27.020
Nah.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.321
* In summation

16:28.355 --> 16:29.422
* You left New York

16:29.456 --> 16:31.091
* For this sunburnt shtetl

16:31.124 --> 16:33.093
* Now you're like
"Oh, Audra, let's settle" *

16:33.126 --> 16:35.362
* You want to get salty
like the Dead Sea? *

16:35.395 --> 16:37.030
* Word,
but call off this suit *

16:37.064 --> 16:38.231
* Or you're dead, see, word.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.070
Hmm.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.307
Don't smirk at me, Connors.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.443
(elevator bell dings)

16:50.477 --> 16:53.213
She's a very
angry young lady.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.548
And so scary.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.718
Are you sure
you can beat her?

16:58.751 --> 17:00.753
Of course I can.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.755
Now let's get back
to compiling evidence

17:02.789 --> 17:04.523
and building
the strongest case we can.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.525
There you go.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.559
Great.
All right.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.161
Go team.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.465
I scared.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.702
KEVIN: Greg.
GREG: Hey.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.204
Is this the girl, Heather,
you were telling me about?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.003
This is her.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.506
Greg says you want
to work here.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.309
Wow, you are really beautiful,

17:22.342 --> 17:23.510
and you seem super cool.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.711
Uh, thanks.

17:24.743 --> 17:25.744
Kevin can be

17:25.778 --> 17:27.714
aggressively nice,
you're not going to like it.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.249
So tell me why
you want to work here.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.185
Well, Greg and I thought
it'd be fun to hang out

17:32.219 --> 17:32.985
and spend time together

17:33.019 --> 17:34.354
and maybe hook up
in the stockroom

17:34.387 --> 17:35.522
in our spare time.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.390
(laughs)
We... we didn't say that.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.525
Yeah, we did.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.759
I like her honesty.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.161
It's terrific.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.130
And you can bang it out
in the stockroom

17:43.163 --> 17:44.164
whenever you want.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.398
Okay, that's not
hot any more.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.566
You're hired.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.235
Here's your apron, my lady.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.203
You got a great
girl here, Serrano.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.538
Shall we hug?
Nah...

17:51.571 --> 17:53.173
I got two arms,
no waiting.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.175
No, I don't really
like strangers...
No waiting.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.276
...touching me.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.477
(door closes)

18:02.482 --> 18:03.816
Oh, you.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.818
What, you forgot I was here?

18:05.852 --> 18:07.387
Yeah, kind of, I had a long day.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.556
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.158
(sighs heavily)

18:11.191 --> 18:13.460
Dude, can you please leave?

18:13.493 --> 18:16.196
But I made homemade
tagliatelle.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.097
From scratch?
Mm-hmm.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.333
Okay.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.834
Leave after dinner.
Okay.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.736
And after you
do the dishes.
Sure.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.904
And after you
clean the counter.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.174
I don't want like
raw eggs everywhere.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.275
I'll do that.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.276
Okay.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.145
Oh, no, this is so weird,
I don't know you.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.181
Does anyone really
know anyone?

18:34.214 --> 18:37.284
Yeah, lots of people
know lots of people.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.286
I think you should check
your facts on that.

18:39.319 --> 18:43.290
Look, I know that I'm
blackmailing you a little,

18:43.323 --> 18:44.591
and I've been told that
that's not an appropriate

18:44.624 --> 18:45.792
way to meet people.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.360
Vino?

18:47.394 --> 18:49.196
Fine, fine.
Okay.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.830
But I also really like you.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.233
And you look like
you've had a hard day,

18:53.266 --> 18:54.667
and you just need someone
to take care of you.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.369
So come on.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.638
Tell me about your day.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.373
No.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.942
Okay.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.446
Oh, so there's this bitch
I grew up with named Audra.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.381
Oh, that's so good.

19:08.415 --> 19:11.418
God, it you'd seen the look
in Audra's eyes, Trent,

19:11.451 --> 19:12.919
I mean, she hates me.

19:12.952 --> 19:13.853
She really hates me.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.555
I mean, it's because
I'm smarter than her.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.257
She's so insecure, I mean,

19:17.290 --> 19:18.491
she went to Cornell,
which as you know,

19:18.525 --> 19:19.659
is like the community college

19:19.692 --> 19:21.794
of Ivy League schools.
(both laughing)

19:21.828 --> 19:23.230
Why even go to college?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.864
Like join the Navy.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.199
Mmm, this is so good.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.600
Thank you.
Anyway,

19:27.634 --> 19:29.436
she's always hated me,
she'll do anything to beat me,

19:29.469 --> 19:31.304
and now she has
all the resources

19:31.338 --> 19:32.239
of a powerful
law firm behind her.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.774
I feel so bad

19:34.807 --> 19:37.377
because I promised all these
people that I'd help them,

19:37.410 --> 19:40.880
and I-I didn't know they'd
bring in, like, the big guns.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.315
I also feel bad

19:42.349 --> 19:43.550
because I'm working with Josh,

19:43.583 --> 19:44.884
you know, the guy that

19:44.917 --> 19:45.985
you lied to.
Oh.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.221
Yeah, that Josh,
and I'm just,

19:48.255 --> 19:49.689
I'm terrified if I fail

19:49.722 --> 19:52.925
that he will lose
all respect for me.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.862
Hey, look, no matter what,
I believe in you,

19:55.895 --> 19:57.330
and that's what matters, right?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.765
No.

19:58.798 --> 20:03.336
Okay, uh, honey, you have Bert,
your water expert, right?

20:03.370 --> 20:05.972
And you have all his research,
which you verified.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.241
You have plaintiffs
from all over the Valley.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.776
You're case is rock solid.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.314
I just wish I had that one piece
of irrefutable evidence.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.484
You'll find it.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.019
Thanks for listening.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.087
Yeah.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.823
Okay, you can sleep at the foot
of my bed tonight.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.625
Really?
Yeah.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.693
Like a dog?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.828
Yes, Trent, like a dog.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.331
Okay.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.934
Ugh, please don't
look that excited.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.669
It's just how I look.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.938
PAULA:
 You let him sleep
 on your floor?

20:38.971 --> 20:40.807
Uh, it's fine,
he didn't touch me.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.874
And also,
it wasn't weird.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.310
I wore my bathing suit.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.413
Please forget Trent.
Where are the plaintiffs?

20:46.446 --> 20:47.414
We confirmed 50 people.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.350
Traffic wasn't this bad
coming in from the east.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.018
You don't think
I should've specified

20:52.051 --> 20:54.354
that it's a legal court,
not a food court, do you?

20:54.387 --> 20:55.322
Maybe they got scared.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.289
Yeah, taking on

20:56.323 --> 20:58.391
a big corporation
in a big city is scary.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.026
Maybe they feel like they
don't deserve to be heard.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.394
You spend your whole
life bottling away

21:01.428 --> 21:02.862
what you need
to let out.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.632
Like a dormant volcano
just waiting to erupt.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.799
What is up with you lately?

21:06.833 --> 21:07.800
DARRYL:
I don't know.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.068
Oh, look, Josh.
Hi, Josh.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.737
Oh, there's Josh,
he's going to think

21:10.770 --> 21:12.405
I'm such a loser.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.773
Hey, Josh, hi.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.808
Hi.
Wow, where is everyone?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.516
Wow, where is everyone?

21:23.550 --> 21:24.784
I was just in the snack bar,
there's no on in there.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.086
But don't worry,
I got Skittles,

21:27.119 --> 21:29.756
so I wouldn't get
chocolate on my new suit.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.324
Isn't it great?

21:31.358 --> 21:33.493
It was expensive,
so I put it on my credit card,

21:33.526 --> 21:35.628
'cause I know
we're going to win.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.431
Yes, that is right,

21:38.465 --> 21:40.500
we are going to win this,
big man.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.335
Yeah.
Hey, guys.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.436
Oh, a person.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.505
Ugh, God, it's just
White Josh and his eight-pack.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.106
DARRYL:
What are you doing here?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.575
Uh, I came for
moral support.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.576
Oh, for Josh.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.577
No, dude.

21:50.610 --> 21:51.778
Came to support you.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.014
As friends, don't worry.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.617
I'm not going to grab your
junk in public or anything.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.818
Don't do that.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.952
J.K., dude.
J.K.?

21:59.986 --> 22:00.920
J.K. Rowling?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.522
J.K., just kidding.
Stands for just kidding.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.690
Oh, just kidding.
JOSH:
WiJo.

22:03.723 --> 22:04.791
Oh.
Oh, hey, buddy.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.593
Hey.

22:06.626 --> 22:07.627
This is a disaster.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.528
No one showed.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.730
Josh is going to lose
all respect for me.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.899
(exhales)
Okay.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.468
All right,
I'm just going to ovary-up,

22:15.502 --> 22:17.604
and I'm going tell Josh that

22:17.637 --> 22:19.706
this didn't work out, and...

22:19.739 --> 22:21.040
And Monrovia is here.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.711
El Monte is here.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.114
South El Monte is here.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.650
North El Monte is here.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.118
Josh...

22:32.151 --> 22:34.554
all the El Montes are here.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.688
Sorry we were late.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.557
There was traffic on the 10.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.793
Anyway, we are here to
stand up for our rights.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.930
We deserve hot water
and decent water pressure.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.932
And we deserve
clean dishes.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.936
* Can you hear
a trickling sound? *

22:49.969 --> 22:53.105
* That's the
leaky sink of change *

22:53.139 --> 22:55.942
* It's a drip, drip, drip

22:55.975 --> 22:59.612
* That no handyman can fix

22:59.646 --> 23:01.748
* For we shall not be ignored

23:01.781 --> 23:04.651
* Till our honor is restored

23:04.684 --> 23:07.754
* And your basement is flooded

23:07.787 --> 23:11.023
* With justice

23:11.057 --> 23:13.560
* Soon the raging waters

23:13.593 --> 23:15.962
* Will crash upon the shore

23:15.995 --> 23:19.098
* When we sing
of raging waters *

23:19.131 --> 23:21.701
* It's not just a metaphor

23:21.734 --> 23:23.536
* What we mean is

23:23.570 --> 23:24.971
* It's also

23:25.004 --> 23:27.440
* A water park in San Dimas

23:27.474 --> 23:29.676
* But that's an aside

23:29.709 --> 23:32.645
* It's not what
we're marching for *

23:32.679 --> 23:35.648
* Can you hear
a trickling sound? *

23:35.682 --> 23:38.518
* That's the
faulty faucets of truth *

23:38.551 --> 23:40.853
* It's a drip, drip, drip

23:40.887 --> 23:42.822
* That will make you go

23:42.855 --> 23:44.791
What is that?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.927
* We shall not be denied

23:47.960 --> 23:49.762
* Till we restore our pride

23:49.796 --> 23:51.731
* And then we'll all go

23:51.764 --> 23:56.002
* To Raging Waters

23:56.035 --> 23:58.871
And we'll ride Dr. Von Dark's
Tunnel Of Terror!

23:58.905 --> 24:00.640
Good idea, Baldwin Park.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.041
Yeah!

24:02.074 --> 24:03.543
* For we have had enough

24:03.576 --> 24:07.246
* Of Hollywood stealing
our water *

24:07.279 --> 24:09.949
* They're probably using it

24:09.982 --> 24:12.685
* To make party drugs
and Oscars *

24:12.719 --> 24:15.922
* Our precious water
shouldn't be *

24:15.955 --> 24:17.790
* Funneled to celebrities

24:17.824 --> 24:23.830
* No more water for BJ Novak's
ecstasy factory *

24:26.065 --> 24:27.166
What?

24:27.199 --> 24:29.201
* Can you hear
a trickling sound? *

24:29.235 --> 24:32.805
* That's the janky shower
of glory *

24:32.839 --> 24:34.841
* A drip, drip, drip

24:34.874 --> 24:36.976
* That will keep you up

24:37.009 --> 24:38.678
* All night, and then

24:38.711 --> 24:41.648
* You'll be late for work

24:41.681 --> 24:44.651
* And you won't be able
to focus *

24:44.684 --> 24:49.288
* And you'll come home
to a basement *

24:49.321 --> 24:51.691
* That's been flooded

24:51.724 --> 24:55.494
* Flooded with justice...!

25:03.870 --> 25:04.971
You ready?

25:10.342 --> 25:13.680
Well, back to the
ol' ecstasy factory.

25:13.713 --> 25:14.847
Excuse me.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.755
(TV changing channels)

25:22.789 --> 25:23.923
What are you looking for?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.157
Uh, oh, wait,

25:25.191 --> 25:26.893
I found it.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.661
It's that water trial
that Rebecca's doing.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.162
It's on local cable access.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.297
I think it already started.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.599
REBECCA:
Your Honor,

25:32.632 --> 25:35.134
we are all here today,

25:35.167 --> 25:38.270
to try and redress
an egregious injustice.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.305
KEVIN:
Here you go.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.207
Hey, look at that!

25:41.240 --> 25:42.642
It's Rebecca on the TV.

25:42.675 --> 25:43.676
She's one of our regulars.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.678
The one that orders those

25:45.712 --> 25:47.346
custom cheeseburger pizzas.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.281
Look, everyone, look!

25:49.315 --> 25:52.585
It is classic case of the
common man being exploited

25:52.619 --> 25:54.654
by corporate interests.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.122
And I will prove today...

25:56.155 --> 25:59.859
Man, she looks hot in her
little legal outfit, right?

25:59.892 --> 26:01.227
I'd pound that gavel.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.696
Guys, nobody wants
to watch this silly trial.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.764
What are you...

26:04.797 --> 26:05.865
Hey!
(all grumbling)

26:05.898 --> 26:07.767
Yes, they do.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.636
JUDGE:
You may call your first witness.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.204
Okay, it looks like we've missed
opening arguments,

26:12.238 --> 26:15.808
but Rebecca's about
to present her witnesses.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.777
I call to the stand,
Joshua Chan.

26:17.810 --> 26:18.745
KEVIN:
That's Josh!

26:18.778 --> 26:20.847
(laughs)
Hey, he's also one
of our regulars.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.914
He drinks his beer

26:21.948 --> 26:23.215
right out of the bottle.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.651
I love that guy.
Shh!

26:24.684 --> 26:27.286
I'm just trying to
hear the testimony.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.656
(pounding loudly)

26:29.689 --> 26:31.157
Now, Josh, can you confirm
HEATHER:
What is your problem?

26:31.190 --> 26:32.625
that you were
the first person

26:32.659 --> 26:35.094
to alert the council
of this problem?

26:35.127 --> 26:37.830
Uh, yes, I can confirm
that I was the one

26:37.864 --> 26:40.366
who alerted Ms. Bunch
to the water situation.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.804
We noticed the hot water
going out about a month ago.

26:44.837 --> 26:47.740
And I told my wife, "I hate you,
what did you do to the water"?

26:47.774 --> 26:49.809
Then I realized
it wasn't her fault.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.411
We just thought,
"Hey, we're from Alhambra.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.848
Maybe we just don't deserve a
fancy Los Angeles hot shower."

26:55.882 --> 26:58.250
Let me be the first person
to tell you, you do.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.719
She's doing great.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.287
Greg, you see how great
our girl is doing?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.689
Not my girl.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.090
Not interested.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.860
Next, I would like
to call to the stand

27:07.894 --> 27:10.697
a former employee
of Greater City Water,

27:10.730 --> 27:12.899
and a water technology expert...

27:12.932 --> 27:14.166
That's me.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.735
Excuse me.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.708
Bert, thank you so much
for being here today.

27:21.741 --> 27:22.709
My pleasure.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.811
Oh, and thank you for
buying me this new suit.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.046
It feels so good
against my bare skin.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.881
I don't believe
in underwear.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.185
So those documents
you have in your hand,

27:33.219 --> 27:34.987
tell me, what are those, Bert?

27:35.021 --> 27:37.356
That is research that
I've been compiling for years.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.091
First, when I worked
at Greater City Water,

27:39.125 --> 27:42.094
and then when I worked
on a very extensive

27:42.128 --> 27:43.830
independent research project

27:43.863 --> 27:45.965
nobody asked for
or wanted to read.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.767
That is, until you, Ms. Bunch.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.437
Your Honor,
I present exhibits A through X.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.774
Careful with that.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.978
JUDGE:
Your witness, Ms. Levine.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.179
Oh, my God, look,

28:00.212 --> 28:02.314
the scary opposing lawyer's
coming over now.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.316
(bar patrons booing)
Boo!

28:04.350 --> 28:06.986
Scary lawyer lady, boo.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.420
You suck.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.956
I do not like
the look of her.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.225
It looks like she orders
everything on the side.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.060
Hello, Bert.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.361
Hello, Ms. Lawyer.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.896
What is your degree in?

28:16.929 --> 28:18.130
Advanced hydro-engineering.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.166
I have two Ph.D.s,
as a matter of fact.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.234
Wow, impressive.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.871
Those are excellent credentials.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.238
Thank you.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.907
And how long did you work
at Greater City Water?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.141
15 years.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.744
Great, and how long have you
been a diagnosed schizophrenic?

28:32.779 --> 28:33.980
16 years.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.281
(gallery exclaiming)

28:38.985 --> 28:41.854
No further questions,
Your Honor.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.055
Wait, what?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.223
Oh, no.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.391
Oh, man.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.860
Thought you weren't interested.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.862
I'm not.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.530
(gavel banging on TV)

28:51.563 --> 28:53.032
REBECCA:
Your Honor, uh,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.366
may we take a brief recess?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.903
Yes, a-a recess
so that I can go home.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.105
The court will sit in recess.
(bangs gavel)

29:01.007 --> 29:02.408
He has a diagnosed of what...?

29:02.441 --> 29:04.877
(low, overlapping chatter)

29:04.911 --> 29:06.078
(sighs heavily)

29:06.112 --> 29:07.446
What am I going to do?

29:07.479 --> 29:08.848
She just knocked out Bert.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.149
I mean, we can't lose him,

29:10.182 --> 29:11.183
he's most of our case.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.353
No, Trent, uh-uh,
uh-uh, not now.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.988
PAULA:
Tucked in turtleneck.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.256
That's not a look
you see every day.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.958
Hey, I'm sorry
to interrupt, babe,

29:18.991 --> 29:20.059
but I have something for you.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.928
That's really sweet,
but I'm not hungry right now.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.062
No, I didn't cook today.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.564
Instead, I hacked into the
Greater City Water server,

29:25.597 --> 29:27.834
and I got you these.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.374
These are e-mails.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.044
These are e-mails that...
(laughs softly)

29:38.077 --> 29:40.112
that clearly expose a cover-up.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.280
Yeah.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.882
Oh...

29:42.915 --> 29:44.116
Oh, my God.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.117
This is great.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.353
This is great,
we can win the case with these.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.821
Can I sleep in the bed now?

29:48.855 --> 29:49.388
No.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.256
Uh, just let me answer.

29:57.229 --> 30:00.032
I mean, these are amazing.

30:00.066 --> 30:03.035
We, we could win the case
in a second.

30:03.069 --> 30:05.171
Trent, Trent, Trent.

30:05.204 --> 30:08.474
Oh, thank you so much, um,
but now, please leave.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.309
Okay. Good luck.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.944
Yeah, okay.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.380
He looks like a Kennedy,

30:14.413 --> 30:16.048
but a sober one.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.216
Yeah, I figured it out.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.951
It's like if two
Kennedy cousins mated.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.519
(gasps)
Totally.
Yeah.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.955
Okay, listen,
I want you to win this case

30:22.989 --> 30:24.423
more than anyone,

30:24.456 --> 30:27.193
but if anybody finds out
that this is stolen,

30:27.226 --> 30:29.395
you, you are in
big trouble.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.998
I mean, who's going
to tell them, Trent?

30:32.031 --> 30:34.066
He won't, especially if I let
him sleep in the bed tonight.

30:35.401 --> 30:36.535
Paula, we need this to win.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.104
All those people
are counting on us.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.105
Think about it,

30:39.138 --> 30:41.107
if Audra Levine had these,
would she use it?

30:41.140 --> 30:44.410
Yes, because she is a monster.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.480
JUDGE:
Be seated.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.551
Recess has ended.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.921
Ms. Bunch, do you have
any more evidence,

30:54.954 --> 30:56.522
or are you ready for
your closing statement?

31:01.293 --> 31:02.361
Yes, Your Honor.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.431
I, um...

31:14.073 --> 31:17.876
I... would...

31:19.478 --> 31:22.081
I...

31:23.115 --> 31:25.451
Something's wrong.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.219
What's going on?

31:28.387 --> 31:31.157
I, um...

31:33.225 --> 31:35.161
YOUNG AUDRA:
 Let's play slaps.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.562
Ha.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.265
When I grow up,

31:39.298 --> 31:41.300
I'm going to be the
best at everything.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.301
Me, too.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.703
I'm going to get into
all the best colleges.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.039
I'm going to get
all the best jobs.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.440
(groans)
I'm going to live
in the best house,

31:48.474 --> 31:50.009
and the best
second house.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.111
Well, I'm going
to be the happiest.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.345
What? That's stupid.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.014
Who cares about
being happy?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.018
Your Honor, what's going on?

31:59.051 --> 32:00.286
Is she having a stroke?

32:00.319 --> 32:01.353
Why is she staring at me?

32:01.387 --> 32:02.488
Ms. Bunch?

32:02.521 --> 32:04.390
Yes.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.092
Sorry.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.097
Your Honor,

32:11.130 --> 32:14.233
this case really comes down
to a few simple facts,

32:14.266 --> 32:16.302
and one of the
most important facts

32:16.335 --> 32:17.703
is that people who live

32:17.736 --> 32:20.406
not 45 minutes from here,

32:20.439 --> 32:23.209
two hours in rush hour,
are being

32:23.242 --> 32:27.613
relentlessly exploited
by a big fancy, greedy,

32:27.646 --> 32:29.348
Los Angeles corporation.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.184
Now, our documents prove that,

32:32.218 --> 32:34.353
and I hope you don't
rule out Bert's evidence

32:34.386 --> 32:39.358
just because, you know,
he's got a few issues.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.260
Don't we all?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.229
Yeah.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.531
You know...

32:47.233 --> 32:48.267
...six months ago,

32:48.300 --> 32:50.269
I would have tried
this case very differently...

32:51.670 --> 32:54.540
...but now, I'm a resident
of the San Gabriel Valley,

32:54.573 --> 32:58.310
and all I can do

32:58.344 --> 33:01.380
is hold myself
to the same standard

33:01.413 --> 33:04.083
of integrity and honesty
of the people I represent.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.286
Your Honor,

33:07.319 --> 33:10.456
this is a community of decent,
hardworking people,

33:10.489 --> 33:12.691
and they deserve a voice
just as much as anyone else.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.297
So no matter what happens today,
win or lose,

33:18.330 --> 33:19.465
I'm going to continue
to fight for them

33:19.498 --> 33:20.566
until they receive justice.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.772
That's all I got.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.775
(mouthing)

33:30.809 --> 33:32.544
Did you see that?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.246
She's crazy.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.116
Who goes into a courtroom
and says all of that?

33:37.149 --> 33:38.617
She's... she's...

33:38.650 --> 33:42.454
Oh, my God, I know
what's happening.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.190
What?
Look,

33:44.223 --> 33:46.258
I've seen a lot
of Hallmark movies

33:46.292 --> 33:48.294
and the look on
people's faces

33:48.327 --> 33:51.197
before they run and
confess their feelings,

33:51.230 --> 33:53.199
that's your face.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.267
No, no, no.

33:55.301 --> 33:56.435
I used to like her, but...

33:56.468 --> 33:59.171
But you still do,

33:59.205 --> 34:01.773
and I don't want to be
your backup plan.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.409
What are you saying?

34:03.442 --> 34:04.476
I'm saying...

34:04.510 --> 34:07.713
* Don't settle for me

34:07.746 --> 34:09.447
What?
* Come on, dude

34:09.481 --> 34:11.417
* Don't settle for me

34:11.449 --> 34:13.252
* Trust me

34:13.284 --> 34:14.686
* I know guys

34:14.719 --> 34:16.688
* And that look in your eyes

34:16.722 --> 34:19.291
* Means you're in love

34:19.324 --> 34:20.525
Love?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.328
Who are you all of a sudden?

34:22.360 --> 34:25.331
Shut up and listen
to my wise reprise.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.300
* We've had some fun together

34:28.333 --> 34:30.536
* Hold on a second, Heather

34:30.569 --> 34:34.440
* But I need, like,
so much more *

34:35.407 --> 34:37.842
* I'm way too badass

34:37.876 --> 34:40.379
* To be someone you settle for

34:42.313 --> 34:44.449
Go see her, okay?

34:48.454 --> 34:49.455
(sighs)

34:54.860 --> 34:56.562
JUDGE:
 Be seated.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.797
(gavel bangs)
Recess has ended.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.699
We are back in session.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.168
Ms. Bunch.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.271
I would like to begin by saying,

35:05.304 --> 35:08.807
I truly admire your
dedication to your clients,

35:08.840 --> 35:11.877
and the amount of passion
that you have for this case.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.549
But I am afraid that
Ms. Levine and her colleagues

35:17.583 --> 35:20.186
have raised sufficient doubts
about your evidence,

35:20.219 --> 35:21.420
and therefore,

35:21.453 --> 35:23.255
I must find in favor
of the defendants,

35:23.289 --> 35:25.357
Greater City Water.
(gallery exclaiming)

35:25.391 --> 35:27.159
Thank you,
this court is adjourned.

35:27.193 --> 35:28.627
(gavel bangs)

35:29.895 --> 35:32.564
AUDRA:
Yes!

35:32.598 --> 35:35.167
(clears throat)
Excellent.
(laughs)

35:45.277 --> 35:46.512
Hi, everyone.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.448
Um,

35:49.481 --> 35:51.550
everyone, I, uh...

35:51.583 --> 35:54.320
I'm sorry.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.922
I'm really sorry.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.498
(rhythmic clapping)

36:12.971 --> 36:15.974
* We have heard
the trickling sound *

36:16.007 --> 36:18.244
* It's the faulty faucet
of truth *

36:18.277 --> 36:21.680
* It's a drip, drip, drip

36:21.713 --> 36:24.783
* That fills us all with pride

36:24.816 --> 36:26.985
* Slow clap, slow clap

36:27.018 --> 36:29.255
* Yes, we never saw the lies

36:29.288 --> 36:30.322
* Slow clap, slow clap

36:30.356 --> 36:32.958
* Until you opened our eyes

36:32.991 --> 36:34.460
* Now let's

36:34.493 --> 36:35.961
* All

36:35.994 --> 36:37.563
* Go to

36:37.596 --> 36:43.235
* Raging Waters...

36:51.877 --> 36:53.845
I don't understand.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.013
They're not mad at me?

36:55.046 --> 36:55.981
PAULA:
Mad at you?

36:56.014 --> 36:57.015
You stood up to the bully.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.585
You gave them a voice.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.986
(chuckles)

37:01.019 --> 37:03.422
I am so proud of you.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.359
Um, I'm just going to pack up.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.327
I'll meet you outside, okay?

37:10.562 --> 37:12.664
Well, it was a thrill
going up against you.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.467
Thank you, Audra.

37:15.501 --> 37:18.504
Especially, because now,
I think we can agree,

37:18.537 --> 37:20.672
that I've just won,
in general.

37:20.706 --> 37:23.975
Yes, yes, you have.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.044
But here's the thing.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.681
You beat someone who
doesn't exist any more.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.650
Yeah, I don't care.
A win's a win.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.819
Hey, Audra.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.854
Take care of yourself, okay?

37:36.888 --> 37:40.692
I know how hard
your life can be.

37:40.726 --> 37:43.629
Don't forget to be happy,

37:43.662 --> 37:46.298
'cause that's really important.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.033
I am happy.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.669
I'm so happy.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.371
This is what happy feels like.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.939
This is what
happy feels like.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.006
Why aren't you happy?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.375
Why aren't you happy? Okay.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.753
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.688
Wait, Josh.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.757
Look, I am so sorry.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.359
I'm sorry I asked you to hide.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.760
It was not right.

38:17.062 --> 38:20.031
(loudly):
I am bisexual!

38:20.065 --> 38:22.334
I'm going for drinks
with this gay man,

38:22.368 --> 38:23.635
whom I have a crush on.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.637
He's way out of your
league-- nice job.

38:25.671 --> 38:26.638
WHITE JOSH:
Hey, back off, dude.

38:26.672 --> 38:29.341
He looks like Tom Selleck.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.876
Sorry about that.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.811
Well, should we go
for that drink?

38:34.580 --> 38:36.114
Yes, we...
Right there.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.049
Under, yeah,
there you go.
Okay.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.451
(clears throat)
(laughs)

38:39.485 --> 38:41.420
Ms. Bunch?
I'm Paul Ramirez

38:41.453 --> 38:42.754
from the metro desk
at the paper.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.756
You might have lost,

38:44.790 --> 38:46.525
but I think you've uncovered
the biggest local story

38:46.558 --> 38:47.993
since the City of Bell scandal,

38:48.026 --> 38:49.127
and I promise you,

38:49.160 --> 38:50.429
we're going to get
to the bottom of it.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.763
We will not less this go.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.366
Great.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.435
Hey, um...

38:56.468 --> 38:58.737
This should help
get you started.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.140
You didn't get that from me.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.009
I mean, you, look,
you did get that from me,

39:04.042 --> 39:05.377
but if anyone asks you,

39:05.411 --> 39:06.745
"Did you get... "
No, I get it, I get it.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.480
Right, you get phrases, right.

39:08.514 --> 39:09.548
Okay.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.818
Hey.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.085
Hey.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.086
I, uh,

39:15.120 --> 39:16.855
brought you some chocolate.

39:17.889 --> 39:22.127
We can mess up
our clothes, now.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.530
Thanks.

39:25.764 --> 39:29.768
Hey, um, I'm sorry.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.903
Stop.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.840
You were brave.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.042
You were like Rocky.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.710
Or...

39:38.744 --> 39:41.112
Creed, at-at least.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.381
But, but which I loved.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.424
Rebecca.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.061
You're not perfect.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.097
No one is.

40:00.165 --> 40:03.635
You tried really hard today.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.444
I just wanted to
make everyone happy.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.748
And, I don't know,

40:16.782 --> 40:19.485
I wanted you to
be proud of me.

40:19.518 --> 40:23.589
You wanted me to be
proud of you?

40:28.093 --> 40:30.996
I didn't know you thought
about me that much.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.733
Of course I do.

40:39.638 --> 40:43.542
Well, do you think
about me, like, too?

40:59.525 --> 41:01.226
Oh, Greg, I'm sorry.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.996
You're a nice guy,
you really are,

41:05.030 --> 41:07.165
but, I mean,
those two in there,

41:07.198 --> 41:09.501
they were just
meant to be.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.537
I mean, you have
to see that now.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.838
Okay, I understand,
but are you sure I have to go?

41:46.872 --> 41:48.574
Yes, Trent.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.743
But I never got a chance
to read you something.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.244
I wrote you a letter.

41:53.278 --> 41:55.213
Okay, fine.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.615
Okay.

41:59.951 --> 42:01.887
* Dear Rebecca Nora Bunch...

42:01.920 --> 42:03.822
Nope, uh-uh.
