01:05.319 --> 01:07.754
Dear Lewis,
enclosed please find

01:07.880 --> 01:09.632
one bus ticket and
two silver dollars

01:09.720 --> 01:11.073
for your trip to Michigan.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.588
I'm really sorry about
the loss of your parents.

01:15.520 --> 01:19.195
Your mom was my sister,
so, that makes you family.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.035
And I'll do my best to make
you feel right at home.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.435
As Einstein said,
"Life is like a bicycle.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.560
"To stay balanced, you gotta
keep moving forward."

01:29.960 --> 01:31.029
And so will we.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.199
I look forward to meeting ya.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.999
Your uncle, Jonathan.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.433
PS, sorry for the stain on the
letter, that's chocolate.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.596
Mom, Dad, are you there?

01:46.600 --> 01:47.715
Am I gonna be okay?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.359
"Cannot say."

02:04.000 --> 02:05.960
Gonna buy Charlie
a bike for his birthday.

02:06.040 --> 02:10.318
- He's gonna love it!
- Emma Jean! Bus is here!

02:14.640 --> 02:16.631
Last stop, New Zebedee.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.600
Are you coming?

02:25.360 --> 02:26.395
Oh, golly.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.155
I'm a little nervous.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.096
- You want me to get that for you?
- If you don't mind.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.456
No problem, ma'am.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.656
- Thank you so much.
- There you go.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.749
Have a great night.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.000
Oh, come on. Don't kill yourself
before I've had a chance to meet ya.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.068
Lewis, I'm your uncle, Jonathan.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.554
Are you wearing a robe?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.359
It's a kimono.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.440
Oh.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.240
Here, let me
help you with that.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.312
Oh! Good Lord, what do you got
in this thing? Encyclopedias?

03:06.480 --> 03:07.515
Dictionaries.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.039
Oh, you're serious.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.639
I like new words. I think
they're very pulchritudinous.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.517
Well, welcome
to New Zebedee.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.877
Or should I say "salutations"?
You can look that one up.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.672
I know what
"salutations" means.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.671
Well, smart kid.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.557
Uh, do you think that
we're gonna be home soon?

03:27.640 --> 03:29.440
Because the Captain
Midnight show's almost on.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.816
Uh... You don't have to worry
about that, I don't have a TV.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.037
But, I do have a big poker game tonight,
if you wanna join. Do you play?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.118
Uh, no, I'm 10.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.270
Duly noted.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.395
Huh. Here we are.
Excuse me.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.389
The Muggin Samoon.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.634
Temperamental
door handle. Hop in.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.710
Here you go.
Watch your tootsies.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.434
All right, here we are.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.154
You can get out here.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.309
Here we go.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.228
Home sweet home.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.390
Do you like Halloween?
Hmm?

04:45.480 --> 04:48.119
Oh, no. I keep those up
year round.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.997
Mr. Barnavelt!

04:50.080 --> 04:51.752
Come, darling.
Yes, good puppy.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.513
Mr. Barnavelt!

04:53.600 --> 04:56.956
Ah, Mrs. Hanchett.
Marmalade.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.560
Is that a robe?

04:58.680 --> 04:59.795
It's a kimono.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.477
You've been playing
your saxophone again.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.755
Madame, not everyone
can appreciate the intricacies

05:04.840 --> 05:06.273
of a free-form jazz odyssey.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.416
I don't care what you play.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.317
You're playing at 3:00
in the morning.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.352
So, I'm begging you!
Who's this?

05:11.800 --> 05:15.349
Oh, this is Lewis, my nephew.
He'll be living with me.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.030
You're responsible for
keeping a human child alive?

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
That's right.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.478
Good evening.
This way, Lewis.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.595
I'll try to keep it down
around 3:00 a.m.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.469
But, uh, them's my
best jamming hours.

05:34.520 --> 05:35.748
And, here we are.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.350
Wow, you've...

05:58.040 --> 05:59.234
That's a lot of clocks.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.312
Well, what constitutes a lot is
really a matter of personal taste.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.197
For me, it's a perfect
amount of clocks.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.150
Oh, sorry. There's a
deranged cuckoo in there.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.595
Your ratchet wheel's shot, and the
click spring's not far behind.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.116
Hello. You're Lewis, I presume?
How was your trip?

06:20.720 --> 06:23.598
This old hag is my next-door neighbor,
Mrs. Florence Zimmerman.

06:23.960 --> 06:28.715
I'm relieved to see you didn't inherit
your uncle's freakishly oversized head.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.598
Huh. Says the woman who
literally looks like a Q-tip.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.513
Oh, look.
The giant head is angry.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.798
My God, did that withered
purple skeleton just speak?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.549
It's nice to meet you.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.638
Lewis, are you hungry?
Yes, please.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.800
Florence, I'm gonna
show Lewis to his room.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.656
For once in your life,
could you make yourself useful

06:45.680 --> 06:48.256
and whip up a batch of those chocolate
chip cookies?

06:48.280 --> 06:49.759
And how would you
like them, sir?

06:49.840 --> 06:51.831
Stuffed down your throat,
one by one?

06:51.920 --> 06:53.911
Or crumbled up
and shoved into your pants?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.035
Ignore her, Lewis.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.271
She thinks she's smarter than me because
she's got more college degrees.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.868
No, I think I'm smarter than you
because I'm smarter than you.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.798
Shh!

07:03.880 --> 07:05.120
But, Uncle Jonathan?
Mmm.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.680
Don't I have to have dinner before
I'm allowed to have cookies?

07:08.120 --> 07:10.881
Well, why not just eat cookies for dinner?
They're far more delicious.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.355
I know. It's just,
we had these house rules.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.675
Well, not in this house.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.309
There's no bedtime,
bath time or meal time.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.155
You can eat cookies till you
throw up for all I care.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.350
You'll see. Things are
quite different here.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.600
All mine?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.234
All yours.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.952
Although, why this is yours
I have no idea.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.355
You know it's about the complete
opposite of real magic.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.555
Um...

08:00.640 --> 08:03.279
It's the last thing my parents
gave to me before the...

08:05.520 --> 08:06.669
The car crash.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.438
I'm sorry.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.710
Uh, here, yeah,
take that back.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.878
Um, I have a tissue
around here somewhere.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.320
Ah.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.036
Here you go.
No, hold on. Sorry.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.756
I didn't mean to, to...

08:28.400 --> 08:31.756
I didn't realize the ball was
of emotional significance.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.034
Almost there.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.748
Feel free to grab any color
tissue, they're all the same.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.876
Hey, gorilla groin, are we
playing poker, or am I playing solitaire?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.035
Hold your horses,
you scarecrow!

08:44.120 --> 08:46.190
Right?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.072
Calling that a poker face
is an insult to faces.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.718
Sore loser, frumpy.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.995
Well, beat that.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.550
He wins. Again.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.830
You're hustling me.
You've played before.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.954
I haven't. I swear.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.599
Beginner's luck, I guess?

09:25.080 --> 09:27.958
Well, I'm gonna drown my sorrows
in some hot cocoa. You want some?

09:28.040 --> 09:29.109
Yes, please.
Florence?

09:29.200 --> 09:30.394
Delighted.
Get your own.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.480
Choke and die.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.456
So, how long have you lived
next door to Uncle Jonathan?

09:35.480 --> 09:38.438
Oh, we've been friends forever.
Ever since I came here.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.476
Ran here, actually.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.795
From Paris.
After the war.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.436
And, no. To answer
that look you're giving me,

09:51.520 --> 09:53.954
your uncle and I aren't anything
kissy faced.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.514
Gross!
Ugh!

09:55.720 --> 09:56.755
The word's "platonic."

09:57.240 --> 09:58.355
That's right.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.313
Look, your uncle drives me nuts.
And he doesn't always smell so terrific,

10:04.400 --> 10:08.552
but he's gotten me out of more tough
scrapes than I care to mention.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.515
You know, I've found that all
one really needs in this world

10:13.600 --> 10:15.431
is one good friend.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.712
Oh, but I'm sure
you've got lots.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.636
Yeah. Tons.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.629
All my friends
are really great.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.069
Hmm.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.196
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.877
I really miss you guys.
Love you.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.358
Uh, Uncle Jonathan?

12:19.560 --> 12:20.816
You've
got to go into the wall.

12:20.840 --> 12:21.896
What do you mean I have to...

12:21.920 --> 12:22.976
Will you...
I am going in the wall!

12:23.000 --> 12:24.256
You did not go into the wall yesterday.
Yes, I did.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.336
I saw you.
You did not go... You...

12:25.360 --> 12:26.395
Hello?

12:26.480 --> 12:27.754
Lewis!
Didn't see you there.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.316
Big day. First day of school.
How'd you sleep?

12:30.400 --> 12:31.435
I...

12:31.560 --> 12:33.118
Fine. How did you sleep?

12:33.200 --> 12:35.395
Peachy. Like a baby.
Like a big peachy baby.

12:35.480 --> 12:36.959
Okay, off you go.
Knock 'em dead.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
I played it perfect,
he suspects nothing.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.393
Forty-third,
New Zebedee Blue Ribbon Bake-Off...

12:59.320 --> 13:01.436
Hold the door!

13:07.880 --> 13:09.393
Clark,
let's make a decision.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.110
Herman.

13:33.760 --> 13:34.760
Good hustle, Herman.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.349
Thanks, Coach.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.675
Woody.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.109
We're even teams now.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.115
Let's play ball.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.838
Maybe next time,
ankle-biter.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.360
Coach.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.776
Come on, just pick him.
No, just pick him.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.800
No.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.189
Come on.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.353
Fine. All right. You're with us.
You can play, right?

14:00.520 --> 14:01.520
Sure.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.628
I'm open! I'm...

14:06.080 --> 14:08.496
Goggles, get up! Come on, guys!
Down the court! Down the court!

14:08.520 --> 14:09.840
- You all right?
- Bring it on!

14:10.920 --> 14:11.955
You good?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.256
All right, open your space up.
Come on, guys, open the space!

14:14.280 --> 14:16.191
Now, again. Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

14:16.280 --> 14:17.640
Pass the ball!

14:17.800 --> 14:19.518
Goggles,
what's going on?

14:20.080 --> 14:22.056
Come on, let's go. Defense! Look alive.
Look alive, guys.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.559
Goggles, make the shot!
Come on!

14:23.640 --> 14:24.959
- Make the shot!
- Goggles!

14:25.440 --> 14:27.237
Not at me! The basket!

14:27.320 --> 14:28.376
You gotta pass
the ball, Goggles!

14:28.400 --> 14:29.879
Goggles, Goggles,
I'm open!

14:29.960 --> 14:31.029
I'm sorry!

14:31.120 --> 14:33.480
Come on, give it back to Owen!
Give it back to Lewis!

14:33.640 --> 14:35.835
Hey, guard your guys,
guard your guys! Let's go!

14:35.920 --> 14:37.956
- Shoot! Shoot!
- Shoot! Shoot!

14:41.760 --> 14:43.671
Nice shot, Speedy.
Thanks, Coach.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.256
Attention, students.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.750
The honor class club is meeting in
the library today, after school.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.348
There he is. Star forward
for the Minneapolis Lakers.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.351
How you doin', buddy?
I'm good.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.201
A vote for Tarby Corrigan is a vote
for pop in the drinking fountains.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.816
Thank you.
Hey! A vote for Tarby Corrigan

14:57.840 --> 14:59.560
is a vote for pop in
the drinking fountains!

14:59.680 --> 15:02.274
Please. How is he gonna carbonate
the drinking fountains?

15:14.960 --> 15:16.029
Whoa.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.480
Come on! Hit it!

15:18.520 --> 15:20.909
Don't just stand there.
Can you pitch?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.119
Uh, no, not very well.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.948
I'll take what I can get.
Come toss me one.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.829
Come on.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.314
What are you doing here?
Where are all your friends?

15:42.680 --> 15:43.954
Football practice.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.391
Can't play.
Can't do anything.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.158
My butt is just
warming the bench.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.157
So, you're new in town.
Where do you live?

15:55.760 --> 15:58.194
Kind of this big, old place
on the end of High Street.

15:59.760 --> 16:00.875
Wait.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.999
You live in
the slaughter house?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.518
I'm sorry. The what?

16:05.880 --> 16:08.110
Some old guy died there.
Now it's haunted.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.759
Well, everyone says so.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.320
Have you seen
anything creepy?

16:11.560 --> 16:12.993
No. Well...

16:14.000 --> 16:16.480
Last night I thought I heard
something, but it wasn't anything.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.511
It was just my uncle.
What was he doing?

16:18.600 --> 16:20.591
I don't know,
just sort of wandering around.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.633
I think he was
looking for something.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.593
Maybe he was looking
for an ax?

16:24.800 --> 16:25.869
It's his house.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.312
Why wouldn't he know
where his own ax is?

16:28.560 --> 16:31.028
Maybe he hid it from the
police after the last murder.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.510
Look, I'm just trying
to help us both out.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.160
You can't vote for me
if you don't have arms.

16:39.920 --> 16:40.920
Come on.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.675
Lewis.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.720
Lewis?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.108
Lewis.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.795
Sweetheart.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.872
Hey, kiddo.
I missed you so much.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.674
I miss you too, Mom. A lot.

17:16.560 --> 17:21.190
Your dad and I, we'd give
anything to be with you again.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.674
You know that, right?

17:23.800 --> 17:26.916
So?
How are you making out?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.558
How do you like
Uncle Jonathan?

17:30.280 --> 17:32.350
He seems nice. Just...

17:34.320 --> 17:35.355
What?

17:35.840 --> 17:38.752
Hey! It's okay.
You can tell me.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.995
This house is scary, and old, and scary.
And there's all these clocks.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.469
And I see weird stuff out
of the corner of my eye and...

17:47.320 --> 17:48.548
I feel like...

17:48.640 --> 17:51.313
I almost feel like that Uncle
Jonathan's hiding something.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.559
That's because he is.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.989
Hiding something.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.915
From you.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.393
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

18:02.120 --> 18:03.120
but you're in danger.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.238
Danger?

18:05.640 --> 18:07.119
What danger?
What do you mean?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.077
You're gonna
have to be brave.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.232
But I... Mom, this is me.
I'm not brave.

18:18.480 --> 18:22.473
First you get the book,
then you get the key.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.636
Book? Key? What are
you talking about?

18:31.720 --> 18:33.199
Do you hear the ticking?

19:06.040 --> 19:07.109
Brave.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.988
Brave. Brave.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.074
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.476
You can't hide forever.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.350
Help!

22:00.440 --> 22:03.079
Help! Let me out!
Help! Please!

22:03.160 --> 22:04.798
Help me! Let me out!

22:06.040 --> 22:07.758
It's me.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.956
Down boy! I said, down.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.076
Go. Go on. Go to
your room. Go on. Get.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.792
I'm sorry
you had to see that.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.314
No. No. No.
Houses don't attack you.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.176
And if they do attack, you're
definitely not supposed to say,

22:21.200 --> 22:22.280
"Sorry you had
to see that."

22:23.160 --> 22:25.390
Is this place haunted?
Are you gonna ax murder me?

22:25.480 --> 22:26.480
What? No.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.976
You're gonna ax murder me,
aren't you?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.440
I'm not gonna
ax murder you.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.714
Then what is going on?

22:31.320 --> 22:34.630
Well, one thing's for sure.
The house likes you.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.115
Houses don't like anything.
They're houses.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.677
Do you know what
a warlock is, Lewis?

23:20.760 --> 23:22.432
It's...

23:22.800 --> 23:23.800
A boy witch.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.069
Well...

23:27.000 --> 23:29.514
I think they're a little
more than boy witches.

23:30.080 --> 23:34.710
"Warlock. Noun.
A man who practices magic."

23:35.960 --> 23:36.960
A boy witch.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.672
Are you saying that...

23:42.760 --> 23:44.113
You're a warlock?

23:44.600 --> 23:45.749
Would it scare you
if I was?

23:49.800 --> 23:53.031
Well, are you a good
warlock or a bad one?

23:53.160 --> 23:55.754
Ah. Depends on what
you mean by "bad."

23:56.200 --> 23:59.033
I'm nice,
but not that good.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.359
Just a parlor
magician, really.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.078
But, uh,
Mrs. Zimmerman...

24:03.160 --> 24:06.755
Now, she's nice
and good. Damn good.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.517
Got a doctor of magic quorum degree
from the University of Göttingen.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.480
Why are you always
wandering around at night?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.633
What's that ticking
in the walls?

24:15.720 --> 24:16.755
You've heard that?

24:19.960 --> 24:22.315
This house used to be owned
by another warlock.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.119
Isaac Izard
and his wife, Selena.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.350
He, uh...

24:29.440 --> 24:30.555
Passed away.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.355
And left a magic clock
in the walls.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.635
Why?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.119
Because he's a terrible...

24:38.440 --> 24:39.714
Joker.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.189
Practical joker.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.831
Put a clock in the walls
to drive me nuts.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.456
I try to drown it out
with all those other clocks,

24:46.480 --> 24:47.520
but it doesn't
really work.

24:48.480 --> 24:53.759
So, at night I go around the house
and search for the damn thing.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.314
With an ax?

24:58.040 --> 25:00.315
Sometimes I get over-enthused.
I'll admit that.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.076
Do you have to be
born a boy wi...

25:08.280 --> 25:09.315
A warlock?

25:09.400 --> 25:13.029
No. Anyone can learn. They study.
Practice hard enough.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.674
Can I learn?
No.

25:14.760 --> 25:15.829
But you just said anyone.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.480
Grown-up anyone.
There's charts, and hieroglyphs,

25:18.560 --> 25:20.437
and stuff that would stump
a Harvard professor.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.200
And I don't have time to teach a...
Please?

25:22.320 --> 25:24.038
Please. Please teach me.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.953
Please. Please.
Please. Please. Please.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.110
Okay! Have it your way.

25:34.920 --> 25:35.989
Oh.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.998
Let me know when
you've read all those.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.633
Just for a start.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.431
Jack-o'-lanterns.
They scare away evil.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.597
And iron does too.
Well, it repels evil, like bug spray.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.336
And that is why
we have iron horseshoes.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.396
And that's why cemetery gates
are made of iron.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.357
Mmm-hmm,
mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.199
And how does one
become a full-fledged warlock?

26:19.440 --> 26:22.273
You have to defeat an evil
spirit by using your own magic.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.112
That is absolutely right.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.632
What smells
of rancid sulfur?

26:34.960 --> 26:36.075
Bad kitty!

26:38.880 --> 26:40.736
Am I gonna have to defeat
an evil spirit one day?

26:40.760 --> 26:44.435
Oh, don't worry. Not for a long, long time.
You're perfectly safe.

26:47.720 --> 26:48.720
That's safe?

26:52.560 --> 26:54.357
As long as it's fed.

26:54.440 --> 26:58.035
Used to be Florence's pet garter
snake, William Snakespeare.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.035
She tried to turn it purple,
the spell backfired.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.476
And, between you and me, most of
her spells backfire these days.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.600
Why?

27:05.680 --> 27:07.840
Ah, you'll have
to ask her that one yourself.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.639
What's all that?

27:10.360 --> 27:13.909
Charms, hexes,
wards, spells.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.392
Evil can't come within 20 feet of
that cabinet, much less open it.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.795
What's in it?

27:22.160 --> 27:23.912
You know how I said
there were no rules?

27:24.840 --> 27:26.717
Actually, there's one rule.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.349
Don't open that cabinet.
Ever.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.715
Or I'll toss you out on your
ear, you understand?

27:35.360 --> 27:37.376
This is pretty much the only
thing I'm serious about,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.231
so I need to hear you say it.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.549
I understand.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.669
Isaac!

28:02.760 --> 28:03.795
Isaac!

28:03.880 --> 28:04.949
Isaac!

28:05.040 --> 28:06.268
Isaac, don't do this!

28:11.960 --> 28:14.679
Please! Isaac!

28:19.000 --> 28:20.638
Isaac! Please!

28:28.800 --> 28:29.869
Isaac.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.114
It's the beginning...

28:39.600 --> 28:40.669
And the end.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.875
The alpha...

28:43.960 --> 28:45.313
And the omega.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.518
Do you hear the ticking?

28:55.280 --> 28:57.840
Well, I have scoured
the crawl space.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.232
I found a dead mouse,
but no clock.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.671
You think reading that for the millionth
time will turn up something new?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.108
No, not really.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.160
So, you've told Lewis
everything?

29:13.320 --> 29:14.548
Well, not everything.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.388
I think you should.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.394
Isaac may be dead,
but he is still dangerous.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.034
If Lewis knew the truth...

29:22.120 --> 29:24.536
Well, we don't know the truth.
We don't know where the clock is,

29:24.560 --> 29:26.630
or what it does,
except something horrible.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.437
No, we gotta do
the responsible thing.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.200
Lie to the kid.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.392
I can't believe
you did that.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.793
Hey, Lewis.
Hmm?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.836
Why do you wear
those goggles?

29:53.200 --> 29:55.236
Captain Midnight wears
a pair just like these.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.068
You ever seen his show?
He's indomitable.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.029
He's what?

30:00.280 --> 30:03.670
Indomitable. Adjective.
Impossible to defeat.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.516
That's what they call him. The
indomitable Captain Midnight.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.589
I just think it might be easier
for you, if you lost the goggles.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.551
Acted a little more,
you know,

30:17.400 --> 30:18.515
normal.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.029
Oh.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.875
You think?

30:23.960 --> 30:25.240
I'm just telling you
as a friend.

30:28.440 --> 30:31.910
Right. Friends.
We're friends.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.136
That'd be swell.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.160
Lewis!

30:35.240 --> 30:37.096
- We could play jacks.
- I love jacks, yeah.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.314
Lewis!

30:38.920 --> 30:42.151
Can't you see me?
Over here, right here!

30:42.720 --> 30:45.518
Lewis! It's your uncle,
Johnny!

30:45.600 --> 30:46.749
I should go.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.354
Probably.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.432
Come on, let's go! Get in.
Where's your goggles?

30:52.520 --> 30:53.589
What are you
doing here?

30:53.680 --> 30:55.033
Oh, we gotta
get some supplies.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.872
Got a harvest moon tonight,
it's perfect.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.435
Perfect for what?

30:59.760 --> 31:01.955
For your first big-time,
serious spell.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.576
Should I punch it? You won't
believe what this thing can do.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.238
Can we just go, please?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.256
Well, doggone,
that moon'll be gone next week

31:08.280 --> 31:09.508
with the lunar eclipse comin'.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.113
Till then, let's
keep on rocking.

31:11.920 --> 31:17.153
"From Saturn to the sun,
from the beast to noble one,

31:17.240 --> 31:19.834
"like the alchemists of old,

31:19.920 --> 31:22.832
"turn this dross lead
into gold!"

31:24.200 --> 31:29.069
Wow. That was
really, really...

31:31.720 --> 31:35.190
Terrible. I mean, just awful.
Hey!

31:35.400 --> 31:37.356
You're reading it
like it's a Buick manual.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.114
It's not what
you say, Lewis,

31:40.640 --> 31:42.039
it's how you say it.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.951
You're the only you
in the whole universe.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.556
That makes your style
of magic just crazy unique.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.150
One in a hundred million
kajillion.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.357
So, I can give you the right
books, teach you the right spells,

31:55.440 --> 31:58.273
but that last 1%,
that's up to you.

31:59.440 --> 32:05.197
So, how do I find my magic
style? Or whatever it is.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.836
It's in there somewhere. You just
have to quiet down and listen.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.033
Now it looks like
you're pooping.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.193
Well, I don't know!
This all feels weird.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.508
What's wrong with weird?

32:20.560 --> 32:21.993
Weird's like the nuts
in my cookies,

32:22.080 --> 32:24.036
it's the nuts that
make things interesting.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.429
Let me show you
what a little weird can do.

32:39.920 --> 32:43.310
You be a dear? Fetch a knife
and stab me in the ears.

33:43.880 --> 33:47.953
Well, for a boy who loves words,
you're sure at a loss for them.

33:49.560 --> 33:53.792
Uncle Jonathan, you're way more
than just a parlor magician.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.159
Have a look around.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.110
Finally. A smile.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.995
I was starting to think you
were incapable.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.353
Bad kitty!

34:55.440 --> 34:57.032
You use the litter box!

34:58.840 --> 35:00.910
All right.
I'm going to bed.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.629
You're welcome to stay up as
long as you like, of course.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.432
Uncle Jonathan?
Hmm?

35:06.520 --> 35:08.636
Tonight, that was
the most splendor...

35:09.920 --> 35:11.353
Splendortast...

35:12.040 --> 35:13.109
Splendorific.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.159
I don't know the word yet,
but thank you.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.276
I just wish that I met you
a long time ago.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.155
Yeah, me, too.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.589
Good night.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.269
Why didn't I?

35:29.520 --> 35:30.794
How come you left home?

35:31.560 --> 35:33.869
Well...

35:34.920 --> 35:37.832
Truth is, my father,
your grandpa,

35:38.640 --> 35:39.868
didn't like magic.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.436
And he sure didn't like
me messing around with it.

35:43.320 --> 35:44.753
We fought about it and...

35:45.080 --> 35:50.279
And we fought some more,
until finally I just took off.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.271
I was the black swan
of the family.

35:56.800 --> 35:57.869
It's a black sheep.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.034
Mmm, pretty sure
it's "swan."

36:03.280 --> 36:06.272
Is that why you didn't
go to Mom and Dad's funeral?

36:10.360 --> 36:12.715
I don't really think
she would've wanted me there.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.749
I don't know.
She missed you.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.999
She talked about you
all the time.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.154
Good night.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.029
Uncle Jonathan.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.640
I think...

36:37.160 --> 36:39.230
I think that I might be
a black swan, too.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.430
Well, then I guess
we're a flock of swans.

36:45.960 --> 36:46.995
A bevy.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.118
It's called a bevy of swans.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.439
Right.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.268
Guys! I'm floating!

37:30.760 --> 37:31.829
Wait, wait.
Oh. Uh, just...

37:31.920 --> 37:33.751
I don't know! JONATHAN:
Levitaius dominungus!

37:34.000 --> 37:37.072
- Put me? Chair! Chair! Guys!
- Just. No, I...

37:39.560 --> 37:41.516
No, no, that's not the right...
Fiddlesticks.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
Just get the...

37:44.000 --> 37:46.036
Just one. Just...

37:46.120 --> 37:47.838
Come on!

37:47.920 --> 37:49.256
- The bell's gonna ring.
- Hurry up!

37:49.280 --> 37:50.336
- Hurry up.
- Move it.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.794
- Mmm... Mmm!
- Seriously, are you almost done?

37:52.880 --> 37:54.279
Please, hurry up!

37:54.360 --> 37:56.440
Water to the face
at a very high-speed pace.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.710
Shut up! Shut up!
Stop laughing! It's not funny!

38:11.040 --> 38:15.511
You can control the energy
if you focus and channel it.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.076
Won't it kill me?
Not if you focus.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.351
Then you are
the conductor. Watch.

38:24.600 --> 38:25.794
Show me what you got.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.388
Oh, Chair!

38:33.480 --> 38:34.754
Sorry, Chair!

38:35.520 --> 38:37.670
Ooh...

38:37.760 --> 38:38.909
Not bad.

38:48.720 --> 38:49.914
Oh...

39:24.280 --> 39:27.750
Three gongs, Florence.
Last time it was four, now it's three.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.518
What happens when
it gets down to one?

39:30.160 --> 39:32.071
We'll hide in the basement
like sensible people.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.879
Okay, this is no time for jokes.
Things have changed.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.548
I know.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.319
Lewis.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.592
What happens if he's here
when it goes off?

39:42.680 --> 39:45.433
He won't be. Because we are
going to find it.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.595
We just have to
hold it together.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.516
Okay.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.595
I'm sorry.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.668
Let me get some butter.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.559
Plaid button-down, please.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.520
And will the indomitable Captain Midnight

40:27.600 --> 40:29.750
defeat the dastardly
Comrade Ivan?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.069
Maybe later, okay?

40:33.560 --> 40:36.677
Come on! I'm gonna be late!

40:37.000 --> 40:38.513
- See ya!
- Toodles.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.376
I'm getting out of here.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.834
No, stop!
You ain't going anywhere.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.518
I foolishly
walked into a trap.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.232
Why, you double-crossing...
Stay.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.360
I'll have your life for this.

40:56.760 --> 40:57.795
Yes!

41:00.520 --> 41:01.919
Oop. Chair.

41:02.080 --> 41:05.197
And the winner of the fourth
grade class president election is...

41:05.560 --> 41:07.278
Tarby Corrigan!

41:11.080 --> 41:12.115
Thank you.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.988
Tarby. Excuse me.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.590
Tarby! Congratulations, Tarby.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.829
Thanks, Lewis.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.216
If you want, I can bring some
cookies tomorrow and celebrate.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.879
Yeah, Tarby. Go have a cookie
picnic here with the little runt.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.515
Woody!

41:25.600 --> 41:26.874
Just...

41:27.320 --> 41:28.514
I'll catch up later.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.838
Hey, you got your cast off.
Do you wanna go hit some balls?

41:34.840 --> 41:36.432
Sorry. The boys and me...

41:37.280 --> 41:38.633
We're gonna explore
Wilder Creek.

41:39.240 --> 41:40.434
Maybe another time.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.712
I've got something
way better than that.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.595
Oh, yeah?

41:47.080 --> 41:48.274
My house.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.431
Everyone's wrong, you know.
It's not haunted.

41:51.520 --> 41:52.748
It's magic.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.509
Magic?

41:58.040 --> 41:59.234
Magic's not real.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.114
It is real.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.874
My uncle.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.590
He's a warlock.
That's a boy witch, and...

42:06.280 --> 42:08.430
I can teach you spells
to throw a curveball,

42:08.520 --> 42:13.071
or hit a home run, or throw a
touchdown every single time.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.589
Cross my heart.
You can see for yourself.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.799
So where is it already,
you evil, old coot?

43:07.360 --> 43:08.839
The arm.

43:41.480 --> 43:42.799
Blasted pigeons.

44:33.720 --> 44:34.914
Got you.

44:36.160 --> 44:39.072
I'll find you that curveball
spell. Just give me a sec.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.512
Whoa, what's in there?

44:44.440 --> 44:45.509
Oh, um...

44:47.360 --> 44:48.480
We're not allowed
to open it.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.674
Oh, yeah? Why not?

44:51.760 --> 44:53.910
I don't know, but
it's my uncle's only rule.

44:54.600 --> 44:55.715
Besides, it's locked.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.355
No. It's not.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.471
Tarby, I mean it. We can't.

45:10.440 --> 45:11.800
Don't be
such a scaredy-cat.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.272
Maybe it's the spell
you're looking for.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.149
No!

45:36.600 --> 45:39.239
What's "necromancy"?

45:39.560 --> 45:43.269
Noun. The practice of communicating
with the dead or raising them to life!

45:43.760 --> 45:44.829
Let's put it back.

45:45.600 --> 45:46.600
Raising the dead?

45:47.000 --> 45:48.274
Now, that would
be a trick.

45:55.560 --> 45:56.560
Put it back!

45:56.680 --> 45:58.716
We have to put it back right now!
Stop! Ow.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.516
Fine!
None of it's real anyways.

46:03.840 --> 46:04.875
It's all just weird.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.400
You're just weird.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.555
Was that the Corrigan boy?

46:17.360 --> 46:19.430
He was just leaving.
What were you two doing?

46:20.000 --> 46:21.194
Nothing.

46:21.280 --> 46:23.555
Uncle Jonathan, do you
wanna play ball with me?

46:23.640 --> 46:25.915
I can't right now. There's
something I need to look into.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.240
Later, okay?

46:28.320 --> 46:30.231
Okay.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.438
Isaac hid the room with
a hex so no one would find these,

46:38.520 --> 46:40.556
but I can't make
heads or tails of this.

46:40.640 --> 46:42.835
I know about
every magic language there is.

46:42.920 --> 46:46.799
The Alberti Cipher, the Enochian
Glyphs, but this...

46:47.400 --> 46:48.469
Really?

46:49.160 --> 46:52.357
Well, at least I lived to see the
purple pachyderm get stumped.

46:52.440 --> 46:55.193
I don't know how much longer any
of us will be living, weird beard.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.599
Cranky old crone.
Mush brush.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.517
Hag face.
Oh, go braid your back hair.

46:58.680 --> 47:01.114
I'd give you a nasty look,
but you've already got one.

47:01.200 --> 47:04.988
Okay, okay,
you old yeti. Now, look.

47:08.440 --> 47:10.670
What does this
mean to you?

47:10.760 --> 47:11.875
The omega.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.758
Isaac talked about it
when he died.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.238
The last letter
of the Greek alphabet.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.675
And in early Christianity...

47:22.440 --> 47:23.919
It means Judgment Day.

47:38.600 --> 47:39.880
You all right, kiddo?

47:42.120 --> 47:43.269
I'm okay.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.792
You always were
a lousy liar.

47:52.880 --> 47:53.915
You're lonely, huh?

47:55.360 --> 47:57.715
I just wish Jonathan
wasn't so busy.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.237
I wish he could spend
more time with you.

48:03.480 --> 48:04.515
It's okay.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.668
What about Tarby?

48:09.120 --> 48:10.951
Tarby hates me.
Oh.

48:11.560 --> 48:13.869
You can fix that. Easy.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.957
Just show him
some real magic.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.593
I can't do any real magic.

48:18.680 --> 48:19.908
Yes, you can.

48:20.360 --> 48:23.989
With the book, silly.
The one I told you to find.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.350
Well, you found it,
didn't you?

48:27.640 --> 48:28.709
Book?

48:28.840 --> 48:30.876
You mean the necromancy book
in the library?

48:31.560 --> 48:33.516
Uncle Jonathan told me
never to even touch it.

48:33.600 --> 48:37.195
Oh, he won't mind.
He's too busy, anyways.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.677
Take the book.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.512
Show Tarby a real trick.

48:44.520 --> 48:47.592
He's gonna be your friend again.
I know it.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.840
Tarby's a jerk, you know?

48:56.400 --> 48:59.631
He runs for president every year and
he's always nice until the election.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.953
After that,

49:03.640 --> 49:05.756
he goes back to being, him.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.234
You don't need him.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.670
We could go look for spiders.

49:11.560 --> 49:12.879
If you want.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.834
Just leave me alone, okay?

49:24.080 --> 49:25.229
Tarby!

49:27.960 --> 49:30.349
Okay. You wanna see
some real magic?

49:30.720 --> 49:31.789
I'll show you.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.713
Yeah? You gonna
saw a lady in half?

49:36.280 --> 49:37.554
I'm gonna raise the dead.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.715
You're a liar. No one
can raise the dead.

49:40.800 --> 49:41.949
Watch me.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.708
Unless...

49:44.120 --> 49:45.314
Unless you're scared.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.317
You need a babysitter? Fine.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.881
But this whole thing is just
gonna be a big waste of time.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.555
When?

50:25.720 --> 50:26.994
Tarby!

50:27.920 --> 50:29.069
Tarby?

50:45.880 --> 50:46.949
Boo!

50:48.360 --> 50:49.839
Tarby, that's not funny!

50:51.160 --> 50:52.354
It is from here.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.430
Well, come on,
smart guy.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.714
Who are we
gonna wake up?

51:02.720 --> 51:03.994
How about this one?

51:05.160 --> 51:08.040
The lamb means that it's a kid's grave,
and I don't wanna raise up a kid.

51:09.960 --> 51:11.234
It's creepy
that you know that.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.189
This way, I think.

51:23.240 --> 51:25.834
Nice trick with the book, Lewis.
I know that's you.

51:25.920 --> 51:27.353
No, it's not.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.394
Is that it?

51:32.040 --> 51:33.871
Yeah, I think so.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.348
Well, come on.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.559
Okay.

52:17.360 --> 52:20.750
"For thou who sleeps
in stone and clay,

52:21.360 --> 52:23.794
"heed this call,
rise up and obey.

52:24.280 --> 52:29.434
"Trek on through the mortal door,
assemble flesh and walk once more."

52:34.120 --> 52:35.439
So, what now?

52:36.720 --> 52:38.870
That's it.
That's all it says.

52:40.480 --> 52:42.710
See, told you
all this was a huge...

52:50.920 --> 52:51.989
Tarby?

52:53.640 --> 52:54.868
Tarby!

54:07.480 --> 54:09.038
Could you put
those back, please?

54:14.800 --> 54:15.896
He's coming home.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.229
He's free. He's back!

54:27.040 --> 54:32.751
He's coming home. He's awake.
He's back! He's coming home.

54:32.840 --> 54:36.515
He's coming home.
He's awake! He's back!

54:36.600 --> 54:40.718
He's coming home.
He's coming home.

54:41.200 --> 54:43.395
That's not creepy.

54:57.840 --> 55:00.673
Who'd be crazy enough
to bring Isaac Izard back?

55:00.760 --> 55:02.398
Someone suicidal.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.277
The house knows he's back.
Can you feel that?

55:08.960 --> 55:12.794
Like a dog with rabies.
Knows his master's coming home.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.910
I'm gonna need your help
on this one, Florence.

55:16.040 --> 55:18.395
My magic won't be enough.
I'm barely qualified as it is.

55:18.480 --> 55:21.040
I can't.
I'll just mess it up.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.996
I can't do this alone.
We won't have to. Lewis.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.856
What about Lewis?
He's stronger than you know.

55:25.880 --> 55:29.350
And one and a half warlocks is better
than nothing. Just tell him the truth.

55:29.440 --> 55:32.193
No. He's just a boy. You're the
smartest witch I've ever known.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.960
You can cast spells
I can't even pronounce.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.439
I said I can't.

55:40.040 --> 55:41.040
I can't.

55:43.240 --> 55:44.240
I'm sorry.

55:45.960 --> 55:50.078
Look, Isaac is coming back and
we can't let him get inside.

55:51.560 --> 55:56.236
Well, if your magic is
off-limits, then what's the plan?

55:57.120 --> 55:58.712
I can still swing a hammer.

56:15.680 --> 56:19.798
These are crazy people,
Marmalade. Crazy people.

56:22.840 --> 56:24.720
Do you think these are enough
to keep Isaac out?

56:24.760 --> 56:27.354
Oh, yes. Maybe.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.149
I'm gonna get some more.

56:50.760 --> 56:51.760
Uncle Jonathan?

56:51.840 --> 56:55.799
Don't come up! I'm...
I'm coming down.

57:01.560 --> 57:04.597
Listen, I need
to talk to you.

57:04.680 --> 57:08.355
Not a great time, Lewis.
I'm working on a heavy-duty spell.

57:08.440 --> 57:10.715
I want you to stay
at Mrs. Z's for a few days.

57:10.800 --> 57:13.598
Come on. I see the horseshoes.
I know something's wrong.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.336
What are you talking about?
Everything's fine.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.588
No. It's not.

57:17.160 --> 57:21.438
You're right, Lewis. Something is wrong.
Something is very wrong.

57:21.520 --> 57:23.112
Florence...
He's got eyes, Jonathan.

57:24.320 --> 57:27.039
It's our friend, Isaac Izard.
Except he's not our friend.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.270
He's very wicked,
very powerful.

57:29.360 --> 57:32.079
And I'm afraid he's back
from the great beyond.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.471
Yeah. That's what
I wanted to talk to...

57:34.560 --> 57:37.438
And when we find out who's
raised him from the dead,

57:37.520 --> 57:40.398
they are going to
be sorry. Very sorry.

57:40.480 --> 57:41.629
Oh.

57:42.160 --> 57:44.549
Mmm, yeah, they...
They sure will.

57:45.360 --> 57:49.558
Look, the truth is,
it's not safe for you here.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.914
At least, not now.

57:51.680 --> 57:55.753
So, go next door with Florence, okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

58:07.720 --> 58:09.560
Maybe just once more
around the block...

58:09.640 --> 58:11.073
Sure, no problem.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.193
Come on.

58:14.600 --> 58:15.828
Mrs. Zimmerman?

58:15.920 --> 58:17.672
Uh, I'm sorry, dear?

58:18.440 --> 58:19.440
What are you doing?

58:19.840 --> 58:21.353
I'm just trying...

58:25.920 --> 58:26.920
Nothing.

58:33.680 --> 58:34.680
Wait.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.554
Isaac and Uncle Jonathan
used to perform together?

58:39.240 --> 58:40.559
They did everything together.

58:43.320 --> 58:44.992
They were best friends.

58:45.080 --> 58:46.080
They were?

58:47.160 --> 58:48.160
Once.

58:54.600 --> 58:58.559
Isaac was an orphan.
And Jonathan, a runaway.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.633
Neither of them had family.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.071
All they had was magic.

59:08.760 --> 59:09.760
And each other.

59:11.240 --> 59:13.037
Then, Isaac went away to war.

59:13.760 --> 59:16.479
He was fighting in Germany
when he went MIA.

59:17.280 --> 59:18.280
Months passed.

59:18.880 --> 59:21.633
Then, suddenly,
Isaac came back home.

59:23.120 --> 59:24.872
But it wasn't the same Isaac.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.240
He was different.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.115
And angry.

59:32.440 --> 59:35.876
And more powerful than any
warlock had the right to be.

59:36.760 --> 59:39.513
How? What happened to him?

59:40.720 --> 59:45.589
We don't know. All he said was,
he was lost in the Black Forest.

59:47.000 --> 59:51.949
Now, that is a very old place
with very old magic.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.840
It's where the Brothers Grimm
wrote their histories.

59:55.240 --> 59:56.719
You mean their fairy-tales?

59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.191
Now, we think that Isaac met
a dark warlock in those woods.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.311
A teacher who gave him some
terrifying, forbidden books.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.629
One of which
is so dangerous

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.757
that your uncle keeps it
locked up in his cabinet.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.792
Then, Isaac abandoned
poor Jonathan.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.397
No explanation. And he found
himself a witch. Selena.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.472
So spiteful and mean,
he married her.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.795
And they locked themselves
away in the house.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.191
Until one night last year,

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.436
Isaac performed a blood magic
ritual that killed him.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.560
What was
the ritual for?

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.509
To make a key.
A clock key of human bone.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.518
We think his wife's bones.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.839
We think Isaac killed
Selena to make it.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.034
Uncle Jonathan said that you were a
really good witch. Even better than him.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920
I was.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.720
Once.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.714
My magic was
the toast of Paris.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.431
You should've seen me
before the war.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.399
I melted Salvador Dali's watch
one time, right off his wrist.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.519
Then why can't
you help us?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.351
You know how magic
comes from the inside?

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.350
Well, I got hurt one time.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160
Pretty badly.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.877
And even though my outsides got
better, my insides never did.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.868
And so, now, every time I try
to work any real magic,

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.828
it just comes out broken.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.791
Now,

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.598
there's very few problems in the world
that can't, at least, be helped

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.478
by a good chocolate
chip cookie.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.632
Tarby. Tarby!

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.233
Not now, Lewis,
I'm late for gym.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.311
No, now. We gotta talk now!
What?

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.936
- Let go!
- Where do you think you're going, huh?

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.235
The other night, what we did
in the cemetery...

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.073
We did something awful.
My uncle's in trouble. We all are, and...

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.434
See, there's this clock...

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:36.429
Lewis! Just stop. Nothing
happened in that cemetery.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.155
Look, I get it, you're scared.
I am, too. We're the...

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.151
Woody!

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.309
Tarby, get off me!

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.560
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Let's go!

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.519
Good morning, Miss Fisher.
Woody.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.033
I'm not scared.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.232
And if you tell anyone I was there,
I'll break both your arms.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.080
You're just a weirdo.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.200
"Indomitable."

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.630
Uncle Jonathan?
You in here?

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.800
No way.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.077
Help me! Help, please! Help!

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.711
Uncle Jonathan! Uncle Jonathan!
Help! Help me, please!

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.149
Come on. Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.228
Get those papers!

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.716
You all right?

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.030
What are you doing here?
I told you it's not safe!

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.073
I was being indomitable.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.512
I suppose you were,
weren't you?

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.879
You can't do this alone.
You need help, and I can help you!

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.995
No, you can't.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.878
Actually, I can. 'Cause
I know how to read this.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.992
But I'm gonna need
some Ovaltine.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.794
Wait. I don't understand.
You've seen this code before?

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.515
Yes. Comrade Ivan uses one just like it
to send commands to his Red Brigade.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600
"Comrade" who?

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.120
Comrade Ivan
from the TV show.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.470
But Captain Midnight always
stops him and decodes it

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.278
with, uh...

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.348
This! The Captain Midnight
secret decoder pin.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.792
I don't believe it.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.199
I don't believe it!

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.193
Three Ovaltine shakes,
please.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.677
"With this clock, Selena and I shall
wipe this filthy world clean."

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.511
It's a doomsday clock.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.029
In a way,
it destroys everything.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.635
But not by ending the world,
but sending it back to the beginning.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:57.117
If the planet is one giant clock, then this
damn thing is the winder.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.793
He's winding it back
to the very beginning of time!

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.348
So, everything goes in reverse.
We grow younger and younger

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.835
until we vanish.
Until there's no one left.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.830
I knew Isaac
was strong, but

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.514
this goes beyond anything I
ever thought he was capable of.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.480
When's it happen?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.955
"When night's
at its blackest."

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:24.191
The total lunar eclipse. Tonight!
All those moons painted in my bedroom.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.113
What if Isaac was studying them
and waiting for the right moment?

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.475
That's what the gongs
are counting down to.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.119
We'll take
the gumballs, too.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.433
Isaac's been here.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.837
Isaac pulled
all the horseshoes off?

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.036
Burned 'em off.
One by one.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.236
Like ants
with a magnifying glass.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.277
Just how
powerful is he now?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.749
Death's been good to him.
Wait here.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.755
Chair! It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm here to help.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.073
Here, it's okay. It's okay.
You're okay.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.638
He's torn the place
to pieces.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.637
He must have been
looking for something.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.959
And I think I know what.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.678
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get rid of it.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.879
Uh, shouldn't this be
melting right now?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.513
Too much John
the Conqueror root.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.120
No. Not enough Goofer Dust.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.400
Oh.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.360
Grains of paradise.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.536
We don't have
any Grains of Paradise.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.376
You know what?
Maybe a pinch of motherwort.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.896
- Uncle Jonathan.
- What about some Lotus root?

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.638
Yeah, yeah.
More Lotus root.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.358
Uncle Jonathan.
Hmm?

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.109
This is my fault.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.912
Lewis, you helped us. You're the
one who decoded the blueprints.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
No.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.874
I mean, I'm the one
who brought Isaac back.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.160
Lewis?

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:21.510
What are you
talking about?

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.234
I opened the cabinet.
I used your book.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.399
I'm so, so, so sorry.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.496
You couldn't have. You don't know enough
magic to pull off a spell like that.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.272
I just followed
the directions.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.959
I bled onto the book.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.312
Oh, Lewis.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.519
Blood magic?

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.679
That was my one rule.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.877
I know. I'm sorry.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.269
And you broke it?
I didn't mean to.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.270
So, you opened
a forbidden cabinet,

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:55.636
and performed an unholy ritual,
on accident?

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.392
Jonathan...
I didn't know Isaac was evil.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:58.479
You never told me.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.709
Oh, so this is my fault?

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.835
I didn't say that.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.309
Then, what are you saying?

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.799
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.269
I just wanted Tarby
to be my friend again!

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.196
And I want my parents back!

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.496
And I figured
if it worked here,

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.750
I could go home
and try it on them.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.192
I just want my mom!

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:22.279
I'm sorry.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.709
It was a mistake.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.953
You coming here.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.076
Now, hold on, Jonathan.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.711
No! No, please!
Please. I'll make it up to you. Please.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.469
No. This is no place
for a kid.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:41.591
It's not safe for you here. I was
wrong to ever think that it was.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.117
But we're a bevy of swans!

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.115
I'm sorry.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.837
You stay here.
Let me talk to him.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.035
I know I've got a Malleus
Maleficarum around here somewhere.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.072
Should help with the key.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.517
Go ahead, yell at me,
call me some names.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.280
No names.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320
Not this time.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760
Jonathan,

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.398
that little boy needs you.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.833
But what he did...

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.273
He's a child.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.390
Children make mistakes.
They get in trouble.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.674
That's why they're children.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.515
No, this is not swiping a comic
book, Florence. This is...

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.558
I don't have a choice here.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.073
Of course you do.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.313
You could stick it out!

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.352
No, no, when the going gets tough,
you get going, right for the exit.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.951
Like how you ran away
from your family.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.917
Ran away?
My dad threw me out!

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.831
And what about
your little sister?

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.959
She'd looked up to you.
She needed you, and now she's gone.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.270
And you're going to abandon
her only child.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.516
Look, I don't know
how to take care of a kid.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.434
How to talk to him, how to keep him safe.
Especially now! I'm just...

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.555
You're scared.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.111
Yes, all right? I'm scared for Lewis!
Scared he'll get hurt!

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.560
Well,
guess what, genius?

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.628
That is the whole point.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.313
You having a child means
being scared for them 24/7

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.515
and doing it anyway.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.151
It's the whole damn
job description.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.998
And I would give everything
to have that job again.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.911
To have my little
girl back, to...

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.155
You know what?

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.349
I do have a name for you.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.473
Jonathan Barnavelt,
you're a coward!

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.315
Mrs. Hanchett! Mrs. Hanchett!

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.790
Lewis.
He's free! We gotta go now!

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.136
Well, who, what are
we talking about?

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.296
There is someone
in your house.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.389
Please. Hurry!
Who?

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.914
Come on.
Take Marmalade. Wait.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.680
Come on. Hurry, please!
We don't care about the door.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.795
What? Lewis, it's cold.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.456
He's upstairs. I saw him!
Oh, my God, it's a step.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.536
He's in your house
right now!

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.154
- Lewis! Lewis!
- Please! Hurry.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.913
Lewis, wait! Hold on.
It's slippery. Hurry. Come on.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.400
Please hurry,
Mrs. Hanchett! Please!

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.431
Lewis, it's slippery.
Lewis, stop!

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.988
You're not making any sense.
What bad man?

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.599
His name is Isaac.
Isaac Izard.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.355
Isaac Izard? Lewis, he's dead.
He died last year.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.069
Stay here.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.435
Uncle Jonathan!
Mrs. Zimmerman!

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.637
It's locked.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.558
It must be Isaac.
Out of the way.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.176
Mrs. Hanchett,
get away from the door.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.713
Don't be ridiculous.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800
No!

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.234
Hello, Lewis.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.113
Hmm.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.594
Mmm.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.789
Stay away from her.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:42.195
Why should I stay away
from my beautiful wife?

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.799
You're Selena Izard?

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.797
In the flesh.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.153
Uncle Jonathan!

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.280
Lewis!

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400
But, you died.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.913
Whoever said I died?

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.512
- Isaac!
- Isaac!

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.600
Isaac!

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.496
- Isaac!
- Isaac!

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.520
No!

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.794
Is that bone?

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600
Human.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.438
He killed her to make
some sort of key.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.336
I thought it was made from...

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.191
Not my bone, no.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.915
That was a chunk
from the real Mrs. Hanchett.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.640
Lovely woman.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.200
That is, before I killed her
and took her place.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.714
Mmm, my wife,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.673
she has a talent
for disguises.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.354
I learn from the best.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.998
Aw.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.911
Come give
your mommy a kiss.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280
You.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.034
It was you in my dreams.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.634
I couldn't get near that locked cabinet.
The charms were too strong.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.633
But you, you could get
that nasty, old book for me.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.518
Raise Isaac for me.
You could do everything I wanted.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.520
And now,

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.269
you are going to get us
that clock key.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.677
No, no, not that,
not there.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.236
Whoa, whoa!

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:16.800
Whew!

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.555
Hmm.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.675
Well, come on.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.469
Now you're just showing off.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.600
Lewis!

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.313
Lewis!
Lewis, where are you?

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.599
Isaac took him.
Yes, but where?

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.315
I think I know.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.633
Uncle Jonathan!
Lewis!

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.336
- Mrs. Zimmerman, I'm over here.
- We're coming.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.360
I'm over here!

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.158
Uncle Jonathan,
over here!

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.357
No, here! No,
over here! Help me.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.832
Barnavelt and Izard,
masters of prestidigitation,

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.994
beloved by the crowned
heads of Europe, together again.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.272
I'm sure you'll remember
my next trick.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.560
- No!
- No.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.710
Uncle Jonathan!
Isaac, don't do this!

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.752
I like the boy.

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.752
An orphan with a love
for Captain Midnight?

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.918
Mmm, warms my dead heart.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.397
Please don't
make me butcher him.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.800
Give me the key.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.829
You don't have to hurt anyone.
Just tell us, where is the clock

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.309
The clock is under
a witch's hex.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.673
You'll never find it.
This is over.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:57.795
Isaac, please.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.576
There must be some part of you
that doesn't want this,

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.239
that isn't completely dead.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.916
I was dead
long before I died.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.638
We know you went through something
awful during the war, we all did!

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.068
Oh, on the contrary.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.553
It's where
I met my teacher.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.116
My unit had been
caught in an ambush.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.835
Everyone slaughtered.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.233
I'd been left for dead.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.278
I stumbled through
the Black Forest for days.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.319
I chanted every spell I knew,
with one thought only.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.075
"Make me powerful enough
to end this!"

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.910
To erase the horrors
I had witnessed.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.272
When I opened my eyes,

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I saw him.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.356
He offered me
something to drink.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.398
For a small price, of course.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.119
Suddenly, I had it.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.871
The blueprints
for the clock...

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.034
...in my mind.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.475
Clear as day.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.749
That wasn't a warlock.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.073
It wasn't even a human.
It was a demon, you reckless idiot!

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.536
You summoned a demon!

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.596
Yes! Yes.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.593
"Azazel," to be exact.
The fourth prince of Hell.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.672
Oh, he gave me
a wonderful gift.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.478
The greatest magic trick ever.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.279
I'm going to make
people disappear.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.476
Spin the world back,
until the dawn of time.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.073
All that will be left...

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.228
Selena and I.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.030
But if you go back
to the beginning,

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.677
history, humans, it will all
just start over again.

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.760
No.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.714
I'll make sure people
are never born this time,

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.192
with the help of a friend.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.874
Lewis' parents won't die
in that awful crash.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:08.040
Your husband and sweet little
girl won't be killed.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.112
They'll never
have existed.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.393
No people, no war.

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.319
Now, Jonathan,

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.188
the key.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Florence,

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.878
now would be a good time
for a little magic.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.999
Of all people, Florence,
I thought you'd want this.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.557
I know what losing
your family did to you.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.388
You're too sad and broken
to work any real magic.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.949
Maybe I was.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.948
But now,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.638
I'm indomitable.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.315
Ha-ha!

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.951
Marmalade! Now!

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.589
Where are they?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.069
They're gone.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.350
Mind your step.
There's a tongue.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.160
- There's a big tongue.
- I've got it.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.669
So

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.315
creepy.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.199
Time for this little boy to go.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.397
Uncle Jonathan!
Uncle Jonathan!

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.656
Be careful!

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.069
Lewis! Don't freak them out!

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.176
Unhand me! Let me go! Oh, no!
Put me down! Stop! Put me down!

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.430
Mommy. Mommy.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.960
Why won't you talk to me?
Why won't you talk to me?

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.758
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.272
- Wait, wait. Jonathan!
- Mrs. Zimmerman!

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.998
Let me go! Let go of me!

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.195
Jonathan!

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.959
Son of a...

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.396
- Lewis. You okay?
- I'm okay.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.629
Would you look at that?

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.760
Okay,
let's get back in there.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.576
What? With those creepy,
metal monsters inside?

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.640
They'll tear us to shreds!

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.760
Florence,
we have to find Isaac and Selena.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.776
We don't know
where in the house they are.

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.600
No. But if we wait around,
we know something bad will happen.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.496
You heard Isaac.
He's using the witch's hex!

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.256
I understand that. So, should we just sit
around and try to figure out the hex?

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.456
We don't have time!
No. We need a plan!

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.549
Guys!

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.872
Oh, my giddy aunt.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.816
Don't worry, their teeth
are made of pumpkin,

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.909
they can't really hurt us.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.069
Okay, I made that up.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.870
It's some kind of
ungodly adhesive!

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.669
I'm stuck!

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.555
Me, too!

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.718
You know, I didn't think
this is how I was gonna die.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.958
Look! Mrs. Zimmerman,
grab my shirt!

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.109
I've got you!

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.629
- Just chop. Chop, chop!
- Lewis! Hurry!

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.795
God,
I hate pumpkins.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.376
Did you see that, Florence?

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.153
I exploded it with a psychic
energy blast! It worked!

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.360
Yes, Jonathan,
we're all very proud of you!

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.216
Did you see
that I now have the power?

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.760
Yes,
I understand. Gold star.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.440
Ha-ha!

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.633
Uncle Jonathan.
Uncle Jonathan, it's me, please wake up!

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.896
Jonathan. Jonathan,
you've got to get up! Uncle Jonathan.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.319
You've got to get up
right now!

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.510
What are you looking at,
you shriveled old prune?

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.792
I'm looking at you,
you dumb baby orangutan.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.076
Aw, Lewis.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.832
Oh, Florence,
you missed a spot.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.634
Lewis. I'm sorry, Lewis.
I'm sorry about everything.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.836
It's okay. Me, too.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.216
Don't get me wrong,
uh, this is lovely,

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.913
but there's only
18 minutes to the eclipse.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.039
And they've got the key.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.348
How do we find the clock?

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.875
We can't.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.840
It's got a witch's hex on it.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.896
And that means it's hidden
from every witch or warlock,

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.069
no matter how powerful.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.119
Not even Florence
could find it.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.998
There must be something
we're not thinking of.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.749
Maybe I could find it.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.239
I'm not a witch
or warlock.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.192
Well, not yet anyways, but

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.473
maybe if I tried
some magic?

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.275
Would that work?

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.432
Okay. I'm ready.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.871
Lewis, I don't know
about that eight ball.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.349
Hey, this is my magic.
Not yours.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.189
Let's go.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.712
Locate. Verb.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.110
To discover the exact place
and position of.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.673
Secret! Adjective!
Something that is kept unknown or unseen!

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.833
Clock! Noun. A mechanical device,
used for measuring time!

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:06.071
A time-piece! A horologe!

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.470
Wow. He is weird.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.635
Isn't he, though?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.797
Locate the secret clock.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.473
Locate the secret clock!

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.559
Please,
Mom and Dad.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.158
Tell me where
the clock is. Please.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.309
"Under the boiler."

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.391
Lewis, you genius!

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.669
Shall we?

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.110
Trick or treat!

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.837
- Mrs. Zimmerman?
- Hmm?

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.349
What is that?

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.953
Jonathan. Open the door.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.109
Working on it.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.231
Jonathan?

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.515
Jonathan!

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.669
That's not helping!

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.392
Lewis. Crack it open.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.718
Even in death, so creepy.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.936
Florence,
I really have to pee.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.598
Not the time, Jonathan.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.240
Snakespeare!

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.998
Mrs. Zimmerman!
Florence!

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.195
Go! Go!

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.030
It's okay, she knows how to handle
Snakespeare. Come here. Quickly.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.720
Isaac!

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.197
Stop!

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:11.871
Please. I taught you
everything you know, Jonathan.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.911
I didn't teach you
everything I know.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.229
My darling.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.839
No!

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.199
Wait there, Lewis!
No, I have to come with you.

01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:00.477
No! There may be traps.
I have protection.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.878
I feel something.
I've got it!

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.515
Uncle Jonathan!

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.398
Uncle Jonathan?
Uncle Jonathan!

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.676
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's me. Lewis, your nephew.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:03.757
Lewis! Come with us to the turret.
It's a special turret. It'll protect us.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.832
I like you, Lewis.
I like being your mom.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.993
Forget about your uncle.
Soon he'll be gone...

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.718
...like everyone else.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.075
Uncle Jonathan?
Uncle Jonathan!

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.354
Hey! I got you.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.749
What?

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.113
Mom. Dad.
What should I do?

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:14.480
"Say goodbye"?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.070
Say goodbye? I don't get it.
What do you mean?

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:28.114
Okay. Goodbye, guys.
I love you.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.074
Look, my darling.
It's beginning.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.915
The sands of time
are shifting.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.555
Quickly!

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.715
Something is wrong!

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.869
What is it?

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.712
Help me!

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.868
I want to show you
what a little weird can do.

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.799
What?

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.680
Uncle Jonathan.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.709
I'm back.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.992
You did it.
You stopped the clock!

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.360
Do not tell Florence
about the baby body.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.720
She'll never
let me live it down.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.593
I won't.
You promise?

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.511
I swear. No baby body.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.272
Warlock secret?
Never happened.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.673
You're the best. You did it.
Toss me my trousers.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.136
Not a word to Florence.
I'm serious.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.470
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat threw up.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.552
Whew!

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.232
Oh, you fixed Snakespeare!

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.952
Well, you stopped
the clock.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.554
Nah, I just wet my pants.
Literally. Lewis stopped the clock.

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.235
Lewis.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.472
You are indomitable.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.715
Mrs. Zimmerman,
I'm sorry you lost your family.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.313
I'm sorry you lost yours.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.954
But maybe would you wanna be
a black swan with us?

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.628
Can I be a purple one?

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.755
Deal.

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:40.877
I would like that
very much.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.360
I don't want
the creepy little runt.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:52.955
Think I want him?

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.080
You know what, fellas?

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.678
I don't really
wanna play anyways.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.000
Ball to the face
at a very high-speed pace.

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.640
Lucky shot.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.034
We want Lewis
on our team.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.719
No. We want him!

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:15.917
No, Lewis, come on!
Come on! Lewis, come on!

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.796
Rose Rita, right?
Mmm-hmm.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.949
Can I see your bug book?

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.878
I've seen you
with your dictionary.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.632
You know the word
is "insect."

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:32.949
But sure.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.671
Wow. You drew these?
These are really good.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.431
You look like an insect.

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.397
I mean that
as the highest compliment.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.069
That's how I take it.

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.874
I'm so excited. Like it's so...

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.960
Oh, yeah.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.748
Bye!
Bye.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.320
Who was that?

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.396
Rose Rita Pottinger.
She's a friend.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.357
She is?
Is it kissy-faced?

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.555
No, platonic.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.868
Look at him
playing it cool.

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.871
James Dean,
all of a sudden.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.597
Uncle Jonathan,
punch it.

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.159
Let's see
what this baby can do.

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.429
Hi. We're home. Hello.
Aw.

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.394
- You ready?
- Oh, yeah.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.710
Stay.

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.416
You know, Jonathan,
you drive like an old grandma.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.096
Oh, that's funny,
you look like one.

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.634
Guys, stop!
You're both super-old.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.176
Ha-ha! Nice one, Lewis.

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.315
Gold star.

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.110
Bad kitty!
Use the litter box!
