00:13.681 --> 00:16.059
<i>Watch Sergeant report to Key Control A.</i>

00:19.646 --> 00:21.606
Alright, she's good.

00:24.108 --> 00:26.236
Deputy Superintendent Harding, please.

00:26.402 --> 00:28.154
And what is your business
with the superintendent?

00:29.739 --> 00:31.366
I'm from the Public Defender's office.

00:35.328 --> 00:37.747
Mr Harding, sir, this is Officer Kane
down in Security.

00:37.956 --> 00:39.666
- There's a lawyer here--
- Sarah Pitman.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.000
...says she needs to speak to you.

00:41.334 --> 00:43.419
Uh-huh. I understand, sir.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.006
Go ahead in.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.680
Squeezing you in, Ms Pitman, so if you
wouldn't mind getting right to the point.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.890
Don't much care for lawyers,
do you, Mr Harding?

00:56.224 --> 00:57.892
It's my line of work, you understand.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.019
It's called the justice system, Mr Harding.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.854
We all play a part in seeing justice done.

01:02.689 --> 01:04.023
Goes without saying.

01:04.399 --> 01:07.443
Then why is my client, Peter Murphy,
still locked up?

01:09.112 --> 01:09.988
Beg your pardon...?

01:10.446 --> 01:12.699
His debt to society is paid, in full.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.867
He was supposed to have been
released ten days ago.

01:15.493 --> 01:16.703
Ten days, Mr Harding.

01:19.330 --> 01:20.957
- Name again?
- Peter Murphy.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.459
He's not the first prisoner unlawfully held

01:23.543 --> 01:26.170
past his court-mandated release date
at this institution.

01:26.629 --> 01:30.466
I have a file full of news clippings
in my briefcase, if you'd like to see 'em.

01:31.342 --> 01:32.218
Hm.

01:33.428 --> 01:34.387
May I see?

01:36.931 --> 01:38.600
If this release date is right,
he should be out.

01:38.891 --> 01:39.976
That's his release date.

01:40.476 --> 01:41.936
But that's not his photograph.

01:42.895 --> 01:43.771
Are you sure?

01:44.272 --> 01:48.318
I know my own client, Mr Harding.
That's his file, that's not his face.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.069
Does this happen a lot?

01:57.076 --> 02:01.539
- Well, how soon can you have him out?
- Just hold on, I'll be right back.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.602
- You getting these?
- Yeah. How'd it go?

02:22.644 --> 02:23.853
<i>He's taken the bait.</i>

02:24.312 --> 02:26.022
<i>I like that one with him and the governor.</i>

02:26.105 --> 02:27.398
I think this guy's all wrong.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.192
No, trust me, he's all right.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.527
I worry when you say "trust me."

02:31.653 --> 02:34.030
Marjorie, I spent three years in there,
I know these guys.

02:34.072 --> 02:35.448
Duane Harding's a career bureaucrat

02:35.531 --> 02:37.700
<i>who's about to retire after 30 years
on the job.</i>

02:37.825 --> 02:40.203
The last thing he wants is a lawsuit
or a scandal.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.746
It feels like very long odds.

02:41.788 --> 02:44.374
Listen, I'm telling you, we're gonna have
Pete out by nightfall.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.834
We have to cos without Pete
there's no Maggie, and with no Maggie--

02:47.293 --> 02:51.964
You're up against two guys who'll kill you
and the whole family just to find her.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.050
Fuck!

03:05.186 --> 03:08.231

03:32.463 --> 03:34.841
I know I was missing one headlight, not two.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.050
You sure?

03:36.300 --> 03:37.468
Yes, I'm sure.

03:38.636 --> 03:39.846
It may be an old piece of shit

03:39.887 --> 03:42.306
but I know how many headlights
I need to replace.

03:43.641 --> 03:47.103
The second one went missing
after I smashed into Winslow's car.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.148
But then Pete drove the truck
to the city and back.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.691
It could've been lost anywhere.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.444
Yeah, and the police could've retrieved it
at the crime scene which

03:54.736 --> 03:56.654
ties my truck to Winslow's murder.

03:58.865 --> 04:02.076
OK, I'll check evidence.

04:02.452 --> 04:03.494
In Fairfield?

04:05.580 --> 04:06.831
The case got moved to Bridgeport.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.501
Don't worry, OK.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.920
Just to be safe, let's get it replaced.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.174
But we don't want a paper trail
so get the replacements from a salvage yard

04:16.632 --> 04:17.633
pay cash.

04:17.925 --> 04:18.926
Oh, Taylor...

04:19.343 --> 04:20.803
Don't worry, Grandma, don't worry.

04:20.887 --> 04:23.139
It's all gonna be fine, OK? Alright?

04:24.223 --> 04:25.767
I'll check the evidence and call you.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.375
Hey.

04:51.417 --> 04:52.710
I yelled for you downstairs.

04:53.044 --> 04:54.587
My bad. Uh, where're the kids?

04:54.712 --> 04:58.508
Uh... I dropped Jacob at day care.
Ellen's in the kitchen having cereal.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.551
- Uh...
- Thanks for taking her to school.

05:00.635 --> 05:02.970
Yeah, my pleasure, um...
Will you be at the office?

05:04.138 --> 05:07.683
In a while. I just have this errand thing
I have to do first.

05:07.934 --> 05:09.352
That sounds mysterious.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.437
It's the DMV. Wanna come?

05:11.938 --> 05:14.565
- Uh, tempting, but--
- Didn't think so. Later.

05:21.489 --> 05:26.369
I kinda recognise the name,
but I couldn't tell you what he looks like.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.955
We got more than 1,800 inmates down there.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.540
She's right about the release date.

05:31.082 --> 05:33.584
Yeah, well... I can't explain that.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.586
I don't need you to explain it.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.048
I need you to get your ass down to cellblock,
tell me if that's his face or not.

05:39.549 --> 05:40.424
Yes, sir.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.100
Fuck.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.114
Shit!

06:03.197 --> 06:05.074
Oh, shit!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.321
Hey, watch yourself.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.365
- Sorry?
- Our friend from the NYPD just landed.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.826
She's gonna want to talk to you
about that time Winslow came in.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.203
OK, I mean there's not much to tell,
but sure.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.748
- How long's she gonna be here?
- As long as it takes.

06:54.081 --> 06:57.251
Look, keep the static to a minimum,
try to get it over as quick as we can.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.711
Like a rectal exam.

06:59.795 --> 07:00.713
Copy that.

07:08.179 --> 07:09.055
Fuck.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.643
Is that your card?

07:15.102 --> 07:15.978
Uh-uh.

07:17.104 --> 07:17.980
How about that?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.733
- Come on, now you're just guessing.
- Fuck you, I'm guessing.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.194
- You wanna raise the bet?
- Yeah.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.196
Yes, I do.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.698
Make it double.

07:30.076 --> 07:31.327
That's your fucking card.

07:32.870 --> 07:33.746
Pay up.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.332
What's your name, inmate?

07:39.001 --> 07:40.461
Sergeant asked you a question.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.380
Pete Murphy.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.966
OK, hold still.

07:45.675 --> 07:47.969
Hey. Well, what's... what's going on?

07:48.219 --> 07:49.095
Nothing.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.471
We're done.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.890
- I told you.
- And this guy in the photo?

07:53.182 --> 07:55.768
Marius Josipovic.
Got his release a couple weeks ago.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.813
Here's the file copy,
dated three years ago.

07:58.938 --> 08:00.773
Somebody switched up the photos.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.316
Also changed the release date.

08:02.942 --> 08:04.318
Pushed it up nearly two years.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.029
We got a situation.

08:08.239 --> 08:09.615
What're you gonna tell his lawyer?

08:12.284 --> 08:16.288
Ma'am, we're gonna have to look into this.
It's gonna take a little time.

08:17.248 --> 08:18.624
Well, what is there to look into?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.501
His release date is right here
in black and white.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.045
Well, to be honest, there's some confusion
about that release date.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.213
What kind of confusion?

08:24.296 --> 08:25.423
I can't talk to you about that.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.466
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

08:31.095 --> 08:32.972
Are you familiar with Section 983?

08:33.305 --> 08:35.224
You talking about Section 1983?

08:35.307 --> 08:39.770
Don't patronise me, Mr Harding.
US Code 42, Section 1983.

08:39.812 --> 08:40.688
Yes, ma'am.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.650
We can sue you, and the warden,
and other officers in this prison

08:44.734 --> 08:48.487
as individuals for the violation
of Peter Murphy's constitutional rights.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.322
Well, I hope that won't be necessary.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.366
Oh, for God's sake...

08:53.701 --> 08:56.328
First call I make when I walk out of here
will be to Bob Schreier.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.705
- Who?
- Your supervisor

08:57.747 --> 08:59.749
at the Department of Corrections
District Office.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.250
You mean Carol Jenson?

09:02.084 --> 09:04.420
Excuse me. Schreier must be another case.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.552
Where'd you get this?

09:11.761 --> 09:14.096
You left it at the farmhouse that night.
Look on the back.

09:16.474 --> 09:17.641
Marius Josipovic.

09:17.892 --> 09:20.061
That's who Winslow wanted to talk
to Cousin Pete about.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.604
What's your point, Nancy Drew?

09:21.687 --> 09:23.314
He was looking for this Marius guy.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.400
Maybe he found him.

09:26.484 --> 09:28.152
- Maybe that's why he's dead.
- So...

09:28.736 --> 09:32.573
you think that this Marius Josipovic
killed Winslow?

09:33.657 --> 09:35.618
It's possible, isn't it?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.161
Listen, Carly.

09:38.621 --> 09:41.290
Look, I know it's fun to play detective...

09:41.332 --> 09:42.917
Fuck you, Taylor. Maybe I'm right.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.126
- You're not.
- How do you know?

09:44.168 --> 09:45.127
I just know.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.131
What?

09:53.177 --> 09:54.303
You were really...

09:55.429 --> 09:57.807
pissed off when you went
looking for Winslow that night.

09:58.057 --> 09:59.308
Wait...

09:59.767 --> 10:01.894
so now, now you think that...

10:01.977 --> 10:03.479
that I killed Winslow?

10:03.854 --> 10:04.730
Really?

10:05.231 --> 10:07.316
- Did you?
- Jesus, Carly!

10:07.775 --> 10:09.693
Of course not! I don't even understand

10:09.735 --> 10:11.529
- how you think that?
- I dunno, everybody in this family

10:11.612 --> 10:13.322
- is always keeping secrets.
- Carly.

10:14.490 --> 10:15.407
I didn't do it.

10:18.119 --> 10:20.204
Then I don't get
why you're not interested in who did.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.373
I am. I am interested in who did it.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.959
And I will give this to the detective
in charge of the investigation

10:25.042 --> 10:27.253
but listen to me, Carly, Winslow is dead

10:28.379 --> 10:31.048
because he was in business
with some very dangerous people

10:31.549 --> 10:33.509
OK? And they're still out there.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.636
So listen to me, please.

10:37.012 --> 10:37.972
Let this go.

10:39.265 --> 10:40.141
Hm?

10:43.435 --> 10:44.395
OK.

10:45.521 --> 10:47.606
<i>Carol Jenson, Department of Corrections.</i>

10:47.690 --> 10:49.024
Let's check social media.

10:49.275 --> 10:51.569
There must be a million
Carol Jensons out there.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.488
Yeah, but there's only five that live
in the southern corrections district

10:54.530 --> 10:57.908
and four have profile pictures
that look nothing like Carol Jenson.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.244
OK. So camera-shy Carol might be our girl.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.580
Only public information is "friends".

11:03.205 --> 11:05.249
See if any of her friends
have a public feed.

11:07.877 --> 11:10.379
Wait, wait...
Looks like Carol was tagged in a photo

11:10.462 --> 11:13.299
posted by Susie Castro on Instagram.
Do you see that?

11:13.674 --> 11:17.011
"Another amazing dinner with @carolj74."

11:17.386 --> 11:18.262
I got her.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.806
Let's see what Carol's all about.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.226
<i>One fine dining experience after another.</i>

11:24.643 --> 11:26.812
Looks like Carol's a serious foodie.

11:31.442 --> 11:32.776
Sit anywhere you like.

11:40.618 --> 11:41.619
Sammy.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.246
Otto. What're you doing here?

11:45.206 --> 11:48.792
I saw you through the window.
I just wanted to say thanks for yesterday.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.630
All I did was drink your beer
and give you shit.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.256
- Sometimes that's enough.
- Hm!

11:56.175 --> 11:57.509
You want breakfast, or what...?

11:58.344 --> 12:00.930
Yeah, maybe. Maybe, uh...
maybe some coffee.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.766
No. Actually, no.
I've been looking for you.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.060
What'd I do? I mean, what...

12:06.518 --> 12:08.604
- What's wrong?
- I got car trouble.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.564
What kinda car trouble?

12:12.524 --> 12:14.193
That house painter we talked about?

12:15.152 --> 12:18.280
It's his car.
He left it parked near Irish Moe's

12:18.322 --> 12:20.199
and Moe's afraid it's
gonna come back on him.

12:25.871 --> 12:26.997
ANB Bail Bonds.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.499
<i>Sean, it's Sam.</i>

12:28.874 --> 12:31.293
I got a car issue this morning,
probably be a little late.

12:36.298 --> 12:39.093
Eh, it's pretty quiet right now,
just don't make it too long, OK?

12:39.635 --> 12:40.678
Thanks, boss.

12:41.971 --> 12:43.639
Hey, hey, man!

12:44.390 --> 12:47.351
The pink Corvette on the billboard,
that really yours?

12:48.644 --> 12:49.603
It's a company car.

12:49.687 --> 12:52.147
Cos I saw it the other night
parked off the, uh...

12:52.564 --> 12:53.899
Black Rock Turnpike.

12:54.275 --> 12:55.317
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

12:55.401 --> 12:58.862
Hey, so look, who's the model, man?
Cos she's hot.

13:00.030 --> 13:00.948
It's my wife.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.076
Oh, so the blue one must be yours, then?
Right?

13:09.039 --> 13:10.207
What blue one?

13:32.396 --> 13:33.397
Hello?

13:34.732 --> 13:35.816
Detective?

14:00.132 --> 14:01.008
Fuck!

14:07.348 --> 14:08.223
Hey, Grandma.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.850
- Did you find it?
<i>- Uh, no.</i>

14:09.892 --> 14:11.560
I wasn't able
to get into the evidence room yet.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.062
Well, how hard can it be?

14:13.270 --> 14:15.898
- I'm doing my best, OK?
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

14:15.939 --> 14:18.275
- I'm just so shaky and... and...
<i>- No, I understand.</i>

14:18.442 --> 14:21.278
- Look, I gotta go.
- But there's something I forgot to tell you.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.905
- What?
<i>- There were two crashes that night.</i>

14:22.946 --> 14:25.699
- I'm not sure the police know about the first.
- Grandma, we can talk about this later

14:25.741 --> 14:27.242
- OK? Love you.
<i>- But what if that's where</i>

14:27.284 --> 14:28.327
I lost the headlight?

14:29.119 --> 14:31.330
Taylor? Taylor?

14:35.292 --> 14:36.752
<i>Hi, you've reached Taylor's pho--</i>

14:36.794 --> 14:37.669
No...

14:43.926 --> 14:44.885
Administration.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.054
- Carol Jenson?
<i>- Speaking.</i>

14:47.763 --> 14:50.057
?
This is Carol Jenson @carolj74

14:50.099 --> 14:52.893
That is my Instagram handle, yes.

14:53.102 --> 14:54.561
Hi. This is Duncan Walker.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.231
I'm the outreach manager for Café Blond.
How are you today?

14:57.356 --> 14:59.400
Uh... um, I'm fine.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.360
What can I do for you, Mr Walker?

15:01.860 --> 15:02.986
Uh, yeah, call me Duncan.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.240
I, uh... listen, I'm not sure
if you're familiar with our establishment

15:06.323 --> 15:08.325
- or not but--
<i>- No, of course I am familiar</i>

15:08.409 --> 15:09.410
<i>with Café Blond.</i>

15:09.868 --> 15:11.328
Oh, have you dined with us before?

15:11.453 --> 15:16.083
No. I've tried several times,
but it is very hard to get a reservation.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.002
Ah, yeah. Victims of our own success.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.464
Uh, that's why we're reaching out
to up-and-coming "online influencers"

15:22.506 --> 15:23.507
like yourself, Carol.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.342
<i>Uh, "influencer?"</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:27.094
That is hardly me.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.929
Well, permit me to disagree.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.140
I read dozens of food blogs

15:31.223 --> 15:32.433
Instagram feeds, Twitter feeds

15:32.516 --> 15:35.185
and Carol, I honestly can't believe
you're not a professional food critic.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.605
Well, um, you are too, too kind...

15:39.148 --> 15:43.986
Which is why we would like you to be
our guest today, for lunch, at Café Blond.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.905
<i>Wait, is this a... is this a prank?</i>

15:47.197 --> 15:48.949
I was never more serious in my life.

15:50.117 --> 15:53.078
We just want you telling your Instagram
followers what you think of us.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.163
Please say yes.

15:55.164 --> 15:58.125
Um... yes?

16:13.223 --> 16:14.099
Let's go...

16:14.766 --> 16:17.019
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get away from the SUV.

16:23.609 --> 16:28.572
Hi, I'm Julia, from Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
I'd like to talk to Luis.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.783
We've bailed out a lot of his people
over the years.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.869
Also his sister. His little brother.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.662
His mum. He knows me.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.044
Tell him it's "Little Blondie."

16:58.602 --> 16:59.603
Excuse me.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.813
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.399
I'm sorry,
I have an appointment with Duncan?

17:04.775 --> 17:05.651
Uh...

17:05.692 --> 17:07.444
- Carol?
- Duncan?

17:07.694 --> 17:08.904
- Right this way, please.
- Oh, hi.

17:08.946 --> 17:11.406
- I hope you found us OK?
- Absolutely.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.575
We have a lovely table for you
right by the window.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.410
Oh, my goodness! That's beautiful.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.621
- Do you want me to take your purse?
- Thank you.

17:18.038 --> 17:18.914
Here we go.

17:20.874 --> 17:21.833
Emilio.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.294
This is Emilio, he'll be your server today.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.671
- Sir?
- This is Carol Jenson.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.423
Oh, Ms Jenson,
I've heard so much about you.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.592
Listen, we just found out she's pregnant

17:30.634 --> 17:32.886
and her co-workers
are trying to throw her a surprise shower

17:32.928 --> 17:34.763
so they need to get her out of the office.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.641
She's always wanted to eat here.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.144
It's lovely to finally meet you

17:41.186 --> 17:43.522
I'm gonna leave you in Emilio's
very capable hands.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.400
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>
- Oh, <i>oui.</i>

17:51.905 --> 17:54.324
I never heard back from Otto.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.996
Well, I actually didn't tell him
that you called yet.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.372
But I will.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.665
I promise.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.627
I ask for Otto, you don't tell Otto...

18:06.837 --> 18:09.590
but you drive all the way out here
to tell me you didn't tell him?

18:10.882 --> 18:11.758
Right.

18:12.718 --> 18:13.760
You got my attention.

18:14.595 --> 18:18.307
Well, I actually was remembering
how you used to come into the bail office

18:18.599 --> 18:19.975
I think I was about ten...?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.769
Skinny little thing, hiding in the back

18:22.894 --> 18:23.937
with her school work.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.397
You used to scare me.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.233
Used to? Hey, I scare myself sometimes.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.820
Point is, we got history, right?

18:33.363 --> 18:34.823
So how about you state your business?

18:35.032 --> 18:36.491
You used to own a coin laundry.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.494
- I own seven now.
- Oh, well, congratulations.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.538
Yeah, everybody's got dirty laundry,
you know?

18:41.705 --> 18:43.790
Yeah, that's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.960
See, I have, um... some valuable, uh...

18:47.502 --> 18:50.130
let's say... linens

18:50.547 --> 18:53.467
and I am really not sure...

18:53.842 --> 18:56.386
how to... launder them.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.640
Mm-hmm.
Are we talking presidential-type linen?

18:59.931 --> 19:01.600
Hundred-fifty thousand.

19:01.933 --> 19:06.188
Ooh, commission on that'd be 20%,
but on account of our history

19:06.813 --> 19:09.441
I'll just do it,
friend of the family discount, huh?

19:09.524 --> 19:13.070
Oh, my God, Mr Mercado,
that would be amazing.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.905
Ah, we're doing business.
Call me Luis.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.074
Thank you, uh... Luis.

19:18.617 --> 19:20.452
And I'll tell you what you can do for me.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.788
Don't worry, it's not illegal.

19:24.289 --> 19:28.168
Friend of mine, name of Valerie Abeyta,
got arrested.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.796
Hey, you bond out Valerie?

19:31.713 --> 19:32.923
I'll take care of your linen.

19:34.091 --> 19:37.135
Is Ms Abeyta by any chance
considered a flight risk?

19:37.386 --> 19:40.097
She's got US and Mexican passports.
That a flight risk?

19:41.056 --> 19:43.934
- Well...
- Guess that's why the bail is high.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.645
But like I said, Valerie's a friend.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.856
Hate to see her locked up in a cage.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.276
Let me guess,
you've tried other bail bond companies?

19:53.402 --> 19:54.319
A few.

19:56.279 --> 20:01.201
I really, really appreciate
this opportunity, Luis.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.038
Could I have 24 hours
just to think it over?

20:05.414 --> 20:07.040
Well, Valerie ain't going anywhere.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.794
But just so we clear, no bail, no laundry.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.816
Hey, babe. Lunch?

20:33.275 --> 20:34.317
Great idea.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.902
Hey, let's take my car.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.988
Uh, OK. Sure.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.116
Sounds like you've been having
some trouble with the Pink Lady.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.284
What do you mean?

20:42.576 --> 20:45.620
Somebody saw her parked
off of Black Rock Turnpike the other night.

20:47.581 --> 20:48.582
I don't think so.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.125
Last Thursday?

20:51.418 --> 20:54.504
When I was in Hartford,
otherwise you would've called?

20:54.588 --> 20:58.341
Oh, yeah.
There's a reason I didn't mention that.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.927
- I got pulled over. Traffic stop.
- Really?

21:01.553 --> 21:02.554
Yeah, by guess who?

21:03.805 --> 21:04.806
You tell me.

21:05.515 --> 21:06.808
Who do you think would pull me over

21:06.850 --> 21:09.186
for a broken tail light
when I didn't even have one?

21:10.479 --> 21:13.648
Taylor. In his dad's old Plymouth Fury,
like he's still in high school

21:13.732 --> 21:15.650
which in a way, he still is.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.278
Why didn't you say anything
about it before?

21:18.361 --> 21:20.363
I didn't want to give him the satisfaction.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.783
And you have enough on your plate.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.577
Babe, you don't need to protect me.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.538
It's the Bernhardts
who're gonna need protecting.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.968
The artichoke salad with mint aioli...

21:42.052 --> 21:43.887
- That's the best salad on the menu.
- Oh, good.

21:43.929 --> 21:47.682
And the... brown butter hazelnut torte.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.101
That's amazing too.
You won't be disappointed.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.019
Can't wait.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.522
Oh, could you hand me my, uh, purse?

21:53.605 --> 21:54.981
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.024
You're welcome.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.184
Artichoke salad with mint aioli.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.687
Oh, I have to post this!

22:37.899 --> 22:39.943
This is Duane. How are you, Ms Jenson?

22:39.985 --> 22:41.820
Duane, it's Scott Emerson,
from the governor's office.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.446
- Sorry, who?
<i>- Scott Emerson.</i>

22:43.488 --> 22:46.157
Uh, Carol asked me to call you,
but we've met before.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.242
- We have?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

22:47.284 --> 22:49.536
<i>The day you got your picture taken
with the governor?</i>

22:50.328 --> 22:54.875
Oh, yes, of course.
Tall, sandy-haired fellow?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.376
Yeah. That's me.

22:56.793 --> 23:00.797
Uh, look, you had a visit today
from a lawyer named Sarah Pitman?

23:01.798 --> 23:03.925
- Real pain in the ass.
<i>- Yeah, oh, yeah.</i>

23:03.967 --> 23:06.136
<i>We call her "Pitman the Pitbull."</i>

23:06.177 --> 23:09.139
- That's the one.
- Well, after she left you, she called Carol

23:09.180 --> 23:12.642
<i>and then Carol called me at the Field
Office and we started getting into this.</i>

23:12.934 --> 23:14.352
- Sorry about all the fuss.
<i>- No, no.</i>

23:14.394 --> 23:16.897
It turns out this lawyer
might've done us all a big favour.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.648
That's why Carol wanted me to loop you in.

23:18.732 --> 23:21.318
She's busy working
with the cyber security guys right now

23:21.359 --> 23:23.153
otherwise she would've called you herself.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.195
<i>Cyber security?</i>

23:24.321 --> 23:26.156
Uh, they're trying to figure out

23:26.239 --> 23:29.951
how Marius Josipovic's picture
got into Pete Murphy's file.

23:30.619 --> 23:31.494
Got any idea?

23:31.912 --> 23:35.206
Yeah, they do, but uh...
it's not good news.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.220
Ma'am, is something wrong?

23:49.304 --> 23:53.224
Uh, my... my ID badge.
I'm almost certain I...

23:54.184 --> 23:58.939
Um... I'm so sorry, Emilio.
I... I will be back.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.738
It's hackers, Duane.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.198
<i>You serious?</i>

24:08.406 --> 24:09.491
As a heart attack.

24:11.993 --> 24:12.911
<i>Well, how bad?</i>

24:13.870 --> 24:17.832
Uh, well, that's what Carol's
working with our IT guys to figure out.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.876
You know, it could be a little
one-time intrusion

24:19.918 --> 24:23.213
but since our system's based on
a two-factor identification

24:23.254 --> 24:24.214
it could be bigger.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.215
A lot bigger.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.761
Or it could turn out to be no big deal.
You know what I'm saying, Duane?

24:30.679 --> 24:33.264
- You're saying we don't want to overreact.
- Exactly.

24:33.348 --> 24:36.184
We just don't want the warden or,
God forbid, the governor involved

24:36.267 --> 24:38.144
unless it's absolutely necessary, do we?

24:38.269 --> 24:39.813
Is there anything that I can do?

24:39.938 --> 24:41.648
This lawyer, Pitman the Pitbull.

24:41.940 --> 24:45.402
We don't want her going to court or even
worse, calling the media about this.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.279
You need to neutralise her, Duane.

24:49.698 --> 24:50.615
How?

24:50.699 --> 24:52.575
Give her Pete Murphy.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.996
Walt? Walt, I must've left
my ID badge upstairs.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.831
Do you mind?
I'll bring it right back down.

24:58.707 --> 24:59.624
Thank you.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.086
Don't I need some kind of authorisation?

25:03.294 --> 25:05.255
Authorisation?
Duane, you told me yourself

25:05.296 --> 25:07.257
the file says he's overdue for release.

25:09.300 --> 25:12.345
But the date on the hard copy...

25:12.387 --> 25:13.722
<i>Look, if Pitman files a lawsuit</i>

25:13.763 --> 25:15.348
it's gonna blow this whole thing wide open.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.809
The media's gonna call it
a major breach in security

25:18.059 --> 25:20.395
and give the department
and the governor a black eye.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.606
- Is that what you want?
<i>- N... n... heck, no.</i>

25:23.815 --> 25:25.608
No, and then she's gonna
come after you, Duane.

25:25.650 --> 25:28.278
You really wanna spend the first
three years of your retirement

25:28.319 --> 25:29.988
giving depositions and going to court?

25:30.363 --> 25:33.700
Having prisoners' rights protesters
marching outside your house?

25:33.742 --> 25:35.201
No, you don't wanna do that, do you?

25:35.452 --> 25:37.162
- Absolutely not.
<i>- Plus we're not talking about</i>

25:37.203 --> 25:40.498
a murderer here.
Pete Murphy isn't a public menace.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.250
<i>That's true, no, he's not.</i>

25:42.417 --> 25:44.753
No, he's an idiot
who tried to rob a gun range.

25:45.295 --> 25:46.463
Sure, but, uh...

25:46.546 --> 25:48.882
You know what, Duane?
Let's switch gears here.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.051
Uh, I'm gonna call the commissioner.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.343
What's your fax number?

26:40.975 --> 26:44.854
OK, I put the licence plate
into the DMV system, got the VIN number

26:44.938 --> 26:49.025
and now I'm using this, frankly illegal,
application

26:49.359 --> 26:51.236
to talk to the car's security system

26:51.611 --> 26:54.197
and reprogramme the doors
and ignition codes.

26:54.531 --> 26:58.326
Jesus, it used to be all you needed was
a Slim-Jim and a pair of wire strippers.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.788
- A lot harder to steal a car these days.
- We're not stealing the car.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.374
- What would you call it?
- We're doing Irish Moe a solid.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.292
I'll remember to tell the judge.

27:06.835 --> 27:07.752
OK, there you go.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.129
There you go.

27:09.170 --> 27:13.258
A $4,000 security system
defeated by a $60 app.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.968
- Great.
- I'll unlock it when you're ready.

27:15.009 --> 27:15.927
Then I'm gone.

27:17.971 --> 27:18.847
Any time.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.275
Shit.

27:34.445 --> 27:35.446
Detective Roby?

27:36.030 --> 27:36.906
That's right.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.701
I'm Officer Bowman. Taylor.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.372
I'm the guy who talked
to Detective Winslow when he was here.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.499
You wanted to interview me.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.126
I do, but not right now.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.546
Oh, no. I didn't... I didn't mean right now.
I just... I was just...

27:52.213 --> 27:53.214
introducing myself.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.800
I'll have Detective Lockley come find you
when I'm ready.

27:56.759 --> 27:57.635
Alright.

27:57.927 --> 28:00.221
Door, um... open or closed?

28:00.805 --> 28:01.681
Closed.

28:10.398 --> 28:11.691
How do you mean that, exactly?

28:11.816 --> 28:14.235
Says it right here,
his release date was 11 days ago.

28:14.652 --> 28:15.653
We're out of compliance.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.948
But the file copy says
he's got two years left on his bit.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.408
Would you forget the damn file copy?

28:20.742 --> 28:24.621
I have personal authorisation
from the commissioner's office, right here.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.123
Am I gonna get a release order?

28:27.874 --> 28:29.125
What the hell's the matter with you?

28:29.459 --> 28:31.628
If the commissioner's office
says to kick him, we kick him.

28:31.669 --> 28:32.545
Is that clear?

28:44.307 --> 28:45.767
- Hey.
- Sean knows.

28:45.808 --> 28:46.684
What?

28:46.726 --> 28:50.230
Somebody saw our cars parked in that
turnout the other night, and told Sean.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.482
Wait, did he say something to you?

28:52.941 --> 28:56.402
He asked if I'd had car trouble,
but he was just testing me.

28:56.778 --> 28:57.862
And what'd you say?

28:58.404 --> 29:00.865
I told him that you'd pulled me over,
you know

29:00.949 --> 29:03.534
a traffic stop, to hassle me again.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.161
That's perfect. That's perfect.

29:05.203 --> 29:06.663
But what if he didn't believe it?

29:06.955 --> 29:09.707
Look, Shannon, he hates my guts, OK?

29:10.166 --> 29:12.043
<i>Your story just confirms
what an asshole I am.</i>

29:12.085 --> 29:13.962
It's the best answer you could've given.

29:14.212 --> 29:15.505
Taylor, I love you--

29:15.546 --> 29:17.090
Hey, Detective, you ready?

29:17.924 --> 29:20.510
I'm gonna go take a look at Winslow's car,
then we'll talk.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.552
I'll be here.

29:36.609 --> 29:37.485
Shit.

29:55.044 --> 29:57.922
I had just started the second shift,
covering the front desk

29:57.964 --> 30:00.508
and I hear this voice
say, "Is anybody here?"

30:00.717 --> 30:01.718
Or something like that.

30:02.135 --> 30:04.595
And I could tell by his tone and his, uh...

30:05.138 --> 30:06.806
demeanour that he was annoyed

30:07.682 --> 30:09.017
Did he say something specific?

30:09.434 --> 30:13.021
No, he just had that big-city
homicide detective vibe.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.190
What "vibe" is that?

30:16.816 --> 30:17.692
You know...

30:18.067 --> 30:19.444
uh, just, uh...

30:20.361 --> 30:23.323
a little impatient
with the slower pace of life here.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.783
Present company excepted.

30:28.619 --> 30:29.620
What happened then?

30:30.580 --> 30:33.624
Well, he said he was looking for somebody
that he thought was in the Bridgeport area

30:33.666 --> 30:36.836
but he appeared to be holding a photograph
of the individual.

30:36.961 --> 30:39.672
- Man or woman?
- I just saw the back of the photo.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.675
And then his cell phone rang
and he said he'd be right back.

30:42.717 --> 30:43.634
Walked out the door.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.386
End of story.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.473
And you never saw him again?

30:50.391 --> 30:52.268
No, ma'am, never saw him again.

30:53.728 --> 30:54.687
He show you his badge?

30:54.854 --> 30:56.522
Mm-hmm. That's how I knew he was NYPD.

30:58.149 --> 30:59.484
But he never told you his name?

30:59.984 --> 31:01.277
Mm, no, but, uh...

31:02.653 --> 31:03.863
You don't forget that eye.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.589
- Far enough?
- Yeah.

31:23.758 --> 31:24.926
It's a nice car.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.095
Who said it wasn't?

31:28.471 --> 31:29.514
I'm just sayin'.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.020
Well, it's gotta disappear.

31:36.813 --> 31:38.815
The only way it doesn't come back
on our friend.

32:04.382 --> 32:06.551
Thanks, Sammy. I owe you.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.054
D'you ever think maybe it'd be easier

32:10.096 --> 32:12.223
if you'd just left me there in the jungle,
that day?

32:14.767 --> 32:15.643
I know I do.

32:19.689 --> 32:21.399
Alright, where am I gonna drop you?

32:26.612 --> 32:27.989
- Murphy.
- Yes, sir?

32:28.114 --> 32:29.031
Come with me.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.825
W... What'd I do?

32:31.784 --> 32:33.035
You got lucky.

32:33.870 --> 32:35.746
Yeah, I'll see you on the street, bitch.

32:37.165 --> 32:39.459
Yeah, I'm still gonna get you, asshole!

32:39.917 --> 32:41.752
Alright, alright, come on, move!

32:56.601 --> 32:58.352
Marius, you got a text.

33:01.314 --> 33:02.231
Well?

33:03.858 --> 33:04.817
We did it.

33:05.735 --> 33:06.694
They got him out.

33:17.538 --> 33:20.583
No... no, ma'am, no, that's Animal Control.

33:21.918 --> 33:25.922
I'll, uh, I'll transfer you to City Services
and they can connect you, OK?

33:25.963 --> 33:28.090
Just stay on the line. Stay on the line.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.219
OK, I gotta get back to the city
for this thing.

33:31.427 --> 33:33.179
You mind logging these back
into Evidence for me?

33:34.096 --> 33:35.640
- Not a problem.
- Thanks.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.313
Look, I get it.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.607
I come in here

33:44.774 --> 33:47.235
second-guessing your work,
looking over everybody's shoulder--

33:47.276 --> 33:49.070
No, I understand, you know.

33:49.237 --> 33:50.404
Winslow was one of your own.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.281
Of course you wanna make sure
we get it right.

33:52.615 --> 33:54.742
If the shoe was on the other foot,
I'd do the same.

33:55.660 --> 33:59.288
Besides, it's not my work
that you're second-guessing.

33:59.372 --> 34:00.456
It's the detectives'.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.208
I'll be back tomorrow.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.651
Shit... sorry, Grandma.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.227
<i>You were about to fucking kill me!</i>

35:03.561 --> 35:04.478
<i>Pete!</i>

35:11.777 --> 35:12.695
<i>Audrey!</i>

35:24.582 --> 35:26.375
Oh, my God!

35:26.500 --> 35:28.085
God, you scared me half to death.

35:29.587 --> 35:31.130
Looks like you lost something.

35:32.173 --> 35:35.676
Yeah, an earring.
I lost it the other day, hiking.

35:35.885 --> 35:38.888
I was hoping maybe I'd find it again,
but it's like...

35:39.555 --> 35:41.682
it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

35:42.642 --> 35:46.062
You missed the "No Trespassing" sign,
back along the way?

35:48.397 --> 35:50.608
Oh, sorry, is this your property?

35:51.567 --> 35:52.818
Third generation.

35:57.740 --> 35:58.824
It's a beautiful place.

36:00.743 --> 36:01.702
Very peaceful.

36:02.787 --> 36:05.665
Fella got shot dead in his car
the other night.

36:05.873 --> 36:06.957
Oh, my!

36:07.124 --> 36:08.167
Down that way.

36:08.668 --> 36:10.336
Blew his brains clean out.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.964
Police been talking to
everybody, hereabouts.

36:16.092 --> 36:19.136
I really have to go.
I'm sorry if I inconvenienced you.

36:19.845 --> 36:20.721
Take care.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.938
- You got a brown streak on your nose.
- What?

36:28.979 --> 36:30.481
Wha... What're you talking about?

36:30.564 --> 36:33.109
It must be from that ass-kissing
you laid on our friend from the NYPD.

36:33.567 --> 36:37.196
I didn't kiss any ass, I just kept the
static to a minimum, like you said.

36:37.279 --> 36:40.282
Well, you must've did something right,
because she requested you to be her liaison.

36:40.783 --> 36:43.077
What? No. I'm not gonna...
No, I'm not gonna do that. No way.

36:43.119 --> 36:44.537
What makes you think you got a choice?

36:45.121 --> 36:47.164
Plus, it gets you off the desk
for a couple days.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.041
You want me to do it?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.419
I want you to do whatever's
gonna get her gone, quickly.

37:08.436 --> 37:09.437
How you doing, kid?

37:10.980 --> 37:14.108
Fine, Sam, thanks.
Uh, Sean wants to see you in his office.

37:22.616 --> 37:23.492
You wanted me?

37:24.702 --> 37:26.579
Yeah, come in, come in, shut the door.

37:29.123 --> 37:30.124
What's up?

37:31.834 --> 37:33.502
You get that car trouble taken care of?

37:33.919 --> 37:35.129
Yeah, it's all good, thanks.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.298
Yeah, you're a valued employee, Sam.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.717
I don't mind giving you flex time.

37:40.801 --> 37:41.761
I trust you.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.180
Oh, good to hear.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.724
Good to hear. Uh... is that it?

37:47.141 --> 37:48.851
I need you to run a surveillance for me.

37:49.935 --> 37:50.811
OK.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.229
It'll be off the books.

37:53.689 --> 37:54.982
I'll pay you myself.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.526
I don't want anyone else to know about it.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.988
Uh, who's the target?

38:03.949 --> 38:04.909
My wife.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.045
I'm here to pick up Pete Murphy.
I was told he's being released.

38:18.005 --> 38:18.964
Not on the list.

38:21.050 --> 38:25.429
I was assured that he would be here
by Deputy Superintendent Harding.

38:30.226 --> 38:32.520
Mr Harding. This is Officer Kane, security.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.689
I've got a lawyer here, says you told her
Pete Murphy was getting out.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.027
I told you to get
Pete Murphy out of here.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.070
And I handled it.

38:41.111 --> 38:44.156
Well, his lawyer's waiting for him
down at Security, and he ain't there.

38:44.615 --> 38:46.617
Well, I couldn't just walk him out
the front door

38:46.659 --> 38:49.328
without that coming back on me,
now could I? Mm-mm.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.705
- But he's gone.
- How?

38:53.040 --> 38:54.542
I talked to a CO I know.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.002
Told him you'd recommend a bump
in his pay grade

38:57.086 --> 38:59.046
if he helped us, so he did.

39:11.100 --> 39:11.976
What?

39:12.601 --> 39:14.770
The good news is, he's out.

39:15.604 --> 39:16.522
So where is he?

39:18.524 --> 39:19.775
That's the bad news.

39:43.132 --> 39:44.008
Hey!

39:45.759 --> 39:49.179
No, wait! Hey, wait for me!

39:50.139 --> 39:51.348
Stop the bus!

39:52.683 --> 39:53.726
Hey!

39:56.687 --> 39:58.147
