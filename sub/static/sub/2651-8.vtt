WEBVTT

00:03.495 --> 00:05.647
And we have liftoff.

00:07.576 --> 00:10.296
Yello?
House of the future.

00:10.415 --> 00:12.088
Phil, you have
two whole days to yourself.

00:12.175 --> 00:15.168
Please tell me you're not gonna spend them
trying to wire the house to your iPad.

00:15.296 --> 00:16.491
Nope, 'cause
I've already done it.

00:16.576 --> 00:17.850
...showers and thunderstorms-

00:17.936 --> 00:20.165
I think when you get home, you're
gonna be very surprised...

00:20.255 --> 00:23.247
to see that this house has an
actual functioning brain in it.

00:23.374 --> 00:26.368
Great. Great. Now
go out and see some friends.

00:26.455 --> 00:29.288
I'm headed out now. I have a
third showing at that colonial.

00:29.374 --> 00:31.570
Cam gave me
a free pass to his gym.

00:31.654 --> 00:33.692
- I am-Not too bright.
- Mmm.

00:33.775 --> 00:35.732
I am-Dim!

00:35.854 --> 00:37.448
Honey, if you could
hear yourself.

00:37.534 --> 00:39.128
Promise me you'll
go outside and play.

00:39.214 --> 00:40.729
Miss you too.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.415
Phil Dunphy,
this is the year 2025.

00:46.534 --> 00:49.174
Welcome.
You're the first one here.

00:50.614 --> 00:51.430
♪ Hey, hey ♪

00:52.135 --> 00:55.208
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

00:58.734 --> 00:59.884
♪ Hey♪ ♪

01:02.293 --> 01:03.523
Shall we hit
the waterslide first?

01:03.613 --> 01:05.251
I may just sit
in the room for a bit.

01:05.334 --> 01:08.929
Ugh! Stop moping! So you didn't
get a date to one stupid dance.

01:09.054 --> 01:11.614
It's not one stupid dance. It's the
kickoff to the whole dance season.

01:11.694 --> 01:14.209
It's like you've never
heard boys talk.

01:14.293 --> 01:18.368
Hi. We are here for the academic challenge.
It's under "Dunphy."

01:18.453 --> 01:21.094
Or it could be under
"returning champion."

01:21.173 --> 01:23.564
Not sure how
they file these things.

01:23.694 --> 01:25.606
Alex wins things,
which is great.

01:25.694 --> 01:29.004
But she puts so much
pressure on herself. I-

01:29.094 --> 01:31.893
I almost wish
she would lose this year.

01:31.974 --> 01:33.566
Plus, that way, I could
go on the waterslide.

01:33.654 --> 01:36.042
It's got a corkscrew,
two-second free fall...

01:36.133 --> 01:39.045
and a radar gun at the bottom.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.726
I'm Phil.

01:40.813 --> 01:42.964
Nothing from the minibar
and no pay-per-view.

01:43.093 --> 01:46.051
Can we at least-No, you may not
send things out for pressing.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.845
Honey, we have an hour
until the competition.

01:47.932 --> 01:49.526
Do you want to go
to the contestants mixer?

01:49.612 --> 01:51.366
No, I don't want
to humanize them.

01:51.452 --> 01:53.684
Can you believe this
is my first bar mitzvah?

01:53.773 --> 01:56.242
You'll love it. I heard
the gift bags have smartphones.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.450
Jewish people are so awesome.

01:59.533 --> 02:02.890
Oh, my God. Did you see that?
She smiled at me.

02:02.973 --> 02:04.532
People get that way
in dance season.

02:04.652 --> 02:06.530
No girl's ever
smiled at me like that.

02:06.652 --> 02:08.485
Luke, we have to go
to that bar mitzvah.

02:08.652 --> 02:11.008
Why?
There was a connection.

02:11.093 --> 02:14.641
I know this sounds crazy, but I feel like
my whole life has led to this moment.

02:14.731 --> 02:17.803
You made a very similar speech to get
my mom to stop for those churros.

02:17.891 --> 02:20.122
Luke, I need you for this.
You're sneakier than I am.

02:20.211 --> 02:22.966
You're a bigger liar.
You have no moral compass.

02:23.052 --> 02:25.931
Look, thanks for all the compliments.
But break into one stupid party?

02:26.011 --> 02:29.004
That's not even a challenge.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.683
Oh, no.
Three bar mitzvahs?

02:33.891 --> 02:36.725
Now it's interesting.

02:38.851 --> 02:40.127
Cam, stop.

02:40.211 --> 02:43.761
What? We have to get them out of there.
What's taking them?

02:43.851 --> 02:46.765
We have the most amazing gift
for Jay and Gloria's nursery.

02:46.851 --> 02:49.968
It was Cam's idea,
and it's a pretty big swing.

02:50.051 --> 02:51.689
It's not a swing.
It's not a swing.

02:51.770 --> 02:54.411
I just need Jay and Gloria out of the
house for a minimum of four hours...

02:54.531 --> 02:56.044
so I can have
my crew install it.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.685
Simple.
Oh, please.

02:57.770 --> 03:00.205
If it were up to you, we'd get them
something off their gift registry.

03:00.330 --> 03:03.129
Oh, you mean the list of things that
they specifically said that they wanted?

03:03.251 --> 03:05.128
Oh, they don't know
what they want.

03:05.290 --> 03:07.725
...before I snap his finger off!

03:09.251 --> 03:13.039
Ay, no. Jay was supposed to cancel.
We cannot go to lunch.

03:13.131 --> 03:14.645
Oh, no.
I am sorry,

03:14.730 --> 03:18.008
but he's supposed to pick up the crib
at the store, and I am too tired.

03:18.091 --> 03:20.207
The baby kick me all night.

03:20.290 --> 03:23.681
It's either going to be a
football player or a chorus girl.

03:23.811 --> 03:25.324
You can be both.
My senior year,

03:25.411 --> 03:28.323
I was a right-side linebacker and a
left-side cancan dancer in Gigi.

03:28.410 --> 03:30.241
Wow, she really set you up
for that one, didn't she?

03:30.329 --> 03:32.322
Yeah, when it came out of her
mouth, I nearly stopped breathing.

03:32.410 --> 03:34.208
You didn't call them to cancel.

03:34.329 --> 03:38.926
Sorry. You want gas money? Don't pay attention to him.
He's been very grumpy lately.

03:39.009 --> 03:41.843
Okay, here's a thought-Mitchell,
you go to the crib store with Jay.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.444
That way I can spend some quality
time with this pretty lady.

03:44.569 --> 03:47.801
No, I'm going to lay down. No, no,
I'm gonna take you both to lunch.

03:47.889 --> 03:50.358
Okay? There, it's settled.
Now go put a lip on. Okay?

03:50.449 --> 03:51.970
Fine. I guess you won't
get in the way.

03:52.009 --> 03:55.889
You mean it, Pa? Really
and for true? I won't get in the way?

03:56.050 --> 03:58.690
Oh, that's a good idea.

03:58.769 --> 04:00.442
Oh, yeah.
The chairs are rocks.

04:00.530 --> 04:02.680
Charlemagne.

04:02.769 --> 04:06.842
You can get a one-day cushion for
eight dollars or a two-day for $12.

04:06.969 --> 04:10.963
A lex Dunphy. Last year, I
got two one-dayers-big mistake.

04:11.048 --> 04:12.607
Who wrote
The Ninety-Five Theses?

04:12.689 --> 04:15.567
My daughter went on to win the whole
thing, and all I could think was,

04:15.649 --> 04:17.641
"I just flushed four dollars
down the toilet."

04:17.728 --> 04:19.208
John Calvin.

04:19.289 --> 04:20.880
Whoo! Alex!

04:20.968 --> 04:24.929
I guess I just didn't want to presume
that we would be here for the two days.

04:25.008 --> 04:27.763
But still, what kind of message
was I sending with the one-dayer?

04:27.888 --> 04:30.357
You whooed me?
What are you doing here?

04:30.489 --> 04:33.527
I'm out. I got the question wrong, which is
embarrassing enough without you whooing me.

04:33.609 --> 04:37.239
Alex! Alex, come back here.

04:37.328 --> 04:38.888
Don't!

04:40.328 --> 04:43.560
Wait. What are the last four
numbers again? 1-9-8-4.

04:43.647 --> 04:46.368
It's kind of a lucky number for me.
It's the year Footloose came out.

04:46.407 --> 04:48.923
Oh, yeah. And I really am gonna
call you for that rematch.

04:49.007 --> 04:51.567
Anytime. I mean,
not super late, but-

04:51.688 --> 04:53.805
Wait.
You're a Bulldog?

04:53.928 --> 04:57.079
Yeah. You? Um-

04:58.767 --> 05:00.645
I knew there was something
about you I liked.

05:00.728 --> 05:03.368
Oh, you mean besides
me letting you win? Ha.

05:03.447 --> 05:06.007
You know, we have a big game today.
Do you want to watch it together?

05:06.128 --> 05:08.517
Oh. Uh, well-Shoot. I'm-I'm
late for a showing.

05:08.608 --> 05:11.406
No pressure at all, but if you feel
like it, we could watch it at my place.

05:11.527 --> 05:13.962
I could text you the address.
All right. Well, thanks.

05:14.128 --> 05:17.041
It was great meeting you, Phil.
You too, Dave.

05:20.687 --> 05:23.600
Hey, it's me. Yeah, you were
totally right about this gym.

05:23.687 --> 05:25.518
I just met the cutest guy.

05:25.607 --> 05:27.963
What did I tell you? That place
is like a gay bar with dumbbells.

05:28.047 --> 05:29.526
Redundant.

05:29.607 --> 05:31.997
I don't know much about him, but
he invited me over to his place...

05:32.086 --> 05:33.566
to watch a football game
tonight.

05:33.687 --> 05:36.247
Oh, my gosh. A date. I have
a good feeling about this.

05:36.326 --> 05:38.167
Oh, well, don't start
planning the wedding yet.

05:38.206 --> 05:40.562
I mean, I'm not even sure
if it's a date-date.

05:40.646 --> 05:43.002
You met him at hookup central.
Of course it's a date-date.

05:43.086 --> 05:45.555
Am I even ready for a date-date?
Tough love time, David.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.127
Simon left you six months ago,
and you're bumming everyone out.

05:48.206 --> 05:49.845
It's time to get
back up on that horse.

05:49.927 --> 05:52.078
Hope to see you tonight, Dave.

05:52.206 --> 05:55.040
I can't remember the last time
a man made that sound for me.

06:06.405 --> 06:08.476
She's not here.
We have the wrong bar mitzvah.

06:08.565 --> 06:10.000
Not if you like
prime rib, bubbie.

06:10.085 --> 06:11.804
You said to blend.

06:11.885 --> 06:16.005
I picked up some expressions at the latke station.
P.S. They're hash browns.

06:16.085 --> 06:20.126
We're not blending. She's at
one of the other two. Come on.

06:20.246 --> 06:23.762
Oh. Sorry.
Such a hurry, this one.

06:23.846 --> 06:25.325
Come on.

06:27.126 --> 06:30.164
That is too cute.
What the hell is that?

06:30.286 --> 06:32.323
Oh, that's the store mascot.
That's Hug-a-Bunny.

06:32.445 --> 06:34.597
He goes around and he
hugs-No, I get it.

06:34.686 --> 06:38.314
Nice for flu season. He ought to
be called Conjunctivitis Bunny.

06:38.404 --> 06:41.762
Okay. Uh, so, Dad,
the cribs are over there.

06:41.845 --> 06:45.076
But while we're here, a little advice-you
can never have too many Onesies.

06:45.165 --> 06:46.644
All right?
Any event, day or night.

06:46.725 --> 06:49.081
Throw one on, little pair of
booties-boom-ready to go out.

06:49.165 --> 06:53.523
Dress it up. You could dress it down.
You could-Dad?

06:53.605 --> 06:55.197
Dad.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.082
Something was clearly
going on with my dad,

06:57.165 --> 06:58.918
but I wasn't about
to get sucked in.

06:59.004 --> 07:02.680
It's happened before. "Dad, you seem sad.
Do you wanna talk?"

07:02.764 --> 07:05.439
"Talk? What are we,
girlfriends?"

07:05.524 --> 07:11.122
To use a sports reference-Put the
football away, Lucy. I ain't kickin'.

07:11.245 --> 07:13.600
So Saturday noon?
Saturday noon's fine, Jay.

07:13.685 --> 07:15.436
Hey, Dad, I picked you
up a diaper bag.

07:15.523 --> 07:18.402
Fun fact-this insulated pouch will
keep a bottle of Prosecco cold...

07:18.484 --> 07:20.715
for an entire
Wiggles concert. Hi.

07:20.844 --> 07:24.155
Uh, Mitch, it's Dr.- Bob Jensen.
Nice to meet you.

07:24.284 --> 07:26.162
Jay, I will see you.
Yeah, I'll see you then.

07:26.244 --> 07:27.802
Good, Bob.

07:30.244 --> 07:33.520
Doctor? Sweater vest?
My dad acting all shifty?

07:33.604 --> 07:35.436
He was seeing a shrink.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.674
"Dad, I can see that you're
going through something."

07:37.763 --> 07:42.155
"And I can see your bra strap, Oprah.
Mind your own business."

07:42.244 --> 07:46.203
Tee up the football all you want, Lucy.
Still ain't kickin'.

07:46.283 --> 07:48.594
She clearly misheard
the question.

07:48.684 --> 07:50.402
The acoustics in here
are terrible.

07:50.484 --> 07:53.396
Especially for a little girl just
getting over an ear infection.

07:53.483 --> 07:54.882
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

07:55.002 --> 07:57.471
I was explaining your-Oh, I
heard, because my ears are fine.

07:57.562 --> 07:59.156
I'm sorry. I didn't
ask her to do this.

07:59.282 --> 08:01.843
I'm trying to help you. No, you were not.
You were trying to help you.

08:01.923 --> 08:04.312
You're just mad because now you can't
parade me around like some show pony.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.752
That is not true. Oh, don't deny it.
You bought the two-day cushion.

08:06.843 --> 08:10.678
Who are you to judge?

08:13.562 --> 08:16.839
Oh, look at him.

08:22.923 --> 08:26.519
Thank you for a fun day, okay?
Good-bye. Good-bye?

08:26.603 --> 08:28.639
Ay, Cam. Sorry,
but the lunch was two hours,

08:28.723 --> 08:30.641
and then you had to show me
your first apartment.

08:30.682 --> 08:32.354
Oh, could you believe
how I used to live?

08:32.442 --> 08:33.921
I really need
to take a nap now.

08:34.001 --> 08:36.562
No. No, no. No. No. No, no.
No, no. You know what?

08:36.640 --> 08:39.280
I have, uh, something I want you to do
that's even more relaxing than a nap.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.073
No. I want to take a nap.
Yeah.

08:42.602 --> 08:44.116
There's my man.

08:44.202 --> 08:46.272
That's me. Your man.

08:46.362 --> 08:48.512
I brought spinach dip.
I don't know why.

08:48.602 --> 08:50.673
I'll tell you why. 'Cause it's
delicious, and you're an awesome guest.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.275
- Get in here.
- All right.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.314
How are you?
Good. You?

08:54.401 --> 08:57.520
By the way, I left a message for my
brother-in-law and his partner to join us too.

08:57.602 --> 09:00.117
Oh, more people. Good.

09:00.242 --> 09:03.155
Nice house, by the way.
Thanks.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.360
Wait a minute. Is that your family?
Are you married?

09:06.482 --> 09:09.235
Yeah, but don't worry. We have the house to ourselves.
They're all out of town.

09:09.321 --> 09:11.630
I am long overdue
for a boys' night.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.196
Oh, so your wife is
okay with-Oh, yeah.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.797
She suggested it. She knows
I need this every so often.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.712
Long as I clean up
afterwards, she's fine.

09:19.841 --> 09:21.752
Oh. You ready for a margarita?

09:21.841 --> 09:23.399
Sure.

09:27.481 --> 09:28.995
Soothing, right?

09:29.081 --> 09:32.756
You see, as the music relaxes
the baby, you relax.

09:32.841 --> 09:34.798
No, you're making the baby
jump on my bladder.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.595
How can it relax listening
to a song about a hooker?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.361
She's not a hooker.
She's a private dancer.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.471
A dancer for money. She'll
do what you want her to-

09:41.561 --> 09:43.040
My gosh.
I taught Lily this song.

09:43.121 --> 09:44.712
Excuse me.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.120
Hello?

09:46.200 --> 09:47.235
He's married.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.471
To a woman.
Yeah, she's out of town.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.472
I don't know. They must have some
sort of arrangement or something.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.677
So what? If they
know about it, who cares?

09:55.759 --> 09:58.355
You're not ready for a relationship anyway.
Just have some fun.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.908
It feels weird. He has
other people coming over.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.719
I think I'm gonna bail on this.

10:02.799 --> 10:05.315
He's just feeling you out
like you're feeling him out.

10:05.399 --> 10:08.153
Now I promise you, these other
guests will mysteriously cancel.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.919
Hold on
just a second, sweetie.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.440
Hello?

10:11.519 --> 10:13.033
Hey, you guys still coming?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.157
Oh, I forgot to call you.
We have to cancel.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.470
No problem. Bye.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.474
Hey. More margaritas for us.
The other guys just canceled.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.038
A re yo u s till there?

10:23.158 --> 10:25.753
You were right. The other
guys just canceled. See?

10:25.839 --> 10:27.910
Now listen to me. You're
gonna have two margaritas.

10:27.998 --> 10:30.229
Maybe start a third.
Laugh at his jokes.

10:30.319 --> 10:33.470
But not in that high falsetto thing.
Something more manly. Let's practice.

10:33.559 --> 10:36.835
Hey, I'm not gonna laugh for you. You
can be very controlling. You know that?

10:36.959 --> 10:39.872
Why does everybody say I'm controlling?
Oh. Gotta go.

10:41.158 --> 10:44.230
Looks like this kennel
is for bulldogs only.

10:46.199 --> 10:48.349
You all right? Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm great.

10:48.479 --> 10:51.755
Oh, good. Listen, uh, I-I don't
want this to sound weird,

10:51.839 --> 10:56.788
but, um-but you and I,
tonight, is this, uh-

10:56.918 --> 11:00.194
♪ ♪ Sorry, Dave, what was that?

11:01.198 --> 11:02.677
Nothing.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.118
Here you go.

11:13.198 --> 11:15.666
For a small fee, we can come to
your house and assemble it for you.

11:15.757 --> 11:17.589
Yeah, my dad's more
of a do-it-yourself er.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.954
Plus he's not one for strangers
in his personal space.

11:20.037 --> 11:22.473
All right. Uh, well, can I
help you carry it to your car?

11:22.558 --> 11:24.118
Yeah, he's not gonna
go for that either.

11:24.238 --> 11:26.198
The guy won't even use
the wheels on his suitcase.

11:26.238 --> 11:29.231
Likes everyone to think he's this
big, tough guy who-Okay. Wow.

11:29.318 --> 11:31.310
Yo! There he is. All right.
Let's get this done.

11:31.397 --> 11:32.877
Hey, Dad, you know-

11:32.958 --> 11:35.712
No. We don't need any help, Mitchell.
Just pick up your end.

11:38.717 --> 11:40.992
- Dad, stop, stop, stop.
- What? A break already?

11:41.077 --> 11:42.909
Dad, you're obviously
going through something.

11:42.996 --> 11:46.194
You do not have to go through this alone.
I'm here to talk if you want.

11:46.276 --> 11:49.554
That's really nice of you,
Mitchell, but do you wanna do it here?

11:49.676 --> 11:52.953
'Cause I saw a little princess
table with a tea set on it.

11:53.036 --> 11:54.868
You and I could have
a real gabfest.

11:54.957 --> 11:58.472
Aaugh! I'm such a blockhead.

11:58.557 --> 12:00.150
Can't we just get this
into the car?

12:00.237 --> 12:01.829
Why? So you're not late
for your shrink session?

12:01.916 --> 12:05.671
- What?
- Yeah. I picked up on that. Bunny hugger! Saw that too.

12:05.756 --> 12:07.429
Mobile spinner.

12:09.276 --> 12:10.870
I swear to God-

12:13.597 --> 12:15.633
What are you doing back here?

12:15.716 --> 12:18.316
I didn't have the room key, and I
don't want to be seen in public.

12:18.356 --> 12:20.347
I thought about
what you said before-

12:20.436 --> 12:23.508
- When did China's last
emperor ascend the throne? - 1909.

12:23.635 --> 12:25.837
1920? And you can say
a lot of things about me,

12:25.915 --> 12:27.635
but I am not someone who lives
through her kids.

12:27.795 --> 12:31.187
Sorry. it's 1909. Do I like
to see you succeed? Of course I do!

12:31.275 --> 12:33.665
- Tritium is an isotope of what element?
- Hydrogen.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.947
But do I need that to make myself
feel important? Uranium?

12:37.076 --> 12:38.556
Absolutely not.

12:38.635 --> 12:40.194
No, the answer is hydrogen.

12:40.275 --> 12:43.188
As a matter of fact, I'm a little hurt
you would think I was so shallow.

12:43.275 --> 12:45.665
The Persian satrapy of Skudra
included which two areas?

12:45.795 --> 12:47.355
- Macedonia and Thrace.
- Uh-

12:47.476 --> 12:51.789
- I know moms like that, and that is not me.
- No way.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.389
Macedonia and Thrace.

12:53.475 --> 12:54.908
Are you freaking kidding me?

12:54.994 --> 12:58.147
Macedonia and Thrace?
What even is that?

12:58.235 --> 13:01.387
You were hardly even listening!
How could we lose this?

13:02.634 --> 13:04.115
I said "we."

13:04.195 --> 13:05.868
Yeah.
You do that sometimes.

13:06.994 --> 13:10.432
I'm so sorry.
I am one of those moms.

13:10.514 --> 13:12.471
I like it too much
when you win.

13:12.555 --> 13:15.149
I really love lording it
over the other moms.

13:15.235 --> 13:18.990
Well, in our house, I'm
kind of your only source for that.

13:19.075 --> 13:21.543
You're telling me.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.831
Haley e-mails me
pictures of her nails.

13:23.914 --> 13:25.667
And Luke asked me
if he's part owl.

13:25.754 --> 13:27.871
He does get his head
pretty far around.

13:27.955 --> 13:30.311
Alex, I'm so sorry.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.512
It's okay. Maybe you
do put pressure on me,

13:33.594 --> 13:35.631
but it's nothing compared
to what I put on myself.

13:35.714 --> 13:39.548
I guess I needed somebody to blame for
what happened today, and there you were.

13:39.633 --> 13:42.103
You know I'm in awe
of you, right?

13:43.474 --> 13:46.272
Come on. I know a back
way out of this place.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.671
Don't you have to return that? No way.
I paid good money for this.

13:49.834 --> 13:51.711
We're taking it down the waterslide.
Okay.

13:51.793 --> 13:54.434
How can she not be here
either? This is hopeless.

13:54.513 --> 13:56.186
Have a little faith.

13:56.273 --> 13:59.551
Did the Jews give up when the Egyptians
chased them to the banks of the Red Sea?

13:59.673 --> 14:04.065
How do you know all this stuff? Was I the
only one listening to Uncle Menachem's toast?

14:04.153 --> 14:05.792
Well, I'm glad it worked out
for the ancient Jews,

14:05.913 --> 14:08.304
but at the moment I don't
see God doing me any-Look!

14:08.393 --> 14:11.305
- I thought he was joking.
- I thought that what's what you thought.

14:13.073 --> 14:16.305
Oh, my God! Yes! Yes!

14:16.392 --> 14:20.069
I'm not gonna embarrass you, but you
got one minute to get out of here.

14:21.073 --> 14:22.553
You too.

14:24.433 --> 14:28.949
It's for the best. All this sneaking
around was kind of weighing on me.

14:29.073 --> 14:31.189
Let's just grab our
gift bags and go. No.

14:31.272 --> 14:33.390
I still have 50 seconds.

14:34.392 --> 14:36.748
Excuse me.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.313
Hi.

14:38.392 --> 14:40.031
My name is Manny Delgado,

14:40.113 --> 14:42.833
and I've been searching for you since
you smiled at me in the lobby today.

14:42.912 --> 14:44.426
Maybe even my whole life.

14:44.512 --> 14:47.031
It's too late for us to have the
magical night I was hoping for,

14:47.072 --> 14:49.950
but it's not too late for us to have
a memento of what might have been.

14:50.031 --> 14:51.910
I'll be waiting.

15:05.271 --> 15:06.910
Okay, Mitch-

15:06.991 --> 15:08.472
Too late.
Not interested.

15:08.592 --> 15:11.265
Now listen.

15:11.352 --> 15:13.184
Okay, you know what?
I'm just gonna go out the back.

15:13.271 --> 15:15.228
Doors, sunroof-
all on lockdown.

15:17.112 --> 15:20.549
Okay, look. That guy you
met today, he is a shrink.

15:20.631 --> 15:22.225
But I don't see him
all the time.

15:22.312 --> 15:25.110
You mom and I saw him
a little before the divorce.

15:25.191 --> 15:29.184
But every now and then, something comes
up for me and I go in for a tune-up.

15:29.270 --> 15:31.865
If you're waiting for me to ask
what's going on with you,

15:31.951 --> 15:35.023
you just better keep waiting,
'cause I learned my lesson.

15:35.111 --> 15:38.308
I'm down about something-
something I knew was coming,

15:38.390 --> 15:41.144
and now it's finally happening.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.668
We're turning my office
into the nursery today.

15:46.191 --> 15:50.184
You've been moping around like you
lost your platoon over a room?

15:50.270 --> 15:51.750
Not just a room.

15:51.870 --> 15:54.340
It's the only place in this house
where I can still close the door...

15:54.431 --> 15:56.070
and read a book
or have a drink.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.982
Everything in there was mine.

15:58.111 --> 16:00.591
Ah, who cares?
Everybody's got their problems.

16:00.670 --> 16:03.310
No.

16:03.389 --> 16:06.985
See, I can still open my door. You
just locked yourself back in.

16:08.989 --> 16:13.143
Look, Dad, I-I had to give up my
home office for Lily's bedroom,

16:13.230 --> 16:14.869
and I was upset about it too.

16:15.989 --> 16:18.061
I wasn't hugging
bunnies, but-All right.

16:18.190 --> 16:22.787
I- I realize that it wasn't
about an office or a room.

16:22.869 --> 16:25.590
It was about how Lily
was gonna change everything.

16:25.669 --> 16:28.504
But once we got her in there-

16:28.590 --> 16:30.865
I don't know. I-I just-
I never looked back.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.182
Yeah, I guess I'm just nervous
about everything, you know.

16:34.269 --> 16:35.989
Yeah.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.140
Thanks, kid.

16:38.230 --> 16:42.620
You know, I'm just recalling me grumbling
about giving up my MG roadster...

16:42.709 --> 16:44.267
when you and Claire came along.

16:44.349 --> 16:46.863
Great car.
No backseat.

16:46.949 --> 16:49.099
Isn't it funny? The stupid
things that we think-

16:49.229 --> 16:52.859
She was my baby.
...are so important.

16:53.028 --> 16:55.589
I guess all told,
we had about 50 chickens.

16:55.668 --> 16:57.661
Maybe 115 head of hogs.

16:57.748 --> 17:00.024
Let's see, 55 cattle.
Oh, you know what'll be fun?

17:00.109 --> 17:02.704
Let's see if I can remember
all their names. There was-

17:02.788 --> 17:05.509
Albert, Lisa,
Steph and Mike

17:05.589 --> 17:07.102
Gloria! No, Gloria!

17:07.188 --> 17:08.464
Gloria.

17:08.549 --> 17:12.064
No. I do not want to hear
one more story.

17:12.188 --> 17:14.579
I am going to take a nap now.
Okay, yeah, sure.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.626
Whatever you want.
This day's about you.

17:16.789 --> 17:18.905
Just one more thing-
No, no one more thing!

17:19.028 --> 17:21.303
I just wanted to take a picture, you
know, to commemorate our special day.

17:21.387 --> 17:23.140
Okay, fine!
Take the picture!

17:23.227 --> 17:24.945
No, not here.
The lighting's terrible.

17:25.028 --> 17:28.146
I was thinking we could take
it in your new nursery!

17:31.748 --> 17:33.501
No, Cam. No.

17:33.627 --> 17:35.983
But, Gloria, come-Somebody
has to tell you this.

17:36.068 --> 17:38.344
No. You try to
control everything.

17:38.427 --> 17:40.146
You take over people's life!

17:40.308 --> 17:44.620
It's always too much with you! Maybe we
should talk about this out in the hallway.

17:44.707 --> 17:47.176
Why, because there's gonna be
better lighting over there?

17:47.268 --> 17:50.625
You're doing it again, Cam.
You're doing it again!

17:52.108 --> 17:54.941
You're right. I am too much.
I do control. I do barge.

17:55.027 --> 17:57.666
I'll have my friend Abelard
come back and paint over it.

17:57.787 --> 18:00.097
So this is why you
kept me outside all day?

18:00.186 --> 18:03.942
So that your friend Averar
could come and paint a present?

18:04.027 --> 18:06.905
Rather than getting you a gift off
your registry like a normal person.

18:07.027 --> 18:08.983
I'm so stupid.
I love it!

18:09.107 --> 18:11.985
You do?
It's just like you-

18:12.067 --> 18:15.219
full of color and life
and love.

18:15.386 --> 18:18.060
Mmm. Oh, I really did
think you'd love it.

18:18.146 --> 18:21.424
What's going on up here?
What the-

18:21.507 --> 18:23.543
Okay, that was not
my idea. I told Cam-

18:23.666 --> 18:25.818
I told him that's a lot to put
on someone's wall. Hold on.

18:25.906 --> 18:27.546
I like it.

18:27.626 --> 18:29.936
Really? Oh.
Thanks, Cam.

18:30.107 --> 18:33.416
You actually-Makes it
easier to give up the room.

18:33.506 --> 18:35.498
The ruling
on the field is gonna stand.

18:35.625 --> 18:39.586
We know they saw the same thing upstairs we see here.
Not gonna get a better angle than that.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.935
Wow, that's close.

18:42.026 --> 18:43.904
Guy was an inch out of bounds.

18:43.986 --> 18:48.184
Oh.

18:48.266 --> 18:50.178
Time-out.

18:50.306 --> 18:53.344
You know what?

18:53.465 --> 18:56.026
I'm not gonna be able to relax
until I get this out of the way.

18:59.546 --> 19:00.980
Dishwasher.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.383
Pretty cool, huh?

19:04.506 --> 19:08.704
Yeah, it is. Um, hey,
do you think-Oh.

19:08.826 --> 19:11.056
You mind if I freshen this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Allow me.

19:12.065 --> 19:14.660
Wow. Your hand's shaking.

19:14.745 --> 19:17.578
Remember, Dave,
it's just a game.

19:21.904 --> 19:25.454
Oh! Oh! Oh, God! Oh, my God!

19:25.585 --> 19:27.416
Gosh.
Oh, come here.

19:27.505 --> 19:29.258
It's all right. I'm-I'm
just a little wet.

19:29.345 --> 19:31.222
No, you're drenched.
You can't sit in that.

19:31.305 --> 19:33.864
You know what? Take that off. I'll
throw 'em both in the dryer...

19:33.904 --> 19:35.816
and get us a couple
of clean ones.

19:35.944 --> 19:37.095
Okay.
Yeah.

19:37.184 --> 19:38.904
Well, I guess this is
something we're doing.

19:38.985 --> 19:41.374
Interception.

19:41.505 --> 19:42.904
Interception!
Oh!

19:43.025 --> 19:45.335
Come on, buddy!
Come on!

19:45.464 --> 19:47.343
Come on! Come on, buddy!
Touchdown!

19:47.424 --> 19:49.415
Yeah!

19:49.504 --> 19:50.903
How exciting is this?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.623
Oh, it's been so long.

19:53.744 --> 19:57.215
What's happening? Oh, nothing.
My car keys.

19:57.344 --> 19:59.460
Shoot. The TV went off. Oh.

19:59.544 --> 20:01.456
Must have screwed something up.

20:01.544 --> 20:03.819
You know what? It doesn't matter.
There's another one upstairs.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.863
How about we head up to the bedroom
for some halftime festivities?

20:06.943 --> 20:09.698
Oh. Oh, okay.

20:09.784 --> 20:12.298
Let's do this.

20:15.304 --> 20:17.216
I'd forgotten how
much fun this can be.

20:17.304 --> 20:18.977
We should make this
a regular thing.

20:19.064 --> 20:20.976
Phil. Phil, wait.

20:21.064 --> 20:23.020
I think I'd better
just head home.

20:23.104 --> 20:26.494
- What?
- I'm just coming out of a long-term relationship,

20:26.583 --> 20:28.778
and I guess I'm still
pretty fragile.

20:28.862 --> 20:32.094
It's not that I haven't
had a great time.

20:32.182 --> 20:35.062
No, no. I get it. I've spent a
few nights in Heartbreak Hotel.

20:35.142 --> 20:37.020
If there's anything I can do-

20:37.103 --> 20:40.413
You've already
done more than you know.

20:53.303 --> 20:54.657
Huh.

20:58.783 --> 21:00.775
Ohhh.

21:24.141 --> 21:25.371
Get away from me.
Uh!
