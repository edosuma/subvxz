00:22.723 --> 00:24.257
We got a special treat
for you tonight.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.892
Our original bassist
and founding Stain,

00:25.893 --> 00:27.294
Cynthia Taylor's here tonight.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.564
1, 2, 3, 4...

00:38.906 --> 00:42.642
♫ I looked at you
and I saw trouble ♫

00:42.643 --> 00:46.179
♫ And I came running
on the double ♫

00:46.180 --> 00:49.449
♫ I made myself
somebody's breakfast ♫

00:49.450 --> 00:53.853
♫ So comfortable
upon that plate ♫

00:53.854 --> 00:57.524
♫ Ah-ah, ah-ah ♫

00:57.525 --> 01:00.393
♫ I do not know
where this began ♫

01:00.394 --> 01:04.797
♫ But I'm out of
this flight to hell ♫

01:04.798 --> 01:08.668
♫ Ah-ah, ah-ah ♫

01:08.669 --> 01:10.371
♫ Ah-ah ♫

01:16.477 --> 01:18.145
Hey.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.279
Just like old times, right?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.248
Huh.
Yeah, minus the rage.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.483
That's true, we were both
fuckin' maniacs.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.885
What's wrong with
your hand?

01:25.886 --> 01:28.155
Tweaked it.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.322
Can I get you a drink?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.723
No, I'm good.
I'd love to,

01:30.724 --> 01:33.826
but I've gotta wake up
with the kids.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.170
It's good seeing you, Cyn.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.305
Yeah.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.807
All right!
Nailed it.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.277
Ah-ah! Ah-ah!

01:50.278 --> 01:51.778
- Did you?
- Yeah, of course.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.880
Last call.
Last call for drinks.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.715
- You were amazing.
- It was only five chords.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.251
It's not exactly Mozart.
Let's go someplace else.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.419
Where to?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.020
I have an idea.
Come on.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.422
- Come on.
- We're taking the Uber.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.756
- Oh.
- All right.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.196
Shh. Okay?
Shh, shh, shh.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.863
They didn't change the locks.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.633
- Shh.
Dee Dee,
you got anything?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.935
- Absolutely.
- Go on in.

02:15.936 --> 02:16.936
Tanya.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.575
- There it is.
- Wow.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.345
- Home.
- Wow.

02:26.079 --> 02:30.983
I've even got
the whiskey.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.619
- Dee Dee.
- Yeah.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.587
What was
the name of that guy,
that trumpet player

02:34.588 --> 02:36.022
- that subbed?
- Which one?

02:36.023 --> 02:38.225
The one...
Big blond guy...

02:38.226 --> 02:40.260
Terrible flatulence.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.961
Himmelfart.

02:41.962 --> 02:46.233
He... Only man in the world
who could blow a trumpet
out of his ass.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.134
See that?

02:48.135 --> 02:50.136
- What's his real name?
- Himmelfarb.

02:50.137 --> 02:53.306
- What?
- Thomas J. Himmelfarb,
London Philharmonic.

02:53.307 --> 02:57.510
Wh... How did you
remember that?

02:57.511 --> 02:58.645
I slept with him.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.813
- Oh, gross.
- God, really?

03:00.814 --> 03:03.383
- Real cute.
- Oh, yeah. Cute.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.454
One of my girls called me
a loser yesterday.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.423
Oh, man. I'm sure
she didn't mean it.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.259
Oh, no.
She definitely did.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.461
- Dee Dee,
how you doin' anyway?
- Everything's good.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.496
And my wife just, uh,
kicked me out.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.365
- What?
- Oh, Dee Dee.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.100
It's okay.
There's a... There's
a gas station nearby

03:21.101 --> 03:23.270
that has a very,
very nice bathroom.

03:23.271 --> 03:27.039
- I'm reliving my 40s.
- All these different people
getting into my car.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.810
It just... It's a reminder
of how connected we all are.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.880
You know, it's really nice.
It's actually pretty cool.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.717
- That's cool.
- Yeah. And, um...

03:37.718 --> 03:39.586
- I met a nice woman.
- Yeah?

03:39.587 --> 03:42.622
- Yeah, she only had a 4.6.
- I'd never say it, but

03:42.623 --> 03:45.758
- Virgil goes to work...
- I think it's because
she drank a lot of water...

03:45.759 --> 03:48.495
And I'm just there
with the baby.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.729
I want to scream.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.301
Oh! Shh, shh.
Be quiet.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.636
Hi, honey.

03:56.637 --> 03:59.907
No, no, the concert's over
and I'm at a bar.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.910
Well, it's a silent bar.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.313
- Yeah, it's a trend now.
- Fuck!

04:06.314 --> 04:07.580
- Oh.
- Shh!

04:07.581 --> 04:09.816
They allow dogs in here
it turns out.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.754
- Gah! Get out!
- Oh, shit.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.822
- Damnit!
- Warren, you okay?

04:15.823 --> 04:18.024
Warren.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.927
Uh, losing service.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
have to call you back.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.994
- Bye.
- Uh-oh.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.564
- Interlopers!
- Warren. Oh, my God.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.798
- No, no, no, no!
- Warren, stop this.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.367
- Oh, my...
- They don't belong here!

04:27.368 --> 04:29.035
The bubble machine
is not the problem.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.137
- Turn that off.
- Gazillon bubble show.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.105
- Dee Dee, what are you doing?
Featuring
Melody Yang.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.608
- All right, I'll get it.
- Get up, Bob.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.210
Turn the lights on,
maybe that'll help.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.613
I know where the lights are.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.683
That was the fire alarm!

04:43.684 --> 04:47.787
- Come on.
- Ah, and now goes
the sprinklers.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.356
Can you turn it off?

04:49.357 --> 04:50.790
Warren, baby, we gotta go.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.492
- Warren, come on.
- It's time to go home.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.594
- Tanya, this way,
come on guys.
- Dee Dee.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.496
- Come on.
- Let's go, go,
we gotta go.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.765
We gotta get out.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.242
I don't want to move my head,

05:10.243 --> 05:12.745
because I was just...

05:12.746 --> 05:15.048
I was just dreaming
what we did last night.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.918
I've been dreaming about it
all the time,

05:18.919 --> 05:22.389
and I go over and over it again.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.626
It was...

05:28.128 --> 05:30.798
You are okay?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.000
Alessandra?

05:36.570 --> 05:38.038
Alessandra?

05:44.277 --> 05:45.446
Oh.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.934
Alessandra?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.642
- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.544
Hey, Alessandra...
Hai Lai...

06:17.545 --> 06:18.978
- Yeah?
- Have you seen Alessandra?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.481
Uh, no, I thought that
she was coming with you.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.116
No, no, she's not
coming with me.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.485
I don't know.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.655
Hey, buon giorno, Vlad.
Alessandra?

06:28.656 --> 06:32.091
- Andata.
- Andata? Andata?

06:32.092 --> 06:34.561
- Putamadre, andata?
- What's andata?

06:34.562 --> 06:37.564
- Ai.
- What's andata?

06:37.565 --> 06:38.598
Ai.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.900
Okay, fine, I can Google it.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.203
- She's gone.
- She's gone?

06:44.204 --> 06:45.271
Oh, fuck.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.139
Putamadre.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.240
- Maestro.
- Si.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.709
We are ready to begin.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.478
Si, Si, Si, Si.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.713
Si.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.150
You!
What have you done?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.487
- Where is she?
- She left in the boat.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.655
What did you do? Huh?

07:02.656 --> 07:05.558
You made love to her.
After I told you no fornicata,

07:05.559 --> 07:08.495
please, no fornicata,
and you did fornicate,
didn't you?

07:08.496 --> 07:09.896
Who uses that word anymore?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.898
Nobody. Right?
Nobody.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.066
And Si. Si,
andiamo fornicato,

07:14.067 --> 07:17.103
but it was beautiful.
It was mature,
it was eccentric,

07:17.104 --> 07:18.805
it was athletic,
it was artistic!

07:18.806 --> 07:20.239
You should have seen it,
it was incredible.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.641
What's the problem with that?

07:21.642 --> 07:23.510
I should have told her
the moment she said your name.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.278
No! Not that one!
Anyone else!

07:26.279 --> 07:28.515
He's a devil
with beautiful eyes!

07:28.516 --> 07:29.749
Why are you so dramatic?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.184
Why? Why, why,
why, Hai Lai?

07:32.185 --> 07:36.255
Why am I surrounded by
these dramatic people
all the time, why?

07:36.256 --> 07:37.690
Okay. All right.
Come on. Get up.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.425
Get up. Come on.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.861
Maestro, Maestro,
I am very sorry but
we must rehearse.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.630
- Why?
- Just breathe.
Just breathe.

07:43.631 --> 07:47.066
- Ai... Ai!
- Did you really
sleep with her?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.401
- Of course I did!
We just slept once!
- Okay. Okay, no...

07:49.402 --> 07:51.838
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong
with that.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.806
- There's nothing wrong
with that, right?
- Nothing's wrong with that.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.675
I mean, what's wrong is
the... this thing of, like,

07:55.676 --> 07:57.610
you... you can't do this,
you can't do this shit.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.878
What are you, her father?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.279
No.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.313
I'm her husband.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.348
- What?
- Yeah!

08:02.349 --> 08:04.250
For two weeks 15 years ago.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.418
The marriage was annulled, eh...

08:06.419 --> 08:08.855
She changed her mind.
She's like that.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.090
But that is not the problem.

08:11.091 --> 08:15.427
The problem is when
she makes love.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.863
She loses her voice.
Capito?

08:16.864 --> 08:18.297
How?

08:18.298 --> 08:20.399
- Ha...
- You have to get her
to come back.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.901
I don't care about the money.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.571
She is the only thing
I care about.
She has to sing.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.472
She never going to be happy
if she doesn't sing.

08:26.473 --> 08:30.442
Yes, yes, okay, Beppi.
Where would she go if
she was running away?

08:30.443 --> 08:31.611
- Torcello.
- Torcello.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.912
The place where
she grew up is there.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.481
I will find you a boat,
but hurry, eh? Hurry.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.049
Okay, okay.
Vamos, Hai Lai.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.485
Okay, okay.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.886
- Maestro.
- Si.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.222
- We are ready.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.959
No.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.461
Comañeros, I'm... I'm in
a little bit of a...

08:49.462 --> 08:50.763
of a situation right now.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.499
So I have to be absent
for a few minutes, okay?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.068
But I leave you in
the capable hands
of my associate,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.204
Hai Lai Rutledge.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.306
Okay, she's very good.
Come, come, Hai Lai.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.442
Yes. She's very good.
She plays with the blood.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.945
- She knows
what I want. Ciao.
- I do? Okay.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.279
- Yes.
- No, I'm not ready for this.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.681
Hai Lai, what?
Yes, you are.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.683
You wanted an opportunity,
okay, you have to take it.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.719
This is the type of
opportunity you need, okay?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.520
- Take it. Take it.
Come on.
- Can you just give me a...

09:14.521 --> 09:16.522
- a slight bit more detail
about what...
- Okay, okay.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.824
It has to be very staccato,
you know?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.525
It has to be like
the wings of, um... um...

09:19.526 --> 09:21.127
- Of a hummingbird.
- No, no.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.394
- Hurry, please.
- Si, Si, Si. Si, Si.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.130
- Of, um...
- Of a plane?

09:24.131 --> 09:26.365
- No, no, okay.
In the piu animato...
- Okay.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.735
- To the presto, okay?
It has to be tight.
- Okay.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.170
- It has to be together, okay?
It can't be separate.
- Okay. All right.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.640
- All right? And in bar 129...
- Oh. Ah! Rodrigo, thank God.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.407
- Gloria. What the...
- Thank God, Rodrigo,
things are spiraling

09:35.408 --> 09:38.010
- What are you doing here?
- dangerously out of control.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.378
Out of control completely.
I have to go. Sorry.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.713
- Yes, it's very dangerous.
- No, no!

09:40.714 --> 09:42.649
Hello, Gloria.
Okay, so wait.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.451
- The piu animato
to bar 129...
- Ah, yeah, 129, okay.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.954
Just... You can do this,
Hai Lai, everything is in
my score, okay?

09:47.955 --> 09:49.689
Just try to make it, like,
as French as possible,

09:49.690 --> 09:51.490
like trying to pretend
to be Spanish, okay?

09:51.491 --> 09:53.292
- A French person...
- A French person trying
to be Spanish. Okay.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.827
- Okay, okay. Bye-bye.
- What's all this kerfuffle?

09:54.828 --> 09:56.228
- Maestro.
- Ha. Ha. Ha!

09:56.229 --> 09:58.397
- A mano.
- So good to see you.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.399
- Yeah, I... I...
I have a thing tonight.
- Si, Si, Si. Si.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.468
- Yes.
- I did try to call you
about this.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.503
I heard about it,
but I have to go
because I have a...

10:04.504 --> 10:07.539
- Diva on the loose.
- Rodrigo, stop running,
you bloody wanker!

10:07.540 --> 10:09.241
Wanker?
What's a wanker?

10:09.242 --> 10:12.211
You know perfectly well
what a bloody wanker is,
you bloody wanker.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.180
- What? What the...
- Rodrigo, please!

10:14.181 --> 10:15.782
- Vai, vai, vai!
- You have to come back.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.416
The family is dying.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.318
If there is no music,
there is no family.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.320
The family's broken,
the spell is broken!

10:21.321 --> 10:24.857
No! No!
What do you mean
the spell is broken?

10:24.858 --> 10:27.226
Follow that boat.
Follow that boat.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.863
The spell goes on and on
and on, Rodrigo, please,

10:30.864 --> 10:33.365
- you have to come back!
- ♫ La Donna e mobile ♫

10:33.366 --> 10:35.134
- ♫ Quai piuma Al vento ♫
- Stop! Stop!

10:35.135 --> 10:38.237
Sit, sit. Sit right...
Sit, sit there.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.472
Rodrigo. Stop!
If you don't come back,

10:40.473 --> 10:41.941
I'm going to resign!

10:41.942 --> 10:44.944
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you, Gloria.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.245
- I don't believe that.
- I may do worse.

10:46.246 --> 10:50.683
I agree.
He is a bloody wanker.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.451
Do I know you?

10:52.452 --> 10:57.089
Rodrigo, I came
all the way from New York
to talk to you.

10:57.090 --> 11:02.328
Presto, presto!
Presto!

11:14.474 --> 11:18.077
Hello.
So, uh, the Maestro
just briefed me,

11:18.078 --> 11:21.113
and he...
he told me everything
that I need to know,

11:21.114 --> 11:25.584
so, um, yeah,
I just want to say, um...

11:25.585 --> 11:29.923
It's a real honor to be
in front of a group of
such outstanding musicians.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.093
Excuse me,
which piece are we
to start with?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.763
Oh, um,
"Chanson Boheme."

11:36.764 --> 11:38.564
And we practice with La Fiamma?

11:38.565 --> 11:39.932
Uh, no, we can't, actually,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.768
because we need to do this.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.870
- And where is she?
- Um, it's actually
really good

11:43.871 --> 11:45.537
that we have this opportunity,

11:45.538 --> 11:48.640
because we have
this whole musical intro
before the vocal melody.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.043
If we could do it this time, um,

11:51.044 --> 11:54.947
like, uh, very light,
uh, very fast, like...

11:54.948 --> 11:56.315
like a hummingbird.
Like a...

11:56.316 --> 11:58.617
Perhaps, young lady,
we try first,

11:58.618 --> 12:00.219
and then you adjust?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.654
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Sorry.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.424
Okay, huh?
All right.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.658
1, 2, 3,

12:06.659 --> 12:10.863
- 1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3...
- ♫♫

12:10.864 --> 12:14.801
1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3,

12:14.802 --> 12:18.938
1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3,

12:18.939 --> 12:22.842
1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3,

12:22.843 --> 12:25.044
1, 2, 3...

12:25.045 --> 12:27.713
Okay, okay, uh,
let's stop, actually.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.448
That was great.
I think, though,

12:29.449 --> 12:32.151
that we can be
lighter and faster,

12:32.152 --> 12:35.421
um, more bird-like,
and also, uh, French.

12:35.422 --> 12:41.327
Like, just more French.

12:45.833 --> 12:50.502
Okay.
Um... all right.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.538
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, absolutely fine.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.541
Okay, cool.
Let's do it again.

13:00.480 --> 13:05.117
1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3,

13:05.118 --> 13:09.188
1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3...

13:09.189 --> 13:12.424
Uh-uh, stop, stop.
It still feels a little slow.

13:12.425 --> 13:18.364
Um... Hey, uh,
can I actually
borrow your oboe?

13:21.001 --> 13:23.402
Miss America,
Miss Mickey Mouse...

13:25.438 --> 13:28.407
She said she understands.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.377
I heard Mickey Mouse.
Okay.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.387
You know what?
Let's come back to this.

13:41.388 --> 13:46.292
Um, okay,
so we are going to
skip ahead to the coda.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.628
Let's take it from piu animato,

13:49.629 --> 13:52.164
uh, figure number 13.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.935
Okay?

13:55.936 --> 13:59.438
All right.
1, 2,3...

14:05.312 --> 14:07.579
Okay, um, yeah, let's stop.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.182
Stop. Stop.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.452
Okay, can we stop?
Guys, stop.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.555
Okay, listen to me.
Guys, can you please
listen to me?

14:17.391 --> 14:19.058
Will you please listen to me?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.492
I really don't want to be
yelling right now.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.995
Please listen to me!

14:22.996 --> 14:24.563
Do me a favor and
please take this from me.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.465
I have no fucking idea
what I'm doing, okay?

14:26.466 --> 14:28.935
You've been bloodied.
Happens to everyone.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.802
Hey, get right back up there.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.941
Silencio!

14:34.942 --> 14:36.042
Right.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.244
This is one of my
favorite pieces.

14:38.245 --> 14:42.514
Please try not to ruin it.
Are we ready?

14:57.797 --> 14:58.965
What's your problem?

14:58.966 --> 15:01.200
Every time you try to conduct,

15:01.201 --> 15:04.670
the musicians just stop playing.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.973
Why did this one stop singing?

15:06.974 --> 15:09.175
Is it because you're
such a terrible lover?

15:09.176 --> 15:12.344
Mm, no, it's actually
because of the opposite.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.880
Yeah. But you...
you wouldn't know,

15:14.881 --> 15:16.015
you wouldn't know
about these things.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.985
I do know,
and I tell you one thing.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.519
If this concert doesn't happen,

15:20.520 --> 15:23.489
none of the guys
are gonna trust you
to conduct their work.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.457
Which guys?

15:24.458 --> 15:26.425
You know.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.060
Like, you mean, "the guys"?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.096
We all talk.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.031
Mirdra.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.544
Alessandra!

16:05.065 --> 16:06.233
Alessandra.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.041
Alessandra.
Hey.

16:15.042 --> 16:18.310
You speak?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.778
No?

16:19.779 --> 16:23.049
What... What are you doing
in a barrel?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.316
Hiding.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.087
- From me?
- From the ducks.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.793
So, uh, how's your voice?
Is it okay?

16:34.794 --> 16:36.095
- My voice?
- Yeah.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.629
Why wouldn't it be?

16:37.630 --> 16:40.232
Well, Beppi said that
when you make love,

16:40.233 --> 16:42.201
- that... that...
- Oh.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.070
Beppi believes everything.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.372
I told him that once
as an excuse

16:46.373 --> 16:49.075
so I could cancel
a performance at La Scala.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.611
Wow. That's so good.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.180
That's a good one.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.615
Well, um,
talking about performing,

16:56.616 --> 16:59.118
we have a rehearsal
going on right now.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.287
You know, I think
we should get back.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.356
No. I'm not
going to sing.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.391
Why?

17:05.392 --> 17:07.193
Why? Why not? Why...
This is crazy.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.395
Why not? Why?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.797
Because for you,
it is just a concert.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.833
And after it is over,
no matter how I sing,

17:14.834 --> 17:16.968
you will go back
to your family,
to your orchestra.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.137
Family, orch...
Wh... What orchestra
are you talking about?

17:19.138 --> 17:20.939
- I know they're on strike.
- Yes!

17:20.940 --> 17:22.508
Everyone knows
they're on strike.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.643
Well, now I'm on strike, too.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.378
No! No, you can't.
No. You must sing.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.315
Why?

17:28.316 --> 17:29.881
Because the world needs you.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.951
But they already have me
with all those recordings.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.287
What they want is the spectacle.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.589
If I sing beautifully,
it is good.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.658
If I'm terrible,
it is even better.

17:39.659 --> 17:43.229
They can say
I was there when
La Fiamma burned.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.997
Yes, but burned...
burned like
a phoenix, baby.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.135
Okay? I'm gonna
make sure of that.

17:49.136 --> 17:52.138
When we first met,
you told me there
is just one reason

17:52.139 --> 17:53.405
to do something important.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.674
- Yes.
- So tell me.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.876
What is the reason?

17:57.877 --> 17:59.278
Love.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.579
Love is the reason.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.748
- Love!
- Yes.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.684
You love just the music
and yourself.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.387
No! No, no!
I love... I love a lot.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.156
I love a lot.
I love you!

18:10.157 --> 18:11.490
I love you even more.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.925
You love me more than yourself?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.962
Yes, because, you know,
there's days I don't
like myself so much.

18:16.963 --> 18:17.963
I love you more!

18:17.964 --> 18:19.431
But why should I trust you?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.867
You left your orchestra.
You will leave me.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.939
You will stay with me
even if there is a world tour?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.875
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.443
- Ai.
- Maybe!

18:31.444 --> 18:33.212
- Darling, come on.
- You see?

18:33.213 --> 18:35.247
- You don't love me.
- No, I love you!

18:35.248 --> 18:37.183
I love you!
Come here.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.285
I love you. We have
a performance tomorrow,

18:39.286 --> 18:40.486
and we have a rehearsal
right now.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.521
Come on,
let's just go. Okay?

18:42.522 --> 18:44.623
- You love me?
- I love you.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.926
- Of course I love you.
- You love me.

18:47.927 --> 18:48.927
Te amo.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.070
Thomas, look.
I brought your
cheering section.

19:32.071 --> 19:35.607
My rehearsal was cancelled,
so I'm here to party.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.376
And they're going crazy
out there.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.378
Yeah, yeah,
you wait 'til I
get out there.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.846
Dead silence.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.948
What, are you nervous?
That's so sweet.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.550
Yeah, well,
I'm a little bit nervous.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.585
I mean, I'm nervous to
shit my pants

19:46.586 --> 19:49.054
in front of the teenage Gestapo.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.789
No, don't you worry.
You look great.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.024
No, you look terrific.
You're gonna be great.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.027
Wait. Wait a minute.
Are you two a thing?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.062
- No! Yes.
- No. No.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.264
- No, no.
- Yes.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.266
No, no, what you're seeing

20:00.267 --> 20:02.834
is a perfectly healthy
professional relationship.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.336
Sure. We're fucking.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.804
Have been for months.
Great.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.773
You're beautiful,
and you're marvelous.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.409
- Signor, pronti.
- Ah, grazie. I... I have...

20:10.410 --> 20:12.711
Listen, um, I'm sorry, Gloria.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.112
The cat's out of the bag now.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.114
We can't do anything about it.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.549
It's true.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.084
But I'm so happy for you.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.919
Well, well,
thank you, thank you.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.621
So am I.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.723
Maestro Thomas Pembridge,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.458
You want to
say something?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.995
- Oh, sure.
- Here, here.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.832
Yes, well, I feel that I'm,
uh, bridging the gap

20:33.833 --> 20:38.970
between the classical music,
Beethoven, Mozart,

20:38.971 --> 20:41.072
and all those great masters,

20:41.073 --> 20:43.309
with, uh, robots.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.578
Oh, uh, I see, that's
the end of it, is it?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.179
- All right, thank you.
- Just play a couple bars...

20:48.180 --> 20:49.548
- Mm-hm.
- And I'll grab a loop,

20:49.549 --> 20:50.849
- and then, um...
- Oh, what does that mean?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.518
You know, you can riff
or you can, uh...

20:52.519 --> 20:54.219
- Grab a loop?
- Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.388
Oh, okay.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.876
Martians,
if you're listening...

21:17.877 --> 21:20.880
Welcome to the world,
motherfuckers! Yeeha!

21:22.715 --> 21:24.650
Martians,
if you're listening...

21:24.651 --> 21:27.252
Welcome to the world,
motherfuckers!

21:28.988 --> 21:30.589
They seem to know
the words.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.890
Yeah, yeah,
I released it last week.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.359
It's number one
in Korea already.

21:33.360 --> 21:37.029
Yeeha!

21:44.270 --> 21:46.373
Yeeha!

21:50.377 --> 21:52.812
Yeeha!

21:57.917 --> 22:01.052
Martians,
if you're listening...
