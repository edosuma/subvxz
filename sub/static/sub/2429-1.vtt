01:35.760 --> 01:38.161
All hands on deck.
Be advised.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.245
All good. All good.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.520
How'd you pull that off, Cole?

01:54.560 --> 01:56.961
Just a roughneck who got lucky.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.326
I see that.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.204
Hey, Mom. What are you doing?

02:56.400 --> 03:00.041
Thinking. Avoiding the dishes...

03:00.600 --> 03:03.922
- Nice out.
- It's beautiful.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.331
Yeah, it is.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.651
How are you doing?

03:11.960 --> 03:15.760
Just thinking about next fall.
About leaving.

03:15.880 --> 03:19.646
What's gonna happen to me.
Just the rest of my life. No big deal.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.571
You know, there are whole civilizations
that used to believe

03:23.680 --> 03:26.126
they could see their destiny
in the stars.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.731
You feel that kick?

03:43.440 --> 03:45.169
Mom, are you OK?

03:45.240 --> 03:46.366
Man that ramp!

03:56.360 --> 03:59.091
Blowout preventer!
Hit the blowout preventer!

04:09.880 --> 04:13.521
Hey, buddy! Hey, come here.
We're gonna get you out of here.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.723
Hey! Hey!

04:20.279 --> 04:21.519
Get him up the deck.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.641
Go!

04:33.600 --> 04:34.681
That's an...

05:12.520 --> 05:15.205
You're the company's
hero, Mr. Cole.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.363
Those two men you saved
are gonna be just fine.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.410
If your vitals stay stable,
you can go home tonight.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.731
It's incredible. You were in the
water almost four hours.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.930
No evidence of hypothermia.
The fall alone should have killed you.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.930
It's a miracle
that you're alive, Mr. Cole.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.651
There's just no other
word for it.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.364
Is there anyone we can call
to come get you or...?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.002
Uh, no. I'm good.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.528
<i>When I was young,
I looked for a shape to things.</i>

05:53.600 --> 05:56.001
<i>A reason or a design.</i>

05:56.080 --> 05:59.084
<i>So much of what happened to me,
though, felt like an accident.</i>

05:59.160 --> 06:01.162
<i>So I guess I lost faith
in all that.</i>

06:01.720 --> 06:04.291
<i>When I survived my fall,
I began to wonder</i>

06:04.360 --> 06:06.966
<i>if there wasn't some purpose to
my life.</i>

06:07.880 --> 06:10.042
<i>Maybe I was on a
destined path...</i>

06:11.400 --> 06:13.129
<i>...even if I couldn't
see it yet.</i>

06:18.240 --> 06:20.766
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:28.960 --> 06:31.088
You're looking good
in there, Michael Phelps.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.965
Hey, hey, have you
decided on a major yet?

06:34.080 --> 06:36.890
- Not really.
- He's thinking about finance.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.725
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.041
Look, it's tough out there
and it's getting tougher.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.849
Finance makes the most sense.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.321
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, grab me a Bud?
- Yeah.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.323
All I said was he's thinking
about it.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.571
Here.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.889
You know, Pop, honestly the only thing
I'm thinking about is the beach

06:54.960 --> 06:57.804
and what girls on the beach will
or will not be wearing this summer.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.531
- Reynolds' residence.
- Amanda Collier, please.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.568
Amanda Reynolds now,
but Amanda Collier.

07:13.640 --> 07:14.640
Yeah, you found her.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.967
Amanda,
my name is Morgan Dupree

07:17.080 --> 07:20.084
<i>and I'm the estate attorney
for Tuck Hostetler.</i>

07:21.240 --> 07:22.526
Oh, God.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.725
- Hello?
<i>- Dawson Cole, please.</i>

07:36.360 --> 07:38.124
Yeah, this is he.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.123
<i>My name is Morgan Dupree.</i>

07:40.200 --> 07:43.249
<i>I'm the estate attorney
for Tuck Hostetler.</i>

07:43.320 --> 07:46.403
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

07:46.480 --> 07:49.768
<i>Mr. Hostetler died
in his sleep last night.</i>

07:49.840 --> 07:51.569
<i>He was 92.</i>

07:52.560 --> 07:55.609
Look, I'm sorry about
your friend. I really am.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.842
But we've got stuff
going on here.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.331
I got to be at Tulane on Saturday
for the Sigma Nu thing.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.201
Monday night we've got the dinner
with the guy from Chase and his wife.

08:05.280 --> 08:09.569
Next time someone I know dies,
I'll call your secretary first.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.041
I'm sorry.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.846
Yeah.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.371
Amanda?

09:52.840 --> 09:54.080
Dawson?

09:55.360 --> 09:56.691
Hey, Amanda.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.881
Hi.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.803
Man, I'm sorry I'm all
messed up.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.889
How did you find out?

10:11.960 --> 10:15.407
I got a call from a lawyer.
Something in Tuck's will.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.403
I'm supposed to meet
with him tomorrow.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.650
- 10:00am?
- Yeah.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.404
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.330
It's been a long time.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.122
Twenty years.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.647
Well, 21, but I mean,
who's counting?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.011
You look amazing.

10:41.880 --> 10:45.680
I gotta go. I'm late.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.524
Meeting my mom.
I'm gonna meet her.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.730
- Oh, all right.
- At her house.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.564
Yeah.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.847
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.361
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

10:58.600 --> 11:00.967
- Yeah, the lawyer.
- The lawyer.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.965
It's 10:00am.
That's right. OK.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.804
Hey, Dawson.
Hey, Dawson?

11:22.400 --> 11:25.483
- Food's here.
- Thanks, April.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.689
- How you feeling?
- She was throwing up a lot.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.762
But I'm not now, so that's good.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.050
- She's so pretty.
- She sure is.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.166
You OK?

11:43.240 --> 11:47.006
It's going to be tough, but...
her parents are really good to us.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.650
They don't judge us.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.085
They just want a Bible name
for the kid.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.640
What do you
think about Aaron?

11:53.160 --> 11:55.049
I think it's better than Moses.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.646
I know it's crazy
and we're young, but...

11:58.840 --> 12:00.808
the other day when I felt
that little heartbeat...

12:01.640 --> 12:04.962
I don't know. It made
me feel happy.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.685
That's good, Bobby.
That's real good.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.084
It would just start I think...

12:15.160 --> 12:18.448
But it's not...

12:18.520 --> 12:19.851
Just try again.
Try again.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.321
- I'm sorry. Tell them I'm sorry.
- April, it's fine, OK?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.960
Put it in neutral. We'll push you
out of the way. Come on, Bobby.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.880
What's the matter?
You forget how to drive?

12:29.600 --> 12:32.001
Your dad take your
learner's permit?

12:32.080 --> 12:35.402
Come on! Move your car!

12:38.440 --> 12:40.363
You guys wanna get out
and help us push

12:40.440 --> 12:42.647
or you just gonna sit there
and keep honking?

12:42.720 --> 12:44.245
- It won't happen again.
- Yeah, sorry.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.122
Thank you. Ma'am.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.206
- Hey, we could be friends.
- What? Let's go!

12:58.280 --> 13:00.931
Will you boys grow up!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.161
Where are you going?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.604
Over to the right, April.

13:05.760 --> 13:06.807
Hi.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.205
All right. Good.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.645
OK.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.689
- Should I call a tow truck?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

13:17.760 --> 13:18.966
I'm sorry about my friends.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.202
They try to be funny but only
succeed at being idiots.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.244
- Amanda, let's go.
- Yeah, come on, let's get out of here.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.483
- OK!
- Come on!

13:27.560 --> 13:30.040
- Amanda.
- Seriously.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.969
It's all right.
You don't have to wait around.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.444
Oh. OK.

13:35.520 --> 13:39.161
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah. Anytime.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.164
Amanda! You're wasting
your time.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.361
Thank you.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.201
Later!

13:49.120 --> 13:50.690
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way

13:50.760 --> 13:54.321
'cause you're my cousin and I
love you, but you are a jackass.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.290
Did you not see the beautiful girl who
just pushed a car to try to talk to you?

13:57.360 --> 13:59.283
She was being nice, all right?
She's nice.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.927
- Yeah, she is. She's also hot.
- She is hot.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.608
Start her up.
She'll be fine now.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.126
- Thanks, Dawson.
- Go on. It's all right.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.401
See you later.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.762
I turn the key and
nothing happens.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.329
What do you think?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.880
Karmic payback for being
party to the honking?

14:58.800 --> 15:01.326
I think the universe
dispenses swift justice.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.880
He speaks.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.724
He's sort of funny.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.444
- Hey, Amanda.
- Hey.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.568
- Try it now.
- OK.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.010
Thank you.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.923
Your battery got disconnected.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.208
It's not major. It happens.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.286
All right.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.642
Are you actually
about to say something else?

15:40.680 --> 15:43.126
My cousin thinks you were trying
to talk to me the other day.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.721
I was.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.530
- He thinks I blew it.
- You did.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.723
You don't know how to flirt,
do you?

15:55.440 --> 15:56.805
Guess not.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.683
Well, what are you gonna do
about it?

16:05.960 --> 16:08.964
OK. This isn't working.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.088
OK, I'll tell you what. Uh...

16:13.200 --> 16:16.409
I want you to think about it
and, uh...

16:17.480 --> 16:22.247
...meet me at Squeals
Saturday night at 6:00... maybe?

16:23.640 --> 16:25.881
- Is that a yes?
- Yeah.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.529
OK. Maybe you'll figure out
how to flirt with me by then.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.249
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Where you runnin' off to,
Dawson?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.728
I expect you to say hello.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.761
Hello.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.561
- You're cute.
- He is cute.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.484
Looks like his daddy.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.530
Come on in here. Sit down. Let's play
a hand of cards or something.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.331
No, I'm... I got stuff to do.
I got homework.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.970
He thinks he's smarter than us.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.362
Abee, why don't you take that stupid
goddamn hat off in the house.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.970
- Yes, sir.
- Is that true?

18:07.680 --> 18:10.331
- You think you're smarter than us?
- No, sir.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.807
- You too good for this family?
- No, sir.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.441
That's good.
'Cause this is where you belong.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.200
Here.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.444
<i>Why don't you go out back
and tune up the Merc.</i>

18:23.520 --> 18:26.888
We got a delivery upriver tomorrow
night and you're going with us.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.369
I can't go tomorrow night.
I got something to do.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.200
You didn't listen to a goddamn
thing I said, did you?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.202
- I'm not...
- I'm not what?

18:50.160 --> 18:51.844
Hey, hey, come on, Pop.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.729
Let's play some cards.

18:54.480 --> 18:58.087
I swear to God, Dawson,
you are a slow fucking learner!

18:59.400 --> 19:01.368
That's a bad thing to be.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.411
You still got someplace
to be Saturday night?

19:07.160 --> 19:08.241
Yes, sir.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.449
- Hit him again, Papa.
- Ted, shut the hell up!

19:21.280 --> 19:22.930
You wanna hit me?

19:24.800 --> 19:27.167
You hit me,
you see where that'll get you.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.162
Hormones.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.208
That's what his problem is.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.920
You are either the worst car thief
in the history of the world...

21:07.000 --> 21:09.082
...or you have a story to tell.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.084
- What's your name?
- Dawson Cole.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.328
- Tommy Cole's boy?
- Yes, sir.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.371
Well, that is unfortunate.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.922
- What happened to your eye?
- I just ran into a tree.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.889
A tree with a mean right cross.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.648
You got any place to stay?
Friends? Anything like that?

21:34.840 --> 21:36.046
No, sir.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.564
Shit.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.085
Where you going?

21:54.720 --> 21:58.202
That cot over yonder ought to be
more comfortable than this car.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.241
Water out of the hose is good
to drink.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.482
If there's any trouble, anything
goes missing, anything like that,

22:05.560 --> 22:09.042
the next one to wake you up will be
a sheriff's deputy. You understand that?

22:09.120 --> 22:11.009
- Yes, sir.
- Do you understand that?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.286
Yes, sir.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.245
All right, then.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.526
Shit!

22:22.680 --> 22:24.011
Good night, Amanda.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.284
<i>♪ Little Miss, Little Miss,
Little Miss can't be wrong ♪</i>

22:34.520 --> 22:36.090
Where is he?

22:56.720 --> 22:59.451
- I decided not to come.
- Mm, yeah, I got that.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.170
I didn't know how to get a hold
of you.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.811
Oh, I was at Squeals. You could
have gotten a hold of me there.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.408
Do you live out here?

23:12.480 --> 23:14.562
Is this some kind of game
you're playing?

23:15.240 --> 23:18.847
Huh? With your friends? A little science
experiment you got going on? What is it?

23:18.920 --> 23:21.127
- That's crazy.
- That's crazy, is it?

23:21.200 --> 23:22.611
Or maybe you just like strays.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.843
Or maybe I like smart guys who
haven't had it handed to them.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.888
Right.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.202
God, you just don't get it,
do you?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.884
I guess I don't.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.888
You know, I just wanted a date.

23:41.480 --> 23:46.042
I wanted to go somewhere and maybe
have some coffee or some ice cream.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.600
Come on, you know, you ask me
questions, I ask you questions.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.887
And if we just so happen
to like the answer, Dawson,

23:50.960 --> 23:52.928
then maybe we'll go on
another one.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.048
And if we don't, then we won't.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.482
But God, I mean, if that's just
too much to ask, then fine.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.687
Forget it. I'm exhausted.
I'm done.

24:22.240 --> 24:24.607
This is why I didn't want to
go out in public.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.121
Well, then take me
somewhere private.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.922
So what're you
gonna do after high school?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.207
Uh...

24:39.760 --> 24:43.401
OK, I'll go first.
I'm going to Tulane in the fall.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.450
Double majoring in child
psychology and public policy.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.251
I'm hoping to intern
at a law firm while I'm there.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.608
And then after law school,
I'd like to work for a non-profit.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.571
Maybe in another country,
that deals with children's issues.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.001
- You wanna work with children?
- Mm-hm.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.923
You wanna have a family
of your own?

25:00.000 --> 25:03.322
Yeah, I would.
I'd like to have a little girl.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.965
Maybe name her Bea.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.370
That's a real nice name.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.562
It's really beautiful out here.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.968
I've never seen so many stars.

25:17.640 --> 25:21.406
I've always loved the stars.
I feel closer to them up here.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.447
When I was a kid,
I built my own telescope.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.683
- Wow.
- No, it's pretty easy.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.967
Yeah, for you, maybe.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.008
Humans have always
looked to the stars.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.560
Instruct their way of life,
consult them.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.408
You were gone
for a while.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.086
Yeah, my dad made me
quit school when I was 16.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.289
He said he needed me
around the home.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.284
How do you feel
about that?

25:51.600 --> 25:54.843
I don't know. I guess
I didn't like it much.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.001
It was a hell of a fight to
come back.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.649
Is it weird to be there now?

26:02.240 --> 26:03.401
Kind of.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.801
I mean, I just
wanna finish, get out.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.084
Where do you want to
go to college?

26:13.960 --> 26:15.689
Do you think everyone goes
to college?

26:15.800 --> 26:18.531
People who build
their own telescopes usually do.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.165
I don't know, it's just...

26:22.720 --> 26:24.848
it's not something I can do
right now.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.809
Is it something you want to do?

26:28.280 --> 26:30.681
- Why do you care?
- Why won't you answer?

26:32.840 --> 26:35.366
You are gonna be
a really good lawyer someday.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.522
Do you want to go,
yes or no?

26:39.680 --> 26:40.681
No.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.602
You're a bad liar.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.491
I like that.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.162
I'd like to do this
again sometime.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.441
I'd even shower and show up.
How about that?

26:55.520 --> 26:59.605
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.811
I guess I wanted to do that.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.803
I wanted to do that, too.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.291
Good to know.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.443
I wouldn't mind doing
that again.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.570
Then do it.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.122
Now first thing that Tuck
stipulated was for me to apologize

28:34.200 --> 28:36.885
on his behalf for
any inconvenience.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.851
He asked that I pass on
his gratitude

28:39.920 --> 28:44.005
for your being here
and your friendship always.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.889
His words.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.928
He would like you
to spread his ashes together,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.367
outside the cottage
of Vandemere.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.171
There is to be no funeral,

28:54.240 --> 28:57.050
no reception,
nor store-bought bouquets.

28:57.120 --> 29:00.124
Not a dime is to be
spent on frivolities.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.487
- Again...
- His words.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.289
That's right.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.728
He asks that you pack up his things
and he would like you to go through it,

29:07.800 --> 29:09.564
and take whatever you want.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.611
He left instructions that his assets
be liquidated and that the proceeds be

29:13.680 --> 29:18.163
donated to the American
Pediatric Cancer Society.

29:19.040 --> 29:23.329
The only asset not to be sold
is the cottage at Vandemere,

29:23.400 --> 29:25.846
which he left to you both.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.810
Now, typically, in situations
like this,

29:29.880 --> 29:31.644
one party will buy the
other out,

29:31.720 --> 29:35.281
unless you're interested
in joint ownership.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.130
- We're not.
- No. No.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.681
When he was in the hospital,
he wrote these. Mm-hm.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.722
Excuse me. He would
like you to read them on your own.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.447
Well, you still living
around here?

29:59.520 --> 30:01.124
- Baton Rouge.
- Yeah?

30:02.560 --> 30:05.769
- I see you got married.
- 18 years.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.763
Nice. You guys got kids?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.888
- Two.
- Boys? Girls?

30:10.400 --> 30:14.405
You know, we don't have to do this.
Ask the questions, tell our stories,

30:14.480 --> 30:16.528
pretend to want to know
about each other's lives.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.250
Well, I do want to know.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.485
We're not here for a reunion.
We're here for Tuck, so...

30:21.560 --> 30:25.246
How about this? You go to the house
today and I'll come out tomorrow.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.002
And we'll meet out at
Vandemere tomorrow afternoon.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.491
We'll say our goodbyes.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.122
- Does that work for you?
- Yeah.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.641
Bye.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.244
I'm sorry.

30:42.600 --> 30:46.002
<i>You remember that thistle problem
I had in the garden last year.</i>

30:47.120 --> 30:51.284
<i>Thistle is one tough weed.
You can't pull it or mow it.</i>

30:51.360 --> 30:53.488
<i>You have to dig it out by the root.</i>

30:53.960 --> 30:58.010
<i>While I was digging,
I got to thinking about you and Dawson.</i>

30:58.480 --> 31:01.290
<i>You have wounds that
have never healed.</i>

31:01.360 --> 31:04.364
<i>You've lived with them so long,
you don't even know they're there anymore.</i>

31:06.440 --> 31:08.329
<i>Pain has deep roots.</i>

31:09.960 --> 31:14.602
<i>The only way to dig it out is to
forgive him and forgive yourself.</i>

31:16.280 --> 31:18.680
<i>- Don't you get bored out here?
- Completely.</i>

31:18.880 --> 31:20.564
When are you gonna let me
get my hands dirty?

31:20.640 --> 31:23.166
You want
to get your hands dirty?

31:23.640 --> 31:24.926
Absolutely.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.609
What? This dirty?

31:27.680 --> 31:29.887
No. Dawson,
you're not gonna do...

31:29.960 --> 31:32.201
'Cause I'm the grease monster
from the bayou!

31:32.280 --> 31:34.123
Stop it!
Dawson! Don't!

31:34.200 --> 31:38.000
You're gonna get me all dirty,
you little punk!

31:39.120 --> 31:41.441
You gotta leave!
You gotta get out of here.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.682
- What?
- No, please, just get out of here now.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.728
- Who's that?
- Get out of here, please! Leave!

31:45.840 --> 31:47.444
- Dawson! You're hurting me!
- Leave!

31:47.520 --> 31:50.171
- Don't ask any questions. Get out! Now!
- Why do I have to go?

31:50.240 --> 31:52.322
- Go, go, go! Go, please!
- OK, Dawson.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.890
- OK.
- Go!

31:53.960 --> 31:55.121
OK!

32:02.120 --> 32:03.246
Time to come home, Dawson.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.168
You didn't introduce us
to your girlfriend.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.806
That's that Collier girl, Pop.
You know her.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.484
- Collier girl.
- Yes, sir.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.690
All right, get your stuff,
put it in the truck.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.286
- You're coming home with us.
- No, I'm not.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.331
I ain't gonna tell you again,
boy.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.042
I have had it with you, Dawson!

32:27.120 --> 32:30.283
You're all puffed up,
you're thinking that you're special.

32:30.360 --> 32:33.364
Well, let me ask you something?
Do you really believe that that girl

32:33.440 --> 32:37.764
is gonna have anything to do with
a white trash piece of shit like you?

32:38.640 --> 32:40.324
No. Come on.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.971
Get your stuff, put it
in the truck and let's go.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.524
You touch him again,
the next one will kill you.

32:52.640 --> 32:56.167
Now, I've come here for my boy
and I ain't leaving without him, so...

32:56.720 --> 32:58.563
I guess you're gonna
have to shoot me.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.206
All right.

33:03.600 --> 33:07.286
That windshield is gonna
cost you about $1,000.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.840
And those floods run about
$500 each.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.130
Do you want me to keep going?

33:20.400 --> 33:21.606
Go on now.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.765
This is nice.
What you've done here.

33:26.480 --> 33:27.891
Your wife plant these?

33:38.440 --> 33:39.521
Get in the truck, Ted.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.326
If I stay, they'll come back.

33:54.480 --> 33:58.007
I just shot up a $17,000
pick-up truck.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.969
About broke my heart to do it.

34:01.960 --> 34:04.247
They'll be back
whether you're here or not.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.925
Not safe for you to sleep out here
anymore. I'll fix you a place inside.

34:12.679 --> 34:13.966
Well, come on.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.081
Dawson...

34:46.280 --> 34:48.123
- What are you doing?
- I had to see you.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.407
- Well, come in.
- That's not a good idea.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.085
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.925
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I mean, if you're not gonna come in.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.207
- My parents think you're dangerous.
- They're right.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.886
Sooner or later, I'm gonna have
to pay for what happened today

35:04.960 --> 35:07.327
and I can't have you standing
next to me when I do, OK?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.926
- I can't have you getting hurt.
- I'm not gonna get hurt.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.968
You hang around with me
long enough and you will.

35:12.040 --> 35:15.362
I don't care! I don't care!

35:16.080 --> 35:18.731
I mean, Dawson, do you want this?
Do you want me?

35:19.320 --> 35:20.401
I do.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.721
I do.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.001
All right.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.442
- Just give me one second.
- Sure thing.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.931
You work here?

35:56.200 --> 35:59.124
No, sir. Just picking up
some stuff for my uncles.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.002
You look a lot like
an old friend of mine.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.166
- People tell me I look like my dad.
- Yeah?

36:07.120 --> 36:08.326
Bobby Cole?

36:09.680 --> 36:10.806
You knew him?

36:11.600 --> 36:14.444
Goddamn it, Aaron. How many
times I gotta tell you that you...

36:15.920 --> 36:18.048
Well, as I live and breathe.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.441
Man 2: The Prodigal Son returns.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.922
You might wanna stay away from
that shit. Good talking to you.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.202
It's been a long time,
Dawson!

36:27.640 --> 36:28.926
About 20 years?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.401
Thank you.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.361
Thank you.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.967
- You know who that is, Aaron?
- That's Dawson Cole.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.125
I thought maybe you'd
need a hand.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.525
Hey. I thought you might
want this.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.890
You can take it.

37:38.960 --> 37:41.486
I just didn't want to pack things away
if you might want to keep 'em.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.962
It's OK. I don't want much.
I'll make my own box.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.041
OK.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.203
- What? What is it?
- Nothing.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.250
Is there something you
want to say?

37:55.320 --> 37:56.810
No.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.041
I guess I just want to know
if you're happy.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.806
You want facts?

38:05.400 --> 38:09.530
I... went to Tulane, as planned.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.608
Got pregnant sophomore year,
not planned.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.803
Got married, moved to Baton Rouge.
Bought a house.

38:17.880 --> 38:21.726
Had another baby. Did some volunteer
work. Bought a bigger house.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.641
Law school?

38:25.680 --> 38:27.728
I didn't finish college.

38:28.720 --> 38:34.204
I had so many plans
and I don't know what happened.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.520
Life?

38:36.800 --> 38:39.041
I guess. Anyway.

38:40.040 --> 38:43.567
Am I happy?
Being a mother makes me happy.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.723
Look what I found.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.441
Oh, wow.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.330
I forgot he had this.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.730
She's a real beauty.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.966
Thanks.

39:33.920 --> 39:37.447
So if you're not going to college,
then why do you study so much?

39:37.560 --> 39:40.769
Oh, wait, I know why.
Because you are going to college.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.446
You'll definitely get in.
You'll probably get a scholarship.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.761
- Grab the stuff from the back, please?
- I got it.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.125
All right, these are
applications.

39:49.240 --> 39:52.360
- I know what they are. I've seen them.
- All right. Well, get started on them.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.290
- There's a problem.
- Already? You haven't even started yet.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.441
They want a home address.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.690
You live with Tuck.
Why don't you ask him?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.569
- No, don't ask Tuck, please.
- Why?

40:01.640 --> 40:05.770
He's private. He won't like you snooping
around and stuff... Amanda!

40:05.880 --> 40:07.086
- OK!
- Amanda.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.410
- Tuck?
- In here.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.849
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

40:13.920 --> 40:16.366
Wow, you look handsome.
Here, I got you these.

40:16.440 --> 40:19.364
They're chocolate covered pralines.
I hope you like them.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.364
- Can I ask you a couple questions?
- OK.

40:22.480 --> 40:26.371
- Do you have an onion?
- I do.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.329
Good. 'Cause we forgot one.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.370
Second thing, we were just going over
Dawson's college applications

40:31.440 --> 40:34.410
and we were wondering, can we use
your address as his home address?

40:35.760 --> 40:38.411
- That'll be fine.
- Great.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.961
Let's get cooking.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.124
- Maybe you should set the table.
- Maybe I should set the table.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.243
Wow, those are beautiful.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.927
Yeah, they came in real good this year.
It was a wet spring.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.365
- These are my wife's favorite.
- Oh, yeah?

41:04.280 --> 41:05.850
How long were y'all married?

41:06.440 --> 41:10.365
We're still married.
We're just on different schedules.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.643
She had a stroke
four years ago this May.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.245
I'm sorry.

41:17.320 --> 41:20.563
There's still times that
I'll step outside there at night

41:20.640 --> 41:22.404
and have a little chat
with Clara.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.121
Ain't that foolish?

41:27.920 --> 41:31.606
<i>All I'm saying is when two cars
break down on consecutive days,</i>

41:31.680 --> 41:34.763
that bring two people together
that fall in love, that's destiny.

41:34.840 --> 41:38.367
Destiny? No, Destiny is the name
the fortunate give to their fortunes.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.680
What is that supposed to mean?

41:39.760 --> 41:42.331
That means that people
never call bad things destiny.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.482
You are absolutely impossible.
Why can't you just agree

41:44.560 --> 41:46.289
with anything that I have
to say, Dawson? Why?

41:46.360 --> 41:49.648
- Tuck, please help me out here.
- Come on, Tuck.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.324
- What?
- What do you think?

41:51.400 --> 41:54.165
I never did believe
in any of that stuff.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.442
But I will tell you one
thing now.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.566
Uh, back in the war,

42:02.640 --> 42:06.167
I was in the Navy,
I'm serving aboard a destroyer.

42:07.040 --> 42:12.251
And at the Leyte Gulf, we...
we took a Jap torpedo.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.926
Blew me right off the deck.
Broke my back.

42:16.280 --> 42:20.171
There I am bobbing around in
the water like a fishing cork,

42:20.240 --> 42:23.847
all hell breaking loose
all around me and l...

42:23.920 --> 42:25.365
I started singing.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.523
This old Irving Berlin song.

42:29.600 --> 42:34.367
<i>What'll I do with just a photograph
to tell my troubles to?</i>

42:34.440 --> 42:36.647
<i>What'll I do? What'll I do?</i>

42:38.560 --> 42:40.050
<i>What'll I do?</i>

42:40.160 --> 42:43.562
Well, after a few verses of this,

42:43.640 --> 42:46.849
this calm just, poof,

42:46.960 --> 42:51.363
came over me and I knew right
then I was gonna be all right.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.330
That I was gonna go home,
that I was gonna...

42:58.320 --> 43:00.561
I was gonna hold my wife again.

43:03.680 --> 43:08.481
Well, a few years pass by, we built
that little cottage at Vandemere and...

43:09.680 --> 43:13.685
...I walked outside one day and Clara
was out there in the garden singing...

43:15.280 --> 43:17.362
<i>What'll I do?</i>

43:21.080 --> 43:24.641
Now, she saw the look on my face
and so I told her the story.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.324
And then she told me hers.

43:29.160 --> 43:32.323
It seems like right about that
same time, she'd had a dream.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.842
A dream where I was
singing to her.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.524
And you care to take a guess
at the name of the song?

43:41.560 --> 43:43.369
Come on. Get out of here, Tuck.

43:43.440 --> 43:47.570
Well, now, I don't know exactly
what you'd call that, but

43:47.640 --> 43:50.564
whatever you call it,
it got me home.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.645
Would you dance with me?

44:01.480 --> 44:03.448
- You can dance?
- No.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.126
But I figured you'd make me
learn sooner or later.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.809
I guess you have a good point.

44:16.160 --> 44:18.561
- Now, don't step on my feet.
- I'll try not to.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.485
Hey, look at me.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.321
Dawson?

45:12.720 --> 45:14.131
I'd like to talk to you.

45:16.200 --> 45:19.602
Four years after Jared was born,
Frank and I had another child.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.761
A wonderful little girl.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.802
She was so full of joy.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.371
Tuck loved her.

45:31.440 --> 45:34.011
"She shines with her own light,"
he said.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.051
He was right about that.

45:39.720 --> 45:43.805
She was diagnosed with leukemia a few
weeks after that picture was taken.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.051
She'd just turned two.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.171
And I remember that day.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.170
You know, it was just a day.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.011
And you want so much
to go back to just a

46:02.080 --> 46:04.401
not-so-special day like that,
you know.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.280
But you never can.

46:10.360 --> 46:14.410
I can't imagine how difficult
that must have been for your family.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.568
We both started drinking
too much.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.529
I quit. He never did.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.806
I wish I'd have been
there for you.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.400
Yeah.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.290
That didn't happen.

46:34.640 --> 46:35.801
That's life.

46:39.400 --> 46:40.481
What was her name?

46:42.440 --> 46:45.330
Bea. Her name was Bea.

46:46.880 --> 46:48.564
Bea.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.162
You've gotten better at that.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.811
Yeah, 20 years later,
I can chop an onion.

46:59.520 --> 47:00.681
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

47:02.760 --> 47:05.604
I bet you're the smartest guy
on the rig, huh?

47:05.680 --> 47:07.170
Well, of course I am.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.041
Yeah, you know, I got pretty good
at computer, actually,

47:12.120 --> 47:14.122
and the boss wanted me
to go back to school,

47:14.200 --> 47:17.124
get certified as an
IT specialist.

47:17.880 --> 47:20.451
And let me guess.
You don't want to do that.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.923
- I like my job.
- But you might like the new one more.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.889
I don't know why you don't
go to college and get the piece...

47:26.960 --> 47:28.086
Piece of paper.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.686
- Well, I don't.
- Yeah, that's her.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.924
That's the girl who
just wouldn't let me settle.

47:38.200 --> 47:41.841
Yeah, well, I haven't
seen much of her lately, so...

47:43.440 --> 47:44.851
Yeah, but there she is.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.324
To her.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.561
<i>Does it ever
get lonely out there?</i>

47:58.640 --> 48:00.688
I mean,
are you asking me if I'm single?

48:01.680 --> 48:02.886
Are you?

48:09.080 --> 48:13.290
Well, I've had, you know,
relationships, I guess.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.011
And things...

48:17.320 --> 48:21.211
I mean, nothing...
Yeah, no, not right now.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.805
You ever been in love?

48:25.480 --> 48:26.766
With you.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.722
<i>That was 20 years ago.</i>

48:30.800 --> 48:31.847
Twenty-one.

48:34.520 --> 48:38.445
Well, what do you want me to say,
you set a high bar.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.130
Seriously?

48:41.320 --> 48:43.527
Are you saying that
I'm the reason that you're alone?

48:43.600 --> 48:45.648
Don't ask questions
if you don't want any answers.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.245
That's ridiculous.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.722
I mean, honest to God.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.170
What? Why are you laughing?

48:57.240 --> 48:58.730
I don't know. I guess I just...

49:00.560 --> 49:05.122
I miss this.
I miss... you getting all mad at me.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.123
I'm not mad.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.531
You're being a little pushy.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.965
I'm not pushy.

49:10.040 --> 49:11.644
You just care so much, Amanda.

49:13.160 --> 49:14.764
You just can't help yourself.

49:18.760 --> 49:19.966
I should go.

49:21.240 --> 49:24.767
- What?
- This is dangerous.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.931
We've had wine...

49:27.680 --> 49:32.811
...and somehow you have gotten
better looking, which is so annoying.

49:32.880 --> 49:36.487
Couldn't you have gotten bald
or fat or something? Jesus!

49:37.560 --> 49:41.485
You know, it seems a little silly to
take two cars to Vandemere tomorrow.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.689
I have a confession to make.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.407
OK.

49:49.480 --> 49:52.689
It wasn't destiny when
my car broke down at school.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.082
I disconnected the battery myself
so you could save me.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.643
- I know.
- What?

50:01.720 --> 50:04.120
I know. I knew the minute I saw
your battery line yanked out.

50:04.160 --> 50:07.562
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you tell me?

50:08.880 --> 50:11.611
How often is the mechanic
the hero of the story?

51:14.960 --> 51:18.282
<i>Oh, I gotta go to Vandemere.
Tuck's been putting it off for weeks.</i>

51:18.360 --> 51:21.409
<i>Now his back's out,
he's worried about the garden.</i>

51:21.480 --> 51:23.164
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.969
You go take care of
Tuck's garden.

51:25.600 --> 51:27.682
<i>He needs you. I just want you.</i>

51:27.760 --> 51:30.206
- Maybe next weekend.
- Can't wait.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.725
- Be good.
- I will.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.804
- Don't wreck.
- I won't.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.847
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.048
I love you.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.805
All right.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.969
I told you I couldn't wait.

That was for not answering.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.805
That was for disrespect.

56:52.560 --> 56:54.244
I don't remember what
that was for.

56:59.680 --> 57:00.727
Hey.

57:02.760 --> 57:06.651
It's OK. They don't
hurt anymore.

57:19.600 --> 57:20.840
We need a song.

57:21.840 --> 57:24.207
In case one of us
gets deployed in World War lll?

57:24.280 --> 57:26.044
No, I'm serious.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.844
Something we can keep forever.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.450
Then pick one.

57:31.520 --> 57:33.761
There's nothing romantic
about picking one.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.201
Here.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.204
First song that comes on
clearly.

57:43.040 --> 57:46.203
We're in the middle of nowhere.
You're not gonna get anything.

57:47.400 --> 57:51.041
Even if you do get something, it's gonna
be a public broadcast on fly fishing.

57:58.720 --> 58:01.769
- Why are you always right?
- I guess it's just a gift.

58:09.280 --> 58:11.886
- Look at you.
- I've been practicing.

58:12.480 --> 58:15.324
- With who?
- Tuck.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.807
<i>♪ Sweet Jane... ♪</i>

58:56.040 --> 58:57.849
Dawson!

59:00.880 --> 59:05.442
So, Dawson, tell me,
what are your plans for the future?

59:05.560 --> 59:07.164
Well, I hope to go to
college next year, sir.

59:07.240 --> 59:12.007
He is going to college.
He got a 4.0 and 1520 on his SATs.

59:12.080 --> 59:14.765
Well, that's good, son.
Where did you apply?

59:14.840 --> 59:18.242
I applied to Tulane,
Loyola and LSU.

59:18.320 --> 59:21.563
I mean, I'll probably end up at LSU.
It's the most realistic.

59:21.640 --> 59:23.244
Yeah, and it's not too far
from New Orleans,

59:23.320 --> 59:25.163
that way we could
still see each other, right?

59:25.240 --> 59:27.322
I take it you know
a few things about cars.

59:27.400 --> 59:31.086
- Yeah, a little, I guess.
- I got a bunch of them in the back.

59:31.160 --> 59:33.242
Yeah, Amanda said you
have a collection.

59:34.240 --> 59:36.561
- How many cars you own?
- Too many.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.084
A few. Would you like to
see them?

59:40.160 --> 59:44.051
- Recognize that one?
- It's a '71 Oldsmobile 442.

59:44.120 --> 59:45.849
You know why they call it that?

59:45.920 --> 59:49.129
Yeah, a four barrel carb,
four speed gear box, dual exhaust.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.010
It's a beautiful car, sir.

59:52.080 --> 59:55.004
Smart boy. I can see why she
likes you.

59:55.080 --> 59:58.641
Go on. Take a look underneath.
Yeah. I know you want to.

59:58.720 --> 59:59.926
I'd love to.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.331
Wow.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.768
Say, have you given any thought
to how you'll pay for college?

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.607
There's... There's scholarships,
financial aid, loans, stuff like that.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.526
Tuition's a killer. And you need money
for books, room and board.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.241
It's expensive.
It can be prohibitive for kids like you.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.926
"Kids like me?"

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.005
You're a nice guy, Dawson.
I'd like to help you, if you'll let me.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.361
Well, how's that, sir?

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.166
Well... four years of school,
say...

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.802
$15,000 a year for tuition.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.043
Another five to live
comfortably.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.644
You want to give me $80,000?

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.165
If you'll let me.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.324
Just stay away from Amanda,
right?

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.369
You'll come out debt-free.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.321
With a real chance
to make something of yourself.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.164
This isn't personal, son.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.569
I just want what's best
for my daughter,

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.405
and I can't have her
anywhere near your family.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.124
It's gonna end anyway.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.607
This way, you get something out
of it.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.884
- I don't want your money.
- What's that?

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.531
- I don't want your money.
- You think about it.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.720
I don't have to.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.081
You know what you can do
with that 80 grand, sir?

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.005
Shove it up your ass.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.320
You think about it.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.366
I'm sorry.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.764
My dad's an asshole.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.411
He's right,
though.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.804
You got a big life ahead of you.
You're gonna do great things.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.762
I don't want to get in the way
of that.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.723
Dawson, what would you risk for
me?

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.920
Everything.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.047
Then let me love you like that.
Please.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.968
OK. OK.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.324
How much did he offer?

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.164
There's not enough money
in the world.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.720
Well, I mean, if he was gonna throw in
that Cobra, I'd have to think about it.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.524
You're so mean.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.562
<i>- Nice car.
- Tuck's policy.</i>

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.847
All rebuilds
must be test driven...

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.365
Before they're returned.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.680
Are you gonna
let me drive?

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.444
- You learned how to drive a stick?
- Yes.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.366
- Really?
- Kind of.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.331
- All right.
- All right.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.648
- Kind of?
- Mm-hm.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.165
God help me.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.084
All right. Easy on the clutch. Easy.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.203
All right. Go to first gear. Up.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.370
There we go. Now, slow.
Slowly let the clutch out.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.807
- OK, there you go. Slow down!
- Whooo!

I just... this is how
we're supposed to do this?

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.362
I mean, yeah, I don't know.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.647
This is where he
scattered Clara's ashes, so...

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.291
- Right.
- Seems all right to me.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.171
Well, we should say something.
Not like a...

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.607
...a long winded eulogy
or anything like that. Just...

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.445
- No, no, he'd hate that.
- Right. No fuss.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.410
- No.
- OK.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.331
We love you.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.686
We do.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.127
Oh! Oh, shit. Oh!

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.445
- Just scatter it.
- Yeah?

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.601
Yeah, just...

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.845
Oh! OK. Well, maybe we throw it.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.647
- That was much better.
- Yeah. OK. Here.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.843
- To Tuck.
- To Tuck.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.001
- Sure you don't want another one?
- No. Nah, I'd better not.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.362
- When are you going home?
- Tomorrow.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.846
Last time I was out,
there was this explosion.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.487
Wait, that was your rig?
You were on it?

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.722
Yeah, I fell 100 feet into
the water.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.244
I still have no idea why I
didn't drown.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.130
I wasn't wearing a vest.
Doctors couldn't figure it out either.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.285
- God, you were lucky.
- Maybe.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.527
I saw you.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.801
I had, like, a...

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.726
It wasn't a dream.
You were there with me.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.640
And it was strange 'cause
I hadn't seen you in so long.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.763
And then I get out of the hospital
and I get this call about Tuck.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.530
Then I come here and
I see you.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.161
And it's like...

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.366
I don't know. Just strange.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.005
I'm glad you're OK.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.491
What are you gonna do,
Amanda?

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.601
What do you mean?

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.090
If you're unhappy.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.967
Wait.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.091
You got all this advice
for me, you know?

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.006
What are you gonna do?

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.248
You know what this feels like
to me?

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.449
Fate. That's what it feels like
to me.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.087
I'm trying to get my head around it
since it all happened.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.642
Why the hell am I still here?
And maybe it's 'cause of this, you know?

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.281
Maybe it's a chance
to see you again and...

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.764
a chance to tell you how sorry
I am.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.402
And tell you how much I still
love you.

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:19.448
You want me to fall back
in love with you?

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.640
How do I do that
if I haven't ever stopped?

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:32.845
- Tuck?
- Yeah.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.642
I... I got you something.
It's not much at all, but...

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:41.920
...I didn't want you to have to worry
about a dry spring anymore.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.040
Yeah.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.444
She'll need one of these.

01:08:51.479 --> 01:08:53.608
Tuck, no one's ever treated me
like you have.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.966
No one's ever shown me

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.566
- this kind of dignity and respect.
- Your tie is crooked.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.439
- How about a smile, Tuck?
- This is a smile.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:54.811
Oh, shoot.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.801
Whoo!

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.006
Get down there!
Get on down there!

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.762
- Come on, g-up, mule.
- Smile pretty.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.691
Oh, oh. Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.402
Wake up, you gotta wake up.
I want you to see this.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.684
Now, look at that.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.491
- There it go! There goes the squash.
- Whoo!

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.644
Just about ready to pick.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.085
Let me ask you something.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.160
Those pretty tulips right there,
all those flowers.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.281
Not the tulips.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.011
Did you and your wife plant those?

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.323
Come on, you get a good look.
Get a good look.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.207
Hey, I forgot Amanda's flower thing.
Can we turn around?

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.123
- Oh, yeah, it's just right there.
- Yeah.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.124
Mayhall can't even tie his shoe.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.242
It's Tuck! Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Get out, get out!

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.804
Tuck! Tuck!

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.888
Call 911! Go, now!

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.129
Bobby, you go help!
Go help, go help, go help!

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.482
Tuck! Tuck, what happened?

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.929
I ran into a tree.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.530
Bobby, you stay with him.
You help him.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.281
Tuck.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.846
Someone's on their way, Tuck.
OK? You're gonna be OK.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.370
- Dawson! What are you gonna do?
- Go on, stop him now.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.201
- Dawson, don't do this!
- Just talk to me!

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.526
Give me the gun.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.204
- Just give him the gun, Dawson!
- Get out of the truck, Bobby.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.169
Don't do this. It's what
he wants.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.049
- Get out of the truck, Bobby!
- No!

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.647
- Bobby! No!
- Stay with Tuck. Stay here with Tuck.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.643
- It's gonna be OK.
- Bobby!

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.721
Dawson.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.725
- Bobby!
- Stay here.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.489
Cool down, cool down,
cool down!

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.401
Just think!

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.926
Dawson, come on.
Turn the car around. Come on!

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.321
Stop! This is stupid.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.325
Dawson, you don't want
to do this.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.890
Told you he'd come back.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.530
- Stay back, Bobby.
- Dawson.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.971
- Stay there!
- Uh-oh.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.601
You know, the last person
that pointed that rifle at me,

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.284
he had an accident.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.686
He tripped down his
wheelchair ramp.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.806
Look at him.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.882
Look at you,
you're all dressed to kill.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.247
Is that what you are?
You're a killer now?

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.641
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill all three of us?

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.326
No. Just you.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.682
Why don't you go on and
do it then?

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.127
- Put down the gun, Dawson!
- Oh, he will.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.528
Don't worry, Bobby.
I know this one.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.451
He ain't no killer.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.562
You're not a killer, son. Here.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.851
You ain't nothing.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.089
- Hell, no.
- Ted! Hey, Ted!

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.731
Get up!

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.040
Get up!

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.767
I gotta tell ya.
I didn't see that coming.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.201
Yeah, Papa!

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.206
Come on, hit him!

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.891
Get up, Papa!

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.610
You got this.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.361
Dawson, that's enough!
You're gonna kill him. Come on!

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.645
Come on, Dawson.

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.167
Dawson, look out!

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.565
Bobby. Bobby!

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.931
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, no, no.
Bob, Bob, look at me, look at me.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.331
Look at me, Bobby!

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.051
Bobby...

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.602
I'm so sorry!

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.524
<i>Bobby was getting out.</i>

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.124
<i>He was gonna be a dad.</i>

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.807
<i>Tuck, he was gonna be
such a good dad.</i>

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.882
<i>He's the only family I ever had.</i>

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.406
Look at me, son.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.084
I said look at me.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.049
The DA doesn't want you.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.564
He wants Tommy.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.328
If you help them,
then they will help you.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.925
I killed him, Tuck.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.164
I deserve to be here.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.402
Yeah, you showed up there
with a loaded gun

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.926
and...

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.930
...you're gonna have to
do some time for that.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.368
But, son, there is a reason
that you are here.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.522
You have a life to live.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.207
And you're gonna fight back and
you're gonna keep fighting back.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.604
'Cause no matter what you think,
you are not just your father's son.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.208
Dawson, you are not
like them other boys.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.328
You're a good boy.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.408
And you're
my boy.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.767
You hear me?

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.649
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.965
Yes, sir.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.049
<i>This is the DEA.
We have the house surrounded.</i>

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.210
Ted!

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.124
Do you see any of those individuals
present in the courtroom at this time?

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.326
I do.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.131
Can you point out
Abee Cole at this time?

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.203
Can you also point out
Theodore "Ted" Cole at this time?

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.406
Yes.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.885
Can you also point out Thomas
"Tommy" Cole at this time, please?

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.284
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.804
I brought you some books
and things.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.721
Thanks.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.530
You just let me know if I need
to bring anything else for you

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.523
and I'll bring it next time,
all right?

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.047
- There can't be a next time.
- What do you mean?

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.524
I got eight years.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.210
I mean, it's, what, four before
I'm even eligible for parole?

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.123
- I'll wait.
- No.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.009
No, I can't let you do that.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.642
You don't get to make
that choice.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.200
If this was the last time
you're gonna see me...

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.851
...what would you say?
- Please don't do this.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.925
I'd say thank you.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.402
- I'm not walking away.
- I'd say I love you.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.370
- Dawson.
- I always will.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.647
Dawson, please don't do this.
Please.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.688
I love you.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.041
Wait, Dawson! Dawson!

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.446
Dawson! Dawson!

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.125
- Ma'am, I need you to come with me.
- OK.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.770
- OK.
- Please.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.643
- Oh, God.
- Please come with me. Come with me.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.971
- Right this way.
- OK.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.400
Thank you.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.690
Excuse me.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.491
<i>Brentwood,
please come to the front.</i>

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.767
He's not taking any visitors.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.644
Collier.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.247
I'm sorry, Miss Collier.
He doesn't want to see you.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.406
OK.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.723
- Man. Back again, huh?
- Yeah.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.531
<i>I went every day for a
month,</i>

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.807
and then every week for a year.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.964
Did they tell you that I came?

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.565
They told me.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.324
I guess maybe I hoped
they didn't.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.324
Do you even know that I went
when Frank and I started dating?

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.000
I told him I was going
to see my parents.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.371
They told me every time.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.120
- And you didn't want to see me?
- That's the only thing I did want.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.162
I never stopped loving you,
Amanda. Not once.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.163
- Then why didn't you?!
- Because I...

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.163
- I know this doesn't make sense...
- It doesn't.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.402
All right, Amanda. Listen to me.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.882
I wanted to do something good.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.368
And I wanted to save you
from some of the pain.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.249
You didn't save me
from anything.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.210
I lived with the pain every day
of my life, Dawson, and I blame you.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.567
I blame you for thinking you knew
what was best for me

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.008
- when it was you that was best for me.
- I know.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.162
I couldn't have you
wait for me.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.403
- There was so much you wanted to do.
- But I wanted to do it with you.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.642
And I would have waited
for as long as it took.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:51.849
- I didn't deserve you, Amanda.
- Oh, deserve me?

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.328
Jesus, Dawson.
Don't you understand?

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.368
When I had Jared,
and I know this is wrong,

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.001
but do you know that when I had him
I wanted to tell you.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:09.081
And when I lost Bea...
I wanted you to hold me.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.769
And when I was alone
at night, I wanted...

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.883
I wanted you and I cried for you

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.804
and I hated you
and I hated you because...

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.882
because I would have chosen you
no matter what,

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.088
and you took that away from me.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.563
- I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.486
I did. I hurt you.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.563
But see, I still love you.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.284
I still love you.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.644
<i>Do you remember
the last time we</i>

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.768
<i>were here and I turned
on the radio?</i>

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.045
- <i>"Sweet Jane."</i>
- Yeah.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.205
God, I knew a song
would come in and then it did.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.089
- Clear as day.
- I know.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.007
As if it was cued up for us.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.367
You know, I used to feel that
way about everything.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.247
I'd just blindly trust
in life to work out.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.125
And then it would.

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.368
I don't feel that way anymore.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.080
What?

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.851
Where you going?

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.680
Anymore, I don't like
to leave things to chance.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.321
Wow.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.571
You're not stepping on
my feet anymore.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.971
Well, not yet.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.961
Would you do one thing for me?

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.769
Would you forgive yourself?

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.083
You're a good man, Dawson.
Believe it.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.124
That shirt looks a lot better
on you.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.563
It's so cold.
Do you remember it being so cold?

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.165
Nah, don't be a baby.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:43.205
- I'm not a baby.
- Come here.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.126
Lie back.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.567
- Happy?
- Yeah.

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.922
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.201
Hi, Jared. Yeah, I'm doing OK.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.326
How are you?

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.484
Are his parents going?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.040
I just don't want you to get in the car,
you know, if anyone's been drinking.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.841
I know, but Mike can
barely drive if he's sober.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.604
All right, well,
just ask your dad.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.365
I miss you, too.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.283
All right, I'll see you
in a couple of days.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:13.328
OK, be careful. Bye.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.080
- Sorry. It's Jared.
- It's OK.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.163
We can't do this, can we?

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.485
I know you, Amanda.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.331
I know your heart.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.849
You're the girl who came every day
for a month and every week for a year.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.805
You have a husband.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.127
And you have a son
that you love very much.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.728
You won't give up easy.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.121
These past few days
have been so good.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.491
A chance to see you
and to talk to you.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.604
To heal a little.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.124
To love you again.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.523
People spend their whole life looking
for that and they never find it.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.886
But we did.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.529
We're the lucky ones.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.130
No matter what happens, Amanda,
I want you to know

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.929
how grateful I am.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.649
'Cause at the end of it all...

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.970
...I get to say I know what it's like
to have loved someone.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.161
Truly love someone
because I've loved you.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.088
I have to go back.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.326
And I don't know how
I'm gonna say goodbye to you.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.530
I'll always be here.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.044
And I'll always love you.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.688
I'm gonna trust in the stars.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.120
Hello?

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.687
Hey. I'm home.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.561
- You just get back?
- I did.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.605
How was it?

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.566
Nice... Sad.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.411
How's your mom?

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.446
She missed us at Easter.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.681
- It's a busy time of year.
- I said.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.291
- I got to, uh...
- I'll get dinner started.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.001
Wow.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.805
Cheers.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.006
Sorry.

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.610
Hello, Chas.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.845
Uh-huh. Right, pal. No.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.764
Brooksie already told me
you shot eight over par, so...

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.321
Eat.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.765
...you're busted.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.209
What the hell
are you doing out there, man?

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.328
I saw you hacking away like it
was a...

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.250
Oh, yeah, OK, no.
Blame it on the partner, that's good.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.846
Is that what you said about me
last week, you son of a bitch?

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.491
<i>Dawson, over the years
I've come to know Amanda pretty well.</i>

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.570
<i>She's got a lot of good
inside her.</i>

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.449
<i>A lot of pain, too...</i>

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.360
<i>...about the past, about you.</i>

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:04.522
<i>I got you together here because I don't
want either of you living with regret.</i>

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.085
<i>You two were meant to
love each other.</i>

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.084
<i>You needed a chance to
remember that.</i>

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.927
<i>I'm not saying you're gonna be
together. I don't know that.</i>

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.363
<i>And if it doesn't work out,
you'll miss her so much</i>

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.647
<i>you'll barely be able to move.</i>

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.924
<i>You'll feel you have
no purpose...</i>

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.203
<i>...no reason to go on.</i>

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.247
<i>But there's nothing to do
but wait.</i>

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.527
<i>Wait and it'll get clear to you.</i>

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.046
<i>You'll get on with your life
and gifts will come into it.</i>

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.361
<i>I was lost when Clara died.</i>

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:51.681
<i>Then one day this kid
walks into my garage.</i>

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.650
<i>I want you to know the gift you
were to me. I thank you for it.</i>

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.445
I knew you were back.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.288
I saw the flowers on
Bobby's grave.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.921
I haven't had a chance
to do that in a while, April.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.362
We've been getting the money.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.244
You don't have to send that.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.044
You don't owe us anything.

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.409
How'd you know it was me?

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.051
Who else would it be?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.890
Who else would send cash
through the mail?

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.926
I figured if I wrote you a check with
my name on it, you wouldn't cash it.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.523
We told him to get out
of the truck.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.322
We both did.
It wasn't your fault.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.289
It's just something that
lives in my head, you know?

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:43.848
I play it over and over.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.851
Look at me. Look at me!

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.848
Dawson, you didn't kill him.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.651
They killed him.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.688
And now it's Aaron.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.410
What do you mean?

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:06.280
Ted and Abee started coming around
when he was about 14.

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:09.364
They took him out. Eased him in.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.564
<i>You know, girls and cars
and booze</i> and...

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.210
<i>So he's been
hanging around out there?</i>

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.442
<i>All the time.</i>

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.888
<i>He didn't get in any real trouble until
your father took him under his wing.</i>

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.325
<i>And how he's running errands for them
and making deliveries.</i>

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.409
<i>He's a good kid.
He's not like them.</i>

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.010
<i>He's like his dad.</i>

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.210
<i>He just doesn't know it.</i>

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.811
What are you doing here?

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.762
Aaron. I want you to
come with me.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.966
Why the hell would I do that?

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.646
Dawson.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.801
They told me you were here.
What a surprise.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.763
It's not even my birthday.

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:04.051
What line of bullshit
is he feeding you, son?

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:10.728
He lives here now, with family.

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.204
This is no family. It never was.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.169
Well, not to you, maybe.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.883
But you never figured that blood
counted for much, did you?

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.204
I'll tell you what I do know.

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.561
There was never an ounce
of love in this house.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.847
Oh... love.

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.491
You're a weak piece of shit, Dawson.
You know that?

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.484
You always were, you always
will be.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.927
- I'm weak?
- Mm.

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.441
You were my father and you
treated me like an animal.

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.761
I tried to make a man
out of you.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.685
But you didn't appreciate
a goddamn thing I gave you.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.643
And what did you give me?

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.241
These?

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.724
You are weak.
And you're not worth it.

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.442
And I'm not gonna let you
ruin another person's life

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.760
like you tried to ruin mine.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.481
I'm taking the boy, if he'll go.

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:10.529
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me,

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.444
because you're just a scared
old man

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.568
who doesn't want to go
back to prison.

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.405
Don't get in my way.

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.446
It's all right.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.530
Amanda!

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.561
Yes?

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.805
I didn't know you were there.
Did you see my golf glove?

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.688
- Can I talk to you?
- Nothing is where I left it.

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.888
- Jesus, Frank.
- What?

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.890
What do you want to talk about?

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.125
Us.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.124
Come on, Amanda, I'm 20 minutes
late for my tee time with Hal.

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.804
I can't do marriage counseling.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.161
- I've lied to you, Frank.
- About what?

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:11.330
For a long time I have lied.
But I want to tell you the truth.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.966
OK.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.407
I saw someone this weekend.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.244
Someone I fell in love with
a long time ago.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.844
What, you mean, the guy,
the kid...

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.206
- Dawson.
- Cole?

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.647
- Yes.
- Yeah?

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.169
I'm still in love with him.

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.089
I didn't know I was going to see him.
I didn't expect to.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:42.767
But I'm glad I did because it made me
realize how completely lost

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.729
- I have been.
- You sound a little crazy.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.802
I don't expect you
to understand.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.764
When I lost him,
I lost who I was.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.249
- Right.
- I lied to you, Frank.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.482
I have lied to you
and I have lied to myself.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.649
And I've tried to
make it work. We both have.

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.609
But I can't do it anymore.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:06.048
So what? You want me to stop drinking?
Is that what you want?

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.885
What I want is to stop sleepwalking
through my life.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.644
Then stop!

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.929
I mean, just listen to yourself.
Get over it.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.923
No.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.810
Look, this is my life, too.
You don't just get to choose.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.247
Yes, I do.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.164
And I am done pretending.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.531
OK. Good.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:37.369
- What are you doing?
- Does it matter?

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.205
<i>Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.</i>

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.325
I was hoping maybe we
could talk.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.880
A lot of things have changed
since I last saw you.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:24.370
<i>And well, I just...
I want to say I love you.</i>

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.569
I do, Dawson.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.090
<i>And I always have.</i>

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.602
<i>All right, call me if you
have a moment.</i>

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:43.961
Hello?

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.329
Yes, this is his mother.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.683
Frank, it's the fourth time I've called.
Jared's at Delta West.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.888
I need you to come
as soon as you get this.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:07.491
Mrs. Reynolds?

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.801
- How's my son?
- Post-op.

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.486
We went in, had a look around.
He's stable for now.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.370
- All right, what happened?
- His car hit a tree,

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.124
- he was thrown from the vehicle.
- Oh, my God.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:20.483
The blunt trauma from the accident has
resulted in serious damage to his heart.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.403
- What does that mean?
- Amanda!

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.008
- Sorry. I was...
- Wait, Frank.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.326
What's happened?

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.641
- Frank, just listen!
- What's going on? Where's my son?

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.251
It means one of the valves
of his heart is torn.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.641
<i>It's my determination
that we can't repair it.</i>

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.324
<i>What does that mean,
exactly?</i>

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.130
<i>He needs a transplant
and very soon.</i>

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.962
<i>Doctor, I have lost one
child already. I cannot lose another.</i>

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.605
<i>I understand.</i>

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.886
<i>Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.</i>

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.366
<i>I was hoping maybe we
could talk.</i>

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.841
<i>A lot of things have changed
since I last saw you.</i>

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.449
<i>I wanted to say I love you.</i>

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.125
<i>I do, Dawson.</i>

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.321
Come on!

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.486
Abee! Abee!

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:52.921
Ted!

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.283
Oh, hell! Where is he?

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.449
What's going on? What happened?

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:25.444
They're prepping him for surgery.
They found a heart.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.529
He's got a chance now.

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.770
Amanda.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.321
Dawson.

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.167
What are you doing here?

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.484
Mom. I overslept.
I gotta get back to the hospital.

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.245
Jared's all right, sweetheart.
I just spoke with Frank.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.601
All right. Let me get dressed.
You'll come with me, right?

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.880
Jared will want to see you.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.931
Amanda.

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.805
Yeah, Ted and Abee. Both down.
All right, thanks, sheriff.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.331
No, I can bring 'em down.
That's all right.

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.640
I got nothing but time.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:45.370
I can bring 'em to you.
That sounds good.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.244
- Dawson Cole!
- You got it.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.131
I'm so sorry.

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.770
Oh, God!

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.362
I commend the soul
of Dawson Cole to God.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.321
Amen.

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:04.206
Children's Legal Defense Fund.
Yes, of course, hold please.

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.045
- Hi, doll. Your ex called.
- Thanks, Jamie.

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:12.447
- Hey. So what'd you figure out?
- Hey.

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.841
Well, after weighing everything
that we discussed,

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:17.844
it is my recommendation that
we go all the way back to 1959.

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:20.844
We can look at the UN's declarations
of the rights of the child

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.082
and we can structure
our argument from there.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.844
Good. Thank God for paralegals.

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.524
But if we do that, we have to
make sure that we

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.921
keep in mind the 1976...

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.411
Sorry, it's my son.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.801
Well, we are the
Children's Defense Fund.

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.328
- Hi, Jared.
- Hey, Mom.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.404
<i>- Everything OK?</i>
- <i>Uh,</i> yeah.

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.320
Why wouldn't it be?

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:44.768
<i>Well, this is your third phone call
in two days. That's a record for you.</i>

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.921
Very funny.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.322
<i>No, I'm actually calling because there's
something that I wanted you to know.</i>

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.886
<i>You remember how Dr. Charbonneau
told me that if I waited a year</i>

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:54.361
<i>I could file a request to find out
who donated my heart?</i>

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.284
Yeah. Did you decide
to go ahead with it?

01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.601
<i>Well, actually, I did go ahead
with it.</i>

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.011
Oh.

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:04.727
And I got the information yesterday.
So, here, give me one second.

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.409
<i>Yeah, it says he was 39 years
old when he died.</i>

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.289
<i>Get this, he was actually
from St. Olivia,</i>

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.647
<i>so I thought that maybe you
knew him.</i>

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.324
<i>Dawson Cole.</i>

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.685
Mom, you there?

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.729
Yeah. I'm here.

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.489
<i>So, did you know him?</i>

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.608
Yes. I knew Dawson.

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.963
Great, so when I'm home for Spring Break
maybe you can tell me a bit about him.

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.966
- I <i>would love</i> that.
<i>- Oh, hey, Mom, I gotta go.</i>

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:50.289
<i>I'm meeting this girl for lunch.
She's in my English class.</i>

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.726
<i>- OK.
- I'm totally loving it here.</i>

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.288
<i>All right, I love you, Mom. Bye.</i>

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:01.726
Everything all right?

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.250
Yes. It is.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.801
Good.

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.203
So, like I was saying,
if we start in 1959, we can...

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.603
<i>Dear Amanda,</i>

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:30.002
<i>when I was young,
I looked for a shape to things.</i>

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:33.042
<i>A reason or a design.</i>

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.528
<i>So much of what happened to me,
though, felt like an accident.</i>

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.682
<i>So I guess I lost faith
in all that.</i>

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.524
<i>When I survived my fall,
I began to wonder...</i>

01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.961
...if <i>there wasn't some
purpose to my life.</i>

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.891
<i>Maybe I was on a destined path,</i>

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.724
<i>even if I couldn't see it yet.</i>

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:59.209
<i>When I saw you again, I believe
we'd been given a second chance.</i>

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.366
<i>That the universe
had decided to give us that.</i>

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:06.524
<i>You have commitments,
I understand,</i>

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.125
<i>and you want to keep them.</i>

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.529
<i>I can only love you more
for that.</i>

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:16.165
<i>I hope to see you again someday,
but if I don't...</i>

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.490
<i>...just know that these last days
have been the best of my life.</i>

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.086
<i>I love who I am
when I'm with you, Amanda.</i>

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:28.049
<i>You are my dearest friend,
my deepest love.</i>

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.648

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:39.005
