38:59.504 --> 39:00.970
With the office
in the medical-arts building.

39:00.972 --> 39:04.107
You know, half the time,
when I tell people I'm a doctor,

39:04.109 --> 39:05.842
they don't even believe me.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.680
If I fail at this...

If I can't do
emergency medicine,

39:13.684 --> 39:15.350
I got no place else to go.

much better, too.

40:10.894 --> 40:12.526
Good.
I'll be back in a bit.

it's that
I got to watch you work.

I don't get many moments

Putting my hands on patients,
literally keeping them alive,

40:34.680 --> 40:36.546
I have to admit...
it was exhilarating.

Earlier, you said that you came
here to learn from the best,

40:43.420 --> 40:45.686

you decided to stay.

40:45.688 --> 40:48.855
You humbly left out
the middle part...

40:48.857 --> 40:52.691
You learned from the best,
and then you<i> became</i> the best.

I'm sorry I couldn't see that
till now.

41:00.732 --> 41:01.964
You make me very proud.

41:03.434 --> 41:06.501
And you gave me back my wife.
