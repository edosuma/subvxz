ASIDE FROM YOU,

00:16.207 --> 00:17.375
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

YOUR OWN EGO

FORGIVE HER.

00:20.417 --> 00:20.959
FIX THIS FAMILY.

I'M SORRY, JACK.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.875
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
A LOT MORE TO YOU

I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE SCHOOL DANCE?

00:51.208 --> 00:52.375
I THINK WHAT PACEY'S JUST SAYING

00:52.375 --> 00:54.875
IS WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
THE SCHOOL DANCE TYPE.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.125
YEAH, WE'D RATHER WATCH A MOVIE
ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DANCE

00:57.125 --> 00:59.667
THAN ACTUALLY SET FOOT
INSIDE AN OVER-DECORATED GYM.

OF HIGH SCHOOL CONVENTIONS

THE BIBLE-THUMPERS IN FOOTLOOSE

BY PROMISING US

THAT DANCING ALWAYS ENDS
IN TAWDRY SMUT ACTION?

06:05.834 --> 06:08.458
OH.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.166
COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE
OUR FIRST MENTION OF SEX

06:10.166 --> 06:12.208
SINCE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER?

06:12.208 --> 06:13.000
POSSIBLY.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.208
WHY IS THAT?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.166
WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS,

06:16.166 --> 06:17.834
WE TALKED ABOUT SEX
ALL THE TIME.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.333
I THINK BECAUSE WE WANTED
TO EASE INTO THE SUBJECT

06:20.333 --> 06:22.166
IN ORDER TO MAKE
THE TRANSITION

06:22.166 --> 06:24.375
FROM FRIEND TO
LOVER UNCONFUSING.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.250

IF WE ARE CONFUSED

ABOUT THE TRANSITION
FROM FRIEND TO LOVER,

06:28.708 --> 06:30.375
UM, I CAN ONLY THINK
OF ONE THING

06:30.375 --> 06:32.375

TRULY CINCH IT.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.166
I MEAN, ABBY IS NOT

06:47.166 --> 06:49.458
A GOOD INFLUENCE
FOR JEN.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.125
HA HA. IS THIS GENUINE
CONCERN I'M HEARING

06:51.125 --> 06:52.875
FOR JEN LINDLEY?

06:52.875 --> 06:54.583
WELL, I JUST
FEEL BAD FOR HER.

FEEL WORSE

THAN SHE ALREADY DOES?

07:11.041 --> 07:12.250
I DON'T KNOW.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.750
I MEAN, ALL I KNOW IS

07:13.750 --> 07:17.000
THAT IT IS REALLY HARD
TO LOSE A FAMILY MEMBER,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.583

07:49.125 --> 07:51.083

AT YOUR HOUSE,

07:51.083 --> 07:52.917

SOMEWHERE ELSE?

07:52.917 --> 07:53.333
LET'S MEET SOMEWHERE.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.917

DOING, ANYWAY?

07:56.625 --> 07:59.166

07:59.166 --> 08:00.125
YOU KNOW, ANDIE, IF
THERE'S EVER

08:00.125 --> 08:02.625
ANYTHING I CAN DO,
YOU JUST...

08:02.625 --> 08:04.667
JUST ASK ME, ALL RIGHT?

08:04.667 --> 08:05.792
SO, WITTER...

08:05.792 --> 08:09.500
I HOPE YOU HAVE YOUR MOVES
POLISHED AND READY,

08:09.500 --> 08:11.750
BECAUSE I PLAN ON MAKING
A DANCING FOOL OUT OF YOU.

08:11.750 --> 08:12.625
SORRY. NO CAN DO,
MCPHEE. I DON'T DANCE.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.250
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T DANCE?

08:15.250 --> 08:16.291
WELL, IT'S SIMPLE.
I DON'T LIKE IT,

08:16.291 --> 08:18.291
AND I'M REALLY NOT
ANY GOOD AT IT.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.750
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT I'M JUST GOING.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.500
SO DON'T EXPECT ME
TO GET OUT THERE

08:20.500 --> 08:22.417
AND START BUSTING A MOVE,

08:22.417 --> 08:23.667
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.166
YOU ARE BEYOND IMMATURE.
WELL, YOU'RE OVERBEARING.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.000
BORING.
HYPERSENSITIVE.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.208
VULGAR.
PICK YOU UP AT 7:00?

08:28.208 --> 08:29.125
GREAT.
OKAY.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.875
ARE YOU TWO
HAVING A SPAT?

08:31.875 --> 08:33.082
NO. IT'S JUST OUR USUAL
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE BANTER.

08:33.082 --> 08:34.500
NO. ACTUALLY,

08:34.500 --> 08:37.207
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE DANCE,

08:37.207 --> 08:38.500
AND, HEY,
IF YOU GUYS DON'T MIND,

08:38.500 --> 08:41.125
I'D REALLY LIKE TO INVITE
MY BROTHER, JACK, TO COME ALONG.

34:26.375 --> 34:29.833
IN FACT, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.208
YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T DANCE, PACEY.

34:31.208 --> 34:34.291
WELL, DID YOU
SEE ME OUT THERE?

34:34.291 --> 34:36.708
COME ON, YOU COULD HARDLY
CALL THAT DANCING.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.542
NO. I'D CALL IT FOREPLAY.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.375
BUT THEN AGAIN, WE DON'T
OWE ANY EXPLANATIONS

34:40.375 --> 34:42.083
TO EACH OTHER, DO WE?

34:42.083 --> 34:43.708
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST
SPARRING PARTNERS, RIGHT?

34:43.708 --> 34:45.625
WE DON'T MEAN ANYTHING MORE
TO EACH OTHER THAN THAT.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.458
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

34:47.458 --> 34:49.083
YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT TRUE, ANDIE.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.708
I WAS--I WAS HAVING

34:51.708 --> 34:53.083
A WONDERFUL TIME
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

34:53.083 --> 34:54.166
I WAS!

34:54.166 --> 34:56.083
IT'S JUST--WHEN I RAN
INTO CHRISTY,

34:56.083 --> 34:58.417
I DON'T KNOW--I JUST--

34:58.417 --> 35:00.125
I GOT SWEPT UP
IN THE MOMENT.

35:00.125 --> 35:01.875
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S TOO BAD

35:01.875 --> 35:03.166
THAT I'M NOT
THE KIND OF GIRL

35:03.166 --> 35:04.667
WHO CAN SWEEP YOU AWAY.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.208
COME ON, ANDIE.
ANDIE.

35:06.208 --> 35:09.291
COME ON. YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT I MEANT.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.291
IT'S JUST--

35:10.291 --> 35:13.667
I DON'T KNOW--
CHRISTY, SHE'S...

35:13.667 --> 35:15.083
SHE'S--SHE'S
LIKE A FANTASY.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.083
AND, COME ON,
YOU CAN'T TELL ME

35:17.083 --> 35:18.625
YOU HAVEN'T WANTED
TO ACT OUT A FANTASY,

35:18.625 --> 35:20.291
I MEAN, EVEN IF
JUST FOR A MOMENT.

35:20.291 --> 35:21.708
EVEN IF YOU KNEW
IT WAS WRONG.

35:21.708 --> 35:25.625
I WAS TRYING TO ACT OUT
A FANTASY ALL NIGHT, PACEY.

35:29.041 --> 35:30.333
WHY DO YOU LIKE ME?

35:31.583 --> 35:32.583
WHAT?

35:32.583 --> 35:35.125
WHY DO YOU LIKE ME?

35:35.125 --> 35:36.667
I'M A SCREWUP, ANDIE.

35:36.667 --> 35:37.417
I'M THOUGHTLESS.
I'M INSECURE,

35:37.417 --> 35:39.333
AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME,

35:39.333 --> 35:41.625
I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY A WOMAN LIKE YOU

35:41.625 --> 35:42.917
WOULD BOTHER
TO CARE ABOUT ME.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.750
GOD, I DON'T KNOW, PACEY.

35:46.750 --> 35:49.625
BECAUSE YOU'RE FUNNY,
AND YOU'RE KIND,

35:49.625 --> 35:51.625
AND YOU DON'T
JUDGE PEOPLE,

35:51.625 --> 35:54.625
AND YOU MAKE ME
FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

35:54.625 --> 35:56.792
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T RUN
SCREAMING THE OTHER DAY

35:56.792 --> 35:57.959
FROM MY HOUSE

35:57.959 --> 35:59.625
WHEN YOU MET
MY CRAZY OLD MOTHER.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.959
AND YOU'RE SMART.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.083
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW

36:02.083 --> 36:04.458
WHERE YOU GET THIS WHOLE
LOSER COMPLEX, PACEY,

36:04.458 --> 36:06.250
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO SMART.

36:06.250 --> 36:10.000
I MEAN, YOU SPAR BETTER
WITH ME THAN ANYONE.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.875
AND...YOU'RE SHARP.

36:12.875 --> 36:14.959
AND YOU'RE WITTY.

36:14.959 --> 36:16.500
AND YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

36:18.458 --> 36:21.417
AND THIS IS MORE THAN
YOU DESERVE RIGHT NOW.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.542
I KNOW. I KNOW.

36:25.542 --> 36:28.333
ANDIE...I KNOW.

36:29.834 --> 36:31.917
I'M REALLY, TRULY SORRY.

36:31.917 --> 36:35.417
I AM. I'M SORRIER THAN
I'VE BEEN IN A LONG TIME.

36:35.417 --> 36:38.500
THE MOMENT THAT
I SPENT WITH CHRISTY,

36:38.500 --> 36:40.291
THAT ONE MOMENT

36:40.291 --> 36:43.208
THAT WAS GONNA MAKE THE
WHOLE NIGHT WORTHWHILE...

36:43.208 --> 36:45.083
I WAS WITH
THE WRONG PERSON.

36:46.250 --> 36:50.083
I WANT TO SPEND
THAT MOMENT WITH YOU.

36:52.542 --> 36:54.458
WELL, WE'RE CERTAINLY
HAVING ONE NOW, AREN'T WE?

36:58.375 --> 37:00.834
WOULD YOU PLEASE DANCE
WITH ME, MISS MCPHEE?

37:00.834 --> 37:02.708
I'D LOVE TO.

37:02.708 --> 37:05.500
[♪♪♪]

37:14.125 --> 37:16.333
SHARP, WITTY,
AND BRILLIANT, HUH?

37:16.333 --> 37:17.542
ANYTHING YOU'D CARE
TO ADD TO THAT?

37:17.542 --> 37:20.458
IF YOU THINK I FIND
THIS CHARMING, PACEY,

37:20.458 --> 37:21.834
YOU'RE MAJORLY DELUDED.

37:21.834 --> 37:23.041
OF COURSE. HOW COULD YOU?
I'M A WITLESS BORE.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.875
OAFISH CLOD.
MAJOR CAD.

37:24.875 --> 37:25.708
KISS ME?

37:25.708 --> 37:28.291
THOUGHT YOU'D
NEVER ASK.

37:28.291 --> 37:30.375
[♪♪♪]

38:10.750 --> 38:11.583
JOEY.

38:23.875 --> 38:26.917
DAWSON...

38:26.917 --> 38:31.333
I AM SO SORRY.

38:31.333 --> 38:34.208
WHAT HAPPENED, JOEY?

38:34.208 --> 38:36.667
I TOLD YOU, JACK
KISSED ME AND--

38:36.667 --> 38:39.083
NOT JACK.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT JACK.

38:39.083 --> 38:43.041
I MEAN, WITH US.

38:43.041 --> 38:45.333
WHAT IS GOING ON
BETWEEN US?

38:48.875 --> 38:51.166
I DON'T KNOW, DAWSON.

38:51.166 --> 38:54.667
I MEAN, I--

38:54.667 --> 38:56.291
JOEY, EVER SINCE
WE GOT TOGETHER,

38:56.291 --> 38:57.625
YOU'VE BEEN
PULLING AWAY FROM ME.

39:00.834 --> 39:03.750
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
WHAT YOU WANTED.

39:03.750 --> 39:06.291
YOU KNOW?

39:06.291 --> 39:08.125
I THOUGHT I WAS
WHAT YOU WANTED.

39:08.125 --> 39:09.166
YOU ARE.

39:09.166 --> 39:11.166
AM I?

39:14.250 --> 39:16.166
YOU'RE WHAT I'M GOING
TO WANT, DAWSON.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.542
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

39:21.166 --> 39:24.458
FOR SO LONG, ALL I'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT WAS YOU.

39:24.458 --> 39:28.333
I MEAN, ALL I DREAMED
ABOUT WAS YOU.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.625
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:30.166 --> 39:33.792
I GOT MY DREAM.

39:33.792 --> 39:39.166
AND...AND NOW I FEEL LIKE...
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE.

39:39.166 --> 39:43.000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
YOUR FUTURE

39:43.000 --> 39:45.417
SO PERFECTLY
PLANNED, DAWSON.

39:45.417 --> 39:46.375
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

39:46.375 --> 39:48.875
WHAT YOU WANT
TO ACCOMPLISH,

39:48.875 --> 39:53.834
AND...AND ME, I--

39:53.834 --> 39:55.375
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM,

39:55.375 --> 39:56.917
LET ALONE, YOU KNOW,

39:56.917 --> 39:59.542
WHAT I WANT TO BE
AND ACCOMPLISH.

39:59.542 --> 40:03.083
I...I GUESS I--I...

40:03.083 --> 40:05.375
I NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT,
AND...

40:05.375 --> 40:08.750
I NEED TO FIND MY SOMETHING.

40:08.750 --> 40:11.875
SO WE'LL FIND IT.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.708
IT CAN'T INCLUDE YOU,
DAWSON.

40:16.708 --> 40:22.458
IT HAS TO BE MY DOING
AND MINE ALONE.

40:22.458 --> 40:25.041
YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY.

40:25.041 --> 40:29.458
YOU KNOW? I...I--

40:29.458 --> 40:32.834
BUT I HAVE TO MAKE MYSELF
HAPPY FIRST.

40:32.834 --> 40:35.333
AND THAT'S...
PROBABLY...

40:35.333 --> 40:37.250
THE ONE THING
IN THIS WHOLE WORLD

40:37.250 --> 40:41.250
THAT YOU CAN'T DO FOR ME.

40:41.250 --> 40:41.708
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

40:47.125 --> 40:50.959
JOEY?

40:50.959 --> 40:52.834
JOEY, NO--JOEY!

40:52.834 --> 40:54.291
I LOVE YOU.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.750
I LOVE YOU TOO, DAWSON.

41:18.125 --> 41:19.458
WAI--W-WAIT!

41:19.458 --> 41:22.083
B-BUT HOW CAN IT BE OVER?

41:22.083 --> 41:23.875
WE--WE CAN'T JUST
SAY "I LOVE YOU"

41:23.875 --> 41:26.917
FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND HAVE IT BE OVER.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.750
I HAVE TO GO, DAWSON.

41:31.458 --> 41:34.000
GOOD NIGHT.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.458
YOU, UH--
