WEBVTT

00:02.961 --> 00:07.172
Listen, you know what? Sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.801
We did not take a bag
of Meshugga Nuts from the minibar.

00:11.052 --> 00:14.763
And we did not watch
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

00:16.599 --> 00:17.641
- Hey.
- Oh.

00:17.809 --> 00:21.478
- Joey, were you in our room last night?
- No.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.613
I was told the name of the movie
would not appear on the bill.

00:33.908 --> 00:38.954
- Hi, we're checking out of the bridal suite.
- That's right, I'm no longer a bride.

00:39.164 --> 00:43.208
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.087
And I'm the happiest guy
in the world.

00:48.923 --> 00:52.051
Come on, honey. Don't be upset.
We have so much to look forward to.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.886
Yeah, right.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.972
- The honeymoon.
- That's not till Thursday.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.767
- The wedding pictures.
- Those won't be ready weeks.

00:59.976 --> 01:05.773
- Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
- That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!

01:06.316 --> 01:10.027
I'll tell you what. I will go get them developed,
and you can go home.

01:13.364 --> 01:18.577
- What? What did you take a picture of?
- Nothing. It was something.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.331
Okay, Ross has the cameras.
Is he checked out yet?

01:22.540 --> 01:25.667
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

01:25.877 --> 01:30.172
- And he has a good 11 minutes left.
- So?

01:30.381 --> 01:33.550
So Ross has never checked out of a room
a minute before he had to.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.469
Yeah, one time when we were dating...

01:35.637 --> 01:40.057
...we got a late checkout, he got so excited,
it was the best sex we ever had.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.852
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.816
Okay, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras,
and get them developed.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.363
Thirty-two, Joe. You're 32!

01:56.908 --> 01:59.284
- Here's a copy of your bill.
- Oh, thanks.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.704
Champagne, strawberries...

02:03.498 --> 02:08.544
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.464
Yeah, that's sad.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.383
Meshugga Nut?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.384
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.139
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this stuff?

03:02.348 --> 03:07.853
- Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
- Yeah, but you don't need...

03:08.104 --> 03:11.106
- What is this?
- Thread.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.109
Score!

03:15.236 --> 03:18.488
- Where are the disposable cameras?
- What disposable cameras?

03:18.656 --> 03:20.699
Last night I asked you to take them.

03:20.909 --> 03:25.037
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, before we cut the cake, I said...

03:25.246 --> 03:27.956
Yeah, you came up to me
and asked me for a favor.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.001
And then my Uncle Murray came up to you
and handed you a check.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.963
Then you said, "Why do they call it a check?
Why not a Yugoslavian?"

03:38.927 --> 03:43.388
- Yeah, then you did that.
- So you don't have the cameras?

03:43.598 --> 03:45.307
- No, sorry.
- So what? What?

03:45.475 --> 03:48.810
- They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
- I'm sure they're here somewhere.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.437
I'll help you look.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.981
- Great.
- In three minutes.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.415
- Hey
- Hey.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.752
Are you gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

04:14.003 --> 04:15.337
No.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.466
They're calling out to me.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.637
This little guy even crawled
up in my lap.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.682
Come on, Chandler wouldn't mind
if I opened just one present.

04:26.849 --> 04:27.975
What do you think it is?

04:28.810 --> 04:34.189
A mirror that when you look into it,
you see yourself as an old woman.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.361
A tiny salt shaker!

04:39.570 --> 04:43.407
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

04:43.616 --> 04:46.368
Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.577
Oh, yeah.

04:47.745 --> 04:50.539
I'm just gonna wait for Chandler
to open up the rest of them.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.499
- Okay.
- Whoo!

04:52.834 --> 04:58.588
Although, you know, this is part
of a salt-and-pepper set.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.009
So I guess it may just count as half a present.
What do you think?

05:02.218 --> 05:06.596
Well, I guess it's okay to open one more
if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.682
Or this one!

05:10.893 --> 05:11.977
Hi.

05:12.186 --> 05:16.356
- How you feeling? Got any morning sickness?
- Shh! The guys don't know yet, do they?

05:16.566 --> 05:20.152
No. Joey and Ross don't know anything,
and Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.363
That's right.
Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.

05:23.781 --> 05:27.534
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling,
or offered to carry my bags.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.287
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.292
After you, of course.

05:35.501 --> 05:39.254
Don't worry. I promise that you will only have
to be pregnant a few more hours.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.089
I'm going to tell the father today.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.301
Is it someone in this building?
That tall guy from the first floor?

05:44.510 --> 05:48.180
- Eww! No!
- What? I think he's cute.

05:48.389 --> 05:51.683
- Well, then you have his baby.
- Believe me, I'm trying.

05:52.894 --> 05:56.438
Wow. It's so weird.
You're gonna tell this guy today...

05:56.606 --> 05:59.107
...and he has no idea
what's gonna happen.

05:59.317 --> 06:04.112
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.783
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.660
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

06:12.622 --> 06:17.459
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty big news.
- Pretty big? It's huge!

06:17.668 --> 06:21.004
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
He's walking around thinking:

06:21.255 --> 06:23.799
"I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!"

06:24.801 --> 06:28.011
Then, bam!
He's a father, everything's different.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.349
Well, it's only different if he wants it to be.
I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.602
Then he still has this huge decision
to make. Now he's thinking:

06:35.853 --> 06:38.772
"Do I want to be a dad?"
Then, bam!

06:38.981 --> 06:43.610
- What was that "bam"?
- I don't know. He's hit by a bus.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.656
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:47.824 --> 06:52.452
Joey, what would you do if someone
you slept with told you she was pregnant?

06:58.668 --> 07:00.001
Who called here?

07:02.088 --> 07:06.425
Did she sound blond? Any accent?
I gotta make a call.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.844
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

07:09.011 --> 07:12.848
Oh, Joey! Joey! It's not you!
You didn't get anyone pregnant.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.769
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

07:20.731 --> 07:22.232
Is somebody pregnant?

07:24.193 --> 07:25.986
Oh, yeah! That's me.

07:27.905 --> 07:31.366
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.201
Yes, I am.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.246
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

07:37.498 --> 07:41.042
- Wait, who's the father?
- You don't know him.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.046
He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby.

07:48.342 --> 07:53.472
Who is this guy? Who is he?
Because I'll track him down and kick his ass!

07:54.182 --> 07:56.057
- David Linn.
- David Linn!

07:56.225 --> 07:59.227
David Linn! David Linn!

08:00.646 --> 08:04.441
- Who's David Linn?
- Some guy from my gym. A little annoying.

08:10.072 --> 08:13.241
- Chandler?
- Hey. Did you find the cameras?

08:13.451 --> 08:14.659
No. Did you?

08:14.827 --> 08:18.288
Yes, that's why I'm under the table.
Celebrating.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.208
I checked in the lost and found.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.627
I talked to the manager.
No one's turned them in.

08:23.794 --> 08:28.632
Great. Those cameras were the only thing
that will cheer Monica up. She's depressed.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.593
You guys just got married.
Why is she so depressed?

08:31.802 --> 08:35.347
All my energy is going into
not asking that question.

08:36.807 --> 08:40.352
- I can't believe I screwed this up!
- I'm sorry, man.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.566
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

08:46.817 --> 08:50.278
There's a band. There's gonna be
plenty of dressed up people.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.615
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

08:53.824 --> 08:59.871
No, we buy more of these at the gift shop,
throw our tuxes on and take a few pictures.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.749
All have to do is make sure
not to get people's faces.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.626
Are you serious?

09:04.835 --> 09:07.212
I'm just thinking about your new bride.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.757
Okay? Do you really want to start your
life together by letting her down?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.135
Marriage advice? Really?

09:16.138 --> 09:18.682
I'm telling you,
this looks exactly like your wedding.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.310
- Aren't these the same flowers?
- I don't know. Monica picked them.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.813
- The chairs?
- Those too.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.773
- The place settings?
- Her.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.026
- What did you do?
- I was in charge of the cameras.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.195
- Gift shop?
- Mm.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.576
Hey.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.121
- Did you do it yet?
- Not yet.

09:41.330 --> 09:45.041
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

09:45.209 --> 09:47.419
- Is it Gunther?
- No...

09:49.046 --> 09:53.383
- It's not Gunther!
- Thank God. That hair on a baby?

09:54.969 --> 10:00.599
The father is not here. I haven't
told him, and I don't think I can now.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.726
- Why not?
- Now let me think.

10:02.893 --> 10:08.023
I was walking down the street, thinking, "I'm
gonna tell the father today." And then, bam!

10:08.899 --> 10:10.483
Bus?

10:11.485 --> 10:16.865
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.117
- But it is huge.
- I know.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.203
But I was just thinking
about how huge it was for me.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.040
I didn't go to how huge
this is gonna be for the father.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.584
You're thinking about this
way too much.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.003
Just tell him and get it over with.

10:30.171 --> 10:34.257
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless. Watch.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.551
Oh, mother of...!

10:38.638 --> 10:40.597
See?

10:45.770 --> 10:50.982
- Ooh. Are we opening presents?
- No. I shouldn't have even opened these.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.735
Joey, I am out of control!

10:54.862 --> 10:56.196
You have to do me a favor.

10:56.364 --> 11:01.117
No matter what I say, no matter what I do,
please do not let me open another present.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.286
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.415
- Give me one more.
- Okay.

11:09.627 --> 11:14.422
- Hey.
- Oh, good. You're here. Pheebs? Listen...

11:14.757 --> 11:18.426
- Sit down, I got something I want to say.
- All right.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.431
Um...

11:25.184 --> 11:29.270
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

11:29.438 --> 11:34.693
Now, I always felt that you
and I have a special bond.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.282
So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

11:44.995 --> 11:47.288
Oh, my God!

11:48.499 --> 11:51.418
- Joey!
- Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.841
- You can't marry him!
- Hey, lady, your day's over, it's my turn.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.593
- Phoebe!
- What? Why can't she marry me?

12:00.761 --> 12:03.346
I can and I will.

12:04.348 --> 12:08.643
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant, okay.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.312
- Oh, my God!
- Hey.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.232
He'd notice when you didn't
have a baby in nine months!

12:14.483 --> 12:16.818
It's Joey!

12:17.486 --> 12:18.862
I love you.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.867
I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?

12:24.034 --> 12:25.869
- Yeah.
- Who's the father?

12:26.120 --> 12:27.996
We don't know.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.001
- I wonder if it's that dude.
- There's a dude?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.044
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

12:35.212 --> 12:41.217
A month ago this guy spent the night.
I didn't see who it was, but...

12:46.849 --> 12:48.641
Was that story over?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.773
The guy left this.

12:54.940 --> 12:59.194
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.367
People have got
to finish their stories.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.753
- Excuse me. Could you take a picture of us?
- Oh. Of course.

13:20.341 --> 13:26.221
- Would you take one of us?
- Uh. Yeah, sure.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.264
Click.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.893
- It didn't click.
- I heard it.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.563
- But there was no flash.
- Why won't you take our picture?

13:35.731 --> 13:38.316
Yeah, I'll take your picture.

13:40.152 --> 13:45.406
- Your finger was covering the lens.
- Who are you, Ansel Adams? Get out of here!

13:49.662 --> 13:53.748
Look, I feel really bad about how
I freaked you out before...

13:53.916 --> 13:56.960
...so I called the father
and asked him to meet you here. Go!

13:57.169 --> 14:01.172
What? Wait a minute.
How do you even know who the father is?

14:01.382 --> 14:04.759
I may play the fool at times...

14:04.969 --> 14:09.430
...but I'm more than a pretty blond
with an ass that won't quit.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.602
I believe this belongs to the father
of your baby.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.563
Oh, God.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.816
- Oh. He's in there right now?
- Uh-huh.

14:20.109 --> 14:24.529
You can turn around, or you can go in there
and rip the Band-Aid off.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.947
What do you wanna do?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.617
- Let's rip.
- Really? Are you sure?

14:29.785 --> 14:32.161
- Phoebe!
- Okay. Sorry. Yeah.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.624
Hey, Rach.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.551
Go on-stage. I'll get a picture
of you doing the speech.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.052
Okay. Okay.

15:05.654 --> 15:09.741
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre
please see the front desk?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.493
Your car is about to be towed.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.582
That's my car!

15:18.375 --> 15:21.252
- A '95 LeSabre?
- Yes.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.213
- A green LeSabre?
- Yes!

15:26.967 --> 15:30.803
- I'm sorry, I meant blue.
- Yes, green-blue.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.643
Well, go. Go move it!

15:38.103 --> 15:40.688
- Okay. Ready for the last picture?
- Yeah.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.106
Get ready to run.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.406
Congratulations on your wedding.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.790
So, what's this about?

15:58.999 --> 16:01.626
Rachel has something
that she wants to tell you.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.922
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.

16:06.090 --> 16:10.218
No, this is my red sweater.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.305
Oh, no.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.560
Could I get anyone a coffee?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.940
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.235
What's going on?

16:27.403 --> 16:31.489
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

16:31.907 --> 16:36.494
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
Are you involved in some kind of dare?

16:37.663 --> 16:40.331
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.756
I know we broke up because you thought
I wasn't mature enough...

16:48.924 --> 16:52.468
...but I've really grown up.
And I think we should get back together.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.804
It's just not the right time.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.640
- It is the right time.
- Okay.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.809
- I'm ready for more.
- Tag.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.311
Come on, Rach.
Let's give it another try.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.023
- I'm having a baby.
- Oh.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.451
- You can go.
- Thank you.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.833
I don't know how
any of these got opened!

17:25.627 --> 17:29.547
- You opened them all?
- I know, I am a terrible person.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.675
Chandler's never gonna trust me
with anything ever again.

17:33.052 --> 17:37.221
- Hey! You got my parents' gift.
- Yeah. What is that?

17:37.431 --> 17:40.475
I don't know.
I think it does something to salami.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.230
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Yeah. What did Tag say?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.650
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

17:49.902 --> 17:53.905
I do, Rach. I do.
And I'm so happy for you.

17:56.575 --> 18:00.119
Oh. Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.166
So are you ever gonna tell
whoever it is?

18:05.334 --> 18:08.086
I will, I'm just not up for it tonight.

18:08.253 --> 18:12.131
Hey, Rach, listen. No matter what he says,
you're not gonna be alone.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.716
- I'm not?
- No.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.719
Listen, I, uh...

18:18.597 --> 18:22.683
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.893
Aww.

18:24.103 --> 18:28.064
I've always felt like
you and I have this special bond.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.110
- Rachel Green, will you marry me?
- What?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.903
- What?
- What?!

18:35.405 --> 18:38.032
- Pheebs, give me the ring back.
- No!

18:38.700 --> 18:42.495
Joey, you're so sweet.
You are so, so sweet, honey.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.789
But I'm not looking for a husband.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.419
I understand.

18:51.421 --> 18:55.716
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.349
I can't say that didn't hurt.

19:05.269 --> 19:09.939
- But I'll take you back, Joey.
- About that, I...

19:10.149 --> 19:13.359
- Ohh, a Salami Buddy!
- There you go!

19:14.736 --> 19:16.404
- We're back!
- Great.

19:16.613 --> 19:20.032
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.537
- It's picture time.
- You're gonna love these.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.581
Here's a picture of Ross.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.375
And that's me.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.129
And that's me and Ross.

19:34.256 --> 19:38.509
Aww. And here's our first kiss
as a married couple.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.554
Wow. That is a great picture.

19:41.763 --> 19:46.100
Yeah. And interesting, because I found
the cameras in one of our bags.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.273
Huh. Didn't see that coming.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.568
Okay, so this isn't
the picture of our first kiss...

19:55.777 --> 19:59.822
...but it is a picture of my first kiss
with this lady.

20:01.491 --> 20:06.829
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure
you'll remember, so there's no need...

20:08.123 --> 20:10.249
I'll take the real pictures
to them developed.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.543
- That'd be a good idea.
- Okay.

20:16.798 --> 20:20.593
You opened all the presents without me?
We were gonna do that together.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.012
You kissed another woman?

20:24.598 --> 20:26.307
- Call it even?
- Okay.

20:32.522 --> 20:37.318
- Well, I'm gonna go get these in some water.
- You stole those from that wedding?

20:37.611 --> 20:41.989
No, the hotel lobby. They think
they can charge me for some dirty movie...

20:42.157 --> 20:45.743
...and a bag of Meshugga Nuts
they got another thing coming!

20:49.081 --> 20:51.123
Hey, my sweater!

20:54.002 --> 20:57.004
I've been looking for this for like a month.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.719
Oh, my God!

21:10.811 --> 21:12.395
Oh, my God!

21:19.611 --> 21:23.447
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. Long time no see.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.827
- Like your sweater.
- Oh. Hey. Right back at you.

21:30.706 --> 21:35.418
- It's crazy about Rachel.
- Yeah. Well, she's one crazy lady.

21:36.128 --> 21:41.173
- So whose is it?
- Um, I don't know, some Italian guy.

21:42.551 --> 21:46.053
Come on, read your own label.
See you later.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.931
- Okay.
- He is so weird.
