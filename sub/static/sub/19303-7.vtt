WEBVTT

00:06.007 --> 00:07.759
<i>Meditation starts in 20 minutes...</i>

00:09.427 --> 00:12.013
<i>...in the activity room.</i>

02:15.345 --> 02:17.180
What did he do with it?

02:18.348 --> 02:19.474
What did he do with it?

02:19.641 --> 02:21.100
What did he do with it?

02:21.267 --> 02:23.770
What did he do with it?
What did he do with it?

02:23.937 --> 02:25.021
What did he do with it?

02:25.188 --> 02:27.649
What did he do with it?

02:29.859 --> 02:31.861
Hey, sexy.

02:37.909 --> 02:40.578
Tell me about the day David came
to live with you.

02:42.455 --> 02:43.706
Why?

02:43.873 --> 02:46.417
A man brought him. Yeah?

02:48.211 --> 02:50.129
- I was 4.
- But you remember.

02:50.296 --> 02:52.590
Don't lie.

02:55.802 --> 02:56.803
It was late.

03:00.014 --> 03:05.353
<i>I was in my room and I heard voices.</i>

03:07.981 --> 03:10.608
<i>So I snuck out onto the landing.</i>

03:15.071 --> 03:16.865
Look at that.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.909
For a long time, I thought it was a dream.

03:23.997 --> 03:25.957
Yeah, that was him.

03:29.502 --> 03:31.421
What did he do with it?

03:32.297 --> 03:34.340
What did he do with it?

03:34.507 --> 03:35.633
What did he do with it?

03:35.800 --> 03:39.304
Why are you doing this?
He was just a baby.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.306
He's not a baby now.

03:42.765 --> 03:46.936
Uh-oh. Looks like one of the animals
is out of its pen.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.074
Fascinating.

04:00.241 --> 04:05.496
You've manifested your cryogenic state
into a literal ice cube.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.710
When I woke up this morning,
I thought to myself:

04:10.877 --> 04:12.629
It's gonna be daylight savings soon.

04:12.795 --> 04:16.716
Then I realized I don't know
what that means.

04:16.883 --> 04:20.219
It's when you set the clocks
forward or back...

04:20.386 --> 04:25.391
...to maximize daylight
during the workday.

04:25.683 --> 04:26.726
Oh.

04:28.061 --> 04:29.395
That's not very interesting.

04:29.562 --> 04:32.857
I thought we were literally saving daylight.

04:34.651 --> 04:36.319
My God.

04:36.486 --> 04:38.988
- Oliver, you haven't aged an hour.
- Oh. Oh, ooh.

04:39.155 --> 04:40.198
Oh. Oh.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.452
- Wait till Melanie sees--
- Melanie?

04:44.619 --> 04:47.997
- Your wife.
- My wife?

04:48.498 --> 04:50.166
Is she--?

04:50.833 --> 04:53.920
For some reason I want to say Chinese?

04:54.087 --> 04:56.839
- No, she's not Chinese.
- Got it.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.591
Japanese?

04:58.758 --> 05:01.719
- No, not Asian in any way. No.
- Ah.

05:01.886 --> 05:02.929
Hm.

05:04.055 --> 05:06.891
Good to know. I've been in here
a long time, you see.

05:07.058 --> 05:08.768
At least I think I have.

05:08.935 --> 05:13.564
Hours. Or what's longer than hours?

05:13.731 --> 05:15.233
Years.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.445
My memory is a bit, um-- It's a bit, uh....

05:19.862 --> 05:22.323
What's the word? What's the word?

05:22.865 --> 05:25.076
Dishes? No.

05:25.243 --> 05:26.828
Anyhow...

05:26.995 --> 05:29.747
...I suppose we'd better rescue them,
then, your friends.

05:29.914 --> 05:34.669
I've been watching, you see,
this David person and his monster.

05:34.836 --> 05:38.047
He can't find us in here
in case you're worrying.

05:38.214 --> 05:41.134
- The parasite.
- Yes, that's what I said. Parasite.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.343
Mental obviously.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.512
Yes, a separate consciousness
from David--

05:44.679 --> 05:48.766
- Has attached itself to him and has been--
- Using his power to feed its own.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.477
- Are you gonna do that the whole time?
- Do what?

05:51.644 --> 05:56.315
- Finishing my sentences.
- No, I'm sorry. Old habit.

05:58.735 --> 06:01.696
You're not in any way a tenor per chance,
are you?

06:01.863 --> 06:04.949
- A tenor?
- We're starting a barbershop quartet.

06:05.116 --> 06:07.994
David and myself.
"Roll Out The Barrel," that kind of thing.

06:08.161 --> 06:11.456
Nothing serious. Just fun.
Oh, which reminds me....

06:12.331 --> 06:13.875
You know what it is, don't you?

06:14.042 --> 06:15.877
I'm sorry. I'm having trouble keeping up.

06:16.044 --> 06:19.255
- What--?
- The monster. You know what it is.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.466
Or should I say who.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.052
Farouk.

06:24.510 --> 06:28.097
I read David's mind, you see, when they
were trapped here. He and David.

06:28.264 --> 06:30.266
He's very clever, our monster.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.394
But he puts all his energy
into tricking David.

06:33.561 --> 06:37.231
Didn't think to watch his 6.
And by 6, I mean....

06:37.398 --> 06:39.567
- What do I mean?
- Wait, wait, you're saying--

06:39.734 --> 06:42.278
Of course. Amahl Farouk.
I should have known.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.863
The dog.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.574
- Oh. There's a dog?
- In David's memories...

06:46.741 --> 06:50.119
...he's disguised himself
as a really very cute little beagle...

06:50.286 --> 06:53.247
...but the name, King, I should....

06:53.414 --> 06:57.418
Amahl Farouk, the Shadow King.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.296
- We have to rescue them.
- Didn't I just say that?

07:00.463 --> 07:04.217
I'm sure I said that. "Rescue them."
After the whole Chinese wife debate.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.219
Which I'm still not totally convinced.

07:06.385 --> 07:11.307
Are you sure she's not? Because I seem
to have a very intimate recollection of--

07:11.474 --> 07:14.519
All right, then.
Then the next question is how?

07:15.311 --> 07:16.813
How do we rescue them?

07:16.979 --> 07:19.857
We are just minds after all.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.110
And their bodies...

07:22.777 --> 07:24.320
...are in quite a jumble.

07:25.947 --> 07:28.366
Facing certain death and all that.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.456
He's too powerful for me, Farouk.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.794
He's too virile psychically.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.840
David could break you out of the dream,
possibly all of you...

07:44.006 --> 07:45.883
...but he's compromised currently.

07:48.928 --> 07:52.807
Farouk has locked him away
in a tiny corner of his mind.

07:52.974 --> 07:55.685
He'll be gone entirely soon.

07:55.852 --> 08:00.148
And then the Shadow King
will become David.

08:01.858 --> 08:03.526
There's too much vermouth.

08:03.693 --> 08:07.071
You want me
to put a little bit more vodka in there?

08:11.617 --> 08:13.578
David.

08:17.373 --> 08:19.250
My device.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.295
I made a halo randomly firing
electromagnetic signals...

08:22.461 --> 08:26.591
...in a 360-degree radius which should,
if we could put it on David's head--

08:26.757 --> 08:29.677
The real David in the now frozen timeline.

08:29.844 --> 08:31.804
--it should block the Shadow King.

08:31.971 --> 08:35.933
Isolate it and end the hospital fantasy.

08:36.100 --> 08:40.104
Unfreezing time and executing your friends
in a hail of bullets unfortunately.

08:40.271 --> 08:42.440
Unless we can physically change
the dynamic of the room.

08:42.607 --> 08:44.859
Block the bullets, move the bodies.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.821
We're gonna need everybody.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.244
May I introduce you to my friend
Jules Verne?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.624
It's all right.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.668
He can't hear us in here, the monster.

10:25.835 --> 10:30.256
He's very powerful, but Oliver
has a few tricks left up his sleeve.

10:30.423 --> 10:34.677
- First of all--
- Syd, it's easier if I just talk.

10:35.261 --> 10:37.888
- The hospital wasn't real.
- No shit.

10:38.055 --> 10:41.100
To be accurate, there is a real hospital,
but we weren't there.

10:41.267 --> 10:45.146
It was a mental projection
created by the monster.

10:45.396 --> 10:47.773
- I've been paying attention.
- Right. Well, so--

10:47.940 --> 10:50.151
Our bodies are
in David's childhood bedroom...

10:50.318 --> 10:52.486
...probably frozen in time.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.156
And if I remember,
someone just fired a machine gun.

10:55.323 --> 10:58.200
So I'm thinking when time starts again,
we'll all be killed.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.452
Yes, wow.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.787
What we have to do
is distract the monster...

11:01.954 --> 11:05.374
...who looks like Lenny, but isn't, so we can
save our bodies without her knowing...

11:05.541 --> 11:08.419
...and end the hospital fantasy
and save David.

11:08.586 --> 11:10.629
Right, and there's a device. I built a--

11:10.796 --> 11:15.551
Great, so I'll go to the hospital and save the
others and deal with Lenny and you fix it...

11:15.718 --> 11:18.262
...so I'm not murdered when I wake up.

11:19.180 --> 11:21.432
- Are we good?
- Yeah, that's what I was--

11:21.599 --> 11:24.560
- Great, let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.437
You'll need these.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.358
Oliver made them.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.361
That's Melanie's, uh-- Anyway...

11:33.527 --> 11:36.280
...he has some control here.

11:36.447 --> 11:39.950
And he made these to help us.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.829
They'll show you what's real
and what isn't.

11:43.996 --> 11:47.083
These are for the others.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.502
Try not to draw attention to yourself.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.129
- Because Farouk is watching.
- Farouk?

11:52.296 --> 11:56.425
Yeah, it's a long story.
Just maintain the illusion.

11:56.592 --> 11:57.718
And be ready.

11:57.885 --> 12:01.430
I'll send a signal when I'm in place.

12:39.093 --> 12:41.512
This ought to be interesting.

12:45.808 --> 12:48.436
I'm coming for you, baby.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.176
- David.
- Come--

13:20.342 --> 13:22.636
No.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.486
Oliver.

14:21.445 --> 14:26.450
- Oh. I thought you were--
- Set them along the perimeter.

14:26.617 --> 14:30.454
<i>On the chest of a barmaid in Sale
Were tattooed the prices of ale</i>

14:30.621 --> 14:35.209
<i>And on her behind, for the sake of the blind
Was the same information in Braille</i>

14:35.709 --> 14:37.753
Mm. Mm.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.089
Oliver Bird, dedicated follower of fashion.

14:49.557 --> 14:51.976
Have I seen you before?

14:52.142 --> 14:53.227
At the poetry slam?

14:56.021 --> 14:58.899
- No. Heh. Uh--
- You do seem familiar though.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.901
What did you say your name was again?

15:01.694 --> 15:04.196
No, don't tell me.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.198
I'll remember.

15:07.408 --> 15:09.493
Whoo. What a pickle.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.665
Where did you say that device was,
the, uh, halo?

15:14.832 --> 15:17.626
- Here in my hand.
- Hm.

15:18.669 --> 15:22.881
So you're saying multiphasers....

17:11.407 --> 17:13.200
Melanie?

17:14.576 --> 17:16.495
David?

17:19.415 --> 17:20.916
David.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.419
Melanie!

17:49.862 --> 17:51.363
Shh.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.151
Okay. Oh. You're okay.

18:29.318 --> 18:32.029
You're just in a coffin. It's no big deal.

18:32.196 --> 18:35.449
It's not even a-- It's more of a mental....

18:35.908 --> 18:37.201
It's a mental coffin.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.787
Your body isn't--
It's your mind that's trapped.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.538
Which is....

18:41.705 --> 18:42.706
That's not better.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.501
David.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.086
David. You're freaking out.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.546
- Stop it.
- No, you're not--

18:49.713 --> 18:53.675
Don't tell me I'm trapped in here
with another thing, monster, whatever it is.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.929
No, he's up there, the monster.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.639
He tricked us into giving up control.

18:58.806 --> 19:01.850
- Tricked you.
- What?

19:02.726 --> 19:04.603
Yeah, I got that part.

19:04.770 --> 19:08.232
But if you're not the monster, then....

19:09.650 --> 19:12.069
I'm you, your rational mind.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.154
You're having a breakdown,
a stress response.

19:14.321 --> 19:18.992
Your power is kicking in to save you.
It created me. You did.

19:19.952 --> 19:23.205
- And you're British?
- Like I said, I'm your rational mind.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.834
- And I created you?
- Yes.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.171
To help you find a way out of here before
this thing takes control of our body forever.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.091
Okay, well....

19:34.258 --> 19:35.676
Ha.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.095
Look around, pal.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.806
- We're in a locked coffin underground.
- Right.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.641
- Ahem.
- There is no way out.

19:42.808 --> 19:48.438
Tell me, how can we be underground
when we're not even inside our body?

19:49.439 --> 19:53.485
So if there's no body, and no ground...

19:53.652 --> 19:55.946
...then there's no coffin.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.115
It's just an idea.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.409
That makes sense.

20:00.576 --> 20:02.744
Good. Now, I want you
to imagine a classroom.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.121
A what?

20:04.288 --> 20:07.207
A classroom. With a blackboard.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.043
We're gonna figure this thing out,
you and me.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.754
Once and for all.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.265
Good.

20:23.432 --> 20:24.850
Nice blackboards.

20:25.017 --> 20:27.978
Now, I want you to forget all the tricks...

20:28.145 --> 20:29.855
...the memory work, the MRI.

20:30.022 --> 20:34.610
Forget all the lies. It's your mind.
You know everything the monster knows.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.988
So go back to the beginning.
What have we learned?

20:38.697 --> 20:39.907
I'm adopted.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.826
Good. Write it on the board.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.704
- Really?
- Yeah. You imagined chalk, right?

20:45.871 --> 20:47.247
Well, go on.

20:55.339 --> 20:59.885
Which wedding day--? My parents were....

21:00.052 --> 21:02.471
I don't know what to call them now.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.891
Why didn't they tell me?
Or, Amy, why didn't she...?

21:07.392 --> 21:10.187
Hey, focus. This is about facts.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.522
Fact 1: you're adopted.
What's Fact 2?

21:12.689 --> 21:15.317
What did Lenny say about your father,
your real father?

21:15.484 --> 21:18.153
She said she knew him.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.781
Yes, and before we go further,
let me ask you this.

21:20.948 --> 21:23.492
Do you think that thing up there
is Lenny?

21:24.242 --> 21:25.410
No.

21:25.577 --> 21:26.995
So, what is it?

21:27.162 --> 21:28.205
Uh....

21:28.914 --> 21:30.749
What'd he say, this scientist?

21:30.916 --> 21:32.626
A parasite?

21:32.793 --> 21:35.629
Yes, write it down.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.842
It's not an insect, right?

21:41.009 --> 21:45.389
Not a botfly or a tapeworm. It's a....

21:46.598 --> 21:48.976
Yes, of course.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.936
It's a mutant.

21:51.103 --> 21:52.396
Like me.

21:52.562 --> 21:56.233
And it's been with you a long time,
maybe since you were a...?

21:58.151 --> 21:59.820
A baby.

22:09.955 --> 22:14.543
So okay. I had a dad.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.212
And a mom, I guess, right?

22:18.046 --> 22:23.176
And if Lenny knew him,
then he was probably a mutant like me.

22:23.343 --> 22:27.139
Psychic, I'm guessing. And he....

22:27.305 --> 22:32.185
This thing, the monster, was his enemy.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.563
And they must have fought.

22:35.981 --> 22:38.400
Did they fight with their fists?

22:39.276 --> 22:41.903
Uh, no, they fought here...

22:43.155 --> 22:44.781
...in the astral plane.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.242
With their minds.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.494
And my father-- God, this is so weird.

22:49.661 --> 22:52.581
I don't even know how to picture him. Um....

22:52.748 --> 22:56.626
Screw it. Okay.
My father, he must've won.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.005
And the monster, whatever...

23:00.172 --> 23:05.052
...somehow his mind or his soul
or his being, whatever...

23:05.218 --> 23:06.803
...it didn't die.

23:06.970 --> 23:10.807
But its mind floated off.

23:12.309 --> 23:15.395
Then Dad goes home.

23:15.604 --> 23:18.440
"Sweetheart, it's over.
I won. Give me some sugar."

23:18.648 --> 23:20.942
Is that supposed to be a British accent?

23:21.151 --> 23:23.904
And there's me, I'm born.

23:26.073 --> 23:29.159
And he-- They-- Somehow they decided
to give me away, right?

23:29.367 --> 23:32.370
I mean, did they know?

23:33.580 --> 23:36.833
Or maybe it wasn't....

23:37.375 --> 23:41.296
Maybe it wasn't about the monster.
Maybe they just didn't want me.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.882
Oh, boo-hoo. Come on, focus.

23:44.049 --> 23:46.176
Right. You're right.

23:47.302 --> 23:50.972
- I am pretty, I am loved.
- Good. Keep going.

23:51.556 --> 23:54.976
Let's say for now that Dad...

23:55.185 --> 23:57.771
...was worried it wasn't safe for me...

23:57.938 --> 24:00.732
...so instead, to keep me safe...

24:00.899 --> 24:02.859
...I went to live with
my other mom and dad.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.946
My adopted, in secret....

24:06.988 --> 24:11.493
Somehow, the monster was watching...

24:11.868 --> 24:13.995
...and found me.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.750
<i>And like a haunted house...</i>

24:20.168 --> 24:22.879
- ...it possessed me.
- Why?

24:25.006 --> 24:26.633
Revenge.

24:26.842 --> 24:30.095
- Isn't that what you--? What it said?
- Good. Keep going.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.809
It possessed me.

24:35.976 --> 24:38.353
- And that made me sick.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

24:38.520 --> 24:40.021
And my powers didn't help.

24:40.188 --> 24:45.443
Hearing voices, and seeing--
But this thing made it worse.

24:46.236 --> 24:50.574
And he-- It poisoned me my whole life.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.077
It made me-- It made me crazy.

24:55.162 --> 24:57.122
And it fed on me.

24:57.289 --> 25:01.126
- To what end?
- Power.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.378
It was weak.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.297
But I made it stronger...

25:05.463 --> 25:07.591
...my powers.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.427
And it kept feeding.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.889
Uh, what did Lenny say?

25:14.055 --> 25:17.559
The only being that matters
in the universe is God?

25:17.726 --> 25:22.939
So it fed on me, so that one day, maybe...

25:23.148 --> 25:25.692
...it could get its revenge.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.070
Or worse.

25:31.489 --> 25:35.327
Then Syd came,
and she woke me up.

25:35.493 --> 25:39.664
The monster realized
he couldn't hide anymore, and it--

25:41.082 --> 25:43.084
And here we are.

25:43.251 --> 25:46.171
I mean, not here in this classroom, but....

25:46.755 --> 25:48.423
Where are we again?

25:48.590 --> 25:50.258
Our mind is in the astral plane.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.510
Our body is in our room
from when we were kids...

25:52.677 --> 25:55.055
...with our friends,
and they're in trouble.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.057
Melanie was wrong.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.936
I was sick...

26:01.186 --> 26:03.980
...but I'm not sick anymore.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.899
So, what are you gonna do about it?

26:07.651 --> 26:10.278
I'm gonna get my body back.

26:46.189 --> 26:47.941
Melanie?

26:48.858 --> 26:50.527
David?

27:10.839 --> 27:12.966
No, no.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.137
May I?

27:25.353 --> 27:28.148
Where was I? Oh, yes. Here we go....

34:20.518 --> 34:22.103
David?

34:38.953 --> 34:39.996
Shh.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.090
David.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.642
Kerry.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.188
You okay?

35:47.355 --> 35:48.940
You?

35:51.067 --> 35:52.819
- It's gone.
- No.

35:53.027 --> 35:54.487
No!

35:54.654 --> 35:55.988
It's not gone.

35:56.155 --> 36:00.201
We've isolated it in your mind,
the monster, with the device.

36:00.409 --> 36:03.412
- So leave it on?
- Yes, please.

36:05.623 --> 36:08.042
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:08.793 --> 36:13.214
David, we should-- I really think we should go
to my lab. Tell him, Melanie.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.671
<i>Elevator going down.</i>

37:00.094 --> 37:03.139
How do you feel about beat poetry?

37:04.348 --> 37:08.561
Deliver my sermon to my soul,
and Jack's soul, too...

37:08.728 --> 37:10.646
...and anyone who will listen.

37:10.813 --> 37:12.148
Jack made a mean martini.

37:12.315 --> 37:14.609
I knew a guy called Jack....

37:14.775 --> 37:18.195
Would you like some eggs?
Have a tomato?

37:18.404 --> 37:24.076
<i>To look at the sunset
Over the box house hills and cry</i>

37:24.285 --> 37:28.581
Is that right? Oh, yes. Where was I? Ahem.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.337
<i>You were never no locomotive, Sunflower</i>

37:34.503 --> 37:36.881
<i>You were a sunflower</i>

37:51.479 --> 37:55.066
- This is delicious.
- Mm. Are you gonna eat any sausage?

37:56.275 --> 37:58.361
What about your potatoes?

38:00.154 --> 38:03.699
I know you're not a fan of mealtime.

38:04.492 --> 38:06.369
Did you wanna...?

38:06.953 --> 38:08.454
I'm good.

38:11.207 --> 38:12.917
All right. Did you want something?

38:13.084 --> 38:15.962
There's soup....

38:17.254 --> 38:19.173
You left me.

38:19.924 --> 38:22.718
I needed you and you left me.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.057
<i>Input error. Try again.</i>

38:29.976 --> 38:32.812
<i>Input error. Try again.</i>

38:34.689 --> 38:37.608
<i>Input error. Try again.</i>

38:39.360 --> 38:42.154
<i>Input error. Try again.</i>

38:43.823 --> 38:46.993
<i>Input error. Try again.</i>

38:48.160 --> 38:50.871
<i>Input error. Try--</i>

38:51.747 --> 38:54.083
<i>Excellent choice.</i>

38:55.835 --> 38:58.421
- I'm so...
- No.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.966
- ...sorry.
- Don't. Not here.

39:03.509 --> 39:07.304
I should've told you about the man
and being adopted....

39:07.471 --> 39:09.598
- The man?
- But you were so--

39:09.765 --> 39:14.020
I mean, now I know you weren't sick
and you had this thing inside of you.

39:14.186 --> 39:16.647
And the powers.
David, you have powers.

39:16.814 --> 39:18.941
I know. I'm a mutant.

39:20.609 --> 39:23.821
A mutant. But, no....

39:24.030 --> 39:27.700
You should've come to live with me,
with Ben, with--

39:27.867 --> 39:30.411
Oh, my God. I have to call Ben.

39:30.578 --> 39:32.788
- Amy....
- No, he'll be so worried.

39:32.955 --> 39:36.042
Amy, you can't. They're watching him.
Division 3. If you call him--

39:36.208 --> 39:37.668
- An e-mail--
- David.

39:37.877 --> 39:39.754
I could call from a payphone.

39:40.588 --> 39:42.423
Just get some rest.

39:42.590 --> 39:44.550
We'll figure this out.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.516
Careful.

39:53.142 --> 39:56.020
Don't let it move around too much.
I don't know how stable the connection is.

39:56.187 --> 39:57.646
- Mm.
- Everything okay?

39:57.813 --> 40:00.775
Uh, not really. I think we should
get this out of me, fast.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.526
I don't think it's too happy.

40:03.194 --> 40:06.822
Come on, David,
we need to get you across to my lab.

40:18.167 --> 40:21.003
Did I ever tell you a story
of the Lady and the Crane?

40:21.170 --> 40:24.048
Many times, but tell me again.

40:42.525 --> 40:45.236
David, you look well.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.280
Love that headband.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.658
I know. Me, not so good.

40:50.825 --> 40:53.953
Third degree, thank you very much.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.247
Really painful.

40:56.789 --> 40:59.792
We have so much to talk about.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.545
You can kill the others.
