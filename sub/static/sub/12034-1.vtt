<i>South Hartford 911.
What is your emergency?</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:32.529
<i>This is Lieutenant Dreyfus, badge
number 3525, at 174 Willow Lane.</i>

01:34.527 --> 01:37.872
Now entering what appears to be
the living room.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.611
Living conditions are best described as

01:41.868 --> 01:44.280
being in a state of disarray.
Watch your step.

01:47.907 --> 01:50.410
Kitchen also in a state of disarray.

01:51.244 --> 01:54.248
Approaching the stairwell
where first victim was found.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.927
Note the instrument on the floor.

02:01.754 --> 02:05.429
Victim number one is facing north.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.937
Male, approximately 160 pounds.

02:10.562 --> 02:13.772
Sustained injury to the left temple.

02:16.903 --> 02:17.938
Now entering the basement

02:18.004 --> 02:20.814
where victims number two and three
were found.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.524
Entered the basement of the house.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.863
We find victim number two.

02:35.121 --> 02:38.864
Female, approximately 120 pounds.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.702
Facing west.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.806
In the victim's right hand,
we have religious paraphernalia,

02:45.198 --> 02:46.700
apparently is clutching.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.312
Heading south

02:52.472 --> 02:56.147
we find another instrument on the floor.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.322
We find victim number three.

03:04.651 --> 03:08.326
Male, approximately 210 pounds.

03:09.822 --> 03:12.496
We have trauma to the head.

03:13.326 --> 03:16.830
Apparent strangulation with rope,

03:17.163 --> 03:20.838
which is broken or torn away.

03:21.167 --> 03:24.842
We have blood splattering
against the door.

03:29.175 --> 03:32.748
In the center of the room,
we have a chair.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.519
The right armrest of the chair is broken

03:36.749 --> 03:40.356
with apparent claw marks
from a struggle.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.695
Various straps used for restraint.

04:06.045 --> 04:08.286
<i>WJBP, Channel 11.</i>

04:08.448 --> 04:09.756
A quiet South Hartford community

04:09.816 --> 04:13.628
was leveled by tragedy as
three clergy members were found dead.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.291
At about 11:47 p.m.
on Sunday evening, the 20th,

04:16.356 --> 04:19.701
we received an emergency call
on our 911 line.

04:19.759 --> 04:24.105
<i>At least three bodies were taken out of
this house, two local priests and a nun.</i>

04:24.163 --> 04:26.939
We checked the location for any
other victims and have not found any.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.773
<i>Apparently, Maria Rossi was hosting
a church group meeting at her home.</i>

04:30.837 --> 04:33.511
Our homicide detectives
and our lab people

04:33.573 --> 04:34.677
<i>are conducting their investigation.</i>

04:34.741 --> 04:37.244
<i>Mrs. Rossi was found by police
in a crawl space.</i>

04:37.410 --> 04:39.412
We can't speculate as to what

04:39.646 --> 04:41.148
<i>the cause or the motive may have been.</i>

04:41.247 --> 04:43.090
They are not ruling out any possibilities.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.429
<i>However, at this time,
we don't want to speculate</i>

04:46.486 --> 04:49.399
<i>on what may or may not have been
the cause.</i>

04:53.259 --> 04:55.933
<i>My name is Isabella Rossi</i>

04:56.596 --> 04:58.371
and that was my mother.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.372
<i>The thing you have to understand
about my mother</i>

05:02.702 --> 05:04.375
is that she just had a huge heart.

05:04.937 --> 05:08.942
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.</i>

05:09.275 --> 05:12.119
<i>Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain.</i>

05:13.046 --> 05:16.619
And there we are.
That was actually on my...

05:16.949 --> 05:18.292
Can you see that?

05:19.886 --> 05:21.957
That was my first birthday party.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.131
<i>And I don't think it was until I was</i>

05:24.457 --> 05:28.200
about six years old that
I actually started to notice, you know,

05:28.261 --> 05:30.673
<i>something was different,
her moods were changing.</i>

05:30.730 --> 05:32.232
<i>Then, she went away for a little bit</i>

05:32.298 --> 05:34.278
<i>and when she came back
they said she was better.</i>

05:35.802 --> 05:37.179
But she wasn't.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.639
<i>We couldn't understand
what was happening.</i>

05:39.706 --> 05:41.151
<i>No one had answers.</i>

05:41.474 --> 05:43.647
So why are you doing this film?

05:44.310 --> 05:46.813
Because I really need to

05:47.980 --> 05:51.325
understand what happened.

05:57.156 --> 05:59.602
What Maria Rossi did,
and her subsequent life,

05:59.659 --> 06:02.640
was incredibly tragic and clouded.

06:03.096 --> 06:07.511
And caught in the middle of it
is a daughter who is just now learning

06:07.700 --> 06:09.373
<i>the circumstances of that tragedy.</i>

06:09.669 --> 06:12.013
<i>Isabella, look at the camera, honey.</i>

06:12.672 --> 06:14.948
<i>If someone had asked me</i>

06:15.007 --> 06:19.717
how is it possible for Mrs. Rossi
to have done what she did,

06:19.779 --> 06:23.522
I would have gone through the list
of things that cause human aggression.

06:23.649 --> 06:27.028
Something like major depression,
or schizophrenia,

06:27.086 --> 06:29.430
<i>or dissociative identity disorder.</i>

06:29.489 --> 06:30.763
<i>It's my understanding</i>

06:30.823 --> 06:34.600
that her current psychiatric diagnosis
has been D.I.D.

06:34.660 --> 06:39.040
But this is her seventh different
diagnosis since 1987.

06:39.098 --> 06:42.511
<i>You start wondering, is it in my genes?</i>

06:43.870 --> 06:46.646
You know,
am I going to flip out one day?

06:47.206 --> 06:48.549
<i>Just a matter of time?</i>

06:50.543 --> 06:53.888
Two years after she brutally murdered
three people in her home,

06:53.946 --> 06:55.186
a South Hartford jury

06:55.248 --> 06:58.354
<i>found Maria Rossi not guilty
by reason of insanity.</i>

06:58.584 --> 07:01.497
Rossi was committed
to the South Hartford State Asylum.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.158
<i>And then in September of that year,</i>

07:03.423 --> 07:04.424
<i>my mother was transferred</i>

07:04.490 --> 07:08.267
to the Centrino Mental Hospital
for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.672
<i>I never really questioned why Italy.</i>

07:12.064 --> 07:14.908
When did your father tell you
what really happened?

07:18.070 --> 07:22.416
May 23, 2009. I was 25 years old.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.685
He just said it. He said,

07:26.112 --> 07:30.185
"Mom attacked those people
during an exorcism."

07:31.083 --> 07:33.757
An exorcism performed on her.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.957
It's the job of science to try to sort out

07:36.022 --> 07:38.502
what is a reasonable,
plausible explanation.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.793
But science can't explain everything,

07:40.893 --> 07:42.031
such as a person

07:42.094 --> 07:44.802
levitating two feet off the ground
during an exorcism.

07:46.666 --> 07:50.011
I asked my dad if he thought
she was possessed.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.273
He said he didn't know.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.609
That she was gone. It didn't matter.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.451
Not any more.

08:00.379 --> 08:02.381
He died three days later.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.098
<i>I called the church
where the priests had come from.</i>

08:09.155 --> 08:10.634
<i>And they wouldn't talk about it.</i>

08:10.690 --> 08:13.762
<i>They said they don't have
an ordained exorcist and never did.</i>

08:14.126 --> 08:18.131
So we're on our way to see
the Vatican School for Exorcism.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.472
And to see my mother.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.144
Are you nervous?

08:24.804 --> 08:28.149
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Twenty years is a long time, you know?

08:29.575 --> 08:32.488
<i>So, later, I was contacted
by the Diocese of Rome.</i>

08:32.544 --> 08:36.322
<i>They told me they never authorized
my mother's exorcism.</i>

08:36.649 --> 08:39.823
<i>That's when I knew I had to go to Italy.</i>

08:48.761 --> 08:52.641
I wonder how seriously they take
the exorcism school, you know.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.944
I hope it's not a joke.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.482
Oh, wow.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.493
There it is, St. Peter's Square.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.133
Something like that.

09:25.665 --> 09:29.442
<i>This school has drawn a lot of interest
from all over the world.</i>

09:31.203 --> 09:34.150
<i>Maybe it can help me understand
my mother's situation a little better.</i>

09:34.540 --> 09:38.852
From post-traumatic shock
to serious injury, death even.

09:39.178 --> 09:41.852
And not just for the victim.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.924
Also for the family members,
for anyone in the vicinity,

09:47.019 --> 09:49.021
especially the priest.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.366
<i>Sometimes a person</i>

09:52.758 --> 09:56.365
can be tormented
by more than one demon

09:56.429 --> 09:59.501
in what we call
multiple demonic possession.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.536
These cases are extremely
volatile and dangerous,

10:04.036 --> 10:07.540
and they sometimes
lead to transference,

10:08.207 --> 10:11.552
which means
the demon jumps from one person

10:11.777 --> 10:13.279
to another.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.754
The purpose of the class
is to educate priests

10:18.884 --> 10:20.420
and, of course, laypeople,

10:20.486 --> 10:23.763
about the Devil's presence in their lives,
in modern society.

10:24.156 --> 10:25.965
<i>For example, in Italy alone</i>

10:26.058 --> 10:28.971
<i>there are over 800 satanic cults.
We had a problem.</i>

10:29.028 --> 10:31.030
We needed more exorcists.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.600
<i>If it is possession,
then first and foremost</i>

10:33.666 --> 10:35.543
<i>we must rule out mental illness.</i>

10:35.601 --> 10:37.638
<i>Schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder.</i>

10:37.937 --> 10:41.180
<i>The course is designed
to explore all these conditions.</i>

11:18.811 --> 11:21.485
Okay, anyone, any thoughts on that?

11:21.981 --> 11:24.291
I believe the subject
was clearly possessed.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.159
The subject
spoke in multiple languages.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.764
Come on. Speaking in tongues? Maybe.

11:30.589 --> 11:35.538
Incoherent babbling from
a mentally-disturbed person, certainly.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.933
I'm sorry, Father.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.942
And the subject displayed
abnormal strength

11:38.998 --> 11:42.002
when confronted with holy water,
and while heavily sedated.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.742
The delusional mind
of a paranoid schizophrenic

11:45.037 --> 11:48.211
may actually react to holy water
as if it were,

11:48.274 --> 11:50.880
I don't know, acid, urine.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.287
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to disagree.

11:53.612 --> 11:56.286
The girl fractured her own femur.

11:56.615 --> 12:00.461
Her strength might have been abnormal,
but not impossible.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.030
It's very well known that

12:03.122 --> 12:07.798
some epileptics do break their bones
during a seizure. It's a fact.

12:08.294 --> 12:11.639
As I said, we must be sure to rule out
mental illness.

12:11.964 --> 12:16.310
In the end, this case
could not be proved as possession.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.349
<i>The diversity of the class
was comforting.</i>

12:19.405 --> 12:22.750
<i>It wasn't just priests or nuns,
but regular people,</i>

12:22.808 --> 12:25.482
<i>people who are facing
the same things I'm facing.</i>

12:25.811 --> 12:28.815
<i>People like me,
looking to help someone.</i>

12:29.682 --> 12:30.990
<i>So why are you here?</i>

12:32.651 --> 12:35.063
All this knowledge, you all agree on this,

12:35.121 --> 12:38.125
all this knowledge
is invaluable for us, no?

12:38.557 --> 12:41.333
David, what would you say
drew you to this school?

12:41.393 --> 12:43.566
In particular, to exorcism?

12:44.563 --> 12:48.739
The combination
of science and religion.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.639
I think,
based on my background in medicine,

12:51.704 --> 12:53.741
it gave me a greater sense of purpose.

12:53.806 --> 12:57.845
We all talk so definitively
about God and about the Devil

12:57.910 --> 13:03.861
but we can all agree that there's
no real facts, right? No proofs?

13:04.517 --> 13:07.760
God has never helped me.
What about you?

13:10.923 --> 13:12.425
Sure. Yeah.

13:12.858 --> 13:17.204
So when do you actually witness
an exorcism in class?

13:17.429 --> 13:19.431
This class is all theory.

13:19.765 --> 13:22.109
This is a school of exorcism, is it not?

13:22.434 --> 13:24.710
It's not reality.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.942
Look at the tape we watched today.

13:29.208 --> 13:34.055
That girl fit every criteria for possession
except she wasn't.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.554
It's a mental disorder.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.595
No. When you witness
someone possessed,

13:38.651 --> 13:40.153
you'll know the difference.

13:40.219 --> 13:42.324
You say that like you have.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.369
Have you witnessed a real exorcism,
Father?

13:46.892 --> 13:51.568
Yeah. Right after he saw
the Easter Bunny.

13:51.797 --> 13:54.505
I may have.
Can I ask you something, Isabella?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.046
- Sure.
- I'm curious.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.275
Why are you doing this documentary?

14:02.308 --> 14:04.811
I will be honest. My mom.

14:05.811 --> 14:09.315
When I was about eight years old

14:10.082 --> 14:12.255
she murdered three people.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.597
Members of her church.

14:15.654 --> 14:20.330
I found out that she had committed
these murders during an exorcism.

14:20.659 --> 14:23.663
An exorcism on her.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.842
- See you.
- It was nice meeting you.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.874
Your mother must be at Centrino, right?

14:30.135 --> 14:32.809
- Have you seen her yet?
- Tomorrow.

14:33.038 --> 14:37.282
Okay, well, the class
won't give you the answers you need.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.380
You need to see a real one.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.220
How do you know when it's real?

14:42.481 --> 14:43.653
You know.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.221
Good luck.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.027
Thanks.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.469
That was interesting.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.510
- Hey.
- What are you looking at?

15:02.935 --> 15:06.280
My mother's hospital instruction manual.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.516
Look at this thing, it's huge.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.848
Okay.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.787
So, camera one, two and three.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.515
Which one do I look at?

15:15.581 --> 15:16.889
You don't have to
look directly at the camera.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.459
Right. I knew that.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.493
Remember, the cameras
are always running when the car's on.

15:21.553 --> 15:22.588
Let's go.

15:22.788 --> 15:26.964
You know,
my father received a letter from Rome.

15:27.393 --> 15:31.739
I guess because priests were involved.
The Holy Church got involved as well.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.672
And they said that they wanted to
treat my mother at Centrino.

15:34.733 --> 15:35.905
They called it

15:36.802 --> 15:38.440
an "offering of forgiveness."

15:38.504 --> 15:42.145
And I remember thinking that meant
God was forgiving my mother.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.247
I was young.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.182
Okay.

16:08.434 --> 16:11.108
- No camera.
- Show him the media pass.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.301
<i>It felt like a prison.</i>

16:40.366 --> 16:43.210
An old prison, really.

16:43.502 --> 16:47.917
But Dr. Costa seemed concerned,
so that was good.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.482
Follow me.

16:55.547 --> 16:59.188
I only show you this because your
mother has not had a violent outburst

16:59.251 --> 17:01.026
in over <i>7</i> years.

17:12.231 --> 17:15.838
She's extraordinarily anti-religious.

17:15.934 --> 17:19.608
We refrain from religious items
and discussion at all times.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.348
They can make her hostile.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.246
But I want to put...

17:21.573 --> 17:22.608
That's enough.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.395
That's enough.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.939
I'm not sure if you knew this, doctor,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.565
but my mother was involved
in an exorcism

17:45.631 --> 17:47.201
while she committed those murders.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.336
Did you know that?

17:48.767 --> 17:52.271
Isabella, your mother's case,
although unique,

17:52.604 --> 17:55.141
is not a matter of demonic possession.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.881
It's a matter of brain function.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.789
So why do you think she was transferred
all the way from the States to Rome?

18:02.281 --> 18:06.127
I don't know.
It was before I arrived here.

18:13.058 --> 18:16.130
Unfortunately, we've had to keep her
heavily medicated.

18:16.462 --> 18:20.308
An exhaustive amount of meds,
to be honest.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.475
Antipsychotics.

18:22.801 --> 18:25.475
Sedatives. Anti-anxiety.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.477
It constantly changes.

18:27.806 --> 18:30.810
She is a very, very complex patient.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.671
Miss Rossi, let's keep moving.

18:53.999 --> 18:58.004
She is having a very good day today.
But there still are rules.

18:58.337 --> 19:02.285
Don't talk about faith or God.
And stay passive.

19:02.608 --> 19:07.284
Hostility and aggression are...
Well, they've provoked her in the past.

19:11.783 --> 19:14.457
Just precautions. It will be fine.

19:14.686 --> 19:18.532
In fact, there is a very good chance
she won't even recognize you.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.135
Maria?

19:24.796 --> 19:26.469
You have a visitor.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.719
Come. Come.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.252
Hi, Mom.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.856
I like your drawings.

20:24.022 --> 20:28.596
Maria, I'd like to speak with you
if you'd let me, please.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.931
My name is Isabella.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.442
Isabella Rossi.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.712
I'm your daughter.

20:51.283 --> 20:54.127
I just haven't seen you in a long time.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.125
Connect the cuts.

20:59.291 --> 21:03.296
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.302
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.305
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.580
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

21:16.642 --> 21:19.816
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.652
Do you recognize this?

21:29.087 --> 21:31.499
Do you know how to connect the cuts?

21:33.325 --> 21:35.430
I don't know what that means.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.833
Connect the cuts.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.836
Did you do that to yourself?

21:49.007 --> 21:50.145
Please stop.

21:53.111 --> 21:57.116
Maria, I came a very long way
to see you.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.063
Do you want to see my painting?

22:01.720 --> 22:04.530
Yes. I'd like that. I'd love that.

22:14.900 --> 22:19.576
Yes, yes. Maria, he was your husband.
You loved him very much.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.008
Do you remember?

22:25.077 --> 22:26.579
Who are you?

22:26.845 --> 22:30.315
I'm Isabella. I'm your daughter.

22:30.382 --> 22:33.454
- I don't have a daughter.
- Yes, yes, you do.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.657
We just haven't seen each other
in a very long time.

22:35.721 --> 22:38.224
I don't have a daughter.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.069
Do I?

22:45.897 --> 22:48.070
Why? Why?

22:49.334 --> 22:50.904
Why not?

22:53.238 --> 22:57.584
Well, thank you for coming.
Please say hello to your family from me.

22:57.909 --> 23:01.880
Have a nice day. Thank you for coming.
I have to go. I have to go.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.690
I have to get ready. I have to get ready.

23:05.584 --> 23:08.360
I have to get ready. Get ready.

23:08.587 --> 23:11.431
Get ready.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.369
You shouldn't have killed.

23:19.765 --> 23:21.210
What did you say?

23:22.434 --> 23:26.439
Maria, please. I don't have a lot of time.
Please, tell me something.

23:30.142 --> 23:33.146
You shouldn't have killed your child.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.224
What?

24:01.573 --> 24:04.986
It's against God's will, you know.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.758
Out, out, out!

24:21.827 --> 24:24.671
Shit, that was great.
That was great stuff.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.168
Are you all right?

24:30.836 --> 24:32.179
Isabella?

24:32.971 --> 24:34.138
Isabella, I...

25:00.699 --> 25:03.475
<i>What's it like, losing both parents?</i>

25:05.704 --> 25:08.708
<i>It feels empty.</i>

25:10.742 --> 25:13.416
<i>Like there's no safety net
to fall back on.</i>

25:13.879 --> 25:16.052
<i>And it forces you to be resilient.</i>

25:16.214 --> 25:19.627
<i>Possession and exorcism
have dictated my life.</i>

25:20.051 --> 25:23.225
<i>It took my mom
and it basically killed my dad.</i>

25:23.555 --> 25:25.330
<i>It defines me now.</i>

25:25.891 --> 25:28.235
<i>I mean, here I am.</i>

25:28.293 --> 25:31.831
<i>I flew halfway across...
You know, halfway across the world.</i>

25:31.897 --> 25:34.503
<i>To see this woman
who I never thought I'd see again.</i>

25:35.233 --> 25:37.076
<i>I don't like that it defines me.</i>

25:38.203 --> 25:41.776
<i>I contacted Father Ben Rawlings
and David Keane</i>

25:41.840 --> 25:45.117
<i>in hopes that they would review
the footage of my mother.</i>

25:46.378 --> 25:48.790
Luckily, they agreed
and invited me to their loft.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.737
Isabella, hi, welcome.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.067
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.174
It's hard to say
why I wanted to be a priest.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.747
<i>Maybe I was drawn to helping people.</i>

26:16.408 --> 26:21.721
<i>I think that duality exists within all of
us and, occasionally, it can take form.</i>

26:22.314 --> 26:26.820
<i>Science can no longer help,
and religion has to take over.</i>

26:27.319 --> 26:29.959
Which can be really difficult
for people to accept.

26:30.121 --> 26:33.227
Isabella, nice to see you again.
How are you? You okay? Okay, great.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.064
- Can I get you a cup of tea or anything?
- Sure.

26:36.127 --> 26:38.471
I'm sorry, I forgot your...

26:38.797 --> 26:40.174
- Michael.
- Michael.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.779
My family were always very religious.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.816
My mother and father,
they were teachers,

26:46.905 --> 26:50.352
but I was closest to my uncle.
He was a priest.

26:51.743 --> 26:55.748
<i>By the time I was 13,
he told me that he was an exorcist.</i>

26:55.981 --> 26:57.654
<i>And, well,</i>

26:59.317 --> 27:00.990
if you can imagine...

27:01.987 --> 27:05.662
It's like, I suppose, you know,
you being told that

27:06.324 --> 27:08.167
your dad is Superman.

27:08.493 --> 27:11.667
That's what it felt like to me.
That he was in direct,

27:12.664 --> 27:15.611
you know, war, I suppose,
with the Devil.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.748
And, I don't know,
it blew me away, really.

27:21.606 --> 27:26.248
<i>And so, he took me along with him
and by the time I was 18,</i>

27:26.311 --> 27:29.349
I'd seen four exorcisms.
I'd even assisted on one.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.821
And it just changes you.

27:33.184 --> 27:35.994
<i>Unfortunately, he passed away
a couple years ago.</i>

27:36.221 --> 27:39.998
Anyway, when I was 23,
I went into the priesthood.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.731
And by the time I was 27,
I was an ordained exorcist.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.678
<i>But I'll tell you this.</i>

27:50.235 --> 27:52.909
After all the years
that I've been in the Church

27:53.171 --> 27:55.845
I've seen the Devil
way more than I've seen God.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.484
That's just not the way
it's supposed to be.

28:01.146 --> 28:03.524
There, what did she say to you there?

28:05.050 --> 28:07.792
Yeah, at the end there,
she started remembering things,

28:07.852 --> 28:10.696
specific things,
and she said something to me.

28:10.922 --> 28:12.924
But I'm not sure if she said...

28:13.191 --> 28:14.693
What? What was it?

28:17.195 --> 28:19.869
I terminated a pregnancy
about four years ago.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.442
The doctor said
I couldn't carry it to term, so...

28:22.701 --> 28:25.705
Anyway, she knew about it,
and she said that...

28:26.037 --> 28:31.043
Something about
being against God's will or something.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.287
Hang on. Let's just look at that.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.556
It's against God's will, you know.

28:36.781 --> 28:37.851
That means something, right?

28:37.916 --> 28:41.363
Possibly. You said you had a copy
of her medical charts?

28:41.586 --> 28:42.894
What are those?

28:44.689 --> 28:46.066
She cuts herself.

28:46.124 --> 28:48.468
Those are crosses, Ben.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.405
Crosses? Wait, wouldn't she
not want crosses if she's possessed?

28:52.497 --> 28:54.272
- Not necessarily.
- Look at them. Look at them.

28:54.332 --> 28:56.812
The way that she's seeing them,
they're upside down.

28:56.901 --> 29:01.077
They're inverted crosses.
They're typically used in Satanic rituals.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.417
- I don't have a daughter.
- Wait, is she speaking with an accent?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.251
Yeah, she did that some. Why?

29:06.311 --> 29:08.313
Different accents
can be like speaking in tongues.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.552
The pregnancy,
did you tell her about that at all?

29:11.616 --> 29:12.651
No.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.752
And you're absolutely sure

29:13.818 --> 29:16.025
there's no other way
she could have found out?

29:16.087 --> 29:18.158
I mean, there's no way.

29:18.490 --> 29:22.063
See, there are basically four factors

29:22.127 --> 29:25.939
when it comes to
determining demonic possession.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.170
One, unnatural strength.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.174
You got aversion to holy objects.

29:31.503 --> 29:34.245
Languages or events
that they could not have known.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.182
And preternatural movement,

29:36.441 --> 29:40.981
which is basically
objects moving around the room.

29:42.413 --> 29:46.225
So, strength? No. Languages, no.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.958
Preternatural movement, no.
Aversion to holy objects, maybe.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.728
Yeah, but there are accents
and, Ben, she knew that information.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.633
Yeah, that interests me.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.704
We need to show you something.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.711
Okay. Can I bring the camera?

30:08.473 --> 30:10.350
- Sure.
- All right.

30:10.542 --> 30:11.543
Okay.

30:12.210 --> 30:15.054
- Can I bring this?
- Yeah, of course. Come on through.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.990
I'm good. I'm right behind you.
Keep going.

30:24.222 --> 30:27.226
What is all this? Who are these people?

30:27.559 --> 30:30.506
These are people
the Church turned down for exorcism.

30:30.728 --> 30:35.074
- And they're all possessed?
- We believe they are.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.246
These two cases are resolved.
Those two are open

30:38.503 --> 30:40.744
and we're almost done with this one.

30:41.005 --> 30:44.680
This is the girl, Rosa, right?
From the video we saw in Gallo's class?

30:44.742 --> 30:46.415
You both thought she was possessed.

30:46.477 --> 30:49.424
She is.
We think the Church made a mistake.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.485
So correct me if I'm wrong,

30:55.420 --> 30:59.766
but you guys are performing
these exorcisms yourselves,

31:00.091 --> 31:02.196
without the Church's permission?

31:02.760 --> 31:06.765
That's right. We have to. Otherwise,
these people would continue to suffer.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.577
What is all that?

31:09.234 --> 31:11.680
We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.

31:10.735 --> 31:13.181
We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.444
Yeah, go ahead.

31:14.505 --> 31:17.349
That's a camera we use
to determine pupil dilation,

31:17.408 --> 31:20.082
which is very important
in cases of possession.

31:20.345 --> 31:23.417
Nine millimeters
is as large as the average pupil gets.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.627
Maybe 10 or 11
under certain substances

31:25.683 --> 31:28.027
like cocaine, psilocybin,
methamphetamines.

31:28.253 --> 31:30.699
Anything above 11
is considered preternatural.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.697
Why doesn't the Church
help these people?

31:32.757 --> 31:34.100
You see, that's just it.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.934
The Church isn't in the business
of healing people.

31:37.195 --> 31:38.538
The bureaucracy won't allow it.

31:38.763 --> 31:41.937
Their hands are tied. In 1999,
the Church changed the exorcism rites

31:42.000 --> 31:44.378
for the first time in almost 400 years.

31:44.435 --> 31:46.346
Now a priest has to be
absolutely certain

31:46.404 --> 31:49.647
that there's an evil presence
in order to even attempt an exorcism.

31:49.707 --> 31:52.381
And that's a near impossible task,
because a lot of the time

31:52.610 --> 31:55.989
it takes an exorcism
for a demon to reveal itself.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.823
But rather than get distracted
by the Church's hypocrisy,

31:58.950 --> 32:00.896
we're going to
continue to care for these people.

32:00.985 --> 32:02.987
So that means that my mother's case
can actually be something...

32:03.054 --> 32:04.362
No, no. Isabella, you...

32:04.722 --> 32:06.998
The Church will never pursue
your mother's case

32:07.091 --> 32:08.832
because the last time someone did,
people died.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.830
What do you suggest?

32:11.095 --> 32:12.699
If you really want to help your mother,

32:12.764 --> 32:15.005
you need a better understanding
of exorcism.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.212
A real understanding.

32:18.102 --> 32:22.380
Okay. So take more classes
and maybe show Gallo the tape?

32:22.440 --> 32:27.617
Isabella, you'll learn more
in five minutes of an exorcism

32:27.679 --> 32:30.626
than you will
in three months in some class.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.227
Plus, you'll get to know
the real difference

32:32.283 --> 32:34.923
between possession and mental illness.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.134
So witness a real exorcism?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.202
With you?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.140
If you want.

32:54.372 --> 32:58.286
So the exorcism rites,
when they were updated,

32:58.343 --> 33:00.118
what exactly changed?

33:00.378 --> 33:03.723
Well, for one, all media coverage
of exorcisms were banned.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.155
Not that they were filmed much anyway.

33:06.384 --> 33:09.160
Exorcisms can take minutes
or they can take years.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.563
No two are the same.

33:13.057 --> 33:15.401
Is this thing we're doing even legal?

33:16.227 --> 33:18.173
No. Not exactly.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.974
You never know what's going to happen.

33:39.917 --> 33:42.261
So do you still get nervous or...

33:45.590 --> 33:47.194
No, not really.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.872
Demons, like angels, have orders,

33:49.927 --> 33:51.998
or spheres, to be more specific.
A hierarchy, basically.

33:52.764 --> 33:56.041
<i>Now, it's imperative you get the demon
to reveal itself so you can deduce</i>

33:56.100 --> 33:57.670
its rank in that hierarchy.

33:58.603 --> 33:59.946
<i>In our last session</i>

34:00.204 --> 34:01.945
we were able to hone in
on our demon's identity.

34:02.006 --> 34:03.076
His name is Berith.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.982
Look, I know we went over this before.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.114
Keep us between you and her, okay.
I'm not kidding.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.487
All right, all right.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.199
- Father.
- How is she?

34:27.065 --> 34:30.409
- She's worse? Okay, let me see.
- No, no.

34:31.302 --> 34:35.808
We had to move her downstairs.
To the basement.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.750
The basement?

34:41.112 --> 34:42.455
This is it.

34:43.214 --> 34:47.025
We're actually going to see a person
who is supposedly possessed.

34:47.552 --> 34:50.590
So I guess now we'll see
if it's bullshit or not.

34:59.564 --> 35:00.907
She's in here.

35:02.066 --> 35:03.409
Michael, come in.

35:02.066 --> 35:03.909
Everyone, bow their heads.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.412
Everyone, bow their heads.

35:08.573 --> 35:12.578
May the Lord bless us and keep us.
May the Lord let His face shine upon us.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.553
May the Lord lift up His countenance
onto us and give us peace.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.859
- Amen.
- Amen.

35:57.855 --> 36:00.199
This really is no place for her,
Mrs. Sorlini.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.302
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
We don't know what to do.

36:03.361 --> 36:06.171
Please, please, it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

36:07.298 --> 36:08.470
Rosa?

36:25.483 --> 36:30.489
Bless you for your prayers.
You must leave her to us now. All right?

36:30.721 --> 36:31.722
Yes, Father.

36:31.989 --> 36:34.993
This is to help loosen her limbs,
keep her calm.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.903
It's very similar to a muscle relaxant.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.569
She's looking right at me.

37:19.870 --> 37:20.871
Okay.

37:22.940 --> 37:23.941
Okay.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.213
Let's get set up.

37:51.569 --> 37:54.140
It's best just to stay close
to Michael, okay?

37:55.573 --> 37:58.417
- A little to the right.
- No, no. It's set.

38:06.984 --> 38:09.157
It is Thursday, December 3, 2009.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.422
Subject, Rosa Sorlini.

38:11.656 --> 38:14.830
Last session, November 13, 2009.

38:15.159 --> 38:18.834
Rosa's appearance has worsened,
skin color and weight.

38:19.263 --> 38:21.504
Temperament appears stable.

38:21.832 --> 38:25.837
Vitals are slightly elevated,
but basically normal.

38:26.671 --> 38:30.847
Her pupils are dilated
to approximately nine millimeters.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.011
Okay.

38:35.846 --> 38:37.189
Let's begin.

38:44.188 --> 38:45.531
Pupils still normal.

38:45.790 --> 38:48.361
Rosa, are you in there?
Can you hear me?

38:48.859 --> 38:51.305
I want to know
how you're feeling today, Rosa.

38:57.735 --> 39:01.547
I remember last time, Rosa,
you were strong. You spoke to me.

39:07.178 --> 39:11.183
No, no, she's strong.
And getting stronger than...

39:13.417 --> 39:14.760
You don't want this one any more.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.592
It's no good for you.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.699
She said my name. She said my name.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.605
- How did she know my name?
- Stay back. Don't listen to her.

39:28.332 --> 39:32.803
Five minutes alone with her,
I promise you, her cunt will know me.

39:34.171 --> 39:36.173
I want you to leave the girl out of this.

39:38.409 --> 39:43.085
I know who you are, demon!
Your name is Berith!

39:43.748 --> 39:45.750
Behold the Cross of the Lord.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.090
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

39:48.419 --> 39:49.921
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.931
God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

39:52.022 --> 39:53.262
I appeal to Your Holy Name

39:53.324 --> 39:55.565
that you graciously
grant me help against...

40:05.202 --> 40:07.045
That you graciously grant me help

40:07.271 --> 40:09.342
against this unclean spirit
that's tormenting this creature of Yours!

40:09.407 --> 40:11.011
Ben, she's hemorrhaging!

40:11.075 --> 40:13.214
God, creator and defender
of the human race,

40:13.277 --> 40:14.654
who made man in Your own image,

40:14.712 --> 40:17.192
look down in pity on this, Your servant!

40:18.149 --> 40:19.924
Help me hold her down, Ben.
Ben, help me hold her down.

40:19.984 --> 40:23.727
Taste it, bitch!
Come taste your mother's sweet milk!

40:23.788 --> 40:24.892
Stay back.

40:28.292 --> 40:29.635
Inserting anti-coagulant.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.133
...overwhelms it with fear and panic.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.543
Repel, O Lord, the Devil's power.

40:35.599 --> 40:38.273
Break asunder his snares.
You can't hide, Berith!

40:42.239 --> 40:44.651
The Mystery of the Cross
commands you!

40:44.975 --> 40:48.479
Blood pressure's way up, 190 over 110!
Come on, hang in there!

40:49.313 --> 40:53.591
Heart rate's up. So is blood pressure.
190 over 110. Hang in there.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.339
Blood pressure's going crazy!
It's 220 over 110! Say it, Ben!

41:06.497 --> 41:08.602
St. Barnabas commands you!

41:09.166 --> 41:11.407
- Ben?
- Just keep hold of her!

41:15.172 --> 41:16.674
Ben, I can't hold her!

41:19.176 --> 41:21.520
- Oh, my God! Where is she?
- David! David!

41:21.579 --> 41:23.752
I can't see! I need light! I need light.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.030
Do something!

41:30.688 --> 41:32.167
Get her back on the bed! Ben!

41:33.858 --> 41:35.701
- Get her legs.
- Michael, get away.

41:38.696 --> 41:43.202
I'll carve out your diseased heart
and eat it!

41:43.467 --> 41:47.813
I have a whole army of angels
and the Lord Almighty by my side!

41:50.541 --> 41:53.044
You want pain? I'll give you pain!

41:53.377 --> 41:55.550
St. Barnabas commands you!

41:55.813 --> 41:58.657
From whose sight you are not hidden!

41:58.716 --> 42:00.696
St. Barnabas commands you!

42:01.051 --> 42:03.224
St. Barnabas commands you!

42:03.821 --> 42:06.062
You foul, treacherous beast!

42:06.390 --> 42:10.065
Give way to Christ,
in whom you found none of your works!

42:10.394 --> 42:12.897
Bow down before God!

42:19.570 --> 42:21.140
Okay, bring her back on her legs.

42:25.175 --> 42:26.586
She's stabilizing.

42:25.175 --> 42:26.779
She's stabilizing.

42:25.175 --> 42:26.677
Turn that off. Yeah.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.182
She's stabilizing.

42:27.578 --> 42:29.080
Turn that off. Yeah.

42:39.256 --> 42:40.758
Turn that off. Yeah.

42:55.873 --> 42:57.546
I don't know what to say.

43:02.880 --> 43:05.224
Right there, right there,
you see how her pupil is normal again?

43:05.282 --> 43:06.488
That indicates that she's clean.

43:06.550 --> 43:08.496
Now that you have this,
now you can tell the Church, right,

43:08.619 --> 43:10.064
- That you saved her?
- No.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.794
Yeah, it worked. But that doesn't mean
the Church will support it.

43:13.057 --> 43:15.230
That doesn't make any sense. Why not?

43:15.459 --> 43:16.802
Because...

43:17.895 --> 43:21.069
Because the Church would have us
arrested and deported.

43:21.131 --> 43:23.338
What we're doing in the eyes of
the Church is very wrong.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.243
That's why we know it's so right.

43:29.573 --> 43:31.951
Look, her appearance
is completely normal,

43:32.009 --> 43:33.317
and so quickly after the exorcism.

43:33.377 --> 43:36.324
Hello? This is she. Excuse me.

43:36.981 --> 43:38.324
R-O-S-S-I.

43:38.582 --> 43:39.993
- What's that?
- I don't know.

43:41.986 --> 43:44.489
I'm her daughter.
I just got here from America.

43:44.989 --> 43:48.937
I think that's a big mistake. We could
go back to the charts, you'll see that...

43:48.993 --> 43:50.336
This is amazing.

43:50.494 --> 43:51.837
Thank you.

43:55.666 --> 44:00.513
That was the Diocese of Rome.
I asked for a reevaluation of my mother.

44:00.771 --> 44:01.772
What did they say?

44:02.006 --> 44:03.713
They thanked me for my concerns

44:03.774 --> 44:08.450
and said that any interference would
probably jeopardize her well-being.

44:09.279 --> 44:12.783
And that God would be watching us
over these trying times.

44:13.017 --> 44:14.360
Are you all right?

44:16.520 --> 44:17.863
Fine.

44:19.523 --> 44:21.366
I can't believe
the Church turned her down.

44:21.625 --> 44:23.127
Of course they're gonna turn it down.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.534
...go straight to Dr. Costa
with my own doctor, like David.

44:26.797 --> 44:29.107
The hospital
is outside Vatican City walls,

44:29.166 --> 44:31.203
and I think that means
it's out of their jurisdiction.

44:31.468 --> 44:33.812
- What are you two talking about?
- What's that?

44:34.138 --> 44:36.140
What are you talking about?

44:36.807 --> 44:39.151
- Okay. Okay.
- We need to talk.

44:39.476 --> 44:41.649
- David? Do you have a sec? Okay.
- Yeah.

44:42.479 --> 44:44.356
We don't know what's wrong
with Isabella's mother.

44:44.415 --> 44:47.624
Nobody does because she hasn't been
evaluated in over 15 years.

44:47.818 --> 44:49.820
She deserves a second opinion.

44:50.054 --> 44:51.192
A second opinion?

44:51.255 --> 44:52.996
It would give us enough time
to determine her condition.

44:53.057 --> 44:55.435
No, you want to give an exorcism
to Isabella's mother.

44:55.492 --> 44:56.596
That's not what we're saying.

44:56.660 --> 44:59.231
We just need time and we need to know
that she's actually possessed.

44:59.296 --> 45:01.105
Yeah, then she can get
the proper attention.

45:01.165 --> 45:02.735
Look, okay, that's not how this works.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.837
You're here to document,
you're not here to get involved.

45:04.902 --> 45:06.438
- First of all, it's illegal.
- No, it's not illegal.

45:06.570 --> 45:08.607
Yes, Ben, it is!
And in the eyes of the Church...

45:08.672 --> 45:10.049
You know, forget about the Church,
David!

45:10.107 --> 45:11.745
Why does it always come down to that?

45:11.842 --> 45:14.721
What if this works?
What if we find out that it's not D.I.D.?

45:14.912 --> 45:16.357
Yeah, think about it, David.
This could work.

45:16.413 --> 45:17.687
Michael, I know what you're doing.

45:17.748 --> 45:20.058
I know it would be provocative
for your film, but we will be arrested.

45:23.754 --> 45:25.563
How would it even work?

45:25.622 --> 45:28.102
As soon as they found out what we
were doing, they'd shut us down.

45:28.225 --> 45:30.865
The staff won't be allowed with us
in the room.

45:30.928 --> 45:35.104
Yeah, we should have that right
to privacy on her behalf, right?

45:36.433 --> 45:38.435
Yeah, you're right.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.885
David, just...

45:46.443 --> 45:48.787
What if it was your own mother?

45:55.052 --> 45:56.395
I'm really nervous.

45:55.052 --> 45:58.397
I'm an active priest
in good standing with the Holy See.

45:56.653 --> 45:59.998
I'm an active priest
in good standing with the Holy See.

46:00.224 --> 46:03.637
And regardless of the outcome,
the Church will find out,

46:03.694 --> 46:05.605
and it will put my job in jeopardy.

46:05.829 --> 46:06.830
Father Ben Rawlings.

46:06.997 --> 46:07.998
<i>But at the same time,</i>

46:08.232 --> 46:09.609
there are problems
within this institution.

46:09.666 --> 46:11.043
There are things that I don't agree with.

46:11.335 --> 46:13.178
<i>In the case of Maria Rossi,</i>

46:13.403 --> 46:16.077
<i>I think we should take the time
to actively deduce whether or not</i>

46:16.140 --> 46:18.643
she's being tormented
by an evil presence.

46:20.911 --> 46:22.254
I think.

46:23.347 --> 46:26.157
<i>What's the Church's stance
on Maria Rossi?</i>

46:26.316 --> 46:28.762
Well, she's faded into the system.

46:28.819 --> 46:30.765
She's pumped full of drugs
and forgotten.

46:31.188 --> 46:36.194
If she becomes too difficult,
there's a panic button on the wall.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.203
- Yeah?
- Yes, I saw that. Thank you.

46:38.362 --> 46:42.435
The bottom line here is that something
horrible happened back in 1989.

46:42.699 --> 46:44.406
And it wasn't Maria Rossi's fault.

46:44.468 --> 46:48.280
You'll be screening her using SCID-D?
Two hours?

46:48.338 --> 46:50.784
More or less two hours, yeah. I'd say so.

46:50.974 --> 46:53.079
I feel the Church needs to change.

46:53.310 --> 46:58.191
<i>We're so eager to just brush things
under the carpet as if they don't exist.</i>

46:58.515 --> 47:01.655
<i>I don't fit in this Church,
in this guise of the Church.</i>

47:01.919 --> 47:04.160
And I have to do what I believe.

47:04.488 --> 47:05.660
<i>I'll see you soon, Maria.</i>

47:09.893 --> 47:11.804
<i>I know it's dangerous,
and it might not even work.</i>

47:12.296 --> 47:15.300
But I can't just sit back and do nothing.

47:23.140 --> 47:24.676
Okay, not a problem.

47:28.946 --> 47:34.157
The time is 8:32 a.m.
on Monday, December 7, 2009.

47:34.218 --> 47:37.461
Subject is Maria Rossi. Session one.

47:38.622 --> 47:40.863
Subject appears docile.

47:41.124 --> 47:42.967
Heavily medicated.

47:45.462 --> 47:49.842
Pupils are mildly dilated
due to the medication.

47:50.467 --> 47:52.344
Okay. Let's wake her up.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.545
When she wakes up,
we'll see if she gets a reaction.

47:58.141 --> 47:59.814
Counteracting medication.

48:01.311 --> 48:04.053
Medication should take effect
in 20 seconds.

48:04.548 --> 48:07.154
- So this is when you provoke her?
- Exactly.

48:08.051 --> 48:09.724
Ten seconds.

48:12.556 --> 48:16.129
Five, four, three,

48:16.560 --> 48:19.404
two, time.

48:21.164 --> 48:22.199
Maria?

48:25.736 --> 48:27.579
Maria, do you know what this is?

48:31.408 --> 48:33.752
Maria, is there someone
in there with you?

48:34.845 --> 48:36.256
I don't know.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.920
Yes, you do, Maria.

48:39.516 --> 48:40.859
Who's in there?

48:41.084 --> 48:43.587
We can help you.
We can free you from it.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.525
EKG is normal.

48:46.423 --> 48:48.096
They'll be angry.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.196
There's more than one?

48:59.703 --> 49:01.205
Maybe she's clean.

49:04.207 --> 49:05.584
What was that?

49:05.909 --> 49:07.252
Yeah, we got something.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.725
Her pupil's still normal.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.295
It's nothing.

49:20.924 --> 49:22.267
Is she all right?

49:22.592 --> 49:23.935
Yeah, she...

49:26.430 --> 49:28.103
She's sleeping.

49:28.365 --> 49:32.074
That's the first time
I've seen a possessed person

49:32.803 --> 49:36.148
fall asleep when confronted by
a priest and holy water.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.077
What does that mean?

49:39.643 --> 49:41.714
I don't know. I think...

49:43.547 --> 49:44.992
I think we might be wasting our time.

49:45.048 --> 49:48.257
I came here for her and I'm going to do
everything I can to help her.

49:48.318 --> 49:51.925
This isn't consistent with any form
of possession that I've ever seen.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.468
I'm sorry, Isabella. This...

50:00.230 --> 50:01.732
Her pupils are almost fully dilated!

50:01.798 --> 50:03.778
Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!

50:03.834 --> 50:05.438
- What are you doing?
- We're helping her, David!

50:05.502 --> 50:06.640
We need to help her!

50:06.703 --> 50:08.910
- Ben, this is not the time or the place!
- Stay back.

50:09.039 --> 50:10.177
I need you to calm down.

50:10.640 --> 50:12.313
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.

50:12.609 --> 50:14.020
- Christ, hear us.
- Christ, please hear us.

50:14.277 --> 50:16.314
God, the Father in Heaven.

50:17.447 --> 50:20.360
I know you! I know you, little girl!

50:20.550 --> 50:21.620
God, the Father in Heaven.

50:21.685 --> 50:22.891
God, the Father in Heaven,
most merciful.

50:22.953 --> 50:24.523
God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

50:24.588 --> 50:25.965
I appeal to Your Holy Name.

50:26.189 --> 50:28.430
- Against this unclean spirit!
- I know you!

50:34.498 --> 50:38.844
Shove that needle in your fucking eye,
you faggot!

50:41.204 --> 50:44.151
I adjure you, ancient serpent

50:45.976 --> 50:48.980
by the judge of the living
and of the dead.

50:49.079 --> 50:50.922
- Don't get too close.
- By your Creator...

50:50.981 --> 50:53.222
- Ben? Ben?
- Michael!

50:53.550 --> 50:55.996
The faith of the holy apostles
and of all the saints commands you,

50:56.053 --> 50:57.964
- Reveal yourself before the Creator!
- Watch it!

50:59.589 --> 51:00.659
David!

51:00.724 --> 51:03.796
The devout prayers of holy men...

51:04.127 --> 51:06.129
God the Father commands you!

51:06.296 --> 51:09.470
You can't get back
in your God's good graces, priest.

51:09.800 --> 51:12.212
Not after what you did.

51:16.473 --> 51:19.147
- Ben, what are you doing?
- Her vitals are going crazy.

51:24.214 --> 51:25.386
Get back. Get back.

51:25.882 --> 51:27.725
Michael, put the camera down and help!

51:27.984 --> 51:28.985
I want to help her!

51:29.319 --> 51:30.992
Get her leg! Get her leg!

51:32.956 --> 51:34.833
Careful. Grab her leg!

51:35.225 --> 51:37.000
I got her. Get her arm.

51:39.062 --> 51:40.735
Isabella, is it locked?

51:40.997 --> 51:43.238
- Close the bolt!
- Yes! Yes!

51:46.870 --> 51:48.042
Tell me your name, coward!

51:48.238 --> 51:49.239
Asbeel!

51:51.708 --> 51:55.155
Come that close to me one more time
and I'll use your tongue

51:55.212 --> 51:59.786
to skull fuck the baby killer over there!

52:01.251 --> 52:06.633
<i>The itsy bitsy spider
came down the water spout.</i>

52:07.424 --> 52:12.430
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.</i>

52:12.896 --> 52:14.273
<i>Out came the sun...</i>

52:14.331 --> 52:17.335
Isabella, don't listen to it.
It's not your mother.

52:17.767 --> 52:19.747
- Come on, baby.
- Isabella, it's not your mother!

52:19.803 --> 52:21.248
You know the words.

52:21.438 --> 52:23.111
Isabella, snap out of it!

52:23.607 --> 52:24.984
- Do it!
- Demons!

52:24.985 --> 52:27.111
You are guilty
before our Lord Jesus Christ.

52:28.044 --> 52:31.548
You are guilty
before our Lord Jesus Christ

52:31.781 --> 52:34.057
whom you dared to nail upon the cross.

52:34.284 --> 52:37.458
Pulse is 284. Rhythm is way off.

52:39.289 --> 52:40.734
I'm not like the others, demon!

52:40.891 --> 52:42.234
Do you hear me, transgressor?

52:42.392 --> 52:43.962
- I hear you, priest.
- Seducer!

52:44.127 --> 52:47.074
All you fucking do is talk!

52:48.231 --> 52:51.405
The holy apostles Peter and Paul
and all the saints command you.

52:51.635 --> 52:55.640
Give way to Christ,
in whom you found none of your works!

52:55.972 --> 52:58.976
For it is not He who condemns you,

52:59.042 --> 53:01.989
but rather He
who rules the living and the dead.

53:02.245 --> 53:04.316
Our Father, who art in heaven...

53:04.581 --> 53:08.256
- No, it's gonna kill her!
- Just stay there, Isabella.

53:10.921 --> 53:11.922
No, no, no.

53:13.423 --> 53:16.029
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,

53:16.326 --> 53:17.862
for ever and ever. Amen.

53:18.395 --> 53:21.035
Let my mother go.

53:23.967 --> 53:25.310
You'll burn.

53:26.836 --> 53:28.838
You'll burn eternal.

53:30.607 --> 53:32.450
Poor child.

53:41.017 --> 53:44.226
- Please, open this door now!
- Pulse is dropping.

53:44.621 --> 53:47.033
Maria? Maria, can you hear us?

53:47.290 --> 53:51.966
Starting to regain consciousness.
Temp is returning to normal.

53:57.467 --> 53:58.502
Over.

54:02.339 --> 54:04.341
<i>- Tell me your name, coward!
- Asbeel!</i>

54:07.210 --> 54:09.053
I'll be feeling that tomorrow.

54:09.246 --> 54:12.159
See, this is preternatural movement
right here.

54:12.215 --> 54:13.888
I've seen it before,
but I've never captured it on tape.

54:14.150 --> 54:15.652
So, what does that mean?

54:15.885 --> 54:19.662
It means we've got
everything that we need right here.

54:19.990 --> 54:21.833
This is huge, Isabella.

54:23.393 --> 54:24.497
Let's play it again.

54:25.228 --> 54:27.401
Do you realize how big this is?

54:27.664 --> 54:28.665
With the evidence we've got,

54:28.732 --> 54:30.678
the Holy See has to see us.
They have to.

54:30.900 --> 54:32.538
We can go to the press with this

54:32.602 --> 54:35.583
and in an instant, we'd have
1,000 people standing out there.

54:35.839 --> 54:39.013
Our priority right now
should be getting her back to the States.

54:39.509 --> 54:41.511
The endorsement of Dr. Costa is vital.

54:41.745 --> 54:45.090
But after the results that he saw,
there's no way that he can't agree.

54:45.348 --> 54:47.851
Dr. Costa doesn't believe
that she was possessed or anything.

54:47.917 --> 54:51.091
He thinks it was an exercise
that shocked her system.

54:51.521 --> 54:53.523
Anyway, it doesn't matter
what he believes

54:53.590 --> 54:56.400
because his referral's actually gonna
help us get her back to the States.

54:56.526 --> 55:01.236
<i>You can't get back
in your God's good graces, priest.</i>

55:01.364 --> 55:02.707
What are you doing?

55:04.601 --> 55:06.274
I'm just...

55:07.370 --> 55:11.216
I'm just analyzing Maria's audio.

55:11.274 --> 55:15.916
I'm just trying to work out if there is
more than one voice inside her.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.223
See, there can...

55:21.217 --> 55:24.721
See? See? Right there. You hear that?

55:27.557 --> 55:30.401
- She's speaking in tongues, right?
- No, no.

55:30.894 --> 55:35.400
It's one sentence, spoken in
more than one language, I think.

55:35.632 --> 55:37.634
I'm just trying to isolate how many.

55:43.940 --> 55:47.319
<i>You wanted him to die, didn't you?</i>

55:47.644 --> 55:48.987
Ben, what is she talking about?

55:49.112 --> 55:51.456
<i>You wanted him to die, didn't you?</i>

55:51.815 --> 55:54.659
Is she talking about your uncle?

56:00.490 --> 56:03.869
I found four voices on the recording.
I found four voices on the recording.

56:03.927 --> 56:05.998
- You found four?
- Wait, what does that mean?

56:06.162 --> 56:09.769
It means that the entity
in your mother had disciples.

56:09.999 --> 56:11.706
We call it multiple demonic possession.

56:11.768 --> 56:14.874
You might have heard
Gallo talking about it in class.

56:14.938 --> 56:17.282
Wait, so it's a powerful demon.

56:17.607 --> 56:19.609
Yeah. It's a beast.

56:22.011 --> 56:24.116
- What?
- You know how lucky we are?

56:24.447 --> 56:29.294
Look, we're gonna deliver all our
findings to the Holy See next Friday.

56:29.352 --> 56:30.729
Yeah, maybe.
He hasn't agreed to see us.

56:30.787 --> 56:33.028
Yeah, well, have you told him that
the press might be interested?

56:33.089 --> 56:34.568
That's not very diplomatic.

56:34.624 --> 56:36.695
Can't we just wait a little bit
till my mother's case is resolved?

56:36.760 --> 56:37.898
I mean, the press?

56:37.961 --> 56:40.635
Hang on a minute. Just because
you've got what you want now,

56:40.697 --> 56:43.644
you're expecting us just to keep quiet?
Michael, please, just get...

56:43.700 --> 56:45.407
Stop! Stop! That's not what I meant!

56:45.468 --> 56:47.778
Because there are lot more
people to help

56:47.837 --> 56:49.316
rather than just your mother, okay?

56:49.372 --> 56:51.545
- Wait, did Father Gallo call you?
- What's your problem?

56:52.976 --> 56:54.319
No. You?

56:54.544 --> 56:56.148
Yeah, he called me twice.

56:59.215 --> 57:00.523
What did he say?

57:00.583 --> 57:02.995
He wants to help us
make the right decision.

57:03.052 --> 57:05.498
He's worried about us.
Especially, he's worried about me.

57:05.555 --> 57:07.899
- You? Why?
- Because of my job, Ben.

57:09.492 --> 57:11.665
David, what are you doing
with the papers? Are you okay?

57:11.895 --> 57:14.671
I'm fine. The conversation's just
giving me a little bit of a headache.

57:14.731 --> 57:17.041
David, he's just trying to scare you.
That's all.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.135
- Is that blood?
- He's a moral man.

57:18.201 --> 57:20.044
And he's toeing the company line
on this one and you know it.

57:20.103 --> 57:21.776
Is your nose bleeding?

57:22.071 --> 57:24.745
David, you got something.
Are you okay?

57:25.241 --> 57:28.415
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.

57:34.751 --> 57:35.923
Look.

57:36.586 --> 57:37.758
I'm sorry.

57:39.255 --> 57:41.132
It's probably stress.

57:41.191 --> 57:43.899
- It's a lot of work to do for Friday.
- Yeah.

57:48.865 --> 57:50.299
Are you all right?

57:57.040 --> 57:58.519
- They won't release her.
- What?

57:58.775 --> 58:00.914
- Why not?
- I don't know. They won't say.

58:01.144 --> 58:03.988
They can't or won't believe
that she's better.

58:10.053 --> 58:11.498
- Where are my keys?
- I don't...

58:13.389 --> 58:15.391
Where are my fucking keys?
They were right here.

58:15.458 --> 58:17.631
- I don't know. Relax.
- Where are my fucking keys, Michael?

58:18.127 --> 58:20.801
I don't know.
It feels like they'll never release her.

58:23.833 --> 58:27.178
There's no way
the Church can't see this.

58:27.237 --> 58:30.810
I can look them in the eye and tell them
that it was the right thing to do.

58:45.355 --> 58:48.165
This is what they do.
They cover things up, they ignore it,

58:48.591 --> 58:50.366
no matter who it hurts or destroys.

58:50.426 --> 58:52.531
Well, not this time.
Not this fucking time.

58:52.595 --> 58:55.701
This was supposed to be
about my mother. Not anybody else.

58:55.765 --> 58:59.042
Not about Ben's ego, or David's job.

58:59.102 --> 59:03.949
I have a sinking feeling I'm going to be
excommunicated for all this. I think.

59:05.008 --> 59:06.316
For what we did.

59:06.476 --> 59:08.353
David's inner coward
is really coming out.

59:08.511 --> 59:10.752
Ben and David, maybe I get them.

59:11.114 --> 59:14.618
They have their own thing going on,
but Isabella,

59:15.285 --> 59:16.286
we started this together.

59:16.519 --> 59:19.022
Michael just has to stop.

59:19.522 --> 59:20.865
He just wants to...

59:21.124 --> 59:24.196
They have this group of three

59:24.260 --> 59:27.605
and I'm like
the annoying guy with the camera.

59:36.873 --> 59:39.547
David, what the fuck are you doing?

59:41.077 --> 59:42.522
If it weren't for me

59:42.745 --> 59:45.316
no one would know anything
about what the hell they're doing

59:45.381 --> 59:48.919
in their Church and in their basements.

59:49.752 --> 59:53.165
Look, I really think we need to talk
about some stuff.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:14.287
- What's wrong with the camera?
- I don't know. Just...

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:15.646
What's wrong?

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:18.022
- Not then. Before she hit you.
- Michael, did you see anything?

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.219
No, I didn't see anything.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.520
- Okay, we'll just try another...
- This is something else.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.487
Yeah, but it's at the exact same time.

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:27.729
It must have been just a power surge
through the hospital.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.030
It's the only thing I can think of.

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:31.299
For all the cameras?
It could be something else.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.500
- Hey, we're filming.
- I'm sorry.

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.406
- David, you have to see this.
- I have to go.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.977
- I said we're filming.
- I know. I heard you. I got to go.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:40.407
What's the matter?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:43.610
- The bishop denied our request.
- What?

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:48.479
It's just a bloody meeting.
What was the reason?

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.585
The incident's under investigation.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.953
- Well, of course it is.
- David...

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.028
- David.
- Yeah?

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:58.458
- It's going to be okay. All right?
- I hope so.

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:01.568
- I hope so.
- David, wait, wait.

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.661
I'm coming with you, remember?
The baptism?

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:05.137
Come on. Let's go.

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.903
- Michael, how long is this going to take?
- Just a second.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:11.138
- Do we really need this?
- Yep.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.748
- Are you okay with that, David?
- I'm fine. You ready?

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:18.441
<i>Baptism, baptism.</i>

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:22.620
Baptism is the transferal of sins,

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.619
<i>both original and personal.</i>

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:27.625
<i>Now, for example,</i>

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:31.693
<i>if a baby were to die
after being baptized</i>

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.456
it would go to Heaven.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.130
And if before

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.971
it would go to Hell.

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:44.635
<i>In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:49.344
Brethren, our fair Father Christ
in His great loving kindness

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:52.579
hath ordained that His mystic bride,
the Holy Mother of the Church,

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:56.053
to protect her children at every stage
from the cradle to the grave.

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:59.283
And to this end is the Sacrament
of Holy Baptism ordained.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.892
Amen.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.567
John Thomas,
in the name of Christ our Lord

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:12.739
I anoint thee with oil for thy safekeeping.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.754
John Thomas,

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.923
I baptize you

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:40.257
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.763
and of the Holy Spirit.

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.967
David? What's he doing?

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:52.469
David!

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:53.978
- Father, stop.
- Please stop!

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:55.807
What are you doing, David?

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.316
David, stop, stop!

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.152
David! For God's sake!

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.514
Somebody, stop him!

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.093
You know what I'd like to do?

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.163
I'd like to take this fucking camera,

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:19.265
turn it around
and stick it in Michael's face.

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:24.842
I'd like to ask him,
"What was it like, Michael?"

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.846
"What was it like when"

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:33.178
"your mom fucked
your father's best friend?"

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.522
David?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.729
Hey, David!

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:55.467
Michael, what's wrong with David?
What's happened?

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.371
What's going on?

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.217
The...

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.887
The kid almost died.

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:14.388
What?

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.858
What happened? What did you say?

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:22.400
The baby he was baptizing,
he almost drowned it.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.098
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the camera.

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:30.007
- No, wait. Just leave the camera.
- Is the baby okay?

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:31.738
Yeah, I think so.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:34.106
You think so? Did you see it?
Were you there or not?

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.581
Do I think the baby's okay? Yeah.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.511
Is he in trouble?

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:40.317
I don't know.
They called the police and he just left.

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.219
- David!
- Okay, just come back when you...

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:47.751
Well, he's been acting strange all day.
Did you see it happen?

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:52.589
See it? I filmed it! It
was like he lost it!

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:57.432
He's been under a lot of stress lately,
so maybe that contributed to...

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.364
I don't know.
You should have been there.

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:01.430
It was like he was crazy!

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.233
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.334
No, of course not!

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.441
- David!
- David?

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:08.571
What the hell's going on?

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.379
Michael, get the camera.
We need the light.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.816
- Ben?
- David?

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:19.619
David?

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:24.620
What's he doing up there?

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:38.305
Watch. Careful.

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.477
- What the hell is all this?
- I don't know.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.917
Ben, are those Bible pages?

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.456
- Oh, Jesus.
- David!

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:54.888
Come here. What have you done?

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.453
Oh, my God, Ben.
He's bleeding all over.

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:59.022
Get his arms up.
Put them up. Put them up.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.499
- No, no, no.
- What is it?

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:03.696
No, no, no.

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:09.309
- What do we do, Ben?
- I don't know!

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:10.810
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.277
I don't know what to do!

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:14.804
Where's...

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:23.517
Go, go, go! Get out! Stay out!

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.785
Stay downstairs!
Don't come back upstairs again!

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:26.950
Just stay down there!

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.859
- Okay, okay.
- Look at me. Look in my eyes.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.057
Michael, did you see his eyes?
Did you see his eyes?

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.621
Shit!

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:34.857
No, no.

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:38.536
Father Keane?
Where is Father David Keane?

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.571
- He's upstairs.
- He's very, very sick.

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:43.043
- Turn on the lights.
- I can't.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.942
This is the only light we have.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.170
- Are you David Keane?
- No, no.

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:50.577
He's upstairs, he's upstairs,
but it's not safe to go up there!

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.016
Stay down here, please!

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.747
Holy shit.

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.253
Do you need the light?

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:07.260
David!

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.778
- He took your gun?
- Yes, he took my gun!

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:20.836
We need to get out right now.

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.780
All of us need to get out. We need to...

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.548
David? David?

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.342
David?

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.283
He's my friend!

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:33.454
David? David, listen to me.
Put down the gun.

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:37.359
- Just put down the gun, yeah?
- David...

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:40.798
Listen to me. It's Ben, okay?
It's your friend.

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.597
- No, no!
- Be quiet, Isabella.

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:46.930
David, listen to me, all right?

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:50.534
This isn't you.
Just listen to my voice, okay?

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.135
This is your friend, Ben.

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:55.805
This isn't you.

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.407
Something else
has taken control of you.

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.920
You know this. You know this.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.546
Okay?

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:07.287
Focus on my voice.
You need to trust me, David. Okay?

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.619
Just stay calm.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:14.625
I can't stop. I can't stop it, Ben!

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:18.337
You can, you can fight it.
Just fight it! Fight it, David.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:22.002
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:24.004
hallowed be Thy name.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:28.008
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth...

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:36.479
I forgot it.

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.023
- Just give me the gun.
- I forgot it.

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:41.350
He says to say, "Thank you".

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:44.529
Jesus!

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.522
The light!

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.667
Come here, come here. Oh, shit.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.037
Fuck!

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.542
I need an ambulance now!

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.375
What's wrong with her?

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.809
She's having a seizure. Come here.

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.046
You saw his eyes, right?

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:15.220
- Ben!
- I saw his eyes!

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:16.728
- Tell me what's happening, Ben!
- I don't want to...

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:17.991
I got to know what's happening, Ben!

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:19.991
Maybe there's some

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.328
transference.

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:24.060
Demonic transference?

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.232
Of course I mean demonic transference,
Michael!

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:28.839
- Transference like?
- Just fucking...

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:31.705
- Michael, please just shut the fuck up!
- Don't you fucking yell at me, Ben!

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.608
Of course I'm gonna fucking yell at you!

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.511
You've been here
the whole fucking time!

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.411
Have you not listened to me?

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.416
Jesus.

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:46.090
No, no! Please, wait here.
Wait out there! Yes, please.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:12.408
Her name is Isabella Rossi.

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:14.920
Can we see her yet?

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:44.873
I believe there's transference.

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:50.185
- I don't know. Not for certain.
- Who are you talking to?

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:56.060
More than one. Four, possibly.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:03.465
Okay, okay. I'll bring her to you
as soon as I can, Father Gallo.

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:04.896
Thank you.

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:10.474
Yeah, I know. It's David's fault.

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:15.409
The doctor asked me to talk to you, yes.
She's doing much better, your friend.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:17.877
She's stable and she's resting,
so I suggest you go.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.317
When can we see her?

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.987
She's gonna be here overnight,
so you can see her tomorrow.

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:23.250
Overnight? That's not possible.

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:24.655
Why is that?

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:27.919
There's something wrong with her.
It's not safe here.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.020
No, this is very safe, I assure you.

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:31.120
Something's wrong with her.

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:32.756
We need to get her
out of here right now.

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:33.925
No, gentlemen, we are extremely...

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:37.163
Do you know
who Father Robert Gallo is?

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:40.399
Father Gallo, yes, I know him,
but I don't understand...

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.269
Isabella?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.001
Isabella?

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.288
What do we do, Ben?

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.683
Isabella, listen to me!

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.824
We need to get her out of here now!

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:18.706
Michael!

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:22.209
I've got her now!

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.049
We need to get her under control!

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:29.349
Help me, please!

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:33.718
I know this woman.
She needs to be sedated. Do it, now!

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:38.555
Jesus will bring your plans to nothing.
Christ will have none of your plans.

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:41.498
Let's take this outside.

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.064
Michael, put the camera down!

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:52.338
Listen to me. I'm a priest.
Please, go and help those people.

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.574
- Keep her here.
- Thank you, Father.

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:58.412
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:02.881
- Come on.
- She just killed that woman.

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:04.952
We need to end this.

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:09.356
Grab her legs. Help me grab her legs!
We're going to Father Gallo's.

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:10.757
What's he going to do?

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:13.525
I need help with the exorcism.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.433
Get the door. Get the door.

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:18.031
Oh, my God. What have I done?

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.763
You really think Gallo's going to help?

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:21.439
Yeah, I need help.

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.600
I need to fix this.

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:26.212
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. She's waking up.

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.037
She's waking up.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:31.278
We haven't got much time, Michael.
We haven't got much time.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.712
Stay with me. Don't let it get to you.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:38.447
When I was 13,
my uncle told me he was an exorcist.

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:42.019
You can't get back
into God's good graces, priest.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.722
Not after what you did.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.455
Ben?

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.496
You wanted him to die, didn't you?

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:49.162
What is she doing?

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:51.801
He says to say, "Thank you."

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:53.796
Who are you?

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:57.300
You know me. Everyone knows me.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:14:00.273
Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:02.474
God the Father!

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:05.407
Oh. My God!

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:07.844
Oh, shit!

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:12.023
Your place is in solitude!

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:15.188
Your abode is in the nest of serpents!

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.355
Be gone forthwith
from this servant of God!

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:20.233
Get out of her! Get out of her!

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.373
It's working, right?

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.633
I have got her under control,
but I don't know for how long.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.077
You've got to hurry up.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.941
It's okay.

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:43.186
It's going to be okay. I'm sorry.

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.283
Just be strong.

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.191
Be strong.

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.027
Just be strong.

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.189
Michael!
