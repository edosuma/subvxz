WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:04.091
Previously onSalvation...Oh, my God, you're pregnant.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.049
Who's the father?He's dead.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.050
Dylan Edwards.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.225
I'm here for you, Grace.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.618
Till the end.

00:09.661 --> 00:10.749
Whatever happens.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.100
Behold the savior
of the human race.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.102
The solar sail
and rail gun projects

00:15.145 --> 00:16.625
are now fully operational.

00:16.668 --> 00:17.974
Did you get what I asked for?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.541
I told you.
Darius really has a plan.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.456
You've done the world a
great service, Jillian.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.501
LIAM:
This group, COPE?

00:23.545 --> 00:26.113
I think they're a suicide cult.
And Jillian's with them.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.940
GRACE: My pregnant daughter
is in there.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.553
Stop! That's my mom.Don't shoot!

00:31.596 --> 00:32.989
I'm unarmed, I
just want to talk.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.078
I'm gonna need you
to let me walk out of here

00:35.122 --> 00:37.254
with Detective Carter
and my daughter.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.734
I am asking you,
please.
Go.

00:38.777 --> 00:41.258
She stays with us.
ZOE:
No.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.130
No, it's okay. I want to stay.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.696
Agent. What do we know?

00:44.740 --> 00:45.741
We got most of them,
Mr. Secretary.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.351
What about Jillian Hayes?

00:47.395 --> 00:49.484
She's gone, along with their
apparent ringleader, Nora.

00:49.527 --> 00:52.269
Mr. President, I'm sorry.
Bass Shepherd has disappeared.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.097
And we have nothing.That's Nate,

00:54.141 --> 00:56.099
Jillian's friend,
the guy who brought her to COPE.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.101
Listen to me, Rosetta.
The rail gun may be in danger.

00:58.145 --> 01:01.104
You need to get
everyone out of there.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.150
This is a good thing.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.238
STENDAHL:
Dear God.

01:06.675 --> 01:09.025
LIAM: We still have 58 days to knock that bloody space rock

01:09.069 --> 01:10.287
off its course.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.202
I do have one last card
left to play.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.986
And it's the greatest
Hail Mary of them all.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.163
We're gonna burn our lifeboat.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.043
In the wake
of the rail gun sabotage

01:27.087 --> 01:30.177
which destroyed Earth's best
hope at stopping the asteroid,

01:30.220 --> 01:33.397
The Tanz administration's
tenuous grip on order

01:33.441 --> 01:35.225
seems to be slipping away.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.018
With looming
food and gas shortages,

01:46.062 --> 01:48.586
the government has announced
a rationing system--

01:48.630 --> 01:51.285
a currency crisis unlike
anything we've ever seen.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.243
MAN:
Take them all. Take it!

01:57.247 --> 01:58.509
The White House has classified

01:58.553 --> 02:00.685
the rail gun disaster
as an act of terror.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.296
Which it clearly is.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.298
An act of genocide
against the human race.

02:04.341 --> 02:07.692
I mean, why would anyone
deliberately blow up

02:07.736 --> 02:09.216
our best shot at survival?

02:09.259 --> 02:12.523
Why would anyone want
to condemn humanity?

02:12.567 --> 02:14.699
ANCHOR:
I think that's the question
on everyone's mind here, Sam.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.788
SAM: In other news,
President Tanz addressed

02:16.832 --> 02:19.313
the nation last night, insisting
that measures are still underway

02:19.356 --> 02:22.490
to divert the asteroid, but at
this point, one has to wonder

02:22.533 --> 02:24.013
why anyone would believe him.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.323
Come in.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.542
We need to talk.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.372
Think you might need this.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.721
I take it
it's bad news.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.158
Good news and bad news.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.203
The good news is we
have one last chance

02:40.247 --> 02:41.813
to save the planet--

02:41.857 --> 02:44.207
a plan I will begin
to oversee immediately.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.688
The bad news?
Take a seat.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.217
It's all yours.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.005
GRACE:
How many dead?

03:00.049 --> 03:01.659
And how many injured?

03:01.703 --> 03:04.140
I understand that, but as of
this moment, the National Guard

03:04.184 --> 03:08.318
is still under the command
of your governor. Yeah,

03:08.362 --> 03:10.842
I will bring it up with the
president as soon as I get him.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.845
Run at a bank
turned into a riot.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.196
At least seven dead,
another 35 injured.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.850
I-I got a list of chaos
as long as my arm, and I can't

03:18.894 --> 03:21.462
get five uninterrupted minutes
with Darius.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.246
Well, you can have
all day with him now.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.727
But he can't solve any
of those problems anymore.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.859
I take it

03:27.903 --> 03:29.470
he didn't consult with
you about this first?

03:29.513 --> 03:32.386
Darius? Consult with his senior
advisor before he resigns

03:32.429 --> 03:33.691
the highest office
in the land?

03:33.735 --> 03:35.258
You're hilarious.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.781
Private citizen Tanz
at your service

03:36.825 --> 03:39.219
effective 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.872
A little advance notice
would've been nice.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.527
Sorry. Things are moving fast.
We need to move faster.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.270
I have no choice.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.577
I have to focus
all my attention on plan B.

03:49.620 --> 03:53.145
Well, make that plan C, since
plan B just blew up. Grace.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.886
I need you to put
the new president up to speed.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.366
Harris, I need you to restore
order in a country

03:56.410 --> 03:58.281
in the middle of a meltdown.Whoa, hold on.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.283
You want to let us in
on this plan C?

04:00.327 --> 04:03.330
In very rudimentary terms,
we're gonna take

04:03.373 --> 04:06.246
a giant rocket ship,
bulk up its mass, and...

04:06.289 --> 04:07.464
ram it into the asteroid.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.074
And if saving ourselves
was that simple,

04:09.118 --> 04:10.554
why didn't we
do this before?

04:10.598 --> 04:12.817
I'm sorry, when did you hear me
use the word "simple"?

04:12.861 --> 04:14.254
But it's-it's viable.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.299
Situation's not ideal,
but t-there's enough time

04:16.343 --> 04:18.997
to make it work.

04:19.041 --> 04:22.392
And I will.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.352
You believe him?

04:25.395 --> 04:28.877
I want to.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.488
Look, we need to prepare, Grace,
for the worst.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.664
I can't...We're facing

04:33.708 --> 04:36.101
tidal waves, firestorms,
impact winter.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.712
You have Zoe,

04:37.755 --> 04:39.714
we have a future grandchild.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.890
None of Darius's other plans
have worked.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.065
It's not his fault
some doomsday cult

04:43.108 --> 04:44.675
decided to blow up the rail gun.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.634
I'm not assigning blame,
I'm calculating the odds,

04:46.677 --> 04:48.853
and considering how
we might beat them.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.681
We need our own plan C.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.826
BASS:
They will blame us

05:04.869 --> 05:07.437
because they are corrupt.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.526
And what
do corrupt governments do?

05:09.570 --> 05:12.703
They peddle lies,
and they give false hope.

05:12.747 --> 05:16.359
The failure of the rail gun
was inevitable,

05:16.403 --> 05:18.361
and ordained.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.928
But the government
needs a scapegoat

05:19.971 --> 05:21.408
on which to blame
their ineptitude,

05:21.451 --> 05:23.453
and because they do not
understand us,

05:23.497 --> 05:26.369
they will demonize us
for accepting the truth:

05:26.413 --> 05:29.633
that they are the liars

05:29.677 --> 05:32.723
and Darius Tanz
is the false prophet.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.770
The rail gun was never gonna
stop the asteroid. He knew that.

05:35.813 --> 05:39.251
Yet, he wanted to keep us
enslaved by the possibility.

05:39.295 --> 05:43.038
But now, we are free.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.996
Why?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.651
Because we accept.ALL: We accept.

05:47.695 --> 05:52.003
This world is coming to an end.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.658
No one can alter
the course of destiny,

05:54.702 --> 05:57.400
but we can prepare for it.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.402
And we have.

05:59.446 --> 06:02.405
I have selected you,
my children,

06:02.449 --> 06:07.236
and I have very big plans
for you in these coming days.

06:10.457 --> 06:14.461
Jillian? Come in.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.463
You look troubled.

06:16.506 --> 06:19.117
Something on your mind?

06:19.161 --> 06:21.729
Where's Nate?

06:23.644 --> 06:26.603
Nate accepted what was.

06:26.647 --> 06:27.909
He's at peace now.

06:27.952 --> 06:31.434
He's dead, isn't he?

06:31.478 --> 06:33.654
Celebration Day.
You destroyed the rail gun.

06:33.697 --> 06:34.916
No.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.397
You did.

06:37.440 --> 06:42.140
You, you gave us
the plans, Jillian.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.926
You brought them to me.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.102
That was your role.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.930
And you accepted it.Because you said

06:48.973 --> 06:51.236
you wanted to bring others hope.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.674
You lied to me.
Or else I never would've...

06:53.717 --> 06:56.154
But you did.

06:56.198 --> 06:59.593
That was your role, and
you need to accept that.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.641
And now
you're one of us.

07:04.685 --> 07:08.689
Till the end. Right?

07:10.604 --> 07:12.606
I am.

07:17.741 --> 07:20.048
DARIUS:
There she is. Our way out.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.006
Tess, play the simulation.TESS: Yes, Darius.

07:22.050 --> 07:25.923
There's our friend Samson,
and there's our other friend,

07:25.967 --> 07:28.448
the gravity tractor, where
the solar sail will dock itself

07:28.491 --> 07:30.145
in a matter of days.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.799
Now, in conjunction
with the solar sail,

07:31.842 --> 07:34.366
we use the force of the rocket
the nudge the asteroid

07:34.410 --> 07:38.632
off course ever so slightly,
but just enough-- hopefully--

07:38.675 --> 07:40.372
to miss the Earth.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.505
So we're gonna turn the Ark
into a battering ram.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.507
A kinetic impactor of sorts.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.467
Yes. Consider it an understudy
for the rail gun.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.685
ALYCIA: Well, everyone
knows that understudies

07:48.729 --> 07:50.513
aren't as good
as the real thing.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.515
Doesn't mean
they can't do the job.

07:52.559 --> 07:55.518
Salvationis the largest
spacecraft ever built,

07:55.562 --> 07:57.520
and the only one that can have
a substantial enough impact

07:57.564 --> 07:59.696
with the limited amount
of time we have left.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.829
Okay, so why didn't we just
do this in the first place?

08:01.872 --> 08:04.353
'Cause it's a Hail Mary,

08:04.396 --> 08:07.138
a silver bullet
with zero margin for error.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.227
But it can work.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.751
LIAM: Okay, but the ship's mass
isn't great enough

08:10.794 --> 08:13.493
to make a dent.Which is why

08:13.536 --> 08:15.538
we're gonna load her up
with depleted uranium slugs.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.061
As for how we're gonna
get her up there,

08:17.105 --> 08:19.150
we're gonna need
teams working

08:19.194 --> 08:22.153
around the clock to retrofit
the rocket with EmDrives.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.547
To account for the additional
mass and the required velocity.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.767
Questions?

08:26.810 --> 08:28.725
Good. We're gonna
fast-track this.

08:28.769 --> 08:30.553
Nessa, Roger, oversee production

08:30.597 --> 08:32.381
and installation
of the EmDrive.

08:32.424 --> 08:33.643
Alycia, you and Liam...

08:33.687 --> 08:35.471
LIAM:
Track the orbital trajectory.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.995
Hey, Darius.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.693
The Ark, it's supposed to be

08:39.736 --> 08:41.216
humanity's
life insurance policy.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.523
Yes, well, there's been
a change of circumstances.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.874
We're gonna have to terminate
the policy to save the patient.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.397
There's only 53 days
left until impact.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.226
You actually believe
this can work?

08:51.269 --> 08:54.664
It has to, or we're done for.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.981
♪

09:21.299 --> 09:24.389
How many people will this hold?

09:24.433 --> 09:25.913
It depends on how comfortable
you want to be.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.176
How much is this bunker?

09:28.219 --> 09:30.613
Tell you what.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.616
Make me an offer.

09:44.235 --> 09:47.195
Is this serious?
Because you're a little short.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.327
And we're no longer accepting
offers in dollars anymore.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.765
Dollars are about
to be toilet paper.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.767
Unfortunately,
we're only taking hard assets.

09:53.810 --> 09:56.291
Medicine, guns, fuel.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.336
Gold. Do you have any gold?GRACE: Uh,
I'm sorry.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.688
Who has truckloads of guns
and medicine laying around?

10:01.731 --> 10:05.343
Mr. Secretary, uh, forgive me
for stating the obvious,

10:05.387 --> 10:07.781
but between Raven Rock
and other accommodations

10:07.824 --> 10:09.347
set aside
for cabinet members,

10:09.391 --> 10:11.436
why would you strike out
on your own?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.351
You have a place to go,
for free.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.360
Harris, why didn't you tell me?

10:22.404 --> 10:24.449
You already have a spot in
a government survival bunker.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.450
You have to take it.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.452
I'm not going without you.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.585
I said we're
in this together

10:29.629 --> 10:31.195
until the end,
and I meant it, Grace.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.415
I don't care about me.
I just want Zoe to be safe.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.026
Even if it means putting her
in a bunker with ten strangers.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.028
Yeah, well, Zoe may not
agree with you there.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.030
Well,

10:40.074 --> 10:42.772
our assets are worthless,

10:42.816 --> 10:45.035
everything's full
or unaffordable.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.124
What's our plan C?

10:49.692 --> 10:52.086
I'll take care of this.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.393
I promise.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.883
DARIUS:
So it's a trade-off

11:06.927 --> 11:08.668
between mass and velocity.

11:08.711 --> 11:11.845
We want to change
the trajectory of the asteroid.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.977
Which depends on
how hard we hit it.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.501
Which depends on the velocity
and the mass of the Ark.

11:16.545 --> 11:20.680
Our job is to find
the right balance.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.159
That's the math.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.900
I want you to track the impact

11:23.944 --> 11:25.510
of the rail gun slugs
we launched.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.077
They should be reaching
the asteroid within hours.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.297
That should give us some intel.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.779
Now comes the hard part.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.911
I thought that
was the hard part.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.087
We need to refit the Ark
with three EmDrives

11:37.131 --> 11:38.349
for additional velocity.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.351
You've built it once,
just do it again.

11:40.395 --> 11:44.791
No, that's not the problem.
It's the icosahedrite.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.793
Icosa

11:46.836 --> 11:48.359
To make our
first EmDrive,

11:48.403 --> 11:50.361
we needed a material
to line the engine nozzle

11:50.405 --> 11:51.928
that would collimate
the microwaves,

11:51.972 --> 11:54.365
and we managed to get this
tiny piece of an icosahedrite,

11:54.409 --> 11:56.977
but only by robbing his
dear, sweet Uncle Nick.

11:57.020 --> 12:01.808
Who deals in rare minerals
and coups and murder.

12:01.851 --> 12:04.462
There must be somewhere else
we can get it.

12:04.506 --> 12:07.117
It's a specific mineral
found in a meteor,

12:07.161 --> 12:09.424
and in fact, one-of-a-kind
meteor, actually.

12:09.467 --> 12:12.035
And my uncle has the only source
of it on this planet.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.516
Great. Why don't we
just steal it again?

12:14.559 --> 12:16.779
He was smart enough after
the first time to move it.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.434
Question is...

12:19.477 --> 12:21.262
where?

12:24.352 --> 12:26.615
Uh, this is Zoe Barrows.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.748
I want to make an appointment
to see the doctor.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.447
I'm pregnant,

12:32.490 --> 12:35.711
and I want to consider
my options.

12:43.893 --> 12:47.505
You must be pretty desperate
to darken my door.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.596
Checkmate.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.253
The game.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.430
In exchange for
the icosahedrite,

12:59.474 --> 13:02.433
your Ark, I want it.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.958
That's not on the table.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.263
Half of those seats are mine.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.657
The Ark's not an option anymore,

13:08.700 --> 13:09.919
not for you at least.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.660
What is that supposed to mean?

13:11.703 --> 13:15.403
With the rail gun gone,
I'll need Salvationto step in.

13:15.446 --> 13:19.363
You're going to crash her
into the asteroid.

13:19.407 --> 13:22.366
Hmm? With a little boost

13:22.410 --> 13:23.628
from your EmDrives.

13:23.672 --> 13:26.066
It'll work.
It won't work!

13:26.109 --> 13:27.632
Darius!

13:29.504 --> 13:31.593
You will be blowing up

13:31.636 --> 13:35.945
the one chance that some of us
have of getting off this planet.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.469
Need I remind you

13:38.513 --> 13:41.211
that Tanz is half mine,
the Ark is half mine.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.214
I am the only one with access
to the launch code.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.869
No way in hell I'll
ever give it to you.

13:46.913 --> 13:50.960
That Ark is the answer
to saving the planet.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.006
Not you.

13:53.049 --> 13:56.966
You have one choice,
Uncle, just one.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.838
Die here,

13:58.881 --> 14:00.665
in this prison cell,

14:00.709 --> 14:02.667
or give me what I want.

14:02.711 --> 14:05.583
I want my freedom, then.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.455
Out of this cell,

14:07.498 --> 14:10.110
all charges dropped.

14:13.243 --> 14:16.507
Give me five hours,
and you will have

14:16.551 --> 14:19.119
your icosahedrite.

14:24.559 --> 14:29.172
You are never to contact
Grace Barrows

14:29.216 --> 14:30.957
or her daughter again,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.394
so help me,

14:33.437 --> 14:35.483
or I will kill you.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.468
TREY: As much as I would like to put my faith in Darius Tanz,

15:04.512 --> 15:06.427
we need to accept that
this asteroid is coming

15:06.470 --> 15:08.037
and we might not be able
to stop it.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.735
The government's plan
is one of last resort,

15:10.779 --> 15:13.260
the doomsday protocol.
I've reached out to the UN.

15:13.303 --> 15:16.567
We've formed an international
coalition with the Russian

15:16.611 --> 15:18.656
and Chinese governments;
we're all on the same side now.

15:18.700 --> 15:22.225
Our plan is to launch
nuclear weapons in outer space

15:22.269 --> 15:24.706
before the asteroid
breaches the atmosphere.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.361
Mr. President, forgive me,
but we've been down this road.

15:27.404 --> 15:30.059
I mean, this will break
the asteroid into pieces

15:30.103 --> 15:32.496
which will rain down on Earth
in unpredictable ways.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.281
Billions of people could die.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.587
TREY: I'm aware of the
consequences, Mr. Secretary,

15:36.631 --> 15:38.241
but our scientists
believe Tanz's plan

15:38.285 --> 15:40.548
has a 20% chance of success.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.767
Those odds make
no one comfortable.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.508
Given this reality,

15:44.552 --> 15:47.511
Director Davis is here to go
over our doomsday protocol.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.078
I turn the floor over to her.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.775
Thank you, Mr. President.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.212
Assuming the worst,

15:52.255 --> 15:54.040
preparations are being made
for food and shelter.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.607
Now, we have ordered the
construction of grow houses,

15:56.651 --> 15:58.870
but it will take time
to get them up and running.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.482
In the meantime, we
are making stockpiles.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.092
And shelters?

16:03.136 --> 16:05.616
All public bunkers are full.The FBI,

16:05.660 --> 16:07.053
along with DTRA,

16:07.096 --> 16:08.619
Homeland Security,
Housing and Agriculture

16:08.663 --> 16:11.318
have taken steps
to preserve life and order

16:11.361 --> 16:12.493
for all those that remain.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.582
What about government officials?

16:14.625 --> 16:15.757
What's the protocol?

16:15.800 --> 16:18.238
DAVIS: The president,
vice president,

16:18.281 --> 16:20.153
along with members
of the cabinet, the congress

16:20.196 --> 16:22.851
and agency directors will all
move into survival shelters.

16:22.894 --> 16:26.202
Now, each will be limited to
bringing only his or her spouse

16:26.246 --> 16:27.899
and direct dependents.

16:27.943 --> 16:31.468
Wait, spouses and family members
are now included?

16:31.512 --> 16:32.817
Revised protocol
under President Mackenzie.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.254
She added those provisions.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.038
TREY: Now, resources
will be directed

16:36.082 --> 16:38.693
to the construction of shelters
and food production.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.828
NORA : What would
you have wanted me to do?

16:43.872 --> 16:45.178
I-I couldn't just
let them come in.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.049
BASS:
Do not question me.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.703
NORA:
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.009
BASS:
We wouldn't be in this position

16:50.052 --> 16:51.271
if it weren't
for your foolishness.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.229
Taking up arms?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.014
Shooting
a police officer?

16:55.057 --> 16:57.886
I was trying to
protect our people.

16:57.929 --> 17:01.107
We cannot have
another disaster.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.501
We need to be careful if we're
going to complete our mission.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.739
So, at, say,
30 kilometers per second,

17:24.782 --> 17:28.090
a slug will travel at 2.6
million kilometers per day.

17:28.134 --> 17:31.963
Given the trajectory and the
velocity, it'll take the Ark...

17:32.007 --> 17:36.751
27 days to reach
the asteroid. Liam?

17:36.794 --> 17:38.927
What are you doing?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.844
I'm sorry. Nothing.

17:42.887 --> 17:43.845
Yeah, I can see that.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.412
But why?

17:45.455 --> 17:47.979
I just can't believe

17:48.023 --> 17:50.852
we're in this place
because of...

17:50.895 --> 17:53.985
Because of your
ex

17:54.029 --> 17:57.685
Jillian blew up
the whole damn world

17:57.728 --> 17:59.556
and you're still
pining for her.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.993
I'm the reason she got into
this mess in the first place.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.692
She left Boston,
left her family because of me,

18:04.735 --> 18:06.433
and then I abandoned her.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.870
You can't possibly blame
yourself for her crazy.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.307
She was isolated.
COPE took advantage of that.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.570
And I knew something was off and
I should have gotten her out.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.877
How, by kidnapping her?If I had to, yes.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.313
I don't even know
if she's alive.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.141
Because of her,
there's a good chance

18:19.185 --> 18:21.709
that 53 days from now,
none of us will be alive.

18:21.752 --> 18:22.927
She never would've
done this knowingly.

18:22.971 --> 18:23.928
I don't believe it.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.278
Jillian is a lost cause.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.062
How can we still be
talking about her?

18:27.106 --> 18:29.369
Because when you love someone,
you don't just give up on them.

18:32.415 --> 18:35.114
Well, maybe you should!

18:38.769 --> 18:41.946
I promised myself I'd never
come to you like this.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.081
It's for Zoe.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.257
My money's worthless.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.955
To buy a spot in a bunker
on the black market,

18:50.999 --> 18:52.870
they're asking
for hard assets.

18:52.914 --> 18:57.527
Grace... I funded half the
Ark out of my own pocket.

18:57.571 --> 19:01.705
My money's on paper-- real
estate, stocks, investments.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.968
And you know what's
happened to all that.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.406
I wish I could offer
you something.

19:06.449 --> 19:11.280
More than anything, I wish
I could help, but...

19:11.324 --> 19:14.370
in some ways, I'm in the
same position as you now.

19:14.414 --> 19:17.068
You have your hangar,
sealed off underground.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.983
Once we launch
Salvation,that hangar

19:19.027 --> 19:20.637
will be rendered
uninhabitable.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.292
This plan will work.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.425
How do you know that?
Every plan has failed up to now.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.037
I'm sorry.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.910
You've lost faith.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.434
Darius, I always believe in you,

19:34.477 --> 19:36.392
for better or for worse.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.220
It's just...

19:38.264 --> 19:39.830
faith is a luxury right now.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.355
It's not a solution.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.838
Let me see
what-what I can do.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.322
What's happening?

19:53.366 --> 19:55.194
The telemetry.
Something's wrong.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.760
Wait here a moment.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.458
ALYCIA:
.23, track .23.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.894
DARIUS:
What's going on?

19:59.937 --> 20:02.853
The rail gun slugs you fired
before it was sabotaged,

20:02.897 --> 20:04.377
they're not gonna hit
the asteroid.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.292
What? That can't be right.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.511
Yeah, well, the tracking data
doesn't lie.

20:08.555 --> 20:09.904
Why didn't we notice
this earlier?

20:09.947 --> 20:12.907
Well, the variance has
been subtle over days,

20:12.950 --> 20:15.344
never enough to trip
the alarm until now.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.912
I have quadruple-checked
the targeting package.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.914
I ran the computer
simulations.

20:19.957 --> 20:24.005
The math is correct.
Rosetta and her team

20:24.048 --> 20:26.747
accounted for magnetic fields,
solar flares, radiation.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.228
I personally checked it all.This is a disaster.

20:29.271 --> 20:32.187
The calculations used to program
the rail gun are the same ones

20:32.231 --> 20:33.928
we'll need to pilot the Ark
and if they're off,

20:33.971 --> 20:36.322
then plan C...Is no plan at all.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.857
GRACE:
I-I don't know what to think.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.948
Darius looked uncertain
for the first time maybe ever.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.906
It scared me.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.865
He's gonna try to help us
with a survival bunker, but...

20:57.908 --> 20:58.953
Don't bother.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.259
I have a place for us.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.130
You do

21:02.173 --> 21:03.262
Yeah.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.786
My God.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.440
Oh, that's great news.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.576
Isn't it?

21:13.620 --> 21:17.232
Depends...

21:17.276 --> 21:21.715
on how you feel
about what I say next.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.283
Those federal bunkers,
there's a spot for me.

21:25.849 --> 21:29.375
But I can also bring
my spouse and her children.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.643
Harris, I can't ask you...

21:36.686 --> 21:39.385
You're not asking.
I'm-I'm offering.

21:39.428 --> 21:42.431
Grace, in the Ark,
when we had hypoxia,

21:42.475 --> 21:45.042
what was the last image you saw
before losing consciousness?

21:51.353 --> 21:54.182
I don't remember.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.184
Well, I do.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.055
It was you.

21:58.099 --> 22:01.624
I know, yes, this is
a marriage of necessity,

22:01.668 --> 22:06.368
but the truth is...
I never stopped loving you.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.374
I bought this for you
six months ago.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.334
Harris...
Before our plans
were interrupted.

22:22.036 --> 22:24.386
Grace, will
you marry me?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.173
LIAM: All right,
give me the asteroid albedo

22:29.217 --> 22:30.479
and rotation rate again.

22:30.523 --> 22:34.309
0.046 and 5.9 times ten
to the minus six hertz.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.919
That's what I have, too.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.921
That's because our
numbers are right.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.401
Well, clearly,
something went wrong.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.664
ALYCIA: Maybe there's
a glitch in Tess.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.884
I mean, since you shut her down
and then restarted her,

22:43.927 --> 22:45.146
she's never been the same.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.365
So it's my fault?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.453
Well, it's not mine.

22:47.496 --> 22:48.715
Darius, we need
to get Tess started

22:48.758 --> 22:50.499
on those orbital
calculations right away.

22:50.543 --> 22:51.805
We need to launch that Ark

22:51.848 --> 22:54.024
as soon as those EmDrives
are attached.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.548
You sure Uncle Nick's
gonna deliver?

22:55.591 --> 22:58.377
It's already on route,
a direct trade, Nick for rock.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.944
The FBI will oversee it,
but I need you to be there.Yeah.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.424
ALYCIA: But what good
is all of this

23:02.468 --> 23:03.686
if the calculations
are off?

23:03.730 --> 23:05.949
We still don't know
where to aim the Ark.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.429
LIAM:
Stop being so negative.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
No, she's right.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.913
We'll need a fail-safe
to be able to adjust,

23:12.956 --> 23:14.480
otherwise this plan won't work.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.351
We'll need our targeting systems

23:16.395 --> 23:18.484
to be adaptable
at a moment's notice.

23:18.527 --> 23:19.876
How do we do that?

23:19.920 --> 23:24.751
We remove the element of...
distance.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.104
Keep looking
for the miscalculation

23:30.147 --> 23:31.235
that you won't find.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.586
Where are you going?

23:33.629 --> 23:38.678
To take care of some
unfinished business.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.815
ZOE: So you're gonna
marry Harris?

23:45.859 --> 23:49.253
Yes. And we'll all be together,
you, me, Harris and the baby.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.733
Yeah, and what?

23:50.777 --> 23:52.518
Live under the ground
like a bunch of mole people?

23:52.561 --> 23:55.434
Only if everything
else fails.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.087
This would just
be temporary.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.524
Well, how long are we
gonna be down there?

23:58.567 --> 23:59.916
I don't know yet,

23:59.960 --> 24:01.483
but you're my daughter,
and you're pregnant

24:01.527 --> 24:03.180
and it's my duty
to keep you safe.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.530
Well, what if I wasn't pregnant?

24:04.573 --> 24:07.533
Would you still be
marrying Harris?

24:13.756 --> 24:16.280
I went to the
doctor today,

24:16.324 --> 24:18.239
just to talk
about my options.

24:20.807 --> 24:23.549
Can I really bring a
baby into all this?

24:23.592 --> 24:25.464
Should I?

24:27.814 --> 24:29.424
No one can answer
that question but you.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.426
Yeah.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.863
I thought about it.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.822
I want this baby.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.304
And I feel like if
I give up on this,

24:40.348 --> 24:44.265
I'm giving up
on the world.

24:44.308 --> 24:48.008
Like I've lost hope.

24:48.051 --> 24:51.664
Is there still hope, Mom?

24:59.628 --> 25:03.589
There's always hope.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.591
Okay.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.136
♪

25:32.487 --> 25:33.793
Are you okay?

25:33.836 --> 25:35.142
Fine.

25:35.185 --> 25:38.232
What are you doing up?

25:38.275 --> 25:41.148
I couldn't sleep.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.327
It wasn't fair...

25:46.370 --> 25:48.938
the way that Bass
spoke to you.

25:48.982 --> 25:52.725
And no one has
been more loyal.

25:58.295 --> 26:00.123
He didn't mean it.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.604
He's under a lot
of stress right now.

26:02.648 --> 26:05.085
Don't make
excuses for him.

26:08.741 --> 26:12.571
I'm not strong
like you are, Jillian.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.707
It's gonna be okay, Nora.

26:20.709 --> 26:24.147
We just need to stick together.

26:43.950 --> 26:46.605
NICHOLAS:
Liam.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.737
Good to see you again, son.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.609
I wish I could say the same.

27:01.402 --> 27:02.795
Satisfied?

27:06.233 --> 27:07.974
Let him go.

27:18.419 --> 27:21.248
I'll see you soon.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.733
Darius?

28:11.777 --> 28:14.170
Uh, it's...Midnight.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.956
I, um, I brought an
age-appropriate date,

28:16.999 --> 28:18.784
for what it's worth.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.750
Is Zoe here?

28:28.794 --> 28:32.623
She went to her dad's.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.714
There's something
I want to...
We've had a...

28:35.757 --> 28:37.672
You first.
You go.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.028
Let's leave this to chance.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.345
No chivalry in fate,
I guess.

28:58.388 --> 29:02.218
Okay, so,
we've had a setback,

29:02.262 --> 29:04.394
as you know.
Yes.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.527
I think I know how
to fix the problem.

29:06.570 --> 29:09.095
You do?

29:09.138 --> 29:12.228
In order to make sure we hit the
asteroid in just the right spot,

29:12.272 --> 29:14.056
we'll need someone
aboard Salvation

29:14.100 --> 29:17.451
with the technical knowledge
to make last-second adjustments.

29:17.494 --> 29:22.586
And, um...
it's a one-way ticket.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.763
So, what are you saying?

29:24.806 --> 29:27.548
You... you're going
up in the Ark?

29:28.941 --> 29:30.507
It's a suicide mission.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.683
I have no choice, Grace.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.729
It has to be me.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.176
What is wrong with you?

29:47.220 --> 29:49.091
You-you come here in
the middle of the night

29:49.135 --> 29:50.701
with a bottle of
wine to tell me

29:50.745 --> 29:52.529
you're going on a
suicide mission? I mean,

29:52.573 --> 29:54.096
what the hell am I supposed
to do with that information?

29:54.140 --> 29:56.098
Celebrate

29:56.142 --> 29:58.405
Here's to Darius
going up in flames.

29:58.448 --> 30:01.321
I thought you might want
to hear it from me in person.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.889
Well, I don't. I don't want
to hear it from you at all.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.847
No one knows the Ark
like I do, Grace.

30:07.762 --> 30:12.680
I can't let the human race go to
hell while I cower in a bunker.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.856
I'm-I'm on borrowed time,
anyway.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.205
Don't.If you do the math,

30:16.249 --> 30:18.947
trading one life for 7 billion
is a good deal.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.993
But why does it have to be you?

30:21.036 --> 30:24.823
God, I hate this.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.389
All of it.

30:26.433 --> 30:27.913
That stupid-ass space rock
has ruined everything,

30:27.956 --> 30:29.436
the whole damn thing.

30:36.008 --> 30:39.925
The silver lining...

30:39.968 --> 30:43.232
We would never have
met without it.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.805
Grace.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.243
I'm here because...

30:54.287 --> 30:58.247
whatever time I have left...

30:58.291 --> 30:59.858
I want to spend with you.

31:02.991 --> 31:05.037
Unless...

31:28.147 --> 31:30.540
♪

31:48.558 --> 31:50.560
♪

32:04.357 --> 32:06.402
Let's get back
to the truck.

32:06.446 --> 32:09.014
We need to load the supplies
and get them to our team.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.346
MAN:
Let's head outside.

32:37.390 --> 32:38.478
:
Come on...

32:49.576 --> 32:51.926
MAN: Get these weapons
to the other facility.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.581
You got it.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.759
MAN 2: Hey, uh, what
do you think's going on?

32:58.802 --> 33:00.848
MAN: I don't ask
any questions.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.545
Just need to get this stuff
to the other facility.

33:02.589 --> 33:05.244
That's all I know.MAN 2: All right.

33:05.287 --> 33:08.464
We'll get it loaded up.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.556
MAN 2:
That's about it.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.818
I'll grab the rest...

33:36.492 --> 33:38.494
What do you want, Uncle?

33:38.538 --> 33:41.628
Oh, I want to help you and your
little red-headed girlfriend.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.412
Somehow, I doubt that.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.240
Well, a little bird told me

33:45.284 --> 33:48.504
that she and the defense
secretary Harris Edwards

33:48.548 --> 33:51.594
were looking into
a long-term survival bunker.

33:51.638 --> 33:54.815
:
I told you,

33:54.858 --> 33:57.078
you leave her alone.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.298
Well, I'm looking
after your interests

33:59.341 --> 34:01.300
as well as mine, Darius.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.605
I have...

34:02.649 --> 34:04.868
a bunker for her
and her daughter.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.566
What do you get out of all this?

34:06.609 --> 34:08.959
You unfreeze my assets.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.486
You told me I was
a hopeless dreamer.

34:13.529 --> 34:17.446
That I would fail
and leave this planet doomed.

34:17.490 --> 34:20.536
A good gambler always
hedges his bets.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.713
One way or another,
I intend to survive this.

34:23.757 --> 34:26.499
Uh, I'm like a cockroach,
in that sense.

34:26.542 --> 34:30.285
But I'd rather be
a rich cockroach.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.505
Deal or no deal?

34:37.553 --> 34:39.729
Meet me at the parking garage
on Aberdeen.

34:39.773 --> 34:43.559
With the papers for that bunker.

34:43.603 --> 34:44.995
Very well.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.564
He's on his way.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.528
Darius?

34:57.878 --> 34:59.836
Where are you going?

35:03.579 --> 35:06.408
Out for a bit.

35:06.452 --> 35:10.195
I'll be back in time
to make you breakfast.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.501
Promise?

35:12.545 --> 35:14.547
I do.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.181
What are you doing?

35:40.225 --> 35:42.183
I'm comparing Samson's path

35:42.227 --> 35:43.663
with all previously
recorded asteroids.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.230
I'm looking for other

35:45.273 --> 35:47.188
orbital trajectory variations.Liam.

35:47.232 --> 35:50.235
And if I can find the variable
to cause the slug to miss.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.758
Liam.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.631
Do you realize
what Darius is planning?

35:55.675 --> 35:57.677
He's gonna pilot
Salvationhimself.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.244
That's his choice, Liam.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.941
You know you won't be able
to talk him out of it.

36:00.984 --> 36:03.509
Well, if I can figure this
out, then he won't have to.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.641
Okay. Enough. It's 5:00 a.m.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.166
I'm down there
trying to make an EmDrive

36:08.209 --> 36:09.645
that'll save the planet.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.169
You want to do
something for Darius?

36:11.212 --> 36:13.475
Make sure that he doesn't
die for no reason.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.824
Now, I need you down there
to help me program

36:14.868 --> 36:16.217
the launch simulator
for the Salvation

36:16.261 --> 36:18.219
with the full payload.

36:18.263 --> 36:21.222
Ugh, how can you just be
business as usual?

36:21.266 --> 36:23.398
I care about this man,
and he is willing

36:23.442 --> 36:24.704
to sacrifice himself
for all of us.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.488
I mean, do you even
have a heart?

36:26.532 --> 36:27.576
Do I...?

36:27.620 --> 36:31.580
Do I have a heart?

36:31.624 --> 36:33.495
Are you kidding me?

36:35.018 --> 36:36.455
You broke it.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.676
Geez.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.678
Alycia, I'm...

36:42.722 --> 36:46.116
I'm sorry.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.683
You always seem so...

36:47.727 --> 36:50.033
Cold?

36:50.077 --> 36:51.905
Strong.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.517
I thought I was just a...

36:55.561 --> 36:57.737
Well, you weren't.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.999
Hey, um...Please.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.654
Don't. It's humiliating enough

37:01.697 --> 37:03.221
that you're still
in love with her.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.355
You know, Liam,

37:07.399 --> 37:09.749
I don't want
to lose Darius, either.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.011
Believe it or not.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.753
I do believe it.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.676
Alycia, hold the elevator.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.743
Allow us to sweep
the area, sir.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.484
Of course.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.451
Something's wrong.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.279
What the hell is that?

38:01.322 --> 38:03.716
It's a sonic weapon.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.370
Cover your ears!

38:59.119 --> 39:00.642
I think it's time
I make you breakfast.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.688
Hi.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.690
Interrupting something?Uh...

39:04.733 --> 39:07.388
Uh, no, no.
Come on in.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.397
What, uh, what's going on?

39:16.441 --> 39:18.747
I talked to the Secretary
of Affairs at the GAO.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.358
He asked that we get
paperwork filled out

39:20.401 --> 39:22.185
as soon as possible.

39:22.229 --> 39:25.580
So I called a buddy
of mine who's a judge;

39:25.624 --> 39:27.626
he can marry us today.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.457
A last minute
bouquet for a...

39:32.500 --> 39:34.459
last minute wedding.

39:34.502 --> 39:36.025
Today?

39:36.069 --> 39:37.592
Is that a problem?

39:46.035 --> 39:48.211
Where are you taking me?

39:48.255 --> 39:50.649
You really should have
given me half the Ark

39:50.692 --> 39:53.434
:
when I asked nicely.

40:02.356 --> 40:05.098
Hummingbird.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.280
Ease up on the next dose.

40:13.323 --> 40:15.238
We need him lucid.

40:17.545 --> 40:20.330
Come on. Oh, come on.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.725
Okay.

40:38.218 --> 40:39.611
Hello?

40:39.654 --> 40:41.134
JILLIAN:
Liam! Liam, Liam, it's me.

40:41.177 --> 40:42.440
Jillian.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.528
Hey, where are you?

40:43.571 --> 40:44.964
Oh, I don't, I don't know.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.879
Um, COPE, they,

40:46.922 --> 40:48.924
they took us somewhere and...

40:48.968 --> 40:51.144
I-I escaped and-and now I'm, uh,

40:51.187 --> 40:53.494
I'm near a road.

40:53.538 --> 40:56.497
I swear, I... I had no idea
what they were planning

40:56.541 --> 40:57.759
with the rail gun.Are you okay?

40:57.803 --> 40:59.892
Oh, uh, I don't have
a lot of time.

40:59.935 --> 41:02.503
Bass is planning something
and I-I don't know what it is,

41:02.547 --> 41:04.505
but I-I heard him talking and...

41:08.466 --> 41:10.772
Hold on.What's going on?

41:20.608 --> 41:21.435
Darius.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.176
What about Darius?

41:23.219 --> 41:25.178
They have Dar...

41:25.221 --> 41:27.441
Jillian. Jillian.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.456
Liam.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.544
What was that?

41:43.588 --> 41:45.720
Where's Darius?

41:47.069 --> 41:50.116
BASS:
You didn't damage him, did you?

41:50.159 --> 41:53.554
Scuffed but not marred.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.643
As long as his mind is intact.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.568
I thought nothing about you
could shock me,

42:07.612 --> 42:10.528
but the two of you
being in bed together...

42:10.571 --> 42:12.138
Let me guess,

42:12.181 --> 42:16.708
you met at a cocktail party
in hell.

42:20.363 --> 42:22.670
Sebastian's father was one

42:22.714 --> 42:25.804
of the founding members
of the Q-17,

42:25.847 --> 42:29.547
and a dear friend who shares
a common interest.

42:29.590 --> 42:32.027
And now we shall have it.
Both of us.

42:34.639 --> 42:37.903
You crazy son of a bitch.

42:37.946 --> 42:39.557
What are you doing?!

42:39.600 --> 42:41.602
I'm taking what's mine.

42:41.646 --> 42:43.430
DARIUS:
This is insane!

42:43.473 --> 42:46.128
It's best that you accept
the truth, Mr. Tanz.

42:46.172 --> 42:48.566
This asteroid is
our destiny.

42:48.609 --> 42:49.915
You really are mad.

42:49.958 --> 42:53.614
This world will be destroyed,

42:53.658 --> 42:55.616
but I intend to build
a better one

42:55.660 --> 42:57.575
with only the best people.

42:59.228 --> 43:01.535
I am Noah.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.189
And I believe you have my Ark.
