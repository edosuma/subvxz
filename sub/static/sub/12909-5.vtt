00:19.000 --> 00:21.030
'Accident on a building site.'

00:21.080 --> 00:22.350
It's The Scimitar.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.230
A few days before he died,
he went to see someone --

00:25.280 --> 00:26.510
an antiques dealer.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.500
'I think he sold something to Gulliver.'

00:51.880 --> 00:54.190
- Charles Matherson.
- The minister?

00:54.240 --> 00:57.190
He's corrupt and I want you to nail him.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.910
- We'll need to look into his private life.
- I'll find a way in.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.590
There can't be any
question of a delay, Louis.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.310
The order's already been confirmed.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.670
- Got to keep a clear head.
- Why? - Cos I'm working.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.310
- You don't want to offend these guys.
- All right.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.990
No, no, no... Can't fall asleep.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.750
Wait, you're making a mistake.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.510
- There are two of them.
- What?

01:29.560 --> 01:31.150
I can find it for you!

01:31.200 --> 01:33.200
I can do that myself.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.670
Jesus!

01:35.720 --> 01:37.830
How did this happen? How COULD it happen?

01:37.880 --> 01:40.950
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know it's not my fault.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.740
It's your fault!

03:04.880 --> 03:08.150
I thought they already did throw you out.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.550
Yeah... then they took me back.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.800
And now they're going
to throw you out again?

03:16.080 --> 03:19.920
- You do like to make things difficult
for yourself. - It's not me.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.110
It wasn't my fault. My DS hates me.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.430
What about Stefan? Isn't he on your side?

03:26.480 --> 03:29.480
Stephan's SFO. He's nothing to do with me.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.160
He's your friend.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.150
Please tell me you don't fancy him.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.230
Why would you say that?

03:48.480 --> 03:51.560
I don't know. He's an idiot.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.350
We had a fight.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.600
Men!

03:59.160 --> 04:02.550
Just go back in there and
tell them what happened.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.190
I fell asleep?

04:04.240 --> 04:05.680
No.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.240
- Narcolepsy? - Yeah, it's,
erm... a neurological condition.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.960
You know, in-in the brain.

04:25.600 --> 04:31.350
Don't try and bullshit me,
Sayyad. You fell asleep.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.430
(Yes, guv.)

04:33.480 --> 04:35.030
Tell me, Derek.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.710
According to forensics, somebody
tried Gulliver to a chair

04:37.760 --> 04:42.150
- and then set him on fire.
- Jesus Christ.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.830
- Was there any sign of forced entry?
- It didn't look like it.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.790
Then he must have known
them. He let them in.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.110
At one o'clock in the morning?

04:48.160 --> 04:51.110
All right, well, the cameras, I'm
assuming they were still working?!

04:51.160 --> 04:52.750
I don't know, guv.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.430
Detective Superintendent
Milton's on top of all that,

04:55.480 --> 04:58.470
but, as you can imagine, he's
not been too cooperative.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.670
DI Heywood, thank you so
much for lending me your man.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.510
Your man who buggered up this
operation in the first place,

05:05.560 --> 05:07.430
put my DC out of action...

05:07.480 --> 05:09.950
then didn't notice when my
target was being murdered!

05:10.000 --> 05:13.200
All right, shall we
take this into my office?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.910
We found nothing that
implicates Charles Matherson

05:20.960 --> 05:23.710
in anything illegal or
even faintly suspicious.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.430
No second properties,
no company associations,

05:27.480 --> 05:29.550
nothing unusual in his bank...

05:29.600 --> 05:32.750
- There is just the question of his wife.
- What about her?

05:32.800 --> 05:38.190
- Helen Matherson. Her father owns a
quarry in Yorkshire. - We know that.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.830
Well, the father is
unwell. He has dementia.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.110
Helen Matherson has taken
full control of the business.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.830
Well, that proves our point.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.350
No, no, not necessarily.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.990
It's not a crime for a minister's
wife to run her own business.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.350
Did you get anything from his computer?

05:53.400 --> 05:55.950
- Nothing that isn't already on
public record. - Wait a minute.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.870
Helen Matherson is selling
ragstone to the Wesley Brothers

05:58.920 --> 06:01.230
for millions of pounds and her husband,

06:01.280 --> 06:04.670
Charles Matherson, just happened
to green light their latest project?

06:04.720 --> 06:07.310
Are they paying market prices or
are they paying over the odds?

06:07.360 --> 06:08.910
No, I checked the invoices.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.590
There were four major
sales over the last year,

06:11.640 --> 06:13.550
all at reasonable market rates.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.550
You see? They're doing nothing wrong.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.910
I'm sorry, I can see no reason

06:18.960 --> 06:21.390
to further authorise this investigation.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.230
So we've been wasting our time?

06:23.280 --> 06:26.870
No, Stefan, we've just been doing our job.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.590
What on earth happened to your eye?

06:30.760 --> 06:36.270
Pfft, nothing. I had an argument.
Someone I know. He's an idiot.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.390
What, you really think you can
walk in here looking like that?

06:39.440 --> 06:42.630
- This has nothing to do with work.
- Well, I'm happy to hear it.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.070
I cannot have people working
here looking as though

06:45.120 --> 06:48.910
they've been in a barroom brawl.
You should never have come in.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.630
I came in because I wanted to help.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.470
You can help me by staying at
home until you look presentable.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.710
And may I remind you this is
not fun? This is not a lark.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.700
This is serious business. No, no, no, no.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.220
Heh. Right.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.870
Remind me again what
we know about Gulliver.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.430
Well, I've told you, he's a handler.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.870
He's dealt in stolen
objects, art, antiques.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.670
He's very smart. Never did any time,

07:16.720 --> 07:19.550
but we think he's connected
to any number of London gangs,

07:19.600 --> 07:23.040
including the one that's been
making public sculptures.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.670
If Gulliver's got a whole
load of disreputable friends,

07:27.720 --> 07:30.230
surely any one of them could
have been responsible?

07:30.280 --> 07:31.710
Well, one thing's for certain --

07:31.760 --> 07:33.710
we're not going to find much at his place.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.560
It's pretty much burnt to the ground.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.670
All right, well...

07:39.720 --> 07:43.630
- let us take over from here.
- And what am I meant to do in the meantime?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.710
Well, didn't you get
anything from the van?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.390
No. We spoke to the owner of
the company that rented it,

07:48.440 --> 07:51.710
a lowlife called Jerry Clarke,
but he's not helping us at all.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.670
Half his vehicles aren't even insured.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.390
We should close the whole lot down.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.790
Jerry Clarke?

07:59.840 --> 08:03.280
- I'm sorry?
- Erm... Have you met him?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.790
What does it matter to you?

08:06.840 --> 08:08.510
Everything all right, John?

08:08.560 --> 08:13.830
I don't know, JC. You were
just leaving, weren't you?

08:13.880 --> 08:18.070
Thickset, dark hair, clean-shaven?

08:18.120 --> 08:21.110
I haven't met him. Spoke
to him on the phone.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.470
Well, I think I saw him.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.830
When I was at Gulliver's place,

08:24.880 --> 08:26.870
he was talking to someone
and he called him JC.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.630
It could have been anyone.

08:28.680 --> 08:32.400
But suppose whoever stole the
sculptures didn't RENT the van...

08:33.960 --> 08:36.159
.. suppose they owned it.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.600
Police! Police! You're under arrest!

09:06.880 --> 09:09.230
What's all this about? What
do you think you're doing?!

09:09.280 --> 09:11.110
- Jerry Clarke?
- Yeah.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.110
- Is this the man you saw?
- Yeah.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.100
You're under arrest.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.060
Watch your head.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.320
Guv! Through here!

09:46.560 --> 09:48.710
Let me just check my diary.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.830
Yeah, yeah, I think it'll be fine.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.480
OK, I'll speak to you later. Bye.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.400
Miss Andrews?

10:00.320 --> 10:02.630
I'm a mate of Adam Jannsen.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.750
- He shared with you,
is that right? - Yeah.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.390
Well, he had something of mine.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.270
A little gold dish, about this big.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.920
Not valuable, just... sentimental.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.670
But I want it back.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.070
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.910
You find it,

10:20.960 --> 10:24.030
you return it to me.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.670
How can I do that when I
don't even know who you are?

10:27.720 --> 10:31.150
Well, I'll come back
here in a couple of days.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.340
Make sure you've got it.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.720
Or else.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.560
Or else what?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.720
Sir? Sir?!

11:09.560 --> 11:12.830
Yeah, he's with us now.
It's fine, thank you.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.710
Can you explain this?!

11:14.760 --> 11:18.110
It's fairly straightforward
-- it's a viability appraisal.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.790
- And you're going to present it
to the council. - We already have.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.030
A 60% cut in affordable housing,
no health centre, no local park,

11:24.080 --> 11:25.670
no transport improvements.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.710
You have gone back on every single
one of your Section 106 obligations!

11:28.760 --> 11:31.590
Section 106 obligations are
there to be renegotiated,

11:31.640 --> 11:32.710
everybody knows that.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.030
You were always going to do
this, right from the start.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.030
You have taken advantage
of the planning laws!

11:37.080 --> 11:39.550
Which your government brought
in, let's not forget that.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.350
It's all about sustainable development.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.910
It's about sustaining the
community, not your profits!

11:43.960 --> 11:45.030
I gave you the green light

11:45.080 --> 11:47.910
because I thought you were going
to benefit a whole area of London.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.030
Starting, of course, with
you and Mrs Matherson.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.390
You've benefited quite a
bit yourselves, as I recall.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.910
If you go ahead with these demands,

11:53.960 --> 11:55.750
you are going to make me a laughing stock.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.710
Is that was this is all about?

11:57.760 --> 12:01.070
Get real, Charles. We're
on a knife-edge here.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.750
We need to persuade the
investors to hang in with us

12:03.800 --> 12:05.830
and, if they pull out, we're all screwed

12:05.880 --> 12:07.590
and I don't just mean Elly and me.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.830
We're all in this together.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.510
I've done nothing illegal.
Nobody's going to come after me.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.870
But if you try and wriggle
out of your commitments,

12:14.920 --> 12:17.260
I swear I will make you pay!

12:19.240 --> 12:21.040
You already have.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.990
I've been going through these invoices

12:54.040 --> 12:56.070
and there is something
that's been bugging me.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.510
This came off the memory
stick from the Mathersons.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.590
White Dragon Shipping.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.070
What about it?

13:02.120 --> 13:04.630
Helen Matherson has paid
White Dragon Shipping

13:04.680 --> 13:07.390
on four separate occasions.
They're listed here.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.710
Paid them? What for?

13:08.760 --> 13:12.480
Presumably for exporting ragstone.
These are huge containers.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.430
That must be the samples I saw.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.310
There was a whole box of
them labelled in Mandarin.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.230
Look at the dates.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.550
Now, compare them to these.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.750
These are the four sales
I mentioned before,

13:28.800 --> 13:30.870
each between £1m and £2m.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.590
They're all about a month later.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.030
So Helen Matherson is
selling to the Chinese

13:35.080 --> 13:36.870
and then she sells to the Wesleys.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.590
Is it a coincidence?
How does it make sense?

13:39.640 --> 13:42.710
They've just negotiated a new sale,

13:42.760 --> 13:45.100
this time it's The Scimitar.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.230
According to your logic,

13:47.280 --> 13:50.950
the Mathersons are making
another deal with White Dragon.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.740
I hope it helps.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.670
We need to find out if there's
another ship coming in.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.350
It might be here already.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.270
Marcus, Eleanor closed
down the investigation.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.110
She sent me home.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.960
Then she won't know what you're up to.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.910
You wanted to see me?

14:16.960 --> 14:18.670
Yes, Alison, come in.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.120
Sit down.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.510
That was good work this morning,

14:24.560 --> 14:27.070
Helen Matherson running
her father's quarry,

14:27.120 --> 14:28.670
that makes a big difference.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.660
Thank you, Eleanor.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.320
What I'm interested in is how
you came about that information.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.510
Peter Mayhew gave it to me.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.000
He's your uncle, isn't he?

14:44.480 --> 14:47.750
- You knew. - Well, I make it my
business to know as much as I can

14:47.800 --> 14:50.070
about the people I employ.

14:50.880 --> 14:54.800
- What have you told him about us?
- I try to tell him as little as I can.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.160
I'm sorry, Eleanor.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.830
No, don't be.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.150
I dropped the investigation

15:04.200 --> 15:06.790
because I don't want Peter
Mayhew manipulating us

15:06.840 --> 15:09.510
like he's been manipulating you.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.430
But that said...

15:11.480 --> 15:13.670
it might be useful to keep his connection.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.790
If we continue this investigation,

15:15.840 --> 15:18.870
it'll be on our terms, not Mayhew's,

15:18.920 --> 15:22.910
but it's fine if he knows that we're
not pursuing Charles Matherson.

15:22.960 --> 15:27.440
And, of course, I'd prefer it if you
didn't mention to him that I knew.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.670
I won't say anything.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.750
Thank you.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.470
I knew I could rely on you, Alison.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.620
You realise I should get
rid of you, don't you?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.950
There's no reason why you
should stay one minute longer

16:11.000 --> 16:13.480
as a TDC in my office.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.630
I made a mistake and
it won't happen again.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.110
It certainly won't happen
again if you're out, will it?

16:20.160 --> 16:22.230
- Guv, I...
- Shut up!

16:23.200 --> 16:26.240
Let me see if I can talk
myself out of firing you.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.400
Now, firstly, and this is
not... entirely relevant...

16:33.520 --> 16:36.910
.. nobody is going to mourn
the loss of John Gulliver.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.190
Secondly, Detective
Superintendent Milton's

16:40.240 --> 16:43.950
got his precious statues
back, largely thanks to you.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.390
And I think you may have
been right about Adam Jannsen

16:47.440 --> 16:49.910
and I think that just about...

16:51.000 --> 16:53.200
.. gets you off the hook.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.760
Thank you.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.120
It doesn't mean I want
to see you around here.

17:04.040 --> 17:08.000
Blackstone's Handbook
For Policing Students.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.430
Evidence and Procedure.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.200
Investigator's Manual and Workbook.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.470
- I've read that one.
- Read it again!

17:32.320 --> 17:33.870
Well?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.310
Eleanor's dropped the investigation.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.440
That's a great pity.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.630
She doesn't think there's enough evidence

17:43.680 --> 17:45.830
against Charles Matherson or his wife.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.430
Then she can't have looked very far.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.030
I hate doing this,

17:50.080 --> 17:53.990
- I hate being disloyal.
- Family loyalty comes first, Alison,

17:54.040 --> 17:55.710
you know that.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.360
Anyway, I was helping you, I was
helping the SFO, or trying to.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.620
You never told me that you knew Eleanor.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.030
Hmm? Oh, yes, I knew her husband.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.550
I didn't know she was married.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.360
He died.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.630
It's a great shame.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.360
What?

18:20.840 --> 18:22.750
Matherson.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.590
Never mind.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.710
We'll find another way.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.500
That truck has to go down!
You've got to do this!

19:00.720 --> 19:02.910
They're all crooks, yeah?

19:02.960 --> 19:06.230
- I saw you arguing.
- They're not even paying me the living wage.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.670
- How do they get away with it?
- If I complain, they'll throw me out.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.060
- They're bastards.
- Yeah!

19:19.920 --> 19:22.260
You couldn't do me a favour?

20:10.200 --> 20:11.720
Miss Chen?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.600
- Yes?
- I'm from ELT.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.430
We're your IT support service. We've
had a call out about this computer.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.360
There's nothing wrong with my computer.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.750
There is a fault with the
dial-up connection --

20:27.800 --> 20:30.870
the PPP -- the point-to-point
negotiation point.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.660
It'll only take a couple of minutes.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.440
OK.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.500
You... you couldn't get
me a cup of coffee?

21:22.080 --> 21:23.480
Come on.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.520
Come on, come on!

21:40.720 --> 21:43.280
Come on, come on...

22:16.640 --> 22:18.550
Have a drink on me.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.940
Thanks.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.190
Charles, something rather
strange has just happened.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.310
I've just had a call from Mr Tang.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.160
- Who?
- White Dragon Shipping.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.190
- Is there a problem?
- There may be.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.750
Someone broke into their
office this afternoon,

22:46.800 --> 22:49.310
he said he was from a software company,

22:49.360 --> 22:52.030
and he accessed our account.

22:52.080 --> 22:56.790
- What? - He did a search, first
on your name and then on mine.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.350
- Who was it?
- They have no idea.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.400
They got a picture of him
as he was leaving on CCTV.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.190
That isn't a software engineer.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.780
This is the driver!

23:09.640 --> 23:12.110
All right, Charles. Thank you.

23:16.840 --> 23:21.190
You know, you really have made a
spectacular mess of all of this.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.360
Did what you said.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.990
You could have killed
Adam Jannsen at home.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.590
You could have killed
him on his way to work.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.150
Tried.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.080
Got close.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.980
- Hello, man.
- Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.870
There was someone with him...

23:43.920 --> 23:46.390
and you said it had to be done quickly.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.590
But not on the construction site.

23:48.640 --> 23:49.950
You never said that.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.790
You might have worked
out the consequences!

23:52.840 --> 23:55.110
Or don't you know anything?

23:56.080 --> 23:59.230
I know things you don't, Louis.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.510
I do things you won't.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.070
Maybe you should get
your hands dirty sometime

24:04.120 --> 24:06.790
before you lay into me. And
while we're on that subject,

24:06.840 --> 24:09.070
you still owe me ten grand for Gulliver.

24:09.120 --> 24:13.470
You'll have it. But first of all,
we need to close everything down.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.590
Do you understand me?

24:15.640 --> 24:19.710
No, I don't. What do you mean, exactly?

24:19.760 --> 24:23.350
I mean anything that leads anyone to me.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.500
This has gone on long
enough. Close it down.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.880
All right. Who do you
want me to deal with first?

24:41.640 --> 24:45.750
- So you've still got your job, then?
- Yeah, just about.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.600
- Do you want anything?
- No, I'm OK.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.230
Oh, might have found a room in a house.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.320
- That's great.
- It's in Dalston.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.150
There's a girl I met,
but it's complicated.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.070
- She's part of an investigation.
- What's she done?

25:02.120 --> 25:04.320
SHE hasn't done anything.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.400
I'll get it.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.880
Leila?

25:29.440 --> 25:30.710
Leila!

25:33.160 --> 25:35.830
- You! - Look, I've come to say sorry...

25:35.880 --> 25:37.680
about last night.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.200
Brought you some... wine.

25:45.040 --> 25:49.310
You brought me a bottle of wine to
apologise for getting me pissed?

25:49.360 --> 25:52.680
It was either that or flowers.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.190
- Do you want a beer?
- He's not staying!

25:56.240 --> 25:58.380
That'd be great, thanks.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.880
Cheers.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.070
How'd it go? With Heywood?

26:13.120 --> 26:16.510
Oh, yeah. No, he was fine about it.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.440
- Didn't mind at all.
- Really?

26:20.800 --> 26:22.070
No!

26:22.120 --> 26:25.150
- Of course not. What do you
think? He sent me home. - Me, too.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.270
- What happened?
- He... hit me.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.520
It wasn't like that.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.870
It's a long story.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.990
Our boss threw me out.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.710
She said I couldn't come
to work looking like this.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.310
Well, she has a point.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.110
- Want me to look at that?
- No! He's all right.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.350
Doesn't need any medical attention.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.800
I might.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.750
So what are you doing here, anyway?

26:51.800 --> 26:53.550
What do you want?

26:53.600 --> 26:57.100
- The people you met at
the Golabki Club. - Yeah?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.070
They were lying to you.

27:01.520 --> 27:05.320
Well, he didn't know Adam.
They just worked together.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.670
Roman Nowak?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.240
Yeah, and his girlfriend.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.220
How do you know?

27:22.680 --> 27:24.020
Stefan.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.030
Just stay there.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.020
I'll be right round.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.140
That was Karen.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.910
Been with the police all day.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.950
They made me wait for hours.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.200
I had to fill in forms, but
they're not going to do anything.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.000
Poor Sebastian.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.640
I'm sorry.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.150
- Are you OK? - I just hate
the idea of someone being here

27:58.200 --> 28:02.630
and going through my things.
This is about Adam, isn't it?

28:02.680 --> 28:05.670
Er... I think so, yeah.

28:05.720 --> 28:09.150
A man came up to me outside
the restaurant this morning.

28:09.200 --> 28:13.430
He said he was looking
for something -- a dish.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.910
- A satellite dish?
- No.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.160
A little gold dish.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.230
He said he was going to come back.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.230
- Did you tell the police this?
- Of course I did.

28:24.280 --> 28:28.190
I gave them his description, but
I'm not sure they're interested.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.070
It's not as if he hurt me.

28:31.120 --> 28:35.470
- Dish? - I just wish
I'd never got involved.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.110
I don't feel comfortable any more

28:38.160 --> 28:40.840
and I hate being here alone.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.350
I'll be glad when you move in.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.550
What?!

28:47.600 --> 28:50.070
Stefan's taking the spare room.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.670
When did you do that?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.550
What?

29:02.600 --> 29:04.470
The room? When did you even ask her?

29:04.520 --> 29:06.630
When I met her at the Golabki Club.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.470
She said she had a room going free.

29:08.520 --> 29:11.510
Yes, but only because her
flatmate had been murdered.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.110
I mean, I wonder why
she rang you and not me.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.190
Anyway, how could you do
that? You know, what was...?

29:17.240 --> 29:20.400
What was all that stuff about
us finding somewhere together?

29:21.600 --> 29:22.740
OK.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.750
Maybe I was out of line.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.750
What am I meant to do?

29:27.800 --> 29:30.430
- I need somewhere to live.
- Yes, so do I!

29:30.480 --> 29:33.350
- So, why didn't you ask her?
- I'm...

29:37.720 --> 29:38.990
I was going to.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.350
- It just didn't feel appropriate.
- Why not? - Why not? Um...

29:42.400 --> 29:44.430
I don't know. Maybe cos
I'm a police officer

29:44.480 --> 29:47.430
investigating the death of the
guy who used to live there(!)

29:47.480 --> 29:49.550
That's why you're pissed off?

29:49.600 --> 29:53.350
- Because I got there first?
- No! - Then what's the problem?

29:53.400 --> 29:55.390
Look, I don't even want to talk about it.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.870
All right? Now just get
lost. Forget we ever met.

29:57.920 --> 30:01.870
What about Roman and Eva?
Don't you want to know?

30:01.920 --> 30:03.590
What?

30:03.640 --> 30:05.720
They were lying to you.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.560
Yeah. How do you know?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.880
Why are you pretending
you don't speak English?

30:19.920 --> 30:22.190
Your Polish is obviously perfect...

30:22.240 --> 30:25.110
but I can hear an English accent, too.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.750
You've been here a long time.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.990
Look, we just want to
know who killed Adam.

30:31.040 --> 30:34.120
We want to know what it was that he found.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.710
The gold dish?

30:36.760 --> 30:38.500
- Small?
- Yes.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.750
- Where?
- On The Scimitar building site.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.390
That's all we know.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.390
We don't know anything else.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.510
What did he do with it?

30:54.560 --> 30:58.270
He said he'd sell it to someone
called... John Gulliver.

30:58.320 --> 30:59.910
- Gulliver.
- We know him.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.790
- He's dead.
- We KNEW him.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.110
How did he know Gulliver?

31:04.160 --> 31:06.760
One of the guys told me about him.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.830
He'd buy stuff and he
wouldn't ask questions.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.230
Did you meet him?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.830
No.

31:13.880 --> 31:17.550
He thought it might be worth
something. That's all.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.670
- Maybe £50.
- Why did you deny it?

31:21.720 --> 31:23.790
Why didn't you tell me?

31:24.920 --> 31:27.030
We sent him to Gulliver.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.880
Adam gets killed and then we see this.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.590
We were scared. We didn't
want to be involved.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.840
This is Gulliver?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.670
Let her go.

31:40.720 --> 31:43.920
Get back in your car.
Mind your own business.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.040
I know him.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.510
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

31:56.560 --> 32:00.110
No, I don't want a drink,
Raymond, I just want the truth.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.110
What do you mean? I told
you everything I know.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.470
No, you didn't.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.670
How long did you work for me? Five years?

32:07.720 --> 32:11.020
You think I couldn't
tell when you were lying?

32:13.720 --> 32:15.240
I can't.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.950
Are you scared?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.870
You don't know these people.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.320
Tell me.

32:26.720 --> 32:30.990
- There's a man called Craig.
- Craig? - That's what he said.

32:31.040 --> 32:35.230
Ex-Army. Nasty piece of work.
I'd never seen him before

32:35.280 --> 32:38.270
- but he knew all about me.
- That you'd been in prison.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.870
I'd have lost my job.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.590
I'd have lost everything
if I didn't do what he said.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.790
But I swear to you, Derek, I
didn't know anyone would get hurt.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.120
For Christ sake, Raymond, what did you do?

32:51.760 --> 32:53.590
I need a piss.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.270
You're not going to run out on me?

32:56.320 --> 32:58.630
Why would I do that, eh?

32:58.680 --> 33:00.950
Just give me a minute, eh?

33:07.640 --> 33:10.960
I'll have a large Scotch.
Stick it on his tab.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.480
Ta.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.710
Derek!

33:27.760 --> 33:29.590
Derek...

33:29.640 --> 33:31.560
Raymond...

33:39.880 --> 33:41.360
Hey!

33:42.680 --> 33:43.960
Shit.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.030
Stay still, you stupid bastard.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.350
I'll get you an ambulance.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.510
They're still lying.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.310
- Who?
- Roman and Eva.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.469
Look, they said the dish that Adam found

34:42.520 --> 34:45.310
was only worth 50 quid. But
we know he got paid 800.

34:45.360 --> 34:49.760
- And he got a new phone.
- Right, and they're lying because...

34:50.239 --> 34:51.710
There were two of them.

34:51.760 --> 34:54.310
Two dishes. They've got the other one.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.389
That's the only way it makes sense.

34:56.440 --> 34:59.750
Adam sells his and gets killed.
Roman has to keep quiet.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.630
And that's why Karen's
place got ransacked.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.150
Someone's still looking for it.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.150
What are we doing here?

35:12.040 --> 35:13.190
'It's simple.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.990
'Adam finds a dish and
sells it to Gulliver.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.070
'Adam's blown up.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.660
'Gulliver threatens the Wesleys.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.460
'He burns to death.'

35:25.360 --> 35:28.430
'The Wesleys are connected to Matherson.'

35:28.480 --> 35:29.950
And...?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.160
I want Matherson.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.830
So I need to check the manifest

35:36.880 --> 35:39.350
to find out exactly what's on that boat.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.800
How are you going to do that?

36:11.760 --> 36:14.230
- This is crazy.
- What?

36:14.280 --> 36:16.520
We're trespassing.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.030
We're breaking the law.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.470
You shouldn't have come.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.620
- You didn't give me any choice.
- Come on!

36:29.320 --> 36:32.260
Look, this has got nothing to do with me.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.920
OK...

36:40.240 --> 36:41.720
Rash?

36:47.760 --> 36:49.630
Rash?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.640
Rash!

37:37.080 --> 37:39.080
I don't believe this.

37:40.560 --> 37:42.670
This is not happening.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.360
Are you OK?

37:45.400 --> 37:47.830
No, I'm not OK!

37:50.600 --> 37:53.680
- My head really hurts.
- Mine too.

37:57.160 --> 38:01.150
I don't even know why I'm here.
This has got nothing to do with me.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.350
I know. You said.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.190
You know, ever since I met you,

38:06.240 --> 38:10.430
my life has taken a serious turn downhill.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.480
Hi.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.240
Who are you?

38:50.720 --> 38:53.880
I was about to ask you the same thing.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.470
I'm a police officer. And I
warn you, you're guilty of

38:57.520 --> 39:00.710
false imprisonment by detaining
us here and probably kidnapping.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.070
- Which carries a sentence
of life imprisonment. - Right.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.510
Added to which, you're
assaulting me as a police officer.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.630
And are you going to tell
me you're police as well?

39:07.680 --> 39:10.430
- Yeah. I'm with the Serious Fraud Office.
- We know who you are.

39:10.480 --> 39:14.480
- We know everything about you.
- You don't know my name.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.310
Yeah, OK. But we now you were
involved in the death of Adam Jannsen.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.870
- Yeah, and James Gulliver.
- John Gulliver!

39:20.920 --> 39:22.710
And the Wesleys are involved.

39:22.760 --> 39:26.590
- The Scimitar.
- All right. You know something.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.940
- So, you've got to let us go.
- I don't agree.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.270
What are you going to do?

39:32.320 --> 39:35.950
I've got nothing against you
personally, but this is my job.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.720
I've got to find out what you
know. Who you're working for.

39:40.840 --> 39:44.030
- Then I've got to get rid of you.
- What, are you going to kill us?

39:44.080 --> 39:49.390
- In cold blood? - Yeah, it's what
I get paid to do. 10 grand a time.

39:49.440 --> 39:53.440
- It gets to be a bit of a
habit, after a while. - Wait!

39:54.160 --> 39:55.350
What now?

39:55.400 --> 39:57.140
I'm a Catholic.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.560
- So what?
- I want to pray.

40:03.160 --> 40:06.110
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. It matters to me.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.550
All right. Get on with it.
I'll give you a minute.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.150
And while you're doing that,
I'll kill your friend.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.550
- What! - The trouble is,
I can't do it standing up.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.830
OK. You want me to untie you?
Just get on with it, all right?

40:17.880 --> 40:22.390
- If you kill us, you'll never get
what you want. - Now, what's that?

40:22.440 --> 40:26.920
What you're looking for. It's
why you killed Adam Jannsen.

40:28.440 --> 40:30.790
He found it on a building site.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.910
It's small, it's round, it's
gold, shaped like a dish.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.590
He sold it to John Gulliver.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.790
And Gulliver used it
to threaten the Wesleys.

40:38.840 --> 40:42.040
And you got it back
when you killed Gulliver.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.230
But there were two of them, weren't there?

40:44.280 --> 40:47.220
That's why you broke into Karen's place?

40:47.480 --> 40:49.270
But it wasn't there.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.510
It was too late. She'd
already given it to us.

40:52.560 --> 40:56.150
- So, where is it now? - Obviously
we're not going to tell you. - Whoa!

40:56.200 --> 40:59.350
If you let us go, we'll take you to it.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.750
We'll take you to it and we'll give
you two hours to make your getaway.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.270
And that's it. That's the deal.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.720
- So, you've got it?
- Yeah.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.710
Well, that changes things.

41:11.240 --> 41:14.360
- Thought it might.
- I can't kill you after all.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.440
Not if you ever want to see it again.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.630
I'm going to have to talk to you
first. Make you tell me where it is.

41:26.680 --> 41:29.670
- And then I'm going to kill you.
- Do what you want.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.590
We're not going to tell you anything.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.750
Really? Oh, OK.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.540
I think this might change your mind.

41:38.200 --> 41:42.390
You have no idea what
I can and can't do...

41:42.440 --> 41:45.470
Both knees... elbows.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.150
Listen, I want to know what you know.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.200
So, which one of you is going to be first?

41:52.560 --> 41:54.840
- Start with him.
- What?

41:58.480 --> 42:01.590
- He's got it! - No, I
haven't! - It's in his van.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.190
Where?

42:03.240 --> 42:05.070
It's parked outside on the quay.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.590
- It's a white builder's van.
It's in the back. - Parked where?

42:07.640 --> 42:09.430
A five-minute walk away.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.280
Over by the gate.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.200
- Where's the keys?
- It's open. It's open.

42:18.640 --> 42:23.110
And it's definitely there? Cos, you
two, you aren't going anywhere.

42:23.160 --> 42:26.110
When I come back, if I find out
you're lying to me, really, I am,

42:26.160 --> 42:29.190
I'm going to do things to you
that you wouldn't want to imagine.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.780
It's there.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.790
All right.

42:34.960 --> 42:38.390
You're on your own down
here. No-one can hear you.

42:38.440 --> 42:40.510
And there's no way out.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.840
Oh...

42:45.480 --> 42:47.020
One second.

42:59.480 --> 43:03.160
No way you can reach them,
but, you know, best to be sure.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.150
That's my new phone!

43:11.200 --> 43:13.280
Why did you do that?

43:24.040 --> 43:25.750
Back soon.

43:25.800 --> 43:29.030
Help! Someone!

43:29.080 --> 43:31.870
- Hey! - All right! They can't hear you.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.520
You could be a bit more positive.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.080
This was his?

43:47.440 --> 43:50.870
- I've got another phone in my jacket.
- What, you've got two phones?

43:50.920 --> 43:54.470
Well, not normally. I've
still got Adam's phone.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.310
Karen gave it to me.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.150
You can't reach it.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.120
No.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.440
But you can.

44:18.800 --> 44:19.940
Oh!

44:21.440 --> 44:23.110
My ribs!

44:23.160 --> 44:25.550
Oh, all right, just find the phone!

44:25.600 --> 44:29.700
- Yeah, I can feel it.
- It's right in front of your foot.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.870
- It's coming, it's coming.
- OK.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.470
Just don't let it drop.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.920
I'm not going to let it drop.

44:56.760 --> 45:00.910
- Why did you have to drop it?
- I didn't drop it on purpose!

45:00.960 --> 45:05.680
- He's coming back! - I know he's
coming back, but I can't reach it.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.350
Wait a minute.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.200
I'll use my shoe.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.080
That's good.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.720
I've got it!

45:28.440 --> 45:32.470
- Is it on? - Yep. - We can
call the police. - That's right.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.430
How are you going to dial?

45:34.480 --> 45:37.760
- With my toes.
- Oh, good work, mate.

45:54.760 --> 45:58.230
- Have you done it? - I'm doing it
now. It's not easy. - Well, it's 999.

45:58.280 --> 46:01.680
Well, I know the number. Yeah?
I'm doing it with my toes.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.030
'Emergency, which service?'

46:10.080 --> 46:12.550
- You've done it!
- I did it!

46:14.480 --> 46:17.910
- We need the police! We're on a ship.
- I'm DC Sayyad, I'm being held against my will.

46:17.960 --> 46:20.390
He's coming for us. He's got
a gun. We've been kidnapped.

46:20.440 --> 46:23.190
- Will you shut up. I'm telling them!
- I'm telling them!

46:23.240 --> 46:25.870
They can't hear us if we
both shout at the same time.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.190
- All right.
- Right.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.910
- Suspect...
- We need the police!

46:45.000 --> 46:46.630
You lied to me.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.870
Look, it's there.

46:47.920 --> 46:49.550
No, it's not.

46:49.600 --> 46:53.910
- OK! It's not in the van, but we know
who's got it. - But we can't tell you.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.270
- Why not? - Because if we tell
you, you'll go and kill them.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.190
That's very noble of you, but I'm getting fed
up with this, so I'm going to kill you instead.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.630
Wait a minute! Are you going
to kill us on the Dragon Star?

47:02.680 --> 47:04.030
In the Tilbury Docks?

47:04.080 --> 47:06.470
- In the hold?
- Where we're tied up?

47:06.520 --> 47:08.550
What are you two doing?

47:08.600 --> 47:11.400
And why have you taken your shoes off?

47:18.440 --> 47:20.040
Armed police!

47:39.760 --> 47:41.630
Are you all right?

47:44.040 --> 47:45.510
It worked.

47:46.280 --> 47:49.310
- I can't believe it worked.
- What worked?

47:49.360 --> 47:52.270
We got the phone out,
we managed to call you.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.910
No, you didn't call us.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.560
He did.

47:58.600 --> 48:03.080
'Hello? Help is on its
way. Help is on its way.'

48:15.360 --> 48:18.990
- So, it turns out that you were right.
- I usually am.

48:19.040 --> 48:22.110
The Wesley brothers were
buying high-quality ragstone

48:22.160 --> 48:25.270
from the Mathersons and
paying a premium price for it.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.670
- Yes.
- Only it wasn't their product.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.470
We checked -- the family
quarry is almost empty.

48:30.520 --> 48:32.350
There's nothing left.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.390
So, where were they getting it from?

48:34.440 --> 48:37.350
Well, they were buying
it cheap from China,

48:37.400 --> 48:40.750
importing it through a shipping
company called White Dragon.

48:40.800 --> 48:44.750
When they sold it to the Wesleys,
they were making a 500% profit.

48:44.800 --> 48:47.150
Did the Wesley know they
were being ripped off?

48:47.200 --> 48:48.630
Of course they knew.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.030
So the bribe money was being paid.

48:51.080 --> 48:53.990
The Wesleys pay through the
nose for an inferior product

48:54.040 --> 48:58.190
and Matherson... and his
wife pocket the difference.

48:58.240 --> 49:00.870
Paying over the odds for a cheap product

49:00.920 --> 49:04.590
- demonstrates nothing more than
bad business sense. - Exactly.

49:04.640 --> 49:07.120
So Matherson is in the clear.

49:08.240 --> 49:12.430
I understand that this new
building has already been given

49:12.480 --> 49:15.190
the nom de plume of The Pyramid.

49:15.240 --> 49:19.230
Two years from now, it
will rise above this city,

49:19.280 --> 49:22.270
breathing new life to this area,

49:22.320 --> 49:27.430
confirming, once again, that when
it comes to dynamism and growth,

49:27.480 --> 49:30.400
London really does lead the world.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.430
This is your last chance.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.630
You give it to us now
or we go to the police.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.070
I am the police.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.260
Yeah, the proper police.

49:51.960 --> 49:55.230
Look, you can't keep
it, you can't sell it.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.270
You've got no choice.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.990
Why should we?

50:00.120 --> 50:02.260
- It's ours.
- Heather.

50:21.840 --> 50:24.710
It's what you dream of
when you're a child.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.630
A buried treasure.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.710
Do you know how hard we work...

50:32.760 --> 50:34.870
Roman and I?

50:34.920 --> 50:37.520
And do you know how much we earn?

50:40.360 --> 50:42.790
This city never gives you any chances.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.110
And then this comes along.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.080
I'm sorry.

51:11.880 --> 51:13.950
It's called an intaglio.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.200
Probably 1st century AD.

51:17.920 --> 51:21.190
These things always come in pairs.
You see? Cautes and Cautopates.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.790
Day and night. You can't
have one without the other.

51:23.840 --> 51:26.190
- You say it was found on
a building site? - Yeah.

51:26.240 --> 51:29.510
Well, there's almost certainly
something very exciting underneath.

51:29.560 --> 51:32.790
A Mithraic temple.
Perhaps an entire complex.

51:32.840 --> 51:34.950
I just hope they have insurance.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.350
Unexpected archaeological
discovery insurance.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.360
You don't have it.

51:43.040 --> 51:46.550
Of course we do. We'd be mad not to.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.340
No, we checked.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.070
You didn't bother.

51:52.200 --> 51:55.150
No. Louis would have told me.

51:55.200 --> 51:59.360
I think there are a lot of
things Louis didn't tell you.

52:06.840 --> 52:08.670
You're right.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.950
- We didn't.
- Why?

52:11.000 --> 52:12.870
To save the money.

52:14.240 --> 52:17.110
And that's why Adam Jannsen had to die.

52:19.280 --> 52:22.880
He found an antique -- a golden medallion.

52:24.840 --> 52:26.390
He showed it to John Gulliver

52:26.440 --> 52:29.230
and Gulliver guessed what
it would be worth to you.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.830
A find like that could
shut you down for years.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.310
Without insurance, you'd be dead ducks.

52:34.360 --> 52:37.310
He tried to blackmail you
so you had him killed...

52:37.360 --> 52:40.750
by the same person who
killed Adam Jannsen.

52:40.800 --> 52:44.590
You also planned the
murder of Raymond Keane.

52:44.640 --> 52:47.430
He's not dead. And he'll talk.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.670
And finally, you were
responsible for the kidnap

52:50.720 --> 52:53.550
and attempted murder
of one of my detectives.

52:53.600 --> 52:57.430
I understand that the person who
actually committed these crimes is dead.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.630
That's right.

52:59.680 --> 53:03.150
Then, forgive me,
Detective, but I would say

53:03.200 --> 53:06.800
that you have nothing that
connects me to any of this.

53:08.880 --> 53:10.620
That's not true.

53:11.480 --> 53:16.070
DNA from the chewing gum found at
the building site gives us Craig.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.390
Craig leads us to you.

53:18.440 --> 53:21.150
You met in the Territorial Army.

53:21.200 --> 53:25.720
You were both in the 47th
London Infantry Division.

53:27.120 --> 53:30.470
We have large payments
recovered from his house.

53:30.520 --> 53:33.280
Your fingerprints are all over them.

53:39.600 --> 53:41.560
Can I talk to Ellie?

53:43.760 --> 53:46.560
Would that be possible, do you think?

53:47.080 --> 53:49.150
I just want to explain.

53:57.840 --> 53:59.870
And the Scimitar?

53:59.920 --> 54:04.230
The site has already been designated
an area of archaeological interest.

54:04.280 --> 54:08.670
All work has been suspended for the
next 15 weeks for rescue excavation.

54:08.720 --> 54:11.760
The whole project has collapsed.
It's never going to be built.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.030
What a great shame.

54:16.080 --> 54:19.710
Which brings us back to the
question of high-rises in London.

54:19.760 --> 54:23.190
You know, Marcus, my head of
investigation, he hates them.

54:23.240 --> 54:25.510
He thinks they're destroying the city.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.070
Oh, I don't agree.

54:27.120 --> 54:30.150
I think they're revitalising London.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.270
They're the future.

54:31.320 --> 54:33.630
Hmm. I've heard you say that many times...

54:33.680 --> 54:35.280
on record.

54:39.160 --> 54:40.870
The Scimitar.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.120
Yep.

54:43.320 --> 54:48.510
You can actually see the site where
it was going to be built from here.

54:48.560 --> 54:51.150
Yeah, I believe so.

54:51.200 --> 54:55.510
Yes, if it had gone up, it
would have gone up right there.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.070
Right in front of you.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.060
Spoiling your view.

55:01.160 --> 55:04.860
Wouldn't have been great
for the value of your flat.

55:07.320 --> 55:09.550
I hope you're not suggesting...

55:09.600 --> 55:12.270
I'm not suggesting anything, Peter.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.640
Goodbye.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.470
So...?

55:31.520 --> 55:33.470
You told her then?

55:33.520 --> 55:34.710
What?

55:34.760 --> 55:36.080
Karen.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.790
Oh, yeah.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.070
I didn't want the room anyway.

55:41.120 --> 55:45.520
Would've been a bit creepy...
knowing the guy who died.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.430
So it's free?

55:48.480 --> 55:50.040
Yeah.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.230
Did you take it?

55:53.280 --> 55:55.830
Well, we got on really well.

55:55.880 --> 55:57.590
It's a nice house.

55:57.640 --> 56:00.670
- You lied to me!
- Oh, forget it. I didn't want it.

56:00.720 --> 56:02.360
Too small.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.190
And all those teddy bears.

56:05.240 --> 56:06.980
Yeah. Sebastien.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.520
Fergie.

56:10.560 --> 56:11.670
Bruno.

56:11.720 --> 56:13.070
Eddie.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.830
Eddie?

56:14.880 --> 56:16.680
Eddie the Teddy.

56:20.960 --> 56:24.070
We'll find somewhere.

56:24.120 --> 56:26.460
There's got to be somewhere.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.390
Somewhere.

56:29.440 --> 56:30.880
Yeah.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.190
Right, come on.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.910
