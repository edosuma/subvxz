WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:01.702
My siblings and I

00:01.704 --> 00:04.348
are the first vampires
in all of history,

00:04.350 --> 00:05.866
The Originals.

00:05.868 --> 00:09.570
Unlike them, I am a hybrid...
half vampire, half werewolf.

00:09.572 --> 00:12.823
300 years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

00:12.825 --> 00:15.910
Now we've returned, drawn back
by a coven of witches

00:15.912 --> 00:18.545
who threaten the woman
carrying my child.

00:18.547 --> 00:20.998
That baby will bring
death to us all.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.499
Aah! Aah!

00:22.501 --> 00:24.301
My brother
Elijah dealt with them.

00:24.303 --> 00:28.005
No one hurts
my family and lives.

00:28.007 --> 00:29.673
We thought
Hayley would be safe.

00:29.675 --> 00:31.225
I'm Marcel.

00:31.227 --> 00:33.177
I don't think
we've met.

00:33.179 --> 00:34.595
Hayley is gone.
Where is she?

00:34.597 --> 00:35.980
What?

00:35.982 --> 00:38.148
Marcel was here.

00:38.150 --> 00:40.684
We were wrong.

01:07.045 --> 01:10.130
Ladies, gentlemen,

01:10.132 --> 01:12.383
welcome to fight night...

01:17.889 --> 01:20.274
And the first rule
of fight night is,

01:20.276 --> 01:23.027
the vampire left standing
at the end of the night

01:23.029 --> 01:25.729
is one step closer
to the inner circle

01:25.731 --> 01:29.817
and one of these...
a daylight ring.

01:29.819 --> 01:33.454
If you can impress me
with a little ultra-violence,

01:33.456 --> 01:37.574
you too can enjoy the warmth
of the sun on your face.

01:37.576 --> 01:41.245
All you got to do
is kick a little ass.

01:42.248 --> 01:45.282
So here we go.

01:48.253 --> 01:50.787
Our first two contenders...

01:50.789 --> 01:54.174
Felicia and Otto.

01:56.061 --> 01:57.728
Ha ha ha!

02:27.843 --> 02:31.211
Whoo!
Damn, girl, not bad.

02:37.635 --> 02:41.271
Good evening.
I'd like a word.

02:41.273 --> 02:42.806
What do you think
you're doing?

02:42.808 --> 02:45.359
It appears
that we've interrupted

02:45.361 --> 02:49.179
a collection
of filthy amateurs.

02:50.949 --> 02:52.533
We've come here
for the girl.

02:52.535 --> 02:56.487
Give her to us,
or...We kill everyone here.

02:58.490 --> 03:01.658
You two got
a lot of nerve

03:01.660 --> 03:04.461
coming into my home
and making demands.

03:04.463 --> 03:05.964
You're home,
is it?

03:05.965 --> 03:09.299
The girl.
I will not ask again.

03:09.301 --> 03:11.468
I assume you're
talking about Hayley...

03:11.470 --> 03:15.172
yay high, dark hair,
bitchy attitude.

03:15.174 --> 03:16.974
Who is she, anyway?

03:16.976 --> 03:18.592
She's an old friend.

03:18.594 --> 03:22.012
You know how sentimental
I am about old friends.

03:22.014 --> 03:23.931
Well, I ain't
got her,

03:23.933 --> 03:26.016
and before you
start whining,

03:26.018 --> 03:28.152
I did pay her a little
visit last night.

03:28.154 --> 03:29.820
I was feeling
nostalgic.

03:29.822 --> 03:32.122
So I took a trip out
to the plantation

03:32.124 --> 03:34.658
where I used to be
a slave,

03:34.660 --> 03:38.529
and imagine my surprise
when I realized

03:38.531 --> 03:41.081
that the Original
family of vampires

03:41.083 --> 03:43.450
had taken up
residence.

03:43.452 --> 03:45.986
Your girl Hayley
answered the door.

03:45.988 --> 03:48.839
We exchanged hellos.
That was it.

03:48.841 --> 03:50.791
You don't believe me,
look around.

03:50.793 --> 03:52.376
Hell, I'll even
help you find her,

03:52.378 --> 03:54.845
but the question
I'd ask is,

03:54.847 --> 03:58.048
if Hayley
isn't here,

03:58.050 --> 04:00.801
then where is she?

04:15.817 --> 04:17.267
Uh!

04:31.049 --> 04:34.084
Uh! Uh!

04:34.086 --> 04:35.919
Seriously?

04:35.921 --> 04:38.388
You don't want
to fight me, Hayley.

04:38.390 --> 04:40.424
You know you can't
beat a hybrid.

04:40.426 --> 04:43.093
Aah! Let me go,

04:43.095 --> 04:45.679
you backstabbing,
half-breed piece of sh...

04:45.681 --> 04:47.514
shut up!

04:54.012 --> 04:56.217
Sync & corrections by <font color="#00ff00">Rafael UPD</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.Addic7ed.Com/</font>

04:56.218 --> 04:57.807
Not the most
attractive community,

04:57.809 --> 04:59.076
are they?

04:59.078 --> 05:00.694
You do realize
they can hear you.

05:00.696 --> 05:04.114
You do realize
I don't care.

05:04.116 --> 05:08.619
You know, Elijah,
I liked you better in that box,

05:08.621 --> 05:11.455
but, Klaus, my sire,
you I owe the world,

05:11.457 --> 05:14.758
and I always show
respect to my elders.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.177
If your special
lady friend is missing,

05:17.179 --> 05:19.379
you can benefit
from the help of a witch,

05:19.381 --> 05:22.382
and since I control
all the witches in this town,

05:22.384 --> 05:25.185
I'll Grant you one
little locator spell.

05:25.187 --> 05:27.337
Sabine is the best guide
in the quarter.

05:27.338 --> 05:29.273
You need to find someone,

05:29.275 --> 05:32.359
I guarantee
she's your girl.

05:32.361 --> 05:34.561
Where are you
going?

05:34.563 --> 05:37.531
I hate to cut this short,
but the sun is coming up soon.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.149
My nightwalkers
need to get inside,

05:39.151 --> 05:40.901
and I've got
a city to run.

05:40.903 --> 05:44.020
I'll leave you to track down
your lost sheep.

05:49.661 --> 05:51.278
Can you find her?

05:51.280 --> 05:53.914
I can try.

06:03.725 --> 06:06.176
What is this place?

06:06.178 --> 06:09.930
The armpit
of Louisiana.

06:09.932 --> 06:11.982
What are you gonna
do with that?

06:11.984 --> 06:13.600
Depends on you.

06:13.602 --> 06:16.353
Hey, you attacked
me, remember?

06:16.355 --> 06:19.022
You ambushed me
in my own back yard.

06:19.024 --> 06:21.441
It's not your back yard.
It's Klaus'.

06:21.443 --> 06:23.910
You're shacked up in
a mansion with that psycho,

06:23.912 --> 06:25.779
a long way from the girl
I met in the appalachians

06:25.781 --> 06:27.281
helping
other werewolves.

06:27.283 --> 06:29.616
Tyler, I'm sorry,
but a lot has happened

06:29.618 --> 06:31.335
since the last time
I saw you.

06:31.337 --> 06:34.121
You mean like
how you're pregnant?

06:35.507 --> 06:39.092
A hybrid baby. Yeah.
I know all about it.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.794
I've been roaming
around the bayou

06:40.796 --> 06:42.629
asking questions.

06:42.631 --> 06:44.598
Let me tell you
what I learned.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.266
This crescent birthmark
means you come

06:46.268 --> 06:48.885
from a big shot family,
some kind of royalty

06:48.887 --> 06:50.554
to the werewolves
of this region,

06:50.556 --> 06:52.973
and right here,

06:52.975 --> 06:56.526
this is all
that's left of them.

07:02.984 --> 07:05.319
Hey, help me.

07:06.154 --> 07:08.238
They can't help you.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.990
They're in
the woods hiding

07:09.992 --> 07:11.208
because they've
been persecuted

07:11.210 --> 07:13.877
for decades
by vampires.

07:13.879 --> 07:17.581
Is that her?

07:17.583 --> 07:21.451
Yeah, Dwayne.
Get her inside.

07:21.453 --> 07:23.887
Tyler? Tyler?

07:32.897 --> 07:35.399
She's in
the back country,

07:35.401 --> 07:38.251
way out past houma,
deep in the bayou.

07:38.253 --> 07:40.637
I don't suppose
you could be more precise.

07:40.639 --> 07:41.655
What's the matter, Elijah,

07:41.657 --> 07:43.190
are you worried a bit suppose
of splashing about in the bog

07:43.192 --> 07:45.325
might ruin
your expensive shoes?

07:45.327 --> 07:47.361
As a matter of fact,
after my recent confinement,

07:47.363 --> 07:49.579
I could use a decent stroll
through the countryside.

07:49.581 --> 07:52.449
There are stories of
exiled werewolves,

07:52.451 --> 07:55.168
encampments.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.370
If Hayley went out
that far,

07:56.372 --> 07:58.288
chances are, she
went to find them.

07:58.290 --> 07:59.706
Clearly, she hopes to make
the acquaintance

07:59.708 --> 08:01.291
of more like herself.

08:01.293 --> 08:04.661
I suppose our company
wasn't good enough for her.

08:22.563 --> 08:25.232
You could always
join them, you know.

08:25.234 --> 08:28.819
Uh, drinking games.

08:28.821 --> 08:30.704
It's not really
my thing.

08:30.706 --> 08:33.240
It kind of reminds me of
the jocks in my High School.

08:33.241 --> 08:35.692
We had a pretty high quota
of what you'd call

08:35.693 --> 08:37.626
douche nozzles.

08:37.629 --> 08:40.580
Bullies, huh?
Yeah.

08:40.582 --> 08:42.999
Wonder what'd happen if
you saw those guys now.

08:43.001 --> 08:45.034
I bet you'd tear
them apart, right?

08:45.036 --> 08:47.838
Ah, yeah, totally.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.341
Ha! Probably go
all vamp ninja on them.

08:51.343 --> 08:54.644
Ha ha ha! You're
a funny guy, Josh.

08:54.646 --> 08:56.813
In fact, I thought
it was really

08:56.815 --> 08:59.349
funny last night,
you know,

08:59.351 --> 09:01.050
seeing you
at that plantation

09:01.052 --> 09:04.855
where Klaus
is staying.

09:04.857 --> 09:08.241
Ho ho! Ha ha ha!

09:08.243 --> 09:11.394
You going
somewhere, Josh?

09:14.081 --> 09:17.033
We should head south
towards the water.

09:17.035 --> 09:19.536
You seem quite determined
to find the little wolf.

09:19.538 --> 09:20.921
If I'm moving too fast
for you, Niklaus,

09:20.923 --> 09:22.923
you're welcome
to wait in the car.

09:22.925 --> 09:25.208
Do be certain to leave
the windows down.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.427
Ah, so I've
touched a nerve.

09:27.429 --> 09:29.679
You've begun
to admire this girl.

09:29.681 --> 09:31.598
Perhaps that's why
you've been barking orders

09:31.600 --> 09:33.967
since your return,
hoping to impress Hayley

09:33.969 --> 09:36.102
by assuming the role
of family patriarch.

09:36.104 --> 09:37.187
You want to insist
on treating her

09:37.189 --> 09:38.271
like a walking
incubator,

09:38.273 --> 09:41.691
then that's
your mistake.

09:41.693 --> 09:45.312
Have you
found her scent?

09:45.314 --> 09:48.448
No...

09:48.450 --> 09:51.151
But I found
someone else's.

09:51.153 --> 09:53.653
This vehicle reeks

09:53.655 --> 09:57.941
of someone I thought
I was rid of...

09:57.943 --> 10:00.911
Tyler Lockwood.

10:00.913 --> 10:02.996
And why would your
little hybrid sidekick

10:02.998 --> 10:05.131
from Mystic Falls have
any interest in Hayley?

10:05.133 --> 10:09.202
He wants revenge because
I went after his girl.

10:09.204 --> 10:10.587
Why do I suspect
this is the least

10:10.589 --> 10:11.838
of your offenses?

10:11.840 --> 10:14.123
Back when I had the means
to sire hybrids,

10:14.125 --> 10:16.676
he was my first,

10:16.678 --> 10:22.148
although I didn't give him
much choice in the matter.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.935
He was loyal
in the beginning,

10:24.937 --> 10:26.653
but he grew
insubordinate,

10:26.655 --> 10:28.271
turned my other hybrids
against me.

10:28.273 --> 10:30.440
I couldn't have that.

10:30.442 --> 10:34.077
So I massacred
the lot of them.

10:35.613 --> 10:38.081
Tyler ran
like a coward

10:38.083 --> 10:39.783
before I could
finish him off.

10:39.785 --> 10:43.253
Anything else that
you would like to share?

10:43.255 --> 10:46.322
Well, there was
this business with his mum.

10:48.009 --> 10:51.261
You killed his mother.
Wonderful.

10:51.263 --> 10:53.046
He needed to be
taught a lesson.

10:53.048 --> 10:54.431
And what lesson will
you be taught, Niklaus,

10:54.433 --> 10:56.466
if he retaliates
by harming Hayley?

10:56.468 --> 11:00.437
So you do care about her.
Well, go on, then.

11:00.439 --> 11:02.022
Have at it, brother.
Save her.

11:02.024 --> 11:03.390
Claim what spoils
you can.

11:03.392 --> 11:04.641
I've sampled what
she has to offer,

11:04.643 --> 11:06.776
and, let me tell you,
she is exquisite.

11:06.778 --> 11:08.194
Niklaus,
so help me...

11:08.196 --> 11:10.814
enough.

11:10.816 --> 11:14.183
I'll kill
Tyler Lockwood myself.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.935
Marcel,
something is happening.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.437
There's a witch doing
magic in the quarter.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.572
Oh, no worries.
That one is Marcel-approved.

11:30.574 --> 11:32.608
Besides...
Oh!

11:32.610 --> 11:35.577
Got something else
for you to handle.

11:41.918 --> 11:45.454
Oh, no. You're
the super witch.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.489
Say hi to Josh.

11:47.491 --> 11:49.425
Why would you
bring him here?

11:49.427 --> 11:51.043
Josh has a problem.

11:51.045 --> 11:53.128
Klaus compelled him
to spy on me.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.663
Agh!

11:54.665 --> 11:56.098
I can't have that.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.434
So I thought,
"I'll just kill Josh."

11:58.436 --> 12:00.602
Marcel, please.
It's not my fault.

12:00.604 --> 12:02.104
Then I thought,
"killing a vampire,

12:02.106 --> 12:03.839
that would be breaking
my own rule."

12:03.841 --> 12:05.774
Smart thing to do
is to flip Josh.

12:05.776 --> 12:08.277
That way, he can tell Klaus
whatever I want.

12:08.279 --> 12:09.895
He could even
spy for me.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.114
All we got to do
is wipe away that compulsion.

12:12.116 --> 12:14.483
So what do you think?

12:14.485 --> 12:16.652
I can make him forget
what Klaus told him,

12:16.654 --> 12:18.787
but the more
Klaus said,

12:18.789 --> 12:20.489
the more it's
gonna hurt.

12:20.491 --> 12:23.542
Hmm, probably gonna
hurt a lot.

12:23.544 --> 12:25.711
Josh?

12:25.713 --> 12:27.713
I'll do it,

12:27.715 --> 12:30.499
anything, yes.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.968
How much pain
are we talking?

13:38.852 --> 13:41.520
R...
anything, yes.

13:41.522 --> 13:44.439
Klaus destroyed everything
good in my life.

13:44.441 --> 13:46.742
So I'm gonna take away
the thing he wants most.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.977
No, please,
Tyler, please.

13:48.979 --> 13:51.613
Aah!

14:03.293 --> 14:06.178
Ggh...

14:06.180 --> 14:08.130
Uh...

14:08.132 --> 14:09.998
Oh!

14:26.249 --> 14:32.187
I thought you were leaving town.
Couldn't stay away, huh?

14:32.189 --> 14:34.156
I was half past Louisiana
when I found out

14:34.158 --> 14:35.357
you invaded our home.

14:35.359 --> 14:37.159
What have you done
with Hayley?

14:37.161 --> 14:41.380
You're so hot
when you're angry.

14:41.382 --> 14:42.831
Uh!

14:45.181 --> 14:47.766
You used me.

14:47.768 --> 14:49.517
I'm pretty sure
that was mutual.

14:49.519 --> 14:52.020
Beguiled by your charms,
I slept with you like a fool,

14:52.022 --> 14:54.555
led you to our home,
and then you took Hayley.

14:54.557 --> 14:56.941
Whoa, I didn't
take anybody.

14:56.943 --> 14:59.360
I already sorted this
out with your brothers,

14:59.362 --> 15:01.746
but it begs
the question,

15:01.748 --> 15:04.032
why'd you come back?

15:04.034 --> 15:05.366
If Klaus learns
it's my fault

15:05.368 --> 15:06.835
you found your way
to the plantation...

15:06.837 --> 15:08.703
you really think
I'd rat you out?

15:08.705 --> 15:10.038
Come on.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.756
If you think that
I'd ever in 1,000 years

15:11.758 --> 15:14.008
do anything to hurt you,

15:14.010 --> 15:17.045
you got me confused
with Klaus.

15:17.047 --> 15:21.749
All your charms
and flirtations

15:21.751 --> 15:24.202
simply prove you're
every bit the liar

15:24.204 --> 15:26.638
and manipulator
that Klaus is.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.056
Is that what
you really think?

15:28.058 --> 15:31.059
By all means,
prove me wrong.

15:31.061 --> 15:34.979
Fine. Come on.

15:34.981 --> 15:38.950
Something
you need to see.

15:47.209 --> 15:49.360
Don't get all judgey.

15:49.362 --> 15:52.113
Dwayne knew what
he was getting into.

15:52.115 --> 15:53.581
He volunteered.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.216
For you to kill him?

15:55.218 --> 15:57.836
Dwayne is a werewolf who died
with your blood in his system,

15:57.838 --> 16:01.172
same blood you share
with your hybrid baby.

16:01.174 --> 16:04.292
You're trying
to turn him.

16:04.294 --> 16:06.060
That's impossible.

16:06.062 --> 16:08.346
Been running with wolf packs
all over the country.

16:08.348 --> 16:10.631
One of them was tight
with a witch.

16:10.633 --> 16:12.534
She had nightmare visions
about your baby

16:12.536 --> 16:13.768
and how Klaus could
use its blood

16:13.770 --> 16:15.136
to make an army
of hybrid slaves.

16:15.138 --> 16:17.105
I am sick
of these witches

16:17.107 --> 16:19.107
and the premonitions
about my baby.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.641
It's just a baby.

16:20.643 --> 16:23.695
Maybe. Maybe not.

16:23.697 --> 16:25.313
That's where
Dwayne comes in.

16:25.315 --> 16:27.315
You see, he was happy
to be the test case.

16:27.317 --> 16:28.482
If you haven't noticed,
these people

16:28.484 --> 16:29.868
don't have much
to live for.

16:29.870 --> 16:31.152
They'd all welcome
the chance to become

16:31.154 --> 16:32.787
the superior species.

16:32.789 --> 16:36.875
Trouble is, all hybrids
are sired to Klaus.

16:36.877 --> 16:40.044
They follow
his every move.

16:40.046 --> 16:43.131
No way I'd
let that happen.

16:44.550 --> 16:47.001
How can you be
so sure Klaus knows

16:47.003 --> 16:48.770
what the baby's
blood will do?

16:48.772 --> 16:50.188
What do you think?

16:50.190 --> 16:51.556
Klaus Mikaelson...

16:51.558 --> 16:52.891
killer of men,
women, and puppies...

16:52.893 --> 16:54.392
all of a sudden
wants to be a daddy,

16:54.394 --> 16:58.479
or he's got
an ulterior motive.

16:58.481 --> 17:00.315
Hybrids can walk
in the sun.

17:00.317 --> 17:02.450
Their bite is lethal
to vampires.

17:02.452 --> 17:04.234
They'll take over New Orleans
by the end of the week,

17:04.237 --> 17:07.454
and you know what's
gonna stop Klaus then?

17:07.457 --> 17:09.540
Nothing.

17:16.832 --> 17:18.665
You're gonna have
to feed on her.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.202
What? No.

17:21.204 --> 17:23.204
Aah...

17:23.205 --> 17:25.705
do it.

17:27.227 --> 17:29.811
No. No! Aah!

17:29.813 --> 17:32.063
Aah!

17:33.683 --> 17:35.233
Dwayne...
easy.

17:45.828 --> 17:50.248
You're ok.
Look at me.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.417
You're ok.

17:55.005 --> 17:57.105
Look at me.
Look at me.

18:03.596 --> 18:05.746
You're ok.

18:09.518 --> 18:13.421
I'm better than ok.

18:19.982 --> 18:24.101
Aagh!

18:24.103 --> 18:25.954
Aagh!

18:25.956 --> 18:28.289
I'm sorry, but it's
just gonna get worse.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.442
Klaus' compulsion
runs deep.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.494
You need to think
of something else,

18:33.496 --> 18:37.749
take your mind
off it.

18:37.751 --> 18:40.501
Do you like music?

18:40.503 --> 18:42.553
What? What?

18:42.555 --> 18:45.840
I can't think
about music right now.

18:45.842 --> 18:47.308
Why? I don't know.

18:47.310 --> 18:49.894
Maybe because you're
giving me a voodoo lobotomy.

18:51.480 --> 18:54.015
Do you like jazz?

18:54.017 --> 18:55.400
Oh...

18:55.402 --> 18:58.369
So what, then?

18:58.371 --> 19:01.022
Club stuff...

19:01.024 --> 19:04.609
house, trance,
you know...

19:04.611 --> 19:06.127
♪ nn ss
nn ss nn ss ♪

19:06.129 --> 19:08.029
I'm a witch.
I'm not amish.

19:08.031 --> 19:11.199
It's just I'm only 16.
I don't go to clubs.

19:11.201 --> 19:15.203
When I was 16,
I'd been to 100 clubs.

19:20.209 --> 19:22.927
God, it was only
4 years ago.

19:25.047 --> 19:29.050
Feels like
another life.

19:29.052 --> 19:34.605
All I wanted to do
was meet boys.

19:34.607 --> 19:38.843
Things are so much
more complicated.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.512
I mean, now all I want
to do is meet boys

19:41.514 --> 19:44.849
and feed
on people's blood,

19:44.851 --> 19:47.235
get one of those
daylight rings

19:47.237 --> 19:51.122
so I don't burn
in the sunlight,

19:51.124 --> 19:53.741
all perfectly
normal things.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.998
I like the classics...

20:01.000 --> 20:04.886
puccini, bach, Mozart.

20:04.888 --> 20:06.921
I took piano,

20:06.923 --> 20:10.575
not that it matters
while I'm stuck here.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.727
Why not?

20:15.764 --> 20:19.734
Marcel is worried
that someone could hear.

20:19.736 --> 20:20.985
It's not his fault.

20:20.987 --> 20:24.405
He just wants
to keep me safe.

20:24.407 --> 20:26.741
Safe from what?

20:26.743 --> 20:29.894
Basically, a coven
of psycho witches

20:29.896 --> 20:32.296
want to sacrifice me
in a blood ritual.

20:32.298 --> 20:36.367
Oh, wow. Ok.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.454
Uh, I'm...Sorry.

20:39.456 --> 20:43.741
Don't be. I'm gonna
destroy them all,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.259
and once
the gone,

20:45.261 --> 20:48.179
everything will
go back to normal.

20:48.181 --> 20:51.599
I'll have
my old life back.

20:58.868 --> 21:02.871
It worked, didn't it?
He's a hybrid.

21:02.873 --> 21:04.373
If Klaus gets
a hold of you,

21:04.375 --> 21:07.643
if he gets that kid,
he wins.

21:07.645 --> 21:12.398
Then help me hide
the baby from him.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.516
Help me run.

21:14.518 --> 21:16.435
He'll find you.

21:16.437 --> 21:17.770
He'll take
your kid away,

21:17.772 --> 21:19.939
and he'll make
more hybrid monsters,

21:19.941 --> 21:21.774
slaves who do
everything he says.

21:21.776 --> 21:24.493
Tyler, whatever you're
thinking of doing,

21:24.495 --> 21:25.945
there has to be
another way.

21:25.947 --> 21:28.831
You're not
like this.

21:28.833 --> 21:32.284
Uh!
Agh! D'ugh!

21:32.286 --> 21:36.505
Agh! That was stupid.

21:36.507 --> 21:38.457
Get away
from her.

21:38.459 --> 21:39.842
What do you care?

21:39.844 --> 21:41.010
I said, get away.

21:41.012 --> 21:42.294
You got what you wanted.
Not get lost.

21:42.296 --> 21:44.913
Dwayne, he's
gonna kill me.

21:44.915 --> 21:46.382
He's gonna
kill you, too.

21:46.384 --> 21:47.582
He said that hybrids

21:47.584 --> 21:49.101
are too dangerous
to live.

21:49.103 --> 21:50.102
You need
to stop him.

21:50.104 --> 21:52.688
Shut up.
Uh!

21:54.474 --> 21:57.693
Uh!
Agh!

21:57.695 --> 22:00.229
Uh!

22:24.421 --> 22:26.171
Huh!

22:26.173 --> 22:27.890
Forgive me.

22:27.892 --> 22:30.059
Thought you
were in danger.

22:30.061 --> 22:33.646
It appears
I was mistaken.

22:39.352 --> 22:43.238
You will not believe
the crap day that I'm having.

22:45.475 --> 22:47.993
Let me
take you home.

22:47.995 --> 22:49.445
Elijah...

22:50.813 --> 22:56.752
There's something you need
to know about the baby.

22:56.754 --> 22:58.170
Hayley,

22:58.172 --> 23:00.873
don't make this harder
than it has to be.

23:02.709 --> 23:05.127
Give up now...

23:06.296 --> 23:08.681
I'll end it quick.

23:08.683 --> 23:10.499
Quite an offer,

23:10.501 --> 23:13.602
though not one I'll
be extending to you.

23:13.604 --> 23:15.554
Klaus.

23:15.556 --> 23:19.525
Hello, Tyler.
You look well.

23:19.527 --> 23:23.078
I aim
to change that.

23:28.976 --> 23:30.642
Threatening
a pregnant girl

23:30.644 --> 23:32.844
in order to exact
revenge against me.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.647
I never expected you
to sink so low.

23:35.649 --> 23:39.651
I admit,
I'm impressed.

23:39.653 --> 23:41.853
I used to hang out
with you.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.572
I guess something
must have rubbed off.

23:43.574 --> 23:45.490
What do you think
Caroline would say

23:45.492 --> 23:47.659
if she saw what
you've become?

23:47.661 --> 23:50.028
Perhaps I'll ask her
when I call her

23:50.030 --> 23:52.164
to tell her
of your demise.

23:52.166 --> 23:53.999
Whatever happens to me,

23:54.001 --> 23:57.169
Caroline is never
gonna stop hating you.

23:58.371 --> 24:02.541
Come on, mate.
Give it a bit more effort.

24:02.543 --> 24:04.543
I want to enjoy myself.

24:22.471 --> 24:24.556
What is this place?

24:24.558 --> 24:26.124
This is the garden.

24:26.126 --> 24:28.810
It's where I punish
vampires who break my rules,

24:28.812 --> 24:33.815
but a long time ago,
used to be something else.

24:37.970 --> 24:41.356
Go on.
Tell me what you see.

24:43.826 --> 24:46.528
Two stories,
Greek columns,

24:46.530 --> 24:49.164
wraparound porch,
high ceilings,

24:49.166 --> 24:51.249
transom windows.

24:51.251 --> 24:54.536
It's lovely.
So what?

24:54.538 --> 24:59.374
So I designed it for you.
It was gonna be ours.

25:03.763 --> 25:07.665
That...

25:07.667 --> 25:11.136
this was supposed to be
our happily ever after?

25:11.138 --> 25:13.338
Yours and mine,

25:13.340 --> 25:15.506
except you flew the coop
with Klaus.

25:15.508 --> 25:17.892
I already built
the foundation for the place.

25:17.894 --> 25:20.178
I halted construction
after you took off.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.397
Plan was to wait
for you to return.

25:22.399 --> 25:23.898
You never did.

25:23.900 --> 25:27.252
So now it's where I bury
the people who betray me.

25:27.254 --> 25:28.686
You could've
come after me.

25:28.688 --> 25:31.022
You were with Klaus.
I didn't know where.

25:31.024 --> 25:33.241
I didn't know if you
still wanted to be with me.

25:33.243 --> 25:34.676
All you had to do
was come home.

25:34.678 --> 25:36.211
It was more
complicated than that.

25:36.213 --> 25:37.379
Not long after
we left here,

25:37.381 --> 25:38.546
he put a dagger
in my heart

25:38.548 --> 25:40.382
and stuck me in
a box for 90 years.

25:40.384 --> 25:42.751
He stole a century from
me like it were nothing.

25:42.753 --> 25:44.452
That's what he does,
Rebekah.

25:44.454 --> 25:45.971
Klaus will never
be happy.

25:45.973 --> 25:47.205
He'll be damned if he
ever lets anyone

25:47.207 --> 25:48.757
get something that
he can't have.

25:48.759 --> 25:49.874
I know.

25:49.876 --> 25:50.992
I've been dancing
to this song

25:50.994 --> 25:52.377
for 1,000 years.

25:52.379 --> 25:55.563
Starting right now,
you have a choice

25:55.565 --> 25:57.515
between the brother who
takes away your happiness

25:57.517 --> 25:59.818
whenever he feels like it
and the man who wants

25:59.820 --> 26:02.270
to give you everything
you ever wanted.

26:06.826 --> 26:10.228
He will kill you
in front of my eyes

26:10.230 --> 26:12.247
out of spite.

26:12.249 --> 26:15.617
Not if we get
rid of him first.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.089
Klaus
must have known.

26:21.091 --> 26:24.042
That's the only
explanation.

26:24.044 --> 26:25.543
He could care less
about the baby.

26:25.545 --> 26:26.911
He just wants her
to be born

26:26.913 --> 26:29.631
so he can use her to
make more sired hybrids.

26:32.018 --> 26:35.920
Although the way
that Dwayne was acting,

26:35.922 --> 26:39.474
it was more like
he was sired to me.

26:41.193 --> 26:44.762
I should
take you home.

26:44.764 --> 26:48.033
Are you serious?
Home to what?

26:48.035 --> 26:49.818
Look. Regardless
of my brother's intentions,

26:49.820 --> 26:51.602
mine remain the same.

26:51.604 --> 26:53.872
I said that I
would protect you,

26:53.874 --> 26:56.491
even, if need be,
from Klaus himself.

26:56.493 --> 26:59.277
I can take care
of myself.

26:59.279 --> 27:01.296
I've done it
for a long time.

27:04.283 --> 27:06.968
Is this your idea
of revenge, Tyler,

27:06.970 --> 27:08.753
grueling game
of hide-and-seek?

27:08.755 --> 27:11.473
D'aagh!

27:14.560 --> 27:17.228
Rraagh!

27:21.233 --> 27:24.018
Let's end this,
shall we?

27:24.820 --> 27:27.021
Raagh!
Raagh!

27:39.324 --> 27:40.824
How dare you?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.743
I'm just
getting started.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.329
Aagh!

27:45.331 --> 27:47.080
You've grown
bloodthirsty.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.999
Perhaps it's best
your mother didn't live

27:49.001 --> 27:50.450
to see you like this.

27:50.452 --> 27:53.086
Ha ha ha!

27:56.507 --> 27:59.293
Yah!

28:00.261 --> 28:03.413
It's sad, really.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.799
I thought
I made you better.

28:05.801 --> 28:08.635
Turns out, you're
quite the disappointment.

28:08.637 --> 28:10.938
Yaah!

28:10.940 --> 28:13.106
I guess I'm another one
of your failures,

28:13.108 --> 28:15.859
like how you failed
at making hybrids,

28:15.861 --> 28:17.894
how you failed
your family.

28:20.614 --> 28:21.782
Now it looks like
you're even

28:21.784 --> 28:24.818
gonna fail
your own kid.

28:24.820 --> 28:28.655
And thus ends your
tedious, little life.

28:28.657 --> 28:30.457
At least it was brief.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.709
Yaagh! Ugh...

28:35.163 --> 28:37.280
Do it.

28:37.282 --> 28:40.050
You're never
gonna break me.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.668
Only thing you
could do is kill me.

28:41.670 --> 28:46.139
So go on. Go on.
Get it over with.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.675
Ah...

28:48.677 --> 28:53.313
You want me to end
your suffering, don't you?

28:53.315 --> 28:58.235
Hmm? I did break you,
took everything from you,

28:58.237 --> 29:00.970
and now you're begging me
to sweep away the shards

29:00.972 --> 29:04.024
of your shattered,
little life.

29:13.201 --> 29:16.420
Death offers more peace
than you deserve.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.505
It's better
to let you live,

29:18.507 --> 29:20.657
and each morning,
you will wake knowing

29:20.659 --> 29:23.510
that your wretched
existence continues

29:23.512 --> 29:27.097
only by my will.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.351
Now go and live
the rest of your days

29:31.353 --> 29:36.556
knowing you
are nothing to me.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.098
Do you know how many
fools have tried

29:45.100 --> 29:46.700
to vanquish
my brother?

29:46.702 --> 29:48.785
If you stand against
him, he will kill you,

29:48.787 --> 29:50.737
and it will be
awful and bloody,

29:50.739 --> 29:53.022
and I will not stand
around and watch.

29:53.024 --> 29:56.960
You forget I have
a secret weapon... Davina,

29:56.962 --> 29:59.413
the most powerful witch
in the last couple centuries.

29:59.415 --> 30:02.749
What if she can find
a way to kill him?

30:04.535 --> 30:07.304
You don't know,
do you?

30:07.306 --> 30:08.955
You can't
kill Klaus,

30:08.957 --> 30:11.425
not without
dying yourself.

30:11.427 --> 30:12.592
We learned it
from the deaths

30:12.594 --> 30:13.727
of my brothers
Kol and Finn.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.445
If an Original dies,
every vampire

30:15.447 --> 30:18.632
ever made from their
line dies with him.

30:18.634 --> 30:21.551
Even if you kill Klaus,
he'll still win.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.437
It's been that way
for 1,000 years.

30:23.439 --> 30:25.272
That's his trick.
He always wins.

30:25.274 --> 30:27.190
There's
another way.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.192
What would that be?

30:29.194 --> 30:31.361
We bury him
down here forever.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.729
Are you mad?

30:32.731 --> 30:34.164
This little chamber
of horrors may work

30:34.166 --> 30:35.582
for your riffraff,
but do you really think

30:35.584 --> 30:37.084
it will hold
my brother?

30:37.086 --> 30:40.737
Isn't it worth the risk?
You know I'm right.

30:40.739 --> 30:43.290
Klaus will never stop
trying to control you.

30:43.292 --> 30:45.125
And I'm supposed
to believe

30:45.127 --> 30:48.428
that after a century,
suddenly you're willing

30:48.430 --> 30:51.098
to risk death at
his hands to be with me?

30:51.100 --> 30:53.016
I want to defend
my home.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.835
I want to be free,
and if that means

30:54.837 --> 30:57.104
I get to be with you,

30:57.106 --> 30:59.189
all the more reason
to bury him.

30:59.191 --> 31:03.059
Now you tell me,
what do you want?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.032
There you are.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.284
I see you found
our wandering stray.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.953
Perhaps she could
shed some light

31:12.955 --> 31:15.489
on the situation.

31:15.491 --> 31:18.325
This...

31:18.327 --> 31:21.277
Would appear to be
the body of a hybrid.

31:21.279 --> 31:22.629
His name
was Dwayne.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.448
Well, whoever he was,
I didn't sire him.

31:25.450 --> 31:27.467
Any idea how
that's possible?

31:27.469 --> 31:30.804
As if you
didn't know.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.507
Ah...

31:33.509 --> 31:37.561
Aren't you two
fast friends?

31:37.563 --> 31:38.962
Well, come on, then.

31:38.964 --> 31:40.847
What horrible accusation
have you conspired

31:40.849 --> 31:42.849
to Levy against me?

31:42.851 --> 31:45.852
Tyler Lockwood brought Hayley
here to test a theory,

31:45.854 --> 31:50.440
that the blood of her child
could be used to sire hybrids.

31:50.442 --> 31:53.243
He claims you knew that.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.862
Furthermore,
you intended

31:55.864 --> 31:58.915
to use this knowledge
to build an army.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.484
And, of course, you
assume it's true.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.820
I mean, why else
would I show

32:03.822 --> 32:07.174
any interest in my
own flesh and blood?

32:07.176 --> 32:08.992
A heartbroken,
little crybaby

32:08.994 --> 32:10.710
points his finger at me,
and my own brother

32:10.712 --> 32:15.432
falls in line,
eager to believe it.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.101
How quickly you
assume the worst,

32:18.103 --> 32:20.353
especially when
it comes from her.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.855
Oh, spare me
you indignation.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.007
When have you ever demonstrated
any kind of concern

32:24.009 --> 32:25.559
towards Hayley
or her child

32:25.561 --> 32:28.028
beyond your own
selfish pursuits,

32:28.030 --> 32:30.197
and what was it
you once said to me?

32:30.199 --> 32:33.450
"Every King
needs an heir."

32:33.452 --> 32:35.735
My big brother,

32:35.737 --> 32:38.187
so you doubt
my intentions.

32:38.189 --> 32:41.858
Well, I can't say
I'm surprised.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.077
Standing beside
the noble Elijah,

32:44.079 --> 32:47.330
how can I be anything
but the lesser brother...

32:47.332 --> 32:52.252
a liar, a manipulator,

32:52.254 --> 32:55.055
a bastard?

32:58.976 --> 33:01.928
That's all I am
to you, isn't it,

33:01.930 --> 33:04.264
and to Rebekah,
and judging

33:04.266 --> 33:06.650
by the way Hayley hangs
on your every word,

33:06.652 --> 33:10.386
it's clear she feels
the same way.

33:10.388 --> 33:13.573
No doubt, my child
will, as well.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.742
Brother, if I...

33:15.744 --> 33:19.663
we've said all that
needs to be said,

33:19.665 --> 33:21.948
brother.

33:27.237 --> 33:31.708
I'll play the role
I've been given.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.878
Agh!
Klaus!

33:34.880 --> 33:37.597
Oh...

33:37.599 --> 33:40.249
You two enjoy each
other's company.

33:40.251 --> 33:43.687
You'll have much
to bond over

33:43.689 --> 33:48.224
once the hallucinations
and dementia set in.

33:48.226 --> 33:50.360
Consider that bite

33:50.362 --> 33:53.530
my parting gift
to you both.

34:10.592 --> 34:12.627
Oh...

34:14.679 --> 34:16.597
That's it.

34:16.599 --> 34:18.933
You're free.

34:20.436 --> 34:22.887
Uh...

34:25.074 --> 34:29.527
You're right.
I can feel it.

34:29.529 --> 34:31.362
Before, I was
always thinking

34:31.364 --> 34:33.281
about what Klaus
would want me to do.

34:33.283 --> 34:38.235
Now I'm like ,
"screw that guy."

34:38.237 --> 34:40.603
Ha! Ha ha ha!

34:40.606 --> 34:44.625
Klaus Mikaelson
can suck it. Ha!

34:49.098 --> 34:53.668
What? What's
that look for?

34:53.670 --> 34:57.839
Marcel wants me to make you
forget about me.

34:57.841 --> 35:01.476
Oh, well, you don't
have to do that.

35:01.478 --> 35:04.762
I owe you my life.

35:06.298 --> 35:08.933
I'll keep
your secret.

35:11.303 --> 35:14.989
Besides,
it's kind of nice

35:14.991 --> 35:17.942
just talking to someone
normal again.

35:17.944 --> 35:20.411
You think I'm normal?

35:20.413 --> 35:23.031
I'm a 16-year-old witch
living in a church attic

35:23.033 --> 35:26.134
like some kind
of freak.

35:26.136 --> 35:27.985
I'm a gay club kid
who died

35:27.987 --> 35:29.754
and came back
as a vampire.

35:29.756 --> 35:32.507
Ha ha!
Yeah.

35:32.509 --> 35:36.794
Normal is kind of
relative, you know?

35:36.796 --> 35:39.881
Here.
Pinky swear on it.

35:46.438 --> 35:49.507
You don't
have to help.

35:49.509 --> 35:51.692
I can dig through the
werewolf antique show

35:51.694 --> 35:54.362
on my own.

35:54.364 --> 35:56.364
Besides, shouldn't
you put some kind

35:56.366 --> 35:58.900
of ointment or
something on that?

35:58.902 --> 36:01.452
The bite
won't kill me.

36:01.454 --> 36:03.671
Like Niklaus himself,
it's more of a nuisance

36:03.673 --> 36:05.206
than anything,
really.

36:05.208 --> 36:07.075
Good, because
I'm eventually

36:07.077 --> 36:10.211
gonna need
a ride home...

36:12.431 --> 36:14.365
And thanks,
by the way,

36:14.367 --> 36:15.883
for staying
out here.

36:15.885 --> 36:17.135
You didn't have to.

36:17.137 --> 36:22.039
I know,
but you said

36:22.041 --> 36:23.724
the people
of this village

36:23.726 --> 36:26.394
are all of the family
you have left.

36:26.396 --> 36:29.981
I can relate.

36:32.384 --> 36:35.553
You're thinking
about Klaus.

36:35.555 --> 36:40.408
Perhaps I was too willing
to condemn him.

36:40.410 --> 36:42.743
In the 1,000 years
that we have been together,

36:42.745 --> 36:46.297
my brother has committed
numerous unspeakable acts,

36:46.299 --> 36:48.366
but, then again,
so has Rebekah.

36:48.368 --> 36:49.784
So have I.

36:49.786 --> 36:52.136
So did I the last
time I was in Cabo.

36:52.138 --> 36:54.255
We all do bad things.

36:54.257 --> 36:55.840
It's just,
most people die

36:55.842 --> 36:59.127
before the list
gets embarrassing,

36:59.129 --> 37:01.429
but don't
for a second

37:01.431 --> 37:05.216
compare yourself
to Klaus.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.024
Heh.

37:13.026 --> 37:16.527
It's like a freaking
hotbox in here.

37:16.529 --> 37:18.946
I'm gonna
get some air.

37:39.501 --> 37:42.003
Someone
left this here.

37:42.005 --> 37:44.639
What is it?

37:44.641 --> 37:47.175
A Bible with
a family tree

37:47.177 --> 37:51.229
that goes back
generations.

37:51.231 --> 37:55.850
What are these names?
Who is Andrea?

38:00.739 --> 38:04.475
I think I am.

38:04.477 --> 38:07.078
That's the day
that I was born.

38:18.257 --> 38:22.093
I thought you
were leaving us.

38:22.095 --> 38:23.594
We both know
this family

38:23.596 --> 38:25.479
can barely function
without me.

38:25.481 --> 38:27.682
Where are Elijah
and Hayley?

38:27.684 --> 38:31.102
I left them
in the bayou.

38:31.104 --> 38:32.887
Why?

38:32.889 --> 38:36.224
Elijah and I had
a bit of a row.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.526
Ha ha ha!

38:38.528 --> 38:42.179
Hayley has conspired
to turn him against me,

38:42.181 --> 38:44.031
and you know our brother
never was one

38:44.033 --> 38:46.284
to resist
a pretty face.

38:46.286 --> 38:51.522
So one thing led to
another, and I bit him,

38:51.524 --> 38:53.874
left them both
stranded in the swamp.

38:53.876 --> 38:56.277
Daggering, biting,
deserting.

38:56.279 --> 38:57.712
Does your wickedness
ever end?

38:57.714 --> 39:01.048
My wickedness
is self-preservation,

39:01.050 --> 39:02.883
and I wouldn't have
to go to such lengths

39:02.885 --> 39:04.635
were I not beset
on all sides

39:04.637 --> 39:08.306
by incompetence
and treachery.

39:08.308 --> 39:11.309
Now that Elijah
has abandoned me,

39:11.311 --> 39:15.263
I'll be needing you
in my plot against Marcel.

39:17.733 --> 39:21.235
Don't expect to be
leaving town any time soon.

39:21.237 --> 39:22.270
Why should
I help you

39:22.272 --> 39:25.106
after what you
did to Elijah?

39:31.446 --> 39:34.665
You're my family.

39:34.667 --> 39:38.235
Besides, who better
to spy on Marcel

39:38.237 --> 39:42.340
than the girl he
so clearly loves?

39:42.342 --> 39:45.626
You can tell me
all his secrets,

39:45.628 --> 39:50.931
like how did he
find us here, huh?

39:50.933 --> 39:54.485
Any idea about that,
little sister?

39:56.805 --> 39:58.639
How should I know
why Marcel

39:58.641 --> 40:00.524
does what he does?

40:00.526 --> 40:04.312
You think I don't know
about your engineered run-ins

40:04.314 --> 40:05.929
all over the quarter?

40:05.931 --> 40:09.967
I know you've had
private chats with him.

40:09.969 --> 40:15.656
So just tell me what secrets
he's confided to you.

40:15.658 --> 40:18.959
Is he plotting
against me?

40:25.133 --> 40:30.004
My poor brother,
so paranoid.

40:30.006 --> 40:33.057
Marcel
knows nothing.

40:33.059 --> 40:35.059
He is not plotting
against you.

40:35.061 --> 40:36.627
He simply thinks
you're in a quarrel,

40:36.629 --> 40:38.646
in need
of making up.

40:43.268 --> 40:46.970
Perhaps we will.

40:46.972 --> 40:50.991
After all, you know I'm
capable of forgiving

40:50.993 --> 40:54.578
those who disappoint me
soon as they've seen

40:54.580 --> 41:00.534
the errof their ways
and suffered for them.

41:00.536 --> 41:03.921
You'd do well
to remember that.

41:07.158 --> 41:10.010
You never
let me forget.

41:19.020 --> 41:20.888
You want to make
a deal with me,

41:20.890 --> 41:22.440
you got to offer me
something.

41:22.442 --> 41:25.192
I already know about
Hayley the werewolf girl.

41:25.194 --> 41:28.396
What else you got?

41:28.398 --> 41:30.898
What if I told you
that werewolf girl

41:30.900 --> 41:33.234
is carrying
Klaus' child...

41:35.737 --> 41:38.706
And if that baby
is born,

41:38.708 --> 41:41.909
it'll mean the end
of the vampire species?
