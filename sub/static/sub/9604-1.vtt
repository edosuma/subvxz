02:50.783 --> 02:53.250
Fight! Fight! Fight!

03:45.517 --> 03:47.717
Before we begin...

03:47.917 --> 03:51.917
Settle down. I got a question
I want to ask you all.

03:52.117 --> 03:55.650
How many people came here
to change the world?

03:58.517 --> 04:02.650
How many people came here
to learn how to make a lot of money?

04:02.850 --> 04:07.850
Hey, we got an outreach program here
where we really tap into the community.

04:08.183 --> 04:09.383
What's the point?

04:10.317 --> 04:16.583
Hey, listen, my friends. You are
the few, the proud, the next...

04:16.783 --> 04:20.382
...incoming freshman class
to Columbus University.

04:20.583 --> 04:23.383
...unyielding pursuit
of academic excellence...

04:23.583 --> 04:26.850
...one university stands
out amongst the rest:

04:27.117 --> 04:30.383
Columbus University.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.917
- What's up, Malik?
- What's up, dog?

06:24.183 --> 06:29.450
- Your mama got you some school gear.
- Your mama let me use her credit card.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.983
- Yeah, all right.
- We'll see you.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.917
Malik, what's wrong with you?

06:36.117 --> 06:37.850
What?

06:38.583 --> 06:39.850
This.

06:40.050 --> 06:43.383
Why you always trying to showboat?
How come you're not dressed?

06:43.517 --> 06:45.850
My stomach was giving me trouble.

06:46.050 --> 06:49.783
You think because you're a superstar
rookie you don't have to work?

06:50.050 --> 06:54.717
I got guys on this field who'll clean
your clock in five seconds.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.050
Who?

07:01.450 --> 07:02.850
Get off my field.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.517
It's like that?

07:06.717 --> 07:09.250
That's how you made it.

07:15.517 --> 07:16.717
Dig.

07:17.583 --> 07:18.850
Dig.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.583
Little off today, baby, huh?

07:51.383 --> 07:54.317
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:54.650 --> 07:58.050
- I'm Kristen.
- Monet.

07:59.183 --> 08:01.250
We're roommates, huh?

08:01.450 --> 08:08.183
Yep. I like this side of the room,
but I guess you got here first.

08:10.517 --> 08:12.717
Yeah, I guess I did.

08:19.783 --> 08:22.583
So, where are you from?

08:24.117 --> 08:26.517
- Orange County.
- Orange County, huh?

08:26.717 --> 08:30.250
- Is that near Compton?
- No.

08:30.917 --> 08:34.250
- You're not from around here, are you?
- No.

08:34.850 --> 08:37.783
It's near Disneyland.

08:38.049 --> 08:41.049
You live near Disneyland?

08:42.383 --> 08:47.117
- Must be nice.
- It has its moments.

08:50.183 --> 08:51.850
Yeah!

08:52.117 --> 08:55.650
Go!

09:00.583 --> 09:03.383
This is crazy.

09:07.850 --> 09:10.850
Come on, girls, let's go.

09:11.783 --> 09:14.783
I am getting my own
apartment next semester.

09:14.850 --> 09:18.650
These dorms are f or children.
I hate them. God.

09:18.850 --> 09:25.517
- Do you want to room with me?
- Hell, yeah. My room's like this big.

09:25.783 --> 09:28.650
What about you?
Want to get an apartment together?

09:28.850 --> 09:33.183
- I can't afford it.
- No sweat. Get your parents to pay.

09:33.783 --> 09:35.450
- They can't.
- Why not?

09:35.783 --> 09:39.317
My dad got laid off
from McDonnell Douglas last year.

09:39.517 --> 09:44.250
The IRS audited him. My parents
could barely afford to send me here.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.383
- But you are here.
- I'm here and I'm happy.

09:47.450 --> 09:51.117
My roommate's a Mexican,
I bet she got a scholarship.

09:51.317 --> 09:55.650
Shut up. Well, here we are.

10:01.583 --> 10:05.250
All right, come here, darling.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.917
Drink! Drink! Drink!

10:15.583 --> 10:20.117
- Theta Kappa!
- Hey, Chad.

10:20.250 --> 10:25.050
Well, well, what do we got here?
New recruits f or our Little Sister rush?

10:25.250 --> 10:29.517
No, no. Actually, I don't
know about that.

10:29.717 --> 10:31.650
- Ladies, this is Chad.
- Hi, Chad.

10:31.917 --> 10:35.917
- Hey.
- And this is Nicole, okay?

10:36.117 --> 10:38.850
And this is Claudia, right?

10:39.117 --> 10:41.583
- And this is, uh...
- Kristen.

10:41.783 --> 10:46.050
Kristen. I'm sorry. They're freshmen.

10:47.517 --> 10:49.183
How do we become Little Sisters?

10:49.383 --> 10:54.117
They probably make you drink beer
out of condoms and wet your T-shirt.

10:54.317 --> 10:58.183
Beer out of a condom...
That's a new one. Write that down.

10:58.317 --> 11:01.383
- I will.
- No, we don't do that here.

11:02.050 --> 11:07.917
But I'll tell you this. There's nobody
on this campus who parties like we do!

11:08.783 --> 11:11.450
Yo!

11:36.650 --> 11:39.717
Man, governments
ain't running things no more.

11:39.917 --> 11:44.450
Financial institutions,
they controlling the whole thing.

11:44.583 --> 11:48.450
You ever hear of the World Bank
or the IMF? No, huh?

11:48.517 --> 11:51.117
Y'all probably don't even have
checking accounts.

11:51.317 --> 11:54.383
But y'all got them
credit cards, huh?

11:54.850 --> 11:58.650
Buy stuff out your means
and wonder why you still a slave.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.317
Y'all better recognize,
I'm telling you.

12:01.517 --> 12:05.183
Dude, when are you gonna clear
everyone out? Classes start tomorrow.

12:09.850 --> 12:14.583
- It's over when it's over, dude.
- "Dude."

12:39.650 --> 12:42.917
I can't take this no more.

12:46.183 --> 12:51.050
- Yo, man, watch my shoes.
- You got a problem, man?

12:55.650 --> 12:57.317
Security.

12:57.850 --> 12:59.717
Security.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.383
Look at this.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.650
- What's up, kid?
- They're playing their music, man.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.450
Who?

13:09.583 --> 13:14.050
These guys. I'm not trying to narc,
but tomorrow's the first day of class.

13:14.383 --> 13:19.317
I got physics in the morning.
It's like friggin' Soul Train up there.

13:21.183 --> 13:25.850
You're here to study, not to party.
Head home and hit those books.

13:26.050 --> 13:29.983
Glad you had a good time.
Come again on the weekend.

13:30.183 --> 13:31.983
Good night. Okay.

13:32.183 --> 13:36.250
People are trying to sleep.
Give them a little respect, huh?

13:36.450 --> 13:38.783
You don't hear that down the hall?

13:38.983 --> 13:42.583
You ain't sweating them because they're
playing that hillbilly shit, right?

13:42.850 --> 13:45.717
No, no. Because I dig rock 'n' roll.

13:46.050 --> 13:49.783
Then roll your f at ass
down the hall then.

13:50.050 --> 13:51.650
That's that old bullshit.

13:59.983 --> 14:01.917
Hey!

14:07.050 --> 14:10.917
- Why are you walking alone?
- I don't know.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.250
It's not safe to walk around
campus by yourself at night.

14:15.450 --> 14:19.583
I just left the Row 'cause my friends
were drinking and acting crazy.

14:19.850 --> 14:22.850
I just went my own way.

14:23.317 --> 14:25.317
Some friends.

14:25.517 --> 14:27.583
Yeah.

14:33.383 --> 14:36.117
Look at all these pretty blue lights.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.117
You don't know what
they're f or, do you?

14:40.250 --> 14:43.583
No. Decoration?

14:44.983 --> 14:47.383
No, it's the blue-light system.

14:47.650 --> 14:51.583
See, there's a phone
at the end of every block.

14:52.450 --> 14:57.250
That way you can call security
in case someone tries to grab you.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.850
You're gonna have
to be careful out here.

15:05.517 --> 15:07.650
Come on.

15:07.783 --> 15:10.650
I just got here.
Have you met anybody yet?

15:10.850 --> 15:13.917
Yeah, I just met somebody.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.983
My name's Taryn.

15:16.183 --> 15:19.850
- Junior.
- Kristen. Freshman.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.117
Fresh-woman?

15:22.583 --> 15:25.250
Yeah, I could tell.

15:25.783 --> 15:29.383
Well, my first class is at 8:00.

15:29.517 --> 15:31.117
- So...
- Where's your dorm?

15:31.383 --> 15:34.583
It's right here. Holland Hall.
Real close.

15:34.783 --> 15:38.050
- Thanks.
- Sure. Oh, wait.

15:38.317 --> 15:39.917
Here.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.250
Students f or a Non-Sexist Society.

15:43.450 --> 15:46.317
We have meetings Wednesdays
if you want to come by.

15:46.583 --> 15:49.050
Okay. Thanks.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.650
Oh, man.

16:15.250 --> 16:20.450
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were here.

16:22.783 --> 16:25.583
- It's time for us to talk.
- About what?

16:25.783 --> 16:28.983
About your side of the room.

16:29.783 --> 16:32.250
What's wrong with it?

16:32.650 --> 16:36.917
Look at it, man. It's filthy,
it's funky, it's stinking, man.

16:37.050 --> 16:41.650
- What you do on that side affects me.
- All right, I'll try.

16:47.983 --> 16:50.583
Let's take a trip around the world.

16:50.850 --> 16:55.450
Look there, under the statue.
You see them people?

16:55.650 --> 16:58.517
That's Disneyland.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.250
And there's Chinatown.

17:01.383 --> 17:05.050
And over there,
that's south of the border.

17:05.250 --> 17:10.782
And this right here is the black hole
because we're black folks.

17:10.983 --> 17:14.517
So, you Fudge, huh?
I heard about you.

17:15.317 --> 17:19.782
- What'd you hear about me?
- I heard you were a super-duper senior.

17:20.050 --> 17:23.517
Been here six years
and still haven't graduated.

17:23.717 --> 17:27.117
- She trying to play you out.
- Why is that?

17:28.983 --> 17:32.450
Because I done already
learned the game, fresh fish.

17:32.850 --> 17:36.917
Is that right, old trout?

17:38.650 --> 17:40.983
Yo.

17:41.517 --> 17:44.650
Y'all some trained Negroes.

17:44.850 --> 17:47.983
Soon as you hear a bell,
y'all go running.

17:57.583 --> 18:00.383
Welcome to the real world.

18:00.583 --> 18:05.450
Or, as it states in your schedule
of courses, Political Science 101.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.717
I am your instructor.
My name is Professor Maurice Phipps.

18:12.050 --> 18:17.783
Today I am going to give you your first
lesson in politics. Are you ready?

18:19.650 --> 18:23.450
Now, I shall need one volunteer.

18:24.183 --> 18:26.117
Anyone?

18:32.717 --> 18:37.250
No wonder this nation is falling
behind the rest of the world.

18:37.583 --> 18:41.117
No one in this class
seems to have any initiative.

18:44.183 --> 18:47.783
You, brave soul, come forward.

19:01.050 --> 19:07.650
- And what is your name, my good man?
- Malik Williams, Professor Phipps, sir.

19:08.183 --> 19:12.450
Malik Williams. Mr. Williams,
would you be kind enough...

19:12.717 --> 19:16.917
...to read the names
with the asterisks beside them?

19:17.050 --> 19:21.383
Those persons whose names
are called, please stand.

19:21.583 --> 19:27.117
All right. " Marvin Anthony,
Wendy Arrington, Tanya Arroyo...

19:27.317 --> 19:31.650
...Chris Barlow, Skye Blue,
Jennifer Bryant...

19:31.850 --> 19:38.250
Pamela Burris, Eric Cannon,
Kristen Connor, Judith Dantzig...

19:38.450 --> 19:41.183
...Patsy Ewing, Mark Katz...

19:43.317 --> 19:46.050
...Malik Williams." What?

19:47.050 --> 19:49.717
Thank you, Mr. Williams.
You have served your purpose.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.583
What's that list f or, dog?

19:52.983 --> 19:57.183
Those persons whose names were
called and whom are standing...

19:57.250 --> 20:03.317
...the university instructed me that
your financial bill hasn't been paid.

20:03.383 --> 20:08.450
Leave and settle your debts. You
may not return until you have done so.

20:08.717 --> 20:12.450
There are no handouts
in the free world...

20:12.717 --> 20:18.850
...and, appropriately, none in
my course. Thank you and good day.

20:23.183 --> 20:24.450
Shit.

20:25.717 --> 20:31.117
Professor Phipps, I need this class
f or my major. You know?

20:31.383 --> 20:37.917
Young lady, calm yourself and go
to the financial aid office.

20:39.317 --> 20:41.117
Go.

20:44.650 --> 20:45.850
What about me?

20:46.183 --> 20:48.717
Don't you have
some business to attend to?

20:49.250 --> 20:52.183
Yeah, but I thought
I just showed initiative.

20:52.383 --> 20:56.317
That don't count f or nothing, brother?

20:57.050 --> 21:00.650
Mr. Williams, I do not appreciate,
nor will I tolerate...

21:00.783 --> 21:04.917
...people who try to brown nose
in my course.

21:05.117 --> 21:11.650
Now go to the financial aid office
or appeal to the athletic department.

21:12.183 --> 21:15.050
I ain't no dumb athlete.

21:19.317 --> 21:22.383
That remains to be seen.

21:29.383 --> 21:33.517
Right. I hope that all of you...

21:33.783 --> 21:39.050
Yo, dog, take good notes.
I'm gonna need to borrow them.

21:40.583 --> 21:44.650
Now that the bureaucratic nonsense
is out of the way, we'll get to...

21:44.917 --> 21:47.117
...the business of real politics.

21:47.383 --> 21:50.783
Are you sure? I mean,
I don't understand this.

21:51.117 --> 21:54.317
Never leave home without it.

22:02.983 --> 22:06.250
Looks like we got a problem
with your fee bill.

22:06.383 --> 22:07.450
Like what?

22:07.650 --> 22:12.717
It says you got a partial athletic
scholarship. Better talk to your coach.

22:12.917 --> 22:17.250
Partial? That's a mistake.
I'm a full-scholarship student.

22:17.517 --> 22:20.183
I can't help that.
That's what it shows.

22:20.317 --> 22:25.783
- You sure your computer ain't broke?
- I'm sorry, honey. I can't help you.

22:26.050 --> 22:29.517
- Go get it cleared in that department.
- Thank you.

22:30.050 --> 22:31.917
Next.

22:35.117 --> 22:38.450
Baby, you're just gonna have
to get a job.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.183
Here's your card.

22:45.850 --> 22:48.717
Come on, guys, pick it up!

22:48.850 --> 22:53.183
You look like a bunch of girls!
Come on, pick it up!

22:53.383 --> 22:56.583
Come on, give me some juice.
There you go.

23:10.783 --> 23:14.183
Yeah, looking sweet.

23:49.050 --> 23:53.517
- Twenty-three!
- You want a what? A full scholarship?

23:55.183 --> 23:57.517
Man, you got some nerve.

23:57.983 --> 24:00.850
All right, I'll see what I can do.

24:01.050 --> 24:06.850
I don't wanna hear you're lax in your
studies or fucking up on the field.

24:06.917 --> 24:10.050
You got that?
Do I make myself clear?

24:10.183 --> 24:12.050
Yeah, man, I understand.

24:26.583 --> 24:30.917
Word to the mother, kid.
Have you seen that ass?

24:36.517 --> 24:40.650
Hey, yo, what kind
of munchies y'all got?

24:40.850 --> 24:44.450
Where are the vittles at? The eats?

24:46.450 --> 24:52.850
Hey, y'all ain't got no Kool-Aid
up in this piece, man? Guess not.

24:53.517 --> 24:57.517
I see y'all got some Evian
up in here, though, huh?

25:00.717 --> 25:07.383
How would you feel if you had to study
and I came in and blasted my music?

25:07.650 --> 25:10.583
- That wouldn't happen.
- Why not?

25:10.783 --> 25:14.383
Because I'd whoop your ass, that's why.

25:48.383 --> 25:50.583
Excuse me.

25:53.917 --> 25:57.583
Boy, I'm the master of Monopoly.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.183
That's right.

26:00.450 --> 26:02.650
You bankrupt, G.

26:02.850 --> 26:06.517
Should've bought them
apartments, man. I told you.

26:06.650 --> 26:10.783
Hey, why you going to this school?

26:10.917 --> 26:16.450
Well, because that's what they say you
need to do to make it in the country.

26:16.650 --> 26:21.250
- What's "making it"?
- Fudge, your printer's out of paper.

26:21.383 --> 26:26.583
Well, then go buy some more.
What's "making it"?

26:27.183 --> 26:31.383
You know, getting a degree.
You know, making that long dough.

26:31.583 --> 26:36.983
Is that right? So you in it
f or the money or the knowledge?

26:40.450 --> 26:42.650
Check out this situation.

26:42.850 --> 26:47.117
You at a football game.
There's thousands of people there.

26:47.317 --> 26:49.517
All of them white.

26:49.783 --> 26:52.717
The American flag
is right above your head.

26:52.850 --> 26:55.317
They're about to play
the national anthem.

26:55.517 --> 26:59.517
All these people turn around
and look you dead in your eye.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.983
What do you do?

27:04.117 --> 27:10.050
I stand up.
I'd probably be so embarrassed...

27:10.183 --> 27:13.717
You know, I'd stand up.
You know what I'm saying?

27:25.117 --> 27:27.917
They got you running
f or the school, huh?

27:28.183 --> 27:32.583
- Yeah. Partial scholarship.
- You don't run, you don't get tuition.

27:34.050 --> 27:37.383
That's the way the system goes.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.783
Run, nigger, run.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.250
Oh, my God. Look at her hair.

28:07.517 --> 28:12.183
- Be nice, Nicole. It's not that bad.
- She looks like a tramp.

28:12.383 --> 28:15.583
- Hi.
- Hi. What'd you do to your hair?

28:15.783 --> 28:19.717
- I just bleached it.
- I love it. Yes.

28:22.317 --> 28:25.050
Watch me bring it up.
Watch me bring it.

28:25.250 --> 28:31.383
Bam. Of all times.

28:34.050 --> 28:38.583
Want to play again, man?
Come on, let's play again.

28:41.050 --> 28:43.717
- Three in a row.
- You're a bastard.

28:54.383 --> 28:57.450
- Want to play?
- Huh?

28:57.650 --> 29:01.317
- Want to play a game of pool?
- I don't know how to play.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.450
Bye.

29:14.250 --> 29:18.050
Okay, who's the genius
who matches roommates up?

29:18.183 --> 29:20.250
They moved me in
with a psycho dickhead.

29:20.383 --> 29:24.183
It's like the Bates Hotel
over at my place.

29:24.317 --> 29:26.383
My days are numbered, Wayne.

29:26.583 --> 29:30.050
- He's probably just quiet.
- Okay.

29:30.250 --> 29:31.917
Hey.

29:32.983 --> 29:37.250
- Hey, man. Say, where's the party?
- Up here, man.

29:37.450 --> 29:40.383
Is that right? Cool.

29:47.850 --> 29:50.717
Here she goes.

29:50.850 --> 29:53.983
Nice job. Hello! Good night.

29:54.783 --> 29:56.183
Down the hatch.

29:56.583 --> 29:58.517
Talented, I see.

29:59.383 --> 30:03.050
- I never usually swallow.
- You're a dirty girl.

30:03.450 --> 30:07.050
- Hey, let's get one f or her, huh?
- Give her a shot.

30:08.717 --> 30:11.183
Kristen!

30:11.783 --> 30:14.650
Kristen! Kristen! Kristen!

30:16.450 --> 30:18.250
Drink! Drink! Drink!

30:24.250 --> 30:27.850
All right!
What a big girl you are, huh?

30:28.117 --> 30:30.450
- I can't walk.
- Please, come on.

30:30.583 --> 30:34.850
- All right. Where are we going?
- We're going to my house.

30:35.117 --> 30:36.983
To the house.

30:38.583 --> 30:44.450
When you say that you look really bad,
like, you're perfect, you know?

30:44.650 --> 30:48.650
Hey, do you think we should've
let Kristen go with Billy?

30:48.850 --> 30:54.183
- Because she doesn't even drink.
- Billy who?

30:54.983 --> 30:56.650
I love you!

31:18.183 --> 31:21.517
Billy, you've gotta get a rubber.

31:27.050 --> 31:30.250
Billy, we should be using a condom.

31:30.383 --> 31:31.650
Just a second.

31:36.517 --> 31:38.183
Billy, come on.

31:38.317 --> 31:41.117
- One second.
- No. Get a condom.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.717
Just wait a second.
Shut up!

31:42.917 --> 31:47.650
Billy, no! Stop it! Get a condom!

31:47.850 --> 31:50.850
No! Stop it!

31:51.050 --> 31:54.517
Billy, get off of me! Get off of me!

31:54.650 --> 31:56.983
- Fuck, man!
- No! Stop!

31:57.117 --> 32:00.450
Stop! No!

32:03.250 --> 32:04.983
You fucker!

32:05.183 --> 32:07.383
Kris, what the...? Wait!

32:07.650 --> 32:10.383
Wait a second! Goddamn it!

32:10.650 --> 32:12.050
Kristen.

32:13.117 --> 32:15.117
Kristen.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.650
Fuck!

32:48.850 --> 32:50.583
Say, man.

32:51.983 --> 32:55.117
- Did you give it to her?
- What?

32:55.183 --> 32:57.850
You fucked her, right?
Did she like it?

32:58.050 --> 33:02.250
What the fuck are you talking about?
How the fuck do you know?

33:02.383 --> 33:05.717
- Go get a beer.
- Who the fuck are you, man?

33:05.850 --> 33:08.917
You just got laid, right?
You should be cool.

33:09.117 --> 33:12.450
- Motherfucker!
- What's up with you?

33:14.850 --> 33:17.783
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem, bitch.

33:25.783 --> 33:30.317
I finished my paper
and I don't have anything to do.

33:30.383 --> 33:35.583
Kris, what's the matter?
Why are you crying?

33:36.317 --> 33:40.383
Oh, God, what have you been drinking?

33:40.517 --> 33:42.517
Kris, what's wrong?

33:50.050 --> 33:54.517
- Hello.
- Can I speak to Kristen, please?

33:54.650 --> 33:58.317
- Who's this?
- Billy.

33:58.450 --> 34:03.917
- Billy who? I don't know no Billys.
- Yeah, I just...

34:05.117 --> 34:06.517
I just need to talk to Kristen.

34:06.650 --> 34:10.317
- You want to speak to Kristen.
- No. No.

34:10.583 --> 34:13.050
She's not here.

34:13.250 --> 34:16.917
Even if she was here, I don't think
she'd wanna talk to you.

34:17.117 --> 34:19.917
I know she's there. I can hear her.

34:20.117 --> 34:24.183
- Can you put her on the phone?
- Didn't I just tell you she's not here?

34:24.317 --> 34:27.382
Put her on the phone,
you black bitch!

34:27.516 --> 34:31.516
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

34:56.449 --> 34:58.050
Why are y'all so quiet?

35:03.783 --> 35:07.983
- Let's go.
- To kick some ass, nigga?

35:14.050 --> 35:17.050
Just get away from him
and come home with me.

35:20.650 --> 35:24.250
What do you think they make
you do to get into this f rat?

35:24.450 --> 35:25.917
You know?

35:26.050 --> 35:27.850
You don't?

35:30.050 --> 35:33.050
I bet you they make you do something,
right?

35:33.583 --> 35:35.383
Like things.

35:36.717 --> 35:39.117
Crazy stuff.

35:40.650 --> 35:42.783
I'd do it.

36:01.383 --> 36:03.650
Which one?

36:10.117 --> 36:14.250
- Yo! Get the fuck up!
- Piece of crap. Get his ass.

36:14.383 --> 36:16.450
What's up, bro? What did I do?

36:19.250 --> 36:20.850
- Come on!
- Man, let me go!

36:20.917 --> 36:24.650
- Chad, what's up with these guys?
- Call security now!

36:28.983 --> 36:32.050
- What'd I do?
- I'll just put my boot in your mouth.

36:32.183 --> 36:33.717
I heard you been disrespecting
black women.

36:34.050 --> 36:35.717
No, man, I haven't either...

36:35.850 --> 36:39.583
You called me a black bitch,
and you gonna get your ass kicked.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.317
Come on, man, listen. I'm sorry.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.250
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Apologize to her!

36:44.317 --> 36:47.650
Sorry! I'm sorry! Look, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

36:47.783 --> 36:49.650
Fuck that!
We need to just bust his shit!

36:49.783 --> 36:54.517
- No, listen. Please, man.
- Here's what I want you to say.

36:54.717 --> 36:58.717
I want you to say,
"I apologize, beautiful black woman...

36:58.850 --> 37:01.517
...mother of the Earth,
queen of the universe."

37:01.650 --> 37:05.050
I'm sorry.
I apologize, black mother...

37:05.250 --> 37:08.783
- Get it right!
- I can't remember all that.

37:08.917 --> 37:10.850
I'm sorry.

37:16.450 --> 37:17.583
What's going on?

37:17.783 --> 37:21.517
These gang members
dragged him out f or no reason.

37:21.717 --> 37:24.917
What the fuck you talking about,
white boy?

37:25.117 --> 37:27.983
Gang members?
We go to school here too!

37:28.117 --> 37:32.250
- Enough of this stuff.
- I'll rip your ass off them stairs!

37:32.383 --> 37:35.983
Don't I know you? Everybody else,
come out with the I.D.'s.

37:36.183 --> 37:39.050
You don't need to see nobody I.D.
Don't show them.

37:39.183 --> 37:43.183
Wait. Everything's okay now.
It was just a misunderstanding.

37:43.383 --> 37:46.250
We're cool now, right?

37:47.917 --> 37:50.117
We're cool, right?

37:55.117 --> 37:59.383
Hope you gonna break up their party
like you did ours.

38:02.317 --> 38:05.450
- Is everything cool here now?
- Very fucking cool!

38:05.650 --> 38:06.850
What's up?

38:09.250 --> 38:10.317
Pussy.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.183
Punk-ass motherfucker.

38:30.183 --> 38:34.050
I don't understand why they always
have to start all this trouble.

38:37.583 --> 38:41.050
- You okay, Billy?
- Yeah.

38:46.983 --> 38:49.250
Come on.

38:50.250 --> 38:54.517
We need to get past just complaining
about university security.

38:54.650 --> 38:56.783
You know?

38:57.650 --> 39:02.583
I'm tired of hearing women cry
f or someone else to save them.

39:02.783 --> 39:04.917
Think what that means.

39:05.117 --> 39:07.783
Why do you need someone else
to save you?

39:07.917 --> 39:11.383
Think about saving yourself.

39:12.450 --> 39:16.317
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.850
Hi, everybody.

39:19.450 --> 39:23.050
- Join us.
- Okay.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.317
Hi.

39:26.183 --> 39:31.117
We were talking about security on
campus, in light of a recent survey...

39:31.317 --> 39:34.917
...that showed one out of f our women
has been raped...

39:35.183 --> 39:37.917
...or survived an attempted rape,
since the age of 14.

39:38.050 --> 39:44.117
Do you have any ideas or thoughts
you want to share?

39:51.583 --> 39:53.583
No.

39:59.983 --> 40:02.650
Fudge, you got some e-mail
coming through.

40:02.850 --> 40:03.917
Is that right?

40:05.117 --> 40:09.050
Need to start charging y'all fools,
like the university.

40:09.250 --> 40:12.117
Twenty-five cent a page.

40:12.850 --> 40:16.117
Y'all could pay f or my laundry.

40:41.583 --> 40:44.850
You got the autobiography
of Frederick Douglass?

40:44.983 --> 40:46.850
Yeah.

40:47.650 --> 40:49.717
Biographies are up there.

40:52.050 --> 40:57.183
- Damn. You read all these?
- Most of them.

40:57.383 --> 40:59.917
Hey, how you get turned on
to Douglass?

41:00.117 --> 41:02.517
Need it f or a class.

41:02.650 --> 41:06.450
For a class. That's the only
reason you're reading it?

41:06.650 --> 41:12.917
- Yeah. Why else?
- To feed your brain, fool.

41:13.050 --> 41:18.317
I thought you was a smart one,
but you ain't. So you got to go.

41:18.517 --> 41:21.517
- Can I borrow this book, man?
- Yeah, go ahead.

41:21.783 --> 41:25.517
Read it f or yourself
and not f or no damn class, though.

41:27.650 --> 41:30.650
- Thanks f or the book, dog.
- Run along.

41:42.783 --> 41:47.383
- What's up, brother?
- What's up, man?

41:47.517 --> 41:51.850
Reading in the dark
is bad f or the eyes.

41:51.917 --> 41:57.850
- I got good eyes.
- What book you reading?

41:59.517 --> 42:03.250
- Iliad.
- That's a good book. Great battles.

42:03.383 --> 42:04.983
Yeah, it's all right.

42:05.117 --> 42:08.917
Me and a couple friends,
we were gonna go get a drink.

42:09.117 --> 42:11.383
You wanna come along?

42:13.117 --> 42:18.317
I said, me and my buddies were gonna
go get a drink. You wanna come along?

42:19.250 --> 42:22.183
What are you,
some queer or something?

42:22.317 --> 42:27.117
- What? What are you talking about?
- I should kick your ass, man.

42:28.183 --> 42:31.383
First off, don't ever touch me again.

42:31.517 --> 42:35.650
I will beat you
to the fucking ground, boy.

42:36.250 --> 42:39.650
Secondly, you know,
I ain't no faggot.

42:39.717 --> 42:43.383
I just wanted to know
if you wanted to get a drink.

42:47.383 --> 42:53.783
- Sorry, man. It's a new city.
- That's okay. I understand.

42:53.850 --> 42:56.317
We'll forget about it,
have a drink...

42:56.517 --> 42:59.783
...with good people.
We'll have a good time.

42:59.983 --> 43:02.050
- What do you say?
- All right, man.

43:02.250 --> 43:04.583
Pick up your stuff. Come on.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.517
I mean, we're white, in America,
what more do you need?

43:08.783 --> 43:12.317
We're white, in America, what more
do you need to have a good time?

43:12.450 --> 43:13.517
Right?

43:13.717 --> 43:15.383
All right, here we go.

43:15.450 --> 43:19.650
- What's your name again?
- Remy.

43:19.850 --> 43:23.383
- What's your name?
- I'm Scott.

43:23.517 --> 43:27.250
- So, where you from, Remy?
- Idaho.

43:27.383 --> 43:31.983
- Idaho, huh? Where in Idaho?
- Boise.

43:32.183 --> 43:35.383
That's the Big Sky State, huh?

43:35.650 --> 43:40.317
- I think that's Montana.
- That's right. It is Montana.

43:40.917 --> 43:43.650
These are my brothers here.

43:43.917 --> 43:46.317
Fellas, hey.

43:47.917 --> 43:50.650
This here, this is Erik.

43:50.850 --> 43:53.850
- What's up, man?
- This is Knocko over here.

43:54.050 --> 43:56.050
- This is James here.
- Hi.

43:56.183 --> 44:00.450
- Everybody, this is Remy.
- Hey, Remy.

44:00.583 --> 44:01.850
What's up?

44:02.050 --> 44:05.450
You should know that democratic
theory did not begin...

44:05.717 --> 44:07.717
...with Rousseau's contract. No.

44:08.450 --> 44:12.850
Its origins, in f act, lie in
the subject of landownership.

44:13.050 --> 44:15.250
The common people became aware...

44:15.383 --> 44:19.850
...that the upper classes owned the land
upon which they lived and labored.

44:19.983 --> 44:22.583
This incensed them...

44:22.783 --> 44:27.383
...inspired them to seek sovereignty
of their own homelands.

44:27.517 --> 44:31.383
However,
the social order of the day...

44:31.517 --> 44:36.917
...did not permit landownership
by the common man.

44:37.783 --> 44:40.517
Therefore, these people...

44:40.717 --> 44:44.583
...felt the need to leave
their homelands...

44:44.717 --> 44:50.850
...to flee in an effort to escape
political and social persecution.

44:51.050 --> 44:55.317
Hence, the creation that is America.

44:55.450 --> 45:00.983
Therefore, the basic premise...

45:01.117 --> 45:03.517
...of democratic theory...

45:03.850 --> 45:10.250
...is that each and every citizen
living within that society...

45:10.383 --> 45:12.117
...is entitled...

45:13.383 --> 45:16.117
...to what?

45:18.250 --> 45:22.983
We are entitled to life...

45:24.650 --> 45:29.383
...liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.

45:34.183 --> 45:38.583
What you people have to realize
is that despite having these rights...

45:38.783 --> 45:41.583
...very few people exercise them.

45:41.783 --> 45:48.450
It is that type of apathy that
corrodes our country from within.

45:53.517 --> 45:58.250
Your assignment f or the semester
is as follows:

45:58.383 --> 46:03.983
To formulate
your own political ideology.

46:04.183 --> 46:09.450
This will be dictated by your sex,
background...

46:09.583 --> 46:12.050
...socioeconomic status...

46:12.183 --> 46:15.917
...personal experience,
et cetera, et cetera.

46:17.183 --> 46:19.517
This course will be like
anything in life.

46:19.650 --> 46:24.383
It will be what you make of it.
I am not a babysitter.

46:24.517 --> 46:29.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not waste my time.

46:29.383 --> 46:30.917
Remember...

46:32.650 --> 46:35.183
...no one is going to treat
you special...

46:35.383 --> 46:38.383
...just because you are black.

46:42.050 --> 46:45.383
Right. Or white.

46:46.383 --> 46:48.317
Or Hispanic.

46:50.250 --> 46:52.450
Or Indian.

46:53.517 --> 46:55.383
Or Asian.

46:56.317 --> 46:59.317
Or because you are a woman.

47:00.717 --> 47:06.383
Or because you f ailed to get
sufficient rest last night.

47:09.250 --> 47:11.250
Or because you are...

47:14.783 --> 47:16.783
What are you?

47:18.583 --> 47:21.717
- I don't know.
- Right.

47:27.117 --> 47:29.917
Don't sweat it.

47:30.050 --> 47:31.850
Come on.

47:32.650 --> 47:34.517
Watch it.

47:35.383 --> 47:37.717
- Watch out.
- Watch it. Watch it.

47:37.850 --> 47:40.783
- Damn.
- Let's see your I.D.

47:40.983 --> 47:44.183
No, let us see your I.D.

47:46.250 --> 47:48.850
Forget these guys.

47:50.050 --> 47:52.383
Thought so.

47:52.583 --> 47:57.183
You know what that's all about?
They hate me 'cause they ain't me.

48:09.517 --> 48:13.783
Can you hand me another one
of those mayonnaise?

48:23.650 --> 48:30.317
- Do you want to report it?
- It's not gonna do anything.

48:32.517 --> 48:35.783
They're just gonna make me
feel like shit...

48:35.917 --> 48:39.050
...and make me look like
I asked f or it.

48:41.117 --> 48:46.583
I didn't ask f or this.
I just wanna go to school.

48:50.117 --> 48:51.650
Come here.

48:58.583 --> 49:03.117
This ain't cool, dog. A " B" on
content, and then I get a " C" f or...

49:03.317 --> 49:07.983
Punctuation mistakes,
misspellings...

49:08.183 --> 49:12.983
...grammatical error,
et cetera, et cetera.

49:16.783 --> 49:21.317
You probably didn't even read it.
TA graded all of these, right?

49:21.517 --> 49:27.250
If you could spell as well as you run,
it would be better, Mr. Williams.

49:32.317 --> 49:35.983
- Sellout.
- Mr. Williams.

49:36.317 --> 49:42.917
So Mr. Williams
thinks I am an Uncle Tom.

49:45.050 --> 49:48.383
Well, well, well.

49:49.517 --> 49:54.383
What does that have to do with your
ability to place a comma properly...

49:54.583 --> 49:57.783
...or put a period
at the end of a sentence?

49:59.383 --> 50:01.250
- Look...
- Would you care f or a peppermint?

50:01.517 --> 50:03.183
No, thank you.

50:03.383 --> 50:06.317
You're using
that reverse treatment...

50:06.450 --> 50:10.850
...'cause I'm one of the only
black f aces in your class.

50:10.917 --> 50:15.383
Mr. Williams, I treat everyone
in my course exactly the same...

50:15.517 --> 50:19.317
...and I will continue to give you
a difficult time...

50:19.450 --> 50:23.183
...until you have proven
that you deserve otherwise.

50:23.383 --> 50:27.983
- Those are the rules of the game.
- It's a fucked-up game.

50:28.117 --> 50:30.317
Please watch your language.

50:30.517 --> 50:34.917
Rid yourself of this attitude
that the world owes you something.

50:35.050 --> 50:39.183
You must strip yourself of that
mentality. It breeds laziness.

50:42.050 --> 50:45.450
It is laziness that has kept
black people down in this country.

50:45.583 --> 50:50.250
I don't think like that.
All right, man, it's just...

50:50.383 --> 50:56.383
Look, I don't need one of my own
trying to treat me like I'm the enemy.

50:56.517 --> 50:59.117
The enemy? Who is the enemy?

50:59.250 --> 51:02.383
One man with a white beard
who sits behind his desk...

51:02.583 --> 51:06.050
...pushing buttons that control
the f ate of the entire world?

51:06.250 --> 51:10.050
No, that is not reality.
That is The Wizard of Oz.

51:10.317 --> 51:13.050
No, man, I mean anybody.

51:13.250 --> 51:17.450
White, black, anybody
who gets in the way of my progress.

51:18.583 --> 51:21.383
I am not in your way.

51:21.517 --> 51:24.583
I did not ask you
to come to this university...

51:24.783 --> 51:27.183
...nor am I here to motivate you.

51:27.383 --> 51:31.383
Your own presence
should be motivation enough.

51:31.583 --> 51:34.650
I have nothing to prove,
unlike you.

51:34.850 --> 51:37.717
I don't have anything to prove.

51:37.917 --> 51:41.117
Who do I have something to prove to?

51:43.183 --> 51:44.783
Yourself.

51:48.317 --> 51:50.250
Good afternoon, Mr. Williams.

52:06.583 --> 52:09.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next race on the track...

52:09.450 --> 52:13.183
...will be the 4x100-meter relay.

52:13.383 --> 52:19.250
In lane three, the non-scoring B-team
from John Paul College.

52:22.250 --> 52:28.050
Lane number four, the scoring team
from Columbus University.

52:28.250 --> 52:32.450
Lane number five, the scoring team
from John Paul College.

52:32.650 --> 52:37.250
And in lane six, the non-scoring
B-team from Columbus University.

52:37.383 --> 52:39.117
On your marks!

52:39.250 --> 52:41.583
May we have quiet for the start.

52:41.783 --> 52:43.050
Set!

52:57.650 --> 52:59.183
We have a fair start.

53:00.517 --> 53:05.250
Adam Bailey out very well
in lane four for Columbus University.

53:05.383 --> 53:08.983
Getting ready now for
the first exchange.

53:10.317 --> 53:11.383
Stick!

53:11.650 --> 53:18.317
Down the backstretch they go.
Columbus in four, John Paul in five.

53:18.450 --> 53:22.183
A tremendous effort
by John Paul College...

53:22.317 --> 53:27.250
...moves them into the lead as we
get ready for the second exchange.

53:28.317 --> 53:33.450
In the far turn, John Paul in five,
Columbus in four, neck and neck.

53:37.250 --> 53:39.717
Getting ready
for the anchor lea.

53:39.917 --> 53:41.183
Stick! Stick!

53:41.317 --> 53:44.250
Tyrene Jay for John Paul...

53:44.450 --> 53:47.717
...and Robert "The Rocket" Simmons
for Columbus.

53:50.050 --> 53:55.117
- It is John Paul followed by Columbus.
- First place, 39.58.

53:55.250 --> 53:57.717
Second place, 39.60.

53:57.850 --> 54:00.717
- Second place, 39.60.
- Correct.

54:00.917 --> 54:05.250
The next race on the track
will be the 1500 meters.

54:05.383 --> 54:10.050
That event is scheduled in 10 minutes.
Visit the concession stand...

54:10.117 --> 54:13.183
Ain't no next time.
All I'm saying is this.

54:13.250 --> 54:18.250
I got a lot riding on this. I'm not
about to let my stats get blown.

54:18.383 --> 54:21.383
You the only weak link on this team.

54:23.117 --> 54:25.783
You listening to me?

54:25.983 --> 54:31.183
Fool, all you is, all you ever gonna
be, is a runner. Like a horse.

54:31.383 --> 54:34.117
You're a slave,
too ignorant to know it.

54:34.317 --> 54:36.983
- Who you calling ignorant, bitch?
- Hey!

54:37.117 --> 54:39.450
- We're a team, man!
- Fuck that shit!

54:39.517 --> 54:42.183
We gotta stick together, black men!

54:42.317 --> 54:47.117
Get your shit together, bitch!
Stupid bitch!

54:47.317 --> 54:49.317
I like that.

54:49.517 --> 54:53.383
I like your beautiful hair,
your eyes, your lips.

54:53.517 --> 54:59.383
Look at this fool with his cave bitch.
It's a damn shame, man.

54:59.517 --> 55:03.450
Don't that make you upset
as a black woman?

55:04.317 --> 55:07.117
I don't want him.

55:07.250 --> 55:10.183
Yeah, I can dig that.
He's weak anyway.

55:10.317 --> 55:14.383
Miss Deja.
Where you from? Texas, right?

55:14.583 --> 55:19.383
- I see you did your research.
- Not enough.

55:20.517 --> 55:25.183
- God.
- I could always know more.

55:35.850 --> 55:37.250
What, you shy?

55:37.517 --> 55:40.317
- No. Are you?
- I stepped to you, didn't I?

55:40.517 --> 55:44.117
I've been seeing you on the track,
having a little attitude.

55:44.317 --> 55:47.317
I seen you too,
acting like you all that.

55:47.450 --> 55:50.317
- I'm not acting like...
- Mr. Big Stuff. Yes, you do.

55:50.450 --> 55:52.983
You be like:

55:53.117 --> 55:56.783
- Running f or your life.
- So you be looking at me?

55:56.917 --> 56:00.317
- I don't look at you.
- You just imitated my form.

56:00.450 --> 56:03.517
You be looking at me, right?

56:03.650 --> 56:08.650
A little bit,
but we're on the same team.

56:11.317 --> 56:16.183
- I been looking at you too.
- God.

56:17.317 --> 56:21.450
- What dorm you staying in?
- Why you wanna know where I live?

56:21.517 --> 56:24.917
- I wanted to get you home safe.
- I'll be okay.

56:25.117 --> 56:27.983
- There's a lot of crazies here.
- Goodness.

56:28.183 --> 56:31.117
I'll guard your body.
Be your bodyguard.

56:33.650 --> 56:38.783
How do you feel knowing this country
doesn't belong to you any longer?

56:39.250 --> 56:41.850
I mean,
what do you think of that?

56:43.383 --> 56:48.983
How do you feel knowing that
when you graduate from college...

56:49.183 --> 56:52.983
...you might not get a job because
of your skin color?

56:53.117 --> 56:54.850
Because of some quota.

56:54.983 --> 56:59.383
People don't realize how far down
the drain America has gone.

56:59.583 --> 57:02.383
What do you think about that, Remy?

57:05.783 --> 57:09.117
I guess I never thought
about that, man.

57:09.850 --> 57:14.383
It's different here than I thought
it was gonna be.

57:16.983 --> 57:19.983
Seems like everybody's
sticking to their own...

57:20.183 --> 57:22.783
...taking up f or their own.

57:24.783 --> 57:28.317
I don't know anybody down here.

57:30.783 --> 57:34.450
It's different, man. You know.

57:34.583 --> 57:38.183
- All I got is me.
- No, man.

57:38.917 --> 57:43.250
And me. We're brothers by blood.

57:43.450 --> 57:46.517
Yeah, you got me too, Remy.

57:49.250 --> 57:51.117
I think I'm gonna cry.

57:51.317 --> 57:55.317
Shut the fuck up, Knocko.
Show the man some respect.

57:55.517 --> 57:56.917
That's cool, Scott.

57:57.117 --> 58:00.450
That's pure Aryan blood
you're talking to.

58:00.583 --> 58:02.917
No, no, no, you're right.

58:03.983 --> 58:07.850
This is brotherhood, Remy.
Welcome home.

58:07.983 --> 58:11.450
- Thanks.
- See, Remy, this is your family now.

58:11.650 --> 58:16.517
And if there should be anything at all
that you wanna talk about...

58:16.717 --> 58:19.583
...then I want you to come to me
or to us.

58:19.917 --> 58:23.650
If there's one thing I want you
to leave thinking about tonight...

58:23.850 --> 58:26.850
...it's that we take care of our own.

58:29.850 --> 58:32.183
Thanks, man.

58:35.917 --> 58:37.650
Thanks, Scott.

58:39.583 --> 58:45.250
Run-on. Run-on.
Fragment. Fragment. Fragment.

58:45.383 --> 58:49.783
- Is this a period or a comma?
- That's a lot of red ink.

58:49.917 --> 58:52.250
- Do you want help?
- I'm here.

58:54.850 --> 59:00.983
Malik, you gotta get this to flow,
and right now it's not flowing.

59:01.317 --> 59:04.250
Right here,
that's a really good point...

59:04.450 --> 59:08.450
...but you gotta follow it up
with a concise explanation.

59:08.650 --> 59:09.850
What do you mean?

59:12.983 --> 59:17.517
Malik, when you write an essay,
you gotta follow a certain format.

59:17.583 --> 59:20.450
You start with your thesis statement...

59:20.650 --> 59:24.383
...and you have to always use
transitional phrases.

59:24.717 --> 59:28.117
And don't use the same word
every single time.

59:28.183 --> 59:30.917
Change it up.
Professors hate that.

59:31.117 --> 59:35.050
You should use a thesaurus.
And where's your outline?

59:43.050 --> 59:44.983
We got a lot of work to do.

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:07.650
- Is something wrong?
- No.

01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:09.517
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:00:11.517 --> 01:00:13.383
I'm fine.

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.783
I am afraid it is unclear.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:30.850
But... I don't understand.

01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:36.783
Miss Connor, you don't appear to take
any kind of position in this paper.

01:00:36.917 --> 01:00:42.850
I thought that, when you write, you're
supposed to be as objective as possible.

01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:45.450
That is a rule of journalism.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:48.583
It is often taught
and very rarely practiced.

01:00:48.783 --> 01:00:52.183
This, however,
is a political science course.

01:00:52.317 --> 01:00:54.650
If you wish to write
about objectivity...

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:59.383
...write about its use in modern
politics in your view.

01:01:01.183 --> 01:01:04.317
That'd make a good paper.
I'll write that down.

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:07.383
Oh, Christ Jesus.

01:01:08.717 --> 01:01:10.583
What?

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:14.583
In future, Miss Connor,
please find your own thesis.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:20.050
I am looking f or evidence
of original thought.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:24.983
You are not here to simply recycle
dates and f acts from the past.

01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:28.183
One's primary purpose
at university level...

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:31.717
...should be to learn how to think.

01:01:34.517 --> 01:01:38.583
Now, question:

01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:43.117
Did you write this paper?

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:48.117
You really feel like insulting
my intelligence, don't you?

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:52.650
I worked my ass off on that paper.
I rewrote it three times.

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:59.250
- Shouldn't be one misspelled word.
- Okay, Mr. Williams, I believe you.

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:06.050
Are you having problems
here at Columbus?

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:10.850
It's all right.

01:02:11.317 --> 01:02:16.583
I got a problem with the way fools
be tripping when they see a black f ace.

01:02:16.783 --> 01:02:21.450
Someone spit in your f ace
when you first came to campus?

01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:24.317
Was there a cross burned
outside your dormitory?

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:27.250
No. I know what you're
trying to get at.

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:31.517
Just 'cause it ain't up in my f ace,
that don't mean it's not happening.

01:02:31.717 --> 01:02:34.050
It's less physical now.
It's more mental.

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:37.317
I gotta run and study, man.

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:43.117
I don't see these white folks worrying
about nothing but going to class...

01:02:43.317 --> 01:02:47.183
...talking about skiing.
They don't have the same worries.

01:02:47.383 --> 01:02:53.583
Then your problem is financial.
Not racial, but economic.

01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:58.050
These type of problems
can be worked out.

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:03.150
For example,
you are a runner, are you not?

01:03:03.283 --> 01:03:06.750
- One of the best.
- A big-time track star, huh?

01:03:08.283 --> 01:03:09.750
All right.

01:03:10.017 --> 01:03:12.817
Let us say you are running a race...

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:18.217
...and you suspect the opposing team
has a member who is f aster, stronger...

01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:21.150
...more big-time than yourself.

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:24.483
What do you do then?
Do you leave the track?

01:03:24.617 --> 01:03:26.350
Hell, no.

01:03:29.083 --> 01:03:33.017
- What do you do?
- Run f aster.

01:05:03.883 --> 01:05:06.417
- We're having a rally.
- Out here?

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:09.483
Yeah, and we also have
these meetings as well...

01:05:09.683 --> 01:05:14.617
...where a group of women get together
and discuss all sorts of issues...

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.483
- ...about sexuality...
- Oh, wow.

01:05:17.683 --> 01:05:20.617
...student security,
all sorts of things.

01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:24.550
- I think it'd be great if you'd come.
- Thank you.

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:31.750
- What?
- I said, can I have a flyer?

01:05:31.883 --> 01:05:36.483
It's f or Students
f or a Non-Sexist Society.

01:05:36.617 --> 01:05:38.283
- Wayne, right?
- Yeah.

01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:43.283
- It's a women's group.
- That's kind of a contradiction.

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:45.817
You want a non-sexist society...

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:50.817
...but you won't give me a flyer
because I'm a man? That's not cool.

01:05:51.017 --> 01:05:53.150
Why do you really want to come?

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:55.550
- Your hair looks better that way.
- Thanks.

01:05:55.883 --> 01:05:58.417
- You're welcome.
- God.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:45.150
Warrior representation. Yes.

01:06:46.283 --> 01:06:50.350
No means no! No means no!
No means no!

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:27.150
I'm a freshman.

01:07:29.683 --> 01:07:31.817
And...

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:38.017
I was raped.

01:07:39.017 --> 01:07:40.350
No, we didn't.

01:07:40.483 --> 01:07:42.483
We'll have to think about
what we're doing next week.

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:45.483
- You look cute.
- Do I?

01:07:58.683 --> 01:08:00.750
Happy Halloween, brother!

01:08:00.883 --> 01:08:05.750
Be sure and stay away from the white
girls from now on. I know you will.

01:08:15.683 --> 01:08:19.883
What are you doing?
Let's go get some fucking candy!

01:08:20.082 --> 01:08:23.082
- That was awesome.
- It was good.

01:08:23.216 --> 01:08:26.417
There are things
we could've done better...

01:08:26.617 --> 01:08:30.082
...but I was proud of you.

01:08:30.216 --> 01:08:32.617
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:08:33.483 --> 01:08:36.950
- I feel so much better now.
- Good.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:40.350
Look, you know, I could just...

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.617
Why don't I just stay
with you tonight?

01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:50.483
We could stay up and talk or...

01:08:50.683 --> 01:08:53.149
What do you think?

01:08:53.883 --> 01:08:56.683
Are you sure you're ready f or that?

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:05.350
Don't do it just because
you're fascinated.

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:11.082
I want you to be sure.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.216
Good night.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:18.483
Good night.

01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:28.082
So...

01:09:28.216 --> 01:09:31.149
...what's up with your friend?

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:35.617
- She's weird.
- She's not weird. She's just different.

01:09:35.883 --> 01:09:41.683
Yeah, and I bet she wants to show you
just how different she can be, huh?

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:44.617
I'm tired of running and studying.

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:48.283
It's too hard to do both.
I feel like a slave.

01:09:48.483 --> 01:09:52.750
They wouldn't give a fuck about me
if I wasn't running f or this school.

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:56.750
I'm tired of feeling
like a thoroughbred.

01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:59.817
Why you always gotta
take stuff so far?

01:10:00.083 --> 01:10:04.217
People would die to be where you are,
and you tripping.

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:10.083
You have the opportunity to go
to school, and it's here. So take it.

01:10:10.217 --> 01:10:14.883
I don't see security stopping you
on campus to see your I.D.

01:10:15.017 --> 01:10:17.750
You're all hunky-dory
with your scholarship.

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:20.883
They'll let that harmless black woman
through easier than a man.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:23.817
- So you think I got it easy?
- Hell, yeah.

01:10:24.017 --> 01:10:27.883
- Easier than me.
- You know them girls I stay with?

01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:33.017
Every time something comes up missing,
who you think they look at?

01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:35.883
- And?
- I feel like fighting.

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:39.017
- I feel like beating people up.
- Why don't you?

01:10:39.217 --> 01:10:43.817
It's a waste of time.
Instead, I fight with this:

01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:45.883
And I'm getting mine.

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:51.750
You gotta stop doing this all the time:
And start doing this:

01:10:52.417 --> 01:10:55.417
Quit worrying about
what people are thinking.

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:58.150
Yeah, but it still ain't the same.

01:10:58.683 --> 01:11:00.083
Listen.

01:11:03.017 --> 01:11:06.750
You a woman.
I'm a black man.

01:11:08.017 --> 01:11:10.217
You're safe.

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:14.083
I'm a threat, educated or not.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.817
You ain't educated yet.

01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:18.683
Crazy!

01:12:46.883 --> 01:12:49.150
Hey. Kristen.

01:12:59.283 --> 01:13:03.283
- Can we talk?
- Sure. Here?

01:13:10.817 --> 01:13:14.283
- Don't put too much lipstick on.
- Why not?

01:13:14.483 --> 01:13:19.083
You don't want to look like a tramp.
You'll look desperate.

01:13:19.283 --> 01:13:22.417
Here, blot it some.

01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:30.750
- Is that better?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, like that.

01:13:31.017 --> 01:13:34.217
Is that him?
Well, all right, Kristen.

01:13:35.017 --> 01:13:38.883
I was getting worried about you.

01:13:44.617 --> 01:13:49.283
- Where'd you get these, man?
- A buddy of mine in law enforcement.

01:13:49.417 --> 01:13:52.550
Fucking gun-control department.

01:13:54.683 --> 01:13:56.150
These guns all suck.

01:13:56.550 --> 01:14:00.350
It don't matter as long as
they do the job.

01:14:00.883 --> 01:14:04.350
- Do you want a beer?
- Yeah.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.817
Check this out, man.

01:14:11.017 --> 01:14:13.017
This is a gun, man.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:17.950
- Glock 9 mm.
- Shut up.

01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:21.817
Pumped gas two years
to buy this. Laser sighting.

01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:26.550
Fucking Rambo, man!
No way I can miss.

01:14:27.683 --> 01:14:31.483
- This is power.
- Don't point that fucking shit at me!

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:35.950
I know how to handle guns, man.
I been shooting since I was 9.

01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:40.217
Don't ever point a gun at me
ever again. You'll be sorry.

01:14:40.617 --> 01:14:43.083
Who taught you how to shoot?

01:14:43.217 --> 01:14:46.550
- My pa.
- Your pa?

01:14:46.817 --> 01:14:52.150
My pa's a survivalist.
Used to kick my ass every day.

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:56.350
He's always talking about
the world coming to an end.

01:14:57.483 --> 01:14:59.550
Do you like to hike?

01:14:59.817 --> 01:15:03.083
I've never really tried it.

01:15:03.217 --> 01:15:07.617
Yeah? You should go.
Around here there's beautiful hills.

01:15:07.817 --> 01:15:13.217
I try and go everyday. I was there
this morning. The light was beautiful.

01:15:13.417 --> 01:15:16.550
What if there's snakes?
Hey, Monet.

01:15:16.683 --> 01:15:17.817
Hey.

01:15:19.283 --> 01:15:23.083
- How's it going?
- Cool. You all right?

01:15:23.283 --> 01:15:25.483
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:15:25.617 --> 01:15:28.217
- Hi, Taryn.
- Hi, Monet. How you doing?

01:15:29.217 --> 01:15:35.017
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you guys later. Bye.

01:15:38.683 --> 01:15:40.617
Girl!

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:48.550
I like it that you understand me.

01:15:51.017 --> 01:15:53.750
There are things that...

01:15:55.883 --> 01:15:59.417
...I don't have to say because...

01:16:01.683 --> 01:16:04.683
...you just know how I feel.

01:16:44.883 --> 01:16:47.417
That was nice.

01:16:52.617 --> 01:16:55.083
I think you're nice.

01:17:18.017 --> 01:17:20.083
You're trembling.

01:17:20.483 --> 01:17:21.950
Are you afraid?

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:25.483
Yes.

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:33.950
Why?

01:17:36.017 --> 01:17:38.550
I won't hurt you.

01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:44.350
I don't want you to do anything
that you don't wanna do.

01:18:02.283 --> 01:18:04.483
I know.

01:18:13.617 --> 01:18:16.017
I want to.

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.350
Are you ready?

01:18:33.817 --> 01:18:35.817
Just a second.

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:55.583
As a black man in America,
my stress comes from everywhere.

01:18:55.783 --> 01:18:59.583
Recognize.
Take a look around you.

01:18:59.783 --> 01:19:03.183
Look at this.
Columbus disgusts me.

01:19:03.383 --> 01:19:06.983
Fool wasn't nothing but a thief,
mass murderer.

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:12.850
Slaughtered Native Americans, we got a
holiday and a university named f or him?

01:19:12.983 --> 01:19:15.917
We're supposed to be learning their
westernized thoughts...

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:19.517
...only to learn that in their eyes,
we're lower class. Always.

01:19:19.783 --> 01:19:21.450
Class is a state of mind.

01:19:21.983 --> 01:19:26.183
History's proven you can be
the smartest, run the fastest...

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:28.917
...they still think we inferior.

01:19:32.383 --> 01:19:34.450
What's that shirt, man?

01:19:34.583 --> 01:19:37.250
You support the Black Panthers?

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:41.517
- Yeah. And?
- That's reverse racism, man.

01:19:42.117 --> 01:19:43.850
1995, coon.

01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:45.983
- What?
- Malik, come on...

01:19:46.983 --> 01:19:48.450
- What?
- Stop.

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:52.383
I'm gonna kick your ass,
whatever ass you got left, fool!

01:19:53.317 --> 01:19:56.983
Yeah, all right.
You can run, but you can't hide!

01:19:57.117 --> 01:20:01.050
"The sharp separating wall
between master and slave fell.

01:20:01.183 --> 01:20:05.117
The Aryan gave up the purity of his
blood and, therefore, he also lost...

01:20:05.317 --> 01:20:08.850
...the place in the paradise
he had created for himself.

01:20:08.983 --> 01:20:13.917
He became submerged in the
race mixture. He gradually lost..."

01:20:31.383 --> 01:20:32.983
What's up, man?

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:44.050
Man, I gotta admit, you've been real
polite about staying out of my way.

01:20:44.850 --> 01:20:46.583
But you ain't been honest.

01:20:47.517 --> 01:20:53.783
I figure, it ain't what a person say,
it's what they think.

01:20:53.983 --> 01:20:55.850
So in my mind...

01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:59.517
...you been walking around calling me
a nigger in your head.

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:01.383
Am I right?

01:21:02.183 --> 01:21:05.517
- I don't have nothing to say to you.
- I think you do.

01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:09.917
Say what you feel.
You think I'm a nigger?

01:21:10.117 --> 01:21:13.183
Then be a man and call me one
to my f ace.

01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:29.250
You're just a punk-ass white boy
with a fucked-up haircut.

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:31.450
Bitch.

01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:43.117
Fuck!

01:21:53.517 --> 01:21:54.983
Fuck!

01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:11.917
Fuck you!
You don't fucking scare me!

01:23:36.517 --> 01:23:41.117
This is fucked-up.
This is really fucked-up.

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:44.583
What's wrong with you?

01:23:44.717 --> 01:23:48.117
I don't give a shit
what you do with your stuff...

01:23:48.317 --> 01:23:50.983
...but this is my stuff, man!

01:23:51.183 --> 01:23:54.250
- Know how selfish that is?
- What are you gonna do?

01:23:54.383 --> 01:23:58.717
Jeez, I don't know. I'm gonna
kick your ass. What does that mean?

01:23:58.983 --> 01:24:02.583
Why don't you get your shit
and move out, man?

01:24:02.717 --> 01:24:05.983
Excuse me?
Why don't I get my shit and move out?

01:24:06.183 --> 01:24:09.383
- You moved in here.
- What are you gonna do?

01:24:09.517 --> 01:24:11.783
Look, why don't we just sit down?

01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:15.583
Why don't we just fucking
stop this and talk about it?

01:24:15.783 --> 01:24:19.050
I don't wanna talk to you.
I don't need to talk.

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:21.117
Don't you know I'm superior to you?

01:24:21.383 --> 01:24:24.450
Don't you know I came
from the master race?

01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:29.450
- You're nothing. Don't tell me what...
- Get off, crazy motherfucker!

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.650
All right, motherfucker?
Go to sleep.

01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:37.583
Calm your ass down. Calm down.
What is wrong with you, man?

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:41.783
- What's going on?
- I gotta get out of here.

01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:43.383
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck?

01:24:43.517 --> 01:24:46.450
You damn Jews and niggers
stick together.

01:24:46.717 --> 01:24:49.917
You all work against me,
the pure, white, Christian man.

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:53.850
Don't you know he controls you, nigger?
You ain't nothing without them.

01:24:53.983 --> 01:24:56.517
You're nothing!
You're a slave.

01:24:56.650 --> 01:25:01.450
I'll take my fucking belt off, man.
I'll make you my fucking monkey.

01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:03.583
- Get on the floor.
- Relax.

01:25:03.783 --> 01:25:05.450
Get on the floor!

01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:08.783
You're not white.
You're Jewish. You're nothing.

01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:11.717
You're not me!
What are you gonna do?

01:25:11.783 --> 01:25:15.317
Dirty nigger.
Got something to say now?

01:25:15.517 --> 01:25:19.050
I'm not fooling.
You got something to say now?

01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:23.250
- Jesus Christ! Fucking relax!
- Who's the man now, big man?

01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:27.917
Fucking hotshot ape.
You're nothing, Malik! You're nothing!

01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:31.450
You're dead. You're dead.

01:25:41.383 --> 01:25:43.450
Don't move, fucker.

01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:51.983
You're all gonna die.
You're gonna die, monkey!

01:25:53.783 --> 01:25:57.850
He had a fucking gun!
A fucking gun!

01:25:57.983 --> 01:26:02.383
I'm gonna call secur... He broke the
phone. We gotta call security.

01:26:02.583 --> 01:26:05.650
- I'm gonna get this fool!
- Where are you going?

01:26:15.983 --> 01:26:18.783
- Stop. Not so fast.
- Get out of my way.

01:26:18.917 --> 01:26:22.250
I'm trying to catch this dude
who just pulled a gun on me!

01:26:22.383 --> 01:26:26.117
- Let's see I.D.
- You don't need no I.D.! Out of my way!

01:26:34.717 --> 01:26:38.717
No! That's the wrong guy!
That's the wrong guy!

01:26:38.917 --> 01:26:41.850
- Who are you?
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:26:50.117 --> 01:26:54.183
Charlie, look what I found
in the kid's room.

01:26:55.517 --> 01:26:58.983
You believe this?
Do me a favor, will you?

01:26:59.183 --> 01:27:03.783
See if you can find a name or a picture
or an I.D. in his room.

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:05.650
You bet.

01:27:09.383 --> 01:27:12.983
All right, let's break it up.
Everything is fine now.

01:27:13.183 --> 01:27:16.850
What do you mean, "Break it up"?
Look at those white folks there.

01:27:16.983 --> 01:27:19.050
You ain't telling them to go.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:24.050
White boy pull a gun out in his f ace
and you ask us to break it up?

01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:27.983
Y'all got some nerves.
Fuck you! We ain't going nowhere.

01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:32.517
If they can stand over there together,
we can stand here together.

01:27:32.717 --> 01:27:38.650
Now you go find the asshole
that pulled a gun on this man's f ace.

01:27:41.317 --> 01:27:45.450
Get those kids to move out
so we can clear this area.

01:27:45.583 --> 01:27:48.117
Okay, let's go.
Break it up. Come on.

01:27:48.383 --> 01:27:51.917
Show's over. Back to your rooms.
Nothing to see here.

01:27:52.117 --> 01:27:54.450
What do you think
happened here?

01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:58.117
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:01.317
It's Malik.

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:05.650
What happened?

01:28:05.783 --> 01:28:09.717
- He doesn't feel like talking now.
- Can I help?

01:28:11.383 --> 01:28:13.383
What's that all about?

01:28:16.517 --> 01:28:17.983
I don't know.

01:28:22.117 --> 01:28:25.183
Hey, man. Malik, wait up.

01:28:25.517 --> 01:28:29.650
What's up, man?
Why'd you move all your stuff out?

01:28:29.783 --> 01:28:32.050
I'm staying with some homies now.

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:36.050
I thought you and David
might want to live together.

01:28:36.317 --> 01:28:39.250
David doesn't even know
if he's going to school next semester.

01:28:39.383 --> 01:28:43.783
He's all depressed. His parents
have him going to a shrink.

01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:47.717
- I think he's lost it, myself.
- Listen, Wayne.

01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:50.183
I think you're cool, man.

01:28:50.383 --> 01:28:53.383
We ain't never had no beef,
outside of your dirty clothes...

01:28:53.517 --> 01:28:55.917
...and opposite taste in music.

01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:59.517
But I'm just...
I'm at the point where...

01:28:59.783 --> 01:29:03.250
...I feel safer and more comfortable
with my own people.

01:29:03.450 --> 01:29:07.650
I ain't come here to have
no white boy pull a gun in my f ace.

01:29:07.783 --> 01:29:09.983
I could have got that in the ghetto.

01:29:10.183 --> 01:29:14.983
Seems like this system is setup
towards maintaining white supremacy.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.050
I didn't come here to learn that...

01:29:17.183 --> 01:29:22.717
I understand you're pissed.
But I'm not like that, Malik.

01:29:24.383 --> 01:29:26.450
You treat me like I'm Remy.

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:29.650
I'm not like that.
I'm no white supremacist!

01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:31.517
Is that what you see?

01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:34.717
I'm different.

01:29:34.917 --> 01:29:38.317
So are you. You know?

01:29:44.183 --> 01:29:49.517
No, I'm not. Neither are you.
That's the problem.

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:51.783
Peace.

01:29:57.317 --> 01:30:01.583
What are you two doing
sitting there? Plotting?

01:30:03.783 --> 01:30:08.250
Yeah, we're plotting.
Plotting to steal.

01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:11.250
To steal what?

01:30:13.117 --> 01:30:19.850
- To steal the information. All of it.
- Yeah, but whose information is it?

01:30:20.517 --> 01:30:24.917
The more you learn about this system,
the more upset you get.

01:30:26.983 --> 01:30:30.850
Oh, my dear Mr. Williams.

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:34.317
Peppermint?

01:30:37.517 --> 01:30:40.317
Information is power.

01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:47.117
If you don't have the information,
one cannot seize power.

01:30:49.183 --> 01:30:53.250
You need to think about
becoming mentally competitive.

01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:57.050
Being black does not free you
from being a responsible individual.

01:30:57.117 --> 01:31:02.650
But being a responsible individual
don't free you from being black.

01:31:02.717 --> 01:31:06.050
- That's right.
- Poor, misguided soul.

01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:10.450
You have yet to learn
the rules of this game.

01:31:10.650 --> 01:31:13.517
- He will.
- I don't want to.

01:31:13.650 --> 01:31:17.450
See, I'm smart enough to know
it's not my game to play.

01:31:17.650 --> 01:31:19.250
I'm just a pawn like everybody else.

01:31:19.717 --> 01:31:24.117
Used intelligently, a pawn can create
a checkmate, Mr. Williams.

01:31:24.317 --> 01:31:28.183
Or become a very
powerful player himself.

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:34.183
Don't you understand?
This is all a game. All of this.

01:31:34.383 --> 01:31:39.917
Like basketball, football,
Mr. Big-Time Track Star, a game.

01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:41.717
You play it to win.

01:31:41.917 --> 01:31:48.050
Because in the real world, no one wants
to hear excuses or empty rhetoric.

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:50.783
They want to know
if you have a plan.

01:31:58.117 --> 01:31:59.983
Right.

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:05.050
Mr. Williams, Mr. White,
good afternoon.

01:32:05.183 --> 01:32:07.250
All right.

01:32:08.850 --> 01:32:10.983
Mr. White?

01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:17.250
- You had his class before?
- Yeah, I had his class once.

01:32:17.383 --> 01:32:19.583
Maybe twice.

01:32:21.183 --> 01:32:22.450
Let's roll.

01:32:22.583 --> 01:32:27.450
"Mr. Williams, do you have a plan?
Nobody wants to hear that bullshit."

01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:31.250
Somebody's got to do something
about how tense it is.

01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:36.450
We can't let the campus go crazy
because of the actions of some psycho.

01:32:36.583 --> 01:32:40.383
What do you mean, "we"?
"We" don't have to do anything.

01:32:40.583 --> 01:32:45.317
Just because you and I get along
doesn't mean everybody else has to.

01:32:45.450 --> 01:32:48.983
Get that "We Are the World"
stuff out of your head...

01:32:49.183 --> 01:32:52.650
...'cause it is not gonna happen,
not on this campus.

01:33:06.517 --> 01:33:10.117
Hi, here's a flyer f or the Peace Fest.
Take a flyer.

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:12.583
Come to the Peace Fest.

01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:16.050
- Faggot.
- Suck my ass.

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:18.450
- Fuck.
- Fuck you.

01:34:18.583 --> 01:34:22.117
- Fuck me? Why don't you shut up?
- Don't start that.

01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:25.250
Why did you drop out of school?

01:34:29.183 --> 01:34:32.117
I never really wanted
to go anyway, man.

01:34:32.317 --> 01:34:36.050
All's it was was an excuse
to get out of Idaho.

01:34:36.650 --> 01:34:38.450
You know?

01:34:39.583 --> 01:34:44.050
What's the point? The gooks and
towel heads get the engineering jobs.

01:34:44.383 --> 01:34:50.250
Leave the white man in the cold.
Goddamn affirmative action shit. Right?

01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:54.917
You really should not have dropped out
of school. You hear me?

01:34:55.250 --> 01:35:00.050
We need more people like you
to become doctors, lawyers, engineers.

01:35:00.317 --> 01:35:05.317
You listen, you get it together and
you do something f or your own people.

01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:06.783
Your own country.

01:35:06.983 --> 01:35:11.783
If you don't, you ain't nothing
but a race traitor yourself, you hear?

01:35:11.983 --> 01:35:12.850
Fuck you, you big-eared faggot!

01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:13.983
Fuck you, you big-eared faggot!

01:35:14.183 --> 01:35:18.517
No, you know what?
You are worse than a fucking nigger!

01:36:26.717 --> 01:36:28.717
- What's up?
- Is Malik here?

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:33.850
Yeah. You didn't bring no homies?
Got any sisters?

01:36:35.250 --> 01:36:37.650
- What's up?
- You got crazy friends.

01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.050
What happened?

01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:48.317
Skinhead fool who
pulled a gun on me...

01:36:48.583 --> 01:36:50.983
I beat him.
I'm the man. I'm God!

01:36:51.583 --> 01:36:53.450
Put something cold on it.

01:36:53.650 --> 01:36:56.983
- I don't need no ice.
- Put the ice on it!

01:36:59.517 --> 01:37:01.517
I had his ass like this:

01:37:06.583 --> 01:37:10.450
Why you fighting like some thug?
This is college.

01:37:10.517 --> 01:37:12.983
I don't know about that no more.

01:37:13.183 --> 01:37:16.650
About to take a semester off,
let the shit cool.

01:37:17.917 --> 01:37:23.183
It's about this, nigger! See this?
Yo, it's about this black fist, nigger!

01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:26.650
We gonna pound
their motherfucking ass...

01:37:26.717 --> 01:37:30.183
...until they give in, motherfucker!

01:37:30.317 --> 01:37:32.317
You're gonna drop out.

01:37:32.517 --> 01:37:35.517
- Did I say that?
- I see it in your eyes.

01:37:35.717 --> 01:37:38.917
I said I'm gonna take me a break.
Look at me!

01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:44.850
- Look what they did to my fucking f ace!
- What's wrong with you?

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:56.983
It's a war, man.
This is the first battle in the war.

01:37:57.183 --> 01:38:02.450
I'm telling you, man. Remy's right,
man. It's their gang against our gang.

01:38:03.517 --> 01:38:06.650
Fucking Malik.
I'm gonna get him. Fuck him!

01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:11.050
Fuck all those fucking niggers.
They're all gonna fucking die.

01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:16.450
Fucking Malik's a piece of shit.
It's all right. We're coming back, man.

01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:22.650
We're coming back. Niggers, spics,
the fucking mud people, they'll get it.

01:38:22.783 --> 01:38:25.917
- Fucking idiots.
- Fuck all those niggers, man!

01:38:29.050 --> 01:38:32.117
Hey, yo, trooper.
What's up, man?

01:38:32.383 --> 01:38:36.850
What's up with your girl?
She out there looking kinda bugged.

01:38:36.983 --> 01:38:40.850
It ain't nothing.
She's just tripping, I guess.

01:38:42.717 --> 01:38:44.717
It's all good, though.

01:38:46.717 --> 01:38:49.983
Them fools.
They so lucky they called security.

01:38:50.183 --> 01:38:54.783
I was fit to kill one of them white
boys. You know what I'm saying?

01:38:54.983 --> 01:38:58.983
Whoa, shit!
Fucking white boy.

01:38:59.117 --> 01:39:04.050
See how he swole my shit up?
Knuckles all fat and shit.

01:39:04.317 --> 01:39:07.650
It's all right, though.
Whipped his ass so bad...

01:39:07.783 --> 01:39:11.717
...his step mom's gonna feel me
f or the next three birthdays.

01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:14.650
Look what his homeboy did
to your head.

01:39:14.783 --> 01:39:19.583
What you talking about? This shit?
He ain't fading nothing over here.

01:39:19.783 --> 01:39:23.717
- One ass-whooping, but they still won.
- How you figure that?

01:39:25.383 --> 01:39:27.917
Look around you, man.

01:39:28.383 --> 01:39:30.383
They own this shit.

01:39:31.317 --> 01:39:36.050
They own this couch you sitting on,
them shoes on your feet...

01:39:36.183 --> 01:39:40.050
...this building, this school,
this country, you!

01:39:42.317 --> 01:39:44.983
We're behind enemy lines, dog.

01:39:45.983 --> 01:39:51.983
One beat-down will never compare
to 439 years of captivity. Never.

01:39:53.117 --> 01:39:56.450
You don't know shit, freshman.

01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:03.583
This is a war. This is the opening
stages of World War III.

01:40:03.783 --> 01:40:06.050
I said, shut the fuck up!

01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:13.983
I'm tired of hearing your bullshit. I'm
tired of you trying to rev everybody up.

01:40:14.183 --> 01:40:18.983
What are you gonna do, college boy?
And you don't even got your GED.

01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:22.717
- Two fucking dumb-asses together.
- I'm gonna make war.

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:25.450
That's right, man. A race war.

01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:27.917
- On who?
- On the fucking niggers.

01:40:28.117 --> 01:40:31.917
On the fucking race traitors.
On the fucking everybody.

01:40:32.517 --> 01:40:33.917
Why you testing me?

01:40:35.517 --> 01:40:38.717
Remy, you ever shot somebody before?

01:40:40.783 --> 01:40:45.250
Actually, better yet,
you ever shoot a piece of meat?

01:40:45.983 --> 01:40:48.983
Seen what bullets do to flesh?

01:40:50.917 --> 01:40:55.317
Them fucking niggers out there,
them fucking little monkeys...

01:40:55.517 --> 01:40:57.850
...those gang bangers...

01:40:58.650 --> 01:41:04.317
...are training every fucking day
and every night shooting each other.

01:41:10.317 --> 01:41:12.650
They're ready f or war.

01:41:12.917 --> 01:41:15.183
But are you?

01:41:16.650 --> 01:41:18.917
If it all went down today...

01:41:20.583 --> 01:41:24.117
...which one of you would have
the balls to shoot a nigger?

01:41:24.317 --> 01:41:26.183
- I would.
- You would?

01:41:27.183 --> 01:41:28.850
Would you?

01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:32.583
I have.

01:41:34.783 --> 01:41:37.183
- I'd do it.
- Yeah?

01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:39.783
That's right. I'd do it.

01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:42.317
All right, then.

01:41:44.183 --> 01:41:46.717
- What's his problem?
- My fucking head's killing me.

01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:49.517
Everybody says things one way,
and you talk to me that way?

01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:53.050
This is my blood, man.
It's white blood.

01:41:53.983 --> 01:41:56.717
What you got there, Scott?

01:42:08.583 --> 01:42:13.250
Go on and kill one of them, man.
Big shot.

01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:16.983
- Are you really gonna do it?
- Yeah, he's gonna!

01:42:17.117 --> 01:42:18.850
I'll do it.

01:42:19.450 --> 01:42:22.383
You do it.
You do this shit, Remy!

01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:25.983
Right between the nigger's
fucking eyes!

01:42:26.183 --> 01:42:28.983
- I'll do it, man.
- All right, Remy!

01:42:29.117 --> 01:42:32.050
Come here. Hey! Hey!

01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:39.050
There are many ways to fight a battle.
Different fronts f or different people.

01:42:39.183 --> 01:42:42.050
Some people use their mind,
some use words...

01:42:42.183 --> 01:42:44.583
- ...some use fists.
- This is my front.

01:42:44.783 --> 01:42:47.783
- For real?
- That's right. This is my front.

01:42:47.850 --> 01:42:50.850
- You're full of shit.
- I'm f or real.

01:42:54.717 --> 01:42:56.317
Go ahead, then.

01:42:58.183 --> 01:43:00.050
What is high?

01:43:00.583 --> 01:43:02.583
What is higher?

01:43:02.917 --> 01:43:05.117
What is learn?

01:43:05.383 --> 01:43:07.183
What is learning?

01:43:07.317 --> 01:43:10.583
What is higher learning?

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:13.783
What it is?
I mean, what is it?

01:43:14.117 --> 01:43:16.850
What is higher learning?

01:43:19.717 --> 01:43:22.317
Promise me you won't drop out.

01:43:23.717 --> 01:43:26.583
I ain't going nowhere without you.

01:43:31.783 --> 01:43:34.183
Vikina Two to Vikina One.

01:43:35.783 --> 01:43:38.183
- Yeah, Viking One.
- Let's do it, man.

01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:42.983
I'm gonna kill communication.
This looks suspicious. All right?

01:43:46.783 --> 01:43:48.983
For Eurocentric indoctrination...

01:43:49.117 --> 01:43:52.583
...is learning in an environment
that is mostly white.

01:43:53.583 --> 01:43:57.517
If the Dred Scott decision
was retried in a contemporary court...

01:43:57.783 --> 01:44:00.050
...the decision would be the same...

01:44:00.183 --> 01:44:03.583
...meaning that a black man
would still have no rights...

01:44:03.717 --> 01:44:06.583
...that a white man, by law,
would be bound to respect.

01:44:06.717 --> 01:44:09.383
The result would be the same
no matter what the law states...

01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:12.983
...because it was not written by and
for the benefit of African-Americans.

01:44:13.117 --> 01:44:15.183
The credo
"And liberty and justice for all"...

01:44:15.317 --> 01:44:20.383
...is a falsehood that has been widely
ignored and needs to be addressed.

01:45:43.050 --> 01:45:44.717
That was great.

01:45:44.850 --> 01:45:48.383
Let's give a big round of applause
f or Eve's Plum.

01:46:02.517 --> 01:46:06.117
The purpose of this gathering
is to bring together everyone...

01:46:06.317 --> 01:46:09.983
...so we can have f un
despite our differences...

01:46:10.183 --> 01:46:13.917
...whether they be racial,
cultural or sexual.

01:46:14.117 --> 01:46:18.450
This is a celebration of the
commonality of these differences.

01:46:18.583 --> 01:46:22.317
There are people in this country who
have profited from keeping us apart.

01:46:43.317 --> 01:46:45.583
Do you feel better?

01:46:45.717 --> 01:46:47.583
I'll feel better tonight.

01:46:48.383 --> 01:46:49.983
Shoot, Remy, shoot!

01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:54.717
Remy, brother,
you gotta do it now!

01:46:54.917 --> 01:46:57.650
Come on, Remy!
Do it for the Aryan Nation!

01:46:57.917 --> 01:47:00.983
White power, Remy!
White power!

01:47:01.317 --> 01:47:03.117
White power!

01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:22.650
- I know what that was. Come on.
- It was probably a car.

01:47:25.317 --> 01:47:26.717
Shit!

01:47:26.917 --> 01:47:29.383
Somebody's got a gun!

01:47:29.517 --> 01:47:32.983
Everybody, stay calm.
Don't panic.

01:47:57.253 --> 01:47:59.187
Come on!

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.920
Why?!

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.920
We have to get her to the hospital.

01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:35.987
Go get some help, boy!

01:49:37.587 --> 01:49:39.453
Mr. Williams?

01:49:39.987 --> 01:49:42.453
Mr. Williams, please...

01:49:45.987 --> 01:49:48.787
Malik, what are you
standing there f or?

01:49:49.653 --> 01:49:51.853
You must go now!

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.720
Do you hear me, Mr. Williams?

01:49:55.253 --> 01:49:57.253
Do you hear me?

01:51:01.453 --> 01:51:03.520
White motherfucker!

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.853
You're dead!

01:51:23.853 --> 01:51:26.653
It's my world. It's my country.

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.787
It's my world.

01:51:29.053 --> 01:51:31.720
You're nothing but a monkey.
Look at me.

01:51:31.987 --> 01:51:34.453
I'm a man. I'm the man.

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.320
I'm a man! You're nothing!

01:51:37.587 --> 01:51:41.187
- You're nothing! You can't beat me.
- Fuck you.

01:51:47.453 --> 01:51:49.453
I fucking hate you!

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.587
You gonna die!

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:53.253
She's dead!

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.520
I'm gonna kill you!

01:51:57.453 --> 01:51:59.920
You're gonna die now!

01:52:04.387 --> 01:52:06.720
- You all right?
- Get off me!

01:52:29.453 --> 01:52:31.920
Hey, kid. What are you doing, kid?

01:52:32.187 --> 01:52:33.920
Take it easy. Come on.

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:40.053
It's gonna be all right. Settle down.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:46.920
Everything's gonna be fine.
Take it easy. Just relax.

01:52:48.053 --> 01:52:49.920
What are you doing? No!

01:52:51.187 --> 01:52:53.320
- Don't shoot.
- Get away!

01:52:53.587 --> 01:52:55.720
- We can't get back, kid, we can't.
- You wanna shoot me.

01:52:55.987 --> 01:52:58.120
No, we don't. Put the gun down.

01:52:58.387 --> 01:53:01.720
- Get away from me.
- We're not coming any closer.

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.787
- You're lying.
- I'm not. Nobody's hurt yet.

01:53:05.053 --> 01:53:08.853
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying. Look at my eyes.

01:53:09.187 --> 01:53:10.720
Phoney.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.187
I'm sorry.

01:53:16.253 --> 01:53:18.053
I'm sorry.

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.720
It's okay. We know. Put it down.

01:53:23.987 --> 01:53:26.120
- It's over.
- No.

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.520
Don't do this. Put it down.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:32.253
I wanted to build things.
I wanted to be an engineer.

01:53:32.453 --> 01:53:34.987
- You still can.
- Stop lying!

01:53:35.253 --> 01:53:38.587
Please, put the gun down. It's okay.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:40.253
It hurts.

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.053
I know.

01:53:42.453 --> 01:53:45.853
- It hurts.
- I know, kid. It's okay.

01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:47.987
- It's okay.
- It's not.

01:53:48.253 --> 01:53:49.787
It is.

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.387
This is Columbus University,
a great center of higher learning.

01:55:55.587 --> 01:55:58.053
But the lesson taught here today...

01:55:58.253 --> 01:56:01.587
...was one in how good things
can go tragically wrong.

01:56:01.853 --> 01:56:06.987
A multicultural peace fest organized
in the interest of campus unity...

01:56:07.187 --> 01:56:09.587
...has ended with three people dead.

01:56:09.853 --> 01:56:15.587
One of them was a gunman who took his
own life after killing two students.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.787
The mayor...

01:56:16.987 --> 01:56:20.053
...is on his way to the campus
as we speak.

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:24.653
University administration
has had nothing whatsoever to say.

01:56:24.853 --> 01:56:27.120
Wow. You know what that is?

01:56:27.453 --> 01:56:29.587
Remy's fucking dead.

01:56:30.853 --> 01:56:34.320
No, man. That's white power.

01:56:36.053 --> 01:56:38.120
Yeah, you're right.

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:42.853
White power. White fucking power!

01:56:43.587 --> 01:56:46.653
- White power!
- Sieg heil.

01:57:19.253 --> 01:57:21.587
What do you think I should do?

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.320
What do I think?

01:57:32.187 --> 01:57:33.720
You're right.

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:36.053
That's my job.

01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:38.587
Man...

01:57:39.387 --> 01:57:41.920
Man, I don't know, you know?

01:57:42.187 --> 01:57:44.387
Maybe if I hadn't...

01:57:44.587 --> 01:57:46.320
It's just...

01:57:47.053 --> 01:57:49.787
Man, I don't know what to do.

01:57:54.387 --> 01:57:56.720
Mr. Williams...

01:57:56.987 --> 01:58:02.320
...in spite of the recent tragedy here,
you have persevered.

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:06.320
You have overcome many obstacles
this semester.

01:58:06.453 --> 01:58:11.520
For those reasons,
you have my utmost respect...

01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:14.120
...and every confidence...

01:58:14.453 --> 01:58:19.120
...that you will make a wise decision
concerning your future.

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:38.187
Got to think.

01:58:40.187 --> 01:58:42.787
Got to get my head straight.

01:58:44.653 --> 01:58:46.720
I'm gonna go now.

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.187
Without struggle,
there is no progress.

01:59:15.187 --> 01:59:17.120
Frederick Douglass.

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.320
Right.

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:22.853
I lost my girl here.

02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:36.787
I feel like this is all my fault.

02:00:37.453 --> 02:00:40.987
I helped put this whole thing together.

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:44.987
I'm responsible f or all of this.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:54.587
Oh, God.

02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:04.320
Hey.

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.520
You can't blame yourself, you know?

02:01:22.187 --> 02:01:24.587
My name's Kristen.

02:01:25.787 --> 02:01:27.720
Malik.

02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:32.320
Nice to meet you.

02:01:34.587 --> 02:01:36.920
I seen you around.

02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.587
Phipps' class, huh?

02:01:45.587 --> 02:01:48.120
It's funny we never spoke before.

02:01:54.453 --> 02:01:56.053
Yeah.

02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.920
It's funny.

02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:17.187
Well...

02:02:17.653 --> 02:02:19.587
...I gotta get going.

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:26.387
- Take care.
- You too.

02:03:11.987 --> 02:03:14.653
All right. Give us a big smile now.
