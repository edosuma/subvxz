I don't think anybody actually
had slutty wedding sex.

36:03.779 --> 36:06.714
Well, not yet.

36:06.782 --> 36:09.417
Right.
30 seconds of heaven.

36:09.484 --> 36:12.486
Ha ha. 45.

36:12.554 --> 36:14.087
[ chuckles ]

36:16.525 --> 36:19.860
Bourbon is a good,
honest drink.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.995
No, it's not.

36:22.063 --> 36:24.832
Saw you dancing
with brooke.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.467
Didn't you have a date?

36:26.535 --> 36:28.068
Yeah.

36:28.136 --> 36:29.537
She did, too, right?

36:31.306 --> 36:32.406
What happened to them?

36:43.318 --> 36:45.352
Oh, my god, you look
just like drew.

36:45.420 --> 36:49.189
And you totally
look like brooke.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.296
Brooke.

36:58.199 --> 36:59.934
Hi.

37:00.001 --> 37:03.337

[ laughs ]

37:13.081 --> 37:14.915
Of course you are.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.917
Would you ask brooke
to call me, please?

37:16.985 --> 37:19.019
You do realize
the name of the company

37:19.087 --> 37:22.990
Is clothes over bros, yes?

37:25.827 --> 37:29.930
My father always made me feel
like i wasn't good enough.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.499
Anytime i had any success,

37:31.566 --> 37:34.201
He would remind me
of my failures.

37:34.268 --> 37:35.803
I see that in brooke.

37:35.871 --> 37:39.607
She's so talented and
good-hearted and beautiful,

37:39.674 --> 37:41.108
But she carries around
this feeling

37:41.175 --> 37:43.443
That she's not
good enough.

37:43.512 --> 37:46.079
And she has you
to thank for that.

37:46.147 --> 37:47.815
Nice work.

37:47.883 --> 37:49.984
Are you finished?

37:50.051 --> 37:52.853
No. not yet.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.857
I love your daughter.

37:56.925 --> 37:58.526
I'm in love with her.

37:58.593 --> 38:01.595
And one of these days,
she's gonna love me back.

38:01.663 --> 38:03.797
And when she does, i want you
to understand something.

38:03.865 --> 38:06.901
You're either gonna learn
to be nice to her...

38:06.968 --> 38:09.003
Or you won't
be in her life.

38:13.408 --> 38:15.976
It was nice to meet you,
victoria.

38:16.044 --> 38:19.713

What? i didn't
