WEBVTT

00:09.377 --> 00:13.445
(Indistinct radio chatter)

00:14.749 --> 00:15.965
Where are we?

00:15.966 --> 00:17.182
Faa handed over radio control

00:17.184 --> 00:19.318
on November-zero-five-
Julia-papa-zulu.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.720
Privately operated jet
took off from New Orleans

00:21.722 --> 00:24.256
approximately 90 minutes ago,
bound for Washington-Reagan.

00:24.258 --> 00:28.060
Atc has reported no radio
contact for the last 37 minutes.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.762
Comms failure?
Radio works, captain.

00:29.764 --> 00:31.530
Either they don't want
to talk or can't.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.798
Keep trying.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.033
My eyes in the sky.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.300
Two hornets on the horizon.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.769
Should have visual
in less than five.

00:36.771 --> 00:38.737
Private jet is outside
restricted airspace,

00:38.739 --> 00:40.205
but not for long.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.407
Over Metro D.C. in less than 30.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.408
Captain:
Damn.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.642
Hell of a day to quit smoking.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.743
Didn't know you smoked, ma'am.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.445
I don't.
I just imagine it's true.

00:46.447 --> 00:49.248
Zero-five-j-p-z, this is
naval air station pax river.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.416
Come in. Over.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.517
Man: Pax river,
this is gator-one-one.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.584
I have visual on our bogey.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.090
Put me through to NORAD.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.259
It's gonna be all hands
on deck for this one.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.628
Female officer: November-zero-
five-Julia-papa-zulu.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.064
This is naval
air station pax river.

01:05.066 --> 01:09.201
<i> Naval aircraft on approach,</i>
<i> north-northeast. Over.</i>

01:09.203 --> 01:12.471
<i> Zero-five-j-p-z, this is</i>
<i> naval air station pax river.</i>

01:12.473 --> 01:14.273
<i> Please respond. Over.</i>

01:14.275 --> 01:17.076
¶ ¶

01:44.738 --> 01:46.205
so what happened?

01:46.207 --> 01:47.206
I don't know.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.474
Tony, come on.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.741
All bishop said
was MTAC in five.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.210
No, I'm not talking
about MTAC.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.744
I'm talking about what
happened over new year's.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.745
You and Zoe broke up?

01:53.747 --> 01:55.481
(Chuckles dryly)
You heard.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.748
Why didn't
you tell me?

01:56.750 --> 01:57.883
Well, the break-up
bug's going around.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.218
Didn't want you
to catch it.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.486
Hey, be careful--
you know what happens

02:00.488 --> 02:01.820
if bishop hears you
joking around like that.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.555
I jest to comfort.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.290
So the breakup,
you and Zoe, it was messy?

02:05.292 --> 02:06.825
No, we agreed it
wasn't working out,

02:06.827 --> 02:08.827
so we ended on
a good note.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.162
Amicable, very adult.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.296
Oh, no, no, no.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.298
See, you and Zoe keates
do not do "adult."

02:13.300 --> 02:14.566
You both have
tact issues--

02:14.568 --> 02:16.568
you verbally,
her physically.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.737
Is this because she tackled
you the first time you met?

02:18.739 --> 02:21.306
Hey, she thought I was
a hermit bomb-maker.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.574
(Sighs) Miss
that about her.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.842
(Scoffs) There you go,
more jokes.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.311
Must be pretty bad,
so you want to talk about it?

02:26.313 --> 02:28.313
Who's paying you for
the details, mcgossip?

02:28.315 --> 02:29.848
Well, Abby and i
do have a bet

02:29.850 --> 02:31.316
on who throws
the first punch.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.851
Hey, there were
no punches thrown.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.586
But it was
physical, right?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.321
We're about to go live.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.323
What are you guys
talking about?

02:38.325 --> 02:40.759
<i>Star wars.</i>
<i> Star wars.</i>

02:41.729 --> 02:43.395
Hmm.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.199
(Gibbs speaks indistinctly
over radio)

02:47.201 --> 02:49.702
Captain:
<i> Negative, agent Gibbs.</i>

02:49.703 --> 02:52.204
After multiple passes, there are
no signs of life on that plane.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.206
A rapid depressurization
is likely.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.843
Causes a lack of oxygen to the
brain and death by hypoxia.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.844
How many?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.279
Four bodies that we can count,

03:00.281 --> 03:01.613
including the pilot
and the copilot.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.415
Bishop: Jet's registered
to blye industries.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.284
Military tech developer.
McGee: Among other things.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.819
Blye industries was
started by jenner blye.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.555
He's a pioneer in tech design.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.557
Exosuits, robotic prosthetics.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.759
(Chuckles)
They make jet packs.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.561
Yes, and jet packs.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.229
Thank you.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.764
What's your
point, McGee?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.499
You cut your hair?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.234
I didn't need it anymore.

03:22.236 --> 03:25.370
I believe agent McGee's point
was that this is a PR nightmare.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.371
Captain bloom.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.639
Director.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.274
Does NCIS know
who's on that plane?

03:29.276 --> 03:32.211
Naval intelligence officer
commander Gil lively

03:32.213 --> 03:34.813
informed his co of the flight
at 0600 this morning,

03:34.815 --> 03:36.682
but that's all we know.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.950
Flight manifest
would have been filed

03:37.952 --> 03:39.685
at the airfield of departure.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.954
Special agent pride and his team
are following up in New Orleans.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.622
He'll be joining
the conversation.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.692
We've got even bigger problems
at cruising altitude.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.695
The flight plan shows that bird
took off with a full tank.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.697
Given headwinds
and weather conditions,

03:51.699 --> 03:54.466
it won't go down for
another 400 to 600 miles.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.801
Does that get it
to the ocean?

03:55.803 --> 03:58.403
No. Puts us over three
Metro areas in the meantime.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.405
Philadelphia,
New York and Boston.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.840
Bishop:
It's currently
over unpopulated

04:01.842 --> 04:03.542
Virginia countryside.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.810
I've spoken to NORAD.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.311
We are prepared
to take down the target.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.547
Air strike on a civilian plane.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.849
No better than it sounds,
and even harder to control.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.452
Yeah, media and falling
debris alike.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.920
Aircraft is is only
over wilderness

04:14.922 --> 04:16.805
for another ten minutes.

04:16.806 --> 04:18.689
Now, unless you have
a safer way to bring it down,

04:18.692 --> 04:19.791
I've got my orders.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.460
We'll find a way.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.795
Abby:<i> I already pulled</i>
<i> the flight manuals,</i>

04:23.797 --> 04:25.497
acquired the jet's
radio frequency,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.699
and I tapped into the
onboard navigation computer.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.969
And?
And remotely crashing
an airplane is difficult.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.504
It's impossible, actually.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.772
For good reason.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.973
Not to mention
my misgivings.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.708
About what,
crashing a plane?

04:36.710 --> 04:37.709
Crashing anything.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.578
Fast.
Six minutes left.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.712
Okay, it's not
new year's,

04:40.714 --> 04:42.447
so cool it with
the countdown, please.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.716
Hey, have you tried accessing
the mechanical functions,

04:44.718 --> 04:46.451
tricking the computer
into dumping its fuel?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.719
Can't access it
wirelessly.

04:47.721 --> 04:48.720
Navigation?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.455
I can't override
the autopilot.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.140
It's a closed system.

04:52.141 --> 04:53.824
Right, a plane only does
what it's told.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.560
Okay, then crash,
plane, crash.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.828
Well, unfortunately,
you're not the pilot,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.864
autopilot or GPS system.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.566
But I could be.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.868
You just said it was
a closed system.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.870
All aircraft get their
directional data

05:04.872 --> 05:06.872
via GPS satellite.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.607
Right, location,
speed, altitude.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.976
GPS tells the
plane where it is.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.444
So if we can't
hack the plane...

05:12.446 --> 05:13.879
We hack the satellite.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.347
We send false data
to the aircraft,

05:15.349 --> 05:16.815
we make it think
it's way off course.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.617
And the autopilot should
correct accordingly.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.719
Right.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.820
No, I just... I don't
want to know that.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.823
Flight took off
from lakefront airport.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.458
Lasalle and Brody are there now.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.592
Flight manifest,
agent pride.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.111
Coming through.

05:29.112 --> 05:30.629
Agent Gibbs, director Vance,
we're out of time.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.897
You gave us ten
minutes, captain.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.965
We've still got 40 seconds.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.435
My pilots are in position,
and my orders have not changed.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.403
(Alarm sounds)

05:38.405 --> 05:39.805
Captain?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.940
Altitude alert.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.910
Bloom: The plane thinks
it's too high,

05:44.912 --> 05:46.545
and it's started
a steep descent.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.013
It appears to be...

05:48.015 --> 05:49.481
Crashing itself.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.482
Vance:
Where?

05:50.484 --> 05:51.983
Given it's
current angle,

05:51.985 --> 05:56.355
a remote corner of the cj brown
state forest and reservoir.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.923
Nice job, gentlemen.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.057
It was a team effort.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.792
(Cell phone rings)

06:00.794 --> 06:02.828
Hey. Where'd you go?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.464
Need to talk privately.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.068
(Door opens)

06:10.070 --> 06:11.403
Alert all the wildlife.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.604
(Alarm sounds)

06:12.606 --> 06:13.939
Ground avoidance systems.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.540
Dwayne, what's going on?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.843
Flight manifest
just came through.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.944
Pilot:
Pax river, gator-one-two,

06:18.946 --> 06:20.078
we have visual
confirmation of impact.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.079
Hang on.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.814
(Crashing)

06:22.816 --> 06:25.617
Pax river, gator-one-two,
the aircraft has crash-landed.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.152
Repeat, aircraft is
on the ground.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.621
Pride: Gibbs, we...
We got a problem.

06:29.623 --> 06:33.892
Fifth name on the list:
Luca Sciuto.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.029
Abby's brother was
on that plane.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.085
Luca?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.820
I know you're
not dead, okay?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.822
So call me back.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.491
Abby...
Gibbs, this doesn't
make any sense.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.895
Luca is a chef, and he's
a really successful one.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.763
Recently hired
by jenner blye.
Yeah.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.765
The-the tech
billionaire. I know.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.200
It's, like,
Luca's dream job.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.202
But, you know, it's not
like he's cooking

07:17.204 --> 07:18.703
on, like, private jets.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.705
Luca never leaves Nola.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.207
He doesn't like to fly.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.676
Are you sure
about this?

07:26.613 --> 07:27.946
Luca...

07:29.183 --> 07:30.649
...he's my brother.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.484
Not the brother I just
found out I have,

07:32.486 --> 07:34.586
but the-the brother
that I grew up with.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.588
I talk to him
every day.

07:36.590 --> 07:40.659
If he was coming to D.C.,
he would have told me.

07:40.661 --> 07:44.763
I mean, unless he was
gonna try to surprise me.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.501
Stop putting
thoughts in my head.

07:49.503 --> 07:52.037
Luca and I, we don't get
to see each other

07:52.039 --> 07:54.940
in person that much,
you know,

07:54.942 --> 07:58.009
'cause we're both super
dedicated to our jobs.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.011
But if Luca were dead...

08:00.013 --> 08:04.049
I would feel
a disturbance in the force.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.884
You know, that's very
strong in my family.

08:05.886 --> 08:06.885
I know that.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.787
Do you?

08:08.789 --> 08:12.524
Lasalle, Brody,
Percy, pride,

08:12.526 --> 08:14.192
they're all following
up in Nola.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.864
Okay. Good.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.131
That's good,
'cause they're gonna...

08:20.133 --> 08:22.033
They're gonna
find him there.
Abby.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.902
You should come
to the crash site.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.704
No.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.641
'Cause...

08:29.643 --> 08:31.710
Luca is not there.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.917
(Camera shutter clicking)

08:38.919 --> 08:40.685
(Siren whoops)

08:40.687 --> 08:42.687
(Indistinct radio chatter)

08:42.689 --> 08:44.756
(Helicopter whirring)

08:46.760 --> 08:49.794
Ntsb said autopilot kept
the plane level on impact.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.997
If anybody aboard
had been alive,

08:51.999 --> 08:53.298
they actually could have
survived the crash.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.100
Ironic, tragic.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.669
Tony: Manifest?
McGee: Five souls aboard.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.672
Pilot, copilot, blye
industries senior vp,

09:00.674 --> 09:02.607
commander lively
and Luca Sciuto.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.608
Mmm.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.110
You guys ever met him?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.545
No. Gibbs has, though.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.712
This will be
our first time.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.714
Ntsb is still
securing the wreckage.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.082
Tony: No sense
going in yet, then.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.217
I think we have to
wait for Gibbs anyway.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.218
Gibbs:
No, you don't.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.687
No more excuses.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.755
Let's go.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.030
¶ ¶

09:35.842 --> 09:38.076
McGee:
Oxygen masks didn't deploy.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.644
That's odd.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.194
Must be our
blye industries senior vp.

10:02.669 --> 10:06.671
Hypoxia usually shows wrinkled
discoloration in the fingers,

10:06.673 --> 10:08.740
but no signs of it here.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.075
Yeah, or here.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.211
Commander.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.916
McGee:
<i> No outward signs of hypoxia.</i>

10:17.918 --> 10:21.286
Doesn't mean it didn't happen,
but you know ducky's mantra.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.255
"We won't know more
until autopsy."

10:27.361 --> 10:31.162
The commander's body makes four,
so maybe the manifest was wrong.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.633
Five.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.034
Come here, McGee.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.172
Tail caught fire
from the crash.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.743
Body's too damaged to I.D.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.018
Chef Luca.

11:02.262 --> 11:06.064
Well, we've prepped all
five bodies for autopsy.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.333
Abby is officially
stalling.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.902
Yes, well, I promised
i wouldn't start any autopsy

11:10.904 --> 11:14.773
until she's had a chance
to I.D. Her brother.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.841
I know you prefer to
wait until the autopsy

11:16.843 --> 11:19.310
to actually talk about
the bodies, doctor,

11:19.312 --> 11:22.047
but can we talk about
the bodies, doctor?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.582
No.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.116
I just couldn't help but notice
the absence of

11:25.118 --> 11:27.752
any cyanosis on any of
the fingers or any of the toes

11:27.754 --> 11:29.354
of any of the bodies.
Mr. Palmer.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.690
At least some sign of hypoxia.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.957
I mean, it's weird.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.392
We won't know
what it is until...

11:34.394 --> 11:37.328
Until we do the autopsy.
Right, right.
Yes.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.064
But if I didn't
know any better...

11:39.066 --> 11:41.232
(Laughs):
Well, clearly you don't.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.701
...i would say that these people

11:42.703 --> 11:44.235
did not die from
depressurization.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.905
Yeah, well, there's nothing
to be gained by guessing.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.140
Can we at least agree
that there appears to be

11:49.142 --> 11:50.442
a hint of a suggestion

11:50.444 --> 11:51.943
of foul play?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.712
(Elevator bell dings)

11:53.714 --> 11:55.080
Hey, guys.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.249
Sorry I'm late.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.285
I was, um,

12:00.287 --> 12:04.756
sketching my brother's
dental records

12:04.758 --> 12:06.458
for a proper I.D.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.761
You know your brother's
teeth from memory?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.329
We're super close.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.131
And I also wrote down

12:13.133 --> 12:15.433
his measurements and...

12:15.435 --> 12:17.936
A description of his birthmarks.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.170
Really?

12:19.172 --> 12:21.806
So I'm ready.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.324
That's enough.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.494
I understand, Abby,
that this is hard,

12:42.496 --> 12:45.196
but we need you
to take a good look.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.198
No.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.267
I don't have to.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.437
It's not him.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.439
The face is badly burned.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.540
I know.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.143
But that body has
attached earlobes,

12:58.145 --> 13:00.779
and Luca-- he's free, like me.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.014
She right, doctor?

13:03.984 --> 13:05.984
Yes.
I knew it.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.787
The Sciuto force
was right again.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.856
But if Luca's
not in this drawer, then...

13:11.858 --> 13:14.092
Where is he?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.231
Lasalle:<i> I would think</i>
<i> Luca was cooking meth</i>

13:20.233 --> 13:22.934
if he didn't have
every book ever written

13:22.936 --> 13:24.335
on molecular gastronomy.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.104
Sonja:
Found every photo

13:26.106 --> 13:27.939
he's ever taken with his sister.

13:29.876 --> 13:30.975
Why are they all on Halloween?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.011
Tony:
That's just how she dresses.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.312
Did you find anything on Luca?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.181
Lasalle: Closets are full,
nothing was packed.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.083
Either he's still in town
or skipped it fast.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.636
And he's still not
answering his cell.

13:41.637 --> 13:44.188
You know, Tony DiNozzo--
why does your name ring a bell?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.057
Kind of a legend
in the NCIS world.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.492
Oh, I don't know
anything about that.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.093
I transferred from atf.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.128
Atf?

13:50.130 --> 13:51.596
You ever work with Zoe keates?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.531
Yeah.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.834
Training exercises in Georgia.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.535
You two are dating.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.870
Ah. Well, that's over now.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.338
Oh.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.106
Well, I hope for your sake
she ended it,

14:02.108 --> 14:04.509
'cause that girl was mean
on the jujitsu mat.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.510
I'll miss that.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.378
Found the mother lode.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.897
What'd you get?

14:08.898 --> 14:10.415
Bag hidden behind a
false wall in the closet.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.416
Uh, hello.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.151
Flying blind. Narration, please.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.119
About ten grand
in cash, Tony.

14:15.121 --> 14:19.157
And two nine-millimeters,
fully loaded.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.126
A little, uh,
high-tech listening device.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.262
What's a chef doing with a bug?

14:24.264 --> 14:29.000
Seems like we got a
fly in the soup, Tony.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.170
McGee:
Got you. Okay, thank you.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.139
Boss, o.N.I. Says
commander lively was

14:35.141 --> 14:37.542
flying to D.C. to meet with
the secretary of defense.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.576
About what?

14:38.578 --> 14:39.894
Well, they either couldn't

14:39.895 --> 14:41.211
or wouldn't say,
but blye industries has

14:41.214 --> 14:43.181
no current business
with the U.S. military.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.282
Secdef's office?

14:44.283 --> 14:45.382
Yeah, they sent over
his schedule.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.517
Redacted everything

14:46.519 --> 14:48.119
except for the meeting
with lively.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.522
Gibbs: It wasn't
set until late last night.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.241
Short notice.

14:53.242 --> 14:54.959
But, uh, must have been
pretty important.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.327
Yeah, well,
someone thought so.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.162
Killing everyone on
that plane would insure

14:58.164 --> 15:00.164
that that meeting
would never happen.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.967
Find out
what the commander knew.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.168
Hey, Abbs. Go-bag?

15:04.170 --> 15:05.436
Yeah.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.405
Didn't you get my e-mail?
Luca's in trouble.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.207
He texted me.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.508
What? When?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.643
Abby: He must've
removed the battery,

15:11.645 --> 15:12.944
'cause I can't
trace it.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.445
I think he's on the run.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.381
"Conniption."
Abby: It's code

15:16.383 --> 15:18.049
for where to find him.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.151
Redbird bolt, north Carolina.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.519
What's in redbird bolt?

15:22.622 --> 15:25.657
The colossal fun amusement park.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.225
And, hopefully,

15:27.227 --> 15:28.993
Luca in one piece.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.096
Gibbs, please, can I go
rescue my brother?

15:32.098 --> 15:33.464
Yeah. Yeah, Abbs, go.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.434
DiNozzo drives, Abbs.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.379
(People screaming playfully)

15:51.651 --> 15:54.118
We drove overnight because
your brother is hiding here?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.453
Yeah. Thank goodness
they're open

15:55.455 --> 15:57.221
for the new year's Eve festival.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.723
Luca's text said
"conniption"?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.326
It's a reference to the
roller coaster from vacation.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.328
The movie?
No, the Sciuto
family vacation.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.996
He knew I'd get
the reference.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.297
Oh. Fond memories?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.399
Unspeakable horrors
of screaming and vomit,

16:08.401 --> 16:10.034
and that was just
the car ride.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.469
We swore we'd never
mention it again,

16:11.471 --> 16:12.704
so if he's here, it's bad.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.105
Okay, big park--
where do we start?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.273
At the conniption.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.041
We don't have to ride
that thing, do we?

16:17.043 --> 16:19.110
Yeah. It gives us
the best view of the park.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.679
Now I know why
McGee didn't come.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.549
(Buzzing, beeping)

16:26.486 --> 16:28.219
Oh, screw you.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.155
Are you kidding? Come on!

16:31.157 --> 16:32.557
(Beeping continues)

16:32.559 --> 16:34.359
(Elevator bell dings)

16:34.361 --> 16:35.493
Okay, I am sorry.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.661
I didn't mean it.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.364
Boss, these...
This thing is sentient,

16:39.366 --> 16:41.632
and it's only loyal
to its master.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.104
Or the plug was loose.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.638
Um, the Nola team

16:47.640 --> 16:50.108
processed the items found
in Luca's apartment.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.542
No prints.
Bug?

16:51.544 --> 16:54.112
They actually found a second
one in Luca's knife case.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.380
Both are customizable

16:55.382 --> 16:57.248
and untraceable.
Cause of death?

16:57.250 --> 16:59.183
Surprise, surprise.
Blood work came back

16:59.185 --> 17:00.284
showing signs
of poison.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.286
What kind?
Don't know yet.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.655
Well, how were they poisoned?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.791
We don't know
that, either.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.127
Mass spectrometer is being
particularly stubborn with me.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.595
But I will know more later.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.666
I hope.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.203
Gibbs: Poison.
What kind? From where?

17:19.205 --> 17:21.272
Leon, we're lucky
we got that much.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.640
Agent McGee is playing
the part of miss Sciuto?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.075
Yeah, and it's a
hard role to fill.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.094
Mm.
Secdef?

17:26.095 --> 17:28.112
Has no idea why commander lively
was coming to see him.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.448
Only that it concerned
a matter of national security.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.550
What was he doing
on jenner blye's plane?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.253
Secdef called blye industries
to ask that same question.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.255
They've got corporate offices
in anacostia.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.673
Yeah? And?

17:38.674 --> 17:40.090
Mr. blye has been
ducking secdef's calls.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.292
That's a bad idea.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.528
Yeah, even for a big shot.

17:43.530 --> 17:48.166
I'm thinking it's time we bring
Tony stark in for questioning.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.069
Iron man.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.403
Smug.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.138
Tech mogul/superhero.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.774
My son collects them.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.844
I guess now so do I.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.513
Mm-hmm.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.815
(Door closes)

18:03.817 --> 18:05.817
(Lively chatter,
carnival music playing)

18:05.819 --> 18:07.085
There you go, baby.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.386
(Groans)
Going crazy.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.621
We've been looking for Luca
for hours, and nothing.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.523
You're sure he
sent the text?

18:12.524 --> 18:14.424
Who else would be hiding here
and have me go through

18:14.427 --> 18:16.394
a roller coaster nightmare
in order to find him?

18:16.396 --> 18:17.395
You're right.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.398
It's silly, but
very Sciuto.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.499
I knew it.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.733
What?

18:22.735 --> 18:23.801
We're being followed.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.403
Scary guy with
an earpiece.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.438
Are you armed?
Yes.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.639
And don't worry,
we're safe.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.774
How do you know?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.326
Because that is a
park security guard.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.877
I called ahead, told them
we were gonna be here

18:32.879 --> 18:34.445
and to keep an
eye out for Luca.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.780
Well, I didn't know that.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.181
And Luca doesn't know that.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.182
That's why he's hiding.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.367
Hiding where?

18:39.368 --> 18:40.551
Someplace scarier
than the conniption.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.619
Oh, wait.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.590
That a headless hippo?

18:45.592 --> 18:48.226
It's a clue! From Luca.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.235
Is there still a
haunted house here?

19:02.742 --> 19:07.445
You'd think an award for global
design would be... cooler.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.413
(Door opens)

19:09.415 --> 19:10.681
Agent Gibbs and bishop.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.550
Sorry for the wait.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.418
As you can imagine, we're
all still in shock here.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.753
Dalton greenbrick,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.755
chief financial officer
at blye industries.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.357
This is our head of security,

19:19.359 --> 19:20.791
Blake huxley.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.527
Do you think this was an
attempt on Mr. blye's life?

19:22.529 --> 19:23.528
(Chuckles):
Of course not.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.795
And please,
lower your voice.

19:24.797 --> 19:25.796
Gibbs:
Okay.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.532
Let's talk inside.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.467
I'm afraid Mr. blye is
on an overseas call.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.536
He asked us to come out
and answer your questions.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.671
We asked to talk to blye.
Of course.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.274
But I'm afraid
he wouldn't be any help.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.675
Huxley:
Look, you should know,

19:37.677 --> 19:39.544
Mr. blye has gone missing.
Blake.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.445
He was meeting with

19:41.447 --> 19:43.814
Navy commander Gil lively
in New Orleans.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.783
About?
We're hoping you could tell us.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.251
Because it was
the last time

19:47.253 --> 19:48.286
anyone saw him.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.287
So you do think he's dead.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.488
Okay, that's enough.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.423
I'm sure he's fine.
In the meantime...

19:52.425 --> 19:53.691
You'll be reporting
a missing person.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.330
(Beeping)

20:00.567 --> 20:02.633
(Elevator bell dings)
(Mouthing)

20:03.603 --> 20:05.536
Boss, I.D.'D
the poison.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.306
Uh, it is called
batrachotoxin.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.841
Secreted from a south
American poison dart frog.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.744
Causes paralysis and/or death
just by touching it,

20:13.746 --> 20:15.613
let alone ingesting it.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.481
It was in the airplane food?
Actually, on the utensils.

20:17.483 --> 20:21.219
It's laced with a unique
aerosol form I can't trace.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.920
Well, the silverware
points to the chef--

20:22.922 --> 20:24.455
whoever took
Luca's place.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.324
Still no I.D.,
and it would've meant

20:26.326 --> 20:27.758
poisoning themselves.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.728
So why all the secrecy if
it was a suicide mission?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.430
Who else had access to the food?

20:32.432 --> 20:34.265
Well, the Nola team
sent over security footage

20:34.267 --> 20:35.433
from the hangar.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.468
It's dated
the night before the flight.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.604
Shows the last
living person

20:39.606 --> 20:41.939
seen with the
poisoned silverware.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.412
Luca.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.649
(Metal clangs)

20:51.651 --> 20:53.451
Tony:
"Colossal fun."

20:53.453 --> 20:56.654
(Grunting)

20:57.624 --> 20:59.857
(Grunts)

21:00.827 --> 21:02.026
Oh...

21:02.028 --> 21:03.027
All right, Abby.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.895
Come on over.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.633
There was a gate
just back there.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.940
Haunted house used to be here?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.575
Yeah, there was a
headless skeleton outside

21:17.577 --> 21:19.043
and it scared
Luca really bad,

21:19.045 --> 21:21.479
but mom and dad made him
go on the ride anyway.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.748
He didn't say a word
to them for weeks.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.516
Weren't your
parents deaf?

21:25.518 --> 21:28.619
Yeah, he would just keep
his hands in his pockets.

21:28.621 --> 21:32.323
Well, you are the only Sciuto
i see around here.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.491
Right.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.492
Okay.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.559
Let's split up.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.728
You go that way.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.032
Abby:
Luca?

21:44.304 --> 21:45.670
Luca!

21:50.343 --> 21:52.576
Luca?

21:56.649 --> 21:57.848
Luca.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.351
Man:
Abby?

22:03.756 --> 22:06.524
Luca? Luca.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.592
(Phone ringing)

22:10.029 --> 22:11.028
Yeah, boss.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.930
Oh, my god.

22:12.932 --> 22:13.964
(Panting)

22:13.966 --> 22:15.366
Hey.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.634
Oh...

22:18.571 --> 22:20.571
Oh, my god.
Are you okay?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.406
What is going on?
I don't know.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.108
I woke up yesterday in a motel

22:24.110 --> 22:25.710
with no idea how I got there.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.645
Then I saw on TV
that the plane

22:27.647 --> 22:29.046
I was supposed
to be on crashed,

22:29.048 --> 22:31.415
and my apartment
has been ransacked...

22:32.385 --> 22:34.118
I don't know who
to trust except you.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.453
(Exhales)

22:35.455 --> 22:36.721
But I knew you'd come, Abby.

22:38.958 --> 22:39.990
(Sighs)

22:39.992 --> 22:41.392
Ton... Tony!

22:41.394 --> 22:43.594
Tony!
We're over here!

22:43.596 --> 22:44.595
You brought the cops?

22:44.597 --> 22:46.130
Abby:
He's not a... he's...

22:46.132 --> 22:47.598
Tony's...

22:47.600 --> 22:48.999
A friend, with a badge.

22:49.001 --> 22:52.503
Yeah. All right, boss, will do.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.873
Luca, this is
very special agent Tony DiNozzo.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.875
Tony, this...

22:57.877 --> 23:00.378
Is my little brother, Luca.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.013
It's nice to meet you, Luca.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.548
You're under arrest.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.917
What?

23:09.055 --> 23:11.722
Luca, what did you do?

23:22.168 --> 23:24.502
McGee:
So Navy commander lively

23:24.504 --> 23:26.504
met with jenner blye
in New Orleans.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.705
We have no idea why.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.140
And afterwards,
the commander flew to D.C.

23:29.142 --> 23:31.475
To meet with the
secretary of defense.

23:31.477 --> 23:32.643
About national security.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.111
Ominous, if not
a little broad.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.447
Except everyone on
that plane was killed

23:36.449 --> 23:38.716
with a powerful
neurotoxin, including

23:38.718 --> 23:40.117
the mystery man who took
Luca's place as chef.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.986
Still no I.D. On that
body, by the way.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.555
It's not looking good
for jenner blye, either.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.923
Is he a suspect?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.725
No, another victim.
Louisiana state police

23:47.727 --> 23:49.527
just I.D.'D his car.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.029
They're dragging the river
for a body.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.965
Everyone connected to
the secret meeting in Nola

23:54.967 --> 23:56.967
is being targeted.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.571
So our only living clue
is the real chef.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.807
Maybe Luca knows
what this is all about.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.141
What is this all about?

24:04.143 --> 24:05.509
Abby, hey.
How-how was...

24:05.511 --> 24:06.811
How was my car ride?
It was awful.

24:06.813 --> 24:07.845
Tony wouldn't
even let me

24:07.847 --> 24:09.180
speak to my own brother.

24:09.182 --> 24:10.748
Is Luca really a murder suspect?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.149
We're about to find out.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.884
He's in interrogation now.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.787
Who's questioning him?

24:18.991 --> 24:20.090
Abby:
Gibbs!

24:20.092 --> 24:21.592
No, wait!

24:21.594 --> 24:22.793
Don't hurt Luca!
Abbs...

24:22.795 --> 24:24.662
I'm just gonna talk to him.
Yeah, but...

24:24.664 --> 24:26.730
Luca's really fragile,

24:26.732 --> 24:30.701
and-and you're really... you.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.870
What's your point?

24:32.872 --> 24:34.138
He's not a killer.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.841
He's... he's innocent
and he's sweet.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.943
And... and he's

24:38.945 --> 24:40.945
a Sciuto.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.481
And did I mention
he's-he's innocent?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.515
Then we shouldn't
have a problem.

24:44.517 --> 24:45.649
I'm sure he'll tell you

24:45.651 --> 24:46.784
everything he knows.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.619
Luca:
<i> I'm not saying anything</i>

24:48.621 --> 24:50.187
without a lawyer.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.723
Sorry, agent Gibbs.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.926
Is my sister
watching this?

24:55.928 --> 24:57.061
(Rapid knocking at door)

24:57.063 --> 24:58.829
(Exhales)

25:02.935 --> 25:03.934
Luca!

25:03.936 --> 25:05.536
Abby, I can handle myself.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.738
I told you that
Gibbs hates lawyers.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.940
Let me break him.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.743
Abbs, either you do
this, or I will.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.212
What are you doing?

25:15.214 --> 25:17.748
You told me what cops do
to people without lawyers

25:17.750 --> 25:19.517
and that I should
always ask for one.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.552
True.
But this is different.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.087
How?
This is...

25:23.089 --> 25:24.688
Family.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.056
Luca,

25:26.058 --> 25:28.726
you're suspected
of poisoning

25:28.728 --> 25:30.661
everyone on that plane.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.196
That wasn't my fault.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.532
It was last-minute.
I used what I had.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.934
But I knew that the artichoke
wouldn't keep overnight

25:36.936 --> 25:38.936
and that the beet puree
wouldn't reheat well...

25:38.938 --> 25:40.571
Luca, I'm
not talking

25:40.573 --> 25:42.273
about food poisoning.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.707
I'm talking about

25:43.709 --> 25:46.110
batrachotoxin poisoning.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.678
Is that a preservative?

25:48.714 --> 25:50.014
They told me

25:50.016 --> 25:52.750
to prep the food
to fly to D.C. the next day.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.718
You hate to fly.
I wanted to surprise you.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.719
Next thing I know,

25:55.721 --> 25:56.921
I woke up dumped in a motel

25:56.923 --> 25:57.922
with a hangover.

25:57.924 --> 25:58.989
You don't drink!

25:58.991 --> 26:01.275
Someone drugged me.

26:01.276 --> 26:03.560
And now everyone on that plane
is dead and I'm scared.

26:03.563 --> 26:04.862
That's all I know!

26:04.864 --> 26:06.564
Oh...

26:06.566 --> 26:07.798
Okay.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.000
That's what you used
to say to mom and dad

26:10.002 --> 26:11.769
when you weren't telling
the whole truth.

26:11.771 --> 26:12.770
What?

26:12.772 --> 26:15.272
"That's all I know."

26:15.274 --> 26:18.576
You lie better
with your hands

26:18.578 --> 26:20.110
than you do
your mouth.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.948
Are you protecting someone?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.766
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.006
He knows sign?

26:50.209 --> 26:52.142
Yeah.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.181
Luca is drawn to...

26:57.183 --> 26:58.749
Strays.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.017
Anyone with

27:00.019 --> 27:02.720
a hard-luck case

27:02.722 --> 27:04.722
and a sob story.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.324
He wants to help them.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.360
Isn't that what
you do, Abby?

27:09.362 --> 27:11.061
Abby:
I look on
the bright side.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.229
That's the same
thing, Abby.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.764
No, it's not.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.766
I look on the bright side,

27:15.768 --> 27:19.103
but I acknowledge the fact
that there is a dark side.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.205
You are just...

27:21.207 --> 27:24.775
All... all...
All sunshine.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.044
I didn't realize there was
someone more positive than Abby.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.213
And it gets him
in trouble.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.347
Especially with women.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.815
Well, I don't need your help.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.752
Pet shelter owner.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.287
Oh. She said they'd have
to put down all of the animals

27:37.289 --> 27:39.423
if I didn't get six
of my friends to invest.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.025
It was a Ponzi scheme.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.092
I try to help people.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.794
And, like I've told agent Gibbs,

27:43.796 --> 27:45.513
Eva's different.

27:45.514 --> 27:47.231
She's running away
from an abusive husband,

27:47.233 --> 27:49.833
and we connected
in a prayer group at church.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.168
She's honest.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.836
So the guns, the money,

27:52.838 --> 27:54.705
listening device
found in your apartment...

27:54.707 --> 27:57.007
Not mine
and not hers.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.243
Someone's setting me up,
and it's putting her in danger.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.844
That's why you wouldn't talk?

28:00.846 --> 28:02.346
Look, I cook for jenner blye,

28:02.348 --> 28:04.748
the most innovative man
in the world.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.851
He's constantly under public
scrutiny, corporate espionage.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.453
I serve dinner,
but I have no idea

28:09.455 --> 28:11.855
what Mr. blye
discusses over it.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.858
Now, will you help me find Eva
and protect her?

28:14.860 --> 28:15.993
Have you tried calling her?

28:15.995 --> 28:17.995
She mostly calls me.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.730
She changes cell phones a lot.

28:19.732 --> 28:20.731
Do you have a picture?

28:20.733 --> 28:23.033
She won't let me take pictures.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.135
Just in case her ex
ever comes around.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.870
Okay, so does she have,

28:26.872 --> 28:27.871
um,

28:27.873 --> 28:30.474
say, a... last name?

28:37.950 --> 28:40.150
Sonja:
<i> Yeah,</i>

28:40.152 --> 28:42.152
she definitely
took advantage of him.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.454
Sounds like it.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.923
Someone wants to steal
tech secrets from jenner blye,

28:45.925 --> 28:47.291
and they bug
his personal chef.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.326
Yeah. The chef may not
be in the meeting,

28:49.328 --> 28:50.994
but he's in the house.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.262
Poor Luca.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.897
Oh.

28:53.899 --> 28:57.167
You, uh, been used in
a relationship, there, Tony?

28:57.169 --> 28:58.936
Or vice versa?

28:58.938 --> 29:00.170
No comment.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.039
Wounds are still fresh?

29:02.041 --> 29:03.974
You follow up on the rest
of little brother's story?

29:03.976 --> 29:05.175
Yes, and it checks out.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.311
Motel owner said
he saw him leave the place.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.913
Seemed out of it.
He was missing a shoe.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.249
Sonja:
We figure Eva took out Luca

29:12.251 --> 29:14.752
and then put the mystery man
in his place.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.187
Are we sure this woman
stayed at Luca's place?

29:17.189 --> 29:19.389
Said she's been crashing
for the last two weeks.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.792
Who stays at someone's house
for two weeks

29:21.794 --> 29:23.894
and doesn't leave any
fingerprints or hair?

29:23.896 --> 29:25.262
This woman didn't
want to be identified.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.030
I don't know why.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.799
She cute.

29:28.801 --> 29:29.867
You found a picture?

29:29.869 --> 29:31.268
Not exactly.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.008
Hmm.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.443
You can use this?

29:39.445 --> 29:41.545
We use artist sketches
all the time.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.313
And those are just from
witnesses' memories.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.216
This artist had the subject
right in front of him.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.851
It's a cartoon, Abby.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.787
Yeah, it exaggerates
key features.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.121
I just have
to pull them back.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.290
And because I know what
Luca actually looks like,

29:53.292 --> 29:55.926
I have a baseline for how
the artist exaggerates.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.263
Abby:
Ah.
It works.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.798
Of course it works.
Well, who is she?

30:00.800 --> 30:04.101
I'm looking for
database matches right now.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.273
That was fast.
That was, like, super fast.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.575
Well, that's good, right?
Not really.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.978
Eva's in four different
agency databases.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.947
Make that five.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.382
Including ours.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.850
Why?

30:19.852 --> 30:23.220
Vance:
Because Eva azarova
works for

30:23.222 --> 30:25.455
Russian diplomatic counselor
Anton pavlenko.

30:25.457 --> 30:26.957
Are you sure?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.258
She doesn't have
an accent.

30:28.260 --> 30:32.196
CIA, NSA, homeland
and interpol

30:32.198 --> 30:34.832
all have aliases
matching her description.

30:34.834 --> 30:37.401
They can't confirm it,
but it's pretty clear

30:37.403 --> 30:40.337
she's a sleeper agent
and she's using you.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.307
Well, she must have
a good reason.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.043
Abby:
Luca, we've worked
with her boss before.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.912
So he's a good guy, then.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.214
Only when it suits him.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.982
Gibbs, you think
pavlenko's behind all this?

30:51.984 --> 30:53.283
We're gonna find out.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.418
By finding Eva.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.153
I'm sure she'll explain
everything.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.488
And I'm sure she is
long gone by now.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.190
She would've
called me first.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.592
(Phone ringing)

31:03.996 --> 31:04.995
Hello?

31:04.997 --> 31:06.463
Eva.

31:06.465 --> 31:07.464
You okay?
What's going...

31:07.466 --> 31:08.465
I'm fine, Luca.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.367
(Eva continues indistinctly)

31:11.570 --> 31:13.637
She's calling for you.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.379
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.521
Agent Gibbs, hello.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.390
Now that NCIS is involved,

31:33.392 --> 31:35.425
no doubt you've found out
who I am

31:35.427 --> 31:37.160
and who I work for.

31:37.162 --> 31:39.463
Yeah. You planning on using
me like you're using Luca?

31:39.465 --> 31:41.398
Now, wait a minute.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.900
Anton told me

31:42.902 --> 31:44.902
you aren't one for small talk.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.337
No. Or cryptic
phone calls.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.939
Things are not always
as they seem.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.107
(Chuckles):
Really?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.108
Okay.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.910
Tony! Move!

31:52.912 --> 31:55.145
Gibbs told me
to arrest Luca.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.613
It's not about that, yet.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.548
Gibbs is on the phone
with our Russian spy,

31:58.550 --> 32:00.350
and I need to run a trace, fast.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.551
First, her name is Eva.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.053
Second, you can really do that?

32:03.055 --> 32:04.755
If you didn't think
i could do it, Luca,

32:04.756 --> 32:06.456
then why'd you disconnect your
phone while you were in hiding?

32:06.458 --> 32:07.691
You told me
the government can track it.

32:07.693 --> 32:08.692
I didn't know you could.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.494
I am the government.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.662
Mm.

32:11.664 --> 32:14.264
(Computer trilling)

32:14.266 --> 32:16.633
Wow. Cool.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.368
But what happens
when you find her?

32:18.370 --> 32:19.703
Gibbs happens.

32:19.705 --> 32:20.971
Oh, no.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.306
It's not like he just goes out

32:22.308 --> 32:23.473
and shoots spies on the spot.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.342
I haven't heard from
Trent kort lately.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.145
I'm calling to ask that you not
contact counselor pavlenko

32:28.147 --> 32:29.513
via official channels.
(Gibbs laughs)

32:29.515 --> 32:31.515
That's kind of funny.
It's never official with him.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.984
Lives depend on it, agent Gibbs.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.652
Then tell me how
to contact him.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.021
You'll figure something out.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.022
(Phone beeps)

32:39.024 --> 32:40.657
Did you get that trace?

32:40.659 --> 32:43.026
Kinda. The call was
digitally rerouted

32:43.028 --> 32:45.429
and then terminated
before I got all the details,

32:45.431 --> 32:47.564
but Eva is
definitely somewhere

32:47.566 --> 32:50.000
on the 700 block of k street.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.301
That's a lot of doors
to knock on.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.303
Yeah, and it's not like
one of them's gonna have

32:53.305 --> 32:55.305
a sign outside that says
"Russian hangout."

32:55.307 --> 32:57.074
Actually, there is.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.475
Tusovka.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.377
It's a four-star restaurant
known for

33:00.379 --> 33:03.747
borsch with caviar and sour
cream, and for refusing service

33:03.749 --> 33:05.615
to anyone who doesn't
speak Russian.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.352
"Tusovka" is actually
Russian for, uh...

33:08.354 --> 33:10.287
Hangout.
It's probably just
a coincidence.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.421
Or it's a trap.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.556
Eva wouldn't do that.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.157
But if she is there, b-be nice!

33:14.159 --> 33:15.158
(Elevator bell dings)

33:15.160 --> 33:17.361
Please!

33:33.712 --> 33:35.746
Federal agents.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.726
Agent Gibbs.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.030
I am honored
you could join me.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.197
Agent DiNozzo.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.533
Tony:
Eva-- where is she?

33:56.535 --> 33:58.668
In New Orleans,
where I want her.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.805
This was
a technological ruse.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.375
Clearly my time with NCIS
has rubbed off.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.610
Have a seat.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.313
Please.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.320
Drink?

34:17.322 --> 34:18.789
Talk.

34:18.791 --> 34:23.326
The last time we talked,
i helped you find a killer.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.561
You're looking for repayment?

34:24.563 --> 34:25.829
Hardly.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.165
I'm helping yet again.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.367
That is why we must
meet in secret.

34:30.369 --> 34:35.305
I'm going against my government
and risking my life.

34:37.142 --> 34:39.443
Perhaps when we are finished
here, you'll believe me.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.244
Try me.

34:41.246 --> 34:45.582
The man who took Luca Sciuto's
place on that plane

34:45.584 --> 34:47.417
was one of my agents.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.653
He was going
to represent me

34:49.655 --> 34:51.855
in the meeting with
your secretary of defense.

34:51.857 --> 34:54.257
The commander knew there was
a Russian operative on board?

34:54.259 --> 34:56.159
It was his idea.
I can't very well be seen

34:56.161 --> 34:57.160
at the Pentagon these days.

34:57.162 --> 35:00.430
Whoa. Back up.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.099
The murders on the plane.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.101
Not my doing.
Quite the opposite.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.635
I want to save lives.

35:05.637 --> 35:06.636
The meeting in New Orleans.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.804
I arranged it.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.739
Bull.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.475
I'm trying to prevent war.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.210
No matter what you
think of me personally,

35:13.212 --> 35:15.145
don't question that!

35:15.147 --> 35:17.147
That was a gift.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.782
Don't spill.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.256
You need it more than me.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.664
I found out my
government was

35:34.666 --> 35:38.401
planning to steal technology
that Mr. blye had developed

35:38.403 --> 35:39.736
for the American military.

35:39.738 --> 35:45.509
I spent two days
in New Orleans,

35:45.511 --> 35:48.512
and what I saw...

35:48.514 --> 35:50.680
Confirmed everything.

35:50.682 --> 35:53.383
The commander was flying to D.C.
to go public.

35:54.353 --> 35:57.487
Ever heard of...

35:57.489 --> 35:59.189
Project manta ray?

36:02.528 --> 36:04.895
Its theft could start a war.

36:04.897 --> 36:07.597
We must prevent that, together.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.801
(Gasps)

36:16.275 --> 36:17.541
Counselor?

36:18.277 --> 36:19.276
Call an ambulance.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.277
(Wheezing)

36:20.279 --> 36:22.212
Counselor.

36:23.815 --> 36:26.883
(Wheezing)

36:31.957 --> 36:33.590
(Camera clicking)

36:33.592 --> 36:35.325
McGee:
<i> Well, the swabs show</i>

36:35.327 --> 36:38.728
that the vodka bottle was laced
with the neurotoxin.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.664
Gibbs touched
that bottle.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.866
Luckily, it was
only on the cap,

36:42.868 --> 36:44.501
waiting for someone
to open it.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.203
He said he got it as a gift.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.388
From who?

36:47.389 --> 36:48.572
This means he was
telling the truth

36:48.574 --> 36:49.973
about risking his life.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.441
The Russians behind this?

36:51.443 --> 36:53.944
Great. It's the '80s
all over again.

36:53.946 --> 36:57.247
You're right, he jokes
when under stress.

36:57.249 --> 36:58.381
That supposed to be about Zoe?

36:58.383 --> 37:00.283
I heard it got physical.
Yes, it did.

37:00.285 --> 37:01.651
We went to dinner,

37:01.653 --> 37:04.554
decided things really
weren't working out,

37:04.556 --> 37:08.592
agreed to end it and,
uh, say our good-byes.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.262
The next morning.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.364
Hmm.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.766
Consulate's already on their
way to collect the body.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.435
Yes.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.705
Except it's our only clue
as to where pavlenko's been

37:21.707 --> 37:23.607
and what manta ray
actually is.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.575
Yes.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.311
Okay. Good talk.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.915
I told you Eva was good.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.251
We don't know
that for sure.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.754
You just said the guy she was
working with was helping.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.657
Yeah, but she
could've killed him.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.826
The case is still open.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.361
You're going after her.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.764
We are going after whoever
murdered these people.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.599
It wasn't her.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.968
After the last two days,
how can you say that?

37:51.970 --> 37:53.670
Innocent until proven guilty.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.038
You taught me that.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.906
Mom and dad, too.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.475
Yeah, three years ago,

37:58.477 --> 38:01.478
when you told me we were
adopted, it all made sense.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.046
It's why we are
who we are,

38:03.048 --> 38:05.515
you and me.

38:05.517 --> 38:09.486
Our family takes people in,
helps them, sight unseen.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.689
And I need you to accept me.

38:12.691 --> 38:15.492
Sunshine, unicorn farts and all.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.500
This place has good fries,
but the coffee's crap.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.069
Do not say that to
Gibbs. (Chuckles)

38:26.071 --> 38:27.904
Stop trying to protect me.

38:30.542 --> 38:34.544
I'm getting on a plane
back home first thing tomorrow.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.381
What?

38:41.086 --> 38:42.719
Why?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.721
You could still be in danger.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.627
Luca?

38:52.030 --> 38:54.731
Are you in love with Eva?

38:54.733 --> 38:58.001
Please stay out of it.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.637
And please stop worrying.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.849
Want answers.
Body's our best bet.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.451
Can't ever be easy, can it?

39:14.453 --> 39:15.518
(Chuckles):
No.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.355
Well, then I guess...

39:18.357 --> 39:19.656
Bring it on.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.991
Van's already on the way to you.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.869
Think we better stick
to country roads, doctor.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.673
Yeah, well, we may have to take
a couple of freeways.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.776
This is so exciting!

39:39.778 --> 39:41.077
Absconding to New Orleans

39:41.079 --> 39:43.146
under the cover of night.
(Laughs)

39:43.148 --> 39:47.584
Yeah, the only thing we have to
decide is when to stop for tea.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.988
(Tires screeching,
engine revving)

39:55.560 --> 39:56.993
Whoa!

39:56.995 --> 39:58.061
(Tires screeching)

40:04.836 --> 40:06.803
(Guns clicking)

40:07.773 --> 40:09.072
Doctor.
