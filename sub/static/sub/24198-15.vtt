WEBVTT

00:09.150 --> 00:11.019
>>> AT THE JIM JEFFERIES SHOW

00:11.020 --> 00:13.818
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORALLY
CORRUPT CORPORATIONS LIKE AMAZON.

00:13.821 --> 00:17.619
DO YOU KNOW THEIR WORKERS AREN'T
ALLOWED BATHROOM BREAKS?

00:17.620 --> 00:20.619
LUCKILY AMAZON PRIME CAN SEND
THEM A CATHETER IN TWO DAYS.

00:20.620 --> 00:26.447
THEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF THE NATION'S
YOUNGEST SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRES, KYLIE JENNER.

00:26.450 --> 00:29.519
A REAL RICHES TO RICHES STORY.

00:29.520 --> 00:35.277
AND COMETIC CON TO TALK ABOUT THE HURTFUL
STEREOTYPES IN THE WORLD OF COMIC BOOKS.

00:35.280 --> 00:39.578
WE'LL HEAR WHAT SOME SMELLY VIRGIN
NERDS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

00:39.580 --> 00:45.620
LET'S CARRY ON, LET'S GET THE
SHOW STARTED.

00:48.620 --> 01:02.849
*

01:02.850 --> 01:06.447
>>> WELCOME TO "THE JIM JEFFERIES
SHOW." I'M JIM JEFFERIES.

01:06.450 --> 01:11.877
LAST WEEK WAS ZAM PRIME DAY. DID
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD PRIME DAY?

01:11.880 --> 01:13.879
ATMOSPHERE OH, YES.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.679
AS A KID NOTHING WAS MORE
EXCITING THAN AMAZON PRIME EVE.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.319
WE'D DECORATE THE BEZOS, STAY UP
ALL NIGHT EAGERLY AWAITING THE

01:23.320 --> 01:27.619
DRONES COMING DOWN THE CHIMNEY
BRINGING BOOKS, LAUNDRY

01:27.620 --> 01:30.219
DETERGENT AND VCRs, ALL THE
WHILE MINING OUR PERSONAL DATA.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.779
OH, THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

01:32.780 --> 01:36.478
WELL, IF YOU CELEBRATED PRIME DAY YOU
PROBABLY SCORED SOME GREAT DEALS.

01:36.481 --> 01:39.618
BUT YOU ALSO PROBABLY ED
OVER A LOT OF PEOPLE.

01:39.621 --> 01:43.149
>> IT'S DESCRIBED AS A CUTTHROAT
CORPORATE JUNGLE WHERE WORKERS

01:43.150 --> 01:48.449
ARE PITTED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER,
80-HOUR WORKWEEKS ARE THE NORM,

01:48.450 --> 01:50.020
FALLING ILL CAN MEAN YOU'RE OUT
OF A JOB.

01:50.020 --> 01:50.980
>> HOW BAD IS IT?

01:50.981 --> 01:57.417
WELL, FOR ONE, AMAZON WAREHOUSE WORKERS PEE IN
BOTTLES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TAKE TOILET BREAKS.

01:57.420 --> 02:02.579
MEANWHILE CEO JEFF BEETS ZOES IS
WORTH ABOUT $150 BILLION.

02:02.580 --> 02:07.749
THINK WHAT HE COULD DO WITH THAT
MONEY FOR HIS EMPLOYEES.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.979
THEY COULD BE BPEEING IN GOLD
GOBLETS.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.720
YOU'D THINK THEY'D PUT THAT IN
THE CORNER, RIGHT?

02:12.721 --> 02:20.679
THAT GUY'S EITHER TAKING TOO
MANY OR NOT ENOUGH VITAMINS.

02:20.680 --> 02:24.649
LAST YEAR AMAZON
PAID NO INCOME TAX.

02:24.650 --> 02:28.250
BUT THE EMPLOYEES SEE
NO BENEFITS AT ALL.

02:28.251 --> 02:30.619
>> ACCOUNTS RECOUNT ANECDOTES

02:30.620 --> 02:31.550
FROM FORMER EMPLOYEES, FROM ONE

02:31.551 --> 02:33.349
WHO SAID NEARLY EVERY PERSON I

02:33.350 --> 02:35.379
WORK WITH I SAW CRY AT THEIR

02:35.380 --> 02:36.549
DESK, MEN INCLUDED.

02:36.550 --> 02:41.278
TO A WOMAN WHO MISCARRIED TWINS BUT
WENT ON A BUSINESS TRIP THE NEXT DAY.

02:41.281 --> 02:45.348
HER BOSS, SHE SAYS, TOLD HER, I'M SORRY, THE
WORK IS STILL GOING TO NEED TO GET DONE.

02:45.351 --> 02:49.249
>> WOW.

02:49.250 --> 02:49.820
YEAH.

02:49.821 --> 02:54.448
THEY PRESSURED A WOMAN TO WORK THE
DAY AFTER SHE HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

02:54.450 --> 02:56.978
AND I THOUGHT AMAZON WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE GOOD WITH DELIVERIES.

02:56.981 --> 03:02.519
ZARM ALSO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
PROFITING OFF RISSISM.

03:02.520 --> 03:08.147
RECENTLY LIKE THIS LYNCHING DECAL, BECAUSE
LET BE HONEST, IT WILL BE ON A TRACK.

03:08.150 --> 03:13.679
AND NOT ONE BUT TWO DIFFERENT
CHINESE BOY COSTUMES.

03:13.680 --> 03:18.017
FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
DOING UNDERNEATH THE BLURRED HEADS.

03:18.020 --> 03:23.819
MAYBE THEY'RE PUTTING IN TWO
CONTACTS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

03:23.820 --> 03:31.977
ANYWAY, SHAME ON YOU FOR SELLING THESE, ZAM,
SHAME ON THE CHINESE BOY WHO SEWED THEM.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.877
AMAZON EMPLOYEES IN EUROPE HAVE GONE ON STRIKE
AND CALLED FOR BOYCOTT AND THEY'RE WONDERING IF

03:35.880 --> 03:36.980
THE UNITED STATES WILL JOIN THE
CAUSE.

03:36.981 --> 03:39.719
AND I SAY YES!

03:39.720 --> 03:43.979
THIS MAKES ME NEVER WANT TO SHOP
AT AMAZON AGAIN!

03:43.980 --> 03:46.020
EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW, SOCKS, YOU
KNOW.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.749
WHERE ELSE AM I GOING TO GET
SOCKS?

03:48.750 --> 03:50.680
I'VE ALWAYS BOUGHT THESE SOCKS
AT AMAZON.

03:50.680 --> 03:59.378
IF YOU CAN TELL ME ANOTHER WAY TO
GET SOCKS, I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT.

03:59.380 --> 04:04.979
GRANDMOTHER BOTH MADE AND
PURCHASED SOCKS FOR ME.

04:04.980 --> 04:11.847
OF COURSE WE'LL BOYCOTT AMAZON. THE ONLY THING WE
HATE MORE THAN INJUSTICE IS INCONVENIENCE ARE.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.449
WE KNOW GIANT COMPANIES PROFIT
FROM HUMAN SUFFERING.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.119
APPLE HAD USE CHILD LABOR.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.779
FACEBOOK IS BRIMMING WITH HATE
SPEECH.

04:18.781 --> 04:22.748
UBER HAS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH SEXUAL
HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE.

04:22.751 --> 04:25.579
WHICH IS PARTICULARLY UNSETTLING
SINCE THE WORKPLACE IS TYPICALLY

04:25.580 --> 04:33.647
A TOYOTA PRIUS AND THE HR DEPARTMENT IS A
BOBBLEHEAD WHO TURNS A BLIND EYE TO ASSAULT.

04:33.650 --> 04:36.849
THESE COMPANIES ARE PART OF OUR
DAILY LIVES.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.519
WE WON'T STOP USING THEM.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.679
BESIDES, HOW WILL EVERYONE KNOW
I'M AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT IF

04:42.680 --> 04:45.680
I CAN'T TAKE AN UBER TO THE
PROTEST, AND I CAN'T TAKE

04:45.681 --> 04:48.579
INSTAGRAM PICTURES WITH MY
iPHONE ANY NEED TO VIOLATE HUMAN

04:48.580 --> 04:56.679
RIGHTS IN ORDER TO ADVOCATE FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.749
FOR MANY PEOPLE, BOYCOTTS AREN'T

04:59.750 --> 05:01.049
EVEN A REALLY BIG OPTION.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.649
YOU MIGHT LIVE IN A TOWN WHERE

05:02.650 --> 05:05.119
WALMART IS THE ONLY PLACE TO

05:05.120 --> 05:05.450
SHOP.

05:05.451 --> 05:07.519
OR McDONALD'S IS THE MOST

05:07.520 --> 05:08.220
AFFORDABLE RESTAURANT.

05:08.221 --> 05:09.679
OR THE ONLY SHOE STORE IS RUN BY

05:09.680 --> 05:12.679
A SERIAL KILLER.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.379
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

05:15.380 --> 05:16.719
GO BAREFOOT?

05:16.720 --> 05:19.319
BUT HERE'S MY SOLUTION.

05:19.320 --> 05:19.780
SHAME.

05:19.781 --> 05:20.819
IF YOU BUY SOMETHING FROM A

05:20.820 --> 05:23.219
COMPANY WE KNOW IS BAD, YOU HAVE

05:23.220 --> 05:25.979
TO DO SOMETHING EXTRA GOOD TO

05:25.980 --> 05:26.980
BALANCE IT OUT.

05:26.981 --> 05:29.119
FOR INSTANCE, I HATE HOMOPHOBIA

05:29.120 --> 05:30.979
BUT I LOVE CHICK-FIL-A.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.819
I'M SORRY, I DO, I LOVE

05:32.820 --> 05:33.450
CHICK-FIL-A.

05:33.451 --> 05:37.449
LOOK, GAY PEOPLE CAN MAKE A

05:37.450 --> 05:39.379
COMPARABLE SANDWICH, I'LL BE THE

05:39.380 --> 05:40.150
FIRST IN LINE.

05:40.151 --> 05:41.479
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE AS

05:41.480 --> 05:42.380
GOOD, JUST GET CLOSE.

05:42.381 --> 05:44.079
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE PUTTING

05:44.080 --> 05:44.620
ANY EFFORT IN.

05:44.621 --> 05:45.719
THE GAYS KNOW  ALL

05:45.720 --> 05:47.979
ABOUT CHICKEN.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.979
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT

05:49.980 --> 05:51.049
HOMOPHOBIA THAT MAKES PEOPLE SO

05:51.050 --> 05:52.649
GOOD AT SIGNING POULTRY.

05:52.650 --> 05:55.649
HA HA!

05:55.650 --> 05:57.019
THEY'VE CRACKED IT.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.879
WHAT IF, WHENEVER I ORDER

05:59.880 --> 06:01.349
CHICK-FIL-A, I ALSO DONATE TO AN

06:01.350 --> 06:02.779
ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS GAY

06:02.780 --> 06:03.819
RIGHTS?

06:03.820 --> 06:04.550
IT BALANCES OUT.

06:04.551 --> 06:08.319
PLUS ANY TIME I EAT THERE, I

06:08.320 --> 06:09.579
BAKE MY GAY NEIGHBORS A WEDDING

06:09.580 --> 06:12.079
CAKE TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.149
YOU OBVIOUSLY SEE I EAT A LOT OF

06:15.150 --> 06:15.580
CHICK-FIL-A.

06:15.581 --> 06:17.319
OR MAYBE YOU HATE THAT HOBBY

06:17.320 --> 06:19.049
LOBBY'S HEALTH CARE WON'T COVER

06:19.050 --> 06:20.479
MANY FORMS OF CONTRACEPTION ON

06:20.480 --> 06:21.480
RELIGIOUS GROUNDS.

06:21.481 --> 06:22.679
BUT YOU ALSO REALLY, REALLY LOVE

06:22.680 --> 06:23.050
CRAFTS.

06:23.051 --> 06:25.179
WELL.

06:25.180 --> 06:26.219
WHEN YOU SHOP THERE, MAKE A

06:26.220 --> 06:29.179
DONATION TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.119
THEN WHEN YOU BUY GETTER AND

06:32.120 --> 06:33.120
POSTER BOARD YOU KNOW YOU'VE

06:33.120 --> 06:33.880
PROBABLY PAID FOR AT LEAST ONE

06:33.881 --> 06:36.349
RA ABORTION.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.549
THINK OF IT LIKE A MORALITY

06:38.550 --> 06:38.880
DIET.

06:38.881 --> 06:40.019
YOU TRY TO BALANCE THE GOOD WITH

06:40.020 --> 06:41.049
THE BAD, RIGHT?

06:41.050 --> 06:42.979
YOU FILL YOUR TANK UP WITH BP,

06:42.980 --> 06:46.179
DONATE TO WILDLIFE CONSERVATION.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.849
YOU TAKE AN UBER, DONATE TO

06:47.850 --> 06:49.149
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

06:49.150 --> 06:51.249
SHOP AT URBAN OUTFITTERS, TIE

06:51.250 --> 06:51.980
YOURSELF IN A SACK AND THROW

06:51.981 --> 06:55.119
YOURSELF IN THE OCEAN.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.649
THIS WAY YOU CAN STILL LIVE A

06:56.650 --> 06:58.279
CONVENIENT LIFE AND IN THE END

06:58.280 --> 07:00.279
IT ALL BALANCES OUT.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.119
OR IT WON'T, YOU DON'T CARE.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.579
I HAVE TO ORDER SOME SOCKS,

07:03.580 --> 07:06.820
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:16.080 --> 07:18.079
>>> WELCOME BACK.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.719
WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT TETHIC

07:21.720 --> 07:24.019
OF CORPORATE CEOs, I THINK WE

07:24.020 --> 07:25.849
CAN ALL AGREE THEY'RE ALL RICH

07:25.850 --> 07:28.149
AS .

07:28.150 --> 07:28.980
THAT'S WHY WE'RE FASCINATED BY

07:28.980 --> 07:29.280
THEM.

07:29.281 --> 07:31.719
WE ADMIRE THEM, ENVY THEM, MAKE

07:31.720 --> 07:32.580
CARTOONS FOR OUR KIDS ABOUT

07:32.580 --> 07:32.980
THEM.

07:32.981 --> 07:34.619
NOW THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO ADD A

07:34.620 --> 07:36.449
NEW BILLIONAIRE TO THE LIST.

07:36.450 --> 07:38.149
>> KYLIE JENNER, THE 20-YEAR-OLD

07:38.150 --> 07:40.319
NAMED ONE OF AMERICA'S RICHEST

07:40.320 --> 07:41.180
SELF-MADE WOMEN AFTER TURNING

07:41.181 --> 07:43.049
HER IDEA TO LAUNCH LIP KITS INTO

07:43.050 --> 07:46.249
A $900 MILLION BUSINESS IN JUST

07:46.250 --> 07:47.419
TWO YEARS.

07:47.420 --> 07:49.549
>> WELL, AMERICA'S LATEST

07:49.550 --> 07:52.019
SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE, CALL ME

07:52.020 --> 07:54.249
CRAZY, WHEN SOMEONE IS SELF-MADE

07:54.250 --> 07:54.980
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T

07:54.981 --> 07:57.049
IMMEDIATELY KNOW THE NAMES OF

07:57.050 --> 07:58.779
SPOUSES AND GENDER IDENTITIES OF

07:58.780 --> 08:00.819
THEIR ENTIRE FAMILIES.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.349
KYLIE JENNER WAS BORN INTO THE

08:02.350 --> 08:04.619
MOST OUTLANDISHLY FAMOUS FAMILY

08:04.620 --> 08:05.250
IN AMERICA.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.819
THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU SELF-MADE.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.649
I DIDN'T MICROWAVE A FROZEN

08:09.650 --> 08:11.979
BURRITO AND CALL MYSELF A

08:11.980 --> 08:13.319
SELF-MADE CHEF.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.749
ALTHOUGH I DID ADD A LITTLE

08:14.750 --> 08:17.979
LIGHT DUSTING OF COCAINE.

08:17.980 --> 08:20.079
WHICH IS WHAT I CALL THE

08:20.080 --> 08:25.879
JEFFRIES TOUCH.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.650
SOMETIMES I DON'T EVEN EAT THE

08:26.651 --> 08:30.379
BURRITO.

08:30.380 --> 08:32.979
SO I'LL SAY THIS TO KYLIE

08:32.980 --> 08:33.320
JENNER.

08:33.321 --> 08:35.179
ROB KARDASHIAN HAD ALL THE SAME

08:35.179 --> 08:35.980
OPPORTUNITIES SO HE MUST HAVE

08:35.981 --> 08:40.149
DONE SOMETHING RIGHT.

08:40.150 --> 08:42.249
ROB IS THE ROB CKARDASHIAN OF TE

08:42.250 --> 08:43.749
KARDASHIANS.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.819
SO CONGRATULATIONS, KYLIE.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.479
FIT WASN'T A MAKEUP COMPANY, IT

08:46.480 --> 08:47.579
WOULD HAVE BEEN A FASHION LINE

08:47.580 --> 08:49.619
OR AN ACTING CAREER OR A PARTY

08:49.620 --> 08:51.049
PLANNING BRAND OR A JUICE

08:51.050 --> 08:54.119
FRANCHISE FOR DOGS OR WHATEVER

08:54.120 --> 08:55.519
BULLSHIT SCHEME YOU DECIDED TO

08:55.520 --> 08:56.350
SLAP YOUR  NAME ON.

08:56.351 --> 08:58.679
NOW SHE'S ON THE COVER OF

08:58.680 --> 09:00.979
"FORBES" AND WE'VE BEEN GOOD FOR

09:00.980 --> 09:02.319
HER AND NOT -- OH, NO, SOMEONE

09:02.320 --> 09:04.279
THAT YOUNG TO BE ON THAT COVER

09:04.280 --> 09:04.880
WITH THAT MUCH MONEY?

09:04.880 --> 09:05.580
SOMETHING HORRIBLE MUST HAVE

09:05.581 --> 09:06.979
HAPPENED.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.349
THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME A

09:08.350 --> 09:10.879
BILLIONAIRE IS TO DO ONE OF TWO

09:10.880 --> 09:11.250
THINGS.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.019
NUMBER ONE, HAVE A BILLIONAIRE

09:13.020 --> 09:13.380
PARENT.

09:13.381 --> 09:17.579
TWO, BE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.049
BUT WE STILL LOVE BILLIONAIRES.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.879
I MEAN, THIS COUNTRY ELECTED A

09:20.880 --> 09:23.679
GUY WHO MIGHT BE A BILLIONAIRE.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.879
THE OTHERS TALK OF PRESIDENT

09:25.880 --> 09:27.449
OPRAH OR PRESIDENT MARK CUBAN.

09:27.450 --> 09:31.779
NO, EVERY  BILLIONAIRE

09:31.780 --> 09:32.380
NEEDS TO BE PRESIDENT.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.150
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:33.151 --> 09:34.649
IT'S LIKE SURVIVING A PLANE

09:34.650 --> 09:36.379
WRECK AND DECIDING, OKAY, WE

09:36.380 --> 09:38.649
NEED A LEADER IN THIS GROUP,

09:38.650 --> 09:40.779
CHOOSE THE GUY WHO CLIMBED OVER

09:40.780 --> 09:42.819
THE HEADS OF EVERYBODY ELSE AND

09:42.820 --> 09:44.719
PUSHED THAT CHILD OUT OF THE

09:44.720 --> 09:45.020
WAY.

09:45.021 --> 09:46.579
DEEP DOWN WE KNOW BILLIONAIRES

09:46.580 --> 09:47.050
ARE TERRIBLE.

09:47.051 --> 09:48.319
WE ALSO HAVE THIS THING IN OUR

09:48.320 --> 09:50.319
BRAIN THAT WE THINK ONE DAY, IF

09:50.320 --> 09:53.479
THINGS GO RIGHT, I COULD BE ONE

09:53.480 --> 09:53.850
OF THEM.

09:53.851 --> 09:55.079
THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY OF

09:55.080 --> 09:56.479
BOOKS FULL OF LIES THAT ARE SOLD

09:56.480 --> 09:58.119
TO IDIOTS IN AIRPORTS.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.079
THEY'RE CALLED THINGS LIKE, "10

10:00.080 --> 10:00.850
SECRETS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER

10:00.851 --> 10:03.449
THAN YOU."

10:03.450 --> 10:04.479
WE'RE TOLD IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU

10:04.480 --> 10:07.179
CAN BE SUCCESSFUL.

10:07.180 --> 10:08.449
IT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM.

10:08.450 --> 10:11.119
BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU'RE NOT GOING

10:11.120 --> 10:13.019
TO BE A BILLIONAIRE OR A

10:13.020 --> 10:13.580
MILLIONAIRE.

10:13.581 --> 10:15.249
IN FACT, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

10:15.250 --> 10:19.379
TO BE A MAKE ENDS MEET-INAIRE.

10:19.380 --> 10:23.349
>> SINCE 1979, A 200% RISE OF

10:23.350 --> 10:26.219
THE TOP 1%, THE GAP BETWEEN

10:26.220 --> 10:27.549
EVERYBODY ELSE WIDENING,

10:27.550 --> 10:28.849
ESPECIALLY FOR MIDDLE-INCOME

10:28.850 --> 10:29.280
HOUSEHOLDS.

10:29.281 --> 10:30.379
>> THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER

10:30.380 --> 10:31.120
AND THEY'RE KEEPING EVERYBODY

10:31.121 --> 10:33.419
ELSE DOWN.

10:33.420 --> 10:34.579
SO I GUESS THE MORE ACCURATE

10:34.580 --> 10:39.349
AMERICAN DREAM MIGHT BE, HEY,

10:39.350 --> 10:40.879
OFF.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.619
THAT'S WHY HOLDING UP KYLIE

10:43.620 --> 10:45.249
JENNER AS A SELF-MADE

10:45.250 --> 10:46.050
BILLIONAIRE IS DANGEROUS.

10:46.051 --> 10:47.549
WHY CELEBRATE A PERSON WHO WAS

10:47.550 --> 10:49.119
BORN RICH AND GOT RICHER?

10:49.120 --> 10:51.219
IT GIVES YOUNG PEOPLE A TOTALLY

10:51.220 --> 10:52.579
UNREALISTIC STANDARD OF SUCCESS.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.079
INSTEAD OF ASPIRING TO BE LIKE

10:54.080 --> 10:55.519
KYLIE JENNER, HOW ABOUT A DOSE

10:55.520 --> 10:58.849
OF REALITY?

10:58.850 --> 10:59.620
"FORBES" CAN  OFF WITH

10:59.621 --> 11:04.819
THE SELF-MADE CRAP.

11:04.820 --> 11:05.879
I'D RATHER READ A MAGAZINE

11:05.880 --> 11:09.879
CALLED "REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS."

11:09.880 --> 11:10.979
THIS MONTH'S COVER MODEL IS

11:10.980 --> 11:13.979
STEPHANIE MENDEL.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.419
SHE CLIPPED COUPONS THROUGHOUT

11:15.420 --> 11:17.049
HER TEENS AND HER MOTHER TAUGHT

11:17.050 --> 11:18.549
HER HOW TO COOK SO SHE WOULDN'T

11:18.550 --> 11:21.679
HAVE TO BLOW HER MONEY ON

11:21.680 --> 11:22.979
EXPENSIVE MEALS AND TOOK NIGHT

11:22.980 --> 11:23.320
SCHOOL.

11:23.321 --> 11:25.249
SHE'S TURNED HER AVERAGE

11:25.250 --> 11:26.449
EDUCATION AND ZERO CONNECTIONS

11:26.450 --> 11:29.579
INTO A GREAT JOB AS A NURSING

11:29.580 --> 11:31.679
ASSISTANT WITH A SALARY OF

11:31.680 --> 11:33.249
$36,000, SHE CAN USUALLY MAKE

11:33.250 --> 11:33.580
RENT.

11:33.581 --> 11:34.719
SHE HAS PLENTY OF TIME TO HANG

11:34.720 --> 11:35.979
OUT WITH HER FIVE FRIENDS THAT

11:35.980 --> 11:38.279
MAKE UP FOR 50% OF HER INSTAGRAM

11:38.280 --> 11:39.449
FOLLOWERS.

11:39.450 --> 11:41.049
CONGRATULATIONS, STEPHANIE,

11:41.050 --> 11:42.279
YOU'RE SELF-MADE, YOU MADE IT.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.520
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:54.850 --> 11:57.149
>>> THE BIGGEST NEWS STORY OF

11:57.150 --> 11:59.549
2018 SO FAR IS THE BLOCKBUSTER

11:59.550 --> 12:00.879
SUCCESS OF "BLACK PANTHER."

12:00.880 --> 12:02.749
IT WAS A WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.449
PLUS THOUSANDS OF

12:04.450 --> 12:06.049
AFRICAN-AMERICAN KIDS PACKED

12:06.050 --> 12:07.279
MOVIE THEATERS TO FINALLY SEE A

12:07.280 --> 12:10.849
SUPERHERO WHO LOOKS LIKE THEM.

12:10.850 --> 12:13.679
NOW MARVEL AND D.C. ARE BRINGING

12:13.680 --> 12:14.580
DIVERSE CHARACTERS IN THE

12:14.581 --> 12:15.879
SPOTLIGHT AND EVEN TWEAKING OLD

12:15.880 --> 12:16.280
FAVORITES.

12:16.281 --> 12:18.619
SO I HEADED TO SAN DIEGO

12:18.620 --> 12:19.250
COMIC-CON TO SOAK UP THE

12:19.251 --> 12:21.519
INCLUSIVE VIBES.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.219
BUT I SOON LEARNED THAT FOR SOME

12:24.220 --> 12:25.979
THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF COMICS ARE

12:25.980 --> 12:28.119
FADING AWAY.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.319
SO COMIC BOOK FAN?

12:29.320 --> 12:30.220
>> USED TO BE.

12:30.221 --> 12:31.349
>> WHY USED TO BE?

12:31.350 --> 12:33.279
>> I STOPPED READING IT OVER THE

12:33.280 --> 12:34.020
DIVERSITY ISSUE.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.849
>> RATHER THAN CHANGING COMIC

12:35.850 --> 12:38.179
BOOK CHARACTERS A LITTLE TOO

12:38.180 --> 12:40.979
MUCH, A COMIC BOOK TRADITION, IN

12:40.980 --> 12:42.719
A WAY, EACH CHARACTER SHOULD

12:42.720 --> 12:43.350
LOOK --

12:43.351 --> 12:44.749
>> WHEN THEY START MAKING

12:44.750 --> 12:46.519
SUPERMAN GAY, AQUAMAN

12:46.520 --> 12:47.420
TRANSGENDER, IT'S LIKE -- I

12:47.421 --> 12:50.419
DON'T GO AROUND AND PARADE WHAT

12:50.420 --> 12:51.819
I AM, DON'T GO AROUND AND PARADE

12:51.820 --> 12:52.280
WHAT YOU ARE.

12:52.281 --> 12:55.149
>> OH,  SAKE.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.779
THERE'S AN ACTUAL BACKLASH

12:56.780 --> 12:59.349
AGAINST DIVERSITY IN COMIC

12:59.350 --> 12:59.680
BOOKS.

12:59.681 --> 13:01.749
AND THE MOVEMENT IS LED BY A

13:01.750 --> 13:02.650
SUPER VILLAIN.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.719
HE RUNS A YOUTUBE CHANNEL,

13:05.720 --> 13:07.979
BROADCASTS FROM A SECRET

13:07.980 --> 13:08.880
LAIR/BEDROOM CLOSET.

13:08.881 --> 13:10.749
>> TODAY'S VIDEO IS GOING TO BE

13:10.750 --> 13:12.679
ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL AND HOW I

13:12.680 --> 13:15.249
HATE HER.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.079
>> BUT HE'S NEVER SHOWN HIS FACE

13:18.080 --> 13:18.480
ON CAMERA.

13:18.481 --> 13:21.349
>> BUT WITH THE BOYISH LESBIAN

13:21.350 --> 13:24.379
SHOW RUNNER DECIDED TO REBOOT

13:24.380 --> 13:25.819
SHEERA AS A BOYISH LESBIAN.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.619
>> WHO IS THIS EVIL MASTERMIND

13:27.620 --> 13:28.350
WHINING, COMPLAINING FROM THE

13:28.351 --> 13:38.879
SHADOWS?

13:38.880 --> 13:39.480
>> MEET RICHARD MYER.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.220
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE

13:40.220 --> 13:41.120
CURRENT STATE OF COMICS?

13:41.121 --> 13:44.979
>> COMICS ARE KIND OF WEIRDLY

13:44.980 --> 13:45.980
DYING.

13:45.980 --> 13:46.420
POLITICIANS.

13:46.421 --> 13:48.019
SPECIFICALLY IDENTITY POLITICS

13:48.020 --> 13:48.980
BEING SHOVED INTO EVERYTHING.

13:48.981 --> 13:50.179
THE CHARACTER THAT USED TO LOOK

13:50.180 --> 13:53.619
LIKE A 1980s DALLAS COWBOYS

13:53.620 --> 13:54.819
CHEERLEADER, BASICALLY LOOKS

13:54.820 --> 13:55.879
LIKE ME NOW.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.979
>> ROCKING THOSE A-CUPS.

13:58.980 --> 14:02.019
ANYTHING ABOVE A B-CUP, YOU HATE

14:02.020 --> 14:02.350
WOMEN.

14:02.351 --> 14:03.979
>> MS. MARVEL WAS INTRODUCED AS

14:03.980 --> 14:07.479
A PAKISTANI-AMERICAN MUSLIM.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.719
RIRI WILLIAMS, WHO REPLACED IRON

14:08.720 --> 14:09.020
MAN.

14:09.021 --> 14:10.779
IF YOU DON'T LIKE HER, IT'S

14:10.780 --> 14:12.879
BECAUSE YOU'RE RACIST, SEXIST,

14:12.880 --> 14:13.350
PROBABLY BOTH.

14:13.350 --> 14:14.220
>> IT WOULD UPSET A RACIST.

14:14.221 --> 14:20.149
>> I THINK IT WOULD.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.619
>> MYER SAYS ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS

14:21.620 --> 14:24.849
THESE CHANGES IS A SJW, SOCIAL

14:24.850 --> 14:25.680
JUSTICE WARRIOR.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.380
>> BLACK IS YOUR SHIELD.

14:26.381 --> 14:28.979
WOMAN IS YOUR SWORD.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.179
>> I DON'T KNOW,

14:31.180 --> 14:36.219
SWORDS, SHIELDS, IT'S ALL CHILD

14:36.220 --> 14:36.620
CHILDISH.

14:36.620 --> 14:37.380
IT WAS TIME TO BRING ADULTS INTO

14:37.381 --> 14:40.819
THE CONVERSATION.

14:40.820 --> 14:42.349
I ASSEMBLED AN ELITE TEAM OF

14:42.350 --> 14:46.119
PROUD SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIORS.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.979
LOKI.

14:48.980 --> 14:54.579
MEDUSA.

14:54.580 --> 14:55.719
>> DYKE.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.119
>> FANTASY ROLE PLAYERS FROM

14:57.120 --> 14:59.719
"THE KING OF QUEENS" I ASSUME?

14:59.720 --> 15:02.319
>> RICHARD MEYERS, HE BELIEVES

15:02.320 --> 15:03.979
THAT DIVERSITY IS RUINING THE

15:03.980 --> 15:05.049
COMIC BOOK INDUSTRY.

15:05.050 --> 15:05.550
>> THAT'S BULL.

15:05.550 --> 15:06.080
>> YEAH.

15:06.080 --> 15:06.980
>> THAT'S BULL.

15:06.981 --> 15:08.979
>> HE'S NOT BEEN READING COMICS.

15:08.980 --> 15:10.079
>> WHY DO YOU THINK SOME PEOPLE

15:10.080 --> 15:11.779
CAN BE SO POSSESSIVE OF COMIC

15:11.780 --> 15:12.520
BOOK CHARACTERS?

15:12.521 --> 15:13.979
>> I THINK ONCE YOU MAKE A

15:13.980 --> 15:14.850
CONNECTION WITH A CHARACTER THAT

15:14.851 --> 15:17.679
YOU LIKE A LOT, IT CREATES THIS

15:17.680 --> 15:18.650
SENSE OF OWNERSHIP.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.319
>> IF YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE

15:21.320 --> 15:22.619
CHARACTER, IT BOOSTS YOUR

15:22.620 --> 15:23.050
CONFIDENCE.

15:23.050 --> 15:23.980
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SO

15:23.980 --> 15:24.520
ALONE IN THE WORLD.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.280
>> THERE'S BEEN A REDUCTION OF

15:25.281 --> 15:28.279
BREASTS.

15:28.280 --> 15:28.680
>> YES.

15:28.681 --> 15:29.779
>> YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS

15:29.780 --> 15:30.220
CONTROVERSY?

15:30.221 --> 15:33.419
>> WE DON'T WANT TO OVERLY

15:33.420 --> 15:34.619
OBJECTIFY JUST TO SATISFY

15:34.620 --> 15:38.049
SOMEONE'S WEIRD FANTASY.

15:38.050 --> 15:41.119
>> WHAT ABOUT LIKE SUPERMAN HAD

15:41.120 --> 15:41.720
A DAD BOD?

15:41.721 --> 15:43.079
I HAVE THE POWER -- OVER THE

15:43.080 --> 15:46.019
TEMPERATURE IN THIS HOUSE!

15:46.020 --> 15:48.649
DO YOU THINK POLITICS CAN GET IN

15:48.650 --> 15:49.320
THE WAY?

15:49.321 --> 15:50.649
CAN'T WE HAVE A FUN STORY ABOUT

15:50.650 --> 15:51.620
A SUPERHERO --

15:51.621 --> 15:53.619
>> THE THING WITH COMICS IS

15:53.620 --> 15:55.019
THEY'VE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE

15:55.020 --> 15:56.249
TRENDS OF THE POLITICAL

15:56.250 --> 15:56.850
LANDSCAPE.

15:56.850 --> 15:57.720
SUPERMAN, HIS WHOLE THING IS

15:57.721 --> 16:00.079
HE'S AN ALIEN ON A COMPLETELY

16:00.080 --> 16:01.579
DIFFERENT PLANET AND HAS ADOPTED

16:01.580 --> 16:03.179
THE COUNTRY, AMERICA, AS HIS

16:03.180 --> 16:04.080
HOME AND IS TRYING TO FIT IN.

16:04.081 --> 16:07.849
THAT IS THE WHOLE ETHOS.

16:07.850 --> 16:12.419
>> I MIGHT BE SUPERMAN.

16:12.420 --> 16:16.049
MY SJWs ARE MAKING GOOD POINTS

16:16.050 --> 16:17.219
BUT I LIKE COMMON GROUND.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.579
MAYBE WE NEED CHARACTERS WITH

16:18.580 --> 16:20.479
TRAITS THAT APPEAL TO BOTH

16:20.480 --> 16:20.820
SIDES.

16:20.821 --> 16:23.249
I BROUGHT A FEW IDEAS.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.379
OKAY.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.679
BATMAN, BUT HE'S LATINO AND HE

16:25.680 --> 16:29.349
ONLY PROTECTS GATED COMMUNITIES.

16:29.350 --> 16:30.749
>> BAT ZIMMERMAN.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.080
>> OH.

16:31.080 --> 16:31.420
>> NO?

16:31.421 --> 16:34.379
OKAY.

16:34.380 --> 16:35.679
OKAY.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.149
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BLACK

16:38.150 --> 16:38.550
SUPERMAN?

16:38.550 --> 16:38.880
OKAY.

16:38.881 --> 16:41.049
A SLIGHTLY LESS BLACK SUPERMAN?

16:41.050 --> 16:43.179
>> YEAH, NO, THAT'S ACTUALLY

16:43.180 --> 16:43.550
BETTER.

16:43.551 --> 16:48.019
>> BLACK PANTHER'S VILLAIN,

16:48.020 --> 16:48.780
KILLMONGER, BUT NOW PLAYED BY A

16:48.781 --> 16:51.449
WOMAN.

16:51.450 --> 16:53.149
AND THE WAY THAT SHE ATTACKS THE

16:53.150 --> 16:55.819
BLACK PANTHER IS BY CALLING THE

16:55.820 --> 16:56.480
COPS WHILE HE'S TRYING TO

16:56.481 --> 17:03.149
BARBECUE.

17:03.150 --> 17:05.449
>> I'M OKAY WITH THIS ONE.

17:05.450 --> 17:07.449
>> PERMITMONGER.

17:07.450 --> 17:10.979
>> WE'VE FOUND ONE, WE'VE FOUND

17:10.980 --> 17:11.280
ONE.

17:11.280 --> 17:11.680
ALL RIGHT.

17:11.681 --> 17:13.479
THAT MIGHT FIX THE CHARACTERS.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.479
MY GROUP AREN'T JUST FIGHTING

17:15.480 --> 17:17.319
WHAT'S IN COMIC BOOKS, THEY'RE

17:17.319 --> 17:18.749
ALSO ATTACKING WOMEN AND PEOPLE

17:18.750 --> 17:20.549
OF COLOR WHO MAKE COMIC BOOKS.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.249
>> THEY'RE HIRING PEOPLE FOR THE

17:23.250 --> 17:23.750
BUZZFEED.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.848
LOOK, WE HIRED THIS OVERWEIGHT

17:24.849 --> 17:27.479
BLACK WOMAN.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.879
ISN'T THAT EXCITING.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.119
>> YOU HAVE SAID THAT SOME WOMEN

17:31.120 --> 17:32.519
ARE SLEEPING THEIR WAY TO GET

17:32.520 --> 17:33.320
INTO THESE POSITIONS?

17:33.321 --> 17:35.419
>> SO I DID ONE VIDEO, IT'S A

17:35.420 --> 17:37.049
COMMON THING FOR MY ENEMIES TO

17:37.050 --> 17:38.679
BRING UP.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.279
LITERALLY SUCKED HER

17:40.280 --> 17:43.979
WAY INTO THE COMIC INDUSTRY.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.719
IS A

17:45.720 --> 17:46.120
DUMPSTER.

17:46.121 --> 17:47.279
>> HE CALLED A WOMAN A

17:47.280 --> 17:47.680
DUMPSTER.

17:47.681 --> 17:53.679
>> YEAH.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.250
>> THAT'S NOT GOOD.

17:54.251 --> 17:56.079
>> YEAH, IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.449
>> EVEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE

17:59.450 --> 18:02.349
THAT YOU'RE A RACIST OR

18:02.350 --> 18:04.779
HOMOPHOBIC OR SEXIST, IS IT A

18:04.780 --> 18:06.319
FEAR OF YOURS THAT YOU ARE

18:06.320 --> 18:07.280
ATTRACTING SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE?

18:07.281 --> 18:08.449
>> I DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT

18:08.450 --> 18:09.120
STUFF LIKE THAT THAT MUCH.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.519
>> RIGHT.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.849
SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT WANT TO

18:12.850 --> 18:14.319
START THINKING ABOUT IT,

18:14.320 --> 18:14.680
RICHARD.

18:14.680 --> 18:15.420
OTHER PEOPLE ARE.

18:15.421 --> 18:17.219
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RICHARD

18:17.220 --> 18:17.580
MEYERS?

18:17.581 --> 18:19.519
>> HE'S A GARBAGE PERSON.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.979
>> HE'S A -- YOU CAN SAY

18:20.980 --> 18:21.550
ON THIS SHOW.

18:21.551 --> 18:23.549
>> OH.

18:23.550 --> 18:26.479
>> LOOK, CLEARLY RICHARD'S

18:26.480 --> 18:26.820
UPSET.

18:26.821 --> 18:28.249
HE CAN NO LONGER PICK UP ANY

18:28.250 --> 18:29.519
COMIC BOOK AND INSTANTLY RELATE

18:29.520 --> 18:30.719
TO THE CHARACTERS HE SEES.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.149
AND THAT'S A REAL FEELING.

18:32.150 --> 18:33.349
BECAUSE IT'S HOW WOMEN AND

18:33.350 --> 18:34.120
MINORITY GROUPS HAVE FELT THEIR

18:34.121 --> 18:37.479
ENTIRE LIVES.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.619
WAKE THE  UP, RICHARD.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.119
THE CHARACTERS YOU DON'T LIKE

18:41.120 --> 18:42.479
AREN'T WRITTEN FOR YOU.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.380
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:43.380 --> 18:44.150
I THINK I LIKE THIS BETTER HOW

18:44.151 --> 18:49.379
WE STARTED.

18:49.380 --> 18:51.850
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.349
>>> THAT'S OUR SHOW.

19:00.350 --> 19:04.179
BEFORE WE GO, AS I SAID EARLIER,

19:04.180 --> 19:05.979
I  LOVE CHICK-FIL-A.

19:05.980 --> 19:07.979
SO MUCH I'M WILLING TO OVERLOOK

19:07.980 --> 19:10.819
THEIR QUESTIONABLE CORPORATE

19:10.820 --> 19:11.180
ETHICS.

19:11.181 --> 19:12.519
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN IN

19:12.520 --> 19:14.119
CHICK-FIL-A LAST WEEK THAT EVEN

19:14.120 --> 19:15.979
I CAN'T CONDONE.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.179
>> AN EXPECTANT COUPLE HAD

19:17.180 --> 19:18.979
PLANNED THEIR BABY'S BIRTH FOR

19:18.980 --> 19:19.320
MONTHS.

19:19.321 --> 19:20.649
BUT NO BIRTH PLAN COULD HAVE

19:20.650 --> 19:22.249
PREPARED THEM FOR HOW THEIR BABY

19:22.250 --> 19:23.779
WOULD ACTUALLY ENTER THE WORLD.

19:23.780 --> 19:25.449
>> I REALIZED, OH MY GOSH, THIS

19:25.450 --> 19:27.019
IS HAPPENING, I'M GOING TO GIVE

19:27.020 --> 19:29.719
BIRTH IN THIS CHICK-FIL-A

19:29.720 --> 19:30.120
BATHROOM.

19:30.120 --> 19:30.880
>> WHY DID THEY HAVE TO USE THE

19:30.881 --> 19:33.449
BATHROOM?

19:33.450 --> 19:35.279
THEY COULD HAVE USED ANYWHERE.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.379
THEY COULD HAVE PUT HER ON ONE

19:36.380 --> 19:37.979
OF THE TABLES, PUT HER ON THE

19:37.980 --> 19:39.619
COUNTER WOULD HAVE WORKED,

19:39.620 --> 19:39.980
RIGHT?

19:39.981 --> 19:41.379
THEN SHE COULD HAVE SHAT THE

19:41.380 --> 19:43.549
BABY OUT INTO A TO-GO BOX.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.049
OR ARE THE HUSBAND COULD BE

19:45.050 --> 19:46.379
WAITING WITH TWO CHICK-FIL-A

19:46.380 --> 19:47.150
BUNS AND CAUGHT IT LIKE A WICKET

19:47.151 --> 19:54.649
KEEPER FROM CRICKET.

19:54.650 --> 19:55.719
THE FATHER LATER SAID THAT HE

19:55.720 --> 19:57.249
THOUGHT IT WAS IRONIC FOR A

19:57.250 --> 19:58.719
CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE FAMILY TO

19:58.720 --> 19:59.779
HAVE A CHILD IN A FAST FOOD

19:59.780 --> 20:00.220
RESTAURANT.

20:00.221 --> 20:02.979
REALLY?

20:02.980 --> 20:03.650
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK IS

20:03.651 --> 20:06.219
IRONIC?

20:06.220 --> 20:09.079
I GUESS IT'S LIKE THAT ALANIS

20:09.080 --> 20:13.049
MORISSETTE SONG, "YOU OUGHT THAT

20:13.050 --> 20:13.750
KNOW."

20:13.751 --> 20:16.179
YOU OUGHTA KNOW THAT'S NOT HOW

20:16.180 --> 20:16.980
IRONY WORKS.

20:16.981 --> 20:18.919
A CHICK-FIL-A BABY IS EXACTLY

20:18.920 --> 20:20.179
WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTS.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.779
EVERY TIME I SEE SOMEONE IN A

20:21.780 --> 20:22.849
TRUMP SHIRT I'M ALWAYS LIKE,

20:22.850 --> 20:24.719
THAT PERSON WAS EITHER BORN OR

20:24.720 --> 20:25.480
CONCEIVED IN THE BATHROOM OF A

20:25.481 --> 20:29.949
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.

20:29.950 --> 20:32.049
I'M GLAD EVERYONE'S OKAY.

20:32.050 --> 20:33.249
BUT I CAN'T HELP FEELING BAD FOR

20:33.250 --> 20:34.319
THE BABY.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.819
BECAUSE IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM

20:35.820 --> 20:36.150
HERE.

20:36.151 --> 20:39.249
>> AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT,

20:39.250 --> 20:40.919
CHICK-FIL-A IS GIVING GRACEN

20:40.920 --> 20:42.949
FREE CHICK-FIL-A FOR LIFE AND

20:42.950 --> 20:45.349
GUARANTEED HER A JOB WHEN SHE

20:45.350 --> 20:45.750
TURNS 16.

20:45.751 --> 20:46.879
>> FREE FOOD FOR LIFE AND A JOB

20:46.880 --> 20:48.519
AT 16, HOW GENEROUS.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.719
I GUESS THE DIABETES IS JUST A

20:52.720 --> 20:53.050
BONUS.

20:53.050 --> 20:53.980
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

20:53.981 --> 20:56.919
I'M JIM JEFFERIES.

20:56.920 --> 20:57.650
I THINK WE CAN ALL DO BETTER.

20:57.651 --> 21:03.980
GOOD NIGHT.

21:08.350 --> 21:18.449
DUMPSTER?

21:18.450 --> 21:21.519

21:21.520 --> 21:21.880

21:21.880 --> 21:22.850
