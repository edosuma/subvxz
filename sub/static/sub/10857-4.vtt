00:11.936 --> 00:13.433
Hey, Matt.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.190
Is it true you've ordered
non-lethal weapons?

00:17.535 --> 00:18.834
Morning, Becker.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.569
Jess, so...

00:21.570 --> 00:23.588
- Three extra shelves.
- Yeah.

00:23.589 --> 00:24.797
I got a lot of plants.

00:25.107 --> 00:28.223
The team needs real guns, we're not
collecting for petting zoo.

00:28.224 --> 00:31.218
These creatures aren't just interesting,
they're also deadly.

00:31.512 --> 00:32.918
Yeah, I know.

00:32.919 --> 00:35.237
So, you know what happens
when they cut corners.

00:35.584 --> 00:38.134
People get hurt.
People die.

00:38.350 --> 00:41.775
Why don't you just give the new weapons a
chance? You might be pleasantly surprised.

00:42.970 --> 00:44.033
Jess.

00:44.270 --> 00:47.389
Yeah, lots of shelves,
lots of plants, I got it.

00:49.042 --> 00:50.816
I'll see you both
at the meeting.

00:56.579 --> 00:58.393
He's got no idea.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.238
I don't know.
I think he's alright?

01:00.239 --> 01:01.930
Yeah, but I don't trust him.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.146
And you'll see, the rest of
the team won't either.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.152
Okay, guys. For those of you
who I've not met properly.

01:08.153 --> 01:11.541
My name is Matt Anderson. I'm your
new team leader. For the last...

01:11.542 --> 01:14.800
...couple of days your steamed
colleague Captain Becker has been...

01:14.810 --> 01:17.900
...banding my ear on
every detail of this operation.

01:17.901 --> 01:19.463
To insure...

01:19.464 --> 01:21.620
...that you properly lived after?

01:21.621 --> 01:24.281
So I would like to assure
you that safety...

01:24.282 --> 01:25.674
...the safety of this entire team...

01:25.675 --> 01:29.852
...even the safety of Captain
Becker is my number one priority.

01:30.310 --> 01:32.852
Your jobs are demanding.

01:32.853 --> 01:34.937
Your jobs are dangerous.

01:34.938 --> 01:39.150
You put your lives on the line to protect
the public every time that alarm goes off.

01:39.151 --> 01:40.907
There's no room for errors.

01:40.908 --> 01:44.065
There's no time for on the job training.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.064
So with all of that in mind,

01:46.065 --> 01:49.576
some new policy changes
are being implemented.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.999
All new field operatives
will be strictly military...

01:53.439 --> 01:55.414
...or from the military background.

01:55.718 --> 01:57.943
Safety will come first.

01:57.944 --> 02:00.550
There will be no more
civilian recruiting.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.428
If anyone wants to talk about this,
my door is always open.

02:06.859 --> 02:08.598
Over the last few months,

02:08.830 --> 02:12.669
a lot of you've testified to the
last mission of the old ARC.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.567
Yesterday...

02:14.568 --> 02:16.985
...that investigation was
officially wrapped up.

02:19.170 --> 02:22.751
Abby Maitland, Connor Temple
and Danny Quinn...

02:23.600 --> 02:25.838
...have been pronounced missing...

02:26.180 --> 02:27.726
...presumed dead.

02:28.210 --> 02:32.463
I would like to make it clear today
that this means absolutely nothing.

02:32.775 --> 02:36.280
Over the years, this organization has
lost many brilliant people...

02:36.285 --> 02:40.261
...including Nick Cutter, Stephen Hart,
most recently Sarah Page...

02:40.829 --> 02:44.323
As far as I'm concerned,
this does not include Abby Maitland,

02:44.650 --> 02:47.300
Connor Temple
and Danny Quinn.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.038
These people could still be out
there, fighting to stay alive,

02:50.039 --> 02:51.718
fighting to make it home.

02:52.738 --> 02:55.259
I didn't have the chance to work
with them all as you did.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.250
But I hope that someday I will.

02:57.251 --> 03:01.634
So today as you new team leader, I'm
rejecting the government's findings.

03:01.875 --> 03:04.414
- See? Told you.
- We're not giving up on these guys.

03:04.415 --> 03:05.699
Not yet.
