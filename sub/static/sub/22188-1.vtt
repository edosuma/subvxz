WEBVTT

01:10.500 --> 01:12.500
Back then...

01:14.333 --> 01:16.542
Before the Japanese took South China...

01:16.625 --> 01:19.917
Our team captain, Zeng Sheng...

01:20.958 --> 01:24.292
He... was in Dongguan.

01:25.458 --> 01:29.750
He was sending guerrillas to Hong Kong.

01:31.833 --> 01:35.542
Their first mission was to rescue...

01:37.333 --> 01:40.917
...scholars and intellectuals
who had fled occupied China.

01:41.625 --> 01:45.792
Many were stranded in Hong Kong
when it fell to Japan.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.792
He co-ordinated their rescue.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.917
This is an emergency mission.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.583
We've established two escape routes.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.333
The intellectuals have been grouped by age.

02:01.417 --> 02:04.417
And by their fitness and their recognizability.

02:06.625 --> 02:07.792
The eastern route...

02:07.875 --> 02:11.333
...runs from Ngau Chi Wan and Sai Kung...

02:11.417 --> 02:14.917
...Mires Bay, Da Meisha
and Xiao Meisha to White Sand Bay.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.500
The western route...

02:16.583 --> 02:17.792
...runs from Kowloon.

02:18.042 --> 02:20.042
It goes along Castle Peak Road
and Tsuen Wan...

02:20.125 --> 02:21.250
...through Tai Mo Shan...

02:21.333 --> 02:22.417
...and Yuen Long...

02:22.500 --> 02:23.875
...and along the Shenzhen River...

02:23.958 --> 02:25.042
...to Bao An.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.083
For their safety...

02:27.667 --> 02:28.833
Their transport...

02:29.542 --> 02:30.833
Their food and lodging...

02:31.292 --> 02:34.000
We all share responsibility.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.833
Who exactly are we rescuing?

02:38.917 --> 02:40.708
Agents from Nanjing...

02:40.792 --> 02:42.708
...are bringing a list of names...

02:42.792 --> 02:45.167
...to Wong Kau-Tin, the godfather of Kowloon.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.083
He will hand it over to the Japanese.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.708
We plan to intercept that list.

02:50.958 --> 02:52.708
Why would Nanjing do that?

02:53.875 --> 02:55.833
They'll get benefits in return.

02:56.292 --> 02:57.625
The bastards!

02:58.958 --> 03:01.208
This mission will be dangerous.

03:01.292 --> 03:03.250
And expensive.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.583
Our orders from above are to make sure...

03:07.500 --> 03:09.042
...that the evacuees get...

03:09.125 --> 03:13.000
...two meals a day...

03:13.083 --> 03:14.333
...and a tael of oil.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.042
Our own daily rations...

03:16.125 --> 03:19.167
...will be cut to 75 cents.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.000
And half a tael of oil.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.417
These days Hong Kong is full of bandits.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.208
The overland route will cross their turf.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.292
For example,
the route goes through Tai Mo Shan...

03:30.375 --> 03:33.167
...which is controlled
by Siu Tin-Loi and Big Eyeballs.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.583
If we aren't careful...

03:36.667 --> 03:38.292
...someone might die.

03:39.083 --> 03:40.417
Brother Tsang...

03:40.500 --> 03:42.708
You control Meizhou.

03:42.792 --> 03:46.125
We'll need you to exercise your influence now.

03:47.708 --> 03:49.000
For sure.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.125
Respected gentlemen...

04:15.042 --> 04:16.541
I am Blackie Lau.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.708
Brother Tsang has asked you to meet us...

04:18.791 --> 04:21.708
...because we have a favor to ask of you.

04:21.791 --> 04:24.375
Does Tsang's influence now cover our turf too?

04:24.458 --> 04:26.125
He should respect the limits!

04:27.167 --> 04:28.542
We know the rules.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.500
But we need safe passage.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.583
We just need to pass through your area.

04:32.667 --> 04:33.875
Nothing else will change.

04:33.958 --> 04:35.125
Safe passage?

04:35.208 --> 04:36.917
We've never granted that, have we?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.250
Never!

04:41.708 --> 04:43.417
You don't trust Brother Tsang?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.417
Who'll pay the protection money?

04:47.875 --> 04:50.542
There's a war on, brother! We're poor too.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.083
We do have men of our own, just a few.

05:03.833 --> 05:04.917
I can do him this favor.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.542
I'll expect a return favor one day.

05:06.792 --> 05:09.042
On behalf of Brother Tsang, I thank you.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.625
"1942 OCCUPIED
HONG KONG"

06:15.125 --> 06:16.583
Mrs Shen!

06:17.458 --> 06:18.375
Mrs Shen!

06:18.458 --> 06:20.125
I'll do it, let me

06:20.333 --> 06:21.375
Thank you.

06:23.958 --> 06:25.417
What are these?

06:25.500 --> 06:26.833
A kind of biscuit.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.333
Have some water, Mr Shen.

06:29.417 --> 06:30.417
Thank you.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.875
Let me...

06:36.417 --> 06:41.833
Finding a room to rent
is hard these days, Mrs Shen.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.958
My uncle has just rented a room.

06:46.042 --> 06:50.375
And gangsters
are always asking for protection money!

06:50.792 --> 06:53.417
He can hardly sleep, he's so scared.

06:54.167 --> 06:56.167
We're like family!

06:56.250 --> 06:59.125
I charge less rent than anyone around here.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.917
I know, Mrs Fong, that's not why...

07:02.000 --> 07:03.208
We're very comfortable here.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.042
We really don't want to leave.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.500
But...

07:11.167 --> 07:14.875
There's no food, no fuel,
sometimes not even water.

07:14.958 --> 07:16.250
Mr Shen is in poor health.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.708
I can't manage on my own.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.458
If we stay with our friends...

07:20.542 --> 07:21.625
...we can share the burden...

07:21.708 --> 07:23.167
...and help each other.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.125
We won't need to bother you any more.

07:25.208 --> 07:26.750
I won't hear of it!

07:28.292 --> 07:29.500
Well.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.333
We're family here.

07:31.417 --> 07:35.000
Don't worry about next month's rent.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.333
I won't charge interest if you pay it late.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.667
The rent isn't the problem, Mrs Fong.

07:41.292 --> 07:42.833
We really have to move.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.458
Please do reconsider.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.000
Do reconsider.

07:50.167 --> 07:52.375
You don't want the biscuits?

07:52.750 --> 07:54.042
I'll put them away.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.792
Do reconsider.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.333
Thank you.

08:04.542 --> 08:05.875
Nobody must know...

08:05.958 --> 08:08.375
...that we're leaving.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.042
My little bunny...

09:14.458 --> 09:16.250
...let's find you some grass.

09:22.208 --> 09:25.000
You go back to the wild, okay?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.333
When your mother finds out you've let it go...

09:38.417 --> 09:39.875
...she'll be furious.

09:41.292 --> 09:43.792
We're starving anyway, it makes no difference.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.042
But rabbit stew is so delicious!

09:46.292 --> 09:47.417
Lee Gam-Wing!

09:47.875 --> 09:49.667
If we only had some butter...

09:49.750 --> 09:51.792
...I could make you some nice hors d'oeuvre.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.750
Escargot bourguignonne...

09:53.833 --> 09:55.417
And pan-fried...

09:55.500 --> 09:57.875
At a time like this,
you think about French cuisine?

09:57.958 --> 09:59.208
It's spouting foam...

09:59.292 --> 10:00.625
Let it go.

10:17.667 --> 10:19.208
Happy birthday.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.042
Make a wish.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.000
Without a candle?

10:26.083 --> 10:27.583
Needs must.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.542
Okay

10:38.542 --> 10:39.750
Thank you.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.333
Cake...

11:14.125 --> 11:15.583
Let's get married.

11:16.542 --> 11:20.000
Have the ceremony, throw a small banquet.

11:21.583 --> 11:22.917
Then, for as long as we live...

11:23.750 --> 11:25.833
...I'll cook for you every day.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.792
Why get married now?

11:36.875 --> 11:39.708
I'm happy just to be alive.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.375
I have to go.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.625
The school's closed.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.000
My relatives have gone back to China.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.583
Where are you going?

12:07.042 --> 12:09.500
Lee Gam-Wing, what are you thinking?

12:09.792 --> 12:12.000
You just proposed marriage
and now you're leaving?

12:12.750 --> 12:14.500
If you accept me...

12:14.583 --> 12:16.250
...we can have the ceremony first.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.875
You can stay with your mother for now,
or move to China...

12:19.958 --> 12:21.875
...with her, and I'll join you later.

12:21.958 --> 12:25.125
What's the point of marrying if you're leaving?

12:25.208 --> 12:28.375
Leave if you want, why worry about marriage?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.125
I'm not worried...

12:32.208 --> 12:34.125
...maybe just impulsive.

12:36.292 --> 12:38.625
Then think before you speak!

12:47.417 --> 12:49.458
(Japanese) The new year brings a new dawn.

12:49.542 --> 12:52.875
Guided by His Highness the Emperor,
in this auspicious year of 2602...

12:53.375 --> 12:56.417
...our imperial army shakes the continent.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.875
All the way to the south.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.417
The parade is over.

13:01.500 --> 13:05.458
General Nakamura Kotaro signals with his sword.

13:05.917 --> 13:08.167
The 20,000 hand-picked men
stationed in the capital...

13:08.250 --> 13:12.542
...led by the infantry...

13:12.625 --> 13:16.083
...march in time with the martial music.

13:17.208 --> 13:20.083
On his steed Snow, His Highness...

13:20.917 --> 13:24.875
...sends them off with a solemn wave.

13:25.792 --> 13:28.667
To die for the Emperor! No turning back!

13:28.750 --> 13:32.208
Our indomitably loyal troops...

13:36.500 --> 13:38.958
The Imperial Army of Japan invites...

13:39.042 --> 13:42.292
Mr Mao Dun, Mr Zou Taofen...

13:42.375 --> 13:44.167
Mr Mei Lanfang...

13:44.250 --> 13:47.500
Mr Situ Huimin and Mr Xia Yan...

13:47.583 --> 13:51.458
...to attend an important meeting
at the Peninsula Hotel.

13:52.083 --> 13:55.167
It's chaotic, everyone wants to leave.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.458
And there's always someone trying to make money.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.792
If you run into gangsters...

14:06.333 --> 14:08.458
...they'll take your life and your money!

14:09.500 --> 14:12.083
Traitors merely turn you in.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.833
We can't run around looking for a way out.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Find someone trustworthy to help.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.708
Stay indoors, if there's any news...

14:22.792 --> 14:24.458
...my wife will let you know.

14:25.667 --> 14:26.917
Try to stay inconspicuous.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.208
Let's go separately, stick to the back-streets.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.458
Mr Shen...

15:10.250 --> 15:11.833
Mr Shen is here!

15:12.167 --> 15:13.750
Your books have arrived.

15:14.375 --> 15:15.667
Thank you, Mr Tang.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.750
The escape plan is here.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.750
Write down the place where you're staying.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.083
Be specific.

15:31.667 --> 15:32.708
Take a seat.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.958
Don't go out tomorrow afternoon.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.625
Someone will come to pick up you and your wife.

15:44.958 --> 15:46.208
Zou Taofen will be with us too.

15:46.292 --> 15:47.292
Yes.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.000
I don't know the person picking us up!

15:50.083 --> 15:52.125
Easy, there's a code.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.458
Follow the code and there'll be no problem.

15:54.708 --> 15:55.792
The code is...

15:56.000 --> 15:57.333
"Where's the man from Jiangxi?"

15:57.417 --> 15:59.083
And the answer: "At my place."

16:00.208 --> 16:02.542
Carry as little as you can.

16:02.833 --> 16:04.792
It's far, and there'll be no porter.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.083
You can't go in those clothes.

16:11.542 --> 16:12.083
Hey, you.

16:12.167 --> 16:14.250
Swap your clothes with Mr Shen.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.167
Leave the hat too.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.625
"The wind which carried the rays
of the setting sun has died down."

16:39.417 --> 16:41.708
"It's as if it melted away."

16:43.083 --> 16:45.792
"The gleaming crests
of countless waves in the sea..."

16:45.875 --> 16:48.958
"...have flattened into a dull green mass."

16:50.625 --> 16:53.042
"From far, comes the solemn sound of a bugle."

16:54.208 --> 16:58.125
"Night's black curtain is falling,
but glimmers of light remain."

16:59.708 --> 17:02.583
"The wind which seemed
to have whispered its last..."

17:02.750 --> 17:04.375
"...is suddenly back."

17:05.500 --> 17:08.125
"Now it sounds like a muffled drum."

17:08.625 --> 17:10.916
"Boom - lun - lun, boom - lun - lun."

17:11.208 --> 17:16.666
"No, not merely
the sound of the wind but thunder!"

17:16.958 --> 17:18.916
"The wind carries the voice of thunder!"

17:19.708 --> 17:23.625
"The sea roils, the waves surge high!"

17:24.166 --> 17:26.708
"Crash! Crash!"

17:28.458 --> 17:32.042
"Into the sea's dark night, a storm has burst."

17:38.667 --> 17:40.250
You know it by heart!

17:41.792 --> 17:44.792
I've loved your work since I was a student.

17:45.292 --> 17:47.333
Now I introduce it to my students.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.750
How old are they?

17:48.833 --> 17:50.083
Primary four.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.792
Do they understand it?

17:52.875 --> 17:54.208
Yes, they do.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.917
Mother says that you're leaving.

18:07.333 --> 18:11.750
I never dreamed we'd be under the same roof.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.583
Is it inconvenient here? Or too expensive?

18:17.958 --> 18:21.500
No... nothing like that.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.500
Mrs Shen.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.875
Mrs Fong.

19:14.792 --> 19:18.250
Lan dear, bring Mrs Shen's flask to fill.

19:18.417 --> 19:19.500
All right.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.417
Hello, Mrs Shen.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.250
Hello, Miss Fong.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.458
I'll bring some fresh water.

19:32.167 --> 19:33.167
Where have you been?

19:33.250 --> 19:35.458
Picking up some things for the journey.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.625
It's chaotic out there.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.667
Go and fetch Zou...

19:40.750 --> 19:42.167
...he might not find this place.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.000
Who are you looking for?

20:10.625 --> 20:11.750
Someone.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.333
By the name of ...?

20:13.542 --> 20:14.833
Shen.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.833
Mr Mao Dun (pen name)?

20:34.875 --> 20:36.875
- You are ...?
- Yes.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.125
Ready to go?

20:41.083 --> 20:42.708
Try not to bring too much.

20:42.792 --> 20:45.333
It's a long way, you should travel light.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.708
Take your time, I'll wait.

20:47.792 --> 20:49.292
No rush.

20:53.042 --> 20:54.292
Mrs Shen...

20:54.417 --> 20:55.792
Hello...

20:56.000 --> 20:59.167
Someone I don't know is with your husband.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.292
Don't go in now, hide for a little while.

21:13.708 --> 21:16.250
We can go as soon as your wife gets back.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.875
We can take more people, you know.

21:19.917 --> 21:23.417
Is there anyone else nearby?

21:25.208 --> 21:27.958
Let me think...

21:31.917 --> 21:33.833
Well...

21:33.917 --> 21:36.083
Did Mr Tang mention to you...

21:36.167 --> 21:37.583
Where's the man from Jiangxi?

21:40.125 --> 21:41.792
Where's the man from Jiangxi?

21:41.958 --> 21:42.917
Ah...

21:43.000 --> 21:44.583
...the man from Jiangxi...

21:44.833 --> 21:46.542
Who's that?

21:57.375 --> 21:58.750
I remember you!

22:00.250 --> 22:01.625
That day at...

22:02.625 --> 22:04.917
Oh, I forget, don't you remember?

22:06.250 --> 22:07.708
Leung Yau Cafe!

22:07.792 --> 22:08.917
Leung Yau Cafe!

22:09.042 --> 22:09.917
I remember now!

22:10.000 --> 22:11.667
Remember? You ordered tea...

22:14.375 --> 22:16.667
Breathe!

22:23.500 --> 22:26.500
Breathe, it's normal to feel dizzy.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.500
Where's the man from Jiangxi?

22:33.500 --> 22:34.792
What...?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.667
Where's the man from Jiangxi?

22:40.125 --> 22:42.042
At my place.

22:43.875 --> 22:44.833
Good.

22:45.542 --> 22:46.542
Okay.

22:47.042 --> 22:48.000
Help me here.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.292
It's all right.

23:02.375 --> 23:03.500
My landlady.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.375
Hey!

23:19.458 --> 23:20.625
Lend a hand...

23:23.375 --> 23:24.958
Lend a hand here.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.875
Lan dear!

23:45.458 --> 23:46.667
Lan dear!

23:46.958 --> 23:50.125
I'm just going to the shop with auntie!

23:51.000 --> 23:52.250
Don't be long.

24:03.583 --> 24:04.958
What kept you?

24:05.042 --> 24:06.708
I told them to hide and wait.

24:06.792 --> 24:07.417
Mr Shen...

24:07.500 --> 24:09.333
I can't go with you but you can't stay here.

24:09.417 --> 24:12.917
Go to the Causeway Bay
typhoon shelter at sunset.

24:14.250 --> 24:14.833
I'll fetch my things.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.458
No time for that.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.417
How can we get there? We don't know the way.

24:20.833 --> 24:21.792
Landlady...

24:22.000 --> 24:25.333
Take them to the typhoon shelter at sunset.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.917
Someone will be waiting for them there.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.500
Hurry!

24:28.625 --> 24:30.750
There's no time now, hurry!

24:32.917 --> 24:34.458
What time exactly?

24:34.583 --> 24:35.792
7:00 pm.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.917
(Japanese) Hey, long time no see!

24:53.333 --> 24:54.375
How ya doing?

24:54.458 --> 24:55.875
You look well!

24:55.958 --> 24:57.625
Forgotten your old buddy?

24:57.708 --> 25:00.500
Look at me,
all I have is this lousy little gun.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.083
Hurry!

26:38.458 --> 26:39.625
Careful...

26:50.083 --> 26:51.500
Sorry.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.250
I couldn't tell anyone...

26:53.333 --> 26:55.125
...that I'm leaving Hong Kong, so...

26:55.208 --> 26:59.167
Not at all,
if Mr Mao Dun has a problem, I must help.

27:20.375 --> 27:21.667
Thank you.

27:23.292 --> 27:24.542
Goodbye, Mr Shen.

27:25.958 --> 27:27.083
See you after the victory.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.625
Thank you.

27:36.792 --> 27:37.792
Hello, everyone.

27:38.917 --> 27:40.250
Hello, everyone.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.583
Mr Liang.

27:43.625 --> 27:44.667
Hello.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.125
Mr Xia.

27:52.917 --> 27:54.208
Mr Cai.

27:54.458 --> 27:55.417
Mrs Cai.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.208
Hello, Mr Liu.

28:07.042 --> 28:08.083
Now I remember...

28:08.167 --> 28:10.000
...we stayed in a hostel...

28:10.083 --> 28:12.167
...which was half-commandeered by the Japanese.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.958
They were always running in and out,
up and down.

28:15.042 --> 28:17.917
They even barged in to watch us playing mahjong.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.417
And asked if they'd startled us!

28:20.958 --> 28:23.208
I heard they went for people in suits first...

28:23.292 --> 28:24.375
...so I put on Chinese clothes.

28:24.458 --> 28:27.042
Then I realized
they were nicer to people in suits...

28:27.125 --> 28:29.583
But by then I'd pawned my suit!

28:29.667 --> 28:30.875
And spent the money on rice!

28:33.000 --> 28:34.583
Rice has become a luxury nowadays.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.417
Of course...

28:49.125 --> 28:50.417
This looks all right.

28:52.667 --> 28:53.708
Not too bad.

28:53.792 --> 28:54.917
I'll try it on.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.875
Mr Shen's friend came to pick him up.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.417
He was sorry to leave in such a rush.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.625
They didn't even say goodbye.

30:24.792 --> 30:27.250
He paid a month's rent.
and stayed only five days

30:27.333 --> 30:29.375
We did well out of it!

30:29.792 --> 30:32.750
Mrs Shen said
she left some canned food and rice.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.625
We have meat today!

30:50.708 --> 30:51.708
Of course.

30:51.958 --> 30:53.625
I got some army money.

30:53.750 --> 30:55.958
Pork costs more than gold these days!

30:57.458 --> 30:59.125
Isn't Gam-Wing coming to eat with us?

30:59.875 --> 31:01.458
No, he has work at the school.

31:01.542 --> 31:02.625
He's busy?

31:02.708 --> 31:04.750
The school is closed.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.250
Let's wait for a while.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.125
Monsters!

31:18.208 --> 31:19.750
Snatching girls again!

31:21.042 --> 31:22.333
Monsters!

31:29.292 --> 31:30.583
Dinner time!

31:32.917 --> 31:34.333
Please eat!

31:35.250 --> 31:36.167
Eat first...

31:36.250 --> 31:37.625
...then take a rest.

31:37.708 --> 31:41.375
At dawn, we'll cross the harbor in small groups

33:06.792 --> 33:08.792
When you disembark, head for Shanghai Street

33:08.875 --> 33:11.792
Follow the crowds
who are returning to the mainland.

33:11.875 --> 33:13.667
You'll see a man with an umbrella.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.542
He'll show you the way.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.917
Mr Shen, you must be exhausted.

34:58.000 --> 34:58.917
Mrs Shen.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.542
This is Brother Tsang.

35:00.667 --> 35:01.583
Hello, Brother Tsang.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.917
Mr Shen, Mrs Shen.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.250
You must all be tired.

35:04.917 --> 35:07.917
Beyond this mountain is unoccupied territory.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.958
Let's be on our way!

35:11.292 --> 35:12.167
Please!

35:12.583 --> 35:14.417
"We are snipers."

35:14.500 --> 35:17.042
"One bullet for each enemy."

35:17.125 --> 35:19.042
"We are invincible,"

35:19.042 --> 35:21.417
"braving mountains and sea."

35:21.500 --> 35:23.375
"The forest thickets..."

35:23.458 --> 35:25.833
"...bristle with the camps of our comrades."

35:25.917 --> 35:27.667
"And the mountain peaks..."

35:27.750 --> 35:30.292
"...lined with our unbeatable forces."

35:31.458 --> 35:35.917
"THIS TIME, MORE THAN 800 INTELLECTUALS
WERE SAFELY EVACUATED FROM HONG KONG."

35:42.750 --> 35:45.083
Fong Lan?

35:45.750 --> 35:48.750
Fong Lan taught me
in primary school... "Miss Fong."

35:54.333 --> 35:56.917
Blackie Lau? Yes, I knew him.

35:57.250 --> 36:02.500
He was very mischievous.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.083
But very capable...

36:04.542 --> 36:06.417
I first saw him in a cafe.

36:06.500 --> 36:11.500
Didn't know who he was.

36:12.958 --> 36:16.750
Back then,
we were only told what we needed to know.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.917
We just knew whose orders to follow.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.417
Didn't know which ones were guerrilla fighters.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.583
We didn't know.

36:47.625 --> 36:48.708
I almost forgot!

36:50.250 --> 36:51.542
And it's really important!

36:51.625 --> 36:52.417
You were supposed to remind me!

36:52.500 --> 36:53.875
Wait...

36:54.042 --> 36:55.417
We've gone too far.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.708
Didn't I...

36:56.792 --> 36:57.833
Didn't I say to remind me?

36:57.917 --> 36:59.458
What's wrong with you?

36:59.667 --> 37:00.958
Go fetch some water.

37:01.792 --> 37:03.167
I'll wash my face.

37:23.125 --> 37:25.000
Man Dam, give me a hand.

37:25.625 --> 37:26.208
What's that?

37:26.292 --> 37:27.333
Push them back in!

37:55.333 --> 37:56.292
What's this?

37:56.375 --> 37:57.958
My relative died.

37:58.750 --> 37:59.833
Let me see.

38:00.125 --> 38:01.708
He died of cholera.

38:03.333 --> 38:04.417
Unwrap it!

38:05.333 --> 38:07.167
Brother, it's infectious.

38:08.125 --> 38:09.708
I said unwrap it!

38:50.625 --> 38:51.417
A spy!

38:51.500 --> 38:53.542
Yeah, he almost got us.

38:53.833 --> 38:54.833
Is Leung Fook all right?

38:54.917 --> 38:55.875
He's fine.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.125
We'd better get moving.

38:58.583 --> 38:59.875
Wait...

39:01.167 --> 39:02.625
Spies don't work alone.

39:05.708 --> 39:23.417
"Under the banner of the Empire, we advance!"

39:25.250 --> 39:26.250
Halt!

39:27.375 --> 39:28.542
What's that?

39:31.917 --> 39:33.208
What is it?

39:39.417 --> 39:41.458
My father died.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.833
He's going home to be buried.

39:56.625 --> 39:59.042
Villagers must be buried in their own land.

40:01.208 --> 40:02.917
Please let us go!

40:15.167 --> 40:17.667
Father!

40:24.208 --> 40:25.500
Forward march!

40:26.750 --> 40:29.125
Don't cry...

40:30.792 --> 40:33.083
They've gone too far!

40:35.167 --> 40:46.792
"Under the banner of the Empire, we advance!"

40:48.583 --> 40:49.750
Tough luck!

40:49.833 --> 40:52.625
First you die, then you get stabbed!

40:52.917 --> 40:54.208
Don't blame me!

40:55.458 --> 40:56.708
We'll see each other soon.

40:58.917 --> 40:59.792
Hurry up!

40:59.875 --> 41:00.917
Let's go!

41:01.292 --> 41:02.542
Hurry up!

41:07.917 --> 41:09.083
"Forward march!"

41:35.167 --> 41:36.125
Morning!

41:36.208 --> 41:37.958
Good morning!

41:42.375 --> 41:43.833
Looks delicious!

41:46.917 --> 41:48.208
Enjoy it!

42:03.333 --> 42:04.667
No, thanks.

42:25.792 --> 42:27.750
"The Yangtze River flows ever east."

42:28.083 --> 42:29.792
"Carrying on its restless waves..."

42:30.625 --> 42:32.833
"...the spirits of bygone heroes"

42:33.792 --> 42:35.125
Who wrote that?

42:35.708 --> 42:37.000
Su Dongpo.

42:38.708 --> 42:40.583
Why was he called "Dongpo"?

42:43.292 --> 42:45.083
The "Po" means land.

42:45.667 --> 42:46.958
Maybe he grew vegetables.

42:47.042 --> 42:48.333
As you do, colonel.

42:52.208 --> 42:53.208
Try some.

43:00.375 --> 43:02.542
"When did the moon grow bright?"

43:02.625 --> 43:05.042
"I raise my cup to ask the azure sky."

43:06.333 --> 43:08.042
And who wrote that?

43:08.958 --> 43:10.250
That's also Su Dongpo.

43:10.375 --> 43:12.792
But the original line is slightly different.

43:12.875 --> 43:14.042
He uses the word "ji", not "he."

43:15.750 --> 43:19.125
What's the difference between them?

43:19.833 --> 43:23.042
The two words are spoken with different tones.

43:23.125 --> 43:24.542
So they sound different to Chinese ears.

43:25.292 --> 43:28.125
Classical Chinese poetry was meant to be sung.

43:28.542 --> 43:31.375
You need the right tone to match the melody.

43:32.042 --> 43:33.625
But the two words aren't quite interchangeable.

43:33.708 --> 43:35.667
Sometimes you need to use "ji"...

43:35.750 --> 43:37.792
And sometimes you need to use "he."

43:45.208 --> 43:46.917
Or you could use them both!

43:49.333 --> 43:53.458
As in "Make merry while we can,
for life is short."

43:55.958 --> 43:57.042
Brilliant!

44:01.792 --> 44:04.208
As a Chinese teacher...

44:05.500 --> 44:08.250
...you must be proficient in classical poetry.

44:09.458 --> 44:13.000
Now, use "ji" and "he"...

44:13.083 --> 44:14.667
...to make a poem.

44:16.625 --> 44:18.917
I'll count up to 7.

44:20.833 --> 44:23.167
When time's up...

44:24.458 --> 44:25.917
...you know what will happen.

44:30.958 --> 44:32.208
One...

44:33.917 --> 44:35.167
Two...

44:38.708 --> 44:40.042
Three...

44:43.750 --> 44:45.042
Four...

44:56.375 --> 44:57.792
"When did the moon grow bright?"

44:57.875 --> 44:59.417
"Gleaming like a hook."

45:00.458 --> 45:02.333
"Who are to rendezvous after twilight?"

45:04.375 --> 45:05.958
"When did the moon grow bright?"

45:07.125 --> 45:08.417
"Hanging above the darkness."

45:09.208 --> 45:11.083
"How to relieve the sorrow of parting?"

45:13.250 --> 45:14.833
"When did the moon grow bright?"

45:15.792 --> 45:17.500
"Ascending the pavilion."

45:19.917 --> 45:22.292
"When will the time of reunion come?"

45:40.000 --> 45:42.125
Why don't you go and join Dad?

45:45.500 --> 45:46.875
You'd like to go back?

45:50.875 --> 45:51.958
No.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.042
Neither would I.

45:54.792 --> 45:56.917
Why'd I want to live with him
and his first wife?

46:08.583 --> 46:09.833
Or you could join my brother.

46:09.917 --> 46:11.583
At least you wouldn't starve.

46:14.792 --> 46:16.333
Don't worry.

46:16.833 --> 46:19.875
I'm growing yams and eggplants on the roof.

46:19.958 --> 46:21.833
They'll keep us going for a while.

46:21.958 --> 46:23.208
Here, have one more.

46:24.542 --> 46:27.958
I don't want your father and his wife...

46:28.042 --> 46:29.167
...or their bastard...

46:29.250 --> 46:31.083
...scrounging on us!

46:57.458 --> 46:58.500
What are you doing?

46:58.583 --> 46:59.458
Just looking.

46:59.542 --> 47:00.917
What is there to see?

47:01.042 --> 47:02.417
What is there to see?

47:57.458 --> 47:58.958
What is this in English?

48:03.625 --> 48:05.000
What is this?

48:05.542 --> 48:06.583
Whiskey.

48:06.708 --> 48:07.917
Whiskey?

48:12.667 --> 48:14.583
This is how you drink it, watch me!

48:16.833 --> 48:18.833
Drink up!

48:25.958 --> 48:27.875
You can't drink!

48:28.792 --> 48:31.542
Her English is very good.

48:31.625 --> 48:33.792
I learnt all my English from her.

48:34.083 --> 48:36.125
Isn't her skin gorgeous?

48:36.208 --> 48:38.667
Her long legs look great, whatever she wears.

48:38.750 --> 48:40.458
She speaks English!

48:40.542 --> 48:42.542
You speak English?

48:43.208 --> 48:45.375
I studied in a missionary school.

48:45.458 --> 48:47.542
We must speak English there.

48:48.500 --> 48:51.667
The British enslaved you.

48:51.750 --> 48:54.708
And we came to liberate you.

48:56.417 --> 48:59.708
Liberate us with guns and roadblocks?

49:00.375 --> 49:01.417
Cheers!

49:01.625 --> 49:03.333
What about your family?

49:03.417 --> 49:04.875
Are they in Hong Kong?

49:05.292 --> 49:07.375
My father is the senior manager in a bank.

49:08.042 --> 49:11.417
Her father stays under guard,.
he isn't allowed home

49:11.667 --> 49:15.083
Troops escort him to and from work every day.

49:15.167 --> 49:16.583
It's horrible!

49:33.792 --> 49:36.333
Hey, stop playing that!

49:36.917 --> 49:39.125
Play 'China Nights.'

49:59.292 --> 50:03.833
Courtesy of Colonel Matsuda
of the Kempeitai...

50:04.417 --> 50:07.625
...we're here today
to celebrate your success...

50:07.708 --> 50:09.542
...in combating the guerrillas.

50:09.625 --> 50:11.375
We must intensify our efforts.

50:11.708 --> 50:14.500
To serve the Imperial Army...

50:15.292 --> 50:18.167
...Colonel Matsuda commands us...

50:18.250 --> 50:21.083
...to eradicate the guerrillas completely.

50:22.333 --> 50:24.167
The first step is to catch their leader.

50:24.292 --> 50:26.250
Blackie Lau.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.292
The Army says...

50:29.958 --> 50:32.042
...he's worth $5000 alive...

50:33.500 --> 50:35.583
...and $2500 dead.

50:38.292 --> 50:39.667
So we're here today...

50:40.083 --> 50:41.583
...first to celebrate our success.

50:42.833 --> 50:44.458
And second, to make a vow...

50:46.417 --> 50:48.333
...to wipe out the East River Guerrillas!

50:48.417 --> 50:50.708
Wipe out the East River Guerrillas!

50:50.792 --> 50:52.083
Take Blackie Lau alive!

50:52.167 --> 50:54.500
Take Blackie Lau alive!

50:56.500 --> 50:57.583
Drink to that!

51:00.250 --> 51:01.750
Captain Siu...

51:02.167 --> 51:03.958
Isn't $5000 a bit too low as a bounty?

51:04.917 --> 51:06.625
You think it's too low?

51:07.875 --> 51:09.958
Show us the color of your money!

51:10.208 --> 51:11.542
Who are you?

51:12.125 --> 51:13.458
Who am I?

51:14.833 --> 51:16.042
I forgot to tell you.

51:16.125 --> 51:18.125
I should have introduced myself.

51:18.208 --> 51:19.708
I'll tell you who I am...

51:20.292 --> 51:22.042
I'm the one you're looking for!

51:22.708 --> 51:23.750
Blackie Lau!

51:23.833 --> 51:25.583
Right! It's me! Hand over the $5000!

51:25.667 --> 51:27.292
Nobody moves!

51:27.375 --> 51:29.042
If you move, you die!

51:29.125 --> 51:30.292
Stay still!

51:42.083 --> 51:43.042
Brother!

51:45.667 --> 51:46.875
A grenade!

51:54.875 --> 51:55.500
Let's go!

51:55.583 --> 51:58.083
We're booked.

51:58.167 --> 52:00.000
Damn you!

52:23.583 --> 52:24.833
Dud grenade!

52:37.375 --> 52:39.292
This is the price you pay for treason!

52:43.958 --> 52:45.292
The handbills!

52:50.042 --> 52:51.042
Let's go.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.958
Who's there?

53:58.000 --> 53:59.458
You have good ears.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.583
You should be doing intelligence work.

54:04.250 --> 54:06.750
Mr Shen (Mao Dun) says you like his books.

54:12.333 --> 54:14.625
You're not here to kill me, then?

54:18.292 --> 54:19.625
This is for you.

54:21.292 --> 54:23.250
I'm here to thank you.

54:24.167 --> 54:26.250
Mr Shen is safe now.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.292
That's wonderful!

54:29.042 --> 54:31.167
Then we can expect to read new writing from him.

54:33.167 --> 54:34.458
Luckily you're brave.

54:35.042 --> 54:36.750
Not many girls are like you.

54:42.625 --> 54:44.417
Circumstances change people.

54:45.375 --> 54:47.958
Nowadays nobody is what they were before.

55:02.917 --> 55:05.125
You know what I'm doing now?

55:08.167 --> 55:10.792
I'd like to know what you did before.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.167
That doesn't matter.

55:14.833 --> 55:17.542
Under the Japanese, the barber loses his razor.

55:17.750 --> 55:19.458
The cook drops his pan.

55:19.750 --> 55:20.833
The schools are closed.

55:22.083 --> 55:23.625
Could you go back to being a teacher?

55:25.583 --> 55:27.583
How did you know I was a teacher?

55:30.500 --> 55:32.875
We're creating an Urban Unit.

55:34.417 --> 55:37.708
Specializing in undercover work
against the Japanese.

55:39.625 --> 55:40.917
Will you join us?

55:44.292 --> 55:45.875
Undercover work is dangerous.

55:46.250 --> 55:48.208
You might get caught, or even killed.

55:52.708 --> 55:54.417
You don't have to answer now.

55:54.500 --> 55:55.917
Think it over.

56:12.458 --> 56:13.833
Oh, I forgot to ask...

56:13.917 --> 56:15.125
D'you eat black-eyed peas?

56:16.208 --> 56:17.417
Yes, I do.

56:17.542 --> 56:20.125
Good! Those are black-eyed pea dumplings.

56:20.500 --> 56:22.875
Made by the women in the village...
they're delicious.

56:34.250 --> 56:36.083
No, they're for you and your mother.

56:36.167 --> 56:38.667
It's all right, we can share one.

56:38.750 --> 56:40.625
We can share one.

56:40.750 --> 56:42.500
Please...

56:42.583 --> 56:44.333
Then I'll take one.

56:47.333 --> 56:49.458
Actually, I haven't had dinner yet.

56:57.542 --> 57:01.208
Tastes good, but a bit sticky.

57:01.750 --> 57:04.417
You said you came to thank me.

57:04.500 --> 57:07.125
I think you really came to recruit me...

57:07.208 --> 57:09.792
...with two dumplings.

57:10.042 --> 57:12.625
No, one and a half!

57:14.042 --> 57:15.792
Take it.

57:17.708 --> 57:21.625
"East River Brigade Manifesto"

57:39.625 --> 57:40.750
Where are you off to?

57:40.833 --> 57:41.958
I'm seeing a friend.

57:42.500 --> 57:44.083
You have so many friends?

57:44.167 --> 57:47.208
Who was that last night?

57:55.375 --> 57:57.000
Don't get any ideas!

57:58.292 --> 58:00.833
You remember your cousin
is getting married today?

58:01.125 --> 58:02.708
Can we go together when you get back?

58:02.792 --> 58:04.417
I'm not sure I'll be back in time.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.708
Your aunt has only one daughter.

58:07.792 --> 58:10.083
We can't be late for her wedding.

58:10.167 --> 58:11.542
We're family!

58:11.625 --> 58:13.625
I know.

58:16.208 --> 58:18.000
You'll be going dressed like that?

58:18.333 --> 58:20.542
It's the only colorful thing I have.

58:20.625 --> 58:22.583
All right, then I'll dress up.

58:22.667 --> 58:24.917
Yes, you do that.

58:26.625 --> 58:29.375
I'll wait for you at 4 outside the Millennium!

58:53.083 --> 58:54.333
Miss!

59:21.417 --> 59:22.458
What's this?

59:24.542 --> 59:25.958
As you see.

59:35.375 --> 59:36.917
It could be a trap.

59:46.792 --> 59:47.792
On your way!

59:48.125 --> 59:49.417
He's talking to you!

59:57.083 --> 59:58.417
Hey!

59:59.333 --> 01:00:00.875
Ng's Chinese Medicine.

01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:19.042
Shanghai Street, please.

01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:27.375
Have some water.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.458
Have you eaten?

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:31.458
I'm waiting for dinner.

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:33.375
Don't expect too much!

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:36.792
Just one small cake for each guest!

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:40.250
We're lucky to get cake at all!

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.625
Greedy!

01:00:42.958 --> 01:00:44.250
Auntie...

01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:46.208
...will you live with your daughter?

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:49.667
It doesn't matter, I can live anywhere.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.625
I'm just happy that she's found a husband.

01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:57.458
It's better to have a family
in times like these.

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:00.792
Where's your mother?

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.250
Mother...

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:05.500
I'm meeting her there, she'll make her own way.

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:09.583
She says I'm not dressed right for the occasion.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.250
Do you have anything I can borrow?

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:18.042
Perfect fit!

01:01:21.042 --> 01:01:23.875
In a qipao, your hair should be in a bun.

01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:25.792
The phoenix-tail bun...

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:28.333
...used to be obligatory!

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:30.208
It's lovely.

01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:32.625
Isn't it nice?

01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.500
I must go.

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:38.042
Just a moment...

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:41.000
Something's missing.

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:48.042
Take this too.

01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:50.625
Yes, the perfect match!

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:53.583
I'm off, see you at the Millennium.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:09.750
Thank you.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:54.958
You want herbs?

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:57.458
Yes, medicinal soup.

01:03:11.292 --> 01:03:13.542
It's all ready, the bed's installed
and the hair's been combed.

01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:15.250
The bridal gifts have been delivered.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:17.292
Yes, yes, I'm coming now!

01:03:17.792 --> 01:03:19.167
There you are!

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.458
Congratulations!

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:22.208
Thank you.

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.917
Lan, your cousin's in there.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.458
I'll go to find her.

01:03:49.542 --> 01:03:51.792
Why were you in such a rush to get married?

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:55.292
These days what else can you hope for?

01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:58.250
Find a husband, reduce the hassles.

01:03:58.375 --> 01:04:00.292
Who'd be hassling you?

01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:03.125
I pre-empted them by marrying!

01:04:03.542 --> 01:04:05.792
What are you waiting for?

01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:10.042
We broke up.

01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:14.250
You always were a tough one.

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:16.125
Even when you were little.

01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:20.125
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

01:04:20.542 --> 01:04:23.208
At least you'd have a family of your own.

01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:27.292
Just tell him to pick an auspicious date
and have done with it.

01:04:28.667 --> 01:04:30.542
I don't even know where he is.

01:04:31.042 --> 01:04:33.625
This is driving me crazy!

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:35.583
The ceremony is about to begin...

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:37.250
...and our chaperone's gone missing!

01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:38.917
I told you I wanted one of my own.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.458
You think I didn't try to hire one?

01:04:41.083 --> 01:04:43.667
It's not easy
to find a 'lucky woman' these days.

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:47.042
One with her entire family alive.

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:50.875
Sorry, it isn't easy managing
two weddings at once.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.792
At the tea-serving ceremony, remember...

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.417
...to pour for your father's family first...

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.875
...then your mother's.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.917
Don't get it wrong! The age-cards...

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.167
...the 3 letters and 6 rituals are all done.

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:03.000
Let's not bother with the sedan,
the fire basin and the rice-throwing.

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:05.208
No! We must do the rice-throwing!

01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:08.583
As you wish,
but the other wedding did without it.

01:05:08.667 --> 01:05:10.875
People are starving, and you feed chickens?

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:13.458
I'll be right back.

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:19.333
You must throw rice for the golden rooster.

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:21.875
Otherwise the bride will get pushed around.

01:05:22.042 --> 01:05:24.458
Don't worry, I'll throw the rice.

01:05:24.542 --> 01:05:25.375
You know how?

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:26.750
No, I don't.

01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:28.750
They say...

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:32.292
Throw some up to honor the celestial emperor.

01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:36.875
And throw some down to honor the in-laws.

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:38.292
I think that's right.

01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:40.917
All right, some up and some down.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.792
I'll do it now.

01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:44.125
Don't bother! Forget about it!

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:45.708
Why do you say that?

01:05:45.792 --> 01:05:47.542
We're not cutting corners!

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:50.208
We've done the 3 letters and 6 rituals properly.

01:05:50.708 --> 01:05:51.958
These are difficult times!

01:05:52.042 --> 01:05:55.042
Do you know what I've been through?

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:04.125
Let's welcome the couple!
May their house be filled with riches!

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:07.750
May you bring good fortune
to your husband, master and family!

01:06:28.042 --> 01:06:31.750
Please return all the tableware when you finish.

01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:33.208
You think we're thieves?

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:36.917
Forgive me, madam, but times are hard.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.875
This is all the tableware we have left.

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:43.375
If we lose any more, we'll have to close down.

01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:49.375
Waiter, please keep count!

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:22.542
They're fighting back!

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:41.458
Captain Kau,
please turn out the light when you go.

01:07:41.542 --> 01:07:43.375
Colonel Yamaguchi is very cost-conscious.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.625
Yamaguchi says there are guerrilla spies here.

01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:55.000
You think he's right?

01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.125
I don't know, there might be.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.667
Are there or not?

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:06.000
In times like these, anything's possible.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.083
"Arrest list"

01:08:09.167 --> 01:08:11.167
Who do you think is a spy?

01:08:11.417 --> 01:08:12.917
How should I know?

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:14.375
You know me...

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.875
All I care about is food!

01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:20.957
You're a cunning devil...

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.625
It could easily be you!

01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:26.832
Right! It could!

01:08:27.957 --> 01:08:29.042
Major Honjo...

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.125
...wants me to take rice to his girlfriend.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:34.417
When I get back, I'll be all yours!

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.707
Get out of here!

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.207
See you.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.082
"Leave immediately."

01:10:33.875 --> 01:10:35.875
Where were you last night?

01:11:06.542 --> 01:11:08.750
You couldn't even kill a rabbit.

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:11.042
...and now you want to kill Japanese?

01:11:16.292 --> 01:11:17.958
I'm asking you!

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:22.250
What are you asking?
Haven't you seen everything already?

01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:25.875
If you're worried they'll bring trouble...

01:11:25.958 --> 01:11:27.208
...I'll leave them outside.

01:11:27.292 --> 01:11:28.667
That hurt!

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:33.083
It'll hurt when the Japanese catch you!

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:38.542
I'm your mother,
do I worry you'll get me into trouble?

01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:40.792
Is that how you talk to me?

01:11:41.583 --> 01:11:44.625
Killing Japanese is a job for men.

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:47.708
They're tough and strong, but what about you?

01:11:47.792 --> 01:11:51.542
Weak and clumsy!

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:55.875
It's all right to die,
but don't burden your friends.

01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:02.500
We...

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:05.542
We're counting on them to bring us peace!

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.750
Don't do anything silly!

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:11.583
Mother...

01:12:13.042 --> 01:12:15.000
If anything happens to me...

01:12:15.083 --> 01:12:17.000
...I won't be a burden to them.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.583
And don't be too sad.

01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:21.750
Oh my!

01:12:23.167 --> 01:12:25.667
How can you say that?

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:27.792
Spit and say it again! Go on!

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:29.125
Spit!

01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:30.458
Quick!

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.250
All right, don't worry.

01:12:35.917 --> 01:12:36.875
You want some congee?

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:39.000
No, I've been up all night.

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:43.500
You need to keep up your energy.

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:44.750
Killing Japanese takes energy.

01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:45.583
Have some congee.

01:12:45.667 --> 01:12:48.333
No, I do prefer some sleep.

01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:09.542
"The Flame of Resistance"

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.458
Let's try the dress on!

01:14:04.417 --> 01:14:05.708
Miss Cheung!

01:14:05.792 --> 01:14:07.083
Look!

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:28.875
Thank you.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.750
Get ready!

01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:12.125
Let's move!

01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:12.333
They called me "Little Ben."

01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:14.917
I was just a kid back then.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:18.042
But already a member of the junior team.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:19.917
I delivered messages.

01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:22.042
It was a great honor.

01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:49.542
So you're leaving?

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:51.333
What about me?

01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:53.750
I didn't say I wouldn't come back.

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:54.917
When will you come back?

01:18:55.167 --> 01:18:56.625
When we win the war.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.125
I won't last that long.

01:18:58.792 --> 01:19:00.000
Fighting the Japanese...

01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:02.708
What difference can you make?

01:19:03.042 --> 01:19:05.042
Mother, if everyone thought that way...

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:07.583
...there'd be no victory.

01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:12.542
All right!

01:19:12.625 --> 01:19:14.250
When you come back victorious...

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:15.333
...I'll be dead!

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.417
Ma! Why do you say such things?

01:19:20.208 --> 01:19:21.792
Take care of yourself.

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:33.083
Lan dear!

01:19:33.167 --> 01:19:34.375
Lan dear!

01:19:37.042 --> 01:19:39.042
Take this.

01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:07.167
It was probably in 1944...

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:09.500
...that I met Miss Fong again.

01:20:09.583 --> 01:20:12.625
By then...

01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:15.792
...she was captain of the Urban Unit.

01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:35.292
Sister Fong!

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:38.458
Come inside! There are bandits around!

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.208
What are you doing here?

01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:23.333
What do you mean?

01:21:26.167 --> 01:21:27.542
I was asking her.

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:29.917
Sister Fong, you know him?

01:21:30.125 --> 01:21:32.083
He was a pupil in my class.

01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:33.292
Cheng Ka-Ben!

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:36.125
Isn't that right?

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:38.333
Not any more.

01:21:48.042 --> 01:21:49.625
Get out of those wet clothes.

01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:51.417
But we have only women's clothes...

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.708
Shouldn't you ask me
for the message first, Miss?

01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:55.292
The message?

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:03.792
Report!

01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:06.625
On the mountain,
they need supplies, weapons and medicines.

01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:07.917
Especially quinine.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.458
Thousands of mosquitoes,
many are down with fever.

01:22:09.542 --> 01:22:11.458
And food... they're running out of rice.

01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:13.958
How can they fight on empty stomachs?

01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:17.125
Hey, be careful with that!

01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:21.542
I've never lost one!

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.917
I came forty miles down the mountain.

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:34.750
In one go.

01:22:36.375 --> 01:22:37.708
I didn't stop.

01:22:40.125 --> 01:22:43.250
I almost forgot, should I stand night watch?

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.250
Get some sleep!

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:53.542
When I was coming down the mountain...

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.875
...I passed a cemetery.

01:22:57.542 --> 01:23:00.417
I sat down on a tombstone to rest.

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:03.000
All of a sudden...

01:23:03.083 --> 01:23:06.542
...a little guy dressed in black appeared.

01:23:08.167 --> 01:23:10.375
When I got up, so did he.

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:13.500
When I left, so did he.

01:23:13.833 --> 01:23:16.375
And when I sat down, so did he.

01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:18.375
You know what that was?

01:23:18.792 --> 01:23:20.417
The spirit of a wild mountain dog.

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.750
They eat the hearts of humans.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.333
Yeah, they claw them out of your body!

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:30.125
Blood everywhere!

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:33.042
Don't scare me.

01:23:36.917 --> 01:23:39.292
If I was the chief
of the wild mountain dogs...

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:43.000
...I would set them all loose...

01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:47.500
...to tear out the hearts and lungs
of the Japanese.

01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:49.333
And eat them all up!

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:09.000
Don't be afraid, it's the wind.

01:24:12.167 --> 01:24:14.125
I think of Miss Fong very often.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.958
The big brothers and sisters...

01:24:17.042 --> 01:24:19.708
...looked after us well.

01:24:20.167 --> 01:24:22.292
They cooked for us.

01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:26.917
When our clothes got torn...

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
...they mended them.

01:24:32.375 --> 01:24:33.833
I miss her so much.

01:24:39.167 --> 01:24:40.417
Excuse me...

01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:38.292
Lan dear?

01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:43.042
Lan dear!

01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:45.542
Ma.

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:47.917
You've lost weight.

01:25:49.417 --> 01:25:50.875
You still know your way home?

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:52.250
Come home!

01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:53.625
Come home!

01:26:12.958 --> 01:26:13.875
Ma.

01:26:14.542 --> 01:26:15.708
I have to go.

01:26:16.167 --> 01:26:17.417
Go where?

01:26:17.833 --> 01:26:19.250
To see a friend.

01:26:19.958 --> 01:26:21.750
See a friend in this state?

01:26:22.375 --> 01:26:24.542
You're exhausted.

01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:26.167
Take some rest.

01:26:26.458 --> 01:26:27.792
I'll go.

01:26:28.167 --> 01:26:29.500
No, you can't.

01:26:29.917 --> 01:26:30.542
You can't.

01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:32.708
Mrs Wan has done it.

01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:36.375
Song's wife has done it, but I can't?

01:27:25.792 --> 01:27:26.917
Mrs Fong!

01:27:27.625 --> 01:27:28.833
Ah, you're here.

01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:31.167
Your daughter...

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:33.250
...has sent some salted fish for you.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:35.708
Thank you.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.833
We can have it with congee.

01:27:38.125 --> 01:27:39.833
Sit down...

01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:41.500
Are you hungry?

01:27:41.583 --> 01:27:42.792
Starving.

01:27:42.875 --> 01:27:45.208
I'll bring you some congee.

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:46.292
Thank you.

01:28:01.917 --> 01:28:04.708
Take it slowly.

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.208
But I have to take things
to Ng's Herbal Medicine shop.

01:28:08.292 --> 01:28:10.125
And pick up something for Sister Fong too.

01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:11.875
You don't need to rush

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.625
Rest for a bit.

01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:16.250
Or you might faint!

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:17.417
No need to rush!

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.625
I'll get you some sweet potato.

01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:25.375
Mrs Ng...

01:29:26.292 --> 01:29:29.542
The medicine has arrived
from the countryside, it's excellent.

01:29:30.333 --> 01:29:31.625
Please bring it through to the back.

01:29:31.708 --> 01:29:33.958
Would you mind closing the door?

01:29:41.458 --> 01:29:42.833
Take a seat and I'll be with you.

01:30:30.917 --> 01:30:32.500
This is very important.

01:30:32.583 --> 01:30:33.667
Be very careful.

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:34.500
I know.

01:30:38.792 --> 01:30:39.792
Take care.

01:30:41.083 --> 01:30:42.833
You too.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.625
Where are you going?

01:30:59.708 --> 01:31:00.625
To Ng's.

01:31:00.708 --> 01:31:02.417
I've been there.

01:31:11.333 --> 01:31:14.583
Mrs Ng says this is very important.

01:31:14.667 --> 01:31:16.625
Make sure you don't lose it.

01:31:16.708 --> 01:31:18.000
Keep it well hidden.

01:31:20.917 --> 01:31:23.458
Shall I sew it in for you?

01:31:23.542 --> 01:31:24.292
Yes please.

01:31:28.625 --> 01:31:29.875
I'd better go with you.

01:31:29.958 --> 01:31:32.625
No, it's my job!

01:31:32.708 --> 01:31:34.542
And Sister Fong doesn't know about it.

01:31:34.625 --> 01:31:37.500
I've done it for her many times!

01:31:37.583 --> 01:31:39.625
I'm an old hand!

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:41.667
Let me have it.

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:10.542
At this pier,
they check the boats, not the travellers.

01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:11.875
- Really?
- Yes.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:35.708
Together?

01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:48.333
What are you doing?

01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:50.292
Nothing.

01:32:52.917 --> 01:32:54.792
It's just dried vegetables.

01:32:56.125 --> 01:32:57.375
And what's this?

01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:03.375
I don't know what it is, I can't read.

01:33:04.708 --> 01:33:06.208
I'm just a villager.

01:33:06.292 --> 01:33:07.958
I make a little money...

01:33:08.042 --> 01:33:10.375
...selling used clothes.

01:33:10.458 --> 01:33:11.417
I don't know what those things are.

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:12.917
You old fool!

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.208
You don't know what this is?

01:33:14.292 --> 01:33:16.042
The Japanese would kill you for carrying this!

01:33:16.417 --> 01:33:17.250
Kill me?

01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:20.167
You don't know any better, do you?

01:33:21.083 --> 01:33:22.583
I can't read.

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.000
Making easy money, huh?

01:33:25.417 --> 01:33:27.167
Don't make trouble! Get on board!

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:29.458
Thank you, sir!

01:33:35.667 --> 01:33:38.208
I wish I could read...

01:33:45.875 --> 01:33:47.542
Thank you.

01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:55.875
Luckily he let us go.

01:33:55.958 --> 01:33:57.708
I'm so scared!

01:33:58.708 --> 01:34:00.583
(Hindi) Take out your money!

01:34:01.458 --> 01:34:05.500
Where is your money?

01:34:06.542 --> 01:34:08.000
Where's the money?

01:34:08.083 --> 01:34:08.792
Hurry up!

01:34:08.875 --> 01:34:10.333
Hand it over!

01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:14.500
Quick!

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.333
For two?

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:23.542
What's this? So little?

01:34:24.208 --> 01:34:25.167
So little?

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:26.750
I have no money

01:34:26.833 --> 01:34:28.500
No money? Then get off the boat!

01:34:28.792 --> 01:34:30.208
What is this?

01:34:31.125 --> 01:34:33.167
No money? Lousy pauper!

01:34:34.042 --> 01:34:35.375
Here...

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.292
These people hide money in their clothes.

01:34:38.917 --> 01:34:40.500
Search her pockets.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.875
Be careful.

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:46.625
Stand up! Stand up!

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.458
No money?

01:34:50.542 --> 01:34:52.708
No money...

01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:54.208
No money...

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.333
What's this?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.042
What is that?

01:35:17.375 --> 01:35:19.458
I found some paper!

01:35:19.542 --> 01:35:21.583
Stay here, I'll tell the chief.

01:35:21.667 --> 01:35:22.875
Okay!

01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:26.917
Sir!

01:35:27.542 --> 01:35:29.667
Stand up!

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:33.792
Where is it?

01:35:36.917 --> 01:35:38.792
Say you don't know me.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.292
Still not back?

01:35:54.625 --> 01:35:58.375
No, she said she'd get back before dark.

01:38:11.958 --> 01:38:13.083
Come with me.

01:38:17.208 --> 01:38:18.750
Stay calm and listen.

01:38:20.083 --> 01:38:21.458
Your mother was caught.

01:38:21.792 --> 01:38:23.292
Together with a girl

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:26.792
Where are they?

01:38:27.375 --> 01:38:29.458
They're being held at the Kempeitai.

01:38:29.542 --> 01:38:30.458
They might be moved later.

01:38:30.542 --> 01:38:31.917
The Kempeitai...

01:38:32.375 --> 01:38:34.833
I'm in the Surveillance Unit, under Yamaguchi.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.792
I saw what happened.

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:38.917
It's urgent...

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.917
...we must find a way to save her.

01:38:41.875 --> 01:38:43.167
I'll think of something.

01:38:43.958 --> 01:38:45.375
Can you get help?

01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:49.000
You joined them?

01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:52.417
You think I'd do that?

01:38:57.792 --> 01:38:59.167
You wouldn't.

01:38:59.292 --> 01:39:00.792
We must get your mother out quickly.

01:39:01.333 --> 01:39:03.625
You know what the Kempeitai is like.

01:39:03.917 --> 01:39:05.708
I'm afraid she won't last long in there.

01:39:07.625 --> 01:39:09.292
I can't take the decision.

01:39:09.375 --> 01:39:10.875
I'll get orders as soon as I can.

01:39:10.958 --> 01:39:12.125
Listen...

01:39:12.833 --> 01:39:13.958
Act quickly!

01:39:14.667 --> 01:39:16.417
I have to get the last boat back.

01:39:17.167 --> 01:39:18.792
Otherwise they'll suspect me.

01:39:23.292 --> 01:39:24.458
I'll wait to hear from you.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.042
Gam-Wing...

01:39:34.958 --> 01:39:36.667
Be careful!

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.708
Someone might be watching.

01:39:42.375 --> 01:39:43.917
I won't give you a hug.

01:40:39.458 --> 01:40:40.958
You can't come with me.

01:40:43.542 --> 01:40:46.208
That's an order, I can't explain why...

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:48.000
But you have to go back.

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:07.208
Captain, you grew up in a village too?

01:41:07.833 --> 01:41:08.875
Yes.

01:41:12.167 --> 01:41:13.917
Haven't had pickles like these for ages.

01:41:14.042 --> 01:41:15.250
Help yourself.

01:41:15.625 --> 01:41:16.917
They're delicious.

01:41:18.542 --> 01:41:19.792
You're not eating?

01:41:19.875 --> 01:41:21.333
I'm full.

01:41:25.417 --> 01:41:27.125
Captain, I've darned it.

01:41:27.333 --> 01:41:28.208
Thank you.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.375
Fung, come with me.

01:41:42.458 --> 01:41:43.667
Village chief...

01:41:48.833 --> 01:41:50.125
What happened?

01:41:51.042 --> 01:41:52.250
The Japanese have caught my mother.

01:41:52.333 --> 01:41:53.125
When?

01:41:53.208 --> 01:41:54.542
This afternoon.

01:41:56.917 --> 01:41:57.667
Don't worry.

01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:58.750
Village chief!

01:42:03.292 --> 01:42:04.958
The Japanese are here!

01:42:05.042 --> 01:42:07.333
They're about to enter the village!

01:42:07.625 --> 01:42:08.417
Don't panic.

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.125
Clear all this away.

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:13.000
Stay calm and follow me.

01:42:23.042 --> 01:42:24.042
Take care!

01:42:32.125 --> 01:42:34.042
Go that way.

01:42:34.458 --> 01:42:35.958
Don't worry.

01:43:06.417 --> 01:43:07.875
Why aren't they here?

01:43:14.375 --> 01:43:15.625
Who's there?

01:43:15.708 --> 01:43:16.625
Halt!

01:43:32.625 --> 01:43:33.667
Halt!

01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:36.750
Don't move!

01:44:19.333 --> 01:44:21.208
Your mother is in the Kempeitai?

01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:23.750
For now, yes.

01:44:24.833 --> 01:44:27.917
There's a shallow stream behind the building.

01:44:29.292 --> 01:44:31.042
We have undercover agents in there.

01:44:31.125 --> 01:44:32.333
They'll help us.

01:44:40.083 --> 01:44:41.083
Don't be afraid...

01:44:41.167 --> 01:44:43.667
...say you don't know me.

01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:44.917
Remember...

01:44:56.542 --> 01:44:58.625
Who are you?

01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:01.208
I'm just a villager.

01:45:02.292 --> 01:45:03.958
I can't read.

01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:06.500
I sell used clothes.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.667
I saw this jacket and just put it on.

01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:12.792
I thought it looked nice.

01:45:12.917 --> 01:45:14.958
What was that paper?

01:45:17.333 --> 01:45:18.750
I can't read.

01:45:19.917 --> 01:45:21.500
I don't know what it was

01:45:21.917 --> 01:45:23.208
Can you read?

01:45:31.167 --> 01:45:33.792
She doesn't know me, she just sat next to me!

01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:45.083
Does it hurt, Mrs Fong?

01:45:45.167 --> 01:45:47.125
I'll be fine.

01:45:49.458 --> 01:45:52.875
It hurts less than the first time I gave birth.

01:45:59.042 --> 01:46:01.500
If you manage to get out of here...

01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:04.542
...tell my daughter that...

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.042
...I won't say a word.

01:46:07.125 --> 01:46:09.667
I won't get anyone else into trouble.

01:46:11.042 --> 01:46:14.167
Please don't say that.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.542
She must be in one of these rooms.

01:47:12.833 --> 01:47:14.375
The main entrance must be over there.

01:47:14.833 --> 01:47:15.708
Then...

01:47:15.792 --> 01:47:17.417
...we can set off a bomb there...

01:47:17.542 --> 01:47:18.875
Then you can break in on this side.

01:47:38.708 --> 01:47:40.125
There are two dogs.

01:47:57.542 --> 01:47:58.958
We'll bribe the guy who feeds them.

01:47:59.875 --> 01:48:02.250
You go in from here and get them out.

01:48:02.333 --> 01:48:03.417
Go down the slope.

01:48:04.375 --> 01:48:05.417
I'll cover you.

01:48:07.375 --> 01:48:10.125
The road is just beyond the forest.

01:48:55.292 --> 01:48:56.292
It'll be alright...

01:48:56.375 --> 01:48:57.958
Tomorrow they'll be crying.

01:49:01.167 --> 01:49:02.083
Let's go.

01:49:06.125 --> 01:49:08.000
You and the main team will carry out the rescue.

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:11.042
My armed team will provide the cover.

01:49:11.667 --> 01:49:12.667
I'll stay with you.

01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:15.125
No, you get the prisoners
and I'll provide cover.

01:49:16.833 --> 01:49:18.500
I want to stay with you.

01:49:20.333 --> 01:49:21.375
Listen...

01:49:21.458 --> 01:49:22.792
I don't want you to die...

01:49:22.875 --> 01:49:25.458
...rescuing your mother, understand?

01:49:25.542 --> 01:49:27.875
Your assignment is to rescue them.

01:49:34.667 --> 01:49:36.917
You don't think it will work, do you?

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.583
We can't even break in.

01:49:45.208 --> 01:49:46.833
We have to give it a try.

01:49:57.333 --> 01:49:58.750
If anything goes wrong...

01:49:59.167 --> 01:50:01.208
...the Urban and Firearms Units...

01:50:03.292 --> 01:50:04.542
...will be lost.

01:50:39.292 --> 01:50:41.458
My mother is selfish.

01:50:46.375 --> 01:50:48.417
She hates losing face.

01:50:51.583 --> 01:50:53.083
But she has a kind heart.

01:50:55.417 --> 01:50:56.542
Fong Lan.

01:50:58.375 --> 01:50:59.625
Fong Lan.

01:51:06.125 --> 01:51:09.417
Back when I first joined the Urban Unit...

01:51:11.292 --> 01:51:13.792
...she slept badly for days.

01:51:18.625 --> 01:51:20.458
I should have comforted her.

01:51:28.792 --> 01:51:31.458
Perhaps I shouldn't have told her.

01:51:31.542 --> 01:51:33.917
Then she wouldn't have to deliver messages.

01:51:36.667 --> 01:51:38.542
And she wouldn't have been caught.

01:51:50.042 --> 01:51:51.750
But it will be alright now.

01:51:54.542 --> 01:51:56.417
She won't have to worry about me.

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:01.042
She won't have to live in fear.

01:52:28.167 --> 01:52:29.958
Let's go.

01:53:15.958 --> 01:53:19.042
What do you do for a living, Ben?

01:53:19.667 --> 01:53:21.333
I drive a taxi.

01:53:21.458 --> 01:53:22.708
You're still working?

01:53:22.792 --> 01:53:23.917
Yes.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.333
Impressive!

01:53:28.125 --> 01:53:30.042
I have to eat!

01:53:32.417 --> 01:53:34.958
Of all of you, Ben was the only member...

01:53:35.042 --> 01:53:36.708
...of the East River Brigade?

01:53:38.542 --> 01:53:41.167
They say you're a great whistler...

01:54:04.583 --> 01:54:08.042
"The wind which carried
the rays of the setting sun has died down."

01:54:08.667 --> 01:54:11.417
"It's as if it melted away."

01:54:12.292 --> 01:54:15.000
"The gleaming crests
of countless waves in the sea..."

01:54:15.083 --> 01:54:18.375
"...have flattened into a dull green mass."

01:54:20.042 --> 01:54:22.667
"From far, comes the solemn sound of a bugle."

01:54:23.667 --> 01:54:27.917
"Night's black curtain is falling,
but glimmers of light remain."

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.208
"The wind which seemed
to have whispered its last..."

01:54:32.292 --> 01:54:34.250
"...is suddenly back."

01:54:34.958 --> 01:54:37.542
"Now it sounds like a muffled drum."

01:54:38.083 --> 01:54:40.667
"Boom - lun - lun, Boom - lun - lun."

01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:43.792
"No, not merely the sound of the wind but..."

01:55:34.667 --> 01:55:36.917
Mrs Fong...

01:55:37.958 --> 01:55:39.542
She...

01:55:39.625 --> 01:55:42.042
...insisted that she didn't know me.

01:55:42.583 --> 01:55:45.833
So they let me go.

01:55:47.417 --> 01:55:49.167
I'm so sorry...

01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:51.042
It's good that you're safe.

01:56:06.375 --> 01:56:07.292
On your knees!

01:56:17.292 --> 01:56:18.500
Take these!

01:56:20.083 --> 01:56:21.250
Dig!

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:23.667
Quicker!

01:57:04.542 --> 01:57:08.792
I'm sorry.

01:57:08.875 --> 01:57:10.958
It's my fault you were caught.

01:58:01.667 --> 01:58:02.958
What are you doing?

01:58:07.042 --> 01:58:08.417
Your safe is open.

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:11.083
I was wondering if I should close it.

01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:13.167
You were wondering...

01:58:14.208 --> 01:58:16.208
...if you should steal the map.

01:58:23.667 --> 01:58:28.042
This was made in our print room.

01:58:29.708 --> 01:58:34.500
You seem to have a habit of stealing things.

01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:37.083
Oh, that?

01:58:37.792 --> 01:58:39.208
I took that for the toilet.

01:58:39.542 --> 01:58:42.042
You Japanese have toilet paper, but we don't.

01:58:47.708 --> 01:58:49.042
Are you playing games with me?

01:58:51.208 --> 01:58:55.625
You're going to die, and you play games?

01:58:57.417 --> 01:58:58.667
Today...

01:59:00.083 --> 01:59:02.958
...some of our secret depots were bombed today.

01:59:04.792 --> 01:59:07.125
Your people did it?

01:59:08.375 --> 01:59:17.042
So all you people
are good for is poetry and stealing?

01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:19.958
And your people?

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.292
All you're good for is killing and plundering?

01:59:23.833 --> 01:59:25.417
I don't understand.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.500
You're...

01:59:33.042 --> 01:59:38.417
I thought we knew each other well.

01:59:41.542 --> 01:59:43.875
There are many things here...

01:59:44.417 --> 01:59:46.458
...that you will never understand.

01:59:46.542 --> 01:59:47.792
Anyway...

01:59:48.167 --> 01:59:49.917
You won't last long here.

01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:55.875
This is not about Japan and China!

01:59:57.458 --> 01:59:59.292
This is about me and you!

02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:30.083
In other countries...

02:00:33.167 --> 02:00:37.083
...there is coming-of-age ritual as well.

02:00:43.625 --> 02:00:49.375
My father made these six cuts.

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:55.917
You're now a real man.

02:00:58.833 --> 02:01:04.250
You didn't kneel down after the two slashes.

02:01:05.167 --> 02:01:07.000
So I'll let you go.

02:01:09.083 --> 02:01:10.500
You can leave now.

02:01:13.125 --> 02:01:14.542
Leave.

02:01:33.875 --> 02:01:35.375
You want one?

02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:51.667
"When did the moon grow bright?"

02:01:54.375 --> 02:01:57.042
"I raise my cup to ask the azure sky."

02:02:27.833 --> 02:02:29.500
I came to say goodbye.

02:02:31.542 --> 02:02:33.125
The Japanese are nearly finished.

02:02:34.208 --> 02:02:35.833
I'm being transferred to Huizhou...

02:02:35.917 --> 02:02:37.708
...to extend the North Canton front.

02:02:41.625 --> 02:02:43.792
Take care in Huizhou.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.417
"Don't let your boat topple in shallow water."

02:02:49.333 --> 02:02:50.958
You don't think much of me!

02:02:51.792 --> 02:02:53.292
I have great expectations of you.

02:02:54.292 --> 02:02:56.792
You risk your life on every mission.

02:03:00.708 --> 02:03:01.833
I tell you...

02:03:03.458 --> 02:03:05.708
Since the day I joined the guerrillas...

02:03:05.958 --> 02:03:08.042
...I've never expected to get out alive.

02:03:18.792 --> 02:03:19.917
In fact...

02:03:21.875 --> 02:03:24.333
...we're lucky to be able to
say goodbye like this.

02:03:26.458 --> 02:03:29.542
You know how I said goodbye to my comrades?

02:03:33.083 --> 02:03:34.083
He's gone!

02:03:35.208 --> 02:03:36.625
Farewell!

02:03:38.833 --> 02:03:41.375
Really.

02:03:43.375 --> 02:03:45.500
Life has treated us well.

02:03:46.375 --> 02:03:47.875
Stay alive.

02:03:53.583 --> 02:03:55.250
My original name was Hung Sau-Fong.

02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:57.708
I will turn 27 towards the end of the year.

02:03:59.417 --> 02:04:00.958
Remember my name...

02:04:01.042 --> 02:04:02.333
...and you'll be able to find me.

02:04:08.583 --> 02:04:09.917
I'll remember.

02:04:12.083 --> 02:04:13.625
See you after the victory.

02:04:18.208 --> 02:04:19.625
For sure.

02:05:50.125 --> 02:05:50.875
Sorry...

02:05:50.958 --> 02:05:53.083
I'm in a hurry, can't give you a lift.

02:05:53.167 --> 02:05:54.625
Bye...
