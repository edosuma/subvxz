WEBVTT

00:00.712 --> 00:02.878
- Oh, this is good.
- Oh, this... look at this one.

00:02.879 --> 00:05.269
Oh, it's so timeless.
It's perfect.

00:05.270 --> 00:07.488
Yeah, timeless, meaning you can wait
two or five years to wear it.

00:07.489 --> 00:08.805
Don't be jealous.

00:08.806 --> 00:10.102
Well, well, well.

00:10.103 --> 00:13.160
If it isn't a young Barbra Streisand
and an old Betty White.

00:13.161 --> 00:15.245
Where is Gay Cyclops?

00:15.246 --> 00:16.858
Still trying
to stumble his way in?

00:16.859 --> 00:18.402
We can't come here anymore.

00:18.403 --> 00:21.668
Rachel, I, uh, brought
an engagement gift for you.

00:21.669 --> 00:22.864
Hmm.

00:25.575 --> 00:27.577
Whoa. Oh, whoa, whoa!
Oh, my God!

00:27.578 --> 00:29.259
Oh, no, that is...
that is Photoshopped.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.540
His thing is not that small
or... or brown.

00:31.541 --> 00:33.291
And he could never fit
into those pumps.

00:33.292 --> 00:35.085
Just think, from
now until eternity,

00:35.086 --> 00:37.935
every time someone
Googles Finn Hudson,

00:37.936 --> 00:41.385
they'll be treated to that
and dozens just like it.

00:41.386 --> 00:44.011
That's the beauty of the Internet.
It stays with us forever.

00:44.012 --> 00:45.679
What do you want, Sebastian?

00:45.680 --> 00:48.598
I want a guaranteed Regionals win,
so I want you to drop out.

00:48.599 --> 00:50.809
McKinley gets home-court
advantage this year.

00:50.810 --> 00:53.534
You're going to come
down with Asian bird flu

00:53.535 --> 00:55.397
or whatever Tina
Blowing-Wang just had.

00:55.398 --> 00:57.149
But that is show choir
terrorism.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.110
You give a bad name
to the entire gay community.

01:00.111 --> 01:02.192
And you give the gay community
cutting-edge fashion

01:02.193 --> 01:04.912
that's usually only seen
on Puerto Rican pride floats.

01:04.913 --> 01:06.575
I'm sorry... I didn't hear you.

01:06.576 --> 01:08.702
I was distracted
by your giant horse teeth.

01:08.703 --> 01:10.746
You have 24 hours
to drop out, Rachel,

01:10.747 --> 01:12.886
or I press the
upload button.

01:18.629 --> 01:20.511
That's it. I'm done.
I'm leaving this classroom,

01:20.512 --> 01:22.215
and I'm going to beat
that Sebastian kid's ass!

01:22.216 --> 01:24.148
- Finn, chill.
- No, I'm not going to chill.

01:24.149 --> 01:25.969
- I... I'm done chilling.
- The official show choir rule book

01:25.970 --> 01:28.388
states that "any real
or perceived threat of violence,

01:28.389 --> 01:30.474
"vandalism or humiliation
will be met with a swift

01:30.475 --> 01:32.156
"and unquestioned
disqualification

01:32.157 --> 01:33.690
of the threatening party's team
with extreme prejudice."

01:33.691 --> 01:34.728
It's right here.

01:34.729 --> 01:37.981
Page 72, by-law 15,
section six, article 44.

01:37.982 --> 01:39.896
Guys, I contacted
the headmaster of Dalton.

01:39.897 --> 01:40.984
Like you did when Sebastian

01:40.985 --> 01:43.195
almost blinded me?
What did they do then?

01:43.196 --> 01:44.821
Same thing as they're
going to do now... nothing.

01:44.822 --> 01:46.420
Look, none of this
matters now anyways, okay?

01:46.421 --> 01:48.205
We're not going to let him
beat us like this.

01:48.206 --> 01:50.757
- I'm going to perform at Regionals.
- Even if he's going to post

01:50.758 --> 01:52.704
a photo like this
of me if you do?

01:52.705 --> 01:54.289
Finn, I'm not going to negotiate
with terrorists.

01:54.290 --> 01:55.916
If someone posted a picture

01:55.917 --> 01:59.216
like that of me online,
I'd probably kill myself.

01:59.217 --> 02:00.587
Twice to be sure
I was dead.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.136
Look, you guys are just going to have
to deal with things like this.

02:03.137 --> 02:05.467
The more successful you get,
the more garbage

02:05.468 --> 02:06.718
people are going to
make up about you.

02:06.719 --> 02:08.192
They're going to love
to tear you down.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.471
I can't believe
you would do that to me.

02:09.472 --> 02:11.478
I'm going to be
married to you.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.266
Don't you think I'm going to
suffer the consequences as well?

02:13.267 --> 02:15.685
I mean, I just... I don't care
about stuff like that.

02:15.686 --> 02:17.868
I love you, and we'll...
we'll manage this together.

02:17.869 --> 02:20.273
Okay, the important thing
right now is that we win.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.955
So you wouldn't care
if I Photoshopped a photo

02:21.956 --> 02:23.443
of you like this
and put it on the Internet?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.792
Look, our future depends
on us winning Regionals.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.031
It'll help me
towards my NYADA application.

02:28.032 --> 02:29.213
Hmm.

02:29.214 --> 02:30.367
Hope you get in.

02:30.368 --> 02:31.701
Finn.

02:36.588 --> 02:39.751
- You wanted to see me?
- Q, have a seat.

02:39.752 --> 02:42.087
Prepare yourself.

02:42.088 --> 02:44.678
I'm about to drop a bomb on you.

02:48.566 --> 02:51.602
I, Sue Sylvester...

02:51.603 --> 02:53.770
am with child.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.143
Are you serious?

02:59.810 --> 03:01.147
Wow.

03:01.148 --> 03:04.693
Um, that's amazing
and confusing.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.446
- Who's the father?
- Oh, I can't tell you that yet.

03:08.447 --> 03:11.588
But here's the deal.
In order for this zygote

03:11.589 --> 03:13.674
to stay firmly ensconced
in my uterine wall,

03:13.675 --> 03:15.745
my doctor has put me
on bovine hormones

03:15.746 --> 03:18.164
that are making me
extremely nauseous.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.709
They've also given me a
near-superhuman sense of smell.

03:20.710 --> 03:22.266
For instance,
I can tell

03:22.267 --> 03:23.767
that within the last week,
you either enjoyed

03:23.768 --> 03:25.636
a delicious curry
or a hug from Principal Figgins.

03:25.637 --> 03:29.222
Well, you know,
morning sickness is a good sign.

03:29.223 --> 03:31.720
It means that the baby
is developing properly.

03:31.721 --> 03:34.097
Well, it's good for the baby,
not so good for me.

03:34.098 --> 03:37.809
Well, you know, there really
is no cure for morning sickness.

03:37.810 --> 03:40.400
I mean, I ate saltines,

03:40.401 --> 03:43.440
drank herbal tea
and sucked on lollipops.

03:43.441 --> 03:44.955
That helps.

03:44.956 --> 03:46.943
Lollipops?
Yeah.

03:46.944 --> 03:50.460
Weird, but it works.

03:50.461 --> 03:52.162
Well, thank you, Q,

03:52.163 --> 03:54.464
for that condescending tone
and barely helpful advice.

03:58.136 --> 04:00.921
I wanted to ask you a favor,
actually, Coach.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.668
I would love
to rejoin the Cheerios!

04:03.669 --> 04:05.676
I beg your pardon?
It's my senior year,

04:05.677 --> 04:07.210
and I want to finish high school

04:07.211 --> 04:08.673
in a Cheerios! uniform
with a national championship.

04:08.674 --> 04:10.759
I mean,
other than Glee,

04:10.760 --> 04:12.886
this was the rest
of my high school experience.

04:12.887 --> 04:16.403
Well, I'm sorry, Q,
but that wouldn't be fair

04:16.404 --> 04:19.434
to the girls who've been practicing
all year long, who didn't quit.

04:19.435 --> 04:22.909
And if you'll now please
get the hell out of my office.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.661
I just caught a whiff
of hot dog water

04:24.662 --> 04:26.563
wafting in from the cafeteria,

04:26.564 --> 04:29.194
and I think I'm going to blow
some serious chunks.

04:29.195 --> 04:31.118
Excuse me.

04:38.009 --> 04:40.877
You okay?
You seemed upset.

04:42.123 --> 04:44.584
- And if Sebastian thinks...
- Forget about Sebastian!

04:44.585 --> 04:46.717
I'm not mad at
you. I just...

04:46.718 --> 04:48.802
don't want to waste
any more time on him.

04:48.803 --> 04:51.254
I-I want to focus on winning.

04:52.591 --> 04:54.424
I've got a new song
I want to try out.

04:54.425 --> 04:55.776
The theme for Regionals
is "Inspiration,"

04:55.777 --> 04:57.973
and I think this fits the bill.
You want to hear it?

04:59.000 --> 05:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:07.555 --> 05:08.984
Hey, Karofsky.

05:08.985 --> 05:10.941
What's up, Nick?

05:36.093 --> 05:39.014
â™ª Life's too short
to even care at all â™ª

05:39.015 --> 05:40.193
â™ª Whoa â™ª

05:40.194 --> 05:41.433
That's terrible.

05:43.397 --> 05:45.915
â™ª I'm losing my mind,
losing my mind â™ª

05:45.916 --> 05:49.669
â™ª Losing control â™ª

05:49.670 --> 05:51.985
- You want to go? Huh?
- â™ª These fishes in the sea â™ª

05:51.986 --> 05:54.779
- â™ª They're staring at me, whoa â™ª
- Homo.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.991
â™ª Whoa â™ª

05:57.992 --> 06:00.744
â™ª Wet world aches
for a beat of a drum â™ª

06:00.745 --> 06:03.249
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

06:05.122 --> 06:08.585
â™ª If I could find a way
to see this straight â™ª

06:08.586 --> 06:10.573
â™ª I'd run away â™ª

06:10.574 --> 06:13.840
â™ª To some fortune that I â™ª

06:13.841 --> 06:19.315
â™ª Should have found by now â™ª

06:19.316 --> 06:23.516
â™ª I'm waiting
for this cough syrup â™ª

06:23.517 --> 06:27.812
â™ª To come down â™ª
â™ª Come down â™ª

06:42.993 --> 06:46.498
â™ª Life's too short
to even care at all â™ª

06:46.499 --> 06:47.894
â™ª Whoa â™ª

06:50.918 --> 06:53.016
â™ª I'm coming up now,
coming up now â™ª

06:53.017 --> 06:54.589
â™ª Out of the blue â™ª

06:54.590 --> 06:56.674
â™ª Oh â™ª

06:56.675 --> 06:59.761
â™ª These zombies in the park â™ª

06:59.762 --> 07:01.407
â™ª They're looking
for my heart â™ª

07:01.408 --> 07:04.099
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

07:04.100 --> 07:07.811
â™ª A dark world aches
for a splash of the sun â™ª

07:07.812 --> 07:11.189
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

07:11.190 --> 07:15.151
â™ª If I could find a way
to see this straight â™ª

07:15.152 --> 07:17.362
â™ª I'd run away â™ª

07:17.363 --> 07:20.115
â™ª To some fortune that I â™ª

07:20.116 --> 07:24.786
â™ª Should have found by now â™ª

07:24.787 --> 07:29.352
â™ª And so I run now to the things
they said could restore me â™ª

07:29.353 --> 07:33.139
â™ª Restore life
the way it should be â™ª

07:33.140 --> 07:37.298
â™ª I'm waiting
for this cough syrup â™ª

07:37.299 --> 07:42.804
â™ª To come down â™ª

07:42.805 --> 07:45.618
â™ª One more spoon
of cough syrup now â™ª

07:45.619 --> 07:47.403
â™ª Whoa â™ª

07:49.790 --> 07:52.858
â™ª One more spoon
of cough syrup now â™ª

07:52.859 --> 07:55.078
â™ª Whoa â™ª

07:55.079 --> 07:57.318
â™ª Oh. â™ª

08:03.949 --> 08:06.494
We have to be
very careful about how

08:06.495 --> 08:08.496
we deliver the news of this
to the student body.

08:08.497 --> 08:10.066
David was part
of this community,

08:10.067 --> 08:12.208
and he still has
many friends here.

08:12.209 --> 08:15.795
And my understanding
is that these teen suicides...

08:15.796 --> 08:20.175
or even attempts like David's...
can induce a string of copycats.

08:20.176 --> 08:21.342
It's just so senseless.

08:21.343 --> 08:23.303
Facebook,
Twitter, Tumblr.

08:23.304 --> 08:25.096
The pressure to protect
your reputation

08:25.097 --> 08:26.639
is so much worse
than when we were kids.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.267
Yeah, and these people
can sling their hatred

08:29.268 --> 08:30.477
and their mud
anonymously.

08:32.186 --> 08:33.640
Sue, are you crying?

08:34.859 --> 08:37.734
- Hormones.
- No, it's not hormones.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.764
I could have done more.

08:40.765 --> 08:43.198
I was principal when Dave
was having his trouble

08:43.198 --> 08:44.949
with Porcelain, and...

08:44.950 --> 08:47.404
I knew there was something
up with that kid. I knew it.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.748
All I can think of
is his dad finding him.

08:51.749 --> 08:54.494
Get some help! David, no!
Buddy, come on.

08:54.495 --> 08:55.919
David!

08:57.332 --> 08:59.339
And that feeling.

08:59.340 --> 09:01.301
Guys, we were all hard on Dave.

09:01.302 --> 09:03.551
We thought he
was going to hurt Kurt.

09:03.552 --> 09:06.971
I just never thought
he'd hurt himself.

09:06.972 --> 09:10.266
- It wasn't our job to know.
- Then whose job was it?

09:13.812 --> 09:15.315
We should start today's meeting

09:15.316 --> 09:17.565
by praying for Karofsky.

09:17.566 --> 09:20.485
That he finds peace and
that he feels better.

09:20.486 --> 09:22.028
I think we should
start today's meeting

09:22.029 --> 09:23.279
by praying for his family.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.615
They could use comfort
more than he could.

09:25.616 --> 09:26.950
I just don't understand how

09:26.951 --> 09:29.160
he could get to such
a horrible, dark place.

09:29.161 --> 09:30.411
It's all over Facebook.

09:30.412 --> 09:33.867
A couple of kids from
Karofsky's new school

09:33.868 --> 09:36.626
saw him at Breadstix with
Kurt on Valentine's Day.

09:36.627 --> 09:38.503
They posted mean
stuff on his page

09:38.504 --> 09:40.290
and texted everyone
that he was gay.

09:41.492 --> 09:44.259
- He couldn't take it.
- How is he?

09:44.260 --> 09:46.496
- Is he going to live?
- Well, he's in the hospital,

09:46.497 --> 09:48.471
but thank God his dad
found him in time.

09:48.472 --> 09:50.932
I feel sorry for Karofsky,

09:50.933 --> 09:53.393
but what he did
was selfish.

09:53.394 --> 09:55.395
He didn't just want to hurt
himself; he wanted to hurt

09:55.396 --> 09:56.604
everyone around him.

09:56.605 --> 09:59.009
I went through the wringer,
but I never

09:59.010 --> 10:00.566
- got to that place.
- Quinn, please.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.447
Sure, you had a baby
when you were 16

10:03.448 --> 10:06.072
and you had a bad dye job
for two weeks,

10:06.073 --> 10:08.950
but seriously? The world never
stopped loving you.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.994
And you're
going to Yale.

10:10.995 --> 10:13.037
You have no idea what Karofsky
was struggling with.

10:13.038 --> 10:15.039
You really want to try
to compare...

10:15.040 --> 10:17.500
The despair, the
self-loathing.

10:17.501 --> 10:18.918
It doesn't matter.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.548
I just can't imagine things
getting so messed-up

10:21.549 --> 10:23.631
that you would consider
taking your own life.

10:23.632 --> 10:26.136
That is so harsh and reductive.

10:26.137 --> 10:27.552
Have some compassion.

10:27.553 --> 10:30.179
Do you know what they're still
writing on his Facebook?

10:30.180 --> 10:32.765
"Better luck next time"
and "Try, try again."

10:32.766 --> 10:33.933
Why are you even
here, Kurt?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.762
Thought you didn't
believe in God.

10:37.682 --> 10:40.231
He asked me if he could come,
and I invited him.

10:40.232 --> 10:45.155
I heard you guys were praying
for Karofsky, and...

10:45.156 --> 10:47.223
after everything
that we've been through,

10:47.224 --> 10:49.392
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

10:55.579 --> 10:57.868
I feel responsible.

10:59.921 --> 11:03.757
He asked me out, and...

11:03.758 --> 11:05.048
I said no.

11:08.050 --> 11:09.052
And he kept calling me...

11:12.262 --> 11:14.807
<i>If I'd just answered one
of those stupid calls...</i>

11:18.589 --> 11:21.147
We're taking a edible
arrangement to the hospital.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.528
Do you want to come with us?

11:31.819 --> 11:32.825
I'm so sorry.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.938
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

11:38.042 --> 11:40.124
Look, I've been thinking
about what Dave did,

11:40.125 --> 11:41.918
and I just want you to know
that there's nothing

11:41.919 --> 11:45.499
that anybody could do and there's
nothing that anybody could say about me

11:45.500 --> 11:47.173
that would make me
want to do that.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.753
Good, 'cause I don't ever want
to be without you.

11:51.593 --> 11:54.931
So, I'm not gonna
perform at Regionals.

11:54.932 --> 11:57.511
You have to. Look, I don't care
about these pictures.

11:57.512 --> 11:59.312
I don't care about what anybody
says about me...

11:59.313 --> 12:00.463
except for you.

12:08.193 --> 12:09.987
Life's too short.

12:09.988 --> 12:11.906
- What?
- Look, I don't want to wait

12:11.907 --> 12:14.411
for some arbitrary date
to start living it, I...

12:14.412 --> 12:16.863
I want to get married.

12:16.864 --> 12:18.121
Now.

12:18.122 --> 12:19.622
I have gym.
No, it's Saturday.

12:19.623 --> 12:22.041
After we win Regionals.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.584
Seriously?

12:23.585 --> 12:25.294
Yeah.
Awesome!

12:27.324 --> 12:28.756
But wait, what...

12:28.757 --> 12:30.127
what if we lose?

12:30.128 --> 12:32.295
Well, I thought we agreed
that I was singing.

12:40.638 --> 12:44.605
Let me break it down for you,
from one bitch to another.

12:44.606 --> 12:46.107
All this vicious,
underhanded crap

12:46.108 --> 12:47.900
has got to stop.
Exactly.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.110
That's why
I called you here.

12:49.111 --> 12:50.697
First of all...

12:50.698 --> 12:52.649
Blaine,
I am sorry about your eye.

12:52.650 --> 12:53.656
That means
nothing to me.

12:53.657 --> 12:55.908
Just give me a chance.
I have no excuses,

12:55.909 --> 13:00.371
other than a lame prank got
completely out of control.

13:00.372 --> 13:02.790
Second, the Finn photos have
all been destroyed.

13:02.791 --> 13:05.084
I want the Warblers
to win fair and square.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.030
And we're gonna take donations

13:07.031 --> 13:08.504
for Lady Gaga's Born This Way
Foundation.

13:08.505 --> 13:10.083
Win, lose or draw,

13:10.084 --> 13:13.092
we're gonna dedicate our
performance to Dave Karofsky.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.678
I thought you might
want to join us.

13:15.679 --> 13:17.847
Wait for the punch,
you know it's coming.

13:17.848 --> 13:19.926
No, not this time.

13:19.927 --> 13:25.855
For too long I have treated
everything like a big joke.

13:25.856 --> 13:28.735
So, how do you get
a guy to like you?

13:28.736 --> 13:31.404
You, get a guy? Please.

13:31.405 --> 13:34.057
Why, what's wrong with me?

13:34.058 --> 13:36.824
First off, you're about
100 pounds overweight.

13:37.361 --> 13:40.244
Quit waxing your eyebrows.
You look like Liberace.

13:40.245 --> 13:43.915
In fact, just stay in
the closet, buddy.

13:46.037 --> 13:48.255
It's all fun and games...

13:48.256 --> 13:49.295
until it's not.

13:52.176 --> 13:55.468
Mr. Shue, why do you have a jar
of peanut butter with one spoon?

13:55.469 --> 13:56.886
Yeah, there are 15 of us here,

13:56.887 --> 13:58.748
and I'm only comfortable

13:58.749 --> 14:01.098
sharing a spoon
with about half of you.

14:01.099 --> 14:02.519
Well, it's come to my attention

14:02.520 --> 14:04.685
that our good friend Rory Flanagan
has never tasted peanut butter.

14:04.686 --> 14:06.979
- What?!
- Are you serious?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.189
- No way.
- It's not possible.

14:08.190 --> 14:09.926
Rory, if you don't mind.

14:13.114 --> 14:14.597
Oh, God...

14:18.031 --> 14:20.070
Oh, my God...

14:20.071 --> 14:21.452
That's the best thing
I've ever had.

14:22.704 --> 14:28.584
Mr. Shuester, wow, that's
incredibly moving,

14:28.585 --> 14:30.294
Yeah, Mr. Shue,
what's the point of all this?

14:30.295 --> 14:32.004
The point is

14:32.005 --> 14:33.416
Rory just had
a brand-new experience,

14:33.417 --> 14:35.091
something as simple
as peanut butter.

14:35.092 --> 14:36.259
You guys are young.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.172
I want you to promise me

14:39.173 --> 14:41.430
that, no matter
how depressed you get,

14:41.431 --> 14:44.811
no matter how hopeless or alone
you feel,

14:44.812 --> 14:49.099
you'll try your best to imagine
all of the amazing experiences

14:49.100 --> 14:50.398
you have ahead of you.

14:50.399 --> 14:51.968
Mr. Shue, look,
I know we're

14:51.969 --> 14:55.778
a little dramatic sometimes,
but I don't think

14:55.779 --> 14:58.114
anyone will ever consider taking
their own life.

14:58.115 --> 15:00.777
I did.

15:01.950 --> 15:03.744
Junior year.

15:03.745 --> 15:06.866
That was a tough year.

15:06.867 --> 15:09.166
I, uh, I cheated on
my math midterm.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.821
Peeked at the answers
of the guy next to me and...

15:11.822 --> 15:13.796
the teacher saw me do it.

15:13.797 --> 15:15.125
Just 'cause you got caught
cheating?

15:15.126 --> 15:16.632
I get caught cheating
all the time.

15:16.633 --> 15:20.930
They called my dad
at his office,

15:20.931 --> 15:23.366
and he was coming
to pick me up.

15:24.602 --> 15:26.601
How was I supposed
to look him in the eye?

15:27.350 --> 15:32.565
I just kept...
cturing my dad

15:32.566 --> 15:36.746
so disappointed in me.

15:38.515 --> 15:41.368
So... I walked up to the roof.

15:43.283 --> 15:44.537
I went right to the edge.

15:47.287 --> 15:50.794
One step and all the pain and
humiliation would be over.

15:52.876 --> 15:54.045
Is that true?

15:54.046 --> 15:57.500
That day, I promise you,

15:57.501 --> 15:59.425
it felt like it was
the end of the world.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.470
But you know what?

16:02.471 --> 16:04.597
It wasn't.

16:04.598 --> 16:07.977
You know, for some of you,
getting caught cheating

16:07.978 --> 16:09.312
isn't a big deal.

16:09.313 --> 16:14.517
But there's something...

16:14.518 --> 16:17.737
everyone has something

16:17.738 --> 16:20.446
that might take them up
to that edge.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.726
And look at all the things
I would've missed out on.

16:23.727 --> 16:26.229
I would've never met you guys
or Emma.

16:26.230 --> 16:29.955
I would've missed out
on everything.

16:29.956 --> 16:34.293
So, right now, I want you all
to think of something that

16:34.294 --> 16:35.711
you're looking
forward to.

16:35.712 --> 16:38.172
Big things.

16:38.173 --> 16:39.674
Someday, I want to earn

16:39.675 --> 16:41.258
enough money to buy
my folks a new place,

16:41.259 --> 16:42.512
so they don't ever
have to go through

16:42.513 --> 16:43.719
losing their home again.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.887
I'm most looking forward

16:44.888 --> 16:46.889
to meeting Rachel
Berry's children.

16:49.726 --> 16:51.978
I want to be there to see
my kid's first steps.

16:51.979 --> 16:54.021
I want to be there to see
<i>Sex and the City Part III.</i>

16:54.022 --> 16:56.190
Wow.

16:56.191 --> 16:57.760
I'm sort of
embarrassed to admit it,

16:57.761 --> 16:59.485
but I really do want
to graduate high school.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.696
I'm gonna petition
the Army to change

17:01.697 --> 17:04.406
my dad's dishonorable discharge
status to an honorable one.

17:04.407 --> 17:05.617
I'm looking forward
to graduating

17:05.618 --> 17:07.159
from Yale
at the top of my class.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.037
I'm looking forward to the day
when my grandmother loves me again.

17:10.038 --> 17:12.123
I want Lord Tubbington to kick
his Ecstasy addiction.

17:12.124 --> 17:15.667
I am looking forward to marriage
equality in all 50 states.

17:15.669 --> 17:18.253
I'm looking forward to the first
time I dance at Carnegie Hall.

17:18.255 --> 17:19.505
I just want a song.

17:21.215 --> 17:23.752
I'm looking forward to
watching my dad make

17:23.753 --> 17:25.051
a difference in Congress.

17:25.053 --> 17:26.679
I'm looking forward to being
friends with all of you

17:26.680 --> 17:28.723
for the rest of my life.

17:28.724 --> 17:30.293
I know this sounds silly,

17:30.294 --> 17:31.561
and the peanut butter really
is amazing, Mr. Shue,

17:31.562 --> 17:32.768
but do you know what
I'm looking forward to?

17:32.769 --> 17:35.062
Winning at Regionals.

17:39.566 --> 17:42.445
And now,
let's meet our judges

17:42.446 --> 17:44.155
for the 2012 Midwest Regionals!

17:44.156 --> 17:47.067
Deputy Zoning Commissioner
Melba Jackson-Wright!

17:47.068 --> 17:50.161
President of the Ohio Plumbers
Union Local 109,

17:50.162 --> 17:52.205
Mr. Harl Beindorf!

17:52.206 --> 17:54.524
And Central Ohio's number one
late-night horror movie host...

17:54.525 --> 17:56.692
- No...
- Svengoobles!

18:03.423 --> 18:06.135
And now, from Westerville, Ohio,
the Dalton Academy Warblers!

18:07.955 --> 18:12.542
â™ª Come on and stand â™ª
â™ª <i>Come on, stand</i> â™ª

18:12.543 --> 18:16.395
â™ª Up again â™ª
â™ª <i>Why don't you stand?</i> â™ª

18:16.680 --> 18:21.442
â™ª Stand,
you're gonna run again â™ª

18:21.718 --> 18:24.528
â™ª Don't give up,
you're gonna see tomorrow â™ª

18:24.822 --> 18:27.607
â™ª That you'll be on
your feet again â™ª

18:29.326 --> 18:33.037
â™ª Sometimes the world's gonna
knock you over â™ª

18:33.038 --> 18:35.998
â™ª But you will see
who are your friends â™ª

18:36.873 --> 18:39.752
â™ª Come on and stand â™ª
â™ª <i>Come on, stand</i> â™ª

18:39.753 --> 18:44.048
â™ª Up again â™ª

18:44.049 --> 18:47.802
â™ª Come on and stand â™ª

18:49.380 --> 18:52.473
â™ª Stand,
you're gonna run again â™ª

18:52.749 --> 18:57.103
â™ª You have the power
to face your demons â™ª

18:57.104 --> 18:59.647
â™ª No matter how
they go on time â™ª

18:59.648 --> 19:03.560
Why are you cheering
your competition?

19:03.561 --> 19:04.927
Life's too short.

19:04.928 --> 19:06.062
You should try it.

19:06.063 --> 19:07.730
Come on.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.656
Get up!

19:08.657 --> 19:10.733
â™ª Come on, stand â™ª

19:10.734 --> 19:12.034
â™ª Come on, baby â™ª

19:12.436 --> 19:14.537
â™ª Come on, stand â™ª
â™ª <i>Come on, stand</i> â™ª

19:14.538 --> 19:16.038
â™ª Stand, yeah â™ª

19:16.039 --> 19:18.332
â™ª Come on, stand â™ª

19:18.333 --> 19:20.460
â™ª You can make it â™ª

19:20.461 --> 19:25.832
â™ª Come on, stand,
you're gonna run again â™ª

19:25.833 --> 19:28.843
â™ª Pick up your will
and put on your face â™ª

19:29.119 --> 19:33.006
â™ª If you need to,
just take my hand â™ª

19:33.007 --> 19:36.643
â™ª It's time to demonstrate,
don't hesitate â™ª

19:36.644 --> 19:41.897
â™ª Just get up and say,
"Yes, I can" â™ª

19:42.299 --> 19:44.900
â™ª <i>You just stand</i> â™ª
â™ª Come on, baby â™ª

19:45.269 --> 19:46.819
â™ª Stand â™ª
<i>â™ª You need to stand â™ª</i>

19:46.820 --> 19:49.029
â™ª Stand, yeah! â™ª

19:49.440 --> 19:52.575
â™ª <i>Come on, stand</i> â™ª
â™ª Come on, you can make it â™ª

19:52.576 --> 19:55.661
â™ª Come on, stand
you're gonna run again. â™ª

20:02.125 --> 20:03.503
Thank you.

20:03.504 --> 20:05.371
Just a reminder
to please make a donation

20:05.372 --> 20:07.373
to one of our charity baskets.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.125
We're set up all around
the auditorium.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.826
Just look for the Dalton blazer.

20:10.827 --> 20:13.296
Please... give what you can.

20:14.682 --> 20:16.299
â™ª Ooh... â™ª

20:16.300 --> 20:19.101
â™ª The sun goes down,
the stars come out â™ª

20:19.102 --> 20:23.856
â™ª And all that counts
is here and now â™ª

20:24.141 --> 20:28.235
â™ª My universe
will never be the same â™ª

20:28.236 --> 20:30.487
â™ª I'm glad you came... â™ª

20:34.157 --> 20:35.659
â™ª Ba-ba, la-ah, oh-oh â™ª

20:35.660 --> 20:37.703
â™ª Da-da, da, oh-oh â™ª

20:37.704 --> 20:39.955
â™ª Da-da, la, oh-oh â™ª

20:39.956 --> 20:41.165
â™ª Da-da-da, do-do, oh-oh â™ª

20:41.166 --> 20:43.709
â™ª Da-da-da, la, la-la â™ª

20:43.710 --> 20:45.461
â™ª Da-da, da, do-da-do-da â™ª

20:45.462 --> 20:48.422
â™ª Da-da-da, la, la-la â™ª

20:48.423 --> 20:50.507
â™ª You cast a spell on me,
spell on me â™ª

20:50.801 --> 20:54.504
â™ª You hit me like the sky
fell on me, fell on me â™ª

20:54.505 --> 20:58.098
â™ª And I decided you look
well on me, well on me â™ª

20:58.099 --> 21:01.094
â™ª So let's go somewhere
no one else can see â™ª

21:01.095 --> 21:02.102
â™ª You and me â™ª

21:02.103 --> 21:04.021
â™ª Turn the lights out now â™ª

21:04.315 --> 21:06.516
â™ª Now I'll take you
by the hand â™ª

21:06.517 --> 21:10.277
â™ª Hand you another drink,
drink it if you can â™ª

21:10.278 --> 21:12.571
â™ª Can you spend a little time? â™ª

21:13.238 --> 21:15.024
â™ª Time is slipping away,
away from us â™ª

21:15.025 --> 21:19.536
â™ª So stay, stay with me I can
make, make you glad you came â™ª

21:19.830 --> 21:23.540
â™ª The sun goes down,
the stars come out â™ª

21:23.834 --> 21:26.585
â™ª And all that counts
is here and now â™ª

21:26.870 --> 21:30.923
â™ª My universe will never be
the same â™ª

21:31.208 --> 21:34.627
â™ª I'm glad you came,
I'm glad you came â™ª

21:34.628 --> 21:38.305
â™ª Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh â™ª

21:38.306 --> 21:39.848
â™ª Oh-oh-oh â™ª

21:39.849 --> 21:41.558
â™ª Turn the lights out now â™ª

21:41.852 --> 21:44.687
â™ª Now I'll take you
by the hand â™ª

21:44.688 --> 21:46.255
â™ª And you will never drink â™ª

21:46.256 --> 21:48.257
â™ª Drink â™ª
â™ª Drink it if you can â™ª

21:48.258 --> 21:49.984
â™ª Can â™ª
â™ª Spend a little time â™ª

21:49.985 --> 21:52.111
â™ª Time is slipping away â™ª

21:52.112 --> 21:55.698
â™ª Away from us, so stay â™ª
â™ª Stay with me, I can make â™ª

21:55.699 --> 21:57.199
â™ª Make you glad you came â™ª

21:57.200 --> 21:59.786
â™ª The sunoes down â™ª

21:59.787 --> 22:01.996
â™ª The stars come out â™ª

22:01.997 --> 22:03.323
â™ª And all that counts â™ª

22:03.324 --> 22:04.957
â™ª Is here and now â™ª

22:04.958 --> 22:06.542
â™ª My universe â™ª

22:06.543 --> 22:08.836
â™ª Will never be the same â™ª

22:08.837 --> 22:10.946
â™ª I'm glad you came â™ª

22:10.947 --> 22:12.881
â™ª I'm glad you came... â™ª

22:12.882 --> 22:14.717
â™ª <i>Whoa-oa-oa...</i> â™ª

22:14.718 --> 22:16.635
â™ª <i>Whoa-oa-oa â™ª</i>

22:16.636 --> 22:18.504
â™ª <i>Whoa-oa-oa...</i> â™ª

22:18.505 --> 22:20.640
â™ª I'm glad you came â™ª

22:20.641 --> 22:22.291
â™ª <i>Whoa-oa-a â™ª</i>

22:22.292 --> 22:24.852
â™ª I'm glad you came â™ª

22:25.262 --> 22:27.021
â™ª <i>Whoa-oa-oa</i> â™ª
â™ª Oh, oh, oh â™ª

22:27.022 --> 22:29.815
â™ª The sun goes down â™ª

22:29.816 --> 22:31.967
â™ª The stars come out â™ª

22:31.968 --> 22:33.986
â™ª And all that counts â™ª

22:33.987 --> 22:35.772
â™ª Is here and now â™ª

22:35.773 --> 22:38.032
â™ª My universe â™ª

22:38.033 --> 22:40.109
â™ª Will never be the same â™ª

22:40.110 --> 22:41.827
â™ª I'm glad you came â™ª

22:41.828 --> 22:45.080
â™ª I'm glad you came. â™ª

22:54.041 --> 22:57.301
And now, from Our Lady
of Perpetual Sorrow High School,

22:57.795 --> 22:59.862
the Golden Goblets!

22:59.863 --> 23:03.549
â™ª Where thoughts â™ª

23:03.550 --> 23:09.549
â™ª Serenely sweet express â™ª

23:11.648 --> 23:15.819
â™ª She walks in beauty... â™ª

23:15.820 --> 23:18.405
â™ª <i>Beauty...</i> â™ª

23:18.406 --> 23:20.516
Those Golden Goblet madrigal
singers were way better

23:20.517 --> 23:22.068
than I thought they'd be.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.519
Are you high? I couldn't hear
their instruments at all.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.787
All right, guys, listen up.

23:24.788 --> 23:26.322
Don't let them get
into your heads, okay?

23:26.323 --> 23:27.957
Stay focused on what we do best.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.525
Show circle time,
come on, let's huddle up!

23:32.919 --> 23:34.129
Okay, uh...

23:34.415 --> 23:35.923
- Oh, Finn, you wanted to start us off?
- Yeah.

23:35.924 --> 23:37.508
I know it's kind of
short notice, but...

23:37.509 --> 23:40.002
after the competition,

23:40.003 --> 23:41.845
Rachel and I are going
to get married.

23:41.846 --> 23:43.806
At the Justice of the Peace,
at the Lima Municipal Center.

23:43.807 --> 23:45.591
There will be some light
refreshments afterwards,

23:45.592 --> 23:46.893
My dads and I were

23:46.894 --> 23:48.018
rolling finger sandwiches
all night long.

23:48.019 --> 23:50.596
With everything
that's happened lately,

23:50.597 --> 23:53.023
we thought a lot about
what Mr. Shue said.

23:53.024 --> 23:55.067
We didn't want
to wait anymore.

23:55.068 --> 23:58.320
We just want to live
every day like it's our last.

23:58.321 --> 24:00.440
So we wanted to thank a lot of
you guys that were supportive

24:00.441 --> 24:02.574
of our decision to get married.
And-and for those of you

24:02.575 --> 24:04.894
who maybe weren't the biggest
fans of our impending nuptials,

24:04.895 --> 24:06.299
we thank you also.

24:07.870 --> 24:09.081
So after we win,
we would really love it

24:09.082 --> 24:11.291
if all of you would
come to our wedding.

24:13.336 --> 24:14.503
Come on, bring it in!

24:14.504 --> 24:17.089
A... mazing!

24:19.116 --> 24:22.136
â™ª I came to win â™ª

24:22.137 --> 24:23.762
â™ª To fight â™ª

24:23.763 --> 24:25.722
â™ª To conquer â™ª

24:25.723 --> 24:27.049
â™ª To thrive â™ª

24:27.050 --> 24:29.835
â™ª I came to win â™ª

24:29.836 --> 24:31.837
â™ª To survive â™ª

24:31.838 --> 24:33.522
â™ª To prosper â™ª

24:33.523 --> 24:35.774
â™ª To rise â™ª

24:35.775 --> 24:41.630
â™ª To fly... â™ª

24:43.906 --> 24:47.936
â™ª To fly... â™ª

24:49.454 --> 24:51.498
â™ª Uh... Yo... Yo... â™ª

24:51.499 --> 24:55.043
â™ª I used to think
that I could not â™ª

24:55.361 --> 24:57.813
â™ª Go on... â™ª
â™ª I wish today, it would rain all day â™ª

24:57.814 --> 25:00.007
â™ª Maybe that would kind of
make the pain go away â™ª

25:00.008 --> 25:03.635
â™ª And life was nothing
but an awful song... â™ª

25:03.636 --> 25:05.179
â™ª They got they guns out,
aimin' at me â™ª

25:05.180 --> 25:07.556
â™ª But I become near
when they aimin' at me â™ª

25:07.557 --> 25:09.516
â™ª Me, me, me against them â™ª

25:09.517 --> 25:11.560
â™ª Me against enemies,
me against friends â™ª

25:11.561 --> 25:13.562
â™ª Somehow they both
seem to become one â™ª

25:13.563 --> 25:15.355
â™ª A sea full of sharks,
and they all smell blood â™ª

25:15.356 --> 25:17.516
â™ª They start coming
and I start rising â™ª

25:17.517 --> 25:19.318
â™ª Must be surprising,
I'm just surmising â™ª

25:19.319 --> 25:21.278
â™ª I win, thrive, soar, higher â™ª

25:21.279 --> 25:23.363
â™ª Higher, higher, more fire â™ª

25:23.364 --> 25:24.990
â™ª I came to win â™ª

25:24.991 --> 25:26.408
â™ª To fight â™ª

25:26.409 --> 25:28.535
â™ª To conquer â™ª

25:28.536 --> 25:29.945
â™ª To thrive â™ª

25:29.946 --> 25:31.914
â™ª I came to win â™ª

25:31.915 --> 25:34.500
â™ª To survive â™ª

25:34.501 --> 25:36.535
â™ª To prosper â™ª

25:36.536 --> 25:38.019
â™ª To rise â™ª

25:38.419 --> 25:41.965
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª
â™ª <i>To fly...</i> â™ª

25:41.966 --> 25:44.134
â™ª I believe
I can touch the sky â™ª

25:44.135 --> 25:45.594
â™ª <i>Ohh...</i> â™ª

25:45.912 --> 25:49.014
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª
â™ª <i>Fly...</i> â™ª

25:49.015 --> 25:53.060
â™ª I believe I can
touch the sky â™ª

25:53.061 --> 25:55.871
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª

25:55.872 --> 25:57.806
â™ª <i>Get ready for it</i> â™ª

25:57.807 --> 26:01.652
â™ª <i>Get ready for it</i> â™ª
â™ª When I can be it â™ª

26:01.978 --> 26:05.197
â™ª If I just believe it â™ª
â™ª <i>Get ready for it</i> â™ª

26:05.548 --> 26:07.908
â™ª <i>Get ready for it</i> â™ª
â™ª There's nothing to it â™ª

26:07.909 --> 26:09.885
â™ª Get ready for it â™ª

26:09.886 --> 26:13.664
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª
â™ª <i>Fly...</i> â™ª

26:13.665 --> 26:17.000
â™ª I believe
I can touch the sky â™ª

26:17.001 --> 26:20.379
â™ª I think about it
every night and day â™ª

26:20.380 --> 26:25.217
â™ª Spread my wings and fly away â™ª

26:25.218 --> 26:26.760
â™ª I believe I can soar â™ª

26:26.761 --> 26:28.220
â™ª Get ready for it â™ª

26:28.221 --> 26:30.430
â™ª Get ready for it â™ª
â™ª I see me running â™ª

26:30.431 --> 26:32.182
â™ª Through that open door â™ª

26:32.183 --> 26:33.809
â™ª Fly... â™ª

26:34.127 --> 26:36.311
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª
â™ª <i>Fly...</i> â™ª

26:36.312 --> 26:37.913
â™ª Get ready for it â™ª

26:37.914 --> 26:40.399
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª

26:40.400 --> 26:44.778
â™ª I believe I can fly. â™ª

26:49.943 --> 26:52.536
Come on!
Ohh... wah!

27:00.209 --> 27:03.380
â™ª You know the bed
feels warmer â™ª

27:03.381 --> 27:06.241
â™ª Sleeping here alone â™ª

27:08.342 --> 27:11.263
â™ª You know I dream in color â™ª

27:11.264 --> 27:16.560
â™ª And do the things I want â™ª

27:16.561 --> 27:18.887
â™ª You think you got
the best of me â™ª

27:18.888 --> 27:20.422
â™ª Think you had the last laugh â™ª

27:20.423 --> 27:22.758
â™ª Bet you think
that everything â™ª

27:22.759 --> 27:24.443
â™ª Good is gone â™ª

27:24.444 --> 27:27.404
â™ª Think you left me
broken down â™ª

27:27.405 --> 27:29.156
â™ª Think that I'd
come running back â™ª

27:29.157 --> 27:31.116
â™ª Baby, you don't know me â™ª

27:31.117 --> 27:32.826
â™ª 'Cause you're dead wrong â™ª

27:32.827 --> 27:35.829
â™ª What doesn't kill you

27:35.830 --> 27:38.457
â™ª Stand a little taller â™ª

27:38.458 --> 27:40.000
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm lonely â™ª

27:44.213 --> 27:46.006
â™ª Footsteps even lighter â™ª

27:46.007 --> 27:47.816

28:08.653 --> 28:12.240
â™ª Thanks to you
I got a new thing started â™ª

28:12.241 --> 28:16.536
â™ª Thanks to you I'm not
the broken-hearted â™ª

28:16.537 --> 28:20.032
â™ª Thanks to you
I'm finally thinking 'bout me â™ª

28:20.033 --> 28:21.541
â™ª You know in the end â™ª

28:21.542 --> 28:22.876
â™ª The day you left â™ª

28:22.877 --> 28:25.353
â™ª Was just my beginning â™ª

28:27.421 --> 28:31.051
â™ª In the end... â™ª

28:31.052 --> 28:34.046
â™ª What doesn't kill you

29:05.361 --> 29:07.228
â™ª Not alone. â™ª

29:25.798 --> 29:28.934
â™ª We could just
go home right now â™ª

29:28.935 --> 29:31.770
â™ª Or maybe we could
stick around â™ª

29:31.771 --> 29:34.689
â™ª For just one more drink â™ª

29:34.690 --> 29:35.891
â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

29:38.075 --> 29:40.620
â™ª Get another bottle out â™ª

â™ª Let's shoot the breeze â™ª

29:42.206 --> 29:43.815
â™ª Sit back down â™ª

29:43.816 --> 29:46.618
â™ª For just one more drink â™ª

29:46.619 --> 29:47.986
â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

29:49.670 --> 29:52.132
â™ª Here's to us,
here's to love â™ª

29:52.133 --> 29:55.218
â™ª All the times

29:55.219 --> 29:56.761
â™ª Here's to you â™ª

29:56.762 --> 29:58.630
â™ª Fill the glass â™ª

29:58.631 --> 30:01.099
â™ª 'Cause the last few days
have gone too fast â™ª

30:01.100 --> 30:04.419
â™ª So let's give 'em hell â™ª

30:04.420 --> 30:07.147
â™ª Wish everybody well â™ª

30:07.148 --> 30:08.590
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

30:09.842 --> 30:11.626
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

30:13.444 --> 30:16.823
â™ª We stuck it out
this far together â™ª

30:16.824 --> 30:20.185
â™ª Put our dreams
through the shredder â™ª

30:20.186 --> 30:23.939
â™ª Let's toast,
'cause things got better â™ª

30:26.308 --> 30:28.493
â™ª And everything
could change like that â™ª

30:29.543 --> 30:31.588
â™ª And all these years
go by so fast â™ª

30:31.589 --> 30:35.917
â™ª But nothing lasts forever â™ª

30:37.319 --> 30:39.930
â™ª Here's to us,
here's to love â™ª

30:39.931 --> 30:43.592
â™ª All the times

30:43.593 --> 30:46.353
â™ª Here's to you,
fill the glass â™ª

30:46.354 --> 30:49.481
â™ª 'Cause the last few nights
have gone too fast â™ª

30:49.482 --> 30:52.192
â™ª If they give you hell â™ª

30:52.193 --> 30:55.195
â™ª Tell them forget themselves â™ª

30:55.196 --> 30:57.105
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

30:58.224 --> 31:01.193
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

31:01.194 --> 31:02.894
â™ª Here's to all that we kissed â™ª

31:02.895 --> 31:04.454
â™ª And to all that we missed â™ª

31:04.455 --> 31:07.832
â™ª To the biggest mistakes that
we just just wouldn't trade â™ª

31:07.833 --> 31:10.735
â™ª To us breakin' out,
without us breakin' down â™ª

31:10.736 --> 31:12.988
â™ª To whatever's comin' our way â™ª

31:12.989 --> 31:14.990
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

31:14.991 --> 31:19.578
â™ª Here's to us... â™ª
â™ª <i>Here's to us, here's to love</i> â™ª

31:19.579 --> 31:21.555
â™ª <i>All the times that
we messed up â™ª</i>

31:21.556 --> 31:23.098
â™ª Here's to you â™ª

31:23.099 --> 31:25.550
â™ª Fill the glass â™ª

31:25.551 --> 31:28.753
â™ª 'Cause the last few days
have gone too fast â™ª

31:28.754 --> 31:31.481
â™ª If they give you hell â™ª

31:31.482 --> 31:33.900
â™ª You tell 'em
forget themselves â™ª

31:33.901 --> 31:36.027
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

31:36.028 --> 31:37.195
â™ª <i>Here's to us</i> â™ª

31:37.196 --> 31:38.613
â™ª Oh, here's to us â™ª

31:38.614 --> 31:40.115
â™ª <i>Here's to us</i> â™ª

31:40.116 --> 31:41.816
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

31:41.817 --> 31:43.368
â™ª Here's to love â™ª

31:43.369 --> 31:46.288
â™ª Wish everybody well â™ª

31:46.289 --> 31:47.622
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

31:47.623 --> 31:49.875
â™ª Here's to love â™ª

31:49.876 --> 31:51.543
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

31:51.544 --> 31:53.920
â™ª Here's to us. â™ª

32:23.741 --> 32:28.872
I've crossed oceans of time
to bring the results of this

32:28.873 --> 32:32.417
show choir competition.

32:34.712 --> 32:37.923
In third place,

32:37.924 --> 32:40.008
from Our Lady
of Perpetual Sorrow,

32:40.009 --> 32:43.720
the Golden Goblets!

32:45.262 --> 32:50.435
And now... the moment
you've all been waiting for.

32:57.525 --> 32:59.778
The 2012 Midwest

32:59.779 --> 33:00.945
Regional Champion

33:00.946 --> 33:02.739
from McKinley High...

33:04.281 --> 33:06.072
...the New Directions!

33:26.059 --> 33:28.431
Coach Sylvester?

33:28.432 --> 33:30.513
Quinn, thank you for coming.

33:30.514 --> 33:33.645
I know you must be exhausted
from singing all those "oohs"

33:33.646 --> 33:34.984
and background "ahs."

33:34.985 --> 33:36.318
Have a seat.

33:37.525 --> 33:39.955
I've been doing a lot
of thinking this week,

33:39.956 --> 33:43.029
and, um, I don't know if
it's this Karofsky thing

33:43.030 --> 33:45.077
or even seeing you perform,

33:45.078 --> 33:47.117
but I realized something.

33:47.118 --> 33:49.703
I always admired you, Quinn.

33:51.518 --> 33:52.835
At first, I thought
it was because

33:52.836 --> 33:54.207
you reminded me
of a younger,

33:54.208 --> 33:56.672
somewhat less striking
Sue Sylvester,

33:56.673 --> 33:59.508
but then I realized
that I admire you

33:59.509 --> 34:02.757
for all the ways
you're not like me.

34:02.758 --> 34:06.094
You proved that it's never too
late to turn your life around.

34:06.095 --> 34:07.767
And with that in mind,

34:07.768 --> 34:09.347
I'm giving you this.

34:16.603 --> 34:18.811
You're not gonna regret this.

34:18.812 --> 34:21.525
I'm gonna win us a national
championship in this uniform.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.364
Hey, Fabray, looking good.

34:23.366 --> 34:25.362
Thanks, boys.
Catch you later.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.864
Hey.

34:26.866 --> 34:28.404
How do I look?

34:28.405 --> 34:29.705
Coach Sylvester gave it
to me earlier,

34:29.706 --> 34:30.827
and I couldn't resist.

34:30.828 --> 34:33.074
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

34:33.076 --> 34:34.664
Everyone deserves to be happy.

34:34.665 --> 34:36.862
When you were singing that song,

34:36.862 --> 34:39.418
you were singing it to Finn
and only Finn.

34:39.420 --> 34:41.382
Right?

34:41.384 --> 34:43.797
He really does
make you so happy.

34:43.799 --> 34:46.092
I want to support you,
Rachel, and Finn,

34:46.092 --> 34:48.540
and come to the wedding,

34:48.541 --> 34:49.888
if it's not too late.

35:09.240 --> 35:12.827
Can I come in?

35:14.536 --> 35:15.538
The doctors took me off

35:15.539 --> 35:17.624
72-hour watch.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.459
I get to go home tomorrow.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.085
That's great.

35:22.670 --> 35:25.757
I'm really happy
that you're alive, David.

35:26.913 --> 35:28.426
Me, too.

35:37.935 --> 35:40.730
I should have returned
your calls.

35:40.731 --> 35:43.066
Why would you, after the way
I've treated you?

35:43.067 --> 35:44.901
It's okay.
No, it's not

35:44.902 --> 35:47.032
okay.

35:47.033 --> 35:49.151
It's like you said
on Valentine's Day,

35:49.152 --> 35:53.739
I made your life a
living hell for months.

35:53.740 --> 35:57.743
But when the same
thing happened to me,

35:57.744 --> 35:59.624
I couldn't even take
it for a week.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.132
I suppose a best friend
telling me

36:03.133 --> 36:05.130
he never wants
to talk to me again,

36:05.131 --> 36:06.422
my mom

36:06.720 --> 36:08.787
telling me
that I have a disease...

36:10.790 --> 36:12.641
...and maybe I can be cured...

36:16.813 --> 36:18.685
I don't know what to do.

36:21.687 --> 36:24.190
I can't go back to that school.

36:24.191 --> 36:26.484
Then go to another school.

36:26.485 --> 36:27.986
I'm not gonna
lie to you, it...

36:27.987 --> 36:31.277
it isn't gonna be easy.

36:31.278 --> 36:34.697
And there'll be
some days when...

36:34.698 --> 36:37.833
life just sucks.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.623
But you're gonna get
through this.

36:40.624 --> 36:43.001
'Cause I'm gonna help you.

36:43.002 --> 36:45.753
And so is everyone else
who loves you

36:45.754 --> 36:47.839
and accepts you for who you are.

36:49.546 --> 36:52.047
And if they can't
accept that, then...

36:52.048 --> 36:53.928
screw 'em.

36:53.929 --> 36:56.168
Right?

36:56.169 --> 36:58.003
Yeah.

37:00.059 --> 37:02.474
This week, um,

37:02.475 --> 37:05.510
Mr. Shue had us think
about something

37:05.511 --> 37:07.317
we're looking forward to
in the future.

37:07.318 --> 37:08.568
You want to give it a go?

37:08.569 --> 37:10.028
I don't know.

37:10.029 --> 37:11.617
Come on.

37:11.618 --> 37:12.906
I'll help you.

37:12.907 --> 37:15.120
Close your eyes,

37:15.121 --> 37:19.370
and imagine what life
could be like

37:19.371 --> 37:21.377
in ten years.

37:22.862 --> 37:24.375
You're sitting

37:24.376 --> 37:27.216
<i>in a fantastic office.</i>

37:27.217 --> 37:29.214
<i>You're some kind
of successful professional.</i>

37:29.215 --> 37:31.299
A lawyer, maybe.

37:31.300 --> 37:32.592
Could I be a sports agent?

37:32.593 --> 37:35.345
Sure.

37:35.346 --> 37:37.593
You're a big sports agent

37:37.594 --> 37:39.599
living in the city
of your dreams

37:39.600 --> 37:42.852
because you left Lima
and never looked back.

37:43.216 --> 37:45.021
<i>Your handsome partner comes
to visit you in your office</i>

37:45.022 --> 37:47.398
<i>and brings along your son.</i>

37:47.399 --> 37:49.150
<i>You're taking the rest
of the day off work</i>

37:49.151 --> 37:52.191
<i>because you're taking your son
to his first football game.</i>

37:53.862 --> 37:57.075
You lean over to your partner,
and you say,

37:57.076 --> 37:59.619
"I'm so happy right now."

38:06.041 --> 38:07.956
You, uh...

38:07.957 --> 38:10.129
you said last week you wanted
to be friends?

38:11.380 --> 38:13.591
I'd like that.

38:13.592 --> 38:16.094
Me, too.

38:24.478 --> 38:26.729
I believe congratulations
are in order.

38:26.730 --> 38:28.975
What do you mean?

38:28.976 --> 38:30.643
You've never congratulated me
about anything.

38:30.644 --> 38:31.651
Oh, I was

38:31.652 --> 38:33.563
in the audience
at Regionals today,

38:33.564 --> 38:36.114
and I thought the Glee Club

38:36.115 --> 38:38.157
was just fantastic.

38:38.158 --> 38:40.159
Now you congratulate me.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.787
Why?
I'm pregnant.

38:44.474 --> 38:46.457
Sue, that's incredible.

38:46.458 --> 38:49.168
Wow.
Thank you.

38:49.169 --> 38:51.129
Wait, what are you doing here?

38:51.130 --> 38:53.506
Oh, I wouldn't miss Finn
and Rachel getting married.

38:53.507 --> 38:55.133
I'm crashing.

38:57.176 --> 38:58.671
I think you can win
at Nationals,

38:58.672 --> 38:59.971
and I want to help you.

38:59.972 --> 39:01.431
Are you serious?

39:01.432 --> 39:02.658
I'm a proven champion.

39:02.659 --> 39:03.891
I got some tricks up my sleeve.

39:03.892 --> 39:05.226
What's the catch?

39:05.227 --> 39:08.438
You know, I don't think
there is a catch.

39:09.646 --> 39:12.101
I think I really
just want to help you.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.193
- Isn't that weird?
- Mm-hmm.

39:14.194 --> 39:16.154
Damn hormones.

39:20.325 --> 39:22.111
Okay, could we just have
a show of hands

39:22.112 --> 39:23.679
that we all still think
this is a crazy idea?

39:24.661 --> 39:25.865
Okay, good, that settles it.

39:25.866 --> 39:26.873
I'm pulling the plug.

39:26.874 --> 39:29.083
Burt, calm down.
Calm down? Carol, our kids

39:29.084 --> 39:31.169
are getting hitched...
we screwed up big-time.

39:31.170 --> 39:32.378
We started playing
these crazy

39:32.379 --> 39:34.657
reverse psychology games
with them,

39:34.658 --> 39:35.858
look where we are.
The blame game?

39:35.859 --> 39:38.211
- This'll be fun. Bring it, Burt.
- How did we screw up?

39:38.212 --> 39:40.178
By raising two kind,

39:40.179 --> 39:42.548
wonderful,
independently-minded children?

39:42.549 --> 39:43.716
I agree with Burt.

39:43.717 --> 39:46.202
They're in love, wunderbar,
but nowhere near ready

39:46.203 --> 39:47.685
for this kind of commitment.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.187
At least we're here.

39:49.188 --> 39:50.980
The truth is, if we'd
come down hard on them,

39:50.981 --> 39:53.042
they would have gone
behind our back and eloped.

39:53.043 --> 39:54.275
Trust me, I know my son.

39:54.276 --> 39:57.180
Okay? And once he puts
his mind to something,

39:57.181 --> 39:58.731
there is no getting him
off of it.

39:58.732 --> 40:01.934
Same with Rachel. At this point,
even Patti LuPone herself

40:01.935 --> 40:03.701
couldn't talk her
out of marrying Finn.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.620
- Barbara could.
- Maybe Barbara.

40:05.621 --> 40:06.788
- Who's Barbara?
- Streisand.

40:06.789 --> 40:09.075
But, since Babs
is probably shopping

40:09.076 --> 40:10.443
in her private
underground mall right now...

40:10.444 --> 40:11.828
you know she has her own mall?

40:11.829 --> 40:13.146
Here's what we're gonna do:

40:13.147 --> 40:14.504
When the Justice of the Peace

40:14.505 --> 40:17.399
- says does anybody here object...
- Hell, yeah, I do.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.717
We will all say, "We do."

40:19.718 --> 40:21.386
â™ª With feeling. â™ª

40:21.387 --> 40:25.264
Burt, you will run
interference with Finn.

40:25.265 --> 40:28.726
Carol, you will distract
the Justice of the Peace

40:28.727 --> 40:30.520
with your feminine wiles.

40:30.521 --> 40:33.582
I will hustle Rachel
out the side door

40:33.583 --> 40:36.359
and into our waiting car,
where you, LeRoy, will drive...

40:36.360 --> 40:38.903
I don't drive...
straight to Broadway.

40:38.904 --> 40:41.090
And if that doesn't
start to get our baby girl

40:41.091 --> 40:42.198
back on her career track,

40:42.199 --> 40:44.200
I don't know what will.
Are we agreed?

40:44.201 --> 40:45.743
Sounds like a plan.

41:02.175 --> 41:03.795
Wow, Rachel, you...

41:03.796 --> 41:04.971
You just...

41:04.972 --> 41:07.098
You look...
You do, too.

41:07.389 --> 41:08.750
Ready to go in there?

41:08.751 --> 41:10.602
Just-just-just hold on
just a second.

41:10.603 --> 41:11.686
I-I just want to...

41:11.687 --> 41:15.590
take a second just to...
remember this. Us.

41:17.234 --> 41:19.068
Oh, it's Quinn.
Sorry.

41:19.069 --> 41:21.112
"Ran home to get
my bridesmaids dress.

41:21.403 --> 41:22.781
Be there soon."

41:22.782 --> 41:23.990
Great.

41:23.991 --> 41:26.576
Well, Miss Hudson-Berry,

41:26.577 --> 41:28.786
everybody's waiting.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.789
â™ª Goin' to the chapel
and we're â™ª

41:30.790 --> 41:36.277
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª

41:36.278 --> 41:38.379
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª

41:38.380 --> 41:39.964
â™ª And we're â™ª

41:39.965 --> 41:43.843
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª

41:43.844 --> 41:46.804
â™ª Gee, I really love you â™ª

41:46.805 --> 41:50.057
â™ª And we're gonna get married â™ª

41:51.727 --> 41:54.020
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª

41:54.021 --> 41:55.680
â™ª Of love... â™ª

41:55.681 --> 41:57.816
Face it, Quinn's not coming.

41:57.817 --> 41:59.017
She said she'd be here, okay?

41:59.018 --> 42:00.301
I don't want to start
without her.

42:00.567 --> 42:02.070
Is everything okay?

42:02.071 --> 42:03.471
Yeah, we've got
five minutes.

42:03.472 --> 42:05.364
Come on, let's go.
Whew!

42:05.365 --> 42:07.575
â™ª Sky is blue, whoa-oh-oh â™ª

42:07.576 --> 42:09.778
â™ª Birds all sing â™ª

42:09.779 --> 42:13.748
â™ª As if they knew â™ª

42:13.749 --> 42:16.451
â™ª Today's our day â™ª

42:16.452 --> 42:18.502
Looking sharp.
Thanks.

42:18.503 --> 42:21.840
- â™ª We'll say I do â™ª
- All right, come on.

42:21.841 --> 42:23.507
â™ª And we'll never
be lonely... â™ª

42:23.508 --> 42:25.051
Finn, out.

42:25.052 --> 42:26.711
You can't see the bride
before the wedding.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.137
I've already seen her.

42:28.138 --> 42:29.680
But that's bad luck.
No, it's fine.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.599
Rachel, we got to go right now,
or we're gonna lose our slot.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.434
Could we please just wait
a couple more minutes

42:33.435 --> 42:35.019
- for Quinn, please?
- It's now or never.

42:35.020 --> 42:36.854
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª

42:36.855 --> 42:39.858
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª

42:39.859 --> 42:44.111
â™ª And we're gonna get married â™ª

42:44.112 --> 42:45.655
â™ª Gee, I really love you â™ª

42:45.656 --> 42:47.849
If we're gonna do
something, do it now.

42:47.850 --> 42:50.952
I'm gonna fake
an epileptic seizure.

42:50.953 --> 42:53.040
You're not an epileptic.

42:53.041 --> 42:55.039
- That's why I'm gonna fake it.
- Hurry up.
