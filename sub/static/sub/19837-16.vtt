<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.150 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

02:08.120 --> 02:09.630
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

02:09.630 --> 02:11.720
<b>I carelessly let him escape.</b>

02:11.720 --> 02:13.570
<b>Liar.</b>

02:13.570 --> 02:18.440
<b>He probably begged you to grant him</b>

02:18.440 --> 02:19.950
<b>one final wish, yes?</b>

02:19.950 --> 02:23.080
<b>Well, I felt sorry for the guy.</b>

02:23.080 --> 02:26.020
<b>Given that he was dead either way.</b>

02:26.020 --> 02:29.260
<b>You should cease pitying enemies 
who serve no purpose.</b>

02:30.580 --> 02:32.630
<b>I have standards.</b>

02:33.220 --> 02:35.710
<b>I'm not interested in people 
who have no purpose.</b>

02:36.150 --> 02:40.090
<b>I only spare those whose deaths

<b>Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.</b>

02:52.970 --> 02:58.320
<b>In the silence of the night, 
something is surely about to happen...</b>

03:29.870 --> 03:30.600
<b><i>Now!</i></b>

03:38.230 --> 03:41.220
<b>Oh, it's them...</b>

03:41.830 --> 03:43.490
<b>Amusing.</b>

04:00.410 --> 04:03.050
<b><i>Hisoka has found his prey.</i></b>

04:09.270 --> 04:11.390
<b><i>Leorio! Kurapika!</i></b>

04:14.440 --> 04:18.240
<b><i>I didn't expect him to go

04:18.850 --> 04:20.150
<b><i>What should I do?</i></b>

04:21.240 --> 04:22.120
<b><i>Don't stop!</i></b>

04:22.120 --> 04:23.140
<b><i>Stick to the plan,</i></b>

04:23.140 --> 04:25.030
<b><i>and when Hisoka attacks his prey,</i></b>

04:25.030 --> 04:26.240
<b><i>go for the ID tag!</i></b>

04:26.730 --> 04:30.740
<b><i>That's my only chance to take Hisoka's tag!</i></b>

04:41.050 --> 04:42.550
<b><i>No, I can't just ignore them.</i></b>

04:43.540 --> 04:46.800
<b><i>If they start fighting, I'll change plans.</i></b>

04:51.330 --> 04:55.310
<b>So I've figured out who my target is,</b>

04:55.900 --> 04:59.800
<b>but how am I supposed to find her 
on this huge island?</b>

04:59.800 --> 05:03.650
<b>Isn't walking around aimlessly 
a waste of energy?</b>

05:03.650 --> 05:07.570
<b>Constantly whining would be 
an even bigger waste of energy.</b>

05:07.570 --> 05:11.230
<b>You already have six points, 
so you're finished.</b>

05:11.230 --> 05:14.700
<b>But if I don't find my target...</b>

05:19.080 --> 05:20.340
<b>Hey.</b>

05:20.340 --> 05:21.130
<b><i>Hisoka!</i></b>

05:21.810 --> 05:25.370
<b>Imagine meeting you here...</b>

05:26.680 --> 05:29.300
<b>I keep running into people 
I don't want to encounter.</b>

05:29.650 --> 05:30.790
<b>You see,</b>

05:30.790 --> 05:33.390
<b>I need two more points.</b>

05:34.090 --> 05:36.080
<b>Could you give me your tags?</b>

05:36.590 --> 05:37.770
<b>What was that?!</b>

05:37.770 --> 05:39.280
<b>Screw that! I'm not gonna...</b>

05:39.280 --> 05:40.070
<b>Leorio!</b>

05:41.150 --> 05:43.500
<b>You said that you need 
two additional points.</b>

05:43.990 --> 05:47.520
<b>Which implies that we 
are not your targets,</b>

05:47.520 --> 05:48.910
<b>correct?</b>

05:48.910 --> 05:51.700
<b>I'm the one who's asking 
the questions here.</b>

05:51.700 --> 05:54.910
<b>Will you give me your tags or not?</b>

05:56.260 --> 05:57.670
<b>That depends.</b>

06:00.040 --> 06:03.570
<b>We currently have four tags.</b>

06:03.570 --> 06:07.910
<b>Mine, my target's, Leorio's,</b>

06:07.910 --> 06:10.930
<b>and a tag worth only a single point to us.</b>

06:11.380 --> 06:12.410
<b>Of these,</b>

06:12.410 --> 06:16.680
<b>only two could be the number of your target.</b>

06:17.230 --> 06:20.940
<b>Mine, or the tag only worth a single point.</b>

06:21.610 --> 06:24.420
<b>Leorio's number is #403.</b>

06:24.420 --> 06:27.820
<b>He was the target of #16, Tonpa.</b>

06:27.820 --> 06:32.320
<b>And my target was #16.</b>

06:33.090 --> 06:35.560
<b>Each person was assigned 
a different target,</b>

06:35.560 --> 06:37.580
<b>so #16 and #403 are out.</b>

06:37.580 --> 06:38.830
<b>Indeed...</b>

06:41.060 --> 06:44.590
<b>Neither of those is my target.</b>

06:44.590 --> 06:45.840
<b>So?</b>

06:46.290 --> 06:48.840
<b>That leaves the other two tags.</b>

06:49.180 --> 06:52.580
<b>If you're willing to take the tag worth 
only one point to us and leave,</b>

06:52.580 --> 06:54.650
<b>you can have it.</b>

06:54.650 --> 06:55.350
<b>Huh?</b>

06:55.350 --> 06:58.350
<b>But I will not let you have mine.</b>

06:59.430 --> 07:02.270
<b>And the same goes for the other two.</b>

07:04.700 --> 07:07.060
<b>If you insist on taking them by force,</b>

07:08.610 --> 07:11.110
<b>you'll have to fight me!</b>

07:55.000 --> 07:58.040
<b>Out of curiosity, what is your number?</b>

07:59.560 --> 08:01.540
<b>#404.</b>

08:07.540 --> 08:08.780
<b>Very well.</b>

08:10.660 --> 08:12.480
<b>You have a deal.</b>

08:12.480 --> 08:15.050
<b>I'll only take the one tag.</b>

08:23.380 --> 08:24.500
<b>I'll leave it here.</b>

08:25.310 --> 08:26.890
<b>Don't worry.</b>

08:27.660 --> 08:30.320
<b>I'll be standing here for a while.</b>

08:47.150 --> 08:48.850
<b>In only a few days,</b>

08:48.850 --> 08:51.570
<b>they've grown so much, 
I barely recognize them.</b>

08:51.570 --> 08:53.840
<b>But they have much more to learn...</b>

08:54.510 --> 08:56.940
<b>Why must unripe fruit</b>

08:56.940 --> 09:00.260
<b>be so tantalizing?</b>

09:01.980 --> 09:03.020
<b>A pity.</b>

09:03.020 --> 09:05.100
<b>This is the wrong tag...</b>

09:12.240 --> 09:13.540
<b><i>Whew...</i></b>

09:14.030 --> 09:17.610
<b><i>But now I only have one more chance.</i></b>

09:18.230 --> 09:21.520
<b><i>When Hisoka locates his next prey.</i></b>

09:32.440 --> 09:33.710
<b><i>Wait!</i></b>

09:33.710 --> 09:36.630
<b><i>What if the next person Hisoka finds</i></b>

09:36.630 --> 09:40.640
<b><i>doesn't fight him either?</i></b>

09:47.210 --> 09:48.550
<b><i>That's right!</i></b>

09:48.550 --> 09:52.090
<b><i>If that person also hands over a tag,</i></b>

09:52.090 --> 09:55.780
<b><i>I won't get another chance!</i></b>

10:06.160 --> 10:07.640
<b><i>I'm so stupid!</i></b>

10:07.640 --> 10:11.170
<b><i>I never even considered that!</i></b>

10:34.420 --> 10:35.740
<b><i>I'm scared...</i></b>

10:35.740 --> 10:36.700
<b><i>No more.</i></b>

10:36.700 --> 10:38.700
<b><i>I don't want to be here!</i></b>

10:42.080 --> 10:44.450
<b><i>I can sense his blood lust from here...</i></b>

10:46.310 --> 10:47.880
<b>Uh-oh.</b>

10:50.200 --> 10:56.000
<b>Those boys got me all tingly...</b>

10:57.110 --> 10:59.370
<b>I must calm it.</b>

11:51.160 --> 11:52.020
<b>Okay.</b>

11:52.840 --> 11:54.030
<b>Time to go.</b>

11:57.270 --> 11:58.180
<b><i>I can do this!</i></b>

12:00.570 --> 12:02.280
<b><i>His blood lust has calmed,</i></b>

12:02.280 --> 12:05.780
<b><i>but the look in his eyes 
doesn't even compare to before.</i></b>

12:06.350 --> 12:08.380
<b><i>I'm certain he'll attack</i></b>

12:08.380 --> 12:12.290
<b><i>the next person he sees, 
even if that person surrenders.</i></b>

12:12.290 --> 12:13.410
<b><i>I know!</i></b>

12:13.410 --> 12:16.810
<b><i>I should move ahead and 
locate his next prey!</i></b>

12:19.760 --> 12:24.210
<b><i>I also need to find a good spot 
from which to steal his tag...</i></b>

12:40.830 --> 12:41.760
<b><i>There!</i></b>

12:44.760 --> 12:48.830
<b><i>At this rate, Hisoka will spot him 
in the next minute.</i></b>

12:49.260 --> 12:52.200
<b><i>I have to figure out where 
their paths will cross...</i></b>

12:54.910 --> 12:55.950
<b><i>Over there!</i></b>

12:59.280 --> 13:00.590
<b><i>I've gotta hurry.</i></b>

13:03.410 --> 13:04.590
<b><i>Hisoka will attack,</i></b>

13:04.590 --> 13:07.340
<b><i>as soon as he notices that guy.</i></b>

13:08.050 --> 13:10.880
<b><i>This is my chance to steal his tag...</i></b>

13:11.420 --> 13:12.770
<b><i>My last chance!</i></b>

13:27.070 --> 13:37.170
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

13:33.120 --> 13:37.170
<b>Chance</b>

14:05.790 --> 14:09.390
<b><i>Hisoka has completely 
hidden his presence.</i></b>

14:16.290 --> 14:18.850
<b><i>Oh, no! He's going to notice me!</i></b>

14:26.020 --> 14:28.780
<b><i>I have to conceal my presence, too.</i></b>

14:53.290 --> 14:57.250
<b><i>Completely conceal my...</i></b>

14:59.500 --> 15:00.890
<b><i>presence.</i></b>

15:14.080 --> 15:15.140
<b><i>Here he comes!</i></b>

15:19.040 --> 15:20.140
<b>Hisoka!</b>

15:20.140 --> 15:22.400
<b>Damn... Bring it!</b>

15:22.820 --> 15:24.400
<b><i>He's going to fight back.</i></b>

16:34.420 --> 16:35.460
<b><i>I did it...</i></b>

16:35.460 --> 16:38.390
<b><i>I took Hisoka's tag!</i></b>

17:03.370 --> 17:05.420
<b>Approximately, seven thousand.</b>

17:06.180 --> 17:09.920
<b>Do you know what that 
number represents?</b>

17:11.370 --> 17:15.430
<b>The number of chances 
I had to kill you.</b>

17:19.250 --> 17:21.800
<b>It's also the number of times you swung</b>

17:21.800 --> 17:24.440
<b>your fishing rod when you were training.</b>

17:29.940 --> 17:33.580
<b>You were completely open 
when you were swinging your rod.</b>

17:33.580 --> 17:37.280
<b>But I admit that I admired your 
concentration and accuracy.</b>

17:38.070 --> 17:41.550
<b>That swing just now was 
especially impressive.</b>

17:41.550 --> 17:45.260
<b>But you didn't pay attention to 
your own surroundings.</b>

17:45.940 --> 17:49.080
<b>Next time, remember to 
watch your own back.</b>

17:49.840 --> 17:51.110
<b>So long.</b>

17:59.130 --> 18:00.500
<b>Damn it...</b>

18:51.200 --> 18:52.650
<b>You surprise me.</b>

18:54.330 --> 18:58.280
<b>You hid your presence, 
while waiting for your chance?</b>

18:58.280 --> 19:02.660
<b>Waiting for me to attack another?</b>

19:04.030 --> 19:06.840
<b>Did you teach yourself how 
to conceal your presence?</b>

19:06.840 --> 19:08.460
<b>Marvelous...</b>

19:08.460 --> 19:10.920
<b>Like a wild animal.</b>

19:11.290 --> 19:13.550
<b>And your timing was impeccable.</b>

19:14.080 --> 19:16.930
<b>You concealed all traces of your attack</b>

19:16.930 --> 19:20.930
<b>by timing it with my own attack.</b>

19:21.530 --> 19:23.080
<b>A splendid job.</b>

19:24.940 --> 19:28.540
<b>His poison darts completely 
relax your muscles.</b>

19:29.070 --> 19:32.690
<b>The effects last ten days 
in a normal person.</b>

19:32.690 --> 19:34.900
<b>Only three days are left.</b>

19:34.900 --> 19:37.940
<b>I'm sure you will have 
recovered by then.</b>

19:39.750 --> 19:41.020
<b>Wait...</b>

19:43.810 --> 19:49.710
<b>Didn't you come to take back your tag?</b>

19:49.710 --> 19:52.770
<b>No, I just came to commend you.</b>

19:52.770 --> 19:55.460
<b>Turns out that he was my target.</b>

19:57.210 --> 20:00.250
<b>So I don't need that anymore.</b>

20:00.250 --> 20:02.610
<b>I don't need it, either.</b>

20:02.610 --> 20:04.470
<b>Don't say that...</b>

20:04.900 --> 20:06.510
<b>You owe me one now.</b>

20:06.510 --> 20:09.120
<b>Feel free to pay me back when you want.</b>

20:09.120 --> 20:10.430
<b>Goodbye.</b>

20:19.240 --> 20:21.810
<b>I don't want to owe anyone...</b>

20:22.470 --> 20:24.740
<b>You can have it back now.</b>

20:28.910 --> 20:29.870
<b>I refuse.</b>

20:31.040 --> 20:33.870
<b>Right now, I'm letting you live.</b>

20:33.870 --> 20:38.380
<b>And I'll continue to keep you alive,</b>

20:38.380 --> 20:42.380
<b>until you've grown enough 
to be worth killing...</b>

20:50.800 --> 20:52.320
<b>I'll only take it back</b>

20:52.320 --> 20:56.150
<b>when you're able to punch me 
in the face, just like that.</b>

20:57.030 --> 21:01.270
<b>Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.</b>

21:45.830 --> 21:50.720
<b>Gon was completely helpless 
against Hisoka,</b>

21:50.720 --> 21:53.150
<b>who knocked him out 
with a single blow.</b>

21:53.780 --> 21:57.730
<b>What must he be thinking, 
alone in the darkness?</b>

23:25.420 --> 23:27.010
<b>Next time: Trap x In The x Hole!</b>

23:27.460 --> 23:28.920
<b>The end... the end...</b>

23:28.920 --> 23:31.050
<b>I wanna be your friend!</b>

23:31.050 --> 23:32.010
<b>F-Friend?</b>

23:32.010 --> 23:34.390
<b>Y-You're so embarrassing...</b>
