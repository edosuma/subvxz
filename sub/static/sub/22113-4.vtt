00:00.334 --> 00:01.967
In the book of our lives,

00:02.003 --> 00:06.007
we've come to a new
chapter: Zihuatanejo.

00:06.257 --> 00:10.112
To mark the occasion, I
have a special surprise.

00:10.137 --> 00:11.403
Ta-da!

00:11.428 --> 00:12.727
Oh! Ta-da!

00:15.015 --> 00:18.048
Had a little trouble spelling
it, but welcome to Zihuatanejo.

00:18.073 --> 00:20.829
Anyway, I know how much
you all love my singing.

00:21.556 --> 00:25.624
So by assumed popular
request, I wrote a song.

01:31.583 --> 01:34.251
I declare this medical clinic

01:34.286 --> 01:36.319
open!

01:39.192 --> 01:41.285
Let me give you the gran tourino.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.602
Okay. Um, oh.

01:42.627 --> 01:46.714
So, I took some hospital scrubs
and I made some new curtains.

01:46.749 --> 01:49.625
I bleached most of the
blood out, but then I decided

01:49.650 --> 01:52.140
to leave a little in for a pop of color.

01:52.765 --> 01:55.056
Then I found some old X-rays

01:55.091 --> 01:59.193
and I invited them to
a Pilbasian paint party.

01:59.228 --> 02:01.362
And that party went all night.

02:02.432 --> 02:05.125
Oh, and see that autopsy table?

02:05.150 --> 02:07.835
That was sitting in the
morgue, gathering dust,

02:07.870 --> 02:11.605
so I just scraped the corpse
off, did a little spit polish,

02:11.641 --> 02:15.609
and voilà, a lovely dining table.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.612
So, when do you want to move in?

02:18.648 --> 02:22.717
'Cause now works for me and
I would also accept yesterday.

02:24.455 --> 02:26.032
Joking.

02:26.587 --> 02:27.722
I'm excited.

02:29.158 --> 02:33.761
Um, okay, well, look, hon, um,

02:33.796 --> 02:36.052
we totally appreciate that offer,

02:36.077 --> 02:38.011
but Erica and I,

02:38.082 --> 02:40.950
we're kind of happy at
our little beach house.

02:40.975 --> 02:42.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and Todd and I,

02:42.105 --> 02:43.437
we found this cute little

02:43.473 --> 02:47.273
- B and B up the road that we really like.
- So nice.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.197
- I see.
- Oh, now, hon,

02:50.222 --> 02:54.381
this is not a big deal 'cause
we're not gonna be that far away

02:54.417 --> 02:57.852
and everything is gonna be
just pretty much the same.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.443
Trust me.

03:00.135 --> 03:01.759
Yeah, sure.

03:01.784 --> 03:04.191
Okay. Now that that's been settled,

03:04.227 --> 03:06.694
Todd, we have a honeymoon to get to.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.130
Hubba hubba. Come here.

03:09.165 --> 03:10.731
I'm so excited.

03:10.767 --> 03:13.434
Melissa and I have some
pretty wild stuff planned.

03:13.469 --> 03:16.203
I mean, we even established a safe word.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.705
Well, have fun, bud.

03:17.740 --> 03:18.939
I'll be thinking about you.

03:18.975 --> 03:20.941
I'll-I'll be thinking about you, too.

03:20.977 --> 03:23.210
Not during the sexual parts, you know.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.779
What, am I not attractive to you, bud?

03:24.814 --> 03:26.113
Tandy, come on, bud.

03:26.149 --> 03:27.948
- You go have some fun, bud.
- Will do.

03:27.984 --> 03:29.483
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey.

03:29.519 --> 03:32.486
Yeah, we got to go, too, so,
see y'all when we see y'all.

03:32.522 --> 03:35.289
- Bye.
- Well...

03:36.778 --> 03:38.993
guess it was nice while it lasted.

03:39.028 --> 03:42.763
Care Bear, don't you think
you're being a little dramatic?

03:42.799 --> 03:45.166
Mark my words.

03:45.201 --> 03:48.978
Living apart will destroy this group.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.678
All right, Jasper, flip the switch!

03:59.849 --> 04:03.617
Dude, is that magnet micro-surfin'?

04:03.653 --> 04:05.922
'Cause it just caught a microwave.

04:05.947 --> 04:07.813
Cowabunga!

04:12.295 --> 04:15.229
Okay, Jasper, if my
calculations are correct,

04:15.264 --> 04:17.164
when you flip that switch,

04:17.200 --> 04:20.233
this is gonna play a
tune we all know and love.

04:20.269 --> 04:22.203
"Jingle Bells."

04:22.238 --> 04:23.871
Flip the switch, bud.

04:27.292 --> 04:29.443
Merry Christmas!

04:33.049 --> 04:35.382
You know, Jasper, when a piece of metal

04:35.418 --> 04:38.118
and a magnet develop
feelings for each other,

04:38.372 --> 04:41.125
they get what's called attraction.

04:47.945 --> 04:50.564
Okay, flip the switch.

04:52.810 --> 04:54.715
Science, huh?

04:56.339 --> 04:59.540
Okay, be ready. Here I come.

05:05.848 --> 05:09.149
Okay, flip the switch, Jasper.

05:09.507 --> 05:12.219
Jasper! Jasper, turn it off!

05:12.255 --> 05:13.854
Turn it off!

05:13.890 --> 05:15.389
Oh, God!

05:15.424 --> 05:18.626
Oh, landed right on the hammer, too.

05:18.661 --> 05:20.794
Oh, why the hell did I
leave that thing in there?

05:20.830 --> 05:23.427
Oh, so happy to be back on the ground.

05:24.731 --> 05:25.941
Jasper!

05:25.966 --> 05:28.235
Release! Release!

05:29.333 --> 05:31.472
Jasper!

05:31.861 --> 05:34.508
Where'd you go, bud?!

05:35.809 --> 05:37.209
Uh, come in.

05:39.743 --> 05:41.340
Housekeeping.

05:41.365 --> 05:42.797
Well, hello, ma'am.

05:42.822 --> 05:43.684
You're from Russia.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.532
I can tell by your accent.

05:45.775 --> 05:46.720
Da.

05:46.756 --> 05:48.522
Well, I'm a wealthy businessman

05:48.557 --> 05:50.324
from Glacier Bay, Alaska,

05:50.359 --> 05:53.175
in town for a sombrero conference.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.362
Can I offer you turn-down service?

05:55.398 --> 05:58.620
Well, as you can see, my
bed's already been turned down.

05:58.871 --> 06:01.672
If I can't offer you turn-down service,

06:01.948 --> 06:05.439
perhaps I can offer
you turn-on service.

06:05.474 --> 06:07.908
Well, whatever on earth is that?

06:07.944 --> 06:09.910
Take off your pant. I show you.

06:09.946 --> 06:12.279
Now, why would I do that?

06:12.977 --> 06:14.815
Because it involves a part of your body

06:14.850 --> 06:17.284
currently covered in pant.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.553
Well, this is all very confusing.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.889
But okay.

06:25.865 --> 06:27.294
Oh, Gail!

06:28.232 --> 06:31.098
Gail! Gail!

06:35.487 --> 06:37.271
Little help?!

06:39.518 --> 06:41.475
Yeah, sure.

06:41.871 --> 06:42.970
Ah.

06:42.995 --> 06:44.545
Yeah, friggin' Jasper ditched me!

06:44.580 --> 06:46.046
Little turkey.

06:46.082 --> 06:49.203
So, there's a switch up on the
control panel right up there...

06:49.228 --> 06:52.953
Yeah, yeah, I've operated
one of these suckers before.

06:53.299 --> 06:54.555
Oh, no, no! No, no!

06:54.590 --> 06:56.256
I think you're doing the wrong button!

06:56.292 --> 06:58.792
- Nope. This is the one I was looking for.
- No... Ah!

07:03.729 --> 07:05.399
Thank you!

07:08.910 --> 07:11.283
Tandy, where have you been?

07:11.308 --> 07:14.608
Well, uh, I was teaching
Jasper some junkyard science.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.752
Then, uh, Gail came by

07:16.777 --> 07:18.612
and taught me about medieval gravity.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.980
You saw Gail?

07:20.016 --> 07:21.582
How was she?

07:21.617 --> 07:22.883
What was she doing?

07:22.918 --> 07:24.284
Ooh, tell me everything.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.520
I don't know, you know,
I think she was shopping.

07:26.555 --> 07:28.389
Oh, that is so Gail.

07:28.424 --> 07:31.392
She loves obtaining items she needs.

07:31.427 --> 07:32.893
Wha... how'd she look?

07:33.452 --> 07:36.163
Fine, I guess. You know, still
looked to have all her teeth.

07:36.198 --> 07:37.631
What was she wearing?

07:37.666 --> 07:40.094
Well, I don't know, uh, top, bottom.

07:40.119 --> 07:41.952
- Yeah.
- You know. Shoes, maybe.

07:41.977 --> 07:43.877
Um, little scarf thing.

07:46.363 --> 07:48.110
Oh.

07:51.714 --> 07:54.481
Life really does go on, huh?

07:54.762 --> 07:56.905
I mean, generally, yes,

07:56.930 --> 07:59.386
but, uh, not quite
sure I'm following here.

07:59.422 --> 08:03.323
Come on, Tandy, can you ever
remember Gail wearing a scarf?

08:04.056 --> 08:06.660
Uh... I don't know.

08:06.695 --> 08:07.928
Well, I do know.

08:07.963 --> 08:09.496
And the answer is no.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.098
She never ever has.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.166
Ever.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.334
Ugh, I knew this would happen.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.769
Care Bear, it's okay.

08:15.805 --> 08:16.937
Knew what would happen?

08:16.972 --> 08:19.239
Missing important life moments.

08:19.805 --> 08:21.241
And this is day one.

08:21.277 --> 08:23.410
I mean, who knows what I'll miss next?

08:23.724 --> 08:25.799
Maybe she'll start cinching her shirts,

08:25.824 --> 08:28.761
or cutting tree nuts out of her diet,

08:28.786 --> 08:31.785
or... yell-sneezing.

08:31.821 --> 08:34.955
I'm sorry, I just... I miss her so much.

08:34.990 --> 08:38.058
Hey, hey, hey. I have an idea.

08:38.094 --> 08:41.039
Why don't you and I pop over
to Gail's and say hi? Huh?

08:41.063 --> 08:42.330
Reconnect.

08:42.464 --> 08:44.097
No, I don't want to bug her.

08:44.133 --> 08:46.533
How much you want to bet
she's over there right now

08:46.569 --> 08:48.836
missing you just as much?

08:51.568 --> 08:53.368
Do you really think so?

08:53.591 --> 08:55.157
I know so.

08:56.309 --> 08:57.408
Let's do it.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.400
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

09:06.021 --> 09:07.387
Mom!

09:07.423 --> 09:08.689
Hi.

09:08.724 --> 09:10.624
Oh!

09:10.659 --> 09:13.127
We just, uh, dropped by to say hi.

09:13.162 --> 09:15.474
Gail, you look like
you haven't aged a day.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.747
It's good to see you.

09:17.772 --> 09:19.466
I got you a little gift.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.734
Um...

09:20.769 --> 09:24.163
It's called a walk and talk machine.

09:24.241 --> 09:26.106
I thought it'd be a great
way to keep in touch.

09:26.142 --> 09:29.009
Okay.

09:30.579 --> 09:32.546
Um...

09:32.581 --> 09:34.381
Uh...

09:35.451 --> 09:37.384
Okay.

09:38.379 --> 09:39.953
- Absolutely.
- You're so funny.

09:41.690 --> 09:44.758
- Yep. - Hey.
- Oh, hey.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.894
You're having a dinner party.

09:46.929 --> 09:48.762
Oh, that's fun.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.764
Without us.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.900
Oh, that's bad.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.937
Oh, well, it's not a big
deal, Carol. It wasn't, like,

09:57.962 --> 10:01.075
- some planned thing.
- Yeah, we had just run out of coconut oil,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.167
and came over to borrow some,

10:02.192 --> 10:04.101
and they invited us in for dinner.

10:04.136 --> 10:07.455
I was gonna come get y'all,
but then I had a glass of wine,

10:07.482 --> 10:09.615
and I just kind of got wine legs.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.417
Uh-huh. Okay.

10:11.452 --> 10:14.987
Come on, Carol. Y'all
live, like, a mile away.

10:15.023 --> 10:16.718
Well, I don't know about wine legs,

10:16.743 --> 10:19.525
but my very pregnant
legs walked that mile.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.877
- Carol...
- No, it's fine.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.413
- Really, it's all good.
- Okay. Why don't y'all

10:24.449 --> 10:26.882
just come on in, sit
down and have something?

10:26.918 --> 10:30.519
Carol Pilbasian-Miller
doesn't crash parties.

10:30.555 --> 10:32.688
She throws them.

10:33.658 --> 10:35.157
- Oh, Carol. - Carol.
- Come on, Carol.

10:35.193 --> 10:36.525
Oh, brother.

10:38.262 --> 10:41.530
You know, we have coconut oil, too.

10:41.566 --> 10:43.532
We have it, too.

10:47.340 --> 10:48.838
Oh, my God.

10:54.994 --> 10:55.978
Ugh.

10:56.013 --> 10:57.313
Hey, Melissa. You know what?

10:57.348 --> 10:59.148
We-we've been going at it all night.

10:59.183 --> 11:00.483
Look, I-I...

11:00.518 --> 11:02.885
Not that I haven't
enjoyed every minute of it,

11:02.920 --> 11:04.553
I just...

11:04.589 --> 11:06.956
You think you could give me a
few minutes to catch my breath?

11:06.991 --> 11:09.024
I'm really dragging here, hon.

11:09.788 --> 11:11.200
Who's this "Melissa"
you're talking about,

11:11.225 --> 11:12.302
you little piece of crap?

11:14.131 --> 11:15.297
Melissa's nobody.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.966
And what's your name?

11:17.001 --> 11:18.968
My name's Spike Sanchez.

11:19.003 --> 11:20.102
And your name's Dirt.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.010
You got that, you little piece of crap?

11:22.035 --> 11:23.427
Yeah, I'm s-I'm sorry, Spike.

11:23.452 --> 11:24.318
My mistake.

11:24.343 --> 11:26.475
You're a mistake, is
what your mother said.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.977
Yep. I'm a big mistake.

11:28.012 --> 11:29.812
My mother never meant to have me.

11:29.847 --> 11:31.313
Shut up and give me your lunch money.

11:31.349 --> 11:34.149
I don't have any lunch money, Spike.

11:34.749 --> 11:38.187
Well, then, I guess we'll have
to find another way to pay.

11:38.222 --> 11:39.887
Take off your pants!

11:39.912 --> 11:42.558
Well, this is all very
confusing, but okay.

11:42.593 --> 11:43.726
Mm.

11:44.795 --> 11:46.428
Can you believe that?

11:46.464 --> 11:47.930
Did she say anything to you?

11:47.965 --> 11:51.000
No, she just left it right
there on the doorstep.

11:51.035 --> 11:52.416
Look, I kind of get it.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.395
Oh, you're gonna take her side on this?

11:54.430 --> 11:55.896
No, I'm always on your side.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.566
I am just saying, she's
extremely pregnant,

11:58.601 --> 12:00.234
her hormones are out of whack

12:00.269 --> 12:04.007
and she's just adjusting
to living without you.

12:04.382 --> 12:07.408
Aw, crap, you're right.

12:10.071 --> 12:12.271
Okay, maybe I should just apologize

12:12.296 --> 12:14.014
so we can move the hell on.

12:14.050 --> 12:15.282
Yeah.

12:15.742 --> 12:17.208
What?

12:17.358 --> 12:20.588
You're just amazing.

12:20.623 --> 12:22.256
- Oh...
- Mm.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.761
- What is that?
- Mom.

12:27.797 --> 12:30.164
Mom!

12:30.985 --> 12:33.000
- Oh, it's a walkie.
- You there?

12:33.035 --> 12:34.969
- Mom!
- I'm here. What's wrong?

12:35.332 --> 12:36.898
Where have you been?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.239
I've been calling for you.

12:38.274 --> 12:39.773
I'm in labor!

12:39.809 --> 12:42.476
- Oh, my God, are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

12:42.512 --> 12:43.644
Where are you?

12:43.679 --> 12:45.479
Uh, uh, I'll be right there.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.780
- You go, I'll meet you there.
- Okay, okay.

12:46.816 --> 12:48.782
- Okay.
- Hurry, Mom!

12:49.555 --> 12:50.614
Mom!

12:50.639 --> 12:53.554
Just hold tight, Carol,
I'm coming as fast as I can.

12:53.589 --> 12:56.357
Hurry, please, I'm so scared.

12:56.392 --> 12:58.192
Keep breathing, I'll be there soon.

12:58.227 --> 12:59.460
Oh, my God, I think it's coming!

12:59.495 --> 13:00.728
It... what do we do, Gail?

13:00.763 --> 13:03.097
Help! I-I don't know
what the hell I'm doing!

13:03.132 --> 13:04.532
- I'm almost there, hon.
- Push, Care Bear,

13:04.567 --> 13:06.500
you got this! Gail, hurry, please!

13:06.536 --> 13:07.668
I think I see the head!

13:07.703 --> 13:08.869
Oh, keep pushing!

13:21.217 --> 13:22.349
Oh.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.987
Oh, Carol.

13:31.193 --> 13:32.493
Where were you?

13:35.429 --> 13:36.964
Are you a fish?

13:37.257 --> 13:39.800
'Cause you just got schooled.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.692
What the hell, Carol?

13:51.748 --> 13:53.714
I just wanted to see if you'd come.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.816
You honestly think I wouldn't come

13:55.852 --> 13:58.177
for my own grandchild's birth?

13:58.202 --> 14:00.403
I honestly don't know anymore.

14:01.052 --> 14:02.423
Carol, are you okay?

14:02.458 --> 14:03.824
Where's the baby? Did we miss it?

14:03.860 --> 14:04.992
You all missed it!

14:05.028 --> 14:06.160
Oh, my God!

14:06.195 --> 14:08.072
Oh, honey. It's okay.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.797
Now, if this had been the real thing,

14:09.832 --> 14:11.832
none of you would've been here.

14:11.867 --> 14:14.268
And it'll probably happen a lot faster.

14:14.303 --> 14:17.471
The Pilbasians are notorious for
their cheetah-like birth speeds.

14:17.506 --> 14:19.073
Tandy, are you wearing a diaper?

14:19.108 --> 14:21.342
Yeah, it's called
committing to the role.

14:21.377 --> 14:22.643
Well, you look ridiculous.

14:22.678 --> 14:23.944
This is messed up.

14:23.979 --> 14:26.980
I ran all the way over
here with a week-old baby.

14:27.016 --> 14:28.882
And I haven't slept in, like, 36 hours.

14:28.918 --> 14:31.385
Okay? I'm hot, I'm dehydrated.

14:31.420 --> 14:33.173
I mean, this is literally
the last thing I needed.

14:33.198 --> 14:34.310
Thanks a lot, guys, really.

14:34.335 --> 14:35.501
You're welcome.

14:35.526 --> 14:36.690
Come on, Todd, back to it.

14:36.726 --> 14:38.692
Yes, Mistress Celeste.

14:38.728 --> 14:40.861
Ah.

14:40.896 --> 14:42.391
Oh, Gail.

14:44.485 --> 14:47.511
Well, that was not received well.

14:47.758 --> 14:49.795
But I think they got the message.

14:49.820 --> 14:51.605
Well, we had to prove our point.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.275
And a point always hurts
because it's so sharp.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.947
I can't believe I had
to untie you for that.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.049
Please, just give me a sec.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.519
You okay?

15:06.800 --> 15:07.721
Yeah.

15:07.757 --> 15:09.563
Look, I'm-I'm just gonna
pop over to the store

15:09.588 --> 15:11.009
and get some more energy drinks.

15:11.034 --> 15:13.060
Okay. Hurry back.

15:13.095 --> 15:14.438
Yeah.

15:19.268 --> 15:21.201
Look at that diagram.

15:21.237 --> 15:22.903
Yeah.

15:22.938 --> 15:24.438
It's beautiful.

15:24.473 --> 15:26.640
So that's the pelvis.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.093
Hey, Carol. You there, hon?

15:29.118 --> 15:31.078
Look, I've thought things through,

15:31.113 --> 15:33.514
and I realize that maybe you were right.

15:33.549 --> 15:35.382
I-I don't know what I was thinking,

15:35.418 --> 15:37.317
but bottom line,

15:37.353 --> 15:40.320
I owe you a big fat apology.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.688
So what do you say?

15:41.724 --> 15:43.290
Will you accept my...

15:46.929 --> 15:50.197
Mom. Mom, are you all right?

15:50.232 --> 15:51.832
No, Carol.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.400
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:53.436 --> 15:56.437
I was walking and I fell down a well.

15:56.472 --> 16:00.274
Oh, God. There's a whole bunch
of spiders and snakes down here.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.157
- Good one, Gail.
- I'm in trouble too, guys.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.216
I just stepped on a bear trap. No!

16:09.251 --> 16:11.618
Oh, the pain.

16:11.654 --> 16:15.122
Dawn, crawl for help.

16:15.157 --> 16:17.891
A bunch of damn snakes just bit me.

16:19.370 --> 16:20.627
I don't know how many.

16:20.663 --> 16:23.093
I lost count after 20.

16:23.118 --> 16:26.300
I'm bleeding like
Niagara Falls over here.

16:26.335 --> 16:27.534
Oh. Oh, God.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.036
How dare they?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.471
Faking a birth is one thing,

16:30.506 --> 16:32.272
but falling down a snake well

16:32.308 --> 16:34.141
and getting caught in a
bear trap, respectively,

16:34.176 --> 16:35.676
are no laughing matters.

16:35.711 --> 16:37.711
Yeah. Lost a cousin
to a bear trap. Yeah.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.375
Guys, something's wrong.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.348
My heart is racing like crazy.

16:41.383 --> 16:43.450
Yes. Todd.

16:43.486 --> 16:46.086
Oh, guys. When it rains it pour...

16:46.121 --> 16:47.254
Todd, I need help, too.

16:47.289 --> 16:48.922
I'm being attacked by chupacabras.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.591
I think I'm having a heart attack.

16:50.626 --> 16:53.653
- I'm in the store. I'm in the
queso fundido aisle. - No.

16:53.678 --> 16:56.028
I wish I was having a heart attack

16:56.053 --> 16:57.431
because these chupacabra's fangs

16:57.466 --> 16:59.333
- are like meat cleavers.
- Melissa.

16:59.368 --> 17:01.702
No, somebody, quick. I
need like a dulling agent,

17:01.737 --> 17:04.238
- or chupacabra repellant quick.
- Melissa.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.089
Wisconsin.

17:07.410 --> 17:08.742
What?

17:08.777 --> 17:10.978
Todd, what did you say?

17:11.417 --> 17:12.522
Wisconsin.

17:12.548 --> 17:14.448
Wisconsin. Oh, my God, Todd.

17:18.248 --> 17:20.892
Todd! Todd!

17:25.861 --> 17:27.426
Todd!

17:31.000 --> 17:32.466
Todd!

17:32.712 --> 17:35.233
Todd! Todd, wake up.

17:36.569 --> 17:37.698
Todd, wake up.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.256
Wake up, Todd.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.205
Guys, please come help.

17:41.230 --> 17:42.345
I don't know what's wrong with him.

17:42.370 --> 17:43.781
I think Todd had a heart attack.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.582
Dawn just crawled into a baby bear trap.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.873
Guys! This is real!

17:47.909 --> 17:49.742
He won't wake up. I
don't know what to do.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.510
You have to help. We're at the store.

17:51.546 --> 17:54.413
- Oh, my God.
- We're on our way, hon.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.948
You were right to turn it off.

17:55.983 --> 17:59.051
Oh, they went past the
acceptable level of lying.

17:59.087 --> 18:01.020
Like a golf ball on a parking lot,

18:01.055 --> 18:03.155
- a bad lie.
- Mm-hmm.

18:04.559 --> 18:06.025
Well, look who came crawling back.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.693
Shut up, Carol. We need oxygen

18:07.729 --> 18:10.663
- and a heart monitor right now!
- Yeah, okay. I'm on it.

18:13.735 --> 18:15.301
- Okay.
- Ready?

18:15.336 --> 18:18.337
One, two, three.

18:20.508 --> 18:23.309
- Okay, what do we do?
- I already did chest compressions

18:23.344 --> 18:24.643
and got him to swallow an aspirin,

18:24.679 --> 18:26.489
so hopefully, that'll help.

18:26.514 --> 18:28.613
This is all my fault. I
shouldn't have done any of it.

18:28.638 --> 18:29.737
No, this is my fault.

18:29.762 --> 18:30.750
I pushed him too hard.

18:30.785 --> 18:32.418
I thought we were having fun.

18:32.453 --> 18:33.819
This is all of our fault,

18:33.855 --> 18:36.055
and none of our fault. It just is.

18:36.864 --> 18:38.290
God, why isn't that thing working?

18:38.326 --> 18:39.730
It takes a minute to kick in.

18:39.755 --> 18:41.925
- Is the generator going?
- Yes, it's on.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.538
Okay.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.733
Come on. Come on.

18:49.971 --> 18:51.570
Come on.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.145
That's a good sign.

19:04.318 --> 19:07.019
Todd.

19:07.584 --> 19:09.989
Todd, can you hear me?

19:12.732 --> 19:14.593
Mistress Celeste?

19:14.629 --> 19:18.097
Oh, my...

19:24.650 --> 19:27.651
Must've been all those
energy drinks I drank.

19:27.722 --> 19:30.142
But I'm okay now.

19:30.178 --> 19:31.644
I'll go get you some water.

19:31.679 --> 19:33.446
Oh, thanks, hon.

19:35.618 --> 19:37.383
Hi.

19:37.875 --> 19:40.152
Brows are really coming back, bud.

19:40.188 --> 19:42.555
Yeah. I guess we're both in recovery.

19:44.019 --> 19:45.658
Glad you're still here, bud.

19:46.365 --> 19:48.260
I, myself, have never reached the point

19:48.296 --> 19:50.310
of overexertion during sex,

19:50.335 --> 19:54.010
you know, due to Carol's problem
with, uh, "finishing early."

19:54.035 --> 19:56.569
- Yeah.
- Oh, don't tell Carol I said that.

19:56.604 --> 19:58.175
She's embarrassed, but, uh,

19:58.200 --> 20:00.534
y-you can tell the others if you want.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.174
Okay.

20:05.308 --> 20:07.446
Oh, my God.

20:09.011 --> 20:12.351
- Look at this ragtag crew.
- Mmm.

20:12.386 --> 20:15.354
Bunch of misfits.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.046
I mean,

20:17.071 --> 20:18.724
we're not always great together,

20:18.759 --> 20:22.328
but clearly, we're much worse apart.

20:24.699 --> 20:27.800
Mom, are you saying what
I think you're saying?

20:29.710 --> 20:32.204
Oh, my gol!

20:35.376 --> 20:36.542
But,

20:36.577 --> 20:37.843
under one condition.

20:37.879 --> 20:39.211
If we're all gonna live together,

20:39.247 --> 20:41.714
it's definitely not gonna
be in this crap hole.

20:41.749 --> 20:46.018
Okay. Let's go ask the others.
