WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:08.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:12.200 --> 01:14.160
SANTA IS LYING

01:14.240 --> 01:18.600
SCHOOL

01:18.680 --> 01:24.080
In 1995, I had the life of a mollusk
washed up on the back row.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.280
I remember I always had
my chin resting on my arm,

01:27.360 --> 01:31.240
and all I could see was
a slice of window and a streetlamp.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.600
I was Ms. Mazzetti's pet student.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.240
Even if I didn't do shit, I thought
I was smart, and that made me arrogant.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.680
I can do what I like because I'm clever.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.480
Everything works out for me.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.360
Maybe once I'm 18
I'll get American citizenship

01:45.440 --> 01:46.760
and run for president.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.800
How arrogant can a kid get

01:48.880 --> 01:52.280
just because he can draw a triangle
and his mom tells everyone…

01:52.360 --> 01:53.640
He's so clever.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.840
He even learned
how not to choke on ham fat.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.320
One day at school, it felt like any other,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.680
and then an abyss opened up

02:01.760 --> 02:05.440
and from the depths of Hell,
divisions and fractions emerged.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.360
Then I knew.
If I wanted to be known as a clever kid,

02:08.440 --> 02:09.960
I'd have to die at 12.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.120
Possibly before the mid-March exams.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.880
But I didn't die and I started
a ritual of weekly humiliation.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.280
I still remember Ms. Mazzetti's words
with a broken heart.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.960
Last term you did so well!

02:23.040 --> 02:26.120
What happened? Why did you stop studying?

02:26.200 --> 02:28.240
I expected more from you.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.240
I wanted to say…

02:29.320 --> 02:31.440
I didn't stop. I just don't get this!

02:31.520 --> 02:33.520
I'm an idiot, okay? What can I do?

02:33.600 --> 02:35.320
Why make me feel guilty?

02:35.400 --> 02:38.480
Why does my stupidity
have to be a disappointment to you?

02:39.080 --> 02:41.360
Now I feel like an idiot and a monster

02:41.440 --> 02:45.000
for causing grief to a woman
who had put so much hope in me.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.080
My conscience had already
manifested itself as an armadillo

02:51.160 --> 02:52.480
who every day told me…

02:52.560 --> 02:54.120
Look how sad she is.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.960
Tonight, she'll think
about your failure to answer correctly

02:58.040 --> 03:00.160
and she'll get drunk to forget it.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.040
She'll keep drinking herself into oblivion

03:03.120 --> 03:05.920
and she'll crash
into a frozen foods truck.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.320
At her funeral they'll say…

03:07.400 --> 03:08.760
She was never the same

03:08.840 --> 03:12.440
after that shitty child
failed to understand fractions.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.840
It became an obsession.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.800
I was overcome by stress
every time I was asked a question.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.440
I spent weeks trying
to win back her approval.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.360
Besides the armadillo
I only spoke to two people,

03:25.440 --> 03:29.360
who were at the opposite ends
of the the classroom food chain.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.840
Secco, the greatest loser
of all school losers.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.960
If society was the Titanic,

03:34.040 --> 03:37.280
he would be eating potatoes
with the Irish and the mice.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.480
And Sarah, who couldn't
understand my anguish

03:39.560 --> 03:42.240
because she was a fucking nerd
with top marks.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.120
I remember one particular test.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.320
Secco and I were bottom of the class
and I asked him…

03:48.400 --> 03:51.720
For fudge's sake, don't you understand
that we've disappointed her?

03:51.800 --> 03:55.320
How can you live with yourself,
knowing you caused such pain?

03:58.840 --> 04:01.120
I don't give a shit.
Wanna get an ice cream?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.400
How can it be? Don't you feel anything

04:03.480 --> 04:05.760
for that poor lady?
She could be our mother!

04:05.840 --> 04:07.800
Don't you feel bad for disappointing her?

04:07.880 --> 04:10.080
I don't give a shit.
Wanna get an ice cream?

04:10.160 --> 04:13.040
Now I understand,
Secco wasn't disappointing anybody.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.160
Ms. Mazzetti
never expected anything of him.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.720
She never even asked him a question.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.280
She looked at him
like you look at mold in an elevator.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.880
It bothers you,
but it's not up to you to clean it.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.680
That's why when we left school,
everything felt normal.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.240
We were chatting away,

04:32.320 --> 04:35.160
Ms. Mazzetti drove past us
on her way home, and…

04:36.200 --> 04:37.840
A massive explosion!

04:37.920 --> 04:40.000
It was 1995,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.040
this was a very big deal.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.520
We were still in shock
after the Capaci bombing.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.640
But no!

04:46.720 --> 04:50.080
It was Secco
lighting up some firecrackers.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.680
-Sarah and I told him…
-Are you crazy?

04:51.760 --> 04:53.920
What have you done? Run!

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
We did run,
but we got caught and suspended.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.760
Even though us two had done nothing,
and I remember telling Sarah…

05:00.840 --> 05:03.000
At least now you know how it feels

05:03.080 --> 05:05.240
to disappoint someone who cares about you.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.240
Sorry you had to find out this way.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.160
Enough, Ze'!

05:09.240 --> 05:13.160
Ms. Mazzetti doesn't care
about you, me, us!

05:13.240 --> 05:15.240
She has a son, it's not you!

05:15.320 --> 05:18.960
That idiot goes to singing competitions
dressed up as a goth.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.960
You're just work, one of hundreds of kids.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.880
She has met many before you
and will meet many after.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.920
Have you noticed
that she calls you "Zeno"?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.600
Yes. But many people do, it sounds better.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.960
No, she's confused.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.640
She thinks you're Zeno Ventriglia.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.280
The kid in 3B?

05:35.360 --> 05:37.400
The farting hunchback?

05:37.480 --> 05:39.000
I was devastated.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.160
How can she confuse me with him?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.880
You are not omnipotent.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.160
You are not the center of her world.

05:45.240 --> 05:49.760
We see her sitting at her desk
and she's like an obelisk for our lives.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.920
But her own life starts
when she gets out of here.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.280
You're only a number among many others.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.720
Besides your mother, nobody gives a fuck

05:57.800 --> 06:01.200
whether you did well in math or not.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.160
Sarah saw that all that I knew
was crumbling around me.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.920
My face was crumbling too, so she added…

06:08.000 --> 06:10.040
Don't you see how great this is?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.160
You don't have
the world on your shoulders,

06:12.240 --> 06:14.440
you're just a blade of grass in a field.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.360
Don't you feel lighter?

06:16.440 --> 06:18.000
I'm not sure she was right.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.520
Maybe some teachers
are more obsessed by their job.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.960
But that day I do remember

06:23.040 --> 06:26.400
feeling somehow relieved
at the thought of being

06:26.480 --> 06:28.120
just a mere blade of grass

06:28.200 --> 06:30.440
that made no difference to anyone,

06:30.520 --> 06:33.600
and couldn't be blamed
for all that was wrong in the world.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.360
A while back, Alice called
and I couldn't answer.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.520
I don't remember what I was doing,
but it was important.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.160
Perhaps I was studying…

07:00.240 --> 07:01.480
GOAT BEATS UP POLICEMAN

07:01.560 --> 07:02.880
Or maybe I was working out.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.280
I had a dream
about the late Fabrizio Frizzi.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.680
He told me that the trick
we used to see on TV

07:07.760 --> 07:10.160
about putting coins on our elbow
and then catching them

07:10.240 --> 07:13.400
might become an Olympic sport
at Paris 2024.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.360
So I have been training hard.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.120
I don't know, okay?
I just didn't feel like talking to her.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.840
Later on something crappy happened,

07:23.920 --> 07:27.160
I don't remember what,
maybe I broke my charger,

07:27.240 --> 07:30.320
and I thought, "I haven't moaned
on Twitter in a while."

07:30.400 --> 07:32.160
I have a master's in Social Media Whining.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.560
I wrote my dissertation

07:33.640 --> 07:36.800
on the difference between
angry moaning about institutions,

07:36.880 --> 07:39.000
a queue at the post office
or a late train,

07:39.080 --> 07:43.640
which turns me into a popular hero,
like Evita Perón and the <i>descamisados,</i>

07:43.720 --> 07:45.400
and the more personal moan

07:45.480 --> 07:49.120
such as, "Today I feel sad,
a little bit melancholic."

07:49.200 --> 07:50.120
Never ever that!

07:50.200 --> 07:53.000
You sound like a loser
who didn't take his meds!

07:53.080 --> 07:56.080
Nobody wants to see your demons,
you pathological liar!

07:56.600 --> 07:58.400
No, those are to be avoided.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.960
At least being bullied at school
taught me that.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.080
But "moaning about phone chargers"

08:03.160 --> 08:05.560
was a rather balanced emotion
shared by many.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.040
I'm about to post…

08:07.840 --> 08:09.920
Are you mad? What if Alice sees it?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.920
She'd know you're right here
playing with your phone.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.560
She'd call back, and then what?

08:15.160 --> 08:17.200
That's true! What would I say?

08:17.280 --> 08:19.400
"I can't speak,
I need to moan on Twitter"?

08:19.480 --> 08:21.000
Mission abort.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.680
And yet, that tweet was phenomenal.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.920
It was funny,
I'd have gotten 800 million likes.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.160
I would have been asked
for the movie rights.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.720
MOAN
FROM A TWEET BY ZEROCALCARE

08:30.800 --> 08:34.080
Now it won't happen because
of that ambushing pain in the ass.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.080
Okay, Alice isn't a pain in the ass,
but now I'm in a mood.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.560
I hate that I can't even check WhatsApp
without her seeing me online.

08:42.640 --> 08:46.120
I can't put a like on Facebook
'cause she might get the notification.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.920
I am powerless!

08:48.000 --> 08:51.120
Now she's messaging me!
I'm under siege from all sides!

08:53.120 --> 08:55.680
A normal person would read
the messages and reply.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.800
But we're now in a Mexican standoff.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.320
I feel like a hunted beast,
I can't think clearly.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.880
I just want to escape this bear trap.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.360
I can't think straight,
so I hold a G2 summit with the armadillo.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.360
The next few hours are crucial.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.400
You must rely on fast forays.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.840
Get ready, take a deep breath,
and then, pow!

09:13.920 --> 09:15.120
You open WhatsApp,

09:15.200 --> 09:16.960
check the photo Secco sent you,

09:17.040 --> 09:18.880
as that must be important

09:18.960 --> 09:21.960
to nourish the national
intellectual debate, then get out.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.360
Don't view any of Alice's messages.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.240
You know nothing. You saw nothing.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.240
You must be able to deny everything,
even in front of a grand jury.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.720
Hit and run. Check out Secco's photo…

09:32.800 --> 09:34.960
of a carp giving a blowjob,

09:35.040 --> 09:38.040
then you return
to the darkness like a rat.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.480
Okay, but until when?
How do we end the standoff?

09:42.520 --> 09:45.800
Until 3:00 a.m.
You set the alarm, get the phone,

09:45.880 --> 09:47.840
read her messages, and reply,

09:47.920 --> 09:50.840
"Sorry, I've just seen this."
And it's done.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.720
She'll be sleeping
and won't see it till the morning.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.440
But tomorrow we'll back to square one.
It's an infinite loop.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.280
Exactly! An infinite loop!
But that's the utopia.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.320
DEAL WITH IT

10:02.400 --> 10:05.120
The philosopher's stone.
We'll deal with tomorrow when it comes.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.640
Worst case scenario,

10:06.720 --> 10:09.360
we keep it vague
and wait until 3:00 a.m. to reply.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.520
And on it goes. For as long as it works.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.440
Pardon me, my dear armadillo,

10:13.520 --> 10:15.720
but perhaps dealing with the issue

10:15.800 --> 10:18.120
might help relieve my unbearable anxiety.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.320
You know, take the bull by the ho--

10:21.400 --> 10:22.880
Shut up. Calm down.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.400
It's Blitzkrieg. The Nazis invented it.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.160
Hitler shot himself for this crap.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.920
You need to maintain your position.
Hold steady.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.200
You'll exhaust the enemy
by exploiting the delays.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.160
Stay in the trenches.

10:40.760 --> 10:44.160
And so I did. I still don't know
what she wanted to tell me.

10:44.240 --> 10:48.360
When we met, we talked about stuff,
and left that in the past.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.080
A shame? Maybe.
But what if she wanted a long convo?

10:52.160 --> 10:54.080
It's a rhetorical question.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.200
Back in Ancient Greece,
men started wondering

10:56.280 --> 10:58.760
whether it was better
to explore the unknown

10:58.840 --> 11:01.640
or to remain ignorant
without being bothered by others.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.920
PLATO'S CAVE

11:06.000 --> 11:09.720
The Greeks were nerds, and if they
didn't figure it out, I certainly won't.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.320
I left school 20 years ago.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.000
Everything is going to plan,
although I smell of piss,

11:26.080 --> 11:27.520
even if Sarah says I don't.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.400
I asked her 600 times.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.360
-Do I smell of piss?
-No.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.040
-Are you sure? I think I do.
-You don't.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.560
But I can smell piss.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.640
It's a neurological issue.
It's like those who see Padre Pio

11:38.720 --> 11:39.960
and smell lavender.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.160
Tell Secco to come down when we call him.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.400
We're on schedule. Actually, we're early.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.160
Everything is going well,
but then, suddenly…

11:51.280 --> 11:52.480
a tire bursts.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.600
Bummer! Of all days,
did this have to happen now?

11:56.680 --> 11:57.760
Are you surprised?

11:57.840 --> 12:01.280
You hit the pavement at full speed.
Not even a tank would have survived.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.080
I choose not to take the bait.
I rise above it.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.000
Luckily I have a spare tire.
Full of vigor, I take the jack,

12:09.080 --> 12:10.840
and I start lifting the car.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.200
I can change a tire,
I've done it 150 times.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.480
You are 37 and cannot do shit,

12:18.560 --> 12:20.840
but now you look like a working class hero

12:20.920 --> 12:24.400
who sweats over heavy work,
covered by grease and soot.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.640
Take a pic, I'll send it to my dad

12:26.720 --> 12:30.160
so he'll know
he hasn't failed as a parent.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.120
I take off the tire like a pro

12:34.200 --> 12:36.160
and I'm about to replace it, but…

12:37.120 --> 12:38.920
the car collapses.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.120
The jack wasn't positioned
correctly underneath it.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.720
And then it gets worse.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.800
I try to lift the car,
but now it's 100 times heavier.

12:46.880 --> 12:51.120
People's admiring looks
have turned to pity.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.520
Look at that sweaty animal,
what a terrible sight!

12:55.600 --> 12:58.640
When they get like that,
it's best to put them to sleep.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.160
The second piece of bad news

13:03.240 --> 13:06.400
is that the old tire was resting
on a bump in the road

13:06.480 --> 13:08.880
and the new tire won't fit.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.960
I need to lift the car further,
but the jack won't work.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.480
So I'm one tire down,
I can't put on the new one,

13:16.560 --> 13:18.080
and I can't move the car.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.120
I wish I could self-combust

13:20.200 --> 13:22.160
and put an end to this misery.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.040
It happens. Let's ask for help.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.760
No! You don't get it!

13:26.840 --> 13:30.080
You could ask for help
as your role in this patriarchal society

13:30.160 --> 13:32.680
is to birth babies and bake cardamom pies.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.800
If you mess up the jack, it looks cute,

13:35.880 --> 13:37.960
like a kitten getting tangled in string.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.360
But as a man, I only have three tasks.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.760
Hunting, commenting on football,
understanding cars.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.880
If I ask for help,

13:44.960 --> 13:47.160
I'm insulting God,
everything that is holy,

13:47.240 --> 13:49.040
and the foundations of this country

13:49.120 --> 13:51.480
that our ancestors
built with blood and tears.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.240
GOD, COUNTRY, AND DIY

13:53.840 --> 13:55.120
I'm now totally paranoid.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.800
It's a giant metaphor
for my lack of sexual prowess.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.360
The jack just won't lift.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.120
The tire won't go in.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.840
It's a total debacle.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.120
Nobody offers help
now that I am an outcast.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.760
Even the Bengali gas station attendant
looks at me in disgust.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.360
Maybe it's because solidarity among losers

14:14.440 --> 14:18.560
is secondary to a rigid fulfillment
of gender roles, or maybe he thinks…

14:18.640 --> 14:20.200
Look at that moron!

14:20.280 --> 14:23.200
He was born with all that white privilege

14:23.280 --> 14:25.080
and yet he's still a moron.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.520
He deserves it. Die, bastard class enemy!

14:28.600 --> 14:30.160
I have to admit total failure

14:30.240 --> 14:32.720
and it's getting late,
so there's only one option,

14:32.800 --> 14:36.320
the emergency welfare assistance tool

14:36.400 --> 14:38.720
that is the backbone of Italy.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.680
My mother.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.640
Mom? I got a flat
and I can't change the tire.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.080
We're gonna miss the train.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.600
Can you come over
and wait for the tow truck?

14:49.640 --> 14:52.600
Parent 1 says yes,
so Sarah and I catch a bus to Secco's.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.800
The Bengali guy's lack of help
is still bothering me a lot.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.400
Then Sarah rightly says…

14:58.480 --> 15:00.920
Why should he be the one to help you?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.080
Does your subconscious think
he has to earn his right to be here

15:04.160 --> 15:05.720
by helping you out?

15:06.240 --> 15:07.680
As a token of gratitude

15:07.760 --> 15:11.880
because our country allows him
to collect the few euros you pay for gas?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.280
I'd like to retort,

15:13.360 --> 15:15.360
but I don't because I know she's right.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.160
My subconscious sucks.
Then I get a text from Mom.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.000
NO TOW TRUCK NEEDED
JUST HAD TO PUSH THE JACK

15:21.080 --> 15:23.960
In the end, asking Mom for help
is a great tradition

15:24.040 --> 15:25.680
of Mediterranean male identity.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.880
MAMA'S BOY

15:26.960 --> 15:30.800
After this humiliation,
I can happily rejoin my community.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.480
