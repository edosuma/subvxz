00:02.160 --> 00:04.080
On this episode of "MythBusters",

00:04.710 --> 00:08.109
Adam and Jamie risk
drowning and dysentery...

00:08.109 --> 00:10.079
This water's disgusting!

00:10.080 --> 00:12.179
...by testing the voracity

00:12.180 --> 00:15.279
of this multi-million-hit viral video.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.250
That was very light-footed!

00:18.990 --> 00:22.359
Can man, woman, or a sporting superstar

00:22.360 --> 00:25.589
actually manage to briefly run on water?

00:25.590 --> 00:28.160
I'm more nervous of this
than I was at the olympics.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.859
Meantime, Kari, Tory, and Grant

00:30.860 --> 00:33.149
try blasting a supposedly survivable

00:33.150 --> 00:35.179
action-movie stunt.

00:35.341 --> 00:38.220
- Well, that was definitely a death zone.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:38.610 --> 00:40.939
When you're desperately diving for cover,

00:40.940 --> 00:44.779
just what is and what isn't bombproof?

00:44.780 --> 00:46.650
You'd probably be bleeding from your ears,

00:46.660 --> 00:47.820
but it is bombproof.

00:53.790 --> 00:55.590
Who are the MythBusters?

00:56.290 --> 00:57.339
Adam Savage...

00:57.340 --> 00:59.289
That's 100% wacky right there.

00:59.290 --> 01:00.730
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:01.930 --> 01:06.310
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:06.870 --> 01:08.139
Joining them,

01:08.140 --> 01:09.649
Tory Belleci...

01:09.650 --> 01:11.399
Let's torch this thing!

01:11.400 --> 01:12.669
...Grant Imahara...

01:12.670 --> 01:13.808
It's lethal, people!

01:13.809 --> 01:15.058
...and Kari Byron.

01:15.059 --> 01:16.108
I'm starting to get the idea

01:16.109 --> 01:17.610
that this shouldn't be done inside.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.410
They don't just tell the myths,

01:20.780 --> 01:22.940
they put them to the test.

01:22.965 --> 01:24.965
MythBusters 9x03 - Running on Water
Original air date April 20, 2011

01:27.360 --> 01:32.059
First up, a myth that seems
to defy the laws of physics.

01:32.060 --> 01:35.829
Jamie, there's a viral video
we absolutely have to test.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.000
Double rainbow?

01:37.001 --> 01:39.529
No. This is some dudes
by the side of a lake

01:39.530 --> 01:41.500
wearing shoes they say are water-repellant,

01:41.501 --> 01:44.829
and then they proceed to run on the water.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.559
They actually run across
the surface of the water

01:47.560 --> 01:48.600
in these shoes.

01:48.601 --> 01:49.929
I'm dubious.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.959
And that's why we're interested in this.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.630
Let's roll the videotape!

01:55.220 --> 01:59.289
This is the clip that's got more
than 7 million online viewers

01:59.290 --> 02:01.109
rethinking what they thought

02:01.110 --> 02:03.440
they knew about, well, sinking.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.160
There's not a whole lot to it.

02:05.161 --> 02:07.639
Strap on a pair of waterproof shoes,

02:07.640 --> 02:10.628
run on a curve to enhance
the skimming effect,

02:10.630 --> 02:14.759
and keep the faith for a dozen
adrenaline-fueled strides.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.888
I think if you don't actually believe

02:15.889 --> 02:17.178
that you're gonna walk on that water,

02:17.179 --> 02:18.630
it's not gonna happen for you.

02:18.631 --> 02:21.229
They call it "liquid mountaineering".

02:21.230 --> 02:24.779
But is this approach to
temporarily walking on water

02:24.780 --> 02:26.839
a myth or a miracle?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.790
What do you think?
Should we just go for it?

02:28.791 --> 02:30.979
I think so. Let's find ourselves a lake

02:30.980 --> 02:34.179
and replicate exactly what we
see them doing in that clip.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.810
- Works for me.
- Okay.

02:36.150 --> 02:39.129
Finding a lake that looks
much like the one in the clip

02:39.130 --> 02:40.420
is the easy part.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.980
Now it's time to run on the water.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.119
Adam's optimism should be infectious.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.729
But over the years, Jamie's
built up a natural resistance.

02:52.730 --> 02:55.799
According to the clip, this
is all about the shoe.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.209
They're hydrophobic, which
means they repel water.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.679
We've got the same type of shoe,

03:01.680 --> 03:04.569
and they do seem to repel water.

03:04.570 --> 03:05.830
Whether that translates

03:05.831 --> 03:08.890
to me being able to run
across a lake or something...?

03:09.210 --> 03:11.469
Let's just say I think
I'm going for a swim.

03:11.470 --> 03:13.289
According to the viral video,

03:13.290 --> 03:15.659
Jamie needs to hit the water at speed.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.999
And the turf should ensure traction

03:18.000 --> 03:20.020
right down to the lake's edge.

03:20.310 --> 03:22.839
You know, in the clip,
they talk significantly

03:22.840 --> 03:24.570
about the curve that you
enter the water in,

03:24.571 --> 03:27.379
like on a long arc, and about believing.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.680
You believe? You believe you can do it?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.920
I'm right there. You know me.

03:32.900 --> 03:33.830
All right.

03:33.850 --> 03:35.720
All right, here we go.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.429
So much for focus.

03:39.430 --> 03:42.789
But maybe it does all
come down to self-belief.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.680
Three, two, one, go!

03:53.850 --> 03:55.750
Or maybe not.

03:56.580 --> 03:59.719
These shoes don't repel water well enough

03:59.720 --> 04:01.639
to keep me on top of the water.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.270
I just sort of ran into the water,

04:04.280 --> 04:06.870
and that's all there is to it.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.390
All right, come on out.
I want to give it a shot.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.589
So, any words of advice?

04:12.590 --> 04:13.520
Keep your mouth closed.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.219
It's sort of like "au jus
de duck poop" in there.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.649
Oh, God!

04:17.660 --> 04:18.890
No problem.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.730
Adam's instincts tell him

04:21.731 --> 04:24.889
a longer run-up might
yield a better result.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.160
Okay, I'm ready.

04:26.530 --> 04:30.890
In three, two, one, go!

04:35.770 --> 04:38.209
You really can't fault the execution.

04:38.210 --> 04:39.460
In fact, Adam's effort

04:39.461 --> 04:41.669
looked just like the ones in the video...

04:41.670 --> 04:43.030
except for the end bit.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.599
This water's disgusting!

04:48.600 --> 04:51.599
So, did you feel like you
were on top of the water?

04:51.600 --> 04:54.039
I mean, 'cause you didn't
really look like it.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.099
I felt like I was getting
some good leg motion,

04:56.100 --> 04:58.720
like, "pat, pat, pat" on the ground.

04:59.330 --> 05:03.440
And then my foot hit the water,
and it just kept going.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.139
Apparently, the technique does
take some getting used to.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.939
So I'm gonna give it another go.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.270
Knock yourself out.

05:10.820 --> 05:13.709
They both decide to continue the test,

05:13.710 --> 05:16.950
desperate to take at
least one step on water.

05:20.390 --> 05:23.430
This continues to not work.

05:24.340 --> 05:28.710
Every single attempt ends
with a splash and a crash.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.529
Well, that was a spectacular failure.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.030
Yeah, these shoes are gonna have to have

05:33.031 --> 05:35.249
a lot more going for them
than water-repellence

05:35.250 --> 05:36.270
for that to work.

05:36.271 --> 05:37.450
True enough.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.370
Now to a myth

05:42.371 --> 05:46.040
that takes self-preservation
to its natural conclusion.

05:46.290 --> 05:47.780
All right, so, as you guys know,

05:47.781 --> 05:49.359
and you guys definitely know,

05:49.360 --> 05:51.279
we have tested a ton of myths

05:51.280 --> 05:53.118
where we have taken everyday objects

05:53.119 --> 05:54.410
to see if they're bulletproof.

05:54.411 --> 05:56.229
Like laptops, sheriff badges...

05:56.230 --> 05:56.790
Yep.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.689
And we've also done an episode

05:58.690 --> 06:00.829
on what is supposedly stabproof.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.159
- Like money.
- Exactly.

06:02.160 --> 06:02.728
But you know what?

06:02.729 --> 06:03.970
This one is gonna trump them all.

06:03.971 --> 06:07.870
We're taking everyday objects
to see if they're bombproof.

06:09.180 --> 06:11.199
And those everyday objects,

06:11.200 --> 06:14.000
as suggested by you, the fans, are...

06:14.010 --> 06:18.109
a table, a car, a wall, and a dumpster,

06:18.110 --> 06:20.990
all four inspired by Hollywood.

06:22.810 --> 06:26.550
It's the kind of stuff you see
all the time in action movies.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.649
Moments before a bomb blast,

06:29.650 --> 06:32.630
the hero leaps to safety
behind a parked car.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.830
The heroine is just close enough
to reach that cinder-block wall.

06:38.510 --> 06:39.889
Or the sidekick,

06:39.890 --> 06:42.139
who's still got a snappy
line or two left in him,

06:42.140 --> 06:44.710
finds refuge in the refuse.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.349
But we want to know if any
of these suburban shields

06:48.350 --> 06:50.540
could really save your bacon.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.669
Okay, for the "explosive du
jour", how about we use C4?

06:54.670 --> 06:56.679
That's used in a lot of
Hollywood explosions.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.500
Sounds great.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.549
And first, we should do a control blast

06:59.550 --> 07:00.998
to establish the injury zone.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.858
Then, we can start bringing
objects one by one

07:02.859 --> 07:03.828
to see if they're bombproof.

07:03.829 --> 07:05.320
All right, well, the maximum amount of C4

07:05.321 --> 07:07.569
we can use at the bomb range is 3 pounds.

07:07.570 --> 07:09.609
That is a gonna be a huge blast.

07:09.610 --> 07:11.280
This is gonna be a cool experiment.

07:11.281 --> 07:13.400
You have no idea how right you are.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.119
For the whole team, this shapes up

07:17.120 --> 07:19.780
as a pretty sweet day at the office.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.090
"What's bombproof"?...

07:21.091 --> 07:23.590
I can't believe we haven't
though of this one before.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.068
The first thing to work out

07:25.069 --> 07:26.530
is the perfect test distance

07:26.531 --> 07:28.779
between the bomb and the shields.

07:28.780 --> 07:32.949
Too close, and the whole
experiment just blows to pieces.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.259
Too far away,

07:34.260 --> 07:37.680
and the shock wave might not
be lethal in the first place.

07:37.740 --> 07:40.289
So this will take some finessing.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.930
Come on, Byron. Hurry up.
We don't have all day.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.849
Now, we're gonna set up a number of radii

07:45.850 --> 07:48.319
from the epicenter of the blast.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.930
At each of these radii, we're
gonna put two burst disks,

07:50.940 --> 07:52.799
one that goes at 13,

07:52.800 --> 07:53.910
which is the threshold of injury,

07:53.911 --> 07:55.549
and one that goes at 75,

07:55.550 --> 07:57.850
which is the threshold of instant death.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.640
We've used burst disks before on the show,

08:00.650 --> 08:03.589
to find out if various shock
waves were survivable,

08:03.590 --> 08:07.030
without actually resorting
to a human sacrifice.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.569
So, in this control blast, they're
testing the outer limits

08:11.570 --> 08:14.459
of two differently calibrated disks...

08:14.460 --> 08:18.179
one set for certain death,
the other for injury.

08:18.180 --> 08:21.109
Up to some point, once the blast goes off,

08:21.110 --> 08:22.578
these are all gonna burst.

08:22.579 --> 08:24.480
At the point where they don't burst,

08:24.481 --> 08:26.989
inside of that radius is injury.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.529
Outside of it is the safe zone.

08:28.530 --> 08:29.810
And identical on the other side...

08:29.811 --> 08:33.039
Inside of the death radius
means instant death.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.149
3 pounds C4.

08:36.150 --> 08:37.350
All right, you guys ready to see

08:37.351 --> 08:39.519
how much damage this shock wave can do?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.129
Absolutely.

08:41.130 --> 08:42.179
Charging.

08:42.179 --> 08:44.860
In three, two, one...

08:47.860 --> 08:49.649
That was a nice thud.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.540
That was a good one.
Let's go check our disks.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.508
3 pounds of C4 is the most

08:55.509 --> 08:57.298
we can actually use at the bomb range.

08:57.299 --> 08:58.300
And I can see why.

08:58.301 --> 09:01.669
That is a nice, high-powered,
destructive explosion.

09:01.670 --> 09:04.309
We got a beautiful, quick poof of orange,

09:04.310 --> 09:09.039
and then nice, clear kind
of sheer destructive blast.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.879
Destructive is right.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.889
All that's left of the C4 spike is a stump.

09:14.890 --> 09:17.519
All right, so, death side first.
What do we got?

09:17.520 --> 09:19.669
We are bursting at 10 feet.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.758
So if you're anywhere zero
to 10 feet from the blast,

09:21.759 --> 09:22.250
you're dead.

09:22.251 --> 09:23.609
In the staggered arc,

09:23.610 --> 09:26.589
the 10-foot disk was the
farthest one to burst.

09:26.590 --> 09:30.519
The disks at 11 feet and
beyond stayed intact.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.419
So they've got their range.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.910
All right, let's check injury.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.339
As the shock wave expands,

09:37.340 --> 09:41.930
the chance of death, as you'd
expect, decreases with distance.

09:42.260 --> 09:43.919
Uh, look at all these ruptures.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.049
So this is the 20-foot marker.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.150
All the way through.

09:47.151 --> 09:50.189
All right. So that's the injury radius.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.099
Zero to 20 feet... you're getting injured.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.129
Once again, they've got their range

09:55.130 --> 09:59.250
by noting that the next disk,
at 21 feet, didn't burst.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.369
So these are the blast boundaries...

10:02.370 --> 10:07.169
just inside 10 feet for certain
death, and inside 20 for injury.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.849
But could everyday objects
placed on the edge of the zones

10:10.850 --> 10:12.900
really save life and limb?

10:13.820 --> 10:17.830
There's just one way to test it,
and that's by blowing stuff up.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.439
After the break, Adam and
Jamie see if sheer speed

10:24.440 --> 10:27.860
can enhance your
running-on-water experience.

10:28.130 --> 10:28.940
Go!

10:35.950 --> 10:40.609
Having totally failed to skip across
a lake like a well-pitched stone,

10:40.610 --> 10:43.690
Adam and Jamie have reverted to plan "B".

10:46.440 --> 10:48.830
On your marks, get set...

10:51.380 --> 10:53.980
And plan "B" is a beauty.

10:54.730 --> 10:57.140
Now, if successfully running on
the water is depending on speed,

10:57.141 --> 10:58.729
we need someone really fast,

10:58.730 --> 11:01.329
and that's where Wallace Spearmon,
behind me, comes into the picture.

11:01.330 --> 11:03.079
His 6'3", 170 pounds,

11:03.080 --> 11:06.059
and he's run the 200
meters in 19.65 seconds,

11:06.060 --> 11:09.039
making him the 5th-fastest person
in the world at that distance

11:09.040 --> 11:11.599
and the perfect test subject for us.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.200
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

11:13.201 --> 11:14.819
If speed's the missing ingredient,

11:14.820 --> 11:16.319
that's what Wallace has brought.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.979
They figure that lightning speed

11:17.980 --> 11:20.039
might well be the key to success.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.939
And this man also runs the 100
meters in under 10 seconds.

11:24.940 --> 11:26.880
So, Wallace, how far do you
think you're gonna get?

11:26.881 --> 11:28.619
I'm hoping three steps.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.400
Just three steps?

11:29.401 --> 11:31.490
I'm fast, but I don't
know if I'm that fast.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.289
- We'll see.
- Okay.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.469
This test is mostly about speed.

11:35.470 --> 11:38.799
And Wallace is pretty fast... on land.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.689
However, when Wallace moves from
the land and into the water,

11:41.690 --> 11:44.199
he's not gonna have the
same kind of traction,

11:44.200 --> 11:47.500
and that means he's gonna
slow down really quickly.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.750
I'm more nervous of this
than I was at the Olympics.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.959
And fair enough...

11:52.960 --> 11:56.609
even the Olympics can't
compare to walking on water.

11:56.610 --> 11:59.799
So, let's see if sheer speed is the answer.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.730
Three, two, one, go!

12:06.550 --> 12:08.470
Apparently not.

12:09.130 --> 12:10.340
It's cold.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.519
He didn't seem to do any better
than any of our other tests.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.689
No, his first step on the water

12:17.690 --> 12:19.480
actually was quite a bit further out,

12:19.481 --> 12:21.069
- Yeap.
- but once it touched the water,

12:21.070 --> 12:23.230
it went down, same as the rest of us.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.469
But Spearmon Junior
hasn't come all this way

12:26.470 --> 12:28.960
to pick up his towel and run home.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.100
Take off.

12:30.101 --> 12:33.710
In three, two, one, go!

12:35.000 --> 12:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:43.950 --> 12:45.100
I don't think it's working, guys.

12:45.101 --> 12:46.409
Try harder.

12:46.410 --> 12:47.720
I got you, coach.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.609
Wallace has also seen the viral video.

12:50.610 --> 12:52.499
And just like Jamie and Adam,

12:52.500 --> 12:54.420
he's become obsessed with the thought

12:54.421 --> 12:58.099
that a minor miracle might
be only a quick step away.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.780
- He's not quitting.
- Nope.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.240
You know, one of the things

13:01.241 --> 13:03.689
that they talked about
extensively in the video

13:03.690 --> 13:06.909
was how much you had to
want it to run on the water.

13:06.910 --> 13:10.079
And Wallace did a fantastic job with that.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.010
He talked to us about it.

13:11.011 --> 13:13.049
He really wanted to make this work.

13:13.050 --> 13:14.198
He thought about his stride.

13:14.199 --> 13:15.620
He thought about the way his
feet were hitting the water.

13:15.621 --> 13:18.229
And he gave it every chance he could.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.479
And it was still a total bust.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.559
I want this.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.019
So it turns out speed's not everything.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.709
Maybe if we got Wallace up
to about 100 miles an hour,

13:26.710 --> 13:29.220
he'd skip across the lake like a rock.

13:30.370 --> 13:33.299
But given that humans can only run

13:33.300 --> 13:36.950
up to about 30 miles an
hour, it's not happening.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.759
All right, so, we've done our control test.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.839
And it turns out if you are 10 feet away

13:45.840 --> 13:48.769
from 3 pounds of C4 exploding, you're dead.

13:48.770 --> 13:51.669
If you're 20 feet away, you're
gonna be pretty messed up.

13:51.670 --> 13:53.959
Now that we've established those distances,

13:53.960 --> 13:56.149
we're gonna see if hiding behind an object

13:56.150 --> 13:58.080
can protect you from the blast wave.

13:58.610 --> 14:00.089
And the first object

14:00.090 --> 14:02.399
might not be your first choice of shelter,

14:02.400 --> 14:04.099
assuming you had a choice.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.820
That's because it's a plain wooden table.

14:07.910 --> 14:10.009
I don't know, I don't think
I'd want to be 10 feet away

14:10.010 --> 14:12.649
from 3 pounds of C4, behind just a table.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.809
Oh, come on. That's 3/4-inch pine.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.679
Yeah, it does seem kind of flimsy, eh?

14:16.680 --> 14:19.700
We'll find out how flimsy
in just a few minutes.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.219
Grant plants the burst
disk behind the pine,

14:23.220 --> 14:27.280
as Kari and Tory deliver a
twin for the 20-foot test.

14:28.270 --> 14:29.990
All right, let's point
it towards the blast.

14:29.991 --> 14:32.009
This is the injury zone.

14:32.010 --> 14:33.649
All right. Get in there.

14:33.650 --> 14:35.559
Given the likelihood of shrapnel,

14:35.560 --> 14:39.679
foam figures are added to catch
any potentially fatal shards.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.940
But the way Grant sees it,
that's not the main threat.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.859
So, when we're looking
at what is bombproof,

14:45.860 --> 14:47.180
what we're actually looking at

14:47.181 --> 14:49.949
is a branch of physics
called fluid dynamics,

14:49.950 --> 14:51.650
because we're looking
at the movement of air,

14:51.651 --> 14:53.350
and air is technically a fluid.

14:53.580 --> 14:56.619
Now, when you set off a
high explosive such as C4,

14:56.620 --> 14:57.760
what it does is create

14:57.761 --> 15:01.479
a high-velocity, high-pressure wave of air.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.608
And that high pressure

15:02.609 --> 15:04.440
is potentially what is deadly to you.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.939
With one table just 10
feet from ground zero,

15:07.940 --> 15:10.419
and the other a scant 20...

15:10.420 --> 15:13.559
13 PSI for the injury zone.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.329
...it's a test that seems
certain to end in splinters.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.759
Unprotected,

15:18.760 --> 15:21.819
we know that a blast of C4
would ruin your health.

15:21.820 --> 15:25.950
Now, to see if a simple
pine table can save you.

15:26.750 --> 15:30.830
Okay, this is "what is
bombproof? - wooden table".

15:31.060 --> 15:32.949
All right, charging.

15:32.950 --> 15:36.450
In three, two, one...

15:40.710 --> 15:42.709
Well, that was definitely a death zone.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.679
Now, one table is down,

15:44.680 --> 15:46.578
but the other table is still standing.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.020
Let's go look at the damage!

15:49.940 --> 15:51.329
No prize for guessing

15:51.330 --> 15:55.309
which table is gone, and
which one looks kind of intact.

15:55.310 --> 15:59.469
But the rubble inside the death
zone has a surprise in store.

15:59.470 --> 16:00.628
There's no table left.

16:00.629 --> 16:01.930
The table is completely destroyed!

16:01.931 --> 16:02.999
Oh, my God!

16:03.000 --> 16:06.519
- No way!
- The burst disks are intact!

16:06.520 --> 16:08.809
What the heck? How is that possible?

16:08.810 --> 16:11.540
The table must have deflected
the pressure wave.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.999
That's exactly what it did,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.050
even if Tory finds the
data hard to swallow.

16:17.990 --> 16:21.269
There is no way you would have
come away from this uninjured.

16:21.270 --> 16:24.159
No, but by our criteria,

16:24.160 --> 16:25.510
you would not have instantly died.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.659
Grant makes a good point.

16:29.660 --> 16:32.159
Incredibly, a simple wooden table

16:32.160 --> 16:35.739
made an otherwise fatal
explosion survivable.

16:35.740 --> 16:39.159
Now, to check out the injury
disk at the 20-foot mark.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.639
Okay, well, the table's still standing...

16:41.640 --> 16:43.469
- Let's see.
- ...sort of.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.889
It's not burst.

16:45.890 --> 16:47.150
It's definitely crinkled.

16:47.151 --> 16:50.099
You may have got away without
any injury on this one.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.008
Okay, these results are so interesting.

16:52.009 --> 16:52.908
Let's go check out the high-speed.

16:52.909 --> 16:54.688
I'm dying to see what it looks like.

16:54.689 --> 16:55.490
Me, too.

16:55.491 --> 16:57.749
And it looks like that massive shock wave

16:57.750 --> 16:59.899
was at least interrupted by the table

16:59.900 --> 17:03.280
that Tory quite recently called "flimsy".

17:05.760 --> 17:07.040
Look at the wave.

17:07.670 --> 17:11.450
The disk didn't burst, but
that table is in shreds.

17:12.329 --> 17:15.159
Both tables absorbed
the brunt of the blast.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.279
In the 10-foot death zone, extreme shrapnel

17:18.280 --> 17:20.809
from the shattered wood
might have been fatal,

17:20.810 --> 17:22.449
but the shock wave wouldn't.

17:22.450 --> 17:26.660
And at 20 feet, you will
remain snug and safe.

17:27.770 --> 17:30.009
Up next, replicating a reptile

17:30.010 --> 17:33.120
that has this whole
"water-walk" thing down pat.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.120
Yeah, it's a big tail. So what?

17:41.740 --> 17:42.650
Go!

17:43.350 --> 17:44.980
So far, Adam,...

17:45.740 --> 17:46.999
...and Jamie,...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.289
and a world-class runner

17:49.290 --> 17:52.549
have failed to replicate this viral video.

17:52.550 --> 17:56.010
So, it's time to think outside the box.

17:56.730 --> 17:58.138
Well, we couldn't make it work,

17:58.139 --> 17:59.850
and speed is definitely not a factor,

17:59.851 --> 18:01.479
so where do we go from here?

18:01.480 --> 18:02.820
Well, I think I may have found

18:02.821 --> 18:04.999
the grain of truth at
the heart of this myth.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.419
- Really?
- Really.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.209
It turns out there's a basilisk lizard,

18:09.210 --> 18:11.909
otherwise known as the
"Jesus Christ lizard",

18:11.910 --> 18:14.049
that actually can run on water.

18:14.050 --> 18:16.399
- It can?
- It can.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.899
- Really?
- Really.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.369
Yeah, really.

18:19.370 --> 18:21.339
This remarkable reptile can run

18:21.340 --> 18:24.469
as far as 20 yards across
the water's surface.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.329
And that's just the kind
of inspiration they need

18:27.330 --> 18:30.119
to replicate the results
of the viral video.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.060
All right, it looks like
his feet are actually

18:32.061 --> 18:33.619
slapping the surface of the water,

18:33.620 --> 18:37.329
but they're continuing
to push down and back,

18:37.330 --> 18:39.339
as he's moving along.

18:39.340 --> 18:42.689
Also, he's... it's not like
he's running like this...

18:42.690 --> 18:46.259
he's, like, running with
his legs out, like that...

18:46.260 --> 18:47.930
Yeah, in an oar-like fashion.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.820
I could watch this all day.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.159
But that's not gonna happen.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.789
Based on what they just saw,

18:54.790 --> 18:57.449
Adam and Jamie will each
build their own versions

18:57.450 --> 18:59.999
of lizard/human hybrid footwear.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.790
The aim is the same... to run on water.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.839
Where the waterproof shoes failed,

19:04.840 --> 19:07.060
these just might do the job.

19:07.450 --> 19:10.169
So, after looking at all the
scientific papers that I've got

19:10.170 --> 19:13.009
about the physics of how this
lizard stays above the water,

19:13.010 --> 19:16.729
it really seems to come down
to the surface area of its foot

19:16.730 --> 19:19.069
and how hard it smacks the water.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.189
The design details of Adam's

19:21.190 --> 19:24.749
water-smacking lizard loafers
are all in his head.

19:24.750 --> 19:28.789
The hinge in his feet shows that
flexibility is a key factor.

19:28.790 --> 19:31.899
But otherwise, it's a
case of watch and wait.

19:31.900 --> 19:35.669
Jamie, however, lays all
his cards on the table.

19:35.670 --> 19:38.180
I figure, why mess around?

19:39.700 --> 19:41.309
It's clear from the get-go

19:41.310 --> 19:44.670
that we're witnessing the
birth of the shovel shoe...

19:45.090 --> 19:46.150
...patent pending.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
Now, a lizard foot

19:47.721 --> 19:49.879
is an incredibly hard thing to replicate.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.929
It's a whole bunch of finely
muscled and jointed segments

19:52.930 --> 19:56.010
all working together, that
allow it to run on water.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.539
So I've taken a kind of
intuitive leap here.

19:59.540 --> 20:02.979
I'm hoping that cupped shape
of the inverted shovel blade

20:02.980 --> 20:05.619
will cut into the water and
then scoop it backwards.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.568
And once it's finished
with the first sweep,

20:07.569 --> 20:10.030
it should be easy enough to
pull the whole thing forwards

20:10.031 --> 20:12.299
without dragging half
the lake back with it.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.008
And just so you don't break your ankles,

20:14.009 --> 20:15.450
the attachments I'm using here

20:15.451 --> 20:17.129
are slightly modified boots

20:17.130 --> 20:19.630
and ankle braces from snowboards.

20:20.190 --> 20:23.899
Meantime, Adam proves he's
the master of multitasking.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.929
If you're not sure what he's up to,

20:25.930 --> 20:27.159
here's a clue.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.880
So, his tail's coming out to about here.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.660
Seems like it's counterbalancing him.

20:32.670 --> 20:35.699
Yeah. Also, potentially,
you know, ruddering...

20:35.700 --> 20:38.269
Yep. In the quest to build a better lizard,

20:38.270 --> 20:40.749
Adam's decided it's not all about the feet.

20:40.750 --> 20:44.209
The basilisk lizard has
substantial counterbalance.

20:44.210 --> 20:48.979
So an articulated tail is
deemed essential equipment.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.820
Yeah, it's a big tail. So what?

20:51.790 --> 20:52.660
Adam's done,

20:52.661 --> 20:56.180
and Jamie's shovel shoes
are also ready for action.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.560
That might work.

21:00.270 --> 21:02.309
So it's back to the very same lake

21:02.310 --> 21:05.649
that proved so unsupportive
the first time around.

21:05.650 --> 21:08.099
But they have changed the stunt staff.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.389
Our water-walking lizard today
will be played by Jessica.

21:11.390 --> 21:13.899
She's 58 1/4 inches tall,
weighs 100 pounds,

21:13.900 --> 21:15.639
and she's an acrobat.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.238
We think that her strength, her agility,

21:17.239 --> 21:18.510
and her diminutive size

21:18.511 --> 21:22.349
make her the perfect candidate
to help us make this work.

21:22.350 --> 21:23.700
- You feeling ready?
- Ready!

21:23.701 --> 21:25.120
Let's do it.

21:25.550 --> 21:28.049
If either design stands a chance,

21:28.050 --> 21:31.009
it makes sense to strap
them to the lightest,

21:31.010 --> 21:33.060
most agile frame they can find.

21:33.330 --> 21:36.029
First up is the control,
our point of comparison

21:36.030 --> 21:37.830
Jessica is going to run into the water

21:37.831 --> 21:41.170
without any apparatus on
her, just like we did.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.899
Jessica's faster than Adam and Jamie.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.100
She's much lighter.

21:45.101 --> 21:48.439
And the odds are she
should do a little better.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.259
Here we go! Running on water!

21:50.260 --> 21:54.380
Control in three, two, one, go!

22:00.990 --> 22:03.320
- She is fast.
- Yep.

22:03.380 --> 22:04.750
Come on out.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.820
Nice work. Let's get you dry.

22:08.580 --> 22:09.870
Checking the high-speed,

22:09.871 --> 22:11.479
it's hard to see any marked

22:11.480 --> 22:13.299
improvement over Adam and Jamie.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.389
She ran, she hit water,

22:15.390 --> 22:17.230
and she sank.

22:18.460 --> 22:19.450
Come on.

22:19.451 --> 22:21.609
But maybe, just maybe,

22:21.610 --> 22:25.049
Adam's giant shoes will reverse the result.

22:25.050 --> 22:26.879
The biggest obstacle to buoyancy

22:26.880 --> 22:29.679
is that Jess is denser than water.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.019
But then again, so is a lizard.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.729
The basilisk spreads scaly
fringes between its toes

22:35.730 --> 22:38.369
to increase its surface area on the water,

22:38.370 --> 22:40.659
which is what Adam's tried to do.

22:40.660 --> 22:44.310
Then it all comes down
to speed and balance.

22:47.060 --> 22:49.199
Now, if it's true that we are minutes away

22:49.200 --> 22:51.040
from setting lizard/human, hybrid history

22:51.041 --> 22:52.899
and walking a human on the water,

22:52.900 --> 22:54.670
it will be because of
my two-pronged attack.

22:54.671 --> 22:56.379
First prong is the feet,

22:56.380 --> 22:58.379
providing the widest possible surface area

22:58.380 --> 23:00.068
for Jessica to smack the water with,

23:00.069 --> 23:01.708
providing, hopefully, enough up pressure

23:01.709 --> 23:03.178
to keep her above the surface,

23:03.179 --> 23:04.960
and giving her the same
amount of flexibility

23:04.961 --> 23:07.859
as her normal feet or as
close as we could achieve.

23:07.860 --> 23:10.329
The second prong is the tail,

23:10.330 --> 23:12.879
acting as both a rudder and a stabilizer.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.720
A lizard wouldn't run across
the water without it,

23:14.721 --> 23:17.129
and neither will our acrobat.

23:17.130 --> 23:18.090
How's she gonna do?

23:18.091 --> 23:20.979
Well, she looks about as
close to a jesus lizard

23:20.980 --> 23:23.009
as you can get at this point.

23:23.010 --> 23:26.350
It worked for the lizard.
Maybe it'll work for her.

23:27.890 --> 23:28.598
Let's do it.

23:28.599 --> 23:29.620
If nothing else,

23:29.621 --> 23:31.509
our acrobat's about to prove

23:31.510 --> 23:33.060
she's no lounge lizard.

23:33.070 --> 23:36.430
In three, two, one, go!

23:37.190 --> 23:38.500
You can do it!

23:38.700 --> 23:40.600
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

23:47.080 --> 23:49.180
How are you doing? You all right?

23:50.130 --> 23:52.849
Astonishingly, it did not work!

23:52.850 --> 23:54.429
It's, like, stuck in the mud!

23:54.430 --> 23:55.290
Oh, really?

23:55.291 --> 23:58.259
Jess did her best, but it's fair to say

23:58.260 --> 24:00.940
the rig fell short of its early promise.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.438
Did you feel like the shoes

24:03.439 --> 24:04.430
held you above the water at all?

24:04.431 --> 24:05.899
- Not at all.
- No?

24:05.900 --> 24:07.720
- You just plunged right in?
- Yep.

24:08.170 --> 24:10.539
Now, it's all up to genius Jamie

24:10.540 --> 24:12.989
to prove that a man... or woman...

24:12.990 --> 24:15.109
can walk on water.

24:15.110 --> 24:17.809
Coming up, the hopefully bombproof shield

24:17.810 --> 24:20.400
that just might defeat its own purpose.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.279
It's right next to that bomb.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.620
It's gonna... boom!... smash that car!

24:30.760 --> 24:33.089
So, so far, testing what is bombproof,

24:33.090 --> 24:35.169
it turns out that the table will save you

24:35.170 --> 24:37.899
from death and injury from the blast wave.

24:37.900 --> 24:41.809
However, at 10 feet, it will not
save you from the shrapnel.

24:41.810 --> 24:43.249
But a wooden table is

24:43.250 --> 24:46.139
a world away from a mostly metal car.

24:46.140 --> 24:50.309
It's another classic Hollywood
refuge suggested by fans.

24:50.310 --> 24:53.569
The silver sedan is set
side onto the blast,

24:53.570 --> 24:55.389
out on the 20-foot ring.

24:55.390 --> 24:56.960
And stop.

24:57.510 --> 25:00.919
So, this is our 13 PSI burst disk

25:00.920 --> 25:02.700
here at the edge of the injury zone,

25:02.701 --> 25:05.109
and it's right here
behind the wheel, where,

25:05.110 --> 25:07.349
you know, if you were
hiding from an explosion,

25:07.350 --> 25:08.580
you'd crouch.

25:08.660 --> 25:10.759
Whether or not that's a smart move,

25:10.760 --> 25:12.660
we'll find out when the bomb goes off.

25:12.661 --> 25:14.829
The white car drew the short straw,

25:14.830 --> 25:16.519
so it's in the death zone.

25:16.520 --> 25:20.850
And the death disk now has
an injury disk for company.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.149
What I've done now is added

25:23.150 --> 25:25.179
an injury disk in the death zone,

25:25.180 --> 25:26.620
'cause what I wanna find out is,

25:26.621 --> 25:28.179
will the blast cause injury

25:28.180 --> 25:30.830
in the death zone now
if the car is in place?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.279
Okay, so, we've got two cars set up,

25:33.280 --> 25:36.389
and 3 pounds of C4 between them.

25:36.390 --> 25:37.890
I think it's gonna be a pretty good shield.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.469
Kari agrees that the car
should block the shock wave.

25:41.470 --> 25:42.820
Check out this man.

25:43.030 --> 25:46.420
But she's still convinced
it'll all end in tears.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.580
If the burst disks rupture,

25:48.581 --> 25:49.989
it's not from the wave.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.868
It's 'cause a car's gonna fall onto them.

25:51.869 --> 25:53.280
It's right next to that bump.

25:53.281 --> 25:54.799
It tore a table in half.

25:54.800 --> 25:58.260
It's gonna... poof!... smash
that car straight into those.

25:58.570 --> 25:59.710
She might be right.

25:59.711 --> 26:02.539
If you're crushed by the shelter
you're cringing behind,

26:02.540 --> 26:04.969
that does kind of defeat the purpose.

26:04.970 --> 26:06.700
Okay.

26:07.580 --> 26:10.980
Here we go! In three, two, one!

26:13.890 --> 26:14.700
You know what?

26:14.701 --> 26:16.799
That looked like a pretty good bomb shield.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.299
Dude, did you see how far it moved the car?

26:19.300 --> 26:21.009
- Yeah!
- I'm not so sure.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.780
- Let's check it out.
- All right.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.179
It's clear that the car nearest the bomb

26:26.180 --> 26:27.509
took a beating.

26:27.510 --> 26:29.449
But just to build the suspense,

26:29.450 --> 26:32.399
they checked the injury-zone disks first.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.049
Oh, my gosh. Look at the
damage it did to that car.

26:35.050 --> 26:38.119
It shattered the window,
knocked the hubcaps off...

26:38.120 --> 26:40.329
Wow. That is intense.

26:40.330 --> 26:43.030
But the disk tells its own story.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.460
They're not burst. We're good.

26:44.461 --> 26:46.539
All right. Looks like we're bombproof

26:46.540 --> 26:48.099
against injury at 20 feet.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.209
- Perfect. Let's check for death.
- Awesome.

26:50.210 --> 26:52.259
So now for the big one.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.129
Behind the death-zone car

26:54.130 --> 26:56.740
was a death disk, and an injury disk.

26:58.690 --> 27:00.449
That is crazy.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.169
There's no way you survive this.

27:02.170 --> 27:04.189
Expectations are not high.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.779
Oh, my God. You survive.

27:06.780 --> 27:08.389
You survive death?

27:08.390 --> 27:08.990
Yeah!

27:08.991 --> 27:10.859
- You don't die?
- No.

27:10.860 --> 27:12.260
- You live?
- You live.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.289
It takes a while to sink in.

27:15.290 --> 27:17.759
Even though the injury disk burst,

27:17.760 --> 27:19.589
the death disk did not.

27:19.590 --> 27:23.269
So by our criteria, then,
car is bombproof.

27:23.270 --> 27:24.738
Looks like there's some truth to

27:24.739 --> 27:25.880
these action films after all.

27:27.130 --> 27:29.029
The high-speed shows

27:29.030 --> 27:30.350
the car buffeted five feet,

27:30.351 --> 27:31.989
which would knock you flat.

27:31.990 --> 27:33.759
Most of the glass shattered,

27:33.760 --> 27:35.529
and the burst injury disk shows

27:35.530 --> 27:38.039
you wouldn't jump up
shouting, "you missed me!",

27:38.040 --> 27:41.999
but given this methodology
and this amount of C4,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.869
a car is a safe shelter.

27:44.870 --> 27:46.409
This was a really cool explosion.

27:46.410 --> 27:48.728
Honestly, I thought the car
would get a lot more torn up,

27:48.729 --> 27:50.590
but it turns out it's a really good block.

27:50.591 --> 27:53.599
We did not burst the instant-death disk.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.170
Now, this is a really interesting result.

27:55.171 --> 27:56.929
We found that a car prevents you

27:56.930 --> 27:58.330
from dying in the death zone

27:58.331 --> 28:00.879
and prevents you from getting
injured in the injury zone,

28:00.880 --> 28:02.650
which means that it's bombproof.

28:08.350 --> 28:10.809
Adam and Jamie are rapidly realizing

28:10.810 --> 28:13.369
that the concept of "man running on water"

28:13.370 --> 28:16.630
is every bit as improbable as it sounds.

28:18.090 --> 28:21.590
Running on top of the water
is totally possible...

28:21.600 --> 28:22.790
...if you're a bug.

28:22.791 --> 28:24.839
Something tiny like a water strider

28:24.840 --> 28:26.489
is small enough and light enough

28:26.490 --> 28:28.949
to rely on the surface tension of the water

28:28.950 --> 28:30.529
to stay on top of it.

28:30.530 --> 28:32.039
As we get larger though,

28:32.040 --> 28:33.719
things like jesus lizards

28:33.720 --> 28:36.469
have to run really hard
to be able to do that.

28:36.470 --> 28:38.319
And as we get larger still,

28:38.320 --> 28:40.879
something like a water fowl, like a duck...

28:40.880 --> 28:42.628
...they can run on top of the water, too,

28:42.629 --> 28:43.830
but they need help.

28:43.831 --> 28:45.539
They use their wings.

28:45.540 --> 28:48.269
Adam built two fancy lizard feet

28:48.270 --> 28:49.959
and a Godzilla tail.

28:49.960 --> 28:54.289
All he managed to do was
to half-drown an acrobat.

28:54.290 --> 28:56.449
But Jamie has dreams of his own,

28:56.450 --> 29:00.069
and Jessica's job is to
make them come true.

29:00.070 --> 29:02.429
So, what do you call these? Shovel shoes?

29:02.430 --> 29:03.989
Shovel shoes they are.

29:03.990 --> 29:07.089
- It kind of has a nice ring to it, don't it?
- Yep.

29:07.090 --> 29:10.329
True to form, Jessica's
soon up and flapping.

29:10.330 --> 29:12.000
How about trying to do a little run?

29:12.001 --> 29:15.249
It seems like she's found her inner lizard.

29:15.250 --> 29:18.239
There you go. It's just
what the jesus lizard does,

29:18.240 --> 29:21.250
whatever... you know,
just... just flail at it.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.930
Now let's go back down to the water.

29:23.931 --> 29:26.409
But any purchase of Jamie's shovel shoes

29:26.410 --> 29:27.789
comes with a free gift,

29:27.790 --> 29:31.389
a kind of outrigger walking
frame that adds balance.

29:31.390 --> 29:34.069
Much like a tail does, but up front.

29:34.070 --> 29:37.199
While a tail may provide a
certain amount of stability,

29:37.200 --> 29:38.860
I figure that we can do the same thing

29:38.861 --> 29:40.349
in the front with a ski.

29:40.350 --> 29:41.989
But with the ski, we'll also get

29:41.990 --> 29:44.780
a certain amount of
supporting lift on the water.

29:45.090 --> 29:47.759
Jamie's also relying on
a bigger surface area

29:47.760 --> 29:49.419
to help keep Jess afloat.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.359
But Adam's shoes were flat.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.939
And these concave feet could
make a real difference.

29:54.940 --> 29:58.429
On the other hand, the ski's
too cumbersome to carry.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.030
So she won't get much of a run-up.

30:01.430 --> 30:02.269
Okay.

30:02.270 --> 30:06.760
Shovel shoes in three, two, one, go.

30:11.790 --> 30:13.729
Okay, that was just embarrassing.

30:13.730 --> 30:17.040
So maybe the ski should
go the way of the tail.

30:18.190 --> 30:21.249
All right, shovel shoes without the sled...

30:21.250 --> 30:24.149
in three, two, one,

30:24.150 --> 30:25.720
go.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.589
She's a good sport.

30:30.590 --> 30:32.319
We could try this a hundred times,

30:32.320 --> 30:35.729
and I don't think we'd
get running on water.

30:35.730 --> 30:37.700
No, I don't think we would.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.969
Straight ahead, the
dumpster and the brick wall

30:41.970 --> 30:45.169
that might or might not save your life.

30:45.170 --> 30:48.170
Hey, somebody threw away a
perfectly a good mythbuster.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.030
So, here's where we're at.

30:55.031 --> 30:57.479
We are testing the myth
of "what is bombproof?"

30:57.480 --> 31:00.279
And so far, we've tested a
wooden table and a car.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.179
And as it turns out, those
things are bombproof,

31:03.180 --> 31:05.699
both in the death zone,
and in the injury zone.

31:05.700 --> 31:09.299
Next up, we're gonna test
one of these... a dumpster.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.799
It's like in the action movies
where a bomb's going off,

31:11.800 --> 31:13.138
hero sees a dumpster, thinks

31:13.139 --> 31:14.840
"oh, I'll jump in there and be safe".

31:14.841 --> 31:16.379
Whatever happens, it looks like

31:16.380 --> 31:18.210
they've already confirmed the myth

31:18.220 --> 31:21.269
that getting in is a whole
lot easier than getting out.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.020
What a shame.

31:22.021 --> 31:24.770
Somebody threw away a
perfectly good mythbuster.

31:25.730 --> 31:27.279
A little help?

31:27.280 --> 31:29.250
As with the table and the car,

31:29.260 --> 31:31.429
they'll test two dumpsters,

31:31.430 --> 31:33.459
one at the 10-foot death zone,

31:33.460 --> 31:35.529
and one at the 20-foot injury zone.

31:35.530 --> 31:36.730
Perfect!

31:37.470 --> 31:39.680
If this doesn't work out,
we could be trash men.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.799
Okay, this is the 13 PSI.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.910
- All right, this is the injury disk.
- Yep.

31:45.540 --> 31:46.540
Once again, they fit

31:46.541 --> 31:48.119
an injury and a death disk

31:48.120 --> 31:50.289
in the death-zone dumpster.

31:50.290 --> 31:52.639
Now, you'd think those four steel walls

31:52.640 --> 31:54.370
would be the best shelter yet

31:54.395 --> 31:57.295
against having a bomb turn
your insides to custard.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.449
But here's the thing...

31:59.450 --> 32:03.999
it's a mostly enclosed
box, except for the lid.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.909
If that energy wave actually
diffracts around the top edge,

32:07.910 --> 32:10.599
because it has these rigid walls inside,

32:10.600 --> 32:12.129
you could see some reflection

32:12.130 --> 32:15.660
and possibly get higher
pressures inside of the box.

32:16.110 --> 32:20.319
And that same, exact thought
has already occurred to Kari.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.730
If the wave happens to bounce

32:21.731 --> 32:23.799
off the back side of the dumpster,

32:23.800 --> 32:27.339
if it amplifies, we might
burst one of the disks.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.229
Oh, bomb's going off! Get in!

32:29.230 --> 32:32.369
But Tory's got no time for
this kind of trash talk.

32:32.370 --> 32:33.128
You know what?

32:33.129 --> 32:35.190
I have a feeling this is gonna
act just like a bunker.

32:35.191 --> 32:37.419
I mean, you're surrounded by steel.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.989
The roof is open, but I think

32:38.990 --> 32:40.989
the shock wave is gonna go right over you.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.679
You might get some ear damage,

32:42.680 --> 32:44.350
but I think you're gonna be pretty good.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.169
And the catalyst for catastrophe

32:47.170 --> 32:51.300
is still 3 whole pounds
of plastic explosive.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.190
Let's do this.

32:53.340 --> 32:56.310
In three, two, one...

32:58.930 --> 33:00.420
Nice.

33:00.780 --> 33:01.550
Well, that looked pretty good,

33:01.551 --> 33:04.350
- those dumpsters look in pretty good shape.
- Yeah. Let's check it out.

33:04.351 --> 33:05.770
The one on the right went boom!

33:07.620 --> 33:10.639
The 13 PSI disk in the injury dumpster

33:10.640 --> 33:12.179
remains intact.

33:12.180 --> 33:14.930
So you'd be unscathed at 20 feet.

33:15.090 --> 33:16.430
And the death-zone dumpster

33:16.431 --> 33:19.529
doesn't look too much the worse for wear.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.518
You know, for being so close to that blast,

33:21.519 --> 33:23.510
this dumpster looks in pretty good shape.

33:23.511 --> 33:26.249
Hey, the 75 PSI disk is not ruptured.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.858
Yeah, but the injury disk is busted.

33:27.859 --> 33:29.760
So you're gonna survive,
but you're injured.

33:29.761 --> 33:32.639
But some of the shock wave
must have penetrated,

33:32.640 --> 33:35.039
or the injury disk wouldn't have burst.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.219
Still, the dumpsters did well.

33:37.220 --> 33:39.259
Injury free at the injury zone,

33:39.260 --> 33:42.629
and alive, but unwell, at the death zone.

33:42.630 --> 33:43.680
So, this is the dumpster

33:43.681 --> 33:46.159
that was 10 feet away from the C4 blast.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.870
And look at it. It's in pretty good shape.

33:47.871 --> 33:50.019
I mean, it's got some concaving happening,

33:50.020 --> 33:51.719
so it took a lot of the shock.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.559
But, I mean, it acted like armor.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.359
And our death disk did not burst,

33:56.360 --> 33:58.169
which means if you were in here,

33:58.170 --> 33:59.238
you would have survived.

33:59.239 --> 34:01.080
You'd probably be bleeding from your ears,

34:01.081 --> 34:02.839
but it is bombproof.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.959
So far, the results have
surprised everyone,

34:05.960 --> 34:07.010
not least because

34:07.011 --> 34:10.239
every shelter tested inside said parameters

34:10.239 --> 34:12.768
actually would save your life.

34:12.770 --> 34:15.649
Next and last is a cinder-block wall.

34:15.650 --> 34:18.259
And if you think you know
how this one goes down,

34:18.260 --> 34:21.500
all I can say is you're probably wrong.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.629
I'm pretty sure that this wall
is going to block the wave

34:24.630 --> 34:26.118
and you're gonna survive behind it,

34:26.119 --> 34:27.900
and you're gonna get no injuries behind it.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.310
I mean, it's a brick freaking wall.

34:30.639 --> 34:31.590
Point taken.

34:31.591 --> 34:34.539
And they've only built
one brick freaking wall,

34:34.540 --> 34:36.609
as Tory explains.

34:36.610 --> 34:38.217
So, we only have one wall to test this one,

34:38.219 --> 34:39.760
but we still have to have the death zone,

34:39.761 --> 34:41.129
which is 10 feet away,

34:41.130 --> 34:43.349
and the injury zone, which is 20 feet away.

34:43.350 --> 34:44.730
So, since we only have one wall,

34:44.731 --> 34:46.929
we're gonna have to move our blast zone

34:46.929 --> 34:49.070
to 10 feet and 20 feet.

34:49.580 --> 34:53.168
Common sense says start
wide and work your way in.

34:53.170 --> 34:56.549
So Tory sets the first
charge at the 20-foot mark.

34:56.550 --> 35:00.039
Grant fits the 13 PSI injury disk,

35:00.040 --> 35:03.819
and Kari supplies the styrofoam stuntman.

35:03.820 --> 35:07.029
Now to see if a freestanding
cinder-block wall

35:07.030 --> 35:09.709
is as solid and as safe as it looks.

35:09.710 --> 35:13.920
In three, two, one, fire!

35:15.550 --> 35:17.489
Oh, I never get tired of that!

35:17.490 --> 35:18.489
That was loud.

35:18.490 --> 35:20.389
All right! That was a big blast.

35:20.390 --> 35:22.340
All right, let's see if it was bombproof.

35:25.130 --> 35:26.839
The wall's still intact!

35:26.840 --> 35:28.280
It is.

35:28.730 --> 35:29.969
And the disk?

35:29.970 --> 35:31.579
The disk is...

35:31.580 --> 35:33.479
crinkled, but still intact.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.760
So it's bombproof for injury.

35:34.761 --> 35:37.310
All right, let's see if
it'll save your life.

35:41.820 --> 35:44.839
They're down to the last
3 pounds of explosive.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.139
And halving the distance from last time

35:47.140 --> 35:49.829
brings it all into perilous perspective.

35:49.830 --> 35:51.749
All right, 10 feet is right here.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.389
Oh, my God, that's so close.

35:53.390 --> 35:55.959
Oh, my gosh. We're gonna destroy this wall.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.130
All right, bang it in.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.269
The wall itself was
examined and patched up,

36:01.270 --> 36:03.410
so it's just as strong as before.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.000
You're very trusting right now.

36:05.001 --> 36:06.529
No longer.

36:06.530 --> 36:09.269
Grant installs the last two burst disks...

36:09.270 --> 36:11.060
All right, 75...

36:12.600 --> 36:14.780
...and 13.

36:15.310 --> 36:17.509
...and the bunker beckons.

36:17.510 --> 36:21.350
In three, two, one, firing!

36:24.020 --> 36:26.899
- My gosh!
- Down went the wall!

36:26.900 --> 36:29.659
- So...
- That wall is gone!

36:29.660 --> 36:32.179
I don't know if the disk is ruptured,

36:32.180 --> 36:34.569
but I think a brick would
fall on your head.

36:34.570 --> 36:35.760
I think we have shrapnel.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.999
I don't think that's bombproof at all.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.430
Let's go check it out!

36:40.540 --> 36:42.349
It sure doesn't look good.

36:42.350 --> 36:45.829
Barely a single brick is
still joined to another,

36:45.830 --> 36:47.339
but the bombproof proof

36:47.340 --> 36:50.049
all rests with those sensitive disks.

36:50.050 --> 36:52.179
We're testing the lethality
of the shock wave,

36:52.180 --> 36:54.320
pure and simple.

36:56.150 --> 36:57.150
They both survived.

36:57.151 --> 36:59.259
So, both disks are still intact.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.120
All right, so it looks like

37:00.121 --> 37:02.239
the wall protects you from the shock wave,

37:02.240 --> 37:04.309
both from injury, and death.

37:04.310 --> 37:06.009
It's an amazing result.

37:06.010 --> 37:08.919
The blast was big enough to
turn the wall to rubble,

37:08.920 --> 37:11.000
but the wall would still save you from

37:11.390 --> 37:13.269
death, and even injury.

37:13.270 --> 37:15.359
Incredibly, all four shelters

37:15.360 --> 37:18.009
made an otherwise fatal blast survivable,

37:18.010 --> 37:20.309
which is a massively surprising result.

37:20.310 --> 37:21.940
And the foam figures showed that

37:21.950 --> 37:26.090
serious shrapnel was only a
factor with the wooden table.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.489
I wonder what else is bombproof.

37:28.490 --> 37:31.079
- What about duct tape?
- Uh, that's a good one.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.269
- Phone books?
- Um, I like that one.

37:33.270 --> 37:35.549
All right, well, as incredible as it seems,

37:35.550 --> 37:37.759
I think we're gonna have
to call "myth confirmed"

37:37.760 --> 37:39.159
on all four shelters.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.459
I mean, they were technically bombproof

37:41.460 --> 37:43.069
in the parameters that we set up.

37:43.070 --> 37:44.520
Yeah, but we should make it clear

37:44.521 --> 37:46.109
that if the blast were any larger

37:46.110 --> 37:47.609
or the explosion any closer,

37:47.610 --> 37:49.308
that'd be a different situation.

37:49.309 --> 37:51.298
Yeah, we were specifically
testing the blast wave,

37:51.299 --> 37:52.640
and if you dive behind something solid,

37:52.641 --> 37:54.359
it's definitely gonna dampen it.

37:54.360 --> 37:57.280
But shrapnel? Now, that's unpredictable.

38:01.230 --> 38:02.449
Still to come,

38:02.450 --> 38:05.729
Adam and Jamie finally do walk on water.

38:05.730 --> 38:07.390
- Go!
- All right, let's go.

38:15.370 --> 38:17.049
We've tried everything we can

38:17.050 --> 38:18.739
to successfully run on the water.

38:18.740 --> 38:20.650
We've tried it ourselves,...

38:22.440 --> 38:25.180
...we brought in an
olympic-class runner,...

38:27.110 --> 38:29.749
...and we even made a human/lizard hybrid

38:29.750 --> 38:32.449
by strapping two special
sets of shoes to a gymnast,...

38:32.450 --> 38:33.550
Yes! Yes! Oh!

38:34.550 --> 38:36.950
...and nothing has worked.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.659
I think you'll agree that
this thing is busted.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.570
But of course, we can't leave it there.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.109
We want to see us run on water,

38:44.110 --> 38:46.469
which means we've got to cheat this sucker.

38:46.470 --> 38:47.560
And I think you know, on "MythBusters",

38:47.570 --> 38:48.908
when we're about to cheat something,

38:48.909 --> 38:50.208
that means we're gonna utilize

38:50.209 --> 38:52.190
a pile of wood and a pile of steel.

38:52.191 --> 38:53.669
Let the cheating begin.

38:53.670 --> 38:55.769
What we have in mind is a bridge.

38:55.770 --> 38:57.710
But instead of going over the water,

38:57.711 --> 38:59.709
our bridge will go under the water,

38:59.710 --> 39:01.619
maybe a couple of inches or so.

39:01.620 --> 39:02.910
You won't be able to see it,

39:02.911 --> 39:06.459
but we'll be able to run on it,
just like they did in the clip.

39:06.460 --> 39:08.999
But building a sub-aqua sidewalk

39:09.000 --> 39:11.599
is a whole lot trickier than it sounds.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.620
We're using square tube steel for the frame

39:13.630 --> 39:16.269
because it's relatively
easy to cut and weld.

39:16.270 --> 39:19.189
Obviously, also, it's
less buoyant than wood.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.089
And that means that we won't have to

39:21.090 --> 39:23.369
weight it down as much to keep it stable.

39:23.370 --> 39:25.999
But they do need a wood surface to run on.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.539
It's got enough give

39:27.540 --> 39:29.949
to enhance the illusion
of running on water.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.119
Awesome.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.500
The next step is to camouflage it black.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.529
Look at that.

39:36.530 --> 39:39.219
White shirt, black paint...

39:39.220 --> 39:42.660
that's what being fearless is all about.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.000
What?

39:47.550 --> 39:50.839
The black paint should reflect
the least amount of light.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.349
And it's all tied together

39:52.350 --> 39:55.410
with a long strip of
flexible, clear plastic.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.329
This is the device

39:57.330 --> 39:58.738
that will allow us to look like

39:58.739 --> 39:59.940
we're running on the water.

39:59.941 --> 40:01.659
It's an underwater bridge.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.948
It has two features

40:02.949 --> 40:04.558
that'll make this
extra-realistic, I believe.

40:04.559 --> 40:07.028
One... a set of adjustments.
Now, it's all the way down,

40:07.029 --> 40:08.968
that'll allow us to precisely calibrate

40:08.969 --> 40:10.430
its distance under the water.

40:10.431 --> 40:13.259
I believe it's about 1.5 to
2 inches, will be ideal.

40:13.260 --> 40:16.859
And two, this wooden top actually floats,

40:16.860 --> 40:18.559
which means when we run along it,

40:18.560 --> 40:20.360
it's actually gonna give a little bit,

40:20.361 --> 40:22.519
hopefully lending an extra-realistic

40:22.520 --> 40:23.770
aspect to our running.

40:24.090 --> 40:25.929
All that remains is to sink it

40:25.930 --> 40:28.179
precisely to 2 inches under.

40:28.180 --> 40:30.099
And that calls for teamwork.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.469
- It's beautifully balanced!
- Oh, good!

40:32.470 --> 40:34.169
Let's walk on down.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.280
Okay.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.169
The basic concept of a sunken catwalk

40:38.170 --> 40:40.010
is pretty straightforward.

40:40.090 --> 40:41.449
Does that seem right?

40:41.450 --> 40:43.398
I think that seems right. It looks great.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.650
Let's lower it down.

40:45.070 --> 40:47.369
But the uneven contours of the lake bed

40:47.370 --> 40:49.590
force Adam to make some adjustments.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.609
After a delicate tap or two,

40:52.610 --> 40:55.019
both Adam and Jamie are convinced

40:55.020 --> 40:56.290
that they're good to go.

40:56.291 --> 40:57.629
I know! I know!

40:57.630 --> 41:00.169
You're thinking, "I can
totally see that bridge!"

41:00.170 --> 41:01.819
"How is this thing gonna work?"

41:01.820 --> 41:04.719
Remember, special effects isn't
only about building a prop,

41:04.720 --> 41:07.279
it's also about how you film the prop.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.300
We're not gonna film
this from this angle...

41:10.220 --> 41:12.339
we're gonna film it from this angle!

41:12.340 --> 41:14.089
See? No bridge.

41:14.090 --> 41:15.789
Do you see a bridge?!

41:15.790 --> 41:16.929
No bridge!

41:16.930 --> 41:18.249
No bridge.

41:18.250 --> 41:21.350
Now let's see if our fake
measures up to theirs.

41:22.190 --> 41:24.519
Running on water by cheating

41:24.520 --> 41:29.169
in three, two, one, go!

41:29.170 --> 41:30.410
All right, let's go.

41:35.070 --> 41:37.120
Yeah! That looked great!

41:38.920 --> 41:40.490
Beautiful!

41:41.520 --> 41:44.790
And that, ladies and
gentlemen, is how it's done.

41:45.310 --> 41:49.209
Ours was a fraud, and it
looks like theirs was, too.

41:49.210 --> 41:50.249
My turn.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.399
But Jamie knows better than anyone

41:52.400 --> 41:56.079
that reliable results should be repeatable.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.500
Three, two, one, go!

41:59.560 --> 42:01.429
Go! Go! Go! You've got it!

42:01.430 --> 42:03.560
You've got it! Yes! Yes!

42:05.030 --> 42:06.130
Beautiful!

42:06.750 --> 42:09.050
And repeatedly repeatable.

42:16.760 --> 42:21.869
Not to mention reproduced,
replicated, and duplicated,

42:21.870 --> 42:23.110
just to be on the safe side.

42:23.111 --> 42:24.780
That was very light-footed!

42:26.820 --> 42:28.310
- That worked pretty well!
- Yeah!

42:29.980 --> 42:33.119
In fact, it matched
the viral video so well,

42:33.120 --> 42:37.290
that the only way to call
this myth is "busted".

42:39.570 --> 42:40.460
Well, I think the take-home
from this is that

42:40.470 --> 42:42.630
when you need a little magic
to make something work,

42:42.631 --> 42:44.279
movie magic will suffice.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.000
And don't believe everything you see.

42:46.001 --> 42:47.970
- Exactly.
- After you.
