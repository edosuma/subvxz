00:45.839 --> 00:47.549
<i>Make way on the bridge!</i>

00:47.841 --> 00:50.093
<i>Battle arms, engage!</i>

01:01.146 --> 01:03.273
<i>It is a truth universally acknowledged</i>

01:03.356 --> 01:07.152
<i>that a zombie in possession of brains
must be in want of more brains.</i>

01:09.112 --> 01:10.739
<i>Never was this truth more plain</i>

01:10.822 --> 01:13.658
<i>than in the recent
attacks at Netherfield Park,</i>

01:13.742 --> 01:16.453
<i>in which an entire household
was slaughtered</i>

01:16.619 --> 01:19.664
<i>by a horde of the living dead
during a whist party.</i>

01:26.713 --> 01:28.131
Who goes there?

01:30.884 --> 01:32.218
Who goes there?

01:33.344 --> 01:34.596
Darcy.

01:35.555 --> 01:37.015
Colonel Darcy.

02:08.378 --> 02:12.550
No zombie bite marks
on this pristine, young body.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.189
Father.

02:28.441 --> 02:32.904
How were you able to discern
that the wound on my rib was from fencing?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.781
Been at this a long time, my son.

02:36.074 --> 02:37.116
I have no wound.

02:44.624 --> 02:46.543
Lovely bid, Mr. Kingston!

02:46.626 --> 02:48.753
More sherry for Mr. Kingston please!

02:50.171 --> 02:51.798
Mrs. Featherstone.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.175
I'm afraid Mr. Darcy's here
to see you, ma'am.

02:54.259 --> 02:55.385
Darcy?

02:57.512 --> 02:58.555
Carry on.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.265
We have absolutely nothing to hide.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.101
Please, everyone. Enjoy.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.025
Mr. Darcy.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.280
Colonel Darcy, Mrs. Featherstone.
I'm here on official business.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.078
There's been a report that
somebody here has been bitten.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.371
Surely not.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.541
There hasn't been a zombie incident
in Hertfordshire for over two years.

03:31.129 --> 03:33.047
I assure you, we've taken every precaution.

03:33.131 --> 03:36.384
A newly-infected zombie is
almost impossible to detect.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.887
Until they've ingested
their first human brains,

03:38.970 --> 03:42.557
at which point, the transformation
accelerates with every subsequent kill.

03:42.807 --> 03:45.935
Yes. We are all well aware
of how it works, Colonel Darcy.

03:49.814 --> 03:52.483
Well, are you quite satisfied?

03:54.903 --> 03:55.987
Quite.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.448
- Might I play a hand?
- Of course.

04:01.910 --> 04:02.952
Good evening.

04:03.369 --> 04:04.579
So, shall we?

04:11.336 --> 04:12.462
A potion?

04:12.545 --> 04:13.546
Flies, ma'am.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.173
I beg your pardon?

04:16.007 --> 04:17.132
Carrion flies.

04:17.966 --> 04:22.805
They are in possession of but
one truly enviable talent.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.101
The ability to detect dead flesh.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.187
Well, I've won the trick.

04:29.854 --> 04:32.357
Very crafty play, Mr. Kingston.

04:32.690 --> 04:36.736
I dare say,
the buzzing is frightfully loud.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.656
It's not the buzzing
that should concern you, madam.

04:39.948 --> 04:41.950
But rather, when the buzzing stops.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.711
Oh, dear.

05:15.858 --> 05:16.901
<i>One-nil, Darcy.</i>

05:18.528 --> 05:20.113
I'm going to be faint.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.911
Is there anyone else present

05:27.578 --> 05:29.872
whom he would have had
the opportunity to infect?

05:31.332 --> 05:32.875
A family member, perhaps?

05:42.427 --> 05:44.220
- Good evening.
- Who would dare just leave a zombie head

05:44.303 --> 05:45.388
in the middle of the floor?

05:47.682 --> 05:49.183
It's his head!

05:49.267 --> 05:51.519
Get it away from me.

05:53.271 --> 05:54.897
But Mr. Kingston's niece is here.

05:54.981 --> 05:57.775
There was no need to put that girl
through Mr. Darcy's interrogation!

05:58.735 --> 06:00.111
Cassandra, come back!

06:04.407 --> 06:05.408
Annabelle?

06:06.242 --> 06:07.452
Where are you?

06:20.006 --> 06:21.090
Annabelle?

06:38.316 --> 06:40.985
<i>It wasn't always like this,
my dear daughters.</i>

06:45.239 --> 06:46.908
<i>As the century began,</i>

06:47.408 --> 06:51.496
<i>Britannia was rich
with the fruits of worldwide trade.</i>

06:52.413 --> 06:56.000
<i>From the colonies there came
not just silks and spices,</i>

06:56.084 --> 06:58.836
<i>but a virulent and abominable plague.</i>

06:59.337 --> 07:02.131
<i>Naturally, many suspected
the French were to blame.</i>

07:02.215 --> 07:03.299
<i>Definitely the French.</i>

07:03.382 --> 07:05.343
<i>- Are you surprised?
- No.</i>

07:05.885 --> 07:11.766
<i>Once bitten, the newly-infected were filled
with an insatiable hunger</i>

07:11.933 --> 07:13.810
<i>for the brains of the living.</i>

07:14.727 --> 07:16.187
<i>Millions perished,</i>

07:16.646 --> 07:21.359
<i>only to rise again
as legions of implacable undead.</i>

07:22.401 --> 07:25.863
<i>So certain did it seem
the end of days had come</i>

07:25.947 --> 07:28.783
<i>that even the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i>

07:28.866 --> 07:31.202
<i>are said to have ascended from Hell.</i>

07:32.036 --> 07:35.832
<i>To protect the living,
the Grand Barrier was built,</i>

07:36.124 --> 07:39.210
<i>a 100-foot wall encircling London.</i>

07:39.836 --> 07:43.881
<i>Then excavation began on the Royal Canal,</i>

07:43.965 --> 07:46.968
<i>a vast moat 30 fathoms deep</i>

07:47.051 --> 07:50.263
<i>surrounding both the city and its walls.</i>

07:51.055 --> 07:53.599
<i>The land twixt the two fortifications</i>

07:53.850 --> 07:57.687
<i>- became known as The In-Between.
- The In-Between.</i>

07:57.770 --> 08:03.484
<i>At this time, it became fashionable
to study the deadly arts of the Orient.</i>

08:03.568 --> 08:05.403
<i>Japan for the wealthy.</i>

08:06.070 --> 08:08.197
<i>China for the wise.</i>

08:08.573 --> 08:09.991
<i>In the Second Battle of Kent,</i>

08:10.533 --> 08:14.662
<i>one of the bridges
across the Royal Canal was breached.</i>

08:14.745 --> 08:19.625
<i>Ravenous zombie hordes massacred
every villager of The In-Between.</i>

08:20.084 --> 08:24.797
<i>It was said, the sight of this slaughter
drove young King George mad.</i>

08:25.423 --> 08:30.178
<i>When the battle was finally won, he ordered
the destruction of all the bridges, save one.</i>

08:31.971 --> 08:33.472
<i>Hingham Bridge,</i>

08:33.556 --> 08:38.019
<i>which to this day, remains the only means
by which to cross the Royal Canal.</i>

08:38.102 --> 08:39.395
<i>There's Lady Catherine.</i>

08:39.477 --> 08:42.857
<i>Many believed
the enemy was finally vanquished.</i>

08:42.940 --> 08:47.278
<i>The gentry began to leave
the safe confines of London's defenses</i>

08:47.361 --> 08:50.198
<i>for their newly-fortified country estates.</i>

08:50.489 --> 08:53.242
<i>But vigilance is still of the essence.</i>

08:54.118 --> 08:58.080
<i>Remember this,
keep your swords as sharp as your wit.</i>

08:58.164 --> 09:01.959
<i>For the ultimate battle
between the living and the undead</i>

09:02.627 --> 09:05.171
<i>has yet to be staged.</i>

09:38.412 --> 09:39.413
Mr. Bennet!

09:40.206 --> 09:41.499
Mr. Bennet!

09:46.087 --> 09:50.383
Mr. Bennet, have you heard
that Netherfield Park is occupied again?

09:51.175 --> 09:52.885
By a Mr. Bingley.

09:53.386 --> 09:57.098
A young, single man of large fortune.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.462
Mrs. Long says his income
is four or five thousand a year.

09:59.976 --> 10:03.437
He is attending the village dance tonight.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.982
How does this concern
our warrior daughters?

10:06.524 --> 10:07.817
Oh, how can you be so tiresome?

10:08.109 --> 10:09.869
You know I mean for him
to marry one of them.

10:10.194 --> 10:14.573
Daughters do not dance well
with masticated brains, Mrs. Bennet.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.410
You, sir, have already put them at
a decided social disadvantage

10:17.493 --> 10:20.162
by insisting they do their combat
training in China as opposed to Japan!

10:20.246 --> 10:21.831
The Chinese deadly arts have no equal.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.125
I, for one, would trade nothing
for my Shaolin training.

10:25.376 --> 10:27.420
You mustn't speak like that, Lizzy.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.005
I should like to go to the dance.

10:29.088 --> 10:30.631
Do you think Mr. Bingley's handsome?

10:30.715 --> 10:31.799
With his income, Lydia,

10:31.882 --> 10:34.218
you'd think him handsome
if he had half a zombie face.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.851
- Sorry.
- You'll make me very, very happy.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.437
Well I suppose, if we all go...

10:45.062 --> 10:49.400
No! I don't care to be paraded
like a herd of heifers at a farm auction.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.736
That's because you're the cow
who's least proficient

10:51.819 --> 10:54.196
in the art of tempting the other sex.

10:57.575 --> 10:58.576
Moo.

11:01.037 --> 11:05.166
Do not mistake my indulgence
for a relaxation in discipline!

11:05.374 --> 11:07.585
They must find husbands, Mr. Bennet.

11:07.918 --> 11:11.088
For as you know too well,
they shall inherit nothing when you pass.

11:11.213 --> 11:14.091
Their immediate survival
is my present concern.

11:14.425 --> 11:15.593
Pish.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.183
Well, I'd say you're easily
five times as beautiful

12:04.266 --> 12:05.768
as any other woman in this room.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.019
Stop it, Liz.

12:07.103 --> 12:08.187
It's true.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.231
These girls don't stand a chance.

12:10.648 --> 12:13.818
They say Mr. Bingley brought
a tribe of London dandies with him.

12:17.238 --> 12:19.281
- Smile, Liz.
- I will later.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.833
There's the handsome new master
of Netherfield.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.167
Where?

12:30.835 --> 12:34.255
It was my understanding
that Captain Bingley was in want of a wife.

12:34.338 --> 12:38.926
Oh, he is. Those are his sisters,
Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst.

12:39.009 --> 12:42.555
They say he inherited nearly Â£100,000.

12:48.978 --> 12:51.272
What a magnificent husband he'd make.

12:51.564 --> 12:53.649
Charlotte Lucas,
do you think of nothing else?

12:53.941 --> 12:57.153
Zombies or no zombies,
all women must think of marriage, Lizzy.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.947
I shall never relinquish
my sword for a ring.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.073
For the right man, you would.

13:01.157 --> 13:02.950
The right man wouldn't ask me to.

13:06.787 --> 13:10.124
Mr. Darcy. Rather an imposing presence.

13:10.207 --> 13:14.253
Owns half of Derbyshire.
Â£10,000 a year, at least.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.337
What?

13:15.421 --> 13:17.173
Back to your own family,
Charlotte Lucas.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.632
Now, Liz, you look very nice.

13:18.716 --> 13:20.301
- Well, thank you.
- Don't act so surprised.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.636
Out, out. Out. Smile.

13:29.727 --> 13:30.936
Welcome, dear friend.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.147
- How are you?
- How are you, Charles?

13:33.230 --> 13:35.024
I'm very well.
How was the journey from Derbyshire?

13:35.107 --> 13:36.400
- Fine.
- Good.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.570
So this is Meryton?

13:50.247 --> 13:52.750
She's the most beautiful creature
I ever beheld.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.085
She smiles too much.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.922
She... She's an angel.

13:58.464 --> 13:59.548
Oh, my word.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.642
Charles Bingley,
pleased to make your acquaintance.

14:10.643 --> 14:13.896
Mrs. Bennet.
We've heard so much about you, Mr. Bingley.

14:14.772 --> 14:17.274
My daughters, all of impeccable character.

14:20.110 --> 14:24.198
Well... May I introduce my friend,
Mr. Darcy of Derbyshire!

14:28.911 --> 14:30.663
Are you enjoying Hertfordshire,
Mr. Bingley?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.331
Very much.

14:32.623 --> 14:34.959
I've heard the library at Netherfield
is one of the finest.

14:35.084 --> 14:37.962
Library? Is it?

14:39.547 --> 14:43.467
Miss Bennet, may I be so bold
as to request the next two dances?

14:43.551 --> 14:45.761
If you are not otherwise engaged.

14:46.637 --> 14:47.805
I am not engaged.

14:50.599 --> 14:53.727
Good for you, Mr. Bingley.
You chose the loveliest of my daughters.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.354
- Mother!
- Well...

14:57.022 --> 15:00.901
I consider dancing to be the first
refinement of polished society.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.278
Don't you agree, Mr. Darcy?

15:02.486 --> 15:03.988
No. Every savage can dance.

15:04.572 --> 15:07.172
Why, I imagine even zombies could do it
to some degree of success.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.953
Good evening.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.584
You know, I love to read, too, actually.

15:17.459 --> 15:18.877
I have read.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.563
Please don't forget our next dance,
Miss Bennet.

15:42.151 --> 15:45.946
Darcy, I hate to see you just standing there.
You must dance.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.699
Oh, you know I detest it
when I'm not acquainted with my partner.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.826
- Oh, well...
- Darcy.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.246
You are dancing
with the only handsome girl here.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.624
Oh, but one of her sisters
is also very pretty.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.627
Dare I say, very agreeable.

16:06.425 --> 16:08.719
- Well, she's tolerable but...
- Tolerable?

16:08.927 --> 16:10.512
Yes, tolerable.

16:10.763 --> 16:12.806
But not handsome enough to tempt me.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.767
Nor any other man here, apparently.

16:15.643 --> 16:18.395
Darcy, your standards, my dear fellow...

16:21.231 --> 16:22.441
Oh, that is unfortunate.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.942
What a lack of grace.

16:37.331 --> 16:41.460
Mr. Darcy, you're an insufferable prig.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.504
Fitzwilliam Darcy?

16:44.296 --> 16:45.881
I quite detest the man.

16:46.757 --> 16:50.094
So high and so conceited
that I can't endure him.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.303
Indeed.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.597
I wouldn't dance with him if he were...

16:56.058 --> 16:59.103
Mrs. Featherstone?

17:10.614 --> 17:11.865
You're undead.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.828
I've come to tell you...

17:23.292 --> 17:24.627
What happened, Lizzy?

17:25.963 --> 17:27.423
I narrowly saved her life.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.216
From Mrs. Featherstone?

17:29.299 --> 17:31.093
From an undead Mrs. Featherstone.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.388
I found her to be exceedingly tolerable.

17:35.347 --> 17:38.058
Well done, Darcy. Very heroic.

17:38.142 --> 17:39.582
She was trying to tell me something.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.270
A recipe, perhaps?

17:43.021 --> 17:44.440
Laugh as much as you choose.

17:44.857 --> 17:46.817
But you shall not
laugh me out of my opinion.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.111
She posed no threat.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.076
We are under attack!

17:57.745 --> 17:58.746
Ladies!

18:54.968 --> 18:58.305
Her face is rendered uncommonly intelligent

18:58.388 --> 19:00.516
by the beautiful expression
of her dark eyes.

19:01.391 --> 19:05.145
And I'm forced to acknowledge her
figure as both light and pleasing.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.148
And that her arms are
surprisingly muscular,

19:08.232 --> 19:10.150
yet not so much as to be unfeminine.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.242
Lizzy, I never saw such happy manners.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.744
So much ease with such good breeding.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.079
I give you leave to like him.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.498
You've liked many a stupider person.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.084
He's just what a young man ought to be.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.920
Good-humored, lively, handsome, and...

19:30.003 --> 19:33.924
Quite rich, which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.926
Not as rich as Darcy.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.182
<i>I saw how you looked at him
when he first walked in the dance...</i>

19:42.266 --> 19:43.642
As if I hated him?

19:43.725 --> 19:44.768
As if you liked him.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.770
Until his manners gave me disgust!

19:47.020 --> 19:49.731
He acted as if he were above
our company and above being pleased.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.108
Admit you find him handsome.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.277
Handsome is as handsome does.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.071
Mr. Darcy is therefore a
very ill-looking man.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.617
Girls, you will knock the house down!

20:00.909 --> 20:05.080
Never have I encountered a man
so consumed by his own pride!

20:05.497 --> 20:08.333
One cannot wonder that
so very fine a young man

20:08.417 --> 20:10.794
with family, fortune,
and everything in his favor

20:10.878 --> 20:12.671
should think highly of himself.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.384
If I may so express it,

20:19.136 --> 20:20.846
he has a right to be proud.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.642
I could easily forgive his pride,

20:26.268 --> 20:28.270
if he had not mortified mine.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.315
Pride is a very common failing, I believe.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.609
Vanity and pride are different things,

20:33.692 --> 20:35.986
though the words are
often used synonymously.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.363
A person may be proud without being vain.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.909
Pride relates more
to our opinion of ourselves,

20:41.992 --> 20:44.453
and vanity to what we would
have others think of us.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.544
A letter for Miss Jane Bennet.

20:52.753 --> 20:54.212
He saved you from a zombie.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.715
Mrs. Featherstone was quite civilized.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.387
- Yield!
- Never!

21:05.641 --> 21:08.268
She was a zombie, Lizzy.
Thank goodness he was there.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.402
Lizzy!

21:17.486 --> 21:18.737
No, Lizzy!

21:22.950 --> 21:26.286
- No, no, no! Stop it, Lizzy! That's not fair!
- Lydia!

21:27.704 --> 21:29.665
The Bingleys have invited me to tea.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.167
- Lydia, come on.
- Well, of course they have.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.002
Yeah. Down there.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.380
What?

21:37.089 --> 21:38.799
Truly, I'd much rather go by coach.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.634
You had much better go on horseback,

21:40.717 --> 21:44.054
for it seems likely to rain,
and then you must stay all night.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.473
That would be a good scheme

21:46.556 --> 21:48.517
if you were sure
they would not send her home.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.404
Mother, I really would prefer the carriage.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.813
Jane, Mr. Bingley undoubtedly likes you.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.189
But in nine cases out of 10,

21:54.272 --> 21:56.553
a woman had far better show
more affection than she feels.

21:56.692 --> 21:57.734
Enough.

21:58.860 --> 22:02.072
Go quickly now. The zombies
spring easily from the wet earth.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.883
Merciful God.

23:45.175 --> 23:46.468
This cannot be.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.621
Where is she?

24:14.955 --> 24:17.249
She must be closely monitored
and her room locked at all times...

24:17.332 --> 24:18.500
That is a little excessive, Darcy.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.210
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

24:24.381 --> 24:26.716
Did you walk all the way here?

24:27.092 --> 24:29.719
Yes. How is my sister?

24:29.803 --> 24:32.389
She was feverish and slept ill last night.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.890
I fear she has the flu.

24:34.641 --> 24:35.642
Or worse.

24:35.725 --> 24:39.521
I detest illness. It keeps one
in a continual state of inelegance.

24:39.896 --> 24:40.981
Quite.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.024
May I tend to her?

24:43.108 --> 24:45.068
Of course. Edwin, show Miss Bennet the way.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.737
Thank you.

24:49.656 --> 24:52.976
I will not make the same mistake I made at
Mrs. Featherstone's whist party, Bingley.

25:00.167 --> 25:01.585
Oh, Janey.

25:04.921 --> 25:05.964
Miss Bennet.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.426
The physician has arrived.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.095
Please.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.314
She got caught in the downpour?

25:23.106 --> 25:24.149
Yes.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.968
The wound, Doctor.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.803
Her musket backfired.

26:02.312 --> 26:03.980
I see no indication of a bite.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.399
That was never in question.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.872
I believe that these belong to you.

26:35.345 --> 26:38.139
Darcy, old bean,
you almost seem disappointed.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.400
Louisa, you shouldn't have
played that spade.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.185
I won! I won!

26:44.396 --> 26:45.480
How is she?

26:46.189 --> 26:47.190
She's fast asleep.

26:47.274 --> 26:51.111
I'm sure she'll be quite well.
Please join us, Miss Bennet.

26:51.319 --> 26:53.405
Thank you,
but I'll amuse myself with a book.

26:53.530 --> 26:55.115
You prefer reading to cards?

26:55.615 --> 26:57.909
I prefer a great many things
to cards, Mr. Hurst.

26:58.034 --> 27:03.915
One half of the world cannot understand
the pleasures of the other.

27:06.418 --> 27:07.460
I don't speak Japanese.

27:07.544 --> 27:10.213
No, of course. You didn't train in Japan.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.090
China, was it?

27:12.549 --> 27:14.718
The Shaolin Temple in Henan Province.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.346
It was there that I learned to endure
all manner of discomfort.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.391
May I inquire as to the nature
of this discomfort?

27:21.725 --> 27:23.977
I would much rather
give you a demonstration.

27:29.149 --> 27:32.527
Mr. Darcy, is your sister much grown
since the spring?

27:33.320 --> 27:35.697
She is now about the same height
as Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

27:35.864 --> 27:39.326
I don't believe I've ever met a girl
who was so extremely accomplished.

27:39.409 --> 27:43.496
The word "accomplished" is far too
liberally applied to young ladies today,

27:43.621 --> 27:46.624
but my sister Georgiana
does deserve that distinction.

27:47.792 --> 27:52.172
Not only is she a master of the female arts
but the deadly as well.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.299
I cannot boast of knowing
more than half a dozen

27:54.382 --> 27:56.926
in the whole range of my acquaintance
that is thus accomplished.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.345
Nor I, I'm sure.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.180
Then, Mr. Darcy,

28:00.722 --> 28:03.850
you must comprehend a great deal
in your idea of an accomplished woman.

28:04.392 --> 28:05.393
I do.

28:05.727 --> 28:09.230
A woman must have
a thorough knowledge of music, singing,

28:09.314 --> 28:12.275
drawing, dancing
and the modern languages.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.779
She must be well-trained in the
fighting styles of the Kyoto masters,

28:15.862 --> 28:18.198
and the weapons and tactics
of modern Europe.

28:18.615 --> 28:21.201
Or the term would only be half-deserved.

28:21.326 --> 28:23.787
And you know six such women?

28:24.245 --> 28:25.789
I wonder now at your knowing any.

28:26.122 --> 28:28.083
Are you so severe on your own sex?

28:28.291 --> 28:30.627
A woman is either
highly trained or highly refined.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.130
One cannot afford
the luxury of both in such times.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.554
<i>L'Art de la guerre.</i>

28:42.639 --> 28:43.807
<i>The Art of War.</i>

28:46.267 --> 28:48.395
Have you not read it
in its original Wu dialect?

28:52.315 --> 28:53.483
Alas.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.985
Then you've never read The Art of War.

29:03.535 --> 29:04.702
I should get back to Jane.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.257
She is one of those young ladies

29:17.340 --> 29:19.217
who seeks to recommend themselves to men

29:19.300 --> 29:21.302
by undervaluing their own sex.

29:23.513 --> 29:24.681
Undoubtedly.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.850
I'm not going to lie...

30:10.935 --> 30:12.312
Oh, my word, girls,

30:12.395 --> 30:16.357
regard how opulently
reappointed it has been.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.360
He must be even more
wealthy than we imagined.

30:19.986 --> 30:24.032
It would have cost a small fortune, of course,
to get the zombie blood out of the marble.

30:24.115 --> 30:26.409
Mrs. Bennet, Miss Bennet,

30:26.826 --> 30:29.579
Miss Bennet and Miss Bennet.

30:30.413 --> 30:32.582
Mrs. Bennet, I am so glad to see you.

30:32.665 --> 30:36.085
Oh, and sadly at
distressing circumstances.

30:36.169 --> 30:38.338
Are you here to take Jane home?

30:38.421 --> 30:39.839
- No.
- Yes!

30:40.673 --> 30:43.635
We must not trespass any longer
on your kindness.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.095
Surely, she is too ill to be moved.

30:46.179 --> 30:47.639
She... She does look very pale.

30:47.722 --> 30:49.724
Bingley, I must protest.

30:50.433 --> 30:51.726
Bingley, please.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.603
Carelessness when dealing
with a zombie infection

30:53.686 --> 30:55.230
could lead to your abrupt demise.

30:55.313 --> 30:57.482
Arrogance could lead to yours.

30:57.815 --> 31:01.653
Your defect, Miss Bennet,
besides eavesdropping,

31:01.736 --> 31:03.863
is to willfully misunderstand people.

31:03.947 --> 31:06.866
And yours is to be
unjustly prejudiced against them.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.618
Come on, Eliza. Come on.

31:13.248 --> 31:17.877
Mr. Bingley, I know just the thing
to break this terrible tension and...

31:17.961 --> 31:20.046
And lift the spirits of the county.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.881
A ball at Netherfield.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.174
Out of the question.

31:23.258 --> 31:24.842
The security arrangements alone...

31:24.926 --> 31:26.511
It's a brilliant idea.

31:26.594 --> 31:29.472
When Jane is recovered you shall,
if you please, name the day.

31:30.139 --> 31:31.432
I should be honored.

31:40.108 --> 31:41.442
All right.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.501
Look at her.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.671
We could've stayed on
for another week in that palace.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.507
I'd risk a cold before
I'd risk Darcy's blade.

32:08.386 --> 32:12.056
Oh, Mrs. Beacham's orphanage fell.

32:23.359 --> 32:26.738
<i>There will be an addition to our party
for dinner tonight.</i>

32:31.576 --> 32:34.120
It would appear your
health is fully restored.

32:34.203 --> 32:36.164
Quite recovered, Papa.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.207
I know of no one who is coming.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.127
The person of whom I speak

32:42.295 --> 32:43.963
is a certain gentleman.

32:48.217 --> 32:50.303
Let me see.

32:50.386 --> 32:51.471
Who is it?

32:51.554 --> 32:53.598
"A certain gentleman."

32:54.182 --> 32:56.392
What is that odious man doing?

32:57.310 --> 33:00.188
He is perusing his future property.

33:04.567 --> 33:08.071
See, this estate must, by law,
go to a male heir.

33:08.655 --> 33:11.658
Now that "odious man," Mr. Collins,

33:12.075 --> 33:17.455
may, the moment I am dead, toss you all
out of this house at his pleasure.

33:20.416 --> 33:23.336
Tell me, to which of my fair cousins
do I owe the compliments

33:23.503 --> 33:26.923
of the excellent,
and I repeat, excellent cooking?

33:27.006 --> 33:30.343
My daughters were trained for battle, sir.
Not the kitchen.

33:30.510 --> 33:31.761
Quite, Mr. Bennet.

33:32.261 --> 33:35.723
My patroness is not only
the King's richest subject,

33:35.932 --> 33:37.058
but deadliest.

33:37.558 --> 33:40.478
Singularly dedicated
to the annihilation of the undead.

33:40.812 --> 33:44.691
I assume you have all heard
of Lady Catherine de Bourgh?

33:50.321 --> 33:53.408
She's the most deadly swordswoman
in all of Great Britain.

33:53.491 --> 33:55.201
With the agility of a black panther.

33:55.451 --> 33:59.455
My humble abode abuts
Her Ladyship's estate, Rosings Park.

33:59.580 --> 34:00.748
Was she ever married?

34:00.832 --> 34:01.916
Widowed, sadly.

34:01.999 --> 34:05.586
She has one daughter, Anne,
who is unfortunately of a sickly constitution.

34:05.670 --> 34:06.754
Has Anne been presented?

34:06.838 --> 34:09.132
Oh, no. No, Mrs. Bennet.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.384
Her ill health prevents it.

34:11.467 --> 34:15.429
I told Lady Catherine that the court
has been deprived of its brightest ornament.

34:16.347 --> 34:20.101
I have a talent, you see, for delivering
these very delicate compliments

34:20.184 --> 34:21.268
with an unstudied air.

34:22.061 --> 34:25.940
It would seem, sir,
that all you lack now is a wife.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.110
I must confess, Mrs. Bennet,

34:30.695 --> 34:33.739
the fairest wifely choices
be right here in this room.

34:35.992 --> 34:38.661
I declare that I am

34:39.328 --> 34:41.121
enchanted by your daughter, Jane.

34:41.998 --> 34:45.501
And request to speak to her alone,
if I may.

34:45.752 --> 34:47.170
Oh, dear Parson.

34:47.378 --> 34:49.088
I'm afraid Jane is already spoken for.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.340
We expect a serious proposal imminently.

34:53.885 --> 34:55.261
Oh, fuddle.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.763
But Liz is quite available,

34:57.346 --> 34:58.848
and almost as fair as Jane.

34:59.182 --> 35:00.933
- What?
- What?

35:02.101 --> 35:04.353
Is there absolutely no
negotiating over Jane?

35:04.437 --> 35:07.106
- The early bird catches the worm, Mr. Collins.
- Oh, indeed.

35:07.190 --> 35:10.401
Be mindful of your talent
for the delicate compliment, sir.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.112
Oh, no. Yeah... Why, yes...

35:13.196 --> 35:17.241
She is almost as fair as the other one.

35:18.201 --> 35:19.535
Splendid.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.204
<i>Thank you, ladies.</i>

35:21.454 --> 35:22.455
Settle down.

35:22.538 --> 35:23.956
Now, I thought this morning,

35:24.040 --> 35:28.044
I might read to you
from Fordyce's <i>Sermons To Young Women.</i>

35:28.336 --> 35:30.046
- What a treat.
- What a treat.

35:30.546 --> 35:32.507
"Chapter One, The Home."

35:32.965 --> 35:34.967
We're walking to Meryton
to visit Aunt Phillips.

35:35.051 --> 35:37.887
So long as Jane and Lizzy
are willing to accompany you.

35:38.221 --> 35:39.388
We most certainly are.

35:39.889 --> 35:41.933
And Mr. Collins, of course.

35:42.475 --> 35:43.476
Well, I should be delighted,

35:43.559 --> 35:47.396
but only if Mr. Bennet will consent
to release me from my reading.

35:47.772 --> 35:49.398
With a heavy heart, sir.

35:49.690 --> 35:54.070
Mr. Bennet, I am susceptible to flattery,
and you, sir, are very charming.

35:54.445 --> 35:55.530
Come along, ladies.

35:56.489 --> 35:58.282
<i>Miss Elizabeth,
how charming you look today.</i>

35:58.950 --> 36:02.328
Let us look in the shop windows of Meryton
and we can buy some new pots and pans

36:02.411 --> 36:04.872
to take the place
of your swords and daggers.

36:12.463 --> 36:13.663
Is there some sort of trouble?

36:14.423 --> 36:15.716
Oh, it appears there is.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.600
Penny McGregor's carriage.

36:24.684 --> 36:25.768
Help!

36:26.102 --> 36:27.436
Someone's trapped inside.

36:27.562 --> 36:28.938
- Jane.
- Please!

36:30.857 --> 36:32.608
There's been an accident!

36:33.192 --> 36:36.612
Please help me! Anyone! Please!

36:37.154 --> 36:38.281
Help!

36:46.038 --> 36:47.790
There was a horrible accident,

36:50.209 --> 36:51.419
but I survived.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.713
I survived, Janey.

36:53.963 --> 36:55.631
Not in the traditional sense of the word.

37:02.972 --> 37:06.267
It appears Miss McGregor
won't be delivering any more lamp oil.

37:07.810 --> 37:08.936
I must confess,

37:09.478 --> 37:14.775
I was unaware that zombies possessed
the required acuity to set such traps.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.315
Before we know it,
they'll be running for Parliament.

37:20.823 --> 37:21.866
Come along.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.829
Fantastic. We must try
and make elevenses, actually.

37:26.913 --> 37:29.749
Come along, Elizabeth. We mustn't dawdle,
we can't be late.

37:33.502 --> 37:36.297
- Miss Bennet.
- Thank you, Mr. Collins.

37:36.631 --> 37:38.215
Allow me.

37:40.134 --> 37:43.346
Gallantry isn't dead. Come, come now.
We mustn't be late.

37:47.016 --> 37:49.143
Keep your eyes peeled for zombies!

37:49.226 --> 37:51.395
No one walks alone!

37:51.479 --> 37:55.524
This must be the extra militia
they stationed here in Meryton.

37:55.942 --> 37:58.277
Oh, Kitty, look at him.

38:00.529 --> 38:01.572
- Good day.
- How are you?

38:01.656 --> 38:02.698
- Kitty. Lydia.
- Hi.

38:02.782 --> 38:04.075
Lieutenant Denny!

38:07.828 --> 38:09.163
Who's that with him?

38:11.374 --> 38:14.293
Miss Lydia Bennet and
Miss Catherine Bennet. Lieutenant Wickham,

38:14.377 --> 38:15.962
who has just been assigned
to our Meryton regiment

38:16.045 --> 38:18.130
to deal with the zombie resurgence.

38:18.214 --> 38:20.800
I bet you're fearful handsome
in your regimentals.

38:20.883 --> 38:22.677
Kitty, Lydia.

38:24.011 --> 38:26.055
Miss Jane Bennet, Miss Elizabeth Bennet,
may I introduce...

38:26.138 --> 38:27.723
- George Wickham.
- He's a lieutenant.

38:28.933 --> 38:30.393
This is our cousin, Mr. Collins.

38:31.227 --> 38:32.436
Parson Collins.

38:34.105 --> 38:35.505
Aren't we overdue at the Phillips'?

38:37.692 --> 38:38.734
Walk us.

38:38.985 --> 38:40.444
I fear I have a prior engagement.

38:40.820 --> 38:41.946
Mr. Wickham?

38:42.446 --> 38:43.489
Yes. Enchanted.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.784
- She is baking, so we mustn't be late.
- Lydia.

38:47.243 --> 38:48.869
I said she is baking.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.706
I was very keen to be on time

38:51.789 --> 38:54.583
because, apparently,
Aunt Phillips' muffins are splendid, you see.

38:54.709 --> 38:55.751
Is that so?

38:55.835 --> 38:58.504
Yeah, and Lady Catherine herself
abhors tardiness,

38:58.921 --> 39:02.425
and actually it's instilled me
with a real sense of order.

39:03.634 --> 39:06.595
Thank you for accompanying us
and enduring my younger sisters.

39:07.763 --> 39:08.889
It's my pleasure.

39:10.266 --> 39:12.586
Are you going to be stationed here
all winter, Mr. Wickham?

39:12.893 --> 39:14.395
Well that depends entirely
on what the manky dreadfuls

39:14.478 --> 39:15.838
have in store for us, Miss Bennet.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.109
Mr. Bingley.

39:24.071 --> 39:25.614
We were just on our way to Longbourn.

39:26.574 --> 39:30.119
Mr. Bingley, you promised
you'd throw a ball at Netherfield.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.789
- Are you quite recovered?
- She is.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.042
Then I shall begin
the preparations immediately

39:36.125 --> 39:38.711
for the most glorious ball
Hertfordshire has ever seen.

39:39.795 --> 39:41.130
Can Lieutenant Wickham come?

39:44.925 --> 39:48.262
Of course, an invitation shall be sent
to all my fellow officers.

39:52.475 --> 39:53.726
Excuse me.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.480
Good day, Miss Jane.

39:58.898 --> 40:01.025
There you are, my beautiful nieces.

40:06.822 --> 40:07.942
Please join us, Mr. Wickham.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.533
No. Duty calls, I'm afraid.

40:12.828 --> 40:14.497
I must know, Mr. Wickham,

40:16.207 --> 40:18.209
what is amiss between you and Mr. Darcy?

40:21.420 --> 40:22.740
Are you much acquainted with him?

40:23.464 --> 40:24.673
More than I wish to be.

40:25.174 --> 40:26.425
He's been here for less than a month

40:26.509 --> 40:28.509
and is already the least popular man
in the county.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.306
Yes, it always gives me
great pain to see him.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.683
I have been connected with his family
from infancy.

40:34.767 --> 40:36.852
My father managed
the late Mr. Darcy's estate.

40:37.728 --> 40:38.979
Darcy and I grew up together.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.941
His father treated me like a second son.

40:42.316 --> 40:44.116
I cannot begin to do
justice to his kindness.

40:45.111 --> 40:47.071
He bequeathed me with
the best living in his gift.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.989
I had my heart set on joining the church.

40:50.199 --> 40:52.034
But when he was slain
in the Second Battle of Kent,

40:52.118 --> 40:54.438
Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave my living to another man.

40:55.538 --> 40:58.082
What could have induced him
to behave so cruelly?

40:59.500 --> 41:00.501
Pride.

41:02.044 --> 41:04.213
He thought me too low
to be worth his consideration.

41:04.797 --> 41:06.957
I loved his father dearly,
so, I can never expose Darcy

41:07.007 --> 41:08.087
or challenge him to a duel.

41:08.217 --> 41:09.468
Come now, Lizzy!

41:10.427 --> 41:12.263
We must plan our trip to the North Country.

41:12.429 --> 41:13.639
I'll be right there.

41:16.142 --> 41:18.182
Well, perhaps I shall see you
at Mr. Bingley's ball?

41:19.061 --> 41:20.062
Perhaps.

41:22.815 --> 41:23.816
I'll be there.

41:43.252 --> 41:44.378
Oh, dear.

42:32.092 --> 42:33.135
Beg your pardon.

42:54.240 --> 42:56.700
Mr. Wickham, you came.

42:57.117 --> 42:58.160
As I said I would.

42:58.869 --> 43:01.455
I feared that Mr. Darcy's presence
would keep you away.

43:01.830 --> 43:04.291
If Darcy wishes to avoid me,
he must go, not I.

43:05.459 --> 43:06.919
I have found you, Miss Bennet!

43:09.755 --> 43:10.798
Sorry, and you are?

43:11.757 --> 43:12.800
Wickham.

43:13.342 --> 43:16.095
Mr. Wickham. I never forget a face,

43:16.178 --> 43:17.972
especially one as angelic as Miss Bennet's.

43:18.055 --> 43:19.807
I do hope you haven't forgotten our dance?

43:20.349 --> 43:22.268
Of course not, Parson Collins.

43:22.726 --> 43:25.145
- Oh, allow me.
- Thank you, Mr. Wickham.

43:26.146 --> 43:29.108
Lady Catherine herself has praised me
on my lightness of foot.

43:31.151 --> 43:34.488
Wonder, sir, how you found the time
to hone such delicacy in your steps.

43:34.571 --> 43:36.371
Flattery will get you everywhere,
Miss Bennet.

43:37.199 --> 43:38.242
Dear...

43:38.534 --> 43:39.827
The dance seems to be getting away with us.

43:39.910 --> 43:42.288
I think it only right and proper
that every clergyman

43:42.371 --> 43:44.790
should set the example
for matrimony in the parish.

43:50.045 --> 43:51.880
This is my favorite moment of the dance.

43:52.047 --> 43:53.924
And now the party's in full swing.

43:56.093 --> 43:57.970
Such splendor in the air.

43:58.095 --> 44:01.515
A parson may no longer lead a chaste life,
my fair cousin.

44:01.724 --> 44:03.892
Mr. Collins, please keep your voice down.

44:07.229 --> 44:08.272
Splendid.

44:08.772 --> 44:10.399
Splendid work, everyone.

44:10.733 --> 44:12.151
Thank you for your attention.

44:12.526 --> 44:13.736
Everyone did valiantly.

44:14.069 --> 44:16.989
Miss Bennet, it is my intention
to remain very close to you

44:17.072 --> 44:18.490
throughout all the evening.

44:19.283 --> 44:20.909
- May I have the next dance?
- Yes.

44:30.127 --> 44:31.462
Mr. Darcy, this is Mr. Collins.

44:31.754 --> 44:33.505
- Parson Collins.
- Parson Collins.

44:35.132 --> 44:36.258
Your...

44:37.593 --> 44:38.844
He's my cousin.

44:39.553 --> 44:43.140
Mr. Darcy, I have made the
most incredible discovery...

44:43.223 --> 44:46.977
Nay. Tosh. An extraordinary discovery, sir.

44:47.061 --> 44:50.647
You are the nephew
of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

44:54.193 --> 44:55.277
I know.

44:56.570 --> 44:57.905
Well, I know you know.

44:57.988 --> 44:59.198
Allow me to do the honor of
introducing myself...

44:59.281 --> 45:00.407
- Please excuse me.
- Please excuse me.

45:00.491 --> 45:02.618
I am Parson Collins.

45:03.369 --> 45:05.287
My humble abode abuts Her Ladyship's...

45:05.371 --> 45:10.000
I predict a wedding in under three months.

45:10.125 --> 45:12.795
He's such a charming young man,

45:13.504 --> 45:14.963
and so...

45:16.215 --> 45:17.216
Well, rich.

45:17.841 --> 45:20.844
Jane marrying Bingley
is bound to throw her younger sisters

45:20.928 --> 45:22.805
in the way of other rich men.

45:22.888 --> 45:23.889
And then...

45:24.640 --> 45:26.141
Mother, it's time to go.

45:27.810 --> 45:29.269
Don't be so impertinent.

45:30.771 --> 45:31.897
Mr. Darcy overheard you.

45:31.980 --> 45:34.817
What is Mr. Darcy to me,
pray, that I should be afraid of him?

45:34.900 --> 45:36.860
I can't find Papa or Lydia anywhere.

45:37.194 --> 45:40.114
Papa will be in the library
and I'll find that stupid girl.

45:45.828 --> 45:47.830
Edwin, where is dessert?

45:49.331 --> 45:50.749
Hello, Mrs... Hello, Miss Bennett.

45:51.500 --> 45:52.626
Sir?

45:54.670 --> 45:55.754
Sir?

45:56.505 --> 45:57.745
We must find Darcy immediately.

45:57.840 --> 45:58.924
There's no time.

46:01.969 --> 46:02.970
Mr. Bingley.

46:04.388 --> 46:05.472
Yes.

46:13.397 --> 46:15.065
All the lanterns have been snuffed out.

46:16.191 --> 46:17.401
Mind your step, Miss Bennet.

46:26.535 --> 46:27.661
Mr. Bingley.

46:37.421 --> 46:38.881
You're Mrs. Beacham's orphans.

46:39.089 --> 46:40.382
We were, Miss Bennet.

46:42.092 --> 46:43.260
How did you get in here?

46:43.385 --> 46:46.054
Our new friend showed us the way in.

46:57.399 --> 46:58.442
Mr. Darcy!

47:19.505 --> 47:20.839
Was he bitten?

47:24.468 --> 47:25.677
- Was he bitten?
- No.

47:26.845 --> 47:28.430
No, he fell and hit his head.

47:33.185 --> 47:34.269
Bingley.

47:35.103 --> 47:36.271
Bingley, wake up.

47:36.522 --> 47:37.606
Come on, chap.

47:46.114 --> 47:48.784
Your abilities as a warrior
are beyond reproach, Mr. Darcy.

47:50.285 --> 47:51.645
If only you were as good a friend.

48:16.603 --> 48:19.147
<i>"Dear Jane, we have decided
to close down Netherfield</i>

48:19.231 --> 48:20.357
<i>"and return to London.</i>

48:20.816 --> 48:22.651
<i>"We are not sure when we shall return."</i>

48:22.985 --> 48:25.279
<i>The Bingleys just closed down the house
and left?</i>

48:26.113 --> 48:29.241
I don't understand. Why would he not know
when he is to return?

48:29.616 --> 48:30.993
According to Caroline Bingley,

48:31.535 --> 48:33.787
<i>"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister.</i>

48:34.162 --> 48:36.081
<i>"My brother admires her greatly already.</i>

48:36.623 --> 48:39.501
<i>"He will now be seeing her frequently
and on the most intimate footing.</i>

48:40.377 --> 48:43.255
"Am I wrong, my dearest Jane,
in indulging the hope of an event

48:43.338 --> 48:45.340
"which will secure the happiness
of so many?"

48:45.424 --> 48:47.926
Obviously, she knows
her brother is in love with you,

48:48.010 --> 48:49.761
and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.

48:52.139 --> 48:55.809
If Mr. Bingley truly loves me,
nothing can keep us apart.

48:57.227 --> 48:59.980
No one who has ever seen you together
can doubt his affection.

49:04.026 --> 49:06.028
I'm sure Mr. Bingley will be back soon.

49:06.445 --> 49:08.280
<i>And that there's a good
reason for all this.</i>

49:15.787 --> 49:16.872
Ladies.

49:17.456 --> 49:18.874
Good morrow.

49:40.896 --> 49:44.733
Mr. Collins would like a private audience
with your sister.

49:46.610 --> 49:47.653
Lydia.

49:47.736 --> 49:50.489
- What, with Liz?
- Out. Out. Everyone out.

49:50.572 --> 49:52.452
Mama, please, he has
nothing to say. He can't...

49:53.575 --> 49:56.745
Jane, please don't. Please, please...

50:01.458 --> 50:03.502
Miss Elizabeth,
as soon as I entered the house

50:03.585 --> 50:05.962
I singled you out
as the companion for my future life.

50:06.546 --> 50:07.547
Oh, no.

50:07.631 --> 50:11.677
I am convinced marrying you
will add very greatly to my happiness.

50:12.761 --> 50:14.179
But, actually, I must add,

50:14.262 --> 50:17.808
I will of course require you
to retire your warrior skills

50:17.933 --> 50:19.559
as part of the marital submission.

50:20.227 --> 50:22.229
We absolutely can't have swords
in the home.

50:22.521 --> 50:24.523
And now, Miss Elizabeth,

50:24.898 --> 50:27.192
allow me to assure you
in the most animated language

50:27.275 --> 50:30.696
of the violence, the sheer violence
of my affections.

50:30.779 --> 50:33.448
- Sir, I am honored by your proposal.
- Thank you.

50:33.615 --> 50:34.616
I am,

50:34.866 --> 50:36.535
but I regret, I must refuse.

50:37.994 --> 50:41.331
Lizzy, I insist you marry Mr. Collins.

50:41.540 --> 50:42.541
No!

50:42.624 --> 50:44.960
Do not worry, Mr. Collins.
She shall be brought to reason.

50:45.085 --> 50:46.211
- Oh, good.
- No.

50:46.294 --> 50:47.337
Oh, no...

50:47.421 --> 50:48.421
I'm terribly sorry.

50:48.463 --> 50:50.924
Now, Elizabeth Bennet, you get back there.
You get back there.

50:51.049 --> 50:52.926
- No.
- And you face up to your future...

50:53.218 --> 50:55.971
Excuse me. Mr. Bennet!

50:56.555 --> 51:00.851
You must come and make Lizzy marry
Mr. Collins, for she refuses to have him!

51:02.477 --> 51:03.478
Bugger.

51:04.521 --> 51:05.814
Lizzy!

51:06.857 --> 51:11.236
Lizzy, you will marry Mr. Collins or
I shall never speak to you again!

51:13.155 --> 51:14.281
You talk to her.

51:15.949 --> 51:19.953
Lizzy! An unhappy
alternative is before you.

51:20.829 --> 51:24.541
Your mother will never speak to you again
if you do not marry Mr. Collins.

51:25.167 --> 51:28.211
And I will never speak
to you again if you do.

51:34.426 --> 51:37.012
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?

51:37.137 --> 51:38.805
No one, Elizabeth Bennet!

51:38.972 --> 51:42.184
You shall become
a poor and pathetic spinster!

51:42.267 --> 51:43.393
Anything.

51:43.685 --> 51:46.521
Anything is to be preferred or endured

51:46.897 --> 51:49.274
rather than marrying without affection!

51:51.777 --> 51:52.778
Lizzy.

51:53.195 --> 51:55.530
Lizzy, don't go into the woods alone!

51:56.823 --> 51:58.033
Lizzy!

51:58.158 --> 51:59.826
I forbid you!

52:23.892 --> 52:25.060
Elizabeth.

52:27.020 --> 52:28.146
Mr. Wickham.

52:35.570 --> 52:36.905
You vanished at the ball.

52:37.155 --> 52:38.323
Yes.

52:38.406 --> 52:41.409
I thought it would've been selfish of me
to seek an encounter with Darcy.

52:41.493 --> 52:43.573
Would've ruined the ball
for anyone who witnessed it.

52:43.620 --> 52:47.207
I am very sorry I lost the pleasure
of dancing with you, though.

52:47.290 --> 52:50.502
Did you happen to see
four gentlemen pass this way?

52:51.753 --> 52:53.797
- In top hats?
- You saw them?

52:53.922 --> 52:57.217
No, but they were undoubtedly pallbearers.

52:57.425 --> 52:58.510
This is a cemetery.

53:00.554 --> 53:01.596
Miss Bennet?

53:03.682 --> 53:06.101
I want to take you somewhere
very special to me.

53:06.977 --> 53:09.217
It's a secret place
I've never shown another living soul.

53:12.148 --> 53:16.278
I stumbled upon it quite by accident when
I was first stationed in The In-Between.

53:16.486 --> 53:19.865
But somehow, I believe I was
always destined to find it, Miss Bennet.

53:43.555 --> 53:46.766
You go in.
I'll join you after I see to my horse.

53:51.813 --> 53:52.939
Don't be afraid.

53:54.941 --> 53:55.984
I'm not.

54:00.655 --> 54:02.991
"And I brought your fathers out of Egypt.

54:03.074 --> 54:05.243
"And ye came unto the sea,

54:05.327 --> 54:09.873
"and the Egyptians crowded their fathers
with chariots and horsemen

54:09.956 --> 54:11.207
"to the Red Sea.

54:11.291 --> 54:12.918
"And when they cried unto the Lord,

54:13.001 --> 54:16.171
"he put darkness between
you and the Egyptians,

54:16.546 --> 54:18.298
"and brought this upon them.

54:19.549 --> 54:22.928
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

54:23.845 --> 54:25.931
"yet shall he live."

54:27.432 --> 54:28.433
You're quite rude.

54:28.516 --> 54:31.394
"And Jesus cried out with a loud voice,

54:31.895 --> 54:33.521
""Lazarus, come out!""

54:33.855 --> 54:35.523
No, don't! Don't.

54:37.359 --> 54:38.360
It's all right.

54:39.361 --> 54:40.362
It's all right.

54:40.445 --> 54:44.449
"Happy are those
who are called to his supper.

54:50.372 --> 54:53.208
"The locusts have no king.

54:53.625 --> 54:57.420
"Yet all of them go forth,
marching in rank.

54:59.214 --> 55:03.718
"What the cutting locust left,
the swarming locust has eaten.

55:04.260 --> 55:05.553
"What the swarming locust...

55:05.637 --> 55:07.722
- Brains.
- No. They're pigs' brains.

55:08.515 --> 55:09.557
You have nothing to fear.

55:10.266 --> 55:12.477
You see, if they never consume human brains

55:12.560 --> 55:15.063
they will never fully
transform into zombies.

55:15.563 --> 55:19.317
St. Lazarus is the key to finally ending the
struggle between the living and the undead.

55:19.401 --> 55:23.029
We must force some kind of understanding
with the most advanced among them.

55:23.405 --> 55:26.116
Well, surely the Crown
will support such a venture.

55:26.574 --> 55:29.369
The war has almost
bankrupted Great Britain.

55:29.452 --> 55:31.079
I know not where to turn.

55:32.414 --> 55:35.125
It's only a matter of time
before they outnumber us.

55:37.168 --> 55:39.546
Rider at the gates!

55:39.629 --> 55:42.173
Attention!

55:50.265 --> 55:51.850
- Liz?
- Charlotte?

55:52.183 --> 55:54.185
I didn't know you were coming to visit.

55:54.269 --> 55:55.729
I have some news.

55:57.689 --> 56:00.233
I'm engaged to be married to Mr. Collins.

56:04.988 --> 56:06.239
You must be surprised.

56:06.698 --> 56:08.324
I'm not. I'm relieved.

56:08.950 --> 56:10.368
I believe that
my chance of happiness with him

56:10.452 --> 56:13.121
is as fair as most women can hope for.

56:15.623 --> 56:17.584
And that's all you expect?

56:17.667 --> 56:19.669
At 25, it's more than I expect.

56:24.674 --> 56:30.472
Charlotte, if you're happy for you,
then I am, too.

56:33.725 --> 56:36.061
Well, I am to be presented
to Lady Catherine

56:36.144 --> 56:39.064
and if I am to stay
the night at Mr. Collins' rectory,

56:39.147 --> 56:41.066
I will require a chaperone.

56:42.817 --> 56:45.320
- Charlotte...
- She's said to be quite an imposing figure.

56:45.403 --> 56:48.573
And the thought of facing her without you
makes me deathly nervous.

56:48.656 --> 56:50.158
So, please?

56:56.664 --> 57:01.419
I'll come, but I have one stipulation.

57:01.503 --> 57:02.921
Anything.

57:03.004 --> 57:06.633
Now, when we meet Lady Catherine,
a simple curtsey will suffice.

57:06.716 --> 57:11.012
Maintain eye contact,
but don't speak unless spoken to, please.

57:12.472 --> 57:14.933
Lady Catherine's famed Black Guard.

57:15.016 --> 57:16.684
They can't move.

57:16.768 --> 57:20.355
Here, look at this,
you could tickle him with a feather.

57:20.897 --> 57:22.440
Lower the gates!

57:22.524 --> 57:25.944
An extraordinary sight, is it not?

57:27.862 --> 57:30.615
Such splendor.

57:34.828 --> 57:37.622
<i>Lady Catherine Smiting the Undead Lucifer.</i>

57:37.705 --> 57:38.790
Majestic.

57:43.795 --> 57:44.796
Elizabeth Bennet.

57:50.135 --> 57:52.262
<i>The Four Horsemen
of the Zombie Apocalypse.</i>

57:52.345 --> 57:55.390
When they appear, the end of days is neigh.

57:55.515 --> 57:57.058
This way, miss.

58:01.604 --> 58:04.774
Parson Collins,
Miss Lucas, and Miss Bennet.

58:09.904 --> 58:11.072
I'm sorry.

58:11.990 --> 58:13.533
Lady Catherine.

58:14.742 --> 58:16.244
Miss De Bourgh.

58:17.370 --> 58:18.621
Lady Catherine.

58:19.122 --> 58:21.249
So you are Elizabeth Bennet.

58:21.624 --> 58:23.626
Yes. I am, Your Ladyship.

58:26.921 --> 58:28.673
This is my daughter.

58:33.011 --> 58:37.724
Well, it's very kind of you to invite us
over for tea, Lady Catherine. Really.

58:37.807 --> 58:39.309
Very grateful.

58:40.435 --> 58:41.436
Mr. Darcy?

58:43.563 --> 58:44.606
Miss Bennet.

58:45.732 --> 58:47.317
You know my nephew?

58:48.318 --> 58:51.029
Yes, I had the tremendous pleasure
of meeting him in Hertfordshire.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.364
Mr. Wickham.

58:54.115 --> 58:56.284
- Is this the soldier you spoke of?
- Yes.

58:56.367 --> 58:59.412
Miss Bennet requested he attend,
that he might confer with Your Ladyship

58:59.495 --> 59:02.290
about a strategy
with which to combat the scourge.

59:02.874 --> 59:05.043
A lieutenant? Really?

59:05.126 --> 59:06.127
Indeed.

59:06.211 --> 59:08.213
And tea is brought up.

59:08.296 --> 59:10.506
- Shall we?
- Delighted to.

59:10.590 --> 59:11.591
Please.

59:13.343 --> 59:15.783
I have given you entry
to the wealthiest woman in the kingdom.

59:17.597 --> 59:19.432
The rest is up to you.

59:22.060 --> 59:23.186
<i>Your Ladyship has perhaps heard</i>

59:23.269 --> 59:24.771
that some of the stricken
have not succumbed

59:24.854 --> 59:26.189
to the urge to feed upon the living,

59:26.314 --> 59:28.566
and in so doing
have maintained their human ways.

59:28.650 --> 59:32.237
And they have managed to resist
this most primal of zombie urges, how?

59:32.320 --> 59:34.447
Their iron-clad constitutions?

59:36.115 --> 59:39.118
Yes, fortified by religious piety
and pigs' brains,

59:39.202 --> 59:41.120
which they receive in communion
as the blood of Christ.

59:41.204 --> 59:44.040
The pig brains quench their appetite
for human brains.

59:44.624 --> 59:45.750
Yes, of course.

59:45.833 --> 59:47.418
The Crown's funds have been drained.

59:47.502 --> 59:49.629
You're here to solicit money?

59:49.712 --> 59:52.215
I am here to propose a venture
that would end the war forever.

59:52.298 --> 59:54.968
These new zombies can be reasoned with.

59:55.051 --> 59:57.303
With the proper funding,
I believe we can cultivate trust

59:57.387 --> 01:00:00.390
and even goodwill
with this new iteration of the undead,

01:00:00.473 --> 01:00:03.810
who seem to possess an inherent power
over the lower ranks of their kind.

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:08.690
Zombie aristocrats?

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:13.069
Oh, yeah.

01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:17.532
I prefer to think of them
as souls lost in purgatory.

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.368
The common hordes
look to them for leadership.

01:00:20.493 --> 01:00:22.495
It takes just one of them
to realize their power

01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:23.830
and then to lead the hordes into battle...

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:25.748
- The undead are like locusts.
- Locusts.

01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:29.877
They go forth and destroy.
They have no use for leaders.

01:00:30.712 --> 01:00:32.213
Except one. Actually.

01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:37.593
Well, according to
the Book of Revelation, actually,

01:00:37.677 --> 01:00:40.680
the Antichrist shall lead the undead

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:45.560
on the day that shall be
the last day of mankind.

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.770
- How cheery, Collins.
- Thank you, Lady Catherine.

01:00:47.854 --> 01:00:50.565
Very generous.
Franklin, are there more scones?

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.608
If we could negotiate
with this select group of...

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.902
Aristocrats? To what end?

01:00:54.986 --> 01:00:57.864
- A treaty.
- Appeasement?

01:00:57.947 --> 01:00:58.990
Never.

01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:01.409
Well, then the human race is surely doomed.

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:05.830
Your Ladyship,
the undead will always multiply faster

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:07.332
than the living can procreate.

01:01:07.415 --> 01:01:10.418
Nine months to make a baby,
then 16 years to make a soldier,

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:12.545
and one raw second to make a zombie.

01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:16.132
You must realize, if they were to organize,
we cannot defeat them.

01:01:16.257 --> 01:01:18.885
The only hope is to find a way
to coexist with them,

01:01:18.968 --> 01:01:21.846
before they find their Antichrist.

01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:26.592
The late Mr. Darcy
would have supported such a venture.

01:01:28.478 --> 01:01:31.230
I have tolerated your presence here
long enough, Wickham.

01:01:31.773 --> 01:01:32.940
Guards.

01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:42.200
Please do remember this moment,

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:44.535
and the opportunity so glibly spurned.

01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:47.747
The day of the zombie has already broken.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:50.666
Wake and face the light,
or slumber into oblivion.

01:02:03.096 --> 01:02:06.641
Mr. Darcy, you are
as unfeeling as the undead.

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:15.691
My word,

01:02:15.817 --> 01:02:19.946
you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person.

01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:21.239
Indeed, Lady Catherine.

01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:23.574
Well, I would like to say
how dutifully behaved I think

01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:24.951
Lady Anne has been this morning.

01:02:25.034 --> 01:02:27.161
A real credit to the crest, actually.

01:02:29.414 --> 01:02:30.915
Would you like a scone, dear?

01:03:35.396 --> 01:03:37.857
I didn't mean to frighten you.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.025
You didn't.

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:41.444
No. Of course not.

01:03:41.527 --> 01:03:43.821
Rosings is the safest place in England.

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:47.074
You see, that's the problem.

01:03:47.617 --> 01:03:49.577
Aristos feel invincible
within their great houses,

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.079
but how wrong they are.

01:03:52.163 --> 01:03:53.915
Their hubris will be their downfall.

01:03:54.916 --> 01:03:56.292
"Downfall"?

01:03:57.585 --> 01:04:00.171
You act as if
the undead had already defeated us.

01:04:03.174 --> 01:04:05.214
I think you and I
understand each other, Liz Bennet.

01:04:09.347 --> 01:04:10.932
Well, the way you championed me earlier,
I thought...

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:14.435
Mr. Darcy's treatment of you
has been utterly despicable, but...

01:04:14.519 --> 01:04:17.146
No more despicable than
his treatment of you and your family.

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:19.357
I don't understand you, sir.

01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:23.986
It was Darcy that persuaded Bingley
to stay clear of your sister

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:25.947
and leave Netherfield.

01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:28.616
Why?

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:32.620
Because he believes your sister
be inferior to his friend.

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:34.205
Darcy also convinced Bingley

01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:36.528
that she is after his fortune
and doesn't truly love him.

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:40.044
How could you possibly know this?

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:41.963
Men talk.

01:04:42.088 --> 01:04:44.674
Darcy brags about it with his intimates.

01:04:46.968 --> 01:04:48.761
Miss Bennet, run away with me.

01:04:53.808 --> 01:04:55.935
You have crossed a line, sir.

01:04:57.562 --> 01:05:00.273
We're far beyond lines now, Miss Bennet.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:06.946
Take heed of the parson, Miss Bennet.

01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:09.490
The day of reckoning is upon us.

01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:43.858
Charlotte?

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:46.777
Charlotte?

01:06:13.763 --> 01:06:15.222
- Mr. Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

01:06:16.557 --> 01:06:19.185
You've finally arisen. How fortuitous.

01:06:22.897 --> 01:06:25.566
There are some words I must say.

01:06:27.735 --> 01:06:29.528
Please do be seated.

01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:40.539
Miss Bennet, although I know
many consider you to be decidedly inferior,

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:46.253
as a matter of your birth,
your family, and your circumstances,

01:06:46.337 --> 01:06:49.256
my feelings will not be repressed.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.009
In vain have I struggled.

01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:55.638
I have come to feel for you
a most ardent admiration and regard,

01:06:55.721 --> 01:06:58.432
which has overcome my better judgment.

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:05.940
So now I ask you most fervently to end
my turmoil and consent to be my wife.

01:07:11.529 --> 01:07:14.782
If I could feel gratitude,
I would now thank you,

01:07:16.117 --> 01:07:18.077
but I cannot.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.204
I never desired your good opinion,

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:22.998
and you have
certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:38.347
Might I be informed why,

01:07:38.431 --> 01:07:41.684
with so little endeavor at civility,
I am rejected?

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:45.813
You intentionally ruined the happiness
of my most beloved sister.

01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:49.900
- Do you deny it?
- I have no wish to deny it.

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:55.865
I did everything in my power
to separate my friend from your sister.

01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:01.412
How could you?

01:08:02.163 --> 01:08:04.081
Because I perceived
his attachment to her

01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:06.417
to be far deeper than hers to him.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.835
I believed her to be indifferent.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:11.046
Indifferent? She's shy!

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.474
Did you suggest to Mr. Bingley

01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:25.019
that his fortune
had some bearing on the matter?

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:26.770
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonor,

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:28.189
though it was suggested.

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:33.694
By Miss Bingley?

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:35.863
By your mother, at the ball.

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:44.412
Your character was revealed to me
many months ago by Wickham

01:08:44.872 --> 01:08:48.459
as I heard of his scandalous misfortunes
at your hand.

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:51.212
Oh, yeah. Mr. Wickham's misfortunes
have been very great indeed.

01:09:02.348 --> 01:09:05.893
You withhold the advantages
that you know were designed for him.

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:11.232
This is your opinion of me?

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.484
Then I thank you for
explaining it so fully.

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:31.042
You could not have made
the offer of your hand

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:34.880
in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it.

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:37.883
I had not known you a month

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:39.969
before I felt
you were the last man in the world

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.429
whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.

01:09:47.643 --> 01:09:50.104
You've said quite enough, madam.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.231
I fully comprehend your feelings

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:55.234
and now I have only to be ashamed
of what my own have been.

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:05.703
Please forgive me, and accept my
best wishes for your health and happiness.

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:25.890
Hello. Good afternoon.
Wonderful to be back.

01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:27.892
Heavens.

01:10:27.975 --> 01:10:29.894
What happened, Lizzy?

01:10:29.977 --> 01:10:32.229
This is an antique. Irreplaceable.

01:10:32.313 --> 01:10:34.607
Lady Catherine herself
delivered this to me.

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.817
- Mr. Darcy...
- It's from the shores of China.

01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:39.153
Mr. Darcy came by the cottage?

01:10:40.154 --> 01:10:41.530
Came here?

01:10:41.614 --> 01:10:43.282
Fabulous.

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:45.284
This will need clearing up, Elizabeth.

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:16.941
<i>"Dear Miss Elizabeth Bennet,</i>

01:11:19.068 --> 01:11:23.322
<i>"I am not writing to renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you,</i>

01:11:23.405 --> 01:11:26.867
<i>"but to address the two offenses
that you accuse me of.</i>

01:11:26.951 --> 01:11:30.371
<i>"I did not intentionally wound your sister.</i>

01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:34.208
<i>"It was a most unfortunate consequence
of protecting my dearest friend.</i>

01:11:34.959 --> 01:11:37.294
<i>"Mr. Bingley's feelings for Miss Bennet</i>

01:11:37.378 --> 01:11:42.049
<i>"were beyond any I had ever witnessed in
him, or indeed even thought him capable of.</i>

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:45.552
<i>"The evening of the dance at Netherfield,</i>

01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:48.555
<i>"after overhearing your mother
coldly state her intention</i>

01:11:48.639 --> 01:11:51.475
<i>"of having all her
daughters marry favorably,</i>

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:54.311
<i>"I persuaded Bingley
of the unfitness of the match.</i>

01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:59.149
<i>"If I have wounded Miss Bennet's feelings,
it was unknowingly done.</i>

01:11:59.233 --> 01:12:03.028
<i>"As to your other accusation,
of having injured Mr. Wickham,</i>

01:12:03.112 --> 01:12:06.115
<i>"no sooner had my father
made clear his intention</i>

01:12:06.198 --> 01:12:08.659
<i>"to leave Mr. Wickham a handsome sum,</i>

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:13.455
<i>"than Mr. Darcy was mysteriously infected
by the plague.</i>

01:12:13.539 --> 01:12:17.668
<i>"It was left to me, his son,
to provide a merciful ending.</i>

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:29.221
<i>"Still, I gave Wickham
the inheritance my father left.</i>

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:31.348
<i>"Wickham squandered it.</i>

01:12:31.432 --> 01:12:34.601
<i>"Whereupon he demanded
more and more money,</i>

01:12:34.685 --> 01:12:37.021
<i>"until I eventually refused.</i>

01:12:37.104 --> 01:12:39.815
<i>"Thereafter he severed all ties with me.</i>

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:44.278
<i>"Last summer, he began a relationship
with my 15-year-old sister</i>

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:45.821
<i>"and convinced her to elope.</i>

01:12:46.947 --> 01:12:51.326
<i>"Mr. Wickham's prime target
was her inheritance of Â£30,000,</i>

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:54.496
<i>"but revenging himself on me
was a strong additional inducement.</i>

01:12:56.081 --> 01:13:00.502
<i>"Fortunately, I was able to persuade
my sister of Mr. Wickham's ulterior motives</i>

01:13:00.586 --> 01:13:02.463
<i>"before it was too late.</i>

01:13:02.546 --> 01:13:04.631
<i>"I hope this helps explain</i>

01:13:04.715 --> 01:13:08.010
<i>"and perhaps mitigate
my behavior in your eyes.</i>

01:13:08.469 --> 01:13:09.928
<i>"Of all the weapons in the world,</i>

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:13.807
<i>"I now know love to be the most dangerous.</i>

01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:15.976
<i>"For I have suffered a mortal wound.</i>

01:13:16.602 --> 01:13:20.397
<i>"When did I fall so deeply
under your spell, Miss Bennet?</i>

01:13:20.481 --> 01:13:22.608
<i>"I cannot fix the hour or the spot</i>

01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:25.444
<i>"or the look or the words
which laid the foundation.</i>

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:27.946
<i>"I was in the middle
before I knew I had began.</i>

01:13:29.031 --> 01:13:31.533
<i>"What a proud fool I was.</i>

01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:32.785
<i>"I have faced the harsh truth,</i>

01:13:32.868 --> 01:13:36.580
<i>"that I can never hope
to win your love in this life,</i>

01:13:36.663 --> 01:13:39.166
<i>"and so have sought solace in combat.</i>

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.169
<i>"I write to you from the siege of London.</i>

01:13:44.171 --> 01:13:47.591
<i>"There is now a cunning design
to the zombie attacks.</i>

01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:51.637
<i>"I sense a dark hand is at work here,
guiding the enemy, Miss Bennet.</i>

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.099
<i>"By taking London, they've increased
their ranks a hundredfold."</i>

01:13:56.016 --> 01:13:57.142
Come on, lads!

01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:02.564
<i>"Now we endeavor to keep them trapped
within the great wall."</i>

01:14:03.774 --> 01:14:06.485
This wasn't the random act
of some mindless horde.

01:14:06.568 --> 01:14:08.695
They've struck the Palace and both Houses.

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.699
They cut off our head
before we could cut off theirs.

01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:15.077
Keep fighting.

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:17.204
Come on, men!

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:20.958
<i>"If we should fail to contain them
and they breach Hingham Bridge,</i>

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:25.087
<i>"it'll be as if a great dam has broken,
and they'll reach Hertfordshire swiftly.</i>

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:29.466
<i>"And in overwhelming numbers.</i>

01:14:31.135 --> 01:14:34.221
<i>"Dear Miss Bennet,
I implore you to be ready."</i>

01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:40.269
Lizzy!

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:43.689
- Liz!
- Jane!

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:49.361
Jane... Jane, what is it?

01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:51.405
Wickham's run off with Lydia.

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:53.282
She's barely more than a child.

01:14:54.074 --> 01:14:57.119
I never could have imagined
the man to be so improper,

01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:58.579
to be such a blaggard.

01:15:00.706 --> 01:15:02.374
What are we to do?

01:15:09.673 --> 01:15:10.841
St. Lazarus.

01:15:13.927 --> 01:15:15.345
I know where she is.

01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:31.695
You have a very small estate here.

01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:33.280
And yet we endure it.

01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:37.034
I have urgent business to attend to.

01:15:38.619 --> 01:15:42.497
A falsehood of a most scandalous nature
has reached me,

01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:46.210
that you intend to be united
with my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.

01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:47.336
Is this true?

01:15:47.628 --> 01:15:50.214
I do not possess
your frankness, Your Ladyship.

01:15:50.297 --> 01:15:52.382
You may ask questions,
I may not choose to answer.

01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:54.259
Let me be rightly understood, Miss Bennet.

01:15:54.635 --> 01:15:57.387
Darcy has been promised since infancy
to my daughter.

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:02.726
Well, then you can have
no reason to suppose he made me an offer.

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:05.312
Are you engaged to him or not?

01:16:07.231 --> 01:16:08.273
I'm not.

01:16:10.442 --> 01:16:14.988
And will you promise me
never to enter into such an engagement?

01:16:15.072 --> 01:16:17.199
I will make no such promise.

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:21.328
Then I shall protect the dignity
of a far superior man.

01:16:24.373 --> 01:16:27.084
Do you dare to face me in combat?

01:16:27.167 --> 01:16:28.252
I do not.

01:16:28.752 --> 01:16:30.420
For to take arms against you, My Lady,

01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:32.506
would be to take arms against England.

01:16:32.589 --> 01:16:33.632
Quite right.

01:16:34.967 --> 01:16:36.260
My proxywill have to suffice.

01:16:36.343 --> 01:16:37.386
Wilhelm.

01:16:45.185 --> 01:16:48.689
Miss Bennet, do you concede?

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.149
I do not.

01:16:52.317 --> 01:16:55.529
My courage always rises
at every attempt to intimidate me.

01:17:28.312 --> 01:17:30.063
Do you still refuse to oblige me?

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.233
I do!

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:05.182
I do not know
which I admire more, Elizabeth Bennet.

01:18:05.265 --> 01:18:08.143
Your skill as a warrior,

01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:10.312
or your resolve as a woman.

01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:14.274
St. Lazarus is in The In-Between, Papa.

01:18:14.358 --> 01:18:16.109
- You'll never make it.
- Lydia's honor is at stake.

01:18:16.193 --> 01:18:18.487
Stop him, Liz.
He's going after Lydia and Wickham.

01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:19.988
Wait, Papa.

01:18:20.072 --> 01:18:22.908
What's right to do
cannot be done too soon.

01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:25.410
But you don't even know where she is. I do.

01:18:25.494 --> 01:18:27.871
I promise you I won't forsake Lydia.

01:18:27.954 --> 01:18:29.081
I'll go with you.

01:18:29.164 --> 01:18:31.084
No, you must stay here
to help protect Longbourn.

01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:32.501
Ride at once. Both of you.

01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:35.045
I will take the rest of your family
back with me to Rosings.

01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:37.589
There's no safer place in England.

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.300
Collect your people.

01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:48.558
The bridge is closed!

01:18:48.642 --> 01:18:50.477
It's too dangerous to cross.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.229
All of London's fallen to the zombies.

01:18:52.312 --> 01:18:53.605
We have urgent business on the other side.

01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:56.566
This bridge is rigged
with all the explosives left in England.

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:58.235
It's to be detonated tomorrow at dawn

01:18:58.318 --> 01:19:00.237
when the last squadron
withdraw from The In-Between.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.322
Our boys can't hold them much longer.

01:19:02.406 --> 01:19:06.785
If the undead of London take the bridge, well,
the rest of England will surely be lost.

01:19:07.035 --> 01:19:09.413
Nevertheless, we must cross over.

01:19:26.096 --> 01:19:29.099
Zombie protocol is in effect!

01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:34.438
One, seek out and destroy
any remaining undead.

01:19:35.856 --> 01:19:39.943
Two, any of the fallen with intact skulls

01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:43.738
must have their brains
perforated or crushed

01:19:44.698 --> 01:19:48.243
to ensure they do not rise again
as the undead!

01:20:03.925 --> 01:20:06.344
Bloody hell... Fie, damnable scarf!

01:20:24.404 --> 01:20:25.947
Hello, Miss Bennet.

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.063
Potter's field.

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:00.482
Yes. Quite.

01:21:01.441 --> 01:21:02.442
Pardon?

01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:06.071
This. What we're standing on,

01:21:06.154 --> 01:21:07.656
it's an unmarked zombie graveyard.

01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:10.617
Yes. Of course.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.961
<i>Miss Bennet, what possible cause
could the two of you have</i>

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:24.839
for leaving Hertfordshire
and entering into The In-Between?

01:21:26.216 --> 01:21:29.219
If adventures will not befall
a young lady in her own village,

01:21:29.302 --> 01:21:31.346
she must seek them abroad.

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:36.726
We had no choice.

01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:39.980
Wickham has run off with Lydia.

01:21:40.564 --> 01:21:43.191
He has taken her to where his
"zombie aristocrats" congregate.

01:21:44.818 --> 01:21:46.194
St. Lazarus.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.078
St. Lazarus?

01:21:56.871 --> 01:21:58.415
I know it well.

01:22:01.001 --> 01:22:04.004
I saw it razed to the ground five days ago.

01:22:05.505 --> 01:22:08.425
Your sister couldn't
possibly have survived.

01:22:12.679 --> 01:22:15.181
I'm profoundly sorry for your loss.

01:22:16.016 --> 01:22:17.767
Colonel Darcy.

01:22:18.226 --> 01:22:20.687
We need you at the command tent.

01:22:23.064 --> 01:22:26.359
I fear I must depart
for Hingham Bridge immediately.

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:29.321
Of course.

01:22:47.714 --> 01:22:51.593
Let's see how reasonable his aristocrats
are after their appetites have been whet.

01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:53.303
On my mark.

01:22:53.386 --> 01:22:54.512
Now.

01:22:56.681 --> 01:22:58.808
Dawn breaks at 5:00 tomorrow.

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:02.062
I'll make it back.

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:04.356
Of course you will, old man.

01:23:04.439 --> 01:23:07.192
The order must be given at first light.

01:23:07.275 --> 01:23:09.069
No matter what.

01:23:09.152 --> 01:23:10.904
I'll give the order.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:07.711
<i>I fear I should not have confided in Darcy.</i>

01:24:07.794 --> 01:24:12.048
Fear the hordes of ravenous unmentionables
that are swarming our way.

01:24:13.675 --> 01:24:18.096
Liz, London has already fallen
and the Grand Barrier burns as we speak.

01:24:25.186 --> 01:24:27.313
Hingham Bridge is behind us.

01:24:28.106 --> 01:24:29.858
London's over there.

01:24:30.942 --> 01:24:34.112
Which direction
are you looking in, Mr. Bingley?

01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:36.698
St. Lazarus?

01:24:38.408 --> 01:24:40.660
- Darcy lied...
- To spare you.

01:24:40.744 --> 01:24:42.746
He'd risk anything for you, Miss Bennet.

01:24:42.829 --> 01:24:44.205
Lizzy!

01:24:44.289 --> 01:24:45.331
Lizzy!

01:24:49.461 --> 01:24:51.880
Don't hang about.

01:24:51.963 --> 01:24:53.131
Go on.

01:24:55.633 --> 01:24:57.677
Zombies wouldn't do that.

01:24:58.595 --> 01:24:59.929
Oh, my. Aye.

01:25:00.013 --> 01:25:03.183
Who would steal the
brains of dead soldiers?

01:25:03.767 --> 01:25:08.021
Almighty Lazarus,
to whom all souls are opened.

01:25:08.104 --> 01:25:13.151
Breathe life into our hearts,
by the insertion of your divine spirit.

01:25:16.029 --> 01:25:18.782
"I am the resurrection and the life.

01:25:18.865 --> 01:25:21.034
"He that believeth in me..."

01:26:05.203 --> 01:26:07.080
- Mr. Darcy...
- It's all right.

01:26:09.541 --> 01:26:13.503
He said you'd come.
Wickham said you'd come.

01:26:13.586 --> 01:26:15.338
Mr. Darcy...

01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:33.606
The bastard.

01:26:35.108 --> 01:26:37.777
My God, you're so predictable.

01:26:37.861 --> 01:26:41.865
I knew by taking young Lydia,
you'd have to protect the Bennets' honor.

01:26:41.948 --> 01:26:44.450
So, come to kill me then, Fitz?

01:26:44.534 --> 01:26:48.621
On the contrary,
I've come to make you an offer.

01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:57.589
The Bennets have authorized me
to offer you a commission of Â£10,000

01:26:57.672 --> 01:27:00.633
to return Lydia and leave England for good.

01:27:00.717 --> 01:27:02.760
How very noble of you to deliver
the Bennets' offer, Fitz,

01:27:02.844 --> 01:27:04.554
but I'm afraid my answer is no.

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:08.391
And is there no financial inducement

01:27:08.474 --> 01:27:10.977
that could convince you
to do the honorable thing, George?

01:27:12.103 --> 01:27:13.187
None.

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:16.357
You see, money is of no use to me now.

01:27:20.695 --> 01:27:22.030
Is that your father's watch?

01:27:23.448 --> 01:27:24.490
Yes.

01:27:25.158 --> 01:27:26.993
Give it to me.

01:27:33.583 --> 01:27:34.626
No.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.219
Bloody hell!

01:27:52.352 --> 01:27:53.561
Brains!

01:27:55.605 --> 01:27:57.315
Mr. Darcy, please!

01:28:16.042 --> 01:28:17.835
What have you done, Darcy?

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:20.463
I fed them!

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:21.965
Godspeed, Georgie.

01:28:42.694 --> 01:28:46.406
All of you, go to the bridge!
Now! Go to the bridge!

01:28:46.489 --> 01:28:49.492
Lydia, listen to me.
You have to get across Hingham Bridge.

01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:50.910
But, Mr. Darcy, you have to come.

01:28:50.994 --> 01:28:53.955
As long as Wickham lives,
England is in peril. Go, Lydia. Go!

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.592
All of you, Hingham Bridge!

01:29:06.676 --> 01:29:09.012
I conquered London, Darcy.

01:29:09.095 --> 01:29:11.305
Did you really think you could defeat me?

01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:12.807
I always have.

01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:32.994
You're a traitor, George.

01:29:33.077 --> 01:29:35.955
No, Fitz. I'm a king!

01:29:51.262 --> 01:29:52.513
My God.

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:02.982
Lydia!

01:30:03.483 --> 01:30:04.484
Lydia!

01:30:34.013 --> 01:30:35.014
It's time, sir.

01:30:42.605 --> 01:30:43.898
So it is.

01:30:52.907 --> 01:30:54.826
- Rider!
- Wait!

01:31:01.124 --> 01:31:04.752
Lydia, where are the others?

01:31:46.252 --> 01:31:49.005
You fool. I've been one of them all along.

01:31:49.088 --> 01:31:53.009
If I had the living your father intended me,
I never would have been in the army,

01:31:53.092 --> 01:31:54.594
I never would have been infected.

01:31:54.677 --> 01:31:56.846
This is your doing, Darcy!

01:31:56.929 --> 01:31:59.015
Suppressing my hunger was easy.

01:31:59.098 --> 01:32:02.268
They needed God,
I had my hatred of you to sustain me.

01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:05.021
The Four Horsemen have risen from Hell!

01:32:05.104 --> 01:32:07.106
The zombie apocalypse is here.

01:32:07.231 --> 01:32:09.483
I am the one
the undead have been waiting for.

01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:11.110
The one to lead them.

01:32:11.194 --> 01:32:14.113
Every life I take, every atrocity I commit,

01:32:14.197 --> 01:32:15.281
is on your head!

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:30.129
Keep your eyes peeled, lads!

01:32:31.005 --> 01:32:33.216
- We can't delay any longer, sir.
- No!

01:32:33.299 --> 01:32:36.260
The undead will have reached the bridge
soon, and then it will be too late.

01:32:36.344 --> 01:32:38.512
They're not back yet!
You must wait, Bingley!

01:32:39.972 --> 01:32:41.724
Detonate the bridge.

01:32:42.308 --> 01:32:44.227
Give the order. Give the order.

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:45.978
Yes, sir.

01:32:56.906 --> 01:32:58.574
Four!

01:32:58.658 --> 01:32:59.659
Three!

01:32:59.742 --> 01:33:00.910
Two!

01:33:01.661 --> 01:33:02.703
One!

01:33:04.205 --> 01:33:05.206
Liz!

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:15.508
Liz!

01:34:33.753 --> 01:34:34.920
Mr. Darcy.

01:34:59.403 --> 01:35:01.906
The very first moment I beheld you,

01:35:03.449 --> 01:35:06.577
my heart was irrevocably gone.

01:35:58.087 --> 01:35:59.213
<i>Raise the gates!</i>

01:36:14.145 --> 01:36:18.732
Lady Catherine, might I take this opportunity
to compliment you on your pantaloons?

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:25.573
And your eye patch. It's very fetching.
Is it function or fashion?

01:36:25.656 --> 01:36:27.867
Function.

01:36:30.369 --> 01:36:31.745
Your Ladyship.

01:36:33.038 --> 01:36:35.082
Guess who's speaking with Papa
in the library? It's...

01:36:35.166 --> 01:36:36.333
Mr. Bingley.

01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:41.172
Lady Catherine.

01:36:47.595 --> 01:36:50.306
Well, this is all rather embarrassing,

01:36:50.389 --> 01:36:54.059
but I would like to request
the privilege of speaking with Miss Jane.

01:36:54.935 --> 01:36:56.103
Alone.

01:37:08.782 --> 01:37:09.909
Mr. Darcy.

01:37:12.703 --> 01:37:15.664
My favorite nephew,
you lay unconscious for so long,

01:37:15.748 --> 01:37:19.293
that when we'd heard you'd risen, we'd
feared you'd joined the ranks of the undead.

01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:22.213
Any word from the Canal?

01:37:22.296 --> 01:37:24.256
It's holding for the time being.

01:37:26.091 --> 01:37:27.134
Yes!

01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:28.886
Jane said yes.

01:37:28.969 --> 01:37:30.012
Would you excuse me?

01:37:30.095 --> 01:37:31.764
Quick! Quick, quick!

01:37:33.474 --> 01:37:35.392
This is so exciting!

01:37:36.977 --> 01:37:38.020
Jane!

01:37:38.103 --> 01:37:40.064
Keep going! Hurry up, Lydia!

01:37:46.987 --> 01:37:48.364
Miss Bennet.

01:37:51.158 --> 01:37:52.243
Mr. Darcy.

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.705
You look as though you're fully mended.

01:37:57.331 --> 01:37:59.458
I am. Thank you.

01:38:00.167 --> 01:38:03.212
If it wasn't for you,
I'd have surely perished.

01:38:03.295 --> 01:38:06.006
You have saved me in more ways than one.

01:38:07.967 --> 01:38:10.678
What you said to me on Hingham Bridge...

01:38:13.055 --> 01:38:14.515
You heard me?

01:38:15.683 --> 01:38:16.850
I did.

01:38:18.477 --> 01:38:20.062
It gave me hope.

01:38:20.896 --> 01:38:22.147
Of what?

01:38:22.898 --> 01:38:25.985
That your feelings towards me
may have changed.

01:38:28.195 --> 01:38:32.491
However, one word from you now
will silence me on the subject forever.

01:38:54.096 --> 01:38:57.099
You are the love of my life,
Elizabeth Bennet.

01:39:00.644 --> 01:39:07.234
So I ask you now,
half in anguish, half in hope,

01:39:10.654 --> 01:39:17.077
will you do me the great, great honor
of taking me for your husband?

01:39:22.374 --> 01:39:23.459
Yes.

01:39:26.003 --> 01:39:27.046
Yes.

01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:46.482
<i>Dearly beloved,</i>

01:39:46.565 --> 01:39:50.319
<i>we are gathered here today
in the sight of God</i>

01:39:50.402 --> 01:39:54.073
to join together this man and this woman,

01:39:56.075 --> 01:39:59.370
and this man and this woman,

01:39:59.453 --> 01:40:01.121
in holy matrimony.

01:40:02.331 --> 01:40:05.959
I now pronounce you man and wife,

01:40:07.378 --> 01:40:09.922
and man and wife.

01:40:11.507 --> 01:40:15.511
You may now kiss, Mr. Darcy...
The brides.

01:40:16.929 --> 01:40:18.639
You may now kiss the brides.

01:40:46.667 --> 01:40:48.752
Thank you. Thank you.

01:40:48.836 --> 01:40:50.921
Thank you for coming.

01:40:54.633 --> 01:40:56.009
I'm so happy!

01:46:43.565 --> 01:46:45.859

<i>We all fall down</i>

<i>Another, then, another</i>

01:47:00.665 --> 01:47:02.542
<i>They all rise up</i>
