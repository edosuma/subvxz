WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:02.105
<i>Previously on House of lies...</i>

00:02.106 --> 00:03.828
So, you and Doug met
on a dating web site?

00:03.828 --> 00:06.119
They're a great way to
weed out douche bags.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.832
I feel like, um... we're really
dancing around each other.

00:09.833 --> 00:11.577
Let it remain really awkward.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.433
What do you want, man?
Why are you here?

00:13.434 --> 00:15.554
Dad was in a pretty bad
car accident two weeks ago.

00:15.555 --> 00:17.541
You told Kevin
we're sleeping together?

00:17.542 --> 00:18.960
What are we doing?

00:18.961 --> 00:20.504
I'm out.

00:20.505 --> 00:22.657
I'm gonna start my own shop.

00:22.658 --> 00:26.562
We are promoting our very own
Jeannie Van Der hooven.

00:26.563 --> 00:28.913
Management... that doesn't
even mean anything. What?

00:28.914 --> 00:30.830
Leave right now. Spend the
rest of the afternoon with me.

00:32.412 --> 00:34.862
Did the dildo king
find his dildo queen?

00:34.863 --> 00:36.411
I mean, I-I like him.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.886
Cool.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.666
<i>Marty, Marty, they're
demolishing public housing</i>

00:47.667 --> 00:51.089
to make room
for a goddamn Wal-Mart,

00:51.090 --> 00:52.337
with their outsourced,

00:52.338 --> 00:54.959
sweatshop-made,
faux-Christian bullshit,

00:54.960 --> 00:57.272
selling it to the people
and the public like it's...

00:57.273 --> 00:59.859
Economic growth.
Hypocrites.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.333
Right. And meanwhile,

01:01.334 --> 01:03.512
the people who are most in need
of the jobs this creates

01:03.513 --> 01:05.862
get shipped 20, 30 Miles away.

01:05.863 --> 01:07.836
Marty, even you can see
how fucked-up this shit is, man.

01:07.837 --> 01:08.981
Hey, Malcolm, man.

01:08.982 --> 01:10.788
All right, all right,
my bad, lil' man.

01:10.789 --> 01:12.800
My passion gets the better
of me sometimes.

01:12.801 --> 01:14.512
It's cool. Call it
as you see it.

01:14.513 --> 01:16.123
Do you know what else
would be cool?

01:16.124 --> 01:17.329
If we could play some cards.

01:17.330 --> 01:18.802
You know, squirrel,
I got to say

01:18.803 --> 01:20.548
that I'm a little stumped,
you know,

01:20.549 --> 01:23.331
at the fact that you're taking
the city's side.

01:23.332 --> 01:24.337
Especially after

01:24.338 --> 01:25.810
all the shit they did to you.

01:25.811 --> 01:28.694
I'm not taking
the city's side, okay?

01:28.695 --> 01:30.905
Well, you know what? Not taking
a side is taking a side.

01:30.906 --> 01:32.549
You are a bottomless pit

01:32.550 --> 01:33.788
of lame clichÃ©s.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.932
What, you fist-bumping him
on that?

01:35.933 --> 01:37.776
You know what?

01:37.777 --> 01:39.053
Twenty-five.

01:40.359 --> 01:41.964
I fold.

01:41.965 --> 01:43.908
Yeah, man, who's
shuffling these cards?

01:43.909 --> 01:45.418
All right, youngster,

01:45.419 --> 01:48.132
looks like it's just
me and you. Heads up.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.671
Let's go. Pay to play, baby.

01:49.672 --> 01:51.381
Why can't we bet
with real money?

01:51.382 --> 01:54.329
Because somebody at the table
doesn't have any... real money.

01:54.330 --> 01:55.367
Har har har.

01:56.673 --> 01:58.011
Should I call?

01:58.012 --> 02:00.054
Well, look, you got
to work it through.

02:00.055 --> 02:01.362
Now, your Uncle just raised,

02:01.363 --> 02:03.105
so maybe he has a good
hand, maybe he doesn't.

02:03.106 --> 02:05.114
What's important
is he's got a big-ass stack,

02:05.115 --> 02:08.127
and he's leveraging
it against your stack

02:08.128 --> 02:10.638
and he's also in position,
and that's what you want to be

02:10.639 --> 02:12.480
in any good negotiation.
Remember that.

02:12.481 --> 02:13.952
It's how the rich get richer.

02:13.953 --> 02:15.861
Always at the expense
of the little guy.

02:15.862 --> 02:17.402
Right, Marty?

02:17.403 --> 02:19.411
Remember that, too.

02:19.412 --> 02:21.253
So should I call or not?

02:21.254 --> 02:22.491
It's up to you.

02:22.492 --> 02:23.930
Totally up to you.

02:26.543 --> 02:27.947
Oh!

02:27.948 --> 02:29.889
He said he ain't scared.
Ooh.

02:29.890 --> 02:31.530
He ain't gonna get bullied.
Okay.

02:31.531 --> 02:33.671
I like that.
I like that, lil' man.

02:33.672 --> 02:35.313
Okay, all right.

02:35.314 --> 02:37.184
All right.
Game on.

02:37.185 --> 02:38.592
What about you, big squirrel?

02:38.593 --> 02:40.333
You interested in contributing

02:40.334 --> 02:41.972
some of your big stack
to the cause?

02:41.973 --> 02:43.713
Oh, you want some pretzels?
You can have all the pretzels.

02:43.714 --> 02:45.454
No, no, I'm talking
about the real money.

02:45.455 --> 02:48.029
Oh, oh, the real money.
No, no, no, no, no. Yes.

02:48.030 --> 02:50.273
Ah... I'm in.
Like I thought.

02:50.274 --> 02:51.277
Pop.
No, dad,

02:51.278 --> 02:52.815
there's no way yeah, I'm in.

02:52.816 --> 02:54.052
I'm taking money from you.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.990 --> 03:05.992
I'm going all in.

03:07.594 --> 03:09.928
I'm not gonna let
Uncle Malcolm out-leverage...

03:09.929 --> 03:11.429
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

03:11.430 --> 03:13.164
Uh, you should fold.

03:13.165 --> 03:16.333
Because your Uncle is the
king of the slow play.

03:16.334 --> 03:19.102
It's what he does... he draws
you all the way down the river,

03:19.103 --> 03:21.303
and then he sucks you dry.

03:21.304 --> 03:22.804
Look at that.

03:22.805 --> 03:25.206
That's a full house.
That's dirty.

03:25.207 --> 03:27.407
Pay up, baby.
Just take your pretzels.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.808
So, I get these tickets, right?

03:30.809 --> 03:32.810
Fucking floor seats.
Amazing tickets.

03:32.811 --> 03:34.845
The kind of tickets you
would kill your mom for.

03:34.846 --> 03:37.081
I think that says more about
my relationship with my mother

03:37.082 --> 03:38.282
than the quality
of the tickets,

03:38.283 --> 03:40.284
but go ahead.
So I call Marty to offer him up

03:40.285 --> 03:42.952
the other ticket,
but he never gets back to me.

03:42.953 --> 03:44.721
He doesn't call me back,
he doesn't text me.

03:44.722 --> 03:48.292
I have no idea what
the fuck is... what?

03:48.293 --> 03:50.060
I always thought
that smug arrogance

03:50.061 --> 03:51.527
was your most off-putting
quality.

03:51.528 --> 03:54.197
I had no idea
it was tween girl insecurity.

03:54.198 --> 03:57.838
Fuck off. There's the
Clyde I'm comfortable with.

03:57.839 --> 04:00.378
I don't come across
as insecure, do I?

04:00.379 --> 04:01.379
Yeah, hey,

04:01.380 --> 04:02.814
Marty, it's me. Again.

04:02.815 --> 04:04.215
Uh, Doug.

04:04.216 --> 04:05.783
Uh, I need to talk to
you about something.

04:05.784 --> 04:06.817
Kind of important, actually,

04:06.818 --> 04:08.318
so can you call me
back when you, uh...

04:08.319 --> 04:09.319
When you get a second?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.520
Please, I'm begging you.

04:10.521 --> 04:11.821
Uh, it's Doug guggenheim.

04:11.822 --> 04:13.155
All right, bye.

04:13.156 --> 04:15.590
God.

04:15.591 --> 04:19.024
Hey, has Marty seemed a little
distracted to you guys lately?

04:19.026 --> 04:21.594
Even fucking Doug agrees with me. Yeah.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.229
Even Doug agrees with you.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.563
God, I know. It's weird.
I've called him, like,

04:25.564 --> 04:28.432
five times today, and he always
calls me back. Always.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.100
You know? Even if
it's just to say,

04:30.101 --> 04:32.836
"yo, Doug, quit blowin' up
What?

04:32.837 --> 04:34.605
Don't.

04:34.606 --> 04:36.673
I'm sorry. Please don't tell
No.

04:36.674 --> 04:38.108
Do you have any idea
how racist that is?

04:38.109 --> 04:40.409
We're gonna have to tell him.
We have no choice.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.677
No. No, I'm not
an impressions guy.

04:41.678 --> 04:43.178
I'm just worried if he's okay.

04:43.179 --> 04:44.312
Should we be calling hospitals?

04:44.313 --> 04:45.880
I didn't want
to have to do this,

04:45.881 --> 04:47.214
but you leave me no choice.

04:47.215 --> 04:50.250
Hey, I'm heading into a thing.
What's up?

04:50.251 --> 04:52.417
Sorry. I butt-dialed you.
Oh.

04:52.418 --> 04:53.951
No, don't hang up.
Oh, shit.

04:53.952 --> 04:55.419
Hang on.
All right.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.354
We got him. We got him now.

04:57.355 --> 04:58.922
He is alive.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.256
We know that.

05:01.658 --> 05:03.860
Voice mail again.
Are you kidding me?

05:06.631 --> 05:08.631
Damn.

05:08.632 --> 05:10.633
It is fucking hot in here.

05:12.736 --> 05:14.736
So, what do you think?

05:14.737 --> 05:17.038
Well...

05:17.039 --> 05:19.039
What I think is,

05:19.040 --> 05:23.776
you're asking me to leave one
of the top firms in the country

05:23.777 --> 05:26.412
to follow you to some
rinky-dink start-up.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.747
That's what I think.

05:27.748 --> 05:29.447
Eric, come on.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.645
We've been in this game a
long time. You could see this.

05:31.646 --> 05:33.875
Galweather stearn's a
sinking ship. And what?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.575
You're the lifeboat?

05:35.576 --> 05:37.443
I'm the fucking coast guard.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.581
I'm just

05:43.582 --> 05:45.716
messing with you, Marty.
Why would you do that?

05:45.717 --> 05:48.251
Come on, man.
Hey, look, you're my guy,

05:48.252 --> 05:49.419
so of course I'm in.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.221
Great. Now,
look, no one...

05:52.222 --> 05:53.623
No one can know.

05:53.624 --> 05:54.991
What?
You think this is

05:54.992 --> 05:55.991
my first exodus
or something, man?

05:55.992 --> 05:57.993
Nah, you're a champ.

05:57.994 --> 05:59.893
Hey. Come here.

05:59.894 --> 06:02.059
Oh, let's just shake on it.
Nah,

06:02.060 --> 06:03.755
come here, you.

06:03.756 --> 06:06.450
Marty kaan and associates.
Yeah. Goddamn,

06:06.451 --> 06:09.418
that's exciting, man.
Ooh. Yeah.

06:09.419 --> 06:10.986
You, um, wanted to...

06:10.987 --> 06:12.921
Has Marty
finished his projections

06:12.922 --> 06:15.823
of practice growth and sources
quarterly report yet?

06:15.824 --> 06:18.392
See me?

06:18.393 --> 06:21.161
It was due yesterday.

06:21.162 --> 06:26.730
Those deadlines have always
been, um, more like suggestions.

06:26.731 --> 06:28.965
Well, now they're a deadline.

06:28.966 --> 06:30.833
Understood. I will let him know.

06:30.834 --> 06:32.869
Great.

06:34.838 --> 06:36.072
So, um...

06:36.938 --> 06:39.170
where is Marty, anyway?

06:39.171 --> 06:42.337
He is meeting with a
prospective client. Oh.

06:42.338 --> 06:45.007
Well... that's
very exciting.

06:45.008 --> 06:47.142
Mm-hmm.
Huh.

06:50.345 --> 06:51.946
You know, Jeannie,

06:51.947 --> 06:53.914
I have, um, been
giving an awful lot

06:53.915 --> 06:56.916
of thought to the future
of this company.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.918
To the, um, kind of people

06:58.919 --> 07:01.955
that I would like to see
leading us. People like you.

07:01.956 --> 07:06.460
Are you about to give me another
promotion that changes nothing?

07:07.495 --> 07:08.796
Fair enough.

07:10.031 --> 07:11.798
Yeah.
Actually,

07:11.799 --> 07:15.101
I was thinking that it was time
for you to run your own pod.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.370
Official offer is going to be

07:17.371 --> 07:20.373
on your desk by end of day.

07:20.374 --> 07:24.610
So what do you say, Jeannie?

07:24.611 --> 07:27.346
Are you ready to step up?

07:30.984 --> 07:34.787
Hey! Marty. Hey.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.522
Hey.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.491
It's "phoh."

07:39.492 --> 07:43.027
Do you like "phoh"?

07:43.028 --> 07:44.295
I love "phoh."

07:44.296 --> 07:46.396
"Phoh" is my bro.

07:46.397 --> 07:47.697
"Phoh" sho.

07:47.698 --> 07:51.401
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

07:51.402 --> 07:54.138
Actually think it's
pronounced "phah." Is it?

07:54.139 --> 07:55.840
Yeah.
Oh. Well.

07:55.841 --> 07:58.508
Then, um, pho... Ck me.

08:01.545 --> 08:03.812
So, you don't remember me,
is what I'm... I do not.

08:03.813 --> 08:05.580
Okay.

08:05.581 --> 08:06.848
I mean, did we, uh...

08:06.849 --> 08:08.183
I'm Doug's girlfriend.

08:08.184 --> 08:09.784
Oh.
I'm Doug's girlfriend.

08:09.785 --> 08:11.519
We met at the retreat.
The retreat.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.921
That's right.
Right.

08:14.757 --> 08:17.425
Made Doug come like a foghorn. Well...

08:17.426 --> 08:20.328
That's private.

08:20.329 --> 08:22.197
See you.

08:22.198 --> 08:24.199
Yep, real pleasure.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.334
How'd it go
with steam bath Willie?

08:26.335 --> 08:28.837
He showed me his business,
we made a deal.

08:28.838 --> 08:31.206
Wow. Hope those two
weren't mutually exclusive.

08:31.207 --> 08:34.408
Does that give, uh, us
enough money to make the move?

08:34.409 --> 08:36.409
No. I mean, not if we...

08:36.410 --> 08:38.212
Not if we want to do it right.

08:38.212 --> 08:40.948
You got to make
a list, okay? Your people.

08:40.948 --> 08:42.683
People that we can poach,
but, you know,

08:42.683 --> 08:44.951
people that can also keep
their mouths shut. Okay.

08:44.952 --> 08:46.753
Um, yeah, I'll start
to reach out.

08:46.754 --> 08:48.388
No, no. Don't-don't reach out.

08:48.389 --> 08:50.023
No, just-just make a list.

08:51.058 --> 08:53.126
Okay.

08:53.127 --> 08:56.463
Uh, julianne is looking
for your ppgs's. Oh, fuck.

08:56.464 --> 08:58.865
I-I don't have time to deal
with that bullshit paperwork.

08:58.866 --> 09:01.034
Jeannie, please,
can you just do it for me?

09:01.035 --> 09:03.601
Okay.
Thank you.

09:03.602 --> 09:06.131
Something else?

09:06.132 --> 09:07.229
Yes, actually.

09:07.230 --> 09:09.719
Julianne has offered
me my own pod.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.782
I thought you
were coming with me.

09:13.783 --> 09:15.414
I am.

09:15.415 --> 09:16.681
So, what, then?
What does... what does...

09:16.682 --> 09:18.047
What does it matter?

09:18.048 --> 09:19.579
I don't know. It's just a
nice vote of confidence.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.777
I'm just... it's...
It's nice to feel

09:21.778 --> 09:23.177
that your hard work
is appreciated.

09:23.178 --> 09:24.341
I'm just sharing.

09:24.342 --> 09:26.539
Uh-huh. You hedging?

09:27.740 --> 09:29.706
Jea... look, Jeannie, if you...

09:29.707 --> 09:31.775
If... if you think
that you're better off...

09:31.776 --> 09:33.076
I'm not hedging.

09:33.077 --> 09:34.578
Staying here, then...

09:36.179 --> 09:38.841
Okay.

09:41.841 --> 09:45.437
I swear to God,
if this fucking asshole Doug

09:45.438 --> 09:47.036
calls me one more time,
Jeannie...

09:47.037 --> 09:48.868
Oh, I got to answer
for Doug now?

09:50.434 --> 09:54.330
He and Clyde have been asking
a lot of questions, Marty.

09:54.331 --> 09:55.329
You have to...
Just make the...

09:56.663 --> 09:59.495
Just make the list, please,

09:59.496 --> 10:01.264
and take care
of whatever bullshit it is

10:01.265 --> 10:02.833
that julianne needs.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.137
I got to go look
at some office spaces, okay?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.372
Okay.
Um, I-I'll run by

10:06.373 --> 10:08.437
and talk to the
idiot before I go.

10:08.438 --> 10:10.836
Oh, shit.

10:10.837 --> 10:13.134
Hey, there you are.

10:13.135 --> 10:14.933
Hey, Marty, uh, guess who.

10:14.934 --> 10:16.463
Yeah, it's me again.

10:16.464 --> 10:17.896
So I don't know where you are,

10:17.897 --> 10:19.328
but, uh, call me when...
He's here.

10:19.329 --> 10:20.527
He is here.

10:20.528 --> 10:23.524
Who? Marty is here?
Mm-hmm, yes.

10:23.525 --> 10:25.423
Oh, I guess you're here.
That's great.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.823
Okay, well, you know what?
I'm gonna swing by.

10:26.824 --> 10:28.056
I got to talk to you
about something.

10:28.057 --> 10:29.420
I'll see you soon. Bye.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.686
Doug.
Yeah.

10:30.687 --> 10:32.383
What is the big emergency?

10:32.384 --> 10:36.215
Oh, uh, a friend of mine
from hbs put me in touch

10:36.216 --> 10:37.716
with the ceo of tracer,

10:37.717 --> 10:40.448
this heat-seeking software
company in the bay area.

10:40.449 --> 10:43.438
Okay. He's looking for a
possible expansion consult.

10:43.439 --> 10:44.503
He wants to sit down with me,

10:44.504 --> 10:46.200
so I got to get
the big guy up to speed.

10:46.201 --> 10:48.932
Okay, hold on, he wants
to sit down with you.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.864
Yeah. So why do you need Marty?

10:50.865 --> 10:52.629
Well, it's a potentially
huge client for us,

10:52.630 --> 10:54.327
and, uh, you know,
Marty's a closer.

10:54.328 --> 10:55.627
You know, it's
a no-brainer.

10:55.628 --> 10:58.025
Well, Doug, when are you going
to stop letting other people

10:58.026 --> 11:00.656
take the credit for all
of your hard work?

11:00.657 --> 11:02.788
What? Is that what you think?

11:02.789 --> 11:03.887
Pretty simple question.

11:03.888 --> 11:05.385
Yeah... no, but
it's not like that.

11:05.386 --> 11:07.717
No, we're a team, you know.
Okay, mm-hmm.

11:07.718 --> 11:09.982
We work together. It's easy.
Okay, so if Marty signs this guy,

11:09.983 --> 11:13.812
is it a win for the team or
is it really a win for Marty?

11:13.813 --> 11:15.510
These are your contacts,

11:15.511 --> 11:18.009
you did all the prep work,
so go out there

11:18.010 --> 11:20.373
and take what's yours.

11:20.374 --> 11:23.172
Doug, why don't you quit
blowing up my phone?

11:23.173 --> 11:24.171
What is it?

11:24.172 --> 11:26.403
Um...

11:26.404 --> 11:29.200
Uh... nothing.

11:29.201 --> 11:30.933
No, I...
Nothing? Really?

11:30.934 --> 11:32.196
It was something...
But never mind.

11:32.197 --> 11:34.460
I googled it, and I
was able to... I'm out.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.891
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

11:35.892 --> 11:38.115
You know the last
time that we saw each other?

11:38.116 --> 11:41.345
Uh, oh, my God, it was
the night after graduation

11:41.346 --> 11:42.945
when we did all that ecstacy.

11:42.946 --> 11:43.945
Remember that?
Fucking seriously?

11:43.946 --> 11:45.076
Not really.

11:45.077 --> 11:46.776
Oh, yeah, it's probably
for the best.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.206
Probably.

11:49.207 --> 11:51.938
God, Monica, I love
when you hang out over here.

11:51.939 --> 11:53.436
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

11:53.437 --> 11:55.434
Are you fucking s...?

11:55.435 --> 11:57.099
I'm Clyde oberholt.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.165
Top 25 under 30, huh?

11:58.166 --> 12:00.731
Hey, Monica.
Hi. How are you?

12:00.732 --> 12:01.829
What are you doing here?

12:01.830 --> 12:03.056
I don't know.
I was in the neighborhood,

12:03.057 --> 12:04.420
and I-I realized

12:04.421 --> 12:05.951
I hadn't welcomed Tamara
back to the workforce.

12:05.952 --> 12:07.717
Oh.
Welcome.

12:07.718 --> 12:08.717
Thank you.
Oh, really?

12:08.718 --> 12:09.816
That's surprising

12:09.817 --> 12:11.047
because, back in "b" school,

12:11.048 --> 12:12.979
I'm pretty sure you
guys hated each other.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.812
We did not.
We were just competitive.

12:15.813 --> 12:17.911
Oh, and you were the
girl that just partied

12:17.912 --> 12:20.474
all night, slept
through microeconomics

12:20.475 --> 12:21.972
and still aced those exams.

12:21.973 --> 12:23.072
I kind of fucking hated you.

12:24.072 --> 12:26.336
Guilty.

12:26.337 --> 12:28.601
Well, I'm still taking
you to lunch. Okay.

12:28.602 --> 12:30.466
Oh, what's this?
That's weird.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.197
Oh, okay, why don't
we check it out?

12:32.198 --> 12:34.196
2012 top 25 under 30.

12:34.197 --> 12:35.429
And who's that gentleman?

12:35.430 --> 12:37.527
I don't know, olive complexion,
really Jewish.

12:37.528 --> 12:38.526
Clyde oberholt.

12:38.527 --> 12:39.759
Number 25.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.758
That's a good job.

12:40.759 --> 12:41.857
It's way down the list.

12:41.858 --> 12:43.087
It's not in a specific order.

12:43.088 --> 12:45.285
So, shall we? Uh, yeah. Why don't we?

12:45.286 --> 12:46.384
Oh, you're gonna join us.

12:46.385 --> 12:47.382
Okay.
Are you sure you have time?

12:47.383 --> 12:48.414
Got nothing but time.

12:48.415 --> 12:50.011
And who loves
a trip down memory Lane

12:50.012 --> 12:51.408
more than Marty kaan?

12:51.409 --> 12:53.034
Literally everyone.

12:53.035 --> 12:54.397
Oh, and what do we have here?

12:54.398 --> 12:56.491
"Clyde oberholt is a force
to be reckoned with

12:56.492 --> 12:58.819
in business and in life."
Hot.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.179
Am I coming with you
guys to lunch? You're not.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.007
I'll make a sandwich.

13:02.008 --> 13:03.538
Mmm.

13:03.539 --> 13:05.169
Monica, what...
What are we doing here?

13:05.170 --> 13:06.868
I mean, what...
What-what-what's going on?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.201
What? What do you mean?

13:08.202 --> 13:10.498
Come on, this bullshit,
th-th-the casual lunch,

13:10.499 --> 13:11.858
the waxing nostalgic

13:11.859 --> 13:13.688
about the good old days.
Come on.

13:13.689 --> 13:15.647
You're right... I do.

13:15.648 --> 13:18.203
I have an ulterior motive for
inviting Tamara to lunch today.

13:18.204 --> 13:19.433
Of course you do.

13:19.434 --> 13:20.926
I was on Facebook
the other night.

13:20.927 --> 13:23.320
Sometimes I like to go on there,
see how fat people are getting.

13:24.684 --> 13:27.174
One guy that's looking just
fine, though, is your husband,

13:27.175 --> 13:30.392
but I was really
sad when I saw that

13:30.393 --> 13:33.414
his relationship status
changed to "it's complicated."

13:33.415 --> 13:36.201
Are you stalking Kevin
on Facebook?

13:36.202 --> 13:38.192
Uh-uh. I'm worried
about you.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.917
Oh, don't worry
about me, Monica.

13:39.918 --> 13:41.708
Your ex-husband's
been doing a...

13:41.709 --> 13:45.365
Great job helping me through
this very difficult time.

13:46.597 --> 13:49.648
Hmm, aw, that's super sweet.

13:49.649 --> 13:51.908
Hey, Monica,
the jealousy thing...

13:51.909 --> 13:53.702
Since when
have I ever been jealous

13:53.703 --> 13:55.000
of one of your fuck buddies?

13:55.001 --> 13:56.497
When, uh,

13:56.498 --> 13:58.986
you realized it might be
something more?

13:58.987 --> 14:00.714
Please, I mean,
I think we both know

14:00.715 --> 14:02.546
you're incapable
of making that happen.

14:02.547 --> 14:04.410
You know
what? Speaking of which,

14:04.411 --> 14:06.141
how is your little foray
into the...

14:07.140 --> 14:08.305
going?
Wow.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.702
Yeah, n-n-n-no,

14:09.703 --> 14:11.302
look, Monica is a lesbian now.

14:11.303 --> 14:12.535
Seriously?

14:14.366 --> 14:16.130
I think that's...
I don't want... it's done.

14:16.131 --> 14:17.694
It's done?

14:17.695 --> 14:19.692
Yeah, done, I'm done with that.
Fuck, Jesus, that was quick.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.426
I guess that explains
your headfirst dive

14:21.427 --> 14:22.957
off the vegan wagon.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.022
Well, if I learned

14:24.023 --> 14:25.489
anything from
this experience...

14:25.490 --> 14:26.686
And I'm sure you have not.

14:26.687 --> 14:28.119
It is that there
is no substitute

14:28.120 --> 14:29.751
for a good piece of meat.

14:29.752 --> 14:30.916
Ch-ch-boom!

14:30.917 --> 14:31.982
Mmm.

14:31.983 --> 14:33.481
And she's back.

14:33.482 --> 14:34.980
Let's do a toast.

14:34.981 --> 14:36.945
To Marty and Tamara.

14:36.946 --> 14:39.675
May both of you come out
of this thing unscathed.

14:39.676 --> 14:42.879
There's a first time
for everything.

14:46.813 --> 14:48.309
You got this, buddy.
You got this.

14:48.310 --> 14:49.675
Come on.

14:49.676 --> 14:51.041
Make it rain.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.438
Just make it rain.

14:52.439 --> 14:53.570
Rainmake.

14:53.571 --> 14:55.268
Just come on, fucking do it.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.834
Okay, let's make it rain.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.629
No.

15:00.630 --> 15:01.762
<i>It's a "b."</i>

15:01.763 --> 15:02.961
What? There's a "b" on the sign.

15:02.962 --> 15:04.525
A fucking "b," Sarah. Okay.

15:04.526 --> 15:06.823
Hey, calm down.
You can do this.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.554
I can't do it. I'm not meant
for the spotlight, Sarah.

15:08.555 --> 15:09.887
This is not me, all right?

15:09.888 --> 15:10.986
You're not dating prince.

15:10.987 --> 15:12.483
You're dating one of
the faceless members

15:12.484 --> 15:13.749
of the revolution.

15:13.750 --> 15:14.748
God, I'm calling Marty.

15:14.749 --> 15:16.513
No, no, you are
not calling Marty.

15:16.514 --> 15:19.042
You're gonna go in there, and
you're gonna do this yourself.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.475
No.
Get in the car.

15:20.476 --> 15:22.740
No, I have to call...
Get in the fucking car, Doug.

15:22.741 --> 15:23.738
Yeah, okay.

15:23.739 --> 15:25.736
Yeah, okay.

15:28.134 --> 15:29.366
And this brings us back
to the lobby.

15:29.367 --> 15:31.165
What'd you think?

15:31.166 --> 15:33.664
It's nice. I mean, it's
a really nice place, yeah.

15:33.665 --> 15:34.698
Well, if you're interested,

15:34.699 --> 15:36.767
I'd suggest putting in
an offer today.

15:36.768 --> 15:38.202
Today?

15:38.203 --> 15:40.067
Wow, you're just gonna
shove it right in, huh?

15:40.068 --> 15:41.800
No foreplay?

15:41.801 --> 15:43.030
Not at this orgy.

15:43.031 --> 15:44.763
I've got three competing
bids in already.

15:44.764 --> 15:46.394
Ah.
Huge players.

15:46.395 --> 15:48.659
Should I include yours?

15:51.390 --> 15:54.386
You have an IQ of 144.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.017
Yeah.

15:56.018 --> 15:59.448
You are a proud graduate of
one of the most prestigious

15:59.449 --> 16:01.681
business schools in the country. Yes.

16:01.682 --> 16:02.849
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

16:02.850 --> 16:05.516
Your regression models
are the stuff of legend.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.914
You are the wielder...
Okay.

16:08.915 --> 16:11.677
Of powerful
financial instruments.

16:11.678 --> 16:13.940
Okay, that's right. Okay, it's gonna
happen, yeah, it's gonna happen.

16:13.941 --> 16:15.172
Don't get any on my suit.

16:15.173 --> 16:17.337
I would never get any
on your beautiful head.

16:27.028 --> 16:31.922
* She never mentioned
that she's still holdin' on *

16:31.923 --> 16:35.919
* but my intuition made me feel
she's the only one... *

16:35.920 --> 16:39.049
Oh. Of course.

16:39.050 --> 16:42.447
* And goes off to the sky *

16:42.448 --> 16:46.010
<i>* off to the sky *
* off to the sky. *</i>

16:46.011 --> 16:47.876
You got to just
keep the movement going.

16:47.877 --> 16:49.109
Mm-hmm.
You know what I mean?

16:49.110 --> 16:50.944
It's really important
to just, you know,

16:50.945 --> 16:52.813
always stay the course,
stay focused with this, man.

16:52.814 --> 16:54.249
Mm-hmm.
You got it, man.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.985
Hey, what's up?

16:55.986 --> 16:56.986
Hey.

16:56.987 --> 16:58.889
Hey, dad, check this out.

16:58.890 --> 17:00.023
Uncle Malcolm...
he took me

17:00.024 --> 17:01.192
to his rally today.

17:03.497 --> 17:04.933
What they're doing
to those people

17:04.934 --> 17:06.635
in public housing
is fucked-up.

17:06.636 --> 17:08.978
Roscoe, I'm not going to tell
you again about your language.

17:08.979 --> 17:10.414
It... it is.
Knock it off.

17:10.415 --> 17:12.119
Can't you donate
something to the cause?

17:12.121 --> 17:15.363
Grandpa did, and he has
a lot less money than you.

17:15.364 --> 17:17.136
Really?

17:17.137 --> 17:19.978
Can I talk to your Uncle
alone for a second, please?

17:19.979 --> 17:22.184
Okay.

17:22.185 --> 17:25.361
You know, dad, you're either
a part of the solution...

17:25.362 --> 17:27.701
Or I'm a part of the problem, I
know... You're a part of the problem.

17:32.724 --> 17:33.859
What?

17:33.860 --> 17:35.434
What?

17:35.435 --> 17:36.571
He wanted to come down.

17:36.572 --> 17:38.046
What was I supposed
to tell him?

17:38.047 --> 17:40.354
You... you're supposed
to tell him no, Malcolm,

17:40.355 --> 17:41.995
because you're the adult
and he's a kid.

17:41.996 --> 17:44.068
I told you I don't want him
involved in this shit.

17:44.069 --> 17:47.243
You can't keep
his eyes closed forever.

17:48.581 --> 17:50.854
And what happened
to not taking pops' money?

17:50.855 --> 17:52.826
Roscoe showed him the video,
and he insisted.

17:52.827 --> 17:57.421
I wasn't gonna embarrass
him in front of your son.

18:03.366 --> 18:05.133
What are you doing?

18:06.669 --> 18:08.436
What's the number?

18:08.437 --> 18:10.871
What?

18:10.872 --> 18:13.872
Just tell me the number,
okay, Malcolm?

18:13.873 --> 18:16.174
Oh, wow.

18:16.175 --> 18:18.642
You know, don't go pretending

18:18.643 --> 18:20.375
like you don't lean on dad.

18:20.376 --> 18:21.876
He's practically

18:21.877 --> 18:23.544
raising Roscoe by himself.

18:23.545 --> 18:24.611
$5,000?

18:24.612 --> 18:25.979
Know what?
Fuck you, Marty.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.543
Okay. Uh... okay.
I'm sorry.

18:28.544 --> 18:30.374
That was an insult of an offer.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.674
$10,000.

18:33.076 --> 18:35.109
How about,
I don't want your money?

18:35.110 --> 18:37.844
Right, 'cause you're a...
A not-for-profit entity.

18:37.845 --> 18:38.944
Is that it?

18:38.945 --> 18:41.912
So, this is where
you leverage me out, huh?

18:41.913 --> 18:43.979
Just open up your
checkbook... Malcolm...

18:43.980 --> 18:45.613
And write it,
it's just that simple.

18:45.614 --> 18:49.048
Malcolm, just...
Look at me, man.

18:49.049 --> 18:50.883
Okay, our whole thing
is supposed to be about

18:50.884 --> 18:51.983
how different we are, right?

18:51.984 --> 18:53.618
We're... we're the same.

18:55.387 --> 18:57.654
That is bullshit,
and you know it.

18:57.655 --> 18:59.721
Okay, it's not.
Look, we're just...

18:59.722 --> 19:02.723
We're just working
different sides of the cash cow.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.224
I know you, because you're me.

19:06.225 --> 19:08.852
We're both just trying
to do our thing, right?

19:08.853 --> 19:12.613
So I'm gonna write this check.

19:12.614 --> 19:14.513
Maybe it's here tomorrow,

19:14.514 --> 19:16.281
maybe it's not.

19:16.282 --> 19:17.849
<i>Maybe you're here tomorrow.</i>

19:22.151 --> 19:24.585
But either way, bro,

19:24.586 --> 19:26.819
it's-it's... it's okay.

19:28.186 --> 19:30.854
Really.

19:48.363 --> 19:50.729
So I told him,
"make it about the kids."

19:50.730 --> 19:52.330
Sweet guy, Matt Damon.

19:52.331 --> 19:53.664
He's my friend.

19:53.665 --> 19:56.032
You know, we should all
hang out before...

19:56.033 --> 19:59.000
Jeannie beannie,
what are you doing here?

19:59.001 --> 20:00.768
Finishing up a project.

20:00.769 --> 20:01.968
Who is your friend?

20:01.969 --> 20:03.736
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you noticed her.

20:03.737 --> 20:04.803
I'm so embarrassed.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.070
This is Samantha.

20:06.071 --> 20:07.738
She's a business
major over at ucla,

20:07.739 --> 20:09.472
and her biggest turn-on
is corporate America.

20:09.473 --> 20:10.639
Can you believe it?

20:11.640 --> 20:12.907
So, which office is yours?

20:12.908 --> 20:14.774
That huge one. You see
that huge one over there?

20:14.775 --> 20:16.175
Mm-hmm. Go up there.
Do whatever you want.

20:17.543 --> 20:19.977
Unless you want to hear
what it sounds like

20:19.978 --> 20:21.378
when I have sex
with a half-Asian girl,

20:21.379 --> 20:22.612
I suggest you get out of here.

20:22.613 --> 20:23.813
Hmm...

20:23.814 --> 20:25.480
Are you sucking a dick

20:25.481 --> 20:26.613
or throwing up?
Throwing up.

20:26.614 --> 20:27.581
Throwing up. Okay.

20:28.915 --> 20:30.248
Ppgs's?

20:30.249 --> 20:32.449
Doesn't Marty usually
deal with those?

20:32.450 --> 20:34.717
Yep.

20:34.718 --> 20:36.117
The fuck is this?

20:37.986 --> 20:39.953
Hold up, are they giving you
your own pod?

20:39.954 --> 20:41.454
Yeah.

20:41.455 --> 20:43.722
I think I'm gonna take it.
Of course you're gonna take it.

20:43.723 --> 20:44.722
Why the fuck
wouldn't you take it?

20:46.024 --> 20:47.657
This is huge, Jeannie.
Congratulations.

20:47.658 --> 20:49.157
Thanks.
Yeah.

20:49.158 --> 20:50.925
Your office is locked.

20:50.926 --> 20:52.660
Yeah, we're gonna head out.
So let's go.

20:54.328 --> 20:56.261
Why does it say "Marty kaan"
on your door?

20:56.262 --> 20:57.662
It's my nickname, okay?

20:57.663 --> 20:59.763
Let's just go.

21:15.072 --> 21:16.138
Morning, pop.

21:16.139 --> 21:18.705
Morning.

21:18.706 --> 21:21.407
Malcolm show up yet?

21:21.408 --> 21:22.974
No, not yet.

21:22.975 --> 21:24.809
Not yet, huh?

21:26.910 --> 21:29.644
Well, I wouldn't
get my hopes up.

21:29.645 --> 21:31.745
What's that supposed to mean?

21:36.315 --> 21:39.549
I gave him a charitable
donation last night.

21:40.450 --> 21:44.051
I over-donated.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.218
You paid him to leave?

21:46.219 --> 21:48.453
No. I gave him

21:48.454 --> 21:49.754
a choice,

21:49.755 --> 21:52.022
and he chose.

21:52.023 --> 21:53.997
Can't believe it.

21:53.998 --> 21:56.272
The fuck is wrong with you?

21:56.273 --> 21:57.841
Wait, wait...

21:57.842 --> 22:00.143
Pop, doesn't this just prove
that his whole desire

22:00.144 --> 22:02.578
to reconnect with his family
was just a bunch of bullshit?

22:02.579 --> 22:03.746
What it proves

22:03.747 --> 22:06.748
is what a manipulative person
you can be.

22:06.749 --> 22:08.115
Wait a minute.

22:08.116 --> 22:10.284
He conned you out of
I don't know how much money.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.819
He didn't con me out of any money. Okay.

22:11.820 --> 22:13.320
Whatever. I-I'm the
manipulative one?

22:13.321 --> 22:14.487
Pop, you're a grown man.

22:14.488 --> 22:15.921
You can do whatever you want
with your money.

22:15.922 --> 22:17.155
Hmm.
But he's trying

22:17.156 --> 22:19.758
to use Roscoe, okay?

22:19.759 --> 22:21.726
I'm-I'm just supposed
to be cool with that?

22:21.727 --> 22:23.160
Well, no, 'cause that's
your domain.

22:23.161 --> 22:25.730
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

22:25.731 --> 22:28.003
What it means is you've been
trying to get your brother

22:28.004 --> 22:29.741
to leave here since
the minute he came,

22:29.742 --> 22:31.110
so you used me and your son

22:31.111 --> 22:32.444
to justify this shitty,

22:32.445 --> 22:34.412
<i>shitty thing you've done.</i>

22:34.413 --> 22:35.847
Congratulations, Martin.

22:35.848 --> 22:37.048
Pop.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.317
Pop.

22:50.395 --> 22:52.462
Hey, uh...

22:52.463 --> 22:53.897
Clyde, you-you never asked me

22:53.898 --> 22:55.565
how my, uh, meeting
went yesterday.

22:55.566 --> 22:57.267
Yeah, it's 'cause
I don't give a fuck.

22:59.737 --> 23:01.037
How'd your meeting
go yesterday, Doug?

23:01.038 --> 23:04.340
Went as smooth
as butter on a baby's ass.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.843
Why would you put butter
on a baby's ass?

23:06.844 --> 23:08.956
It's a figure of speech.

23:08.957 --> 23:11.695
Jeannie, can you do me a favor
and put a bullet in my head?

23:11.696 --> 23:13.696
In a minute.

23:16.467 --> 23:18.134
Finally got your ppgs's.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.336
Here is a list of people

23:19.337 --> 23:20.770
that I think you
can poach, and...

23:20.771 --> 23:22.205
Yeah, you know what,
you-you call them.

23:22.206 --> 23:23.573
Now you want me to call them?

23:23.574 --> 23:24.741
Yeah, they're your contacts.

23:24.742 --> 23:25.909
But they've always
been my contacts.

23:25.910 --> 23:27.010
What's changed, exactly?

23:27.011 --> 23:28.445
Jeannie, what do you
want me to say?

23:28.446 --> 23:29.646
I don't want you
to say anything...

23:29.647 --> 23:30.714
Oh.

23:30.715 --> 23:34.017
Look at this,
here are my all-stars.

23:34.018 --> 23:35.352
Hey.

23:35.353 --> 23:36.753
You know, a little bird told me

23:36.754 --> 23:38.387
that you gave this one
her own pod.

23:38.388 --> 23:39.922
I did.

23:39.923 --> 23:41.056
What, don't you think

23:41.057 --> 23:42.224
she deserves it?

23:42.225 --> 23:43.392
Well, honestly, I think

23:43.393 --> 23:44.926
<i>she deserves your job.</i>

23:46.162 --> 23:48.329
Marty, you know,
at the end of the day,

23:48.330 --> 23:49.931
I have got to decide what's best

23:49.932 --> 23:52.500
for the future of this company.

23:52.501 --> 23:55.069
No, absolutely, but our pod

23:55.070 --> 23:57.104
kind of keeps
the company afloat,

23:57.105 --> 23:58.239
and I can't do that

23:58.240 --> 23:59.674
without her. I mean...

23:59.675 --> 24:01.275
Jeannie's not somebody
I can just replace.

24:01.276 --> 24:02.710
So, I understand you
having to make

24:02.711 --> 24:04.611
the hard decisions, but
in the future, mm-hmm. Yes.

24:04.612 --> 24:06.079
It would be great
if you just gave

24:06.080 --> 24:07.080
old Marty a heads-up.
Okay, well,

24:07.081 --> 24:08.314
you know what I think?

24:08.315 --> 24:09.883
I think, Marty, that you and I

24:09.884 --> 24:11.084
should continue
this discussion later.

24:11.085 --> 24:12.219
I...
In private.

24:12.220 --> 24:14.253
Yeah.
Okay.

24:14.254 --> 24:16.188
I look forward to that.
Me, too.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.356
Good to see you.

24:17.357 --> 24:18.424
Yeah.

24:18.425 --> 24:21.026
Great.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.727
That was a jump ball.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.795
What, you think I'm afraid
of julianne hofschraeger?

24:24.796 --> 24:26.460
She scares the shit out of me.

24:26.461 --> 24:27.691
Yeah, me, too.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.294
Hmm.

24:32.295 --> 24:36.231
So, you ready for this
shit storm that's coming?

24:36.232 --> 24:38.232
Bring on the shit.

24:39.935 --> 24:41.669
What are you doing?

24:41.670 --> 24:43.904
I don't know. Isn't
that how you do it?

24:45.073 --> 24:46.640
All right.

24:46.641 --> 24:48.109
Get on those calls, okay?

24:48.110 --> 24:49.510
I actually have
a dinner tonight

24:49.511 --> 24:51.944
with Nate...
That I can cancel.

24:51.945 --> 24:53.812
I'm-I'm happy to cancel.
Oh.

24:53.813 --> 24:55.681
Uh, no, that's cool.

24:55.682 --> 24:57.347
I can cancel it. I really... hey.

24:57.348 --> 24:58.948
Nate.
Hey, Nate.

24:58.949 --> 25:00.149
Have you met Marty?

25:00.150 --> 25:01.650
Hey. The dildo king,
at your service.

25:01.651 --> 25:03.251
What?
Yeah.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.486
That is what
you guys call me, yes?

25:04.487 --> 25:05.787
Yeah.
No, nobody says that.

25:05.788 --> 25:07.589
I... I'm pretty sure
it's what you guys call me.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.591
I told him. I've been called
a lot worse. It's okay.

25:09.592 --> 25:12.093
Uh, you ready to go?
You need more time?

25:12.094 --> 25:13.494
Um, I think I need...
Yeah.

25:13.495 --> 25:14.529
Absolutely.
Okay.

25:14.530 --> 25:15.596
I'll just be down there.
Okay.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.298
Hey. Nice meeting you, dk.

25:17.299 --> 25:18.899
There it is.

25:20.634 --> 25:22.835
We're on a good road, right?

25:22.836 --> 25:24.637
Like, this will
work itself out?

25:24.638 --> 25:25.838
Oh, yeah.

25:25.839 --> 25:27.840
We're... just blue skies
from here on out.

25:27.841 --> 25:29.475
Okay.

25:29.476 --> 25:31.177
Okay.

25:34.782 --> 25:36.716
What... are you doing?
I'll be back.

25:36.717 --> 25:38.918
* Never thought
that you'd ever get caught *

25:38.919 --> 25:40.853
* with your hand
up in the cookie jar *

25:40.854 --> 25:42.888
Don't dildo anything
I wouldn't dildo.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.790
* Playing spades
with the devil now *

25:44.791 --> 25:48.226
* boy, what you have to go
and do that for? *

25:48.227 --> 25:51.095
* now I lay me down to sleep *

25:51.096 --> 25:52.363
* I pray the lord *

25:52.364 --> 25:54.398
* my soul to keep *

25:54.399 --> 25:56.667
* and if I die before I wake *
