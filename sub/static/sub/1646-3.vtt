NARRATOR:
Previously on Prison Break .'

00:02.586 --> 00:05.548
I'm giving you an opportunity
to avoid 15 years in jail.

00:05.715 --> 00:07.508
- In exchange for?
- Scylla.

00:07.884 --> 00:10.553
These are GPS ankle monitors.
I'm your boss.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.848
And if I ask you to put on a monitor,
you put on the monitor.

00:14.056 --> 00:17.185
MAHONE: Whistler's assignment was to
drop off Scylla to a Company executive.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.187
And his job was to protect it.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.565
When this is all done, you and me,
we're gonna settle up.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.984
I'm looking for Alex.

OFFICER: Hey, hey. You don't wanna go
in there. You don't wanna go in there.

00:39.832 --> 00:42.084
Where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

00:42.251 --> 00:45.379
I swear to you,
I have no idea where they are.

00:45.755 --> 00:48.216
- What's wrong?
- Whatever it is, it ain't it.

00:48.382 --> 00:52.345
If Scylla was like a pizza,
all we got is a slice.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.389
So Scylla isn't one card. It's six.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.991
- Hey. What did you pull us into?
SELF: Excuse me?

01:14.116 --> 01:18.996
Figured you'd get us on the hook so we
could find out how screwed this was.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.958
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The card, Agent Self.

01:22.083 --> 01:26.462
- I'm talking about the card. It's useless.
- Wait, hold on. You already got the card?

01:26.629 --> 01:29.215
Yes, but without the other five cards,
it means nothing.

01:29.382 --> 01:31.300
And I can only assume you knew that.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.094
What other five?

01:34.262 --> 01:36.180
Don't.

01:36.347 --> 01:37.473
What other five?

01:38.933 --> 01:42.478
Roland downloaded the card.
There's no Company data on the card.

01:42.645 --> 01:45.064
So without the other five cards,
it's unreadable.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.149
It's like one-sixth of the puzzle.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.318
That's not my problem
because we had a deal.

01:49.485 --> 01:52.154
- And we gave you what you asked for.
- No, you didn't.

01:52.321 --> 01:55.074
We had a deal for you to get me Scylla
and you haven't.

01:55.241 --> 01:57.702
- You gave me your word.
- I'm giving you my word again.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.622
You will go back to prison if
you can't get me those other five cards.

02:03.749 --> 02:07.920
But if you can't get this done, just let
me know and we'll get your cell ready.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.798
- You understand?
- I'll get it done.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.009
SELF:
There's one more thing.

02:16.429 --> 02:18.681
- What did he say?
MICHAEL: We gotta find the other cards.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.516
BELLICK: Screw that, man.
We got the card.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.184
Let's do the break-in and end this.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.146
MICHAEL: Doesn't work that way.
- It's not fair, we did what he said.

02:25.313 --> 02:28.441
Then call Agent Self,
tell him you wanna go back to Fox River.

02:29.025 --> 02:32.653
Hell, we're all gonna go to prison
if we can't find the other cards.

02:33.487 --> 02:37.199
When the government gets scared,
they tend to cut the cord.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.368
Did Self talk about shutting us down?

02:39.535 --> 02:42.830
Let's just concentrate on finding Scylla,
all right?

02:47.126 --> 02:48.878
Alex.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.340
- Where is he going?
- Who cares?

02:52.506 --> 02:55.718
How we gonna find Scylla?
We don't even know where to start.

02:56.135 --> 02:59.972
- Where's the rest of the stuff you found?
- Still printing it up.

03:00.473 --> 03:03.851
When my device was in Tuxhorn's
house, it must've been next to his PDA.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.270
Sucked up data from it.
I got e-mails and photos.

03:06.437 --> 03:09.523
- You see anything we can use?
- No, and let me be crystal clear.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.485
I point and click.
Other than that, I'm off the clock.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.570
- Shut up.
MICHAEL: Wait. Where's his calendar?

03:14.737 --> 03:16.155
Dr. Feelgood's got it.

03:16.906 --> 03:19.450
Here, take a look at this.

03:19.617 --> 03:22.161
This is today's date.
There's nothing on it but a star.

03:22.328 --> 03:26.332
Every other date has details for his
meetings, who he's with, when, where.

03:26.499 --> 03:30.252
- This is the only thing with nothing.
- Must be a reason he's keeping it secret.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.339
Why are we letting Self call the shots?
We should play hardball.

03:33.506 --> 03:35.841
From now on,
either help out or get out.

03:36.008 --> 03:39.428
If you open your mouth,
I expect you to offer up a solution.

05:10.352 --> 05:13.189
You don't now. What's going on?

05:15.649 --> 05:20.321
Self said we have until the end of
the day to find the next cardholder...

05:20.654 --> 05:22.198
...or we all go back to prison.

in Texas.

don't you, Bruce?

than you're already in.

It's a great day for a family picnic.

Don't you think so, Bruce?

06:59.461 --> 07:03.549

That's not what you sold me, Don.

07:03.716 --> 07:07.052
- I realize it's more than we anticipated.
- More than you anticipated.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.889
I already have people questioning me
about the supermax line we're selling.

07:11.056 --> 07:14.143
- This whole thing was a mistake.
- No, no, this wasn't a mistake.

07:14.310 --> 07:17.896
Scofield got us a card within 24 hours
of being dropped in Los Angeles.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.315
He knows what he's doing.

07:19.732 --> 07:23.944
I'm willing to take the risk and do my job
here. I don't understand why you aren't.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.655
I've been in Homeland Security
before it had a name.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.491
Since before you
even had a short and curly, so don't--

07:29.658 --> 07:32.244
Then you should know
what's at stake here, director.

07:32.411 --> 07:35.831
But we could stop it, but--
But not if you end this now.

07:35.998 --> 07:40.794
I'm calling Senator Dallow now. I will
see if he wants this thing killed or not.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.757
But he follows my recommendations,
Don.

"Sir, changed your late London arrival.
Now 7-16 at 4 p.m."

07:54.725 --> 07:57.853
Today's the 16th, but there's nothing
about London in his calendar.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.188
Not that we've seen, no.

07:59.355 --> 08:03.025
- Nothing about travel to or from the U.K.?
- No, nothing.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.819
Why would he get an e-mail
about an arrival in London...

08:05.986 --> 08:08.405
...when he has no business
scheduled there?

08:08.530 --> 08:12.159
Probably because the e-mail is a code.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.040
Alex, I'm so glad you joined us.

08:18.207 --> 08:24.213
S-C-Y-L-L-A, Scylla.
The meeting today at 4 is about Scylla.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.924
Tuxhorn did not schedule a meeting
with himself...

08:27.091 --> 08:29.718
...so that is where
we're gonna find our next cardholder.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.471
Okay, so 4 p.m. is our when.
We need a where.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.225
If you're having a secret meeting,
you don't send the information together.

08:36.392 --> 08:39.520
You'd send the where and the when
separately as a precaution.

08:40.979 --> 08:45.067
Were there other e-mails sent to Tuxhorn
at the same time as the London e-mail?

08:45.234 --> 08:48.737
Within a few seconds of the London mail,
two more followed from the same IF'.

08:48.904 --> 08:52.449
My device ran out of space. It picked up
the IP address but not the content.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.744
Trace the IP address.
Find out who sent the e-mails.

08:55.911 --> 08:59.581
E-mails get bounced to routers all over
the world before they end in your lnbox.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.042
Wherever the mail's been,
it leaves a shadow file.

09:02.209 --> 09:06.088
Based on the geography, I'd guess these
e-mails squatted at the Anaheim server...

09:06.255 --> 09:10.426
...a nanosecond before reaching Tuxhorn.
That's where you're gonna find your file.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.885
So get it.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.555
Not every geek with a Commodore 64
can hack into NASA.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.474
These servers have more firewalls
than the devil's bedroom.

09:17.599 --> 09:21.103
You want those e-mails? I'm sorry,
it's on a main server in Anaheim.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.731
It is possible to find those e-mails
at that server?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.233
- Technologically possible.
- We're going to Anaheim.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.444
I want you two
to go to Tuxhorn's workplace.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.280
Stake it out.
If you see him, tail him and call us.

09:31.447 --> 09:34.783
You're just gonna walk up to
a main server? There's gonna be security.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.786
We don't have a choice.
We have to find that e-mail message.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.290
We find out where the meeting is,
we find our next cardholder. Got it?

09:41.457 --> 09:43.792
- And we stay out of jail.
- Yeah, good luck, man.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.545

- Guess again.

Bother me? What are you talking about?

I'm thrilled to finally be able
to put a voice to the e-mails.

And better yet, I'm gonna be able
to put a face to the voice.

perhaps Denmark or Chad will be our pig.
