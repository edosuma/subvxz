00:02.801 --> 00:05.401
The worst criminal
offenders are pursued

00:05.402 --> 00:07.602
By the detectives of the
major case squad.

00:08.267 --> 00:09.703
These are their stories.

00:12.371 --> 00:14.672
- Physician's world.
- Give me a break.

00:15.308 --> 00:17.710
- What?
We're in the medical business.

00:17.777 --> 00:18.711
- Are we ever.

00:18.778 --> 00:21.780
7% equity in tribeca comm

00:21.848 --> 00:24.550
And a 12% interest
in our investment.

00:24.617 --> 00:26.385
Henry, come here.
Come here.

00:26.453 --> 00:28.053
Mwah. I love this kid.

00:28.121 --> 00:29.354
Where's cubby
with the sausage?

00:29.422 --> 00:30.789
- Right here.
- Good man.

00:30.857 --> 00:33.358
- Henry,
I'll swap you for a beer.

00:33.426 --> 00:35.160
- Mr. Prime time.
How's the reality show?

00:35.228 --> 00:37.730
- Reality?
The producer made me

00:37.797 --> 00:40.032
Rename my sandwiches
after italian painters.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.134
- Cubby, what do they call
the sausage and peppers?

00:42.202 --> 00:43.669
- A "mickel-angelo."

00:43.737 --> 00:45.738
- "michael-angelo."
and I'll take one, henry.

00:45.805 --> 00:47.139
Make me a michelangelo.

00:47.207 --> 00:49.074
- Sausage and peppers, right?

00:49.142 --> 00:51.543
Comes with a side
of a heart attack?

00:51.611 --> 00:53.245
Give him a gardenburger,
henry.

00:53.313 --> 00:55.080
- Listen,
with this hospital thing,

00:55.148 --> 00:56.548
In 18 months,

00:56.616 --> 01:00.285
We're looking at
900k a year each minimum

01:00.353 --> 01:01.253
Off henry's deal.

01:01.321 --> 01:02.988
- Get out.
Get in.

01:03.056 --> 01:05.524
Until some genius comes up
with the cure for death,

01:05.592 --> 01:07.593
Hospitals are gonna be
open for business.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.061
- Whose christmas list
you on, henry?

01:09.129 --> 01:10.362
- Buddy of mine
and his partner

01:10.430 --> 01:11.897
Bought tribeca community
hospital.

01:11.965 --> 01:13.198
Went to dartmouth together.

01:13.266 --> 01:16.401
- And who made you
stay and graduate?

01:16.469 --> 01:17.569
- Oh, you know
what we should do?

01:17.637 --> 01:19.104
Assisted suicides.

01:19.172 --> 01:20.739
- They're illegal, blev.

01:20.807 --> 01:22.174
- On the sly.

01:22.242 --> 01:24.343
By the time the rest of the
country comes to her senses,

01:24.410 --> 01:25.677
We'll be way ahead.

01:25.745 --> 01:28.580
- Those were the old ways.

01:28.648 --> 01:32.017
But we are through
with the old ways.

01:32.085 --> 01:33.852
Right?

01:33.920 --> 01:36.121
How about you, blev?

01:36.189 --> 01:37.289
Are you with me, cubby?

01:37.357 --> 01:38.290
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:38.358 --> 01:39.792
- Dom, you?

01:39.859 --> 01:40.793
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:44.531 --> 01:46.198
- I'm about to authorize
a medicare audit

01:46.266 --> 01:48.100
On silver-spring
health systems.

01:48.168 --> 01:49.101
When it's completed,

01:49.169 --> 01:50.803
You and your partner

01:50.870 --> 01:53.605
Will undoubtedly
face criminal charges.

01:53.673 --> 01:55.240
- For what?

01:55.308 --> 01:57.009
- Silver-springs colonoscopies

01:57.076 --> 01:59.678
Are 300% over the norm.

01:59.746 --> 02:02.514
Echocardiograms
are 375% higher

02:02.582 --> 02:03.982
Than they should be.

02:04.050 --> 02:06.285
- Business is good.

02:06.352 --> 02:09.420
Three months ago we acquired
tribeca community hospital.

02:09.489 --> 02:10.788
- Well, the criminal activity

02:10.857 --> 02:13.091
Took place
before that purchase.

02:13.159 --> 02:15.961
I found over 200
up-coding violations.

02:16.029 --> 02:17.629
- Up-coding?

02:17.697 --> 02:20.098
- Simple gastritis
billed as a colonoscopy,

02:20.166 --> 02:22.467
Coding a level-one visit
as a level-four surgery.

02:22.535 --> 02:25.137
- But this
is someone else's mistak

02:25.205 --> 02:26.638
- While the audit's in place,

02:26.706 --> 02:28.674
Your practice
and the new hospital

02:28.741 --> 02:33.111
Receive no medicare
reimbursements.

02:33.179 --> 02:35.347
We're gonna
turn the faucet off.

02:40.019 --> 02:42.621
- What do you want from me,
tarney?

02:42.689 --> 02:46.124
- 3 million.
Cash.

02:46.192 --> 02:49.461
- Oh, holy crap.
What are we gonna do?

02:49.529 --> 02:52.030
- Stall. I'll meet
with that prick, tarney, again.

02:52.098 --> 02:55.067
He'll take less.
- Yeah, well, what if he won't?

02:55.134 --> 02:56.768
We got to tell henry, joel.

02:56.836 --> 02:57.936
- Are you nuts?
No.

02:58.004 --> 02:59.671
- No, he's a friend.
A good friend.

02:59.739 --> 03:00.672
He'll understand.

03:00.740 --> 03:01.707
- Understand what, shelly?

03:01.774 --> 03:02.975
That after he invested

03:03.042 --> 03:04.776
We forgot to tell him
that we cook the books?

03:04.844 --> 03:06.144
You say nothing to him.

03:06.212 --> 03:07.613
You keep your mouth shut
about this.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.182
We'll handle it.
All right?

03:10.250 --> 03:13.752
Shelly?

03:13.820 --> 03:16.255
Not one word.

03:16.322 --> 03:17.756
- Possible m.I.

03:17.824 --> 03:19.625
- Sorry.
He's got a bad heart.

03:19.692 --> 03:21.660
I look,
he's down on the lawn.

03:21.728 --> 03:23.862
Dom,
just breathe easy.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.764
Breathe easy.
- Down there, down there. Bay 4.

03:29.669 --> 03:31.503
- Hi, this is les tarney.

03:31.571 --> 03:33.105
I'm not in.
Leave me a message at the beep.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.274
les, where are you?

03:35.341 --> 03:36.975
I have been calling
and calling.

03:37.043 --> 03:38.644
You're supposed to come
and pick me up.

03:38.711 --> 03:40.646
We're going to dinner.
Hello?

03:40.713 --> 03:44.650
Les? Ugh. Okay, that's it.
I'm coming over.

04:32.145 --> 04:33.512
- Les tarney.

04:33.580 --> 04:35.748
The United States department
of health and human resources.

04:35.816 --> 04:37.416
Associate inspector general.

04:37.484 --> 04:40.219
- Not anymore.
Choked to death.

04:40.287 --> 04:41.220
- Yeah.

04:41.288 --> 04:43.055
So the chair is knocked over.

04:43.123 --> 04:46.092
I see. And so maybe he did
the heimlich on himself?

04:46.159 --> 04:48.527
- Yup. Unfortunately,

04:48.595 --> 04:52.198
Works better when someone's
there to do it for you.

04:52.266 --> 04:55.501
- Well, how long has
les tarney been like this?

04:55.569 --> 04:57.336
- About three hours.

04:57.404 --> 05:00.339
Puts t.O.D. Around 8:00 p.M.
This evening.

05:00.407 --> 05:01.774
- So he choked.

05:01.842 --> 05:03.876
Why-why call homicide?

05:03.944 --> 05:05.911
- Woman who found him
lost it.

05:05.979 --> 05:07.013
Told anyone who would listen

05:07.080 --> 05:08.681
That somebody
murdered her fiance.

05:08.749 --> 05:12.918
- The life of a single man.

05:12.986 --> 05:15.187
His, uh, plate's
turned the wrong way.

05:15.255 --> 05:19.725
- Yeah. Well,
I'll wrangle a photographer.

05:21.461 --> 05:23.229
- We planned to get married.

05:23.297 --> 05:25.698
- You said you found
mr. Tarney around 9:00?

05:25.766 --> 05:27.266
- Mm-hmm.

05:27.334 --> 05:29.735
- Oh, this is
detective nichols.

05:29.803 --> 05:33.406
Julia hiken
was engaged to the deceased.

05:33.473 --> 05:36.275
- Well,
engaged to be engaged.

05:36.343 --> 05:39.011
- You arrived at, uh, 9:00.

05:39.079 --> 05:40.946
Was he expecting you?

05:41.014 --> 05:42.748
- I was expecting him.

05:42.816 --> 05:44.984
Les was supposed
to pick me up.

05:45.052 --> 05:47.086
Never showed.

05:47.154 --> 05:49.221
His cell kept kicking
to his answering service.

05:49.289 --> 05:51.257
- So you came here.

05:51.325 --> 05:52.291
- I knocked and knocked,

05:52.359 --> 05:54.493
Finally used the key
under the mat.

05:54.561 --> 05:56.996
- And then did you
do anything to revive him?

05:57.064 --> 05:58.564
- I'm an r.N.

05:58.632 --> 06:01.233
I could see he was dead.

06:01.301 --> 06:03.336
Someone killed him.

06:03.403 --> 06:05.771
- I see.
Well, the problem, julia,

06:05.839 --> 06:09.241
Is that, um, your fiance,

06:09.309 --> 06:12.712
His death looks a lot
like it's accidental.

06:12.779 --> 06:14.780
- No. No.

06:14.848 --> 06:16.349
Uh-uh.

06:16.416 --> 06:18.784
No, we were going out
to dinner.

06:18.852 --> 06:22.288
We were going to celebrate.

06:22.356 --> 06:25.958
Someone did this.

06:29.396 --> 06:33.733
He was working
on something big.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.968
We were gonna live good.

06:36.036 --> 06:37.970
Maybe in europe.

06:38.038 --> 06:41.407
- So did he say
what something big meant?

06:41.475 --> 06:44.176
- I don't have a head
for business.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.214
- Someone's in denial.

06:48.281 --> 06:52.184
- You think les gave julia
the heave-ho?

06:52.252 --> 06:54.086
That's right.
So what did this guy do?

06:54.154 --> 06:57.757
Turns off his cell phone
and sits down to a quiet meal,

06:57.824 --> 07:00.292
Pours himself a nice glass
of the verboten stuff...

07:00.360 --> 07:01.494
- Detectives?

07:01.561 --> 07:02.828
Found this pill in the hall.

07:02.896 --> 07:05.131
We checked. Nothing like it
in the medicine cabinet.

07:09.269 --> 07:10.469
- All right.

07:10.537 --> 07:12.304
So bag up everything
that's on the counter.

07:12.372 --> 07:14.440
That whole dinner,
the steak and the wine,

07:14.508 --> 07:18.577
Everything
that's on the counter.

07:18.645 --> 07:20.980
- Les tarney is dead.

07:21.047 --> 07:22.548
- What?

07:22.616 --> 07:24.650
- Saw it on webmd,
answer-med, healthcentral.

07:24.718 --> 07:26.252
It's all over the internet.

07:26.319 --> 07:28.287
They're saying
he choked on his food.

07:28.355 --> 07:30.823
- Oh, my god.

07:30.891 --> 07:33.392
Well,
somebody likes us, huh?

07:33.460 --> 07:35.194
- It's murder, shelly.

07:35.262 --> 07:36.495
- You said he choked.

07:36.563 --> 07:39.231
- Stop it!
Just-just-just stop it.

07:39.299 --> 07:41.434
- Stop what?

07:41.501 --> 07:43.769
- You talked, didn't you?

07:43.837 --> 07:44.770
I knew it.

07:44.838 --> 07:46.439
- What-wait a minute.

07:46.506 --> 07:51.010
You saying that I told henry
and that he had tarney whacked?

07:51.077 --> 07:54.313
No, joel.
Are you crazy?

07:54.381 --> 07:55.948
- He's magglio depia's son.

07:56.016 --> 07:57.850
- Henry would never do that.

07:57.918 --> 08:01.887
He's nothing like his father.

08:01.955 --> 08:05.157
I didn't talk to him.

08:05.225 --> 08:07.326
I swear.

08:07.394 --> 08:09.261
We just got very lucky.

08:09.329 --> 08:11.530
This was an accident.

08:11.598 --> 08:15.801
A divine accident.

08:24.478 --> 08:25.911
- Substantial piece of meat

08:25.979 --> 08:27.379
Lodged deep in his trachea.

08:27.447 --> 08:28.848
Teeth marks match.

08:28.915 --> 08:30.816
- Uh, nothing
indicating a struggle?

08:30.884 --> 08:32.952
- But for the chair,
not a mark on him.

08:33.019 --> 08:34.419
- Looked like
he didn't eat much steak.

08:34.488 --> 08:37.121
- He didn't eat any.
Stomach was empty.

08:37.190 --> 08:38.591
- All right, so, uh,

08:38.658 --> 08:40.426
What's the first thing you do
when you choke?

08:40.494 --> 08:42.260
- Grab for something to drink.

08:42.328 --> 08:44.230
- Right, but his wine
isn't touched.

08:44.297 --> 08:46.165
Plus chokes on the first bite.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.968
- Well, he might have had
some help with that.

08:49.035 --> 08:51.036
I found heavy traces

08:51.104 --> 08:53.606
Of the beta blocker
inderal in his system.

08:53.673 --> 08:55.674
Common side effect
is difficulty swallowing.

08:55.742 --> 08:58.677
- What about the capsule
csu found in tarney's house?

08:58.745 --> 09:00.279
- That was digoxin.

09:00.347 --> 09:02.648
- Digoxin. Oh, that's
different than inderal.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.817
Digoxin is for
congestive heart failure

09:04.885 --> 09:06.252
When nothing else works.

09:06.319 --> 09:07.987
- Well, you know your meds.

09:08.054 --> 09:09.421
- The house I grew up in

09:09.489 --> 09:12.324
Had a physician's
desk reference in the john.

09:12.392 --> 09:14.894
What about mr. Tarney
and digoxin?

09:14.961 --> 09:16.795
- It's not something
he'd be taking.

09:16.863 --> 09:18.397
His heart was good.

09:18.465 --> 09:20.299
I'm ready to rule accidental.

09:20.367 --> 09:23.469
- It's not gonna make
the fiancee happy.

09:23.537 --> 09:26.338
- And his plate
was turned the wrong way.

09:26.406 --> 09:29.942
- What are you saying?

09:30.010 --> 09:34.313
- Uh, give it till tomorrow?

09:44.558 --> 09:46.358
- What the hell happened?

09:46.426 --> 09:48.727
- He comes by
henry's last night

09:48.795 --> 09:50.362
With a couple
of salmon stea,

09:50.430 --> 09:53.432
And he just-he goes down before
the charcoal even gets hot.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.968
- It's a myocardial infarction.
It's bad.

09:56.036 --> 09:57.836
- He's gonna live, right?

09:57.904 --> 10:00.139
- If he dies,
I'm gonna kill him.

10:00.206 --> 10:01.340
I mean,
we've known each other

10:01.408 --> 10:02.508
Since our first communion.

10:02.576 --> 10:05.177
- Dom, I'm sorry.

10:05.245 --> 10:08.180
I'm so sorry.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.853
- You ready for me?

10:21.921 --> 10:22.987
- Hey, come on in.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.356
A.D.A. Roydell getty.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.091
Bureau chief of trial division.

10:27.159 --> 10:28.660
Detectives stevens
and nichols.

10:28.727 --> 10:30.929
- Another long suffering
cubs fan.

10:30.996 --> 10:32.797
- I roll with the white sox,
actually.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.165
- Smart girl.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.433
Detective nichols,

10:35.501 --> 10:37.268
I met your dad the other night
at the guggenheim.

10:37.336 --> 10:38.269
Nice man.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.604
- Yes, he is.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.473
- Got a call from
health and human resources.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.707
They asked to be informed

10:42.775 --> 10:44.843
As soon as tarney's death
is determined

10:44.910 --> 10:46.311
Accidental or foul play.

10:46.378 --> 10:48.746
- Sure. Sure.
One of their own went down.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.015
- And since the healthcare
reform bill passed,

10:51.083 --> 10:52.584
They've been treated
to death threats,

10:52.651 --> 10:54.052
Bomb scares, hate mail.

10:54.119 --> 10:56.187
- What happened
to writing your congressman?

10:56.255 --> 10:58.189
- 21st century, detective.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.725
We don't do quiet anymore.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.227
- Ain't it the truth.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.330
So h.H.R. Thinks
that somebody's out to get him?

11:05.397 --> 11:06.865
- People are scared
over there.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.566
- Do we have anything
more to go on

11:08.634 --> 11:11.336
Than a half-chewed
piece of steak?

11:11.403 --> 11:12.937
- The only prints
in tarney's house

11:13.005 --> 11:14.339
Are his and his girlfriend's.

11:14.406 --> 11:16.808
- The m.E. Did find
inderal in tarney's system.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.309
We checked
his medical records.

11:18.377 --> 11:19.410
He didn't get it
from a doctor.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.145
- What about a nurse?

11:21.213 --> 11:23.414
The girlfriend,
julia hiken,

11:23.482 --> 11:25.917
Isn't she an r.N.?
- Uh-huh.

11:25.985 --> 11:29.287
- I told you,
when I got there, les was dead.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.623
- Les, or your relationship
with him?

11:31.690 --> 11:33.258
- We had made plans.
We were-

11:33.325 --> 11:35.693
- Engaged to be engaged.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.296
The last refuge
of the commitment challenged.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.098
- I had a future with les.

11:40.165 --> 11:41.599
- But no key to his house.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.235
- Why'd you give him
the beta blockers, julia?

11:44.303 --> 11:48.439
- He wanted them.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.709
They work
like tranquilizers.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.177
Les asked me for them,

11:53.245 --> 11:55.113
Because he said he had
to be totally calm

11:55.180 --> 11:56.714
For a meeting he had
with someone.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.049
- Did he say who?

11:58.117 --> 12:00.718
- No. No.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.621
- But he said something.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.156
What did he say, julia?

12:05.224 --> 12:06.558
What did he say
about that meeting?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.626
- That big deal
that I told you about,

12:08.694 --> 12:10.929
The one that was gonna
set us up,

12:10.996 --> 12:13.064
That was the meeting.

12:13.132 --> 12:16.134
I told him just two pills.

12:16.201 --> 12:18.069
And he-he took three.

12:18.137 --> 12:22.640
- Do you have a prescription
for inderal?

12:22.708 --> 12:23.908
You stole the pills.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.144
- I didn't want to lose les.

12:26.211 --> 12:28.446
Please.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.515
Does my employer have to know?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.751
My job is all I've got left.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.657
- Mr. Tarney cancelled
his morning meetings

12:39.725 --> 12:41.259
And remained in his office.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.963
- Uh-huh. And, uh, no-
no meetings in the afternoon?

12:45.030 --> 12:47.031
- Just one.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.032
At 5:30.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.101
With...

12:50.169 --> 12:51.936
Dr. Joel silverstern.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.538
Tribeca community hospital.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.206
237 canal street.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.908
- That was the last time
you saw him?

12:56.976 --> 12:58.309
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.377 --> 13:00.211
- Forgive me for saying this,
carla,

13:00.279 --> 13:01.446
But, um, you know,

13:01.513 --> 13:04.215
I mean, everybody grieves
in their own way,

13:04.283 --> 13:08.720
But you don't seem too saddened
by the passing of your boss.

13:08.787 --> 13:09.787
- You know how some people

13:09.855 --> 13:11.189
Have to do mean things
for their job

13:11.256 --> 13:13.157
But they're perfectly nice
otherwise?

13:13.225 --> 13:14.659
- Hmm.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.160
- Les tarney wasn't nice?

13:16.228 --> 13:17.729
- He was a cactus ass

13:17.796 --> 13:20.398
Who made everyone
around him miserable.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.868
And he enjoyed it.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.671
- I know.
Les tarney's death is tragic.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.339
I read it on medweb.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.974
It was a piece of food?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.710
- How does the web find out
everything before we do?

13:32.778 --> 13:34.112
- Dr. Silverstern,

13:34.179 --> 13:35.747
You said
you met mr. Tarney here

13:35.814 --> 13:37.348
Around 5:45?

13:37.416 --> 13:38.716
- We were set for 5:30,

13:38.784 --> 13:40.318
But he hit
that traffic hernia

13:40.386 --> 13:41.319
On west broadway.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.420
- Traffic hernia.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.322
What was the meeting about?
Can I ask?

13:44.390 --> 13:46.524
- Three months ago my partner
and I bought this hospital.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.726
- Ooh.
Well, that's a-

13:48.794 --> 13:51.095
That's a big ticket item,
isn't it?

13:51.163 --> 13:52.630
- Please.

13:52.698 --> 13:55.066
It's not
new york presbyterian.

13:55.134 --> 13:58.269
It's 200 beds,
a small radiology department.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.538
We wanted to go over
merger guidelines with les

14:00.606 --> 14:03.007
Just to make sure we were
on the same page with h.H.R.

14:03.075 --> 14:04.909
Don't want them on your back.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.944
- It's no longer a problem,
is it?

14:07.012 --> 14:10.581
- Sorry, what, uh...
What's no longer a problem?

14:10.649 --> 14:12.583
- Secretariat.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.552
Look at this.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.888
'73 belmont, huh?

14:16.955 --> 14:21.225
He won by 31 lengths.
Big red.

14:21.293 --> 14:23.094
- You play the ponies,
dr. Silverstern?

14:23.162 --> 14:25.730
- No,
my partner shelly used to,

14:25.798 --> 14:27.632
But he just didn't have time
for it anymore.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.600
- Yeah, being a doctor.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.836
All-consuming profession.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.639
- Forensics has something.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.683
So...

14:45.751 --> 14:47.151
What am I looking at?

14:47.219 --> 14:50.021
- Well, the plate's position
on the table is wrong.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.222
Tarney was sitting here.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.757
According to the direction
of the cut marks,

14:52.825 --> 14:54.559
He had to be standing on
the opposite side of the table

14:54.626 --> 14:55.593
To make that cut.

14:55.661 --> 14:56.861
- Or someone else
did the cutting?

14:56.929 --> 14:58.062
- That's right.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.063
- Uh-huh.

14:59.131 --> 15:00.064
- That's right.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.433
So this somebody,
beforehand,

15:02.501 --> 15:05.536
Kills les tarney,

15:05.604 --> 15:07.538
And, if he was
in this position,

15:07.606 --> 15:10.108
He could have
come around here like this,

15:10.175 --> 15:11.609
Like something like that,

15:11.677 --> 15:13.911
Uh, and then made the cut

15:13.979 --> 15:16.114
Obviously from this
side of the ble,

15:16.181 --> 15:19.117
Gotten it from here,
cuts that piece,

15:19.184 --> 15:22.887
And then puts it into
dead les tarney's mouth,

15:22.955 --> 15:24.722
Works his teeth marks on it,

15:24.790 --> 15:27.425
And then shoves it down
into the back of his throat.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.061
- That's fine,
but how do you kill someone

15:30.129 --> 15:31.996
And not leave a mark?

15:32.064 --> 15:33.865
- Guillotine choke.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.366
Martial arts technique.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.935
Guillotine presses
the carotid artery.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.403
Cuts blood supply
to the brain.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.439
- And with that amount of
inderal in tarney's system,

15:41.507 --> 15:42.607
Good night.

15:42.674 --> 15:44.308
- Time to open
a grand jury on the nurse.

15:44.376 --> 15:45.510
- Julia hiken?

15:45.577 --> 15:46.878
- I read the interview.

15:46.945 --> 15:48.312
Hiken admitted the drugs
came from her.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.481
- But tarney hounded her
for the inderal.

15:50.549 --> 15:51.883
- So she claims.

15:51.950 --> 15:54.485
Think she wasn't happy
because tarney wanted out.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.654
It's in your report.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.157
Engaged to be engaged?

15:59.224 --> 16:00.158
- I disagree.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.993
I think
that les tarney's murder

16:02.060 --> 16:04.996
Was related to this meeting

16:05.063 --> 16:07.765
With doctors spring
and silverstern

16:07.833 --> 16:09.801
That, uh,
he was nervous about.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.270
- Silverstern and his partner
recently bought a hospital.

16:12.337 --> 16:13.905
That's a perfectly
legitimate reason

16:13.972 --> 16:15.506
To meet with someone
from h.H.R.

16:15.574 --> 16:16.808
- Yeah,
but there was something

16:16.875 --> 16:18.876
Far from legitimate
about that particular meeting.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.745
- When we'd finished
questioning silverstern,

16:20.813 --> 16:22.513
He looked like
he wandered out of the barrel

16:22.581 --> 16:23.681
Of a smoking gun.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.183
- Plus which
he has on his wall

16:25.250 --> 16:26.584
A big picture
of secretariat,

16:26.652 --> 16:29.520
So there's obviously
gambling in the mix somehow.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.123
- You sure it was secretariat?

16:32.191 --> 16:34.559
- What?

16:34.626 --> 16:39.764
I'm sure that julia hiken
is not a killer.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.166
- Dr. Rogers, um, inderal,

16:42.234 --> 16:44.202
Can it cause difficulty
in swallowing?

16:44.269 --> 16:45.636
- As a side effect.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.038
It's in my report.

16:47.105 --> 16:50.141
- Julia hiken admitted
stealing the drug.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.677
She admitted giving it
to les tarney.

16:52.744 --> 16:54.879
He choked on a piece of meat.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.747
Even if it was accidental.

16:56.815 --> 16:59.717
It's manslaughter.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.320
Captain.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.723
- Pick her up.

17:13.498 --> 17:14.932
- Were the two of you fighting?

17:15.000 --> 17:15.933
- No.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.167
- We talked to les' neighbors.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.970
Seems like the day
before you found him dead

17:19.037 --> 17:20.438
There was a woman shouting.

17:20.505 --> 17:22.473
- Because I fought with les
over the inderal.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.876
He was taking too much.
I warned him. I did.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.344
- Because you loved him?

17:26.411 --> 17:28.946
- Yes.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.449
- His secretary called him
a cactus ass.

17:31.516 --> 17:35.253
- Les had zero people skills,

17:35.320 --> 17:36.721
But he was kind.

17:36.788 --> 17:38.723
He had a good side.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.595
I told you the truth.

17:44.663 --> 17:45.997
I didn't have to.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.465
Why am I going to jail?

17:47.532 --> 17:51.602
I am a nurse.
I help people.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.472
I didn't do this!

18:16.795 --> 18:18.129
- Depiano bugged my office!

18:18.196 --> 18:19.263
- Keep it down, joel.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.132
- Keep it down?
He already heard everything!

18:21.199 --> 18:24.201
He knew tarney was blackmailing
us, and he killed him.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.637
- No. I can't believe
he would ever do that.

18:26.705 --> 18:29.473
- Why? Because you share an
ivy-league handshake with him?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.509
I don't care
what you believe, shelly.

18:31.576 --> 18:32.810
The police are sweating me!

18:32.878 --> 18:34.979
- Hey, stop panicking.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.014
- Yeah?

18:37.082 --> 18:39.183
Check your office, shelly.

18:44.189 --> 18:47.491
- Thank you.

18:47.559 --> 18:49.560
- This morning the doorman from
the building across the street

18:49.628 --> 18:50.861
Told us he saw julia hiken

18:50.929 --> 18:53.798
Leave her place around
8:45 the night tarney died.

18:53.865 --> 18:54.966
- Yeah,
and judging by the way

18:55.033 --> 18:57.268
That guy was looking you
up and down,

18:57.336 --> 19:00.037
He probably got a-
got a good look at julia.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.340
- If he did and he was
right about the time,

19:02.407 --> 19:05.276
Then tarney was already dead
when she left her place.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.511
- Julia hiken was arraigned

19:07.579 --> 19:10.514
And charged with manslaughter
and felony possession

19:10.582 --> 19:12.516
Of a controlled substance.

19:12.584 --> 19:15.519
She managed to post bail.

19:15.587 --> 19:18.856
She took a cab home.

19:18.924 --> 19:22.893
And 20 minutes ago she jumped
from a tenth-story window.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.238
So...Ahem.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.661
Tactic worked.
We sweated her.

19:54.499 --> 19:56.633
- Silver-spring
ended a partnership

19:56.701 --> 19:59.370
With an l.L.C. Called
lawn chair investment group.

19:59.404 --> 20:02.439
Business address
is listed as 237 canal street,

20:02.507 --> 20:06.810
In the tribeca
community hospital building.

20:06.878 --> 20:10.147
Principal investors are
a dominic fabrigazi jr.,

20:10.215 --> 20:12.783
Anthony blevins,
theodore viviano,

20:12.851 --> 20:15.486
Annalisa gentilo,
and henry depiano.

20:15.553 --> 20:17.087
- What was the last name
on the list?

20:17.155 --> 20:19.456
- Henry depiano.

20:19.524 --> 20:21.592
- That's mag depiano's son.

20:21.659 --> 20:23.360
- Who's mag depiano?

20:23.428 --> 20:24.962
- He has a franchise
of gentleman's clubs,

20:25.029 --> 20:28.632
And owns a lot of heroin
from myanmar.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.167
- So mag's a thug,

20:30.235 --> 20:31.769
And his son buys a hospital.

20:31.836 --> 20:33.837
One of his doctor partners
bets the horses.

20:33.905 --> 20:36.640
Tarney comes poking around,
chokes on a steak.

20:36.708 --> 20:40.210
Maybe mag was the one
who cut tarney's meat for him.

20:40.278 --> 20:41.211
- Doubtful.

20:41.279 --> 20:42.780
He's in rikers.

20:42.847 --> 20:46.183
Serving 18 months for possession
of a concealed weapon.

20:48.253 --> 20:52.122
- The apple falls
not far from the tree?

20:52.190 --> 20:55.325
Henry's an orange.

20:55.393 --> 20:58.162
We haven't spoken
since his mother died of cancer.

20:58.229 --> 21:01.165
- And you have no idea where he
is, what he does for a living?

21:01.232 --> 21:03.467
- Of course I do.
He's my son.

21:03.535 --> 21:08.038
He got a place
out in queens by the water.

21:08.106 --> 21:11.041
He sweet-talked some friends
to invest in a hospital.

21:11.109 --> 21:12.509
- You don't approve?

21:12.577 --> 21:13.510
- I've seen his I.Q.

21:13.578 --> 21:15.379
Henry's a smart boy.

21:15.447 --> 21:17.848
He's wasting
his god-given talent.

21:17.916 --> 21:20.217
- Yeah, he could be serving
18 months

21:20.285 --> 21:22.052
For possession
of a concealed weapon.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.022
- Ticky-tack charge.

21:25.089 --> 21:26.924
- You've had visits
from annie gentilo

21:26.991 --> 21:29.126
And dom fabrigazi.

21:29.194 --> 21:30.527
You talk
to your son's friends?

21:30.595 --> 21:32.563
- They were my friends first.

21:32.630 --> 21:35.766
They wanted my blessing
in that hospital nonsense.

21:35.834 --> 21:37.167
What was I gonna say?

21:37.235 --> 21:40.204
- Nothing worse than hard work
and an honest investment?

21:40.271 --> 21:41.338
- Hard work.

21:41.406 --> 21:43.373
Lot of good it did.

21:43.441 --> 21:46.477
Couple days ago
poor dom collapsed.

21:46.544 --> 21:48.078
- Collapsed?

21:48.146 --> 21:51.415
- He should have
stayed retired.

21:51.483 --> 21:54.451
Henry knew dom
had heart problems.

21:59.023 --> 22:02.259
- Yeah, compared to how your
father's living, this is, uh,

22:02.327 --> 22:04.394
It's such
nice office decoration.

22:04.462 --> 22:05.562
It's kind of-

22:05.630 --> 22:09.032
Kind of a freud
rooms with marcus welby vibe.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.002
Uh, shame about
dom fabrigazi.

22:12.070 --> 22:13.837
He's, what?
One of your business partners?

22:13.905 --> 22:15.239
- Uh, and a close friend.

22:15.306 --> 22:17.941
- Did fabrigazi have
a history of heart problems?

22:18.009 --> 22:19.977
- Does.
But his regular specialist

22:20.044 --> 22:21.345
Is treating him here, so...

22:21.412 --> 22:22.779
- Do you know
if he takes anything?

22:22.847 --> 22:24.448
- Does he take anything?

22:24.516 --> 22:26.183
- Yeah,
you know, medication.

22:26.251 --> 22:27.384
- I'm sure that he does,

22:27.452 --> 22:31.088
But that would really be
a question for his m.D.

22:31.155 --> 22:33.123
- Okay.

22:33.191 --> 22:34.157
What is that?

22:34.225 --> 22:36.793
Look at that.
Wow.

22:36.861 --> 22:39.229
It's a gold st-

22:39.297 --> 22:40.364
Oh, no, it's gold plated.

22:40.431 --> 22:43.033
- It's a gift
from my partners.

22:45.637 --> 22:47.638
- Oh, here we go.
Anything?

22:47.705 --> 22:52.342
- Loud and clear.

22:53.678 --> 22:56.747
Mr. Depiano, did you know
who les tarney was?

22:56.814 --> 22:58.916
- Yeah.
Yeah, I heard about him.

22:58.983 --> 23:00.984
He's the health
and human resources guy

23:01.052 --> 23:02.286
That recently died.

23:02.353 --> 23:04.187
- Few hours before
mr. Tarney's death,

23:04.255 --> 23:06.757
He met with
dr. Joel silverstern.

23:06.824 --> 23:08.625
Were you aware of that?

23:08.693 --> 23:12.930
- No.
Joel never mentioned it.

23:14.532 --> 23:16.366
- All right,
well, uh, goodbye.

23:16.434 --> 23:17.968
- Hang on.

23:18.036 --> 23:19.469
Les tarney died
this last Monday

23:19.537 --> 23:20.604
Between 7:00 and 8:00 p.M.

23:20.672 --> 23:21.705
Can you recall where you were?

23:21.773 --> 23:24.474
- I was at home.

23:24.542 --> 23:25.943
Barbecuing.

23:26.010 --> 23:28.178
- Was there anyone with you
who could verify that?

23:28.246 --> 23:29.413
- I'm trying to go see him.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.015
- Oh, you were with
dom fabrigazi?

23:32.083 --> 23:36.320
- He brought the salmon.

23:36.387 --> 23:39.590
- Mr. Fabrigazi, when your
myocardial infarction began,

23:39.657 --> 23:41.758
Did you have
any medication with you?

23:41.826 --> 23:44.294
- This is not chicken kiev.

23:44.362 --> 23:47.331
Yeah.
I had my digoxin capsules.

23:47.398 --> 23:48.332
- Did you take any of 'em?

23:48.399 --> 23:50.534
- Tried. Why?

23:50.602 --> 23:52.369
- The night
of your heart failure,

23:52.437 --> 23:54.972
A capsule of digoxin
was found in les tarney's home.

23:55.039 --> 23:56.673
And tarney didn't have
heart problems.

23:56.741 --> 23:58.108
We want to know
how it got there.

23:58.176 --> 23:59.309
- Why don't you ask him?

23:59.377 --> 24:01.345
- 'cause he's dead.

24:01.412 --> 24:04.381
You say you tried
to get at your digoxin?

24:04.449 --> 24:06.817
- Yeah, I couldn't get that
childproof cap off, you know?

24:06.884 --> 24:09.119
Next thing I know, I'm face up
in a hospital gurney.

24:09.187 --> 24:12.656
- Henry depiano says
that when your heart failed

24:12.724 --> 24:14.224
You were at his house.

24:14.292 --> 24:16.827
You brought by a couple of
steaks to grill, or-?

24:16.894 --> 24:19.496
- Salmon.
Salmon steaks.

24:19.564 --> 24:20.964
- Did he call an ambulance?

24:21.032 --> 24:22.132
- No,
he piled me in his car,

24:22.200 --> 24:23.667
And he ran every red light
on the way here.

24:23.735 --> 24:25.302
He saved my life,

24:25.370 --> 24:28.472
Not waiting around
for them drag-ass paramedics.

24:28.539 --> 24:29.673
- Oh.

24:29.741 --> 24:31.675
It's a shame
that nobodyhwas there

24:31.743 --> 24:33.377
To save les tarney's life.

24:33.444 --> 24:35.445
Unless there was
somebody there

24:35.513 --> 24:37.948
With the job of killing him.

24:40.018 --> 24:42.319
- I'm retired, detective.

24:45.923 --> 24:48.291
- 'kay.

24:48.359 --> 24:53.096
Well, bona fortuna.

24:53.164 --> 24:56.466
- Oh, hey, you take
a bribe, detective?

24:56.534 --> 25:01.038
I'll give you five grand
for a plate of ossobuco.

25:01.105 --> 25:03.507
- Told you
we weren't gonna be long.

25:10.682 --> 25:12.616
I screwed up, henry.
They're on to me.

25:12.684 --> 25:15.118
- Your heart's screwed up.
Not you.

25:15.186 --> 25:19.723
- I feel like I slid down
the side of a mountain, henry.

25:19.791 --> 25:22.359
- I never should have
gotten you involved in this.

25:22.427 --> 25:25.362
You ought to be
on a beach in miami.

25:25.430 --> 25:28.632
- What, and be like
one of them old farts, huh?

25:28.700 --> 25:30.967
That drives around
with their turn signal

25:31.035 --> 25:32.302
Blinking for miles and miles?

25:32.370 --> 25:34.671
Come on, henry.

25:34.739 --> 25:38.008
If I kick, who's gonna
brag about you to your old man?

25:38.076 --> 25:40.143
Huh?

25:40.211 --> 25:44.081
All right. Okay.

25:44.148 --> 25:47.384
Okay.

25:54.358 --> 25:55.859
- You think I planted these?

25:55.927 --> 25:57.961
- Henry.

25:58.029 --> 26:00.130
- Why would I bug your office,
joel?

26:00.198 --> 26:02.632
- Because you don't trust us.

26:02.700 --> 26:06.002
- Why? Because my last name
ends with an "o"?

26:06.070 --> 26:08.205
Like gambino?

26:08.272 --> 26:10.140
Or maybe you're confusing me
with my father.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.609
- Look, joel, henry just got
a little overzealous.

26:12.677 --> 26:14.111
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:14.178 --> 26:16.279
Maybe you were keeping tabs
on shelly's gambling problem.

26:16.347 --> 26:17.581
I don't know. I don't care.

26:17.648 --> 26:19.616
- Gambling problem?
Told me that was over, shelly.

26:19.684 --> 26:21.651
- It is.
It is.

26:21.719 --> 26:23.787
- These people that
I brought in as my partners,

26:23.855 --> 26:24.888
They're retired.

26:24.956 --> 26:26.323
They live
off of their investments.

26:26.390 --> 26:28.625
- I haven't looked at a racing
form in over two years.

26:28.693 --> 26:30.160
It's the god's honest truth.

26:30.228 --> 26:31.461
- They're my friends, shelly.

26:31.529 --> 26:33.897
I told them that this
is a clean investment.

26:33.965 --> 26:35.465
Nothing illegal.

26:35.533 --> 26:37.267
You gave me your word.

26:37.335 --> 26:38.969
- I know that.

26:39.036 --> 26:44.674
I know that.

26:44.742 --> 26:48.945
- What?

26:49.013 --> 26:52.482
- I've decided
to refocus on the clinic.

26:52.550 --> 26:54.384
- Refocus?

26:54.452 --> 26:56.386
- Shelly's-
shelly's buying me out.

26:56.454 --> 27:00.657
I'm moving on.

27:00.725 --> 27:04.060
- No, you're not.

27:04.128 --> 27:05.395
- I'm set on this, henry.

27:05.463 --> 27:06.596
- Well, get unset.

27:06.664 --> 27:08.431
We have a signed deal
in place.

27:08.499 --> 27:10.100
- With a morals
and disclosures clause,

27:10.168 --> 27:12.402
Which I'll use if I have to.

27:51.342 --> 27:53.977
- Let's get out of here.

28:03.586 --> 28:05.587
- Remember the picture
in my office?

28:05.655 --> 28:07.489
- Yeah, secretariat.

28:07.557 --> 28:08.657
What happened?

28:08.724 --> 28:10.725
Your partner started
to take short odds

28:10.793 --> 28:13.161
On closers at aqueduct again?

28:13.229 --> 28:14.262
- No.

28:14.330 --> 28:16.498
Shelly stayed away.

28:16.566 --> 28:18.533
What he didn't do
was inform me

28:18.601 --> 28:20.402
He'd been claiming
his track losses

28:20.469 --> 28:22.938
On his personal
income filing.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.273
When it came time to secure
a loan for the hospital,

28:25.341 --> 28:27.976
The lending institutions
ran the other way.

28:28.044 --> 28:30.212
- So shelly ran
to henry depiano,

28:30.279 --> 28:31.413
His college pal.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.948
- His pal.

28:33.015 --> 28:37.252
He was bugging our offices.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.386
Don't look at me like that.

28:38.454 --> 28:40.789
I have the devices.
I'll show you.

28:40.857 --> 28:43.391
This was a beat-down
from henry depiano

28:43.459 --> 28:44.426
Because I wanted out.

28:44.493 --> 28:47.462
- You'll testify?

28:47.530 --> 28:50.732
- I want protection.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.167
You have to protect me.

28:52.235 --> 28:56.171
These-these people,
they're-they're animals.

28:56.239 --> 28:57.439
- Henry depiano.

28:57.506 --> 29:00.508
He had joel silverstern
worked over to get him to stay.

29:00.576 --> 29:01.509
- Yeah? Why?

29:01.577 --> 29:03.245
- If silverstern bails,

29:03.312 --> 29:04.846
Henry's investors
might do the same.

29:04.914 --> 29:06.548
The beat-down was a message-
don't leave.

29:06.616 --> 29:08.016
- Yeah, but why
the mixed signals?

29:08.084 --> 29:10.051
What is the point
of taking silverstern's wallet?

29:10.119 --> 29:12.020
Maybe silverstern
really was mugged.

29:12.088 --> 29:14.122
- Well, then why
aren't the muggers

29:14.190 --> 29:17.025
Tooling around in his
$120,000 maserati?

29:17.093 --> 29:18.894
Why take 100 bucks
in cash and credit cards

29:18.961 --> 29:19.928
And not the car?

29:19.996 --> 29:21.296
- The panic button
scared them off.

29:21.364 --> 29:22.831
You're thinking
with your heart, zach.

29:22.899 --> 29:27.402
- No, I'm thinking with
dom fabrigazi's heart.

29:27.470 --> 29:29.571
They found digoxin
at the murder.

29:29.639 --> 29:31.740
Dom has a prescription
for digoxin.

29:31.807 --> 29:33.775
- Yeah, along with
the other half million

29:33.843 --> 29:35.543
People in manhattan
who have heart disease.

29:35.611 --> 29:36.945
You know,
I want to get this guy too,

29:37.013 --> 29:38.713
But you got to give me
something to go on here.

29:38.781 --> 29:40.081
- Fabrigazi suffers a coronary

29:40.149 --> 29:41.383
The same time les tarney

29:41.450 --> 29:44.519
Bites on a single piece
of steak and chokes to death?

29:44.587 --> 29:46.755
- Juries don't convict
on coincidence.

29:46.822 --> 29:48.823
- Yeah.
What if killing tarney

29:48.891 --> 29:50.825
Was a strain
on fabrigazi's heart?

29:50.893 --> 29:52.294
Suppose he felt sick,

29:52.361 --> 29:53.895
Took a pill,
inadvertently dropped one?

29:53.963 --> 29:56.264
- Okay.
Fabrigazi's prints on file

29:56.332 --> 29:58.767
Didn't match the prints
found on the capsule.

29:58.834 --> 30:02.003
- Like there's not
a silicon valley geek out there,

30:02.071 --> 30:04.139
Unemployed, who, you know,

30:04.206 --> 30:05.607
For the sake
of covering his mortgage

30:05.675 --> 30:07.676
Couldn't be talked
into hacking into the system

30:07.743 --> 30:09.044
And falsifying
a set of prints?

30:09.111 --> 30:11.813
- There's a complete absence
of probable cause here.

30:11.881 --> 30:14.149
A tea-party judge
wouldn't grant you permission

30:14.216 --> 30:16.184
To fingerprint
dominic fabrigazi.

30:16.252 --> 30:18.119
You want to play what if?

30:18.187 --> 30:20.689
What if silverstern's
lying his ass off?

30:20.756 --> 30:21.690
Huh?

30:21.757 --> 30:23.325
What if he's lying his ass off?

30:23.392 --> 30:24.693
He comes crying to the police

30:24.760 --> 30:27.829
About his head being put
in a vise, and you believe him.

30:27.897 --> 30:28.830
Of course.

30:28.898 --> 30:30.332
Because
it's the garlic eaters.

30:30.399 --> 30:31.599
The guys with the shiny ties.

30:31.667 --> 30:32.600
The wise guys from...

30:32.668 --> 30:33.868
- Hey, hey, hold on.
Hold on.

30:33.936 --> 30:35.870
Neither of these detectives
is remotely bigoted.

30:35.938 --> 30:38.907
- Hear, hear. Some of my
best collars have been italian.

30:38.975 --> 30:40.809
- Not funny, zach.

30:40.876 --> 30:42.677
- It's okay, captain.
I know he's joking.

30:42.745 --> 30:45.246
I get a little nuts about
the way italian-americans

30:45.314 --> 30:46.815
Are portrayed in this city.

30:46.882 --> 30:49.718
But I can't ask for a warrant
based on hearsay.

30:49.785 --> 30:51.419
- Can't or won't?

30:51.487 --> 30:52.954
- How could your dad
be such a good guy

30:53.022 --> 30:54.489
And you're such a hard-ass?

30:54.557 --> 30:56.992
- Roy, those people in h.H.R.,

30:57.059 --> 30:58.526
Are they sleeping better now

30:58.594 --> 31:00.929
That an innocent woman
has jumped to her death?

31:00.997 --> 31:03.498
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

31:03.566 --> 31:05.600
- Whoa. It's got
to be done right, zach.

31:05.668 --> 31:06.601
You should know that.

31:06.669 --> 31:07.602
- Get him out of here.
Go!

31:07.670 --> 31:09.237
- Stop.

31:14.710 --> 31:18.880
Brought you a decaf.

31:18.948 --> 31:21.449
- Gee, this father thing
keeps bugging me.

31:21.517 --> 31:23.251
- Honestly?

31:23.319 --> 31:24.719
Dell getty's a real boil,

31:24.787 --> 31:26.388
But you should let go of it.

31:26.455 --> 31:29.457
- No, I meant henry's father.

31:29.525 --> 31:31.960
The whole thing just, uh...

31:32.028 --> 31:36.831
Somehow feels familiar.

31:36.899 --> 31:38.266
Here we go.

31:38.334 --> 31:40.435
A key witness in the state's
murder-extortion case

31:40.503 --> 31:42.037
Against alleged crime boss

31:42.104 --> 31:44.806
Magglio depiano was found dead
early Sunday evening.

31:44.874 --> 31:46.541
An anonymous source
revealed to the ledger

31:46.609 --> 31:48.343
That darius prefontaine

31:48.411 --> 31:51.046
Accidentally choked
on a fish bone.

31:51.113 --> 31:53.114
- Well, no wonder
it sounds familiar.

31:53.182 --> 31:54.349
They murdered the witness,

31:54.417 --> 31:56.651
Made it look like
an accidental choking.

31:56.719 --> 31:57.952
Well, that's it.

31:58.020 --> 32:00.755
Dom cleaned up henry's mess
by killing tarney,

32:00.823 --> 32:03.191
And why use anything
but tried-and-true methods?

32:03.259 --> 32:05.493
- Let's go talk to henry.

32:05.561 --> 32:07.062
- Well, hang on.

32:07.129 --> 32:08.930
This is all
terrifically revealing,

32:08.998 --> 32:10.965
But it still doesn't move us
off of square one.

32:11.033 --> 32:13.034
- Talking about dom's prints?

32:13.102 --> 32:16.304
- Without those, we get more
of the same from dell getty.

32:16.372 --> 32:20.875
- I think I got
the print thing down.

32:20.943 --> 32:22.377
- You were lucky to catch me.

32:22.445 --> 32:23.945
Just about to go home.

32:24.013 --> 32:25.747
- Hey, how's, uh...

32:25.815 --> 32:27.715
How's dominic?

32:27.783 --> 32:29.784
- They did
a double angioplasty.

32:29.852 --> 32:31.553
Thank god they didn't need
to crack him open.

32:31.620 --> 32:32.854
He's gonna be okay.

32:32.922 --> 32:35.423
- Good, good.
You know, he's going to prison.

32:35.491 --> 32:38.226
We got him, henry.

32:38.294 --> 32:39.861
- For what?

32:39.929 --> 32:41.996
- Well, les tarney
was blackmailing your partners.

32:42.064 --> 32:44.432
He had the offices tapped.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.401
We found his fingerprints
on the bugs.

32:46.469 --> 32:48.536
- So you had dom murder tarney

32:48.604 --> 32:51.206
And stage it
to look like an accident.

32:51.273 --> 32:54.742
Well, nevertheless,
hey, how about those doctors?

32:54.810 --> 32:57.946
Jeez. Did they
screw the pooch or what?

32:58.013 --> 32:59.681
- Screwed the pooch?

32:59.748 --> 33:02.517
- Yeah, you know, up-coding.

33:02.585 --> 33:05.253
- I had no knowledge
of any criminal activities

33:05.321 --> 33:07.021
Or any billing improprieties.

33:07.089 --> 33:09.023
- "I had no knowledge
of any criminal activities

33:09.091 --> 33:11.092
Or any billing improprieties."

33:11.160 --> 33:13.061
Jeez,
you work so hard at it.

33:13.129 --> 33:17.665
My golly. You're so afraid
that you're gonna be seen

33:17.733 --> 33:20.034
As a thug and a leg-breaker,

33:20.102 --> 33:21.436
You're gonna be looked upon

33:21.504 --> 33:25.106
As the lawless brute that
your old man turned out to be.

33:25.174 --> 33:29.811
- I really have no idea
what you are talking about.

33:29.879 --> 33:31.579
- Okay, henry.

33:31.647 --> 33:35.517
- Here. The duty nurse
routinely changes these

33:35.584 --> 33:37.285
When they become too soiled.

33:37.353 --> 33:39.521
Forensics can compare
the prints on this

33:39.588 --> 33:41.523
To the prints
on a digoxin capsule

33:41.590 --> 33:43.124
Found at the murder scene.

33:43.192 --> 33:47.228
- Unfortunately, we can't prove
that you ordered the hit,

33:47.296 --> 33:48.830
And dom won't give you up.

33:48.898 --> 33:51.799
He's, uh, old school.

33:51.867 --> 33:55.537
Red sauce. Omerta.
Like your father?

33:55.604 --> 33:58.139
- Dom is nothing
like my father.

33:58.207 --> 34:01.643
- Because you hate mag depiano?

34:01.710 --> 34:03.044
- What would you know about it?

34:03.112 --> 34:05.914
- Oh,
I know a little something

34:05.981 --> 34:09.484
About what it's like to have
a father who's hard to love.

34:09.552 --> 34:11.920
But as much
as I might resent mine,

34:11.987 --> 34:13.487
He helps people.

34:13.556 --> 34:16.357
Yours is a crime boss
and a killer,

34:16.425 --> 34:18.592
And you would do anything
not to be him?

34:18.661 --> 34:20.228
- You are damn right.

34:20.295 --> 34:23.498
I swore to my mother
that that would never happen.

34:23.565 --> 34:26.134
- So you let a college buddy

34:26.202 --> 34:27.835
Snow you into
making a bad investment

34:27.902 --> 34:30.103
In return for an image
of legitimacy.

34:30.172 --> 34:31.572
- Uh, it's not an image.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.341
I am legitimate.

34:33.409 --> 34:36.476
- Sure. Because dom fabrigazi
did all the dirty work.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.514
- Don't do that.

34:40.583 --> 34:44.786
Dom stuck his neck out
for you.

34:44.853 --> 34:48.322
Mag depiano wouldn't do that
for his own mother.

34:48.389 --> 34:50.225
You're right.

34:50.292 --> 34:53.027
Dom is nothing
like your father.

34:53.094 --> 34:54.562
- Neither am I.

34:54.630 --> 34:56.598
- Because this
brooks brothers suit

34:56.665 --> 34:59.634
And this inane gold
stethoscope give you respect?

34:59.702 --> 35:01.836
Is that what you think?

35:01.904 --> 35:04.872
Like you're principled now?

35:04.940 --> 35:07.208
You think you've broken
the linkage?

35:07.276 --> 35:09.777
Really?
- Yeah.

35:09.845 --> 35:14.382
- Enough to satisfy your mom?

35:14.450 --> 35:17.619
- My mother is dead.

35:17.686 --> 35:19.220
- It's a shame
she didn't live long enough

35:19.288 --> 35:22.423
To boast about her son
owning a hospital.

35:22.491 --> 35:24.125
- Well, that would have
made her happy.

35:24.193 --> 35:25.893
- She could have used
a little joy.

35:25.961 --> 35:28.896
She worried
most of her life about you.

35:28.964 --> 35:34.235
Wondering when you'd walk
in your father's footsteps.

35:34.303 --> 35:35.837
- She didn't have
to worry about that.

35:35.904 --> 35:37.272
- Maybe it's just as well

35:37.339 --> 35:38.740
She died before
she could see her son

35:38.807 --> 35:41.542
Become magglio depiano.

35:46.915 --> 35:50.118
- No.

35:50.185 --> 35:53.054
No, I-I hate him.
Remember that.

35:53.122 --> 35:57.058
- You've hated him for making
your mother sick with worry.

35:57.126 --> 36:01.929
She kept secrets,
looked the other way,

36:01.997 --> 36:04.332
Buried her suspicions
while he buried bodies,

36:04.400 --> 36:05.900
And it ate her up inside.

36:05.968 --> 36:08.036
And you've hated him
for her cancer,

36:08.103 --> 36:10.305
But not for who he is.

36:13.342 --> 36:16.277
'cause that's who you are,
henry.

36:16.345 --> 36:19.213
At least...

36:19.281 --> 36:21.249
That's who you've been.

36:28.857 --> 36:32.226
You know, if your father
knew what you did this last week

36:32.294 --> 36:34.996
And how you could
get away with it,

36:35.064 --> 36:37.999
You'd be the apple of his eye.

37:07.629 --> 37:10.998
- Dom doesn't do time.

37:11.066 --> 37:13.267
I'll tell you
what happened with tarney,

37:13.335 --> 37:16.037
But dom doesn't do time.

37:18.107 --> 37:20.375
I want your word.

37:20.442 --> 37:24.479
- It's no good.
We don't have the authority.

37:24.546 --> 37:27.415
- I want your word.

37:27.483 --> 37:30.351
- You have it.

37:32.588 --> 37:37.558
How'd you find out
about the blackmailing?

37:37.626 --> 37:39.961
- Shelly.

37:40.028 --> 37:43.331
- So you paid a visit
to tarney's.

37:43.399 --> 37:47.702
- I went to scare him
out of squeezing us.

37:47.770 --> 37:51.506
He was sitting down to eat
when we got there.

37:51.573 --> 37:53.875
- We?

37:53.942 --> 38:00.014
You and dominic fabrigazi?

38:00.082 --> 38:02.316
- I took dom along for show.

38:06.188 --> 38:09.090
And tarney
wouldn't listen to us.

38:09.158 --> 38:11.959
I asked him
to knock down the price,

38:12.027 --> 38:18.332
And he laughed at us.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.802
And I snapped.

38:20.869 --> 38:22.770
Tarney went to open the wine.

38:22.838 --> 38:25.239
I grabbed him from behind.

38:25.307 --> 38:27.675
Dom, he tried to stop me.

38:30.312 --> 38:32.046
He started panting,
stumbling.

38:32.114 --> 38:36.384
Uh, and I screamed at him,
"get back into the car."

38:36.452 --> 38:41.088
- While you finished off tarney.

38:41.156 --> 38:43.691
- Yeah.

38:47.029 --> 38:47.962
- Then what?

38:48.030 --> 38:53.234
- Went back in
and cleaned it up.

38:53.302 --> 38:56.037
I made it look
like tarney had choked.

38:58.874 --> 39:01.342
- Where'd you learn
that trick, henry?

39:05.914 --> 39:08.549
- From magglio depiano.

39:11.119 --> 39:13.387
My father.

39:24.466 --> 39:27.168
- You think they teach
choke holds at dartmouth?

39:27.236 --> 39:28.836
- The guillotine.

39:28.904 --> 39:31.539
- So henry lied
about the whole thing.

39:31.607 --> 39:33.674
You're okay with that?

39:33.742 --> 39:37.011
- Somebody had to answer
for the murder of a blackmailer.

39:37.079 --> 39:38.312
Who?

39:38.380 --> 39:42.717
A mobster with a bad heart
but a capacity for good,

39:42.784 --> 39:45.853
Or a kid who'd never known
the meaning of the word "good"?

39:45.921 --> 39:48.456
- Until now.

39:48.524 --> 39:50.725
- How'd you get
to henry depiano?

39:50.792 --> 39:53.127
- Misled him into believing

39:53.195 --> 39:56.797
That we had dominic fabrigazi's
fingerprints.

39:56.865 --> 39:58.666
- Perfectly
within the guidelines.

39:58.734 --> 40:03.404
- And I promised henry
that dom wouldn't do time.

40:03.472 --> 40:05.573
- You did?

40:05.641 --> 40:08.676
Who died and made you
district attorney?

40:08.744 --> 40:10.878
- Julia hiken.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.617
- Depiano.

40:16.685 --> 40:18.286
We just got a call
from the hospital.

40:18.353 --> 40:20.454
Dominic fabrigazi's
been released,

40:20.522 --> 40:24.492
And I will personally make sure
he's brought up on charges.
