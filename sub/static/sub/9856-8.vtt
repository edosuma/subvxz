00:43.261 --> 00:45.021
- Are we nearly there?
- I think so.

00:45.141 --> 00:47.557
What do you mean "think so"? You
don't know how far away we are?

00:47.581 --> 00:48.581
Only because...

00:49.261 --> 00:51.341
I don't know where we're
going, I don't remember.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.101
Oh, my God. I don't either!

00:55.461 --> 00:56.741
I'm so knackered!

00:57.101 --> 00:58.301
The club!

00:58.701 --> 01:00.701
The club! We're going to the club!

01:00.861 --> 01:02.741
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the club. Which club?

01:05.741 --> 01:07.501
Wendy, you're bleeding!

01:07.661 --> 01:08.661
I am?

01:09.021 --> 01:11.301
- Oh, my God, Nigel!
- I'm bleeding.

01:11.981 --> 01:13.381
I think I'm going to be...

01:14.261 --> 01:15.261
Shit!

01:20.341 --> 01:21.421
Make a wish.

01:24.341 --> 01:26.622
- What did you wish for?
- If you say, it won't come true.

01:26.741 --> 01:28.821
Too late, you lot are all still here.

01:28.941 --> 01:30.261
Only because it's working hours.

01:30.461 --> 01:31.741
We were going to use 30 candles,

01:31.821 --> 01:34.701
but the fire department has
rules against that much open fire.

01:35.021 --> 01:36.637
Yeah, they'd have to be waiting with a hose

01:36.661 --> 01:37.997
in case you couldn't get the job done.

01:38.021 --> 01:40.221
No McConnell's ever had any
trouble getting a job done.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.781
Why does everything you say sound dirty?

01:43.021 --> 01:45.421
Your mind makes it that way.
It's the way you think about me.

01:45.541 --> 01:46.901
Yeah, you wish.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.221
This better be good, Dougie.

02:02.341 --> 02:05.301
I just left a woman with questionable
morals and an astounding imagination.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.461
We were called to investigate
a traffic accident.

02:08.781 --> 02:10.300
Did you say "traffic accident"?

02:10.461 --> 02:12.061
Yes, sir. Three fatalities.

02:12.541 --> 02:14.541
Well, I assume there's
more to the story than that?

02:14.621 --> 02:16.021
The accident didn't kill them.

02:16.781 --> 02:17.781
Lead on.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.661
Can you send them all home now, please?

02:25.941 --> 02:27.141
You are not having fun?

02:27.341 --> 02:29.061
My people aren't big birthday folk.

02:29.381 --> 02:30.981
You do not celebrate your birthday?

02:31.181 --> 02:32.581
More like counted them down.

02:32.741 --> 02:34.341
When we were kids, my Da would remind us

02:34.381 --> 02:36.941
that every birthday brought us
closer to being charged as adults.

02:37.101 --> 02:38.341
You are serious?

02:38.501 --> 02:39.861
When theft is the family business,

02:39.981 --> 02:42.021
knowing when you "come of
age" is an important fact.

02:42.341 --> 02:44.141
So can you send them home? Please?

02:44.341 --> 02:45.901
Could you wait long enough for this?

02:46.261 --> 02:47.461
Everybody pitched in.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.021
You got me a gift?

02:56.941 --> 02:57.941
It's heavy.

02:58.421 --> 02:59.821
Come on, open it up.

03:00.021 --> 03:02.061
Oh, you're not one of those, are you?

03:02.581 --> 03:03.941
Come on, tear it, tear it.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.861
Ta-da.

03:16.341 --> 03:18.421
Fresh off the Heckler
and Koch factory floor.

03:18.581 --> 03:20.541
Hand engraved. What do you say?

03:23.901 --> 03:25.061
She's, uh...

03:25.981 --> 03:26.981
beautiful.

03:27.021 --> 03:29.181
The Germans do know their weaponry.

03:30.101 --> 03:32.181
They also make an
excellent grenade launcher,

03:32.301 --> 03:34.501
but we thought that was
more a Christmas thing.

03:35.581 --> 03:36.621
It's perfect.

03:36.941 --> 03:38.541
I'll show you how to use it later.

03:39.421 --> 03:41.861
I wanted to teach you a few
things on the range, anyway, so...

03:42.261 --> 03:43.781
There's one more thing.

03:44.421 --> 03:46.421
It's not new, it's used.

03:46.781 --> 03:49.501
It's been mine for years, but I checked,

03:49.861 --> 03:52.181
and it fits your new
pistol. Happy birthday.

03:57.461 --> 03:58.461
Just...

03:58.541 --> 04:00.861
just excuse me for a minute,
I'm just going to go to the...

04:01.421 --> 04:02.661
go to the bathroom...

04:03.101 --> 04:04.141
Is he reallyy?

04:04.501 --> 04:06.181
Is he...? I think so.

04:06.661 --> 04:08.541
Ah, damn, we should have taken a picture.

04:08.701 --> 04:09.701
We still can.

04:09.781 --> 04:11.117
- I've got my phone.
- I'll hold the door.

04:11.141 --> 04:12.717
- You want to do it?
- Yeah, yeah, I wanna do it.

04:12.741 --> 04:14.037
This is gonna go on the bulletin board.

04:14.061 --> 04:15.141
It's gonna go everywhere.

04:16.101 --> 04:17.421
They all ingested drugs,

04:17.861 --> 04:19.861
and there are five more
cases just in this E.R.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.701
- Dead?
- One.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.181
Two knocking on the door,

04:23.461 --> 04:24.661
and across the city,

04:25.461 --> 04:27.742
we're hearing there may be as
many as a hundred kids sick.

04:28.501 --> 04:29.541
Very sick.

04:31.781 --> 04:32.941
This blood,

04:34.221 --> 04:35.781
it doesn't look like overdose.

04:37.461 --> 04:38.741
It looks like poison.

04:38.941 --> 04:41.061
Right, I want autopsies
immediately on all these kids,

04:41.141 --> 04:42.581
toxicology at triple-time.

04:47.381 --> 04:48.381
Imogen?

04:48.501 --> 04:49.997
Get hold of Metro Narcotics, will you,

04:50.021 --> 04:51.701
and tell them to start spreading the word.

04:52.061 --> 04:54.381
There's a bad batch of something
that just hit the streets.

04:54.581 --> 04:57.061
We have four fatalities, and
God knows how many more to come.

04:57.181 --> 04:58.901
Oh, and connect me with
the Mayor, will you?

04:59.221 --> 05:00.501
Yeah, I know, I know.

05:00.861 --> 05:03.261
Tell him I'm sorry it's
late, but we have a situation.

05:04.781 --> 05:08.101
A very, very serious situation.

05:41.061 --> 05:42.741
All told, there are 16 dead,

05:42.981 --> 05:44.581
10 that are extremely critical,

05:44.741 --> 05:46.701
and 40 more are still in hospital.

05:46.901 --> 05:48.221
66 victims?

05:48.501 --> 05:51.501
There was a time when I feared
that it would actually be more.

05:51.661 --> 05:52.941
And you don't know what it is?

05:53.221 --> 05:54.541
We know it's cocaine based.

05:54.781 --> 05:56.197
The victims that would admit to taking it

05:56.221 --> 05:57.581
said that's what they bought,

05:57.821 --> 05:59.101
but as for the toxin, no.

05:59.301 --> 06:00.501
So, how can we help you?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.637
Our narcotics boys found
that there was a new shipment

06:02.661 --> 06:04.101
dumped on the street last week.

06:04.261 --> 06:05.501
It came from the Balkans

06:05.661 --> 06:08.061
via a smuggling route through
Paris, and ultimately Calais,

06:08.221 --> 06:09.781
before crossing the channel to Dover.

06:09.941 --> 06:12.061
There's a new shipment on its way now.

06:12.661 --> 06:15.221
There's... there's no telling
how many more would die.

06:15.901 --> 06:18.181
Ongoing, cross-border, and organized.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.301
I believe we can get authorization.

06:20.501 --> 06:23.861
I also hoped McConnell could come
over and help us here in the U.K.

06:24.141 --> 06:25.181
For what?

06:25.341 --> 06:26.821
A number of the victims were Irish.

06:27.061 --> 06:28.781
Some of them are hesitant to talk.

06:28.941 --> 06:30.301
Tommy might put them at ease.

06:30.461 --> 06:32.021
If the Major doesn't mind, I don't.

06:34.541 --> 06:35.581
It's a good idea.

06:35.821 --> 06:37.421
Right. So, we're a go then?

06:37.581 --> 06:39.421
I will need to talk to your narcotics team

06:39.781 --> 06:41.581
and get the information on Calais.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.021
I don't want to go in blind.

06:43.221 --> 06:44.981
We will do our own investigation.

06:45.981 --> 06:47.101
Complete autonomy.

06:47.301 --> 06:49.821
Can we start with a list of all
the victims, living and dead?

06:50.021 --> 06:52.221
Of course. Anything else?

06:52.541 --> 06:53.701
Not at the moment.

06:53.941 --> 06:55.461
I'll see you soon, McConnell.

06:56.341 --> 06:58.661
So, Tommy, chopper to London,

06:58.981 --> 07:01.341
the rest of us, on a train to Calais.

07:01.541 --> 07:04.221
That sounds like a musical.
"The Train to Calais."

07:07.381 --> 07:08.421
Tommy...

07:09.501 --> 07:10.821
Hold on a second, Louis.

07:12.021 --> 07:15.461
All of a sudden, Lennon's talking to
you like you guys are best friends.

07:15.621 --> 07:18.141
I mean, am I the only one whose
bullshit meter is going up here?

07:18.221 --> 07:20.517
Maybe he's come around. We've
been through a few things now.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.637
He strike you as the kind of
guy who can change on a dime?

07:22.661 --> 07:24.717
Well, even if he hasn't
changed, I can handle myself.

07:24.741 --> 07:25.901
I have no doubt about that,

07:26.061 --> 07:27.821
but I still think you
should go with back-up.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.101
I appreciate it, mate,
but you were at the party.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.381
I'm 30 now. I'm all grown up.

07:36.261 --> 07:37.781
Hickman wants to protect me.

07:37.981 --> 07:38.981
From what?

07:39.181 --> 07:41.221
The evil empire, the British one.

07:41.781 --> 07:43.501
I told him I'd be just fine, thank you.

07:43.701 --> 07:44.981
I'll meet you outside.

07:45.781 --> 07:46.861
What's with her?

07:47.181 --> 07:48.941
She baked the cupcakes for us.

07:49.141 --> 07:50.141
And?

07:50.381 --> 07:52.901
She found yours in the
fridge this morning. Uneaten.

07:53.101 --> 07:54.661
I told you I'm not much a birthday guy.

07:54.781 --> 07:56.277
Well, you asked what was wrong with her.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.301
You should apologize.

07:57.461 --> 07:59.277
Why do I end up having
to apologize for something

07:59.301 --> 08:00.741
I didn't ask for or want?

08:00.941 --> 08:02.141
Just eat the cupcake.

08:02.301 --> 08:03.621
Now, that'd feel like giving in.

08:03.741 --> 08:04.861
Eat the cupcake.

08:13.341 --> 08:14.461
Chief Inspector?

08:15.221 --> 08:17.181
Two more of the drug
kids died this morning.

08:22.261 --> 08:23.781
Time to get this sorted,

08:24.541 --> 08:25.781
once and for all.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.621
Nice office.

08:42.861 --> 08:44.341
- Chief Inspector?
- Thanks, Imogen.

08:44.781 --> 08:47.381
- I'm not in it much.
- Not much of a desk jockey, eh?

08:47.661 --> 08:49.277
The field is where I feel more comfortable.

08:49.301 --> 08:50.981
Yeah, well, you and I have that in common.

08:51.021 --> 08:52.701
Well, if that's true, it's the only thing.

08:53.341 --> 08:54.341
How's that?

08:54.861 --> 08:57.581
I can't imagine having anything
else in common with the likes of you.

08:57.901 --> 08:59.461
- The likes of me?
- Yeah,

08:59.741 --> 09:02.141
a filthy pikey son of a bitch
whose family flooded my streets

09:02.301 --> 09:03.941
with poison and killed 18 young people.

09:04.141 --> 09:05.661
You think my family did this?

09:05.781 --> 09:07.541
And you're going to
help me bring them down,

09:07.901 --> 09:09.141
one way or another.

09:10.285 --> 09:12.205
My family has nothing to do with drugs.

09:12.325 --> 09:14.205
- Bollocks.
- Never have and never will.

09:14.802 --> 09:17.178
I've had that wanker brother of
yours in my lock-up a dozen times,

09:17.202 --> 09:19.498
higher than a kite. Real salt of
the earth family man, that one.

09:19.522 --> 09:22.242
I don't dispute he was pissed or
on gear, but we don't deal drugs.

09:22.402 --> 09:24.498
All it takes is needing a fix one
night, and not having the money,

09:24.522 --> 09:27.362
and you're a dealer. And that shite
caravan camp your family calls home

09:27.522 --> 09:29.162
is a perfect place to do it from, too.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.522
Police don't even want to
go there for fear of disease.

09:31.682 --> 09:34.482
Maybe if you lot weren't so afraid,
you'd start to see us as people.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.802
Oh, not bloody likely.

09:35.962 --> 09:38.882
Your brother killed 18
Brits, and he is gonna pay!

09:39.082 --> 09:41.722
Spend as much time as you like
on him, but Colin's not your man.

09:43.602 --> 09:45.898
Can I count on you to act like
a copper instead of a Traveller,

09:45.922 --> 09:46.762
and help me?

09:46.922 --> 09:48.642
How'd you say it? "Not bloody likely."

09:50.842 --> 09:52.802
And... we're off.

09:53.562 --> 09:54.762
I've never been here.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.282
It's easy to see how it
became a big smuggling spot.

09:58.282 --> 09:59.562
It's like a perfect set up.

09:59.762 --> 10:02.602
There is always something crossing
to the U.K. or back from here.

10:05.562 --> 10:07.882
- Good morning, Thierry.
- Major Daniel. Long time.

10:08.082 --> 10:09.242
Yes, a long time.

10:09.882 --> 10:12.122
This is Hickman. Part of
my team from The Hague.

10:12.242 --> 10:13.642
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You, too.

10:14.122 --> 10:15.402
And the rest of the team.

10:18.162 --> 10:21.522
We want to talk about some drugs
coming out of Calais into the U.K.

10:21.962 --> 10:23.722
The current smuggling
route is further east.

10:23.882 --> 10:26.722
There was a shipment of bad
dope into London a few days ago.

10:27.602 --> 10:28.762
A lot of users died.

10:28.922 --> 10:30.002
We heard about it.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.242
British narcotics thinks it
originated through Calais.

10:33.762 --> 10:35.322
Well, they're usually better than that.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.722
Calais has been a
well-travelled smuggling port,

10:37.922 --> 10:39.322
but not for some time.

10:39.482 --> 10:41.282
We've had it locked for
more than six months.

10:41.482 --> 10:42.522
Are you sure?

10:42.762 --> 10:45.242
Sometimes I think we have more
cops in Calais than civilians.

10:45.922 --> 10:47.922
You got petrol at a station a mile back?

10:48.282 --> 10:50.322
60 litres and 50 litres?

10:50.562 --> 10:51.802
How do you know that?

10:52.122 --> 10:54.642
The station keeper is
my old partner, Gerard.

10:54.962 --> 10:56.802
Nothing moves though
Calais without us knowing.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.442
How could the Met have it so wrong?

10:58.802 --> 11:00.362
Actually, according to our sources,

11:00.522 --> 11:03.322
your bad cocaine came from a
different direction all together.

11:04.002 --> 11:05.202
From Northern Ireland,

11:05.442 --> 11:07.442
and then down through the
boroughs north of London.

11:50.462 --> 11:51.582
You need some help?

11:54.222 --> 11:55.342
Fold laundry?

11:55.622 --> 11:56.782
Aye, I could.

11:57.742 --> 11:59.462
Is that what men do where you're from?

12:00.302 --> 12:01.462
I'm from here.

12:02.862 --> 12:03.862
No.

12:04.262 --> 12:06.302
No, you're not. Not anymore.

12:06.502 --> 12:08.062
A thing like that doesn't change.

12:08.262 --> 12:09.982
"Where a man is born is just a fact.

12:10.182 --> 12:11.982
Where a man is from is
a whole 'nother thing."

12:12.142 --> 12:14.078
And that was the toast
your Da gave at our wedding.

12:14.102 --> 12:15.862
He was talking about me at your wedding?

12:16.262 --> 12:17.462
That's interesting.

12:17.662 --> 12:19.742
Oh, a lot of us were talking
about Tommy McConnell,

12:20.222 --> 12:22.582
right up until he offered
his gift as a bounty on you.

12:23.062 --> 12:25.302
As your wedding gift? That must've hurt.

12:25.622 --> 12:26.902
It was my idea.

12:28.502 --> 12:29.742
Is my brother here?

12:30.862 --> 12:33.382
No, and if he does come
back and find you here,

12:33.542 --> 12:35.102
he'll kill you to collect that bounty.

12:35.262 --> 12:36.782
Well, you'd finally get your gift.

12:37.062 --> 12:38.302
In more ways than one.

12:52.893 --> 12:54.493
No prize money today.

13:01.493 --> 13:04.213
British intelligence is not
usually this wrong, are they?

13:04.653 --> 13:05.893
Not in my experience.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.253
Unless they mean to be.

13:07.573 --> 13:09.093
They mean to be what?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.053
Lennon ran Narcotics, didn't he?

13:11.373 --> 13:12.373
Yes.

13:14.813 --> 13:17.973
Well... old bosses got a
lot of juice with the troops.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.293
I mean, most of their guys are still there.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.253
What do you mean, Carl?

13:22.493 --> 13:24.613
What if he told them
exactly what to tell us?

13:25.053 --> 13:26.293
You mean to lie to us?

13:26.533 --> 13:27.693
Why would he do that?

13:27.893 --> 13:29.213
To get Tommy alone.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.653
What the hell is this now?

13:49.813 --> 13:51.853
- Armed police, stand still!
- What are you doing?

13:52.093 --> 13:53.389
Keep your hands where we can see them!

13:53.413 --> 13:55.213
I'm a detective. Kiss my bollocks.

13:58.733 --> 14:01.173
- Disarm yourself.
- What the hell is this, Lennon?

14:02.373 --> 14:05.133
Non-compliance would be an
unfortunate error in judgement.

14:09.373 --> 14:11.373
If I disarm you, it will not be pleasant.

14:19.493 --> 14:22.453
This is a birthday present,
so it better not get scratched.

14:26.613 --> 14:29.733
Thomas McConnell, you are being held
for obstructing a police inquiry.

14:29.893 --> 14:30.693
How's that now?

14:30.893 --> 14:33.893
We filmed you going to warn your
family about my investigation.

14:34.093 --> 14:36.333
Warn them? I only went there
to find out where Colin was

14:36.453 --> 14:37.933
so you could cross him off your list.

14:37.973 --> 14:40.653
Yeah, well, like I said, obstructing.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.020
This is load of shite.

14:51.940 --> 14:53.140
I asked for your help

14:53.340 --> 14:56.180
with an incident involving
the death of 18 citizens.

14:56.580 --> 14:59.820
You refused, and then you went to
warn your brother he was a suspect.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.036
- That's not what I did.
- Why did you go to the camp?

15:02.060 --> 15:03.060
To be sure.

15:03.220 --> 15:04.820
So you do think it's a possibility?

15:04.980 --> 15:06.140
Go to hell, man.

15:08.860 --> 15:11.140
I will let you sit here and
think about what you've done.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.380
You're going to ice me?

15:14.620 --> 15:16.300
I can sit here till Christmas.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.380
Lennon's clerk says
Tommy hasn't arrived yet,

15:25.940 --> 15:28.140
but I'm sure his phone has
been there more than an hour.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.100
They're lying, again.

15:30.940 --> 15:32.500
Come on, let's go. You drive.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.260
So... how are we in here, then?

15:41.140 --> 15:42.620
I'm thinking maybe a thousand pounds

15:42.820 --> 15:44.940
for every minute you've
kept me in here unjustly.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.540
That's close to 120,000 so far.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.500
And from whom would you receive this money?

15:49.620 --> 15:51.060
Great Scotland Yard.

15:51.460 --> 15:53.260
Right. Good luck with that.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.820
So you went to the camp

15:55.140 --> 15:57.580
to be sure your brother wasn't involved?

15:57.860 --> 15:59.180
To confirm I was right.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.740
Well, why don't you just ask him?

16:00.900 --> 16:01.900
What?

16:06.380 --> 16:08.180
Your brother's got a
question for you, Tinker.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.020
You tell him to piss off.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.500
Play nice.

16:16.900 --> 16:17.900
So...

16:19.540 --> 16:21.020
how's your day going, traitor?

16:25.300 --> 16:26.300
Dorn?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.820
I'm just getting your
authorization now, Louis.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.700
Thank you, but, uh,
that's not why I'm calling.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.100
No?

16:33.220 --> 16:35.740
I believe you know this
Chief Inspector Lennon well?

16:36.380 --> 16:37.820
I do know him, yes.

16:38.460 --> 16:39.940
Professionally and personally.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.780
Do you trust him?

16:44.460 --> 16:45.460
Yes.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.260
Why? What's happened?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.300
I need you to meet us in London.

16:51.100 --> 16:54.300
Well, I guess these copper shites are
no more your friends than mine, eh?

16:54.580 --> 16:56.140
Never said they were me friends.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.060
How long have you been here?

16:59.180 --> 17:01.461
Not enough to be intimidated
if that's what you're asking.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.036
I'm asking if you were already here

17:03.060 --> 17:04.579
when that wanker Lennon brought me in.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.660
Since this morning, about 8:00 or so.

17:07.220 --> 17:08.220
Christ...

17:10.060 --> 17:11.660
- Does Rose know?
- No.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.420
I was picked up in the pub.

17:13.579 --> 17:14.940
At 8:00 or so in the morning?

17:15.300 --> 17:17.796
- You're some lump, you know that?
- Yeah, I give a damn what you think.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.556
- Aye, you never did, did you?
- Let's get down to it.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.540
- Down to what?
- You remember "The Cant"?

17:22.099 --> 17:23.099
"Cant"?

17:23.140 --> 17:25.339
It's a secret language
used by the Travellers.

17:25.660 --> 17:26.660
How secret?

17:26.980 --> 17:29.020
Almost no one outside their world knows it.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.060
Almost.

17:32.060 --> 17:34.380
Come on, lad, tell me what I need to know.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.980
Will you shut the hell up!

17:46.780 --> 17:48.860
You think this shite can't
find someone to translate?

17:49.100 --> 17:51.900
- This is Scotland bloody Yard!
- And who would translate?

17:57.060 --> 17:58.500
And you always will be.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.740
Oh, he asked his brother what we know.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.860
That's a pretty damning question. But
it's not enough to catch him in it.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.300
So what do we do now?

18:08.460 --> 18:09.460
Now?

18:10.300 --> 18:11.620
Now we're onto round three.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.220
We're arriving in ten minutes.

18:26.780 --> 18:29.260
We've been going through all
the files Lennon provided, and...

18:29.700 --> 18:31.740
none of the victims appear to be Irish.

18:32.060 --> 18:35.460
He said they needed Tommy because
there were reluctant Irish victims.

18:35.820 --> 18:37.460
Well, we already know Lennon lied.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.700
But 900,000 ethnic Irish
people live in London,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.740
that's 12% of the city's population.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.140
How can a drug be entered
into a population like that,

18:45.300 --> 18:47.660
and completely miss a specific 12%?

18:47.820 --> 18:50.780
By being very selective who you
provide the poisoned drugs to.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.700
We've also gone through
the witness statements.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.820
A couple of them reference Irish dealers.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.420
And remember, Thierry told us
that most of the spiked drugs

18:58.500 --> 18:59.740
came from North London.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.380
Now, there's a very large
Traveller population in that area.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.260
Tommy's family may be involved.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.180
Maybe these guys should go to the camps

19:07.220 --> 19:08.740
and you and I head to Scotland Yard.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.180
That's a good idea.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.380
But be careful.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.100
Those camps could be tricky for outsiders.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.820
To hear Tommy tell it, that's
a bit of an understatement.

19:23.420 --> 19:24.620
That's all right, George.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.180
Creightons, O'Quinns,

19:29.820 --> 19:31.500
you ever arrest anyone who isn't Irish?

19:31.700 --> 19:33.100
I don't seem to have much cause.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.156
Think putting me in with these
boys is going to scare me?

19:35.180 --> 19:37.036
I've been fighting these
shites since I was a lad.

19:37.060 --> 19:38.740
You all right, Paddy? Did you miss me?

19:40.300 --> 19:42.380
I've got something more
interesting planned for you.

19:46.438 --> 19:47.438
Cuffs.

19:50.958 --> 19:51.998
Major Daniel.

19:52.558 --> 19:53.638
Where is Lennon?

19:54.118 --> 19:55.678
The Chief Inspector, he's not in.

19:55.998 --> 19:57.998
I believe the question was "Where is he?"

19:58.198 --> 19:59.198
And you are?

19:59.318 --> 20:00.398
Louis, I'm here.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.478
I'm Dorn. Chief Prosecutor of
the International Criminal Court.

20:07.238 --> 20:09.678
And as someone who knows
the Inspector personally,

20:10.318 --> 20:13.318
I suggest that you pick up whichever
device it is that connects you

20:13.438 --> 20:14.638
most quickly to him,

20:14.838 --> 20:16.918
so that we can stop him
before he does something

20:16.998 --> 20:18.358
that will end his career,

20:18.758 --> 20:20.318
and I suspect, yours with it.

20:21.318 --> 20:22.878
Probably a good idea to listen.

20:35.598 --> 20:36.598
The ICC?

20:36.758 --> 20:38.318
Yeah, tell them I'll be up shortly.

20:40.438 --> 20:42.198
Love to be a fly on that wall.

20:45.318 --> 20:46.518
So would I.

20:56.318 --> 20:57.878
I believe you two know each other.

20:58.078 --> 21:00.918
Did you have a reason to arrest him,
or are you just harassing him, too?

21:01.078 --> 21:02.718
That's not the question I'd be asking.

21:03.318 --> 21:05.118
I'd be asking if I could take the man.

21:11.598 --> 21:12.758
Defend yourself.

21:17.958 --> 21:18.958
Fair play.

21:20.158 --> 21:21.278
Defend yourself.

21:33.838 --> 21:35.478
I'm not going to fight you, Da.

21:39.358 --> 21:41.878
I realize this may seem an
odd way to conduct myself.

21:41.998 --> 21:44.238
- That is an understatement.
- It's chicken shit.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.478
You send us in the wrong direction, huh?

21:46.798 --> 21:48.398
To get Tommy alone for a few hours?

21:48.918 --> 21:49.758
Yes!

21:49.878 --> 21:51.598
Sir, the rest of the
team are near the camp.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.038
They want to check out the area.

21:53.238 --> 21:54.718
By all means, help them check it out.

21:55.438 --> 21:57.398
You don't understand
these people the way I do.

21:58.118 --> 21:59.958
In fact, I hesitate to
call them people at all.

21:59.998 --> 22:00.798
Excuse me?

22:00.998 --> 22:02.958
Pikeys, Pavee, Tinkers, Travellers,

22:03.318 --> 22:04.918
whatever you want to call these animals!

22:05.478 --> 22:06.478
Stop!

22:08.118 --> 22:10.078
Right now, Miles, stop.

22:11.358 --> 22:13.118
Would you give us a moment, please?

22:13.318 --> 22:14.878
I'd feel better if we had Tommy.

22:15.158 --> 22:16.438
We have tracked his phone.

22:16.558 --> 22:19.238
He's been here in this building
for the last three hours.

22:19.478 --> 22:22.118
He's having a reunion of sorts.

22:24.518 --> 22:25.958
You shamed my name.

22:26.558 --> 22:28.078
I raised you to be better than that.

22:28.238 --> 22:30.598
You raised me to be exactly as I am!

22:30.758 --> 22:31.758
Never.

22:31.838 --> 22:33.758
I spent 18 hours a day with you.

22:34.198 --> 22:36.878
Everything I think, everything
I know, it came from you!

22:36.998 --> 22:38.438
This is your mother's influence.

22:38.798 --> 22:41.638
She wishes the world was as she'd
like it to be, rather than how it is.

22:41.878 --> 22:44.238
It's called optimism, and
there's nothing wrong with it.

22:44.398 --> 22:45.558
Jesus, you're just like her.

22:45.718 --> 22:46.798
It's you I'm like!

22:47.078 --> 22:49.278
If you want to blame
someone, you blame yourself.

22:50.278 --> 22:51.638
Aye, come on then.

22:51.998 --> 22:53.198
Come on again!

22:55.238 --> 22:58.998
I have known you for more than 20
years, and I can truthfully say,

22:59.238 --> 23:01.958
I do not recognize the
man standing before me.

23:02.118 --> 23:03.118
Let me explain.

23:03.278 --> 23:06.798
No. No explanation that
begins with the sentence,

23:06.958 --> 23:10.678
"I hesitate to call them
people" bears listening to.

23:11.638 --> 23:12.718
"Animals"?

23:13.638 --> 23:17.478
I have spent my entire life
battling that attitude, that ethos.

23:19.101 --> 23:21.501
It is a very short journey, Miles,

23:21.941 --> 23:24.581
from that manner of
thinking to the gas chambers,

23:25.341 --> 23:26.901
to the mass beheadings.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.181
What do you call someone
who poisons, murders

23:29.341 --> 23:30.781
18 people they don't even know?

23:31.061 --> 23:33.581
Soldiers? Enemy combatants? Madmen?

23:34.381 --> 23:36.781
I call them what they are, people.

23:37.261 --> 23:40.021
Are you saying that you believe
this to be a deliberate act?

23:40.221 --> 23:42.941
I'm saying I believe this
to be an act of terrorism.

23:44.021 --> 23:45.021
Why?

23:45.501 --> 23:46.661
Why this?

23:47.581 --> 23:48.941
A bloody copper?

23:50.781 --> 23:51.781
Sean.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.101
Don't you let my son's
name cross your lips.

23:54.301 --> 23:56.421
He wasn't just your son. He was my brother.

23:58.821 --> 23:59.821
When he died...

23:59.901 --> 24:01.861
He was killed by these shites here!

24:02.381 --> 24:04.741
These British copper assholes!

24:05.341 --> 24:07.101
- Your friends!
- I was there!

24:08.901 --> 24:09.941
Do you remember?

24:10.581 --> 24:12.901
I watched it! I held him!

24:14.781 --> 24:15.781
Where were you?

24:17.221 --> 24:18.421
In jail.

24:19.101 --> 24:20.101
Again.

24:24.461 --> 24:25.901
We've never even talked about it.

24:26.101 --> 24:27.221
We don't need to.

24:27.341 --> 24:30.141
Aye, but you and I both know the truth.

24:31.301 --> 24:34.341
You sent him to rob that cop's
house because you didn't like him,

24:34.461 --> 24:35.861
because you had a grudge.

24:36.621 --> 24:38.141
A cop's house, Da.

24:39.461 --> 24:41.021
What did you think was going to happen?

24:42.421 --> 24:45.381
It gets 50 guys coming into our camp,

24:45.901 --> 24:48.061
all dying to have a pop at a Traveller.

24:49.261 --> 24:52.181
They're tossing caravans, and Sean...

24:53.741 --> 24:55.101
Sean's flying,

24:55.981 --> 24:57.661
high on adrenaline, pride's up,

24:57.821 --> 25:00.981
thinking he's invincible
like Big Mick McConnell.

25:02.901 --> 25:06.141
And he goes into your room and gets
a gun, and he takes a shot at them.

25:07.581 --> 25:10.381
50 guys, and he's going to
take them on with a pistol?

25:10.861 --> 25:14.501
So I beg him, I beg him, I
begged him to put it down,

25:16.101 --> 25:17.901
to come out with me, to surrender.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.861
He should have stayed inside.

25:22.181 --> 25:24.861
We walked out and he moved too fast.

25:25.701 --> 25:27.781
He was only going to
run, but he scared them,

25:29.301 --> 25:30.821
and a cop took a shot,

25:31.181 --> 25:32.261
and killed him.

25:32.461 --> 25:34.101
It ended the way it was always gonna end.

25:34.221 --> 25:35.821
It had to end that way.

25:37.061 --> 25:38.741
Does that make you feel better?

25:41.341 --> 25:43.501
I did what you would have done,

25:44.021 --> 25:45.421
what you would have told me to do,

25:45.581 --> 25:49.061
and I followed that cop, and I
found him, and I found his wife

25:49.341 --> 25:52.701
and his kids in a shitty little
house with their shitty little garden.

25:53.301 --> 25:55.301
Just like a place we'd
live but without the wheels.

25:55.381 --> 25:57.277
Why didn't you kill him
if you knew where he lived?

25:57.301 --> 25:59.541
Because I'm not gonna shoot
him in front of his children!

26:00.701 --> 26:02.821
Three months later, he
killed himself in his car.

26:03.501 --> 26:05.741
- Good.
- Jesus, Da, no one won.

26:07.341 --> 26:09.661
It destroyed his life,
but it destroyed us, too.

26:10.541 --> 26:12.421
And there has to be a
different way to live.

26:13.981 --> 26:15.861
That's the other thing I learned from you.

26:17.061 --> 26:18.061
You always said,

26:18.221 --> 26:21.221
"If no one else is going to do a
thing needs done, then you do it."

26:21.661 --> 26:23.061
So that's what I did.

26:24.741 --> 26:27.581
And I thought one of us
going into their world

26:28.661 --> 26:30.101
might just make a difference.

26:30.901 --> 26:32.981
So that day cost me two sons.

26:34.221 --> 26:35.221
Aye.

26:35.701 --> 26:37.341
But it might save your grandchildren.

26:37.821 --> 26:40.317
The drugs came from that camp, the
same camp the McConnells live in.

26:40.341 --> 26:43.141
They were poisoned on purpose to
kill young English men and women.

26:43.421 --> 26:45.461
- You know that for certain?
- Conclusively.

26:46.461 --> 26:47.741
And nothing happens in that camp

26:47.781 --> 26:49.581
that doesn't fall under
the eye of its leader,

26:50.061 --> 26:51.901
Michael Patrick McConnell.

26:57.461 --> 26:58.981
Chief Inspector wants you upstairs.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.061
Tommy...

27:13.381 --> 27:14.581
I don't hate you.

27:15.501 --> 27:16.541
See you, Da.

27:18.661 --> 27:21.461
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing. Just had a work-out.

27:23.901 --> 27:25.261
- You okay?
- Aye.

27:25.461 --> 27:27.621
This is just what happens
when my family gets together.

27:29.021 --> 27:30.021
All right.

27:30.741 --> 27:31.901
Open this.

27:34.501 --> 27:37.221
CCTV footage, witness
statements, street informants.

27:37.501 --> 27:39.781
Then why did you ask
Detective McConnell to come?

27:39.981 --> 27:41.917
Because I need him to get
an admission out of them.

27:41.941 --> 27:43.501
What, your informants can't testify?

27:43.701 --> 27:46.037
No, if they came forward publicly,
their lives would be over.

27:46.061 --> 27:47.941
As far as being a Traveller,
Tommy's already is.

27:48.021 --> 27:49.061
Tommy's what now?

27:49.261 --> 27:50.581
What's he saying about me?

27:51.421 --> 27:53.061
I'm going to need a conference room

27:53.221 --> 27:55.181
and all the available evidence you have.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.061
- Evidence?
- Yes, evidence.

27:57.341 --> 27:59.701
I'm going to handle this
the way you should have,

28:00.301 --> 28:02.181
by trusting Detective McConnell.

28:04.381 --> 28:05.901
You're sure the drugs came from there?

28:06.341 --> 28:08.261
We thought they came
through Calais first, but...

28:08.581 --> 28:10.261
Yeah, that's the spot.

28:10.661 --> 28:12.541
- How many ways in and out?
- Just the one.

28:13.421 --> 28:14.901
That road goes right through.

28:15.341 --> 28:16.861
Now, Tinkers know their security.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.301
- Tinkers?
- Travellers.

28:19.981 --> 28:21.141
That lot down there.

28:22.221 --> 28:23.221
Shite.

28:23.581 --> 28:25.021
Well, not all of them are shite.

28:25.581 --> 28:26.621
Whatever you say.

28:26.741 --> 28:28.301
- Guards?
- Probably.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.461
I'm going to check in with the
bosses, let them know we're here.

28:31.621 --> 28:32.901
We'll keep an eye on them.

28:33.061 --> 28:34.181
Good luck with that,

28:34.741 --> 28:36.821
they disappear in and out
of that camp like Houdini.

28:41.381 --> 28:42.501
I can't believe it.

28:43.101 --> 28:44.381
That they might be involved?

28:44.541 --> 28:45.861
That Tommy lived here.

28:45.981 --> 28:48.101
- He did?
- Most of his life.

28:50.581 --> 28:51.581
They are?

28:52.501 --> 28:54.461
No, no, all good here.

28:56.101 --> 28:57.301
No, leave them.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.541
Fall back and set up a loose perimeter.

29:00.141 --> 29:03.061
We don't want things going too far
before our other friends get there.

29:04.141 --> 29:05.221
Terrorism?

29:05.461 --> 29:08.061
Yeah, they have reason to believe
that the drugs were deliberately

29:08.181 --> 29:10.941
poisoned so they could kill as
many English people as possible.

29:11.261 --> 29:13.821
That's ridiculous. It's
just cut with something bad.

29:13.981 --> 29:15.501
We found something, too, Tommy.

29:16.581 --> 29:18.341
None of the victims were ethnic Irish.

29:18.661 --> 29:19.661
What?

29:19.741 --> 29:23.141
Someone was very selective about
who received tainted packages.

29:23.341 --> 29:26.461
We have CCTV footage tracing
the original drug shipment

29:26.701 --> 29:28.982
to a Traveller's camp, one
that you're very familiar with.

29:30.301 --> 29:31.101
No.

29:31.301 --> 29:33.501
- Apparently, it's your family's.
- We don't own it.

29:33.701 --> 29:35.077
Yeah, but your family does run it, no?

29:35.101 --> 29:36.141
They run the clan?

29:37.141 --> 29:38.821
- Tommy...
- Detective McConnell.

29:39.221 --> 29:40.301
Detective.

29:41.141 --> 29:44.181
I know, like these men here do, that
you are not like the rest of them.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.581
You said the opposite last time I was here.

29:46.741 --> 29:47.741
It's all right, Hickman.

29:47.941 --> 29:49.861
I needed to remind you
what the others were like,

29:49.901 --> 29:51.637
- the ones you ran away from...
- I never ran away.

29:51.661 --> 29:53.501
I needed to remind you
because I believe that

29:53.661 --> 29:56.301
they're planning on killing a
lot more people this time, and...

29:57.021 --> 29:59.581
Well, I was afraid that you
wouldn't believe me any other way.

30:01.861 --> 30:04.501
- I want to go to the camp.
- Good. We should all go.

30:04.821 --> 30:07.821
No. I need to see some people who
won't talk to me if you're with me.

30:08.141 --> 30:11.141
I will not let you go
there alone again, Tommy.

30:11.341 --> 30:12.541
We'll go with you,

30:13.701 --> 30:15.981
but stay out of it when
you need us to. All right?

30:17.981 --> 30:18.981
Fine.

30:23.901 --> 30:24.901
Tommy...

30:27.941 --> 30:29.061
Can I talk to you?

30:30.061 --> 30:32.101
- I'll wait in the car.
- No. Stay.

30:36.381 --> 30:37.541
What do you want?

30:40.541 --> 30:41.781
They arrested Colin.

30:42.181 --> 30:43.181
I know.

30:43.941 --> 30:46.101
- You have to help him.
- No, I don't.

30:46.301 --> 30:48.741
It doesn't matter to you
what'll happen to him?

30:48.941 --> 30:51.381
Last time I talked to you, you
told me he was going to kill me

30:51.501 --> 30:52.661
to collect a bounty.

30:53.501 --> 30:54.661
Do you want me to beg?

30:55.061 --> 30:56.741
I don't want you to do anything, Rose.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.621
Please, Tommy.

31:01.141 --> 31:02.301
I'll do anything.

31:02.741 --> 31:05.101
I have children. I can't raise them alone.

31:05.821 --> 31:07.941
I mean it, Tommy.

31:09.421 --> 31:10.861
- Anything.
- Stop it.

31:12.301 --> 31:13.421
- It's beneath you.
- Is it?

31:13.581 --> 31:15.901
It used to be. When you were...

31:16.061 --> 31:17.541
What, when I was yours?

31:17.901 --> 31:20.501
If it isn't beneath you, it's beneath me.

31:22.581 --> 31:23.781
Go home, Rosie.

31:24.901 --> 31:27.461
I'm done trying to help them. All of them.

31:28.741 --> 31:29.821
All of you.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.141
Let's go.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.781
I would've thought he'd be back by now.

31:44.181 --> 31:45.181
I agree.

31:45.221 --> 31:47.061
I'll go back down and
see what's keeping him.

31:47.621 --> 31:48.901
That's far enough.

31:52.445 --> 31:53.965
You're making a mistake here.

31:54.085 --> 31:55.085
Sit.

31:58.744 --> 32:00.704
We are from the
International Criminal Court.

32:02.063 --> 32:03.503
We're going to be looked for.

32:03.783 --> 32:04.783
Sit.

32:04.823 --> 32:06.103
You haven't hurt anyone yet.

32:06.303 --> 32:07.303
Really?

32:08.663 --> 32:10.423
Then what the hell are you doing here?

32:10.903 --> 32:12.223
You know we've hurt people.

32:12.623 --> 32:13.743
Just think about this.

32:14.703 --> 32:15.743
Sit down.

32:21.543 --> 32:22.663
All right, all right.

32:28.984 --> 32:31.184
You lot showing up has ruined everything.

32:42.543 --> 32:43.983
What do you know of the IRA?

32:45.663 --> 32:46.823
A good deal.

32:47.943 --> 32:49.663
You think this was the IRA?

32:49.823 --> 32:51.343
No. No, not at all.

32:51.783 --> 32:53.623
But my part of it starts there.

32:54.503 --> 32:56.263
We can still get the
stuff out on the street.

32:56.383 --> 32:57.703
Let's just get out of here, mate!

32:57.863 --> 32:59.783
No! We finish what we started.

33:00.583 --> 33:03.223
- You brought hostages into our camp?
- Not now!

33:03.343 --> 33:04.983
This is not what was agreed to.

33:05.384 --> 33:08.504
And the drugs you brought in
were outside the agreement, too.

33:08.743 --> 33:11.143
You were only to use our
network to move around.

33:11.263 --> 33:12.823
We never made the agreement with you.

33:13.183 --> 33:16.263
You think my husband and
son don't tell me everything?

33:16.423 --> 33:18.223
And you think I actually give a shit?

33:20.503 --> 33:21.703
1987.

33:23.304 --> 33:26.344
Two bombs in a shopping area exploded
within a minute of each other.

33:27.103 --> 33:29.223
The first was outside a shoe shop,

33:29.423 --> 33:31.303
and the second outside a catalogue shop.

33:38.223 --> 33:40.823
The bombs were in cast-iron litter bins

33:41.143 --> 33:42.863
causing large amounts of shrapnel.

33:43.663 --> 33:47.423
The first driving frantic survivors
directly in the path of the second.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.263
I mean, what kind of person does that?

33:52.263 --> 33:54.463
It was the second blast that
killed my wife instantly.

33:55.823 --> 33:57.783
Our twin three-year-olds
died in hospital later.

33:57.943 --> 33:59.863
I wanted to hold them one last time, but...

34:01.303 --> 34:02.463
couldn't.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.943
We were unable to find
the bombers. They had...

34:08.143 --> 34:10.143
slipped away. Disappeared.

34:13.223 --> 34:15.382
It was only years later that
I found out that they used

34:15.703 --> 34:17.463
the Traveller's networks,
the infrastructure,

34:17.503 --> 34:19.943
to slip in and out of
London. These Pavee bastards,

34:20.503 --> 34:23.143
they actually helped the men
that carried out that attack.

34:27.382 --> 34:31.103
The IRA is just another
bloody political party now,

34:31.583 --> 34:33.703
and none of them can be arrested for it,

34:33.902 --> 34:36.503
even if it was them, but the Travellerss

34:38.183 --> 34:39.422
they're not off limits.

34:40.103 --> 34:41.503
They're still fair game.

34:47.143 --> 34:48.862
And it's time someone paid.

34:53.902 --> 34:57.623
We just celebrated Detective
McConnell's 30th birthday.

34:58.943 --> 35:01.383
He was three in 1987.

35:01.703 --> 35:03.263
Same age as your twins.

35:04.423 --> 35:06.663
Yeah, well, at least he got to be 30.

35:11.503 --> 35:13.423
The next shipment of
poisoned drugs is down there

35:13.463 --> 35:15.183
in that camp ready to be put on the street.

35:15.823 --> 35:18.943
That is a very exigent circumstance.
I say a massive raid is called for.

35:19.383 --> 35:21.703
Massive raid? There's
innocent people down there.

35:21.823 --> 35:22.823
It's full of criminals.

35:22.983 --> 35:24.903
No, there's women, and
children, and old people.

35:25.543 --> 35:27.159
Let me go in first and see what I can do.

35:27.183 --> 35:27.943
No.

35:28.063 --> 35:30.223
I thought you wanted me here
so I could talk to people?

35:31.263 --> 35:32.503
All units, stand by.

35:33.063 --> 35:33.903
Tommy, wait!

35:33.983 --> 35:34.983
What?

35:35.623 --> 35:37.039
You don't have to get
in the middle of this.

35:37.063 --> 35:39.399
If I don't, none of what I've
done has been worth it, none of it.

35:39.423 --> 35:40.743
- Then I'm coming with you.
- No!

35:40.863 --> 35:41.983
It has to be me.

35:43.303 --> 35:46.423
You said you only wanted to use
our networks to hide from the law.

35:46.743 --> 35:48.423
You never said you wanted to hurt people!

35:48.543 --> 35:50.583
You got paid! That's all that matters.

35:50.703 --> 35:52.983
The Pavee don't involve ourselves in drugs.

35:53.143 --> 35:53.943
You do now.

35:54.063 --> 35:55.663
Why are you doing this, Aiden?

35:55.783 --> 35:56.863
For Belfast.

35:57.023 --> 35:58.343
- For Dublin!
- What?

35:58.503 --> 36:00.583
- You never even lived there!
- Back off!

36:01.943 --> 36:05.223
As long as there are Irishmen under
British rule, the struggle continues.

36:05.903 --> 36:07.503
My father died for that.

36:07.983 --> 36:10.103
And after we get this next
batch of gear out there,

36:10.543 --> 36:12.183
the Brits will know we're at war again.

36:12.623 --> 36:14.463
You want to start the war again?

36:15.143 --> 36:16.423
You're insane.

36:16.543 --> 36:18.303
They'll call me hero one day.

36:18.503 --> 36:19.503
Aiden

36:20.223 --> 36:22.223
you don't know what it was like then.

36:23.263 --> 36:24.623
All the deaths,

36:25.063 --> 36:26.223
the tears.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.263
No one will ever call you a hero for this.

36:32.143 --> 36:33.343
The police are coming.

36:33.863 --> 36:36.703
A lot of them. You should go now
and leave everyone here alone.

36:36.903 --> 36:37.703
Go?

36:37.863 --> 36:40.583
I can show you how, but
you have to let this all go.

36:41.063 --> 36:41.903
No!

36:42.023 --> 36:44.383
The children, they'll all be in the middle!

36:45.823 --> 36:49.023
There's a tunnel, under
that caravan, a false floor.

36:49.823 --> 36:52.023
Anne, show them. Hurry!

36:53.783 --> 36:55.063
It's your only chance.

36:57.223 --> 36:58.543
Go, go, go, go, go!

37:05.703 --> 37:07.183
No shooting! No shooting!

37:07.423 --> 37:10.023
These are just women and children!
They've gone! They've left!

37:10.263 --> 37:11.983
Tell them, your friends are okay!

37:12.103 --> 37:13.103
Lower your weapons!

37:13.143 --> 37:14.679
There's no one here
that's a threat anymore!

37:14.703 --> 37:16.583
Lower your weapons! Stand down.

37:16.743 --> 37:18.343
The people you're looking for are gone!

37:20.743 --> 37:23.983
I'm a detective from the
International Criminal Court

37:24.423 --> 37:26.023
and I'm asking you to stand down.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.103
I'm going to disarm myself.

37:31.503 --> 37:34.503
If you do anything here, you'll
be shooting one of your own first!

37:36.063 --> 37:37.263
I'm begging you...

37:39.023 --> 37:41.063
lower your weapons and stand down!

37:59.063 --> 38:00.183
You said they've gone?

38:00.303 --> 38:02.519
The drug dealers, the ones
responsible for the poisoning?

38:02.543 --> 38:03.863
Yes, all of them.

38:06.423 --> 38:09.863
Your terrorists are in a
house not far from here.

38:10.943 --> 38:12.223
It's one of our safe houses.

38:12.983 --> 38:14.583
You get a team to this address.

38:21.023 --> 38:22.183
How are they doing it?

38:22.303 --> 38:25.103
I'm about to show you something no
one outside the Pavee has ever seen.

38:44.983 --> 38:46.543
We got all the criminals,

38:47.743 --> 38:48.903
and the drugs.

38:49.223 --> 38:50.223
Good.

38:51.183 --> 38:53.223
What you did took courage, Tommy.

38:53.863 --> 38:55.023
I get that a lot.

38:56.503 --> 38:57.703
We'll be waiting.

39:01.663 --> 39:03.183
You were a hero out there, Ma.

39:04.263 --> 39:05.663
Not as much as you were.

39:06.823 --> 39:08.863
I told Scotland Yard where the tunnels are.

39:10.463 --> 39:11.463
Yeah.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.423
People are going to hate you for that.

39:17.343 --> 39:18.983
Even more than they already do?

39:20.743 --> 39:23.983
But at least you can explain
it to Da and to Colin.

39:29.823 --> 39:30.823
Ma?

39:32.703 --> 39:34.463
I need you to do something else.

39:37.023 --> 39:40.903
I can give you proof that your father
and Colin were in Wales last weekend

39:42.143 --> 39:43.663
when all this happened,

39:44.783 --> 39:46.503
the drug distribution thing.

39:47.383 --> 39:48.863
You want me to inform on them?

39:49.303 --> 39:52.983
They're being held as
accessories to 18 deaths.

39:53.463 --> 39:54.463
Murders.

39:55.743 --> 39:57.743
They'll lock them away for
the rest of their lives.

40:00.263 --> 40:03.223
I've never informed on the family. Never.

40:03.543 --> 40:05.183
It's not just the deaths.

40:06.583 --> 40:09.823
They're accused of dealing
drugs that kill people.

40:10.823 --> 40:13.103
Our family would never deal drugs.

40:14.623 --> 40:16.183
It's a line we won't cross.

40:17.343 --> 40:19.383
It's important for the family now,

40:21.503 --> 40:23.503
especially for the future generations.

40:26.703 --> 40:28.183
I'll never be able to come back.

40:31.263 --> 40:34.143
We've already learned to
live without you, Tommy.

40:36.183 --> 40:39.823
Don't let them take your father
and Colin from us forever, too.

40:53.183 --> 40:54.183
Thank you.

40:57.223 --> 40:59.383
I knew they had tunnels. I knew it.

40:59.663 --> 41:01.143
But you would never have found them

41:01.303 --> 41:03.303
if it had not been for Detective McConnell.

41:03.623 --> 41:05.303
He only helped because he had no choice.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.583
No, that's not true.

41:06.743 --> 41:09.663
He didn't need to show you
the geography of the tunnels.

41:10.263 --> 41:11.703
He chose to do that,

41:12.183 --> 41:15.023
as an act of peace, despite
everything you have done.

41:15.983 --> 41:18.063
I was doing my job.

41:18.623 --> 41:20.143
And do you feel better now?

41:21.383 --> 41:22.623
Has the pain gone?

41:23.943 --> 41:25.143
I'm sorry?

41:25.543 --> 41:28.303
No, it has not gone. It will never go.

41:28.663 --> 41:32.143
That will only happen with forgiveness.

41:32.343 --> 41:34.303
I can never forgive those bastards.

41:34.623 --> 41:35.703
Not them.

41:36.183 --> 41:38.023
You. Yourself.

41:38.903 --> 41:40.983
You must, you have to forgive yourself.

41:42.303 --> 41:43.823
That's how it all begins.

41:44.623 --> 41:45.663
Trust me.

41:48.703 --> 41:49.703
Yes?

41:50.103 --> 41:51.663
Lennon, I need to talk to you.

41:52.743 --> 41:53.743
About?

41:55.263 --> 41:58.063
My father and my brother were
involved in some criminal activity.

41:58.703 --> 41:59.703
In Wales.

42:15.943 --> 42:17.143
Goodnight, there, Tommy.

42:24.143 --> 42:25.143
Hey...

42:30.103 --> 42:31.503
I owe you an apology.

42:32.703 --> 42:33.783
An apology?

42:36.943 --> 42:37.943
Yeah.

42:38.103 --> 42:40.543
I had a pretty good idea
how much Lennon disliked you.

42:40.823 --> 42:41.983
He told mee

42:43.223 --> 42:45.263
in his office when we met him, and...

42:47.263 --> 42:48.583
I should have told you.

42:49.863 --> 42:51.383
You're right, you should have told me.

42:52.943 --> 42:54.663
Not sure I would have listened anyway.

42:54.863 --> 42:56.303
You wouldn't have listened.

42:59.663 --> 43:01.463
And it's me who owes you an apology.

43:03.303 --> 43:04.303
For what?

43:04.983 --> 43:06.143
For my family.

43:07.423 --> 43:10.103
I'm here swearing they'd never be
involved in something like this,

43:11.503 --> 43:14.143
and there they are, right
smack bang in the middle of it.

43:19.303 --> 43:21.863
Back when I was a young
cop, still in the blues,

43:23.623 --> 43:24.743
my brother

43:26.143 --> 43:28.823
was the biggest drug dealer
in the area that I worked.

43:30.103 --> 43:31.943
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

43:32.303 --> 43:34.463
Rule was never talk about
it in front of my mother.

43:34.663 --> 43:35.663
She didn't know?

43:35.703 --> 43:38.263
She definitely knew. We all
just pretended that she didn't.

43:39.943 --> 43:40.703
Wow.

43:40.903 --> 43:43.783
Point is, we all got family
hanging around our neck.

43:43.983 --> 43:45.583
Doesn't reflect on who you are.

43:46.863 --> 43:48.463
Not to the people who really know you.

43:53.463 --> 43:54.463
Where is he now?

43:56.303 --> 43:57.343
Who's that, my brother?

43:58.343 --> 44:00.303
20 years sober. Yeah.

44:01.063 --> 44:03.703
Runs the Narcotics
Anonymous program in Queens.

44:03.983 --> 44:05.599
So you're saying there's
hope for my family?

44:05.623 --> 44:08.943
No. No, after what I saw, they're
completely lost. What I'm saying is

44:09.583 --> 44:11.303
you can stop apologizing for them.

44:13.183 --> 44:14.463
They're not your burden.

44:17.623 --> 44:18.663
See you tomorrow?

44:19.023 --> 44:20.343
Sure no one else will have me.

44:20.503 --> 44:22.263
Around here, that's a pretty big club.
