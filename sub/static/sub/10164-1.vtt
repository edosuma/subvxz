02:02.569 --> 02:04.685
Morning, Miss Elizabeth.

02:17.769 --> 02:20.442
Captain Pritchard! Captain!

02:24.489 --> 02:25.717
Good morning.

02:25.969 --> 02:30.679
Sober up, you pair of drunken hunks!
And get aboard!

02:31.089 --> 02:34.479
-Beautiful morning.
-Stay away from my fiancé.

02:34.729 --> 02:37.801
He's wasting his life,
and I need a surgeon.

02:38.049 --> 02:41.439
Stop filling him with ideas
of making a fortune.

02:41.689 --> 02:46.046
Don't flap your sails.
Dr. Gulliver could be rich...

02:46.289 --> 02:49.042
...bringing back chemicals
to sell in London.

02:49.249 --> 02:51.126
Or be boiled by savages.

02:51.569 --> 02:56.882
There are no cannibals in the
East Indies. I'll take care of him.

02:57.089 --> 03:00.161
He's going to stay
and take care of me!

03:07.569 --> 03:09.719
-Morning, Dr. Gulliver.
-Morning.

03:09.969 --> 03:13.928
-Bit of a haggle going on outside.
-How are your insides?

03:14.129 --> 03:16.927
Thanks to you, my liver's healthy.

03:17.169 --> 03:20.878
That's why I've come to pay.
Here. Now then....

03:22.769 --> 03:26.284
I'm sorry it's not cash money,
doctor, but....

03:29.769 --> 03:33.682
-You promised to meet me.
-Close the door. My fee will escape!

03:36.969 --> 03:39.927
A long and happy marriage
to you both.

03:40.169 --> 03:43.081
Drive him toward the corner!

03:43.689 --> 03:46.886
Mr. Grinch is waiting
at the cottage.

03:51.729 --> 03:56.359
No wonder I love you.
You're always sweeping me off my feet.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.720
-Fine life, chasing chickens.
-I'll chase them.

03:59.969 --> 04:04.281
You take care of the sick.
I'll take care of the doctor.

04:05.369 --> 04:09.362
My fees. I should close my practice
and open a vegetable stall.

04:09.569 --> 04:11.685
Not today.

04:12.689 --> 04:17.843
We're going to see old Grinch
about that cottage. You promised!

04:18.048 --> 04:21.678
For a man of no promise,
I make a lot of promises.

04:23.569 --> 04:29.360
We'll get 2 shillings for this.
We'll have 10 pounds for Mr. Grinch.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.481
-Mr. Grinch.
-There.

04:42.169 --> 04:45.081
I'll pay you when
I return from the war.

04:45.329 --> 04:49.038
-The war with Spain is over.
-The war with France.

04:49.249 --> 04:52.685
Come back alive
and you don't owe me a thing.

05:08.689 --> 05:11.328
Please don't judge it
from the outside.

05:11.529 --> 05:15.727
We can get Travers the carpenter
to fix it and the shutters.

05:15.969 --> 05:21.919
-He owes you for the bunion treatment.
-Travers is in debtors' prison.

05:22.169 --> 05:26.685
How terrible.
Well, we'll manage somehow.

05:26.969 --> 05:29.688
As well as Travers anyway.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.484
I'd carry you across the threshold
if it were safe.

05:43.169 --> 05:46.286
-Good morning.
-It took you long enough.

05:46.489 --> 05:47.717
Where's the £10?

05:47.969 --> 05:50.483
You're such a sentimentalist.

05:50.729 --> 05:53.721
-I have it here.
-You'll fix that door.

05:53.969 --> 05:57.359
It was fine until you banged it.
The price is set.

05:57.569 --> 06:00.879
£10 down, I'll hold
the mortgage for the rest.

06:01.129 --> 06:06.283
You'll be surprised what a little soap
will do for this place.

06:06.569 --> 06:08.082
Here.

06:12.529 --> 06:15.089
-Are you all right?
-I think so.

06:15.289 --> 06:17.883
-You're short.
-The devil with you!

06:18.129 --> 06:19.847
She won't live here.

06:20.049 --> 06:22.722
-I'll take it.
-Not if it were free!

06:22.969 --> 06:27.326
I won't let you spend the rest
of your days in this existence.

06:27.529 --> 06:30.248
-Come on. Careful.
-It's only for now.

06:30.729 --> 06:35.928
If I stay, I'll be in the same
grinding rut tomorrow and always.

06:36.169 --> 06:39.718
-Without money, nothing changes.
-That's all you think of?

06:40.729 --> 06:44.517
-Be content with what we have.
-We have nothing!

06:44.769 --> 06:48.728
Why are we quarrelling?
Jealousy about another man or woman?

06:48.969 --> 06:51.688
No, it's money,
the watchword of Wapping.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.801
-It isn't important to me!
-It is to me!

06:55.169 --> 06:59.560
As a doctor, I want to help
the sick without worry and debts.

06:59.889 --> 07:04.167
-You don't have to be rich!
-You have to be rich to be anything.

07:04.369 --> 07:09.363
You just want to go with
Captain Pritchard. Then go. Go!

07:09.569 --> 07:14.484
But it's over between us!
It's over forever!

07:20.889 --> 07:22.481
Elizabeth!

07:43.689 --> 07:48.319
-If this keeps up, I'll starve.
-Don't usually hit storms this soon.

07:48.529 --> 07:53.478
Cheer up. An early storm
means a successful journey.

07:54.489 --> 07:56.286
Elizabeth!

07:56.489 --> 07:58.684
Found her hiding in the hold.

07:58.929 --> 08:00.726
-That be all.
-You okay?

08:00.969 --> 08:03.085
Fine, thank you. Hungry.

08:03.329 --> 08:05.684
You're insane to come like this.

08:05.889 --> 08:08.403
You'll be boiled by savages.

08:08.649 --> 08:13.325
Then we'll cook together.
I'd follow you to the earth's end.

08:13.569 --> 08:16.527
We're going, but not you.
How do we get her home?

08:16.729 --> 08:21.484
-Ships go from the Canary Islands.
-I'm not getting off!

08:21.689 --> 08:25.477
Now, Elizabeth!
It's wet out here!

08:31.689 --> 08:35.078
You're still getting off
at the Canary Islands.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.120
-I am not!
-You are!

08:37.369 --> 08:41.486
Nothing will change my plan!
Absolutely nothing!

09:18.769 --> 09:20.282
Gwendolyn?

09:20.929 --> 09:23.045
Don't cry.
I'll think of something.

09:23.249 --> 09:28.118
I'm not Lilliputian anymore.
We've been banished. We have to leave.

09:28.369 --> 09:31.486
You can't escape.
The emperor has spies everywhere.

09:31.689 --> 09:33.884
We have to try.

09:36.569 --> 09:39.686
But you shouldn't risk your life too.

09:42.489 --> 09:44.798
Except that I love you.

10:06.929 --> 10:11.286
We'll never be together.
We'll never marry.

10:11.929 --> 10:14.648
It's this war. This stupid war!

10:15.169 --> 10:18.081
lsn't there somewhere we can go?

10:20.369 --> 10:22.280
Just here.

10:22.569 --> 10:24.685
Here and now.

10:24.969 --> 10:27.688
Please stay, Gwendolyn.

10:28.569 --> 10:30.082
Gwendolyn!

10:31.929 --> 10:37.401
I've been waiting an hour at the cove.
This is no time for love.

10:37.649 --> 10:40.925
She has no time for a man
who serves that tyrant.

10:41.169 --> 10:44.684
My loyalties are not to him,
but to Lilliput!

10:47.689 --> 10:50.886
-Run!
-Help me.

10:58.169 --> 11:02.845
Reldresal, I've caught you with
that traitor. Guards, take them!

11:04.849 --> 11:09.684
I'll prove your guilt by
taking your head to the emperor!

11:28.529 --> 11:31.680
Go, before they come back!
Stay at the cave.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.083
What shall we do, Lord Flimnap?

11:42.169 --> 11:46.924
I'll go get the army, the navy
and our fearless emperor.

11:47.169 --> 11:51.287
Stay there. Watch the giant.
Have courage!

12:09.769 --> 12:13.125
I am minister of finance
and will be prime minister.

12:13.369 --> 12:15.883
I should go first.

12:18.169 --> 12:22.879
Archers, spear carriers,
stand ready.

12:23.369 --> 12:26.520
If he eats me,
the nation goes bankrupt.

12:26.769 --> 12:29.488
Proceed at your own risk.

12:32.569 --> 12:34.287
Yes.

12:34.569 --> 12:39.689
Since you are minister of the interior,
and he lies in our interior...

12:39.889 --> 12:41.880
...you proceed.

12:54.569 --> 12:57.800
-Hello.
-He's alive!

13:03.129 --> 13:06.565
Archers, spears, shoot! Shoot!

13:07.569 --> 13:08.888
Halt!

13:09.569 --> 13:14.882
-As war minister, I say shoot!
-I say halt and I mean halt!

13:15.569 --> 13:18.322
He'll pay when I'm prime minister.

13:18.529 --> 13:21.282
-If you do.
-Are you for or against me?

13:21.489 --> 13:24.720
My loyalties lie
with the strongest side.

13:25.169 --> 13:27.603
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:31.329 --> 13:34.924
I'm Dr. Lemuel Gulliver.
Where am I?

13:35.169 --> 13:38.684
-In the land of Lilliput.
-Lilliput?

13:41.329 --> 13:44.082
I won't hurt you.
Why am I tied down?

13:44.329 --> 13:47.287
We couldn't be sure,
you happened so suddenly.

13:47.529 --> 13:52.603
Our enemies sent him to kill us.
He's their secret weapon.

13:52.849 --> 13:55.488
Weapon? No, a wave washed me
off a ship--

13:55.729 --> 13:58.527
Elizabeth. I must find her.
Let me up.

13:58.969 --> 14:02.882
-He'll break free! Kill him!
-No, I won't harm anyone.

14:03.129 --> 14:06.007
I'm civilized.
A doctor, from England.

14:06.769 --> 14:11.081
-England? What is England?
-The place I come from.

14:11.729 --> 14:14.118
There's only one place.
Lilliput.

14:14.369 --> 14:17.327
-And Blefuscu.
-It's disloyal to mention that.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.885
I've never heard of it.

14:20.089 --> 14:22.683
Loyal enough for you, Flimnap?

15:21.689 --> 15:25.568
Greetings, emperor,
delight and terror of all universe.

15:25.769 --> 15:30.365
Monarch of monarchs. Pleasant as
spring, comfortable as summer.

15:30.569 --> 15:33.720
True. That's because I plan ahead.

15:33.969 --> 15:36.324
Fruitful as autumn,
dreadful as winter.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.278
Whose head presses the sky,
at whose nod princes shake.

15:40.529 --> 15:42.918
I cannot dispute it. I cannot.

15:43.169 --> 15:47.287
An emperor with a plan is
a powerful emperor.

15:49.129 --> 15:54.487
-Present him to me.
-Your Majesty, I wish to present--

15:54.729 --> 15:59.086
I present Dr. Gulliver,
from a place he calls England.

15:59.329 --> 16:05.120
Your Majesty.
I mean no harm to you or anyone.

16:05.369 --> 16:08.839
I want only to return home.
A boat is all I need.

16:09.049 --> 16:13.839
A boat? To join the enemy armada.
To sink our navy.

16:14.049 --> 16:15.721
He's our enemy.

16:15.969 --> 16:19.484
I am not an enemy.
I'm only different.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.606
That's the same thing.

16:21.849 --> 16:27.321
As different from your people as you
are different. We are both unique.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.402
Since you are unique, and I am unique--

16:30.609 --> 16:33.123
We're the same,
which makes you a giant.

16:33.329 --> 16:36.719
You see? As cunning as our enemies.

16:37.289 --> 16:40.486
He'll blight our lives.

16:53.009 --> 16:56.285
A dark omen in the skies.

16:56.569 --> 17:01.120
-You may be right about him, Flimnap.
-He's not.

17:01.369 --> 17:03.678
I'll prove my worth.

17:14.169 --> 17:16.922
Stop it! Stop!

17:32.569 --> 17:38.007
A maker of miracles! As I suspected.
Fits my plan. A miracle-maker!

17:38.249 --> 17:41.719
-So are you, sire.
-Oh, yes, so am I.

17:41.969 --> 17:45.644
Gulliver and I are the same.
We are.

17:45.889 --> 17:49.848
Since we are, and you are free
to move and eat what you like...

17:50.089 --> 17:54.321
...isn't it terrible to have me
tied down and starving?

17:54.569 --> 17:58.323
It isn't safe
to release this hurricane!

17:58.569 --> 18:02.482
Nonsense. We have archers
ready with poisoned arrows.

18:02.729 --> 18:04.082
Thousands.

18:04.289 --> 18:07.725
-I trust the giant's word.
-And so do I.

18:08.569 --> 18:13.484
I trust and have abiding faith
in the integrity and reliability...

18:13.689 --> 18:16.920
...of any man that I can kill.

18:17.169 --> 18:20.639
Release his bonds.
Prepare to feed him.

18:21.689 --> 18:23.680
Release the giant!

18:28.249 --> 18:32.800
-We must get on with my plan.
-Wait! What about my boat?

18:33.009 --> 18:36.081
We can discuss that later.

18:37.369 --> 18:41.044
-I wouldn't bother him now.
-I must find Elizabeth.

18:42.889 --> 18:47.087
I know how you feel.
I have someone I love too.

18:47.769 --> 18:49.680
I'll try to help you.

19:35.929 --> 19:38.238
Thank you. I'm very fond of beef.

19:38.449 --> 19:43.648
Look at him! He started working
on his boat and his appetite doubled.

19:43.969 --> 19:46.608
He inhales our food.

19:46.849 --> 19:51.365
30 sheep, 10 loaves of bread
at a meal. It's nothing to him.

19:51.569 --> 19:55.118
-I'll work for my food.
-You'll starve us!

19:55.369 --> 19:58.645
Our mathematicians
have determined that...

19:58.889 --> 20:04.168
...he is equal in size
to 1728 of our own people.

20:04.409 --> 20:10.325
And he eats as much as 1728.
I say poison him.

20:10.569 --> 20:14.403
No! Your Majesty,
he can do the work of 1728.

20:14.649 --> 20:19.882
The more he works, the more he eats!
We haven't enough land to grow food.

20:20.089 --> 20:24.924
I'll clear more land. There.
A forest where you should have crops.

20:25.169 --> 20:30.880
I told you he's mad! Whoever heard
of growing crops in a forest?

20:36.329 --> 20:40.083
Look! The giant man
has enormous strength!

21:14.169 --> 21:17.161
I'll leave a fringe
for a windbreak...

21:17.369 --> 21:21.078
...and some in the south quarter
for a watershed.

21:30.369 --> 21:32.007
Make way for the emperor!

21:32.689 --> 21:38.366
All hail the emperor!
All hail the emperor!

21:41.329 --> 21:45.117
I'll clear the rocks,
and you'll have more farmland.

21:45.529 --> 21:48.566
Amazing! Astounding!

21:49.329 --> 21:54.483
He's our invincible weapon.
We're the same, you know.

21:54.729 --> 21:57.926
As I clear the land,
I will till it.

21:58.129 --> 22:02.122
I'll turn the earth
and I'll dig the furrows.

22:02.369 --> 22:04.724
-Hail Gulliver!
-Hooray for the giant!

22:04.969 --> 22:07.324
The strongest man alive!

22:07.569 --> 22:13.087
Thank you. I'll do more for you.
Anything you can think of.

22:18.329 --> 22:21.924
He can stop floods,
end droughts...

22:22.169 --> 22:24.888
...grow enough for everybody!

22:25.089 --> 22:29.924
He can starve us to death.
He is a curse disguised as a blessing.

22:30.169 --> 22:33.923
He will eat us out of meat,
and you like ox.

22:34.169 --> 22:36.125
I do, that's true.

22:36.369 --> 22:41.079
-Your Majesty likes fish more.
-There are not enough fishermen.

22:41.329 --> 22:46.483
Fish? The ocean is there
to give us all we want.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.880
No one will ever go hungry.

23:39.129 --> 23:43.964
No man will steal or be jealous
of another. No more jails.

23:44.449 --> 23:47.521
A land without greed or envy.

23:47.729 --> 23:52.883
A land of love,
where no man has an enemy.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.881
-The giant doesn't hate anyone.
-Quiet!

23:59.089 --> 24:01.887
I know what I'm doing.

24:09.169 --> 24:11.888
I must finish my boat
and find Elizabeth.

24:12.089 --> 24:14.922
You mean, you'd leave us
for a woman?

24:15.169 --> 24:19.128
We will both return and
make Lilliput a heaven on earth.

24:19.329 --> 24:21.524
He can't. He's not a citizen.

24:21.769 --> 24:25.967
Precisely. Administer
the oath of loyalty, Flimnap.

24:26.209 --> 24:29.485
Make him a citizen of Lilliput!

24:30.369 --> 24:34.885
As prescribed by law, take
the right foot in the left hand.

24:35.129 --> 24:38.804
Then place your right middle finger
on your head.

24:39.009 --> 24:42.206
No, no. Not the left hand,
the right hand.

24:42.409 --> 24:44.877
Pay attention. That's better.

24:45.329 --> 24:48.844
Then put your right thumb
in your ear and repeat.

24:59.689 --> 25:02.044
Look out! He's falling!

25:03.609 --> 25:05.361
Look out below!

25:16.249 --> 25:18.922
You are now a citizen of Lilliput.

25:19.169 --> 25:22.047
You may finish your boat,
and we'll help.

25:22.249 --> 25:26.879
Then you may find your Elizabeth
and return to this land.

25:27.129 --> 25:28.403
The perfect land.

25:28.809 --> 25:31.243
-Better than any other?
-By far.

25:31.569 --> 25:35.562
And make ready to destroy
the hated Blefuscu.

25:35.809 --> 25:39.961
-That place I never heard of?
-It's across the channel.

25:40.169 --> 25:45.038
Crush and annihilate them!
Make tidal waves! Drown them!

25:45.289 --> 25:48.486
No, I'm a doctor,
dedicated to saving lives.

25:48.689 --> 25:52.967
Either you kill them,
or you'll never finish your boat.

25:53.529 --> 25:58.762
Or you'll never find Elizabeth,
or live in this perfect land.

25:59.129 --> 26:02.405
Tomorrow, we pick our prime minister.

26:02.609 --> 26:05.248
And when we pick him, we march.

26:05.449 --> 26:08.646
And you march with us
against the Blefuscu...

26:08.889 --> 26:12.438
...or we march against you.

26:22.409 --> 26:24.718
Dr. Gulliver.

26:26.129 --> 26:29.201
I'm sorry this happened.

26:29.409 --> 26:33.766
So am I. I only needed
a few more days to finish my boat.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.085
I can't murder innocents.

26:36.329 --> 26:40.686
-They're little people, like us.
-Then there's nothing to fear.

26:40.889 --> 26:45.644
Except they have a big fleet.
A fleet 20 times bigger than ours.

26:45.849 --> 26:50.081
I'm bigger than a fleet.
I don't need a boat to get there.

26:50.329 --> 26:53.401
They'll be so scared,
they wouldn't attack.

26:53.609 --> 26:55.964
No, they wouldn't.

26:56.169 --> 26:59.445
I'd show them I made this a paradise.

26:59.689 --> 27:02.487
They'll want the same,
so they'll need me.

27:02.729 --> 27:06.802
-And no more war.
-Then we can marry the women we love.

27:07.209 --> 27:11.168
Not if Flimnap wins
the contest tomorrow.

27:11.889 --> 27:15.165
-He will want bloodshed.
-He's that powerful?

27:15.449 --> 27:18.600
-If he wins, he is.
-Then you must win.

27:18.809 --> 27:24.167
-His spies will make me lose.
-Not as long as I'm around.

27:24.529 --> 27:27.168
Oh, yes. You and I, together.

27:27.489 --> 27:30.242
We can win the war for Gwendolyn...

27:30.529 --> 27:33.282
...if she hasn't left
with her father.

27:33.529 --> 27:35.485
I've got to stop them!

28:02.729 --> 28:07.439
Be off with you! It's your fault
we missed the boat to Blefuscu!

28:07.689 --> 28:11.887
But I made us a raft.
Farewell, vile land of misery.

28:12.129 --> 28:16.964
-I'll restore your title.
-I won't give an inch to the emperor!

28:17.209 --> 28:20.758
You don't have to.
I'm competing for prime minister.

28:20.969 --> 28:24.086
Gulliver and I will make
Lilliput a paradise.

28:24.329 --> 28:27.082
-Who's that?
-The giant man.

28:27.329 --> 28:29.479
I don't trust giants.

28:29.729 --> 28:34.928
Give Reldresal a chance.
If he fails, we'll both go with you.

28:35.129 --> 28:37.359
I won't fail. I need time.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.001
Please, Father?

28:40.249 --> 28:45.448
You have until noon tomorrow.
I'm going to the raft to mend the sail.

28:50.369 --> 28:54.840
Hear ye! Hear ye! Citizen Gulliver
is approaching the castle!

28:56.929 --> 29:02.959
Hear ye! Hear ye! Citizen Gulliver
is approaching the castle!

29:21.849 --> 29:24.204
The man-mountain approaches.

29:24.449 --> 29:26.838
Clear the ground!

29:28.409 --> 29:30.877
Clear the ground!

29:51.809 --> 29:56.360
-Forgive my abrupt entrance.
-Wait until the gate is open.

29:56.569 --> 30:00.847
This castle's impregnable.
Oh, yes. Gulliver!

30:01.489 --> 30:06.279
-This is your empress, my wife.
-A lovely lady for a lovely land.

30:06.529 --> 30:12.126
He has nice manners for a big man.
And so charming!

30:12.609 --> 30:15.442
Sit here, beside us.

30:19.249 --> 30:23.686
-You've never broken eggs with us.
-I've had breakfast.

30:23.889 --> 30:29.566
Breakfast? This isn't breakfast.
This is war.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.847
Give him one.

30:32.889 --> 30:35.722
We found an ostrich egg for you.

30:46.489 --> 30:52.041
No, no, no. You must hold
the small end up. The little end.

30:52.249 --> 30:57.482
That's more than an egg.
It's a matter of life or death.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.601
Certainly is to the chickens
and ostriches.

31:00.889 --> 31:03.164
It's life or death for us.

31:03.489 --> 31:09.121
As a Lilliputian, you must always open
your egg from the small end.

31:09.409 --> 31:13.197
-If it pleases you, I will.
-It pleases me.

31:19.649 --> 31:23.847
We were happy opening our eggs
from the little end...

31:24.049 --> 31:28.486
...until that insane king
of that insane country Blefuscu...

31:28.689 --> 31:32.079
...massed a tremendous army
and navy to force us...

31:32.329 --> 31:37.278
...to open our eggs from
the stupid, idiotic big end!

31:37.529 --> 31:41.442
-That's what this war is about?
-Precisely.

31:41.649 --> 31:47.565
Anybody with sense knows you should
open eggs from the little end.

31:50.529 --> 31:53.680
Let the contest
for prime minister begin!

31:53.889 --> 31:59.521
Hurry! Quickly!
We need a prime minister to go to war.

32:01.009 --> 32:05.082
You appoint a prime minister based
on how he walks a tightrope?

32:05.329 --> 32:06.648
But of course.

32:06.889 --> 32:11.644
A politician must always
maintain his balance in a crisis.

32:11.849 --> 32:15.524
It used to be
a mudslinging contest.

32:15.729 --> 32:20.439
Opponents were buried alive.
This, at least, is colourful.

32:20.889 --> 32:23.244
Now, be quiet, my dear.

32:23.929 --> 32:26.079
The first test.

32:26.329 --> 32:30.561
How many problems can you
handle at one time?

32:31.689 --> 32:35.682
They are juggling the army,
the navy and the budget.

32:35.889 --> 32:39.245
Also, agriculture and high prices.

32:39.929 --> 32:43.285
Distract me!
I can see all the problems.

32:51.369 --> 32:57.046
Excellent! Superb! I can't tell
where the problems are anymore.

32:57.529 --> 33:03.320
Excellent! Your point, Reldresal.
Next, individual performances.

33:03.529 --> 33:06.680
Flimnap, take your position.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.487
Now then, as spokesman
for the emperor...

33:12.689 --> 33:18.559
...you will be asked many embarrassing
questions about taxes and things.

33:19.049 --> 33:21.927
You will have to answer directly...

33:22.169 --> 33:25.878
...but not commit your emperor
to impossible conditions.

33:26.089 --> 33:27.886
You must take action.

33:28.089 --> 33:32.560
Action that pleases the people,
but doesn't upset me.

33:38.649 --> 33:41.243
Brilliant, Flimnap! Brilliant.

33:43.289 --> 33:46.042
Reldresal, take position.

34:22.929 --> 34:24.442
Excuse me.

34:28.289 --> 34:31.964
-Superb!
-I can match that, Your Highness.

34:38.449 --> 34:41.043
Match this, Flimnap.

34:48.809 --> 34:53.438
Well won, Reldresal!
Magnificent footwork!

35:04.929 --> 35:08.478
You'll be the best
prime minister we've had.

35:08.689 --> 35:13.638
-And the most handsome.
-Well done!

35:14.729 --> 35:17.801
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
I was carried away.

35:18.129 --> 35:23.283
-Reldresal cannot hold office.
-You're not being very sporting.

35:23.529 --> 35:29.047
He'll be a prime minister who conspires
with traitorous Gwendolyn Bermogg!

35:29.249 --> 35:33.686
-The Bermoggs were banished.
-I've seen him with her.

35:33.929 --> 35:37.808
-Renounce her, forever!
-She is a dangerous woman.

35:38.209 --> 35:42.885
She and her father refuse to open
their eggs at the small end!

35:43.089 --> 35:48.288
Your Majesty, he is not disloyal
to you. He loves this woman.

35:48.529 --> 35:51.680
Don't meddle in our internal affairs.

35:52.889 --> 35:57.440
You are under arrest
unless you renounce her.

35:58.729 --> 36:00.367
Well?

36:02.129 --> 36:05.439
-Take him to the tower!
-Guards!

36:06.289 --> 36:08.962
Treason, under my very nose!

36:09.169 --> 36:13.799
Galbet, search everywhere.
Seize Bermogg and his daughter.

36:14.009 --> 36:18.446
-Yes, sire.
-But you don't need war or prisons.

36:18.649 --> 36:23.439
Compromise a little. Everyone can
open your eggs in the middle.

36:25.249 --> 36:27.160
The middle?

36:36.489 --> 36:37.888
The middle.

36:44.729 --> 36:48.244
It's impossible! Barbaric!

36:49.009 --> 36:51.477
You don't need Reldresal for a war.

36:51.689 --> 36:55.204
Of course I don't need
a prime minister for a war.

36:55.649 --> 37:00.040
-But I need one to blame if we lose.
-That's not fair.

37:00.449 --> 37:02.917
Of course it isn't. It's war!

37:03.169 --> 37:06.844
And you're not going anywhere
until we win it.

37:07.049 --> 37:11.964
-I thought you were a man of justice.
-I hate justice, but I love law.

37:12.169 --> 37:17.289
Reldresal will be executed unless
you both see the light of triumph...

37:17.529 --> 37:21.442
...of the right might
over the wrong right.

37:47.449 --> 37:49.280
Reldresal.

37:49.969 --> 37:52.278
-Gulliver.
-You must escape.

37:52.689 --> 37:55.283
It's no use.
Gwendolyn won't stay now.

37:55.529 --> 37:57.724
Galbet is looking for them.

37:57.929 --> 38:01.638
But he'll kill them.
Get me out! Get me out!

38:15.289 --> 38:18.042
Hurry! Before the guards come!

38:30.609 --> 38:33.203
Gulliver, this is Gwendolyn.

38:33.409 --> 38:36.685
She's beautiful.
No wonder you risked your life.

38:36.929 --> 38:42.208
-We must go to Blefuscu.
-But they started a war against you.

38:42.409 --> 38:45.242
-Who told you that?
-What does it matter?

38:45.449 --> 38:49.488
He's right. It's ridiculous
to kill people over eggs.

38:49.729 --> 38:53.642
I know. Some people of Blefuscu
are related to us.

38:53.889 --> 38:55.880
The king is the emperor's cousin.

38:56.129 --> 38:59.599
If only they hadn't
had breakfast together.

38:59.929 --> 39:02.568
He's stupid all day,
but you still serve him.

39:03.089 --> 39:08.117
-Please, don't argue.
-But he wants to be so important.

39:08.369 --> 39:12.078
-I won't be a nobody.
-Better than being a dead somebody.

39:12.289 --> 39:15.486
Stay here with him. I'll help you.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.289
Nobody can stop this war.

39:18.529 --> 39:21.601
Why fight for something
you don't believe in?

39:23.729 --> 39:29.440
I'll teach you to attack an old man!
Respect age and position!

39:32.729 --> 39:37.405
Don't kill each other!
There are a thousand ways to eat eggs.

39:38.129 --> 39:41.644
You can scramble them, coddle them
or devil them.

39:41.889 --> 39:46.599
You can bake them, boil them,
Benedict them or poach them.

39:46.809 --> 39:50.006
If you fight over them,
you only smash them.

39:50.209 --> 39:52.279
Stop that fighting!

39:52.529 --> 39:54.804
Kill the traitors at once!

39:55.249 --> 39:59.879
Silence! I've lost my patience!
I'll end this abominable war!

40:00.089 --> 40:01.363
Halt!

40:01.609 --> 40:07.764
I'll end it if you forgive the Bermoggs
and restore Reldresal to office.

40:08.129 --> 40:10.689
And finish my boat!

40:11.129 --> 40:14.838
Anything, as long as
you defeat Blefuscu.

40:15.089 --> 40:19.799
-Which is what I planned all along!
-Yes, Your Majesty.

40:20.889 --> 40:23.323
On to Blefuscu!

40:41.329 --> 40:44.446
Death to Blefuscu!

41:02.329 --> 41:07.244
His lmperial Blefuscunian
Highness approaches!

41:07.449 --> 41:13.206
King of Blefuscu, and of all lesser
lands and people, a protector.

41:16.009 --> 41:19.797
Well, they're certainly
deadly-looking ships.

41:20.009 --> 41:23.445
Now we can sail against Lilliput.

41:23.689 --> 41:26.442
The mightiest armada ever.

41:26.689 --> 41:29.806
If it beats those barbarians
to their knees...

41:30.009 --> 41:33.797
...and forces them to open eggs
at the big end...

41:34.009 --> 41:35.681
...it'll be worth it.

41:39.529 --> 41:42.805
-A giant! He's huge!
-He's huge!

42:05.649 --> 42:09.767
A giant man is stealing our fleet!
Stop him!

42:09.969 --> 42:13.518
-He's stealing our ships!
-Don't let him get away!

42:14.529 --> 42:16.804
He's stealing our navy!

42:22.729 --> 42:25.004
Catapults, fire!

42:42.009 --> 42:46.048
-That's the end of our navy.
-We're defeated.

42:46.289 --> 42:49.042
We're bankrupt.

42:51.849 --> 42:55.842
<i>A wonderful, wonderful,</i>
<i>wonderful fellow is Gulliver</i>

42:56.049 --> 42:59.883
<i>Most powerful, powerful man</i>
<i>In all the world</i>

43:00.129 --> 43:03.678
<i>On Gulliver we depend</i>
<i>He certainly is a friend</i>

43:04.009 --> 43:08.002
<i>He ended the war</i>
<i>He settled the score</i>

43:08.209 --> 43:11.838
<i>He's brave and defiant</i>
<i>A lovable giant is Gulliver</i>

43:12.089 --> 43:15.240
<i>As tall as a mountain</i>
<i>But gentle as can be</i>

43:15.489 --> 43:19.528
<i>So give three cheers for Gulliver</i>
<i>For everyone will agree</i>

43:19.769 --> 43:23.682
<i>A wonderful, wonderful,</i>
<i>Wonderful fellow is he</i>

43:23.889 --> 43:27.279
<i>He's brave and defiant</i>
<i>A lovable giant is Gulliver</i>

43:27.489 --> 43:30.879
<i>As tall as a mountain</i>
<i>But gentle as can be</i>

43:31.089 --> 43:34.877
<i>So give three cheers for Gulliver</i>

43:36.329 --> 43:39.127
We owe our freedom to Gulliver.

43:39.649 --> 43:42.447
He hasn't settled that
stupid egg problem.

43:42.649 --> 43:46.437
Now, Father, don't get us
in trouble again.

43:49.529 --> 43:54.603
Reldresal, you were always
my choice for prime minister.

43:54.809 --> 43:58.245
Glorious victory over
the wrong end of the egg!

43:58.489 --> 44:03.358
-The way you won was enchanting.
-Thank you.

44:03.569 --> 44:07.926
I am going to give you
the hero's medal for heroism.

44:08.129 --> 44:12.645
The Lilliputian Order,
the highest military award!

44:12.969 --> 44:16.359
I pronounce you Nardac!

44:17.089 --> 44:20.240
Ready below? Do you have the medal?

44:21.409 --> 44:23.639
Hurry up! I'm waiting!

44:24.329 --> 44:30.120
Hurry! Our emperor, whose head is
higher than the clouds, awaits!

44:30.369 --> 44:31.563
Here.

44:43.729 --> 44:44.923
Thank you.

44:45.649 --> 44:48.800
Tonight, we celebrate
with dancing and wine.

44:49.009 --> 44:50.727
Then I'll ready my boat.

44:50.929 --> 44:54.239
And between breakfast
and readying your boat...

44:54.449 --> 44:57.885
...l want you to kill
everyone on Blefuscu.

44:58.089 --> 45:00.080
But Lilliput is safe.

45:01.049 --> 45:04.883
-I said, kill them!
-We've won. lsn't that enough?

45:05.089 --> 45:09.685
Then force them to open their eggs
at the little end.

45:09.889 --> 45:14.087
No, I will not degrade anyone.
We don't need vengeance.

45:14.289 --> 45:16.280
I need it!

45:16.529 --> 45:18.997
On to the banquet.

45:33.009 --> 45:35.569
How dare that man disobey you!

45:35.809 --> 45:38.801
He didn't disobey.
His Majesty didn't insist.

45:39.009 --> 45:42.558
I never had to insist before.
It's unheard of.

45:42.809 --> 45:44.845
-Disgraceful.
-Humiliating.

45:45.049 --> 45:48.724
I'm never humiliated.
But it was disgraceful.

45:49.169 --> 45:52.684
-He won the war.
-He shamed the army and navy.

45:52.889 --> 45:54.607
What's war without death?

45:55.049 --> 45:59.361
Where's the sacrifice beyond
the call of duty? The heroism?

45:59.609 --> 46:02.726
I move the prime minister
suggest a way...

46:02.929 --> 46:05.841
...to dispose of this freak.

46:06.129 --> 46:08.438
Well, Reldresal?

46:09.249 --> 46:12.878
If we kill him, there would
be a danger of an epidemic.

46:13.129 --> 46:19.045
-The navy could float him out to sea.
-Too big. Cost too much.

46:19.889 --> 46:21.447
I have it!

46:22.529 --> 46:26.363
We'll send him to Blefuscu
and have them kill him.

46:26.569 --> 46:29.641
Superb idea, Your Majesty.

46:29.889 --> 46:33.279
That way, he's their problem.

46:33.529 --> 46:36.646
It may not be nice, but it's legal.

46:36.849 --> 46:39.886
What if they decide
to use him against us?

46:40.129 --> 46:45.078
Shame! Shame! Shame!
How can you plot against Gulliver?

46:45.329 --> 46:49.845
Now, dear, don't get excited.
Nobody's plotting.

46:50.049 --> 46:55.760
You can't fool me. Criers are out
proclaiming your kindness.

46:55.969 --> 46:58.688
That means someone will be executed.

46:58.929 --> 47:04.640
-Gulliver wouldn't do my bidding!
-That's no excuse for killing him!

47:05.889 --> 47:07.481
Listen.

47:13.609 --> 47:16.885
Such a sweet, gentle song...

47:17.129 --> 47:20.838
...for such a big, powerful man.

47:21.049 --> 47:26.248
-But I sing, and much better.
-Be quiet!

47:42.489 --> 47:47.882
If he'd made a fool of you,
you wouldn't be swaying like a maiden.

47:48.129 --> 47:53.487
-You'd be spitting nails at him.
-Such vanity. Such vanity!

47:53.729 --> 47:57.642
Nothing he does can offend me.

48:29.609 --> 48:31.281
Fire!

48:33.929 --> 48:36.318
Put out the fire!

48:45.009 --> 48:48.046
Stay where you are. I'll put it out.

49:01.849 --> 49:07.879
The uncouth, vile, filthy, evil,
dirty spitting and spewing animal.

49:08.129 --> 49:10.324
As I said, madam. As I said.

49:10.529 --> 49:15.080
Destroy him. He's ruined my dress.
Destroy him!

49:15.329 --> 49:19.845
-Precisely the way we all feel.
-Execute him.

49:20.049 --> 49:25.840
Brilliant!
You're a man of action, Flimnap.

49:28.129 --> 49:30.689
You're accused of treason. Flee!

49:30.889 --> 49:33.687
-The emperor's mad.
-Executioners are coming.

49:33.889 --> 49:38.679
Treason? But I saved Lilliput.
I was even decorated.

49:38.929 --> 49:43.639
You made Galbet jealous. The admiral
hates you for scuttling the fleet.

49:43.849 --> 49:48.240
The empress is furious.
You ruined her dignity and her dress.

49:48.489 --> 49:53.244
I stop wars, put out fires,
feed people...

49:53.449 --> 49:58.603
...give them hope, peace and
prosperity. How can I be a traitor?

49:58.809 --> 50:00.686
Treason, man, treason.

50:00.889 --> 50:05.565
The emperor hates you because
you're more important than he is.

50:05.929 --> 50:08.443
Petty ambition, selfish people.

50:08.689 --> 50:11.840
Go to freedom and eggs
the way you want them.

50:12.049 --> 50:16.042
-I never eat eggs.
-Neither do I. It's the principle.

50:16.249 --> 50:20.083
You caused trouble, endangered
your daughter, to win a point?

50:20.329 --> 50:23.605
You promised the giant
would solve our problems.

50:23.809 --> 50:28.803
He will. You're the biggest.
Make everyone open eggs your way.

50:29.449 --> 50:33.237
No one's big enough
to stop your bickering.

50:33.489 --> 50:35.480
It poisons everything.

50:35.769 --> 50:39.808
Make them think like you.
That will end bickering and war.

50:40.009 --> 50:43.684
Don't you see?
Then I'd be just like the emperor.

50:43.929 --> 50:48.639
And so would you.
Using my strength to oppress others.

50:50.329 --> 50:53.605
-Treason!
-False pride and vanity.

50:53.809 --> 50:57.165
They destroy everything for lovers.
Elizabeth was right.

50:57.689 --> 51:01.477
The only safety is in being obscure,
in being nothing.

51:01.689 --> 51:04.249
-Down with force and power.
-Kill him!

51:04.689 --> 51:07.044
Call the guards!

52:22.289 --> 52:24.883
Please, I need your help.

53:50.089 --> 53:51.920
Halt!

53:52.889 --> 53:57.519
-I must show this to the king.
-See the king's chamberlain.

53:58.809 --> 54:02.961
-Welcome to Brobdingnag.
-Don't be frightened. You're safe.

54:03.169 --> 54:05.160
Is that his name? Gulliver?

54:05.369 --> 54:10.523
Yes, my dear. He belongs to Elizabeth.
She's told us all about him.

54:10.729 --> 54:13.721
Now they're the prized possessions
of your king.

54:13.969 --> 54:18.759
I know how highly you value these
little people, but I must warn you.

54:19.009 --> 54:24.959
Little people are shrunken people,
and shrunken people are dangerous.

54:25.209 --> 54:29.805
Makovan, shrunken people are little
and little people are toys.

54:30.289 --> 54:35.238
And no one in the entire land
of Brobdingnag has them except me.

54:35.489 --> 54:40.358
Take your Gulliver inside.
He needs food and rest.

54:40.569 --> 54:44.528
And the court tailor will
make him new clothes.

54:51.729 --> 54:55.165
You're going to be very rich, my girl.
Very rich.

54:55.409 --> 54:59.561
-What did you say your name was, dear?
-Glumdalclitch.

54:59.809 --> 55:04.599
There you are. That will keep
your family happy for years.

55:05.089 --> 55:08.718
I don't wanna sell him.
I brought him because law says:

55:08.929 --> 55:12.888
"Little people should be brought
to the palace at once."

55:13.089 --> 55:17.128
That's quite right.
Only the king can own little people.

55:17.329 --> 55:20.526
But he's mine. I found him.

55:21.369 --> 55:26.124
My dear child, I've got a surprise
for you. Come along with me.

55:27.809 --> 55:29.800
What do you think of these?

55:30.009 --> 55:33.365
My collection of
the tiniest animals in the world.

55:33.609 --> 55:36.919
-They're very nice.
-Nice?

55:37.129 --> 55:42.123
It's the most unusual collection ever.
Come see my favourite.

55:47.289 --> 55:49.120
See this tiny crocodile?

55:49.329 --> 55:54.528
He's the fiercest fighting flesh
of his size in captivity. Watch.

56:00.129 --> 56:03.724
See how he snaps at it?
That's why we keep him alone.

56:03.929 --> 56:08.559
He'd kill the others instantly.
Now, as a reward...

56:08.809 --> 56:12.688
...I'll give you any of these animals,
except my crocodile.

56:12.969 --> 56:15.961
I don't want any. I want my Gulliver.

56:16.209 --> 56:20.361
Come now, girl. Don't be stubborn.
Your king knows best.

56:20.609 --> 56:25.239
He's a king for grownups. Children
don't have a king to protect them.

56:25.769 --> 56:27.919
I'm everybody's king.

56:28.169 --> 56:31.684
You take things from children,
like all grownups.

56:31.969 --> 56:36.121
They never ask. They just take.

56:38.489 --> 56:43.199
Why not let her stay here? She'll
be an excellent guardian for them.

56:43.729 --> 56:45.924
All right. Then I'll decree...

56:46.169 --> 56:50.321
...that your parents let you
live here. See? I'm your king too.

56:50.729 --> 56:54.927
Thank you.
I'll protect them with my life!

57:06.729 --> 57:12.759
I'll show you your room,
and we'll get you a lovely new dress.

57:12.969 --> 57:16.120
Pages, bring the castle.

57:35.689 --> 57:39.125
You never saw anything
of Pritchard or the crew?

57:39.369 --> 57:42.759
After the <i>Antelope</i> sank,
I washed ashore here.

57:43.009 --> 57:45.921
Let's hope that they were saved too.

57:48.009 --> 57:53.527
I never stopped believing
you were alive. Not for a moment.

57:54.809 --> 57:58.882
When I think of what those
little people might have done to you!

57:59.089 --> 58:02.559
They were vain and selfish.
You're so right.

58:02.809 --> 58:07.929
Wanting to be important
and powerful is meaningless.

58:08.369 --> 58:12.920
Our being together is
all the importance we ever needed.

58:15.889 --> 58:19.723
-Wait!
-Are you all right?

58:19.929 --> 58:24.525
It's Glumdalclitch,
the little girl who found you.

58:25.409 --> 58:29.368
-How do you do? And thank you.
-You're welcome.

58:32.009 --> 58:36.719
I'm going to sleep now,
but if you want anything, just call.

58:36.929 --> 58:38.965
Good night, dear.

58:43.609 --> 58:47.966
lsn't this a beautiful place?
And no mortgage, either.

58:48.209 --> 58:51.724
It's a paradise compared to Wapping.

58:59.609 --> 59:05.127
I don't care where we are as long
as we're together and safe.

59:12.809 --> 59:18.805
-You got your strength back fast.
-Giant food agrees with me.

59:21.009 --> 59:24.524
No, don't. We're not married yet.

59:29.809 --> 59:34.166
Elizabeth, open the door.
Elizabeth!

59:38.209 --> 59:41.121
Glumdalclitch, wake up!

59:59.169 --> 01:00:04.562
-Wake the king. We want to be married.
-Now? But everyone's asleep.

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:06.720
Fetch the king, please.

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:10.723
All right. Stop shouting.

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:18.927
Grownups are silly. And little
grownups are sillier than anybody.

01:00:25.129 --> 01:00:28.166
Wake up in there! Wake up!

01:00:28.409 --> 01:00:31.765
Why arouse everyone?
They want a simple ceremony.

01:00:32.009 --> 01:00:36.525
If I have to be up in the middle
of the night, so does everybody.

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:41.880
-You forgot your slippers.
-I want to do this and go to sleep.

01:00:42.089 --> 01:00:44.125
Don't be so grumpy, dear.

01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:48.647
Remember carrying me off by moonlight?
How impetuous you were!

01:00:48.849 --> 01:00:51.921
How the fires of passion stirred you!

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:55.764
I wish they'd stir now.
It's cold in these halls.

01:00:56.009 --> 01:00:59.126
-Please, Your Majesty.
-Yes, all right.

01:01:01.129 --> 01:01:03.768
-Where are they?
-There, King Brob.

01:01:04.009 --> 01:01:07.365
Pages, get the fire going.
These stones are cold.

01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:10.926
They'll be a delightful couple.
Charming!

01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:13.160
Forgive me for disturbing you.

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:17.328
Quite all right.
You sure you know what you're doing?

01:01:17.529 --> 01:01:20.566
None of your jokes.
You're making them nervous.

01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:25.519
They're supposed to be nervous.
Where's the licence?

01:01:42.809 --> 01:01:45.721
Where'd they go, the little lovers?

01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:49.646
For shame! Shame on all of you!

01:01:49.889 --> 01:01:53.518
Stop this nonsense.
Marry them at once.

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:59.324
You're right, dear.
I'd better marry them at once.

01:01:59.569 --> 01:02:05.360
I pronounce you man and wife
by the authority vested in me, by me.

01:02:05.609 --> 01:02:10.319
Live happily, long life,
lots of children, that sort of thing.

01:02:10.529 --> 01:02:13.327
He should kiss the bride.

01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:19.599
He is, dear.
And now, can we go back to bed?

01:03:18.489 --> 01:03:22.926
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyheads.
It's morning.

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:40.044
"On our honeymoon. Be back soon.
Love, Elizabeth and Lemuel Gulliver."

01:03:48.809 --> 01:03:52.722
Oh, dear. No!

01:04:01.009 --> 01:04:06.561
Darling, if we're gone too long,
Glumdalclitch might get into trouble.

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:11.758
She's a big girl. A very big girl.
She can take care of herself.

01:04:17.769 --> 01:04:21.159
No more cares. No more worries.

01:04:21.369 --> 01:04:27.319
Not a one. I only have to keep you
happy, and I'll work hard to do it.

01:04:27.529 --> 01:04:28.882
Work? What for?

01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:33.766
-To get money to buy food.
-We get all our food free.

01:04:34.009 --> 01:04:38.719
-Then, to pay taxes, at least.
-But there are no taxes on us.

01:04:38.969 --> 01:04:43.963
-Then to save money for our family.
-The king will give us money.

01:04:44.409 --> 01:04:48.925
Yes, but-- I guess so.

01:04:52.209 --> 01:04:56.043
I don't have a thing to worry
about for the rest of my life.

01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:31.768
Gulliver? Elizabeth?
Where are you? Answer me!

01:05:41.769 --> 01:05:44.841
Elizabeth, here I am!

01:05:45.089 --> 01:05:47.728
Down here!

01:05:51.089 --> 01:05:54.126
Glumdalclitch, hurry. Over here.

01:05:56.169 --> 01:06:00.560
-There you are. Where's Gulliver?
-Here I am!

01:06:00.809 --> 01:06:02.527
Down here.

01:06:06.969 --> 01:06:08.925
Down here!

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:37.284
-Don't run away again.
-Thank you for saving me.

01:06:37.489 --> 01:06:40.128
-Why did you run away?
-We didn't run away.

01:06:40.369 --> 01:06:44.328
When you're grown up--
become an adult, you'll understand.

01:06:44.529 --> 01:06:48.966
-You could have been killed.
-We won't do it again.

01:06:49.169 --> 01:06:52.320
I love you both,
but you must do what I say.

01:06:52.529 --> 01:06:57.444
You must behave, or the king
won't let me stay with you.

01:06:57.689 --> 01:07:00.522
I have to take you back right now.

01:07:01.569 --> 01:07:04.925
The queen is terribly worried.

01:07:14.929 --> 01:07:16.885
You upset the queen.

01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:20.923
-You cannot leave without permission.
-Where did you go?

01:07:21.129 --> 01:07:25.441
On our honeymoon. Your country is
as beautiful as England.

01:07:25.689 --> 01:07:30.922
-We won't go out alone again.
-Sensible. She will take care of you.

01:07:31.369 --> 01:07:37.319
-I can take care of Elizabeth.
-Good! I like little men with spunk.

01:07:41.689 --> 01:07:46.717
There. Let's see the alchemist find
a formula to get him out of that.

01:07:46.969 --> 01:07:49.529
A clever move, sire.

01:07:50.929 --> 01:07:53.363
He'll take your rook
if you move there.

01:07:53.609 --> 01:07:57.045
-I beg your pardon?
-I shouldn't have interfered.

01:07:57.609 --> 01:07:59.440
You play chess?

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:01.640
-Quite often.
-He's very good.

01:08:02.129 --> 01:08:05.678
Let's see how good he is.
Take over Makovan's game.

01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:09.441
-May I study the board?
-Of course.

01:08:27.209 --> 01:08:29.723
I'm ready, Your Majesty.

01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:40.238
That's a strange move.

01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:44.277
Really? I'd like
to know more about him.

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:49.721
-What were you in your little country?
-I was a doctor.

01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:52.683
A witchery doctor.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:56.042
No, Makovan. A bodily doctor.

01:08:56.288 --> 01:09:00.680
Baying at the moon or waving a cat
won't cure a bladder ailment.

01:09:01.288 --> 01:09:04.725
Stop that jabbering. It's my move.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.960
Ridiculous. lmpossible.

01:09:35.288 --> 01:09:38.167
I can take your--

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:42.322
No, then you could take my--
This isn't a judging game.

01:09:42.529 --> 01:09:45.520
You'd better let him win.

01:09:45.969 --> 01:09:47.720
You win.

01:09:54.369 --> 01:09:57.167
He can't help it
if he's a bright man.

01:09:57.369 --> 01:10:00.361
It isn't like you to be a bad loser.

01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:04.926
He didn't lose. A witch tricked him
into making false moves.

01:10:05.369 --> 01:10:09.760
But I couldn't have been
beaten by such a tiny witch.

01:10:10.009 --> 01:10:12.079
Maybe he wasn't always small.

01:10:12.329 --> 01:10:16.527
A witch can make himself
any size he wants.

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:20.758
Have you seen the way he kisses
that woman of his?

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:24.763
Witches aren't interested
in that sort of thing.

01:10:25.009 --> 01:10:26.442
Precisely.

01:10:26.729 --> 01:10:32.167
Do married people kiss so happily?
Always, all the time?

01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:37.846
You have a point there, Makovan.

01:10:43.289 --> 01:10:45.519
My stomach!

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:49.323
Oh, it hurts!

01:10:49.889 --> 01:10:54.519
Makovan, get me some herbs quickly.

01:10:55.609 --> 01:10:57.725
They're angry with us.

01:10:57.929 --> 01:11:00.727
Teatime's past,
and they always invited me.

01:11:00.929 --> 01:11:03.159
Is that the price? Loss of dignity?

01:11:03.369 --> 01:11:08.648
-Losing the game isn't losing dignity.
-It's pretending to be stupid.

01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:12.564
-You could try to humour them.
-I could educate them.

01:11:12.809 --> 01:11:15.960
They're backward,
they're in the Middle Ages.

01:11:16.209 --> 01:11:20.566
Don't change them. That'd spoil
everything. We're happy here.

01:11:20.769 --> 01:11:25.320
-We can't be when we're nobodies.
-Try to be equal, they'll hate us.

01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:29.568
If I don't, they'll laugh.
They laugh enough, they'll get bored.

01:11:29.809 --> 01:11:31.959
Then they'll stop laughing.

01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:35.724
Since that's all we're here for,
they'll get rid of us.

01:11:36.969 --> 01:11:40.166
-The queen is ill.
-When? We just left her.

01:11:40.409 --> 01:11:43.128
I saw them carry her to her quarters.

01:11:43.369 --> 01:11:45.519
-Who's caring for her?
-Makovan.

01:11:45.729 --> 01:11:48.562
-She needs a doctor.
-No, please.

01:11:48.769 --> 01:11:53.320
-She's healthy. She just eats too much.
-Please wait!

01:11:54.969 --> 01:11:57.563
Take me to Makovan's laboratory.

01:11:57.769 --> 01:12:02.160
I can't do that. The king won't
allow it. It's forbidden.

01:12:02.369 --> 01:12:04.121
Do as I say!

01:12:04.329 --> 01:12:07.526
It's an evil place filled
with Makovan's magic.

01:12:07.769 --> 01:12:11.523
-I'll turn his magic into medicine.
-No! You'll be killed.

01:12:11.729 --> 01:12:16.928
Don't worry. It's our best chance
to live happily ever after forever.

01:12:17.329 --> 01:12:19.285
Take me there.

01:12:21.609 --> 01:12:27.320
This will soothe you. My special
formula made of spirits of theriac.

01:12:29.129 --> 01:12:33.486
-It's too hot, you fool!
-It must be hot, Your Majesty.

01:12:34.169 --> 01:12:38.526
It's not helping her, Makovan.
Try another formula.

01:12:42.409 --> 01:12:46.721
King Brob? Please, King Brob.
Let Dr. Gulliver help her.

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:50.524
What are you doing here?
Go away, child.

01:12:54.689 --> 01:12:59.080
Just relax. I'm a physician,
a doctor. I'll help you.

01:12:59.369 --> 01:13:00.961
I'm dying.

01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:05.367
You're not dying.
You merely have an upset stomach.

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:07.526
But it aches so.

01:13:07.769 --> 01:13:11.762
I have prepared a solution
of laudanum, a paregoric.

01:13:12.009 --> 01:13:15.843
-Drink it and you'll feel better.
-Are you sure?

01:13:16.049 --> 01:13:19.519
I know it will cure you.
I'm staking my life on it.

01:13:19.769 --> 01:13:23.967
As a physician, I wish I could take
madam's hand and soothe her.

01:13:24.209 --> 01:13:26.120
Yes, doctor.

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:30.682
The medicine is on the table.
Drink it down like a good girl.

01:13:30.889 --> 01:13:32.117
Yes, doctor.

01:13:32.369 --> 01:13:35.361
She's calling for him.
She's losing her mind.

01:13:35.609 --> 01:13:39.158
No, he's going to help her.
He's a doctor.

01:13:39.409 --> 01:13:43.925
Help her? That little witch?
Where is he?

01:13:45.009 --> 01:13:48.922
-Put it down! No, no!
-Away.

01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:55.604
-All of it, madam!
-Yes, doctor.

01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:04.645
He's poisoned her.

01:14:04.889 --> 01:14:07.926
She needed help on the inside,
not the outside.

01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:09.927
There he is!

01:14:10.809 --> 01:14:12.527
Catch him!

01:14:14.369 --> 01:14:16.724
Stop it!

01:14:18.089 --> 01:14:20.125
I feel better already.

01:14:20.329 --> 01:14:23.241
-Are you sure?
-The pain's completely gone.

01:14:23.529 --> 01:14:26.123
You gave me the scare of my life.

01:14:26.329 --> 01:14:30.959
All of you leave.
I wish to consult with Gulliver.

01:14:31.209 --> 01:14:36.329
You may leave too, dear.
Gulliver will be safe here with me.

01:14:40.769 --> 01:14:44.728
I said I'd like a few minutes
alone with my physician.

01:14:44.929 --> 01:14:46.760
-Your what?
-My doctor.

01:14:47.769 --> 01:14:49.964
Dr. Gulliver.

01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:52.962
I can care for you.
Get rid of that man.

01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:56.167
You didn't save my life. He did.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:15:00.322
-I'm your husband.
-I want my doctor.

01:15:00.569 --> 01:15:06.519
All right then. I'll take my doctor.
Dr. Makovan, come with me.

01:15:12.529 --> 01:15:16.727
I told you he was a witch, sire.
Shall I burn him?

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:20.160
It's not fair to burn a witch
without proving it.

01:15:20.409 --> 01:15:23.958
Do you want me to burn him,
then prove him a witch?

01:15:24.209 --> 01:15:26.564
Or shall I prove it, then burn him?

01:15:26.809 --> 01:15:30.119
I don't want the queen upset.
That's what I want.

01:15:30.329 --> 01:15:34.527
Then I shall prove him first,
and then burn him later.

01:15:34.769 --> 01:15:36.327
Is that what you wish?

01:15:36.569 --> 01:15:42.087
Must I always tell you what to do?
Show a little initiative.

01:15:46.049 --> 01:15:50.088
-Can I watch you make him a witch?
-I'm not making him a witch.

01:15:50.289 --> 01:15:52.484
He is one, I'll just prove it.

01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:56.642
Can I watch? Are you going
to burn him afterward?

01:15:56.889 --> 01:16:01.724
Witches are always burned at
midnight, after your bedtime.

01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:18.678
-I was told to bring Gulliver.
-Yes. Just put him on the table.

01:16:18.889 --> 01:16:23.883
Not with that cat here.
I'd better keep him in my basket.

01:16:45.129 --> 01:16:47.085
The thing's a doll!

01:16:48.289 --> 01:16:51.918
-You sent for me? Can I be of service?
-Perhaps.

01:16:52.129 --> 01:16:54.279
This is my daughter, Shrike.

01:16:54.529 --> 01:16:58.317
Darling, this is Glumdalclitch,
guardian of this--

01:16:58.569 --> 01:17:01.242
He's not a doll! He's my little man.

01:17:01.449 --> 01:17:05.283
I'm not big enough to be your father,
but I'm old enough.

01:17:05.489 --> 01:17:08.925
He's silly looking
and squeaks like a mouse.

01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:12.081
You're jealous because
you don't have one.

01:17:12.329 --> 01:17:15.321
Now, girls. You both
go outside and play.

01:17:15.569 --> 01:17:19.687
King Brob told me never
to leave Gulliver.

01:17:19.929 --> 01:17:24.684
Out, I said. There'll be
honey cakes and milk for you later.

01:17:24.929 --> 01:17:30.287
It's all right. We have grownup
scientific matters to discuss.

01:17:40.569 --> 01:17:44.448
-What substance is that?
-Air, water, fire and earth.

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:47.199
Plus the spirits of alchemy?

01:17:47.409 --> 01:17:50.526
-Mercury, sulphur, arsenic.
-You know those?

01:17:50.769 --> 01:17:54.842
-Chemists know our debt to magicians.
-You know magic?

01:17:55.329 --> 01:17:59.880
They called it magic when trying
to change iron into gold.

01:18:00.089 --> 01:18:05.083
-We call it chemistry now.
-You know how to make gold from iron?

01:18:05.289 --> 01:18:08.645
It's easier to make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

01:18:09.009 --> 01:18:10.203
You can do that?

01:18:10.409 --> 01:18:13.446
How did you know?

01:18:16.289 --> 01:18:19.087
Stop that! Girls!

01:18:27.929 --> 01:18:30.489
Stop that. Stop that, I say!

01:18:33.889 --> 01:18:38.565
Easy. Daddy loves his little baby.
There, there.

01:18:39.929 --> 01:18:45.367
He'll put you in the tanks! You'll
turn blue! lt'll prove you're a witch.

01:18:45.569 --> 01:18:48.925
-He'll kill you.
-Don't worry. I can handle it.

01:18:49.129 --> 01:18:54.283
Everyone he says is a witch,
they turn blue in those magic waters.

01:19:04.689 --> 01:19:08.079
What did you do?
You're not a witch, are you?

01:19:08.329 --> 01:19:10.479
No, Glumdalclitch.

01:19:11.369 --> 01:19:13.837
There, there, my sweet.

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:18.759
Leave her alone, you bully.
Sit here and watch me turn him blue.

01:19:19.369 --> 01:19:22.725
Then can I stay up late
and see the fire?

01:19:22.969 --> 01:19:25.164
Turn blue? An innocent man?

01:19:25.409 --> 01:19:28.719
A shrivelled man
who beats the king at chess...

01:19:28.969 --> 01:19:34.521
...cures the queen and makes a silk
purse from a sow's ear must turn blue.

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:37.488
Climb down into that pan.

01:19:45.129 --> 01:19:48.485
That's enough.
Get in the next one.

01:20:00.569 --> 01:20:03.879
-Climb out, Gulliver.
-Yes, sir.

01:20:11.369 --> 01:20:13.883
He didn't turn blue!

01:20:14.369 --> 01:20:18.078
-Incredible!
-Merely a chemical reaction.

01:20:18.729 --> 01:20:21.448
This contains lichen,
which eats algae.

01:20:21.689 --> 01:20:27.321
Anyone stepping into lichen and then
into an alkaline, must turn blue.

01:20:27.569 --> 01:20:29.685
-But you're red.
-Of course.

01:20:29.889 --> 01:20:35.486
I changed the alkaline to acid.
Acid will then turn anything red.

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:58.522
Amazing witchery.
It's still colourless.

01:20:58.769 --> 01:21:02.682
It's the same as your experiment.
It will turn you red.

01:21:02.889 --> 01:21:04.481
Never!

01:21:05.489 --> 01:21:07.525
Gulliver, the cat!

01:21:09.489 --> 01:21:13.323
My cat! You've turned her red.

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:19.678
There, there, my sweet.
Daddy didn't do it, the witch did it.

01:21:44.169 --> 01:21:48.879
Your hair will turn red!
Sure as science, and I'm not a witch.

01:21:49.089 --> 01:21:51.683
It's turning!

01:21:51.929 --> 01:21:56.400
It is, Daddy. It's red.
Your hair.

01:22:12.489 --> 01:22:17.882
Little witch, you'll make
a short but colourful flame.

01:22:19.089 --> 01:22:23.726
Where does he get such power? To turn
my hair red, to cure the queen?

01:22:23.969 --> 01:22:28.599
I say destroy the witch, sire,
before he destroys us.

01:22:28.849 --> 01:22:31.522
-It wasn't magic!
-He's not a witch!

01:22:31.769 --> 01:22:35.523
Invisible spirits. Evil spirits.

01:22:35.769 --> 01:22:38.727
You turned Makovan's hair red.

01:22:38.969 --> 01:22:44.441
-Only because I know chemistry.
-There's no such thing, or I'd know.

01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:48.648
-No one knows it all.
-What he doesn't know, doesn't exist!

01:22:48.889 --> 01:22:52.484
Brobdingnaggians are
the wisest people in the world.

01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:55.243
And I'm their king, understand?

01:22:55.449 --> 01:22:59.727
Admit you never beat me at chess.
By fair means, I mean.

01:22:59.969 --> 01:23:04.281
If I deny what I know,
what I see and what I hear...

01:23:04.929 --> 01:23:07.489
...then I deny all knowledge.

01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:13.082
-And if the queen gets another ache?
-That has nothing to do with this!

01:23:13.289 --> 01:23:16.520
Get that through
your little thick head!

01:23:17.809 --> 01:23:22.041
Deny anything they want,
say anything! Save yourself.

01:23:22.529 --> 01:23:25.680
I can't live without you.

01:23:27.529 --> 01:23:31.681
Open the cage.
I'm ready to confess everything.

01:23:35.569 --> 01:23:37.878
Confess, then.

01:23:38.969 --> 01:23:42.564
I confess that the sun
goes round the Earth.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:46.085
I confess that the world is flat.

01:23:46.929 --> 01:23:49.921
I confess that there is
no such thing as...

01:23:50.169 --> 01:23:53.684
...medicine or science.

01:23:53.889 --> 01:23:57.006
And it would take a witch
to beat me at chess.

01:23:57.529 --> 01:24:00.089
It would take a witch.

01:24:01.049 --> 01:24:03.517
Now he's more guilty than ever.

01:24:03.769 --> 01:24:07.523
There was no medicine,
so he cured the queen with nothing.

01:24:07.769 --> 01:24:12.285
Only a witch could do that.
We must burn him.

01:24:14.769 --> 01:24:17.806
I'm afraid we must. I'm sorry.

01:24:18.049 --> 01:24:21.086
You promised I would be spared.
You lied!

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:25.919
You wear an ignorant's fear.
What you don't know, you destroy.

01:24:26.169 --> 01:24:28.319
-Burn him!
-No!

01:24:28.569 --> 01:24:33.085
Wait. I have a better way
to destroy a witch.

01:24:43.089 --> 01:24:47.605
Remarkable idea, sire.
There won't even be an ash remaining.

01:24:52.369 --> 01:24:55.281
Go back to bed, child.

01:25:05.289 --> 01:25:08.087
She must be spared.
She's done nothing.

01:25:08.329 --> 01:25:10.718
-They are both alike.
-On with it!

01:25:10.969 --> 01:25:14.882
Leave her there for now.
Open the door of the cage.

01:25:22.689 --> 01:25:26.125
Dr. Gulliver! Take this!

01:25:26.969 --> 01:25:31.724
-That's it! That's it!
-Come on!

01:25:37.009 --> 01:25:39.477
Kill him! Get him, get him!

01:25:40.249 --> 01:25:42.205
Hit him again!

01:25:52.169 --> 01:25:54.842
-Kill him!
-Finish it!

01:25:59.129 --> 01:26:01.085
Come on, kill him!

01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:37.839
Come on, get him!

01:27:00.089 --> 01:27:05.686
See what powers he has? The strength
of a dozen his size. Burn him.

01:27:08.769 --> 01:27:10.805
Gulliver! Elizabeth!

01:27:13.169 --> 01:27:15.125
-After them!
-Come on!

01:27:15.369 --> 01:27:18.520
-Don't let them get away!
-Stop them!

01:28:23.249 --> 01:28:26.321
They're coming.
Where shall I hide you?

01:28:26.529 --> 01:28:29.123
You can't stay here.
Animals will eat you.

01:28:29.369 --> 01:28:33.078
You can't do anymore. Save yourself!

01:28:42.569 --> 01:28:45.720
Where are they?
Where did you hide them?

01:28:45.929 --> 01:28:47.681
I don't know!

01:28:47.929 --> 01:28:52.480
Leave the child alone.
They're somewhere here. Find them.

01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:12.484
They must be somewhere here.

01:29:43.769 --> 01:29:48.081
-We can't let them escape.
-Set light to the brush!

01:30:29.169 --> 01:30:32.081
We're going to die here.

01:30:33.569 --> 01:30:36.879
If only I'd listened to you!

01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:41.122
If only I hadn't tried
to make you live my way.

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:44.088
If only I hadn't wanted
everything my way.

01:30:44.729 --> 01:30:46.526
There, at the stream.

01:30:51.729 --> 01:30:54.163
Hurry! Into the basket.

01:32:11.769 --> 01:32:13.885
Where are we?

01:32:15.049 --> 01:32:17.085
I don't know.

01:32:20.729 --> 01:32:23.289
Was it a dream?

01:32:24.569 --> 01:32:28.084
As real as anything we think.

01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:33.684
But the giants.
What if the giants come back?

01:32:35.529 --> 01:32:39.681
They're always with us,
the giants and the Lilliputians.

01:32:39.889 --> 01:32:41.720
lnside us.

01:32:41.969 --> 01:32:45.120
Their terrible world
waiting to take our lives...

01:32:45.369 --> 01:32:50.079
...waiting for us to make a mistake.
To be selfish again.

01:32:50.969 --> 01:32:54.928
How can we bear it?
How can we live with such fear?

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:58.798
With love.
The way Glumdalclitch did.

01:32:59.249 --> 01:33:03.288
Glumdalclitch. What happened to her?

01:33:04.529 --> 01:33:07.089
She's waiting to be born.

01:33:09.929 --> 01:33:11.681
Yes.

01:33:32.969 --> 01:33:36.086
We're back in our world!

01:33:41.289 --> 01:33:43.086
Pardon me. We're lost.

01:33:43.329 --> 01:33:47.880
Perhaps you've heard of our country
from a soldier or sailor.

01:33:48.129 --> 01:33:51.917
-We come from far-off England.
-A town called Wapping.

01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:54.518
Are you barmy? This is England.

01:33:54.969 --> 01:33:58.484
And Wapping's just beyond
that wood.

01:33:58.769 --> 01:34:01.806
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
