WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.139
OOH.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.640
(door closes)

00:06.673 --> 00:08.976
AH, NO, NO, NO.
GET OUT.
AAH!

00:09.009 --> 00:10.710
SAVE YOURSELF.
LITERALLY. GET OUT.
DAD!

00:10.744 --> 00:12.980
(groans)
I NEED THIS BATHROOM.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.882
HONEY, HONEY, IT'S MORNING.
I HAVE THE NEWSPAPER.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.517
THE SEQUENCE
HAS BEEN ENGAGED.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.151
THINGS ARE ABOUT
TO HAPPEN HERE.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.652
WELL, EVE LOCKED
HERSELF IN OURS,

00:19.687 --> 00:21.389
SO... SORRY.
WELL, YOU... (muttering)

00:21.421 --> 00:23.023
EVE!

00:23.057 --> 00:24.892
EVE!

00:24.924 --> 00:26.327
(exhales)
(knocks on door)

00:26.359 --> 00:28.661
EVE, OPEN THE DOOR!
YOUR SISTER'S PRIMER'S ON.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.531
I GUESS SHE'S READY
TO PAINT! COME ON!

00:30.564 --> 00:33.067
DAD, IF I LET HER IN, SHE'LL
HOG THE BATHROOM FOR HOURS.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.834
THAT'S--COME ON.
HEY, THIS IS MY STUDIO
AND THIS IS MY CANVAS,

00:34.867 --> 00:36.369
AND EVERY DAY,
I CREATE A MASTERPIECE.
OH...

00:36.403 --> 00:37.870
LOOK IN THERE.
YOU'RE ALL SET.
THANK YOU.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.740
ALL RIGHT. SHE'S IN,
I'M OUT.
WAIT. DAD. DAD.

00:39.772 --> 00:41.041
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED
TO PUT ALL MY MAKEUP?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.042
SHE'S TAKEN ALL THE DRAWERS.
(stammers)

00:42.076 --> 00:43.376
I HAVE
A VERY METICULOUS SYSTEM.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.045
SEE, EVERYTHING
IS ARRANGED...
OKAY.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.413
AND CAREFULLY SORTED
INTO FOUR SEPARATE ZONES.
I GOT IT.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.082
MOVE AWAY. MOVE AWAY.
LOOK.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.717
YOU GOT A SPARE DRAWER.
JUST PUT ALL THIS STUFF...
(clatters)

00:49.750 --> 00:51.851
MY ZONES!
OH!

00:51.884 --> 00:53.587
THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
PROBLEM NUMBER ONE SOLVED.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.556
ON TO NUMBER TWO.

00:55.589 --> 01:01.195
TIME TO DROP THOSE SHOES.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.363
***

01:03.397 --> 01:04.565
HEY, KYLE,

01:04.598 --> 01:06.200
KNOCK ON ED'S DOOR
AND TELL HIM I GOT A BUDDY

01:06.233 --> 01:07.867
WHO WANTS TO SAY HI
TO HIM, OKAY?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.538
AH, IT'S GONNA BE GREAT
WORKING WITH YOU AGAIN, BUDDY!

01:10.571 --> 01:13.206
(laughing)

01:13.240 --> 01:17.077
MAN, IT HAS BEEN
WAY TOO LONG.

01:17.111 --> 01:19.045
YEAH, LAST PROJECT WE DID
SEEMED TO LAST FOREVER.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.046
(laughs)

01:20.080 --> 01:21.949
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
AH, YEAH.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.585
HEY, MR. B.,
ED SAID HE'S IN A MEETING,

01:24.618 --> 01:27.121
AND THAT HE DOES NOT WANT
TO BE DISTURBED, YOU IDIOT.

01:28.988 --> 01:32.925
(laughs) THAT LAST PART
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR ME.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.262
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.563
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT MY DESIGNS
FOR THE MALL STORES

01:36.597 --> 01:39.566
AND GIVE ME A CALL
WITH THE GOOD NEWS. (laughs)
YOU BET, BUDDY.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.434
SAY HI TO THE WIFE
AND THE THREE BOYS.

01:41.468 --> 01:44.138
HEY...

01:44.172 --> 01:45.639
IT'S THREE GIRLS.

01:45.673 --> 01:49.610
REALLY? GOD, I-I SEEM
TO REMEMBER IT WAS THREE BOYS.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.411
(mouths words)

01:51.444 --> 01:53.446
HEY, MIKE. MIKE...

01:53.480 --> 01:54.947
YOU JUST MISSED BILL McKENDREE.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.151
OH, YEAH. WELL, THIS IS,
UH, ALYSSA WARREN,

01:57.185 --> 01:59.419
FINE YOUNG ARCHITECT
WITH WARREN AND ASSOCIATES.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.120
MIKE BAXTER.
HEY.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.323
HOW ARE YOU?
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING DOWN.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.991
THANK YOU.
YEAH. I WAS JUST
TELLING ALYSSA

02:04.023 --> 02:05.959
ABOUT THAT TIME THAT I GOT
THE--THE TIGER IN SIBERIA

02:05.993 --> 02:08.929
TO EAT SUGAR FROM MY HAND.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.999
YEAH, THE SAD PART
OF THAT STORY--

02:12.032 --> 02:13.766
SUGAR WAS HIS POMERANIAN.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.103
(laughs)

02:16.136 --> 02:18.771
IT WAS THE DOG OR ME,
MIKE.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.642
SUGAR DIED A HERO.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.777
MR. ALZATE
IS A FANTASTIC STORYTELLER.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.681
YES.
QUITE AN ANIMAL LOVER, TOO.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.282
WELL, IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING BOTH OF YOU.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.151
THANKS.
I DO HOPE WE GET
THE CHANCE TO WORK TOGETHER

02:31.185 --> 02:33.153
ON THOSE MALL STORES.
WE'LL TALK IT OVER.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.621
OKAY. GREAT, THANKS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.823
UH, IF ONE OF YOU GUYS

02:35.856 --> 02:37.725
CAN HELP MS. WARREN
TO HER CAR, PLEASE?

02:40.661 --> 02:41.628
AT EASE, FELLAS.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.797
I DESIGN BUILDINGS
FOR A LIVING.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.833
I CAN FIND MY WAY
OUT OF THIS ONE.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.871
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'VE LOOKED
AT ALL THE PROPOSALS, RIGHT?

02:50.903 --> 02:52.673
UH-HUH. YEAH.
I SAY WE GO
WITH BILL McKENDREE

02:52.706 --> 02:54.308
LIKE WE WANTED TO, OKAY?

02:54.342 --> 02:56.042
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE, MIKE.

02:56.075 --> 02:58.212
ALYSSA COULD REALLY EXPAND
OUR BUSINESS, YOU KNOW?

02:58.246 --> 03:00.146
OH, I'LL BET SHE COULD
EXPAND YOUR BUSINESS. YEAH.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.149
ALL RIGHT. STOP THAT.
COME ON NOW, COME ON NOW,

03:02.182 --> 03:03.817
COME ON NOW.
I CHECKED OUT HER PORTFOLIO.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.319
I SAW YOU
CHECKING HER PORTFOLIO.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.020
(speaking indistinctly)
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.556
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN TO ME.
SHE'S A FINE ARCHITECT.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.558
I KNOW THAT. SHE--
TRY TO MAKE THAT SOUND DIRTY.
GO AHEAD.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.858
OKAY.
YEAH. RIGHT.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.060
SHE'S GOT FLOOR PLANS?
YEAH.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.161
I BET YOU GOT PLANS
TO PUT HER ON YOUR FLOOR.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.563
ALL RIGHT.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.164
I COULD DO THIS
ALL DAY, ED.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.236
McKENDREE AND ASSOCIATES
HAVE DONE 15 BUILDINGS FOR US.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.170
AND SINCE IT SEEMS
TO BE YOUR THING,

03:24.204 --> 03:27.674
BILL'S BOOBS ARE A LOT BIGGER
THAN THEY WERE LAST YEAR.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.510
ALL RIGHT. I REALLY
LIKE THAT GIRL'S ENERGY.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.177
(groans)
BUT I'M GONNA
LET YOU DECIDE.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.846
TAKE THESE PROPOSALS HOME.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.080
THERE ARE FIVE ARCHITECTS
IN THERE,

03:34.113 --> 03:36.182
MALE AND FEMALE.
PICK ONE.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.050
I'LL GO
BY MY THREE CRITERIA--

03:38.084 --> 03:39.920
EXPERIENCE, COST...

03:39.952 --> 03:42.955
AND IF THEIR NAME
IS BILL McKENDREE.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.029
HEY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
TOOK BACK THAT MAKEUP DRAWER.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.732
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT
ALL MY BEAUTY STUFF?

03:51.765 --> 03:52.866
"BEAUTY STUFF"?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.268
YOU HAVE LIP GLOSS,
AN EYEBROW PENCIL,

03:54.302 --> 03:55.436
AND A PAPER CLIP.
(scoffs)

03:55.468 --> 03:59.773
THAT PAPER CLIP
IS A PRIMO ZIT POPPER, OKAY?

03:59.807 --> 04:02.409
WHAT? IT'S THE CORNERSTONE
OF MY SKIN CARE REGIMEN.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.711
EVE,
YOU DON'T NEED MAKEUP.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.080
YOU ARE A PERFECT
PLAIN BAGEL, OKAY?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.449
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA COVER
THAT UP WITH CREAM CHEESE, HUH?

04:09.483 --> 04:10.450
YEAH.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.586
SO I COULD BE DELICIOUS?

04:12.620 --> 04:13.886
(laughs) NO. COME ON.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.624
YOU HAVE THIS, LIKE,
UNSPOILED, NATURAL LOOK.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.293
YOU COULD HAVE AN ENTIRE DRAWER
FILLED WITH MAKEUP,

04:19.327 --> 04:21.093
AND YOU STILL
WOULDN'T BE ANY PRETTIER.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.731
YOU SEEM TO BE
TAKING THAT THE WRONG WAY.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.233
(sighs)

04:27.267 --> 04:28.735
HEY, MOM.
HEY, SWEETIE.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.638
WHAT'S WITH THE BLACK DRESS?
SOMEONE DIE?

04:30.670 --> 04:33.105
UH, YEAH.
BRUCE JENKINS FROM MY WORK.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.074
OH. SORRY.

04:35.107 --> 04:37.076
I-I DIDN'T--
NOW I FEEL BAD.

04:37.109 --> 04:38.745
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE FUN OF YOUR DRESS.
YEAH. YEAH.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.414
DON'T WORRY. SHE DOESN'T FEEL
THAT BAD ABOUT JENKINS.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.482
SHE GOT HIS JOB.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.917
YOU DO NOT WANNA BE
AHEAD OF YOUR MOM

04:43.951 --> 04:46.586
ON THE CORPORATE LADDER.
WHOA.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.088
SO, HONEY, DID ANYBODY
FIGURE OUT HOW YOU DID IT?

04:49.121 --> 04:51.090
OH, STOP IT.

04:51.123 --> 04:52.158
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO THIS FUNERAL.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.627
A BUNCH OF SAD GEOLOGISTS
TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.128
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BOOZE
IN THE WORLD

04:56.162 --> 04:58.097
TO MAKE THAT BOAT FLOAT.
(laughs)

04:58.130 --> 05:00.300
IT'LL BE FINE.
YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.303
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD.
I DON'T WANNA UPSTAGE JENKINS.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.340
IT'S--IT'S HIS DAY, YOU KNOW.
MM.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.441
YEAH, HOW COME
YOUR FUNERAL SUIT

05:08.475 --> 05:10.143
LOOKS LIKE
THE ONE YOU GOT MARRIED IN?

05:13.012 --> 05:16.116
PART OF ME DIED THAT DAY.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.017
WELL, PART OF YOU
DIED THAT NIGHT, TOO.

05:18.051 --> 05:22.021
BUT YOU DID HAVE
A LOT TO DRINK. (laughs)
(laughs)

05:22.055 --> 05:23.857
WHAT, UH, WHAT IS
ALL THIS STUFF YOU GOT HERE?

05:23.891 --> 05:26.126
OH, THESE ARE
THE ARCHITECTURAL PROPOSALS

05:26.158 --> 05:28.496
FOR THE NEW STORE AT THE MALL.
OH.

05:28.528 --> 05:31.865
ED WANTS TO GO WITH
THIS YOUNG BABE'S PROPOSAL,

05:31.899 --> 05:34.034
BUT I'M GONNA GO
WITH MY GUY, BILL McKENDREE.

05:34.066 --> 05:36.803
WHAT'S, UH,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE BABE?

05:36.837 --> 05:37.838
WELL,
'CAUSE SHE'S REALLY HOT,

05:37.871 --> 05:38.972
AND I THINK
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

05:39.006 --> 05:40.306
ED'S EVEN--EVEN
INTERESTED IN HER.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.875
MM.
SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE GUYS
STARING AT HER AT WORK.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.142
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

05:43.175 --> 05:45.144
(clicks tongue)
THAT IS REALLY SEXIST.

05:45.177 --> 05:46.480
EH, THEY'RE A BUNCH
OF PIGS,

05:46.514 --> 05:48.314
NOT HIGHLY EVOLVED
LIKE YOUR GUY.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.149
NO, I MEAN YOU.

05:50.182 --> 05:51.818
I THINK YOU'RE DENYING HER
THIS JOB

05:51.852 --> 05:53.720
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.989
HOLD ON. YOU'RE MAD BECAUSE I'M
NOT HIRING THE SMOKIN' HOT BABE?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.858
HOW 'BOUT WE GO
BACK IN TIME

05:57.891 --> 06:00.360
AND REVISIT HIRING THAT
SWEDISH AU PAIR FOR KRISTIN?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.563
WHAT WAS IT? HELGA? OLGA?

06:02.596 --> 06:03.997
WHATEVER HER NAME WAS? WHOA.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.666
HAVE YOU EVEN LOOKED
AT THIS WOMAN'S PROPOSAL?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.001
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S HER PROPOSAL.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.068
PROBABLY SOMEONE
AT HER COMPANY.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.671
THEY SEND
A GOOD-LOOKING GIRL OUT.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.038
IT'S A CLASSIC
BAIT-AND-SWITCH.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.040
SO BECAUSE SHE'S PRETTY,
YOU ASSUME SHE IS INCOMPETENT?

06:14.073 --> 06:16.209
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
COMPETENT.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.012
(door closes)
HONEY, IF PRETTY WOMEN
AREN'T GOOD AT THEIR JOBS,

06:20.047 --> 06:22.249
I MEAN, WHAT--WHAT DOES
THAT SAY ABOUT ME?

06:22.281 --> 06:23.951
(mouths words)

06:28.220 --> 06:31.223
BE A GOOD TIME
FOR A MASSIVE STROKE.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.563
MIKE, I WORRY ALL THE TIME

06:35.596 --> 06:37.864
THAT BECAUSE I'M--
I'M, YOU KNOW, ATTRACTIVE,

06:37.898 --> 06:40.700
THAT MY WORK DOESN'T GET
THE RESPECT IT DESERVES.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.701
COULD GO THE OTHER WAY.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.703
YOU DID GET
THE PROMOTION, RIGHT?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.539
HONEY, I DID NOT GET
THIS PROMOTION

06:45.573 --> 06:47.107
BECAUSE OF MY LOOKS.
(door closes)

06:47.139 --> 06:48.240
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF IT.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.943
I MEAN, A GUY HAD TO DIE,
FOR GOD SAKES.
WHAT?!

06:49.977 --> 06:50.944
OH, COME ON.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.580
COME ON.
IT DOESN'T HURT THAT

06:52.613 --> 06:54.881
THE GUYS IN THE BOARDROOM
HAVE SOME EYE CANDY NOW.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.550
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.884
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
NO, IT--

06:57.918 --> 06:59.218
YOU KNOW YOU GOT IT
GOING ON.

06:59.251 --> 07:00.286
YOU'RE GOOD-LOOKING.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE IT

07:00.319 --> 07:01.555
WHILE YOU STILL GOT IT.
UH-HUH?

07:01.589 --> 07:04.157
'CAUSE IT'S...
IT'S--IT'S....

07:04.958 --> 07:07.060
DO YOU SMELL TOAST?
I SMELL TOAST.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.061
UH-HUH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.597
YOU STAY HOME.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.432
I WILL HAVE MORE FUN
AT THIS FUNERAL WITHOUT YOU.
OH, CUT IT OUT.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.901
COME--NO--
MORE FUN AT A FUNERAL?

07:13.934 --> 07:14.967
I'LL GO WITHOUT YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE--

07:15.002 --> 07:16.470
COME ON. ARE YOU SURE?
(door closes)

07:16.504 --> 07:18.806
THERE'S NO WAY THAT I WOULD
WANT TO BE HERE BY MYSELF.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.808
THIS'LL BE JUST TERRIBLE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.575
I'LL STAY. (chuckles)

07:29.617 --> 07:31.251
(Mandy) HELP!
WHAT?

07:31.283 --> 07:34.087
OKAY, DAD, DON'T FREAK OUT
UNTIL WE HAVE ALL THE FACTS,

07:34.121 --> 07:35.989
BUT SOMETHING HORRIBLE
HAS HAPPENED!

07:36.023 --> 07:37.323
OH, ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN.
NOW WHAT IS IT? ONE AT A TIME.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.993
APPARENTLY, EVE HAS HIDDEN
ALL THE MAKEUP IN THE HOUSE.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.761
(Mike) AH.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.429
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS HOUSE

07:43.463 --> 07:47.433
THAT ROLLS OUT OF BED
LOOKING FABU?

07:47.467 --> 07:50.137
IF I HAVE TO GO THROUGH LIFE
AS A PLAIN BAGEL, SO DO YOU.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.838
GEE. LOOK AT THE TIME.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.608
(singsongy) BETTER HIT THE ROAD
BEFORE WE'RE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.976
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.343
HEY, MAYBE THE ROADS
WILL BE SAFER.

07:57.376 --> 07:58.444
YOU KNOW
THAT REAR-VIEW MIRROR

07:58.478 --> 07:59.445
YOU USE
TO PUT ON YOUR MAKEUP?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
IT ALSO COMES IN HANDY
FOR DRIVING.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.816
NO. NO.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.451
I CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL
LOOKING LIKE THIS. LOOK AT ME.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.653
DON'T LOOK AT ME!

08:06.687 --> 08:08.121
(panting)

08:08.154 --> 08:10.189
GOD! PEOPLE EXPECT THE WHOLE
MANDY BAXTER EXPERIENCE.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.792
IF I SHOW UP
LOOKING LIKE THIS,

08:11.825 --> 08:13.025
IT DIMINISHES MY BRAND--

08:13.060 --> 08:15.194
MANDY.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.297
HEY, COME ON.
YOU LOOK CUTE.

08:17.329 --> 08:19.465
JUST LIKE YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE
A BABY. YOU ALWAYS HAVE.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.133
CUTE? NEXT THING
YOU'RE GONNA SAY

08:21.168 --> 08:22.835
I HAVE A NICE PERSONALITY!

08:24.071 --> 08:26.506
NO. I WASN'T GONNA SAY THAT.

08:31.343 --> 08:33.146
(indistinct conversations)

08:33.180 --> 08:36.315
OH. ANOTHER TEXT
FROM MY HUSBAND.

08:36.348 --> 08:38.151
UGH. I'M BEAUTIFUL.
HE LOVES ME.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.154
IT'S SO INSULTING.
(chuckles)

08:41.188 --> 08:43.223
THE NERVE OF SOME GUYS.
(chuckles)

08:43.255 --> 08:44.991
YEAH. IT WOULDN'T
OCCUR TO HIM TO TEXT ME

08:45.025 --> 08:47.160
THAT I'M COMPETENT
OR SMART.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.730
HE--HE THINKS THAT JUST BECAUSE
I'M A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

08:49.762 --> 08:51.064
THINGS GET HANDED TO ME.
(chuckles)

08:51.098 --> 08:52.733
OH. (chuckles) THANK YOU.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.572
YEAH.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.540
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.
MM-HMM.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.080
UH, EXCUSE ME, MR. LENTZ,

09:07.114 --> 09:09.181
UH, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

09:09.215 --> 09:12.052
VANESSA, WE'RE PEERS NOW.
CALL ME CALVIN.

09:12.084 --> 09:15.055
OH, OKAY. UH, CALVIN...

09:15.087 --> 09:17.224
UH, MAYBE YOU CAN SETTLE
SOMETHING FOR ME

09:17.256 --> 09:18.726
ABOUT MY PROMOTION.

09:18.758 --> 09:22.229
YOU GAVE IT TO ME STRICTLY
BASED ON JOB PERFORMANCE,

09:22.261 --> 09:24.030
CORRECT?
OF COURSE.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.398
ALTHOUGH JENKINS DYING
DIDN'T HURT.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.102
I MEAN YOUR CHANCES.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.203
HE WAS IN SEVERE PAIN THERE
AT THE END.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.606
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.775
BUT--BUT THERE WERE
NO OTHER FACTORS?

09:34.807 --> 09:37.043
I-I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
I'M A WOMAN.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.079
WHICH WAS NOT
A CONSIDERATION AT ALL.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.081
OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
I KNOW YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.449
BETWEEN YOU AND ME...
UH-HUH?

09:43.482 --> 09:45.786
UM, SOMETIMES PEOPLE
ARE INFLUENCED

09:45.818 --> 09:47.553
BY THINGS
THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.091
I GUESS WHAT I'M--
WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS, UH,

09:51.124 --> 09:52.892
DO YOU THINK I'M PRETTY?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.729
DO... DO--EXCUSE ME?

09:55.763 --> 09:56.929
OH, NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING WEIRD.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.065
IT'S JUST MY HUSBAND AND I
HAVE THIS THING...

09:59.099 --> 10:00.133
OKAY.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.601
NO, WAIT--NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. NO, NO.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.070
I'M SORRY. LOOK, I JUST--

10:03.103 --> 10:05.571
(sighs) I JUST NEED TO KNOW
THAT GETTING MY JOB

10:05.605 --> 10:08.808
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
THINKING I'M ATTRACTIVE.
N--

10:08.842 --> 10:11.078
NO, NO, NO.
MY DECISION WAS BASED PURELY

10:11.111 --> 10:13.080
ON JOB PERFORMANCE
AND QUALIFICATIONS.
(exhales)

10:13.113 --> 10:14.982
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
YEAH.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.985
I-I JUST NEEDED TO KNOW
THAT MY LOOKS WEREN'T A FACTOR.
(chuckles)

10:18.017 --> 10:21.754
OH, WAIT. UM, SO WHO--WHO WERE
SOME OF THE OTHER FINALISTS?

10:21.789 --> 10:25.091
THERE WAS ONLY ONE--
DR. KATHY PULLMAN.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.660
(squirts)
UGH.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.505
OH. (chuckles nervously)

10:42.374 --> 10:45.145
(indistinct conversations)

10:45.178 --> 10:47.147
HEY, JENNA.
HEY. (laughs)

10:47.180 --> 10:49.783
HEY, YOU THINK YOU CAN,
UH, YOU CAN HOOK ME UP?

10:49.817 --> 10:51.785
YOU GOT ANY LIP GLOSS?
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE?

10:51.819 --> 10:53.986
(mutters)

10:54.020 --> 10:55.856
GRINDAL! YEAH!

10:55.888 --> 10:57.489
GRINDAL! HEY, MAN.

10:57.523 --> 10:58.792
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.459
I JUST NEED, UH, I NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF EYE LINER.

11:00.492 --> 11:03.195
JUST A COUPLE OF LINES?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.298
YEAH. WHATEVER, GRINDAL!

11:05.331 --> 11:08.168
I REMEMBER WHEN
YOUR NAME WAS DANNY!

11:12.172 --> 11:13.205
(sniffles)

11:16.409 --> 11:18.644
(school bell rings)

11:18.678 --> 11:19.980
OH, MY GOD!
(claps hands)

11:20.012 --> 11:21.048
LOOK, EVERYONE!

11:21.080 --> 11:24.383
OHH!
IT'S KENNY FROM "SOUTH PARK"!

11:24.417 --> 11:25.818
WOW! WAIT A MINUTE.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.154
IT'S... IT'S MANDY BAXTER.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.056
AAH. NO.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.991
SO THIS IS WHAT
SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.861
NO, IT'S--IT'S NOT ME!
IT'S NOT MANDY BAXTER, OKAY?

11:33.894 --> 11:37.529
IT'S AN UGLY EXCHANGE STUDENT
FROM SPAIN! BONJOUR!

11:42.369 --> 11:44.404
OH, HEY, KATHY.
(chuckles)

11:45.604 --> 11:47.173
WHERE YOU PUTTIN'
ALL THAT WINE?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.008
WHAT DO YOU HAVE,
A HOLLOW LEG? (chuckles)

11:49.041 --> 11:52.846
YOU DON'T HAVE
A HOLLOW LEG, DO YOU?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.081
WHY DO YOU KEEP
TALKING TO ME?

11:55.114 --> 11:56.716
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
FOR YEARS IN THE SAME BUILDING,

11:56.750 --> 11:58.084
AND YOU NEVER TALK TO ME.
ALL RIGHT.

11:58.117 --> 12:00.019
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE CHANGED THAT.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.355
LISTEN, DO YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU AND I

12:02.389 --> 12:06.359
WERE THE ONLY TWO FINALISTS
FOR THE JOB... I GOT?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.560
THANKS FOR RUBBING IT IN.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.197
LIKE I HAD ANY CHANCE
AGAINST THE PROM QUEEN.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.099
PROM QUEEN?

12:12.132 --> 12:14.034
BIG HAIR?
AND ALL THOSE TEETH?

12:14.067 --> 12:17.636
MY GOD, YOU MUST HAVE 50
CRAMMED IN THERE.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.108
I HAVE THE USUAL AMOUNT.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.209
HEY, HEY, WHY ARE YOU
SO MAD AT ME?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.878
BECAUSE YOU GOT THE JOB
THAT I WAS MORE QUALIFIED FOR.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.080
BUT IT'S OKAY.
I STILL HAVE MY CATS.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.448
HOW MANY CATS
DO YOU HAVE, VANESSA?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.450
I BET YOU DON'T HAVE SIX.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HOLD ON.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.720
KATHY, LOOK,
I-I AM NOT JUST PRETTY.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.089
I-I HAVE EXCELLENT
QUALIFICATIONS.

12:37.123 --> 12:38.926
OH. SO SHE'S PRETTY
AND SHE KNOWS IT.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.428
ALWAYS A GREAT COMBINATION.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.063
I HAVE A MASTER'S
IN GEOPHYSICS,

12:44.096 --> 12:46.800
WITH A PhD IN GEOLOGY
WITH AN EMPHASIS IN PETROLOGY

12:46.834 --> 12:48.234
FROM OHIO STATE.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.904
WOW. AND ALL I HAVE
IS THE EXACT SAME STUFF...

12:50.938 --> 12:52.071
FROM YALE.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.241
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.
KATHY, LOOK.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.811
WE'RE BOTH TWO
VERY ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.412
I MEAN, THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS,

12:59.446 --> 13:00.780
WE SHOULD BE RUNNING
THIS COMPANY.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.416
(scoffs) NOT ANYTIME SOON.
FROM LENTZ ON UP,

13:03.449 --> 13:06.452
THIS IS A SAUSAGE FEST
AROUND HERE.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.954
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

13:07.988 --> 13:08.988
THAT'S WHY THEY GET AWAY
WITH PAYING YOU

13:09.022 --> 13:10.957
LESS THAN THEY PAID JENKINS.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.094
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.629
LENTZ'S PASSWORD IS ON A POST-IT
ON THE SIDE OF HIS COMPUTER.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.331
(scoffs) WHAT A DUMBASS.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.668
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE A PhD.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.103
NONE OF OUR BOSSES DO.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.636
LENTZ ONLY HAS A MASTER'S...

13:24.671 --> 13:26.806
FROM FLORIDA STATE.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.108
(gasps)

13:28.140 --> 13:29.977
(speaking inaudibly)

13:30.009 --> 13:31.277
(scoffs)

13:31.311 --> 13:32.812
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

13:32.846 --> 13:34.613
WE SHOULD BURY LENTZ
UP TO HIS NECK

13:34.646 --> 13:36.950
IN FORAMINIFERAL OOZE.
(laughs) YEAH.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.151
AND LET
THE LITHIFICATION BEGIN.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.353
OR BURY HIM IN CAT POO.
YEAH.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.990
I KNOW WHERE I CAN GET
A TON OF IT. (laughs)

13:52.164 --> 13:54.367
HEY.
HEY.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.502
(door closes)

13:55.535 --> 13:57.136
HOW WAS THE FUNERAL?

13:57.169 --> 13:59.305
WELL, THEY DID IT RIGHT--

13:59.339 --> 14:01.874
CLOSED CASKET, OPEN BAR.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.345
MAKING A SANDWICH.
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

14:05.378 --> 14:08.147
NO. JENKINS' WIDOW MADE
ALL OF HIS FAVORITE FOODS

14:08.181 --> 14:09.182
FOR THE RECEPTION.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.382
YEAH, NOW SHE COOKS.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.654
HEY, BABY, I'M SORRY WE HAD
THE ARGUMENT ABOUT YOUR WORK.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.189
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY
THAT YOU WEREN'T CAPABLE

14:16.223 --> 14:18.190
OR A SMART SCIENTIST.
NO, IT'S OKAY.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.028
I FOUND OUT WHO I WAS COMPETING
WITH FOR THE PROMOTION,

14:21.060 --> 14:24.864
AND MY LOOKS MAY HAVE BEEN
A TEENY, TINY FACTOR.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.533
THAT'S ALL I WAS SAYING,
YOU KNOW?

14:26.565 --> 14:31.238
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS...
EVOLVED AS YOUR HUSBAND.

14:32.739 --> 14:36.009
BUT WHATEVER GOOD
BEING ATTRACTIVE HAS DONE ME

14:36.043 --> 14:38.378
IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO THE ADVANTAGES

14:38.411 --> 14:40.047
THAT YOU ENJOY EVERY DAY

14:40.080 --> 14:42.515
JUST BY BEING A MAN
IN THIS SOCIETY.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.017
OH, BOY. HERE WE GO.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.751
NO, IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE, MIKE.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.521
MEN HAVE HUGE ADVANTAGES.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.423
MEN HAVE EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.025
YOU MIGHT WANNA TURN AROUND
WHILE I, UH,

14:52.059 --> 14:54.726
HIGH-FIVE BIG JIM
AND THE TWINS.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.864
YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND OUT
AT THE FUNERAL?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
THEY GAVE ME JENKINS' JOB,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.036
BUT I'M NOT MAKING
NEARLY HIS SALARY.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.570
HONEY, IF YOU WANT
MORE MONEY, ASK FOR IT.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.239
IF YOU'RE WORTH IT,
THEY'RE GONNA PAY YOU

15:06.273 --> 15:07.941
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORTH MORE.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.742
NO, NOT WOMEN. WE MAKE
77 CENTS OF THE DOLLAR,

15:09.776 --> 15:12.212
AND THAT'S IF WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GET THE JOB.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.713
YOU EVER HEAR
OF THE GLASS CEILING?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.114
OF COURSE I HAVE.
NEVER SEEN IT,

15:15.148 --> 15:17.749
BECAUSE, OF COURSE,
IT'S MADE OUT OF GLASS.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.786
SO WHAT? IT DOESN'T EXIST?

15:19.818 --> 15:21.221
I DIDN'T SAY
IT DIDN'T EXIST.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.888
BUT A LOT OF WOMEN
HAVE BUSTED THROUGH--

15:22.922 --> 15:24.556
MARGARET THATCHER,
RUTH BADER GINSBURG.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.258
THEY HAD TO WORK
TWICE AS HARD

15:26.293 --> 15:27.893
TO BREAK THROUGH THAT GLASS.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.396
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE LED
WITH THEIR FACES, TOO.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.100
I HEARD THAT.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.435
AND IF THAT GLASS CEILING BROKE?
WHO'S GONNA FIX A GLASS CEILING?

15:35.468 --> 15:36.436
IT'S GONNA BE A GUY.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.404
NO WOMAN'S CLAMORING
FOR THAT JOB

15:38.438 --> 15:40.107
TO CLIMB UP ON A BUILDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

15:40.140 --> 15:41.907
IN A RAINSTORM
AND FIX BROKEN GLASS.

15:41.941 --> 15:42.976
YEAH, 'CAUSE A WOMAN
IS SMART ENOUGH

15:43.010 --> 15:46.113
TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING
WHEN THE STORM HAS PASSED.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.082
THEN THE BASEMENT'S FLOODED.
THEN WHAT YOU GOT? BLACK MOLD.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.618
AND WHO'S GONNA
CLEAN THAT UP? A MAN.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.252
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GET IT. I GET IT.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.254
NO ONE IS CLAMORING
TO CLEAN UP THE BLACK MOLD.
EXACTLY.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.157
BUT A WOMAN JUST MIGHT
BE QUALIFIED

15:57.189 --> 16:00.960
TO DESIGN, UH, I DON'T KNOW,
A STORE IN A MALL?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.429
I'M GOING WITH
McKENDREE AND ASSOCIATES

16:02.462 --> 16:03.430
BECAUSE I KNOW THEM,

16:03.463 --> 16:04.998
AND BEING COMFORTABLE
WITH SOMEBODY

16:05.032 --> 16:06.432
IS A--IS A QUALIFICATION.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.101
IT'S A CATCH-22. YOU WILL NEVER
BE COMFORTABLE AROUND WOMEN

16:09.135 --> 16:11.003
UNLESS YOU START
HIRING THEM.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.171
I LIVE AROUND FOUR WOMEN.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.007
I'M LESS AND LESS COMFORTABLE
EVERY DAY.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.008
HI, MOM AND DAD.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.010
HI, GUYS.
(mouth full) HI.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.110
WE GOT ANYTHING TO EAT?

16:18.145 --> 16:19.678
OH, WAIT.
HERE COMES A PLAIN BAGEL.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.181
HA HA HA.
(speaks indistinctly)

16:22.215 --> 16:25.684
(sighs) SO I HAD
A REALLY STRANGE DAY.
HMM.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.819
I SAW THE WORLD
THROUGH ORDINARY EYES.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.856
STILL BRIGHT AND LUMINOUS,

16:29.888 --> 16:33.459
BUT UNCONTOURED
DUE TO LACK OF EYE LINER.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.028
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL
WITHOUT MAKEUP?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.663
YEAH. IT WAS WEIRD.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.032
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD, LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW, RUN AWAY FROM ME,

16:39.066 --> 16:41.168
BUT IT WAS THE OPPOSITE.
THEY WANTED TO TALK TO ME,

16:41.201 --> 16:43.170
AND THEY TREATED ME
LIKE I WAS SMART.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.208
WELL, YOU'RE BACK HOME NOW
WHERE WE ALL KNOW BETTER.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.511
YOU KNOW, MANDY,
THIS IS FASCINATING.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.879
PEOPLE RESPONDED
TO YOU DIFFERENTLY

16:53.912 --> 16:56.315
BASED ON YOUR APPEARANCE.
HMM.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.186
I WAS JUST MAKING
THAT VERY POINT EARLIER.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.554
I-I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING,
YOU'RE ALL SO DARNED PRETTY.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.392
MUST'VE BEEN GREAT,
SWEETHEART,

17:05.425 --> 17:08.161
FOR PEOPLE TO NOTICE YOU
FOR MORE THAN JUST YOUR LOOKS.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.695
NO. BLAH.
THESE WEIRD NERDY GUYS,

17:09.728 --> 17:11.898
LIKE, SUDDENLY THOUGHT
THEY HAD A SHOT WITH ME.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.900
AND ALL THESE TEACHERS
WERE CALLING ON ME,

17:13.933 --> 17:15.201
EXPECTING ANSWERS.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.836
UGH. IT WAS AWFUL.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.207
BUT I LEARNED SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT TODAY--

17:20.239 --> 17:22.174
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,

17:22.209 --> 17:25.377
BUT IT'S MORE BEAUTIFUL
WHEN YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.183
AND I'VE SEEN WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE EVE FOR A DAY.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.221
AND, YEAH, NOBODY
SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THIS.

17:34.254 --> 17:38.591
YOU CAN HAVE A DRAWER
FOR YOUR MAKEUP, OKAY?

17:38.625 --> 17:40.260
ALL RIGHT.

17:40.292 --> 17:43.062
TIME TO TART MYSELF UP
AND START PULLING C's.
(giggles)

17:44.131 --> 17:45.397
LET'S GRAB A SHOVEL.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.768
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHERE I BURIED YOUR STUFF.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.270
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.071
COULDN'T HAVE MADE
MY POINT ANY CLEARER.

17:52.105 --> 17:56.743
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE IT A BIT MORE CLEAR-ER.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.877
OUR DAUGHTER WENT TO SCHOOL
WITHOUT WEARING MAKEUP,

17:58.910 --> 18:01.046
AND EVERYTHING
WAS UPSIDE DOWN.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.082
CLEARER.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.119
SOME PEOPLE LIKED HER MORE,
SOME PEOPLE LIKED HER LESS,

18:06.153 --> 18:07.954
BUT EVERYONE
JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS

18:07.987 --> 18:09.088
BASED ON HER APPEARANCE,

18:09.121 --> 18:10.289
JUST LIKE YOU DID
WITH THE ARCHITECT.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.723
HERE'S THAT
COMFORTABLE FEELING BACK--

18:11.757 --> 18:14.093
IT'S MIKE'S FAULT.

18:14.126 --> 18:18.398
MIKE, IT'S JUST THE EVERYDAY
COST OF BEING A WOMAN.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.565
DO ME A FAVOR--

18:19.599 --> 18:21.733
GO THROUGH
THOSE ARCHITECTS' PROPOSALS.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.137
DON'T LOOK AT THEIR NAMES,
AND JUST CHOOSE THE BEST ONE.

18:24.171 --> 18:27.607
DO IT FOR ME AND FOR
YOUR THREE DAUGHTERS, OKAY?

18:28.641 --> 18:31.110
MAY THE BEST MAN WIN.

18:33.011 --> 18:34.247
HEY, MIKE,

18:34.281 --> 18:35.981
HEY, I PICKED UP
A DUCK WHISTLE DOWNSTAIRS.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.449
YOU WANNA SEE A COOL TRICK?
SURE.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.986
(duck call quacks)

18:41.019 --> 18:44.257
(laughs)

18:44.291 --> 18:45.758
GUESS HOW I'M BLOWING IT?

18:45.792 --> 18:46.759
I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.761
(laughs)

18:48.795 --> 18:50.163
(quacks)

18:50.197 --> 18:52.165
(quacks)

18:52.199 --> 18:53.166
(laughs)

18:53.200 --> 18:55.302
IT'S JUST ME, MR. B.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.770
HE COULDN'T MAKE A WHISTLE
WORK WITH HIS BUTT.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.139
(laughs) BUT I TRIED!

19:00.173 --> 19:03.142
(laughing)

19:06.145 --> 19:09.281
HEY, I THOUGHT
I'D TAKE YOU TO LUNCH.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.450
YEAH?
WE CAN CROSS SOME T's,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.284
DOT SOME I's
ON THAT MALL DEAL, HUH?

19:12.318 --> 19:13.986
YOU KNOW, IF WE GO
TO BOB'S CLASSY LADY,

19:14.020 --> 19:17.989
WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE
SOME T's WITH OUR OWN EYES!
(door closes)

19:18.024 --> 19:20.460
AH, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GONNA WANNA TAKE ME TO LUNCH.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.793
I LOOKED AT THE PROPOSALS,

19:21.828 --> 19:23.830
AND--AND, UH, I'M GONNA GO
WITH ANOTHER ARCHITECT

19:23.862 --> 19:25.130
FOR THE MALL STORES.

19:25.164 --> 19:29.134
WAIT. OH, YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING. COME ON, MIKE.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.802
I'VE BEEN YOUR GUY
FOR YEARS.

19:30.837 --> 19:31.971
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:32.003 --> 19:33.539
WELL, THE FREE MARKET
HAPPENED, BILL.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.541
I TOOK AN UNBIASED LOOK
AT ALL THE PROPOSALS

19:35.574 --> 19:37.976
AND I WENT FOR THE BEST
PRESENTATION AT THE BEST PRICE.

19:38.009 --> 19:40.313
YOU JUST DIDN'T BRING
YOUR "A" GAME THIS TIME.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.647
I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.182
YOU KNOW MY WORK.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.650
I UNDERSTAND, BUT THIS IS
A BUSINESS DECISION.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.185
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST LOST
FAIR AND SQUARE.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.653
THAT'S IT.
NOTHING PERSONAL, BILL.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.224
(exhales) DID ALYSSA WARREN
GET THE JOB?

19:51.258 --> 19:52.692
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

19:52.725 --> 19:55.194
SHE'S OUT THERE
FLIRTING WITH ED RIGHT NOW.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.496
COME ON. LOOK AT HER.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.198
SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE ANY GOOD.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.200
SOME GUY AT HER FIRM'S PROBABLY
DOING ALL THE WORK FOR HER.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.870
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HIRE
THAT GUY TO WORK FOR YOU.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.038
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.408
OL' MIKE BAXTER
WENT P.C. ON ME.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.342
HIRED YOURSELF
A LADY ARCHITECT.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.079
WELL... (chuckles)
WATCH YOUR BACK, BUDDY.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.213
TODAY THEY GOT ME.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.215
TOMORROW,
THEY'RE COMING AFTER YOU.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.520
I LIVE WITH FOUR OF 'EM.
THEY GOT ME A LONG TIME AGO.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.921
SHOULD'VE HAD BOYS.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.197
MIKE BAXTER HERE--
DOWN HERE--

20:32.231 --> 20:34.099
FOR OUTDOOR MAN,
WHERE WE CARRY

20:34.132 --> 20:36.034
WHATEVER YOU NEED
FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE HUNTING,

20:36.067 --> 20:39.872
WHETHER IT BE MOOSE,
DEER, OR MANATEE.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.375
WHERE THE--WHERE THE HELL'S
MY MANATEE?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.209
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD EATIN'.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.413
BUT THESE DAYS,
EVERYONE'S GUNNING

20:46.446 --> 20:50.950
FOR THE AMERICAN WHITE MALE.
HELLO.

20:50.982 --> 20:52.885
I'M AN AMERICAN WHITE MALE.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.554
THIS SPECIES NEVER GETS CREDIT
FOR ALL IT'S DONE,

20:55.587 --> 20:57.890
LIKE BUILDING HOSPITALS,
ROADS, ELECTRICAL GRID.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.225
THIS SPECIES GETS BLAMED
FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S NASTY--

21:00.259 --> 21:01.226
WARS, GLOBAL WARMING,

21:01.260 --> 21:04.897
HILLBILLY SHOWS
ABOUT MAKING MOONSHINE.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.134
LOOK OUT, MEN. THE LADIES
ARE SNAPPING AT YOUR HEELS.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.069
AND DID YOU KNOW THAT WOMEN
OUTNUMBER MEN IN COLLEGES,

21:10.102 --> 21:13.305
57% TO 43%?

21:13.340 --> 21:16.576
THAT ADDS UP TO 100%.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.446
MEN, WE HAVE TO KEEP BUSTING
OUR ASS TO STAY IN THIS THING.

21:19.478 --> 21:20.780
OTHERWISE, WE'LL END UP STUFFED

21:20.813 --> 21:23.415
AND MOUNTED
ON SOME WOMAN'S WALL.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.417
YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE

21:25.452 --> 21:27.185
THAT HILLBILLY SHOW, MR. B.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.122
OF COURSE YOU DO, KYLE.
