WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.960
Previously on Prison Break:We leave tonight.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.266
It's got no electricity

00:05.309 --> 00:06.310
and no running water.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.182
A hundred bucks a month.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.357
Deal.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.532
You ready?

00:12.925 --> 00:14.666
I hope this works, Papi.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.017
MICHAEL:
That book of yours-- it's
just a bunch of coordinates

00:17.060 --> 00:18.105
in there, right?

00:18.148 --> 00:19.454
Among other things.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.672
Does your father still have

00:20.716 --> 00:22.152
that phone number I gave you?

00:22.196 --> 00:23.240
I think so.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.155
Well, tell him
to call my brother.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.549
Papa, make that call
for my friend.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.767
The American?

00:28.811 --> 00:30.291
If time runs out,

00:30.334 --> 00:32.206
and I don't have the second half
of those coordinates,

00:32.249 --> 00:35.252
LJ and the senorita
stop breathing.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.733
[speaking Spanish]

00:41.258 --> 00:43.043
Just wish there was
another way to do this.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.916
To save LJ without
handing Whistler over.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.353
Look, man, that's it--
there isn't.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.225
What is that?

00:51.268 --> 00:52.530
MICHAEL:
Kesslivol.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.576
When heated
to a certain degree,

00:54.619 --> 00:55.968
it eats through steel.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.927
As soon as Linc
cuts the power, we go.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.755
What about the backup generator?

00:59.798 --> 01:01.583
There's a lag
from when the power cuts out

01:01.626 --> 01:03.019
to when the generator
kicks back in.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.108
How long a lag
we talking about here?

01:05.152 --> 01:05.978
30 seconds.

01:20.384 --> 01:23.213
We only have 30 seconds. Go.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.317
[man speaking Spanish]

01:40.361 --> 01:41.275
Move it, move it.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.628
Shh! Shh!

01:47.498 --> 01:48.630
Come on.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.375
Let's go.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.465
Okay, let's go.Not yet.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.684
We have to go now.
We're running out of time.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.295
Trust me.

02:12.784 --> 02:16.136
[man yells in Spanish]

02:20.792 --> 02:22.446
WHISTLER:
Come on, Mate.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.621
Is there a holdup,
Michael?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.275
Just a little
bit longer.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.081
[men yelling in Spanish]

02:50.648 --> 02:52.868
What happened?

02:52.911 --> 02:54.086
They got caught.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.309
[alarm blaring]

03:04.184 --> 03:06.186
What's going on?Shut up.

03:08.797 --> 03:09.972
What, what...?

03:10.015 --> 03:11.321
Don't try anything.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.328
MAN:
Bring 'em over here!
Bring 'em over here!

03:19.721 --> 03:21.766
You-- on your knees, get down!

03:21.810 --> 03:24.029
Don't move,

03:24.073 --> 03:25.205
or you're like
your friend over here.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.818
[men yelling in Spanish,
alarm blaring]

03:29.861 --> 03:31.341
What's going on, Michael?

03:35.476 --> 03:39.219
[speaking Spanish]

03:39.262 --> 03:41.873
This sure as hell
better work out.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.748
For everyone's sake.

04:06.463 --> 04:09.292
[speaking Spanish]

04:09.336 --> 04:10.337
You two,

04:10.380 --> 04:12.034
on your feet.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.301
Where the hell's
Scofield?Shut it.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.868
If Scofield doesn't
get caught,

04:19.911 --> 04:21.435
he could still fix this mess.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.627
WHISTLER:
What do we do now?

04:39.670 --> 04:42.325
The lights are on, they know
about the escape...What's your plan, Michael?

04:42.369 --> 04:43.457
This is the plan.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.805
WHISTLER:
Michael, how the hell

05:27.849 --> 05:29.198
is getting caught your plan?

05:29.241 --> 05:30.765
You told them they had
30 seconds to get across,

05:30.808 --> 05:32.941
when you knew the generator
was going to kick in sooner.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.986
I must have miscalculated.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.379
We've got about ten minutes
till the sun rises.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.772
And there are soldiers
out there, okay.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.121
They'll take count. We got
to get back to the yard.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.341
We're not going anywhere.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.864
It's almost time.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.792
[keypad beeping]

05:57.835 --> 06:00.316
[line ringing]

06:00.360 --> 06:03.014
[vibrating buzz]

06:07.410 --> 06:08.890
What do you think you're doing?

06:08.933 --> 06:10.108
Nothing. It's just
probably my wife.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.067
You know, we live
a couple miles away

06:12.110 --> 06:13.982
and she must have
heard the sirens, so...

06:14.025 --> 06:15.592
You can make your calls
when I'm done with you.

06:15.636 --> 06:18.334
What else you got?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.250
Sucre?I'm not here.
Say what you got to say.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.686
Sucre, where the hell
are you?!

06:22.730 --> 06:24.079
We're counting on you
to be here!

06:24.122 --> 06:25.950
If you're not there,
we're dead, man.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.039
Now call me back, please.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.477
[beeping]

06:34.437 --> 06:37.484
Put these with
his personal effects.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.182
What's going on out there?

06:40.225 --> 06:41.923
Some prisoners tried
to escape.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.011
Did they get out?

06:43.054 --> 06:45.230
They got caught.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.102
One of them got shot
pretty bad.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.242
[phone ringing]

06:57.286 --> 06:58.418
Sucre?

06:58.461 --> 06:59.636
Sucre?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.072
No, it is Alphonso Gallego.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.422
You where you need to be?

07:02.465 --> 07:03.945
Yes.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.599
I left the Suburban
on the side of the road.

07:05.642 --> 07:06.817
The keys are in the wheel well.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.297
Are they still there?
Check 'em out.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.352
Ah! They're here.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.658
Good, good.

07:21.702 --> 07:22.877
You will be here too,

07:22.920 --> 07:23.965
on the 312?

07:24.008 --> 07:25.793
Yeah, yeah, the 312.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.447
See you there.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.322
[alarm blaring,
men shouting in Spanish]

07:40.198 --> 07:43.550
These all the men?Si, senor.

07:46.074 --> 07:49.599
Tell me, how did
you get there?

07:49.643 --> 07:52.123
How did you get out there?

07:52.167 --> 07:55.562
Don't want
to tell me?

08:00.871 --> 08:01.829
[groans]

08:01.872 --> 08:03.134
How did you
get out there?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.398
[gagging]

08:06.442 --> 08:07.399
A tunnel.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.271
Where?

08:11.969 --> 08:13.188
Under Lechero's room.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.150
Show me.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.252
How much longer?

08:34.296 --> 08:36.559
It's just a matter
of seconds now.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.518
Come on...

08:47.701 --> 08:48.789
We got to move, Michael.

08:48.832 --> 08:49.964
Michael?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.319
The door.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.755
I don't know
the combination.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.148
Then improvise.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.236
This is insane.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.071
Let's go.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.381
Vamanos.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.561

Hurry!

10:47.211 --> 10:49.170
[men shouting in Spanish
in distance]

10:54.044 --> 10:56.481
Son of a bitch
sold us out!

11:11.148 --> 11:12.802
It wasn't me!

11:12.846 --> 11:14.021
It was Scofield! He did this!

11:14.064 --> 11:16.153
Just check the
yard-- him,

11:16.197 --> 11:18.155
Whistler, Mahone
and that basketball kid--

11:18.199 --> 11:20.549
none of 'em
will be there!

11:45.269 --> 11:49.056
[over walkie-talkie]:
This is Captain Sojo.
Other inmates are missing.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.622
I want a post-and-protect

11:50.666 --> 11:53.713
around the entire perimeter
of the prison.

11:59.109 --> 12:02.634
[men shouting in Spanish
in distance]

12:35.885 --> 12:37.887
General, we
see no one.

12:37.931 --> 12:41.064
Are you sure there's
prisoners out here?

12:43.719 --> 12:46.243
You won't find the prisoners
here in no-man's-land

12:46.287 --> 12:48.245
because they're already gone.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.262

13:35.466 --> 13:37.164
[officer yelling in Spanish]

13:41.081 --> 13:42.647
This way.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.089
Off the bus now!

13:49.132 --> 13:50.655
Get off the bus!

13:50.699 --> 13:51.831
He was about
this tall...

14:02.102 --> 14:03.843
Now!

14:06.193 --> 14:07.498
Come on. Move it! Go!

14:26.430 --> 14:28.171
[grunts, groans]

14:28.215 --> 14:30.739
What's wrong?

14:30.782 --> 14:33.611
It's my ankle!
I've torn it apart!

14:33.655 --> 14:35.613
Come on. It's not that far!
Help me out!

14:35.657 --> 14:37.050
Mr. Whistler, we'll drag you
by your hair

14:37.093 --> 14:38.921
because we got to go!

14:38.965 --> 14:40.923
I'll slow you down. Just go!
Just leave me!

14:40.967 --> 14:42.925
We both know
that's not an option.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.753
It's only a quarter of
a mile to the beach.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.755
If we stick to the bush,
we can make it out.

14:46.798 --> 14:47.712
A little help?

14:47.756 --> 14:50.454
Go. Come on!
Let's go.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.908
Hey!

15:10.561 --> 15:12.389
Hey. We only have
a few minutes.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.738
We got soldiers
right behind us.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.653
Cops as well.We got what we need?

15:15.697 --> 15:17.612
Yeah, we got
what we need.What do we need?

15:18.961 --> 15:20.832
Always picking up
the strays, huh?

15:20.876 --> 15:21.833
This way.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.706
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.456
[panting][man yelling in Spanish]

15:47.076 --> 15:50.166
Listen, Michael, if you
think the Company's just going

15:50.210 --> 15:51.776
to let you swap me for your
nephew, you're mistaken.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.865
Shut up.Once they get hold of me,

15:53.909 --> 15:55.258
they're gonna kill all of you,

15:55.302 --> 15:57.782
and I don't want Sofia
caught in the cross fire.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.917
Listen, just let me go.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.919
I'll contact them, I promise.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.269
I'll say I'll turn myself
in once I know LJ's safe.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.880
Hey! You got no say in what
happens to my son! You got it?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.406
We don't need
a suntan.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.277
We need to get lost.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.554
The military patrols all
the roads around the prison.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.034
You didn't consider a boat?

16:32.078 --> 16:34.123
They show up here and we're
ten yards off the shore,

16:34.167 --> 16:35.168
we're target practice.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.257
We need to be invisible.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.258
Five guys, four tanks.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.521
Sucks for you, Mahone.

16:40.564 --> 16:43.132
Linc and I will share.

16:43.176 --> 16:46.005
Toss your boots in the box.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.747
[phone rings]

16:49.791 --> 16:52.054
Yeah?

16:52.098 --> 16:54.274
Tell me you have him.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.101
Yeah, I got him.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.537
Where's my son?

16:56.580 --> 16:59.018
With me.
Put him on the phone now.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.238
Say something.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.936
I'll be there soon.
Just don't hurt anyone.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.286
You happy?

17:06.329 --> 17:08.940
You have 20 minutes
to meet me in Panama City

17:08.984 --> 17:10.072
where we agreed.

17:10.116 --> 17:10.942
We'll be there.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.474
Hey, I need
to put my book in there.

17:20.517 --> 17:23.564
My book... my book!

17:27.611 --> 17:29.309
It must have fell out
of my pocket.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.137
I thought you already
figured out the coordinates.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.008
Well, I didn't memorize them!
I wrote them in the book!

17:33.052 --> 17:35.097
I'm pretty sure they're
still looking for us, guys.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.403
It's gone. Now get
in the damn water.

17:36.446 --> 17:40.276
Would you please?
It's a picture of my son.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.408
Can you, uh...

17:41.451 --> 17:43.671
In the bag?

17:43.714 --> 17:45.455
Screw you, Mahone.

17:45.499 --> 17:46.587
Let's go.

17:49.372 --> 17:53.376
McGrady. McGrady?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.291
I don't swim so good.

17:55.335 --> 17:56.640
What?

17:56.684 --> 17:58.729
Too bad, kid,
you're getting wet-- get in.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.035
Look it's all right.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.602
We'll share tanks.
Just hold onto me

18:01.645 --> 18:04.083
and we'll switch off back and
forth, ten seconds apiece.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.780
Come on.
Let's go.

19:17.068 --> 19:20.202
[grunts, coughs]Where is Scofield?!

19:20.246 --> 19:23.684
I don't know!
He didn't tell me nothing!

39:29.323 --> 39:31.412
He's a convict! He's
a piece of garbage.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.806
I don't know anything
about this Michael Scofield guy.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.329
GUARD:
General.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.200
Here is everything we have
on the escaped prisoners.

39:42.554 --> 39:45.774
You don't know Michael Scofield,
is that right, Jorge?

39:45.818 --> 39:47.341
Yes.

39:47.385 --> 39:51.301
You sure you don't want to
change your story, Fernando?

39:58.004 --> 39:59.266
MAHONE:
Hey.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.530
This should help make
you a decent brace.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.402
Thank you.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.844
Hey.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.976
Should be able to see
them coming from up here.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.935
You know, Linc...

40:17.502 --> 40:18.938
you did great.

40:23.595 --> 40:25.248
Thanks.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.381
I just want LJ back, you know?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.470
It's just a matter of time.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.776
Yeah.

40:30.819 --> 40:32.995
Considering I don't have
a pony in this race...

40:34.214 --> 40:36.259
I guess this is where
I say good-bye.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.228
You think I'm gonna let you
just walk out of here...

40:48.271 --> 40:50.143
after what
you did to us?

40:50.186 --> 40:51.927
After what you did
to my dad?

40:54.582 --> 40:55.583
No.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.455
I was gonna kill
you at the beach,

40:57.498 --> 41:00.806
but I didn't want to
do anything that was
gonna get us caught.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.069
You shot my dad in the back.
I'm gonna give you

41:03.112 --> 41:05.811
the courtesy
you never gave him.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.595
Now turn around.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.512
Turn around.

41:11.556 --> 41:14.341
MAHONE:
Linc, think about
what you're doing.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.738
I was told to choose
between your family and mine.

41:19.781 --> 41:20.913
That was my option.

41:20.956 --> 41:22.436
I chose mine.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.439
Go to hell.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.398
Linc, you don't
have to do this.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.314
[glass breaking]

41:35.710 --> 41:36.581
Mahone!

42:08.961 --> 42:10.353
Hey! My truck!

42:11.659 --> 42:13.182
LINCOLN:
No!

42:25.238 --> 42:27.240
What are we gonna do now?
