00:00.810 --> 00:01.910
(Male announcer) Previously
on Hell's Kitchen...

00:02.355 --> 00:04.154
After another disappointing loss,

00:04.155 --> 00:05.621
the Blue Team moped...

00:05.622 --> 00:06.955
I'm ready to win a service.

00:06.955 --> 00:07.954
Me too.

00:07.955 --> 00:08.953
I'm tired of losing.

00:08.954 --> 00:10.155
(Announcer) While Krupa rejoiced...

00:10.156 --> 00:12.987
[Laughing] How many
glasses have you had?

00:12.988 --> 00:14.354
[Belches] Damn.

00:14.355 --> 00:15.653
(Announcer) In a challenge,

00:15.654 --> 00:17.222
the test of the chef's
creativity with beer...

00:17.223 --> 00:19.220
- That doesn't have any flavor.
- The sauce is weird.

00:19.221 --> 00:20.422
(Announcer) Krupa's
dish was dropped...

00:20.423 --> 00:22.121
Krupa's [Bleep] was nasty.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.422
(Announcer) But
Tommy's tasty duck...

00:23.423 --> 00:24.554
Good job.

00:24.555 --> 00:26.321
Congratulations goes to Blue Team.

00:26.322 --> 00:27.487
Yeah!

00:27.488 --> 00:28.522
(Announcer) Gave the
Blue Team the win

00:28.523 --> 00:30.487
and Tommy a boost in confidence.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.953
Successfully proves the fact
that I'm just the most awesome

00:32.954 --> 00:33.953
of anyone in the world.

00:33.954 --> 00:35.220
(Announcer) At dinner service,

00:35.221 --> 00:36.453
in the red kitchen,

00:36.454 --> 00:38.253
Let's go, ladies.
We can do this tonight!

00:38.254 --> 00:39.388
(Announcer) While
Jamie struggled...

00:39.389 --> 00:41.587
Jamie! I got one sea bass.

00:41.588 --> 00:43.254
Pink and undercooked!

00:43.255 --> 00:44.555
(Announcer) Elise pushed hard.

00:44.556 --> 00:47.154
- How long?
- Three minutes, I said!

00:47.155 --> 00:48.186
Well, if no one else is gonna talk,

00:48.187 --> 00:49.653
I'm gonna talk for everybody.

00:49.654 --> 00:50.888
(Announcer) As for Krupa...

00:50.889 --> 00:52.154
Oh, my God.

00:52.155 --> 00:53.821
(Announcer) She was a disaster.

00:53.822 --> 00:54.853
It's overcooked.

00:54.854 --> 00:55.922
She was a nightmare.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.254
What are you doing?

00:57.255 --> 00:58.887
I'm fragile, chef. I'm sorry.

00:58.888 --> 01:01.320
(Announcer) In the blue kitchen,
Natalie's scallops...

01:01.321 --> 01:03.288
How many scallops are
we having to refire?

01:03.289 --> 01:05.486
Natalie, wake up!

01:05.488 --> 01:06.888
(Announcer) And
Jonathon's Wellingtons

01:06.889 --> 01:09.587
had chef Ramsay
thoroughly frustrated.

01:09.588 --> 01:11.288
- Jonathon!
- It's a little overcooked.

01:11.289 --> 01:13.954
- It won't happen again.
- You...and you...

01:13.955 --> 01:15.121
[Bleep] Off!

01:15.122 --> 01:16.687
I'm so sick of this [Bleep].

01:16.688 --> 01:18.721
(Announcer) So chef
Ramsay made both teams

01:18.722 --> 01:20.721
nominate two chefs for elimination.

01:20.722 --> 01:21.753
The Red Team nominated...

01:21.754 --> 01:22.755
- Krupa.
(Announcer) - And...

01:22.756 --> 01:24.254
Jamie.

01:24.255 --> 01:26.255
(Announcer) And they joined
nominees Jonathon and Natalie...

01:26.256 --> 01:27.587
In the end, it was...

01:27.588 --> 01:28.621
Krupa.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.922
(Announcer) Who saw her dream

01:29.923 --> 01:32.121
of being head chef at BLT
Steak in New York City

01:32.122 --> 01:34.122
come to an end.

the continuation of Hell's Kitchen.

02:41.455 --> 02:42.988
(Gordon) We're not done yet.

02:46.022 --> 02:48.387
One of the big issues
that you've all got

02:48.388 --> 02:51.154
is the lack of leadership.

02:51.155 --> 02:52.687
So tonight,

02:52.688 --> 02:54.487
I want you to nominate

02:54.488 --> 02:58.087
the one chef on your
team  who has the best

02:58.088 --> 02:59.754
leadership skills.

02:59.755 --> 03:01.687
- Got it?
(All) -Yes, chef.

03:01.688 --> 03:03.887
And give me an answer first
thing in the morning.

03:03.888 --> 03:06.321
Get out of here.

03:06.322 --> 03:09.121
(Elizabeth) I think we definitely
do need a leader,

03:09.122 --> 03:11.187
someone that can, like,
pull us all together

03:11.188 --> 03:12.487
so we're more of a team.

03:12.488 --> 03:14.521
I know who my vote is.

03:14.522 --> 03:16.287
- Who?
- You.

03:16.288 --> 03:17.553
- Me?
- Yeah, that's my vote.

03:17.554 --> 03:18.555
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

03:18.556 --> 03:19.954
Hands-down.

03:19.955 --> 03:21.921
Really? Me?
Really?

03:21.922 --> 03:23.254
Are you sure?

03:23.255 --> 03:25.187
You're talking about me, right?

03:25.188 --> 03:26.987
Does anybody have any thoughts

03:26.988 --> 03:28.555
on who we want to
put up as a leader?

03:28.556 --> 03:30.554
I nominate Will.

03:30.555 --> 03:31.888
I was gonna go with you, man.

03:31.889 --> 03:34.521
The fact that you've helped
me the entire time here.

03:34.522 --> 03:35.786
Will helps everyone.
Will's our leader.

03:35.787 --> 03:37.355
You need to be able
to follow the lead.

03:37.356 --> 03:39.121
So, I mean, will wants the lead.

03:39.122 --> 03:42.354
I'll follow will until I
feel I need the lead.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.553
I'd like to thank you all for
giving me the opportunity

03:44.554 --> 03:46.155
to lead us to the [Bleep]
promised land, bro.

03:46.156 --> 03:47.554
I'm 100% game, man.

03:47.555 --> 03:49.654
I came here to stand in the front.

03:49.655 --> 03:52.121
No problem. I will do that.

03:52.122 --> 03:53.721
That was easy.

03:53.722 --> 03:55.355
(Announcer) While the Blue
Team makes a decision quickly,

03:55.356 --> 03:57.321
the Red Team is struggling.

03:57.322 --> 03:59.621
We have a task upon
our hands, ladies.

03:59.622 --> 04:01.188
Well, two of us already voted.

04:05.455 --> 04:07.355
Jennifer.

04:11.322 --> 04:12.721
I actually think I am.

04:12.722 --> 04:14.254
I mean, I talk...

04:14.255 --> 04:17.553
And I'm vocal with people.

04:17.555 --> 04:18.553
[Snickers]

04:18.555 --> 04:20.120
Like, you're kidding me.

04:20.122 --> 04:22.421
There's no way she could
lead a horse to water,

04:22.422 --> 04:23.555
much less make him drink.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.087
Carrie's voting for herself.

04:25.088 --> 04:26.454
Is that funny?

04:26.455 --> 04:29.121
I think it's funny.

04:29.122 --> 04:30.455
What is your definition
of a leader, Elise?

04:30.456 --> 04:33.687
Not you.

04:33.688 --> 04:35.120
Maybe 'cause I don't do
it like you, Elise...

04:35.121 --> 04:36.522
has nothing to do with
how it is with me.

04:36.523 --> 04:38.254
I just wouldn't  trust somebody

04:38.255 --> 04:40.020
who doesn't have basic
food knowledge.

04:40.021 --> 04:41.653
[Chuckles]  I wouldn't
feel comfortable

04:41.654 --> 04:42.920
asking someone for help

04:42.921 --> 04:45.288
if I feel like they're being
condescending about it

04:45.289 --> 04:47.654
or laughing about it.
That's you, Lise.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.653
That's not true,
because I help people

04:48.654 --> 04:49.788
when they need it.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.921
Yeah, you help throw
'em under the bus.

04:52.922 --> 04:56.587
Do I want to be the leader of
this motley crew that I have?

04:56.588 --> 04:59.188
I don't know if they
really can do it.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.522
(Announcer) After the
late-night team meetings,

05:05.523 --> 05:08.487
chef Ramsay is anxious to get
an answer to his question.

05:08.488 --> 05:09.921
- Paul!
- Yes, chef?

05:09.922 --> 05:11.354
Are you a leader?

05:11.355 --> 05:12.722
No, chef. Will's gonna step
up to the plate, chef.

05:12.723 --> 05:13.987
Good.

05:13.988 --> 05:15.854
Red Team. Elise...

05:15.855 --> 05:17.720
Who have you picked
as the team leader?

05:17.721 --> 05:18.822
Jennifer, chef.

05:18.823 --> 05:20.588
- Jennifer?!
Both: - Yes, chef.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.587
The strength of a great leader

05:23.588 --> 05:24.822
is to understand the
highs and the lows,

05:24.823 --> 05:27.254
the weaks and the strengths
in their team.

05:27.255 --> 05:30.154
So, Jennifer, on your team,

05:30.155 --> 05:33.021
who is the weakest leader?

05:33.022 --> 05:34.821
I would say it would be Carrie.

05:34.822 --> 05:37.054
Wow.

05:37.055 --> 05:38.086
Chef, I disagree
with that totally.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.120
I do know how to lead.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.653
I know how to pull people together.

05:40.654 --> 05:42.253
I know how to be  that cheerleader

05:42.254 --> 05:43.255
and get people when
they're in a funk.

05:43.256 --> 05:44.588
Okay.

05:45.788 --> 05:47.021
Uh, Will!

05:47.022 --> 05:48.187
Yes, chef?

05:48.188 --> 05:49.854
Which member of your team

05:49.855 --> 05:53.687
has the least  leadership skills?

05:53.688 --> 05:54.687
Tommy.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.254
Being a leader,

05:56.255 --> 05:57.286
you have to be vocal.

05:57.287 --> 05:58.786
You have to be able to communicate.

05:58.787 --> 06:00.255
You have to listen to everything
that's going on around you.

06:00.256 --> 06:02.621
And I think that's exactly
where Tommy falters.

06:02.622 --> 06:04.154
I think I am a good communicator.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.154
I am vocal.

06:05.155 --> 06:06.754
I know I can lead a kitchen staff.

06:06.755 --> 06:09.721
I'm gonna give Tommy and Carrie

06:09.722 --> 06:11.421
a chance to prove to their team

06:11.422 --> 06:14.787
that they have  great
leadership qualities.

06:14.788 --> 06:16.454
There always is a twist.

06:16.455 --> 06:18.788
This is Hell's Kitchen.
This isn't predictable kitchen.

06:18.789 --> 06:20.621
Each team is gonna take

06:20.622 --> 06:24.221
five stunning American
comfort classics

06:24.222 --> 06:26.321
and evolve them into
something truly special.

06:26.322 --> 06:28.887
Tommy and Carrie, you will decide

06:28.888 --> 06:31.354
what everyone on your
team is cooking.

06:31.355 --> 06:34.721
They will come to you for
leadership direction.

06:34.722 --> 06:35.787
Start it up.

06:35.788 --> 06:36.787
Yes, chef.

06:36.788 --> 06:38.821
45 minutes, starts from now!

06:38.822 --> 06:39.987
Let's go!

06:39.988 --> 06:41.420
(Announcer) For today's challenge,

06:41.421 --> 06:43.688
chef Ramsay is not only
testing the chef's creativity

06:43.689 --> 06:46.521
as they try to evolve five
American comfort classics...

06:46.522 --> 06:47.987
All right, ladies.

06:47.988 --> 06:49.588
(Announcer) But he's also
giving Tommy and Carrie

06:49.589 --> 06:52.221
an opportunity to prove
that they can lead.

06:52.222 --> 06:54.020
I think you should go
with the hamburger. Okay.

06:54.021 --> 06:55.220
Chicken noodle soup.

06:55.221 --> 06:56.820
And then how about a
Cobb salad, baby?

06:56.821 --> 06:57.955
Can you knock it out? Okay.

06:57.956 --> 06:59.421
I'm wanna do the pizza.

06:59.422 --> 07:00.920
I want you to do spaghetti
and meatballs, okay?

07:00.921 --> 07:01.287
You got it?

07:01.288 --> 07:02.686
I don't feel comfortable
with spaghetti.

07:02.687 --> 07:03.822
I wanted to do pizza.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.820
I wanna be the one
to cook the pizza,

07:05.821 --> 07:07.453
but, as usual, Carrie
doesn't listen

07:07.454 --> 07:08.688
to anyone's suggestions.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.287
She wants to do the pizza herself,

07:10.288 --> 07:12.122
but I know that she's
gonna [Bleep] it up.

07:12.123 --> 07:14.821
(Announcer) While Elise
predictably has a problem

07:14.822 --> 07:17.287
with Carrie's game plan,
the blue kitchen...

07:17.288 --> 07:17.701
Tommy.

07:17.702 --> 07:19.354
(Announcer) Is still
waiting for one.

07:19.355 --> 07:19.988
Tommy. Guy.

07:19.989 --> 07:21.254
What do you wanna do?

07:21.255 --> 07:23.187
- What is this called here?
- Endive.

07:23.188 --> 07:24.620
With Tommy, the engine's running,

07:24.621 --> 07:26.320
but there's no one
behind the wheel.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.320
I'm doing the Cobb salad.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.453
Okay, what are you gonna do?

07:28.454 --> 07:29.486
I think I'm gonna do the burger.

07:29.487 --> 07:30.686
What kind of meat do you want?

07:30.687 --> 07:32.188
We have ground strip...
you wanna do the pizza?

07:32.189 --> 07:33.721
I would love to do the pizza,

07:33.722 --> 07:35.620
but I would like to do
a barbecued pork pizza

07:35.621 --> 07:36.953
with a little Southern flair.

07:36.954 --> 07:38.220
It depends if we have time.
I mean, I wanna do...

07:38.221 --> 07:39.455
I wanna do, like, a caprino pizza.

07:39.456 --> 07:41.721
I wanna do like a... like
a toasted pistachio.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.421
Like, uh, truffle oil and honey.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.887
Tommy has got the worst idea.

07:45.888 --> 07:48.254
So, how, exactly,
is this gonna work?

07:48.255 --> 07:50.020
All right, what do you
want to use on the pizza

07:50.021 --> 07:51.286
as far as ingredients?

07:51.287 --> 07:52.988
What do you want to use
for the toppings?

07:52.989 --> 07:54.887
Let me just get this grill hot.

07:54.888 --> 07:57.421
I already told John
the four ingredients

07:57.422 --> 07:58.820
for the flat bread pizza.

07:58.821 --> 08:00.086
But I don't think he's
ever made one before.

08:00.087 --> 08:01.288
I think he just didn't
want to admit it.

08:01.289 --> 08:02.487
I'm...baffled.

08:02.488 --> 08:04.386
Man, I need to know
what's going on it.

08:04.387 --> 08:06.186
I'm standing there
trying to talk to him.

08:06.187 --> 08:08.053
Time's getting low and
he's... he's basically

08:08.054 --> 08:09.122
[bleep] Ignoring me.

08:09.123 --> 08:10.821
Tommy, what's going on?

08:10.822 --> 08:13.887
(Announcer) While Jonathon struggles
to keep Tommy's attention...

08:13.888 --> 08:15.620
How's everybody feeling?
Are we doing good?

08:15.621 --> 08:16.655
(Announcer) The Red
Team wouldn't mind

08:16.656 --> 08:18.887
a little less attention
from Carrie.

08:18.888 --> 08:20.654
I like a lightly-breaded chicken.

08:20.655 --> 08:22.686
- Breaded chicken?
- Yeah, I think that would be yummy.

08:22.687 --> 08:24.655
All right, Elise, how we
thinking on the pasta?

08:24.656 --> 08:26.121
What are you thinking?

08:26.122 --> 08:27.286
I'm thinking that I'd
rather have done pizza.

08:27.287 --> 08:28.920
Are you making some
meatballs right now?

08:28.921 --> 08:30.286
Yeah, Carrie, I'm gonna
make meatballs.

08:30.287 --> 08:31.755
Carrie's not helping the cause.

08:31.756 --> 08:33.753
She's the wrong person
to try to lead someone,

08:33.754 --> 08:34.885
'cause she can't lead herself.

08:34.886 --> 08:36.621
Elise, do you have
your pasta dropped?

08:36.623 --> 08:38.721
My pasta is dropped.
Do you have your pizza in?

08:38.722 --> 08:39.722
Oh, crapola.

08:43.355 --> 08:46.054
(Announcer) While Carrie hurries
to get her pizza ready,

08:46.055 --> 08:47.886
over in the blue
kitchen, Jonathon...

08:47.887 --> 08:50.020
Come on, Tommy, we got a little
bit of thick cheese over here.

08:50.021 --> 08:51.586
- It's gonna take time  to melt.
- All right.

08:51.587 --> 08:53.420
(Announcer) Is waiting
on Tommy's direction.

08:53.421 --> 08:54.422
Five minutes. Let's go.

08:54.423 --> 08:55.922
That's gotta go in now, guys.

08:55.923 --> 08:57.920
Like, now, now, now.
I'm waiting on you, man.

08:57.921 --> 08:58.986
You got that cheese on there?

08:58.987 --> 09:00.322
I ground up the mozzarella, man.

09:00.323 --> 09:01.654
[Bleep].

09:01.655 --> 09:03.287
Well, you didn't talk to me, man.

09:03.288 --> 09:05.086
(Tommy) It's so easy to
make a flatbread pizza.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.355
It's just, when somebody doesn't
want to do what we're doing,

09:07.356 --> 09:08.887
that makes it difficult.

09:08.888 --> 09:10.720
Just like this, and put
it on right afterwards.

09:10.721 --> 09:11.920
Hurry the [Bleep] up!

09:11.921 --> 09:13.586
Come on, ladies.
We gotta start plating.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.855
(Gordon)  30 seconds to go!

09:14.856 --> 09:16.554
I'm going in the [Bleep] oven.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.220
I'm freaking out about
my pizza right now.

09:18.221 --> 09:19.653
(Gordon) Ten seconds to go!

09:19.654 --> 09:20.655
[Bleep] Kidding me.

09:20.656 --> 09:22.754
Come on, pasta, please, please.

09:22.755 --> 09:24.255
Five! Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

09:24.256 --> 09:25.987
I need the micro basil.

09:25.988 --> 09:27.921
Four!  come on, guys.

09:27.922 --> 09:29.221
Three! Son of a bitch.

09:29.222 --> 09:30.422
[Bleep], my pasta.

09:30.423 --> 09:31.854
Two!

09:31.855 --> 09:33.255
One! And serve!

09:36.288 --> 09:37.421
Okay!

09:37.422 --> 09:39.987
I have invited to judge
this challenge...

09:39.988 --> 09:41.022
Ladies and gentlemen...

09:45.688 --> 09:47.022
Wolfgang Puck!

09:48.888 --> 09:49.954
Oh, my God.

09:49.955 --> 09:51.854
That's right!

09:51.855 --> 09:53.354
- Oh, my God.
- Hello.

09:53.355 --> 09:55.387
Like, big stars came to my eyes.

09:55.388 --> 09:57.188
I couldn't believe we
had Wolfgang Puck.

09:57.189 --> 09:59.187
Good morning.

09:59.188 --> 10:00.621
I'm, like...

10:00.622 --> 10:03.254
Speechless right now.

10:03.255 --> 10:04.654
Whew.

10:04.655 --> 10:05.886
Good to see you. How are you?

10:05.887 --> 10:07.286
I'm excellent. I'm hungry.

10:07.287 --> 10:08.455
Good. Good, good, good.

10:08.456 --> 10:09.455
Wow.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.587
Oh, my God.

10:11.588 --> 10:12.788
Red Team, Blue Team,
let's start off

10:12.789 --> 10:14.286
with the battle of the burgers.

10:14.287 --> 10:15.455
Let's go, please.

10:15.456 --> 10:18.021
(Announcer) First up
is Jamie versus Tommy.

10:18.022 --> 10:20.286
Jamie, please present your
dish to chef, please.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.622
Chef, I have lamb burger sliders

10:21.623 --> 10:24.954
with a red onion comfiture
and a rosemary garlic oil.

10:24.955 --> 10:25.955
Okay.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.487
To me, a little overdone.

10:31.488 --> 10:32.554
But...

10:32.555 --> 10:34.254
You know,

10:34.255 --> 10:36.321
it has good flavor.

10:36.322 --> 10:38.154
I think the pickled onions...

10:38.155 --> 10:39.886
the sweet and sour in it.
It's not bad.

10:39.887 --> 10:41.420
That was probably one
of the best complements

10:41.421 --> 10:42.453
I've ever gotten.

10:42.454 --> 10:43.688
Well, it's, uh, Tommy.

10:43.689 --> 10:45.554
Tried to put a, uh,

10:45.555 --> 10:48.187
like a Japanese spin on
an American classic.

10:48.188 --> 10:50.321
The meat is cooked
out of soy caramel

10:50.322 --> 10:51.555
with a little candied ginger.

10:51.556 --> 10:54.621
You know, show me your hand.

10:54.622 --> 10:56.487
Look how colorful that looks.

10:56.488 --> 10:57.754
Mm-hmm.

10:57.755 --> 10:59.022
That's how I like my
burgers to look too.

10:59.023 --> 11:00.054
Okay.

11:00.055 --> 11:01.122
Yeah, so next time,

11:01.123 --> 11:03.354
a little color in here.

11:03.355 --> 11:04.455
Should we taste it?

11:04.456 --> 11:05.922
(Tommy)  go for it.

11:08.555 --> 11:10.754
You know, it doesn't
have the "wow."

11:10.755 --> 11:12.387
So, chef,

11:12.388 --> 11:13.953
if you had to choose,
which one would it be?

11:13.954 --> 11:15.588
You know what?
I would choose the...

11:15.589 --> 11:16.887
Red Team.

11:16.888 --> 11:18.020
((Gordon)  well done.

11:18.021 --> 11:19.155
Thank you, chef.  great.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.453
Great start, ladies.

11:20.454 --> 11:21.888
Good job, Jamie.  Good job, Jamie.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.854
Okay, let's go. Next up,

11:23.855 --> 11:25.221
Elizabeth, Natalie.

11:25.222 --> 11:27.321
Cobb salad, please.

11:27.322 --> 11:28.687
Um, Elizabeth first.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.121
I made, like, a
traditional Cobb salad.

11:31.122 --> 11:33.888
I did a honey-dijon dressing.

11:36.522 --> 11:38.288
It's a good-tasting salad.

11:40.055 --> 11:41.753
But you have to look
what you have in here.

11:41.754 --> 11:43.820
Could you not have presented
it with some finesse?

11:43.821 --> 11:45.055
We want a little bit

11:45.056 --> 11:46.687
more invention

11:46.688 --> 11:48.321
from a classic.

11:48.322 --> 11:49.721
(Gordon)  Natalie.

11:49.722 --> 11:50.754
What I have

11:50.755 --> 11:51.922
is kind of a remix on a Cobb salad.

11:51.923 --> 11:54.687
I decided to use salmon
instead of chicken.

11:54.688 --> 11:56.322
Let's taste, please.

11:59.688 --> 12:01.521
I wouldn't call it a Cobb salad.

12:01.522 --> 12:04.287
It's not really  what
we have in our mind

12:04.288 --> 12:05.587
as a Cobb salad.

12:05.588 --> 12:07.087
But, I mean, I would

12:07.088 --> 12:08.453
give it a different name,

12:08.454 --> 12:09.722
and I could serve it, probably,
in one of our restaurants.

12:09.723 --> 12:10.787
Thank you.

12:10.788 --> 12:12.055
(Gordon) Okay, who did you like?

12:12.056 --> 12:13.422
I think, uh...

12:15.722 --> 12:17.021
The Blue Team.

12:17.022 --> 12:18.520
(Gordon)  Blue Team,
congratulations.

12:18.521 --> 12:19.888
Thank you so much.
(Gordon) I agree with that.

12:19.889 --> 12:21.254
Nice. Thank you, chef.

12:21.255 --> 12:24.087
She didn't make a Cobb salad.

12:24.088 --> 12:26.422
So I was a little confused
that they gave the point

12:26.423 --> 12:28.687
to somebody who did a
salmon entree, yeah.

12:28.688 --> 12:30.488
(Announcer) With the
score tied at one.

12:30.489 --> 12:32.221
Will and Elise...

12:32.222 --> 12:33.353
Elise, present your
spaghetti and meatball.

12:33.354 --> 12:34.920
(Announcer) Are each
looking to impress

12:34.921 --> 12:36.055
with their unique take

12:36.056 --> 12:37.721
on this classic dish.

12:37.722 --> 12:39.254
I would say it looks like a mess.

12:39.255 --> 12:40.287
Okay.

12:40.288 --> 12:42.054
Did you drop it and picked it up?

12:42.055 --> 12:44.787
Okay, will, please.

12:44.788 --> 12:47.621
Ohh. No.

12:47.622 --> 12:48.755
It's lacking sauce.

12:48.756 --> 12:49.921
No point?

12:49.922 --> 12:51.153
(Wolfgang)  I don't know.

12:51.154 --> 12:52.155
I wasn't impressed with them.

12:52.156 --> 12:53.821
Both of them.

12:53.822 --> 12:56.155
(Announcer) Both will and Elise's
dishes have disappointed,

12:56.156 --> 12:57.921
scoring no points for either team.

12:57.922 --> 13:00.554
With the scores still tied at one,

13:00.555 --> 13:03.121
it's Jennifer's southwestern
chicken noodle soup...

13:03.122 --> 13:04.388
I think it's a good soup.

13:04.389 --> 13:05.721
Thank you, chef.

13:05.722 --> 13:07.253
(Announcer) Versus
Paul's Italian-style

13:07.254 --> 13:08.288
chicken noodle soup.

13:08.289 --> 13:09.321
It looks good.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.954
But I think the flavor falls flat.

13:11.955 --> 13:13.355
My heart hit the [Bleep] floor.

13:13.356 --> 13:15.287
I was like, "nooo!"

13:15.288 --> 13:16.587
Red Team or Blue Team?

13:16.588 --> 13:17.587
Red Team.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.820
Wow. Thank you, chef.

13:18.821 --> 13:20.086
Point to the red.
Good job, Jennifer.

13:20.087 --> 13:21.186
Good job, ladies.

13:21.187 --> 13:22.455
I cooked for Wolfgang Puck

13:22.456 --> 13:25.421
and he didn't throw
up in trash barrel.

13:25.422 --> 13:26.821
He actually liked it.

13:26.822 --> 13:28.987
Okay, the last dish.

13:28.988 --> 13:30.020
It's the battle of the pizzas.
Let's go.

13:30.021 --> 13:31.286
- Pizzas.
- I'm excited.

13:31.287 --> 13:32.520
(Gordon) Let's hope they're good.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.055
I don't even want to
take that pizza up.

13:35.088 --> 13:36.422
Please present your dish.

13:38.555 --> 13:39.688
Okay, let's go.

13:39.689 --> 13:41.087
I'm not taking it up.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.621
You can take it up.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.488
Come on, man. Just take it up, bro.

13:44.489 --> 13:45.887
Come on, guys!

13:45.888 --> 13:46.953
[Bleep].  For God's sake.

13:46.954 --> 13:47.955
Let's go, please, guys.

13:47.956 --> 13:48.955
Take 'em up.

13:48.956 --> 13:50.554
I'm not taking it up.

13:50.555 --> 13:51.755
Come on!

13:53.255 --> 13:54.322
Jonathon!

13:58.449 --> 14:00.848
(Announcer) Today, the
chefs have been tested

14:00.849 --> 14:02.714
to be innovative with
American comfort classics.

14:02.715 --> 14:04.649
The Red Team is leading two to one.

14:04.650 --> 14:06.448
Okay, the last dish. Let's go.

14:06.449 --> 14:07.949
(Announcer) But
Jonathon is not willing

14:07.950 --> 14:10.015
to bring up the pizza to be judged

14:10.016 --> 14:11.014
by Wolfgang Puck.

14:11.015 --> 14:12.016
I'm not taking it up.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.981
Come on, guys!

14:13.982 --> 14:15.582
- I'm not taking it up.
- Just take it up, bro.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.681
For God's sake, come on!

14:17.682 --> 14:20.249
[Sighs] It looks like [Bleep], man.

14:22.149 --> 14:23.247
Dear, oh, dear. Right.

14:23.248 --> 14:24.982
Uh, Carrie, please
present your pizza

14:24.983 --> 14:26.481
to chef, thank you.

14:26.482 --> 14:28.281
I did a shrimp basil pesto

14:28.282 --> 14:30.082
with blistered heirloom tomatoes.

14:33.882 --> 14:35.116
Did you taste it?

14:35.117 --> 14:36.148
Yes, I did.

14:36.149 --> 14:37.981
It looks raw and it tastes raw.

14:37.982 --> 14:38.982
It's undercooked.

14:40.582 --> 14:41.582
That's embarrassing.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.949
Take it back.

14:44.482 --> 14:46.715
I'm... I'm embarrassed.

14:46.716 --> 14:48.314
I shouldn't... that's
embarrassing, I know.

14:48.315 --> 14:50.449
You come to spago, I'll show
you how to make a pizza, okay?

14:50.450 --> 14:52.348
Unbelievable.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.714
Her dish was [Bleep] raw!

14:53.715 --> 14:55.482
Blue Team, we're taking this
home, man, we got this!

14:57.549 --> 14:58.849
Jonathon, please present.

15:00.282 --> 15:01.281
What is that?

15:01.282 --> 15:03.948
I have a flat bread pizza, uh...

15:03.949 --> 15:05.981
- What is that?
- Ahh.

15:05.982 --> 15:09.248
What... where did you see
a pizza like this?

15:09.249 --> 15:11.648
I-I haven't, chef,  honestly.

15:11.649 --> 15:12.714
I mean, if you go to Italy,

15:12.715 --> 15:14.082
they arrest you for
that, you know that.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.780
[Sniffs] It smells like honey.

15:16.781 --> 15:18.182
Honey and white truffle oil.

15:18.183 --> 15:21.182
Everything we don't need
on the pizza, you put on.

15:22.349 --> 15:23.949
I'm standing here
looking like an ass

15:23.950 --> 15:26.315
because, uh, I had no
say-so in the pizza.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.216
Basically, I just
rolled the dough out.

15:28.217 --> 15:30.148
I thought it was a great pizza,

15:30.149 --> 15:31.482
had it been cooked properly.

15:31.483 --> 15:33.015
Jonathon is an idiot.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.716
I'm not gonna even ask
chef to taste it.

15:34.717 --> 15:37.081
Take that away.

15:37.082 --> 15:39.081
Looked like a [Bleep] ass again.

15:39.082 --> 15:40.416
(Gordon)  dear, oh, dear.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.848
That's disgusting.

15:41.849 --> 15:43.448
Jonathon and Carrie...

15:43.449 --> 15:45.182
I'm embarrassed, chef.
I mean, honestly?

15:45.183 --> 15:47.315
Jonathon, what have you
got to say for yourself?

15:47.316 --> 15:49.481
Jonathon gets [Bleep]
again by a teammate

15:49.482 --> 15:51.081
and made to look  like an ass.

15:51.082 --> 15:52.649
Honestly, I could flip  this whole

15:52.650 --> 15:55.282
[bleep] Dining room
upside down, man.

15:56.382 --> 15:57.516
(Gordon)  okay.

15:57.517 --> 15:59.249
No point?

16:00.616 --> 16:01.681
No. Wow.

16:01.682 --> 16:02.782
Congratulations...

16:03.916 --> 16:05.380
Red Team wins, two to one.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.749
(Wolfgang) Congratulations.

16:06.750 --> 16:07.881
Oh, yes!

16:07.882 --> 16:08.916
Good job, ladies. Good job.

16:08.917 --> 16:09.916
Whoo hoo!

16:09.917 --> 16:10.948
[Laughs]

16:10.949 --> 16:12.848
We won, and I was the leader.

16:12.849 --> 16:14.381
I'll let them give me the kudos.

16:14.382 --> 16:15.615
Oh, God.

16:15.616 --> 16:17.648
Carrie doesn't have
anything to celebrate.

16:17.649 --> 16:20.315
She didn't do anything to
help in this challenge.

16:20.316 --> 16:21.315
[Applause]

16:21.316 --> 16:22.582
Best wishes. Thank you so much.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.815
Thank you, chefs. Keep on working.

16:24.816 --> 16:26.948
(All) Yes, chef. Thank you.

16:26.949 --> 16:29.115
I don't hide nothin'.
I don't candy coat.

16:29.116 --> 16:30.981
Tommy was a [Bleep] leader today.

16:30.982 --> 16:32.349
That's puttin' it mildly.

16:32.350 --> 16:33.915
Ladies, you and your team

16:33.916 --> 16:35.249
ready for a special treat?

16:35.250 --> 16:36.249
Good.  yes.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.815
Thank you! A treat!

16:37.816 --> 16:38.916
A true Hollywood experience.

16:38.917 --> 16:40.081
Yay!

16:40.082 --> 16:41.349
You'll be cruising down

16:41.350 --> 16:43.381
like hot chicks down sunset strip!

16:43.382 --> 16:44.381
Yay! Yay.

16:44.382 --> 16:45.382
We can look hot.

16:45.383 --> 16:46.715
And then I've arranged

16:46.716 --> 16:49.548
for a unique, very
personal performance

16:49.549 --> 16:52.848
at the world-famous
laugh factory.

16:52.849 --> 16:54.081
Wow.

16:54.082 --> 16:55.381
It's gonna be a blast.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.915
Head up to the dorms. Good job.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.915
[Women chattering
excitedly]  good job.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.515
Oh, my God, this is so big.

17:01.516 --> 17:02.581
So awesome.

17:02.582 --> 17:04.214
I cannot wait to get out of here.

17:04.215 --> 17:05.515
Whoo hoo!

17:05.516 --> 17:06.848
While the girls are

17:06.848 --> 17:08.580
having a day of laughs

17:08.582 --> 17:09.915
and letting their hair down,

17:09.916 --> 17:13.214
you've got a long,
brutal day of cleaning.

17:13.215 --> 17:15.582
First of all, you're gonna
clean and prep both kitchens

17:15.583 --> 17:19.080
because I'm opening
Hell's Kitchen tonight.

17:19.082 --> 17:21.647
In addition,  I want
those dorms spotless.

17:21.648 --> 17:22.748
Got it?

17:22.749 --> 17:23.747
(All) Yes, chef.

17:23.748 --> 17:24.749
Now get out of here.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.147
Piss off.

17:27.148 --> 17:28.182
And, Jonathon...

17:28.183 --> 17:29.415
Yes, chef?

17:29.416 --> 17:31.081
You're disappearing.

17:31.082 --> 17:33.915
No, I'm not. I'm right here, chef.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.348
Oh, my God!

17:35.349 --> 17:36.915
We're leaving the house!

17:36.916 --> 17:39.181
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

17:39.182 --> 17:41.281
I get to be a pretty girl today.

17:41.282 --> 17:42.649
Do you think that this
dress is too much?

17:42.650 --> 17:45.281
Ohh! No, no!
Now I have to dress up!

17:45.282 --> 17:47.116
I'm gonna put my
freak 'em dress on.

17:47.117 --> 17:49.915
(Announcer) While the Red Team
gets ready for some Hollywood fun,

17:49.916 --> 17:52.415
down in the kitchen,
Jonathon is already

17:52.416 --> 17:53.981
feeling the punishment.

17:53.982 --> 17:55.449
[Groans] What's
the matter,  John?

17:55.450 --> 17:57.048
I don't know  if I got a... a...

17:57.049 --> 17:58.681
a pulled muscle or a pinched nerve

17:58.682 --> 18:00.549
in my neck, shoulder,
something, man.

18:00.550 --> 18:03.048
Jonathon, if you're
not feeling well,

18:03.049 --> 18:04.682
leave all the heavy lifting
to the rest of the guys.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.181
Yes, chef.

18:06.182 --> 18:08.080
(Paul) All of a sudden,
when we get punished,

18:08.081 --> 18:09.549
he's like, "I pulled a muscle."

18:09.550 --> 18:11.681
Come on, man, you're just
being a little bitch.

18:11.682 --> 18:15.581
Right now, I'm worried
about Jonathon.

18:15.582 --> 18:17.516
You know, I have babies to
take care of back home.

18:17.517 --> 18:19.748
[Coughs] Um.

18:19.749 --> 18:22.148
Oh, my God, those look really hot.

18:22.149 --> 18:23.748
Okay.  [Laughing]

18:23.749 --> 18:24.982
What are you, lady gaga?

18:24.983 --> 18:26.048
That's right.

18:26.049 --> 18:27.615
[Laughs]

18:27.616 --> 18:29.049
What the [Bleep] is that
girl wearing on her head?

18:29.050 --> 18:30.648
[Laughter]

18:30.649 --> 18:32.149
I like my feather.
I don't care what people think.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.648
Let's go, baby baby!

18:34.649 --> 18:38.048
[All cheering]

18:38.049 --> 18:40.148
(Elise) Sunset Boulevard.

18:40.149 --> 18:42.148
Palm trees and sun.

18:42.149 --> 18:43.582
[All cheering]

18:46.516 --> 18:47.747
Okay, guys, part of the punishment

18:47.748 --> 18:49.216
you're also gonna clean
upstairs in the dorms.

18:49.217 --> 18:51.848
Okay, Tommy, since you
were the team leader,

18:51.849 --> 18:53.616
those are for you and you
can start in the bathrooms.

18:53.617 --> 18:55.115
Fantastic.

18:55.116 --> 18:56.348
A toothbrush.

18:56.349 --> 18:58.048
Ah, it's not gonna be pretty.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.048
This really happening right now?

19:00.049 --> 19:02.248
I gotta touch these nasty
girls' nasty stuff.

19:02.249 --> 19:04.149
Dirty drink bottles.
Dirty cups, dirty stuff.

19:04.150 --> 19:05.181
Everywhere.

19:05.182 --> 19:06.481
It was disgusting.

19:06.482 --> 19:07.682
I thought I was a [Bleep] slob.

19:07.683 --> 19:09.815
Anyone know where Jonathon is?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.248
No.

19:11.249 --> 19:12.814
(Announcer) While cleaning
the dorms without Jonathon

19:12.815 --> 19:13.980
is no fun for the Blue Team...

19:13.981 --> 19:14.982
[Jonathon groans]

19:14.983 --> 19:16.581
It's all laughs on the Red Team.

19:16.582 --> 19:18.381
Come on, ladies.

19:18.382 --> 19:21.715
Yeah! Laugh factory!

19:21.716 --> 19:22.715
Heeey.

19:22.716 --> 19:24.948
Heeey. Yeah. What's going on?

19:24.949 --> 19:26.515
Did a bird hit you on the way in?

19:26.516 --> 19:28.148
What happened?

19:28.149 --> 19:30.481
[Laughter]

19:30.482 --> 19:32.881
It was great for us to
be not in the kitchen.

19:32.882 --> 19:34.581
Not doing punishment.

19:34.582 --> 19:36.115
We needed this.

19:36.116 --> 19:38.881
For my birthday, my husband gave me

19:38.882 --> 19:39.981
a scale!

19:39.982 --> 19:41.114
[Audience groans]

19:41.115 --> 19:42.480
For his birthday next year,

19:42.481 --> 19:43.849
I'm gonna give him a ruler!

19:43.850 --> 19:45.648
[Laughter]

19:45.649 --> 19:47.815
It felt really good
bonding with each other

19:47.816 --> 19:48.947
and having fun.

19:48.948 --> 19:50.480
Like, a few hours to not be nervous

19:50.481 --> 19:51.749
about dinner service.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.948
Gordon Ramsay would
have been awesome

19:53.949 --> 19:57.181
during my labor, 'cause
it was 22 hours.

19:57.182 --> 19:58.314
[Audience groans] I know!

19:58.315 --> 19:59.849
He would have gotten that baby out!

19:59.850 --> 20:01.081
[Laughter]

20:01.082 --> 20:02.216
"Get out, get out, get out!"

20:02.217 --> 20:03.348
[Laughter]

20:03.349 --> 20:05.948
I would have pushed
that, pop, right out.

20:05.949 --> 20:09.682
And then he would have
been like, "it's raw!"

20:13.882 --> 20:15.480
(Announcer) While the Red
Team can't stop laughing,

20:15.481 --> 20:16.516
back at Hell's Kitchen...

20:16.517 --> 20:18.015
[Sighs]

20:18.016 --> 20:19.516
(Announcer) There's no
joking on the Blue Team.

20:19.517 --> 20:20.915
No word on Jonathon?

20:20.916 --> 20:22.380
I don't know  what he's doing.

20:22.381 --> 20:24.649
Really getting tired of it.
"Why the [Bleep] he's not here?"

20:24.650 --> 20:26.382
He's freaking out.

20:27.416 --> 20:29.481
Hello, hello.

20:29.482 --> 20:30.716
What's up, Blue Team?

20:30.717 --> 20:32.148
Hi.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.382
How y'all doin'?

20:33.383 --> 20:34.748
How was your afternoon?

20:34.749 --> 20:36.681
It was awesome.

20:36.682 --> 20:38.115
Oh, man.

20:38.116 --> 20:39.616
(Jennifer) I'm, like,
absolutely glowing.

20:39.617 --> 20:40.981
I had such a great day.

20:40.982 --> 20:42.116
Does it look clean?

20:42.117 --> 20:43.415
What's this?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.781
[All squealing]

20:45.782 --> 20:47.115
Holy [Bleep].

20:47.116 --> 20:48.148
Wait a minute.

20:48.149 --> 20:49.149
"Congratulations to the Red Team."

20:49.150 --> 20:50.915
"Here's a set of cookware

20:50.916 --> 20:52.948
for each of you to take home!"

20:52.949 --> 20:54.581
[Cheers and applause]

20:54.582 --> 20:57.148
The Demeyre's cookware
is absolutely beautiful.

20:57.149 --> 21:01.015
That is definitely the
chocolate-covered cherry

21:01.016 --> 21:02.380
on the top of a great day.

21:02.381 --> 21:04.149
[Laughing and chattering] Red Team!

21:04.150 --> 21:06.081
[All cheer]

21:06.082 --> 21:08.781
(Announcer) With less than an hour
left to prep for dinner service...

21:08.782 --> 21:11.548
Yo, we are severely
out of [Bleep] time.

21:11.549 --> 21:14.815
(Announcer) Jonathon is
still missing in action.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.416
- Is Jonathon out?
- I guess so.

21:18.649 --> 21:22.481
I'm really starting to doubt
Jonathon's character right now.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.916
I'll tell you, dude, he's
starting to piss me off.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.615
Big Mr. "I'm never gonna quit
and I'm always gonna fight"

21:27.616 --> 21:29.247
has a crick in his neck,
and now all of a sudden

21:29.248 --> 21:30.482
he's need doing anything.

21:30.483 --> 21:31.780
[Groans softly]

21:31.781 --> 21:33.616
You wanna sit on the sidelines
because you got a crick?

21:33.617 --> 21:35.281
That's absolutely ridiculous.

21:35.282 --> 21:37.249
Now what the [Bleep]
is wrong with him?

21:37.250 --> 21:39.648
Well, it looks like we
got four people today.

21:39.649 --> 21:41.447
Honestly, if Jonathon
doesn't show up

21:41.448 --> 21:42.714
to dinner service tonight,

21:42.715 --> 21:44.214
I don't want him on
my team anymore.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.847
[Bleep], you know, let's
show 'em we can do it

21:45.848 --> 21:47.049
with [Bleep] four.

21:47.050 --> 21:48.649
[Snoring]

21:56.806 --> 21:58.739
(Announcer) After claiming
he had a neck injury...

21:58.740 --> 22:00.572
[Snoring]

22:00.573 --> 22:03.572
(Announcer) Jonathon sat out his
team's punishment and prep work.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.572
Ohh, [Bleep].

22:05.573 --> 22:06.326
(Announcer) But now,

22:06.327 --> 22:08.172
with less than an hour
until dinner service...

22:08.173 --> 22:09.639
He has returned to the kitchen.

22:11.773 --> 22:13.537
What are we looking
like as far as prep?

22:13.538 --> 22:14.806
We're done. We're really done.

22:14.807 --> 22:17.038
You finally come in
and expect somebody

22:17.039 --> 22:18.337
to coddle you and hold your hand.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.473
We're just getting
into this kitchen

22:19.474 --> 22:21.605
maybe like in the past ten minutes.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.272
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

22:23.273 --> 22:24.539
Just doesn't work that way, man.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.572
Paul, what are you doing
with those tomatoes?

22:26.573 --> 22:28.738
I'm sure some of my team is pissed,

22:28.739 --> 22:30.638
but hurtin' pretty good right now

22:30.639 --> 22:31.671
if you wanna know the truth.

22:31.672 --> 22:32.837
I gotta do something, man.

22:32.838 --> 22:34.071
I can't leave y'all hangin'.

22:34.072 --> 22:35.173
But, uh, hell no,
I'm not gonna quit.

22:35.174 --> 22:37.005
I'm gonna hit dinner service, man,

22:37.006 --> 22:38.406
and just do what I do.

22:40.106 --> 22:42.672
(Announcer) Meanwhile, the Red Team
hurries to finish off the prep

22:42.673 --> 22:44.404
that the Blue Team had
started for them.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.139
- I need somebody to score these.
- I'll do it.

22:46.140 --> 22:47.172
Thank you.

22:47.173 --> 22:48.538
Tonight, no mistakes.

22:48.539 --> 22:51.072
We need to be on one page
before dinner service.

22:51.073 --> 22:52.606
We gotta get this
[Bleep] together, man.

22:52.607 --> 22:54.705
Let's go, ladies.
Let's go, guys, yeah?

22:54.706 --> 22:55.871
- Yes, chef.
- Quickly.

22:55.872 --> 22:57.037
- James.
- Yes, chef?

22:57.038 --> 22:58.273
Let's go.
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.

22:58.274 --> 22:59.573
Quickly.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:10.839 --> 23:13.338
(Announcer) As the doors opened for dinner
at Hell's Kitchen...

23:13.339 --> 23:15.073
Welcome, and have a lovely evening.

23:15.074 --> 23:17.672
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay's special
guests for the night arrive.

23:17.673 --> 23:19.405
- Chef...
- Yeah?

23:19.406 --> 23:22.438
Table 21 and 31 are
the coast guards.

23:22.439 --> 23:24.905
Thank you. Table 31... look at me!

23:24.906 --> 23:26.604
Your appetizers now.
U.S. Coast Guard.

23:26.605 --> 23:27.939
Yeah? Show them some respect.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.005
Yes, chef!

23:29.006 --> 23:30.072
Let's go.

23:30.073 --> 23:31.204
Jennifer, a minute out.

23:31.205 --> 23:32.204
Yeah, a minute out.

23:32.205 --> 23:33.473
Walking in 30 seconds.

23:33.474 --> 23:35.172
Good, wow. Drive, it Jamie!

23:35.173 --> 23:36.338
Yes, chef!

23:36.339 --> 23:37.706
We have really solid
cooks on our team.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.238
How long  on the pizza, Carrie?

23:39.239 --> 23:40.773
How long does it take?
About two minutes?

23:40.774 --> 23:43.472
Um, with the exception of Carrie.

23:43.473 --> 23:45.205
What is it with you and pizza?

23:45.206 --> 23:46.639
Nothing, chef. I can do this, chef.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.272
There's a pizza on the next table.

23:48.273 --> 23:49.506
- Yes, chef.
- And it's not even rolled out.

23:49.507 --> 23:51.206
I'm rolling it right now, chef.

23:52.206 --> 23:54.538
Carrie is just so, like,

23:54.539 --> 23:55.804
frazzled in her head

23:55.805 --> 23:57.371
that she's not even
thinking straight

23:57.372 --> 23:58.837
and can't see in front of her.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.739
Look at me. That's already [Bleep].

24:00.740 --> 24:03.738
When you rolled it looking like
a pair of [Bleep] knickers.

24:03.739 --> 24:04.739
I'll start a new one, chef.

24:04.740 --> 24:06.238
[Bleep bleep]

24:06.239 --> 24:08.037
(Announcer) As Carrie
tries to avoid

24:08.038 --> 24:10.006
an early sinking of
the red kitchen,

24:10.007 --> 24:12.938
chef Ramsay wants to make
sure a demoralized Blue Team

24:12.939 --> 24:13.971
is still afloat.

24:13.972 --> 24:14.973
- All of you!
- Yes, chef!

24:14.974 --> 24:16.772
Table 22 is the U.S. Coast Guard.

24:16.773 --> 24:18.073
Don't [Bleep] this table!

24:18.074 --> 24:19.438
(All) Yes, chef!

24:19.439 --> 24:21.438
Yeah.

24:21.439 --> 24:22.738
- Jonathon.
- Yes, chef?

24:22.739 --> 24:23.739
Wake up! Let's go, yes?

24:23.740 --> 24:25.039
- I'm up, chef.
- Lift it.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.872
I feel like [Bleep] right now.

24:26.873 --> 24:28.805
I'm running at about 50%.

24:28.806 --> 24:30.805
But I sure as hell
wasn't gonna stand there

24:30.806 --> 24:34.705
look like a bitch in
front of chef Ramsay.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.772
Who put all that [Bleep]
pasta in there?

24:36.773 --> 24:39.037
- I did, I put four orders in.
- Come here.  come here.

24:39.038 --> 24:40.071
Come here, come here.
Come here.

24:40.072 --> 24:41.639
You know that is not all gonna cook

24:41.640 --> 24:43.038
like that evenly.

24:43.039 --> 24:45.237
Hey, are you watching, or
you're not part of this?

24:45.238 --> 24:45.618
Yes, chef.

24:45.619 --> 24:47.139
You're ruining, the
[Bleep] appetizers.

24:47.140 --> 24:49.772
You'll never, ever, ever

24:49.773 --> 24:50.973
cook all that in one basket.

24:50.974 --> 24:52.338
Spread it into three.

24:52.339 --> 24:54.472
Let me tell you how
frustrating it is

24:54.473 --> 24:56.105
to have someone next to you

24:56.106 --> 24:57.938
that's supposed to be your partner

24:57.939 --> 24:59.972
that's not contributing anything.

24:59.973 --> 25:01.772
- Come on!
- Yes, chef.

25:01.773 --> 25:04.672
(Announcer) While Jonathon
works on portion control

25:04.673 --> 25:06.105
in the blue kitchen,

25:06.106 --> 25:08.638
the Red Team is hoping
to get just one portion

25:08.639 --> 25:10.405
out of Carrie.

25:10.406 --> 25:11.804
- Risotto, how long?
- It's burnt.

25:11.805 --> 25:13.339
My garlic burnt, chef,
and I had to start over.

25:13.340 --> 25:14.872
Come on, Carrie!

25:14.873 --> 25:16.438
How many times

25:16.439 --> 25:17.806
have you been on the
appetizers now?

25:17.807 --> 25:19.872
It's the same result
here  from weeks ago!

25:19.873 --> 25:21.737
(Carrie) - Yes, chef.
- Nothing coming out.

25:21.738 --> 25:22.739
All because of Carrie.

25:22.740 --> 25:24.272
Nothing coming out again.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.938
Yes, chef.

25:25.939 --> 25:27.772
- Jamie, listen, yes?
- Yes, chef.

25:27.773 --> 25:28.772
Let's go, you.

25:28.773 --> 25:29.804
(Jamie) Carrie was struggling.

25:29.805 --> 25:31.273
So I tried to help where I could,

25:31.274 --> 25:32.938
when I could.

25:32.939 --> 25:34.739
Should I do more than
that, or is that enough?

25:34.740 --> 25:35.905
That's good.

25:35.906 --> 25:37.104
Sometimes, that's
what you have to do

25:37.105 --> 25:38.639
with the weakest people
is go help them out.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.938
Apps. Carrie?

25:39.939 --> 25:40.937
I'm ready right now, guys.

25:40.938 --> 25:41.937
All right, go ahead.

25:41.938 --> 25:43.271
I'm walking with risotto.

25:43.272 --> 25:44.339
You guys are walking?

25:44.340 --> 25:45.605
I'm walking!

25:45.606 --> 25:46.673
(Announcer) Thanks to Jamie's help,

25:46.674 --> 25:48.605
the Red Team rallies. Let's go!

25:48.606 --> 25:50.571
(Announcer) Out to the dining room.

25:50.572 --> 25:51.806
Thank you, sir.

25:51.807 --> 25:52.838
Mmm.

25:52.839 --> 25:54.338
That's really good.

25:54.339 --> 25:56.473
(Announcer) While the V.I.P.
diners on the blue side

25:56.474 --> 25:58.072
can only watch and wait.

25:58.073 --> 26:00.073
Didn't we order right before them?

26:03.339 --> 26:05.305
Two cappellini, one mussels!

26:05.306 --> 26:06.404
I hope it's coming!

26:06.405 --> 26:07.604
Please take that up.
I'm taking it up.

26:07.605 --> 26:08.706
I gotta get it mixed

26:08.707 --> 26:11.672
or gonna get our [Bleep]
chewed out again.

26:11.673 --> 26:13.539
Coming up with mussels
right behind you.

26:15.139 --> 26:17.505
They're very, very bland.

26:17.506 --> 26:18.506
[Bleep].

26:21.039 --> 26:22.473
Cappellini, overcooked.

26:24.406 --> 26:26.306
And not an ounce of
salt in the mussels.

26:26.307 --> 26:27.804
It's the U.S. Coast Guard.

26:27.805 --> 26:28.804
- Yes, chef.
- Yeah?

26:28.805 --> 26:30.273
They save lives for a living.

26:30.274 --> 26:31.405
At least

26:31.406 --> 26:33.138
we can make  their night exciting

26:33.139 --> 26:34.873
by giving them some delicious food!

26:34.874 --> 26:36.205
- Yes, chef.
- Start again!

26:36.206 --> 26:37.372
Hurry up!

26:37.373 --> 26:38.371
Do you have pasta in?

26:38.372 --> 26:39.373
Yeah, man, I'm ready.

26:39.374 --> 26:40.905
How long for the cappellini?

26:40.906 --> 26:43.072
You don't have pasta in!

26:43.073 --> 26:44.072
Damn, man.

26:44.073 --> 26:45.705
Jonathon and Natalie,

26:45.706 --> 26:47.805
engage in each other!

26:47.806 --> 26:49.638
- Who's taking control?!
- I am, chef!

26:49.639 --> 26:52.205
- Then [Bleep] do it!
- Yes, chef!

26:52.206 --> 26:53.206
I'll do the mussel,

26:53.207 --> 26:54.706
you start the cappellini.

26:54.707 --> 26:56.972
Between Natalie and
Jonathon on appetizers,

26:56.973 --> 26:58.772
man, it was like the fish market,

26:58.773 --> 27:01.005
all that floundering going on.

27:01.006 --> 27:02.039
That cappellini ready?

27:02.040 --> 27:03.872
- Right now.
- Taking it up.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.372
Behind you in 30 seconds!

27:06.373 --> 27:08.138
Cappellini, chef.

27:08.139 --> 27:09.906
[Bleep] Me.

27:11.273 --> 27:13.738
Over my [Bleep] dead body.

27:13.739 --> 27:15.905
All of you, come here.

27:15.906 --> 27:16.906
What is this food?

27:16.907 --> 27:18.805
Just taste that. Taste it!

27:18.806 --> 27:20.939
I swear to God, it's like
food from a kindergarten.

27:20.940 --> 27:24.272
I've tasted better
canned spaghetti!

27:24.273 --> 27:27.105
And this is the U.S. Coast Guard!

27:27.106 --> 27:28.472
- You!
- Yes, chef?

27:28.473 --> 27:30.206
Show him how to do a
lobster cappellini!

27:30.207 --> 27:32.338
- Yes, chef!
- If it doesn't sink in,

27:32.339 --> 27:33.405
they're out!

27:33.406 --> 27:34.671
I don't care! They're gone!

27:34.672 --> 27:35.706
Natalie, start the
sauces  again, please.

27:35.707 --> 27:37.105
Yes, chef.

27:37.106 --> 27:38.371
There was no communication

27:38.372 --> 27:39.806
between Natalie and
Jonathon tonight.

27:39.807 --> 27:42.304
They literally had their backs
to each other all night.

27:42.305 --> 27:43.606
Pull that pasta out. It's done.

27:43.607 --> 27:44.772
Slide this.

27:44.773 --> 27:45.939
Put this together.

27:45.940 --> 27:47.638
(Gordon) Jonathon, come here.

27:47.639 --> 27:49.938
I want a word with you.

27:49.939 --> 27:51.604
(Jonathon) The pain's
starting to get to me.

27:51.605 --> 27:53.739
I thought I could push
through dinner service, man,

27:53.740 --> 27:56.505
but it's... it's gradually
getting worse.

27:56.506 --> 27:57.871
- What's happening?
- Honestly, chef...

27:57.872 --> 28:00.137
What's happening?
Look at me straight in the eyes!

28:00.138 --> 28:01.139
What's happening?
Come on.

28:01.140 --> 28:02.605
Um... give it to me!

28:02.606 --> 28:04.004
My mobility's a little limited.

28:04.005 --> 28:05.339
I didn't want to
give up on the team

28:05.340 --> 28:07.005
or be a bitch or give up,

28:07.006 --> 28:08.837
so I'm in here doing
the best I can.

28:08.838 --> 28:10.206
It doesn't stop you
using your brain!

28:10.207 --> 28:13.005
I had a young man in
here two years ago

28:13.006 --> 28:14.406
that broke his [Bleep] arm!

28:14.407 --> 28:16.538
He went on to win the
[Bleep] competition!

28:16.539 --> 28:18.339
- Yes, chef.
- If you've given up, get out!

28:26.842 --> 28:28.042
(Announcer) An hour
into dinner service...

28:28.043 --> 28:30.874
Over my [Bleep] dead body.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.641
(Announcer) Jonathon is failing
miserably on appetizers.

28:33.642 --> 28:36.041
I've tasted better
canned spaghetti!

28:36.042 --> 28:37.342
Jonathon, come here.
I want a word with you.

28:37.343 --> 28:40.674
(Announcer) And chef
Ramsay wants to know why.

28:40.675 --> 28:41.673
Look at me straight in the eyes!

28:41.674 --> 28:42.673
What's happening? Come on.

28:42.674 --> 28:43.675
Um... give it to me.

28:43.676 --> 28:45.874
My mobility's a little limited.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.242
I didn't want to
give up on the team.

28:47.243 --> 28:49.708
It doesn't stop you
using your brain!

28:49.709 --> 28:51.340
I had a young man in
here two years ago

28:51.341 --> 28:52.807
that broke his [Bleep] arm!

28:52.808 --> 28:54.740
He went on to win the
[Bleep] competition!

28:54.741 --> 28:56.309
- Yes, chef.
- If you've given up, get out!

28:56.310 --> 28:58.674
- I'm not giving up.
- Well, [Bleep] fight back!

28:58.675 --> 28:59.673
I am fighting, chef.

28:59.674 --> 29:00.975
Then stop sending me [Bleep]!

29:00.976 --> 29:02.409
Yes, chef.

29:03.775 --> 29:06.441
You know, obviously he
sees something in me.

29:06.442 --> 29:07.774
He knows I'm a fighter.

29:07.775 --> 29:09.941
So I'm gonna step it
up a couple notches.

29:09.942 --> 29:11.840
(Paul)  another cappellini's
the next ticket.

29:11.841 --> 29:13.073
All right, Jonathon?

29:13.074 --> 29:14.342
Yep, I'm putting it
together right now.

29:14.343 --> 29:15.708
Okay.

29:15.709 --> 29:17.040
(Announcer) Jonathon has
begun to rally back,

29:17.041 --> 29:18.275
fighting through the pain.

29:18.276 --> 29:20.374
All right, cappellini
salad for the scallops.

29:20.375 --> 29:21.841
Right now.

29:21.842 --> 29:23.308
It's nicely cooked.

29:23.309 --> 29:25.309
(Announcer) And the Blue
Team is back in the groove,

29:25.310 --> 29:28.442
finally cooking appetizers worthy of the
U.S. Coast Guard.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.841
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen...

29:31.842 --> 29:33.508
- How long?
- Three minutes, chef.

29:33.509 --> 29:35.074
- Let's go.
- Three minutes.

29:35.075 --> 29:36.907
(Announcer) The ladies are
trying to keep it together.

29:36.908 --> 29:38.173
An order for table 31.

29:38.174 --> 29:39.607
Two Wellingtons, two
New York strips.

29:39.608 --> 29:40.607
(All) Yes, chef!

29:40.608 --> 29:41.873
All meat so far.

29:41.874 --> 29:43.709
- Yes, chef!
- Let's go. Keep it going.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.709
Okay, so everybody notice
on the first ticket,

29:45.710 --> 29:47.774
we have two new Yorks and
two Wellingtons, right?

29:47.775 --> 29:48.908
Yep, yep.

29:48.909 --> 29:49.975
It's interesting that
a group of girls

29:49.976 --> 29:51.908
that hate each other outside...

29:51.909 --> 29:52.973
Ten minutes, Elise?

29:52.974 --> 29:54.009
- Two minutes.
- All right, you got it.

29:54.010 --> 29:55.041
Thank you.

29:55.042 --> 29:56.774
Can work together in the kitchen.

29:56.775 --> 29:57.840
Keep it up, ladies!

29:57.841 --> 29:58.973
Thank you, Jamie!

29:58.974 --> 30:00.240
Everything's working in harmony.

30:00.241 --> 30:01.442
It just felt like a symphony.

30:01.443 --> 30:04.108
Hey, what do we got next?

30:04.109 --> 30:05.140
Two strip, medium well.

30:05.141 --> 30:06.175
Two Wellington.

30:06.176 --> 30:08.041
Elizabeth,  are you walking?

30:08.042 --> 30:09.642
We're walking in, like,
30 seconds, Lise.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.308
- 30 seconds?
- Thank you.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.309
- Elizabeth?
- Yeah.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.309
She's slicing.

30:13.310 --> 30:14.641
Got it.

30:14.642 --> 30:15.642
Thank you for checking.
You're welcome.

30:15.643 --> 30:16.908
I'm walking.

30:16.909 --> 30:18.007
I'm walking right now.

30:18.008 --> 30:19.809
All right, so I got
that, I got that.

30:19.810 --> 30:20.908
Ladies...

30:20.909 --> 30:22.142
Perfectly seasoned garnish,

30:22.143 --> 30:24.541
all there on time.
Keep it going, yes?

30:24.542 --> 30:26.642
(Announcer) While the Red Team
is working in perfect harmony...

30:26.643 --> 30:29.341
[Overlapping chatter]

30:29.342 --> 30:30.908
I want him to speak English!

30:30.909 --> 30:33.474
(Announcer) The Blue Team
continues to hit sour notes.

30:33.475 --> 30:35.508
I got a symphony in there,

30:35.509 --> 30:36.909
and it's just a noise in here!

30:36.910 --> 30:38.974
Yes, chef!

30:38.975 --> 30:39.791
Ooh, sorry.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.274
[Laughing] Careful.

30:41.275 --> 30:42.675
We were just all over the place.

30:42.676 --> 30:45.141
I mean, at one point, I
almost fell over Tommy

30:45.142 --> 30:46.340
opening an oven.

30:46.341 --> 30:47.442
And he starts laughing.

30:47.443 --> 30:48.841
[Laughing] Careful.

30:48.842 --> 30:50.109
- Tommy, come here.
- Yes, chef?

30:50.110 --> 30:51.508
Come here.

30:51.509 --> 30:53.208
Yeah, hurry up!

30:53.209 --> 30:54.542
- Yes, chef?
- Stop [Bleep] laughing.

30:54.543 --> 30:56.741
- 'Cause it's not funny.
- Okay, chef.

30:56.742 --> 30:58.040
- It's not funny, okay?
- Yes, chef.

30:58.041 --> 30:59.742
[Bleep] Hell, what do
you want, an accident?

30:59.743 --> 31:01.174
- Hell, no.
- Go in slowly.

31:01.175 --> 31:02.209
Then it comes back out.

31:02.210 --> 31:04.241
Take the [Bleep] out of there.

31:04.242 --> 31:05.340
Work on this one, yes? All right.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.973
What if I had fallen with a hot pan

31:06.974 --> 31:08.442
and, like, fried my face off.

31:08.443 --> 31:09.774
Like, that's not funny.

31:09.775 --> 31:11.441
- Wanna laugh?
- No.

31:11.442 --> 31:12.442
No? Well, let's go then.

31:12.443 --> 31:13.608
Yes, chef.

31:13.609 --> 31:14.642
(Announcer) As Tommy struggles

31:14.643 --> 31:16.341
to keep his head above water,

31:16.342 --> 31:19.441
the red kitchen is being
flooded with meat orders.

31:19.442 --> 31:20.607
Entrees, incredible
two New York strip,

31:20.608 --> 31:21.773
one Wellington, one meatball.

31:21.774 --> 31:23.073
- All meat again!
- Yes, chef!

31:23.074 --> 31:24.107
I got it, I got it.

31:24.108 --> 31:25.273
This is insane.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.040
I've never seen the
meat station this busy.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.440
Again, all meat.
Two New York strip.

31:28.441 --> 31:29.507
One Wellington.

31:29.508 --> 31:30.842
You've got nothing to do.

31:30.843 --> 31:32.574
I'll help. I'll help her.

31:32.575 --> 31:34.741
I was on the fish station.
Truthfully, I...

31:34.742 --> 31:36.709
[Laughs] I got the easy
end of the deal tonight.

31:36.710 --> 31:39.608
Nine entrees. Eight meat, one fish.

31:39.609 --> 31:40.842
Wellington, Wellington, Wellington.

31:40.843 --> 31:42.341
Strip, strip, meatball.

31:42.342 --> 31:43.641
It was like, oh, my God.

31:43.642 --> 31:45.908
- How long, Elise?
- Two minutes!

31:45.909 --> 31:47.040
I'm thinking to myself,

31:47.041 --> 31:48.809
is this gonna be the
night that I go down?

31:48.810 --> 31:51.674
Because I had so much stuff,
I can't even count.

31:51.675 --> 31:53.674
- Wellington.
- I'm walking.

31:53.675 --> 31:55.407
Right now, two New York
strip, one Wellington.

31:55.408 --> 31:56.661
Keep it going. Don't stop!

31:56.662 --> 31:57.240
Yes, chef!

31:57.241 --> 31:59.107
I was waiting for garnish,
chef, I'm sorry.

31:59.108 --> 32:00.340
- I'm sorry, chef.
- Let's go!

32:00.341 --> 32:01.342
- Don't stop!
- Sorry, chef.

32:01.343 --> 32:03.309
[Bangs counter] Yes, chef!

32:05.175 --> 32:06.175
Elise.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.373
- Perfectly cooked, the Wellington.
- Thank you, chef.

32:10.374 --> 32:11.940
Lise, do you want me to
come over and help you?

32:11.941 --> 32:13.373
Nope, I got it. Thank you.

32:13.374 --> 32:15.309
Wellingtons she's
nailed every time.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.374
[Belches] 'Scuse me.

32:17.375 --> 32:18.874
Girl...

32:18.875 --> 32:20.441
(Announcer) While Elise's entrees

32:20.442 --> 32:22.242
continue to be a hit
in the dining room...

32:22.243 --> 32:24.041
- Wonderful.
- Ohh.

32:24.042 --> 32:26.974
The Blue Team is still
stuck on appetizers.

32:26.975 --> 32:29.274
Can you fire another
scallop for me, please?

32:29.275 --> 32:30.940
(Announcer) And falling
further behind.

32:30.941 --> 32:32.007
(Gordon)  hey, Blue Team!

32:32.008 --> 32:33.207
Blue Team! Yes, chef?

32:33.208 --> 32:34.373
Put your pans down. Come here.

32:34.374 --> 32:35.475
All of you, come here!

32:35.476 --> 32:37.441
That's it. Move, Natalie!

32:37.442 --> 32:41.442
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11 tickets.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.675
Come here. Come here.

32:42.676 --> 32:44.108
Come here.

32:44.109 --> 32:45.874
Just look in there. Look!

32:45.875 --> 32:47.109
And listen to them!

32:47.110 --> 32:48.241
How long?

32:48.242 --> 32:49.908
Four minutes! Four minutes.

32:49.909 --> 32:52.074
- Look at the [Bleep] difference!
- Yes, chef.

32:52.075 --> 32:53.740
Let's blow 'em out of the
water right now, boys,

32:53.741 --> 32:55.509
and don't stop, go,
guys, [Bleep] Go!

32:55.510 --> 32:57.841
Watch the pizza in the
oven it doesn't burn!

32:57.842 --> 32:59.307
You know, it was
friggin' embarrassing.

32:59.308 --> 33:01.542
Because I know every, single
person in the blue kitchen

33:01.543 --> 33:05.341
is a better cook than
anybody in the red kitchen.

33:05.342 --> 33:07.708
New York strip, Wellington.
Where are we?

33:07.709 --> 33:09.708
- How long, Tommy?
- Anybody helping him or what?

33:09.709 --> 33:11.574
I got it, I got it, I got it.

33:11.575 --> 33:13.308
You gotta cut those too, man.

33:13.309 --> 33:15.208
Oh, [Bleep] Me.

33:15.209 --> 33:16.341
You three.

33:16.342 --> 33:17.674
Cut it and bring it up.

33:17.675 --> 33:18.874
Bring it up.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.375
What's this one...
normal or medium?

33:20.376 --> 33:22.208
Chef? Is that medium?

33:22.209 --> 33:23.608
Four minutes! Thank you!

33:23.609 --> 33:24.842
Medium or what?

33:24.843 --> 33:27.141
Tommy can cook, but Tommy
doesn't communicate.

33:27.142 --> 33:28.941
Tommy's in his own [Bleep] world.

33:28.942 --> 33:30.274
Tommy, what's this one?

33:30.275 --> 33:32.274
You had two temps. You had a...

33:32.275 --> 33:33.741
where is the two medium?

33:33.742 --> 33:35.040
Stop, leave me alone.
Leave me alone, Tommy.

33:35.041 --> 33:36.773
That's the medium rare.
My head hurts.

33:36.774 --> 33:38.175
The last two are the two mediums.

33:40.109 --> 33:41.841
All of you.

33:41.842 --> 33:43.374
All of you, just touch that.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.974
Just touch that.

33:45.975 --> 33:46.975
Where's the two medium?

33:46.976 --> 33:48.274
Here, chef.

33:48.275 --> 33:49.909
- And that is the medium rare.
- Oh, the cold one?

33:52.275 --> 33:55.408
You made me look a [Bleep] in
front of Wolfgang Puck today.

33:55.409 --> 33:57.708
Now that's... that's hot,

33:57.709 --> 33:59.408
that's lukewarm, and that's cold.

33:59.409 --> 34:00.941
Are you done?
No, no, no.

34:00.942 --> 34:02.875
I'm done with... yeah,
I'm done with you.

34:11.206 --> 34:13.206
(Announcer) Two hours into a disastrous
dinner service,

34:13.206 --> 34:14.438
for the Blue Team...

34:14.440 --> 34:15.873
All of you... that's hot,
that's lukewarm,

34:15.875 --> 34:17.473
and that's cold.

34:17.474 --> 34:20.639
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has an
important question for Tommy.

34:20.641 --> 34:21.938
Are you done?
No, no, no.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.405
I'm done with... yeah,
I'm done with you.

34:23.406 --> 34:25.741
Tommy, heat 'em up, get 'em
back to the [Bleep] pass.

34:25.742 --> 34:26.741
How long?

34:26.742 --> 34:28.040
How long?!

34:28.041 --> 34:30.239
Three minutes, chef.

34:30.241 --> 34:31.239
You have another
Wellington you can use,

34:31.239 --> 34:32.607
or do I need to put this one in?

34:32.608 --> 34:34.806
Why can't we just
[Bleep] reheat it?

34:34.806 --> 34:35.806
No!

34:35.806 --> 34:37.206
It's falling apart!

34:37.206 --> 34:38.407
It looks like [Bleep]!

34:38.408 --> 34:41.306
I'm not sending it out like that!

34:41.306 --> 34:43.474
(Announcer) Meanwhile, the Red
Team is close to finishing

34:43.475 --> 34:45.139
their best service yet.

34:45.141 --> 34:46.205
Last table, come on.

34:46.206 --> 34:47.674
- Yes, chef.
- Last table, drive it!

34:47.675 --> 34:49.040
Got it.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.406
I think we won tonight.

34:50.407 --> 34:52.072
[Bleep], I hate it
when people say that.

34:52.072 --> 34:53.572
It jinxes us.
I think we did, though.

34:53.572 --> 34:54.641
Good, but don't jinx it.

34:54.641 --> 34:58.640
I am so impressed with my team.

34:58.641 --> 35:00.040
Mmm, wow. That's good.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.973
And the way that they allowed me

35:02.974 --> 35:04.640
to lead us to victory tonight.

35:04.641 --> 35:06.406
Psst! I think we won.

35:06.407 --> 35:08.507
(Announcer) While Elise is ready
to give her victory speech,

35:08.508 --> 35:11.340
the Blue Team just tries
to stay in the game.

35:11.341 --> 35:12.705
Remember, it ain't
how you [Bleep] start.

35:12.706 --> 35:14.274
It's how you [Bleep] finish.
Let's go!

35:14.275 --> 35:15.940
Holy [Bleep], my head hurts.

35:15.941 --> 35:17.740
I need one minute on my pizza.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.973
We had our [Bleep] bashed and
our asses handed to us tonight.

35:20.974 --> 35:22.674
But everybody just stuck in
there and didn't give up.

35:22.675 --> 35:24.073
Pick up, please.

35:24.074 --> 35:26.005
This is your last ticket.
Come on, guys, finish strong.

35:26.006 --> 35:27.341
(Jonathon) Pizza's up, chef.

35:27.342 --> 35:28.341
Ah, bravo.

35:28.342 --> 35:30.040
Finally got here.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.573
(Woman)  that does really good.

35:31.574 --> 35:32.707
Very good. Worth the wait.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.507
Oh, what a [Bleep] night.

35:40.007 --> 35:41.540
What I'm looking for

35:41.541 --> 35:43.673
and begging for are smooth services

35:43.674 --> 35:45.974
where each kitchen
is raising the bar.

35:48.041 --> 35:50.606
And I got it.
Congratulations Red Team!

35:50.607 --> 35:51.606
[Applause]

35:51.607 --> 35:53.506
Finally!

35:53.507 --> 35:54.741
Good job, ladies.

35:54.742 --> 35:57.573
The one person
that did impress me.

35:57.574 --> 35:58.573
Elise.

35:58.574 --> 36:00.606
Great job.

36:00.607 --> 36:02.640
Thank you.

36:02.641 --> 36:03.840
Blue Team...

36:03.841 --> 36:04.874
You're moving backwards.

36:06.574 --> 36:08.406
Get back up to the dorm

36:08.407 --> 36:10.373
and come up  with two individuals

36:10.374 --> 36:13.874
that you think should be
leaving Hell's Kitchen.

36:15.941 --> 36:16.941
Get out of here!

36:20.907 --> 36:22.805
We're eight [Bleep]
dinner services in.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.774
We still haven't had a
[Bleep] good service.

36:24.775 --> 36:27.506
In my opinion, it's gonna
be Jonathon going up.

36:27.507 --> 36:29.241
He could have done
something during prep

36:29.242 --> 36:31.273
and during the punishment
to help the team,

36:31.274 --> 36:32.741
instead of sitting there.

36:34.274 --> 36:36.040
All right, who's got what to say?

36:36.041 --> 36:37.606
(Tommy)  I'll go first.

36:37.607 --> 36:38.772
Natalie and Jon,
'cause we got held up

36:38.773 --> 36:39.939
on apps a long time.

36:39.940 --> 36:40.941
I don't agree with that.

36:40.942 --> 36:42.306
At all.

36:42.307 --> 36:44.506
The appetizers being
held up and send back

36:44.507 --> 36:45.607
were not my fault.

36:45.608 --> 36:47.006
Jonathon did nothing.

36:47.007 --> 36:48.340
He did not have my back.

36:48.341 --> 36:49.807
He did not know what was going on.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.240
And he made me look like an idiot.

36:52.241 --> 36:55.140
The cappellini's the only thing
that held up the appetizers,

36:55.141 --> 36:56.805
and it's the only thing
I asked Jonathon to do

36:56.806 --> 36:58.739
was cook cappellini
and make salads.

36:58.740 --> 36:59.839
Natalie was actually
cooking the cappellini,

36:59.840 --> 37:01.007
and I stepped in to help.

37:01.008 --> 37:03.506
I feel like  I'm getting blamed

37:03.507 --> 37:04.772
for her [Bleep] up

37:04.773 --> 37:05.972
because I was on apps,

37:05.973 --> 37:07.405
and that's not fair to me, man.

37:07.406 --> 37:08.405
[Bleep] Natalie.

37:08.406 --> 37:10.105
She tries to use everything she can

37:10.106 --> 37:11.207
to take the heat off herself

37:11.208 --> 37:12.707
and put it on somebody else.

37:12.708 --> 37:15.240
You know, maybe I ought to stop
being the [Bleep] nice guy

37:15.241 --> 37:16.874
and get selfish like
everybody else.

37:16.875 --> 37:18.440
Jonathon, who are your votes for?

37:18.441 --> 37:19.641
Tommy and Natalie.

37:23.341 --> 37:24.441
It wasn't just that, though.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.540
It was that  communication
thing again.

37:26.541 --> 37:27.874
And it [Bleep] everything up.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.240
I get what you're
saying, Jon, I do.

37:30.241 --> 37:31.805
Because, like,  he
doesn't communicate.

37:31.806 --> 37:33.505
You know?  he doesn't communicate.

37:33.506 --> 37:35.272
I just don't like anyone
running in my station

37:35.273 --> 37:36.305
and shuffling it around.

37:36.306 --> 37:37.507
Then, Tommy, you gotta
voice up and say,

37:37.508 --> 37:39.573
"Hey, get the [Bleep] out.
That's my meat."

37:39.574 --> 37:41.606
- You need to own that.
- You need to get a [Bleep].

37:41.607 --> 37:43.373
I don't know what's going on.

37:43.374 --> 37:44.907
I thought I was going
fine all night.

37:44.908 --> 37:47.374
But now, I don't feel
completely safe.

37:59.574 --> 38:01.173
Blue Team,

38:01.174 --> 38:02.640
you reached a consensus?

38:02.641 --> 38:05.506
(All) Yes, chef.

38:05.507 --> 38:07.140
Paul...

38:07.141 --> 38:08.141
First nominee and why.

38:08.142 --> 38:10.940
Uh, first nominee, chef...

38:10.941 --> 38:12.606
Is Jonathon.

38:12.607 --> 38:14.606
He had a slow start.

38:14.607 --> 38:15.807
And second nominee and why.

38:18.974 --> 38:20.207
Second nominee...

38:31.137 --> 38:33.836
(Announcer) After a
horrific dinner service...

38:33.837 --> 38:36.669
The Blue Team was forced to
nominate two of their own

38:36.670 --> 38:37.802
for elimination,

38:37.803 --> 38:39.670
and so far have nominated Jonathon.

38:39.671 --> 38:41.836
Second nominee and why.

38:41.837 --> 38:43.437
Second nominee...

38:45.270 --> 38:47.237
Natalie, chef.

38:48.370 --> 38:49.469
Why?

38:49.470 --> 38:50.969
We feel that appetizers was

38:50.970 --> 38:52.804
the reason why  we
had a slow start.

38:52.805 --> 38:55.603
So our vote tonight is
for appetizers, chef.

38:55.604 --> 38:56.703
Okay.

38:56.704 --> 38:57.703
Natalie...

38:57.704 --> 38:59.236
Jonathon...

38:59.237 --> 39:00.404
Step forward, please.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.036
Yeah, Paul's right.

39:09.037 --> 39:10.104
We got backed up.

39:10.105 --> 39:11.403
Big time.

39:11.404 --> 39:13.069
Jonathon, tell me why

39:13.070 --> 39:14.102
you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen.

39:14.103 --> 39:15.368
First and foremost, chef,

39:15.369 --> 39:16.804
you know, I'm not a quitter.

39:16.805 --> 39:19.736
I don't even know  the
definition of "give up."

39:19.737 --> 39:22.269
Tonight,  I wasn't 100%, um,

39:22.270 --> 39:24.503
but I still, you know,
just, uh, sucked it up

39:24.504 --> 39:26.270
and stepped in and
did the best I could

39:26.271 --> 39:27.936
to support my team.

39:27.937 --> 39:30.103
You know, I...

39:30.104 --> 39:32.402
I've made a few minor mistakes
since I've been here,

39:32.403 --> 39:34.804
but I've definitely learned
from those mistakes immediately

39:34.805 --> 39:36.003
and adjusted.

39:36.004 --> 39:37.235
Truthfully: Are you over your head?

39:37.236 --> 39:38.370
No, chef, I'm not.

39:38.371 --> 39:39.870
I'm not gonna take one step back.

39:39.871 --> 39:41.503
I'm gonna take two steps forward.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.635
I'm a fighter, and
I'll stick it out

39:42.636 --> 39:43.804
till the bitter end.

39:45.404 --> 39:47.136
Natalie...

39:47.137 --> 39:49.203
You've shown over the
last three services

39:49.204 --> 39:51.869
one mistake, you crumble.

39:51.870 --> 39:53.670
I just got really frustrated
because I felt like

39:53.671 --> 39:55.369
I needed to baby-sit.

39:55.370 --> 39:57.003
No, that's bull [Bleep]. You know.

39:57.004 --> 39:59.503
He said he came  to
service at 50% tonight,

39:59.504 --> 40:00.770
and that's what I felt.

40:00.771 --> 40:02.869
I was frustrated, and
I felt like I didn't

40:02.870 --> 40:04.102
have someone backing me up.

40:04.103 --> 40:05.335
Let me tell you something.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.068
That station could be
done with one person.

40:07.069 --> 40:08.770
I know I'm a leader  on this team.

40:08.771 --> 40:10.969
And if you need to see
more, I'll give you more.

40:10.970 --> 40:12.470
Are you proud of your
performance tonight?

40:12.471 --> 40:14.303
No. No.

40:14.304 --> 40:16.236
And the fight back was where?

40:16.237 --> 40:17.770
I felt like I tried to
pick up the pieces.

40:17.771 --> 40:18.803
I really do.

40:18.804 --> 40:20.736
[Sighs]

40:20.737 --> 40:23.637
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

40:30.537 --> 40:32.304
Natalie.

40:34.137 --> 40:36.803
Take your jacket.
Back in line.

40:36.804 --> 40:37.803
Jonathon.

40:37.804 --> 40:38.869
Whew.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.937
Game over, big boy.

40:43.404 --> 40:44.669
[Sobbing]

40:44.670 --> 40:45.902
It's been a real
honor, chef Ramsay.

40:45.903 --> 40:47.304
I appreciate it all. Thank you.

40:54.470 --> 40:56.369
This is pretty disappointing.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.004
You know, it should have
been a different call.

40:58.005 --> 41:00.502
Natalie's not gonna be able
to hide behind that [Bleep]

41:00.503 --> 41:01.735
Too much longer.

41:01.736 --> 41:02.837
You know, it's just
a matter of time,

41:02.838 --> 41:04.469
chef Ramsay's gonna see through it

41:04.470 --> 41:07.603
and, you know, she'll
be the next to go.

41:07.604 --> 41:09.536
[Sniffling] Relax, come on.

41:09.537 --> 41:11.036
Natalie...

41:11.037 --> 41:13.769
You've got one more shot.

41:13.770 --> 41:15.504
Make the most of it.

41:17.437 --> 41:18.936
Get out of here!

41:18.937 --> 41:20.469
(All) Yes, chef.

41:20.470 --> 41:22.036
Elise, great job.

41:22.037 --> 41:23.536
Thank you, chef.

41:23.537 --> 41:25.436
Okay, well, this sucks.

41:25.437 --> 41:28.803
Elise's attitude is gonna
be magnified by 500.

41:28.804 --> 41:30.436
We're [Bleep].

41:30.437 --> 41:32.135
(Natalie) It's all about
me from here on forward.

41:32.136 --> 41:34.337
I'm not gonna worry about
stepping on people's toes.

41:34.338 --> 41:36.836
Whoever needs to be here
in the end will be here,

41:36.837 --> 41:39.169
and I guarantee, I'm
gonna be one of 'em.

41:39.170 --> 41:42.069
(Elise) Nobody on my team could have
done what I did on meat tonight.

41:42.070 --> 41:43.103
Period.

41:43.104 --> 41:46.469
I am back, baby, baby!

41:46.470 --> 41:49.203
The only thing worse than
the pain in Jonathon's neck

41:49.204 --> 41:51.070
was listening to him
blame everyone else

41:51.071 --> 41:52.436
for all his mistakes.

41:52.437 --> 41:54.737
I was glad to put him
out of his misery.

42:01.370 --> 42:03.569
(Announcer) Next time
on Hell's Kitchen...

42:03.570 --> 42:04.969
I love you.

42:04.970 --> 42:06.370
(Announcer) There's romance
in the dining room.

42:06.371 --> 42:08.370
Will you be my wife for
the rest of my life?

42:08.371 --> 42:09.936
[Cheers and applause]

42:09.937 --> 42:11.335
(Announcer) But Hell's
Kitchen sweethearts...

42:11.336 --> 42:12.504
Who's cried more here, you?

42:12.505 --> 42:13.636
So what?

42:13.637 --> 42:14.837
I cry 'cause I got passion.

42:14.838 --> 42:16.069
So shut up!

42:16.070 --> 42:17.702
(Announcer) Are in
their worst fight yet.

42:17.703 --> 42:20.135
Elise is on a mission to get
Carrie kicked off this team

42:20.136 --> 42:21.335
as soon as she can.

42:21.336 --> 42:22.768
Start packing your [Bleep],

42:22.769 --> 42:24.802
'cause I'm gonna make sure
your ass is going home.

42:24.803 --> 42:26.170
(Announcer) Then,
at dinner service,

42:26.171 --> 42:28.336
Carrie challenges chef Ramsay.

42:28.337 --> 42:30.203
- Get out!
- Chef, don't kick me out.

42:30.204 --> 42:31.203
- Shut up!
- No!

42:31.204 --> 42:32.535
(Announcer) And that may get her

42:32.536 --> 42:33.537
kicked out of Hell's
Kitchen for good.

42:33.538 --> 42:35.336
Chef, please, no. I can do this!

42:35.337 --> 42:36.437
Then [Bleep] move!

42:36.438 --> 42:38.536
I am so [Bleep]
pissed off right now.

42:38.537 --> 42:40.236
(Announcer) Find out what happens.

42:40.237 --> 42:41.435
I got it, chef! I got it!

42:41.436 --> 42:42.668
(Announcer) On a confrontational...

42:42.669 --> 42:44.070
What the [Bleep] is he doing?

42:44.071 --> 42:46.303
(Announcer) Episode
of Hell's Kitchen...

42:46.304 --> 42:47.603
I want a divorce

42:47.604 --> 42:48.868
from each and every one of you.

42:48.869 --> 42:50.270
You better call security,

42:50.271 --> 42:52.436
because I will not be
walking out of here silent.

42:52.437 --> 42:55.069
(Announcer) That you definitely
don't want to miss.
