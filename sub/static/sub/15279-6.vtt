- He gave the same story.

17:43.146 --> 17:48.276
Anyway, talking to you three,
it became clear

17:48.485 --> 17:51.655
because you
had all told the same story.

17:51.822 --> 17:54.908
Which means that you had been fed
the same lie.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.494
And I never asked who fed you that lie.

Yeah. A few months later.
He kept denying it.

You were trying to protect your dad.

I had the knife on me,
but I didn't use it.

That man owed me money,
and I was drinking, and I was drunk.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.954
Did you tell the public defender?

20:46.163 --> 20:50.167
- He doesn't listen. He doesn't care.
- That's why we need you.

No. He took a couple of days off.

- For what?
- I don't know.

21:27.120 --> 21:31.958
But he didn't seem quite right,
so I thought it best to give him the time.

21:32.167 --> 21:36.462

- He mentioned Key West.

old trafficking cases-- Are you okay?

24:06.029 --> 24:07.030
Yeah.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.325
Five years ago,
a ring was busted in Dade.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.619
They rescued a group of girls who
were coming from Central America.

24:13.828 --> 24:16.622
The rings leaders, they're all in jail.

interesting in her statement right there.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.628
Her name is Cristina Colon.

24:23.587 --> 24:28.092
I tracked her down. She works up
in Homestead. Want me to run this?

No, I got it.

I don't understand what you're doing.

- He isn't a hardened thug--
- You're not a criminal defense attorney.

If you were, you'd understand that
what he's convicted of is only a fraction.

24:50.531 --> 24:54.077
- He used to do landscaping for my family.
- So you feel responsible for him.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.495
- It's personal.
- He just needs a little help.

Okay. Stop. I've seen this movie.

He has a drinking problem.
He isn't a bad guy.

I'm Detective Rayburn.

I don't remember you.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.508

Then why do you want to talk to me?

I think you might be able to help me.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.183
Okay?

26:41.934 --> 26:46.689
When you and the girls were freed,
you gave a statement to authorities.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.484
- Yes.
- There was something in that statement

26:49.692 --> 26:51.944
that I'd like to talk to you about.

26:52.570 --> 26:53.946
Okay.

26:54.155 --> 26:58.409
When you were asked about
the men who brought you to the U.S.,

26:58.617 --> 27:02.455
you'd said that
"they threatened us with fire."

27:05.082 --> 27:09.837
They threatened us with everything
they could think. Every day.

27:10.046 --> 27:12.965
And this is when you were on the boat?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.801
Yes.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.513
How did they threaten you with fire?

27:20.723 --> 27:24.685
One night, the boat stopped.

27:25.353 --> 27:28.523
I think maybe
they saw the Coast Guard.

27:28.731 --> 27:32.276
So the men shut off the engines

27:32.443 --> 27:36.239
and told us not to make any noise.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.700

27:41.035 --> 27:44.705

27:58.761 --> 28:00.888
You don't need to be sorry.

28:09.813 --> 28:14.193
So they said if...

28:14.402 --> 28:20.991
we didn't stop crying,
they would lock us inside and burn us.

28:22.493 --> 28:28.124

But after that, we knew.

28:46.976 --> 28:48.311
What did you know?

28:48.519 --> 28:52.356
That they would rather
burn us all alive than get caught.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.750
Just take a guess.

51:25.959 --> 51:28.044
Throw out a number.
Tell you what,

51:28.210 --> 51:31.297
you come within 20 bucks
and I'll buy you a drink.

51:32.298 --> 51:33.967
Uh...

51:34.592 --> 51:37.470
- Two hundred dollars?
- Ehh. One hundred fifty-nine.

51:37.679 --> 51:42.099
Close enough, you can still have your
drink. And you can do it under an hour.

51:42.308 --> 51:45.770
Who knew? What are you drinking?
Anything you want.

51:46.062 --> 51:47.522
- This is my lucky day.
- Right.

51:47.647 --> 51:49.148
- I never win anything.
- Well...

51:49.732 --> 51:51.067
Um...

51:51.275 --> 51:54.779
- Obviously, nothing imported.
- Obviously.

51:54.988 --> 52:00.284
And it also has to be a beer, in a can.
But, you know. [chuckles]

52:02.370 --> 52:05.581
Um... Can I ask you something?

52:05.790 --> 52:09.836
Are you and, um, ahem, my brother...

52:12.296 --> 52:13.506
I don't know.

52:16.634 --> 52:18.011
Okay.

52:21.931 --> 52:23.933
You know what?
I'll have what you're having.

52:24.141 --> 52:25.309
Sounds good.

53:04.057 --> 53:05.558
Back to work, huh?

53:05.767 --> 53:08.061
Oh, yeah.

53:08.269 --> 53:10.438
The guests
caught a couple of snapper.

53:10.605 --> 53:13.399
I'm going to prepare them,
then grill them up.

53:13.608 --> 53:15.568
Mom said you were
taking a few days off.

53:17.403 --> 53:21.032
I drove down to Key West for a day.
That'll do.

53:24.243 --> 53:25.327
Found your truck.

53:30.207 --> 53:31.250
It was out of gas.

53:40.426 --> 53:42.053
I know you talked to Lenny Potts.

53:45.765 --> 53:47.934
Yeah. Well, he came to me.

53:48.143 --> 53:50.394
- I spoke to him.
- Mm-hm.

53:52.480 --> 53:53.648
Maybe we should talk.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.409
All right.

54:07.411 --> 54:09.080
Talk.

54:14.961 --> 54:17.296
What Dad did was wrong.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.469
I couldn't see clearly back then.

54:24.762 --> 54:27.890
I just wanted the whole fucking thing
to be over with.

54:30.059 --> 54:33.021
Everyone was just trying
to hold everything together.

54:34.355 --> 54:37.150
I said what I thought I had to say.

54:38.609 --> 54:40.444
I was wrong.

54:46.367 --> 54:48.661
We were all fucking wrong.

55:00.715 --> 55:03.218
Now that Dad's gone...

55:06.762 --> 55:09.265
Fucking I don't know.
I don't know.

55:11.142 --> 55:12.810
I'd like to start over.

55:19.150 --> 55:21.569
So you still want to go fishing?

55:22.486 --> 55:24.280
What?

55:26.115 --> 55:29.785
You don't remember? The other night
you asked me, you wanted to go fishing.

55:29.994 --> 55:32.163
Still want to go fishing?

55:34.665 --> 55:35.958
Yeah, I want to go fishing.

55:40.255 --> 55:43.091
You know, you don't have to
worry about me, John.

55:44.175 --> 55:45.634
I mean...

55:46.761 --> 55:49.805
You got your own family to worry about.

55:51.766 --> 55:53.475
Just want to be able to get past all this.

55:53.893 --> 55:56.437
We are past it.

55:56.645 --> 55:58.606
It's passed.

56:05.113 --> 56:06.739
It's good to have you home.

56:08.241 --> 56:10.952
It's so good to be back.

56:32.181 --> 56:33.724
[exhales]

56:36.644 --> 56:38.104
[laughs]

56:51.700 --> 56:53.786
[♪♪♪]
