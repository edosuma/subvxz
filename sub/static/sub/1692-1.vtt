02:23.159 --> 02:25.828
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
I'm a sitting duck out here.

02:25.879 --> 02:26.829
So move then.
Come on.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.114
Charlie.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.448
Load it up.

02:30.466 --> 02:32.751
Let's go, let's go!

02:34.671 --> 02:36.088
Come on.

02:37.290 --> 02:40.175
Liquid gold, boyo.
That's it.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.754
Come on, are we
fucking done here?

03:08.788 --> 03:11.540
Boys, we're straight on to New
York, so anyone needs a piss,

03:11.591 --> 03:13.491
you take it now.
No?

03:13.509 --> 03:15.460
Then let's go.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.981
Son of a bitch.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.367
Hold up.
Slow down.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.669
He's still breathing.

03:57.703 --> 03:59.922
Fuck him.
Get him off the road.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.146
Get 'em up!

04:08.181 --> 04:10.182
Up!

04:10.216 --> 04:13.602
Get your fucking hands in the air.
Drop the heaters.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.404
- You stupid fuck.
- Drop it I said!

04:16.439 --> 04:18.490
You too, fat boy.
Drop it!

04:18.524 --> 04:20.692
Drop your weapon.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.945
You know whose
fucking load this is?

04:22.996 --> 04:25.080
It's pretty fucking
obvious now, ain't it?

04:25.114 --> 04:28.233
"Coward, monster,
vicious brute,

04:28.268 --> 04:31.169
friend to thief and prostitute,

04:31.204 --> 04:34.572
conscience dulled by demon rum,

04:34.590 --> 04:38.927
liquor, thy name's
delirium."

04:43.416 --> 04:47.752
Tomorrow we awaken
to a new dawn.

04:47.770 --> 04:50.255
And on the eve of this
momentous occasion,

04:50.273 --> 04:52.641
it is my pleasure to introduce

04:52.692 --> 04:56.261
Atlantic city's
esteemed treasurer,

04:56.279 --> 04:59.597
the honorable enoch Thompson.

05:05.288 --> 05:08.606
Mrs. McGarry, thank you
for that stirring poem.

05:08.624 --> 05:10.409
Will you send me a copy?

05:10.443 --> 05:13.078
What a nice man.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.464
Ladies.

05:15.498 --> 05:17.582
Years ago there was a young boy

05:17.616 --> 05:19.468
who lived in this very city.

05:19.502 --> 05:23.055
The winter of '88,
some of you remember,

05:23.089 --> 05:25.640
a blizzard
of biblical proportions.

05:25.675 --> 05:28.593
The family was snowbound
and freezing,

05:28.627 --> 05:32.014
without food or heat.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.517
The father vanished...
laid to waste by

05:35.568 --> 05:37.569
alcohol.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.354
And so it was left

05:39.405 --> 05:40.989
to this boy,

05:41.024 --> 05:43.692
this little man of tender years

05:43.743 --> 05:47.562
to fend for himself
and his family.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.748
Off in the cold he went,

05:49.782 --> 05:52.084
worn shoes wrapped in rags,

05:52.118 --> 05:54.870
newspaper lining
his thin wool coat,

05:54.921 --> 05:58.490
as he trudged
chest deep in snow

05:58.508 --> 06:00.425
to the rail yard,

06:00.460 --> 06:03.678
foraging on hands
and bloody knees

06:03.713 --> 06:05.747
for scraps of coal,

06:05.782 --> 06:08.333
hoping for some potatoes

06:08.351 --> 06:10.502
spilled from a ruptured sack.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.505
Finding none,

06:13.523 --> 06:16.058
he took a broom handle

06:16.109 --> 06:21.646
and in desperation,
killed his family's dinner:

06:21.680 --> 06:25.884
Three wharf rats hiding in the
hold of a ship.

06:27.870 --> 06:30.655
Terrible, yes.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.991
But the family survived.

06:35.078 --> 06:37.212
And the little boy?

06:39.082 --> 06:41.583
Well, the little boy
speaks to you tonight

06:41.634 --> 06:44.970
from this very podium.

06:47.706 --> 06:50.258
Prohibition means progress.

06:50.293 --> 06:54.513
Never again will families
be robbed of their fathers,

06:54.547 --> 06:58.100
held hostage by alcohol.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.935
How proud I am

06:59.986 --> 07:01.903
to live in a nation which,

07:01.938 --> 07:05.723
God willing, this year will finally
give s women the right to vote.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.731
Ladies, I regret to inform you

07:13.749 --> 07:16.501
that I have been called away
on urgent county business

07:16.536 --> 07:19.588
and therefore will be unable
to stay for the potluck.

07:19.622 --> 07:21.590
Shh shh.

07:21.624 --> 07:24.209
In closing, however,
let me say this:

07:24.243 --> 07:28.180
Without the continued support
of good decent women

07:28.214 --> 07:30.748
like you, men like me

07:30.766 --> 07:33.585
would be nowhere.

07:33.603 --> 07:36.888
Thank you and God bless.

07:43.929 --> 07:46.615
In the trenches
once we ate dog meat.

07:46.649 --> 07:48.733
But rats?

07:50.603 --> 07:52.370
First rule of politics, kiddo:

07:52.405 --> 07:55.040
Never let the truth get
in the way of a good story.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.959
Come on in, boys!
Don't be shy.

07:57.994 --> 08:01.946
Meet the gals who put
the "ooh" in ooh-la-la.

08:01.964 --> 08:04.583
Step right up, friends.
Whatcha waiting for?

08:04.617 --> 08:07.886
Lovely ladies
direct from Paris...

08:07.920 --> 08:09.504
France.

08:09.555 --> 08:10.839
Young ladies,

08:10.890 --> 08:12.807
I know there are attractions
that your parents

08:12.842 --> 08:14.509
would like to take you to,
but this

08:14.560 --> 08:16.845
is not one of them.
Ladies, take them away, yes.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.014
They should have been gone a
long time ago.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.849
Don't be afraid, fellas.
They won't bite...

08:20.883 --> 08:22.467
unless you want them to.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.239
- Hey, Nucky, how you doing?
- Not as good as you, Wendell.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.324
- Good evening, Nucky.
- Hey, how are ya?

08:29.358 --> 08:31.776
- How are you, Nucky?
- Nice to see you.

08:59.889 --> 09:02.006
Say it ain't so, Joe.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.286
To the end of the world!

09:20.042 --> 09:21.910
All right,
take it easy, fellas.

09:24.029 --> 09:25.914
I got it!
I got it! Over here.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.300
Hey, you got some rye?
I want some gin... gin!

09:28.334 --> 09:31.469
Thanks, ace.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.148
- Is my brother here?
- Upstairs.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.216
They all are.

10:18.225 --> 10:21.544
I wanted to arrest him, but he
had 24 hours left. I couldn't.

10:24.314 --> 10:26.265
Boys, boys, boys.

10:26.316 --> 10:29.018
Mr. Mayor, friends,

10:29.052 --> 10:31.220
fellow members
of the city council,

10:31.238 --> 10:34.073
as you know,
in less than two hours

10:34.108 --> 10:36.943
liquor will be declared
illegal by decree

10:36.994 --> 10:40.563
of the distinguished gentlemen
of our nation's congress.

10:42.065 --> 10:45.151
To those beautiful,
ignorant bastards!

10:48.839 --> 10:51.741
Rest assured that dry
though the country may be,

10:51.759 --> 10:54.293
I am in the midst
of concluding arrangements

10:54.344 --> 10:57.597
that will keep Atlantic city
wet as a mermaid's twat.

10:57.631 --> 10:59.932
Jeez, Nucky,
you're fucking mermaids now?

10:59.967 --> 11:01.551
Every vote counts,
Mr. Mayor.

11:01.585 --> 11:03.970
A republican
through and through.

11:04.021 --> 11:07.690
The opportunity that is the Volstead act
has not merely knocked, my friends,

11:07.725 --> 11:10.109
it has kicked our fucking doors in!

11:10.144 --> 11:12.729
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- Come on, George,

11:12.763 --> 11:14.647
it'll be like prohibition
never happened,

11:14.698 --> 11:17.283
but for one thing...
prices will increase twentyfold.

11:17.317 --> 11:20.369
What kind of sucker will pay three
clams for a drink worth 15Â¢?

11:20.404 --> 11:22.488
- You.
- You'll pay 12 clams

11:22.539 --> 11:24.657
for a piece of cooze
that ain't worth nothing.

11:24.708 --> 11:26.609
Yeah, you pay.
You pay.

11:26.627 --> 11:28.077
I know.

11:28.111 --> 11:30.129
Now he's...
he's on the trolley.

11:30.164 --> 11:32.215
Number one...
we got a product

11:32.249 --> 11:33.966
- a fella's gotta have.
- Yeah.

11:34.001 --> 11:36.636
Even better is that we got a
product he ain't allowed to have.

11:36.670 --> 11:39.305
- They might as well outlaw smoking.
- A man's on holiday,

11:39.339 --> 11:42.391
- believe me, he wants a drink, he'll
pay the price for it. - That's right.

11:42.426 --> 11:45.228
- How about the law? - The law?
I am the law, Georgie boy.

11:45.262 --> 11:48.514
Or are you so fucking soused you
thought I'm Lillian Gish, huh?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.984
I mean this ain't a flower.
It's not a flower.

11:52.019 --> 11:54.604
I'm gonna kick him outta here right now.
You're outta here.

11:54.638 --> 11:56.572
- The feds!
- You're under arrest.

11:56.607 --> 11:58.140
The feds, the fucking prohis.

11:58.158 --> 11:59.742
Oh, the feds,
the fucking pro...

11:59.777 --> 12:02.144
dogcatchers with badges.

12:02.162 --> 12:05.081
With all due deference
to dogcatchers.

12:06.450 --> 12:09.202
Now, as ward bosses,
you'll each be responsible

12:09.253 --> 12:11.204
for taking orders
and collecting

12:11.255 --> 12:13.756
from your restaurants,
hotels, what have you.

12:13.791 --> 12:17.159
Those orders will be reviewed
by my brother and his men,

12:17.177 --> 12:19.262
who'll supervise delivery.

12:19.296 --> 12:21.130
Which brings me
to a few personnel changes.

12:21.164 --> 12:23.499
- You all remember Jimmy Darmody?
- Welcome back, kid!

12:23.517 --> 12:25.885
- Welcome home, Jimmy.
- Welcome back, kid.

12:25.936 --> 12:27.553
- Good to see you.
- Gave them huns hell, I heard.

12:27.604 --> 12:29.021
- Sure did.
- He did.

12:29.056 --> 12:31.474
And now that he's made
the world safe for democracy,

12:31.508 --> 12:33.559
he's back to lend us
a hand too.

12:33.610 --> 12:35.728
In three weeks paddy Ryan
is taking over

12:35.779 --> 12:37.613
as chief clerk
of the fourth ward.

12:37.648 --> 12:39.515
Jimmy here'll be
pat's man Friday.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.567
- Attaboy.
- Paddy.

12:41.618 --> 12:43.870
- Congratulations, paddy.
- Gentlemen, it's an honor.

12:43.904 --> 12:46.489
- Paddy Ryan... a good man.
- Look out, Mayor,

12:46.523 --> 12:48.190
the kid'll have
your job one day.

12:48.208 --> 12:49.876
He can have it
right now if he wants it.

12:49.910 --> 12:52.378
- Give it time, Mr. Mayor.
- Welcome aboard, paddy.

12:54.798 --> 12:56.966
10, nine, eight,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.002
seven, six, five,

13:00.036 --> 13:02.872
four, three, two,

13:02.890 --> 13:05.374
one.

13:25.746 --> 13:28.164
Prohibition!

14:14.912 --> 14:16.495
Hey, where are you going?

14:16.546 --> 14:19.465
- What's eating you?
- Nothing. I don't know.

14:19.499 --> 14:22.385
- My stomach.
- Oh, go have a brioski.

14:35.148 --> 14:37.350
- Will you look at this shit?
- James.

14:39.236 --> 14:41.020
No, put it in your mouth.

14:42.138 --> 14:44.857
Dempsey... "champ was
no draft dodger.

14:44.908 --> 14:47.043
He explains his status
during war."

14:47.077 --> 14:50.246
- So what did he say? - I dunno.
He supported his mother.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.282
- It's a bunch of baloney.
- They couldn't write it if it wasn't true.

14:53.316 --> 14:55.368
Wise up, Ange.
It's a bill of goods.

14:55.419 --> 14:57.670
You think a fella would give
up that type of opportunity

14:57.704 --> 14:59.372
to go fight for his country?

15:02.042 --> 15:04.210
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

15:05.996 --> 15:09.966
Princeton wasn't exactly the
heavyweight championship, Angela.

15:12.602 --> 15:14.387
Have you given it
any more thought?

15:14.438 --> 15:17.356
I'd be 25 by the time I graduated...
almost 26.

15:17.391 --> 15:20.393
- I could go to work.
- Doing what?

15:21.695 --> 15:24.947
Painting pictures?

15:24.982 --> 15:27.016
And what about skeezix here?

15:27.034 --> 15:29.485
- Where are you going?
- Hey, sit down, eat your food.

15:29.519 --> 15:31.620
No no, come on.
You gotta eat this mush.

15:31.655 --> 15:34.740
- Get up. Come on.
What about you, right? - Yeah.

15:34.791 --> 15:36.876
Drink your milk.
One more bite.

15:36.910 --> 15:39.695
You know, you could learn
a lot working for Ryan maybe.

15:42.582 --> 15:45.468
- Are the eggs ready yet?
- Hold your horses!

15:45.502 --> 15:49.221
Your mother's screwy if she thinks
I'm gonna work for a sap like Ryan.

15:49.256 --> 15:51.924
- Ryan's a sap.
- Ryan is a sap.

15:53.209 --> 15:54.927
Don't say that.

15:54.978 --> 15:57.513
- I drank all my milk.
- Good.

15:59.816 --> 16:01.767
So what are you gonna do?

16:03.270 --> 16:05.154
I'm gonna talk to Nucky.

16:06.606 --> 16:09.358
I don't know, two years
killing Jerries

16:09.392 --> 16:12.778
doesn't exactly prepare you
for a whole lot else.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.872
As prohibition agents,

16:22.906 --> 16:26.241
you represent the finest
America has to offer...

16:26.259 --> 16:30.046
the first line of defense in
the war against illegal liquor,

16:30.080 --> 16:32.581
stout-hearted men,

16:32.599 --> 16:36.102
centurions for the modern age,

16:36.136 --> 16:40.556
unswerving in duty
and incorruptible

16:40.590 --> 16:42.408
in character.

16:43.577 --> 16:45.227
Raise your right hands.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.398
- I...
- I...

16:49.433 --> 16:51.567
...State your name...

16:51.601 --> 16:54.703
- ...Do so solemnly swear...
- ...Do so solemnly swear...

16:54.738 --> 16:58.407
...To uphold the laws of the
constitution of the United States...

16:58.442 --> 17:01.744
...To uphold the laws of the
constitution of the United States...

17:01.778 --> 17:04.246
...To root out criminality
in all forms...

17:04.280 --> 17:06.781
...To root out
criminality in all forms...

17:06.800 --> 17:09.335
...And vigorously uphold
all laws...

17:28.137 --> 17:29.905
Nuck.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.607
Nucky.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.977
Oh.
What time is it?

17:34.995 --> 17:36.979
2:30.

17:39.666 --> 17:42.151
- Nucky, are you up?
- What the fuck's the matter?

17:42.169 --> 17:45.504
There's a lady waiting to see you.
She's been waiting over an hour.

17:45.539 --> 17:47.957
She says it is urgent.
She's pregnant.

17:47.991 --> 17:50.492
What?

17:50.510 --> 17:54.263
- You met her last night.
- Last night?

17:54.297 --> 17:56.048
She saw you talk or something.

17:56.099 --> 17:58.500
Ah ah!
The tempremence league.

18:00.303 --> 18:03.189
Why didn't you say so?

18:03.223 --> 18:05.891
- I just did.
- "Pregnant woman here to see you"...

18:05.942 --> 18:07.726
Give me a fucking nosebleed.

18:07.777 --> 18:09.178
I-I-I...
I would never...

18:09.196 --> 18:10.813
I am so sorry.
I would never inter...

18:10.847 --> 18:12.731
... Inter... interrupt.

18:12.782 --> 18:14.450
I go. I...

18:16.403 --> 18:18.454
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Brighton.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.289
We got a nice
high floor, right?

18:20.323 --> 18:21.707
I want to look at the water.

18:21.741 --> 18:24.660
Oh, rest assured, sir, all our
rooms have an ocean view.

18:24.694 --> 18:26.361
- Boys.
- Mr. Torrio.

18:26.379 --> 18:28.881
Rothstein.
See, I told you he'd come.

18:30.634 --> 18:33.169
Big Jim Colosimo,
Arnold Rothstein,

18:33.203 --> 18:35.171
and Charlie Luciano.

18:35.205 --> 18:36.972
Charlie, how are you?

18:40.760 --> 18:43.345
How you doing?

18:43.379 --> 18:45.380
Come on.

19:00.664 --> 19:03.199
You must please come this way.

19:06.836 --> 19:09.421
David, I am so sorry I'm late.

19:10.406 --> 19:12.625
Tell Nucky I ain't got all day.

19:17.047 --> 19:20.382
Mrs. Schroeder to see you.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.807
Please, have a seat.

19:28.858 --> 19:30.726
May I offer you tea?

19:30.760 --> 19:33.646
- Thank you, I'm fine.
- No, it's no trouble.

19:33.697 --> 19:35.564
- Have you eaten?
- Thank you no.

19:35.598 --> 19:37.983
I mean I have, yes.

19:38.034 --> 19:39.985
I've eaten, but I...

19:40.036 --> 19:42.204
Okay, relax.
Please.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.708
- No more appointments.
- Ja.

19:47.777 --> 19:50.212
Is that a bit of the old country
I hear in your voice?

19:51.831 --> 19:54.083
My husband says I sound
like an immigrant.

19:54.117 --> 19:56.385
Ah. But we're all
immigrants, are we not?

20:02.759 --> 20:04.760
Tell me how I can help you.

20:04.794 --> 20:07.462
First of all, sir,

20:07.480 --> 20:09.565
I would never...

20:11.401 --> 20:14.136
but when I heard
you speak, I...

20:14.154 --> 20:16.355
There there now.

20:18.275 --> 20:20.642
My apologies.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.611
My husband,

20:22.645 --> 20:25.447
he has a weakness
for the dice games.

20:25.481 --> 20:28.834
He's a drinker as well
on occasion.

20:33.290 --> 20:35.157
Is this your first child?

20:35.175 --> 20:37.926
Our third.

20:37.961 --> 20:40.129
We've a boy and a girl.

20:42.799 --> 20:45.200
Do you have children
of your own, Mr. Thompson?

20:47.137 --> 20:48.721
I'm sorry.

20:48.772 --> 20:51.023
That was quite forward.

20:51.057 --> 20:53.842
Not at all.
I do not.

20:56.363 --> 20:59.198
I lost my wife to consumption.

21:01.318 --> 21:03.736
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:03.787 --> 21:06.588
She was very pretty.

21:07.624 --> 21:09.208
She was.

21:11.411 --> 21:13.379
Hey, uh, Nucky?

21:13.413 --> 21:16.582
- I'm gonna go now.
- Oh, I'm in a meeting.

21:16.633 --> 21:18.550
No, please, I...

21:18.585 --> 21:21.754
No, Mrs. Schroeder,
Lucy Danziger.

21:21.805 --> 21:23.505
Hello.

21:23.539 --> 21:26.208
Hi.

21:30.380 --> 21:34.483
So am I gonna see ya later?

21:34.517 --> 21:37.019
I'll get in touch.

21:43.576 --> 21:46.578
- I'm sorry. I...
- No.

21:46.613 --> 21:49.665
- I... she's my...
- It's...

21:53.420 --> 21:55.621
Does your husband work?

21:55.672 --> 21:58.173
He's a baker's helper.

21:58.208 --> 22:01.427
But till tourist season
and with winter,

22:01.461 --> 22:04.046
and the children
without boots, I...

22:06.082 --> 22:08.217
Your story moved me so.

22:10.270 --> 22:13.772
If you could see your way
to give him a job, sir?

22:15.892 --> 22:18.560
As you say...
until tourist season.

22:20.096 --> 22:22.197
However...

22:22.232 --> 22:24.199
This should see you
through winter.

22:24.234 --> 22:25.901
I'm not here
looking for charity.

22:25.935 --> 22:28.203
I insist.

22:30.123 --> 22:33.575
I don't know what to say,
how to thank you.

22:36.446 --> 22:39.248
I'd be honored to name
my child after you.

22:39.282 --> 22:41.383
Enoch?

22:41.418 --> 22:43.469
You couldn't possibly
be so cruel.

22:47.623 --> 22:49.508
Jimmy?

22:49.559 --> 22:53.178
- Will you see that Mrs. Schroeder gets home?
- I'm fine to walk, please.

22:53.229 --> 22:55.097
No no no, you are
in no condition.

22:55.131 --> 22:57.966
- Thank you, Mr. Thompson.
- Sure.

22:57.984 --> 22:59.634
Pardon me.

22:59.652 --> 23:02.471
Your friends from Chicago checked in.
The New York gangs too.

23:02.489 --> 23:04.973
- We're all set for tonight then?
- 8:00, the traymore.

23:04.991 --> 23:07.192
- Good. - Say, Nuck, I was
hoping to bend your ear...

23:07.243 --> 23:09.495
Drop her off then meet me
at the pier later.

23:13.082 --> 23:16.668
Â¶ The laddie told the girlie
he must go away Â¶

23:16.703 --> 23:21.173
Â¶ oh, and her little heart
with grief 'most broke Â¶

23:21.207 --> 23:23.375
Â¶ well, she said,
"you know I love you, honey Â¶

23:23.426 --> 23:25.544
Â¶ I love you, honey,
best of all Â¶

23:25.595 --> 23:30.299
Â¶ so, baby, don't go away" Â¶

23:30.333 --> 23:36.221
Â¶ just as he went to go Â¶

23:36.272 --> 23:40.776
Â¶ it grieved the girlie so Â¶

23:41.945 --> 23:44.196
Â¶ these words Â¶

23:44.230 --> 23:50.118
Â¶ he heard her say Â¶

23:50.153 --> 23:52.621
Â¶ some Â¶

23:52.655 --> 23:54.706
Â¶ of Â¶

23:54.741 --> 23:58.544
Â¶ these days Â¶

23:58.578 --> 24:03.081
Â¶ oh, you'll miss me, honey Â¶

24:03.132 --> 24:06.668
Â¶ some of these days Â¶

24:06.702 --> 24:10.389
Â¶ you're gonna feel so lonely Â¶

24:11.707 --> 24:15.477
Â¶ you're gonna miss
my hugging Â¶

24:15.512 --> 24:19.398
Â¶ you're gonna
miss my kissing Â¶

24:19.432 --> 24:23.602
Â¶ you're gonna miss me, honey Â¶

24:23.653 --> 24:29.775
Â¶ when I'm far away Â¶

24:31.244 --> 24:34.863
Â¶ I feel so lonely Â¶

24:34.897 --> 24:38.700
Â¶ just for you only Â¶

24:38.734 --> 24:42.737
Â¶ Mmm, you know, honey Â¶

24:42.755 --> 24:46.458
Â¶ I let you have your way Â¶

24:46.509 --> 24:50.929
Â¶ and when you leave me Â¶

24:50.964 --> 24:54.016
Â¶ I know it will grieve me... Â¶

24:54.050 --> 24:56.969
- It's best you leave me here.
- What was that?

24:57.020 --> 24:59.555
- Please could you leave me here?
- Right here?

24:59.589 --> 25:01.356
- Okay.
- Thank you.

25:10.766 --> 25:13.619
- May I help you inside?
- I'm fine.

25:13.653 --> 25:15.370
- You sure?
- Thank you.

25:22.328 --> 25:24.463
- Where have you been?
- I was, um...

25:24.497 --> 25:26.331
Get in the house.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.801
Who the hell is that?

25:39.646 --> 25:42.898
Gather around and
behold, ladies and gentlemen,

25:42.932 --> 25:46.068
the catch of the day!
For Neptune yields

25:46.102 --> 25:48.737
the treasures from his
watery kingdom:

25:48.771 --> 25:50.989
sea bass, eel, blue crabs,

25:51.024 --> 25:53.025
king mackerel and flounder...

25:53.076 --> 25:54.326
Nucky.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.863
Bill McCoy, as I live
and breathe.

25:57.914 --> 26:00.499
- Have you been up north lately?
- Funny you should ask.

26:00.533 --> 26:02.817
I just got back...
a little souvenir shopping.

26:02.835 --> 26:05.654
There are things you just
can't get back home anymore.

26:06.822 --> 26:08.890
A load's coming in
tomorrow night.

26:12.045 --> 26:14.329
Canadian club, straight
from the distillery.

26:14.347 --> 26:16.682
500 crates at 100 clams per.

26:16.716 --> 26:19.501
- That's a nice even number.
- It keeps the arithmetic easy.

26:19.519 --> 26:22.721
- I am a simple fisherman, after all.
- Not anymore, you're not.

26:23.773 --> 26:25.474
"And he took
the loaves and fishes,

26:25.508 --> 26:27.859
looked at his disciples
and said,

26:27.894 --> 26:30.696
'fuck it. We're goin' into
the whiskey business.'"

26:32.231 --> 26:34.533
How much for the whole kaboodle?

26:34.567 --> 26:37.536
It's a big city, Billy boy,
a lot of thirsty people.

26:39.455 --> 26:41.573
40 grand.

26:41.624 --> 26:44.042
35 and we'll do it once a week.

26:44.077 --> 26:45.860
What does that come to a crate?

26:45.878 --> 26:49.548
A fuck of a lot more than you're paying for it.
That's for sure.

26:49.582 --> 26:51.717
Do we have a deal or no?

26:54.504 --> 26:57.889
- Dirty chiseler. - You'll hear from
my brother about the particulars.

26:57.924 --> 27:00.375
Where are you going?
I thought we were having a drink.

27:00.393 --> 27:02.811
I already got what I wanted.
What the fuck would we talk about?

27:02.845 --> 27:04.429
Say, Nucky,

27:04.480 --> 27:06.264
- about that thing.
- What thing?

27:06.315 --> 27:08.567
- The thing I wanted to talk to you about.
- Wait, I gotta get cigarettes.

27:31.290 --> 27:33.458
Nucky Thompson is here.

27:35.128 --> 27:37.963
Mr. Thompson,
what an honor.

27:38.014 --> 27:40.682
He was a good man.
My deepest condolences.

27:40.717 --> 27:43.752
I hadn't even realized
you knew my husband.

27:43.770 --> 27:47.556
Oh, of course. He was a fine fellow.
Just last month we spoke.

27:47.590 --> 27:49.691
Oh...

27:49.726 --> 27:51.476
But the laryngectomy.

28:08.544 --> 28:10.996
Fellas, meet the missus.

28:11.047 --> 28:12.798
She ain't much on personality,

28:12.832 --> 28:15.467
but she don't talk back none neither.

28:17.286 --> 28:19.788
What's the matter, kid,
never seen a stiff before?

28:19.806 --> 28:23.091
I've seen a couple.

28:24.811 --> 28:27.562
I'm short on time, Mickey.
What'd you want to show me?

28:27.597 --> 28:30.015
So much for the niceties.

28:49.502 --> 28:51.253
My factory, gentlemen.

28:51.287 --> 28:53.955
- Quite an operation.
- 10 shiners,

28:53.989 --> 28:56.124
two shifts, 24 hours a day...

28:56.158 --> 28:58.960
Gotta figure we're puttin' out
close to 2,000 crates a week.

28:58.994 --> 29:00.846
And that's just for starters.

29:00.880 --> 29:04.165
- None of this is legit?
- Not once they get through with it.

29:04.183 --> 29:06.101
One part real,
eight parts water.

29:06.135 --> 29:09.471
You heat it up, let it cool then add
your alcohol to bring up your proof.

29:09.505 --> 29:12.006
- Where do you get your alcohol?
- Potatoes.

29:12.024 --> 29:15.527
You let 'em ferment.
It smell's rough,

29:15.561 --> 29:17.813
but compared to a stiff,
it's fuckin' lilacs.

29:17.847 --> 29:19.781
After you add the alcohol,

29:19.816 --> 29:22.617
you throw in your caramel
coloring, your oil of rye,

29:22.652 --> 29:24.853
bourbon... depending
what you want.

29:24.871 --> 29:27.539
- You can make scotch too?
- Naturally.

29:27.573 --> 29:30.242
You just gotta add some
carbonyl though for the bead.

29:30.293 --> 29:32.694
- What's that?
- The bubbles.

29:32.712 --> 29:34.296
Higher the proof,

29:34.330 --> 29:36.498
more bead it's supposed
to have.

29:36.532 --> 29:38.583
Go on, bottoms up.

29:48.477 --> 29:51.346
- What the fuck's in this shit?
- Carbonyl, like I said.

29:51.380 --> 29:53.815
Formaldehyde.

29:53.850 --> 29:56.351
- Formaldehyde, huh?
- Hey hey hey hey!

29:56.385 --> 29:59.387
- What are you doing?
- Cocksucker!

30:06.829 --> 30:09.531
What the hell's wrong with you?
Out!

30:09.565 --> 30:11.065
Now! Beat it.

30:12.067 --> 30:14.920
Jimmy, out!

30:19.175 --> 30:22.043
- Stupid bohunk.
- It was just a gag, okay?

30:22.077 --> 30:25.380
- Yeah, you're a real pistol.
- Enough with the bohunk cracks.

30:25.414 --> 30:28.016
- My name's Doyle now.
- What?

30:28.050 --> 30:30.050
I changed it.
I ain't Mickey Cusick no more.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.206
- Who's after you?
- Nobody.

30:34.241 --> 30:37.409
- Then why Doyle?
- It sounds better is all.

30:37.443 --> 30:39.879
A rose by any other name.

30:39.913 --> 30:42.114
What's that supposed to mean?

30:42.132 --> 30:44.500
Read a fucking book.

30:47.954 --> 30:50.890
- What, are you off your nut?
- You didn't drink that piss, I did.

30:50.924 --> 30:53.309
- You're still breathing, aren't you?
- Yeah, so's he.

30:53.343 --> 30:55.427
That's the problem...
he's still breathing.

30:55.461 --> 30:58.814
- He's part of my operation, kid.
- You don't need him.

30:58.849 --> 31:01.267
What would you know about it?

31:01.301 --> 31:04.403
What's with you? And don't tell
me it's your goddamned stomach.

31:04.437 --> 31:06.572
You want to know what's with me?
Honestly?

31:06.606 --> 31:09.024
- Yeah.
- Paddy Ryan.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.944
You really expect me
to go work for that Mick?

31:11.978 --> 31:14.029
You'd rather be my driver?

31:14.080 --> 31:15.698
Of course not, Nuck.
It's just you...

31:15.749 --> 31:18.450
you make Ryan clerk?
I can run rings around that chump.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.653
Oh, listen to Bonnie
prince Charlie.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.323
C'mon, Nuck, you were assistant
sheriff when you were my age.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.877
And for eight years prior I spent night
and day kissing the commodore's ass.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.845
I've been kissing your ass
since I was 12!

31:29.880 --> 31:31.714
And what about
the last three years?

31:33.934 --> 31:35.551
I wanted to serve my country.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.853
- And nearly get yourself killed.
- Sssh.

31:37.888 --> 31:40.723
Did it ever occur how your
girl might feel about that?

31:40.774 --> 31:44.560
- Your little boy?
- Look, if that was my fate, then so be it.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.845
And he wants to be in politics.

31:46.863 --> 31:50.282
You know who dies for their country, kid?
Fucking rubes, that's who.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.453
Yeah well, I'm home now, Nuck.

31:54.487 --> 31:57.489
- So how about it?
- Had you stayed in school,

31:57.523 --> 31:59.792
it'd have been you
in that job and not Ryan.

31:59.826 --> 32:02.294
All right, so you're punishing me.
Is that it?

32:02.329 --> 32:04.713
- You're punishing me.
- I'm telling you to slow down,

32:04.748 --> 32:07.633
get the lay of the land.
You've been home now what? A month?

32:09.869 --> 32:12.204
Nucky, I'm not
the same kid that left.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.476
I've seen things.

32:17.510 --> 32:21.647
- I've done things. - Well, how are
we gonna keep you down on the farm?

32:21.681 --> 32:23.882
- I'm serious.
- I know.

32:25.268 --> 32:27.236
All right, look,

32:27.270 --> 32:29.221
that's 1,000 bucks.
Go buy yourself

32:29.239 --> 32:31.357
- a decent suit...
- I don't want your money!

32:31.391 --> 32:34.109
A fella hands you a grand,
you tell him to fuck himself?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.561
You're a pip, kid, I gotta say.

32:36.580 --> 32:40.199
Nucky, all I want
is an opportunity.

32:40.233 --> 32:43.452
This is America, ain't it?
Who the fuck's stopping you?

32:44.871 --> 32:47.506
Come on, let's go.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.626
- One for you.
- Two!

32:50.677 --> 32:54.046
- And two.
- Two pile of soups.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.382
And one for you.

32:59.052 --> 33:01.887
The automobile?

33:01.921 --> 33:04.023
Tell me again how you came
to find yourself

33:04.057 --> 33:06.442
getting chauffeured
around town.

33:07.611 --> 33:10.062
I told you.

33:10.096 --> 33:13.198
I was walking past the church
when I felt faint.

33:13.233 --> 33:14.933
Mr. Thompson saw me

33:14.951 --> 33:17.736
and was kind enough to have
his driver see me home.

33:20.606 --> 33:22.291
C'mere.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.384
You are a little warm.

33:34.087 --> 33:36.555
And you're feeling better
now though, are you?

33:36.589 --> 33:38.223
I am.

33:41.177 --> 33:43.012
And this?

33:43.063 --> 33:44.980
How did this find its way
under the mattress?

33:45.015 --> 33:47.632
- Mommy. - That money
belongs to the children.

33:47.651 --> 33:50.019
Like fuck it does!
Where'd you get it?

33:50.070 --> 33:52.521
- Huh?
- Never you mind where I got it.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.940
By whoring yourself out?

33:54.974 --> 33:57.409
You whore!

34:00.313 --> 34:02.748
- You gimme that money.
- No, you sit down

34:02.782 --> 34:04.750
or you'll get the belt!

34:08.588 --> 34:11.206
- Eat your food.
- I want mommy!

34:11.257 --> 34:14.176
Eat your food.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.052
Ahh.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.668
Ohh.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.505
Thank you.

34:28.975 --> 34:30.775
This is them.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.563
Gentlemen.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.899
Enoch Thompson.

34:36.949 --> 34:39.034
Okay.

34:39.069 --> 34:41.370
- Big Jim Colosimo.
- Mr. Thompasoni.

34:41.404 --> 34:43.237
- Nice to see you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.741
Come on in.
Now if you come back here in July,

34:45.792 --> 34:47.859
at the pool they have
the sea nymph festival.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.695
- Seamina festival?
- You should come for that.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.880
- Got them.
- Like mermaids.

34:52.916 --> 34:55.167
January 16th,
it's 8:03 P.M.

34:55.201 --> 34:57.536
Johnny Torrio meeting
with Nucky Thompson.

34:57.554 --> 35:00.222
- Which one's Torrio?
- The gray tweed.

35:00.256 --> 35:02.474
"Gray tweed."

35:04.544 --> 35:07.546
We got a bead on Rothstein.
He just came in with Luciano.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.881
This other fellow
is big Jim Colosimo.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.067
- Come again?
- In the homburg.

35:12.102 --> 35:14.269
- The hamburg?
- The homburg.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.321
Never mind.
He took it off.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.942
- Who's this fella now?
- Who?

35:19.993 --> 35:21.994
- The guy in the brown suit.
- That's the concierge.

35:22.028 --> 35:25.864
- It's "Sierge"?
- The manager, he works here.

35:27.283 --> 35:30.035
So the red tie, that's big Jim?

35:31.171 --> 35:33.122
Does that man look big to you?

35:33.173 --> 35:35.740
- How's that?
- It's Arnold Rothstein.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.926
So it's not Colosimo?

35:37.961 --> 35:42.347
- Arnold Rothstein.
- And Nucky Luciano.

35:42.382 --> 35:43.682
- Lucky!
- Come again?

35:43.716 --> 35:46.468
Lucky Luciano, Nucky Thompson.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.256
So... who's Colosimo?

36:01.568 --> 36:03.619
Fella goes to divorce court.
The judge says

36:03.653 --> 36:05.988
"I've decided to give
your wife $25 a week."

36:06.039 --> 36:08.106
Fella says "that's mighty
swell of you, judge.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.609
I'll try to send her a few
clams myself now and again."

36:14.964 --> 36:16.548
- Clams?
- Money.

36:16.583 --> 36:19.051
Clams, money, capiro?

36:19.085 --> 36:21.220
Money, capiro?

36:21.254 --> 36:24.789
You should put it
in some lobster too, no?

36:26.792 --> 36:28.310
No!

36:28.344 --> 36:30.846
No no no.
None for me.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.797
You're a law-abiding
citizen, eh?

36:32.816 --> 36:34.933
- No, teetotaler.
Never touch it. - Oh.

36:34.967 --> 36:38.187
- He's the lightweight.
- I like to stay sharp at the tables.

36:38.238 --> 36:41.023
Yeah, sharp.
The way he wins, he wants to be sharp.

36:41.074 --> 36:44.827
Last year he clear $2 million just
f the world series alone, eh?

36:44.861 --> 36:47.812
- Two milliones.
- And they call that one lucky.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.032
What do you think
I'm sitting next to him for?

36:50.083 --> 36:52.618
Hey, boy, do you have
any Caruso records?

36:52.652 --> 36:55.370
- Enrico Caruso?
- That's fine.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.206
- Caruso, no?
- Go find some and play it.

36:57.257 --> 36:58.790
- Put it on, eh?
- Tell the boys.

36:58.824 --> 37:00.709
It's like funeral music here.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.827
How's the chow, fellas?

37:02.846 --> 37:04.546
- Fine.
- Delicious.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.665
Oh, ma, she's the best, eh?

37:06.683 --> 37:09.134
- You should come to my
restaurant sometime, eh? - Sure.

37:09.168 --> 37:12.187
I treat you nice, eh?
If you like to eat, you eat.

37:12.222 --> 37:14.439
If you don't like to eat...

37:15.775 --> 37:18.227
- Hmm?
- Who doesn't like to eat?

37:19.729 --> 37:22.064
Chicago's a fine town.

37:22.115 --> 37:23.782
It ain't New York,
that's for sure.

37:23.816 --> 37:25.651
New York ain't New York now
with prohibition.

37:25.685 --> 37:27.870
It will be if I have
something to say about it.

37:27.904 --> 37:29.988
Ain't that the reason
we're all here tonight?

37:32.358 --> 37:34.743
As you know, in light
of recent developments,

37:34.794 --> 37:37.629
I thought it might be of mutual
benefit for you boys to meet.

37:37.664 --> 37:40.582
All the way from chi-town out
of the goodness of his heart.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.051
When I say mutual benefit,
I mean mine too.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.053
I didn't come here
for the pastasciutta.

37:45.088 --> 37:48.507
I'll be expecting
a matchmaking fee.

37:48.541 --> 37:50.592
Of course.

37:50.643 --> 37:54.563
See, in addition to their other enterprises, Messrs.
Rothstein and Luciano

37:54.597 --> 37:58.016
have significant interests in the
cabaret business back in New York.

37:58.050 --> 37:59.735
And a man such as yourself,

37:59.769 --> 38:02.738
with both political influence as
well as a passing acquaintance

38:02.772 --> 38:04.823
with the seafaring types
of the Atlantic ocean...

38:04.857 --> 38:06.992
hey, Johnny, talk English.

38:08.444 --> 38:11.246
Salvatore...

38:12.165 --> 38:13.198
...Big business.

38:13.232 --> 38:15.167
So what's the difference?

38:19.255 --> 38:21.290
Go ahead, do what you
were going to do.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.908
Could you fix us up or no?

38:23.927 --> 38:27.129
We'll take alls we can get
up to 2,000 crates a month.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.348
For starters.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.220
You young fellas...

38:35.254 --> 38:37.806
no appreciation for
the art of conversation.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.445
All right, yeah, I gotta piss.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.868
I apologize.

38:49.902 --> 38:54.272
Ambition can be read
as impatience sometimes.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.625
- Arrogance too.
- Ehh...

38:58.795 --> 39:01.213
I have a friend...
a judge.

39:01.247 --> 39:03.415
His daughter's wedding
is in a week.

39:03.449 --> 39:07.002
I'd like to be able to accommodate
him and their 700 guests.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.554
- You haven't stockpiled?
- Mmmm.

39:09.589 --> 39:12.057
All sold already.
I'm coming up short.

39:13.793 --> 39:16.345
Well, I have a load
coming in tomorrow.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.680
500 crates Canadian club.

39:18.731 --> 39:21.850
Originally I'd planned to keep it,
but seeing how I'd like to start

39:21.901 --> 39:25.020
our relationship off on the right
foot, how about I let you have it?

39:25.071 --> 39:28.323
- How much?
- 60 grand for the entire load.

39:28.358 --> 39:30.826
But you use your own men
for the pickup.

39:39.952 --> 39:42.754
Send me over the details, we'll
settle up in cash tomorrow.

39:42.789 --> 39:44.489
All right.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.675
All right, gentlemen,

39:46.709 --> 39:48.660
- salut.
- Salut.

39:48.678 --> 39:49.928
Cheers.

39:49.962 --> 39:51.713
Cheers.

39:52.665 --> 39:54.933
I was in Chicago once.

39:54.967 --> 39:58.854
- Good steaks.
- It's all right.

39:58.888 --> 40:00.972
A little cold,
but so is Brooklyn.

40:01.006 --> 40:03.007
You get used to it, I guess.

40:03.026 --> 40:06.194
Summer of '17 I passed through
there on my way to camp Grant.

40:08.147 --> 40:09.781
Doughboy, huh?

40:09.816 --> 40:11.850
- Uh-huh.
- Me too.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.852
The lost battalion.

40:14.787 --> 40:16.071
No kidding.

40:17.690 --> 40:20.242
How about you?
You see any action?

40:20.293 --> 40:22.544
Little bit.

40:22.578 --> 40:25.247
Caught some shrapnel
from a Jerry's grenade.

40:25.298 --> 40:29.134
- Spent eight months in the hospital.
- Jesus.

40:32.672 --> 40:35.090
Say, let me ask you something.

40:36.041 --> 40:37.843
A guy like Rothstein,

40:37.877 --> 40:39.811
what's a fella like that worth?

40:39.846 --> 40:43.265
Him?
10 million at least.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.484
- On the level?
- He's as big as they come.

40:45.518 --> 40:48.720
Christ, Luciano's sitting
on a half a million.

40:48.738 --> 40:52.056
I know that for a fact.
Got a spread on park Avenue.

40:52.075 --> 40:55.193
You make that much
running card games?

40:55.227 --> 40:56.828
Card hijacking.

40:56.863 --> 40:59.114
He's a fucking
dope peddler too.

40:59.165 --> 41:02.000
Did six months for pushing
heroin a couple years back.

41:02.034 --> 41:04.002
But he only did six months?

41:04.036 --> 41:05.837
Yeah, he bought a judge.

41:05.872 --> 41:07.839
Oh right.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.209
Jeez, a half million dollars...
can you imagine that?

41:11.243 --> 41:14.346
How old is...
what is he, like our age?

41:14.380 --> 41:16.748
22, 23 maybe.

41:24.857 --> 41:28.110
You guys gonna get into
the liquor business too?

41:28.144 --> 41:31.563
Losimo says no.
Too much heat from the law.

41:31.597 --> 41:34.933
Says there's enough money
in our whorehouses.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.202
But you don't agree?

41:37.236 --> 41:40.104
I'm Johnny's muscle.
Who gives a fuck what I think?

41:40.123 --> 41:42.324
If you get
in trouble, don't call me.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.826
You call my brother.
And so what you want to do...

41:44.877 --> 41:48.046
just ask for lolly.
He'll be expecting you.

41:49.632 --> 41:51.800
I'd wish you luck, but it
sounds like you don't need it.

41:51.834 --> 41:53.618
- We make our own luck.
- True enough.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.137
Hey, nice talking to you, huh?

41:55.171 --> 41:57.339
- You too.
- Jimmy Darmody.

41:57.390 --> 41:59.474
- Al Capone.
- All right, Al.

42:00.626 --> 42:02.677
Mr. Thompson, thank you
very very much.

42:02.712 --> 42:06.231
The lobsters are very good.
You paid. I'm a happy man.

42:06.265 --> 42:08.567
Next time we come to your
place, you pay for it.

42:08.601 --> 42:10.602
- Eh, any time.
- You kick in the clams.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.304
- Ahhh!
- A joke, yeah.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.807
- Thanks again. A pleasure.
- You come to Chicago,

42:15.842 --> 42:17.909
- I fix you up.
- All right.

42:17.944 --> 42:21.363
Jimmy, stop with the clams.

42:21.414 --> 42:25.167
- But, you know... - It's a joke.
Americans... they like to make a joke.

43:05.741 --> 43:08.076
- Hey, slow down, champ.
- You buy me candy.

43:08.127 --> 43:10.378
No Taffy.
He looks like fatty Arbuckle Jr.

43:10.413 --> 43:12.864
- Hey!
- No no no, sweetie, sweetie.

43:12.882 --> 43:14.666
- This way, sweetie.
- Come here.

43:14.700 --> 43:16.218
- This way.
- Come here, Tommy.

43:16.252 --> 43:17.969
- Stay with daddy.
- Come here.

43:18.004 --> 43:21.039
- Maybe we should get a photo.
- No, I don't feel like it today.

43:21.057 --> 43:23.475
James Darmody?
Ma'am.

43:23.509 --> 43:25.560
- That's right.
- Special Agent van Alden,

43:25.595 --> 43:27.229
bureau of internal revenue.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.482
- Can I help you?
- Perhaps.

43:30.516 --> 43:32.684
- Will you come with me?
- Jimmy.

43:35.071 --> 43:36.605
It's okay, dear.
Go on home.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.607
What's this about?

43:38.658 --> 43:40.442
It's fine.
I'll see you at home.

43:40.493 --> 43:41.743
Thank you, ma'am.

43:47.533 --> 43:49.534
Distinguished service cross,

43:49.568 --> 43:52.787
battle of Saint...

43:52.839 --> 43:55.173
- How do you say this?
- Mihiel.

43:56.926 --> 43:58.627
Seems to me

43:58.678 --> 44:00.545
you're a man on the come.

44:00.579 --> 44:03.181
I'm doing all right.

44:03.216 --> 44:05.433
College man too...
Princeton.

44:07.253 --> 44:08.854
For a while.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.059
Am I in trouble or something?

44:14.093 --> 44:16.311
Guilty conscience?

44:17.697 --> 44:19.948
You mind telling me
what a go-getter like you

44:19.982 --> 44:22.517
is doing working
for a crook like Thompson?

44:24.070 --> 44:26.788
It's not like that. Mr.
Thompson is a pillar of our community.

44:26.822 --> 44:30.075
Tell it to Sweeney.
We know all about him and his little fiefdom.

44:30.109 --> 44:32.077
The election rigging,
the graft...

44:32.111 --> 44:34.412
none of which
we're interested in.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.884
- What are you interested in?
- Liquor...

44:38.918 --> 44:41.887
Its illegal importation
and manufacture.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.796
How'd you like to come
work for the bureau?

44:56.969 --> 44:59.487
- I got a bum leg.
- Suppose I say you don't?

45:02.491 --> 45:05.493
You got a wife,
young son at home.

45:08.414 --> 45:11.950
It's an honorable
profession, James,

45:11.984 --> 45:14.169
plenty of room for advancement.

45:17.873 --> 45:20.458
It's a godly pursuit.

45:28.884 --> 45:30.969
Could I have one
of those cigarettes?

45:33.172 --> 45:35.273
- Give him a light.
- Sure.

45:38.894 --> 45:41.896
You do go to church,
don't you, Mr. Darmody?

45:46.068 --> 45:47.736
Yeah, sure.

45:47.787 --> 45:50.121
Well then...

45:50.156 --> 45:52.457
You know, right?

45:56.078 --> 45:59.914
Yeah... what?
Know what?

46:04.153 --> 46:06.838
- Giddy up, cowboy.
- Lucy, stop... stop saying that.

46:06.872 --> 46:09.507
Come on, daddy.

46:09.541 --> 46:12.060
- Giddy up, cowboy.
- Lucy, stop!

46:12.094 --> 46:14.312
- What?
- With the cowboy shit.

46:14.347 --> 46:17.232
- It's distracting.
- Okay, Nucky, come on.

46:17.266 --> 46:19.017
Oh yeah.

46:24.991 --> 46:26.608
Nucky!

46:26.659 --> 46:29.244
What?!

46:29.278 --> 46:32.580
I heard screaming.
Are you l right?

46:32.615 --> 46:34.332
May I enter?

46:34.367 --> 46:38.119
- No! Hat do you want?
- Steinman's on the wire.

46:38.170 --> 46:39.704
Oh Christ.

46:39.738 --> 46:42.841
- What?
- All right.

46:42.875 --> 46:45.960
He is always interrupting us!

46:46.012 --> 46:48.263
Jeez Louise.

46:48.297 --> 46:50.098
What?

46:51.350 --> 46:54.686
Screaming?
We were fucking, Eddie!

46:54.720 --> 46:56.921
Fucking.

47:00.726 --> 47:03.061
- Hello?
- It's lolly.

47:03.095 --> 47:05.363
Hey listen, your friend
from New York, the bankroll?

47:05.398 --> 47:08.766
- He just took us for 90 grand.
- What?

47:08.784 --> 47:11.236
16 hours and he wants
to keep going.

47:11.270 --> 47:13.905
We ain't that flush
right now, Nuck.

47:17.159 --> 47:19.160
All right, I'll be right there.

47:23.499 --> 47:25.333
- Eddie!
- Ja?

47:25.384 --> 47:29.220
- Tell Jimmy to bring the car around.
- Jimmy called to be out sick.

47:29.255 --> 47:32.223
Son of a bitch.

47:35.627 --> 47:37.595
- Lucy, open the door.
- No!

47:37.629 --> 47:39.597
Oh, come on, baby.
I gotta get dressed.

47:39.631 --> 47:41.766
No fucking way!

47:41.800 --> 47:43.818
Go spend time with Eddie.

47:43.853 --> 47:45.904
He's obviously more
important than me.

47:45.938 --> 47:47.355
I...

47:47.406 --> 47:50.191
no, he's not more
important than you.

47:50.242 --> 47:54.028
But Arnold Rothstein
and $90,000 is more important!

47:54.080 --> 47:56.364
- Open the goddamn door!
- No!

47:59.001 --> 48:01.819
Why don't
you go hang out with him?

48:01.837 --> 48:04.172
Yeah, you do it.
My back.

48:04.206 --> 48:06.758
Get in there.
Yeah yeah!

48:06.792 --> 48:09.594
Please, Lucy, it's very
important for Eddie to come in.

48:09.628 --> 48:13.014
- Open the...
- Open the fucking door!

48:31.517 --> 48:33.851
- Where is he?
- Eating with the Italian fellow.

48:33.869 --> 48:36.738
I didn't want to say nothing,
but this Rothstein's a cheater.

48:36.789 --> 48:40.408
Honestly, if he wasn't who he is, they'd
have found him in a fucking alley.

48:40.459 --> 48:43.378
- Well, he is who he is.
- That's why I called.

48:50.002 --> 48:52.337
You fellows ever hear of sleep?

48:52.371 --> 48:54.305
Who can sleep
with all this excitement?

48:56.175 --> 48:57.759
I heard luck had nothing
a lucky to do with it.

48:58.894 --> 49:01.229
I'm a skilled player
is what he means.

49:01.263 --> 49:04.215
- That's what I hear.
- Mmm, so?

49:04.233 --> 49:05.984
What's all this
about cutting me off?

49:06.018 --> 49:08.570
It's not that.
It's a small house.

49:08.604 --> 49:11.072
We just can't handle your kind
of action right now.

49:11.106 --> 49:13.491
Your credit's good with me.

49:14.777 --> 49:16.744
Why don't we get to know
each other better?

49:16.779 --> 49:18.413
I don't think I like
what I'm hearing.

49:18.447 --> 49:20.999
Maybe you shouldn't be listening
to the grown-ups' conversations.

49:21.033 --> 49:23.034
- How is that?
- Charlie, sit down.

49:23.068 --> 49:25.236
Charlie... Charlie.

49:36.081 --> 49:38.433
As of now, you owe me...

49:38.467 --> 49:41.186
well, 93 grand.

49:41.220 --> 49:45.473
Less 60 for tonight's load
knocks it to 33.

49:45.524 --> 49:47.592
So you could keep playing then.

49:47.610 --> 49:49.611
I don't gamble where
I don't feel welcome.

49:49.645 --> 49:52.564
I'm sorry you feel that way.

49:52.598 --> 49:54.282
Cash him out.

49:58.604 --> 50:00.705
Thompson, right?

50:01.924 --> 50:04.609
I heard you're familiar
with my wife.

50:06.245 --> 50:08.613
- Pardon?
- My wife.

50:08.631 --> 50:11.499
Margaret...
you drove her home.

50:14.286 --> 50:17.055
- Where'd you get that money?
- What business is that of yours?

50:17.089 --> 50:18.840
That money belongs
to your wife.

50:18.874 --> 50:20.975
Oh, so it was you
who give it to her.

50:21.010 --> 50:24.012
Here, you prick. I'm winning anyway.

50:24.063 --> 50:27.315
Hey hey!

50:27.349 --> 50:29.767
Toss him the fuck out.

50:36.808 --> 50:38.976
All right, we went over
the rules in the locker room.

50:38.994 --> 50:41.362
I want a good clean fight.
No holding, no low blows,

50:41.413 --> 50:44.115
break when I tell you.
Now touch gloves and come out fighting.

51:00.499 --> 51:03.167
Hit him!
Fucking hit him.

51:03.185 --> 51:06.354
Keep your right up.
Hook, jab jab jab.

51:13.362 --> 51:16.180
If I was you I'd bet
on the little guy.

51:16.198 --> 51:19.450
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a fight fan.

51:19.485 --> 51:22.236
What else?

51:27.576 --> 51:29.911
So how much you know
about this haul

51:29.962 --> 51:33.047
that's coming in tonight
for Rothstein?

51:38.037 --> 51:41.872
I tell you, for a fellow good-looking
as me, I sure do get the homely girls.

51:41.890 --> 51:43.890
I don't mind the homely ones,

51:44.342 --> 51:47.227
especially when they're dumb.
I love the dumb ones.

51:47.262 --> 51:49.479
My girl is so dumb,

51:49.514 --> 51:51.881
she thought that daylight
savings was a bank.

51:53.651 --> 51:55.051
My girl is so dumb, she thinks

51:55.069 --> 51:57.688
long island sound
makes a noise.

51:57.722 --> 51:59.773
It's true!
Thank you, thank you.

51:59.824 --> 52:02.726
That worked better than this afternoon.
You're a wonderful crowd.

52:02.744 --> 52:04.194
My girl is so so dumb,

52:04.228 --> 52:06.663
she thought that iceberg
was a Yiddishe name.

52:08.700 --> 52:11.618
My girl is so dumb, she tried to
buy plum pudding from a plumber.

52:11.669 --> 52:14.421
- All right, let's go.
- No, it's true.

52:14.455 --> 52:16.924
Had him running all over town.
Something else about my girl,

52:16.958 --> 52:19.426
she was so dumb, they finally had
to burn down the schoolhouse

52:19.460 --> 52:21.712
to get her out
of the second grade.

52:21.746 --> 52:24.464
They let her pose
for the class photo,

52:24.515 --> 52:26.800
but oh boy, was she homely.

52:26.851 --> 52:28.752
You've heard
of crocodile shoes?

52:28.770 --> 52:31.438
Well, she had a pair...
with a complexion to match!

52:31.472 --> 52:33.690
I took her to visit the zoo.

52:33.725 --> 52:36.777
Why, the zookeeper thanked me
for bringing her back.

52:36.811 --> 52:38.695
Lovely family though...
very nice girl.

52:38.730 --> 52:41.648
Lovely family. Her poor father
died of throat trouble...

52:41.699 --> 52:43.984
they hung him.

52:45.570 --> 52:48.104
Her poor brother, lovely
chap, but he's gone too.

52:48.122 --> 52:51.642
With good behavior, he should
be back in about 10 years.

52:51.676 --> 52:55.445
He used to work in a bank, but no
matter how much the boss likes you,

52:55.463 --> 52:58.882
you can't work in a bank
and take home samples.

52:58.916 --> 53:00.167
Oh no!

53:00.218 --> 53:02.118
Pretty fucking obvious
now, ain't it?

53:05.974 --> 53:07.808
- Okay!
- Get their guns.

53:07.842 --> 53:11.228
You're fucking dead.
You're fucking as good as dead!

53:11.262 --> 53:12.813
- All of youse!
- Shut your yap.

53:12.847 --> 53:15.098
Easy easy, don't get rattled.

53:22.973 --> 53:24.691
What's that?

53:24.742 --> 53:26.243
What?

53:26.277 --> 53:28.862
That!

53:28.913 --> 53:31.164
The fucking wind.
Relax.

53:53.604 --> 53:56.106
The woods...
get him, get him!

53:56.140 --> 53:58.558
Come here, you son of a bitch!

54:38.149 --> 54:40.267
What the?

54:54.031 --> 54:56.366
Darmody!
Jimmy!

54:58.035 --> 54:59.503
- Did you get him?
- Yeah.

54:59.537 --> 55:01.838
- What the fuck was that?
- The fucking deers.

55:03.073 --> 55:05.459
Go on, get in the car.
Go on, scram!

55:08.245 --> 55:10.380
Come on, let's go.
Beat it.

55:18.473 --> 55:21.090
The court is now open.

55:21.109 --> 55:24.478
Â¶ well, good
morning, judge... Â¶

55:24.529 --> 55:27.931
Got something to say now, huh?

55:27.949 --> 55:29.816
Â¶ I said
good morning, jury... Â¶

55:29.867 --> 55:31.902
fucking whore!

55:31.936 --> 55:36.239
Â¶ I see you know my face, mmmmm,
mistaken surely... Â¶

55:36.273 --> 55:38.792
- Please stop!
- Â¶ When I see that sign Â¶

55:38.826 --> 55:41.745
Â¶ lord have mercy on my soul... Â¶

55:41.779 --> 55:45.582
Â¶ I couldn't budge, I hope to choke... Â¶

55:45.616 --> 55:49.669
Â¶ It was all a joke,
I said good morning, judge Â¶

55:49.720 --> 55:52.973
Â¶ you heard me,
good morning, judge... Â¶

55:53.007 --> 55:54.724
Good morning, Sophie.

55:54.759 --> 55:57.761
- Â¶ Good morning, jury... Â¶
- Good morning.

55:57.795 --> 56:00.347
When I see that,

56:00.398 --> 56:01.965
what that just said,

56:01.983 --> 56:04.935
I can surely say...

56:04.969 --> 56:07.303
Â¶ Oh lord Â¶

56:07.321 --> 56:11.491
Â¶ lawd-a-mercy. Â¶

56:25.423 --> 56:27.707
I would love to get
married one day.

56:27.758 --> 56:31.428
I am very very sorry.
Excuse me

56:31.462 --> 56:33.096
for one moment.

56:33.130 --> 56:35.331
- He is always talking on the phone.
- Hello.

56:35.349 --> 56:37.133
- It's me.
- What?

56:37.167 --> 56:40.604
It's me.
We got a problem.

56:44.675 --> 56:47.677
All right, I'll be right there.

56:48.946 --> 56:51.982
Fellas, fellas,
no leads or arrests.

56:52.016 --> 56:55.402
- How many bodies were found?
- Nothing has been confirmed at this time.

56:55.453 --> 56:58.371
As soon as we know something,
we'll make an official statement.

56:58.406 --> 57:00.874
Four bodies, blood everywhere.

57:00.908 --> 57:02.909
It was like a fucking
firing squad.

57:02.960 --> 57:04.911
No sign of the truck?

57:06.414 --> 57:08.865
In a goddamned election year.

57:10.751 --> 57:12.886
- The feds onto this yet?
- No.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.138
Hands still full
at the funeral home.

57:16.340 --> 57:18.675
Cusick's probably
having a stroke.

57:18.709 --> 57:21.478
You know the imbecile
changed his name to Doyle?

57:22.730 --> 57:24.598
Don't ask.

57:27.551 --> 57:29.936
You know, the peculiar thing is

57:29.987 --> 57:33.323
that at the same time
the feds are raiding Mickey,

57:33.357 --> 57:35.158
this shit

57:35.192 --> 57:37.160
is happening three miles away.

57:37.194 --> 57:39.412
Ain't that a coincidence?

57:43.167 --> 57:45.234
So do you want
to say it or should I?

57:47.237 --> 57:50.173
It could be Rothstein
himself set it up.

57:52.910 --> 57:55.178
All right, so who knew
about the load?

58:01.519 --> 58:03.353
Jimmy?

58:06.057 --> 58:09.109
Who's mysteriously gone
missing all of a sudden.

58:12.063 --> 58:14.097
All right, bring him in.

58:24.576 --> 58:26.776
Hey, Ange, I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

58:26.794 --> 58:28.462
Uh, Jimmy in?

58:28.496 --> 58:30.581
No, I haven't seen him
in hours.

58:30.615 --> 58:32.416
I thought he was at work.

58:32.450 --> 58:34.668
Sorry to disturb you.
When he comes home,

58:34.719 --> 58:36.587
tell him Nucky's
looking for him.

58:37.955 --> 58:39.890
Well, now I'm getting
concerned.

58:39.924 --> 58:43.477
Probably ran into a friend...
war buddy maybe.

58:43.511 --> 58:45.429
Do you think it could
have something

58:45.463 --> 58:47.431
to do with the men
that picked him up?

58:47.465 --> 58:49.783
Beg your pardon?

58:52.620 --> 58:54.304
There is no comment.

58:54.322 --> 58:56.073
Now you must stop ringing!

58:56.107 --> 58:58.275
Cocksucking reporters.

58:59.994 --> 59:02.279
If they want a statement,
tell them to call the Mayor.

59:02.313 --> 59:03.947
Even reporters
ain't that stupid.

59:03.981 --> 59:05.532
I'll give them
a statement later.

59:05.583 --> 59:07.501
I can't get over it.
It don't make sense.

59:07.535 --> 59:09.819
- Doesn't it?
- Come on, Eli... Jimmy?

59:09.837 --> 59:11.705
He gives the feds
the funeral home...

59:11.756 --> 59:13.874
...Throws them off the scent.

59:13.925 --> 59:15.876
Meantime he's out
pulling this job.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.545
- Not how, why.
- Why? Because he's greedy.

59:18.596 --> 59:21.998
Jealous probably too.
That's the way people are, Nucky.

59:23.718 --> 59:25.686
Arnold Rothstein.

59:26.971 --> 59:30.107
I'm very sorry, Mr.
Thompson is not available.

59:33.194 --> 59:35.696
He would very much like you
to call him back.

59:40.952 --> 59:42.986
- Where are you going?
- To get some air.

59:47.208 --> 59:49.376
Mr. Thompson, I was just
coming to see you.

59:49.410 --> 59:51.128
I'm sorry, I'm late
for a meeting.

59:51.162 --> 59:53.163
I really just wanted
to drop this off.

59:53.197 --> 59:55.382
I'm on my way to the hospital.

59:55.416 --> 59:58.302
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- One of our members...

59:58.336 --> 01:00:01.336
Mrs. Schroeder.
She suffered an injury.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.120
Lost her child.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:12.074
What was the manner of injury?

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.579
I'm really not
at liberty to say.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.834
Â¶ Into the dark oblivion where
there ain't no use a'living Â¶

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:25.638
Â¶ then you can lay me
low down in the ground Â¶

01:00:25.672 --> 01:00:27.372
Â¶ where not a soul
can get around Â¶

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:31.210
Â¶ take away my cake,
take away my pie Â¶

01:00:26.692 --> 01:00:30.311
Â¶ take away my taste and even
take away my eyeball Â¶

01:00:30.345 --> 01:00:31.562
Â¶ but lordy Â¶

01:00:31.613 --> 01:00:33.013
Â¶ but lordy, Mr. man Â¶

01:00:33.031 --> 01:00:36.951
Â¶ now don't you take away
those blues. Â¶

01:00:38.853 --> 01:00:40.454
Commodore?

01:00:40.489 --> 01:00:42.573
Mr. Nucky here
to see you.

01:00:45.744 --> 01:00:49.046
Well, send him in,
for God's sake.

01:00:54.169 --> 01:00:57.805
Quite the shitstorm you got on
your hands, eh, Mr. Treasurer?

01:00:57.839 --> 01:01:00.007
Well, good morning to you too.

01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:02.009
These bodies in the woods

01:01:02.043 --> 01:01:04.929
I assume belong to your
friend in New York?

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.981
Rothstein's men.

01:01:07.015 --> 01:01:09.333
I don't understand
why you got involved.

01:01:09.368 --> 01:01:11.986
Yes you do!

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.988
It was a favor to Chicago.

01:01:14.022 --> 01:01:16.190
That plus Rothstein's
numbers were right.

01:01:16.224 --> 01:01:18.109
Till he buggered you
in the ass.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.945
Fucking Rothstein.

01:01:22.664 --> 01:01:25.065
By Henry fucking Ford.

01:01:30.505 --> 01:01:33.874
Oh, I think my problems
go beyond world finance.

01:01:34.872 --> 01:01:37.474
What a fucking night.

01:01:44.049 --> 01:01:46.067
It's seven years today.

01:01:49.154 --> 01:01:51.072
- Mabel.
- Oh.

01:01:53.525 --> 01:01:54.725
I'd just gone to jail.

01:01:57.838 --> 01:01:59.905
Not a day goes by,
I'll tell you that much.

01:01:59.923 --> 01:02:02.809
Well, maybe she's better off.

01:02:06.964 --> 01:02:08.914
The feds will be
all over this thing.

01:02:08.932 --> 01:02:11.801
I can't have dead bodies lying around
on the road... bad for business.

01:02:11.852 --> 01:02:13.853
Well, you gotta
give them someone.

01:02:13.887 --> 01:02:16.305
Let 'em make an arrest.

01:02:18.692 --> 01:02:20.926
It's Jimmy.

01:02:20.944 --> 01:02:22.779
Get the fuck... This?!

01:02:24.097 --> 01:02:25.314
Left me holding the bag.

01:02:25.365 --> 01:02:27.533
What a fucking little prick.

01:02:27.568 --> 01:02:30.620
I never knew he had it in him.

01:02:30.654 --> 01:02:32.989
Jimmy?

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.794
Eh, fucking Jimmy.

01:02:40.178 --> 01:02:41.712
Nucky.

01:02:41.746 --> 01:02:44.414
Nuck!

01:02:46.467 --> 01:02:49.052
- I take you back. I give you a job...
- Nucky, listen...

01:02:49.086 --> 01:02:50.754
...and this is how you
fucking repay me?!

01:02:50.772 --> 01:02:52.773
Last night was not supposed
to happen like that, Nuck.

01:02:52.807 --> 01:02:55.192
Make sure you mention that to Rothstein
as he's cutting your nuts off.

01:02:55.226 --> 01:02:57.144
That's all gonna get
straightened out, I promise.

01:02:57.195 --> 01:02:58.928
Are you that stupid?

01:02:58.946 --> 01:03:01.314
Have no fucking idea how
in over your head you are?

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:04.151
- I know it's awful...
- Did I not tell you to slow down?!

01:03:04.202 --> 01:03:05.569
I tried to give you money.
I tried...

01:03:05.603 --> 01:03:07.788
I tried to tell you
I'm not a kid anymore!

01:03:09.107 --> 01:03:11.359
And killing
and fucking larceny?

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:14.578
- That makes you a man?
- No.

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.098
You got brains, kid.

01:03:18.132 --> 01:03:20.300
You had a future.

01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:22.919
Look, I still got a future...
we both do.

01:03:24.722 --> 01:03:28.025
The war, Nuck,
the things I did over there?

01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:31.428
You live in a trench
for months on end.

01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:34.431
The killing,
the smell of death...

01:03:34.449 --> 01:03:36.933
Nucky, I'm nothing
but a murderer.

01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:39.870
You know how many times
I went over the top?

01:03:39.904 --> 01:03:42.122
They called me a fucking hero.
The truth is

01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:44.774
I didn't care anymore.

01:03:44.806 --> 01:03:46.841
I didn't care.

01:03:48.727 --> 01:03:50.294
You're home now.

01:03:50.312 --> 01:03:52.513
- You got a family.
- I'm going to hell, Nuck.

01:03:52.564 --> 01:03:53.898
- Knock it off.
- No, I am.

01:03:53.932 --> 01:03:55.600
- You are not.
- I'm 22 years old.

01:03:55.634 --> 01:03:58.769
I see fellas like fucking Luciano with
a fancy suit with fucking diamonds...

01:03:58.803 --> 01:04:01.188
- is that what you want?
- That's what you want too!

01:04:01.239 --> 01:04:03.741
That's what...
It's what we all want.

01:04:03.775 --> 01:04:06.494
At least I got the gumption
to take it.

01:04:07.946 --> 01:04:10.865
You'd be very foolish
to underestimate me, James.

01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:13.451
I could have you killed.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.204
Yeah, but you won't.

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:24.762
Look, you can't be
half a gangster, Nucky.

01:04:24.796 --> 01:04:26.681
Not anymore.

01:04:29.267 --> 01:04:30.685
Let me help you.

01:04:32.771 --> 01:04:34.055
What the fuck is this?

01:04:34.106 --> 01:04:35.773
It's your share for last night.

01:04:39.478 --> 01:04:41.512
I didn't ask for this.

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:43.714
You didn't have to.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.173
Â¶ And as the night is falling Â¶

01:04:55.207 --> 01:04:57.976
Â¶ I find myself recalling Â¶

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:02.547
Â¶ that blissful
all-enthralling day Â¶

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:06.151
Â¶ I found my love Â¶

01:05:06.185 --> 01:05:09.988
Â¶ in Avalon Â¶

01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:14.859
Â¶ beside the bay Â¶

01:05:14.893 --> 01:05:17.946
Â¶ I left my love Â¶

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.249
Â¶ in Avalon Â¶

01:05:21.283 --> 01:05:26.371
Â¶ and sailed away Â¶

01:05:26.405 --> 01:05:30.125
Â¶ I dream of her Â¶

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.576
Â¶ in Avalon Â¶

01:05:33.345 --> 01:05:38.600
Â¶ from dusk till dawn Â¶

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:41.886
Â¶ and so I think Â¶

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.839
Â¶ I'll travel on Â¶

01:05:44.873 --> 01:05:50.612
Â¶ to Avalon. Â¶

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:29.764
Sir, we need you to
come with us.

01:06:29.782 --> 01:06:31.984
What are you doing?

01:06:33.403 --> 01:06:35.437
- What are you doing?
- Get in there!

01:07:17.342 --> 01:07:19.260
Sir!

01:07:21.647 --> 01:07:23.981
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake.

01:08:08.609 --> 01:08:11.144
- You get the gold?
- Are you kidding me?

01:09:29.845 --> 01:09:32.131
The Atlantic city
sheriff's department has confirmed

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:34.966
that a body found caught in a
fisherman's net this afternoon

01:09:34.984 --> 01:09:38.571
is that of Hans Schroeder, a local man
who went missing yesterday. Stop.

01:09:38.604 --> 01:09:41.023
Schroeder, who worked
occasionally as a baker's helper,

01:09:41.073 --> 01:09:43.158
had been sought in connection
with Saturday night's

01:09:43.193 --> 01:09:45.361
bloody roadside massacre.
Stop.

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:49.832
Maestro, can I have my note, please?
A note for Eddie.

01:09:49.866 --> 01:09:52.167
Â¶ Ahhhh. Â¶

01:09:52.702 --> 01:09:54.453
This time it's a ballad.

01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.158
Â¶ Jonesy used to roam Â¶

01:09:59.176 --> 01:10:00.993
Â¶ never stayed at home Â¶

01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:04.997
Â¶ he'd go out with the boys and
leave his wifey all alone Â¶

01:10:05.015 --> 01:10:09.051
Â¶ then the town went dry,
Jones began to cry Â¶

01:10:09.102 --> 01:10:13.305
Â¶ with no cafes or cabarets
I know I'll surely die Â¶

01:10:13.339 --> 01:10:15.524
Â¶ for weeks
it had him worried Â¶

01:10:16.023 --> 01:10:18.107
Â¶ but now he's feeling gay Â¶

01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:20.141
Â¶ I heard him tell
a friend of his Â¶

01:10:20.319 --> 01:10:22.487
Â¶ out on the street
today, say! Â¶

01:10:22.521 --> 01:10:25.657
Â¶ I never knew
I had a wonderful wife Â¶

01:10:25.691 --> 01:10:29.995
Â¶ until the town went dry Â¶

01:10:30.029 --> 01:10:34.449
Â¶ the way I spent my money
on women was a crime Â¶

01:10:34.483 --> 01:10:36.418
Â¶ I found that with my wife Â¶

01:10:36.452 --> 01:10:39.037
Â¶ I could have had
a better time Â¶

01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:40.922
Â¶ I'd send her to the country Â¶

01:10:40.957 --> 01:10:42.991
Â¶ and I'd always shout hooray Â¶

01:10:43.009 --> 01:10:47.012
Â¶ but I saw her picture in a
bathing suit the other day Â¶

01:10:47.046 --> 01:10:50.548
Â¶ I never knew
I had a wonderful wife Â¶

01:10:50.599 --> 01:10:55.387
Â¶ until the town
went dry. Â¶
