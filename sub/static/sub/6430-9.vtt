00:00.743 --> 00:02.177
Previously
on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:03.211 --> 00:04.378
We haven't met.

00:04.446 --> 00:05.746
I'm Mrs. Frederic.

00:05.814 --> 00:07.114
Warehouse 13...
Is it yours?

00:07.182 --> 00:10.284
It's mine...
And so are Lattimer and Bering.

00:10.352 --> 00:11.585
Excuse me?

00:11.653 --> 00:13.554
Kate Logan,
Chicago Field Office.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.256
I didn't know you
transferred to Chicago.

00:15.324 --> 00:17.625
So, uh, you showing up here

00:17.693 --> 00:20.529
means I should call
you, right?

00:20.473 --> 00:22.708
Call, don't call--
same as always.

00:24.311 --> 00:25.377
Hey...

00:25.445 --> 00:26.712
I'm so sorry
we got cut off earlier.

00:26.780 --> 00:28.314
S-something huge came up.

00:28.381 --> 00:30.649
I don't think it's a good idea
for me to see you anymore.

00:30.717 --> 00:32.750
Turn around and put
your hands in the air!

00:32.819 --> 00:36.021
H.G. Wells.
That's my daughter...

00:36.089 --> 00:37.289
My Christina.

00:37.357 --> 00:39.358
Everything that ever mattered
in my life

00:39.426 --> 00:41.493
is gone now,
except the Warehouse.

00:41.561 --> 00:43.462
I want to come back
and work there again.

00:43.530 --> 00:44.697
Okay, I don't care

00:44.764 --> 00:46.699
if I'm having
a brain transplant.

00:46.766 --> 00:49.034
If you cross paths
with H.G. Wells,

00:49.102 --> 00:51.136
yank me out of anesthesia,
and you fill me in.

00:51.204 --> 00:52.972
Is that understood?

00:53.039 --> 00:55.107
Yes, sir.
Crystal clear.

Aggh!

01:31.344 --> 01:34.446
Agh! Aah!

01:41.421 --> 01:43.155
Stop!

01:43.223 --> 01:45.791
For God's sak--
agh!

02:08.181 --> 02:10.816
I told you
I've got a bad shoulder, okay?

02:10.883 --> 02:12.284
It's an old wrestling injury.

02:12.352 --> 02:13.419
71.

02:13.486 --> 02:17.089
He bowled a 71.

02:17.157 --> 02:19.158
It's amazing to me
that you're single.

02:19.225 --> 02:20.759
Really, so surprising.
It broke.

02:20.827 --> 02:21.894
What? What?
What broke?

02:21.962 --> 02:23.829
She knows.
Just some dumb shelf.

02:23.897 --> 02:25.898
Is there a reason Warehouse
shelves are falling down?

02:25.966 --> 02:28.367
Yes.
We need brackets.

02:28.435 --> 02:29.735
From the hardware store.

02:29.803 --> 02:31.036
Well, I'm usually
pretty good at mysteries.

02:31.104 --> 02:33.305
This one's got me stumped.
Yeah, me too.

02:33.373 --> 02:35.607
Todd works
at the hardware store.

02:35.675 --> 02:37.710
Oh!
Yes, yes.

02:37.777 --> 02:40.813
Todd, the young lad
with the the glasses--

02:40.880 --> 02:42.448
the boyfriend.
Not anymore.

02:42.515 --> 02:43.882
They broke up.

02:43.950 --> 02:45.351
She's trying not to run
into him,

02:45.418 --> 02:46.752
so she won't go
to the hardware store

02:46.820 --> 02:49.054
to get the brackets--
I don't care about Todd.

02:49.122 --> 02:51.156
She doesn't care about Todd.
What a coincidence.

02:51.224 --> 02:53.092
And we've got work to do.

02:53.159 --> 02:55.761
Yes, let's all
grow up a little, shall we?

02:55.829 --> 02:57.796
âª "C" is for cookie âª

02:57.864 --> 02:59.565
âª that's good enough for me âª

02:59.632 --> 03:01.166
Oh, snap!

03:01.234 --> 03:02.468
Kate Logan.

03:02.535 --> 03:03.902
Excuse me.

03:03.970 --> 03:05.237
Yeah.

03:05.305 --> 03:07.006
Just can't get enough
of me, can you?

03:07.073 --> 03:08.741
Well, who can blame you?

03:08.808 --> 03:10.009
What?

03:10.076 --> 03:12.277
Pete, what's wrong?

03:12.345 --> 03:14.079
It's Dickinson.
Somebody--

03:14.147 --> 03:17.483
guys...

03:18.785 --> 03:20.419
We have to go
to Washington, D.C. right now.

03:25.759 --> 03:27.326
Do they know
the cause of death?

03:27.394 --> 03:30.729
Massive internal bleeding
and hypovolemic shock.

03:30.797 --> 03:32.798
This is an X-ray
of Dickinson's hand.

03:32.866 --> 03:34.767
It looks like every bone
has been dislocated.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.735
Yeah, the carpals usually
sit right against the radius,

03:36.803 --> 03:38.237
but there's a half an inch
between them.

03:38.304 --> 03:40.672
Every joint in his body
looks like that,

03:40.740 --> 03:42.341
as if he was pulled apart.

03:42.409 --> 03:44.009
My God.

03:44.077 --> 03:46.078
What the hell
could have done this?

03:46.146 --> 03:48.047
The only word for it
is "freaky."

03:48.114 --> 03:49.681
That's why I called you.

03:49.749 --> 03:51.950
That's what you do, right?
Weird and freaky.

03:52.018 --> 03:53.619
The pain--
it just must have been...

03:53.686 --> 03:55.287
Would you give us a minute?

03:55.355 --> 03:59.458
Right.
Super secret weird and freaky.

03:59.526 --> 04:01.126
I'll be outside.

04:06.232 --> 04:08.333
I just--
I can't believe this.

04:08.401 --> 04:09.334
Why?

04:09.402 --> 04:10.836
I don't care what it takes,

04:10.904 --> 04:12.171
but we are not gonna stop

04:12.238 --> 04:13.906
till we know
who's responsible for this.

04:13.973 --> 04:16.108
Pete...It's me.

04:17.911 --> 04:19.077
This is my fault.

04:59.910 --> 05:01.911
Artie, what do you mean
this is your fault?

05:01.978 --> 05:02.978
How can this be your fault?

05:03.046 --> 05:04.914
Artie, just--
just talk to us.

05:04.981 --> 05:06.515
What did this?

05:06.583 --> 05:07.983
You wouldn't have thought
it was anything--

05:08.051 --> 05:09.685
just an old, rusty chain.

05:09.753 --> 05:11.086
What chain?

05:11.154 --> 05:12.721
The rack

05:12.789 --> 05:14.757
the chain
from Torquemada's rack.

05:14.824 --> 05:17.826
What? Who is
this Torquemada woman?

05:17.894 --> 05:19.562
A different rack
entirely.

05:19.629 --> 05:21.864
Tomas de Torquemada--

05:21.932 --> 05:23.399
the Grand Inquisitor--
he was the driving force

05:23.466 --> 05:24.667
behind the Spanish Inquisition.

05:24.734 --> 05:27.036
If the holder
pulls the chain taut

05:27.103 --> 05:29.638
and focuses his energy
on the victim,

05:29.706 --> 05:33.943
then it induces the same kind
of bone-wrenching agony...

05:34.010 --> 05:35.244
That was suffered
on the rack.

05:35.312 --> 05:37.746
That's why Dickinson's bones
were all...

05:37.814 --> 05:40.449
Twisted and wrenched
from their sockets.

05:40.517 --> 05:43.185
I'm sorry.

05:43.253 --> 05:44.720
I'm so, so sorry.

05:44.788 --> 05:46.355
Artie,
I just don't understand.

05:46.423 --> 05:48.557
How is this your fault?

05:48.625 --> 05:50.759
Well...

05:50.827 --> 05:53.963
In the '70s, I had some dealings
with the Soviet Union.

05:54.030 --> 05:55.531
No, no, no.
Artie, we know all that.

05:55.599 --> 05:57.700
Okay, pre-Warehouse,
you worked for the NSA.

05:57.767 --> 05:58.968
You traded secrets
to the Russians.

05:59.035 --> 06:01.003
They were gonna charge you
with treason.

06:01.071 --> 06:02.304
But Mrs. Frederic fixed it.

06:02.372 --> 06:05.174
You didn't trade secrets...

06:05.241 --> 06:08.344
Did you?

06:08.411 --> 06:09.645
Artifacts?

06:09.713 --> 06:11.313
Just trinkets.

06:11.381 --> 06:13.315
I thought
that they were antiques,

06:13.383 --> 06:16.952
old relics that the Soviets
were willing to trade for.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.821
What, wait, trade--
trade what--money?

06:18.888 --> 06:20.689
No.

06:20.757 --> 06:22.291
People--

06:22.359 --> 06:25.928
political prisoners
rotting in the Gulags.

06:25.996 --> 06:29.264
You traded artifacts...
For people?

06:29.332 --> 06:30.866
It was
a different world, Myka.

06:30.934 --> 06:32.801
Berlin Wall...

06:32.869 --> 06:35.504
Nuclear stockpiling,
persecution of Soviet Jews.

06:35.572 --> 06:38.807
What was a rusty old chain
compared to a human life?

06:38.875 --> 06:40.909
I didn't know
it was an artifact.

06:40.977 --> 06:43.112
Hey, man...

06:43.179 --> 06:45.014
I'd have done
the same thing.

06:45.081 --> 06:49.051
And then, one day,
my Russian contact let slip

06:49.119 --> 06:52.988
that these old trinkets...

06:53.056 --> 06:54.523
Had power.

06:54.591 --> 06:57.726
And pretty soon, I discovered
that many of these things

06:57.794 --> 07:00.629
had frightening,
dangerous power

07:00.697 --> 07:02.131
and I couldn't live
with the guilt, so I--

07:02.198 --> 07:03.499
so you turned yourself in.

07:03.566 --> 07:05.434
And that was the day
Mrs. Frederic came into my life.

07:05.502 --> 07:06.735
She made me an offer,

07:06.803 --> 07:08.804
a chance to make amends
for past mistakes.

07:08.872 --> 07:10.773
That's why she gave you
a new name.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.274
Arthur Weisfelt
died that day,

07:12.342 --> 07:14.610
and Artie Nielsen was born.

07:14.678 --> 07:16.045
Look, that's a hell
of a story, Artie,

07:16.112 --> 07:17.913
but what's it got to do
with Dickinson?

07:17.981 --> 07:19.381
Why him?

07:19.449 --> 07:20.582
I don't know.

07:20.650 --> 07:23.185
But we are gonna find out.

07:23.253 --> 07:24.887
...Glory are yours,

07:24.954 --> 07:27.089
forever and ever.

07:27.157 --> 07:28.090
Amen.

07:28.158 --> 07:29.458
Amen.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.063
I'm just gonna take a walk.

07:34.130 --> 07:36.598
Okay.

07:39.536 --> 07:41.437
Is she okay?

07:41.504 --> 07:43.839
As okay as you can be
at a friend's funeral.

07:49.412 --> 07:53.682
It's a bloody rotten
business.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.118
What are you doing here?

07:56.186 --> 08:00.089
Same as you--
tracking Torquemada's chain.

08:00.156 --> 08:02.558
It was on our most-desired list
in Warehouse 12.

08:02.625 --> 08:03.926
Well, you know what?

08:03.993 --> 08:06.729
You are actually
on Artie's most-desired list.

08:06.796 --> 08:08.630
So unless you want
to be bronzed again--

08:08.698 --> 08:11.366
he's still opposed
to my returning as an Agent?

08:11.434 --> 08:13.802
Well, he's opposed
to your existence.

08:13.870 --> 08:15.637
So, yeah, I would
say that extends to you--

08:15.705 --> 08:17.372
this is absurd.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.908
I saved your life.
I saved Claudia's life.

08:19.976 --> 08:22.745
I've--I've proven
I can be trusted.

08:22.812 --> 08:25.247
More than not, I've proven
that I'm of value.

08:25.315 --> 08:28.250
I'm not questioning
your value.

08:28.318 --> 08:30.018
I'm curious
about your motives.

08:30.086 --> 08:33.322
Myka, I can't.

08:33.389 --> 08:36.525
I don't belong
in this world.

08:36.592 --> 08:37.592
The Warehouse is--

08:37.659 --> 08:39.227
I'm gonna need
more than that.

08:39.294 --> 08:41.063
I'm gonna need more than...

08:41.131 --> 08:43.232
"She doesn't like the world."

08:43.299 --> 08:45.434
I need the truth.

08:45.502 --> 08:47.870
Why did they bronze you?

08:47.937 --> 08:51.340
What--what did you do
that the Regents felt

08:51.407 --> 08:53.242
that they had
to encase you in--

08:53.309 --> 08:56.578
I asked to be bronzed.

08:56.646 --> 08:58.046
You asked?

08:58.114 --> 08:59.314
You...

08:59.382 --> 09:01.884
Who in their right mind
would--

09:01.951 --> 09:05.654
I wasn't in my right mind.

09:08.424 --> 09:12.427
My daughter, my Christina,
had been murdered--

09:12.495 --> 09:15.931
a senseless crime,
brutal and senseless.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.432
I had to try to...

09:17.500 --> 09:20.335
To change it.

09:20.403 --> 09:23.672
And I was working in a place
where miracles happen.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.974
There had to be something,

09:26.042 --> 09:28.744
some way to bring her back

09:28.812 --> 09:30.579
or to turn back time.

09:30.647 --> 09:33.182
I spent years
desperately combing the shelves

09:33.249 --> 09:35.784
of Warehouse 12.

09:35.852 --> 09:38.954
Twice I was discovered
and brought before the Regents.

09:39.022 --> 09:40.789
Twice they were lenient
and gave me a reprieve.

09:40.857 --> 09:44.293
The third time...

09:44.360 --> 09:48.931
My recklessness cost the life
of a fellow Agent.

09:48.998 --> 09:52.734
I was distraught
and quite mad, I'm afraid.

09:52.802 --> 09:55.704
I had become a danger.

09:55.772 --> 09:59.441
So I asked,
and they said yes.

09:59.509 --> 10:03.412
I suppose I hoped to awaken
in a different world,

10:03.479 --> 10:06.648
a better one.

10:06.716 --> 10:10.252
The bronzer
was your time machine.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.387
Closest I could come.

10:22.432 --> 10:24.633
I'll talk to Artie.

10:24.701 --> 10:26.602
Thank you.

10:26.669 --> 10:30.672
Um, this is how to reach me
in D.C.

10:36.346 --> 10:38.380
Myka...

10:38.448 --> 10:41.049
I'm sorry about your friend.

10:45.922 --> 10:48.924
Ah, we sure missed you
when you left the NSA.

10:48.992 --> 10:50.459
Beauty <i>and</i> brains.

10:50.526 --> 10:52.494
Thanks, Joe.

10:52.562 --> 10:54.596
Oh, it turns out
that I found my calling.

10:54.664 --> 10:56.298
Oh, do I want
to know what that means?

10:56.366 --> 10:58.166
No, no.
Never mind. I don't.

10:58.234 --> 11:01.069
As long as you love
what you're doing, right?

11:01.137 --> 11:02.104
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:02.171 --> 11:03.872
Right.

11:06.976 --> 11:09.645
Uh, thanks,
but I'm really not hungry.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.046
I made tuna melts.

11:11.114 --> 11:13.582
Tuna melts?
Okay, you buried the lead.

11:13.650 --> 11:16.184
I'm standing
in front of a dead woman.

11:16.252 --> 11:18.153
You two have to live
in the same town.

11:18.221 --> 11:19.821
Work it out.

11:19.889 --> 11:22.190
I'll go get
some lemonade.

11:25.061 --> 11:27.663
If Claudia won't come
to the hardware store...

11:27.730 --> 11:29.164
The hardware store
will come to Claudia?

11:29.232 --> 11:30.065
Cute.

11:34.470 --> 11:36.138
Ooh, brackets.

11:36.205 --> 11:38.440
You shouldn't have.

11:38.508 --> 11:41.410
Yeah, so...

11:41.477 --> 11:44.446
So...

11:44.514 --> 11:46.148
How's life? Good?

11:46.215 --> 11:48.183
If by "good" you mean
excruciatingly boring,

11:48.251 --> 11:49.584
then, yeah, my life's good.

11:49.652 --> 11:52.688
Yeah, mine's really good.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.856
I've been thinking
about you.

11:54.924 --> 11:56.625
Ironic--
you broke up with me.

11:56.693 --> 11:57.926
I know.

11:57.994 --> 11:59.528
I guess I just didn't think

11:59.595 --> 12:00.929
you'd cut out of my life
completely.

12:00.997 --> 12:02.864
I can do black.
I can do white.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.900
Not so good with gray.

12:04.968 --> 12:06.668
You mix black paint
with white paint.

12:06.736 --> 12:08.570
You've got to get
out of that hardware store,

12:08.638 --> 12:10.172
at least to find
some new metaphors.

12:10.239 --> 12:12.607
So does that mean
we could maybe be friends?

12:12.675 --> 12:15.110
Friends...

12:15.178 --> 12:16.545
Sounds grayish.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.447
The thing is, Claudia...

12:25.488 --> 12:27.022
I got to go.

12:27.090 --> 12:29.291
I'm--I'm sorry, I--
you're leaving?

12:29.359 --> 12:30.993
I-I'll call you later,
I promise.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.195
I'm--I'm really sorry.
I-I promise I-I'll call you.

12:35.331 --> 12:36.665
What happened?

12:36.733 --> 12:38.900
I have no frakkin' idea.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.503
Dude was here, got a text,
dude is gone.

12:41.571 --> 12:44.506
Well, men are generally out
of touch with their emotions.

12:44.574 --> 12:47.009
I mean, look at Pete and Artie.
Those are my choices?

12:47.076 --> 12:48.577
They say one thing,
and they do another,

12:48.644 --> 12:50.579
because they're not exactly
sure how they feel.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.714
Mixed signals cover
all possibilities.

12:52.782 --> 12:54.182
Exactly.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.585
How am I supposed to respond
to that, Leena,

12:56.652 --> 12:58.353
with a big smile
or with gunfire?

12:58.421 --> 13:00.989
With patience.
Give him time.

13:01.057 --> 13:02.357
Patience?

13:02.425 --> 13:03.492
Right.

13:03.559 --> 13:06.962
Oh, no, I can be patient.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.498
Actually, no, I can't.

13:20.443 --> 13:21.877
Sanchez, are you back
from lunch already?

13:21.944 --> 13:23.945
Could you--
who are you?

13:24.013 --> 13:26.448
How did you get in here?

13:32.255 --> 13:33.655
Uhh!

13:52.108 --> 13:53.708
Artie...

13:53.776 --> 13:55.010
Pete's just looking
through the rest

13:55.078 --> 13:56.578
of the security-camera footage.

13:56.646 --> 13:59.414
This is where you found him?
It was quick and quiet.

13:59.482 --> 14:01.783
People in the other offices
didn't hear a thing.

14:01.851 --> 14:04.252
Artie, it--
it's 70 degrees here,

14:04.320 --> 14:07.322
but--but the prelim says
that he died of hypothermia.

14:07.390 --> 14:10.525
Did--did the chain also...?

14:10.593 --> 14:11.860
The <i>Titanic.</i>

14:11.928 --> 14:13.895
There was a piece
of driftwood.

14:13.963 --> 14:15.831
It was pried from the arms
of one of the victims.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.633
It became imbued with...

14:18.701 --> 14:21.636
Certain properties.
Another one you traded?

14:21.704 --> 14:24.339
The coincidence
doesn't escape me either.

14:24.407 --> 14:26.908
If someone wanted Joe dead,

14:26.976 --> 14:29.611
then NSA headquarters
is not the easiest place

14:29.679 --> 14:31.246
to take him out.

14:31.314 --> 14:34.483
I think whatever
they were after was right here.

14:34.550 --> 14:37.119
And I want to know what.

14:37.186 --> 14:38.420
You're never gonna get in.

14:38.488 --> 14:39.788
The NSA's system
is so much tighter than ours--

14:39.856 --> 14:41.156
I'm in.

14:41.224 --> 14:42.958
I'm surprised
it took you that long.

14:44.594 --> 14:47.729
Maybe I shouldn't be here
while you hack NSA files.

14:47.797 --> 14:49.865
Well, the mainframe
was not accessed,

14:49.932 --> 14:52.300
so whatever
they were looking for

14:52.368 --> 14:55.470
was only in this computer...

14:55.538 --> 14:56.571
Here.

14:56.639 --> 15:00.475
And the last file
accessed was...

15:00.543 --> 15:04.246
It's just a list
of Russian names and addresses.

15:04.313 --> 15:06.481
What?

15:09.252 --> 15:11.319
Artie, what's the connection?

15:11.387 --> 15:13.088
Me.

15:13.156 --> 15:15.924
These are names of people that
I got released from the Gulag.

15:15.992 --> 15:18.093
It's a list of my relatives.

15:21.364 --> 15:22.898
These people
are your family?

15:26.135 --> 15:29.804
Hey, guys, so I went through
the internal security feed.

15:29.872 --> 15:32.641
There's something
you're gonna want to see.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.709
Okay, wait, wait,

15:34.777 --> 15:36.645
wait, wait,
wait, right there.

15:46.770 --> 15:49.205
H.G. Wells--
what is she doing now?

15:49.273 --> 15:50.540
And why is she coming
after me?

15:50.607 --> 15:51.774
Look, maybe she was here
for other reasons.

15:51.842 --> 15:53.176
Like what?
Applying for a job?

15:53.243 --> 15:55.445
No, like hunting down
whatever artifact that did this,

15:55.512 --> 15:57.780
so she can prove herself
and rejoin the Warehouse.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.920
Myka, how do you know that?

16:03.987 --> 16:05.955
I...

16:06.023 --> 16:07.357
May have...

16:07.424 --> 16:09.092
Spoken to her.

16:09.159 --> 16:11.461
Oh, man!

16:11.528 --> 16:13.830
You've been talking to H.G.?
Let me understand this.

16:13.897 --> 16:16.332
You spoke to H.G. Wells

16:16.400 --> 16:20.036
about official
Warehouse 13 matters,

16:20.104 --> 16:23.639
and you didn't tell me?

16:23.707 --> 16:26.042
I was waiting
for the right time.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.810
This ain't it.
You, of all people--

16:27.878 --> 16:29.946
you accuse me
of keeping secrets,

16:30.013 --> 16:31.814
and then you go
and do something like this?

16:31.882 --> 16:33.216
Hey, hey, hey.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.051
No, hey.
You know what, Artie?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.120
No, no, no.
This is good.

16:37.187 --> 16:41.023
This is good,
because, uh, now we have a lead.

16:41.091 --> 16:43.092
And--and we know
that H.G. is involved,

16:43.160 --> 16:44.494
and all we have to do
is find her,

16:44.561 --> 16:47.463
and--and thank God that Myka
is so good at that.

16:47.531 --> 16:50.500
I know where she is--
the, um, Archer Hotel.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.240
I guess we're going.
Yeah.

17:01.178 --> 17:03.446
All right.

17:03.514 --> 17:05.047
All right, Claude,
you can do this.

17:05.115 --> 17:06.115
Just walk up to him and say--

17:06.183 --> 17:08.151
dah hah hah.

17:10.788 --> 17:12.722
And I'm officially
stalking him. Okay.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.127
Well, who's the girl?

17:18.194 --> 17:19.595
Her name's Claudia.
Claudia?

17:19.663 --> 17:20.663
Yeah.
What does she do?

17:20.731 --> 17:22.064
She just works
at a Warehouse.

17:22.132 --> 17:24.666
That's all you know?
An I.R.S. Warehouse.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.606
Zoinks!

17:58.435 --> 18:00.236
Ah, took you long enough.

18:00.304 --> 18:02.972
Finally looked at the envelope,
did you?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.007
Torquemada's chain--
where is it?

18:05.075 --> 18:07.176
Well, I don't have it.

18:07.244 --> 18:10.847
I've been looking for it
since 1894.

18:10.914 --> 18:13.182
I'm trying to help you, Artie.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.084
How do we know
you didn't kill Dickinson

18:15.152 --> 18:16.619
or Joe Sweetwood?

18:16.687 --> 18:18.054
What possible reason
would have?

18:18.121 --> 18:19.522
Hadn't you rather be looking
for the person

18:19.590 --> 18:23.059
who was photographing Artie
at Dickinson's funeral?

18:23.126 --> 18:24.460
Photographing me?

18:24.528 --> 18:25.795
I followed him,

18:25.863 --> 18:27.497
but by the time
I got inside the NSA,

18:27.564 --> 18:29.065
it was too late.

18:29.132 --> 18:31.601
He left something
on Mr. Sweetwood's body.

18:31.668 --> 18:34.136
I imagine it has
significance to you.

18:34.204 --> 18:37.507
What?
What was it?

18:37.574 --> 18:40.209
I'm more than happy
to share my information,

18:40.277 --> 18:42.712
but I expect
a little quid pro quo.

18:42.779 --> 18:44.380
Nothing.

18:44.448 --> 18:46.916
I tell you nothing.

18:46.984 --> 18:49.318
Right.

18:49.386 --> 18:51.120
Good luck, then.

18:51.188 --> 18:53.189
Artie, wait.
Maybe she has some information--

18:53.257 --> 18:55.791
no, she is a killer, and she
belongs in the bronze sector.

18:55.859 --> 18:57.260
You don't know that!
And I will not be blackmailed!

18:57.327 --> 19:00.830
It's a lead.
Artie, we need leads.

19:02.366 --> 19:03.699
All right.

19:07.304 --> 19:08.971
What is it?

19:09.039 --> 19:11.541
In the bible
on the nightstand.

19:16.680 --> 19:17.980
What does it mean?

19:18.048 --> 19:20.383
Alexander...

19:20.450 --> 19:22.184
He's calling me out.

19:22.252 --> 19:23.586
Who?

19:23.654 --> 19:25.121
It's my Soviet contact.

19:25.188 --> 19:27.790
Whenever he wanted to meet,
he would leave a King of Hearts.

19:27.858 --> 19:29.425
But I thought
he was in prison.

19:29.493 --> 19:31.594
Yeah, well,
looks like he's out...

19:31.662 --> 19:33.462
And obviously not
for good behavior.

19:33.530 --> 19:35.097
He went after Dickinson,

19:35.165 --> 19:36.966
because Dickinson knew
that Arthur Weisfelt

19:37.034 --> 19:39.702
had become Artie Nielsen.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.437
By killing Joe,

19:41.505 --> 19:43.873
this guy gets the list
of all your relatives in Russia.

19:43.941 --> 19:47.910
He's going
after your family.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.346
That's all the quid pro quo
you're gonna get.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.450
This guy must want you
to know what he's doing.

19:54.518 --> 19:55.685
But why?

19:55.752 --> 19:58.020
Artie, why was Alexander
sent to prison?

19:58.088 --> 19:59.221
When I turned myself in,

19:59.289 --> 20:00.456
he became useless to his
government.

20:00.524 --> 20:02.224
He was a liability.

20:02.292 --> 20:05.695
By the time
I found that out...

20:05.762 --> 20:07.563
It was too late.

20:07.631 --> 20:10.166
So, revenge?

20:10.233 --> 20:11.867
I have to get to Moscow.

20:11.935 --> 20:14.003
No, Artie,
that's exactly what he wants.

20:14.071 --> 20:15.538
He's coming after my family.

20:15.606 --> 20:17.406
We're going too.
It's too dangerous.

20:17.474 --> 20:19.575
Oh, don't even bother.

20:42.933 --> 20:46.135
âª âª

20:46.203 --> 20:47.903
Weisfelt instruments.

20:47.971 --> 20:49.205
Yeah.

20:49.272 --> 20:51.574
It's quite
the family resemblance.

20:51.642 --> 20:55.478
And he teaches music,
just like my father.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.747
Why don't you go in
and say hello?

20:57.814 --> 20:59.281
No, no.

20:59.349 --> 21:00.683
That would put him
in even more danger.

21:00.751 --> 21:02.118
We've never met.

21:02.185 --> 21:03.953
The family thinks
that Arthur Weisfelt's dead.

21:04.021 --> 21:05.121
It should stay that way.

21:05.188 --> 21:07.990
Man, this is a huge list.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.393
Was your whole family tree
subversive?

21:10.460 --> 21:11.894
Well, no.

21:11.962 --> 21:14.096
I had several cousins
who were refuseniks.

21:14.164 --> 21:15.531
Those days,
when one was grabbed,

21:15.599 --> 21:17.099
whole family was grabbed.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.834
So how are we supposed to warn
and protect everyone--

21:18.902 --> 21:20.302
we're not.

21:20.370 --> 21:22.371
We're gonna find
Alexander first.

21:22.439 --> 21:23.773
I got it.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.242
We find the bastard,
and then we go in guns blazing.

21:26.309 --> 21:27.710
We're not gonna do
any blazing.

21:27.778 --> 21:29.045
We're gonna keep
a low profile.

21:29.112 --> 21:31.047
This visit is not exactly
government sanctioned.

21:31.114 --> 21:32.515
So no help
from the local authorities

21:32.582 --> 21:33.883
and no diplomatic immunity.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.818
None.
What could they do to us?

21:35.886 --> 21:37.053
You two--

21:37.120 --> 21:38.854
they yell at you,
and they send you home.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.389
And what about you?

21:40.457 --> 21:43.426
I didn't change my name
to hide from our government.

21:43.493 --> 21:45.194
As far as the Russians
are concerned,

21:45.262 --> 21:48.898
I'm a spy
who betrayed them, so...

21:48.965 --> 21:50.166
See, that's something

21:50.233 --> 21:52.468
you could've brought up
on the plane.

21:52.536 --> 21:54.603
This is
the safe house where...

21:54.671 --> 21:57.573
Alexander and I used to meet.

21:57.641 --> 22:01.010
Alexander was a creature
of habit.

22:01.078 --> 22:04.013
If he's not here now,
he will be soon.

22:04.081 --> 22:08.084
Well, finally we're
one step ahead of this guy.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.220
He's on the roof.
Son of a bitch.

22:13.256 --> 22:15.091
Grenade!

22:18.595 --> 22:20.563
No.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.032
Croquet ball.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.333
Croquet ball.

22:24.401 --> 22:25.601
Oh, God.

22:25.669 --> 22:27.570
If he's got the other one...

22:27.637 --> 22:28.904
Get down!

22:28.972 --> 22:31.107
Down!

22:31.174 --> 22:34.543
Whoa!

22:34.611 --> 22:36.112
Whoa!

22:37.714 --> 22:39.115
All right, stay down.
Stay down!

22:39.182 --> 22:41.450
What, is this another
old friend of yours, Artie?

22:41.518 --> 22:43.753
Yeah, it's Charles II's
croquet ball,

22:43.820 --> 22:46.989
imbued with the fury of a King
and a sore loser.

22:47.057 --> 22:48.424
Oh, interesting sidebar--
later!

22:50.260 --> 22:52.495
Oh!

22:54.364 --> 22:56.031
So how do we stop it?
We don't!

22:56.099 --> 22:58.200
It's got to stop on its own.
It could take hours.

23:00.637 --> 23:03.405
The ball is lethal!
Stay out of its way!

23:14.133 --> 23:16.267
Okay, I think I can
make it to the door

23:16.335 --> 23:17.668
and then see
if I can spot him.

23:17.736 --> 23:19.237
Artie, be careful!

23:23.375 --> 23:25.476
Pete, get down!

23:25.544 --> 23:27.278
Uhh!

23:29.848 --> 23:31.182
Oh-ho.
Bye-bye.

23:31.250 --> 23:34.085
Aah! Ohh!

23:35.521 --> 23:38.422
Myka, do you think you can get
to the old fridge?

23:38.490 --> 23:40.358
What, are you hungry now?

23:40.425 --> 23:42.360
Just be prepared
to open it, okay?

23:42.427 --> 23:44.228
Right. Okay.
Okay.

23:44.296 --> 23:45.730
Ready?

23:45.798 --> 23:46.764
One...

23:46.832 --> 23:48.332
Two...

23:48.400 --> 23:49.734
Go!

23:52.671 --> 23:54.071
Whoa.

23:54.139 --> 23:55.206
Pete, behind you!

23:55.274 --> 23:57.241
Oh!

23:57.309 --> 23:59.477
Little league,
don't fail me now!

24:01.580 --> 24:03.181
Whoa ho ho ho ho!

24:08.821 --> 24:10.721
Wakah!
Pete...

24:10.789 --> 24:12.256
Artie's outside.

24:14.893 --> 24:16.427
Artie!

24:23.368 --> 24:25.169
Well, this isn't good.
You getting a vibe?

24:29.408 --> 24:31.342
Don't need one.

24:44.423 --> 24:46.858
Yeah, I'm here.

24:46.925 --> 24:48.993
Who are the...
Fighting Ocelots?

24:49.061 --> 24:50.027
Hmm?

24:50.095 --> 24:51.462
Claude, you have a post-it

24:51.530 --> 24:53.698
kind of stuck on your...

24:53.765 --> 24:56.200
Hey, you find any info
on Alexander?

24:56.268 --> 24:58.135
We've run
into a real dead end here.

24:58.203 --> 25:00.805
Uh, I pulled an all-nighter
digging for intel.

25:00.873 --> 25:02.473
And...
<i>Nada.</i>

25:02.541 --> 25:04.141
The Soviets
must have disappeared him.

25:04.209 --> 25:06.077
I'm running some
needle-in-a-haystack programs

25:06.144 --> 25:07.578
right now, but I'm gonna need
a little more info.

25:07.646 --> 25:08.846
Could you
put Artie on a sec?

25:08.914 --> 25:10.214
Can't. He's--
Artie got hungry,

25:10.282 --> 25:11.649
and he went out
for some borscht.

25:11.717 --> 25:14.652
Just, uh, get back to us.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.687
There's no use
in panicking Claudia.

25:16.755 --> 25:18.923
I mean, there's not much
she can do from there.

25:18.991 --> 25:21.092
There's not much
we can do from here.

25:21.159 --> 25:23.160
And now I want borscht.

25:31.436 --> 25:33.704
Wow.
Is that all on Alexander?

25:33.772 --> 25:35.439
This is on Alexander.

25:35.507 --> 25:37.341
This is on Todd.

25:37.409 --> 25:38.542
And I'm not stalking him.

25:38.610 --> 25:39.944
But look at this picture
I took of him.

25:40.012 --> 25:42.046
Look at that.
See the guy he's talking to?

25:42.114 --> 25:43.881
He's totally packing heat...

25:43.949 --> 25:45.149
In Univille.

25:45.217 --> 25:47.084
I mean, I saw that,
I figured...

25:47.152 --> 25:48.586
Maybe I should dig
a little deeper.

25:48.654 --> 25:50.888
School records,
tax--dental records.

25:50.956 --> 25:53.925
Claudia, that's
a little stalker-y.

25:53.992 --> 25:55.393
What did you find out?

25:55.460 --> 25:57.561
Nothing, until you get
behind the data.

25:57.629 --> 26:01.899
All of this info was entered
on the same day six months ago,

26:01.967 --> 26:05.069
right before Todd showed up
in our sleepy, little hamlet.

26:05.137 --> 26:06.671
Leena, what if Todd
is trying to use me

26:06.738 --> 26:08.205
to get into the Warehouse?

26:08.273 --> 26:09.407
I think I should go
to town and--

26:09.474 --> 26:10.975
no, you should stay
away from him

26:11.043 --> 26:13.144
until Artie gets back.

26:13.211 --> 26:15.146
Claudia.

26:15.213 --> 26:17.048
You're right.

26:17.115 --> 26:19.917
You're right. That's exactly
what I was thinking.

26:19.985 --> 26:21.585
Guess I'll just, uh,

26:21.653 --> 26:24.355
figure out which shelf
to put this thing on.

26:24.423 --> 26:25.990
I'll do that.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

26:26.058 --> 26:28.159
Okay.

26:29.895 --> 26:31.262
Too easy.

26:41.306 --> 26:43.341
Claudiola--
I was just thinking about you.

26:43.408 --> 26:44.642
Toddarama--

26:44.710 --> 26:46.410
settle a bet
for Pete and me.

26:46.478 --> 26:49.847
He thinks there's no High School
with an Ocelot mascot,

26:49.915 --> 26:51.115
but I thought you said

26:51.183 --> 26:53.184
your high-school football team
had one, right?

26:53.251 --> 26:54.952
Did we talk about this?

26:55.020 --> 26:56.587
Yeah, the Fighting Ocelots.

26:56.655 --> 26:59.557
I knew it!
The undefeated Ocelots.

26:59.624 --> 27:01.625
Pride and Joy of my youth.

27:02.861 --> 27:04.962
Listen, I was thinking.

27:05.030 --> 27:06.564
We should totally be friends
and hang out.

27:06.631 --> 27:09.033
Nice segue.
How about Friday?

27:09.101 --> 27:11.602
How about now?
Sounds good.

27:11.670 --> 27:13.904
Pond in the park
in, say, 45?

27:13.972 --> 27:16.040
Make it 40.
Great.

27:30.756 --> 27:32.523
Okay, we can't go
to the local police,

27:32.591 --> 27:34.158
and we certainly can't go
to the government.

27:34.226 --> 27:36.060
We don't know
how to call Mrs. Frederic.

27:36.128 --> 27:37.395
Well, all right,
what about--

27:37.462 --> 27:38.462
hold it.

27:38.530 --> 27:40.197
What?

27:44.436 --> 27:46.103
What?

27:48.340 --> 27:50.274
What is this?
What is--

27:50.342 --> 27:52.777
ah,
Ã£ for crying out loud.

27:52.844 --> 27:54.245
I think
someone's watching us.

27:54.312 --> 27:55.546
Why don't you
just say that?

27:55.614 --> 27:56.981
'Cause I'm trying
to act nonchalant.

27:57.049 --> 27:59.150
Oh, good job.

27:59.217 --> 28:00.751
All right.

28:00.819 --> 28:03.187
So, um, I still want you
to go that way.

28:03.255 --> 28:04.555
Mm-hmm.
Okay?

28:04.623 --> 28:07.491
And then I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go this way.

28:07.559 --> 28:09.827
Okay.
Take the bag, okay?

28:09.895 --> 28:11.896
We'll see who he follows.
Okay.

28:11.963 --> 28:13.931
All right, babe.
Well, I'll see you later.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.900
I'll see you at dinner.
Give me some sug--

28:15.967 --> 28:17.268
just go with it.
All right.

28:17.335 --> 28:18.335
Was that really
necessary?

28:25.343 --> 28:27.478
Hey, you.

28:27.546 --> 28:31.215
You mind telling me
what you're doing here?

28:31.283 --> 28:33.184
Hi.
You remember me?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.687
We really don't have time
for this.

28:36.755 --> 28:37.721
How did you find us?

28:39.591 --> 28:42.259
Receiver--
tells me the exact coordinates

28:42.327 --> 28:44.361
of the transmitter I slipped
into Myka's pocket

28:44.429 --> 28:45.763
at the cemetery,
and before you get angry--

28:45.831 --> 28:47.398
I'm not angry.

28:47.466 --> 28:48.966
Just tell me you also
slipped one of those

28:49.034 --> 28:50.234
into Artie's pocket too.

28:50.302 --> 28:51.802
Artie's gone?

28:51.870 --> 28:53.671
He was kidnapped.

28:53.738 --> 28:55.139
Probably by the same person

28:55.207 --> 28:58.175
who killed Dickinson
and Sweetwood.

28:58.243 --> 29:00.444
We could use your help.
Wait, Myka, no.

29:00.512 --> 29:01.879
Artie would blow a gasket.

29:01.947 --> 29:03.781
Pete, we need help,
and she's here.

29:03.849 --> 29:05.616
And for the record, I knew

29:05.684 --> 29:07.551
that you slipped this
in my pocket at the cemetery.

29:07.619 --> 29:09.787
I-I thought you'd know.
I knew you'd think that.

29:09.855 --> 29:11.222
Oh, all right.

29:11.289 --> 29:13.424
Look, we think
he might have been taken

29:13.492 --> 29:14.692
by his former
Soviet contact.

29:14.759 --> 29:16.760
That's impossible.
How do you know that?

29:16.828 --> 29:19.797
It couldn't have been
Alexander.

29:19.865 --> 29:23.534
That's why
Claudia's trail ran cold.

29:23.602 --> 29:26.237
You mind
filling me in here?

29:26.304 --> 29:29.373
Alexander died
13 years ago.

29:42.954 --> 29:44.655
Alexander.

29:44.723 --> 29:46.223
Alexei?

29:46.291 --> 29:48.125
It's you, isn't it?

29:49.594 --> 29:53.964
Why?
Some kind of revenge?

29:54.032 --> 29:55.599
Uhh!

29:58.036 --> 30:00.704
Alexander, listen...

30:00.772 --> 30:03.007
What we did...

30:03.074 --> 30:04.175
Was wrong.

30:04.242 --> 30:06.610
The artifacts were dangerous.

30:06.678 --> 30:09.313
They needed to be
locked away.

30:09.381 --> 30:11.282
That's why
I turned myself in.

30:11.349 --> 30:13.083
I didn't know
that they would punish you.

30:13.151 --> 30:15.119
Save your breath.

30:16.788 --> 30:18.455
You'll need it.

30:18.523 --> 30:20.324
Who the hell are you?

30:22.594 --> 30:25.796
The last person
you'll ever see.

30:30.558 --> 30:32.692
Arthur Weisfelt...

30:32.760 --> 30:35.662
The man I spend
my entire life hating.

30:35.730 --> 30:37.597
Oh, my God.

30:37.665 --> 30:40.300
You look just like...

30:40.368 --> 30:41.768
It's Ivan, right?
Ivan.

30:41.836 --> 30:43.336
You're Alexander's son.

30:43.404 --> 30:45.072
No.

30:45.139 --> 30:48.141
To be a son,
you would need a father.

30:48.209 --> 30:52.279
Mine spent his entire life
in prison because of you.

30:52.346 --> 30:54.347
Not me--
your government did that.

30:54.415 --> 30:57.818
You caused it.

30:57.885 --> 31:00.420
They gave you a new life...

31:00.488 --> 31:03.256
While my father died
in a cell.

31:05.393 --> 31:06.793
Now it's your turn.

31:10.398 --> 31:12.499
Do you really think we should
be going through Artie's bag?

31:12.567 --> 31:13.967
Yes, Pete!
Of course!

31:14.035 --> 31:16.136
Unless you have a better idea!
Okay, okay.

31:16.204 --> 31:18.438
Two Mykas--
this is gonna be fun.

31:18.506 --> 31:20.841
Hey, a compass--maybe this
is some sort of homing device

31:20.908 --> 31:22.209
that always points at Artie.

31:22.276 --> 31:25.612
No, no,
that would be too easy.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.948
Holy crap!
W-what does that do?

31:28.015 --> 31:29.282
It holds Artie's glasses.

31:29.350 --> 31:31.218
Right, so I can understand
your excitement.

31:31.285 --> 31:33.520
But Artie always
loses his glasses,

31:33.588 --> 31:35.822
which is why Claudia rigged them
so he could always find them!

31:35.890 --> 31:37.591
Is this the receiver?
No, he lost that weeks go.

31:37.658 --> 31:39.493
But...

31:39.560 --> 31:43.096
I know someone who has one.
Good job!

31:44.732 --> 31:47.367
You made it.
Of course. I said I would.

31:47.435 --> 31:49.569
People say a lot of things.
They do, they do.

31:49.637 --> 31:51.204
Hey, you don't drive
an old el Camino, do you?

31:51.272 --> 31:53.140
Me?
No, it's Artie's, actually.

31:53.207 --> 31:55.208
I hardly ever...

31:55.276 --> 31:57.210
Ah, screw it.

32:02.450 --> 32:03.583
What the hell is that?

32:03.651 --> 32:04.851
I'm asking
the questions here,

32:04.919 --> 32:05.986
starting with
who the hell are you?

32:06.053 --> 32:06.987
Me?
You don't exist.

32:07.054 --> 32:08.488
You're six months old.

32:08.556 --> 32:10.023
Why were you spying on me?
I figured you out, man.

32:10.091 --> 32:11.491
Think you can use me to get
into the Warehouse?

32:11.559 --> 32:13.260
What do I care
about an I.R.S. Warehouse?

32:13.327 --> 32:14.861
Bet you're just
as bad as MacPherson.

32:14.929 --> 32:16.129
You just want to--
wait, what?

32:16.197 --> 32:17.464
Who's MacPherson?

32:17.532 --> 32:19.065
You think
it's an I.R.S. Warehouse?

32:19.133 --> 32:20.433
Isn't it? Or ha!
Is that just your cover,

32:20.501 --> 32:21.735
working for John Conti?

32:21.802 --> 32:25.105
John Conti?
Who the hell's jo--

32:25.173 --> 32:26.706
wait, John Conti,
the mobster?

32:26.774 --> 32:28.108
Dude, I don't work for him.

32:28.176 --> 32:31.144
Then what the hell
is going on?

32:31.212 --> 32:33.513
Oh, Todd,
you're in trouble.

32:33.581 --> 32:35.582
Trying hard not to be.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.450
Was the Marshal right?
Am I a dead man?

32:37.518 --> 32:39.319
No, no, of course not.

32:39.387 --> 32:40.520
You're...

32:40.588 --> 32:42.022
Jinkies.

32:42.089 --> 32:44.658
You're in the Witness Protection
program, aren't you?

32:44.725 --> 32:46.993
Man, you didn't know?
No, I thought...

32:47.061 --> 32:49.296
Man, how the hell'd you get
yourself into the program?

32:49.363 --> 32:52.699
I was just an I.T. guy Conti
hired to recover a hard drive.

32:52.767 --> 32:54.401
I saw some files
I wasn't supposed to,

32:54.468 --> 32:55.802
and all of a sudden,

32:55.870 --> 32:57.771
I'm living in this weird town
in South Dakota.

32:57.838 --> 33:00.574
I-I wanted to tell you,
but I couldn't.

33:00.641 --> 33:02.576
And that--that guy
I saw you with was--

33:02.643 --> 33:04.311
my handler. He's pretty pissed
at me right now.

33:04.378 --> 33:05.712
I wasn't supposed to get
close to anybody,

33:05.780 --> 33:07.047
let alone fall in love
with them.

33:07.114 --> 33:09.683
Wait a second.
Back that up.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.618
Okay. "Love" is a really
strong word.

33:11.686 --> 33:12.886
No, no, no.
Further back.

33:12.954 --> 33:15.088
You mean you really are
a techie after all?

33:15.156 --> 33:16.056
Monster.

33:16.123 --> 33:18.258
Dude.

33:30.104 --> 33:33.073
The light is flashing.
He should be right here.

33:44.585 --> 33:48.188
I guess he was.

33:48.256 --> 33:50.957
This way.

33:54.829 --> 33:56.196
Oh, my God.

33:56.264 --> 33:58.498
You've got the jacks.

33:58.566 --> 34:00.867
So killing those men
and the list of my family,

34:00.935 --> 34:02.269
that was for what--

34:02.336 --> 34:04.938
just to--to--
to get me here?

34:09.643 --> 34:10.909
Ivan, no.

34:10.978 --> 34:12.612
Don't--don't--
don't use that.

34:12.679 --> 34:15.014
It doesn't just
affect victims.

34:15.081 --> 34:18.385
Whoever uses it,
it--it--it infects your soul,

34:18.452 --> 34:19.918
steals your humanity.

34:19.987 --> 34:22.222
And the longer you have it, the
more like Torquemada you become.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.523
Good.

34:23.591 --> 34:25.257
That will make this easier.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.971
Okay, where now?

34:38.039 --> 34:41.408
You guys take this corridor.
I'll go this way.

34:43.744 --> 34:45.512
Just help me
with this door.

34:58.359 --> 35:00.593
Why don't you just yell,
"here we come"?

35:00.661 --> 35:03.396
Hey!

35:03.464 --> 35:04.564
Be careful.

35:04.632 --> 35:05.799
Hey!
What?

35:05.866 --> 35:07.400
Come on.

35:28.589 --> 35:30.123
Artie.

35:30.191 --> 35:32.025
Artie.

35:35.363 --> 35:38.398
Oh, come on!
There's got to be another way.

35:48.642 --> 35:51.144
Oh! What?
Shh.

35:51.212 --> 35:53.012
What?
It's okay.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.180
What are you?

35:59.253 --> 36:01.020
Don't, no.

36:01.088 --> 36:03.423
Shh.
Behind you.

36:05.025 --> 36:06.292
It's okay.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.660
Y-you don't need to do this.

36:18.305 --> 36:19.839
It takes a few minutes.

36:21.609 --> 36:23.243
I want to watch you

36:23.310 --> 36:26.513
watch your friend die.

36:36.193 --> 36:37.627
Let her die.
I don't care.

36:37.694 --> 36:38.995
She means nothing to me.

36:39.062 --> 36:42.698
This woman who risks her life
to save yours?

36:42.766 --> 36:45.568
I see it's still very hazardous
to be your friend.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.674
There's no time.
What are you doing?

36:51.742 --> 36:54.076
Oh, jeez.

36:54.144 --> 36:55.678
Let's see
what this thing does.

36:55.746 --> 36:58.347
Okay.
And...Go!

36:58.415 --> 37:00.283
And...Activate! Fire!
Come on!

37:00.350 --> 37:03.185
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's a reflex hammer, right?

37:03.253 --> 37:07.123
Sure.
Okay, well...

37:12.996 --> 37:15.264
Now, that's cool. Let's go.
Yeah.

37:15.332 --> 37:17.300
Why?

37:17.367 --> 37:19.568
Ivan, why?
What's the point?

37:19.636 --> 37:21.304
What are you gonna do?
You just gonna kill people

37:21.371 --> 37:23.339
who have absolutely nothing
to do with this?

37:23.407 --> 37:26.309
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Her death will be quick.

37:26.376 --> 37:27.677
Not yours.

37:48.565 --> 37:50.266
Take this.
Hold this tight.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.600
It's the only thing
that'll reverse it.

37:51.668 --> 37:54.303
Hold it tight!

37:54.371 --> 37:55.971
You'll be all right.

37:56.039 --> 37:57.907
You all right?

37:57.974 --> 38:00.009
Yeah, yeah. That was
a good shot, by the way,

38:00.077 --> 38:01.377
unless you were
shooting at Ivan.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.915
If I'd shot him,
you'd still be chained there.

38:05.982 --> 38:07.450
And I would have frozen
to death.

38:07.517 --> 38:10.086
That was some good thinking.

38:10.153 --> 38:13.189
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.798
Well, that wasn't so hard.

38:31.408 --> 38:33.642
Say it again.

38:33.710 --> 38:36.712
Oh, come on.
Please? For me.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.481
My preferred method
of hacking

38:38.548 --> 38:40.883
is to use
an integrated secure toolkit

38:40.951 --> 38:43.285
applied a safe-type
concurrent algorithm

38:43.353 --> 38:46.355
derived from an active
binary work cluster

38:46.423 --> 38:48.557
embedded
in a synchronized metalevel

38:48.625 --> 38:50.860
high-speed architecture.

38:50.927 --> 38:52.661
I love it when
you talk tech.

38:52.729 --> 38:54.397
He's gonna be here soon.

38:54.464 --> 38:55.898
This sucks.

38:55.966 --> 38:57.566
We can finally talk.

38:57.634 --> 39:00.136
I finally feel like
I'm getting to know you.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.241
Aw.

39:05.308 --> 39:06.909
Suckity, suckity,
suck, suck, suck.

39:06.977 --> 39:08.344
Oh.

39:08.412 --> 39:10.913
Sorry, my handlers
are just too freaked.

39:10.981 --> 39:13.616
They think I'll be safer
someplace else.

39:13.683 --> 39:15.785
But, hey, if I live
to testify,

39:15.852 --> 39:18.154
I'll come back.

39:18.221 --> 39:21.557
Oh, that's
an interesting brush-off.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.893
I could always just send Conti
into an interdimensional space.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.127
What's that?

39:25.195 --> 39:27.096
Tell you later?
Not fair.

39:27.164 --> 39:28.264
Todd...

39:28.331 --> 39:29.465
Time to go.

39:41.745 --> 39:43.579
You know I'll find you.

39:43.647 --> 39:44.947
You better.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.593
How could you?

39:57.661 --> 39:59.361
You turned her in.

39:59.429 --> 40:01.030
You handed her
over to the Regents

40:01.097 --> 40:03.065
without even considering
that she might be

40:03.133 --> 40:05.434
a valuable asset and--
Myka.

40:05.502 --> 40:08.337
What makes you think
that this was his decision,

40:08.405 --> 40:10.606
Agent Bering?

40:10.674 --> 40:12.575
You seriously believe

40:12.642 --> 40:15.311
that there's not a thorough
and complete vetting process

40:15.378 --> 40:17.379
by which the agents
of Warehouse 13

40:17.447 --> 40:18.881
are selected?

40:18.949 --> 40:21.750
Mrs. Frederic recommends.

40:21.818 --> 40:24.453
Regents discuss.

40:24.521 --> 40:26.689
And I make
the final decision.

40:26.756 --> 40:29.058
Artie...

40:29.125 --> 40:30.392
So who's this guy now?

40:30.460 --> 40:34.497
Mr. Kosan,
Agent Lattimer, Agent Bering.

40:34.564 --> 40:37.700
Adwin Kosan is...

40:37.767 --> 40:40.669
On a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

40:40.737 --> 40:42.004
You make the decisions.

40:42.072 --> 40:43.973
Some of them.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.474
Yes.

40:45.542 --> 40:47.243
We have to trust
that Mr. Kosan

40:47.310 --> 40:49.812
will make the right choice.
The choice has been made.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.015
Has she been bronzed, then?

40:55.886 --> 40:57.853
Ms. Wells?

41:03.360 --> 41:07.229
This is thanks in no small part
to Agent Bering's report.

41:07.297 --> 41:10.165
To Agent Bering's re--
I tried to tell you, but--

41:10.233 --> 41:12.167
in conjunction
with our findings,

41:12.235 --> 41:15.337
H.G. Wells is to be
fully reinstated

41:15.405 --> 41:17.273
as a Warehouse Agent.

41:17.340 --> 41:19.808
She's convinced the Regents
that she's no longer a threat,

41:19.876 --> 41:21.844
but an asset.

41:21.912 --> 41:25.247
Welcome home, Agent Wells.

41:25.315 --> 41:26.315
Thank you, sir.

41:26.383 --> 41:29.818
Agent Wells.

41:29.886 --> 41:31.820
Reinstated?

41:34.558 --> 41:37.993
Be it ever so humble.

41:44.334 --> 41:46.569
Thank you.

41:46.636 --> 41:48.771
Without you,
I wouldn't be here.

41:48.838 --> 41:50.406
Well, I would,
but I'd be in bronze.

41:53.543 --> 41:55.244
Welcome to the team,
I guess, yeah?

41:55.312 --> 41:57.112
Thank you.

42:06.156 --> 42:08.257
No.

42:08.325 --> 42:09.758
This is wrong.

42:12.629 --> 42:14.463
Artie...
This is wrong!

42:20.070 --> 42:21.236
Artie!

42:21.304 --> 42:22.838
Artie?

42:25.542 --> 42:27.576
Artie! Wait!

42:27.644 --> 42:29.244
Artie, wait!

42:29.312 --> 42:31.146
Artie, don't you dare
just walk away.

42:31.214 --> 42:33.048
We went to Russia
so we could right the wrongs

42:33.116 --> 42:34.617
from your past.

42:34.684 --> 42:36.919
Don't you think that H.G.
deserves the same chance?

42:36.987 --> 42:38.320
You're saying
that she's just like me?

42:38.388 --> 42:40.522
You're wrong.
She's nothing like me!

42:40.590 --> 42:42.491
And no matter how much good
she's done for all of us,

42:42.559 --> 42:44.259
I'll never trust that woman.

42:44.327 --> 42:46.228
But if the Regents are sure,
don't you think you should--

42:46.296 --> 42:49.098
oh, now you want to know
what I think.

42:49.165 --> 42:52.635
I think I'm gonna regret
not letting her freeze to death.

42:52.702 --> 42:55.337
But by then,
it'll be too late...

42:55.405 --> 42:57.806
For all of us.
