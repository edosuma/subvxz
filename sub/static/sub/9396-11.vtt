<i>Previously, on</i> One Tree Hill...

00:03.703 --> 00:06.934
I've got a way for you to leave,
but you've got to go in the morning.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.406
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

00:08.475 --> 00:10.841
You know how much
I care about you, Anna...

00:12.445 --> 00:13.912
but there's somebody else.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.211
Is this what you're after?

00:22.088 --> 00:23.077
Jake.

00:23.857 --> 00:24.983
I lied to you.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.155
I slept with Keith.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.759
Hey, Jules. It's Keith.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.161
<i>I just realized something</i>
<i>and I had to say it.</i>

00:32.465 --> 00:34.456
I love you.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.401
Nice work, Jules. Just like we planned.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.471
Haley, you owe it to your music.
You owe it to yourself.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.436
Your dreams are a bus ride away.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.073
<i>I know it's scary.</i>

00:44.144 --> 00:46.476
But just tell me
if you can show me your heart.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.071
If you do, I'll guard it with my life.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.430
-I don't even have a toothbrush.
-I think they have those in New York.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.063
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.395
You did good, married girl.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.636
I can't do this.

01:59.652 --> 02:00.676
I'm sorry.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.014
Yeah, I figured.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.289
You're not ready.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.629
I'm sorry, Karen. I should have told you
about Keith--

02:51.704 --> 02:53.137
I think you should go.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.481
Haley?

03:18.264 --> 03:21.756
Haley didn't mess around.
You're Nathan, right?

03:21.834 --> 03:26.430
-Yeah. Do I know you?
-You should. I'm your sister-in-law.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.838
-Vivian?
-Don't make me smack you.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.275
-Quinn?
-Taylor.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.014
Haley never mentioned me to you?

03:36.115 --> 03:39.642
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.751
-You wanna grab that?
-What? Excuse me?

03:48.061 --> 03:51.497
-My suitcase.
-Yeah.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.496
So, Haley never said you were coming.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.469
She didn't know. So, where is little sis?

04:00.106 --> 04:01.095
Out.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.203
That's vague.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.969
I guess we'll have to get acquainted
until she gets home.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.243
Yeah. Sure. Just make yourself at home.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.451
Careful what you wish for,
little brother-in-law.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.389
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

04:24.864 --> 04:26.798
Rick, never mind. I made a mistake.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.434
High school girls.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.324
You were dreaming.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.997
I think you're okay now.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.701
Are you back for good? Where's Jenny?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.101
I didn't bring her.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.866
I'm only here a couple days
to check on you.

05:09.709 --> 05:13.440
So, what's got Lucas so worried,
he's gonna call my cousins in Savannah?

05:13.513 --> 05:15.276
Nothing. Now.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.185
So, you never answered any of my e-mails.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.482
Yeah, I'm sorry.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.057
I didn't want to give Nicki
any chance of tracking me down.

05:26.125 --> 05:29.288
I didn't want you to get caught up in
this even more, just in case.

05:29.362 --> 05:32.160
-Have you heard from her?
-No. But she's out there.

05:32.799 --> 05:34.767
She might still be in Seattle.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.030
That's where Brooke and
I told her you went.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.003
Are you gonna see Lucas
while you're here?

05:44.310 --> 05:46.938
I don't know. I'm gonna see my folks...

05:47.780 --> 05:50.806
but, other than that,
I kind of just want to keep a low profile.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.010
-Our secret, okay?
-Okay.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.118
Anyway, go back to bed.
We'll talk about this in the morning.

05:59.192 --> 06:03.060
-I'll crash on the floor.
-Jake, don't be stupid.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.536
Sounds like it finally stopped raining.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.281
Maybe it finally did.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.987
Where the hell have you been?

06:36.462 --> 06:39.954
I needed to clear my head. Nathan--

06:40.099 --> 06:42.795
Little sis, look at you!

06:43.102 --> 06:45.468
-Tay, what are you doing here?
-I'm on break...

06:45.538 --> 06:48.439
and I wanted to see the house before
the new people moved in.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.975
I haven't seen you in forever...

06:51.077 --> 06:54.103
and Mom told me that you got married,
so here I am.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.945
Nathan said I could stay
for a couple of days.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.675
-Actually, I--
-You won't even know that I'm here.

07:00.153 --> 07:04.419
Yeah, okay.
Can you give us a second, please?

07:10.496 --> 07:14.091
You said she could stay? Do you think
maybe that was worth a conversation?

07:14.167 --> 07:17.603
I told her she could make herself
comfortable because you weren't here.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.339
You were with Chris again, weren't you?

07:21.407 --> 07:23.272
-Yes. But I--
-Great.

07:23.342 --> 07:25.276
Will you just listen to me, please?

07:25.645 --> 07:29.581
It's over, okay. He left town.
He wanted me to go with him.

07:29.649 --> 07:33.642
-What?
-I said no because my life is here.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.519
He didn't mean anything to me, okay?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.320
Besides, we're gonna
have to stick together...

07:44.430 --> 07:46.489
if we're gonna survive Hurricane Taylor.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.632
Anna!

08:03.816 --> 08:06.785
-How are you?
-I was confused.

08:06.853 --> 08:10.016
I mean, after you showed up at my door
talking about other girls.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.951
But once I remembered you had
a reputation for being a total ass-hat...

08:14.026 --> 08:15.857
it pretty much cleared things up.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.759
Hey, Brooke.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.200
Nice necklace.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.135
Thanks. Felix gave it to me.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.171
I thought you guys were done.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.577
That was before we cranked it up
to full-on dating. Thus the loot.

08:41.386 --> 08:42.854
Are you sure about this?

08:43.990 --> 08:47.289
Look, Lucas, I know you don't like him.
But you don't really know him.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.954
Look, Brooke. I just want you to be happy.

08:52.064 --> 08:56.592
If I'm dating Felix and you're dating Anna,
does that mean we are somehow related?

08:57.236 --> 08:59.136
-Actually, Anna and I--
-Hey, Brooke.

08:59.805 --> 09:00.999
I forgot something.

09:05.611 --> 09:06.976
This. See you after.

09:10.349 --> 09:13.580
Lucas, I'm happy. I hope you are, too.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.627
<i>Hello?</i>

09:29.969 --> 09:34.099
I was looking for Andy Hargrove.
I must have dialed the wrong number.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.069
<i>Actually, I grabbed his phone by mistake.</i>
<i>He bought us both the same kind.</i>

09:38.644 --> 09:39.633
Is he there?

09:39.979 --> 09:41.844
<i>He's in the shower. Who's this?</i>

09:43.082 --> 09:45.277
A student. I'll call back.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.121
Karen? Are we ever going to talk?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.921
-What is there to say?
-That I made a mistake.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.362
Maybe what you did
with Keith was a mistake...

09:59.465 --> 10:01.660
but lying to me about it was a choice.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.328
One that I can't accept from
a business partner or my friend.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.276
So, since your mom
hired me to work here...

10:11.344 --> 10:14.745
Keith helped me do a crash
refresher course on bartending last night.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.008
Ask me anything.

10:16.248 --> 10:19.183
Okay. What's in a Long Island Iced Tea?

10:22.021 --> 10:24.046
Wouldn't you rather have a screwdriver?

10:28.561 --> 10:29.721
Hey, toss me that.

10:45.578 --> 10:49.571
-Lucas. Hey. It's early.
-Yeah, I know.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.544
-Can I talk to you?
-Sure.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.348
I was meeting Keith for breakfast
and, as usual, I'm late.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.787
But other than that....
Let me grab my shoes.

10:59.925 --> 11:03.520
-Everything okay?
-That's what I'm here to ask you.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.128
Is this about your mom?

11:05.231 --> 11:08.826
Because Keith told me the whole story,
and if you feel like I'm horning in.

11:09.702 --> 11:13.194
-How do you know Dan?
-Do I know a Dan?

11:13.472 --> 11:18.034
Dan Scott, Keith's brother. He called you
on your cell yesterday at the club.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.642
-Oh, that Dan.
-Why'd he call you?

11:22.882 --> 11:24.315
I bought a car from him...

11:24.884 --> 11:28.650
and Dan had some questions about
my credit references. What's going on?

11:30.122 --> 11:32.488
I'm just looking out for Keith.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.693
-Keith's all grown up, Lucas.
-Right.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.629
-Can we just forget this?
-Forget what?

11:42.068 --> 11:43.057
Thanks.

11:56.916 --> 12:00.010
-Peyton, this place is amazing.
-Thanks.

12:00.152 --> 12:03.383
It can be. It's just...it's harder
than I thought.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.823
When did you ever give up?

12:08.594 --> 12:12.086
Anyway, the big news
is Nathan and Haley got married.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.220
Married?

12:13.499 --> 12:14.591
-For real?
-Yeah.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.228
And it turns out Haley is, like,
this mega-talented musician...

12:18.304 --> 12:19.669
and she's going for it.

12:22.508 --> 12:23.668
What's the face?

12:25.444 --> 12:28.436
When I got off the bus,
I saw Haley kissing some guy.

12:29.014 --> 12:33.348
He was kind of scrawny, had a guitar case,
sort of pelty hair?

12:35.154 --> 12:38.021
-Who's he?
-Someone she shouldn't be kissing.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.890
Hey! Open up top!

12:45.598 --> 12:49.193
See, I don't know CPR, and even if I did,
I wouldn't give you mouth-to-mouth.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.327
Try not to drop
when I'm the only person around.

12:51.403 --> 12:53.530
I'm getting the stupid test.
Give me the damn ball.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.595
Forget it.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.703
Nice air ball.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.643
How about PlayStation?
Nobody croaked from that?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.515
That would involve me going home.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.582
You and Haley still fighting?

13:09.655 --> 13:12.624
-Her sister's here for a few days.
-Which one?

13:13.159 --> 13:15.127
-Taylor.
-Taylor?

13:17.196 --> 13:19.562
-Dude, she's crazy.
-Perfect.

13:20.332 --> 13:23.824
The thing is when I saw her,
I got that deja vu thing...

13:23.903 --> 13:26.394
like I'd seen her before.

13:26.605 --> 13:28.470
When we were freshmen,
she was a senior.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.372
So you probably saw her around school.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.138
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I've seen more of her than that.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.744
Two years ago, when they put me
on varsity from the freshman team...

13:37.817 --> 13:42.015
the seniors threw this kind of out-there
party at my parents' beach house.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.216
-Taylor was there.
-This is ugly.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.719
Yeah. I was pretty wasted...

13:52.698 --> 13:55.394
and she was kind of the first girl
I ever had sex with.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.663
Great. Laugh it up.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.936
The only good news about this is that...

14:01.006 --> 14:03.440
I don't think
she really even remembers me.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.735
You rocked her world, huh?

14:06.645 --> 14:09.273
-This is not funny!
-You're right. It's hilarious.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.649
-Come here. Come on.
-Heart patient, remember?

14:15.454 --> 14:16.614
How bad is it?

14:17.389 --> 14:21.792
Let's see. My mom threw our last piece
of Waterford at my dad last night...

14:22.294 --> 14:24.387
and it shattered
where the Hopper used to hang.

14:24.463 --> 14:28.490
Now he's sleeping in the pool house
while we still have one. So....

14:29.435 --> 14:31.528
They talking about moving? Say no.

14:32.171 --> 14:35.402
Not so much talking as yelling constantly.

14:36.008 --> 14:39.273
It's kind of gotten to the point where
I just don't want to go home.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.339
Then we won't.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.710
Come on. I'll buy you a nice dinner.

14:46.585 --> 14:50.316
No. Felix, we can't go in there.
Are you crazy?

14:50.422 --> 14:51.411
Why not?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.151
Because this is the place
where you made me do...

14:54.226 --> 14:56.888
the dine-and-dash thing on Dare Night.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.754
-What is so funny?
-You.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.400
Do you honestly think I'd do that to you?

15:02.768 --> 15:05.328
I paid the maitre d' on the way out
when I left you.

15:07.506 --> 15:10.339
-I'm full of surprises.
-You're full of something.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.808
You're home. Sorry about the mess.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.146
I needed a major hot soak
after my ten-mile run.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.191
-You run?
-How do you think I got this great ass?

15:29.461 --> 15:30.621
Are you blushing?

15:32.031 --> 15:33.020
Adorable.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.227
Run with me tomorrow if you can keep up.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.398
If you can keep up.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.938
I bought some beer. You want one?

15:43.309 --> 15:45.277
Yeah. Sure.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.575
Look at you. You're such a jock.

15:52.851 --> 15:56.343
So come talk to me. How bad is it?

15:58.624 --> 15:59.955
How bad is what?

16:01.427 --> 16:05.864
This thing between you and Haley.
Dinner chucked in the garbage...

16:06.398 --> 16:08.764
little sis coming home
in the middle of the night...

16:08.834 --> 16:13.669
hushed arguments behind closed doors.
Well, that, and she told me all about it.

16:14.173 --> 16:17.040
And she told you
Chris is out of the picture, right?

16:17.910 --> 16:19.002
Chris.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.708
Right. You were pretty threatened
by him, huh?

16:23.849 --> 16:26.215
Only because Haley was buying his crap.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.544
For a smart girl, Haley sure can be stupid.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.885
What's your issue with Haley?

16:35.160 --> 16:38.220
I think she blames me for all the pressure
she puts on herself.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.653
How so?

16:40.799 --> 16:43.768
She didn't want to disappoint
our parents like I did, I guess.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.502
I tend to screw up a lot.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.875
Yeah, I know how that is.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.466
Really?

16:59.518 --> 17:03.113
-Mind if I get another beer?
-No. I insist.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.013
Yeah, okay.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.162
I still can't believe
little sis snagged such a hottie.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.897
I mean, usually I get them first.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.339
Do want anything else?
After-dinner drink, dessert, new shoes?

17:25.411 --> 17:27.378
You don't have to buy me things.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.372
-Debit card okay?
-Of course.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.350
-Felix...
-It's okay, Brooke. You're with me now.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.547
I'm gonna take care of you.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.724
Looks like you were hungry.

17:45.831 --> 17:49.323
Yeah. I had a friend over.
You just missed him.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.704
-Him?
-It's not like that.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.800
I was gonna call you. It was just...

17:58.377 --> 18:02.211
the last time I saw you,
it was Pile-on-Peyton day.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.049
So, I'm sorry.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.846
You had a right to be pissed at me.
You needed a friend.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.982
And I wasn't there for you.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.249
Anyway...

18:17.062 --> 18:21.362
can I still take you up
on that we-can-talk-anytime offer?

18:22.034 --> 18:24.832
Yeah. Come on. What's up?

18:27.005 --> 18:29.473
Lucas kind of broke up with me.

18:30.375 --> 18:35.176
I mean, I'm not sure if we were even
dating, but now there's not even a chance.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.543
I'm sorry, Anna.

18:39.818 --> 18:43.083
-I don't know what I'm doing, Peyton.
-None of us do.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.125
Do you think
there's something wrong with me?

18:47.192 --> 18:49.319
What? No!

18:50.162 --> 18:52.562
I think maybe there's something wrong
with Lucas.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.129
Because you are great.

18:57.903 --> 18:58.892
Come here.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.813
-Oh, my God.
-Anna, that's not really my thing.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.450
-I'm sorry. I gotta go.
-It's cool. Anna!

19:32.671 --> 19:34.901
I hope this is okay.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.064
Look.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.575
I don't know what came over me.

19:40.946 --> 19:45.576
I was just pretty upset,
and I wasn't really thinking straight.

19:47.419 --> 19:52.049
-You know what I mean?
-Anna, it's cool, okay.

19:52.424 --> 19:54.688
Now a lot of stuff makes sense...

19:55.327 --> 19:57.295
like how you acted at the formal...

19:57.663 --> 20:00.131
and how you blew me off
after the whole locker thing.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.394
Can we please just forget the whole thing?

20:02.968 --> 20:04.560
Absolutely not.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.999
Don't be afraid to be who you are.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.707
We can still be friends, right?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.746
I don't know if I can do that.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.356
-Mine!
-Beat the girl! Such a gentleman!

20:29.761 --> 20:33.288
-Sorry. Good run.
-Yeah.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.730
If I don't run every day I go nuts.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.033
Started when I left home.
Been running ever since.

20:39.705 --> 20:43.505
-I know the feeling.
-Now I am all about the future.

20:45.711 --> 20:50.114
Speaking of which, we haven't
had our Molakarian Bathing Ritual, yet.

20:50.882 --> 20:51.871
Our what?

20:52.117 --> 20:54.312
The Molakars are a tribe
in the South Pacific...

20:54.386 --> 20:57.048
who celebrate weddings
with a family bath.

20:57.356 --> 21:00.382
-They must have a big tub.
-In the ocean, dumb ass.

21:00.626 --> 21:01.615
What?

21:01.860 --> 21:06.092
It symbolizes the washing away of past
sins, and the rebirth of the family soul.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.659
You have any idea how cold that water is?

21:09.368 --> 21:12.098
But I'm gonna appeal
to your competitive side, sissy.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.864
AII right. On three.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.073
-One, two--
-Three!

21:19.411 --> 21:21.470
What? Get back here.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.376
It's cold.

21:27.986 --> 21:28.975
Got you!

21:29.454 --> 21:32.389
-Molakars is a bar in Durham!
-What?

21:36.561 --> 21:37.823
I warned you, man.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.835
-This is really getting old.
-Not as old as you hurting my sister.

21:46.405 --> 21:49.238
-She's at home crying because of you.
-I'm sorry, man.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.672
But I don't see
how any of this is your business.

21:51.743 --> 21:55.235
Because I make it my business.
You hurt her, I hurt you.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.449
You don't want to do that.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.278
You're right.
What I want to be doing is this.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.021
Forget it.

22:23.308 --> 22:24.673
Yeah, one more thing.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.521
Damn, boy. Why aren't we living here?

22:40.892 --> 22:43.326
It's my dad's. I've got the keys though.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.922
Tell you what, I'll turn on the fireplace
if you grab the towels.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.989
-They're next--
-I know where they are.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.962
Varsity basketball....

22:56.808 --> 22:58.332
I was pretty wasted that night.

22:58.410 --> 23:02.107
-Oh, what? You don't remember me?
-No, of course, I remember you.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.282
I didn't think it would come back
to bite me in the ass.

23:06.084 --> 23:07.779
This time I'll only nibble.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.048
Why didn't you say anything?

23:13.158 --> 23:15.718
I was having too much fun
watching you squirm.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.263
Does that make me bad?

23:26.505 --> 23:27.494
Here.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.449
So, are you gonna tell me
why you're really in town?

23:40.552 --> 23:43.680
I screwed up at school.

23:44.523 --> 23:46.616
I got caught cheating on an exam.

23:47.192 --> 23:50.093
And then my professor and I got caught
cheating on his wife.

23:51.029 --> 23:53.554
He was paying my rent, expenses...

23:54.900 --> 23:57.630
until she found out,
and then that was that.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.667
So, I got kicked out.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.740
And the next thing,
I'm knocking on your door.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.806
So, how about we make a deal?

24:10.348 --> 24:13.840
You keep my secret, and I'll keep yours.

24:15.153 --> 24:17.121
That sounds like a good plan.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.924
Speaking of Haley, we should get back.

24:25.096 --> 24:26.586
I guess we could do that...

24:27.999 --> 24:28.988
this time.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.207
You know how you find a song
and you just listen to it, like...

24:37.275 --> 24:40.938
over and over again
until it becomes this, like...

24:41.279 --> 24:44.442
soundtrack until you find a new one?

24:45.717 --> 24:48.743
Or until you want to forget the things
that it reminds you of.

24:50.722 --> 24:53.623
-How's your life, Jake?
-It's been hard.

24:55.527 --> 24:56.824
I'm not in school...

24:57.596 --> 24:59.086
and I'm working crummy jobs.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.826
And the whole time I just keep
looking over my shoulder...

25:01.900 --> 25:04.869
thinking that Nicki's gonna swoop down
and snatch Jenny away.

25:07.772 --> 25:09.603
You know I have to go back, Peyton.

25:10.942 --> 25:13.570
-I know.
-I'd stay if I could.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.245
I want you to know that.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.114
-So when are you leaving?
-Tomorrow.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.793
I promised my folks
I'd have dinner with them tonight.

25:29.728 --> 25:32.891
But I'll stop by in the morning
before I head out.

25:36.067 --> 25:39.298
Can you stay here again tonight?
Just to sleep?

25:43.108 --> 25:44.837
I'll come back after dinner.

25:57.355 --> 26:00.756
I thought since you weren't answering
my calls maybe you'd been abducted.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.656
I assume your mother has an accent.

26:04.429 --> 26:05.623
Not to me, but yeah.

26:05.697 --> 26:09.758
-And you said you don't have a sister.
-Just one loser brother. What's this about?

26:11.436 --> 26:12.960
I called you in New York...

26:13.271 --> 26:15.705
and a woman answered
and said you were in the shower.

26:15.774 --> 26:19.266
Now this might not be fair to you,
but with everyone lying to me lately....

26:20.312 --> 26:21.301
Who is she?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.139
Look, Karen...

26:24.950 --> 26:27.316
this is something
that I'm not really proud of and--

26:27.385 --> 26:28.443
Tell you what.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.455
From now on, I'm the student,
you're the professor...

26:31.623 --> 26:33.056
and I'll see you in class.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.632
Nice. You guys finally decided
to come home.

26:41.833 --> 26:45.291
-I left you a note. We went for a jog.
-To where? Atlanta?

26:45.370 --> 26:47.998
I'm gonna go take a shower.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.809
We are supposed to be working
on our marriage.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.573
At least you knew where I was.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.310
This has to stop, Nathan.

26:59.851 --> 27:02.649
I don't want to lose you.
It's obvious that we have issues.

27:02.721 --> 27:05.588
-Now it just feels like you're avoiding me.
-I'm not avoiding you.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.557
Why are you spending
so much time with Taylor?

27:07.626 --> 27:11.118
-What? Are you threatened by her?
-I don't trust her.

27:21.272 --> 27:25.003
-Oh, girl. You look happy.
-I can't keep this.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.103
Why not?

27:30.815 --> 27:32.840
Because my mom married
my dad for his money...

27:32.917 --> 27:34.885
and you see how well that worked out.

27:35.553 --> 27:38.454
-You think that's all this is?
-I don't want to be like her.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.149
And you're giving me nice gifts
and buying me expensive meals...

27:42.227 --> 27:44.024
and I don't want to do it anymore.

27:44.295 --> 27:48.129
-Are you breaking up with me?
-No. Just with your money.

27:49.300 --> 27:52.792
I need to start feeling good about myself,
so I can feel good about us.

27:53.438 --> 27:56.032
-Okay?
-Okay.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.908
I really don't want to go home.

28:04.582 --> 28:07.210
-Spend the night with me.
-I'm not in the mood.

28:07.952 --> 28:11.251
So? Spend the night anyway.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.222
You really are full of surprises, aren't you?

28:33.211 --> 28:34.576
Trouble sleeping?

28:37.415 --> 28:39.383
Just listening to you breathe.

28:41.486 --> 28:43.044
And thinking about stuff.

28:45.023 --> 28:48.584
AII right, Peyton, I've gotta ask you.
The other night, when I found you...

28:50.128 --> 28:52.460
that was a drug deal, I mean, right?

28:53.098 --> 28:55.328
Lucas called me for a reason and....

29:00.505 --> 29:05.169
I did coke with that guy,
but it was one time.

29:05.443 --> 29:08.571
And it was stupid. I know.

29:09.314 --> 29:12.511
You've got so much going on.
Why would you need a crutch like that?

29:14.419 --> 29:15.545
I was weak.

29:18.957 --> 29:21.391
-You don't have to worry about me, Jake.
-I know.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.526
But what if I want to?

29:32.904 --> 29:34.565
-Hey, Jules.
-Lucas.

29:34.906 --> 29:38.398
-People are gonna start talking--
-You lied to me about how you know Dan.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.911
I checked you out at the dealership.

29:42.046 --> 29:43.411
Come inside, okay?

29:48.119 --> 29:51.520
So, I know you paid cash for the car...

29:51.623 --> 29:54.490
which means there was no credit check.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.960
About two years ago,
I was engaged to this guy.

30:00.231 --> 30:03.564
I was crazy about him,
even after he hit me a few times.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.060
I thought it wasn't
going to happen again...

30:06.137 --> 30:08.469
until he put me in the hospital
for two weeks.

30:09.274 --> 30:10.901
He disappeared after that...

30:11.476 --> 30:15.207
and my welcome-home present was
finding that I was over $150,000 in debt...

30:15.814 --> 30:17.805
with no way to pay the medical bills.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.447
I was beyond desperate, Lucas.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.979
So I posted an ad on this website...

30:28.259 --> 30:30.386
saying I'd do anything legal for money.

30:31.062 --> 30:32.461
And Dan answered.

30:33.331 --> 30:37.028
He said he'd help me out.
He started paying my medical bills.

30:40.738 --> 30:41.727
So...

30:43.241 --> 30:47.439
-what did he ask you to do?
-Make Keith fall in love with me.

30:49.881 --> 30:51.348
Then break his heart.

30:54.352 --> 30:58.220
I tried to tell Dan that I wasn't going
to go through with it, but it's too late.

30:59.724 --> 31:02.215
I never thought I was gonna
fall in love with Keith.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.223
But I did, Lucas.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.595
You have to believe me.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.096
I love him.

31:21.079 --> 31:25.140
I thought I was having a bad dream,
only to wake up and find out it's real.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.146
But I know that you have to go.

31:28.653 --> 31:31.121
Last night you said you were feeling weak.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.988
Let me show you something I use
when I'm feeling weak.

31:38.196 --> 31:41.859
''If my hopes could bring you home,
you and Jenny would be with me now.''

31:42.133 --> 31:44.260
Is this the first e-mail I sent you?

31:45.436 --> 31:48.200
It's, like, I'd be working one of those jobs...

31:48.806 --> 31:52.537
or feeling like I was gonna be on the run
forever and I'd read those words...

31:54.612 --> 31:57.672
and it's like this sudden calm
would wash over me.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.686
You are so strong, Peyton.
You don't even know it.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.082
You got me
through some pretty dark days.

32:08.092 --> 32:13.052
I've been thinking that if I can get all that
from some words on a piece of paper...

32:15.266 --> 32:18.497
just imagine what it would be like
to have the real thing every day.

32:21.372 --> 32:23.363
I'm tired of running, Peyton.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.011
Come with me.
Let's bring Jenny back home.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.271
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.681
-What are you doing?
-I'm helping you pack.

32:40.425 --> 32:43.121
-Am I packing?
-That's where I'm sending you. Packing.

32:43.194 --> 32:44.491
-Wait a minute.
-You know what?

32:44.562 --> 32:47.895
The complaint window is closed.
It's time for you to go back to school.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.491
-I'm done with school.
-I'm sorry.

32:50.568 --> 32:54.504
I need to be here working on saving my
marriage, and you're getting in the way.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.437
I need a few days to figure things out.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.941
A few days is gonna turn
into a few weeks. I know you.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.807
By then it might be too late
for Nathan and me.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.971
We have to let her stay, Haley.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.212
She's family.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.287
Just until you figure out
what you're gonna do, all right?

33:12.590 --> 33:14.353
Sure. Thanks, Nathan.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.201
Today we're gonna pick up
with managerial ethics...

33:26.270 --> 33:28.295
where we left off just before my trip.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.648
Actually, no. Change of plan. Forget that.

33:41.119 --> 33:44.486
Who can tell me the word that I wrote
on the board on the first day?

33:46.257 --> 33:47.246
Karen?

33:50.395 --> 33:52.158
-Greed.
-That's right.

33:52.230 --> 33:55.722
It's a motivating factor in business,
religion, politics....

33:56.467 --> 33:58.401
I know it sure as hell motivated me.

33:59.670 --> 34:00.659
Or it used to.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.640
Three years ago,
I was barreling along in my SUV...

34:04.709 --> 34:08.167
on my way to yet another meeting
with yet another financial group.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.610
At that point in time my liquid assets
totaled around $31 million.

34:12.683 --> 34:14.344
On my cell, I had a broker...

34:14.418 --> 34:17.717
who could have pushed my net worth up
by another quarter of a million.

34:17.789 --> 34:19.380
And I was so on my game this day.

34:19.456 --> 34:23.791
I was saying all the right things,
turning all the right screws, when...

34:29.000 --> 34:30.399
I didn't even see her...

34:31.569 --> 34:33.092
until I got out of the car.

34:34.539 --> 34:38.304
By that time, she was lying
in a pretty impossible angle...

34:38.876 --> 34:42.039
and there was so much blood
that I was sure that I'd killed her.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.841
But she survived. Her name is Miriam.

34:48.286 --> 34:51.777
And, she's gonna carry that accident
around with her forever.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.217
As will I.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.786
Since then I've tried to do right by her,
and twice a year...

35:00.865 --> 35:02.696
I visit her and her son...

35:03.601 --> 35:05.228
to make sure they're okay.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.631
And some people will say that I do
that out of guilt, and that may be.

35:09.707 --> 35:13.768
But there's another reason I do it.
I do it to remind myself that, in this life...

35:15.012 --> 35:17.139
there's a point when enough is enough.

35:17.748 --> 35:21.616
If you're haggling over money that you
don't even need, enough is enough.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.079
Just believe me on that.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.757
So if you'll still have me...

35:35.466 --> 35:36.899
managerial ethics.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.936
-Tunes for the road?
-Yep, right here.

35:42.006 --> 35:43.940
-You got your bag?
-In the trunk.

35:44.008 --> 35:44.997
Beef jerky?

35:45.109 --> 35:48.476
Come on, you can't have a road trip
without beef jerky. You're buying.

35:48.546 --> 35:51.037
Okay. How about, I got my debit card.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.118
-We'll just stop at the first truck stop.
-Now we're talking.

35:55.286 --> 35:56.548
Top up or top down?

35:57.889 --> 35:58.878
Down.

35:59.857 --> 36:01.415
I don't think it's gonna rain today.

36:17.241 --> 36:19.869
I know you have no reason
to believe anything I say...

36:19.944 --> 36:22.378
but I feel awful about this, Karen.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.116
Our friendship has gotten me through
some pretty dark days.

36:26.217 --> 36:27.844
I never meant to betray that.

36:29.353 --> 36:32.948
But I can have my lawyer draw up
the papers to dissolve our partnership...

36:33.024 --> 36:34.582
if that's what you want.

36:35.293 --> 36:36.282
It isn't, Deb.

36:38.229 --> 36:40.891
Just please don't lie to me again.

36:46.103 --> 36:47.968
Felix told me what happened.

36:50.775 --> 36:51.764
I'll live.

36:53.411 --> 36:56.471
I kind of owe you the biggest apology
in the world, Lucas.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.008
-Me?
-Yeah.

37:00.284 --> 37:01.410
Because...

37:03.321 --> 37:06.813
I've been blaming a lot of stuff on you
that isn't your fault.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.719
The last place we lived,
the all-girl school I went to...

37:13.397 --> 37:16.628
there were these rumors
that got started...

37:17.468 --> 37:19.265
and my family found out.

37:19.337 --> 37:23.034
And I made a big deal out of it all,
and we moved.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.801
Felix was pissed at me because of that.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.809
But the thing is, Lucas,
those rumors weren't just rumors.

37:35.219 --> 37:36.652
They were true.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.917
What were the rumors?

37:42.693 --> 37:44.058
That I like girls.

37:50.568 --> 37:54.265
You're the first person I've ever said
those words to out loud.

37:55.539 --> 37:56.528
Okay.

37:58.976 --> 38:02.468
I'm into guys, too,
so it's kind of confusing...

38:03.914 --> 38:06.041
and I guess I put all my hopes on you...

38:06.951 --> 38:08.111
which wasn't fair.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.649
I thought since you liked me,
and I liked you...

38:11.722 --> 38:14.247
maybe that would make it go away...

38:16.627 --> 38:21.462
until you broke things off, and then there
I was, right back where I started.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.695
I'm not proud of it,
but that's why I was mad at you.

38:28.439 --> 38:30.498
Only I guess I was really mad at myself.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.274
This is a new one.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.475
I'm not ready for people to know.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.212
Especially Felix.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.978
I won't say anything.

38:45.556 --> 38:46.580
Thanks.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.124
And I won't say anything
about you and Brooke.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.628
What about me and Brooke?

38:56.133 --> 38:58.328
She's the girl you like, right?

38:58.669 --> 39:00.796
I mean, it's kind of obvious.

39:03.307 --> 39:05.172
I thought I was cooler than that.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.804
Apparently not.

39:10.748 --> 39:11.737
Come here.

39:35.773 --> 39:38.173
-I want you to have this.
-Felix....

39:38.242 --> 39:40.506
It's a gift, not a payment.

39:42.046 --> 39:45.482
And I didn't buy it for you
as much as I bought it for me.

39:45.850 --> 39:47.977
Seeing you wear it makes me happy.

40:06.103 --> 40:07.229
Sandwiches?

40:10.975 --> 40:13.443
You like crow?
Because I've been craving it lately.

40:14.945 --> 40:16.173
Don't worry about it.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.109
It's about time I owned up to my mistakes.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.239
Me, too.

40:27.691 --> 40:30.626
-This isn't really crow, I hope.
-Turkey with Swiss.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.960
Apologies on the side.

40:48.646 --> 40:50.238
-Hey.
-Keith.

40:50.981 --> 40:54.007
-Can I talk to you?
-Sure. Come on in.

40:58.923 --> 41:01.153
Did I happen to leave my MP3 player here?

41:01.358 --> 41:04.259
-No, haven't seen it.
-Right.

41:05.362 --> 41:07.330
What? You wanna come in and hang out?

41:08.365 --> 41:10.959
No, I'm okay. See you.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.484
Feeling left out?

41:33.624 --> 41:34.613
A little.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.490
You wanna be left out together?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.316
Do you need some help?

42:04.321 --> 42:05.515
Yeah, sure.

43:01.779 --> 43:02.768
