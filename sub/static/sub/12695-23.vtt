WEBVTT

00:09.243 --> 00:12.513
- The gong has a variety
of uses in China.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.683
Allow me to demonstrate
the most obvious one--

00:15.783 --> 00:18.119
to wake someone up.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.554
- [loud clang]
- I'm up! I'm up! I'm up!

00:20.654 --> 00:23.657
- Even with all that crusty
drool all over his face,

00:23.757 --> 00:26.427
he's still adorable.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.829
- Sarah, as your friend,
I have to tell you

00:28.929 --> 00:33.134
that gong would treat you better
than my brother would.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.436
- This week's assignment
is to break into groups

00:35.536 --> 00:38.339
and do a presentation
on Chinese culture.

00:38.439 --> 00:41.008
- Yes! I love working in groups.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.710
- Only because it's
less work for you.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.011
- Yeah, more like no work.

00:44.112 --> 00:48.116
Now to find a group of
nerds to call my own.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.251
- All right, I know you're
not talking about my group,

00:50.351 --> 00:52.220
because we are not nerds.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.124
- Come on, Phoebe, all aboard
the "A"-plus train!

00:56.224 --> 00:58.892
- ALL: Choo-choo!

00:58.992 --> 01:02.630
- You're right,
you're not nerds,

01:02.730 --> 01:04.632
you're clearly dweebs.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.134
- Yeah, call us
whatever you want,

01:06.234 --> 01:08.336
there is no other group
I'd rather be in.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.803
- Be in our group, Phoebe.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.973
- Except that one!

01:13.141 --> 01:16.344
- Ha...

01:16.444 --> 01:18.779
- Two groups. One girl.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.982
What will Phoebe do?

01:22.150 --> 01:24.418
- Get out of my face, Max.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.255
- Will she go with Winnie,
the popular girl

01:27.355 --> 01:31.392
she's been trying to be
friends with for a year?

01:31.492 --> 01:34.862
Or will she stay with
Sarah and board

01:34.962 --> 01:39.167
the boring train to Dweebville?

01:39.267 --> 01:41.169
- Well, I mean,
Sarah is my friend.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.403
- Winnie could be
your friend, too,

01:42.503 --> 01:44.205
and not make you dress
up like you're going to

01:44.305 --> 01:48.309
a third-grader's birthday party.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.977
- Oh, we should
send a picture of us

01:50.077 --> 01:51.945
to the yearbook
for the selfie page.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.182
Say "China!"

01:54.215 --> 01:57.385
- ALL: China!
- [cell phone camera clicking]

01:57.485 --> 01:59.387
- I can't believe
Phoebe ditched us.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.088
Now who are we gonna get?

02:01.189 --> 02:03.724
- Hey, Sarah, can I join your--
- MAX: [powers zapping]

02:03.824 --> 02:05.326
- Ooh!

02:05.426 --> 02:06.627
- What's up, group?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.562
Heard your train
needs a caboose.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.865
Choo-choo!

02:11.965 --> 02:14.202
- *

02:14.302 --> 02:15.436
* What you see

02:15.536 --> 02:17.070
* Is not what you get

02:17.205 --> 02:20.208
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:20.308 --> 02:21.975
* We fit right in

02:22.075 --> 02:23.477
* Bet you never guessed

02:23.577 --> 02:24.978
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:25.078 --> 02:26.580
* Just like all the rest

02:26.680 --> 02:28.349
* A picture
perfect family *

02:28.449 --> 02:30.418
* Is what we try to be

02:30.518 --> 02:31.619
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:31.719 --> 02:33.387
* The crazy things we do

02:33.487 --> 02:35.223
* This isn't
make believe *

02:35.256 --> 02:36.924
* It's our reality

02:37.024 --> 02:38.326
* Just your average family

02:38.426 --> 02:41.395
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:41.495 --> 02:45.065
* Livin' a double life

02:48.769 --> 02:51.905
- Hey, Sarah, look, I'm so sorry
I'm not with you guys.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.442
It's just that Winnie's
group really needs me.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.043
And you get it, don't you?

02:56.143 --> 02:59.012
- Sure, I get it--you're hoppin'
off the "A"-plus train.

02:59.112 --> 02:59.880
- BOTH: [laughing]

02:59.980 --> 03:02.850
- Good luck on the "D"-plus bus.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.619
- Guys, I am really excited
about this group.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.588
You feelin' the love, Tyler?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.490
- You stole my bike last week.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.058
- Hey, I did you a favor.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.294
That thing fell apart
the moment I busted it.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.932
- Sarah, I don't think Max
is gonna do much.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.769
- Why would you say that?
- Because he's leaving.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.171
- Max! Get back here!

03:24.272 --> 03:27.341
- [groaning loudly]

03:27.441 --> 03:28.776
[sighing loudly]

03:28.876 --> 03:31.011
- Look, you'll always be my bae.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.880
But you need to take this
project as seriously

03:32.980 --> 03:35.516
as I take our forbidden love.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.485
- Believe me, I want
the "A," too.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.919
That's the only reason
I joined this group.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.054
- Great! So, what's your
idea for the project?

03:41.154 --> 03:42.590
- Uh, I don't know.
What's yours?

03:42.690 --> 03:46.594
- Build a Chinese dragon.
- Me, too, bae!

03:48.061 --> 03:50.030
- So, I was thinking
after school

03:50.130 --> 03:51.999
we could work on
our project at the library.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.201
- Oooh, is that
the new club downtown?

03:56.304 --> 03:59.473
- No, it's the place
we go to learn things.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.174
- Phoebe's right.
We'll meet at the mall.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.811
- That's not what I said.
- Yay, the mall.

04:08.316 --> 04:12.152
- All right, let's check
our "to-do" list.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.356
First thing--
write a "to-do" list.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.724
- BOTH: Did it!
- [palms slap]

04:16.824 --> 04:18.459
- All right, then I'll
fix the dishwasher.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.328
- I can pick up dry cleaning.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.363
- I'll mow the lawn.
The only other thing is--

04:22.463 --> 04:26.634
- [floorboards cracking]
- BOTH: Fix the floorboards.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.470
- Oh, Billy! Are you okay?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.539
- The house ate my legs!

04:31.639 --> 04:34.908
- You just fell in the floor
that dad was supposed to fix.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.244
- Sorry, buddy,
I've just been busy.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.146
- I don't think you've
been that busy.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.915
That chandelier's been sitting
in its box so long

04:42.015 --> 04:44.952
that it's turned into
an end table!

04:45.052 --> 04:47.555
- Okay, I'll just put
it on the "to-do" list--

04:47.655 --> 04:52.025
right after "ground Nora
for being sassy."

04:52.125 --> 04:55.128
- Yeah, you kids have no idea
how hard we work around here.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.930
- Is that why we had a salt
and pepper sandwich

04:57.030 --> 04:58.999
for dinner last night?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.569
- We didn't have time
to go shopping.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.936
- Oh, is that a new necklace?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.705
- I meant food shopping.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.039
- Cut her some slack.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.543
Your clothes are clean
and the house is spotless.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.381
- BARB: Mm-hm.
- Is it, Dad? Is it?

05:13.447 --> 05:16.750
- [objects clattering]

05:16.850 --> 05:18.519
- [suitcase thudding]

05:18.619 --> 05:22.022
- So, you two think it's
so easy to cook, clean,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.658
repair things and do
everything else

05:24.758 --> 05:26.994
while you two just enjoy
your little lives?

05:27.094 --> 05:29.397
- Kind of.
- I think so.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.565
- Okay, so you can take
care of the house

05:31.665 --> 05:35.836
and try to do better while
we enjoy our little lives.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.406
- Fine, but if we do better
running this house,

05:38.472 --> 05:41.842
then we get to be in charge
around here from now on.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.512
- We'll tell you what to eat,
when to go to bed,

05:44.612 --> 05:47.415
and ground you for
being sassy.

05:47.481 --> 05:51.051
- Deal--and when you fail,
you two will finally appreciate

05:51.151 --> 05:52.920
what your father
and I do around here.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.424
- Including making
really great lists.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.026
- Uh, is pull your son
out of the sinkhole

05:59.126 --> 06:01.929
on that "great" list?

06:02.029 --> 06:05.132
- No, but I will add it.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.674
- We are nailing
this dragon, guys.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.943
- You know, Max, we've been
doing this for a couple of days

06:16.043 --> 06:17.778
and I'm not sure I've seen
you leave that chair.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.813
- [laughing]
Oh, Ernie...

06:19.913 --> 06:22.983
- It's Evan.
- Let's agree to disagree.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.119
- Max, Evan's right.
You need to do your part.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.321
But it's getting hot,

06:28.456 --> 06:31.224
so if you want to put on
a tank top, that's fine.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.994
- Wow, guys, your dragon
looks awesome.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.465
I'm impressed.
- You're impressed?

06:37.531 --> 06:38.566
What? You didn't think

06:38.666 --> 06:40.233
we could do something
so cool without you?

06:40.333 --> 06:43.003
- No, no, I'm just surprised
Max hasn't dragged you down.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.173
His nickname around our house
is "dead weight."

06:46.273 --> 06:48.041
- Don't listen to her, Sarah.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.612
She's jealous 'cause our group
works so well together.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.347
Ernie, refill!

06:54.482 --> 06:56.984
- So, how's your group
coming along?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.152
- It's going great.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.221
I mean, all those girls wanna
do is work, work, work.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.223
- You forgot all the clothes
you bought at the mall.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.493
- Thanks, Winnie.
[laughing]

07:07.928 --> 07:09.296
These are for research.

07:09.396 --> 07:12.866
Haven't you ever heard of
the Great Mall of China?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.735
- No.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.337
- Well, don't you feel silly.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.809
- Uh-oh, my cheeks are tingling.

07:21.909 --> 07:25.679
That means it's gonna rain--
or this glue contains shellfish!

07:25.779 --> 07:29.617
- I should have never said "Hi"
to you in the fourth grade.

07:29.717 --> 07:33.286
- Max, we have to leave, so
after the paper mache dries,

07:33.386 --> 07:35.689
can you put it in the garage?
- On it.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.925
- Maybe we should come back
and put it away ourselves.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.693
- Tyler, Max said he'll do it.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.196
Would someone with dimples you
could swim in let us down?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.065
- Guys, relax. I'm not an idiot.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.535
I'll bring our dragon
inside before it rains.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.737
- [thunder crashing,
wind gusting]

07:53.240 --> 07:55.108
- I should wake Max up

07:55.208 --> 07:57.110
and tell him that paper
dragon's out there.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.113
- [thunder crashing]

08:00.213 --> 08:04.017
- [sighing]
Wow, it's really rainin'.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.253
Wait, did I forget something?

08:06.353 --> 08:09.690
- Nope. Go back to bed.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.725
- MAX: [sniffling]

08:11.825 --> 08:14.127
- I'm a bad, bad bunny.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.096
[quietly laughing]

08:16.196 --> 08:18.298
- [thunder crashing]
- Mm-hm.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.804
- [yawning]

08:28.075 --> 08:30.377
- [footsteps pounding]

08:30.477 --> 08:32.580
- Hank, what are you doing?

08:32.646 --> 08:33.947
- The kids fixed
the floorboards.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.449
It's perfect.
I can't believe it.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.451
- This must have taken
them all night.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.421
Do I smell bacon?
- HANK: [sniffing]

08:41.589 --> 08:44.291
Apple hickory
with a hint of maple.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.059
Ten pieces.
[sniffing]

08:46.159 --> 08:49.229
No, nine. Someone's eating it!

08:49.329 --> 08:52.700
- Wow, kids, breakfast, too?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.902
When did you find time
to do all this?

08:55.002 --> 08:57.337
- Got up early
and just did it.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.139
- We work best in
the morning, you know,

08:59.239 --> 09:02.275
when you two are sleeping in.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.411
- Well, this is all very nice.

09:04.511 --> 09:08.716
Too bad I was in the mood
for pancakes.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.051
- BILLY: [zooming]

09:13.621 --> 09:16.023
- Please, it's gonna take a lot
more than a fixed floor

09:16.123 --> 09:20.227
and a hot breakfast to impress
us, am I right, Hank?

09:20.327 --> 09:21.962
- The syrup is warm.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.431
Warm!

09:27.635 --> 09:29.369
- Look, girls, Phoebe's
rocking her new shoes.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.704
Love them!

09:30.804 --> 09:32.439
- You know what else
you're gonna love?

09:32.539 --> 09:34.642
The project topics
I came up with last night.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.543
All stuff we can put
together by tomorrow.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.311
- Oh, Phoebe, we'll be fine.
We'll wing it.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.681
As long as we look good,
we'll get a "C".

09:40.781 --> 09:44.752
- A "C"?
You guys want a "C"?

09:44.852 --> 09:48.822
- Oh, my gosh, daddy would
be so happy if I got a "C".

09:48.922 --> 09:51.892
- Hey, listen, how about we'll
meet at my house after school.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.994
We'll work really hard
and nail this thing.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.197
Imagine how happy daddy would
be, if you got an "A".

09:57.297 --> 09:59.266
- Shoot, I can't tonight.
I have plans.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.168
- Yeah, me, too.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.136
I've gotta babysit
my little brother.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.805
- But you're an only child.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.373
- Busted!

10:06.473 --> 10:09.576
Sorry, I just really
don't wanna do it.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.578
- Listen, I can't do
this by myself.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.613
You guys are gonna have to put
in some of the work or,

10:13.714 --> 10:15.582
and I'm sorry
to have to say this,

10:15.683 --> 10:17.384
I can't be part of the group.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.518
- Okay.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.920
- Great. Let's get to work.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.824
- No, I mean, okay, you're
not part of the group.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.936
- [sighing]
Hey, Sarah, uh, crazy morning.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.138
It turns out my group
kinda doesn't like to focus,

10:38.238 --> 10:39.372
so we parted ways.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.241
- But if you don't have
a group, you'll fail.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.444
- Which is why I wanna get back
on the old "A"-plus train.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.280
Choo-choo!

10:47.380 --> 10:49.116
- Sorry, that train's full.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.786
Maybe you can catch the next one
to the Great Mall of China.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.122
- [laughing] But there
is no Great Mall of--

10:55.222 --> 10:58.158
oh, I see what you did there.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.732
- Hi, uh, just a quick heads up.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.100
I ran into a little snafu with
that whole group project thing,

11:07.200 --> 11:11.805
so I think I'm just gonna
solo, you know, Team Phoebe!

11:11.905 --> 11:14.107
Party of one!

11:14.207 --> 11:17.044
Party of fun!

11:17.144 --> 11:19.913
- I'm sorry, but being in a
group is part of the assignment.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.515
You have to be able to work
with people or you fail.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.117
- But all the groups are full.

11:24.217 --> 11:28.021
- SARAH: You did what?

11:28.121 --> 11:32.960
- Holy hog wart,
our dragon is ruined!

11:33.060 --> 11:35.562
- How could you forget to
put it inside of the garage?

11:35.662 --> 11:37.898
- Well, I was going to, but...

11:37.998 --> 11:43.103
I was so tired from carrying
around these muscles all day--

11:43.203 --> 11:45.005
I fell asleep.

11:45.105 --> 11:52.112
- Oh, getting the proper amount
of sleep is so-o-o-o important.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.781
- Don't look at his muscles!

11:53.814 --> 11:57.785
- He's right. Let them look
at you. [clicking tongue]

11:57.818 --> 12:02.355
- Okay, Sarah, I am
taking your glasses.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.257
- Tyler! Now I can't
see anything.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.226
Except the truth!

12:06.326 --> 12:08.395
Max, you're out of the group!

12:08.495 --> 12:09.696
You can still date me,

12:09.797 --> 12:13.233
but we are never working
together again!

12:13.333 --> 12:15.135
- [loud thud]

12:15.235 --> 12:18.238
- Phoebe, I think you have
the answer to your problem.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.606
Max, come over here.

12:19.706 --> 12:20.908
- Oh, great idea.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.343
Give me Max's spot
in Sarah's group.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.812
- You're in a group
with Phoebe.

12:24.845 --> 12:29.817
Party of two!
Party of wahoo! Hoo! Hoo!

12:29.850 --> 12:32.052
- Try to get us at
least a "B", sis.

12:32.152 --> 12:35.055
I've gotta keep up
the old GPA. [laughing]

12:38.125 --> 12:40.460
- Honey, have you
seen my raincoat?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.595
- Uh, check the hall closet.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.298
- I was afraid you'd say that.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.300
[gasping]

12:49.636 --> 12:51.338
Uh, Barb?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.073
- What is it?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.548
When? How?

13:01.648 --> 13:04.985
What is happening?

13:05.085 --> 13:06.920
- You always wanted
a new bathroom,

13:07.020 --> 13:11.358
so me and Billy put in some
elbow grease and voilà!

13:11.458 --> 13:13.493
Toilet's self-flushing.
- [toilet flushing]

13:13.593 --> 13:15.963
- Enjoy!

13:16.629 --> 13:17.865
- This isn't fair.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.267
They're running the house
better than we can.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.636
They even hung the chandelier
you never got to.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.007
- Yeah, I wasn't
gonna hang that.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.876
- We cannot let
them win this bet.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.878
Can you imagine what
our lives will be like

13:30.911 --> 13:33.213
with them in charge.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.782
- [toy car horn honking]

13:39.086 --> 13:41.154
- How do you guys
like your new clothes?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.756
- We hate them.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.059
We can't leave the house
dressed like this.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.328
- You're not going anywhere
until you finish your dinner.

13:48.428 --> 13:52.365
- But we've had candy
every night this week.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.068
I've lost six teeth!

13:58.205 --> 14:00.540
- [gasping]
We can't let that happen.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.742
How will I chew steak?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.912
- We have to make sure
this house falls apart

14:04.945 --> 14:06.613
under their watch.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.016
- Way ahead of you.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.483
- [door handle clanking]

14:10.583 --> 14:14.121
- Aw, look what broke.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.960
- It's getting late, partner.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.962
Shouldn't you be knee-deep

14:22.062 --> 14:24.231
in some sort of
glitter 'n glue extravaganza?

14:24.331 --> 14:26.967
- I'm not gonna do
our project by myself.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.269
- Really? Because we both
know I'm not helping,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.171
so why don't you uncork
that overachieving,

14:31.271 --> 14:35.608
annoying beast that lurks inside
ya and get crackin'.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.745
- No, I'm gonna sit here
and do nothing until you help.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.780
- Are you? This is
gonna be good.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.316
[rapping table]

14:43.416 --> 14:47.387
I'm gonna have a snack
'n watch you crack.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.356
[chomping apple]

14:49.456 --> 14:59.632
- *

14:59.732 --> 15:02.602
- Oh! Fine! You win!

15:02.702 --> 15:03.803
- Finally!

15:03.971 --> 15:05.372
I'm sick of eating apples.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.307
- Do you wanna know
why I'm making

15:07.407 --> 15:08.976
Chinese food for our project?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.978
- Because my plan worked?

15:11.044 --> 15:12.545
- Because that's what
superheroes do.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.881
When they have a team, they pull
through for their team.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.716
Not that you would know
anything about that.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.552
- Really, superhero?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.554
If you hadn't been so anxious
to hang with Winnie,

15:21.654 --> 15:25.025
you'd still be in Sarah's group
and their dragon would be fine.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.060
- But you ruined their dragon.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.362
- I was only in Sarah's group
because you ditched them.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.631
- Typical Max.
"Wasn't my fault."

15:31.731 --> 15:34.467
- My motto since 2005.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.736
- This act of yours
is getting really old.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.173
You're not lazy, looking
for an easy "A", you're afraid.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.342
Isn't that why you became
a supervillain, 'cause you

15:42.442 --> 15:44.611
were afraid you couldn't be
a better superhero than me?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.146
Did you ever try?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.714
- I'm not even dignifying
that with a response--

15:47.814 --> 15:51.184
because I am lazy and because
you're holding a big knife.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.520
- Everything you do you are.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.022
It's because you're
afraid of failure.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.789
You think it's easier
not to try

15:56.889 --> 15:58.591
than to try and end
up failing.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.328
That should be your motto.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.130
[sighing]

16:03.230 --> 16:05.298
[powers zapping]

16:06.866 --> 16:08.768
- [water gurgling]

16:11.538 --> 16:12.939
- Ah!

16:13.040 --> 16:16.343
- Maybe you should focus more
on your food and less on me.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.746
- They're supposed
to do that.

16:19.846 --> 16:20.913
- They think they're so great

16:21.048 --> 16:22.682
because they can hang
a chandelier.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.185
Well, they're gonna
chandelier their pants

16:25.285 --> 16:28.055
when this comes crashing down.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.190
- [electrical zapping]

16:31.891 --> 16:33.626
- [laughing] Okay!

16:33.726 --> 16:36.963
I just scorched the flower
garden they planted.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.132
Let's see them grow
that back overnight.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.201
- Whoa, good job, honey!

16:41.301 --> 16:42.569
- What are you doing?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.537
- I just took this bolt
out of the chandelier.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.574
When the kids go
to clean it, boom!

16:47.674 --> 16:48.741
Brilliant, huh?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.077
- No, crazy!

16:50.143 --> 16:51.778
I just scorched a few tulips.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.313
You're gonna maim our children.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.882
- It's a learning
opportunity, Barb.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.085
- Hank...

16:58.151 --> 16:59.619
- Good morning.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.821
Final day of our bet.

17:01.921 --> 17:04.124
- What's with the ladder?

17:04.224 --> 17:07.260
- [sighing] All right.
I'll be honest with you.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.495
Your mom rigged the chandelier

17:08.595 --> 17:10.263
to make it fall
so you'd look bad.

17:10.363 --> 17:16.103
- Wow, you are so grounded
when we win this bet.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.637
- You guys did win the bet.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.406
You've been running this house
better than we have

17:19.506 --> 17:21.374
and making it look easy.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.276
- Seriously, you made
maple bacon.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.113
And I almost dropped a light
fixture on your head.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.648
I shouldn't be
the boss of anything.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.383
- Congratulations.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.386
- Hear that, Billy?
We're in charge now.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.123
Hank, Barb, clear out
the master bedroom.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.391
We're starting
a guinea pig farm.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.595
- Mom, Dad, wait.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.197
- Billy, what are you doing?

17:44.297 --> 17:45.932
- Sorry, Nora,
but we don't deserve

17:46.032 --> 17:49.236
to be guinea pig farmers.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.404
The truth is we tried
to do the housework,

17:51.504 --> 17:53.406
but you were right--
it was too hard.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.442
So we called some
of your old friends

17:55.542 --> 17:57.177
from Metroburg to help us.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.046
- Billy, no.
- Come on out, guys.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.649
- Maid of Honor?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.517
Handy Man.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.854
Oh, the Green Thumb!

18:07.954 --> 18:10.690
- Uh, stranger danger.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.693
- You guys were doing
all the work?

18:13.793 --> 18:15.061
- Yep.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.763
- Well, at least now we know

18:16.863 --> 18:19.166
it takes three superheroes
to take care of the house.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.501
- Four!

18:21.601 --> 18:24.237
- Iron Skillet made
the trip, too?

18:24.337 --> 18:27.174
- Up! Up! And filet!

18:27.207 --> 18:30.743
- I miss you guys so much.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.612
You the most.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.483
- Way to go, Billy.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.585
- I'm sorry, but what
we did was wrong.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.487
I'm just glad
no one got hurt.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.289
- [chandelier creaking,
crashing]

18:42.389 --> 18:43.790
- HANDY MAN: Oh!

18:43.890 --> 18:46.826
- I'm just glad
we didn't get hurt.

18:46.926 --> 18:53.065
- *

18:53.200 --> 18:54.501
- BILLY: [zooming]

18:54.601 --> 18:57.204
- Billy, you found one!
Oh, thank you so much.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.638
- Sorry I'm late.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.873
I got lost inside
the Great Mall of China.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.375
- It's real?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.344
- You're the one doing
the project on China.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.780
You should know these things.
[zooming]

19:13.586 --> 19:16.456
- This is the saddest
dragon ever.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.590
- I wish we had a better one.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.827
Oh, right, we did.

19:20.927 --> 19:24.096
- Oh, great, you and Max
stole our idea.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.265
Thanks a lot.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.899
- This is for you guys.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.702
- Like I said--thanks a lot.
[laughing]

19:32.239 --> 19:34.407
- Look, I should have been
in your group from the start.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.344
I messed up and let
you guys down.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.611
I'm sorry.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.748
- It's okay.
Thanks for saying something.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.851
To be honest, I miss you.
- PHOEBE: [laughing]

19:44.951 --> 19:48.688
- I wanna be the head!
- No, I want to!

19:48.788 --> 19:52.825
- I miss you so so much.
- PHOEBE: [laughing]

19:55.362 --> 19:57.029
- Sabrina's top
is made in China,

19:57.129 --> 20:00.433
as was Emma's shoes and my hair
tie and my purse and my phone.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.469
- Okay, that's enough.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.870
You girls get a "C".

20:03.970 --> 20:05.505
- Yes, a "C"!

20:05.605 --> 20:08.308
Daddy is getting me a new car!

20:08.408 --> 20:09.976
- PHOEBE: [sighing]

20:10.076 --> 20:11.978
- Maybe next time try
to go the extra mile--

20:12.078 --> 20:14.213
like Sarah's group
and their dragon.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.517
- ALL: Choo-choo!

20:17.617 --> 20:20.019
- Next up, Phoebe and Max.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.355
- Um, actually,
Max isn't here yet.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.891
- Well, as they say in China...

20:24.991 --> 20:26.793
tough noogies.

20:29.696 --> 20:34.133
- Um, okay, so Max and I wanted
to celebrate China

20:34.233 --> 20:37.737
by making egg rolls.
- [egg rolls thudding]

20:37.837 --> 20:40.607
- Uh, sorry, guys, they're...
they're still good.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.710
Uh, in China,
the five second rule

20:43.810 --> 20:46.513
is a ten second rule
due to the time difference.

20:46.613 --> 20:50.350
We're getting
an "F" aren't we?

20:50.450 --> 20:51.651
- [fireworks exploding]

20:51.751 --> 20:53.786
- Oh, my gosh, fireworks!

20:53.886 --> 20:56.756
- [fireworks continue]

21:02.329 --> 21:04.063
- Behold!

21:04.163 --> 21:06.533
One of China's oldest
traditions.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.134
Fireworks are used
in celebration,

21:08.234 --> 21:10.370
but were originally
used to scare off spirits

21:10.470 --> 21:13.673
and sisters who think they're
better than their brothers.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.076
- Max, you set off fireworks
on school grounds?

21:17.176 --> 21:19.746
- Phoebe and I did.
As a group.

21:19.846 --> 21:20.947
- Actually, Mrs. Austin--

21:21.047 --> 21:24.150
- I love it!
- That is exactly what we did.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.554
Max and I are in the same group
and this is our project.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.121
* Ta-da!

21:29.221 --> 21:31.691
- Well, what do the Chinese
characters say?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.926
- Uh...
- Don't be modest, Phoebe.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.195
It was Phoebe's idea to have
the fireworks spell out--

21:36.363 --> 21:39.932
"it's better to try and fail
than not try at all."

21:40.032 --> 21:43.436
- Yes! Yes!
The Thundermans get an "A"!

21:43.536 --> 21:46.138
- ALL: [applauding]

21:49.609 --> 21:50.977
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.545
I was up all night
twisting fuses

21:52.645 --> 21:54.514
and packing bootleg gunpowder.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.849
- Well, it was worth it.
Thank you.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.251
Now you can tell me what those
characters really spell out.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.621
- Oh, "Phoebe smells
like a wet donkey."

22:01.721 --> 22:03.423
- Clever.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.257
Egg roll?

22:05.392 --> 22:07.226
- Sure!

22:11.798 --> 22:27.914
- *
