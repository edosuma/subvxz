WEBVTT

00:02.154 --> 00:03.833
I came as soon as I got the call.

00:03.868 --> 00:04.862
What's going on?

00:04.896 --> 00:06.297
Sorry to pull you in this late.

00:06.331 --> 00:07.631
We just tracked down our perp.

00:07.666 --> 00:10.148
Lieutenant, this is
the doctor I mentioned.

00:10.252 --> 00:11.747
Yes. Forensic psychologist?

00:11.812 --> 00:12.870
That's right.

00:12.904 --> 00:14.071
Nice to meet you.

00:14.105 --> 00:15.306
Where's Crane?

00:15.340 --> 00:18.309
He's already interrogating
the suspect.

00:18.343 --> 00:20.811
What do you mean,
Crane's interrogating the suspect?

00:21.288 --> 00:23.812
We know you saw more
than you admitted.

00:24.182 --> 00:26.550
Tell us.
We mean you no harm.

00:26.585 --> 00:29.853
The suspect is obviously
teeing up an insanity defense.

00:29.888 --> 00:31.188
She's smart.

00:31.222 --> 00:33.324
She knows exactly what she's doing.

00:33.358 --> 00:34.858
She?

00:34.893 --> 00:37.027
Why is that?

00:37.062 --> 00:40.297
Why are you deceiving us?

00:40.332 --> 00:42.199
What did you see?

00:43.668 --> 00:45.436
Abbie!

00:46.404 --> 00:48.472
What is going on here?

00:48.506 --> 00:51.976
We finally caught Abigail Mills.
Mostly thanks to the good doctor here.

00:52.010 --> 00:56.246
Caught? I don't understand.
She didn't do anything wrong.

00:56.281 --> 00:57.281
Did she?

00:57.315 --> 00:59.850
I think you know
the answer to that.

01:04.289 --> 01:05.822
Stop lying, Abbie.

01:06.925 --> 01:09.293
The truth will set you free.

01:13.732 --> 01:15.532
Captain!

01:16.434 --> 01:18.248
The door's locked!

01:18.504 --> 01:20.222
Sir!

01:21.039 --> 01:23.207
Let me out of here!

01:23.241 --> 01:25.242
Someone let me out of here!

01:29.948 --> 01:32.549
Let me out! Let me out!

01:32.584 --> 01:33.748
Let me out!

01:33.820 --> 01:35.834
Let me out of here!

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.303 --> 01:53.804
This is Mills.

01:53.838 --> 01:55.205
Dispatch here.

01:55.240 --> 01:59.076
Emergency response has
requested you at 3rd and Main.

01:59.110 --> 02:00.277
On my way.

02:03.548 --> 02:05.516
What kind of dream?

02:05.550 --> 02:06.884
A really weird one.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.686
You were in it.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.120
Oh?

02:10.155 --> 02:13.090
And what, pray tell,
was I doing in your dream?

02:13.124 --> 02:15.092
Freaking me out
even more than usual.

02:15.126 --> 02:16.126
Mills.

02:16.161 --> 02:18.295
What's going on, Captain?

02:18.329 --> 02:20.230
Do you know a Dr. Mara Vega?

02:20.265 --> 02:21.265
No. Should I?

02:21.941 --> 02:24.891
We have our crisis responders
up there now trying to talk her down,

02:24.926 --> 02:27.637
but she doesn't want to speak to anyone
except, apparently, you.

02:28.540 --> 02:29.640
Why the lieutenant?

02:29.674 --> 02:32.176
That's what I need her
to find out.

02:45.890 --> 02:48.025
Dr. Vega?

02:50.662 --> 02:54.098
Lieutenant Abbie Mills.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.999
You wanted to speak to me?

02:56.034 --> 02:59.470
It was my fault.

02:59.504 --> 03:01.371
Everything she saw was real.

03:01.406 --> 03:05.542
I believed her and I lied.

03:05.577 --> 03:07.811
Should have told the truth.

03:07.846 --> 03:11.215
About what?
Who are you talking about, Doc?

03:11.249 --> 03:13.117
Your sister Jenny.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.126
It's my fault, Abbie.

03:21.593 --> 03:23.360
I deserve it.

03:23.394 --> 03:27.097
I've had this coming a long time.

03:27.647 --> 03:29.404
We all have.

03:32.137 --> 03:33.036
Wait... Don't!

03:50.789 --> 03:52.322
Are you all right?

03:52.357 --> 03:54.792
Yeah, I'm okay.

03:54.826 --> 03:56.126
What happened?

03:56.161 --> 03:59.163
I'm not sure. It was bizarre.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.731
It was really bizarre.

04:00.765 --> 04:02.966
Dr. Vega... It was like
she was sleepwalking,

04:03.001 --> 04:04.268
her mind was elsewhere,

04:04.302 --> 04:07.704
and her eyes...
they were glazed over white.

04:07.739 --> 04:08.772
Glazed white?

04:08.807 --> 04:11.742
Maybe she was prescribing herself
some sort of recreational drug.

04:11.776 --> 04:14.211
Didn't look like that or anything else
I've ever seen before.

04:14.245 --> 04:15.946
All the color was gone.

04:17.115 --> 04:20.236
Uh, medic, I'd like to see the body
before you remove it.

04:20.317 --> 04:21.821
I'd like to take a look
at her eyes.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.584
Yeah, sure.

04:25.757 --> 04:27.591
It presents as a massive cataract.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.293
No sign of trauma, no petechiae.

04:29.327 --> 04:30.060
Whoa!

04:32.964 --> 04:36.633
No one sees or goes near
this body until I say.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.863
You understand?

04:41.448 --> 04:45.129
1.03 - For the Triumph of Evil
Sync and corrected by <font color="#FF0000">Elderfel</font>
www.addic7ed.com

05:16.945 --> 05:18.746
What the hell is going on here?

05:18.780 --> 05:21.115
A complete stranger summons
Lieutenant Mills to her side

05:21.149 --> 05:22.783
before sleepwalking to her death.

05:22.817 --> 05:25.853
This after her eyes
somehow transmogrified

05:25.887 --> 05:28.255
into sand-filled orbs
of the purest white.

05:28.290 --> 05:31.291
- What else is going on, Lieutenant?
- She mentioned my sister, Jenny.

05:31.326 --> 05:34.394
She must have known her, maybe
that's how she knew who I was.

05:34.429 --> 05:35.729
Hang on a sec.

05:35.764 --> 05:39.466
Did your sister spend any time
at Tarrytown Psychiatric?

05:39.501 --> 05:40.901
First year she was committed, yeah.

05:40.935 --> 05:44.037
- Been in and out of there for years.
- Dr. Vega's one of the resident psychs.

05:44.072 --> 05:46.406
I'll get you all of her files.
See what you can dig up.

05:46.441 --> 05:49.009
In the meantime,
let's keep a lid on this.

05:49.043 --> 05:51.745
The last thing we need around here
is another episode of The Twilight Zone.

05:51.780 --> 05:53.046
Yes, sir.

05:58.620 --> 06:02.689
Care to share any additional information
you withheld from the captain?

06:02.724 --> 06:04.525
You know the nightmare I had?

06:04.559 --> 06:06.026
You were in it,

06:06.060 --> 06:09.596
so was the requisite faceless
nightmare monster, but...

06:09.631 --> 06:11.031
Vega was there, too.

06:11.065 --> 06:14.034
Except that is impossible
because I have never met her before.

06:14.068 --> 06:16.904
I think our definition of possible
has been irrevocably broadened.

06:17.806 --> 06:19.206
You had a prophetic dream

06:19.240 --> 06:21.408
warning you of an impending event.

06:21.442 --> 06:22.776
Which stands to reason,

06:22.811 --> 06:25.412
given that, according
to Washington's Bible...

06:25.446 --> 06:29.516
The Book of Revelation foretells
of two witnesses, I know.

06:29.551 --> 06:31.718
I am a cop in a small town.

06:31.753 --> 06:35.589
So let's not curse me
as a capital "W" witness just yet.

06:35.623 --> 06:38.859
Consider what you just saw.
This isn't simply a suicide.

06:38.893 --> 06:42.362
This pertains to the seven years
of tribulations.

06:42.397 --> 06:44.392
The creature in your nightmare...

06:44.427 --> 06:46.046
I barely saw it.

06:46.081 --> 06:48.969
Perhaps it is the true cause
of the doctor's death.

06:49.003 --> 06:52.372
A soldier in the army of evil
sent against us.

06:52.407 --> 06:55.442
Against you,
the capital "W" witness.

06:55.476 --> 06:58.412
Maybe. But unless you have

06:58.446 --> 07:01.782
an encyclopedia of
faceless nightmare monsters,

07:01.816 --> 07:03.617
why don't we just start
with a little regular

07:03.651 --> 07:06.153
detective work here?

07:07.422 --> 07:11.124
One more time.
From the beginning, Jenny.

07:11.159 --> 07:13.126
I saw a demon.

07:13.161 --> 07:16.663
I heard a voice say,
"Come and see."

07:16.698 --> 07:19.533
Then...
I wasn't in the forest anymore.

07:19.567 --> 07:21.268
Where do you think you were?

07:24.339 --> 07:27.407
Listen to this...
Vega's private notes.

07:27.442 --> 07:30.351
"Jenny exhibits
no other signs of delusion."

07:32.280 --> 07:34.281
What did you do?

07:36.684 --> 07:39.186
Sorry. Continue.

07:39.220 --> 07:40.921
"The better I get to know her,

07:40.955 --> 07:43.136
the more I believe
she's telling the truth."

07:43.168 --> 07:45.493
There are at least three
other similar mentions.

07:45.528 --> 07:47.361
Vega knew
that Jenny wasn't crazy.

07:47.395 --> 07:49.296
Yet she allowed her
to remain institutionalized,

07:49.330 --> 07:51.632
presumably from fear of censure.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.834
Believe me, fear is a
pretty powerful motivator.

07:53.868 --> 07:56.203
Fear causes inaction.
Inaction causes pain.

07:56.237 --> 07:58.305
QED, fear causes pain.

07:58.339 --> 08:01.942
I'll grant it's a syllogism,
but you get my meaning.

08:01.976 --> 08:04.444
Vega feels responsible
for keeping Jenny committed.

08:04.479 --> 08:07.481
The guilt eats her up inside
until she can't take it anymore.

08:07.515 --> 08:09.316
She seeks me out for
some kind of absolution,

08:09.350 --> 08:13.186
then jumps.
QED, case closed.

08:13.221 --> 08:15.455
You're forgetting about
the doctor's white eyes.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.624
About the sand
that poured from them

08:17.659 --> 08:20.394
and your prophetic dream
about Dr. Vega.

08:20.428 --> 08:22.562
And Vega's last words.

08:22.597 --> 08:26.066
Before she jumped,
she said that she had it coming.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.302
"We" have it coming.

08:28.336 --> 08:30.304
And you question that
this death has to do

08:30.338 --> 08:31.638
with your role as a witness?

08:31.673 --> 08:34.174
Fine. Let's say that
this is some evil minion

08:34.207 --> 08:37.510
sent after us
by the demon in the woods.

08:37.544 --> 08:38.979
What does it want?

08:39.013 --> 08:40.580
Why hurt Dr. Vega,

08:40.615 --> 08:42.849
and what do I have to do
with any of it?

08:42.884 --> 08:45.152
My best guess is the enemy
wants what all enemies want.

08:45.186 --> 08:47.362
To thwart his opponent.

08:47.397 --> 08:49.256
Clearly you're a threat to him

08:49.290 --> 08:50.857
as is your sister.

08:50.892 --> 08:53.694
- We must speak to her at once.
- No, it's not happening.

08:53.728 --> 08:57.064
I understand you've not spoken
to your sister in some time, but...

08:57.098 --> 08:58.365
We don't talk, period.

08:58.399 --> 09:00.567
What time doesn't change,
death will, don't you suppose?

09:00.601 --> 09:03.971
Now, I'd rather keep
the latter at bay.

09:05.873 --> 09:07.908
Okay.

09:07.942 --> 09:09.843
You want to see her?
Let's go.

09:09.877 --> 09:12.112
See for yourself.

09:23.791 --> 09:25.025
This is pointless.

09:25.059 --> 09:27.294
All of our personal issues aside,

09:27.328 --> 09:30.764
she's not gonna help me
because I'm a cop and she's a criminal.

09:30.798 --> 09:33.900
- Oh, she's a criminal now?
- Do you know why she's locked up in here?

09:33.935 --> 09:35.802
She broke
into a sporting goods store

09:35.837 --> 09:39.873
and stole a bunch of survival gear,
over 4,000 bucks' worth of stuff.

09:39.907 --> 09:41.708
Does your current
law enforcement incarcerate

09:41.743 --> 09:43.377
all thieves in sanatoriums?

09:43.411 --> 09:45.645
She told the cops
that she needed it

09:45.680 --> 09:48.982
because she was preparing
for the End of Days.

09:49.017 --> 09:51.585
Oh, well,
she's perfectly sane, then.

09:58.592 --> 10:01.465
Lieutenant Abbie Mills
to see Jennifer Mills.

10:02.197 --> 10:05.065
- I'm her sister.
- I didn't know Jenny had a sister.

10:05.099 --> 10:06.800
She does.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.802
One second.

10:08.836 --> 10:10.776
Extension 49, please.

10:11.773 --> 10:15.409
Don't be afraid of number 49, Abbie.

10:15.443 --> 10:18.311
When was the last time
you saw your sister?

10:18.346 --> 10:21.782
I'm sorry.
Saw or talked to?

10:23.968 --> 10:27.605
Last time I saw her was
back row of a county courthouse

10:27.645 --> 10:29.900
five years ago
when she was arrested

10:29.935 --> 10:31.591
for breaking and entering
the first time.

10:31.626 --> 10:34.995
I tried to offer to help.
It's complicated.

10:35.029 --> 10:38.165
I'm sorry, Miss Mills,
but Jenny doesn't want to talk to you.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.934
Thank you.

10:40.968 --> 10:43.904
You're an officer of the law.

10:43.938 --> 10:46.006
Is she not obligated
to speak to you?

10:46.040 --> 10:48.031
I could force the issue
and make Jenny talk to me,

10:48.069 --> 10:50.625
but that isn't gonna get us
what we need.

10:51.479 --> 10:54.013
Would you be amenable
to my speaking with her?

10:54.949 --> 10:57.918
If she's amenable.
Sure, knock yourself out.

10:57.952 --> 11:01.188
Would you, again, please?

11:10.731 --> 11:13.500
Thank you for seeing me,
Miss Mills.

11:20.541 --> 11:22.742
Curiosity got the best of me.

11:24.178 --> 11:26.980
Who are you?
Abbie's new boyfriend?

11:27.014 --> 11:30.617
We are amicable,
and yes, I am male,

11:30.651 --> 11:33.553
but I suspect you're
implying something else.

11:33.588 --> 11:36.022
What's your name,
tall, dark and British?

11:36.057 --> 11:38.385
My name is Ichabod Crane.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.286
What do your friends call you?

11:42.730 --> 11:43.730
"Icky"?

11:43.764 --> 11:46.600
Not if they wish
to remain my friends.

11:46.634 --> 11:47.934
Hmm.

11:47.969 --> 11:49.736
Sense of humor, too.

11:51.072 --> 11:52.939
I've seen
the demon in the woods.

11:52.974 --> 11:56.009
The one you and your sister
saw as children.

11:58.179 --> 12:00.180
Shh...

12:01.549 --> 12:04.851
They lock you up in here
when you talk crazy.

12:06.287 --> 12:09.890
That's why I'm in here
and she's out there.

12:11.125 --> 12:13.026
Hmm.

12:13.060 --> 12:14.528
She didn't tell you, did she?

12:14.562 --> 12:16.229
Ask her.

12:16.264 --> 12:17.764
Make her tell you
all the dirty details.

12:17.798 --> 12:20.133
I wonder what you'll think of her
once you know.

12:23.504 --> 12:26.606
I'm afraid I have
some regrettable news.

12:26.641 --> 12:29.109
Your former doctor, Dr. Vega,

12:29.143 --> 12:31.611
tragically leapt to
her death last night.

12:35.183 --> 12:36.550
I'm very sorry.

12:37.785 --> 12:40.353
Your sister was the last person
she spoke to.

12:40.388 --> 12:43.256
The doctor said,
"We've all got it coming."

12:44.025 --> 12:45.659
What did she mean?

12:45.693 --> 12:47.160
I don't know.

12:47.195 --> 12:48.762
You do know there are
things in Sleepy Hollow

12:48.796 --> 12:49.930
that are not of this realm.

12:49.964 --> 12:52.666
What do you think could
have killed the doctor?

12:54.035 --> 12:55.001
It's time to go.

12:55.036 --> 12:56.736
The Four Horsemen are coming.

12:56.771 --> 12:58.104
You're a liar.

12:58.139 --> 12:59.406
The first is already here.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.075
He beheaded Sheriff Corbin
and Reverend Knapp

13:02.109 --> 13:03.977
before he fled from us.

13:04.011 --> 13:06.446
You're not menteinsana,
Miss Mills.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.350
I don't believe you are.
Neither does your sister.

13:19.660 --> 13:23.263
If you mean what you say...

13:23.297 --> 13:26.132
then you know there's
not much I can do for you.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.134
You already know what I do.

13:28.169 --> 13:30.770
Help us fight
the Horsemen's army.

13:30.805 --> 13:31.805
Help you?

13:34.141 --> 13:36.209
It's all over but the crying.

13:37.645 --> 13:38.645
My conscience is clear.

13:41.015 --> 13:43.948
Ask Abbie
if she can say the same.

13:51.856 --> 13:53.856
Lieutenant, please.

13:53.890 --> 13:56.359
What's the cause of this rift
between you and Miss Jenny?

13:56.393 --> 13:58.194
I told you, it's complicated.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.996
I was born more
than two centuries ago,

14:00.030 --> 14:03.199
and my wife is prisoner
in some otherworldly realm.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.334
I'm no stranger to complications.

14:05.369 --> 14:07.975
Miss Mills, stop.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.860
What happened with you and your sister
is between you and your sister.

14:11.895 --> 14:15.072
But your secret is in the way
of a truth we must uncover.

14:15.107 --> 14:18.547
The consequences
of keeping this secret could be dire.

14:21.251 --> 14:24.372
I'm gonna trust you
with something

14:24.407 --> 14:26.286
that I've never told anybody.

14:26.321 --> 14:29.158
Not a shrink, not a priest,
not Sheriff Corbin.

14:30.793 --> 14:33.462
When Jenny and I saw
that thing in the woods...

14:37.700 --> 14:38.967
I remember waking up.

14:40.803 --> 14:43.906
Felt like I'd only been
asleep a few minutes.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.742
Apparently,
it had been four days.

14:48.011 --> 14:49.945
And the whole town had
been looking for us.

14:55.251 --> 14:57.317
What the...?

14:57.921 --> 14:59.454
I found them!

14:59.489 --> 15:00.756
Hey, over here!

15:04.460 --> 15:05.827
They asked a lot of questions

15:05.862 --> 15:07.496
I didn't want to answer.

15:07.530 --> 15:09.965
Someone else was in the woods.
Can you describe him?

15:09.999 --> 15:13.068
I told Jenny,
"Don't say anything.

15:13.102 --> 15:14.668
Follow my lead."

15:14.738 --> 15:16.271
She didn't listen.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.507
A man...

15:18.541 --> 15:21.310
come out of the ground.

15:21.344 --> 15:23.011
She told him about what we saw.

15:24.781 --> 15:26.381
She told him I saw it.

15:26.958 --> 15:29.818
And that the rancher who found us
saw it, too.

15:29.852 --> 15:33.496
When she was done,
the doctor turned to me.

15:33.531 --> 15:35.332
Abbie...

15:35.425 --> 15:38.694
did you see this...
thing, as well?

15:40.096 --> 15:41.897
No, I didn't see anything.

15:41.931 --> 15:43.832
- Abbie!
- It's all right, Jenny.

15:43.866 --> 15:44.967
She's lying!

15:45.001 --> 15:47.430
- I didn't see anything.
- Why are you lying?

15:47.465 --> 15:50.672
- I'm not. I didn't see anything.
- Why... Abbie. Tell them what you saw.

15:50.707 --> 15:51.673
Tell them what...

15:51.708 --> 15:53.875
Don't touch me!

15:53.910 --> 15:55.577
Tell them what you saw, Abbie!

15:55.612 --> 15:57.613
Tell them!

16:02.485 --> 16:05.020
I told Jenny to keep her
mouth shut about what we saw.

16:05.054 --> 16:06.655
Our parents
were out of the picture,

16:06.689 --> 16:08.991
we finally landed in
a decent foster home...

16:09.025 --> 16:11.360
Your parents were...
"out of the picture."

16:11.394 --> 16:12.394
That is a story for another day.

16:12.428 --> 16:13.562
The point is,

16:13.596 --> 16:15.197
we would have been
in enough trouble

16:15.231 --> 16:17.265
if they found out that
we were in the woods

16:17.300 --> 16:19.368
sneaking beers after school.

16:19.402 --> 16:21.036
But if we started
talking about demons

16:21.070 --> 16:24.439
and all that, I told her we would
be put back in the system.

16:24.474 --> 16:25.741
So you said nothing.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.209
Like she should have.

16:27.243 --> 16:28.844
And you were allowed to stay

16:28.878 --> 16:31.113
in the foster home
while she was relocated.

16:33.583 --> 16:34.816
You were afraid.

16:34.851 --> 16:36.251
You lied because you were afraid.

16:36.285 --> 16:38.453
Not only of the creature

16:38.488 --> 16:40.756
but of the earthly consequences
of your tale.

16:40.790 --> 16:43.792
But you do realize there's no need
to be frightened still.

16:43.826 --> 16:45.193
- Sorry?
- You were frightened then,

16:45.228 --> 16:46.795
you still are today.

16:46.829 --> 16:48.730
- Of what?
- Of admitting the truth.

16:48.765 --> 16:50.799
That you turned your back
on Miss Jenny.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.337
Look, you're right.

16:55.371 --> 16:57.539
What's between me and my sister

16:57.573 --> 17:00.242
is between me and my sister.

17:03.112 --> 17:05.213
She told the doctor
that you saw the demon,

17:05.248 --> 17:07.915
and the rancher who found you
saw it as well.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.050
Mr. Gillespie?

17:10.118 --> 17:12.186
Yeah.

17:12.221 --> 17:13.835
He never admitted to seeing anything.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.175
Probably because
it would have cost him

17:15.282 --> 17:19.372
the 15 minutes of fame
he got from being a small-town hero.

17:19.628 --> 17:20.962
But he knew.

17:20.997 --> 17:22.329
He never told.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.767
We should pay Mr. Gillespie
a visit.

18:09.947 --> 18:12.172
Ow.

18:21.691 --> 18:23.692
Paige?

18:25.761 --> 18:28.162
Is that you?

19:03.130 --> 19:05.136
Who hung this in my office?

19:08.938 --> 19:11.006
Five people are dead,

19:11.040 --> 19:12.574
including two of your own.

19:12.608 --> 19:14.442
And you think, just
because you heard a rumor

19:14.477 --> 19:16.378
about a headless horseman
running around town,

19:16.412 --> 19:19.281
it's all a big joke?

19:22.351 --> 19:24.052
Yeah, it was me, sir.

19:24.086 --> 19:26.788
It's just a stupid prank.

19:26.823 --> 19:29.791
You know, something we do
when someone new joins the force.

19:39.101 --> 19:41.436
Good one.

19:43.773 --> 19:45.140
Morales, right?

19:45.174 --> 19:46.341
Yes, sir.

19:47.176 --> 19:49.110
You used to date Lieutenant Mills.

19:49.145 --> 19:51.646
Yeah, how'd you know that, sir?

19:51.681 --> 19:54.115
Assume I know everything.

19:55.251 --> 19:57.069
Captain, we've got a report

19:57.111 --> 19:59.330
of shots fired at the Gillespie ranch
on Pine Road.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.623
- Tactical's en route.
- Copy that.

20:01.657 --> 20:03.991
If you need me,
I'll be at the Gillespie ranch.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.945
Captain, what's going on?

20:18.980 --> 20:21.276
What are you two doing here?
I didn't call you.

20:21.349 --> 20:24.238
Seems our investigation
has dovetailed with yours, sir.

20:24.273 --> 20:25.826
What's going on?

20:25.861 --> 20:28.650
We got a report
of shots fired inside the house.

20:28.684 --> 20:29.620
Just pulled up.

20:29.658 --> 20:31.278
Found ourselves in a
full-on hostage situation.

20:31.388 --> 20:34.155
The suspect has his wife at gunpoint,
won't talk to anybody.

20:34.190 --> 20:36.258
I take it the suspect's name
is Gillespie.

20:36.492 --> 20:40.340
Captain, Mr. Gillespie is asking
to speak to a Lieutenant Mills.

20:41.497 --> 20:42.998
This seems familiar.

20:43.032 --> 20:44.332
You got this?

20:44.367 --> 20:45.367
I got it.

20:50.072 --> 20:52.065
Lieutenant Mills is coming in.

20:52.140 --> 20:54.116
Copy that. In position.

21:16.966 --> 21:19.768
Mr. Gillespie?

21:22.905 --> 21:24.139
Mr. Gillespie?

21:24.173 --> 21:28.042
It's Abigail Mills
from the sheriff's department.

21:32.882 --> 21:34.316
Mr. Gillespie.

22:04.580 --> 22:07.082
Mr. Gillespie?

22:07.116 --> 22:10.852
Stay out.
He's lost his mind.

22:13.522 --> 22:16.458
Mr. Gillespie,
you wanted to talk to me?

22:16.992 --> 22:20.328
Mr. Gillespie,
I'm here to help you.

22:20.363 --> 22:22.263
Let me help you.

22:27.570 --> 22:30.605
You can't help me.

22:30.639 --> 22:32.640
Sure I can.

22:35.244 --> 22:36.711
Let's just talk.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.453
Send in tactical now!

22:48.858 --> 22:50.558
Crane!

22:54.263 --> 22:56.097
Stand by, Captain.

22:56.132 --> 22:57.599
- Hold the team.
- Stand down.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.567
Stand down.
We're standing down.

22:59.602 --> 23:03.304
We are just fine here,
aren't we, Mr. Gillespie?

23:09.211 --> 23:12.013
Mr. Gillespie?

23:12.048 --> 23:14.349
You're gonna let me help you.

23:14.383 --> 23:17.285
You can't help me.

23:18.421 --> 23:20.522
He's coming for you next.

23:22.358 --> 23:24.192
Who is?
Who's coming for me?

23:24.226 --> 23:26.594
The Sandman.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.433
Next time you fall asleep...

23:32.623 --> 23:34.372
you're dead.

23:37.206 --> 23:39.974
No!

23:52.003 --> 23:55.005
Is there a reason
why you're standing alone?

23:55.039 --> 23:56.873
Far removed from everybody else?

23:56.908 --> 23:59.409
I'm trying to think.

23:59.443 --> 24:01.444
You know,
this isn't your fault either.

24:01.479 --> 24:03.146
I know.

24:03.181 --> 24:06.249
Just wish
I could've done something.

24:06.284 --> 24:07.818
You did your best.

24:08.853 --> 24:11.388
You were right about Jenny.

24:11.422 --> 24:13.156
She's the key to all of this.

24:13.191 --> 24:15.325
Dr. Vega, Mr. Gillespie, me.

24:15.359 --> 24:16.593
None of us did anything
to help her

24:16.627 --> 24:19.596
even though we knew
she was telling the truth.

24:21.299 --> 24:23.567
Mr. Gillespie said that I was next.

24:26.170 --> 24:28.138
The next time I fell asleep...

24:28.172 --> 24:29.439
I'm dead.

24:29.473 --> 24:32.309
The Sandman was coming
to get me.

24:32.343 --> 24:34.010
Who's the Sandman?

24:34.045 --> 24:35.278
Really?

24:35.313 --> 24:37.581
The, uh...

24:37.615 --> 24:41.284
kindly dream giver who sprinkles
sand in the eyes of children.

24:41.319 --> 24:42.285
Put 'em to sleep.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.820
Sounds barbaric.

24:45.156 --> 24:47.624
What does the Sandman look like?

24:47.658 --> 24:49.593
I don't know.

24:49.627 --> 24:51.328
The Sandman.

24:51.362 --> 24:52.696
Is he perhaps a-a...

24:52.730 --> 24:54.497
How did you put it?

24:54.532 --> 24:56.933
Faceless nightmare monster?

24:56.968 --> 24:59.636
The one from my dream.

25:01.739 --> 25:04.307
Crane, I think I found something.

25:04.342 --> 25:06.776
I requested coffee from the
charwoman in the entrance hall,

25:06.811 --> 25:09.779
but she said you're particular
to this beverage.

25:09.814 --> 25:11.448
She's called a receptionist.

25:11.482 --> 25:13.183
Or Wendy.

25:13.217 --> 25:14.384
And yes, I am.

25:14.418 --> 25:17.888
It's an energy drink
to help keep you awake.

25:17.922 --> 25:19.923
It'll keep me awake.

25:30.968 --> 25:33.269
Potent.

25:34.438 --> 25:35.972
I'm fine, I'm all right.

25:36.007 --> 25:38.241
Uh, so... you were saying?

25:38.276 --> 25:39.743
You have found something.

25:39.777 --> 25:41.511
Yes and no.

25:41.545 --> 25:43.580
Basically, dream spirits

25:43.614 --> 25:46.149
have been around as long
as humans have been dreaming.

25:46.183 --> 25:47.711
They're mostly easygoing types.

25:47.753 --> 25:50.038
Along the lines
of the traditional Sandman.

25:50.073 --> 25:52.589
But there's others.

25:52.623 --> 25:55.191
Less friendly. Vengeful types.

25:57.528 --> 25:59.763
Does this mean anything to you?

25:59.797 --> 26:03.266
It's from an 18th century Mohawk story
about a dream demon.

26:03.301 --> 26:05.101
Ro'kenhrontyes.

26:05.136 --> 26:06.336
You know him?

26:07.705 --> 26:09.819
The creature in your nightmare,

26:09.854 --> 26:12.375
did he have
black hollow eye sockets?

26:14.478 --> 26:15.879
Yeah, he did.

26:15.913 --> 26:17.781
And a veil of flesh
where his mouth should be?

26:17.815 --> 26:20.050
- Who is he?
- A myth.

26:20.084 --> 26:23.887
Clearly one
that's become all too real.

26:23.921 --> 26:27.557
I first heard of it from the Mohawks
who fought with us in the 37th regiment.

26:27.591 --> 26:30.126
You fought
alongside Native Americans?

26:30.161 --> 26:33.930
Fought, plotted, executed
various forms of espionage.

26:33.965 --> 26:36.875
Many of our Mohawk friends
were colonist spies.

26:36.910 --> 26:39.502
They could infiltrate
the ranks of the crown

26:39.537 --> 26:42.105
without anyone thinking
twice about their presence.

26:42.139 --> 26:45.108
They were invaluable to the cause.

26:50.247 --> 26:52.172
They told me a fairy tale,

26:52.215 --> 26:55.844
a legend spun to frighten the young
into a life of righteousness.

26:55.854 --> 26:57.738
"Always do right by
your neighbor, children,

26:57.772 --> 27:01.333
"or the spirit of Ro'kenhrontyes
will come for you in your dreams."

27:01.426 --> 27:03.262
Native Americans
would draw the symbol

27:03.337 --> 27:06.519
in the way we would make
the sign of the cross to ward away evil.

27:07.169 --> 27:10.435
Wiroh claimed that the dream spirit
killed his father as punishment

27:10.469 --> 27:13.905
for turning a blind eye
on his neighbor's plight.

27:19.010 --> 27:21.411
So if this...

27:21.445 --> 27:23.079
dream demon...

27:23.114 --> 27:26.916
is responsible for Vega and Gillespie
and is coming for me,

27:26.951 --> 27:28.018
what do I do?

27:28.052 --> 27:30.086
I carve this symbol in my doorstep?

27:30.121 --> 27:32.689
Only if you believe crossing yourself
will actually keep the Devil at bay.

27:32.723 --> 27:34.057
Look, I do not want

27:34.091 --> 27:37.427
to die because of something
I did over ten years ago.

27:37.461 --> 27:38.528
Okay.

27:38.562 --> 27:40.730
We must visit a Mohawk shaman.

27:41.932 --> 27:43.333
That's easier said than done.

27:43.367 --> 27:44.334
How so?

27:44.368 --> 27:45.902
After the Revolution,

27:45.936 --> 27:47.871
the new government
and the Native Americans

27:47.905 --> 27:49.639
fought over land.

27:49.673 --> 27:51.841
There aren't very many
of them left anymore.

27:51.876 --> 27:53.610
How is that possible?

27:53.644 --> 27:55.945
Their nation stretched the continent.

27:55.980 --> 27:58.915
Their rules for governments
formed the very basis

27:58.949 --> 28:01.551
of how we planned
to unify 13 diverse states

28:01.585 --> 28:02.986
in a single federation.

28:04.488 --> 28:06.089
They were my friends.

28:06.123 --> 28:08.158
Maybe this dream spirit
has a long

28:08.192 --> 28:11.594
list of people to visit
after he's done with me.

28:13.264 --> 28:14.397
A shaman.

28:14.432 --> 28:16.933
Is there a place we can find one?

28:16.967 --> 28:19.602
There is a guy.

28:19.637 --> 28:22.439
I don't think it's
what you're expecting.

28:22.473 --> 28:24.274
♪ Bung, bung, bung, bung, bung ♪

28:24.308 --> 28:26.176
♪ Bung, bung, bung,
bung, bung, bung ♪

28:26.210 --> 28:27.277
♪ Mr. Sandman ♪

28:27.311 --> 28:30.213
♪ Bring me a dream ♪

28:30.247 --> 28:31.414
♪ Bung, bung, bung, bung ♪

28:31.449 --> 28:32.816
♪ Make him the cutest... ♪

28:32.850 --> 28:36.252
The shaman sells
motorized carriages.

28:36.287 --> 28:38.321
Trucks, motorcycles,

28:38.355 --> 28:41.558
RVs, boats, a little bit of everything.

28:41.592 --> 28:43.159
Welcome to Geronimotors.

28:43.194 --> 28:46.463
Seamus Duncan, owner, manager,
and your humble servant.

28:46.497 --> 28:48.131
Lieutenant Abbie Mills.

28:48.165 --> 28:50.366
This is my partner Ichabod Crane.

28:50.401 --> 28:54.003
Sheriff said I had 90 days to clean up
the environmental waste in the back.

28:54.038 --> 28:54.971
We're not here about that.

28:55.005 --> 28:56.239
Great. Hey.

28:56.273 --> 28:57.707
You guys into time travel?

28:57.741 --> 29:00.410
I got a tricked-out DeLorean
in mint condition.

29:00.444 --> 29:02.946
We need your help...

29:02.980 --> 29:04.547
Combating the dream spirit.

29:04.582 --> 29:07.584
Ro'kenhrontyes.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.621
Seriously?

29:11.655 --> 29:14.824
You want me to go all kemosabe
and cast a spell

29:14.859 --> 29:16.159
and do a rain dance?

29:16.193 --> 29:17.894
Get out of here, you jokers.

29:17.928 --> 29:19.496
It's no joke.

29:19.530 --> 29:21.831
We wouldn't be here
if we weren't serious.

29:21.866 --> 29:24.100
He has visited her.

29:24.135 --> 29:26.569
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:26.604 --> 29:29.506
You want to buy a car?
I'm your man.

29:29.540 --> 29:32.108
Otherwise I can't help you.

29:40.513 --> 29:42.513
You understood everything I said.

29:42.547 --> 29:46.050
I recognized the fear in your countenance
when I mentioned Ro'kenhrontyes.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.219
He is coming for my friend.

29:48.253 --> 29:50.254
What will you do
when he comes for you?

29:52.658 --> 29:55.459
My conscience is clear.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.961
His Honor Edmund Burke
once said,

29:56.995 --> 29:59.363
"The only thing necessary
for the triumph of evil

29:59.398 --> 30:01.565
is for good men to do nothing."

30:01.600 --> 30:07.238
And we may all at times
stand idly when action is required.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.540
But if you turn your back
on Lieutenant Mills,

30:09.574 --> 30:11.075
how will you acquit yourself
a good man

30:11.109 --> 30:15.646
when Ro'kenhrontyes comes
to you in your dreams.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.386
Come on.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.023
I don't know
where you came from,

30:26.058 --> 30:28.459
but you can drop your
"friend of the tribe" stick.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.961
No one's a chief,
no one lives in teepees,

30:30.996 --> 30:32.763
and no one has powwows.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.065
Got it?

30:34.099 --> 30:36.233
You stopped having powwows?

30:36.268 --> 30:38.335
I rather enjoyed those.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.904
Get in.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.238
Where are we going?

30:41.273 --> 30:43.774
We're taking a little trip.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.844
First things first.

30:46.878 --> 30:50.247
Ro'kenhrontyes isn't your
run-of-the-mill demon.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.616
There's run-of-the-mill demons?

30:52.651 --> 30:54.118
Fair.

30:54.152 --> 30:56.954
Anyway,
he doesn't just want to kill you.

30:56.988 --> 30:59.290
He taunts you first.

30:59.324 --> 31:02.026
He rubs your face
in the mess you made.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.528
He drives you to a pain
so unimaginable,

31:04.563 --> 31:06.397
you willingly take your own life.

31:06.431 --> 31:09.600
Ergo...
Dr. Vega and Mr. Gillespie.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.036
And into the valley of death we go.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.572
The good pass through
on their way to Heaven.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.707
The evil go straight to Hell.

31:16.742 --> 31:20.911
Those in between,
they belong to Ro'kenhrontyes.

31:20.946 --> 31:24.448
If they're not redeemed,
he takes their souls to Hell with him.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.983
But I can't stop him?

31:26.017 --> 31:27.551
Only on his territory.

31:27.586 --> 31:31.088
You drink that tea,
you enter his dreamworld.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.157
Then the fight begins.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.798
Down the hatch.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.104
Once you enter the dreamworld,

31:47.139 --> 31:50.040
the spirit chooses the
challenge you have to face.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.742
You're a living being

31:51.777 --> 31:53.611
walking in the valley of death.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.079
So...

31:55.113 --> 31:56.814
If she dies in the dream?

31:56.848 --> 31:59.116
She dies. Period.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.252
I see.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.225
Crane!

32:09.961 --> 32:12.329
Jasmine.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.798
Cherry root.

32:14.900 --> 32:15.833
Hops?

32:15.867 --> 32:17.468
Not bad.

32:17.502 --> 32:20.104
It's certainly preferable
to your energy drink.

32:20.138 --> 32:21.505
What are you thinking?

32:21.540 --> 32:26.477
Well, I'm coming with you now,
so no point in discussing it.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.746
The tea will put you to sleep.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.016
The venom will allow you to control
your actions while you dream.

32:33.852 --> 32:36.754
It's the venom.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.874
What-what venom?

32:39.772 --> 32:41.233
Their venom.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.437
Is this strictly necessary?

32:53.471 --> 32:54.471
So you don't hurt yourselves.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.539
Scorpion stings...

32:55.574 --> 32:58.509
they're, um...

32:58.543 --> 32:59.677
ouch.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.380
You have to focus now.

33:03.415 --> 33:06.951
Once you enter the dreamworld,
the tea will keep you connected.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.453
But only you will know
what you have to do

33:09.487 --> 33:11.121
to defeat Ro'kenhrontyes.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.994
Is that necessary,
the banging?

33:28.240 --> 33:29.940
Lieutenant!

33:33.945 --> 33:36.080
Crane?

33:42.502 --> 33:44.162
Crane?

33:44.506 --> 33:46.156
Lieutenant!

34:43.514 --> 34:48.393
The imagination...
It is, uh, it's a powerful thing, Jenny.

34:48.428 --> 34:52.089
What you actually saw
was-was likely

34:52.123 --> 34:54.391
an animal or a hunter.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.560
What we saw was a demon!

34:58.530 --> 34:59.897
Tell him.

35:04.769 --> 35:08.939
Did you see this monster, Abbie?

35:11.142 --> 35:14.812
Yes, she did.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.680
Tell him.

35:41.498 --> 35:44.233
I've had this coming a long time.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.130
We all have.

35:46.165 --> 35:48.668
He's coming for you next.

35:59.317 --> 36:01.417
Tell them what you saw.

36:08.258 --> 36:10.026
I didn't see anything.

36:11.362 --> 36:13.696
She's lying.

36:13.730 --> 36:15.698
Why are you lying?!

36:17.234 --> 36:18.149
I didn't see anything!

36:18.188 --> 36:20.685
Tell them what you saw!
Abbie?

36:22.739 --> 36:24.602
Why are you lying?!

36:24.916 --> 36:26.978
Tell them what you saw, Abbie!

36:27.043 --> 36:28.634
Don't touch me!

36:29.966 --> 36:32.178
Tell them what you saw!

36:32.883 --> 36:35.551
Abbie, what's wrong with you?!

36:37.417 --> 36:41.123
Desist, Ro'kenhrontyes!

36:45.194 --> 36:46.912
Ichabod Crane.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.974
Leave her be!

37:10.854 --> 37:12.755
Stop!

37:14.657 --> 37:18.627
I saw... a demon.

37:19.529 --> 37:24.633
I saw a demon in the woods
and I lied to protect myself.

37:26.971 --> 37:29.644
I was a coward
and I betrayed my sister.

37:30.855 --> 37:34.867
I turned my back on her
when she needed me.

37:34.905 --> 37:37.727
And I will not do it again.

37:40.484 --> 37:42.226
It was my fault.

37:42.518 --> 37:44.893
You can come at me
all you want,

37:45.288 --> 37:48.023
but I see you.

37:48.425 --> 37:51.827
I'm not afraid anymore!

37:55.099 --> 37:56.765
Lieutenant.

38:13.517 --> 38:14.784
Miss Mills?

38:14.873 --> 38:16.162
I'm here.

38:16.199 --> 38:18.003
How are you feeling?

38:18.855 --> 38:21.390
Better.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.626
No more scorpions...

38:24.661 --> 38:26.328
ever.

38:28.967 --> 38:32.969
Seven years of tribulation, huh?

38:33.003 --> 38:35.538
According to scripture.

38:35.573 --> 38:37.807
How long have we
been doing this so far?

38:37.842 --> 38:39.309
Mm...

38:39.343 --> 38:45.348
I'm certain it will become easier
once we get accustomed to...

38:46.517 --> 38:49.370
No, sorry, I'm too tired to lie.

39:01.298 --> 39:02.698
Stay as long as you want.

39:02.733 --> 39:05.792
I have some unfinished business
to take care of.

39:07.871 --> 39:11.240
- How'd you two get in here?
- The old munitions tunnels.

39:11.274 --> 39:13.542
I broke a wall.

39:15.946 --> 39:17.546
Why are you in here?

39:17.581 --> 39:21.784
We thought it would be a good
spot for us to do our work.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.686
On the premises, but out the way.

39:23.720 --> 39:26.455
Good point.

39:26.490 --> 39:27.823
I agree.

39:28.225 --> 39:30.793
Just don't break any more walls.

39:30.827 --> 39:33.562
You want access to this place,
I'll get you a key.

39:33.597 --> 39:35.231
Thank you, sir.

39:36.833 --> 39:41.137
Captain, would you like to discuss
what the lieutenant and I discovered?

39:41.171 --> 39:42.538
- Is it over?
- Yes.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.374
That's all I need to hear.

39:46.476 --> 39:50.179
It's late. Go home.

39:50.213 --> 39:51.947
Get some sleep.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.091
Listen...

40:05.529 --> 40:08.067
I'm not really good
at this kind of thing, but I...

40:08.105 --> 40:10.293
You're welcome.

40:10.767 --> 40:14.202
You gotta let me get
the words out, okay?

40:15.311 --> 40:19.972
The things one most tries to hide
are often the things most easily seen.

40:20.411 --> 40:22.878
Which is why I'll add,

40:22.913 --> 40:26.449
"Yes, you do need
to see your sister."

40:26.483 --> 40:29.018
I am... way ahead of you.

40:29.052 --> 40:32.588
Like I was saying,
unfinished business.

40:36.327 --> 40:38.661
- Godspeed.
- Mm!

40:54.378 --> 40:57.866
Abbie Mills to see Jennifer Mills.

40:58.615 --> 41:01.217
Her visitors log says
she refused to see you.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.619
I'm telling you, if she
doesn't want to talk to you,

41:03.654 --> 41:04.854
she can be pretty stubborn.

41:04.888 --> 41:08.057
She doesn't have to talk.
She just has to listen.

41:09.293 --> 41:12.095
Jenny?
You have a visitor.

41:15.366 --> 41:17.199
What the hell?

41:23.307 --> 41:27.009
She was here at lights out.
Where could she have gone?

41:31.415 --> 41:32.915
These doors are electronically locked.

41:32.950 --> 41:34.517
We have people watching the ward.

41:34.551 --> 41:36.119
There's no way out.

41:36.153 --> 41:37.954
She found one.

41:37.988 --> 41:40.856
Get the administrator
and lock the building down.

42:03.013 --> 42:04.299
She's good.
