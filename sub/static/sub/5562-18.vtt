(garage door whirring open)

00:21.222 --> 00:23.288
(garage door whirring)

00:40.808 --> 00:42.474
Sit back.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.209
(releases seat belt)

00:44.211 --> 00:46.378
Watch your eyes.
Gonna be bright.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.115
We're here.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.785
Final destination before
your final destination.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.395
(sighs, groans)

01:09.503 --> 01:10.803
In 12 hours,

01:10.805 --> 01:14.473
You will no longer
be america's problem.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.641
(with hispanic accent):
Can you do something

01:15.643 --> 01:17.409
About these before then?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.312
Please?

01:22.383 --> 01:23.816
Feet stay on.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.684
Ah.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.587
But what if I have to use
the bathroom? (anxious laugh)

01:28.589 --> 01:30.289
You do the jailbird shuffle.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.192
You know that one, right?
(chuckles)

01:39.400 --> 01:42.701
Want something to eat?
Something to drink?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.603
<i> Agua, por favor. </i>
(quiet laugh)

01:57.251 --> 01:59.718
(groans)

02:01.422 --> 02:03.355
(groans)

02:17.771 --> 02:19.838
¶ ¶

02:38.392 --> 02:41.360
(whistling)
(water running)

02:47.368 --> 02:49.434
(whistling continues,
water running)

02:58.879 --> 03:00.746
(toilet flushing)
deeks:
Oh, god!

03:00.748 --> 03:02.514
Aah! Fraggle rock!

03:02.516 --> 03:03.849
Kensi.
Hi.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.450
Hi.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.885
Yeah.
How did you...?
Wait a minute.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.453
Did you just...?
Yes. Yes, I did.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.422
What are you doing here?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.257
What am<i> I</i> doing here?

03:12.259 --> 03:13.825
What am<i> you</i> doing here?

03:13.827 --> 03:15.327
Oh. (laughs)
(laughs)

03:15.329 --> 03:17.396
Oh, kensi.
Yeah.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.498
Kensilina.
Kenselicious, my love.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.233
Yes, dear.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.235
Hmm. Why are you
taking a showering here?

03:23.237 --> 03:25.020
I went surfing.

03:25.021 --> 03:26.804
I thought I would just save
time if I came, you know,

03:26.807 --> 03:28.640
Straight to the boatshed instead
of going back home first.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.443
So, I'm just trying
to save time, clock management.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.212
Well, that makes sense.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.314
Except your board isn't here
with you.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.848
No. No, no, no,
no, no, kensi.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.417
Aah! It's scalding!

03:38.419 --> 03:39.952
All right, listen,
you obviously want to have

03:39.953 --> 03:41.486
An adult conversation
about this, and I-I will.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.388
You want to be honest about
this, I'll be honest about this.
Yes.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.224
Okay, here's
the honesty.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.859
I love you, and you know I love
you, and I love living with you.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.428
It's just... (laughs)

03:49.430 --> 03:50.696
It's just that you...

03:50.698 --> 03:52.331
You... What?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.766
There are 11...

03:54.768 --> 03:57.502
Different shampoo bottles
in the shower

03:57.504 --> 03:59.371
At home-- 11!

03:59.373 --> 04:01.406
What?!

04:01.408 --> 04:03.308
(laughs)

04:03.310 --> 04:04.409
The bathroom
is not that bad.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.509
There's 14 different types
of conditioner bottles.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.945
There's two detanglers.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.513
I don't even know what the
bottom of the shower looks like.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.015
Every time I step in there...
Can you stop?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.783
...I feel like godzilla!
This has never
bothered you before.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.518
Why does it bother you now?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.820
What are you talking about?

04:14.821 --> 04:16.121
I bring it up,
like, twice a week.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.422
I even got callen to give you
a book about being tidy.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.590
Of course it bothers me!

04:18.592 --> 04:20.392
Yeah, but that's
like our repartee.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.560
You know, I make fun
of my ex-boyfriends,

04:21.562 --> 04:23.428
You riff on my mess.
It's what we do.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.031
Except for the fact that my riff
is like a-a cry for help.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.566
It's like a... Like a... "help!"

04:27.568 --> 04:29.601
Oh, your cry for help?

04:29.603 --> 04:32.271
Yeah, and I'm sorry if the
truth hurts, but, baby,

04:32.273 --> 04:34.339
You wanted to have an honest
conversation about this.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.508
I'm gonna show you what hurts.
No, kensi, don't do that.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.577
You're gonna... Aah!
(toilet flushing)

04:38.579 --> 04:40.345
Just stop.
No, don't... I need...

04:40.347 --> 04:41.780
Kensi, that's my towel.
Oh. Oh, what...?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.515
I need that to dry off.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.817
You're obviously doing this
on accident, but that's how I...

04:45.819 --> 04:46.985
Kensi?!

04:46.987 --> 04:49.388
That's fine. I'll just air dry.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.823
I'm just gonna air dry!

04:58.032 --> 04:59.564
No deeks?

04:59.566 --> 05:02.367
Car trouble.
Screw loose.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.403
Callen: We should
start without him.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.305
(clears throat) this is
from earlier this morning.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.740
Security footage from
a safe house in north hollywood

05:08.742 --> 05:10.575
Used by the
u.S. Marshal service.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.844
Nell: The man who took
10 cc's to the neck

05:12.846 --> 05:16.014
Is deputy u.S. Marshal
anthony howard.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.983
Where's his partner?

05:17.985 --> 05:20.018
These guys always work in pairs.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.654
Mm. The flu hit the marshals'
office rather hard.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.924
The man administering
the drug to the marshal

05:25.926 --> 05:27.759
Is one ricardo pena.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.695
Granger: Pena is
a convicted cuban spy.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.697
He spent the last
three years at lompoc.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.899
Why was the marshal taking
him to the safe house?

05:33.901 --> 05:36.568
He's the yang
in a prisoner exchange.

05:36.570 --> 05:40.105
The yin is brett seymour,
former u.S. Naval officer.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.491
He was imprisoned
five years ago

05:42.492 --> 05:44.876
For bringing cable and
telecom equipment into havana.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.746
Granger: Pena knew the exchange
was set to go down tonight.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.881
Which means he didn't
want to go home,

05:49.883 --> 05:52.351
Or he has unfinished
business here in the states.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.087
Well, either way, we need to
find him and put him on a plane

05:55.089 --> 05:57.422
Before cuba realizes
he's missing.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.623
Or seymour doesn't come home.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.359
I'm using kaleidoscope

06:00.361 --> 06:03.362
To figure out pena's next
location after the safe house.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.863
And I requested
for heidi reardon,

06:04.865 --> 06:06.431
The department of
justice attorney

06:06.433 --> 06:08.867
Who tried the pena case,
to meet you at the boatshed.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.502
Great. Kens,
why don't you grab deeks?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.054
Go talk to the attorney,

06:12.055 --> 06:13.605
See if she has any idea
where pena's headed next.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.675
Without letting
on why. Got you.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.609
Safe house?

06:17.611 --> 06:19.745
I thought you'd never ask.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.419
Man:
We'll meet you inside.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.896
Sam:
It's sad.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.964
What's that?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.434
I mean, a safe house,
by definition,

06:42.436 --> 06:44.669
Is a temporary hideout
no one calls home,

06:44.671 --> 06:46.838
But at least
they've got chairs.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.625
What's that supposed to mean?

06:49.626 --> 06:51.476
It means this place is more
comfortable than your house.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.011
How many times do you
want me to apologize?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.546
Never.
Because I'm never coming

06:54.547 --> 06:56.080
To your house to watch
basketball again.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.450
I offered you the bean bag.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.818
Listen, my back is still
killing me-- bean bag!

07:00.821 --> 07:02.988
Deputy marshal howard.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.489
(sighs)

07:04.491 --> 07:05.924
Agent callen.
This is agent hanna.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.125
How you feeling?

07:07.127 --> 07:08.827
I'm still pretty
light-headed.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.930
I don't know how
they got the syringe in here.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.499
No one broke in, no windows
or doors were left open.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.134
Have you used this
safe house before?

07:16.136 --> 07:19.204
Lots of times, but we do
everything by the book.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.540
No one knows what happens here
unless they have a badge.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.542
So that would mean
someone with a badge

07:23.544 --> 07:24.676
Put the syringe under the table.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.978
And told pena where to find it.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.649
Security cameras always on?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.484
I wish.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.985
We only power 'em up
when the house is in use.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.555
Did you bring
these groceries in?

07:36.557 --> 07:39.691
House was stocked
when we got here. Always is.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.827
We have a company
who does that for us.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.495
Sam:
Same company that

07:43.497 --> 07:44.663
Cleans the place
when you're done?

07:44.665 --> 07:45.964
Yeah, we're checking.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.499
We're gonna need some names.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.767
You got it.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.203
Decaf almond milk.
Thank you,
detective deeks.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.571
Oh. Hey. Ah.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.972
So sorry I'm late.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.973
Yeah, you must be agent blye.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.875
Heidi reardon, doj.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.776
Nice to meet you, and thank you
so much for coming.
My pleasure.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.245
Coffee?

08:00.247 --> 08:03.014
I see you've met
my ocd partner.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.716
Hope you washed your
hands before coming.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.519
Uh, detective deeks told me

08:07.521 --> 08:08.920
You want to discuss
the pena case.

08:08.922 --> 08:09.921
Yes.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.523
That was three years ago.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.757
So I have to ask: Why now?

08:12.759 --> 08:14.442
Uh, well, as you know,

08:14.443 --> 08:16.126
The government is sending
mr. Pena back to cuba

08:16.129 --> 08:18.230
As part of a prisoner exchange,

08:18.232 --> 08:20.732
And so, essentially,
this is just a formality.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.200
We have to go over the case
before we close our file.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.035
How can I help?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.137
If you don't mind,
we'd like to start at the end.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.540
Why did pena get sent
to lompoc in the first place?

08:28.542 --> 08:31.610
Failure to register as a
foreign agent on american soil.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.779
And nothing else?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.947
My boss was pushing for me
to make a case for conspiracy.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.082
Pena had infiltrated
agency five,

08:37.084 --> 08:38.917
An anti-castro group
in santa monica,

08:38.919 --> 08:42.087
And we had reason to believe
that he was going to sabotage it

08:42.089 --> 08:43.722
And commit violence
against its members.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.925
We had evidence, but not enough
of it was admissible.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.011
So no charges stuck.

08:49.012 --> 08:51.096
Look, I know that failure to
register doesn't seem like much,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.965
But it was enough to protect
our nation from a communist spy

08:53.967 --> 08:56.668
For three years and counting.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.071
I'm just glad
he's finally going home.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.573
Yeah, of course.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.174
Yeah, it's a
good thing.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.676
So what do you
really think

09:04.678 --> 09:05.844
Happened with deeks
this morning?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.679
Kensi told us--
car problems.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.813
I don't know.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.882
I smell trouble
in paradise.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.718
Why do you seem
so happy about it?

09:13.720 --> 09:14.920
Ah, this is a
teaching moment.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.154
You know, every
relationship,

09:16.156 --> 09:18.890
Slash friendship goes
through a rough patch.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.659
Even... Densi.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.328
Interesting. I always
thought it was keeks.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.963
Wait a second.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.332
Are we in a rough patch
I don't know about?

09:27.334 --> 09:30.001
Neric? No, no, no,
we're-we're... We're fine.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.871
Are we about to<i> hit</i> a rough
patch I don't know about?
No.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.906
I'm just a big believer
in prophylactics.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.241
Oh.
In...

09:36.243 --> 09:37.642
Preventative measures.

09:37.644 --> 09:38.677
Like a vaccine.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.678
Right.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.814
So a vaccine for me.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.016
Wow, eric, way to sweep a girl
off her feet.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.651
This is coming
out all wrong.

09:46.653 --> 09:47.886
Yeah, I noticed.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.789
Um, look,
statistically speaking,

09:50.791 --> 09:53.358
We will hit
a rough patch.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.760
And when we do,

09:55.762 --> 09:57.862
I don't want us to get a bug.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.130
A bug?

09:59.132 --> 10:00.765
A software bug.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.735
A flaw that causes unexpected

10:03.737 --> 10:05.337
And unintended results.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.740
You know, most people think

10:08.742 --> 10:12.877
U.S. Navy rear admiral grace
hopper coined the term "bug"

10:12.879 --> 10:15.080
When her team discovered
a moth trapped

10:15.082 --> 10:17.215
In a mark ii
calculator.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.717
But...?

10:18.719 --> 10:20.952
But thomas edison
was using "bug"

10:20.954 --> 10:25.190
To describe technical
difficulties way back in 1878.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.727
Eric, we're not having
car problems.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.962
And when and if we do,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.665
I'm sure with
your engineering background

10:33.667 --> 10:36.668
And my... Brain...

10:36.670 --> 10:38.737
We'll be just fine.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.040
By car problems, you mean...

10:42.042 --> 10:43.908
Don't overthink it.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.377
(tablet chimes)

10:45.379 --> 10:47.278
Whoa. Check it out.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.980
You got to call
callen and sam.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.215
(phone line ringing)
already dialing.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.417
Hey, callen, can you put me
on speaker phone?

10:52.419 --> 10:53.952
Go ahead, nell.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.821
So, the company

10:55.822 --> 10:57.689
That stocked the safe house
kitchen was a dead end.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.875
But?

10:59.876 --> 11:02.060
But I looked into the company
that cleans the safe house.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.262
Turns out they hired a
new employee last week--

11:04.264 --> 11:05.997
Oksana azarov.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.333
Brace for impact-- I'm
sending you a photo I.D.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.301
(beeps)

11:13.373 --> 11:16.274
Anna kolcheck.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.809
Don't look at me.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.144
I didn't know
she was in town.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.080
Oh, she's in town.
Clearly.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.082
Nell:
And hat's not all. I looked into

11:24.084 --> 11:26.418
Ricardo pena's visitor log
from the prison.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.254
"oksana azarov" visited
him there last week.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.090
That's how pena knew
where to find the syringe.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.159
Anna put it there.
Mm.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.110
You know where hetty is?

11:52.112 --> 11:53.344
No. Why?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.413
Well, no one's seen her.
She's mia.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.381
Is there a problem?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.216
Anna kolcheck.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.768
She helped ricardo pena

11:59.769 --> 12:01.319
Escape from the marshal's
safe house this morning.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.854
She was part of
the cleaning crew.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.189
She used a fake I.D.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.357
She also visited pena
in lompoc last week,

12:06.359 --> 12:08.226
Probably to tell him
where the syringe was.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.862
Well, marshals do a full
background check on everyone

12:10.864 --> 12:12.731
Having anything to do
with those safe houses.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.432
Which means she was
professionally backstopped.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.867
She's working for someone.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.869
And here I was,
having such a pleasant morning.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.370
All right...

12:19.372 --> 12:21.506
Don't get hung up
on anna just yet.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.874
They may still be together,

12:22.876 --> 12:25.009
But I want you to focus
on finding pena.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.379
Preferably before the cubans
realize he's missing.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.182
Well, anna and pena aren't
the only ones missing.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.951
I'll deal with hetty.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.453
You find pena.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.894
Kensi: Hey.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.196
So...

12:45.198 --> 12:46.765
Eric found
security footage

12:46.767 --> 12:48.433
Of anna picking up
pena in a honda civic

12:48.435 --> 12:49.467
A few blocks from
the safe house.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.869
So you're still tracking 'em?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.537
No, we lost 'em on the freeway.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.806
All right, follow up
with that lead from the doj.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.274
Talk to that
anti-castro group

12:56.276 --> 12:58.777
That pena infiltrated
a few years ago.
Agency five.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.478
You know, I was thinking--
what if pena's not a spy,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.280
What if he joined them
to switch sides?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.948
Kensi: Could explain why
he didn't want to go through

13:03.950 --> 13:05.617
With the prisoner exchange.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.285
Or agency five could be
unfinished business for him.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.420
Regardless,
how does anna fit into this?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.421
I don't know.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.823
But sam and I
are about to pay

13:11.825 --> 13:12.857
Someone
a visit who might.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.325
All right.
Got it.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.497
Aah!

13:19.499 --> 13:22.333
Too good! Too good.

13:22.335 --> 13:26.137
One more time. Maybe make it
a little more interesting.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.839
Put some skin in it.

13:27.841 --> 13:31.075
Unbelievable. He even hustles
guys on the tennis court.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.411
Supposed to be a
gentlemen's game, arkady.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.083
(laughs)

13:42.455 --> 13:45.523
I've got this smug trust fund
bastard by the balls.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.525
Even with my busted arm.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.594
He thinks I am weak.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.597
Idiot. If you two
mess this up for me,

13:52.599 --> 13:53.865
I'll kill you.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.334
Ah, I won't kill you.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.436
Tell him you have
to ice your knee.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.537
We need to talk to you.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.506
I have to ice my knee.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.574
Uh-huh.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.381
See you in a bit.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.084
I'm going to squeeze
$4,000 out of this guy

14:13.086 --> 14:14.552
Before the day is done.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.887
You need the money
that bad?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.188
(laughs): No.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.925
But he needs to be taught
to respect his elders.

14:20.927 --> 14:24.395
So what can I do for you?

14:24.397 --> 14:25.864
Where is anna?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.298
(laughs)

14:27.300 --> 14:30.001
Anna...

14:30.003 --> 14:31.636
How am I supposed
to know what she does?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.538
You think she writes in diary,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.907
Brings it to my house
so I can check grammar?

14:35.909 --> 14:38.109
You didn't know
that she's in los angeles?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.245
No!

14:40.247 --> 14:41.579
I swear I haven't seen her

14:41.581 --> 14:43.615
Since we got out of russia
together.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.584
Oh, and I am still
so cold from that prison.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.019
It was just... (shivers)

14:48.021 --> 14:49.654
You haven't seen anna at all?

14:54.628 --> 14:57.929
Come to think of it, there was
that one time in london.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.064
Uh...

15:00.066 --> 15:01.366
Oh, and vancouver.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.269
Vancouver is beautiful city.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.070
Very underappreciated.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.572
You've seen her that many times
in the a month?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.074
We are bonding.
Making up for lost time.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.509
Bonding, but she
didn't mention she's

15:11.511 --> 15:12.644
Visiting the city you live in?

15:12.646 --> 15:14.312
No.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.916
Is she in trouble?
You can tell me.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.184
That's what we're trying
to figure that out.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.186
If you see anna...

15:22.188 --> 15:25.189
You will be first to know.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.925
Look, I'm not kidding.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.559
I love you guys.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.396
You are my heroes.
My shining

15:31.398 --> 15:33.231
White knight in shining armor.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.099
Deeks:
So, the anticommunist leader

15:35.101 --> 15:37.035
Of agency five is
a dentist. Wow.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.003
I bet there's an
interesting story there.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.940
Yeah, I don't really,
um, care, because I...

15:41.942 --> 15:45.209
Aah! ...Don't like
dentists at all.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.145
That's 'cause you're
an anti-dentite.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.247
I, in contrast,
love my dentist.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.015
I go as much as my
insurance will allow.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.450
Nobody likes the dentist.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.952
Didn't even mind going as a kid.

15:53.954 --> 15:54.953
That's because of the gas.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.521
No, not the gas.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.424
But dr. Brantley have
the hottest hygienist in town.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.224
(inhales)

16:00.226 --> 16:01.259
Debbie.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.094
Sweet, sweet debbie.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.095
And there it is.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.697
Hello.
Dr. Ben walker.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.231
Thank you for meeting with us.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.466
I am special agent kensi blye.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.068
This is my partner marty deeks.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.536
Wow.

16:11.537 --> 16:13.003
I'm so thrilled
to have you both here.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.973
Uh, the work that we're doing
here is so important

16:14.975 --> 16:17.709
To the future,
and it means so much to me

16:17.711 --> 16:19.310
That you've come
all this way to...

16:19.312 --> 16:22.380
To clarify, we're not
here for a cleaning.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.581
Oh, of course not.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.283
No, the gum and plaque stuff--

16:25.285 --> 16:27.452
That's just to pay the bills.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.221
You're interested
in agency five.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.056
Yeah, not so much
the organization

16:32.058 --> 16:33.491
As much as a former member.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.693
Ricardo pena?
Do you remember him?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.695
Name doesn't ring a bell.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.430
He's cuban.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.164
Joined the organization
about three years ago,

16:41.167 --> 16:42.367
Before he
went off to prison.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.535
Oh, yeah.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.071
Yeah, he showed up
to a few meetings.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.773
Came late, left early.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.742
Sat in the back,
but never talked.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.543
I'm sorry, he never
caused any trouble

16:52.545 --> 16:54.078
For you or the other members?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.546
(chuckling):
No, no.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.081
No, he was completely harmless.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.716
Well, that's not
what you told the doj.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.585
Doj?

17:00.587 --> 17:04.155
I-I've never spoken to anybody
from the doj in my life.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.424
Most certainly
not about this guy.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.427
No, honestly, I-I thought
he just came to the meetings

17:09.429 --> 17:12.397
For free coffee
and doughnuts.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.300
(keyboarding)

17:20.140 --> 17:21.472
What?

17:21.474 --> 17:24.509
Good talk.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.144
Before.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.646
Oh. Okay.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.615
Cool.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.183
(both keyboarding)

17:32.185 --> 17:34.052
Wait, "good talk," like...

17:34.054 --> 17:35.753
You want to talk
about this stuff more often?

17:35.755 --> 17:39.490
Or "good talk,"
like, "we're good"?

17:39.492 --> 17:42.093
We're good.

17:42.095 --> 17:45.363
I have a limit of
one talk per year.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.198
Right.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.534
But what if
something else comes up?

17:49.536 --> 17:52.503
I mean, we weren't even talking
about anything specific before,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.338
Just the probability
of something coming up.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.140
Okay, if something else
comes up,

17:56.142 --> 17:57.542
We can talk about it...

17:57.544 --> 17:59.143
Next year.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.279
Oh.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.248
I am so confused.
(computer beeps)

18:07.187 --> 18:11.122
Kaleidoscope got a hit on anna's
car from the safe house.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.323
It's parked in a cul-de-sac

18:12.325 --> 18:15.259
In playa del rey.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.861
Callen, I got an address.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.100
End of the street,
silver honda civic.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.273
We got blood.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.608
Lots of it.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.212
Question is, whose blood is it--

18:34.214 --> 18:36.581
Pena's...

18:36.583 --> 18:37.648
Or anna's?

18:50.497 --> 18:53.698
Henrietta, it's owen.
Again.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.667
If you're lying in a ditch and
really can't get to the phone,

18:56.669 --> 18:59.570
You have my apologies.
Otherwise call me the hell back.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.873
Henrietta lange.

19:01.875 --> 19:02.907
Who is our boss?

19:02.909 --> 19:05.743
Ooh, who is
our fearless leader?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.311
Who is missing.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.547
When was the last time
either one of you saw her?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.315
Uh, come to think of it,
not since

19:11.317 --> 19:13.718
Before the weekend.
Yeah, me either.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.186
Change that.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.388
Right.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.590
But between you and me,

19:19.591 --> 19:21.791
You know that'll be
difficult-slash-impossible

19:21.794 --> 19:24.195
To find her
if she doesn't want to be found.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.864
(clears throat) but you already
knew that-slash-don't care.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.599
I'm gonna get to work.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.304
Nell, where's anna kolcheck been
since we left russia?

19:33.306 --> 19:36.307
Callen and sam said arkady
mentioned something about london

19:36.309 --> 19:38.943
And vancouver, but I haven't
been able to confirm that yet.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.745
You holding out on me?

19:40.747 --> 19:42.480
No.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.348
Me?

19:44.350 --> 19:47.852
No. I just started working
on this about an hour ago.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.254
To be honest, anna's gonna
be difficult to find.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.522
She's a skilled
agent...

19:51.524 --> 19:53.824
Who knows how
to lay low.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.793
Exactly.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.863
You know, it's scary-- you two
are starting to sound more

19:58.865 --> 20:00.932
And more alike
every day.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.667
Nell:
Assistant director,
I assure you...

20:02.669 --> 20:05.336
I'm sorry, are you
questioning nell's integrity?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.972
Because she is a beacon.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.840
A shining beacon

20:09.842 --> 20:13.544
Of honesty and virtue and...

20:13.546 --> 20:15.780
And rectitude.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.982
Okay, eric, thank you

20:17.984 --> 20:20.651
For that.
Thank you, thank you.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.955
Um, assistant director,
we will contact you

20:23.957 --> 20:25.256
If we find out anything,

20:25.258 --> 20:27.325
Okay?

20:30.296 --> 20:32.363
Rectitude.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.537
(door closes)
can you believe that?

20:39.539 --> 20:40.838
Him questioning
you like that?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.740
Eric, thank you, but
I really don't need you

20:42.742 --> 20:43.941
To stand up for me.

20:43.943 --> 20:44.942
Yeah, but, I mean...

20:44.944 --> 20:48.879
No, I can take care of myself.

20:48.881 --> 20:52.850
I know you can, I was
just being gallant.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.853
You were,
but I think we should

20:55.855 --> 20:57.989
Just get back to work.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.857
Okay?

21:00.326 --> 21:01.325
Yeah.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.393
Sure.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.966
Hey.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.002
So something's
not adding up.

21:11.004 --> 21:13.638
Ben walker from agency five
never actually spoke to the doj.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.707
Deeks:
Even more curious,

21:15.708 --> 21:17.775
He only had six months left
on his sentence before the u.S.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.410
Was gonna deport him
back to cuba anyway.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.846
We have over 150 cuban spies

21:21.848 --> 21:23.581
In federal custody right now.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.983
And by my count, 25 of those
are a much bigger,

21:25.985 --> 21:27.818
More celebrated deal
back home.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.587
And yet the cuban government
chose pena

21:29.589 --> 21:31.289
Over all of them
for the exchange.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.990
Exactly. So we took a closer
look at the doj file,

21:32.992 --> 21:35.026
And not only does it say
that he entered the u.S.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.994
On two separate dates,
but it also lists

21:36.996 --> 21:38.496
Two separate birthdays.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.598
Deeks: Therefore we're
gonna go back and talk

21:40.600 --> 21:41.666
To the doj attorney.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.900
Wish us luck.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.969
See you later.
Sam: Good luck.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.910
Have a seat.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.479
Different room.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.815
I feel like I'm getting
the royal treatment.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.350
Yeah, you wish.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.918
We talked to ben walker
at agency five

22:00.920 --> 22:04.055
And read your file on pena.

22:04.057 --> 22:05.589
And?

22:05.591 --> 22:08.859
And why is there a falsified
deposition from walker

22:08.861 --> 22:11.362
Alleging that ricardo pena
was threatening him

22:11.364 --> 22:13.497
And other members
of his organization?

22:14.934 --> 22:16.934
Deeks:
Nothing?

22:16.936 --> 22:18.936
How 'bout this?
Why does pena's file have him

22:18.938 --> 22:22.073
Entering the u.S.
On two separate occasions?

22:25.511 --> 22:27.511
Still nothing.

22:27.513 --> 22:30.514
Here's a softball.
(clears throat)

22:30.516 --> 22:33.884
Why does pena have two separate
birth dates on his file?

22:33.886 --> 22:36.420
Yeah, that's super weird.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.827
Deeks, you're a lawyer.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.729
Mm-hmm.
Right?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.130
Any one of these infractions

22:46.131 --> 22:47.530
Could get heidi
disbarred, correct?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.233
That's not gonna
matter, kensi,

22:49.234 --> 22:50.934
'cause she's not gonna be
practicing any law

22:50.937 --> 22:53.904
In the state of california
with a felony conviction.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.439
Oh, that's gonna suck.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.009
I was two years out
of law school.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.562
Brand-new to the department.

23:01.563 --> 23:04.114
Scared I was gonna lose my job
in a really bad economy.

23:04.117 --> 23:07.985
Which is probably why
they chose me for the case.

23:07.987 --> 23:08.986
Who chose you?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.488
Honestly, I...

23:10.490 --> 23:12.623
I don't know
who was calling the shots.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.925
Not your boss?
No. I...

23:14.927 --> 23:18.062
I never knew where it was coming
from or how high up it went.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.999
But we were given a mandate
to put ricardo pena behind bars,

23:22.001 --> 23:24.068
As quickly as possible
and as long as possible.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.736
Even if it meant tampering
with evidence.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.037
Deeks: The judge know?
Public defender?

23:27.039 --> 23:29.106
Everyone was in on it.
Everyone.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.509
Kensi: Why?
I wish I could tell you.

23:31.511 --> 23:36.013
We were told to find a reason
to put ricardo pena behind bars.

23:36.015 --> 23:39.483
And to make it look real.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.152
Wow.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.521
Deeks:
<i> I don't know</i>

23:43.523 --> 23:45.089
If we took the red pill
or the blue pill,

23:45.091 --> 23:46.157
But we're definitely
going down the rabbit hole

23:46.159 --> 23:47.992
On this case.
Hey.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.661
It doesn't make sense.
Why would the person
who wanted pena

23:50.663 --> 23:52.196
Put away three years ago
be the same person

23:52.198 --> 23:53.864
That helped bust him out
this morning?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.699
Unless the goal
was to keep pena

23:55.701 --> 23:57.768
On american soil but in a cage.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.171
Well, that would explain why
they didn't kill him in prison.

24:00.173 --> 24:03.107
Person pulling the strings here
obviously had access to him.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.910
Deeks: Yeah, but they didn't
touch him in lompoc. I mean...

24:05.912 --> 24:07.711
Maybe they busted him out
just to see where he went,

24:07.713 --> 24:10.881
Which would explain why pena
went along with the plan.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.616
And why this is all
happening right before pena

24:12.618 --> 24:14.151
Was supposed
to be sent home.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.619
Thanks, guys.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.621
Hmm.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.024
So where does anna
fit into all of this?

24:20.026 --> 24:22.693
And who put her up to it?

24:22.695 --> 24:25.196
Callen, I've been tracking
arkady like you asked.

24:25.198 --> 24:28.065
He just drove to a mini mall
in sherman oaks

24:28.067 --> 24:29.467
And gave the keys to anna.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.705
(scoffs) one day,
I'm gonna kill him.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.975
One of these days,
I may help you.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.211
(engine revving)

24:40.213 --> 24:41.879
Okay, guys,
turn at the next intersection.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.715
The mercedes should be
about 100 yards ahead of you.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.050
(tires screech)

24:46.052 --> 24:48.919
(engine revving)

24:53.226 --> 24:54.258
Sam: There it is.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.126
Black mercedes.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.862
Eric, we got eyes
on pena and anna.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.564
Great. They seem to be keeping
pace with the traffic.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.199
Eric: Uh, kensi,
you are half a mile out

25:02.201 --> 25:04.635
And closing in on the mercedes.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.137
(tires screech)

25:06.138 --> 25:07.638
Kensi: Just got here.
Deeks: Barely.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.840
We just barely got here.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.041
Eric: Callen, sam,
the mercedes seems to be taking

25:12.044 --> 25:14.044
A right at the next light--
stay with it.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.579
Sam: You sure you know
what you're doing, eric?

25:15.581 --> 25:18.849
(scoffing laugh): Sam, I've done
this 1,000 times.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.751
Playstation
doesn't count, eric.
Eric: Yeah, but...

25:20.753 --> 25:22.920
No. It doesn't count.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.725
(engine revs, tires screech)

25:29.695 --> 25:31.228
Guys, we've been made.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.697
(engine revving)

25:35.234 --> 25:37.301
(tires screeching)

25:39.539 --> 25:41.122
Kensi, take your next right.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.706
You can cut the mercedes off
at the intersection.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.208
(tires screech)

25:44.210 --> 25:45.743
(engine revving)

25:45.745 --> 25:46.810
(tires screech)

25:47.179 --> 25:48.946
(tires screeching)

26:02.261 --> 26:03.694
Agent callen.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.963
Did you miss me?

26:31.123 --> 26:34.091
So... You interrogate
arkady out there

26:34.093 --> 26:35.960
With the kayaks
and the canoes,

26:35.962 --> 26:38.162
But you stick me
in this closet?

26:38.164 --> 26:41.899
Is that who you're
working for, your father?

26:41.901 --> 26:44.702
Can I please get
some coffee first?

26:44.704 --> 26:46.170
You wouldn't believe
the day I had.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.171
Sam: G...

26:47.173 --> 26:48.839
I owe you 20 bucks.

26:48.841 --> 26:51.909
She's a bigger pain
in the ass than her dad.
Mm-hmm.

26:51.911 --> 26:52.876
(scoffs)

26:52.878 --> 26:53.944
Pena do that?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.613
It's just a little scratch.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.148
Well, required
13 stitches.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.750
I'll be fine.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.802
Where is he now?

27:01.803 --> 27:03.853
Well, pena didn't leave me
a detailed itinerary.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.925
Last time I saw him
was when I dropped him off

27:07.927 --> 27:10.060
At the corner
of coldwater and ventura.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.996
When a man pointing a gun
to your head

27:11.998 --> 27:14.331
Tells you to pull over,
you pull over.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.000
The man that
you helped

27:16.002 --> 27:18.135
Break out of the safe house
this morning...

27:18.137 --> 27:19.803
Turned on you?

27:20.773 --> 27:22.873
Raised by wolves, that one.

27:24.143 --> 27:28.012
He was less grateful
than I thought he'd be.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.247
Then why did you help him
escape in the first place?

27:30.249 --> 27:33.050
Better question is...

27:33.052 --> 27:37.721
Where will he be today at 4:00?

27:37.723 --> 27:40.090
I'm supposed to meet him
at a bar.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.826
And it won't look good
if I don't show up.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.995
What's this meeting about?

27:44.997 --> 27:48.132
I've convinced pena
I'm a russian attaché.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.717
Why?

27:49.718 --> 27:51.301
Someone paid me
a lot of money to do it.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.839
Pena needs new I.D. Papers.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.307
I'm supposed to bring my boss,

27:57.309 --> 28:00.377
Who has the connections
to make the arrangements.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.112
New I.D. Papers?

28:02.114 --> 28:04.381
So pena doesn't want
to go back to cuba?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.050
I have no idea.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.252
He's not much for conversation.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.220
Who dragged you into this?
Arkady?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.221
(chuckles)

28:11.223 --> 28:13.223
No.
No one drags me anywhere.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.193
Someone offered me
a paying gig, and I accepted.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.196
Arkady has nothing
to do with this.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.700
Uh-huh. So, that wasn't his car
we found you in?

28:24.003 --> 28:25.969
He didn't even know
I was in los angeles

28:25.971 --> 28:28.272
Until you two spooked him
this morning.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.274
When he called,
it was good timing.

28:30.276 --> 28:33.243
I... Happened to need
a new set of wheels.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.779
Let's get back to the meeting
you set up.

28:35.781 --> 28:39.149
If it's not arkady,
who's supposed to be your boss?

28:39.151 --> 28:40.918
Well...

28:40.920 --> 28:44.788
I don't mean to be
so forward, callen,

28:44.790 --> 28:46.490
Especially after
I didn't return your call,

28:46.492 --> 28:49.860
But... I thought
you might come with me.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.995
How do I know it's not a setup?

28:51.997 --> 28:54.031
Are we back to the trust thing?

28:54.033 --> 28:55.866
(scoffs)

28:55.868 --> 28:57.868
Seriously?
Well, to be fair,

28:57.870 --> 29:00.070
You did help a
convicted felon escape

29:00.072 --> 29:03.207
A marshal's custody,
so, yeah,

29:03.209 --> 29:05.342
Seriously.

29:05.344 --> 29:09.847
Again, you're concentrating
on the wrong thing.

29:09.849 --> 29:13.317
We both know I'm your best shot
at getting to pena.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.454
So you agree
to come with me...

29:17.456 --> 29:20.290
And I'll tell you
where he will be today at 4:00.

29:39.912 --> 29:42.379
Arkady:
It is free country.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.549
Hey. Look who
I found outside.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.284
I missed my friends.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.919
You missed being the
center of attention.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.888
Sam, make sure
arkady stays here

29:50.890 --> 29:52.456
And anna stays
in that room.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.423
Where<i> you</i> going?

29:53.425 --> 29:55.492
For a walk. With you.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.162
You're leaving me
with the two of them?

29:58.164 --> 30:00.364
I'm standing right here.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.833
Yeah. That's the problem.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.269
Sit down.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.070
You know,
anna has got a point.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.339
She may be our best shot
at getting to pena.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.875
Except we've all heard
anna's speech before.

30:11.877 --> 30:15.412
And russia was the exception,
but anna works alone.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.447
She doesn't want a partner,
she doesn't trust a team,

30:17.449 --> 30:19.082
She doesn't need
anyone's help.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.451
Sounds like you got
that line memorized.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.288
What are you
trying to say, granger?

30:24.290 --> 30:26.290
I'm not trying to say anything.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.425
You're not trying to draw
some sort of a comparison

30:28.427 --> 30:30.227
Between anna and...
And who?

30:32.431 --> 30:34.431
Okay.

30:34.433 --> 30:38.168
Look, it's time to put personal
agendas aside, agent callen.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.269
That won't be a problem.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.305
(wry laugh)

30:41.307 --> 30:42.840
What could go wrong?

30:42.842 --> 30:44.274
Lots.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.609
Bucket loads.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.012
But don't let it.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.287
(indistinct conversations)

30:57.289 --> 31:00.190
(imitates robot voice):
Shall we play a game?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.192
Yeah, see?
That's the one.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.095
That's the robot
I wanted last night.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.630
I thought that you liked
rosie from<i> the jetsons.</i>

31:06.632 --> 31:08.332
No, no, the one
you just did, that's it--

31:08.334 --> 31:09.867
That's the jam right there.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.401
Sam: Tell me I'm not
listening to you two

31:11.403 --> 31:12.603
Talking about role playing.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.739
With a robot.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.874
Actually, sam, I need you
to be supportive to us, because

31:16.876 --> 31:19.243
We just got a major breakthrough

31:19.245 --> 31:20.911
In the bedroom.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.212
Kensi:
And I'm gonna need you

31:22.214 --> 31:23.280
To forgive us, because you

31:23.282 --> 31:24.381
Shouldn't be listening to this.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.482
Sorry about that.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.518
Sam:
Don't be sorry, be discreet.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.021
Okay.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.958
So this is what
it's always like--

31:34.960 --> 31:36.660
To work with a team?
With this one.

31:37.563 --> 31:38.595
Callen (over comm):
We are...

31:38.597 --> 31:41.531
Highly specialized.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.100
I see.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.135
(coughs)

31:47.907 --> 31:50.007
Are we good?

31:52.278 --> 31:53.443
We'll see.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.416
Pena just walked in
the front entrance.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.054
Oksana.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.390
Ricardo.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.392
How's that arm?

32:08.394 --> 32:10.227
Something to remember you by.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.595
This is yevgeny.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.632
Does he speak english?

32:15.634 --> 32:18.068
(russian accent):
Don't insult someone

32:18.070 --> 32:19.703
Right before
you ask for his help.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.707
Told you he was
raised by wolves.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.409
I'm sorry.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.344
No harm intended.

32:27.346 --> 32:31.214
Oksana tells me
you need new papers.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.517
She was supposed to have them

32:33.519 --> 32:35.285
Ready for me this morning.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.422
Technical difficulties.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.590
You really don't want

32:40.592 --> 32:43.060
To go back to cuba, do you?

32:43.062 --> 32:45.262
Can you blame me?

32:45.264 --> 32:46.964
I don't know.

32:46.966 --> 32:50.233
You spent three years
in american prison.

32:50.235 --> 32:53.437
I thought you might have more
<i> tocka</i> for your homeland.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.973
(chuckles)

32:55.975 --> 32:58.075
Trust me.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.477
I've done enough aching for cuba

33:00.479 --> 33:02.179
For one lifetime.

33:03.449 --> 33:06.083
So can you help me or not?

33:10.756 --> 33:12.990
(grunts)
whoa!

33:14.026 --> 33:15.058
Kensi:
Down. Get down, everybody down.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.293
Ricardo, stop.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.327
Get down, get down.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.328
Get down.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.297
Don't you dare move.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.432
You don't want to do this, pena.

33:22.434 --> 33:25.335
(people shrieking, shouting)

33:33.479 --> 33:34.578
Out of the way!

33:41.587 --> 33:43.520
What the hell just happened?

33:43.522 --> 33:45.589
One minute you're talking,
the next thing pena freaks out.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.324
He slipped up.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.458
How did he slip up? We were

33:48.460 --> 33:49.593
Listening to
the entire conversation.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.129
<i> Tocka.</i>
It's a russian word

33:52.131 --> 33:54.264
That has no english
or spanish translation.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.633
I'm pretty sure that pena didn't
pick it up from his cellmates

33:56.635 --> 33:58.435
At lompoc when they were
discussing nabokov.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.270
Unbelievable.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.705
Pena didn't
want to go back to cuba

34:01.707 --> 34:03.140
Because he isn't cuban.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.641
He's russian.
Problem is,

34:04.643 --> 34:06.510
No one's gonna believe us.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.778
Hetty:
Except me, mr. Callen.

34:22.294 --> 34:25.095
I've long believed
that ricardo pena

34:25.097 --> 34:27.230
Is not the man he claims to be.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.666
And I wasn't about to let him
get on a plane to cuba.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.302
Anna was working for you.

34:32.304 --> 34:35.338
Uh, sheds, uh, new light
on the term "microeconomy."

34:35.340 --> 34:38.341
You read the doj's
file on pena,

34:38.343 --> 34:40.377
And you knew
the case was weak.

34:40.379 --> 34:44.281
He's a russian spy,
not a cuban spy.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.849
No one would
believe me.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.351
The united states
and russia

34:48.353 --> 34:50.854
Were courting each
other at the time,

34:50.856 --> 34:53.857
And it wasn't
considered romantic

34:53.859 --> 34:55.358
To make waves.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.461
Aha. And the more noise
you made,

34:57.463 --> 34:59.396
The faster they wanted
to put the case to bed.

34:59.398 --> 35:03.233
Putting mr. Pena in prison was
like putting a band-aid on a...

35:03.235 --> 35:05.202
On an open chest wound.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.370
Now, look, we know
that pena wanted new papers

35:07.372 --> 35:09.239
So that he could
get out of the country.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.774
We still
don't know his endgame.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.308
Or what he was doing here
in the first place.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.745
(sighs)

35:15.747 --> 35:17.814
What?

35:19.518 --> 35:21.585
(footsteps approaching)

35:26.258 --> 35:28.558
Callen, thank god.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.228
Hetty lefted me here
tied up like dog.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.662
Oh, drama queen.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.331
Please.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.365
I need water.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.266
I am parched.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.735
Mm-hmm.
You want water?

35:40.339 --> 35:42.372
Talk.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.774
Arkady: Is that the son of
a bitch that hurt anna?

35:44.776 --> 35:46.576
Who is he?

35:47.880 --> 35:50.447
A bad seed.
Always has been.

35:50.449 --> 35:53.216
You two were
kgb together?

35:53.218 --> 35:54.885
His name is roman nulishkin.

35:54.887 --> 35:56.853
I heard rumors
that he was in the states,

35:56.855 --> 35:58.421
But never believed them.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.590
That's 'cause he's been in
prison the last three years.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.858
Good.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.728
Until anna broke him out
this morning.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.763
(laughs)

36:06.765 --> 36:08.865
Girl has got skills.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.901
Takes after her papa.

36:10.903 --> 36:13.270
What was nulishkin here for?

36:14.473 --> 36:17.707
Guy like that does not
come to l.A. For the beach.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.343
Nulishkin studied
to be engineer.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.379
He came here for a reason:

36:22.381 --> 36:24.314
Your technology.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.382
Where?

36:25.384 --> 36:27.384
Water.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.752
Where?

36:30.355 --> 36:32.589
National aeronautic
research lab.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.560
Hey. Callen, don't go.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.229
Hetty, stay here. Come on,
you look good in leather.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.014
Stop yelling.
You're making things

36:41.015 --> 36:42.798
Much more difficult
than they need to be.
(line ringing)

36:42.801 --> 36:44.401
Get me
everything you can

36:44.403 --> 36:46.369
On roman nulishkin.
Start with police reports.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.504
Yup.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.340
Okay, roman nulishkin.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.441
Hmm.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.475
No arrests.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.344
Wait, let me try

36:54.346 --> 36:55.412
A different spelling.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.415
Bingo. Roman nulishkin.

36:58.417 --> 37:02.419
Arrested in February of 2005
for breaking and entering.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.988
Well, maybe that's why he
changed his name to pena.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.523
Where was he arrested?

37:06.525 --> 37:09.392
Uh... Hancock park.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.495
In the private home
of mark webster.

37:12.497 --> 37:15.232
He was and still is the head of

37:15.234 --> 37:16.933
Industrial engineering at narl.

37:16.935 --> 37:20.437
Granger:
So webster still knows things
russia would find important?

37:20.439 --> 37:21.938
Nulishkin has
already been caught.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.607
He doesn't want to have to
also go home empty-handed.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.642
Eric, send us the address
of that house.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.811
Yup.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.748
Eric: Guys, I can't access
the home security system,

37:31.750 --> 37:33.783
And I can't get anyone
on the phone.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.519
Callen:
We're going in dark.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.254
You two take the back;
we'll go in the front.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.913
(groans softly)

38:03.915 --> 38:05.815
(blow thuds, man yells)

38:07.386 --> 38:10.520
(groaning)

38:10.522 --> 38:13.323
(panting)

38:13.325 --> 38:15.659
(grunting, panting)

38:15.661 --> 38:17.294
(grunts)

38:18.063 --> 38:20.530
(groans)

38:20.532 --> 38:21.798
(gasps)

38:21.800 --> 38:22.899
(gasps)

38:22.901 --> 38:24.534
You're gonna be all right.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.436
No! Hep, hep, hep.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.505
(grunting)

38:28.507 --> 38:29.639
Oh! (whistles)

38:29.641 --> 38:30.907
Ouch.
Deeks:
Wow.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.409
(grunting softly)

38:32.411 --> 38:34.944
(groans)
deeks:
Bet cuba's

38:34.946 --> 38:37.013
Looking pretty good
right about now, huh?

38:37.015 --> 38:39.649
(groaning)

38:39.651 --> 38:42.085
Okay. Anna.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.353
You okay?

38:45.424 --> 38:48.325
We just keep on
bumping into each other today.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.871
Hetty:
I have to do something

39:01.873 --> 39:04.074
I don't very often do.

39:04.076 --> 39:06.443
And what's that?

39:06.445 --> 39:08.945
(sighs) apologize.

39:08.947 --> 39:12.582
This was not a one-person job.

39:12.584 --> 39:16.553
I'm fine, henrietta, really.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.555
I just got unlucky.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.557
That's not my point.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.059
I have a long leash,

39:23.061 --> 39:27.063
And even I may have gone
too far with this one.

39:27.065 --> 39:30.600
This work is not meant
to be done alone.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.637
Probably not.

39:36.375 --> 39:40.710
But having a team
and a partner-- it's a luxury.

39:43.382 --> 39:46.549
I guess not everyone
can be that lucky.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.553
What if I told you your luck,
as-as you call it,

39:50.555 --> 39:52.822
Could change?

39:58.663 --> 40:00.080
Hey, so, about before...

40:00.081 --> 40:01.498
I didn't mean
to cross a line.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.899
I'm sorry.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.602
Yeah. I know your heart
was in the right place,

40:05.604 --> 40:08.605
And it was really very--
as you said-- gallant,

40:08.607 --> 40:11.541
But I can assure you,
I can handle myself.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.876
Of course.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.446
Was that another talk?

40:16.448 --> 40:18.014
Uh, no.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.483
No, that's what we
call a clarification.

40:20.485 --> 40:21.851
Totally different.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.524
Kensi and deeks
already gone?

40:27.526 --> 40:29.793
(sighs)
they went to get
cleaning supplies.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.528
Oh. (laughs)

40:31.530 --> 40:33.630
Sorry I asked.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.432
Anyway, ricardo pena
wasn't always

40:35.434 --> 40:37.534
On cuba's prisoner
exchange list.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.702
He was added
when russia forgave

40:39.704 --> 40:42.705
Cuba's $32 billion
in debt last August.

40:42.707 --> 40:45.642
So russia strong-armed cuba
into bringing pena home.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.777
You mean,
bringing nulishkin home.

40:47.779 --> 40:52.048
Nulishkin was former kgb,
just like arkady said.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.683
They wanted
their boy back.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.652
Yeah, and nulishkin wanted
to bring a little

40:55.654 --> 40:57.620
American intellectual property
back home with him.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.024
One last hurrah, huh?

41:01.026 --> 41:03.526
Well, see, once everything
was on the table,

41:03.528 --> 41:07.630
Cuba was open to changing
their prisoner request.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.599
So the exchange
for officer seymour

41:09.601 --> 41:11.134
Is still gonna go down
at midnight.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.735
That's great.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.571
Very.
Yeah.

41:15.907 --> 41:16.973
Thanks, guys.

41:18.743 --> 41:19.843
Good night, granger.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.044
Good night, fellas.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.112
Sam:
Good night.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.253
What?

41:32.224 --> 41:34.591
I think
I finally figured you out.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.259
Well, took you long enough.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.795
You're what's know as a
glutton for punishment.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.231
Is this about flying home
from brazil in coach?

41:41.233 --> 41:44.067
I literally cannot fit
in those seats, but, no.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.535
This is about finding my father.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.504
It's a heartfelt moment

41:47.506 --> 41:49.506
That you'll cherish
for the rest of your life.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.641
Think I'd use that
to point out a character flaw?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.243
Character flaw?

41:53.245 --> 41:55.678
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.680
I think you do.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.782
I don't.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.819
Anna.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.188
Uh-huh.
Oh,<i> anna.</i>

42:05.190 --> 42:06.856
Here it comes.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.526
(laughs)
you called her?

42:09.528 --> 42:11.561
We're not gonna talk about this.

42:11.563 --> 42:14.230
I introduce you to a nice
girl from a good family.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.798
Joelle was very sweet.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.668
And who do you go for?
Arkady's daughter.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.803
I'm not saying it's ideal.

42:20.805 --> 42:22.672
The heart wants
what it wants.

42:22.674 --> 42:25.675
Does the heart know it's
gonna need a quadruple bypass

42:25.677 --> 42:27.277
If arkady becomes
your father-in-law?

42:27.279 --> 42:29.646
Can we not make this
a thing, please?

42:29.648 --> 42:31.781
No problem,
no problem.
Thank you.

42:31.783 --> 42:34.317
Sunday barbecues at arkady's,
christmas at arkady's...

42:34.319 --> 42:36.052
Sam...
Okay, okay, okay.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.054
Sam:
<i> Fly fishing with arkady.</i>

42:38.056 --> 42:39.656
