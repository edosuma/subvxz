WEBVTT

00:05.046 --> 00:06.548
My name is Bridget.

00:06.589 --> 00:07.924
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.759
Just get up on the stand

00:09.801 --> 00:11.553
and tell the judge what you saw,
and we'll protect you.

00:11.594 --> 00:12.762
You don't get it.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.140
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.181 --> 00:18.309
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.812
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.230
It was so easy.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.773
I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.942
They all think that I'm her.

00:25.984 --> 00:29.362
Siobhan, I didn't tell you the
whole truth about Tyler Barrett.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.156
It was an accident.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.866
Remember when Dad took
away my trust fund?

00:32.907 --> 00:34.617
My mom came up
with a plan

00:34.659 --> 00:36.411
that she said would
change our lives.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.205
The first step was finding
two willing participants:

00:39.247 --> 00:41.791
Tessa Banner
and Mr. Carpenter.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.585
I believe Daniel Eknath
shot you, Mr. Martin.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.046
He didn't know that
Bridget Kelly had
a twin sister.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.214
And if Bodaway Macawi
believes you're Bridget,

00:48.256 --> 00:50.383
you can bet he'll
come after you again.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.388
DETECTIVE: It was
an accident, right?

00:55.430 --> 00:59.184
Things got
out of control.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.186
You never meant
to kill anyone.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.355
-I didn't do it.
-Yeah?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.357
If you didn't,
who did?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.625
[gunshot]

01:43.520 --> 01:45.897
[siren in distance]

01:47.941 --> 01:49.651
MACHADO: Either of you
recognize this tarot card?

01:49.692 --> 01:53.238
BRIDGET: I'm sorry. It
doesn't mean anything to us.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.537
The man who shot you
was carrying this.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.746
[gasps]

02:01.788 --> 02:03.123
[two gunshots]

02:03.164 --> 02:04.791
He jumped in front
of the bullet.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.086
MACHADO: FBI! Freeze!

02:12.465 --> 02:13.716
We traced it back
to a dry cleaners

02:13.758 --> 02:17.720
that's got ties to
organized crime.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.681
They claimed they used
these things as, uh,

02:19.722 --> 02:21.724
some kind of promotion,
but, yeah, they're up
to something.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.059
Some form of money
laundering,

02:23.101 --> 02:25.270
uh, maybe a dead drop,
using the card.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.647
But how does
Bodaway's henchman fit in?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.691
Daniel Eknath? Uh,
I don't know yet.

02:29.732 --> 02:33.695
We, um...we
located Eknath's van

02:33.736 --> 02:36.698
a few blocks from where
his body was discovered.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.285
[indistinct chatter]

02:43.705 --> 02:45.039
MACHADO:
Daniel Eknath was one of

02:45.081 --> 02:47.208
Bodaway Macawi's lieutenants.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.793
We found a log book inside.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.087
He'd been watching
Malcolm Ward.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.048
He had the address
of Malcolm's hotel
and of Martin/Charles...

02:54.090 --> 02:57.969
and of this apartment.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.930
I think he must've
followed Malcolm here,

03:00.972 --> 03:02.515
saw him with you,

03:02.557 --> 03:04.184
and that's when he
mistook you for Bridget.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.811
I wish I could tell you
you're out of harm's way

03:06.853 --> 03:08.938
now that Eknath's
dead, but...

03:08.980 --> 03:11.566
he could've reported
back to Bodaway that
he found Malcolm

03:11.608 --> 03:13.943
and that he thought
he found Bridget.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.779
Believe me, I'm doing
everything in my power

03:16.821 --> 03:18.239
to keep you both safe.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.284
And that's supposed
to reassure us, is it?

03:21.326 --> 03:24.662
Was everything in your power
enough to keep Malcolm safe?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.706
-Andrew.
-No, let's face it.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.834
After you convinced Malcolm
to testify, he disappeared

03:29.876 --> 03:31.419
or worse.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.546
I've been shot.
My wife was nearly killed.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.423
How many more people
are going to be hurt

03:35.465 --> 03:37.675
because of your
incompetence?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.769
I've arranged for NYPD
to put a couple men

03:47.810 --> 03:49.938
outside your apartment
and at Andrew's office.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.898
I'll be in touch.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.444
Andrew...
Andrew...

03:56.486 --> 03:59.656
come on. It's...
it's not his fault.

03:59.697 --> 04:00.907
The person that attacked
me six months ago

04:00.949 --> 04:02.116
couldn't have been
Eknath.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.118
He wasn't even
in town yet.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.121
Unless Machado's wrong
about that, too.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.915
This isn't about me.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.793
It's about my sister and
the mess that she made.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.087
If you want to
blame anyone,

04:14.128 --> 04:16.589
you blame Bridget.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.679
Hey, uh, I'm not sure why
you're not answering my calls,

04:22.720 --> 04:24.180
but it's very important
that we speak.

04:24.222 --> 04:28.059
So, please, Tim,
call me back.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.062
No luck getting through
to Arbogast?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.605
Uh-uh.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.190
What about when
Bev dropped the boys off?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.067
Did she say anything,

04:36.109 --> 04:37.485
give you any reason
he's avoiding you?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.987
No.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.405
[sighs] Henry, we need
to get that flash drive.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.823
It's the only proof
we have that

04:41.864 --> 04:44.242
Martin/Charles
is running a Ponzi scheme.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.868
-I know.
-What about the boys?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.453
You can call Arbogast,
tell him,

04:47.495 --> 04:50.081
they miss him
and they want to see him.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.209
I am not using my kids
as bait.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.630
OK, I...I get it.
I'm sorry.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.052
Siobhan...

05:03.094 --> 05:06.222
what if we don't
get it back?

05:06.264 --> 05:07.473
I mean, your whole
plan has hinged

05:07.515 --> 05:09.225
on one thing:
your belief

05:09.267 --> 05:10.768
that Andrew wanted
you dead.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.895
You let your sister
take the hit,

05:12.937 --> 05:15.231
so Andrew would go
to jail for her murder.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.526
But Andrew just took
a bullet for a woman
he thought was you.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.445
So, crazy as it sounds,

05:20.486 --> 05:22.780
Bridget and Andrew's
marriage, it's working.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.657
Now, Either Andrew,

05:24.699 --> 05:27.160
he never put out that
hit in the first place

05:27.201 --> 05:29.078
or he changed
his mind.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.664
And if he changed his
mind, what is our plan?

05:31.706 --> 05:34.584
Are we just going to keep
waiting and scheming,

05:34.625 --> 05:36.711
banking on an
increasingly dim chance

05:36.753 --> 05:38.004
that Bridget pisses
off Andrew enough

05:38.046 --> 05:40.381
for him to try
to kill her again?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.633
What exactly are
you getting at?

05:42.675 --> 05:45.845
We let Arbogast
have the flash drive.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.597
We let him blow the whistle
on Martin/Charles.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.682
Andrew will not go
to jail for murder.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.309
But look at Bernie Madoff.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.977
Andrew can still
serve life,

05:53.019 --> 05:54.479
and you can still
reclaim your identity

05:54.520 --> 05:56.272
once he's put away.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.028
What, what is
holding you back?

06:06.157 --> 06:08.201
You asked me how I've
been paying for everything.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.286
When I was in Paris,

06:10.328 --> 06:12.455
Tyler Barrett helped me
set up some dummy accounts

06:12.497 --> 06:15.124
at Martin/Charles.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.294
I've been using those
to siphon funds
from the company.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.463
This isn't about
the money anymore.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.465
This is about a life

06:22.507 --> 06:24.801
that we can finally
start living together.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.761
So, whatever you have,
it'll have to be enough.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.764
I will make sure that
Arbogast blows the whistle.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.725
And then we can start
putting all this behind us.

06:32.767 --> 06:36.354
Look, I know that this is
not your perfect revenge.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.147
Bridget won't die.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.067
And I know, I know
what she did to you,

06:41.109 --> 06:42.944
to us.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.987
And I know how hard
it is to let go.

06:45.029 --> 06:49.534
But if we are going to try
to build a life together...

06:49.575 --> 06:51.744
we have to try.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.626
ANDREW: Byron, these
rumors of instability

06:58.668 --> 07:00.628
are completely unfounded.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.755
Olivia had been looking to leave
for some time now.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.841
We'd been planning her exit
for months.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.551
Yes, she was an asset,

07:06.592 --> 07:08.261
but her absence
has had zero impact

07:08.302 --> 07:10.012
on the service we provide.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.722
If anything, it's given
us a great opportunity

07:11.764 --> 07:13.558
to find some fresh blood
at the fund.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.601
Of course, if you
have any more questions,

07:15.643 --> 07:17.270
don't hesitate to call.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.313
Thanks, Byron.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.773
More investor calls?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.233
Word's out about
Olivia's departure

07:22.275 --> 07:23.443
and my little accident.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.319
Daddy, don't be
so Welsh.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.530
You can say, "I got shot."
It'll give you street cred.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.031
[phone rings]

07:29.073 --> 07:31.826
And another.
I'll see you in the car?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.202
Yeah.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.289
See you later.
Love you. Saquine?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.625
What time are you
meeting Catherine?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.711
4:30, but you know her,
she'll probably be late.

07:41.752 --> 07:42.920
Juliet, I really
don't like the idea

07:42.962 --> 07:44.380
of you being
in the same room with her

07:44.422 --> 07:45.798
after everything that
she's put you through.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.093
OK, I know, but I'm
doing this for Daddy.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.013
The thing about seeing him
with a hole in his chest?

07:52.054 --> 07:54.098
It kind of makes me
want to be the perfect
daughter right now.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.601
But it's not too late.
We can talk to your dad.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.603
That conversation is

07:58.644 --> 08:00.771
the last thing he
needs right now.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.112
[sighs]

08:17.538 --> 08:18.956
[line ringing]

08:18.998 --> 08:20.166
WOMAN: Rock Springs
Police Department.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.417
How may I help you?

08:21.459 --> 08:23.002
Yes, Detective
Jimmy Kemper, please.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.046
I'm sorry.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.049
Detective Kemper is no
longer with this department.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.300
So where is he?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.843
They wouldn't tell me.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.262
So, I went online,
and I did some research.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.056
Jimmy Kemper's in prison
for the murders

08:35.097 --> 08:37.725
of Mary Curtis
and Shaylene Briggs.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.644
Maybe he was framed.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.188
That's what I thought
at first, but he confessed.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.898
I know he didn't
kill Shaylene

08:43.940 --> 08:46.275
because I was there.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.277
I saw Bodaway do it.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.073
Jimmy's the one
who convinced me

08:52.114 --> 08:54.492
that it wasn't safe
to testify.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.453
-You're not safe.
-I'm calling Machado.

08:57.495 --> 09:00.081
Don't. Half the Bureau's
on Bodaway's payroll.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.333
If you testify against him
tomorrow, you're dead.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.377
We can't trust the Feds.

09:04.418 --> 09:08.631
When I signed on to protect
you, I did my research.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.174
Machado's a good cop.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.842
A bit obsessed
with Bodaway,

09:11.884 --> 09:13.886
but he's not dirty.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.305
So you think
I trusted the wrong guy?

09:18.849 --> 09:20.351
Andrew told me everything
that's happened

09:20.393 --> 09:22.812
is Machado's fault,

09:22.853 --> 09:25.314
but it's mine.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.692
And If I would have
just stayed and testified

09:27.733 --> 09:30.570
like I was supposed to, none
of this would have happened.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.155
Gemma would be alive, Andrew
wouldn't have been shot,

09:33.197 --> 09:35.116
and Malcolm...

09:35.157 --> 09:37.326
Well, you didn't
call Jimmy Kemper

09:37.368 --> 09:38.911
out of curiosity.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.330
What's this about,
Bridget?

09:41.372 --> 09:43.291
I can't just sit back
and watch anymore.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.376
I'm going to do

09:45.418 --> 09:47.920
what I should have done
a long time ago.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.047
I'm going to testify.

09:54.844 --> 09:59.265
Solicitation
and possession with intent.

09:59.307 --> 10:03.060
How many, how many years
you facing again?

10:03.102 --> 10:04.520
You're FBI, right?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.522
Don't you have
bigger fish to fry?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.858
Oh, no. No, no. Don't play
dumb with me, Miss Kelly.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.819
I-I know you were
there that night.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.154
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.530
Club Caged.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.948
The night of
Shaylene Briggs' murder.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.950
Bodaway Macawi
had a little party,

10:17.992 --> 10:19.577
and I have it
on very good authority

10:19.619 --> 10:21.454
that you were
in attendance.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.542
You saw something, right,
that night,

10:26.584 --> 10:29.170
that made you flee?

10:29.211 --> 10:31.881
Hey, hey.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.382
It's understandable, OK?

10:33.424 --> 10:36.177
Bodaway's a very scary man.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.595
You ran, right,
as far as what

10:37.637 --> 10:39.138
little money you had
could take you?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.475
No? You stalled right out
here at the Nevada border?

10:42.516 --> 10:44.685
Bridget?

10:44.727 --> 10:46.729
And you needed money, right,
and some way to eat?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.230
Some way to score?

10:48.272 --> 10:49.774
That's where
the solicitation charge...

10:49.815 --> 10:52.818
Spare me the recap.
I want my lawyer.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.987
A lawyer you can afford

10:55.029 --> 10:56.989
is not going to help you
avoid jail time.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.494
Come on, just...

11:01.535 --> 11:03.120
[sighs]

11:03.162 --> 11:04.997
Just tell me what happened.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.166
If you have what I need
to put Bodaway in jail--

11:07.208 --> 11:10.002
and I have a strong feeling
you do--I will.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.841
Maybe I'm safer
behind bars.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.218
Well, I hate
to burst your bubble,

11:17.259 --> 11:19.261
but Macawi's got people
on the inside;

11:19.303 --> 11:20.554
The only safe
place for you, Bridget,

11:20.596 --> 11:22.598
is Witness Protection
after you testify.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.225
And it's
a whole new life.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.726
And if you'll pardon me,

11:25.768 --> 11:27.603
you look like
you could use one.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.034
If you're not going to do it
for yourself, then...

11:42.076 --> 11:43.869
then why don't you do it
for...for Shaylene?

11:43.911 --> 11:45.913
She...she was
your friend, right?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.873
From what I understand,
you know,

11:47.915 --> 11:50.084
she looked out for you.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.838
I mean, the way I see it,

11:53.879 --> 11:55.464
it's time to repay the favor.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.731
If you can keep
me safe...

12:11.772 --> 12:15.192
and put that
monster away,

12:15.234 --> 12:16.652
I'll testify.

12:20.489 --> 12:23.367
I'll do it;
I'll testify.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.416
I made a promise that
I can't ignore anymore.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.293
I'm sorry.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.295
It's just that I feel
a certain responsibility

12:34.336 --> 12:36.297
for your safety,

12:36.338 --> 12:37.715
and I don't know how
to help you with this.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.301
That's OK.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.554
I think I know
someone who can.

12:48.058 --> 12:51.103
[phone vibrating]

12:56.650 --> 12:58.110
[phone beeps]

12:58.152 --> 13:01.071
[entrance bells jingling]

13:07.661 --> 13:10.331
[camera shutter clicking]

13:20.007 --> 13:21.425
[door opens,
entrance bells jingling]

13:38.901 --> 13:41.362
Hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.657
Mind if I take a look
at that suit?

13:44.698 --> 13:46.367
I think it's probably

13:46.408 --> 13:48.118
a little out of your
price range, Officer.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.502
You happy now?
Can I go?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.883
Anything you want
to tell me?

14:02.925 --> 14:04.635
No?

14:05.928 --> 14:09.306
Wow. Want to explain this?

14:11.392 --> 14:13.394
I-I know this place
is connected, OK?

14:13.435 --> 14:14.979
Th-the tarot cards
are, what...?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.188
They're, like,
markers, right?

14:16.230 --> 14:18.065
Like a claim check
for something?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.775
You're gonna tell
me everything

14:19.817 --> 14:21.402
-you know about this place.
-I don't have to talk to you.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.612
If you want to get your hands
on that money again, you do.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.077
[man grunting]

14:30.119 --> 14:31.620
[panting]

14:31.662 --> 14:33.414
You know, I've been
following this case

14:33.455 --> 14:35.416
too long with
too little to show for it,

14:35.457 --> 14:38.127
to let a smug-faced punk
like you get in my way.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.007
You're going to
tell me everything

14:43.048 --> 14:44.216
you know about that place,

14:44.258 --> 14:45.801
and you're going
to tell me now.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.636
What do you know about the
owner, huh, Remy Osterman?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.930
What do you know about him?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.348
Huh?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.558
How about
Bodaway Macawi, huh?

14:58.105 --> 14:59.523
-Unh!
-Yeah?

14:59.565 --> 15:00.733
[grunting]

15:00.774 --> 15:02.026
BYSTANDER:
He jacked him up, man.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.652
-Jacked him up.
-Did you see that?

15:03.694 --> 15:04.987
He worked
that guy over.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.530
Check this out.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.823
Somebody call
the police.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.326
BYSTANDER:
Somebody call
an ambulance.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.411
[cell phone cameras snapping]

15:15.539 --> 15:17.207
[elevator bell dings]

15:20.336 --> 15:22.463
Aw, my angel.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.341
Mmm...

15:25.382 --> 15:26.800
You've come back to me.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.928
No, I didn't come here
to make up.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.346
Dad said I had to.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.555
He said after
running away from you,

15:31.597 --> 15:34.475
I owed you
an "in-person apology."

15:34.516 --> 15:37.144
Besides, I want something.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.279
OK. Look, Daddy's
struggling at work.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.448
I mean, really,
really struggling.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.617
And investors are freaking
since Olivia split.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.077
He's having
money problems

15:53.118 --> 15:54.787
just trying to keep
the company afloat.

15:54.828 --> 15:57.414
First he sold the loft,
and now I guess

15:57.456 --> 15:59.959
he's even selling the
house in Palm Springs.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.293
Oh, who cares?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.962
Palm Springs is for
gays and old people.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.713
Mom, we spent, like,

16:04.755 --> 16:07.549
every winter of
my childhood there,

16:07.591 --> 16:09.718
and I really love
that place.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.221
Oh, honey, I know
it has its charm,

16:12.262 --> 16:14.348
but your father is
setting himself up
for disappointment

16:14.390 --> 16:16.767
if he thinks selling
that property
in this market

16:16.809 --> 16:18.686
is going to be enough
to prop him up.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.522
Apparently,
it must be worth something.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.691
He's already got a buyer
sniffing around.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.234
I snooped
on Daddy's computer,

16:25.275 --> 16:27.528
and I found an email
inquiring about the land.

16:27.569 --> 16:32.616
It was some guy named...
Tobias Schecht or something.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.159
Schecht?

16:34.201 --> 16:35.911
Yeah. Do you know him?

16:35.953 --> 16:39.123
No. It's just
an interesting name.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.709
Anyways, I deleted the email
before Daddy could read it.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.252
Daddy shouldn't have
to give up anything else

16:43.293 --> 16:45.087
because of what we've done.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.131
[sighs]

16:47.172 --> 16:51.385
And... I want you
to buy the property.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.178
That way, the house
can stay in the family.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.180
Oh, Juliet, really...

16:55.222 --> 16:56.765
I know you can afford it.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.977
You have my money,
Tessa's money,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.854
and if I had to guess,

17:01.895 --> 17:03.355
you probably managed to get

17:03.397 --> 17:05.566
your hands on Mr. C's
cut, too.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.151
Well, how would I explain

17:07.192 --> 17:09.111
having that kind of money
to buy that property?

17:09.153 --> 17:11.321
Come up with a lie.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.449
You're really good at that.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.910
Hey, Tim.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.162
Tim, I've been
calling you.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.830
And I've been
avoiding you.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.123
Listen, can...

17:21.165 --> 17:23.167
can we please
just talk?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.009
First you get me to
invest in Martin/Charles,

17:32.051 --> 17:35.512
then you imply there's
something fishy going on.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.097
I don't like being
jerked around, Henry.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.557
I know, and I'm sorry.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.017
I had no idea

17:40.059 --> 17:41.226
that there was anything
wrong with the fund

17:41.268 --> 17:43.187
when I convinced
you to invest.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.773
Like an idiot, I thought
I was doing you a favor.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.150
That's why as soon
as I got wind

17:48.192 --> 17:50.444
that something shady
was going on,

17:50.486 --> 17:53.697
I brought you the proof.

17:53.739 --> 17:57.326
I've been studying the
contents of this drive,

17:57.367 --> 17:59.161
comparing this data

17:59.203 --> 18:01.038
with Martin/Charles'
public reporting.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.208
The fund's a scam.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.335
How did you get
your hands on this?

18:06.376 --> 18:10.464
I overheard Andrew
and Olivia talking...

18:10.506 --> 18:13.050
and when Andrew left me
alone in his office,

18:13.092 --> 18:15.844
I went on his computer
and I copied some files,

18:15.886 --> 18:18.013
because I had a feeling

18:18.055 --> 18:19.765
that you would know
what to do with it, Tim.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.561
Well, you did
the right thing.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.355
You realize, once
this fund is exposed,

18:26.396 --> 18:28.732
its investors are going
to lose everything
they put into it,

18:28.774 --> 18:31.276
me included.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.569
You know me, Henry.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.029
I hate to lose money.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.493
Hey, Tim.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.162
What are you going to do?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.664
Don't worry, son.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.499
I'll do what's best.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.503
I-I couldn't let him
slip away

18:49.545 --> 18:51.046
without getting
something solid.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.465
Look, I-I-I've never
lost it like that before.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.467
Yeah, Vic,
the way I see it,

18:55.509 --> 18:57.010
this wasn't
an isolated incident.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.762
-Oh, come on.
-In fact, I'd call it a pattern.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.472
Jimmy Kemper?

19:00.514 --> 19:03.225
That little
jailhouse rough-up
you had arranged?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.935
What?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.812
Didn't think I'd figure
out that was you?

19:06.854 --> 19:08.897
The regional director
knows all about it, too.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.024
She's the one who suggested
I rush out here after
you had your little

19:11.066 --> 19:12.818
"photo op" in front
of the dry cleaners.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.820
Go ahead and reassign me,
Torrance, all right?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.280
Just don't drop
the ball on this.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.782
I know Eknath is connected
to Finer Dry Cleaners,

19:18.824 --> 19:20.033
which means Bodaway
is connected to them.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.827
No. No, it doesn't.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.078
Eknath hasn't
communicated

19:23.120 --> 19:24.746
with Bodaway in months.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.082
We had a wire
on his phone.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.501
Thought we finally had
a way into Bodaway's
organization,

19:29.543 --> 19:31.670
but Bodaway
cut Eknath loose

19:31.712 --> 19:33.964
after Eknath let
Malcolm Ward escape.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.884
So whatever he was doing
here in New York...

19:36.925 --> 19:38.760
he wasn't here
on Bodaway's orders.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.929
How long have you been
sitting on this information?

19:40.971 --> 19:42.848
I haven't been "sitting"
on anything, Vic.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.308
Maybe you'd be
in the loop

19:44.349 --> 19:46.143
if you'd been back in
Wyoming doing your job

19:46.185 --> 19:49.271
instead of out here chasing
another phantom witness!

19:49.313 --> 19:51.190
If Eknath was cut loose,
it doesn't mean he
wasn't trying...

19:51.231 --> 19:52.733
It doesn't matter;
it's over.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.151
It's not over,
and it does matter!

19:54.193 --> 19:55.360
It is over!

19:55.402 --> 19:56.570
Over.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.491
Hand over your badge
and your gun.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.382
Tobias Schecht?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.134
Yes.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.386
I'm Catherine Martin.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.180
Andrew got tied up at work.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.182
He sends his regrets.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.767
Well, I-I was surprised

20:26.808 --> 20:28.644
to get such a speedy
response to my inquiry.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.812
Or such a personal one.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.564
Oh, that is just the way

20:32.606 --> 20:34.358
my husband and I
do business, Toby.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.193
May I call you Toby?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.986
Yes.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.155
As you know,
I am interested

20:40.197 --> 20:42.157
in your property
in Palm Springs.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.493
So, tell me Toby, what is
your interest in the land?

20:44.534 --> 20:47.412
Well, I've always wanted to
build a vacation retreat,

20:47.454 --> 20:49.581
but most of the lots
in Palm Springs

20:49.623 --> 20:51.416
are too close to town

20:51.458 --> 20:53.502
or, quite frankly,
too small.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.379
You don't have to tell me.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.756
Certainly the house
would have to be
rebuilt from scratch,

20:57.798 --> 21:01.176
but in terms of
sheer acreage,

21:01.218 --> 21:02.594
it can't be beat.

21:02.636 --> 21:06.014
And there is something
about the desert,

21:06.056 --> 21:07.474
don't you think?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.186
Let's cut the crap, Toby.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.063
Excuse me?

21:13.105 --> 21:14.606
I know who you are.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.484
Tobias Schecht of
Schecht Green Strategies.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.820
And you honestly
expect me to believe

21:19.861 --> 21:21.655
that a big-time
green energy investor

21:21.697 --> 21:23.323
is sniffing around
desert property

21:23.365 --> 21:26.451
to buy a mid-century
modern?

21:26.493 --> 21:29.037
I think that you're less
interested in our land

21:29.079 --> 21:31.206
than in the massive
quantities

21:31.248 --> 21:33.208
of energy-rich wind
passing through it.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.085
You get your hands
on our land,

21:35.127 --> 21:37.629
you stand to make
a lot of money.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.506
It's nothing to
be embarrassed about.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.427
I find wind turbines
very sexy.

21:45.804 --> 21:51.393
Well, you've got me,
Mrs. Martin...

21:51.435 --> 21:54.521
but that doesn't change
the fact that I still
want your land.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.648
The question is:

21:56.690 --> 21:58.442
Can we arrive at

21:58.483 --> 22:01.570
a mutually
satisfying figure?

22:01.611 --> 22:03.655
We can try.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.966
Thanks for meeting
with me, Agent Machado.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.262
Why don't you call me
"Vic" instead?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.889
Apparently, your husband
is not the only one

22:28.930 --> 22:31.475
who's not happy with
the way I do my job.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.685
I got suspended today.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.146
I'm genuinely sorry
to hear that.

22:36.188 --> 22:40.067
And your protective
detail was pulled.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.819
Apparently, Eknath was
no longer working
for Bodaway,

22:42.861 --> 22:46.615
so my boss decided
that you and your
family were safe.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.408
But you disagree?

22:50.160 --> 22:53.372
Bodaway threw Eknath out
of his organization.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.415
What if Eknath was
trying to kill Malcolm

22:55.457 --> 22:57.918
or your sister
as a way to get back
in his good graces?

22:57.959 --> 23:01.004
What if Eknath had
an accomplice?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.923
They mistook you
for Bridget once.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.675
I mean, there's
no guarantee it
couldn't happen again.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.011
That's actually why
I called you.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.013
What if we could use that
to our advantage?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.015
Let me testify
against Bodaway.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.143
As my sister.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.395
Think about it.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.729
She told you everything
that she saw.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.147
You've been over
her testimony.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.233
You tell me what to say,
and I will say it.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.528
Mrs. Martin, that's,
uh, illegal. Heh.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.029
In fact, they'd have
to invent

23:26.071 --> 23:27.948
a whole
new class of perjury

23:27.989 --> 23:29.658
to describe
what this is.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.952
But where is
this coming from?

23:31.993 --> 23:35.205
Bodaway's hurt
too many people.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.541
My sister may not have been
willing to testify,

23:37.582 --> 23:39.459
but...I am.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.461
But you'd be the one
in Bodaway's crosshairs,

23:41.503 --> 23:44.423
not your sister.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.883
I...

23:46.925 --> 23:49.177
I don't know
that I can risk having

23:49.219 --> 23:51.138
any more blood
on my hands.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.562
My sister talked to me
about you

23:58.603 --> 24:01.189
before she ran.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.734
She wondered why you were
so driven to catch Bodaway.

24:04.776 --> 24:08.196
It started out just
like any other case,

24:08.238 --> 24:09.906
but, um...

24:13.118 --> 24:14.578
that changed

24:14.619 --> 24:17.539
when he-he murdered
an informant of mine.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.458
Her name was Shaylene.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.714
BRIDGET: Guess who Bodaway
asked for a private dance.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.048
Rico the bouncer.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.592
That's cute, Shay.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.094
I just keep thinking
if I get in good
with the boss,

24:31.136 --> 24:32.762
I could actually
get a decent shift

24:32.804 --> 24:34.222
around here.

24:34.264 --> 24:37.684
Bridget, he's
dangerous OK?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.644
I don't want you too
close if he gets...

24:39.686 --> 24:42.314
If what?

24:42.355 --> 24:43.690
Bridget, listen.

24:43.732 --> 24:48.028
Just... be careful
around him, OK?

24:48.069 --> 24:49.779
OK.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.449
So you coming home tonight or
is this another night spent

24:52.491 --> 24:54.034
with Mr. Wonderful?

24:54.075 --> 24:55.410
You know, if he's so great,

24:55.452 --> 24:57.037
when do I get
to actually to meet him?

24:57.078 --> 24:58.830
No, I'm not
jinxing this one

24:58.872 --> 25:00.290
by talking about it.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.960
But if things go the
way we want them to,

25:04.002 --> 25:05.545
I shouldn't have
to keep him a secret

25:05.587 --> 25:06.796
much longer.

25:06.838 --> 25:10.008
You were in love with her?

25:12.135 --> 25:15.889
It's written
all over your face.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.643
I promised Shaylene that
I would keep her safe,

25:19.684 --> 25:22.062
and I failed.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.897
No, you didn't.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.274
Yeah, I think I'm finally
getting the message.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.901
Punishing Bodaway
is not as important

25:27.943 --> 25:29.653
as keeping
innocent people safe,

25:29.694 --> 25:31.988
so I'm sorry.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.495
I used all the buzzwords:
"growth potential,"

25:38.537 --> 25:40.497
"structural optimization."

25:40.539 --> 25:42.082
Let them infer that

25:42.123 --> 25:43.542
the company will only do
better without Olivia.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.465
Look, can we finish
this in the morning?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.884
Thanks.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.302
Rough day?

25:54.344 --> 25:56.346
An understatement.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.099
You have been through
so much lately:

25:59.140 --> 26:01.977
the shooting,
money troubles.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.312
I've been trying to think
of ways to help.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.481
The Palm Springs property--
Juliet told me

26:06.523 --> 26:08.108
that you're putting it
on the market,

26:08.149 --> 26:09.943
and I would like to buy it.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.112
Direct sale. It'd save
you the time and expense

26:12.153 --> 26:13.697
of going through
an agent,

26:13.738 --> 26:16.658
and this way, you can
keep it in the family.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.369
Tell me, what takes you
from pleading poverty

26:19.411 --> 26:22.330
a few months ago to making
a play for real estate?

26:22.372 --> 26:24.082
You remember Aunt Miriam?

26:24.124 --> 26:25.584
Her estate finally cleared,

26:25.625 --> 26:27.460
and she left me everything.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.170
It should be more
than enough

26:29.212 --> 26:30.672
to buy the land outright.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.465
How much are you
willing to pay?

26:32.507 --> 26:34.551
3 million.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.262
Does that help you?

26:42.726 --> 26:45.145
Nice try.

26:45.186 --> 26:47.939
The land's worth three
times that at least.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.941
Not to mention,
we both know

26:49.983 --> 26:52.277
you've never done
an altruistic thing
in your life.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.279
[sighs]

26:54.321 --> 26:55.530
[chuckles]

27:02.746 --> 27:05.123
OK, Andrew,
you got me.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.375
I deliberately
lowballed you.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.377
I wouldn't have expected
anything less.

27:09.419 --> 27:12.964
I thought that you and
Siobhan were teetotaling?

27:13.006 --> 27:14.674
Well, today's
an exception.

27:14.716 --> 27:15.967
Hmm.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.219
Would you make
an exception for me?

27:21.014 --> 27:22.515
You were right,

27:22.557 --> 27:24.351
I did have
ulterior motives,

27:24.392 --> 27:27.103
but this time
they were pure.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.856
Catherine, you are
many things,

27:29.898 --> 27:32.025
but pure?

27:32.067 --> 27:34.194
Well, by my standards.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.615
Juliet just loves
that house so much,

27:38.657 --> 27:41.201
I thought I could
spare her from
having to give it up.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.661
I am with you--

27:42.702 --> 27:44.037
that house is a pit--

27:44.079 --> 27:46.831
but the way that she
spoke about it today,

27:46.873 --> 27:48.416
you know, I guess
we never realized

27:48.458 --> 27:50.001
that it means
so much to her.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.003
We did have some pretty
good times in that place.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.048
Mm.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.925
Do you remember
the spider?

27:56.966 --> 27:59.052
Mm, you mean
the tarantula.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.013
Right. That thing must
have been, what,
like, six inches.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.765
I was jumping
up and down,

28:03.807 --> 28:06.309
Juliet was pulling
her hair out, and you...

28:06.351 --> 28:08.019
I got it out of the house,
didn't I?

28:08.061 --> 28:10.814
Oh, after chasing it
around the bathroom
for six hours!

28:10.855 --> 28:12.607
[both laugh]

28:12.649 --> 28:14.234
Oh...

28:14.275 --> 28:15.443
[sighs]

28:15.485 --> 28:17.612
But you did get it out.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.031
Our hero.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.202
You always
were our hero.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.290
And then after,

28:29.332 --> 28:31.668
to repay you...
remember?

28:44.305 --> 28:46.850
Catherine...

28:46.891 --> 28:48.852
Is that a no?

28:48.893 --> 28:52.856
It's a no to the kiss.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.775
But you make me
a fair offer,

28:55.817 --> 28:58.069
I'll sell you the land.

29:06.202 --> 29:10.290
Well, I guess I'll, uh...
leave you to your whiskey.

29:10.331 --> 29:14.043
I appreciate
your time, Vic.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.921
What, what, what if
there's another way

29:16.963 --> 29:19.549
to keep you
and your family safe?

29:24.929 --> 29:27.098
Do you trust me?

29:27.140 --> 29:28.600
Excuse me?

29:28.641 --> 29:29.809
I know I haven't
exactly earned it.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.311
I just need to know.

29:35.231 --> 29:36.858
Yeah, I do trust you.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.693
OK.

29:38.735 --> 29:41.029
Well, Bodaway
and his crew, they're
gonna be a threat to you

29:41.070 --> 29:42.322
and your family

29:42.363 --> 29:44.657
until they see
your sister dead.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.701
So let's beat them
to the punch.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.791
Let's kill Bridget.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.384
Kill...Bridget?

30:05.428 --> 30:07.931
We dress you up
to look like her.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.974
We shoot video
of your "dead body."

30:10.016 --> 30:11.726
We make it look like
Bridget was killed

30:11.768 --> 30:13.144
in some drug deal
gone bad

30:13.186 --> 30:14.896
in a flophouse
or something.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.648
We leak that footage,

30:16.689 --> 30:19.108
and the word gets around
that she's dead.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.568
No one's gonna take
the time to search

30:20.610 --> 30:22.862
for the body of
a fugitive drug addict.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.864
So when no body
surfaces, I mean,

30:24.906 --> 30:27.033
no one's gonna even
bat an eye.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.744
You want to keep
your family safe
from Bodaway...

30:29.786 --> 30:31.120
for good?

30:40.964 --> 30:42.757
[soft rustling]

30:47.679 --> 30:48.847
BRIDGET: Hello?

31:07.991 --> 31:10.702
Juliet?

31:10.743 --> 31:11.953
Bridget.

31:14.747 --> 31:17.083
Siobhan?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.418
Wh...

31:18.459 --> 31:20.461
How is this possible?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.801
I keep asking myself...

31:26.843 --> 31:28.553
how did you do it?

31:30.430 --> 31:33.892
Back in Tahoe, you destroyed
everything you touched:

31:33.933 --> 31:35.643
your life...

31:35.685 --> 31:37.437
my life!

31:37.478 --> 31:39.856
But somehow,
when you became me,

31:39.898 --> 31:41.649
you made it work.

31:42.859 --> 31:46.404
Andrew loves you.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.990
What do you have
that I don't?

31:50.658 --> 31:51.868
[scoffs]

31:55.079 --> 31:57.665
But Henry's right.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.209
I need to move on.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.130
I need to forgive you.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.548
[gasps]

32:05.590 --> 32:08.134
But I can't.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.812
You're my lawyer, not my friend.
I don't want your advice.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.814
Yes, $10 million is
a high price to pay,

32:21.856 --> 32:24.943
but it's a steal compared to
what I'm gonna get back for it.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.277
OK, look, just tell me.

32:26.319 --> 32:29.197
Did you wire Andrew
the money or not?

32:29.238 --> 32:30.406
Good.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.367
Look, I gotta go.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.327
I'm meeting Schecht
to close on the sale.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.877
-Hello.
-Hi.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.217
Andrew...

32:49.258 --> 32:52.136
darling,
what are you doing here?

32:52.178 --> 32:54.472
Beating you at your
own game...darling.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.057
Toby, thank you
so much.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.351
I couldn't have
done this without you.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.144
Well, I owed you
one, buddy.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.897
And besides...
it was fun.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.530
What have you done?

33:10.571 --> 33:12.532
Juliet told me
everything.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.911
Daddy?

33:16.953 --> 33:18.371
Juliet.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.289
Siobhan gave me
a deadline.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.750
She said either
I tell you tonight or...

33:22.792 --> 33:25.294
she'd tell you herself.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.422
How you planned the fake
rape with Carpenter,

33:27.463 --> 33:28.756
how you manipulated
me into

33:28.798 --> 33:30.758
leading the charge
against him,

33:30.800 --> 33:34.512
all so I'd have to
settle and pay up when
the case fell apart.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.139
I'm so sorry.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.807
Please, just, can you
just say something?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.809
I mean, anything, please.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.353
Juliet, I'm sorry.
I just need a moment.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.938
You fleeced me.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.566
But the really
twisted thing--

33:46.607 --> 33:48.568
you almost tore me
and Juliet apart.

33:48.609 --> 33:54.157
Daddy... I know you
have every reason

33:54.198 --> 33:56.659
to blame me for what
happened, but I--

33:56.701 --> 33:58.953
Rest assured, when
I set your punishment,

33:58.995 --> 34:00.747
it's going to make
your last grounding

34:00.788 --> 34:02.874
feel like a holiday.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.376
I'm very disappointed
in you, Juliet.

34:06.836 --> 34:09.088
But there was one thing
left to unite us--

34:10.923 --> 34:13.217
how sick of you we are.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.219
We all had our part
to play

34:15.261 --> 34:17.221
in getting my money
back from you.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.390
It was a real
family effort.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.808
By the way,
the land's worth

34:20.850 --> 34:22.602
quite a bit less
than what you paid.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.479
But who knows?

34:24.520 --> 34:26.147
The Palm Spring real estate
market turns around,

34:26.189 --> 34:28.816
you could recoup your
losses in a couple of...

34:28.858 --> 34:30.818
decades.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.154
You bastard.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.156
And the last
I checked...

34:35.198 --> 34:37.700
courts don't look
too fondly on parents

34:37.742 --> 34:39.911
who use their daughters
to commit fraud.

34:41.996 --> 34:45.083
Your days as a mother,
they're over.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.753
You so much as come
within a city block

34:48.795 --> 34:50.338
of Juliet, I'll have

34:50.379 --> 34:52.215
your parental rights
stripped so fast

34:52.256 --> 34:53.925
your head will spin.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.638
Have a nice life,
Catherine.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.030
[pounding on door]

35:17.698 --> 35:20.409
Good morning, Mr. Butler.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.078
Detective Towers.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.579
What are you
doing here?

35:23.621 --> 35:24.997
We'd like you to come
with us to the precinct.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.290
We have some questions
to ask you.

35:26.332 --> 35:27.792
About what?

35:27.834 --> 35:29.460
The murder of Tyler Barrett.

35:34.757 --> 35:37.468
[electricity crackling]

35:44.851 --> 35:46.561
You know, if I didn't
know any better,

35:46.602 --> 35:48.062
I'd swear you
were Bridget.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.856
You'd think we were twins.

35:49.897 --> 35:52.275
So I gonna have you
lie on this.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.865
I know, Mrs. Martin, not
exactly what you're used to.

35:58.906 --> 36:01.993
Oh, and I almost
forgot the fun part.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.706
Fake blood.

36:06.747 --> 36:08.624
Mm. The fun part.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.962
[phone ringing]

36:13.004 --> 36:14.172
Hey, Solomon.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.715
Just checking in,

36:15.756 --> 36:17.341
wondering if you're still
planning to testify.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.219
No, actually, I've decided
on a different plan.

36:20.261 --> 36:23.556
But I think this one
is gonna keep me safe.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.251
[sighs]
You ready?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.920
Yeah, just a second.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.463
Uh, why don't you just go
ahead and lie on that,

36:55.504 --> 36:56.756
face that way.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.382
I think this
battery's dead.

36:58.424 --> 36:59.634
Gonna go
change it out.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.093
Just make yourself
comfortable.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.142
SNIPER [whispers]:
Damn it.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.240
-I didn't do it.
-Yeah?

37:22.281 --> 37:23.991
If you didn't, who did?

37:24.033 --> 37:26.702
We got a tip linking
you to the crime.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.287
Once we started looking,

37:28.329 --> 37:29.789
we found surveillance
footage

37:29.830 --> 37:31.874
that puts you
at the scene.

37:31.916 --> 37:35.586
You have more questions,
you can ask my lawyer.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.338
You ever heard of
Hubble & Meyer?

37:37.380 --> 37:39.632
They're a top-flight
firm, Mr. Butler.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.384
But can you afford them?

37:41.425 --> 37:43.678
Meyer's a good friend
of my father-in-law's.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.846
Well, then you might
want to put a call in

37:45.888 --> 37:47.431
to the public defender.

37:47.473 --> 37:50.017
You father-in-law's the
one who turned you in.

37:57.858 --> 38:00.945
[phone ringing]

38:03.656 --> 38:05.992
Yeah.

38:08.869 --> 38:10.997
What? No, no, no,
that can't be right.

38:11.038 --> 38:12.999
You sure?

38:16.252 --> 38:18.379
Yeah, OK.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.880
All right. Thanks.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.218
That was the coroner.

38:25.886 --> 38:29.473
He said, uh, Eknath died
exactly two weeks ago.

38:31.058 --> 38:34.228
That's a few days
before Andrew was shot.

38:34.270 --> 38:37.732
So if Eknath didn't
shoot Andrew, then...

38:37.773 --> 38:41.319
Somebody else
wanted you dead.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.695
Get down!

39:30.785 --> 39:32.912
[gunshot]

39:38.334 --> 39:39.835
Siobhan...

39:39.877 --> 39:42.004
[gasping]

39:43.964 --> 39:46.384
I didn't know
what else to do.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.769
Oh, my God...

39:56.811 --> 39:58.312
You've seen him
before.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.900
Hello, Siobhan.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.777
Give me the damn phone!

40:12.618 --> 40:14.412
Mrs. Martin, who is he?

40:14.453 --> 40:16.956
I don't know.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.875
He tried to kill me
a few months ago.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.297
Kill you, not Bridget.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.927
You're going to tell me
everything you know--

40:29.969 --> 40:33.472
who's after you,
who wants you dead.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.434
[phone vibrating]

40:40.312 --> 40:42.982
Think someone's checking
to see if the job's done?

40:46.402 --> 40:47.945
Yeah.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.697
Hello.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.369
Hello?
