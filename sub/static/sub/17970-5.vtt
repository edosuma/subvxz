WEBVTT

00:08.092 --> 00:10.218
This is the suspect, Dr. Alan Farragut.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.137
Former head of the CDC's
Special Pathogens Branch...

00:13.305 --> 00:15.556
...and field leader
of the Rapid Response Team.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.267
He led his team
to the Arctic to investigate...

00:18.435 --> 00:20.687
-...a deadly pathogen that had--
-Narvik. I know.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.691
Then you know that right after
the Arctic Biosystems fiasco...

00:24.858 --> 00:28.236
...Farragut dropped out of sight.
That's the last image we have of him...

00:28.404 --> 00:31.114
...exiting the headquarters
of the Ilaria Corporation...

00:31.281 --> 00:34.117
...moments before a bomb went off.
A dozen people were killed.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.246
Farragut is wanted by the French police,
the FBI, and Europol...

00:38.414 --> 00:40.331
...but he's our responsibility.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.834
We need your help to bring him in.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.877
Why me?

00:46.130 --> 00:48.673
Your background in
toxicology and epidemiology...

00:48.882 --> 00:51.509
...makes you uniquely qualified
to join his former team.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.430
Your job is to collect intel
so we can make an arrest.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.598
Yes, ma'am.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.775
Stay with me, Sarah, okay?

01:07.985 --> 01:09.527
Stay with me.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.071
Somebody, help! Help us!

01:12.531 --> 01:13.656
Somebody, help.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.283
Someone, help.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.078
-It's okay.
-Oh, my God. What happened?

01:19.246 --> 01:21.789
-Found her on the floor.
-She's losing a lot of blood.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.374
Help me get her up.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.422
-Stop the bleeding.
-Can't feel the bottom of the wound.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.090
Shit. We need a surgeon.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.551
-What happened to her?
-Somebody attacked her.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.803
-Leave now.
-I won't leave her alone with you.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.139
She has a punctured lung,
a lacerated pancreas.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.266
Dr. Sommer and I
are medical professionals.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.143
-We'll handle this.
-Research doctors.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.438
-You're not a doctor.
-I've sutured every wound on this island...

01:45.606 --> 01:48.733
...for the past 50 years.
Unless one of you is a thoracic surgeon...

01:48.901 --> 01:50.693
...you'll just be in my way.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.242
I promise I'll take care of her.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.952
There's nothing more you can do.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.347
This place is a nuthouse.
We should grab Sarah and get out.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.349
Coast Guard can't come
for another week.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.101
Use the sat-phone.
Get an airlift back to the mainland.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.854
Kyle, we can't go anywhere
until Sarah is stable.

02:27.022 --> 02:30.483
And if we run before we get containment,
this outbreak could spread.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.277
Fine, then we should tell these people
about the honey...

02:33.445 --> 02:36.697
...before it turns the entire flock
into a bunch of raving maniacs.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.158
If we go wide with this,
it could create a panic.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.036
Are we on the same island?

02:42.955 --> 02:46.916
I just got stoned by a bunch of kids,
and someone just stabbed Sarah.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.711
We're so far past panic, it'd take the light
from panic 100 years to reach us.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.797
Okay, you're right.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.592
I'll talk to Michael.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.679
I'll tell him about the mycotoxin
in the honey.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.890
You go to the orchard,
cordon off the infected hive.

03:03.058 --> 03:06.185
We need to destroy it properly
and then bio-seal the remains.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.855
If we do our jobs,
we could still stop this thing.

04:22.638 --> 04:23.888
Honey?

04:27.142 --> 04:30.978
Are you saying that this disease,
and all the pain and suffering...

04:31.146 --> 04:33.731
...is caused by a few infected bees?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.317
More than a few.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.111
And we don't know
if the bees were the source.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.615
They could've picked up the pathogen
and carried it back to the hive.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.409
Well, how are my people getting sick?
We don't eat honey.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.119
Or any food outside of our walls.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.247
We believe one of your followers
may have harvested the honey...

04:50.415 --> 04:53.334
-...and shared it with the others.
-Who would do such a thing?

04:53.502 --> 04:55.252
There's a man.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.006
He's here undercover,
pretending to follow your rules.

04:59.216 --> 05:04.261
He's even using a false name: Jerome.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.725
Well, many of our followers come here
trying to escape their past.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.727
We offer them a fresh start.
No judgment.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.647
Does that include terrorists?
This man is a wanted criminal.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.108
Our gates are open.
We turn no one away.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.696
Did you have any of these problems
before Jerome arrived?

05:21.905 --> 05:23.698
These problems began
when you arrived.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.659
Doesn't make you a terrorist, does it?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.080
Say, I'm curious.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.582
Exactly how did you
come by this information?

05:34.334 --> 05:38.504
Jerome and I have a history.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.259
-He's my brother.
-Your brother?

05:43.969 --> 05:46.220
I wasn't expecting that.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.431
I felt I owed you an explanation.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.933
So, what do you suggest I do?

05:51.143 --> 05:53.519
Keep him away
from the rest of your people.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.771
Until you do, no one here is safe.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.027
Thank you, Peter.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.699
You've done me a great service.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.952
And now I owe you.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.314
Hello, Jerome.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.987
Michael? Where am I?

07:27.155 --> 07:29.323
Well, the French call it an oubliette.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.201
The word literally means "to forget."

07:32.369 --> 07:34.495
You want to forget me?

07:34.663 --> 07:39.083
Why? Have I done
something to displease you?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.628
It's time for you
to confront your past, Jerome.

07:42.838 --> 07:43.963
Your true past.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.841
And for you to be honest about
who you are...

07:47.425 --> 07:49.135
...and what you've done.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.512
But my past is my own.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.556
You told us to leave it at the gate.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.725
Don't tell it to me.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.229
Talk to him.

08:16.663 --> 08:20.457
Dr. Farragut seems to think
you're dangerous.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.962
He actually knows quite a bit
about you. Well, he should...

08:25.130 --> 08:26.672
...since he's your brother.

08:28.341 --> 08:33.679
I really have no idea
why he wanted me to confine you.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.725
But, I mean, it's fairly obvious that
you two have your issues.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.727
Maybe you'll solve them.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.355
Maybe you'll kill each other.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.191
I can't wait to find out which.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.829
-You gonna untie me?
-Depends.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.831
Wanna tell me
why he threw you in here?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.375
I was trying to do my job.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.753
To protect his people
from the mycosis.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.339
And that involved ratting me out?

09:09.174 --> 09:12.718
Look, I was trying to convince him
to work with us.

09:12.928 --> 09:15.262
-You were my last chip to bargain with.
-Right.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.307
Michael and his people
have been working against my team.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.019
My team.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.314
Not anymore.

09:26.816 --> 09:31.779
You know, every time something
goes wrong, I look up and there you are.

09:31.988 --> 09:36.283
-Arctic Biosystems, Paris, and now here.
-Me?

09:37.661 --> 09:41.330
You blew up a building, Alan.
You murdered people.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.790
I was trying to save Julia.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.169
-Well, you could've killed her.
-Since when do you care?

09:47.379 --> 09:51.006
Oh, that's right,
since you slept with her.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.467
You selfish, self-centered prick.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.637
I went up to the Arctic
to get away from her.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.307
So you could have your life back.
And what did I get?

10:00.517 --> 10:03.060
Narvik. I nearly lost everything.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.437
And yet somehow
you're the one who suffered?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.899
I lost Julia in the Arctic.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.611
Don't kid yourself. She'd been trying
to get away from you for years.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.239
Not another word about her.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.325
Oh, it's easy to threaten a man
when he's tied up.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.755
-Now say something.
-You threw your life away, Alan.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.718
-You're a murderer and a terrorist.
-And you're a second-rate hack...

10:35.885 --> 10:40.055
...who's pretending to live my life
because he couldn't make it on his own.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.934
Do you have any idea what it's like...

10:44.144 --> 10:46.603
...to be the man who
could never quite measure up?

10:46.771 --> 10:49.398
Not my fault I was better at everything.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.984
That's not what your wife said.

11:05.957 --> 11:09.001
I would very much like to know.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.880
What is going on in my orchard?

11:13.465 --> 11:15.090
Is something happening?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.386
Well, our friends in the CDC
seem to have figured out...

11:19.554 --> 11:22.765
...how this terrible sickness
is transmitted.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.768
Through honey.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.231
Michael, that's not possible.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.234
We followed the safeguards,
took every precaution.

11:34.444 --> 11:39.531
And yet there is a contaminated
beehive where no hive should be.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.577
If that's following precautions,
I'd hate to see out-of-control.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.704
We bred the pollen to be aseptic.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.624
Even if bees were cross-pollinating
from outside the wall...

11:48.833 --> 11:51.835
-...this shouldn't be happening.
-Then how can you explain it?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.714
Sometimes nature finds a way.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.052
Nature.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.604
Do you know what this is?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.606
Cerbera odollam.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.025
It's from Madagascar.

12:15.193 --> 12:18.570
They call it the suicide tree.

12:18.780 --> 12:24.827
Its sap contains an alkaloid toxin which
blocks the calcium channels in the heart.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.913
Just a single drop,
the heart stops completely.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.292
And death is nearly instantaneous.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.264
If nature had its way,
you'd already be dead.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.854
But this plant is harmless
because I grafted the poison out of it.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.235
On this island, nature does
what I tell it to do.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.112
Just like you.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.739
Fix this.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.800
Being dead can't possibly
hurt this much.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.137
-Stay still.
-Something's not right.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.931
You're not gonna die on me, are you?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.641
I didn't think that was possible.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.310
I'm already dying.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.898
I know. You told me.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.234
TXM-7. But I thought you were--

13:39.444 --> 13:41.904
Immortal, not indestructible.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.448
I don't age.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.241
I heal faster than you.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.660
But I can't grow a finger.
I'm not Wolverine.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.914
Who's Wolverine?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.211
Still.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.631
It hurts to laugh.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.012
Still.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.557
You fought the haunted man?

14:10.725 --> 14:12.726
The one that talks to ghosts?

14:12.894 --> 14:14.228
His name was Hatake.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.606
"Was"? Is he dead?

14:18.525 --> 14:19.942
I don't know.

14:20.652 --> 14:24.738
Why did you fight?
Is it about why you're here?

14:24.906 --> 14:28.158
No, our fight was personal.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.620
He was my father.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.458
You killed your father?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.212
We had issues.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.300
I have issues with my father too.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.596
Different kind.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.390
I never met him.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.434
Yeah, well, maybe that's for the best.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.104
God.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.030
Kyle?

15:07.949 --> 15:08.991
Kyle.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.286
You're awake.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.164
Where is everybody?

15:18.876 --> 15:22.629
They were very concerned about you,
especially Dr. Sommer.

15:24.882 --> 15:28.427
-How do you feel?
-Like someone just stabbed me.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.096
You barely had a pulse.

15:31.306 --> 15:35.058
I've never seen someone recover
so quickly after losing so much blood.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.477
Yeah, I've always been a fast healer.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.524
You have a perforation
in your lung and pancreas.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.192
Lie back.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.819
Okay.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.118
Was there any permanent damage?

15:53.286 --> 15:54.995
You'll have a pretty good scar.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.998
But your recovery is remarkable.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.462
-Good genes, I guess.
-Clearly.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.758
Did you know about the honey?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.762
I just found out from Michael.
I was coming to tell you.

16:14.807 --> 16:20.604
The way this works is when you
hear things, you tell me immediately.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.189
So I don't get blindsided.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.527
If I have to find things out on my own,
what do I need you for?

16:27.695 --> 16:29.988
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

16:31.074 --> 16:34.534
That's not the only thing
that won't be happening again.

17:07.235 --> 17:08.902
Oh, shit.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.329
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

17:19.497 --> 17:21.498
Jesus.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.500
Doesn't make sense.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.669
Your symptoms are still presenting.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.170
You shouldn't be dead yet.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.256
I'm not. I'm just the bait.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.770
Outsiders, die!

17:46.816 --> 17:49.359
You shouldn't be here.
You're not welcome.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.065
Come.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.864
Michael, I wanted to apologize.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.451
I should have checked the grounds
for any rogue hives.

19:22.411 --> 19:27.541
I believed the pollen was sterile,
but obviously I was wrong.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.630
I understand.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.467
And I forgive you.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.642
I know how difficult it is for you to see
the scope of what we're doing here.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.020
But that's why I need the three of you.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.731
We cannot allow things
to fall through the cracks.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.984
I know. It won't happen again.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.250
Oh, Anne.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.671
So strong.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.090
And smart.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.260
Clear-headed.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.595
A good leader.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.267
It's a shame
what the years have done to you.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.437
I suppose it can't be helped.

20:32.023 --> 20:36.067
Perhaps one day we'll be able
to hold back the ravages of time...

20:37.695 --> 20:39.613
...but until then....

20:43.367 --> 20:44.993
Until then.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.293
I think you knocked a filling loose.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.671
-Serves you right.
-Same one you knocked out in school.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.507
-You deserved it that time too.
-That wasn't a fair fight.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.427
-I was hungover.
-Is that your excuse for losing?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.930
You always did have a great left hook.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.390
Just like the old man.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.809
I'm nothing like Dad.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.188
Sorry.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.568
Used to be you and me
against that bastard.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.655
Now look at us.
I don't know what happened.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.908
We grew up.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.163
You think we'll ever figure this out?

21:31.207 --> 21:32.707
What's to figure?

21:33.334 --> 21:37.045
Michael threw us down here so we could
beat the hell out of each other.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.841
No.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.345
No, I think he put us down here...

21:45.513 --> 21:47.263
...to see if we'd figure a way out.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.893
-It's a fricking dungeon, Alan.
-Look.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.772
If I put you on my shoulders,
you can reach that grate.

21:55.940 --> 22:00.360
Who knows if it's locked?
If not, you can pull me up after.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.406
Yeah, you're right.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.659
Okay, hoist me up and....

22:09.537 --> 22:11.121
What?

22:12.707 --> 22:13.707
Come on.

22:16.043 --> 22:19.337
-I get it. You don't trust me.
-You did just try to knock out my teeth.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.464
That means I'm gonna leave you
down here?

22:21.632 --> 22:24.259
Look, no matter what
our differences are, we're family.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.928
-I would never do that to you.
-I wanna believe you.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.014
But with all we've been
through lately....

22:30.099 --> 22:33.727
Okay, I'll boost you,
and then you pull me up after, okay?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.270
You'd do that?

22:35.438 --> 22:39.274
Yeah. Like I said, we're family.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.821
Come on.

22:52.621 --> 22:56.916
No signs of infection or sepsis.
Your swelling is already going down.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.045
Great. That means
I'll be out of here soon.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.505
You shouldn't be so eager.

23:03.174 --> 23:06.134
That recklessness is what got you
in trouble in the first place.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.346
See, in the real world,
there's this new thing...

23:10.514 --> 23:12.557
...where we don't actually
blame the victims.

23:13.517 --> 23:17.645
A woman in your condition shouldn't be
going anywhere near infectious diseases.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.731
What do you mean, my condition?

23:20.524 --> 23:23.276
You need to take better care
of yourself.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.736
And your baby.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.240
No. No, I'm not pregnant.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.493
I've delivered nearly
a hundred little ones.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.953
I think I know
when a woman is with child.

23:37.958 --> 23:41.419
Is it okay if this just stays between us?

23:42.004 --> 23:44.756
Of course.
You haven't told the father yet?

23:45.591 --> 23:46.800
Is it Dr. Sommer?

23:47.885 --> 23:49.302
Kyle?

23:49.470 --> 23:53.223
-No. No.
-He seems to care a great deal for you.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.059
Kyle and I are just colleagues.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.853
As for the father, he....

24:04.318 --> 24:06.945
He and I aren't close anymore.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.531
Perhaps it's just as well.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.492
-The better to protect your legacy.
-My legacy?

24:12.660 --> 24:15.537
Children are the only thing that last.
Nothing else matters.

24:15.704 --> 24:20.375
I've cared for hundreds of people
on this island, saved many lives.

24:21.961 --> 24:27.257
But when I'm gone, I'll be nothing more
than a picture on a wall.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.594
But through our children,
we live forever.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.222
Trust me...

24:35.724 --> 24:38.226
...there's more to life than living forever.

24:51.282 --> 24:54.826
What is that stuff? Smells like
my grandma's condo in Saint Pete.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.286
Lavender oil.

24:56.453 --> 25:00.540
It's a natural antidote for bruising.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.417
I'm sure I'll be fine.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.796
This island can be dangerous.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.633
You think this is a game?
There were six members of that crew.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.218
We've only found four.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.221
That means there's two homicidal
Mycotics loose on the island.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.932
Maybe more if anyone else
ate more of that honey.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.689
This pathogen is spreading.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.859
And you're acting like a naughty
schoolgirl with her first crush.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.486
I didn't know you like to play rough.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.822
I can play rough too.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.355
Where'd you learn to cook?

26:06.440 --> 26:08.441
My mother.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.195
She said a good meal
nourishes the soul.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.239
Smart woman.

26:14.615 --> 26:17.867
-She had to be.
-Did you ever try to find your father?

26:25.251 --> 26:27.377
There's nothing to find.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.963
He died in the Narvik outbreak
when I was young.

26:30.130 --> 26:34.759
I remember.
That was nearly 30 years ago.

26:36.637 --> 26:40.723
That's why my mother brought me here.
The riots, the outbreaks.

26:40.891 --> 26:45.186
She said that the world was no longer
a fit place to raise a child.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.023
Like I said, smart woman.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.817
And it's only gotten worse.

26:51.527 --> 26:52.986
Maybe you'll find a cure.

26:54.697 --> 26:59.492
Not at this rate. By the time I get back,
there may not be much of a world left.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.494
I hear there's not much left anyway.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.498
I wouldn't have risked my life
for nothing.

27:05.666 --> 27:09.627
I'm trying to save all the remaining
immortals before it's too late.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.632
Funny.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.592
What's that?

27:17.553 --> 27:20.680
All it took was a little mortality
to make you people human again.

27:43.412 --> 27:47.790
You should be sleeping,
but you're awake, alert.

27:52.046 --> 27:54.339
I've been in bed all day.
I need to move around.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.633
-Slow down. You're not ready yet.
-I'll be fine.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.137
I really need to get back to the lab
and check on my team.

28:02.806 --> 28:06.601
At least let me get you cleaned up.
You've still got blood on your face.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.532
Just another moment.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.598
No.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.061
It can't be.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.496
Landry.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.124
To what do I owe the pleasure?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.876
Amy thought you might need this.

29:21.009 --> 29:24.262
Right. She probably just
wanted you to check up on me.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.597
-What does that mean?
-Make sure I wasn't--

29:26.765 --> 29:27.974
Wasn't what?

29:35.649 --> 29:38.818
Making any mistakes with my work.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.363
She's been very concerned
about our progress.

29:43.407 --> 29:47.910
Amy is the best thing
that ever happened to this island.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.955
She's a-- She's a special girl.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.292
And lucky to have somebody like you
looking after her.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.255
If you don't mind,
I need to get back to my work.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.114
Agnes. Agnes, where have you been?

30:25.282 --> 30:28.201
-We need your help.
-I've been taking care of my patient.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.911
We have a problem.

30:30.078 --> 30:33.956
The sickness, it's in the bees.
Their honey is infected.

30:34.124 --> 30:38.044
-We have to do something.
-Find Anne. Deal with it.

30:38.212 --> 30:39.712
Did you hear what I said?

30:39.880 --> 30:41.839
We have bigger concerns
than a few bees.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.676
The CDC doctor is a silver-eye.

30:46.386 --> 30:50.097
-No, that's not possible.
-You're right, Amy.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.183
It's not.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.775
Okay.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.277
Bring me forward.

31:09.743 --> 31:10.743
Come on, hurry up.

31:10.911 --> 31:14.163
The human spine's not designed
to carry this much weight at its apex.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.375
Hold on a sec. All right.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.379
Come on.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.183
I got it.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.894
Let me get wedged in here.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.953
Come on.

31:55.581 --> 31:56.831
God.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.726
You know the only reason
I'm in this mess...

32:16.893 --> 32:18.811
...is I tried to save you in the Arctic?

32:19.313 --> 32:20.730
What--?

32:20.897 --> 32:24.275
What are you talking about?
Just get me out of this hole.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.820
Spent most of my life
trying to save you from yourself.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.864
But it is way too late.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.825
Alan, we had a deal.

32:33.744 --> 32:36.287
I boost you up,
you'd have never come back for me.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.957
No, no, no. Come on. That's not true.
I'd never do that to you.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.543
-You're my brother.
-You're no brother.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.880
The shortcuts,
the backroom deals, the lies.

32:46.048 --> 32:48.758
-You know who that sounds like?
-You bastard.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.344
-Our father.
-Come on, just get me out of this hole.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.429
You ready to tell the truth?

32:53.597 --> 32:56.390
-About what?
-Narvik in Puerto Rico?

32:56.558 --> 32:59.894
That adolescent psychopath
the Scythe escaping in the Arctic?

33:00.062 --> 33:02.605
The mistakes in Paris?

33:03.440 --> 33:06.108
How long have you been
working for Ilaria?

33:08.236 --> 33:09.737
What?

33:10.614 --> 33:12.031
That's ridiculous.

33:12.199 --> 33:16.285
I heard you, Peter.
You called them from the roof.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.371
You always took the easy way out.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.582
Never wanted to work for anything.
What did they offer you? Money?

33:21.750 --> 33:24.043
A seat on the board?

33:24.670 --> 33:26.170
Jesus.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.631
You didn't get that much
from them, did you?

33:28.799 --> 33:32.677
You sold your soul,
you disloyal son of a bitch.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.637
And for nothing.

33:34.805 --> 33:38.974
Hey, hey, you don't know
what you're talking about, okay?

33:40.435 --> 33:42.895
Just get me out of this hole.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.065
You dug this hole yourself.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.359
It's where you belong.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.487
Alan! Alan!

33:51.655 --> 33:54.782
Alan, don't leave me here! Alan!

34:09.172 --> 34:11.298
I just wanted
to check your temperature.

34:12.968 --> 34:15.010
-Am I okay?
-You're fine.

34:16.430 --> 34:17.805
Better than that.

34:17.973 --> 34:22.643
You almost look as healthy as you did
when you landed.

34:23.979 --> 34:25.688
You mean, right before
you clubbed me?

34:26.857 --> 34:29.608
I already apologized for that.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.402
No, you didn't.

34:33.613 --> 34:34.864
But I forgive you.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.534
What about your father?

34:42.164 --> 34:44.123
Did you think about forgiving him?

34:44.791 --> 34:46.459
That wasn't really an option.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.297
But I think in the end,
this sword was some sort of apology.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.509
He called it his legacy.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.013
May I?

35:20.535 --> 35:21.827
Do you know what it says?

35:24.790 --> 35:27.917
My father never taught me
how to read Japanese.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.922
His last gift,
I have no idea what it means.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.097
You get some sleep.

35:46.269 --> 35:49.897
Here's the last of the honey,
just like you asked.

35:50.482 --> 35:54.652
-I gave the rest to your CDC friend.
-He's not my friend.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.280
You are.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.491
And you did a very good job.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.368
This jar...

36:09.209 --> 36:12.586
...is going to get me off this island.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.463
And you, Landry?

36:19.594 --> 36:21.262
You got it for me.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.083
Caleb?

36:55.839 --> 36:57.965
Oh, no. No.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.593
No, no, no.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.184
Caleb!

37:12.063 --> 37:14.064
Caleb!

37:36.963 --> 37:38.464
Damn it.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.133
You don't look very comfortable
with that equipment.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.677
Long day. You need something?

37:43.845 --> 37:47.014
I'm looking for Dr. Jordan.
Have you seen her?

37:47.599 --> 37:50.643
-She's taking samples.
-This late at night?

37:50.810 --> 37:53.938
You know Hot Zone.
All business, all the time.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.815
She doesn't really have
an off switch, does she?

37:56.983 --> 38:00.194
Yeah. If you see her before I do,
tell her I need to talk to her.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.362
It's important.

38:02.155 --> 38:04.949
-Wait, you can't go.
-Excuse me?

38:05.116 --> 38:08.953
-Well, Dr. Jordan said you might help us.
-Not before I talk to her.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.829
Well, then settle something for me.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.915
-Arctic Biosystems.
-What?

38:13.541 --> 38:17.252
-There are rumors.
-Well, she was there, so you can ask her.

38:17.963 --> 38:18.963
What about Paris?

38:20.173 --> 38:22.049
Was she there too?

38:23.677 --> 38:26.053
I figure I ought to know
who I'm working with.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.931
Did Sarah help you
blow up that building?

38:29.975 --> 38:31.976
Who are you?

38:32.143 --> 38:35.270
-What are you really doing here?
-Hey, I'm investigating a pathogen.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.064
How about you?

38:39.401 --> 38:41.360
Who do you work for? Tell me.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.696
-You work for Ilaria, don't you?
-I don't.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.031
Tell me. Who do you work for?

38:55.166 --> 38:58.460
You're making a huge mistake,
Dr. Sommer.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.765
I don't know how we reached this point.

39:11.933 --> 39:17.312
Illness, disobedience,
contempt for our rules.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.774
I'm failing my people.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.569
There's some good news.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.738
The CDC doctor's recovering.

39:26.573 --> 39:28.949
You said she was going to make it.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.452
She shouldn't have.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.455
I'd say it's a miracle,
if I believed in that sort of thing...

39:34.622 --> 39:36.415
...but you and I both know better.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.542
Do we?

39:39.127 --> 39:41.754
She's not the first person I've seen
who heals like that.

39:43.757 --> 39:45.591
I'd say she's just like you.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.844
There's no one like me.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.771
You lied to us.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.649
No, Agnes, of course I didn't.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.446
You told us you were the only one.

40:08.323 --> 40:10.240
That there were no others.

40:13.078 --> 40:17.664
But I saw her eyes. Silver, like yours.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.420
That's impossible. She wasn't there.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.050
Wasn't where?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.762
You've always known
there were others, haven't you?

40:31.930 --> 40:35.015
-Oh, Agnes.
-Please, tell me the truth.

40:35.642 --> 40:37.017
Are there other immortals?

40:40.021 --> 40:42.648
Have you been keeping this from us?

40:44.359 --> 40:48.028
-Could you have made me like you?
-Agnes.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.781
Agnes.

40:51.658 --> 40:55.077
You know I love you.

40:55.245 --> 40:57.704
More than every face on that wall.

40:58.206 --> 41:03.502
Ever since you were, oh, a small child,
you were different.

41:03.670 --> 41:09.133
You were smarter.
You were more self-possessed.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.510
More driven.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.013
Of all my daughters...

41:15.181 --> 41:17.808
...you've always been my favorite.

41:20.019 --> 41:25.524
But this lack of trust, this doubt,
it's like a virus.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.901
And we will lose everything
we've worked for...

41:28.069 --> 41:31.864
...everything I've built
for the past 500 years.

41:34.409 --> 41:38.453
-I just wanna be with you forever.
-Oh, I know.
