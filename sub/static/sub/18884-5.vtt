08:19.896 --> 08:21.137
- Yeah! Yeah!

08:21.137 --> 08:23.620
- [screaming]

08:23.620 --> 08:24.896
Oh! Oh!

08:24.896 --> 08:26.586
- Blake--no--ah! Hey!

08:26.586 --> 08:29.448
Ow! Sir! Ow! Ow!

08:29.448 --> 08:31.137
Ow, wait--

08:31.137 --> 08:32.827
[cheers and applause]
- Oh! Standing ovation!

08:32.827 --> 08:34.827
- I just--wanted to--

08:34.827 --> 08:36.310
I didn'’t like that.

08:36.310 --> 08:38.482
- And now that is entertainment!
Isn'’t it?

08:38.482 --> 08:41.482
- I didn'’t like that.
- Uncle Mike! What is up?

08:41.482 --> 08:44.517
What'’s it been, like, ten? 15?
Like, 25 years?

08:44.517 --> 08:47.034
I don'’t know, you'’re not
in my life at all, really.

08:47.034 --> 08:49.689
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

08:49.689 --> 08:52.275
You gotta call someone else
to handle your shit?

08:52.275 --> 08:54.344
- Uh, okay, come on,
just Hender hug, man.

08:54.344 --> 08:56.827
Whoa! Okay!
- Is that a man thong?

08:56.827 --> 08:59.137
- What? No, it'’s a dance belt!
That'’s a dan--

08:59.137 --> 09:00.344
[smacking]
Ow! What are you doing?

09:00.344 --> 09:03.000
What are you doing?
Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:03.000 --> 09:05.241
Ah, ah--for my--
- Now get out of here.

09:05.241 --> 09:07.172
And don'’t come back
till you knock me on my ass.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.000
- Oh, I think he
popped a butt cheek.

09:10.137 --> 09:12.137
- Insurance.
- It hurts even to

09:12.137 --> 09:14.758
get the wallet out, doesn'’t it?

09:14.758 --> 09:17.862
- Well there we go.
- Our bottoms were paddled

09:17.862 --> 09:19.310
by this man'’s...
- Shut up.

09:19.310 --> 09:20.724
- Idiot uncle.
- Yeah.

09:20.724 --> 09:22.172
- And, uh, they'’re sore.
- Smarter than you.

09:22.172 --> 09:23.517
- They hurt. We think
we ruptured something.

09:23.517 --> 09:25.000
- Yeah, no, it'’s really severe.
- It is.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.517
It is pretty bad.
- Yep.

09:28.517 --> 09:30.206
Ahh, ahh.
- Was it bad?

09:30.206 --> 09:31.896
- And my thong is just--
oh, my dance belt'’s

09:31.896 --> 09:33.068
getting swallowed up
by my cheeks.

09:33.068 --> 09:35.344
- Pull your damn pants up!
- Sorry.

09:35.344 --> 09:36.482
- Ahh.
- You'’re not the doctor?

09:36.482 --> 09:37.965
- You see, I'’m very worried

09:37.965 --> 09:40.172
that my inner butthole
may be dead

09:40.172 --> 09:42.517
because the--what'’s the--
is it the sphincter?

09:42.517 --> 09:43.965
- Yeah.
- It'’s the mouth.

09:43.965 --> 09:45.413
- Not really--
- The butt mouth.

09:45.413 --> 09:46.724
- Yeah, the butt mouth
isn'’t really puckering

09:46.724 --> 09:48.068
the way it should.

09:48.068 --> 09:50.137
- Okay, let'’s get you a room.

09:50.137 --> 09:51.724
- Ah, sorry.
- Man I'’ve been

09:51.724 --> 09:53.275
waiting her for six hours!

09:53.275 --> 09:56.862
- Well they have insurance.
You don'’t.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.827
What you want me to say?

09:59.827 --> 10:01.758
- Does that guy have a sandwich
baggie full of his fingers?

10:01.758 --> 10:02.931
[door buzzer sounds]

10:02.931 --> 10:04.275
- He'’ll be all right.

10:04.275 --> 10:05.896
- Well I hope you'’re happy,
Blake.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.551
We'’re probably gonna miss
the festival girls, so...

10:08.551 --> 10:13.344
see you later, sideboob.
- See you later, underboob.

10:13.344 --> 10:15.206
- See you later, under butt.

10:15.206 --> 10:18.551
- I just wanted to dance,
damn it.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.724
- Would you do me a favor
and go fuck yourself?

10:21.724 --> 10:24.241
- God damn it!
Why are you such a bully?

10:24.241 --> 10:25.862
Both of you!
- Give it a rest!

10:25.862 --> 10:27.482
- You bullied us
into bullying you.

10:27.482 --> 10:29.379
- Oh, did I?
Why don'’t you bully this?

10:29.379 --> 10:30.862
- Hey!
- Ow! That'’s a--

10:30.862 --> 10:32.862
- Ow.
Don'’t you do it! Ow!

10:32.862 --> 10:34.241
- Oh you got me
right in the buttocks.

10:34.241 --> 10:36.310
[yelling over each other]

10:36.310 --> 10:38.862
- You want--
- [screams]

10:38.862 --> 10:39.793
- Hold him down!
Hold him down!

10:39.793 --> 10:41.482
[screaming]

10:41.482 --> 10:43.103
Ohh!

10:43.103 --> 10:44.896
Oh, oh.
- Now he'’s a blood mess.

10:44.896 --> 10:47.655
- Dance kick!
both: Oh!

10:47.655 --> 10:49.413
- [screams]

10:49.413 --> 10:51.068
- Help!
- You stop it!

10:51.068 --> 10:52.413
Why don'’t you stop it?
- Help!

10:52.413 --> 10:54.137
- Get your balls off me.
- Sorry about that.

10:54.137 --> 10:55.896
- [chuckles] I, uh--
- What'’s going on, man?

10:55.896 --> 10:58.172
Do you need some medicine or,
like, a surgery or something?

10:58.172 --> 10:59.827
- If you guys
are done grab assing,

10:59.827 --> 11:02.655
you can grab my ass
and take me to the toilet.

11:02.655 --> 11:04.586
[all laughing]
- Yeah, yeah, we'’re gonna

11:04.586 --> 11:06.068
help him to the toilet--
- That'’s funny.

11:06.068 --> 11:07.448
- Wait are you serious?
- There you go.

11:07.448 --> 11:08.758
- Oh, give him a--
- Oh.

11:08.758 --> 11:10.827
- Yeah. Oh, wait a second.

11:10.827 --> 11:13.724
- Uh, are you sure
you don'’t want some privacy?

11:13.724 --> 11:16.241
- When I overheard
you boys fighting,

11:16.241 --> 11:19.620
uh, it reminded me
of my best friend, Luke.

11:19.620 --> 11:21.413
He spent his whole life
wanting to be

11:21.413 --> 11:23.655
the host of a cooking show

11:23.655 --> 11:27.241
and I told him Julia Child
you ain'’t.

11:27.241 --> 11:30.896
Which threw him into
a "Tailspin" audition.

11:30.896 --> 11:33.689
He had done a ton of these
cartoon voice-over jobs

11:33.689 --> 11:36.379
and he hated it.

11:36.379 --> 11:40.000
Anyway, he blew his brains out.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.517
- Hey, sir, are you sure
that your friend

11:42.517 --> 11:43.896
specifically killed himself
because you didn'’t

11:43.896 --> 11:46.137
encourage him to pursue
his dreams? That'’s--

11:46.137 --> 11:49.206
- Uh, yes.
In fact, he wrote a long letter,

11:49.206 --> 11:51.724
telling me it was all my fault.

11:51.724 --> 11:53.275
- Oh, my God.
- I carry it with me

11:53.275 --> 11:54.827
wherever I go.

11:54.827 --> 11:58.413
- Okay, shut up real quick
because I have an idea.

11:58.413 --> 12:01.413
What if Blake
blows his brains out

12:01.413 --> 12:03.310
just because he didn'’t do
what he loves?

12:03.310 --> 12:04.793
- Well--
- Because we made fun of him

12:04.793 --> 12:06.827
so much.
- Oh, my God.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.310
- That'’s why I told you--
- Shut up, real quick.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.413
Life'’s too short
to not do what you love.

12:11.413 --> 12:12.862
Fortunately for me,
I'’ve kind of already

12:12.862 --> 12:14.655
done everything I wanted
to do with my life.

12:14.655 --> 12:17.620
- Yeah, I mean, same here.
I mean, I'’ve had anal.

12:17.620 --> 12:20.275
- What?
- I'’ve done--I'’ve done anal

12:20.275 --> 12:21.862
to someone.
- That'’s not what

12:21.862 --> 12:23.275
you said, though.
- Look, what I'’m trying to say

12:23.275 --> 12:26.275
is Blake, I am sorry
for not letting you do

12:26.275 --> 12:28.517
what you wanna do,
which was dancing.

12:28.517 --> 12:31.000
And for me, which, that would be
the anal that I had

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
when that occurred.
- Right, right.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.827
- Okay, shut up.
Shut up.

12:33.827 --> 12:35.206
Just real quick.

12:35.206 --> 12:37.965
Blake, when we go back
to Faux Chella,

12:37.965 --> 12:40.413
you gotta dance, my man.

12:40.413 --> 12:42.034
Or something cooler than that.

12:42.034 --> 12:44.275
- Yeah. Anything.
- Anything cooler than that.

12:44.275 --> 12:45.724
- Shut up.
- Okay.

12:45.724 --> 12:46.724
- Shut up.
- Okay.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.068
- Okay, shutting up.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.482
- Because that apology
feels so good.

12:49.482 --> 12:50.793
It'’s like
a warm blanket over me.

12:50.793 --> 12:52.206
- [farting]
- And I wanna go home

12:52.206 --> 12:53.827
and I wanna save
this music festival

12:53.827 --> 12:58.241
that we threw for three,
lucky, random ladies

12:58.241 --> 13:00.310
that we met for, like,
ten minutes

13:00.310 --> 13:02.206
at the bar the other day.
- If that.

13:02.206 --> 13:04.724
- Let'’s do this for them!
- Wait a minute, wait, wait!

13:04.724 --> 13:06.689
There'’s no toilet paper.
all: Shut up!

13:06.689 --> 13:09.620
- Wait--

13:09.620 --> 13:12.206
[laughs]

13:12.206 --> 13:13.344
Thank you, Luke.

13:13.344 --> 13:14.586
- Yo, what up, Faux Chella,

13:14.586 --> 13:16.551
we are Fade Up Fade Out Bye Bye.

13:16.551 --> 13:19.551

15:08.931 --> 15:10.724
- Yeah.
- '’Cause you'’re old.

15:10.724 --> 15:12.172

We got full butt.
Whoa! Full butt.

[whistling]
- Oh, wow.

15:36.448 --> 15:38.000
[laughter]

15:38.000 --> 15:41.137
- So, uh,
where'’s, uh, Shannon?

15:41.137 --> 15:42.655
- Uh, it'’s Hannon.

15:42.655 --> 15:44.172
It'’s Hannon, right?
Is she parking?

15:44.172 --> 15:45.517
- Oh, yeah, no.

15:45.517 --> 15:48.379
But my mom and stepdad,
super excited

15:48.379 --> 15:49.827
to see Third Eye Blind,
though.

15:49.827 --> 15:52.103
- "Jumper" was the song
we got married to.

15:52.103 --> 15:54.620
Tom was going through
some stuff.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.482
- There were several
suicide attempts.

15:56.482 --> 15:58.793
But Tina and Megan
pulled me through.

15:58.793 --> 16:00.517
- That'’s why
she likes Third Eye.

16:00.517 --> 16:02.448
- So what time do they go on?

16:02.448 --> 16:03.758
Third Eye Blind?
- Well, we don'’t

16:03.758 --> 16:06.586
know that exactly,
but they just posted

16:06.586 --> 16:08.413
this Instagram picture of them

16:08.413 --> 16:10.310
kicking it poolside.

16:10.310 --> 16:11.793
- That looks like a--

16:11.793 --> 16:13.068
it looks like
a kid'’s birthday party.

16:13.068 --> 16:14.793
- Yeah, well.
- I guess there are

16:14.793 --> 16:16.137
some children there.
- That'’s cool, though.

16:16.137 --> 16:18.172
You know, family time
for busy musicians.

16:18.172 --> 16:19.758
They need it, too, you know?

16:19.758 --> 16:22.586
- And I'’ve been emailing
their manager Mailer Daemon.

16:22.586 --> 16:23.896
Mailer-daemon?
- Mm-hmm.

16:23.896 --> 16:25.655
- Well that is not his name.

16:25.655 --> 16:27.275
It'’s Mailer Daemon.

16:27.275 --> 16:28.724
- Mailer-daemon.
It means that

16:28.724 --> 16:30.379
your email didn'’t go through.

16:30.379 --> 16:31.551
Dumb ass!

16:31.551 --> 16:32.551
- Guys, I really need
to hear them.

16:32.551 --> 16:33.931
- Give us a couple seconds

16:33.931 --> 16:35.758
and we'’re gonna go talk,
send some emails

16:35.758 --> 16:37.379
and, uh, be right back!
- Everything'’s fine.

16:37.379 --> 16:38.379
Everything'’s fine.

16:38.379 --> 16:39.586
- Guys, I hate to admit it,

16:39.586 --> 16:41.000
but I think I was blind
to the fact

16:41.000 --> 16:42.551
that Third Eye Blind'’s
not coming.

16:42.551 --> 16:43.827
- You heard what he said.
All we gotta do

16:43.827 --> 16:45.103
is just "Drunk History"
this thing.

16:45.103 --> 16:46.551
- Oh, I love that show!

16:46.551 --> 16:47.965
- Oh, man! Come on!
- What is that?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.551
What'’s going on?
- Huh?

16:49.551 --> 16:50.586
- Oh, my God,
you'’re such a dickhead!

16:50.586 --> 16:52.862
- Break '’em, now!

16:52.862 --> 16:54.034
- No!

16:54.034 --> 16:56.413
- Hey!
- Look who decided to come back.

16:56.413 --> 16:59.000
- You ready for me to knock you
on your ass, Uncle Mike?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.827
- Yes!
- Yeah! Get him, Beezer!

17:00.827 --> 17:01.965
- Whoo!
- He'’s not actually

17:01.965 --> 17:03.517
gonna do it, right?
- No.

17:03.517 --> 17:04.689
- It'’s gonna be like a dumb
metaphorical thing?

17:04.689 --> 17:06.103
- Yeah.
- Got it.

17:06.103 --> 17:07.517
- Okay Raggedy Andy.
Let'’s see what you got.

17:07.517 --> 17:09.275
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, no.

17:09.275 --> 17:11.827
No. That'’s not how
I'’m knocking you on your ass.

17:11.827 --> 17:14.000
- Called it.
- Okay. Shut up.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.586
All right, I'’m gonna
knock you on your ass.

17:16.586 --> 17:18.241
In the sense of the saying.

17:18.241 --> 17:20.448
It'’s a play on words.
- Yeah, knock him on his ass

17:20.448 --> 17:21.896
how the saying goes!
- Thank you!

17:21.896 --> 17:24.137
Now there'’s a friend.
- Is that a saying?

17:24.137 --> 17:26.517
- Not where I grew up.
- Not where I grew up, either.

17:26.517 --> 17:28.310
- Where'’d you grow up?
- Omaha.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.896
- Okay, uh, everybody, we'’re
about to do something very cool.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.724
But first, I just wanted
to say one thing

17:32.724 --> 17:35.655
to Megan'’s stepdad.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.793
You came here because you said

17:36.793 --> 17:39.448
you wanted to hear
Third Eye Blind.

17:39.448 --> 17:44.793
Well, hear you go.

17:44.793 --> 17:47.034

19:33.000 --> 19:34.793
- Oh, my God.
Uncle Mike are you okay?

19:34.793 --> 19:37.379
- I get micromanaged at work.

19:37.379 --> 19:40.172
I can'’t figure out
the stupid computer system.

19:40.172 --> 19:43.034
I get no respect.
- That sucks. Where do you work?

19:43.034 --> 19:46.000
- Hertz.
- You work at Hertz Rent A Car?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.862
- No, I said, "It hurts."

19:48.862 --> 19:51.137
I work at Budget.
The other day I promised

19:51.137 --> 19:54.103
the same Chevy Cruze
to five different people.

19:54.103 --> 19:56.206
Janet yelled at me
in front of everyone.

19:56.206 --> 19:58.000
- Fuck Janet.
- Would you forgive me?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.241
- Of course. But, hey,

20:00.241 --> 20:02.827
you have to admit,
I knocked you on your ass.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.620
- Yeah, emotionally,
you knocked me on my ass.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.172
- Right.
- Hell yeah.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.103
- [laughs]

20:09.103 --> 20:11.379
Oh! Okay!
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

20:11.379 --> 20:13.310
- Not really. He didn'’t really
knock him on his ass.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.965
- Felt good. [laughs]
- Kinda. Emotionally, he did.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.862
- Hey, thanks for
having my back, guys.

20:17.862 --> 20:20.034
- We just did
what you said to do

20:20.034 --> 20:21.379
But this time in a nice way.
You know?

20:21.379 --> 20:24.862
- Uh, can I get a ride
back to the hospital?

20:24.862 --> 20:27.068
I think I'’m going into shock.

20:27.068 --> 20:28.896
- We tend to have
that effect on people.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.758
- Yeah.
- Oh, he'’s serious.

20:30.758 --> 20:32.137
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, okay.

20:32.137 --> 20:33.103
- He'’s actually really,
really heavy.

20:33.103 --> 20:34.310
- Bite down on this, sir.

20:34.310 --> 20:36.000
- Whoo.
- Honestly, you guys

20:36.000 --> 20:37.724
are better than Third Eye.
- Thank you!

20:37.724 --> 20:38.965
I felt that, when we were--

20:38.965 --> 20:40.551
- Oh, hey, check it out.

20:40.551 --> 20:42.241
This dude really knows
how to party, huh?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.862
- I haven'’t touched
the stuff in years,

20:43.862 --> 20:47.275
but I feel good!
[laughter]

20:47.275 --> 20:49.655
- Hey, uh, you think your
daughter'’s into us, or what?

20:49.655 --> 20:51.344
- Yeah, what about Hannon?

20:51.344 --> 20:53.448
- [sighs] They suck.

20:53.448 --> 20:55.206
So does my life.

20:55.206 --> 20:57.931
Hey, honey!

20:57.931 --> 21:00.758
- Hey, Dad.
- You dare me to jump? [laughs]

21:00.758 --> 21:02.172
- Nope, nope, no, no.

21:02.172 --> 21:05.344
- Third time'’s a charm!
[laughs]

21:05.344 --> 21:06.896
- I think we got
another roommate, huh?

21:06.896 --> 21:08.827
- Nice.

21:12.655 --> 21:14.000
- Come on!

21:14.000 --> 21:16.655
