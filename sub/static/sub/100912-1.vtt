WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:05.213
(low, tense music)

00:23.691 --> 00:26.902
(helicopter in distance)

00:31.573 --> 00:33.701
- [Radio] 41st infantry
combat support hospital.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.495
Incoming wounded, we're
approaching your position now.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.003
- [Woman] Captain Connelly,
the transport has arrived.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.256
- [Man] Hurry,
he's bleeding out.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.385
- Get this thing clamped off.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.387
Major, help me
get his shirt off.

00:53.428 --> 00:56.390
- We were on standard
patrol, open terrain.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.099
They came out of the
trees from the west,

00:58.141 --> 00:59.560
about 160 yards out.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.729
He ran to the front and
got hit with an IED.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.146
- All right, we got
thoracic abdominal,

01:03.188 --> 01:04.857
pelvic injury.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.233
- I got hit pretty good, huh?

01:06.274 --> 01:07.275
- Prep 10 units of RPCs.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.736
- Hey, buddy, you're
gonna be okay.

01:08.777 --> 01:09.570
You're in good hands.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.655
- All right, let's move.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.032
Hey, Rios?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.992
You didn't have to do all
this just to get my number,

01:15.034 --> 01:16.660
you know, you could
have just asked.

01:18.119 --> 01:21.456
- I thought this way would
be more dramatic, you know?

01:21.498 --> 01:24.376
(soft, reflective music)

01:24.418 --> 01:25.669
- Hang in there, Rios.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.274
- [Radio] Today we're
here with Russel Ashton

01:47.315 --> 01:50.235
of the United Animal
Protection Agency.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.947
We're gonna speak
about the major passing

01:52.988 --> 01:55.240
of a recent Title 23.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.742
- [Radio] Good morning, Trent.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.577
We at the UAPA want to
enforce the importance

01:58.619 --> 02:01.246
of this title, as
it protects animals

02:01.288 --> 02:03.331
from terrible and potentially
dangerous situations.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.333
- [Radio] I understand, but
what I'm concerned about--

02:05.375 --> 02:08.796
anybody driving by
saying "I saw thin animals,"

02:08.837 --> 02:11.298
and that's enough to
launch an investigation

02:11.339 --> 02:12.674
on any rancher's herd.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.051
- [Radio] It's the
animal's well-being

02:14.093 --> 02:15.594
that comes first and
foremost, period.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.433
- [Sheriff] Let's take a look

02:21.475 --> 02:22.601
at this sick horse, Hoag.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.227
- [Hoag] Of course.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.813
I'm not sure what to do.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.231
I've never seen
something like this.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
- That just don't look good.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.819
- Uh-oh.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.278
Let's get back to work.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.418
- Morning, boys.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.253
Josh Falvey, Fergus Falls Daily.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.213
- What brings you out so early?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.299
- Well, Sunday piece coming
out in a couple weeks

02:54.341 --> 02:56.135
on how ranchers have fared
through the winter.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.345
These Hoag Rafferty's horses?

02:58.386 --> 02:59.930
- Yeah.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.765
And they'll be coming
through winter just fine.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.267
We'll get them there.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.770
- Hoag's in the barn
with the sheriff now.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.148
Going over their compliance.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.941
They went pretty well

03:10.983 --> 03:12.860
and grass is coming,
just around the corner.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.319
- Yeah.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.779
- Remember that for
your Sunday piece.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.031
- I will do.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.282
- We got a bale for ya.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.492
- Thanks, but no thanks.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.090
- Winter's been hard
on all of us, Roger.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.385
- I understand, Hoag.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.429
We all do.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.224
(soft tense music)

03:51.857 --> 03:53.567
- I know.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.822
We gonna get some
meat on those bones.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.866
(groans)

04:03.744 --> 04:05.370
(gunshot)

04:05.412 --> 04:07.288
(pants)

04:11.793 --> 04:13.503
Tom!

04:18.759 --> 04:20.677
Tom.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.097
- [Sheriff] Annie, two men
down at the Rafferty Ranch.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.682
Possible heart attack,
send an ambulance.

04:25.724 --> 04:29.228
Second man down,
fatal gunshot wound.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.106
Possible accident,
probable suicide.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.694
(cell phone vibrating)

04:50.331 --> 04:53.168
- If this is the wrong number
I'm gonna hunt you down.

04:53.210 --> 04:58.048
- I take it you're still
6,719 miles away from me?

04:58.090 --> 05:00.134
- No, actually I'm on the beach.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.177
Yeah, feeling the sand.

05:02.219 --> 05:06.265
Sipping on a daiquiri,
watching all the sexy men surf.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.894
- Listen, your dad is fine
but he collapsed yesterday.

05:12.604 --> 05:13.855
- What happened?

05:13.897 --> 05:15.440
- Heart attack.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.609
I was quickly reminded
I'm not family.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.820
I tried, they wouldn't
tell me squat.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.280
- They release him?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.197
- In a few days.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.366
You better talk to
your CO and get home.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.830
- I mean, isn't there
a private nurse

05:29.871 --> 05:31.706
that can take care
of him or something?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
- Yeah, her name
is Janna Connelly.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.866
Oh, do you have another
one, by any chance?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.617
I just gave out
my last single.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.166
- Wait a second.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.502
You want me to give you
a 10 and a one?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.088
- Yeah, if you give
me another one

07:01.129 --> 07:02.839
I can you give you a five
and two quarters back.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.385
Listen, I'm just out of singles.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.969
Otherwise I have to
give you 18 quarters.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.434
- Let me get this straight.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.020
You want me to give
you a 10 and a one,

07:17.062 --> 07:22.650
making that 11 dollars
for an energy drink

07:22.692 --> 07:24.611
and a bag of trail mix?

07:24.652 --> 07:25.486
- Yeah.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.325
- Are you playing me?

07:33.287 --> 07:35.496
- I'll just take it
out of the tip jar.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.126
- Excuse me, Officer, are
you Carl Hagen, by any chance?

07:39.167 --> 07:39.918
- What's that?

07:41.628 --> 07:44.756
- Yeah, I knew you as PK,
the preachers kid.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.549
God, I never pictured
you in law enforcement

07:46.591 --> 07:48.468
or growing up to be sheriff.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.430
- I'm Deputy Carl Haggen,
do we know each other?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.308
- Yeah, I'm Janna Connelly,
we went to high school together.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.312
- Oh, shit.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.813
Janna Banana?

07:59.854 --> 08:00.814
- You remember me, don't you?

08:00.855 --> 08:03.317
- Yeah, of course I do.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.402
- God, Paxton County
Sheriff suits you.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.445
(laughs)

08:06.486 --> 08:08.571
- Yeah, yeah, well.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.531
Deputy-- it will be
awhile till I'm Sheriff.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.161
- Right.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.665
Okay, well I'm gonna
head up to the ranch, so.

08:18.706 --> 08:19.458
- Yeah.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.541
- It was good to see you.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.085
- Yeah, it was good
to see you, too.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.753
- Deputy Carl.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.046
- I'll see you around, Banana.

08:26.089 --> 08:26.840
- See you around.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.677
Whew!

08:37.309 --> 08:39.978
(low, somber music)

09:01.958 --> 09:03.835
(horse whinnies)

09:08.256 --> 09:09.049
Jack?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.054
Hey boy, remember me?

09:16.264 --> 09:18.183
Yeah.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.893
Yeah, there you are.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.193
- Looks like he missed you.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.487
Sorry, ma'am, I didn't
mean to startle you.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.031
Dell's ranch hand, Brock,
Brock McCarty.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.449
- Oh.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.743
No, you just caught me
off guard.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.619
I'm Janna Connelly.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.746
- I know.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.997
He's been expecting
you at some point,

09:41.039 --> 09:42.749
we just didn't know when.

09:42.790 --> 09:43.583
- Yeah.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.793
Yeah.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.837
How is he?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.424
Dell.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.301
- He's been home for
about a week or so.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.720
He's tired... as expected.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.765
Had to force him to sit in
that old chair by the TV.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.308
He's got to learn to leave
all the heavy lifting

10:00.350 --> 10:02.602
to others for awhile, though.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.895
- I'm sure
he doesn't like that.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.564
- Oh no, sure doesn't.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.946
Old Jack likes a body brush.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.490
Likes the soft bristles.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.868
Ain't that right, boy?

10:18.910 --> 10:20.495
Here you go.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.413
That's a good boy.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.585
- He trusts you.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.295
- He knows
I mean him no harm.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.879
Been here about
three months now.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.798
Just getting to know each other.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.758
Isn't that right, Jackie boy?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.760
- Well, it looks like they've
both been in good hands.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.015
(TV plays in background)

11:26.561 --> 11:28.438
- Welcome home.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.953
(soft, reflective music)

12:02.305 --> 12:04.807
- You went away
and grew up on me.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.103
- Yeah, I guess I did.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.359
So the doctor said
atrial flutter?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.734
Now, we got to be
careful about that.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.153
That can be dangerous.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.573
- It was a flutter,
it was nothing.

12:20.865 --> 12:21.949
I was overdoing it with Tom,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.910
and hell, Old Man Rafferty

12:23.951 --> 12:25.495
decided he didn't want
any more of winter,

12:25.537 --> 12:28.039
and when the gun went off,
it caught me off guard is all.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.959
- He have any family left?

12:37.215 --> 12:39.008
- I think he outlived
everyone around him.

12:40.677 --> 12:44.222
Big ranch,
isolation like that,

12:44.264 --> 12:46.974
old man, Dakota winters.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.393
You put all that together,

12:48.435 --> 12:49.603
a man will do some
desperate things.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.106
- Yeah.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.323
(soft instrumental music)

13:06.703 --> 13:09.872
(kettle whistling)

13:26.139 --> 13:28.516
- I want to go
lay in that new trough.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.934
- Sounds good.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.770
Look who's up.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.772
- Yeah.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.189
Dell, I hate
to break it to you

13:35.231 --> 13:36.650
but you're not gonna
walk to the bathroom

13:36.691 --> 13:39.277
until we go over your
meds, check your BP.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.819
- Calvary's arrived.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.196
- That's right.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.157
Half-awake but
fully operational.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.715
- Morning, Dell.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.924
- Morning, Roger.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.471
- Deputy.
- Ms. Connelly.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.764
- You remember Janna?

14:07.806 --> 14:10.141
- It's been awhile,
but I sure do.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.519
Carl said he ran into you
coming to town last night.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.894
- Yeah.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.355
Paxton sure
hasn't changed much.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.856
- Well, now, a big
captain in the Army.

14:17.898 --> 14:18.857
Medic on leave.

14:18.899 --> 14:19.942
Just came home to help me

14:19.984 --> 14:21.444
with a few things
around the ranch.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.696
- Well, appreciate your service.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.156
You do Paxton proud.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.949
- Thank you,
appreciate yours, as well.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.285
- This is Brock, our ranch hand.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.206
What brings you all the
way out here, Roger?

14:33.247 --> 14:35.333
- Take a walk with me
a minute, Dell?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.046
Must be nice having
your daughter back
after all this time.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.840
- Well, it is.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.050
She wasn't too keen on
coming back to Paxton.

14:44.091 --> 14:47.554
We got some things to
work out, but it's good.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.641
So I know you didn't
come all this way

14:51.683 --> 14:52.975
to check on old Dell Connelly.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.395
- The old man's
suicide shook up things

14:55.436 --> 14:57.355
pretty good in Bismarck.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.065
- Oh?

14:59.106 --> 15:01.025
- The UAPA got wind of
Hoag, got out to his ranch

15:01.067 --> 15:03.444
and did an inspection
of his herd.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.405
You know, you were there.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.907
- His animals came out
of winter all right.

15:07.948 --> 15:11.118
Hell, he's no skinnier than
I am coming out of winter.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.080
- Yeah, well there's new
directives coming down the pike

15:14.121 --> 15:16.040
from the States Attorney's
office because of it.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.460
It's called the Title 23.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.503
Spot inspections.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.382
Felony counts for
non-compliance.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.092
- What?

15:26.133 --> 15:28.845
- It's the vets that have
the enforcement power, Dell.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.264
Court's gonna act
without informing owners,

15:31.305 --> 15:33.600
taking livestock based solely
on someone's complaint.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.937
- I don't know of one rancher,
not around here,

15:37.978 --> 15:40.440
who neglects
or abuses his animals.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.359
But I do see why you
came out here now.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.866
- Yeah, so you got
some fencing issues,

15:49.908 --> 15:53.912
cracked tank heater, and found
some mold in the barn stacks.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.997
- Yeah, appreciate
you stopping by.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.417
- Thanks for your time, Dell.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.502
We'll be seeing ya.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.550
- [Janna] What was
all that about?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.969
- About the reputation
of our ranch, is what.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.014
Sale of horses, yearlings...

16:14.056 --> 16:15.934
they depend on it.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.394
We lose that,
we lose everything.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.104
- Well, these fixes are doable.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.230
Brock and I--

16:21.272 --> 16:22.649
- No, it's about more than that.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.151
I've had that same list
for Brock for two months

16:25.192 --> 16:27.153
that the deputy
handed us today.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.571
That should of been
done by now.

16:28.613 --> 16:29.447
There's no excuse for that.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.324
I pay him enough.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.117
- Well, Dell, in all fairness,
Brock's been pulling

16:33.159 --> 16:35.286
double duty
since you've been laid up.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.746
- Just leave that, girl.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.623
And he should of been
pulling triple duty.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.334
Horses and sheep, they
don't wait for somebody

16:41.375 --> 16:42.627
to come around.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.253
Unless you've forgotten
how to ranch.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.633
- Forgotten?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.593
Forgotten how I went to
work when your most precious

16:50.635 --> 16:53.429
ranch was stake?

16:53.471 --> 16:55.890
Forgotten how you leaned on
me at 14 to fill her shoes?

16:58.518 --> 16:59.727
Shit, you know,
I didn't kill her, Dell,

16:59.769 --> 17:01.562
but you sure
treat me like I did.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.487
Yeah, let's not have a
conversation about this,

17:09.529 --> 17:11.572
you're right.

17:11.614 --> 17:15.075
And I haven't been a girl
in a long time.

17:24.711 --> 17:30.132
So, Sheriff came by to
talk about fencing issues,

17:30.174 --> 17:32.010
couple gaps by the
road, field fixes.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.303
Normal post code
of winter stuff.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.972
- Routine.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.683
- He got really
upset about it,

17:38.725 --> 17:40.142
and so he started
pushing buttons,

17:40.184 --> 17:42.228
I started pushing back and then

17:42.269 --> 17:44.313
all of a sudden
it's like I'm 14 again.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.816
Just stuck in that
tiny little box.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.776
- Didn't take long, did it?

17:50.904 --> 17:52.363
- No.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.285
- Look, I'm sorry,

17:58.327 --> 18:00.538
I just thought
you should be here.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.124
- No, listen, when you
called, I was coming off

18:04.166 --> 18:05.793
of 36 hour shifts.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.929
God, I was working
on this young guy,

18:15.970 --> 18:18.681
just choking in a
pool of his own blood.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.019
I mean I didn't even
grab the paddles,

18:23.061 --> 18:24.771
I just, I knew it was over.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.147
(tense music)

18:29.984 --> 18:32.152
I just held his hand,
talking about the date

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
we were gonna on someday.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.406
Where are you gonna take me?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.908
We going to dinner?

18:36.950 --> 18:37.742
A movie?

18:39.827 --> 18:40.620
- Don't let me die.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.331
(somber music)

18:49.003 --> 18:52.506
- He shut his eyes
and died on the table.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.591
We're losing blood.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.468
Get me another clamp.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.510
Guys come on, hurry.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.599
(flat line beeping)

19:03.643 --> 19:06.020
That's how I felt back--
back at the house with Dell,

19:06.062 --> 19:08.022
just so far apart,

19:08.064 --> 19:09.983
like I couldn't
save him either.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.495
(phone rings)

19:22.536 --> 19:23.913
Take it, sorry.

19:25.999 --> 19:26.791
- Hello?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.878
Okay.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.212
I'll be right there.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.175
- No, you can't leave me.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.594
- Keltin got caught on
a fence halfway over it.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.553
Torn up pretty good.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.851
Just breathe.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.979
All right you and Dell both
work on your stubborn ways

19:48.021 --> 19:49.522
back home again.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.150
- I know.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.234
- When you come in for
that kind of approach,

19:54.276 --> 19:55.611
it's always a little bumpy.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.240
- Nice shot, Haggen.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.715
(country music)

20:15.756 --> 20:18.801
♪ Something never
looks so right ♪

20:18.843 --> 20:22.680
♪ There was trouble up ahead ♪

20:22.722 --> 20:27.393
♪ I'm hitting
every green light ♪

20:27.434 --> 20:31.022
♪ You know I'm
due to hit a red ♪

20:33.691 --> 20:35.234
- Hi, Carl.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.028
- Fireball shots on me.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.780
- Oh, uh.

20:39.822 --> 20:40.948
Thanks, but I'm okay.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.659
I wouldn't want you
pulling me over.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.995
You know buzzed driving
is drunk driving.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.621
- No, I would never do that.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.498
I wouldn't do that
to Janna Banana.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.625
Firm warning, maybe.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.460
- You just keep calling
me that, don't ya?

20:53.502 --> 20:56.630
- You know I love the songs
you put on the jukebox, Janna.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.257
Dicky Peterson.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.508
The High Lonesome.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.011
(whistles)

21:02.053 --> 21:04.097
- Oh, watch your
step there, Carl.

21:04.138 --> 21:05.264
Oh, lordy.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.225
- Fiery.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.602
That's what I remember
about you, is you,

21:09.643 --> 21:11.645
you were fiery.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.605
- Sweetheart, um.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.439
- What?

21:16.400 --> 21:17.818
- Ever seen the
movie "Braveheart"?

21:20.362 --> 21:22.448
- Oh, I love that movie.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.366
- Starting to look a lot
like William Wallace.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.207
- I got a bunch of blue
chalk all over my face?

21:31.249 --> 21:32.250
- Yeah, just a little bit.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.961
(laughs)

21:35.002 --> 21:35.795
- Okay.

21:37.088 --> 21:37.880
Uh.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.341
I think I better go home now.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.933
I still like the songs you
put on the jukebox, Banana.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.059
- Bye, Carl.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.065
To Paxton's finest.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.359
(men shouting in background)

21:59.401 --> 22:00.653
- No help firing a shot.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.239
My compliments.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.951
- Yeah, it's a gift.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.411
I happen to work
with a lot of men.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.997
My father's one of them.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.255
- You mind if I join you?

22:21.548 --> 22:22.633
- Yes.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.763
- I won't breathe
on you, I promise.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.016
Unless, of course,
you want me to

22:30.057 --> 22:32.643
then actually I'm
open for negotiations.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.315
It's kind of sad
drinking alone.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.399
- Oh, I'm not sad.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.818
Just alone.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.737
- I was talking about me.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.701
Saddest, loneliest cowboy
in Paxton County.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.206
Might help if I could
tell you a joke.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.708
- Oh, really?

22:55.749 --> 22:57.417
All right,
let's hear it, cowboy.

22:58.836 --> 22:59.586
- All right.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.341
A horse walks into a bar,

23:03.381 --> 23:07.678
looks kind of lonely,
orders a couple mojitos.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.723
Bartender says,
hey why the long face?

23:12.141 --> 23:13.809
- Oh, that's it?

23:13.851 --> 23:16.394
(laughs)

23:16.436 --> 23:18.438
That's the stupidest
joke I've ever head.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.609
You should try standup.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.486
- Really?
- No.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.072
(laughs)

23:26.113 --> 23:28.448
- Could we get two of
whatever Braveheart was...

23:28.490 --> 23:30.076
Uh, name's Matt.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.411
- Janna.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.663
- My friends call me--

23:34.705 --> 23:36.414
- Let me ask you something.

23:36.456 --> 23:40.753
This whole easy going southern
cowboy thing work for you?

23:40.794 --> 23:43.839
- Well, ma'am, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

23:43.881 --> 23:46.466
but I like where it's going.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.426
- All right, fine, cowboy.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.804
I can do drinks.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.015
But anything else
ain't happening.

23:53.057 --> 23:56.102
(country rock music)

24:07.405 --> 24:10.116
- I think old Deputy Carl
dodged a bullet with you.

24:14.828 --> 24:18.165
- Will you stop talking
and take my pants off?

24:33.555 --> 24:35.975
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

24:36.016 --> 24:36.767
Holy shit.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.883
(soft, tense music)

25:22.688 --> 25:24.982
- You go check the barn.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.775
Go check the fence.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.068
- Brock!

25:29.862 --> 25:31.197
Janna!

25:40.622 --> 25:41.539
- Morning.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.460
- Morning, Matt.

25:49.131 --> 25:52.926
- You know, I make a mean
bacon and egg scramble.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.306
- God, that sounds so good.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.475
I...

26:00.851 --> 26:02.602
I gotta head, but...

26:04.063 --> 26:05.064
Thank you.

26:06.857 --> 26:10.277
(soft country guitar music)

26:23.581 --> 26:26.126
- [Morel Voiceover]
Connelly Ranch, case 19.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.627
Doctor Morel field report.

26:29.004 --> 26:29.880
The property in disrepair.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.467
Recommending further
investigation.

26:37.179 --> 26:40.974
(phone ringing)

26:41.016 --> 26:42.351
- [Phone] Hi,
thanks for calling.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.853
You've reached Marla
Orton, leave a message.

26:44.895 --> 26:48.190
- Oh, God you are in
deep trouble for leaving me
last night.

26:48.232 --> 26:49.858
Please call me back
as soon as you can.

26:49.900 --> 26:50.943
Thank you.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.574
- Which one was it?

26:56.614 --> 26:58.242
- Old draft horse
in the first stall.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.245
His ears were hanging down.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.038
I checked his nose
and nasal passages.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.039
There's a lot of discharge.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.750
- What's that mean?

27:06.792 --> 27:08.502
- Well, possible Herpes virus.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.046
Too early for
Potomac Horse Fever.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.839
He's past vet intervention.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.508
Should we tag the foal?

27:15.675 --> 27:17.428
- Well.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.679
- What other horses have
been near this stall?

27:25.102 --> 27:28.021
- I don't know what
else to tell you, Dell.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.108
Vet said the virus
is contagious.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.861
Now the foal has
to be quarantined.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.197
So, it's bad luck.

27:39.492 --> 27:44.204
- Jack was Adeline's
horse, Roger.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.002
She had him
since he was a foal.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.005
- Yeah, I know.

27:55.715 --> 28:00.262
But doing the right thing is
rarely doing the easy thing.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.350
Looking out for the
rest of your herd,

28:04.391 --> 28:05.809
now that's doing
the right thing.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.771
- I know it is.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.448
- Now, I wouldn't
ask you to do this

28:19.490 --> 28:21.241
unless I'd do it myself for ya.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.390
- How'd you get so sick, huh?

28:47.142 --> 28:50.812
I'm gonna put you off
in the back quarter,

28:50.854 --> 28:53.399
by that little knoll you liked
so much when summers came.

28:57.528 --> 29:00.447
I won't ever visit
that I won't think about

29:00.489 --> 29:02.115
what you meant to us.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.285
I'll have it written...

29:07.413 --> 29:09.498
"Here lies the one
that loved us all."

29:16.922 --> 29:18.840
"And in turn
was loved as much."

29:20.259 --> 29:23.011
(soft somber music)

29:26.765 --> 29:28.141
(gunshot)

30:11.101 --> 30:11.851
- Dell?

30:15.897 --> 30:17.190
What's the matter?

30:21.695 --> 30:22.696
Where's Brock?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.875
What the fuck?

30:35.917 --> 30:37.503
Where's his shit?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.683
(soft, reflective music)

31:25.342 --> 31:26.677
I'm sorry.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.556
I'm sorry.

31:32.265 --> 31:35.101
I should of been here,
I'm sorry.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.070
- She loved that horse.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.137
Morning.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.140
- Morning.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.309
- Can I get you more tea?

32:16.351 --> 32:17.477
- No, I'm okay, thank you.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.316
They took Sugar, too?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.110
- They did.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.698
- Do we even know where?

32:35.579 --> 32:37.163
- They said they'd let us know.

32:38.540 --> 32:39.291
- That's comforting.

32:43.545 --> 32:44.504
- New guidelines.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.802
- Lack of care for livestock,
pasture too short.

32:49.843 --> 32:52.971
Feed purchase records,
inaccessible roads.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.141
I mean, they're making us
sound like accused criminals.

33:04.608 --> 33:07.444
And then I took that
out of Jack's nostril.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.618
- I'll send it out right away.
When I get the results,

33:14.660 --> 33:17.078
I'll come out and
check on some animals.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.622
- God, I just don't get it.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.751
- It's the result
of this new law.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.210
You know, piss off
the wrong neighbor

33:24.252 --> 33:27.005
can cause you
a lot of trouble.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.007
A person can falsely accuse
a rancher of abuse,

33:29.048 --> 33:31.009
causing them to go broke
just to prove their innocence.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.928
Cost them nothing,
cost you the ranch.

33:34.387 --> 33:35.973
- No wonder the old
man killed himself.

33:38.183 --> 33:41.060
- How's mister beautiful
man in the bunkhouse,

33:41.102 --> 33:43.522
the one you were talking
about, how's he taking it?

33:43.563 --> 33:44.731
- Oh, he's not.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.525
Yeah, he just up and left.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.110
- You get what you pay for.

33:50.779 --> 33:54.240
- God, I need someone out
there Dell can really count on.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.117
- Oh, wait I might have a guy.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.995
He was just in here for a
client looking for a place

33:58.036 --> 33:59.245
to work and sleep.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.831
- Really?

34:00.873 --> 34:02.374
- Yeah, go to Mr. Mom's diner,
his name's Hudson.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.459
I'll call him, I'll explain
everything so he knows.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.127
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.212
- Of course.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.255
Bye.
- Okay, I love you.

34:10.841 --> 34:11.591
- Good luck.

34:16.346 --> 34:17.723
- Thank you.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.474
Can I also get the check
when you have a chance?

34:19.516 --> 34:20.392
- Of course.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.157
- Shit.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.784
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

34:37.826 --> 34:41.496
(phone buzzing)

34:41.538 --> 34:42.873
- [Phone] He show up yet?

34:42.915 --> 34:44.624
- No, but I did run
into the guy that

34:44.666 --> 34:46.585
to me to the Ritz R and R.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.336
- No.
- Yeah.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.964
Yeah, he's sitting at the
counter and he is not happy.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.174
God, this is embarrassing.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.010
- [Phone] The only thing worse
than waking up with a guy

34:55.052 --> 34:58.055
in the first day is
seeing him on the second.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.306
- What's your guy
look like again?

35:00.348 --> 35:01.767
- [Phone] Hudson?

35:01.808 --> 35:04.561
Blonde hair, blue eyes,
about six foot one.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.646
Oh, and he kind of
can't grow a beard.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.775
- I gotta go.

35:22.120 --> 35:22.913
Hey.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.834
Your last name wouldn't by any
chance be Hudson, would it?

35:31.671 --> 35:33.090
Oh.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.051
(soft guitar music)

35:36.093 --> 35:38.095
- [Matt] Wow, this all yours?

35:38.136 --> 35:39.429
- My family's.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.264
- It's beautiful.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.100
- Used to have 160
horses at some point

35:43.141 --> 35:44.893
when I was a kid.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.020
Then Dell hired this Brock guy,

35:47.062 --> 35:49.689
he just took off.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.149
Too much for him I guess.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.569
- Yeah, I've known some
ranch hands like that.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.154
They like the idea
of being a cowboy

35:56.195 --> 35:58.615
just not the real work.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.617
This Brock guy though,
he might take the cake.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.035
All along your fence
there, you got a bunch

36:02.077 --> 36:04.370
of baling wire patch jobs.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.915
Anybody even trying would of
replaced the whole length.

36:06.957 --> 36:08.667
- You think it was deliberate?

36:08.708 --> 36:10.919
- Well, I don't want to talk
bad about a stranger, but...

36:14.006 --> 36:14.965
- All right.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.385
Well, I got to make a decision.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.887
So we got a deal?

36:22.097 --> 36:24.390
- Moneys fine, bunkhouse is fine

36:24.432 --> 36:26.225
but I do have one request.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.979
- What's that?
- Next time you got

36:29.021 --> 36:30.313
an itch that
needs scratching

36:30.355 --> 36:32.065
and you come a knocking,
I'm gonna ask you

36:32.107 --> 36:33.775
to know my full name
before we commence.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.152
- Oh, a cowboy with
principles, huh?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.111
- Yes, ma'am.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.487
(laughs)

36:37.529 --> 36:39.322
- You're gonna make me
pay for this aren't you?

36:39.364 --> 36:40.115
- Yes, ma'am.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.450
- Okay.

36:45.829 --> 36:47.622
- The mucus test came back.

36:47.664 --> 36:48.915
Old Jack was sick all right

36:50.792 --> 36:52.169
- What was it?

36:52.210 --> 36:55.254
- EHV-1, equine herpes virus.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.923
Really contagious.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.217
- We've never had that before.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.719
- It happens.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.805
I feel bad but, he
might of died anyway.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.140
You did the right thing, Dell.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.442
This horse is fine.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.654
- What happens next?

37:19.696 --> 37:21.280
- Let's make it official, right?

37:23.033 --> 37:25.911
I'll assess the entire herd,
blood samples, everything.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.829
I can set up a feeding
and warming plant

37:27.871 --> 37:29.288
to get these animals
back into shape.

37:49.642 --> 37:50.936
- Here you go, Sheriff.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.604
- Thank you.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.438
Carl.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.858
Why don't you go over
there and casually see

37:56.900 --> 37:57.859
what you can find out.

38:01.613 --> 38:02.739
- Yeah, who is that?

38:03.865 --> 38:07.326
(upbeat instrumental music)

38:16.335 --> 38:17.420
- Oh, hi, Carl.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.256
- You getting some feed, huh?

38:19.297 --> 38:20.757
- Yup.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.467
Knocking down that
list you gave us.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.677
Don't want to be caught
short next time you come out.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.138
- Yeah, good deal.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.514
- I'm Matt Hudson,
nice meeting you.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.975
- Yeah, of course.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.477
Uh, Deputy Carl Haggen.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.271
- Yeah, Matt's our
new ranch hand.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.148
We're picking up
where Brock left off.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.650
- Yeah, what happened to him?

38:40.235 --> 38:42.320
- He just left, no idea.

38:42.361 --> 38:44.239
Found a better situation
for himself, I guess.

38:46.365 --> 38:47.450
- Well.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.038
I appreciate the compliance.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.665
I'll be sure to let
the sheriff know that.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.550
- What you find out?

39:04.592 --> 39:07.887
- Well, it looks like Ms.
Connelly's hired new ranch hand,

39:07.929 --> 39:08.888
a Matt Hudson.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.349
- A new ranch hand.

39:11.390 --> 39:12.391
Well, good for her.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.854
- Yeah.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.523
I knew her back in
high school but,

39:18.564 --> 39:21.985
never paid much attention to
her or anything like that.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.822
- I like how you handled
yourself there, Carl.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.448
You're learning.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.159
Subtly, but you're learning.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.375
- Hey.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.212
Hey.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.380
We got the list of conditions
from the state attorney.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.885
- Underweight horses?

39:46.926 --> 39:48.303
That's debatable.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.264
- Fence repair, brush
clearing, standing water.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.099
Yeah, we've seen that already.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.061
- Wait, replace bad wiring in
the water trough tank heater.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.729
Where is that?

39:57.770 --> 39:58.855
- It's up in the north field.

40:02.525 --> 40:03.985
- Yeah, sure enough,

40:04.027 --> 40:05.403
looks like you got
exposed electrical wiring.

40:05.444 --> 40:06.821
I've seen animals
electrocuted by this.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.031
- Thank God this one's dry.

40:12.869 --> 40:15.538
- Looks like ice got in there
and corroded the connections.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.751
- How did they know?

40:19.792 --> 40:21.419
- Well, everybody's
got trough heaters.

40:21.460 --> 40:24.714
- If you don't then--
- No, no, no. I mean.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.925
Did you see Dr. Morel and
her people come out here

40:26.966 --> 40:27.800
or the Sheriff?

40:29.052 --> 40:30.053
- Panel was rusted shut.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.429
Nobody's been here.

40:31.470 --> 40:32.931
- The panels rusted shut
and there's no tire marks

40:32.972 --> 40:34.307
or shoe prints.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.141
How did they know?

40:38.853 --> 40:41.147
Don't you see?

40:41.189 --> 40:42.523
It was Brock.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.317
The inspectors didn't go
out to the north field

40:44.359 --> 40:47.153
but it's right here in the state
attorney's own stationary.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.864
- You think this Brock
guy's tied all the way up

40:49.906 --> 40:51.741
to the state's
attorney's office?

40:52.325 --> 40:53.534
- No.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.703
But we know the Sheriff is.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.163
- You got no way
of proving that.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.794
- I think we need some help.

41:02.835 --> 41:03.795
Legal help.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.883
Dell Connelly, I'm
his daughter, Janna.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.302
I'm picking up from Dr. Kruger.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.804
Thank you.

41:12.845 --> 41:15.932
(soft, reflective music)

41:38.079 --> 41:38.913
- Everything okay?

41:40.665 --> 41:41.416
- Just drive.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.304
- Well (laughs),
doesn't take a genius

41:54.346 --> 41:55.347
to see what's happening here.

41:55.388 --> 41:57.640
It's this new statute.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.517
They couldn't get it
through the voters

41:59.558 --> 42:01.353
so they did an Enron,

42:01.394 --> 42:03.355
shoved it right through
the legislature.

42:05.398 --> 42:07.025
- But why?

42:07.066 --> 42:09.735
- It's these animal rights
groups like the UAPA.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.697
They have a lock on
the state, all the laws

42:12.738 --> 42:15.408
that are being implemented,
offering training

42:15.450 --> 42:17.160
to law enforcement.

42:17.202 --> 42:20.163
They moved into North Dakota
after pushing this new law.

42:20.205 --> 42:23.582
- But, why would they want
to take ranchers' horses?

42:23.624 --> 42:24.376
It doesn't make any sense.

42:24.417 --> 42:25.584
- Oh, well.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.253
Lots of reason.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.713
They'll tell you it's
because they're taking care

42:28.754 --> 42:31.632
of the animals but the truth is

42:31.674 --> 42:34.135
those horses are worth cash
whether they're healthy or not.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.554
- Okay, then so what can she do?

42:36.595 --> 42:38.264
- Well, you need to show
them you're compiling,

42:38.306 --> 42:40.392
first of all, and as soon
as I get that vet assessment

42:40.433 --> 42:43.144
from you pal Dr. Marla, the
care plan for the horses.

42:43.186 --> 42:44.479
- Yeah.
- You and I can walk

42:44.521 --> 42:45.813
it over to the
courthouse ourselves.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.148
That will buy you some time

42:47.190 --> 42:49.067
and you get that ranch in order.

42:51.861 --> 42:52.611
- Okay.

42:55.365 --> 42:56.908
- We had an agreement, Tom.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.326
(dial tone)
Tom?

42:58.368 --> 42:59.285
Tom!

43:00.870 --> 43:03.122
Tom Gardner just hung up on me.

43:03.164 --> 43:05.166
He says he doesn't have
any hay for us this year.

43:06.751 --> 43:07.710
- I have an idea why.

43:21.891 --> 43:24.810
- Now listen, Dell, we've
known each other a long time.

43:24.852 --> 43:26.896
- 35 years, Tom.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.647
- I told your pa, Janna.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.067
I just don't have
any hay to sell.

43:31.109 --> 43:34.153
- Tom, you and I
pulled hay for Hoag,

43:34.195 --> 43:36.030
what two three weeks ago?

43:36.072 --> 43:37.449
There's plenty of hay there.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.117
- Since then, I sold
to the young feller,

43:39.158 --> 43:40.701
over at Mandan.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.203
He came took everything I had.

43:42.245 --> 43:43.788
Paid top dollar, too.

43:43.829 --> 43:46.082
- This actually the truth of it?

43:46.124 --> 43:49.294
Mr. Gardner, is this why you
won't sell your hay to us?

43:49.335 --> 43:50.669
People will think it's your hay

43:50.711 --> 43:52.171
that contaminated
the Connelly ranch?

43:53.590 --> 43:55.674
Jack got put down
for EHV-1 had nothing

43:55.716 --> 43:57.718
to do with the product
coming from your ranch.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.638
- Ruth, I got this, go on.

44:00.679 --> 44:02.223
- Tom.

44:02.265 --> 44:04.683
These people, your
friends deserve the truth.

44:04.725 --> 44:05.851
You owe them that.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.775
- It's title 23.

44:12.817 --> 44:14.860
Everybody's spooked.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.989
All the ranchers are hiding
from the Sheriff and his posse.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.240
- Tom's scared
that what happened

44:19.282 --> 44:20.699
to you can happen to us, too.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.994
Sheriff visits, articles,

44:23.035 --> 44:24.787
the value of our
stock goes down.

44:26.998 --> 44:29.708
- Reputation's everything,
Dell, you know that.

44:29.750 --> 44:33.171
Any whiff of fever or
some problem with our hay,

44:33.212 --> 44:34.046
we're finished.

44:37.383 --> 44:40.136
- First they want to
take my damn livestock

44:40.178 --> 44:41.638
now they want to
take my friends.

44:43.097 --> 44:46.058
(somber tense music)

45:05.244 --> 45:07.830
- Okay, Dell, let's
see about this.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.398
- We got some calls
out on those yearlings.

45:33.439 --> 45:35.650
See if we can get
some buyers lined up.

45:35.692 --> 45:36.442
- Thank you.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.164
Okay, so you're saying the
court can act without notice?

45:50.206 --> 45:51.748
Do you know how hard we've
been working out there?

45:51.790 --> 45:53.125
They could just show up.
- I'm gonna prepare

45:53.167 --> 45:54.126
an injunction in case they do

45:54.168 --> 45:55.670
want to move on the ranch.

45:55.712 --> 45:57.672
Now if they do come,
that's all we got.

45:57.714 --> 45:59.090
So you better hope it holds up.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.849
- Absolutely not.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.851
(laughs)

46:16.107 --> 46:17.191
all right, 10 bucks.

46:18.775 --> 46:20.403
I'm impressed.

46:20.445 --> 46:21.987
- Your mother taught
me some things.

46:25.617 --> 46:26.701
- Oh!

46:31.456 --> 46:32.915
Thank you.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.375
- [Vin] We'll just
take Marla's assessment

46:34.417 --> 46:36.043
on over here to clerk's office.

46:36.085 --> 46:36.877
- [Janna] Right down here?

46:36.919 --> 46:37.670
- [Vin] Yup.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.357
- I just thought we'd get a
little color back in here.

47:00.067 --> 47:00.943
- Mom's favorites.

47:02.737 --> 47:03.696
God, she loved these.

47:05.364 --> 47:07.450
You know she used to put
them in the planter box

47:07.492 --> 47:10.119
and I'd pick em and take
em to school with me.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.954
(laughs)

47:11.996 --> 47:13.247
Hey, I made a lot of friends.

47:21.547 --> 47:23.090
- You have your mother's hands.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.014
- I didn't know that.

47:31.724 --> 47:34.519
(reflective music)

47:40.316 --> 47:42.109
You miss her, don't you?

47:44.945 --> 47:46.823
- Every hour of every day.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.628
- Morning specials, we
have pumpkin spice pancakes

48:00.670 --> 48:02.797
and maple bacon potato hash.

48:02.839 --> 48:04.298
I'll give you a
moment to decide.

48:04.340 --> 48:05.216
- Thank you.

48:07.134 --> 48:08.969
You know it's the sugar
that raises cholesterol

48:09.011 --> 48:10.596
that gives people heart disease.

48:13.015 --> 48:15.351
So Russel, how can the
Sheriff's Department

48:15.393 --> 48:17.395
help the UAPA?

48:17.436 --> 48:21.357
- You know all these ranchers
in these parts personally?

48:21.399 --> 48:22.692
- Most of them

48:22.734 --> 48:24.901
and if I don't I'm happy
to introduce myself.

48:24.943 --> 48:26.237
- How much livestock is here?

48:27.613 --> 48:28.947
- A couple thousand
head, anyway.

48:30.825 --> 48:31.826
- That's a few pesos.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.411
- More than a few, Mr. Ashton.

48:33.452 --> 48:35.580
When those horses are
shipped across the border

48:35.621 --> 48:37.248
no back tags, no certificates.

48:37.289 --> 48:38.457
It's clean.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.254
- I'll have to get firm with
a few of them in my own way

48:43.295 --> 48:45.840
but we're gonna need
that political cover.

48:47.341 --> 48:49.134
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.137
- Sorry, I've kept you waiting.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.097
Have you decided?

48:55.140 --> 48:56.141
- I think we have.

49:10.197 --> 49:11.323
- All right, you can stay.

49:12.658 --> 49:14.410
(Janna laughs)

49:14.452 --> 49:16.370
(Matt groans)

49:16.412 --> 49:18.790
- Wow, this is really something.

49:19.874 --> 49:20.708
- Yeah, it is.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.087
You know sometimes
between shifts,

49:26.963 --> 49:28.925
I'll go up by myself and
look up at the stars,

49:30.927 --> 49:33.053
think of this place, right here.

49:34.806 --> 49:36.891
- You know I think
everybody thinks about home

49:36.933 --> 49:39.393
when they want a little comfort.

49:39.435 --> 49:41.896
- Yeah, it's not
always like that.

49:45.232 --> 49:49.069
But even though I ran from this
place with everything I had

49:49.111 --> 49:50.195
I'd do anything to save it.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.367
- I don't know if I've
ever had a place like that.

49:58.412 --> 50:00.205
- Where are you from?

50:00.247 --> 50:01.707
We haven't really covered that.

50:03.417 --> 50:04.209
- Nowhere, really.

50:06.253 --> 50:07.922
A bit of a nomad.

50:07.964 --> 50:09.381
- I know the feeling.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.513
- There was a place
near Elko, Nevada.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.097
It's called the Ruby Mountains.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.140
You ever?

50:18.182 --> 50:18.975
No.

50:21.059 --> 50:22.436
It's unreal.

50:22.478 --> 50:24.814
It's like you're staring
at a dream or something.

50:27.942 --> 50:31.487
In fact, those stars
look a lot like these.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.446
- Sounds romantic.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.867
You ever taken anybody up there?

50:35.908 --> 50:36.742
- My brother.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.663
One summer we were
both ranching near Elko

50:40.705 --> 50:45.041
so we met up, hung out, just
stared at the mountains,

50:45.083 --> 50:45.877
the stars.

50:49.045 --> 50:51.924
You know if I had to pick
a spot that I'd call home

50:51.966 --> 50:54.092
I guess it be there, with him.

51:01.183 --> 51:03.769
- This one time we took
in this Afghan girl,

51:06.104 --> 51:08.482
her mother had been hit,
either by us or by them,

51:08.524 --> 51:11.861
I don't remember
but we took her in,

51:13.278 --> 51:15.781
she would have these
fits, inconsolable

51:18.367 --> 51:23.079
and one night I took
her out, it was just us,

51:25.290 --> 51:28.293
we looked up at the stars
and she stopped crying.

51:30.755 --> 51:31.714
She recognized home.

51:33.632 --> 51:36.260
- Bet she was thinking
about her mother.

51:36.301 --> 51:37.929
- Yeah.

51:37.970 --> 51:38.763
Yeah.

51:41.849 --> 51:44.685
Maybe it's not the place that
makes home, but the people?

51:48.731 --> 51:49.815
- Maybe it is the people.

51:52.693 --> 51:53.444
- To nomads.

51:54.904 --> 51:55.780
- To home.

52:05.915 --> 52:07.750
(laughs)

52:09.877 --> 52:12.504
(phone vibrating)

52:30.064 --> 52:32.483
- Why do you always
call so early?

52:32.524 --> 52:33.734
- Janna, it's happening.

52:33.776 --> 52:34.986
They're on the
move to the ranch.

52:35.027 --> 52:36.988
I'm on my way.

52:37.029 --> 52:38.530
- Shit.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.491
(tense music)

52:40.532 --> 52:41.450
Dad!

52:41.492 --> 52:42.785
Dell, wake up.

52:42.827 --> 52:44.160
Fuck.

52:44.202 --> 52:46.580
(tense music)

52:47.873 --> 52:48.874
- [Vin] This is Vin.

52:48.916 --> 52:50.584
- Hi, they're on the way.

52:50.626 --> 52:52.252
- [Vin] Okay, when you
get the seizure order,

52:52.294 --> 52:53.921
you take a picture
from your phone.

52:53.963 --> 52:55.171
I'll try to buy you some time.

52:55.213 --> 52:56.799
- Okay.

52:56.841 --> 53:01.553
(tense dramatic music)
(heart beating)

53:11.187 --> 53:11.981
Dell!

53:14.483 --> 53:15.943
They're coming to
take the horses.

53:17.695 --> 53:20.739
(tense dramatic music)

53:28.539 --> 53:31.375
- Heard you're readying
to sell a few horses.

53:31.416 --> 53:34.670
Just making sure they're
clean animals is all.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.922
It's those spot inspections
we talked about.

53:38.757 --> 53:41.135
- Looks like you already
made up your mind, Roger.

53:41.177 --> 53:43.512
(horn honks)

53:52.897 --> 53:55.024
- I'm a licensed vet registered
here in Paxton County

53:55.066 --> 53:57.943
to corroborate any
action that may be taken.

53:57.985 --> 54:00.236
Well, you're looking at
your paperwork, Dr. Morel.

54:06.493 --> 54:11.123
(tense music)
(man whistles)

54:16.503 --> 54:18.547
- [Vin] Good morning, Raymond.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.802
- Mr. Connelly, after
checking the horses,

54:23.844 --> 54:25.846
my suspicions have
been confirmed.

54:25.888 --> 54:27.014
Here's a notice of seizure.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.350
The hearing will be in not
more than 10 business days

54:30.392 --> 54:32.144
from today.

54:32.186 --> 54:34.105
- Under what authority
are you taking my animals?

54:34.146 --> 54:37.357
- Under my authority as
the vet of this county.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.150
They'll be well cared for.

54:38.192 --> 54:38.943
- Let me see that.

54:43.488 --> 54:45.741
- They can't take these animals
with this seizure order,

54:45.783 --> 54:47.159
it's incomplete.

54:47.201 --> 54:49.036
This is bullshit, Victoria.

54:49.078 --> 54:52.414
- I'm afraid you're gonna need
a judge to tell us otherwise.

54:52.456 --> 54:53.958
- [Man] All right,
let's round them up.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.463
Someone check the barn.

54:59.504 --> 55:02.007
(tense music )

55:06.137 --> 55:08.013
- Hey, Judge Williams.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.347
Nice morning, isn't it?

55:09.389 --> 55:11.142
Do you mind if I bend
your ear for a second?

55:11.183 --> 55:12.226
- Carl!

55:12.268 --> 55:14.436
Carl, why you doing this?

55:14.478 --> 55:15.687
- [Victoria] Bring out
the mares, let's go.

55:15.729 --> 55:16.814
- Push around local ranchers,

55:16.855 --> 55:18.356
people you've known
your entire life.

55:18.398 --> 55:20.901
- Yeah, yeah, I'm just
doing my job, Ms. Connelly.

55:20.943 --> 55:22.194
I'm just doing what I'm told.

55:23.279 --> 55:25.197
- That's not the preacher's
son I used to know.

55:28.117 --> 55:29.952
- [Victoria] Let's
pick up the pace.

55:29.994 --> 55:34.706
(horses neighing)
(tense music)

55:39.295 --> 55:40.378
Here goes the first trailer.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.555
- [Man] We're good.

55:54.143 --> 55:54.935
- Oof, Doc.

55:57.604 --> 55:58.730
- Watch the ramp.

56:02.985 --> 56:08.782
(man whistles)
(horse neighs)

56:08.824 --> 56:10.909
- [Janna] This isn't right.

56:10.951 --> 56:11.910
- Damn, damn.

56:13.495 --> 56:15.873
- [Man] All right,
let's head out.

56:19.084 --> 56:20.752
- Hello, Judge.

56:20.794 --> 56:21.920
You got a minute?

56:23.505 --> 56:24.256
- Fuck it.

56:26.133 --> 56:28.760
(horns blaring)

56:33.724 --> 56:34.933
We just got to buy some time.

56:36.643 --> 56:37.686
- You're gonna need to move away

56:37.728 --> 56:39.021
from the front of the trucks.

56:39.063 --> 56:42.107
You're interfering with
an officers duties.

56:42.149 --> 56:43.817
- You have a court order
based on old information.

56:43.859 --> 56:45.443
It's not too valid, Sheriff.

56:47.196 --> 56:49.907
I handed Marla's findings
into the courthouse myself.

56:49.948 --> 56:52.450
- I'm gonna arrest you
right now for obstruction,

56:52.492 --> 56:53.577
all of you, how'd that be?

56:56.955 --> 56:58.832
(phone buzzing)

56:58.874 --> 57:00.542
- You're gonna want
to answer that.

57:00.584 --> 57:03.545
- I want to answer wha--
(phone rings)

57:04.796 --> 57:05.630
- That's your judge.

57:06.882 --> 57:09.009
You're not taking our horses.

57:09.051 --> 57:09.843
- Hello?

57:11.469 --> 57:12.846
- We handed that paperwork
into Cook, ourselves.

57:12.888 --> 57:15.431
There's no way it
just went missing.

57:15.473 --> 57:18.560
- Every time we get our
heads up, they push them back

57:18.602 --> 57:20.312
down again.

57:20.354 --> 57:22.356
- Well, I'll dig through
the public county records,

57:22.398 --> 57:24.816
see if they let anything slide
between crossing their Ts

57:24.858 --> 57:26.735
and dotting their Is.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.570
- I can ask some other
vets in other counties.

57:28.612 --> 57:30.447
I'm sure somebody
like Victoria Morel

57:30.488 --> 57:32.157
has a few skeletons
in her closet.

57:33.784 --> 57:36.078
- I keep thinking
about old Hoag.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.746
- Thank you.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.957
- He just didn't have
anybody to help him.

57:39.998 --> 57:41.125
- Yeah.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.544
And no one knows
where his horses went.

57:49.758 --> 57:53.178
- I uh, I read the hit piece
the Gazette did on your dad.

57:53.220 --> 57:54.888
- To say the least.

57:54.930 --> 57:56.140
- Well, I appreciate
you coming up

57:56.181 --> 57:57.182
to Fergus Falls this morning.

57:57.224 --> 57:58.683
A long drive.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.560
What can I do for ya?

58:02.562 --> 58:04.731
- Well, I'm wanting to talk
to you about the article

58:04.773 --> 58:05.941
you wrote on Hoag Rafferty.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.986
- The rancher?

58:09.027 --> 58:11.113
- Yeah.

58:11.155 --> 58:14.658
I'm curious, you never say
what happened to his horses.

58:14.699 --> 58:15.451
- Well, um.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.245
After the coroner's
office was done,

58:18.287 --> 58:19.788
they were just
hauled off somewhere.

58:21.623 --> 58:23.417
- I noticed you
didn't get a quote,

58:23.459 --> 58:25.419
you just referred to
the coroner's report.

58:27.254 --> 58:29.589
I mean no quote from Sheriff
Bostwick who was there either?

58:33.677 --> 58:35.595
- And?

58:36.305 --> 58:38.556
- Well, a dead man in his barn
and the seizure of his horses.

58:43.645 --> 58:44.729
You're scared of something.

58:50.735 --> 58:52.529
- You weren't there.

58:52.570 --> 58:54.114
- But you were.

58:55.115 --> 58:57.742
You saw something and your
article doesn't account for it.

59:02.080 --> 59:02.873
Please.

59:08.045 --> 59:08.795
- Oh, fuck me.

59:11.589 --> 59:14.259
(low, tense music)

59:30.775 --> 59:32.444
It was more than just a suicide.

59:36.614 --> 59:40.160
See I gotten an anonymous
tip that Hoag Rafferty

59:40.202 --> 59:42.413
was neglecting his herd.

59:42.454 --> 59:44.081
Ow, shit, shit.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.667
The other ranchers were
feeding the thin animals,

59:47.709 --> 59:49.044
your father and Tom Gardner.

59:50.546 --> 59:52.464
Josh Falvey, Fergus Falls Daily.

59:52.506 --> 59:54.466
The horses weren't neglected.

59:54.508 --> 59:56.885
They were a little skinny
from winter, that's all.

59:56.927 --> 59:59.304
Your pa told me that
Rafferty was in the barn.

59:59.346 --> 1:00:01.014
I didn't think any of it.

1:00:01.056 --> 1:00:02.933
Took a few pictures
of the ranch,

1:00:02.974 --> 1:00:05.269
wanted to get a quote
from Mr. Rafferty,

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:06.853
everyday stuff.

1:00:08.772 --> 1:00:10.190
So I walked over.

1:00:10.232 --> 1:00:12.067
I looked back, I saw
your dad in the field

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:14.570
and Mr. Gardner at the truck
still getting the hay out.

1:00:16.905 --> 1:00:18.073
I went inside the barn.

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:25.872
I saw the rancher and the
sheriff over by the window.

1:00:27.541 --> 1:00:31.669
The old man was shaking,
pleading with Sheriff Bostwick.

1:00:31.711 --> 1:00:34.839
It felt like I was intruding
so I stayed behind the tractor.

1:00:34.881 --> 1:00:37.926
- It's cold, it's all the
stress.

1:00:37.968 --> 1:00:39.803
Living way the hell
out here in Cottonwind

1:00:39.844 --> 1:00:40.804
all by yourself.

1:00:42.847 --> 1:00:46.017
(tense music)

1:00:46.059 --> 1:00:48.103
- Then the Sheriff started
to work on the old man.

1:00:50.021 --> 1:00:50.939
Work on him real good.

1:00:52.399 --> 1:00:53.733
- Your wife's gone.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:00:53.775 --> 1:00:56.027
- Kids have lost interest.

1:00:56.069 --> 1:00:59.656
- It was more than the horse
the Sheriff was after.

1:00:59.697 --> 1:01:02.534
- [Sheriff] Hell of
a lot of work to do.

1:01:02.576 --> 1:01:05.287
- Then I saw him hand
the old man his gun.

1:01:05.329 --> 1:01:06.538
- Lot of sick animals.

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:13.170
- Everything I ever
worked for, Roger.

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:15.046
- I know, Hoag.

1:01:15.088 --> 1:01:17.757
- I thought he was gonna put
down the mare in the stall.

1:01:17.799 --> 1:01:19.217
- All the stress will be gone.

1:01:21.345 --> 1:01:23.054
No more pain.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:26.141
(tense dramatic music)

1:01:30.979 --> 1:01:32.897
(gunshot)

1:01:44.075 --> 1:01:45.076
- You were in the barn.

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:52.792
- I stepped out before the
sheriff could piece together

1:01:52.834 --> 1:01:54.169
that I may have seen
the whole thing.

1:01:54.211 --> 1:01:55.587
I ran to where your
father collapsed.

1:01:59.466 --> 1:02:01.885
- What, you didn't want
to go to the authorities?

1:02:01.926 --> 1:02:02.927
- I checked his record.

1:02:04.095 --> 1:02:06.056
Decorated military service.

1:02:06.097 --> 1:02:08.642
No one else to corroborate
his word against mine.

1:02:08.684 --> 1:02:10.477
The gun was in the man's hands.

1:02:10.519 --> 1:02:13.730
The Sheriff said he was there
to help him put down a horse.

1:02:15.399 --> 1:02:16.525
Caught him off guard.

1:02:19.277 --> 1:02:20.404
You pick.

1:02:20.696 --> 1:02:21.697
(scoffs)

1:02:23.823 --> 1:02:24.991
- And the horses?

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:28.704
- Um.

1:02:30.330 --> 1:02:31.789
This lady, Dr. Morel, shows up,

1:02:31.831 --> 1:02:34.918
she begins collecting
horses, separating them

1:02:34.959 --> 1:02:35.877
into different trailers.

1:02:47.305 --> 1:02:48.181
Here.

1:02:51.393 --> 1:02:52.852
That's the research
file I put together

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:55.564
when I began to dig in but uh,

1:02:55.606 --> 1:02:57.148
nothing went beyond
that, I'm afraid.

1:03:00.985 --> 1:03:01.737
- This guy.

1:03:04.531 --> 1:03:06.742
Is his name Brock McCarty?

1:03:06.783 --> 1:03:08.034
- Um.

1:03:09.953 --> 1:03:14.708
A man named... Sam Mansfield.

1:03:19.963 --> 1:03:22.257
- And he worked for Rafferty?

1:03:22.299 --> 1:03:25.385
- He did, but he quit by the
time I'd gotten out there.

1:03:30.181 --> 1:03:31.475
Hey if I'm...

1:03:33.017 --> 1:03:35.145
if I can be of any
more help to you...

1:03:37.272 --> 1:03:38.690
let me know.

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:41.777
- Thank you.

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:18.855
(soft tense music)

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:28.258
- God damn it.

1:05:35.306 --> 1:05:38.393
- Okay, Mansfield, Mansfield.

1:05:38.435 --> 1:05:40.311
They had to submit Dr. Morel's
bonafides to the court

1:05:40.353 --> 1:05:42.647
as part of her assessment right?

1:05:42.689 --> 1:05:45.983
- Well, maybe the Sheriff
knows something about that.

1:05:46.025 --> 1:05:47.485
- Let's leave him out
of this for right now.

1:05:47.527 --> 1:05:49.279
- [Dell] Are you sure?

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:50.071
- [Janna] Yeah.

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:52.990
- Here it is.

1:05:53.032 --> 1:05:55.493
Dr. Morel lists Sam Mansfield
as part of rural practice

1:05:55.535 --> 1:05:56.327
in Layman County.

1:05:58.580 --> 1:06:00.540
So Brock is connected to Morel.

1:06:00.582 --> 1:06:02.876
- They're probably
still working together.

1:06:02.918 --> 1:06:04.920
- No, it's bigger than that.

1:06:04.961 --> 1:06:06.254
We're missing something.

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:08.590
Like what are they
doing with these horses?

1:06:08.632 --> 1:06:10.717
- [Matt] Well, any
of y'all ever hear

1:06:10.759 --> 1:06:13.094
of the Blue Orchid Ranch?

1:06:13.136 --> 1:06:14.304
- No.

1:06:14.345 --> 1:06:15.889
- [Janna] Why?

1:06:15.931 --> 1:06:17.432
- There's a bunch of paperwork
here the Sheriff's Department

1:06:17.474 --> 1:06:19.726
filed before the seizure order

1:06:19.768 --> 1:06:21.770
and on this transport slip,

1:06:21.812 --> 1:06:24.522
looks like Deputy Carl
moved some of the horses

1:06:24.564 --> 1:06:27.233
to a Sarah Windgate at
a Blue Orchid Ranch.

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:31.655
And here's the address.

1:06:31.696 --> 1:06:34.825
(energetic tense music)

1:06:52.759 --> 1:06:54.719
- What do you see?

1:06:55.595 --> 1:06:57.430
- Well, they're
definitely separating
studs from the others.

1:06:58.807 --> 1:07:01.392
- Well, a good bloodline
goes for 35,000.

1:07:01.434 --> 1:07:03.728
The rest are probably getting
shipped out for processing.

1:07:03.770 --> 1:07:04.855
- Holy shit.

1:07:06.606 --> 1:07:09.066
Sarah Windgate looks an
awful like Victoria Morel.

1:07:13.571 --> 1:07:15.114
- That's how they're doing it.

1:07:15.156 --> 1:07:16.449
Morel's operating
as Sarah Windgate

1:07:16.491 --> 1:07:17.659
to get these horses shipped.

1:07:21.078 --> 1:07:21.913
Oh, my God.

1:07:21.955 --> 1:07:23.122
Oh, my God, I see Sugar.

1:07:24.499 --> 1:07:26.334
They're keeping her
here, thank God.

1:07:26.376 --> 1:07:27.711
- [Matt] Is she okay?

1:07:27.752 --> 1:07:30.171
- Yeah, she looks fine.

1:07:30.213 --> 1:07:32.131
- Okay.

1:07:32.173 --> 1:07:33.633
How do we prove all this?

1:07:35.385 --> 1:07:36.887
- Well.

1:07:37.637 --> 1:07:40.431
We know one guy who's part
of transporting horses here.

1:07:42.809 --> 1:07:44.477
Hey, Carl.

1:07:44.519 --> 1:07:46.270
You're out of uniform today.

1:07:46.312 --> 1:07:48.982
You got the day off?

1:07:49.024 --> 1:07:52.276
- Yeah, yeah, yeah day off.

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:54.195
- [Man] Your drink, miss.

1:07:54.237 --> 1:07:54.988
- Thank you.

1:07:56.531 --> 1:07:58.157
Listen, I saw you
sitting over here

1:07:58.199 --> 1:08:00.660
and I just wanted to apologize

1:08:00.702 --> 1:08:02.119
for unloading at
you on the ranch.

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:04.998
You got a job to do.

1:08:06.499 --> 1:08:08.626
I should respect that,
it's way out of line.

1:08:14.007 --> 1:08:15.425
Can I get you another one, Carl?

1:08:17.552 --> 1:08:19.930
- Yeah, sure, why not.

1:08:21.932 --> 1:08:23.058
- Take another one on my tab.

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:23.850
- [Man] Sure.

1:08:28.605 --> 1:08:30.314
- I suppose I'd feel
the same way you do

1:08:32.358 --> 1:08:33.317
if I were in your shoes.

1:08:35.612 --> 1:08:39.574
Ranchers all over
they're pissed off.

1:08:42.159 --> 1:08:43.119
- How many?

1:08:44.579 --> 1:08:45.956
- Well, Rafferty
ain't the first one.

1:08:47.916 --> 1:08:48.708
Far from it.

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:52.921
You know it's not like
I'm new to this, right.

1:08:56.591 --> 1:08:58.384
I took the classes in
my community college

1:08:58.426 --> 1:09:01.638
for law enforcement, I'm ready.

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:07.393
I thought I was at least.

1:09:07.435 --> 1:09:08.394
- No, Carl, come on.

1:09:09.479 --> 1:09:10.354
You're a good deputy.

1:09:15.485 --> 1:09:18.071
Really, honestly, I
don't know how you do it.

1:09:18.113 --> 1:09:20.865
God and that Victoria Morel.

1:09:20.907 --> 1:09:22.408
She tends to ride part and
parcel with the Sheriff,

1:09:22.450 --> 1:09:23.284
doesn't she?

1:09:28.498 --> 1:09:33.128
- That lady she, she's
a cold piece of work.

1:09:35.212 --> 1:09:37.674
- You think she's
after Dell personally?

1:09:37.715 --> 1:09:39.759
- Nah, she don't care
about no one but herself.

1:09:43.304 --> 1:09:47.475
Fact is your old man
just isn't worth as much

1:09:47.517 --> 1:09:48.893
as 70 horses.

1:09:53.064 --> 1:09:54.107
- Yeah, well speaking
of horses--

1:09:54.149 --> 1:09:55.525
- She don't even
care that I have

1:09:55.566 --> 1:09:57.360
to run these papers all
the way down to Linden.

1:09:57.401 --> 1:09:59.445
I mean can't they
just email that shit?

1:09:59.487 --> 1:10:00.989
What am I the Pony Express?

1:10:04.159 --> 1:10:05.076
- Linden?

1:10:06.452 --> 1:10:08.245
Why so far as Linden?

1:10:08.287 --> 1:10:11.916
- Ah, Sheriff's got me doing
it two or three times a week.

1:10:11.958 --> 1:10:14.502
There's a satellite office
out there by the bowling alley

1:10:14.544 --> 1:10:16.504
and it takes me about an
hour just to get back.

1:10:21.968 --> 1:10:23.594
- You work hard, Carl.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:31.686
(tense music)

1:11:06.429 --> 1:11:08.806
(tense music)

1:12:06.197 --> 1:12:08.574
(tense music)

1:12:37.728 --> 1:12:38.771
He signed them.

1:12:42.859 --> 1:12:43.734
Matt!

1:12:45.028 --> 1:12:46.696
Matt!

1:12:46.737 --> 1:12:48.239
Matt, if you--

1:12:48.281 --> 1:12:50.158
- Hey, hey, what I tell
you about protocol?

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.451
- Sorry, I'm not
here for that, dummy.

1:12:52.493 --> 1:12:53.870
Here get dry, meet me outside.

1:12:56.372 --> 1:12:59.625
- Okay so how in the
hell you'd get all this?

1:12:59.667 --> 1:13:01.585
- Dr. Morel's field office.

1:13:01.627 --> 1:13:03.254
- Dr. Morel's field office?

1:13:03.296 --> 1:13:04.922
- Yeah, and look at this.

1:13:04.964 --> 1:13:09.177
Here's an assessment for
a horse buyer in Colorado

1:13:10.970 --> 1:13:12.096
and now it reads (mumbles).

1:13:14.807 --> 1:13:17.601
- Okay, okay, so
she's confiscating
the horses illegally,

1:13:17.643 --> 1:13:20.021
messing with the paperwork,
selling them off for herself.

1:13:20.063 --> 1:13:22.273
- Yeah, and look.

1:13:25.109 --> 1:13:27.695
Here's the bill of sale
for the Rafferty horses.

1:13:28.946 --> 1:13:29.989
- Mexico.

1:13:30.031 --> 1:13:31.407
- Yeah, and north to Canada.

1:13:31.448 --> 1:13:32.867
These horses were sold illegally

1:13:32.909 --> 1:13:35.370
and look who signed it,
Sheriff Bostwick.

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:36.620
(siren in distance)

1:13:36.662 --> 1:13:37.955
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

1:13:46.923 --> 1:13:48.049
- What is this, Roger?

1:13:49.759 --> 1:13:51.094
- Hey, Sheriff.

1:13:51.135 --> 1:13:52.887
There's not gonna
be any trouble here.

1:13:55.973 --> 1:13:56.766
- Good.

1:13:58.601 --> 1:13:59.602
Dell Connelly.

1:14:01.645 --> 1:14:02.897
You're under arrest
for multiple accounts

1:14:02.939 --> 1:14:05.108
of felony animal
abuse and neglect.

1:14:05.149 --> 1:14:05.983
- What?

1:14:06.025 --> 1:14:07.860
- I'm sorry, Dell.

1:14:07.902 --> 1:14:08.778
Deputy, read him his rights.

1:14:08.819 --> 1:14:10.113
- Turn around.

1:14:10.154 --> 1:14:11.530
You have the right
to remain silent,

1:14:11.572 --> 1:14:14.825
anything you say can and
will be held against you

1:14:14.867 --> 1:14:16.660
in a court of law.

1:14:16.702 --> 1:14:18.162
You have the right
to an attorney.

1:14:18.204 --> 1:14:19.538
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:20.748
we will provide one for you.

1:14:20.790 --> 1:14:21.874
- Dad.

1:14:21.916 --> 1:14:23.584
- Do you have any questions?

1:14:23.626 --> 1:14:25.920
Do you understand your rights?

1:14:25.962 --> 1:14:27.088
- Yes.

1:14:27.130 --> 1:14:29.382
(tense somber music)

1:14:29.424 --> 1:14:30.258
- We'll get him back.

1:14:40.017 --> 1:14:42.353
- [Russel] So I thought
it was absolutely genius

1:14:42.395 --> 1:14:44.814
setting up the satellite
office out there.

1:14:44.855 --> 1:14:46.941
- [Sheriff] Yeah, we're
clear out to Linden County.

1:14:46.983 --> 1:14:49.610
- So, States Attorneys
General's office

1:14:49.652 --> 1:14:51.695
is preparing the
affidavit as we speak.

1:14:51.737 --> 1:14:52.571
Thank you.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:55.783
- As long as Dell goes for it.

1:14:57.660 --> 1:15:00.037
So this is the model
moving forward now

1:15:00.079 --> 1:15:01.414
that we have political support?

1:15:01.456 --> 1:15:03.249
- [Russel] Exactly, exactly.

1:15:05.876 --> 1:15:07.295
- Carl, thank you.

1:15:07.337 --> 1:15:10.006
Could you get the
door on the way out?

1:15:10.047 --> 1:15:11.048
- Yeah.

1:15:13.217 --> 1:15:14.510
You uh...

1:15:16.095 --> 1:15:18.389
You don't need anything else?

1:15:18.431 --> 1:15:19.890
- Just the door, Carl, thanks.

1:15:23.227 --> 1:15:25.896
(low, tense music)

1:15:31.986 --> 1:15:34.447
- [Russel] Where'd
you get the prom king?

1:15:34.489 --> 1:15:36.949
- I don't know
what got into him.

1:15:36.991 --> 1:15:38.742
- I want you with
us in there today.

1:15:39.952 --> 1:15:40.911
Hey.
- Hey.

1:15:40.953 --> 1:15:42.121
- How's my dad, he all right?

1:15:42.163 --> 1:15:43.831
- Yeah, he's a little
tired, a little shaken.

1:15:43.873 --> 1:15:45.708
Bails been set,
he'll walk today.

1:15:45.749 --> 1:15:47.543
Now it looks like they
want to make a deal.

1:15:48.585 --> 1:15:49.962
- Yeah.

1:15:50.004 --> 1:15:51.547
- Look at these.

1:15:51.588 --> 1:15:52.965
- Yeah?

1:15:53.007 --> 1:15:54.884
- Seizure orders,
livestock assessments,

1:15:54.925 --> 1:15:56.552
shipping documents,
signatures, it's all there.

1:15:56.593 --> 1:15:58.221
- You're kidding?

1:15:58.262 --> 1:15:59.889
- Yeah, they're giving
these horses new paperwork,

1:15:59.930 --> 1:16:01.765
washing their titles and
either keeping the best ones

1:16:01.807 --> 1:16:03.434
for themselves or
they sell later.

1:16:03.476 --> 1:16:05.436
The Sheriff's
getting a nice cut.

1:16:05.478 --> 1:16:06.562
- Where did you get these?

1:16:10.024 --> 1:16:12.443
- Absconded, is
that a legal term?

1:16:12.485 --> 1:16:14.695
- Oh, these are
completely inadmissible.

1:16:14.737 --> 1:16:15.738
Come on.

1:16:15.779 --> 1:16:17.781
- Well, who cares?

1:16:17.823 --> 1:16:19.200
At least we know the truth

1:16:19.242 --> 1:16:20.576
and that's a damn
good place to start.

1:16:23.246 --> 1:16:24.539
- All right, let's go.

1:16:26.957 --> 1:16:29.960
Excuse me, but where's the
States representative?

1:16:30.002 --> 1:16:32.547
- I'm Russel Ashton, United
Animal Protection Agency.

1:16:32.588 --> 1:16:34.340
We've been given the
authority from the state

1:16:34.382 --> 1:16:35.758
to act in this matter today.

1:16:35.799 --> 1:16:37.968
We provide oversight for
local law enforcement

1:16:38.010 --> 1:16:39.845
cases like these.

1:16:39.887 --> 1:16:40.888
- Okay, well it's your dime.

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:42.223
Let's hear it.

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:46.185
- We're not heartless,
Mr. Connelly.

1:16:46.227 --> 1:16:48.062
I mean we understand.

1:16:48.104 --> 1:16:51.148
It's been a tremendous
emotional and financial strain,

1:16:51.190 --> 1:16:52.983
both on you and the ranch.

1:16:53.025 --> 1:16:56.779
The settlement can end
all this today, right now.

1:16:58.739 --> 1:17:00.991
- So you're offering a deal?

1:17:01.033 --> 1:17:02.410
- Okay look.

1:17:02.452 --> 1:17:04.120
The state will drop
the felony charges

1:17:04.161 --> 1:17:07.081
if Mr. Connelly will
accept a lesser charge.

1:17:07.123 --> 1:17:09.333
- [Vin] Okay, well
what would that be?

1:17:09.375 --> 1:17:12.420
- Class A to class
C misdemeanors,
animal endangerment.

1:17:17.592 --> 1:17:20.511
- That's going to
mean the forfeiture
of your animals, Dell.

1:17:22.054 --> 1:17:24.932
Now I know it's bad, but,
uh, any future livestock

1:17:24.974 --> 1:17:27.351
will be limited to what,
five animals or less.

1:17:31.855 --> 1:17:33.399
- You want me to stop ranching?

1:17:36.735 --> 1:17:37.528
That's what you're asking.

1:17:38.862 --> 1:17:41.240
(tense music)

1:17:50.458 --> 1:17:53.544
- So this is how you do it?

1:17:53.586 --> 1:17:55.630
I mean to date you haven't
told us where you've taken

1:17:55.671 --> 1:17:57.965
our foal or the horses
of other ranchers.

1:17:58.007 --> 1:17:59.716
You've done nothing
but stonewall.

1:18:03.429 --> 1:18:05.222
I came home from
serving my country

1:18:05.264 --> 1:18:07.183
because my father was sick

1:18:07.850 --> 1:18:09.726
and I found the town I
grew up in even sicker.

1:18:11.479 --> 1:18:13.189
Good men and lifelong
friends turning on each other

1:18:13.230 --> 1:18:14.690
out of fear.

1:18:14.731 --> 1:18:15.732
The fear you've caused.

1:18:17.776 --> 1:18:19.111
Now this land, to make
something out of it

1:18:19.153 --> 1:18:21.280
is hard enough, Mr. Ashton.

1:18:21.322 --> 1:18:24.033
Something I'm assuming
you know nothing about

1:18:24.074 --> 1:18:26.410
and then you come in here
with all the title 23s

1:18:26.452 --> 1:18:28.663
you can write and set out
to destroy a way of life

1:18:30.914 --> 1:18:32.333
and more importantly the
families that have been

1:18:32.375 --> 1:18:33.417
here for generations.

1:18:37.171 --> 1:18:38.088
So.

1:18:39.340 --> 1:18:41.592
Here's what's gonna happen.

1:18:41.634 --> 1:18:44.428
We're gonna pass on your
oh so very generous deal,

1:18:44.470 --> 1:18:45.846
thank you by the way.

1:18:47.264 --> 1:18:48.516
Bails been set.

1:18:49.892 --> 1:18:51.268
Dell's walking
out of here today.

1:18:52.478 --> 1:18:54.855
(tense music)

1:18:56.691 --> 1:19:00.277
- Well, gentlemen, looks like
we'll be seeing you in court,

1:19:00.319 --> 1:19:01.445
doesn't it?

1:19:04.781 --> 1:19:07.159
(tense music)

1:19:16.419 --> 1:19:19.129
(dramatic music)

1:19:22.925 --> 1:19:25.302
Harper Lee couldn't of
said it better herself.

1:19:25.344 --> 1:19:26.970
- I'm still shaking.

1:19:27.012 --> 1:19:27.763
- Now what?

1:19:29.098 --> 1:19:30.391
- Well, we know
what the truth is.

1:19:30.433 --> 1:19:32.184
Just got to find a
way to let it out.

1:19:32.226 --> 1:19:32.976
- Legally.

1:19:34.687 --> 1:19:36.855
- Sheriff, you better pull
something out of your ass

1:19:36.897 --> 1:19:40.401
because if you don't,
we are all going down.

1:19:40.443 --> 1:19:42.819
(tense music)

1:20:30.367 --> 1:20:32.745
- [Josh Voiceover] The
old man was shaking,

1:20:32.787 --> 1:20:34.121
pleading with Sheriff Bostwick.

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:38.834
- [Hoag Voiceover] I'm at
the end of my rope, Roger.

1:20:46.258 --> 1:20:49.470
(low, eerie music)

1:20:51.221 --> 1:20:52.264
- [Josh Voiceover] Then
the Sheriff started

1:20:52.306 --> 1:20:53.808
to work on the old man.

1:20:55.267 --> 1:20:56.811
Work on him real good.

1:20:56.852 --> 1:20:59.814
- Nothing to be ashamed about.

1:20:59.855 --> 1:21:03.567
There comes a time, an age,
best not to be a burden.

1:21:03.609 --> 1:21:05.653
- [Josh Voiceover] Then I saw
him hand the old man his gun.

1:21:05.695 --> 1:21:10.240
- [Sheriff Voiceover]
Relief, closure, solace.

1:21:11.325 --> 1:21:12.117
Failure.

1:21:13.577 --> 1:21:15.454
(gunshot)

1:21:17.498 --> 1:21:20.250
(eerie tense music)

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:51.741
(glass cracks)

1:22:15.055 --> 1:22:16.724
- [Dispatch] Carl, we got call.

1:22:16.766 --> 1:22:19.810
Possible 59-24 out of the
abandoned Rafferty Ranch.

1:22:24.648 --> 1:22:26.024
- Yeah.

1:22:26.066 --> 1:22:27.025
Uh.

1:22:27.067 --> 1:22:28.736
What's that mean again?

1:22:30.070 --> 1:22:31.321
- [Dispatch] Trespassing, Carl.

1:22:32.698 --> 1:22:35.242
(low, tense music)

1:22:42.499 --> 1:22:44.585
(gasps)

1:22:46.211 --> 1:22:47.463
- Be all you can be.

1:22:54.261 --> 1:22:55.429
- Okay.

1:22:58.307 --> 1:23:01.351
- I'm not going to
jail because of you.

1:23:07.274 --> 1:23:09.401
(grunting)

1:23:19.703 --> 1:23:20.579
Ah, damn!

1:23:22.289 --> 1:23:24.500
(grunts)

1:23:24.541 --> 1:23:25.292
(screaming)

1:23:25.334 --> 1:23:26.126
Bitch!

1:23:27.336 --> 1:23:28.462
Shit.

1:23:34.885 --> 1:23:35.928
Get back here.

1:23:37.346 --> 1:23:38.555
- Get off of me!

1:23:39.723 --> 1:23:40.474
Let go.

1:23:50.818 --> 1:23:52.862
- You thought you could end me?

1:23:52.903 --> 1:23:55.948
(tense dramatic music)

1:24:08.168 --> 1:24:10.587
(wet crunch)

1:24:12.255 --> 1:24:14.257
(coughing)

1:24:22.933 --> 1:24:25.477
(phone ringing)

1:24:42.536 --> 1:24:44.663
- Well, is it over?

1:24:46.122 --> 1:24:49.585
- Oh, Sheriff, we're
just getting started.

1:24:49.626 --> 1:24:52.046
(low, tense music)

1:25:13.984 --> 1:25:14.944
- [Josh] Hello?

1:25:14.985 --> 1:25:17.112
- Josh, it's Janna Connelly.

1:25:17.153 --> 1:25:18.154
- [Josh] Oh, hey.

1:25:18.196 --> 1:25:19.322
- Come to the Connelly Ranch.

1:25:19.364 --> 1:25:20.824
If I'm right I think
the rest of your story's

1:25:20.866 --> 1:25:21.951
about to be written.

1:25:21.992 --> 1:25:23.786
- [Josh] Okay yeah
I'm in the area I...

1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:27.372
- Great.

1:25:28.582 --> 1:25:31.085
(dramatic music)

1:25:42.345 --> 1:25:44.098
- Shit.

1:25:44.139 --> 1:25:45.307
Shit.

1:26:18.924 --> 1:26:21.593
(low, tense music)

1:26:46.743 --> 1:26:47.536
- Shit.

1:27:20.986 --> 1:27:22.654
- God you're predictable.

1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:27.367
- Looks like you gave
Brock all he could take.

1:27:29.327 --> 1:27:31.955
Doesn't have to be
this way, Ms. Connelly.

1:27:31.997 --> 1:27:34.791
You have no idea what your
ranch is really worth.

1:27:34.833 --> 1:27:37.711
Causality, you're there, just
part of the learning curve,

1:27:37.753 --> 1:27:38.503
that's all.

1:27:41.006 --> 1:27:44.134
Plenty to go around, just
side step the paperwork

1:27:44.176 --> 1:27:45.510
and you're sitting
on a gold mine.

1:27:47.512 --> 1:27:49.556
- Equine herpes virus, huh?

1:27:49.598 --> 1:27:51.016
Clever.

1:27:51.641 --> 1:27:54.352
You got it all figured
out, don't you?

1:27:54.394 --> 1:27:57.147
Hired hand lays the ground
work, gets the horses sick.

1:28:00.192 --> 1:28:02.485
Victoria Morel can accuse
the ranchers of neglect

1:28:02.527 --> 1:28:04.362
and your hands are tied.

1:28:04.404 --> 1:28:06.865
You got no choice but
to take the livestock,

1:28:06.907 --> 1:28:08.075
make a pretty penny of course.

1:28:09.826 --> 1:28:10.994
- I'm gonna need that vial.

1:28:23.757 --> 1:28:24.507
Okay.

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:29.054
- And Hoag Rafferty?

1:28:30.889 --> 1:28:32.474
- Old man's time had come,
is all.

1:28:36.061 --> 1:28:37.520
- That's not the whole
story is it, Sheriff?

1:28:39.148 --> 1:28:41.191
- Not what do you intend
by that, Ms. Connelly?

1:28:43.152 --> 1:28:45.528
- Well, he did your
dirty work for you.

1:28:45.570 --> 1:28:47.363
You had the perfect alibi.

1:28:47.405 --> 1:28:49.241
You witnessed his suicide.

1:28:49.908 --> 1:28:53.287
Horses were sick,
ranch had too much work

1:28:53.328 --> 1:28:56.081
but you handed him
your service weapon.

1:28:56.123 --> 1:28:58.917
You know a jury just might
call that accessory to murder.

1:29:02.963 --> 1:29:06.133
- See now that right there,
those are threatening words,

1:29:06.175 --> 1:29:07.634
Ms. Connelly.

1:29:07.676 --> 1:29:09.636
I came out here hoping
you'd listen to reason.

1:29:11.387 --> 1:29:12.430
Take the plea deal.

1:29:15.892 --> 1:29:18.103
Yeah, I guess we're beyond
that point now, aren't we?

1:29:19.729 --> 1:29:20.647
Your face is bleeding.

1:29:24.567 --> 1:29:25.777
- I'm unarmed, Sheriff.

1:29:25.819 --> 1:29:27.570
- Great.

1:29:27.612 --> 1:29:29.489
- What you're gonna kill me?

1:29:29.531 --> 1:29:32.450
You're gonna kill every
rancher that gets in your way?

1:29:32.492 --> 1:29:34.911
Was it your plan to talk my
dad into killing himself?

1:29:36.121 --> 1:29:36.913
Or was it just Hoag?

1:29:38.748 --> 1:29:41.626
- All right, you know making
this look like self defense

1:29:43.086 --> 1:29:45.214
is a pain and a lot
of paperwork for me

1:29:45.255 --> 1:29:46.923
but that's the way
you wanted to play it.

1:29:50.844 --> 1:29:53.513
- Put the gun down, Sheriff.

1:29:53.555 --> 1:29:55.182
- What the hell you
doing here, Carl?

1:29:56.225 --> 1:29:57.851
- Yeah, uh.

1:29:57.893 --> 1:30:02.564
Found this phone next
to a dead Brock McCarty.

1:30:03.899 --> 1:30:05.108
It's US military.

1:30:06.902 --> 1:30:07.777
- US military.

1:30:09.946 --> 1:30:11.698
Well, that's her phone.

1:30:11.740 --> 1:30:14.951
Looks like you just tied Ms.
Connelly to the murder scene.

1:30:14.993 --> 1:30:16.995
Make the arrest, deputy.

1:30:17.037 --> 1:30:18.621
- This has gone
too far, Sheriff.

1:30:21.875 --> 1:30:23.710
There's another dead
man out there, you know?

1:30:23.752 --> 1:30:24.920
- Self defense, Carl.

1:30:24.961 --> 1:30:25.962
- Yeah, I know it was.

1:30:27.630 --> 1:30:29.341
- Hell we don't know
anything yet, Carl.

1:30:29.383 --> 1:30:31.634
Make the arrest,
deputy, do as I say.

1:30:31.676 --> 1:30:35.680
- No, I'm not doing what you
tell me anymore, Sheriff.

1:30:37.057 --> 1:30:38.016
No, you're under arrest.

1:30:40.143 --> 1:30:41.728
- I'm under arrest?

1:30:41.770 --> 1:30:42.687
Carl.

1:30:44.189 --> 1:30:45.023
You disappoint me.

1:30:53.282 --> 1:30:55.367
(gunshots)

1:30:57.035 --> 1:30:59.704
(horses neighing)

1:31:04.751 --> 1:31:06.836
(groans)

1:31:09.131 --> 1:31:11.007
(gunshot)

1:31:11.049 --> 1:31:13.176
(groaning)

1:31:18.681 --> 1:31:20.474
Carl, you listen to me.

1:31:20.516 --> 1:31:22.060
Don't let your feelings
for Ms. Connelly

1:31:22.102 --> 1:31:23.186
cloud your judgment.

1:31:24.354 --> 1:31:25.814
This has gotten way

1:31:25.855 --> 1:31:27.607
out of control.
- What?

1:31:27.649 --> 1:31:32.446
(heart beating)
(tense music)

1:31:32.486 --> 1:31:34.364
- [Sheriff] I'm sure we
can come up with a solution

1:31:34.406 --> 1:31:36.574
beneficial for both of us.

1:31:36.616 --> 1:31:39.369
You're like a son to me, Carl.

1:31:39.411 --> 1:31:40.829
You hear me, Carl?

1:31:40.870 --> 1:31:41.788
- Carl.

1:31:42.831 --> 1:31:44.082
Carl.

1:31:44.124 --> 1:31:45.499
(groans)

1:31:45.541 --> 1:31:46.876
- Is Carl dead?

1:31:46.918 --> 1:31:48.753
- He needs medical
attention, Sheriff.

1:31:48.795 --> 1:31:49.712
We can't do this here.

1:31:49.754 --> 1:31:51.214
- He knew better.

1:31:51.256 --> 1:31:52.215
He knew his place.

1:31:53.675 --> 1:31:56.803
(tense dramatic music)

1:32:00.015 --> 1:32:01.766
(gunshot)

1:32:01.808 --> 1:32:04.311
Now don't go for his weapon.

1:32:07.189 --> 1:32:09.649
(grunting)

1:32:09.691 --> 1:32:11.609
Let go of me.

1:32:12.152 --> 1:32:15.030
- Janna, get the deputy's gun.

1:32:15.071 --> 1:32:17.991
- (gunshot)
- Fuck.

1:32:18.033 --> 1:32:20.243
(tense dramatic music)

1:32:22.536 --> 1:32:23.997
- I'm gonna fuck you up!

1:32:24.039 --> 1:32:26.249
(gunshot)

1:32:29.085 --> 1:32:30.003
(gunshot)

1:32:31.587 --> 1:32:32.755
- Come on.

1:32:32.797 --> 1:32:34.632
(groaning)

1:32:34.674 --> 1:32:36.176
- Sheriff, drop your weapon.

1:32:38.011 --> 1:32:40.096
(gunfire)

1:32:43.641 --> 1:32:47.979
(horse neighing)

1:32:48.021 --> 1:32:50.273
- Let go.

1:32:50.315 --> 1:32:53.360
(tense dramatic music)

1:33:06.122 --> 1:33:07.374
- Let him go.

1:33:07.416 --> 1:33:08.542
He's out.

1:33:20.929 --> 1:33:23.056
- [Josh] That was
some crazy shit.

1:33:23.098 --> 1:33:24.391
I got it all.

1:33:24.433 --> 1:33:27.227
(tense music)

1:33:27.269 --> 1:33:29.771
(horse neighs)

1:33:31.064 --> 1:33:32.648
- Hey, Carl.

1:33:32.690 --> 1:33:33.649
- [Dell] Janna!

1:33:36.903 --> 1:33:38.530
- Dell, the Sheriff's
in the barn.

1:33:38.572 --> 1:33:40.490
- [Janna] Call an ambulance.

1:33:43.952 --> 1:33:46.662
(horse neighs)

1:33:50.417 --> 1:33:53.836
(soft dramatic music)

1:34:10.770 --> 1:34:13.815
- Can I get you
anything else, Sheriff?

1:34:15.108 --> 1:34:17.486
- Just the door, Daniel, thanks.

1:34:17.527 --> 1:34:18.278
- You got it.

1:34:21.615 --> 1:34:22.616
(door closes)

1:34:26.828 --> 1:34:29.663
- All right,
Matthew Birdie Hudson.

1:34:29.705 --> 1:34:31.416
- How in the hell did
you find that out?

1:34:31.458 --> 1:34:32.875
- Don't matter how I found out.

1:34:34.419 --> 1:34:36.838
Make you foreman

1:34:36.879 --> 1:34:38.214
and you'll take care
of this place

1:34:38.256 --> 1:34:40.842
for me, deal?

1:34:40.883 --> 1:34:42.676
- Yeah, six months without
you bossing me around

1:34:42.718 --> 1:34:44.471
is gonna feel like a vacation.

1:34:44.513 --> 1:34:46.640
- Don't pretend like
you're not gonna miss me.

1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:47.432
- Well, parts.

1:34:54.356 --> 1:34:57.691
- Hey, take care of
my dad, will you?

1:34:57.733 --> 1:34:59.569
- You take care of you.

1:34:59.611 --> 1:35:00.862
Come back in one piece, okay?

1:35:04.032 --> 1:35:05.617
Not that I care.

1:35:05.659 --> 1:35:06.660
(laughing)

1:35:06.700 --> 1:35:07.701
- You're mean.

1:35:09.579 --> 1:35:10.622
Come on, Sugar.

1:35:13.166 --> 1:35:14.750
- Give you some time.

1:35:30.058 --> 1:35:31.560
- "Here lies the one
who loved us all

1:35:33.061 --> 1:35:35.689
and in return the one
who was loved as much.

1:35:35.729 --> 1:35:37.940
No matter how deep your sleep,

1:35:37.982 --> 1:35:39.359
we'll always hear you,
old friend.

1:35:40.776 --> 1:35:43.029
Not even death
will keep your spirit

1:35:43.071 --> 1:35:44.738
from running freely
in my field."

1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:49.827
That's beautiful.

1:35:51.745 --> 1:35:54.624
(soft somber music)

1:35:58.127 --> 1:35:59.295
Here.

1:36:02.924 --> 1:36:04.217
- Oh.

1:36:04.259 --> 1:36:06.344
(laughing)

1:36:08.221 --> 1:36:10.390
Hey, beauty.

1:36:10.432 --> 1:36:12.434
Hey, come here,
I want to show you something.

1:36:16.145 --> 1:36:17.063
This is all yours.

1:36:18.481 --> 1:36:19.649
All yours.

1:36:28.199 --> 1:36:29.158
Welcome back, Sugar.

1:36:32.828 --> 1:36:34.748
(neighing)

1:36:37.166 --> 1:36:40.378
- Although we have had some
setbacks in North Dakota

1:36:40.420 --> 1:36:42.547
we have similar laws in motion.

1:36:42.589 --> 1:36:45.174
South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana.

1:36:45.216 --> 1:36:48.595
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's only a matter of time.

1:36:49.971 --> 1:36:51.222
- [Man] Won't the
situation in North Dakota

1:36:51.264 --> 1:36:52.932
effect our reputation?

1:36:54.934 --> 1:36:57.437
(soft uplifting music)

1:38:50.007 --> 1:38:52.802
- Our story is definitely
movie material.

1:38:52.844 --> 1:38:55.096
I just really hope that
overall, the message gets out

1:38:55.137 --> 1:38:57.973
that this could happen to us
and it could happen to you.

1:38:58.015 --> 1:39:01.895
- If I wouldn't have my
expertise in mental health

1:39:01.935 --> 1:39:05.857
that I do, I really don't think
I would of made it through.

1:39:05.899 --> 1:39:07.734
- Yeah, I don't think, if they
would have taken the animals,

1:39:07.776 --> 1:39:09.402
you wouldn't be sitting
here with me today.

1:39:09.444 --> 1:39:10.361
- No.

1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:12.321
Yeah.

1:39:12.363 --> 1:39:13.989
- Love you.

1:39:14.031 --> 1:39:14.948
- Love you more.
