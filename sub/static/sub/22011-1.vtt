RACHEL: The Second Amendment isn't
just obsolete. It's dangerous.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.762
ANDY: I totally get
why you think that.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.005
I'm sorry, I've just never known
someone who's into guns before.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.684
I'm not into guns, Rachel.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.330
I have a couple.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.685
More than the one.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.683
That doesn't mean
that I'm a fanatic.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.656
Okay, it doesn't mean that
I'm not for restrictions

01:02.680 --> 01:05.126
and waiting periods
and background checks.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.806
(CLEARS THROAT) So what
does it mean, Andy?

01:07.920 --> 01:10.446
I just wanna be
able to protect myself.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.204
From what, exactly?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.970
You googled me.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.451
Yeah, isn't just.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.406
Fucking Internet.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.568
You have a very dark past.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.721
Yeah.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.889
So why didn't you tell me?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.530
Because I like you.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.327
I didn't wanna scare you away.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.571
I was six.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.805
My babysitter was murdered.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.729
(SCREAMS)

01:51.480 --> 01:53.403
Along with my teacher
and my caseworker

01:54.000 --> 01:56.401
and 37 other people
over the years...

01:56.480 --> 01:58.164
That I'm aware of.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.171
And they never caught him?

02:00.920 --> 02:04.083
Put it this way,
justice was done.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.045
CHUCKY: Wait!
Play with this.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.966
(GUNSHOT)

02:09.000 --> 02:10.604
Look, Andy,

02:10.680 --> 02:14.810
I think you're a nice guy, but, uh,
this isn't just too much for me.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.011
(EXHALES SOFTLY)

02:17.080 --> 02:18.366
I get it.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.171
I should go.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.925
(EXHALES SOFTLY) Ah.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.766
(SIGHS)

04:23.320 --> 04:24.560
(GASPS)

04:41.360 --> 04:43.840
I guess it's just me and
you again tonight, pal.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.323
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
(COUGHS)

04:48.440 --> 04:50.169
Give me a hit
off that, will you?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.802
(INHALES SHARPLY)

05:06.760 --> 05:08.046
(GRUNTS) Ah!

05:08.160 --> 05:09.241
(LAUGHS)

05:09.720 --> 05:10.846
You wanna play?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.325
Let's play-

05:20.280 --> 05:21.645
What about Rachel?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.362
Didn't she wanna play?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.682
Now we'll never know
if she's a natural redhead.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.971
(LAUGHS)

05:36.800 --> 05:38.802
Face it, Andy.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.042
I'm all you've got.

05:42.040 --> 05:46.284
Sometimes, it's nice, just
hanging out on a Friday night

05:49.680 --> 05:51.728
with your best friend.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.886
FUCK you!

05:59.120 --> 06:00.884

07:54.720 --> 07:57.121
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(GRUNTING)

07:58.240 --> 07:59.685
I thought you said
she was paralyzed.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.000
She is.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.760
That's just the juice.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.646
(NICA BREATHING HEAVILY)

08:07.200 --> 08:08.247
See?

08:08.320 --> 08:11.130
From the waist down,
she's a pincushion.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.882
All right, that's enough.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.884
<i>NICA: I can still see him</i>

08:25.040 --> 08:26.690
<i>in my nightmares.</i>

08:28.920 --> 08:33.049
<i>His twisted face,
that horrible laugh,</i>

08:33.760 --> 08:38.163
<i>the glint off his blade,
the screams of his victims.</i>

08:38.240 --> 08:40.082
Whose victims, Nica?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.722
The murders were real.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.770
You know that.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.324
But Chucky never was.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.481
That's right.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.770
He was a fantasy.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.286
A delusion.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.160
He was a mask I wore so I could
go on looking in the mirror,

08:57.960 --> 09:00.167
so I could live with myself.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.323
And now, when you look in the
mirror, what do you see?

09:03.400 --> 09:04.925
I don't look.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.609
DR. FOLEY: You'll have to, if you're
ever gonna learn to forgive yourself.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.169
<i>Nica, you've made
tremendous progress.</i>

09:17.560 --> 09:19.289
In the past four years,
you've had to accept

09:20.560 --> 09:22.210
some hard truths about yourself.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.009
That is very brave.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.610
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

09:31.160 --> 09:33.049
I'm having you transferred
to Harrogate.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.287
<i>That's medium security, Nica.</i>

09:38.760 --> 09:44.085
That means more privacy, more
independence, more freedom,

09:44.160 --> 09:45.400
within reason, of course...

09:45.520 --> 09:47.648
Dr. Foley, what I did
was unforgivable.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.807
Schizophrenia is an illness.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.804
By definition,
and according to the law,

09:54.880 --> 09:56.803
you weren't responsible
for your actions.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.280
Do you think Alice
would accept that

09:58.320 --> 10:00.800
as an apology for
making her an orphan?

10:37.320 --> 10:39.084
Are there no cameras?

10:39.360 --> 10:41.328
Not in medium security.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.161
But don't abuse the privilege.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.810
Bathroom's back there.

10:45.880 --> 10:50.363
Shower's handicap-friendly, but if you
need help, ask for Ashley or Pam.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.284
They alternate days.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.249
Anything else, just let me know.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.367
My name's Carlos.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.211
Thanks for being so nice.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.771
Don't misunderstand.
I'm not a fan.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.320
We're not gonna be friends.
I'm just doing my job.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.245
Well, thank you anyway.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.890
You're welcome.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.087
(SNIFFS)

11:21.400 --> 11:23.164
You in an accident?

11:25.560 --> 11:26.721
I was born like this.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.250
My husband has MS.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.566
I'm sorry.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.368
I don't let it keep
him from living his life.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.649
<i>WOMAN: (ON PA) Dr. Foley, your
assistance is needed in room two.</i>

12:05.920 --> 12:08.241
<i>Dr. Foley
to room two, please.</i>

12:47.240 --> 12:48.571
Excuse me.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.160
Can you see me?

12:54.160 --> 12:55.207
Yeah.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.611
Oh, thank God.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.643
None of the others can see me.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.571
Please don't be afraid.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.846
I'm not afraid of you.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.241
Good.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.684
I won't hurt you.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.090
I just need someone to talk to.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.125
I spent my whole life here.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.365
Then I died.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.485
Right here in this room...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.048
A long, long time ago.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.360
That's awful.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.009
Angela, we can all see you.
(SCREAMS)

13:26.080 --> 13:27.161
FUCK you!

13:28.400 --> 13:30.209
(BREATHES RAPIDLY)

13:31.480 --> 13:33.369
Go haunt somebody else now.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.800
(WHIMPERS)

13:35.760 --> 13:37.046
Ah. she's harmless.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.646
They found her living on the
street, like, 30 years ago,

13:39.720 --> 13:41.960
but I guess being dead's more
exotic than being homeless.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.646
I don't know about that.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.411
Well, I've never been dead before,
but I have been homeless,

13:46.480 --> 13:48.926
and it's pretty
fucking colorless.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.487
I'm Michael.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.201
Nica.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.123
Do you wanna, uh...

13:54.200 --> 13:56.202
Yeah.
Yeah?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.448
Where'd you get the gum?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.646
Oh, um, Carlos.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.526
Carlos?

14:08.600 --> 14:09.726
(CHUCKLES) Wow.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.880
You must have made
quite the impression.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.446
Not really.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.761
No, he's kind of
a hard-ass.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.844
But Nurse Ashley,
she's my guardian angel.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.167
Wasn't for her,
I'd still be in detox.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.251
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

14:28.280 --> 14:30.248
So, uh, you just transferred?

14:30.320 --> 14:31.401
Yup.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.125
Where from?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.046
Lochmoor.
Oh.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.565
Oh.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.456
Oh, you're that girl who...

14:41.480 --> 14:42.766
Yeah.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.050
You still have
a thing for redheads?

14:49.440 --> 14:50.441
(LAUGHS) What?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.604
'Cause the...
This, you... No.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.089
Oh. Sorry.
That's too soon.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.288
I'll trade you for a cigarette.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.801
Okay.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.966
Oh.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.441
Juicy Fruit.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.601
Mmm.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.646
Huh.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.530
(PANTING)

15:26.640 --> 15:28.449
(MOANING)

15:32.800 --> 15:34.564
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:38.240 --> 15:39.890
CLAIRE: So Why'd you do it?
Claire.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.480
We're all wondering the
same thing here, right?

15:42.560 --> 15:44.130
Give her a break, okay?
She's new.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.201
Fuck that!

15:45.280 --> 15:46.800
If I'm gonna be
living down the hallway

15:46.840 --> 15:48.416
from someone who butchered
her whole family,

15:48.440 --> 15:49.856
I have a right to
know what set her off.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.136
Well, Why'd you
burn your house down?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.321
You always bring that up.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.336
I'm just saying, if we're
pointing fingers here, then...

15:54.360 --> 15:55.725
I didn't kill anyone.

15:55.800 --> 15:56.881
Neither did Nica.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.321
Chucky did it.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.726
(SCOFFS)

16:07.000 --> 16:10.721
I don't blame you for being
afraid after what I did.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.090
I was very ill.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.246
Are you feeling better now?

16:16.320 --> 16:20.325
I understand your concerns, and,
absolutely, we should talk about it,

16:20.400 --> 16:23.449
but, believe me, Nica isn't
a danger to anyone anymore.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.176
And let's not forget,
she isn't the only one

16:25.200 --> 16:26.770
here to benefit
from an insanity plea.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.645
She's the only multiple
murderer, though.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.610
Mass murderer, actually.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.250
There's a difference.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.561
Who cares?
We're all sick.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.887
I wanna know why
she killed them.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.041
I was pathologically
jealous of my sister,

16:48.880 --> 16:53.169
and I was always too possessive
of Alice, who is my niece.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.485
She's 12 now, and I'll
never see her again.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.402
I only hope she's doing okay.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.561
ANGELA: She's not okay.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.685
Excuse me?

17:14.240 --> 17:15.924
Chucky told me.

17:19.599 --> 17:20.964
Angela.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.769
He called me.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.171
On the phone.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.606
He said to tell you
he's coming for you...

17:30.800 --> 17:32.928
Now that you can have visitors.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.121
(CHUCKLES)

17:37.040 --> 17:38.485
(LAUGHS)

17:49.640 --> 17:51.290
You think this is funny?

17:54.600 --> 17:55.726
No.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.286
I don't.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.929
It's okay, Angie.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.045
It's okay.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.406
Okay, it was inevitable
that this would come up.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.484
And it's important that we all
explore it together as a group.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.405
I think I have
something that will help.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.607
<i>(IN</i> GOOD <i>GUY VOICE)
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?</i>

18:31.880 --> 18:32.927
Whoa!

18:33.000 --> 18:34.525
Is that a...
It's just a Good Guy doll,

18:34.600 --> 18:36.568
one of thousands
made back in the '80s.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.766
No, he said, "Chucky"!

18:37.840 --> 18:40.411
They had 50 different names. Two
percent of them were "Chucky."

18:40.480 --> 18:41.656
You're saying
it's a coincidence?

18:41.680 --> 18:43.648
Not at all.
I paid for a Chucky.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.286
Where'd you get it?

18:45.800 --> 18:46.847
Hot Topic.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.441
Nica, this doesn't make you
uncomfortable, does it?

18:51.520 --> 18:53.170
No, not at all.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.805
Oh, my God.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.169
What is it, Madeleine?

19:05.640 --> 19:07.130
He's my baby.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.361
(WHISPERS) on.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.609
Open up, sweetheart.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.562
Here comes
the choo-choo.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.283
It's too hot for him.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.964
<i>I like to be hugged.</i>

19:41.040 --> 19:43.441
I can't believe
he's talking already!

19:43.520 --> 19:44.681
Madeleine, stop it!

19:45.840 --> 19:48.320
Your baby is dead.
You know that.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.496
What is your problem? Why can't
you just let her be happy?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.136
You think that's
the way to make her happy?

19:52.160 --> 19:54.360
Letting her play house with
some psycho killer's trophy?

19:54.560 --> 19:55.561
(GASPS)

19:55.640 --> 19:57.051
Give him back.
"Him"?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.168
That's an interesting
choice of pronoun.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.163
Are you still having
trouble separating reality

20:01.240 --> 20:02.526
from that sick
shit in your head?

20:02.600 --> 20:03.681
No.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.491
Unfortunately, these days,
reality is painfully clear.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.011
Now give him back.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.605
What are you gonna do, Nica?

20:09.680 --> 20:12.160
You gonna stab me?
Cut my throat?

20:12.240 --> 20:13.526
Chop off my head?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.125
NICA: Don't be ridiculous.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.362
We don't even have
access to real cutlery.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.522
The only thing I
could get my hands on

20:19.600 --> 20:21.056
are the barbiturates they
give me every morning

20:21.080 --> 20:22.923
that I've been
stockpiling for months,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.526
waiting for the right bitch
to come along to poison.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.761
Here.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.487
Thank you.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.371
Sure.
Are you okay, Chucky?

20:41.960 --> 20:43.371
I'm Mark, by the way.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.400
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.121
What?

20:49.720 --> 20:50.721
From Michael.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.689
He's in the pool right now,
getting ready for Tokyo in 2020,

20:55.760 --> 20:57.250
but don't tell anyone.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.245
Michael Phelps?

21:00.120 --> 21:01.485
He's retired.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.845
Oh. Oh.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.765
God, this is embarrassing.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.136
I fucking hate it
when this happens,

21:08.160 --> 21:09.296
especially around a pretty girl.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.561
It's actually
one of my triggers.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.608
His real name is Malcolm.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.250
We call him Multiple Malcolm.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.084
Nobody calls me that.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.766
(EXHALES)

21:25.960 --> 21:26.960
Excuse me.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.480
Nica, you have a visitor.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.686
Nica, this is Ms. Valentine,
your niece's legal guardian.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.209
You're Alice's guardian?

22:02.960 --> 22:04.405
That's right.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.805
I'm sorry,
but you seem really familiar.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.926
Did anyone ever tell you, you
look exactly like Jennifer Tilly?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.968
Yeah, I get that a lot.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.768
You're not quite what
I expected, either.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.925
What did you expect?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.764
Somebody taller.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.411
You don't seem very dangerous.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.169
You don't seem very motherly.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.326
Huh.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.726
How is she?

22:35.080 --> 22:36.809
She's dead, Miss Pierce.

22:41.480 --> 22:42.606
What?

22:42.840 --> 22:44.320
Ms. Valentine,
I wish you had told me.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.406
Oh, didn't I?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.760
(VOICE BREAKING)
Uh, I'm terribly sorry.

22:48.800 --> 22:52.088
I've just been going
through an awful ordeal.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.600
(SNIFFLES AND SOBS)

22:56.280 --> 23:00.444
But she's in a better
place now, I know it.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.846
What happened?

23:03.920 --> 23:10.246
I'm no doctor, Miss Pierce, but
I think it was a broken heart.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.691
(INHALES SHARPLY)

23:13.880 --> 23:15.120

23:29.800 --> 23:31.928
That's not the same...
No, no.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.004
This is the doll that they
used in Alice's therapy.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.560
To help her get over the past.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.201
She thought that maybe
it would help you, too.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.122
There you go.
(WHIMPERS)

23:45.080 --> 23:46.081

I'm not.

something to you.

I am a vintage, mass-marketed

talked to last night on the phone?

I hear things, too.

I washed her hair.
I wiped her ass.

Not necessarily.

Because he's fucking with me.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.769
That's what he does.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.248
First, he'll kill
each and every one of you

ways you can imagine.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.328

Unless, of course,
I'm a complete psychopath.

58:12.960 --> 58:14.564
Madeleine, what have you done?

58:16.920 --> 58:17.921
What?

58:18.000 --> 58:20.480
What have you done
to your baby, Madeleine?

58:21.400 --> 58:23.528
It's not a baby,
it's just a doll.

58:24.520 --> 58:25.851
Your baby.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.086
Joshua.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.000
Remember?

58:31.760 --> 58:34.206
What did you do
to him, Madeleine?

58:36.840 --> 58:37.921
Say it.

58:41.120 --> 58:42.451
I'm sorry.

58:43.440 --> 58:45.408
I'm so, so sorry.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.289
Not to me, Madeleine.

58:47.760 --> 58:49.125
Say it to him.

59:00.920 --> 59:03.730
My sweet angel,
can you ever forgive me?

59:12.520 --> 59:14.602
(VOICE BREAKS) He just
wouldn't stop crying.

59:15.440 --> 59:18.523
No matter what I did,
I couldn't make him stop.

59:18.600 --> 59:22.650
The sound was like a sharp piece
of glass drilling into my head.

59:24.600 --> 59:26.489
I was a terrible mother.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.321
I could never make him happy.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.606
You didn't kill him.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.921
What?
Nica, please.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.365
He's just pretending.

59:35.320 --> 59:37.322
Leave him alone!
He's alive!

59:37.920 --> 59:39.160
<i>I like to be hugged.</i>

59:39.360 --> 59:40.486
(LAUGHS)

59:43.320 --> 59:45.800
More than anything,
I wish that he was.

59:47.840 --> 59:50.286
Wishing won't bring him back.
I know that now.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.571
Come on.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.560
(SOBS)

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.367
It's a doll.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.204
And it's a powerful symbol of
your guilt, Malcolm's confusion,

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.966
(SCOFFS)
and the past.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.888
Now, don't you think it's time to
bury the past once and for all?

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.802
In sure and certain hope of the
resurrection unto eternal life

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.247
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.881
we commend unto Almighty God
our loved ones,

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.167
and we commit their
bodies to the ground.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.885
Earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.607
May the Lord bless
them and keep them

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.927
and shine His light
down upon them

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.249
and be gracious unto them
and give them peace.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.686
Amen.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.241
CARLOS: You're not
buying it, are you?

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.961
Nope.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.931
He'll be back.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.529
He always comes back.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.371
Visiting hours are over, sir.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.647
Gonna have to ask
you to turn around.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.048
I need to see Dr. Foley,
or Nica Pierce, right away.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.416
Well, you can call
and make an appointment.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.726
No, this is an emergency.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.041
I bet, but now, please,
just get back in your car

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.202
and turn it around, all right?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.805
Okay, then I wanna
commit myself.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.524
Get the hell out of here!
Right now!

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.601
(GRUNTS)

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.521

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.646
Night-night.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.889
This just came for you,
Dr. Foley.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.041
Who's it from?

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.201
Doesn't say.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.243
What happened to his hair?

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.567
(EXHALES) Why would
anyone send this to me?

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.363
You know, we've got way more important
things to worry about right now.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.680
Let's get on our rounds.
Yeah.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.765
(WHIMPERS)

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.724
(SOBBING)

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.170
No shoelaces.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.288
It's all I have left of him.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.921
Dr. Foley put you
on suicide watch.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.527
You know, I'd do it if I
thought I could see him again.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.168
But suicides don't
go to heaven, do they?

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.408
I don't know, Madeleine.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.007
I just know I have
two children of my own,

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.606
and I'd do anything
to keep them safe.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.049
Would you kill for them
if it was for their own good?

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.687
Do you love them that much?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.600
<i>WOMAN: (ON PA) Nurse Ashley, please
report to the nurses' station.</i>

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.410
I'll be checking on
you every 15 minutes.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.690
(LAUGHING)

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.760
Hi, baby.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.165
They just don't get us.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.851
And they never will.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.287
A mother's love never dies.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.406
Not even when she kills it.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.370
Now, please,

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.249
one last time,

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.285
come to Mommy.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.041
Will it hurt?

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.444
I'll do my best.

Well, you're having a bad day,
aren't you, Doc?

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.323
Ashley, put him to bed.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.680
(SIGHS)

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.883
(VOICE BREAKS) Dr. Foley, I don't
think I can do this anymore.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.522
What?
It's too much.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.371
I'm sorry.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.046
(CHUCKLES)

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.363
DR. FOLEY:
Go to bed, Malcolm.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.361
Sure.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:50.805
Get rid of it.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.880
Yes, sir.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:26.526
Nica?

01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:42.282
How did you get in here?

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.410
Take a fucking guess.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.689
DR. FOLEY: If this is a joke,
this is not a good day for it.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.609
It was Chucky.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.491
(LAUGHS)

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.245
Why do I always fall
for the crazy ones?

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.721
Madeleine's dead.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.961
Chucky did it.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.405
No.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.209
She killed herself.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.922
She dug him up and
mutilated herself

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.242
so it looked like Chucky did it.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.367
No.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.647
Unless you
killed them all, Nica.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.121
You know, it doesn't
really matter to me

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.851
because, either way, it's
gonna make a hell of a book.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.922
But now, you're gonna
have to go back to Lochmoor.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.723
It's too bad, because here,
I could've given you

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.891
so much more personal attention.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.962
He's gonna kill you, too.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.606

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.800
You're gonna die,

and I'm gonna tell
everybody about you.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.890
You're a diagnosed schizophrenic

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.289
and a murderess of five
people, that we know of.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.121

I just can't with this guy!

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.844
I don't know whether to kill
him or just take notes.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.921
(LAUGHING)

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.127
Now, we're gonna try this again.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.371
I'm not a killer.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.564
Not yet.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.250
Oh, my God.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.451
He's here.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.405
Took him long enough.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.641
Stupid kid.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.722
Andy's not a kid anymore.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.040
So what's your point?

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.521
I'm just saying, it behooves
us to watch our step.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.641
"Behooves." Listen to you.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.087
You sound like Hannibal Lecter.

Can't believe they
canceled that show.

You know, I love being me.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.003
And I love my job.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.368
Especially the look
on my victim's face

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.205
when they realize,
in that final moment,

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.721
that it's all really happening.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.010
A children's toy is actually beating
them to death with a yardstick!

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.411
Or setting them on fire.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.686

It was fun for a while.

If I wanted you dead,
you'd be tits-up by now.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.569
I was never
gonna kill you, Nica.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.370

worse things than death.

she never wakes up.

I'm not Michael. I'm...
