asked me?

that's a wise decision?

answering 'cause it's you.

11:48.538 --> 11:49.830
Just go!!

11:57.177 --> 11:58.638
Why won't
this thing work?

11:58.638 --> 12:00.340
Let me try.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.262
I'm a bit of a techy.

12:02.262 --> 12:03.894
( grunts )

12:06.146 --> 12:07.647
That's all I got.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.812
Just call the team.

12:11.812 --> 12:14.614
I'm sure they already left.
I can't slow them down.

12:14.614 --> 12:16.777
Too bad we can't get to
the underground tunnels

12:16.777 --> 12:18.568
behind these rock walls.

12:18.568 --> 12:20.781
They should connect
directly to the mission site.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.243
Wait. There are tunnels
behind here?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.455
Yep. They go all over
the city.

12:25.455 --> 12:27.037
That's how I got in here.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.578
But now they're locked
because earlier,

12:28.578 --> 12:30.540
some nitwit
shot the controls.

12:33.633 --> 12:36.086
Wow!

12:36.086 --> 12:38.048
And I thought
my Uncle Cletus was cool

12:38.048 --> 12:39.639
when he popped
his belly button in and out

12:39.639 --> 12:42.092
to "Yankee Doodle."

12:42.092 --> 12:44.684
Well, till he pushed too hard
and his insides shot out

12:44.684 --> 12:46.686
like a snake in a can.

12:50.690 --> 12:53.523
Starting to wonder if
we should really be friends.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.403
Okay, that's everyone.

13:03.403 --> 13:05.205
Great work, team.

13:05.205 --> 13:07.747
We got everybody out
in a safe and timely fashion.

13:07.747 --> 13:09.960
And while that should be
reward enough,

13:09.960 --> 13:11.872
let me throw this little
cherry on top.

13:11.872 --> 13:13.543
Thank you.

13:15.876 --> 13:18.919
- No worries.
- Cool.
- That's it?

13:18.919 --> 13:21.681
No "Thank you, Chase,
for your brilliant leadership"?

13:21.681 --> 13:24.925
- You're the best.
- Thank you very much.

13:24.925 --> 13:27.888
Hey, Chase is
a great leader.

13:27.888 --> 13:30.931
- Okay, he's worked
long and hard at it.
- Thank you, Bree.

13:30.931 --> 13:32.933
It's not his fault that
Skylar just rolled out of bed

13:32.933 --> 13:34.564
and became a great one
immediately.

13:36.736 --> 13:38.528
Okay, you know what?

13:38.528 --> 13:40.400
I'm taking back my cherry.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.701
( loud rumbling )

13:41.701 --> 13:43.533
The ceiling's cracking.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.705
This whole place
is gonna come down.

13:45.705 --> 13:47.537
We have to get
outta here!

13:47.537 --> 13:49.329
- Wait.
- ( footsteps echoing )

13:49.329 --> 13:51.621
There's still people
in there.

13:51.621 --> 13:53.713
I'll get them.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.839
Skylar?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.382
How did you get out...

14:02.382 --> 14:04.014
I mean...

14:04.014 --> 14:06.346
Where were you?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.229
We were stuck in
mission command.

14:09.229 --> 14:11.601
We had to escape through
the underground tunnels.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.233
Well, what's she
doing here?

14:13.233 --> 14:16.186
Skylar and I are besties now.
Deal with it.

14:16.186 --> 14:18.608
( creaking )

14:20.280 --> 14:22.152
The tunnel's
coming down!

14:36.376 --> 14:38.258
Don't worry.
I'll blast us out.

14:38.258 --> 14:40.710
No. It isn't stable.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.803
The only thing preventing
this tunnel from collapsing
is this pile.

14:43.803 --> 14:46.806
Blasting us out
is a terrible idea...

14:46.806 --> 14:48.348
mission leader.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.642
What do you suggest?

14:52.642 --> 14:53.974
I'll put my force field
around us.

14:53.974 --> 14:55.815
That'll protect us
if it collapses.

14:55.815 --> 14:58.608
And leave us trapped underneath
an even bigger pile of rubble

14:58.608 --> 15:01.151
not to mention crushing
the rest of the team.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.823
Stop arguing and focus
on what's important.

15:03.823 --> 15:05.785
Saving me.

15:07.737 --> 15:09.619
Don't worry, we're all
gonna get out of here.

15:09.619 --> 15:12.292
Give her false hope.
That's a great solution.

15:12.292 --> 15:14.034
It's not hope.

15:14.034 --> 15:16.206
I trust our team,
and I know they'll rescue us.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.999
- How?
- They're smart.
They'll figure it out.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.670
No, they aren't.
No, they won't.

15:23.093 --> 15:25.885
Can you guys hear me?

15:25.885 --> 15:27.467
We have to get them
outta there.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.809
How? The people that tell us
how to do that

15:29.809 --> 15:31.011
are both in there.

15:31.011 --> 15:33.683
We are an elite force.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.315
We can figure it out
ourselves.

15:35.315 --> 15:37.267
Right. We just
have to think.

15:37.267 --> 15:39.479
What would Chase
or Skylar do?

15:39.479 --> 15:43.443
Well, I know one of them
would be beautiful.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.906
I'm starting to wish that
you were stuck in there, too.

15:46.906 --> 15:50.030
You know, with Skylar,
I'll take it.

15:52.282 --> 15:54.074
I feel horrible, Chase.

15:54.074 --> 15:55.875
You wouldn't even be stuck here
if you weren't trying

15:55.875 --> 15:58.458
- to save our lives.
- Don't feel that bad.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.460
He's the one that locked you
in mission command.

16:01.881 --> 16:03.583
What?!

16:03.583 --> 16:05.295
What is she
talking about?

16:05.295 --> 16:08.718
Yeah. What are you
talking about?

16:08.718 --> 16:09.929
You purposely locked her in

16:09.929 --> 16:11.801
so that you could
go on a mission

16:11.801 --> 16:14.054
without her
and be leader again.

16:14.054 --> 16:15.395
Is that true?

16:15.395 --> 16:17.977
Come on, you're gonna believe
a chronic liar?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.939
I resent you calling me
a chronic liar,

16:19.939 --> 16:22.312
and so would my nephew
Abraham Lincoln.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.906
I'm gonna ask you
one last time, Chase.

16:26.906 --> 16:28.778
Is it true?

16:32.112 --> 16:34.784
Yes, it's true.

16:34.784 --> 16:36.576
What, did you watch
the security footage?

16:36.576 --> 16:38.878
Nah. I just thought,
what would I do if I was Chase,

16:38.878 --> 16:41.081
and was threatened by
an amazing,

16:41.081 --> 16:43.173
vastly superior superhero?

16:43.173 --> 16:45.255
Guess we're not
that different after all.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.626
You really could
be my son.

16:49.589 --> 16:52.052
We're running out of time.
We have to figure out a way

16:52.052 --> 16:53.893
to remove one of
those giant rocks

16:53.893 --> 16:54.894
so they can climb through.

16:54.894 --> 16:56.766
But if we remove
the wrong one,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.938
the entire tunnel
will collapse.

16:58.938 --> 17:00.690
Wait a second.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.852
This is just like
your Topple the Tower game.

17:02.852 --> 17:07.737
Yeah, except when we play,
almost no one dies.

17:07.737 --> 17:10.780
Okay, but with all of
your experience,

17:10.780 --> 17:12.952
you should have an advantage
at picking the right rock.

17:12.952 --> 17:15.825
You're right.
This can work.
That's genius, Bree.

17:15.825 --> 17:19.209
Genius? I told you
to move a rock.
Settle down.

17:20.660 --> 17:23.002
No, not that one.
The one next to it.

17:23.002 --> 17:25.835
Oliver, I am
a pro at this.

17:25.835 --> 17:27.337
I'm pretty sure
it's that one.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.838
Okay.

17:31.131 --> 17:32.842
Put it back,
put it back, put it back!

17:35.675 --> 17:37.557
Look.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.809
I'm sorry, okay?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.771
I was afraid you were
gonna take my job.

17:41.771 --> 17:43.893
I told you,

17:43.893 --> 17:45.735
the only reason why
I stepped in

17:45.735 --> 17:47.107
was because the team
needed me.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.988
I never wanted to be
mission leader.

17:48.988 --> 17:52.152
Yeah, but you could be.

17:52.152 --> 17:53.953
You're really good at it.

17:55.245 --> 17:57.787
When I saw how
the team responded to you,

17:57.787 --> 18:01.201
I... I just panicked.

18:01.201 --> 18:04.704
It's just
a title, Chase.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.706
No. Not to me.

18:06.706 --> 18:09.709
Without that title,
I don't know who I am.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.551
I can tell you
who you are,

18:11.551 --> 18:13.473
but you're not
gonna like it.

18:13.473 --> 18:15.805
It doesn't matter anyway.

18:15.805 --> 18:17.847
We're either gonna die in here,

18:17.847 --> 18:19.889
or if we do somehow
manage to get out,

18:19.889 --> 18:22.642
everyone is gonna find out
what I did, and they'll

18:22.642 --> 18:25.024
never respect me enough
to be mission leader again.

18:25.024 --> 18:28.778
Either way,
it's over for me.

18:32.532 --> 18:35.114
- Glen!
- Uh, no,
it's Paul actually.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.197
Oliver's Glen.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.291
Yes! I knew you guys
could do it.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.503
Really? 'Cause there was
all sorts of self-doubt

18:43.503 --> 18:45.295
happening on this end.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.961
Perry was amazing
in the tunnels.

18:51.961 --> 18:53.803
There were tons of rats
down there,

18:53.803 --> 18:55.515
but when they saw her coming,
they just scattered.

18:55.515 --> 18:58.428
Yeah, she frightens
most living things.

19:00.019 --> 19:01.391
Hey, you never said
how you got stuck

19:01.391 --> 19:02.762
in mission command.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.976
Uh, I don't know.

19:06.976 --> 19:09.939
I guess the hyperlift
just broke.

19:09.939 --> 19:13.483
- Again?
- Yeah. We really need
to get that fixed.

19:16.035 --> 19:18.117
You just got lucky.

19:18.117 --> 19:20.950
If Skylar won't snitch,
your secret's safe with me.

19:20.950 --> 19:22.912
For now.

19:27.957 --> 19:30.880
Hey, why didn't you
say anything?

19:30.880 --> 19:33.172
Because I get it.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.505
When I lost my powers,

19:35.505 --> 19:37.257
I lost my identity.

19:37.257 --> 19:39.929
I wouldn't wish
that feeling on anyone.

19:39.929 --> 19:40.970
Thank you.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.474
All right, let's
get outta here.

19:46.356 --> 19:47.807
Hey.

19:47.807 --> 19:49.269
You know what?

19:49.269 --> 19:51.611
We're two for two
on missions.

19:51.611 --> 19:53.022
You know what that
calls for.

19:53.022 --> 19:54.864
( rock music plays )

19:54.864 --> 19:56.526
I said no!

20:05.084 --> 20:06.916
Hey, so what did you guys
think of your first missions?

20:06.916 --> 20:09.088
I was just happy
to be out there again.

20:09.088 --> 20:10.460
Being a hero is what
I was born to do.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.792
And what I was implanted
with a chip

20:12.792 --> 20:15.134
by an egotistical
millionaire to do.

20:15.134 --> 20:18.298
We just touched
a space rock.

20:18.298 --> 20:20.970
BOTH: Superheroes.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.604
Everyone, I have
an announcement to make.

20:24.604 --> 20:27.106
I've decided to take on
a new role.

20:27.106 --> 20:28.438
Team member.

20:28.438 --> 20:30.270
Awesome.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.941
- Now Bree can be leader.
- Oh, yeah.

20:31.941 --> 20:34.524
Or Kaz. Or me.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.855
No one's gonna be leader!

20:37.657 --> 20:39.949
Because...

20:39.949 --> 20:42.702
any one of us can step up
and take control when needed.

20:42.702 --> 20:44.284
You all proved that today.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.166
Wow, Chase,
I'm really impressed.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.080
Scooch!

20:52.332 --> 20:54.714
Why are you still here?

20:54.714 --> 20:56.966
I'm gonna let Chase
answer that.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.642
Uh, I told Perry

21:02.642 --> 21:04.304
that I wanted her to stay.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.645
What?

21:07.186 --> 21:10.019
Yeah, um, by helping
Skylar through the tunnels,

21:10.019 --> 21:13.152
she proved that she could
be a valuable support member

21:13.152 --> 21:16.776
for the team, so
I talked to Mr. Davenport,

21:16.776 --> 21:19.028
and he set her up
with an apartment.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.902
Right next door.

21:29.409 --> 21:30.870
What are you doing?

21:30.870 --> 21:33.543
My pad ain't gonna
furnish itself.
