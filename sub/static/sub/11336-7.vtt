00:02.169 --> 00:03.435
Dad, please, you don't have...

00:03.437 --> 00:06.405
(loud clattering)

00:06.407 --> 00:07.506
Go on.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.741
You say one more word.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.442
Just one.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.478
(chair scrapes on floor)

00:12.480 --> 00:15.180
Okay, if this is
what you want...

00:20.588 --> 00:22.888
WOMAN:
911.

00:22.889 --> 00:25.189
(whispering): I work for the
Strachan family in Rosedale.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.492
They have a son.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.327
He's going to kill Mr. Strachan.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.495
He's got a gun.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.763
(gunshot)

00:30.765 --> 00:33.632
Oh, my God, Rolland,
what have we done?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.736
ED (over speaker):
This is the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.671
Everyone in the
Strachan house needs

00:39.673 --> 00:41.473
to stay where they are.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.446
Clear on your count.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.515
Three, two, one.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.350
(loud bang)

00:51.352 --> 00:53.652
Three, two, one.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.556
(banging)

01:16.710 --> 01:18.177
Comfy there, Samo?

01:19.146 --> 01:20.813
I'm very comfortable, sir.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.698
Get you some more coffee?

01:22.699 --> 01:24.582
All good, sir,
but thank you for asking.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.185
What are you doing
here, anyway?

01:26.187 --> 01:28.087
'Cause you just had
to bring it up?

01:28.089 --> 01:29.822
SAM:
Well, Constable Callaghan,

01:29.824 --> 01:32.424
that would be
because yesterday I got...

01:32.426 --> 01:33.859
ALL:
Tightest grouping
at both long range

01:33.861 --> 01:36.295
and short range
firearm practice.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.363
Meaning you get
to do monthly cleanup,

01:38.365 --> 01:40.099
and I get to do this.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.366
Missed a spot there, Ed.

01:41.368 --> 01:42.634
Yeah, whatever.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.136
JULES:
Actually, what I meant

01:44.138 --> 01:45.504
is, why are you down here?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.156
Why aren't you upstairs

01:47.157 --> 01:48.807
training, you
know, at something

01:48.809 --> 01:50.509
dangerous and exciting?

01:53.147 --> 01:55.147
Sam, everything okay?

01:56.117 --> 01:57.850
Yeah, I... I just gotta go
do something.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.150
¶ ¶

03:00.915 --> 03:04.183
¶ ¶

03:11.559 --> 03:13.825
Wake up, boy.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.528
RJ?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.930
Shh, shh, shh.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.365
(phone ringing on line)

03:20.367 --> 03:21.767
MAN (on phone):
Hello?

03:21.769 --> 03:23.869
Jay, it's Braddock.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.938
Sam, the hell time is it?

03:25.940 --> 03:27.839
0600, soldier.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.708
You out of Special Forces now
or what?

03:29.710 --> 03:30.943
No, no, uh...

03:30.945 --> 03:32.411
in-between tours.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.880
Back to the sand in a week. You?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.382
Police force.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.883
Got tired of working
for a living, huh?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.252
Yeah, I guess.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.988
So, Dave Haverlik... you hear?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.391
(sighs)

03:46.393 --> 03:48.560
Anyways, figure I'll go up
on the highway tonight.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.661
You will?

03:49.663 --> 03:50.896
Died in the field, didn't he?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.298
He wasn't in the field;
he was at camp.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.533
They hit the camp?

03:54.535 --> 03:55.534
Come on, man.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.935
You gonna make me say it?

03:56.937 --> 03:58.971
All right, Chris Geordie
found him.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.739
Own sidearm and everything.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.842
I just know
I ain't going up there.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.978
Just like we said, right?

04:06.947 --> 04:09.281
Right.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.953
What are you
talking about?

04:14.955 --> 04:16.021
Where up north?

04:16.023 --> 04:18.523
It's a surprise.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.993
What are you so up about?

04:20.995 --> 04:22.327
What do you have in there?

04:22.329 --> 04:24.730
Uh, you know,
a little fun and games.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.665
I guess it's me that gets
to tell them your travel plans.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.433
No, man.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.569
Why do you think I'm here?

04:30.571 --> 04:32.738
I'm getting you out of here.
You're coming with me.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.040
Where, up north?

04:35.041 --> 04:36.374
Why... why would I want
to do that?

04:39.546 --> 04:41.013
Are you serious?

04:42.383 --> 04:43.782
Don't forget your bank card.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.850
The units canceled mine.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.285
Dude, no.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.719
I just got
my acceptance letters.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.289
U of T, McGill, Yale...

04:50.291 --> 04:51.841
Yale?

04:51.842 --> 04:53.392
Wow, what, you get
into Harvard, too?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.860
No.
Dummy.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.629
Yeah, 'cause nothing
says "scholastic achievement"

04:57.631 --> 05:00.699
like the Baden-Highsmith
Military Academy for Young Men.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.568
Yeah, well, BH and I decided

05:03.570 --> 05:06.405
to reassess our educational
relationship yesterday.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.906
You had one
year, RJ.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.975
One year,
and you were home free.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.777
Have to toughen you up,
obviously.

05:11.779 --> 05:12.978
So, you gonna do what
your big brother says?

05:12.980 --> 05:13.979
You gonna come
with me?
No.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.847
No? Oh, okay, well, sure.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.633
That's the way
you feel,

05:17.634 --> 05:19.418
but why are you hitting
yourself there, buddy?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.619
It's okay,
don't beat yourself up.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.620
Rolland?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.555
What are you
doing here?

05:25.359 --> 05:26.458
Hey, Ma.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.959
RJ, you can't be here.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.494
He doesn't know.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.629
I don't care.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.763
MR. STRACHAN:
Hilary?

05:31.765 --> 05:34.900
What are you
doing out there?

05:34.902 --> 05:37.469
Well, he's up now.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.072
Margarite will set you a place
for breakfast.

05:40.074 --> 05:43.342
I'm not sitting down
with you and him for breakfast.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.378
There's no way.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.936
So, uh, maybe later

05:53.937 --> 05:55.520
we can all go for a walk
in the ravine.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.389
I mean, we haven't done that
in forever.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.523
Or maybe we could...

05:58.525 --> 06:00.092
Why, I'm fine, Dad.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.727
And how are you?

06:01.729 --> 06:04.363
Could we please not
do this, just once?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.597
MR. STRACHAN:
What I am doing

06:05.599 --> 06:07.999
is exerting every ounce
of self-control I have

06:08.001 --> 06:09.534
not to ask
the obvious question.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.837
Oh, well, the
answer is, uh, no.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.106
Your tie doesn't make
your ass look fat.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.409
You idiot.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.044
This is what I mean.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.547
You contemptible, ungrateful,
stupid, vicious idiot.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.082
(laughs)
Oh, it's funny, is it?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.484
Yeah.
You think it's funny?

06:25.486 --> 06:26.852
Well, then, laugh at this.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.553
$36,000.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.422
Fully taxable,
non-refundable.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.623
$36,000

06:31.625 --> 06:33.125
we spent to send you
to that place,

06:33.127 --> 06:34.559
and if you think you are

06:34.561 --> 06:37.095
gonna drop out, then you
will pay us back

06:37.097 --> 06:39.131
every single penny,
do you understand?

06:39.133 --> 06:40.899
(laughing)

06:40.901 --> 06:43.101
(loud clattering)

06:43.103 --> 06:44.836
Do you understand?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.605
(sniffs)
No.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.440
No, you don't understand?

06:48.442 --> 06:50.142
Even you can't be that stupid.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.943
No, I'm not gonna
pay you back

06:51.945 --> 06:53.578
because I never
wanted to go there.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.081
MRS. STRACHAN:
Rolland, where else
could you go?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.183
They were going
to press charges for the fire...

06:58.185 --> 07:00.118
So, then, let them
press charges.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.053
Or don't.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.190
Protect the precious
Strachan family name.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.625
Do what you feel.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.527
Send me a postcard.
I'll be in the Yukon.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.462
MRS. STRACHAN:
Who do we know in the Yukon?

07:10.464 --> 07:11.496
Oh, Hilary, shut up.

07:11.498 --> 07:12.998
Simon's coming with me.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.466
He's the only reason
I'm still here.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.834
Right, Simon?

07:15.836 --> 07:17.602
MR. STRACHAN:
No.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.937
Simon is going to a real school.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.840
Simon is going to do
what's expected of him.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.842
Because he is not
a liar and a stupid fool

07:23.844 --> 07:25.610
and a coward.
Dad, please,
you don't have to...

07:25.612 --> 07:27.446
(loud clattering)

07:27.448 --> 07:28.213
Go on.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.081
You say
one more word.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.616
Just one.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.832
Okay, if this
is what you want...

07:46.834 --> 07:48.633
here it is.

07:50.804 --> 07:55.006
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:27.941 --> 08:29.808
RJ, look at me.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.042
You think I
won't do this.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.812
You don't think I'll do this?!

08:33.814 --> 08:36.081
If you had the guts,
I might be afraid.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.148
SIMON:
RJ.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.283
RJ, look at me.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.519
RJ!

08:40.521 --> 08:42.053
You are so far in
over your head.

08:42.055 --> 08:45.023
You have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.931
WOMAN:
911.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.932
(whispering): I work for the
Strachan family in Rosedale.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.601
They have a son.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.136
He's going to kill Mr. Strachan.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.938
He's got a gun.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.072
Hurry.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.983
Hey.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.985
So, I saw the paper.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.054
Is that guy
from your team?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.256
Brave guys.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.860
Did I miss something?

09:21.862 --> 09:24.763
He wasn't brave.
He did it himself.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.698
(sighs)

09:26.700 --> 09:28.066
I'm sorry.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.870
Were you close?

09:31.871 --> 09:33.905
Spend enough time,
think you know someone...

09:33.907 --> 09:35.941
And you had no idea, huh?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.678
Sam, I'm just trying to help.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.915
So, you gonna go
to the highway

09:43.917 --> 09:44.983
and watch the procession?

09:44.985 --> 09:46.952
No.
No?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.353
Don't you usually go?

09:49.590 --> 09:51.656
On our team, the only
thing protecting you

09:51.658 --> 09:54.025
is each other, so
we made a deal.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.760
You give up like that,

09:55.762 --> 09:57.963
you don't mean anything
to us anymore.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.798
(alarm sounding)

09:59.800 --> 10:01.967
KIRA (over intercom):
Team One, Team One,
hot call, gear up!

10:01.969 --> 10:04.035
Sam, if you want
to talk after...

10:04.037 --> 10:05.804
Take your truck?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.706
Absolutely.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.874
(alarm continues)

10:15.682 --> 10:17.015
PARKER:
<i>Team leader, talk back.</i>

10:17.017 --> 10:18.783
ED:
<i> Go ahead, boss.</i>

10:18.785 --> 10:20.352
<i>Stealth approach,</i>
<i>low profile.</i>

10:20.354 --> 10:22.087
<i>Absolutely no noise,</i>
<i>you copy?</i>

10:22.089 --> 10:25.056
<i> We copy, boss.</i>

10:26.026 --> 10:27.025
Okay, RJ.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.643
Okay, it's you and me.

10:28.644 --> 10:30.260
We can work
this out together.
Yeah, how?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.630
Yeah, Simon, please, come on,

10:31.632 --> 10:33.448
tell us all how.
SIMON:
Okay, RJ.

10:33.449 --> 10:35.265
You're gonna give me the gun,
we're gonna put it back,

10:35.268 --> 10:37.002
and then you're
going back to BH.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.303
No, I can't go back.
It's only

10:38.305 --> 10:40.005
for a few more months,
you can handle it.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.307
No, I mean, I can't
go back-- ask Mom.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.975
Oh, well, what a surprise.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.077
Dad, shut up!
RJ, you can trust me,

10:46.079 --> 10:47.078
okay?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.880
Whatever it is,
we can do this.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.281
Please, just give me the gun.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.017
(siren wailing)

10:52.019 --> 10:53.284
Oh, dear Lord, no.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.686
Now look what
you've done.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.121
SIMON:
RJ, it's okay.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.091
This is it.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.160
ED:
What's he doing?

11:03.397 --> 11:05.797
So much for the stealth
approach.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.409
SRU on the scene.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.877
Speak to you for a second?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.145
Yes, sir, there's
an armed teenager...

11:20.147 --> 11:21.780
I assume
you're new on the job.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.114
Yes, sir.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.850
Here's today's lesson:
armed and barricaded subjects

11:25.852 --> 11:28.019
tend to get freaked out
by sirens and flashing lights.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.154
You get me?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.321
I'll turn the lights off.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.356
All right,
move your car.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.824
I'll move my car.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.893
Sam, take
the back entrance.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.996
Rolland Strachan.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.330
Recognize the name?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.701
<i> Crown v. Porter, </i>
trial of the century?

11:42.703 --> 11:45.036
Right, right.
The defense attorney.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.938
Right, hence the mansion.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.773
Well, the family was loaded
from way back.

11:48.775 --> 11:49.941
Gold mines.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.176
Anything you don't know?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.977
Okay, that's it.
I've had enough of this.

11:52.979 --> 11:53.945
Dad!
Rolland!

11:53.947 --> 11:55.146
Your great-grandfather

11:55.148 --> 11:57.215
carried that gun
across the Chilkoot Pass.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.718
Your grandfather
wore it on Juno Beach.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.419
Does that mean
anything to you at all?

12:01.421 --> 12:03.755
It means that
that gun was meant

12:03.757 --> 12:04.956
to be used by a man,

12:04.958 --> 12:07.092
which is why you
can't do anything with it!

12:07.094 --> 12:08.527
Dad! Dad! Dad!

12:08.528 --> 12:09.961
Simon, listen to me.
Get out of the way!

12:09.963 --> 12:11.129
No!
Simon!

12:11.131 --> 12:12.063
(cries out)

12:12.065 --> 12:13.131
Shot fired.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.866
Sam, you cover
that back entrance.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.069
PARKER:
Team will attempt phone contact,

12:18.071 --> 12:20.171
but be ready
for immediate entry.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.908
Whoa... no more.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.777
RJ, no!

12:25.779 --> 12:26.978
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!

12:26.980 --> 12:28.046
Wait, we can fix this!

12:28.048 --> 12:29.481
Okay?!

12:30.517 --> 12:32.784
(phone ringing)

12:36.223 --> 12:37.922
Team, you have
eyes on subject?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.257
Negative.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.160
All right, prepare for entry.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.936
(cries):
Oh, my God, Rolland!

12:51.938 --> 12:54.539
ED (over bullhorn):
This is the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.942
Everybody in the Strachan house
needs to stay where they are!

12:57.944 --> 12:59.244
Clear on your count.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.513
Three, two, one.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.481
(loud bang)

13:03.483 --> 13:06.184
(banging)

13:06.186 --> 13:08.219
(fizzles)

13:13.160 --> 13:15.360
I've got action here,
smoke bombs!

13:15.362 --> 13:16.895
I need backup here.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.163
I'm blind. I repeat.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.165
I need backup.
I'm completely smoked out.

13:30.877 --> 13:31.976
(rattling)

13:31.978 --> 13:33.211
Stop! Police!

13:45.025 --> 13:47.158
Team, subject's in the ravine.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.460
Looks like we've got a manhunt.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.401
ED:
Wordy, containment?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.136
Can't really
block off a ravine,

13:58.138 --> 14:00.104
but we've got all
the bordering roads contained,

14:00.106 --> 14:01.306
checkpoints
at every exit,

14:01.308 --> 14:03.875
uniforms are already
out beating the bush.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.376
All right, good.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.612
We've got a few dozen hikers,
bikers and family strollers.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.147
Let's clear them out,
keep them safe

14:09.149 --> 14:11.149
in case our subject decides
to do something stupid.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.284
Spike, how's the new toy?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.786
Acoustic Detector's
good to go.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.287
He fires anywhere within
earshot, we've got him.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.622
Excellent.
Yeah.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.357
Wordy, I want you in the Hummer.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.626
The rest of us, we will be
heading into the bush,

14:21.628 --> 14:23.094
diamond formation.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.029
One dog per unit.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.681
Let's keep to the grid.

14:26.682 --> 14:28.332
Let's clear it quad by quad.
(helicopter flying overhead)

14:28.335 --> 14:31.035
Keep in touch with the CP
and the other uniforms.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.604
Boss, how's the infrared coming?

14:32.606 --> 14:35.006
Chopper arrive?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.241
Yeah, it's messing up my hair.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.475
Better you than me.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.111
Infrared,
two minutes away, Eddie.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.013
Outstanding.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.982
Yeah, well, let's not forget
our subject's 18 years old,

14:43.984 --> 14:46.084
emotionally distraught
and afraid.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.353
He may be armed,
but he isn't Rambo.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.321
Let's see if we can
bring him back

14:50.323 --> 14:52.490
to his family
in one piece, okay?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.459
I'll try, boss.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.960
But those smoke bombs
were pretty clever.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.896
This guy's from around here.
He knows the area.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.332
All right,
infrared coming at you.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.434
Gentlemen and lady...

15:04.537 --> 15:06.437
(beeping)

15:06.439 --> 15:09.407
This is our Forward Looking
Infrared.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.242
Every dot is a heat signature,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.378
every heat signature
could be our subject.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.713
Don't suppose
they have an armed

15:14.714 --> 15:16.047
18 year old filter
for that thing?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.382
'Fraid not.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.250
Quad by quad.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.485
(ringing)

15:20.487 --> 15:22.020
Hey, Doc.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.188
What do you know about

15:24.190 --> 15:26.524
the Baden-Highsmith Academy
for Young Men.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.959
LURIA:
The military school?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.427
Not much.
Your shooter from there?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.513
Yeah, he was expelled recently.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.598
A fight with another kid,
the mother's saying.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.466
Expelled just for a fight?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.001
You know, I was wondering
the same thing, too.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.469
The parents
aren't talking a lot.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.238
Preliminary profile?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.539
Pretty textbook:

15:41.541 --> 15:44.175
well-to-do family,
successful parents...

15:44.177 --> 15:46.444
one sibling.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.546
He's got a history
of antisocial acts

15:48.548 --> 15:50.949
beginning in adolescence:
fights, petty theft,

15:50.951 --> 15:53.151
and, uh,
last year he was accused

15:53.153 --> 15:54.619
of starting a fire
at his private school.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.287
Steady escalation.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.289
You want to know, is this kid
just a danger to himself,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.624
his family,
or everybody else, too?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.427
I love it when you read my mind.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.696
Just call when you know.
Okay.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.664
If we could just

16:06.666 --> 16:08.967
go over what happened,
Mr. Strachan.
No.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.506
Remember who you are.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.379
(indistinct radio transmission)

16:22.349 --> 16:24.415
(helicopter blades whirring)

16:24.417 --> 16:27.452
WORDY:
Infrared's up and running.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.488
I'm headed east along
the main road by the ravine.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.291
What's your problem?

16:33.293 --> 16:36.227
Woods. My people
don't like them.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.029
Your people?

16:38.031 --> 16:39.197
From Woodbridge?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.832
No, Romans.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.466
Few times we fought
in the forest against the Huns

16:42.469 --> 16:44.369
didn't go so good, okay?

16:44.371 --> 16:48.339
WORDY:
Team one, I've got two
sigs northeast of your position.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.646
Heads up, 25 meters and closing.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.582
20 meters.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.686
18 meters... 17...

17:01.688 --> 17:03.488
Sixteen.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.524
15, they're right on you.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.464
Wordy, we've got
two more negatives.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.466
Jules.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.035
All right, girls.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.303
Come on, time to go home.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.805
Dozen more hot spots out there.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.608
Keep at it, guys.
Mrs. Strachan.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.543
My mom's exhausted.
I can tell you everything.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.646
My dad was
sitting right there.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.581
He was showing us

17:30.583 --> 17:33.184
our great-grandfather's old
gun-- it's a family heirloom.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.521
I know you're supposed
to check if it's loaded.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.656
I guess they didn't,
and my brother took it,

17:38.658 --> 17:40.158
it just went off.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.160
I mean, thank God it only
hit my dad in the arm.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.829
It was really just an accident.
All right, well,

17:44.831 --> 17:47.231
if it was just an accident,
how come your brother took off?

17:47.233 --> 17:51.436
Uh, well... my brother's
had a rough year.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.670
I guess...

17:52.672 --> 17:55.373
when he saw my dad
hurt, he just panicked.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.508
But, but he honestly
didn't mean it.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.344
I know my brother.
Okay, one more thing.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.579
You're saying your father
and brother were

18:01.581 --> 18:03.481
sitting here
when the gun went off?

18:03.483 --> 18:04.615
Yeah.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.684
Okay, well,
if he was hit here,

18:06.686 --> 18:08.386
and your brother
was sitting there,

18:08.388 --> 18:11.689
then the bullet would be
somewhere around here.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.293
But if they were standing,

18:15.295 --> 18:16.761
and your brother
was pointing the gun...

18:18.431 --> 18:19.664
...then the bullet

18:19.666 --> 18:22.300
would be about here.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.470
You want to try this again?

18:25.472 --> 18:27.805
(cell phone buzzing)
Yeah, yeah, fine.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.874
Just, do you mind
if I check something?

18:39.886 --> 18:41.185
Where the hell are you?

18:41.187 --> 18:42.420
You've got to help me, Simon.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.872
What am I supposed to do, huh?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.323
I mean, the cops are here
and they've got, like,

18:45.325 --> 18:47.492
an entire army out looking
for you, just come home.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.827
Mom's freaking out,
Dad's in the hospital.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.496
Is he going to be okay?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.630
Yeah, I think so.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.865
That's too bad.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.701
RJ, what's going on with you?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.336
Hey, don't worry about me.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.737
I'm fine, okay?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.706
We just got to get up north
and we'll be okay

19:01.708 --> 19:03.774
What "up north"? I don't even
know what you mean.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.476
Come on, you remember
those stories

19:05.478 --> 19:07.411
that Dad told
about the Chilkoot Pass?

19:07.413 --> 19:08.679
And his grandfather
being up there,

19:08.681 --> 19:10.314
and how he made
his name up there?

19:10.316 --> 19:12.250
Remember?
Yeah.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.417
That's what we're gonna do;
we're gonna go

19:13.419 --> 19:14.552
up there, we're gonna
make our name.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.686
Making our names?

19:15.688 --> 19:16.888
What are you talking about?

19:18.725 --> 19:21.492
(dog whimpers)
What's going on?

19:21.494 --> 19:22.894
It is, right?
We lose the trail?

19:22.896 --> 19:24.662
There's ammonia splashed
all over the place.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.763
Throws off the dogs.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.732
(whistles, dog whimpers)

19:27.734 --> 19:29.167
I mean, what?
This kid's

19:29.168 --> 19:30.601
holding ammonia
in case of a manhunt?

19:30.603 --> 19:32.236
Ammonia's good
for a lot of stuff:

19:32.238 --> 19:34.438
fertilizing, cleaning, bombs...

19:34.440 --> 19:35.740
You getting this, boss?

19:35.742 --> 19:37.642
ED:
Yeah, copy that.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.543
I mean, we can be whatever
we want to be up there.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.778
Nobody will know us.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.346
Okay, you'll be safe.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.814
I've just got to get you
away from them.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.616
Yeah, but I am getting away.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.817
I'm going to school, remember?

19:49.422 --> 19:50.721
RJ?

19:50.723 --> 19:52.423
Yeah.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.624
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.693
You're right, um...

19:58.498 --> 20:00.631
What about me?

20:03.670 --> 20:05.269
That's fine.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.704
You know what? It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.339
Do what you want, um...

20:08.341 --> 20:10.341
the least you can do
is help me out, though.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.742
I'm trying to help.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.844
No, I need money
to get up there.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.447
You know what?
Meet me at the place.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.316
You know where, by noon, okay?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.718
Do it or else... I gotta do
something else, you know?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.559
(indistinct radio transmission)

20:28.561 --> 20:30.695
(keys jingle)

20:30.697 --> 20:32.347
SAM:
Where are you going, Simon?

20:32.348 --> 20:33.998
Uh, I don't know.
I have to go out.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.334
Yeah? Where?
Mind if we tag along?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.835
No, it's...

20:37.837 --> 20:39.237
nah, it's not that important.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.972
(cell phone buzzing)

20:40.974 --> 20:42.373
Your phone's buzzing.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.541
Is that your brother, Simon?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.309
No. I don't know.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.477
You didn't even check it.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.979
PARKER:
Let's get a listing of all

20:47.981 --> 20:50.781
the Strachan family phones,
including RJ's cell.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.719
You... you know I'm not
going to tell you anything.

20:54.721 --> 20:58.589
You might not mean to,
but you are.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.791
We're just trying
to help your brother.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.527
You can help, too.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.502
MAN:
Of course we want to help
in any way we can.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.504
Then it would be helpful
if you could tell me

21:13.506 --> 21:15.039
more about why
you expelled RJ.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.974
And as I've
already explained,

21:16.976 --> 21:19.477
all I can tell you
is that he was de-enrolled

21:19.479 --> 21:21.712
following an altercation
with his cadet team leader.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.414
Well, was he alone
in the altercation?

21:23.416 --> 21:24.849
Any other boys involved

21:24.851 --> 21:25.850
were dealt with appropriately.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.418
To say anything more...

21:27.420 --> 21:28.753
Requires written
consent of his parents.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.388
We don't have time
for that right now.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.989
If you want to help RJ,
you'll help me...

21:31.991 --> 21:34.358
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I've told you all I can.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.794
Now, you're welcome to take
Cadet Strachan's file.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.729
And please,
give my regrets,

21:38.731 --> 21:40.498
and regards
to his father.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.935
It's about RJ?

21:45.905 --> 21:47.371
You know RJ?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.543
We're heading north
on those coordinates.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.579
Triangulated

21:54.580 --> 21:56.614
signal from the kid's cell
phone's up ahead.

21:56.616 --> 22:00.818
Only you guys showing up
on infrared. Sorry.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.860
Got a visual
on a domicile,

22:09.862 --> 22:11.862
50 meters from our position.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.898
WORDY:
Still no infrared, guys.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.500
The kid's got survival training,
knows about camouflage.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.502
He gets enough cover
on top of him,

22:18.504 --> 22:20.871
he can hide his heat signature,
so be careful.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.973
(snaps fingers)

22:49.969 --> 22:52.803
This is the Strategic
Response Unit.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.939
RJ, come on out,
we don't want to hurt you.

22:54.941 --> 22:57.041
We can help.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.983
Give him a blast
of CS gas.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.528
Boss, you sure
about that reading?

23:17.530 --> 23:18.662
He hasn't moved.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.064
Kid's playing possum.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.629
¶ ¶

24:07.814 --> 24:09.847
We've got some news
about RJ.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.482
Is he okay?

24:11.484 --> 24:14.185
Did you know he's been using
crystal methamphetamine?

24:14.187 --> 24:15.553
(chuckles)

24:15.555 --> 24:17.221
No, no, there's no way.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.457
Right now he's
in an unstable state--

24:19.459 --> 24:21.492
euphoria, paranoia, mania.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.110
The fact that he's been using

24:23.111 --> 24:24.727
in the middle of all this, that
tells us that he's bingeing,

24:24.730 --> 24:26.664
and he's headed
for a major crash, okay?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.616
So, we need

24:28.617 --> 24:30.567
to bring him back before
he hurts himself any more.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.069
Or anyone else.

24:32.071 --> 24:35.706
I can't deal with this
right now.

24:35.708 --> 24:39.477
Mom, please,
what am I supposed to do?

24:39.479 --> 24:40.511
You should leave.

24:40.513 --> 24:41.579
While you can.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.148
Before your father
comes back.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.855
All I can do is say I'm sorry.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.927
What else have I ever done?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.507
Hold it,
I can help you with this.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.077
Okay. How?

25:15.047 --> 25:18.215
I can show you
where my brother's hiding.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.918
(helicopter blades whirring)

25:25.892 --> 25:27.958
Just around that bend.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.564
No trail here.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.633
SAM:
He's saying go through
the thicket.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.572
All right,
it's pretty heavy brush.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.074
Extended line formation,
ten to 15 meters apart.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.143
Let's go.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.815
PARKER:
Hey, Sam.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.951
Walk away from the kid.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.262
Jules told me about your buddy.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.697
My condolences.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.332
Anyway, you and the kid seem

26:08.334 --> 26:10.568
to have a good connection going.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.603
He may open up more to you,

26:12.605 --> 26:16.140
and if he does I just need you
to listen for some things.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.608
I don't...

26:17.610 --> 26:19.209
That's really not my thing yet,
boss.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.644
No, no, no, you're doing fine.

26:20.646 --> 26:21.345
You're doing fine.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.080
Just trust your instincts.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.583
This secret trail,
hiding place

26:25.585 --> 26:27.284
from when they were kids,
you buy it?

26:27.286 --> 26:28.969
Yeah.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.653
He knows his brother.
Where he's going.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.656
Okay then.

26:32.658 --> 26:35.059
I think you need to ask him
something.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.094
Whether he answers or not

26:37.096 --> 26:39.129
here's what we're looking for...

26:39.131 --> 26:40.230
I've been worried
about him.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.599
Is he okay?

26:41.601 --> 26:42.366
Hard to say.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.234
Cops haven't brought
him in yet.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.236
He's in a lot of trouble.

26:46.238 --> 26:49.306
So you want to tell me
about the meth, Torley?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.743
Look, I could care less

26:52.745 --> 26:54.678
about the "how"
and "who" of this.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.814
I just need
to know "why."

26:56.816 --> 26:58.983
RJ was different from
the rest of us.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.818
He worked hard, stayed
out of trouble.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.988
Kept saying: One year and
I'm outta here, one year.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.990
Was a good guy.

27:05.992 --> 27:08.993
Then one night he comes
to me, he can't sleep.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.661
He's having nightmares.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.663
It turns out he doesn't
want to sleep.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.031
He wants to stay up.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.699
So he starts taking meth?

27:15.701 --> 27:17.901
Taking it and making it;
he loves chemistry.

27:17.903 --> 27:20.638
But he didn't
really lose it

27:20.640 --> 27:22.673
until the thing with the
cadet leader, Simpson.

27:22.675 --> 27:23.941
Mm-hmm.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.912
Two nights ago,

27:28.914 --> 27:32.416
it's me, a couple other
guys, RJ, we're partying.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.786
Simpson finds us,
goes berserk,

27:35.788 --> 27:37.087
we're all going home,
blah, blah, blah.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.123
Of course he comes
at me first.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.290
Why of course?

27:40.292 --> 27:41.425
Because I'm half
his size.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.260
He's just a douche that way.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.928
But, so he-he grabs me,

27:44.930 --> 27:48.232
and RJ just goes
off on him,

27:48.234 --> 27:51.235
starts kicking his ass,
total hardcore.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.270
Simpson's still in
the infirmary.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.673
I guess that was enough
for the school.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.842
And that was it for RJ.

27:58.844 --> 28:02.179
I hope he's got good
friends out there.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.715
'Cause none of us were much
good for him in here.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.756
I've got his shoes again.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.793
You're not at the trail yet.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.094
I know.
And they're heading that way,

28:17.096 --> 28:18.328
but...

28:19.832 --> 28:21.899
Sam, lines of force
are supposed to go

28:21.901 --> 28:24.034
in the opposite direction
of the track, correct?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.269
Yeah.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.271
Well, these are going
the same way.

28:27.273 --> 28:30.274
Doesn't make any sense.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.409
Unless he's wearing
his shoes backwards,

28:32.411 --> 28:34.445
and bringing us
on a goose chase.

28:34.447 --> 28:38.148
SAM:
Ed, you want to follow
the footprints back?

28:38.150 --> 28:39.483
Go plan, Sam.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.018
Let's go back

28:41.020 --> 28:44.021
500 meters,
if nothing we turn back.

28:44.023 --> 28:47.091
Sam, bring the Hummer around
and meet us.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.794
Good, deeper.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.133
Why are they going that way?

28:56.135 --> 28:57.801
The trail's the other way.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.772
My boss...

29:01.774 --> 29:02.806
he's a really smart guy.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.808
He can tell things about people.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.811
He wanted me to ask you...

29:07.813 --> 29:09.179
your old man--

29:09.181 --> 29:11.248
he hit you and RJ?

29:16.489 --> 29:19.523
So you grew up around here, huh?

29:19.525 --> 29:23.127
Running around, hide-and-go-
seek, that kind of thing?

29:27.433 --> 29:29.767
PARKER:
Okay, team,
heads up, eyes sharp.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.435
This kid's headed for a crash.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.504
When he does,
it's gonna be fast and ugly.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.408
I never had a brother.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.943
Must be nice.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.945
It kind of depends.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.448
When he shoots your dad and gets
the cops coming after him,

29:44.450 --> 29:45.849
not so much.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.518
(laughs)

29:47.520 --> 29:51.188
A lot of guys I know,
same thing--  out of control.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.523
They just needed
a little guidance.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.891
They turned out okay.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.893
Yeah?
Yeah. Sure.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.861
This one guy I knew,
basic training--

29:57.863 --> 29:59.863
loud, dumb, fat.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.332
Everybody says, this is the guy
who ditches out in a week.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.433
We took bets and everything.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.102
Six months later,

30:05.104 --> 30:06.970
he was at the head
of the grad parade.

30:06.972 --> 30:10.040
Wasn't a guy there who wouldn't
follow him anywhere.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.911
I spent a week on a mountainside
with him.

30:13.913 --> 30:17.114
He told me about his family.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.448
Believe me.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.001
I figured, "Man,

30:21.002 --> 30:23.553
if you can get through that,
you can get through anything."

30:23.556 --> 30:25.556
So he turned out okay?

30:25.558 --> 30:27.491
Yeah.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.359
Sure he did.

30:31.831 --> 30:34.097
Somewhere you need to be, Simon?

30:41.941 --> 30:44.408
(gunshot)

30:44.410 --> 30:46.076
Shot fired.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.377
Anybody see the flash?

30:47.379 --> 30:48.946
Negative.
Negative.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.414
What's happening?
What are you doing?

30:50.416 --> 30:52.616
If that was RJ, we're gonna
find him with this.

30:52.618 --> 30:53.884
Please don't hurt him.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.886
Do not hurt him.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.354
(beeping)
Got it!

30:57.356 --> 30:58.956
Okay, Team,
shot signature's coming

30:58.958 --> 31:01.258
from Quadrant 4-C,
that's 100 meters due east.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.960
We're gonna do
a pincer formation.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.128
Ed, Jules, Wordy,
you're Alpha, head northeast

31:05.130 --> 31:07.130
around 25 degrees, 100 meters.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.866
You'll be in Quadrant 4-B.

31:08.868 --> 31:11.034
Spike, Lewis-- Bravo,

31:11.036 --> 31:13.503
southeast 120 degrees,
hit him from below.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.544
Alpha, we got a sig coming
right at you.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.986
Jules.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.988
Okay, you're okay.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.022
You're okay.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.490
Can you tell me what happened?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.392
I was running, and-and-
and he had a gun,

31:35.394 --> 31:37.661
and I didn't have any money
and he went to hit me

31:37.663 --> 31:39.997
and so I ran and then
he shot at me.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.569
Bravo Team, you're almost
on another sig, be careful.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.307
Hold up, hold up.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.042
What? You hear something?

31:54.013 --> 31:55.946
Whoa!

31:55.948 --> 31:57.080
Hey!

31:57.082 --> 31:59.016
Lew, I'm on fire!
I'm on fire!

31:59.018 --> 31:59.950
Spike!

31:59.952 --> 32:03.120
Officer down!
Officer down!

32:03.122 --> 32:05.022
Quad 4-C!

32:05.024 --> 32:06.657
We need assistance!
(Spike yelling)

32:06.659 --> 32:08.692
Officer down! Officer down!

32:11.330 --> 32:12.629
I'm fine. Thanks.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.231
Ammonium trilodide.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.532
Homemade explosive

32:15.534 --> 32:18.702
of every anarchist jackass
and troublemaker.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.204
Kid hits me with
ammonium triiodide.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.073
Unbelievable.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.241
I'm sorry, man.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.375
I should have seen him.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.543
I'm sorry.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.545
Bro, seriously, shut up.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.380
But I will say, this
one last time--

32:30.382 --> 32:32.082
Romans and woods.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.151
All I'm saying.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.627
All right, I'm here.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.162
According to the doc,

32:45.164 --> 32:47.197
the kid didn't just attack
the cadet leader.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.498
He attacked the cadet leader

32:48.500 --> 32:50.600
after he saw him grab
another kid.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.270
Abused kids lash out.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.539
But this looks like a kid
who got used to lashing out

32:55.541 --> 32:58.275
to protect someone else,
like a baby brother.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.577
The path Simon marked for us
was the exact opposite

33:00.579 --> 33:02.245
of where RJ was headed.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.680
Kid lied to us.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.048
I guess I was wrong.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.817
I got a man down.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.585
And I could care less about
about this kid's psychodrama.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.654
This game is over now.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.523
I don't want you rushing
back in angry, Ed.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.392
It's a little late
for that, boss.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.910
Let me talk to the kid.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.427
You know what?
I appreciate the effort, Sam,

33:18.430 --> 33:20.263
but... this is their bond.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.399
You're never gonna get brother
to turn on brother.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.401
The kid's a lost lead.

33:24.403 --> 33:25.702
No. I just didn't get it before.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.238
Let me try one more time.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.713
You just gonna let him hang,

33:36.715 --> 33:39.549
like everybody else has?

33:39.551 --> 33:42.019
You don't know
anything about us.

33:42.021 --> 33:45.355
I know this: Your brother's
gonna get killed.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.324
Maybe that's what he wants.

33:47.326 --> 33:51.361
Is that what you want?

33:51.363 --> 33:55.499
Whether it was a...

33:55.501 --> 34:00.103
belt, or a cane,
or sometimes just a fist...

34:00.105 --> 34:01.738
RJ was always there,

34:01.740 --> 34:03.540
standing right in front of me,

34:03.542 --> 34:06.343
taking the worst of it
every time.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.311
He'd say,

34:08.313 --> 34:10.347
"What are you so scared of, huh?

34:10.349 --> 34:11.748
I'm still here, aren't I?"

34:18.657 --> 34:22.392
How am I supposed
to turn him in after that, huh?

34:22.394 --> 34:25.595
I-I can't tur...

34:33.539 --> 34:36.573
You'll be saving him
by bringing him in.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.841
Or you're going to spend
the rest of your life

34:37.843 --> 34:39.342
wondering what
might have happened

34:39.344 --> 34:40.844
if you just tried.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.515
Look, I...

34:45.517 --> 34:47.717
I promise you this:

34:47.719 --> 34:51.621
Together, we can bring
your brother back alive.

34:51.623 --> 34:55.659
Because so long as he's alive,
there-there's hope, right?

35:16.482 --> 35:19.149
Hey, I knew you'd come.
Remember this place?

35:19.151 --> 35:20.717
Remember the summers
we used to have here?
Yeah.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.486
Remember that?
Yeah. Sure.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.657
You burned up that
cop pretty bad, RJ.

35:27.659 --> 35:28.692
Yeah. Okay, well...

35:28.694 --> 35:30.460
He shouldn't have come
after me then.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.462
You know,
that's what you get.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.500
Hey. Hey, hey, hey...

35:36.502 --> 35:38.235
It's okay, man.

35:38.237 --> 35:41.538
It's me, buddy.
What are you so scared of?

35:41.540 --> 35:45.542
Meth? Blowing up cops
in the woods.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.512
I mean, who does this?
Who are you now?

35:48.514 --> 35:51.548
The same guy who was there
for you every night...

35:51.550 --> 35:53.750
every time.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.353
Do you remember him?

35:57.356 --> 35:59.556
Yeah. I just...

35:59.558 --> 36:02.559
That guy never scared me before.

36:02.561 --> 36:05.595
I am... I'm just tired, Simon.

36:05.597 --> 36:06.696
You know?

36:06.698 --> 36:09.933
Yeah. I know, man.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.636
I was up there, and, uh...

36:12.638 --> 36:14.738
well, I was doing good.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.873
I was.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.543
I started getting
these nightmares,

36:19.545 --> 36:20.911
and I just figured
if I stayed up, you know,

36:20.913 --> 36:23.246
I'd just... I'd be okay.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.447
You know, I'd just get
through the year.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.749
Come back to you.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.651
We'd get out of here.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.719
We'd be safe, you know?

36:29.721 --> 36:32.322
RJ, no matter where we go,
it'll still be us.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.924
Okay. Good.

36:33.926 --> 36:35.492
Okay, well,
let's go then.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.593
Come on.
No, RJ,
just listen.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.563
Remember that time
Dad lost his watch

36:39.565 --> 36:42.465
and he blamed me?

36:42.467 --> 36:43.667
Yeah.

36:43.669 --> 36:44.935
And he came at me
at dinner,

36:44.937 --> 36:46.603
and he had
that old belt.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.539
You jumped in and you grabbed
it, remember that?

36:49.541 --> 36:51.341
Yeah, sure. Of course.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.843
It hurt like hell.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.645
Yeah. And you grabbed it

36:55.647 --> 36:57.614
even though it almost
ripped off your hand.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.516
You wouldn't let go.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.551
Yeah.
He was pulling on it,

37:01.553 --> 37:02.786
and he was going crazy,

37:02.788 --> 37:04.654
and mom was crying
and I was crying,

37:04.656 --> 37:05.956
but you wouldn't let go.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.424
Okay.

37:07.426 --> 37:10.460
I just want you to know,
I'll never forget that.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.628
Yeah, okay.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.396
That you wouldn't let go.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.698
I'm never going to let you go,
either, RJ,

37:14.700 --> 37:16.733
no matter what happens.
All right?

37:16.735 --> 37:18.868
Okay. Sure.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.737
I don't know what
you're talking about, man,

37:20.739 --> 37:23.840
but, uh, we should
really get out of here.

37:23.842 --> 37:27.244
No, no. No matter what happens.

37:27.246 --> 37:30.013
What do you mean, man?

37:30.015 --> 37:33.483
I just, I'm...

37:33.485 --> 37:34.884
No way.
RJ...

37:34.886 --> 37:36.019
RJ...
No way.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.621
RJ, just...
No way.

37:37.623 --> 37:40.590
(grunts)

37:40.592 --> 37:41.691
RJ...

37:44.730 --> 37:47.397
(yells)
RJ!

37:47.399 --> 37:48.965
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.635
No, RJ! RJ, no!

37:51.637 --> 37:55.538
Settle down, settle down.
RJ! RJ!

37:55.540 --> 37:58.041
No!
Hey, hey, I got him.
I got him.

37:58.043 --> 38:01.411
It's okay.
RJ!

38:01.413 --> 38:02.579
Let go of him!
I'm sorry!

38:02.581 --> 38:05.415
It's okay now.
It's over.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.551
Get off of him!
SIMON:
I'm sorry!

38:08.553 --> 38:10.287
(softly):
I got you.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.756
It's okay, soldier.
I got you.

38:20.532 --> 38:21.965
Uh-uh.
Excuse me.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.466
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.934
That's just, uh...
that's not gonna happen.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.703
And why is that exactly?

38:26.705 --> 38:29.739
That's a good question.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.741
Here's a better question, sir.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.943
Who does the big-time
lawyer call

38:33.945 --> 38:34.844
when he needs a big-time lawyer?

38:39.551 --> 38:41.685
I've had
just about enough of this.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.988
Haven't we all.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.864
Hey.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.633
Lewis and Spike are
out of the hospital.

38:56.635 --> 38:57.834
You seen Sarge?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.402
Yeah, he met up with a doctor.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.670
They're gonna get that kid
a psych evaluation.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.772
They don't think
he belongs in jail.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.741
Where's Sam at?

39:04.742 --> 39:06.709
Oh, had, um,
he had some personal stuff.

39:10.649 --> 39:14.451
¶ You ¶

39:14.453 --> 39:19.789
¶ You and I made a pact ¶

39:19.791 --> 39:25.628
¶ A deal that as we lay dying ¶

39:25.630 --> 39:32.068
¶ We'd think
about each other then ¶

39:32.070 --> 39:35.705
¶ And smile as we're taken in ¶

39:35.707 --> 39:37.907
¶ I... ¶

39:37.909 --> 39:43.513
¶ I listen
like a little child ¶

39:43.515 --> 39:50.620
¶ To the story
of your earthbound pilot ¶

39:50.622 --> 39:56.760
¶ He plummeted so violent ¶

39:56.762 --> 40:03.833
¶ A parachute not opening ¶

40:03.835 --> 40:08.738
¶ And rushing to oblivion ¶

40:08.740 --> 40:14.778
¶ He broke
into that knowing grin ¶

40:14.780 --> 40:18.181
¶ ¶

40:29.661 --> 40:32.662
¶ And I ¶

40:32.664 --> 40:38.168
¶ I think about that a lot ¶

40:38.170 --> 40:45.508
¶ 'Cause a lot is
what I've not got ¶

40:45.510 --> 40:51.714
¶ A smile is
what I least expect ¶

40:51.716 --> 40:54.784
¶ From the clutches
of this darkness ¶

40:54.786 --> 40:59.722
¶ You billowed
like a bowl of silk ¶

40:59.724 --> 41:03.993
¶ And slowed me
from my ruining. ¶
