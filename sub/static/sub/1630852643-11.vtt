00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.062
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.992
Good morning, Fraggle Rock.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.495
All right. Lots to do.
Lots of problems to solve.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.791
Doozer buildings everywhere,
waterfall's dry, Merggles need help!

01:23.834 --> 01:29.381
But I'll be in a much better place
to help after some exercise, so…

01:31.717 --> 01:34.178
Let's kick the day off with a dive.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.639
Goggles? Check. Towel? Round my neck.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.267
Me, out the door? Just one sec.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.688
There's nothing better than
a morning dive.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.357
Nothing beats a morning dive.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.911
The best part of my day, right--

02:01.997 --> 02:03.916
Sorry, Red. Don't dive.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.000
Look!

02:05.751 --> 02:07.544
The water's all gooed up!

02:08.711 --> 02:12.716
The gross Doozer sticks melted down.
You can't swim in that. See?

02:14.760 --> 02:18.138
By the way, someone gave me a whistle!

02:27.481 --> 02:29.650
Exactly as I suspected.

02:29.733 --> 02:33.070
The goo from those new Doozer sticks
has polluted the water,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.780
causing the Merggles to hiccup.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.034
Didn't we already know that?

02:39.117 --> 02:42.996
Well, we did. But maybe I just wanted
to wear my doctor clothes today.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.250
Thank you for that honesty, Boober.

02:46.333 --> 02:50.462
At least we're not
in that gnar gnar goo water.

02:50.546 --> 02:51.421
Yeah.

02:51.505 --> 02:55.884
Thanks for letting us chill
in your washtubs, Boober.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.219
You're welcome.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.806
They're just my favorite things
in the world.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.808
Please be good to them?

03:09.648 --> 03:12.484
Okay. What if we were
to scare the Merggles, huh?

03:12.568 --> 03:14.820
We could startle the hiccups
right out of 'em.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.740
Genius! My best friend is a genius!

03:18.824 --> 03:21.118
-No, you're a genius.
-No, you're a genius.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.911
-No, you're a genius!
-You are.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.830
-You are. You are.
-You are. You are.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.083
Okay, okay, okay!
You're both geniuses, okay?

03:28.166 --> 03:29.710
-Okay.
-Now, Wembley.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.547
What do you say you and I go
and brainstorm some scare ideas, huh?

03:33.630 --> 03:34.631
I love it!

03:35.132 --> 03:37.593
First thought, what's a brainstorm?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.636
There isn't lightning, is there?

03:40.262 --> 03:41.722
Oh, wow.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.476
Hey, Red! How are you?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
Honestly, not great.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.273
There are so many problems
in Fraggle Rock.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.774
All I wanna do is help.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.277
And I'm a better helper after I dive.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.947
But I can't dive right now
because of the water.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.409
And the water is one of the problems
I want to help solve.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.036
I can't help until I dive.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.955
And it becomes
this whole loop kind of thing.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.416
Red, I know how much you love to help.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.044
And not being able to help
is a real hiccup.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.339
And that's another problem
I want to help solve.

04:16.423 --> 04:21.803
Red, Red, Red, Red.
Red, you are a kaleidoscope of emotions.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.847
We do have a lot to do,

04:23.931 --> 04:28.101
but maybe the universe is telling you
to take a moment and relax.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.938
Relax…

04:31.438 --> 04:33.982
Relax.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.109
Nah. Doesn't sound like me.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.904
Maybe diving is not
the only way to feel your best.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.366
You could try something new.
Know who's always trying something new?

04:42.449 --> 04:45.786
-Please don't say Uncle Matt.
-Uncle Travelling Matt. How'd you know?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.413
Listen to this postcard.
It just might help.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.874
"Dear Nephew Gobo…"

04:50.958 --> 04:55.629
Just the other day,
I was analyzing the wilds of Outer Space.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.756
It was serious business.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.846
And there they were.

05:03.929 --> 05:08.392
The most beautiful thing
nature had to offer: puffy piffles.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.477
They looked so relaxed.

05:10.561 --> 05:14.481
I want to float with you. I do, I do.

05:14.565 --> 05:18.068
And, young Gobo,
luck was on my side that day.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.905
I found a way to meet the puffy piffles
in their domain.

05:21.989 --> 05:26.201
I mean, really, Gobo,
can you imagine anything more relaxing?

05:27.536 --> 05:28.537
Help me!

05:29.121 --> 05:33.500
With no help whatsoever,
I soared alongside the piffles.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.585
I hate this!

05:34.668 --> 05:37.671
And I loved it, Gobo, really loved it.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.673
And I wished it went on forever.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.634
Make it stop. Make it stop now!

05:45.637 --> 05:48.432
It was a triumphant day
for your Uncle Matt.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.603
And if there's one thing I hope
to impart to you, it's this:

05:52.686 --> 05:55.355
Never be afraid to try something new.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.942
"Love, your Uncle Travelling Matt."

05:59.443 --> 06:02.988
Hey, your Uncle Matt is right.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.489
-What?
-What?

06:04.573 --> 06:07.409
I can't believe I'm saying it either,
but he's right.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.037
Diving can't be the only way
to clear my head.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.998
I need a new extreme activity.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.586
I'm going to zip-line
through the Great Hall!

06:18.337 --> 06:20.214
No, Red. That doesn't sound very safe.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.009
I'm telling you, Red,
the universe is asking you to slow down.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.179
-Yeah.
-I am not slowing down. I'm Red!

06:27.262 --> 06:31.975
I move, I jump, sometimes I lunge,
but I do not sit still.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.732
I can't sit still anymore.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.401
Ever since the Fraggles stopped
eating our buildings

06:41.485 --> 06:45.239
and we haven't been able to work,
I feel like I'm losing it, Dr. Level.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.450
Well, okay. Thank you for sharing.

06:48.534 --> 06:52.162
And it's talking about it
that's gonna get us through this together.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.622
Is it?

06:53.705 --> 06:54.915
Is it?

06:57.709 --> 06:58.710
There, there.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.048
Hopefully, this hydro-strainer gets
the goo out of the water

07:03.131 --> 07:05.133
so we can start building again.

07:09.805 --> 07:14.560
I wish we'd never broken that vine and
discovered this goo in the first place.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.103
Cotterpin!

07:16.186 --> 07:18.897
We're in a great pause,
but you're not pausing.

07:18.981 --> 07:23.443
Come join group.
Dr. Level is really helping me out.

07:23.527 --> 07:27.072
I slept for almost five minutes
last night.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.534
I can't rest
until I get the goo out of the water.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.870
I just need to focus.

07:32.953 --> 07:37.457
Okay. I hear you, I see you,
and I respect your needs.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.710
Dr. Level taught me that.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.004
He's, like, really great!

07:43.964 --> 07:48.051
Sky bucket!
Mysterious sky bucket coming in!

07:55.267 --> 07:56.435
Yeah!

07:56.518 --> 08:01.523
Junior Junior, this is the last bucket
of water I need for Ma and Pa's bath.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.609
I think I did a pretty good j--

08:06.570 --> 08:07.696
Oh, boy.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.950
What is this goo?

08:12.034 --> 08:14.661
I hope none of it gets into Ma and Pa's--

08:14.745 --> 08:15.746
Junior!

08:15.829 --> 08:19.041
What is this slimy gunk in my bath?

08:19.124 --> 08:22.544
Yeah, it's ooky gooky!

08:22.628 --> 08:24.922
What goo? I-- I didn't see any--

08:25.005 --> 08:27.090
Why, we just love it.

08:27.174 --> 08:31.428
My chin fur's never been softer.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.556
Great job, sweet muffin!

08:35.890 --> 08:37.976
I'm off to get some more goo water.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.602
Yeah.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.063
Goo water, goo wa--

08:42.898 --> 08:43.899
Again?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.777
Okay, okay, Sprock!

08:47.819 --> 08:50.572
I can't believe you have fleas.

08:50.656 --> 08:53.825
I don't have time for this
on top of everything else.

08:53.909 --> 08:57.454
No, no, no. Sprock, don't scratch!
We have medicine for that.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.379
If it makes you feel better,
you look like a cute lamp.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.259
All right. Well, the vet says
this medicine should help.

09:10.342 --> 09:13.887
But make it quick 'cause I've got
some plastic-eating bacteria to grow.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.098
Say, "Ah!"

09:20.102 --> 09:22.604
All right, that's done. Back to my lab.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.526
Did you just spit that out?

09:29.736 --> 09:33.448
Poor Merggles.
That Doozer stick goo really got to them.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.618
If we can't scare them
out of their hiccups,

09:36.702 --> 09:40.205
-they may never catch their breath.
-And I may never get my tubs back.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.959
Which is obviously a secondary issue.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.586
But it's not not an issue.

09:45.669 --> 09:46.962
Anyway, don't worry.

09:47.045 --> 09:51.633
Wembley and I brainstormed
and came up with something pretty scary.

09:51.717 --> 09:52.551
Yep!

09:52.634 --> 09:54.553
-Ready, Wembley? Go get 'em.
-Oh, yeah.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.983
So, you guys were gone quite a while.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.569
That's what you came up with?

10:10.652 --> 10:13.530
Well, Wembley spent a lot of time dancing.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.407
Yeah, I got the dancing bug.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.955
Maybe I should help out on the next one.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.625
Okay. Though I don't know
how you're gonna top it.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.126
Yeah.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.632
My friends are worried for nothing.

10:31.715 --> 10:35.219
Dangerous, schmangerous. I'll be fine.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.556
Yeah!

10:43.852 --> 10:45.062
I'm not fine.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.610
Please tell me that wasn't my baloobius.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.197
That was your baloobius!

10:55.280 --> 10:56.365
Hi, Red!

10:59.952 --> 11:01.537
Yummy peanut butter.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.169
Cheese!

11:12.714 --> 11:15.592
Come on! That was my best cheddar.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.761
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

11:17.845 --> 11:20.180
Come on! Open up!
You got to take your medicine!

11:20.264 --> 11:21.515
Come on. Come on!

11:21.598 --> 11:23.600
There we go. Yeah!

11:26.895 --> 11:30.858
Oh, great. A sprained baloobius!

11:32.401 --> 11:35.529
Now I really can't help anyone.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.115
I feel so lost.

11:39.491 --> 11:44.121
Once I knew just what to do

11:44.204 --> 11:47.749
Once I knew my name

11:48.917 --> 11:50.377
Far and near

11:50.460 --> 11:52.963
The road was clear

11:53.046 --> 11:56.049
Living was a game

11:57.384 --> 12:01.847
But now I seem to walk in dreams

12:01.930 --> 12:06.393
And nothing stays the way it seems

12:07.227 --> 12:10.355
How I long for then

12:11.773 --> 12:14.860
Easy once again

12:15.569 --> 12:19.448
Once upon a time

12:19.531 --> 12:21.575
I knew my name

12:24.536 --> 12:28.957
I know that no one's made of steel

12:29.041 --> 12:33.670
I sometimes think that nothing's real

12:34.171 --> 12:37.799
And then I wake at night

12:38.592 --> 12:41.845
I can't tell wrong from right

12:42.846 --> 12:46.308
Once upon a time

12:46.391 --> 12:53.065
I knew my name

13:04.201 --> 13:06.078
Red? Red!

13:06.745 --> 13:08.288
Are you okay?

13:10.624 --> 13:11.625
I'm fine.

13:11.708 --> 13:16.255
It's just, how do you help
when you feel helpless?

13:17.172 --> 13:18.882
Oh, Red.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.932
Okay. Yeah. You-- You let it all out.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.142
Hey, Red, Red, Red, Red!

13:29.226 --> 13:32.479
I know something
that's gonna make you feel better!

13:32.563 --> 13:34.982
Is it diving?

13:35.065 --> 13:38.485
Follow me, and all will be revealed.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.201
What is this place?

13:46.285 --> 13:48.996
This, dear Red, is the Mood Ring.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.833
It's where
you are going to learn to meditate.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.924
Okay. Remember, guys,
we have to scare the Merggles.

14:03.719 --> 14:06.555
Okay. Be really, really quiet.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.516
They have no idea
how scared they're gonna be.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.102
And, now!

14:21.486 --> 14:22.863
You okay?

14:22.946 --> 14:23.947
I'm okay.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.368
Meditating?

14:28.452 --> 14:32.039
And I told you sitting still
is not my thing.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.334
It can be anyone's thing.
It's easy. Let me show you.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.840
Lighting change. Okay.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.805
Look out! There's blobs flying around you.

14:48.889 --> 14:52.100
They're thought bulbs,
each of a different sort:

14:52.184 --> 14:56.146
worry, stress, happiness, fear.

14:56.230 --> 14:59.525
The key is to acknowledge them
and let them pass.

15:00.859 --> 15:05.197
Yes, I am afraid that I don't always
live up to others' expectations.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.699
All I can do is my best. Thanks, bulb.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.540
I feel great. Now it's your turn.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.460
You know, I gotta go count my pigtails.

15:19.086 --> 15:22.673
You think it'd be easy.
One, two. But then you gotta recount.

15:22.756 --> 15:26.885
-It's a whole thing.
-Red. Just sit still and be calm.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.349
I'm already bored.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.684
Just breathe.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.270
I don't know about this.

15:36.353 --> 15:40.399
And take all that worry
and transform it into breath.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.153
Am I breathing?

15:45.237 --> 15:48.991
Okay, just acknowledge the thoughts
and softly let them go.

15:51.118 --> 15:55.622
Let them pass.
Don't hit them. Permit them.

15:55.706 --> 15:58.083
-I'm trying.
-Well, try not to try.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.085
That doesn't make any sense.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.712
Just relax!

16:01.795 --> 16:06.008
There's nothing relaxing about this!

16:08.760 --> 16:12.014
Okay. Good first attempt.
Let's take a moment and try again.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.767
-Just, you know, doing better this time.
-Nope. Red is done.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.020
But, Red…

16:19.313 --> 16:20.397
Baloobius.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.068
I know, bulb. I'm worried about her too.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.030
-Cotterpin.
-Yeah?

16:28.113 --> 16:31.408
You've been working on this all day.
You need a break.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.078
How am I supposed to take a break
when this problem isn't solved?

16:35.162 --> 16:40.125
Sometimes you got to put your tools down
and come back later with fresh screws.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.669
Wow, Wrench. You're right.

16:42.753 --> 16:47.174
Maybe I do need to step away
to get a fresh perspective.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.345
Come to group. We have cookies.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.728
Ma and Pa love me.

17:00.354 --> 17:03.148
I did something good,
all thanks to that goo.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.858
And I'll get some goo for you,
Junior Junior.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.448
J-J-Junior Junior? What's wrong?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.159
The goo's hurting you?
Hold on, little buddy.

17:14.242 --> 17:18.704
I'll get some fresh water for you
from our Gorg water fountain.

17:18.789 --> 17:22.709
Well, maybe what's good for us Gorgs
isn't good for everyone.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.381
I'll take care of you.

17:28.507 --> 17:29.842
You'll be just fine.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.767
-You guys. This is gonna be so good.
-Yeah.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.102
-Hi, Mokey. Guess what?
-Hi.

17:40.185 --> 17:43.063
We have a foolproof plan
to scare the Merggles to their core.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.732
Well, hopefully something works today.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.359
Yeah, okay. So let's review.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.779
Okay. I approach with a pie and say,

17:50.863 --> 17:55.284
"Hello, Merggles.
Who would like some delicious pie?

17:55.367 --> 17:58.787
I promise you, it's not gnar gnar."

17:58.871 --> 18:02.207
That is good. You are using
their language, and everybody loves pie.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.959
-Yeah.
-There's a pie for everyone.

18:04.042 --> 18:07.337
Don't like fruit? Chocolate-cream pie.
Don't like chunks? Key lime pie.

18:07.421 --> 18:10.007
Pie that pairs well with cheese?
Upside-down radish pie.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.300
-I have blue pie!
-Perfect!

18:11.383 --> 18:12.676
-Yes!
-Okay, Wembley. You go.

18:13.302 --> 18:15.387
And then I'll throw down some foggy fruit…

18:15.470 --> 18:17.806
-Yeah.
-…to create a scary atmosphere.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.392
I have goose bumps. I have chills.

18:20.475 --> 18:23.812
Then Boober disappears into the fog.
I hoist Wembley up on this rake

18:23.896 --> 18:25.981
so he's a big, tall, scary monster.

18:27.191 --> 18:31.278
And then the Merggles are like,
"Where'd that pie guy go?"

18:31.361 --> 18:35.199
And then a big, tall, scary Wembley
appears out of the fog and says…

18:35.282 --> 18:36.658
I ate him!

18:38.118 --> 18:41.455
Bam! Hiccups gone, foolproof plan.
Okay, let's do this.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.088
Come on. Yeah.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.969
Oh, no. I dropped the foggies.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.097
Wait. Those aren't foggy fruit.

18:59.181 --> 19:02.226
-Wembley, what's going on?
-They're greaseberries!

19:09.358 --> 19:10.859
Oh, no.

19:15.405 --> 19:19.868
Oh, great. We were so bad at scaring them
that we made them laugh.

19:27.668 --> 19:31.046
Okay, Mokey. We know we messed up.
You don't have to laugh at us too.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.589
-Yeah.
-No, no. Guys, listen.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.967
Their hiccups are gone.

19:36.510 --> 19:37.678
You mean--

19:37.761 --> 19:40.389
-We did it!
-All right.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.850
We're totally cured, bros.

19:42.933 --> 19:46.395
You tried to force your plan,
and it didn't work.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.480
I've been doing the same thing with Red.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.440
But now look.

19:50.524 --> 19:54.278
You got where you wanted to go
in a totally unexpected way.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.657
Yes, thought bulb. That is a good idea.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.626
When I go left, you might go right

20:09.710 --> 20:13.130
But we'll get there in our own time

20:13.213 --> 20:16.633
And everyone should celebrate

20:16.717 --> 20:19.761
The things we learned along the way

20:19.845 --> 20:23.307
'Cause there's an infinite amount
Of paths to take

20:23.390 --> 20:26.935
And you could get there
In a million kinds of ways

20:27.019 --> 20:30.063
-Do-do-do-do
-It doesn't matter how you get there

20:30.147 --> 20:33.775
If you're going the same place

20:33.859 --> 20:35.694
-No two paths
-No two paths

20:35.777 --> 20:37.487
-Are the same
-Are the same

20:37.571 --> 20:39.781
No two paths

20:39.865 --> 20:41.366
Do-do-do-do-do

20:41.450 --> 20:44.870
You might think that you know best

20:44.953 --> 20:48.415
That everyone should follow
Step-by-step

20:48.498 --> 20:51.960
But remember what works for you

20:52.044 --> 20:55.339
Might not be right
In someone else's shoes

20:55.422 --> 20:58.592
'Cause there's an infinite amount
Of paths to take

20:58.675 --> 21:02.471
And you could get there
In a million kinds of ways

21:02.554 --> 21:05.390
-Do-do-do-do
-It doesn't matter how you get there

21:05.474 --> 21:08.894
If you're going the same place

21:08.977 --> 21:10.896
-No two paths
-No two paths

21:10.979 --> 21:12.731
-Are the same
-Are the same

21:12.814 --> 21:14.691
No two paths

21:14.775 --> 21:17.778
No two paths are the same

21:18.779 --> 21:20.280
I gotta go find Red.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.702
Don't worry. That was just a oner.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.459
Today has been a day.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.546
The solar panels keep shorting.

21:35.629 --> 21:38.423
Jar six was a bust.
Nothing's eating plastic.

21:38.507 --> 21:41.885
I don't know how I'm gonna do
more than I'm already doing.

21:44.263 --> 21:47.975
Can you please make one thing easy
and take your medicine?

21:49.142 --> 21:51.895
You know I don't have time
for whatever this is.

21:53.856 --> 21:55.983
Okay, fine.

21:57.985 --> 21:59.027
What now?

22:01.363 --> 22:02.865
I guess you're kinda cute.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.870
It feels good to slow down, huh?

22:12.791 --> 22:15.419
What, really? Now you're gonna take it?

22:16.086 --> 22:17.754
You just wanted a cuddle.

22:27.598 --> 22:28.682
Open up.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.644
That's my dog.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.440
I still can't believe
I wasted a block of cheese on you.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.066
You owe me some cheddar.

22:42.237 --> 22:44.448
Red, how are you doing?

22:44.531 --> 22:47.951
Bad. I'm doing very bad.

22:48.035 --> 22:49.703
Red, I'm sorry.

22:49.786 --> 22:54.416
I really wanted you to try meditation
because it works so well for me, and--

22:54.499 --> 22:56.710
and I think it could work for you.

22:56.793 --> 23:00.756
But it has to be your way, not mine.

23:00.839 --> 23:05.135
So if you ever want help finding that,
I'm here.

23:05.219 --> 23:07.054
I appreciate that, Mokey.

23:07.137 --> 23:11.308
But I don't think meditation is for me.

23:11.391 --> 23:15.521
I'm an action Fraggle.
That's how I clear my head.

23:15.604 --> 23:18.398
I like to dive headfirst, yell "whoopee,"

23:18.482 --> 23:23.028
and then hit that water
and let everything disappear.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.489
That sounds peaceful.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.573
It is.

23:26.657 --> 23:30.786
I love the water weaving through
my pigtails as I swirl in the currents.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.579
Yes.

23:32.663 --> 23:35.249
It feels like a warm hug.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.751
Huge hug fan over here.

23:53.308 --> 23:56.562
There's nothing better than this.

23:56.645 --> 23:57.980
Mind if I join you?

23:58.063 --> 23:59.982
I was hoping you would.

24:16.665 --> 24:19.585
Mokey, this is amazing.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.962
I totally feel like myself again.

24:22.713 --> 24:25.382
Red, I am so proud of you--

24:25.465 --> 24:27.092
I'm still in the zone.

24:27.176 --> 24:28.552
Sorry. Sorry.
