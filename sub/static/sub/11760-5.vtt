00:06.465 --> 00:10.145
- Whose idea is this anyway?
- Comes from the top, Constable. Come on.

00:14.545 --> 00:16.545
This way.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:40.905 --> 00:43.904
Bloody black magic.

00:43.905 --> 00:45.945
It's a sacrifice to the spirits.

00:57.905 --> 00:59.905
There.

01:01.505 --> 01:03.505
There.

01:19.385 --> 01:21.744
Water rushes in and floods
these sewers every day.

01:21.745 --> 01:24.185
If the girl's in here,
she's probably dead.

01:34.745 --> 01:36.944
Bloody hell!

01:36.945 --> 01:38.985
It's all right.

01:44.905 --> 01:48.025
I feel her. I feel her near.

02:02.305 --> 02:04.825
- Julia!
- Julia!
- There she is.

02:06.465 --> 02:08.465
Pull her out.

02:08.785 --> 02:10.785
Get her out. Come on.

02:16.785 --> 02:18.824
Momma!

02:18.825 --> 02:20.865
It's OK.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.864
- Ma, you look stunning.
- Thank you, precious.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.344
Which one do you prefer?

02:47.345 --> 02:50.505
As long as they're on you,
both are beautiful.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.664
I have luncheon plans.

02:54.665 --> 02:56.464
With a gentleman.

02:56.465 --> 02:59.224
- Great.
- Ehrie, don't be like this.

02:59.225 --> 03:01.024
What? I said "great".

03:01.025 --> 03:03.544
I'm just surprised.

03:03.545 --> 03:06.744
Your father has been gone
for a long time.

03:06.745 --> 03:10.064
I miss... company.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.105
Well, I'm company.

03:15.305 --> 03:18.064
- You're upset.
- No, I'm not upset.
It's just out of the blue.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.704
Who is this guy?
Where'd you meet him?

03:20.705 --> 03:22.824
All right, all right.

03:22.825 --> 03:25.784
Have a great time.

03:25.785 --> 03:29.024
Make sure he takes you to your
favourite restaurant.

03:29.025 --> 03:31.065
You know, the really expensive one.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.344
I thought you'd left.

03:57.345 --> 03:59.944
Off to Scotland Yard again
on one of your adventures.

03:59.945 --> 04:02.704
No adventures today.
Just good, solid work.

04:02.705 --> 04:04.704
Can you read it to me?

04:04.705 --> 04:07.745
- Ah...
- You can still read
to your daughter. I'm only 11.

04:15.665 --> 04:17.625
Did you like it?

04:21.785 --> 04:24.624
- What about this?
- Ugh.

04:24.625 --> 04:26.624
My book on the Boer War
is pretty ripping.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.504
Maybe you'd prefer that.

04:32.585 --> 04:34.585
Sorry, my love. Maybe another time.

04:35.625 --> 04:38.664
Yes. I suppose you've seen the paper.

04:38.665 --> 04:41.264
Uh, actually, no, not yet.

04:41.265 --> 04:43.305
Oh. Never mind.

04:49.945 --> 04:52.384
So our young Constable Stratton
is married.

04:52.385 --> 04:54.144
When was she going to tell us that?

04:54.145 --> 04:55.984
I can't see that it's our business.

04:55.985 --> 04:59.184
And you only know because I told
you, so keep it to yourself.

04:59.185 --> 05:00.968
How can she be married?
She had dinner with me.

05:00.970 --> 05:03.664
- That's got to mean something.
- It means she was hungry.

05:03.665 --> 05:05.584
I presume you're here
about Madam Korzha?

05:05.585 --> 05:10.304
I was shocked Merring agreed to let her help. He
seemed desperate. A very strange move for Merring.

05:10.305 --> 05:13.624
Perhaps we convinced him there's no
shortage of paranormal help -

05:13.625 --> 05:17.344
- Of con artists or knuckle-dragging
idiots who believe them.
- Oh, bloody hell.

05:17.345 --> 05:21.304
Sergeant Gudgett, we were just talking about
you. And you too, if you buy into this?

05:21.305 --> 05:23.264
It was refreshing to have a consultant

05:23.265 --> 05:26.064
who wasn't in it merely to
glorify their own ego.

05:26.065 --> 05:29.104
We are most grateful for your help.

05:29.105 --> 05:30.864
It was an honour to have served.

05:30.865 --> 05:35.624
I've been fortunate enough to reunite
people with missing possessions

05:35.625 --> 05:38.264
but to save a child...
it is a blessing.

05:38.265 --> 05:42.184
Mm. It gives you a leg up finding things
when you were the one that hid them.

05:42.185 --> 05:45.024
Are you accusing her?
I didn't know I was being subtle.

05:45.025 --> 05:50.144
I admit, sir, the idea that the spirits
found the girl seems... dubious.

05:50.145 --> 05:52.705
Oh, good, a rational member
of Scotland Yard.

05:55.305 --> 05:57.704
Interesting.

05:57.705 --> 06:02.104
Forgive my friends, Madam Korzha. We
are all very grateful for your help.

06:02.105 --> 06:06.744
"If my record were closed tonight I
could still survey it with equanimity."

06:06.745 --> 06:09.104
That's a Holmes story.

06:09.105 --> 06:12.584
He was such a vivid character,
so poetic.

06:12.585 --> 06:14.664
I was sad when he died,

06:14.665 --> 06:17.384
but I suppose you can only do
the same thing for so long.

06:17.385 --> 06:19.904
I imagine this has given you
the freedom

06:19.905 --> 06:22.984
to write newer things.
- Absolutely.

06:22.985 --> 06:26.224
Did you find him yet? Did you find the
man who murdered my little girl?!

06:26.225 --> 06:28.785
- Calm down, sir.
- Give me five minutes with him.

06:30.545 --> 06:35.104
I'm sorry, Mr Pearce. We didn't
manage to catch the perpetrator.

06:35.105 --> 06:40.104
But, Madam Korzha here was able to
help us locate Julia Hargreaves.

06:40.105 --> 06:42.785
So she didn't suffer the same fate
as your Emily.

06:46.385 --> 06:48.385
So he's still out there?

06:50.305 --> 06:52.464
She was all I had.

06:52.465 --> 06:54.865
Please, please.
He took everything from me!

07:00.465 --> 07:02.384
Was that Mitchell Pearce?

07:02.385 --> 07:05.064
Tragic story. Widower.
Took an extra shift

07:05.065 --> 07:07.584
on the docks one night
and his daughter was kidnapped.

07:07.585 --> 07:10.145
We found her in Shoreditch...
in a water tank.

07:12.145 --> 07:17.064
Now another eight-year-old girl, another
attempted drowning. Almost a year to the day.

07:17.065 --> 07:20.384
Did the perpetrator leave this
"No Innocence" message last year?

07:20.385 --> 07:24.544
No, that seems to be an escalation.
But the modus operandi is the same.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.785
For the time being, we should
consider the crimes linked.

07:28.985 --> 07:33.224
Madam Korzha... With the help of the
spirits, I will do everything I can.

07:33.225 --> 07:37.264
- The psychic's on the case?
- There's a lunatic out there
trying to kill children.

07:37.265 --> 07:39.264
We need all the help we can get
on this one.

07:39.265 --> 07:41.305
So, the psychic's on the case.

07:44.345 --> 07:46.345
So are you.

07:48.305 --> 07:50.744
If Korzha's the kidnapper,

07:50.745 --> 07:53.544
wouldn't that mean she's also
Emily Pearce's killer?

07:53.545 --> 07:55.704
Merring thinks it's the same
perpetrator.

07:55.705 --> 07:58.504
Merring's wrong.
The girl was never going to die.

07:58.505 --> 08:01.304
If she did, Korzha couldn't
"find" her and get paid.

08:01.305 --> 08:05.704
Why "No Innocence"? What does that
mean? A message for the parents?

08:05.705 --> 08:07.864
- Why "No Innocence"? What does that.
- Perhaps.

08:07.865 --> 08:09.584
- Why "No Innocence"? What does that.
- They may have had enemies.

08:09.585 --> 08:12.904
- This is our stop.
- No, it isn't.

08:12.905 --> 08:16.185
Yeah, I'm investigating a second
matter. I need your help.

08:30.865 --> 08:34.464
You brought us here to spy
on your mother? Yeah.

08:34.465 --> 08:37.864
- What do you think is going on there?
- My instincts tell me...

08:37.865 --> 08:40.424
she's having lunch.
With a man.

08:40.424 --> 08:42.864
Clearly my detective skills
are no match for yours.

08:42.865 --> 08:45.624
- Could be a gold digger.
- Doesn't look like he needs her money.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.704
- That's an expensive suit he's wearing.
- Going from woman to woman,

08:48.705 --> 08:53.945
spending their money. What if he's trying to shake
her down? - What if he's a perfectly nice man?

08:54.865 --> 08:58.144
Go talk to them. Just go, go.
Find out who he is.

08:58.145 --> 09:01.584
- You're a cop, you can ask
whatever you want.
- Are you mad?

09:01.585 --> 09:03.504
I need to know my mother's OK.

09:03.505 --> 09:05.264
She's fine. Listen to yourself.

09:05.265 --> 09:07.144
What an excellent use of our time.

09:07.145 --> 09:10.264
- I'm worried about my mother.
- Poppycock. You're being selfish.

09:10.265 --> 09:13.624
- Loving my mother is selfish?
- Monopolising her love is.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.144
What if she falls for this man?
What if she marries him?

09:16.145 --> 09:19.704
She's ready been married,
when she was much younger.

09:19.705 --> 09:23.824
Around your age, Adelaide.
You ever think about getting married?

09:23.825 --> 09:26.544
I make it a rule to never discuss
my personal life

09:26.545 --> 09:28.705
with anyone hiding from their mother.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.265
Well done.

09:39.905 --> 09:43.504
Physically Julia's fine but
she's still suffering from shock.

09:43.505 --> 09:46.144
It may be a while before she wakes up.

09:46.145 --> 09:49.424
Poor thing. Hypovolaemia
from the blood loss?

09:49.425 --> 09:53.264
That's the strange thing.
I can't find a single cut on her.

09:53.265 --> 09:56.184
I thought that "No Innocence"
message was written in blood.

09:56.185 --> 09:58.225
Not Julia's.

10:02.985 --> 10:06.344
I'm Constable Stratton.
This is Dr Doyle and Mr Houdini.

10:06.345 --> 10:08.344
We are so sorry for what has happened.

10:08.345 --> 10:11.104
We're just glad she's safe.
We owe Madam Korzha everything.

10:11.105 --> 10:13.624
I'm sure they'll get an invoice for
close to that.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.184
Have you had any experience
of psychics before?

10:16.185 --> 10:19.264
No. The police told us
she came to them.

10:19.265 --> 10:22.584
Is there any reason the kidnapper
might have targeted your daughter?

10:22.585 --> 10:24.744
Did someone want to hurt your family?

10:24.745 --> 10:26.784
No.

10:26.785 --> 10:28.825
I can't think of anyone.

10:31.545 --> 10:33.744
Is it possible she went willingly?

10:33.745 --> 10:37.504
- Willingly?
- Maybe whoever kidnapped
her seemed safe.

10:37.505 --> 10:41.584
- A woman, perhaps?
- Whoever it was
might have coaxed Julia.

10:41.585 --> 10:43.744
Perhaps with lollies or toys?

10:43.745 --> 10:45.785
Well, that might explain the doll.

10:47.385 --> 10:49.384
This isn't hers?

10:49.385 --> 10:51.944
We'd never seen it before.

10:53.705 --> 10:56.944
Yes? Constable Stratton,

10:56.945 --> 11:00.824
Madam Korzha needs to see
the three of you immediately.

11:00.825 --> 11:03.304
He was here, on this very path.

11:03.305 --> 11:06.304
How do you know?
I feel the echoes.

11:06.305 --> 11:09.144
Madam Korzha, when did you
discover these abilities?

11:09.145 --> 11:13.824
When I was a girl, I felt
something beckoning to me.

11:13.825 --> 11:16.504
At first I didn't want to believe it.

11:16.505 --> 11:21.184
But when I opened myself up to the
spirits, they began to speak,

11:21.185 --> 11:23.225
to show me things.

11:31.465 --> 11:33.425
It is a gift...

11:42.425 --> 11:44.425
...and a curse.

11:56.905 --> 11:58.905
This way.

12:19.585 --> 12:21.584
I feel her.

12:21.585 --> 12:23.625
The girl was here.

12:32.745 --> 12:34.745
Hm.

12:41.025 --> 12:43.224
A disguise?

12:43.225 --> 12:45.265
The kidnapper's tools?

12:47.385 --> 12:50.465
Hm. Smells like sewage.

12:52.865 --> 12:56.504
Look at this.

12:56.505 --> 12:58.545
It's identical to the one Julia had.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.144
I admit, that was remarkable.

13:08.145 --> 13:11.744
What's remarkable? Our kidnapper
deduced where the kidnapper was.

13:11.745 --> 13:15.264
If she's truly the culprit, why lead us
to a place that could prove her guilt?

13:15.265 --> 13:18.464
If she's truly a psychic, why
couldn't she lead us to kidnapper?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.344
No-one said she has all the answers.

13:20.345 --> 13:23.304
There's a spectrum of things
the human mind can perceive.

13:23.305 --> 13:25.784
What if psychics are further along
that spectrum,

13:25.785 --> 13:28.144
like dogs are sensitive
to high-pitched sounds?

13:28.145 --> 13:29.904
Like dogs are sensitive
You believe in dogs, don't you?

13:29.905 --> 13:31.744
It was Korzha.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.384
We know it wasn't Julia's blood.

13:34.385 --> 13:38.264
And who do we know who enjoys spilling
their own blood for dramatic effect?

13:38.265 --> 13:41.064
There's no psychopathic kidnapper
roaming the streets.

13:41.065 --> 13:44.344
Just a very talented con artist.

13:44.345 --> 13:46.905
- Chief Inspector?
- Another girl's been taken.

13:53.215 --> 13:55.494
- She woke less than an hour ago.
- Is she all right?

13:55.495 --> 13:58.014
Anything she can tell us
would be hugely helpful.

13:58.015 --> 14:01.894
Another eight-year-old girl has been
abducted, we believe by the same person.

14:01.895 --> 14:05.134
She appears to be fine
but it's tough to say.

14:05.135 --> 14:09.175
She won't talk to me.
She won't talk to any man.

14:10.775 --> 14:14.494
Julia, dear, is there anything you can
remember about who took you away?

14:14.495 --> 14:17.214
I couldn't see his face.

14:17.215 --> 14:20.254
He was wearing a funny mask.

14:20.255 --> 14:22.774
He gave me a doll to play with.

14:22.775 --> 14:26.374
He put something over my eyes

14:26.375 --> 14:28.494
and he took me somewhere.

14:28.495 --> 14:30.535
It was cold.

14:32.815 --> 14:35.334
Julia, was there a woman there?

14:35.335 --> 14:37.814
No.

14:37.815 --> 14:39.854
He had a beard.

14:39.855 --> 14:42.214
What?
I thought he was wearing a mask.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.214
- What?
- He must've taken it off.

14:45.215 --> 14:47.255
I scratched him and he had a beard.

14:52.895 --> 14:54.614
Well?

14:54.615 --> 14:56.694
Kidnapper has a beard.
Small world.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.494
Korzha's assistant, Henri,
also has a beard.

14:59.495 --> 15:02.294
So does Mr Hargreaves.

15:02.295 --> 15:04.934
If she went willingly, it may
have been someone she knew.

15:04.935 --> 15:08.694
- Does Hargreaves have a connection to
the latest victim, Helena Wood?
- Don't know.

15:08.695 --> 15:12.174
Forget the latest victim. Why would
a father want to kill his own child?

15:12.175 --> 15:15.054
If it's a madman,
rational thought may not apply.

15:15.055 --> 15:20.614
You never know what can make someone
snap. Does the father have an alibi?

15:20.615 --> 15:24.614
According to Mr Hargreaves, he and his
wife were attending a play at Wyndham's.

15:24.615 --> 15:27.414
- We can look into that, sir.
- I'll see to it personally.

15:27.415 --> 15:31.294
And post a man at the hospital. The girl
is not to be left alone with her father.

15:31.295 --> 15:34.054
And Korzha?
Is she free to walk around?

15:34.055 --> 15:36.814
I'll put her under surveillance.

15:36.815 --> 15:39.215
We can see to that one, personally.

15:51.335 --> 15:54.134
I hear a man's voice.

15:54.135 --> 15:56.214
Yes.

15:56.215 --> 15:58.774
She's wearing a very expensive coat,
but it's old.

15:58.775 --> 16:01.974
Husband died two or three years ago -
she still wears the ring -

16:01.975 --> 16:05.174
but the money ran dry. A broke widow.

16:05.175 --> 16:08.494
Your husband,
he passed a few years ago.

16:08.495 --> 16:10.454
He did.

16:10.455 --> 16:12.294
It was so sudden.

16:12.295 --> 16:15.574
He wants you to know
he is sorry he left.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.214
He misses you dearly.

16:18.215 --> 16:23.374
And he knows life is difficult
right now...

16:23.375 --> 16:27.054
but... it will get better.

16:27.055 --> 16:29.095
She's very skilled.

16:33.175 --> 16:35.334
Dr Doyle.

16:35.335 --> 16:37.494
Your wife is here

16:37.495 --> 16:39.534
and she wishes to speak through me.

16:39.535 --> 16:42.774
Ladies and gentlemen, when a spirit
wishes to communicate this way

16:42.775 --> 16:46.494
we must summon them through
the mystical art of the seance.

16:46.495 --> 16:49.055
You are to bear witness
to a remarkable event.

16:54.135 --> 16:56.135
No fake table levitation.

16:58.735 --> 17:00.935
And no ringing bells
with your toes, OK?

17:02.655 --> 17:05.334
If we're going to do this,
we need to set some conditions.

17:05.335 --> 17:07.375
What conditions?

17:12.335 --> 17:17.654
You must open your minds...
and your hearts,

17:17.655 --> 17:21.773
that we may reach the spirits who
have crossed over into the unknown,

17:21.775 --> 17:23.815
who guide us in this world.

17:39.095 --> 17:41.734
Arthur.

17:41.735 --> 17:45.135
Arthur, my darling.

17:47.855 --> 17:52.895
She says... her time is not up.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.734
Your wife has not passed.

17:58.735 --> 18:00.775
No, she hasn't.

18:12.055 --> 18:15.894
Don't grieve, Arthur, my love.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.935
Touie is still with you.

18:27.975 --> 18:29.975
Thank you.

18:36.415 --> 18:39.454
Folks, this lady is just trying
to separate you from your cash.

18:55.055 --> 18:57.254
I tied him myself and it was your idea.

18:57.255 --> 19:00.054
How could they prepare for that?
It's a multiple out principle.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.095
If it is a trick, how is it done?

19:05.135 --> 19:07.014
Oh, you're not buying into this,
are you?

19:07.015 --> 19:09.814
Well, either you're right and
she's kidnapped Helena Wood

19:09.815 --> 19:11.694
or you're wrong and we need her help.

19:11.695 --> 19:13.734
Another girl is missing?
Yes.

19:13.735 --> 19:18.134
So if the spirits really
can help you, let them.

19:18.135 --> 19:20.614
So if the spirits really I will try.

19:20.615 --> 19:23.375
But they do not always give us
the answers we seek.

19:27.735 --> 19:30.454
- What, no dramatic lighting this time?
- Shh.

19:30.455 --> 19:36.494
I see. By the stroke of midnight
she will be no more.

19:36.495 --> 19:39.254
Helena Wood?

19:39.255 --> 19:41.134
No...

19:41.135 --> 19:43.175
Adelaide Stratton.

19:49.162 --> 19:52.639
- It doesn't mean anything.
- Every prediction Madam Korzha
made has come true.

19:52.641 --> 19:55.999
- Now she says Adelaide's in danger.
- Why say that? Because we're onto her.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.999
She's distracting us. We're arguing
instead of arresting her.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.759
- We need to protect Adelaide.
- We?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.519
Do I get a say in this?

20:02.520 --> 20:04.399
I was just trying to help you.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.759
I'm a police constable
of Scotland Yard.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.559
I don't need saving.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.960
If you want to help me,
let me do my job.

20:12.280 --> 20:15.080
- Charing Cross is not for two more stops.
- I'll walk.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.519
Yeah, could've told you
that would happen.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.559
I've forgotten how well you knew women.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.199
Of all the psychics and mediums
I've ever visited,

20:27.200 --> 20:29.879
Korzha's the only one who knew
my wife was still alive.

20:29.880 --> 20:33.319
And none of them knew
that I called her Touie.

20:33.320 --> 20:37.759
When she made contact, I felt
this... this sudden chill.

20:37.760 --> 20:41.119
In that moment, I felt my wife
was communicating with me.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.719
I don't expect you to understand
but I felt something.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.760
I know.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.679
There was an incredible psychic who used
to work carnivals in the north-east.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.559
There was an incredible psychic One night,
he contacted this woman's husband for her.

20:59.560 --> 21:04.639
The husband sang the first song
from their wedding,

21:04.640 --> 21:06.680
said he'd never let go.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.639
But then things started to go bad.

21:09.640 --> 21:13.559
The woman started neglecting her
children, refused to move on,

21:13.560 --> 21:16.120
because she knew her husband
was still there.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.799
A month later, she killed herself...

21:21.800 --> 21:23.840
so she could finally be with him.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.239
I was the psychic.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.159
It was all part of my act.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.120
And that woman, she believed it all,
right to her end.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.679
Harry...

21:39.680 --> 21:42.639
my wife is ill
but she's still in there.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.239
I'm not looking to run away
from anything.

21:45.240 --> 21:50.879
But you - your father's dead and
your mother's whole life is you.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.999
You feel safe with her
but she has a life to live,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.040
with you and without you.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.640
- Where are you going?
- To put an end to Korzha's con.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.959
Hell of a show you pulled.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.719
Top notch.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.519
Where's your boyfriend?

22:24.520 --> 22:26.839
Henri and I are not lovers.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.479
Just partners in crime then, huh?

22:29.480 --> 22:33.039
I've seen a lot of the tricksters
in whose company you think I belong.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.639
I'm not one of them. You really
think I'd kidnap those girls?

22:37.640 --> 22:40.719
Yes.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.639
No. You're not sure.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.919
Don't cold read me.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.960
- Where's that girl?
- I don't know.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.119
You're hiding something.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.239
We all are.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.679
I don't have anything to hide.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.320
Yes, you do. You're afraid
of losing someone.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.320
- The spirits tell you that?
- Mm-hm.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.400
What are they telling you now?

23:25.580 --> 23:29.619
- Thank goodness you're back.
- Didn't think I could make it
half a mile on my own?

23:29.620 --> 23:32.500
I don't need protection
from a writer or a magician.

23:35.460 --> 23:37.619
So what happens at midnight?

23:37.620 --> 23:39.459
Korzha hasn't been wrong yet.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.779
There's a first time
for everything, right?

23:42.780 --> 23:48.259
I want to believe in Korzha because
it means that maybe when I'm gone,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.300
I can still watch over my children.

23:52.980 --> 23:55.259
I want that more than anything
in the world,

23:55.260 --> 23:57.700
but that doesn't mean that
Korzha is right.

24:00.380 --> 24:03.619
I can't imagine what it must
be like to lose a child.

24:03.620 --> 24:05.660
It must be utter agony.

24:11.300 --> 24:13.300
Am I right?

24:16.620 --> 24:19.659
My son, Will.

24:19.660 --> 24:21.700
Last year.

24:25.020 --> 24:27.220
Hargreaves' alibi has been confirmed.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.459
So he's not our kidnapper.

24:30.460 --> 24:34.019
- Sir...
- Sometimes I feel completely lost.

24:34.020 --> 24:36.939
Blind with rage.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.379
But that won't bring him back.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.939
It's a tragedy.

24:41.940 --> 24:45.459
It's a tragedy that should never
have happened.

24:45.460 --> 24:48.219
He died in this Boer War

24:48.220 --> 24:51.379
you've defended so eloquently.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.420
Find that little girl.

24:58.860 --> 25:01.579
Well, that was unexpected.

25:01.580 --> 25:05.259
You seem peaceful.
Peaceful?

25:05.260 --> 25:08.179
I suppose.

25:08.180 --> 25:10.979
A peaceful mind is an open mind.

25:10.980 --> 25:13.020
Not that peaceful.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.419
I hope you don't feel
I've taken advantage of you.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.460
No. No, of course not.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.900
Wait, you taking advantage of me?

25:25.300 --> 25:28.460
I'm a passionate woman.
It's in my blood.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.260
I have urges and sometimes
I act on them.

25:41.220 --> 25:45.099
- What did you find?
- Ruffled shirt,
flecks of eye make-up on collar,

25:45.100 --> 25:48.339
hair uncoifed.
I think we know what he found.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.859
So you're allowed to spend time
with the opposite sex

25:50.860 --> 25:53.579
but your mother is not, is that right?

25:53.580 --> 25:57.299
- It was a one-time thing.
- If your mother just wanted
to have a one-time thing -

25:57.300 --> 25:59.579
This is not about my mother.

25:59.580 --> 26:01.339
It's about the case.

26:01.340 --> 26:03.379
You stole her passport.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.339
I prefer the term 'lifted'.

26:05.340 --> 26:07.619
It sounds more skilful.

26:07.620 --> 26:10.459
So, just to be clear,

26:10.460 --> 26:12.419
you thought Korzha
might be a kidnapper,

26:12.420 --> 26:14.219
and you just went to bed with her.

26:14.220 --> 26:15.979
A sacrifice I had to make.

26:15.980 --> 26:20.699
The first girl was taken on the fourth.
Korzha cleared customs on the sixth.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.179
Doesn't that prove it wasn't Korzha?

26:23.180 --> 26:26.579
Well, it's possible Henri
did the dirty work.

26:26.580 --> 26:30.099
Yeah. Not being in the same country
is a pretty solid alibi.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.579
That alibi might not be so solid.

26:33.580 --> 26:35.620
This is fake.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.700
Oh, it's you.

27:03.460 --> 27:05.460
What do you know about this?

27:10.820 --> 27:12.819
Don't know nothing.

27:12.820 --> 27:14.699
Nah.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.339
Give us a tenner.
I don't have £10.

27:17.340 --> 27:20.099
- Well, then I don't know nothing.
- What if she arrests you?

27:20.100 --> 27:21.819
She ain't gonna arrest me.

27:21.820 --> 27:25.339
Fips is trying to help.
We don't arrest people for that.

27:25.340 --> 27:30.739
Too right. Besides, I'll bet the
Great Houdini's got ten quid.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.579
He's always flashing his cash.

27:32.580 --> 27:34.940
Come on, Harry, pay the man.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.739
She's good.

27:42.740 --> 27:45.339
Over to you then, Arthur.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.380
Would you take five?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.339
Edith Pilkie?

27:50.340 --> 27:53.419
Our Romanian psychic is really
Edith Pilkie from Croydon?

27:53.420 --> 27:55.219
Her alibi is completely gone.

27:55.220 --> 27:57.659
Just because she was here,
doesn't mean she did it.

27:57.660 --> 28:01.499
She's a fraud. She's literally
not who she says she was.

28:01.500 --> 28:05.099
She changed her name for effect.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.140
That's not a crime, is it, Erich?

28:12.100 --> 28:14.100
The ropes.

28:15.340 --> 28:17.340
The ropes!

28:19.820 --> 28:21.820
It's all about the ropes.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.700
The first kidnapper,
a year ago he used simple knots.

28:29.260 --> 28:32.099
She almost untied one.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.819
The second kidnapper's knots
are way more complicated.

28:34.820 --> 28:37.179
Whoever tied these was an ordinary
criminal.

28:37.180 --> 28:39.339
Whoever tied these was a rope expert.

28:39.340 --> 28:43.899
So the Emily Pearce and Julia Hargreaves
kidnappings were not committed by the same person.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.979
That, by the way, is how the
switching trick was accomplished.

28:46.980 --> 28:48.779
Henri used a Kellar Rope Tie,

28:48.780 --> 28:51.819
positioning himself exactly how
he wanted when you tied him up.

28:51.820 --> 28:53.499
Everything else was misdirection.

28:53.500 --> 28:58.019
That's how he untied himself and switched places
with Korzha so quickly. It's a beautiful trick.

28:58.020 --> 29:00.579
Only a couple of experts
would know how to pull that off.

29:00.580 --> 29:03.740
And we are looking for a rope
expert. Yes, but not Korzha.

29:19.180 --> 29:21.819
You lot. Have you found
the kidnapper?

29:21.820 --> 29:25.139
We are working very hard on that,
sir, and we could use your help.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.099
My help?

29:27.100 --> 29:30.179
Well, I don't know anything.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.659
Hey! What are you bothering me for?

29:32.660 --> 29:34.700
There's a madman out there.

29:36.260 --> 29:39.539
I can only imagine what it's like
to lose a child, Mr Pearce.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.659
But we can see what it did to you.

29:41.660 --> 29:44.299
When you heard that Julia Hargreaves
had been rescued,

29:44.300 --> 29:46.179
you knew she might identify you.

29:46.180 --> 29:49.779
Your visit to Scotland Yard wasn't to
see if the kidnapper had been caught -

29:49.780 --> 29:51.779
it was to make sure
you weren't a suspect.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.819
Julia Hargreaves couldn't
see your face,

29:53.820 --> 29:56.819
but she knew her kidnapper
was a man with a beard,

29:56.820 --> 29:59.139
so you shaved yours off.

29:59.140 --> 30:01.180
Which was a gamble.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.779
Keeping the beard might
have made you a suspect,

30:04.780 --> 30:07.299
but it also could've hidden this.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.459
It might've passed as a shaving cut,

30:09.460 --> 30:13.259
but it was where Julia Hargreaves scratched
you as you carried her into the sewer.

30:13.260 --> 30:15.139
You discarded the mask and your tools,

30:15.140 --> 30:17.339
but you couldn't get rid
of that scratch.

30:17.340 --> 30:20.259
You recreated the circumstances
of your daughter's tragedy,

30:20.260 --> 30:22.779
but you added a message
written in your own blood.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.419
And when you bound Julia's wrists,

30:25.420 --> 30:29.379
you used knots that could only be tied
by a rope expert, an expert like you.

30:29.380 --> 30:32.099
A docker.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.739
What did your message mean, Mr Pearce?

30:34.740 --> 30:36.780
What did you mean by "No Innocence"?

30:41.500 --> 30:44.339
Madam Korzha?
The spirits sent me.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.380
They are never wrong -
he's the one.

30:48.860 --> 30:50.899
There's no innocence left
in this world.

30:50.900 --> 30:54.059
It's gone, just like my little girl.

30:54.060 --> 30:57.820
We're all guilty and we all
deserve whatever we get.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.499
It's not too late, Mitchell.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.779
My baby was only eight...

31:04.780 --> 31:06.659
and no-one cared.

31:06.660 --> 31:10.339
Coppers never found who did it.
Forgot all about it.

31:10.340 --> 31:12.700
But I got people thinking
about her again.

31:14.860 --> 31:17.219
You need to tell us
where Helena Wood is.

31:17.220 --> 31:20.539
Revisiting your pain on someone
else is not the answer.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.580
No? Maybe then they'll understand.

31:25.780 --> 31:27.780
I understand.

31:30.540 --> 31:33.299
I lost someone once.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.340
My husband.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.739
I loved him more than life.

31:40.740 --> 31:44.739
Losing him nearly destroyed me.

31:44.740 --> 31:49.459
It's like having your heart ripped
out, every second of every day.

31:49.460 --> 31:52.579
You have to fight, Mitchell.

31:52.580 --> 31:55.540
You have to fight not to lose
the battle for your soul.

32:02.260 --> 32:04.260
It's too late for that.

32:08.980 --> 32:10.980
Adelaide!

32:14.060 --> 32:16.260
Where is she, Pearce?
Where's the girl?

32:20.140 --> 32:22.180
- It wasn't me. I wasn't hit.
- Thank God.

32:25.620 --> 32:27.620
He's dead.

32:29.635 --> 32:33.234
The girl could be anywhere. There are
a million ways to drown a person.

32:33.235 --> 32:35.275
- Can you help us?
- What?!

32:36.595 --> 32:39.594
She's been right about everything,
including finding Pearce.

32:39.595 --> 32:41.314
She might be right about me, too,

32:41.315 --> 32:43.754
but right now Helena Wood
is out there, dying.

32:43.755 --> 32:47.154
- Please help us. I'll try.
- Let's look at what we know.

32:47.155 --> 32:50.034
If Madam Korzha hadn't led
the police to Julia Hargreaves,

32:50.035 --> 32:53.674
she would've drowned just as Pearce's
daughter drowned in a water tank.

32:53.675 --> 32:56.754
Scotland Yard checked the tank in
Shoreditch. It's empty.

32:56.755 --> 32:59.114
And Gudgett's had bobbies
all over the sewers.

32:59.115 --> 33:02.074
Turned off half the water in London,
but they didn't find a thing.

33:02.075 --> 33:04.834
There has to be a common denominator.

33:04.835 --> 33:06.594
I see water.

33:06.595 --> 33:09.714
Brilliant. Our killer's MO is
drowning and she defines "water".

33:09.715 --> 33:11.994
No, the water is rising.

33:11.995 --> 33:13.794
The water is rising.

33:13.795 --> 33:17.474
Pearce's daughter - the water literally
rose around her in the tank.

33:17.475 --> 33:21.234
Julia Hargreaves would've died in the
sewer. The water would have swallowed her.

33:21.235 --> 33:23.274
Where could Pearce have placed
Helena Wood

33:23.275 --> 33:25.914
so the water would drown
her? What else would do that?

33:25.915 --> 33:27.834
The tides.

33:27.835 --> 33:30.634
Was the name of the company
Pearce worked for?

33:30.635 --> 33:33.115
Hurry up, lads.
No time to waste.

33:36.195 --> 33:38.195
Look for it there.
This way!

33:45.555 --> 33:47.194
Do a right down there.

33:47.195 --> 33:49.235
This way.

33:54.835 --> 33:57.874
Houdini!

33:57.875 --> 34:00.154
Do you see anything, you lot?

34:00.155 --> 34:02.155
Nothing?

34:23.995 --> 34:25.714
Helena!

34:29.355 --> 34:31.634
This way!

34:31.635 --> 34:33.675
We need a knife.

34:45.554 --> 34:47.514
You're going to be fine, sweetheart.

34:47.514 --> 34:49.554
OK? You're gonna be fine.

34:55.114 --> 34:57.114
Help.

35:07.995 --> 35:09.995
Piece of cake. Almost done.

35:13.115 --> 35:15.115
Be brave, Helena.

35:23.835 --> 35:25.554
When the water comes up to your nose,

35:25.555 --> 35:27.514
I need you to hold your breath, OK?

35:27.515 --> 35:29.875
You hold your breath
for as long as you can!

35:43.635 --> 35:45.635
Harry!

35:51.755 --> 35:54.434
Can you see her in the water?

35:54.435 --> 35:56.834
Is the girl down there, sir?

35:56.835 --> 35:59.234
- Do you see anything?
- Harry!

35:59.235 --> 36:01.275
Harry!

36:13.275 --> 36:16.194
- Is she alive?
- Harry, hurry! Fetch an ambulance!

36:16.195 --> 36:18.235
Someone get an ambulance!

36:18.915 --> 36:21.354
Careful. Careful, careful.

36:21.355 --> 36:23.634
Help him up, help him up.

36:23.635 --> 36:25.474
That's it, get 'em up.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.314
There we go. Lay her down here.

36:27.315 --> 36:30.114
Make room, make room.
Get out of the way.

36:30.115 --> 36:32.194
- Is she all right?
- She's not breathing.

36:32.195 --> 36:34.235
Move.

37:00.915 --> 37:02.915
I work with water a lot.

37:20.555 --> 37:22.874
The girl's parents are on their way.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.875
Pearce... we let him down.

37:27.635 --> 37:30.714
We let the insane kidnapper down?

37:30.715 --> 37:32.875
His child's killer is still out there.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.875
How could he not go mad?

37:41.715 --> 37:45.274
Chief Inspector, perhaps
you'd like to meet the girl?

37:45.275 --> 37:47.315
Thank you, Constable.

37:52.275 --> 37:54.795
You're quite a brave little girl,
aren't you?

37:56.395 --> 37:59.474
We owe the spirit our gratitude.

37:59.475 --> 38:01.234
I wish I could believe that.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.994
Even you now question my powers?

38:02.995 --> 38:06.274
You do indeed have powers,
Madam Korzha. Powers of detection.

38:06.275 --> 38:09.634
You solve crimes
by following the clues.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.234
Somehow you discovered the doll
factory and the gloves,

38:12.235 --> 38:16.474
which smelled like sewage, leading you
and the police right to the girl.

38:16.475 --> 38:19.794
Sherlock Holmes
wasn't entertainment for you.

38:19.795 --> 38:21.874
Those stories where your textbooks.

38:21.875 --> 38:24.034
Whether through bribery
or some other means,

38:24.035 --> 38:26.754
you borrowed the same police
photographs we were using.

38:26.755 --> 38:29.354
Using your knowledge of ropes,
you analysed the knots

38:29.355 --> 38:32.074
and deduced that Pearce
was the culprit.

38:32.075 --> 38:34.114
You went to his house,
searching for a clue

38:34.115 --> 38:37.755
as to where he'd taken Helena,
but he came home and surprised you.

38:40.475 --> 38:44.994
There's a distinct set of finger
prints on these photographs.

38:44.995 --> 38:47.274
A perfect match for...

38:47.275 --> 38:49.315
Edith Pilkie.

38:53.355 --> 38:55.394
You'd have been proud.

38:55.395 --> 38:57.674
I found boot prints.

38:57.675 --> 39:00.194
Near Julia's school there
was a set of small prints,

39:00.195 --> 39:02.594
joined by a set of big prints.

39:02.595 --> 39:04.434
Led me all the way to the factory.

39:04.435 --> 39:07.234
I smelled the gloves and found
the nearest manhole.

39:07.235 --> 39:10.714
Couldn't open it without some help,
so I went to the coppers.

39:10.715 --> 39:12.834
Can't believe you matched
my fingerprints.

39:12.835 --> 39:17.234
Actually, I didn't. That would've
been a very painstaking process.

39:17.235 --> 39:19.994
Brilliant.

39:19.995 --> 39:22.354
I figured out the rope thing.
Hm.

39:22.355 --> 39:24.875
- I figured out the rope thing.
- More than just a pretty face.

39:26.675 --> 39:28.675
I really wanted to believe in you.

39:31.475 --> 39:35.114
I admit, I can't contact
the spirits of the dead.

39:35.115 --> 39:37.474
But that doesn't mean
they're not out there.

39:37.475 --> 39:39.715
But that doesn't mean
I've seen things, I've felt them.

39:41.315 --> 39:46.035
Maybe they're trying to get through and we
just haven't figured out how to answer yet.

39:48.355 --> 39:51.435
Arthur, what you felt was real.

39:59.475 --> 40:04.154
Why did you say Adelaide
would be no more by midnight?

40:04.155 --> 40:06.794
Did you really believe
she was in danger?

40:06.795 --> 40:08.955
Or were you just trying to distract us?

40:20.755 --> 40:23.075
The facts might be met
speciously enough.

40:39.715 --> 40:42.274
Edith...

40:42.275 --> 40:44.315
how did you know my wife's nickname?

40:46.595 --> 40:48.595
It just came to me.

41:18.515 --> 41:21.674
I saw you at the restaurant.

41:21.675 --> 41:24.234
You don't want me to see him.

41:24.235 --> 41:26.275
I don't. I didn't.

41:27.595 --> 41:29.595
Look, Ma.

41:32.275 --> 41:34.275
You're all I have.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.394
I need you.

41:39.395 --> 41:41.714
But I'm OK.

41:41.715 --> 41:43.554
You have my permission.

41:43.555 --> 41:46.674
- Your permission?
- My blessing.

41:46.675 --> 41:50.674
I'm not going to stand in your way.
Just...

41:50.675 --> 41:52.715
- don't forget about me.
- Ehrie.

42:01.635 --> 42:03.994
I told him, no more.

42:03.995 --> 42:07.354
What? You didn't have to do that.

42:07.355 --> 42:09.514
You and I have each other.

42:09.515 --> 42:11.555
We don't need anyone else.

42:29.235 --> 42:31.235
Sorry I woke you, darling.

42:42.195 --> 42:45.435
'The Adventure of the Stockbroker's
Clerk'. Good choice.

42:47.235 --> 42:49.714
'Holmes stood by the table

42:49.715 --> 42:52.914
with his hands deep
in his trouser's pockets,

42:52.915 --> 42:55.594
and his chin upon his breast.

42:55.595 --> 42:58.675
"I suppose we ought to call
the police in now," said he.'

43:07.875 --> 43:09.875
Twisted Lip...

43:15.475 --> 43:19.075
"The facts might be met
speciously enough"?

43:39.835 --> 43:42.594
When Korzha said Adelaide
would be "no more",

43:42.595 --> 43:45.274
she was trying to tell us
something about her.

43:45.275 --> 43:49.394
- That we had to prove something?
- No, PRO stands for Public Records Office.

43:49.395 --> 43:51.435
Thank you.

43:52.595 --> 43:54.274
Section VE.

43:54.275 --> 43:56.434
Look at that. And the quote?

43:56.435 --> 43:59.114
It's from 'The Man with the
Twisted Lip', a Holmes story.

43:59.115 --> 44:01.274
All this time
to figure out your own quote?

44:01.275 --> 44:05.034
I bet you remember every line you've
used in every performance. Yeah.

44:05.035 --> 44:07.075
Why that story? What's it about?

44:08.275 --> 44:10.275
A person with a false identity.

44:15.795 --> 44:19.714
Adelaide Stratton is not actually
Adelaide Stratton.

44:19.715 --> 44:22.274
She's Penelope Graves?
