00:15.515 --> 00:17.017
Are you sure you saw these
russians following you?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.269
'Til i lost them
this morning at the depot.

00:19.304 --> 00:21.413
You're certain they
saw you use your abilities?

00:21.448 --> 00:23.523
I mean, there's no
way they could've missed it.

00:23.558 --> 00:25.991
I was underwater
for twenty minutes.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.528
In that case, we really
ought to get out of here.

00:28.563 --> 00:31.031
Come on, tina, i'll
take you somewhere safe, okay?

00:31.531 --> 00:33.498
I don't know.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.536
I mean, i've heard weird
stories about the underground.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.512
Detection works.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.550
But we are still
out of range to neutralize.

00:50.585 --> 00:52.552
Who knows
this better than i?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.057
Tina, look at me.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.059
Now, do i look like the
kind of guy that'd have

00:59.094 --> 01:00.560
anything to
do with something...

01:00.595 --> 01:02.062
something weird, huh?

01:05.565 --> 01:07.032
No.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.569
Now, what do you say we all
take a walk and get in the mv?

01:09.604 --> 01:11.571
Come on.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.594
Bozhemoi,
another one.

01:34.629 --> 01:37.597
It's working.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.110
Jesse, get tina
in the mv, now.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.174
Yuri.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.675
Yuri, come on.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.177
Get up.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.692
Get in.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.160
I lost my power.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.696
Get him in, let's go.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.483
Lie still, brennan.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.997
Scan's complete.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.502
How you doing?

05:02.537 --> 05:04.504
Fine.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.510
Ow!

05:12.011 --> 05:14.013
Okay,
this really sucks.

05:23.523 --> 05:28.528
That gun, it...

05:29.028 --> 05:31.531
fired some sort of
weird laser beam thing at me.

05:31.566 --> 05:33.533
Adam said it was
some kind of particle beam

05:33.568 --> 05:35.535
that blew your dna out of whack.

05:35.570 --> 05:37.554
Is that what he said?

05:37.589 --> 05:39.539
Not in so many words.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.544
I'll just bet.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.553
Did you get
a look at the weapon?

05:54.053 --> 05:55.019
No,
i didn't see much.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.021
I'm pretty sure
they didn't see me.

05:57.056 --> 05:59.308
I guess they blew
up brennan's charge
temporarily, huh?

05:59.343 --> 06:01.561
I'm afraid it's done more than
just neutralize his power.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.567
What do you mean?

06:10.069 --> 06:12.071
I won't know
the damage until i've
gone over the scan.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.543
It's not your fault.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.580
If anyone's
responsible, it's me.

06:20.615 --> 06:21.581
That's crazy.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.083
Well, no more
crazy than your guilt.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.588
Can you tell
me anything about them?

06:28.623 --> 06:31.608
It was a man and a woman.

06:31.643 --> 06:34.594
Tina said they were russians.

06:34.629 --> 06:38.062
Russians?

06:38.097 --> 06:42.602
Pushka h5b7, all files.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.611
Is this the weapon?

06:51.646 --> 06:53.578
Yeah, it could be.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.615
Like i said, i didn't
get a very good look at it.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.082
What is it?

06:58.117 --> 07:02.086
It's top secret russian
military ordinance, circa 1980.

07:02.121 --> 07:07.627
It's a device intended to detect
and neutralize new mutants.

07:07.662 --> 07:13.633
The gun's design schematics,
direct from the kgb.

07:13.668 --> 07:16.601
Look,

07:16.636 --> 07:18.638
according to this,

07:19.138 --> 07:21.140
the weapon can reverse
the neutralization process.

07:21.641 --> 07:22.642
So we've got
to get the weapon.

07:22.677 --> 07:24.108
Yes.

07:24.143 --> 07:25.645
But there's a fail-safe,

07:26.145 --> 07:27.647
in case someone
like us gets a hold of it.

07:28.147 --> 07:31.651
Without the precise
triggering sequence,
the weapon self-destructs.

07:31.686 --> 07:38.157
And without the reversal
process, brennan will die.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.662
I'm going to go
see how brennan's doing.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.132
Answer?

07:48.167 --> 07:49.669
Adam, i'm with the family.

07:50.169 --> 07:51.636
Shalimar, what's going on?

07:51.671 --> 07:53.638
Well, i got to tell
you it's a little weird.

07:53.673 --> 07:56.676
I mean, tina's at the table,
but they're all just sitting

07:56.711 --> 07:58.678
around staring at each other.

08:03.182 --> 08:06.185
Everybody smiles
too much, nobody's talking.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.653
So what's the problem?

08:08.688 --> 08:10.690
What do i know
about family therapy?

08:10.725 --> 08:12.191
You have a family, don't you?

08:12.226 --> 08:14.158
Yeah, but...

08:14.193 --> 08:17.697
well, that's all
the training you need.

08:17.732 --> 08:19.716
Steak tartare?

08:19.751 --> 08:21.666
No, thanks.

08:21.701 --> 08:25.204
I may be feral, but i do
prefer my meat medium-well.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.706
Oh.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.734
Mr. Eckhart.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.742
You've lost a lot of weight.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.210
All that work and stress.

09:06.245 --> 09:12.251
I have something wonderful for
you, the plans for the pushka.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.719
Already been through this.

09:14.754 --> 09:18.507
Your father's weapon
was an embarrassment
to your government,

09:18.542 --> 09:21.903
a humiliation which led to his
untimely death in the gulag.

09:21.938 --> 09:25.264
I promised you twenty thousand
for each new mutant that you

09:25.299 --> 09:27.266
could bring me, neutralized.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.269
The pushka h5b7 works.

09:30.304 --> 09:31.771
Oh.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.738
Well, in that case,

09:33.773 --> 09:38.277
where are these new
mutants that you brought me?

09:38.312 --> 09:42.782
We had a glitch
in our operation.

09:42.817 --> 09:44.248
I'm busy.

09:44.283 --> 09:50.289
Your manners have
deteriorated with your white
cell count, mr. Eckhart.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.291
Even with our glitch,

09:52.792 --> 09:55.795
we managed to neutralize
an electrical new mutant.

09:55.830 --> 09:58.763
And where is he?

09:58.798 --> 10:00.800
He got away but
the pushka got him.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.768
It did.

10:03.803 --> 10:09.308
I swear on my father's grave.

10:09.343 --> 10:11.811
Dosvedanye, mr. Eckhart.

10:12.311 --> 10:15.314
You know how to reach
me if you want to chat
about anything further.

10:22.321 --> 10:29.328
I'm a telekinetic,
and caroline regards my
abilities as pretty wild.

10:29.363 --> 10:33.798
Well, i'll get dessert.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.335
So i guess a
feral new mutant's a whole
new ball game for her, huh?

10:36.370 --> 10:38.302
Caroline was
visiting her mother.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.339
The only time we
had a feral in the house.

10:40.374 --> 10:41.841
The one we placed
with the stewarts.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.809
That ought to be classified.

10:44.844 --> 10:51.350
Adam trusts me,
and i trust my son.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.620
I couldn't do it without him.

10:53.655 --> 10:55.855
So what about you, daniel?

10:55.890 --> 10:57.321
Any new mutancy?

10:57.356 --> 10:58.858
I take after my mother.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.825
As normal as can be.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.828
Chocolate fondue
for five, everybody.

11:03.863 --> 11:06.866
Think of it as catching
your dessert with a fork.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.340
I'm burning up here.

11:16.375 --> 11:21.380
It's your system's reaction
to the neutralization.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.382
I gotta go get that weapon.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.385
The more you move
around, the faster the
neutralization spreads.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.854
Lie still.

11:29.889 --> 11:32.641
We have to stabilize you.

11:32.676 --> 11:35.359
No, no, i'm stable enough.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.896
It's going
to be okay, brennan.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.406
I've got to go.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.909
It's time for
a little serenity.

12:32.451 --> 12:36.455
Adam,
we can save him right?

12:36.490 --> 12:38.958
Honestly, i don't know.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.961
But right now, we have to
buy him all the time we can.

12:41.996 --> 12:43.963
Jesse's going
to find the weapon.

12:45.965 --> 12:46.931
What's that?

12:46.966 --> 12:49.468
Someone calling genomex
from one of our safehouses.

12:49.503 --> 12:52.471
I've already got
a trace on the system.

12:52.506 --> 12:54.974
Safehouse compromise?

12:55.009 --> 12:56.242
Eckhart here.

12:56.277 --> 12:57.476
Can i help you?

12:57.977 --> 12:59.443
Eckhart?

12:59.478 --> 13:02.481
I have some information on the
whereabouts of two new mutants.

13:02.516 --> 13:03.948
Is that so?

13:03.983 --> 13:05.950
One is my father.

13:05.985 --> 13:09.488
The other is a new mutant placed
here yesterday by mutant x.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.007
That weasel.

13:11.042 --> 13:12.491
I'm listening.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.493
I want
a face-to-face.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.461
We'll get back to you.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.499
I held him in my arms
when he was a baby.

13:33.512 --> 13:37.266
Can i assume
you called with good news
in regard to my proposal?

13:37.301 --> 13:41.020
I have an informant who'll lead
you to a family of new mutants.

13:41.055 --> 13:43.022
But i don't
want them dead.

13:46.525 --> 13:50.529
That device inserts
a subdermal governor,
so that you'll be

13:51.030 --> 13:53.032
able to control these new
mutants when you find them.

13:53.067 --> 13:55.034
But this won't be necessary.

13:55.069 --> 13:57.303
We have the pushka.

13:57.338 --> 13:59.538
Oh, yes, of course.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.506
Pushka.

14:02.541 --> 14:07.046
Isn't that russian for
"colossal error in judgment?"

14:07.081 --> 14:11.050
I've solved
the pushka's problems.

14:11.085 --> 14:13.017
That's wonderful.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.554
Take it anyway, just for me.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.556
The bounty?

14:18.057 --> 14:20.024
Twenty thousand
each, as we discussed,

14:20.059 --> 14:22.561
providing that you bring them
to me neutralized and alive.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.528
Then we'll discuss a contract.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.566
Of course, i fully
expect to be disappointed.

14:28.067 --> 14:33.072
Since, as i recall, the pushka
neutralizes new mutants and

14:33.107 --> 14:38.077
then disintegrates their
internal organs cell by cell,

14:38.112 --> 14:41.080
until they're dead.
