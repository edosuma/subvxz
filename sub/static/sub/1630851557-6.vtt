WEBVTT

00:07.799 --> 00:09.676
Okay. You ready for a snack?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.762
This snack is pretty special.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.348
Okay.
Mom just texted to see how it's going,

00:14.431 --> 00:16.265
so let me just answer her
and I'll be right there.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.768
Okay, okay. Hey, hey.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.146
Impress her. Reply back in Spanish.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.525
None of your business, don't be so nosy.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.236
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.654
What does that mean?

00:28.737 --> 00:31.490
It's a colloquial way
that we use in Mexico

00:31.573 --> 00:33.492
to say, "Everything's okay."

00:33.575 --> 00:34.576
Ay. Do it.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.745
None of your business, don't be so nosy.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.724
Did you text her, or--
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

00:57.808 --> 00:59.560
That's private.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.604
That was a brand new letter.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.399
What was it about? And who's Mariano?

01:05.482 --> 01:07.150
You shouldn't be snooping, okay?

01:08.402 --> 01:10.112
Mariano is very important.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.864
I'll tell you about him later.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.158
Did he work at the hotel? Was he a guest?
What does he want you to do?

01:16.493 --> 01:19.496
-Something I don't know if I can ever do.
-What's that?

01:19.580 --> 01:20.914
Attend your nephew's school play?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.626
Sorry, I need to let that go.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.087
I'm afraid I can't explain it yet.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.133
If I told you right now,
you wouldn't understand. Okay?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.511
Especially if I told you in Spanish.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.350
-Shrimp cocktail?
-Yeah.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.104
I have a shrimp cocktail
every time I'm here.

01:44.855 --> 01:45.981
Why is this one special?

01:46.064 --> 01:47.816
Because this one's from 1984.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.403
Just kidding.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.617
You see, shrimp cocktail
always reminds me of my first wife.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.701
What?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.828
You had a wife?

02:00.412 --> 02:01.663
Becca.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.040
She changed my life,

02:03.749 --> 02:05.125
and just in time too.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.252
I was really feeling sad about Julia.

02:09.794 --> 02:13.050
Just picturing her and Chad
on a romantic weekend together

02:13.926 --> 02:15.469
made me sick to my stomach.

02:22.351 --> 02:26.063
I can't believe I told Chad exactly what
he needed to do to make up with Julia.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.689
Now he looks like a hero
and I look ridiculous.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.192
Speaking of…

02:31.026 --> 02:32.528
What's going on with that outfit?

02:32.778 --> 02:35.614
Today's the most important game
of the season.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.616
Hugo Sánchez is wearing number four,

02:37.908 --> 02:39.409
so everything is about
the number four today!

02:40.327 --> 02:41.578
I woke up at four a.m.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.163
I showered in exactly four minutes,

02:43.830 --> 02:46.333
and I paid four dollars for this radio.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.128
It was actually only three-fifty,
but I didn't want to jinx it.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.338
You're gonna get in trouble!

02:51.880 --> 02:52.548
With who?

02:53.048 --> 02:55.008
No one even knows my name at work.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.176
Come on, you're exaggerating.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.096
-Morning, Guillermo.
-Morning, Máximo.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.390
-Morning, Guillermo.
-Good morning…

03:02.224 --> 03:03.225
You.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.810
We have the same name, Memo.

03:07.062 --> 03:10.566
As for Julia,
you should follow the great Hugo Sánchez.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.734
He went where he was wanted.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.195
What does that mean?

03:15.279 --> 03:17.072
They didn't appreciate him in Mexico,

03:17.155 --> 03:20.158
so he went to Spain where
they do appreciate him.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.994
And now he's the king of football.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.704
You should do the same.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.831
You think I should move to Spain?

03:27.499 --> 03:29.626
Julia chose Chad.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.420
You can spend time being sad about it,

03:32.045 --> 03:35.340
or you can join your best pal
for the big game.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.593
Go where you're wanted.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.179
High four!

03:56.028 --> 03:58.614
Inside, outside, wherever you want.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.699
I'll check in on you in a few minutes.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.785
Máximo, I'm so glad you're here.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.122
There are two very, very, very,
very wealthy guests

04:07.206 --> 04:08.624
on the other side of the pool.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.877
They're both big spenders
and huge tippers.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.171
So, this is what I was thinking we can do…

04:14.755 --> 04:16.714
I keep serving both of them,

04:16.798 --> 04:19.259
and you go find a corner and cry lots of

04:19.343 --> 04:20.719
"little boy tears"

04:20.802 --> 04:22.763
wishing you were as awesome as me.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.390
Ready? Go.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.313
Hey. What was that about?

04:38.570 --> 04:40.113
Just my coworker being a pendejo.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.408
I'm trying to earn money
for my mom's surgery,

04:43.492 --> 04:45.327
and he messes with me
every chance he gets.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.204
Surgery. I know that line.

04:47.871 --> 04:48.872
-Line?
-Yeah.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.416
Like, to get bigger tips.
When waitresses pretend to be pregnant.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.545
People do that? Faking pregnancy?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.381
Oh, yeah. My college roommate
used to put a pillow under her shirt.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.091
Her tips doubled. You should try it.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.136
Look. There you are, Becca.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.096
Hi, guys.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.307
-These are my parents, Marcia and Barry.
-We couldn't find you.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.269
I was worried it'd be like that time
that you got mad at us and fled the city.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.604
I did not flee the city.
I went below 23rd Street.

05:12.688 --> 05:15.941
-Hey, we live on the Upper East Side--
-But don't worry, we voted for Mondale.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.443
-Really? With the voting record?
-Have you ever been to New York?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.737
I understood "live" and "don't."

05:22.614 --> 05:23.615
Wow.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.159
That's the first time
we've seen her smile all trip.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.578
-Come on.
-Yep.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.246
You skipped out on
all the morning activities,

05:29.329 --> 05:30.414
you are not missing brunch.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.374
Care to join us, Mister…

05:32.457 --> 05:33.959
-Máximo.
-Máximo.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.127
But I don't know if I can.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.587
-Okay. Where's your boss?
-Barry--

05:36.670 --> 05:38.255
Hey, Don Pablo!

05:38.338 --> 05:40.007
Máximo okay to join us for brunch?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.301
The guest gets what the guest wants.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.927
Gracias. You're in.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.930
At that moment,
I thought of Memo's wise words,

05:47.431 --> 05:49.516
"Go where you're wanted."

05:49.600 --> 05:50.601
Wow, thanks.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.978
I can't sit at the table
dressed like this, though.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.439
Here, allow me.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.859
-Try this. Here we go.
-Oh, yeah.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.113
-Perfecto.
-Yes. Okay.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.240
-Gorgeous.
-You look like Elvis.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.124
I'll be back.
I've got to go call Father Ramón.

06:23.217 --> 06:23.634
Come on.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.594
Ay.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.601
Come on!

06:35.771 --> 06:37.064
Ay!

06:39.149 --> 06:41.193
How's the club sandwich, Mr. Slobotkin?

06:43.779 --> 06:45.614
That guy's bluffing, go all in.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.118
Welcome, familia.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.539
Now, who is ready for some mango ma--

06:54.331 --> 06:55.457
Hello, Héctor.

06:55.541 --> 06:59.169
I know it's very, very, very,
very, very, very early in the day,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.712
but is the kitchen serving…

07:01.922 --> 07:03.549
"little boy tears"

07:03.924 --> 07:06.009
That sounds delicioso.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.594
I'd love a round for the table.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.597
The table?

07:13.350 --> 07:14.351
Of course.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.688
I could get used to this.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.316
Now, today, people treat me well

07:21.400 --> 07:24.736
and tell me what I wanna hear
because I pay them to.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.531
But back then, being treated like--

07:27.614 --> 07:30.826
like I had wealth
and privilege was new to me.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.620
So I keep telling Becca,
"If you're feeling down, why suffer?

07:33.704 --> 07:35.289
Just take a benzo."

07:35.372 --> 07:38.166
Máximo, what is your opinion on benzos?

07:38.792 --> 07:41.920
What kind of car is that?
I don't know much about German brands.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.882
He's funny.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.467
Becca, if you're going to change
for the catamaran, you better hurry.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.677
Come on, sweetheart.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.601
You wanna make some money, right?

07:55.684 --> 07:58.979
And I want them to stop smothering me,
so follow my lead.

07:59.855 --> 08:00.981
Hey, Mom?

08:01.064 --> 08:03.650
Máximo was just telling me
about the Acapulco springs

08:03.734 --> 08:05.152
and how they're very restorative.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.320
Right?

08:06.820 --> 08:07.905
-The--
-Yep.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.991
Oh, yes. They're healing springs
built by the Mayans.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.075
The Mayans?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.828
Wow, that sounds like it would
be helpful for you there, Becca.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.580
-That's what I was thinking.
-Hey, Señor P?

08:16.663 --> 08:20.000
Can Becca borrow Máximo for the day?
Gracias.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.337
And, you know,
you'll need some spending money.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.088
-Would 150 do?
-Thank you.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.216
And I put a little extra in there for you.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.301
And, sweetheart,
why don't you take the rental car?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.303
I got the extra insurance, don't worry.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.554
-Thank you.
-Be careful.

08:32.638 --> 08:33.847
Have fun. Love you.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.308
That was fun. And profitable.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.727
Your parents don't seem so bad.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.855
Why did you wanna ditch them?

08:41.938 --> 08:45.108
They're okay. It's just,
my boyfriend just broke up with me,

08:45.192 --> 08:48.695
and all they want me
to do is verbalize my emotions.

08:48.779 --> 08:49.947
I can relate.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.616
Your mom wants you to talk about
your emotions all the time too?

08:52.699 --> 08:55.410
What? No. My mom is Mexican.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.996
I cried when my parakeet died,
and she handed me a shovel.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.208
Okay. So then, how can you relate?

09:02.543 --> 09:03.544
There's this girl.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.170
I really like her,

09:06.088 --> 09:08.590
but she went away for the weekend
with her boyfriend.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.302
Around here, you don't do that
unless your next trip is to the altar.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.432
Anyway, nice doing business with you.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.771
You know, I am in Acapulco.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.816
And you just got the afternoon free.
And we have money.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.694
And we both have certain people
that we do not want to be thinking about,

09:28.777 --> 09:29.778
so…

09:31.905 --> 09:33.073
do you want to show me around?

09:34.575 --> 09:36.118
That could be fun.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.203
Okay. Give me a couple minutes,
I'll go get changed.

09:38.787 --> 09:39.913
I should change as well.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.249
I don't want someone on the streets
to stop me and order a drink.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.048
Have a good time, Máximo.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.967
But don't forget

09:52.050 --> 09:54.678
you are the staff, they are the guests.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.770
Shit.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.397
This can't be.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.610
Yes, room 310, it's unusable.

10:09.693 --> 10:13.071
Please do not book any guests
in there for a few days. Over.

10:15.032 --> 10:15.824
Broken shower.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.826
Major plumbing problem.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.620
But the TV still works?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.705
Yeah, gets all FOUR channels.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.753
It's a sign!

10:35.219 --> 10:36.595
-Hey, Héctor.
-Hey, Mario.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.514
-It's Memo.
-If you say so.

10:38.597 --> 10:39.723
Okay. Have you seen Máximo?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.476
He's busy with a guest.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.604
Well, when you see him, can you tell him
I'm watching the big match in room 310?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.356
You're watching the big match in room 310?

10:49.691 --> 10:50.567
-No.
-No?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.361
No. No. I'm still working on my English.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.113
I meant the big mattress.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.700
Yeah, the giant mattress in room 310,
I need to inspect it for bugs.

10:58.784 --> 11:01.620
Yes, of course.
I'll be sure to give him the message.

11:01.703 --> 11:02.829
-Thank you.
-Yes.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.123
Saved it.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.655
I never imagined I'd be inside this place.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.948
It's only for rich tourists.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.285
Well, today you are a rich tourist.
If you ask me, you fit right in.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.204
Cuban?

11:44.288 --> 11:45.873
No. I'm Mexican.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.041
A Cuban cigar.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.961
Our clientele enjoy them
with the drinks and view.

11:51.044 --> 11:51.920
No thank you.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.881
Two 12 year old Lagavulin, please.

11:54.214 --> 11:54.756
Neat.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.050
Excellent choice.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.972
-Nice delivery. I'm impressed.
-Thank you.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.850
After four years of Mr. Garcia's
high school Spanish,

12:04.933 --> 12:06.768
I picked up a few necessary phrases.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.608
-Thank you.
-Lady. You're welcome.

12:12.691 --> 12:13.901
Sir. Here you are.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.576
Very smooth.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.798
You know what else?
This place is even older than Las Colinas.

12:36.882 --> 12:37.925
Really?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.635
See that spot?

12:39.718 --> 12:43.597
That's where Liz Taylor got married
to Mike Todd. Cantinflas was his witness.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.768
And that's where Hedy Lamarr posed
for one of her famous portraits.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.479
You really love this stuff, huh?

12:50.562 --> 12:51.939
Sorry, I'm just excited to be here.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.650
No. Don't get me wrong,
this place is amazing.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.985
But I wanna know more about you.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.654
Where do all the locals go?

13:00.197 --> 13:01.615
-Do you really want to know?
-Yes.

13:01.698 --> 13:05.410
I'm a journalism major.
I wanna learn and see everything.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.539
I know just the place.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.348
Güerito. Güerito.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.100
Do you want to buy some handcrafts
for the lady? A purse?

13:28.183 --> 13:29.226
No, thank you.

13:29.810 --> 13:30.602
But here you go.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.568
Why is she calling you güerito?
Doesn't that mean blonde?

13:37.651 --> 13:40.195
Yeah. They call you that
when they think you have money.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.489
Which is why no one has
called me that before.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.077
This is so beautiful.
Is this a daily thing?

13:47.578 --> 13:50.789
Not quite. Today is the day
of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.124
Very holy and sacred.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.043
I'm sure my mom's been
in church all morning.

13:57.129 --> 14:00.048
And they celebrate this
by apprehending little girls?

14:00.132 --> 14:01.175
Oh, no, she's fine.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.886
-She's just being forced into marriage.
-Wait, what?

14:04.428 --> 14:05.929
It's a fake marriage.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.598
It's a street fair tradition.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.225
If someone has a crush on you,
they bring you to the fake judge

14:10.309 --> 14:11.935
-for a fake wedding.
-Okay.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.146
And then you go back to your normal life.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.564
Do you have this in New York City?

14:15.647 --> 14:17.232
Oh, no. Our marriages are very real.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.650
But sometimes just as short.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.364
Becca Rosenthal,
will you pretend-marry me?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.867
I thought you would never pretend-ask.

14:50.891 --> 14:51.558
Máximo!

14:51.683 --> 14:53.101
You're just in time!

14:57.189 --> 15:01.276
Oh, man, I haven't been this excited since
Farrah Fawcett skinny-dipped in our pool!

15:01.610 --> 15:02.861
How did you know I was in here?!

15:03.362 --> 15:04.571
Héctor tipped me off… for five bucks.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.741
Okay, but be quiet!
I don't want to get in trouble.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.627
Mónica? What are you doing here?

15:18.836 --> 15:20.295
I'm here for the game I paid for!

15:27.511 --> 15:28.762
Okay, let's do this.

15:29.263 --> 15:31.014
I'm late for snack time.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.224
So cute.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.519
Do I look like a joke to you?!

15:35.727 --> 15:36.520
Actually, yes.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.607
Marriage is a lifetime commitment.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.776
Máximo, will you love Becca…

15:43.402 --> 15:45.112
in sickness and in health?

15:45.863 --> 15:46.613
Depends.

15:46.697 --> 15:47.614
What kind of disease?

15:47.906 --> 15:48.699
And how contagious is it?

15:49.408 --> 15:50.033
Hey! Knock it off.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.411
Earlier today I turned away a girl

15:52.452 --> 15:55.163
who wanted to marry a boy
just for his Atari.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.498
Come on, just marry us already.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.587
By the authority vested in me by the
municipality of Acapulco,

16:01.962 --> 16:03.505
I pronounce you husband and wife.

16:08.177 --> 16:11.513
The court will now take
a five-minute Frutsi break.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.226
One, two, three!

16:29.907 --> 16:33.869
Let's go, Barcelona!
Kick Atletico's ass!

16:39.124 --> 16:41.084
I had no idea
you were such a soccer fan, Lupe!

16:41.418 --> 16:42.753
Why do you think
I was calling Father Ramón?

16:43.337 --> 16:44.922
To pray for the team?

16:45.255 --> 16:47.007
No, he's my bookie.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.931
GOAL! ATLÉTICO SCORES!

16:57.017 --> 17:00.521
Will you fire me if I rub this in
your face for just one moment?

17:03.148 --> 17:05.776
Then suck it, Lupe! Suck this tangerine.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.236
What's up with Barcelona now?

17:07.402 --> 17:08.779
Not such a hot team, is it?

17:08.904 --> 17:10.280
How does it feel?

17:10.405 --> 17:12.491
In your face, Lupe! In your face!!!

17:12.574 --> 17:14.284
What's going on in here?

17:15.911 --> 17:17.079
Whose idea was this?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.083
Is that true?

17:21.665 --> 17:22.751
Yes, sir.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.592
Move over. You got the best seat.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.638
Memo, come. Sit here.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.980
I thought you'd be mad.

17:43.939 --> 17:46.817
Everyone here will work
twice as hard for me for weeks

17:46.900 --> 17:49.152
because I let them have this moment.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.114
-How many minutes are left?
-About five.

17:54.199 --> 17:57.744
I wasn't done praying.
I had two more saints to go!

17:57.870 --> 18:01.415
Mom, we've been inside the church all day.
It's time to have fun.

18:01.957 --> 18:03.834
I was having fun… with Jesus.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.004
I had to ask him to protect Máximo's soul;

18:08.255 --> 18:10.215
I'm worried the resort is changing him.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.259
You're exaggerating.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.220
How much can it change him
in such a short time?

18:23.687 --> 18:24.188
Hi, mom.

18:24.855 --> 18:25.230
Hi, Sara.

18:26.023 --> 18:26.690
What's going on Mijo?

18:27.149 --> 18:28.942
Why are you dressed like a gringo?

18:29.610 --> 18:30.777
Becca's father loaned these to me.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.780
That's me. I'm Becca.
I'm visiting from New York.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.410
Sin City!

18:38.744 --> 18:41.330
That's Las Vegas. New York is the
city that never sleeps.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.247
Why don't they sleep?

18:42.456 --> 18:44.708
Because they're up all night, sinning.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.294
I don't think I quite understood
everything you said,

18:47.377 --> 18:48.962
but your son is adorable.

18:49.463 --> 18:50.547
Máximo is my husband!

18:50.589 --> 18:52.132
Did I say that right?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.927
Oh, yeah. I definitely said it right.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.553
Mama, don't worry, it's just pretend.

18:56.929 --> 18:58.180
Are you at least Catholic?

18:58.514 --> 19:00.599
Catholic? No, my family are atheists.

19:01.934 --> 19:02.684
They don't believe in God.

19:02.768 --> 19:03.685
I know what it means!

19:04.061 --> 19:06.688
-Look. The Ferris wheel.
-Oh, my God. Wow.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.153
Only two minutes left in sudden death…

19:13.195 --> 19:15.989
Rodriguez kicks it to Hernandez.
Hernandez has an opening and…

19:16.490 --> 19:17.699
GOAL!!

19:17.741 --> 19:19.117
Victory for FC Barcelona!--

19:21.370 --> 19:25.332
Madrid Athletic?
More like Madrid Pathetic!

19:25.916 --> 19:27.417
Suck on these mandarins!

19:27.501 --> 19:28.460
You suck it!

19:28.836 --> 19:31.255
And you suck on these mandarins.

19:31.505 --> 19:33.674
Okay, okay. Everybody, back to work.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.637
Oh, well!

19:41.098 --> 19:42.432
Not for you.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.769
I want you to split your earnings
with Memo.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.062
What earnings?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.359
Of course, Don Pablo.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.564
Acapulco's amazing.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.692
I think I could actually see myself
living here one day.

20:34.193 --> 20:37.487
Yeah. Maybe--
Maybe in that baby right there.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.698
Too bad.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.325
I already called dibs on that one.

20:41.909 --> 20:44.995
But it has a nice guesthouse
if you wanna come visit.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.665
I don't want this day to end.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.251
It doesn't have to.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.470
Would you like to come up to my room?

21:04.056 --> 21:05.057
What about your parents?

21:05.140 --> 21:06.642
I think they should stay
in their own room.

21:07.226 --> 21:08.894
You have a room all to yourself?

21:15.484 --> 21:18.153
Wait, wait.
What were you gonna do in her room?

21:19.905 --> 21:22.241
So, you don't know yet?

21:24.660 --> 21:25.661
Yeah, you know.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.287
You don't know?

21:28.038 --> 21:29.790
Wait, you're messing with me. You know.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.375
You don't know.

21:33.377 --> 21:34.419
We played…

21:35.087 --> 21:36.338
dominoes all night long.

21:41.552 --> 21:44.471
And we also played dominoes again
in the morning.

21:46.682 --> 21:47.724
Twice.

22:00.654 --> 22:03.365
I felt I finally found where I belonged.

22:06.410 --> 22:09.621
Hello. I enjoyed dominoes last night.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.335
To be honest, I've only played dominoes
a couple times before.

22:15.419 --> 22:17.546
I never knew there were
so many variations.

22:17.629 --> 22:21.049
I mean, you turn one domino upside down,
and suddenly, it's a whole different game.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.135
Yeah, told you.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.805
It's so weird that you guys
just played dominoes all night

22:26.889 --> 22:28.515
when you could have been having sex.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.768
Damn it, Hu! I knew you knew!

22:33.896 --> 22:34.897
Anyway…

22:34.980 --> 22:38.066
At that moment,
I felt anything was possible,

22:38.150 --> 22:40.110
including my future with Becca.

22:40.652 --> 22:43.238
I didn't know how wrong I was.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.199
-What is this?
-A pen and paper.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.492
Here in Mexico, we use this to write on.

22:48.327 --> 22:51.705
But maybe you can use them to give me
your phone number and address?

22:53.916 --> 22:54.917
What? What is it?

22:55.501 --> 22:57.753
Nothing. I had a great time yesterday.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.172
Me too.
That's why we should stay in touch.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.049
Maybe I could visit the Big Apple one day.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.302
That's sweet. But honestly,

23:05.385 --> 23:07.930
we were just having fun
and trying to forget, right?

23:09.056 --> 23:10.307
Oh, yeah, sure.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.518
-That is what we talked about.
-Yes. Good.

23:13.894 --> 23:16.730
So, I'm gonna jump in the shower.

23:17.231 --> 23:18.899
And I was thinking,

23:19.399 --> 23:21.485
maybe you can have housekeeping
bring me more towels?

23:22.486 --> 23:23.487
Thank you.

23:35.123 --> 23:38.502
Julia. I thought you weren't supposed
to be back till tomorrow.

23:39.002 --> 23:42.214
-Did you and Chad have a good weekend?
-I don't want to talk about it.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.218
I can't wait.

23:47.553 --> 23:48.554
Okay.

23:50.681 --> 23:51.932
Take care of yourself.

23:52.015 --> 23:54.142
It was very nice being married for a day.

24:00.899 --> 24:01.900
Gracias.

24:02.484 --> 24:03.485
Mr. Rosenthal.

24:04.570 --> 24:05.946
Oh, hey. Thank you.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.365
And thank you
for distracting Becca yesterday.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.576
-It was very kind.
-My pleasure.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.495
Oh, no. Keep 'em. They work for ya.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.497
-Thank you.
-Okay, let's go. Chop, chop.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.082
-Chop, chop. Yeah.
-Tail's up in an hour.

24:26.592 --> 24:29.511
Hey! You forgot your hat!

24:38.729 --> 24:39.897
Like I said:

24:40.564 --> 24:43.734
You're the staff. They are the guests.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.154
It's a line that always divides us.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.573
Even if you don't think it's there.

24:52.910 --> 24:54.244
But maybe one day!

24:55.537 --> 24:58.665
Máximo! Get a mop and get a hose.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.542
Some brat threw up near the pool.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.338
It's in the chaise, in the cushions,

25:04.838 --> 25:06.840
even in the cracks of the cement tiles.

25:07.633 --> 25:10.719
You might need to scrape it out
with a toothbrush if the mop doesn't work.

25:11.595 --> 25:12.804
Also, it smells…

25:13.805 --> 25:14.806
bad,

25:15.307 --> 25:17.684
very, very, very bad.

25:18.519 --> 25:19.520
Hold on.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.188
You made me think it was a real marriage.

25:21.772 --> 25:23.982
And you said that
the story changed your life.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.236
Instead, this was just a downer.

25:28.529 --> 25:32.449
Well, that's what I thought too, at first.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.165
Dude, why the long face?

25:40.249 --> 25:41.375
What do you mean?

25:41.458 --> 25:44.545
A girl walked all over my heart.
I'm crushed.

25:45.087 --> 25:46.296
Are you kidding me?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.299
Máximo,
think about what you did yesterday.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.635
You got handed a bunch of money,

25:51.718 --> 25:54.429
you drove around in a convertible,

25:55.180 --> 25:57.015
you drank scotch at a fancy club,

25:57.516 --> 26:00.143
and you had sex with a girl from New York.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.020
Dude, you won.

26:02.521 --> 26:06.149
You had the biggest, winningest day
either of us have had in our lives.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.944
Meanwhile, you know how my yesterday was?

26:09.570 --> 26:11.613
My football team lost an important game.

26:12.281 --> 26:13.782
Try to find a win in that.

26:13.866 --> 26:15.242
Morning, Memo!

26:15.325 --> 26:17.494
-Hey, Memo!
-What's up, Memo?

26:17.578 --> 26:19.079
Looking good, Memo!

26:21.748 --> 26:23.750
Okay, maybe a teeny-tiny win.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.129
It took a while to sink in,

26:28.297 --> 26:29.840
but my experience with Becca,

26:30.591 --> 26:34.011
what it taught me, changed my life.

26:35.262 --> 26:36.597
So what did it teach you?

26:38.891 --> 26:39.975
That I…

26:42.352 --> 26:43.645
could have more.

26:46.023 --> 26:49.067
Memo and I had a little extra cash
from the day before,

26:49.151 --> 26:52.279
so after work that day,
we got a special meal.

26:52.362 --> 26:53.780
Just the two of us.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.657
Ah, I could get used to this.

26:56.658 --> 26:57.743
My thoughts, exactly.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.623
No more dreaming, Memo.

27:03.373 --> 27:06.168
From now on - we start
turning our dreams into reality.

27:10.964 --> 27:15.844
Oh, I bumped into Ximena, she mentioned
Julia and Chad came back early.

27:16.053 --> 27:16.512
They did?

27:18.931 --> 27:21.016
Yeah, seems like
their trip didn't go as planned.

27:22.559 --> 27:23.685
I wonder what happened?

27:26.855 --> 27:27.439
Yeah…

27:29.358 --> 27:30.234
I wonder.
