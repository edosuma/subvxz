00:02.520 --> 00:05.592
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.518
Good evening, you lucky dogs
and doggettes.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.669
Hey.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.913
Hey, inside this airtight container is
a taste sensation second to none.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.877
Get your taste buds ready.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.429
Ma's homemade pretzels.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.037
You know, they kind of look like
they were made in a home, Cliff.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.316
Yeah, well, they're a little
misshapen, you know?

00:28.480 --> 00:31.074
Ma's arthritis made her
hands stiffen up on her.

00:32.159 --> 00:35.197
That explains the smell of
mentholatum then, huh?

00:35.880 --> 00:37.108
Yeah, here you go, Sam.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.032
Chow down.
They're completely organic.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.479
So, what word would you folks
use to describe these babies?

00:44.800 --> 00:46.950
- Filling.
- Okay. All right, they're filling.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.350
No, no. I just lost one.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.792
Yeah, well, you know, Norm, they're
pretzels. They're supposed to be hard.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.111
Hey, look, I'm gonna go share a
few with the guys in the back.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.238
A little bit of salt and mustard
on there and you really got something.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.595
Yeah, a lawsuit.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.397
I need some water.
I'm having trouble swallowing.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.198
Why are you trying?

01:12.360 --> 01:15.909
Well, I figure it's either that,
or I have to take it out and look at it.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.278
Everybody, I'd like you to meet
my date, Dr. Lilith Sternin,

02:29.440 --> 02:32.989
M.D., Ph.D., Ed.D., APA.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.878
Boy, it sure isn't spelled
like it sounds.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.992
I'm so proud of Frasier.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.879
He's making good on his vow
to start a new life.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.559
Lilith and I met over drinks

02:49.720 --> 02:51.836
after the chemical-dependency
seminar last week.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.231
By the way, I noticed your drinking
went beyond sociability.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.913
Woody, may I have two cognacs?

02:59.080 --> 03:00.957
And what would you like?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.877
Come on, it was just
a meaningless joke.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.076
There's no such thing
as a meaningless joke.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.276
- I'd forgotten.
- I'll have a white wine.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.429
I'll have a beer.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.639
A beer, Woody, and white wine
for the charming lady.

03:14.840 --> 03:15.829
Charming?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.275
Your flattery is
obligatory and specious.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.152
Thank you.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.511
So how do you like Cheers?

03:26.720 --> 03:30.474
Well, it seems adequate
for its purpose.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.552
But I have a feeling that you only
brought me to this place

03:33.720 --> 03:37.474
to surround yourself with people
you know and I don't.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.276
Well, yes.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.549
But what's more, I thought that we
might have a drink or two,

03:43.720 --> 03:45.676
thereby lowering our inhibitions a bit,

03:45.840 --> 03:47.751
and enabling us
to go back to your place,

03:47.920 --> 03:49.911
and have a physical encounter
of some sort.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.672
Well, we won't.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.599
I appreciate your candour.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.394
No, you don't.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.950
You're right. I feel like striking you.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.669
Your attempt at machismo
is totally inadequate.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.274
You can't even make eye contact.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.477
I could look at you if I wanted to.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.037
But frankly, I've grown tired of
counting the comb marks in your hair.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.471
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:16.720 --> 04:19.029
I'm going to go and use
the little boys' room.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.437
Why does a grown man
feel the need to euphemize?

04:22.640 --> 04:25.996
Well, he did drink that beer
awfully fast.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.950
That's the hospital. I'm on call.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.634
With any luck, it will be one
of my manic-depressives

04:35.800 --> 04:37.836
and the evening will take an upturn.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.908
Well, you gotta love her, don't you?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.719
Excuse me, miss?

04:42.880 --> 04:46.350
Would you please inform Dr Crane
that I had to leave on an emergency?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.272
And kindly relay this message:

04:48.640 --> 04:50.756
"I've had a very
uncomfortable evening,

04:50.920 --> 04:53.150
and I don't think we should see
each other in the future,

04:53.320 --> 04:54.469
except professionally."

04:55.280 --> 04:57.316
What? No good-night kiss?

04:58.360 --> 05:00.635
I kiss only as a prelude to passion.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.752
Well, we've been warned.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.392
Oh, dear.

05:09.560 --> 05:13.235
It appears Frasier
has been rejected again.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.589
That poor yutz.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.991
Even the trash only gets dumped
once a week.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.873
- Where's Lilith?
- Dr Sternin was called away

05:24.040 --> 05:25.155
on an emergency.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.993
Well, that's all right.
Anyway, I didn't much care for Lilith.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.628
Sam, do you mind if I just use
your office for a moment?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.870
Sure, sure. How come?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.957
I'm going to weep.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.715
Poor Frasier.
I wish he could find someone

05:38.880 --> 05:40.632
to help him ease his loneliness.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.958
Sam, couldn't you give him
one of your hand-me-downs?

05:44.120 --> 05:45.678
I already did.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.989
No, I was thinking of someone
who would be, like, fun.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.354
Well, now that you mention it,
I guess I could prescribe

05:54.520 --> 05:57.432
a little Candi Pearson
for Dr Crane.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.238
Candi. I like Candi.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.433
I sincerely doubt that Frasier
would approve being set up

06:03.600 --> 06:07.798
for a one-night stand
with one of your jiggling jugheads.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.194
I am not talking
about sex necessarily.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.876
I just think that Frasier should know
that women don't always mean misery.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.160
I think Candi is just
what the doctor prescribed.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.073
She's cute, she's fun and she's
never met a man she didn't like.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.832
A lot.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.235
- Hi, Sam.
- Hey, Candi.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.913
Boy, is it good to see you.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.071
You are beautiful as ever.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.508
Sam, I'm getting a little low.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.830
I'm also running out of beer.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.558
Well, yeah.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.790
Maybe I can help you out on both
counts here, Frasier.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.313
I'd like you to meet Candi.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.914
- Hi.
- Hi, yourself.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.314
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a cute forehead?

06:53.840 --> 06:58.038
Frankly, no, but I've been told
I have acute anxiety.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.353
What's your name?

07:01.520 --> 07:03.397
Dr Frasier Crane.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.754
I'm Candi.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.638
Yes, so I see from your necklace.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.869
Candi, with an l.

07:08.040 --> 07:12.477
Well, I used to spell it with a Y,
but nobody ever took me seriously.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.792
So then I switched it to an l.
You know, like Gandhi?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.273
Yes, yes. I understand
that's why he did it.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.471
Could I buy you a drink?

07:25.640 --> 07:27.437
Oh, sure.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.756
- Something with bubbles.
- Very well.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.391
Sam,

07:32.640 --> 07:35.518
champagne cocktails Ã  deux.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.520
It looks like you and Candi
are becoming friends.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.750
Well, she seems like
a very pleasant sort.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.070
Sam, she's not here
for you, is she?

07:43.240 --> 07:45.993
No, no, no. It looks to me
like she's here for you, Frasier.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.275
Well, yes, it does.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.555
Well, you're lucky, doc.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.915
You know, Sammy has never
bothered to set me up

07:51.080 --> 07:52.798
with one of his bevy of babes.

07:52.960 --> 07:53.995
Not that I need help.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.515
No, just mercy.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.750
Oh, I see. This is all a set-up.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.275
Well, I've seen that movie before.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.035
When all else fails, hire some
strumpet to date the town wretch.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.078
Hey, this is not a set-up,
and she's not a strumpet.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.674
She's just here because I thought
you might like each other.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.389
No expectations, no frills.
You know, just kind of a casual thing.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.069
Well, thanks, Sam, but no thanks.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.593
Yeah, but...

08:25.280 --> 08:30.308
I see your little attempt to corrupt
Frasier has failed miserably.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.231
I'm sorry, miss, but I just
figured out what this is all about.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.638
I'm not in the habit of fraternizing
with women of your type.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.309
What type is that?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.875
You know. Fun.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.069
Good night.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.919
I don't believe it.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.275
Frasier just turned down Candi.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.796
If it was me, I'd be making her
scrambled eggs by now.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.838
I'm sure she'd prefer that to sex.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.550
Why do you open your mouth?

09:03.760 --> 09:05.079
I didn't know she was there, Norm.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.915
You know, we need to put
a little bell on her.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.515
I don't know what you think
this is all about,

09:14.680 --> 09:17.558
but I just came here
because Sam said you were a nice guy

09:17.760 --> 09:19.034
and you were down in the dumps.

09:19.200 --> 09:24.035
And I thought maybe we could talk
a little bit and have a couple of laughs.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.276
Well, fine. We've had that.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.351
You've done your charity work
for the evening.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.953
Charity work?

09:30.120 --> 09:32.429
You really are a sad case.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.798
How a guy with such a great forehead
could get so messed up.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.398
Wait.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.597
The least I can do is give you a ride
home. I'm going in your direction.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.832
- Which direction?
- Out.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.598
Thank you, Frasier.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.352
You're sweet.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.990
Say, you know, I just realized I'm
feeling kind of hungry.

09:53.160 --> 09:57.392
- Would you like to get some food?
- Oh, food. My favourite.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.832
Good Lord.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.956
Frasier left with her?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.588
Well, they have nothing in common.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.832
What could he possibly have
to say to that woman?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.037
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."

10:17.080 --> 10:18.069
Pretzels.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.468
Fresh pretzels.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.029
Get your fresh pretzels here.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.237
Delivered to you piping hot
from Ma Clavin's kitchen.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.674
Come on, Norm. You're his friend.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.308
You promised you'd tell him to stop
bringing that stuff in here.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.234
All right. I'll take care of it
while I still have some teeth left.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.397
Hey, incidentally, Normie,
I don't mind telling you,

10:37.560 --> 10:41.189
you know, how much Ma appreciates
the fact that you guys like her pretzels.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.998
- Great, Cliff, listen--
- She's been down in the dumps

10:43.160 --> 10:44.149
these past 40 years.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.995
You know, when she heard how you
felt about these babies, well,

10:48.160 --> 10:50.628
she just broke right down and cried.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.517
Oh, boy, pretzels.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.833
Anyone seen Frasier yet?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.355
No, not since he left
last night with Candi.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.034
Yeah, I wonder what they did,
you know?

11:05.360 --> 11:08.591
I'm sure they just
went out and had dinner.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.597
Yeah, I bet they
had some dinner, all right.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.591
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.594
A real good dinner in
a real fine restaurant, huh?

11:17.320 --> 11:19.072
Actually, the best.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.798
I wonder if the restaurant
was crowded.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.512
I sincerely doubt that Frasier
took advantage of that young girl.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.598
Come on, Diane. Frasier's a guy,
no different from the rest of us.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.239
- Yeah.
- There's one difference.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.517
He's scored since the invention
of the wheel.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.435
It doesn't have to be a big bell
as long as we can hear it.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.189
Trust me.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.555
He might have taken pity
on that poor girl

11:50.720 --> 11:53.109
and done something
to be nice to her.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.750
Frasier is far too
sophisticated a man

11:56.920 --> 12:01.118
to be swept away
by her transparent charms.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.633
Greetings, one and all.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.236
Say hello to Mrs Frasier Crane.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.795
You're married?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.598
Well, no.
No, we're not married.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.034
And we won't be for a long time.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.633
An hour.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.914
Yeah, we're gonna tie the knot
right here today

12:28.080 --> 12:30.116
where we met just 16 hours ago.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.157
- That is, if it's okay with you, Sam.
- Yeah.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.436
Sixteen hours
isn't much time, Frasier.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.034
Well, that depends on how
you spend those 16 hours.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.079
Hey, Woody,
some champagne here.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.912
I mean, this is quite an occasion.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.559
I know I'm responsible for that,

12:44.720 --> 12:46.039
but I didn't even see that coming.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.077
The thought never even
crossed my mind.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.748
Thoughts can't cross
your mind, Sam.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.758
The bridge is out.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.796
Okay, well, I would like to
propose a toast, then.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.150
This is one that my father said
at my wedding,

13:00.360 --> 13:01.839
and it's kind of always
stuck with me.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.594
"Thank God I'm not paying for this."

13:05.400 --> 13:07.914
Thank you. Thank you, all.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.276
Spot.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.429
Look at me.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.194
I'm rumpled and loving it.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.075
Sam, I'll never be able
to thank you enough

13:22.240 --> 13:23.958
for introducing me
to this precious flower.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.111
That goes double for me.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.436
Candi is the perfect girl for me.

13:28.640 --> 13:33.430
I got so tired of thinking
and dating at the same time.

13:34.040 --> 13:38.272
But with Candi, I'm no longer
"Frasier Crane, pompous intellectual."

13:38.440 --> 13:41.637
I'm "Fras, pompous madcap."

13:41.960 --> 13:44.110
And I kind of like him.
Come on, darling.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.714
We'll just stop off at my place
for a quick celebration,

13:46.880 --> 13:49.758
and then we've got a ring to buy before
the justice of the peace arrives.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.353
Oh, Fras?

13:54.080 --> 13:55.957
Just a moment, dear.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.554
What is it, Diane?

13:57.720 --> 14:01.918
I hate what I'm about to say,
and I pray to God it's not true,

14:02.200 --> 14:06.990
but I think you're doing this to draw
me out, to force me to make a stand.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.469
Please, tell me if I'm wrong,
and I'll be forever silent.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.108
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.834
Yes, you are, Diane.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.999
Okay.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.593
Fine.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.911
He's lost his mind.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.870
Well, Cliffie, we got time for a wedding
on this evening's agenda?

14:28.040 --> 14:31.316
Yeah, yeah, well, if we put back
the billiards game.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.392
And we gotta miss the first ten minutes
of nighttime Wheel of Fortune.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.109
I hate it when someone throws a
monkey wrench in the works.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.269
No, don't worry, Norm.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.000
Look, we'll just postpone the
darts game until after the vows.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.355
Yeah? Aren't you forgetting
something, Mr Organizer?

14:45.360 --> 14:47.396
Today's the day when People
magazine comes out.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.232
- Yeah, so?
- So when are we supposed

14:49.400 --> 14:52.039
to black out celebrities' teeth?
Tell me that.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.074
You know, you're not so dumb.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.515
Thank you, Carla.

15:04.560 --> 15:09.588
Frasier's not my cup of tea, but as
husbands go, he could be all right.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.193
He won't hurt you,

15:11.360 --> 15:13.954
and I think he'll always be faithful.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.429
And if he isn't, who cares?

15:18.160 --> 15:19.912
That's kind of beautiful.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.433
Yeah.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.998
Dr Crane?

15:24.240 --> 15:26.515
I couldn't be happier for you.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.473
- She is a beautiful girl.
- Thank you, Woody.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.830
My dream is to someday fall in
love with a beautiful girl,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.718
and for her to fall in love with me.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.793
We get married and have three
wonderful children who grow up,

15:39.960 --> 15:43.509
and move away from us,
and hardly ever write.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.352
She and I would grow old
in an empty house together and die.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.038
I forgot. I also want a boat.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.635
It'll happen for you, Woody.
I know it.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.791
Shall we begin?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.956
May we all gather down at this end?

16:03.120 --> 16:04.838
My dear?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.513
You look lovely.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.033
You too, Frasier.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.668
But you know what we're missing?

16:10.840 --> 16:11.829
Music.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.228
Music. Of course.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.197
Say, anybody play the piano?

16:15.560 --> 16:16.675
I play a little.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.310
Well, get up there, young man,
and regale us with your virtuosity.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.474
Woody? Woody?

16:33.640 --> 16:36.108
I don't think that's quite right
for a wedding.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.438
- It's perfect, senseless. Madcap.
- Yeah.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.637
Frasier would've hated it.
Fras thinks it's swell.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.952
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

16:55.120 --> 16:57.190
to join this man and this woman
in matrimony.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.071
Marriage is a sacred union
not to be entered into lightly.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.114
If there is any person present
who knows a reason

17:04.280 --> 17:08.397
why this couple should not be united,
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.152
I do.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.709
Right phrase, wrong wedding.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.830
I have to stop this and stop it now.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.148
There's something I must say.

17:17.319 --> 17:18.594
I've tried to avoid it.

17:18.760 --> 17:22.275
I've tried to hold my peace,
but I can't.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.598
It's urgent. Please.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.829
Sam, help. Let's go, fast.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.717
Listen up, everybody.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.558
We'll be back in a minute here.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.870
In the meantime, you'll be entertained

17:35.040 --> 17:37.190
by the magic fingers
of Mr Woody Boyd.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.159
Frasier, Candi, I apologize
for interrupting

17:48.320 --> 17:51.437
what should be the most
important moment in a person's life.

17:51.600 --> 17:56.310
But I'm compelled to do this by my
affection and respect for both of you.

17:57.120 --> 18:01.875
Isn't it possible, that in the heat
of recent events,

18:02.040 --> 18:05.919
you might be confusing
physical attraction for deeper,

18:06.080 --> 18:07.752
more sublime emotions?

18:07.960 --> 18:09.916
You know, in the
psychiatric profession,

18:10.080 --> 18:12.958
we have a statement for
that little theory of yours:

18:14.440 --> 18:16.396
Frasier.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.273
You have to admit you and Candi
are as different as night and day.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.874
You are as different as Sam and l.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.349
Frasier, hear me out.

18:25.680 --> 18:30.800
We were, as you are,
diametrically opposed personalities.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.238
At first, our differences
were charming to us.

18:35.400 --> 18:40.758
I found Sam's lack of refinement and
sophistication crudely provocative.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.349
Yeah, and I liked the way
her hair smelled.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.999
I'm sure, in addition,
you were excited

18:49.160 --> 18:51.720
by the intellectual vistas
to which I exposed you?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.678
No, I really think
it was that conditioner.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.629
The point I'm trying to make
is that the only thing we had

19:00.800 --> 19:03.633
- was a great physical relationship.
- Yeah, and we had a lot of that.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.552
But when we'd go to concerts,
Sam would be bored stiff,

19:09.720 --> 19:12.029
and I'd be excited, and we'd be
on totally different planes.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.430
Yeah, but we caught the same flight
once we got home

19:14.600 --> 19:16.636
and hit the old Posturepedic.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.678
Don't you see what
you're doing here?

19:18.840 --> 19:20.956
You feel guilty, at least
subconsciously,

19:21.120 --> 19:23.111
for rejecting me,
and that's causing you to act out.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.068
For once in your life, Frasier, put away
your flashcard psychoanalysis

19:27.240 --> 19:28.309
and face the truth.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.511
How dare you insult
my professional acumen!

19:30.680 --> 19:31.829
Here's what I think--

19:32.000 --> 19:34.150
Candi, please, you were not put
on this earth to think.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.834
Diane, you are without a doubt--
Oh, my God.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.718
What have I done?
What have I said?

19:38.880 --> 19:40.472
You said, "l wasn't put
on this earth--"

19:40.640 --> 19:41.709
No, I know what I said.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.230
I just can't believe I said it.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.753
Candi?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.876
I didn't mean it. Please forgive me.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.395
Yes, you did mean it, Frasier.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.959
And what's more, you're right.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.154
You know, I didn't understand
anything anybody was saying

19:56.320 --> 19:57.719
except for Sam.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.598
We can't get married,
because I don't deserve you.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.558
No, no, I don't deserve you.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.757
I don't deserve to put polish
on your toenails.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.753
Although it was the highlight
of breakfast.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.949
Maybe we should spend
more time together

20:19.120 --> 20:20.439
before we take this step.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.390
You mean, like, the weekend?

20:25.600 --> 20:28.239
That long? Well, maybe.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.675
I think you've made
a very wise decision.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.558
I think we'll be going now.

20:32.720 --> 20:36.269
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry I snapped
at you that way.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.237
It's the first time I've raised my voice
to you in anger,

20:38.400 --> 20:39.674
and I promise it'll be the last.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.239
That's too bad.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.757
I thought you were kind of sexy
when you were mad.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.955
Really?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.190
Well, don't just sit there.
Get a move on!

20:50.400 --> 20:52.914
Sam, your office is a pigsty.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.514
- See to it.
- Oh, Frasier.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.955
And you know, if we can put
a man on the moon,

20:58.120 --> 21:00.236
why can't we put metal
in a microwave?

21:01.440 --> 21:04.398
Diane, I gotta compliment you
on the way you handled Frasier.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.675
That was pretty good.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.159
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.915
Yeah, I hate to see a
man and woman make a mistake.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.117
- Frasier and Candi.
- Frasier and Candi. Yeah.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.911
Well, no, no, I mean, you gotta hang
out with somebody for a long time.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.833
You gotta really get to know them
before you take a big step like that.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.639
Yes. If something's worthwhile,
it's worth waiting for.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.831
Absolutely.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.713
Well.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.593
A lot of people out there
waiting for a wedding,

21:32.800 --> 21:34.518
and no bride, no groom.

21:34.680 --> 21:35.954
Guess it's up to us, huh?

21:39.800 --> 21:41.552
My God, Sam.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.553
I can't believe my ears.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.997
You're serious, aren't you?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.555
Oh, no, no.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.551
I just meant that we should
go out there

21:56.720 --> 21:58.039
and serve those people
some drinks.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.189
That's all.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.716
- That's what I meant too.
- No, it isn't.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.591
What did you think
I was talking about?

22:07.120 --> 22:08.633
- Come on.
- Well, for a moment there,

22:08.800 --> 22:12.429
I confess, I thought you were talking
about something else.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.835
And what would your answer
have been?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.513
No, Sam.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.070
That's the sort of question that has to
be asked before it can be answered.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.753
Well, if I heard the answer,

22:23.920 --> 22:26.229
maybe it would be easier
for me to ask the question.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.552
Very well.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.909
The answer is no.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.349
Well, the question was,

22:36.520 --> 22:39.080
"Have you ever met a man who gave
you the hots more than me?"

22:43.800 --> 22:45.756
I'd like to change my answer.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.070
- Fine. Go on.
- Then the answer is yes.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.913
Well, then the question was,
"Do you wanna go to bed with me?"

22:51.080 --> 22:52.433
I wanna change my answer again.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.750
Well, that's okay.
And I'll change my question to,

22:54.920 --> 22:59.516
"ls there any way that you would not
object to not going to bed with me?"

22:59.680 --> 23:00.874
Wait a minute.
