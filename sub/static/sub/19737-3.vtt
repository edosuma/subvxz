00:01.914 --> 00:03.703
Over 68 million Americans

00:03.727 --> 00:06.437
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:06.469 --> 00:07.936
If danger strikes,

00:08.219 --> 00:10.420
the FBI's International Response Team

00:10.454 --> 00:12.722
is called into action.

00:47.491 --> 00:48.558
Come on. Let's get out of here.

00:48.592 --> 00:51.695
What makes you think
I'm that kind of girl?

00:51.729 --> 00:52.896
After three years together,

00:52.930 --> 00:54.130
now you're gonna play hard to get?

00:54.165 --> 00:55.699
Got to keep you on your toes, baby.

00:55.733 --> 00:57.267
Don't you mean wrapped
around your finger?

00:57.301 --> 00:59.969
Well, at least something will be on it!

01:01.238 --> 01:02.639
You're killing me.

01:04.809 --> 01:08.111
Oye. Riquísima, mamacita.

01:08.145 --> 01:10.313
¿Lo que estás haciendo con ese gringo?

01:10.348 --> 01:12.048
- iDéjame en paz!
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:12.083 --> 01:13.616
W-What's going on?
W-What'd you say to her?

01:13.651 --> 01:14.918
Drew, stop.

01:16.287 --> 01:17.660
- Okay, let's go, Drew.
- Wait.

01:17.685 --> 01:19.222
- Now, vámonos!
- You got a problem, man?

01:27.298 --> 01:29.833
What was that, Paola? I
could have handled that joker.

01:29.867 --> 01:31.724
This is not like New York, Drew.

01:31.749 --> 01:34.003
In Bogotá, life is cheap
and people die for no reason,

01:34.038 --> 01:35.138
so you got to be careful.

01:35.172 --> 01:36.473
¿Puedes ahorrar algo de cambio?

01:36.507 --> 01:38.441
- iPor favor! iPor favor!
- Okay. I get it.

01:38.476 --> 01:41.745
No hemos comido en días.

01:41.779 --> 01:45.615
No, seriously. I'm sorry.

01:45.649 --> 01:48.918
I shouldn't run my mouth
in someplace I don't know.

01:51.856 --> 01:55.959
Okay, then call it a night
and stay in your room.

01:55.993 --> 01:57.494
I've barely been out of New York,

01:57.528 --> 01:58.661
let alone South America.

01:58.696 --> 01:59.829
I want to go have some fun!

01:59.864 --> 02:02.932
You'll have plenty of that
when you meet my folks mañana.

02:04.001 --> 02:07.670
Now go to bed.

02:07.705 --> 02:10.173
¿Señora, taxi?

03:08.265 --> 03:09.666
Tied again.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.501
Well, I did have a good teacher.

03:12.336 --> 03:14.237
So, how about returning the favor

03:14.271 --> 03:15.738
and coming out on a case with us?

03:15.773 --> 03:18.041
You know my weapon of
choice is a computer.

03:18.075 --> 03:19.676
You sure that has nothing to do

03:19.710 --> 03:21.511
with the fact that you hate to fly?

03:21.545 --> 03:23.079
Mae told you, di...

03:23.113 --> 03:25.381
That's the last time I
take her to happy hour.

03:25.416 --> 03:26.783
She can put 'em away.

03:27.751 --> 03:28.952
And hustle you in pool.

03:28.986 --> 03:30.086
That's my girl.

03:30.120 --> 03:30.954
What is it?

03:32.189 --> 03:36.459
IRT just received a request
from the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá.

03:36.494 --> 03:38.828
Let's go.

03:40.130 --> 03:42.565
One Drew Dafaoe, 28, of NYC

03:42.600 --> 03:44.868
was found dead in the
alleyway behind his hotel

03:44.902 --> 03:46.035
in Bogotá, Colombia.

03:46.070 --> 03:47.370
There was no sign of a struggle,

03:47.404 --> 03:49.305
so local police ruled it a suicide.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.274
But someone doesn't think it is.

03:51.308 --> 03:54.210
Correct-o, Drew's girlfriend
is a native of Bogotá

03:54.245 --> 03:56.027
and says he has no reason
to take his own life,

03:56.052 --> 03:58.114
so she filed a formal
complaint with the U.S. Embassy

03:58.148 --> 03:59.682
suspecting there was foul play involved.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.033
There's nothing in his medical record

04:01.058 --> 04:03.486
to suggest that Drew was of
poor mental or physical health.

04:03.521 --> 04:05.922
Drew claimed on, his
visitor's declaration form

04:05.956 --> 04:08.424
that he was in possession
of an engagement ring.

04:08.459 --> 04:09.826
He was gonna propose.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.227
That doesn't sound like somebody

04:11.262 --> 04:12.596
who's about to take his own life.

04:12.621 --> 04:13.877
Unfortunately, from these photos,

04:13.902 --> 04:15.231
I can't really tell what happened.

04:15.266 --> 04:16.798
I mean, he could have
jumped or been pushed.

04:16.834 --> 04:18.801
True, but what is clear is,

04:18.836 --> 04:20.136
in the hours leading up to Drew's death,

04:20.170 --> 04:21.571
his behavior was very suspect.

04:21.605 --> 04:23.806
After exhausting his
ATM withdrawal limit,

04:23.841 --> 04:26.643
he then went to a local bank
and cleared out his account.

04:26.677 --> 04:28.278
So where's that money?

04:28.312 --> 04:29.979
Missing, As is the ring.

04:30.014 --> 04:32.315
Here I thought Colombia
was cleaning up their act.

04:32.349 --> 04:33.516
Well, it is.

04:33.551 --> 04:36.119
And because of it, more
Americans have visited Colombia

04:36.153 --> 04:38.454
in the last two years than
they have in the previous 20.

04:38.489 --> 04:40.423
Mm, but like anything, it takes time,

04:40.457 --> 04:43.092
so crime, is still a
big problem for them.

04:43.127 --> 04:45.328
And tourists are always
the easiest targets.

04:45.362 --> 04:47.330
Well, especially when the perception is

04:47.364 --> 04:48.848
that all Americans are rich.

04:48.873 --> 04:51.467
Which explains why 219 Americans

04:51.502 --> 04:53.970
have been targeted in Colombia in 2015.

04:54.004 --> 04:56.205
And most of those were
express kidnappings.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.341
Yeah, but after the victims
are taken at gunpoint,

04:58.375 --> 05:00.176
go to the ATM, withdraw the money,

05:00.210 --> 05:01.978
they're usually immediately released.

05:02.012 --> 05:03.980
And these types of criminals
are highly organized,

05:04.014 --> 05:06.849
mobile, experienced,
but not usually violent.

05:06.884 --> 05:08.551
So, if this is an escalation,

05:08.586 --> 05:10.486
there's no telling what dangers

05:10.521 --> 05:12.889
more Americans might find themselves in.

05:39.044 --> 05:41.470
"Poverty does not destroy virtue
nor does wealth bestow it."

05:41.486 --> 05:43.556
The Colombian proverb says,

05:43.581 --> 05:48.459
"Poverty does not destroy
virtue nor wealth bestow it."

05:59.803 --> 06:01.337
Only cinco pesos.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.162
No. No.

06:02.931 --> 06:04.298
No, thank you.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.887
- Good for you.
- No.

06:05.912 --> 06:06.912
Yeah, here you go.

06:07.104 --> 06:08.168
Muchas gracias.

06:08.319 --> 06:09.352
Get!

06:09.377 --> 06:11.111
iFuera de aquí, ratas!

06:11.136 --> 06:12.903
iAntes de que llame a la policía!

06:12.928 --> 06:15.029
iTodos vamos! iVamos!

06:19.826 --> 06:22.126
"Gamines," or "throwaway children"...

06:22.290 --> 06:25.692
It's a remnant of
Colombia's recent civil wars.

06:25.726 --> 06:28.428
The unemployment,
poverty, lack of housing

06:28.462 --> 06:29.796
has left their parents struggling

06:29.830 --> 06:30.830
and the children abandoned.

06:30.865 --> 06:33.266
So they live on the streets,
join gangs to survive.

06:33.301 --> 06:35.335
What's the Colombian
government doing about this?

06:35.369 --> 06:36.336
Not enough.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.772
I'm sorry about this vermin.

06:38.806 --> 06:41.141
They're a stain on our country.

06:41.175 --> 06:43.610
Agent Garrett. I'm Detective Benavides.

06:43.644 --> 06:45.379
Detective, thanks for having us.

06:45.404 --> 06:48.281
Agent Seger, Jarvis, and Simmons.

06:48.316 --> 06:50.352
I'm sorry that you had to
fly all the way down here

06:50.609 --> 06:53.186
for this... how do you
say... Open-and-close case.

06:53.221 --> 06:55.188
Oh, it certainly looks that way, but...

06:55.223 --> 06:56.656
It is.

06:56.691 --> 06:59.192
This is no longer the
land of Pablo Escobar.

06:59.227 --> 07:01.828
Colombia has taken its
place in a new world

07:01.862 --> 07:04.631
and we would hope that
its neighbors in the North

07:04.665 --> 07:07.133
would trust that we can
police our own backyard.

07:07.168 --> 07:09.402
Well, no disrespect intended,

07:09.437 --> 07:12.205
but when a formal complaint
is filed with our embassy,

07:12.240 --> 07:14.040
we take that very seriously.

07:14.075 --> 07:17.010
Fine. How can I be of assistance?

07:17.044 --> 07:21.314
We'd like to see the
deceased's hotel room.

07:25.086 --> 07:26.686
Unfortunately, that's not possible.

07:26.721 --> 07:28.221
Because we didn't declare this a crime,

07:28.256 --> 07:31.591
we've removed the deceased's belongings

07:31.626 --> 07:33.059
and released the room back to the hotel.

07:33.094 --> 07:35.195
Which we then rented to a new guest.

07:35.229 --> 07:36.463
We're very busy,

07:36.497 --> 07:40.333
and the Chico Reservado district
is very popular with tourists,

07:40.368 --> 07:42.535
but I can show it to you if you'd like.

07:42.570 --> 07:44.237
If the room's been cleaned and occupied,

07:44.272 --> 07:46.072
then all the evidence
has been compromised.

07:46.107 --> 07:48.174
Agreed, so, Detective,

07:48.209 --> 07:51.845
can you instead, escort
Agents Jarvis and Simmons

07:51.879 --> 07:53.546
to the alleyway where the body was found

07:53.581 --> 07:54.848
so they can take a look?

07:54.882 --> 07:56.716
Of course.

07:56.751 --> 07:58.084
Mae, can you check out the alley

07:58.119 --> 08:00.120
while Simmons takes a look at the roof?

08:00.154 --> 08:01.020
You got it, boss.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.956
This way, por favor.

08:02.990 --> 08:06.926
Let's go have a chat, with
Drew's girlfriend, Paola.

08:06.961 --> 08:09.462
I know this is a difficult time for you,

08:09.497 --> 08:13.066
so I apologize in advance
for what I'm about to ask,

08:13.100 --> 08:16.703
but every piece of information is vital.

08:16.737 --> 08:18.305
Of course.

08:18.339 --> 08:22.409
Did Drew have any involvement
with drugs or drug dealers?

08:22.443 --> 08:23.576
Nada.

08:23.611 --> 08:24.911
Are you sure?

08:24.945 --> 08:26.880
Drew's father's life
was destroyed by drugs,

08:26.914 --> 08:28.148
so he never touched them.

08:28.182 --> 08:30.650
Where were you the
night of Drew's death?

08:30.685 --> 08:33.919
At my parents' home in the
Teusaquillo district of Bogotá.

08:33.953 --> 08:36.289
But didn't you travel
to Colombia together?

08:36.323 --> 08:38.457
Mis padres are very old-fashioned.

08:38.491 --> 08:40.927
They would not approve of me
staying in Drew's hotel room.

08:40.961 --> 08:43.596
They didn't know you were
living together in New York?

08:43.631 --> 08:45.732
No.

08:45.766 --> 08:46.933
No.

08:46.967 --> 08:50.303
If your father found out,
would Drew have been in danger?

08:50.338 --> 08:52.972
Mi padre loves me, and in the end,

08:53.007 --> 08:55.008
he has always accepted my decisions.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.944
And in return, I'm very
respectful of him and mi madre,

08:57.978 --> 08:59.179
but never afraid.

08:59.213 --> 09:00.847
Of course.

09:00.881 --> 09:03.080
But I still believe this was my fault.

09:03.105 --> 09:05.452
Paola, why do you say that?

09:06.654 --> 09:09.289
Well, Drew and I were dancing

09:09.323 --> 09:11.991
at El Sitio nightclub
down the street, and...

09:12.026 --> 09:14.828
when we left, we had a
run-in with an halcón.

09:14.862 --> 09:17.464
And he tried to talk to
me, but I pulled away.

09:17.498 --> 09:21.000
But then Drew stepped in, and
he had some words with him.

09:21.035 --> 09:22.435
¿Halcón? A hawk?

09:22.470 --> 09:25.538
Yes, halcones are the
lowest-ranking members

09:25.573 --> 09:26.873
of the cartel.

09:26.907 --> 09:28.074
They're responsible

09:28.109 --> 09:31.945
for reporting the activities
of the police, rival groups,

09:31.979 --> 09:34.948
back to their captains.

09:34.982 --> 09:36.950
Are you sure he was an halcón?

09:36.984 --> 09:38.017
He had a walkie-talkie.

09:38.052 --> 09:40.186
Which is how they communicate.

09:40.221 --> 09:41.187
The radio network

09:41.222 --> 09:44.457
is a shadow communication
system for the cartels.

09:44.492 --> 09:47.360
And carved into the handle
were the initials "LP."

09:47.395 --> 09:50.830
LP... The Los Primos cartel.

09:50.865 --> 09:52.866
That's one of Bogotá's most feared.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.801
And he also had a gun, so I think

09:54.835 --> 09:57.383
they may have followed Drew
to his hotel and killed him.

09:58.227 --> 10:02.375
I-I shouldn't have left him there solo.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.711
Paola, why didn't you
tell the police all this?

10:04.745 --> 10:06.413
Because I don't trust the policía!

10:06.447 --> 10:08.748
Some of them are still
in bed with the cartels,

10:08.783 --> 10:11.017
letting them run drugs
and scams on tourists.

10:11.051 --> 10:13.987
And it wouldn't have changed anything.

10:14.021 --> 10:17.724
Now Drew is gone, and
all our dreams with it.

10:24.365 --> 10:27.400
I processed the roof. There's
no signs of a struggle.

10:27.435 --> 10:29.903
It's also none of the
emotion of a suicide, either.

10:29.937 --> 10:30.970
What are you trying to say?

10:31.005 --> 10:32.939
Well, most people
committing suicide will stop.

10:32.973 --> 10:33.840
They'll think for a moment.

10:33.874 --> 10:35.909
They'll have some sort of a hesitation.

10:35.943 --> 10:37.911
Take off their glasses,
fold their jacket,

10:37.945 --> 10:40.079
check their lipstick
one last time, et cetera.

10:40.114 --> 10:41.080
But not Drew.

10:41.115 --> 10:42.348
Security report says

10:42.383 --> 10:44.050
that roof door alarm was triggered,

10:44.084 --> 10:46.052
and 12 seconds later, he hit the ground.

10:46.086 --> 10:47.987
There was no note, no hesitation.

10:48.923 --> 10:50.089
Proves nothing.

10:50.124 --> 10:51.958
Not one person is the same.

10:51.992 --> 10:54.093
That's true, but there
are certain patterns

10:54.128 --> 10:56.930
that we all share when it
comes to our self-preservation,

10:56.964 --> 10:58.598
even when we think we want to die.

10:58.632 --> 10:59.766
In my experience,

10:59.800 --> 11:03.436
people do strange things out
of character all the time.

11:03.471 --> 11:05.071
Completely agreed,

11:05.105 --> 11:06.306
especially when they're
under the influence

11:06.340 --> 11:08.141
of drugs or alcohol, but...

11:08.175 --> 11:09.075
The autopsy showed

11:09.109 --> 11:11.110
that there were no
drugs in Drew's system,

11:11.145 --> 11:12.312
and the alcohol that he had consumed

11:12.346 --> 11:13.746
the night before barely registered.

11:13.781 --> 11:15.148
Detective Benavides,
have you had any luck

11:15.182 --> 11:16.449
getting surveillance footage

11:16.484 --> 11:17.817
of Drew's ATM or bank withdrawals?

11:17.852 --> 11:19.333
Sí, sí, sí. Claro que sí.

11:19.358 --> 11:21.120
I'll pull it up on one
of the hotel computers.

11:31.298 --> 11:32.465
You all right, Clara?

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
Yeah.

11:33.534 --> 11:34.434
Sorry.

11:34.468 --> 11:37.070
Paola just reminded
me of the helplessness

11:37.104 --> 11:39.472
that I felt when I lost Brad.

11:39.507 --> 11:40.940
Of course.

11:40.975 --> 11:43.009
If we can find out who did this to Drew,

11:43.043 --> 11:46.012
it's gonna give her closure,
allow her to move on.

11:46.046 --> 11:47.847
I hope we can do that.

11:47.882 --> 11:49.082
We will.

11:53.654 --> 11:55.688
No, no, no. Cerrado.

11:55.723 --> 11:57.524
We're closed until 6:00.

11:57.558 --> 11:58.992
FBI.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.061
I was hoping you might
be able to help us out.

12:03.230 --> 12:04.564
I doubt that.

12:05.733 --> 12:08.468
Let's give it a try, anyway.

12:08.502 --> 12:11.372
Either of you see this man last night?

12:12.806 --> 12:15.108
Ahh!

12:15.142 --> 12:18.177
I don't know. We see a lot of people.

12:18.212 --> 12:20.280
All those people end up dead?

12:22.049 --> 12:24.050
No dar papaya.

12:24.084 --> 12:26.119
"Don't give the papaya"?

12:26.153 --> 12:29.155
It's a local saying. It means...

12:29.189 --> 12:31.691
That it was probably
the guy's own damn fault

12:31.725 --> 12:35.061
for walking in yesterday,
being gringo, and flashing cash.

12:35.095 --> 12:36.796
And maybe you helped him out with that?

12:38.832 --> 12:40.133
¿Yo?

12:41.835 --> 12:44.504
You Americans are
always putting your noses

12:44.538 --> 12:45.905
in Colombian business

12:45.940 --> 12:47.504
and just making everything worse.

12:47.529 --> 12:50.176
Why don't you stop deflecting
and answer my question?

12:50.210 --> 12:52.245
Ohh.

12:52.279 --> 12:54.213
Mira.

12:54.248 --> 12:58.885
Tough guy with his gun and his badge.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.568
Now I'm just a tough guy.

13:17.008 --> 13:18.204
But a little piece of tin

13:18.238 --> 13:20.073
doesn't seem like it
would be a problem for you.

13:20.107 --> 13:24.010
Hermano... you don't want any of this.

13:24.044 --> 13:28.114
Big guy like you, doesn't
have many real fights.

13:28.148 --> 13:31.184
Your game is intimidation.

13:31.218 --> 13:33.419
Most people back down before
a punch is ever thrown,

13:33.454 --> 13:35.088
but I'm not one of those guys.

13:35.122 --> 13:38.591
So... you have anything to
do with this man's death?

13:43.397 --> 13:44.983
Okay.

13:45.008 --> 13:47.015
Yeah, okay?

13:47.550 --> 13:49.251
Look...

13:49.903 --> 13:51.904
I tried to talk to his lady.

13:51.939 --> 13:54.240
That's it... Hmm?

13:54.274 --> 13:57.877
I was here all night
into the morning, working.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.914
You don't believe me? Ask him.

14:01.949 --> 14:03.983
Doesn't mean you didn't
get on your walkie

14:04.018 --> 14:06.252
and call one of your
buddies to take care of him.

14:06.286 --> 14:09.722
- I am just...
- Whoa.

14:09.757 --> 14:11.224
Suave.

14:15.195 --> 14:17.997
It doesn't work. It's not even loaded.

14:18.032 --> 14:21.934
I am just a security guard.

14:21.969 --> 14:24.303
The walkie and the gun are a ruse.

14:24.338 --> 14:26.239
So...

14:26.273 --> 14:28.808
If people think, you're
part of the drug cartels,

14:28.842 --> 14:31.244
they think twice before
doing anything stupid?

14:34.148 --> 14:36.249
Welcome to Colombia.

14:42.356 --> 14:44.857
Nothing about his
behavior suggests stress.

14:44.892 --> 14:47.889
Mm. It doesn't look like
he's being coerced at all.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.763
Which supports the original
investigation was correct.

14:50.798 --> 14:53.332
Does this guy look like he's
about to jump off a roof to you?

14:53.367 --> 14:55.668
No. But it doesn't look
like he's being forced

14:55.703 --> 14:57.203
to empty his bank account, either.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.140
What's up, Monty?

15:01.175 --> 15:03.843
I just flagged Timothy
Hulse, 58, Canadian.

15:03.877 --> 15:05.484
Registered at a hotel
right down the street

15:05.509 --> 15:07.513
from our first victim, Drew.

15:07.548 --> 15:10.216
Also, Tim just emptied his bank account

15:10.250 --> 15:12.885
from the same bank, nearly $10,000.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.188
- That's a lot of pocket change.
- Where?

15:15.222 --> 15:17.890
Right around the corner
from your current location.

15:17.925 --> 15:20.193
FBI! Everybody clear!

15:20.227 --> 15:21.360
Clear out!

15:31.004 --> 15:32.972
It's Tim Hulse.

15:38.902 --> 15:40.735
Thank you for allowing me to examine

15:40.769 --> 15:43.438
our most recent victim on
our plane, Coroner Falcao.

15:43.472 --> 15:46.274
You know, due to your time constraint

15:46.308 --> 15:48.209
and our overflow of cases,

15:48.243 --> 15:50.545
I think this is the most
effective way to proceed.

15:50.579 --> 15:52.146
Of course.

15:55.617 --> 15:59.120
Witnesses said that he
stepped into traffic...

15:59.154 --> 16:00.755
Committed suicide.

16:00.789 --> 16:02.423
So, what do you hope to find?

16:02.458 --> 16:05.893
An answer to why
someone would go against

16:05.928 --> 16:08.663
every survival instinct that they have.

16:10.732 --> 16:11.726
The victim was not alone

16:11.751 --> 16:14.402
but accompanied to
Colombia by his wife, Amber.

16:14.436 --> 16:15.470
Where is she?

16:15.504 --> 16:16.471
I don't know.

16:16.505 --> 16:17.638
Then let's find her. Pronto.

16:17.673 --> 16:20.408
This might be an escalation
from "express kidnapping"

16:20.442 --> 16:22.410
to a more classic
kidnapping with a ransom.

16:22.444 --> 16:24.612
Yeah, it would explain
why the missus went M.I.A.

16:24.646 --> 16:26.280
And why the bank account was emptied.

16:26.315 --> 16:27.648
But not why he killed himself.

16:27.683 --> 16:29.617
Unless it was his life or hers.

16:29.651 --> 16:31.657
Did the victims have
any connection, Monty?

16:31.682 --> 16:33.588
They were both were visiting Bogotá,

16:33.622 --> 16:35.756
both used the same ATM, which
is the only one within a mile.

16:35.791 --> 16:38.125
Outside of that, Drew was an American...

16:38.160 --> 16:39.126
Tim is a Canuck.

16:39.161 --> 16:41.829
So, the unsub is targeting
not only Americans,

16:41.864 --> 16:42.507
but foreigners.

16:42.532 --> 16:44.265
More specifically, tourists.

16:44.299 --> 16:46.100
And if Tim Hulse emptied
out his bank account,

16:46.134 --> 16:48.636
walked outside, and then
within five minutes, he's dead,

16:48.670 --> 16:50.238
why didn't we find any money on him?

16:50.272 --> 16:51.772
Maybe he passed it off to someone.

16:51.807 --> 16:53.674
That would have to be
pretty quick and organized

16:53.709 --> 16:54.575
seeing that there's no
witnesses or footage.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.477
This is Colombia.

16:56.512 --> 16:58.346
Unlike America, we are limited

16:58.380 --> 17:00.414
with surveillance
cameras around the city.

17:00.449 --> 17:03.451
Besides the bank cameras...

17:03.485 --> 17:05.392
Which I'm looking at now.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.622
The footage shows that Tim left

17:07.656 --> 17:08.656
and there's nothing out of the ordinary.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.156
If I didn't know any better,

17:10.192 --> 17:11.626
it'd look like he was
going on a Sunday stroll.

17:21.803 --> 17:24.372
If anyone was taken, it wasn't here.

17:24.406 --> 17:25.839
There's no signs of struggle.

17:25.874 --> 17:29.644
Monty, how old is Mrs. Hulse?

17:29.678 --> 17:32.813
According to her Canadian
passport, 58. Why?

17:32.848 --> 17:34.315
What does she do for a living?

17:34.349 --> 17:36.183
The Hulses reported their occupations

17:36.218 --> 17:37.985
on their visitor declaration form.

17:38.020 --> 17:41.722
Tim was an accountant. Amber
is a third-grade teacher.

17:41.757 --> 17:42.757
Why?

17:42.791 --> 17:46.127
So, what are the odds
that a third-grade teacher

17:46.161 --> 17:49.130
is using purple lipstick
with glitter in it?

17:49.164 --> 17:51.032
Towels are still wet...

17:51.066 --> 17:53.167
and there's red hair in the drain.

17:53.201 --> 17:55.736
I am willing to bet that
Mrs. Hulse is not a...

17:55.771 --> 17:56.837
She's a brunet.

17:56.872 --> 17:59.232
So why was there another
woman in this hotel room?

17:59.257 --> 18:01.475
More importantly, is she our unsub?

18:01.510 --> 18:03.144
Jack, after Tim's untimely death,

18:03.178 --> 18:04.426
I started tracking his credit cards,

18:04.451 --> 18:06.047
and I just got a hit that
someone tried to use it

18:06.081 --> 18:07.048
in a shop nearby.

18:07.082 --> 18:08.983
It could be the people
that have Mrs. Hulse.

18:09.008 --> 18:10.461
Monty, send the coordinates to my phone.

18:10.486 --> 18:11.752
I'm coming with you.

18:15.424 --> 18:17.703
I hope you don't take offense to this,

18:17.728 --> 18:21.228
but in Colombia, not many
women become medical examiners.

18:21.263 --> 18:23.230
In fact, I've never worked with one.

18:23.265 --> 18:23.965
You're my first.

18:23.990 --> 18:25.866
Well, hopefully, I'm
doing the ladies proud

18:25.901 --> 18:29.103
because I have an international
reputation to uphold.

18:29.137 --> 18:29.808
Really?

18:29.833 --> 18:30.972
Um, no.

18:31.006 --> 18:32.940
I just like the way that sounds.

18:32.975 --> 18:35.534
You're funny, too.

18:35.589 --> 18:37.457
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm the whole package.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.459
So, what makes a young, happy woman

18:39.493 --> 18:40.994
go into the business of death?

18:41.028 --> 18:43.096
Well, I was in med school,

18:43.130 --> 18:45.732
and I wasn't exactly sure
what I wanted to do yet,

18:45.766 --> 18:48.635
and then I got my first cadaver.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.637
And she was my age.

18:50.671 --> 18:54.140
And I found myself
wanting to know her story.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.576
And as I started to work on her,

18:56.610 --> 18:59.813
it unfolded right in front of me.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.949
Her body was telling me exactly what

19:02.983 --> 19:05.618
the last few moments of her life were.

19:05.653 --> 19:08.121
You realized the dead can talk.

19:08.155 --> 19:09.789
Sí.

19:09.824 --> 19:13.660
So I... figured, if I became an M.E.,

19:13.694 --> 19:16.639
I could help them find some peace,

19:17.231 --> 19:18.898
maybe even some justice.

19:25.072 --> 19:29.008
Doctor, I think we have a full bladder.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.244
That's unusual.

19:35.349 --> 19:37.617
So there's a receptor antagonist

19:37.651 --> 19:39.719
that blocked the excitatory effect

19:39.754 --> 19:42.188
of the ACh on the detrusor muscle.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.817
I think we know what we're dealing with.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.663
Hey. I just got off the
phone with the embassy.

19:50.698 --> 19:54.067
They're issuing a travel warning
to all Americans in Bogotá

19:54.101 --> 19:55.668
and a warning to other embassies

19:55.703 --> 19:57.070
to do the same for their citizens.

19:57.104 --> 19:58.371
Good. Simmons just called.

19:58.406 --> 20:01.841
He found the person of interest
using the Hulses' credit card.

20:01.876 --> 20:04.644
It turned out to be Mrs. Hulse herself.

20:04.678 --> 20:07.313
Seems she had breakfast
with her husband this morning

20:07.348 --> 20:10.216
before she went on the
Zipaquirá Salt Cathedral tour

20:10.251 --> 20:12.352
while he came back to the hotel to rest.

20:12.386 --> 20:14.354
So, whoever it was

20:14.388 --> 20:16.656
must have known that she'd be occupied.

20:16.690 --> 20:18.191
What do you got, Mae?

20:18.225 --> 20:19.759
Well, the original medical reports

20:19.794 --> 20:21.227
said that the victims were not drugged,

20:21.262 --> 20:22.595
when, in fact, they were.

20:22.630 --> 20:23.730
With what?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.565
It's called scopolamine,

20:25.599 --> 20:27.700
A.K.A. "The Devil's Breath."

20:27.735 --> 20:29.436
So, why didn't the
original labs catch it?

20:29.470 --> 20:32.705
Well, scopolamine metabolizes
into the bloodstream so quickly

20:32.740 --> 20:35.008
that standard toxic
panels don't detect it.

20:35.042 --> 20:37.343
It also grows only here in Colombia,

20:37.378 --> 20:39.379
so it's specific to the region.

20:39.413 --> 20:40.413
Bingo.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.783
Now, scopolamine is like
a Mickey on steroids.

20:43.818 --> 20:46.886
It's odorless, it's off-white in color,

20:46.921 --> 20:48.955
and it can be blown into someone's face

20:48.989 --> 20:50.723
or just passed on through touch.

20:50.758 --> 20:52.759
Once this happens, the victim is turned

20:52.793 --> 20:55.028
into a complete mental zombie,

20:55.062 --> 20:58.698
and the memory process
to the brain is blocked.

20:58.732 --> 21:00.200
And while they're under the influence,

21:00.234 --> 21:02.802
the victim is easily controlled

21:02.837 --> 21:05.205
by suggestions or verbal commands

21:05.239 --> 21:07.307
to perform unspeakable acts,

21:07.341 --> 21:09.709
which is why all of our victims

21:09.743 --> 21:11.878
have been emptying
their bank accounts...

21:11.912 --> 21:13.780
Because they were told to.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.448
And the person giving the commands

21:15.483 --> 21:17.917
is usually very close by.

21:17.952 --> 21:19.586
And once the drug has worn off,

21:19.620 --> 21:22.822
the victim has no
recollection of what's happened

21:22.857 --> 21:24.958
or what they did under the influence.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.393
They can't even identify the people that

21:27.428 --> 21:29.229
gave them the drug in the first place.

21:29.263 --> 21:31.097
Well, then why have them kill themselves

21:31.131 --> 21:32.899
if they can't remember anything, anyway?

21:32.933 --> 21:35.735
Unless these crimes of opportunity

21:35.769 --> 21:38.638
are also a way to
fulfill a lust to kill.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.306
Sounds like you're on to something, Mae.

21:40.341 --> 21:43.943
Get back to the hotel as soon
as possible, and we'll regroup.

21:45.379 --> 21:47.413
The last time I heard of scopolamine,

21:47.448 --> 21:49.616
a bunch of working girls were using it

21:49.650 --> 21:51.117
to roll Johns on Guatemala.

21:51.151 --> 21:52.685
Well, a lady of the night would explain

21:52.720 --> 21:54.754
who was drinking the champagne.

21:54.788 --> 21:56.489
And who took the shower

21:56.524 --> 21:59.659
in a country where running
water is not always a given.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.294
Yeah, but neither of these victims

22:01.328 --> 22:03.630
look like the kind of men
that would pay for sex.

22:03.664 --> 22:06.799
Agreed, but maybe
they didn't pay for it,

22:06.834 --> 22:08.334
and these women followed them

22:08.369 --> 22:10.436
and found the right
opportunity to dose them.

22:10.471 --> 22:12.472
All right, so where do
we find this working girl?

22:12.506 --> 22:14.974
That's the easy part.

22:15.009 --> 22:17.010
Simmons, meet us at the Wall.

22:36.430 --> 22:38.665
The Wall's infamous for prostitution.

22:41.702 --> 22:44.404
There she is. Redhead, purple lipstick.

22:44.438 --> 22:45.305
Check.

22:45.339 --> 22:47.840
Nice ice on her finger.

22:47.875 --> 22:51.044
I think we just found Drew's
lost engagement ring...

22:51.078 --> 22:52.145
and his killer.

22:54.181 --> 22:55.615
Go, go!

22:57.017 --> 22:58.051
Aah!

23:07.450 --> 23:09.785
I don't have a shot.

23:09.819 --> 23:11.687
There's too many innocents downrange.

23:18.895 --> 23:20.629
- There she goes!
- I'll get his attention.

23:20.663 --> 23:22.698
As soon as I draw his
fire, you get the girl.

23:22.732 --> 23:23.598
Copy.

23:25.319 --> 23:27.254
Simmons, you get
everyone else to safety.

23:27.279 --> 23:28.613
Done.

23:31.007 --> 23:31.907
Go!

23:31.941 --> 23:35.243
Come on. Clear, clear,
clear, clear, clear!

23:35.278 --> 23:37.379
Go, go, go! Go, go! Clear, clear!

23:57.767 --> 23:59.301
Jack Garrett, FBI!

23:59.335 --> 24:00.936
What do we got, Jack?

24:02.839 --> 24:06.441
He's on a drug called scopolamine.

24:07.643 --> 24:08.910
It's like you're under hypnosis,

24:08.945 --> 24:10.011
so whoever gives it to you

24:10.046 --> 24:11.279
has a lot of sway

24:11.314 --> 24:12.647
over your actions.

24:17.286 --> 24:18.553
Aah!

24:20.723 --> 24:21.757
FBI! Stop!

24:37.073 --> 24:38.940
Aah!

24:40.042 --> 24:42.310
How'd he know where to find us?

24:44.547 --> 24:46.348
The unsub is watching.

24:53.990 --> 24:56.057
What's your name?

24:56.092 --> 24:57.112
Canela.

24:57.159 --> 24:59.581
But why am I here? I did nothing.

24:59.606 --> 25:00.996
Then why did you run?

25:01.030 --> 25:02.531
Someone was shooting.

25:02.565 --> 25:03.498
After that,

25:03.533 --> 25:06.081
when I identified myself
as law enforcement.

25:06.106 --> 25:07.473
Instinct.

25:07.498 --> 25:09.299
Innocent people don't run.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.914
You police are all the same,

25:10.948 --> 25:12.916
deciding who's innocent and who's not.

25:12.950 --> 25:15.351
I am not the Colombian police.

25:15.386 --> 25:17.787
You help me, maybe I can help you.

25:17.822 --> 25:19.522
- ¿Ayudarme?
- Sí.

25:21.659 --> 25:24.027
Who cares about las
prostitutas in Bogotá?

25:24.061 --> 25:26.529
What I care about, Canela, is the truth.

25:26.564 --> 25:28.465
If you tell it, I can help you.

25:28.499 --> 25:31.568
If not, you go take your chances
with the Bogotá Policía.

25:33.504 --> 25:35.572
What do you want to know?

25:35.606 --> 25:37.741
Within the last 24 hours,

25:37.775 --> 25:39.743
you were hired by two tourists.

25:39.777 --> 25:40.810
Sí.

25:40.845 --> 25:43.546
And they both brought you
back to their hotel rooms.

25:43.581 --> 25:44.314
Sí.

25:44.348 --> 25:45.515
Once you were alone with them,

25:45.549 --> 25:48.651
you used The Devil's Breath
to take them under your control

25:48.686 --> 25:50.887
and manipulate them out of their money.

25:50.921 --> 25:51.688
¿Qué?

25:51.722 --> 25:53.423
After you were finished with them,

25:53.457 --> 25:55.492
you ordered them to take their own lives

25:55.526 --> 25:56.760
to cover your tracks.

25:56.794 --> 25:57.584
No!

25:57.609 --> 25:58.995
Finally, you took the shooter,

25:59.029 --> 26:00.146
and you did the exact same thing,

26:00.171 --> 26:02.098
but instead of ordering
him to kill himself,

26:02.133 --> 26:04.000
you ordered him to kill
my teammate Jack Garrett

26:04.034 --> 26:05.602
because we were getting too close.

26:05.636 --> 26:06.436
INada! IMentiras!

26:06.470 --> 26:08.838
Not lies, Canela! It's the truth!

26:08.873 --> 26:10.899
If I told you the truth,
you wouldn't believe me.

26:10.924 --> 26:12.308
Try me!

26:12.343 --> 26:14.177
Sí, both turistas y gringos

26:14.211 --> 26:17.247
hired me for the night,
but neither wanted sexo.

26:18.716 --> 26:19.649
What did they want?

26:19.683 --> 26:23.620
Por extraño que parezca,
they wanted nothing.

26:23.654 --> 26:25.955
They fed me, told me to shower,

26:25.990 --> 26:27.257
and then paid me for the whole day

26:27.291 --> 26:28.925
so I didn't have to work anymore.

26:28.959 --> 26:31.161
The one guy even gave me this ring.

26:31.195 --> 26:34.597
I know this all sounds loco,
but what am I supposed to do?

26:34.632 --> 26:36.499
Not take the money? Not take the ring?

26:36.534 --> 26:37.467
I got to eat.

26:37.501 --> 26:40.970
So what about the
gunman? What did he want?

26:41.005 --> 26:42.105
I never met him.

26:42.139 --> 26:43.640
When he came and started shooting,

26:43.674 --> 26:45.508
that was the first time I ever saw him.

26:45.543 --> 26:47.510
I swear on el mismo Jesucristo.

26:50.548 --> 26:52.715
Mae and Simmons are
interviewing the shooter.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.651
How'd it go with our working girl?

26:54.685 --> 26:56.686
She says she's innocent.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.300
Of course.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.456
I believe her, Jack.

27:00.758 --> 27:01.791
Why's that?

27:01.826 --> 27:04.327
Well, because when people
lie, they tend to minimize,

27:04.361 --> 27:06.563
you know, to conceal their
degree of involvement,

27:06.597 --> 27:08.665
but Canela has admitted to everything,

27:08.699 --> 27:11.129
including things that would
cast doubt on her story,

27:11.170 --> 27:13.403
like the fact that they
paid her extra money

27:13.428 --> 27:15.247
or that Drew gave her the ring.

27:15.406 --> 27:17.540
Her only crime is growing
up on these streets

27:17.575 --> 27:19.008
and trying to survive.

27:19.043 --> 27:21.644
So, if she didn't do it

27:21.679 --> 27:24.681
whoever our unsub is
has a soft spot for her.

27:24.715 --> 27:25.748
Agreed.

27:25.783 --> 27:28.418
And they want her washed,
fed, and off the streets.

27:28.452 --> 27:30.742
But it's, a conflicting motivation...

27:30.767 --> 27:32.655
Greed versus romance?

27:32.690 --> 27:35.058
Could be dealing with a schizophrenic,

27:35.092 --> 27:36.559
someone of two minds,

27:36.594 --> 27:38.862
on the one hand, driven by logic...

27:38.896 --> 27:41.364
On the other, driven by emotion.

27:41.398 --> 27:44.434
Which could be a blessing.

27:44.468 --> 27:47.070
I mean, the emotional side of our unsub

27:47.104 --> 27:48.738
is driving them to take risks

27:48.772 --> 27:50.373
that they normally wouldn't take.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.709
Exactly. Which could be their undoing.

27:52.743 --> 27:54.777
Or their common thread.

27:54.812 --> 27:58.648
Canela asked me, "Who cares
for prostitutes in Bogotá?"

28:00.217 --> 28:03.419
Someone else who's been thrown away.

28:04.967 --> 28:06.589
I what?

28:06.624 --> 28:08.791
You got to be kidding me. I had a gun?

28:08.826 --> 28:10.420
Where would I get a gun?

28:10.445 --> 28:12.195
We found this on you.

28:12.229 --> 28:13.730
Where'd you get it?

28:13.764 --> 28:14.898
Well, who's this?

28:14.932 --> 28:16.532
I've never seen this guy before.

28:16.567 --> 28:18.935
It's okay, sir. We believe you.

28:18.969 --> 28:19.736
You do?

28:19.770 --> 28:22.372
Yeah, we think that you were drugged.

28:22.406 --> 28:24.707
I'm taking a sample
right now to confirm.

28:24.742 --> 28:26.029
Well, how?

28:26.054 --> 28:28.945
Well, that is what we
are trying to figure out.

28:28.979 --> 28:30.613
What's the last thing you remember?

28:30.648 --> 28:33.783
Uh, I decided to take a walk

28:33.817 --> 28:35.464
from my hotel down to the marketplace.

28:35.489 --> 28:36.790
Then...

28:41.592 --> 28:42.558
"Redemption Song?"

28:42.593 --> 28:44.093
Yeah, that's what I remember.

28:44.128 --> 28:46.262
I put some money into the...

28:46.297 --> 28:48.097
The Kid Musician's hat.

28:49.300 --> 28:51.701
And then everything went dark.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.976
Thank you.

29:00.010 --> 29:03.112
Papaya, señorita? Please?

29:03.147 --> 29:04.247
Papaya?

29:11.889 --> 29:12.822
Here you go.

29:16.327 --> 29:18.816
- Music.
- The Polaroid of Jack.

29:18.841 --> 29:19.762
The marketplace...

29:19.797 --> 29:21.950
It's what all the vics had in common.

29:21.975 --> 29:23.638
The Chico Reservado district

29:23.663 --> 29:25.501
is very popular among the tourists.

29:25.536 --> 29:27.470
They walk through here every single day.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.105
And finally the kids.

29:29.139 --> 29:30.039
They're everywhere.

29:30.074 --> 29:32.842
The poor and homeless
are often invisible.

29:32.876 --> 29:34.978
Yeah, that's why this crime
was so hard to figure out.

29:35.012 --> 29:36.012
We underestimated them.

29:36.046 --> 29:37.447
Yeah, because you don't want to believe

29:37.481 --> 29:39.515
that kids are capable of such a thing.

29:53.731 --> 29:55.298
Doesn't mean he's our unsub.

29:55.332 --> 29:57.734
He looks like the ringleader to me.

29:57.768 --> 29:58.864
He just may be,

29:58.889 --> 30:01.746
but let's kick the tires
on this and be sure.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.841
Our unsub is targeting tourists.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.364
These are crimes of opportunity,

30:06.389 --> 30:08.878
but there's, a sadistic element to them.

30:08.912 --> 30:10.413
Robbery should have been enough,

30:10.447 --> 30:11.881
but these murders are extra.

30:11.915 --> 30:14.717
This person wants control, craves power.

30:14.752 --> 30:16.919
I-It's not just about money,

30:16.954 --> 30:19.722
but about making his
victims be punished.

30:19.757 --> 30:23.034
This is someone who's angry
at tourists or foreigners.

30:23.059 --> 30:24.994
Yeah, a domineering personality,

30:25.029 --> 30:26.829
someone who takes pleasure

30:26.864 --> 30:29.565
in... in making their victims helpless.

30:32.269 --> 30:34.337
This kid doesn't fit the profile.

30:34.371 --> 30:36.873
So what? He fits the crime.

30:40.811 --> 30:42.545
See, look at the way he checks around.

30:42.579 --> 30:43.613
See?

30:43.647 --> 30:45.948
See right there?

30:45.983 --> 30:48.184
Before he gives the kid the money.

30:48.218 --> 30:49.886
They're afraid of someone.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.954
So he's got nothing to do with this?

30:51.989 --> 30:53.577
He might not be our unsub,

30:53.616 --> 30:55.958
but he's most definitely our Romeo.

30:55.993 --> 30:58.861
Strawberries, champagne, and a shower.

30:58.896 --> 31:01.864
Only a kid on the street
who lacks these things

31:01.899 --> 31:03.032
is gonna know their value.

31:03.067 --> 31:03.966
How is that possible?

31:04.001 --> 31:06.903
Whoever is tied into
protecting this girl

31:06.937 --> 31:09.038
is most likely the person
who did all of this.

31:09.073 --> 31:10.507
Unless we're looking for two people...

31:10.532 --> 31:12.241
One Alpha and one Beta.

31:12.276 --> 31:14.577
Which is why our profile
was so conflicting.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.879
These kids are just puppets.

31:16.914 --> 31:18.781
Someone else is pulling the strings,

31:18.816 --> 31:20.783
giving information from afar.

31:20.818 --> 31:22.885
So we're not looking for a Romeo.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.821
We're looking for a Cyrano.

31:24.855 --> 31:28.026
So, how do we find this Cyrano?

31:30.260 --> 31:32.662
First, let's get these
kids off the street

31:32.696 --> 31:34.931
and to safety.

31:38.669 --> 31:39.902
iLa policía!

31:39.937 --> 31:41.137
iCorran! iCorran!

31:47.678 --> 31:48.311
Hey.

31:48.345 --> 31:49.979
FBI.

31:50.013 --> 31:51.981
¿Hablas inglés?

31:52.015 --> 31:52.849
Sí.

31:52.883 --> 31:54.317
Where'd you learn to speak English?

31:54.351 --> 31:55.818
Where else?

31:55.853 --> 31:57.520
American music.

31:57.554 --> 31:58.821
He's clean.

31:58.856 --> 32:00.923
Which means I'm free to go. Gracias.

32:00.958 --> 32:03.192
No, no, no, no.

32:03.227 --> 32:03.759
They're all clean.

32:03.794 --> 32:04.760
One of the other kids

32:04.795 --> 32:06.796
must have gotten away
with the scopolamine.

32:06.830 --> 32:09.165
I'm not interested in you going to jail,

32:09.199 --> 32:11.598
but I am interested in who your boss is.

32:11.623 --> 32:13.136
I'm the boss.

32:13.170 --> 32:16.339
I think you're just a
kid being manipulated.

32:16.373 --> 32:20.476
You don't know anything about
me or my friends or my family.

32:20.511 --> 32:24.714
Well, I know whoever you
think your friend is, isn't.

32:24.748 --> 32:26.115
They're using you and all the others

32:26.150 --> 32:27.316
to do bad things

32:27.351 --> 32:30.820
so that, if you get caught,
you all go to jail, not them.

32:30.854 --> 32:33.623
The FBI likes to lie.

32:33.657 --> 32:35.892
I promise you, we're not
lying. Let me help you.

32:36.501 --> 32:38.828
I know you're just trying
to take care of your friends.

32:38.862 --> 32:40.454
We're okay.

32:40.479 --> 32:42.632
We'll take care of ourselves.

32:42.666 --> 32:44.901
Gracias.

32:44.935 --> 32:47.870
iVámonos!

32:52.409 --> 32:53.509
So, what now?

32:55.112 --> 32:56.979
We follow them.

33:25.275 --> 33:28.211
Well, they can't have
escaped that quickly.

33:43.336 --> 33:44.491
Got 'em.

33:48.165 --> 33:51.133
Yeah, they can fit
in here, but we can't.

33:51.168 --> 33:53.135
Need to find another way in.

33:53.170 --> 33:56.572
They're probably meeting
with their leader now.

33:56.607 --> 33:58.975
I'm pretty sure this
leads under the hotel.

33:59.009 --> 34:01.244
Maybe there's a way in from there.

34:05.849 --> 34:09.351
Everyone worked real hard today.

34:11.170 --> 34:12.170
Aah!

34:34.600 --> 34:42.683
_

34:44.774 --> 34:48.077
Finally a chance to be the conquerors

34:48.110 --> 34:50.446
instead of the conquered!

34:50.476 --> 34:55.254
_

34:56.753 --> 35:00.089
The FBI is not here for Canela.

35:01.124 --> 35:03.926
They're here because
you killed all those men!

35:05.161 --> 35:07.059
Now kill yourself.

35:07.098 --> 35:10.015
_

35:10.133 --> 35:12.534
They all could have been
traced back to Canela...

35:12.563 --> 35:20.127
_

35:20.310 --> 35:21.110
What?

35:21.188 --> 35:22.859
_

35:22.898 --> 35:23.531
No!

35:24.375 --> 35:28.203
_

35:30.654 --> 35:33.722
But Canela was our family!

35:33.781 --> 35:35.859
_

35:35.959 --> 35:37.092
She had to go.

35:37.127 --> 35:40.129
We... We all loved her like a sister.

35:40.163 --> 35:42.264
And what about me?

35:42.299 --> 35:43.332
Huh?!

35:43.366 --> 35:47.036
You were all nothing but
rats living in a sewer!

35:47.070 --> 35:49.872
I brought you here! I gave you all this!

35:49.906 --> 35:52.041
I gave you a family, a home!

35:52.075 --> 35:56.378
No! You say all that, but
you treat us skinny dogs!

35:56.413 --> 35:59.114
And when you don't need us,
you're gonna throw us out, too!

36:01.418 --> 36:02.624
Like you did with Canela.

36:02.649 --> 36:03.719
Shut up!

36:06.089 --> 36:07.623
FBI! Drop the weapon!

36:10.160 --> 36:11.627
I said, drop the weapon!

36:11.673 --> 36:12.992
_

36:27.243 --> 36:28.510
Okay...

36:44.260 --> 36:46.395
Her name was Gabriella Muñoz,

36:46.429 --> 36:49.258
ex-street kid and prostitute
with a long criminal record

36:49.283 --> 36:52.701
and a history of extreme
Colombian nationalistic views.

36:52.736 --> 36:55.204
So, how did she become
the hotel manager?

36:55.238 --> 36:57.940
Rosa Fernandez was an alias

36:57.974 --> 36:59.543
that she must have stolen
and used to get the job.

36:59.568 --> 37:00.609
The kids say

37:00.643 --> 37:03.178
that she had been planning
this scam for a while.

37:03.213 --> 37:05.080
A hotel manager's a perfect cover

37:05.115 --> 37:07.216
if you want to rip off some tourists.

37:07.250 --> 37:08.717
Yeah, and being surrounded by them

37:08.752 --> 37:09.952
must have triggered her resentment

37:09.986 --> 37:11.120
towards all the foreigners.

37:11.154 --> 37:14.100
And suddenly, it wasn't enough
to just steal from them...

37:14.125 --> 37:15.924
She needed to kill them, too.

37:15.959 --> 37:18.894
I owe you and your team an apology.

37:18.928 --> 37:21.630
I thought there was nothing here.

37:21.664 --> 37:24.099
You were right. There was.

37:24.134 --> 37:27.036
Well, this is one of those
times I wish I was wrong.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.304
Hopefully, in the
future, we can do more?

37:29.339 --> 37:30.906
Thank you.

37:33.309 --> 37:35.044
So, what about them?

37:37.247 --> 37:38.883
What happens now?

37:38.908 --> 37:41.187
Although they were part
of a criminal activity,

37:41.212 --> 37:43.752
I've spoken to my
superior on their behalf,

37:43.787 --> 37:46.121
and he's taken into
account their circumstances.

37:46.156 --> 37:48.724
They've been cleared of any wrongdoing.

37:48.758 --> 37:50.559
Well, I'm glad to hear that

37:50.593 --> 37:53.065
because I found someone who can help us.

37:54.297 --> 37:56.065
I have a friend who runs an orphanage.

37:59.202 --> 38:01.593
Hola, Jack.

38:01.618 --> 38:04.106
Thank you for coming, Ramona.

38:05.608 --> 38:07.342
The kids are right
over there with my team.

38:07.377 --> 38:08.377
I'll go introduce myself,

38:08.411 --> 38:11.213
and then we can take them
off to their new home.

38:13.183 --> 38:14.983
What would you have done if we decided

38:15.018 --> 38:16.351
to press charges against them?

38:16.386 --> 38:19.288
I guess we'll never
have to find that out.

38:29.219 --> 38:32.054
Um, I'm gonna be right back.

38:35.905 --> 38:36.905
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:36.940 --> 38:41.143
I, uh... I have something
that belongs to you.

38:41.177 --> 38:42.444
Oh, my God.

38:42.479 --> 38:44.947
