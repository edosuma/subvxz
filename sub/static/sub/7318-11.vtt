WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:01.767
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.800 --> 00:02.800
THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:02.833 --> 00:04.267
MEREDITH WON'T BE
AN ISSUE ANYMORE.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.333
SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE.
GOOD-BYE, DEREK.

00:06.367 --> 00:08.767
YOU COULD START THINKING
ABOUT MOVING IN WITH ME.
SHE'S CUTE
AND SHE LIKES YOU.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.600
YOU SHOULDN'T LET A LITTLE SYPH
GET IN THE WAY.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.667
I LIKE YOU, OLIVIA.
I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU ENOUGH.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.567
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
DOING IT NOW?

00:17.667 --> 00:19.233
YOU'RE MARRIED?

00:19.267 --> 00:21.200
I'M PREGNANT,
YOU BLIND MORON.

00:21.233 --> 00:22.567
HOW MUCH SODIUM
DID YOU GIVE HIM?

00:22.600 --> 00:24.733
500 cc OVER 4 HOURS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO
A FOLLOW-UP?

00:24.767 --> 00:26.800
I GAVE YOU ONE THING TO DO.
I HAVE A LOT TO TEACH

00:26.833 --> 00:28.333
IF YOU WANT TO LEARN.

00:28.367 --> 00:30.600
SO WHEN YOU DECIDE
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

00:30.633 --> 00:32.467
FOR YOU TO HATE ME,
LET ME KNOW.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.533
(Addison) DORIE RUSSELL,
SHE'S GIVING BIRTH TO QUINTS.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.167
(Izzie) WE'RE GONNA NEED
ALL THE HANDS WE CAN GET.

00:39.167 --> 00:40.500
(Meredith) 40 YEARS AGO,

00:40.533 --> 00:43.800
THE BEATLES ASKED THE WORLD
A SIMPLE QUESTION.

00:43.833 --> 00:47.733
HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE ALL
THE LONELY PEOPLE CAME FROM.

00:47.767 --> 00:49.133
MY LATEST THEORY IS THAT

00:49.167 --> 00:50.767
A GREAT MANY
OF THE LONELY PEOPLE

00:50.800 --> 00:52.700
COME FROM HOSPITALS.

00:52.733 --> 00:56.100
MORE PRECISELY,
THE SURGICAL WING OF HOSPITALS.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.600
I HAVE THE BEST QUINT.
LUCY--SHE JUST SMILED AT ME.

00:58.633 --> 01:00.300
SHE'S 9 HOURS OLD, GEORGE.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.633
I'M SAYIN'
THERE ARE FIVE BABIES HERE,

01:02.667 --> 01:05.433
AND CLEARLY,
MINE IS THE ADVANCED ONE.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.800
CHARLOTTE'S SMART.

01:06.833 --> 01:09.167
SHE'S GOT WRINKLES
ON HER FOREHEAD--VERY SERIOUS.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.700
OKAY, "A," THIS IS NOT
A COMPETITION,

01:11.733 --> 01:14.733
AND "B," MY QUINT KICKS
YOUR QUINTS' ASSES.

01:14.767 --> 01:16.433
EMILY'S STRONG,

01:16.467 --> 01:18.367
SHE WON'T LET GO
OF MY FINGER.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.233
HEY, JULIE HAS HER ORGANS
ON THE OUTSIDE OF HER BODY,

01:21.267 --> 01:23.167
AND SHE'S STILL ALIVE,
THANK YOU.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.567
KATE'S THE BEST ONE.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.400
IZZIE.

01:27.433 --> 01:28.367
LEAVE.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.800
CAN WE PLEASE JUST TALK?

01:29.833 --> 01:31.733
YOU'RE TOO BUSY
SCREWING NURSES TO TALK.

01:31.767 --> 01:33.667
JUST GET OUT.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.567
CAN SOMEONE MAKE SURE THAT
KATE'S VITALS REMAIN STABLE?

01:36.600 --> 01:38.733
I WILL.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.700
(Izzie)
HE IS UNBELIEVABLE.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.633
I AM SO GLAD
I NEVER SLEPT WITH HIM.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.667
WHICH IS HIS LOSS,
BECAUSE I'M REALLY GOOD IN BED--

01:45.700 --> 01:47.600
MIND-BLOWING--
MIND-BLOWINGLY GOOD IN BED.

01:47.633 --> 01:49.133
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SEDUCE US?

01:49.167 --> 01:51.400
AND THEN HE SLEEPS WITH
OLIVIA INSTEAD OF ME.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.367
OLIVIA.
HEY, I SLEPT WITH OLIVIA.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.800
YEAH? WELL, THEN YOU BOTH
HAVE BAD TASTE.

01:55.833 --> 01:58.667
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SAY
THAT YOU WEREN'T WARNED.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.867
ALEX HAS ALWAYS BEEN ALEX.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.067
YOU DODGED A BULLET, IZZ.
YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.433
WHY ARE YOU EVEN SURPRISED?

02:04.467 --> 02:07.233
YOU SLEEP WITH A SNAKE,
YOU GET BIT.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.533
THANKS, GUYS,

02:09.567 --> 02:11.433
FOR THE SUPPORT.

02:11.467 --> 02:14.067
WHO'S ON CALL TONIGHT?
I AM.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.067
ALL RIGHT, THE REST OF YOU
GO HOME, SLEEP.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.233
ALL FIVE QUINTS
ARE STILL ALIVE.

02:18.267 --> 02:19.767
IT'S A GOOD DAY.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.133
AS SURGEONS,
WE IGNORE OUR OWN NEEDS

02:23.167 --> 02:25.133
SO WE CAN MEET
OUR PATIENTS' NEEDS.

02:25.167 --> 02:27.800
WE IGNORE OUR FRIENDS
AND FAMILIES

02:27.833 --> 02:30.467
SO WE CAN SAVE OTHER PEOPLE'S
FRIENDS AND FAMILIES.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.667
WHICH MEANS THAT,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

02:32.700 --> 02:34.600
ALL WE REALLY HAVE
IS OURSELVES...

02:34.633 --> 02:36.800
***

02:36.833 --> 02:38.167
AND NOTHING IN THIS WORLD

02:38.200 --> 02:41.200
CAN MAKE YOU FEEL MORE ALONE
THAN THAT.

02:41.233 --> 02:44.133
***

02:46.733 --> 02:49.567
I MADE BREAKFAST.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.633
I-I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR BREAKFAST.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.567
I HAVE TO ROUND
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE DOES

02:53.600 --> 02:55.600
IF I WANT TO GET
THE GOOD CASES.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.133
YOU KNOW THAT.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.333
RIGHT.

02:58.367 --> 03:01.800
WELL, COFFEE?

03:14.767 --> 03:16.533
BYE.

03:19.167 --> 03:21.067
SO I WAS THINKING WE,
I MEAN, ME AND YOU COULD

03:21.100 --> 03:22.833
MAYBE, UH, GO TO JOE'S
LATER TO TALK BY OURSELVES.

03:22.867 --> 03:24.733
(Derek) WHY SHOULD I
BE THE ONE TO MOVE?

03:24.767 --> 03:27.133
(Addison) BECAUSE YOU LIVE
IN A GLORIFIED CAMPGROUND.

03:27.167 --> 03:28.767
IT'S 40 ACRES OF SOME OF
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND

03:28.800 --> 03:30.700
IN SEATTLE.
I DID NOT GIVE UP
A CENTRAL PARK BROWNSTONE

03:30.733 --> 03:32.233
TO COME LIVE IN THE FOREST.

03:32.267 --> 03:34.167
OUR HOUSE IN THE HAMPTONS
HAD TREES.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.733
YOU DIDN'T MIND THOSE TREES,
DID YOU?
THEY WERE THE HAMPTONS.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.667
WHY ARE YOU POINTING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

03:38.700 --> 03:40.600
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
UH, NOTHING.

03:40.633 --> 03:44.167
UGH. DOES ANYBODY HAVE
ANY DECENT FOOD?

03:44.200 --> 03:45.367
YOU REALLY SHOULD
EAT BREAKFAST.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.067
GOD, YOU SOUND LIKE BURKE.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.633
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK
WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH DOGS.

03:49.667 --> 03:50.733
THANKS.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.733
PREACHIN' TO THE CHOIR.
I'M OVER MEN.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.700
REAL NICE.

03:54.733 --> 03:58.067
YOU KNOW, A DOG IS NOT
A REPLACEMENT FOR A HUMAN BEING.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.567
YOU GUYS BETTER WAKE HER.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.733
IF BAILEY CATCHES HER SLEEPING,
SHE'S DEAD.

04:01.767 --> 04:03.733
IZZIE.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.233
IZZIE.

04:05.267 --> 04:06.200
WHAT?

04:06.233 --> 04:08.100
HELL HATH NO FURY
LIKE A GIRL

04:08.133 --> 04:10.800
WHOSE NON-BOYFRIEND
SCREWS A NURSE.

04:10.833 --> 04:11.767
BITCH.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.233
I LIKE YOU BETTER
PISSED OFF.

04:15.267 --> 04:18.467
YOU'RE ALMOST LIKE
A NORMAL PERSON NOW.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.333
OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

04:20.367 --> 04:22.300
UH, KARL MURPHY, 52.
MULTIPLE SKIN MELANOMAS.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.500
UNDERWENT
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY

04:23.533 --> 04:25.167
TO HIS NOSE, HIS RIGHT EAR,

04:25.200 --> 04:27.367
AS WELL AS A SKIN GRAFT
OF THE LEFT INDEX FINGER.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.133
(Miranda) HOW'S
THE CAPILLARY REFILL?

04:29.167 --> 04:30.600
IT'S SLOW.
ABOUT FOUR SECONDS.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.133
WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND

04:32.167 --> 04:34.733
TO GET THAT BLOOD
MOVING AGAIN, DR. O'MALLEY?

04:34.767 --> 04:36.600
AT THIS STAGE, OUR BEST OPTION

04:36.633 --> 04:38.567
IS PROBABLY
A BIOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.700
WH-WHAT IS THAT?

04:39.733 --> 04:42.500
WE PUT LEECHES
ON YOUR FACE.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.833
LEECHES?
HUH, YOU DON'T SAY?

04:44.867 --> 04:46.633
THEY SECRETE
BLOOD THINNERS

04:46.667 --> 04:49.533
THAT HELP BREAK UP POOLED BLOOD
SO IT CAN BE EVACUATED.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.367
IT'S SORT OF LIKE
A BIG DRAIN.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.367
LOOK, IF THIS
MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE--

04:53.400 --> 04:56.067
NO, NO, NO. I'VE BEEN
A HIKER FOR 40 YEARS.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.433
ALMOST 40 YEARS, YEAH.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.300
AND MOTHER NATURE HASN'T
COME UP WITH ANYTHING YET

04:59.333 --> 05:01.233
I HAVEN'T FOUND
A REASON TO LOVE.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.600
YOU A BIG OUTDOORSMAN?

05:03.633 --> 05:06.500
HOW DO YOU THINK I GOT ALL THESE
MELANOMAS IN THE FIRST PLACE?

05:06.533 --> 05:10.267
OH, DR. SHEPHERD,
YOU'RE IN EARLY.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.267
IF YOU'D LIKE US
TO COME BACK--
NO, GO AHEAD.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.233
(Meredith) ROBERT MARTIN, 45.
COLLAPSED AND HIT HIS HEAD,

05:14.267 --> 05:15.567
WHICH CAUSED
A SMALL SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.567
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.167
MR. MARTIN WAS FOUND TO HAVE
A RATHKE'S CLEFT CYST

05:20.200 --> 05:21.767
ON HIS PITUITARY,

05:21.800 --> 05:26.200
AND SURGERY WAS POSTPONED
WHEN...

05:26.233 --> 05:28.500
WHEN I TOLD A NURSE--
OLIVIA.

05:28.533 --> 05:30.100
WHEN I TOLD A NURSE
TO ADMINISTER

05:30.133 --> 05:32.067
AN INCORRECT DOSAGE
OF HYPERTONIC SALINE.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.533
ESSENTIALLY DEHYDRATING
MR. MARTIN'S BRAIN.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.167
HE STILL HAS A CHANCE.
HE COULD WAKE UP AND BE FINE.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.067
THERE'S A CHANCE.
I KNOW I SCREWED UP.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.833
JUST PUT ME BACK
ON THIS CASE, PLEASE.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.067
THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A CASE
LEFT HERE, DR. KAREV.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.633
YOU SAW TO THAT.
YOU WANT BACK ON THIS?

05:44.667 --> 05:46.100
BE MY GUEST.

06:01.233 --> 06:04.067
(Addison) OH, GOOD.
HERE YOU ARE.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.833
MOM AND DAD ARE ANXIOUS
FOR AN UPDATE.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.667
DR. YANG?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.600
(Cristina) WE'VE DONE
THE INITIAL SURGERY

06:09.633 --> 06:11.100
ON JULIE'S OMPHALOCELE.

06:11.133 --> 06:12.767
A PRIMARY CLOSURE
WAS ATTEMPTED,

06:12.800 --> 06:14.733
BUT THERE WAS
PULMONARY COMPROMISE,

06:14.767 --> 06:16.433
SO WE COULDN'T CONTIN--

06:16.467 --> 06:18.367
YANG, HOW ABOUT WE DO THIS
IN PLAIN ENGLISH?

06:18.400 --> 06:22.333
OH, UM, WE OPERATED ON JULIE'S
EXTERNAL SACK OF ORGANS,

06:22.367 --> 06:25.100
AND WE PUSHED IN AS MUCH
OF THE BOWEL AS WE COULD,

06:25.133 --> 06:27.067
AND WE THINK
WE CAN PUSH IN THE REST

06:27.067 --> 06:28.800
WITH A SECOND OPERATION.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.567
SHE HAS TO HAVE
A SECOND OPERATION?

06:30.600 --> 06:31.533
YEAH.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.533
OH, WELL,
NOT FOR A FEW DAYS.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.067
(Addison) DR. O'MALLEY?

06:35.100 --> 06:36.833
WE PUT IN LUCY'S BRAIN SHUNT
YESTERDAY,

06:36.867 --> 06:38.367
AND SHE'S DOING VERY WELL.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.267
WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP
MONITORING HER

06:40.300 --> 06:43.300
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPINAL
FLUID DOESN'T BACK UP.
STEVENS?

06:43.333 --> 06:45.433
DR. BURKE USED A CATHETER
TO OPEN EMILY'S ATRIAL SEPTUM

06:45.467 --> 06:46.433
LAST NIGHT.

06:46.467 --> 06:48.533
TODAY WE'RE GONNA GO IN
AND TRY TO RECONSTRUCT

06:48.567 --> 06:50.467
THE LEFT CHAMBER OF HER HEART.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.667
WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL.
DR. GREY?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.600
CHARLOTTE'S LUNGS WERE
A LITTLE MORE UNDERDEVELOPED

06:54.633 --> 06:56.567
THAN THE REST OF THE QUINTS.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.833
SO WE PUT
A SPECIAL MASK ON HER

06:58.867 --> 07:00.767
TO HELP HER BREATHE, AND WE'RE
MONITORING HER CLOSELY.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.433
AND THAT JUST LEAVES KATE.

07:02.467 --> 07:03.667
SHE SEEMS TO BE
PRETTY HEALTHY.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.467
NO MAJOR ISSUES
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.133
BUT WE'RE GONNA KEEP HER
IN THE ISOLETTE

07:07.167 --> 07:09.067
UNTIL SHE MAKES IT TO 4 POUNDS.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.833
YOU HEAR THAT, HONEY?
KATE'S DOING REALLY WELL.

07:10.867 --> 07:13.067
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.067
DR. SHEPHERD...

07:17.067 --> 07:20.067
TOM, SHE'S JUST HAD
FIVE BABIES.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.800
HER HORMONES
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.600
YOU'VE JUST GOT
TO GIVE HER SOME TIME.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.300
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

07:26.567 --> 07:28.433
GREY, KEEP AN EYE ON
THE MOTHER OF THE QUINTS.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.333
MAKE SURE HER HORMONES
DON'T GET THE BEST OF HER.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.067
I CAN LOOK OUT FOR DORIE.

07:32.067 --> 07:33.800
NO, YOU HAVE EMILY'S
HEART SURGERY WITH DR. BURKE.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.733
BUT I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE MOTHER.

07:35.767 --> 07:37.733
WHY ARE YOU ARGUING
WITH ME?
BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND

07:37.767 --> 07:38.833
WHY I'M BEING PUSHED
OFF OF A CASE--

07:38.867 --> 07:40.767
HEY, STEVENS, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SO ANGRY ABOUT,

07:40.800 --> 07:43.500
BUT I DON'T CARE, AND YOU
BETTER KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.533
ON TOP OF EVERY OTHER PATIENT
WE HAVE UNDER OUR CARE,

07:45.567 --> 07:47.367
WE HAVE QUINTS TO WORRY ABOUT,
UNDERSTOOD?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.300
LOOK, THESE ARE PREEMIES,
PEOPLE.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.233
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE SPENT
ANOTHER EIGHT WEEKS IN THE WOMB.

07:51.267 --> 07:53.133
JUST LIKE INTERNS, THEY'RE NOT
READY FOR THE REAL WORLD.

07:53.167 --> 07:54.500
(pager beeps)

07:54.533 --> 07:57.833
OH, IT'S THE PIT.
YANG, COME WITH ME.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.067
CONSTANCE FERGUSON, 40,

08:00.100 --> 08:01.600
INMATE AT HENDERSON,

08:01.633 --> 08:02.733
SWALLOWED A RAZOR BLADE.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.267
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE?
AAH!

08:04.300 --> 08:06.567
ATTEMPTED FIELD TRIP.
WORKED, TOO.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.667
AAH! HA HA!

08:08.700 --> 08:10.333
(cackles)

08:10.367 --> 08:12.267
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"FIELD TRIP"?

08:12.300 --> 08:14.233
SHE WAS IN SOLITARY.
THIS IS HER WAY OUT.

08:14.267 --> 08:15.433
SO IS SHE CRAZY?

08:15.467 --> 08:17.367
ONLY IF YOU'D CALL
A MURDERER CRAZY.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.333
YEAH, BABY. THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. WHOO!

08:29.133 --> 08:32.067
MS. FERGUSON, ARE YOU
EXPERIENCING ANY DISCOMFORT?

08:32.067 --> 08:35.367
YOU MEAN APART FROM
THESE SNAZZY HANDCUFFS

08:35.400 --> 08:36.600
YOU'VE GOT PINCHING
MY WRISTS?

08:36.633 --> 08:40.067
DID YOU AT LEAST
PUT TAPE ON THE BLADE?
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.800
YOU SWALLOWED A RAZOR BLADE.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.767
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME
WHAT HURTS?
WHAT, AND SHORTEN
MY VACATION?

08:43.800 --> 08:45.767
HEY, SINCE YOU'RE JUST
STANDING AROUND,

08:45.800 --> 08:47.567
WHY DON'T YOU GET ME
SOME CHOCOLATE PUDDING?

08:47.600 --> 08:48.800
MAKE THE BLADE
GO DOWN SMOOTHER.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.667
YANG, GET AN X-RAY.
MAKE IT PORTABLE.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.333
WITH PRISONERS, WE HAVE TO
MINIMIZE FLIGHT RISK.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.067
OKAY, OKAY, BUT I'M
SUPPOSED TO CHECK ON JULIE.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.700
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP

08:57.733 --> 09:00.167
A CLOSE EYE ON THE QUINTS.
JULIE'S MY QUINT, TOO.
I GOT THAT COVERED. YOU DO THIS.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.200
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T DO IT?

09:02.233 --> 09:04.100
I CAN. I CHOOSE NOT TO.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.400
COME ON, BABY.

09:07.433 --> 09:08.600
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

09:08.633 --> 09:12.733
I ONLY MURDERED THREE PEOPLE,
AND NONE OF THEM WERE DOCTORS.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.433
OLIVIA.
DR. O'MALLEY.

09:16.467 --> 09:17.800
HOW ARE THE LEECHES DOING?

09:17.833 --> 09:21.633
THEY'RE NOT. I STILL CAN'T
GET THEM TO BITE.
WITH ALL THIS BLOOD,

09:21.667 --> 09:22.867
YOU'D THINK IT'D BE
A NO-BRAINER FOR A LEECH.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.800
(George) SOMETIMES THEY GET
A LITTLE ANXIOUS--BRIGHT LIGHTS,

09:24.833 --> 09:27.633
THUNDER STORMS, YOU KNOW--
OHH!

09:27.667 --> 09:30.567
NERVOUS HANDLERS.
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD BE
BETTER AT THIS.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.167
I STILL GET A LITTLE SQUEAMISH
AROUND LEECHES.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.467
OH, THAT IS NOT
WHAT I HAVE HEARD.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.433
DR. O'MALLEY
CAN TAKE OVER FROM HERE.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.667
WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

09:43.700 --> 09:45.667
NOTHING.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.267
THERE WE ARE.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.633
HE'S IN.

10:08.467 --> 10:11.333
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU
AND ALEX WERE A COUPLE.

10:11.367 --> 10:12.533
IT'S JUST...

10:12.567 --> 10:14.467
I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY,

10:14.500 --> 10:17.267
AND IT WAS GOOD
TO HAVE SOMEONE.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.167
(bell dings)

10:19.200 --> 10:22.067
GOOD TO TALK TO, I MEAN.
NOT GOOD TO...

10:22.100 --> 10:25.433
ALEX REALLY IS GOOD.

10:25.467 --> 10:28.700
I MEAN, HE'S GOOD IN THE WAY
HE'S A GOOD PERSON GOOD.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.633
NOT THE OTHER KIND OF GOOD.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.200
(bell dings)

10:32.233 --> 10:34.500
YOU KNOW, GOOD IN BED GOOD.

10:34.533 --> 10:37.700
WHICH, HE IS,
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW.

10:37.733 --> 10:39.467
(bell dings)

10:39.500 --> 10:42.133
BUT... OKAY, WELL...

10:42.167 --> 10:44.067
BYE.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.667
ANY TEMPERATURE SPIKES?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.833
NO, NO FEVER.
VITALS ARE STABLE.

10:55.867 --> 10:57.400
GOOD. THAT'S VERY GOOD.

10:57.433 --> 11:00.400
GO AHEAD. AFTER YOU.
THANK YOU.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.200
SO YOU'RE GIVING UP
THE TRAILER?

11:05.233 --> 11:06.400
I'M NOT GIVING UP
THE TRAILER.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.133
IS ADDISON TELLING PEOPLE
THAT I'M GIVING UP THE TRAILER?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.733
IT'S JUST FUNNY.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.800
I JUST WOULD NEVER HAVE
PEGGED YOU FOR THAT GUY.

11:12.833 --> 11:15.600
WHAT GUY?
YOU KNOW,

11:15.633 --> 11:17.500
THE MARBLE BATH, PRIVATE POOL,
GATED-COMMUNITY GUY.

11:17.533 --> 11:19.467
DON'T PEG ME.
I'M NOT PEGGABLE.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.733
YOU'RE PEGGED.
DEAL WITH IT.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.633
(monitor beeping rapidly)

11:23.667 --> 11:26.300
B.P.'s LOW.
SHE'S TACHYCARDIC.
(Derek) SATS?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.133
DROPPING ON HIGH-FLOW 02.

11:28.167 --> 11:30.200
(beeping continues)

11:30.233 --> 11:33.067
NO BREATHING SOUNDS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.733
HER LUNG HAS COLLAPSED.
SHOULD I CALL
THE OTHER DR. SHEPHERD?

11:35.767 --> 11:37.700
THERE'S NO TIME.
HERE, STICK THIS BETWEEN

11:37.733 --> 11:39.600
HER SECOND AND THIRD RIB.
DO NOT GO TOO DEEP.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.733
YOU'RE GONNA HEAR
A SMALL GUSH OF AIR.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.333
(beeping continues)

11:50.233 --> 11:51.433
I HEARD IT.

11:51.467 --> 11:54.733
(monitor beeping stabilizes)

11:54.767 --> 11:56.100
NICE JOB.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.733
THANK YOU.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.600
I'M NOT GIVING UP
THE TRAILER.

11:59.633 --> 12:02.633
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
DR. SHEPHERD.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.467
HER LUNG COLLAPSED?
AND I KNOW
IT SOUNDS SCARY,

12:07.500 --> 12:10.333
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT THAT
UNCOMMON IN A PREEMIE THIS SIZE.

12:10.367 --> 12:13.267
SO WE'VE INSERTED A TUBE
INTO CHARLOTTE'S CHEST,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.200
AND THAT
WILL HELP HER BREATHE

12:15.233 --> 12:17.833
UNTIL HER LUNG CAN STAY UP
ON ITS OWN.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.333
MRS. RUSSELL?

12:19.367 --> 12:20.667
(cell phone rings)

12:20.700 --> 12:24.267
SHE REALLY IS
DOING FINE NOW.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.133
THAT'S ME.
I GOTTA GO.

12:26.167 --> 12:28.833
MY MOM CAN ONLY HANDLE
THE TRIPLETS FOR HALF A DAY.

12:28.867 --> 12:31.667
SHE'S 74, SO...

12:33.533 --> 12:36.133
I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON
AS I GET HOME, OKAY?

12:36.167 --> 12:37.100
MM-HMM.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.367
I LOVE YOU.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.100
COULD YOU, UH...

12:46.133 --> 12:47.767
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
THANK YOU.
OKAY.

12:52.667 --> 12:55.267
DORIE.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.100
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

12:58.133 --> 13:01.067
YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF
FOR THIS.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.133
I'VE GOT ONE BABY
WHO CAN BARELY BREATHE

13:03.167 --> 13:05.700
AND ONE WITH HALF A HEART.

13:07.233 --> 13:09.667
TWO OF THE OTHERS ARE...

13:12.533 --> 13:14.600
(sighs) IF I'D HAVE LISTENED
TO THE DOCTORS,

13:14.633 --> 13:16.533
I COULD'VE HAD
THREE HEALTHY GIRLS

13:16.567 --> 13:19.333
INSTEAD OF FIVE WHO MIGHT NOT
LIVE UNTIL TOMORROW.

13:19.367 --> 13:22.233
IT WAS MY DECISION.

13:22.267 --> 13:24.167
TOM AGREED WITH THE DOCTORS.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.700
SO REALLY, DR. GREY...

13:28.733 --> 13:32.200
WHO ELSE SHOULD I BLAME?

13:32.233 --> 13:34.200
FIRST STEP IN THE NORWOOD
IS THE CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS.

13:34.233 --> 13:37.100
WITH H.L.H.S.,
WHAT ELSE DO YOU GET

13:37.133 --> 13:39.433
BESIDES HYPERPLASIA
OF THE VENTRICLE?

13:39.467 --> 13:41.533
STENOSIS OR ATRESIA OF
THE MITRAL AND AORTIC VALVES.

13:41.567 --> 13:44.233
WHY ARE WE USING
THE RV-PA CONDUIT

13:44.267 --> 13:46.500
INSTEAD OF THE MODIFIED
BLALOCK-TAUSSIG SHUNT?

13:46.533 --> 13:48.067
IT LIMITS DIASTOLIC RUNOFF.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.333
WELL, YOU'VE DONE
YOUR HOMEWORK.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.700
I WAS ON CALL LAST NIGHT.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.633
I STUDY WHEN I'M ON CALL.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.067
(chuckles) WELL, NO MATTER
WHAT THE BOOKS SAY,

13:58.100 --> 14:00.333
I GUARANTEE YOU

14:00.367 --> 14:03.333
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
A HEART THIS SMALL.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.367
BETCHA I HAVE.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.433
(Miranda)
HOW YOU DOING, YOU?

14:10.467 --> 14:12.767
YOU KNOW,
I'M HAVING A BABY, TOO.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.667
(baby-talk voice)
YES, I AM. A LITTLE BOY.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.700
MAYBE YOU
CAN MEET HIM SOMEDAY.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.633
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

14:19.667 --> 14:20.833
WE COULD--

14:20.867 --> 14:22.533
(clears throat)

14:26.733 --> 14:28.633
(normal voice) PREGNANCY
HAS NOT MADE ME SOFT.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.133
I HAVEN'T GONE SOFT.
I DON'T DO SOFT.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.333
OF COURSE NOT.

14:33.367 --> 14:35.167
YOU WERE JUST TALKING
TO A PATIENT.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.700
WHAT'S THIS?

14:36.733 --> 14:38.400
THE INMATE'S X-RAYS.

14:38.433 --> 14:39.567
UH...

14:39.600 --> 14:40.767
THAT FOOLISH, FOOLISH WOMAN.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.100
SHE SWALLOWED
FOUR RAZOR BLADES?

14:45.133 --> 14:46.500
MM-HMM.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.267
HEY! HEY YOU!

14:53.300 --> 14:54.467
HEY, NURSE!

14:54.500 --> 14:57.100
WOULD YOU KEEP IT DOWN,
PLEASE?

14:57.133 --> 14:58.767
I'M STARVING.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.333
YOU'RE N.P.O.
NO FOOD ALLOWED.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.067
COME ON, APRIL, BABY,
DON'T GO FOR HIM.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.700
HE'S SUCH AN IDIOT.

15:05.733 --> 15:07.833
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO STARVE TO DEATH.

15:07.867 --> 15:10.233
I WANT MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP
ICE CREAM.

15:10.267 --> 15:11.500
MINT, OKAY?
NOT ROCKY ROAD.

15:11.533 --> 15:14.567
YOU BETTER NOT GET ME
THAT ROCKY ROAD. IT SUCKS.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.600
OH, THANK GOD.

15:16.633 --> 15:17.833
MAMA BEAR, HELP ME OUT HERE,
OKAY? I'M STARVING.

15:17.867 --> 15:19.200
DON'T GIVE HER ANYTHING.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.267
SEE, RIGHT THERE
YOU'RE IN OFFICIAL VIOLATION

15:21.300 --> 15:22.667
OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.067
YOU CAN'T EAT ANYTHING

15:24.100 --> 15:25.833
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO UNDERGO MAJOR SURGERY.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.533
WHAT?
WHAT'S SHE TALKIN' ABOUT?

15:27.567 --> 15:29.233
YOU'RE AT RISK FOR
A PERFORATED INTESTINE

15:29.267 --> 15:31.200
AND HALF A DOZEN KINDS
OF INFECTION.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.133
WE NEED TO OPERATE
RIGHT AWAY.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.333
I DON'T NEED AN OPERATION.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.300
I TAPED UP THE BLADE
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.067
IT PASSES THE NEXT DAY.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

15:38.100 --> 15:41.200
YOU SWALLOWED FOUR BLADES
THIS TIME. THAT'S THE BIG DEAL.

15:41.233 --> 15:45.100
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BUY ME
AN EXTRA DAY.

15:45.133 --> 15:48.067
DOES THIS OPERATION HAVE
A NICE, LONG RECOVERY TIME?

15:48.067 --> 15:50.100
(Cristina) YOU REALIZE
THIS IS MAJOR SURGERY?

15:50.133 --> 15:52.067
IT'S DANGEROUS
AND YOU COULD DIE.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.400
MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.233
I WANT AT LEAST A GALLON

16:00.267 --> 16:03.067
AFTER YOU GHOULS ARE DONE
SPLITTING ME OPEN.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.700
(Dorie) WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT WE'RE DOING?

16:08.733 --> 16:10.067
WE'RE VISITING.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.333
WE'VE THROWN ALL THIS
MEDICAL TALK AT YOU

16:12.367 --> 16:14.467
AND OUTLINED ALL THESE
WORST-CASE SCENARIOS,

16:14.500 --> 16:16.600
WHICH HAS PROBABLY
SCARED YOU HALF TO DEATH.

16:16.633 --> 16:19.467
THE ONE THING WE HAVEN'T DONE
IS ACTUALLY GIVEN YOU

16:19.500 --> 16:22.200
A CHANCE TO BE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTERS.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.133
WELL, HOW IS THAT
GONNA HELP?

16:24.167 --> 16:26.067
IF I LEARNED ANYTHING
IN THESE PAST FEW DAYS,

16:26.100 --> 16:28.567
IT'S THAT I NEED
TO FACE REALITY.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.767
HERE'S KATE.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.200
YOU CAN REACH IN
AND TOUCH HER IF YOU LIKE.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.700
I WOULD LIKE TO
VERY MUCH.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.267
(monitor beeping rapidly)

16:42.300 --> 16:45.067
(Nurse) DR. GREY,
CHARLOTTE'S NOT BREATHING.

16:45.067 --> 16:47.833
(beeping continues)

16:47.867 --> 16:49.333
(Meredith)
PAGE ADDISON SHEPHERD.

16:49.367 --> 16:50.833
SHE'S IN THE O.R.

16:50.867 --> 16:52.767
(Addison) WE DIDN'T
SEE THIS ON THE ECHO.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.567
YOU CAN NEVER GET
AN EXACT MEASUREMENT.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.733
WHAT?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.433
THE BABY'S AORTA
IS NARROWER THAN WE THOUGHT.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.533
THE DIAMETER
IS ONLY A MILLIMETER.

17:02.567 --> 17:04.467
JUST NOT GETTING
ENOUGH BLOOD FLOW.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.267
DAMN.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.133
I WANTED YOU TO SEE THIS
BEFORE I STARTED CLOSING UP.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.167
YOU'RE CLOSING UP?
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.200
DR. STEVENS.
NO, WE BARELY STARTED.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.600
DR. BURKE HAS DONE AS MUCH
AS HE CAN DO FOR NOW,

17:18.633 --> 17:20.633
SO UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO DO
A FIRST STAGE NORWOOD,

17:20.667 --> 17:22.767
HE'S GONNA CLOSE
THIS BABY'S CHEST.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.300
(pager beeps)

17:28.367 --> 17:30.100
YOU OKAY?

17:30.133 --> 17:33.767
I'M FINE. MAY I GO?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.167
YES.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.533
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:39.567 --> 17:40.733
SHE HAD AN APNEIC EPISODE.

17:40.767 --> 17:44.333
SHE'S STILL NOT BREATHING
ON HER OWN.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.233
(Addison) LET'S INTUBATE
AND GIVE HER SURFACTANT.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.400
PUSH .1 ATROPINE
AND 3 MILLIGRAMS OF KETAMINE.

17:50.433 --> 17:51.333
MEDS ARE IN.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.100
TUBE.

17:56.833 --> 17:58.633
OKAY.
PLACE THE C02 DETECTOR.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.567
SHE WAS DOING FINE
WITH THE CHEST TUBE.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.633
THAT'S THE THING
WITH R.D.S. CASES.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.400
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
THE BABY'S GETTING BETTER,

18:05.433 --> 18:06.600
THEY CAN SLIP RIGHT BACK.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.367
BREATH SOUNDS EQUAL.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.333
GOOD.

18:11.367 --> 18:14.100
MRS. RUSSELL.

18:19.233 --> 18:21.067
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.833
WHO WOULD DO THIS
TO THEMSELVES?

18:22.867 --> 18:25.633
THE WOMAN WASN'T JUST
IN PRISON, YANG,

18:25.667 --> 18:27.433
SHE WAS IN SOLITARY.

18:27.467 --> 18:30.433
WELL, SHE WAS
SERIOUSLY DERANGED.

18:30.467 --> 18:33.467
YOU TRY SPENDING A MONTH
LOCKED IN A ROOM

18:33.500 --> 18:35.433
WITH NO WINDOWS,

18:35.467 --> 18:38.633
NO ONE TO TALK TO
23 HOURS A DAY,

18:38.667 --> 18:40.367
SEE HOW DERANGED
SHE IS THEN.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.067
DR. BAILEY,
SHE'S A MURDERER.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.200
I DIDN'T SAY SHE WASN'T.

18:43.233 --> 18:45.600
ONE, TWO, THREE...

18:45.633 --> 18:47.700
I SAID TRY HAVING NO ONE

18:47.733 --> 18:49.633
TO MAKE
YOUR SNARKY COMMENTS TO

18:49.667 --> 18:51.567
FOR A SOLID MONTH.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.567
MY GUESS IS YOU'D SWALLOW
THE ENTIRE RAZOR.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.267
HOW ARE THEY TREATING YOU,
MR. MURPHY?

18:58.300 --> 19:00.200
OH, I'VE DONE WORSE
FOR COMPANY.

19:00.233 --> 19:02.133
OH, THEY'RE DEFINITELY
FILLING UP.

19:02.167 --> 19:04.067
THE TISSUE IS GETTING
NICE AND PINK.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.833
YOU MAKE UP WITH THAT
CUTE LITTLE GIRLFRIEND

19:05.867 --> 19:07.367
OF YOURS YET?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.600
OLIVIA'S HARDLY
MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:12.567 --> 19:14.067
IS SHE OKAY?
SHE?

19:14.067 --> 19:15.600
YEAH. ISABELLA.

19:15.633 --> 19:19.433
AND THIS ONE HERE
ON MY FINGER...

19:19.467 --> 19:20.567
THAT'S DARCY.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.067
AND THAT LITTLE GUY
ON MY NOSE--

19:23.100 --> 19:24.167
NAMED O'MALLEY.

19:24.200 --> 19:24.967
(laughs)

19:25.067 --> 19:27.067
THAT'S RIGHT.
I NAMED HIM AFTER YOU.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.833
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT GOT HIM TO BITE.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.300
ISABELLA'S FINE.
SHE'S JUST FULL.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.833
OH. OH.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.767
W-WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH HER?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.133
SHE'S DONE HER JOB.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.467
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANY MORE USE FOR HER

19:38.500 --> 19:39.700
EXCEPT AS MEDICAL WASTE.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.500
NO. I'D LIKE TO KEEP HER,

19:41.533 --> 19:43.400
IF I COULD.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.267
***

19:45.300 --> 19:46.500
CRAZY NATURE MAN.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.433
YOU WANNA TAKE A LEECH HOME
AS A PET?

19:48.467 --> 19:49.800
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.733
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY

19:51.767 --> 19:53.267
IN FRONT OF A PATIENT.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.800
YEAH? WELL,
YOU HURT MY FRIEND.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.600
I HAD NO IDEA
ALEX WAS SEEING IZZIE.

19:56.633 --> 19:58.567
THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.500
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHY I'M UPSET.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.433
BESIDES, YOU KNOW
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

20:02.467 --> 20:04.733
IS, UH, WHY ALEX,
AND WHY AGAIN?

20:04.767 --> 20:09.133
PEOPLE GET LONELY, GEORGE.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.067
***

20:11.100 --> 20:14.800
(Meredith) HI, MR. RUSSELL.
IT'S MEREDITH GREY CALLING.

20:14.833 --> 20:17.067
I WAS WONDERING
IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE

20:17.100 --> 20:19.767
MAYBE YOU COULD BRING YOUR BOYS
BY TO VISIT THEIR MOM.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.367
I THINK SHE COULD USE
THE COMPANY.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.100
OH, THE FLU.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.467
NO, DEFINITELY DON'T BRING THEM.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.700
THANK YOU. YOU TOO.

20:30.300 --> 20:34.267
***

20:34.300 --> 20:36.200
YOU'VE BEEN LYING LOW.

20:36.233 --> 20:37.433
WELL, NOBODY'S TALKING TO ME

20:37.467 --> 20:39.700
SO IT MAKES IT
KIND OF EASY, RIGHT?

20:41.700 --> 20:43.833
I'M TALKING TO YOU...

20:43.867 --> 20:45.767
IN SHORT,
MONOSYLLABIC SENTENCES

20:45.800 --> 20:48.300
LACED WITH DISDAIN
AND CONTEMPT.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.233
SO, WHAT,
ACCORDING TO GIRL RULES,

20:50.267 --> 20:52.367
NOW YOU ALL HAVE TO HATE ME?
I DON'T HATE YOU.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.100
IF MY MOTHER
HADN'T GOTTEN ALZHEIMER'S,

20:54.133 --> 20:56.167
I'D PROBABLY BE YOU.
OH, REALLY?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.400
REALLY.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.367
BEFORE SHE GOT SICK,
I MEAN, I...

20:59.400 --> 21:01.067
I MEAN, I FINISHED COLLEGE,

21:01.100 --> 21:03.333
BUT I WAS PARTYING
WAY TOO MUCH,

21:03.367 --> 21:06.100
STAYING OUT WAY TOO LATE
TO KEEP A JOB.

21:06.133 --> 21:08.067
I WAS THE ONE
AT FAMILY REUNIONS

21:08.067 --> 21:09.800
EVERYBODY WAS EMBARRASSED
TO TALK ABOUT.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.467
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK
OF ME?

21:12.500 --> 21:14.633
ARE YOU OKAY?

21:14.667 --> 21:16.667
I ALMOST KILLED A GUY
YESTERDAY.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.200
MR. MARTIN.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.533
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND
ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP HIM.

21:20.567 --> 21:23.267
OKAY, WELL,
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

21:23.300 --> 21:26.700
UH, ANYTHING ON
CENTRAL PONTINE MYELINOLYSIS.

21:26.733 --> 21:30.733
***

21:34.367 --> 21:35.767
UNBELIEVABLE.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.200
IZZIE.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.400
IZZIE, COME ON.

21:42.433 --> 21:43.233
COME ON? COME ON?

21:43.267 --> 21:44.667
YOU'RE FRATERNIZING
WITH THE ENEMY,

21:44.700 --> 21:47.067
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO COME ON.
ALEX AND I
ARE SORT OF FRIENDS.

21:47.067 --> 21:48.800
SINCE WHEN? SINCE WHEN
ARE YOU AND ALEX FRIENDS?

21:48.833 --> 21:52.200
YOU TELL ME TO CUT MY LOSSES,
THAT I'M BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM,

21:52.233 --> 21:54.133
AND AS SOON AS I TURN
MY BACK...

21:54.167 --> 21:57.267
IZZIE, YOU'RE MAKING WAY
TOO BIG A DEAL OUTTA THIS.

21:57.300 --> 21:58.733
RIGHT, OF COURSE, BECAUSE
I'M THE UNREASONABLE ONE.

21:58.767 --> 21:59.800
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEREDITH?
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.067
SLEEP WITH THE GUY
FOR ALL I CARE.

22:01.067 --> 22:03.333
WELL, OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT
GOING TO SLEEP WITH HIM, IZZIE.

22:03.367 --> 22:05.267
WHY NOT? YOU'VE SLEPT
WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

22:05.300 --> 22:09.200
***

22:17.200 --> 22:18.767
(Cristina)
YOUR SURGERY WENT SMOOTHLY.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.700
YOU'LL HAVE SOME ABDOMINAL PAIN
FOR A DAY OR TWO--

22:20.733 --> 22:21.833
JUST A DAY OR TWO?

22:21.867 --> 22:24.067
WE'LL WATCH YOU UNTIL
YOUR BOWELS START MOVING AGAIN.

22:24.067 --> 22:25.800
THE AVERAGE
IS ABOUT 36 HOURS.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.833
36? 4 RAZOR BLADES,
AND THAT'S ALL YOU CAN GIVE ME?

22:28.867 --> 22:30.533
COME ON, SUGAR PLUM.

22:30.567 --> 22:31.700
I THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING FUN.

22:31.733 --> 22:33.100
DON'T LEAVE.

22:33.133 --> 22:34.400
WHAT?

22:34.433 --> 22:36.333
JUST MAYBE
A LITTLE CONVERSATION.

22:36.367 --> 22:38.267
I MEAN, THEY GOT ME
IN HERE ALL BY MYSELF.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.200
I THOUGHT I'D HAVE
A ROOMMATE,

22:40.233 --> 22:41.667
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

22:41.700 --> 22:44.167
OKAY.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.100
WHY'D YOU KILL THREE PEOPLE?

22:46.133 --> 22:50.267
START OFF A LITTLE SMALL TALK,
WHY DON'T YOU?

22:50.300 --> 22:52.500
I WAS HIGH...

22:52.533 --> 22:55.400
ON METH.

22:58.833 --> 23:02.633
AND I HAD THIS BOYFRIEND WHO...

23:02.667 --> 23:04.833
HAD THIS ROBBERY
ALL PLANNED OUT.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.767
HE SAID
THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME

23:06.800 --> 23:08.700
IF I DIDN'T HELP HIM.

23:08.733 --> 23:12.467
THINGS GOT OUT OF CONTROL.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.400
(sighs)

23:14.433 --> 23:16.700
HE WAS GONNA LEAVE ME.

23:16.733 --> 23:19.600
HE--HE WAS ALL I HAD.

23:19.633 --> 23:23.067
I WOULD'VE BEEN ALL ALONE.

23:23.067 --> 23:26.300
CLEARLY, BEING ALONE
HAS ITS BENEFITS.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.300
YOU PAGED ME?

23:38.333 --> 23:39.667
ANOTHER LEECH FELL OFF,

23:39.700 --> 23:41.600
AND I CAN'T GET
THE NEW ONE TO BITE.

23:41.633 --> 23:42.533
I'M SORRY.
THEY JUST REALLY FREAK ME OUT.

23:42.567 --> 23:44.067
I'M A SURGEON, OLIVIA.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.167
YOU'RE AN INTERN, GEORGE.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.667
YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

23:48.700 --> 23:51.167
TIME FOR YOU TWO KIDS
TO KISS AND MAKE UP,

23:51.200 --> 23:52.533
THAT'S WHAT TIME IT IS.

23:52.567 --> 23:54.467
MR. MURPHY,
WE ARE NOT A COUPLE.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.300
OH, YOU CAN'T PULL MUCH
OVER ON ME.

23:57.333 --> 24:00.200
NOW I SAY THERE'S SOMETHING
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.267
YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. MURPHY.
THERE WAS.

24:02.300 --> 24:03.767
OLIVIA, THIS ISN'T THE TIME.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.700
AND THIS...
REALLY ISN'T THE PLACE.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.633
HE BROKE UP WITH ME
FOR THIS GIRL

24:07.667 --> 24:09.067
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT HE'S ALIVE.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.067
SHE DOES SO KNOW
I'M ALIVE.
LISTEN TO ME, GEORGE.

24:11.067 --> 24:12.600
YOU, MEREDITH GREY--
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

24:12.633 --> 24:15.433
WHAT? WHY--WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
THINK IT'S MEREDITH?

24:15.467 --> 24:17.433
ANYONE WHO'S PAYING
THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF ATTENTION

24:17.467 --> 24:18.433
KNOWS HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT MEREDITH, EXCEPT MEREDITH,

24:18.467 --> 24:21.467
WHICH SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING,
SHOULDN'T IT?

24:21.500 --> 24:23.500
SORRY, MR. MURPHY.

24:25.233 --> 24:27.733
SHE GAVE ME SYPHILIS.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.633
REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID TO ME
WHEN I WAS AN INTERN?

24:30.667 --> 24:32.667
HOW COULD I FORGET?

24:32.700 --> 24:35.400
YOU DIDN'T SPEAK TO ME
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.600
BUT YOU LEARNED.

24:36.633 --> 24:38.300
YEAH, WELL, I THINK

24:38.333 --> 24:40.233
I GOTTA DO THAT
TO IZZIE STEVENS.

24:40.267 --> 24:43.067
WELL, SHE'S SMART,
HARDWORKING.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.733
GETS A LITTLE TOO INVOLVED
WITH HER PATIENTS.

24:45.767 --> 24:47.267
A LOT LIKE YOU.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.333
I KNOW.

24:48.367 --> 24:51.200
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO RECOVER FROM THAT, RICHARD.

24:51.233 --> 24:53.533
BUT IT MADE YOU
A BETTER SURGEON, ADDISON.

24:53.567 --> 24:55.067
THE QUESTION IS,

24:55.100 --> 24:57.400
IS SHE TALENTED ENOUGH
TO MAKE THE LESSON WORTH IT?

24:57.433 --> 25:00.400
SHE'S THE BEST I'VE SEEN
IN YEARS.

25:00.433 --> 25:02.333
I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD--

25:02.367 --> 25:03.533
YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO MAKE FRIENDS, ADDISON.

25:03.567 --> 25:06.167
YOU'RE HERE TO MAKE
BETTER SURGEONS,

25:06.200 --> 25:09.733
AND BEING A TEACHER
CAN BE A LONELY BUSINESS.

25:12.567 --> 25:15.167
I'M TELLING YOU,
MEREDITH WAS ALL OVER HIM.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.100
SERIOUSLY?
SHE WAS ALL OVER HIM?

25:17.133 --> 25:19.667
WHAT, LIKE, UH, MOUNTING HIM
WITH ALL THE BABIES WATCHING?

25:19.700 --> 25:22.333
SERIOUSLY?
WELL, SHE WOULD'VE BEEN
IF I HADN'T INTERRUPTED.

25:22.367 --> 25:23.467
SHE WAS TALKING TO HIM.
YOU DON'T TALK TO BASTARDS

25:23.500 --> 25:26.200
WHO CHEAT ON THEIR GIRLFRIENDS,
GEORGE. THAT'S THE RULE.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.567
YOU WEREN'T OFFICIALLY
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.500
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
IT IS KIND OF THE POINT.

25:29.533 --> 25:31.067
YOU DON'T SEE ME GETTING

25:31.067 --> 25:33.100
ALL EMOTIONAL OVER PEOPLE
I'M NOT DATING.

25:33.133 --> 25:35.200
REALLY? YOU WANNA GO THERE?

25:35.233 --> 25:36.167
NO.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.200
I'M HAVING A MOMENT HERE.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.100
DON'T MESS WITH ME.

25:40.133 --> 25:41.833
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN

25:41.867 --> 25:45.300
OR KILL YOURSELF,
ARE YOU?
NO.

25:45.333 --> 25:48.367
SO THERE'S NO CHANCE
YOU'LL KILL US?

25:51.567 --> 25:53.467
OH, THAT WAS WRONG
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.133
SO GOOD.

25:55.167 --> 25:56.733
THAT WAS--
THAT WAS GOOD.

25:56.767 --> 25:58.267
YEAH, IT WAS GOOD.

25:58.300 --> 26:02.167
YOUR LUNGS ARE NOT GOOD.

26:04.667 --> 26:07.533
I KNOW WE GOT YOU OUT OF THERE
A LITTLE EARLIER

26:07.567 --> 26:08.733
THAN YOU WOULD'VE WANTED.

26:08.767 --> 26:12.467
WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
TO HELP YOU.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.333
SO IF YOU HAVE
ANY IDEAS, CHARLOTTE...

26:25.100 --> 26:26.600
(Addison) DR. STEVENS.

26:26.633 --> 26:29.633
DR. SHEPHERD,
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU NEED?

26:29.667 --> 26:31.567
YES, DR. BURKE AND I
HAVE REASSESSED.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.500
WE THINK THERE'S A CHANCE
WITH THE NORWOOD

26:33.533 --> 26:35.433
IF EMILY CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NEXT TEN HOURS.

26:35.467 --> 26:37.367
WOULD YOU LOOK AFTER HER
FOR THE NIGHT?

26:37.400 --> 26:39.433
I WAS ON CALL LAST NIGHT.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.733
BUT, I MEAN, YEAH,
OF COURSE.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.667
GOOD.
I'VE LEFT A LIST OF MEDS,

26:43.700 --> 26:45.700
AND YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
PEDIATRIC LIFE SUPPORT?

26:45.733 --> 26:48.367
GOT MYSELF CERTIFIED AS SOON
AS I GOT IN THE PROGRAM.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.733
OKAY THEN.

26:49.767 --> 26:51.833
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW TO LOOK OUT FOR?

26:51.867 --> 26:53.533
NO. THAT SHOULD DO IT.

26:53.567 --> 26:55.467
SHOULD I NOTIFY MRS. RUSSELL
ABOUT EMILY'S--

26:55.500 --> 26:56.633
NO. I'VE DONE THAT.

26:56.667 --> 26:59.433
DR. STEVENS, THIS BABY
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

26:59.467 --> 27:02.500
SHE BETTER BE ALIVE
WHEN I GET BACK IN THE MORNING.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.333
OKAY.

27:07.533 --> 27:09.433
DR. SHEPHERD,
I FOUND THESE STUDIES

27:09.467 --> 27:10.800
WHERE THEY USED
AGGRESSIVE PLASMAPHERESIS.

27:10.833 --> 27:12.733
I THINK THESE COULD WORK
ON MR. MARTIN.

27:12.767 --> 27:14.067
THOSE ARE ALL ISOLATED CASES.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.333
BUT STILL, THE STUDIES RESULTED
IN IMPROVED CLINICAL SYMPTOMS.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.733
NO TRIAL STUDY'S EVER BEEN DONE.
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

27:18.767 --> 27:21.400
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THYROTROPIN
RELEASING HORMONE?
NO, NO.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.733
THERE'S EUROPEAN STUDIES--
KAREV, IT'S OVER. IT'S DONE.
YOU SCREWED UP.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.767
MR. MARTIN'S FRIED.
YOU FRIED HIS BRAIN.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.233
IF HE WAKES UP,
YOU PUT HIM IN A WHEELCHAIR.

27:28.267 --> 27:30.167
IF HE DIES,
YOU KILLED HIM.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.100
DEAL WITH IT.

27:32.133 --> 27:35.700
***

27:38.767 --> 27:42.567
DR. STEVENS, BABY'S V02 IS STILL
40% AFTER TRANSFUSION.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.333
HOW'S HER B.P. DOING?

27:44.367 --> 27:47.100
STILL LOW.
LAST SYSTOLIC WAS 52.

27:47.133 --> 27:50.200
OKAY, I'M GONNA PUSH 30 cc's
OF N.S. MANUALLY.

27:52.267 --> 27:53.600
(monitor beeping)

27:53.633 --> 27:56.200
NICE START.
PRESSURE'S 65.

27:56.233 --> 27:58.767
***

28:04.300 --> 28:05.633
HEY, IZZ.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.400
OKAY, REALLY?
YOU THINK I'M TALKING TO YOU?

28:08.433 --> 28:11.433
WELL, I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I'M SORRY.

28:11.467 --> 28:13.633
WHAT ARE YOU SORRY FOR?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.500
WHEN DEREK BROKE UP WITH YOU,

28:17.533 --> 28:20.400
I NEVER ONCE SAID,
"YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM."

28:20.433 --> 28:22.100
IT'S NOT SUPPORTIVE.
IT'S CONDESCENDING.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.667
I WAS THERE.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.600
ALL I EVER AM
IS THERE FOR YOU GUYS,

28:25.633 --> 28:27.633
AND THE ONE TIME
I NEED YOU...

28:27.667 --> 28:31.433
JUST... GO AWAY, MEREDITH.

28:31.467 --> 28:34.333
***

28:37.100 --> 28:40.267
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
SHE WAS FINE.
SHE JUST STARTED SEIZING.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.067
(gagging)

28:43.800 --> 28:46.267
SHE'S NOT SEIZING,
SHE'S CHOKING.

28:47.367 --> 28:50.200
***

28:58.800 --> 29:00.733
SHE SWALLOWED A LIGHTBULB.

29:00.767 --> 29:02.600
***

29:09.633 --> 29:11.267
WE'RE LOSING HER.

29:11.300 --> 29:14.233
I CAN SEE THAT.
DON'T YOU THINK I CAN SEE THAT?

29:19.167 --> 29:21.067
SHE NEEDS AN AIRWAY.

29:26.567 --> 29:28.533
OH, SHE'S CLAMPED DOWN.
I CAN'T INTUBATE.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.467
WE NEED SOME HELP IN HERE.
YOU WANT ME TO GET PARALYTICS
TO RELAX THE MUSCLES?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.400
UH, NO.
SHE'LL BE DEAD BY THEN.

29:32.433 --> 29:34.800
I-I NEED A SCALPEL
FOR A CRICH.

29:34.833 --> 29:37.700
HAVE YOU DONE ONE?
OF COURSE NOT. GO.

29:39.233 --> 29:41.067
I WAS GONNA DO A CRICH.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.833
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN
UNCONSCIOUS?

29:42.867 --> 29:44.367
SHE JUST WENT DOWN.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.300
PREP O.R. 2.
EMERGENCY THORACOTOMY.

29:46.333 --> 29:49.667
CRISTINA, IT'LL BE OKAY.
COME ON. COME ON. COME ON.

29:51.567 --> 29:53.200
SHE'S CODING.

29:53.233 --> 29:54.067
AGAIN?

29:54.067 --> 29:56.233
OKAY, UH,
TURN UP THE EPI DRIP.

29:56.267 --> 29:58.767
(monitor beeps)

29:58.800 --> 30:01.067
OKAY.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.433
OKAY.

30:10.467 --> 30:12.667
OKAY.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.200
HI, DORIE.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:19.433 --> 30:21.100
I'M PACKING.

30:21.133 --> 30:23.033
DORIE, YOU'VE JUST HAD
MAJOR ABDOMINAL SURGERY.

30:23.067 --> 30:24.767
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY CONDI--

30:24.800 --> 30:27.167
I'M GOING HOME, DR. GREY.
I NEED TO GO HOME.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.067
I CAN'T BE HERE.
I CAN'T WATCH THEM DIE.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.800
THEY'RE NOT DYING.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.467
THEY'RE TRYING TO LIVE.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.667
AND YOU LEAVING THEM
ISN'T GOING TO HELP THEM.

30:36.700 --> 30:39.433
I HAVE THREE BOYS
WHO NEED ME.

30:39.467 --> 30:41.200
YOUR DAUGHTERS NEED YOU.

30:41.233 --> 30:43.367
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT I CAN'T DO IT?

30:43.400 --> 30:45.367
I CAN'T DO IT.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.267
THEY'RE TOO SICK.
THEY'RE TOO HURT.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.633
WHICH IS WHY THEY NEED
THEIR MOTHER.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.033
IF EMILY DIES, I--

30:52.067 --> 30:55.667
IF EMILY DIES,
IT WILL BE HORRIBLE.

30:55.700 --> 30:59.233
BUT IF EMILY DIES,
AND YOU'RE NOT HERE...

30:59.267 --> 31:00.600
I CAN'T EVEN HOLD THEM.

31:00.633 --> 31:03.200
BUT YOU CAN SIT WITH THEM
AND TALK TO THEM

31:03.233 --> 31:05.500
AND LET THEM KNOW THEY'RE NOT
ALONE IN THIS WORLD.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.200
THAT'S ALL THEY NEED.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.733
THAT'S ALL ANYBODY...

31:11.267 --> 31:13.233
WHAT?

31:13.267 --> 31:16.167
I THINK I KNOW
HOW TO HELP CHARLOTTE.

31:20.733 --> 31:23.567
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS SOONER.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.467
IT'S CALLED COBEDDING.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.400
HOSPITALS SOMETIMES DO IT
WITH TWINS

31:28.433 --> 31:30.333
WHEN ONE OF THEM IS SICK.

31:30.367 --> 31:32.833
AND THE OTHER ONE GETS...
BETTER?

31:32.867 --> 31:35.133
IT HELPS.
HOW?

31:35.167 --> 31:36.500
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.

31:36.533 --> 31:40.367
SOMETIMES BABIES GET STRESSED
IN THE I.C.U.s

31:40.400 --> 31:42.233
FROM ALL THE ACTIVITY.

31:42.267 --> 31:45.500
THIS WAY, THERE'S SOMEONE
THERE TO COMFORT THEM,

31:45.533 --> 31:47.700
TO BE THERE WITH THEM.

31:55.367 --> 31:57.233
THAT'S EXCELLENT BLOOD FLOW
AT ALL THREE PLACES.

31:57.267 --> 31:58.767
YOU'RE HEALING
VERY NICELY.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.700
AND I LIKE MY NEW NOSE.

32:00.733 --> 32:02.633
WELL, I'M SURE YOUR WIFE
WILL LIKE IT, TOO.

32:02.667 --> 32:05.533
I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT SHE'LL
SAY ABOUT YOUR NEW HOUSEGUESTS.

32:05.567 --> 32:07.467
OH, I'M GONNA
LET THESE GUYS GO

32:07.500 --> 32:09.400
IN THE LAKE NEAR
MY FAVORITE HIKING TRAIL.

32:09.433 --> 32:11.333
SAVED MY FACE.
LEAST I CAN DO FOR 'EM.

32:11.367 --> 32:12.533
AND I DON'T HAVE A WIFE.

32:12.567 --> 32:14.333
OH, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOUR WEDDING RING...

32:14.367 --> 32:17.633
NO, I'M DIVORCED.
JUST NEVER TOOK IT OFF.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.233
BY THE WAY, UH...

32:20.267 --> 32:23.133
SORRY YOU HAD TO SEE
THAT LITTLE SCENE EARLIER.

32:23.167 --> 32:24.667
OH, YOU MEAN

32:24.700 --> 32:26.600
TALKING WITH THE GIRL
WHO ISN'T YOUR GIRLFRIEND

32:26.633 --> 32:28.767
ABOUT THE GIRL WHO YOU'D LIKE
TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.667
YEAH. SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID THAT STUFF.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.600
IT'S JUST--SHE WAS...

32:33.633 --> 32:35.800
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

32:35.833 --> 32:40.267
YEAH, BUT IS IT TRUE?

32:40.300 --> 32:43.167
DO YOU LIKE
THIS MEREDITH PERSON?

32:43.200 --> 32:46.067
I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

32:47.567 --> 32:50.333
SHE'S OKAY.

32:50.367 --> 32:52.633
I LIKE HER OKAY.

32:55.667 --> 32:57.300
ALL RIGHT, I LOVE HER.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.467
(laughs)

32:58.500 --> 33:00.400
OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

33:00.433 --> 33:02.400
I LOVED MY WIFE.

33:02.433 --> 33:05.067
BUT SOMETIMES, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE SOMEONE,

33:05.100 --> 33:09.133
THEY JUST CAN'T LOVE YOU BACK
IN THE SAME WAY.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.300
BELIEVE ME, SON.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.300
LIVING WITH A WOMAN
WHO CAN'T LOVE YOU BACK...

33:15.333 --> 33:17.700
WAY LONELIER
THAN BEING ALONE.

33:17.733 --> 33:19.633
(Woman) WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

33:19.667 --> 33:22.367
WE CAN--
WE CAN PUT HER ON ECMO.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.333
BABY THIS SIZE, YOU'RE RISKING
INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE.

33:24.367 --> 33:26.267
UM, SHE'S ALREADY CODED
THREE TIMES.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.067
YOU PAGED DR. SHEPHERD?

33:28.100 --> 33:29.800
SHE CALLED TO SAY YOU HAVE TO
HANDLE THIS FOR YOURSELF.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.800
WHAT? I'M AN INTERN.
WHAT IS SHE--

33:31.833 --> 33:33.800
DR. STEVENS?
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

33:33.833 --> 33:36.067
YOU DON'T HAVE A SECOND.
OKAY, ECMO IS TOO DANGEROUS.

33:36.067 --> 33:38.167
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP HER GOING ON EPI.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.567
TOO MUCH EPI,
IT'LL STOP HER CIRCULATION.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.567
THERE'S NO POINT IN KEEPING
HER HEART RATE UP

33:41.600 --> 33:44.400
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE FUNCTIONING
ARMS OR LEGS IN THE MORNING.

33:44.433 --> 33:45.400
I KNOW THAT.

33:45.433 --> 33:47.333
I'M SORRY.

33:47.367 --> 33:48.633
IT'S...

33:48.667 --> 33:51.100
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP PUSHING EPI.

33:51.133 --> 33:52.233
IT'S OUR BEST OPTION.

33:52.267 --> 33:55.133
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND
A MIDDLE GROUND.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.767
***

33:56.800 --> 33:58.300
YOU CAN DO THIS.

33:58.333 --> 34:01.233
***

34:14.500 --> 34:15.733
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD CONSIDER

34:15.767 --> 34:17.267
MOVING OUT OF YOUR TRAILER.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.633
THE VIEW ALONE...

34:18.667 --> 34:19.600
MM-HMM.

34:19.633 --> 34:21.500
SEE THE MIST
RISE OFF THE LAKE.

34:21.533 --> 34:22.467
YEAH.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.467
YEAH.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.800
I'M NOT MOVING.

34:26.833 --> 34:29.733
***

34:32.300 --> 34:33.500
YOU'RE STILL YOU?

34:33.533 --> 34:36.433
I'M STILL ME.

34:36.467 --> 34:38.533
GOOD.

34:45.167 --> 34:48.067
***

34:52.333 --> 34:53.600
WHERE'S EMILY?

34:53.633 --> 34:55.300
THEY TOOK HER AWAY.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.533
WHERE?
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME?

34:57.567 --> 34:59.400
DR. SHEPHERD TOLD US NOT TO.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.767
WHAT? WHERE IS THE BABY?

35:01.800 --> 35:05.167
DR. STEVENS,
SHE DIED HALF AN HOUR AGO.

35:05.200 --> 35:09.067
***

35:30.067 --> 35:32.767
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.133
YOU PUT ME IN CHARGE.
I FELL ASLEEP.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.367
I KILLED THAT BABY.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.733
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

35:38.767 --> 35:40.133
SHE WAS GONNA DIE ANYWAY.

35:40.167 --> 35:42.133
SHE HAD A RESTRICTED
ATRIAL SEPTUM

35:42.167 --> 35:44.067
AND VIRTUALLY NO AORTA.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.833
AS SOON AS DR. BURKE
OPENED UP HER CHEST,

35:45.867 --> 35:48.667
WE KNEW SHE DIDN'T HAVE
A CHANCE.

35:51.133 --> 35:53.067
I DON'T GET IT.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.800
YOU ORDERED ME
TO STAY THE NIGHT...
IZZIE.

35:54.833 --> 35:56.333
TAKE CARE OF HER.

35:56.367 --> 35:58.267
I WORKED MY ASS OFF
DOING C.P.R.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.167
AND PUMPING HER FULL
OF EVERY DRUG ON THE PLANET,

36:01.200 --> 36:04.067
AND, I MEAN, GOD, DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA HOW SCARED I WAS?

36:04.100 --> 36:06.667
IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING?
HARDLY.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.600
IF THE SITUATION
EVER COMES UP AGAIN,

36:08.633 --> 36:10.467
I KNOW YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO HANDLE THE PRESSURE.
YOU LIED TO ME.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.400
YOU HAVE TO LEARN DISTANCE,
STEVENS.

36:12.433 --> 36:14.367
YOU'LL BE A BETTER DOCTOR
FOR IT.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.500
A BETTER--
A BETTER DOCTOR?

36:32.167 --> 36:34.067
I HEARD YOU WORKED
A MIRACLE LAST NIGHT.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.100
SHE CAME AROUND SO FAST,

36:36.133 --> 36:38.333
I THOUGHT THE EQUIPMENT
WAS MALFUNCTIONING.

36:38.367 --> 36:40.233
HER SATS
ARE COMPLETELY STABLE.

36:40.267 --> 36:42.333
SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.500
GO HOME, GREY.

36:44.533 --> 36:46.233
YOU'VE EARNED IT.

36:46.267 --> 36:48.800
AND, GREY...

36:48.833 --> 36:50.733
WAY TO GO.

36:54.067 --> 36:57.500
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
"WAY TO GO."

37:10.200 --> 37:11.367
MY BABY DIED.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.667
WE KNOW.

37:13.700 --> 37:19.133
SHE JUST... DIED.

37:25.300 --> 37:27.467
I HAVE AN IDEA.

37:32.233 --> 37:35.133
***

37:50.600 --> 37:54.067
THE FIRST PERSON I KILLED...

37:54.067 --> 37:56.800
I WAS A SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT.

37:56.833 --> 37:59.733
JAMES HANSON.

38:01.800 --> 38:05.567
YOU SHOULD GO HOME, ALEX.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO HERE.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.600
***

38:08.633 --> 38:11.233
NOBODY SHOULD DIE ALONE.

38:12.467 --> 38:15.667
400 YEARS AGO,
ANOTHER WELL-KNOWN ENGLISH GUY

38:15.700 --> 38:18.233
HAD AN OPINION
ABOUT BEING ALONE--

38:18.267 --> 38:20.100
JOHN DONNE.

38:20.133 --> 38:23.267
HE THOUGHT
WE WERE NEVER ALONE.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.633
OF COURSE, IT WAS FANCIER
WHEN HE SAID IT.

38:25.667 --> 38:28.200
DON'T--DON'T TRY
AND TALK.

38:28.233 --> 38:29.567
YOUR WINDPIPE
WAS PERFORATED.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.200
DR. BURKE REPAIRED IT,
AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.

38:33.233 --> 38:36.433
***

38:36.467 --> 38:40.133
WE'LL KEEP YOU HERE AT LEAST
TEN DAYS FOR OBSERVATION

38:40.167 --> 38:42.367
AND MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO INFECTION.

38:47.733 --> 38:49.633
MAYBE JUST TO BE
ON THE SAFE SIDE,

38:49.667 --> 38:51.500
WE'LL MAKE IT TWO WEEKS.

38:51.533 --> 38:54.533
***

38:54.567 --> 38:56.233
NO MAN IS AN ISLAND

38:56.267 --> 38:59.533

39:07.067 --> 39:08.667
OH.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.067
THAT'S HIM.

39:10.067 --> 39:12.200
YEAH. THAT'S HIM.

39:12.233 --> 39:15.633
***

39:19.533 --> 39:22.333
I'M LONELY, DEREK.

39:26.300 --> 39:30.067
BOIL DOWN THAT ISLAND TALK,
AND HE JUST MEANT

39:30.067 --> 39:32.767
THAT ALL ANYONE NEEDS
IS SOMEONE TO STEP IN...
