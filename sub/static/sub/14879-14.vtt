00:37.063 --> 00:39.098
Was that the gun?

00:39.165 --> 00:40.934
There's like 20,000 people
in front of us.

00:41.002 --> 00:42.802
It's gonna be a while
before we go.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.603
I'm actually kinda surprised
you showed up.

00:44.671 --> 00:45.972
I mean that in a good way.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.038
I just didn't know that
you had kept training

00:48.105 --> 00:50.105
after you moved out.

00:50.172 --> 00:52.774
Yeah, got up at 6:00 a.m.
every morning.

00:52.842 --> 00:54.576
And you got the time off
from work.

00:54.644 --> 00:56.477
- Because usually--
- Hey.

00:56.544 --> 00:57.944
I'm here.

00:58.012 --> 00:59.647
Okay?

01:38.981 --> 01:41.281
Ten years at the agency
I could never get a meeting

01:41.348 --> 01:43.248
with the DCS
and now...

01:43.316 --> 01:46.617
he drives all the way out here
to Petersburg just to see me.

01:46.685 --> 01:48.351
Max Langford.

01:48.419 --> 01:51.720
The face of a traitor.

01:51.787 --> 01:54.355
I figured that sort
of reductive jingoism

01:54.423 --> 01:57.425
might be beneath you.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.260
What do you call a CIA analyst

01:59.328 --> 02:01.829
convicted on 12 counts
of treason?

02:01.897 --> 02:04.497
A patriot?

02:04.565 --> 02:08.600
I doubt you came all the way
out here just to insult me.

02:08.668 --> 02:10.669
Does the name Yuri Trubachev
mean anything to you?

02:10.735 --> 02:15.138
Yeah, he's a top engineer
for the Russian nuclear program.

02:15.206 --> 02:18.741
He's a CIA asset since the end
of the Cold War.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.844
You know he was murdered
yesterday in Red Square.

02:20.912 --> 02:23.914
They don't exactly allow me
to surf the web around here.

02:23.982 --> 02:25.381
There are only 12 people
at the Agency

02:25.449 --> 02:27.917
that knew Trubachev
was CIA asset.

02:27.985 --> 02:30.319
I'm looking for information

02:30.386 --> 02:32.320
on how his identity
could have been compromised.

02:32.388 --> 02:33.921
I spend 23 hours a day

02:33.989 --> 02:36.157
walking around
a 68-square-foot room

02:36.224 --> 02:39.327
and I can count on one hand
the number of human beings

02:39.395 --> 02:41.328
that I have spoken to
in the last year.

02:41.396 --> 02:44.697
So if you're looking for someone
with their ear to the ground,

02:44.765 --> 02:48.333
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong place.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.801
Forgive me if I don't weep
with sympathy

02:49.869 --> 02:51.869
for your living conditions.

02:51.937 --> 02:53.838
That's funny, you know...

02:53.906 --> 02:57.341
An American sells a secret
to the Russians, he's a traitor.

02:57.409 --> 03:01.412
But a Russian sells secrets
to us, and he's a hero.

03:01.479 --> 03:04.848
And a man who sells out
his agency...

03:04.916 --> 03:06.082
is a prisoner.

03:06.150 --> 03:08.484
Have a nice life.

03:09.986 --> 03:13.822
Wish I could help you.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.364
Joan. Call in your team.

03:24.432 --> 03:27.367
Langford doesn't just know
something about this murder...

03:27.434 --> 03:29.234
He's behind it.

04:20.293 --> 04:24.498
I mean, the chafing.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.171
I missed this.

04:31.239 --> 04:33.307
Us.

04:33.375 --> 04:36.945
Annie. We need you back
in the office.

04:37.012 --> 04:39.748
If this is some elaborate scam
to get you out of running,

04:39.816 --> 04:41.717
I'd actually be pretty
impressed.

04:41.785 --> 04:44.920
I guess I gotta go.

04:44.987 --> 04:48.122
No, you're right.
Whatever...Stan is blowing up

04:48.190 --> 04:50.692
needs you more than I do.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.094
You sure?

04:52.161 --> 04:55.397
I'll be fine.
Seriously.

05:13.683 --> 05:15.384
Hey.

05:15.452 --> 05:17.053
I know that look.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.855
Oh, you know all my looks.

05:18.922 --> 05:20.690
So why do you think Max
is our guy?

05:20.757 --> 05:23.459
He was a born analyst.
He thrives on information.

05:23.527 --> 05:25.095
- You know what he asked me today?
- What?

05:25.162 --> 05:28.098
Nothing.
Not a single question.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.766
Even after I clearly came
to him

05:29.834 --> 05:32.202
looking to discuss
an active case.

05:32.270 --> 05:34.938
It's hard to believe he could
accomplish something like this

05:35.006 --> 05:36.673
from solitary confinement.

05:36.741 --> 05:38.842
Nicholson did a decade ago.

05:38.910 --> 05:42.545
Max is that kind of analyst--
brilliant and wily as hell.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.981
I bet he savors the challenge.

05:45.049 --> 05:47.149
Max Langford was a dark chapter
for our agency.

05:47.217 --> 05:48.417
Three operatives killed,

05:48.485 --> 05:49.885
an entire department
compromised.

05:49.953 --> 05:52.521
Took us years to recover.

05:52.589 --> 05:54.356
I understand
the DCI's concern.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.024
Completely.

05:56.092 --> 06:01.195
And his need to loop you in.

06:01.263 --> 06:02.629
What do you mean?

06:02.697 --> 06:04.598
I mean, if this thing
goes sideways,

06:04.665 --> 06:07.234
who better to point a finger at
then somebody who not only

06:07.302 --> 06:09.603
knew Langford but knew
the players

06:09.671 --> 06:11.172
and knows where the bodies are?

06:13.508 --> 06:15.575
Let 'em point.

06:15.643 --> 06:19.712
I'm stopping this bastard
here and now.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.581
Working theory.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.751
Max Langford has established
and is maintaining an intel ring

06:24.819 --> 06:26.186
from prison.

06:26.254 --> 06:27.855
We believe this ring may have
been responsible

06:27.923 --> 06:29.924
for the death of an asset
in Moscow yesterday.

06:29.992 --> 06:33.261
We mean to discover his methods
and shut it down.

06:33.329 --> 06:36.365
Every aspect of Max's life--
his past, his present--

06:36.433 --> 06:38.601
will be dissected and examined.

06:38.668 --> 06:42.005
Everyone he knows--his lawyers,
his family, his friends.

06:42.072 --> 06:44.841
No stone unturned.
Auggie?

06:44.908 --> 06:47.344
Max has two daughters.

06:47.411 --> 06:50.046
The older sister Bebe
owns a gift shop in Alexandria.

06:50.114 --> 06:51.881
Despite being only
two hours away,

06:51.949 --> 06:54.684
she's never visited her father
in prison.

06:54.752 --> 06:57.821
Our leading candidate
is Max's other daughter Grace.

06:57.889 --> 07:00.791
Grace moved to work at
a horse farm near Petersburg

07:00.859 --> 07:02.226
so she could be closer
to her dad.

07:02.293 --> 07:04.895
Grace and Max's lawyer
are the only two people

07:04.962 --> 07:06.663
who have visited him
in prison.

07:06.731 --> 07:09.766
Grace visits him every week
and she's our likely target.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.635
Jillian, you take Bebe.

07:11.703 --> 07:13.437
Annie, I want you on Grace.

07:13.504 --> 07:14.838
Collins, you're with me.

07:14.906 --> 07:16.140
We'll liaise with legal
about Max's lawyer.

07:16.207 --> 07:18.642
Everybody else,
let's get to work.

07:21.479 --> 07:22.880
Just think, you could be
gutting it out

07:22.947 --> 07:24.782
at mile 21 right now.

07:24.849 --> 07:27.151
Which Danielle is doing
without me.

07:27.218 --> 07:29.319
Her and 20,000 strangers.

07:29.387 --> 07:30.787
I gotta tell you, Auggie,

07:30.855 --> 07:32.623
this job is not great
for sisterly bonding.

07:32.691 --> 07:34.358
I am trying to do
damage control,

07:34.426 --> 07:37.195
and I feel like all I ever do
is apologize.

07:37.262 --> 07:39.264
Giver her some credit.
She knows you're trying.

07:39.331 --> 07:41.566
- You think?
- I do.

07:41.634 --> 07:43.435
And you are.

07:43.502 --> 07:48.340
Now, attention, class.
Today's lesson--horses.

07:48.407 --> 07:49.841
What about them?

07:49.909 --> 07:51.310
Your target's a veterinarian.

07:51.377 --> 07:52.778
Grace works at a facility

07:52.846 --> 07:54.280
that breeds and cares
for race horses.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.015
Your cover is a journalist.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.785
<i>Breeder's Magazine.</i>
No joke.

07:58.852 --> 08:01.454
Here are some back issues.
I read it for the articles.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.156
You should've pulled Danielle
out of the marathon.

08:03.223 --> 08:04.657
She's the real horse buff
of this family.

08:04.725 --> 08:07.325
But you're the better
operative, and from what I hear,

08:07.393 --> 08:09.394
you've gotten a few ribbons
yourself.

08:09.462 --> 08:11.296
It's in your file.
I know it's creepy.

08:11.363 --> 08:12.730
You know what's creepy?

08:12.798 --> 08:13.998
I'm getting used
to the creepiness.

08:14.065 --> 08:16.266
A good reporter needs
three things.

08:16.334 --> 08:18.535
A mini recorder,
a reporter's tablet,

08:18.602 --> 08:19.802
and the truth.

08:19.870 --> 08:20.903
Thanks, Professor.

08:20.971 --> 08:24.273
There will be a quiz later.

08:28.912 --> 08:31.714
- Good morning, Emily.
- Good morning!

08:31.782 --> 08:33.448
I was told to tell you
that the Langford mission

08:33.517 --> 08:36.219
is a DPD assignment.

08:36.287 --> 08:40.456
Langford mission?

08:40.524 --> 08:42.759
I didn't even know
that was in play.

08:42.827 --> 08:44.427
Fine.
Um...

08:44.495 --> 08:47.497
Keep my Asian Humint debrief.
Don't cancel it.

08:47.565 --> 08:50.266
Actually, they called.
They wanna reschedule.

08:50.334 --> 08:51.834
To when?

08:51.902 --> 08:55.070
They said
they'd get back to us.

08:55.137 --> 08:57.339
Okay.
Thank you.

09:28.172 --> 09:29.472
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Grace.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.974
Do you know where she is?

09:31.042 --> 09:34.076
Thanks.

09:40.217 --> 09:42.317
- You're a reporter.
- That's right.

09:42.385 --> 09:44.753
Annie Walker.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

09:44.821 --> 09:46.689
I'm afraid you came a long way
for nothing, Ms. Walker.

09:46.756 --> 09:48.224
I don't talk to the press.

09:48.292 --> 09:50.126
You don't?
Why's that?

09:50.194 --> 09:51.328
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

09:51.395 --> 09:54.164
Does your employer
know about this?

09:54.232 --> 09:57.935
Wouldn't he consider an article
about your care and treatment

09:58.002 --> 10:01.572
of his retired race animals
beneficial to his business?

10:01.640 --> 10:05.275
Frankly, my editor and I
really admire your stand,

10:05.343 --> 10:07.310
and we'd like to help you
make your case...

10:07.378 --> 10:09.012
If you'd let us.

10:09.079 --> 10:11.480
Oh. I thought you were
interested in something else.

10:11.548 --> 10:15.217
I get a lot of visits
from the press.

10:15.285 --> 10:16.986
What else
are they interested in?

10:17.054 --> 10:20.322
Nothing.

10:20.390 --> 10:22.190
I usually have to say
something

10:22.258 --> 10:25.327
before somebody asks me
to leave.

10:25.394 --> 10:26.528
Um, is this a bad time?

10:26.596 --> 10:28.196
Actually, it is.

10:28.264 --> 10:30.498
If I'd known--
I have an existing appointment.

10:30.566 --> 10:32.333
That's okay.
Could we reschedule?

10:32.401 --> 10:35.971
I have a demanding editor
and a deadline.

10:36.038 --> 10:38.673
- Who are you with again?
- <i>Breeder's Magazine.</i>

10:38.741 --> 10:41.042
Ah. Studs-R-Us.

10:41.109 --> 10:43.845
We prefer Studs Monthly.

10:43.913 --> 10:45.880
Uh, how about tomorrow?
Say 11:00?

10:45.948 --> 10:47.281
That'd be great.

11:11.474 --> 11:12.841
Hi.

11:12.909 --> 11:15.444
What are those famous
Walker instincts telling you?

11:15.512 --> 11:18.314
I got a good vibe,
basically, if a brief one.

11:18.382 --> 11:21.051
She couldn't talk.
So I'm gonna see her tomorrow.

11:21.119 --> 11:23.220
I don't know,
underneath it all,

11:23.288 --> 11:26.256
she seemed kinda fragile.

11:26.324 --> 11:27.691
- She couldn't talk.
- Why?

11:27.759 --> 11:29.793
I don't know.
But I'm about to find out.

11:29.861 --> 11:31.661
- I'm following her.
- You need assistance?

11:31.729 --> 11:34.163
- I can get a team there.
- No. I'm good.

11:34.231 --> 11:36.232
She doesn't have any idea.

11:36.299 --> 11:37.833
Or doesn't seem to care.

11:37.901 --> 11:40.202
Or she's very good.

11:40.269 --> 11:43.171
I have to get back to you,
Auggie.

12:12.371 --> 12:15.007
Adnan al-Raheeb.
A Saudi with a history.

12:15.075 --> 12:17.076
Arms dealing most significantly,
but not exclusively.

12:17.144 --> 12:19.679
Could you overhear
their conversation?

12:19.747 --> 12:21.180
No, I was too far away.

12:21.248 --> 12:25.851
His weapons customers include
FSB's Spetsnaz force.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.386
There's our Russian
connection.

12:27.454 --> 12:28.721
Good work, Annie.

12:28.788 --> 12:31.556
It looks like we might've found
our traitor.

12:36.981 --> 12:38.797
We've pored over
all the transcripts

12:38.798 --> 12:41.333
and recordings of Grace's prison
visits with her father,

12:41.401 --> 12:43.937
and discovered the probable
means of conveying information.

12:44.005 --> 12:47.074
Chess. Barber.
Okay.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.376
Langford and Grace are playing
a long-term game of chess,

12:49.444 --> 12:50.945
that's one move per visit.

12:51.012 --> 12:53.280
So at the end of every visit,
he'll say something like

12:53.348 --> 12:55.816
"Knight to Rook four."

12:55.884 --> 12:58.219
He's allowed a chess board
in his cell?

12:58.287 --> 12:59.987
No, we're assuming he's
keeping the entire board

13:00.055 --> 13:01.255
in his head.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.091
Not easy, but he was
a brilliant analyst.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.160
Yeah,
this is definitely code.

13:06.228 --> 13:10.131
I mean, the only problem is
there are hundreds of thousands

13:10.199 --> 13:11.699
of possible moves
on a chess board.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.534
This is chess, okay,
not checkers.

13:13.602 --> 13:15.036
So each piece could be
representative

13:15.104 --> 13:16.437
of different variables.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.339
We need to gain access
to Grace's house

13:18.407 --> 13:20.175
to try to search for a key
or a cipher.

13:20.242 --> 13:21.809
And because you have
the relationship with Grace,

13:21.877 --> 13:23.311
you're gonna be in charge
of distracting her

13:23.379 --> 13:27.382
and keeping her out while
the tech team scours her house.

13:27.450 --> 13:31.519
A lot of five-year-olds are
just as fast as a stake horse.

13:31.587 --> 13:35.824
But for the racing world,
fate has passed them by.

13:35.891 --> 13:37.292
I'm ashamed to admit it,

13:37.359 --> 13:39.594
considering I'm supposed
to be an expert,

13:39.662 --> 13:42.230
but even though I've been
around horses my entire life

13:42.298 --> 13:45.500
I've never ridden
a thoroughbred.

13:45.568 --> 13:47.202
Until today.

13:47.269 --> 13:49.070
Come on.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.587
See what I mean?

14:05.654 --> 14:07.656
I get it now.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.090
As much fun as this is
for you,

14:09.158 --> 14:10.925
it's even more fun
for the horses.

14:10.993 --> 14:12.827
That horse your riding on?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.829
He fractured his leg
at Pimlico.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.065
A lot of folks said it wasn't
worth the money or effort

14:17.132 --> 14:19.033
to try to heal him.

14:19.101 --> 14:21.869
But I believe rehabilitation
is always possible...

14:21.936 --> 14:23.136
And worth it.

14:41.556 --> 14:43.258
We should probably start
heading back.

14:43.325 --> 14:44.692
We don't have to go
on my account.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.127
I'd love to stay out too,

14:46.195 --> 14:48.229
but we need to get the horses
back to be fed.

14:48.297 --> 14:50.365
Come on, we'll really open it up
on the way home.

14:50.433 --> 14:52.133
- Okay.
- Let's go!

15:01.576 --> 15:02.910
Incoming.

15:02.978 --> 15:04.545
Incoming, guys.
Wrap it up.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.514
We gotta go out the other door.
Out the other door.

15:28.235 --> 15:31.771
Thanks.

15:31.838 --> 15:33.472
Thanks so much.
That was really fun.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.841
Anytime.

15:50.757 --> 15:53.592
Wow.
It's a little stuffy in here.

15:53.659 --> 15:55.294
So do you have to run
right now,

15:55.361 --> 15:57.228
or would you like a glass
of wine?

15:57.296 --> 15:58.930
Thanks, I'd love a glass.

15:58.998 --> 16:00.298
Finally.

16:00.366 --> 16:01.933
Talk to me, Barber.

16:02.001 --> 16:03.502
We got outta there
in the Nick of time, man.

16:03.569 --> 16:04.936
It was close.

16:05.004 --> 16:06.871
You always say it was close.
Is it ever not close?

16:06.939 --> 16:09.007
Seriously, this time
was ridiculous.

16:09.075 --> 16:11.376
And the intel?
Anything promising?

16:11.443 --> 16:12.777
Well, no key or cipher.

16:12.845 --> 16:14.312
We got plenty of pics
to drill down.

16:14.379 --> 16:18.416
Good work, Barber.
See you soon.

16:18.484 --> 16:20.751
- Got a minute, Auggie?
- Jai, is that you?

16:20.819 --> 16:22.553
No fragrance today?

16:22.621 --> 16:24.921
You wanna grab a beer
after work?

16:24.989 --> 16:26.490
Yeah, sure.
Allen's tavern?

16:26.557 --> 16:30.026
Let's class it up a bit.
W hotel bar?

16:30.094 --> 16:34.030
I'll bring my evening cane.

16:34.098 --> 16:35.932
So...I've been thinking
about it,

16:35.999 --> 16:38.267
and I owe you a bit
of an apology

16:38.334 --> 16:39.735
for the way I acted yesterday.

16:39.802 --> 16:41.303
What do you mean?

16:41.370 --> 16:43.571
Well, when you approached
and said you were a reporter,

16:43.639 --> 16:47.141
I assumed you wanted to talk
about my father.

16:47.209 --> 16:51.244
Your father?

16:51.312 --> 16:54.014
He was a CIA operative.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.315
And he got caught up
in a scandal.

16:57.685 --> 17:00.454
What kinda scandal?

17:04.492 --> 17:08.862
Um...He allegedly...

17:08.930 --> 17:14.434
sold secrets to the Russians.

17:14.502 --> 17:18.137
And now he's in prison for it.

17:18.204 --> 17:23.040
The whole thing is kinda murky
and, well, you know the CIA.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.343
What do you mean?

17:25.411 --> 17:30.114
Well, they're not exactly
a paragon of morals or ethics.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.749
Maybe he was set up.

17:31.817 --> 17:35.553
Um...Do you see him?

17:35.621 --> 17:37.256
What's your relationship?

17:37.324 --> 17:38.658
Good.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.293
I do see him.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.929
You can't believe everything
you read in the papers.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.063
Meaning?

17:44.131 --> 17:45.631
Meaning
at the end of the day,

17:45.699 --> 17:47.834
I believe
he's still a patriot.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.770
A lot of the things
he was convicted of...

17:50.838 --> 17:52.605
Anyway, it's complicated.

17:52.673 --> 17:54.775
I have a complicated
relationship with my dad too.

17:54.842 --> 17:57.244
Because of things he did?

17:57.311 --> 17:59.012
Decisions he made?

17:59.080 --> 18:00.380
Yeah.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.084
This is lovely.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.252
Oh, yes.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.488
But the allegory is kinda sad.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.824
My dad and I are playing a game.

18:10.891 --> 18:13.126
At each visit,
I give him one move.

18:13.194 --> 18:16.462
At the next, he gives me his.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.597
How does that work?

18:17.664 --> 18:22.235
Slowly.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.038
Bebe!

18:25.105 --> 18:29.876
Oh...My God. Did you carry that
all the way from Mexico?

18:29.943 --> 18:32.111
For my little sister,
absolutely.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.813
Aww.

18:33.881 --> 18:35.014
I missed you.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.449
So how was your trip?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.151
Hot, incredibly.

18:38.218 --> 18:43.123
Anyway, this supposedly
signifies the seven deadly sins.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.591
I didn't completely get it,

18:44.659 --> 18:45.960
but apparently the town is
famous for these

18:46.027 --> 18:47.128
and I thought you'd like it.

18:47.195 --> 18:48.696
I love it.

18:48.764 --> 18:50.331
Hi. Do I know you?

18:50.399 --> 18:52.900
Uh, no. Hi.
I'm Annie.

18:52.968 --> 18:55.069
Annie is a reporter.
This is my sister Bebe.

18:55.137 --> 18:58.373
A reporter.
Grace...I mean, really?

18:58.440 --> 19:02.543
Annie is doing an article
on horse farms.

19:02.611 --> 19:04.945
Horse farms.

19:05.013 --> 19:08.515
- Well, anyway--
- You've had a long trip.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.384
Do you happen to have my mail
by any chance?

19:10.451 --> 19:11.918
Oh, yeah.

19:11.986 --> 19:13.487
Oh.

19:13.555 --> 19:16.156
Sorry, I have to take this.
Hello?

19:16.224 --> 19:17.792
Yes, I can hold.
Here you go.

19:17.859 --> 19:19.527
Thanks.

19:19.595 --> 19:20.962
Good evening, Mr. al-Raheeb.

19:21.030 --> 19:25.100
Thank you for getting
back to me.

19:25.168 --> 19:27.436
What magazine did you say
that you work for?

19:27.504 --> 19:29.138
Hmm?

19:29.206 --> 19:31.741
Your article on horse farms.

19:31.809 --> 19:33.376
Oh, uh, it's for
<i>Breeder's Magazine.</i>

19:33.444 --> 19:37.014
What was your last name again?

19:37.081 --> 19:38.148
'Cause I just wanna pull up
the masthead.

19:38.216 --> 19:40.217
Walker.

19:40.285 --> 19:41.585
Annie Walker.

19:41.653 --> 19:43.120
But I'm writing this
as a freelancer.

19:43.187 --> 19:46.623
Grace is a very trusting soul.

19:46.691 --> 19:49.125
Much more trusting
than me.

19:49.193 --> 19:52.095
You know, I mean,
even after everything

19:52.163 --> 19:54.297
that our father's done to us,

19:54.365 --> 19:56.700
she just won't turn her back
on him.

19:56.768 --> 19:59.570
She can't.
She sees the good in people.

19:59.638 --> 20:01.039
No matter what.

20:01.107 --> 20:02.674
I can understand that.

20:02.742 --> 20:04.576
If you're misrepresenting
yourself to her

20:04.644 --> 20:07.280
or you have some kind
of agenda

20:07.348 --> 20:09.983
to get some scoop
on our father,

20:10.051 --> 20:12.986
I'm asking you now nicely
to stop.

20:13.053 --> 20:16.289
Um, I can assure you
you have nothing to worry about.

20:16.356 --> 20:18.324
I hope not.

20:19.726 --> 20:22.262
I'm sorry about that.
Business.

20:22.329 --> 20:24.631
No, that's fine.
I should get going anyway.

20:24.699 --> 20:25.833
It's a long drive.

20:25.900 --> 20:26.900
Well, let me
walk you out then.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.735
Okay, great.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.343
Call me if you have
any more questions.

20:36.411 --> 20:37.577
Thank you.

20:37.645 --> 20:38.846
We should do this again
sometime.

20:38.913 --> 20:40.147
I'd like that.

20:49.324 --> 20:52.059
Bebe definitely photographed
the chess board.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.527
We've got techint data-mining
e-communications

20:53.595 --> 20:55.095
out of Virginia now.

20:55.163 --> 20:57.064
I don't know how complicit
Grace even is.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.532
Maybe not at all.

20:58.599 --> 21:01.735
Well, we are
in agreement there.

21:01.803 --> 21:05.206
The file that Grace exchanged
with al-Raheeb was a job offer.

21:05.273 --> 21:06.974
Al-Raheeb is trying to poach
Grace away

21:07.041 --> 21:08.642
from Willow Stream Farm

21:08.709 --> 21:10.043
in order to take care
of his own stables.

21:10.111 --> 21:11.745
This is a copy of the file.
How'd we get this?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.514
Gotta love Saudi Arabian
intelligence.

21:13.582 --> 21:17.385
They're not big on the whole
privacy laws thing.

21:17.453 --> 21:18.887
So what's the play?

21:18.955 --> 21:21.924
We want you to turn Grace
against Bebe.

21:21.992 --> 21:24.927
We feel fracturing the sisters
is the best way to do it.

21:24.995 --> 21:27.664
- And psych ops agrees.
- Psych ops?

21:27.732 --> 21:30.701
We had a psychological profile
drawn up on both of the sisters.

21:30.768 --> 21:34.638
Bebe's motivations are clear--
financial need.

21:34.706 --> 21:36.006
Her gift shop
isn't doing so well

21:36.073 --> 21:37.373
since the economic downturn,

21:37.441 --> 21:38.674
and she has parental issues

21:38.742 --> 21:40.109
that Freud could write
a whole new book about.

21:40.177 --> 21:41.678
Bebe and Grace
are really close.

21:41.745 --> 21:43.913
I know, that's the point.
That's the key.

21:43.981 --> 21:45.682
These prison records show

21:45.750 --> 21:47.684
that Bebe visited her father
weekly

21:47.752 --> 21:49.319
and she was lying to Grace.

21:49.387 --> 21:51.454
You need to show those to Grace
in order to turn her.

21:51.522 --> 21:54.523
I don't understand.
I th--

21:54.591 --> 21:57.160
Annie,
prison records are fake.

21:57.227 --> 21:59.028
We need to drive a wedge
between the sisters

21:59.096 --> 22:00.630
and this is the best way
to do it.

22:02.866 --> 22:04.100
Really?

22:04.168 --> 22:06.269
Forging prison records
is our only option?

22:06.337 --> 22:07.504
I don't think
that's gonna hold up.

22:07.571 --> 22:09.038
It will if you sell it right.

22:09.106 --> 22:10.473
They're sisters.

22:10.541 --> 22:12.042
Grace will see right
through this.

22:12.109 --> 22:13.743
Well, if you have
a better tactic,

22:13.811 --> 22:16.980
please speak up.

22:17.048 --> 22:19.182
Joan, I don't think
I can do this.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.851
You think your own situation
with your sister

22:20.919 --> 22:22.386
is clouding your judgment?

22:22.454 --> 22:27.392
I think my own situation
is clarifying my judgment.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.562
Annie, I have three sisters.

22:30.630 --> 22:32.564
You don't own a monopoly
on sibling drama.

22:32.632 --> 22:35.667
Every family, every situation
is different.

22:35.735 --> 22:38.370
So you need to put that sense
of moral outrage in check,

22:38.438 --> 22:40.705
because this is real.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.106
Real lives are at stake.

22:42.174 --> 22:44.108
This is what we do.

22:44.175 --> 22:47.577
I think my emotions
will impair my ability

22:47.645 --> 22:50.514
to do this mission well.

22:50.581 --> 22:54.185
So I'm not doing it.

23:17.808 --> 23:19.042
Hey!

23:19.109 --> 23:23.112
It's late.
What are you doing here?

23:23.180 --> 23:24.414
Did you finish the race?

23:24.482 --> 23:27.116
Yes.

23:29.486 --> 23:31.553
It was exhilarating.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.922
I've never done
anything like that.

23:33.989 --> 23:36.624
And I never will again.

23:36.692 --> 23:39.594
- I'm so sore.
- Aw.

23:39.661 --> 23:44.198
Poor baby.
I won't give you a hug.

23:44.266 --> 23:47.001
Oh, you're the best!

23:47.069 --> 23:48.369
Can you get the thing
with the thingy?

23:48.437 --> 23:50.438
Yeah.

24:06.722 --> 24:10.191
Do you ever think about dad?

24:10.259 --> 24:11.693
Is that why you're here?

24:11.761 --> 24:15.230
Maybe.

24:17.099 --> 24:20.301
I think about
how he lied to us.

24:20.369 --> 24:23.871
I think about
how he lied to mom.

24:23.939 --> 24:27.576
I thought about him
when you lied to me.

24:27.643 --> 24:29.177
Did you ever think there was
another version of the story?

24:29.244 --> 24:31.012
I mean, we only ever heard
mom's side.

24:31.079 --> 24:33.181
Oh, I don't know, you had a
better relationship with him.

24:33.249 --> 24:34.716
No, I did not.
You did.

24:34.784 --> 24:36.617
Another question
left to ponder.

24:39.989 --> 24:41.322
I'm gonna go.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.725
You have a husband
and two kids to take care of.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.560
A husband
who's still at work

24:45.628 --> 24:47.594
and two kids who are asleep.

24:47.662 --> 24:49.696
It's a moment of peace.

24:49.764 --> 24:52.832
Enjoy it.

24:55.402 --> 24:58.938
- Ow.
- Ugh.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.176
- Hey, Annie.
- Yeah.

25:04.244 --> 25:07.514
I'm glad we didn't have to do
the whole apology thing again.

25:07.581 --> 25:09.549
Me too.

25:17.026 --> 25:20.162
There's a hot blonde at your
10:00 giving you the eye.

25:20.230 --> 25:22.498
She must not be
into Indian guys.

25:24.467 --> 25:27.169
Alpha-male
compliment-slash-dig aside,

25:27.236 --> 25:28.938
I'm taken.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.440
Giving the other D.C.
bachelors a fighting chance.

25:31.508 --> 25:34.044
You didn't invite me down here
to be your wingman.

25:34.111 --> 25:35.312
What did I invite you
down here for?

25:35.380 --> 25:37.181
I don't know.

25:37.248 --> 25:39.450
But we've never had drinks
together, just you and me, ever.

25:39.518 --> 25:41.919
So you must want something.

25:41.986 --> 25:44.188
Okay.

25:44.255 --> 25:46.123
I need advice.

25:46.191 --> 25:48.392
Jai, I don't know
why the blonde at 10:00

25:48.460 --> 25:49.893
isn't into Indian guys.

25:49.961 --> 25:51.495
Work advice.

25:51.563 --> 25:53.564
You're the one
with Langley dialed.

25:53.632 --> 25:55.499
And you're the one
with a connected father

25:55.567 --> 25:57.601
and a fat new office
under the DCI.

25:57.669 --> 25:58.969
What's it called again?

25:59.037 --> 26:00.872
Office of special projects.

26:00.939 --> 26:03.341
We interface amongst
the various directorates

26:03.408 --> 26:05.343
and help exploit
efficiency opportunities

26:05.411 --> 26:07.311
to minimize bureaucracy.

26:07.379 --> 26:09.481
You lost me at interface.

26:09.548 --> 26:14.486
Look, OSP has the opportunity
to help the Agency

26:14.554 --> 26:16.855
reinvent itself post-UBL.

26:16.923 --> 26:19.190
I have a budget,
I have autonomy.

26:19.258 --> 26:20.325
But I'm hemmed in.

26:20.393 --> 26:22.160
I can't get any
internal traction.

26:22.228 --> 26:23.628
As big a budget as we have,

26:23.696 --> 26:25.797
the CIA is not
a budget-driven agency, Jai.

26:25.865 --> 26:27.532
It's a people-driven agency.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.200
Doesn't matter
how big your wallet is.

26:29.268 --> 26:31.870
You need a few good hires
to create a critical mass.

26:31.937 --> 26:34.072
If you hire, they will come.

26:34.140 --> 26:35.940
You interested?

26:36.008 --> 26:39.310
Nice try.

26:39.378 --> 26:42.113
Cheers.

26:59.495 --> 27:01.329
Mind if I join you?

27:04.800 --> 27:07.469
Hi, uh...
Two more please.

27:07.537 --> 27:09.638
And I'll start a tab.

27:09.705 --> 27:11.373
Thanks.

27:13.075 --> 27:15.010
I haven't been here
in years.

27:15.078 --> 27:17.713
Not since I was a field op.

27:17.781 --> 27:19.882
Chili dog still good?

27:19.950 --> 27:22.385
Surprisingly good actually.

27:25.122 --> 27:28.591
You're not here to give me
a pep talk, are you?

27:28.659 --> 27:30.060
Here to tell me
to do the job?

27:30.127 --> 27:33.664
Yes, that's right.

27:33.732 --> 27:37.268
Annie, I understand your
sensitivity to this mission.

27:37.336 --> 27:39.370
But due to Max Langford's
recent actions,

27:39.438 --> 27:41.439
we've had to suspend
all of our Moscow operations

27:41.507 --> 27:43.741
and we are flying blind
in Russia right now.

27:45.877 --> 27:48.979
I know you feel that
your personal situation

27:49.047 --> 27:51.848
is getting in the way
of your ability.

27:51.916 --> 27:53.483
But it's that sensitivity

27:53.551 --> 27:56.119
that makes you the exact
right person for the job.

27:56.186 --> 28:00.823
That's why I picked you.
And I think you know that.

28:04.228 --> 28:05.762
Thanks.

28:05.830 --> 28:09.500
However you wanna get
the mission done is up to you.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.635
But get the mission done.

28:15.307 --> 28:16.909
I'll get it done.

28:21.781 --> 28:22.781
Grace!

28:22.849 --> 28:26.752
Oh, Annie! Hi!

28:26.819 --> 28:30.022
Hey, come here.
Here you go.

28:33.459 --> 28:35.894
Hey, you have more questions?

28:35.961 --> 28:40.264
Um...

28:40.332 --> 28:43.167
I'm not a reporter.

28:43.235 --> 28:46.137
- I'm CIA.
- Go away.

28:46.205 --> 28:48.073
Your father is continuing
to run an illicit spy ring

28:48.141 --> 28:49.641
from his prison cell.

28:49.709 --> 28:51.677
What?
How is that possible?

28:51.745 --> 28:53.479
Your sister is passing along
his chess moves

28:53.547 --> 28:54.914
to a foreign spy ring.

28:54.982 --> 28:57.718
- It's a sophisticated code.
- My sister?

28:59.254 --> 29:00.788
They're prison transcripts.

29:00.855 --> 29:05.259
Conversations between Bebe
and your father at the prison.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.995
Bebe's been visiting my dad?

29:11.232 --> 29:13.199
No.

29:13.267 --> 29:16.167
She hasn't visited him once.
They're fabricated.

29:16.235 --> 29:19.137
I was asked by my superiors
to trick you into believing

29:19.205 --> 29:21.339
that they were real so that
you would turn on your sister,

29:21.407 --> 29:24.176
but I wanted to be honest with
you so that you would help us.

29:24.243 --> 29:26.645
Well, the CIA has a funny way
of asking for help.

29:26.713 --> 29:28.180
We have operatives in danger.

29:28.247 --> 29:29.481
- Because of my father.
- Yes.

29:29.549 --> 29:31.150
I don't believe you.

29:33.319 --> 29:34.652
It's true.

29:36.722 --> 29:39.290
And I think deep down,
you know that.

29:39.358 --> 29:42.527
I wanna see him.

29:51.670 --> 29:54.205
Tell me everything.

29:54.272 --> 29:56.440
What have they told you?

29:56.508 --> 29:59.442
Now, if I've taught you
one thing in this world,

29:59.510 --> 30:03.379
it's that there is more
than one side to every story.

30:03.447 --> 30:04.948
I know.

30:05.016 --> 30:08.117
Yours, mine, and the truth.
Which is it?

30:08.185 --> 30:11.354
Just tell me
what they told you, honey.

30:11.422 --> 30:13.924
They told me people
have died.

30:13.992 --> 30:17.495
Trumped-up CIA dreck.

30:17.563 --> 30:20.232
Now, even if it were true,
it would only be bad people.

30:20.299 --> 30:23.402
It'd just be a few less pawns
on their chess board.

30:23.470 --> 30:25.671
I'm not six years old.

30:25.738 --> 30:27.706
I'm old enough to know
that nothing's good or bad,

30:27.774 --> 30:29.074
black or white.

30:29.142 --> 30:32.944
Well, the spy game
is only black.

30:33.012 --> 30:35.947
You're too good a person
to understand that, Gracie.

30:36.015 --> 30:37.315
And you're not?

30:37.383 --> 30:40.118
I'm a spy.

30:40.186 --> 30:43.521
I was recruited by the CIA
because I'm smart

30:43.589 --> 30:47.091
and cunning
and a fantastic liar.

30:50.629 --> 30:54.165
You involved Bebe.

30:54.233 --> 30:55.700
Your sister has always been
wary of me

30:55.768 --> 30:57.835
ever since she was
a little girl.

30:57.903 --> 30:59.270
I was gone so often.

30:59.338 --> 31:01.072
That's probably why
she resents me.

31:01.140 --> 31:02.774
So you put her at risk?

31:02.842 --> 31:05.076
Bebe is not gonna do anything

31:05.144 --> 31:07.646
that I or anybody else
asks her to do.

31:07.713 --> 31:09.381
She's gonna make
her own decisions.

31:09.448 --> 31:10.715
You know that.

31:10.783 --> 31:12.317
You're not telling me
anything.

31:12.385 --> 31:15.853
Consider the circumstances,
honey.

31:15.921 --> 31:20.925
Where we are.

31:20.993 --> 31:27.197
Did you use me
to pass along secrets?

31:27.265 --> 31:29.766
You don't have anything
to worry about, honey.

31:29.834 --> 31:31.735
That's your concern?

31:31.803 --> 31:35.772
What, my own daughter?
Of course.

31:35.839 --> 31:39.408
That was our game, Dad.

31:39.476 --> 31:41.410
For us.

31:41.478 --> 31:43.546
It was supposed to be sacred.

31:43.614 --> 31:48.451
I've spent the last...
15 years defending you.

31:48.519 --> 31:53.157
Calling you misunderstood,
telling people you were a hero.

31:53.225 --> 31:57.062
But everyone else was right.

31:57.129 --> 32:03.268
They all saw Max Langford.
I saw my father.

32:03.336 --> 32:07.872
And I'm a fool because of it.
Gracie.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.841
Grace?

32:11.877 --> 32:14.244
Grace, I know how hard
that must've been for you.

32:14.312 --> 32:15.646
Do you?

32:15.713 --> 32:18.215
How can you possibly know
how difficult that was?

32:18.282 --> 32:20.783
Why do you all say things
you don't mean?

32:20.851 --> 32:23.953
- That wasn't my intention--
- I am done.

32:24.021 --> 32:27.590
With this family, with the CIA,
with you, with all of this!

32:38.464 --> 32:39.798
Let me give you a ride home
at least.

32:39.866 --> 32:42.668
It's okay!

32:42.736 --> 32:44.103
You were right.

32:44.171 --> 32:46.706
I have no idea
what you're going through.

32:46.773 --> 32:49.109
My family,
we have plenty of issues,

32:49.176 --> 32:53.714
but compared to you...
I'm a lucky girl.

32:56.218 --> 32:58.052
Your father talks
about our assets

32:58.120 --> 32:59.988
like they are pawns
on a chessboard.

33:00.055 --> 33:03.691
Last week,
Yuri Trubachev was killed.

33:03.759 --> 33:06.494
Was he a good man?
I don't know.

33:06.562 --> 33:10.365
But he has a wife named Masha
who just beat breast cancer

33:10.433 --> 33:12.100
and a son named George

33:12.168 --> 33:16.805
who plays cello
for the Moscow Philharmonic.

33:16.872 --> 33:18.840
Your father says
the spy world's all black.

33:18.907 --> 33:20.274
I know you don't believe that

33:20.342 --> 33:22.710
because you can see
the good in people

33:22.778 --> 33:24.979
no matter what.

33:26.915 --> 33:29.616
I need your help.

33:29.684 --> 33:34.120
If I were to help you,
what would you need me to do?

33:34.188 --> 33:35.856
Just contact your sister.

33:35.923 --> 33:38.157
Tell her something is off
with your father.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.660
That he doesn't wanna
play chess anymore.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.897
Right. Bebe will act on that
intel and hopefully,

33:43.965 --> 33:46.467
that will lead us to the spy
she's in communication with.

33:46.534 --> 33:48.502
They are the ones
we're after ultimately.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.903
But after Bebe does that,

33:49.971 --> 33:51.672
you're gonna have her arrested,
aren't you?

33:51.740 --> 33:55.075
Grace...

33:55.143 --> 33:58.245
This is the right thing to do.

33:58.313 --> 34:00.213
As hard as it is,
I know you know that.

34:06.421 --> 34:07.854
Okay.

34:20.668 --> 34:22.534
Went to voicemail.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.038
Okay.

34:33.213 --> 34:35.982
- Still a recording.
- Leave a message.

34:36.049 --> 34:38.083
Hey, it's me again.

34:38.150 --> 34:39.918
Call me back
when you get this, okay?

34:39.985 --> 34:41.687
I know you don't care
as much as I do,

34:41.755 --> 34:44.657
but dad just seemed really off
when I saw him today.

34:44.725 --> 34:47.960
Argumentative and forgetful.

34:48.027 --> 34:50.663
Didn't even wanna continue
our chess game.

34:50.730 --> 34:54.900
He just said he forfeited,
like he's giving up hope...

34:54.967 --> 34:57.169
or something,
so call me, okay?

34:57.237 --> 35:00.840
And don't forget, I'm making
banana cream pie tonight.

35:00.908 --> 35:04.043
Your favorite in case you wanted
to come over for dinner.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.081
How was that?

35:09.149 --> 35:10.650
Fine.

35:10.717 --> 35:11.951
You did good.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.657
So what's next?

35:18.725 --> 35:20.625
Now we wait for your sister
to contact you.

35:20.693 --> 35:22.561
I'm gonna go look
after the horses.

35:22.628 --> 35:25.096
I forgot to feed 'em earlier.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.064
Keep an eye on the kettle,
okay?

35:26.131 --> 35:27.432
Sure.

35:40.480 --> 35:43.482
- What's your 20?
- We're back at the house.

35:43.550 --> 35:44.884
Any luck reaching Bebe?

35:44.952 --> 35:47.653
Not yet, do we have
any idea where she is?

35:47.721 --> 35:49.556
No.
I can tell you where she isn't.

35:49.624 --> 35:51.425
She <i>isn't</i> at her apartment.

35:51.492 --> 35:53.393
She's also not at the gift shop

35:53.461 --> 35:56.163
or within eyeshot of any
of our surveillance teams.

35:56.231 --> 36:00.067
I swear I might as well be out
there looking for her myself.

36:00.135 --> 36:01.368
Well, she's the daughter
of a spy.

36:01.436 --> 36:03.003
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

36:03.070 --> 36:05.738
- How's Grace holding up?
- I don't know.

36:05.806 --> 36:07.207
She says she wants
to cooperate with us,

36:07.274 --> 36:08.608
and I believe her,
but...

36:08.676 --> 36:10.176
When push comes to shove,

36:10.243 --> 36:11.710
I don't know if she's gonna
turn on her sister.

36:11.778 --> 36:14.213
Well, we don't really have
a backup plan here, Annie.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.248
I mean, we could pick Bebe up
and see if she'll talk.

36:16.315 --> 36:17.916
- But if she's smart--
- I know.

36:17.984 --> 36:19.218
We don't have anything hard
against her.

36:19.285 --> 36:20.819
And her Russian contacts'll
disappear.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.154
We have to try and force her

36:22.222 --> 36:23.756
to make contact
with her handlers again.

36:23.824 --> 36:25.324
I get it, I just--

36:25.392 --> 36:27.126
I don't know how easy
that's gonna be.

36:27.194 --> 36:29.729
Yeah,
well, we don't do easy.

36:29.797 --> 36:32.933
All right, your backup's
only ten minutes away.

36:33.001 --> 36:35.402
They're gonna setup perimeter
surveillance around the farm.

36:35.470 --> 36:37.204
Signal me if there's a problem.

37:05.497 --> 37:07.799
Bebe, you scared me.

37:07.866 --> 37:10.668
Your sister's out in the barn
with the horses.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.172
Let's dismiss
with the acting class, okay?

37:14.239 --> 37:17.342
Your phone, please?

37:18.811 --> 37:20.211
Stop.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.479
Toss it over. Slowly.

37:25.784 --> 37:27.151
Now your car keys.

37:27.219 --> 37:29.854
They're in my purse.

37:29.921 --> 37:32.489
Any firearms?
Weapons?

37:32.557 --> 37:34.225
Bebe, I don't know
what you mean.

37:34.292 --> 37:35.926
- Turn around!
- What?

37:35.994 --> 37:39.563
I said turn around!

37:39.631 --> 37:41.832
Put your arms up.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.168
My father always tried
to explain to me

37:44.236 --> 37:46.671
why you CIA types
didn't carry guns.

37:46.738 --> 37:48.139
Just doesn't make sense to me.

37:48.207 --> 37:49.641
I know your father
got you into this,

37:49.708 --> 37:50.942
but there is a way out.

37:51.010 --> 37:52.243
You don't have to go down
with him.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.480
What makes you think
this is his idea?

37:54.547 --> 37:56.982
Let's take a little walk.
Go.

37:57.050 --> 37:59.986
If you make any sudden moves,
I will end this right now.

38:07.473 --> 38:09.674
Bebe!
What are you doing?

38:09.742 --> 38:10.775
Move her car
into the stables.

38:10.843 --> 38:12.343
I want it out of sight.

38:12.411 --> 38:13.611
You were not supposed
to come here.

38:13.679 --> 38:14.712
Didn't you understand
my message?

38:14.780 --> 38:17.348
Of course I did!
Did she?

38:17.416 --> 38:19.350
I'm guessing it had something
to do with banana cream pie?

38:19.418 --> 38:21.586
Yeah, she knows
that I hate bananas,

38:21.653 --> 38:22.954
and I know
that she hates baking.

38:23.021 --> 38:24.522
You were supposed to get
out of town, Bebe,

38:24.589 --> 38:25.656
before it's too late!

38:25.724 --> 38:27.191
I'm not gonna
leave my sister behind.

38:27.259 --> 38:28.593
I have a plan.
We're getting out of here.

38:28.660 --> 38:29.794
- Move!
- What plan?

38:29.862 --> 38:31.396
What are you gonna do
with her?

38:31.464 --> 38:32.964
Just move the car, Grace!

38:33.032 --> 38:36.802
Keep walking.

38:36.870 --> 38:39.271
- The agency knows where I am.
- Move!

38:39.339 --> 38:40.939
I have backup on the way.

38:41.007 --> 38:44.276
Yeah, yeah.
CIA always has your back, right?

38:44.344 --> 38:46.345
Just like they had my father's?

38:46.413 --> 38:48.914
They destroyed this family!

38:48.981 --> 38:51.216
Bebe, think what this will do
to Grace.

38:51.284 --> 38:52.584
You don't wanna do this
to your sister.

38:52.651 --> 38:53.818
- Get back!
- I know you don't.

38:53.886 --> 38:55.453
Turn around!

38:55.521 --> 38:57.488
I can help you.

38:57.556 --> 38:59.857
It's not too late.
Believe me.

38:59.925 --> 39:02.026
Yeah, it is.

39:34.595 --> 39:35.929
Stop!

39:39.500 --> 39:43.737
Grace...

39:43.805 --> 39:46.406
This isn't you.
Maybe it is.

39:46.474 --> 39:48.575
Maybe I am just like the rest
of my family.

39:48.643 --> 39:51.544
You don't have to be.

39:51.612 --> 39:53.914
Grace, the second
you put down that gun,

39:53.982 --> 39:55.616
she's gonna have you arrested.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.653
You're gonna live your life
in prison just like dad.

39:58.721 --> 40:01.623
You haven't done
anything wrong yet.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.325
She's lying.

40:03.393 --> 40:05.361
She's been lying to you
since she met you.

40:05.428 --> 40:09.099
Why would you trust her on this?
What about you?

40:09.166 --> 40:11.534
You and dad have been lying
to me for years.

40:11.602 --> 40:14.037
We were protecting you.

40:14.105 --> 40:17.507
Grace, I know
how important family is.

40:17.575 --> 40:19.576
Especially
when it's all you have.

40:19.644 --> 40:22.445
But sometimes, you have to be
your own person.

40:22.513 --> 40:24.381
You have to make your own fate.

40:35.460 --> 40:38.329
Hey, has anyone seen
Barber or Hollman?

40:38.396 --> 40:39.463
They got reassigned.

40:39.531 --> 40:41.232
Reassigned? Where?

40:41.299 --> 40:42.833
Office of special projects.

40:45.637 --> 40:47.538
What the hell, Jai?

40:47.605 --> 40:48.906
When I said hire
a few good operatives,

40:48.974 --> 40:50.608
I didn't mean poach mine.

40:50.676 --> 40:53.211
I just made the offer.

40:53.278 --> 40:55.379
They're the ones
who accepted.

40:55.447 --> 40:57.114
Seems like your beef's
with them, not with me.

40:57.182 --> 40:58.816
Is that the kinda political
double speak

40:58.884 --> 41:01.552
that got you this promotion?

41:01.620 --> 41:04.455
Auggie, you were half right.
People matter.

41:04.523 --> 41:05.889
So does money.

41:05.957 --> 41:08.893
For Barber and Hollman,
this is where the money is.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.262
That's the last time
I give you advice.

41:12.330 --> 41:15.166
That's the last time
I'll need it.

41:18.437 --> 41:20.071
Bebe Langford's
in FBI custody.

41:20.138 --> 41:21.606
She's already talking.

41:21.673 --> 41:25.409
Max was using chess moves
as codes to transmit secrets

41:25.476 --> 41:28.178
which Bebe then sold
to an FSB handler.

41:28.246 --> 41:31.681
Bebe's given up the identity
and location of the handler.

41:31.749 --> 41:35.119
We've got a team who's
bringing him in now.

41:35.187 --> 41:37.355
Annie?

41:39.425 --> 41:41.093
Joan, I've been in situations
like that before,

41:41.161 --> 41:44.898
but yesterday,
I felt the bullet go by me.

41:44.965 --> 41:49.203
Decisions, reflexes, bravery--
none of that matters.

41:49.270 --> 41:51.104
I feel like
my luck's running out,

41:51.172 --> 41:53.173
so if I wanted specialized
weapons training--

41:53.241 --> 41:55.075
Consider it approved.

41:55.143 --> 41:57.578
You can report for shooter
and bodyguard training

41:57.645 --> 41:58.745
on Monday morning.

42:03.284 --> 42:04.518
Thanks.
