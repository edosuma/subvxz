00:05.072 --> 00:07.939
- To all my friends,

00:07.942 --> 00:10.676
peers and fellow students.

00:10.678 --> 00:15.681
I'm so honoured to
accept this crown

00:15.683 --> 00:18.117
as your prom queen.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.423
And I wish you all the
greatest success.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.560
Because if you really
want it, you can have it!

00:31.032 --> 00:33.132
Ugh!

<i>- Hi! You've reached
Joanne Harvey.</i>

01:33.894 --> 01:35.394
<i>Please leave me a message.</i>

01:35.396 --> 01:36.929
-<i> Joanne!</i>

01:36.931 --> 01:38.330
I just got your card,

01:38.332 --> 01:40.666
and you are a star
for remembering.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.802
Thank you so much. Call me.
Let's have dinner.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.793
- What do you think?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.428
- Very scholarly.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.762
- Really? I don't know.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.232
Maybe I should do
something with my hair.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.267
- Honey, I meant that
as a compliment.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.202
- It's just... I
wanna look good.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.404
I mean, everybody already
knows each other,

02:19.406 --> 02:22.074
and I'm gonna walk in at the
end of the school year.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.442
It's gonna be really weird.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.643
- It's gonna be great!

02:24.645 --> 02:26.812
Plus everyone's wearing
the same thing,

02:26.814 --> 02:28.280
so there's no judgement there.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.281
How about this?

02:29.283 --> 02:30.282
For your birthday,

02:30.284 --> 02:32.084
we'll go for a little
shopping spree.

02:32.086 --> 02:34.620
We'll get our hair done, our nails done.
Sound good?

02:34.622 --> 02:35.787
- Sounds great.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.557
- OK. Uh, strawberries?
Blueberries? Both?

02:38.559 --> 02:41.793
- Actually, Dad's taking me
to breakfast before class.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.428
- OK. You better get going then.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.997
- Yeah! One more thing.

02:44.999 --> 02:49.001
Could you maybe not make a
big deal about, you know,

02:49.003 --> 02:50.736
that I'm your daughter?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.404
- Of course.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.106
- You're the best!

03:07.988 --> 03:11.256
- Julie! Hi! Come on in.
- Thanks.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.759
- Have you settled
into your classroom?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.093
- Ah, that's my next stop.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.095
- Well, I know I've
said it before,

03:17.097 --> 03:19.831
but thank you for coming
in on such short notice.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.034
- I'm happy to help. I just...

03:22.036 --> 03:25.370
I wish it were under
different circumstances.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.372
- I understand you knew Joanne.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.840
- I do. We're good friends.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.310
- Well, I hope it won't
be too uncomfortable

03:31.312 --> 03:33.312
taking over her classroom.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.646
- It's a little strange,

03:34.648 --> 03:37.182
but I'm sure everyone's
feeling the same way.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.618
- You know, I worked
with Joanne for 6 years,

03:39.620 --> 03:42.221
and I never saw any sign
she would have done this.

03:42.223 --> 03:45.190
- Suicide is still
just a theory.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.625
- Of course.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.294
- How are the students
handling things?

03:49.296 --> 03:52.531
- There's been the usual
disruptions, questions.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.800
- Well, I'd love to
help in any way I can.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.835
In fact, I have an idea
for a "mindful box,"

03:56.837 --> 03:59.638
where students can express what
they're feeling anonymously.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.807
- Anything that might
help is welcome.

04:01.809 --> 04:02.808
- Great!

04:02.810 --> 04:04.409
- I'm sure I don't
need to tell you

04:04.411 --> 04:05.711
you have big shoes to fill.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.746
Joanne was strict,

04:07.748 --> 04:11.483
but teachers like her help
make Avondale one of the best.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.486
I hope you'll help us
maintain that reputation.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.321
- I will do my best.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.847
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

04:41.849 --> 04:45.384
- I heard they found a bottle
of Novaheel in Harvey's desk.

04:45.386 --> 04:48.287
- I'm not surprised.
That one had issues.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.789
- Yeah, like being an A1 bitch!

04:50.791 --> 04:53.692
- If everyone could
please take a seat,

04:53.694 --> 04:55.661
we can get started.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.874
Hi, everyone! I am Ms. Taylor.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.142
I'll be your math teacher

05:10.144 --> 05:12.044
for the remainder
of the school year.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.313
I apologize if I don't get
your names right away.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.415
It'll take me a minute,
but I will get there.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.718
I've got some good news for you.
We have a test tomorrow.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.589
- <i>Can I have your
attention, please?</i>

05:24.591 --> 05:27.726
<i>The student prom committee
is happy to announce</i>

05:27.728 --> 05:29.961
<i>this year's nominees for
prom king and queen.</i>

05:29.963 --> 05:33.098
<i>They are Tracy Pitch
and Brent Walker,</i>

05:33.100 --> 05:35.000
<i>Amy Turner and Dylan Wade...</i>

05:36.503 --> 05:39.604
<i>Heather Watts and Jack Lawson,</i>

05:39.606 --> 05:43.442
<i>and lastly, Sophie
Harris and Dave Emery.</i>

05:43.444 --> 05:44.976
What?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.313
- Well, I hope she
does something

05:48.315 --> 05:49.481
to her hair before prom.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.451
- Amy?

05:52.453 --> 05:54.653
Uh, based on your
reaction to the nominees,

05:54.655 --> 05:56.488
I'm assuming I got
your name right.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.989
- You got me.

05:57.991 --> 06:01.460
- Well, congratulations to
you and to all the nominees.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.628
- And welcome to you too, Ms.
Taylor,

06:03.630 --> 06:05.697
and your daughter.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.232
Miya, is it?

06:08.202 --> 06:09.768
- Thank you.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.837
Let's get to work, shall we?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.839
I want you to turn to page 7.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.650
- So, how was your first
morning at Avondale?

06:25.652 --> 06:27.052
- Fairly smooth!

06:27.054 --> 06:30.155
- Oh, good! I'm Aaron
Peters, 12th grade science.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.690
- Julie Taylor.
Nice to meet you.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.892
- How'd you get so lucky
to substitute here?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.894
- Oh, I'm not a
substitute, actually.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.397
I was on the tail end of a
leave when I got the call.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.065
- Oh, well, then welcome!
- Thanks!

06:40.067 --> 06:42.401
- I was just on my way to
the staffroom for lunch

06:42.403 --> 06:43.735
if you wanna meet everybody.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.970
- I'd love to, thank you.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.638
Uh, I'll be up in
a couple minutes.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.306
- All right.
- Thanks!

06:50.577 --> 06:54.045
- This one is even better.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.181
Sophie kind of looks like a dog.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.984
I'm gonna post this and
tag her as Prom Pooch.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.585
- Prom Pooch?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.121
Ah!

07:04.158 --> 07:05.490
Oh my gosh!

07:05.492 --> 07:08.460
<i>Hey, Avondale, what up?</i>

07:08.462 --> 07:12.130

starting a new school or what?

07:32.619 --> 07:33.952
- Uh, kind of.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.055
- Why don't you come sit
with me and my friends?

07:37.057 --> 07:40.659
I'll make sure it doesn't
suck nearly as bad.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.738
- You know, I thought
he'd at least

07:53.740 --> 07:55.173
congratulate me or something.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.708
But no, he had to point out

07:56.710 --> 07:59.211
that I dropped the ball
and failed everyone,

07:59.213 --> 08:01.480
even though I haven't had
a drink in over a year.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.715
- You've gotta stop using
that word, "fail."

08:03.717 --> 08:04.816
- That's what I did.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.551
I screwed up my
marriage, my job.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.553
I almost lost custody
of my daughter.

08:08.555 --> 08:13.558
- Julie, your mom died, and
you went off the rails.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.862
As your sponsor, I can vouch
that we've all done it.

08:16.864 --> 08:20.065
But look at you now.
You're good!

08:20.067 --> 08:21.366
- I'm not gonna lie.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.935
It's... it's not easy
stepping in for Jo.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.571
I mean, I still can't
believe she...

08:26.573 --> 08:31.042
she walked out of that school
and did what they say she did.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.110
- From what I read,

08:32.111 --> 08:33.845
the evidence is
pretty compelling

08:33.847 --> 08:35.847
that she did commit suicide.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.048
- It looks like that,

08:37.049 --> 08:39.551
but I won't believe it
till they find her.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.885
Jo was tough as nails.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.188
In college, if she didn't
agree with a professor,

08:43.190 --> 08:46.124
she would outright challenge
them and not back down.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.694
- Hey, if you're
struggling at any time,

08:49.696 --> 08:51.396
you can call me, all right?

08:51.398 --> 08:54.799
- I'm pretty sure I dump
on you every chance I get.

08:54.801 --> 08:55.967
- That's true.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.043
- Hey!
- Hey!

09:05.045 --> 09:06.811
- How was your first day?

09:06.813 --> 09:09.147
- Actually, a lot
better than I thought.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.549
- Yeah? How so?

09:10.551 --> 09:13.051
- Well, you know Amy
Turner in your math class?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.152
- Yes.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.154
- Well, she asked if I could

09:16.156 --> 09:18.723
come sit with her and some
of her friends at lunch.

09:18.725 --> 09:19.891
And they are so cool!

09:19.893 --> 09:21.059
- The cool kids, huh?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.727
- Mom, don't worry.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.931
They are nothing like the girls
at Crescent, especially Amy.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.000
I mean, yes, she's popular, but
she's actually really nice.

09:29.002 --> 09:32.270
- Well, just keep your head
up and your eyes open,

09:32.272 --> 09:35.206
'cause you know how those
girls can be, right?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.776
You hungry? Indian!

09:37.778 --> 09:39.477
Sparkling water sound good?

09:39.479 --> 09:40.845
- Yeah!
- Awesome.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.169
- I'll do that!

10:04.171 --> 10:05.904
- Thanks!

10:07.374 --> 10:09.307
I gotta get to work.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.248
<i>Hey!</i>

10:50.250 --> 10:54.185
- Hey. I can't believe
Sophie Harris was nominated.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.354
<i>- She has a lot of friends, Amy.</i>

10:56.356 --> 10:58.423
- Yeah, losers!

10:58.425 --> 11:01.493
<i>- Well, there's, like, this
trend of choosing underdogs,</i>

11:01.495 --> 11:02.861
<i>like all those celebs</i>

11:02.863 --> 11:05.397
<i>who agree to go with total
geeks to their proms.</i>

11:05.399 --> 11:08.099
- Whatever. There is no
way she's gonna win.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.936
And Heather and Tracy, like,
they're not even in the running.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.673
Look, I gotta go. I'll
talk to you later.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.306
- Wow! Didn't realize
Joanne had so many haters.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.609
- Well, they'll realize
eventually the toughest teachers

11:51.611 --> 11:53.044
are often the best ones.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.287
- Do you seriously think you
have a chance at winning?

12:02.289 --> 12:03.955
- If I don't, then
why do you care?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.724
- Maybe I'm trying
to do you a favour

12:05.726 --> 12:07.592
so you don't look
like a loser at prom.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.461
Either way, you better drop out.

12:09.463 --> 12:13.231
That crown's not gonna look very
good if you don't have any hair!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.532
- Girls!

12:15.669 --> 12:17.402
Is there a problem?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.037
- I've gotta get to class.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.441
- You know, I don't know why
she doesn't take my advice

12:23.443 --> 12:25.744
and style her hair
in an updo for prom.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.112
It would look amazing!

12:27.114 --> 12:29.781
- So, that's what this was
about, hairstyling tips?

12:29.783 --> 12:33.184
Because from where I stood,
it didn't look so innocent.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.419
- Really?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.788
Well, I can tell you,
anyone at this school

12:36.790 --> 12:40.592
would die to have Amy Turner
give them beauty advice.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.260
- And why is that?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.129
- Because I'm just that popular.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.798
Your daughter's really
lucky to be my friend.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.601
- I think you should
probably head to class.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.738
Oh, and, Amy...

12:54.708 --> 12:56.608
I'm watching you.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.288
Eyes on your test, please.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.027
- <i>Sorry for the interruption.</i>

13:16.029 --> 13:18.329
<i>Just a brief announcement
that Sophie Harris</i>

13:18.331 --> 13:20.965
<i>has withdrawn her name as
nominee for prom queen.</i>

13:20.967 --> 13:24.669
<i>Ballots will be accepted
until the end of next week</i>

13:24.671 --> 13:26.070
<i>for a new nomination.</i>

13:26.072 --> 13:28.306
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:30.310 --> 13:31.676
All right, time's up!

13:31.678 --> 13:33.678
Everyone, have a great weekend!

13:33.680 --> 13:38.183
Reminder: Chapter 12, Questions
1 through 8 are due on Monday.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.884
Thank you!

13:41.855 --> 13:43.321
- Hey!

13:47.227 --> 13:49.627
- Thank you. Thank you!

13:51.598 --> 13:53.364
Sophie, you have a minute?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.233
What happened?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.735
Why did you remove your
name from the nominee list?

13:57.737 --> 13:59.270
- It's just not worth it.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.605
- What do you mean?

14:00.607 --> 14:02.006
- To go up against Amy.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.409
- Well, everyone has a
chance at winning, Sophie.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.410
- You don't get it.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.845
I just wanna finish school

14:06.847 --> 14:08.479
and not have to deal with her.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.764
- I just rescued this from
being used as a football.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.332
- Thank you.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.768
- You know, the staff
should have one of those,

15:03.770 --> 15:05.503
so we can bitch
about how this job

15:05.505 --> 15:07.405
can suck the life
right out of you.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.606
- So you've lost optimism

15:08.608 --> 15:10.642
that we're making the
world a better place

15:10.644 --> 15:11.676
one student at a time?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.311
- Have you met some
of these kids?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.445
- I have!

15:14.447 --> 15:16.281
Actually, there's
one in particular

15:16.283 --> 15:18.516
who strikes me as a
bit of a life-sucker.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.351
- Oh, let me guess. Amy Turner?

15:20.353 --> 15:21.986
- So she has a reputation.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.821
- Oh yeah! Amy's one of a kind.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.658
She's smart, and she knows
how to get under your skin.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.860
So, if I were you, I'd
stay out of her way,

15:28.862 --> 15:31.029
or your time here at
Avondale may be over

15:31.031 --> 15:33.064
before it's even begun.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.829
Hey, Mom!

16:04.831 --> 16:07.398
- Hey! You wanna go out
for dinner tonight?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.234
- Actually, Amy invited
me to hang out with her

16:10.236 --> 16:11.669
and some of her friends.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.971
- Oh, OK!

16:12.973 --> 16:16.307
- So can we skip dinner
tonight, if that's OK?

16:16.309 --> 16:18.042
- We'll be ordering pizza.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.844
- Sure.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.779
- All right! Great!
I'm gonna go change.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.150
- So, where are you two planning
on hanging out tonight?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.385
- Uh, at my boyfriend's.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.054
Don't worry, his
parents are fine

16:30.056 --> 16:33.391
with having people over
when they're away.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.327
Where's Mr. Taylor?
Working late?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.763
- Miya's father and
I are separated.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.399
- My dad's not around either.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.001
- Mark's around.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.104
- Whatever keeps the
support cheques coming.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.840
My mom and I didn't
get that luxury.

16:48.842 --> 16:52.343
- So, how are you adjusting
with the changes at the school?

16:52.345 --> 16:56.280
- If you're talking about Harvey
killing herself, it's too bad.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.682
But I'm fine with it,

16:57.684 --> 17:00.785
because, to be honest,
no one really liked her.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.855
- I'm asking because I
just graded your test,

17:03.857 --> 17:07.191
and the results are
less than spectacular.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.627
- So? There's only a few
weeks of school left.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.063
No big deal, right?

17:12.065 --> 17:15.233
- Well, it is a big deal.
I'm your teacher.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.369
- Does it make your
job more fulfilling

17:19.372 --> 17:21.039
if your students like you?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.942
- No. Teaching isn't a
popularity contest.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.545
- But it would make
things easier.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.314
Like for Joanne,

17:30.316 --> 17:32.784
if she hadn't tried to
play by all the rules.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.152
But she didn't get that

17:34.154 --> 17:36.888
that's not how things
are run at our school.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.389
- How are things run?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.626
- You'll figure it out.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.829
Wow, you look hot!

17:44.831 --> 17:47.265
- Thanks! So, I'll see you?

17:47.267 --> 17:49.067
- Have fun. Home
by midnight, OK?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.401
- OK.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.438
- I wonder if Sara's
gonna be there.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.242
You know she got asked out
by this guy in college.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.677
- How do you just, like,

17:59.679 --> 18:02.013
walk out your door one day
and jump into a river?

18:02.015 --> 18:04.348
- They don't know if that's
exactly what she did.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.750
- What else could've happened?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.618
- I don't know. They
don't have a body.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.354
- I heard the last person
who saw her was Mr. Peters.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.723
- Oh, so you think he has
something to do with it?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.058
- It is weird.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.028
- Maybe he's always wanted
to dissect a cadaver.

18:17.030 --> 18:20.264
- Or maybe he's, like, a
closet serial killer.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.533
- Who?
- Mr. Peters.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.769
We're thinking he has Ms.
Harvey's body

18:24.771 --> 18:26.404
stashed in formaldehyde
somewhere.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.805
- Oh my God!

18:27.807 --> 18:30.041
Will you guys please stop
talking about Harvey?

18:30.043 --> 18:31.776
My phone is literally blowing up

18:31.778 --> 18:33.711
since I posted about
Dylan's party.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.946
Tonight's gonna be lit.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.915
- I knew her, actually.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.884
She was my mom's friend.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.153
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.088
- So, what, was she depressed?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.656
- My mom says she wasn't.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.126
She doesn't believe
she killed herself.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.260
- See?

18:49.262 --> 18:51.229
- What does she think happened?

18:51.231 --> 18:54.298
- I don't know. I think she
just hopes she's still alive.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.567
- Well, not me, 'cause
then she'll dock me

18:56.569 --> 18:58.336
for handing in my
assignment late.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.338
- That's messed up.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.639
- Let's go get a drink.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.940
- Don't say that!

19:02.942 --> 19:04.609
- Oh my God! You
know I'm kidding.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.944
- It's gotta be, like,
bad karma or something.

19:06.946 --> 19:11.349
- Dylan's dad is cool as long,
as we don't drink all his beer.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.285
- I probably shouldn't. My mom
has a real thing about drinking.

19:14.287 --> 19:17.255
- Yeah, so does mine,
but I don't care.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.023
- No, my mom would
totally freak out

19:19.025 --> 19:20.691
if she found out
I'd been drinking.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.694
- Are you saying our new
teacher's a real hard-ass?

19:23.696 --> 19:27.131
- No! No! It's just... It's
just her thing, you know.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.935
She used to drink, and she's
just really not cool about it.

19:30.937 --> 19:34.372
- Is that why you have an
AA card on your fridge?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.941
- You know, it's fine, actually.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.442
I don't care either.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.147
- Hey!

19:44.150 --> 19:45.816
- Hey!

19:45.818 --> 19:48.619
- How about we go, uh,
celebrate that nomination?

19:49.989 --> 19:52.623
- You would literally find
any reason to celebrate.

doing it for the first time

- How'd you get home?

22:13.199 --> 22:16.667
- I Ubered. Amy has
a later curfew.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.904
- So, what did you
guys do tonight?

22:20.873 --> 22:22.440
- Just hung out.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.142
- Any drinking?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.277
- No, of course not.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.713
- You know, if you did,
you could tell me.

22:28.715 --> 22:32.149
I'd rather you talk to me about
that kind of thing than not, OK?

22:32.151 --> 22:34.618
- I'm not into all
that, all right, Mom?

22:36.189 --> 22:37.655
- What about Amy?

22:37.657 --> 22:39.290
- She's fine.

22:39.292 --> 22:41.459
- Does she drink?

22:42.962 --> 22:45.830
- Even if she does, doesn't
mean that I would.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.799
So, what about you and Dad?

22:48.801 --> 22:52.203
Do you think now you might
try and work things out?

22:54.006 --> 22:57.641
- I think your dad and I need...

22:58.911 --> 23:00.644
time and space right now.

23:00.646 --> 23:04.648
But we both love you so much,
and we are always here for you.

23:06.352 --> 23:09.220
- You know, Amy told me that
her dad actually left her

23:09.222 --> 23:11.021
when she was only a year old.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.690
She hasn't seen him since.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.792
- That might explain her edge.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.862
- What do you mean?

23:17.864 --> 23:20.931
- Amy reminds me of some of the
girls that went to Crescent.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.166
- Are you serious?

23:22.168 --> 23:23.901
- Yes, I'm serious.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.839
- Mom, she took me in.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.543
I was the totally new girl.
She didn't have to do that.

23:32.545 --> 23:35.713
- Miya, would it bother you

23:35.715 --> 23:38.749
if you saw her being
mean to people?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.219
- You know...

23:43.556 --> 23:46.357
not everyone's gonna
be nice to everybody.

23:46.359 --> 23:49.193
But at least this
time, it's not me.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.996
You know what? No.
I'm going to bed.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.772
- What are you doing home?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.441
- They let me go early

24:03.443 --> 24:06.944
so they can schedule me
for a double tomorrow.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.946
It's past 2:00, Amy.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.283
I thought we had an agreement
you're home by 1:00.

24:12.285 --> 24:15.486
- What do you care? You're
literally never here.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.487
- I care a lot.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.922
And just because I'm working,

24:17.924 --> 24:19.723
doesn't mean you
don't get a curfew.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.628
I'm talking to you!

24:26.232 --> 24:29.400
- Give me that.

24:29.402 --> 24:31.402
- Ah!

24:35.741 --> 24:37.908
Ah!

24:50.957 --> 24:53.457
- <i>Just follow the
yellow brick road!</i>

25:01.100 --> 25:04.301
<i>Amy Turner, will you
go to prom with me?</i>

25:04.303 --> 25:05.936
-<i> Yes!</i>

25:09.375 --> 25:11.308
<i>- Amy Turner, will you
go to prom with me?</i>

25:11.310 --> 25:12.343
-<i> Yes!</i>

25:13.980 --> 25:16.380
<i>- Amy Turner, will you
go to prom with me?</i>

25:16.382 --> 25:17.448
-<i> Yes!</i>

25:18.818 --> 25:20.484
<i>- will you go to prom with me?</i>

25:20.486 --> 25:21.685
-<i> Yes!</i>

25:21.687 --> 25:23.621
<i>- will you go to prom with me?</i>

25:23.623 --> 25:24.655
-<i> Yes!</i>

25:46.579 --> 25:48.045
- Dad just called.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.614
Asked if he could take me out
tomorrow for my birthday.

25:50.616 --> 25:51.882
- Of course!

25:51.884 --> 25:54.218
And seeing as how you are
officially 18 today,

25:54.220 --> 25:57.054
where would you like to go for
your birthday shopping spree?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.089
- Somewhere I can find
a dress for prom.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.292
- So you're going?
- Yeah!

26:01.294 --> 26:03.594
Actually, last night, Amy
convinced me I should.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.629
I don't have a date,
but it doesn't matter.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.431
I can just go with
Amy and her friends.

26:07.433 --> 26:10.701
- It's a special night.
I'm glad you're going.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.403
Let's go buy that dress.

26:12.405 --> 26:13.405
- OK!

26:14.407 --> 26:15.573
- Who's that?

26:15.575 --> 26:17.308
- I asked Amy if she
could come along.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.609
I didn't think you'd mind.

26:19.879 --> 26:22.780
- Hey, Mi! Mrs. T!

26:22.782 --> 26:26.684
You girls ready to go shopping?
I know the perfect place.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.395
Oh my God!

26:39.398 --> 26:40.898
This is it!

26:40.900 --> 26:43.200
This is my dream dress!

26:46.305 --> 26:47.571
What do you think?

26:48.574 --> 26:49.907
Fit for a queen?

26:49.909 --> 26:51.475
- It's gorgeous!

26:51.477 --> 26:53.978
- Oh, you should get this one!
It's perfect!

26:53.980 --> 26:55.179
- I don't know.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.114
They're a little pricy,
don't you think?

26:57.116 --> 26:58.115
- That's OK!

26:58.117 --> 26:59.483
My mom gave me her debit card

26:59.485 --> 27:01.518
and told me to get
whatever dress I wanted.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.654
I mean, it is the biggest
night of your life.

27:03.656 --> 27:06.457
- I doubt it'll be the
biggest night of your life.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.492
- Are you kidding?

27:08.494 --> 27:11.195
Everything that we have
worked for for 18 years

27:11.197 --> 27:12.863
has brought us to that night.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.299
And who you are on
prom will define you

27:15.301 --> 27:16.800
for the rest of your life.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.348
- Mom, can I please
get this dress?

27:31.350 --> 27:34.451
- I think we need
to shop around.

27:41.160 --> 27:45.629
- ♪♪ Happy birthday, dear Miya ♪

27:45.631 --> 27:50.067
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪

27:51.303 --> 27:52.936
- Make a wish!

27:57.243 --> 28:00.744
- I bet I can guess
what you wished for!

28:00.746 --> 28:02.312
A date for prom.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.882
Oh, by the way, I spoke
to the committee.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.718
I got you the job of counting
the votes on prom night.

28:07.720 --> 28:11.355
- Really? That's so cool!
Thanks!

28:11.357 --> 28:12.556
- To Miya.

28:12.558 --> 28:15.225
You are officially an adult,

28:15.227 --> 28:17.361
but you'll always
be my baby girl.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.699
- Shouldn't we be toasting
with some champagne?

28:21.701 --> 28:24.068
I mean, 18 is kind
of a big deal.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.670
- Ah, it is, but it's not 21.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.173
- Well, you could have a glass.

28:31.777 --> 28:35.412
I'm sorry, I forgot.
- Forgot what?

28:35.414 --> 28:39.083
- That you're a recovering.
- I am.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.452
In fact, I am proud to say
I haven't had a drink

28:41.454 --> 28:42.953
in over a year
now, right, honey?

28:42.955 --> 28:45.089
- I'm gonna go grab
us some sodas.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.290
- OK.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.928
- I hope I didn't make
you uncomfortable.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.196
- Not at all.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.465
In fact, I'm glad
we have a minute

28:54.467 --> 28:56.366
because I wanted to ask you:

28:56.368 --> 28:59.036
Are you aware that
you're failing math?

28:59.038 --> 29:01.805
- Yeah, but I'll just
make it up after grad.

29:01.807 --> 29:04.775
- Sure, but the rules at
Avondale are pretty clear.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.910
You have to pass all
of your subjects

29:06.912 --> 29:08.912
in order to attend prom.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.749
And you said yourself, Ms.
Harvey played by the rules,

29:11.751 --> 29:14.451
so I'm... I'm sure she
informed you of that.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.620
- She was gonna
give me a chance...

29:17.990 --> 29:20.624
to take a few extra tests.

29:20.626 --> 29:22.559
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.029
Will you give me that?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.767
- I... I can arrange
for another test.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.369
- Great.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.640
Happy birthday, Mi!

29:38.077 --> 29:41.445
- Honey, I'm so sorry we
didn't get you a dress today.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.080
- It's fine.

29:46.952 --> 29:50.954
- So, how did Amy know
about my drinking?

29:50.956 --> 29:53.290
- Mom, you have an AA
card on the fridge.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.860
- Did she talk to you about it?

29:56.862 --> 29:58.428
- No. Of course not.

29:58.430 --> 30:02.833
Well, I've got some homework
I should probably get done,

30:02.835 --> 30:04.735
so I'm gonna go do that.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.939
Thanks for the cake.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.440
- You're welcome, honey.

30:30.196 --> 30:33.630
- My debit card was missing
from my purse today.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.099
- I needed a prom dress, Mom.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.836
You knew that.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.144
- Amy, we can't afford this!

30:47.146 --> 30:48.912
You're gonna have
to take it back,

30:48.914 --> 30:50.681
and we can buy you another one.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.584
- Where? Some crappy
consignment store?

30:53.586 --> 30:56.587
Oh, or the outlet mall? Ugh!

30:56.589 --> 30:58.355
God! I mean, look at this!

30:58.357 --> 31:00.891
Cheap! Cheap! Ugly! Cheap!

31:00.893 --> 31:04.161
Do you really expect me
to wear this acrylic rag?

31:04.163 --> 31:05.429
Think about it!

31:05.431 --> 31:07.865
How would this have
made me look, Mom?

31:07.867 --> 31:10.434
Like a loser, and I
am not a loser, Mom,

31:10.436 --> 31:13.704
no thanks to you and all
these cheap, ugly clothes

31:13.706 --> 31:16.006
that you bought me for years.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.609
And now, on the biggest
night of my life,

31:18.611 --> 31:20.611
you want me to wear what?

31:20.613 --> 31:22.079
What?

31:22.081 --> 31:26.216
Some hand-me-down dress
from prom 3 years ago?

31:26.218 --> 31:29.553
- I've worked so hard to
give you the best I could,

31:29.555 --> 31:31.021
including tuition.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.524
- Well, maybe you should have
worked harder! Look at you!

31:34.526 --> 31:38.295
Is it so hard to pull
yourself together?

31:38.297 --> 31:41.098
Everyone knows that in
order to be the best,

31:41.100 --> 31:42.966
you have to look the best.

31:42.968 --> 31:46.236
So, it's no wonder we live
paycheque to paycheque.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.708
Not me. I'm not gonna
live like that.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.444
I'm gonna be the queen.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.922
- Vicky, do you have a minute?

32:04.924 --> 32:06.657
- Of course! What is it?

32:06.659 --> 32:10.160
- I'm wondering if anyone
has ever filed a complaint

32:10.162 --> 32:11.795
against Amy Turner.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.297
- Not that I'm aware.

32:13.299 --> 32:16.433
- Not just teachers,
but students.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.601
- Of course not.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.037
And I'm sure if there
were any issues,

32:20.039 --> 32:21.438
they were dealt with,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.507
since we strongly
encourage our teachers

32:23.509 --> 32:25.008
to handle things internally.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.611
I'm sure you can understand why.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.614
- Of course. Thank you.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.987
- So, the rumour's
getting around

32:36.989 --> 32:38.789
that you're as tough
as Joanne was.

32:38.791 --> 32:41.525
- Really? I will take that
as a compliment, thank you.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.893
- And what about Amy Turner?

32:42.895 --> 32:44.962
You taking my advice,
steering clear?

32:44.964 --> 32:46.229
- I'm actually surprised

32:46.231 --> 32:48.165
no one's filed a
complaint against her.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.167
- Well, no one likes to admit

32:50.169 --> 32:52.002
when they can't manage
a student, Julie.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.370
- So, what do you do?

32:53.372 --> 32:54.738
- Look the other way.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.007
Or you do like Carol
Saunders did:

32:57.009 --> 32:59.009
You take a leave.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.544
- She left because of Amy?

33:00.546 --> 33:03.547
- Well, she never said it,
but that would be my guess.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.315
How's Amy behaving
in your class?

33:05.317 --> 33:08.418
- She's failing, but I'm giving
her a chance to raise her grade.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.487
- Well, make it easy.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.022
- I'll make it fair.

33:12.024 --> 33:15.192
Hey, do you know where I might
be able to find Ms. Saunders?

33:15.194 --> 33:16.693
- In the teacher directory.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.663
If not, I'm sure Deb, the
secretary, could help you.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.797
- Thanks!

33:38.250 --> 33:41.284
Hi! Uh, are you Carol Saunders?

33:41.286 --> 33:42.953
- Yes. Can I help you?

33:42.955 --> 33:44.454
- I'm Julie Taylor.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.857
I'm Avondale's new math teacher.

33:46.859 --> 33:49.526
I was wondering if you
could give me some insight

33:49.528 --> 33:51.795
into a former student
of yours, Amy Turner.

33:51.797 --> 33:54.431
I hear you may have had
some trouble with her.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.600
- Who did you hear that from?

33:56.602 --> 33:58.301
- Mr. Peters.

33:58.303 --> 34:02.272
- Ah! So, he's still playing
along with her, is he?

34:02.274 --> 34:04.808
Well, that's one way
to hang onto your job.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.277
- I was under the impression
you took a leave.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.545
- That's right.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.047
I left before she
could have me fired,

34:11.050 --> 34:14.217
because no job is worth
that kind of harassment.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.485
- What exactly did she do?

34:16.487 --> 34:18.822
- Shouldn't I be
asking you that?

34:18.824 --> 34:21.391
That's why you're
here, aren't you?

34:22.895 --> 34:26.329
- Yeah, she may be
playing some games.

34:26.331 --> 34:30.067
- Then take my advice
and be very careful,

34:30.069 --> 34:33.270
because that girl
is a sociopath,

34:33.272 --> 34:35.772
and she plays to win.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.141
- You really believe
she's a sociopath?

34:38.143 --> 34:40.476
- Aside from almost
having me fired,

34:40.478 --> 34:42.344
she made sure my marriage ended!

34:42.347 --> 34:43.847
And now, if you'll excuse me,

34:43.849 --> 34:45.782
I... I've got an
appointment to get to.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.251
- Why... why... why
would she do that?

34:48.253 --> 34:53.255
- Because Amy will stop at
nothing to get what she wants.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.454
(Birds chirpin-Wake up.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.059
It's dinnertime, Joanne.

36:49.942 --> 36:52.142
That's a good girl.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.255
Mr. Peters?

37:40.158 --> 37:42.726
I need to take
another math test.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.462
- And what does that
have to do with me?

37:45.464 --> 37:49.733
- Well, I was hoping that you
could get me a copy of the test

37:49.735 --> 37:51.568
that I can use to study,

37:51.570 --> 37:54.337
and I won't tell
anyone about that time

37:54.339 --> 37:56.673
that you put your
hand up my skirt.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.508
- Well, that never happened.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.509
- Didn't it?

37:59.511 --> 38:01.511
Because I'm sure that the board

38:01.513 --> 38:03.747
could easily be
convinced otherwise.

38:03.749 --> 38:07.284
And I know that you wanna just
finish out the school year

38:07.286 --> 38:08.718
with a good reputation.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.193
- Miya, your father's here!

38:18.897 --> 38:20.764
Hey! You wanna come in?

38:20.766 --> 38:24.467
- Actually, uh, I was hoping
to have a word. Outside?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.269
- OK.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.640
What is it?

38:30.642 --> 38:33.710
- I got a call late last
night from your sponsor.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.345
She said you had a relapse.

38:36.581 --> 38:38.515
- That's impossible.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.917
That's not true!

38:40.919 --> 38:42.986
- Look, I know you've
had a hard time

38:42.988 --> 38:44.988
with this whole Joanne thing,

38:44.990 --> 38:47.490
but the only reason
you won joint custody

38:47.492 --> 38:49.159
was because you were sober.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.660
But that all can change.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.496
- Mark, I haven't had a
drink in almost 13 months.

38:53.498 --> 38:57.400
Kate knows that! She wouldn't
say anything differently.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.736
Call her! Call my
sponsor, Mark, please!

38:59.738 --> 39:01.004
- What's going on?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.972
- Your father thinks
I've been drinking.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.575
- Dad, she hasn't. Trust
me, I know she hasn't.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.745
- We should go. I only get a few
hours with my birthday girl.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.314
- Mark, I am telling
you the truth!

39:20.158 --> 39:21.324
-<i> Hello!</i>

39:21.326 --> 39:23.426
- Kate, it's Julie.
- <i>Hey!</i>

39:23.428 --> 39:24.861
- What's going on?

39:24.863 --> 39:26.796
-<i> What? What do you mean?</i>

39:26.798 --> 39:28.865
- Uh, Mark said you
left him a message

39:28.867 --> 39:30.633
saying I've been drinking again.

39:30.635 --> 39:35.171
- What? Why would I do that?
I've never called Mark.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.540
- Well, why would he
just make that up?

39:37.542 --> 39:40.510
- Julie, I didn't
call your ex-husband.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.379
<i>For one, I don't
have his number.</i>

39:42.381 --> 39:44.881
<i>And secondly, I know you
haven't been drinking.</i>

39:44.883 --> 39:46.783
So it wasn't me.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.685
- OK.

39:54.359 --> 39:56.693
- She thinks.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.028
She thinks she's
doing me a favour.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.597
But she doesn't get it!

40:00.599 --> 40:04.100
You don't threaten me, Ms.
Taylor!

40:04.102 --> 40:07.604
I think we all know how
that's gonna end, Joanne.

40:07.606 --> 40:10.373
I don't want your friend
to end up like you.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.512
Do it.

40:18.683 --> 40:22.152
Do it! And make sure
you show your work.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.163
You know, no adult has
ever been in here...

40:35.100 --> 40:36.900
not even my mom.

40:38.703 --> 40:41.738
Because you were only
allowed in if I said so.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.675
Not that I had any friends.

40:48.213 --> 40:52.649
They made fun of
me for my clothes,

40:52.651 --> 40:55.051
for my $10 haircut.

40:57.055 --> 41:01.691
And Meg Dyer, she was the worst.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.129
That fat bitch!

41:08.133 --> 41:09.732
So, one day,

41:09.734 --> 41:12.836
I told her that I had all this
Halloween candy to give her,

41:12.838 --> 41:14.904
and I brought her back here.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.345
But there was no candy.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.917
After that...

41:29.488 --> 41:31.654
she never bullied me again.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.892
No one ever did.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.297
- Hmm...

41:49.007 --> 41:51.374
- What are you gonna do, Joanne?

41:51.376 --> 41:52.842
Stab me with it?

41:52.844 --> 41:56.412
It's gonna take a lot more
than a pencil to hurt me.

42:12.898 --> 42:16.032
You might actually
prove to be useful.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.440
- Julie, can I talk to you?

42:25.577 --> 42:27.644
It'll just take a second.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.048
- What is it?

42:32.050 --> 42:34.517
- Well, I wanted to get
your opinion on something

42:34.519 --> 42:36.252
before I meet with
a student of mine.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.720
- Couldn't this wait?

42:37.722 --> 42:40.723
- Sure, but I... I... I was
worried I was gonna miss you,

42:40.725 --> 42:43.259
um, and I'm gonna meet
him just before lunch.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.995
- OK, well, I'll make sure
to find you before lunch.

42:59.244 --> 43:02.545
- Vote for Amy Turner
and Dylan Wade

43:02.547 --> 43:05.848
for this year's prom
king and queen!

43:05.850 --> 43:07.951
And in case anyone has forgotten

43:07.953 --> 43:11.621
how we have represented the
school for the last 4 years,

43:11.623 --> 43:13.356
here's a little cheat sheet

43:13.358 --> 43:17.226
to remind you of why we deserve
to be your prom king and queen.

43:17.228 --> 43:19.095
- Does it have "stud" on there?

43:19.097 --> 43:20.229
- Shut up!

43:20.231 --> 43:22.265
- Seriously, we're
Avondale royalty!

43:41.920 --> 43:44.787
- So, what did you wanna
talk to me about?

43:44.789 --> 43:46.122
- It's Amy's marks.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.725
Based on the grade she
received from Ms. Harvey

43:48.727 --> 43:50.259
and the test she just retook,

43:50.261 --> 43:52.061
it looks like she's
failing math.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.730
- Really? I'm surprised.

43:53.732 --> 43:56.332
Amy's marks have
always been so good.

43:56.334 --> 43:59.936
- Well, it doesn't look like
this is working out for her.

43:59.938 --> 44:02.705
And if she doesn't pass,
she won't graduate.

44:03.842 --> 44:06.776
- I wasn't aware of any of this.

44:06.778 --> 44:10.246
- Ms. Harvey never spoke
with you about Amy's grades?

44:10.248 --> 44:12.915
- She called, and we were
planning on meeting,

44:12.917 --> 44:16.085
but then a few days later,
I heard she disappeared.

44:19.691 --> 44:21.491
Amy, sweetie!

44:21.493 --> 44:24.594
Your teacher dropped by
to discuss your marks.

44:26.131 --> 44:29.065
- You failed your test again.

44:34.039 --> 44:36.105
- That's not possible.

44:37.142 --> 44:38.941
- I have it right here.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.647
- I'm sure that there's a way

44:44.649 --> 44:47.150
that she could retake
it again, right?

44:47.152 --> 44:49.819
- Actually, I was already
stretching the rules

44:49.821 --> 44:51.521
by giving her another chance.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.623
- What about the
final assignment?

44:53.625 --> 44:55.058
That's worth 20%, right?

44:55.060 --> 44:57.293
- It is, but you'd
have to score a 98%

44:57.295 --> 44:59.328
to bring your grade
just above a pass.

44:59.330 --> 45:00.363
- I'll do it.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.331
- I appreciate the intent,

45:02.333 --> 45:05.468
but I think we need to be
realistic based on your year.

45:05.470 --> 45:08.137
- You don't know me well
enough to assume anything.

45:08.139 --> 45:11.574
- OK, I'm sure that Amy will
do whatever she has to do

45:11.576 --> 45:13.009
to bring up her mark.

45:13.011 --> 45:14.877
- I'm sure she will.

45:16.715 --> 45:18.581
Thank you for your time, Elaine.

45:18.583 --> 45:21.718
You have my cell if you need
to discuss anything further.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.286
Thank you.

45:32.497 --> 45:34.230
- Why didn't you do something?

45:34.232 --> 45:36.032
- What did you expect me to do?

45:36.034 --> 45:39.335
- Oh my God! That bitch is
trying to ruin everything!

45:39.337 --> 45:43.272
- Amy! Where are you going?

45:55.386 --> 45:58.554
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?

45:58.556 --> 46:00.757
- You got your test back.

46:02.293 --> 46:05.895
- Do you see where
you are right now?

46:05.897 --> 46:08.564
You don't get to play
teacher anymore!

46:08.566 --> 46:12.235
If you don't help me pass,
I swear I will kill you.

46:12.237 --> 46:15.104
- Wasn't that your plan anyhow?

46:15.106 --> 46:17.039
Or do you have a plan?

47:29.781 --> 47:31.480
I mean, she's only
been at school

47:31.482 --> 47:33.449
for what, like, 2 weeks?

47:33.451 --> 47:34.984
- Whatever, I'm not worried.

47:34.986 --> 47:38.120
- Do you imagine how much it
would suck if she were your mom?

47:38.122 --> 47:40.356
- Well, maybe Miya gets
perks because of it.

47:40.358 --> 47:41.824
- I don't think she bends.

47:41.826 --> 47:44.193
- Hey!
- Hey.

47:44.195 --> 47:47.430
- What were you
guys talking about?

47:47.432 --> 47:50.633
- How cool it would be if
your mom was your teacher.

47:50.635 --> 47:53.169
I mean, there's no way that
you could fail, right?

47:53.171 --> 47:56.005
- My mom wouldn't
give me a free pass.

47:56.007 --> 47:58.841
- Well, that sucks. We'll
talk to you later.

48:03.147 --> 48:04.947
- You OK?

48:04.949 --> 48:06.682
- Yeah, I'm fine.

48:06.684 --> 48:08.451
- Do you wanna hang
out after school

48:08.453 --> 48:09.785
and go over some prom stuff?

48:09.787 --> 48:11.120
- Sure.

48:11.122 --> 48:12.655
- Can we do it at your place?

48:12.657 --> 48:15.558
My mom's working nights, and
she hates to be woken up.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.159
- Yeah, no problem!

48:17.161 --> 48:20.263
- Cool! I'll see you
after school then.

48:35.046 --> 48:36.812
- What are you doing?

48:36.814 --> 48:40.750
- My dress is in desperate need
of some extra bling for prom.

48:40.752 --> 48:43.619
I thought maybe your mom
would have something.

48:44.822 --> 48:46.522
Come on! We're just trying it.

48:46.524 --> 48:48.090
We'll put it back.

48:48.092 --> 48:52.528
- OK. My mom does have a few
things my dad gave her.

48:53.531 --> 48:55.965
Let's see...

48:57.435 --> 49:01.237
- Do you have a dress yet?
- Uh, no, not yet.

49:06.945 --> 49:09.745
You should wear your
hair up for prom.

49:09.747 --> 49:12.415
It would look amazing.

49:14.218 --> 49:16.352
- What about these?

49:16.354 --> 49:18.654
- Ah, yes! They're perfect.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.093
Oh, I dropped one.

49:25.263 --> 49:26.929
I can't see where it went.

49:26.931 --> 49:28.030
- Really?

49:29.434 --> 49:31.200
- Maybe it went under the bed.

49:36.474 --> 49:37.606
- Did you find it?

49:39.711 --> 49:41.177
- Yeah.

49:43.448 --> 49:46.082
- You look like you saw a ghost.

49:46.084 --> 49:49.085
- Hey, let's just
put these back.

50:52.950 --> 50:55.918
I thought about it,
and you deserve this.

50:57.321 --> 50:59.522
What's wrong? What is going on?

50:59.524 --> 51:01.957
- Found this beside your bed.

51:01.959 --> 51:05.327
- Miya, this isn't mine.
- Don't lie to me!

51:05.329 --> 51:07.863
- It's... it's not!
- Then where did it come from?

51:07.865 --> 51:09.965
You're the only one in
the house who drinks.

51:09.967 --> 51:11.500
- I don't drink, Miya!

51:11.502 --> 51:14.203
- Bull! I backed you with
Dad, and you were lying!

51:14.205 --> 51:16.705
So how am I supposed
to talk to you now

51:16.707 --> 51:18.707
if you weren't even
honest with me?

51:18.709 --> 51:20.176
- Miya, please...
- No! No.

51:20.178 --> 51:21.877
- Please.
- No! You know what?

51:21.879 --> 51:24.547
You said this was gonna be a
fresh start for both of us,

51:24.549 --> 51:26.382
and I was finally
starting to feel good.

51:26.384 --> 51:29.185
I mean, what would I have
said if Amy found this?

51:29.187 --> 51:30.252
- Amy was here?

51:30.254 --> 51:31.554
- We were planning prom!

51:31.556 --> 51:32.855
- Were you in my room?

51:32.857 --> 51:34.390
- What does that have to do...

51:34.392 --> 51:36.058
- Were you in my room?

51:36.060 --> 51:37.426
- Why are you yelling at me?

51:37.428 --> 51:39.728
- I don't trust her! I
don't trust that girl!

51:39.730 --> 51:41.430
- Seriously? You're blaming Amy?

51:41.432 --> 51:42.865
- Miya, I am not the only one.

51:42.867 --> 51:45.000
Teachers have left the
school because of her.

51:45.002 --> 51:47.503
- I don't believe you!

51:49.006 --> 51:52.842
- You know I don't drink.
You know I don't!

51:52.844 --> 51:54.176
Where are you going?

51:54.178 --> 51:55.511
- I'm going to Dad's.

51:55.513 --> 51:57.179
Don't worry, I won't
tell him why.

51:57.181 --> 51:58.948
I won't as long as
you don't stop me.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.549
- Miya!

52:53.271 --> 52:54.803
- Amy...

52:54.805 --> 52:57.573
- Not right now, Mom. I'm
gonna be late for school.

53:02.079 --> 53:04.413
- <i>Good morning, Avondale!</i>

53:04.415 --> 53:05.948
<i>With prom just 3 days away,</i>

53:05.950 --> 53:08.450
<i>members, don't miss
the committee meeting</i>

53:08.452 --> 53:11.020
<i>today during lunch
in the library.</i>

53:11.022 --> 53:13.856
- We should rent
a limo for prom.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.858
- A white one with a sun roof.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.526
- Ooh!

53:17.528 --> 53:19.128
- You know, I've been thinking,

53:19.130 --> 53:22.164
isn't it kind of cramping our
style hanging out with Miya?

53:22.166 --> 53:24.934
She's nice or whatever, but
her mom is such a bitch!

53:24.936 --> 53:26.202
- To you, she is.

53:26.204 --> 53:29.471
- Well, Miya has done
nothing to back me.

53:29.473 --> 53:33.676
- So, should we get a
stretch or a stacked SUV?

53:33.678 --> 53:36.679
- You guys thinking of
renting a limo for prom?

53:36.681 --> 53:40.115
- Of course!
- Cool! I'd be into that!

53:40.117 --> 53:43.185
- Don't you have to be
there early or something

53:43.187 --> 53:44.853
for committee?

53:44.855 --> 53:47.489
Maybe you could just
go on your own.

53:48.526 --> 53:49.858
- Ah!

54:04.976 --> 54:08.544
- How dare you try to manipulate
my daughter and my life!

54:08.546 --> 54:11.313
- Honestly, I don't what
you are on about now.

54:11.315 --> 54:15.484
- I know you ended Ms. Saunders'
marriage and pushed her out.

54:15.486 --> 54:17.386
I am not going anywhere!

54:18.923 --> 54:22.024
- That's fine. I
like a challenge.

54:22.026 --> 54:23.892
And you know what they say!

54:23.894 --> 54:27.162
Every hurdle you knock over
just makes you stronger.

54:27.164 --> 54:29.665
- It's every hurdle
you overcome, Amy.

54:29.667 --> 54:33.902
You are not as smart as you
lie and cheat and pretend...

54:33.904 --> 54:35.371
- Actually, I am.

54:35.373 --> 54:38.207
'Cause if you look at the
assignment I'm handing in,

54:38.209 --> 54:39.775
you'll see that it's perfect,

54:39.777 --> 54:42.411
which raises my grade
just over a pass.

54:42.413 --> 54:44.413
So go ahead.

54:45.683 --> 54:48.617
Stick around! I've won!

54:48.619 --> 54:51.553
There's nothing more
that you can do.

55:19.116 --> 55:20.249
Psst!

55:46.577 --> 55:48.410
- Miya. Miya!

56:54.078 --> 56:56.078
- What are you doing?

56:56.080 --> 56:58.180
- Just collecting laundry.

56:58.182 --> 56:59.381
- I can do it.

56:59.383 --> 57:01.650
- You're gonna wanna put
stain spray on that.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.385
What happened? Did
you cut yourself?

57:03.387 --> 57:04.553
- At school.

57:04.555 --> 57:06.588
- Well, here, let me
take a look at it!

57:06.590 --> 57:09.358
- It's fine! God, just
go play nurse at work!

57:57.808 --> 57:59.641
- You looking for these?

57:59.643 --> 58:02.277
You've become a lot
of things, Amy,

58:02.279 --> 58:04.780
but I didn't think
you'd turn to this.

58:04.782 --> 58:06.615
- I'm not a pill popper, Mom.

58:06.617 --> 58:08.617
- Then where have they gone?

58:08.619 --> 58:11.920
- I don't know. Maybe you took
them and you don't even know it?

58:11.922 --> 58:14.423
I see you popping them
like candy with your wine.

58:14.425 --> 58:16.225
- That's not true. You know it.

58:16.227 --> 58:20.095
- Isn't it? Whose name
is on the bottle, Mom?

58:20.097 --> 58:22.831
Why? Why do you even take them?

58:22.833 --> 58:24.132
- This isn't about me.

58:24.134 --> 58:26.635
- Of course it is, because
if I were taking them,

58:26.637 --> 58:27.936
whose fault would that be?

58:27.938 --> 58:29.605
Who brought them
into this house?

58:29.607 --> 58:31.006
- You're turning this around!

58:31.008 --> 58:34.076
- Yeah, because you won't
answer the question.

58:34.078 --> 58:35.744
Why? Why do you take them?

58:35.746 --> 58:38.614
Is it because your
job is too stressful

58:38.616 --> 58:40.482
or because Dad left us?

58:40.484 --> 58:42.251
Or maybe it's all those things,

58:42.253 --> 58:44.253
because your sad,
pathetic, little life

58:44.255 --> 58:46.021
didn't turn out the
way you planned,

58:46.023 --> 58:47.589
working 12-hour shifts

58:47.591 --> 58:50.526
with no one to come home to but
your bottle and your pills.

58:50.528 --> 58:52.661
- It's you, all right?

58:53.764 --> 58:56.298
I take them because of you.

58:57.768 --> 59:01.770
- Well, in a couple of
months, I'll be gone,

59:01.772 --> 59:04.740
and then you can have
them all to yourself.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.573
Are you following me?

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:14.409
- I did say I was watching you.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:21.550
- You have no idea the
mistake that you just made.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.953
- Tell me something, Amy.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:29.825
Why do your handwritten
numbers match Joanne's?

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.896
- Are you serious?

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:36.365
- Very.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.535
- You're crazier
than your friend.

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:41.737
- I don't think so.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.739
In fact, I think the
detective on the case

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.240
will call this evidence.

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:48.644
- And I'm pretty sure that he
would call this harassment.

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:51.480
Following a student,
accusing them of nothing?

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:54.816
- You know, you can spin
this however you want, Amy,

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.985
but I haven't done
anything wrong.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.789
I'm out on a walk, and I
happened to run into you.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:04.459
- Oh. OK, so, I'm not here.

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:06.128
I'm at home.

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:09.131
What's that?

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:10.966
My teacher's at my door.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:14.269
She's accusing me of
having something to do

01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:16.471
with her daughter moving out.

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:21.343
She's really angry, and I'm
pretty sure she's drunk.

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:22.644
I'm just guessing,

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:24.846
but maybe she fell off the wagon

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.149
because of her dear
friend Joanne.

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:30.986
And when I try to
get her to leave,

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.721
she lashes out...

01:01:34.091 --> 01:01:35.657
and she hits me.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:38.226
- Great story.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.796
No one will believe it.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.197
- You don't think so?

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.665
- I don't think so.

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:51.440
- Ah!

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:58.013
No, don't!

01:01:58.015 --> 01:01:59.781
- Amy, stop it!

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:03.852
What the hell?

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:08.356
- Ms. Taylor, please!

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:37.486
- I know how uncomfortable
this must be for you, Amy.

01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:40.355
And I'm sure Ms. Taylor
appreciates your understanding

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:41.823
as much as I do.

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:44.259
- Vicky, with all due
respect, this didn't happen.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.694
None of it.

01:02:45.696 --> 01:02:48.597
In my whole life, I have never
laid my hand on anyone,

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:49.598
let alone a student.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.899
I mean, to even suggest...

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:53.201
- Ms. Taylor, Amy has
been generous enough

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:56.004
for not filing a
formal complaint.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.073
Her request that you be
dismissed immediately

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.074
is not uncalled for.

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:00.509
- Please.

01:03:01.678 --> 01:03:02.844
Elaine...

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:05.447
We all know our children.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.582
And that's our
responsibility as parents

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:10.051
is to know our children.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.922
And you let her get
away with this,

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:17.759
you're letting her get away
with a pretty big lie.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.429
I... I... I wanted
to talk to her.

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:22.864
I saw her...

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:25.801
I saw her walk behind the
house and into the woods,

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:27.269
and I followed her.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:28.537
- Can we please go now?

01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:30.305
- Of course.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.642
- She left this stuck to
my door with a knife.

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:35.877
- You saw her do this?
- I didn't see her. I...

01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:38.747
I know it was her, because she's
been doing stuff like this.

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:40.949
She's been bullying me
since I started this job,

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:41.950
and I... I won't cave!

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:44.219
- Julie, that's enough!

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.987
On behalf of the entire school,

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.956
you have our sincerest apologies

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.258
and assurance this
will be dealt with.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.936
What the hell was that about?

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:03.271
- You don't get it! She's crazy!

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:06.408
I mean, she... Vicky, you gotta
believe me, she did this.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.910
She did this. She did
that to her face.

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:11.513
- So, what? An 18-year-old
was bullying you?

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:12.948
- She's manipulative.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.450
I mean, she knows what to
do to get what she wants.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:17.452
I mean, you can ask
Mr. Peters, ask Carol.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.653
- I don't have to, Julie.

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.789
There's never been a
complaint against her.

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:22.524
- No one wants to
lose their job!

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.292
- OK, we're done here.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.065
And, Julie, get some help.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.256
- Amy!

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:45.674
- Hi!

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:47.175
- Hi!

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:48.610
I'm sorry. Uh, did you call?

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.145
Because my phone didn't ring.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:53.448
- No, um, I have Miya's prom dress.
Is she home?

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:56.017
- Yeah, she just got
back from school.

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:57.953
Um, come on in.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:02.657
Miya!

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.337
- Hey!

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.871
- Hey.

01:06:16.873 --> 01:06:19.474
- What are you doing here?

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:20.976
- I brought your prom dress.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:23.545
You don't have to wear it,
but I know you love it,

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:25.380
and I wanted you to
have the option.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:28.216
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:31.152
- How about I, uh, put that
up in your room for you?

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.620
Thanks.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.372
I wanted to let you know

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:53.408
that it didn't... Didn't
work out at school.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.111
But I figure that gives us a...
a chance

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:58.179
for a fresh start
somewhere else, right?

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.581
- Another fresh start.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.883
- I know you don't have a
lot of faith in me now,

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:04.519
but don't believe
everything you hear.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.354
- What are you talking about?

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.256
- You know me, Miya.

01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:10.425
Please don't forget that, OK?

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.228
And I love you.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:17.032
So I want you to have a
great time at prom tonight,

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:19.601
and stay away from Amy.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.439
Have fun.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:55.970
- Mom!

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.241
Mom!

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:05.847
Mom!

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:10.185
Can you zip me up, please?

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:17.258
- I saw you...

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:20.528
going into the woods.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.531
What were you doing?

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:27.035
- I'm 18, Mother.

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:31.473
I don't have to tell you
everything I'm doing.

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:34.109
- As long as you live
in my house, you do.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:36.478
- Fine!

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.013
I went to meet Dylan for
a little pre-prom sex

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:41.416
because I figured he'd
be too drunk after.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.353
Are you glad you asked?

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:51.024
- You know, most
mothers are proud

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:54.028
when their daughters are
about to graduate...

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:58.032
proud of the women
they've become.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:04.872
- Well, then you should
be glowing, Mother.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.176
- I'm not.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:13.113
You don't even deserve
to go to prom.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.553
- I don't care what you think!

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:22.023
This is my night!

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:26.728
I'm gonna be the queen.

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:10.738
- Oh my gosh! That
limo was so sick!

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.740
- Enjoy prom!
- Oh, you too!

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:14.375
- Thanks. See you later.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.544
- OK, guys, let's tag
this moment in history.

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.951
- Hey.

01:10:23.954 --> 01:10:26.988
- Hey. Nice dress!

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.624
Was that the one on
the discount rack?

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:32.994
- You have to vote
before you go in.

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:34.462
- I'd love to.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:41.269
Is it bad luck to
vote for ourselves?

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:43.871
- Politicians do
it all the time.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.081
- Come on, guys.
The party awaits.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.058
- Hello?

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.961
I'll be right there.

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.570
- Come in.

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:18.940
- Has Amy gone to prom?

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:21.276
- Yeah, she left a
short while ago.

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.944
- Um...

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:26.748
I, uh, I really need you
to take my word on this.

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:31.886
I would never, ever
strike your daughter.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:32.987
- I know.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.493
- Where did Amy go?

01:11:38.495 --> 01:11:41.663
- Probably to practice
her victory speech.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:44.165
- Did you vote for her?

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:45.400
- Of course!

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:48.236
Why, didn't you?

01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:49.537
- No.

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:52.273
- For real?

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:55.176
Oh my gosh! If Amy finds out,
she is going to kill you!

01:11:55.178 --> 01:11:56.844
- Seriously, Sara?

01:11:56.846 --> 01:11:59.781
She's just a bitch,
not a psycho.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:06.988
- Ladies!

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:09.590
Hey!

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:14.529
Oh, sweetie, your
makeup looks like crap.

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:17.265
You should probably go fix it.

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:23.004
So?

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:27.041
Did I win?

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:30.912
- You'll have to wait and see.

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:40.121
- I knew you were useless.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:41.723
- What are you doing?

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:43.491
- You don't get it, Miya.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:46.227
You made a mistake
counting the votes.

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:47.328
- No, I didn't.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:50.298
- You're only here
because of me!

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.767
- Don't touch me, you bitch!

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:56.304
What the hell?

01:13:00.343 --> 01:13:01.776
- You're pathetic!

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.117
- My mom was right about you!

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:10.618
- What, you mean that drunk

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.787
that you left to go
live with your dad?

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:15.423
All because of a cheap bottle
of Chardonnay by the bed?

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:18.626
You know, it's too bad
it wasn't a better year.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:20.762
I might've actually enjoyed it.

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:24.031
- You're not getting that crown!
Ow!

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:27.502
- Don't mess with me, Miya.

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:31.639
I will break you, the same
way that I did your mother.

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:41.816
- That doll you found
on your door...

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:46.120
Amy had one just like it.

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.022
I should have spoken up.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:53.027
It's just I haven't been able to
mother Amy in such a long time.

01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:01.302
She looks down on me, you know?

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:03.004
She thinks I'm a failure.

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:06.174
She should, 'cause you're right.

01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:08.976
I should have raised a child

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:11.512
who's respectful and kind.

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:18.686
Amy's none of those things.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.689
Not anymore.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.395
You, um, you said you followed
her that night into the woods.

01:14:27.397 --> 01:14:29.230
- Yes, I did.

01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:31.999
- I saw her too.

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:34.702
She slipped through
the back fence.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:39.373
- What do you think
she's doing back there?

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:49.684
- This used to be
Amy's clubhouse.

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:52.453
- Why would she still
be coming out here?

01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:54.021
- I don't know.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.993
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have brought you here.

01:15:01.364 --> 01:15:02.864
- Do you hear that?

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:05.032
- It's probably an animal.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:31.759
- It's nailed shut!

01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:50.311
- Oh my God!
- Joanne!

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:51.812
- Oh my God!

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:55.249
- Elaine, help me get her out!

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.755
Let's get you out of here.

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.159
Are you hurt?

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.727
- No.

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:09.564
- Oh!

01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:14.468
- What happened? Who
did this to you?

01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:17.338
- Amy Turner.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.006
- Why?

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:21.208
- I told her she
wouldn't go to the prom.

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:24.979
- Oh my God! That's why she
had Miya count the votes!

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.114
If Amy doesn't win...

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:31.719
Miya, please pick up.

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:33.287
Call the police.

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:35.990
- <i>Hi! This is Miya.</i>

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.325
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:39.460
- OK. I'm... I'm
going to the school.

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:41.729
Tell the police to
meet me there, OK?

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:44.131
- <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:47.868
- I need to report my daughter.

01:17:32.215 --> 01:17:35.316
- Hello? Can anyone hear me?

01:17:36.386 --> 01:17:38.619
