00:51.384 --> 00:52.552
<i>The sounds of Gongjin.</i>

01:06.357 --> 01:08.068
-Thank you.
-It was delicious.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.694
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.130
-Taekwon!
-One.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.965
-Taekwondo!
-Taekwondo!

01:52.237 --> 01:55.156
Ms. Yoon Hye-jin! A package for you!

01:57.575 --> 02:00.745
<i>This is the sound
of Ms. Yoon Hye-jin, who's from Seoul,</i>

02:00.829 --> 02:02.956
<i>rushing out to receive a package.</i>

02:19.180 --> 02:20.014
Take it.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.224
Right.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.517
EPISODE 3

02:22.600 --> 02:24.185
You work on Saturdays too?

02:24.686 --> 02:28.064
Yes. Jin-seok broke his arm,
so I'm covering for him for a while.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.024
That's not very good news.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.903
-Don't I need to sign it?
-No, your face is your signature.

02:35.071 --> 02:38.283
I mean, a face like yours
is rare here in Gongjin.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.827
-Did you diss me?
-Depends on you.

02:40.910 --> 02:44.539
Look who's talking.
Do you think you're good-looking?

02:44.622 --> 02:48.251
In Seoul, a face like yours is more common
than gum spat on the ground.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.586
Okay. Bye.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.965
It's more common than the squid
brought into the harbor this morning.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.098
"Hi."

03:04.976 --> 03:06.561
-What do you think?
-Not bad.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.190
"Not bad" isn't good enough
for armor I'll wear into a battlefield.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.735
-Isn't it a fellow dentist's wedding?
-It is.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.321
But everyone will be there.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.615
They'll talk about
how I opened a clinic here

03:18.698 --> 03:20.283
and turn me into a laughingstock.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.328
It's going to be a bloody battle.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.873
You dentists are so pathetic.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.918
And I'm going to be
the least pathetic one among them.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.754
Why don't you go shopping
at a department store then?

03:33.463 --> 03:34.839
I wish I could.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.509
But the boondocks
have no department stores.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.928
You're right about that.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.601
There's only one way for me to survive.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.104
Ms. Yoon!

03:50.188 --> 03:51.022
Ms. Yoon!

03:52.315 --> 03:53.524
-How's this?
-It's pretty!

03:53.608 --> 03:56.194
-It's a bit boring, right?
-Ms… Ms. Yoon.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.946
Ms… Ms. Yoon.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.117
What do you think?

04:03.201 --> 04:04.661
A bit too much, right?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.121
-Like an awards show outfit?
-Yes.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.666
Ms. Yoon.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.085
Ms. Yoon!

04:12.168 --> 04:14.587
<i>Ms. Yoon</i>

04:14.671 --> 04:19.801
<i>Ms. Yoon</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:21.511
Too much?

04:22.762 --> 04:23.763
-This is hard.
-Very.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.014
Ms. Pyo Mi-seon…

04:26.557 --> 04:27.809
This is yours, right?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.395
I don't look rich enough, do I?

04:30.478 --> 04:32.230
-You do.
-Do I?

04:32.313 --> 04:34.232
-Yes.
-Something's missing.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.942
Ms. Yoon!

04:37.277 --> 04:38.403
What are you doing?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.863
Why do you order so much?

04:40.947 --> 04:42.490
There's quite a bit today. Sorry.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.659
Come on. Seriously.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.996
You order from all over the world.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.331
The US, Germany, England…

04:50.415 --> 04:52.166
They're from everywhere.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.670
I just bought some clothes. That's all.
And it's none of your business.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.755
Why do you need so many clothes?

04:58.423 --> 05:01.467
A fashion terrorist like you
would never understand.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.012
It's all about functionality.
You don't know anything.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.930
Good for you.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.266
Are you splurging
since you have patients now?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.310
How will you save up money to go to Seoul?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.270
I'm going this Sunday, okay?

05:12.353 --> 05:13.563
-This Sunday?
-Yes.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.565
For a very important reason.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.359
And these are the last ones
for a while, so quit nagging.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.555
Look at that color.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.766
It brightens your complexion.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.975
-Really?
-Yes.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.644
-Do I look okay?
-You look gorgeous.

05:54.145 --> 05:54.979
Turn around.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.530
It's perfect. Into the battlefield!

06:07.116 --> 06:09.035
-I'll get going.
-Okay, see you.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.329
Make sure you feed the hedgehog.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.288
Okay.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.380
They would've been perfect for this look.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.340
I'm sorry.

06:22.423 --> 06:26.511
Due to my carelessness, your other half
is probably floating in the open sea.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.526
God, I barely recognize you.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.152
Look who's talking.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.824
I'm not expecting any packages today.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.576
-I know. I have a favor to ask of you.
-What is it?

06:55.748 --> 06:57.458
I heard you're going to Seoul today.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.586
-Let's go together.
-What?

07:01.170 --> 07:02.630
They all need to go to Seoul.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.550
Ms. Gam-ri needs to give
marinated crab to her son.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.552
Ms. Mat-i… What a beautiful hat.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.263
Her friend's grandson
is having his first birthday.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.723
Ms. Suk-ja's daughter
hurt her back and asked her

07:12.807 --> 07:14.559
to take care of her children.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.146
-We can go.
-We need to talk.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.274
You can't do this all of a sudden.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.900
So it's okay, right?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.321
Let's go.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.535
-Okay.
-Let's go.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.538
It's okay, right? Go on. She'll drive us.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.789
Unbelievable.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.879
Here.

07:46.424 --> 07:50.553
Right. Is the lid shut tight?

07:50.636 --> 07:53.055
Yes, it is. Don't you worry about a thing.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.517
-New car?
-That's not important.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.186
What are you doing?

07:58.269 --> 08:00.563
Shouldn't we hurry?
We need to make several stops.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.690
We'll talk later.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.927
Why did you pack so much?

08:31.010 --> 08:32.553
This isn't a lot.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.806
I'm actually worried
that it may not be enough for all of us.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.352
You made potato cakes?
These are my favorite.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.686
If you want

08:41.437 --> 08:44.190
to avoid carsickness,
you need to keep chewing.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.858
Dr. Yoon, have one.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.736
I'm good. I'm driving, so…

08:50.404 --> 08:53.074
-What are you doing?
-Don't talk with your mouth full.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.163
Ms. Gam-ri, why aren't you eating?

08:59.247 --> 09:02.875
I had a big breakfast, so I'm still full.

09:02.959 --> 09:06.462
Just have one. She made it for us.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.096
What's wrong?

09:15.179 --> 09:16.806
They're undercooked.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.016
Why is it so hard?

09:19.100 --> 09:23.229
Don't blame me.
You're the one who has fragile teeth.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.939
Just spit it out already.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.775
Do you have weak teeth?
You should've told me sooner.

09:27.858 --> 09:31.237
Gam-ri, ask her
to give you a nice discount.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.657
Shut it. Stop spewing nonsense.

09:34.740 --> 09:39.120
Ms. Kim, you should
come to my clinic. I'll treat you well.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.044
-Gosh!
-Oh, dear!

09:58.848 --> 10:01.225
-Goodness gracious.
-Are you okay?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.477
I could've gotten a heart attack.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.147
I can't believe what just happened.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.150
We should really have
such a reckless driver's license revoked.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.403
Why are you chasing him?

10:12.486 --> 10:15.740
He should know what he did wrong.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.160
Don't do it. Don't be like him.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.088
Hey.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.674
-How could you drive so recklessly?
-Unbelievable.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.677
-You could've caused an accident!
-What?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.888
You can't change lanes without signaling.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.058
-We didn't crash, so it's all good.
-What did you say?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.727
No harm done, so what's the problem?

10:46.270 --> 10:50.274
Don't drive so recklessly,
or you're bound to cause an accident.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.817
Don't cause any harm to others.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.655
Blah, blah. God, you're making
such a big deal out of nothing.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.157
This is why
they should forbid women from driving.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.075
What did you say?

10:59.158 --> 11:01.327
-Hey, watch your words.
-Gosh…

11:01.410 --> 11:04.997
God damn it. What the hell
is that bastard babbling about?

11:05.498 --> 11:10.294
You bastard. How dare you run your mouth
like that after what you've done?

11:10.795 --> 11:12.713
You son of a bitch.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.882
I ought to rip out your lungs and kidneys

11:14.965 --> 11:17.802
and jump rope with your intestines!

11:17.885 --> 11:19.345
Are you crazy, old hag?

11:19.428 --> 11:20.471
I am, you bastard!

11:20.554 --> 11:23.557
-You worthless, little bastard!
-Damn it.

11:23.641 --> 11:28.396
You little bastard, where are you going?
Come back here, you asshole!

11:28.479 --> 11:32.733
What an asshole.
How dare he run his mouth?

11:38.072 --> 11:41.200
You see, my mom was from Beolgyo.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.995
-Right.
-I see.

11:45.079 --> 11:45.913
Right.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.290
What should we do?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.877
The potato cakes are all over the floor.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.005
-Dear. What a waste.
-There are wet wipes in there.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.590
In here?

12:12.940 --> 12:15.651
Do you seriously have
an appetite after what you've done?

12:15.734 --> 12:18.571
Of course. Roasted potatoes
are the best at rest areas.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.406
No, <i>soddeok-soddeok</i> are.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.283
-Want one?
-No thanks.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.327
What's taking them so long?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.496
I'm going to be late.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.956
We have plenty of time.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.667
Why are you in a hurry? Take it easy.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.461
Appreciate the view too.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.421
Whatever.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.382
Want me to buy you a <i>soddeok-soddeok</i>?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.386
This way.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.559
-Where are they going?
-Where are they going?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.895
What are they doing?

12:59.528 --> 13:00.863
This is so annoying.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.157
So much.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.410
-Suk-ja is good at dancing.
-Let's go, Suk-ja!

13:08.454 --> 13:09.455
All right!

13:10.164 --> 13:11.957
-This is nice!
-Doing great!

13:12.041 --> 13:15.836
I'm really sorry,
but could I turn off the music?

13:15.920 --> 13:16.754
What?

13:16.837 --> 13:20.174
I prefer driving quietly.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.762
Turn it off.
We shouldn't bother the driver.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.430
You're such a party pooper.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.140
You be quiet too.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.853
Where are you from?

13:32.937 --> 13:36.065
I was born in Seoul
and raised in Gyeonggi Province.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.358
Goodness. Same here.

13:37.441 --> 13:41.028
I got married and moved to Gongjin
from Yangpyeong at the age of 22.

13:41.612 --> 13:44.532
Which Yoon family do you belong to?

13:44.615 --> 13:46.575
The Haenam Yoon clan, ma'am.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.995
So is my daughter-in-law.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.207
Then who's your earliest ancestor?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.502
Earliest ancestor?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.420
I'm not too sure.

13:58.504 --> 14:03.217
They say there's no future
for those who don't know their history.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.012
You should at least know that much.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.389
I'm sorry.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.183
What do your parents do?

14:11.725 --> 14:14.687
Well, my dad has retired.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.230
And my mom passed away.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.359
Why did you have to ask her that?

14:20.442 --> 14:23.571
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.866
It's okay. I don't remember much anyway

14:26.949 --> 14:28.534
since I was so little.

14:30.911 --> 14:35.833
Dr. Yoon, is there a restroom nearby?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.084
A restroom?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.254
It'll take some time.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.339
Is it urgent?

14:43.424 --> 14:46.385
Old people need to go
to the bathroom often.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.763
-Be quiet.
-Our bladders became weak.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.474
Aging is inconvenient in many ways.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.602
-Gam-ri!
-Hang in there.

You should've gone with her.

-Be quiet.
-Please exit safely.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.682
-Unbelievable.
-Be quiet.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.562
-Goodness.
-You're just unbelievable.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.523
-You have to go again?
-Darn it.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.195
-Goodness.
-We'll wait here.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.404
-Hey.
-I ate too much.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.864
-Go together.
-I need to poop.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.033
-We're halfway there.
-Be careful.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.874
What's taking them so long?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.542
They just went in.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.637
<i>Grandma, have a safe trip!</i>

16:19.853 --> 16:23.482
I thought you'd give me hell
the moment they left. Why are you quiet?

16:23.565 --> 16:25.567
I believe in fairness.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.238
I'm doing you a favor since I owe you one.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.033
But admit this.

16:33.117 --> 16:33.951
What?

16:34.034 --> 16:35.703
Admit that what you did today

16:36.412 --> 16:38.706
was rude, disrespectful, and out--

16:41.291 --> 16:43.043
And out of line. Admit that.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.294
I liked the rhythm.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.172
Didn't you see how they were?

16:47.256 --> 16:51.010
I couldn't let them take the bus
and hold their bladders during the trip.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.512
And my truck would've been
too uncomfortable for them.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.972
You did a good deed.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.391
You're too nosy.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.937
Like I said before,
I hate it when people cross the line.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.815
-Don't let this happen again.
-Drop me off here.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.109
-I clearly warned you, okay?
-At that crosswalk.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.913
What a rough driver.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.124
By the way, why did you come to Seoul?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.168
-What's your business?
-Bye.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.631
He's just not likable.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.009
Darn it, I'm late!

17:40.726 --> 17:44.021
HEALTH AND MEDICAL CENTER
SEOUL NEW-GEN UROLOGY CLINIC

17:51.612 --> 17:54.364
HOPE SMILE DENTIST
PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

18:04.541 --> 18:07.795
Gangwon Province sure is far,
seeing how you were late today.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.297
I had my reasons.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.508
At least I took the photo.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.511
Gosh, Hye-jin used to be so punctual

18:15.594 --> 18:18.388
that her nickname was Cinderella.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.642
You're right. Whenever we had
a get-together,

18:21.725 --> 18:23.143
you'd leave before midnight.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.563
That was ages ago.
Let's talk about the present.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.065
How have you guys been?

18:28.148 --> 18:30.275
Same old. Working on weekdays,

18:30.359 --> 18:32.736
golfing and shopping on weekends.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.198
Ji-won, how does it feel
to open a clinic in Gangnam?

18:36.281 --> 18:38.659
Me? I'm not really that excited about it.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.870
I spend most of my income
paying off my loan.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.206
I'm barely making ends meet.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.208
Last year, I paid
300 million won in taxes.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.212
They awarded me
for being an exemplary taxpayer.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.924
But that's just another way
of saying that I'm a pushover.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.760
How much do you make
to pay so much in taxes?

18:56.844 --> 19:00.681
Well… I think I'm making
a decent amount of money.

19:04.309 --> 19:08.730
But in some ways, I envy Hye-jin.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.401
A seaside dental clinic in the country.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.612
It's so simple and cute.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.286
You're not so up-to-date, are you?

19:22.369 --> 19:25.914
No wonder people think
Seoulites have narrow views.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.959
-What?
-Rural areas are more developed now.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.588
It's truly wonderful. You don't need
to go abroad to appreciate nice views.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.341
And the hospitals make
a hefty amount of profit.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.051
I'm the only dentist there,

19:38.135 --> 19:41.346
so my clinic is flooded with patients.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.765
There's even an article
about doctors in rural areas

19:43.849 --> 19:45.767
making more money than those in the city?

19:46.393 --> 19:49.104
Sorry. I forgot.
You don't read newspapers.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.201
How dare they all mock me?

20:03.285 --> 20:04.786
I'm so annoyed.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.207
I'll have a good trip. Don't cry.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.169
My baby girl.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.754
Call me once you arrive.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.798
-Okay.
-I'm just worried. That's all.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.133
Go home and rest.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.178
-Don't cry. Your makeup will run.
-Okay.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.098
-Be good to my girl.
-Yes, ma'am.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.975
What are you staring at?

20:28.393 --> 20:30.562
What? What are you doing here?

20:30.646 --> 20:34.399
Are you jealous that they're married
and going on a honeymoon?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.026
How did you know I'd be here?

20:36.109 --> 20:37.444
I saw the invitation.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.071
It was next to the wet wipes.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.574
I left my phone in your car.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.994
Still, you shouldn't have come here!
Someone might see us!

20:46.078 --> 20:48.830
Are you a celebrity
or something? Stop overreacting.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.626
Everyone from my university is here.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.044
This is insane.

20:55.087 --> 20:55.921
Follow me.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.006
Did I do something wrong?

21:02.636 --> 21:06.014
Fine. Come on. Why are you…

21:07.349 --> 21:08.642
Stop it. I'm going.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.744
I wasn't planning to get a ride from you.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.621
Remember that.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.290
Whatever.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.208
Drop me off at the terminal if you want.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.918
At the terminal?

21:35.585 --> 21:38.171
-We've already passed it.
-Oh, well.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.258
Then I'll just let you give a ride.
This is nice.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.930
Let me know if you get tired.
We can take turns driving.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.600
Forget it. I hate it
when other people touch my stuff.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.520
Besides, this is a new car.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.148
Fine by me. I can just relax.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.042
I'd love to have
some wine by the Han River.

22:15.792 --> 22:19.004
Drinking <i>makgeolli</i> by the ocean
is just magnificent.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.218
That restaurant has great pasta.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.014
Eating snow crab <i>ramyeon</i>
on a boat is the best.

22:30.557 --> 22:34.102
I can't believe
I have to return to the boondocks.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.314
There are skyscrapers everywhere.
It's so suffocating.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.485
I can't wait to go back to Gongjin.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.156
Can you turn the AC on?

22:48.241 --> 22:49.409
Turn it on yourself.

22:51.411 --> 22:52.662
Don't touch my car.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.763
DON'T LITTER
1 MILLION WON FINE

23:11.056 --> 23:14.351
They must've thought
they wouldn't get caught on weekends.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.522
If I find you, you're dead meat!

23:19.106 --> 23:21.399
What should I do? Chief Hong isn't here.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.069
-He's not here?
-He went to Seoul.

23:24.152 --> 23:27.197
He's been visiting Seoul often lately.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.407
Hye-jin went to Seoul too.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.452
Hello, Ms. Landlady.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.789
You're that friend of hers
who lives with her.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.249
Yes. You're right.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.670
You're our patient, Mr. Choi Eun-cheol.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.797
-Hello.
-You were a police officer?

23:43.880 --> 23:44.798
Yes.

23:44.881 --> 23:48.260
Gosh, you look so different in a uniform.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.637
You look so reliable.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.515
When you visited our clinic,
you were terrified and trembling.

23:53.598 --> 23:54.432
I wasn't.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.518
-Were you?
-No.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.980
Next time, you don't
have to be so nervous.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.982
See you at the clinic.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.402
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

24:23.378 --> 24:24.629
Did I see wrong?

24:27.465 --> 24:30.177
Damn it. Take a photo for evidence.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.637
We should install a surveillance camera.

24:34.347 --> 24:37.350
<i>The toll is 12,700 won.</i>

24:45.275 --> 24:46.651
We're almost home.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.196
When did I fall asleep?

24:49.779 --> 24:52.616
There was one traffic jam
after another, yet you never woke up.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.743
It's very comfortable. You got a nice car.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.206
Am I a chauffeur or what?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.166
I've been driving all day long.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.960
I offered to take turns driving,
but you declined.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.130
You shouldn't have left me bored at least.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.507
I remembered that
you preferred driving quietly.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.802
Well, aren't you so kindhearted?

25:13.303 --> 25:16.514
<i>Someone littered again.
We're having a meeting at the restaurant.</i>

25:16.598 --> 25:20.018
Since you're driving anyway,
drop me off at the raw fish restaurant.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.187
There's an emergency meeting,

25:23.813 --> 25:24.981
and I'm too lazy to walk.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.652
-Get out here.
-Sorry.

25:38.161 --> 25:42.374
CLASSMATES CHATROOM

25:45.001 --> 25:45.961
What?

25:46.628 --> 25:48.004
When did this get taken?

25:50.048 --> 25:52.300
<i>I didn't know you had a boyfriend.</i>

25:52.384 --> 25:53.969
Boyfriend, my foot.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.933
<i>He's not my boyfriend.
I just ran into someone I knew.</i>

26:00.016 --> 26:03.228
<i>Boyfriend? Gosh, he's so cute.</i>

26:03.311 --> 26:05.814
<i>Totally. Where did you meet
such a handsome guy?</i>

26:05.897 --> 26:08.525
<i>I was surprised too when I saw him.</i>

26:10.527 --> 26:12.821
<i>He's not a boyfriend.</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:15.699
<i>I'm not interested,
but he keeps chasing me.</i>

26:23.957 --> 26:25.000
This is cute?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.344
How could you sleep
when I'm driving like this?

27:18.219 --> 27:19.220
Look at you.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.347
GONGJIN MARKET

28:54.232 --> 28:55.316
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

28:55.400 --> 28:58.403
The ideal temperature for drip coffee
is between 88°C and 95°C.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.487
What did I say?

29:00.321 --> 29:02.282
-Ninety…
-Five degrees.

29:02.365 --> 29:05.744
Now, when you pour water,
start at the center.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.289
Slowly spiral outward

29:09.831 --> 29:12.041
then bring it back to the center.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.754
Once these bubbles disappear,

29:15.837 --> 29:18.047
you start the second brew.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.343
-It looks like bread that's rising.
-Right. Isn't it cute?

29:22.427 --> 29:23.928
-Hello.
-Yes.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.389
-Hello. Come sit down.
-Going to work?

29:26.973 --> 29:29.517
-You work here too?
-At times when he asks for help.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.436
What a strange lifestyle you lead.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.189
Do you even know what you're doing?

29:34.272 --> 29:35.857
Try some if you're curious.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.692
He's one talented man.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.195
He's a certified barista.
He's teaching me right now.

29:40.278 --> 29:43.448
-I see.
-Pour some water again and give it to her.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.783
-Me?
-Yes.

29:44.866 --> 29:45.909
Really?

29:47.660 --> 29:49.788
-Is it already time?
-Yes.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.373
All right. My first coffee.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.458
Where are you going?

29:53.541 --> 29:55.418
Remove the dripper, or it'll get bitter.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.878
Okay.

29:57.879 --> 30:00.507
All right. You're my very first customer.

30:01.549 --> 30:03.259
A cup of latte, please.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.303
With a lot of syrup.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.014
This doesn't suit me, does it?

30:09.974 --> 30:11.184
Something's off.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.144
Gosh, this thing…

30:28.910 --> 30:29.911
What are you doing?

30:32.580 --> 30:35.625
This candy wakes me up, you know.

30:35.708 --> 30:39.045
Mondays always make me drowsy.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.632
Just Mondays? You doze off
throughout the entire week.

30:42.715 --> 30:44.467
You little…

30:44.551 --> 30:46.970
-Goodness.
-Hello, everyone.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.721
Hello.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.139
-Here.
-Take this.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.267
What brings you here? Gosh.

30:53.059 --> 30:55.478
-What is this?
-Can't you see? It's trash.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.897
Exactly. Why did you bring it here?

30:57.981 --> 31:00.692
There have been 24 cases of littering
at the market this year,

31:00.775 --> 31:03.611
and we've asked you nine times
to install a security camera.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.155
However, the camera is nowhere to be seen,

31:06.239 --> 31:09.325
and another case happened yesterday.
Are you okay?

31:09.409 --> 31:13.955
I already asked city hall,
but it hasn't been approved yet.

31:14.038 --> 31:17.292
Of course. I completely
understand your situation.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.336
You have a tight budget
and a ton of work. It must be tough.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.297
Gosh. Thanks for understanding.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.424
So we're going to catch them ourselves.

31:24.507 --> 31:27.343
-What? How?
-Every crime leaves a trace.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.762
The evidence must be in here.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.643
We're going to find out
what they ate and threw away right here.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.769
-Should I?
-Rip it.

31:36.853 --> 31:37.896
-Okay.
-Du-sik, don't!

31:37.979 --> 31:39.522
Let me go!

31:39.606 --> 31:41.858
-I need to tear this open!
-No, you don't!

31:41.941 --> 31:44.485
-Then I'll open this.
-Hwa-jeong, don't!

31:44.569 --> 31:45.445
"Hwa-jeong"?

31:46.404 --> 31:49.449
Know when to talk professionally,
Mr. Chang.

31:49.532 --> 31:52.702
God! Right! I'm sorry, Ms. Yeo.

31:52.785 --> 31:57.916
Du-sik! Right! I happen to have
some business at city hall today.

31:57.999 --> 32:03.254
I'll go right up to them and make sure
they understand what we want!

32:04.088 --> 32:07.467
I'm serious. I want a camera too!
I'll get it installed!

32:07.550 --> 32:11.387
Do you? A 3-million-pixel HD camera
with adjustable angles. Deal?

32:11.471 --> 32:13.890
-Got it. Let's do that. I'll get it.
-Okay.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.643
So get this out of here. Now.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.482
What lovely weather.

32:22.565 --> 32:25.985
It's a great day
to file a complaint. Have a good day.

32:26.069 --> 32:26.986
Yeong-guk!

32:28.196 --> 32:29.405
Are you okay?

32:29.906 --> 32:30.782
Gosh.

32:31.658 --> 32:35.453
I don't think I can live a long life.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.829
Open the windows!

32:37.830 --> 32:41.584
WE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE FAMILY
GONGJIN-DONG

32:52.804 --> 32:54.013
We have a full schedule.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.225
Yes. Make sure you stretch beforehand.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.477
Stretch? Okay.

33:00.353 --> 33:03.314
Hye-jin, help me out. Look.

33:04.732 --> 33:07.694
Which color suits me better?

33:07.777 --> 33:09.070
They're both pretty.

33:10.446 --> 33:11.864
-This one.
-This?

33:15.952 --> 33:17.704
What's with the makeup?

33:17.787 --> 33:19.580
Our booked patient will be here soon.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.999
-A booked patient?
-Yes.

33:21.082 --> 33:24.419
Who is it? "Lee Seung-gi, Choi Eun-cheol…"

33:26.170 --> 33:28.214
-Hello.
-Hello.

33:28.297 --> 33:29.674
Hello.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.637
-Please wait one minute.
-Okay.

33:38.057 --> 33:40.852
-Let me help you.
-Okay.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.356
-This way.
-Okay.

33:55.658 --> 33:58.578
We're done with the root canal treatment.

33:58.661 --> 34:01.330
Ms. Pyo, please take care of the rest.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.331
Yes, ma'am.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.793
-Keep your mouth open.
-Okay.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.880
I'm going to
temporarily fill in your tooth.

34:08.963 --> 34:11.716
Mr. Choi, what did you do last weekend?

34:13.634 --> 34:17.305
You worked? It must've been tiring.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.724
What do you do in your free time?

34:21.768 --> 34:24.729
I see. You must enjoy reading.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.523
What's your favorite book?

34:34.572 --> 34:37.158
<i>My Sweet Orange Tree.</i>

34:38.576 --> 34:39.744
Open your mouth.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.503
What was that?

34:49.921 --> 34:51.297
How did she understand?

34:54.258 --> 34:56.385
Bye. I'll really get going.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.303
Bye!

35:00.848 --> 35:02.934
-Want a ride?
-Of course.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.020
What are you holding?

35:06.104 --> 35:09.440
I got a halibut as a thank you.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.151
Grill it for your lunch.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.778
I'm going to have it with you.

35:13.861 --> 35:18.574
Look at you,
trying to make me cook for you.

35:19.158 --> 35:22.370
-You caught me.
-Hold on tight if you don't want to fall.

35:22.453 --> 35:25.164
-Okay.
-All right.

35:26.582 --> 35:28.543
-Let's go.
-Okay.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.972
<i>THEATER OF LIFE</i>

35:45.101 --> 35:47.145
Again? Aren't you sick of it?

35:47.228 --> 35:51.149
For me, this is
the most entertaining show ever.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.775
No wonder there's that song.

35:52.859 --> 35:56.154
<i>How wonderful would it be</i>

35:56.237 --> 35:57.655
<i>-If I was on TV?</i>
-Gosh.

35:57.738 --> 36:01.075
Stop that nonsense and eat up.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.748
I love this soy sauce marinated crab.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.334
What did Won-seok say? He liked it, right?

36:10.418 --> 36:13.421
I don't know. He was so busy

36:13.921 --> 36:15.548
that I had to leave right away.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.426
You went all the way there
but didn't get to eat together?

36:19.010 --> 36:23.264
Hey, mix some rice
in the shell and eat it.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.807
-Okay.
-It's delicious.

36:26.058 --> 36:27.226
What about you?

36:27.310 --> 36:28.811
I'm good.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.034
What was that back there?

36:43.534 --> 36:45.286
Are you interested in Mr. Choi?

36:45.369 --> 36:46.370
Yes.

36:46.454 --> 36:49.498
Unbelievable. You only met him twice.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.335
Hey, that doesn't matter.

36:52.418 --> 36:54.921
He's cute and looks amazing
in that uniform.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.591
I saw his birthdate,
and he's four years my junior.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.051
It's game over.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.511
Lucky it's so simple for you.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.766
How did you know his birthdate?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.895
Don't look into our patients' information.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.773
You're breaching
the Personal Information Protection Act.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.191
Dr. Yoon!

37:16.442 --> 37:17.568
Goodness.

37:19.946 --> 37:23.783
I know I agreed to take care of it,
but you can't barge in here like this.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.326
I know.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.372
But I missed it so much.

37:29.455 --> 37:32.833
Fine. Since you're here already,
take a good look.

37:34.126 --> 37:37.088
Dr. Yoon, have you held it on your palm?

37:37.171 --> 37:38.172
No.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.593
-Have you taken it for a walk at all?
-Of course not.

37:44.845 --> 37:48.140
I've been studying about hedgehogs lately.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.768
You can actually form a bond with them.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.145
And when you do,

37:53.229 --> 37:57.066
they lay down their spines
so you can pet them.

37:57.149 --> 38:00.653
Hey, feeding it and picking up
its poop is already a nuisance.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.364
And you'll be taking it back soon.

38:03.447 --> 38:07.368
Still, it'll be nice
to form a bond while it's here.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.873
When's the test? Is I-jun studying hard?

38:12.957 --> 38:15.251
He always studies hard.

38:15.334 --> 38:18.170
Anyway, it's his birthday today.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.880
I see.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.259
-Tell him I said happy birthday.
-Okay.

38:23.342 --> 38:26.137
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

38:26.220 --> 38:28.681
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

38:28.764 --> 38:32.184
<i>-Happy birthday, dear I-jun
-Happy birthday, dear I-jun</i>

38:32.268 --> 38:34.353
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

38:34.437 --> 38:36.522
Hooray!

38:36.605 --> 38:38.566
-Blow out the candles.
-Blow them.

38:46.532 --> 38:47.742
I-jun.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.871
Thank you for being my son.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.083
Here. This is from me.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.128
I got you the most expensive toy blocks.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.922
Have you ever seen him
play with toys before?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.674
I-jun, I got you a book.

39:04.633 --> 39:08.679
You got him a book? He always reads.
How thoughtless.

39:09.263 --> 39:12.850
Thank you. I promise to repay you
for your kindness when I get older.

39:12.933 --> 39:16.812
I-jun, I told you to speak casually to me.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.565
You agreed to do so, didn't you?

39:19.648 --> 39:21.942
That's how you can repay me.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.987
He's not a kid. Let him do as he wants.

39:25.571 --> 39:26.489
Don't force him.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.366
That's rich coming from someone

39:28.449 --> 39:31.369
who begged him to talk casually
and treat you like a friend.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.412
-Don't pretend you didn't.
-When did I?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.581
Last time, you begged him…

39:37.041 --> 39:38.626
I have something to say.

39:39.543 --> 39:43.047
Starting next year,
we don't need to gather for my birthday.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.299
You two are divorced.

39:52.473 --> 39:53.974
Right, we are.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.561
Son, are you hurt by that?

39:57.645 --> 40:01.065
I was when I was six.
But now that I'm nine, I'm okay.

40:01.941 --> 40:04.610
I'm glad. But our divorce

40:04.693 --> 40:08.656
doesn't change the fact
that you're our son.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.700
We want to celebrate
your birthday together.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.202
We really do.

40:13.285 --> 40:15.579
Yes. She's right.

40:15.663 --> 40:19.500
I-jun, your birthday is
the most important day of the year to me.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.502
It's like a national holiday.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.338
Okay.

40:24.964 --> 40:29.385
Do you want to try the cake, sweetie?
I bought the tastiest one.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.804
-Let's cut it.
-Dessert comes after the meal.

40:31.887 --> 40:33.973
Yes. You're right.

40:34.056 --> 40:35.641
-Right.
-Then let's eat.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.602
Yes, let's eat first.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.104
Go on.

40:41.647 --> 40:42.857
Eat first.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.734
Don't you know he waits
until the adults eat first?

40:45.818 --> 40:49.447
Right. I forgot. All right, look.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.908
Here I go. An entire spoonful.

40:55.661 --> 40:56.996
Thank you for the meal.

40:57.621 --> 40:58.622
Right.

40:59.665 --> 41:00.708
Let's eat.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.297
Thank you for the meal.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.923
Took you long enough.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.642
Your cucumber kimchi is still so tasty.

41:19.393 --> 41:23.397
You know, I crave it every now and then.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.067
Eat lots.

41:30.070 --> 41:33.741
I-jun, have some <i>japchae</i>.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.034
Have this.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.203
You must have some on your birthday.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.790
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

41:41.874 --> 41:44.376
Ms. Dentist, you have a patient.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.878
I said I didn't want to come.

41:45.961 --> 41:49.006
I'm going to give you an earful
once we're out of here!

41:49.089 --> 41:50.925
-That way?
-Gosh.

41:51.008 --> 41:54.094
-Yes.
-Let me down this instant!

41:54.678 --> 41:57.681
Judging by the x-ray,
you must have been in a lot of pain.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.684
Why? Is it bad?

42:00.768 --> 42:03.479
I'd like to speak with her,
so can you please butt out?

42:06.315 --> 42:07.316
Talk with her.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.444
There's not much to say.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.280
I've been chewing for the past 80 years.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.659
It's only natural
that my teeth have grown weak.

42:16.742 --> 42:19.828
But they're in pretty good condition
for your age.

42:19.912 --> 42:20.746
What?

42:20.829 --> 42:22.706
You can still get implants.

42:22.790 --> 42:26.502
Implants? I heard they're expensive.

42:26.585 --> 42:30.130
Well…. I understand
why you think that way.

42:30.214 --> 42:34.385
But your insurance will cover up to 2,
so you'll only pay 30 percent.

42:34.468 --> 42:36.387
You just need to pay for one.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.014
How much is that in total?

42:40.349 --> 42:42.726
Well… Let me see.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.605
About this much.

42:47.523 --> 42:50.859
Oh, dear. That's too expensive.

42:50.943 --> 42:54.863
Why would I spend
so much solely on my teeth?

42:54.947 --> 42:57.032
I'll just pull them out.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.201
-Grandma.
-What?

42:59.868 --> 43:04.790
If it's too expensive,
you can get dentures instead.

43:04.873 --> 43:09.461
But implants are
four times as strong as dentures.

43:09.545 --> 43:13.757
And since you have strong bones,
it'd be best if you got--

43:13.841 --> 43:15.884
Forget it. I don't need them.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.929
Just pull out all my weak teeth.

43:19.013 --> 43:22.474
Grandma, give it some thought and--

43:22.558 --> 43:23.601
Ma'am.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.645
Your teeth aren't just
something you can pull out.

43:26.729 --> 43:30.566
It could even be
life-threatening for the elderly.

43:30.649 --> 43:32.568
You won't be able to eat well,

43:32.651 --> 43:34.570
then you won't get enough nutrients.

43:34.653 --> 43:36.822
Your bones will weaken
and make it hard to walk.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.699
It could get really serious.

43:38.782 --> 43:41.285
Hey, you don't
have to scare her like that.

43:43.412 --> 43:44.455
Are you short on money?

43:44.538 --> 43:45.831
-Hey.
-What?

43:46.999 --> 43:48.709
Do you not have enough money?

43:48.792 --> 43:52.087
Not enough money? What do you take me for?

43:52.171 --> 43:57.259
I own a house here and a big area of land.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.719
That's not all.

43:59.386 --> 44:03.098
My son works as an accountant in Seoul.

44:03.182 --> 44:08.062
Gosh. And my granddaughter
goes to Harvard University in America.

44:09.021 --> 44:12.149
So you just don't want
to spend money on your treatment?

44:13.692 --> 44:15.694
Then I have nothing more to say.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.405
-You can leave.
-Hey.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.741
What? Unbelievable.

44:20.824 --> 44:22.701
Fine. I'll leave.

44:22.785 --> 44:25.704
You think being a dentist
makes you so great?

44:25.788 --> 44:28.874
-Fine. I'll leave.
-Grandma.

44:29.416 --> 44:30.501
Grandma.

44:31.126 --> 44:32.961
-Let's talk about this.
-No!

44:33.045 --> 44:35.214
-Hear me out.
-I don't want to.

44:35.297 --> 44:36.882
Come on.

44:36.965 --> 44:38.717
Let me just say something.

44:38.801 --> 44:40.010
-Grandma.
-Forget it.

44:41.261 --> 44:42.888
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

44:46.058 --> 44:47.017
I thought you left.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.186
-Was that necessary?
-What do you mean?

44:49.269 --> 44:51.814
"Are you short on money?"
How could a doctor say that?

44:51.897 --> 44:54.149
Were you going to send her away?

44:54.233 --> 44:55.275
Watch what you say.

44:55.776 --> 44:59.863
I only asked because she was adamant
about not getting the treatment.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.949
You could've put it nicely.

45:02.032 --> 45:04.410
No. A dental clinic
isn't a convenience store

45:04.493 --> 45:07.496
where you can ask for whatever you want.

45:08.080 --> 45:12.251
Pulling out your teeth is a huge deal.
She was too rash and stubborn about it.

45:12.334 --> 45:15.504
I understand what you mean,
but you could've said it differently.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.589
What if she was your grandmother?

45:17.673 --> 45:20.426
-But she isn't, so why should I care?
-What?

45:20.509 --> 45:24.847
And you. You're not even
her guardian, so why are you overreacting?

45:27.349 --> 45:29.977
People don't change so easily, do they?

45:41.655 --> 45:43.699
What was that? He's so annoying.

45:54.334 --> 45:56.462
CHUNG-HO HARDWARE

46:02.301 --> 46:04.511
What? Your goods haven't arrived.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.264
You only put in the order
and haven't paid yet, right?

46:07.347 --> 46:08.640
I already paid.

46:08.724 --> 46:09.975
Geum-cheol.

46:10.976 --> 46:12.644
You can't fool me.

46:15.063 --> 46:16.315
Fine, I haven't.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.484
Why do you ask?

46:23.447 --> 46:24.490
I know you.

46:24.573 --> 46:27.659
You never pay money upfront
before you check the goods.

46:27.743 --> 46:31.205
I'm begging you. Please stop coming here.

46:31.288 --> 46:33.540
I'll order it again next time.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.250
And aren't I your only friend?

46:35.334 --> 46:37.127
You're right.

46:37.211 --> 46:40.005
But I think I can manage
without having any friends.

46:40.088 --> 46:41.965
-Do you have any envelopes?
-I do.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.440
Isn't the weather lovely?

47:04.988 --> 47:06.990
Are you mad that I dragged you there?

47:09.201 --> 47:11.954
You seem pretty upset.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.417
But you see,
I'd like you to receive proper treatment.

47:17.501 --> 47:20.587
Aren't your toothaches
bothering you so much?

47:25.551 --> 47:28.929
So I'm going to give you something.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.973
Don't get mad, okay? You know

47:32.015 --> 47:34.560
I grew this big because you fed me.

47:35.143 --> 47:37.688
So I'd like to pay for your treatment.

47:37.771 --> 47:41.942
So with this,
how about we get those teeth fixed?

47:45.195 --> 47:49.616
I'll give you three seconds to run.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.160
-Come on, now.
-Three.

47:52.244 --> 47:53.579
-Let's…
-Two.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.080
Let's talk about this.

47:55.163 --> 47:56.832
-One.
-Grandma!

47:57.624 --> 47:59.167
Gosh, I got wet too.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.085
Grandma!

48:00.168 --> 48:02.296
-Get lost!
-Fine.

48:05.007 --> 48:08.468
-Grandma, I'll come back tomorrow.
-You're still here?

48:09.011 --> 48:10.846
-See you tomorrow.
-Gosh.

48:10.929 --> 48:12.723
<i>I hate him.</i>

48:12.806 --> 48:15.892
How dare he judge me?

48:15.976 --> 48:18.520
And why does he meddle
in other people's affairs?

48:19.271 --> 48:21.481
He should mind his own business.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.567
He's always so nosy.

48:23.650 --> 48:25.944
Does he want
to be complimented for his kindness?

48:26.028 --> 48:27.696
-Why are you so worked up?
-Am I?

48:29.489 --> 48:31.658
-I'm not.
-You're

48:31.742 --> 48:34.411
at 160bpm and 100dB at the least.

48:34.494 --> 48:37.831
I've never seen you
get so worked up over someone.

48:38.832 --> 48:42.878
I mean, he keeps rubbing me the wrong way.

48:44.296 --> 48:46.131
CHIEF HONG

48:47.841 --> 48:49.176
He's calling me.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.428
See? He's so irritating.

48:58.727 --> 49:00.562
Why did you call me so late?

49:00.646 --> 49:02.522
-You still came.
-Bye.

49:02.606 --> 49:03.732
Sit down.

49:17.829 --> 49:21.166
Do you know what those lights are?

49:21.917 --> 49:23.293
Who cares?

49:23.377 --> 49:24.961
They're squid boats.

49:25.671 --> 49:27.839
Those fishermen are hard at work.

49:28.507 --> 49:32.260
But from afar,
those boats just look like pretty lights.

49:35.806 --> 49:39.309
Ms. Gam-ri has been cleaning squid
for decades now.

49:39.393 --> 49:42.145
But she never gets sick of them
and loves squid the most,

49:43.063 --> 49:44.981
although she hasn't eaten them for years.

49:45.982 --> 49:48.568
If you're trying
to evoke sympathy, just stop.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.905
I'll pay for the treatment.
But I have a favor to ask you.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.282
What is it?

49:54.866 --> 49:56.201
Keep it a secret.

49:57.619 --> 50:00.831
Tell her it's some other cheap treatment.

50:01.873 --> 50:03.083
I can't do that.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.837
As a doctor, I need
to take responsibility for what I do.

50:07.504 --> 50:10.048
I must notify my patients
of the treatment process.

50:10.132 --> 50:13.135
Fine. Then just remind me
of the total cost.

50:14.177 --> 50:15.637
I'll pay the rest,

50:16.555 --> 50:19.015
so just tell her
that you gave her a discount.

50:19.099 --> 50:20.559
Why are you doing this?

50:21.226 --> 50:22.519
She doesn't want it.

50:22.602 --> 50:23.937
No, she just can't.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.691
She's been selfless all her life,

50:28.233 --> 50:31.111
so she doesn't know
how to take care of herself.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.155
So she endures the pain?

50:34.322 --> 50:36.616
-How selfish of her.
-"Selfish"?

50:37.325 --> 50:39.494
She's the most selfless woman
I've ever met.

50:39.578 --> 50:42.080
She did everything she could
to provide for her kids.

50:42.164 --> 50:45.167
And even now. She doesn't want
to burden them. Don't you get it?

50:45.250 --> 50:49.171
No, I don't understand.
It's foolish and frustrating to watch.

50:49.254 --> 50:50.964
Why are you so pessimistic?

50:51.047 --> 50:53.633
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

50:54.593 --> 50:57.220
Do you know
what it means to be a good parent?

50:58.263 --> 50:59.973
It's staying healthy for a long time.

51:02.726 --> 51:05.937
They shouldn't endure pain
to save money for their children.

51:07.022 --> 51:08.982
They should take care of themselves.

51:09.816 --> 51:10.817
Do you get it?

52:12.254 --> 52:15.966
<i>SUNDAE, TTEOK</i>

52:28.353 --> 52:29.896
Mom!

53:05.265 --> 53:06.182
Hey…

53:12.188 --> 53:13.607
Don't cry, Mom.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.443
I'm crying because I'm excited.

53:21.698 --> 53:22.782
Don't cry, dear.

53:22.866 --> 53:23.909
You too.

53:29.956 --> 53:31.541
<i>My mom passed away.</i>

53:33.418 --> 53:37.839
<i>It's okay. I don't remember
much anyway since I was so little.</i>

53:40.342 --> 53:41.968
No, you're not okay.

53:59.527 --> 54:00.904
Ms. Gam-ri.

54:01.863 --> 54:03.573
Ms. Gam-ri.

54:04.115 --> 54:07.911
I didn't bring any money today.
I'm serious. I didn't bring it.

54:10.830 --> 54:14.376
How could you throw water at me?
I could've caught a cold.

54:15.210 --> 54:18.296
No one catches a cold
during the summertime.

54:18.380 --> 54:22.217
You saw how scary I was
when I got angry, right?

54:22.801 --> 54:25.512
I did. I won't upset you anymore.

54:27.430 --> 54:29.891
Why aren't you using the washing machine?

54:30.725 --> 54:33.728
There's not much laundry
to run the washer.

54:33.812 --> 54:35.397
It's a waste of electricity.

54:35.480 --> 54:37.065
Let me do it. Go sit down.

54:37.148 --> 54:39.317
-It's okay.
-No, let me.

54:40.193 --> 54:41.486
Rub it well,

54:41.569 --> 54:43.780
-Okay.
-or it won't be clean enough.

54:43.863 --> 54:47.242
Gosh, you and your nagging.
Fine. Look. Happy?

54:47.325 --> 54:49.577
-Good.
-Go sit down.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.287
I'll leave it to you.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.540
Okay, enough nagging.

54:58.169 --> 54:59.004
Grandma.

54:59.963 --> 55:01.965
I'm actually upset with you.

55:03.049 --> 55:05.176
You accept money from your son,

55:05.260 --> 55:08.054
but why not from me?
Am I a stranger or what?

55:08.138 --> 55:11.099
Do you want to get drenched again?

55:11.182 --> 55:12.183
I take it back.

55:19.691 --> 55:25.196
I love the sound
of that bell you hung for me.

55:26.614 --> 55:29.200
Right? Enjoy the sound.

55:29.868 --> 55:32.037
And go enjoy a lot of great views

55:32.120 --> 55:34.831
and eat a lot of good food.

55:38.334 --> 55:40.045
Someone told me

55:40.545 --> 55:44.549
that the best thing a parent can do
for their child is staying healthy.

55:51.473 --> 55:55.226
Gosh, this is a superb bar of soap.
I wonder who made it.

55:57.103 --> 56:00.607
Who made it?
It's no other than Du-sik himself.

56:02.025 --> 56:05.236
<i>Ms. Gam-ri has been cleaning squid
for decades now.</i>

56:06.071 --> 56:08.740
<i>But she never gets sick of them
and loves squid the most,</i>

56:09.616 --> 56:11.576
<i>although she hasn't eaten them for years.</i>

56:13.411 --> 56:14.913
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

56:15.538 --> 56:17.207
Isn't the squid too tough to chew?

56:17.290 --> 56:18.416
Really?

56:22.545 --> 56:24.672
Hey, all squid are about this tough.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.299
Really?

56:33.556 --> 56:35.183
This is tough too.

56:35.266 --> 56:36.684
What's gotten into you?

56:37.977 --> 56:39.771
This too.

56:42.524 --> 56:45.401
And this. Why are they
all so difficult to chew?

56:45.485 --> 56:49.447
Hye-jin, I'm taking your food away
if you keep complaining about it.

56:50.782 --> 56:51.908
They're completely fine.

57:04.629 --> 57:06.047
<i>Hello?</i>

57:06.131 --> 57:10.343
Won-seok, are you busy right now?

57:10.426 --> 57:13.805
<i>I am, but I can talk for a minute.</i>

57:14.514 --> 57:18.309
I see. Did you have lunch?

57:18.393 --> 57:20.270
<i>Of course. It's past lunchtime.</i>

57:21.688 --> 57:24.441
Right. Did you try
the soy sauce marinated crab?

57:25.358 --> 57:29.487
You've always liked it
since you were little.

57:29.571 --> 57:33.992
<i>Well, I've been too swamped
with work to eat at home lately.</i>

57:34.784 --> 57:36.077
<i>I'll have it today.</i>

57:36.161 --> 57:38.830
Why are you so busy?

57:38.913 --> 57:41.666
Take good care of your health.

57:41.749 --> 57:44.335
-<i>You too, Mom.</i>
-Okay.

57:44.419 --> 57:48.548
<i>By the way, Du-sik called a few days ago.</i>

57:49.424 --> 57:50.633
He did?

57:51.759 --> 57:53.928
Hey, Won-seok. It's me, Du-sik.

57:54.471 --> 57:55.930
Have you been well?

57:56.639 --> 57:58.808
You see,

57:58.892 --> 58:02.437
I took your mom to the dentist.
Her teeth aren't in good condition.

58:02.520 --> 58:05.482
She needs implants,
but she's vehemently refusing to get them.

58:05.565 --> 58:07.108
Right. I know.

58:08.359 --> 58:10.987
How about you convince her?

58:11.070 --> 58:14.657
Did Du-sik tell you about it already?

58:15.325 --> 58:18.661
So what do you think I should do?

58:19.204 --> 58:23.583
<i>I heard you were refusing to get
the implants. I can't force you to do it.</i>

58:24.417 --> 58:25.585
<i>I looked it up.</i>

58:26.294 --> 58:29.756
<i>And some say that dental implants
are rather bad for the elderly.</i>

58:29.839 --> 58:33.051
<i>So won't it be better
to get dentures later?</i>

58:33.134 --> 58:35.386
-What?
<i>-You see…</i>

58:35.470 --> 58:37.472
<i>money is tight this year.</i>

58:37.555 --> 58:39.557
<i>Min-ju is studying in the States,</i>

58:40.850 --> 58:42.519
<i>and her tuition is quite expensive.</i>

58:44.646 --> 58:49.108
Oh, dear. Don't worry about me.

58:49.192 --> 58:51.611
I'm completely fine.

58:51.694 --> 58:56.157
Don't worry about me,
and focus on your family.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.787
How is Min-ju doing?

59:08.586 --> 59:10.296
It's so hectic today.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.090
You're doing well.

59:12.590 --> 59:14.717
You know, we had more patients this week.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.595
Do you think word has gotten out
about my skills?

59:17.679 --> 59:18.763
It must have.

59:24.519 --> 59:26.062
PATIENT CHART
KIM GAM-RI

59:38.366 --> 59:41.494
Why am I here? I must be nuts.

59:44.622 --> 59:45.540
Hello.

59:46.040 --> 59:47.584
Goodbye.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.127
Wait.

59:50.169 --> 59:52.297
Did you have dinner?

59:53.673 --> 59:54.507
No.

59:55.508 --> 59:57.427
I didn't have any rice,

59:57.927 --> 1:00:00.430
so I made some potato dough soup.

1:00:00.513 --> 1:00:03.016
-Have you tried it before?
-No.

1:00:03.099 --> 1:00:04.976
Try some.

1:00:05.059 --> 1:00:09.564
I ground some fresh potatoes,
got moisture out of it,

1:00:09.647 --> 1:00:12.108
and boiled it in meat broth.

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:14.235
They're very chewy and delicious.

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:16.154
Thank you.

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:21.492
How is it?

1:00:22.368 --> 1:00:23.911
It's really good.

1:00:23.995 --> 1:00:24.829
I'm glad.

1:00:24.912 --> 1:00:26.789
-Eat up.
-Okay.

1:00:34.714 --> 1:00:39.218
<i>The elderly Ms. Gam-ri went to her room
to show us her most treasured belonging…</i>

1:00:39.302 --> 1:00:43.598
This is me two years ago.

1:00:43.681 --> 1:00:45.808
We filmed it in that very room.

1:00:47.894 --> 1:00:50.313
-I see.
<i>-Look at this.</i>

1:00:50.396 --> 1:00:53.941
-Gosh.
<i>-This is proof that my late father</i>

1:00:54.025 --> 1:01:00.198
<i>served in the Korean Independence Army
in 1941</i>

1:01:00.281 --> 1:01:05.453
<i>and was assigned to the second unit.</i>

1:01:05.536 --> 1:01:10.124
<i>My mom gave this to me,
and I kept it ever since.</i>

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:13.670
<i>But I couldn't read
the Chinese characters.</i>

1:01:14.337 --> 1:01:17.965
<i>Then 30 years ago,</i>

1:01:18.049 --> 1:01:21.302
<i>a little boy read this to me.</i>

1:01:21.386 --> 1:01:24.138
<i>He was such a smart boy.</i>

1:01:24.222 --> 1:01:27.016
<i>-He was a prodigy.
-Grandma!</i>

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:28.893
<i>-What? Goodness.
-Grandma.</i>

1:01:28.976 --> 1:01:31.437
<i>Speak of the devil.</i>

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:33.898
<i>This is Du-sik.</i>

1:01:33.981 --> 1:01:34.982
<i>Yes, Du-sik.</i>

1:01:36.192 --> 1:01:38.861
Look. There's our Du-sik.

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:42.949
Thanks to him,
my late dad was acknowledged

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:46.327
as a patriot who fought
for our nation's independence.

1:01:46.411 --> 1:01:47.870
When was it aired?

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:49.706
Two years ago.

1:01:51.290 --> 1:01:55.336
My dad named me after the Korean flag.

1:01:55.420 --> 1:02:00.675
As you know, there are <i>geon, gon, gam,</i>
and <i>ri</i> in the flag. I'm Gam-ri.

1:02:01.259 --> 1:02:04.971
And my older brother's name was Geon-gon.

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:07.682
-That's right.
-What a great name.

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:10.226
You must be proud of your father.

1:02:10.309 --> 1:02:13.396
Of course. I sure am.

1:02:15.189 --> 1:02:17.859
Goodness. You haven't been eating

1:02:17.942 --> 1:02:20.820
because I've been rambling on.

1:02:20.903 --> 1:02:24.866
No wonder people say
old people talk so much. Gosh.

1:02:25.867 --> 1:02:28.661
-Eat up.
-Okay.

1:02:33.666 --> 1:02:35.168
Thank you for the meal.

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:40.006
Rather, I should thank you
for driving me to Seoul.

1:02:40.089 --> 1:02:41.424
Thank you.

1:02:46.053 --> 1:02:49.891
I actually came by to tell you something,
but I had dinner instead.

1:02:49.974 --> 1:02:53.394
Of course.
Eating comes before anything else.

1:02:53.478 --> 1:02:55.480
Nothing's more important than that.

1:02:55.563 --> 1:02:57.231
Exactly.

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.817
If you knew that,

1:02:59.901 --> 1:03:02.528
how could you ask me
to pull your teeth out?

1:03:06.532 --> 1:03:09.619
Toothaches are truly a pity.

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:12.413
It doesn't show,

1:03:12.497 --> 1:03:16.375
so no one but yourself
knows how painful it is.

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:18.503
Not even your kids.

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:31.182
Please come back to the clinic.

1:03:32.767 --> 1:03:36.771
I can't do it for free, but I'll
only charge you for the materials.

1:03:38.022 --> 1:03:39.065
What?

1:03:40.358 --> 1:03:42.985
But you have to keep it a secret.

1:03:43.528 --> 1:03:45.696
No one else should know.

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:50.117
If people get wind of this,
I may have to close down my clinic.

1:03:50.868 --> 1:03:53.913
Then you shouldn't do this for me.

1:03:55.373 --> 1:03:57.416
I heard squid is your favorite food.

1:04:00.670 --> 1:04:04.340
My mom's favorite food was <i>sundae</i>.

1:04:07.552 --> 1:04:11.264
I just want to help you enjoy it again.

1:04:12.014 --> 1:04:13.140
That's all.

1:04:17.311 --> 1:04:20.189
Du-sik must've said something to you.

1:04:21.524 --> 1:04:24.652
He's kind but too nosy.

1:04:26.112 --> 1:04:27.321
I agree.

1:04:30.032 --> 1:04:33.828
He hung that bell for me.

1:04:58.936 --> 1:05:02.356
Darn it. It must've been a big one.

1:05:03.983 --> 1:05:04.984
What's that?

1:05:06.527 --> 1:05:10.948
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1:05:21.292 --> 1:05:22.960
Hello.

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:25.796
All right.

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:27.423
I'm here

1:05:27.506 --> 1:05:29.050
to get my implants done.

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:31.218
I'm glad you came.

1:05:31.302 --> 1:05:33.304
Can I pay first?

1:05:33.387 --> 1:05:36.557
First, you should consult with me.

1:05:36.641 --> 1:05:38.851
We're done talking.

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:41.395
I've already prepared the money.

1:05:44.065 --> 1:05:45.566
I'll pay it all at once.

1:05:48.194 --> 1:05:53.032
I've been working like a dog all my life,

1:05:53.115 --> 1:05:56.911
so don't you think I deserve to eat
as much squid as I want?

1:05:56.994 --> 1:05:59.121
It's too tough, so you should be careful.

1:05:59.205 --> 1:06:02.541
-What?
-Have it once a week.

1:06:04.877 --> 1:06:07.171
I got 3-million-pixel HD cameras.
And 2 of them.

1:06:07.254 --> 1:06:09.674
You can also adjust the angles freely.

1:06:11.425 --> 1:06:13.219
It was easy but took you long enough.

1:06:13.302 --> 1:06:17.890
Ms. Yeo, don't hurt my feelings like that.

1:06:17.974 --> 1:06:21.978
I had to have a serious talk
with the mayor to get those.

1:06:22.061 --> 1:06:25.064
Good job. Thank you for your help.

1:06:25.690 --> 1:06:28.776
So why couldn't you
have talked with him sooner?

1:06:28.859 --> 1:06:30.820
You were always a slowpoke.

1:06:30.903 --> 1:06:32.822
Ms. Yeo, what you just said

1:06:32.905 --> 1:06:35.199
was very private. It was personal.

1:06:35.282 --> 1:06:37.535
Shut it and just take this.

1:06:38.035 --> 1:06:41.080
-What is it?
-What do you think? It's cucumber kimchi.

1:06:41.914 --> 1:06:43.416
You said you craved it.

1:06:44.125 --> 1:06:45.501
Gosh.

1:06:46.335 --> 1:06:47.336
Gosh.

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:53.092
Move around. Let's see if they're working.

1:06:53.175 --> 1:06:54.844
Why, hello, Ms. Gam-ri.

1:06:54.927 --> 1:06:58.264
<i>Bring me some porridge this instant.</i>

1:06:58.347 --> 1:06:59.390
Porridge?

1:07:01.350 --> 1:07:02.476
Grandma!

1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:04.020
Grandma.

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:07.648
Where does it hurt?

1:07:08.983 --> 1:07:10.359
Bring the table.

1:07:10.443 --> 1:07:11.861
Okay. Hold on.

1:07:13.612 --> 1:07:15.322
Where does it hurt?

1:07:15.406 --> 1:07:17.825
You never asked me
to bring porridge before.

1:07:17.908 --> 1:07:21.912
I didn't know
dental implants would be this painful.

1:07:21.996 --> 1:07:26.667
Now that the anesthesia
has worn off, my head is ringing.

1:07:26.751 --> 1:07:27.877
What?

1:07:28.461 --> 1:07:31.130
I went to the dental clinic this morning.

1:07:32.298 --> 1:07:35.301
-Grandma!
-Stop calling me

1:07:35.384 --> 1:07:38.471
-and give me the porridge. I'm starving.
-Okay.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:43.517
How did such a stubborn woman
like you have a change of heart?

1:07:45.144 --> 1:07:48.856
Dr. Yoon visited me yesterday.

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:50.566
She did?

1:07:50.649 --> 1:07:52.777
She offered to give me a discount

1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:56.363
and told me to get the treatment already.

1:07:57.406 --> 1:08:01.619
I thought she was
a sly fox, but I was wrong.

1:08:02.912 --> 1:08:05.247
On the outside, she's as cold as ice.

1:08:05.790 --> 1:08:08.167
But she has a soft heart.

1:08:10.544 --> 1:08:15.382
She must have been
through a lot in her life.

1:08:19.553 --> 1:08:20.930
-Spoon.
-Right.

1:08:30.564 --> 1:08:31.565
What's going on?

1:08:32.566 --> 1:08:33.859
Is it a blackout?

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:52.128
Hello, Ms. Yeo. This is Hye-jin.

1:08:53.295 --> 1:08:55.923
I think the power went out.

1:09:06.433 --> 1:09:08.435
Don't you have any candles?

1:09:08.519 --> 1:09:11.147
Because blackouts aren't
that common in Seoul.

1:09:11.230 --> 1:09:13.399
Gosh. Sure.

1:09:16.735 --> 1:09:19.446
What was that? Did you just attack me?

1:09:20.114 --> 1:09:21.031
I never…

1:09:22.324 --> 1:09:24.201
Are you Hammurabi? An eye for an eye?

1:09:24.285 --> 1:09:26.453
-Say, "Teeth."
-Teeth?

1:09:28.497 --> 1:09:31.959
-And a tooth for a tooth.
-You're so childish.

1:09:32.501 --> 1:09:35.004
Hold on. Let's see.

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:42.386
Gosh, what don't you have
in that bag of yours?

1:09:42.469 --> 1:09:43.762
How did the blackout happen?

1:09:44.305 --> 1:09:48.350
I was washing my hair,
and the power went out all of a sudden.

1:09:48.434 --> 1:09:51.437
Did this happen
to the entire neighborhood?

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:55.274
No, just here. Did you check the fuse box?

1:09:55.357 --> 1:09:56.942
The fuse box?

1:09:58.360 --> 1:09:59.278
Where is it?

1:10:01.405 --> 1:10:02.239
Forget it.

1:10:03.949 --> 1:10:05.034
The fuse box?

1:10:08.412 --> 1:10:09.330
Gosh.

1:10:12.708 --> 1:10:13.959
I didn't know it was there.

1:10:15.961 --> 1:10:17.796
The circuit breaker is still on.

1:10:19.506 --> 1:10:21.425
I think it's the service wire.

1:10:22.176 --> 1:10:23.677
We should call the power company.

1:10:26.388 --> 1:10:29.183
Am I cursed or something?

1:10:29.266 --> 1:10:32.394
It's just a small incident. Hang on.

1:10:34.355 --> 1:10:35.773
Thank you.

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:41.445
There's an issue
with the power supply line. That's why.

1:10:41.528 --> 1:10:43.697
They're looking into it.
It'll get fixed soon.

1:10:44.281 --> 1:10:47.576
Does that mean
I have to wait in the dark like this?

1:10:48.494 --> 1:10:50.454
What? Are you scared?

1:10:51.455 --> 1:10:54.208
Of course not.
I'm not scared. It was just a question.

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:55.542
Where's your friend?

1:10:56.377 --> 1:10:57.586
She went to have a facial.

1:10:58.212 --> 1:11:00.214
Do you want me to wait with you
until she comes back?

1:11:05.094 --> 1:11:06.345
Do you want some ice cream?

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:15.271
I'm just afraid that the ice cream
will melt due to the blackout. Hold on.

1:11:31.912 --> 1:11:33.038
My goodness.

1:11:35.666 --> 1:11:37.710
Isn't that Bo-ra's hedgehog?

1:11:37.793 --> 1:11:38.627
It is.

1:11:39.295 --> 1:11:40.796
I didn't know it was here.

1:11:40.879 --> 1:11:42.256
Since you turned her down.

1:11:42.923 --> 1:11:46.510
I thought you would've
offered to help her gladly.

1:11:46.593 --> 1:11:47.970
Why did you decline?

1:11:49.847 --> 1:11:51.765
I don't take in anything that's alive.

1:11:55.269 --> 1:11:56.270
You guys are similar.

1:11:56.937 --> 1:11:58.689
The hedgehog is just like you.

1:11:59.898 --> 1:12:01.650
You're both spiky.

1:12:01.734 --> 1:12:04.278
-What are you talking about?
-You even look alike.

1:12:04.903 --> 1:12:06.530
You're so annoying.

1:12:06.613 --> 1:12:07.448
I'm sorry.

1:12:09.491 --> 1:12:10.492
What was that?

1:12:11.952 --> 1:12:14.496
It's unlike you to apologize right away.

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:18.292
I've been harsh on you
when I didn't know much about you.

1:12:21.337 --> 1:12:24.048
I misjudged you. Sorry.

1:12:25.632 --> 1:12:27.801
Stop that. You're scaring me.

1:12:28.552 --> 1:12:31.430
If you didn't visit her,
she wouldn't have gotten the treatment.

1:12:32.056 --> 1:12:32.973
Thanks.

1:12:35.434 --> 1:12:40.147
That's because… Well…
I didn't feel good about what I'd said.

1:12:41.023 --> 1:12:43.192
And she did pay me.

1:12:43.942 --> 1:12:46.904
I'm going to earn a lot here
and return to Seoul.

1:12:47.404 --> 1:12:49.406
That hasn't changed, so don't be mistaken.

1:12:49.490 --> 1:12:51.658
Fine. I hope you become filthy rich.

1:12:58.582 --> 1:12:59.625
Here.

1:13:03.837 --> 1:13:05.297
Thanks for the ice cream.

1:13:13.806 --> 1:13:16.642
What was that? It was so sudden.

1:13:21.146 --> 1:13:22.314
CHIEF HONG

1:13:25.484 --> 1:13:27.444
<i>Open the fuse box.</i>

1:13:35.327 --> 1:13:37.287
What? No way.

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:44.128
Chief Hong!

1:13:45.796 --> 1:13:46.797
Where'd you get this?

1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:48.465
Be quiet. You'll wake everyone up.

1:13:48.549 --> 1:13:49.508
Where'd you get this?

1:13:49.591 --> 1:13:51.176
On the street.

1:13:54.012 --> 1:13:57.391
It was swept out to sea.
Why does it look fine?

1:14:00.686 --> 1:14:01.770
Awesome.

1:14:30.215 --> 1:14:31.467
My God!

1:14:32.676 --> 1:14:34.720
Is that a leg?

1:14:42.728 --> 1:14:44.438
Why would a shoe be here?

1:14:45.105 --> 1:14:46.523
I thought it was a leg.

1:14:49.735 --> 1:14:50.569
What?

1:14:52.237 --> 1:14:53.614
HOW TO DRY WET SHOES

1:14:58.035 --> 1:14:58.869
Interesting.

HOW TO DRY SOAKED SHOES IN MONSOON SEASON

1:15:04.208 --> 1:15:06.335
WIPE THE INSIDE WITH NEWSPAPERS

1:15:06.418 --> 1:15:07.586
The inside too?

1:15:10.088 --> 1:15:13.884
<i>-Lastly, use cool air.</i>
-Use what?

1:15:13.967 --> 1:15:16.011
<i>Use cool air. Remember.</i>

1:16:44.808 --> 1:16:46.893
<i>He's always around
when you least expect it,</i>

1:16:46.977 --> 1:16:48.270
<i>so where is he today?</i>

1:16:48.353 --> 1:16:49.980
<i>You have a crush on this guy.</i>

1:16:50.063 --> 1:16:52.107
A man and woman can be just friends.

1:16:52.190 --> 1:16:54.234
<i>Many have been installing cameras
inside the examination room.</i>

1:16:54.318 --> 1:16:56.194
Doctor, you're quite the beauty.

1:16:56.278 --> 1:17:00.407
-Chief Hong only has today to spare.
-I'll be there.

1:17:00.490 --> 1:17:02.784
<i>-Dr. Yoon must be drunk.
-What?</i>

1:17:02.868 --> 1:17:06.371
It's Yoon Dental Clinic.
They need us there.

1:17:06.455 --> 1:17:07.497
Oh my.

1:17:07.581 --> 1:17:10.792
You can ask me just one question.

1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:13.337
Why did you come to Gongjin?
