00:05.352 --> 00:08.082
Areyou going to leave this up
all year?

00:08.154 --> 00:10.919
Yup. All year.

00:10.991 --> 00:12.925
Sinceyou always made us
take the Christmas tree down

00:12.993 --> 00:16.690
the day after Christmas,
I'm making up for lost time.

00:16.763 --> 00:21.223
Ifyour idea ofa good time is picking
up dried pine needles, treatyourself.

00:21.301 --> 00:25.294
As ifhe's an authority
on having a good time.

00:25.372 --> 00:26.999
That's okay, Mom.
I got that.

00:27.107 --> 00:28.938
Oh. Okay.

00:29.042 --> 00:30.976
Okay, Maggie,
let's shove off.

00:31.044 --> 00:33.808
Oh. Okay.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.609
Thankyou for having us.

00:35.682 --> 00:37.445
Dinnerwas delicious
as usual.

00:37.517 --> 00:39.109
Thanks, Mom.

00:41.588 --> 00:44.216
Good sailing, Ahab.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.259
Good night, Starbuck.

00:50.831 --> 00:53.299
How is work? Good?

00:53.367 --> 00:56.200
Yup. It's good.

00:56.269 --> 00:58.134
Well...

01:04.578 --> 01:06.978
- Well, drive carefully.
- Uh-huh.

01:12.552 --> 01:14.543
Good night, Daddy.

01:19.092 --> 01:21.026
(Applause)

01:21.094 --> 01:22.857
Here on lncredible lnventions though

01:22.929 --> 01:25.397
you're not going to spend
$1 1 0.00 for it.

01:25.465 --> 01:26.932
You all know that.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.127
You're not even going
to spend $1 00.00.

01:29.202 --> 01:31.636
There's an approximate
one-month supply here

01:31.705 --> 01:34.196
and all you'll spend
for this entire package

01:34.274 --> 01:37.243
isjust $39.92.

01:47.954 --> 01:50.548
Dad?

01:52.626 --> 01:56.426
I thoughtyou guys left.

01:56.496 --> 01:58.828
Where's Mom?

Hello.

02:25.659 --> 02:27.889
Maggie:
Dana...

02:27.961 --> 02:31.692
Mom?
What's the matter?

02:31.765 --> 02:34.996
We, um--

02:35.068 --> 02:38.435
We lostyour dad.

02:38.505 --> 02:40.530
He had a...

02:40.640 --> 02:44.599
a massive coronary
about an hour ago.

02:46.079 --> 02:49.276
He's gone.

I swear, Christmas day...

04:03.023 --> 04:06.459
mywhole family's
opening presents and all

04:06.526 --> 04:10.519
and I'm just sitting there
in my own little world thinking

04:10.597 --> 04:13.122
"I just wishJim were here."

04:13.233 --> 04:14.757
Man:
I know.

04:18.538 --> 04:20.438
(Knock On Window)

04:21.808 --> 04:25.107
Oh, man... busted.

04:27.347 --> 04:30.316
- Yes, sir?
- Out ofthe vehicle, please.

04:30.383 --> 04:33.682
Sir, I'm sorry.
We'll be on ourway.

04:33.753 --> 04:36.415
I said, out ofthe vehicle.

04:47.434 --> 04:49.868
Keepyour hands down.

04:52.539 --> 04:55.269
Let's see some l.D.

04:55.342 --> 04:57.936
No. Not until I seeyours.

05:02.015 --> 05:05.143
(Screams)

05:17.764 --> 05:20.358
Last time
you were that engrossed

05:20.467 --> 05:23.527
it turned outyou were reading
the Adult Video News.

05:23.637 --> 05:26.037
I didn't think
you'd be in today.

05:26.106 --> 05:28.597
How areyou, Dana?

05:28.708 --> 05:30.835
" Dana."

05:30.910 --> 05:32.844
I'm fine.
Thankyou.

05:32.912 --> 05:36.404
What areyou working on?

05:36.483 --> 05:39.475
Two days ago a couple was
kidnapped atJackson University.

05:39.552 --> 05:43.886
Elizabeth Hawley
andJames Summers-- both 1 9.

05:43.957 --> 05:46.517
Lastyear, another couple
was kidnapped to the day.

05:46.593 --> 05:49.562
Except that abduction occurred
at Duke University.

05:49.629 --> 05:53.156
One week later, they found
both students' bodies dead.

05:53.266 --> 05:56.429
Theywere kept alive,
tortured during that period.

05:56.536 --> 05:59.437
No arrests were made. Police believed
it to be a one-time offender.

05:59.506 --> 06:02.270
Now it appears to be
a serial incident.

06:02.342 --> 06:07.143
Ifhe holds true to form
we have five days to find those kids.

06:07.213 --> 06:09.477
That's a grim deadline.

06:09.549 --> 06:11.949
Here's another
grim deadline.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.112
In one week, Luther Lee Boggs
will take a seat

06:17.190 --> 06:19.181
in the North Carolina
gas chamber.

06:19.259 --> 06:21.420
How is he related?

06:21.494 --> 06:24.292
He claims
to have information.

06:24.364 --> 06:27.458
He described Hawley's bracelet
down to the last detail.

06:27.567 --> 06:30.195
This is information only
family members could have known.

06:30.303 --> 06:33.272
Or the kidnapper.

06:33.373 --> 06:37.867
Boggs feels that ifhis talents
help save these kids

06:37.944 --> 06:40.572
then his sentence should
be reduced to life in prison.

06:40.647 --> 06:43.081
His "talents"?

06:43.149 --> 06:45.413
He claims to have
obtained this information

06:45.485 --> 06:47.817
through psychic transmissions.

06:49.189 --> 06:52.215
Mulder, do I detect
a hint ofskepticism?

06:52.292 --> 06:54.089
Perhaps.

06:54.160 --> 06:58.096
Boggs has been there before...
in the chamber.

06:58.164 --> 07:00.257
My profile helped
send him there.

07:00.366 --> 07:02.334
He was actually
strapped to the chair

07:02.402 --> 07:05.269
before receiving
an executive stay.

07:05.338 --> 07:07.966
He claims that this experience
activated in him

07:08.041 --> 07:11.135
the ability to channel
spirits and demons.

07:11.211 --> 07:13.771
I believe in psychic ability
without a doubt.

07:13.847 --> 07:17.305
But not in this case.
Not Boggs.

07:17.383 --> 07:21.410
Soyou believe Boggs is orchestrating
the kidnapping from the inside.

07:21.488 --> 07:26.824
A scam to save his life?

07:26.893 --> 07:29.589
At the age ofsix,
Luther Boggs

07:29.662 --> 07:33.098
slaughtered every pet animal
in his housing project.

07:33.166 --> 07:36.761
When he was 30 he strangled five
family members overThanksgiving dinner

07:36.870 --> 07:40.237
and then sat down to watch the fourth
quarter ofthe Detroit-Green Bay game.

07:40.306 --> 07:44.299
Some killers are products
ofsociety.

07:44.377 --> 07:47.369
Some act out past abuses.

07:47.447 --> 07:51.747
Boggs kills because he likes it.

07:53.319 --> 07:55.412
And they've requested
you speakwith him?

07:55.488 --> 07:58.753
Actually, he's requested
to speak to me.

07:58.825 --> 08:02.090
- Whyyou?
- He read my profile on him

08:02.162 --> 08:06.326
and he feels like I'm the only one
who truly understands what he is.

08:06.432 --> 08:08.900
Anyway, I leave for Raleigh
this afternoon.

08:09.002 --> 08:11.095
I'll go with you.

08:13.206 --> 08:15.970
The funeral is at noon.

08:16.042 --> 08:18.704
I thinkyou should
take some time.

08:18.778 --> 08:20.609
I need to work.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.205
I'm sorry aboutyour father.

08:29.355 --> 08:31.380
- I'll seeyou later.
- Okay.

09:09.095 --> 09:11.563
As a captain he was entitled
to burial in Arlington

09:11.631 --> 09:15.658
with full ceremony.

09:15.768 --> 09:17.861
This is exactly
the way he wanted it.

09:20.106 --> 09:22.506
just the family.

09:26.779 --> 09:29.714
(" Beyond the Sea" Plays)

09:36.322 --> 09:41.521
This song was playing when his ship
returned from the Cuban blockade.

09:41.594 --> 09:46.224
He marched
right offup to me...

09:46.332 --> 09:48.664
and he proposed.

09:52.071 --> 09:57.202
I know thatyou and Dad
were... disappointed

09:57.277 --> 10:00.007
that I chose the path I'm on
instead ofmedicine

10:00.079 --> 10:02.343
but I need to know.

10:05.752 --> 10:07.982
Was he at all proud ofme?

10:10.690 --> 10:13.181
He was your father.

10:25.705 --> 10:29.869
The soul of Luther Boggs

10:29.943 --> 10:33.242
drowns in Hell's sea offire.

10:39.652 --> 10:41.586
We have him now.

10:41.654 --> 10:43.918
We?

10:43.990 --> 10:46.720
You mean the souls
ofyourvictims?

10:50.663 --> 10:53.154
The dead.

10:53.232 --> 10:55.700
The living.

10:55.768 --> 10:58.134
All souls are connected.

10:58.204 --> 11:00.640
And you're the conduit?

11:00.773 --> 11:03.571
(Labored Breathing)

11:06.179 --> 11:09.706
Uh, Dana...

11:11.784 --> 11:14.014
Fox...

11:14.087 --> 11:16.817
please understand
that from here

11:16.889 --> 11:20.256
we can return to the past.

11:20.326 --> 11:24.592
We can see the present.
We can know the future.

11:24.697 --> 11:26.927
From here?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.468
Where exactly areyou?

11:40.380 --> 11:44.874
Mr. Boggs must be made
redemptive

11:44.951 --> 11:47.476
for his transgressions.

11:47.553 --> 11:50.113
That's what the State
of North Carolina

11:50.189 --> 11:52.157
intends to do next week.

11:56.129 --> 11:57.858
Uh-uh.

11:58.965 --> 12:01.798
Let's deal.

12:01.868 --> 12:05.599
Boggs' life for the kids.
You know what I'm saying?

12:05.671 --> 12:09.129
Firstyou've got to prove
you're telling the truth.

12:15.181 --> 12:17.672
Don't get me wrong,
Luther.

12:19.886 --> 12:22.912
I want to believe.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.588
(Groaning)

12:31.931 --> 12:34.627
Oh!

12:34.700 --> 12:36.429
Oh!

12:36.502 --> 12:38.265
God! No.

12:38.337 --> 12:39.804
Must stop.

12:39.872 --> 12:42.534
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop!

12:42.608 --> 12:44.667
Pain!

12:44.744 --> 12:47.042
Pain. Terrible pain.

12:47.113 --> 12:50.378
Um, the boy.

12:50.450 --> 12:53.715
Uh,Jim.

12:53.786 --> 12:57.051
Uh, he's tied with twine.

12:57.123 --> 12:59.489
Uh, packing twine.

13:01.461 --> 13:03.395
(Grunting)

13:09.902 --> 13:13.201
He whips them
with a coat hanger--

13:13.272 --> 13:15.240
a wire coat hanger.

13:17.310 --> 13:19.244
Oh.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.924
Dark place.

13:34.327 --> 13:36.295
Cold.

13:38.865 --> 13:40.799
A cellar.

13:42.635 --> 13:44.569
Warehouse, condemned.

13:51.010 --> 13:55.413
An angel ofstone.

13:56.682 --> 13:59.173
Waterfall.

13:59.252 --> 14:02.278
Water falling.

14:02.355 --> 14:05.119
Not a waterfall.
Not water.

14:08.227 --> 14:10.252
They're there.

14:15.034 --> 14:18.367
Oh, God.
I got to go.

14:18.437 --> 14:23.272
I got to go.
I got to go.

14:36.189 --> 14:40.888
I tore this off
my New York Knicks T-shirt.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.793
It has nothing to do
with the crime.

14:57.443 --> 15:03.348
* Somewhere beyond the sea *

15:04.984 --> 15:08.044
* Somewhere waiting for me *

15:13.893 --> 15:16.225
(Gasps)

15:19.732 --> 15:22.257
Did you get my message,
Starbuck?

15:30.009 --> 15:32.409
Scully, what's wrong?

15:34.313 --> 15:36.611
Did Boggs say something
toyou?

15:36.682 --> 15:39.742
No.

15:39.819 --> 15:42.845
It's my father.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:42.922 --> 15:44.685
That's all right.

15:44.757 --> 15:48.488
Why don'tyou go back
to the motel.

15:48.594 --> 15:50.687
We've exposed Boggs
as a fraud.

15:50.796 --> 15:53.264
Boggs is not what
he claims to be.

15:53.366 --> 15:55.300
He may be orchestrating
the kidnapping.

15:55.368 --> 15:59.498
Now he knows we're onto him. He
doesn't have a chance with the charade.

15:59.572 --> 16:02.268
I'm going to wait for a couple hours
and try to interrogate him.

16:02.341 --> 16:05.367
Hopefully, he'll tell me
where the kids are.

16:05.444 --> 16:08.538
* Somewhere *

16:08.614 --> 16:10.878
* Beyond the shore *

16:10.950 --> 16:13.783
*We'll kiss
just as before *

16:13.853 --> 16:17.220
* Happywe'll be **

16:31.337 --> 16:35.068
Water falling.
Not a waterfall.

16:43.015 --> 16:45.142
An angel ofstone.

18:17.643 --> 18:20.134
(Knock On Door)

18:20.212 --> 18:23.238
It's Mulder.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.880
I just heard that Liz Hawley's family
made a positive l.D.

18:30.956 --> 18:32.947
on the charm
you found at the warehouse.

18:33.025 --> 18:35.425
The police are searching
that place inch by inch

18:35.494 --> 18:38.054
but they haven't been able
to find anything yet.

18:39.498 --> 18:43.161
I expected to find you
at the crime scene.

18:43.235 --> 18:45.430
Did Boggs confess?

18:45.504 --> 18:50.567
No. No. It was five hours
of Boggs' channeling.

18:50.643 --> 18:53.976
After three hours I asked him
to summon up the soul ofJimi Hendrix

18:54.046 --> 18:57.072
and requested
"All Along The Watchtower."

18:57.183 --> 19:01.620
You know, the guy's been dead 20 years
but he still hasn't lost his edge.

19:01.687 --> 19:04.121
I lied to the police
about how I found the warehouse.

19:05.558 --> 19:09.221
I didn't notice
any suspicious activities.

19:09.295 --> 19:11.229
Then, how did you find it?

19:11.297 --> 19:14.460
It was where Boggs
said it would be.

19:14.533 --> 19:17.866
- Scully, I told you about Boggs.
- I didn't go looking for it.

19:17.937 --> 19:21.566
I came across an area that
had landmarks he spoke of--

19:21.640 --> 19:23.574
That's exactly
what Boggs wanted.

19:23.642 --> 19:28.079
He could have been setting you up.
You could be dead right now.

19:28.147 --> 19:32.106
Why did you feel you had to lie
on your police report?

19:32.184 --> 19:35.153
I thought it would be
a better explanation

19:35.254 --> 19:37.449
under the circumstances.

19:37.523 --> 19:39.616
No. You didn't want
to go on record

19:39.692 --> 19:41.751
admitting thatyou
believed in Boggs.

19:41.827 --> 19:44.625
The Bureau would expect something
like that from Spooky Mulder,

19:45.531 --> 19:47.021
but not Dana Scully.

19:50.069 --> 19:52.003
I thought
thatyou would be pleased

19:52.071 --> 19:55.507
that I'd opened myself
to extreme possibilities.

19:55.574 --> 19:57.405
Why now?

19:57.476 --> 19:59.637
After all we've seen, why Boggs?

20:05.751 --> 20:08.720
Does this have to do
with your father?

20:10.623 --> 20:13.456
He said that he didn't approve
ofyou becoming an FBI agent.

20:13.526 --> 20:16.256
Ifbeing on thejob now
makes you feel guilty

20:16.328 --> 20:20.458
or uncomfortable or uneasy
I thinkyou should back away.

20:21.934 --> 20:23.629
Because ifit's clouding
yourjudgment

20:23.702 --> 20:25.795
you're putting yourself
in danger.

20:26.972 --> 20:28.633
I love thisjob.

20:28.707 --> 20:30.436
You loveyour father.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.505
Dana...

20:37.850 --> 20:39.909
open yourselfup
to extreme possibilities

20:40.019 --> 20:42.044
onlywhen
they're the truth.

20:42.154 --> 20:45.885
That goes for Luther Boggs
and your father.

20:50.462 --> 20:52.555
As for Luther Boggs

20:52.631 --> 20:55.657
he's the greatest oflies.

20:55.734 --> 20:58.669
I know he's working
with someone on the outside

20:58.737 --> 21:01.399
and they planted that evidence.

21:01.473 --> 21:04.033
We have to be very careful
about plotting our next move

21:04.109 --> 21:07.169
because he's planned
five steps ahead.

21:07.246 --> 21:10.272
The only advantage
we have is time.

21:16.922 --> 21:19.322
Scully, look at this.

21:20.359 --> 21:23.624
That's incredible.
They found them?

21:23.696 --> 21:26.221
That's exactly
what I want Boggs to think.

21:26.298 --> 21:28.960
Why didn't the police
notify us?

21:29.034 --> 21:31.161
They haven't been found.
The article is bogus.

21:31.236 --> 21:32.931
The Carolinian
made this up for us.

21:33.005 --> 21:34.734
Only six people
know about it.

21:34.807 --> 21:38.334
Today Boggs gets
his weekly phone privileges.

21:38.410 --> 21:41.072
Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice
to find out what happened.

21:55.294 --> 21:57.854
Phone privilege is in two hours.

22:18.951 --> 22:21.545
(Boggs Dialing)

22:21.654 --> 22:24.020
Go.

22:27.926 --> 22:30.053
(Phone Rings)

22:30.129 --> 22:32.097
Turn offthat phone.

22:32.197 --> 22:33.858
- (Ringing)
- Turn it off.

22:33.966 --> 22:37.299
Mulder, it's you.

22:37.369 --> 22:39.200
(Ringing)

22:42.775 --> 22:45.642
- Mulder.
- How comeyou don't believe me?

22:46.745 --> 22:49.009
Agent Scully does.

22:49.081 --> 22:51.709
She believes me.

22:51.784 --> 22:54.651
Agent Scully believes
what we all believe--

22:54.720 --> 22:56.779
thatyou have the kids.

22:56.855 --> 22:58.982
Now, where are they?

23:05.497 --> 23:08.227
Mulder, even ifhe is
setting us up

23:08.333 --> 23:10.927
we have to follow,
because in three days--

23:11.036 --> 23:13.561
Liz Hawley andJim Summers
will be dead.

23:13.672 --> 23:15.902
Then a day later,
our only connection to the case

23:15.974 --> 23:19.410
will be pulling up a chair
at the gas chamber.

23:19.478 --> 23:21.742
We have to deal.

23:23.082 --> 23:26.643
(Breathing Heavily)

23:26.719 --> 23:30.519
The kidnapper is aroused
by the prospect ofbecoming a killer.

23:30.589 --> 23:32.853
What's the name?

23:33.926 --> 23:36.724
Can't see--
Male--

23:36.795 --> 23:39.525
Describe him.

23:39.631 --> 23:41.792
Small...

23:41.900 --> 23:44.892
thin...

23:45.003 --> 23:48.268
Iate twenties...

23:48.340 --> 23:51.935
skull...
human skull...

23:52.010 --> 23:53.875
silver gray.

23:53.946 --> 23:55.607
His eyes...

23:55.681 --> 23:58.241
cold... very cold...

23:58.317 --> 24:02.117
staring at Elizabeth.

24:03.388 --> 24:05.652
God, he's got the wire.

24:05.724 --> 24:07.123
No.

24:07.192 --> 24:09.820
Please... no.

24:16.034 --> 24:17.763
Where is he?

24:19.505 --> 24:22.838
He's over...

24:22.908 --> 24:24.808
by the window...

24:24.877 --> 24:27.175
holding back his...

24:27.246 --> 24:30.340
holding back his thoughts
ofkilling us...

24:33.085 --> 24:35.019
waiting.

24:36.455 --> 24:39.424
There's a small boathouse
on LakeJordan.

24:39.491 --> 24:41.425
You got that?

24:45.564 --> 24:47.657
Mulder.

24:47.766 --> 24:51.497
Don't go near
the white cross.

24:51.570 --> 24:54.937
We seeyou down...

24:55.007 --> 24:59.671
and your blood
spills on the white cross.

25:06.885 --> 25:09.115
(Muffed Cries)

25:30.642 --> 25:33.236
Sweep the docks!

25:54.132 --> 25:56.794
- Federal agent!
- (Gunshot)

25:56.902 --> 25:58.369
Mulder!

26:07.012 --> 26:10.209
We need an ambulance!
Officer down!

26:35.274 --> 26:37.367
What do we got?

26:37.442 --> 26:39.569
It's a through-and-through,
upper femur.

26:39.645 --> 26:41.237
Can't palpate
a radial pulse.

26:41.346 --> 26:44.577
Okay, I want a B.P.
Let's get him on the gurney.

26:44.683 --> 26:47.015
Nurse:
Blood pressure is 67 on palpation.

26:47.085 --> 26:49.053
Doctor:
Okay, tighten and screen him for six.

26:49.154 --> 26:51.418
I want two liters
ofsaline in now

26:51.490 --> 26:53.890
and give him two units
ofO-neg after the typing.

26:53.959 --> 26:56.951
Let's transfer now.

26:57.029 --> 26:59.122
Liz:
No.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.563
No.

27:05.904 --> 27:07.838
No.

27:16.181 --> 27:20.277
Man:
LucasJackson Henry, 28.

27:20.385 --> 27:22.376
Did some time at Angola
in Louisiana

27:22.487 --> 27:24.250
for sexual assault,
narcotics...

27:24.323 --> 27:26.348
nothing big, really.

27:26.425 --> 27:28.985
His personal history includes
being witness to an auto accident

27:29.061 --> 27:33.725
in which his high school sweetheart was
killed and his motherwas decapitated.

27:33.799 --> 27:35.733
The seven-year anniversary

27:35.801 --> 27:38.269
ofthat accident
is in three days.

27:38.337 --> 27:40.805
He's reliving it.

27:44.176 --> 27:46.667
That would explain the deadline.

27:46.745 --> 27:50.112
The most important element
we found is there's suspicion

27:50.215 --> 27:52.581
that Luther Lee Boggs'
last five murders

27:52.651 --> 27:54.744
were committed with a partner.

27:54.853 --> 27:58.289
Now, the police in Durham say
they could never prove it in court

27:58.357 --> 28:01.224
but they know that partner
was Lucas Henry.

28:09.835 --> 28:11.928
You set us up.

28:12.004 --> 28:14.370
You're in on this
with Lucas Henry.

28:14.439 --> 28:18.000
This was a trap for Mulder
because he helped putyou away.

28:18.076 --> 28:20.636
Well, I came here to tell you

28:20.746 --> 28:25.683
that ifhe dies because ofwhat
you've done, four days from now

28:25.784 --> 28:28.548
nobodywill stop me from being the one
that will throw the switch

28:28.620 --> 28:32.215
and gas you out ofthis life
for good, you son ofa bitch!

28:34.326 --> 28:35.918
Dana.

28:35.994 --> 28:37.894
You're the one that believed me.

28:39.231 --> 28:40.960
No.

28:41.033 --> 28:44.059
No, I do not believeyou!

28:46.138 --> 28:50.404
Ifyou don't believe me,
maybeyou'll believeyourself.

29:02.454 --> 29:07.187
There was that one time
when I was 1 4

29:07.259 --> 29:12.492
and my parents had gone to bed
and I snuck downstairs alone.

29:12.564 --> 29:14.930
Got one ofmy mom's cigarettes

29:15.000 --> 29:17.298
and went out
onto the porch in the dark.

29:17.369 --> 29:21.703
I was so scared.

29:21.773 --> 29:23.707
My heart was beating.

29:23.775 --> 29:25.868
Theywould have killed me
ifthey knew.

29:27.646 --> 29:30.945
But I was so excited.

29:31.049 --> 29:33.142
Not 'cause ofthe cigarette--

29:33.251 --> 29:35.185
it was gross--

29:35.253 --> 29:37.653
but because
I wasn't supposed to.

29:42.127 --> 29:45.255
That could be a moment
from any kid's life.

29:45.330 --> 29:47.696
I know whatyou want

29:47.766 --> 29:51.759
and I know who
you want to talk to.

29:51.837 --> 29:54.965
Why don'tyoujust go ahead
and ask me.

29:57.909 --> 30:00.742
I'll believeyou...

30:00.812 --> 30:05.442
ifyou let me talk to him.

30:38.450 --> 30:40.680
Starbuck...

30:55.767 --> 30:58.429
No, no, no!

30:58.503 --> 31:03.805
Nobody talks to anybody
until I get a deal.

31:06.511 --> 31:11.972
Don't underestimate
my fear ofdying

31:12.050 --> 31:16.953
and don't downplay my terror
ofgoing back to that chair.

31:17.022 --> 31:20.082
I know my hell's
going to be

31:20.158 --> 31:24.185
to go back to that chair
over and over again for all oftime

31:24.262 --> 31:28.460
but in this life--
my one and only life--

31:28.533 --> 31:32.833
I don't everwant to go
back again-- ever!

31:36.208 --> 31:38.642
The last time
I went to death's door

31:38.710 --> 31:40.974
and looked inside

31:41.046 --> 31:43.378
I had never talked
to a minister before

31:43.448 --> 31:47.885
in my life ever
until that day

31:47.953 --> 31:53.892
and he said,
" He who doth not love

31:53.959 --> 31:56.154
"remains in death.

31:56.261 --> 32:01.130
"And he who hates his brother
is a murderer

32:01.199 --> 32:03.258
"and no murderer
has eternal life

32:03.335 --> 32:05.565
abiding in him."

32:05.637 --> 32:11.542
My family, who I killed
after their last meal

32:11.610 --> 32:16.138
was right there to watch me
over mine

32:16.214 --> 32:20.344
and their fear

32:20.418 --> 32:22.716
and their horror

32:22.787 --> 32:26.883
that I made them feel
when I killed them

32:26.992 --> 32:29.927
was injected into me

32:29.995 --> 32:32.225
and their collective fear alone

32:32.297 --> 32:35.460
wasjust one taste ofhell.

32:39.437 --> 32:44.170
And I felt myself
leave my body.

32:44.242 --> 32:46.369
I thought they'd
already killed me.

32:46.444 --> 32:50.471
And I saw thousands

32:50.548 --> 32:54.780
ofsouls
rushing into my body.

32:59.491 --> 33:04.622
It is a cold,
dark place, Scully.

33:06.364 --> 33:10.300
Mulder's looking in
on it right now.

33:10.368 --> 33:14.498
It may be a cold,
dark place foryou

33:14.572 --> 33:19.202
but it's not for Mulder
and it's not for my father.

33:19.277 --> 33:22.269
I'm sure he'd like
to tell you hisself

33:22.347 --> 33:27.011
but I'm not going to let him.

33:27.085 --> 33:30.282
Nobody speaks
until you get me a deal.

33:32.023 --> 33:33.854
I don't believeyou.

33:33.958 --> 33:36.426
Oh, well, there's plenty ofroom

33:36.528 --> 33:40.589
in that cold, dark place
for liars, Scully.

33:42.334 --> 33:44.962
You go ahead and play it
likeyou need to

33:45.036 --> 33:47.402
but I knowyou believe me.

33:47.472 --> 33:51.499
But ifyou need to convince
ajudge I'm in on it with Lucas

33:51.576 --> 33:54.977
go ahead,
'cause eitherway--

33:55.046 --> 33:59.312
whether I'm running the show
with Lucas or I'm channeling--

33:59.384 --> 34:02.251
no information's coming
until I get a deal.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.915
I got nothing to lose.

34:09.494 --> 34:11.428
Guard!

34:13.431 --> 34:15.922
Ifl die

34:16.034 --> 34:20.664
that boy goes
to that cold, dark place.

34:47.232 --> 34:49.792
Man:
This Supreme Court

34:49.868 --> 34:52.837
will not make a deal
with a mass murderer.

34:52.904 --> 34:55.804
Especially one who I know
is orchestrating

34:55.873 --> 34:58.843
a capital offense two days
before his capital punishment.

34:58.910 --> 35:00.241
Yes, sir.

35:00.311 --> 35:03.508
The only thing Boggs
will get from me is a timely death.

35:03.581 --> 35:06.015
It's an overdue one at that.

35:12.323 --> 35:14.985
We're running out oftime.

35:15.093 --> 35:17.618
There's still no sign
of Lucas Henry

35:17.729 --> 35:20.994
orJim Summers.

35:21.065 --> 35:23.090
The Raleigh Police said--

35:23.168 --> 35:27.002
No matterwhat,
don't believe him.

35:27.071 --> 35:29.801
Boggs created this whole charade
to get back at me

35:29.874 --> 35:32.866
for putting him on death row.

35:35.180 --> 35:38.445
You'd be the next best thing.

35:38.516 --> 35:42.509
Mulder, I never thought
I'd say this...

35:42.587 --> 35:45.283
but what ifthere's
another explanation?

35:45.390 --> 35:50.384
Don't... deal with him.

35:50.495 --> 35:52.395
He could be trying
to claim you

35:52.464 --> 35:55.024
as his last victim.

36:11.583 --> 36:14.245
All right, Mr. Boggs...

36:14.319 --> 36:16.253
you gotyour deal.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.923
Thankyou, ma'am.

36:25.997 --> 36:28.295
Thankyou.

36:30.602 --> 36:34.003
All right, where are they?

36:36.341 --> 36:38.366
(Exhaling Loudly)

36:42.280 --> 36:45.272
Uh... I...

36:45.350 --> 36:48.478
uh...

36:48.553 --> 36:53.354
I see, like, uh...

36:53.458 --> 36:56.621
uh, circles.

36:56.728 --> 36:58.252
Uh...

36:58.363 --> 37:02.459
I don't know, like... barrels.

37:02.534 --> 37:04.559
No. No, bigger.

37:04.636 --> 37:06.627
Like, uh...

37:06.704 --> 37:10.868
huge, uh...
vats, uh--

37:12.343 --> 37:14.277
Factory.

37:14.345 --> 37:16.711
Uh, condemned.

37:16.781 --> 37:19.716
The old,

37:19.784 --> 37:23.345
uh, Blue Devil Brewery

37:23.421 --> 37:25.855
up by Morrisville.

37:27.358 --> 37:30.225
Oh, God, he's getting, uh...
he's getting ready.

37:30.295 --> 37:32.388
He-- He--

37:32.530 --> 37:34.760
He's getting ready to, um...

37:34.832 --> 37:37.266
um--

37:37.335 --> 37:40.964
He's getting ready
to kill the d--

37:41.039 --> 37:43.030
Whoo.

37:56.621 --> 37:58.612
Luther, ifyou really
were psychic--

37:58.723 --> 38:00.953
I would have known you lied.

38:01.059 --> 38:04.358
That there neverwas a deal.

38:04.429 --> 38:07.296
I knowyou tried.

38:13.605 --> 38:16.233
Scully.

38:16.307 --> 38:18.935
Avoid the devil.

38:19.010 --> 38:22.070
Don't follow Henry to the devil.

38:22.146 --> 38:24.910
Leave that to me.

38:31.155 --> 38:33.919
(Screaming)

38:37.028 --> 38:40.429
(Groaning)

38:46.904 --> 38:49.839
(Water Dripping)

39:04.856 --> 39:06.255
Agent:
Freeze!

39:06.357 --> 39:09.121
Federal agents.
We're armed!

39:10.228 --> 39:12.025
Dropyourweapon.

39:17.802 --> 39:19.497
(Gunshot)

39:34.819 --> 39:37.549
(Heaving)

39:41.826 --> 39:43.760
Go!

39:44.796 --> 39:46.730
Ow!

39:46.798 --> 39:49.062
(Grunting)

40:51.395 --> 40:53.590
You come to say good-bye?

40:56.234 --> 40:58.293
I believe...

41:01.072 --> 41:06.408
that ifyou had orchestrated
this kidnapping

41:06.477 --> 41:10.413
Lucas Henrywould have
been aware ofthe danger

41:10.515 --> 41:12.483
you warned me about.

41:14.085 --> 41:16.451
He neverwould have
crossed that bridge.

41:19.924 --> 41:24.588
Soyou saved
jim Summers' life.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.525
Butyou saved mine as well.

41:44.515 --> 41:47.678
You come for some
unfinished business.

41:49.587 --> 41:51.521
You want
your father's message.

41:54.258 --> 41:56.055
Not now.

41:56.127 --> 41:58.527
Be there tonight.

41:58.596 --> 42:01.724
Mywitness.

42:01.799 --> 42:06.168
And when they got me
in that chair and they...

42:06.237 --> 42:08.762
open up that shield...

42:11.809 --> 42:14.778
you getyour message.

43:11.702 --> 43:14.637
(Breathing Heavily)

43:22.947 --> 43:26.781
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy Name.

43:26.884 --> 43:30.820
Thy Kingdom come, Thywill be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven...

43:30.888 --> 43:33.686
Would you like
to make a statement?

43:33.758 --> 43:35.692
And forgive us
our trespasses

43:35.760 --> 43:38.024
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

43:38.095 --> 43:41.496
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

43:41.565 --> 43:46.002
ForThine is the Kingdom,
the power and the glory

43:46.070 --> 43:48.732
forever and ever, amen.

44:01.352 --> 44:04.879
I was considering Boggs.

44:04.989 --> 44:08.288
Ifhe knew that I was
your partner

44:08.359 --> 44:11.522
he could have found out everything
he knew about me-- about my father.

44:11.595 --> 44:13.222
Scully--

44:13.297 --> 44:16.460
" Beyond the Sea" was playing
at my parents' wedding.

44:16.534 --> 44:20.595
Visions ofdeceased loved ones
are a common psychological phenomena.

44:20.671 --> 44:24.266
- Ifhe knew that my father--
- Dana...

44:24.342 --> 44:29.075
after all you've seen,
after all the evidence

44:29.146 --> 44:31.376
why can'tyou believe?

44:39.323 --> 44:41.587
I'm afraid.

44:43.894 --> 44:45.885
I'm afraid to believe.

44:47.164 --> 44:50.497
You couldn't face that fear?

44:50.568 --> 44:53.833
Even ifit meant never knowing
whatyour fatherwanted to tell you?

44:56.574 --> 44:58.735
But I do know.

44:59.810 --> 45:01.778
How?

45:05.850 --> 45:07.784
He was my father.
