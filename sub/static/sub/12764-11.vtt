00:00.148 --> 00:01.984
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.402 --> 00:04.194
- You're Kyle.
- You're in my tub.

00:04.314 --> 00:07.197
The creep who did this stole the
necklace Declan gave me, I want it back.

00:08.558 --> 00:10.735
- What is it?
- It's my necklace that was stolen.

00:10.917 --> 00:12.536
Just so you know, Kyle is with me.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.287
It's not supposed to be that way.

00:14.422 --> 00:15.565
<i>You came back for me.</i>

00:15.688 --> 00:17.988
<i>When you reached out
for me and took my hand,</i>

00:18.123 --> 00:20.177
<i>for the first time I didn't feel alone.</i>

00:21.672 --> 00:23.463
<i>Say something if you're okay.</i>

00:25.520 --> 00:26.633
Andy has cancer.

00:26.753 --> 00:28.135
Josh, I am so sorry.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.221
I want to help her, but she won't
let me talk to her about it.

00:32.259 --> 00:34.308
<i>- What's wrong?
- Have you an affair with Emily?</i>

00:36.636 --> 00:38.604
Did someone teach you to draw that way?

00:42.012 --> 00:43.058
This is Baylin's.

00:43.562 --> 00:46.028
- I can't get it open.
- We'll figure it out.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.447
Kyle, I'd like
to introduce you to Cerebral

00:48.567 --> 00:49.948
Impulse Relay, or

00:50.068 --> 00:51.068
C.I.R.

00:51.794 --> 00:53.181
But we like to call it CIR.

00:53.822 --> 00:56.137
To Stephen and your wonderful family.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.874
Ballantine invaded my home,
my family, and my privacy.

00:58.994 --> 01:01.376
- So what do you want to do?
- I want to get my ring back.

01:03.957 --> 01:06.048
- We're not leaving you.
- Now listen to me.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.884
- The ring is all you need.
- What?

01:09.182 --> 01:10.239
Now go.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.637
- Thank you.
- Get out of here!

01:12.096 --> 01:13.472
Take him to room 237.

<i>While discovering who
I am and where I came from,</i>

01:26.673 --> 01:30.042
<i>I'd always been led to believe I was
the only person in the world like me.</i>

01:31.222 --> 01:33.644
<i>Now it seemed Jessi
and I had a connection,</i>

01:34.198 --> 01:36.084
<i>but I wasn't sure how to figure it out.</i>

01:39.807 --> 01:41.375
<i>"The light will show you the way."</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.214
<i>- It's Foss.
- Are you okay?</i>

01:47.807 --> 01:50.133
- I've had to lay low.
- What happened? Where are you?

01:50.467 --> 01:52.347
I'll let you know
when it's safe to meet.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.513
<i>- I better go.
- Wait...</i>

01:56.052 --> 01:57.975
Thank you, Tom. I appreciate your help.

02:01.253 --> 02:02.324
Nice car.

02:02.495 --> 02:05.023
Yeah, not bad, as environmentally
conscious vehicles go,

02:05.421 --> 02:08.651
but is it worth wasting a day standing
around with my hand planted on it?

02:09.305 --> 02:11.238
Your name does have to be drawn first.

02:12.539 --> 02:13.830
Highly unlikely.

02:13.990 --> 02:17.119
Wouldn't last 5 minutes in the contest.
You've the attention span of a bird.

02:17.464 --> 02:19.288
Not when I'm properly motivated.

02:20.283 --> 02:22.457
I hope your motivation
would be to cancer charity.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.699
Why would I care about that?

02:28.691 --> 02:30.340
To help people with cancer?

02:32.160 --> 02:33.160
Whatever.

02:35.871 --> 02:38.557
Well, I hope something happens
at this shindig for Hillary's

02:38.677 --> 02:39.808
- sake.
- Hillary?

02:40.069 --> 02:42.227
She's set her sights on
becoming the next reality

02:42.347 --> 02:43.388
TV star.

02:44.273 --> 02:46.481
I think she's looking at
this as her walking audition.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.018
You think Jessi will be there today?

02:51.354 --> 02:54.197
Are you asking me as
my mom or her therapist?

02:55.068 --> 02:56.237
I guess both.

02:57.817 --> 02:59.369
Is she still spending time with you?

03:00.466 --> 03:02.664
Invited or not,
she just seems to show up.

03:03.343 --> 03:05.951
And let's just say she's taken
a particular interest

03:06.071 --> 03:07.836
in Kyle as of late.

03:14.181 --> 03:16.172
Is it time to go to the charity event?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.297
Everyone's still getting ready.

03:19.386 --> 03:20.397
What's wrong?

03:20.954 --> 03:22.626
Nothing. I just...

03:22.911 --> 03:24.557
I wanted to ask you about something.

03:25.227 --> 03:27.113
How well do you know Jessi Hollander?

03:28.786 --> 03:29.812
Not that well.

03:30.729 --> 03:32.402
Has she ever seen any of your drawings?

03:34.325 --> 03:35.655
Not that I'm aware of.

03:37.177 --> 03:38.970
When you recovered your memory,

03:39.686 --> 03:42.079
did you ever figure out
the meaning of that symbol?

03:43.283 --> 03:44.804
The one you kept drawing?

03:47.388 --> 03:49.586
It was a logo for
a company Adam Baylin started.

03:51.017 --> 03:54.257
But it's not around anymore.
What does that have to do with Jessi?

03:56.261 --> 03:58.387
Just trying to get
some things clear in my head.

04:01.736 --> 04:03.016
I know how that can be.

04:06.035 --> 04:07.521
We should get to the carnival.

04:08.764 --> 04:09.940
I'm almost ready.

04:11.111 --> 04:12.776
I'll go ring the warning bell.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.548
<i>If Jessi and I did share a history,</i>

04:20.771 --> 04:23.844
<i>I knew I had to understand
it before anyone else did.</i>

04:30.865 --> 04:33.535
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 11:
Hands On A Hybrid</font>

04:38.633 --> 04:41.553
<i>I hope you're all wearing comfortable
shoes because today's raffle is for</i>

04:41.676 --> 04:44.671
<i>a chance to participate in
the "Hands on a Hybrid" challenge.</i>

04:45.180 --> 04:48.028
<i>One lucky person with enough stamina
is going to drive away with</i>

04:48.155 --> 04:50.140
<i>a state-of-the-art vehicle tonight.</i>

04:50.492 --> 04:52.719
<i>Your contribution goes
directly to cancer research,</i>

04:52.839 --> 04:55.485
<i>and your reward is a fantastic new car.</i>

04:55.711 --> 04:58.613
<i>Buy your tickets now.
The drawing begins in less than an hour.</i>

04:58.733 --> 05:01.521
This thing is way cuter
than in the commercials.

05:02.554 --> 05:03.932
I mean, not that cute matters.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.143
It's good to be green, right?

05:07.933 --> 05:11.126
So, I haven't seen you since that night

05:11.246 --> 05:12.246
we went into the woods.

05:12.831 --> 05:15.482
I know you were kind
of tripped out on all the gas, but

05:15.617 --> 05:17.716
it was kind of
a weird night for everyone.

05:17.836 --> 05:18.758
Is Kyle here?

05:19.773 --> 05:21.428
He's around here somewhere.

05:23.476 --> 05:26.183
- You got your necklace back.
- Yeah. It just showed up

05:26.303 --> 05:28.685
in my locker. Some screwed-up
stalker was trying

05:28.805 --> 05:30.061
to play mind games with me.

05:31.958 --> 05:34.107
Maybe someone found it
and was just trying to be nice.

05:37.352 --> 05:39.821
I just thought that you
would be glad to have it back.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.707
I'd rather not haveb been beaten down

05:42.827 --> 05:45.089
and robbed in the first place, but...

05:46.078 --> 05:49.598
kind of puts a damper
on the whole glad thing.

05:50.544 --> 05:52.371
Catch you later. Freak.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.589
Crap. Andy's here. Remember,

05:57.709 --> 06:01.301
not a word. In fact, don't even use
words that start with the letter C.

06:02.102 --> 06:03.845
If she finds out I told you
she has cancer,

06:04.091 --> 06:05.388
I'm a corpse.

06:06.471 --> 06:07.933
I mean, a dead guy.

06:08.053 --> 06:09.684
Keep breathing. I won't speak at all.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.022
Oh, and, Mom...

06:15.157 --> 06:16.190
thanks.

06:24.943 --> 06:26.213
I thought you weren't coming.

06:26.518 --> 06:27.612
My moms made me.

06:27.735 --> 06:30.093
Like some cancer charity
party's going to inspire me.

06:31.493 --> 06:33.112
God, look at that.

06:34.331 --> 06:35.972
Complete, utter fakeness.

06:37.173 --> 06:38.987
Happy-go-lucky kids with cancer.

06:39.144 --> 06:40.173
Come on.

06:42.066 --> 06:43.517
"You give, we live?"

06:44.031 --> 06:45.053
How lame.

06:48.999 --> 06:50.767
Not I don't support people with cancer.

06:51.163 --> 06:54.312
- Totally down for the cause.
- Screw the cause, just give me the car.

06:56.893 --> 06:58.565
<i>All right, mix it up, girl.</i>

06:58.877 --> 07:00.226
<i>Okay, people, gather 'round.</i>

07:00.367 --> 07:03.040
<i>It's time to see who's going
to get their shot at winning a hybrid.</i>

07:03.163 --> 07:05.156
<i>4,000 entries,
but only 20 lucky winners.</i>

07:05.573 --> 07:06.782
I talked to Foss.

07:07.648 --> 07:10.385
He's okay,
but he said it's not safe to meet yet.

07:11.462 --> 07:14.249
- Did you tell him about the picture?
- I didn't get a chance.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.626
But I've been thinking,
that picture has been locked

07:17.762 --> 07:19.654
in Adam's box for 15 years.

07:19.828 --> 07:21.924
That has to be him in the photo.

07:22.597 --> 07:25.498
- What about the girl?
- Maybe Adam had a female counterpart.

07:27.112 --> 07:28.305
Maybe Jessi's like me.

07:28.835 --> 07:30.822
Jessi had a life before she moved here.

07:31.116 --> 07:33.781
- Full-on memories.
- She could be lying.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.395
So Madacorp sent some wicked hot,

07:36.528 --> 07:39.055
mentally scrambled science
experiment to invade your life.

07:40.023 --> 07:41.117
Why?

07:41.375 --> 07:43.695
Then why haven't they made
some move on you by now?

07:45.062 --> 07:46.063
I don't know.

07:47.069 --> 07:49.725
It's like they've been watching...
waiting.

07:50.452 --> 07:51.453
Should I go green?

07:51.973 --> 07:53.538
Isn't that something?

07:55.724 --> 07:58.218
Our fifth contestant is...

08:03.114 --> 08:04.549
<i>Give it up for Kyle!</i>

08:05.241 --> 08:07.719
I can't do this. What if Foss calls?
I need to talk to him.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.675
Either way, you stand around waiting.

08:09.795 --> 08:11.264
<i>All right, we'll go yellow this time.</i>

08:11.806 --> 08:13.350
<i>Contestant number 6...</i>

08:17.265 --> 08:18.534
<i>Give it up for Jessi!</i>

08:20.608 --> 08:23.568
- What are the odds of that happening?
- 20 in 4,000.

08:24.262 --> 08:26.465
Whatever. Look, here's your chance.

08:26.614 --> 08:28.573
Get her talking,
figure out if she's lying.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.227
<i>I think it'll be good.</i>

08:31.603 --> 08:32.638
<i>It's kind of tough.</i>

08:32.758 --> 08:34.207
<i>I'll be standing there for so long.</i>

08:34.562 --> 08:35.986
<i>I got a good chance.</i>

08:38.258 --> 08:39.270
Congrats, man.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.628
- You must be really psyched.
- Kinda, yeah.

08:42.317 --> 08:44.027
You trying to win the car for your girl?

08:46.564 --> 08:48.760
Hadn't really thought it
through that far, had you?

08:49.257 --> 08:50.442
Let me cut to the chase.

08:51.149 --> 08:54.069
I once played video
games for 17 hours straight...

08:54.687 --> 08:56.843
no food, no water, no bathroom.

08:57.413 --> 09:00.230
When I put my mind to something,
I make it happen.

09:00.575 --> 09:02.635
So name your price, man.
Because tonight,

09:03.063 --> 09:06.979
I put my mind towards winning that
car for the lady I want to be my lady.

09:08.245 --> 09:09.989
Long story,
but she kind of needs the boost.

09:12.697 --> 09:13.766
A hundred bucks.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.451
Dude.

09:15.696 --> 09:19.040
I might be a romantic, but I'm
a part-time, minimum-wage romantic.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.909
<i>All right, beautiful people, listen up.</i>

09:21.378 --> 09:23.253
<i>We're going to have rules
in this competion.</i>

09:24.174 --> 09:25.219
<i>Number 1:</i>

09:25.354 --> 09:28.800
<i>contestants must have one
hand on the car at all times.</i>

09:29.378 --> 09:30.429
<i>Number 2:</i>

09:30.549 --> 09:31.970
<i>no sitting, kneeling,</i>

09:32.232 --> 09:34.081
<i>lounging, or leaning.</i>

09:34.901 --> 09:35.996
<i>Number 3:</i>

09:36.439 --> 09:39.394
<i>last but not least, last person standing</i>

09:40.165 --> 09:41.896
<i>gets to drive this hybrid home tonight.</i>

09:42.329 --> 09:43.583
Move over, bro.

09:43.722 --> 09:46.151
- This baby's mine.
- I didn't hear your name called.

09:46.751 --> 09:50.071
Some guy dropped out at the last minute.
Guess it's my lucky day.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.783
<i>All, right. That about covers it.</i>

09:53.434 --> 09:57.098
<i>So, I guess the only
thing left to say is...</i>

09:57.873 --> 09:59.010
<i>contestants...</i>

09:59.704 --> 10:00.736
<i>get ready...</i>

10:01.614 --> 10:02.615
<i>get set...</i>

10:04.413 --> 10:05.962
put your hands on the hybrid, y'all.

10:14.591 --> 10:15.805
<i>This was the opportunity</i>

10:15.925 --> 10:17.348
<i>I'd been looking for.</i>

10:17.468 --> 10:19.559
<i>But how would I find out
the truth about her?</i>

10:27.474 --> 10:30.153
So, give me the super-genius
lowdown on the competion.

10:32.942 --> 10:34.073
See the guy in the red shirt?

10:35.082 --> 10:36.618
He's nervous. His heart beats fast.

10:36.738 --> 10:38.495
He's a real contender.

10:41.838 --> 10:43.833
And her, she's wearing the wrong shoes.

10:45.341 --> 10:46.673
I give her an hour.

10:49.350 --> 10:50.215
What about him?

10:51.090 --> 10:52.634
Allergies. Ten minutes, tops.

10:54.343 --> 10:55.344
And...

11:00.109 --> 11:02.277
I don't know. She's hard to read.

11:07.602 --> 11:08.775
We got this in the bag.

11:10.053 --> 11:11.592
You already have a car.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.989
I'm a man of many needs.

11:21.194 --> 11:23.860
Did you notice how our son magically
ended up in the contest?

11:24.157 --> 11:25.500
I don't think that was magic.

11:25.841 --> 11:27.335
It's obvious he cheated.

11:32.182 --> 11:33.506
It's Ballantine.

11:34.756 --> 11:35.763
Hello.

11:36.255 --> 11:37.633
Yes. Today?

11:38.723 --> 11:39.842
But I'm...

11:41.290 --> 11:42.392
No. No, I understand.

11:42.512 --> 11:43.638
I'll see you soon.

11:44.549 --> 11:47.146
This is the first family weekend
we've had in a month.

11:47.267 --> 11:48.314
Yeah, I know, but it's

11:48.434 --> 11:49.482
a last-minute thing.

11:50.699 --> 11:51.966
I should be done by dinner.

11:55.567 --> 11:56.570
Bye.

11:57.535 --> 11:58.790
See you later, Lori.

11:59.761 --> 12:00.827
Yeah, bye.

12:05.373 --> 12:07.542
Okay, what is up with you two?

12:08.436 --> 12:09.436
Nothing.

12:09.716 --> 12:12.755
Right. You're in your Lori Trager
cone of silence.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.674
I just don't feel like talking.

12:16.154 --> 12:18.854
Look, if there's something
between you and your father,

12:18.974 --> 12:21.288
you don't have to tell me,
but I think you're mature enough

12:21.408 --> 12:24.142
to let go of your grudge
and just work it through.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.343
Mom, it's not a grudge, it's...

12:30.714 --> 12:33.693
Dad's just been working a lot lately,
and I guess I'm letting it get to me.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.370
<i>One hour in, and they're</i>

12:44.492 --> 12:46.809
<i>dropping like flies!
Where's the stamina?</i>

12:46.932 --> 12:49.689
<i>This competion is about sticking it out
until the bitter end.</i>

12:49.810 --> 12:52.719
<i>Last year's winner held on
for a jaw-dropping 18 hours.</i>

12:52.840 --> 12:54.923
Looks like our chances
of winning are getting better.

12:55.627 --> 12:56.633
It looks like.

12:57.498 --> 12:58.509
Don't you want to win?

12:59.493 --> 13:00.637
Not really.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.681
Then why would you stand
around here for hours?

13:04.667 --> 13:05.669
To help people?

13:05.789 --> 13:06.851
For the charity?

13:08.887 --> 13:10.939
I don't understand you at all.

13:12.563 --> 13:14.021
I could say the same about you.

13:17.236 --> 13:18.571
What would you do if you won?

13:20.731 --> 13:22.195
I don't know. I'd just...

13:22.404 --> 13:23.449
drive.

13:25.157 --> 13:26.214
Where?

13:27.284 --> 13:28.514
Anywhere else.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.211
Don't you ever just want to get away?

13:35.649 --> 13:36.917
I was away once.

13:38.079 --> 13:40.093
And all I wanted was
to come back to my family.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.347
Family's not all it's cracked up to be.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.184
What do you mean?

13:51.885 --> 13:52.899
Well, you have...

13:53.436 --> 13:54.482
so many people here

13:54.602 --> 13:55.614
supporting you.

13:55.900 --> 13:56.693
And...

13:56.971 --> 13:59.179
My sister's the only person
I have in my life,

13:59.299 --> 14:00.647
but she didn't come.

14:02.115 --> 14:03.867
I'm sure there's a reason.

14:05.307 --> 14:06.661
It's not just today. It's...

14:09.541 --> 14:11.558
I don't know, something
about our life just...

14:12.522 --> 14:13.863
feels wrong.

14:23.147 --> 14:24.549
What are you doing here?

14:24.721 --> 14:27.138
Apparently, the systems integration test
was so successful,

14:27.258 --> 14:28.891
they wanna move immediately into trials.

14:29.922 --> 14:31.144
- Today?
- Tell me about it.

14:31.557 --> 14:34.201
It's happening faster
than I can train my entire staff.

14:34.336 --> 14:36.899
For now I'm the only one who can
babysit the diagnostic software.

14:38.323 --> 14:41.362
Well, I'm sure Ballantine
is grateful for your expertise.

14:42.809 --> 14:45.447
Emily, listen, about the test today,
I'm just a little concerned.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.660
How did they find a subject
on such short notice?

14:49.175 --> 14:52.623
Stats analysis has been compiling
a test pool for months.

14:53.551 --> 14:55.912
We don't wanna be
stuck here all day, right?

14:56.035 --> 14:58.080
- I better leave you to it.
- All right.

14:58.368 --> 14:59.848
<i>Four hours and counting, people!</i>

15:00.261 --> 15:01.268
<i>Keep it up!</i>

15:01.674 --> 15:03.283
<i>That's the fighting spirit.</i>

15:03.407 --> 15:05.754
<i>Ignore the pain in your feet
and the aches in your brain,</i>

15:05.892 --> 15:07.263
<i>and keep up the good work.</i>

15:08.009 --> 15:11.631
<i>Hour six. And I can see that a few
of you are in this for the long haul.</i>

15:11.950 --> 15:12.977
Sure you're not tired?

15:14.634 --> 15:15.654
I'm sure.

15:16.730 --> 15:17.773
Not the

15:17.893 --> 15:19.192
slighest bit sleepy?

15:19.312 --> 15:20.109
I mean,

15:20.356 --> 15:21.360
we've been at this for...

15:21.480 --> 15:22.480
hours.

15:23.437 --> 15:26.180
Be so nice to relax, have a seat,

15:27.458 --> 15:28.823
maybe have a nap.

15:37.764 --> 15:38.932
You're staring.

15:40.199 --> 15:41.339
I guess so.

15:41.891 --> 15:42.894
Why?

15:46.161 --> 15:48.221
I want to understand
why you think the way you do.

15:49.234 --> 15:50.898
You don't want to get inside my head.

15:51.021 --> 15:54.143
It's a scary place.
Why else would I be in therapy?

16:01.075 --> 16:03.820
Nicole's really nice,
but I like talking to you better.

16:04.796 --> 16:05.655
You do?

16:07.059 --> 16:08.251
I don't know...

16:08.963 --> 16:10.952
it's just easier than
talking to other people.

16:12.273 --> 16:14.163
- Like we're...
- Connected somehow.

16:14.496 --> 16:15.498
Yeah.

16:19.762 --> 16:20.670
Like

16:20.949 --> 16:23.115
what I said earlier about my sister.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.092
I've never told anybody that before.

16:26.523 --> 16:27.827
Not even Nicole?

16:29.068 --> 16:31.722
I don't think Nicole would understand
the things that are going on.

16:33.777 --> 16:34.809
Maybe I could.

16:45.261 --> 16:46.933
When we went to the woods...

16:47.732 --> 16:49.490
I saw some things that scared me.

16:50.819 --> 16:52.759
Things that I think I did

16:52.879 --> 16:54.704
but don't remember doing.

16:56.822 --> 16:58.291
What kind of things?

17:04.085 --> 17:05.089
It's okay.

17:05.209 --> 17:06.214
You can tell me.

17:12.383 --> 17:13.472
What was that?

17:16.483 --> 17:17.894
Uh, what do you mean?

17:19.553 --> 17:21.848
- I saw a fire.
- You... You saw that?

17:22.638 --> 17:23.659
How?

17:24.852 --> 17:26.319
I think I just read your mind.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.876
You just read my mind?

17:34.447 --> 17:35.745
That's not possible.

17:37.562 --> 17:40.583
I don't know how, but...
I think I saw what you were thinking...

17:41.349 --> 17:42.667
or rembering.

17:43.538 --> 17:45.693
No. People can't do that.

17:46.063 --> 17:48.090
Do you ever feel like
you're not like other people?

17:49.355 --> 17:51.093
I do sometimes.

17:53.417 --> 17:55.988
Look, I'm really freaked out
right now, so...

17:56.513 --> 17:57.767
please just stay away.

18:10.058 --> 18:11.064
I thought you were coming.

18:11.363 --> 18:13.199
<i>Nope. Too busy being painfully</i>

18:13.319 --> 18:14.519
indecisive about New York.

18:15.139 --> 18:16.869
Why? Is the event that much fun?

18:17.639 --> 18:20.503
If your idea of fun is watching
Kyle and Jessi standing around a car

18:20.651 --> 18:21.707
staring at each other.

18:22.292 --> 18:23.621
They're both in the contest?

18:23.849 --> 18:26.671
<i>Yeah. And after everything
that's happened with her, I'm not so</i>

18:26.791 --> 18:28.839
psyched about her
standing that close to him.

18:29.943 --> 18:30.883
Is it that bad?

18:32.426 --> 18:34.585
First of all,
Kyle hasn't done anything wrong.

18:34.705 --> 18:36.013
And we both know he won't.

18:36.717 --> 18:39.267
<i>But I saw the way she looks at him,
I know you don't know me well</i>

18:39.387 --> 18:41.459
enough to decipher
my melodramatic tendencies,

18:41.579 --> 18:44.313
but I'm telling you,
put on your best flower-print dress

18:44.685 --> 18:47.427
<i>and supportive girlfriend smile,
get your ass down here,</i>

18:47.550 --> 18:49.193
<i>and show that boyfriend-stealer up.</i>

18:51.544 --> 18:53.167
With five contestants remaing,

18:53.303 --> 18:56.450
the question
on everyone's mind is, who's hot,

18:57.212 --> 18:58.244
and who's not?

18:58.364 --> 18:59.619
I'm not even joking here.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.025
Come on. This is supposed to be fun.

19:02.198 --> 19:03.836
I'm aiming for a reality TV career,

19:03.958 --> 19:05.512
not the 11:00 news.

19:05.632 --> 19:06.460
Take five.

19:06.885 --> 19:07.889
All right.

19:08.012 --> 19:10.368
How is this supposed
to get you your 15 minutes?

19:10.611 --> 19:11.546
Honestly,

19:11.666 --> 19:13.039
it's a lot harder than I thought.

19:13.504 --> 19:16.316
Right now, I'm just kinda running amuck
and looking fabulous.

19:16.547 --> 19:17.816
I need an angle.

19:18.136 --> 19:19.280
Go tabloid.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.472
Dig up some dirt
on some of the contestants.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.227
You should start with Jessi.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.612
I tried to get a comment from her
during one of the breaks.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.334
Stiff as a board in front of the camera.

19:28.469 --> 19:30.331
Kind of crazy in the eyes.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.858
Dig deeper. There's definitely something
about her that we're missing.

19:34.287 --> 19:35.654
- Now you got me curious.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.743
- Why her?
- Because....

19:39.417 --> 19:41.910
First she's all about Declan,
then all of a sudden she's, like,

19:42.030 --> 19:44.447
suddenly mesmerized by Kyle.
I mean, what is that?

19:44.569 --> 19:46.375
She's erratic and moody, and...
Oh, yeah.

19:46.495 --> 19:48.252
Remember the fit she threw at the dance?

19:49.238 --> 19:51.033
Clearly, she bugs.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.049
But why get so aggravated?

19:53.935 --> 19:56.992
It's just... She's all hunkered down
in the middle of our lives

19:57.112 --> 19:58.800
and we know this much about her.

19:59.263 --> 20:02.099
Can you honestly think of one normal,
decent thing to say about Jessi?

20:04.387 --> 20:05.624
You're right.

20:06.337 --> 20:09.153
She's just a mystery
waiting to become a scandal.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.441
I'm on it.

20:10.561 --> 20:12.443
You'd have a career.
You're great at gossip.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.429
Think when there's a camera involved

20:14.552 --> 20:16.906
it's called investigative journalism.

20:17.453 --> 20:19.215
<i>How many of you are feeling tired?</i>

20:19.350 --> 20:21.660
<i>Better not see any yawns.
The party's just getting started.</i>

20:25.067 --> 20:26.199
Hey, Andy.

20:26.617 --> 20:27.883
Hey, Ms. Trager.

20:31.491 --> 20:32.505
My God! He totally

20:32.625 --> 20:33.672
told you?

20:36.181 --> 20:37.802
Covering for Josh, I get it.

20:38.394 --> 20:39.428
But that doesn't let him

20:39.548 --> 20:41.806
off the hook for flapping
his yapper in the first place.

20:42.870 --> 20:43.891
How are you?

20:44.395 --> 20:45.624
Are you gonna bill me?

20:45.760 --> 20:47.186
Consider it a freebie.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.510
Well...

20:50.932 --> 20:53.776
me and my moms have been
through this before, so I can deal.

20:55.174 --> 20:56.195
Look...

20:57.080 --> 20:58.690
you seem very well equipped

20:59.046 --> 21:00.825
for what's coming, but

21:00.945 --> 21:03.202
when someone who really
cares about you isn't...

21:06.699 --> 21:07.720
Slack.

21:07.843 --> 21:09.510
Cutting him some. Now.

21:11.830 --> 21:12.847
Thanks.

21:13.265 --> 21:14.547
You're really good.

21:15.982 --> 21:17.900
Well, I only did half the work.

21:18.908 --> 21:21.994
With your coping skills, I assume
one of your moms is a therapist?

21:22.412 --> 21:24.890
Nope. They're just a couple
of everyday lesbians.

21:26.876 --> 21:27.921
Thank you.

21:36.466 --> 21:37.720
- You came.
- Of course.

21:37.843 --> 21:39.761
Every winner needs a cheering section.

21:40.904 --> 21:42.992
- How you holding up?
- I feel good.

21:43.448 --> 21:45.369
I packed you a survival kit:

21:45.489 --> 21:46.787
energy drinks, power bars,

21:46.907 --> 21:48.732
those little Band-Aids for blisters.

21:49.445 --> 21:51.118
and you favorite, Sour Patch Kids.

21:51.997 --> 21:53.919
Thank you. This is great.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.574
You know,

21:55.708 --> 21:57.133
if you get bored just waiting...

21:57.253 --> 22:00.176
I'll be here as long as you're
still in the contest.

22:09.384 --> 22:11.145
<i>Now that I knew I could
see her memories,</i>

22:12.089 --> 22:15.113
<i>I hoped I hadn't lost my chance
to break through to her.</i>

22:22.712 --> 22:25.146
Operation Supportive
Girlfriend underway.

22:25.324 --> 22:27.925
- Nicely done.
- I feel kind of juvenile.

22:28.359 --> 22:29.413
My middle name.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.949
Listen, I didn't mean
to get you worried, but

22:32.072 --> 22:33.904
you might be leaving
for an entire semester,

22:34.039 --> 22:36.879
I don't want her thinking she can
swoop in and take whatever she wants.

22:37.759 --> 22:39.048
Like she did with you and Declan?

22:40.699 --> 22:41.467
Yeah.

22:42.227 --> 22:43.219
And don't think

22:43.339 --> 22:46.677
I'm not aware I'm projecting my
annoyance about that on your situation.

22:46.813 --> 22:48.182
It's fine. I totally get it.

22:49.574 --> 22:50.782
Does believing that

22:50.902 --> 22:53.688
Kyle won't get sucked in
by her make me a lame, clueless girl?

22:54.513 --> 22:57.525
Because I've already been that, and
I don't think I'd go through it again.

22:57.837 --> 23:01.046
Believe me, if I thought
you were lame and/or clueless,

23:01.563 --> 23:03.781
this whole friend thing
wouldn't even happen.

23:06.255 --> 23:08.616
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna be
outta here before dinner.

23:08.751 --> 23:10.386
The boys are still hanging in there.

23:11.141 --> 23:12.309
Good for them.

23:12.936 --> 23:15.543
Listen, I have a question.
You've run some clinical trials.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.825
Back in grad school.

23:18.850 --> 23:21.090
How long does it take
to gather a pool of test subjects?

23:21.715 --> 23:24.099
Well, usually as soon as
the parameters are established,

23:24.235 --> 23:25.895
test subjects can be
screened and approved

23:26.030 --> 23:27.555
in a matter of weeks. Why?

23:28.328 --> 23:31.722
Well, turns out we're running a test
with a real subject today.

23:31.885 --> 23:33.591
Kinda took me by surprise.

23:34.549 --> 23:35.813
Emily said not to worry.

23:36.713 --> 23:38.816
<i>- Oh, Emily is there, too?
- Yeah.</i>

23:38.936 --> 23:41.235
Why don't I pick up some food
and bring it on down later?

23:41.980 --> 23:43.112
Sounds good.

23:43.573 --> 23:44.619
Okay. Bye.

23:51.836 --> 23:53.361
Where'd you go to high school?

23:54.037 --> 23:56.311
What is that? Is it a lie detector?

23:57.922 --> 24:00.838
Just make it easier on yourself.
Answer the questions.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.633
I went to high school in Phoenix...

24:06.050 --> 24:06.844
Chicago...

24:08.964 --> 24:09.997
D.C.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.398
We moved a lot.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.522
Right now we're looking at
the blood flow to Foss' brain.

24:19.255 --> 24:22.193
Each time he answers a question,
a memory's triggered,

24:22.389 --> 24:23.902
certain areas of brain will light up.

24:24.022 --> 24:25.957
Signaling an increase
in blood flow to that area.

24:26.913 --> 24:29.033
- So it acts as a map.
- Exactly.

24:29.633 --> 24:31.894
We can discover where each
of his memories are stored.

24:32.123 --> 24:33.985
Where'd you do your special ops traing?

24:34.969 --> 24:36.957
I spent some time at Quantico.

24:37.341 --> 24:40.586
I'm past that. It's... It's classified.

24:42.642 --> 24:43.809
Quantico, huh?

24:44.755 --> 24:46.091
Must have just missed each other.

24:46.211 --> 24:47.968
Yeah, probably.

24:49.082 --> 24:50.177
You married?

24:56.902 --> 24:57.984
Nope.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.131
You ever been married?

25:09.799 --> 25:10.824
What's her name?

25:11.040 --> 25:12.479
Her name was Erica.

25:13.290 --> 25:15.704
Foss was drunk and driving.

25:16.107 --> 25:17.748
Crash killed his wife and daughter.

25:18.099 --> 25:21.049
Those are his most powerful,
most visceral memories.

25:21.705 --> 25:23.745
The kind he buried deep behind

25:23.880 --> 25:25.839
an emotional firewall, so to speak.

25:26.634 --> 25:28.527
But once we begin the process...

25:29.658 --> 25:31.512
The machine can draw those memories out.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.580
If it can work on him,

25:34.047 --> 25:35.849
we can break through Kyle's firewall.

25:36.444 --> 25:37.935
A Plan B, if you will.

25:39.678 --> 25:42.398
And you can remove the information
that you require.

25:46.688 --> 25:47.853
Here's your mission:

25:47.976 --> 25:49.661
look through all your footage

25:49.784 --> 25:51.849
and dig up whatever dirt
you can on Jessi Hollander.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.104
Why her?

25:53.411 --> 25:55.369
I need some juicy scoop
on the contestants.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.372
Then take a look at the one
who bribed his way into the contest.

26:05.976 --> 26:06.755
<i>All right,</i>

26:07.255 --> 26:08.255
<i>75?</i>

26:08.794 --> 26:09.886
<i>65.</i>

26:10.750 --> 26:13.303
Little Joshie Trager,
what are you up to?

26:13.750 --> 26:15.848
<i>- 65, come on.
- Can you clarify that?</i>

26:16.997 --> 26:19.356
Little Joshie Trager's girlfriend.

26:20.959 --> 26:22.980
I'm just doing a little
background piece on all the

26:23.100 --> 26:24.619
contestants. Nothing heavy,

26:24.739 --> 26:26.939
just some feel-good fluff.
Care to comment?

26:27.059 --> 26:30.571
Great. I love me some feel-good,
fluffy cancer talk.

26:32.010 --> 26:33.991
Love the sarcasm. Hate

26:34.111 --> 26:35.111
the hat.

26:35.404 --> 26:37.536
Do you seriously object
to cancer research?

26:37.991 --> 26:40.167
Not as much as I object to people

26:40.290 --> 26:42.257
who don't answer a question directly.

26:42.682 --> 26:44.397
So, again, I ask,

26:44.606 --> 26:46.044
what are you onto with Josh?

26:46.339 --> 26:48.756
Seriously, it's nothing.

26:52.713 --> 26:54.487
Why don't you show me
what you're looking at,

26:54.622 --> 26:56.139
then we'll decide if it's nothing.

26:56.262 --> 26:57.327
<i>65, come on.</i>

26:57.463 --> 26:59.024
<i>- Hey, fine, fine.
- Sweet.</i>

26:59.196 --> 27:00.536
<i>Here you go, dude.</i>

27:04.316 --> 27:06.811
<i>- Oh! Another one bites the dust!
- The sweet smell of victory.</i>

27:06.934 --> 27:09.061
Starting to see some wear
and tear on the contestants.

27:09.197 --> 27:10.059
<i>Hang in there.</i>

27:10.306 --> 27:12.237
You paid 65 bucks
for a spot in the contest?

27:12.357 --> 27:13.989
How brain damaged are you?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.699
Cheating at a charity event?

27:16.340 --> 27:19.912
- You don't care about this fundraiser.
- Doesn't mean you can buy your way in.

27:20.434 --> 27:21.789
This isn't a joke.

27:22.323 --> 27:23.372
Wait a minute.

27:23.530 --> 27:25.841
Two seconds ago,
you wouldn't set foot in this tent.

27:25.976 --> 27:27.628
- Now you're all schizo?
- Schizo?

27:28.269 --> 27:29.338
First I can't talk about...

27:30.347 --> 27:31.368
you know...

27:31.528 --> 27:34.084
stuff...
that you told me not to talk about.

27:34.526 --> 27:35.969
you don't even want to deal with...

27:37.246 --> 27:39.097
stuff. And now you're all in my face.

27:39.975 --> 27:42.768
Hey, I can be schizo if I want to be.
I'm the one with cancer!

27:56.560 --> 27:57.654
Andy, wait.

28:01.515 --> 28:03.503
<i>The grownups are starting to clear out.</i>

28:03.623 --> 28:04.943
<i>Too old to hang, huh?</i>

28:05.091 --> 28:08.767
<i>That's all right, because I'm gonna
keep this party rockin' all night long.</i>

28:09.357 --> 28:10.764
I made fun of Andy's hat.

28:10.918 --> 28:12.689
Then it turns out she has cancer.

28:12.922 --> 28:15.175
Footage good, feelings bad.

28:15.295 --> 28:16.477
Nobody knew.

28:17.681 --> 28:19.194
I plan on apologizing

28:19.317 --> 28:21.222
as soon as I finish
the rest of this story.

28:21.510 --> 28:23.058
What exactly is your story about?

28:25.094 --> 28:26.478
Okay, disclaimer:

28:26.902 --> 28:28.480
this has nothing to do with you

28:28.600 --> 28:30.065
or the fact you guys were dating.

28:31.087 --> 28:32.427
Before you yell,

28:32.575 --> 28:35.028
I swear I am in no way
meddling or intruding

28:35.148 --> 28:36.428
or prying.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.366
I asked her to drudge up
some dirt on Jessi.

28:39.955 --> 28:40.826
Really?

28:41.273 --> 28:42.953
- For anything good?
- You're not yelling.

28:44.801 --> 28:47.165
- Why would I yell?
- I'm on a deadline, people.

28:47.515 --> 28:49.334
And I actually did kinda find something.

28:49.641 --> 28:52.621
Remember my dorky little
camera peon from video yearbook?

28:52.756 --> 28:55.549
Turns out he's noticed Jessi
at some school events.

28:56.137 --> 28:57.926
He said she hangs out
on the sidelines a lot.

28:58.338 --> 29:01.722
I think his exact words were
"She's really lurky. "

29:02.285 --> 29:04.349
Anyways, there might be
some stuff on these DVDs.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.728
You wanna us look through the footage?
Would you mind?

29:08.578 --> 29:10.439
- Consider it done.
- Thanks.

29:13.653 --> 29:15.736
<i>- Things are a go at this end.
- Thank you, Steven.</i>

29:19.603 --> 29:20.734
We're ready.

29:41.198 --> 29:42.563
Tom, are you still with me?

29:48.794 --> 29:49.860
<i>Nine hours!</i>

29:50.007 --> 29:52.290
<i>And those two show no sign of stopping.</i>

29:52.480 --> 29:53.978
<i>I'm almost impressed.</i>

29:54.108 --> 29:56.450
Let's see if they can break
last year's record.

30:00.567 --> 30:01.990
You really think win this thing?

30:02.781 --> 30:04.242
Are you ask me to win it for you?

30:05.351 --> 30:06.396
No.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.806
I'm asking you to win it for Andy.

30:08.995 --> 30:10.859
Josh, I'm really sorry about her.

30:13.802 --> 30:15.705
This thing
has been bumming her out, and...

30:15.825 --> 30:17.946
I thought if I could
win the car for her...

30:19.925 --> 30:21.203
You gotta do this for me.

30:22.409 --> 30:23.246
Please.

30:24.795 --> 30:26.168
This is what you do.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.579
You help people.

30:29.892 --> 30:31.134
I'll do my best.

30:50.412 --> 30:52.275
Do you really think
that you can help me?

31:00.458 --> 31:01.692
I'd like to try.

31:04.518 --> 31:05.827
This isn't normal.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.536
I shouldn't be seeing those things.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.794
I shouldn't be seeing them with you.

31:11.385 --> 31:13.736
I don't understand
why this is happening,

31:14.334 --> 31:15.965
but we can figure it out together.

31:16.896 --> 31:17.913
How?

31:18.084 --> 31:19.594
You have to open your mind to me.

31:22.375 --> 31:23.391
Trust me.

31:37.911 --> 31:39.153
It's too loud.

31:39.578 --> 31:41.195
Just block out the noise.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.763
Close your eyes and focus.

31:46.666 --> 31:48.164
Keep listening to my voice...

31:49.499 --> 31:51.192
turning out all other sound

31:51.393 --> 31:53.669
until it's just like
static on the radio...

31:55.023 --> 31:57.099
then quieter like a fly buzzing...

31:59.243 --> 32:01.052
until the sound just disappears.

32:22.129 --> 32:23.525
Hindsight is an awful thing.

32:23.694 --> 32:25.220
I should have never worn those shoes.

32:26.021 --> 32:27.488
There she is again.

32:27.763 --> 32:29.569
Yeah, not doing anything.

32:32.188 --> 32:34.043
My nose looks puffy.

32:35.365 --> 32:36.662
I don't see her.

32:38.441 --> 32:40.811
Over your shoulder, against the wall.

32:41.518 --> 32:43.116
Your nose isn't puffy.

32:45.575 --> 32:47.556
And this is from the end of the night.

32:49.900 --> 32:50.971
Oh, my God.

32:53.675 --> 32:55.048
Oh, my God, what?

32:56.181 --> 32:57.599
She has my necklace.

32:59.684 --> 33:01.584
She's the one who attacked me.

33:12.780 --> 33:14.223
Ballantine, what's happening?

33:24.894 --> 33:26.716
<i>The machine's taxing our energy.</i>

33:26.847 --> 33:28.750
Then find the flaw
and eliminate the problem.

33:28.870 --> 33:30.682
<i>We oughta power down,
make sure the subject</i>

33:30.802 --> 33:31.535
is all right.

33:31.687 --> 33:32.851
It's under control.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.056
Concentrate on a solution.

33:41.629 --> 33:43.904
I'm not drunk!

33:44.309 --> 33:45.325
<i>Don't yell.</i>

33:45.739 --> 33:48.074
<i>- You'll wake Sara.
- Sorry I missed the recital.</i>

33:48.194 --> 33:49.923
I just... I lost track
of time, that's all.

33:50.436 --> 33:52.637
I don't like what I'm seeing here!
He could stroke out!

33:52.919 --> 33:54.915
<i>Ballantine, can you hear me in there?</i>

33:55.284 --> 33:57.000
<i>- That's enough.
- Kyle's mind is</i>

33:57.120 --> 33:59.109
<i>far more advanced,
and his resistance is stronger.</i>

33:59.232 --> 34:01.004
<i>We have to see how far
this machine can go.</i>

34:02.432 --> 34:03.843
Proceed as directed.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.612
<i>Are you looking at my boobs again?</i>

34:09.772 --> 34:12.431
<i>I'm paying you in pizza for
a reality show audition tape.</i>

34:12.674 --> 34:15.561
Did you hear me use the word soft-core
anywhere in our agreement?

34:15.786 --> 34:18.125
- No.
- Josh, listen. I'm sorry.

34:18.268 --> 34:20.773
I had no idea that I'd get you
kicked out of the contest.

34:21.034 --> 34:22.609
<i>No thanks to your little ambush.</i>

34:23.137 --> 34:24.110
Get a life.

34:25.556 --> 34:27.280
You know what? My career as a tabloid

34:27.400 --> 34:28.565
journalist is officially over.

34:28.846 --> 34:29.782
We just cut.

34:36.181 --> 34:37.665
You can slow it down.

34:45.536 --> 34:47.248
- It's working.
- Yeah.

34:54.855 --> 34:56.167
I saw this...

34:56.958 --> 34:58.186
in that place underground.

34:59.457 --> 35:00.542
Wait.

35:00.932 --> 35:01.939
What is this?

35:06.923 --> 35:07.904
My sister.

35:10.713 --> 35:12.241
Hello! Personal crisis here.

35:12.887 --> 35:14.762
Lori, are you okay?
Did you find something?

35:14.908 --> 35:16.664
The minute she takes
her hand off that car,

35:16.784 --> 35:18.624
I rip it off her arm and bitch-slap her.

35:18.744 --> 35:20.165
You can't hit her. Call the police.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.285
Trager, hold on!

35:21.846 --> 35:22.877
I want to see more.

35:24.376 --> 35:25.379
Here we go.

35:31.909 --> 35:33.679
I can't see anything. It's dark.

35:34.017 --> 35:34.889
Do you hear that?

35:37.281 --> 35:38.627
I'm in a dark room.

35:42.989 --> 35:44.083
I don't know where I am.

35:44.284 --> 35:45.316
Don't be afraid.

35:57.319 --> 35:58.469
<i>Emily's there.</i>

35:59.323 --> 36:00.831
But I don't remember this happening.

36:05.281 --> 36:06.561
<i>What's going on?</i>

36:23.000 --> 36:24.557
God, you're just a kid.

36:25.959 --> 36:27.232
That's it. Don't be afraid.

36:28.989 --> 36:29.989
She shot me.

36:47.410 --> 36:48.424
Are you okay?

36:50.925 --> 36:52.670
I don't know what I am anymore.

36:55.791 --> 36:58.029
I finally accomplished what I wanted.

36:58.672 --> 37:00.777
I knew the truth about who she was.

37:01.468 --> 37:03.509
<i>But how could I explain it to her?</i>

37:28.049 --> 37:29.145
What did I miss?

37:29.843 --> 37:33.495
Well, the circuits got overloaded
from all the sound equipment and lights.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.402
There was some sort of explosion.

37:35.522 --> 37:36.605
My God.

37:36.740 --> 37:38.400
But Kyle and Jessi are okay.

37:40.343 --> 37:43.393
Would it be totally wrong
for me to ask you who won?

37:44.846 --> 37:46.766
Technically, Kyle and Jessi both won.

37:46.902 --> 37:49.299
But since they can't split
the car without a chainsaw,

37:49.766 --> 37:51.840
the judges decided
to give it to the charity.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.008
That's an entire day wasted.

37:54.408 --> 37:57.057
I, on the other hand,
have been very productive.

37:57.303 --> 37:58.496
Check this out.

37:58.656 --> 37:59.968
How sweet is this?

38:01.984 --> 38:04.305
My very own lame slogan.

38:05.243 --> 38:06.808
So you're ready to go public?

38:08.402 --> 38:09.746
I guess I kinda did already.

38:11.172 --> 38:12.963
Besides, if I don't have this on,

38:13.123 --> 38:14.649
yours would look really stupid.

38:16.703 --> 38:17.902
"I'm with Cancer Girl. "

38:18.633 --> 38:20.650
But you'll always have
to stand on my left,

38:20.773 --> 38:21.990
or it won't make sense.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.854
That's awesome.

38:26.657 --> 38:27.954
You're awesome.

38:31.077 --> 38:32.459
You're kind of awesome, too.

38:39.196 --> 38:40.974
That's not how you do it.

38:58.331 --> 39:00.195
Nicole, what happened?

39:00.593 --> 39:01.593
Are they okay?

39:01.774 --> 39:03.823
Yeah, they're both doing fine.
They're resting.

39:03.943 --> 39:05.700
You stay the hell away from my family!

39:05.820 --> 39:07.035
- Lori!
- What?

39:07.155 --> 39:09.370
Her nutcase sister
is the one who attacked me.

39:09.490 --> 39:10.371
No,

39:10.491 --> 39:11.545
Jessi wouldn't do that.

39:11.668 --> 39:13.500
There must be a logical
explanation for this.

39:14.534 --> 39:16.669
You're gonna listen to her
and not your own daughter?

39:19.907 --> 39:21.358
I don't even want to talk to you.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.176
- Honey, wait.
- Mom, please.

39:34.957 --> 39:36.159
How did you do it?

39:38.100 --> 39:40.244
How did you know how to make me rember?

39:50.251 --> 39:51.610
They were your memories.

39:53.366 --> 39:54.624
They were there all along.

39:56.386 --> 39:57.911
But I don't understand.

39:58.415 --> 39:59.912
How could they be my memories?

40:00.033 --> 40:02.382
How was I ever that girl
we saw in the dark?

40:06.800 --> 40:08.792
There's something
I think you should know.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.809
I have a feeling we're
more alike than you think.

40:14.908 --> 40:16.521
What do you mean?

40:57.181 --> 40:58.500
They said you could...

41:11.496 --> 41:12.676
Amanda, wait!

41:12.947 --> 41:14.912
I trusted you when you broke our date

41:15.795 --> 41:18.410
I trusted you with Jessi,
even when I didn't think I should.

41:19.581 --> 41:20.941
I thought you were different.

41:21.089 --> 41:22.128
It's not what you think.

41:22.459 --> 41:23.459
No?

41:24.094 --> 41:25.173
What was it, then?

41:26.392 --> 41:27.425
We were just talking.

41:28.815 --> 41:30.511
If you had any idea how much of a guy

41:30.631 --> 41:31.896
you sound like right now.

41:32.074 --> 41:34.127
Amanda, you know me better than that.

41:34.786 --> 41:36.351
Please, just believe in me.

41:38.025 --> 41:39.687
That's what Charlie always said.

41:52.619 --> 41:54.316
Jessi, thank God.

41:54.463 --> 41:56.726
I have been looking for you all night.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.062
Hi, Mommy!

42:02.721 --> 42:03.920
Hi, sweetheart.

42:11.047 --> 42:12.412
What do you want?

42:17.170 --> 42:18.601
I wanna know who I really am.

42:24.916 --> 42:27.658
<i>That morning, Nicole had asked me
how well I knew Jessi.</i>

42:28.555 --> 42:30.731
<i>Now I understood
she was someone like me.</i>

42:32.058 --> 42:35.071
<i>The discovery left me even more
troubled and confused...</i>

42:37.013 --> 42:39.140
<i>and wondering what
it might have cost me.</i>

42:43.137 --> 42:44.563
I just spoke to the police.

42:44.710 --> 42:47.694
They went to Emily's house
to look for Jessi, and she's gone.

42:47.837 --> 42:48.715
She's run away.
