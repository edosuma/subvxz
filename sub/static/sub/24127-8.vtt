WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:21.000 --> 01:23.208
Uh, Pooh and Tigger,
would you like to hear

01:23.208 --> 01:24.500
the new poem I've written?

01:24.500 --> 01:27.125
Well, I'd really
like to, Pigalet,

01:27.125 --> 01:29.125
but I got to go put
my socks in order--

01:29.125 --> 01:30.875
alphabetical order.

01:30.875 --> 01:34.125
But, Tigger, you don't
have any socks.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.333
I know,
but I-- I-- I--

01:37.583 --> 01:41.083
We'd love to hear
your poem, Piglet.

01:43.125 --> 01:44.708
Ahem.

01:44.708 --> 01:46.166
"Ode to Flowers."

01:46.166 --> 01:49.250
A poem by Piglet.
That's me.

01:49.250 --> 01:53.125
"Oh, how I love to sit and gaze
upon the pretty flowers."

01:53.125 --> 01:55.125
Yes, that's the way
each summer day

01:55.125 --> 01:56.708
I like to pass the hours.

01:56.708 --> 01:59.458
And every, every single time

01:59.458 --> 02:00.875
I see a daffodil--

02:00.875 --> 02:02.458
Tigger: Yuck.

02:02.458 --> 02:05.625
I think this rhyming stuff
is making me feel ill.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.458
Say, Pigalet, you know,

02:07.458 --> 02:10.208
this isn't a very poetical
piece of poohetry.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.416
"The rose is
such a pretty thing.

02:14.416 --> 02:16.875
It always makes me
want to sing."

02:16.875 --> 02:18.166
Yuck!

02:18.166 --> 02:21.833
Let me see if I can
fix this up for you.

02:29.375 --> 02:32.166
Tigger: I love to smell
the pretty flowers

02:32.166 --> 02:34.166
when I take a morning stroll.

02:35.708 --> 02:38.000
But I'm so busy sniffing,

02:38.000 --> 02:39.833
I fall into a hole.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.750
Yaah!

02:51.083 --> 02:53.333
Now this is poetry.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.958
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

02:56.458 --> 02:58.708
Now here's
a splendid specimen

02:58.708 --> 03:00.875
as lovely as you please.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.833
It would be a whole lot nicer

03:02.833 --> 03:04.958
if it weren't full of bees.

03:07.583 --> 03:10.000
Oh, no!

03:10.000 --> 03:12.458
So off you go
with all your might,

03:12.458 --> 03:14.625
running around
at the speed of light.

03:14.625 --> 03:17.458
You ought to stop
and take a riff,

03:17.458 --> 03:19.875
but you just stepped
right off a cliff.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.500
Yaah!

03:32.875 --> 03:34.291
Oh, d-d-dear.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.208
This isn't at all
the poem I had in mind.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.750
And so you think
your trouble's over

03:39.750 --> 03:42.083
and you're really
pretty pleased.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.125
But you don't want
to slow down now

03:44.125 --> 03:46.875
'cause you forgot
them bumbly bees.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.708
Did I mention a brick wall?

03:54.708 --> 03:56.125
No.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.708
Sorry.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.708
If only you were just a bit,

04:03.708 --> 04:06.083
a tiny bit...bigger.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.083
But since you aren't,
you'll have to yell.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.000
Oh, save me, save me, Tigger!

04:15.000 --> 04:17.750
So say goodbye
to all the flowers

04:17.750 --> 04:19.750
'cause this here
poem is done.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.208
But just remember
to thank old Tigger

04:22.208 --> 04:24.875
for giving you all this fun.

04:24.875 --> 04:28.000
Oh, that was a wonderful
poem, Piglet.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.625
Very exciting.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.416
Do you perhaps have
another one we could read?

04:32.416 --> 04:34.958
Help!

04:36.625 --> 04:38.625
Rabbit:
It was awfully nice of you

04:38.625 --> 04:41.291
to invite us over
to hear your poem, Piglet.

04:41.291 --> 04:44.166
Eeyore: Yep, had
nothing better to do.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.125
- Not that I ever do.
-

04:48.583 --> 04:51.458
I can't quite put
my finger on it,

04:51.458 --> 04:54.416
but there's something different
about your house, Piglet.

04:54.416 --> 04:56.833
It must be the flowers.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.500
I took a few precautions

05:03.500 --> 05:05.583
to keep Tigger from
ruining my new poem.

05:05.583 --> 05:08.958
Feel something bad
about to happen.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.208
- There.
-

05:12.208 --> 05:13.458
Now I'm safe to read it.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.833
I call my poem
"To Be Small."

05:19.833 --> 05:22.000
"I never saw a poem, you see,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.500
"as lovely
as a piglet like me.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.625
"There's nothing
wrong to being minute,

05:26.625 --> 05:29.750
and let's face it,
I am very cute."

05:33.166 --> 05:34.875
Oh, dear.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.708
Perhaps I should have
checked the roof

05:36.708 --> 05:38.083
before I started my--

05:38.083 --> 05:40.000
- ...poem.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.958
Never fear. Tigger's here!

05:42.958 --> 05:44.416
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

05:44.416 --> 05:48.375
Hmm. A birdie.
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

05:48.375 --> 05:49.875
Let me out, Tigger.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.875
And it talks, too.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.416
The birdie is actually Piglet.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.500
You sure, if I toss him up
into the wild blue yonder,

05:58.500 --> 06:00.333
he won't flap around for us?

06:00.333 --> 06:03.000
Tigger, sit down
and be quiet.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.208
Piglet's about to read us
another of his poems.

06:06.208 --> 06:09.083
Yep. Can't wait.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.208
Tigger, you can stay
if you promise to behave.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.333
"To be small
or not to be small.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.833
"That's no small matter
at all.

06:19.833 --> 06:22.583
"Many nice things
can be quite teeny.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.375
A leaf, a bird,
even a beanie."

06:26.083 --> 06:29.000
You can hide in a crack
or a thimble.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.208
Tigger: But suddenly you get
ker-smashed by a cymbal.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.500
Oh, so many tiggers here.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.875
Now that's what I call
poohetry. Hoo hoo hoo!

06:44.708 --> 06:47.583
It's hard to be little
like a fly.

06:47.583 --> 06:50.583
Take one wrong step,
and it's bye-bye.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.958
Nothing, you see,
is ever that small,

06:56.958 --> 07:00.000
unless it stands
next to something tall.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.583
Whoops. How's that happen?

07:01.583 --> 07:04.458
I just say the word
and visionalize,

07:04.458 --> 07:06.875
and I'll be back
to my tiggerish size.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.333
This poohetry--

07:09.333 --> 07:10.750
I think it's time to quit.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.458
It does seem to have
a few bugs in it.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.500
- Help me, Pigalet!

07:15.500 --> 07:17.000
I'm losing my lead!

07:17.000 --> 07:19.875
I don't want to end up
as buggety-bug feed.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.250
Piglet: The teeny-weeny
Tigger runs up a tree.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.750
And splashes
into the raging sea.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.166
Yaah!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.250
He tries to grab onto a log.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.958
But it turns out
to be a giant frog.

07:53.375 --> 07:56.833
My, I like this much better
than my last poem,

07:56.833 --> 07:59.583
though I'm not
sure Tigger does.

07:59.583 --> 08:02.166
Splishety-splash,
he goes down the creek.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.458
I thought we was
in the ocean.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.833
Uh-oh.

08:16.375 --> 08:19.708
Suddenly he's grabbed
by a big bird beak.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.166
Hey, be careful what you say.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.875
One wrong word
could ruin my day.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.458
High into the sky
Tigger does soar,

08:28.458 --> 08:30.166
but then he quickly drops--

08:32.458 --> 08:34.291
...onto an Eeyore.

08:34.291 --> 08:35.250
Oof.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.750
Hmm.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.458
Looks like some kind
of tigger fly.

08:40.458 --> 08:43.166
So Eeyore swats him
7 miles high.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.708
Whoa!

08:47.208 --> 08:48.416
Until he slams...

08:50.375 --> 08:52.000
into Rabbit.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.375
Hmm. That doesn't
rhyme very well.

08:55.375 --> 08:58.000
Hey, who turned out
the lights?

09:06.166 --> 09:07.875
Ah, ah, ah...

09:07.875 --> 09:09.208
choo!

09:11.708 --> 09:14.958
Hmm. This feels
kind of déjà blue.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.333
Hello, Tigger.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.875
Hi, Pooh boy.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
Tigger? Tigger?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.000
Where did he go?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.500
Could you do me a favor?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.958
Don't let me become
today's favorite flavor.

09:34.958 --> 09:37.750
Whatever you do,
don't take a swallow.

09:42.958 --> 09:46.250
Oh, oh, whoa!

09:50.500 --> 09:53.875
Tigger? Tigger?
Where did he go?

09:53.875 --> 09:55.875
.

09:55.875 --> 09:56.958
Oh, no.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.208
Piglet: I turn the knob.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.458
Look what pours out:

09:59.458 --> 10:01.458
A little tigger
from the spout.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.416
I didn't know all the while

10:06.416 --> 10:09.250
that being little
was such a trial.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.458
Well, you've been
through enough for today.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.750
It's time for you
to grow, I'd say.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.750
He's
begun to shrink.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.000
He's smaller
than a blob of ink.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.625
I'm starting to feel
a little queer.

10:23.625 --> 10:26.291
If this keeps up,
I'll disappear.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.166
Oh, dear.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.083
When I told Tigger
I wanted him to grow,

10:31.083 --> 10:34.333
I meant grow big,
not small. Oh, no.

10:48.583 --> 10:51.958
Whew. I learned my lesson.
That's for sure.

10:51.958 --> 10:54.708
I'll never make fun
of poohetry no more.

10:54.708 --> 10:58.750
I promise everyone
I'll always be good.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.958
Say, is that a flying redwood?

11:03.375 --> 11:04.750
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
Don't worry, Tigger.
That's okay

11:08.500 --> 11:11.708
But you can go far,
far away.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.625
All this nothing
is so widespread.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.875
Wonder if it was
something that I said.

11:21.708 --> 11:23.125
Nah!

11:48.708 --> 11:51.583
So soft, so soothing.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.875
So call me a sentimental fool,

11:53.875 --> 11:55.500
but I do love to hear

11:55.500 --> 11:58.458
the birds sing
the dawn chorus.

11:58.458 --> 12:01.375
Not that I generally allow
the feathered felons

12:01.375 --> 12:03.458
within a hundred miles
of my garden,

12:03.458 --> 12:05.708
but the birds
of the dawn chorus

12:05.708 --> 12:08.083
shall always be an exception.

12:10.708 --> 12:12.500
Aha!

12:15.750 --> 12:18.875
What could possibly
be more beautiful?

12:18.875 --> 12:21.583
- Oh, my. Oh, my.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.500
Oh, my, oh, my!

12:23.500 --> 12:26.583
Piglet: Pooh, would you care
for some tea with honey?

12:26.583 --> 12:30.583
Yes, Piglet, but without
the tea, if you please.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.250
- Ee!

12:41.291 --> 12:42.708
And there it was,

12:42.708 --> 12:44.875
whatever it was, again.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.708
Kind of sounded
like a heffalump

12:46.708 --> 12:48.208
pushing a woozle
down a hill

12:48.208 --> 12:50.875
with a spookable
tied around his nose.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.125
Come on, you guys.
We got to find out

12:57.125 --> 12:59.750
what's disturbing
the peace and the quiet.

13:03.458 --> 13:06.958
Owl, cease that silly
screeching this second!

13:17.500 --> 13:19.625
Will you please be quiet?

13:19.625 --> 13:22.958
Be quiet? As in not sing?

13:27.250 --> 13:29.500
Stop, you vegetable vandals!

13:29.500 --> 13:31.583
Come back with my produce!

13:31.583 --> 13:34.833
Owl, just look
what you've done!

13:34.833 --> 13:37.333
I'm sure it was
that off-key, out-of-tune

13:37.333 --> 13:39.166
so-called voice of yours

13:39.166 --> 13:42.166
which brought those confounded
crows here in the first place.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.000
Am I to understand

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
that you did not like
my performance?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.291
I want you out of my
garden this moment,

13:50.291 --> 13:52.166
right away,
effective immediately,

13:52.166 --> 13:53.708
if not sooner!

13:53.708 --> 13:56.583
I can take a hint.

13:57.875 --> 14:01.416
Poor Owl. He seems rather sad.

14:01.416 --> 14:03.583
Not half as sad as I am.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.875
Just look what his sorry
singing has cost me.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.708
Oh, don't worry, bunny boy.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.250
I'll help you turn this garden

14:10.250 --> 14:12.708
into the crow-proofiest
garden ever.

14:12.708 --> 14:16.833
And perhaps, Piglet,
we can help Owl.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.208
Maybe, Owl,

14:18.208 --> 14:20.875
if you sang just
a little more...little?

14:20.875 --> 14:23.583
I believe you should
sing like this.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.250
That is all good and well
for one note,

14:30.250 --> 14:33.208
but there are many more
needing attention.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.625
For example--

14:42.000 --> 14:44.583
- And how was that, Piglet?

14:44.583 --> 14:45.708
Piglet?

14:45.708 --> 14:46.833
Well, Owl,

14:46.833 --> 14:50.375
it was perhaps
a little loud?

14:50.375 --> 14:53.583
Tigger, are you sure
you're sure about this?

14:53.583 --> 14:56.166
Sure. Building
crow catching traps

14:56.166 --> 14:58.000
is what tiggers do the best.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.708
Just be careful you don't touch
that thingamabobbie there.

15:01.708 --> 15:05.000
And don't step on that
doohickey over there.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.583
And whatever you do,

15:06.583 --> 15:08.000
don't get near
the whatever-it-is

15:08.000 --> 15:09.500
next to the I forgot
what to call it.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.875
Well, as long as your
crow trap traps those--

15:12.875 --> 15:14.291
- ...crows?

15:17.208 --> 15:20.458
Get out of my garden,
you ravenous ravens!

15:23.708 --> 15:27.083
Hey, long ears, look out
for the whatchamadoodle!

15:27.083 --> 15:29.333
You mean this
whatchamadoodle?

15:34.583 --> 15:37.166
Tigger, your trap
isn't trapping the crows.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.583
It's helping them!

15:38.583 --> 15:40.291
Hoo! Don't worry, bunny boy.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.333
It's not done doing yet.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.291
Yahoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

15:45.583 --> 15:46.833
Now it's done.

15:47.833 --> 15:49.125
I believe,

15:49.125 --> 15:51.125
by having
a smackerel of this,

15:51.125 --> 15:53.000
you can make
your singing sound

15:53.000 --> 15:54.583
as sweet as honey.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.416
Honey, you see,

15:56.416 --> 15:58.958
ought to make your
singing much smoother

15:58.958 --> 16:00.416
and more tasteful.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.250
I say, Pooh Bear,

16:10.250 --> 16:12.583
I do believe
I now have a voice

16:12.583 --> 16:14.375
to bring down the house.

16:14.375 --> 16:17.875
The dawn chorus awaits.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.291
Oh, dear.
I don't really think

16:24.291 --> 16:27.000
Owl's singing has gotten
too very much better.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.458
Do you, Pooh?

16:28.458 --> 16:30.500
Yes, Piglet, I don't.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.958
I think this may
require some thinking.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.208
Tigger: These crows are smart.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.000
What we're gonna need

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
is a super-stupendious
trap.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.375
Now for the secret
ingrediament.

16:49.583 --> 16:52.875
And what exactly is
the secret ingredament--

16:52.875 --> 16:54.583
ingredient?

16:54.583 --> 16:57.000
Keep it under your hat,
long ears,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
because the secret is...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.708
swill.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.458
And what is swill?

17:03.458 --> 17:05.000
It's what you get

17:05.000 --> 17:06.833
when you add
a little of this

17:06.833 --> 17:08.625
and probably
a lot more of that.

17:10.208 --> 17:13.500
This is absopolilutely
guaranteed to work.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.458
Hmm. Well, just to be
safe, Tigger,

17:16.458 --> 17:19.083
I want you to watch
my garden tonight.

17:19.083 --> 17:23.166
Hoo hoo! Guardin' gardens
is what tiggers do the best.

17:25.083 --> 17:28.166
I think I've been
think-thinking all night--

17:28.166 --> 17:31.000
-- and I haven't
thought a single thought.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.125
Oof!

17:32.125 --> 17:34.083
Oh, bother.

17:34.083 --> 17:37.250
Perhaps if I sat
in my favorite honey tree,

17:37.250 --> 17:38.958
a thought would come to me.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.875
I do wonder who could
teach a bird like Owl

17:58.875 --> 18:01.750
to sing like a bird.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.250
Oof!

18:05.250 --> 18:07.500
Who's there?
State your name, rank,

18:07.500 --> 18:09.083
and favorite brand
of cereal.

18:14.833 --> 18:17.583
I must have been
thinking in my sleep

18:17.583 --> 18:20.083
because I thought
I heard singing.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.125
All: Uh-oh!

18:24.000 --> 18:27.291
Was it you birds who were
singing like birds?

18:28.625 --> 18:31.416
Do you suppose you could
teach Owl to sing

18:31.416 --> 18:33.833
as you've just sung
the song you sang?

18:33.833 --> 18:35.958
All: Aw!

18:35.958 --> 18:40.166
He wants to join the chorus
in Rabbit's garden.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.333
Uh, Owl, perhaps
you should rehearse

18:45.333 --> 18:48.333
just the least bit more
before you join the chorus.

18:48.333 --> 18:52.125
Owl, I've found these teachers
to help you with your singing.

18:52.125 --> 18:55.166
Dear Pooh, my singing
is beyond help--

18:55.166 --> 18:59.250
uh, by which I mean
to say I simply could be
no better than I am.

18:59.250 --> 19:04.125
However, I would be glad
to have your friends
join me in the chorus.

19:04.125 --> 19:07.375
Uh, the more the merrier,
I always say. Hoo hoo.

19:07.375 --> 19:11.125
So long as you don't
step on my solo.

19:11.125 --> 19:14.125
Stop in the name of
the long arm of the law!

19:14.125 --> 19:15.458
Who's going there?

19:15.458 --> 19:17.625
It is I: Owl,

19:17.625 --> 19:20.291
star of the dawn
chorus,

19:20.291 --> 19:22.125
and associates.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.875
Well, then come on in.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.583
The more the merrier,
I always say. Hoo hoo!

19:26.583 --> 19:29.375
Just don't go
near the swill.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.458
And now to take
my place in the chorus.

19:34.458 --> 19:37.000
Uh, Piglet, if you please.

19:49.625 --> 19:52.000
Ah, the dawn chorus.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.333
So soft, so soothing, so--

19:57.833 --> 20:00.625
Not that infernal
racket again.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.833
What was that? Crows?

20:05.833 --> 20:07.333
Do I hear crows?

20:13.958 --> 20:17.875
Owl! Stop that ridiculous
racket right now!

20:17.875 --> 20:23.416
But, Rabbit, Owl's singing
did scare the crows away.

20:23.416 --> 20:26.125
And it doesn't look as if
they'll be coming back.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.250
Oh, my. You're right.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.708
In fact,
it seems Owl's singing

20:30.708 --> 20:33.250
is the only thing that
will keep the crows away.

20:33.250 --> 20:36.500
Hmm. Wonder what went
wrong with my trap.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.250
Must have been
a defective doohickey.

20:38.250 --> 20:42.750
If you'll excuse me,
I must be off.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.000
Now, Owl,
let's not be hasty.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.125
You know you're welcome
to sing in my garden

20:47.125 --> 20:49.458
right here as often
as you'd like.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.291
I do appreciate
the offer, Rabbit,

20:52.291 --> 20:56.125
but it has occurred to me
that my voice talents

20:56.125 --> 20:59.083
are far too fine
for the dawn chorus.

21:01.958 --> 21:05.500
I am now ready
for the evening chorus.

21:20.708 --> 21:23.291
Maybe I didn't
use enough swill?

21:23.291 --> 21:25.583
Nah! Couldn't be that.
Hoo hoo!

21:25.583 --> 21:27.958
It's got to be
this thingamabobbie.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.583
- Rabbit: Ooh!

21:29.583 --> 21:32.583
Tigger, what is this?

21:32.583 --> 21:36.416
This, bunny boy,
is swill.

21:45.458 --> 21:49.833
It makes me very happy
to see Owl so very happy.

21:49.833 --> 21:51.166
Ha ha. Yes,

21:51.166 --> 21:53.458
things have turned out
quite nicely indeed.

21:53.458 --> 21:55.125
All right, everyone,

21:55.125 --> 21:58.000
the evening chorus
is about to begin.
