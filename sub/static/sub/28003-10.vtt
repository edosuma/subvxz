Don't you look dapper?

00:22.689 --> 00:26.192
Well, I thought it was right to buy
something special for the occasion.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.613
As you requested.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.783

Did you know?

Your father discovered...

06:54.664 --> 06:57.834
that you were capable of great things.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.546
Much like your brothers and sister.

But your powers were...

10:23.289 --> 10:24.749

10:24.832 --> 10:28.419

-No, that doesn't mean anything.

-You're not listening to me.

When I found it, I assumed this place
came down along with everything else.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.558
But here we are. The Moon's still shining,
the Earth is in one piece,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.560
but not the Academy.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.355
-[Klaus] I'm confused.
-Then listen to me, you idiot!

was the cause, but he was the fuse.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.258
Given a one-day assignment
to eliminate Number Five,

11:16.676 --> 11:20.346
and instead, you kill a tow truck driver,
a cleaning lady, and a cop,

11:20.429 --> 11:21.806
burn down two buildings,

11:21.889 --> 11:25.059
and bring unwanted attention
on yourselves and the Commission.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.478
What's worse is Five is still alive,

11:27.895 --> 11:30.523
on the loose,
and trying to stop the apocalypse.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.983

11:33.067 --> 11:34.402

Now, maybe I'm not seeing
the whole picture,
but I think--
and this, it's just a suggestion--

11:39.448 --> 11:42.702
but I do think... [chuckles]
...an explanation of sorts is owing.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.247
Five is not working alone.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.289
He has backup.

11:47.623 --> 11:48.499
His family.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.376
You're saying that you both

11:50.710 --> 11:54.880
are no match for a litter
of emotionally stunted siblings?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.884

there were certain un--

12:03.305 --> 12:04.140
Hmm?

12:04.890 --> 12:07.560
Unexpected consequences from said family

12:07.643 --> 12:10.271
that required us
to deviate from the original plan.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.731
[chuckles] You know,

12:13.524 --> 12:15.651
we have an old saying at the Commission.

12:16.402 --> 12:20.156
[speaking Yiddish]

12:22.366 --> 12:24.368
Of course, neither of you speak Yiddish.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.245
Fine. I'll translate.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.373
It means "The eggs think
they're smarter than the chicken."

12:31.208 --> 12:33.586
Do what you're told. Hmm?

12:34.670 --> 12:36.213
Then we should have killed each other.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.424
Come again?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.011
Both of us was sent a message from you

12:42.094 --> 12:43.304
to eliminate the other.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.889
I never sent--

12:46.390 --> 12:47.308
Oh.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.269
[chuckles] Hm.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.812

12:52.730 --> 12:53.689
He's good.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.150
-Wait, I'm not following.
-Of course you're not.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.070
I never sent those messages. Five did.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.615
They're fake. To throw you off the scent.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.867
Then you're not mad at us.

13:05.117 --> 13:09.205
I'd like to believe that your commitment
to your partnership led to a strategic...

13:09.955 --> 13:12.082
choice not to kill each other.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.002
So, in the spirit of that partnership,

13:16.879 --> 13:18.297
I'm giving you a new assignment,

13:18.380 --> 13:21.467
one that's not open to interpretation
or discussion.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.471
Protect Vanya Hargreeves...

13:25.930 --> 13:26.889
at all costs.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.644
-Then what?
-Then you, Hazel,

13:31.769 --> 13:33.479
will be allowed to resign
from the Commission

13:33.562 --> 13:35.815
and live out the remainder
of your days with...

13:36.315 --> 13:38.108
doughnut lady here,

13:38.400 --> 13:40.236
in the time period of your choosing.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.822
Course, she'll remain under my protection

13:43.239 --> 13:44.990
until your assignment is complete.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.325
And what do I get?

13:47.243 --> 13:48.327
A new partner.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.330
Plus all prior offenses, fines,
and infractions

13:51.413 --> 13:53.374
will be expunged from your record.

13:53.457 --> 13:57.211
Failure to comply will result
in the termination of all parties.

That's right. Her concert is tonight.

Hello.

15:35.976 --> 15:40.856
I hate to intrude, but my manager says
if you're not gonna bowl, you gotta leave.

15:42.900 --> 15:43.901
[Diego] Whose turn is it?

15:43.984 --> 15:45.110
Oh, for...

15:54.912 --> 15:56.664
We're the only ones capable
of stopping this.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.958

to bring us back together.

was Ben.

16:35.244 --> 16:39.081
Today, he punched me in the face.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.875
And earlier at the house,
he was the one who saved Diego's life,

16:41.959 --> 16:42.793

And-- And the girl,
she thought he was a furry...

17:16.035 --> 17:17.453

-Okay.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.999

17:23.876 --> 17:26.503
Excuse me,
it's my son Kenny's birthday today, and...

17:26.587 --> 17:29.339
Uh... wouldn't your son be happier
playing with kids his own age?

18:41.537 --> 18:43.163
things really got out of hand.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.457

-But I'm willin' to forgive and forget.
-How very kind of you.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.967
Look, the Handler was right.
We had a chance to kill each other.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.802
We were ordered to kill each other.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.596
And we didn't. That says somethin', right?

19:00.055 --> 19:02.224
You're willin' to throw away
all that goodwill?

19:02.307 --> 19:03.392
Doesn't matter.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.936
The Handler's offer isn't real.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.479
Of course it is.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.440
Verbal agreements are binding.
Check the handbook.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.235
We've caused way too much trouble.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.165
Very well.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.639
My studies this evening pertain to music.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.892

-You can change that.
-Tonight, tomorrow.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.640
So little difference
in the scheme of things.

29:29.392 --> 29:32.228
Don't you remember
the Commission's raison d'être?

29:32.937 --> 29:37.817
What's meant to be is meant to be,
or, as I like to say, que será, será.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.069
It's bullshit in any language.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.447
Why did you call me here?

29:44.032 --> 29:45.533
I wanna offer you a choice.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.578
Everyone's going to die tonight, but...

29:49.454 --> 29:50.955
unlike the rest of the world,

29:51.956 --> 29:53.124
you have a way out.

29:53.917 --> 29:58.838
You can abandon your family
and skip ahead to the apocalypse,

29:58.922 --> 30:01.007
take a walkabout for a few decades,

30:01.090 --> 30:02.634
wondering if I'll come back

30:02.717 --> 30:04.344
and offer you a job again,

30:04.427 --> 30:06.429
or you can stay here,

30:07.430 --> 30:09.641
with your family, and...

30:10.391 --> 30:12.227
die a horrible death. [laughs]

-[cork pops loudly]
-While you weigh your options,

30:17.440 --> 30:21.152
just know your siblings
are fighting for their lives without you.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.238
[Five]
You brought me here to pull me away.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.615
[Handler] It's been nice knowing you,
Five.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.076

31:32.974 --> 31:34.767
Allison, I can't let you do that,
all right?

31:34.851 --> 31:36.978
-She's beyond reasoning.
-You hear the music?

31:37.061 --> 31:38.062
It's started.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.772
Do you honestly think she's gonna listen?

31:40.064 --> 31:41.608
After everything that's happened?

31:42.567 --> 31:44.235
[Klaus] We don't have time for this.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.446
Okay.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.706
You're using her as a distraction,
aren't you?

31:56.789 --> 31:58.958
-Our best chance to incapacitate Vanya.
-Oh.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.878
She'll thank us later.

32:01.961 --> 32:05.173
-[Klaus] So, what's the plan?
-[Luther] Uh, you wait out front.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.675
-What?
-Yeah, you're the lookout.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.719

32:39.707 --> 32:40.833
Back so soon?

32:45.088 --> 32:47.590
And here I thought you were the smart one.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.134
How disappointing.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.868
I'm sorry you had to see that.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.123
If you want to change your mind
about being with me,

33:21.541 --> 33:22.542
I understand.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.382
Everyone has a past.

-Yeah.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.630
Yeah. We're fine, thanks for asking.

35:33.047 --> 35:36.008
Look, I almost lost you once, all right?
I wasn't about to lose you again.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.511
Well, so much for the element
of surprise. What else you got?

35:41.556 --> 35:43.850
No shit, Allison. Tell us something
we don't already know.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.434
She's talking about the violin.

35:46.435 --> 35:47.562
It's her lightning rod.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.522
If we can take it from her

35:49.605 --> 35:51.149
and stop her from playing,
we might have a shot.

[orchestra screaming]

36:02.869 --> 36:05.329
What the hell happened to Klaus?
He's supposed to be on lookout.

36:05.413 --> 36:08.457
-Yeah, you surprised?
-What's with all the lollygagging?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.001

[Klaus] Come on, man,
we're the damn lookouts!

36:37.028 --> 36:39.071
Five, what the...
I thought you bailed on us!

36:39.155 --> 36:40.573
I had an errand to run.

36:41.657 --> 36:42.783
This is not good.

-Yeah, I do.

36:45.912 --> 36:46.746

36:47.955 --> 36:50.208
Well... we're screwed.

So, how do you wanna end this thing?

39:06.052 --> 39:07.470
[Luther] We surround her.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.139
All right? We come at her from all angles.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.390
So it's a suicide mission.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.143
Yeah, but one of us could get through.
It's the only chance we've got.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.603

-No.
