00:04.214 --> 00:06.216
[theme music playing]

00:14.933 --> 00:17.101
[Maria] <i>I'm a pterodactyl.</i>

00:17.644 --> 00:18.853
[Maria] [screaming]
<i>Corn!</i>

00:21.147 --> 00:22.649
[indistinct chatter]

00:23.566 --> 00:26.653
My ex-wife Barbara
is holding her first dinner party

00:26.736 --> 00:29.572
with her Venezuelan beloved, Ramon.

00:29.656 --> 00:30.907
Now let me ask you,

00:30.990 --> 00:33.826
shall I raise my arm to smite said lover?
No.

00:33.910 --> 00:36.162
For kindness shall be my sword.

00:36.246 --> 00:37.914
I'm really nervous to go in here.

00:37.997 --> 00:40.416
I'm terrible at parties.
I don't make small talk.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.336
I just wish I could be
one of those people who could

00:43.419 --> 00:48.591
[in fancy voice] talk about wine and...
and tennis and Mercedes Benzeseses.

00:48.675 --> 00:51.261
Don't overthink it, my queen.
Just relax, make jokes

00:51.344 --> 00:52.262
and we'll have fun.

00:52.345 --> 00:54.639
-Okay.
-Perhaps you and I will vamp a bit.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.518
My ex-wife will observe
the rapscallion wit that she has forsaken.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.728
[Maria] Isn't life funny?

01:00.812 --> 01:02.272
[all laughing]

01:03.314 --> 01:06.484
Anyway... you guys are crazy!

01:06.568 --> 01:08.861
[sighs] Oh, God.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.531
May I?

01:11.614 --> 01:14.909
[in fancy voice] Oh.
<i>Enchantée.</i> Well... [chuckles]

01:15.743 --> 01:18.997
[clears throat] Jack Tripper.
Wilkins and Marshall.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.874
Well, I'm not sure
how much of that is your name,

01:21.958 --> 01:23.459
but I am intrigued.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.713
Diane Winterbottommonte.

01:27.547 --> 01:30.008
Wathkins and Mytel.

01:30.091 --> 01:33.594
I'm a natural extrovert
and so this is a pleasure...

01:33.678 --> 01:35.096
pleasure meeting you.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.848
Do you love tennis as much as I do?

01:36.931 --> 01:39.017
Uh, maybe more.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.685
First doubles at Yale.

01:41.436 --> 01:44.230
This is gonna be a problem.
Harvard Lady Bobcat!

01:44.314 --> 01:46.316
-No.
-Class of I'll never tell.

01:46.399 --> 01:48.610
[both laughing]

01:48.693 --> 01:50.236
You are quite a spark plug.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.655
You know it.
How about these spark plugs?

01:52.739 --> 01:54.157
[laughing]

01:54.240 --> 01:55.575
Extrovert!

01:55.658 --> 01:58.328
-[chuckles] I really am.
-[sighs] Wow.

01:58.411 --> 01:59.704
[Maria] ...so I turn to Bono,

01:59.787 --> 02:02.165
and I say, "Bono, you crazy mick.

02:02.248 --> 02:05.793
You've been using the Kennedy girl's
tennis racket the whole time."

02:05.877 --> 02:07.378
[all laughing]

02:09.380 --> 02:10.923
[normal voice]
How do I get out of this voice?

02:11.007 --> 02:12.133
Stick with it.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.011
That guy over there is a big producer
with a TV show,

02:15.094 --> 02:16.304
<i>Locked Up Abroad.</i>

02:16.387 --> 02:18.931
He's gobbling up every gorgeous word.
Go on!

02:19.015 --> 02:21.392
People know me.
Barbara's met me before.

02:21.476 --> 02:24.562
My lady love is
otherwise engaged at the moment

02:24.687 --> 02:27.690
-with my Latin cuckolder.
-[Barbara] Come on, baby.

02:27.774 --> 02:28.816
[whispering] Come on...

02:28.900 --> 02:30.109
Oh.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.361
I can't do it anymore.

02:31.444 --> 02:33.696
I'm exhausted. I need a Sucrets.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.491
Hey, you guys? This is my real voice.

02:36.574 --> 02:38.576
I don't know anything about tennis

02:38.660 --> 02:41.954
and I actually enjoy
gas station tuna fish sandwiches.

02:42.038 --> 02:43.748
-Uh...
-[laughs]

02:43.831 --> 02:45.375
[all laughing]

02:46.834 --> 02:47.919
A regular Rich Little.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.589
God... [chuckles]
That shrill, horrible voice was hilarious!

02:51.672 --> 02:54.884
[in fancy voice] Can you imagine?
It's almost a disability.

02:54.967 --> 02:58.721
I bet I'd be eligible for a
handicapped parking placard for my Jag.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.681
[both laughing]

03:00.765 --> 03:03.226
But, hey, what are you...

03:03.309 --> 03:04.685
what are you into?

03:04.769 --> 03:05.978
What... turns you on?

03:06.062 --> 03:08.773
-What's your jam?
-[clicks tongue] You know,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.108
I like Coffee Bean...

03:10.191 --> 03:12.443
and <i>Big Bang Theory.</i>

03:13.236 --> 03:14.654
That is insane.

03:14.737 --> 03:18.241
Those are two of my favorite five things.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.243
Have you been to the beach?

03:21.786 --> 03:24.455
Yes, I have.

03:24.539 --> 03:26.207
-This is crazy.
-[sighs]

03:26.332 --> 03:28.000
[acoustic guitar music playing]

03:31.295 --> 03:32.797
[strumming ends abruptly]

03:35.216 --> 03:37.343
[in normal voice] Bruce,
this is very sexual.

03:37.427 --> 03:39.137
-We should go.
-You see that shirt?

03:39.220 --> 03:40.555
And those pants he's wearing?

03:40.638 --> 03:44.058
Those are mine.
Unconsciously, she yearns for me.

03:44.142 --> 03:46.853
And now she wants me to fight
to get her back.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.147
[Maria] Don't you think he's stealing
your expensive clothes?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.399
In that case, the joke's on him.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.734
-See that whole outfit?
-Yes.

03:52.817 --> 03:55.695
$11 from the Bruce Boxleitner collection
at Kohl's.

03:55.778 --> 03:57.363
Plus, double joke's on him.

03:57.447 --> 03:59.699
I had a rolling brown-out
in those slacks

03:59.782 --> 04:02.744
courtesy of Ron Popeil's
July Fourth ceviche bar.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.080
Well...
I think I better clean up some plates.

04:06.164 --> 04:08.374
Looks like Barbara's busy.

04:08.458 --> 04:10.668
[Maria] Yeah, I'm gonna go too.

04:10.752 --> 04:13.755
Mmm... that Diane voice
really wiped me out.

04:15.006 --> 04:16.632
Can I walk you to your car?

04:16.716 --> 04:17.759
Oh.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.428
[in fancy voice] Fantastic.
Wow, a gentleman.

04:21.512 --> 04:24.015
I thought you had all
gone the way of the dodo.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.434
-[both laughing]
-That's, uh...

04:27.226 --> 04:28.811
the extinct bird, right?

04:29.812 --> 04:31.314
-Yes.
-Oh.

04:31.397 --> 04:34.150
Well, I wish I had parked farther away.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.194
[both laughing]

04:36.277 --> 04:38.070
Why am I laughing?

04:38.154 --> 04:39.363
-[laughing]
-[Maria] I have

04:39.447 --> 04:41.073
an unearned sense of confidence.

04:41.157 --> 04:42.492
I really like you, Diane.

04:42.575 --> 04:47.163
Would you want to go to the beach
or maybe Coffee Bean sometime?

04:47.246 --> 04:51.083
Oh, well, that would be... fabulous.

04:51.167 --> 04:54.253
[in normal voice] Know what?
I've got to be honest with you.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.464
I fell into a Diane voice vortex.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.633
This is who I am. My name's Maria.

04:58.716 --> 05:02.386
I don't actually work for
Wathkins and whatever.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.846
-Mytel.
-Uh, right.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.557
I'm so sorry.

05:06.641 --> 05:07.809
I'm just a comedian.

05:07.892 --> 05:11.187
Oh. [chuckles] Comedy!
I love comedy.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.523
-Oh!
-Can't believe I didn't get the joke.

05:13.606 --> 05:16.901
When I have a glass of wine,
I lose my sense of humor, like everybody.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.530
And after a few drinks
everything just becomes... very real.

05:20.613 --> 05:22.949
And I tighten up and clench all over.

05:23.032 --> 05:25.076
I really pinch off.
Well, great meeting you.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.537
[in fancy voice] Guess
I'll just get into my Jag.

05:27.620 --> 05:31.082
Uh...
Would you wanna get coffee tomorrow?

05:31.165 --> 05:32.542
[in normal voice] Yes, sure.

05:32.625 --> 05:36.963
On second thought,
tomorrow actually won't work well for me.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.965
[in fancy voice]
How about tomorrow's tomorrow?

05:40.091 --> 05:44.428
Actually, now that I think about it...
I think tomorrow would actually work.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.932
Well... great. [laughing]

05:53.187 --> 05:55.731
So I met somebody. A really nice guy...

05:55.815 --> 05:57.316
-[Larissa gasps]
-...named Jack.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.819
-Uh-huh.
-[in fancy voice] We really hit it off

05:59.902 --> 06:01.696
when I was doing my Diane voice.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.365
I'd just gotten my pap smear
in my Mercedes.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.117
-All clear.
-[all laughing]

06:06.200 --> 06:09.829
[in normal voice] I'm worried that's
the only thing he likes about me,

06:09.912 --> 06:11.998
[in fancy voice]
the intoxicating voice.

06:12.081 --> 06:15.376
He definitely likes something that starts
with a V. Your pussy.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.628
-No, he's very nice.
-[Larissa] Is he hot?

06:17.712 --> 06:20.840
Does he have a powerful aura?
What do you like about him?

06:20.923 --> 06:23.259
He really likes me.
That's what I really like.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.720
But he only likes me
when I'm doing the voice.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.306
And that's a little weird.

06:28.389 --> 06:31.225
Nobody is themself
for the first six years of dating.

06:31.309 --> 06:33.102
That's science. That's proven.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.562
Everybody, when they start out,

06:34.687 --> 06:36.063
they put their best foot forward.

06:36.147 --> 06:38.816
-One step at a time, right?
-In the beginning. Yeah.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.067
Just shut up for a second.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.360
Listen, between you and me,

06:41.444 --> 06:46.032
I've done some humiliating shit for guys.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.867
I'm talking really humiliating shit.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.202
-[cell phone vibrating]
-[Maria] I know.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.204
I'd better...

06:52.288 --> 06:54.665
-I wanna see who this is.
-Get the phone.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.126
[in fancy voice] Go for Diane.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.004
What am I doing? [laughs]

07:00.087 --> 07:04.425
I am carbonating my pool
in my solid gold tankini

07:04.508 --> 07:05.926
and my belly chain.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.261
[laughs]

07:08.346 --> 07:09.513
I'd love to see you at the show.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.223
I'll get you tickets right up front.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.684
So close, you can see my pores
if I had any.

07:13.768 --> 07:16.562
[laughs] Okay, sweet pea.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.648
Squirrel kiss. Mmm!

07:18.731 --> 07:20.441
Mmm, yeah!

07:20.524 --> 07:21.734
Yeah...

07:24.445 --> 07:25.488
What the fuck was that?

07:26.364 --> 07:29.825
Forget everything I said before
because that was fucking disgusting.

07:29.909 --> 07:33.496
I once kissed a squirrel
in an ashram outside of Boulder.

07:33.579 --> 07:37.166
I was in the hospital for 16 weeks
and I learned my lesson.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.669
Now, I'm super careful
when I kiss squirrels.

07:42.755 --> 07:45.299
[Maria] <i>I was doing</i>
<i>my fancy voice to please Jack,</i>

07:45.383 --> 07:46.592
<i>but I had to be careful.</i>

07:46.676 --> 07:49.053
<i>People-pleasing got me</i>
<i>in trouble in the past,</i>

07:49.136 --> 07:51.055
<i>especially with my best friend from home,</i>

07:51.138 --> 07:52.473
Susan!

07:52.556 --> 07:54.308
Maria, I hope it's okay,

07:54.392 --> 07:58.479
I brought my real estate agent,
Karen Grisham, to watch.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.148
Karen Grisham?
That's the name of my talent agent.

08:01.232 --> 08:02.400
Maybe she's my sister.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.818
[both laugh]

08:03.901 --> 08:05.319
Isn't she funny, Maria?

08:05.403 --> 08:07.530
-Yeah...
-She should be the comedian.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.658
Maria is an alternative comedian.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.285
As in, alternative to funny.

08:13.369 --> 08:15.913
-[laughing]
-Oh, come on!

08:15.997 --> 08:18.666
Susan, you're busting my nards right now.

08:19.542 --> 08:23.379
So just so you know what I'm doing,
it's a cartoon based on SeaWorld

08:23.462 --> 08:25.131
and I play Lady Orca

08:25.214 --> 08:28.718
and it's starring and produced
by Dr. Bill Cosby...

08:28.801 --> 08:30.136
PhD.

08:30.219 --> 08:33.264
So Cosby, SeaWorld...
How could it miss? [chuckling]

08:34.097 --> 08:37.183
-Nobody cares, Ave Maria.
-[both laughing]

08:37.268 --> 08:38.394
Get to work, squirt.

08:38.936 --> 08:41.272
Another dooze from Sooze.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.940
[chuckling]

08:44.483 --> 08:46.152
[beeping]

08:49.030 --> 08:51.115
I escaped from
those Greenpeace kidnappers,

08:51.198 --> 08:54.285
and now I want to get back to my cozy tank

08:54.368 --> 08:58.497
where crowds adore me
and fish fall from the sky!

08:58.581 --> 09:00.291
Freedom is a burden!

09:00.374 --> 09:02.585
Let me in, Bill Cosby!

09:02.668 --> 09:04.503
Let me in!

09:04.587 --> 09:07.381
-Perfect, Maria. Thank you.
-Oh, okay.

09:07.465 --> 09:08.716
Thanks, Glenn.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.469
Okay, I'm done!

09:12.970 --> 09:14.180
-That's it?
-Yeah.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.264
That's all you do?

09:15.347 --> 09:16.974
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

09:17.058 --> 09:19.477
What a Freddie-freeloader.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.229
What do they pay you
to spit into a microphone?

09:22.313 --> 09:23.814
Oh, I'd rather not say.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.649
-$10,000.
-Okay.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.319
-Oh, my fudge on rye.
-Fuck my butt-titties.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.489
You make $10,000
for 30 seconds? [chuckles]

09:31.572 --> 09:33.491
What do the goobers
at Checklist give ya?

09:33.574 --> 09:35.826
-I don't know. It's--
-[Glenn] $150,000.

09:35.910 --> 09:36.911
-[Susan] What?
-Thanks, Glenn.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.914
[Maria] That is thanks to
the hardworking men and women

09:39.997 --> 09:41.290
of America's labor unions.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.751
Maybe I should show you houses.

09:43.834 --> 09:44.835
[Susan] Yeah!

09:44.919 --> 09:48.214
But first,
you gotta look at my super cute condo.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.508
It's my MTV crib. [exclaims]

09:51.383 --> 09:54.303
[Susan] <i>Paul and I have been dying</i>
<i>for a vacation home.</i>

09:54.386 --> 09:56.180
<i>You can use it anytime, Maria,</i>

09:56.263 --> 10:00.059
<i>because I'm your bestie</i>
<i>from the Midwestie.</i> [laughs]

10:00.142 --> 10:02.603
[Maria] <i>Oh, it's nice.</i>
<i>Congratulations, Susan.</i>

10:02.686 --> 10:04.105
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

10:04.230 --> 10:05.898
[Karen] <i>Check out these hardwood floors.</i>

10:05.981 --> 10:06.982
[Maria] <i>Okay.</i>

10:07.066 --> 10:09.026
Oh, are those pine?

10:09.110 --> 10:11.570
-[Karen] It's koa, it's endangered.
-[Maria] Okay.

10:11.654 --> 10:15.116
[Karen] <i>And this is</i>
<i>the 75-bottle wine fridge.</i>

10:15.199 --> 10:18.119
[Susan] <i>Paul loves wine.</i>
<i>That's my husband, Karen.</i>

10:18.202 --> 10:20.412
<i>-Maria doesn't have one.</i>
-[Maria] <i>Nope.</i>

10:20.496 --> 10:22.706
[Susan] <i>Anybody want nachos?</i>
[chuckles]

10:22.790 --> 10:23.999
[Maria] <i>You know what?</i>

10:24.083 --> 10:25.334
I feel like I'm gonna barf.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.044
Maybe we can get something to eat.

10:27.128 --> 10:29.463
These are just making me a little sick.

10:29.547 --> 10:31.590
See this?
This is what I have to deal with.

10:31.674 --> 10:34.343
We're spending time enjoying
something about me

10:34.426 --> 10:35.761
for a change and...

10:35.845 --> 10:38.597
it makes Eleanor Roose-selfish sick.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.100
Why don't we find you a new house
to vomit in?

10:41.183 --> 10:44.061
That's okay.
I just wanna go get some lunch or--

10:44.145 --> 10:46.355
Well, you're not gonna eat
until you buy a house.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.274
-Okay.
-We're doing this!

10:48.357 --> 10:49.775
Hi-ya!

10:51.861 --> 10:53.279
-[Karen sighs]
-[Maria gasps]

10:54.196 --> 10:57.283
-[intercom beeps]
-Gabe, tell them to bring another desk.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.450
I did it again.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.036
[Maria] Well, this is nice.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.746
It's definitely a house.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.082
<i>You will get much cock in this house.</i>

11:05.166 --> 11:07.543
-I'll get it.
-Maria wants something nicer.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.128
-Right, squirt?
-Oh.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.338
I guess.

11:11.422 --> 11:14.133
<i>Oh, fuck me running.</i>
<i>Let's go bigger!</i>

11:14.216 --> 11:15.843
-[chuckles]
<i>-Uh-oh. Got to go.</i>

11:15.926 --> 11:18.971
<i>Stamos needs a third fuck palace.</i>
<i>He's calling them "Bukake Condos."</i>

11:19.054 --> 11:20.306
Oh.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.891
<i>Bu-condos!</i>

11:22.808 --> 11:24.393
-[both laughing]
-I get it.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.812
[Karen] This house
is particularly attractive

11:26.896 --> 11:29.106
because the price
is so goddamn reasonable.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.983
-Okay.
-Why? Easy, murder.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.569
Don't normally show my clients
a homicide house.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.655
This is a gem.
This is a double homicide house.

11:36.739 --> 11:40.075
You know "The Woman Who Knew Too Much,"
the <i>Dateline</i> episode?

11:40.159 --> 11:44.163
They spent forever looking for the killers
and then the killers killed each other.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.290
You might want to look
across the street.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.292
Also reduced. Also murders.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.669
An eight-family hog butchering.
Know what they say,

11:50.753 --> 11:52.046
"You don't want the least murdery house

11:52.129 --> 11:53.464
on the most murdery street."

11:53.547 --> 11:55.633
-That's the real estate 4-1-1.
-Okay.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.427
Aw, Maria's too cheap to buy
such a nice joint.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.931
She's a real Miser Minnelli. [chuckles]

12:02.014 --> 12:03.307
I am not cheap.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.768
-[scoffs]
-I'm a member of Debtors Anonymous

12:05.893 --> 12:06.894
and I make good money.

12:06.977 --> 12:10.356
Especially now that I have Checklist.
[mutters] Your cradle-to-grave store.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.984
Well, as I said to
my husband's cock implant guy...

12:14.068 --> 12:15.945
Let's go bigger!

12:16.028 --> 12:17.821
Oh! [laughs]

12:17.905 --> 12:19.281
Ta-da!

12:20.699 --> 12:22.368
What is this?

12:22.451 --> 12:24.578
[screaming excitedly] It's a house!

12:24.662 --> 12:28.958
[in sing-song] I bought the house
you said I should buy.

12:29.041 --> 12:32.252
[in normal voice]
Look, it's got its own recording booth

12:32.336 --> 12:34.421
where I can do my voice-over work and--

12:34.505 --> 12:36.840
Are you flipping kidding me
right flipping now?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.425
Yeah, we did it!

12:39.426 --> 12:42.054
Up top! Whoo-hoo!

12:42.137 --> 12:43.597
I knew you'd gone Hollywood,

12:43.681 --> 12:46.767
but I never thought
you'd rub it in my face like this.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.561
I bought a nice condo out here
in Marina del Rey

12:49.687 --> 12:52.356
and I said that you could use it.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.651
And then you go and buy
a movie star mansion

12:55.734 --> 12:57.069
with a recording booth

12:57.152 --> 13:00.906
so you don't even have to leave the house
to make $10,000 per second.

13:00.990 --> 13:05.160
I thought this was gonna make you happy.
I didn't even want to buy this house.

13:05.244 --> 13:08.205
You want me to feel bad for you
'cause your house is too big?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.166
Kiss my keister!

13:14.545 --> 13:16.630
-[door slams shut]
-Susan?

13:17.673 --> 13:19.383
[breathing heavily]

13:27.182 --> 13:28.892
[audience cheering and applauding]

13:28.976 --> 13:31.562
[in fancy voice]
Hi, I'm Diane Winterbottommonte.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.272
Connecticut. [chuckles]

13:33.355 --> 13:35.357
You know what I hate

13:35.441 --> 13:36.483
about mountain skiing?

13:36.567 --> 13:39.862
Those double black diamond runs.
They let anybody on there.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.406
-It's like, "What?" [laughs]
-[audience laughing]

13:43.115 --> 13:44.158
[sighs]

13:44.241 --> 13:47.077
If you can't do a mogul,
you can't date one. I should know.

13:47.161 --> 13:48.704
I had sex near Donald Trump once.

13:48.787 --> 13:52.124
-[all laughing]
-Oh, is anyone relating?

13:52.207 --> 13:54.084
Thanks so much. Have a great night.

13:54.168 --> 13:57.504
-[applauding]
-[indistinct chatter]

13:58.756 --> 14:01.800
That was great.
So very, very, very hilarious.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.469
I'm so charged up just hearing you speak.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.512
[in normal voice]
I don't know. It felt kinda weird.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.765
-What would she say about it?
-Who?

14:07.848 --> 14:09.808
-Our friend Diane.
-[in fancy voice] Oh.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.811
She would say,
"If you don't like it, you can lump it.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.438
Do you like to lumpty lump?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.774
Let me dig
into your digital underground.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.651
Reference!" [laughing]

14:19.735 --> 14:21.236
-Hey, Maria.
-Hey.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.405
Hey, Patton, this is my friend Jack.

14:23.489 --> 14:24.656
Hey, Jack.

14:24.740 --> 14:25.866
How do you know this cunt?

14:25.949 --> 14:28.243
Whoa! Watch your fucking mouth, buddy.

14:28.327 --> 14:31.830
-Do we have a problem here?
-[chuckling] That's hilarious!

14:31.914 --> 14:33.832
-See you later, whore.
-Okay. [grunts]

14:33.916 --> 14:34.958
What an asshole.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.543
-What's his problem?
-[in normal voice] No.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.253
He's a good friend.
He's just...

14:38.337 --> 14:40.047
"Cunt" is a term of endearment.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.466
It's so bad, no one would ever say it.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.385
And so that's why you can say it.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.470
Oh.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.973
Cunt, cunt, cunt. Karate, karate.
Rancho Cucamonga.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.352
Is that why it's funny?
Because cunt has a "K" sound?

14:53.435 --> 14:56.647
[in fancy voice] It might be better
if you just stop talking.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.233
[chuckles] You know what I'd love to do?

14:59.316 --> 15:03.028
Is I'd love to open up
a box of Chardonnay,

15:03.112 --> 15:05.280
read aloud from a <i>Woman's Day</i> magazine...

15:05.364 --> 15:07.282
and sit on your face.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.034
Fuck you, cunt.

15:09.118 --> 15:10.494
You're coming on a little hot,

15:10.577 --> 15:13.080
but I like where your head's at.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.624
[Jack] If we were at a party
with your parents,

15:15.707 --> 15:17.418
and I brought you a drink and said,

15:17.501 --> 15:19.711
"Here's your gin and tonic,
you dirty ax gash."

15:19.795 --> 15:22.214
Okay, no.
Oh, that's rough.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.882
I would not be okay with that.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.593
Jeez, Louise. I just don't get comedy.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.637
[in fancy voice] Don't worry. Just...

15:28.720 --> 15:30.848
take off your shirt, handsome. Hmm?

15:30.931 --> 15:32.141
Is the word "taint" funny?

15:32.224 --> 15:34.643
Shh, baby bear.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.395
No more words.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.897
-Let's just relax.
-[unzipping]

15:40.000 --> 15:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:48.657 --> 15:52.327
I'm sorry. I can't focus.
I can't stop thinking about Patton.

15:52.411 --> 15:54.455
[in normal voice] You're, like,
the fifth guy to say that

15:54.538 --> 15:56.331
while I'm enjoying intimacy with them.

15:56.415 --> 15:57.708
[sighs]

15:57.791 --> 15:59.877
[in fancy voice] I can't stop thinking
about Patton either.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.087
Pattin' your bottom...

16:02.171 --> 16:03.297
with my tongue.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.756
Forget comedy.
Just keep talking.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.801
So I'm in the lobby
of the Peninsula Hong Kong,

16:07.885 --> 16:10.345
and the Sultan of Brunei
leaves me another voicemail.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.139
I don't know if you know him.
He's very hairy.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.223
You don't get that over the phone.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.517
Anyway, more to come.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.781
Well, great news.

16:29.865 --> 16:33.535
Barbara asked me to keep all my pants
and my bike at the house.

16:33.619 --> 16:37.498
Ramon will be using them,
but it's a step in the right direction.

16:37.581 --> 16:41.877
And now for even better news,
you booked the pilot for <i>Lock Up A Broad.</i>

16:41.960 --> 16:44.379
Here's the rub.
You have to use the Diane voice.

16:44.463 --> 16:48.008
The pilot?
Isn't <i>Locked Up Abroad</i> on the air?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.594
Ah, yes, correct.
I was similarly confounded.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.054
The show of which I speak,

16:52.137 --> 16:56.892
<i>Lock Up A Broad,</i> is a wonderful show
where women are put inside a box

16:56.975 --> 16:58.936
and they have
an opportunity to apologize

16:59.019 --> 17:01.647
to a spouse or a lover,

17:01.730 --> 17:03.982
for valuable grand prizes.

17:04.066 --> 17:07.069
The whole thing
is rather ironic, which I know you enjoy,

17:07.152 --> 17:09.530
and it does shine a whimsical light

17:09.613 --> 17:12.156
on the very real problem
of female slavery.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.992
Bruce... I don't think I'm into it.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.162
It sounds very misogynistic.

17:17.246 --> 17:20.207
-They give prizes, Maria!
-Yeah, I can't do it.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.290
Wait a second, Maria.

17:21.375 --> 17:24.836
Have I ever begged you
to do anything before?

17:24.920 --> 17:25.921
Yes.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.757
Speaking of me on my knees,
I got to get out of that dorm room.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.261
Since Barbara kicked me out,
I've been living in a dorm room.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.555
The gentlemen of Meta Beta
are anything but gentle.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.014
They call me "Shower Bear."

17:36.098 --> 17:37.474
They pass me around.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.436
One time, I came back from my room to find

17:41.520 --> 17:43.855
a full human shit inside my Mets hat.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.357
-[gasps]
-"Put it on," they said.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.402
Tears weren't the only thing
running down my face that day.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.695
Oh, my God, Bruce.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.614
Why are you putting yourself
in this situation?

17:52.698 --> 17:55.033
I have to, Maria.
These guys are my brothers.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.787
You can come and stay with me,
just until you get back on your feet.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.249
That's very kind,
but I can never burden a client like that.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.127
Allow me to just force you
to take this job, okay?

18:05.210 --> 18:06.503
I need the commission.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.505
-I've got to get out of there.
-Oh.

18:08.589 --> 18:11.925
I need a safe place to close my eyes.

18:12.009 --> 18:15.137
[groans] Okay, fine. I'll do it.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.556
But you have to call the police.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.224
No! No cops.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.310
Mikey P. was very clear on that.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.438
[smooth jazz music playing]

18:24.521 --> 18:25.814
Very clear.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.414
Do you hear that?

18:46.418 --> 18:47.419
Yes.

18:48.337 --> 18:51.340
You'd be angry too if someone
stole your honey and nectar.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.507
[all laughing]

18:52.591 --> 18:56.595
[in mock accent] "My wife, she has
vageen like a sleeve of wizard."

18:56.678 --> 18:58.597
-Borat!
-[all laughing]

19:01.183 --> 19:03.477
[man] So I went on a cruise
before work.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.355
-A snooze cruise.
-[all laughing]

19:06.438 --> 19:08.649
Only lasts eight minutes.

19:08.732 --> 19:11.568
-Snooze button!
-[all laughing]

19:11.652 --> 19:13.695
Isn't Danny hilarious?

19:13.779 --> 19:16.823
Yeah, it was well-crafted
because he had left the surprise

19:16.907 --> 19:18.784
at the end that it was an alarm clock.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.204
Hey, Maria, I hear you're
a semi-famous stand-up comic.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.081
Why don't you tell us a joke?

19:24.164 --> 19:27.209
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I don't think so. No.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.710
Don't be scared.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.379
Comedy is lots of fun.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.548
Just have a unique take
on a universal truth.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.760
People love it. Even Donald.
And he's deaf.

19:37.678 --> 19:38.845
I'm deaf.

19:39.554 --> 19:43.225
[woman] Please tell us a joke. Please?
We want to hear what a real,

19:43.308 --> 19:45.686
-professional Hollywood joke sounds like.
-Okay.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.145
Please?

19:47.229 --> 19:48.313
Please.

19:48.397 --> 19:50.482
"Yeah, baby, yeah!"
Come on, new girl.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.402
I've warmed up the crowd for you.
Austin Powers. Yeah!

19:53.485 --> 19:54.695
[all laughing]

19:54.778 --> 19:56.697
Okay, well, um...

19:56.780 --> 19:59.116
Uh... I was thinking about having kids.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.742
Uh, got the names picked out.

20:00.826 --> 20:04.413
They're gonna be Donut
and the Golden Hen.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.664
I know what you're saying,

20:05.747 --> 20:08.333
"How do you know they're gonna be girls?"

20:08.417 --> 20:10.335
But a mother knows.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.587
A mother knows.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.345
Let's get back to work, huh?

20:20.429 --> 20:22.514
-Wanna get some lunch?
-No, I hate lunch.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.141
Said no one ever.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.726

20:32.691 --> 20:35.819

[Danny] "I'm a wild and crazy guy!"

20:40.991 --> 20:43.493
Sorry, excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Bamford.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.996
Is she back--
Oh, good. Maria.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.914
Hi, it's Mom. How are you?

20:47.998 --> 20:51.251
Oh, that nose gag is very funny.
[chuckles] I like that.

20:51.334 --> 20:54.129
-Yeah, okay.
-Sweetie, I brought you your tampons.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.881
You forgot 'em.

20:55.964 --> 20:59.259
Oh, God, Mom.
You aren't supposed to be here at work.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.094
I'm trying to get people to like me.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.512
People don't think I'm funny.

21:02.596 --> 21:06.349
Don't look to other people
for approval, Maria.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.269
Don't do that. No.
Get it from yourself.

21:09.352 --> 21:13.565
But that's literally what stand-up is.
It's looking for approval from strangers.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.275
-You're thinking too much.
-Okay.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.735
Just do the work.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.071
-Put these tampies in your bag.
-Okay.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.491
-All right, sweetie, have a good day.
-Thanks.

21:22.574 --> 21:25.035
[Danny] "Excuse me,
can I 'ass' you a question?"

21:25.118 --> 21:27.579

-Ace Ventura!

21:27.662 --> 21:30.207
He looks like he's going dirty.
I have to...

21:30.290 --> 21:31.500
Go for it. Go for it.

21:31.583 --> 21:32.876
Hey, you guys!

21:32.959 --> 21:35.921
[stutters]
I just ran into a tape dispenser.

21:36.713 --> 21:39.758
[chuckles] Is that something
people can relate to?

21:39.841 --> 21:41.259
Goddamn it.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.844
[whispers] Goddamn it.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.930
[stutters] Never mind. As you were.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.306

21:47.307 --> 21:48.892
Nothing to see here. [chuckles]

22:09.204 --> 22:10.205

22:11.122 --> 22:13.583
-Hey, hey!
-Hey, hey, making copies.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.043
You still working?

22:15.126 --> 22:16.920
Oh, is the... is the day over?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.338
A bunch of us
are headed over to Cozies.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.216
Open mic night tonight.
Rumor is I'm going to kill it.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.593
Half-price crappetizers.
You wanna go?

22:23.677 --> 22:26.054
Well, you know,
I think I'm gonna stay here,

22:26.137 --> 22:29.683
keep doing this.
The day went so fast.

22:29.766 --> 22:33.562
Data entry is almost like a meditation.
I stopped thinking.

22:33.645 --> 22:37.566
It's like you just type it and it...
and you put it in there.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.110
That's what she said.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.196
-Oh, behave! [chuckles]

22:43.280 --> 22:44.823
-Okay.
-Lates.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.866
-Mmm. "Thriller."
-Oh.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.411
Yeah, that was like...

22:49.494 --> 22:50.912
That was like...

22:52.455 --> 22:57.085

<i>Austin Powers</i> and then...

22:58.753 --> 23:00.297

23:01.131 --> 23:02.257
It's cool.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.136
-[Larissa exclaiming]
-[Maria] Yeah.

23:06.219 --> 23:09.472
-How's it going with that Jack guy?
-Well, it is going great.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.557
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.393
Are you still doing that
kooky rich lady voice

23:13.476 --> 23:15.312
to ignite his pelvic chakra?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.188
[in fancy voice] This one? Why, of course.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.190
I knew your skin was looking better.

23:19.274 --> 23:22.360
-[in normal voice] Yeah.
-Finally, Maria has intercourse.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.988
-[both] Aw!
-Everything but.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.406
What I've discovered is that

23:26.489 --> 23:29.326
it's not important to get my needs met,
and get it done.

23:29.409 --> 23:33.663
It's about meeting the needs
of the other person who I am into.

23:34.497 --> 23:35.832
So you're blowing him?

23:35.915 --> 23:38.168
I'm not gonna tell you that. But, yes!

23:40.420 --> 23:41.755
Okay.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.256
All right. Hey, guys!

23:43.340 --> 23:45.050
-What up? What up, Maria?
-Keith, Kenny, what's going on?

23:45.133 --> 23:46.760
-Clickedy-clink.
-Clickedy-clink.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.429
[all] Clink, clink, clink, clink!

23:49.512 --> 23:52.766
Clink, clink, clink, clickedy-clink.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.559
[all] Clickedy-clink.

23:54.643 --> 23:55.935
[all] Clink!

23:56.019 --> 23:57.687
-[softly] Wow.
-What's up?

23:57.771 --> 23:59.522
I thought this was a comics brunch?

23:59.606 --> 24:01.483
-Nobody's Periscoping.
-No Periscoping.

24:01.566 --> 24:03.735
Oh, I know. I know.
It's... We're old.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.987
You're the only millennials we know.
Sorry.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.197
-Mmm.
-Thanks for the invite.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.616
-Yeah.
-The donut holes were to die for.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.034
[both] It's our cheat day.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.869
Oh! You guys shouldn't be on a diet.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.037
-Clink.
-Clink, clink!

24:14.120 --> 24:15.914
I love brunch. It's so fun!

24:15.997 --> 24:18.375
-Hey!
-Hey! Guess who's all over my funny bone?

24:18.458 --> 24:19.542
-What? Who?
-Kindler.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.752
-Oh.
-That guy's my cunt.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.379
We're going fishing this weekend.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.339
That is great! Oh! [chuckles]

24:24.464 --> 24:27.884
I think we need a little work
on the usage of the "C" word, but...

24:27.967 --> 24:31.179
But... I'm so glad
you're fitting in with my comedy friends.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.181
And... and Kindler.

24:33.264 --> 24:36.768
[in fancy voice] I think you've
earned yourself a first-class,

24:36.851 --> 24:40.563

24:43.900 --> 24:45.318
Mmm!

24:49.030 --> 24:51.533
[in fancy voice] Rhonda thinks
she wasn't out of line

24:51.616 --> 24:53.034
when she didn't wanna make dinner

24:53.118 --> 24:56.705
for Randy and all of his bowling buddies
after the big tournament.

24:56.788 --> 25:00.625
Sounds like Randy bowled
a gutter ball when choosing a wife.

25:01.793 --> 25:05.880
Let's see how smart her mouth is
after three days without sunlight,

25:05.964 --> 25:12.095

25:13.888 --> 25:16.766

I can't do this.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.309
This voice is exhausting.

is this a metaphor?

25:27.527 --> 25:29.904
Here, read the menu... as Diane.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.906
Oh! I can't do it.
I can't do it.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.202
I've just been doing it all day.
I kinda... I'm a little drained, so...

25:36.286 --> 25:39.247
You're drained?
I went on a fishing trip with Kindler.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.832
I had to fake laugh for three days.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.959
I thought you thought he was funny.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.962
Listen, there's something
you need to know about me.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.881
I don't think anything is funny.

25:47.964 --> 25:48.923
I hate laughing.

25:49.007 --> 25:51.468
If there's a kid who can't add,
that's one thing.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.261
That's genuinely amusing.

25:53.344 --> 25:57.348
But the sound that comes out,
it upsets me. I hate it.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.935
[sighs] Why did you
go on the fishing trip?

26:01.019 --> 26:03.605
I was faking having a sense of humor...

26:03.688 --> 26:04.939
for you.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.900
And I've been doing this voice...

26:10.528 --> 26:11.613
It's okay.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.615
We like each other, and so...

26:13.698 --> 26:17.494

Come on, man,
you just farted for, like, 30 seconds.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.836
It's a normal bodily function.
I've been holding in for an hour.

27:07.919 --> 27:11.005

27:11.881 --> 27:15.176
Okay, maybe this isn't
gonna work out, you know.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.220
Maybe we've run our course.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.931

You said I could be myself.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.474
No...

27:22.767 --> 27:26.271

you didn't laugh after you passed gas.

each other one last time?
