WEBVTT

00:00.014 --> 00:03.006
You have a guest on the estate
who's an assassin's target.

00:03.084 --> 00:07.418
We just don't want anything to happen to the
brigadier. That's all you need to know.

00:11.292 --> 00:15.353
What are those turkeys
with automatic weapons doing here?

00:15.429 --> 00:18.469
- I'm afraid we have to take a few
precautions. - I just wanna get some sun...

00:18.499 --> 00:21.764
after flying all night and
being subjected to a body search.

00:21.836 --> 00:25.602
Body search? Higgins?

00:30.144 --> 00:35.605
- Ahoy there! This is a private beach, and you are
trespassing. - "" Ahoy there." That's very good.

00:37.017 --> 00:40.544
- What's he doing?
- Magnum, you idiot!

00:40.621 --> 00:44.284
We got a dead man who can't tell
us why he's here, who sent him...

00:44.358 --> 00:48.818
You can't go around telling everybody
everything. Tell 'em what they need to know.

00:48.896 --> 00:51.729
Otherwise, people might find out
what really is going on here.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.961
Hey!

00:55.035 --> 00:57.060
Mandy, get out of there.
Get out of there! What?

00:57.138 --> 01:00.005
Just get out of there.!

02:03.470 --> 02:07.566
In Belfast, Northern Ireland,

02:07.641 --> 02:10.838
where a bomb blast
destroyed an office building last Tuesday,

02:10.911 --> 02:15.746
a special task force under the command
of Brigadier General Alistair Folkes...

02:15.816 --> 02:20.913
brought about the mass arrest
of dozens of suspected I.R.A. terrorists.

02:20.988 --> 02:24.890
While many protested in the street against
the alleged use of strong-arm tactics...

02:24.959 --> 02:29.726
and the questioning of prisoners,
the results were undeniably successful,

02:29.797 --> 02:33.858
as General Folkes disclosed the capture
of two top I.R.A. leaders,

02:33.934 --> 02:35.993
Pat Farnsworth and Tim Barstow.

02:36.070 --> 02:42.009
The unofficial word is that the I.R.A. has
sworn to retaliate against General Folkes.

02:42.076 --> 02:44.135
The official word is... silence.

02:44.211 --> 02:47.271
Yes, Mr. Masters?

02:47.348 --> 02:52.786
As a matter of fact, I was watching a news
report about my former commander on the telly.

02:52.853 --> 02:58.291
Fascinating. Rest assured, sir. I've made all the
necessary arrangements. Nothing has been left to chance.

02:58.359 --> 03:02.728
Oh, I've taken the liberty of transferring those
two lovely stewardesses to the guesthouse.

03:02.796 --> 03:06.892
Were undeniably successful, as General
Folkes disclosed the capture last Tuesday.

03:06.967 --> 03:11.700
The general, it seems, has disappeared. We needn't
worry about Magnum. He's off on one of his cases...

03:11.772 --> 03:13.763
and won't be back for another week.

03:36.897 --> 03:40.162
Higgins had changed
the frequency to open the main gate.

03:40.234 --> 03:43.465
Now, I can usually take his silly games,
but not this morning.

03:43.537 --> 03:47.598
I was tired. My muscles ached
from squatting in the brush all night.

03:47.675 --> 03:50.143
No. You don't wanna know
what the case was.

03:50.210 --> 03:54.874
And all I wanted was
to climb into bed and get some sleep.

04:21.007 --> 04:24.444
Zeus? Apollo?

04:25.813 --> 04:28.213
Hi, guys.

04:47.634 --> 04:49.795
Aah.

04:51.405 --> 04:54.533
First the main gate
and now the guesthouse.

04:54.608 --> 04:58.908
Higgins was trying to tell me something.
It was coming across loud and clear.

05:02.516 --> 05:07.715
Work the lock.
Keep working the lock.

05:12.826 --> 05:16.125
Hi, guys.

05:19.666 --> 05:25.161
What the hell's going on here? Hey, look. If
you just tell me what you're lookin' for...

05:25.239 --> 05:29.198
Get out of my stuff. You got no right
to get in my stuff. Hi.

05:29.276 --> 05:33.042
Where are those dogs? And where's Higgins?
What the hell did you do with Higgins?

05:33.113 --> 05:35.946
What's going on here?
That's what I said!

05:42.055 --> 05:45.286
Oh, yes. Magnum.
Yes. You can let him go.

05:45.359 --> 05:48.522
I'm sorry, Mr. Magnum.
I hadn't realized. You belong here.

05:48.595 --> 05:51.462
You're damn right I do.
Now, who the hell are you?

05:51.532 --> 05:55.434
My name's Folkes,
Brigadier, British Army.

05:55.502 --> 05:59.871
I'm sorry about this, but I'm afraid we have
to take a few precautions while I'm here.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.170
It won't happen again.

06:10.150 --> 06:13.051
Higgins!
Magnum, what are you doing here?

06:13.120 --> 06:16.385
What am I doing here? What are those
turkeys with automatic weapons doing here?

06:16.457 --> 06:20.291
Brigadier Folkes is a guest of Robin Masters.
Those men are his security personnel.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.261
I don't care who the hell they are.
They got no right to search my stuff.

06:23.330 --> 06:26.697
I feel like I parachuted
into East Berlin.

06:26.767 --> 06:30.726
What the hell's going on here anyway? They are
Robin Masters's guests here for the weekend.

06:30.804 --> 06:36.640
- That's all you need to know. - Robin's taste in
houseguests is beginning to slip, if you ask me.

06:36.710 --> 06:42.080
Here are the extra towels I thought you
might need. Sorry about all the confusion.

06:42.149 --> 06:45.118
These ladies fly for Pan Pacific.
They are also Robin's guests.

06:45.185 --> 06:48.916
- I didn't expect you back, so I put them
up in the guesthouse. - Hi. I'm Tom Magnum.

06:48.989 --> 06:52.584
Welcome to Stalag 17. I... No offense. I
didn't mean you, about the houseguests.

06:52.659 --> 06:56.254
Hi. I'm Mandy. This is Suzie. You must be
the private eye that Robin told us about.

06:56.330 --> 07:01.029
Well, I prefer to be called private
investigator. You prefer to be called, period.

07:02.202 --> 07:04.932
Bet you're just coming back from a case.
I can't wait to hear all about it.

07:05.005 --> 07:08.065
Mandy, I hate to break this up,
but Magnum looks bushed.

07:08.141 --> 07:13.169
Besides, I just wanna get some sun after flying
all night and being subjected to a body search.

07:13.247 --> 07:15.772
Body search?

07:15.849 --> 07:17.942
Higgins?

07:23.891 --> 07:29.454
Well, since we only have one bed,
I recommend we sleep in shifts.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.998
I volunteer for the first one.

07:37.671 --> 07:40.265
A body search?

07:42.109 --> 07:44.100
Huh.

08:03.497 --> 08:05.658
Hello? Hello? Thomas, you there?

08:05.732 --> 08:08.257
Hello? Hello.

08:08.335 --> 08:12.032
Are you all right? You sound like my dog that
time she got hit by the pineapple truck.

08:12.105 --> 08:14.869
Yeah. No.

08:14.942 --> 08:17.410
Who is this? What do you
mean, "" Who is this?"

08:17.477 --> 08:21.208
How many people do you know that had a
dog that was hit by a pineapple truck?

08:21.281 --> 08:23.943
Come on. Get up.
It's almost noon.

08:24.017 --> 08:27.919
Look, I didn't hit the rack
till a couple hours ago.

08:27.988 --> 08:31.116
Throw some water on it and shake your tail.
I got some business for you.

08:31.191 --> 08:34.558
Okay. Tell you what. just take their number,
and I'll call 'em later, all right?

08:34.628 --> 08:39.565
Stop with the plea bargaining, okay? I got a bar bill here with
your name on it that reads like a Swiss bank account number.

08:40.933 --> 08:44.062
Okay. Look. I tell you what.

08:44.136 --> 08:48.870
You just give me a couple
of minutes to wake up,

08:48.942 --> 08:50.876
and I'll go take a couple of laps, okay?

08:50.944 --> 08:54.778
Forget the laps and
backstroke your way over here, okay?

08:54.848 --> 08:58.909
Rick, there's one thing
you've got to learn.

08:58.986 --> 09:04.049
The human body is very important.
I will see you after my dip.

09:09.963 --> 09:12.625
He'll be here in a while. A while?
And what's a while?

09:12.699 --> 09:15.634
A while, okay? A while.

09:15.702 --> 09:17.727
A while.

09:30.684 --> 09:35.246
Whoo. That creep still there?

09:37.524 --> 09:41.255
Oh, I think he's harmless. I
think he got his nickel's worth.

09:51.738 --> 09:56.698
I hate these cretins who think a suntan
and a hairy chest makes them superstud.

09:58.345 --> 10:00.438
Hi. Hi.

10:00.514 --> 10:03.677
Hi. My shift in the
bedroom, Magnum?

10:03.750 --> 10:05.775
Be my guest.

10:05.852 --> 10:08.514
I'll catch up with you.

10:08.588 --> 10:11.352
How's your swim? Good.

10:13.026 --> 10:18.658
I still can't believe you're a real live
detective. Your life must be a thrill a minute.

10:18.732 --> 10:23.897
Like this morning. If they'd grabbed me like
that, I... I would've been scared to death.

10:23.970 --> 10:28.304
Oh, well, you learn
to handle those things in due course.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.309
Tom? Yeah?

10:30.377 --> 10:33.972
Do you think you'll do any "detectiving"
while I'm here? "Detectiving"?

10:34.047 --> 10:38.609
Yeah. I'd love a chance
to see what you do in action.

10:38.685 --> 10:42.416
I don't whip off my glasses and run into
the phone booth, if that's what you mean.

10:42.489 --> 10:46.425
Not if it's a pay phone, anyway.

10:47.961 --> 10:50.930
Higgins, that is my camera.
It's Robin's camera, not yours.

10:50.997 --> 10:53.761
But he left it in my care.
I am responsible for it.

10:55.102 --> 10:58.868
I can't imagine
your being responsible for anything.

11:00.373 --> 11:03.706
Ahoy there! Ahoy there!

11:03.777 --> 11:07.770
"" Ahoy there." That's very good.

11:07.848 --> 11:12.148
You are sailing a restricted area.
A restricted area.

11:12.219 --> 11:15.552
This is a private beach,
and you are trespassing.

11:15.622 --> 11:20.150
Higgins, you developed my film. These
pictures are evidence in a divor...

11:20.227 --> 11:22.855
in a case I'm working on...
and confidential.

11:22.929 --> 11:26.797
Oh, is that what they call those kinds of
pictures now? It's called personal property,

11:26.867 --> 11:30.462
and I'd appreciate it if you'd tell your
yo-yos to keep their hands off it from now on.

11:30.537 --> 11:33.995
If you wish to put yourself up
off the grounds until they leave...

11:34.074 --> 11:36.804
No, I didn't think so.

11:36.877 --> 11:42.281
Well, as long as you're remaining with us, you're
invited to dinner this evening at the main house. I am?

11:42.349 --> 11:47.150
Brigadier General Alistair Folkes has graciously invited
all of Robert Masters's guests to dine with him tonight.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.814
That, quite amazingly,
includes you.

11:50.924 --> 11:56.624
Oh, and we dress for dinner, Magnum. That means
a white dinner jacket and tie, of course.

11:56.696 --> 11:58.721
Of course.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.600
Of course.

12:07.841 --> 12:12.505
Smile, Brigadier.
It'll look good on your obituary.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.161
Is that a new song, Reri?

12:36.236 --> 12:39.672
Just tuning up, Rick.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.139
Magnum.

12:47.347 --> 12:50.214
I thought you said a morning dip. You could've
dog-paddled across the English Channel by now.

12:50.283 --> 12:53.514
I said I'd be here. I'm here. Is. T.C.
around yet? T.C. isn't around,

12:53.587 --> 12:56.249
and there's a guy upstairs
in my office waiting since 11:00.

12:56.323 --> 12:58.791
That's no way to run a business. Really,
Thomas. What's he interested in?

12:58.859 --> 13:00.793
I don't know. Let's find out.
Hey, Thomas, Rick.

13:00.861 --> 13:04.160
Oh. T.C.
Hey, nice-lookin' crowd.

13:04.231 --> 13:08.668
Whoa. Nice-lookin' crowd indeed. Whoo.
That's great. You brought it, huh?

13:08.735 --> 13:14.571
Oh, yeah. Hey, man. This is
guaranteed to make the ladies swoon.

13:14.641 --> 13:18.236
This baby has seen more action
than Muhammad Ali.

13:18.311 --> 13:21.303
What is this? The tailor shop?

13:23.850 --> 13:26.045
Well?

13:26.119 --> 13:28.314
Geez. I don't know.
It's a little short in the sleeves.

13:28.388 --> 13:32.051
All right. So you're a little taller than I am. Just don't reach
for the salt, and it'll fit pretty good in the shoulders.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.889
Good. He'll take it. Wrap it up. Let's go.
No. Wait. I mean, I don't know, T.C.

13:34.961 --> 13:38.920
Oh, you ever tried pricing one of these?
Oh, no. It's okay. It's okay.

13:38.999 --> 13:41.832
I just... See, I don't wanna ruin it. But
I'm only gonna wear it this one night.

13:41.902 --> 13:44.234
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't
wanna know any more about it.

13:44.304 --> 13:47.068
Next thing I know, you'll have me
involved in one of your crazy cases.

13:47.140 --> 13:49.199
See this jacket? Yeah.

13:49.276 --> 13:52.268
I want it back just the way
you got it, okay? Right.

13:52.345 --> 13:55.337
Later, Rick. Thanks, T.C.
I owe you one.

13:58.485 --> 14:03.855
We have reason to believe that Brigadier General Folkes
may experience some difficulty with the I.R.A...

14:03.924 --> 14:07.052
while he's here, so we would like
you to sort of keep an eye on things...

14:07.127 --> 14:10.062
you know, internal surveillance
while he's out there on the estate.

14:10.130 --> 14:13.725
And considering your position,
that shouldn't raise any eyebrows.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.291
Somehow I get the impression
we're talking about British eyebrows.

14:16.369 --> 14:20.305
We just don't want anything to happen to the
brigadier. That's all you need to know.

14:20.373 --> 14:24.104
Not if you want my help,
it's not.

14:24.177 --> 14:27.510
Come on, Hooker. Give it to 'im straight. I
wanna get outta here and get somethin' to eat.

14:27.580 --> 14:32.108
- My stomach's really startin' to act up. - Here.
You can order lunch right here, my friend.

14:32.185 --> 14:34.483
I think that can wait.

14:34.554 --> 14:38.581
You see, as far as Northern Ireland is
concerned, our British cousins are a bit touchy.

14:38.658 --> 14:41.957
We've offered them our help, and they
have said thanks, but no, thanks.

14:42.028 --> 14:44.258
So, officially, this is hands-off.

14:44.331 --> 14:48.791
But we do not want a repeat of the
Mountbatten affair in our own backyard.

14:48.868 --> 14:52.269
How 'bout just a glass of orange juice or
something? Orange juice is three dollars.

14:52.339 --> 14:54.807
That's for the large.
It's only two dollars for the small.

14:54.874 --> 14:57.206
You guys lose your wallets
or something?

14:57.277 --> 15:00.212
You can't put three dollars
for orange juice on an expense account.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.373
I thought Uncle Sam
paid for all that stuff.

15:02.449 --> 15:06.180
With the budget cuts we've had, we're lucky
they didn't send us out here in a canoe.

15:06.252 --> 15:11.884
Uh, this is Magnum. Could you send up an orange
juice, please? Yeah. A large. Thank you.

15:11.958 --> 15:16.452
- Don't worry. It's on me.
- Thanks, Magnum.

15:16.529 --> 15:21.899
What makes you think they're gonna
try for him here? I didn't say that.

15:23.103 --> 15:27.464
I think they'd find it much easier to hit him on his own
territory. Unless he's too heavily guarded back there.

15:27.474 --> 15:31.410
Well, what do you say, Magnum? Are you in?
For 200 a day plus expenses.

15:31.478 --> 15:35.244
$200 a day? What are you trying to do?
Rip off your own government?

15:35.315 --> 15:40.184
I don't do that, but goodwill doesn't keep the
finance companies and the landlords off my back.

15:40.253 --> 15:43.518
What's fair is fair. just drink
your orange juice, will you?

15:43.590 --> 15:47.549
$200 a day is one hell of a lot of money.
Not if you only work 10 days a year.

15:47.627 --> 15:50.152
Oh, all right. All right.
200 a day.

15:50.230 --> 15:54.189
And for that kind of money, we get periodic
check-ins every two hours. Every six hours.

15:54.267 --> 15:57.065
All right. I'll give you a number. You
can reach us 24 hours a day. Right.

15:57.137 --> 16:01.574
Uh, look, while you guys are taking in the
sun, there's something that you might check.

16:01.641 --> 16:04.109
There was a guy buzzing the shoreline
on a catamaran today.

16:04.177 --> 16:07.840
He had a camera or some binoculars.
It looked like a custom-made sail.

16:07.914 --> 16:11.281
- A white gull on the setting sun.
- That sounds like it's worth checking out.

16:11.351 --> 16:14.013
$200 worth it's not,
but it's something.

16:14.087 --> 16:18.183
- Just let me know what you find out, okay,
Hooker? - Oh, yeah. We'll keep in touch.

16:18.258 --> 16:21.489
- Come on, Dobey.
- Thanks again, Magnum.

16:21.561 --> 16:24.155
Right. I need something to
eat and a place to lay down,

16:24.230 --> 16:28.394
and don't think I'm not gonna complain,
spending all night at the airport.

16:28.468 --> 16:31.494
Do me a favor, will ya, Rick? You
want a make on the catamaran.

16:31.571 --> 16:35.166
Right. What's the matter? Don't
you trust Punch and Judy?

16:35.241 --> 16:37.971
Would you?

16:41.247 --> 16:43.340
What do you want me
to do with it?

16:43.416 --> 16:46.317
Put it on my tab.

16:55.361 --> 16:59.127
You missed a spot. Thank you.

17:02.335 --> 17:05.304
What's the matter with them?
Magnum must be back.

17:20.386 --> 17:22.319
Hi.

17:22.387 --> 17:24.948
You guys are worse
than the dogs.

17:30.697 --> 17:36.329
Hi, Higgins. Look, when you're through with the
Audi... I can start on the Ferrari. How original.

17:36.402 --> 17:40.566
What'd you do to Higgins?
He's in a terrible mood.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.336
Nothing. I just pointed out
a couple of spots he'd missed.

17:43.409 --> 17:47.038
Nothing else to do? Well, it gets
pretty boring laying around all day.

17:47.113 --> 17:50.810
I mean, how much sun can you take?
What have you been up to? A case?

17:50.884 --> 17:54.445
The one you were working on last night?
No. A different one.

17:54.521 --> 17:59.686
Another one already? Your life must read
like one of Robin Masters's novels.

17:59.759 --> 18:02.353
Not really.

18:02.428 --> 18:06.558
Course, I have been known to give him an idea
or two, you know, whenever he gets stuck.

18:09.802 --> 18:12.862
I knew it. I bet
you were that espionage agent...

18:12.939 --> 18:15.373
he had in the one about the
missing pieces of jade. No.

18:15.441 --> 18:19.241
Tom, it had to be you. Mandy, I
don't even own a trench coat.

18:19.312 --> 18:22.975
You're making fun of me.
No, I'm not.

18:23.049 --> 18:26.780
Well, then, next time, can
I go with you? Where?

18:26.853 --> 18:30.482
Wherever you go on your case.
Mandy, I can't take you with me.

18:30.557 --> 18:34.323
Tom, I wouldn't be any trouble. I'd be invisible.
I mean, you wouldn't even know I was there.

18:34.394 --> 18:36.589
Believe me, I'd know.
No, you wouldn't.

18:36.663 --> 18:40.326
Look, Mandy,
maybe next time you're in.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.666
You know, it's really not that exciting.
Tom, you're being too modest.

18:44.737 --> 18:48.332
I bet it's very exciting.

18:48.408 --> 18:51.502
The phone's ringing.
I gotta answer the phone.

18:53.313 --> 18:56.339
Tom, do I disturb you
in some way?

18:56.416 --> 18:58.907
Disturb me? No. Why?

18:58.985 --> 19:01.351
Well, I don't know.
You just seem sort of nervous.

19:01.421 --> 19:06.518
Nervous? Oh, look, Mandy, why don't you
go in there and put some clothes on,

19:06.593 --> 19:10.222
and then we can run into Waikiki
and we'll have a nice lunch, okay?

19:10.296 --> 19:14.926
Can we go to one of your local hangouts so I
can meet those crazy characters you deal with?

19:15.001 --> 19:18.129
- Mandy, we'll have a nice lunch, okay?
- Okay.

19:25.111 --> 19:27.238
- Hello?
- Magnum?

19:28.615 --> 19:31.106
It's Hooker. How
are things going out there?

19:31.184 --> 19:35.382
Oh, fine. I was just running a few
security checks. How about your end?

19:35.455 --> 19:39.585
Oh, well, there's nothing to worry about
here. That beach boy on the sailboat...

19:39.659 --> 19:42.287
turns out to be a stringer
for Kingtown Publications...

19:42.362 --> 19:48.301
you know, takes photos for one of those supermarket sensations,
tells you what Cher had for breakfast, that sort of thing.

19:48.368 --> 19:52.327
He's probably trying to cop a couple of shots
of Farrah Fawcett sunbathing in the buff.

19:52.405 --> 19:54.396
I don't buy that.
There's gotta be more.

19:54.474 --> 19:58.934
Hey, look. That estate you're on there
is notorious for its weekend guests.

19:59.012 --> 20:02.778
- I think it all fits.
- Yeah. Any other weekend but this one.

20:02.849 --> 20:06.341
But what about this guy's background?
I mean, how long's he been in the Islands?

20:06.419 --> 20:09.946
- Where's he come from?
- Look, Magnum. It's a dead end.

20:10.023 --> 20:13.083
Drop it. Get on to the next hole.
Wait a minute, Hooker.

20:13.159 --> 20:16.617
Just wait a minute.
What kind of check is that?

20:16.696 --> 20:19.597
I give you a possible lead
that should demand a triple-star rundown,

20:19.666 --> 20:22.157
and you guys come back
with a surface analysis?

20:22.235 --> 20:25.864
- We're not checking this guy's
credit rating. - Look, Magnum.

20:25.938 --> 20:28.429
We checked the guy out.
We came up with nothing.

20:28.508 --> 20:33.946
That's all you need to know.
The guy is Mr. Clean.

21:08.948 --> 21:11.746
When Mandy and I got back from lunch,

21:11.818 --> 21:15.015
Rick had an address
on the beach boy, Jerry Sampson.

21:15.088 --> 21:19.184
I don't know why I was convinced there had to be
more to him than Hooker and Dobey had turned up.

21:19.258 --> 21:21.658
It was just something I felt.

21:25.431 --> 21:28.867
Come on.
Take some weight, will ya?

21:28.935 --> 21:32.302
Just push, will ya? I am pushin'.
It's pushin' back.

21:32.372 --> 21:35.034
Wait a minute.
We have to turn... Aah.

21:48.955 --> 21:52.083
Hey, will you take it easy? I told
Sarducci it'd come back like it left.

21:52.158 --> 21:57.221
Sarducci, don't you think we should turn the
trunk on end so we can get it through the door?

22:06.105 --> 22:09.006
Ohh, will you come on?

22:12.044 --> 22:14.877
I got it.

22:14.947 --> 22:17.541
Ciao.

22:20.319 --> 22:24.483
"" Ciao"?
That's what Sarducci always says.

22:24.557 --> 22:26.684
Ohh.

22:28.127 --> 22:31.961
I told you to take it easy.

22:32.031 --> 22:34.966
Okay. What are we lookin' for?
I don't know.

22:35.034 --> 22:39.164
What do you mean, you don't know? I don't
know yet. I'll know when I find it.

23:20.346 --> 23:23.713
Magnum?
Just a minute. I think I found something.

23:23.783 --> 23:26.718
Uh, so did I.

23:27.854 --> 23:31.214
What are you two doing in here? What are we
doin' in here? What are you doin' in here?

23:31.224 --> 23:34.990
What does it look like we're doing in here? We have
this place staked out. I think you've just blown it.

23:35.061 --> 23:38.224
I thought you said it was a dead end.
I told you what you needed to know.

23:38.297 --> 23:41.733
Oh, can that "" need to know" bull.
just can it. just a minute.

23:41.801 --> 23:46.670
You want everybody out there to know? Look,
if I'm in on this case, I'm in on all levels.

23:46.739 --> 23:49.940
Now, you gonna fill me in, Hooker, or do
I have a little talk with the brigadier?

23:53.813 --> 23:57.874
Folkes is in charge of British land-based forces
in Northern Ireland for the past two years.

23:57.950 --> 24:01.886
- He's attached to Special Air Services.
- Those guys are S.A.S.?

24:01.954 --> 24:04.081
Yeah. I should've realized,
the way they operated.

24:04.156 --> 24:06.556
Four-man teams.
No identifying insignia.

24:06.626 --> 24:09.891
Anyway, Folkes and his men
have been remarkably successful...

24:09.962 --> 24:12.760
in knocking down I.R.A. factions
operating out of Ulster.

24:12.832 --> 24:16.734
The latest unit they took apart was one headed
by two guys named Farnsworth and Barstow.

24:16.802 --> 24:19.430
Now, Farnsworth and Barstow
come up for sentencing tomorrow.

24:19.505 --> 24:23.601
Their mates in the I.R.A. have said that Farnsworth
and Barstow go down, the I.R.A. will retaliate.

24:23.676 --> 24:26.474
By killing Folkes. Now, why didn't
you tell me that this morning?

24:26.546 --> 24:30.573
As I told you before, you had no need
to know. No need to know. Terrific.

24:30.650 --> 24:34.746
Hooker, what did you really dig up
on Sampson?

24:36.222 --> 24:40.886
- Tell him. - Came out here from the
States about a month ago. Irish descent.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.396
During a stint in college, he was
associated with a couple of radical groups.

24:44.463 --> 24:48.399
They were pro-I.R.A., but he was never
involved with any active, known agitators.

24:48.467 --> 24:52.904
A lot of kids suddenly discover their roots
and start waving banners and yelling slogans.

24:52.972 --> 24:55.770
This guy is doing a lot more
than just waving banners.

24:55.841 --> 24:59.174
Look, Magnum. For the moment, you're
technically a U.S. government agent.

24:59.245 --> 25:01.179
You can't go around
breaking and entering like that.

25:01.247 --> 25:06.378
This guy can bring us up on charges. Only kind of
charges he's interested in is this. Plastique.

25:06.452 --> 25:10.218
Explosives? Bye.

25:10.289 --> 25:15.317
Yeah. That does change things, doesn't it?
just a bit.

25:16.562 --> 25:20.589
Okay. We'll take it from here. Dobey,
get us some backup, get on the horn,

25:20.666 --> 25:23.430
find Sampson, pick him up.

25:23.502 --> 25:26.494
That's more like it.

25:26.572 --> 25:31.976
Look, Hooker, no more
of this "" need to know" crap, okay?

25:32.044 --> 25:34.035
Okay.

25:57.136 --> 26:02.301
T.C. was right. My attire drew some
questioning glances, especially from Higgins.

26:02.375 --> 26:06.539
But after the initial couple of minutes,
I got used to it.

26:06.612 --> 26:10.878
I just hadn't been able
to reach for the salt all evening.

26:12.885 --> 26:15.149
I had the feeling we were all
under scrutiny.

26:15.221 --> 26:20.090
The brigadier had the kind of probing eyes that
could bore through to the back of your skull.

26:20.159 --> 26:22.719
It could be most unnerving.

26:22.795 --> 26:25.696
I bet you've seen quite a lot
of action in your career.

26:25.765 --> 26:28.233
Yes. I suppose I have.

26:28.300 --> 26:32.066
I was in Africa,
France, Cyprus, and now Belfast.

26:32.138 --> 26:35.232
Belfast? I'll bet you were glad
to get out of there.

26:35.307 --> 26:39.744
Frankly, yes. Although Northern Ireland's
a very beautiful place.

26:39.812 --> 26:44.146
I don't suppose either of you have ever
been there, have you? No. No, I haven't.

26:44.216 --> 26:49.518
I have, Brigadier. Really?
Where'd you go? Belfast?

26:49.588 --> 26:52.921
Yes. I didn't really get a chance to
see it. It was just on an overnight.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.259
- How about you, Magnum?
- Uh, no, sir. Never have been.

26:58.330 --> 27:02.699
Yes, well, it's not exactly a tourist spot,
is it? It can be a bit tense nowadays.

27:02.768 --> 27:06.295
- Explosive might be a better term for it, sir.
- Mm.

27:06.372 --> 27:12.208
You know, I don't really understand why you're fighting there. Why
don't the English just let the Irish have Northern Ireland back?

27:12.278 --> 27:14.678
Well, we're not fighting there,
my dear.

27:14.747 --> 27:19.047
The army is merely an extension of the police
force. We're trying to prevent violence.

27:19.118 --> 27:24.556
You see, the majority of the people in Northern Ireland
don't want to be separated from the United Kingdom.

27:24.623 --> 27:28.616
The I.R.A. is trying to bomb them
into changing their minds.

27:28.694 --> 27:31.754
I personally don't think
that's the way to do it.

27:32.832 --> 27:37.792
- What brings you out here, Brigadier? - Magnum,
the brigadier is a guest of Robin Masters.

27:37.870 --> 27:41.067
I do believe it's a prerogative
to vacation where he pleases.

27:41.140 --> 27:45.076
It's quite all right, Higgins.
Actually, I came out for the sunshine.

27:45.144 --> 27:47.169
The army suggested I might
take a few days off...

27:47.246 --> 27:52.115
because some terrorists that my unit
had captured are coming up for trial.

27:52.184 --> 27:56.314
The authorities thought that some of their
friends might have a try at killing me.

27:56.388 --> 28:00.256
- How do you sleep at night?
- Sometimes not too well,

28:00.326 --> 28:02.794
but I'm hoping
it'll be rather different here.

28:02.862 --> 28:06.059
After all, Hawaii's
a long way from Northern Ireland.

28:06.132 --> 28:10.398
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll hit the hay.

28:10.469 --> 28:14.235
I'm working on an 11 hour jet lag. I'll
see you all tomorrow. Good night, sir.

28:16.408 --> 28:20.435
Will there be anything else, ladies?
Oh, no, thanks.

28:20.513 --> 28:24.745
I'm going to slip on my suit and grab
a quick dip. Anybody care to join me?

28:24.817 --> 28:27.342
- Sure. I'll go.
- I'll join you in a minute.

28:31.690 --> 28:34.853
Higgins, how well
do you know the brigadier?

28:34.927 --> 28:39.489
I served as his sergeant major
in '51 in Hong Kong. Why?

28:39.565 --> 28:43.831
Did you know about the possibility of an
attempt on his life before this evening?

28:43.903 --> 28:49.603
Uh, no. As a matter of fact, I didn't.
But there was no need for me to know.

28:49.675 --> 28:55.079
Oh, come on, now. Not you too. No need to know you
have a guest on the estate who's an assassin's target?

28:55.147 --> 28:57.377
Oh, come now, Magnum.
I'm well aware of the brigadier's position,

28:57.449 --> 29:00.009
that his life
is always in imminent danger.

29:00.085 --> 29:04.215
Security's been paramount since his arrival
with us... as you've witnessed yourself.

29:04.290 --> 29:07.953
Believe me, no one is going to make an attempt on
the brigadier's life while he's in my bailiwick.

29:08.027 --> 29:12.191
No. I guess one wouldn't dare,
would one?

29:26.879 --> 29:29.347
It's good for my cold.

30:16.662 --> 30:19.358
Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

30:19.431 --> 30:23.891
That's all right. Decide
to take in a little air, Brigadier?

30:23.969 --> 30:29.032
No. As a matter of fact, I wanted to
have a few quiet words with you in private.

30:32.478 --> 30:35.470
Tell me, Magnum. Who is it
you're working for now?

30:35.547 --> 30:38.675
Is it the N.I.A. still,
or some other outfit?

30:38.751 --> 30:41.879
Now, what makes you think
I'm working for anybody?

30:41.954 --> 30:45.014
Well, if I was in their shoes, and an ex-agent
like you happened to be in the neighborhood,

30:45.090 --> 30:47.024
I'd snap you up immediately.

30:47.092 --> 30:50.994
Why would they want anybody like me?
Aren't we all on the same side, Brigadier?

30:51.063 --> 30:53.896
Directly, yes. But you
know the score, Magnum.

30:53.966 --> 30:57.993
The left hand doesn't know what the right hand's
doing. It's all a question of need to know, isn't it?

30:58.070 --> 31:00.095
Yes, that's right.

31:00.172 --> 31:02.970
Maybe that's what's wrong
with our firms.

31:03.042 --> 31:06.102
Maybe if we communicated a little better,
there'd be a little less killing.

31:06.178 --> 31:09.773
It's a nice idea, but I doubt it.

31:09.848 --> 31:14.547
It's practically impossible
to eliminate interagency rivalries.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.747
It would be like
taking the competition...

31:16.822 --> 31:21.020
out of the Super Bowl
or the World Series, wouldn't it?

31:21.093 --> 31:24.256
Well, that certainly makes it
sound like a nice little game.

31:25.564 --> 31:30.968
Yes, I know what you mean, Magnum. It's a serious
business. People lose their lives, of course.

31:33.038 --> 31:38.738
That's the way it is. And if it's a game,
it's a game that I want to win,

31:38.811 --> 31:41.609
beat the other fellow.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.514
Course, if you can change the world,
I'd be happy to go along with you.

31:45.584 --> 31:50.578
In the meantime, I gotta do my job,
haven't I? And you've gotta do yours.

31:50.656 --> 31:55.059
Which brings
me back to my original point.

31:55.127 --> 31:57.527
Who are you working for?

31:59.565 --> 32:03.899
Well, Brigadier, I don't believe
you have a need to know.

32:05.471 --> 32:08.065
Good night, sir.

32:22.488 --> 32:24.786
It's getting chilly.
I'm calling it a night.

32:24.857 --> 32:29.351
Well, I'm gonna stay and do a couple
more laps to work off that meal.

32:29.428 --> 32:31.953
Good-bye.

33:07.232 --> 33:11.794
How's the water?
Oh! You gave me goose bumps.

33:11.870 --> 33:14.703
Yeah, well, I affect
some women that way. Oh.

33:14.773 --> 33:19.369
Well, since you can't join me,
I guess I'll have to join you.

33:21.113 --> 33:24.810
- Hey! Mandy, get out of there.
Get out of there. - What?

33:24.883 --> 33:29.286
Just get out of there.

33:29.354 --> 33:31.822
Don't shoot! It's Magnum!

33:38.163 --> 33:42.463
Oh, no.!

33:42.534 --> 33:46.163
Magnum?

34:00.486 --> 34:05.389
No. Send him tomorrow.
Four of 'em, right?

34:05.457 --> 34:11.157
No. Get the cleanup out here tonight. We'll have
the divers tomorrow as soon as possible. Right.

34:11.230 --> 34:14.563
How is she?
Oh, well, she finally fell asleep.

34:14.632 --> 34:18.569
- Suzie's gonna stay with her in case she wakes
up. - The hot toddy helped calm her nerves.

34:18.637 --> 34:21.902
I think she'll sleep
through the night.

34:21.974 --> 34:25.170
Very lucky, you know. If the tide had
been in, you'd never have seen him.

34:25.244 --> 34:29.340
You know, I don't believe any of this.
Talk about a giant waste of energy.

34:29.414 --> 34:31.938
What are you talking
about, Magnum?

34:32.016 --> 34:35.714
I am talk... I am talking
about all this cloak-and-dagger stuff.

34:35.786 --> 34:39.279
I'm talking about
nobody talking to anybody.

34:39.358 --> 34:42.327
Magnum, I think you can appreciate
that in a matter like this,

34:42.393 --> 34:45.295
you can't go around
telling everybody everything.

34:45.364 --> 34:48.424
No. You just tell 'em
what they need to know.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.435
Otherwise, people might find out
what really is going on here.

34:51.503 --> 34:55.132
We wouldn't have this kind of a mess.
But instead, we got a dead man...

34:55.206 --> 34:58.643
who can't tell us why he's here,
who sent him, are there others...

34:58.710 --> 35:01.679
Look, Magnum, we know
why he was here.

35:01.747 --> 35:04.307
We know who sent him.
We think we know.

35:04.383 --> 35:08.479
And there's a big difference in my book. I'm
not 100% sure this guy's part of the I.R.A.

35:08.554 --> 35:11.990
Magnum, can we have this
discussion later? Why?

35:13.392 --> 35:15.860
What is with you guys?
What is with you?

35:15.928 --> 35:20.194
This man is responsible for this place,
and he's got a dead man on his hands.

35:20.265 --> 35:23.598
He has every right to know every
damn thing that's going on here.

35:23.669 --> 35:28.834
- Higgins, you stay if you want.
- I have to look in on the brigadier.

35:30.342 --> 35:34.779
Magnum,
I'm glad you're all right.

35:42.387 --> 35:47.222
Look, Magnum, the brigadier is leaving in the
morning. I think your end of this is all wrapped up.

35:47.292 --> 35:50.159
Guys, doesn't it even strike you
as a little bit funny...

35:50.229 --> 35:53.426
that this guy didn't have a weapon,
and we found explosives at his place?

35:53.498 --> 35:56.399
If there is anything out there,
the divers will find it in the morning.

35:56.468 --> 35:58.663
As far as you're concerned,
this case is closed.

35:58.737 --> 36:01.604
I've got my man.
I've got as much evidence as I need.

36:01.673 --> 36:05.700
Just like that. That's it. Just
sweep the rest under the rug, huh?

36:07.379 --> 36:10.473
Magnum, just submit your bill, huh?

36:10.549 --> 36:15.384
It's only 11:30. I think you've only been
working for your Uncle Sam one full day now.

36:15.454 --> 36:18.582
He really appreciates your help.
Dobey.

36:37.843 --> 36:40.835
I didn't sleep at all.
Hooker could've been right.

36:40.912 --> 36:45.076
Sampson could've dropped his weapon when
he got hit, but there was something else,

36:45.150 --> 36:47.448
something Hooker said.

36:47.519 --> 36:50.920
The trial of Farnsworth
and Barstow was today.

36:50.989 --> 36:54.789
A hit on the brigadier last night
would've been a day early.

36:55.861 --> 36:59.456
What's with the Sea Hunt outfit?
Oh.

36:59.531 --> 37:04.525
Uh, something about last night. I just...
It's just bothering me, that's all.

37:04.603 --> 37:08.937
Anyway, look, I know you'd rather not talk
about it. No. No. I'm all right. Really.

37:10.275 --> 37:13.108
You sure you're okay?
Yeah. I'm sure.

37:14.246 --> 37:18.307
Tom, I never got a chance to talk to you
about what happened last night.

37:18.383 --> 37:21.944
There's nothing to talk about. You're
all right. That's enough. I know,

37:22.020 --> 37:27.822
but I was never so scared
in my whole life.

37:29.294 --> 37:34.197
Those men were horrible.
They were just... just horrible.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.398
It's all right.

37:39.771 --> 37:42.137
It's okay.

38:02.861 --> 38:06.353
Don't go too far. This
won't take long. Well,

38:06.431 --> 38:09.161
I'm going back up
to the main house.

38:09.234 --> 38:13.398
Higgins is letting us move back in today.
It's just my luck.

38:41.733 --> 38:45.362
If Jerry Sampson had been
on his way to kill the brigadier,

38:45.437 --> 38:49.771
a gun or a bomb or something should've
been at the bottom of the tidal pool.

38:49.841 --> 38:52.605
But after covering every foot
of it, I found nothing.

39:04.656 --> 39:08.387
And bring the rest
of it now, please.

39:36.221 --> 39:39.850
And how was your morning swim?
Fine.

39:39.925 --> 39:43.053
The car doesn't look too shabby.
Thank you.

39:48.300 --> 39:53.135
I, uh, should be back within the hour;
Then I can settle you into the main house.

39:58.210 --> 40:01.873
Get cleared up quickly, then come
out to the airport. Yes, sir.

40:06.985 --> 40:09.715
Good-bye. Good-bye. Have
a nice trip, Brigadier.

40:09.788 --> 40:12.052
Thank you.

40:41.186 --> 40:44.087
Did you find anything?
No. Nothing.

40:44.155 --> 40:47.647
You see? Nothing happened to the
brigadier while he was on the grounds.

40:51.162 --> 40:53.494
The Audi. What?

40:53.565 --> 40:55.829
I'll bet Jerry Sampson
didn't own one. So?

40:55.901 --> 41:00.395
He had a repair manual for one and a sales
receipt for an auto part. I gotta catch Higgins.

41:00.472 --> 41:04.169
Thomas. Around here now.
Come on.

41:06.344 --> 41:08.437
Mandy.

41:22.127 --> 41:26.928
You were it all along. jerry was just the
delivery boy. You were gonna make the hit.

41:26.998 --> 41:28.966
Mandy. Tom, don't.

41:29.034 --> 41:31.093
I'll use this if you force it.

41:31.169 --> 41:34.070
- No. You couldn't.
- You're not that stupid.

41:34.139 --> 41:38.405
After last night's demonstration?
They're animals. They're murderers.

41:38.476 --> 41:42.139
Tell me about it, when four men get blown to hell,
including an innocent bystander named Higgins.

41:42.213 --> 41:46.149
You won't understand.
You don't see their brutality,

41:46.217 --> 41:48.777
their treatment of people
in prison without trial.

41:48.853 --> 41:53.517
Contempt for a whole race of people,
not just now, but for the past 300 years.

41:53.592 --> 41:56.060
When's it all gonna stop,
the killing and the violence?

41:56.127 --> 42:00.291
- When all of Ireland is united. When we're
a nation once again. - And then what?

42:00.365 --> 42:03.960
You're just gonna push all this behind you
and forget? The end justifies the means?

42:04.035 --> 42:06.128
Mandy, there's better ways.
Thomas, shut up!

42:06.204 --> 42:08.172
No!

42:20.819 --> 42:26.121
She wasn't gonna shoot! You're a
bloody fool if you believe that, mate.

42:59.791 --> 43:03.318
My only chance was if Higgins stuck
to his usual route to the airport,

43:03.395 --> 43:09.334
but if he'd contracted the security fever, he might
try something fancy and take an alternate route.

43:09.401 --> 43:12.837
And then I had no way of reaching him
in time... if there was any left.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.570
- Magnum, you idiot!
- A bomb!

44:46.131 --> 44:50.067
Get the hell outta there.
There's a bomb. Bomb?

45:00.378 --> 45:02.812
A bomb? Yes.

45:04.382 --> 45:07.283
Well, when's it going to blow?

45:07.352 --> 45:10.048
Now.

45:15.860 --> 45:18.829
I thought we disposed
of our man last night, Magnum.

45:18.897 --> 45:21.559
I suppose we missed somebody.

45:21.633 --> 45:26.764
It was the girl, Brigadier.
And your men didn't miss her.

45:37.849 --> 45:40.079
Mmm. Thomas, I can't wait
till you taste this.

45:40.151 --> 45:43.018
I haven't tasted sauce like this
since Sarducci made it.

45:45.290 --> 45:47.724
? Roma?

45:56.901 --> 46:00.769
Taste this. Sinatra's
even go nuts for it.

46:07.712 --> 46:09.839
You didn't kill her, Thomas.

46:11.783 --> 46:14.479
I didn't save her either. Look.
She did what she had to do,

46:14.552 --> 46:16.816
and the brigadier and his boys
did what they had to do.

46:16.888 --> 46:20.654
Damn, Tom. It wasn't so different
for us at one time, or did you forget?

46:20.725 --> 46:24.422
Come on. Drink your wine.
Life goes on.

46:27.732 --> 46:32.431
Thanks, buddy.

46:38.943 --> 46:41.878
Shut up, you mangy pot hounds!

46:43.815 --> 46:47.046
Thomas, you gonna have to do somethin' about them dogs.
You gonna have to do somethin' about those dogs.

46:47.118 --> 46:50.747
T.C., don't talk to me about it.
Talk to Higgins.

46:52.423 --> 46:55.187
All right. Sure. I'll talk to Higgins.
I'm not afraid to talk to Higgins.

46:55.260 --> 46:58.957
- Hey, you wanna join us for some of
Rick's pasta? - You got my jacket?

46:59.030 --> 47:02.227
- Yeah. Stay. We've got a lot.
- Man, I don't want no pasta.

47:02.300 --> 47:05.394
- I'm gonna remember that.
- Did something happen to my jacket?

47:07.071 --> 47:09.471
What makes you think
something happened to your jacket?

47:09.540 --> 47:12.873
Because you didn't say something
didn't happen to it. T.C.,

47:12.944 --> 47:15.071
it is in the closet.

47:15.146 --> 47:17.114
- I'm gonna go for a swim.
- Oh, no, you're not.

47:17.181 --> 47:20.378
You wait right there
until I check my jacket out.

47:20.451 --> 47:23.648
I got this date with
this fine flight attendant comin' in here,

47:23.721 --> 47:26.519
and I wanna look good,
'cause I look good in this jacket.

47:26.591 --> 47:30.789
Well? Hey, it's okay.

47:30.862 --> 47:35.765
Hey, man. I'm sorry. Any time you wanna
use this jacket, just feel free to ask me.

47:35.833 --> 47:39.769
Forget it. I just need it tonight,
'cause I got this ebony wahine,

47:39.837 --> 47:44.069
natural, good-lookin' chick, and I really
wanna look good, 'cause I look good in this.

47:44.142 --> 47:47.134
Magnum.! Magnum.!
