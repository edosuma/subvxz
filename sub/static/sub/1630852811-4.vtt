WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.280
Can I ask what you're doing here?

00:03.280 --> 00:04.720
I'm the doctor who delivered
your nephew.

00:04.720 --> 00:05.880
That's why I'm asking if it's
appropriate

00:05.880 --> 00:06.960
for you to be here with my sister.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.240
The mum's lodged a complaint.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.160
Is that your statement? I've not
even started mine yet.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.360
I've only managed seven words and
a coffee stain.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.800
Write that you discussed with me
over the phone

00:14.800 --> 00:16.840
and that I advised you
to send her home.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.600
I know you hoped I'd marry Helen,

00:18.600 --> 00:20.960
Mum, you've mentioned it every 40
minutes for the last five years.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.240
Would your friend like a chocolate?
Boyfriend, actually.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.840
I'm very happy, and we love each
other, and we're gay.

00:25.840 --> 00:26.960
Both of you?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.640
Will you marry me?  Of course I will.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.480
TRACY:  Bye! Don't forget her lunch!

00:40.480 --> 00:41.880
MAN:  Yeah, I know, darling.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.000
ALARM BEEPS

00:52.680 --> 00:56.440
# Cradle me, I'll cradle you

00:56.440 --> 00:58.400
ALARM BEEPS

00:58.400 --> 01:00.400
# I'll win your heart
with a woop-a-woo

01:00.400 --> 01:04.440
# Pulling shapes just for your eyes

01:05.720 --> 01:09.240
# So with toothpaste kisses

01:09.240 --> 01:11.680
# And lines

01:11.680 --> 01:14.000
# I'll be yours and you'll be

01:14.000 --> 01:17.480
# Lay with me, I'll lay with you

01:17.480 --> 01:22.360
# We'll do the things that lovers do

01:22.360 --> 01:26.200
# Put the stars in our eyes

01:26.200 --> 01:31.040
# And with heart-shaped bruises

01:31.040 --> 01:35.440
# And late night kisses, divine... #

01:42.640 --> 01:45.800
ENGINE FAILS TO START Come on.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.160
KNOCK ON WINDOW

01:56.160 --> 01:57.440
Dozy twat!

01:59.560 --> 02:01.320
Sorry. ENGINE CUTS OUT

02:02.440 --> 02:05.280
ENGINE FAILS TO START
HORNS BEEP

02:05.280 --> 02:06.480
All right!

02:17.320 --> 02:19.720
So, doing anything fun tonight?

02:20.760 --> 02:24.640
Yes, actually. I thought I'd, erm,
go home three hours late,

02:24.640 --> 02:27.240
get shouted at
and fall asleep on the toilet.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.840
There should be some kind of
legal form

02:29.840 --> 02:31.880
that people have to sign before
they date doctors.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.200
What, like sex offenders do?
Yeah, exactly.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.880
Your girlfriend must be used to the
late nights by now, though, right?

02:42.880 --> 02:44.240
Fiance, actually.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.520
Oh, congratulations!

02:45.520 --> 02:48.240
And it's F-I-N-A-N-C-E.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.840
"Finance"?

02:52.840 --> 02:56.120
No, I meant, erm, as in...one E.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.480
The male version.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.800
I'm gay.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.160
Oh, shit. Oh, sorr...

03:03.160 --> 03:04.840
Erm, I didn't...  It's fine.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.320
My alpha-male demeanour clearly
threw you off the scent.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.680
So, who proposed, then?

03:10.680 --> 03:12.600
We both sort of did, actually.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.160
In a graveyard. Obviously.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.560
We're actually exchanging
the rings tonight.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.160
That's lovely.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.800
Do you have a special someone
you apologise to?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.480
Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.920
I'm actually in a polyamorous

03:27.920 --> 03:29.880
three-way relationship right
now, so it's me,

03:29.880 --> 03:32.720
gynaecology textbooks and
a bucket of cheap chow mein.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.720
Right. How does the sex work
with the three of you?

03:34.720 --> 03:37.360
Hm! Sounds intriguing!

03:37.360 --> 03:40.240
Right, this complaint, then.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.520
I've just sent off my statement,

03:43.520 --> 03:45.960
and when you do yours,
you're obviously going to say

03:45.960 --> 03:48.720
what happened
on the night in question.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.760
Yeah, of course.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.720
That you told us
to send the patient home.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.560
Yeah, but that was
before it was a complaint.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.440
Now I think we need to be

03:58.440 --> 04:01.080
a little more scrupulous
with the facts.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.720
Fuck! He's withdrawing
what he said. The bastard!

04:04.720 --> 04:07.320
He's withdrawing it
like a condomless cock

04:07.320 --> 04:08.960
and spraying it in our faces.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.960
You sent her home without asking me.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.960
That's the truth,
and I strongly suggest

04:12.960 --> 04:15.120
that that's what you write
in your statements.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.120
Fudging the facts
can only make things

04:17.120 --> 04:18.560
worse in the long run.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.880
Of course, Mr Lockhart.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.720
I've always wondered what the
underneath of a bus looks like.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.160
Well, off you go.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.160
Shut the door.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.440
I thought you said
this wasn't a disaster.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.520
"This isn't a GMC thing.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.040
"We're not going to
get struck off."

04:38.040 --> 04:39.600
It's precisely a disaster.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.760
But can't we just write
the truth on our forms

04:41.760 --> 04:43.040
and sweat it out?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.560
Well, I would do that, obviously,

04:44.560 --> 04:46.720
but I've already submitted
my statement.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.120
And you wrote...?

04:48.120 --> 04:49.640
That he told us
to send the patient home!

04:49.640 --> 04:51.360
I mean, what was I supposed
to say to him?

04:51.360 --> 04:53.560
"That's so kind to offer,
but, no, thanks."

04:57.240 --> 05:00.040
Listen, it's fine. I'll handle it.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.520
How?
I've got something. It's fine.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.800
You'd better.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.680
Got nothing. It's very un-fine.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.040
Yes, I'm still really enjoying it.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.480
Nine babies now.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.320
Yeah, they went really well.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.440
Yeah, their parents
all named them Shruti, so...

05:18.440 --> 05:20.600
No, Mum, that was a joke. I was...

05:20.600 --> 05:22.920
I was obviously joking.
They don't really do that.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.080
No, I can't next week.
That's not how the rota works.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.680
Yeah, of course I'm eating.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.160
Oh, er, that's my bleep going off.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.720
Yeah, I'd better get that.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.360
Uh-huh. Will do.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.280
SHE SPEAKS HINDI

05:41.840 --> 05:43.760
OK.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.880
Yeah. Love to Dad.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.240
OK, bye. Bye.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.560
TOILET FLUSHES

06:17.560 --> 06:18.640
All right?

06:20.480 --> 06:23.200
Here. Use this.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.400
That stuff'll sand your face off.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.520
Thank you.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.200
Oh, thank God you're here.  Go on.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.400
I have been totally abandoned.
I'm on my own here today.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.840
Tracy and Ria have been sent off

07:03.840 --> 07:07.200
on some stupid course, and we've got
triplets to deliver.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.960
Triplets?  Exactly. Three times the
chance something'll go wrong.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.600
Triplets happen
one in every 6,500 pregnancies.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.480
Not often on a labour ward
do you get the chance

07:14.480 --> 07:16.520
to do something
you've never done before.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.560
Today of all days!

07:17.560 --> 07:20.360
What are the odds?  Go on, what are
the odds? Of triplets?

07:20.360 --> 07:21.480
Oh, erm, one in 4,000?

07:21.480 --> 07:24.760
Actually, that's wrong.
Once you take IVF into account.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.800
All right, Stephen Dorking.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.880
Erm, who's the consultant on today?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.400
Erm, I think it's Ms Houghton.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.760
I saw her in the toilet.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.560
Can I have a quick word?

07:35.280 --> 07:38.800
Yeah.  No midwives, no ward clerk,
and now the doctors are leaving.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.240
OK, so, this statement thing,
right? It's easy.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.080
All you should do is just,
like, send in a new one.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.600
Yeah? Like, just say
you made a typo or something.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.280
Right. One of those typos where

07:47.280 --> 07:49.560
I accidentally falsified
my whole story.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.800
Well, you have to do something.
It's my career, too.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.240
Don't suppose there's anybody
fucking working here today,

07:54.240 --> 07:56.040
is there?  Sorry, Ms Houghton.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.040
We were just, er...  All right, you.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.720
I hope those shoes
have got steel toecaps.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.680
We're going to kick today
a whole new arsehole.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.360
OK...  Are you going to do something

08:04.360 --> 08:06.200
or just stand there like
a bottle of fucking mayonnaise?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.600
Why don't you get
a round of coffees in?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.800
Tell you what,
get yourself one, too.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.880
Sorry, darling. The bus broke down.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.840
No problem, just grab
a name badge and find a seat.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.920
So, as I was saying, geriatrics
should now be referred to as...

08:53.920 --> 08:56.080
.."care of the older person".

08:56.080 --> 08:58.920
"Care of the older person"?
They make it sound like a spa.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.760
I don't know why they don't
just go the whole hog,

09:00.760 --> 09:02.160
call it
"care of the inevitable".

09:02.160 --> 09:04.400
I'm sure it used to be called that
three directives ago.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.680
THEY LAUGH

09:05.680 --> 09:08.000
Anything I can help you with,
ladies?

09:09.200 --> 09:13.560
Oh, we were just saying that
it's, erm, it's great that, er,

09:13.560 --> 09:16.080
older patients will no longer
be crippled

09:16.080 --> 09:18.680
by old-fashioned language.  We...

09:18.680 --> 09:20.920
We don't say "crippled".

09:22.720 --> 09:24.200
Apologies.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.920
UNDER BREATH:  You twat.

09:25.920 --> 09:30.200
Patients should now be
referred to as..."clients".

09:30.200 --> 09:32.000
That's because the word "patient"

09:32.000 --> 09:34.440
actually stems from the Latin
"patiens", which....

09:34.440 --> 09:36.520
If they're clients,
then what are we?

09:36.520 --> 09:40.120
Prostitutes?  Well, at least
if I was a prostitute,

09:40.120 --> 09:42.080
I wouldn't have to put up
with that prick.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.320
I wouldn't bet on it.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.320
THEY LAUGH

09:45.320 --> 09:48.480
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT I'm just equipping you with

09:48.480 --> 09:50.280
the right language
to do your jobs properly.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.960
I'm sure my patients
will be thrilled.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.760
Clients.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.440
BOTH: Clients!

10:06.360 --> 10:08.040
Did you go to fucking Brazil
for those?

10:08.040 --> 10:12.000
Sorry, there was, erm, only one
person working at the coffee shop.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.120
"There was a lah-lah-lah-lah-lah."

10:16.240 --> 10:18.160
Keeping the change, or what?

10:21.360 --> 10:24.680
Yeah.  Ms Houghton, I've been
thinking a lot about triplets.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.360
No-one wants to hear
about your wank bank.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.680
Very pithy.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.480
So, what I meant was, erm,

10:29.480 --> 10:31.800
with regard to
the forthcoming operative

10:31.800 --> 10:36.640
delivery of the triplets...  Oh!
Such verisimilitude, Dr Kay.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.040
I don't know what it means.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.080
I just felt the need to join in
with the fancy words.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.680
Erm...

10:42.680 --> 10:45.400
..about the, er, triplets, erm...

10:45.400 --> 10:49.840
..I wonder if you might allow me
to perhaps do the Caesarean.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.360
I've obviously done several sets
of twins, and, erm...

10:54.360 --> 10:56.040
..it would be an incredible boost

10:56.040 --> 10:58.440
to my professional development
to have the opportunity

10:58.440 --> 11:00.160
to, erm, to learn your technique.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.000
What the fuck do you think
the technique is?

11:04.960 --> 11:06.120
You pull the babies out

11:06.120 --> 11:09.360
till there aren't any more
fucking babies to pull out.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.160
Right, shall we go and meet
the parents?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.800
Sorry, "encounter the progenitors".

11:18.000 --> 11:20.240
I'd say this is going very well.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.800
Hi! I'm Adam,

11:27.800 --> 11:31.040
one of the doctors, and this
is Ms Houghton, the consultant.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.560
This is nice, isn't it?

11:32.560 --> 11:34.880
It's like having a town crier.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.120
My name's Vicky. You are...?

11:38.120 --> 11:40.840
I'm Jasmine, and this is Dave.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.600
Lovely. I hear you've got
a little something for me.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.720
Oh, erm, yeah,
three little somethings.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.040
Three Little Birds.
Do you remember that one?

11:51.440 --> 11:52.720
Come on, you know it.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.040
# Three little birds

11:54.040 --> 11:56.080
# Pitched by my doorstep

11:56.080 --> 11:58.000
# Singing sweet songs

11:58.000 --> 12:00.520
# Of melodies pure and true

12:00.520 --> 12:06.160
# Saying, this is a message
to you-ou-ou... #

12:06.160 --> 12:07.880
BOTH LAUGH AWKWARDLY

12:07.880 --> 12:10.000
# ..Singing don't worry

12:10.000 --> 12:11.680
# 'Bout a thing

12:11.680 --> 12:13.840
# Cos... #

12:13.840 --> 12:15.560
Come on, you're up, guys.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.960
BOTH:  # E...Every little thing

12:18.960 --> 12:21.040
# Is gonna be all right... #

12:21.040 --> 12:22.320
# Rise up this morning... #

12:27.840 --> 12:29.840
Yeah, I'm not going to lie,
we don't get triplets in here

12:29.840 --> 12:31.800
every day!  Thank goodness.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.080
Yeah, thank goodness.
Last thing we need's

12:35.080 --> 12:37.600
a world shortage of bootees
and bonnets!

12:37.600 --> 12:39.400
You're in safe hands.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.360
I mean, we've got three goes, so

12:42.360 --> 12:45.400
by the time the last one's out,
we'll be great at it, won't we?

12:45.400 --> 12:47.600
You got names sorted?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.320
Yeah. We reckon so.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.480
Milly, Billie and Lily.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.920
It's difficult finding
three names that rhyme.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.760
No comment.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.480
What time do you want
to get her round to theatre?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.280
Well, there's no time
like the present.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.440
Shall we see
if the theatre's ready?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.200
I think someone's toast's burning.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.480
Probably just electing a new Pope.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.720
Yeah, Pope Eggs Benedict XV!

13:13.720 --> 13:15.440
Pope Shepherd's Pius II.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.360
"Shepherd's Pius"!

13:18.840 --> 13:20.840
Did you hear that?  Yeah.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.680
TRACY:  Sorry, can we get back
to the triplets?

13:23.680 --> 13:25.560
What, Huey, Dewey and Louie?

13:25.560 --> 13:27.360
Bordering on child abuse.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.720
ADAM CHUCKLES

13:28.720 --> 13:30.760
Had one the other week called
Lasagne!

13:32.560 --> 13:34.120
Lasagne!

13:34.120 --> 13:35.480
Yeah, I'm sure the patients

13:35.480 --> 13:37.760
on the labour ward
apologised for not having

13:37.760 --> 13:39.320
your level of education, Dr Kay.

13:39.320 --> 13:43.120
Well, I didn't...  Shruti, you're
doing the triplets.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.200
You, why don't you get yourself
down to A&E,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.920
see if you can clear some
of the backlog?

13:47.920 --> 13:50.680
There's a bloody good
bloody old chap.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.520
Hi, Erika. How are you doing?

14:24.520 --> 14:27.840
Oh, you know, pomme ci, pomme ca.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.240
It's actually...

14:30.480 --> 14:32.920
Yeah.  Can I ask you a question
about mist?

14:32.920 --> 14:34.440
Erm, yes, I...guess.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.160
Well, he's got a lump
on the back of his head.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.440
Sorry, what...?

14:37.440 --> 14:39.320
Look, you can see
under his hat, look.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.880
He's got a lump right at the back.
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.200
I didn't realise you'd... Mist.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.000
What a nice name.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.600
What's wrong with calling
a baby Steve once in a while?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.880
Does it have, erm,
a special meaning?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.640
Oh, yeah, yeah, it does, actually.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.880
It's like a type of rain.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.680
Could you...have a look for me?

15:01.680 --> 15:04.080
Oh, that's not really my speciality.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.000
Best to ask the baby doctors
when they come round.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.960
Yeah, but they haven't been
round yet this morning,

15:08.960 --> 15:10.880
and I tried to get someone
to come over,

15:10.880 --> 15:13.840
but no-one's coming over,
so I'm getting...

15:16.200 --> 15:17.720
Have a quick look.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.320
It's just under here.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.360
Can you see?

15:24.280 --> 15:28.480
OK, erm, that's called
an occipital protuberance.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.520
Oh, my God!

15:31.040 --> 15:32.400
Will... Will he be OK?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
Yeah. It's normal.
You've got one here.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.680
Oh, did he catch it from me?

15:38.680 --> 15:41.160
What, is his brain
going to be, like...all right?

15:42.560 --> 15:45.840
Erm, honestly, it's nothing
at all to worry about.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.720
Sorry. Thank you, Dr Adam.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.680
You're just the best!

15:52.720 --> 15:54.320
All part of the job. HE CHUCKLES

15:57.080 --> 15:59.320
I hope you don't mind
me asking, sorry,

15:59.320 --> 16:01.800
but why have you made
a complaint about me?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.920
Oh, no, no, it's not about you.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.480
It's about the hospital.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.880
Right, it's just that it does put
quite a lot of pressure,

16:07.880 --> 16:09.720
you know, sort of stress on me.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.800
Oh. Erm...

16:13.240 --> 16:16.480
It's just my sister said we should
get something back after...

16:17.440 --> 16:18.920
..after what happened.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.800
Sure. OK.
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

16:25.000 --> 16:26.480
Don't judge me.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.520
Erika, sorry, I don't m-m-mean to

16:29.520 --> 16:32.480
speak out of turn.
Erm, I'm just wondering if...

16:34.440 --> 16:37.120
..maybe the reason that
you haven't been able to see

16:37.120 --> 16:39.960
a baby doctor this morning
is because they're avoiding you,

16:39.960 --> 16:41.600
in case, you know,

16:41.600 --> 16:43.200
you complain about them, too.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.240
But they wouldn't do anything to put
my baby in danger, though.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.720
Erm...

16:47.720 --> 16:50.320
Listen, if I was looking after him,

16:50.320 --> 16:53.320
it wouldn't affect my care one bit.
I just...

16:54.960 --> 16:56.760
I can't speak for everyone here.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.960
But ignore me, because I...

17:02.960 --> 17:05.360
Yeah, I shouldn't have
said anything.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.840
What do you think I should do?

17:08.040 --> 17:11.080
Erm, I think you're going
to figure it out.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.480
You know, mums know best.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.320
And stay strong, really, for Mist.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.880
HUBBUB

17:46.480 --> 17:48.760
We've been here for about an hour!

17:56.600 --> 17:57.960
Come on, then.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.600
Here we go. OK?

18:21.920 --> 18:23.880
Big pull.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.040
There you are.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.840
Are you sure
you don't want to do it?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.920
Yeah, you're kind to offer,
mate, but what I actually want

18:30.920 --> 18:32.320
is 20 Rothmans Superkings,

18:32.320 --> 18:34.480
and at the moment you're standing
in the way of them.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.080
Right, bang a finger
in there, then. That's it.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.680
OK, nearly there.  OK.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.320
Just a few more seconds. Yeah.

18:43.600 --> 18:47.280
OK. The good news is, I can't
see any cause of the bleeding.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.280
And what are you doing this evening?

18:49.280 --> 18:50.480
Funny you should ask.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.920
I'm going to this restaurant
that we really love.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.760
Oh, OK, great. Er, can you call
the New York office

18:55.760 --> 18:57.680
when they open and get someone
to overnight the documents?

18:57.680 --> 19:01.320
Uh-huh. Ooh, yeah, and make sure
someone from derivatives

19:01.320 --> 19:04.240
knows they're coming.
Fab. OK, thanks so much.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.720
MS HOUGHTON:  Whoa!

19:05.720 --> 19:07.720
It's like the front row
at SeaWorld here.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.320
OK, see if you can grab a leg.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.880
SUCTION

19:12.200 --> 19:14.800
Um, I'm pretty sure that's an arm.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.640
It's been a long time since
I've been at med school, but...

19:17.640 --> 19:20.320
Do you want to have another try
of the lucky dip there, Shruti?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.440
Got it. Beautiful!

19:23.440 --> 19:25.920
Right, yeah, I think I can see
what the problem is.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.880
Any idea how
he might have got in there?

19:40.360 --> 19:43.080
First baby coming up.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.760
BABY CRIES

19:44.760 --> 19:47.160
Hooray!

19:48.240 --> 19:49.480
Look.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.280
OK.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.160
Stick or twist?

20:04.560 --> 20:06.800
All right. Guys, she's going again.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.280
Erm, one question.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.360
Why have you got a bottle in here?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.760
It's got my mum's piss in it.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.200
Forgive me for asking
a follow-up question...

20:16.200 --> 20:18.320
It's a drug test
for my probation officer.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.800
You're creating a lot of
paperwork for me here.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.680
How about...I fell on it?

20:24.680 --> 20:26.480
We have a winner.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.920
Oi, oi, oi. I need that.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.400
Give me my shit, man.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.680
BABY CRIES

20:43.680 --> 20:45.520
Two for the price of one. Hooray!

20:48.680 --> 20:50.120
Hello, sweetheart.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.160
Right, what do you reckon, are we
going in for number three?  Mm-hm.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.200
You're doing great.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.080
Respect.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.880
Thanks for that.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.000
Empathy.  Lovely, Ian. Thanks.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.400
Confidentiality?  Terrific!

21:10.440 --> 21:13.000
Erm, compassion.  Great!

21:18.040 --> 21:20.120
Next time I'm pregnant
with triplets,

21:20.120 --> 21:21.520
I'm getting you to do them.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.640
Bang-up job there.  Thank you.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.080
Oh, shit!  What?

21:26.080 --> 21:28.200
I think you left
some scissors inside her.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.280
You'd better open her up again.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.640
Oh! Erm... OK. I'm so sorry!
I, erm...

21:34.640 --> 21:36.240
MS HOUGHTON LAUGHS

21:36.240 --> 21:37.880
Gotcha!

21:37.880 --> 21:39.600
Oh...

21:42.200 --> 21:44.440
SHE CONTINUES LAUGHING

21:47.440 --> 21:49.160
Ms Houghton, erm,

21:49.160 --> 21:51.440
I was wondering if you might
have a free moment for me

21:51.440 --> 21:53.520
to pick your brain about something?
About work, really.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.440
I can pop by your office
if you've got a free minute.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.200
Sounds awful. Here's a better idea.
How about we do it

21:58.200 --> 22:00.720
over a quattro stagioni
and a bottle of Jacob's Creek?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.760
Well, I wouldn't want to
take up too much of your time.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.600
Do I look like I eat slowly?

22:04.600 --> 22:07.880
Finish off the skin. I need to take
my lung medicine.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.600
MAN CRIES OUT

22:22.560 --> 22:24.280
Dr Kay?

22:24.280 --> 22:25.600
I was told you'd be down here.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.640
My sister's in bits, thinking
she's endangered her baby.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.280
Erm, I'm sorry, I don't know what...
How could you say that to her?

22:30.280 --> 22:31.600
You don't understand.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.920
I, er, I didn't say
that she had, erm...

22:36.440 --> 22:39.680
I, erm, had worked two shifts
back-to-back

22:39.680 --> 22:42.400
the day I delivered her,
I'd slept for three hours

22:42.400 --> 22:44.920
in two nights. There was all
this pressure at the hospital.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.720
I had to miss
my best friend's stag do.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.480
How dare you try
and make me feel bad!

22:50.480 --> 22:52.400
We're exercising our legal rights.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.880
Your mistake had consequences
for my sister and my nephew.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.280
And that's going to have
consequences for you.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.440
OK, next one.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.120
"Suffers from." "Suffers from."

23:08.120 --> 23:10.120
What do we say instead?

23:11.840 --> 23:15.080
"Lives with"?  "Lives with," yeah.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.720
Thanks, Ian. OK, next one.
"Disabled."

23:17.720 --> 23:20.360
"Differently abled."
"Differently abled"!

23:20.360 --> 23:23.320
Well, the blue team are on fire!

23:23.320 --> 23:26.680
Er, yeah,
question from the red team.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.160
Tracy?  What's wrong
with saying "disabled"?

23:29.160 --> 23:31.840
Remember this morning?
We talked about inclusivity.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.120
This is what we call a...

23:34.120 --> 23:36.080
"Negative."  "Negative," yeah.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.000
Thanks, Ian. And we shouldn't
be using negatives.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.160
All that will happen is that
the patients won't understand

23:40.160 --> 23:41.800
what we're talking to them about.
Isn't it "clients"?

23:41.800 --> 23:43.800
Yeah, it is "clients", actually.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.800
Erm, next one.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.240
"Birth defect."

23:49.240 --> 23:51.400
We haven't got
a working printer on our ward.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.560
We've had a leak in the ceiling
for over four years,

23:54.560 --> 23:56.760
and this is what they're
spending their money on?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.000
As your facilitator,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.320
it's my job to remind you
of the four pillars of the trust.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.680
OK? PAGER BEEPS

24:03.680 --> 24:05.640
PAGER:  ..crash call
to Accident & Emergency.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.320
That's obstetric team...

24:07.320 --> 24:08.880
HE SIGHS

24:09.920 --> 24:11.640
I should... I should probably...

24:18.240 --> 24:19.440
ALARM BLARES

24:21.760 --> 24:24.680
Adam Kay, obstetrics.
Who's running the arrest?

24:24.680 --> 24:27.880
Kiran Chowdry, A&E.
That was quick. Good man.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.760
Came in feeling
short of breath. 37 weeks,

24:29.760 --> 24:31.400
first baby, collapsed
on her way to the cubicle.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.000
No respiratory effort,
no pulse for three minutes now.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.840
I want to stay with my wife!

24:36.840 --> 24:38.240
Get me a scalpel.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
Perimortem section.  What, now? Here?

24:40.240 --> 24:42.160
You've had one cycle of CPR
with no output.

24:42.160 --> 24:45.000
I'm delivering.
You done this before?  Yep.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.320
Well, I've delivered babies before.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.640
FATHER GASPS

24:47.640 --> 24:49.600
Scissors.  Scissors.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.880
I'm delivering. Off the chest.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.760
Help me?  Yep.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.920
This is a case of nothing to lose.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.160
The patient is basically
already dead.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.240
The baby is pressing against
her major blood vessels.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.520
This is our only chance
of resuscitating her.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.000
OK, pull.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.360
You'll notice the slight lack
of blood.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.920
Dead patients don't tend
to pump any blood around.

25:18.800 --> 25:19.960
Push.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.200
OK.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.080
Adam?

25:46.760 --> 25:49.480
HE SOBS

25:51.800 --> 25:53.600
One...  Keep pumping it.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.480
..two, three...

25:57.320 --> 25:59.400
..four, five...

26:03.640 --> 26:07.520
Heart rate is below 60.

26:07.520 --> 26:08.960
TRACY:  OK. Ready?
PAEDIATRICIAN:  Yeah.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.160
One, two, three.  One.
One, two, three.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.600
Two.  One, two, three.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.360
Three.  One, two, three.

26:15.360 --> 26:19.040
Four.  One, two, three.  Five.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.320
BABY CRIES Yeah! Hello, darling!

26:21.320 --> 26:23.320
Hello, sweetheart!

26:24.400 --> 26:26.240
FATHER:  You saved the wrong one!

26:27.680 --> 26:30.480
You saved...
You saved the wrong one!

26:31.960 --> 26:33.440
Come on, love.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.400
DR CHOWDRY:  OK, pull CPR.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.760
What about direct cardiac massage?

26:42.760 --> 26:44.320
What? You mean open the chest?

26:44.320 --> 26:46.560
Do it through the diaphragm.
Come on!

26:46.560 --> 26:49.200
DR CHOWDRY:  OK, pause compressions.

26:50.240 --> 26:53.120
What's... What's happening?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.600
There's cardiac output.
Are you still massaging?

27:03.600 --> 27:05.880
No. She's doing that herself.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.480
Right. OK.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.200
Large swabs!

27:12.200 --> 27:15.200
Now, quickly! And we need
to get her into theatre.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.880
Hold this tight until
the second she's in theatre.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.880
Right, let's get her
onto a trolley. Come on.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.880
Fucking hell, mate. Right, come on,
let's get a wiggle on.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.720
NURSE:  Ready? One, two, three.

27:25.720 --> 27:29.240
Lift!  Do you want to close up
or just have a massive brandy?

27:29.240 --> 27:31.440
Er, do you mind doing it?

27:31.440 --> 27:34.000
That's proper obstetrics there.
You did amazing.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.040
"Ly."

27:38.040 --> 27:39.360
"You did amazingly."

27:43.840 --> 27:46.360
FATHER:  Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you!

27:51.280 --> 27:54.120
Thank you, thank you! Thank you!

27:54.120 --> 27:55.400
Thank you! Thank you!

27:58.720 --> 28:00.320
Theatre 2 ready now.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.240
Er, Dr Kay? Can I have a word?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.480
HE SIGHS

28:37.120 --> 28:39.800
Some of us
have been delivering triplets.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.880
How was it?

28:41.880 --> 28:45.960
Yeah, it was great. I can't believe
I actually managed it.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.240
Mm. We were all quite shocked.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.160
How was A&E?

28:51.120 --> 28:53.040
Yeah, you know, the usual crap.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.000
Had a bit of good news, though.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.400
You're finally going on that
communication skills course?

28:58.400 --> 29:00.840
Um, Erika dropped the complaint.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.760
Oh, my God!

29:03.760 --> 29:05.880
Are you serious? How the hell
did you manage that?

29:05.880 --> 29:08.480
You don't want to know
how the sausage gets made.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.720
But you can sleep easy tonight.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.600
Sleep? No, I'll revise easy.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.840
Oh, Adam, I'm really worried
about the lady in Room Five.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.160
Would you mind taking a look?
I'm leaving now.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.160
I don't think I've ever
said those words before.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.120
Shruti's more than capable
of looking after your patient.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.760
I've definitely never
said those words before.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.240
Jesus! I was expecting
to wait here two hours.

29:59.200 --> 30:03.320
Don't worry. This is just
a hologram. Adam's still at work.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.080
Knew it.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.080
OK...

30:10.920 --> 30:12.160
Hm!

30:16.280 --> 30:17.400
Very good.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.120
How was work?  It was fi...

30:27.320 --> 30:28.480
You know what? It was brilliant.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.640
This pregnant woman collapsed
straight in front of me in A&E,

30:31.640 --> 30:33.960
so I took a scalpel and, erm...

30:33.960 --> 30:36.480
How much gory detail do you want?

30:36.480 --> 30:39.520
All of it. Unless it's going
to put me off my dinner.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.160
You know, the weird thing
about being a doctor

30:42.160 --> 30:45.640
is that everyone thinks
you're always saving lives.

30:45.640 --> 30:49.880
But, actually, it's pretty rare
to be able to say that today,

30:49.880 --> 30:51.880
I literally... PHONE CHIMES

30:51.880 --> 30:53.240
Oh!

30:55.960 --> 30:58.640
HE CHUCKLES PJ and Kenzie.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.000
They're going out later.
PJ and Kenzie?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.040
Didn't they get knocked out
at Judges' Houses?

31:03.040 --> 31:04.600
You've met them.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.320
PJ's 21st on the roof of...

31:07.320 --> 31:09.360
Oh, no, you were working,
weren't you?

31:09.360 --> 31:10.640
You know Ian?  Yes, I do.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.160
He looks a bit like Ian.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.280
Can I get you an aperitif
to kick things off?

31:14.280 --> 31:17.200
Mm, I'll have a champagne,
please. Non-vintage.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.360
And I'll have a Foster's. Vintage.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.120
Oh!

31:29.640 --> 31:31.640
Guess, er, guess what's in here.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.080
Oh, I love this game.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.680
Is it the bullet that killed
Tupac Shakur?

31:35.680 --> 31:38.120
No, no, the complete works
of Shakespeare

31:38.120 --> 31:41.080
written on a grain of rice.
A butt plug for a cat?

31:52.240 --> 31:54.240
HE EXHALES

31:57.200 --> 31:58.440
It's beautiful.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.760
The cat's going to love it.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.640
You know what it is?

32:27.360 --> 32:28.760
It's, erm...

32:30.000 --> 32:31.280
An engagement ring?

32:31.280 --> 32:33.080
So, you remember
our first weekend away?

32:33.080 --> 32:34.360
At the Giant's Causeway?

32:34.360 --> 32:38.160
This was the penny you put in the
machine that squidged it down.

32:38.160 --> 32:41.120
And I, erm...I made it into a ring.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.240
Well, don't just stare at it.
Put it on.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.400
I hope you like it.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.640
You're kind of wearing it
for ever now, so...

32:59.680 --> 33:01.080
I love it.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.880
Good, cos God knows how
I turn it back into a penny.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.960
HE EXHALES

33:11.320 --> 33:13.240
Right, so, where are we going to

33:13.240 --> 33:14.960
have the engagement party, then?

33:16.360 --> 33:18.080
Er, we could have a little, erm...

33:19.760 --> 33:22.200
..dinner party at our, er, our flat.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.160
Yeah, we could totally do that.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.280
Or we could do something fun.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.520
PHONE CHIMES Sure.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.280
Oh, PJ and Kenzie are asking
if we want to go to Squirt.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.160
Not for the engagement party?
After dinner.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.280
Oh!  What do you reckon?

33:38.560 --> 33:40.920
Sure.  Although we should ask
if they do functions.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.000
How does your mum feel
about harnesses?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.720
MS HOUGHTON:  So, we're all standing
there,

33:49.720 --> 33:52.480
staring at this X-ray
of an 80-year-old woman,

33:52.480 --> 33:55.160
wondering why she's got a load
of tiny little bones inside her.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.080
I said, "All right,

33:57.080 --> 33:58.960
"get her in the stirrups,"

33:58.960 --> 34:00.600
had a rummage around.

34:00.600 --> 34:04.080
Turns out she's got half a box
of KFC shoved up there.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.640
Oh, my God!

34:08.480 --> 34:10.680
Wow!  Do you want some more wine?

34:10.680 --> 34:13.080
Oh, just a little bit. Thank you.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.400
That's... That's fine, thank you.

34:16.640 --> 34:17.720
Top-up.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.920
Erm, this is so kind of you,
seriously.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.800
Honestly, it means so much
to have a consultant

34:26.800 --> 34:28.440
just, like, give me some time.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.120
Ah, we've got to stick together,
don't we, mate?

34:31.120 --> 34:33.640
I mean, yeah, I mean,
I honestly thought

34:33.640 --> 34:36.120
I was, like, the only doctor
in the country who wasn't

34:36.120 --> 34:38.960
the captain of a quidditch team
at some poncey private school.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.680
Full disclosure, mate.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.920
My dad's the Duke of Bedford.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.320
Oh, my God.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.160
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.120
I-I didn't mean to offend you.
I was just...

34:50.120 --> 34:52.080
He played darts in
the Duke of Bedford.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.600
Oh!

34:54.600 --> 34:56.560
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

34:57.800 --> 35:00.960
Erm, oh, OK. Erm...

35:00.960 --> 35:02.560
Well, er...

35:03.520 --> 35:06.760
Er, well, you know that Caesarean
today?  Yeah.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.120
It felt like the first time I'd
actually done something right

35:09.120 --> 35:10.520
at work.  Huh!

35:10.520 --> 35:12.760
I just feel
so incompetent there.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.040
The whole time, you know?

35:14.040 --> 35:16.240
Like a total fraud.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.920
And I'm lying to my parents,

35:17.920 --> 35:21.920
because they are so proud
of what they think I've achieved.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.160
So much of the job is just so...

35:25.520 --> 35:27.480
Oh, it's just no-one tells you
how upsetting it is.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.800
Do you know what I mean?

35:28.800 --> 35:31.600
I feel like I'm the first doctor
to have cried in the toilet.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.720
And, you know, like,
patients almost bleed to death,

35:34.720 --> 35:36.680
and babies get sick, and...

35:36.680 --> 35:38.920
..a husband basically assaulted me.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.640
And everyone else is, like,
"Fine, yeah,

35:41.640 --> 35:43.520
"this is just the job."

35:43.520 --> 35:44.760
It's not fine!

35:46.120 --> 35:47.160
Is it?

35:48.760 --> 35:50.240
And where's the support?

35:52.120 --> 35:54.080
And even if there was any,
I wouldn't have time,

35:54.080 --> 35:56.680
because I'm working 14 hours
a day and then revising

35:56.680 --> 36:01.200
in between for God knows
how many more. I just feel so...

36:03.080 --> 36:04.880
..so constantly overwhelmed.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.360
Like you're permanently
fighting fires

36:06.360 --> 36:07.600
and you haven't got the right kit.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.560
Yeah!

36:10.560 --> 36:12.160
Yeah, that is exactly it.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.000
Are you sure you're
in the right job?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.040
What do you mean?

36:18.040 --> 36:19.600
Well, it's a difficult job.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.960
What do you want me to say?
"It gets easier"? It doesn't.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.920
By the time you retire,
there's going to be a bus load

36:24.920 --> 36:26.800
of dead babies with your name on it.

36:26.800 --> 36:31.320
If you can't handle that fact,
maybe you should get out now.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.360
Well, no-one's making you
be here, are they?

36:33.360 --> 36:35.880
That's just you and
some fucked-up fantasy

36:35.880 --> 36:38.480
you've got about
what your parents will think.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.360
You need to decide, number one,

36:41.360 --> 36:44.360
do you really want to be doing this,

36:44.360 --> 36:47.000
and, more importantly, number two,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
are we going to get another glass
of limoncello in, or what?

36:54.760 --> 36:55.920
Yeah, sure.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.040
MUSIC POUNDS

37:04.240 --> 37:05.560
LAUGHTER

37:09.200 --> 37:11.160
Hey, there's a queue here, ladies.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.760
Harry Muir plus one.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.160
I can't see it here, love.

37:15.160 --> 37:18.600
Oh, well, we tried.
Have a...lovely evening.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.320
All right, Grandad.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.760
Erm, it could be under Kenzie.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.040
THEY SIGH Hang on, let me look.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.960
We don't want to put you out.
It doesn't matter.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.280
Come on!

37:27.280 --> 37:29.360
What the point of being engaged
if we can't brag about it?

37:29.360 --> 37:30.480
Er, or PJ, maybe.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.520
Oh, here y'are. Go on, get in.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.920
Thanks a bunch.
Now I have to go in here.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.960
Well, he seems fun, love.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.640
Hey, cut it out.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.160
Erm, excuse me?

38:07.160 --> 38:08.680
Hey!

38:08.680 --> 38:10.200
Hello?

38:11.280 --> 38:13.960
Honey? Two, please.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.320
Thanks.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.360
Oh, my God, you must be
the famous Adam.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.120
I've heard so much about you.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.640
I'm PJ.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.720
It doesn't ring a bell.

38:29.080 --> 38:32.160
No. Goodness, no.
I thought it was a mint.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.600
I can't. I'd get struck off.
I'm a doctor.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.640
Yeah. I heard.

38:37.640 --> 38:41.560
Shot?  I don't do those either,
I'm...  Oh, my God, come on.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.640
Everyone's doing them.  Yeah, I don't
generally do things

38:44.640 --> 38:46.760
just because everyone does them.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.160
I only asked if you wanted
to do a shot,

38:49.160 --> 38:50.760
not commit mass murder.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.240
Oh, I'd do that.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.720
Who's that over there?

38:58.720 --> 39:00.400
That one there.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.560
The really hot one
dancing with Harry?

39:06.080 --> 39:07.400
That's Kenzie.

39:11.160 --> 39:14.200
That's Kenzie. Erm, you know what?

39:14.200 --> 39:15.920
I will have a couple of shots.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.520
I only offered you one.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.760
Cheers.  Cheers.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.040
OK, come on, let's go join them.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.280
I don't.... I'm fine.
What's it going to take?!

39:25.280 --> 39:26.880
Some kind of major cerebral event.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.520
Jesus, come on!

39:28.520 --> 39:31.040
Please...  Come on!

39:32.080 --> 39:34.120
Guys? This is Adam.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.720
I can see why you've kept him
hidden away.

39:51.560 --> 39:54.800
# House of jealous lovers

39:54.800 --> 39:58.760
# One hand ties the other

39:58.760 --> 40:02.440
# House of jealous lovers... #

40:04.400 --> 40:05.920
MUSIC CONTINUES

40:15.880 --> 40:18.600
Breath of fresh air, love?  Yeah.

40:18.600 --> 40:22.520
I wasn't really into the cheap
cologne and aerosolised semen.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.600
I know what'll cheer you up.
Why don't you buy me a drink?

40:26.680 --> 40:27.960
I'm with someone.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.960
Well, that's nice.
Has he got your wallet?

40:29.960 --> 40:32.760
Can you just leave me alone?  Gladly.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.560
You know what, love?

40:35.560 --> 40:37.840
If you go round life
hating everyone you meet,

40:37.840 --> 40:39.120
maybe you hate yourself.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.960
You not coming back in
for another dance?

40:47.960 --> 40:51.600
Well, honestly, I would if the music
was less shit and I was less boring.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.120
Boring? You're not boring.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.200
Everyone's been raving about you.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.680
Well...

40:56.680 --> 40:59.280
..not raving, but PJ was...

40:59.280 --> 41:00.880
..definitely positive.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.160
Overall.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.520
You're all I talk about
to them, you know?

41:11.400 --> 41:14.160
Shall we escape?  We can have a...

41:14.160 --> 41:16.360
..little dance.

41:16.360 --> 41:18.560
I thought you said
you didn't like the music.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.120
Not in there.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.080
What?  I've got some moves.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.280
No, no, don't worry,
we'll fix that before the wedding.

41:35.440 --> 41:40.600
# Should I try to hide the way

41:40.600 --> 41:42.800
# I feel inside

41:42.800 --> 41:47.120
# My heart for you?

41:47.120 --> 41:50.920
# Would you say that you

41:50.920 --> 41:54.440
# Would try to love me too?

41:54.440 --> 41:57.000
# In your mind

41:57.000 --> 41:58.520
# Could you ever be

41:58.520 --> 42:00.880
# Really close to me?

42:00.880 --> 42:04.400
# I can tell the way you smile

42:04.400 --> 42:06.280
# If I feel that I

42:06.280 --> 42:08.160
# Could be certain then

42:08.160 --> 42:12.880
# I would say the things
I want to say tonight

42:14.160 --> 42:17.160
# But till I can see

42:17.160 --> 42:20.800
# That you'd really care for me

42:21.800 --> 42:23.520
# I will dream

42:23.520 --> 42:25.480
# That some day you'll be

42:25.480 --> 42:27.400
# Really close to me

42:27.400 --> 42:30.720
# I can tell the way you smile

42:30.720 --> 42:34.040
# If I feel that I

42:34.040 --> 42:36.040
# Could be certain then

42:36.040 --> 42:40.360
# I would say the things
I want to say tonight

42:41.680 --> 42:44.600
# But till I can see

42:44.600 --> 42:48.360
# That you'd really care for me

42:48.360 --> 42:51.200
# I'll keep trying to hide

42:51.200 --> 42:54.120
# The way I feel inside. #

43:08.800 --> 43:12.160
# Just another one of those days

43:17.640 --> 43:21.320
# Days you're hanging on
by a thread... #
