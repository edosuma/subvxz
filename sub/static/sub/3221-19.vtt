WEBVTT

00:03.987 --> 00:06.157
Bring me creatures.
Aim high on the food chain.

00:06.622 --> 00:08.141
Whatever we bag, ends up there.

00:08.524 --> 00:11.594
That's where he tortures them,
interrogates them. I don't really know.

00:12.195 --> 00:14.505
- We ain't your employees.
- Of course you are.

00:16.366 --> 00:17.706
- What's in the bag?
- You are.

00:18.067 --> 00:20.237
- Not possible.
- You didn't hide your bones well.

00:28.011 --> 00:29.911
Who is she, this Eve bitch?

00:30.346 --> 00:33.976
The mother of
all of us and the end of all of you.

00:36.219 --> 00:38.589
The ashes
of a phoenix can burn the mother.

00:39.088 --> 00:41.518
"1861. Sunrise, Wyoming.

00:42.025 --> 00:45.865
Gun killed a phoenix today.
Left a pile of smoldering ash."

00:46.562 --> 00:47.732
- Whose gun?
- Colt's.

00:48.064 --> 00:49.964
We hop back in time,
join with Samuel Colt...

00:50.400 --> 00:53.330
we hunt the phoenix,
and then haul its ashes back home.

00:59.876 --> 01:01.626
- Is that what I think it is?
- A phoenix.

01:02.045 --> 01:04.415
You know what this means.
We take the fight to her.

01:12.388 --> 01:15.078
- I'm serious. I'm serious.
- That was way overpriced, dude.

01:16.459 --> 01:19.769
- Where I'm from, it was like $3 a beer.
- Okay. Then I'm buying next time.

01:20.396 --> 01:22.616
I'm not even lying.
I'm not even joking at all.

01:23.199 --> 01:24.129
Hey.

01:24.901 --> 01:27.091
Heaven must be missing an angel.

01:38.347 --> 01:39.987
I think she likes me.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.180
Okay, Fabio. Let's go.

02:00.436 --> 02:02.186
Are you okay, miss?

02:02.605 --> 02:03.535
I'm perfect.

02:04.073 --> 02:06.563
I mean, is that blood?

02:09.011 --> 02:10.471
Yes, I suppose it is.

02:11.147 --> 02:12.257
You sure you're all right?

02:13.549 --> 02:15.859
<i>I was one of the lonely people</i>

02:16.352 --> 02:20.132
<i>Now you're lying close to me
Making love to me</i>

02:20.923 --> 02:23.143
<i>I believe in miracles</i>

02:24.994 --> 02:26.334
<i>Where you from?</i>

02:26.929 --> 02:30.269
<i>You sexy thing I believe</i>

02:31.134 --> 02:33.324
- Hey, what the hell?
- I gave him a gift.

02:33.803 --> 02:36.523
<i>Since you came along
You sexy thing</i>

02:37.073 --> 02:39.003
Come on, man. Let's get out of here.

02:58.127 --> 03:01.227
<i>Did you know
You're everything I prayed for?</i>

03:02.732 --> 03:05.952
<i>Did you know?
Every night and day for</i>

03:06.569 --> 03:10.289
<i>Every day
You give love and satisfaction</i>

03:10.973 --> 03:12.783
<i>Now you're lying next to me</i>

03:13.209 --> 03:15.759
<i>Giving it to me I believe</i>

03:46.375 --> 03:47.685
Hey. Unh.

03:48.344 --> 03:49.514
How you doing?

03:49.845 --> 03:52.425
Five shells, that's how I'm doing.

03:54.116 --> 03:56.866
Well, you know, it's a hell of a lot more
then we had last week.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.410
Maybe.

03:59.388 --> 04:00.318
Meaning?

04:00.623 --> 04:04.813
Meaning I just had myself a little mishap a
few minutes ago and, uh... Well, here, look.

04:06.796 --> 04:07.696
Whoa.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.503
- Huh.
- This stuff is supposed to...

04:12.902 --> 04:14.212
burn the bejesus out of Eve.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.029
- Doesn't even give me a sunburn.
- The lore says it works.

04:17.540 --> 04:18.589
That's always reliable.

04:19.608 --> 04:23.509
Well, you know what?
Maybe it's like iron or silver, you know?

04:24.213 --> 04:25.293
Hurts them, not us?

04:25.615 --> 04:28.635
Maybe, but a fat lot of good it does us
till we find the bitch.

04:29.218 --> 04:32.348
I'm looking, but I'm thinking
maybe it's time you made a call.

04:34.824 --> 04:36.284
Why's it always gotta be me, huh?

04:36.659 --> 04:39.439
It's not like Cass lives in my ass.
The dude's busy.

04:40.630 --> 04:43.410
- Cass, get out of my ass.
- I was never in your...

04:46.902 --> 04:48.682
Have you made any progress
in locating Eve?

04:50.273 --> 04:51.703
We were gonna ask you about that.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.154
No, I've looked,
but she's hidden from me.

04:54.610 --> 04:55.980
She's hidden from all angels.

04:56.345 --> 04:57.775
Awesome.

04:58.414 --> 05:01.104
You know, what we really need
is an inside man.

05:02.184 --> 05:04.794
- What do you mean?
- Something with claws and sympathy.

05:06.322 --> 05:07.342
Like a friendly monster?

05:08.591 --> 05:10.231
Those are in short supply these days.

05:10.626 --> 05:12.816
Sure, but we've met
one or two, right?

05:13.296 --> 05:14.436
Maybe.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.814
So maybe we can find one.

05:34.984 --> 05:36.124
Lenore.

05:36.619 --> 05:39.899
Wait. Wait. Wait. Hey, hey.
Lenore. Stop.

05:40.523 --> 05:41.813
Look...

05:42.625 --> 05:43.855
we're happy you're here.

05:45.461 --> 05:46.861
<i>- My name's Lenore.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

05:50.866 --> 05:52.326
It's been a long time.

05:52.702 --> 05:54.432
You remember us?

05:55.371 --> 05:56.921
I remember.

05:57.306 --> 05:59.006
Your hunter friend almost killed me.

05:59.408 --> 06:02.278
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
he turned into a vampire...

06:02.845 --> 06:04.485
and I chopped his head off.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.400
Yeah, with razor wire. Wicked.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.084
Well, that's something.

06:11.253 --> 06:12.483
What's going on?

06:12.822 --> 06:13.752
Why am I here?

06:14.056 --> 06:15.346
Well, um...

06:16.125 --> 06:17.265
That's Cass.

06:17.860 --> 06:19.230
He's our friend.

06:19.895 --> 06:22.235
And we need to talk to you.

06:23.833 --> 06:24.853
About Eve.

06:26.202 --> 06:27.782
Eve?

06:28.170 --> 06:30.450
I have nothing to say about Eve.

06:30.940 --> 06:33.280
- You sure about that?
- I'm trying to stay away from her.

06:33.776 --> 06:35.476
Believe me.

06:35.878 --> 06:36.868
Where's your nest?

06:38.247 --> 06:39.267
Gone.

06:39.582 --> 06:41.832
I couldn't fight it anymore.

06:42.585 --> 06:45.655
It's her voice, in our heads.

06:47.523 --> 06:48.983
What it does to us.

06:50.593 --> 06:54.053
- So they left, started killing again.
- But not you.

06:54.697 --> 06:56.367
Don't look so impressed.

06:56.766 --> 06:59.756
I was hiding in a basement,
not exactly Club Med.

07:01.404 --> 07:04.834
You don't know how hard it is
not to give in.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.108
Everyone gives in.

07:08.577 --> 07:12.117
So this psychic two-way you got, that
mean you know where Mom's camped?

07:12.782 --> 07:14.092
You've got to be kidding me.

07:14.450 --> 07:16.150
You want me to tell you where she is?

07:16.552 --> 07:19.042
You do know she could be listening to us
right now.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.089
I might as well be a video camera.
What are you thinking?

07:23.692 --> 07:25.832
So we don't have
the element of surprise.

07:26.295 --> 07:28.575
- We're still going in.
- You're crazy.

07:29.298 --> 07:31.408
- I can't help you.
- Can't or won't?

07:32.802 --> 07:35.552
Look, it's clear as day,
you still give a crap.

07:36.572 --> 07:40.002
You don't wanna kill and you don't want
this whole planet dead.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.284
You actually believe you can stop her?

07:45.948 --> 07:48.028
Just tell us where she is.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.593
Grants Pass, Oregon.

07:53.856 --> 07:56.136
- And now she knows you're coming.
- Well, let's go see.

07:56.625 --> 07:57.675
Hold on.

07:57.993 --> 08:00.863
I didn't tell you this out of the goodness
of my heart.

08:01.430 --> 08:02.360
I need something.

08:03.032 --> 08:04.432
What?

08:07.002 --> 08:08.702
- Kill me.
- Lenore...

08:09.104 --> 08:12.204
We'll lock you down till this is over.
Witness protection. You'll be safe.

08:12.808 --> 08:15.418
You don't get it. It's not about that.

08:15.945 --> 08:17.435
I'm dangerous.

08:17.813 --> 08:19.123
I hear her voice all the time.

08:19.482 --> 08:22.732
- You're not like the rest of them.
- I'm exactly like them.

08:23.886 --> 08:25.316
I fed.

08:25.688 --> 08:27.058
I couldn't help it.

08:27.656 --> 08:29.586
The girl couldn't have been
more than 16, Sam.

08:31.527 --> 08:33.227
I'll do it again.

08:33.629 --> 08:34.558
I can't stop.

08:35.764 --> 08:37.164
Not anymore.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.553
- You have to. Please.
- Lenore...

08:54.483 --> 08:56.673
We needed to move this along.

09:09.398 --> 09:14.178
Well, I was expecting
more <i>Zombieland, </i> less <i>Pleasantville.</i>

09:15.004 --> 09:17.054
Just because it looks quiet
don't mean it is.

09:17.506 --> 09:19.346
Especially if she's got a clue
we're coming.

09:19.808 --> 09:22.998
Yeah, well, if she is here, I'm glad we
got Smitey McSmiterton on our squad.

09:24.046 --> 09:25.796
All right. Where do we start?

09:26.215 --> 09:28.235
I'm gonna need a computer.

09:34.857 --> 09:35.937
All right.

09:36.525 --> 09:39.545
I finally got the police database.
No thanks to this.

09:40.129 --> 09:42.119
- I asked for a computer.
- It is a computer.

09:42.565 --> 09:44.375
No, a computer has buttons.

09:44.833 --> 09:47.203
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, we're good. Thanks.

09:47.836 --> 09:51.116
- Anything?
- Oh. Nickel-and-dime stuff, nothing weird.

09:51.740 --> 09:52.790
Basically, dead end.

09:54.143 --> 09:55.813
You think Vampira was lying?

09:56.211 --> 09:58.431
I'll search the town.
Give me a moment.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.490
Cass, we can still see you.

10:07.056 --> 10:08.016
Yeah, I'm still here.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.497
Okay, well, you don't have to
wait on us. You...

10:13.929 --> 10:16.179
Well, now it just looks like
you're pooping.

10:17.466 --> 10:19.456
- Something's wrong.
- What, are you stuck?

10:20.102 --> 10:21.412
I'm blocked.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.366
- I'm powerless.
- You're joking.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.889
Something in this town is, uh...

10:29.878 --> 10:30.808
It's affecting me.

10:31.113 --> 10:32.483
I assume it's Eve.

10:32.881 --> 10:34.371
So wait. Mom's making you limp?

10:35.517 --> 10:36.627
Figuratively, yes.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.256
- How?
- I don't know, but she is.

10:39.688 --> 10:42.708
Great, because without your power,
you're just a baby in a trench coat.

10:49.198 --> 10:51.158
I think you hurt his feelings.

10:52.601 --> 10:55.971
I got something here, maybe.
Had to go federal to get it.

10:56.605 --> 10:59.035
Call went out from the local office
to the CDC last night.

10:59.541 --> 11:00.501
About what?

11:00.809 --> 11:05.319
A Dr. Silver called in an illness
he couldn't identify.

11:06.315 --> 11:11.355
Patient's a 25-year-old African American
named Ed Bright.

11:14.323 --> 11:15.843
Well, that's not much to go on.

11:16.225 --> 11:18.975
- Well, it's our only lead, so...
- So beggars can't be choosers.

11:19.528 --> 11:20.988
All right, well, let's finish up.

11:21.363 --> 11:23.643
Excuse me. Hi. Uh, is Dr. Silver in today?

11:24.333 --> 11:26.503
My friend is very sick.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.836
I have a, uh...

11:29.705 --> 11:32.045
painful burning sensation.

11:32.541 --> 11:35.001
Oh, well, he's out. Sorry.

11:35.511 --> 11:37.471
- Do you know where he is?
- He hasn't called in.

11:38.180 --> 11:39.990
You might wanna find yourself
some ointment.

11:44.887 --> 11:48.897
What kind of doctor calls the CDC
and then goes AWOL the very next day?

11:50.225 --> 11:51.805
Let's have a look, shall we?

12:10.045 --> 12:12.185
Is this gonna take a long time?

12:17.386 --> 12:18.846
What is it?

12:34.837 --> 12:36.127
Oh.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.117
- It's Ed Bright.
- What kind of doctor calls the CDC...

12:41.643 --> 12:43.543
then stashes the gooey corpse
in his shed?

12:44.012 --> 12:46.532
I don't understand
what's happening here.

12:48.217 --> 12:51.647
Well, I know one thing about the body,
we need some kerosene.

12:54.289 --> 12:57.249
Here. Dr. Silver. Wife, two sons.

12:59.094 --> 12:59.994
Uh-oh.

13:00.462 --> 13:03.122
- Hi there.
- Hi.

13:03.665 --> 13:05.305
Who are you?

13:08.403 --> 13:09.573
You Casual Friday agents?

13:10.305 --> 13:12.935
We were on a case a few miles out.
We got a call to come here.

13:13.475 --> 13:16.085
- You, what's your business?
- Dr. Silver's a friend of mine.

13:16.779 --> 13:19.269
He didn't show up for work,
I thought I'd see if he's sick.

13:20.115 --> 13:21.405
Not sick. Missing.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.680
Missing? Says who?

13:24.119 --> 13:27.899
Says me. Empty house, no bags packed,
car still in the driveway.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.868
- Well, how'd you get on this?
- Oh, it's a long story.

13:32.361 --> 13:35.291
Why don't you put out an APB? We'll
compare notes down at the station.

13:35.864 --> 13:38.204
- Sound good?
- Uh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.130
Obliged.

13:41.270 --> 13:43.110
Wow, talk about
talking out of your butt.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.822
Yeah. Just hurry, idiot.

14:01.824 --> 14:04.814
So we got a missing doctor
and an oozy patient, huh?

14:05.394 --> 14:06.354
Yeah, plot thickens.

14:06.662 --> 14:08.852
Well, let's go see what Ed's roommates
have to say.

14:09.331 --> 14:12.431
- Does Ed Bright have a brother?
- No. Why?

14:13.368 --> 14:15.388
Then that's not his twin.

14:17.372 --> 14:18.482
So, what, shifter?

14:18.807 --> 14:21.587
- I don't know what we're looking at.
- Dean and me are gonna go in.

14:22.144 --> 14:24.364
Stay, watch the door.
Something comes out, shoot it.

14:24.847 --> 14:28.067
- Best guess, silver bullets.
- I'm fairly unpracticed with firearms.

14:30.552 --> 14:32.282
You know who whines?

14:32.688 --> 14:33.738
Babies.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.845
Okay, don't touch anything.

15:07.617 --> 15:08.577
Hey, hey, back here.

15:08.885 --> 15:09.845
Come here.

15:10.152 --> 15:11.322
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Unh.

15:11.654 --> 15:13.324
Talk to us. What is this?

15:13.723 --> 15:15.183
Hey, Ed. Ed, what's going on?

15:15.558 --> 15:16.728
What?

15:17.059 --> 15:17.989
I'm not Ed.

15:25.134 --> 15:27.304
- What's wrong with me?
- Uh, nothing. You're okay.

15:27.770 --> 15:29.000
We're gonna get you help.

15:29.372 --> 15:30.862
Let me ask you something.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.170
Do I...?

15:32.942 --> 15:34.902
Do all of us...? Do we look like Ed?

15:35.811 --> 15:38.031
What? No, no, no, of course not.

15:38.514 --> 15:40.244
You have a fever.
You're hallucinating.

15:40.650 --> 15:42.490
Marshall. Marshall, hey,
what happened here?

15:43.619 --> 15:44.959
- Am I gonna die?
- No.

15:45.321 --> 15:48.251
You're not gonna die. Now, you need
to talk to us. It's important.

15:49.959 --> 15:51.629
Ed was feeling bad...

15:52.028 --> 15:54.308
so I took him to the doctor.

15:56.599 --> 15:58.999
I think now we're all sick.

15:59.502 --> 16:00.522
You think?

16:00.836 --> 16:03.736
And before you got sick and before Ed
got sick, did you do anything?

16:04.307 --> 16:06.357
Did you go anywhere?
I need you to focus for me.

16:06.809 --> 16:08.329
I don't know.

16:09.145 --> 16:10.695
- Some bar.
- A bar? What bar?

16:11.514 --> 16:13.414
- 8th Street, I guess.
- 8th Street.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.749
Um, did anything happen?
Did you see anything?

16:16.185 --> 16:17.675
Did you meet anyone?

16:18.054 --> 16:19.954
Look, an ambulance
is on the way, okay?

16:20.423 --> 16:21.913
- A girl.
- A girl?

16:22.291 --> 16:23.461
Okay. And?

16:24.126 --> 16:25.236
A girl in white.

16:25.561 --> 16:28.691
Good. Okay.
What did the girl in white do, Marshall?

16:29.298 --> 16:30.288
What did she do to Ed?

16:32.034 --> 16:33.464
Marshall.

16:38.374 --> 16:39.424
I don't get it.

16:39.742 --> 16:42.082
A bunch of regular joes
wake up shifters? What the hell?

16:42.578 --> 16:45.208
Shifters usually run in families.
This looks like an infection.

16:45.948 --> 16:47.618
Nobody touched nothing?

16:48.484 --> 16:50.004
Well, I'm bathing in Purell tonight.

16:50.586 --> 16:53.046
- So he said they met a girl.
- It's gotta be Eve.

16:53.556 --> 16:56.656
- But why would she do this?
- Mommy monster. Make more.

16:57.259 --> 16:59.749
Cass has got a point.
If she's gonna make a shifter army...

17:00.262 --> 17:02.012
why make one that's this sick,
gooey and dying?

17:03.632 --> 17:05.472
Add that to the pile of crap
that don't make sense.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.161
So should we hit the bar?

17:18.481 --> 17:21.060
Well, the sheriff's a mook...

17:21.584 --> 17:24.924
but still, you'd think he'd notice
this many missing folks.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.615
We got a vamp over here.

17:52.515 --> 17:54.325
Nope, scratch that. We got a wraith.

17:56.519 --> 17:58.219
What the hell?

17:58.921 --> 18:02.321
- What has teeth and a spike?
- Never seen that in my life.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.268
Oh, great.
So Eve's making hybrids now?

18:05.761 --> 18:06.811
Looks like.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.089
The question is, why?

18:08.397 --> 18:11.057
I mean, what does she want with a...?
What do you call these?

18:11.600 --> 18:14.410
Well, congrats. You discovered it.
You get to name it.

18:16.672 --> 18:18.512
Jefferson Starships.

18:20.443 --> 18:25.483
Huh? Because they're horrible
and hard to kill.

18:28.651 --> 18:30.731
Looks like the whole bar
has been turned into...

18:31.187 --> 18:33.237
- Jefferson Starships.
- Fine.

18:33.689 --> 18:35.709
But why are all the Starships dead?

18:36.158 --> 18:39.698
I can't say,
but it looks like they all burned up.

18:40.362 --> 18:43.822
- Burned up? Like...
- Like a high fever, like the flu.

18:44.467 --> 18:45.667
What's going on here?

18:46.001 --> 18:48.661
Does every monster in this town
have the Motaba virus?

18:49.205 --> 18:51.225
Hands where I can see them.

18:56.278 --> 18:58.528
- Now, this is not what it looks like.
- We're the feds.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.324
Yeah? Well, feds
are not allowed to do this.

19:02.952 --> 19:05.142
Cuff them. Turn around.

19:27.610 --> 19:30.040
If we can make a phone call,
we can straighten this all out.

19:30.546 --> 19:32.796
- Straighten out a massacre?
- I'd like to see you try.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.447
Jefferson Starships.

19:51.734 --> 19:52.994
Dean, wait.

19:55.838 --> 19:58.418
Well, I'll say this.

19:58.941 --> 20:02.131
You're the healthiest-looking specimen
I have seen all day.

20:02.745 --> 20:04.935
I take my vitamins.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.404
So you wanna tell us
what's going on here?

20:09.218 --> 20:10.118
Hm?

20:11.187 --> 20:14.757
So you boys
are Eve's cleaning crew? Is that it?

20:15.424 --> 20:18.264
You come around
to clean up the bodies...

20:18.928 --> 20:21.588
make sure the word
doesn't get out, huh?

20:22.164 --> 20:24.534
Is that why you snatched up
the doctor?

20:25.034 --> 20:26.874
You're so wasting your time.

20:27.303 --> 20:30.023
You stupid head of cattle.
Ha-ha-ha.

20:32.808 --> 20:34.388
More Starships.

20:35.044 --> 20:36.034
Stay here.

21:06.408 --> 21:07.458
You're Dr. Silver's boys.

21:09.245 --> 21:11.175
Don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

21:11.614 --> 21:13.284
- Uh... What, keys?
- Yeah.

21:14.717 --> 21:16.937
Look, we're not gonna hurt you.

21:17.786 --> 21:20.776
My name is Sam,
that's my brother Dean.

21:21.357 --> 21:23.907
Those cops,
they're not coming back, ever.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.640
What are your names?

21:33.335 --> 21:34.735
Joe. This is Ryan.

21:36.739 --> 21:38.169
Hi, Ryan. How you doing?

21:39.475 --> 21:42.435
He won't talk,
not since they came for us.

21:47.616 --> 21:50.426
All right, listen, Joe, we're gonna
get you out of those handcuffs. Uh...

21:51.654 --> 21:54.204
But you understand what's going on
around here, don't you?

21:54.757 --> 21:58.217
- So first we gotta make sure you're you.
- How you gonna do that?

21:58.861 --> 22:01.411
Well, there's a few dozen tests.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.677
Okay, let's get started.

22:10.539 --> 22:12.709
You really think
that's gonna make me talk?

22:13.175 --> 22:14.075
Something will.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.560
Got a couple
of hungry human boys here.

22:21.016 --> 22:22.686
Come on, guys.

22:27.056 --> 22:32.156
So you two never heard them talk
about a mother...

22:33.495 --> 22:34.865
or someone named Eve?

22:36.932 --> 22:38.892
It was just me and Ryan in there.

22:41.670 --> 22:43.310
And your folks?

22:43.806 --> 22:44.946
Cops said we were next.

22:46.875 --> 22:48.185
They said we were food.

22:50.579 --> 22:51.869
You have any other family?

22:52.214 --> 22:53.384
An uncle in Meritt.

22:53.716 --> 22:55.796
Meritt. What's that,
15 miles outside of town?

22:56.251 --> 22:58.831
- Okay, we'll get you there.
- Dean.

22:59.355 --> 23:00.905
Can I have a word?

23:03.726 --> 23:06.246
- We need to find Eve now.
- Yeah.

23:06.762 --> 23:08.542
Go. Me and Sam
just gotta make a milk run.

23:08.964 --> 23:10.104
We need your help here.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.482
Hold your water.
We'll be back in a few.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.865
Dean, Dean.

23:15.471 --> 23:18.191
Millions of lives are at stake here,
not just two.

23:18.741 --> 23:20.171
- Stay focused.
- Are you kidding?

23:20.542 --> 23:22.322
- There's a greater purpose.
- You know what?

23:22.745 --> 23:26.085
I'm getting a little sick and tired
of the greater purposes, okay?

23:26.715 --> 23:30.435
I think what I'd like to do right now is
save a couple of kids, if you don't mind.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.868
We'll catch up.

23:35.758 --> 23:38.598
Okay, guys, let's go. Come on.

24:02.918 --> 24:05.088
Hey, you should get some rest.

24:31.613 --> 24:33.423
They won't take long.

24:35.150 --> 24:36.900
You don't know that.

24:37.686 --> 24:40.556
They may find more wayward orphans
along the way.

24:41.123 --> 24:43.083
Oh, don't get cute.

24:44.693 --> 24:45.683
Right.

24:46.829 --> 24:49.019
Pardon me
for highlighting their crippling...

24:49.498 --> 24:52.538
and dangerous empathetic response
with "sarcasm."

24:59.241 --> 25:00.821
It was a bad idea, letting them go.

25:01.743 --> 25:03.033
Come on.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.838
You don't let Sam
and Dean Winchester do squat.

25:06.348 --> 25:07.958
They do what they gotta.
You know that.

25:09.451 --> 25:12.291
Anyway, we want Eve...

25:12.855 --> 25:14.085
we need coordinates.

25:14.456 --> 25:16.766
So we can stand here bellyaching...

25:17.259 --> 25:20.279
or we can go poke that pig
till he squeals.

25:21.063 --> 25:22.523
Thoughts?

26:03.205 --> 26:04.725
<i>You know, she can see you right now.</i>

26:06.241 --> 26:08.551
And you're just making her mad.

26:09.211 --> 26:11.491
Then tell the bitch to come get me.

26:12.014 --> 26:14.414
I need five minutes alone with him.

26:15.517 --> 26:17.037
What for?

26:19.955 --> 26:22.675
Cass, your batteries are dead.

26:25.227 --> 26:27.127
Give me five minutes.

26:28.130 --> 26:30.500
All right. Fine.

26:45.681 --> 26:48.401
Eve's at 25 Buckley Street.

26:50.419 --> 26:52.639
You can call Sam and Dean.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.739
Rigorous interrogation, huh?

27:09.195 --> 27:11.775
Well, we got a location.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.758
Now, we just gotta get close enough
to take a shot.

27:15.268 --> 27:16.318
All right.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.976
Well...

27:18.938 --> 27:20.838
let's all take one.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.440
Load them up. Make them count.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.800
You gotta be kidding me.
She's been in there the whole time?

27:40.326 --> 27:41.466
Why'd she ever let us in?

27:42.729 --> 27:43.719
Or out.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.460
- There's one way to find out.
- What, just stroll in?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.510
We don't know who's human
or who's her.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.871
Well, there's one way
to draw her out.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.177
- Me and Sam will go in.
- Dean.

27:56.609 --> 27:58.799
Look, we don't get a shot off,
you two better.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.646
- That's the plan?
- Yeah.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.319
Pretty much.

28:11.424 --> 28:14.324
Well, at least it ain't complicated.

28:30.510 --> 28:31.560
Now what?

28:32.578 --> 28:33.748
Crap.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.950
Crap. Crap.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.192
- Starships?
- Yeah.

28:38.651 --> 28:41.991
Is there anybody in this diner
that is not a flesh-eating monster?

28:42.655 --> 28:43.585
Uh, me and you.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.410
- Let's get out of here.
- Shall we?

28:45.792 --> 28:47.902
- Two specials, right?
- Uh, no, that's not for us.

28:48.361 --> 28:51.431
- We were just heading out.
- Now, that would be rude, Sam.

28:58.871 --> 28:59.801
Let me guess.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.307
- Eve.
- Pleasure.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.658
Why don't we step outside, chat?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.506
Why? This is private.

29:32.505 --> 29:36.285
Phoenix ash. I'm impressed.
I bet you had to go a long way for that.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.353
You have no idea.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.555
Destroy these. Thank you.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.619
Relax.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.031
I'm not here to fight.

29:46.352 --> 29:50.542
No, just to rally every freak
on the planet, bring in khan worms...

29:51.290 --> 29:53.950
and half-assed spider-men
and dragons.

29:54.494 --> 29:56.484
Really, sister? Dragons?

29:56.929 --> 29:59.619
So I dusted off some of the old classics.
I needed help.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.276
With what?

30:01.934 --> 30:03.574
Tearing apart the planet?

30:07.774 --> 30:09.264
You misunderstand me.

30:09.809 --> 30:13.149
I never wanted that, not at first.

30:13.780 --> 30:15.680
I liked our arrangement.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.305
- What arrangement?
- The natural order.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.638
My children turned a few of you.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.677
You hunted a few of them.
I was happy.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.740
Okay. So, what changed?

30:27.527 --> 30:29.607
My children, no thanks to you...

30:30.062 --> 30:33.632
started getting kidnapped
and tortured, even my firstborns.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.601
I was pushed into this.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.753
After all,
a mother defends her children.

30:39.172 --> 30:40.252
Really?

30:40.573 --> 30:44.003
You're gonna use
the mother-of-the-year defense? You?

30:44.777 --> 30:46.087
It happens to be true.

30:47.780 --> 30:49.270
Know what?

30:49.649 --> 30:53.049
Maybe you'll believe it
if I look a little more like this.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.395
Oh, you bitch.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.246
She died to protect you, didn't she?

31:04.163 --> 31:07.703
See? You understand a mother's love.
I'm no different.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.887
This conversation's over.
If you're gonna kill us, kill us.

31:11.804 --> 31:13.234
You?

31:13.606 --> 31:14.566
No.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.624
It's Crowley I want dead.

31:18.211 --> 31:19.851
Well, you're too late there.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.176
That little limey mook roasted
months ago.

31:24.317 --> 31:25.367
Crowley's alive.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.226
That's impossible.

31:29.755 --> 31:34.005
I see his face through the eyes
of every child he strings up and skins.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.191
Any idea why he's hurting my babies?

31:38.731 --> 31:41.391
He wants purgatory, right?
Location, location, location.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.065
Is that what he told you?

31:46.439 --> 31:47.989
It's about the souls.

31:48.374 --> 31:51.184
- What about them?
- They're power, you little monkey.

31:53.446 --> 31:54.646
Fuel.

31:54.981 --> 31:57.881
Each soul a beautiful,
little nuclear reactor.

31:58.451 --> 32:01.031
Put them together, you have the sun.

32:01.554 --> 32:07.184
Now, think what the king of hell could
do with that vast, untapped oil well.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.857
How powerful he'd be.

32:10.863 --> 32:15.963
Now, Crowley wants to siphon off my
supply and torture my children to do it?

32:17.637 --> 32:20.097
Okay, fine. I'll quit playing nice.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.444
I'll turn you all.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.836
Every soul, mine.

32:26.746 --> 32:30.146
Let's see how hot his hell burns
when everyone comes to me.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.024
He asked for it.

32:33.419 --> 32:36.789
You know, last I checked,
there are a few billion of us.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.653
That plan might take a while.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.935
What exactly do you think
I'm doing here?

32:43.129 --> 32:44.439
I'm building the perfect beast.

32:46.599 --> 32:47.769
Wait a second.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.710
All those...

32:50.403 --> 32:51.923
All those things we've been finding.

32:53.706 --> 32:54.696
Call it beta testing.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.810
Well, I think your formula
might be a little off.

33:00.313 --> 33:01.743
They're imploding all over town.

33:02.114 --> 33:05.244
Well, there were
a few unfortunate failures.

33:05.851 --> 33:07.691
But I eventually got it right.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.370
Quiet, smart, inconspicuous.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.071
It can spread through a whole town
in under a day.

33:14.527 --> 33:17.337
Oh, and the best part,
you've been with it the whole time.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.296
- What?
- Yes, you were the final test.

33:23.536 --> 33:27.406
I had to see if it could slip past hunters
undetected, of course.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.768
Little Ryan.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.529
Joe?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.783
Ryan?

34:14.116 --> 34:15.376
You look upset.

34:16.685 --> 34:20.844
If it makes you feel any better,
Ryan was bound to work on you...

34:21.590 --> 34:25.340
- little wayward orphan like yourselves.
- Unh.

34:26.261 --> 34:29.391
There's nothing you can do
about it now. So let's talk.

34:30.232 --> 34:31.402
Nothing to say.

34:31.733 --> 34:33.463
Well, that's where you're wrong.

34:34.168 --> 34:36.688
I have an offer to propose.

34:38.106 --> 34:41.706
Crowley, as you know,
not so easy to find.

34:42.377 --> 34:44.337
So here's the deal.

34:44.780 --> 34:48.290
You find him, bring him to me...

34:50.118 --> 34:51.668
I let you live.

34:54.089 --> 34:55.079
- Pass.
- Dean...

34:55.389 --> 34:58.000
Sam, no. The answer is no.

34:59.528 --> 35:01.308
You say that like you have
another option.

35:01.730 --> 35:04.220
- Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
- You think?

35:11.573 --> 35:14.093
Well, so much for your plan B.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.570
And you, wondering,
"Why so flaccid?"

35:21.083 --> 35:24.183
I'm older than you, Castiel.
I know what makes angels tick.

35:24.786 --> 35:29.176
As long as I'm around,
consider yourself unplugged.

35:32.294 --> 35:34.134
Work for me.

35:35.230 --> 35:37.340
It's a good deal.

35:40.535 --> 35:42.085
Bonus, I won't kill your friends.

35:42.471 --> 35:47.191
All right, look, the last few months,
we've been working for an evil dick.

35:48.043 --> 35:50.033
We're not about to sign up
for an evil bitch.

35:50.812 --> 35:54.352
We don't work with demons.
We don't work with monsters.

35:55.050 --> 35:57.570
And if that means you gotta kill us,
then kill us.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.720
Or I turn you...

36:01.556 --> 36:03.956
and you do what I want anyway.

36:07.162 --> 36:09.092
Beat me with a wire hanger,
answer's still no. Unh.

36:16.505 --> 36:17.465
Don't...

36:18.340 --> 36:20.070
test me.

36:22.344 --> 36:23.774
Bite me.

36:25.347 --> 36:26.657
- No.
- Dean.

36:33.388 --> 36:35.408
Phoenix ash.

36:36.525 --> 36:37.955
One shell.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.546
One ounce of whiskey,
down the hatch.

36:42.531 --> 36:44.551
Little musty on the afterburn.

36:46.635 --> 36:47.715
Call you later, Mom.

37:18.066 --> 37:19.026
Shut your eyes.

37:31.146 --> 37:33.896
We gotta take you
on more monster hunts.

37:34.683 --> 37:36.793
Hey, Cass, um...

37:37.419 --> 37:38.849
Dean's bleeding pretty good.

37:39.221 --> 37:41.331
I think she turned me
into a Jefferson Starship.

37:41.790 --> 37:43.690
Could you clear that up too?

37:48.230 --> 37:49.250
All right, we're good.

37:50.165 --> 37:51.125
We gotta go. Now.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.600
Where?

37:54.269 --> 37:55.289
The kid.

37:55.604 --> 37:58.414
- The little kid, he's one of them.
- Unbelievable.

37:58.974 --> 38:01.844
Yeah, I know, Cass.
You told me, all right? Let's just go.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.670
So we kill the wicked witch
and she still wins.

38:15.190 --> 38:18.700
I mean, they could've turned half
the town by now. Don't say it.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.087
Found them.

38:33.289 --> 38:34.490
Well, who ganked them?

38:40.730 --> 38:41.797
Demons.

38:55.688 --> 38:56.789
So, what do you think?

38:56.790 --> 38:59.892
I think that demons
don't give a crap

38:59.893 --> 39:03.892
about monster twins
unless they're told to.

39:04.397 --> 39:06.131
So, you think she was
telling the truth?

39:07.600 --> 39:08.534
The truth about what?

39:12.205 --> 39:13.439
She said that Crowley's
still kicking.

39:15.805 --> 39:18.439
But I burned his bones...
How ca...

39:19.412 --> 39:20.679
Was she certain?

39:20.713 --> 39:22.214
Sounded pretty sure.

39:22.282 --> 39:24.583
According to her,

39:24.684 --> 39:27.186
Crowley's still waterboarding
her kids somewhere.

39:27.287 --> 39:29.088
I don't understand.

39:29.189 --> 39:31.390
Well, he's a crafty
son of a bitch.

39:31.424 --> 39:33.592
I'm an angel.
I'll look into it immediately.

39:35.028 --> 39:36.495
Cass!

39:37.630 --> 39:39.331
Let us know what you find out!

39:42.202 --> 39:45.137
What? What?

39:47.040 --> 39:48.740
<i>How did Crowley get away?</i>

39:48.808 --> 39:52.311
I mean, it's not like Cass
to make mistakes like that,

39:52.412 --> 39:53.645
unless...

39:54.713 --> 39:55.514
Unless what?

39:55.615 --> 39:57.349
Unless he meant to.

40:00.553 --> 40:03.255
Bobby, this is Cass
we're talking about.

40:03.323 --> 40:05.357
<i>Do you believe this?</i>

40:09.928 --> 40:11.062
Sam?

40:12.132 --> 40:13.866
Look, it's probably nothing.

40:13.933 --> 40:15.234
It's just...

40:17.769 --> 40:20.672
You know what? You're right.
It's... it's probably nothing.

40:49.169 --> 40:51.403
Really, Cass...

40:51.471 --> 40:53.772
this is getting ridiculous.

40:56.476 --> 40:57.876
How many times

40:57.977 --> 41:00.879
am I gonna have
to clean up your messes?
