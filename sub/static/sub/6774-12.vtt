00:00.267 --> 00:02.534
 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.536 --> 00:04.837
    -You're going to get me
    the brain of alan york.
        -The astronaut?

00:04.839 --> 00:07.439
      Boss! They're gone.
      All my orders.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.775
       I wasn't crazy.
       These coolers are
       full of brains.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.276
     Zombies are real, liv.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.611
    I'm gonna kill them all.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.513
    It is like a cult
    over there at max rager.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.716
 It's this secret report that
 max rager had these seriously
    dangerous side effects.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.685
   Your product kills people
   and you know it.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.086
      The memo does exist.

00:21.088 --> 00:23.222
     It'll bring max rager
     to its knees.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.792
 Well, look who takes a lickin'
 and keeps on tickin'.

00:50.317 --> 00:53.652
 -(car playing loud rock music)
 -(brakes screeching)

00:59.960 --> 01:03.695
   Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
   Oh, my god. Oh, my god...

01:03.697 --> 01:07.099
    What the hell?
    He came out of nowhere!

01:07.101 --> 01:09.635
  Everything comes out of
  nowhere when your headlights
  are off, dumbass!

01:09.637 --> 01:12.204
     -Hey, man, you okay?
     -Does he look frickin'
     okay, nate?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.839
             Okay.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.642
    I kind of learned cpr
    at seeds of faith camp.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.445
   Somebody needs to do
   chest compressions to the
   beat of <i> all for the best</i>

01:19.447 --> 01:21.213
         From godspell.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.915
      Go check his pulse.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.051
     Yeah. Let me just rub
     my dna all over him.
         I think not.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.352
            (groans)

01:28.189 --> 01:29.788
        (clears throat)

01:31.592 --> 01:32.658
           (whimpers)

01:33.294 --> 01:34.359
            Mmm-mmm.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.944
       Son of a bitch...

01:51.946 --> 01:56.048
     (sobbing) oh, my god.
     We totally killed him.
     He's dead.

01:56.050 --> 01:58.217
    -No, it was an accident.
    -Yeah.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.385
     An accident
     in which someone died,
     cameron,

02:00.387 --> 02:04.189
   While we were stoned
   out of our minds
   and driving a stolen car.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.025
    I'm not going to prison.
    Have you seen
    <i> orange is the new black?</i>

02:07.027 --> 02:10.162
    I'm not taking a shower
    wearing tampon sandals.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.699
 What the hell are we gonna do?

02:23.577 --> 02:26.979
    We can never tell anyone
    about this.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.814
             Ever.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.482
      Not your therapist.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.284
        Not your priest.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.553
  Not your future na sponsor.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.888
            No one.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.757
    Tonight never happened.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.527
            Say it.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.562
  All: Tonight never happened.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.505
            Guys...

02:53.507 --> 02:57.342
    Shouldn't we put
    something on the grave?
    Like a little...

02:57.344 --> 02:59.378
      Cross made out of
      twigs or something?

02:59.380 --> 03:02.781
 How about a neon sign
 that says, "buried dead body."

03:02.783 --> 03:05.150
 We could leave our
 drivers licenses on it, idiot.

03:05.152 --> 03:08.687
       I'm not like you.
       I'm a good person.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.590
    (sobbing) and the only
    reason why i'm actually
       agreeing to this

03:11.592 --> 03:14.159
  Is because my dad just
  had his gallbladder removed

03:14.161 --> 03:16.662
     And there's no way
     he can handle
     the stress right now.

03:16.664 --> 03:21.166
  Nate, i don't care if she's
  the bang of the century.
  This chick has to go.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.469
         (all gasping)

03:24.471 --> 03:26.605
         -(screaming)
         -(neck cracks)

03:33.581 --> 03:34.980
           (cracking)

03:37.818 --> 03:39.351
         (dog barking)

03:46.927 --> 03:48.093
             Heel!

03:49.797 --> 03:51.063
             Rufus!

03:53.033 --> 03:54.433
             Rufus!

03:56.270 --> 03:57.336
        Come here, roof.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.537
           (clapping)

03:58.539 --> 03:59.805
             Rufus.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.983
      (theme song playing)

04:38.178 --> 04:39.244
     The late olivia moore.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.312
     Sorry. I got hung up.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.551
   So, multiple victims or
   victim in multiple pieces?

04:46.553 --> 04:50.255
    (sighs) the latter.
    We've already identified
    her as kimber cooper.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.425
   She was a cheerleader from
   doc maynard high school.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.927
     She went missing
     a couple of weeks ago.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.964
  She was supposed
  to attend a church lock-in,
  but never showed.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.432
       I heard about this
       missing girl.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.101
    She went to my old
    high school. My brother
    evan's a junior there.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.870
        Did he know her?

05:04.872 --> 05:07.139
 Only in the way that every boy
 knows the prettiest girl
 in high school.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.641
 So, from afar, yet intimately.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.946
    The first officers
    at the scene noticed
    a shallow grave nearby.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.482
   We were thinking an animal
   dug up her remains.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.151
     I wouldn't be so sure,
     look at that arm.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.920
  We'll know more when we
  get her back to the morgue.

05:21.922 --> 05:25.190
   All right,
   call me as soon as you've
   got something.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.229
      Her arm was severed
      perimortem.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.597
     And there's no dirt
     in her nose or mouth.

05:32.599 --> 05:35.200
    And you didn't feel like
    sharing that with clive
    because...

05:35.202 --> 05:38.403
   Not only was kimber's body
   ripped apart, her skull
   was cracked open.

05:38.405 --> 05:40.172
    It's missing a good deal
    of brain matter.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.773
    You think she was killed
    by a zombie?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.675
      It's a possibility.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.044
  I don't think
  i can take this anymore.
  This is way out of control.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.446
    We don't know for sure.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.482
  Let's do a thorough
  examination before we panic.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.818
  Major showed up
  at my apartment this morning

05:52.820 --> 05:55.287
    With five yellow coolers
    filled with brains.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.089
      He stole them out of
      the back of this car
         that was parked

05:57.091 --> 05:58.590
       Behind some place
       called meat cute.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.892
    It's like a butcher shop
    or something.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.361
    He thinks it's a zombie
    headquarters.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.364
 And he's more convinced
 than ever that zombies exist.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.633
   He basically pledged to me
   that he would kill
   every last one of them.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.168
     Well, i'm guessing you
     didn't tell him.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.304
  That he could start with me?

06:12.306 --> 06:16.975
  No. I toed the line between
  supportive and surprised,
  and i offered to help him.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.078
  I told him that i would test
  the brains. Make sure
  they weren't from an animal.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.514
  He swore that he wouldn't do
  anything until
  the results came back,

06:22.516 --> 06:24.015
   So that bought some time.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.352
     -And with that time...
     -I can try to come up
     with a plan.

06:27.354 --> 06:30.856
    I have to figure out how
    to kill blaine before
    anyone else gets hurt.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.325
   Before major puts himself
   in any more danger.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.394
            (sighs)

06:40.167 --> 06:42.334
   Why are you here and not
   carrying astronaut brains?

06:42.336 --> 06:45.537
   -I've... (clears throat)
   -i'm having a little
   trouble understanding you.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.173
      (hoarsely) i've been
      looking all night.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.442
     (sighs) i don't care.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.512
 I didn't kill a national hero
 for nothing.

06:53.514 --> 06:56.548
       Find those brains.

07:01.588 --> 07:05.357
 This is an incredibly
 bizarre thing to say out loud,

07:08.061 --> 07:10.262
  But if you're watching this,

07:11.265 --> 07:12.964
       I'm already dead.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.441
   I can see that kimber's
   shoulder was torn off
   while she was still alive,

07:22.443 --> 07:25.544
  But the rest of the torso...

07:25.546 --> 07:27.612
 It's hard to tell if her skin
 was ripped by a zombie

07:27.614 --> 07:31.216
  Or if it's just slipping off
  due to decomposition.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.284
           Poor girl.

07:34.555 --> 07:38.690
  This is weird, but
  i can't help thinking about
  alexa bechenbauer.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.592
 Prettiest girl in high school.

07:40.594 --> 07:44.596
 I took four years of german
 just so i could sit behind her
 and smell her hair.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.432
       (speaking german)

07:47.434 --> 07:49.534
     Can we not talk about
     high school right now?

07:49.536 --> 07:51.803
   It's hard not to feel like
   you've peaked,

07:51.805 --> 07:54.272
   When you're doing shots of
   two-week old liquefied

07:54.274 --> 07:57.509
   Prom queen brains in cold
   mexican hot chocolate.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.411
     I can only imagine how
     awful this must be.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.446
   Hopefully, you get an
   incredibly helpful vision.

08:01.448 --> 08:04.082
      We need to know
      if kimber's death
      was zombie-related.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.686
 I'm just worried that drinking
 cheerleader brains isn't
 the best course of action,

08:07.688 --> 08:11.590
    When i have to try
    to figure out how to rid
    seattle of blaine.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.492
   Unless i plan on
   cartwheeling him to death.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.093
    You're being judgmental.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.996
     Kimber could have been
     a very serious girl.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.432
              Ooh!

08:20.434 --> 08:21.766
 Hope's exercise wheel is here.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.835
      You named the cured
      zombie rat hope?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.837
     And bought her a toy.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.039
  Now that she's cured,
  i think it's important
  that we monitor how she goes

08:28.041 --> 08:30.942
      About her day-to-day
      activities.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.611
    And perhaps i was
    concerned she was bored.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.313
  Okay, but no rat soulcycle.

08:36.316 --> 08:40.652
 If you start lighting candles
 and blasting <i> work bitch,</i>
 i'm intervening.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.288
             Ravi?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.195
          Hope's dead.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.666
        How on the nose.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.401
       Liv, i'm so sorry.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.712
         It's not over.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.382
     Our supply of tainted
     utopium might be
     severely limited,

09:10.384 --> 09:12.717
      But there's enough
      for another attempt.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.819
   Then that's what we'll do.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.455
   If you want victory,
   do you know what the best
   thing to do is?

09:17.457 --> 09:19.958
    Try. Like, your hardest.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.160
    Okay. I mean,
    i was trying very hard.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.896
  The worse that things get,
  the more amazing it will be
   when we turn this around.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.164
       We can totally
       turn this around.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.066
       That's a very
       peppy perspective.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.601
      I'm a peppy person.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.970
   I think maybe cheer brain
   has kicked in already.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.039
       I'm fairly certain
       you've got spirit.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.107
           Yes. I do.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.944
   Hey, kimber's best friend,
   tate, is on her way in
   for questioning.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.445
     -Feel like sitting in?
     -Totes.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.322
              Liv!

09:50.324 --> 09:53.258
 Be aggressive. B-e aggressive.

09:55.662 --> 10:00.265
  Kimber was basically, like,
  a big ball of awesome.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.734
    I'm not even kidding.
    Like, she was the best.

10:02.736 --> 10:06.805
 The night kimber went missing,
 she was supposed to be
 at a youth ministry lock-in,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.473
     But she never showed.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.275
    Would you happen to know
    where she was?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.777
             -No.
             -Tate.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.147
   You totally know.
   You were her best friend.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.284
 Plus, you're like one of those
 girls everyone wants
 to spill their guts to.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.320
  I have known you for three
  seconds and i already
  want to tell you everything.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.389
            -Really?
            -Please.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.424
 I just had this,
 like, weird thing with an ex,

10:26.426 --> 10:28.860
   And i kinda wanna
   get froyo with you
   and tell you all about it.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.762
     I can cut next period.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.965
             Look,

10:33.967 --> 10:37.135
      I know that you want
      to protect kimber,
      but you can't.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.304
          She is dead.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.374
  But what you can do is help
  find her killer, and that is
  what best friends are for.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.075
            (sighs)

10:44.077 --> 10:46.845
 Okay. But you have to promise
 you won't judge.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.381
          I so won't.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.650
 The night kimber went missing,
 she left me a voicemail.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.753
   And i didn't play it
   for anyone because it made
   her sound bad.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.321
    If i play this for you,

10:56.323 --> 10:58.623
 You have to promise me
 that you will not tell anyone,
 okay?

10:58.625 --> 11:01.693
      Okay, but we kind of
      might tell people.

11:01.695 --> 11:05.530
  But only if we like really,
  really, really have to.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.399
    Whatever, but you cannot
    tell her dad.

11:07.401 --> 11:12.070
    Oh, i personally am not
    gonna tell her dad,
    but he may find out.

11:12.072 --> 11:16.675
   I just want you to have
   all the information,
   because you so deserve it.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.943
  I, like, so appreciate that.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.651
      (rock music playing)

11:27.988 --> 11:29.888
        Kimber: <i> Oh, sorry.</i>
       <i> It's loud here.</i>

11:29.890 --> 11:32.390
  <i> Taters. Omg.</i>
  <i> I bailed on youth ministry.</i>

11:32.392 --> 11:35.126
   <i> You've gotta cover for me.</i>
   <i> I'm seeing hottie mcbody,</i>

11:35.128 --> 11:40.031
  <i> And i'm thinking i may take</i>
  <i> that oral exam. I know.</i>
  <i> Cray. Okay. Love you muchly.</i>

11:40.934 --> 11:42.133
     Who is hottie mcbody?

11:42.135 --> 11:44.169
      That's this guy
      she started seeing.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.038
  She wouldn't even tell me
  his name. It was almost like
  a friendship-ender.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.339
      I'm not even lying.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.708
       What's that song
       in the background?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.810
        Slumber chunder.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.678
  It's like when you get
  really, really, really drunk
  and you puke in your sleep.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.181
    You know,
    that music sounded live.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.083
    Is there a bar
    she used to sneak into?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.652
       Kimber?
       There's no way
       she'd be at a bar.

12:00.654 --> 12:04.989
    If she had a fake id
    i would've totally seen
    the picture.

12:04.991 --> 12:08.793
 (scoffs) she probably would've
 had me curl her hair for it.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.929
  Aw. You are being so strong.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.502
            (sighs)

12:17.504 --> 12:19.337
   I feel really bad for her.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.940
  I kinda have a contact sad.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.875
  What's with you?
  Why are you acting so weird?

12:23.877 --> 12:26.778
     I was just trying
     to get inside the head
     of a teenager.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.246
      Don't be so method.

12:29.049 --> 12:32.183
       Uh, help yourself.

12:32.185 --> 12:36.921
  Oh, i'm googling. Relax.
  If they sing slumber chunder
  a thousand times,

12:36.923 --> 12:39.891
     I'm guessing that's
     the name of the song.

12:39.893 --> 12:43.161
     Here you go.
     The band is called...

12:43.163 --> 12:45.363
   The ass hats.
   I wonder if they go to...

12:45.365 --> 12:49.134
   Hey, taters!
   Do you know a band called
   the ass hats?

12:49.136 --> 12:51.936
   Oh, my god,
   they're so totally gross.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.905
 They're these burn-out losers
 from my high school.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.841
    Do you know
    where we can find them?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.676
      (rock music playing)

13:01.414 --> 13:03.181
       Hello, cleveland!

13:15.462 --> 13:17.028
            (groans)

13:18.231 --> 13:20.532
 I take it you're the ass hats.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.436
     I've got a couple
     of questions for you.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.771
           (exhales)

13:34.681 --> 13:36.514
   What was your relationship
   with kimber cooper?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.716
 Well, sometimes at cheer camp,
 we braid each other's hair

13:38.718 --> 13:40.819
   And talk about
   how many calories we ate.

13:40.821 --> 13:44.022
   What our drummer is trying
   to say is that we didn't
   exactly hang out

13:44.024 --> 13:46.257
  In the same social circles.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.393
   Yeah, i'm not the type
   who falls into the splits

13:48.395 --> 13:50.628
   Every time some jock gets
   a ball in the right place.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.997
  Um, cheerleading is a sport.
  Fyi.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.833
           -What?
           -(scoffs)

13:54.835 --> 13:57.068
 -So, you didn't hang out
 with kimber, but you knew her?
 -Everyone knew her.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.670
 Whether they wanted to or not.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.371
    Where were you the night
    she went missing?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.973
 -We were here all night,
 rehearsing.
 -We were rehearsing all night.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.875
  Here, all night rehearsing.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.346
    And what night was that?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.281
    The night kimber cooper
    went missing.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.549
           The date?

14:13.820 --> 14:17.722
  It was definitely a friday.
  Right?

14:17.724 --> 14:19.624
     So, you know you were
     rehearsing all night,

14:19.626 --> 14:21.659
    But you don't remember
    the exact night it was?

14:21.661 --> 14:26.464
  No. Look, sorry i can't
  account for the whereabouts
  of every cheerleader

14:26.466 --> 14:29.834
  -We went to school with.
  -'cause being snarky helps.

14:32.305 --> 14:36.241
  Stop screwing around.
  Turn the headlights back on.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.977
  That seat belt really
  makes your boobs pop, babe.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.079
            (gasps)

14:41.715 --> 14:43.514
      Will you chill out?

14:46.586 --> 14:49.387
 I didn't want to say this
 in front of all three of them,
 but i had a vision

14:49.389 --> 14:51.289
       Of kimber in a car
       with the band.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.592
 Not only was she friendly
 with them, but she was fooling
 around with nate.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.827
            Really?

14:55.829 --> 14:58.263
      High school girls
      make weird choices.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.201
  I'm gonna try to get a look
  at the security footage.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.238
    (major clearing throat)

15:07.240 --> 15:11.910
 I hate to interrupt
 a lovely lady while she
 replenishes the meats but, uh,

15:11.912 --> 15:13.778
     It's that time again.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.649
       Health inspection.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.150
      Are you expecting me
      to applaud?

15:22.389 --> 15:24.122
    Ooh! Safe by a whisker.

15:32.399 --> 15:36.601
     Can i ask how many
     employees are on site
     any particular day?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.569
    That's an odd question.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.342
   Not if i'm checking to
   make sure you have enough
   hand-washing stations.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.810
    Are you the proprietor?

15:45.812 --> 15:47.679
     It's a pop inspection.
     You know the drill.

15:47.681 --> 15:52.016
 I do. One inspection per year.
 And we just had ours, um,
 two months ago.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.751
  Oh, it's twice per year now.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.819
          New policy.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.287
              Huh!

15:56.289 --> 15:58.756
     And taking photographs
     of exit signs?
     More new policy?

16:02.028 --> 16:04.162
             Uh...

16:04.164 --> 16:06.798
   If you've got a problem
   with me thoroughly
   documenting my inspection,

16:06.800 --> 16:09.634
     Then i suggest you
     call tina at district.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.036
       You know how much
       she likes that.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.341
           After you.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.622
   Oh, my curling iron died.
   I'm using yours.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.091
     No problem whatsoever.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.760
  Your hair looks really cute.
  Want me to do the back?

16:35.762 --> 16:38.429
           -Uh, okay.
           -(giggles)

16:39.399 --> 16:42.000
      Today was so weird.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.302
     I helped interview
     this witness who goes
     to my old high school

16:44.304 --> 16:47.205
     And it totally sent me
     into a time warp.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.340
   Ugh, were you flooded with
   memories of barrett?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.442
   Your high school boyfriend
   who wrote you
   a three-page note

16:51.444 --> 16:53.745
 On why you should lose
 your virginity together? Hmm?

16:53.747 --> 16:57.348
   I love that you remember
   my stories about barrett.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.251
   I remember everything.
   I would so win
   the olivia moore game show

17:00.253 --> 17:01.753
          In a second.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.321
     Please. I would crush
     peyton charles trivia.

17:04.324 --> 17:08.159
     Okay.
     Who was my best friend
     in middle school?

17:08.161 --> 17:11.229
  Joanne potts,
  until she moved to colorado,
  and then you hung out

17:11.231 --> 17:13.998
   With the next door
   neighbor boy until
   puberty made things weird.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.299
       And his name was?

17:15.300 --> 17:17.068
      -Larry something...
      -Gable.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.137
            (grunts)

17:19.138 --> 17:23.340
  Very good. You know,
  it's kind of weird, but ravi
  reminds me of him a little.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.910
      They're both geeks,
      but confident.
      It's a nice mix.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.211
     How are things going?

17:27.213 --> 17:30.681
   With ravi?
   Should we talk about this?

17:30.683 --> 17:33.117
    Maybe just don't tell me
    about sex.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.586
     -Oh, cause that's like
     all we do.
     -Stop.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.788
           No, it is.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.222
      -Like all the time.
      -Ah!

17:38.224 --> 17:40.391
     -Banging and banging.
     -No, don't!

17:40.393 --> 17:41.626
        (both laughing)

17:41.628 --> 17:42.727
      Okay, what the hell
      is going on here?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.695
  We're like pre-pillow fight.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.998
 -And we're talking about boys.
 -I know, right?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.435
     You know, we haven't
     been blatantly girlie
     in a really long time.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.470
       (sighs) it's nice.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.475
    We should go
    to spin class this week.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.643
        Yeah, we should.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.048
     Oh, good. You're here.

18:04.050 --> 18:07.151
   So, i reviewed
   the security footage
   from the storage facility.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.120
 The night kimber went missing,

18:09.122 --> 18:12.490
    Nate's car was parked
    at the storage facility
    from 6:00 that night

18:12.492 --> 18:13.925
   To 7:00 the next morning.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.359
        So, the ass hats
        weren't lying?

18:15.361 --> 18:17.728
          Not so fast.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.364
    Five other cars came in
    that night.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.433
        And this one was
        reported stolen.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.535
       It was only there
       for a few minutes.

18:24.537 --> 18:28.172
  What if nate and the girls
  showed up in his car first,

18:28.174 --> 18:31.642
  Then cameron picked them up
  and they all left in the
  stolen vehicle?

18:31.644 --> 18:34.512
  You are so awesome at this.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.315
     Yeah, well,
     it's a working theory.

18:37.317 --> 18:41.586
   We'll take it back
   to the kids, lean on them,

18:41.588 --> 18:43.554
    See if anyone slips up.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.158
 There's no music, thankfully.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.472
          (liv gasps)

19:02.175 --> 19:04.542
             O-m-g.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.119
     Nate was in the car
     with kimber the night
     that she was killed.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.722
     Possibly by a zombie,
     and now nate is dead.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.458
    But apparently not
    by a zombie.
    His skull was caved in,

19:20.460 --> 19:22.527
  But from what i could tell,
  none of his brains
  were removed.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.830
    Why would a zombie
    leave behind
    perfectly edible brains?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.231
   Maybe he got interrupted?

19:27.233 --> 19:28.499
            Or she.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.001
     Girls can do anything.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.670
    Yes, please, let's be
    politically correct when
    speaking of zombies.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.273
      I'm just saying...
      Full-on zombie mode,

19:35.275 --> 19:37.808
 I could've pulled this
 skull apart like a pistachio.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.245
    We're not sure the first
    murderer was a zombie,
    but it looks like it.

19:41.247 --> 19:45.483
   The second murder appears
   to be related, but doesn't
   speak to zombie.

19:48.188 --> 19:51.322
   There seems to be one way
   to find out.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.124
    Liv: I'm going in again.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.697
              Oh.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.733
     I need more hot seeds.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.068
 Well, if you're having more...

20:04.070 --> 20:05.670
          (squeaking)

20:06.573 --> 20:07.972
           Hey, ravi!

20:10.510 --> 20:12.543
  You made another zombie rat.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.745
   It's not alive. Not alive!

20:14.747 --> 20:19.116
 (laughing) sorry. I am feeling
 pretty good about myself.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.285
       Step one complete.
       Now, to cure her.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.187
   Only this go around,
   i'll decrease the potency.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.289
   It was a little too strong
   the last time.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.357
         Clive: Hello?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.661
              Ooh!

20:30.663 --> 20:33.898
   What did i tell you about
   having a pizza party
   without me?

20:33.900 --> 20:34.966
           Liv: Wait.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.739
  Are there mushrooms on this?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.609
  Not a big fan of mushrooms.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.943
         The texture...

20:45.945 --> 20:48.879
  Don't worry. I'll finish it.

20:48.881 --> 20:52.516
      See, i like that.
      People are so weird
      about sharing food.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.552
 I'm glad you're not squeamish.

20:54.554 --> 20:59.056
     So, look what we found
     on nate's cell phone.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.525
      A text from kimber.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.996
  "need to talk." dollar sign.
  Dollar sign. Dollar sign.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.430
       And then she gives
       a phone number.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.499
   You say, "she,"
   but look at the timestamp.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.669
          Oh, my god.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.872
     This came in a week
     after kimber died.
     The killer sent this.

21:14.874 --> 21:18.542
 Nate called the number the day
 he got the message and had
 a three-minute conversation.

21:18.544 --> 21:21.212
   Of course,
   i called the number today,
   and it's a dead line.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.447
       Maybe nate owed
       the killer money?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.349
  And failed to pay up, so...

21:25.351 --> 21:26.817
        (clicks tongue)

21:26.819 --> 21:29.954
 Maybe. I was wondering if you
 had a time of death for nate?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.823
    Yes. Time of death
    approximately 8:30 p.M.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.626
              Hmm.

21:35.628 --> 21:39.330
 I just finished watching
 last night's security footage
 from the storage unit.

21:39.332 --> 21:43.968
  Cameron's car was caught on
  camera, high-tailing it
  out of there at 8:37.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.670
    Cameron just became
    our number one suspect.

21:47.540 --> 21:51.142
<i> Well, what i got here is a</i>
<i> shotgun. This is 12-gauge pump</i>
<i> action with a pistol grip.</i>

21:51.144 --> 21:52.476
      <i> This boy will take a</i>
      <i> zombie's head...</i>

21:52.478 --> 21:54.578
          -Hey.
         <i> -Clean off...</i>

21:54.580 --> 21:57.148
    Just checking in.
    Seeing how you're doing.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.418
     I'm great.
     Just, uh, doing great.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.386
       I wanted to run
       something by you.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.055
    Uh, it's a bit personal.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.057
    Feeling weird about it,
    but here goes.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.925
      -I'm a little scared
      right now.
      -Why?

22:07.927 --> 22:11.095
  I don't know, but i'm afraid
  this ends with me
  feeling for lumps

22:11.097 --> 22:12.863
    In a place i don't want
    to be feeling.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.299
   I mean, i'll do it
   if it's necessary, but...

22:15.301 --> 22:19.537
   No. Nothing lump related.
   It's more of
   a romantic nature.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.439
     Oh. Okay. Got it. Go.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.174
   Going away for the weekend
   with peyton.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.076
     -Was contemplating...
     -Gonna stop you.

22:25.078 --> 22:27.478
     Sex related questions
     might get weird.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.681
 Peyton's kind of like
 a sister to me, so just, uh...

22:30.683 --> 22:32.817
 Look, just don't get specific,
 you know?

22:32.819 --> 22:36.454
    General areas are okay,
    but i don't want to know
    any details.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.557
     What the hell kind of
     questions do people
     usually ask you?

22:39.559 --> 22:42.460
 Look, i'm going
 to san francisco with peyton.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.595
     She's a <i> vertigo</i> freak,

22:44.597 --> 22:46.931
   So we're doing a tour
   of all the places
   where they filmed <i> vertigo.</i>

22:46.933 --> 22:48.566
  Oh, all right. Well played.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.568
           Thank you.

22:50.570 --> 22:54.138
  I was entertaining the idea
  of wearing a retro
  jimmy stewart-esque suit,

22:54.140 --> 22:55.639
       But was worried
       it seemed less...

22:55.641 --> 22:56.707
          -Cool.
          -And more...

22:56.709 --> 22:58.242
     -Trying way too hard.
     -Yeah.

22:58.244 --> 23:01.979
    Oh, okay. How good
    do you look in the suit?

23:01.981 --> 23:03.314
       Pretty damn good.

23:03.316 --> 23:04.382
             Do it.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.817
          -Yeah?
          -Definitely.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.719
           Thank you.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.955
  Now, if you wouldn't mind
  feeling around the cobblers
  for a bit...

23:10.957 --> 23:15.326
  -Get the hell out of here.
  -See, why is that the first
   place your mind goes to?

23:20.967 --> 23:23.267
    <i> Be sure to get yourself</i>
    <i> something with plenty</i>
    <i> of stopping power.</i>

23:23.269 --> 23:26.971
   <i> Don't go less than</i>
   <i> a .40 caliber.</i>
   <i> That's what this is here.</i>

23:38.551 --> 23:40.718
    You look like an orphan
    about to ask me
    for more gruel.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.687
   -(hoarsely) look, boss...
   -Please, sir...

23:43.689 --> 23:45.756
   I've looked everywhere...

23:45.758 --> 23:49.093
   Can you monetize
   your excuses and sell them
   for a million dollars?

23:49.095 --> 23:52.029
   No? Great,
   then keep them to yourself

23:52.031 --> 23:54.932
     And get back out there
     and find me
     my astronaut brains.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.700
              Go!

23:56.702 --> 23:59.236
  I don't need this right now,
  you guys.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.238
        I'm under enough
        stress as it is.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.474
  Especially with the
  health inspector showing
  up twice in as many months.

24:03.476 --> 24:04.809
   The health inspector came
   back around?

24:04.811 --> 24:06.777
      Yeah, you should've
      seen this guy.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.013
  Came in here looking like
  a catalog model.
  Was trying to flirt with me.

24:09.015 --> 24:12.016
   Thinks i'm going to melt
   because he's got blue eyes
   and broad shoulders.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.517
     Did he have good hair?

24:13.519 --> 24:16.153
  What is this bizarre segue
  that's happening right now?

24:16.155 --> 24:18.622
  Can we maybe stay on point?

24:18.624 --> 24:21.892
   I want my brains.
   I want my million dollars.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.494
        Make it happen.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.941
  I knew you'd pick that one.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.478
   I'll need a handgun, too.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.746
      Something with real
      stopping power.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.161
    I'll take both of them.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.762
      And however many
      bullets you've got.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.574
    Any need for a grenade?

25:16.883 --> 25:18.649
      Hey. Ready for spin?

25:22.755 --> 25:25.055
      Um, is that a bong?

25:26.359 --> 25:27.525
         Are you high?

25:31.931 --> 25:35.833
    You must be. You must be
    high if you want to go
    to the cops with this.

25:35.835 --> 25:38.135
    Do you realize how much
    money this is?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.937
      Nate: They're gonna
      catch us, man!

25:39.939 --> 25:42.439
  You are never
  going to the cops with this.
  Do you understand?

25:42.441 --> 25:43.874
   It's not happening, nate.

25:44.544 --> 25:45.843
            (gasps)

25:47.046 --> 25:48.345
      Whoa, earth to liv.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.582
      Sorry for bogarting
      your apple...

25:51.584 --> 25:52.750
     You've got some weed,
     don't you?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.985
     Not since 2009, um...

25:54.987 --> 25:59.256
 I think i have a couple
 edible lollipops from a white
 elephant gift like a year ago.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.458
            -Sold.
            -Really?

26:01.460 --> 26:02.993
     Unless you want them?

26:03.529 --> 26:05.563
         No. I'm good.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.601
  So, i take it, uh,
  spin class is not happening?

26:10.603 --> 26:12.636
    Yeah. Sorry.
    Something just came up.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.138
             Okay.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.311
     It was like so much
     of everything at once,
     you know?

26:20.313 --> 26:23.914
    Like emotion and drama.
    Pointing of fingers.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.850
       And people needing
       to just chill.

26:26.852 --> 26:31.021
     I think you need to be
     a bit more clear.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.457
    What exactly did you see
    in the vision?

26:33.459 --> 26:36.627
 Nate was smoking a bong,
 doing his deal and he was all,

26:36.629 --> 26:39.897
   "the stress is too much."
   and cameron was all,
   "what's your damage?"

26:39.899 --> 26:41.265
         Or something.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.767
 And nate was saying that
 he wanted to go to the police

26:43.769 --> 26:45.536
  And tell them
  what had happened and stuff,

26:45.538 --> 26:48.639
      And cameron wigged.
      He was like,

26:48.641 --> 26:51.342
     "that wasn't the deal.
     You're not going
     to the police.

26:51.344 --> 26:54.745
    "think about the money."
    blah-blah-blah.
    It was super intense.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.380
           The money?

26:56.382 --> 26:58.349
  Girl: I need to talk to you.

26:59.585 --> 27:02.786
      Miss giovanni.
      Please, have a seat.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.123
          (snickering)

27:09.862 --> 27:11.729
 She's totally still standing.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.898
         Kimber's dead.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.635
         Nate is dead.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.737
       And i think
       i'm gonna be next.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.582
   So, you're telling me
   you and your friends stole
   a car, ran a man over,

27:31.584 --> 27:35.019
     Buried him, and then
     he climbed out of the
     grave, killed kimber,

27:35.021 --> 27:36.987
       And drove away
       in the stolen car?

27:36.989 --> 27:39.256
              Yes.

27:39.257 --> 27:41.524
And if there's anything
i learned from <i> i know what you</i>
<i> did last summer,</i> one and two,

27:41.527 --> 27:44.194
    It's that me and cameron
    are next on the killer's
          revenge list.

27:44.196 --> 27:47.798
     You saw <i> i know what you</i>
    <i> did last summer 2?</i>

27:47.800 --> 27:49.967
      There should be
      a third one called,

27:49.969 --> 27:51.769
   <i> "seriously,</i>
   <i> i'm so not ever forgetting</i>
   <i> what you did last summer."</i>

27:51.771 --> 27:54.672
    -(chuckling hesitantly)
    miss moore.
    -I'm kinda right.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.507
    I'm not dicking around.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.809
    Look, someone out there
    is waiting to murder me.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.878
 You guys have to do something.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.280
   I'm going to make
   arrangements to send
   an officer home with you.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.883
     In the meantime,
     i'd like you to work
     with a sketch artist.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.218
     See if we can identify
     this alleged killer.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.856
    Oh. No, no, no,
    no, no, no, no, no. No.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.725
          I know you.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.794
    Do you? Do you know me?

28:16.796 --> 28:19.963
 Do you recognize the slope
 of my alpine-snow-drift nose?

28:19.965 --> 28:21.031
            Kind of.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.333
     I'm sorry.
     I can't work with her.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.302
  She is bossy and relentless,

28:25.304 --> 28:27.371
   And she has
   an overly-developed sense
   of self-importance.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.972
            (laughs)

28:28.974 --> 28:31.442
     I am a graduate
     of the federal school
     of applied cartooning.

28:31.444 --> 28:33.377
      I am not here to be
      critiqued by you.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.678
             Okay.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.880
     We were just leaving.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.182
            Come on.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.756
           (sighing)

28:45.758 --> 28:47.624
   So, did you get anything?

28:47.626 --> 28:48.692
             What?

28:49.628 --> 28:51.228
     Oh, no. Like a vision?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.297
      Yes, like a vision.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.199
 I thought that's why you were
 spacing in and out like that.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.901
           No. Sorry.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.370
   You know, teresa could be
   lying to protect cameron,

29:00.372 --> 29:02.339
    But why come up
    with such a crazy story?

29:02.341 --> 29:05.909
     A dead man rising
     from the grave,
     tearing people apart?

29:05.911 --> 29:09.913
     Dead man rising
     from the grave,
     tearing people apart.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.248
       Pretty ridiculous.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.416
             Yeah.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.888
       Man on radio:
       <i> Feel the fear</i>
       <i> and do it anyway.</i>

29:17.890 --> 29:20.491
       <i> "truth number one,</i>

29:20.493 --> 29:24.394
<i> "fear will never go away</i>
<i> as long as i continue to grow.</i>

29:24.396 --> 29:26.563
       <i> "truth number two,</i>

29:26.565 --> 29:28.298
    <i> "the only way</i>
    <i> to get rid of the fear,</i>

29:28.300 --> 29:31.135
    <i> "if you want something,</i>
    <i> is to go out and do it."</i>

29:34.440 --> 29:36.240
           Oh, great.

29:39.445 --> 29:40.511
             There.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.149
    (sighs) good night.
    You were extremely easy.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.318
         To work with.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.221
     (cell phone vibrating)

30:43.843 --> 30:45.242
           (laughing)

30:45.244 --> 30:47.244
    (cartoon playing on tv)

30:52.284 --> 30:55.853
  Dude, the mouse on this show
  is such a ball-buster.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.721
      That poor cat, man.

30:57.723 --> 31:01.158
 (chuckling) there's just
 this thing with, like, cheese
 and, there's dynamite.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.528
      I mean, how do mouse
      get dynamite?

31:04.530 --> 31:07.698
      Excuse me, cheech.
      I'm afraid i've got
        some bad news.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.967
  Is there a way that you can
  not tell me?

31:09.969 --> 31:11.802
        This can't wait.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.104
            (sighs)

31:14.106 --> 31:17.274
   This is edna timmons, 91.
   Brutally murdered.

31:17.276 --> 31:20.911
   Not a single bit of brain
   left in her skull.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.779
            -No way.
            -Way.

31:22.781 --> 31:24.748
   The police think there
   might be a serial killer.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.683
     They've given the case
     to detective flynn.

31:26.685 --> 31:30.087
   Okay. All right.
   I need to get it together.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.291
 I can't stay on these brains.

31:34.293 --> 31:38.428
 I mean, you're telling me that
 we have another zombie murder
 and...

31:39.531 --> 31:41.698
 I'm just thinking about bacon.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.634
     I need to drink
     some more cheerleader.

31:43.636 --> 31:45.669
    Put some pep in my step.

32:02.154 --> 32:05.022
   I'm resisting
   the urge to yell,
   "chug. Chug. Chug. Chug."

32:05.024 --> 32:06.089
            (coughs)

32:06.091 --> 32:08.058
 That wasn't really resisting.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.527
  You almost made mexican hot
  cheerleader chocolate
  come out of my nose.

32:10.529 --> 32:11.595
             Sorry.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.463
     (cell phone vibrating)

32:24.944 --> 32:26.143
       What? What is it?

32:26.145 --> 32:27.678
 Kimber was killed by a zombie.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.747
           Sebastian.

32:30.749 --> 32:33.417
 The max rager
 enforcer who tried to kill me.

32:33.419 --> 32:37.721
     I must've infected him
     when we were fighting
     on the boat.

32:37.723 --> 32:41.491
     I did this.
     I made another zombie.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.014
             Hello.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.685
 Mmm. Whatever you're cooking,
 it smells good.

33:10.422 --> 33:13.357
   What time do you and ravi
   leave...

33:13.359 --> 33:14.791
          Oh, my god!

33:15.694 --> 33:17.294
            (gasps)

33:17.296 --> 33:20.864
  Chili stir-fry medulla
  with a little thyme au jus.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.467
       What do you think?

33:23.469 --> 33:25.836
  -I think you're a dead man.
  -(laughs)

33:26.705 --> 33:29.339
  Thank you, captain obvious.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.809
    Four different kinds of
    chili pepper on hand.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.278
      I really came to the
      right place.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.381
   I'm normally not that much
   of a cook, but...

33:37.383 --> 33:41.585
   I seemed to have picked up
   a few things from my
   aunt edna.

33:44.990 --> 33:47.357
      Guess what i had
      for lunch yesterday?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.359
    I'm thinking aunt edna.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.662
     That woman practically
     raised me!

33:52.664 --> 33:56.366
    (snickering) she thought
    i had potential!

33:56.368 --> 33:58.902
         So, yesterday,

33:58.904 --> 34:05.175
   She slices her head open
   on the freezer door
   and asks me to bandage it.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.779
      And i'm there,
      with the bandage...

34:11.083 --> 34:12.149
      And there's blood...

34:14.853 --> 34:19.255
    And i'm just so hungry.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.527
    I couldn't stop myself.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.462
             Funny.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.532
    I've never eaten anyone
    i didn't want to eat.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.400
      You did this to me!

34:32.204 --> 34:33.536
            (grunts)

34:49.987 --> 34:51.254
            (yelps)

34:56.328 --> 34:57.761
           (snarling)

35:03.702 --> 35:05.335
            (groans)

35:08.440 --> 35:09.873
          (screaming)

35:23.489 --> 35:24.955
          Peyton: Liv.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.692
     (gasping and panting)

35:34.233 --> 35:35.465
             Don't!

35:41.106 --> 35:42.272
         What are you?

35:43.408 --> 35:44.608
             I'm...

35:44.610 --> 35:47.043
    You're barely bleeding.
    How are you not dead?

35:47.713 --> 35:49.679
    I'm not gonna hurt you.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.249
    I would never hurt you.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.952
  (stammering) you killed him.

35:55.954 --> 36:00.457
     You stabbed him
     through the head.
     And your eyes. What...

36:00.459 --> 36:02.125
  What happened to your eyes?

36:03.061 --> 36:04.628
  I'm just going to tell you.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.098
          I'm just...

36:08.100 --> 36:12.002
    I'm going to tell you
    and trust that you know
    i am still me.

36:15.340 --> 36:19.543
  The night of the boat party,
  i got scratched.

36:21.480 --> 36:25.982
   And that's why i broke up
   with major and it's...

36:27.786 --> 36:30.887
 Why i got a job at the morgue,

36:32.157 --> 36:33.990
  So that i could get brains.

36:36.094 --> 36:39.162
  Because that is what i have
  to eat to stay me.

36:40.432 --> 36:40.730
     Or this version of me.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.204
     There are zombies
     in the world, peyton.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.373
      And i'm one of them.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.646
      I'm gonna to get you
      some peroxide.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.243
            Peyton?

37:37.556 --> 37:39.022
          (ravi sighs)

37:43.929 --> 37:46.429
  He matches teresa's sketch.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.866
   He killed kimber and nate.
   His aunt.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.035
  He tried to kill you twice.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.907
    You did the right thing.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.543
    Do not feel any remorse.

38:00.545 --> 38:04.281
   If that was your body
   we were zipping up,
   that would be the tragedy.

38:07.019 --> 38:09.452
 I'll go call teresa's detail.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.721
 Let them know we got our guy.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.125
          (ravi sighs)

38:18.196 --> 38:19.529
           You okay?

38:20.932 --> 38:22.232
        Peyton was here.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.501
             What?

38:24.503 --> 38:26.303
     I told her everything.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.041
 She saw me go full-on zombie.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.345
   She saw me kill sebastian.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.216
 She looked at me like i was...

38:44.122 --> 38:46.923
     She got out of here
     as fast as she could.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.162
   We're supposed to leave
   for san francisco tonight.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.697
   I'll call when i find her.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.501
      Everything is going
      to work itself out.

38:58.503 --> 38:59.769
         She loves you.

39:30.102 --> 39:31.401
            Cameron?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.235
  I got something to show you,
  boss.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.404
   It better be the recovered
   brains of alan york.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.038
        Next best thing.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.614
  Well, what do we have here?

40:17.616 --> 40:21.951
   This is the guy that broke
   into my car and was asking
      around about brains.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.454
   The guy that was snooping
   around the skate park.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.790
  The guy who knows too much.

40:26.792 --> 40:30.960
 I guarantee this is the guy
 who took our astronaut brains.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.562
   So far, he isn't talking.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.399
            So far.

40:40.439 --> 40:44.007
    If you'll excuse me
    for a moment, inspector.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.117
   Hey, uh, my mom picked
   this application up for me
   a couple weeks ago.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.187
     Wondering if you guys
     were still hiring.

40:57.189 --> 40:59.322
     Now's not a good time.

40:59.324 --> 41:04.494
  Okay. Can i just leave this
  here with you then, so i can
  tell my mom that i did?

41:04.496 --> 41:05.562
        (sighs) why not?

41:05.564 --> 41:06.830
            Thanks.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.100
    Your emergency contact.

41:11.703 --> 41:12.769
         Olivia moore.

41:14.639 --> 41:17.273
 Is that the same olivia moore
 that works at the morgue?

41:17.275 --> 41:19.342
  Yeah. Yeah, she's my sister.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.111
         -You know her?
         -Not well.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.314
    You know what?
    Now that i think of it,

41:24.316 --> 41:27.484
       I have a position
       open that you'd be
       just perfect for.

41:27.486 --> 41:29.552
       How soon would you
       be able to start?

41:34.192 --> 41:35.558
           (panting)

41:41.666 --> 41:43.466
      (dial tone ringing)

41:54.246 --> 41:55.879
        (phone ringing)

41:55.881 --> 41:58.848
      Operator: <i> 9-1-1,</i>
     <i> what's your emergency?</i>

41:58.850 --> 42:00.083
             <i> Hello?</i>

42:00.752 --> 42:01.918
             <i> Hello?</i>
