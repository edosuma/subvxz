00:00.564 --> 00:01.778
Welcome to Tampa,

00:01.898 --> 00:04.886
land of money, cunny, and
where it's always sunny.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.323
You're interested in heroin.

00:06.443 --> 00:08.007
As a commodity, yes.

00:08.127 --> 00:10.607
This is a business with
which you are familiar?

00:10.727 --> 00:11.908
One of many.

00:12.757 --> 00:13.933
I know you.

00:14.168 --> 00:16.062
So how come we don't
talk anymore?

00:16.183 --> 00:18.342
Mr. O'Banion hopes very much

00:18.589 --> 00:20.559
Cicero becomes
your new home.

00:20.679 --> 00:21.941
And where does that
leave him?

00:22.061 --> 00:23.812
It leaves him
in Chicago.

00:23.932 --> 00:25.556
anything I ask you to do,

00:25.778 --> 00:27.881
you do not discuss it
with anyone.

00:27.926 --> 00:29.733
I never have
and never will.

00:29.853 --> 00:31.931
<i>Enoch Thompson.</i>
You know of him

00:32.051 --> 00:33.065
or you know him?

00:33.185 --> 00:35.710
- Who are you?
- The Bureau of Investigation.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.418
Mr. White,

00:37.538 --> 00:39.300
may I present Miss Daughter Maitland.

00:39.420 --> 00:40.889
Pleased to meet you.

00:41.009 --> 00:42.524
Ready to get rich?

00:42.644 --> 00:44.183
This land is worthless.

00:44.303 --> 00:46.152
You'll have to find
yourselves a new partner.

00:46.272 --> 00:47.413
You told me he was in.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.766
I'm here on new business.

00:50.012 --> 00:53.668
- Where you going, friend?
- As far as you'd like me to take you.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.699
- Henry, cut it out.
- Easy, Henry.

00:55.819 --> 00:57.860
Mind your business, Thompson.

01:00.403 --> 01:02.387
Well, go on, Romeo. Don't let us interrupt.

01:02.507 --> 01:05.120
Enough money and the right connections,

01:05.239 --> 01:07.190
you can do pretty much anything down here.

01:07.310 --> 01:11.137
I've reconsidered. Tell your hillbilly
friend Tucker I'm in.

03:30.105 --> 03:31.706
It's Jake Guzik.

03:34.210 --> 03:37.345
Set your watch by the Capones.

03:37.446 --> 03:39.948
20, right on time.
Here you go.

03:40.049 --> 03:42.750
The... vig...

03:42.852 --> 03:46.119
- <i>comes... to...</i>
<i>- 25, yeah. Yeah.</i>

03:46.221 --> 03:49.122
You break a saw?

04:00.501 --> 04:02.534
Enoch "Nucky" Thompson.

04:02.635 --> 04:05.137
Former treasurer
of Atlantic City.

04:05.239 --> 04:07.673
His brother Eli,
Nucky's number two,

04:07.774 --> 04:10.243
also the former sheriff
until he went to jail.

04:12.079 --> 04:14.180
Michael "Mickey" Doyle,
nee Kuzik,

04:14.281 --> 04:16.249
runs Thompson's
liquor operations.

04:16.350 --> 04:17.949
At least partly.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.885
Laszlo "Lolly" Steinman
is in charge

04:19.986 --> 04:22.019
of the racing wire
and other gambling.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.955
Nucky? Mickey? Lolly?

04:24.056 --> 04:26.424
Where's Flopsy and Mopsy?

04:26.525 --> 04:28.726
These men are murderers,
gentlemen.

04:28.827 --> 04:30.228
Yes, sir.

04:30.329 --> 04:32.563
This details
one local operation.

04:32.664 --> 04:35.465
A criminal enterprise with ties
to others throughout the country.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.902
You're proposing there's
a nationwide conspiracy?

04:38.003 --> 04:39.904
It's all right here, Edgar.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.911
These cities are almost wholly
run by criminal overlords,

04:47.012 --> 04:49.113
each with ties to one another.

04:49.214 --> 04:51.414
Waxey Gordon in Philadelphia.

04:51.515 --> 04:53.883
King Solomon in Boston.

04:53.984 --> 04:56.119
<i>John Torrio in Chicago.</i>

04:57.721 --> 04:59.222
Within the last month,

04:59.323 --> 05:01.791
Nucky Thompson was visited
by Arnold Rothstein

05:01.892 --> 05:04.027
<i>and Joe Masseria</i>
<i>down from New York City.</i>

05:04.128 --> 05:06.995
Our op in Chicago places
Torrio in Atlantic City

05:07.096 --> 05:08.596
on November 6, last.

05:08.697 --> 05:11.433
- Our op?
- Agent, sir.

05:11.534 --> 05:12.935
So?

05:13.036 --> 05:15.137
Criminals have friends
like everyone else.

05:15.139 --> 05:17.572
Until you can prove
conspiracy, you have nothing.

05:17.673 --> 05:19.341
You want proof?
I'll get it.

05:19.442 --> 05:21.076
How do you propose to do that?

05:22.644 --> 05:25.679
I'll find the weakest link
in Thompson's chain

05:25.780 --> 05:28.182
and I'll break it.

05:29.751 --> 05:32.153
I'll take a ham sandwich
and a beer.

05:35.023 --> 05:37.224
Get me more Mecca for my neck.

05:40.094 --> 05:42.128
I'm still peeling
from the sunburn.

05:42.229 --> 05:45.432
I will have Tom do it
as soon as he returns.

05:45.532 --> 05:47.467
Are your legs broken?

05:47.568 --> 05:49.936
I have business to attend to.

05:50.037 --> 05:52.705
Three deposits
before the banks close.

05:52.806 --> 05:55.540
Right. Right.
Where's Tom?

05:55.641 --> 05:59.011
He's on his way back with
Mr. Rothstein from the train station.

06:01.581 --> 06:03.615
Make sure you--

06:03.716 --> 06:05.817
make sure Tom gets
milk and cake.

06:05.918 --> 06:07.752
Whatever Rothstein needs.

06:07.854 --> 06:10.054
I want him receptive
to this offer.

06:12.291 --> 06:13.858
I thought you were in a hurry.

06:13.959 --> 06:17.195
Ahem, the deposits
while you were in Tampa.

06:17.296 --> 06:20.198
For you to confirm
the dates and balances.

06:20.299 --> 06:21.832
You have my every confidence.

06:27.205 --> 06:29.406
<i>Wait.</i>

06:31.609 --> 06:34.677
From the Chelsea branch,
take out $10,000

06:34.778 --> 06:36.946
and meet the Broadway
Limited at 5:20.

06:37.048 --> 06:40.217
- And then?
- Hop aboard. See the world.

06:42.119 --> 06:44.353
Don't they have
jokes in Germany?

06:46.656 --> 06:49.791
Put a white carnation
in your right lapel.

06:49.893 --> 06:51.527
White, not red.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.295
A man will approach you.

06:53.397 --> 06:55.931
Ask if you have a package
for Mr. Brown.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.866
Give him the cash and only him.

06:58.967 --> 07:01.702
5:20, Mr. Brown.

07:01.803 --> 07:03.471
Can you handle this?

07:05.408 --> 07:08.176
I will protect it with my life.

07:08.277 --> 07:10.611
Don't be so dramatic.
It's only money.

Miss Maitland.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.963
Enjoying the show so far?

08:06.064 --> 08:08.665
Your man there can play.

08:10.502 --> 08:13.304
Last I checked, there was a
singer up there with him.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.440
Got no complaints.

08:17.509 --> 08:20.042
No compliments, either.

08:21.445 --> 08:24.481
You just go on singing

08:24.582 --> 08:26.949
to the folks need to hear you.

08:38.794 --> 08:40.294
I've been waiting
to talk to you.

08:52.774 --> 08:55.876
It's my mama.
She's sick.

08:55.977 --> 08:57.578
Sorry to hear that.

08:57.679 --> 08:59.247
May be pertussis
or consumption.

08:59.348 --> 09:02.517
Can't say,
but she asking for me.

09:02.618 --> 09:04.552
You got somebody
to make your collects?

09:04.653 --> 09:06.053
My boys up on it.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.321
Be back from Baltimore
in two days.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.257
If it's all right with you.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.600
You got family to tend to,
go and tend to them.

09:35.048 --> 09:37.816
Eat that, Wyatt Earp.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.917
Set me up again, Mueller.

09:43.189 --> 09:45.356
Five spot says it takes
you both barrels.

09:45.457 --> 09:47.158
Oh, I'll take your money.

09:47.259 --> 09:50.661
I bagged four Filthy-pinos,
summer of aught-one.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.697
Oh, that so?

09:59.104 --> 10:00.437
Ah, fuck!
I'm shot!

10:00.538 --> 10:02.206
Did you-- did you--

10:02.307 --> 10:05.008
- The fuck?
- "I bagged four Filthy-pinos," he says.

10:05.109 --> 10:06.743
I can't see.
I'm blind.

10:06.844 --> 10:09.779
Oh, I'm gonna piss myself.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.547
Mueller, help him up there.

10:12.817 --> 10:14.617
- Jesus Christ, Deano.
- It's a little dirt.

10:14.719 --> 10:16.686
- It was just a gag.
- I could have lost a fucking eye.

10:16.787 --> 10:19.855
I said it was a gag.
You want me getting sore?

10:20.957 --> 10:22.758
No. Sure, yeah.
What you said.

10:22.859 --> 10:25.861
I missed it?
God damn it.

10:27.630 --> 10:29.631
Delivery down St. Luke's.

10:29.733 --> 10:31.566
- One of the Capones.
- Al or Frank?

10:31.667 --> 10:33.435
That bloater
makes their collections.

10:33.536 --> 10:35.770
- Bad ticker.
- Shame.

10:35.871 --> 10:38.539
Like to make a nice wreath
for one of them guineas.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.242
I'm gonna maybe go
lay down in the truck.

10:41.343 --> 10:43.544
Hey, get that beer
over to Schultzie's first.

10:47.015 --> 10:50.084
George,
toss some daisies together.

10:50.185 --> 10:52.619
The day-olds.
Hoof 'em up to the hospital.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.289
Honestly, I'd prefer
to avoid the Capones.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.726
Last time I got this.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.684
They don't soak in, you know.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.720
- I'm awake.
- You actually have to read them.

11:32.424 --> 11:34.425
Thank your mother.

11:40.498 --> 11:44.034
"Tess of the De-erber"?

11:44.135 --> 11:46.503
Beats me.

11:46.604 --> 11:49.372
200 bucks a semester, beats me?

11:55.680 --> 11:58.747
Your mother said you've been walking
around with your bottom lip on the floor.

11:58.849 --> 12:00.449
What gives?

12:00.550 --> 12:02.418
- Nothing.
- Bull.

12:02.519 --> 12:05.021
- Grades?
- They're okay.

12:05.122 --> 12:07.957
- One letter home I find out.
- They're okay.

12:08.058 --> 12:09.892
Good at chemistry.

12:09.993 --> 12:12.794
What, then?
A girl?

12:16.232 --> 12:18.033
I'm just not happy there, okay?

12:18.134 --> 12:20.368
Happy?

12:20.469 --> 12:22.637
You're there to get
an education.

12:22.738 --> 12:24.539
You think I'm happy?

12:24.640 --> 12:28.542
It's just these kids are
a bunch of stuck-up jerks.

12:28.643 --> 12:30.911
You're a Thompson.

12:31.012 --> 12:32.446
Who are they?

12:32.547 --> 12:34.849
Philadelphia mostly.
New York.

12:34.950 --> 12:38.953
Met one other kid from Atlantic
City and he dropped out.

12:39.054 --> 12:41.989
Yeah, well, you're the only
boy from Atlantic City

12:42.090 --> 12:44.257
anybody needs to know.

12:44.358 --> 12:46.525
Remember that.

12:46.626 --> 12:48.928
<i>You're there to make</i>
<i>something of yourself.</i>

12:49.029 --> 12:50.763
For your mother.

12:50.865 --> 12:53.066
I'm trying, okay?

12:53.167 --> 12:55.168
Try harder.

12:55.269 --> 12:57.703
I don't want to hear
this nonsense again.

13:04.744 --> 13:06.711
You got broad shoulders.

13:06.812 --> 13:09.581
Remember why you're there

13:09.682 --> 13:11.984
and do what you have to do.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.262
They call this food?

13:24.363 --> 13:27.198
- I'm hungry.
- You're always fucking hungry.

13:27.299 --> 13:29.533
This shit will kill you
soon as a bullet.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.502
Just some ricotta
and white sauce

13:31.603 --> 13:33.136
to settle your stomach, huh?

13:33.237 --> 13:35.138
Thanks, fellas.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.246
Next time, tell that lazy bastard to
come down the street to pay you, huh?

13:43.347 --> 13:44.614
I'll be out in a week.

13:44.715 --> 13:46.917
I only missed three pickups.

13:47.018 --> 13:49.184
You get your strength back.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.486
I'm gonna slip
one of these nurses a fin.

13:51.587 --> 13:53.488
Get you a nice
little sponge bath.

13:53.589 --> 13:54.990
Make it a couple of nurses.

13:55.091 --> 13:58.294
There's a lot of Jake to sponge down.

14:00.463 --> 14:02.531
When was the last time
we did a pickup?

14:02.632 --> 14:04.399
Me and you?

14:04.499 --> 14:06.000
Brooklyn.

14:06.101 --> 14:09.237
Frankie Yale, back when
we was Five Points.

14:09.338 --> 14:11.139
That guy with the wooden teeth.

14:12.741 --> 14:15.310
I still got fucking splinters.

14:17.246 --> 14:20.480
So how about it, huh?
You and me.

14:20.581 --> 14:22.482
We finish Jake's collections.

14:22.583 --> 14:25.218
Sure.
Why not?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.020
Oh!

14:27.121 --> 14:29.256
<i>Who sent for the undertaker?</i>

14:29.357 --> 14:32.025
Hello.
These are the flowers you ordered.

14:32.126 --> 14:34.061
What?
This is the shit he sends?

14:35.563 --> 14:37.964
I got weeds under my porch
nicer than these.

14:42.402 --> 14:44.070
See that?
They don't even stand up.

14:44.171 --> 14:46.305
Mr. O'Banion meant
no disrespect.

14:46.406 --> 14:49.708
The man's sick. How else is
he supposed to take it, huh?

14:49.809 --> 14:51.577
If you'd prefer
some begonias...

14:51.678 --> 14:55.380
See? This is what your soft-soap
gets us with O'Banion.

14:58.017 --> 14:59.084
How's the melon?

14:59.185 --> 15:01.786
I suppose it could
have been worse.

15:01.887 --> 15:04.922
Yeah, you're right.
Could have been me.

15:05.024 --> 15:07.925
So, Deano, he misses us?

15:09.160 --> 15:12.129
You know Mr. O'Banion.
Always jocular.

15:13.698 --> 15:15.366
I heard he opened
two new speaks

15:15.467 --> 15:18.002
down on the Gold Coast.

15:18.103 --> 15:20.004
Hmm.

15:20.105 --> 15:23.007
Well, I'm sure Mr. Guzik
needs his rest.

15:23.108 --> 15:25.441
Hey, where you going?
We're talking.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.276
Mr. O'Banion is waiting.

15:30.981 --> 15:33.016
He can wait.

15:34.418 --> 15:36.552
Huh?

15:41.391 --> 15:42.524
See? Watch.

15:47.830 --> 15:51.266
14,000 acres,
70 bucks per.

15:52.935 --> 15:56.203
It's my understanding that Florida
real estate is played out.

15:56.304 --> 15:59.240
Except we're not buying land,
we're buying opportunity.

15:59.341 --> 16:01.175
Think Frisco in '48.

16:01.276 --> 16:04.311
Gold, Nucky?

16:04.413 --> 16:07.148
Better. We've got
water on three sides

16:07.249 --> 16:09.283
half a mile from the
Atlantic Coast rail line.

16:09.384 --> 16:11.618
A trawler can reach
the Bahamas in 22 hours.

16:11.719 --> 16:13.854
- Havana in 28.
- Rum.

16:13.955 --> 16:16.122
<i>The best in the world,
straight from the islands.</i>

16:16.223 --> 16:19.760
McCoy and the boats take it straight
up the coast to port in Atlantic City.

16:19.861 --> 16:22.763
- Or New York.
- And reload with our whiskey.

16:22.864 --> 16:25.899
A spirit in tragically
short supply down there.

16:28.302 --> 16:30.670
- Competition?
- <i>None of any consequence.</i>

16:30.771 --> 16:32.838
As long as we act now,
plant our flag.

16:32.940 --> 16:36.341
Time those hayseeds figure out what
we're working, we'll be in clover.

16:36.443 --> 16:38.744
And our friends
a bit closer to home?

16:38.845 --> 16:40.846
Masseria won't go
past Brooklyn.

16:51.657 --> 16:54.425
What I require is a partner
with a level head.

16:55.828 --> 16:58.863
Not to mention
a half million dollars.

16:58.965 --> 17:01.765
I'm assuming
at least as much risk,

17:01.866 --> 17:03.533
which I generally
choose to avoid.

17:06.972 --> 17:09.740
Who to believe--
the Nucky who told me

17:09.840 --> 17:12.776
only weeks ago he was
satisfied with what he had,

17:12.877 --> 17:16.246
or the Nucky who stands
before me now?

17:16.347 --> 17:18.547
Circumstances change, Arnold.

17:18.648 --> 17:20.116
People change.

17:20.217 --> 17:21.751
Do they?

17:23.185 --> 17:25.922
Last year took a toll
on both of us.

17:26.022 --> 17:28.625
You can wallow in the past
or you can come aboard

17:28.726 --> 17:30.927
and do historically what
we've been pretty good at--

17:31.028 --> 17:32.328
making money.

17:34.030 --> 17:36.798
A pity you left office.

17:36.899 --> 17:39.501
How soon do you need
a decision?

17:39.602 --> 17:42.137
Take the evening.

17:42.238 --> 17:45.741
I'll mull it downstairs
over poker.

17:45.842 --> 17:47.743
I trust you'll join me?

17:47.844 --> 17:50.244
- Later on, perhaps.
- <i>Good.</i>

17:50.345 --> 17:53.447
I find you don't
really know a man

17:53.548 --> 17:55.516
until you play cards with him.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.718
Don't we know
each other, Arnold?

17:57.819 --> 18:00.021
One would have thought so.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.771
Sure you want to trust him?

18:19.306 --> 18:21.807
You know anyone else
with that kind of money?

18:23.109 --> 18:25.477
<i>Beautiful office.</i>

18:25.578 --> 18:28.547
<i>I myself find
it rather ostentatious.</i>

18:28.648 --> 18:30.783
<i>It belongs to Mr. Garvey,</i>

18:30.884 --> 18:33.451
<i>who at the moment</i>
<i>is fighting deportation.</i>

18:33.553 --> 18:35.854
What he do?

18:35.955 --> 18:39.090
He founded this organization.

18:39.191 --> 18:41.893
Am I to assume by your
presence, Mr. Purnsley,

18:41.994 --> 18:44.528
that you are a Negro
in need of improvement?

18:55.306 --> 18:57.808
You are far from home.

18:59.677 --> 19:03.113
From your broad features,
Senegambia

19:03.214 --> 19:04.848
or Loango.

19:04.949 --> 19:07.784
That there green is from
the powder I sell for you.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.885
We agreed I would see you
in Atlantic City.

19:09.986 --> 19:11.387
Well, I thought I'd just--

19:11.488 --> 19:13.089
Ignore my explicit instruction?

19:13.190 --> 19:15.925
- No, sir. I just--
- You are standing in the offices

19:16.026 --> 19:20.096
of the Universal Negro Improvement
Association, Mr. Purnsley.

19:20.197 --> 19:23.099
This is not that.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.834
This is something else.

19:27.136 --> 19:28.737
- Mr. Narcisse--
- Doctor.

19:35.077 --> 19:37.346
I just wanted to let you know,

19:37.447 --> 19:39.748
Doctor, that I could--

19:39.849 --> 19:41.782
It's a shame you wasted
your trip, Mr. Purnsley.

19:41.883 --> 19:44.485
- But listen.
- Miss Walker will show you out.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.619
Should take out an ad,
That's for me.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.156
Oh, for Christ--

20:25.257 --> 20:28.025
You got a package
for Mr. Brown?

20:30.128 --> 20:31.763
You new?

20:31.863 --> 20:33.798
'Cause it's usually
a different guy.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.767
I have been integral to
Mr. Thompson's organization

20:36.867 --> 20:38.268
for quite some time.

20:38.369 --> 20:39.903
Good day to you.

20:40.004 --> 20:41.838
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Is there a place

20:41.939 --> 20:44.541
besides this shithole outside
the station I could eat?

20:44.642 --> 20:46.410
What type of fare?

20:46.511 --> 20:48.812
Steak, some spuds.

20:48.913 --> 20:51.715
The Knife & Fork
does an excellent chop.

20:51.816 --> 20:54.583
Where is that?
I got a train back at 9:30.

20:54.685 --> 20:58.721
- Atlantic Avenue where it crosses--
- You take me.

20:58.822 --> 21:02.024
I am not a chauffeur, sir.

21:05.161 --> 21:07.596
No offense. I'll get a hack.
What's it called?

21:09.332 --> 21:10.932
Knives & Forks?

21:11.033 --> 21:14.235
I eat here again,
I'm gonna get the trots.

21:16.171 --> 21:18.005
Come.

21:18.106 --> 21:19.974
I will take you in my Packard.

21:23.078 --> 21:24.812
<i>All aboard!</i>

21:31.252 --> 21:33.119
It's okay.

21:38.292 --> 21:40.527
Is that all that's left? There's
supposed to be 20 kids.

21:40.628 --> 21:42.362
We'll cut it.

21:45.967 --> 21:48.134
Just so you know,

21:48.493 --> 21:50.084
I was zazzled last time.

21:50.204 --> 21:53.073
Or else I would never
have let him do that..

21:54.881 --> 21:57.506
Wasn't for my pop
what he'd do to me,

21:57.626 --> 21:59.215
Henry'd be short some teeth,

22:01.026 --> 22:03.243
Probably he'd just have
his dad by him new ones.

22:04.851 --> 22:07.753
He's gonna be there,
you know, tonight,

22:07.854 --> 22:09.755
drinking your booze again.

22:09.856 --> 22:12.124
If we cut these three
and make six,

22:12.225 --> 22:14.558
you think that's enough
to get everybody tight?

22:14.659 --> 22:16.494
Sure.

22:16.595 --> 22:18.997
That one for us?

22:19.098 --> 22:21.832
This is for my old pal Henry.

22:21.934 --> 22:23.634
My buddy.

22:38.349 --> 22:39.649
You did good back there.

22:39.750 --> 22:42.886
Thank you, but I really
should be going.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.454
Buzz again.

22:44.555 --> 22:46.488
Give it a minute.

22:50.227 --> 22:52.395
All right.
Hold your horses.

22:52.495 --> 22:54.363
My wife, she's making lapskaus.

22:54.464 --> 22:55.998
It's a type of stew.

22:56.099 --> 22:57.566
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.635
Jerry Flentje, he home?

22:59.736 --> 23:02.037
He's always home. What, you want him?
Ring his buzzer.

23:03.672 --> 23:07.275
Miss, we've come
a long way to see our pal.

23:07.376 --> 23:10.078
And a good surprise is nothing

23:10.179 --> 23:12.047
without the surprise
of the thing, am I right?

23:13.382 --> 23:15.450
- You a friend of his?
- Yeah, we go way back.

23:15.551 --> 23:18.452
I don't see him much anymore
since the two bums got married.

23:18.553 --> 23:20.854
We know Jerry lives here,

23:20.956 --> 23:23.090
just not what apartment.

23:25.093 --> 23:27.227
2D.

23:27.329 --> 23:30.730
I'm 1C in case he ain't home
and you want to leave a note.

24:03.729 --> 24:05.529
<i>What do you want?</i>

24:05.630 --> 24:07.031
- I can't.
- Don't be scared.

24:07.132 --> 24:09.666
<i>Who the
fuck let them in?!</i>

24:20.879 --> 24:22.379
Nice job.

24:43.033 --> 24:44.799
This Tampa thing goes,

24:44.901 --> 24:46.801
you think you can
run things here?

24:48.138 --> 24:51.073
- You'd move?
- McCoy's a good man,

24:51.174 --> 24:53.874
but he can't build a city
from the ground up.

24:53.975 --> 24:55.543
This is home, Nuck.

24:55.644 --> 24:57.278
You got family.

24:57.379 --> 24:59.180
You've got family.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.951
You are family, too, of course.

25:04.053 --> 25:06.020
June, the kids.

25:06.121 --> 25:08.322
But it's not the same.

25:15.129 --> 25:16.930
Whatever you need,
I'll take care of it.

25:18.899 --> 25:20.100
Thank you.

25:20.201 --> 25:22.635
If Rothstein kicks in,
you take the money,

25:22.736 --> 25:25.072
meet McCoy down in Tampa.

25:25.173 --> 25:27.273
Sure.

25:27.374 --> 25:29.308
I just...

25:29.409 --> 25:31.678
Willie's away at school.

25:31.779 --> 25:33.345
There are some growing pains.

25:33.447 --> 25:35.214
Four days, tops.

25:35.315 --> 25:38.484
- If it wasn't so much cash, I'd send Eddie.
- No, I got it.

25:38.586 --> 25:40.653
Might as well see
what all the fuss is about.

25:46.092 --> 25:47.759
Sorry to interrupt.

25:47.860 --> 25:49.294
Rothstein?

25:49.395 --> 25:51.362
Got himself a game going.

25:51.464 --> 25:53.932
- What'd he buy in for?
- 100 grand.

25:54.033 --> 25:57.202
- So he's up?
- That ain't why I came.

25:57.303 --> 26:00.537
He requesting the pleasure
of your company.

26:13.418 --> 26:16.252
- Castor oil?
- It's not strong enough.

26:27.965 --> 26:29.999
How about milk of magnesia?

26:30.100 --> 26:32.701
When we broke it down in class, I
got the squirts just smelling it.

26:32.802 --> 26:35.504
I like your thinkin', Lincoln.
We'll make our own.

26:35.605 --> 26:38.774
What was in it?
Two compounds linoleic acid?

26:38.875 --> 26:40.442
<i>I think.</i>

26:40.543 --> 26:44.013
Magnesium hydroxide.

26:45.414 --> 26:48.282
We'll whip up a batch,
spike Henry's booze,

26:48.383 --> 26:50.518
- then stand back.
- Way back.

26:50.619 --> 26:51.819
Kaboom.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.721
Couldn't happen
to a sweller feller.

27:01.729 --> 27:04.497
I believe you left
some lamb unscathed.

27:04.598 --> 27:06.900
You know,
most joints like this,

27:07.001 --> 27:08.802
they skimp on the seasonings.

27:11.605 --> 27:13.774
Come to Chicago.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.575
Take you to the Blackhawk.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.477
Prime rib the size
of a manhole cover.

27:18.578 --> 27:20.680
And you'd like it, Chicago.

27:20.781 --> 27:23.849
A lot of krauts.

27:23.950 --> 27:25.851
How long you work for Nucky?

27:25.952 --> 27:28.287
11 years this past November.

27:28.388 --> 27:30.455
You ain't just no bagman, then.

27:30.557 --> 27:33.993
I am Mr. Thompson's
<i>chargé d'affaires.</i>

27:34.094 --> 27:36.295
I'm kind of like
an equal partner

27:36.396 --> 27:38.263
in what we got going on
back in Chicago.

27:38.364 --> 27:39.898
I met your brother Albert.

27:39.999 --> 27:42.601
Alphonse.
Good kid.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.103
A little colicky as a baby.

27:50.909 --> 27:52.876
Gonna make me drink alone?

27:52.977 --> 27:55.479
Perhaps a touch.

28:00.319 --> 28:02.653
I missed out on
the goin'-ons last summer.

28:02.754 --> 28:05.789
I heard it got messy.
Lucky you had friends, huh?

28:05.890 --> 28:09.292
All parties involved
seem to have benefited.

28:09.393 --> 28:11.628
I ain't sore I missed it.

28:11.730 --> 28:13.197
I got a kid.

28:13.297 --> 28:16.133
Some of us were not so lucky.

28:16.234 --> 28:18.769
Really?
Caught some lead?

28:18.870 --> 28:21.905
Not as bad as some.

28:22.006 --> 28:24.240
Me,

28:24.341 --> 28:27.210
I usually handle the more
executive angle of things.

28:27.310 --> 28:29.779
I run a bottling plant,

28:29.880 --> 28:32.782
I make sure that the books
look legit for the operation.

28:32.883 --> 28:36.185
Appearances are as important
as reality, Mr. Capone.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.356
So what about you?
Got a family?

28:40.457 --> 28:42.958
Ah, two sons.

28:43.059 --> 28:45.861
Both of them grown in Germany.

28:45.962 --> 28:48.997
One of them is the assistant
to the burgermeister.

28:49.098 --> 28:50.932
A chef?

28:51.033 --> 28:53.569
And the other
is a dental surgeon.

28:53.670 --> 28:55.370
But nothing like America, huh?

28:55.471 --> 28:58.239
With the boys growing
into fine young men,

28:58.340 --> 28:59.907
my wife passed on...

29:00.008 --> 29:01.876
I'm sorry to hear it.

29:01.977 --> 29:04.979
...I felt I could make
a new life here.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.248
Like me moving to Chicago.

29:07.349 --> 29:08.716
Ah.

29:08.817 --> 29:12.619
Fate has a way of setting
things in order.

29:15.456 --> 29:17.891
To new lives,
Mr. Capone.

29:19.394 --> 29:22.462
- Call me Bottles.
- Edward.

29:28.001 --> 29:30.736
<i>Come on, let's dance!</i>

29:37.678 --> 29:39.378
Cheers!

29:39.479 --> 29:40.613
Here you go, Bucket.

29:40.714 --> 29:42.315
Isn't he ever
gonna put that down?

29:42.416 --> 29:43.782
Let's go over and distract him.

29:43.882 --> 29:45.550
You chat him up,
I'll pour it in.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.985
Just give it to me.
Come on.

29:49.822 --> 29:52.023
Not too much or he'll
be able to taste it.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.558
Three fingers or so.
Oops.

29:54.659 --> 29:57.161
- What?
- Want me to clear out?

30:00.432 --> 30:02.633
Hey, enjoying the party?

30:02.734 --> 30:04.168
It's okay.

30:04.269 --> 30:06.502
You look nice.

30:06.603 --> 30:08.538
Find someone else
to flirt with.

30:08.639 --> 30:09.973
Why not you?

30:10.074 --> 30:12.508
I mean someone you
haven't suckered yet.

30:13.744 --> 30:15.411
You think I was part of that?

30:15.512 --> 30:18.181
No, you're a babe in the woods.

30:20.684 --> 30:22.451
Have it your way.

30:35.365 --> 30:37.398
Is that what you wanted?

30:53.681 --> 30:56.950
Thompson.
Good stuff you brought.

30:57.051 --> 30:58.551
We aim to please.

31:17.271 --> 31:19.272
Raise, 1,000.

31:30.016 --> 31:32.317
Surely things
aren't that bad, Nucky.

31:33.852 --> 31:36.621
I keep it that way
by rarely playing.

31:36.722 --> 31:38.790
This is a game of skill.

31:44.529 --> 31:47.664
I suppose an intermediate position
is better than none at all.

31:47.765 --> 31:50.334
Oh, sure, if action
is your only goal.

31:50.435 --> 31:52.403
Why else would I have
asked you to play?

31:52.503 --> 31:54.204
"You can't really
know a man..."?

31:54.306 --> 31:57.606
Come on, you gonna
raise or not?

31:59.476 --> 32:01.945
You fancy yourself
a sportsman, Arnold.

32:02.046 --> 32:03.446
What would you do here?

32:03.547 --> 32:05.481
I would play against me
like you mean it.

32:06.984 --> 32:09.552
Says the big Ike
been losing all night.

32:09.653 --> 32:12.422
How about you keep your
observations to yourself?

32:13.689 --> 32:15.357
Are you in this game?

32:15.458 --> 32:17.225
'Cause this is my money
on the felt.

32:17.327 --> 32:20.528
The gentleman's bought a
right to an opinion, Meyer.

32:20.629 --> 32:23.798
Meyer. Arnold.
Arnold. Meyer.

32:23.899 --> 32:25.767
Isch gabibble dibble dabble.

32:33.775 --> 32:35.809
Raising 5,000.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.212
And now you've got
my attention.

32:44.953 --> 32:47.153
Doctor.

32:49.690 --> 32:51.657
Speak to you?

32:51.758 --> 32:53.960
Meet me after the salon.

32:55.662 --> 32:58.764
You have until
127th Street, Mr. Purnsley.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.336
First off, regards coming to

33:04.437 --> 33:06.671
your place of business,
I apologize.

33:06.772 --> 33:09.674
Industriousness is a rarely
acknowledged virtue of the Negro,

33:09.775 --> 33:12.177
so I accept and acknowledge.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.780
Your Mr. White,

33:15.882 --> 33:17.815
his time is past

33:17.916 --> 33:19.984
and his place uncertain.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.753
Got the club.
Whole Northside, too.

33:22.854 --> 33:25.189
A plantation run by Nordics

33:25.290 --> 33:27.370
who throw you scraps enough
to keep you from starving,

33:27.459 --> 33:29.327
but not enough
to make your belly full.

33:29.428 --> 33:32.930
That's why I come. You tell
me what you need down there.

33:33.031 --> 33:36.866
I don't need some skylark
nigger, Mr. Purnsley.

33:36.967 --> 33:39.836
That ain't me, sir.
Never was.

33:41.672 --> 33:43.240
All of this,

33:43.341 --> 33:46.043
touched by the black hand
of the creator.

33:46.144 --> 33:49.711
In Harlem, we should give no
more tribute to a Nucky Thompson

33:49.812 --> 33:52.381
or any Nordic
than we would a bottle fly.

33:52.482 --> 33:56.052
Your Northside may
as well be Mississippi.

33:56.153 --> 33:59.088
If you had the right man
running things down there...

33:59.189 --> 34:00.756
<i>Where you afro fools going?</i>

34:00.857 --> 34:03.526
<i>The downfall of
the Libyan, Mr. Purnsley,</i>

34:03.626 --> 34:06.061
<i>is what we used to call</i>
<i>a duppy in the islands.</i>

34:06.162 --> 34:09.330
A duppy is a vampire

34:09.431 --> 34:13.668
who sucks the blood from
his people, lays them low.

34:13.768 --> 34:16.938
This duppy gad about
as if he in a brier patch,

34:17.039 --> 34:19.239
waiting for master
to ring the dinner bell.

34:19.341 --> 34:23.110
Our people flourish
when they are able

34:23.210 --> 34:25.312
to be the angels
of their better natures.

34:25.413 --> 34:28.715
This duppy, this nigger,

34:28.815 --> 34:32.453
is what will happen
unless there are Libyans

34:32.554 --> 34:35.255
prepared to instruct him
in the uplift

34:35.356 --> 34:38.023
of the race.

34:43.230 --> 34:45.898
She is fine. That's yours?

34:57.577 --> 35:00.112
Nigger, you lost
your goddamn mind.

35:04.550 --> 35:06.951
<i>Fuck!</i>

35:32.209 --> 35:34.076
Who, Mueller?

35:34.178 --> 35:35.811
Hand to God.
Ask him.

35:35.912 --> 35:38.914
It's true.
It's called akavit.

35:39.016 --> 35:41.050
- What's it taste like?
- Like shit.

35:41.151 --> 35:43.152
Like shit.

35:45.355 --> 35:46.988
Good for you,

35:47.089 --> 35:49.625
skimming from that Irish fuck.

35:49.725 --> 35:51.960
Tell you what,

35:52.061 --> 35:54.729
you keep busting heads for us
while we square this election,

35:54.830 --> 35:57.565
we'll give you
the-- the aka--

35:57.666 --> 35:59.233
- What is it?
- Akavit.

35:59.334 --> 36:00.668
Yeah, right.

36:00.769 --> 36:02.436
You get the Cicero
action on it.

36:02.538 --> 36:04.338
Much as you can make.

36:04.439 --> 36:07.908
- But Mr. O'Banion is--
- Cicero is where the action is gonna be.

36:08.009 --> 36:10.010
Pick a winner, Mueller.

36:12.847 --> 36:14.648
Fuck me.

36:14.748 --> 36:16.783
Ain't that one
of O'Banion's speaks?

36:16.884 --> 36:18.851
Mueller.

36:20.821 --> 36:22.389
- I, uh...
- Yeah, it is.

36:22.490 --> 36:25.024
They use the bread
trucks for booze.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.160
And if you're stupid enough
to leave your shipment

36:27.261 --> 36:29.795
- right out on the street...
- You're practically begging us.

36:31.130 --> 36:32.798
It may just be a bread truck.

36:34.534 --> 36:36.402
I may be kinda hungry.

36:36.503 --> 36:38.637
Yeah, I could eat.

36:39.673 --> 36:41.840
You follow in the car.

36:48.914 --> 36:51.382
- Mr. Capone, please. I--
- Come on, get in.

36:51.483 --> 36:53.218
Get in!

36:57.122 --> 36:59.224
Live a little, huh?

37:03.628 --> 37:06.730
Wa-hoo!

37:09.634 --> 37:11.568
Whoo!

37:12.837 --> 37:14.571
It's to you, sir.

37:20.844 --> 37:24.179
Do you recall our first
encounter, Mr. Thompson?

37:25.415 --> 37:28.050
You needed supplies
for a wedding.

37:28.151 --> 37:29.752
Is that what I said?

37:29.853 --> 37:31.687
Something like that.

37:31.788 --> 37:33.255
What the hell
are we doing here?

37:33.356 --> 37:35.624
You were a type I'd recognized.

37:35.725 --> 37:37.125
What type is that?

37:37.226 --> 37:39.994
Small-town glad-hander
peering over the fence,

37:40.095 --> 37:42.597
eager to stick his finger
in a new piece of pie.

37:45.801 --> 37:47.402
I don't like pie.

37:49.337 --> 37:51.171
Well,

37:51.273 --> 37:53.641
I have learned
something new about you.

37:55.277 --> 37:59.546
Everything you want from me
tonight is on the table.

38:01.516 --> 38:04.585
That's more exciting
to you than it is to me.

38:05.886 --> 38:07.553
Why does that make me sad?

38:07.655 --> 38:10.523
Jesus Christ.

38:10.624 --> 38:12.692
You need to send for a priest?

38:12.793 --> 38:14.560
Maybe not in your case.

38:14.662 --> 38:17.397
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

38:17.498 --> 38:21.267
Yeah, someone who's taking
a long time to lose.

38:22.268 --> 38:24.536
And back off from my shoulder.

38:24.637 --> 38:26.772
Meyer, it's all an aspect
of the contest.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.746
May I impose upon
the house's good nature?

38:35.748 --> 38:38.215
How much?

38:39.551 --> 38:42.186
$200,000.

38:42.287 --> 38:44.689
There are other games, Arnold.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.325
No, there's only
the game you're in now.

38:49.594 --> 38:52.963
Give Mr. Rothstein
a marker for 200,000.

39:13.416 --> 39:15.417
All in.

39:23.593 --> 39:24.860
Call.

39:26.328 --> 39:28.195
Flush, queen high.

39:28.296 --> 39:30.698
<i>Ahem.</i>

39:34.970 --> 39:37.071
I figured you for a straight.

39:37.172 --> 39:39.807
Then you figured me
wrong again.

39:56.289 --> 39:58.624
Nice getting
to know you, Arnold.

40:07.466 --> 40:10.001
...baumkuchen, strudel,
schwarzwalder kirschtorte.

40:10.102 --> 40:12.236
I swear he gets
fatter by the day.

40:12.337 --> 40:15.072
Because you're getting him
ready for the slaughter.

40:15.173 --> 40:18.009
From strudel chef
to company president.

40:18.110 --> 40:20.712
<i>Ausgezeichnet!</i>

40:20.813 --> 40:23.714
- What's the matter?
- You have missed your train.

40:23.815 --> 40:25.816
Trains are like whores--
you miss one,

40:25.917 --> 40:27.451
you can hop on the next.

40:30.021 --> 40:31.422
- Another round?
- Yeah.

40:33.491 --> 40:35.859
So, how is work with you?

40:35.960 --> 40:38.895
- I have no complaints.
- Since when?

40:38.995 --> 40:41.964
All we've been hearing is how
you despise shining his shoes.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.033
That is no longer
required of me.

40:44.134 --> 40:46.268
Because of the injury?

40:46.369 --> 40:49.439
Because I have
received a promotion.

40:49.540 --> 40:52.475
- Oh!
- What are your new duties?

40:53.643 --> 40:55.544
You will not tell us?

40:58.748 --> 41:00.415
A gangster with a Tommy gun.

41:30.878 --> 41:32.512
What are they singing about?

41:32.613 --> 41:35.281
It's about the Rhine, to be
young, and a pretty girl.

41:35.382 --> 41:38.150
- A happy song, a very happy song.
- Sounds good to me.

42:06.545 --> 42:08.479
You check the other door?

42:10.516 --> 42:12.750
- Come on, come on.
- You put enough in?

42:12.851 --> 42:15.752
I thought I did.
Oh!

42:18.288 --> 42:21.090
Oh! Oh! Oh!

42:22.126 --> 42:23.894
It's occupied, Hank.

42:26.296 --> 42:28.565
I got to go!

42:31.234 --> 42:32.935
Hold up.
Hey, everyone.

42:33.036 --> 42:35.170
Who thinks Henry should
show us the Charleston again?

42:35.271 --> 42:37.873
- Yeah!
- Come on, really cut it up.

42:37.974 --> 42:39.975
- Let me go, Thompson.
- What's the matter?

42:40.076 --> 42:43.546
I got to--

42:46.849 --> 42:48.716
Oh!

42:48.817 --> 42:52.453
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

42:52.555 --> 42:54.889
Oh, jeez.

42:54.990 --> 42:56.958
Oh, my God.

42:57.059 --> 42:59.193
Some air?

42:59.294 --> 43:01.695
You know, most kids are
out of diapers by college.

43:01.796 --> 43:05.398
<i>Disgusting.</i>

43:05.499 --> 43:08.635
Will someone let me
in the john, please?

43:08.736 --> 43:10.671
Who's in the bathroom?

43:21.615 --> 43:23.616
Take the wheel.

43:23.717 --> 43:25.451
Come on.

43:36.161 --> 43:38.529
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

43:38.631 --> 43:41.066
Come on, take a snoot.
Clear your head.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.401
I'm quite alert already.
Thank you.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.107
Beats my wife's coffee,
I'll tell you that much.

43:57.215 --> 43:59.449
So, O'Banion,

43:59.550 --> 44:01.619
he been treating you right?

44:01.720 --> 44:03.687
He's a joker.

44:03.788 --> 44:06.288
A prankster
in a violent sort of way.

44:07.591 --> 44:09.025
Takes things too far, huh?

44:09.126 --> 44:11.560
There's a time for levity.

44:12.763 --> 44:15.098
I do have a sense of humor.

44:18.936 --> 44:22.403
He pays me well, but he doesn't
treat me with respect.

44:23.873 --> 44:26.407
You could work for me.

44:26.509 --> 44:28.043
In Cicero?

44:28.144 --> 44:30.112
Election's coming up.

44:30.212 --> 44:32.313
We get that sewed up,

44:32.414 --> 44:34.315
things are bound to get busier.

44:34.416 --> 44:36.518
And you'd clear it
with Mr. O'--

44:36.619 --> 44:38.139
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

44:38.186 --> 44:39.820
<i>Hello?</i>

44:39.921 --> 44:43.223
<i>Let me out!</i>
<i>Let me out!</i>

44:43.324 --> 44:45.192
<i>It's not funny!</i>
<i>Let me out!</i>

44:54.501 --> 44:56.169
<i>Hello?</i>

44:56.270 --> 44:58.138
You know whose truck this is?

44:58.238 --> 44:59.839
Who the fuck are you?

44:59.940 --> 45:02.909
Sorry. Jesus. Sorry, fellas.
I didn't know it was--

45:03.010 --> 45:05.145
All right, all right.
Relax.

45:05.245 --> 45:06.646
You can take it.

45:06.747 --> 45:09.049
I-- I can walk.

45:09.150 --> 45:12.551
It's my fault anyway.
I fell asleep, you know?

45:13.753 --> 45:15.888
- Mueller?
- No. I--

45:15.989 --> 45:17.956
It's okay. It's okay.
I didn't see nothing.

45:18.058 --> 45:20.225
It's fine.
Take it easy.

45:20.326 --> 45:22.127
Tell you what.

45:22.228 --> 45:24.029
We'll give you 10.

45:24.130 --> 45:25.664
What?

45:25.764 --> 45:29.466
- Okay. Jesus, Jesus.
- Nine, eight, seven...

45:32.504 --> 45:34.105
What do you want me to do?

45:34.206 --> 45:37.041
Makes no difference to us he
tells O'Banion about this.

45:42.180 --> 45:45.182
- Three...
- Fuck. Fuck.

45:45.282 --> 45:48.218
Two...

45:50.154 --> 45:51.888
It's jammed.

46:03.166 --> 46:06.035
Whoo!

46:06.136 --> 46:07.302
One.

46:32.293 --> 46:34.995
Willie.
Willie, wake up.

46:35.096 --> 46:37.197
- What's wrong?
- You better come.

46:51.511 --> 46:54.071
<i>- Hey, guys, what's all the commotion?</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

46:54.114 --> 46:57.216
He kept going to the bathroom all night.
I heard him.

47:00.754 --> 47:03.054
Why won't he close
his eyes or something?

47:11.463 --> 47:13.165
Call.

47:14.221 --> 47:17.435
- Jacks, a pair.
- Fresh deck, please.

47:18.837 --> 47:20.779
Maybe we should
call it a night.

47:20.899 --> 47:23.640
<i>- It's early yet.</i>
<i>- It's nearly dawn.</i>

47:23.741 --> 47:25.976
They're eating dinner in China.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.823
I said fresh deck.

47:39.924 --> 47:42.558
I just opened this one, sir.

47:42.659 --> 47:44.760
I don't like the feel of it.

47:47.664 --> 47:49.265
You have some other engagement?

47:49.366 --> 47:51.766
Don't look at him.

47:51.868 --> 47:53.936
Don't look at him.

47:55.238 --> 47:57.039
Look at me.

47:57.140 --> 47:59.341
I'm the player.

48:00.844 --> 48:02.610
A.R.

48:09.017 --> 48:11.853
Wouldn't it be best

48:11.954 --> 48:14.355
people don't see you like this?

48:26.567 --> 48:28.634
Okey-coakley, Meyer.

48:29.636 --> 48:31.238
Gentlemen.

48:35.609 --> 48:37.877
I've relished the action.

48:46.019 --> 48:48.754
Thanks for the
pocket change, Goldstein.

48:56.762 --> 48:58.729
Rothstein.

49:02.734 --> 49:04.735
Time to settle up.

49:25.523 --> 49:27.656
Mr. Thompson,
I realize--

49:27.757 --> 49:29.325
He's good for up to a million.

49:29.426 --> 49:31.493
Thank you, but no.

49:31.594 --> 49:34.696
I'm asking you don't extend
him any more credit.

49:34.798 --> 49:36.299
Is he not good for it?

49:36.400 --> 49:38.434
Of course he is, but...

49:38.535 --> 49:41.437
everyone hits a rough
patch now and again.

49:42.871 --> 49:44.739
Is that what it is?

49:47.376 --> 49:49.811
He's a great man, A.R.,

49:49.912 --> 49:51.778
but he doesn't like to lose.

49:51.879 --> 49:53.447
Nobody likes to,

49:53.548 --> 49:56.583
but we all have to learn how.

49:56.684 --> 49:59.119
The Tampa deal,
I'm taking it off the table.

49:59.220 --> 50:01.655
- If it's a matter of money--
- It's not.

50:01.756 --> 50:03.490
I can't rely on
a man so blinded

50:03.591 --> 50:05.992
by his obsession with winning.

50:06.093 --> 50:08.428
Tell him I'll find
a new partner.

50:10.564 --> 50:12.966
Would the terms of your
proposal be the same?

50:14.468 --> 50:15.969
- For who?
- For me.

50:19.773 --> 50:21.774
Without Rothstein?

50:21.875 --> 50:24.576
Mr. Rothstein
is not my boss.

50:24.677 --> 50:25.810
We share some
business dealings--

50:25.911 --> 50:27.946
Tell me something
about yourself.

50:29.782 --> 50:31.783
I'm a businessman.

50:31.884 --> 50:34.652
Charlie and I have partnered in
several high-level endeavors.

50:34.753 --> 50:37.655
No, about yourself.

50:37.756 --> 50:40.257
What kind of man you are.

50:46.098 --> 50:48.232
When I was a boy,

50:48.333 --> 50:51.035
my father moved us from Russia

50:51.136 --> 50:53.270
to the Lower East Side.

50:53.372 --> 50:56.939
He was weak, my father.

50:57.041 --> 51:00.343
Never stood up.

51:02.046 --> 51:04.280
One day on my way to school,

51:04.382 --> 51:07.884
I got stopped by a gang
of older boys.

51:07.985 --> 51:10.952
The leader said he wanted
my lunch money.

51:11.054 --> 51:13.489
I told him go fuck himself.

51:13.589 --> 51:15.290
He laughed.

51:15.392 --> 51:17.059
Said hid he'd beat it
out of me.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.028
So I spit in his face.

51:20.130 --> 51:21.830
He did beat me.

51:21.931 --> 51:23.932
They all did.

51:25.068 --> 51:27.201
And they took my money.

51:27.302 --> 51:28.802
Next day, same thing.

51:28.904 --> 51:31.072
Again, I spit in his face,
again we fought.

51:31.173 --> 51:33.607
But the third day,

51:33.708 --> 51:36.144
the kid asked me
to join his gang.

51:38.747 --> 51:40.981
He was Charlie Luciano.

51:41.083 --> 51:43.116
That's how we teamed up.

51:45.819 --> 51:49.322
Last year we made more money than
the President of the United States.

51:51.092 --> 51:54.194
And I think you'll find us
to be responsible partners

51:54.295 --> 51:55.962
both here or in Florida

51:56.064 --> 51:58.630
should you feel the need
for eyes on your investment.

52:04.604 --> 52:06.872
$500,000.

52:06.973 --> 52:08.374
Done.

52:08.475 --> 52:10.543
- In 48 hours.
- Done.

52:15.147 --> 52:16.981
The money doesn't show,

52:17.083 --> 52:19.784
this conversation didn't happen

52:19.885 --> 52:22.287
and it won't ever happen again.

52:58.722 --> 53:00.623
So the election--

53:00.724 --> 53:02.591
you'll help out for the day?

53:02.691 --> 53:06.194
We understand some voters
are still a little confused.

53:06.295 --> 53:08.163
Nice place.

53:10.233 --> 53:11.666
Stick with us.

53:11.767 --> 53:13.301
We'll move you into something
with indoor plumbing.

53:18.140 --> 53:20.441
See you in a few hours.

53:46.267 --> 53:49.269
You know, you never really know a
man until you play cards with him.

53:50.670 --> 53:53.539
Allow me to introduce myself.

54:31.342 --> 54:33.210
Eddie.

54:36.414 --> 54:38.114
Eddie!

54:39.782 --> 54:41.783
Did you need something?

54:43.553 --> 54:45.020
No. Just...

54:45.121 --> 54:47.956
I'm fine.

55:13.581 --> 55:15.949
- <i>Nein, nein, nein.</i>
<i>- What is it?</i>

55:19.920 --> 55:21.788
Whoa, whoa.
I'm gonna--

55:21.889 --> 55:23.790
I'm gonna learn it
for the next time.

55:23.891 --> 55:26.992
Perhaps you should just hum it.

55:30.830 --> 55:32.698
Bottles.

55:32.799 --> 55:35.200
Edward.
I'll be seeing you.

55:35.302 --> 55:37.270
No wooden nickels, huh?

55:47.780 --> 55:49.247
- Mr. Kessler.
- Yes?

55:49.348 --> 55:51.883
We're with the Bureau
of Investigation.

55:53.152 --> 55:55.420
- Gentlemen, I assure you--
- Lower your voice.

55:56.422 --> 55:58.456
I have done nothing wrong.

55:58.557 --> 56:00.858
Nucky Thompson's wet nurse
out all night,

56:00.959 --> 56:02.526
up to who knows what?

56:02.627 --> 56:04.262
If you will allow me
to explain--

56:04.362 --> 56:05.897
- Come with us, please.
- But I have done--

56:05.998 --> 56:07.398
One foot in front of the other.

56:07.499 --> 56:09.600
Don't make a scene.
