00:33.355 --> 00:35.231
Charlie.

00:38.819 --> 00:40.945
Not again.

00:41.238 --> 00:43.364
Come back to bed, baby.

00:44.241 --> 00:47.702
I gotta go to work and you snoozed
on my alarm. I'm gonna be late.

00:47.869 --> 00:52.623
Yeah, well, you peed on me,
so I guess we're even.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.167
I have a weak bladder.

00:55.627 --> 00:57.420
I can't go to work like this.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.088
You work from our kitchen.

00:59.256 --> 01:04.343
Yeah, but my real job
is to change the sheets.

01:27.617 --> 01:32.204
Oh, why is it coffee tastes
so much better when you make it?

01:32.914 --> 01:36.542
Because I make it with love.

01:36.710 --> 01:40.629
And I also make it with bacon.

02:36.853 --> 02:40.147
All right, guys.
If I were to add a C to this word...

02:40.315 --> 02:41.690
...what word would I have?

02:41.858 --> 02:43.359
-I know. I know.
-I know.

02:43.527 --> 02:45.528
A lot of hands, I like it.

02:45.695 --> 02:47.947
How about Hillary?
What do you got for me?

02:48.115 --> 02:50.157
-Can.
-Can is correct.

02:50.325 --> 02:52.618
Hillary, you won
an all-expense-paid trip...

02:52.786 --> 02:55.204
...to the dry-erase board.
Come on. Have at it.

02:55.372 --> 02:58.707
There's a washer-dryer combo in it.
Let's see what you got.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.293
Beautiful C.
Come on, everybody, cheer her on.

03:01.461 --> 03:04.130
That's just-- That's just good stuff.

03:05.674 --> 03:07.133
All right, what's next?

03:07.300 --> 03:09.385
Let's try another one. Okay.

03:09.553 --> 03:13.764
Who's got another letter we can use
to make a word here?

03:14.307 --> 03:15.850
Who's got it? Who's got it?

03:16.017 --> 03:18.310
I'm coming for you,
Ramon Martinez.

03:18.478 --> 03:19.895
What do you got?

03:20.188 --> 03:22.648
-P.
-P is an excellent choice.

03:22.816 --> 03:25.985
And what would that spell?

03:26.695 --> 03:29.446
-Pan?
-Pan is correct, everybody.

03:29.614 --> 03:31.240
All right, come on down, Ramon.

03:31.408 --> 03:33.826
You got this. You can do it.
I believe in you.

03:33.994 --> 03:37.121
Come on. Let's see what you got.
To the board. Put it there.

03:37.289 --> 03:39.456
Okay, this is very exciting.

03:39.624 --> 03:43.252
Look.
Oh, just beautiful penmanship by the--

03:47.674 --> 03:50.968
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, you guys.

03:51.136 --> 03:53.929
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

03:55.515 --> 03:57.516
-Oh, my God.
-Miss Hannah.

03:57.684 --> 03:59.101
Are you pregnant?

04:00.520 --> 04:02.271
What?

04:02.939 --> 04:05.774
My mommy threw up
when she was pregnant with my sister.

04:05.942 --> 04:08.110
Are you pregnant?

04:09.613 --> 04:11.238
Are you?

04:21.625 --> 04:23.292
Yes.

04:26.087 --> 04:27.504
Hello in there, you.

04:27.672 --> 04:30.132
I felt you moving.

04:31.801 --> 04:36.429
Vice Principal Davies will be able
to look after your class for the day...

04:36.597 --> 04:39.140
...so that's one less thing
to think about.

04:40.059 --> 04:43.937
I just feel awful for letting that happen
in front of the kids, you know.

04:44.104 --> 04:45.980
Well, don't worry about it.

04:46.148 --> 04:47.899
Kind of comes with the territory.

04:48.067 --> 04:50.193
And those kids, they're pretty tough.

04:50.361 --> 04:52.237
I'm sure they've seen plenty worse.

04:53.656 --> 04:58.701
You know, I was never able
to have a child of my own and so....

04:58.869 --> 05:02.288
Well, now I have about 200 of them.

05:02.456 --> 05:04.457
Be careful what you wish for, right?

05:06.168 --> 05:09.545
I'm so curious to know how it is for you
and how you're feeling--

05:09.713 --> 05:12.173
-Oh, you know--
-And how excited you must be.

05:12.341 --> 05:15.176
It's--
I mean, it's hard to explain exactly...

05:15.344 --> 05:16.761
-Yeah.
-...how it is, but--

05:16.929 --> 05:18.930
It's a responsibility, isn't it?

05:19.932 --> 05:24.018
Probably the biggest responsibility
that we have.

05:42.162 --> 05:43.496
There's a....

05:45.666 --> 05:47.500
Thank you.

05:47.668 --> 05:51.838
Hang on. Hang on one second.
Everybody, please be good.

05:54.717 --> 05:58.761
Is everything okay, Mrs. Hannah?

05:58.929 --> 06:02.265
I just feel really embarrassed, but....

06:02.433 --> 06:06.978
I feel a lot better
and I wanted to thank you, so....

06:07.521 --> 06:08.688
Well....

06:09.064 --> 06:12.066
I know you were drinking this morning.
I saw you.

06:13.444 --> 06:15.903
What? No, no. What--?

06:16.071 --> 06:19.073
Drinking when you're pregnant
is really dangerous.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.118
I know that.

06:28.959 --> 06:30.543
I'm not actually pregnant.

06:32.087 --> 06:35.798
-What?
-It's just-- I'm really hung over.

06:35.966 --> 06:39.761
And the kids started asking me
questions and I threw up and I just--

06:39.928 --> 06:41.471
I....

06:42.848 --> 06:44.390
Okay.

06:44.641 --> 06:46.100
That's....

06:46.268 --> 06:47.435
That's not good.

06:47.603 --> 06:48.686
I know. I know.

06:48.854 --> 06:51.439
Please. Please don't say anything.

06:53.317 --> 06:54.650
Just go home.

06:54.818 --> 06:56.611
Get some sleep.

07:06.872 --> 07:09.123
Next up, we've got Kate.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.334
You got this!

07:14.630 --> 07:19.092
# You gotta be cruel to be kind
In the right measure #

07:19.259 --> 07:22.887
# Cruel to be kind
It's a very good sign #

07:23.055 --> 07:26.140
# Cruel to be kind
Means that I love you #

07:27.518 --> 07:33.314
# Baby
You got to be cruel to be kind #

07:34.441 --> 07:36.275
# Well, I do my best
To understand dear #

07:36.443 --> 07:39.695
# But you still mystify
And I want to know why #

07:40.572 --> 07:44.242
# Ooh, ooh, ooh #

07:44.451 --> 07:46.327
-Yes.
-Yes.

07:46.495 --> 07:48.496
Oh, it just fades out.

07:48.789 --> 07:52.291
Yeah!

07:55.254 --> 07:56.671
Okay.

07:56.839 --> 07:59.090
Who's next?

07:59.633 --> 08:01.342
Your turn.

08:05.139 --> 08:06.722
Baby.

08:08.434 --> 08:10.601
-Hey.
-That was great.

08:10.769 --> 08:13.271
-You sound like an angel.
-Oh, really?

08:13.439 --> 08:16.983
A drunk, drunk, drunk angel.

08:17.568 --> 08:20.361
If you were gonna write about me,
what would you say?

08:20.529 --> 08:24.866
I would say that I have the sexiest...

08:25.033 --> 08:29.829
...most amazing wife on the planet.
The entire planet.

08:29.997 --> 08:33.541
Oh, and it'd be such a shitty article
and nobody would read it.

08:35.294 --> 08:37.628
I gotta go. I got work to do.

08:38.714 --> 08:41.131
You boys have fun.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.674
-Goodbye. I love you.
-Bye.

08:42.842 --> 08:45.011
Goodbye. I love you.

08:51.143 --> 08:53.561
Hey, are you okay?

08:53.729 --> 08:56.230
You know what, girl? I am not okay.

08:56.398 --> 08:57.440
-You're not?
-No.

08:57.608 --> 09:02.904
My bitch sister just-- She just took off
and left me here to go hook up...

09:03.071 --> 09:04.822
...with this asshole.

09:04.990 --> 09:07.241
And now I don't have a car.

09:07.576 --> 09:08.868
I don't have a ride.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.996
-I don't know what to do.
-Man.

09:12.164 --> 09:14.582
I mean, I guess--

09:14.750 --> 09:18.419
You could give me a ride?
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

09:18.587 --> 09:19.837
Thank you so much.

09:20.005 --> 09:22.590
I was gonna say call you a cab.
I don't know you.

09:22.758 --> 09:23.758
No, no, no.

09:23.926 --> 09:26.511
No, I-- It's very close.

09:27.012 --> 09:29.847
Please?

09:34.102 --> 09:36.437
You know,
you shouldn't drink and drive.

09:36.605 --> 09:38.272
-I wasn't--
-I'm just kidding.

09:38.607 --> 09:39.941
Can I have a sip?

09:41.401 --> 09:42.902
I'm so thirsty.

09:43.070 --> 09:44.278
It's whiskey, so....

09:44.446 --> 09:49.033
Fuck, yeah, it's whiskey.
I fucking love whiskey.

09:51.370 --> 09:55.039
You are a hardcore drinking bitch
like me.

09:55.541 --> 09:58.042
I don't know about that.
I don't know.

09:58.210 --> 10:00.753
You're such a cute little bitch.

10:01.838 --> 10:03.256
Thank you.

10:03.423 --> 10:06.008
Hey, can I smoke in the car?

10:06.885 --> 10:08.302
Okay. Yeah, that's fine.

10:08.470 --> 10:10.846
Can you just roll the window down?

10:11.181 --> 10:13.849
Of course. I'm not uncivilized.

10:19.314 --> 10:22.441
What--? That's not what I thought
you were talking about.

10:23.569 --> 10:28.948
# I wanna see
The bright lights tonight #

10:30.409 --> 10:31.534
Do you want a hit?

10:31.702 --> 10:33.828
Oh, what is it? Is it pot?

10:33.996 --> 10:35.413
Of course not.

10:35.581 --> 10:38.749
Do I look like a hippie? It's crack.

10:38.917 --> 10:40.126
Oh, shit.

10:40.294 --> 10:43.170
-Shit.
-No, no, no. It's good crack. It's good.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.840
-I have never done crack before.
-Really?

10:46.008 --> 10:49.468
It is amazing.

10:49.636 --> 10:52.597
It's gonna sober your butt up too.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.767
-Just take a hit.
-All right. Okay, one puff.

10:56.935 --> 10:58.894
You're so smart.

10:59.062 --> 11:01.689
You're really a wise girl.

11:04.901 --> 11:10.114
# I need to spend some money
And it just won't wait #

11:11.992 --> 11:15.369
# Take me to the dance
And hold me tight #

11:18.707 --> 11:23.794
# I wanna see
The bright lights tonight #

11:26.214 --> 11:28.758
I feel like I know
what it's like to be homeless.

11:28.925 --> 11:32.303
If you saw me, you didn't know me,
we hadn't connected tonight...

11:32.471 --> 11:35.931
...you might think, "There goes
some upper-class, NPR-listening...

11:36.099 --> 11:39.727
...lazy, liberal, self-congratulatory,
never-been-through-anything--"

11:39.895 --> 11:42.438
And it's not true. I grew up poor.

11:42.606 --> 11:46.484
Single mother. Single mother.
There was this thing at McDonald's.

11:46.652 --> 11:49.612
They'd sell 29-cent hamburgers,
39-cent cheeseburgers...

11:49.780 --> 11:52.782
...and we would go there
and she would buy 20 of them.

11:52.949 --> 11:54.241
That was the limit.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.869
People like us,
we'd put them in a freezer.

11:57.037 --> 11:59.747
And, yeah,
I had a weight issue in high school.

11:59.915 --> 12:03.834
I did, I admit that. But when I started
drinking, I stopped eating so much.

12:04.002 --> 12:06.921
What I'm saying is that you and me--

12:07.089 --> 12:09.256
You and me,
we are not that different.

14:13.714 --> 14:15.548
It's okay. Go to sleep. It's fine.

14:15.716 --> 14:18.051
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Oh, babe.

14:19.678 --> 14:22.472
I'm so glad you're okay.

14:29.897 --> 14:31.439
Listen....

14:35.861 --> 14:38.321
I don't think I can do this anymore.

14:38.906 --> 14:42.408
I think I need to slow down.

14:42.576 --> 14:45.078
-Yeah?
-And...

14:46.330 --> 14:47.539
...I might need help.

14:47.832 --> 14:49.374
Hey.

14:50.793 --> 14:52.168
I'll help you.

14:54.088 --> 14:55.547
Yeah.

14:57.091 --> 14:59.133
All right,
I'm gonna tell you something.

14:59.301 --> 15:01.928
But you have to promise
not to tell anybody, okay?

15:02.096 --> 15:03.888
Okay. I promise.

15:04.056 --> 15:05.974
I'm serious. Not even your brother.

15:06.141 --> 15:07.934
Of course. What?

15:12.565 --> 15:14.649
Last night, I ended up...

15:14.984 --> 15:16.526
...kind of...

15:18.362 --> 15:19.404
...smoking crack.

15:21.448 --> 15:23.783
Wait. What?

15:23.951 --> 15:27.161
There was this drunk girl
outside the bar. She needed help.

15:27.329 --> 15:30.957
She needed a ride. I didn't know--
I ended up smoking crack.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.458
Wait, wait, wait.

15:32.626 --> 15:35.003
How does that even happen?

15:35.170 --> 15:39.048
I mean, so you give someone a ride
and she rewards you with crack?

15:39.216 --> 15:40.800
She seemed desperate, okay?

15:40.968 --> 15:42.969
She's-- She needed a ride home.

15:43.137 --> 15:44.596
Where? Where does she live?

15:44.763 --> 15:47.473
Downtown. I think she....

15:47.933 --> 15:50.435
Maybe she lived in a tent.

15:50.603 --> 15:51.644
I don't know.

15:51.812 --> 15:52.896
-What?
-I don't know.

15:53.063 --> 15:56.900
She might have been homeless.
She might have been a prostitute.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.985
Hey. Okay.

15:59.653 --> 16:01.821
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

16:01.989 --> 16:05.533
Maybe it's the crack smoking...

16:05.701 --> 16:08.036
...you need help with
and not the drinking.

16:08.203 --> 16:09.829
I'm just saying.

16:10.623 --> 16:13.583
Well, the drinking is what led
to the crack smoking.

16:13.751 --> 16:17.837
And the drinking is what leads
to everything stupid that I do.

16:18.339 --> 16:19.964
Charlie....

16:24.136 --> 16:26.137
Look, okay, we'll just....

16:26.305 --> 16:31.142
We'll just chill out on the drinking,
okay?

16:31.310 --> 16:37.690
We'll just be, you know,
wine-with-dinner people.

16:39.276 --> 16:40.860
Yeah?

16:44.198 --> 16:45.531
-We're good.
-Are we good?

16:45.699 --> 16:48.117
-We're good. Go, go, go.
-Coming.

16:53.832 --> 16:55.875
I want some gummy bears
on a snow cone.

16:56.043 --> 16:58.753
Okay, I'll find you one.

16:59.838 --> 17:01.214
That's a clown, babe.

17:01.382 --> 17:04.384
-That was a clown. Did you see that?
-It's a clown, babe.

17:05.219 --> 17:07.553
-Watch out for the crack.
-Where? What crack?

17:07.721 --> 17:10.390
Oh, I thought there was a crack
next to--

17:10.557 --> 17:12.558
I don't know.
You must have smoked it.

17:12.726 --> 17:16.896
Oh, you're so funny. You're so--

17:17.064 --> 17:19.732
I was drunk, okay?
Get over it, Charlie.

17:19.900 --> 17:24.069
Well, maybe you should go to one
of those-- You know, those meetings.

17:24.238 --> 17:25.863
Remember when I went in there?

17:26.906 --> 17:31.327
-Stole one of those Q&A pamphlets.
-Holy shit, yes.

17:31.662 --> 17:34.247
And then we answered
all the questions "yes"...

17:34.415 --> 17:38.001
...and at the end, it said, "If you
answered these questions 'yes'...

17:38.168 --> 17:41.421
...you might be an alcoholic."

17:41.588 --> 17:45.008
-Hey, let's drink the tequila.
-Yes. I want some margaritas.

17:59.940 --> 18:02.400
-Oh, you didn't.
-I did.

18:02.568 --> 18:03.901
-I'm gonna get you.
-No.

18:04.069 --> 18:06.863
-Yeah?
-No. No. No!

18:22.296 --> 18:23.796
Charlie.

18:27.009 --> 18:31.387
Come on, Charlie. Come on.

18:32.014 --> 18:33.556
Come on.

18:33.724 --> 18:36.142
-What's happening?
-You almost fell asleep.

18:36.310 --> 18:40.188
-Don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep.
-Yeah. No. I'm not, I'm not.

18:40.355 --> 18:42.231
Okay. Okay.

19:26.568 --> 19:48.047
Hi.

19:48.215 --> 19:50.424
What?

20:10.654 --> 20:12.405
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:12.573 --> 20:14.699
I can't sell you these.

20:14.867 --> 20:18.578
-Sorry, I can't.
-Why? Why? Oh, you can't tell I'm 21 ?

20:18.745 --> 20:22.331
Come on. Come on,
I'm in here all the time. You know me.

20:22.499 --> 20:24.584
Yeah, I know you and I like you.

20:24.751 --> 20:27.837
But I can't sell you these
because it's too late.

20:28.005 --> 20:31.591
Oh, well, we can just pretend
it's before 2, right?

20:31.758 --> 20:34.176
Look. Look, it's only 1:45.

20:34.343 --> 20:36.845
-Stop. Stop.
-It's totally fine.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.558
-Come on, man, it's just a little wine.
-Seriously, it's not gonna happen.

20:41.726 --> 20:44.686
I'm not even driving or anything.
Come on.

20:44.854 --> 20:45.937
And you know what?

20:46.105 --> 20:48.481
If you give it to me,
I'll let you have a sip.

20:48.649 --> 20:50.650
Gonna let you have a sip.

20:51.194 --> 20:53.528
As enticing as that is, it's the law.

20:53.696 --> 20:56.823
And I can't sell you alcohol after 2 a.m.
And you know this.

20:56.991 --> 20:59.492
Then why don't you just give it to me,
okay?

20:59.660 --> 21:03.079
Like a friend, a gift for a friend.
And that won't hurt anybody.

21:03.247 --> 21:05.624
Because I don't wanna lose my job.

21:12.048 --> 21:13.340
You, hey.

21:13.507 --> 21:16.843
You. You. You distract him, okay?

21:17.011 --> 21:21.056
Kate, why don't you get, like, a bottle
of water or a coffee or something?

21:21.224 --> 21:26.311
-Water or coffee.
-Yeah.

21:26.479 --> 21:29.648
Really? Really?
Because I won't suck your dick?

21:29.815 --> 21:32.317
-Okay, you gotta go.
-Fuck you.

21:32.485 --> 21:35.528
-No, that's enough. You gotta go.
-Fuck you, okay?

21:35.696 --> 21:39.074
This is bullshit. So fuck you.

21:39.242 --> 21:40.533
Oh, I have to pee.

21:40.701 --> 21:42.744
-Kate. Kate.
-Oh, I have to pee.

21:42.912 --> 21:44.454
Where are you going?

21:46.999 --> 21:49.084
Shit. Come on, Kate.

21:49.252 --> 21:51.628
Oh, it's locked. It's locked.

21:53.130 --> 21:55.674
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Sorry. I just--

21:55.841 --> 21:58.843
I have to pee really, really bad
sometimes.

21:59.345 --> 22:01.513
Just go, please.

22:03.432 --> 22:05.934
Holy shit.

22:10.773 --> 22:13.400
You seriously just pissed the floor?

22:16.612 --> 22:18.196
Out.

22:23.911 --> 22:26.871
Kate. What--? No. Hey, hey, hey!

23:48.454 --> 23:50.830
Is everything okay with you?

23:54.126 --> 23:55.960
I don't know.

23:57.922 --> 23:59.547
No.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.384
I mean...

24:03.803 --> 24:08.223
...I puked in front of bunch of little kids
and told everybody I'm pregnant, so....

24:08.766 --> 24:11.601
Yeah, I don't think that's really okay,
is it?

24:11.852 --> 24:14.062
No, I don't think so.

24:20.152 --> 24:21.277
I normally...

24:22.405 --> 24:26.199
...don't tell people I work with
about this...

24:26.492 --> 24:32.831
...but I'm a bit of an expert
when it comes to these things.

24:35.835 --> 24:38.002
-You?
-Yeah, me.

24:38.629 --> 24:40.588
I've lived a strange one.

24:40.756 --> 24:44.217
I'm nine years sober, AA and NA.

24:47.012 --> 24:50.181
I used to drink cocaine.

24:52.685 --> 24:54.853
It's really cheap in the Philippines.

24:56.564 --> 24:58.523
Listen, Kate...

24:58.732 --> 25:02.277
...I know meetings are weird.

25:02.445 --> 25:03.945
Especially at first.

25:04.113 --> 25:06.531
But if you want to--

25:06.699 --> 25:10.368
I mean, you never need
to feel like you have to.

25:10.536 --> 25:14.539
But the ones I go to are pretty small,
nice little groups.

25:14.707 --> 25:17.542
So I'd be happy to take you.

25:20.129 --> 25:22.714
No pressure, okay?

25:23.048 --> 25:24.883
That shit saved my life though.

25:26.135 --> 25:29.262
-Patricia.
-Oh, well, hello, Dave.

25:29.430 --> 25:31.806
What are you up to today,
or dare I ask?

25:31.974 --> 25:33.892
No good as usual.

25:34.059 --> 25:37.729
I'm off to watch Miss Carol's art class
make some macaroni art.

25:38.230 --> 25:41.149
-Pretty stoked.
-Oh, Dave.

25:41.317 --> 25:43.443
-Have a nice day, ladies.
-All right.

25:43.611 --> 25:45.737
-Hey, Kate, I got you something.
-Hey.

25:45.905 --> 25:49.157
Yeah. Look at this.

25:49.408 --> 25:52.452
-OJ. Folic acid.
-Right, right.

25:52.620 --> 25:57.040
You need this right now.
It's very important for that baby.

25:57.291 --> 26:00.585
Boy. Well, your mom must be
just about over the moon right now.

26:00.753 --> 26:05.673
I bet she's home making baby clothes
and planning a shower and--

26:05.841 --> 26:10.011
Oh, my mom and I
aren't really that close, so....

26:10.179 --> 26:12.096
Oh, you're not close with your mom?

26:12.389 --> 26:14.390
-Nope.
-I'm sorry.

26:14.975 --> 26:19.270
But you know what? Guess what's
gonna bring you closer together again.

26:20.272 --> 26:22.607
-What?
-This baby.

26:29.907 --> 26:32.700
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:32.952 --> 26:34.744
How was your day?

26:34.912 --> 26:36.996
What's that smell?

26:37.790 --> 26:42.794
It was all right.
Oh, sorry, I made ketchup soup.

26:42.962 --> 26:46.714
Charlie, you have to eat.

26:46.882 --> 26:48.007
What?

26:48.175 --> 26:50.385
It was tasty.

26:50.636 --> 26:56.391
Hey, so I'm gonna go see that band
from Iceland--

26:56.559 --> 26:58.977
You know, with the triplets.
--play tonight.

26:59.144 --> 27:01.646
You wanna go with me and Owen?

27:04.024 --> 27:06.276
Sounds like a lot of fun, but....

27:06.443 --> 27:10.655
Come on, it will be fun. Look, I'm
supposed to review the show for work.

27:10.823 --> 27:12.991
Yeah, it's....

27:13.951 --> 27:17.245
This guy that I work with,
Mr. Davies....

27:17.413 --> 27:20.373
-The vice principal?
-Yeah, he--

27:20.874 --> 27:27.672
It turns out that he's sober
and he invited me to a meeting.

27:31.093 --> 27:34.137
That's-- That's cool.

27:44.857 --> 27:47.317
-Hey. Good.
-Hey.

27:47.651 --> 27:50.028
So this is much more my speed.

27:50.195 --> 27:53.531
I can assure you,
no one here is the slightest bit hip.

27:53.782 --> 27:58.244
And I actually looked at this dog with
the intention of trying to explain it...

27:58.412 --> 28:00.496
...and then realized
there was no way...

28:00.664 --> 28:05.543
...that I could get it
through this dog's brain that he--

28:05.711 --> 28:09.631
That what I was doing
was in his best interest...

28:09.798 --> 28:13.551
...even though he couldn't understand
and that his brain was too small.

28:13.719 --> 28:16.554
And when I got home,
both sets were in my bag...

28:16.722 --> 28:18.931
...and I wasn't charged for both.

28:19.099 --> 28:22.894
So I sat with it for a while.

28:23.062 --> 28:28.274
And I lost sleep over it
because I didn't pay for it...

28:28.442 --> 28:30.568
...and this is a program of honesty.

28:30.736 --> 28:35.989
All I knew about taking care of myself
was fucking people over...

28:36.783 --> 28:39.117
...lying to get by.

28:40.036 --> 28:43.997
I had no idea
how to even look for a normal job...

28:44.165 --> 28:45.999
...or pay my bills on time.

28:46.167 --> 28:48.502
Hell, pay my bills at all.

28:48.753 --> 28:50.879
Now I pay my bills online.

28:51.047 --> 28:52.422
Yep.

28:53.591 --> 28:55.258
I found a love in cooking.

28:55.426 --> 28:58.595
I have my own
catering business now.

28:59.055 --> 29:05.644
And maybe I have replaced alcohol
with chocolate-chip cookies...

29:05.812 --> 29:09.398
...and vanilla wafers,
banana pudding...

29:09.565 --> 29:13.110
...doughnuts,
jelly doughnuts to be specific...

29:13.277 --> 29:17.280
...potato salad, shawarma...

29:18.491 --> 29:21.201
...and nacho cheese.

29:22.203 --> 29:24.204
Y'all know what I'm talking about.

29:25.248 --> 29:27.374
-I kind of like her.
-It's been years....

29:27.542 --> 29:29.292
-You don't like her?
-I like her.

29:29.460 --> 29:32.421
Oh, you do? Sponsor potential.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.757
Get her number at the break.

29:35.925 --> 29:37.342
But I'm glad.

29:37.510 --> 29:40.512
-You're kind of like my wingman.
-But I have my wounds.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.975
From now on,
I'm going to enjoy my doughnuts.

29:45.143 --> 29:48.478
I prefer them over hangovers.

29:48.813 --> 29:51.273
We'll now have a 10-minute break.

29:54.652 --> 29:59.531
-I just-- I really liked your speech.
-Oh, thank you, honey.

29:59.699 --> 30:05.203
All that dumb shit happened, so now
I'm glad it's at least entertaining.

30:06.998 --> 30:09.833
-What's your name?
-Kate.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.670
This is my first time
at one of these things.

30:14.005 --> 30:18.675
I mean, at least it's my first time
that I'm not wasted, so....

30:18.843 --> 30:22.804
Yeah. I remember doing
some of that myself.

30:26.517 --> 30:30.187
I'm sorry,
I don't really know how this works.

30:30.354 --> 30:33.690
Could I get your number?
I don't know if I'll need it, I just--

30:33.858 --> 30:37.444
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.
I'll be happy to explain it all to you.

30:37.612 --> 30:40.781
And we can also just talk.

30:42.950 --> 30:44.367
Cool.

30:45.703 --> 30:50.248
Look, this is the kind of meeting
where anyone can share.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.833
Sharing always helps me...

30:52.001 --> 30:56.004
...so try introducing yourself
to the group.

31:00.676 --> 31:02.719
I'm Kate.

31:02.887 --> 31:05.096
I'm an alcoholic.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.807
-Hi, Kate.
-Hi, Kate.

31:06.974 --> 31:09.976
I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh.

31:10.144 --> 31:13.146
Those words are weird.

31:15.566 --> 31:17.400
I mean, I guess I--

31:17.735 --> 31:20.987
Yeah. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic,
really. I drink a lot.

31:21.155 --> 31:24.574
And I've always drank a lot.

31:24.742 --> 31:26.910
Everyone I know drinks a lot.

31:28.079 --> 31:30.956
So I never really thought
it was a problem.

31:34.627 --> 31:38.129
But lately,
it kind of seems like it is, so....

31:39.882 --> 31:43.009
I wanna be able to have a beer
without it turning into 20...

31:43.177 --> 31:46.429
...or wetting the bed.

31:48.933 --> 31:52.060
It seems like every time I drink,
something awful happens...

31:52.228 --> 31:55.105
...and all the things
that used to be funny...

31:55.273 --> 31:57.691
...are not really funny anymore...

31:57.859 --> 32:03.947
...and things have gone
from embarrassing to scary, so....

32:05.950 --> 32:07.993
So, yeah, I'm kind of--

32:09.120 --> 32:10.996
I'm kind of scared.

32:15.293 --> 32:17.627
I think we're four seconds in--

32:17.795 --> 32:19.796
I'm in sixth place.
I'm making my move.

32:19.964 --> 32:22.465
I'm getting serious now.
I'm getting serious.

32:22.633 --> 32:25.802
Frightening. It's a story about a--

32:29.640 --> 32:32.309
Perfect, we're not.

32:51.996 --> 32:53.914
Kate, alcoholic.

33:00.338 --> 33:02.672
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

33:06.010 --> 33:07.552
Here we are.

33:09.639 --> 33:10.972
Excuse me.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.183
I am really proud of you, Kate.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.936
God.

33:16.103 --> 33:18.438
I think the longest time
I've been sober...

33:18.606 --> 33:20.982
...since high school was like a week.

33:21.150 --> 33:24.945
My first three months
were such hell.

33:25.112 --> 33:27.364
The only reason
I think I'm sober today...

33:27.531 --> 33:30.992
...is I just never could fathom
going through that again.

33:31.160 --> 33:36.873
Yeah. It's so hard and weird,
and now that I'm not drinking...

33:37.041 --> 33:39.709
...I have these other problems
I have to deal with.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.713
It takes time, right?

33:45.132 --> 33:47.217
My ex-wife, she doesn't drink.

33:47.385 --> 33:49.719
Well, not like us.

33:50.721 --> 33:55.392
As soon as I got sober,
I started to change and she just didn't.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.894
I didn't know you were married.

33:58.062 --> 33:59.104
Yeah.

33:59.271 --> 34:04.067
I was married once, in my other life.

34:07.029 --> 34:10.239
You know, I shouldn't be talking to you
about this stuff.

34:10.408 --> 34:11.992
Why?

34:12.909 --> 34:14.452
I don't know.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.205
Oh, right. Right.

34:17.373 --> 34:21.083
I forgot that men stick with men,
women stick with women.

34:21.252 --> 34:23.503
I don't get all that.

34:24.922 --> 34:28.925
Well, if you were sitting
where I'm sitting, you'd understand.

34:31.762 --> 34:34.764
Are you trying to tell me
you have a crush on me?

34:35.306 --> 34:37.766
What am I, one of your students?
A crush?

34:37.935 --> 34:40.103
Yeah, yeah, a crush.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.481
I kind of do, yeah.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.235
I have a crush on you.

34:48.571 --> 34:51.281
I know that's wrong.
You're newly sober and married.

34:51.614 --> 34:53.992
I shouldn't be thinking about you
like that...

34:54.159 --> 34:56.494
...but, yeah.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.831
I should put that out on the table.
Honesty.

35:00.624 --> 35:02.375
Well, it's okay.

35:03.085 --> 35:05.587
You know,
I think you're a really nice guy.

35:05.755 --> 35:06.963
Oh, great.

35:07.131 --> 35:10.508
Really nice guys are the nerds
who carry the pretty girls' books.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.552
Oh, come on.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.972
I think you're beautiful.

35:17.266 --> 35:20.643
And smart and sexy and cool.

35:20.811 --> 35:23.104
And I know it's wrong...

35:23.272 --> 35:26.232
...but in meetings...

35:26.400 --> 35:30.487
...I just stare at your lips
and your legs.

35:30.654 --> 35:33.990
And I can't stop thinking
about fucking your moist pussy.

35:35.659 --> 35:37.160
What?

35:37.578 --> 35:40.288
-What? What?
-I don't know why I just said that.

35:40.456 --> 35:42.999
I don't know why you just said that.
Oh, my God.

35:43.167 --> 35:44.834
That was a bad thing to say.

35:45.002 --> 35:48.004
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
that was a really bad thing to say.

35:48.172 --> 35:52.008
I am so, so sorry.
I am feeling really confused.

35:52.176 --> 35:54.844
I'm just really not smart
at talking to women.

35:55.012 --> 35:56.930
I mean, who says that?
Who says that?

35:57.098 --> 35:58.807
"Fuck your moist pussy"?

35:58.974 --> 36:01.434
Yeah, it sounds bad now
when you repeat it.

36:01.602 --> 36:03.520
I'm gonna go inside...

36:03.687 --> 36:05.730
-...where I live with my husband.
-Yeah.

36:05.898 --> 36:08.358
Okay? But thanks...

36:08.692 --> 36:11.861
...for your creepy version of honesty.

36:13.989 --> 36:15.657
I'm sorry.

36:16.909 --> 36:19.577
What, did I--? Did I do something?

36:19.745 --> 36:22.205
No, no. It's....

36:23.457 --> 36:25.834
We don't talk.

36:28.045 --> 36:30.046
Well, we used to.

36:30.214 --> 36:35.259
Yeah, but now you just come home
and go to the meetings.

36:35.426 --> 36:38.554
-By the time you get back, I'm just--
-Kind of drunk?

36:38.721 --> 36:42.724
No, I was just--
I was gonna say tired.

36:43.393 --> 36:44.893
I'm....

36:45.728 --> 36:48.188
I have some things
I have to do this weekend...

36:48.356 --> 36:52.151
...and I think I'm gonna go up
to Lake Arrowhead.

36:54.988 --> 36:57.072
To see your mom?

36:59.242 --> 37:00.951
Why?

37:02.078 --> 37:03.579
Do I need a reason?

37:03.746 --> 37:05.956
With your mom?

37:06.332 --> 37:07.791
Kind of.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.668
Yeah.

37:10.295 --> 37:15.048
-Is this the amends step?
-No.

37:16.259 --> 37:19.511
Well, then why are you going?

37:21.097 --> 37:22.931
I just....

37:23.141 --> 37:26.602
We send her checks.

37:26.769 --> 37:29.897
But we don't see her.
I mean, it feels like....

37:30.440 --> 37:33.775
It feels like I'm paying her
not to be in my life.

37:35.320 --> 37:40.032
And I just think it would be nice
to go and see her.

37:42.076 --> 37:43.952
Jenny said it would be a good idea.

37:44.871 --> 37:47.456
-What?
-Nothing.

37:47.624 --> 37:52.461
Now, do you do everything
your sponsor tells you to do?

37:52.629 --> 37:55.214
-No.
-No?

37:55.381 --> 37:58.300
What, you think I can't think
for myself?

37:58.801 --> 38:00.886
Of course.

38:01.763 --> 38:03.555
It's just, you know...

38:03.723 --> 38:09.770
...you haven't seen your mom
in a long damn time.

38:09.938 --> 38:13.148
And you didn't listen to me
when I suggested...

38:13.316 --> 38:15.651
...that we go visit her, so....

38:15.818 --> 38:19.238
-Baby, I listen to you. I do.
-Yeah.

38:19.405 --> 38:22.491
It's just this feels like the right time.

38:22.659 --> 38:27.037
You know, just with everything
that I'm going through, the changes.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.623
Yeah.

38:32.335 --> 38:34.294
I get it.

38:36.756 --> 38:40.175
Well, do you think
I could come with you?

38:40.343 --> 38:42.052
If you come--

38:42.220 --> 38:44.846
-Don't take this the wrong way.
-What?

38:46.099 --> 38:49.017
--I would prefer it if you didn't drink.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.385
Katie.

39:23.553 --> 39:25.053
Hey.

39:25.221 --> 39:26.722
What are you doing here?

39:26.889 --> 39:28.181
I left you a message.

39:28.349 --> 39:32.686
Oh, honey, I don't listen to that.

39:34.564 --> 39:37.316
Hey there, Charlie. How are you?

39:37.483 --> 39:39.234
Hey, Rochelle.

39:39.402 --> 39:42.612
Whoa, this is a surprise.

39:43.573 --> 39:47.159
I can't believe the two of you
came to visit. Hell has frozen over.

39:47.327 --> 39:48.785
Come on.

39:50.413 --> 39:52.414
This calls for a celebration.

39:52.582 --> 39:56.585
Let's have some Bloody Marys.
Come on in.

39:59.172 --> 40:01.256
Water's fine for me, Mom.

40:03.676 --> 40:07.429
You wouldn't believe
how the neighborhood's changed.

40:07.597 --> 40:11.141
When Mr. Baker passed away
and the kids put Mrs. Baker in a home...

40:11.309 --> 40:13.602
...the people that moved in:

40:14.270 --> 40:17.564
There you go. Here, darling.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.775
If you ask me, it's a meth house.

40:19.942 --> 40:24.821
They got these weird little 5-year-old
twins that are playing in the front yard.

40:24.989 --> 40:27.199
But I'm pretty sure they're lookouts.

40:27.367 --> 40:29.159
That's pretty wild, Mom.

40:29.327 --> 40:30.786
Right?

40:30.953 --> 40:34.247
What's the matter, honey?
You think I forgot how to mix them?

40:35.124 --> 40:37.042
Oh, it's just I asked for water.

40:37.335 --> 40:41.630
Please. No means yes where I'm from.
Am I right or am I right?

40:41.798 --> 40:46.468
Well, that's kind of
why I came up here, so....

40:47.053 --> 40:48.470
Yeah.

40:50.973 --> 40:52.057
I stopped drinking.

40:54.936 --> 40:58.146
-Okay.
-I did. I really-- I really did.

40:58.481 --> 41:00.148
You bet.

41:00.733 --> 41:01.817
Oh, are you pregnant?

41:02.235 --> 41:03.610
-Mom.
-How exciting.

41:03.778 --> 41:05.278
I'm gonna be a grandma.

41:05.446 --> 41:08.824
Don't believe that thing about
not drinking when you're pregnant.

41:08.991 --> 41:12.160
I mean, I drank plenty with Katie
when I was pregnant.

41:12.328 --> 41:14.621
Mom, I'm not pregnant.

41:16.165 --> 41:18.583
All right?
I stopped because I needed a break.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.503
Well, good, honey, good.

41:21.671 --> 41:25.424
-We'll see how long it lasts.
-Well, it's lasted a while.

41:28.010 --> 41:30.929
You picked a good partner
for this little adventure.

41:31.097 --> 41:33.014
Well, I'm not drinking--

41:33.182 --> 41:35.892
Oh, Charlie, drink if you want, okay?

41:36.060 --> 41:38.019
He didn't stop. I stopped.

41:38.187 --> 41:40.605
I stopped for me.

41:42.191 --> 41:43.984
And I'm going to 12-step meetings.

41:44.152 --> 41:46.445
Oh, God, Assholes Anonymous.

41:47.071 --> 41:51.241
Katie's father went to those meetings
a few years after we got married.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.118
Dried up, left us.

41:53.494 --> 41:55.745
You can see how well
that worked out for me.

41:55.913 --> 42:00.500
I raised her all by myself in this palace
while he was off in Florida...

42:00.668 --> 42:04.212
...with his shiny new wife and kids,
the son of a bitch.

42:07.049 --> 42:08.633
Be careful.

42:10.303 --> 42:12.220
They can change, you know.

42:13.055 --> 42:16.475
God, I kind of hoped
you'd be happy for me, Mom.

42:16.851 --> 42:19.060
I am, honey, really.

42:21.063 --> 42:24.399
Okay. I'm not being a good hostess.

42:25.276 --> 42:28.195
I'll microwave you your favorite.

42:31.741 --> 42:35.619
Do you wanna change the channel
or do you like these hairdos?

42:36.037 --> 42:38.246
-Stick with hairdos.
-Oh, yeah.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.375
-I had that.
-Did you really?

42:42.543 --> 42:45.337
It was not quite that big,
but it was pretty big.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.767
Me and my Mom used to come here
to Santa's Village...

42:58.935 --> 43:00.602
...every year around Christmas.

43:00.770 --> 43:03.313
It's like the one thing
we did together...

43:03.481 --> 43:05.565
...that was actually fun.

43:09.278 --> 43:11.488
Big-ass candy cane.

43:12.114 --> 43:16.284
When you were younger,
did you ever just, like, sneak away...

43:16.577 --> 43:19.704
...with young boys
and, you know, hook up with them...

43:19.872 --> 43:22.207
-...in the woods?
-What?

44:01.247 --> 44:03.832
Surprise!

44:04.000 --> 44:07.002
Oh, my God,
look at that expression.

44:07.169 --> 44:09.838
Don't be mad.
I thought this would be good for you.

44:10.006 --> 44:12.924
Listen, everybody here
wants to share in your happiness.

44:13.092 --> 44:14.884
Right, everybody?

44:15.678 --> 44:18.847
-This is-- You shouldn't have, really.
-We did.

44:19.599 --> 44:21.850
Okay.

44:22.476 --> 44:24.728
This is from-- This is from Rhonda.

44:24.895 --> 44:27.647
Okay, Rhonda,
let's see what we got.

44:27.815 --> 44:30.775
-Oh, Sad isn't Bad.
-Another one of these.

44:30.943 --> 44:34.820
-Oh, it's the same.
-Oh, hundred percent adorable.

44:34.988 --> 44:37.698
Really pretty, really pretty bag.

44:37.866 --> 44:40.034
Another cute-- Look.

44:40.201 --> 44:41.827
Thank you, Angie.

44:41.995 --> 44:45.414
That is just too cute.

44:46.916 --> 44:48.167
It's so moist.

44:56.217 --> 45:00.888
Kate.

45:04.225 --> 45:05.893
-Kate.
-What?

45:06.061 --> 45:08.729
Listen, I am so, so sorry.

45:08.897 --> 45:11.398
You have no idea
how much this is eating me up.

45:11.566 --> 45:13.484
Look, I'm flattered, okay?

45:13.652 --> 45:17.071
I'm flattered that you have feelings
for me, all right?

45:17.238 --> 45:20.366
-But I'm married.
-I know.

45:21.159 --> 45:23.160
Sorry.
I'll apologize to your husband--

45:23.328 --> 45:26.747
No, no, no. It's fine. I didn't tell him.

45:26.915 --> 45:29.083
Just-- You can't--

45:29.250 --> 45:33.170
You can't say that to a girl, ever.

45:33.713 --> 45:36.256
Really, consider it a rule of thumb,
all right?

45:36.424 --> 45:37.549
Okay.

45:37.717 --> 45:40.844
Because I'm sure one day
you're gonna meet a nice...

45:41.012 --> 45:43.055
...available lady.

45:45.225 --> 45:46.767
But God, if you ever...

45:47.310 --> 45:51.021
...ever say...to her...

45:51.189 --> 45:54.608
...you will never ever, ever, ever see
that part of her body.

45:54.776 --> 45:57.736
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

46:00.031 --> 46:01.615
Thank you.

46:05.870 --> 46:08.539
I feel like this was a really good talk.

46:10.083 --> 46:12.543
That cake was really moist.

46:15.839 --> 46:17.423
See you later.

46:20.468 --> 46:22.428
No, I'm not a terrible....

46:27.392 --> 46:28.851
You don't wanna get married?

46:29.018 --> 46:30.853
No, fuck that, man.

46:34.023 --> 46:36.400
-Hey.
-Hey.

46:36.568 --> 46:38.068
What's up?

46:38.987 --> 46:41.572
I saw you guys found the cake
Jenny and I baked.

46:41.740 --> 46:44.867
Thanks. It was so good, man.
You should go get a slice.

46:45.034 --> 46:47.453
I just thought
we could all eat it together.

46:47.620 --> 46:51.665
Oh, I didn't think about that, babe.
I'm sorry.

46:52.208 --> 46:53.959
-Idiot.
-But, I mean...?

46:56.504 --> 46:58.464
-Was it good?
-It was good.

46:58.798 --> 47:01.592
-It was good.
-Good.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.177
It was really good.

47:03.344 --> 47:05.679
Plenty of tequila
to make up for the cake.

47:05.847 --> 47:08.849
Dude, you know, she doesn't--
Come on, man, she's in AA.

47:09.017 --> 47:10.893
She hasn't drank in, like, forever.

47:11.060 --> 47:12.478
-Right?
-That sucks.

47:12.645 --> 47:14.188
Do you still smoke weed?

47:14.355 --> 47:17.524
I was never really
a big weed smoker, so, no.

47:17.692 --> 47:19.359
Not weed, but...

47:20.987 --> 47:24.198
...crack.
He told me you smoked crack.

47:24.365 --> 47:26.283
Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

47:26.451 --> 47:28.660
-You told me she smoked.
-You smoke crack?

47:29.287 --> 47:33.040
No, no, my wife doesn't smoke crack.

47:33.208 --> 47:35.209
I'm sorry, dude. No, look, she only--

47:35.376 --> 47:39.046
You've only smoked it once, right?
I'm not saying you're a crackhead.

47:41.299 --> 47:43.091
Thanks, Charlie.

47:45.386 --> 47:48.555
-Babe.
-That was a secret, wasn't it?

47:49.224 --> 47:52.351
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was drunk.

47:52.519 --> 47:56.897
Great. How about you guys just go
ahead and go on to the bar, all right?

47:57.607 --> 47:58.774
-No.
-Get off me.

47:58.942 --> 48:01.735
-Don't touch me. Don't--
-Hey.

48:02.237 --> 48:05.072
Are you sure you don't want
to just come with me?

48:05.240 --> 48:08.742
No! I don't-- I'm not going.
Get off of me.

48:08.910 --> 48:10.994
You don't have to drink.

48:13.039 --> 48:17.209
I'm sure there's near beer
or something. It'll be-- It'll be fun.

48:17.377 --> 48:18.752
I'm staying in.

48:18.920 --> 48:20.462
-Oh, you're staying in.
-Yeah.

48:20.630 --> 48:23.882
Oh, you're staying in.
That sounds fun.

48:24.259 --> 48:27.553
Bye. Okay, you're going.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.097
-Goodbye.
-Just one.

48:30.348 --> 48:31.390
Babe, come on.

48:31.558 --> 48:32.933
Stop.

48:33.226 --> 48:35.602
Just go, okay?

48:35.770 --> 48:37.688
Just go.

48:37.856 --> 48:39.398
I love you.

48:39.566 --> 48:43.026
Okay.

48:45.864 --> 48:49.199
Three plus four is...?

48:49.367 --> 48:50.576
-Yes?
-Seven.

48:50.743 --> 48:54.413
Nice. Three plus five is...?

48:54.581 --> 48:57.249
Mrs. Hannah,
shouldn't you be more fatter?

48:57.625 --> 48:58.625
What?

48:58.793 --> 49:02.462
Because of the baby.
My mom got real fat.

49:05.258 --> 49:09.303
Well, the correct way
to ask that question would be:

49:09.470 --> 49:11.430
"Shouldn't you be fatter?"

49:11.598 --> 49:15.976
So when you guys are
old and wise second graders...

49:16.144 --> 49:18.645
...you will start learning
about multiplication.

49:18.813 --> 49:23.317
Mrs. Hannah,
shouldn't you be fatter?

49:27.322 --> 49:28.864
Well...

49:31.200 --> 49:33.744
...I'm not gonna have a baby.

49:36.831 --> 49:39.625
Okay, look. Look, I was pregnant...

49:39.792 --> 49:44.671
...and then it turned out it just--
It wasn't my time, I suppose, and--

49:44.839 --> 49:49.301
Mrs. Hannah, did you kill the baby?

49:49.761 --> 49:51.136
What?

49:51.304 --> 49:53.513
No, no. No, of course not.

49:53.681 --> 49:56.308
My mom said if you kill a baby,
you go to hell.

49:56.476 --> 49:59.561
And you can't even go to church
to ask God for forgiveness.

49:59.729 --> 50:01.813
Mrs. Hannah, are you going to hell?

50:01.981 --> 50:05.442
No. I did not kill my baby, and--

50:05.610 --> 50:07.611
We should not be talking about this.

50:07.946 --> 50:10.280
Sometimes
when a woman is pregnant...

50:10.740 --> 50:13.659
...she stops being pregnant
before it's even a baby.

50:13.826 --> 50:15.869
She stops being pregnant, okay?

50:16.037 --> 50:20.207
-Because a doctor murders it.
-No, not because a doctor murders it.

50:22.919 --> 50:24.419
Okay.

50:24.921 --> 50:27.214
It's called a miscarriage.

50:27.382 --> 50:29.383
And that means....

50:30.468 --> 50:32.844
It wasn't my plan.

50:33.221 --> 50:36.056
It's just what happened, okay?

50:38.059 --> 50:40.352
So does anybody
have other questions for me?

50:42.647 --> 50:46.233
All right, let's just get back
to subtraction and addition...

50:46.401 --> 50:49.486
...and all that great stuff.

50:55.201 --> 51:01.915
I gotta say, this is most likely
the most boring meal...

51:02.083 --> 51:07.004
...in the history of our planet, so....

51:07.714 --> 51:09.256
That's exciting.

51:10.008 --> 51:13.218
Right? We should celebrate.

51:15.471 --> 51:17.431
Who are you texting?

51:18.307 --> 51:19.599
Jenny.

51:19.767 --> 51:22.269
Oh, she's like a parole officer, huh?

51:23.271 --> 51:25.731
-She's my sponsor.
-Yeah.

51:25.898 --> 51:31.278
I'm just happy to know
that every little fuck-up I make...

51:31.446 --> 51:35.449
...is gonna become a topic
of conversation with some girl...

51:35.616 --> 51:38.285
...that I don't even know.

51:40.830 --> 51:42.706
Okay, baby...

51:43.499 --> 51:45.208
...how was your day?

51:45.376 --> 51:48.336
I just finished up some work.

51:48.504 --> 51:51.757
And then I met up with Owen...

51:51.924 --> 51:55.802
...and watched the game...

51:55.970 --> 51:58.055
...turned in my story.

51:58.222 --> 52:00.640
You do anything special?

52:01.976 --> 52:03.560
Well...

52:04.520 --> 52:06.480
...I lied to my class again.

52:06.647 --> 52:08.482
I told them I had a miscarriage.

52:11.152 --> 52:12.611
-It's not funny.
-No, it's--

52:12.987 --> 52:14.196
I mean, it's funny.

52:14.363 --> 52:18.992
You know, telling fucked-up things
to kids is always funny.

52:19.160 --> 52:22.788
-You know, in a fucked-up kind of way.
-Well, great.

52:22.955 --> 52:25.373
I'm just glad we're not
actually having a baby.

52:25.541 --> 52:27.250
Really, really glad.

52:27.418 --> 52:29.669
Come on, Kate.

52:31.671 --> 52:33.172
It's not that big of a deal.

52:33.340 --> 52:36.967
It's not nothing.
I lied to little kids and to my boss...

52:37.135 --> 52:39.929
...because I can't take responsibility
for my actions.

52:40.097 --> 52:43.432
All right, well, you know,
why don't you do this?

52:43.600 --> 52:46.811
Why don't you go up to the principal
and say:

52:46.978 --> 52:49.605
"You know what?
I never actually was pregnant.

52:49.773 --> 52:51.190
And the reason I puked...

52:51.358 --> 52:55.528
...was because I was up all night
drinking."

52:55.695 --> 52:58.697
Would that make you feel better
about yourself?

52:59.366 --> 53:01.992
I've thought about it
and I think that it would--

53:02.160 --> 53:07.456
It would make me feel a lot better
about myself. Yeah.

53:07.624 --> 53:11.335
Do it then, you know. Do it.

53:12.879 --> 53:16.090
I mean, I guess you don't need a job.
We can just hang out...

53:16.258 --> 53:18.717
...and make out all the time.

53:19.219 --> 53:21.720
-It'd be awesome.
-No.

53:21.888 --> 53:24.515
God, of course I don't need a job,
right?

53:24.683 --> 53:28.394
I could just stay at home, like you,
all day...

53:28.562 --> 53:33.357
-...and never do anything responsible.
-I don't ever do anything responsible?

53:33.859 --> 53:38.988
Really? What about, I don't know,
buying this house that we live in?

53:39.156 --> 53:40.948
Charlie.

53:41.908 --> 53:46.120
Having rich parents
doesn't make you responsible, okay?

53:46.288 --> 53:49.248
In fact, I think it's done the opposite.

53:49.416 --> 53:53.961
Oh, I'm sorry for having a family
that supports us.

53:54.129 --> 53:56.338
You know,
and not the other way around.

53:56.590 --> 53:58.757
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

53:59.551 --> 54:04.930
I'm just saying that you can't be
mad at me for having a family...

54:05.265 --> 54:07.725
...that has helped us out.

54:08.310 --> 54:12.104
You know, you should be grateful
that we don't have to struggle.

54:12.272 --> 54:15.983
Struggle? I wouldn't care
if we had to struggle with money...

54:16.151 --> 54:19.320
...because I have struggled
with money my whole life.

54:19.487 --> 54:22.448
I would rather worry
where my next meal is coming from...

54:22.616 --> 54:24.366
...than in some drunken stupor...

54:24.534 --> 54:27.328
...marry a man who just wants to party
and meet bands.

54:27.495 --> 54:30.623
-What are you talking about?
-About you being a baby!

54:30.790 --> 54:33.459
A selfish baby!

54:34.377 --> 54:35.961
-You know what?
-What?

54:36.129 --> 54:39.798
I fucking hate AA!

54:41.968 --> 54:45.804
It's just-- It's turned you into a bitch.

54:46.181 --> 54:50.476
A brainwashed bitch.

54:50.977 --> 54:56.148
Well, at least I'm not drunk
all the time.

55:01.821 --> 55:04.823
Everything is so fucked up
right now.

55:04.991 --> 55:08.661
I don't feel normal.

55:09.120 --> 55:12.248
Well, you're not normal.

55:12.415 --> 55:13.916
Most of us aren't.

55:14.084 --> 55:17.753
Okay, not everything is connected
to being an alcoholic.

55:19.589 --> 55:22.341
I'm not just talking about alcoholics.

55:22.509 --> 55:24.677
People are fucking weird.

55:25.011 --> 55:29.014
We all have shit that we carry in our
heads that doesn't make any sense.

55:29.641 --> 55:32.685
At least alcoholics have the tools
to work through it.

55:32.852 --> 55:37.064
Steps.

55:37.232 --> 55:39.316
And talking...

55:40.193 --> 55:43.445
...listening, crying.

55:43.613 --> 55:46.240
Yeah, I have the crying part
all worked out.

55:46.408 --> 55:48.617
I know, right?

55:50.328 --> 55:52.705
I think my first year...

55:52.872 --> 55:57.376
...I must have cried tears
I'd been saving since I was like 8.

55:59.671 --> 56:04.216
It's hard to live your life honestly,
you know?

56:05.051 --> 56:06.552
Yeah.

56:08.388 --> 56:13.392
I received a call
from a very upset parent and....

56:14.227 --> 56:17.229
Well, that's actually...

56:17.981 --> 56:19.732
...how I found out.

56:20.400 --> 56:24.737
I was surprised that you didn't feel
that you could come to me.

56:25.572 --> 56:29.908
One of the kids asked me why I wasn't
getting fat and then another one...

56:30.410 --> 56:32.536
-...asked me if I killed my baby.
-Gosh.

56:32.704 --> 56:33.912
-I just froze.
-Oh, no.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.248
Oh, my God, well....

56:36.750 --> 56:39.501
I'm so sorry
that you had to go through that.

56:39.669 --> 56:42.963
That must have been very painful
for you.

56:44.758 --> 56:46.425
Oh, my God, I feel awful.

56:46.593 --> 56:49.345
I know this is a hard time,
you have to keep going.

56:49.512 --> 56:50.679
You have to be strong.

56:50.847 --> 56:53.098
I feel so awful.
I can't keep doing this.

56:53.266 --> 56:56.685
If you wanna take a day off,
maybe through the weekend.

56:56.853 --> 56:58.729
No, I need to be honest with you.

57:01.274 --> 57:02.775
Okay.

57:08.490 --> 57:10.657
Principal Barnes...

57:13.286 --> 57:14.912
...I was never pregnant.

57:18.375 --> 57:20.793
But you vomited in class.

57:21.169 --> 57:23.921
I know. I lied. I lied to you.

57:24.089 --> 57:26.465
I lied to the class.

57:26.633 --> 57:29.385
I lied because I was scared...

57:29.552 --> 57:33.305
...and when that happened,
I panicked.

57:33.473 --> 57:35.265
-The truth...
-Oh, my God, Kate.

57:36.518 --> 57:39.311
...is something
that's really hard for....

57:40.271 --> 57:41.438
Are you really sick?

57:41.606 --> 57:44.149
No. No.

57:46.736 --> 57:48.362
What is it?

57:51.449 --> 57:52.658
I'm an alcoholic.

57:59.499 --> 58:02.000
You're--? You're an alcoholic?

58:07.757 --> 58:12.344
I'm an alcoholic, but I'm working on it.
I'm doing the steps and--

58:13.096 --> 58:16.807
When that happened, the night before,
I had been out drinking...

58:17.183 --> 58:20.519
...and I wasn't feeling too well.

58:20.687 --> 58:22.521
And so you--

58:22.689 --> 58:26.650
You vomited in front of children...

58:27.026 --> 58:29.361
...because you were hung over?

58:29.529 --> 58:31.280
Yes.

58:31.448 --> 58:35.117
And then you lied to them
and told them that you were pregnant.

58:35.285 --> 58:37.953
Well, one of the kids asked me
if I was pregnant...

58:38.121 --> 58:40.789
...and, yes,
it just sort of fell out of my mouth.

58:40.957 --> 58:44.793
Oh, naturally, of course.
Well, that makes perfect sense.

58:47.422 --> 58:49.089
I-- I'm not--

58:49.257 --> 58:53.469
I don't even know
what to say, Kate. I'm--

58:54.220 --> 58:58.724
This is sickening.
I'm extremely disappointed in you.

58:58.892 --> 59:03.312
I'm really sorry. I've been wanting
to tell you the truth for a long time.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.398
Okay? Honesty is something
really important to me now...

59:06.566 --> 59:10.402
...and I am going to meetings
and I have a sponsor--

59:10.570 --> 59:12.571
Do you know what you've done?

59:12.739 --> 59:18.202
Do you realize
how humiliating this is?

59:18.912 --> 59:20.871
What you've done...

59:21.498 --> 59:23.582
...is completely...

59:24.083 --> 59:25.709
...and utterly irresponsible.

59:25.877 --> 59:30.506
And I'm afraid that I can't have you
here at this school any longer.

01:00:12.048 --> 01:00:13.632
What do you need?

01:00:16.261 --> 01:00:17.761
Whiskey.

01:00:18.638 --> 01:00:20.264
Double.

01:00:45.664 --> 01:00:47.665
Can I get another one?

01:00:47.833 --> 01:00:49.333
Sure.

01:01:32.044 --> 01:01:33.544
Kate?

01:01:33.712 --> 01:01:36.213
Kate, are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

01:01:45.182 --> 01:01:47.767
Oh, you gotta hear this hooked up
to the speakers.

01:01:47.934 --> 01:01:49.810
It's insane.

01:01:53.398 --> 01:01:55.358
What happened to you?

01:01:56.568 --> 01:01:59.070
I'm drunk!

01:02:00.322 --> 01:02:01.864
I'm drunk.

01:02:02.032 --> 01:02:04.700
-And guess what. I'm fired.
-Oh, no.

01:02:04.868 --> 01:02:06.744
I'm fired.

01:02:07.913 --> 01:02:11.957
Hey, say, baby,
have we got any drinks in the house?

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:15.544
You know, there's some soda.

01:02:15.712 --> 01:02:17.588
Hey, babe, I can make some coffee.

01:02:17.756 --> 01:02:20.883
Oh, don't be cute with me.
You know what I mean.

01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:27.932
So you're not gonna do
the AA thing anymore, huh?

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.643
Baby, what gave that away, huh?

01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:33.521
How did you know?

01:02:36.316 --> 01:02:37.775
Oh, baby.

01:02:37.943 --> 01:02:39.860
Hey, baby, come on.

01:02:40.028 --> 01:02:43.072
Baby, let's do some shots.
Come on.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.409
Let's do some shots.

01:02:46.576 --> 01:02:48.119
What's going on?

01:02:48.286 --> 01:02:53.332
Oh, I am celebrating.
What the fuck does it look like?

01:02:53.792 --> 01:02:55.209
Hey.

01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:59.797
So, what, are you gonna be
a little girl? You gonna be a girl?

01:02:59.965 --> 01:03:02.633
Or are you gonna drink with me?

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:06.345
I don't think this is a good idea, baby.

01:03:06.513 --> 01:03:09.306
Having a beer or something
is one thing...

01:03:09.474 --> 01:03:14.061
...but I think you really may have
a problem, babe.

01:03:15.814 --> 01:03:18.023
Well, thank you, baby.
Thank you so much...

01:03:18.191 --> 01:03:22.153
...you know, for, like,
being there for me...

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.199
...when I was trying to get sober.

01:03:27.367 --> 01:03:30.995
Hey, look. Hey, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

01:03:31.163 --> 01:03:32.872
You didn't realize?

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:35.666
Oh, yeah, you didn't realize.
You know why?

01:03:35.834 --> 01:03:39.003
Because you don't fucking care
about me.

01:03:39.171 --> 01:03:40.713
What are you talking about?

01:03:40.881 --> 01:03:43.507
Hey, of course I care about you.

01:03:43.675 --> 01:03:45.885
-I love you. I love you.
-I love you.

01:03:46.052 --> 01:03:48.512
I love you, but you know what?

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.057
Love is the easy part.
Did you know that?

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:56.061
It's the rest of this shit that's hard.

01:03:56.605 --> 01:03:58.522
-Hey.
-Come on.

01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.358
-Wait.
-Take off your pants. Come on, baby.

01:04:01.526 --> 01:04:03.152
Come on, let's go.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.404
Come on, Charlie.

01:04:05.572 --> 01:04:08.407
-You should get some sleep.
-No, I don't wanna sleep.

01:04:08.575 --> 01:04:10.826
I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.
Come on.

01:04:10.994 --> 01:04:13.704
-Hey, please. Please, will you just--?
-Come on.

01:04:13.872 --> 01:04:15.206
Please.

01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:17.583
I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.
Come on.

01:04:17.751 --> 01:04:20.169
Babe. Babe, just--
This is weird, okay?

01:04:20.337 --> 01:04:24.298
-Just stop.
-Be a man and fuck your wife!

01:04:24.466 --> 01:04:28.719
No. Jesus,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:04:28.887 --> 01:04:33.557
What the fuck is wrong with me?

01:04:33.725 --> 01:04:36.852
Nothing's wrong with me.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:40.773
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You know what? Because I try hard.

01:04:41.066 --> 01:04:42.233
No, Kate.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.069
-Kate, I need you to just--
-What about me?

01:04:45.237 --> 01:04:48.531
What do I need, Charlie?
Because I can't--

01:04:48.698 --> 01:04:51.992
I can't drink
because I'm crazy or something...

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.914
...and I can't stay sober
because of you.

01:04:57.082 --> 01:04:59.750
You're blaming other people
for your problems.

01:04:59.918 --> 01:05:04.588
Go.

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:17.685
I can't be sober and be with you.

01:05:21.731 --> 01:05:24.900
At this meeting, we give cakes
to celebrate sober birthdays.

01:05:25.277 --> 01:05:29.196
We have one birthday tonight for Kate,
for one year.

01:05:29.364 --> 01:05:31.740
Jenny and Dave
are gonna give her the cake.

01:05:47.299 --> 01:05:48.883
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:50.801
I'm so proud of you.

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:53.637
-Thank you.
-Oh, honey.

01:05:53.805 --> 01:05:56.682
-You deserve this.
-Yeah.

01:05:59.019 --> 01:06:00.936
Hi. Kate, alcoholic.

01:06:01.104 --> 01:06:03.856
Hi, Kate.

01:06:06.026 --> 01:06:08.402
One of the things I've heard is that...

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:12.239
...your best day drinking
is worse than your worst day sober.

01:06:12.866 --> 01:06:16.327
Yeah, it's not true. It's not true.
I mean, I had....

01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:19.788
I had some amazing times
drinking and laughing...

01:06:19.956 --> 01:06:23.500
...and just feeling
like the most adorable...

01:06:23.668 --> 01:06:27.046
...charming girl in the world.

01:06:27.756 --> 01:06:29.465
And I was adorable. I was.

01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:32.468
I mean, I would piss my pants
and I was still cute.

01:06:34.179 --> 01:06:38.223
Well, I was in North Carolina,
Durham, playing baseball.

01:06:38.391 --> 01:06:40.100
I was-- I was getting hot.

01:06:40.268 --> 01:06:42.686
And that's when I met--

01:06:42.854 --> 01:06:45.022
When I met my girl,
my buddy Crash, here.

01:06:45.774 --> 01:06:47.691
-Crash?
-Sent him to single-A ball...

01:06:47.859 --> 01:06:49.860
...to teach me how to carry myself...

01:06:50.028 --> 01:06:51.111
-...as a pro.
-Yeah.

01:06:51.279 --> 01:06:52.738
-Yeah.
-Show you the ropes.

01:06:52.906 --> 01:06:54.281
-Show me the ropes.
-Yeah.

01:06:54.449 --> 01:06:56.659
Me and him both fell
for the same woman.

01:06:56.826 --> 01:06:59.161
-Classic.
-In the end...

01:06:59.829 --> 01:07:02.706
-...he won it. He took it.
-God.

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:04.875
That's a crazy way to meet.

01:07:05.043 --> 01:07:06.710
-Yeah, I know. It is.
-Yeah.

01:07:06.878 --> 01:07:09.922
It's really similar
to a very famous movie.

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.799
-Probably not.
-Yeah.

01:07:11.967 --> 01:07:17.054
When I first tried getting sober,
I figured that as long as I didn't drink...

01:07:17.222 --> 01:07:22.059
...everything else would just
sort of magically work itself out.

01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:24.770
But it didn't.

01:07:26.856 --> 01:07:28.065
My marriage fell apart.

01:07:28.233 --> 01:07:31.235
I lost my job.

01:07:31.903 --> 01:07:35.572
And that shit happened sober.
You know, I didn't sign up for that.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.410
I didn't read about that
in some pamphlet, you know.

01:07:41.413 --> 01:07:45.791
Another pretty shitty slogan
I've heard is...

01:07:45.959 --> 01:07:48.752
...when you're sober for a bit
and you drink again...

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.340
...the disease waits for you
and picks up where you left off.

01:07:54.426 --> 01:07:56.176
I'm gonna say it. I hate slogans.

01:07:56.344 --> 01:07:59.138
I think they sound
like bumper stickers.

01:08:01.182 --> 01:08:04.768
But that one, for me,
was pretty damn true, you know?

01:08:05.937 --> 01:08:08.147
When I drink...

01:08:09.149 --> 01:08:12.026
...I become a completely
different person.

01:08:12.193 --> 01:08:15.946
And that person
is a pretty big asshole.

01:08:16.613 --> 01:08:20.367
Unless you wanna buy me drinks or
give me drugs, and then I'm awesome.

01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:24.037
I'm sorry.

01:08:24.205 --> 01:08:29.334
You seem like a lovely girl, it's just....

01:08:30.294 --> 01:08:32.002
You have....

01:08:32.171 --> 01:08:34.839
You have really pretty hands.

01:08:35.966 --> 01:08:38.301
And you have really nice hair.

01:08:38.469 --> 01:08:40.136
Thank you.

01:08:41.138 --> 01:08:43.723
Yeah. I just....

01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:48.644
I just-- I think I'm gonna go to the....

01:08:49.979 --> 01:08:51.564
No, no, no. I'm just gonna--

01:08:51.732 --> 01:08:54.649
Hey, I'm just gonna get out.
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:08:54.818 --> 01:08:57.111
Hey, do you want a ride home?
I can....

01:08:58.488 --> 01:09:02.950
My life is a lot different now
than it was a year ago.

01:09:04.495 --> 01:09:06.496
I live alone.

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:11.000
I'm bored a lot more.

01:09:12.836 --> 01:09:14.837
I have a job that pays a lot less.

01:09:18.133 --> 01:09:21.010
But I'm so grateful...

01:09:22.095 --> 01:09:24.721
...for the friends
that I've made in here...

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:28.518
...who took the time to help me
and just to give a shit about me.

01:09:34.108 --> 01:09:37.068
And there are people
that used to be in my life...

01:09:38.612 --> 01:09:40.863
...who I miss a lot.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.573
But....

01:09:44.201 --> 01:09:45.451
Yeah, I'm so thankful.

01:09:45.618 --> 01:09:47.620
I'm so thankful...

01:09:48.372 --> 01:09:51.707
...for this boring new life of mine.

01:09:53.127 --> 01:09:55.336
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.087
Hey. How you doing?

01:10:39.047 --> 01:10:41.507
Long time, no speak.

01:10:43.177 --> 01:10:48.890
So I got into a little bit of trouble.

01:10:49.057 --> 01:10:52.768
Drunk in public on a bicycle.

01:10:54.605 --> 01:10:56.272
Yeah.

01:11:03.906 --> 01:11:06.490
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:11:07.409 --> 01:11:11.120
So you miss our house?

01:11:11.455 --> 01:11:13.289
Yeah, sometimes.

01:11:15.626 --> 01:11:16.626
You miss me?

01:11:20.797 --> 01:11:22.840
Sometimes.

01:11:26.803 --> 01:11:30.056
I'm a year sober.

01:11:30.849 --> 01:11:32.308
Really?

01:11:32.476 --> 01:11:33.935
Yeah.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.610
-They gave you this?
-Yeah.

01:11:42.778 --> 01:11:45.321
A couple days ago. Tuesday.

01:11:50.327 --> 01:11:51.661
Congratulations.

01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:55.122
It's, really, really....

01:11:55.457 --> 01:11:57.208
It's great.

01:11:58.669 --> 01:12:00.127
I mean it.

01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:09.595
So are you dating anyone?

01:12:09.763 --> 01:12:11.555
Charlie.

01:12:11.807 --> 01:12:12.848
Are you?

01:12:16.937 --> 01:12:19.272
I just keep thinking how I....

01:12:21.817 --> 01:12:25.486
I wish I was meeting you
for the first time...

01:12:26.697 --> 01:12:28.406
...in a bar.

01:12:28.865 --> 01:12:31.784
And I didn't have any
of this baggage, and....

01:12:32.869 --> 01:12:38.207
And I could buy you a drink
and flirt with you all night.

01:12:51.763 --> 01:12:54.098
Have you been playing a lot?

01:12:54.349 --> 01:12:56.225
I haven't played in over a year.

01:12:56.393 --> 01:12:58.728
Then how are you beating me so bad?

01:12:58.895 --> 01:13:01.605
I don't know. Innate talent?

01:13:02.566 --> 01:13:04.817
I haven't met anyone
vaguely interesting...

01:13:04.985 --> 01:13:07.486
...since we separated.

01:13:09.156 --> 01:13:13.576
How about we just stick to the game,
okay?

01:13:14.077 --> 01:13:16.746
-I've been masturbating a lot.
-Charlie.

01:13:16.913 --> 01:13:18.873
I miss you.

01:13:19.041 --> 01:13:21.083
Just stop.

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.338
Okay. Fine.

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:32.762
You could've been killed, you know.

01:13:33.722 --> 01:13:35.097
What?

01:13:36.099 --> 01:13:38.517
Riding your bike drunk.

01:13:38.852 --> 01:13:40.603
I worry about you.

01:13:40.979 --> 01:13:43.064
Yeah. Well, that's understandable...

01:13:43.231 --> 01:13:48.235
...because I used to worry about you
all the time, but....

01:13:48.737 --> 01:13:50.738
You know, now I don't have to.

01:13:50.989 --> 01:13:53.282
Because you're doing okay.

01:13:54.451 --> 01:13:56.118
And that makes me happy...

01:13:56.286 --> 01:13:59.955
...even though you're better off
without me.

01:14:00.374 --> 01:14:03.918
Just glad that you're doing well.

01:14:06.588 --> 01:14:12.635
Hey, would you move back in
if I came to meetings?

01:14:14.805 --> 01:14:17.640
You have to do that for you.
You can't....

01:14:17.808 --> 01:14:19.975
You can't do it to make me happy.

01:14:20.143 --> 01:14:21.811
Yeah, but would you?

01:14:25.023 --> 01:14:27.650
I'm not moving back in, Charlie.

01:14:32.948 --> 01:14:36.909
Can I at least
just take you out on a date?

01:14:42.833 --> 01:14:44.250
Okay.

01:14:45.752 --> 01:14:47.545
Last question.

01:14:48.755 --> 01:14:52.591
Can we just play one more game?

01:14:53.677 --> 01:14:56.095
You're kicking my ass
and it's embarrassing...

01:14:56.263 --> 01:15:00.850
...and I would like to have a chance
to redeem myself.

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:05.438
Please?

01:17:11.397 --> 01:17:13.773
# It's our anniversary #

01:17:15.067 --> 01:17:17.193
# I leave it ajar #

01:17:22.491 --> 01:17:24.701
# And go outside #

01:17:25.035 --> 01:17:27.912
# To look at the driveway stars #

01:17:32.376 --> 01:17:35.545
# The crickets are chirping #

01:17:35.713 --> 01:17:37.964
# They stop at my step #

01:17:42.803 --> 01:17:44.929
# I stop my step #

01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:47.932
# And they start up again #

01:17:58.611 --> 01:18:00.987
# It's our anniversary #

01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:05.074
# And the bullfrogs #

01:18:07.494 --> 01:18:10.204
# And everything that can sing #

01:18:13.042 --> 01:18:19.756
# Is singing its mating song #

01:18:29.433 --> 01:18:31.726
# The soil is steaming #

01:18:32.478 --> 01:18:34.771
# Grass is swooning #

01:18:39.735 --> 01:18:42.445
# Guns or fireworks are popping #

01:18:42.613 --> 01:18:44.697
# Down in the town #

01:18:49.828 --> 01:18:52.580
# A woman is running #

01:18:52.748 --> 01:18:54.916
# A man jumps up and down #

01:19:05.177 --> 01:19:07.553
# It's our anniversary #

01:19:10.015 --> 01:19:12.433
# And you've hidden my keys #

01:19:15.104 --> 01:19:17.563
# This is one anniversary #

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.820
# You're spending with me #

01:19:34.665 --> 01:19:36.666
# I slide in the front seat #

01:19:37.918 --> 01:19:40.211
# The driver's side #

01:19:45.175 --> 01:19:50.346
# To hot-wire and hightail
Crosses my mind #

01:19:55.185 --> 01:19:58.104
# But still in the driveway #

01:19:58.272 --> 01:20:00.606
# Fixed like stars #

01:20:10.743 --> 01:20:13.411
# I flip on the headlights #

01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:17.874
# And go back inside #

01:20:20.711 --> 01:20:22.837
# The climate's controlled #

01:20:25.048 --> 01:20:29.427
# While the battery dies #

01:20:29.595 --> 01:20:35.600
# Clipping the wings
Of your morning flight #

01:20:36.305 --> 01:20:42.316
