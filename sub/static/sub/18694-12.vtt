00:01.123 --> 00:02.756
<i>It's Mark Kovac.</i>
<i>This is our guy.</i>

00:02.791 --> 00:05.392
<i>Says here that General Josip</i>
<i>Radik was shot at long range</i>

00:05.427 --> 00:07.094
<i>during his son's</i>
<i>sixth birthday.</i>

00:07.129 --> 00:08.595
Did you kill my father,
Agent Booth?

00:09.233 --> 00:10.376
<i>There's been a shooting.</i>

00:10.400 --> 00:12.267
<i>It was the safe house</i>
<i>where we put Max</i>

00:12.302 --> 00:13.446
<i>and the kids.</i>

00:13.470 --> 00:14.836
<i>I just got a location</i>

00:14.872 --> 00:15.872
for Kovac's phone.

00:15.906 --> 00:17.906
It's in a moving car,
headed south.

00:17.941 --> 00:19.875
The FBI already dispatched
a SWAT unit.

00:19.910 --> 00:20.842
This is revenge.

00:20.878 --> 00:23.156
<i>They won't be satisfied</i>
<i>until they kill.</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:24.290
We got to get everybody
out of here.

00:24.314 --> 00:26.581
<i>The bomb is here.</i>
I know how to find Kovac.

00:26.617 --> 00:28.194
Forget about the evidence! I
have to get you somewhere safe.

00:28.218 --> 00:29.985
The door! It's closing!

00:31.755 --> 00:33.221
Booth, did you find it?

00:36.193 --> 00:37.692
What is happening?

00:37.728 --> 00:39.305
<i>The bomb is</i>
<i>on an electronic repeater!</i>

00:39.329 --> 00:41.196
Which means there's
more than one. Angie!

00:41.231 --> 00:42.430
Bones, where are you?!

01:35.485 --> 01:36.952
Angela! Angie!

01:36.987 --> 01:38.987
I'm here, I'm here.

01:46.129 --> 01:48.230
Bones.

01:49.433 --> 01:50.765
It's okay, baby.

01:50.801 --> 01:52.500
The baby! Angela, the baby.

01:52.536 --> 01:55.537
I don't, I don't know.
I don't...

01:55.572 --> 01:57.606
I don't know.

01:57.641 --> 02:01.209
Bones! Bones!

02:01.245 --> 02:03.278
Booth!
Booth!

02:03.313 --> 02:04.512
Bones!

02:05.782 --> 02:07.182
Bones!

02:07.217 --> 02:08.616
She was right here.

02:08.651 --> 02:09.550
Bones!

02:09.586 --> 02:11.453
Booth! We're here!

02:11.488 --> 02:12.554
Bones!

02:12.589 --> 02:14.055
<i>there's been</i>

02:14.091 --> 02:15.568
a massive explosion
in mid-city Washington.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.961
Reports place the blast
at the Jeffersonian Institution.

02:19.997 --> 02:21.663
Reports indicate
a series of explosions...

02:21.698 --> 02:23.164
Come on.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.167
Aubrey.
I still can't reach Booth.

02:26.203 --> 02:28.214
And he was going to the lab?
That's what he told me.

02:28.238 --> 02:30.372
I got to get down there.
I'll make sure

02:30.407 --> 02:31.973
these sweet little angels
stay safe.

02:32.009 --> 02:35.877
You make sure you bring
their parents back!

02:35.912 --> 02:37.879
Booth, Booth!

02:37.914 --> 02:40.081
Dr. B!

02:40.117 --> 02:41.049
Brennan!

02:41.084 --> 02:43.151
Bones!

02:43.186 --> 02:44.986
Brennan!

02:45.022 --> 02:47.389
Bones!

02:47.424 --> 02:49.758
I'm hearing that
both entrances collapsed,

02:49.793 --> 02:51.459
they are completely filled
with rubble.

02:51.495 --> 02:53.662
This is bad.
This is worse than bad.

02:53.697 --> 02:55.341
We can't make contact.
First responders say

02:55.365 --> 02:57.232
it's gonna take hours
to dig their way in.

02:57.267 --> 02:59.379
- Well, make them work faster.
- Okay, listen, uh,

02:59.403 --> 03:00.602
Caroline, there's more.

03:00.637 --> 03:03.004
I just got word from the team
that went after Kovac.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.272
Please tell me

03:04.308 --> 03:06.508
that son of a bitch
is either dead or in custody.

03:06.543 --> 03:07.909
And if I have a choice,

03:07.944 --> 03:09.044
I choose dead.

03:09.079 --> 03:10.812
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
that it's neither.

03:10.847 --> 03:12.247
The phone was a decoy, okay?

03:12.282 --> 03:14.449
It was taped to the bottom
of a delivery van.

03:18.088 --> 03:20.889
Bones.

03:20.924 --> 03:22.524
Booth, do you have anything?

03:22.559 --> 03:24.359
I got nothing yet!

03:24.394 --> 03:26.494
Bones!

03:29.466 --> 03:31.533
Oh. Oh, God.

03:42.245 --> 03:44.412
Okay.

03:44.448 --> 03:46.281
Easy, I got you. Oh.

03:46.316 --> 03:47.515
Right here.

03:47.551 --> 03:49.451
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

03:49.486 --> 03:51.720
Bones? There...

03:51.755 --> 03:53.221
There you are.
That's it, open up.

03:53.256 --> 03:55.690
Open your eyes. Let me see them.
I'm right here.

03:55.726 --> 03:57.726
Come on, Bones. Wake up.

03:57.761 --> 03:59.694
Temperance.

03:59.730 --> 04:01.429
Stay with me.
There you are.

04:01.465 --> 04:02.430
I'm right here.

04:02.466 --> 04:04.432
Bones. Ah, are you...

04:04.468 --> 04:06.234
Okay, all right, okay.

04:06.269 --> 04:08.403
Aubrey!

04:08.438 --> 04:10.872
They're, um...
Hey, w-where are the others?

04:10.907 --> 04:13.641
They're still inside. We tried
to go back and get them,

04:13.677 --> 04:15.062
but search and rescue
wouldn't let us in.

04:15.086 --> 04:15.978
Cam, there's nothing else

04:15.979 --> 04:18.213
we could do; we can only hope
they all got to safety.

04:18.248 --> 04:20.293
I've been trying to call. Uh, no
answer yet. Uh, maybe if you...

04:20.317 --> 04:22.428
I-I tried, too. Nothing.
- That doesn't mean anything.

04:22.452 --> 04:24.486
The signal was probably
knocked out.

04:24.521 --> 04:26.121
Right.

04:27.457 --> 04:29.657
Right.

04:35.098 --> 04:36.865
Are Christine
and Hank okay?

04:36.900 --> 04:38.711
No, no, hold on.
Just don't move. They're safe.

04:38.735 --> 04:40.268
They're safe.
They're back at the FBI.

04:40.303 --> 04:41.803
All right? They're safe.

04:45.675 --> 04:47.142
I feel different.

04:47.177 --> 04:48.910
That was a
huge explosion.

04:48.945 --> 04:50.812
Three bombs, maybe more.

04:50.847 --> 04:52.280
If Booth hadn't
defused the one

04:52.315 --> 04:54.349
under the platform,
we'd all be dead.

04:54.384 --> 04:57.652
Cam and Arastoo got out, and
they're going to bring help.

04:57.687 --> 04:59.053
I was looking at something.

04:59.089 --> 05:00.989
What was that?
It doesn't matter, Bones.

05:01.024 --> 05:02.991
No, Booth, this is important.

05:03.026 --> 05:04.626
I need to kn...

05:04.661 --> 05:06.928
I need-- What was I doing

05:06.963 --> 05:09.397
before the explosion?

05:09.433 --> 05:10.799
I think you were
in your office.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.745
- What are we working on?
- We're working on

05:12.769 --> 05:13.701
Fred Walden's remains.

05:13.737 --> 05:14.936
I mean, he's the prisoner

05:14.971 --> 05:16.237
that escaped with Kovac.

05:16.273 --> 05:18.440
Something about Kovac--
you knew how to find him.

05:21.711 --> 05:23.711
What is it?

05:23.747 --> 05:27.549
Femur, scapula,

05:27.584 --> 05:29.651
ulna, mandible.

05:31.521 --> 05:33.455
I don't know what that means.

05:33.490 --> 05:34.889
Yes, yes, you do.

05:34.925 --> 05:36.357
Th-They're bones.

05:36.393 --> 05:37.792
I know.

05:37.828 --> 05:39.727
I-I just don't understand
their significance.

05:39.763 --> 05:41.496
Well, it doesn't matter.

05:41.531 --> 05:43.231
You'll figure it out later.
No, Booth!

05:43.266 --> 05:46.301
Something is wrong with me.

06:31.912 --> 06:33.512
It would take hours
to clear a path.

06:33.547 --> 06:35.047
There's got to be another way.

06:39.553 --> 06:41.820
Listen, other than
the basement access,

06:41.856 --> 06:43.656
these are the only two exits
in the lab.

06:43.691 --> 06:44.691
Ironically, for safety.

06:44.725 --> 06:46.191
I'm not
buying that, okay?

06:46.227 --> 06:47.504
There's got to be
something else--

06:47.528 --> 06:49.094
a ventilation shaft,
a heating duct.

06:49.130 --> 06:50.707
There's-there's got to
be something. Think.

06:50.731 --> 06:52.331
Booth, a bomb went off

06:52.366 --> 06:53.910
in one of the biggest
public institutions

06:53.934 --> 06:55.334
in all of D.C.,
all right?

06:55.369 --> 06:57.369
Rescue teams have
got to already

06:57.405 --> 06:59.238
be on their way!
All right, listen.

06:59.273 --> 07:01.051
I'm sorry, but do you hear
anything? 'Cause I don't!

07:01.075 --> 07:02.107
I don't hear any drilling

07:02.143 --> 07:03.575
or any rescue attempt,
so come on!

07:03.611 --> 07:05.477
Let's go!
Help me with this stuff.

07:05.513 --> 07:06.679
Damn it.

07:06.714 --> 07:07.980
<i>Hodgins and Booth</i>

07:08.015 --> 07:09.882
are-are trying
to find a way out,

07:09.917 --> 07:11.884
and I managed
to score us some water

07:11.919 --> 07:14.420
from one of
the tech stations.

07:14.455 --> 07:15.954
What are those for?

07:15.990 --> 07:17.923
Oh, uh, Hodgins says that,

07:17.958 --> 07:21.093
uh, a stethoscope and a beaker,
used together,

07:21.128 --> 07:24.830
are almost as accurate
as a fetal Doppler, so...

07:24.865 --> 07:26.565
Really?

07:26.600 --> 07:28.567
Yeah.

07:28.602 --> 07:30.135
You taught him that.

07:32.006 --> 07:33.605
Okay, lie down.

07:42.016 --> 07:45.317
He said you put the stethoscope
under the beaker,

07:45.352 --> 07:47.786
and it amplifies the sound.

07:56.897 --> 07:59.064
Anything?

07:59.100 --> 08:01.867
Th-This is not the
appropriate device.

08:01.902 --> 08:03.936
I-I'm not a medical doctor.

08:03.971 --> 08:06.038
I'm not processing
with my usual...

08:06.073 --> 08:08.674
So you're saying
you can't find it?

08:08.709 --> 08:10.843
No, not yet.

08:19.086 --> 08:21.053
What?

08:21.088 --> 08:23.188
What is it?

08:26.026 --> 08:28.127
Listen.

08:42.143 --> 08:43.609
What is that?
That's the other bomb.

08:43.644 --> 08:44.910
What-- I thought
you defused it.

08:44.945 --> 08:46.645
Yeah, well, I did,
but you know what,

08:46.680 --> 08:49.381
maybe we could use it
to spark it back up

08:49.416 --> 08:51.617
and blow ourselves right out of
this wall, right here.

08:51.652 --> 08:54.586
Come on. Come over here and
help me get this thing going.

08:54.622 --> 08:56.166
Yeah, I would love nothing more,
but unfortunately,

08:56.190 --> 08:57.834
this building is not gonna
survive another blast.

08:57.858 --> 09:00.526
Stop! Do you understand me?
Stop. You-you saw Bones.

09:00.561 --> 09:02.528
She's got some kind of
a-a head trauma.

09:02.563 --> 09:04.429
She could be bleeding
in the brain.

09:04.465 --> 09:06.209
I watched my pregnant wife
get thrown against a wall!

09:06.233 --> 09:08.500
All right? You're not the only
one who wants out of here!

09:08.536 --> 09:10.836
Then come on over here and
help me get this thing going.

09:10.871 --> 09:12.905
You're not listening, Booth!
It's too risky!

09:12.940 --> 09:14.740
You were trained in munitions!

09:14.775 --> 09:17.709
You know this!
You don't have to be a hero!

09:29.390 --> 09:31.957
I don't need a shrink right now.
You understand me?

09:31.992 --> 09:34.393
I just...

09:34.428 --> 09:36.962
I just got to get out of here.

09:46.273 --> 09:48.841
Listen.

09:48.876 --> 09:50.642
Booth, I...

09:52.112 --> 09:54.546
I know I've said a lot of things
over the years

09:54.582 --> 09:56.281
about you being a sniper.

09:58.452 --> 10:00.452
I was wrong.

10:00.487 --> 10:03.822
Killing Kovac's father--

10:03.858 --> 10:06.725
that was the right thing to do.

10:11.799 --> 10:13.899
You hear that?

10:16.370 --> 10:17.769
Hey!

10:17.805 --> 10:19.338
We're in here!

10:24.979 --> 10:26.879
Anyone in here?!

10:26.914 --> 10:29.281
Anybody alive?

10:29.316 --> 10:31.316
I see somebody!
We got movement!

10:31.352 --> 10:33.452
Hey!

10:37.157 --> 10:38.290
Hey, hey, hey!

10:38.325 --> 10:39.291
Cam, look!

10:39.326 --> 10:40.759
Oh, my...

10:40.794 --> 10:42.094
Thank God
you're alive.

10:42.129 --> 10:43.929
Hank and Christine?

10:43.964 --> 10:45.208
Th-They're safe;
they're at the FBI

10:45.232 --> 10:46.343
with Caroline till we get Kovac.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.866
Which means you
don't have him yet.

10:48.969 --> 10:50.046
You need to sit down. Come on.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.037
- He was right next to me.
- Just see them.

10:52.072 --> 10:55.007
I'm happy the little guy's okay.

10:55.042 --> 10:58.143
How do you know it's a guy?

10:58.178 --> 11:00.379
Just got a feeling.

11:00.414 --> 11:02.648
Okay, Dr. Brennan,

11:02.683 --> 11:04.416
close your eyes. Now,

11:04.451 --> 11:07.519
I'm gonna touch one of your
fingers, and you try to touch

11:07.554 --> 11:09.399
the corresponding finger on your
other hand with your thumb.

11:09.423 --> 11:11.156
Okay?

11:20.034 --> 11:22.868
So I'm just gonna go over some
results with the neurologist,

11:22.903 --> 11:24.836
and be right back.

11:27.207 --> 11:29.174
Bones?

11:29.209 --> 11:31.376
What's going on?
I don't know.

11:31.412 --> 11:33.545
What do you mean you don't know?

11:33.580 --> 11:35.058
What-what... what did he say?
What did the doctor say?

11:35.082 --> 11:37.416
I-I don't...
I don't know.

11:37.451 --> 11:40.152
Cam, what's going on?

11:40.187 --> 11:43.055
The good news is, the CT shows
there's no internal bleeding.

11:43.090 --> 11:44.856
But?

11:44.892 --> 11:47.492
You have a contusion
on your corpus callosum.

11:47.528 --> 11:49.194
That's the structure

11:49.229 --> 11:51.207
that allows the two hemispheres
of the brain to communicate.

11:51.231 --> 11:52.931
I'm sorry. What does that mean
exactly?

11:52.967 --> 11:54.244
Well, it means
Brennan's memories

11:54.268 --> 11:55.467
haven't been compromised,

11:55.502 --> 11:58.370
but, rather, her ability
to process complex information.

12:00.307 --> 12:01.353
I-I have to get back to work.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.760
Dr. Vaziri, stay close
in case I need anything.

12:03.761 --> 12:04.830
No way. You need to rest.

12:04.854 --> 12:08.412
No. Booth, the key to catching
Kovac is inside that lab.

12:08.883 --> 12:10.115
The longer we're out here,

12:10.151 --> 12:11.116
the more time he has

12:11.152 --> 12:13.786
to plan his next move.

12:13.821 --> 12:16.288
I need to get
into the bone room.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.992
So what's the big plan?

12:20.027 --> 12:22.862
Well, these four bones are
the key to catching Kovac.

12:22.897 --> 12:25.231
I'll start there.
Okay, easy. Coming in.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.333
All right, guys, thanks.
Let's go.

12:27.368 --> 12:28.601
Move through it.

12:28.636 --> 12:30.936
Man, are you kidding me?

12:30.972 --> 12:32.872
Whoa.

12:32.907 --> 12:37.076
Oh. The blast emptied out
all the bone storage drawers.

12:37.111 --> 12:40.312
It appears
I'll need Dr. Vaziri's help.

12:40.348 --> 12:42.047
Not just Arastoo.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.884
You're gonna need all the help
that you can get.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.056
<i>Hey, I came as soon as I heard.</i>

12:53.057 --> 12:54.290
Is Dr. Brennan okay?

12:54.325 --> 12:55.736
Well, we just got to
wait. You know, right?

12:55.760 --> 12:57.059
The lab is...
It's-it's a mess.

12:57.095 --> 12:58.628
But it's usable,
and she's there now.

12:58.663 --> 13:00.329
Well, if there's anything
I can do.

13:00.365 --> 13:02.098
There is.
We've still got a killer

13:02.133 --> 13:03.790
and his bomb-happy
accomplice to find.

13:03.814 --> 13:05.002
Kovac had an accomplice?

13:05.003 --> 13:07.136
Well, he was in prison
two nights ago, right?

13:07.172 --> 13:08.871
So he didn't
set off those bombs.

13:08.907 --> 13:10.673
What about security
<i>inside</i> the Jeffersonian?

13:10.708 --> 13:13.643
No. Everything between 2:00
and 3:00 a.m. has been deleted.

13:13.678 --> 13:16.078
This guy is methodical.
Which means it's

13:16.114 --> 13:17.947
high time we all consider
joining Aubrey

13:17.982 --> 13:21.250
in Los Angeles. Maybe Judge Judy
needs a prosecutor.

13:21.286 --> 13:22.663
There's no way I'm running.
Tell you what.

13:22.687 --> 13:24.187
Go get Kovac's ex-wife.

13:24.222 --> 13:25.888
No. You think
she's involved with this?

13:25.924 --> 13:27.223
I-I saw her interview tape.

13:27.258 --> 13:28.791
She looked terrified of him.

13:28.827 --> 13:30.760
Well, she's still our
best link to finding him.

13:30.795 --> 13:32.929
Oh, wow.
Oh, this is...

13:32.964 --> 13:36.199
- This is definitely not good.
- Oh.

13:36.234 --> 13:39.435
Yeah. My servers
are completely destroyed.

13:39.471 --> 13:41.337
But you have backups, right?

13:41.372 --> 13:43.440
I mean, you uploaded everything
into the cloud?

13:43.441 --> 13:45.976
You've been
lecturing me endlessly for years

13:46.010 --> 13:47.510
about how the cloud
isn't secure.

13:47.545 --> 13:49.145
Wait a minute.
You listened to me?

13:49.180 --> 13:52.014
Angela, I'm a known
paranoid conspiracy theorist.

13:52.050 --> 13:53.516
I did.

13:53.551 --> 13:57.320
That's why I brought... this.

13:57.355 --> 14:01.157
What's...?
What's with the key?

14:10.902 --> 14:12.735
What is that, Angie?

14:12.770 --> 14:16.172
You know those black box
recorders on airplanes?

14:16.207 --> 14:17.874
This is my version.

14:17.909 --> 14:20.510
It's a steel frame
box with layers

14:20.545 --> 14:22.545
of paraffin
and insulation inside.

14:22.580 --> 14:27.183
And it contains a full backup
copy of every file in this lab.

14:27.218 --> 14:29.952
You <i>did</i> listen to me.

14:30.955 --> 14:33.422
Don't let it go to your head.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.291
We should get to work.

14:46.905 --> 14:50.573
Dr. Brennan, look at
this sternal rib end.

14:50.608 --> 14:54.877
The bone is smooth, but the
contour is indented, which means

14:54.913 --> 14:58.214
the age is between 20 and 29,
same as our victim.

14:58.249 --> 15:01.384
Yes. Good work, Ms. Warren.

15:01.419 --> 15:03.786
I concur.
Except, look.

15:03.821 --> 15:07.356
It's also sharp
with irregular projections.

15:07.392 --> 15:09.692
I... don't remember
what that means.

15:09.727 --> 15:11.327
It's okay.

15:11.362 --> 15:12.995
It-it just means
that this rib doesn't

15:13.031 --> 15:13.762
belong to our victim.

15:13.786 --> 15:15.465
This is impossible.
There must be

15:15.466 --> 15:17.066
at least 200 different sets of

15:17.101 --> 15:18.913
- remains on the floor.
- It's like excavating

15:18.937 --> 15:21.737
a mass grave.
No, Mr. Bray.

15:21.773 --> 15:24.507
I can assure you, this is
nothing compared to a mass

15:24.542 --> 15:25.875
burial site.

15:25.910 --> 15:27.343
In Guatemala,
in Coban,

15:27.378 --> 15:29.779
I helped exhume over 500

15:29.814 --> 15:31.981
sets of remains,
all innocent

15:32.016 --> 15:33.683
victims of their civil war,

15:33.718 --> 15:38.387
their wrists still tied,
blindfolds over their eyes.

15:38.423 --> 15:41.090
I'm sorry, Dr. Brennan. What
a horrible thing to witness.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.525
You remember that
so clearly.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.493
Does that mean
you're doing better?

15:44.529 --> 15:46.128
I don't know. I...

15:46.164 --> 15:47.830
I mean, I do remember things.

15:47.865 --> 15:52.034
I mean... I-I remember
watching Cam propose to you,

15:52.070 --> 15:54.503
how happy you looked.

15:56.074 --> 15:59.508
I remember that you used
to carry a cigarette

15:59.544 --> 16:01.377
behind your ear to

16:01.412 --> 16:02.878
remind you of your father.

16:02.914 --> 16:06.115
I remember... how

16:06.150 --> 16:08.651
proud you were when your book

16:08.686 --> 16:11.821
was published, even though
I found it to be rather mawkish.

16:11.856 --> 16:13.689
And I remember you

16:13.725 --> 16:15.324
teaching me how to chirp.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.826
Tweet.

16:16.861 --> 16:19.161
Tweet.

16:19.197 --> 16:21.330
And I remember....

16:21.366 --> 16:23.666
fighting off attackers
with you by

16:23.701 --> 16:25.301
my side.
In the Maluku Islands.

16:25.336 --> 16:27.003
I meant the motorcycle bar,
but yes.

16:27.038 --> 16:30.006
The Maluku Islands, as well.

16:30.041 --> 16:32.208
I remember

16:32.243 --> 16:35.845
the day each of you was hired.

16:35.880 --> 16:39.181
I remember the name
of every victim

16:39.217 --> 16:42.318
I've ever identified.

16:42.353 --> 16:46.055
I remember... just how
meaningful this work can be,

16:46.090 --> 16:48.157
but I... I don't remember how...

16:48.192 --> 16:49.959
to do it.

16:49.994 --> 16:52.628
I mean...

16:52.664 --> 16:54.764
I can't make sense
of the evidence.

16:54.799 --> 16:57.133
I don't even...

16:57.168 --> 17:00.102
know what I'm supposed
to do with this.

17:08.246 --> 17:09.645
Cam.

17:09.681 --> 17:11.714
Good. Look at this.

17:11.749 --> 17:14.282
Is that an explosive from
the bomb Booth defused?

17:14.318 --> 17:15.951
It is, and whoever devised it

17:15.987 --> 17:18.654
mixed some kind of HMX explosive
with a binder material,

17:18.690 --> 17:20.122
most likely some kind of, like,

17:20.157 --> 17:22.558
ethyl silicate resin.
That way,

17:22.593 --> 17:23.903
the material itself
could be molded

17:23.904 --> 17:25.094
into whatever shape
was needed.

17:25.117 --> 17:27.030
Yeah, well,
I'm seeing fingerprints.

17:27.031 --> 17:28.442
Unfortunately, the bad news is,
they're all partials.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.833
Nothing we can use to ID.

17:30.868 --> 17:32.146
However, it also indicates
that the person

17:32.170 --> 17:33.736
who was actually
molding this explosive

17:33.771 --> 17:35.671
was using
their bare hands.

17:35.707 --> 17:37.406
So there might
be epithelials.

17:37.442 --> 17:38.974
Our bomber's DNA.

17:39.010 --> 17:41.010
Yeah.

17:41.045 --> 17:42.812
Listen to me, Mrs. Kovac,

17:42.847 --> 17:45.314
I'm only gonna ask you
one last time. Where is he?

17:45.349 --> 17:46.667
I told you. I don't
know where he is.

17:46.691 --> 17:47.584
No, no, no. No.

17:47.585 --> 17:49.351
No, no. Your husband
calling your phone--

17:49.387 --> 17:50.720
okay, that was a setup.

17:50.755 --> 17:53.155
Look, I know what
you've been through.

17:53.191 --> 17:54.920
I saw the explosion
on the news.

17:54.944 --> 17:55.892
You know more

17:55.893 --> 17:57.728
than what you're telling us,
and you're hiding someone.

17:57.752 --> 17:58.261
What?

17:58.262 --> 18:01.263
You're hiding someone.
No! I am not! I swear to you.

18:01.299 --> 18:02.665
Agent Booth,

18:02.700 --> 18:04.066
two months ago, I found out

18:04.102 --> 18:06.502
my husband's real identity.
Listen

18:06.537 --> 18:07.903
to me, Jeannine.

18:07.939 --> 18:09.316
This is my last offer
to make a deal.

18:09.340 --> 18:11.407
I leave this room,
and it's over.

18:12.610 --> 18:15.444
I swear to you,
I don't know anything

18:15.480 --> 18:17.513
about what Mark has done,

18:17.548 --> 18:19.982
or what he's planning
to do next.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.518
You willing to prove that?

18:29.327 --> 18:31.861
Hey, how's it
going in there?

18:31.896 --> 18:33.929
Slowly.

18:33.965 --> 18:36.298
Were you able to find
any more medio-cam images?

18:36.334 --> 18:40.970
Um.... no more
than I already gave you.

18:42.340 --> 18:43.939
They haven't helped
trigger anything?

18:43.975 --> 18:47.309
No.

18:47.345 --> 18:49.445
Are those photos
from Cam's wedding?

18:49.480 --> 18:51.380
They're from
the reception.

18:51.415 --> 18:53.315
Since we know that Cam's ID was

18:53.351 --> 18:54.928
probably stolen from there,
I thought it might

18:54.952 --> 18:56.552
help us find
something.

18:58.623 --> 19:00.089
That's weird.

19:00.124 --> 19:01.824
Isn't that one
of the waiters?

19:01.859 --> 19:04.727
Yeah, except
he's carrying Cam's purse.

19:04.762 --> 19:06.295
I think this could

19:06.330 --> 19:08.697
possibly be the accomplice
that we're looking for.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.316
When's the last time that
you spoke to your husband?

19:12.387 --> 19:15.310
I spoke to Mark yesterday
in the morning.

19:15.311 --> 19:16.066
He called.

19:16.090 --> 19:17.812
And, uh, did he say
where he was going?

19:17.813 --> 19:20.447
I have no idea
where my husband is.

19:20.482 --> 19:22.882
Well, there's somebody out
there who's been helping him.

19:22.918 --> 19:25.819
Believe me, if I knew
who was helping my husband,

19:25.854 --> 19:28.054
I would tell you.

19:28.090 --> 19:30.590
Well, she doesn't have any tells
to indicate that she's lying.

19:30.626 --> 19:32.058
I don't see anything, either.

19:32.094 --> 19:35.095
Maybe the polygraph will
show us something different.

19:36.198 --> 19:38.064
What do you got?
She passed.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.866
Not even a gray area.
All right.

19:39.901 --> 19:41.112
Just hold her.
I don't care how.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.580
Just keep digging.
Do you understand me?

19:42.604 --> 19:45.171
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

19:45.207 --> 19:46.673
What-what is it?

19:46.708 --> 19:48.608
Uh, the fake waiter
who stole Cam's pass--

19:48.644 --> 19:51.044
we got an ID.
I'm coming with you.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.300
Whoa.

20:13.335 --> 20:14.934
Where did everybody go?

20:14.970 --> 20:16.870
Well, I thought
I might be able to make

20:16.905 --> 20:19.339
more progress
if I were alone with the bones,

20:19.374 --> 20:23.076
but... I still can't
make sense of this.

20:23.111 --> 20:25.478
Okay, just go easy
on yourself, okay?

20:25.514 --> 20:28.248
It'll-it'll come back to you.

20:28.283 --> 20:30.317
Is that an X-ray machine?
Yeah.

20:30.352 --> 20:32.619
Hodgins and I were able
to recalibrate it.

20:32.654 --> 20:34.487
The interns thought
that you could use it

20:34.523 --> 20:36.222
to match these bones
to pre-existing x-rays

20:36.258 --> 20:37.691
of the victim's skeleton,

20:37.726 --> 20:40.460
to make sure you've got
the right ones.

20:40.495 --> 20:42.162
Yeah, you-you know,
it was just

20:42.197 --> 20:43.005
a crazy idea.

20:43.029 --> 20:45.608
No. No, it was
an obvious one.

20:46.234 --> 20:49.502
Fundamental... really.

20:49.538 --> 20:52.639
And I still couldn't grasp it.

20:54.409 --> 20:55.775
So, this is our guy.

20:55.811 --> 20:57.520
This is who stole Cam's ID.

20:57.544 --> 20:59.731
Kyle Capoun, 28, low-level
drug dealer.

20:59.732 --> 21:01.115
How long has this guy been dead?

21:01.149 --> 21:02.960
- Less than 48 hours.
- Listen, the file shows

21:02.984 --> 21:06.252
no history of violence.
Not only that. He flunked

21:06.288 --> 21:07.665
- high school chemistry.
- I don't think

21:07.689 --> 21:09.122
this guy's our bomber.

21:09.157 --> 21:10.857
So, someone,
someone actually

21:10.892 --> 21:12.292
working for Kovac hires

21:12.327 --> 21:15.095
this guy to steal Cam's ID
and killed him.

21:15.130 --> 21:16.908
Whoever that someone is--
they're still

21:16.932 --> 21:18.331
out there.

21:25.741 --> 21:27.474
Hey, you okay?

21:28.377 --> 21:30.243
Where are the kids?

21:30.278 --> 21:31.745
Agent Karasik-- he

21:31.780 --> 21:33.847
took 'em to the cafeteria
to get something to eat.

21:33.882 --> 21:35.715
Do you want to see 'em?

21:35.751 --> 21:38.118
Yes. No.

21:39.855 --> 21:42.122
I don't want
to worry them.

21:42.157 --> 21:44.090
You okay? Hey.

21:44.126 --> 21:45.358
It's okay.

21:45.394 --> 21:46.860
I know.

21:46.895 --> 21:48.661
I just want to see you.

21:49.965 --> 21:52.432
It's not coming back,
Booth. It's not.

21:53.335 --> 21:55.135
All right, Bones, look,

21:55.170 --> 21:57.003
you got to give it some time,
all right?

21:57.038 --> 22:00.407
I know guys from the service who
have lost their memory, okay,

22:00.442 --> 22:01.900
and it comes back.

22:01.924 --> 22:03.344
No, this is not
just a simple case

22:03.345 --> 22:06.579
of amnesia-- it...
my brain, it's...

22:06.615 --> 22:08.214
it's different.

22:08.250 --> 22:11.217
I mean, I'm... I'm different.

22:11.253 --> 22:13.019
Look, you know what?

22:13.054 --> 22:15.288
You're healing, all right?
You're gonna get better.

22:15.323 --> 22:16.589
What if I don't?

22:16.625 --> 22:18.491
I mean, so much of my life,

22:18.527 --> 22:20.960
my intelligence
is all I've had.

22:20.996 --> 22:22.162
You know, I...

22:22.197 --> 22:24.297
I may not have
had a family,

22:24.332 --> 22:27.233
but I understood things
that nobody else could.

22:27.269 --> 22:31.671
My... my brain, the way
I think, is who I <i>am.</i>

22:31.706 --> 22:34.641
Who I was. I...

22:34.676 --> 22:37.944
Now I-I don't
know, I'm...

22:37.979 --> 22:39.546
I don't know anything, Booth.

22:39.581 --> 22:42.749
I mean...

22:42.784 --> 22:47.153
If the thing that made me... me

22:47.189 --> 22:49.722
is gone...

22:49.758 --> 22:51.891
who am I?

22:57.065 --> 22:59.365
You're the woman I love.

22:59.401 --> 23:01.668
You're the one who kissed me
outside of a pool house

23:01.703 --> 23:03.903
when it was pouring rain.

23:03.939 --> 23:07.574
You took me to shoot Tommy guns
on Valentine's Day.

23:07.609 --> 23:09.576
That's who you are.

23:09.611 --> 23:12.178
You're the one
who proposed to me

23:12.214 --> 23:14.113
with a stick of beef jerky
in her hand,

23:14.149 --> 23:16.216
even though you're a vegetarian.

23:16.251 --> 23:20.587
You're the Roxie to my Tony,
and... the Wanda

23:20.622 --> 23:22.188
to my Buck.

23:22.224 --> 23:23.656
Who else is gonna sing

23:23.692 --> 23:25.291
"Hot Blooded" with me?

23:25.327 --> 23:26.759
Hmm?

23:26.795 --> 23:28.394
And besides...

23:28.430 --> 23:30.697
...we're way better
than Mulder and Scully.

23:30.732 --> 23:33.132
I don't know what that means.

23:33.168 --> 23:34.400
I don't care
if you know about

23:34.436 --> 23:36.035
the bones or...

23:36.071 --> 23:39.072
if we know
how to solve crimes.

23:39.107 --> 23:42.442
All I know is that I want
to spend the rest of my life

23:42.477 --> 23:44.277
with you.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.780
This is you.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.284
Temperance Brennan.

23:52.888 --> 23:54.087
You.

23:54.122 --> 23:55.922
You're my partner.

23:55.957 --> 23:57.724
Don't forget that.

24:01.263 --> 24:03.496
Hey.

24:03.532 --> 24:05.532
Hey, I think we got something.

24:05.567 --> 24:09.035
Not yet. It's
just a partial.

24:09.070 --> 24:11.471
Am I reading that right?
I think so.

24:11.506 --> 24:12.705
Let's run the DNA again.

24:12.741 --> 24:14.340
There must have been a mistake.

24:22.183 --> 24:24.684
Thank you.

24:26.755 --> 24:28.488
Hey, Cam.

24:28.523 --> 24:30.557
So, we were able to isolate

24:30.592 --> 24:31.391
the bomber's DNA.

24:31.426 --> 24:32.525
Any matches in the system?

24:32.561 --> 24:33.638
- Not exactly.
- What does that mean?

24:33.662 --> 24:34.739
It was a partial match,

24:34.763 --> 24:36.362
for Kovac.

24:36.398 --> 24:37.742
Since Kovac didn't escape until
What?

24:37.766 --> 24:39.710
after the bombs were set,
there must be a relative

24:39.734 --> 24:41.401
we don't know about.
The DNA was female.

24:41.436 --> 24:42.368
A mother,

24:42.404 --> 24:44.037
a sister.
It's Jeannine.

24:44.072 --> 24:46.306
His wife? Do you think
she was hiding someone?

24:46.341 --> 24:47.840
That's how she passed
the polygraph.

24:47.876 --> 24:49.275
I mean, look at her answers.

24:49.311 --> 24:51.611
"No, I have no idea
where my <i>husband</i> is."

24:51.646 --> 24:52.790
Wh-What's going on?
It's Jeannine.

24:52.814 --> 24:54.314
Kovac is not her husband.

24:54.349 --> 24:55.782
He's her brother.

24:59.016 --> 25:00.716
Excuse me.
Sorry.

25:00.751 --> 25:03.185
It was you. It was you!

25:03.220 --> 25:04.631
Whoa! What? Agent Booth,
It's all right.

25:04.655 --> 25:06.733
- Sit down. Lose the act.
- what... what's happening?

25:06.757 --> 25:07.424
I'm here to help.

25:07.425 --> 25:09.425
I told you I don't know
where my husband is.

25:09.461 --> 25:11.594
All right,
how about your brother?

25:12.897 --> 25:14.375
- What are you talking about?
- Stop lying!

25:14.399 --> 25:16.566
We know Mark Kovac is
your biological sibling.

25:16.601 --> 25:17.734
That's sick.

25:17.769 --> 25:19.902
You're accusing me of incest?

25:19.938 --> 25:22.183
No, we're accusing you of murder,
and that's just for starters.

25:22.207 --> 25:24.841
We found your DNA on the explosive.
The whole marriage thing,

25:24.876 --> 25:26.087
that was a cover--
almost worked,

25:26.111 --> 25:27.810
but it didn't.
You've been working with him

25:27.846 --> 25:28.846
this whole time!

25:28.880 --> 25:30.380
You plotted to kill me

25:30.415 --> 25:31.692
- and my children!
- All right, all right.

25:31.716 --> 25:33.449
You murdered my father!

25:33.485 --> 25:37.754
Really? Your father's blood
is on your husband's hands.

25:38.472 --> 25:40.238
So now you know
how it feels

25:40.274 --> 25:44.309
to have your father murdered
right in front of you.

25:44.345 --> 25:46.145
My husband was doing
his duty.

25:46.146 --> 25:47.645
Hiding behind patriotism...

25:47.680 --> 25:49.246
Stop! Stop.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.949
Tell us where your brother is,
and no one else has to die.

25:56.522 --> 25:58.422
We found something
odd in the remains.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.723
Several of the bones

25:59.759 --> 26:01.992
feel lighter than normal.
And get this--

26:02.027 --> 26:04.056
they're the same bones that
were on Dr. Brennan's list.

26:04.057 --> 26:06.076
And you're hoping that
if Brennan sees this evidence

26:06.100 --> 26:07.332
then she's gonna recall
what happened.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.398
Exactly.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.134
Yeah. It's just,

26:10.169 --> 26:11.668
it's not gonna work.
- Excuse me?

26:11.704 --> 26:14.571
Brennan isn't Brennan
anymore, all right?

26:14.607 --> 26:16.774
And we just... we
have to accept it.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.510
I mean, maybe someday...
So we're just supposed

26:19.545 --> 26:21.145
- to give up on her?
- I refuse

26:21.180 --> 26:22.579
to do that.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.915
Dr. Brennan saw something
in these remains.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.316
Okay.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.685
Then it's up to you
to find it.

26:28.721 --> 26:33.557
Look, Brennan trained you
for this exact moment.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.893
She's counting on you.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.328
So am I.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.633
Hodgins is right.

26:42.668 --> 26:44.880
We need to channel everything
Dr. Brennan has ever taught us.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.037
Okay, so let's assume that
Dr. Brennan wrote that note

26:47.072 --> 26:49.573
because she noticed the anomaly
in the bones' weight.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.509
What if the bone loss was due
to some kind of malformation

26:52.545 --> 26:54.344
- as a child?
- I remember a case

26:54.380 --> 26:56.079
Dr. Brennan and I worked on,
there was

26:56.115 --> 26:57.926
bone loss due to lead poisoning.
It's possible,

26:57.950 --> 27:01.218
- but why would that be significant?
- Hang on. What is...?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.287
Well, it could be dirt.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.688
It's a mark.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.089
Left lateral incisor.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.958
Sometimes
Dr. B marks a spot

27:07.993 --> 27:09.426
when she wants enamel taken.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.273
She was going to do
a histological analysis

27:11.297 --> 27:13.263
to find out where
the victim lived as a child.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.332
Okay, so childhood home,
lead poisoning.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.900
That's it.
The victim wasn't chosen

27:16.936 --> 27:18.735
at random--
he had to have provided

27:18.771 --> 27:20.404
something Kovac needed.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.573
- What did he need?
- A place to hide.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.541
Kovac has been
completely off the grid

27:24.577 --> 27:26.488
ever since he escaped from prison.
What if our victim knew

27:26.512 --> 27:28.456
a place back where he grew up?
That's why Kovac chose him

27:28.480 --> 27:30.058
to escape with, but once
Kovac got that information...

27:30.082 --> 27:32.482
He killed him.
That's what Dr. Brennan realized.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.219
And once we find out
where the victim grew up, we find Kovac.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.989
New equipment?

27:39.024 --> 27:40.791
Whoa.

27:40.826 --> 27:43.894
Seriously? What exhibit did
you guys steal this from?

27:43.929 --> 27:45.829
No. Actually,

27:45.865 --> 27:47.898
it was all donated
from the bio-chem department

27:47.933 --> 27:50.400
at Georgetown-- they came
calling almost immediately

27:50.436 --> 27:52.469
after the bomb went off.
Squints

27:52.504 --> 27:55.005
of the world unite, baby.
So...

27:55.040 --> 27:56.907
what are the results?
Were the interns right?

27:56.942 --> 27:58.375
Well, we've got
high levels

27:58.410 --> 28:00.644
of lead, arsenic and PCB,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.679
which actually
will weaken the bones

28:02.715 --> 28:04.281
and likely cause
speech difficulties,

28:04.316 --> 28:05.515
headaches and nausea.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.351
Okay, can we match these levels

28:07.386 --> 28:09.052
to any specific Superfund sites?

28:09.088 --> 28:10.854
What I can do
is combine the data

28:10.890 --> 28:14.825
that I've got with other
isotope levels that I found.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.761
- Okay, there. In West Virginia.
- That's a mostly

28:17.796 --> 28:19.496
agricultural area.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.331
Angela, start checking
property deeds.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.634
Look for any owner
with a connection to our victim.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.769
Relatives, friends...
Okay.

28:25.804 --> 28:26.570
I'm on it.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.507
<i>Farm's about 20 miles ahead.</i>

28:30.542 --> 28:33.043
Aubrey and a few SWAT guys
are gonna meet me there.

28:33.078 --> 28:35.746
All right? I just want
you to stay in the car.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.748
No. Where you go, I go.

28:37.783 --> 28:40.751
All right, fine.
Just be careful, all right?

28:41.854 --> 28:44.388
Listen, Bones,
I just want to...

28:44.423 --> 28:46.723
say again how sorry I am...
No.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.258
No apologies.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.626
But what you said

28:49.662 --> 28:52.329
to Jeannine about
me doing my duty,

28:52.364 --> 28:54.564
it was, uh,
still my choice.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.601
It always is-- every
time I take a shot, I...

28:57.636 --> 28:59.469
I take responsibility for that.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.438
I know.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.907
And that's why
I stand beside you.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.909
Always.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.239
Okay, here's what we're
gonna do, okay?

29:24.263 --> 29:25.307
Two teams.
I'm gonna lead one.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.541
Aubrey, you're gonna
lead the other one.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.831
I'm gonna go left,

29:27.866 --> 29:29.277
you're gonna go right,
you understand me?

29:29.301 --> 29:30.400
We're gonna
flank the barn,

29:30.436 --> 29:32.169
get into position
before we hit the house.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.682
We're not gonna hit it
till we got support

29:33.706 --> 29:35.405
from the chopper
overhead, you got it?

29:35.441 --> 29:38.608
All right. Also, uh, everybody
look out for tripwires.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.277
This guy knows
explosives.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.778
Just be careful.
I love you.

29:41.814 --> 29:42.814
I love you, too.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.048
Kovac.
It's not him.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.416
It's not Kovac.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.696
- It's Kovac. No...
- Booth...

31:06.732 --> 31:08.665
My hand. I can't move my hand.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.833
Okay, we got to go!

31:09.868 --> 31:10.868
We gotta go!

31:19.478 --> 31:21.778
My gun! I can't get my gun!
I can't move my hand.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.292
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.726
Easy. Easy, damn.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.997
Booth!

31:41.033 --> 31:43.333
Oh, my hand.
My hand, I can't move my hand.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.602
Oh, God. I...
I can't...

31:46.805 --> 31:48.457
Booth, I know
what's wrong with you.

31:48.458 --> 31:48.964
What?

31:48.965 --> 31:52.443
You have isolated volar distal
ulna dislocation, which means

31:52.478 --> 31:53.822
all I need to do is...

31:53.846 --> 31:56.546
Aah! Bones!

31:58.584 --> 32:00.517
You did it.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.586
You did it.

32:46.310 --> 32:48.877
Okay, I have

32:48.913 --> 32:50.979
a red eye for you...
Mm.

32:51.015 --> 32:53.682
...a decaf almond milk
cappuccino for you...

32:53.718 --> 32:55.150
Oh, thank you.
...and, ah!

32:55.186 --> 32:56.752
Dr. Brennan, perfect.

32:56.787 --> 32:58.153
Here. Green tea.

32:58.189 --> 33:01.690
Oh. Th--
Uh, what are these for?

33:01.726 --> 33:03.726
I, uh, just got word
that the major repair work

33:03.761 --> 33:06.173
is starting tomorrow morning,
which means this is the last day

33:06.197 --> 33:08.201
we can be in the lab,
until the work is done.

33:08.202 --> 33:09.280
What about our stuff?

33:09.304 --> 33:11.572
Well, I'm gonna need you
to pack up and label anything

33:11.573 --> 33:13.039
you don't want thrown out,

33:13.075 --> 33:14.774
leave those boxes
in your office,

33:14.810 --> 33:17.744
and take with you anything
you don't want put in storage.

33:17.779 --> 33:19.958
Okay, now I know why you're
plying us with, uh, caffeine.

33:19.982 --> 33:21.514
Hey, how did it go
at the doctor's?

33:21.550 --> 33:26.152
My agnosia's almost gone, so...

33:28.023 --> 33:30.624
I'm going to be okay.

33:31.860 --> 33:33.159
Good.

33:36.565 --> 33:37.742
They won't
change it much,

33:37.766 --> 33:40.667
will they?

33:40.702 --> 33:43.770
Well, they'll try not to, but...

33:43.805 --> 33:45.238
you know how it is.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.706
Everything changes.

33:47.976 --> 33:50.510
Okay.

33:50.545 --> 33:51.578
Grab some boxes.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.780
Get to it.
Yep.

34:02.858 --> 34:04.290
Seeley Booth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:04.326 --> 34:05.603
Get your broad
shoulders over here.

34:05.627 --> 34:06.860
Hey, look at you.

34:06.895 --> 34:09.029
Good morning to
you, too, Caroline.

34:09.063 --> 34:10.929
Don't you be glib.
You almost went

34:10.966 --> 34:13.166
and got yourself killed, again.

34:13.201 --> 34:15.435
When are you ever
gonna stop doing that?

34:15.469 --> 34:16.703
Probably never.

34:16.737 --> 34:18.038
You and your damn sense of duty.

34:18.072 --> 34:21.007
Do you have any idea
how stressful it is

34:21.043 --> 34:22.876
for me to have
such a brave friend?

34:22.911 --> 34:26.012
Well, you know the saying.
Once a Ranger, always a Ranger.

34:26.047 --> 34:27.647
That's not the Ranger slogan,
Aubrey.

34:27.683 --> 34:29.549
Oh. I'm thinking
of Power Rangers.

34:29.583 --> 34:30.884
Well, I'm off

34:30.918 --> 34:33.887
to the courthouse,
gonna make sure Jeannine Kovac

34:33.922 --> 34:36.226
never sees another free day
in her life.

34:36.226 --> 34:37.467
Let me know
if you need anything.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.025
Will do.

34:39.061 --> 34:40.592
Why are you holding a plant?

34:40.629 --> 34:42.896
Oh. Uh, it's for
the new office.

34:42.931 --> 34:44.364
You like it?
Are you gonna take

34:44.399 --> 34:46.199
that plant across the country?

34:46.234 --> 34:50.103
Uh, no, actually.
SSA Halko's retiring.

34:50.138 --> 34:52.690
Deputy Director
offered me his spot.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.408
Meaning same promotion,
but here in D.C.?

34:56.431 --> 34:56.944
Yeah, no.

34:56.945 --> 34:59.057
I thought I wanted to move, but
after everything that's happened

34:59.081 --> 35:02.248
in the last couple of days, I
realized this is where I belong.

35:02.284 --> 35:03.883
Well, I for one

35:03.919 --> 35:06.386
will be happy to see you
around, and I'm guessing

35:06.421 --> 35:08.588
there's a certain quirky,

35:08.623 --> 35:10.056
red-headed anthropologist

35:10.092 --> 35:12.092
who might also be
happy to hear this?

35:12.127 --> 35:15.495
Yeah. She, uh...
she broke up with me.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.398
Oh, <i>Cher.</i> Sorry.

35:20.469 --> 35:21.601
You okay?

35:21.636 --> 35:24.304
No. But I will be.

35:25.407 --> 35:26.706
Aubrey.
Booth.

35:26.742 --> 35:29.275
Yeah. Get that plant
off my desk.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.247
Hi.

35:34.282 --> 35:35.815
Hey.
I just delivered

35:35.851 --> 35:37.417
two buckets of fried chicken

35:37.452 --> 35:38.852
to your office.
Really?

35:38.887 --> 35:40.520
Wow. To celebrate?

35:40.555 --> 35:42.355
Or commiserate.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.857
I heard about your breakup.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.459
And in my
professional opinion,

35:46.495 --> 35:49.462
emotional eating always helps.

35:49.498 --> 35:52.332
Thanks.

35:52.367 --> 35:55.602
Yeah.

35:55.637 --> 35:57.203

Oh, my God.
Hodgins. I found it.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.704
You did?

38:11.740 --> 38:14.407
Angie, that's amazing.
What is that?

38:14.442 --> 38:16.454
It's the project that Angie
and I have been working on.

38:16.478 --> 38:17.822
Come here. You got to
see this. Come here.

38:17.846 --> 38:19.979
You got to show them.
What is it?

38:20.015 --> 38:21.814
We thought it was destroyed.

38:21.850 --> 38:23.616

It's a children's book,
so I'm doing the text,

38:30.225 --> 38:31.836
and then Angie, she's been doing
all the illustrations.

38:31.860 --> 38:33.760
Wait.

38:33.795 --> 38:35.628
We're in it.

38:35.664 --> 38:37.430
Brennan the beetle,

38:37.465 --> 38:38.865
Cam the caterpillar.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.333
Yeah, we're all in it.

38:40.368 --> 38:42.802
It's-it's about us.

38:48.476 --> 38:51.210
Cam has something
to tell you both.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.880
Yeah. Um...

38:53.915 --> 38:56.783
I haven't been completely honest
with you guys,

38:56.818 --> 38:59.419
because it wasn't official,
but, um...

38:59.454 --> 39:02.255
Arastoo and I aren't actually
going to Europe.

39:02.290 --> 39:04.157
We're going to Mississippi

39:04.192 --> 39:05.825

39:05.860 --> 39:08.094

39:10.999 --> 39:13.466
Oh, my God, look. Who are
these beautiful children?

39:13.501 --> 39:15.068
That is Tyler.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.403
This is Isaiah,

39:17.439 --> 39:19.305
and the youngest one here
is Jordan.

39:19.341 --> 39:20.606
They're siblings.

39:20.642 --> 39:22.342
They're in foster care.

39:22.377 --> 39:26.379
Cam and Arastoo have petitioned
to adopt them.

39:26.414 --> 39:28.359
And this is why you asked
for a leave of absence. Cam...

39:28.383 --> 39:29.882
Yeah. Arastoo

39:29.918 --> 39:33.353
and I both wanted to be around
for a while, full time,

39:33.388 --> 39:38.791
to help them settle in,
and to help us become a family.

39:38.827 --> 39:41.728
Oh, Cam,
that is such wonderful news.

39:41.763 --> 39:43.029
It really is.

39:43.064 --> 39:44.630
We're very happy for you, Cam.

39:44.666 --> 39:46.566
Now, for the position

39:46.601 --> 39:49.435
of the interim director
of the lab while Cam is away...

39:49.471 --> 39:50.703
Yes.

39:50.739 --> 39:53.339
Congratulations, Dr. B.
No.

39:53.375 --> 39:55.908
