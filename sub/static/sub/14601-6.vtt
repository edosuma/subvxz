he was already
diagnosed with tertiary syphilis.

15:09.454 --> 15:11.454
By the time he got out of jail in 1939,

15:11.456 --> 15:14.040
he was really starting to slip mentally.

15:20.882 --> 15:22.599

of experimental treatments,

Capone moves to his estate in Miami

15:36.648 --> 15:40.566
to live under the care
of his wife and family.

15:40.568 --> 15:43.820
(Laurence Bergreen) At that time,
there was no known cure for syphilis.

15:43.822 --> 15:46.906
Finally, sulfa drugs
came along and penicillin,

15:46.908 --> 15:48.658
but that wasn't until the 1940s.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.544

15:51.546 --> 15:54.631
He was unable to rescue himself.

15:54.633 --> 15:57.050
He was just in a fog of dementia.

(narrator) For Capone's top lieutenants,

16:02.841 --> 16:06.759

them everything is devastating.

16:13.435 --> 16:17.270

18:15.224 --> 18:17.474

If you're gonna kill
me, get it over with.

33:14.599 --> 33:17.100
How much does your policy
wheel bring in a year?

33:17.102 --> 33:20.853
Two million. Give or take.

33:22.741 --> 33:24.657
I'll make this simple.

33:24.659 --> 33:28.745
You leave town, hand over your wheel,

33:28.747 --> 33:31.280
and I'll cut you in for 200 grand.

33:31.282 --> 33:33.449
Do I have a choice?

33:33.451 --> 33:35.284
This is the best deal you're gonna get.

33:35.286 --> 33:40.373
If you wanna live, you should take it.

33:44.963 --> 33:48.097
Fine.

33:48.099 --> 33:50.016
It's a deal.

33:51.970 --> 33:54.303
("Accardo") Untie him.

33:54.305 --> 33:56.139
Let him go.

34:01.479 --> 34:05.782
(Robert Grant) Tony Accardo did not
like attention being drawn to him

34:05.784 --> 34:08.484
and would take
measures to mitigate that risk.

34:12.322 --> 34:15.158
Sam Giancana would take those risks

34:15.159 --> 34:17.210
knowing that it put him at risk

34:17.212 --> 34:18.828
but thought he could manage it.

34:25.754 --> 34:28.337
("Accardo") What you did was stupid.

34:28.339 --> 34:30.806
All right.

34:32.342 --> 34:33.842
I'm sorry.

34:33.844 --> 34:35.844
It won't happen again.

34:35.847 --> 34:40.016
Jones' policy wheel. Can you run it?

34:40.018 --> 34:41.684
Yeah.

34:41.686 --> 34:45.438
I know it better than anyone else.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.023
I got it for us, didn't I?

34:48.193 --> 34:51.444
Well, that's debatable.

34:51.446 --> 34:53.696
Sure.

34:53.697 --> 34:56.364
If I give this to you,

34:56.367 --> 34:59.035
I need to be able to trust you.

34:59.037 --> 35:04.791
That means not making any
moves until you talk to me first.

35:06.928 --> 35:09.796
You first. Got it.

35:12.717 --> 35:15.935
I'm giving you something big here.

35:15.937 --> 35:18.805
Don't screw it up.

35:27.982 --> 35:32.151
(narrator) With Accardo's blessing,

35:32.153 --> 35:36.372
Sam Giancana takes over
Jones' policy wheel,

35:36.374 --> 35:40.626
and soon targets all the
other wheels in the city.

35:42.380 --> 35:46.048
Giancana and Accardo
proceeded to take it over.

35:46.050 --> 35:48.668
They cut heads off.

35:52.390 --> 35:54.243
They blew people up.

35:56.678 --> 35:58.344
These are businesspeople.

35:58.346 --> 36:01.430
But they're still men
ruthless enough and willing

36:01.432 --> 36:03.766
to murder for money.

36:03.768 --> 36:07.937
They left African
Americans nominally in charge,

36:07.939 --> 36:09.355
but they got the money.

36:11.776 --> 36:17.663
(narrator) All told, the Outfit's
takeover of the Chicago policy racket

36:17.665 --> 36:21.501
will earn them upwards of $150 million.

36:34.048 --> 36:38.551
But just as things are
improving for the Chicago Outfit,

36:38.553 --> 36:41.187
Accardo receives devastating news.

36:43.308 --> 36:44.891
Al Capone,

36:44.893 --> 36:50.313
his mentor and the most notorious
gangster in America,

36:50.315 --> 36:52.315
is dead.

37:14.768 --> 37:19.103
(narrator) On January 25, 1947,

37:19.222 --> 37:21.889
former boss of the Chicago mafia,

37:22.058 --> 37:25.309
Al Capone, dies at the age of 48.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.067
Mae...

37:33.153 --> 37:34.735
I'm so sorry for your loss.

37:34.871 --> 37:39.240
We'll make sure we look after you guys.

37:39.375 --> 37:41.876
If you ever need anything...

37:50.970 --> 37:52.470
(narrator) Tony Accardo,

37:52.589 --> 37:54.589
Capone's bodyguard and enforcer,

37:54.757 --> 37:56.891
and now the head of the Outfit,

37:57.010 --> 38:00.761
is rumored to have sent
Capone's wife, Mae, money to live off of

38:00.847 --> 38:04.432
until her death in 1986,

38:04.517 --> 38:08.486
a show of respect to
America's most infamous gangster.

38:22.484 --> 38:24.752
(Eig) I think we're fascinated
with Capone because he did

38:24.871 --> 38:27.788
what a lot of us dream of doing,

38:27.924 --> 38:29.957
getting rich and powerful.

38:34.547 --> 38:36.297
He seemed like just
an everyman, you know.

38:36.466 --> 38:38.125
He didn't inherit this power.

38:41.471 --> 38:43.020
He worked his way up

38:43.139 --> 38:46.337
and built this twisted
version of the American dream.

38:49.445 --> 38:51.062
(narrator) After his death,

38:51.064 --> 38:55.366
Capone becomes an even bigger legend,

38:55.368 --> 38:59.487
inspiring countless books...

38:59.489 --> 39:02.088
movies and TV shows.

39:03.543 --> 39:06.911
(Eisenbach) Al Capone contributes
to the romance of the mobster

39:06.913 --> 39:10.498
as this iconic American man

39:10.500 --> 39:11.966
who is independent,

39:11.968 --> 39:13.634
he's not anybody's puppet,

39:13.636 --> 39:16.554
and he's making his
own way in the world.

39:18.424 --> 39:20.174
(narrator) For nearly a decade,

39:20.176 --> 39:22.143
the son of Italian immigrants

39:22.145 --> 39:27.682
virtually ran
America's second largest city,

39:27.684 --> 39:31.652
building a massive illegal operation

39:31.654 --> 39:34.939
valued at over $1
billion in today's money.

39:36.693 --> 39:38.659
(Calabrese) No matter
where you go in the world,

39:38.661 --> 39:40.278
when you tell
somebody you're from Chicago,

39:40.280 --> 39:42.663
there's two names that
are always mentioned,

39:42.665 --> 39:45.499
Michael Jordan and Al Capone.

39:45.501 --> 39:49.921
He was and always will be a
big part of the Chicago mafia.

39:58.298 --> 40:00.381
(narrator) The empire that Capone built

40:00.383 --> 40:02.883
is now run by Tony Accardo.

40:02.885 --> 40:05.519
And months after Capone's death,

40:05.521 --> 40:09.307
another top figure in
the Outfit re-emerges,

40:09.309 --> 40:11.976
Paul Ricca,

40:11.978 --> 40:14.612
who gets released from prison early

40:14.614 --> 40:17.565
and takes his place alongside Accardo

40:17.567 --> 40:19.734
as co-head of the Outfit,

40:19.736 --> 40:22.703
which is making more
money than ever before

40:22.705 --> 40:25.323
thanks to the policy racket.

40:25.325 --> 40:28.576
(Binder) Ricca was very, very
valuable to the organization,

40:28.578 --> 40:30.411
but just because you've returned,

40:30.413 --> 40:34.665
usually you don't displace the
guy who was already there.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.667
Accardo stays in as operating boss

40:36.669 --> 40:38.803
and handles things on
a day-to-day basis,

40:38.805 --> 40:42.840
but for strategic
guidance, he goes to Ricca.

40:49.265 --> 40:51.232
Business is good.

40:51.234 --> 40:52.984
Odds are a thousand to one.

40:52.986 --> 40:56.604
Payout's 600 to one at best.

40:56.606 --> 40:59.490
Means we're keeping eight out
of every $10 that comes in.

41:01.194 --> 41:02.610
How much is it generating?

41:02.612 --> 41:05.613
About half a million a month.

41:07.784 --> 41:09.200
That's a lot of cash.

41:10.620 --> 41:12.003
I know.

41:14.624 --> 41:17.375
It's becoming a problem.

41:17.377 --> 41:20.177
It's a lot to handle without
drawing too much attention.

41:21.964 --> 41:26.434
I was thinking we'd hide
it as legitimate cash.

41:26.436 --> 41:27.802
Yeah.

41:29.472 --> 41:31.439
But where?

41:36.312 --> 41:37.835
Vegas.

41:43.653 --> 41:45.903
♪ ♪

41:48.324 --> 41:50.124
Las Vegas is a boom town.

41:50.126 --> 41:52.626
The rules haven't been written.

41:52.628 --> 41:55.996
It's the perfect spot to take
what they've earned illegally,

41:55.998 --> 41:58.049
in various illegal
operations around the country,

41:58.051 --> 42:01.669
including other gambling, and
run it through the casinos.

42:06.509 --> 42:11.345
(narrator) But there's just one problem.

42:11.347 --> 42:14.982
The New York mob is already there.
