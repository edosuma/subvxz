WEBVTT

00:02.830 --> 00:04.923
We're tired of waiting. You're finished.

00:04.952 --> 00:07.119
She's coming for both of us.

00:07.150 --> 00:10.358
I want ICE! This what you're after?

00:10.405 --> 00:12.374
- What do you want?
- Kaz Proctor.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.010
Oh, fuck!

00:18.045 --> 00:19.483
Open the fucking door

00:19.494 --> 00:21.828
or I'm gonna cut this baby out!

00:22.330 --> 00:24.610
I'm gonna step back from
my governor's duties.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.528
I need you to take
over as acting governor.

00:26.563 --> 00:29.560
Liz, this is Dr Miller,
the new staff psychiatrist.

00:29.589 --> 00:31.119
I don't know how much time I've got left

00:31.130 --> 00:33.083
but I've still got
things that I want to do.

00:33.111 --> 00:35.845
- Why don't you write them down?
- Like, a... bucket list?

00:36.102 --> 00:38.533
Can you commit to me? Now?

00:39.140 --> 00:42.445
We can't keep hiding this
for the next 15 years.

00:42.499 --> 00:44.779
- What? You want to call it off?
- But I know you love me,

00:44.790 --> 00:47.423
and you can't fake that.
You're the girl I'm gonna marry.

00:47.450 --> 00:49.727
We're gonna have a fucking wedding!

00:57.540 --> 00:59.948
Ray!

02:32.814 --> 02:35.089
Hey! Breakfast?

02:38.381 --> 02:40.079
Come on, sis!

02:45.975 --> 02:50.560
So... as I am reducing my hours,

02:51.170 --> 02:53.246
I have decided to step back

02:53.263 --> 02:55.433
from the day to day
governance of the prison

02:55.434 --> 02:57.016
until I return from maternity leave.

02:57.141 --> 03:01.075
No doubt, you will all give
Mr Jackson your full support

03:01.110 --> 03:03.743
in his temporary role
as acting governor.

03:06.930 --> 03:08.414
Thank you, Governor.

03:08.703 --> 03:10.071
Uh, Vera.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.183
Erm...

03:15.112 --> 03:17.805
OK. Um...

03:17.930 --> 03:20.206
I've got two main priorities.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.393
I think we're under servicing
our vocational training

03:23.445 --> 03:26.540
so I'll be looking to broaden
the select of TAFE programmes.

03:26.552 --> 03:29.284
- That'll cost money.
- Well, we'll target some more hotels

03:29.313 --> 03:31.158
for their laundry
business to pay for it.

03:31.551 --> 03:33.125
- Yeah, OK, great.
- OK.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.965
I also want to shut
down the drug supply.

03:35.211 --> 03:37.507
- Easier said than done!
- I say we order a ramp.

03:37.530 --> 03:40.444
I don't think spending
thousands on a ramp

03:40.491 --> 03:43.802
is the smartest thing for Mr Jackson
to do on his first days in charge.

03:44.010 --> 03:46.846
For a start, we'll increase
the perimeter security

03:46.869 --> 03:49.979
and rotate the guards
around all the entry points.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.325
Now, in regards to the
shooting at the gatehouse,

03:52.348 --> 03:54.288
the police are reviewing
the security tape

03:54.316 --> 03:57.121
so, if requested, please make
yourself available to them.

03:57.162 --> 03:58.450
Who's acting deputy?

03:58.636 --> 04:00.120
I'll be interviewing for the position

04:00.130 --> 04:02.406
so I encourage all the
senior officers to apply.

04:02.415 --> 04:03.487
I'm up for it.

04:03.921 --> 04:04.928
Good.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.734
Thank you, everyone.

04:13.062 --> 04:14.817
I'll get you a cuppa, right?

04:25.812 --> 04:27.498
I'm sorry for your loss.

04:38.290 --> 04:39.596
Who do you reckon did it?

04:40.007 --> 04:41.301
Killed her bloke?

04:41.426 --> 04:43.205
Your guess is as good as mine.

04:43.518 --> 04:47.311
- ... Drive through Paris in a sports car.
- Yes, with the top down.

04:47.348 --> 04:51.250
- OK. So flashing your titties?
- No, no, no, the car's top, not mine!

04:53.157 --> 04:54.404
How are you gonna do that?

04:54.433 --> 04:57.788
- Well, you said whatever I wanted!
- Yeah, yeah.

04:58.111 --> 05:00.520
I could push you around the
prison on a laundry trolley?

05:00.537 --> 05:04.385
- Oh, wow! The worst bucket list ever!
- No, shut up! It's a good bucket list!

05:04.410 --> 05:06.348
Shh, hey, hey!

05:08.170 --> 05:10.354
How are you going, love?

05:12.232 --> 05:15.720
- And to tango?
- Yes, that's the tango.

05:15.770 --> 05:18.399
That's a dance, love, and
I've always wanted to learn it

05:18.411 --> 05:20.322
because apparently it's very sensual.

05:20.610 --> 05:21.956
I could teach you to bum dance!

05:21.970 --> 05:24.307
Booms, I don't want to
know how to bum dance, love.

05:24.318 --> 05:25.727
- Yes, you...
- Sorry.

05:25.779 --> 05:29.417
Like this! No, you just do it like this!

05:29.450 --> 05:32.229
- Boomer!
- Yeah! Work it!

05:32.246 --> 05:34.942
- Boomer!
- Jenkins!

05:35.318 --> 05:37.258
Arse out of Birdsworth's face!

05:37.850 --> 05:40.122
Proctor, finish up.
Governor wants to see you.

05:41.225 --> 05:43.252
Ah, God, Boomer!

05:43.290 --> 05:45.342
- And AGAIN!
- No!

05:50.930 --> 05:53.379
- Did you bring Proctor?
- Yeah. Um...

05:53.504 --> 05:55.393
I just wanted a quick word.

05:56.150 --> 05:57.969
How's Linda?

05:57.991 --> 06:00.921
Applying for deputy? It's hilarious!

06:00.943 --> 06:03.233
I know you've got to be
seen to follow protocol

06:03.234 --> 06:04.989
but I'll your be your 2IC, right?

06:05.210 --> 06:07.074
Could you show Proctor in, please?

06:08.685 --> 06:10.002
Yeah!

06:11.399 --> 06:12.716
Proctor.

06:19.772 --> 06:21.970
- Take a seat.
- Where's the governor?

06:22.010 --> 06:25.599
Miss Bennet's on reduced
duties until maternity leave.

06:25.622 --> 06:28.348
I'm acting governor.

06:28.410 --> 06:30.381
Right. Congratulations.

06:30.506 --> 06:32.668
You wanted to see me because... ?

06:33.067 --> 06:34.556
Uh...

06:34.681 --> 06:36.845
I want to know how the
ice is coming in, Kaz.

06:36.878 --> 06:38.322
Now you need me!

06:38.362 --> 06:40.313
You've hardly spoken
to me in three months.

06:40.438 --> 06:42.675
I'm sorry for breaking
off our arrangement.

06:43.754 --> 06:46.110
- But I did that because...
- ... You made a new arrangement

06:46.121 --> 06:47.519
with another prisoner.

06:48.370 --> 06:51.000
I did that because I
wanted to protect you, Kaz.

06:52.462 --> 06:54.188
But I made a mistake.

06:55.176 --> 06:56.654
I got it wrong.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.651
And I'm sorry.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.207
Look, you know how important it is

07:04.213 --> 07:06.787
for the governor and the top
dog to support each other.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.610
You want to work together again?

07:11.650 --> 07:13.526
We make a great team, Kaz.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.575
Are you fucking listening to me?

07:23.592 --> 07:25.110
- Don't fucking smile!
- You heard her!

07:25.134 --> 07:27.156
What do you think this
is? A fucking charity?

07:27.161 --> 07:29.720
- You don't get shit for...
- I'll take you down, you bitch!

07:29.909 --> 07:31.885
Piss off!

07:31.949 --> 07:34.044
You too. You heard
me! Disa-fucking-ppear!

07:37.584 --> 07:39.177
Are you bringing ice in?

07:39.206 --> 07:40.865
- No!
- You gave Kylee Webb the crank.

07:40.876 --> 07:43.012
- She went psycho on it! I didn't! Don't bullshit me!
- I didn't!

07:43.036 --> 07:44.869
I don't deal in meth, Kaz, I swear!

07:44.878 --> 07:46.570
Sketchpads make for shit clients.

07:46.644 --> 07:48.775
If you're lying to me,
Vicky, I'm gonna make you fly,

07:48.799 --> 07:51.380
just like I made Sonia
fly. You got that?

07:54.810 --> 07:56.369
Hey, girls.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.816
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:32.730 --> 08:34.515
Hey.

08:35.409 --> 08:37.792
You were gonna train me today, remember?

08:38.839 --> 08:42.109
It was Marie. She killed Ray.

08:42.570 --> 08:44.534
How would she get to him?

08:44.563 --> 08:48.035
Word is Marie's lost
everything. She's got no pull.

08:51.124 --> 08:53.044
Hey, sissie!

08:54.730 --> 08:57.245
It freaks me out seeing you like this.

09:00.905 --> 09:02.897
He's stuck.

09:03.662 --> 09:04.997
Ray.

09:05.784 --> 09:08.725
I've been seeing that Old
Man Crow, the trickster!

09:09.025 --> 09:10.570
He's been playing with me,

09:10.695 --> 09:13.290
holding back Ray's spirit
from where it needs to go.

09:13.415 --> 09:16.109
The crow! Why would he do that?

09:18.950 --> 09:22.022
Ray's not gonna rest until
I've done payback for him.

09:23.027 --> 09:24.886
What if it wasn't Marie?

09:26.284 --> 09:27.860
It's her all right.

09:28.265 --> 09:30.044
I had certain assurances Rodney...

09:30.061 --> 09:33.085
- I know, Marie.
- ... and he didn't lift a bloody finger during the trial!

09:33.122 --> 09:36.320
Someone in his position can't be
seen to manipulate the judiciary.

09:36.349 --> 09:37.930
So what can he do?

09:37.970 --> 09:40.079
He can influence legislature.

09:41.344 --> 09:43.890
OK, I'm listening.

09:43.930 --> 09:46.005
You were convicted on
a proximate cause

09:46.050 --> 09:48.032
and that's a woolly legal area.

09:48.072 --> 09:51.034
Our best chance is to have that
law changed retrospectively.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.690
And how long is that gonna take?

09:52.882 --> 09:55.094
A lot less than 15 years.

09:55.659 --> 09:58.939
I can make some discreet calls
but you have to sit tight.

09:58.997 --> 10:00.949
I am sitting on a fucking powder keg

10:00.972 --> 10:03.132
with his name on it
so you tell him that!

10:11.003 --> 10:12.446
Hey.

10:12.914 --> 10:16.645
- We're neighbours.
- Yes, we are.

10:16.770 --> 10:19.370
- How's Will settling in?
- Oh, he's...

10:19.959 --> 10:22.401
... practically redecorated the office.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.108
I made that list for you.

10:27.130 --> 10:29.856
Candidates for your
anti-recidivist program.

10:29.885 --> 10:31.496
Fantastic. Thank you.

10:31.716 --> 10:34.048
- Susan Jenkins.
- Yes, she is...

10:34.072 --> 10:35.907
fairly easily influenced by her peers

10:35.936 --> 10:39.210
so runs the risk of reoffending
and her parole is almost due.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.636
Ah, sounds perfect.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.506
I've deliberately left
some names off the list.

10:42.530 --> 10:44.742
Those I deemed too institutionalized

10:44.753 --> 10:46.965
or too entrenched in their
anti-social behaviour.

10:46.970 --> 10:49.397
- Well everyone's redeemable, Vera.
- I don't know about that.

10:49.414 --> 10:52.445
I have met some pretty
irredeemable characters in my time.

10:52.570 --> 10:56.415
How's the new office? Oh, sorry.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

10:56.416 --> 10:58.912
- No.
- Vera's just been helping me set up my program.

10:58.941 --> 11:00.240
Terrific.

11:00.950 --> 11:04.691
Well, I'm also a
resource you can exploit.

11:04.816 --> 11:06.944
Oh, thanks, man. I'll remember that.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.410
But, at the moment, I think
Vera's given me everything I need.

11:09.610 --> 11:10.859
Great.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.444
Great.

11:17.505 --> 11:19.122
So the problem is

11:19.145 --> 11:21.610
there's just not enough
rehabilitation studies

11:21.616 --> 11:24.890
to provide an effective
analysis for recidivism programs.

11:25.063 --> 11:28.712
Now apart from the new drug trial,
my system has six components.

11:28.724 --> 11:30.364
The risk-needs assessment,

11:30.387 --> 11:32.397
an analysis of your
individual motivators,

11:32.714 --> 11:35.180
targeting the appropriate intervention,

11:35.572 --> 11:38.910
rewiring the brain
through the practice of...

11:39.482 --> 11:41.665
... Plus ongoing support.

11:42.652 --> 11:44.292
So, what do you think?

11:46.410 --> 11:48.085
Do I have to get my kit off?

11:48.293 --> 11:50.903
'Cos I wouldn't have
a problem with that!

11:51.355 --> 11:53.370
No, there's no physical exam.

11:53.495 --> 11:56.852
- I'm more interested in what's going on up here.
- No!

11:56.894 --> 12:00.035
No way. You're not
fucking with me brain.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.321
- I'd like to start with a test.
- Ay? No!

12:03.350 --> 12:05.353
Miss Bennett didn't say
say nothing about no test.

12:05.388 --> 12:07.317
It's just a standard personality test.

12:07.329 --> 12:09.205
There's no right or wrong answers.

12:09.499 --> 12:13.351
It's gonna help me tailor
a program just for you.

12:27.995 --> 12:29.770
I managed to get a look at the footage.

12:30.051 --> 12:33.476
Not pretty. Took two in the
chest with a sawn-off shottie.

12:37.010 --> 12:38.890
Did you get a look at the shooter?

12:39.123 --> 12:41.416
Two guys on a motorbike.
Both had helmets.

12:41.450 --> 12:43.321
Guy on the back was the trigger man.

12:43.770 --> 12:45.700
As if they wanted to make a point,

12:45.970 --> 12:48.224
driver was wearing a bikers' jacket.

12:49.391 --> 12:51.140
Butchers' Motorcycle Club.

13:03.729 --> 13:05.213
I don't know how to tango, Liz,

13:05.224 --> 13:07.223
but I know how to dance round my bag!

13:08.891 --> 13:10.762
You should come over here
and throw a few punches.

13:10.770 --> 13:13.320
No, love. I'd fall over my own feet.

13:14.239 --> 13:16.826
- Well, if Boomer, here, can do it, anyone can.
- Yeah!

13:16.895 --> 13:18.252
Oi!

13:20.239 --> 13:23.425
- You're as slow as an old turtle!
- I'm not!

13:23.456 --> 13:24.690
- You are.
- I'm not!

13:24.704 --> 13:25.910
Reets!

13:29.767 --> 13:32.469
- You killed Ray!
- Hey, hey. Rita!

13:32.481 --> 13:34.895
- It's OK, babe. What are you talking about?
- I know it was you.

13:34.918 --> 13:37.216
The Butchers, they were behind
it! They do your dirty work!

13:37.233 --> 13:39.448
- Not any more.
- You've still got links to the bastards...

13:39.472 --> 13:41.164
Rita, haven't you heard?
It's all gone to shit for me.

13:41.182 --> 13:43.157
- I've got nothing on the outside.
- Don't fucking lie to my face!

13:43.174 --> 13:44.704
- Rita, she's not like that!
- Just think about it!

13:44.722 --> 13:47.170
Why would the Butchers kill
Ray? I think you know why.

13:47.181 --> 13:49.792
You know that little bogus drug
deal? You put Ray in the shit!

13:49.804 --> 13:53.935
- That's fucking bullshit!
- The Butchers hit Ray because of what you did!

14:02.510 --> 14:04.365
Step back, lady.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.465
Just step back.

14:07.042 --> 14:08.850
Get away from her.

14:10.026 --> 14:13.440
- You want to get slotted?
- You did this, Rita!

14:13.693 --> 14:16.125
Fuck you!

14:17.490 --> 14:20.456
His death's on you!

14:27.335 --> 14:29.010
Connors?

14:30.857 --> 14:32.243
Connors?

14:33.770 --> 14:35.874
Ray's dead because of me.

14:37.433 --> 14:39.677
So, why did you attack Winter?

14:40.250 --> 14:43.399
Mistake. I thought...

14:46.304 --> 14:48.602
Look, I understand what
you're going through.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.050
I know it's tough,

14:53.522 --> 14:55.485
but you beat a prisoner to death

14:55.610 --> 14:57.841
and now you're
threatening another inmate.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.226
You give me one good reason

15:00.249 --> 15:03.223
- why I shouldn't put you in isolation, permanently.
- No.

15:03.442 --> 15:04.932
You can't.

15:05.530 --> 15:09.476
You can't separate me from
my sister, Mr Jackson, please.

15:10.192 --> 15:11.815
Ruby's all I got.

15:18.087 --> 15:19.571
Miss Miles.

15:21.055 --> 15:22.401
The slot?

15:27.349 --> 15:30.683
Reckon you're lucky Mr Jackson
knows a thing or two about grief.

15:31.370 --> 15:32.947
Wait there.

15:33.322 --> 15:34.639
Hey...

15:46.875 --> 15:48.342
Let's go, Connors.

15:49.210 --> 15:52.009
Connors! I said, "Let's go."

15:55.842 --> 15:58.463
Oi! Any of youse know how to tango?

15:58.475 --> 16:01.057
What?! What are you talking about... ?

16:01.182 --> 16:04.141
Hey! What about youse lot?
Any of you know how to tango?

16:04.158 --> 16:07.112
- Nah, mate.
- No? Fuckin' hell.

16:07.176 --> 16:10.484
Does anyone know how to fuckin' tango?!

16:12.511 --> 16:15.029
Hey, Lizzie? How's about the Nutbush?

16:15.070 --> 16:16.911
- No.
- Pole dancing?

16:16.946 --> 16:18.966
'Cos plenty of these ladies
know how to do that, eh?

16:18.990 --> 16:22.645
Booms, don't worry about
it, love. No, I will worry!

16:22.836 --> 16:24.476
All right? I will worry!

16:25.930 --> 16:27.247
Oi!

16:27.770 --> 16:30.964
- Do you know how to tango?!
- Liz?

16:31.770 --> 16:35.023
Lizzie, you OK?

16:35.970 --> 16:38.828
That's the second dead
bird I've seen this week!

16:42.783 --> 16:45.376
Hey, Ruby. What's Rita said to you?

16:45.690 --> 16:47.481
- About what?
- Well, does she reckon Marie's

16:47.504 --> 16:49.028
got something to do with Ray's death?

16:49.219 --> 16:52.233
I think... she's just
grieving, you know?

16:52.279 --> 16:54.944
- Bloody awful, isn't it?
- Appalling.

17:02.214 --> 17:04.061
Oh, gross!

17:04.627 --> 17:07.164
Feels like all its bones are busted!

17:07.400 --> 17:10.623
It got dropped out of a drone, you
butter head! What do you expect?

17:11.690 --> 17:14.902
You're a sick fucking genius!

17:17.811 --> 17:20.214
You... get down!

17:20.226 --> 17:21.685
The fuck is this?

17:21.810 --> 17:23.361
Looks like meth to me.

17:23.406 --> 17:25.047
- Kaz, look...
- Shut up!

17:26.531 --> 17:28.454
You lied to me.*

17:28.481 --> 17:31.210
- You did give Kylee the gear.
- I didn't!

17:31.335 --> 17:33.973
- You're still lying?
- I deal in ice, OK?

17:34.002 --> 17:37.129
- But I didn't sell any ice to that junkie skank!
- Who did you sell it to?

17:38.370 --> 17:40.143
Who'd you sell it to?

17:42.592 --> 17:45.300
Marie! I sold an envelope to Marie!

18:04.351 --> 18:05.956
Hey, Chocco.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.096
Good to see you.

18:17.655 --> 18:19.530
Still can't believe it happened.

18:20.171 --> 18:22.244
It's like a bomb's gone off at the club.

18:22.273 --> 18:25.422
- Whole place is in shock.
- It was the Butchers.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.292
- What?
- They did the hit.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.238
Are you sure?

18:30.650 --> 18:32.982
- How?
- Security footage.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.972
- Driver was wearing their colours.
- Shit.

18:39.166 --> 18:40.616
Don't shed.*

18:40.674 --> 18:42.410
Blood for blood.

18:42.614 --> 18:44.690
We've gotta hit 'em hard, Chocco.

18:44.935 --> 18:46.997
Too fucking right we do.

18:56.813 --> 18:58.776
Marie tried to kill me.

19:00.393 --> 19:01.739
Kylee's attack.

19:01.864 --> 19:03.759
Just found out Marie was behind that.

19:03.777 --> 19:05.373
Are you sure?

19:07.288 --> 19:09.430
I heard what you said
to her in the yard.

19:09.459 --> 19:12.653
Hey. We team up, we take her out.

19:13.998 --> 19:15.693
What are you saying?

19:18.323 --> 19:20.027
You know what I'm saying.

19:21.373 --> 19:24.052
I gave her a warning and
she fucking ignored it.

19:25.842 --> 19:28.048
- Not interested.
- Hey.

19:28.573 --> 19:30.933
Don't you want to avenge Ray's death?

19:30.973 --> 19:33.638
I am. The club's taking care of it.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.340
Wasn't Marie.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.874
Can youse tango?

19:46.734 --> 19:48.652
What about youse? Can youse tango?

19:48.831 --> 19:50.944
- No.
- Oh, fuck!

19:50.996 --> 19:52.185
How hard can it be?

19:52.226 --> 19:53.681
- Jenkins?
- Yeah?

19:58.259 --> 20:00.505
- It's very creative.
- Yeah. Cocked it up.

20:01.394 --> 20:03.809
I must have sex on my brain, eh?

20:03.855 --> 20:06.528
Can't blame me. How
friggin' hot's Dr Miller?!

20:06.552 --> 20:08.014
Look, the thing is,

20:08.499 --> 20:11.369
I picked you for this
programme especially.

20:11.413 --> 20:13.037
- You did? Oh.
- Yeah!

20:13.093 --> 20:14.705
Don't you want to be part of something?

20:15.410 --> 20:17.621
Something of real importance

20:17.746 --> 20:20.046
that could help other
women in your position?

20:20.311 --> 20:21.587
Nah.

20:21.789 --> 20:23.596
- Susan.
- Wha... ?

20:23.775 --> 20:25.074
Yeah?

20:25.548 --> 20:27.228
Please?

20:36.973 --> 20:38.725
I'll leave that with you.

20:40.821 --> 20:42.925
- How did you... ?
- Aw, I just...

20:43.415 --> 20:45.413
... appealed to Boomer's better nature.

20:45.436 --> 20:48.832
Ah, the Salida! That sounds deadly.

20:48.867 --> 20:51.088
Oh, wow! This is all off the internet!

20:51.102 --> 20:53.304
- How did you get it?
- Vinegar tits.

20:53.356 --> 20:54.991
- Eh?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:55.002 --> 20:58.680
Had to do some deal with her
to do some dumb test, didn't I?

20:58.692 --> 21:01.550
You probably got better things
you could've bargained for, love.

21:01.579 --> 21:04.212
Like extra privileges or less work unit?

21:04.253 --> 21:06.557
- Yeah, more Monte Carlos.
- No!

21:06.632 --> 21:08.883
No, your bucket list's
much more important

21:08.912 --> 21:10.529
than any of that shit, eh?

21:10.773 --> 21:12.088
Really?

21:12.111 --> 21:14.810
- Eh? I'm more important than Monte Carlos!
- Yes.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.448
Don't let it go to your head.

21:16.490 --> 21:18.488
Oh, not that it will stay in there.

21:50.957 --> 21:52.143
Rit?

21:56.538 --> 21:57.993
I did it, Ru.

21:58.453 --> 21:59.853
I killed him.

22:03.329 --> 22:06.419
I set him up to take the
fall for me a while back.

22:07.168 --> 22:09.201
To protect my cover.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.573
The Butchers killed Ray.

22:15.893 --> 22:18.168
It was payback for that.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.458
I killed him.

22:39.015 --> 22:40.822
Boomer, these answers show that you have

22:40.863 --> 22:43.894
great emotional intelligence and empathy

22:44.570 --> 22:48.199
- but that you often act on impulse.
- Well, yeah.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.826
And given that impulse
can lead to poor decisions,

22:51.861 --> 22:54.176
we need to come up with some
strategies to control them.

22:54.233 --> 22:58.051
- Like, er, full-body massage?
- Well, no.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.440
But there are certain
exercises we can do to help

23:00.484 --> 23:02.248
practice impulse restraint.

23:02.306 --> 23:04.051
- Oh.
- Now, for instance,

23:04.062 --> 23:06.089
tell me one of your vices.

23:07.174 --> 23:10.235
- My what?
- Like something that you want

23:10.246 --> 23:12.250
but you know you
probably shouldn't have.

23:12.375 --> 23:13.763
Oh.

23:14.132 --> 23:16.338
- Monte Carlos.
- Ooh!

23:16.463 --> 23:18.597
- It's Tim Tams for me.
- Boo!

23:18.602 --> 23:20.086
Yeah!

23:20.104 --> 23:23.187
- OK, so here's your challenge, Boomer.
- Mm?

23:23.216 --> 23:26.699
I want you to resist
eating a Monte Carlo...

23:27.195 --> 23:28.951
... for 24 hours.

23:31.919 --> 23:33.484
Think you can do that?

23:34.165 --> 23:36.151
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

23:36.625 --> 23:38.161
Yeah.

23:38.490 --> 23:39.917
Have you got any questions?

23:40.042 --> 23:41.840
You're not gay, are you?

23:51.010 --> 23:52.321
Well?

23:54.603 --> 23:57.711
- We had a sit down with the Butchers.
- A sit down?

23:57.836 --> 24:00.148
We were gonna blow the
fuckers up, you know?

24:00.273 --> 24:03.067
- Old Conqueror special.
- So, why didn't you?

24:05.246 --> 24:08.693
- Turns out they didn't do the hit.
- Because they told you that?

24:09.697 --> 24:12.399
Jesus, Chocco, what
about the fucking jacket?

24:12.422 --> 24:13.563
Guy went rogue.

24:13.591 --> 24:16.537
He was driving the bike but
the club swears, black and blue,

24:16.554 --> 24:17.922
they didn't order it.

24:17.950 --> 24:20.959
Listen to me, Rita, I know the
Butchers weren't behind this.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.076
Why would you believe them?

24:25.006 --> 24:27.430
Because we found out
who the shooter was.

24:28.764 --> 24:31.000
This guy called Lucas.

24:32.743 --> 24:35.104
- Lucas?
- Yeah.

24:35.904 --> 24:39.366
Known associate of that
Drago bitch you killed.

24:43.844 --> 24:47.092
We 100% think it's payback for that.

25:01.492 --> 25:02.929
I'm in.

25:04.331 --> 25:05.830
We kill her.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.212
- How?
- You tell me.

25:10.246 --> 25:12.936
- We shiv her.
- Both of us at the same?

25:12.976 --> 25:15.176
Well, one of us holds her
down and the other one just...

25:15.201 --> 25:16.490
OK.

25:16.535 --> 25:18.017
And who does what?

25:20.162 --> 25:22.734
This isn't just about
poking holes in her.

25:22.915 --> 25:25.230
We're talking about murder, right?

25:26.212 --> 25:28.857
- Done it before, so...
- Sonia? Nah.

25:29.265 --> 25:31.638
You were protecting
Liz. It wasn't planned.

25:31.650 --> 25:33.500
This is cold-blooded.

25:33.512 --> 25:36.560
- Same as what you did to Drago.
- Nothing cold about that.

25:37.485 --> 25:39.403
I was out of my mind.

25:39.887 --> 25:41.669
And killing like that?

25:42.441 --> 25:43.950
Besides, I can't be linked to it.

25:43.984 --> 25:45.703
Fuck up any chance of
me getting out of here.

25:45.727 --> 25:49.280
And Jackson will put me in
isolation to rot, away from Ru.

25:51.551 --> 25:52.987
Poison her gear.

25:53.027 --> 25:56.001
Tried that once, doesn't
work 'cos she doesn't inject,

25:56.012 --> 25:58.692
so that's too hard.

26:00.503 --> 26:02.223
It's easy to say it, eh?

26:08.240 --> 26:11.020
So, if we're not gonna shiv her,
drug her, bash her brains out

26:11.021 --> 26:12.900
and you don't want to get made for it...

26:13.552 --> 26:15.301
... then how?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.041
Conqueror special.

26:33.751 --> 26:36.796
- Couple of ring-ins?
- Cleaning detail's popular today.

26:36.921 --> 26:38.868
Cost you 50 if you want to join.

26:38.993 --> 26:40.656
No, thanks.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.278
Hey, Miss Miles?

26:43.505 --> 26:45.089
I think my spray bottle's broken.

26:45.117 --> 26:47.552
- Why?
- I dunno, something caught in the bottle.

26:48.159 --> 26:50.152
- It's not spraying.
- OK.

27:32.862 --> 27:35.059
We just need to get some fertilizer.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.642
- Got Liz on it.
- What?

27:36.659 --> 27:38.158
Gardening detail.

27:38.397 --> 27:40.020
Oh, fuck me.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.875
Made some great progress
with Boomer today.

27:48.887 --> 27:52.686
- She's a ripper!
- Yes! She is full of beans.

27:54.984 --> 27:58.310
Have you had a look at
Elizabeth Birdsworth's file,

27:58.323 --> 28:00.963
- by any chance?
- No, not yet.

28:01.261 --> 28:04.746
Well, I've just been
looking at her medical bills.

28:04.774 --> 28:06.971
They're quite substantial,
which shouldn't matter.

28:07.408 --> 28:10.144
But I'm just wondering if there's
anything more we can do for her.

28:11.148 --> 28:13.754
- She's on sodium selenate?
- Mm-hm.

28:14.588 --> 28:16.257
Yeah, maybe there is.

28:16.444 --> 28:17.943
The drug I'm trialling here

28:17.971 --> 28:20.071
targets the same areas of the brain.

28:20.247 --> 28:22.847
It could have secondary
effects on other brain functions

28:22.853 --> 28:25.071
that might relieve her symptoms.

28:25.196 --> 28:26.860
I can talk to her if you'd like me to.

28:26.888 --> 28:28.222
OK, erm...

28:28.239 --> 28:30.425
... I think work unit's almost
finished. Are you free now?

28:30.447 --> 28:31.929
Yeah.

28:55.236 --> 28:56.752
Rit, she's here.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.323
Hey!

29:00.867 --> 29:02.296
Did you get it?

29:03.080 --> 29:05.406
- Get what?
- The fertilizer.

29:05.483 --> 29:07.092
Aw, you shouldn't have trusted someone

29:07.109 --> 29:08.983
who's losing their marbles, love.

29:11.077 --> 29:12.553
Is that enough?

29:12.678 --> 29:14.029
Cheeky bitch.

29:18.348 --> 29:20.102
What are you growing, girls?

29:20.136 --> 29:21.697
Oh, cactus, Liz.

29:21.952 --> 29:23.615
Well...

29:23.740 --> 29:26.601
- *
- This is dangerous.

29:28.122 --> 29:29.802
Gotta be careful.

29:33.417 --> 29:35.867
- Liz?
- Fuck!

29:36.957 --> 29:38.495
Hey! Miss Bennett!

29:38.518 --> 29:39.892
Ah!

29:40.017 --> 29:42.276
Liz! Ladies.

29:42.747 --> 29:45.358
Dr Miller wants a word with you.

29:45.687 --> 29:49.181
- The new prison psychiatrist.
- What does he want with me?

29:49.238 --> 29:51.878
Does he wanna stick
me in the psych unit?

29:51.901 --> 29:54.591
No. He just wants to
discuss your medication.

29:54.824 --> 29:57.555
- Well, no, thanks, I'll pass.
- Oh, Liz!

29:58.105 --> 29:59.745
Dr Miller wants to help you.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.675
- Someone say Dr Miller?
- Yes.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.497
He wants to go over Liz's
course of treatment with her.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.043
Oh.

30:06.591 --> 30:09.858
Oh, yeah! He's real nice,
Liz, you'll love him!

30:09.915 --> 30:12.843
And he's, like, really hot,
too, isn't he, Miss Bennett?

30:12.883 --> 30:14.499
Yeah. Wouldn't know about that.

30:14.528 --> 30:17.692
Liz, I promise you have nothing to fear.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.697
Come on. He's waiting for us now.

30:24.655 --> 30:26.522
Oh, fuck.

30:26.698 --> 30:28.396
I'm sorry if I sound
like a broken record,

30:28.413 --> 30:30.292
but if you could just be...

30:32.738 --> 30:34.418
Yeah, yeah...

30:36.683 --> 30:37.758
She's been showing signs

30:37.772 --> 30:39.812
- of deterioration for some time, now.
- Yeah, sure.

30:45.494 --> 30:47.601
Hi, Liz. I'm Dr Miller.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.990
We met when I first arrived.

30:50.450 --> 30:52.119
You want my help?

30:53.736 --> 30:56.717
Actually, I was hoping
that maybe I could help you.

30:56.842 --> 31:00.650
You see, I'm trialling a drug as
part of my research here that may,

31:00.667 --> 31:02.398
in fact, benefit you.

31:03.546 --> 31:05.016
We've been here before.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.064
Yeah, you may have had sessions
with the previous psychologist.

31:10.676 --> 31:12.338
You're trying to trick me!

31:12.372 --> 31:14.608
- No, this is...
- ... Sonia's really latched on you.

31:14.631 --> 31:15.748
... I only want to help you.

31:15.772 --> 31:18.020
Yeah, that's what you said last time!

31:18.219 --> 31:20.927
- Last time?
- Yeah! What do you take me for?!

31:20.966 --> 31:22.737
Where's the coffee and the muffin?!

31:22.760 --> 31:25.082
And if you try and kiss me again

31:25.139 --> 31:27.296
- I will punch you in the nuts!
- Liz, I...

31:27.301 --> 31:30.270
- Sit down please.
- Miss Bennett! Miss Bennett!

31:30.298 --> 31:32.830
He is trying to seduce me.

31:32.852 --> 31:35.798
And he wants me to tell
lies about Sonia Stevens!

31:35.804 --> 31:37.603
- Oh, Liz, please...
- You tell Don

31:37.620 --> 31:40.663
I will not be made a
bloody fool of again!

31:40.680 --> 31:43.484
- Please!
- Liz, listen to me, that's not Don. That's not Don.

31:43.552 --> 31:45.403
No, that's not Don Kaplan.

31:46.061 --> 31:47.270
That is Dr Miller.

31:47.293 --> 31:48.645
- Dr Miller?
- Dr Miller.

31:48.911 --> 31:50.644
- Dr Miller.
- The new psychiatrist.

31:50.769 --> 31:52.732
That's Dr Miller? He...

31:53.221 --> 31:55.878
- You're Dr Miller?
- Yeah, that's right, Liz.

31:56.003 --> 31:57.898
OK, Liz, why don't you sit down?

31:58.153 --> 31:59.935
Sit down and just, um...

32:00.185 --> 32:02.364
- ... just hear what Dr Miller has to say.
- Yeah.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.391
I'll hear what he has to say.

32:04.970 --> 32:07.541
I'll explain to you later.

32:09.016 --> 32:12.563
- Dr Miller.
- Yeah, that's right, Liz. I'm Dr Miller.

32:13.344 --> 32:15.041
So...

32:15.873 --> 32:18.239
I think it's just his eyes.

32:18.425 --> 32:19.628
They're green.

32:19.878 --> 32:23.270
Yeah, he's got some nice eyes.

32:24.873 --> 32:25.899
Hey.

32:25.913 --> 32:28.079
- Oh, what do you want?
- I want to talk to Ruby.

32:28.088 --> 32:30.631
Too bad, so sad. We're trainin'.

32:30.654 --> 32:32.975
- Ruby?
- Oh, are you deaf?

32:33.914 --> 32:36.180
Boomer, I got this.

32:38.319 --> 32:40.371
What's going on with
Kaz and your sister?

32:40.784 --> 32:42.119
They're up to something.

32:42.555 --> 32:43.912
Is it about Marie?

32:44.193 --> 32:46.505
Whoa, you're paranoid.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.723
They've been stealing chemicals.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.250
I saw them.

32:53.588 --> 32:55.895
I think Kaz is going
to poison Marie again.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.599
I don't know anything about that.

33:07.138 --> 33:08.323
Hey.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.892
I'll check it out.

33:42.567 --> 33:44.433
Shouldn't be snooping, Ru.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.811
Do you want to stay in
here for bloody ever?

33:49.419 --> 33:51.122
What are you getting mixed up in?

33:51.631 --> 33:52.803
Huh?!

33:54.297 --> 33:55.873
You're taking out Marie?

33:57.104 --> 33:58.539
Are you crazy?!

33:58.664 --> 33:59.783
She killed Ray.

33:59.908 --> 34:01.359
Got one of her followers to do it.

34:01.397 --> 34:03.058
- Revenge for Drago.
- So?!

34:03.081 --> 34:05.519
So?! She's got to pay, Ru!

34:05.553 --> 34:07.960
Ray's spirit, he can't move
on! He's being held back!

34:07.983 --> 34:09.397
I owe it to him!

34:09.418 --> 34:11.710
- You talking about Old Man Crow?
- Yeah!

34:11.955 --> 34:13.397
It's not that.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.542
You know Kosta's getting dead birds

34:15.576 --> 34:19.005
dropped in the yard from
drones packed with drugs?

34:19.914 --> 34:21.259
Yeah.

34:21.299 --> 34:24.119
So, forget about the bloody
crow, and forget about this.

34:27.996 --> 34:29.824
I know what I know.

34:29.853 --> 34:31.563
And I know what I saw.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.906
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You'll get caught.

34:33.925 --> 34:35.931
- No!
- Yes, you will!

34:36.743 --> 34:39.411
Rita! You'll never get out of here!

34:39.702 --> 34:41.904
And, you know, we'll never be together!

34:44.146 --> 34:46.283
I finally got my sister back.

34:50.014 --> 34:52.083
I can't lose you again.

35:03.253 --> 35:05.338
Basic eight step, eh?

35:05.377 --> 35:08.113
Yeah, I'm not so sure
it's gonna be so basic.

35:08.130 --> 35:11.283
Er, hello? How hard is it
to follow some pictures?

35:13.313 --> 35:14.799
Back on the right foot!

35:14.828 --> 35:16.661
- Whose right?
- Well, who's the bloke?

35:16.690 --> 35:17.865
- He is!
- Duh!

35:17.870 --> 35:20.198
Well, "duh", then! It's your right!

35:20.215 --> 35:21.435
OK, back on the...

35:21.452 --> 35:22.554
- OK.
- Ooh!

35:22.565 --> 35:24.723
I know. It says here, "No touching."

35:24.763 --> 35:26.793
So, you've got to be close

35:26.794 --> 35:28.082
- but not too close.
- Not too close.

35:28.105 --> 35:29.552
- Yeah. That's it. Yeah.
- So, that's too close.

35:29.570 --> 35:31.538
I think it's about the
space between your body.

35:31.577 --> 35:33.745
- I don't understand what that means!
- That's all right!

35:33.769 --> 35:35.715
- It's just that bit here.
- Just give it a shot!

35:35.727 --> 35:37.197
- OK, Lizzie?
- Yes?

35:37.214 --> 35:39.326
- Forward on your left foot.
- OK. Yeah.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.858
After three. One, two, three...

35:41.883 --> 35:43.186
Four! Oh!

35:43.203 --> 35:44.323
Aw! I don't think that was...

35:44.342 --> 35:45.468
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, see? No touching!

35:45.477 --> 35:47.257
- Oh! Sorry, love.
- Jesus.

35:47.271 --> 35:50.143
- All right.
- OK. Back, side, forward, forward, cross.

35:50.193 --> 35:52.492
Forward, cross... Oh, no, wait a minute.

35:52.523 --> 35:54.189
- You said, "Back, side."
- Oh, Jesus,

35:54.202 --> 35:56.693
- I'm dancing with a demented...
- Oh, come on!

35:56.700 --> 35:58.651
Boomer! Boomer, take a break.

35:58.658 --> 36:01.177
- Have some Monte Carlos or something.
- No!

36:01.227 --> 36:06.594
I'm practising the impulse restraint
thing for hot doc, all right? So...

36:06.719 --> 36:09.528
All right, ladies, it's getting
late. Turn the music off, please.

36:09.549 --> 36:10.979
- Oh...
- Oh, for God's sake!

36:11.002 --> 36:12.950
You heard me, go on! Tango off to bed.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.483
You know how to tango?

36:17.643 --> 36:19.108
Music off.

36:19.936 --> 36:21.662
Well, what if we don't
want to turn it off?

36:21.690 --> 36:23.790
Well, maybe I'll just slot
you for disobedience, Jenkins.

36:23.802 --> 36:26.475
- Oh, no, no, no. We'll turn it off, Mr Stewart.
- No, no,

36:26.498 --> 36:27.803
don't worry about it.

36:29.052 --> 36:31.798
Look, it's for Liz's bucket list.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.939
- Bucket list?
- Yeah, things to do...

36:35.421 --> 36:37.803
... you know, before she
can't remember anything.

36:42.199 --> 36:45.123
Hey, I need you to fix
me up with some gear.

36:45.163 --> 36:47.149
- Piss off!
- Come on, I just need another bundle!

36:47.160 --> 36:48.585
I've got no bloody gear.

36:48.613 --> 36:51.820
- Just a teenth then?
- And get fucking steam pressed by Kaz?

36:51.843 --> 36:54.177
- Screw you.
- Fuck you!

37:09.593 --> 37:11.364
I thought you said you didn't need it.

37:11.489 --> 37:12.982
I don't, it's just...

37:13.192 --> 37:15.565
Need to get over this hump, that's all.

37:15.690 --> 37:18.199
The fucking Greek next
door gave me jack shit.

37:18.221 --> 37:19.839
Kaz has got to her.

37:20.066 --> 37:22.771
- Well, can't you get something in?
- Yeah, from where?

37:23.985 --> 37:26.903
- Fuck, I hate seeing you like this.
- Well, fucking help me!

37:26.932 --> 37:28.902
- How?
- Well, I know you got some

37:28.913 --> 37:30.775
of the girls on your call list.

37:31.115 --> 37:33.875
Yeah, to call. As friends.

37:33.904 --> 37:36.723
- Come on, just this one time. Please, Allie.
- Fuck that!

37:37.458 --> 37:38.821
Do it yourself!

37:38.849 --> 37:40.909
Fucking how?! I've got
no-one on the outside!

37:40.954 --> 37:42.398
Right? I've got nothing.

37:42.686 --> 37:44.905
All right? They've all
just fucking abandoned me.

37:45.115 --> 37:48.464
All right? No-one gives a shit
about me any more. Or Danny.

37:51.212 --> 37:52.920
Please, Allie?

37:53.210 --> 37:55.111
Sweetheart, just...

37:55.792 --> 37:58.958
Just one... one time. That's it.

38:01.228 --> 38:04.363
You're putting heroin in front of me.

38:04.854 --> 38:06.799
Knowing my history.

38:08.693 --> 38:12.751
- Are you seriously asking me to do this?
- Oh, God, no.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.809
Oh, shit.

38:17.931 --> 38:19.414
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

38:19.449 --> 38:22.470
I should never have asked
you to do that. I'm sorry.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.517
Allie, I am so...

38:26.840 --> 38:28.843
... sorry, Allie.

38:29.576 --> 38:31.455
It's so wrong, I...

38:31.580 --> 38:33.453
I'm not thinking straight.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.159
Look...

38:38.657 --> 38:40.167
OK, I'll...

38:40.292 --> 38:41.926
I'll do it. Just...

38:42.920 --> 38:45.839
... this one time, OK?
That's it. Never again.

38:46.702 --> 38:48.875
You got to sort this shit out, Marie.

38:49.386 --> 38:50.970
I will.

38:59.559 --> 39:01.784
- That coming from H1?
- Yep.

40:54.392 --> 40:55.686
What?

40:56.253 --> 40:57.826
I'm out.

40:59.671 --> 41:01.978
- Why?
- Risk of getting caught.

41:02.568 --> 41:04.209
Can't do it to Ru.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.719
Can't do it without you.

41:05.844 --> 41:08.095
Then don't. It's not worth it.

41:10.632 --> 41:12.163
What about Ray?

41:13.181 --> 41:14.763
Ray's gone.

41:15.321 --> 41:17.660
Killing Marie won't bring him back.

41:42.483 --> 41:43.930
Hey.

41:46.496 --> 41:47.705
Hey.

41:47.983 --> 41:50.628
Whatever Rita and Kaz
are up to, it's over.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.944
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

41:54.891 --> 41:56.373
Thank you.

41:56.498 --> 41:57.923
It's OK.

42:01.709 --> 42:02.997
Ruby...

42:03.060 --> 42:04.336
Hurry up, Novak.

42:04.370 --> 42:05.923
Got a visitor.

42:34.215 --> 42:37.439
... Which brings me to the
position of acting deputy governor.

42:37.473 --> 42:41.021
I'd like to thank everyone who took
the time to interview for the job.

42:41.032 --> 42:44.518
You were all very impressive but,
er, it was a very hard decision.

42:44.552 --> 42:47.537
But congratulations to the
new acting deputy governor,

42:47.764 --> 42:50.536
- Linda Miles.
- Woo-hoo!

42:52.692 --> 42:54.372
Well done, Linda.

42:57.380 --> 42:59.009
Thanks.

43:00.150 --> 43:01.633
What the fuck, man?

43:01.650 --> 43:04.993
There was no way I was ever
gonna make you my 2IC, Jake.

43:11.163 --> 43:13.087
Well, that must be a relief!

43:13.149 --> 43:16.238
Handover's complete now, you
can look forward to your leave.

43:16.470 --> 43:17.647
Yeah.

43:17.675 --> 43:20.643
Listen, if you have any
spare time before that, erm,

43:20.711 --> 43:23.282
- I could really use your help running my programme.
- My help?

43:23.327 --> 43:25.847
Yeah, the way you handled
Liz and Boomer, I mean,

43:26.040 --> 43:29.538
you have an understanding of these
prisoners that I just don't have.

43:29.663 --> 43:32.159
- They obviously respond to you.
- That'd be ridiculous.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.902
Vera isn't anybody's assistant.

43:34.027 --> 43:36.721
- Oh, no, no, I wasn't meaning that.
- Oh, I'd love to help you, Greg.

43:36.745 --> 43:39.830
- In fact, I'd consider it an honour.
- Great.

44:27.844 --> 44:29.487
How was your visit?

44:30.514 --> 44:32.507
You still feel something.

44:34.437 --> 44:36.106
Tell me I'm wrong.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.244
Allie, you're with Marie.

44:41.635 --> 44:43.258
Yeah, 'cos you dumped me.

44:43.297 --> 44:45.290
Because you dobbed on your best friend!

44:45.363 --> 44:47.123
I couldn't trust you!

44:49.081 --> 44:50.687
Miss you.

44:53.356 --> 44:55.468
You just want to be with someone.

44:56.257 --> 44:58.783
And, if it's not me, then it's Marie.

44:59.305 --> 45:01.433
If it's not Marie,
then it's someone else.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.341
And whoever that someone else is,

45:03.386 --> 45:05.684
you'll find a way to sabotage that, too.

45:07.910 --> 45:09.284
Yeah, you're right.

45:09.772 --> 45:11.628
No, I'm the problem, not you.

45:11.895 --> 45:13.354
Not Marie.

45:16.283 --> 45:19.264
- 'Cos I'm weak.
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

45:19.389 --> 45:20.848
No, I am.

45:22.278 --> 45:24.503
I'm fucking useless.

45:24.532 --> 45:26.672
You don't trust me and Marie...

45:29.714 --> 45:32.275
Marie thinks I'm worth less than...

45:34.148 --> 45:35.936
Less than what?

45:41.437 --> 45:43.197
Doesn't matter.

45:44.429 --> 45:45.893
Allie.

45:46.308 --> 45:48.005
Allie!

46:25.548 --> 46:28.145
No! No, no, no!

46:28.180 --> 46:29.805
Kaz, what the... ?!

46:29.869 --> 46:32.594
- Kaz, it's not...
- Shit!

46:32.719 --> 46:34.417
It's not mine.

46:34.758 --> 46:36.829
Kaz! Kaz...

46:37.249 --> 46:38.909
Please, I need it.

46:38.937 --> 46:41.263
But it's not yours.

46:42.989 --> 46:44.472
It's for Marie.

46:44.486 --> 46:46.657
Then why have you got
your fucking nose in one?

46:47.360 --> 46:49.687
Where did you get this shit?

46:57.123 --> 46:58.953
No, bubba...

46:59.078 --> 47:02.508
You shut off her supply
with Kosta, I had no choice!

47:02.537 --> 47:05.197
- You have a choice.
- Fuck sake, Kaz, it was just one time.

47:05.254 --> 47:07.450
No, that's how it starts, Allie.
That's how she sucks you in,

47:07.474 --> 47:09.160
- just like she sucked you in last time.
- No, no, no...

47:09.184 --> 47:11.194
Yes, because this is how
Marie binds you to her,

47:11.217 --> 47:13.379
- it's what she does.
- Why do you care?!

47:13.407 --> 47:16.558
- It is what she does!
- You slapped my fucking face!

47:18.454 --> 47:20.350
You cut me off!

47:21.724 --> 47:23.841
You gave me no option.

47:24.187 --> 47:26.679
You gave me nowhere to go.

47:28.918 --> 47:31.303
You did this to me.

48:38.459 --> 48:41.257
LET ME OUT! FUCKING...

48:41.904 --> 48:44.698
FUCK YOU! KAZ, BURN IN HELL!

48:44.823 --> 48:46.644
YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD!

48:49.193 --> 48:51.333
Oh, shit!

49:16.018 --> 49:17.709
I had to protect Allie.

49:18.737 --> 49:22.058
You're stating in isolation,
for everyone's safety.

49:23.619 --> 49:27.138
Fights are breaking out all over
the prison. It's gonna get worse.

49:28.189 --> 49:30.845
I don't want anything to do with you.
