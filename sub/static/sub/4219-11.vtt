WEBVTT

00:43.961 --> 00:45.128
You're up early.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.255
Hey.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.633
Yeah, I went for a run,
showered up, made some coffee.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.593
A little nervous energy maybe?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.762
No, no. I'm cool.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.973
Then why are you organizing
my T-shirt drawer?

01:01.812 --> 01:03.730
A little nervous, yeah.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.606
You're gonna be fine.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.483
So are you.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.695
Yeah, I'm ready to get back.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.740
Doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.785
Baby? Hey, hey!

01:17.911 --> 01:21.247
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey! You OK?
- Oh!

01:21.373 --> 01:23.124
Don't do that!
Don't do that again.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.126
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.966
Hey, I was thinking about coming by the
house before reporting to the Academy.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.509
I just feel like we should tell people

01:33.635 --> 01:35.344
before they hear about it
from somebody else.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.639
Tell them...

01:38.766 --> 01:40.933
You are cruising, I swear to God.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.268
Are you kidding?

01:42.394 --> 01:45.897
I want the whole world
to know that you're my girl.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.738
Hey, let me tell Mills, OK?

01:54.865 --> 01:57.784
Just out of respect.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.243
Yeah, sure.

02:02.331 --> 02:06.083
Policies, procedures, class roster.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.960
It's all there. Riveting stuff.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.879
Any knuckleheads
I need to know about?

02:10.005 --> 02:13.007
They're recruits.
Put them through their paces.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.676
If they can't pull it off,
give them the boot.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.428
That's what the Academy is for.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.224
So even though I'm only
teaching one class, I can do that?

02:21.350 --> 02:23.935
- Yep.
- Sounds good.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.394
How are things over at 51?

02:25.521 --> 02:29.065
Great. Busy.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.901
I understand one of your guys
is mixed up in a murder case?

02:33.362 --> 02:36.823
Yeah, we're still trying to
wrap our heads around that one.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.742
I'll see you tomorrow, Chief.

02:44.748 --> 02:45.915
How long do I have to wear this?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.626
Till your trial's over.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.670
Unless you want to tell me
what happened that night

02:50.796 --> 02:52.338
and we avoid a trial altogether.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.593
You'll have to talk to my lawyer,
I've got nothing to say.

02:58.762 --> 02:59.804
See you in court, then.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.311
Yeah! I called it! I called it!
Did I not call it?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.563
No.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.731
Oh, yeah, I told Cindy.
But, hey, I called it.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.733
I knew you two
were meant for each other.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.402
Me too! Randy McHolland!

03:14.528 --> 03:16.612
I knew you guys were going to be
turtledoves one day.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.907
- It all worked out. Thanks, guys.
- Happy for you.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.784
Hey, I'm in your rescue class tomorrow.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.536
I saw that.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.831
- Don't give me any special treatment.
- Don't worry.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.710
Er...

03:30.836 --> 03:33.588
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.172
Hey, Mills.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.592
What's up, Dawson? Hey, big day today.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.844
Oh, yeah. Yeah, erm...

03:40.846 --> 03:42.805
Hey, you got a sec?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.100
I want you to be happy.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.977
That's all I ever wanted.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.688
And I'm glad you found the guy
who could do that for you.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.067
Thank you.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.868
Hey, er, kick some ass at the Academy.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.828
I plan on it.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.267
Lieutenant?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.561
Boden wants everybody
in the Briefing Room.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.397
Yeah, I'm just gonna change out.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.690
Be right there.

04:45.661 --> 04:50.247
OK! I have just heard from CPD.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.833
Clarke is out on bond.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.877
He'll remain on suspension
until further notice.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.046
That's crazy if he did it.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.881
If? The round came from his gun.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.093
The bullets came from a type of gun that
Clarke owns. Get your facts straight.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.594
I stand corrected.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.888
Enough. Clarke comes to
this house for any reason,

05:06.014 --> 05:09.141
he is innocent until proven guilty.
We treat him like a brother.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.726
He's not gonna come by. I talked to him.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.603
He doesn't want to
make anyone uncomfortable.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.146
Then moving on,

05:14.272 --> 05:15.898
I'd like you all to give
a nice, warm welcome

05:16.024 --> 05:17.525
to our new Paramedic-in-Charge,

05:17.651 --> 05:19.402
Miss Allison Rafferty.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.070
Hey, guys.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.197
I look forward to working with you all.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.657
Welcome aboard, kid.

05:24.783 --> 05:25.950
Tell us about yourself.

05:26.076 --> 05:30.079
Well, I was over at 24 before I
came here, but I've been in Chicago...

05:31.415 --> 05:33.624
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.584
Battalion 25, single-car accident...

05:35.711 --> 05:37.294
Hey, Rafferty, I'm Shay.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.171
I'm gonna be your partner.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.965
Yeah. Heard a lot about you.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.646
Oh, man, I've never seen
nothing like that before.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.690
- This dude came just out of nowhere.
- Anybody hit?

05:57.816 --> 05:59.859
- No, man. The driver...
- Out of the way, guys.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.129
We got a blown-out tyre
on the front passenger side.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.465
Let's get some cribbing in here
and stabilise this car.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.092
Pressure's 80 palp. Heart rate 120.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.219
Alright, airway's clear.
No sign of a bleed.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.889
OK, listen. He got real lucky.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.391
The rebar's probably
sitting right on his carotid.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.018
Be super careful when you move him.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.395
I mean, a millimetre
in the wrong direction, OK?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.981
Only way he's coming out
is if we cut that rebar on either side.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.775
- You stabilise, I cut?
- Alright.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.777
Capp, shears!

06:44.112 --> 06:46.405
- What's your name?
- Jeremy.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.865
My name's Matt.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.992
We're gonna do this together, alright?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.619
Here we go.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.793
- Stop! Stop!
- It's OK.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.378
We'll figure out another way.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.173
The shears are torquing the rebar.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.883
It'll push that rod through his carotid.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.843
We've got to use
something else to cut it.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.512
Saw's out of the question.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.098
- Vibrations could hit that artery.
- What about a torch?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.101
We'd be taking a chance with the heat.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.103
- Chief, what do you think?
- Get the torch.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.564
Capp! Give me that blanket.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.860
His heart rate is elevated.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.779
You gotta keep him calm,
or he'll go into V-tach.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.864
Right.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.825
OK, Jeremy, just take it easy.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.076
We're gonna get you out.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.502
I'm gonna die.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.712
You're not. OK?

07:43.839 --> 07:46.549
I was in your exact same spot
six weeks ago.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.259
One breath at a time.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.096
OK, other side.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.935
I'm gonna die.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.939
Jeremy, I bet you a six-pack
you make it through this.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.526
It'll be the best beer you ever tasted

08:05.652 --> 08:08.070
cos you'll be so glad you're alive
while you're drinking it.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.368
Fight through it.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.703
You got to want to live.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.705
- You can do this.
- OK.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.916
OK.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.211
Alright, he's good to go!

08:26.298 --> 08:27.381
Gently.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.801
- Easy! Easy, keep him stable.
- Lower. OK.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.678
Good.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.893
Alright, let's go.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.775
Welcome back, Lieutenant.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.702
Mouch, while you were out...

08:57.662 --> 09:01.165
- Thank you, Connie. You look nice.
- Oh!

09:01.291 --> 09:05.002
Boden's not gonna take too kindly
to you hijacking his assistant.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.005
Now, not everybody knows
Randy McHolland's number yet.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.591
Besides, this is all union business.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.259
Ultimately, this benefits the Chief.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.724
Is it me, or does he have
a screw loose lately?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.059
Herrmann?

09:20.185 --> 09:22.394
Did you forget to pay a bill
or something?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.313
No. Why?

09:24.439 --> 09:28.692
Well, Molly's just got this letter
from the Union Financing Corporation

09:28.818 --> 09:31.403
asking for our financial records.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.365
Oh, yeah, this could be a major problem.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.826
- Yeah.
- Or, Otis, it could be a scam.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.830
Or, Herrmann,
if you'd bothered to read

09:41.957 --> 09:43.290
the contents of the letter,

09:43.416 --> 09:47.586
you'd see that they're sending
representatives to meet us in person.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.924
They have a phone number and
their business address is legitimate.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.576
So, how'd you end up in Chicago?

10:19.703 --> 10:23.080
Oh, my dad got accepted
to Northwestern.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.041
Yeah, he went back to school
after my parents had all five kids.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.626
My mom was a nurse

10:27.752 --> 10:29.753
and she put my dad through school.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.506
Sounds like you've got a great mom.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.300
Yeah, for sure.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.218
Hey, can I have seconds?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.137
Help yourself.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.538
My name's Gabriela Dawson...

11:04.664 --> 11:07.583
Yes. Pick up your uniform, gear
and locker assignment in Room A.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.793
And report for roll call
in the drill hall.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.913
In here! My friend's inside!
They just left her on the table.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.045
I was waiting outside
while the doctor was working on her.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.464
And then I saw him
run out and get in his car.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.508
That bastard just took off!

12:12.148 --> 12:13.440
What's your friend's name?

12:13.566 --> 12:14.858
Shelly. I'm Tina.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.069
What exactly is going on here, Tina?

12:17.195 --> 12:18.821
She was getting some work done, but...

12:18.947 --> 12:20.656
He wasn't a real doctor, was he?

12:20.782 --> 12:23.909
Doctors don't generally buy their
medical supplies from Home Depot.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.912
He was filling her with
silicone and cement.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.997
Heart rate's 50, borderline brady.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.250
She's allergic to something
in this cocktail.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.293
Give me an airway.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.555
You're in.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.640
She's going into V-fib.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.475
- Do something!
- Stand back, Tina.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.977
Alright, prepare to shock!

12:50.895 --> 12:51.895
Shocking!

12:54.232 --> 12:55.441
Pushing epi.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.695
She's still in V-fib.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.238
Shocking.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.829
We got a pulse!

13:14.252 --> 13:16.420
OK, it's official, I've seen everything.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.715
I mean, don't get me wrong,

13:19.841 --> 13:21.800
I like a big caboose
as much as the next guy.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.887
But how do you pay
a charlatan 1,500 bucks

13:25.013 --> 13:28.640
to pump construction
adhesive into your ass?

13:29.559 --> 13:32.060
I mean, have you ever
been on a call like that before?

13:32.187 --> 13:33.687
A back-alley plastic surgeon?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.023
I haven't.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.444
Hey, Rafferty, have we ever
worked together before?

13:40.570 --> 13:41.778
No.

13:41.905 --> 13:46.533
Did I, like, er, steal your seat
at a CFD barbecue or something?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.368
Not that I recall.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.662
Then how come you're so
warm and friendly with everybody,

13:50.788 --> 13:52.372
but I get the ice queen?

13:53.708 --> 13:55.459
OK.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.963
I had this partner over at 24.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.174
Brenda Billings, maybe you know her?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.592
No.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.844
She would make calls to her girlfriend

14:05.970 --> 14:09.640
that would sometimes
get a little graphic.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.600
I was friendly with her
and I guess she read that

14:11.726 --> 14:13.644
as an invitation to say
whatever was on her mind,

14:13.770 --> 14:15.103
appropriate or otherwise.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.524
Bottom line, I respect
your lifestyle choice,

14:18.650 --> 14:20.984
I just don't want it shoved in my face.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.163
Attention, candidates...

14:33.289 --> 14:34.331
Hey.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.124
- Hi, I'm Gabriela Dawson.
- Rebecca Jones.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.544
You work with Lieutenant Severide
over at 51, right?

14:38.670 --> 14:39.670
I did, yeah.

14:39.796 --> 14:43.006
A lot of the other instructors
got canned from their houses.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.676
They're totally padding the faculty
to keep these guys employed.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.010
It's kind of sad.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.804
Actually, a lot of the guys
who got let go,

14:48.930 --> 14:50.514
their houses
were shut down by the state.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.765
It's not their fault.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.017
Yeah, but there's got to be
a reason some houses closed.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.603
Only the tough ones survive, right?

14:59.482 --> 15:02.693
Alright, candidates,
let's move it!

15:02.819 --> 15:06.613
Hup! Hup! Speed, let's go!

15:06.739 --> 15:11.034
Let's do it! Come on! Come on! Too slow!

15:11.160 --> 15:12.911
Let's go, people!

15:15.290 --> 15:18.292
Class... ten-hut!

15:20.753 --> 15:24.673
Candidates, welcome to
the Chicago Fire Academy.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
How long to make it?

15:29.846 --> 15:31.763
Everyone chips in? Three weeks.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.391
You know, I don't have a
whole lot of construction experience.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.726
Can you swing a hammer?

15:35.852 --> 15:38.812
I get it, this is your chance to be
my boss and yell at me on a job site.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.814
Yes, that's true. I won't deny that.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.483
But in the process we get to make this.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.861
All we need is the space to work.

15:45.987 --> 15:49.114
I got a buddy over at the boat yard
probably has a dry dock that'll work.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.699
Then we're off and running.

15:52.744 --> 15:56.538
Hey, you good?
No after-effects or anything?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.457
Never better.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.586
Hey, Lieutenant, can I duck out for a
couple minutes? I'll keep my radio on.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.004
Everything alright?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.131
Yeah. Clarke.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.345
Hey, Otis.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.764
Hey. Katie, hi.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.642
Hi. I'm just dropping off
some chocolate chip cookies.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.602
Kelly really likes the ones that I make.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.646
Or he's blowing smoke
up my ass. Who knows?

16:20.772 --> 16:23.982
Either way, I made
a double batch for everybody.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.192
Mmm!

16:25.318 --> 16:27.486
Are you still living with him and Shay?

16:27.612 --> 16:30.155
Er, moving out, actually.

16:30.281 --> 16:33.200
Oh. I'm gonna be there for dinner
on Wednesday.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.534
Ah!

16:34.661 --> 16:36.995
Cruz and I have a movie date.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.539
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is this?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.833
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
Here, just take the cookies.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.627
This is Settlers of Catan.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.338
Don't front,
like you know the game.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.632
Created in Germany,

16:48.758 --> 16:51.718
originally called
Die Siedler von Catan. That game?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.098
Don't mess with me.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.767
Grain or ore? What do you trade for?

16:58.893 --> 17:01.895
Well, it depends on if I'm playing
Seafarers or Cities and Knights,

17:02.021 --> 17:03.522
but as a general rule, grain, of course.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.732
You can't win the game without grain.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.571
You should come to dinner on Wednesday.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.283
I'd love to.

17:17.578 --> 17:21.248
- Chief, you need me?
- Yeah, a lawyer contacted me.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.876
McHolland. Can't talk.
In a meeting. Can't talk.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.345
Please sit down.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.809
A lawyer contacted the union
looking to talk to you.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.686
Regarding?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.896
Darryl Bell's suicide.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.402
Er, what about it?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.696
Didn't say.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.656
Refused, rather.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.283
Here's the attorney's information.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.621
I don't want it. They can, er...

18:04.167 --> 18:05.834
They can subpoena me, or...

18:05.960 --> 18:07.794
Whatever this is about,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.422
the union is behind you 100%.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.133
I'll be there for you personally
until you hire your own attorney,

18:13.259 --> 18:14.301
if it comes to that.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.013
Listen to me.
Please do not let this shake you.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.849
What happened to Darryl was a tragedy,

18:20.975 --> 18:23.143
but it was his, not yours.

18:23.269 --> 18:27.063
Your union, your chief,
your family here at 51,

18:27.190 --> 18:29.858
we are all right behind you
every step of the way.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.871
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.706
What's up, Pete?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.876
Alright, look,
you're friends with Clarke, right?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.086
What is this about?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.548
We're trying to get through to him,
but he's in full jarhead mode.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.760
The longer he keeps his mouth shut,
the better he looks for this murder.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.178
OK.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.763
You didn't get this from us.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.641
And the only reason we're doing this
is because we're all family here.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.435
We finally got access to
Hayes' phone records.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.978
Went through his texts.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.325
- Lisa was cheating on you with Hayes.
- Leave now, Mills. Now!

19:20.451 --> 19:22.285
I've seen the texts
where she's calling him out.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.454
"Who is this new slut
you're parading around town?"

19:24.580 --> 19:26.998
Dude, she is jealous.
She's jealous and this?

19:27.124 --> 19:28.917
This is a day before he was killed, man.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.418
First of all, what are you, a cop now?

19:30.545 --> 19:32.546
Where the hell did you see these texts,
huh?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.589
Hayes was not coming around
cos she owed him money.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.966
She wanted him around, alright?

19:36.092 --> 19:38.468
And when he found somebody new,
she didn't like it.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.054
Alright, you came down here
and you said what you had to say.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.639
I'm telling you one more time.

19:42.765 --> 19:43.765
Leave.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.434
She's letting you take this ride

19:46.561 --> 19:48.353
and you do not even know
the whole story!

19:49.939 --> 19:51.690
I'm telling you,
you better walk away, Mills.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.025
You better walk away
before I lay you out!

19:56.821 --> 19:57.863
Fine.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.292
CFD going to take a little trip!

20:10.418 --> 20:13.169
CFD going to take a little trip!

20:13.296 --> 20:16.256
If I die in the fire zone!

20:16.382 --> 20:18.884
If I die in the fire zone!

20:19.010 --> 20:19.843
Go get!

20:19.969 --> 20:21.511
All week!

20:21.637 --> 20:22.846
Motivated!

20:22.972 --> 20:24.347
Dedicated!

20:24.473 --> 20:25.557
All day!

20:25.683 --> 20:27.017
Every day!

20:27.143 --> 20:28.852
It's in my blood!

20:28.978 --> 20:30.353
It's in my veins!

20:30.479 --> 20:31.980
Motivated!

20:32.106 --> 20:33.773
Company, halt!

20:33.900 --> 20:35.275
Fall out.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.448
You enjoying the warm-up, candidate?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.366
Bring it, Severide.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.493
I think you mean Instructor Severide.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.331
OK, everybody in my class,
meet at the aerial.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.376
That's Lieutenant Severide?

20:54.420 --> 20:57.547
Yeah. Let me guess,
he's uglier than you imagined.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.052
Jones, you're up!

21:04.347 --> 21:06.014
Dawson, go!

21:07.934 --> 21:08.934
Paul, go!

21:09.060 --> 21:12.020
Thurber. You good? Keep moving.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.107
I can't move.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.778
It's OK. It's OK. I got you.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.030
But you gotta
pull yourself up and finish.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.866
Is he OK?

21:28.746 --> 21:30.580
Thurber. Hey...

21:31.666 --> 21:32.707
Listen to me.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.002
It's OK to be afraid.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.630
Anyone with any sense is afraid to
run into a burning building.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.675
What we're doing here is training you
to do the thing that scares you.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.219
It's against human nature.
But it saves lives.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.512
So move your ass.

21:45.638 --> 21:49.015
Three-point contact.
Keep your eyes forward.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.393
Slide your hands up the rails. Let's go.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.614
Nice work up there, Jones.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.325
Thanks. I almost got knocked off there.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.285
Just accept the compliment.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.830
If I want an assessment of
how the drill went, I'll ask.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.540
Yes, sir.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.501
Hey, sweetheart.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.253
Lisa, we need to talk.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.340
I got those pizzas you like.
You want me to warm one up?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.303
I need to know what really
happened with Hayes.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.433
Jeff...

23:14.685 --> 23:16.978
...I thought we agreed
not to talk about it any more.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.022
Those were your words.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.024
Were you still in love with him?

23:21.150 --> 23:24.444
I told you, he wouldn't leave me alone.

23:24.570 --> 23:28.490
- Were you still in love with him?
- No! Of course not.

23:30.034 --> 23:33.286
So you weren't jealous
that he started seeing someone new?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.081
No.

23:43.756 --> 23:44.964
OK.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.467
I had some serious rocks
in my stomach.

23:47.593 --> 23:51.012
But then I remembered what Antonio used
to say when he was in Golden Gloves.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.515
Once you get hit the first time,
all your nerves go away.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.559
And that's basically
what happened at the first drill.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.229
Any other women in your class?

24:00.147 --> 24:01.940
One. She's good.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.068
She might consider rolling her tongue
back in her mouth over Severide.

24:05.194 --> 24:08.071
But I'm really glad she's there. She's
bringing out my competitive spirit.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.074
I am so gonna school her ass.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.826
That's my girl.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.121
Why don't you move in with me?

24:20.626 --> 24:22.794
I... I'd love that,

24:22.920 --> 24:25.338
but I feel like this place has
too many memories for you.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.799
Then let's find a new place together.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.300
You'd do that?

24:29.426 --> 24:30.802
I'd do it tomorrow.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.014
Really?

24:51.448 --> 24:53.491
You'd tell me if something was wrong,
right?

24:55.286 --> 24:56.494
Of course.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.006
You happen to see Ellen yesterday?

25:08.132 --> 25:09.674
Dang, I missed it.

25:09.800 --> 25:13.094
Oh, it was a great episode.
They had the cast of Glee on.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.139
Wow, you must have crapped a rainbow.

25:16.265 --> 25:20.018
Yeah, it, er, made me
at least five per cent gayer.

25:28.319 --> 25:31.821
Hey, I got my buddy's dry dock space.
Three weeks.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.574
Awesome, thanks.
Herrmann and Boden are in.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.870
Hey, Mills!
Wanted to talk to you real quick.

25:38.996 --> 25:42.123
Oh, er, look, Dawson
already told me, Lieutenant.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.875
Congratulations.

25:44.001 --> 25:47.962
I was gonna talk about the relief
Lieutenant's report from when I was out.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.174
Oh. Er, yeah. OK.

25:51.300 --> 25:55.595
Yeah, I just read through them all
and... Yeah, nothing but praise for you.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.972
Thanks for stepping up.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.375
Alright!

26:25.501 --> 26:27.418
Welcome to 51.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.630
For those of you who have never been to
a working firehouse, here it is.

26:30.756 --> 26:34.884
Have a look around, stay together
as a group and don't get in the way.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.177
Fall out.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.805
Come on in.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.223
Kelly.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.516
Who?

26:42.518 --> 26:45.270
- Instructor Severide.
- What can I do for you, candidate?

26:45.396 --> 26:47.063
Erm, I got a text.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.857
Herrmann and Otis are dealing with
some bank stuff regarding the bar.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.693
- Can I duck in real quick?
- Nope.

26:54.989 --> 26:59.826
As you can see, we have
a legal and binding signed contract

26:59.952 --> 27:01.452
from Mr Stephanides.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.330
It's a valid document.
I followed all the instructions.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.999
We can work with this.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.792
The problem is,

27:07.918 --> 27:12.213
Mr Stephanides didn't have ownership
standing to transfer the property

27:12.339 --> 27:14.924
because the bank held a lien on the bar.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.885
Meaning...

27:18.971 --> 27:21.097
The bank owns Molly's.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.079
This is a receipt
from the diner I was eating at

27:45.205 --> 27:46.873
when Brian Hayes was killed.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.836
The waitress is named Tonya.
She'll vouch.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.929
I had to try and protect Lisa.

28:03.057 --> 28:05.933
I'd have never made it back from Iraq
if I didn't have her to come home to.

28:09.563 --> 28:10.813
I get it, Clarke.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.482
I do.

28:15.778 --> 28:16.778
Alright.

28:16.904 --> 28:20.114
That is very welcome news.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.241
He's on shift right now.
I'm gonna go tell him.

28:22.368 --> 28:26.245
Yeah. He has been waiting
a long time to hear this.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.540
Yeah, but the place
is all dusty and old now.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.875
It used to be good back in the day.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.294
OK, everybody,
I have an announcement to make...

28:36.173 --> 28:40.134
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61...

28:40.260 --> 28:42.970
Alright, candidates, in the van now!

28:43.097 --> 28:44.680
Let's go, in the van!

28:47.976 --> 28:50.103
- Can I ride in the Squad?
- Huh?

28:52.189 --> 28:53.523
Yeah.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.369
So, Jones, what did you think
of the firehouse? You ever been in one?

29:06.495 --> 29:08.287
I have. Many times.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.039
Good.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.041
May I speak freely?

29:13.919 --> 29:15.628
Yeah, shoot. Go for it.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.132
I don't feel safe
with Thurber in our group.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.051
I mean, he's a nice guy
and he means well, but...

29:23.429 --> 29:25.680
I'm more than ready to
put my life on the line for this job,

29:25.806 --> 29:27.974
and it's kind of tough when you're
second-guessing a guy

29:28.100 --> 29:29.725
who's supposed to have your back.

29:29.852 --> 29:32.103
And I know other people in the group
feel the same.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.689
So you're speaking for the group?

29:34.815 --> 29:37.024
No, I'm speaking for myself, sir.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.254
Fire Department!

30:00.174 --> 30:02.550
You got here fast.
I tried to call it off.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.845
It's a false alarm. We have guys
working on the electrical system.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.722
Ma'am, we're gonna need to
have a look around.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.682
Oh, are you sure?

30:19.109 --> 30:20.651
They just need to have a quick look.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.570
Hey, guys.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.454
Mouch.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.005
The fire's in the wall.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.560
Alright,
everybody get down on the ground.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.814
You too, fireman,
on the floor, face down!

31:00.734 --> 31:02.735
Just let them take what they want!

31:13.997 --> 31:15.581
Cut that thing open, damn it! Hurry!

31:15.707 --> 31:17.875
Guys, you don't have time to
open that safe.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.628
This smoke is going to overwhelm us
in a matter of seconds.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.171
- We need to get out of here.
- Shut up!

31:22.297 --> 31:24.423
And tell your crew outside,
they try to come in here,

31:24.550 --> 31:26.259
this chick's dead.

31:29.179 --> 31:33.266
All companies,
we have a fire but do not attempt entry.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.017
We have a hostage situation in here.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.729
OK, Otis,
get these recruits out of my way.

31:38.855 --> 31:42.149
Mills, get on the radio.
Get the PD down here now.

31:42.276 --> 31:46.070
Engine, get me two attack lines.
Squad, stand by for a primary search.

31:46.196 --> 31:48.823
Cruz, let's get the aerial up. Let's go!

31:50.450 --> 31:52.994
You got about three minutes
until this entire place

31:53.120 --> 31:54.579
is engulfed and you're all dead!

31:56.206 --> 31:58.916
Yo! Let's get out of here!

32:05.465 --> 32:07.008
- Where you going?
- It's all yours!

32:07.134 --> 32:09.385
Hey! Hey!

32:14.308 --> 32:16.183
Alright, everybody up! Stay low!

32:16.310 --> 32:18.436
Exit through the front, dingle file!

32:18.562 --> 32:20.563
They're leaving without you, buddy!

32:21.898 --> 32:23.316
They're coming. Alright, go on!

32:23.442 --> 32:24.900
Go on, walk down. Follow the next.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.235
Keep your head down!

32:28.864 --> 32:30.072
Let's go! Move it!

32:31.074 --> 32:32.491
You alright?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.082
Back off!

32:40.208 --> 32:41.834
- Let her go!
- Lieutenant...

32:41.960 --> 32:43.210
I'm not messing around here!

32:43.337 --> 32:44.837
You think I am?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.589
Let her go!

32:47.716 --> 32:49.091
Go! Go, go, go!

32:54.723 --> 32:56.307
Lieutenant!

33:01.021 --> 33:03.230
Casey! Casey!

33:03.357 --> 33:05.232
It's me!

33:08.195 --> 33:10.196
Get her out of here!

33:23.085 --> 33:25.878
- All clear!
- Got it.

33:49.653 --> 33:50.778
Jones.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.783
I've been thinking about what you said,
and you're right.

33:55.909 --> 33:59.161
First and foremost, you need to
trust your brother or sister on the job.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.164
You're out of the Academy.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.251
I'm notifying Chief Tiberg.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.253
Take care of yourself.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.272
Does that look like a lawyer to you?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.607
Well, he ain't a plumber.

34:30.110 --> 34:33.487
This guy's looking for me and I just
can't deal with it right now, OK?

34:33.613 --> 34:34.947
Can you...

34:36.742 --> 34:39.785
Never mind. That would involve you
doing a lesbian a favour,

34:39.911 --> 34:42.496
and that's, like, one step removed
from French-kissing. I get it.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.297
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Leslie Shay?

34:52.799 --> 34:54.300
Er, she went home early.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.677
Yeah, her dog got the runs,
or some kind of deal

34:56.803 --> 34:58.596
and Shay just fell to pieces.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.684
Please tell her I stopped by.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.818
- I could kiss you right now.
- Fair warning.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.905
If you want to break balls with me,
you better be damn sure

35:16.031 --> 35:17.323
cos I wrote the book.

35:17.449 --> 35:21.160
You wrote a book, which is
two pages long and self-published.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.745
Mine is like this.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.456
- It's on.
- Oh, it's on.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.124
Yeah, it's on.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.216
Casey.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.385
I just heard about the call.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.639
How that hostage situation went down.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.643
Er...

35:45.769 --> 35:47.269
Damn fine work.

35:49.564 --> 35:50.898
Thanks, Chief.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.818
Now, if I can finally make
that announcement.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.111
The city has approved an additional spot
on Squad 3.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.073
And that spot will be filled by...

36:00.075 --> 36:01.534
...Peter Mills.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.790
That is, of course,
if you still want it.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.751
Er, yeah! Yeah, I want it. Erm...

36:11.628 --> 36:13.420
I just... I don't understand. Why now?

36:13.547 --> 36:15.381
You have Lieutenant Casey to thank.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.175
He pushed for you on this.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.469
He wrote a great commendation.

36:24.766 --> 36:25.850
Alright.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.106
Chief, she's not ready.

36:32.232 --> 36:35.901
First day and she's already
throwing another recruit under the bus.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.738
Her father is
Deputy District Chief Lionel Jones.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.867
Perhaps you can sympathise, Kelly.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.536
Son of
Captain Benjamin Severide?

36:47.372 --> 36:48.831
I don't care whose kid she is.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.249
I do.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.460
Make it work.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.589
Thank you.

37:03.346 --> 37:07.266
I will trade you two sheep for one ore.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.018
Hmm.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.561
OK...

37:11.897 --> 37:13.230
Sucker.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.900
Oh! Oh, am I?

37:16.026 --> 37:20.112
Well, this sucker is about to build
a new settlement.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.074
Hmm, I would check
the Building Costs card if I were you

37:24.200 --> 37:27.578
because I believe you need brick
to build a settlement, not ore.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.330
What?

37:29.456 --> 37:31.540
- Oh, nuts. I...
- Mmm.

37:31.666 --> 37:37.504
Can you let it slide just this
one time... because I'm cute?

37:39.215 --> 37:41.592
Well, you are pretty cute.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.223
Are you gonna kiss me?

37:48.350 --> 37:50.601
Do you want me to?

37:50.727 --> 37:52.853
Only if you want to.

37:53.897 --> 37:54.897
Do you want to?

37:55.023 --> 37:56.398
Yes.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.991
- Hey, Kelly.
- Hello.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.911
CFD is in great hands, guys,

38:09.037 --> 38:11.163
absolutely nothing to worry about.

38:12.415 --> 38:13.832
Did you guys drink all the beer?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.422
Alright, well, I'm heading to Molly's.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.717
I'm gonna buy Mills a drink for making
Squad if either of you want to come.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.553
Oh, erm, actually,
I have to go do this thing,

38:26.680 --> 38:28.389
er, down in Wicker Park.

38:28.515 --> 38:29.765
Are you... Are you good to drive?

38:29.891 --> 38:32.935
Because I'm actually, I think I'm
gonna head in that general direction,

38:33.061 --> 38:34.561
so I could take you...

38:34.688 --> 38:36.271
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great if...

38:36.398 --> 38:38.524
- Yeah, if you don't... If...
- No, not at all. Let's go.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.817
OK.

38:43.780 --> 38:47.199
- See ya!
- Hey, yeah. Have fun.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.993
- See ya.
- Hey.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.001
Drive safe.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.674
To Peter Mills!

39:03.800 --> 39:07.553
A real smoke-eater, even though
he couldn't hack it on Truck.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.929
Thank you, Herrmann. Thank you.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.681
You know,
I can't believe I'm saying this,

39:10.807 --> 39:14.727
but it looks like that blood-sucker at
the bank is gonna screw me on the bar.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.396
There's not gonna be too many more
nights like this at Molly's,

39:17.522 --> 39:21.567
so in light of that, my brothers,
ten per cent off all the drinks tonight!

39:21.693 --> 39:23.027
Er, OK.

39:23.153 --> 39:25.863
Anyway, congrats, Mills.

39:27.073 --> 39:31.076
A firefighter brother recently asked me
what makes a good squad guy.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.704
He said, "Hey,
Randy McHolland, what makes a..."

39:33.830 --> 39:35.581
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.500
Mouch, why do you keep referring to
yourself in the third person?

39:39.919 --> 39:44.339
OK, look, I'm trying to subtly
reinforce my real name,

39:44.466 --> 39:46.008
so you guys will start calling me that.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.886
Cos now that I'm interim president,
I don't think a nickname

39:49.012 --> 39:51.889
that means half-man, half-couch
is appropriate anymore.

39:52.015 --> 39:55.893
Well, then why don't you just say,
"Hey, guys, quit calling me Mouch"?

39:57.270 --> 39:59.063
You're right. I should've.

39:59.189 --> 40:02.107
So, can you quit calling me Mouch?

40:03.151 --> 40:05.194
No. Mills, make a speech.

40:06.654 --> 40:10.157
I just want to say
thank you guys for your help

40:10.283 --> 40:13.786
and support and, Lieutenant,
I'll come through for you.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.746
- I know you will.
- Cheers!

40:15.872 --> 40:18.248
Salut!

40:21.002 --> 40:22.836
Gonna miss you, baby.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.048
Ah! That's good.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.008
Forget about what I said
about the discounts...

40:28.134 --> 40:29.259
Give me another beer.

40:31.846 --> 40:34.389
- We heard.
- Yeah.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.434
Look, I know that wasn't easy, so...

40:40.814 --> 40:42.106
You want to get drunk?

40:43.191 --> 40:45.484
Yeah, I need to be with some family.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.361
Come on, brother.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.072
Hey, look who made it!

40:50.198 --> 40:52.866
- Hey!
- How you doing, ugly?

40:52.992 --> 40:55.661
Hey, brother, there you go.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.457
- Visiting hours ended.
- I just need five minutes.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.751
- OK.
- Thank you.

41:02.877 --> 41:03.961
- Five.
- Alright.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.048
Hey, Jeremy.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.300
Forgot your name.

41:10.426 --> 41:11.885
Matt.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.515
- Do you remember the bet we made?
- I do.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.980
You, er, got family in town?

41:23.106 --> 41:26.692
No. My sister, she's gonna
be here tomorrow from Scottsdale.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.613
Is this gonna mix with
the painkillers I'm on?

41:32.991 --> 41:34.324
Can't hurt.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.122
I'm so glad to be alive.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.920
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
