00:17.199 --> 00:19.500
Male narrator:
Terror at the temple!

00:19.502 --> 00:21.602
The jedi temple
is in disarray

00:21.604 --> 00:22.770
After a vicious
terrorist attack.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.339
Anakin skywalker
and ahsoka tano

00:25.341 --> 00:26.574
Set out to find the truth

00:26.576 --> 00:29.443
Of who was really behind
this horrendous catastrophe.

00:29.445 --> 00:34.248
Their investigation led them
to discover the true saboteur,

00:34.250 --> 00:34.749
Letta turmond.

00:34.751 --> 00:38.352
Now the jedi attempt to return
the temple to normalcy.

00:38.354 --> 00:41.422
But first master yoda
must give a eulogy

00:41.424 --> 00:44.859
To the fallen jedi warriors.

00:45.394 --> 00:46.761
- One with the force,
they are.

00:46.763 --> 00:51.299
And our job it is
to remember that we will,

00:51.301 --> 00:53.668
In time,
also pass on.

00:53.670 --> 00:55.303
Luminous beings are we,

00:55.305 --> 00:57.638
But temporary vessels,
our bodies are.

00:57.640 --> 01:02.577
And we shall all find ourselves
here in time.

01:02.579 --> 01:04.611
A moment of silence, I ask,

01:04.614 --> 01:09.383
To remember and to move on.

01:10.552 --> 01:13.654
- You were close
to one of them?

01:13.656 --> 01:15.389
- Tutso mara.

01:15.391 --> 01:17.458
We trained together.

01:17.460 --> 01:21.195
He taught me how to hold
my lightsaber correctly.

01:21.197 --> 01:25.466
- Live for the living jedi,
we must.

01:25.468 --> 01:30.371
Live through us,
forever they will.

01:50.559 --> 01:52.326
- So what happens
to letta now?

01:52.328 --> 01:54.695
- The bomber has been moved.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.796
- Moved?

01:55.798 --> 01:56.597
Where?

01:56.599 --> 01:57.732
Why should she be moved?

01:57.734 --> 02:01.602
- The republic military
has taken her into custody.

02:01.604 --> 02:02.603
- But why?

02:02.605 --> 02:04.372
This is a jedi matter,
isn't it?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.207
- Clones were killed,

02:06.209 --> 02:07.441
Which makes
this terrorist attack

02:07.443 --> 02:09.243
A military matter.

02:09.245 --> 02:13.247
An attack on the jedi
is an attack on the senate.

02:13.249 --> 02:14.382
- Admiral tarkin is right.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.517
Letta isn't a jedi.

02:16.519 --> 02:18.452
It's not for us
to be judge and jury

02:18.454 --> 02:19.453
Over a citizen
of the republic.

02:19.455 --> 02:22.490
- If letta's guilty,
she's guilty,

02:22.492 --> 02:24.625
And she should be dealt with.

02:24.627 --> 02:25.393
- Calm down, ahsoka.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.630
Remember,
revenge is not the jedi way.

02:29.632 --> 02:33.634
- The evidence seems clear,
ahsoka.

02:33.636 --> 02:35.670
Nothing will ever change.

02:35.672 --> 02:38.272
- The chancellor
feels very strongly

02:38.274 --> 02:38.906
That the jedi be removed

02:38.908 --> 02:42.343
From as many military matters
as possible.

02:42.345 --> 02:46.447
You yourselves
said that you're peacekeepers,

02:46.449 --> 02:47.281
Not soldiers.

02:47.283 --> 02:50.384
- I hope chancellor palpatine
knows what he's doing.

02:50.386 --> 02:53.354
- I assure you
that he rarely does anything

02:53.356 --> 02:54.822
Without a strategy.

02:54.824 --> 02:56.357
[elevator beeps]

02:59.628 --> 03:04.332
- I have many things
to attend to, masters.

03:04.334 --> 03:05.733
Good day.

03:05.735 --> 03:06.834
Ahsoka.

03:10.572 --> 03:11.339
- Go.

03:11.341 --> 03:14.342
Be with your friend, ahsoka.

03:15.610 --> 03:16.243
[sighs]

03:16.245 --> 03:18.546
In ways,
she is still very young.

03:18.548 --> 03:21.515
- Indeed.

03:25.687 --> 03:26.821
- Company?

03:26.823 --> 03:27.421
- Sure.

03:27.423 --> 03:31.158
- Every time I think about this,
I feel conflicted.

03:31.160 --> 03:36.364
It's hard not to let feelings
turn into attachment and pain.

03:36.366 --> 03:37.631
- Ahsoka,
have you ever wondered

03:37.633 --> 03:41.369
If it was right
to ignore your emotions?

03:41.371 --> 03:42.203
- My master would say,

03:42.205 --> 03:45.306
"our struggle as jedi
is to move past them."

03:45.308 --> 03:48.275
- You make it sound so easy.

03:48.277 --> 03:48.843
- [chuckles]

03:48.845 --> 03:50.644
No, it isn't easy.

03:50.646 --> 03:51.812
But it's possible.

03:51.814 --> 03:52.680
Like, when we were stuck

03:52.682 --> 03:54.682
Inside the battle tank
on geonosis,

03:54.684 --> 03:56.784
It was hard not to be afraid.

03:56.786 --> 03:57.818
Still,
you and I got past it.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.921
And I guess
we'll get past this.

04:00.923 --> 04:04.658
- You've always been capable
of seeing things clearly.

04:04.660 --> 04:05.326
- [chuckles]

04:05.328 --> 04:08.295
I guess I've fooled you
like I have everyone else.

04:08.297 --> 04:09.463
[comlink beeping]

04:09.465 --> 04:10.364
Yes, master.

04:10.366 --> 04:11.866
- Ahsoka, we're needed
in the war room.

04:11.868 --> 04:14.435
It appears the separatists
have mounted another attack.

04:14.437 --> 04:17.271
- Coming, master.

04:17.273 --> 04:20.541
Look, I have to believe
that one way or another,

04:20.543 --> 04:22.643
This woman's going to pay
for what she did.

04:22.645 --> 04:28.416
- You shouldn't
keep your master waiting.

04:33.688 --> 04:37.491
- We've uncovered
a separatist plan of attack.

04:37.493 --> 04:40.161
We shall travel
to the anoat system here,

04:40.163 --> 04:42.430
Then move across
to saleucami.

04:42.432 --> 04:44.432
- So far out of our way?

04:44.434 --> 04:48.669
- Unfortunately, we must avoid
these neutral systems.

04:48.671 --> 04:50.538
- Excuse me, master jedi.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.705
- Yes, admiral.

04:51.707 --> 04:52.406
- Commander tano,

04:52.408 --> 04:55.576
Your presence is requested
by prisoner letta turmond.

04:55.578 --> 04:57.311
- The prisoner
from the hangar bombing?

04:57.313 --> 04:59.580
- Why is she asking
for ahsoka?

04:59.582 --> 05:00.414
- Not exactly sure.

05:00.416 --> 05:02.516
But commander tano
is the only person

05:02.518 --> 05:03.884
The prisoner will speak to.

05:03.886 --> 05:08.522
- I'll report back
with whatever I find out.

05:23.305 --> 05:25.840
[engines whooshing]

05:49.297 --> 05:49.663
- Yes?

05:49.665 --> 05:50.498
- I'm commander tano.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.533
Letta turmond
requested to see me.

05:52.535 --> 05:55.769
- A lot of innocent people
died in that blast.

05:55.771 --> 05:58.372
Good job capturing her.

05:59.341 --> 06:00.908
All right, scan her.

06:03.345 --> 06:05.546
[scanner pinging]

06:05.548 --> 06:10.217
Leave your comlink
and lightsabers here.

06:16.157 --> 06:18.259
Follow me.

06:41.716 --> 06:43.317
- What do you want, letta?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.719
- I was told
if I ever needed help,

06:45.721 --> 06:48.422
You were the jedi
to contact.

06:51.259 --> 06:53.928
- Give us a minute, please.

06:57.499 --> 06:58.699
You don't have much time,
letta,

06:58.701 --> 07:02.136
So I suggest you get
whatever you have to say

07:02.138 --> 07:04.305
Off your chest.

07:04.372 --> 07:08.509
- The idea of feeding jackar
the nano-droids was not mine.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.611
- Why are you saying this now?

07:10.613 --> 07:12.179
Why didn't you
reveal this before?

07:12.181 --> 07:14.615
- Because my life is in danger.

07:14.617 --> 07:17.318
The person behind this
will be able to get to me

07:17.320 --> 07:19.420
Unless you know the truth.

07:19.422 --> 07:22.356
- Huh.
What's the truth?

07:22.358 --> 07:22.756
- A jedi.

07:22.758 --> 07:25.159
A jedi showed me
how to create the bomb

07:25.161 --> 07:27.394
And how to put
the nano-droids in.

07:27.396 --> 07:28.329
- Why would a jedi do this?

07:28.331 --> 07:31.365
- There are some citizens
of the republic, like myself,

07:31.367 --> 07:35.469
Who believe the jedi order
is not what it used to be.

07:35.471 --> 07:37.605
The jedi
have become warmongers.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.707
They've become
military weapons.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.507
And they're killing

07:40.509 --> 07:41.742
When they should be
keeping the peace.

07:41.744 --> 07:45.145
One of these jedi
agreed with us.

07:45.147 --> 07:47.414
One of you
wanted to make a statement

07:47.416 --> 07:51.619
And was willing to attack
your own order to do it.

07:52.754 --> 07:53.487
- Who?

07:53.489 --> 07:55.456
- If you protect me,
I will tell you,

07:55.458 --> 07:58.559
Because it is obvious to me
that I have been set up.

07:58.561 --> 08:03.597
- Letta, you have to tell me
who is behind this.

08:06.635 --> 08:08.335
- It's--

08:08.337 --> 08:09.370
- Letta!

08:09.372 --> 08:10.404
Letta!

08:10.406 --> 08:10.871
Letta!

08:10.873 --> 08:12.373
- Prisoner health critical,

08:12.375 --> 08:15.476
Holding cell 173.

08:15.478 --> 08:18.479
- Commander fox,
the prisoner.

08:18.481 --> 08:20.581
- Follow me.

08:22.317 --> 08:23.717
- [choking]

08:23.719 --> 08:25.352
- Letta!

08:31.459 --> 08:34.495
I...
Don't know what happened.

08:34.496 --> 08:36.397
- Commander, she's dead.

08:36.399 --> 08:39.366
- I can't say I blame you,
commander tano.

08:39.368 --> 08:42.703
But all the same,
you're under arrest.

08:42.705 --> 08:45.172
- I...
No, no.

08:45.174 --> 08:47.675
I did not do this.

09:14.135 --> 09:17.271
- Admiral tarkin,
I don't know what happened.

09:17.273 --> 09:19.106
I went in the room
to talk to letta,

09:19.108 --> 09:22.543
And she said
she was afraid of a jedi.

09:23.278 --> 09:28.615
- You don't have to tell me
any more, commander tano.

09:28.617 --> 09:29.316
- I don't?

09:29.318 --> 09:29.683
- No.

09:29.685 --> 09:33.153
There are recorders
in every room.

09:33.155 --> 09:38.492
Curiously, the sound
isn't working on this one.

09:39.494 --> 09:43.564
It seems the jedi
she was afraid of was you.

09:43.566 --> 09:46.233
- I did not kill that woman.

09:46.235 --> 09:47.234
- You were the only one there.

09:47.236 --> 09:48.435
I know that you were upset
when this woman

09:48.437 --> 09:50.671
Was taken into custody
by the military.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.774
- That means nothing.

09:53.776 --> 09:54.742
- I beg to differ.

09:54.744 --> 09:56.577
- It was someone else,
admiral,

09:56.579 --> 09:58.378
Someone I didn't see.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.514
- You know
that is very difficult

10:00.516 --> 10:02.249
For me to believe.

10:02.251 --> 10:03.650
This is a secure facility.

10:03.652 --> 10:07.387
We do not have
just anyone running about.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.623
And if there was someone else,

10:09.625 --> 10:12.526
Why did you not sense them?

10:21.236 --> 10:24.671
- I said
my padawan is in there.

10:24.673 --> 10:25.773
Now, step aside.

10:25.775 --> 10:26.573
- General skywalker,

10:26.575 --> 10:31.612
Admiral tarkin has ordered
that no one be allowed in there.

10:31.614 --> 10:34.515
- I don't care
what she's accused of.

10:34.517 --> 10:37.451
Let me in.

10:39.854 --> 10:41.855
- Sorry, sir.

10:41.857 --> 10:44.324
The admiral's orders stand.

10:44.326 --> 10:45.592
This is now
a military operation

10:45.594 --> 10:49.797
And under his jurisdiction.

11:06.714 --> 11:08.615
- [coughs]

11:17.225 --> 11:18.325
A key card.

11:18.327 --> 11:21.662
Master, I knew
you wouldn't let me down.

11:32.707 --> 11:36.944
I wonder
what you have planned.

11:46.721 --> 11:47.721
Oh, no.

11:47.723 --> 11:50.557
This does not look good.

11:57.899 --> 11:59.800
My lightsabers.

11:59.802 --> 12:03.837
[comlink beeping]

12:03.839 --> 12:05.439
Hello?

12:05.441 --> 12:05.906
Who is this?

12:05.908 --> 12:09.343
Why are you helping me?

12:10.578 --> 12:11.745
- What's going on here?

12:11.747 --> 12:13.714
- It wasn't me.

12:13.716 --> 12:16.717
[alarm blaring]

12:16.719 --> 12:17.517
- Alert!
Alert!

12:17.519 --> 12:21.488
The jedi prisoner
has escaped.

12:24.259 --> 12:28.362
[droid speaking alien language]

12:38.339 --> 12:39.539
- Commander tano, stop!

12:42.310 --> 12:44.845
She's heading north
in the prison corridor.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.281
Cut her off!

12:47.283 --> 12:48.882
- Copy that.

13:09.337 --> 13:11.371
- Oh, no.

13:12.607 --> 13:14.875
[blaster firing]

13:16.311 --> 13:19.479
- The suspect
has killed three clones.

13:19.481 --> 13:19.880
Code red.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.516
If you see the target,
shoot to kill.

13:22.518 --> 13:24.551
- Belay that order,
commander fox.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.553
- She's killed troopers.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.454
- I know commander tano.

13:27.456 --> 13:29.790
She would never
do something like this.

13:29.792 --> 13:32.392
- Then who did?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.428
- Quiet!

13:34.430 --> 13:35.529
Ahsoka!

13:35.531 --> 13:37.864
It's me, anakin.

13:40.368 --> 13:42.869
Stop running.

13:43.304 --> 13:45.205
- You can't help me, master.

13:45.207 --> 13:46.707
Someone's setting me up.

13:46.709 --> 13:49.710
- I believe you, ahsoka.

13:49.712 --> 13:52.646
- But no one else will.

13:55.283 --> 13:57.584
- Keep searching
until we find her.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.352
Rex, call security.

13:58.354 --> 14:01.254
Tell them we need
to search the entire base.

14:01.256 --> 14:01.755
Now!

14:01.757 --> 14:02.456
[comlink beeps]

14:02.458 --> 14:03.657
- General skywalker
has just issued

14:03.659 --> 14:07.294
An all-points bulletin
on commander ahsoka tano.

14:07.296 --> 14:08.128
She's killed three clones

14:08.130 --> 14:12.666
And should be considered
armed and dangerous.

14:24.645 --> 14:26.680
- The prisoner was just spotted
in the east wing,

14:26.682 --> 14:29.583
Cell block 1218-11.

15:13.394 --> 15:15.328

come on, grizzer.

15:15.330 --> 15:16.563
There's nothing here.

15:24.272 --> 15:24.805
- There she is!

15:24.807 --> 15:28.341
Quick, stop her
before she gets to the ship!

15:59.240 --> 16:02.109
- All right, don't lose her.
We'll be right there.

16:02.111 --> 16:03.176
- What's going on?

16:03.178 --> 16:03.743
- We've found her.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.545
She's heading towards
the industrial pipeline.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.547
- Set weapons to stun.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.482
I want her alive!

16:18.292 --> 16:20.727
[blaster firing]

16:53.528 --> 16:54.828
Do not shoot to kill.

16:54.830 --> 16:57.264
Do not shoot to kill!

16:57.266 --> 16:58.198
Try to box her in.

16:58.200 --> 16:58.798
Don't let her escape.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.668
Tell me what you see,
oddball.

17:13.146 --> 17:16.583
- She's moving west
along the central viaduct.

17:30.665 --> 17:32.465
All right,
we got her now.

17:44.412 --> 17:48.181
- This will knock her
off her feet.

17:48.183 --> 17:50.383
[blaster booms]

18:05.533 --> 18:08.602
- Not so fast,
commander.

18:13.708 --> 18:17.444
[creatures growling]

18:30.625 --> 18:32.392
- Ahsoka!

19:21.208 --> 19:22.709
[creature squawks]

20:06.520 --> 20:09.322
Ahsoka,
what are you doing?

20:09.324 --> 20:12.692
- You didn't even try
to come and help me.

20:12.694 --> 20:14.661
- They wouldn't let me in
to talk to you.

20:14.663 --> 20:16.663
- You could have
if you tried.

20:16.665 --> 20:19.666
- How would that look,
ahsoka, huh?

20:19.668 --> 20:20.367
Forcing my way in

20:20.369 --> 20:22.535
Would've made you look
even more guilty.

20:22.537 --> 20:23.269
- I'm not guilty!

20:23.271 --> 20:26.339
- Then we have to prove
you're innocent.

20:26.341 --> 20:28.441
The only way we can do that
is by going back.

20:28.443 --> 20:30.176
- I don't know
who to trust.

20:30.178 --> 20:35.382
- Listen, I would never
let anyone hurt you, ahsoka,

20:35.384 --> 20:36.216
Never.

20:36.218 --> 20:37.417
But you need to come back

20:37.419 --> 20:39.285
And make your case
to the council.

20:39.287 --> 20:40.320
- No.

20:40.322 --> 20:44.657
I'm not going to take the fall
for something I didn't do!

20:44.659 --> 20:47.560
- I am ordering you
to put down your lightsaber

20:47.562 --> 20:50.430
And come with me now!

20:50.432 --> 20:50.830
Trust me.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.832
- General skywalker,
where are you?

20:52.834 --> 20:54.834
- I do trust you.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.237
But you know
as well as I do

20:57.239 --> 20:59.639
That no one else
will believe me.

21:02.410 --> 21:06.746
Anakin,
you have to trust me now.

21:06.748 --> 21:08.615
- Ahsoka,
I do trust you.

21:08.617 --> 21:10.784
- I know you do.

21:11.218 --> 21:14.454
Wish me luck.
