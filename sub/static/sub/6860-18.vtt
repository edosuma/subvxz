Their investigation led them
to discover the true saboteur,

Letta turmond.

00:34.751 --> 00:38.352
Now the jedi attempt to return
the temple to normalcy.

must give a eulogy

this terrorist attack

02:07.443 --> 02:09.243
A military matter.

03:37.633 --> 03:41.369
If it was right
to ignore your emotions?

"our struggle as jedi
is to move past them."

But commander tano
is the only person

05:02.518 --> 05:03.884

What's the truth?

07:22.358 --> 07:22.756

07:22.758 --> 07:25.159
A jedi showed me
how to create the bomb

07:25.161 --> 07:27.394
And how to put
the nano-droids in.

07:27.396 --> 07:28.329
- Why would a jedi do this?

07:28.331 --> 07:31.365
- There are some citizens
of the republic, like myself,

07:31.367 --> 07:35.469
Who believe the jedi order
is not what it used to be.

07:35.471 --> 07:37.605
The jedi
have become warmongers.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.707
They've become

One of these jedi

07:53.489 --> 07:55.456

I will tell you,

07:55.458 --> 07:58.559
Because it is obvious to me
that I have been set up.

07:58.561 --> 08:03.597
- Letta, you have to tell me
who is behind this.

No, no.

09:17.273 --> 09:19.106
I went in the room

09:19.108 --> 09:22.543
And she said
she was afraid of a jedi.

09:23.278 --> 09:28.615

09:28.617 --> 09:29.316

There are recorders

Curiously, the sound

It seems the jedi

has just issued

14:03.659 --> 14:07.294
An all-points bulletin
on commander ahsoka tano.

14:07.296 --> 14:08.128
She's killed three clones

14:08.130 --> 14:12.666
And should be considered
armed and dangerous.

14:24.645 --> 14:26.680
- The prisoner was just spotted
in the east wing,

15:15.330 --> 15:16.563
There's nothing here.

15:24.272 --> 15:24.805
- There she is!

We'll be right there.

16:02.111 --> 16:03.176
- What's going on?

16:03.178 --> 16:03.743
- We've found her.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.545
She's heading towards
the industrial pipeline.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.547

16:07.549 --> 16:08.482
I want her alive!

[blaster firing]

16:53.528 --> 16:54.828
Do not shoot to kill.

16:54.830 --> 16:57.264
Do not shoot to kill!

16:57.266 --> 16:58.198
Try to box her in.

16:58.200 --> 16:58.798
Don't let her escape.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.668
Tell me what you see,
oddball.

17:13.146 --> 17:16.583
- She's moving west
along the central viaduct.

17:30.665 --> 17:32.465
All right,
we got her now.

17:44.412 --> 17:48.181
- This will knock her
off her feet.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.322
Ahsoka,
what are you doing?

20:09.324 --> 20:12.692
- You didn't even try
to come and help me.

20:12.694 --> 20:14.661
- They wouldn't let me in
to talk to you.

20:14.663 --> 20:16.663
- You could have
if you tried.

20:16.665 --> 20:19.666
- How would that look,
ahsoka, huh?

20:19.668 --> 20:20.367
Forcing my way in

20:20.369 --> 20:22.535
Would've made you look
even more guilty.

20:22.537 --> 20:23.269
- I'm not guilty!

20:23.271 --> 20:26.339
- Then we have to prove
you're innocent.

20:26.341 --> 20:28.441
The only way we can do that
is by going back.

20:28.443 --> 20:30.176
- I don't know
who to trust.

20:30.178 --> 20:35.382
- Listen, I would never
let anyone hurt you, ahsoka,

20:35.384 --> 20:36.216
Never.

20:36.218 --> 20:37.417
But you need to come back

20:37.419 --> 20:39.285
And make your case
to the council.

20:39.287 --> 20:40.320
- No.

20:40.322 --> 20:44.657
I'm not going to take the fall
for something I didn't do!

20:44.659 --> 20:47.560
- I am ordering you
to put down your lightsaber

20:47.562 --> 20:50.430
And come with me now!

20:50.432 --> 20:50.830
Trust me.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.832
- General skywalker,
where are you?

20:52.834 --> 20:54.834
- I do trust you.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.237
But you know
as well as I do

20:57.239 --> 20:59.639
That no one else
will believe me.

21:02.410 --> 21:06.746
Anakin,
you have to trust me now.

21:06.748 --> 21:08.615
- Ahsoka,
I do trust you.

21:08.617 --> 21:10.784
- I know you do.

21:11.218 --> 21:14.454
Wish me luck.
