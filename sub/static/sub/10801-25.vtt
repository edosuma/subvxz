WEBVTT

00:02.540 --> 00:06.205
Captain's log, stardate 45944.1.

00:06.335 --> 00:10.119
Following a magnetic-wave survey
of the Parvenium system,

00:10.256 --> 00:14.170
we have detected an object which
we cannot immediately identify.

00:16.637 --> 00:18.262
Magnify it.

00:20.558 --> 00:23.808
- Mr Data?
- It appears to be a probe.

00:23.936 --> 00:26.641
But there is no record
of this design.

00:26.772 --> 00:27.887
Is it scanning us?

00:28.024 --> 00:31.973
No, but it is in a relative position
and is holding course with us.

00:32.110 --> 00:35.646
It is made of paricium and talgonite,
a ceramic alloy.

00:35.781 --> 00:38.023
Not a sophisticated technology.

00:38.159 --> 00:43.117
Sir, I detect a low-level nucleonic
beam coming from the probe.

00:43.247 --> 00:45.204
Shields up. Stand by phasers.

00:45.332 --> 00:48.666
The beam is scanning
the shield's perimeter.

00:48.794 --> 00:51.415
The probe is emitting
a particle stream.

00:51.547 --> 00:55.212
- It is penetrating our shields.
- Increase speed to...

00:55.342 --> 00:56.884
Captain!

00:57.469 --> 00:58.928
It's alright!

01:01.807 --> 01:04.263
Captain, I've got you. It's...

01:07.646 --> 01:09.140
Well, finally.

01:14.069 --> 01:15.444
How are you feeling?

01:17.281 --> 01:20.981
Kamin, can you answer me?

01:22.327 --> 01:25.827
- What is this place?
- You're still feverish.

01:26.790 --> 01:29.032
Computer, freeze program.

01:31.461 --> 01:33.370
Computer, end program!

01:34.256 --> 01:35.370
Kamin.

01:38.885 --> 01:40.463
Picard to Enterprise!

01:40.595 --> 01:43.881
Kamin, please don't get up.
You're still not well.

01:45.642 --> 01:49.225
I asked you, what is this place?

01:51.147 --> 01:54.931
This is your home, of course!

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.848 --> 02:29.099
Space, the final frontier.

02:30.561 --> 02:34.476
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:34.607 --> 02:38.936
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

02:40.196 --> 02:43.529
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

02:44.742 --> 02:48.822
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

03:58.523 --> 04:00.101
Am I a prisoner here?

04:00.984 --> 04:03.475
You've had a high fever
for three days.

04:03.612 --> 04:06.103
You mustn't push yourself
too quickly.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.666
Kamin!

04:24.841 --> 04:27.593
You really shouldn't go outside!

04:41.024 --> 04:42.981
Kamin!

04:43.109 --> 04:45.434
Please, come back inside.

05:26.736 --> 05:28.396
Thank you.

05:29.655 --> 05:34.613
This sapling is planted
as an affirmation of life,

05:34.744 --> 05:40.118
in defiance of the drought
and with expectations of long life.

05:40.624 --> 05:44.574
Whatever comes,
we will keep it alive

05:45.463 --> 05:48.084
as a symbol of our survival.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.340
Kamin! You're back on your feet.
How do you feel?

05:55.472 --> 05:56.967
Are you in charge here?

05:58.100 --> 06:01.267
- In charge?
- I want to be returned to my ship.

06:02.438 --> 06:04.098
What ship is that?

06:05.232 --> 06:06.430
Please.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.988
Just tell me, what is this place?
Where am I?

06:15.325 --> 06:18.777
The fever. It's taken your memory.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.037
That must be it.

06:24.626 --> 06:27.960
- Perhaps you can help me.
- Anything, my friend.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.795
- My name is Kamin?
- Yes.

06:30.924 --> 06:34.589
- And you are?
- Batai.

06:36.179 --> 06:37.757
Council Leader Batai.

06:40.058 --> 06:43.593
Batai. And you say I've been ill?

06:43.729 --> 06:47.857
For more than a week. Eline
should have put you in the hospital,

06:47.983 --> 06:50.355
but she insisted on caring for you.

06:50.485 --> 06:53.569
- Eline?
- Your wife.

06:55.282 --> 06:59.066
If you don't remember that,
maybe it's safer not to go home!

07:02.330 --> 07:06.458
And... what is this place?

07:08.378 --> 07:11.498
- Perhaps you should see the doctor.
- No, please.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.837
I'm sure it will all come back to me.

07:14.426 --> 07:20.345
Well, this... is the community
of Ressik. Northern Province.

07:20.473 --> 07:24.138
- What planet?
- Let me take you home.

07:24.269 --> 07:28.218
No, really, I'm quite alright.
Just answer me. What planet?

07:30.149 --> 07:33.150
This is the planet Kataan.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.688
Kataan.

07:35.571 --> 07:37.730
Not a Federation planet.

07:40.368 --> 07:44.946
I... think I'll... just take a walk.

07:45.581 --> 07:47.823
But you've been ill for a week!

07:49.168 --> 07:51.742
The exercise will do me good.

07:51.879 --> 07:57.253
I'll... try to reacquaint myself
with the surroundings.

08:40.260 --> 08:42.004
Thank goodness!

08:50.979 --> 08:55.974
I've had people out trying to find
you. Why did you worry us like that?

08:57.819 --> 08:59.646
Are you hungry?

09:00.906 --> 09:04.156
Hungry, thirsty... exhausted.

09:11.375 --> 09:15.668
I suppose that proves
this is not a dream, doesn't it?

09:16.671 --> 09:20.918
You think that this...
your life is a dream?

09:21.051 --> 09:23.090
This is not my life!

09:25.180 --> 09:26.840
I know that much.

09:30.060 --> 09:32.633
I've kept something hot for you.

09:36.983 --> 09:39.059
Where did you go?

09:40.195 --> 09:43.149
I walked. For hours.

09:44.324 --> 09:46.447
And you're just out of bed!

10:06.679 --> 10:08.387
It's delicious.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.308
You always say that.

10:13.728 --> 10:17.560
Would you answer some questions,
no matter how strange they seem?

10:17.690 --> 10:19.564
Of course.

10:21.235 --> 10:25.150
Are there other planets in this star
system? Do you visit other systems?

10:28.910 --> 10:30.618
Alright.

10:31.829 --> 10:34.450
Do you have
a communications system here?

10:34.582 --> 10:39.825
How do you send messages
to other communities, other places?

10:39.962 --> 10:43.378
The usual way.
By voice-transit conductor.

10:43.507 --> 10:47.172
- Do you want to send a message?
- Yes.

10:49.055 --> 10:52.554
- When can that be arranged?
- Tomorrow.

10:56.854 --> 11:00.852
- Don't you want to ask about us?
- Of course.

11:03.068 --> 11:05.855
Anything you can tell me
will be helpful.

11:05.988 --> 11:07.363
We...

11:08.532 --> 11:09.907
We...

11:11.493 --> 11:13.071
We're married?

11:14.872 --> 11:16.864
Three years ago.

11:17.833 --> 11:21.831
The happiest day of my life
was the day we got married.

11:26.675 --> 11:30.009
And what do I do here in Ressik?

11:30.137 --> 11:34.181
You're the best iron weaver in
the community. At least, I think so.

11:34.308 --> 11:37.558
You prefer playing the flute,
of course.

11:37.686 --> 11:40.687
- The flute?
- Yes.

11:56.163 --> 11:58.736
When did I learn to play this?

11:58.874 --> 12:01.828
I'm afraid you never did, dear,
but you keep trying.

12:07.799 --> 12:09.258
I see what you mean.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.091
Well, thank you for the soup.

12:15.265 --> 12:17.304
Thank you for your help.

12:17.434 --> 12:19.972
Tomorrow, will you help me
send a message?

12:20.103 --> 12:24.432
Of course.
Now, will you come to bed?

12:26.609 --> 12:30.192
- I'll sleep here.
- Kamin, please come with me.

12:31.781 --> 12:36.443
I've been sick. I'll be tossing and
turning. It wouldn't be fair to you.

12:37.370 --> 12:39.659
Let me be the judge of that.

12:48.256 --> 12:49.833
Where did you get this?

12:51.426 --> 12:55.008
Kamin, this is the first gift
you ever gave me.

12:58.266 --> 13:01.848
Riker to sickbay,
the Captain's hurt.

13:13.739 --> 13:16.065
Pulse and blood pressure are normal.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.486
Hyperactive fibrogenic activity.
This is odd.

13:19.620 --> 13:23.155
- What is it?
- There's no evidence of injury.

13:23.290 --> 13:25.532
Vital signs are normal.

13:25.668 --> 13:30.045
But neurotransmitter production
is off the scale. What's going on?

13:30.172 --> 13:33.541
This probe is doing something.
Anything yet, Data?

13:33.676 --> 13:39.050
No, sir. The particle emission
is unusual. I am unable to block it.

13:39.181 --> 13:41.968
We should destroy the probe.
Phasers are ready.

13:42.101 --> 13:45.386
That's not wise,
not until we know what it's doing.

13:45.521 --> 13:48.806
Agreed.
Stand down phasers, Mr Worf.

13:49.566 --> 13:52.022
In the meantime,
take us out of range.

13:52.152 --> 13:54.904
Thrusters only, 100kph,
nice and easy.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.106
- Aye, sir.
- Data?

13:57.241 --> 14:01.025
The probe is moving with us,
holding relative position.

14:01.161 --> 14:05.657
It's connected itself to him,
like a tether.

14:11.296 --> 14:16.172
You've been dreaming about
your starship again, haven't you?

14:16.301 --> 14:20.002
I'm just charting the progress
of the course of the sun.

14:20.972 --> 14:25.101
It might give a clue
to the cause of this drought.

14:27.145 --> 14:31.273
I think you're still
trying to figure out where you are.

14:32.609 --> 14:34.898
Where that ship of yours is.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.942
How to get back to that life.

14:42.410 --> 14:45.744
The memory is five years old now.

14:47.749 --> 14:49.872
But it's still inside me.

14:51.961 --> 14:55.580
Was your life there
so much better than this?

14:55.715 --> 14:59.131
So much more gratifying,
so much more fulfilling,

14:59.260 --> 15:02.925
that you cling to it
with such stubbornness?

15:03.056 --> 15:06.306
- Eline...
- It must have been extraordinary.

15:07.560 --> 15:11.143
But never in all the stories
you've told me

15:11.272 --> 15:14.973
have you mentioned anyone
who loved you as I do.

15:20.740 --> 15:22.318
It was real.

15:22.450 --> 15:25.237
It was as real as this is.

15:27.872 --> 15:33.708
And you can't expect me
to forget a lifetime spent there.

15:34.337 --> 15:38.833
Yes, I can.
I've been patient, Kamin.

15:39.550 --> 15:43.334
For five years,
I've shared you with that other life.

15:44.305 --> 15:47.341
I've listened,
I've tried to understand.

15:48.517 --> 15:50.510
And I have waited.

15:51.854 --> 15:56.812
- When do I get you back?
- I know.

15:58.069 --> 15:59.693
It has been hard on you.

15:59.820 --> 16:05.609
When will you let go? When will you
start living this life?

16:06.619 --> 16:08.658
When will we start a family?

16:10.414 --> 16:15.290
- Kamin. Eline. Good morning.
- Good morning, Batai.

16:15.419 --> 16:17.992
Are you ready?
The Administrator's here.

16:18.130 --> 16:20.668
Yes. Will you come along?

16:21.425 --> 16:25.672
No, thank you.
You do very well on your own.

16:30.267 --> 16:34.431
She always was strong-minded,
even as a child.

16:34.563 --> 16:40.103
It's not her fault. These past few
years have been difficult for her.

16:40.235 --> 16:42.726
And for you, I think.

16:54.082 --> 16:55.363
There you are, Batai.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.916
Perhaps you can explain,
when crops are dying all over,

16:59.045 --> 17:01.287
how this tree is flourishing?

17:01.423 --> 17:05.800
Well, this tree is our symbol.
Our affirmation of life.

17:05.926 --> 17:10.470
Everyone gives part of
their water rations to keep it alive.

17:10.598 --> 17:12.805
We've learned, Administrator,

17:12.934 --> 17:16.349
that hope is a powerful weapon
against anything.

17:16.479 --> 17:18.970
- Even drought.
- A good point.

17:19.107 --> 17:23.568
Perhaps I'll recommend a symbolic
tree in each of my communities.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.733
What business have we today?

17:25.864 --> 17:29.315
We need help
to increase the water supply.

17:29.451 --> 17:32.866
We think there are ways
to reclaim some of our water.

17:32.996 --> 17:35.487
You're being a bit of an alarmist.

17:35.623 --> 17:40.202
True, we're in a drought, but water
rationing has produced savings.

17:40.336 --> 17:44.630
If the weather doesn't change,
we'll run out of water.

17:45.174 --> 17:47.416
- Who is this?
- Kamin, sir.

17:48.803 --> 17:50.463
Kamin!

17:53.224 --> 17:55.217
- Do I know you?
- No.

17:55.351 --> 17:57.676
I haven't spoken to you before.

17:57.812 --> 18:00.766
Kamin, I'm open
to all the people of this town.

18:00.898 --> 18:03.354
I'm delighted to hear
what you have to say.

18:05.820 --> 18:09.236
I suggest that we build
atmospheric condensers

18:09.365 --> 18:12.070
which could extract water
from the air.

18:13.119 --> 18:16.404
I don't mean to quash
your very creative ideas,

18:16.539 --> 18:20.583
but building atmospheric condensers
would be a monumental undertaking.

18:20.710 --> 18:22.916
We could not sustain such a project.

18:23.045 --> 18:25.583
Each community
will be responsible for its own.

18:25.715 --> 18:29.546
It's a choice between watering
our crops, and watching them die.

18:30.261 --> 18:33.012
Well, I'll be glad
to pass along your idea.

18:33.139 --> 18:37.468
This kind of participatory government
works for everyone.

18:38.060 --> 18:41.227
Be well, Batai.
I shall see you next month.

18:42.398 --> 18:44.437
Good to meet you... Kanan.

18:45.568 --> 18:48.521
Go carefully, Administrator.

18:50.864 --> 18:55.325
That went very well.
I think he was impressed with you.

18:56.495 --> 18:59.531
But there'll be
no atmospheric condensers.

18:59.665 --> 19:04.410
These things take time.
But it will happen, I'm sure of it.

19:05.379 --> 19:08.296
Come and have supper tonight,
old friend.

19:08.423 --> 19:11.211
I'll make some vegetable stew.

19:11.343 --> 19:15.044
Let's talk about building
our own condenser.

19:15.180 --> 19:16.924
Kamin.

19:17.057 --> 19:20.177
Hearing you talk
to the Administrator,

19:20.310 --> 19:23.596
I realise that,
for the first time in years,

19:23.730 --> 19:28.606
you were speaking as though you were
truly a member of the community.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.858
It was good to hear that again.

19:54.552 --> 19:58.171
You've been brooding
behind that flute all evening.

19:58.723 --> 20:03.100
I'm not brooding.
I'm immersed in my music.

20:04.145 --> 20:05.853
Music.

20:07.524 --> 20:10.690
I find that it helps me to think,

20:10.819 --> 20:14.567
but the real surprise is
I enjoy it so much.

20:14.697 --> 20:17.651
No, the real surprise is
you're actually improving!

20:21.579 --> 20:23.536
- Batai.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:24.540 --> 20:27.791
- Go home.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.925
- Goodnight, Kamin.
- Goodnight, my friend.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.594
Go carefully, Batai.

20:44.727 --> 20:49.056
Don't forget these!
I won't put them away for you again.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.268
Yes, ma'am!

20:56.656 --> 21:01.116
I've done nothing but nag all day.
I'm sorry.

21:02.453 --> 21:04.611
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

21:07.208 --> 21:11.157
Everything you said this morning
was absolutely correct.

21:12.213 --> 21:16.709
I feel that I have given you so
little and you have given me so much.

21:17.927 --> 21:19.385
No.

21:20.804 --> 21:25.513
You're a good man.
A wonderful husband. I didn't mean...

21:25.643 --> 21:28.216
No, not such a wonderful husband.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.809
I spend my time charting the stars.

21:30.939 --> 21:35.233
I disappear for days at a time,
exploring the countryside.

21:36.195 --> 21:41.070
My life is very much as it was.
Old habits.

21:42.534 --> 21:45.072
You're gentle and kind.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.873
You never once
raised your voice to me.

21:49.082 --> 21:52.119
I'd like your permission
to build something.

21:52.753 --> 21:56.252
You've built your telescope,
your laboratory.

21:56.381 --> 22:00.628
- You don't need my permission.
- In this case, I do.

22:02.137 --> 22:03.797
What is it?

22:05.557 --> 22:07.384
A nursery.

22:11.855 --> 22:13.183
Really?

22:17.944 --> 22:19.486
Really?

22:19.613 --> 22:23.562
Unless, of course,
you would prefer a porch.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.491
It would be easier to build.

22:25.619 --> 22:28.406
- I could make a start right away.
- No.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.636
Any progress identifying the probe?

22:48.766 --> 22:52.218
Maybe. We've picked up
residue on the probe's shell.

22:52.353 --> 22:57.146
It may be from the propulsion system.
They used a solid propellant as fuel.

22:57.275 --> 22:58.555
A solid propellant?

22:58.693 --> 23:03.070
Crystalline emiristol.
It produces a trail we can trace.

23:03.197 --> 23:06.780
We can send our own probe
and trace it back to the origin.

23:06.909 --> 23:08.154
I'll get right on it.

23:08.286 --> 23:10.741
I have analysed the nucleonic beam.

23:10.872 --> 23:14.620
It may be possible to reflect
the particles back to the probe

23:14.750 --> 23:17.787
- To disrupt the signal.
- Doctor?

23:17.920 --> 23:20.625
I don't know the risk
of shutting down the beam.

23:20.756 --> 23:23.045
I won't let it
keep drilling into him!

23:23.175 --> 23:27.422
If somebody gets stabbed,
you don't just pull the knife out.

23:27.555 --> 23:29.844
It may do more harm than leaving it.

23:29.974 --> 23:32.891
The Captain is under attack.
We must act.

23:33.019 --> 23:36.886
I'm inclined to agree.
Doctor, monitor him closely.

23:37.022 --> 23:39.810
Mr Data, prepare to disrupt the beam.

23:39.942 --> 23:42.647
We're going to try to cut this cord.

24:16.603 --> 24:17.979
Meribor!

24:25.404 --> 24:30.066
Meribor, this is your brother's
ceremony. Don't fidget, now.

24:44.047 --> 24:48.756
We name this child for
a dear friend who died a year ago.

24:48.885 --> 24:53.594
But now, his memory will live on
in his namesake.

24:54.182 --> 24:58.429
We name you Batai, in his honour.

24:59.354 --> 25:03.138
And he's starting out
in the warmth of friends. Thank you.

25:03.274 --> 25:05.433
Help yourselves to something to eat.

25:13.284 --> 25:15.954
- Congratulations, Kamin.
- Thank you.

25:19.123 --> 25:24.331
It seems like only yesterday
we had Meribor's naming ceremony.

25:25.046 --> 25:26.291
Go on!

25:27.924 --> 25:32.965
I remember. I was so nervous,
I was afraid that I would drop her.

25:35.473 --> 25:39.601
- Now look at the little lady.
- She's no lady!

25:39.727 --> 25:43.013
Tromping through the hills
with you all day,

25:43.147 --> 25:46.647
digging up those soil samples
you insist on collecting.

25:46.776 --> 25:48.852
She's her father's daughter.

25:48.986 --> 25:53.316
I always believed that I didn't need
children to complete my life.

25:53.449 --> 25:56.118
Now I couldn't imagine life
without them.

26:04.418 --> 26:06.292
Kamin, what is it?

26:09.006 --> 26:10.798
Get the doctor. Hurry!

26:11.675 --> 26:14.131
His respiratory system's in spasm.

26:14.261 --> 26:16.587
Pulse is irregular and weakening.

26:16.722 --> 26:19.640
- I'm losing him.
- Somatophysical failure.

26:19.767 --> 26:21.047
2cc delactovine!

26:25.439 --> 26:27.515
Data, get that beam back!

26:27.650 --> 26:31.730
Fluctuations in the isocortex.
Synaptic responses failing.

26:31.862 --> 26:33.938
Begin full cardiac induction.

26:34.073 --> 26:37.488
Blood pressure is dropping rapidly.
70 over 20.

26:37.618 --> 26:41.236
- Data, re-establish that beam!
- I am attempting to do so.

26:41.371 --> 26:44.657
- Losing response.
- Cortical stimulators.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.621
Start at ten percent.

26:48.754 --> 26:51.624
The beam is fully restored, Doctor.

26:53.383 --> 26:58.092
Blood pressure up to 90 over 40
and rising.

26:58.221 --> 27:03.892
Isocortical functions stabilising,
vital signs approaching normal.

27:12.652 --> 27:16.353
- Meribor.
- Happy day, Father.

27:16.490 --> 27:18.778
That's my hobby. Find your own!

27:18.909 --> 27:20.700
You're the one who taught me.

27:20.827 --> 27:24.161
Don't complain
if you turned me into a scientist.

27:24.289 --> 27:27.290
What has the scientist
been up to today?

27:27.417 --> 27:29.457
Analysing soil samples.

27:30.629 --> 27:34.792
There isn't any anaerobic bacteria.
The soil is dead.

27:36.968 --> 27:39.720
This isn't just a very long drought,
is it?

27:39.846 --> 27:42.135
My log entries go back ten years.

27:42.265 --> 27:45.183
You have data preceding that
for 15 years.

27:45.310 --> 27:47.433
You've reached the same conclusion.

27:47.562 --> 27:49.601
I haven't reached any conclusion.

27:49.731 --> 27:52.685
A good scientist
doesn't function by conjecture.

27:52.817 --> 27:55.569
A good scientist functions
by hypothesising

27:55.695 --> 27:59.479
then proving or disproving
that hypothesis. That's what I did.

27:59.616 --> 28:02.616
You should see more
of that young man Dannick.

28:02.744 --> 28:04.653
You are changing the subject.

28:04.787 --> 28:09.330
I'm not. I'm just hypothesising
that he's in love with you.

28:10.877 --> 28:16.167
You've taught me to pursue the
truth, no matter how painful it is.

28:16.299 --> 28:20.842
It's too late to back off now.
This planet is dying.

28:24.390 --> 28:27.759
Perhaps I should have filled
your head with trivia.

28:27.894 --> 28:30.894
Games and toys and clothes.

28:31.022 --> 28:35.019
- I don't think you mean that.
- No, I don't.

28:36.986 --> 28:39.144
It just...

28:39.280 --> 28:42.150
It saddens me to see you...

28:43.534 --> 28:47.484
...burdened with the knowledge
of things you can't change.

28:49.331 --> 28:55.749
I think I should marry Dannick sooner
rather than later, don't you?

28:56.714 --> 29:00.581
Seize the time, Meribor. Live now.

29:01.135 --> 29:05.547
Make now
always the most precious time.

29:07.141 --> 29:09.762
Now will never come again.

29:11.729 --> 29:14.054
I love you, Father.

29:22.281 --> 29:24.190
His vital signs are holding.

29:24.324 --> 29:27.528
They've been stable
since the beam was restored.

29:27.661 --> 29:31.445
Cmdr Riker. We've received telemetry
from the probe we launched.

29:31.582 --> 29:32.613
Go ahead.

29:32.749 --> 29:36.284
We charted
the alien probe's radiation trail.

29:36.420 --> 29:38.293
Can you extrapolate an origin?

29:38.422 --> 29:41.921
A star system in the Silarian Sector.
Kataan.

29:42.050 --> 29:43.959
Never heard of it. Data?

29:44.094 --> 29:46.549
An unmapped system of six planets.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.087
- Any of them inhabited?
- Not now.

29:49.224 --> 29:50.802
The star went nova.

29:50.934 --> 29:54.848
All life in this system
was destroyed 1,000 years ago.

30:15.250 --> 30:18.167
I've put away your shoes
for you again.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.121
Yes, thank you, dear.

30:24.717 --> 30:29.095
I've been looking through this thing
on and off for over 30 years.

30:29.222 --> 30:33.054
And I still don't see what you
and Meribor find so fascinating.

30:33.184 --> 30:38.689
Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down
and have a rest like you should do.

30:38.815 --> 30:41.650
You treat me like some frail flower.

30:41.776 --> 30:43.815
People have surgery all the time.

30:48.741 --> 30:50.650
He loves playing.

30:51.786 --> 30:54.111
He's quite good at it,
don't you think?

30:54.247 --> 30:56.654
He loves doing a lot of things.

30:56.791 --> 31:01.749
Last week, all he wanted to be was
a botanist. Before that, a sculptor.

31:03.422 --> 31:06.423
I wish he would find
some focus in his life.

31:07.635 --> 31:09.509
I think he has.

31:14.266 --> 31:16.473
Maybe you should talk to him.

31:19.397 --> 31:20.772
Batai!

31:28.113 --> 31:29.442
Father?

31:29.573 --> 31:33.025
Your mother thinks
you have something to tell me.

31:38.707 --> 31:40.332
Yes.

31:45.631 --> 31:49.794
I was waiting for the right moment,
but that will never come.

31:50.886 --> 31:54.670
- I'm leaving school.
- Leaving school? No, you're not!

31:54.807 --> 31:59.018
I want to concentrate on my music.
That's what I care about.

31:59.144 --> 32:02.893
Last year, it was mathematics.
Before that, botany...

32:03.023 --> 32:06.558
Through it all,
there was my music.

32:09.655 --> 32:11.896
I think you know that, Father.

32:14.117 --> 32:16.608
This is the life I want.

32:18.914 --> 32:21.156
Well, we'll...

32:23.376 --> 32:26.627
- We'll discuss it.
- Thank you, Father.

32:33.845 --> 32:36.716
Even after all these years,

32:36.848 --> 32:40.264
you still have the ability
to surprise me.

32:41.311 --> 32:44.929
If music is what he wants,
why should I stand in his way?

32:50.862 --> 32:57.280
Anyway, who knows how much time
he'll have to follow any dream?

32:59.537 --> 33:03.120
Are you still planning to talk
to the Administrator tomorrow?

33:04.876 --> 33:07.960
There's a possibility
he'll dismiss me from the Council.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.879
Unless you keep quiet.

33:10.006 --> 33:16.590
No. The evidence is too pronounced.
I can't stay silent.

33:16.721 --> 33:18.464
What a surprise...

33:23.352 --> 33:26.472
Kamin, what do you hope
to accomplish?

33:26.606 --> 33:30.520
Spreading rumours that the planet
is doomed. There could be chaos.

33:30.651 --> 33:34.020
The facts are here! Show them
to someone who understands.

33:34.155 --> 33:37.358
I won't be a party
to your making trouble!

33:37.491 --> 33:40.113
If you won't take them, I will!

33:47.835 --> 33:51.584
Your observations, your findings...

33:51.714 --> 33:55.332
Our scientists reached
those conclusions two years ago.

33:57.261 --> 34:02.006
What did you expect us to do?
Make it public? Lmagine the effect!

34:02.141 --> 34:06.969
But surely, technology must exist
to save something of this world.

34:07.104 --> 34:11.351
Perhaps...
some people could be evacuated.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.271
Evacuated where?
Our technology is limited.

34:14.402 --> 34:17.320
We're just beginning
to launch small missiles.

34:17.447 --> 34:21.112
A collection of genetic samples.
Something! Anything!

34:21.243 --> 34:23.781
You cannot let this civilisation die!

34:23.911 --> 34:24.992
Enough!

34:28.417 --> 34:33.577
There is a plan in work.
I can't tell you more than that.

34:33.714 --> 34:35.505
Father!

34:36.049 --> 34:38.291
- What is it?
- It's Mother. Hurry!

34:45.976 --> 34:47.553
Doctor?

34:48.937 --> 34:51.262
Kamin, I'm sorry.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.350
See?

34:55.485 --> 34:59.697
I go to any lengths
to get your attention.

34:59.823 --> 35:02.824
You always did have a flair
for the dramatic!

35:03.493 --> 35:05.700
Doctor, thank you.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.784
Batai.

35:12.752 --> 35:15.124
Leave us alone for a moment.

35:15.255 --> 35:16.535
I...

35:17.090 --> 35:19.498
I need to talk to my husband.

35:27.308 --> 35:31.092
Did you show the Administrator
your evidence?

35:31.229 --> 35:35.179
I didn't have to. They already knew.

35:35.316 --> 35:39.943
So, he won't throw you
off the Council?

35:40.446 --> 35:42.356
No.

35:43.324 --> 35:44.949
Good.

35:52.041 --> 35:53.535
Remember...

35:55.336 --> 35:57.542
...put your shoes away.

35:58.297 --> 36:00.089
I promise.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.234
Gotcha!

36:31.914 --> 36:34.322
Now I gotcha!

36:37.878 --> 36:41.461
Some children are certainly
making a lot of noise in here!

36:41.590 --> 36:44.757
You shouldn't be outside so long.
It's damaging.

36:44.885 --> 36:47.008
I'm wearing your skin protector.

36:47.137 --> 36:51.633
And you, young man?
Do you wear your skin protector?

36:51.767 --> 36:54.602
You do? Good boy.

36:54.728 --> 36:57.895
Happy day.
It's time to see the launching.

36:58.023 --> 37:00.312
What launching? What's he saying?

37:00.442 --> 37:03.941
They're sending up a missile.
We are going to watch it.

37:04.071 --> 37:06.194
I'm not going anywhere!

37:06.323 --> 37:09.240
Come on, Kamie. Hurry up now.

37:09.785 --> 37:11.943
Let's go see the launching.

37:16.124 --> 37:18.331
It breaks my heart to look at him.

37:18.460 --> 37:21.496
- Who?
- My grandson.

37:24.049 --> 37:26.338
It breaks my heart.

37:27.511 --> 37:31.259
He deserves a rich, full life
and he's not going to get one.

37:36.394 --> 37:38.304
Please come, Father.

37:45.570 --> 37:48.192
Why didn't I hear
about the launching?

37:55.372 --> 37:58.871
Did everyone know about this
except me?

37:59.000 --> 38:03.164
I'll...
I'll be alright sitting here.

38:04.547 --> 38:06.207
You go off with the others.

38:06.341 --> 38:09.507
Hold on to my grandson
and watch the damn thing go up

38:09.636 --> 38:11.379
for all the good it'll do!

38:11.512 --> 38:13.470
What are they launching?

38:16.893 --> 38:21.471
You know about it, Father.
You've already seen it.

38:21.606 --> 38:26.683
Seen it? What are you talking about?
I haven't seen any missile.

38:26.819 --> 38:31.066
Yes, you have, old friend.
Don't you remember?

38:39.373 --> 38:40.702
Batai!

38:43.169 --> 38:46.620
You saw it
just before you came here.

38:47.381 --> 38:51.331
We hoped our probe would encounter
someone in the future.

38:51.469 --> 38:54.256
Someone who could be a teacher.

38:54.388 --> 38:57.757
Someone who could tell
the others about us.

39:00.519 --> 39:02.678
It's me!

39:03.731 --> 39:05.439
Isn't it?

39:06.734 --> 39:08.691
I'm the someone.

39:11.614 --> 39:14.531
I'm the one you find.

39:16.076 --> 39:18.614
That's what this launching is.

39:19.705 --> 39:23.537
A probe that finds me in the future.

39:23.667 --> 39:25.043
Yes, my love.

39:28.756 --> 39:30.416
Eline!

39:34.553 --> 39:37.922
The rest of us
have been gone a thousand years.

39:38.056 --> 39:40.345
If you remember what we were,

39:40.475 --> 39:44.425
and how we lived,
then we'll have found life again.

39:52.487 --> 39:53.946
Eline.

40:10.547 --> 40:12.456
Now we live in you.

40:13.633 --> 40:17.548
Tell them of us, my darling.

40:23.727 --> 40:25.387
Something's happening.

40:26.604 --> 40:30.223
The nucleonic beam has ceased.
The probe has shut down.

40:30.358 --> 40:32.434
Cerebral functions are stabilising.

40:32.569 --> 40:35.854
Mr Worf, get that probe
in bay two for examination.

40:35.989 --> 40:37.613
Yes, Commander.

40:40.368 --> 40:41.993
What...?

40:43.913 --> 40:47.531
Please, Captain,
don't get up too quickly.

40:50.753 --> 40:52.129
Captain?

40:56.801 --> 40:59.126
This is the Enterprise.

41:01.973 --> 41:03.965
I'm Jean-Luc Picard.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.731
How long...?

41:13.609 --> 41:15.851
20, 25 minutes.

41:18.406 --> 41:20.445
25 minutes?!

41:27.248 --> 41:31.708
I want you in sickbay. I'd like
to run a full diagnostic on you.

41:33.462 --> 41:35.371
Dr Crusher...

42:26.974 --> 42:28.765
Come!

42:31.520 --> 42:33.845
Hello, sir. Feeling better?

42:33.980 --> 42:36.816
Yes. Yes, thank you.

42:38.026 --> 42:40.268
Well, I find that I'm...

42:41.238 --> 42:45.401
I'm having to rediscover
that this is really my home.

42:46.743 --> 42:49.993
We were able to open the probe
and examine it.

42:50.121 --> 42:53.621
Whatever it was that locked on to you
was self-terminating.

42:53.750 --> 42:59.871
It isn't functioning any longer.
We found this inside.
