00:20.316 --> 00:22.520
Hey, Fisher,
get a load of this.

00:22.607 --> 00:25.628
Huh. That's the fourth weirdest
thing we've caught today.

00:25.715 --> 00:28.787
Get your fish hands off me,
ya filthy fisherman!

00:28.874 --> 00:31.373
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Fisherperson."

00:31.460 --> 00:33.520
I mean, your name
is Mann, Mann.

00:33.607 --> 00:36.520
Yeah, well, He don't know
I'm a fisher, Fisher.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.918
I've never seen this joker
before in my life.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.418
Enough!
Don't ya know who I am?

00:41.505 --> 00:43.665
No. Who are you?

00:44.554 --> 00:47.892

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Ballad of Duke Baloney!"</font>

01:47.189 --> 01:50.826
<i>Four months after the mysterious
disappearance of its CEO,</i>

01:50.913 --> 01:55.022
Glomgold Industries is finally
under new, not crazy management.

01:55.109 --> 01:57.084
<i>She's dynamic.
She's exciting.</i>

01:57.171 --> 01:59.489
<i>She's never threatened
revenge on anyone.</i>

01:59.576 --> 02:01.927
<i>She's Zan Owlson.</i>

02:02.079 --> 02:03.750
<i>Um, hi, everyone.
Happy to...</i>

02:03.837 --> 02:06.288
<i>Top of Her Class at
Mouseton School of Business,</i>

02:06.375 --> 02:09.734
<i>Owlson founded the global
charity "Change For Chicks."</i>

02:09.821 --> 02:11.436
<i>She's a formidable replacement</i>

02:11.523 --> 02:14.061
<i>for failed former leader
Flintheart Glomgold.</i>

02:14.148 --> 02:16.149
<i>We cut unnecessary
departments</i>

02:16.236 --> 02:18.084
<i>like Harebrained Schemes,
Mindless Revenge.</i>

02:18.171 --> 02:20.351
The company was spending
a lot of money on sharks.

02:20.438 --> 02:22.351
Owlson is even
forming a new charity

02:22.438 --> 02:26.061
along with the company's
chief rival, McDuck Enterprises.

02:26.148 --> 02:29.584
It's time this company put
people above profits.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.936
Here at the new
Glomgold Industries,

02:32.023 --> 02:35.451
our community is the greatest
treasure of all.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.914
Ah, fishing.

02:52.001 --> 02:54.685
The noble struggle
of man versus nature...

02:54.772 --> 02:56.742
The you gently
rowing me around

02:56.829 --> 02:58.373
for several hours
while I nap...

02:58.460 --> 03:01.529
The jumping and throwing
of pointy sticks! Hyah!

03:01.616 --> 03:05.536
Ew, gross!
Can't you just use these?

03:05.633 --> 03:08.436
Sure. But no rusty fishhook
is complete without...

03:08.523 --> 03:11.021
Bait! Get your bait here!

03:15.321 --> 03:17.274
- Aah! Glomgold!
- Aah! Glomgold!

03:17.361 --> 03:19.499
Hello, children.
Bait for sale.

03:19.586 --> 03:23.141
Buy seven tentacles, the eighth is free.
Buckets of savings.

03:23.228 --> 03:24.923
Uh, Glomgold?

03:28.258 --> 03:30.121
What's with
the South African accent?

03:30.208 --> 03:33.267
Why is your posture so good?
What's on your face?

03:33.641 --> 03:35.271
Eh, just a bushy beard

03:35.358 --> 03:38.296
forged from a life
on the sea.

03:40.071 --> 03:41.906
What's your angle,
Glomgold?

03:41.993 --> 03:44.123
What'd say there
about the Glomthere... what?

03:44.210 --> 03:46.615
You kids disrespectin'
our new employee?

03:46.702 --> 03:49.531
'Cause Bait 'n' Such
is a bully-free zone.

03:49.618 --> 03:51.318
I was just
introducing myself.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.896
The name's Duke Baloney. Like
the humble sandwich meat.

03:54.983 --> 03:56.827
More like
Mr. Full of Baloney.

03:56.914 --> 04:00.171
- Excuse us for one second, Mr. Baloney.
- "Full of Baloney."

04:00.258 --> 04:02.423
It's an old-timey expression.
You know, it means...

04:02.510 --> 04:05.656
I get it, but this is no time
for hilarious, hilarious jokes.

04:05.743 --> 04:07.873
Glomgold's been missing
for months, then bam!

04:07.960 --> 04:10.766
He's back as a completely
different person.

04:10.930 --> 04:14.583
He's clearly dealing with some kind
of amnesia. We gotta help him.

04:14.670 --> 04:17.555
Please. Faking amnesia
is like Con Man 101.

04:17.642 --> 04:21.594
This is obviously some kind of setup
to trap us and destroy Uncle Scrooge.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.756
Once a bad guy,
always a bad guy.

04:23.843 --> 04:24.968
Hey.

04:25.772 --> 04:28.210
Oh, you.

04:28.297 --> 04:31.343
Maybe this bad guy is
transforming into a good guy.

04:31.773 --> 04:33.076
Like a reverse werewolf!

04:33.163 --> 04:35.929
For the last time,
there are no reverse werewolves.

04:36.016 --> 04:37.594
I'm telling you,
that's Glomgold!

04:37.681 --> 04:39.644
How can you be
so sure it's him?

04:42.222 --> 04:44.277
Curse you, rope!

04:44.364 --> 04:45.709
It's him.

04:54.181 --> 04:57.295
Sorry for yellin'.
Never acted like that before.

04:57.382 --> 04:59.927
That I know of.

05:00.101 --> 05:03.515
Heh. This guy! Found 'em in
the bay with no memories.

05:03.602 --> 05:05.247
Just his determination

05:05.334 --> 05:08.608
and a freakishly high
tolerance for pain.

05:13.672 --> 05:15.844
It's like
he was made for livin'

05:15.931 --> 05:18.594
a hard knock-life
on the open water.

05:18.681 --> 05:22.474
All I need to know is that
I came from the sea,

05:22.561 --> 05:24.523
and I'll die by it.

05:24.610 --> 05:26.608
His life is like a haiku.

05:26.695 --> 05:29.265
Yeah. It's vague garbage that
structurally makes no sense.

05:29.352 --> 05:32.317
He's obviously lying. That's
Glomgold, and I'll prove it.

05:32.404 --> 05:35.943
Hey, Baloney Sandwich, you know
who you gotta meet? Our uncle.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.528
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. He's very rich,

05:38.615 --> 05:40.991
very Scottish,
no beard,

05:41.078 --> 05:45.055
but easily the best
billionaire of all time:

05:45.142 --> 05:47.046
Scrooge McDuck!
Don't hit me.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.008
He sounds nice.

05:49.722 --> 05:51.359
Duke, are you sure

05:51.446 --> 05:54.614
the name Glomgold
doesn't sound familiar?

05:54.804 --> 05:57.476
Wait. You think
strappin', noble Duke,

05:57.563 --> 05:58.952
legend of the docks,

05:59.039 --> 06:02.255
is that withered, gross
old husk of a man?

06:02.342 --> 06:05.007
Hey, Duke, now that
you're a billionaire,

06:05.094 --> 06:07.560
you gonna buy a round
of Pep for everyone here?

06:07.647 --> 06:10.593
- Sure. Why not?
- Duke! Duke!

06:10.680 --> 06:12.756
- Duke! Duke!
- Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke!

06:12.843 --> 06:14.385
What?
I want a free Pep.

06:14.472 --> 06:16.844
Duke! Duke! Duke!
Wait. Huh?

06:16.931 --> 06:18.830
Duke! Duke!
Duke! Duke!

06:19.094 --> 06:22.529
Why would a simple fishmonger
have a money clip like that?

06:22.616 --> 06:23.679
I don't know,

06:23.766 --> 06:26.027
but we're gonna find out.

06:26.774 --> 06:29.077

06:34.709 --> 06:38.388
Oh, it looks like the McDuck
Enterprises fishing boat is back.

06:38.475 --> 06:40.055
Welcome home.

06:40.142 --> 06:42.279
Best fishing boat
on the sea.

06:42.399 --> 06:44.452
You mean second best.

06:44.539 --> 06:47.404
Because we're obviously the
best fishing boat on the sea.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.135
Aw, you're sweet.

06:49.222 --> 06:52.094
Sure, we have a scrappy,
working-class charm, but...

06:52.181 --> 06:54.412
But nothing.
You guys are great.

06:54.499 --> 06:56.148
We have to be the best.

06:56.235 --> 06:58.447
Nothing wrong
with coming in second.

06:58.534 --> 07:01.094
You know I heard
that first is the worst

07:01.181 --> 07:03.335
and second
is the best.

07:05.735 --> 07:09.742
I don't know why,
but I hate that boat.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.157
Come on, Duke.

07:11.244 --> 07:13.568
Sea shanties don't
sing themselves!

07:13.655 --> 07:14.988
Coming.

07:24.073 --> 07:26.296
See?
Not a scheme in sight.

07:26.383 --> 07:28.460
Glomgold actually has
amnesia and is now

07:28.547 --> 07:30.335
obviously just a
simple fishmonger.

07:30.422 --> 07:32.928
That's what you said when he
was a "humble delivery man"

07:33.015 --> 07:34.997
and an "unassuming
pastry chef."

07:35.084 --> 07:36.976
Give it time.
He'll slip up.

07:43.788 --> 07:48.060
Hmm.

07:52.516 --> 07:55.271
Howdy, fellas!
Come jump out of the water

07:55.358 --> 07:57.196
and hang out with me!

07:58.290 --> 07:59.926
Duke, what are you doing?

08:00.610 --> 08:02.224
Hey fellas!

08:02.311 --> 08:05.000
And ladies!

08:05.133 --> 08:07.249
Now I'll catch
twice as many fish!

08:07.336 --> 08:09.459
Huh. I don't know
<i>what</i> this proves.

08:22.485 --> 08:24.476
Boat meeting!

08:26.012 --> 08:27.885
Whoa. Duke, you okay?

08:27.972 --> 08:30.624
Ugh. You look like
you didn't sleep much.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.515
Who needs sleep when you've
devised the perfect scheme?

08:33.602 --> 08:36.148
Behold!
My ingenious plan

08:36.235 --> 08:39.125
to catch more fish than 
the McDuck boat!

08:39.836 --> 08:42.405
I don't get the joke.

08:42.493 --> 08:45.450
We start here,
with a simple shrimp cook-off.

08:45.610 --> 08:46.976
Or so it seems.

08:47.063 --> 08:49.513
I knew it!
Someone's Glomgold is showing.

08:49.625 --> 08:52.152
He's clearly struggling
with repressed memories.

08:52.239 --> 08:53.239
We gotta help him.

08:53.326 --> 08:56.113
That's exactly what he wants
us to do, and then surprise,

08:56.200 --> 08:58.472
we're trapped inside
a volcano full of shark bombs.

08:58.559 --> 09:01.075
Glomgold might do that,
but not our Duke.

09:01.162 --> 09:04.370
And that's how we strap
the bombs to the sharks. Now...

09:06.115 --> 09:09.448
After getting our engineering degrees
from a local community college,

09:09.535 --> 09:13.308
we program the previously brainwashed
robotic fish from step 17A

09:13.395 --> 09:16.011
to surround McDuck's boat
and insult them.

09:16.098 --> 09:19.794
While their egos are shattered,
we search for what I assume

09:19.881 --> 09:22.003
is a giant plug
on the floor of the bay,

09:22.090 --> 09:26.143
drain the bay, then collect
all the fish for ourselves!

09:26.295 --> 09:29.333
Hey Duke, this is some
real nice cardboard art,

09:29.420 --> 09:32.932
but if we overfish, there won't
be any left for the community.

09:33.019 --> 09:35.512
Because we'll
have all the fish!

09:35.599 --> 09:39.281
But it's like you always say,
"Sharing is caring."

09:39.368 --> 09:42.036
That does sound like me.
Or does it?

09:42.123 --> 09:43.932
Besides, storm's a-brewin'.

09:44.019 --> 09:45.655
No one should be
fishing anyway.

09:45.742 --> 09:48.053
That's why the fish
will never see it coming!

09:53.010 --> 09:55.025
Uh, just kidding?

09:56.802 --> 09:58.673
Ah, what a joker,
this Duke.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.342
Duke of the jokes
is more like it, huh?

10:03.545 --> 10:06.557
This isn't over, boat.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.802
He said he was
just kidding.

10:08.889 --> 10:11.028
He doesn't remember
being Glomgold.

10:11.115 --> 10:14.284
Every con says that when they're busted.
I say it all the time!

10:14.371 --> 10:16.458
Ugh, what are you
up to, Glomgold?

10:16.545 --> 10:19.526
- There's only one way to find out!
- Oh, don't say it.

10:19.642 --> 10:21.673
To research!

10:23.381 --> 10:26.042
Okay, here's all
the information we have.

10:26.185 --> 10:29.559
If only there was a visual
way to organize it all.

10:29.646 --> 10:30.940
You built a board,
I'm guessing?

10:31.027 --> 10:33.861
I built a board!
We've got Duke,

10:33.948 --> 10:35.879
Glomgold,
the money clip,

10:35.966 --> 10:39.387
- and a whole lot of question marks.
- That's it?

10:39.474 --> 10:42.300
I couldn't find any record
of Duke Baloney anywhere.

10:42.387 --> 10:45.013
There's also no record
of Flintheart Glomgold

10:45.100 --> 10:48.013
before he arrived
in Duckburg in the 1980s.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.212
Nationality:
"The Most Scottish"?

10:51.299 --> 10:54.872
Ugh. We spent hours trying to
figure out who Duke Baloney is,

10:54.959 --> 10:57.176
and now we don't even know
who Glomgold is?

10:57.263 --> 10:59.173
There's got to be
somebody who can help us.

10:59.260 --> 11:01.736
Who's dealt with Glomgold
more than anyone?

11:25.947 --> 11:29.863
Stay back.
I'm in charge now.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.386
The ship's boiler is out.

11:33.473 --> 11:36.018
You must go below deck
to light it.

11:43.386 --> 11:45.551
Ship's boiler is out.

11:53.771 --> 11:55.578
Who's there?

11:55.771 --> 11:56.997
Stop!

12:20.092 --> 12:23.885
A heart-shaped flint?

12:24.903 --> 12:27.073
Ship's boiler is out.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.502
This gold is
glomming on to me!

12:50.877 --> 12:52.328
Just a dream.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.215
Eh, those never
mean anything.

13:02.124 --> 13:04.348
Good mornin',
sunshine.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.245
We got ya something.

13:06.529 --> 13:09.573
"Mann-Fisher-Duke."

13:09.670 --> 13:12.324
Now it's official.
You're part of the family.

13:12.730 --> 13:13.932
No big deal.

13:14.019 --> 13:17.301
Now we'll be
the Dukes of Fisher-Mann.

13:17.388 --> 13:19.562
Ah, geez, that woulda been
a way better sign.

13:19.649 --> 13:22.247
Wow. This is
the nicest thing

13:22.334 --> 13:25.498
anyone has even done
for me, I think.

13:25.670 --> 13:29.341
Oh, nothing could ruin this day.

13:31.287 --> 13:35.054
I'm looking
for Duke Baloney.

13:37.154 --> 13:38.614
Remember Uncle Scrooge,

13:38.701 --> 13:41.268
you just need to figure out
what's wrong with Glomgold.

13:41.355 --> 13:44.330
I know. I'm not
the one with amnesia.

13:45.888 --> 13:48.237
I wish we knew
what they were saying.

13:48.324 --> 13:50.020
Good thing
I can read lips.

13:50.107 --> 13:51.432
Foist me bagpipes!

13:51.519 --> 13:54.730
Hey, was Webby totally right
and you have amnesia?

13:54.817 --> 13:56.505
She sure was.

13:56.592 --> 13:59.792
Curse me kilt! That bright
young lass is full of promise!

13:59.879 --> 14:04.200
You said it. Boy, I wish she was
my housekeeper's granddaughter.

14:04.287 --> 14:06.667
Oh, no!
They're going to...

14:06.754 --> 14:10.239
Hug?
What is going on?

14:10.326 --> 14:12.309
That's Glomgold,
all right.

14:12.396 --> 14:14.706
And he does indeed
have amnesia.

14:14.793 --> 14:17.776
Ha! Told ya!
So, should we help him?

14:17.863 --> 14:20.239
- No.
- Ha! I told <i> you!</i>

14:20.326 --> 14:22.847
Because he's still fundamentally
a bad guy, right?

14:22.934 --> 14:24.823
- No.
- I'm sorry, come again?

14:24.910 --> 14:26.769
In all my years
of volleying

14:26.856 --> 14:28.809
with that vexatious
villain,

14:28.896 --> 14:31.886
I've never seen Flinty
happier or more at peace.

14:31.973 --> 14:33.989
Let him be Duke Baloney.

14:34.076 --> 14:37.379
- It's for his own good.
- But he might have a brain injury.

14:37.466 --> 14:40.919
Flintheart Glomgold blows
himself up on a daily basis.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.698
A simple brain injury
is actually a step up.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.489
Let this one be, kids.

14:46.576 --> 14:49.769
I'm off to unveil my new
charity with Zan Owlson,

14:49.856 --> 14:51.762
"Dimes for Ducklings."

14:51.849 --> 14:55.310
Hopefully I can talk her down to
"Pennies for Pipsqueaks" instead.

14:55.397 --> 14:58.901
- Huh.
- So, should we, uh,

14:59.029 --> 15:00.676
go fishing now or, uh...

15:00.763 --> 15:03.886
Oh, right. The thing we were gonna
do before this whole thing.

15:03.973 --> 15:05.505
- To fishing!
- To fishing!

15:13.302 --> 15:15.128
Don't know who I used to be,

15:15.215 --> 15:18.682
but I know who I am...
Duke Baloney.

15:18.771 --> 15:22.753
It's time for Glomgold
to Glom-go! Aah!

15:22.840 --> 15:25.557
I said, Glom-go!

15:30.068 --> 15:32.917
Aah! Kids!
Storm's a-coming!

15:33.943 --> 15:35.260
I'll save you,

15:35.826 --> 15:38.693
or my name isn't...

15:43.818 --> 15:47.042
Ah. Good-smelling
papaya here.

15:47.129 --> 15:48.753
Shoeshine!

15:49.201 --> 15:51.705
Shoeshine!
Get your shoeshine here!

15:55.576 --> 15:58.323
Can you
handle a pair of spats?

16:04.842 --> 16:06.895
Never met a shoe
I couldn't shine.

16:06.982 --> 16:09.066
So, what brings you
to South Africa?

16:09.153 --> 16:11.465
Let's just say a certain
savvy Scotsman

16:11.552 --> 16:13.722
got the Rain Queen
of Balobedu to make

16:13.809 --> 16:16.395
the Sahara Desert
a little less dry.

16:16.482 --> 16:19.011
Just another day at the
office for Scrooge McDuck.

16:19.098 --> 16:20.575
Must be a big deal

16:20.662 --> 16:23.222
if you're referring
to yourself in third person.

16:23.309 --> 16:26.614
You know, Duke Baloney
is kind of a big deal too.

16:26.701 --> 16:28.870
He's got tons of plans
to make himself

16:28.957 --> 16:30.659
the richest duck
in the world!

16:30.746 --> 16:33.105
First, I'll take
my shine money

16:33.192 --> 16:34.958
and buy a coal mine.

16:35.045 --> 16:38.489
Then I stomp on the coal so
hard, it turns to diamonds!

16:38.576 --> 16:40.292
Wouldn't that hurt
your feet?

16:40.379 --> 16:43.401
No, sir. I'm too stubborn
to know when I'm hurt!

16:43.488 --> 16:45.934
Anyway, I'll build
a massive drill

16:46.021 --> 16:49.417
with a diamond bit to drill
for gold and become rich!

16:49.504 --> 16:52.917
W-Why don't you just
cash in the diamonds?

16:53.725 --> 16:56.198
Then what would
I use for the drill?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.346
Good luck, lad.

17:09.140 --> 17:12.784
A dime? Shoeshine's a dollar.
Spats are extra.

17:12.871 --> 17:14.451
Plus tip!

17:14.632 --> 17:18.432
I was trying to teach you
a lesson in self-reliance.

17:18.519 --> 17:22.778
It's how I became the
richest duck in the world.

17:22.865 --> 17:25.011
You're the richest duck
in the world,

17:25.098 --> 17:27.262
and you only
gave me a dime?

17:27.348 --> 17:30.825
It's a symbolic gesture to teach
you to work for your fortune,

17:30.912 --> 17:33.009
which is better than
your half-cocked schemes.

17:33.287 --> 17:37.020
Are you mocking me?
How dare ya?

17:37.107 --> 17:39.182
You think you're so rich

17:39.269 --> 17:42.140
and so-o-o-o Scottish!

17:42.227 --> 17:44.424
I regret trying to help.

17:45.154 --> 17:48.474
Oh, you'll regret it,
all right.

17:50.984 --> 17:52.984
Missing something, McDuck?

17:53.631 --> 17:55.909
My schemes
are half-cocked, eh?

17:55.996 --> 17:58.417
Well, how's this
for full-cocked?

17:58.504 --> 18:00.753
<i>First, I'll use
your own money</i>

18:00.840 --> 18:03.877
<i>to create a superior
Scottish persona.</i>

18:03.967 --> 18:05.892
<i>Please pass the haggis.</i>

18:05.979 --> 18:08.411
Don't tell me what to do!

18:08.498 --> 18:11.511
<i>Finally, I'll dedicate
the rest of my life</i>

18:11.598 --> 18:13.591
<i>to besting Scrooge McDuck!</i>

18:15.349 --> 18:17.961
You'll rue the day
you crossed...

18:18.048 --> 18:22.091
- Duke! Duke! Duke!
- Duke's gonna save those kids!

18:23.729 --> 18:26.222
- Whoa!
- I hate fishing!

18:26.309 --> 18:28.659
Help! Save us!

18:44.309 --> 18:47.195
Give me your hand!

18:53.758 --> 18:56.381
Ah. Hyah!

19:04.726 --> 19:07.134
Ha! I can catch more fish,
even in the middle of a storm!

19:07.221 --> 19:08.785
Take that, McDuck Boat,

19:08.872 --> 19:11.221
which I'm just now realizing
was a metaphor

19:11.308 --> 19:13.431
for my hatred
of Scrooge McDuck!

19:13.518 --> 19:14.963
Why would
you do that?

19:15.050 --> 19:17.993
Because
I'm Flintheart Glomgold,

19:18.080 --> 19:20.486
and I always will be!

19:28.503 --> 19:30.344
Was that in his pocket
the whole time?

19:35.292 --> 19:39.112
Did you just steal
from children?

19:39.199 --> 19:41.353
That's not
my Duke Baloney.

19:42.032 --> 19:45.971
More like PhonyBaloney,
if you ask me.

19:46.058 --> 19:48.706
You stink!

19:48.910 --> 19:51.938
I left Duke Baloney behind
in South Africa.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.011
Long live Glomgold!

19:54.098 --> 19:56.867
Glomgold! Glomgold!

20:02.706 --> 20:05.807
It's just that dimes
are pretty pricey.

20:05.894 --> 20:08.712
You sure we can't go with
"Nickels for Newborns"?

20:08.799 --> 20:11.095
Mr. McDuck,
we've been over this.

20:11.182 --> 20:13.407
Glomgold! Glomgold!

20:13.494 --> 20:15.750
Glomgold!
Glomgold!

20:15.870 --> 20:18.938
Ha! You thought
you had me, Scrooge, huh?

20:19.025 --> 20:23.344
Pretending to be a boat
in my dreams? Nice try!

20:23.496 --> 20:26.104
Goodbye, Duke Baloney.

20:26.331 --> 20:28.781
Hello, Flinty.

20:28.871 --> 20:31.276
Mr. Glomgold,
I'm Zan Owlson,

20:31.363 --> 20:34.135
currently the acting CEO
of Glomgold Industries.

20:34.222 --> 20:35.790
- It's an honor to...
- Save it, Owl.

20:35.877 --> 20:39.180
Scrooge was hoping everyone would
forget Flintheart Glomgold.

20:39.285 --> 20:41.674
But I'm
unforgettable!

20:41.761 --> 20:44.493
You literally
forgot yourself!

20:44.580 --> 20:46.409
And you were happy.

20:46.496 --> 20:49.009
I'm only happy
when you're unhappy!

20:49.096 --> 20:51.906
Should I call security,
or...?

20:52.722 --> 20:54.938
It's best to just
let him yell.

20:55.025 --> 20:57.149
I will not be
forgotten again!

20:57.236 --> 21:00.776
I propose a wager...
You versus me.

21:00.863 --> 21:02.401
Whoever is
the richest duck

21:02.488 --> 21:04.298
by the by the end
of the year, wins.

21:04.385 --> 21:08.188
Come now, Flinty, why would I ever
agree to some ridiculous wager?

21:08.275 --> 21:11.531
Oh, I can think
of a reason.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.134
Where did you get that?

21:14.221 --> 21:16.002
Oh, this?

21:16.089 --> 21:18.391
I've had it since
I pilfered it from you

21:18.478 --> 21:20.424
as a wee child!

21:20.511 --> 21:21.924
That was you?!

21:22.011 --> 21:24.852
I beat you before,
and I can do it again.

21:24.939 --> 21:28.526
Unless you're afraid
of being second best.

21:28.613 --> 21:29.891
I'll never come in second

21:29.978 --> 21:32.024
to a vainglorious grifter
like you.

21:32.111 --> 21:33.619
Then prove it.

21:33.706 --> 21:36.338
Winner gets
the loser's company

21:36.425 --> 21:39.509
and becomes the richest duck
in the world...

21:39.596 --> 21:42.375
- forever!
- You're on!

21:45.787 --> 21:48.034
I'm just gonna go ahead

21:48.121 --> 21:50.259
and sign the charity paperwork
for the both of you.

21:50.346 --> 21:52.071
Pleasure doing business.

21:52.158 --> 21:54.712
Scrooge!
Glomgold's back! He's...

21:54.799 --> 21:56.627
Already here.

21:56.714 --> 21:59.446
Feels like we missed
something important.
