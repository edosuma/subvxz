First, your father left the

be taken care of always.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.942

03:50.944 --> 03:54.880

03:54.882 --> 03:58.550
Your father also left me in

04:00.354 --> 04:02.554

04:02.556 --> 04:07.025
- The company is Dad's legacy.
- It's too much to handle alone.

because of your father's... condition.

- He trusted me to do what's best...
- But maybe there's a way to keep...

04:42.663 --> 04:46.498
It was expensive and you barely had
it a week before you got paint on it,

04:46.500 --> 04:49.701
so I put it into the Goodwill
pile for Gunther to drop off.

04:49.703 --> 04:52.104

in anyone's hands after that.

04:52.106 --> 04:54.272

04:54.274 --> 04:57.075
Could that box of bells in the
shed have belonged to him?

I just thought it was your
father's creepy, old memorabilia,

05:03.484 --> 05:05.817

That's it.

07:54.621 --> 07:56.154
What do you expect me to do?

07:56.156 --> 07:58.056
You got to get Cam to
reconsider giving his DNA.

07:58.058 --> 07:59.424
I told you, it's a no.

07:59.426 --> 08:01.726

to shut all this down.

08:01.728 --> 08:03.328
Find another way.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.997
Fine, you can provide your own DNA.

08:05.999 --> 08:09.067
If there's no familial match, then
we know that Cam's in the clear.

08:09.069 --> 08:10.368
No, Brady, no.

08:10.370 --> 08:14.039
If my family is saying no, so am I.

08:17.977 --> 08:20.946
You don't need permission to
get a sample from your wife.

Dana, do me a favor, don't
eavesdrop on my phone calls, okay?

08:24.084 --> 08:27.452

happened to overhear.

08:27.454 --> 08:30.922
Different thing. Just saying.

08:30.924 --> 08:32.957
You live together.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.626
It's legal for you to take a
DNA sample from your own home.

08:35.629 --> 08:37.962
Now I know why you're divorced.

08:37.965 --> 08:40.198
Twice.

08:45.671 --> 08:49.474
He's unpredictable. I-I mean,
sometimes he's a normal kid.

08:49.476 --> 08:54.713
Other times it's like he's...
missing an empathy chip.

08:54.715 --> 08:59.851
He gave this weird speech
at my father's funeral.

08:59.853 --> 09:03.054
He tried to put his cousin in a cage.

09:03.056 --> 09:05.857
He... cut off a cat's tail.

09:05.859 --> 09:10.161
Not to hurt it, just to see
if the nerves would...

09:10.830 --> 09:11.896
regenerate.

09:11.898 --> 09:15.066
Um... you know, so we-we thought

09:15.068 --> 09:18.003
it would be a good idea for
him to see a professional.

09:18.005 --> 09:19.671
What would really help Jack is if

09:19.673 --> 09:21.539
his parents lived together

09:55.542 --> 09:58.476
This a consent form to
record the sessions?

09:58.478 --> 10:00.745
For liability purposes
because Jack is a minor.

10:00.747 --> 10:02.914
Did my mom have to sign
one of these for me?

10:02.916 --> 10:06.251
It's standard procedure
for underage clients.

10:06.253 --> 10:09.654
So... you recorded my sessions?

Yeah, you're not the only one.

10:28.108 --> 10:29.507
No, it's...

10:29.509 --> 10:34.679
Brady found a photo of me from back then
wearing a belt like the one they found

10:34.681 --> 10:37.882
in the Silver Bells murder
that he's investigating.

10:37.884 --> 10:43.755
If the police do some digging
and find those tapes,

10:43.757 --> 10:45.523
it wouldn't look good.

10:47.293 --> 10:49.427
So, what now?

10:51.464 --> 10:53.832
I have to destroy those tapes.

10:53.834 --> 10:57.068
TESSA: <i>Cam's innocent.</i>
I know you know that.

10:57.070 --> 11:02.307
It's just such a weird situation, but we
shouldn't let it get between us, right?

11:02.309 --> 11:05.577
- I mean, we're first.
- Yes, we are.

11:05.579 --> 11:08.346
Okay, I'm late to meet
Lesley for a drink.

11:08.348 --> 11:10.982

it done on the down-low.

11:56.352 --> 12:00.212
- How low we talking?
- Results can come to me and only me.

12:07.455 --> 12:09.522
NAOMI: Great to see you here, Tom.

12:09.524 --> 12:12.258
TOM: I have an idea on how
to win back the youth vote.

12:12.260 --> 12:16.495
One of my old hedge fund buddies,
he's launching a mobile gaming app.

12:16.497 --> 12:19.732
I can reach out, see if we can
get some sponsored content.

12:19.734 --> 12:22.702
70% of mobile gamers are under 18.

12:22.704 --> 12:26.439
We need voters... of voting age.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.942
I was thinking about Stephen Gostkowski.

12:29.944 --> 12:31.777
The kicker for the Patriots?

12:31.779 --> 12:33.746
His "Q" rating with the 18-to-25

12:33.748 --> 12:38.084
set is astronomical, and he just
met with a political consultant.

12:38.086 --> 12:41.087
He's considering running for office.

12:41.089 --> 12:42.588
And what better way to dip his toes

12:42.590 --> 12:44.490
in the political waters
than by endorsing you?

12:44.492 --> 12:45.624
I'd swing up three points, at least.

12:45.626 --> 12:46.892
Yeah, we just need a way to woo him.

12:46.894 --> 12:50.196
Well, he's wearing a charity bracelet
for the Boston Arts Education Program.

12:50.198 --> 12:52.098
- How do you...?
- Well, Tessa's on the board.

12:52.100 --> 12:55.000
Could you fast-track a
fund-raiser for the program?

12:55.002 --> 12:57.169
How's Friday night?

13:00.140 --> 13:02.041
Well, we'll need some Patriots gear

13:02.043 --> 13:04.143
around the house so
Stephen knows we're fans.

13:04.145 --> 13:06.812

29:40.677 --> 29:41.943
Hazard a guess.

29:41.945 --> 29:43.612
What do you want?

29:43.614 --> 29:45.380
Give up the Stephen
Gostkowski endorsement.

29:45.382 --> 29:47.983
Just tell him you're no longer
in the market for his support,

29:47.985 --> 29:50.552
'cause if he goes anywhere
near that podium tonight,

29:50.554 --> 29:53.088
these pictures will be
in tomorrow's paper.

30:01.631 --> 30:03.932
What is this?

30:03.934 --> 30:05.934
What the hell?

30:05.936 --> 30:07.962
You're breaking into
places to steal drugs now?

30:07.987 --> 30:08.637
What? No.

30:08.639 --> 30:10.805
- I wasn't there to steal drugs.
- Then why were you there?

30:10.807 --> 30:12.440
It's complicated.

30:12.442 --> 30:13.893
I left something there,
and I had to go get it.

30:13.917 --> 30:14.376
(SCOFFS)

30:14.378 --> 30:16.278
- You're lying.
- I'm not. Where'd you get this, anyway?

30:16.280 --> 30:18.880
- Are you having me followed?
- Conley's people took them.

30:18.882 --> 30:21.016
And if Stephen Gostkowski
endorses me tonight,

30:21.018 --> 30:22.484
he's going to take them to the press.

30:22.486 --> 30:24.519
You can't.

30:24.521 --> 30:27.188
They'll arrest me. I'll lose Jack.
You got to help me out.

30:27.190 --> 30:29.824
You did this to yourself. You.

30:29.826 --> 30:31.226
No, no, no, please.

30:31.228 --> 30:32.727
We're out of time, Alison.

30:32.729 --> 30:35.530
We have to get down there.

30:52.027 --> 30:53.799
Thank you all for coming here tonight.

30:53.824 --> 30:55.690
And thank you for your
generous contributions

30:55.715 --> 30:59.066
to the Boston Arts Education Program.

30:59.121 --> 31:01.331
At a time when teachers

31:01.356 --> 31:03.301
are forced to use test scores

31:03.326 --> 31:06.527
to assess the quality
of public education,

31:06.529 --> 31:09.697
it's more important than
ever that we defend

31:09.699 --> 31:12.032
our children's ability to create.

31:12.034 --> 31:14.735
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:14.737 --> 31:16.070
Now, we have some

31:16.072 --> 31:17.604
incredible people here tonight

31:17.606 --> 31:19.273
to support this cause.

31:26.114 --> 31:28.716
One of whom is

31:28.718 --> 31:30.317
Mayor Bill Conley.

31:32.721 --> 31:35.456
Come on up here, Bill.

31:38.893 --> 31:43.097
Mayor Conley and I just had
a private conversation,

31:43.099 --> 31:46.667
which I'd like to share.

31:51.673 --> 31:54.575
We just talked about the fact that

31:54.577 --> 31:56.310
despite our differences,

31:56.312 --> 31:59.046
we can reach across the aisle

31:59.048 --> 32:01.181
when it comes to our kids

32:01.183 --> 32:04.251
and their education,
especially in the arts.

32:04.253 --> 32:07.821
As the proud sister of
a professional artist,

32:07.823 --> 32:12.025
I've seen firsthand how
effective arts education

32:12.027 --> 32:16.263
can be in helping young
people forge successful,

32:16.265 --> 32:18.499
creative careers.

32:18.501 --> 32:21.135
(CROWD APPLAUDS)

32:21.137 --> 32:22.603
CAM: <i>Thank you, I-I promise you</i>

32:22.605 --> 32:24.571
I wasn't there to get drugs.

32:24.573 --> 32:26.073
Stop.

32:26.075 --> 32:28.342
How many times have you
promised no more drugs,

32:28.344 --> 32:31.979
you're better, it's
over, how many times?

32:31.981 --> 32:35.416
How much do the rest of
us have to sacrifice?

32:35.418 --> 32:37.418
That endorsement could have

32:37.420 --> 32:40.554
sealed the election for me.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.825
So, tell me what to do, Cam.

32:44.827 --> 32:47.327
Tell me...

32:47.329 --> 32:49.797
'cause you've been a mess
since you were a kid,

32:49.799 --> 32:52.466
and now Jack's following
in your footsteps, so

32:52.468 --> 32:54.301
what do we do?

32:56.137 --> 32:58.705
I've tried tough love,

32:58.707 --> 33:00.607
Tessa's tried coddling,

33:00.609 --> 33:03.544
Mom's tried shipping you
off to the most expensive

33:03.546 --> 33:05.612
rehab facility in this state.

33:05.614 --> 33:08.549
How do we fix you?

33:12.520 --> 33:14.621
Or is it just...

33:14.623 --> 33:17.257
not possible?

33:20.428 --> 33:22.996
You don't need to be fixed.

33:22.998 --> 33:25.666
Your family doesn't get you.

33:27.702 --> 33:29.736
I get you.

33:30.839 --> 33:34.608
You want to stay for a late night snack?

33:39.481 --> 33:42.282
What if I just stayed?

34:00.869 --> 34:02.603
Dang.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.338
Yeah?

34:04.340 --> 34:07.774
Oh, no, I said "dang," not Dana.

34:07.776 --> 34:09.243
Oh.

34:09.245 --> 34:10.944
My name's only one letter away.

34:10.946 --> 34:12.779
You know what else?

34:12.781 --> 34:16.683
It's also only one letter away from DNA.

34:16.685 --> 34:18.418
(CHUCKLES)

34:18.420 --> 34:19.920
This job is my destiny.

34:19.922 --> 34:21.420
Cool.

34:21.422 --> 34:23.422
I have news, by the way.

34:23.425 --> 34:25.626
The full report will take
a few days, but, uh,

34:25.628 --> 34:28.661
give you the headline.

34:35.637 --> 34:36.637
Hey, buddy.

34:36.639 --> 34:37.737
Hey.

34:37.739 --> 34:38.804
Can't sleep?

34:38.806 --> 34:40.908
I could, but it was boring.

34:40.909 --> 34:43.010
What are you watching?

34:43.012 --> 34:45.712
Something boring.

34:45.714 --> 34:47.214
Can I watch, too?

34:47.216 --> 34:49.416
Sure.

34:49.418 --> 34:51.752
Hey, so...

34:51.754 --> 34:54.420
what happened today at
the therapist's office?

34:55.723 --> 34:57.758
She didn't like my puppet.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.093
What puppet?

35:00.095 --> 35:02.930
I'll show you.

35:17.345 --> 35:20.013
Thanks, Phyllis.

35:20.015 --> 35:23.216
Now I have teeth.

(DOORBELL CHIMING)

35:31.026 --> 35:32.859
What the hell?

35:36.998 --> 35:39.199
We need to talk, Mrs. Hawthorne.

35:39.201 --> 35:40.634
Oh, well, whatever it is,

35:40.636 --> 35:42.402
I'm sure it can wait till tomorrow.

35:42.404 --> 35:43.804
No.

35:43.806 --> 35:46.506
It's about the Silver Bells case.

35:55.416 --> 35:57.250
- Give us a moment, please.
- Of course.

36:00.488 --> 36:02.255
All right, well,

36:02.257 --> 36:03.523
now that you've made a scene...

36:03.525 --> 36:04.658
That wasn't my intention.

36:04.660 --> 36:05.859
What do you want?

36:05.861 --> 36:07.160
The, uh,

36:07.162 --> 36:08.295
leather belt we pulled

36:08.297 --> 36:10.163
from the collapsed tunnel,

36:10.165 --> 36:12.065
the one we believe the
Silver Bells Killer

36:12.067 --> 36:13.734
used to strangle his last victim,

36:13.736 --> 36:15.068
turns out you purchased a belt

36:15.070 --> 36:16.970
just like it a month before the murder.

36:16.972 --> 36:18.772
BRADY: Detective Cutter.

36:18.774 --> 36:20.540
I am in the middle of
something, Detective Ross.

36:20.542 --> 36:22.476
This family is not connected to

36:22.478 --> 36:23.644
the Silver Bells killings.

36:23.646 --> 36:24.745
That is still to be determined.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.013
No, I tested their DNA

36:26.015 --> 36:27.748
and the report shows
no match to the belt.

36:28.983 --> 36:31.451
LINDA: So, I guess it's
just a coincidence

36:31.453 --> 36:33.553
that the type of belt you owned wound up

36:33.555 --> 36:35.756
in concrete made by your company.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.825
No, not a coincidence.

36:38.827 --> 36:42.763
One of my longtime household
staffers, Gunther Holzmann,

36:42.765 --> 36:46.366
had access to both the
belt and the work site,

36:46.368 --> 36:49.302
and as much as it hurts me to say so,

36:49.304 --> 36:50.904
I think you should look into him.

36:50.906 --> 36:52.039
And where is he?

36:52.041 --> 36:53.940
I terminated his employment yesterday,

36:53.942 --> 36:55.776
but I can give you his address.

36:57.745 --> 37:00.013
- Where did you get the sample?
- What?

37:00.015 --> 37:02.949
To test the DNA, you needed a sample.
Where did you get it?

37:02.951 --> 37:05.952
I-I-I took a hair from your hairbrush.

37:05.954 --> 37:07.254
What?

37:07.256 --> 37:08.855
Tess, technically, it's legal without

37:08.857 --> 37:09.990
your consent because
it's from our own home.

37:09.992 --> 37:11.358
"Technically legal"?

37:11.360 --> 37:12.726
I don't care if it's legal.

37:12.728 --> 37:13.760
I said no.

37:13.762 --> 37:15.262
No, Tess, I know, but...

37:15.264 --> 37:16.763
come on, you got to look at
the bigger picture here.

37:16.765 --> 37:18.131
I just exonerated your family.

37:18.133 --> 37:20.500
You betrayed my trust.

37:20.502 --> 37:22.202
We talked about this, we agreed,

37:22.204 --> 37:24.571
and then you went behind my back.

37:24.573 --> 37:26.773
Get out.

37:26.775 --> 37:28.308
What?

37:28.310 --> 37:30.777
I'm staying here tonight.

37:50.104 --> 37:51.203

37:51.205 --> 37:54.307
Business trip, Moscow, back Thursday.

37:56.410 --> 37:57.710
It was you.

37:57.712 --> 38:00.413
You bought Hawthorne Concrete.

38:00.415 --> 38:02.870
Well, technically,
Darcolo Industries did,

38:02.972 --> 38:05.039
but I will be running it.

38:06.581 --> 38:08.415
I love you, Ali,

38:08.417 --> 38:10.818

everything managed...</i>

38:22.800 --> 38:26.502
but now I just...

38:27.378 --> 38:29.880
I feel powerless.

38:29.882 --> 38:32.151
My marriage, my campaign...

38:32.206 --> 38:35.371
Alison, in one night
you saved your brother

38:35.396 --> 38:37.697
from a probable arrest,

38:37.699 --> 38:40.833
you raised $60,000 in arts education,

38:40.835 --> 38:43.136
and you looked killer in that dress.

38:43.138 --> 38:44.770
(LAUGHS)

38:44.772 --> 38:46.839
You think?

38:48.575 --> 38:50.343
I do.

39:16.570 --> 39:18.437
You orchestrated this whole thing

39:18.439 --> 39:19.705
with Molly.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.111
Why?

39:26.346 --> 39:27.747
I wanted to show you

39:27.749 --> 39:29.949
what's good about this life

39:29.951 --> 39:32.985
so you wouldn't want to destroy it.

39:32.987 --> 39:35.688
It almost worked.

39:37.291 --> 39:40.326
Still could.

39:40.328 --> 39:43.129
I want you to be happy.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.032
You want my silence.

39:46.034 --> 39:48.634
Can't I want both?

39:52.306 --> 39:53.639
Garrett.

39:55.209 --> 39:57.310
You need to make peace
with the past in a way

39:57.312 --> 39:59.312
that's not destructive.

40:05.352 --> 40:08.854
I don't know if I can.

40:28.842 --> 40:31.410
(GRUNTS)

40:39.786 --> 40:41.787
And you did this chopping carrots?

40:41.789 --> 40:44.657
Mm-hmm.

40:44.659 --> 40:47.493
Maybe get the bag of
baby carrots next time.

40:47.495 --> 40:49.729
Hmm...

40:49.731 --> 40:51.097
a good idea.

40:51.099 --> 40:53.645
I'm lucky this place was nearby.

40:54.559 --> 40:55.801
You live around here?

40:57.192 --> 40:58.450
Yeah, pretty close.

40:58.731 --> 41:00.130
You?

41:00.132 --> 41:02.199
Not far.

41:02.201 --> 41:05.502
I feel like, uh...

41:05.504 --> 41:08.238
I feel like I've seen you before.

41:09.941 --> 41:12.743
Yeah, maybe the news.

41:12.745 --> 41:15.979
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:17.515 --> 41:19.216
Your father...

41:21.419 --> 41:23.186
Yeah, my father was

41:23.188 --> 41:25.455
a victim of the Silver Bells Killer...

41:27.191 --> 41:30.660
...but they're closing in
on the guy now, finally.

41:34.399 --> 41:36.266
That is good news.

me out, honestly.
