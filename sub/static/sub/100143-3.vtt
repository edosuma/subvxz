WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
May the Gods speak!

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
The true battle...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
..does not always unfold
upon the field.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Sometimes,
it is the one man you need to fear.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
The one who can scare the dead...

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Tear down temples...

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Shift the pillars of time.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
That's where the true danger lies.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
The Betwixt must fast for two moons
between each journey,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
only then will she receive
the great vision.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Have you received any great visions?
Any visions at all?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
No? But, hey, no pressure.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh, my sister,
I wish I had half your strength,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
but I won't let you down, I promise.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
For I truly know now
that there is a light in this world.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
There is a light.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
My name is Harka.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And how exactly do you fit
into all this?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I am all of this.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
In the beginning,
there were the brothers.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
The first and the second man.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Veran! Veran, where are you?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
The Gods allowed the brothers
to play in their garden.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Veran.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
-The eldest, Harka...
-Where have you gone?

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
was destined to lead
all children of the Gods.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
One, two, three, four...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
..five, six.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
The first, Harka, had to learn
of the Wonder.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
The Gods left fruits
to see their garden as it truly is.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Sometimes I feel
I'm not strong enough.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Strong enough for the Wonder.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
The Gods saw and heard everything.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
When I look out my window

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Many sights to see

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
And when I look in my window

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
So many different people to be

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh, no

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Must be the season of the witch

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Must be the season of the witch, yeah

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Must be the season of the witch

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
You got to pick up every stitch

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
The rabbits running in the ditch

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Beatnicks are out to make it rich

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
We must pay our respects to Veran.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
That fiend is many things.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
He is not the Veran.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
I pray to the Aura for the coming day.
I thank you for all it may bring.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Hear me, Mars.
Make me strong this day.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
I pray to you Pino
that you protect my feet,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
that all day long, my boot stays on.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
That the leather doesn't fray
or the buckle snap.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
..shield of war. Blessed are thou
for thy conquering purposes.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
..sacred feast.
Accept this wine I place before you.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Do not slight me for my slight.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
-General Aulus, come quickly.
-I'm busy.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
General, a queen is at the gates.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Which one is she? The stumpy one?
The one with the log

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
-or the bald one having a fit?
-The bald one.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
-She's a queen?
-Aye, sir.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
-What's your name?
-Felix.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Well, Felix, let's say we go
and nip this in the bud, eh?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Good morning, most noble queen.
On behalf of the emperor...

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Hark the howling of our dead!

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
They bring a warning.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Leave this place, Demon,
or face our wrath.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
On behalf of the emperor,
I welcome you...

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
-I shit on your emperor!
-Now you're just being rude.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I appreciate the visit,
I have lots to do

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
and you've clearly had a big night...

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
You make sacrifices of our people.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
In these woods.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
You leave unburied souls
to rot in this world.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
You must pay.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
You desecrate our dead.
Leave now, demon,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
or you will pay.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Well, I can see you're upset.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Let me introduce you to Felix.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
It was his idea to invade your country.
We just came along to help.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I'll leave it to him to explain.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
-Felix?
-What?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Guards!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
We'll be back, and we'll bring
our brothers and sisters

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
to burn this place down!

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Oh, I look forward to that.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
She was right.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
-Who was?
-The crazy old queen.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
There are bodies in the forest.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Many children, girls,
slain and left to rot.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
What makes you think
that's anything to do with us?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Because I watched it happen.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
You don't have to answer.
I'm not shocked.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm sure there's a good explanation.
I just don't know it.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
We lie awake and shake like leaves

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Upon the green and haunted trees

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
And listen to our knocking knees

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
The smell of bodies on the breeze

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
The smell of bodies on the breeze

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Do you know what a messiah is?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Why don't you tell me?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I've met quite a few.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Persia, Canaan, Athens.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
They all have one thing in common.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
They're all so certain.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Certain of their truth.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Of the sanctity of their mission.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Some are just madmen or women.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
But some are dangerous.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Very dangerous.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So you need to find that girl.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Before he does.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
You mean Veran?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Veran is finished.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
He's living on borrowed time.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, if it's not Veran, then who?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Hello, it's all right.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You're hunting?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
-What you after?
-Rabbits.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
-Your family?
-They're dead.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
The Romans came.
They burned our village.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
That's a good spear.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
-This is a good spot.
-Why are you here?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I have to go now.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Good luck.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
You worked hard to know our ways.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
There's so much left to learn.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
You were a warrior once,
fought many battles.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Your queen prized you.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
It was a long time ago.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You'll be a warrior again.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
But to serve the Gods,
you must first give up your child.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
He'll be safe with one
of the other tribes.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Can... can he not stay in our tribe?

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Your path must be clear.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
You will not see your son again.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Is your path clear?

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
-I'm not hungry.
-Oh. They took such a long time to grow.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I grew them for you specially.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
There.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Last night you dreamed of her.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
-Who?
-Your sister.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
-How'd you know that?
-Because you cried out in your sleep.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
-Why do you think she came for you?
-It was a coincidence.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
-Coincidence.
-Maybe she came back to punish me.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And I wouldn't blame her.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Tell me your dream.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
I dreamt the last time I saw her.
The last time we spoke.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
My father had been sacrificed.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
I marked the occasion by accusing her
of betraying our father, betraying me,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
of taking my place.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I said terrible things.
Things I can never take back.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
-Well, you were you blind with grief.
-I abandoned her and now she's dead.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Who the fuck am I?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And who the fuck are you?

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
And what the fuck do you want
with a lost, confused, stupid...

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Look at me! I don't know
if I want a shit or a haircut.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Was your love for your sister
half-hearted?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And what on earth good
did that ever do?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I know what it's like to mourn blood.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Many years ago I had a brother.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Where have you been?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
You've been gone since the spring.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
I loved him more than I loved
the rivers.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
-What's that?
-I don't know.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
More than the stars,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
and I trusted him
more than I trusted myself.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Have you seen the apples?
The apples are back.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm hungry. Bring me an apple.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
A good one, mind. The best.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
And he used that trust to destroy me.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
To take my place.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Hello, friend. Here.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Harka! No, Harka!

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
-You tricked me. Why?
-Harka!

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
Just as I was destroyed so were you.
By the same force.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
That's why you are here.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
He who wronged you, wronged me.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
They are the same.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
-What's his name?
-His name is Phelan.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Your sacrifice proves your faith.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
The time has come

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
-Are you ready to fight?
-I am.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Listen very carefully.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
This day, I will be betrayed.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
The Druids will split asunder.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
When it happens, which way will you go?

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
With you, Veran. Always.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Here's what I want you to do.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Do you know what the runes say?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Nobody knows except Veran.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I know.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Well, don't you want to know?

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
You a bit curious?
Nervous, but curious? Come on.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
-Yes.
-Well, then, let's see.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Oh, yes.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
This was Veran. Pure Veran.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
This is so good, it's almost funny.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
What does it say?

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
It says, "I'm not a queen,
but a sacrifice."

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
-Veran wrote that?
-Upon your sister.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Your blood. Veran.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
My brother.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Brearn, I beseech you.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
We must pay our respects.
-No.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Think, Brearn.
Grief has poisoned your soul.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
The age is poisoned.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
-And there... there is the poisoner.
-Brearn, no.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
This fiend.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
This devil, this...
This is Rome's whore.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
-You challenge me?
-And see more sorcery?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
No.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Sisters. Brothers.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
The road ahead splits two ways.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
Walk with Veran
and you walk blind into the abyss.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
This day, I lead another path.
The path to the first man.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Harka is risen! We will go to him.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
We will find the Dead Man.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
-Dead Man! Dead Man!
-Dead Man.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
The Dead Man has risen!
I serve the Dead Man!

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
A pretty rosebush in our yard

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
And behind that bush
Stands a lad right hard

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
And a lass by his side...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Nice ditty.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Somewhat base subject,
but the men enjoy that.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
They like their tunes to reek
of sex and death.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Notice anything strange?

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
No Gods. No effigies of those
who watch over us.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
How does he given supplication,
I wonder?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
You must have seen him pray.
Who does he favor?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
-Mars? Jupiter?
-I don't even know the difference.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
-Aren't we both Roman now?
-I'll eat your food...

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
-I'll drink your wine...
-Count our silver?

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
-Happily.
-But, erm, and no offense here.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Your poxy Gods can go
and fuck themselves.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
-I like you.
-No, you don't.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
We Romans, true Romans,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
we like everything ordered.
We like to know what's what.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Straight roads, straight thinking.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
This island is full of dark diversions.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I'm here to make sure no one gets lost.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
You see, I represent the true Rome.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
The Pantheon, Emperor, Senate.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
The one you and the general
swore allegiance to, Queen Amena.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
That is who you serve now, is it not?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Mate, your face rings a bell.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
My shoes rings a bell.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
-You were in Egypt?
-It's true.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
I follow the empire like
a blue bottle follows a cow's arse.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I was with the ninth in Pannonia

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
when half of you were mere glints
in your neighbor's eyes.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
There was in the legion at that time
young praefectus.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
What was his name?

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Lucius something...

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Lucius Validus.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
That's the one.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
Many in Rome look at the general,
and they see the future.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Is that what you see?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
What do you see when you look at me?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I shall let the general know
you dropped by.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
I'm sure he'll be as intrigued
by your line of questioning.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
The emperor was...
very impressed with you.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
I'd like him to be able to maintain
that good impression.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
So...

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
..if there's any information.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Anything concerning the general's plans.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Anything perhaps to do with...

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
...what happened out in the woods.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm sure the emperor can rely on you
to pass it on.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
He was the general's most trusted ally.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Then one day,
he just disappeared into thin air.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
-And no one knows where he went?
-No one.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Strange.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Well, I must be strolling.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
It remains for me to pass the hut.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
There was a maid, so I've been told

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
She had no name, she had no home

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
Yet by herself and all alone

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
She brought down all the Gods of Rome

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
She brought down all the Gods of Rome

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Who goes there?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Who goes?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Show yourself!

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
You took your time.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
Voices... There's voices
coming from the earth. Listen.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Listen! I swear.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
This is haunted ground.
We shouldn't be here.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
All I hear is you gibbering.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
-We should tell the praefectus.
-Tell him what?

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Sir, we're under siege
from the unquiet souls of the dead.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm going to die here. I can feel it.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
Hey, pull yourself together, mate.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Oh, mercy.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Oh, bollocks.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
How many are there?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
The only one we got so far, sir.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
The rest just... just vanished.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Like ghosts.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Ghosts don't need sewers
to get in and out of, do they?

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
Your father Pellenor, did you love him?

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Sorry, forgive me.
I'm obsessed with love.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I think about love all the time.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I had love once. Perfect love.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
I believe if you really want
to destroy something,

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
you don't use a sword or an arrow,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
you use love, no?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
It's a much stronger subject.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Your father, did he expect you
to follow him?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
To become king yourself?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Veran disagreed.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
Would you be free of Veran's web,
Son of Pellenor?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Why can't the Holy Dell
be near the reed beds?

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
The Holy Dell is only holy
because it has remained a secret.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Many Druids have studied here.
It's protected by the Gods.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
We could always fly.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Sir, he says he know where they are.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
To be clear, it wasn't my idea
to give you the call.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
-If it was up to me... This way.
-Where is he?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
It's probably bollocks.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
No one knows where the camp is
but my brother.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
He works the reed beds
down the river mouth.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
He says every full moon, the girlie and
warlock go there and they dance about.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
-They never miss a month.
-Where are these reeds beds?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
This is a good spot.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Give me the sickle.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
The moon isn't full.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
-Yes, it is.
-Oh, you know better?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
-Should I just go? You've got this?
-It's full.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Wait.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
-Fucking freezing.
-Wait.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Waiting.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
-And now, it's full, so...
-Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Pass the...

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Can you?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Thank you.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Begin.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
What's the next part?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
-What?
-For the prophecy?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
You said when I pass through air,
you'd tell me the next bit.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It can wait till morning.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
What about our legions of the dead?

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
"The maiden will waiver on the path
and fall into the arms of the eagle."

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Eagles don't have arms.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
You got a problem,
take it up with the Gods.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
-Tell me. I'm listening.
-Then fuckin' listen.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
"The maiden will waiver on the path
and fall into the arms of the eagle.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Only the eagle can show her
the true path to the Lake of Tears.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
At the Lake of Tears,
she will be reborn."

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
"Reborn?"

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
-Or forborne.
-What?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
-What?
-What?

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
I just told you, "At the Lake of Tears,
she will be reborn...

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
-..or forborne."
-Well, which is it?

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
How come you don't know?
Were you actually listening?

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Oh, I listened.
But you didn't want to clear that up?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Don't know which it is?

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
My guts were hanging out on the floor,
I'd lost about six flagons of blood,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
and Veran speaks
in that funny, croaky voice.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
What does "forborne" mean?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Basically, the same as we're born.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
What does "forborne" mean?
What does it exactly mean?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Sacrificed.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
-Excuse me?
-Yeah. You heard me.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
"Sacrificed."

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Look, these prophecies,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
the language they use,
they're ambiguous.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
-"Sacrificed."
-The wording can't be taken literally.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
For instance, eagles don't have arms.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
-What is it...
-Shh.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
We are surrounded.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
What do we do? I can't run.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Fell out of the fucking sky...

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Here.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Remember Toba, the wounded fox?

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
"Toba almighty, help me escape
the jaws which would devour me."

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I'll draw them away.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
Ready? Together.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
The girl! Get the girl! Get the...

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Where is she?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Here! Over here!

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Oh, shit.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
Spread out! They can't escape.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Easy child. I won't hurt you.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
That's it. Stay still.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
North of here lies a village...

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
..at the mouth of the river
beneath the rock of the crow.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
The fisherman who lives there
has three sons. All fair.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Bring them to me.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Come along.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
-How did they find us?
-They probably followed your smell.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Everything was inside there.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
My herbs, potions, poultices,
extracts, grasses, bones, relics.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Big Pebble was in there.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
You always carry Big Pebble.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
You never let Big Pebble
out of your sight.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
All right, everything except Big Pebble.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
It's too dangerous here now.
We must move far away.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
-The work of 20 moons!
-We can start again.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
It's just herbs and grasses.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
We can gather them again
and make new offerings.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
All is not lost.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
What are you doing? I can't.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Eat it. You may as well.
You're right. All is not lost.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
You know tricks.
You'll make a good illusionist.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
Go from town to town, make the children
gasp with your amazing powers.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
But there won't be a town or children,

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
because the world will have ended
because of you.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
So, come on. Fill your stupid belly.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
-I await the great vision.
-Eat.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
-I await the great vision!
-I don't believe you!

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
What do I do, Big Pebble?
Tell me, please.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Because until she's prepared
to surrender to this,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
to really surrender with all her soul...

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
..we're wasting our time.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Twenty moons of the smock.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
She's good, but is she good enough
to defeat the Romans?

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
Now, we've lost too much time.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Too much.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
We've lost...

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
We've lost.
