01:52.960 --> 01:54.220
[teacher] Alright troops!

01:54.221 --> 01:55.480
In just a few short hours

01:55.520 --> 01:56.700
we'll be pitching tents

01:56.701 --> 01:57.880
in the great outdoors.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.200
Uh, Violetta, don't you think

02:05.240 --> 02:06.680
you're traveling

02:06.681 --> 02:08.120
just a bit light?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.919
- I've got everything
- I need right here.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.100
You think

02:28.101 --> 02:29.200
I should've brought more?

02:33.560 --> 02:34.700
Where's Vincent?

02:34.701 --> 02:35.840
Shouldn't he be here?

02:35.880 --> 02:37.080
Oh, he already left

02:37.081 --> 02:38.280
on the other bus.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.920
I just hope he's prepared.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.500
I mean, he doesn't seem

02:41.501 --> 02:43.040
like he'd be too used to

02:43.080 --> 02:44.120
'roughing it'.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.060
You haven't even

02:58.061 --> 02:59.400
got your tent up yet!

02:59.440 --> 03:01.120
I don't need a tent.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.680
I can sleep under the stars.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.280
Become one with the galaxy.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.520
Couldn't put it up?

03:05.560 --> 03:06.880
Didn't know we had to bring one.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.240
They really should've told us.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.040
Well... If it starts to rain

03:10.080 --> 03:11.340
our tent has a little awning

03:11.341 --> 03:12.600
you can sleep under.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.240
It'll keep at least half of you

03:14.241 --> 03:15.840
partially dry.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.840
- Yeah... Gonna get
- some more wood.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.200
This spot will have to do.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.160
- Just get all this other stuff
- out of the way.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.240
- Hey! We've got
- this spot already!

03:29.280 --> 03:31.240
- And thank you
- for saving it for me.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.400
Go away, this spot is ours.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.400
Somebody move these sticks.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.560
And get some plants

03:39.561 --> 03:40.681
in here that don't have that

03:40.720 --> 03:42.360
"real plant" smell.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.800
Hey! You're ruining everything!

03:47.840 --> 03:49.720
Does anybody hear anything?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.376
- For a moment
- I thought I heard someone

03:51.400 --> 03:53.440
Who used to be my friend.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.040
[teacher] Alright, so you guys

03:56.080 --> 03:57.520
are in Group C.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.880
Us? Mhmm...

03:58.920 --> 04:01.080
All of us?

04:01.120 --> 04:03.000
Nn... no, we're not together.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.360
But they do keep trying

04:04.361 --> 04:05.680
to steal our firewood.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.200
Here's your chore list

04:07.240 --> 04:08.800
and I expect everybody's name

04:08.840 --> 04:10.120
on at least one chore.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.200
Co-operation. Got it?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.019
Alright, Violetta.

04:16.021 --> 04:17.160
We're stuck with each other.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.839
Take your pick.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.920
Find a natural water source.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.120
Found one.

04:27.121 --> 04:28.640
Straight from a natural spring.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.600
Okay, no. Doesn't count.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.440
- What about setting up
- a garbage area?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.160
As if.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.560
[sighs] Gather firewood.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.400
Splinters.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.640
Start a fire.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.000
- That sounds easy.
- I'll do that one.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.200
Perfect.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.560
Oh, one little thing...

04:55.600 --> 04:56.640
it says you can't use

04:56.641 --> 04:57.680
a lighter or matches.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.200
Is it on fire yet?

05:16.560 --> 05:18.120
I think I smell smoke!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.780
Ugh. Somebody un-manicured

05:21.781 --> 05:23.440
is going to have to do this.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.780
That's okay. I'll just tell

05:24.781 --> 05:26.080
the teacher you couldn't do it.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.840
Uff...

05:35.760 --> 05:36.840
Uhm, I'm gonna go

05:36.841 --> 05:37.920
get a sweatshirt.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.120
Hi Mia. Say your password.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.500
"Look near water,

06:04.501 --> 06:05.840
find what is lost,

06:05.880 --> 06:08.360
keep safe Onchao at any cost."

06:19.760 --> 06:22.360
[screams]

06:24.560 --> 06:26.520
WHOA!

06:30.200 --> 06:31.240
[Mia] Ugh!

06:32.720 --> 06:33.780
- Where's Onchao?!

06:33.781 --> 06:34.840
- Huh?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.080
Oh hi, Mia.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.560
I didn't hear you coming in.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.840
Onchao's right there,

06:38.880 --> 06:40.000
playing with his friends.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.080
[neigh]

06:47.280 --> 06:49.200
- You guys are watching him,
- right?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.260
No, we're sitting here because

06:51.261 --> 06:53.280
prickle grass feels good.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.040
Hey, it actually kind of does.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.280
Onchao!

06:57.320 --> 07:00.120
Onchao! Come here!

07:01.080 --> 07:03.800
[neighs]

07:03.840 --> 07:05.080
Onchao!

07:09.920 --> 07:11.080
Are you okay?!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.856
- You're sure you're okay, right?
- Nothing broken?

07:16.880 --> 07:18.080
[snorts]

07:18.120 --> 07:19.320
[Yuko] What's up with you?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.320
Yeah. He was only playing.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.760
Well no more playing today.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.360
The oracles are never wrong.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.040
I'm gonna keep you safe.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.160
Safe from what?

07:28.200 --> 07:30.120
Yeah, there's no muncs around.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.080
Guh! Is that all there is?

08:02.200 --> 08:03.240
Meow.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.080
Ugh! My face!

08:07.120 --> 08:09.360
It's so hideous, the ugly

08:09.361 --> 08:11.600
is seeping through my mask.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.080
Ugh!

08:13.120 --> 08:14.160
GARGONA!

08:15.480 --> 08:16.480
- AAGH!

08:16.481 --> 08:17.481
- Don't look at me!

08:17.520 --> 08:18.680
Look that way!

08:18.720 --> 08:20.320
I'm withering away

08:20.360 --> 08:22.200
with every passing second.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.680
You have to do something.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.660
And not something temporary

08:26.661 --> 08:28.600
like these puny unicorn horns!

08:28.640 --> 08:30.000
- Something that lasts!

08:30.001 --> 08:31.360
- But my queen...

08:31.400 --> 08:34.400
I SAID DON'T LOOK AT ME! Hhhg!

08:34.440 --> 08:36.679
There is that young unicorn...

08:36.720 --> 08:38.460
I can't hear you when you

08:38.461 --> 08:40.200
talk away from me like that.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.760
DON'T LOOK AT ME!

08:42.799 --> 08:44.880
The young unicorn, my Queen.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.960
Its golden horn could wield

08:46.961 --> 08:49.000
more power than the others.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.320
Then bring it to me! Today!

08:51.360 --> 08:52.960
Do whatever it takes!

08:54.800 --> 08:56.040
Ugh!

08:59.920 --> 09:01.140
[Mo] So, run that Oracle

09:01.141 --> 09:02.360
by us again.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.100
"Keep safe young Onchao

09:04.101 --> 09:05.800
at all costs."

09:05.840 --> 09:07.560
- That fruit's not poisonous,
- is it?

09:07.600 --> 09:08.780
[laughs] Yeah.

09:08.781 --> 09:09.960
Apples are deadly.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.640
But what about the other part.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.040
What did you say it was?

09:13.080 --> 09:14.480
"Look near water,

09:14.520 --> 09:16.320
find what is lost"?

09:16.360 --> 09:17.540
That's gotta be talking about

09:17.541 --> 09:18.720
a piece of the trumptus.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.420
[Mia] Maybe the two things

09:22.421 --> 09:23.840
are related.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.720
The oracle must be saying Onchao

09:25.760 --> 09:26.840
will be safe at

09:26.841 --> 09:27.920
his favourite waterfall!

09:27.960 --> 09:29.480
[neighs]

09:29.520 --> 09:31.320
- [Yuko] Onchao's waterfall!
- Of course!

09:31.360 --> 09:33.600
- And there must be
- a piece of the Trumptus there!

09:33.640 --> 09:36.160
Either way, let's go already!

09:36.200 --> 09:38.160
- Come on, Onchao.
- We're going someplace

09:38.200 --> 09:39.920
You'll be completely safe!

09:52.480 --> 09:53.640
[Gargona] That's it.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.480
Pour it into the mold!

10:04.400 --> 10:05.680
[Panthea] Ugh!

10:05.681 --> 10:06.960
If this is another of your

10:07.000 --> 10:09.560
lame-brained failures, Gargona,

10:09.600 --> 10:11.120
I'll have you brushing

10:11.121 --> 10:12.640
the dragon's teeth for a week!

10:14.480 --> 10:16.060
This plan cannot fail,

10:16.061 --> 10:17.640
your highness.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.160
The golden-horned unicorn

10:19.161 --> 10:20.640
is young.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.920
And what does every young thing

10:22.960 --> 10:24.920
want more than anything

10:24.921 --> 10:26.880
in the whole wide world?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.080
[Panthea] I don't know, Gargona.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.040
Enlighten me.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.320
[Gargona] A friend.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.560
For once, Gargona,

10:35.561 --> 10:36.880
I feel you may be onto something

10:36.920 --> 10:38.600
not completely foolish.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.080
Thank you, queen Panthea.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.740
[Gargona] Those smart laic elves

10:42.741 --> 10:44.360
have no idea

10:44.400 --> 10:46.680
what's in store for them.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.680
- [Mia] I have a bad feeling,
- guys,

10:50.720 --> 10:51.820
We should keep

10:51.821 --> 10:52.920
an extra eye out for Muncs.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.160
Relax!

10:54.200 --> 10:55.960
There are no Muncs around.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.520
Don't speak too soon.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.240
- They might be
- after Onchao's friends!

11:02.280 --> 11:03.740
We better go investigate.

11:03.741 --> 11:05.200
No time to lose!

11:05.240 --> 11:06.920
What about Onchao?!

11:06.960 --> 11:08.400
- You go with him
- to the waterfall.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.800
We'll be right there!

11:11.120 --> 11:12.920
So much for staying together.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.360
[neighs]

11:24.400 --> 11:25.640
I know that look.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.880
So where's the Trumptus piece?

11:29.160 --> 11:30.400
Am I getting warm?

11:30.440 --> 11:31.840
[neighs]

11:31.880 --> 11:33.040
Warm.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.080
How about now? Am I warmer?

11:36.120 --> 11:37.280
[neighs]

11:37.320 --> 11:38.360
Warmer? Okay!

11:38.400 --> 11:39.520
How about now?

11:39.560 --> 11:41.520
[neighs loudly]

11:41.560 --> 11:42.600
Colder?

11:44.320 --> 11:45.380
You don't know how to play

11:45.381 --> 11:46.440
"hot or colder", do you?

11:47.720 --> 11:50.000
Okay, why don't you just point?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.300
I swear that munc patrol

11:55.301 --> 11:56.520
was right here!

11:56.560 --> 11:58.120
Yep. They were.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.360
[Yuko] A unicorn trap.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.600
Yuko, no, wait...!

12:06.640 --> 12:07.860
[Yuko] What? It's just

12:07.861 --> 12:09.080
a dumb munc trap.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.920
Oh... That was actually

12:12.921 --> 12:14.320
kind of clever.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.840
[Mo] Great.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.216
- Come down here
- and fight like Elves,

12:20.240 --> 12:21.320
You big cowards!

12:23.920 --> 12:25.320
Wow. I should shake my fist

12:25.321 --> 12:26.720
at them more often.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.920
They're headed right

12:27.921 --> 12:29.080
towards the waterfall!

12:29.120 --> 12:30.920
- They just wanted to
- get us out of the way!

12:30.960 --> 12:32.720
We have to warn Mia.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.840
I hope Mia gets

12:33.841 --> 12:34.920
the message in time!

12:37.440 --> 12:38.940
I don't get it.

12:38.941 --> 12:40.440
Where could it be?

12:40.480 --> 12:42.360
Uh oh...

12:42.400 --> 12:44.120
Mo and Yuko are calling.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.000
- That either means
- something's wrong, or...

12:46.040 --> 12:47.720
or something's really wrong.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.000
[neighs]

12:49.040 --> 12:50.720
No, you can't go help them.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.480
You have to stay safe today.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.640
[growling]

12:55.680 --> 12:57.480
[gasps] Muncs!

12:59.720 --> 13:01.040
Onchao... over here.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.360
This is perfect.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.160
- No Munc will ever
- come near this water.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.560
You'll be safe here, okay?

13:07.600 --> 13:08.640
[neighs]

13:16.400 --> 13:17.620
Promise me you won't come out

13:22.560 --> 13:23.640
DING!

13:23.680 --> 13:25.120
Take me to Yuko and Mo.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.680
What's taking Mia so long?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.040
Never mind that now,

13:42.041 --> 13:43.360
just keep digging.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.920
Hoooy...

13:46.921 --> 13:48.400
flying sure is exhausting.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.040
I need to rest.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.160
Aagh!

13:52.720 --> 13:54.520
I know, I know.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.120
[gasping] Just... Gotta...

13:57.160 --> 13:58.800
catch my breath.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.480
[gasps]

14:00.520 --> 14:02.760
Okay. Not much further.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.320
Perfection!

14:07.360 --> 14:09.140
They've left the unicorn

14:09.141 --> 14:10.920
completely alone!

14:10.960 --> 14:13.480
Straight to the waterfall!

Sorry I took so long.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.400
What happened here?

14:54.440 --> 14:55.640
Where's Onchao?

14:55.680 --> 14:56.960
I left him at the waterfall.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.176
- You left him?!
- You left him?!

14:58.200 --> 14:59.280
I didn't want to bring him

14:59.320 --> 15:00.560
near the Munc patrol.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.280
But the Muncs are going there!

15:02.320 --> 15:04.056
- Didn't you pass the Muncs
- on your way here?

15:04.080 --> 15:05.580
I had to touch down

15:05.581 --> 15:07.080
for a rest once or twice!

15:07.120 --> 15:08.180
They must have

15:08.181 --> 15:09.240
gone right past me!

15:09.280 --> 15:10.720
Oh no, Onchao!

15:12.000 --> 15:13.160

- Hurry, Mia. You have to
- get back to Onchao!

15:22.720 --> 15:24.240
Here, take some extra water!

15:24.280 --> 15:25.920
You might need it.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.640
- What about you?
- We'll join you

15:27.680 --> 15:29.200
- As soon as

15:56.801 --> 15:58.080
jump him too soon,

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
he'll run back

15:59.121 --> 16:00.121
behind the waterfall

16:00.160 --> 16:02.120

around here for something!

You shall have a promotion!

And perhaps a chair

20:47.641 --> 20:48.960
to sit on! And...

- Ooouh!
- Ooouh!

You knuckle head!

20:56.440 --> 20:58.440
B-b-b-ut I-I-I...!

20:58.480 --> 21:01.280
I believe the dragons' teeth

21:01.281 --> 21:04.080
need cleaning, don't they?

21:04.120 --> 21:06.440
But the dragons hate

21:06.441 --> 21:08.760
having their teeth cleaned.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.160
[Panthea] (CHUCKLES) Yes.

to Gargona?

[all laugh]

21:31.800 --> 21:33.480
It's not all bad.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.216

- the statue as a doorstop?

21:35.240 --> 21:36.440
[laugh]

21:36.480 --> 21:38.760
Ohhh, that is true justice.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.320
And the best part, we found

21:40.321 --> 21:41.840
another piece of the trumptus.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.220
You really are becoming

Well, it's been an exciting day.

That's it! I don't care anymore!

Violetta?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.620
This is the stick

you were using?

22:49.680 --> 22:51.200
Yeah. So?

22:51.240 --> 22:52.880
It's plastic!

- Well you don't think
- I'd touch real sticks, do you?
