WEBVTT

00:05.060 --> 00:08.270
<i>"Selina Meyer didn't just
shatter the glass ceiling,"</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:10.320
she swept up every single shard

00:10.360 --> 00:12.190
so that my daughter
and your daughters

00:12.240 --> 00:14.360
"will never even know
it existed."

00:14.450 --> 00:18.410
Aw! - Well, that just
tickles my twat!

00:18.450 --> 00:20.450
<i>Gosh, Montez is
actually gonna say that</i>

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
at my portrait unveiling
in English?

00:22.540 --> 00:25.750
Yeah, in front of 200 of
Washington's most important people.

00:25.790 --> 00:29.040
- And Mike.
- See, Mike? That is good writing.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.420
- Why can't you write like that?
- I'm the first to admit

00:31.470 --> 00:33.800
I'm not the world's
greatest speech writer.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.713
Ma'am, the White House wants
us to finalize your guest list

00:35.720 --> 00:38.470
by the day after...
yesterday.

00:38.510 --> 00:41.810
- So, today. That's a bit of a brain twister.
- It's a hot ticket.

00:41.850 --> 00:43.140
What about
Congressman Jonah Ryan?

00:47.440 --> 00:51.020
Richard, you have
such a good sense of humor.

00:51.070 --> 00:53.150
- Amy, you should take a cue
from him, really. <i>Ma'am?</i>

00:53.200 --> 00:55.360
- <i>Yes. Oh!</i>
- Greg Morehouse is here for our meeting.

00:55.410 --> 00:56.653
- He's your editor.
- I know that.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.240
<i>Hey, Greg!</i>

00:58.280 --> 01:00.830
Can we get you some coffee
or some tea or...?

01:00.870 --> 01:03.750
- Do you have some bai hao white tip?
- I do!

01:03.790 --> 01:06.000
Oh, well, there you go.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.580
So, what did you think
of the manuscript?

01:09.630 --> 01:12.590
- It's rough, of course, but...
- I think it's really interesting.

01:12.630 --> 01:14.880
- Oh, I'm so happy!
- The dad and the horse.

01:14.930 --> 01:16.800
I know, right?
Well...

01:16.840 --> 01:18.379
- There's just one little thing.
- <i>Sure.</i>

01:18.390 --> 01:21.100
We do need a bit more
of the presidency in there.

01:21.140 --> 01:23.850
I mean, the book ends with
you going off to college.

01:23.890 --> 01:26.600
That's right, yes,
and the presidential stuff

01:26.650 --> 01:29.520
will be in volume two...
"Meyer Ascendant."

01:29.560 --> 01:31.860
- And three... "The Meyer Year."
- Yes.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.480
I get that, and if you wanna
stick with this book as is,

01:34.530 --> 01:36.110
I completely understand.

01:36.150 --> 01:37.860
We're just gonna need
our advance back.

01:37.910 --> 01:39.950
- There was an advance?
- Quiet, quiet.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.160
And Moses led his people
to the land of...?

01:47.210 --> 01:49.120
- Hanukkah.
- Canaan, Rabbi.

01:49.170 --> 01:52.460
Shut up, Nikhil. This stupid
hat is too small for my head.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.710
- Yarmulke.
- Fine, this stupid hat is too small for my yarmulke.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.970
It's okay, Jonah.
Conversion to Judaism

01:58.010 --> 02:00.390
is about a commitment
to the Jewish lifestyle.

02:00.430 --> 02:02.890
Oh, good, 'cause all this learning
is giving me a yarmulke ache.

02:02.930 --> 02:06.020
Just to remind everybody
that next week,

02:06.060 --> 02:08.060
we'll be rededicating
the sanctuary.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.690
Sorry, I have to go to the White House.
President Meyer's unveiling.

02:10.729 --> 02:13.020
- Okay.
- The final invitation list went out,

02:13.070 --> 02:13.940
and you're not on it.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.900
Oh, Jesus Christ!

02:15.940 --> 02:18.325
I'm sorry, I can say that now and
still get into heaven, right?

02:18.360 --> 02:20.610
Actually, Jonah,
Jews don't believe in heaven.

02:20.660 --> 02:23.070
Shut the fuck up, Nikhil!

02:23.120 --> 02:25.240
Wait, Shawnee, how am I
gonna see my dog again?

02:25.290 --> 02:27.700
Is there, like,
a Jew place for dogs?

02:27.750 --> 02:31.080
<i>All right, Mike, we got 30
days to write a new draft.</i>

02:31.130 --> 02:32.960
Get out that diary,
pick a day, and let's go.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.170
- June 14th. Ooh, chock full.
- Oh, goody! Great. Go.

02:36.210 --> 02:37.670
Briefing on infrastructure bill,

02:37.720 --> 02:39.720
clutch with Wichita
notary group,

02:39.760 --> 02:43.010
review on legislative conference
regarding pharmaceutical labeling.

02:43.050 --> 02:45.050
We're fucked.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.270
I don't even
remember any of that.

02:47.310 --> 02:49.763
- Some things are so dull, you have to block them out.
- <i>No kidding.</i>

02:49.770 --> 02:52.440
I mean, I'm sure that I played with
Catherine when she was a child...

02:52.480 --> 02:55.440
- - ...but for the life of me,
I can't remember one second.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.480
- Oh, and there she is.
- Hey!

02:57.530 --> 03:00.190
Mom, we had a great wellness
check at the doctor's today.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.660
- So, is it a boy, is it a girl?
- Oh, right.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.370
It's a baby.

03:04.410 --> 03:05.580
- No.
- Mm-mm.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.660
We're not doing that.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.370
No, Mom, we don't wanna know.

03:08.410 --> 03:11.370
Catherine, you are not
going to be coy or twee

03:11.420 --> 03:13.170
about the sex of my grandchild.

03:13.210 --> 03:15.590
This is a human being
you're making,

03:15.630 --> 03:19.340
not some Brooklyn-based,
artisanal chocolate bar.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.420
Birth gender
isn't even that relevant.

03:21.470 --> 03:24.390
She/he will decide her/his ideal
gender when she/he is/are ready.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.430
Okay, is that how we're
talking now, Marjorie,

03:26.470 --> 03:29.140
like some sort of
bi-curious Porky Pig?

03:29.180 --> 03:31.560
I'm not doing that.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.020
I had an aunt
who transitioned twice.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.270
She was trapped inside a man, and then that
man was trapped inside of another woman.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.570
- Oh, like a turducken.
- Mm-hmm.

03:38.610 --> 03:39.940
Mom, it's not
that big of a deal.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.950
We have baby names
picked out either way.

03:41.990 --> 03:43.700
Yes, Leslie or Dana
if it's a boy and...

03:43.740 --> 03:45.780
And for a girl we like Linus.

03:45.830 --> 03:47.073
- Seriously?
- That feels like child abuse.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.870
Yes.
Okay, I can't.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.290
<i>Can you just go away, Catherine?</i>

03:50.330 --> 03:52.330
That's fine.
We're late anyway.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.420
Richard has doula class
and we're bringing the snacks.

03:54.460 --> 03:57.130
- What?
- It'll be my first human birth, so.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.960
- What is happening?
- What is happening?

03:59.010 --> 04:00.760
- It just...
- Gender is simple!

04:00.800 --> 04:02.800
- Right.
- You're a girl, I'm a boy.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.390
Well. Hey, what about
some of that lezzy stuff?

04:05.430 --> 04:07.050
You think that would
spice up the book?

04:07.100 --> 04:09.680
Catherine's forbidden affair
with your Secret Service agent.

04:09.720 --> 04:13.480
Yeah, but, I mean, does anybody really give
a shit about two average-looking lesbians?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.230
- I don't mind them.
- Ugh.

04:15.270 --> 04:17.690
I'll tell you one thing
people would flip out about.

04:17.730 --> 04:18.610
Hmm?

04:19.990 --> 04:22.280
A book about my sex life.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.900
Seriously. I mean,
obviously, we can't do that.

04:24.950 --> 04:28.030
- Yeah, you can't do that.
- Really? Why can't we?

04:28.080 --> 04:32.120
- You can do that.
- I mean, that book would fly off the shelves.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.040
- <i>Fly.</i> - People would pay whatever
it is a book costs, you know?

04:35.080 --> 04:37.540
And everybody knows
that I dated Charlie Baird.

04:37.590 --> 04:39.170
Aw, Charlie.

04:39.210 --> 04:40.833
But there's somebody else
that I slept with.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.210
Somebody that
I worked with closely.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.590
All due respect, ma'am,
we all knew you were, uh...

04:46.640 --> 04:48.850
...with Kent.
Kent?!

04:48.890 --> 04:50.430
My snatch isn't a data port!

04:50.470 --> 04:51.930
What are you talking about?

04:51.980 --> 04:53.980
I slept with Tom James!

04:54.020 --> 04:56.230
- Whoa!
- No!

04:56.270 --> 04:58.190
In the white-hot
White House.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.020
In the Oval
with your running mate?!

05:00.070 --> 05:02.980
- On a couch.
- Ma'am, we have a best-seller!

05:03.030 --> 05:05.950
I mean, it was
the Green Room, but.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.530
- What? How do you know that?
- You... you said it was at the Congressional Ball.

05:09.580 --> 05:11.200
- Oh, did I say that?
- I think so.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.490
- Did I?
- Ma'am, we got gold. Gold!

05:13.540 --> 05:15.580
Do you think I should
give him a call?

05:15.620 --> 05:17.033
- That's a classy move.
<i>- Yeah, I'll get his number.</i>

05:17.040 --> 05:19.210
Or I could go and I could
see him in person.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.123
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- You want me to go with? I can take notes.

05:21.130 --> 05:23.250
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- No. Mm-mm.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.170
<i>- It's the new
- "CBS This Morning."</i>

05:26.220 --> 05:28.300
Welcome to the new
"CBS This Morning."

05:28.340 --> 05:30.390
- I'm Dan Egan.
- And I'm Brie Ramachandran.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.470
Jane McCabe is on
special assignment.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.173
We start our day
in the state of New Hampshire

05:34.180 --> 05:36.430
where Hurricane Chloe has
taken a turn for the deadly.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.730
So boring.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.350
God, how can anybody
jerk off to her

05:39.400 --> 05:40.690
with him sitting right there?

05:40.730 --> 05:42.480
I'm sure you'll find
a way, Congressman.

05:42.530 --> 05:45.610
The Ethics Committee
is debating ending its probe

05:45.650 --> 05:48.110
into Representative Lawler's
Nantucket trip.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.450
You will vote yes
despite the strong evidence

05:50.490 --> 05:52.780
of cocaine use
and reckless boating.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.660
- That guy knows how to party.
- Then Tuesday,

05:54.700 --> 05:57.250
you have the White House meeting
on raising the debt ceiling.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.413
Unless they try to kick it down
the road for a couple of months

05:59.420 --> 06:01.290
<i>and hope we get hit
by an asteroid.</i>

06:01.340 --> 06:02.960
Are you listening
to anything we're saying?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.260
Yeah! Cocaine, boating,
asteroids, whatever!

06:06.300 --> 06:08.550
Did you guys get invited
to this unveiling thing?

06:08.590 --> 06:11.180
- Naturally.
- How come you guys got invited and I didn't?

06:11.220 --> 06:12.303
Because we worked
for the president

06:12.310 --> 06:14.260
and didn't cost her
the presidency.

06:14.310 --> 06:16.470
And because we don't look
like Herman Munster's brother

06:16.520 --> 06:18.890
who liked to molest
that pudgy werewolf kid.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.610
Charlie, also played by Fred Gwynne.
Season one, episode nine.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.110
Kent, can I have
your plus-one?

06:24.150 --> 06:25.900
No, I'm bringing
my jai alai instructor.

06:25.940 --> 06:28.360
- Female.
- Ish.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.063
- What about your plus-one?
- I work for you, I don't date you.

06:30.070 --> 06:31.700
Maybe I'm gonna go
hire some women,

06:31.740 --> 06:34.780
and I'm gonna make them date me.

06:34.830 --> 06:38.580
And tomorrow, a sex
offender registry for dogs.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.290
- It's about time.
- Mm-hmm.

06:40.330 --> 06:42.500
Until then,
I'm Brie Ramachandran.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.670
And I'm Dan Egan,
bringing you your morning

06:44.710 --> 06:48.300
every morning of every day
for many mornings to come.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.970
And we are clear.
Great show, people!

06:51.010 --> 06:52.293
What'd you think
of that new sign-off?

06:52.300 --> 06:53.253
You sound like a Scientologist.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.100
- Really?
- Kind of.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.633
Can I talk to you for a second...
actually, both of you, in here?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.310
- Yeah.
- So, we got the results back

06:58.350 --> 07:00.600
from the first testing
of the new host pairing.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.150
- Oh, good!
- And something interesting jumps out from the data,

07:03.190 --> 07:06.610
which is people say that you
two don't have any chemistry,

07:06.650 --> 07:09.690
which is their words,
not mine, but also mine.

07:09.740 --> 07:11.820
I've never not had
chemistry with a woman.

07:11.870 --> 07:13.950
People like the energy
that you and Jane had.

07:13.990 --> 07:16.080
It was this raw, sexual vibe
because you two were...

07:16.200 --> 07:18.040
Jesus, we were not fucking!

07:18.080 --> 07:20.033
Okay, going down on each other, whatever.
I don't wanna know!

07:20.040 --> 07:23.580
- Oh, my God!
- The point is people find you two cold together.

07:23.630 --> 07:27.710
- But I... I'm actually fucking her.
- Dan!

07:27.760 --> 07:29.800
- Aren't you engaged to a Yankee?
- Yeah, I am.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.630
- That's why I told you not to tell anybody.
- Aw, that's sweet.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.890
Look, Dan, Brie, you two don't
have to make up this crazy story

07:35.930 --> 07:38.220
- about you two fucking.
- We're not making this up, okay?

07:38.270 --> 07:40.310
- We are fucking!
- Like, a lot.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.933
Maybe you two should fuck differently, then.
I don't know.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.210
That's where I draw
the line, man.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.690
I don't take notes
on how I fuck.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.440
I, however... I am
willing to do anything,

07:46.480 --> 07:49.480
because I cannot lose this job,
not before my wedding!

07:49.530 --> 07:52.030
Um, also...
just a little thing here...

07:52.070 --> 07:53.360
people don't like you in yellow.

07:53.410 --> 07:55.620
- Okay.
<i>- See? Told you.</i>

07:55.660 --> 07:57.740
<i>Jesus Christ, Tom.</i>

07:57.790 --> 07:59.660
- What is this?
- This is just temporary.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.540
We're moving into
the big office next month.

08:01.580 --> 08:04.250
- Oh, good, yeah.
- I was feeling cramped.

08:04.290 --> 08:07.380
- My goodness, look at you. You keeping busy?
- I am.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.703
Yeah, I made a deal
to write a book,

08:08.710 --> 08:10.050
as a matter of fact.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.760
Well, that's funny
because I did, too.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.640
Yes, I wrote a blurb
for your upcoming tome.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.510
- Of course you did.
- Sight unseen.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.970
<i>Yeah, what is...
the title is</i>

08:19.020 --> 08:21.720
- "Investing with a Conscience"?
- "Conscience," yes.

08:21.770 --> 08:23.730
So, it's sci-fi?

08:23.770 --> 08:26.520
- Just trying to keep
the lights on.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.723
Well, the book that I'm writing,

08:27.730 --> 08:29.360
I wanted to give you
a heads-up

08:29.400 --> 08:32.280
'cause I was toying
with the notion of...

08:32.320 --> 08:34.280
of perhaps mentioning our...

08:35.450 --> 08:37.030
our little encounter.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.159
Selina, there's...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.323
- No, that's all right.
- There's something I wanted to say.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.740
You know, you did me the honor

08:41.789 --> 08:44.000
of choosing me
as your running mate...

08:44.039 --> 08:46.670
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and I repaid that honor with betrayal.

08:48.170 --> 08:49.250
Yeah.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.670
I guess my ego allowed me

08:51.710 --> 08:53.920
to believe that
folksy, old Tom James

08:53.970 --> 08:55.720
was above all that
beltway horseshit.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.010
And in the end, I just turned out
to be another blue bottle fly

09:00.060 --> 09:03.850
feeding on a heaping mouthful
of Seabiscuit's finest.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.690
Wow!

09:06.730 --> 09:09.270
I didn't come here
to ask for an apology,

09:09.320 --> 09:11.980
- but I certainly appreciate getting one from you.
- You deserve it.

09:12.030 --> 09:14.400
If it makes you feel any better,

09:14.450 --> 09:17.403
if I was in your shoes, I probably would've
tried to steal the presidency, too.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.950
Well, that's what made the two of
us such a beatable combination.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.990
Yeah.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.830
Selina, I beg you,
please don't do this.

09:24.870 --> 09:27.870
- Oh.
- I have a new life, I have a new wife.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.130
And we are expecting
our first child.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.500
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:32.550 --> 09:34.340
She would be dialing
a divorce lawyer

09:34.380 --> 09:36.373
if she ever thought that you
and I had swapped more than,

09:36.380 --> 09:38.050
you know, appreciative memos.

09:38.140 --> 09:40.140
- You understand that?
- I do.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.800
Well, I guess

09:41.970 --> 09:46.770
I will have to think
outside my box.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.400
Right.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.690
Oh, my God,
why did I have to fuck

09:53.740 --> 09:56.320
the last remaining
gentleman in Washington?

09:56.360 --> 09:58.860
- God!
- Who said that? Was that Dolley Madison?

09:58.910 --> 10:00.820
It was James Madison.

10:00.870 --> 10:03.370
- Okay, Mike, get up.
- So, how'd it go?

10:03.410 --> 10:06.580
Well, he just begged me
not to put it in.

10:06.620 --> 10:08.000
So, none of it goes in the book?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.960
- No, it all goes in.
- Good.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.880
<i>With regards to
the debt ceiling,</i>

10:12.920 --> 10:15.500
I think we can all agree that
none of us wants to play politics

10:15.550 --> 10:18.380
with the full faith and credit
of the United States.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.010
<i>I brought you here...</i>

10:20.050 --> 10:21.970
Hey, did you get invited
to the Meyer unveiling?

10:22.010 --> 10:24.390
Everyone was
unless you're a mole person

10:24.430 --> 10:26.140
who was cast out
of his underground society

10:26.180 --> 10:27.890
for keistering sewer rats.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.140
- I wasn't invited.
- I know.

10:30.190 --> 10:32.020
- Roger.
- Madam President,

10:32.070 --> 10:34.570
my extremist colleagues on
the other side of the aisle

10:34.610 --> 10:37.150
have launched a full-fledged
and savage attack

10:37.200 --> 10:39.900
against the poor and
disadvantaged of this country.

10:39.950 --> 10:44.080
You are addicted to spending like
the proverbial drunken sailor.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.080
Okay, that part's done.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.863
I can give you a freeze
on the rate of increase

10:47.870 --> 10:51.750
on AFDC and all the Head Start
cuts, but no dice on Medicare.

10:51.790 --> 10:52.953
- I can live with that.
- All right, gentlemen,

10:52.960 --> 10:54.960
let's get this passed tomorrow.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.050
Uh, excuse me, Ms. Caruso,
due to some oversight,

10:58.090 --> 11:00.880
I did not receive my invite
to the unveiling ceremony.

11:00.930 --> 11:03.640
I suggest you ask someone
from President Meyer's team.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.713
- Candi, are you all right?
- Of course she's all right.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.810
Why are women always
checking in on one another

11:07.850 --> 11:09.430
when I am talking to them?

11:09.480 --> 11:11.270
Ma'am, I would
appreciate it very much

11:11.310 --> 11:13.560
if I could have an invite
to the unveiling thing.

11:13.610 --> 11:15.440
That is President Meyer's
invitation list.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.150
It is her fiesta,
as you would say.

11:18.190 --> 11:21.860
Well, it's your casa white-o,
as you would say.

11:21.910 --> 11:25.240
- Madam President, are you all right?
- Oh, for God's sakes.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.819
You haven't heard
the last of Jonah Ryan.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.830
Okay, Jeffersons, sit down.

11:29.870 --> 11:31.830
The Black Caucus gets this
room back in 20 minutes.

11:31.870 --> 11:33.330
I do not wanna
piss those guys off.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.000
Oh, we were talking
about the name,

11:35.040 --> 11:38.170
and Cherry Tree Choppers
sounds a lot more legitimate.

11:38.210 --> 11:40.090
No! We already
picked a name.

11:40.130 --> 11:42.380
We're the Jeffersons, period.

11:42.430 --> 11:45.300
- How about the Rough Riders?
- Oh, fuck, that's good!

11:45.350 --> 11:48.260
No, we're already known
as the Jeffersons, okay?

11:48.310 --> 11:50.470
And right now,
we need to do something,

11:50.520 --> 11:54.560
something big that makes Montez
really pay attention to us.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.060
- Mm-hmm.
- Something like ending Daylight Savings Time.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.400
- Yes.
- Something like ending government waste.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.490
- Yeah.
- Cutting aid to Israel!

12:01.530 --> 12:03.950
Whoa, no! We're not gonna do that.
Are you crazy?

12:03.990 --> 12:05.870
- Cutting aid to veterans.
- Great!

12:05.910 --> 12:07.950
- They volunteered, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.620
We're gonna do all these things,

12:09.660 --> 12:11.870
and we're gonna get invited
to that unveiling.

12:11.910 --> 12:14.420
- Who's with me? Yeah!
- Yeah!

12:14.460 --> 12:17.500
- Yeah!
- Wait, you weren't invited?

12:17.550 --> 12:19.090
- No. Were you?
- Yeah.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.800
Oh, for Christ's sake.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.890
Why do you keep saying
Tom James and I made love?

12:25.930 --> 12:27.760
Are you
a 15-year-old girl?

12:27.810 --> 12:29.890
- No.
- Richard!

12:29.930 --> 12:32.183
- Yes, ma'am?
- I want you to get my editor on the phone, okay?

12:32.190 --> 12:35.020
No, see, you gotta find a
different word than "screwed."

12:35.060 --> 12:37.480
It's just hard to come up with
so many different ways to curse.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.520
Please hold for President Meyer. I've
got Greg Morehouse for you, ma'am.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.820
Greg? Hello!

12:42.860 --> 12:46.320
Okay, so I have got
a White House book

12:46.370 --> 12:49.580
that is hotter than Nancy
Reagan's guide to cocksucking.

12:49.620 --> 12:50.870
I kid you not.

12:50.910 --> 12:52.290
You are gonna be so pleased!

12:52.330 --> 12:53.330
I... what?

12:55.080 --> 12:57.170
Oh, right.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.290
Richard, go and turn on
CBS right now.

12:59.340 --> 13:00.840
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

13:00.880 --> 13:03.710
- Hey, Tom James is on TV.
- He looks good.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.840
That's the reason I've always said
that Selina Meyer's political acumen

13:06.890 --> 13:08.590
is sharp as any
you'll find in Washington.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.390
What's wrong with that?
My goodness.

13:10.430 --> 13:13.970
Even so, I did not expect
to find myself on a couch

13:14.020 --> 13:16.730
in the Green Room
at the White House, um...

13:16.770 --> 13:19.020
Having sex with
President Selina Meyer.

13:19.070 --> 13:21.150
- Right.
- Oh, my.

13:21.190 --> 13:23.183
Tom James, who is telling us
about the explosive revelations

13:23.190 --> 13:25.530
in his book
"Investing with a Conscience,"

13:25.570 --> 13:27.570
excerpted in this month's
"Vanity Fair."

13:27.620 --> 13:30.660
"Vanity Fair?" Mike, how did
we not know about this?

13:30.700 --> 13:32.490
They called me
a couple months ago

13:32.540 --> 13:34.533
and I thought they were trying to
get me to renew my prescription.

13:34.540 --> 13:37.460
- Subscription! <i>I had always
looked up to President Meyer</i>

13:37.500 --> 13:39.080
as something of a mentor.

13:39.130 --> 13:40.880
She's a year older than me.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.670
Okay, that is a fucking lie!

13:43.710 --> 13:45.420
I mean, where's
the follow-up question?

13:45.470 --> 13:47.090
- This is disinformation!
- Yeah!

13:47.130 --> 13:51.050
Now, Senator, was President
Meyer the aggressor?

13:51.100 --> 13:52.680
Your word, not mine.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.310
- But again, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.350 --> 13:55.930
I didn't rape him!

13:55.980 --> 13:57.690
He wishes!

13:57.730 --> 14:00.230
Ma'am, I think
he's talking about you!

14:00.270 --> 14:03.070
<i>- My guest has been
- Tom James.</i>

14:03.110 --> 14:04.900
The book is "Investing
with a Conscience."

14:04.940 --> 14:07.900
I can't believe I said
that steaming turd of a book

14:07.950 --> 14:09.570
was a refreshing take
on Wall Street

14:09.620 --> 14:11.700
aimed at your conscience
and your funny bone.

14:11.740 --> 14:14.330
- Hey, you used my blurb!
- Oh, quiet up, Mike.

14:17.370 --> 14:18.960
Gary, call the White House

14:19.000 --> 14:22.330
and tell them to cancel
that stupid portrait thing,

14:22.380 --> 14:24.130
'cause I don't wanna go.

14:24.170 --> 14:25.623
What are you talking about?
You have to go.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.340
I just can't take this,
you know?

14:27.380 --> 14:28.720
I've taken the rest of it.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.510
I took the election loss,

14:30.550 --> 14:32.760
I took Andrew's infidelity,

14:32.810 --> 14:35.930
- Catherine's Catherine-ness, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

14:35.980 --> 14:38.930
But this I cannot take.

14:38.980 --> 14:41.940
Listen to me, Tom is a weak man.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.650
It wasn't even that good,
I gotta tell you.

14:43.690 --> 14:45.820
Oh, please give me
the permission

14:45.860 --> 14:47.690
to tell that
to his face tomorrow.

14:47.740 --> 14:49.280
- Please, I beg you.
- Oh, my God, right.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.280
I forgot Tom is gonna be there.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.280
This is like
Black History Month.

14:54.330 --> 14:56.040
It never fucking ends!

14:56.080 --> 14:57.200
Do you want me to 69 him?

14:59.790 --> 15:01.960
- Oh, 86.
- Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.170
No, because then
it just becomes this thing.

15:04.210 --> 15:06.043
Okay, what about the speech? What
about the speech, all right?

15:06.050 --> 15:10.420
President Montez is giving
that amazing speech about you.

15:10.470 --> 15:13.550
And I asked them to use the
Jackie Kennedy crystal service.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.970
- Really?
- Yep.

15:16.020 --> 15:17.600
Nobody since Jackie

15:17.640 --> 15:19.560
has given as much
for their country as you.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.020
That is true.

15:21.060 --> 15:23.020
If Jackie Kennedy
can go through the day

15:23.060 --> 15:25.013
with her husband's philandering
brains all over her dress

15:25.020 --> 15:28.070
and her head held high,
looking stunning,

15:28.110 --> 15:31.900
even though they made her ride around in a
convertible like an animal, I might add,

15:31.950 --> 15:33.950
you can go to
the White House tomorrow

15:33.990 --> 15:35.990
and forget all about
those 15 minutes

15:36.040 --> 15:38.790
where he couldn't even unzip
the back of your dress.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.580
Wait a minute, what?
How do you know that?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.120
It was in Mike's notes.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.580
Oh, right.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.590
Okay, fine, I'll go.

15:50.630 --> 15:53.300
Okay? But I am not
gonna have a good time.

15:53.340 --> 15:57.390
And if one person
mentions Tom James to me,

15:57.430 --> 15:59.600
I'm gonna go piss
in that punch bowl.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.560
- This country doesn't deserve you.
- I know it.

16:04.020 --> 16:06.690
Voting closes in five minutes
and we're still missing votes.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.940
Well, well, well, sorry, boys,

16:08.980 --> 16:12.650
no votes today on legalizing tiny
Fleshlights for micro wangs.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.200
Except for you, Gellardi.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.863
I'd wager it takes
a whole roll of duct tape

16:15.870 --> 16:17.990
to strap down
your hog of a cock.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.620
For your information, we're
called the Jeffersons, probably,

16:20.660 --> 16:22.910
and we're here to shove
some liberty up America's ass.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.920
If you'll excuse me, Roger,
I'm gonna whip it out.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.500
Madam Clerk,
Representative Gellardi

16:27.590 --> 16:31.170
votes no on HR 2970.

16:31.220 --> 16:32.460
- Recorded.
<i>- Madam Clerk,</i>

16:32.510 --> 16:36.340
Representative Clark
votes no on HR 2970.

16:36.390 --> 16:38.260
This was a done deal!

16:38.310 --> 16:41.310
Now look what you did, you writhing,
piss-filled skin Twizzler!

16:41.350 --> 16:43.520
You made Speaker Marwood
run all the way down here!

16:43.560 --> 16:46.400
Now the clots in his legs
are gonna rush to his brain.

16:46.440 --> 16:51.230
And maybe you were too busy biting James
Bond's cable car wire to realize,

16:51.280 --> 16:53.070
but if we don't raise
the debt ceiling,

16:53.110 --> 16:56.360
America's financial system is gonna
go belly-up like what, Will?

16:56.410 --> 17:00.410
Like my labradoodle, Teddy, when I cover his
cock in honey and give him a sticky licky.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.410
- No, bad!
- Look at me.

17:02.460 --> 17:06.420
You could shut down
the government.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.420
Well, maybe the government
needs to be shut down

17:08.460 --> 17:10.000
- because it's broken.
- Oh!

17:10.170 --> 17:12.000
And when something's broken,
you shut it down,

17:12.050 --> 17:14.170
and then you turn it back on
again like with a router.

17:14.220 --> 17:16.300
And if they didn't want me
to shut down the government,

17:16.339 --> 17:18.970
then maybe they should've invited
me to the Meyer unveiling!

17:19.010 --> 17:21.310
Do you even know what
an unveiling ceremony is?!

17:21.349 --> 17:24.430
Look, whether I know
what an unveiling is or is not

17:24.480 --> 17:25.480
is not the point.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.060
The point is principles.

17:27.099 --> 17:31.060
My God. Just call off
your morons, Congressman.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.110
My morons are voting no.

17:36.910 --> 17:40.240
Madam Clerk, on HR 2970,

17:40.370 --> 17:43.200
Congressman Ryan votes no.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.410
Lights out!

17:45.460 --> 17:47.960
Lights out! Lights out!

17:48.000 --> 17:51.170
Lights out! Lights out!
Lights out!

17:51.210 --> 17:53.710
<i>Oof, here we are.</i>

17:53.760 --> 17:56.220
Look at this place.
It is such a dump, isn't it?

17:56.260 --> 17:58.130
Although, I have to admit
I sort of miss it.

17:58.180 --> 17:59.890
Aw, and it misses you, too.

17:59.930 --> 18:01.890
The one who got away.

18:01.930 --> 18:04.430
And now she's back
for her big day!

18:04.480 --> 18:06.850
- Are you wearing makeup?
- No.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.100
Yeah.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.940
Madam President!

18:09.980 --> 18:11.310
It is so lovely
to see you again.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.520
- My daughter misses you.
- Thank you...

18:13.570 --> 18:16.530
- I have no idea what these people's names are.
- ...so much!

18:16.570 --> 18:19.200
I know one thing... she's the one
who put my sweater in the dryer.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.910
- Yes!
- Right.

18:20.950 --> 18:23.620
Madam President, we've sure
missed you around here.

18:23.660 --> 18:25.370
- Oh, thank you...
- Friend.

18:25.410 --> 18:26.910
...friend.

18:26.960 --> 18:30.120
Where are you taking
the Jackie crystal?

18:30.170 --> 18:32.170
- Such a shame.
- What's happening right now?

18:32.210 --> 18:35.250
- What are those, chips?
- Why is there Coke Zero behind us?

18:35.300 --> 18:37.003
Ma'am, your guests
will arrive in a half hour.

18:37.010 --> 18:38.920
And they set up
the Blue Room for your use.

18:38.970 --> 18:40.550
What is this Dixie cup
shit show?

18:40.590 --> 18:43.470
It's like we teleported
to post-Katrina Mississippi.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.470
<i>- I know!
- There's no tablecloths.</i>

18:45.520 --> 18:48.270
Montez is really taking
this Mexican thing too far.

18:48.310 --> 18:49.553
- Morning, ma'am.
- Hey, what is this?

18:49.560 --> 18:50.980
Well, as of a few minutes ago,

18:51.020 --> 18:53.520
Jonah and his merry band
of jizz huffers

18:53.570 --> 18:56.230
drove their short bus
right into the debt ceiling vote

18:56.280 --> 18:58.030
and T-boned
the entire US economy.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.030
Treasury Secretary Baird ordered

19:00.070 --> 19:01.403
- a full government shutdown.
- Shutdown.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.620
All nonessential
White House staff

19:03.660 --> 19:05.276
have been furloughed,
starting immediately.

19:05.290 --> 19:06.660
- Okay.
- Hey, Mom, everyone.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.290
- Did we miss it?
- No, I'm afraid not.

19:09.330 --> 19:12.210
You know, there's not even a punch
bowl for me to piss in here.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.460
Marjorie, Catherine,

19:14.500 --> 19:15.630
congratulations are in order.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.840
Oh, right!
Thank you.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.170
We just hit
the 12-week mark.

19:20.970 --> 19:22.130
It's a boy.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.140
- Congressman Furlong.
- Brookheimer!

19:31.190 --> 19:33.520
Got your dong of a résumé.

19:33.560 --> 19:36.360
I know you'd chew your own arm
off to escape being handcuffed

19:36.400 --> 19:39.820
to Meyers's overly toned corpse
and her dungeon of losers,

19:39.860 --> 19:41.245
but I had to go
in another direction.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.400
Tell her why, Will.

19:42.450 --> 19:44.110
You're stronger than me,

19:44.160 --> 19:46.580
and you have a higher reserve
of dignity and self-worth.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.370
And I'm trapped
in a cycle of abuse.

19:48.410 --> 19:49.950
Better luck next time.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.250
Hey, Fuckleberry Finn!

19:51.290 --> 19:54.120
Christ, you got old.

19:54.170 --> 19:57.670
- You wanna work for that guy?
- I really do.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.550
- Tom! Hi!
- Madam President.

19:59.590 --> 20:01.420
What are you doing here?

20:01.470 --> 20:03.380
Can I have
a private word with you?

20:03.430 --> 20:06.260
Would that be all right, or are you
afraid that I'll rape you again?

20:06.310 --> 20:08.430
Well...

20:08.470 --> 20:10.553
- Well, sure, let... all right.
- Come, come, come, yes, yes, yeah.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.810
Hi. Yeah, so good
to see you, too.

20:14.610 --> 20:17.560
I can't believe that
I gave you a goddamn blurb.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.570
- Why, Tom? Why did you do that?
- Come on, Selina.

20:19.610 --> 20:22.440
For Christ's sake, we both
know how the game is played.

20:22.490 --> 20:25.410
I came to you in good
faith and I asked!

20:25.450 --> 20:27.490
- Well...
- I did the classy thing.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.783
Come on, we both know you were
gonna go ahead and do it anyway.

20:29.790 --> 20:33.710
Of course I was, but I had the
courtesy to seem like I might not!

20:33.750 --> 20:36.330
And then with
that TV appearance.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.540
Me the aggressor?
What is that?!

20:38.590 --> 20:41.460
That is sick, sociopathic shit.

20:41.510 --> 20:43.760
I'm worried about you.
I think you need help.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.800
- I need help? Oh, please!
- Absolutely.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.550
You've got more issues
than "National Geographic."

20:48.600 --> 20:50.970
What's going on here?
I don't understand.

20:51.020 --> 20:53.680
- Did I do something to deserve this?
- No, no!

20:53.770 --> 20:55.640
You did nothing.

20:55.690 --> 20:57.520
Wait a minute, what was that?

20:57.560 --> 21:00.900
Did I hurt your feelings
because I, what...

21:00.940 --> 21:02.570
because I didn't
call you afterwards?

21:02.610 --> 21:04.030
Oh, that is just so stupid.

21:04.070 --> 21:05.700
And I would've said
the same thing to you

21:05.740 --> 21:07.240
a year ago if you had called me.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.950
Oh, ho, ho! So, you
did want me to call.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.370
Oh, oh, poor Tommy.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.790
- He wanted me to call him afterwards.
- Shut the fuck up!

21:25.130 --> 21:27.630
Sorry, I should not have
raised my voice like that.

21:27.680 --> 21:32.010
Madam President, thank you for
inviting us to your unveiling.

21:32.060 --> 21:33.770
My wife is a huge fan.

21:37.980 --> 21:41.110
Yeah, well, you know what,
you can have your trophy wife

21:41.150 --> 21:44.480
and your trophy office
and your trophy baby,

21:44.530 --> 21:47.570
who you won't even live
to see go to college,

21:47.610 --> 21:51.530
but I still got to be president,
and, tsk, you never will.

21:56.290 --> 21:58.830
Oh! I was looking for you. They're
waiting for you to begin.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.670
I swear to God, Tom James just
wanted to fuck me right now.

22:02.710 --> 22:04.630
- What?!
- Yeah, we had a real moment.

22:04.670 --> 22:06.880
But he's too much of a pussy
to go for my pussy.

22:06.930 --> 22:08.333
Okay, well, that's
probably for the best.

22:08.340 --> 22:09.680
He's not gonna
get away with that.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, ma'am!

22:11.180 --> 22:13.970
I'm back.
What the hell was that?

22:14.060 --> 22:15.930
You really wanted me,
didn't you?

22:15.980 --> 22:19.350
There were sparks practically
flying out of your dick!

22:19.400 --> 22:21.190
Why am I getting
this sense of déjà vu?

22:21.230 --> 22:22.643
No, no, no, I'm not talking
about the Green Room.

22:22.650 --> 22:24.480
That was just a good,
old-fashioned hate fuck.

22:24.530 --> 22:27.490
Selina, I do not
and never have hated you!

22:27.530 --> 22:29.650
You got that right!
You loved me.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.030
- Stop it!
- You still love me now.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.870
- What?!
- You do! Admit it.

22:33.910 --> 22:36.500
- Admit it. Admit it!
- You are fucking crazy!

22:39.370 --> 22:42.670
Okay, right there, right there,
what do you call that?

22:42.710 --> 22:44.420
- What was that?
- That was...

22:44.460 --> 22:46.130
You want to throw me
onto this couch

22:46.170 --> 22:49.720
and pin my legs
behind my head and do me.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.043
- I am a happily married man, Selina.
- Oh, that's not an answer!

22:52.050 --> 22:53.550
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

22:53.600 --> 22:55.140
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

22:57.980 --> 23:00.770
Okay, wha... this!

23:00.810 --> 23:02.118
What do you want me
to say, Selina?

23:02.150 --> 23:04.560
What do you want me
to say, Tom, huh?

23:04.610 --> 23:06.400
That back when
I was in the Senate,

23:06.440 --> 23:09.530
the only reason
that I co-sponsored S-473

23:09.570 --> 23:11.030
was because
I had a crush on you?

23:11.070 --> 23:12.910
That when we were in Los Angeles

23:12.950 --> 23:15.370
and we walked out onto the stage
to accept the nomination,

23:15.410 --> 23:18.120
and you grabbed my hand and you
held it up high, and I was like,

23:18.160 --> 23:21.120
"Oh, my God,
he's holding my hand."

23:21.170 --> 23:23.540
That when I was
in the loony bin,

23:23.590 --> 23:25.670
- I thought about you
endlessly, and I was...

23:25.710 --> 23:27.710
Tom?

23:27.760 --> 23:28.880
Sweetheart.

23:30.380 --> 23:31.880
This is my wife, Alethia.

23:31.930 --> 23:33.970
Alethia?

23:34.010 --> 23:36.430
Is that her name or is that the
pill you take to fuck her?

23:36.470 --> 23:38.720
- Alethia!
- So nice to meet you, President Meyer.

23:38.770 --> 23:40.640
- Oh, that's so nice of you.
- I voted for you.

23:40.690 --> 23:42.480
Well, it didn't help.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.560
Okay, you know,
I should head back

23:44.610 --> 23:47.860
and, uh, deal with
the ceremony and so on.

23:47.900 --> 23:48.860
Yes, yes, yes.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.320
You love me.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.450
I...!

23:52.490 --> 23:54.030
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

23:54.070 --> 23:55.023
<i>the President
of the United States.</i>

23:55.030 --> 23:57.450
Oh, wow, she looks awesome.

23:57.490 --> 24:00.160
I'd give my left tit
for those tits.

24:00.210 --> 24:02.580
Hello. <i>Buenas tardes.</i>
Good afternoon.

24:02.620 --> 24:04.790
<i>There are so many things</i>

24:04.840 --> 24:08.210
that I would like to say
about the extraordinary woman

24:08.260 --> 24:11.550
- <i>who was my predecessor here at the White House.</i>
- Here comes the love!

24:11.590 --> 24:13.930
- Shh, I know. Shh.
- But unfortunately,

24:13.970 --> 24:17.550
I have to return to the Oval
Office to deal with the shutdown.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.510
<i>I know Selina Meyer,</i>

24:19.560 --> 24:23.060
who has navigated
many crises in her own term,

24:23.100 --> 24:24.600
will understand.

24:24.650 --> 24:26.230
- <i>President Meyer.</i>
- Oh.

24:26.270 --> 24:27.230
Selina.

24:33.450 --> 24:37.320
Now, let's take a look at
this beautiful piece of work.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.200
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- It's beautiful.

24:41.250 --> 24:42.174
- Oh.
- That's beautiful.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.540
Thank you very, very much.
Thank you.

24:46.590 --> 24:49.790
Oh, goodness, I do wish you could've
heard President Montez's speech

24:49.840 --> 24:53.880
because she's so well-spoken,
don't you think?

24:53.930 --> 24:56.470
And this is very nice, folks.

24:56.510 --> 24:57.930
Very nice, indeed.

24:57.970 --> 24:59.010
You know, um...

25:00.640 --> 25:02.100
I look around this room

25:02.140 --> 25:04.430
and I see so many portraits

25:04.480 --> 25:07.310
of... of so many
of our great presidents,

25:07.360 --> 25:11.980
and I am reminded
of their many accomplishments

25:12.070 --> 25:13.530
and shining moments.

25:13.570 --> 25:16.280
<i>But I also like to think</i>

25:16.320 --> 25:20.280
perhaps about their
not-so-shining moments.

25:20.330 --> 25:22.580
<i>And that, um...</i>

25:25.250 --> 25:26.750
well, maybe none of it matters.

25:26.790 --> 25:31.840
You know, because maybe
in a hundred years,

25:31.880 --> 25:34.710
all that anyone will remember

25:34.760 --> 25:37.840
is that you have your portrait

25:37.890 --> 25:40.390
hanging on a wall
in the White House.

25:40.430 --> 25:45.390
So, out of respect
for the furlough,

25:45.440 --> 25:47.480
um, I think we should
wrap things up.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.020
So, thank you so much.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.770
What a...
what a wonderful thing.

25:50.820 --> 25:52.190
Thank you.

25:54.110 --> 25:55.820
That was a great speech.

25:55.860 --> 25:58.320
Yeah, that cow
put the chair in the painting.

25:58.370 --> 26:01.370
- What chair?
- The fucking chair in that painting

26:01.410 --> 26:03.910
<i>is the chair that
she made love to Andrew on.</i>

26:03.950 --> 26:06.660
- I slept in that chair.
- And look at my neck.

26:06.710 --> 26:08.960
I... no,
in the painting!

26:09.000 --> 26:13.090
Look at my neck. I have pardoned
turkeys with fewer waddles.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.300
My neck does not look like that.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.720
No, it doesn't.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.380
- Madam President.
- Oh, yes!

26:18.430 --> 26:19.930
- I'm sorry.
- This is John Corbin.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.590
- He's Montez's me.
- Great.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.810
Not exactly.
I have a law degree

26:23.850 --> 26:25.560
and served two tours
in Afghanistan.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.270
Oh, congrats.

26:27.310 --> 26:28.973
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to start clearing the room

26:28.980 --> 26:31.650
so we can furlough the rest of
the staff in a timely manner.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.020
Well, that makes solid sense.
We'll get out of your hair.

26:34.150 --> 26:36.110
Thank you so much.
Hello!

26:36.150 --> 26:37.940
- This goes inside your jacket.
- Oh.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.110
Ma'am, the painting is stunning.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.613
Well, thank you, Marjorie, but you're
not exactly known for your good taste.

26:42.620 --> 26:44.660
You know what,
this is your fault.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.910
- No!
- Yes! I should not have come to this thing.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.170
Jesus Christ,
underage Muslim brides

26:50.210 --> 26:52.210
- are less traumatized
at their unveiling. Shh.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.670
And even they don't
have to drink Coke Zero.

26:54.710 --> 26:58.840
- At least Jonah wasn't here.
- Hey, that's positive, see?

26:58.880 --> 27:01.590
A lot of people are saying
that I shut down the government.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.550
You're damn right, I did!

27:03.600 --> 27:06.970
I shut down the government
for wasting our money.

27:07.020 --> 27:10.850
I shut down the government for
interfering with our clocks and watches.

27:10.900 --> 27:14.940
I shut down the post office because
everybody just uses email anyway.

27:14.980 --> 27:18.400
I shut down NPR because
they're a total snoozefest,

27:18.450 --> 27:20.780
and they said this
shutdown was a bad idea.

27:20.820 --> 27:22.910
I shut down the national parks

27:22.950 --> 27:26.120
so that your parents will have to
take you someplace cool on vacation,

27:26.160 --> 27:29.370
like Disney World
or Cancun or Mexico.

27:29.410 --> 27:30.580
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

27:30.620 --> 27:31.870
Are there any questions?

27:31.920 --> 27:33.623
The congressman will not
be taking any questions.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.630
The congressman will not
be taking any questions.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.460
- Thank you.
- Provocative stuff there

27:37.510 --> 27:39.590
from the bad boy of
Washington, Jonah Ryan.

27:39.630 --> 27:42.050
Wall Street, meanwhile,
has reacted to the shutdown

27:42.220 --> 27:45.600
with what analysts are
urging us not to label a panic.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.560
Also, are we doing
our laundry all wrong?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.020
Japanese efficiency
experts say no.

27:51.060 --> 27:54.100
Plus, our own Buzzy Kanahale's
gonna be reporting the weather

27:54.150 --> 27:56.860
from the place that matters
the most... the beach.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.070
- Oof, wish I could join him there.
- Oh.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.570
Not me.

28:00.610 --> 28:02.860
I'm not down to my
bathing suit weight yet, so.

28:02.910 --> 28:05.113
Oh, please, Brie, I bet you could
fill out a bikini quite nicely.

28:05.120 --> 28:08.620
Oh, Dan.

28:08.660 --> 28:10.870
- Blech!
- Well, that's all the time we have for today.

28:10.910 --> 28:12.750
- I'm Dan Egan.
- Bring back Jane!

28:12.790 --> 28:15.420
- And I'm Brie Ramachandran.
- Remember,

28:15.460 --> 28:16.670
every day starts with morning.

28:16.710 --> 28:18.500
- You suck!
- Bye, now.
