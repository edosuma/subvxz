Previously on "Dead of Summer"...

00:02.721 --> 00:04.270
No one knows anything about him.

00:04.346 --> 00:05.734
You only want him
'cause you can't have him.

00:05.794 --> 00:07.054
We have a connection.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.038
Someone didn't want us to find this.

00:10.415 --> 00:11.463
What's with the box?

00:11.554 --> 00:12.667
It's a reminder.

00:13.537 --> 00:15.117
I had a bad dream last night.

00:15.177 --> 00:16.261
There were these people,

00:16.788 --> 00:17.887
wearing masks.

00:18.429 --> 00:20.198
I think they were doing
some kind of ritual.

00:20.315 --> 00:21.666
Amy!

00:22.170 --> 00:24.147
It appears we were wrong. It's her.

00:35.381 --> 00:38.598
Andrea! You are
going to ruin my flooring.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.731
Oh, look at you. What did you do?

00:42.819 --> 00:44.771
Look, Mommy. Look what I did.

00:44.831 --> 00:47.209
Mrs. Walker made us draw
pictures of ourselves.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.900
Oh? A self-portrait? Show Mommy.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.574
This is your picture?

00:56.718 --> 00:59.028
But... But it's a boy.

01:00.003 --> 01:01.350
I am a boy.

01:03.048 --> 01:04.547
Don't be silly.

01:04.607 --> 01:08.415
You are my little beautiful
Andrea, and you always will be.

01:11.046 --> 01:12.739
You can't hide what you are.

Oh. Look who decided to join us.

01:50.353 --> 01:52.061
Morning to you, too.

01:52.384 --> 01:54.514
Hey, how come you
don't shower with your cabin?

01:54.771 --> 01:57.367
I was out for a run this morning,
and I saw you leaving the bathroom.

01:57.427 --> 01:59.694
Why do you care? You got a crush?

02:02.491 --> 02:04.046
Any news on Amy?

02:04.186 --> 02:06.439
- Nothing.
- I'm sure she's fine.

02:06.499 --> 02:08.394
Really? You're a doctor now?

02:08.877 --> 02:11.305
"Friday the 13th Part VI."

02:11.809 --> 02:12.967
What?

02:13.249 --> 02:15.535
Jason gets hit by lightning
in the opening.

02:15.762 --> 02:17.187
Not only is he fine,

02:17.247 --> 02:19.829
but he comes back to life,
better than ever.

02:19.889 --> 02:23.792
Yes, because supernatural
monster rules apply to Amy.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.086
Anything?

02:29.061 --> 02:31.747
Yeah. I figured.

02:32.203 --> 02:34.049
Well, I've got mail.

02:35.123 --> 02:36.243
Blair...

02:37.257 --> 02:38.820
Jessie...

02:39.847 --> 02:40.947
and...

02:42.084 --> 02:43.854
What do I do with Blotter's?

02:44.649 --> 02:47.207
Do what he was gonna do... smoke it.

02:47.286 --> 02:48.476
Nice.

02:58.199 --> 03:02.349
Hey. Come on, you guys.
Enough moping around, all right?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.692
Look what I found.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.302
Summer of '83!

03:06.362 --> 03:09.854
- Summer of '83.
- Wow.

03:13.482 --> 03:16.143
Oh, no! Oh, man.

03:17.172 --> 03:19.656
Look at you. Wow.

03:19.716 --> 03:21.338
Cricket, so cute.

03:21.398 --> 03:22.743
Oh, I look

03:24.247 --> 03:25.355
Oh, what was her name again?

03:25.415 --> 03:29.659
Um, Andrea, and she was a total bitch.

03:29.719 --> 03:32.195
- She wasn't that bad.
- I don't remember her at all.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.197
She had pretty good taste in music.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.540
Wonder what happened to her.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.650
She's fine.

03:37.859 --> 03:40.236
Amy is fine.

03:40.296 --> 03:41.862
She's gonna make a full recovery.

03:42.755 --> 03:44.207
In fact, the doctor said

03:44.267 --> 03:45.675
she's well enough to come back to work.

03:45.735 --> 03:48.344
One day? After being hit by lightning.

03:48.404 --> 03:50.246
"Friday the 13th."

03:50.306 --> 03:53.545
Let's just welcome her back
with some camp spirit.

03:53.605 --> 03:55.343
I'm gonna push the schedule up a bit.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.617
Tonight will be the masquerade ball.

03:57.677 --> 04:00.141
All right, let's go make some masks.

04:09.691 --> 04:10.895
I'm not sure what a post ..

04:11.230 --> 04:12.952
-lightning strike
regimen should be,

04:13.012 --> 04:15.663
but my mom makes a mean
chocolate shake.

04:17.255 --> 04:18.387
Thanks.

04:18.447 --> 04:21.277
Vanilla? I knew I should've
gone vanilla.

04:21.337 --> 04:24.372
No. It's just... What is this?

04:25.301 --> 04:27.441
Forgotten bit of local history.

04:28.098 --> 04:31.345
A cult trying to summon
something from the lake?

04:31.530 --> 04:32.522
Dark history.

04:32.582 --> 04:34.682
It's just some research that I'm doing.

04:43.422 --> 04:44.501
What?

04:44.561 --> 04:47.437
Nothing. It's crazy.

04:47.497 --> 04:48.897
Tell me.

04:51.401 --> 04:55.236
When I got hit, right before
I fell in the lake,

04:55.371 --> 04:57.505
I think I saw a face.

04:58.044 --> 04:59.351
Like that.

05:01.839 --> 05:03.711
I told you it was crazy.

05:03.823 --> 05:06.514
No. You're just shook up.

05:06.637 --> 05:09.429
You didn't see this face. Or anything.

05:09.489 --> 05:11.161
- How do you know?
- Because crap like this

05:11.221 --> 05:12.662
doesn't actually happen
in the real world.

05:12.722 --> 05:14.822
Then why are you so interested
in all this?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.933
I'm interested in people
who would believe

05:16.993 --> 05:19.106
crap like this happens
in the real world.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.041
Anyone like that might be...

05:24.267 --> 05:25.275
You know what?

05:25.335 --> 05:27.077
How about you focus on your recovery,

05:27.137 --> 05:28.870
and I'll focus on the police work?

05:29.803 --> 05:32.239
Come on. Let's get you back to camp.

05:40.894 --> 05:43.217
Teacher wants us to check our work.

05:43.626 --> 05:45.728
Make sure we didn't miss anything.

05:45.788 --> 05:49.557
Sykes is on our ass. How we
gonna get back into camp?

05:50.404 --> 05:51.937
We'll find a way.

06:18.488 --> 06:21.389
You can't hide what you are.

06:24.356 --> 06:26.827
You can't hide what you are.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.921
Dry off...

06:54.240 --> 06:55.771
Andrea.

07:07.268 --> 07:08.602
Whatever you think you saw,

07:08.662 --> 07:10.404
you're not gonna say anything about it.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.897
And why is that?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.304
I found this lying around.

07:15.387 --> 07:17.511
Didn't know you had
a court date coming up.

07:17.571 --> 07:20.239
Does Deb know you lied about
that on your application?

07:20.574 --> 07:23.408
Are you threatening me, "Andrea"?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.812
Just making it clear
we both have a secret.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.715
You keep mine. I'll keep yours.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.518
And it's "Drew."

07:35.656 --> 07:38.214
I'd watch my back if I were you...

07:38.692 --> 07:40.092
Drew.

07:42.997 --> 07:45.097
- Wow.
- That's amazing.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.938
Ooh...   Check this out.

07:55.743 --> 07:59.678
Damn. She was always hot,
even in her crazy hippie getup.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.556
No!

08:02.616 --> 08:05.793
Oh, my God. That mask.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.286
What about it? Deb said it was
just an old piece of junk.

08:08.382 --> 08:10.622
Wait. You've seen it?

08:10.758 --> 08:13.024
Yeah. She had it in her cabin.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.173
What'd I miss?

08:19.233 --> 08:21.608
I think I'm losing my
mind. You remember my dream?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.377
Where you woke up and couldn't
find your boots?

08:23.437 --> 08:27.005
Those people in the woods,
doing a ritual, wearing masks?

08:28.660 --> 08:30.141
They looked like that.

08:30.586 --> 08:32.753
So what? It was a dream.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.623
Then why does Deb have one
of those masks in her cabin?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.982
And how come I
still can't find my boots?

09:07.545 --> 09:10.141
You can't hide what you are.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.053
You can't hide what you are.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.530
You can't hide what you are.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.989
Great news, sweetheart.
They had your size in yellow.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.369
Want to try it on?

09:43.772 --> 09:44.953
Sure, I guess.

09:51.121 --> 09:52.265
Sweetie?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.057
What's taking so long? Are you okay?

09:56.563 --> 09:57.759
Andrea?

10:00.797 --> 10:02.000
What is it?

10:04.507 --> 10:05.905
There's blood.

10:07.179 --> 10:08.407
Oh.

10:08.602 --> 10:10.073
It's okay, sweetheart.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.940
It's okay. It's a good thing.

10:16.685 --> 10:18.083
Congratulations.

10:18.466 --> 10:20.597
You are now a woman.

10:21.444 --> 10:24.295
This isn't supposed to
happen to me. I'm a boy.

10:26.579 --> 10:27.701
I thought we were over that.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.668
Mom! I'm a boy.

10:31.073 --> 10:32.193
You need help.

10:37.689 --> 10:38.830
Drew?

10:40.708 --> 10:43.217
Drew? Are you okay?

10:43.277 --> 10:45.552
I mean, why'd you run off
like that? What's wrong?

10:45.612 --> 10:47.279
Nothing. I just needed some air.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.521
In the bathroom?

10:48.581 --> 10:49.881
It was nothing.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.674
Look, I-I know that you're new
to camp and our traditions,

10:52.757 --> 10:56.024
but this masquerade ball
is actually kind of fun.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.407
Especially if you have a date.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.992
So...

11:00.693 --> 11:01.827
What do you say?

11:03.008 --> 11:05.504
You can't hide what you are.

11:07.795 --> 11:09.193
Drew?

11:09.648 --> 11:12.343
- What happened in the bathroom?
- He was just kind of...

11:12.681 --> 11:15.590
looking right through me,
and then he just bolted.

11:16.047 --> 11:19.441
Well, maybe he saw something, too.

11:20.015 --> 11:21.622
I mean, it has been going around.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.406
Now you're indulging this?

11:24.585 --> 11:26.960
My grandfather...

11:27.020 --> 11:29.586
I saw him the other night
through my window.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.698
But he died when I was 10.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.535
So you were thinking about your grandpa.

11:34.595 --> 11:36.504
And you were thinking about your friend.

11:36.630 --> 11:37.905
And you had a bad dream.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.908
It's more than that. It's this place.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.843
- What are you talking about?
- This lake.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.845
What if something is making
us see these things?

11:44.905 --> 11:47.628
- Y'all been smoking too much weed.
- I haven't smoked anything.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.234
I'm not supposed to say this,

11:52.713 --> 11:56.258
but Garrett's been
looking into it, he found stuff.

11:56.318 --> 11:58.925
There were all these crazy cultists
here a hundred years ago.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.465
A dreams is a dream. A lake is a lake.

12:01.525 --> 12:03.888
You guys are freaking yourselves
out over nothing.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.835
Hey, guys, I'm not going
in that lake anymore.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.871
Look what I found. This place is a dump.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.112
- Oh, my God.
- What?

12:15.669 --> 12:17.531
These are my boots.

12:19.637 --> 12:21.613
Well, we've had a
breakthrough, Mrs. Dalton,

12:21.673 --> 12:23.858
and your child wants
to share it with you.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.676
Okay, Andrea.

12:26.857 --> 12:28.168
I'm listening.

12:29.414 --> 12:31.367
That's just it. Um...

12:31.643 --> 12:33.904
I don't want you to
call me that anymore.

12:35.233 --> 12:36.921
I'm not Andrea.

12:39.228 --> 12:40.524
That's your name.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.792
No.

12:43.357 --> 12:44.890
My name is Drew.

12:45.970 --> 12:48.765
No. It's Andrea.

12:49.344 --> 12:52.377
Your father, rest his soul,
and I gave it to you.

12:52.437 --> 12:54.969
You gave it to me without knowing me.

12:56.074 --> 12:57.568
My name is Drew.

13:01.893 --> 13:03.688
- You're fired.
- Mrs. Dalton...

13:03.748 --> 13:06.466
How many thousands of
non-insurance-covered dollars

13:06.526 --> 13:08.226
have I given you
over the past five years?

13:08.286 --> 13:10.057
- We're done.
- Mom, please.

13:10.117 --> 13:11.596
Why are you doing this now?

13:11.656 --> 13:13.656
I can't pretend anymore.

13:13.988 --> 13:15.700
So you think you can
just choose your sex?

13:15.760 --> 13:17.550
You can just choose to be a boy?

13:17.629 --> 13:21.404
It's not a choice, Mom. I've
told you that a thousand times.

13:21.464 --> 13:23.708
I held you when you were
born. I raised you.

13:23.768 --> 13:25.277
You are a girl.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.711
I am a boy.

13:26.771 --> 13:28.271
Oh, please, Andrea.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.439
Drew.

13:29.658 --> 13:30.873
It's Drew.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.744
Can you say it? Just once?

13:36.581 --> 13:39.257
I-I'm still that baby
you held in your arms.

13:39.317 --> 13:41.451
This doesn't change that.

13:41.977 --> 13:44.026
You could be happy for me.

13:44.322 --> 13:46.963
Or you could... you
could love me for who I am.

13:47.941 --> 13:49.451
Who you are is Andrea.

13:51.151 --> 13:53.933
And as long as you're in
my house, you will be Andrea.

13:55.788 --> 13:57.629
That is who I gave birth to,

13:58.303 --> 14:00.403
and that's who you'll be
for the rest of your life.

14:05.269 --> 14:06.184
I just don't really see

14:06.244 --> 14:08.108
there being a logical
explanation for this.

14:08.168 --> 14:10.522
Well, there is no logical
explanation for it.

14:10.582 --> 14:11.989
It showed up on the shore.

14:12.049 --> 14:13.825
There's no way that it
couldn't have been,

14:13.885 --> 14:15.652
you know, just a dream.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.371
If my dream was real,
that means the mask was real,

14:19.662 --> 14:22.892
which means Deb might
not be who she says she is.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.069
- Deb? Really?
- Hey.

14:25.129 --> 14:26.829
She's the camp director.

14:27.190 --> 14:29.644
Satanists don't go around
advertising it.

14:29.704 --> 14:31.243
You're really starting
to sound like your mom.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.178
Deb is not Satanic.

14:33.238 --> 14:35.313
If she was, isn't Cricket right?

14:35.373 --> 14:37.540
Wouldn't she hide it? Exactly.

14:37.650 --> 14:40.263
How do we know she didn't put
something in Blotter's acid?

14:40.453 --> 14:41.719
Maybe she gave me the same thing

14:41.779 --> 14:43.509
so that I wouldn't remember my dream.

14:46.518 --> 14:47.639
What do you think?

14:56.129 --> 14:57.827
Drew? Drew!

14:58.762 --> 15:00.275
I'll be right back.

15:01.903 --> 15:03.666
I don't know what's going on here,

15:03.859 --> 15:05.761
but we need to find out more about her.

15:06.769 --> 15:08.150
I think I can help.

15:10.508 --> 15:12.542
Joel's camera.

15:12.729 --> 15:14.644
That's his personal footage.

15:16.912 --> 15:20.939
Mm. So sweet. So naive.

15:21.553 --> 15:24.678
So Joel's obsessed with Deb.
He films her all the time.

15:24.738 --> 15:27.062
Come on. Amy's right.
This is his private...

15:33.108 --> 15:35.531
Okay. What's up with the box?

15:35.697 --> 15:38.901
Not so sure. But in looking
through this stuff,

15:39.419 --> 15:41.500
seems like she brought
it back from the woods.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.499
What's in there?

15:48.260 --> 15:49.805
What the hell?

15:55.302 --> 15:56.728
What are you doing with my camera?

15:56.788 --> 15:58.445
Hang on. It's okay.

15:58.523 --> 15:59.831
No, this is not okay.

15:59.891 --> 16:01.824
I-It's not you, Joel.

16:02.278 --> 16:05.494
It's Deb. She's been... suspicious.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.170
Look, I know you like her,

16:07.230 --> 16:09.037
but how much do you really
know about her?

16:10.521 --> 16:11.751
You're wacked.

16:25.607 --> 16:27.515
You've never told anyone, have you?

16:29.840 --> 16:30.958
That you're gay.

16:32.763 --> 16:34.640
I get it. It's scary, but I...

16:34.700 --> 16:37.269
I'm here for you... to help you.

16:38.974 --> 16:40.276
What are you afraid of?

16:40.507 --> 16:42.710
Rejection. Disappointment.
Take your pick.

16:45.385 --> 16:46.773
Well, there's another look.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.551
Acceptance.

16:51.217 --> 16:53.751
Here. Check it out.

16:57.722 --> 16:58.838
Bowie?

17:00.398 --> 17:03.952
I always knew that I was... different.

17:04.719 --> 17:08.068
But... I never knew how to talk about it.

17:09.457 --> 17:12.288
But then I came to camp,
and I met someone.

17:14.766 --> 17:16.676
I didn't have to tell her I was gay.

17:18.268 --> 17:20.882
She just understood
that I was different.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.367
And her response was
to give me that tape.

17:26.430 --> 17:29.252
Bowie lives how he wants to live.

17:29.312 --> 17:32.810
He does what he wants, and he
doesn't care what people think.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.672
Listening to Bowie gave me
the courage to come out.

17:39.565 --> 17:41.633
And everyone just accepted you?

17:41.693 --> 17:42.901
Of course not.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.724
But Cricket did.

17:46.642 --> 17:48.812
She was the first person I told, and...

17:49.843 --> 17:51.105
that was enough.

17:54.969 --> 17:56.385
Knowing that

17:56.445 --> 17:59.626
there's just one person
out there who supported me...

18:00.278 --> 18:04.449
it... it gave me the strength
to face everyone else.

18:06.298 --> 18:08.094
Be my date to the masquerade ball.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.410
You can trust me.

18:10.655 --> 18:11.984
I accept you.

18:14.288 --> 18:15.609
No matter what.

18:20.726 --> 18:21.827
Okay.

18:24.004 --> 18:25.346
Well, think about it.

18:25.674 --> 18:27.904
I'm here for you, whenever you're ready.

18:39.069 --> 18:40.821
How was that midday shower today?

18:41.376 --> 18:42.452
What do you want?

18:42.512 --> 18:43.841
I go running every day.

18:44.385 --> 18:46.493
Love to clear my head out in nature.

18:47.020 --> 18:50.227
And I always come across
the most beautiful sights.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.831
So you know what I did?

18:52.044 --> 18:55.759
I took Joel's camera to record
some of that beauty.

18:56.060 --> 18:58.825
It's really incredible
what you can see out here...

18:58.885 --> 19:02.538
loons skimming the lake,
elks feeding on grass...

19:03.392 --> 19:05.820
freaks taking secret showers.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.469
Why are you doing this?
I thought we had a deal.

19:08.529 --> 19:10.893
Yeah. You thought that.

19:11.252 --> 19:13.260
I told you to watch your back.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.757
We have a problem. Joel was
chatting up Deb again.

19:23.817 --> 19:26.464
I heard him say he was gonna meet
her at her cabin after the ball starts.

19:26.524 --> 19:27.713
What is he doing?

19:27.991 --> 19:31.069
I don't know. But we got
to save him from himself.

19:31.147 --> 19:33.234
Her box. We got to get it.

19:33.294 --> 19:36.023
She's clearly hiding
something. Maybe the answer's in there.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.252
Or we call in real help... Sykes.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.464
Yeah, you go call your boyfriend.

19:40.799 --> 19:42.107
We're not waiting around.

19:42.261 --> 19:43.436
Come on.

19:55.207 --> 19:56.396
Drew!

19:57.353 --> 19:58.490
You're leaving?

19:58.906 --> 20:00.465
Is it because you're freaked out?

20:00.525 --> 20:02.219
Because you're not alone.

20:02.546 --> 20:04.027
You're not the only one seeing things.

20:04.087 --> 20:05.823
You can talk to us. We understand.

20:06.817 --> 20:08.251
No, you don't.

20:11.946 --> 20:13.274
Good night, Mom.

20:13.407 --> 20:14.789
Good night, Andrea.

21:07.011 --> 21:08.188
Andrea?

21:08.248 --> 21:09.919
You didn't tell me you got an "A"...

21:11.503 --> 21:12.712
Andrea?

21:48.663 --> 21:50.360
Want to dance, Deputy?

21:50.420 --> 21:51.564
Jessie?

21:52.385 --> 21:53.326
Come on.

21:53.386 --> 21:54.536
I, um...

21:54.606 --> 21:56.402
I'm here on... on business.

21:56.462 --> 21:57.401
Business? What business?

21:57.461 --> 21:59.199
There you are. Come with me.

21:59.259 --> 22:01.517
Drew... He's so
freaked out, he's leaving camp.

22:01.577 --> 22:03.505
Please. He's leaving
because nobody likes him.

22:03.565 --> 22:05.997
Really, Jessie? Do you always
have to judge everyone?

22:06.057 --> 22:07.426
Do you have to be everyone's friend?

22:07.486 --> 22:09.464
You used to be
everyone's friend, too, Jessie.

22:15.031 --> 22:18.151
Cricket and Alex are in Deb's
cabin. We got to go.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.228
What's Deb got to do with this?

22:19.288 --> 22:20.848
You know how you
told me you were worried

22:20.908 --> 22:23.548
about people in this world
who believe crazy crap?

22:28.925 --> 22:30.919
Hey, it's okay.

22:47.420 --> 22:48.665
Deb, Deb, Deb, Deb, Deb.

23:10.575 --> 23:11.907
Right on time.

23:16.838 --> 23:18.016
Okay.

23:19.971 --> 23:21.779
Uh, are you gonna show me?

23:33.605 --> 23:34.561
Open it.

23:34.621 --> 23:35.915
Come with me.

24:01.599 --> 24:03.903
Relax. I come in peace.

24:07.799 --> 24:09.031
That tape I had of you?

24:09.091 --> 24:11.771
I never had it. I
made the whole thing up.

24:13.377 --> 24:14.551
You pushed me.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.454
I was scared.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.761
But I was never gonna tell
the other counselors

24:21.821 --> 24:24.137
about your letter. Really?

24:25.575 --> 24:26.766
Yeah.

24:34.671 --> 24:36.687
You and me, we're kind of the same, huh?

24:37.953 --> 24:39.214
Both scared.

24:39.841 --> 24:42.798
You're scared of Deb finding
out about your DUI?

24:46.964 --> 24:48.355
The DUI...

24:51.734 --> 24:53.131
It's complicated.

24:54.644 --> 24:55.841
There are...

24:58.505 --> 25:01.176
Um, you know what?
It's just one part of it.

25:02.087 --> 25:03.438
What else happened?

25:04.654 --> 25:07.484
Let's just say I spent my life
trusting the wrong people.

25:11.396 --> 25:13.215
Are you really gonna take the bus?

25:14.961 --> 25:16.845
You came back here for a reason.

25:17.718 --> 25:18.856
Why?

25:20.645 --> 25:22.206
You loved it, didn't you?

25:25.009 --> 25:26.592
Yeah. I don't know.

25:26.652 --> 25:28.871
Look, it was so long ago,
I don't even really remember.

25:28.931 --> 25:30.171
Well, I loved it, too.

25:33.208 --> 25:35.467
Probably for the same reasons you did.

25:40.503 --> 25:44.220
My... home life sucked.

25:45.364 --> 25:47.278
And I'm guessing yours did, too.

25:50.044 --> 25:54.106
Look, when I was a kid,
um... camp was the only place

25:54.166 --> 25:58.334
where I was never
scared, where I could be myself.

26:01.562 --> 26:04.072
You know you can, right?

26:06.213 --> 26:07.354
You don't get it.

26:07.414 --> 26:09.130
Like, I'm not trying to hide who I am.

26:09.190 --> 26:11.039
I'm try... I'm trying to be who I am.

26:11.099 --> 26:13.649
I'm not talking... I'm not
talking about being "Drew."

26:13.709 --> 26:17.297
I'm talking about being a
jerk. I remember you, Drew.

26:17.782 --> 26:22.591
This... cool, aloof, like,
holier-than-thou guy?

26:22.651 --> 26:24.374
That's not the kid from '83.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.335
Thought you said I was a bitch.

26:26.395 --> 26:29.442
To me. You short-sheeted
my bed, remember?

26:29.518 --> 26:32.167
Mm. Well, you were an easy target.

26:34.001 --> 26:35.770
I can't make you come back.

26:38.213 --> 26:39.343
But...

26:41.079 --> 26:42.340
I hope you do.

26:58.719 --> 26:59.764
What is it?

26:59.824 --> 27:01.987
It's Joel. Deb was leading
him into the woods.

27:02.047 --> 27:03.760
Okay. Everyone take it easy.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.589
Back to the party. I got this.

27:12.725 --> 27:14.005
Thank you.

27:14.076 --> 27:15.431
It's all right.

27:15.491 --> 27:17.495
I know it sounds crazy,
Deb being involved...

27:17.555 --> 27:19.047
I don't know if Deb's involved or not.

27:19.249 --> 27:21.507
But I do know
something is going on here.

27:22.087 --> 27:23.289
Now, get back.

27:25.284 --> 27:26.236
What do you know?

27:26.296 --> 27:28.109
- Amy, please...
- No, you know something.

27:28.664 --> 27:30.554
The map, that
journal you've been reading...

27:30.614 --> 27:31.945
They all mean something.

27:32.475 --> 27:34.719
What are these
crazy people trying to do?

27:36.319 --> 27:38.598
The best that I can piece together, I...

27:40.665 --> 27:42.618
They're trying to awaken
some sort of demon.

27:43.886 --> 27:45.891
But I worry less about
crazy people's motives

27:45.951 --> 27:47.167
than I do about stopping them.

27:47.227 --> 27:49.413
You ever think it's possible...

27:50.768 --> 27:54.223
that maybe some of it could be real?

27:56.442 --> 27:58.236
I don't rule out anything, Amy.

27:58.296 --> 28:00.453
But I don't let the ghost
stories scare me.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.742
Does anything scare you?

28:03.127 --> 28:04.656
People who believe them.

28:05.159 --> 28:08.146
Now, go back to the party.
I'll find Joel.

28:20.997 --> 28:23.224
Deb, why are you bringing me out here?

28:24.023 --> 28:25.331
Turn off the camera.

28:48.677 --> 28:50.152
You wanted to know the truth?

29:22.341 --> 29:23.717
"Dharma Bums"?

29:24.458 --> 29:27.129
It was given to me by someone
I loved very much.

29:28.019 --> 29:31.154
I wanted to share it with you
because you remind me of him.

29:32.599 --> 29:33.961
He taught me a lot.

29:35.292 --> 29:37.277
Said, um...

29:37.888 --> 29:40.857
"Life is a series of moments,

29:40.917 --> 29:43.519
moments that don't happen to you

29:44.260 --> 29:46.414
but moments that, if you are...

29:47.646 --> 29:51.658
brave enough... you can create."

31:52.492 --> 31:53.883
What the hell is this?

31:53.943 --> 31:56.358
Honey, we need to talk.

31:56.991 --> 31:59.737
I brought Dr. Martin in to help.

32:00.860 --> 32:03.579
I was... I was wrong to fire her.

32:04.058 --> 32:05.545
We need help.

32:06.309 --> 32:07.460
I'm wearing a skirt.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.358
I mean, everything is fine, right?

32:09.891 --> 32:11.848
Everything is far from fine.

32:12.084 --> 32:15.148
Listen to your mother.
She has something to say.

32:15.208 --> 32:17.425
What? What could she
possibly have to say?

32:17.522 --> 32:19.533
Last night, I know you snuck out.

32:20.734 --> 32:23.041
I went into your room,
you weren't there,

32:23.537 --> 32:24.755
and I followed you.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.291
I saw you.

32:28.730 --> 32:31.009
I saw you... Drew.

32:35.209 --> 32:36.520
What did you call me?

32:36.602 --> 32:39.754
Your name. It's Drew.

32:40.454 --> 32:41.724
I know that now.

32:46.476 --> 32:47.847
You're a boy.

32:50.137 --> 32:51.978
You are a boy.

32:56.291 --> 32:57.919
I'm sorry.

33:00.028 --> 33:01.890
I'm so sorry.

33:28.523 --> 33:30.164
You want to get out of here?

34:04.652 --> 34:05.819
Garrett!

34:41.467 --> 34:42.672
Hey!

34:47.547 --> 34:49.045
Amy?

34:51.851 --> 34:53.217
Amy.

35:08.769 --> 35:10.001
Amy.

35:13.874 --> 35:16.550
Amy.

35:16.610 --> 35:18.843
What's going on?

35:45.372 --> 35:46.530
What...

35:48.373 --> 35:49.820
What happened?

36:01.174 --> 36:02.947
The teacher's gonna be happy.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.665
Uh... I... I have to go.

36:14.725 --> 36:16.822
To... To the bathroom.

36:34.276 --> 36:36.144
Hey, Mom, I'm home.

36:40.944 --> 36:42.131
Mom?

37:25.893 --> 37:27.078
"I'm sorry, Drew.

37:28.648 --> 37:30.350
I accept that's who you are.

37:30.900 --> 37:34.161
But I can't accept that my
daughter Andrea wasn't real.

37:34.610 --> 37:35.831
She was.

37:36.381 --> 37:37.713
And now she's gone.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.839
I miss her with all my heart.

37:42.081 --> 37:45.915
And seeing you every day
is a reminder of what I lost.

37:47.225 --> 37:48.594
It's too much.

37:50.979 --> 37:53.038
I hope one day you'll understand."

38:08.462 --> 38:10.122
Enough!

38:16.952 --> 38:18.951
Hey, is everything okay?

38:23.701 --> 38:25.197
Do you... Do you remember
when you told me

38:25.257 --> 38:27.338
you felt like we knew each other before?

38:28.639 --> 38:30.110
We did.

38:32.657 --> 38:35.551
This tape that... that you gave me?

38:35.842 --> 38:38.538
I gave it to you six years ago.

38:39.686 --> 38:42.272
No, Andrea gave me that tape.

38:42.332 --> 38:45.524
Th-That's right. That...
That's what you knew me as.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.365
Mm...

38:52.425 --> 38:54.592
What?

38:54.990 --> 38:56.180
It was me.

38:56.578 --> 38:59.010
But ..  I wasn't Andrea. I was Drew.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.585
I'm sorry. Are you crazy?

39:01.891 --> 39:03.840
No, no. No, I'm not crazy.

39:04.471 --> 39:06.242
Look, I... I needed you to know.

39:09.230 --> 39:10.747
So you're...

39:13.497 --> 39:14.648
Who are you?

39:15.237 --> 39:18.048
This is who I am.

39:18.618 --> 39:20.792
So, Andrea's gone?

39:20.852 --> 39:23.320
No. No, there was never an Andrea.

39:23.380 --> 39:25.563
This is who I always was.

39:26.910 --> 39:29.663
Look, you... you said
you could accept me,

39:29.881 --> 39:31.553
no matter what, and...

39:32.565 --> 39:33.685
Blair...

39:37.871 --> 39:40.337
Blair!
