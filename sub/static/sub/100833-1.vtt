00:30.113 --> 00:32.729
Hey, what's upвЂќ? How you doing?

00:42.084 --> 00:44.325
Hey, could you pick me up, please?

00:45.337 --> 00:46.793
Like, now?

01:01.353 --> 01:03.389
How was the movie?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.141
I'm sorry, okay?

01:05.232 --> 01:06.597
Yeah, get in.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.155
Hey.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.862
You know, when I was your age,

01:18.954 --> 01:23.493
I barfed all over grandma's favorite
shag carpet in the guest bathroom.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.370
I told her it was bad shellfish.

01:25.460 --> 01:30.079
But, actually, I downed half a bottle
of peppermint schnapps

01:30.173 --> 01:33.165
behind sweetie pie's with my friends.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.500
So come on.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.839
Zach and I broke up.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.049
Oh, my god.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.260
- Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
- No, don't do any of that.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.469
It's just...

01:45.564 --> 01:48.351
He started talking about
Japan and how it's too far

01:48.442 --> 01:50.353
and that I shouldn't do
the program next year.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.524
That's not cool.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.943
What?

01:53.030 --> 01:55.612
Mom, you just have no idea
what I'm going through, ever.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.529
Maybe he's right.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.404
Maybe I shouldn't go.
It's not like I speak the language.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.826
Don't know anyone else who's going.
Why am I even going?

02:01.913 --> 02:05.076
- When I was in high school...
- No, mom, this isn't the sweetie pie's, okay?

02:05.167 --> 02:08.157
- Things are, like, a lot more stressful now.
- Yeah, you'd be surprised.

02:08.252 --> 02:11.211
- Sit down, I'll tell you a story.
- I'm gonna go to bed. I'm tired.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.334
You're just gonna stare
at your phone all night.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.915
So then why can't you just text me?

02:15.927 --> 02:18.339
Sit your butt down.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.220
It was the early '80s...

02:25.312 --> 02:27.428
No, please, not the '80s.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.229
Yes, the '80s in the San Fernando valley.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.523
And me and my friends...

02:31.610 --> 02:34.443
Were valley girls.
I know, you've told me a thousand times.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.769
- Mmm.
- You guys were all like:

02:35.864 --> 02:38.276
"Oh, my god. Like, where's my brain?"

02:38.367 --> 02:41.029
Yup. And we actually used words
like "tripendicular,"

02:41.119 --> 02:44.031
and we wore teal eyeliner
and popped collars.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.956
And we hung out
at the mall every night.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.079
Wow. Deep.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.333
Okay, so we weren't exactly
solving world hunger.

02:53.423 --> 02:57.211
But at the time, it seemed perfect.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.674
Life was like a pop song.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.178
And we knew all the words.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.014
J; See the people walking down the street j

04:56.713 --> 04:58.499
That's how I remember it.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.955
That's what it felt like.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.961
God, that's so cringy.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.384
We lived in a total bubble.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.211
We never left the valley.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.171
We barely left the mall.

05:08.266 --> 05:13.431
We were warned to never go over the hill
where all the weirdos lived.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.763
Punks and runaways.

05:15.857 --> 05:21.568
It was just a few zip codes over,
but seemed like a million miles away.

playing our five shitty songs.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.485
And then he was all like, "call me, babe."
And I was like, "Rob!"

06:53.580 --> 06:54.865
- My god.
- I'm so sure.

06:54.956 --> 06:55.786
Oh, my god.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.411
But you said you wanted to call him.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.868
Duh. Like, she totally does,
but she can't act like she does.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.455

07:14.351 --> 07:16.137
I've got a radical idea.

Let's blow. I mean, we could go anywhere.

07:19.064 --> 07:19.894
I ike another mall?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.596
No. Like, get on the first bus we see.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.478
We could, like, go over the hill,
to Hollywood or something.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.605
Or we could just, like,
see where it takes us.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.988
- You're freaking me out!
- Oh.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.491

members of the faculty

09:10.050 --> 09:12.792
suggested we shouldn't have a pep rally
for one person.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.716

10:46.980 --> 10:49.266
I just can't decide
who I wanna take me, Mike or Danny.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.313
Danny has the bod, but
his brains are bad news.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.891
He's going to Cal state northridge.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.851
Like, we're going to northridge?

10:57.490 --> 11:00.573

You're set for life with Mickey.

I'm so sure.
I mean, people are waiting now, you know?

11:05.415 --> 11:08.248
Some girls don't even get married
until they're, like, 23 and stuff.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.450
If I'm not married by 23, I'll kill myself.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.127
But I'm not even sure what
I wanna do with my life.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.670
Yeah, that's why you get married.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.964
So you don't have to do anything.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.669
Yeah, like, once the divorce is final,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.004
- Well, what does she like to do?
- Be married.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.682
Don't bring up your mom's divorce.
It makes me really sad.

11:26.769 --> 11:27.929

11:28.771 --> 11:32.389

So, I totally stole my
mom's joy of sex book.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.629
Did you see those illustrations?

14:22.653 --> 14:23.688
It was so gross.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.068
Yeah, I'd like to hear more about this
book. Wasn't on my summer reading list.

14:27.158 --> 14:31.492
Like, I could totally give you
a full report tonight at my friend's party.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.571
- 1807 Sierra vista heights.
- Loryn.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.752
No. Get out. Like, go.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.922
No

14:46.010 --> 14:47.010
Shoo

14:51.599 --> 14:55.308
sorry about my buddy there.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.885
He can be a real dick.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.220
Yeah. He's, like, way rude.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.351
He does this all the time.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.307
Hi. We were all just leaving.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.939
Like, now.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.894
Yeah.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.236
- Hey, wait! What's your name?
- Hook me up with those 'chos

15:14.330 --> 15:16.787
and I'll tell you where the val' chicks
are going tonight.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.115
Dude, a bird was just all over those.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.825
Wicked.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.581
Wait, back up.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.913
You just left?

15:25.007 --> 15:26.338
Well, I had a boyfriend.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.132
Who was a total tool.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.084
And he had all those tattoos.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.842
I mean, he was actually considered pretty,
you know, edgy back then.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.891
You have instant chemistry with this
crazy hot guy and you just bailed?

15:36.978 --> 15:39.469
If you'll let me finish.
You were afraid of his tattoos?

15:39.564 --> 15:41.100
You know, I'm so tired.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.273
Maybe you should just go
text all your friends. No.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.194
I mean, you can keep going.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.772
If you talk more about him and not about...

15:51.784 --> 15:54.150
Like, leg warmers.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.530
Okay.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.986
No leg warmers.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.742
I promise.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.705
Now, take it forward.
Take it, one, two, three.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.036
- Now, side to side.
- Mom?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.588
- Huh?
- Have you ever, like, thought

16:07.675 --> 16:11.418
something was totally right
that it should, like, fit just perfectly,

16:11.512 --> 16:13.924
but then it just totally doesn'tвЂќ?

16:14.015 --> 16:21.012
Ooh. Well, I guess, that kind of depends
on what you're trying to fit where.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.689
You know? I mean,
sometimes things aren't meant to...

16:25.693 --> 16:28.355
- Be put in certain...
- Oh, my, god!

16:28.446 --> 16:30.778
- Experimenting is fun. It's exciting.
- Ew! Mom!

16:30.865 --> 16:33.277
- Hello, ladies. Look at what I got.
- Oh, my god.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.367
I ook at that!

16:34.410 --> 16:36.742
Look at this new technology.
Ll ook at how sleek it is.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.319
- Wow.
- There's a whole vcr in here.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.779
I ook how small that is.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.240
It's burning hot to the touch,
but I think that's normal.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.701
We could make our own workout video.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.377
- Honey, we can make all kinds of videos.
- Ooh.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.205
No, stop, guys.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.336
Oh, Julie richman.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.507
American teenage qirl...

16:52.595 --> 16:54.881
- Stop, dad.
- Of the valley variety.

16:54.972 --> 17:00.057
But what is she working on right now?
Is it another world-famous fashion project?

17:00.144 --> 17:03.056
My outfit for Mickey's costume party.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.478
For what party?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.851
No. I mean, are his parents gonna be there?

17:06.943 --> 17:08.252
- No risky business?
- Yes.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.394
His parents will be there.
They even got it catered.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.069
Well, that sounds classy.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.361
Kamikazes!

17:18.371 --> 17:21.238
You know, it's very
important to stay hydrated.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.914
I know this because I'm a mom.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.662
Yeah I'm a mother.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.891
You remember the Halloween
that we made those Houdini costumes?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.094
Yeah, with the handcuffs.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.520
You guys are so lucky
I rescued you in middle school.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.768
- Especially you, Stacey.
- Oh.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.858

18:10.673 --> 18:11.879

Hell, yeah. You're smoking too, babe.

We're young. We're still figuring that out.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.482
Good evening, my liege.

21:22.573 --> 21:23.653
Hey, Casper.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.026
Hey.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.449
- Oh, are you Elliott from e. 7.7
- I am.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.571
I love that movie!

21:28.662 --> 21:30.653
I know. I mean, uh...

21:30.748 --> 21:34.787
- Is it attached to your butt?
- No. It's more of, I'd say, the groin area.

21:34.877 --> 21:35.877
Oh.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.411
I mean, not... it wasn't...
I'm Princess Diana.

21:38.506 --> 21:39.962
You look great. Thanks.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.255
You know, I really like her.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.754
I know she's not a blood Princess.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.300
I know that it's by marriage.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.387
- I still...
- Hey!

21:46.472 --> 21:47.962
- Are you a fish?
- Uh...

21:48.057 --> 21:50.218
Because, son, you're going for a swim!

21:51.936 --> 21:54.177
- That was amazing.
- Are you okay?

21:54.271 --> 21:55.977
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.147
L... do you wanna come in?

21:58.234 --> 22:00.441
I can't. I borrowed my Nana's wig.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.542
> I could feel at the time j

22:19.547 --> 22:23.005
Jules, you won't believe
what just happened!

22:23.092 --> 22:24.957
Danny was all bragging
about his new Porsche.

22:25.052 --> 22:28.044
I was ripping him hard,
saying he wouldn't take that thing over 90,

22:28.138 --> 22:29.969
and he was, like, "I'm so sure.вЂќ

22:30.057 --> 22:32.389
So I'm, like, "okay, prove it, dude.вЂќ

22:32.476 --> 22:34.888
So we take this thing out to the street.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.061
He gets it to, like, 50, wimps out.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.763
So he starts doing doughnuts
and then he throws up.

22:39.859 --> 22:44.319
And then, I was, like, "there's no way you're
getting that puke out of the glove box."

22:44.405 --> 22:46.987
You're not even listening.
вЂњWhat?

22:47.074 --> 22:49.486
Are you listening to me? Yeah uh

22:49.577 --> 22:52.034
he puked in his glove box?

22:53.330 --> 22:54.911
Who's that douchebag?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.326
I don't know.

22:57.418 --> 23:01.661
Okay, well, I think you really need
to see this for yourself.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.417
Man, these high school guys blow.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.594
Oh, my god. Totally.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.388
Pretty good with that pump.
Maybe you can show me

23:17.479 --> 23:19.344
- what else you're good at.
- Oh. Gee.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.055
You're not really my type, cro-mag.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.232
I'm every girl's type, babe.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.777
Let's just say you don't
have the right equipment.

23:28.866 --> 23:29.866
Shut up, dude.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.616
Dyke alert.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.569
Dyke alert!

23:36.415 --> 23:37.245
What?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.164
Say that again. Say that again!

23:39.251 --> 23:40.787
Frankie says relax.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.038
Hey, hey, hey!

23:42.129 --> 23:43.289
Back up!

23:43.380 --> 23:45.587

- Hey, hey!

23:45.674 --> 23:47.710
Get these guys out of here, man!

23:51.305 --> 23:54.217

clocked by Daisy Duke.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.730

Yo, dude.

camp friends were wrong.

Oops.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.583
You looking for someone out there?

Hey, open up!

25:32.364 --> 25:33.979
So do you, like, live around here?

25:34.074 --> 25:35.735
Not exactly.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.739
Come on, man. Hurry up in there.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.164
- Wanna get out of here?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.366
Kill let's motor.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.417
Wait. As if.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.832
Like, I just met you.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.459
And this is Mickey's party.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.383

25:54.470 --> 25:57.212
This is Mickey's party? Shh.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.093
Well, I mean, where would you wanna go?

26:04.188 --> 26:05.188
Anywhere.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.347
What would you wanna do?

26:09.735 --> 26:11.100
Anything.

26:14.323 --> 26:15.563
Oh, god. I don't know.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.987
Mickey, all of my friends, everybody would
probably have a total cow if I left.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.160
Forget them.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.283
What do you wanna do?

These are the kids
they warn us about in life skills class.

Come on. вЂњJules.

27:52.296 --> 27:58.758
j you kept it going till the sun fell down

Hollywood, kiss my ass!

28:05.684 --> 28:06.969
Yeah!

28:14.776 --> 28:16.437
Hey, speedy, you got my money?

28:28.582 --> 28:30.368
- Come on.
- I'm not getting out here.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.701
Okay, but when they attack
the car, save the radio.

28:33.795 --> 28:34.955
Jules!

28:38.425 --> 28:39.505
Whoa.

sorry.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.196
Wait, shouldn't somebody stop that fight?

29:45.284 --> 29:46.284
It's called dancing!

29:46.368 --> 29:48.450
Hardly. Like, what's the point?

29:48.537 --> 29:49.652
Pointlessness!

29:50.831 --> 29:52.822
J nothing left to bring me back j

29:52.916 --> 29:54.656
amazing, right?

29:54.751 --> 29:57.868
I don't know. It's kind of weird.

29:57.963 --> 30:01.626
It's just authentic. But I guess
you don't get that in the valley.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.423
I like the valley.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.252
You think you like the
valley, but it's empty.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.132
You dress alike, you talk the same.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.465
Oh, my god. You guys
totally dress the same.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.721
Maybe you need to get out of Hollywood.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.389
So when can I see you again?

30:21.111 --> 30:24.524
Aren't you supposed to wait
till the end of the night to ask me that?

30:24.614 --> 30:25.614
Why?

30:26.575 --> 30:29.191
Julie. What about Mickey?

30:31.663 --> 30:34.370
- I think you're having a mental breakdown.
- Oh, my god.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.563
- Just a little bit longer, please?
- L. Ook around us.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.919
People have holes where
they're not supposed to.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.668
- Please?
- I got stabbed with that kid's hair.

30:43.759 --> 30:47.718
Obviously, you, like, wanna
be here, but I don't.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.544
I'm calling a cab!

30:49.639 --> 30:51.300
Are you gonna be able to get home okay?

30:51.391 --> 30:53.973
I got a 1420 on my sat, Jules.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.723
I think I can get myself back to encino.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.603
Hello, you Hollywood urchins!

31:02.694 --> 31:05.561

You know, like, hang out.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.936
Yeah.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.901
But what are you into? Um

33:10.989 --> 33:16.359
I don't know.
Like, my friends and shopping and, like...

33:18.663 --> 33:22.497
I can't believe
that this is happening. This is, like...

33:23.627 --> 33:25.413
It's wild.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.812
I really have to go.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.320
People just leave their stuff out?

33:54.407 --> 33:58.400
Yeah. It's, like, the valley.
Nobody steals things.

33:58.495 --> 34:00.360
That's what you think.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.821
I'm shoving that bike in my trunk.

34:24.938 --> 34:27.600
- Jules?
- Uh, yeah?

34:28.650 --> 34:29.650
You up?

34:31.735 --> 34:33.101
Yeah, I am now.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.938
Mickey's on his way. I'll
go fix you some tang.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.693
Thanks.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.989
Mickey.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.867
So are you going to win
us another championship?

34:44.958 --> 34:48.291
Yes, ma'am. We're gonna cream tarzana.
You don't have to call me ma'am.

34:48.378 --> 34:52.041
I'm barely old enough to be a cool babysitter
that you used to have a thing for.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.839
Hey, there's my qirl!

34:54.926 --> 34:57.292
Go get them, little mcenroe.

34:57.387 --> 35:00.675
- I'm gonna win it for you, all right?
- Oh.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.177
Okay. Let's hit it.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.599
Mickey.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.721
- We need to talk.
- Come on, babe, it's the championship.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.305
Mickey, I can't do this anymore.

35:11.735 --> 35:14.943
Look, we all had too much fun last night.

35:15.030 --> 35:18.147
I got mega drunk, you left
without saying goodbye.

35:18.241 --> 35:21.028
Yeah? It's all good. We both feel terrible.

35:21.119 --> 35:21.983
No, no.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.036
I just think we, like, don't
want the same things.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.996
Oh.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.454
Is this about.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.420
Prom night?

35:38.511 --> 35:40.172
Hey. It's normal to be nervous, okay?

35:40.263 --> 35:43.221
But I promise, it's gonna be special.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.343
Mickey...

35:44.434 --> 35:47.676
- Now, come on, let's roll.
- Mickey, that's not what I was talking about.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.136
I need to talk to you.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.516
Talk to me in the car. Let's go.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.728
What's going on with you?

35:58.823 --> 36:00.313
I'm trying to figure it out.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.775
But I don't wanna, like,
be your cheering squad.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.031
You're not even a cheerleader.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.201
We're over.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.380
Big mistake, Julie.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.048
Big mistake!

36:19.135 --> 36:21.467
And way to get me out of
my zone for the match.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.044
Not cool at alll

36:24.057 --> 36:27.595
big mistake!

36:47.831 --> 36:51.449
You do know if you cared about our band
half as much as you care about that ramen,

36:51.543 --> 36:53.875
we'd be, like, really rich right now?

36:53.962 --> 36:56.795
Oh, I'm sorry. You don't want some?

36:56.881 --> 36:58.542
No, I want the ramen.

36:58.633 --> 37:02.046
We're still gonna practice,
though, later, right?

37:08.727 --> 37:10.183
The office of Randall j. Phillips.

37:11.521 --> 37:12.761
Well, hello.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.222
This is Julie richman returning his call.

37:15.316 --> 37:19.184
I'd like to schedule an
appointment, like, asap.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.315
Well, I'm just looking at
his schedule right now,

37:21.406 --> 37:25.069
and it would appear he's free forever.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.568
No. And she just, like, dumped Mickey?
Yes yes

37:29.914 --> 37:31.529
don't worry. Stacey's on it.

37:31.624 --> 37:32.955
Oh, my god, Jules.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.828

37:34.919 --> 37:36.659

- Knees up.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.921
- We don't date guys like that.
- Does he know how to play tennis?

37:44.012 --> 37:45.798
- No, but it's just like...
- Here we go.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.255

- To the right!

freak out senior year.

- Oh, my god. I'm not freaking out.

J my need to possess you j

40:38.686 --> 40:41.678
Julie thinks she's, like,
way too cool for us now.

40:41.773 --> 40:42.683
No. You think?

40:42.774 --> 40:45.186
What, she likes this guy
because he's different?

40:45.276 --> 40:46.607
Different from who?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.402
Hey, can we not talk about Julie?

40:51.866 --> 40:53.322
Yeah, you're right.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.534
Let's just have fun tonight.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.703
I you are an obsession j

41:02.794 --> 41:04.830
what? Mickey and Karen hooked up?

41:04.921 --> 41:06.206
I know. Crazy, right?

41:06.297 --> 41:08.379
I get that you didn't want
him anymore, but still.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.706
Right? Thank you.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.507
Okay, first of all, she's the skank.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.927
Well, I'm ambivalent about that word.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.300
- But, yes.
- Okay, well, were you freaking out about it?

41:17.392 --> 41:21.351
Well, at the time, I was
a little preoccupied.

41:26.734 --> 41:27.894
Ooh, la, la.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.318
French restaurant? Fancy.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.270
At least we know he has good taste.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.026
Mom, what do you even know about France?

41:34.117 --> 41:37.484
Nothing, I guess. I
just always wanted to go.

41:38.621 --> 41:39.451
Okay. Bye.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.495
Just going to dinner and
a movie with this boy?

41:41.582 --> 41:43.197
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:43.292 --> 41:46.455
- And, um, you'll be home by midnight?
- Yes, mom.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.958
Sorry. It's important to your father.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.048
Okay.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.547
- Mwah.
- Love you.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.669
I love you too.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.875
Bye.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.093
Just say no.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.887
- To what?
- Everything.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.995
J I saw your eyes j

43:01.537 --> 43:03.073
j of the new regime j

43:03.164 --> 43:07.032

43:07.126 --> 43:11.039

X even played once. X?

43:26.145 --> 43:27.726
- Yeah, the band.
- Yeah, the band. Heh.

43:27.814 --> 43:31.102
Oh, sorry, did you not know
anything at all about music? I...

43:32.110 --> 43:33.725
Not punk music.

43:33.820 --> 43:35.560
So why don't you tell me?

43:35.655 --> 43:39.364
Oh. Okay, well, for starters, punk is dead.

43:41.035 --> 43:44.243
Well, I'm sure
the dead band is gonna be totally bitchen,

43:44.330 --> 43:45.445
but I have curfew.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.531
But you're gonna miss your
one-week anniversary.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.991
- That's a big record for this guy. Ow.
- Hey, shut up.

43:51.379 --> 43:54.792
Well, we can celebrate another time,
but I have to get home.

43:54.882 --> 43:57.339
- My parents are, like, gonna kill me.
- I'll take you home.

43:57.426 --> 43:59.780
- I'm not gonna make you leave.
- I'm not putting you on a bus

43:59.804 --> 44:01.886
on Hollywood boulevard. A bus?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.634
Not. I'll totally cab it.

44:03.724 --> 44:07.433
Like, why stop thereвЂќ?
Why not a stretch limo?

44:08.396 --> 44:09.932
We'll hang tomorrow?

44:16.237 --> 44:18.569
- Oh, yeah, that's what I like.
- Randy.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.648
Yeah, I like it. Oh, Randy.

44:27.748 --> 44:30.706
HoneyвЂќ? How was the date?

44:30.793 --> 44:32.124
Fine.

44:32.211 --> 44:35.374
Sweetheart, come in here
and tell us about it.

44:37.133 --> 44:38.623
Okay.

44:39.802 --> 44:40.632
So

44:40.720 --> 44:42.005
Hey. Hi

44:42.096 --> 44:44.382
- what did you guys see?
- Return of the jedi

44:44.473 --> 44:45.508
ooh.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.215
Is Darth Vader Luke's father?

44:48.227 --> 44:49.433
Tell me. Tell me.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.637
No, don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Okay, tell me.

44:52.732 --> 44:54.688
- Yeah, he's...
- Don't tell me. Okay, tell me.

44:54.775 --> 44:56.561
Yeah, he's the dad.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.563
Wait. Who's whose dad?

44:59.572 --> 45:01.403
Well, the jedi.

45:03.618 --> 45:04.949
Are you lying to us?

45:06.078 --> 45:09.161
- I can tell you're lying. Your mouth is open.
- Close your mouth.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.239
We try to be so chill,
and you're lying to us?

45:11.334 --> 45:14.667
Our plans changed, and
I didn't have a dime,

45:14.754 --> 45:18.087
and it's not like I have some kind
of satellite phone device

45:18.174 --> 45:20.916
I can keep in my pocket
and just transmit to outer space

45:21.010 --> 45:22.966
and call you guys whenever I want to.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.336
You're grounded, young lady.

45:25.431 --> 45:27.763
Thank you for turning me
into a typical mother.

45:27.850 --> 45:31.388
I'd like you to go wash
your face and go to bed.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.720
- Wash it.
- Is that how you ground a child?

45:33.814 --> 45:36.271
- I don't know.
- You did it the best you could have done it.

45:50.331 --> 45:54.119
- What are you doing here?
- Figured we could be grounded together.

45:55.336 --> 45:56.701
Shh.

45:56.796 --> 45:58.536
Sorry.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.540
Nice top hat.

46:02.635 --> 46:06.878
I may have gone through
a brief magician stage in fifth grade.

46:13.187 --> 46:15.428
Yeah, that's the day
that Karen got her car.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.146
Nice

46:25.783 --> 46:28.991
Yeah, that's just, like, a
thing that Stacey and I do.

46:29.078 --> 46:31.694
I've been making clothes
since I was, like, 7.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.575
So, what's this guy's story?

46:34.917 --> 46:35.952
Well, this is Shaun.

46:36.043 --> 46:37.908
- Shaun?
- I named him after Shaun Cassidy,

46:38.004 --> 46:39.790
who was, like, my first true love.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.711
Here, I'll show you.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.755
- See, I was kind of obsessed.
- Oh, wow. Hot.

46:43.843 --> 46:44.843
Shut up!

46:56.063 --> 46:57.678
Wow.

47:00.401 --> 47:03.939
It's like. It's like art.

47:04.030 --> 47:05.816
The way you put clothes together.

47:06.824 --> 47:09.691
I just think it's, like, why be boring?

47:09.785 --> 47:11.275
You know?

47:12.538 --> 47:13.538
Yeah

47:17.793 --> 47:20.626
my guidance counselor told
me there's this college,

47:20.713 --> 47:23.295
fashion institute of technology.

47:23.382 --> 47:25.794
- Yeah, where is it?
- New York City.

47:25.885 --> 47:26.795
Ooh.

47:26.886 --> 47:27.886
Yeah

47:28.804 --> 47:31.921
- but, I mean, I don't know.
- Let's do it. Let's go.

47:32.016 --> 47:34.132
I mean, some day.

47:34.226 --> 47:37.309
But, like, I have to
finish senior year and...

47:37.396 --> 47:41.639
Oh, my god, did I tell you
that, like, kroq is throwing our prom?

47:41.734 --> 47:43.019
No, no, no.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.601
I know what you're thinking,
but it's gonna be awesome.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.856
Is it?

47:46.947 --> 47:48.938
No. It is. I promise.

47:49.033 --> 47:51.570
Especially if I have the right date.

47:52.578 --> 47:56.196
What, you mean,
like, Shaun Cassidy over here?

48:00.503 --> 48:03.290
I hear he's got a lock on prom king.

50:57.012 --> 50:58.502
No.

50:58.597 --> 51:00.633
But you know what would be rad?

51:00.724 --> 51:04.308
If you, like, hung out in the
valley a little bit more?

51:06.146 --> 51:07.511
Do you really want me to?

51:07.606 --> 51:09.892
No, come on, my friends,
they're not, like, contagious.

51:12.444 --> 51:14.776
- I did some research.
- Research?

51:14.863 --> 51:16.103
About New York.

51:17.658 --> 51:20.616
The scene there is exploding.

51:20.703 --> 51:22.409
The east village.

51:22.496 --> 51:24.987
We could rent a railroad flat on Avenue a

51:26.000 --> 51:29.709
we'd be so broke,
we'd have to eat chef boyardee 24/7.

51:29.795 --> 51:32.411
And you'd be in fashion school.
Uh-huh.

51:32.506 --> 51:35.623
I'd write you songs
and play them for you on stage at cbgb.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.885
I don't know. I mean, I...

51:45.477 --> 51:48.093
No, I'm supposed
to, like, go to northridge in the fall,

51:48.188 --> 51:52.727
and, you know, my parents would, like...

51:54.945 --> 51:57.106
I mean, what do yours think?

52:04.371 --> 52:05.952
Look, I don't have that.

52:08.334 --> 52:10.450
It's just me and you.

52:12.463 --> 52:14.328
That's all I want.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.498
J I'll stop the world &

52:19.261 --> 52:21.343
j and melt with you &

52:22.348 --> 52:25.306
j you've seen the changes j

52:26.518 --> 52:29.760
j it's getting better all the time j

52:30.814 --> 52:34.602
j there's nothing you and I won't do j

52:35.611 --> 52:39.103
j I'll stop the world and melt with you j

53:05.724 --> 53:07.055
Hey, you okay?

53:40.759 --> 53:43.125
Did I tell you guys that
Randy's writing me a song?

53:43.220 --> 53:46.132
Oh, he's in a band? I didn't know that.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.259
Let me guess, a punk band.

53:48.350 --> 53:50.306
Technically speaking, punk is dead.

53:54.773 --> 53:59.733
You know, honey, ahem, I
was thinking that, uh...

53:59.820 --> 54:01.606
I, uh...

54:01.697 --> 54:03.608
I'm not so sure that he's the guy for you.

54:03.699 --> 54:05.155
You know?

54:06.368 --> 54:08.233
Dad, you don't even know him.

54:08.328 --> 54:10.990
Well, I think that he's too old for you.

54:11.081 --> 54:13.823
And I think he drives too fast
and I think he does too many drugs.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.938
- Which is any amount of drugs, in my book.
- And, also, he's never once

54:16.962 --> 54:19.482
come to the door to pick you up,
knocked and introduced himself.

54:19.548 --> 54:22.039
- He doesn't introduce himself.
- Like Mickey used to do?

54:22.134 --> 54:23.278
- Yes.
- Sure, like Mickey.

54:23.302 --> 54:24.712
Yes. Like Mickey.

54:24.803 --> 54:27.966
By the way, Barry said that Mickey
is torn up without you. Torn up.

54:28.056 --> 54:30.576
That doesn't surprise me at all.
You talked to his dad?

54:30.642 --> 54:33.725
- Honey, it was an investment thing, okay?
- Oh, my god.

54:33.812 --> 54:36.303
By the way, we're not
investing in macintosh.

54:36.398 --> 54:38.501
- We're gonna go with commodore.
- You're the boss.

54:38.525 --> 54:41.983
Point is, honey, Mickey, he's got a future.

54:42.070 --> 54:43.731
Mickey is the kind of person

54:43.822 --> 54:46.188
- who'll take care of you...
- He's reliable, going places.

54:46.283 --> 54:48.069
- Of your kids.
- He can take care of you.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.025
What are you guys even talking about?

54:50.120 --> 54:52.486
I mean, honey, next year,
you're gonna be at northridge,

54:52.581 --> 54:55.288
and you're gonna have to make
a lot of big decisions.

54:55.375 --> 54:58.583
- Your mom and I wanna help prepare you.
- I might not even go to northridge.

55:03.884 --> 55:07.092
There's some really rad fashion stuff
happening in New York.

55:08.722 --> 55:09.757
New York City?

55:09.848 --> 55:11.304
Yeah, and Randy said that...

55:11.391 --> 55:14.554
Honey, you're not moving across the country
with a guy we've never met.

55:14.645 --> 55:16.977
- Dad...
- Especially not to New York City, okay?

55:17.064 --> 55:20.397
- No.
- That's the crime capital of the world.

55:20.484 --> 55:24.648
- Okay, the crime statistics. Murder capital.
- Basically, it's a giant jail.

55:24.738 --> 55:26.979
You walk down the street
and it's just stabbings.

55:27.074 --> 55:30.237
- Stabbing.
- Whoa, whoa, guys.

55:31.829 --> 55:35.947
Okay. What if I just invite him over?
For dinner?

55:36.041 --> 55:38.532
That way, you guys could get to know him.

55:38.627 --> 55:40.163
Could we start there?

55:52.683 --> 55:53.683
What?

55:54.518 --> 55:57.885
I mean, I know I haven't seen you in a
while, but pretty sure the guy I remember

55:57.980 --> 56:01.723
didn't dress like Kenny loggins and go
hang out with a bunch of old yuppies.

56:01.817 --> 56:03.102
(Give me a break.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.935
Like you haven't done
some warped stuff for chicks.

56:06.029 --> 56:07.735
Remember mad dog Marie?

56:07.823 --> 56:09.779
Oh, yes, who went off to Marie-hab.

56:11.076 --> 56:13.738
Yeah, I mean, this is sort of
the first phase of our plan.

56:13.829 --> 56:17.492
She wants her folks to know the guy
who's taking their girl away.

56:17.583 --> 56:18.914
She's not moving in here.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.458
- That's not happening.
- No, no, no. NYC, man.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.464
What do you mean, "NYC, man"?

56:28.468 --> 56:30.254
Going to New York now?

56:30.345 --> 56:32.677
So that's just it, then?

56:32.764 --> 56:35.426
No more band. I mean... okay.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.553
Cool. Well, thanks for letting me know.

56:37.644 --> 56:39.635
You and sticky should come.

56:39.730 --> 56:43.143
Look, I've got some new songs.
And a new scene gives us freedom.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.233
Why are you doing this?

56:44.318 --> 56:48.778
We have people here who like our music,
and they actually, like, come to our shows.

56:48.864 --> 56:51.776
- Everything we've been working for.
- Wanna spend the rest of your life

56:51.867 --> 56:55.030
playing the same five songs
to the same 50 people in the same club?

56:55.120 --> 56:57.076
This girl is Nancy.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.371
You're sid and she's Nancy.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.370
And not in a good way.
What, you think that's gonna work?

57:02.461 --> 57:04.998
Those rich assholes, they're
gonna hate you, man.

57:05.088 --> 57:06.373
They already hate you.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.501
She digs me, her parents
are gonna dig me too.

57:08.592 --> 57:10.878
News flash. Parents don't
dig you, all right?

57:10.969 --> 57:12.925
Not even your own.

57:16.975 --> 57:18.966
Damn it, I'm late!

57:21.480 --> 57:24.392
Don't grill him about his parents.
He doesn't like to talk about them.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.394
- Honey.
- Or his grades. He's totally smart.

57:26.485 --> 57:28.646
Sweetheart, I am gonna keep an open mind.

57:43.752 --> 57:45.743
There's so many cul-de-sacs
in the neighborhood.

57:45.837 --> 57:49.125
It's easy to drive around in circles.

58:00.769 --> 58:03.010
Hello? Julie?

58:05.357 --> 58:06.893
Julie.

58:08.276 --> 58:11.393
I'm wondering if we need
to buy Randy a Timex.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.069
Ha, ha.

58:30.173 --> 58:31.333
I'm gonna start.

58:31.425 --> 58:32.756
Dad, no. I am.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.801
Steve.
вЂњIt's rude. Your mother made a lot of food.

58:35.887 --> 58:37.718
I don't like someone treating me like this.

58:37.806 --> 58:41.048
- We've been waiting for a long time.
- I bet you are thrilled he's not here.

58:41.143 --> 58:42.758
Don't say that.
вЂњWe're not thrilled.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.434
But we are validated.

58:44.521 --> 58:48.685
The truth is, it is better to just
find out now what kind of a person he is.

58:48.775 --> 58:50.857
You can find someone who
can take care of you.

58:50.944 --> 58:55.654
Not everybody is as needy
and scared of the world as you are.

59:04.041 --> 59:06.248
Jesus, guys can suck.

59:06.334 --> 59:09.076
- Yeah.
- You must've been so pissed.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.374
Embarrassed.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.499
Mostly just sad.

59:15.594 --> 59:18.301
So, I mean, was that it?

59:18.388 --> 59:19.844
It was just over?

59:19.931 --> 59:21.216
Well, I didn't know.

59:21.308 --> 59:24.471
I called and there was no answer.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.017
I thought maybe it was.

59:27.647 --> 59:28.762
But then.

59:34.404 --> 59:35.564
I'm sorry.

59:35.655 --> 59:38.021
Well, then why didn't you show up?

59:39.034 --> 59:40.649
Parents are hard for me, okay?

59:40.744 --> 59:42.405
That's your big excuse?

59:43.497 --> 59:46.489
You know what, trigonometry is hard for me,
but I still show up.

59:47.793 --> 59:49.784
What do you want me to say, JulieвЂќ?

59:50.837 --> 59:52.953
You want my whole pathetic life story?

59:53.048 --> 59:55.004
How my dad bailed on me
before I was even born?

59:55.092 --> 01:00:00.257
How my mom kicked me out of the house
because she wanted to start a real family?

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:07.388
Look, you have this life.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:09.344
This shiny, bright, perfect...

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.769
I saw it I see...

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.815
I don't know how to fit into this.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.528
You could start by showing up.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.536
I will

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.994
cool.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:37.047
I need to work on my dance moves
if I'm ever gonna be on mtv.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.967
- You're so good at dancing.
- Who has time for that?

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:43.295
Like, I totally was watching
the "thriller" video today...

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.143
Happy birthday.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.019
Is it 7

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:52.186
oh, my god.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.933
Oh, I love it.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:59.314
Oh, thank you.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.523
I'm kind of having a birthday
party this Saturday.

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.949
Oh I didn't know.

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:06.901
I mean, it was, like, totally last-minute.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:12.208
But you're totally invited,
as long as you're okay with, you know...

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:16.294
Oh, my god, stop.
You're totally putting me in the middle

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.292
- just like my mom does.
- Spaz down, Stacey.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.293
(God.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.966
Mickey will be there with me.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.009
Yeah. I heard about you two.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.962
Yeah? What'd you hear?
Was it something like:

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:29.299
"Ah! Mickey! Oh, my god, Mickey!"

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.430
We used to say that exes were off-limits.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.762
Yeah, well, we used to say a lot of stuff.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.472
What do you care now? You have Randy.

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:40.648
God, this is so stupid.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:44.106
I think you guys would actually just
really like him if you got to know him.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:47.034
Well, why don't you bring
him to my birthday party?

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.080
Okay.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.584
Whoo! Keep on wheeling!

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:01.960
- Hey, that's for you.
- Oh, my god, thank you so much.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.132
It's a book.

I have tiny cars on my feet.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.724
This is really good practice.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.318
- For what?
- Prom.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.606
Oh, my god, you guys came!

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.486
Oh. Happy birthday.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.738
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, totally.

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.194
Hey, Randy.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.371
Right on. Happy birthday.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.541
Oh, it's a scratch-off lottery ticket.

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:38.664
That's already been scratched off.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.792
You take that to any gas station,
they'll give you 3 bucks. Cash.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:44.249
Oh. Thank you.

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:53.934
I'm here with the birthday girl,
and it is time for "the safety dance."

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.726

- Yeah, for sure, Karen.

What are you doing here, freak?

Where's the beef, huh?

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:52.607
I'm cool.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.446
Just making sure you're okay, buddy.

I mean, your girl was kind of all over me.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.200
You look angry. You need
to cool off a little bit?

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:12.211
Yeah, she's really something, isn't she?

Yeah, he's crazy, man.

Get off of me! Get off of me! You think I wanna
be here with these trust-fund jerk-offs?

- Wow. Classy.
- What happened, dude?

You okay?

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:10.849
- Stacey, I am so sorry.
- I think that you should probably just go.

01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:15.353
- But, Stacey...
- Just go, please.

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:20.244
Thank god.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:22.034
I think he's actually psychotic.

What was that?

01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:36.086
What is wrong with you?

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:40.045
You realize that everything my friends ever
thought about you you just proved them right?

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:42.471
- Why do you care what they think?
- They're my friends.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:46.347
What, these vapid, stupid,
rich, shitty people?

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:48.519
I am one of those people, Randy.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:54.730
You know what, all we ever do
is hang out with your friends,

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.812
listen to your band, do your stuff,

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:01.024
but the moment I even try to show you
my world, you, like, totally sabotage it.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:04.781
I'm sorry, okay?

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:07.572
Wait, come here. Come on.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.750
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:18.212
All those amazing things we said we were
gonna do, let's just go and do that.

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:19.587
None of this stuff matters.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:23.216
You see, that's the problem,
it's that nothing matters to you.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:27.176
But I have things in my life that I
care about, that are important to me.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.263
Don't tell me you're gonna
bring up prom again.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.015
Seriously, Julie?

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.768
It's like we're from different planets.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.069
If you want a prom king,

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:40.522
maybe I'm not your guy.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:43.694
You know what, maybe you're not.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.285
- You don't mean that.
- Does this look like it's working to you?

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.124
I have given up everything for you.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:53.701
- You don't even show up.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:57.537
- Your fake friends aren't gonna call you back?
- I'm sorry that I have people in my life

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.091
that care about me, okay?

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:04.799
You're right.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:10.510
It's not working.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.564
You know what?

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.189
Forget it.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:20.858
For sure.

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:24.527
Like, totally.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.515
J I saw your eyes j

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:55.643
j saw your eyes j

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:58.266
j and you made me cry j

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:01.774
j made me cry j

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.197
> and for a little while j

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:08.902
I little while j

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:12.159
j I was falling in love j

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.099
J I was falling in love j

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:49.986
j I was falling in love j

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:57.034

01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:00.871
j falling in love I

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:07.051
j falling in love I

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.892
Those tots look awfully lonely.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.395
I know how they feel.

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:25.942
You think, uh, one of them might like
to be my date to prom?

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.486
What about Karen? No.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:31.192
No, I broke up with Karen.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.825
It's never been about her.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.036
Only us.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.457
So, what do you say?

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.384
Yeah. Okay.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.471
Let's do prom.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.171
- You okay?
- Yeah. Prom could be fun.

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:54.097
It will be fun.

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:56.801
But it doesn't mean we're
back together. Okay?

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.896
All right, sweet. Yes, ma'am.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.566
But seriously, are you
gonna finish those tots?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.537
J I would say I'm sorry &

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:29.217
j if I thought
that it would change your mind j

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:33.929
I but I know that this time j

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:38.851
j I have said too much
been too unkind j

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:42.263
j I try to laugh about it &

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:45.646

j I would break down at your feet &

I but I know that it's too late j

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:15.130
j now there's nothing I can do j

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.510

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.426

Sol

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.254
I saw that song that you wrote for her.

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:17.798
It's good.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:22.719
You'll get her back.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:26.098
No. I'm pretty sure she's done.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:29.730
Damn.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.189
Maybe we should go to New York anyway.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:37.279
You know? I mean, a change could be good.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.857
Check out a new scene?

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:43.239
Plus, we're getting evicted, so...

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.077
What do you think?

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.785
You know what, let's do it.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.041
Yeah?

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:56.962
Let's get the hell out of town.
Yeah!

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.480
Stace?

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.521
Will you hear me out?

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:13.691
Like, I don't really have a choice.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:17.316
Look, I am so, so sorry
about your birthday party, okay?

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.523
And I'm not with him anymore.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.529
And I know, it's not...

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.118
Are you okay?

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:30.329
And look, I've been, like,
the worst friend recently...

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.784
No, I said stuff too.

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:33.797
But it's just...

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.873
I mean, everything at home is so...

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:39.424
- I just want everything to stay the same.
- Yeah, totally.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.252
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.388
Um

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:46.632
I kind of got into dartmouth.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:49.681
Wait, what?

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.683
- You got into dartmouth?
- Mm-hm_

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:52.889
Stace, that's amazing.

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:56.726
I know. But you all are going to northridge,
and Karen will, like, freak out at me...

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.357
No, no, no. Screw Karen.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.607
You have to go.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.188
That's Ivy league.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.274
- Oh, my god!
- I'm going to an lvy league school.

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.451
You got in! You're a genius.
Yeah

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:08.746
you're going to dartmouth. Oh, my god!

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:12.075
- Oh, I really have to pee, though.
- Oh. Okay. Sorry.

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.909
Mom's letting me get a waterbed.

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.665
Whoo! Yup.

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:18.623
You know.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:23.888
Oh, my god.

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:30.180
Wow. Four years of silent treatment.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:32.136
Northridge is gonna be a blast.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.892
Karen? She lied.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:37.100
Didn't even get into northridge. Idiot.

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:39.731
- But I got in?
- Maybe that's why she went nuclear on us.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:42.689
Hey. Don't forget that pink dress, right?

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.774
The one that goes with my cummerbund.

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:47.030
I was thinking it might be
rad if I did something...

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:49.282
Don't you wanna match, babe?

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:55.163
Right. Julie.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.289
Yeah

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.496
not "babe."

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.047
I want a hot dog.

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.624
Let's go.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.922
You look bitchen.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.390
Thanks.

01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:13.594
Ah, I remember my prom.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:16.268
It's a lot of pressure, right?

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.027
Totally.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.776
Oh, my god.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:25.867
I know.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.616
Oh. Wait.

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:31.495
This is gonna make it, like, mega.

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:35.575
Oh, my god. Totally.

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:36.704
Ah

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.377
So, like, what happened with Karen?

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:42.081
Ugh. She called you a backstabber
for hanging out with him.

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:45.339
And I was like, "wait, you totally did
the same thing but, like, way worse."

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:48.262
She freaked out, stopped the car
right in the middle of ventura

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.384
and told me to get out.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:52.808
Yeah, and then she told me not to get out,
but I did anyway.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.396
Julie! Come quick,
I want you to see this.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.274
Put our fight on hold for a second.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:07.235
Look, look.

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:09.362
T-minus-10, nine...

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:10.909
You know what that is?

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:13.988
That's the first female astronaut.
That's Sally ride.

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.665
Go for main engine start
and we have ignition.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.459
There she goes. There she goes.
вЂњAnd now liftoff

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:23.004
for America's first woman astronaut.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:28.052
The launchpad is clear,
and sts-7 is free of the towers.

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:29.628
There she goes.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:31.766
Pretty cool.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.762
- Yeah.
- She js the first.

01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:36.468
A stunning accomplishment.

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:37.928
You know, I bet...

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.853
I bet her parents had some scary times.

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:43.605
You know, a daughter like that?

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.150
Always wanting to Blaze
her own trail, you know?

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:49.072
One thousand miles an hour.

01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:54.078
But, damn, I bet they're proud today.

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:01.994
You know, Sally ride...

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.372
She's from encino.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:06.715
She's a valley girl.

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:45.214
Not exactly.

01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:49.048
We moved to New York, and
they got a record deal

01:34:49.142 --> 01:34:51.508
right when I was finishing fashion school.

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:55.687
