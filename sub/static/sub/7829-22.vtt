(tires screech)

00:09.551 --> 00:10.719
D'oh!

00:10.802 --> 00:12.345
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:35.618 --> 00:38.496
Grampa! I don't mind
when you spit at home,

00:38.580 --> 00:39.748
but I have to work
with these people.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.458
Oh, jabberjack.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.959
Schoolhouse don't
put out spittoons.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.545
I ain't responsible.
(spits)

00:45.628 --> 00:49.466
All right, seniors. We'd all love
to share in your wisdom, experience--

00:49.549 --> 00:51.051
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.053
Let's start
with Milhouse's grandfather.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.597
Uh, how many of you
have a house?

00:55.680 --> 00:57.557
All right.
Now, how many of you

00:57.640 --> 00:59.392
drove your house
to school today?

00:59.476 --> 01:01.728
-(kids muttering)
-Huh?

01:01.811 --> 01:04.355
Well, I did.
(chuckles)

01:04.439 --> 01:06.274
No, I'm not Superman.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.276
I just own an R.V.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.403
Me and the new wife
travel the country

01:10.487 --> 01:12.572
searching for adventure.

01:12.655 --> 01:16.701
Last fall, we won a chili
cook-off in Beaumont, Texas.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.037
CHILDREN:
Wow.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.997
You're living in a
fool's paradise, Van Houten.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.084
If you fell down in the shower,
that thing would be your tomb.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.712
Grampa, hush.
Here, why don't you spit some more?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.214
(chuckles)

01:29.297 --> 01:30.924
No, I'm not Superman.

01:31.007 --> 01:31.966
I'm a judge.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.468
Why, just this morning,

01:33.551 --> 01:35.512
I sentenced my 46th man
to death.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.472
Oh-- No, 47th.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.808
(applause)

01:39.891 --> 01:43.645
Wow, 47.
I love you, Grampa.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.940
Yeah, well-- I may not have
a fancy black bathrobe

01:47.023 --> 01:48.983
and a hammer like Snooty,

01:49.067 --> 01:51.736
but I do have slippers
and an oatmeal spoon. Look.

01:51.820 --> 01:52.862
(kids snickering)

01:52.946 --> 01:55.448
Bart, perhaps
your grandfather

01:55.532 --> 01:56.991
would like to come up front now

01:57.075 --> 01:58.618
and give someone else a chance
to interrupt.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.411
Oh, please, no.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.372
-'Bout time, Knothead.
-Aah!

02:03.665 --> 02:05.583
Now...

02:05.667 --> 02:08.253
Hey, listen!

02:08.336 --> 02:11.506
Now, my story begins
in 19-dickety-two.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.341
We had to say "dickety"

02:13.424 --> 02:15.969
'cause the Kaiser had stolen
our word "twenty."

02:16.052 --> 02:18.513
I chased that rascal
to get it back

02:18.596 --> 02:21.516
but gave up after
dickety-six miles.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.518
(Martin chortles)
"Dickety"?

02:23.601 --> 02:24.602
Highly dubious.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.104
What you cackling at, fatty?

02:26.187 --> 02:28.898
Too much pie,
that's your problem.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.193
Now, I 'd like to digress
from my prepared remarks

02:32.277 --> 02:35.530
to discuss how I invented
the terlet.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.031
"Terlet." Ha!

02:37.115 --> 02:39.117
(all laughing)

02:39.200 --> 02:40.451
Stop your snickering.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.953
I spent three years
on that terlet.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.921
And then he claimed
he was the one

02:52.005 --> 02:54.632
who turned cats and dogs
against each other.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.302
Why is he always making up
those crazy stories?

02:57.385 --> 02:59.637
Maybe it's time we put Grampa
in a home.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.182
You already
put him in a home.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.683
Maybe it's time we put him in
one where he can't get out.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.602
No! Old people
deserve our respect.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.854
Look at Jacques Cousteau
and Goldie Hawn.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.148
You wouldn't shut them away
like second-class citizens.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.608
Second-class?

03:11.691 --> 03:14.027
What about Social Security,

03:14.110 --> 03:16.738
bus discounts,
MedicAlert jewelry,

03:16.821 --> 03:18.448
Gold Bond powder,

03:18.531 --> 03:20.366
pants all the way up
to your armpits,

03:20.450 --> 03:21.826
and all those other
senior perks?

03:21.910 --> 03:24.996
Oh, if you ask me,
old folks have it pretty sweet.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.668
(groans)
Let's see.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.003
Ehh...

03:34.464 --> 03:35.465
(sighs)

03:36.758 --> 03:39.093
(muttering)

03:39.177 --> 03:41.554
Eh, this junk was hardly worth
getting up for.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.890
Maybe if I go back to sleep
for a few days,

03:43.973 --> 03:45.600
some good mail will build up.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.310
Hey, what's this?

03:48.436 --> 03:49.437
"Asa Phelps has--"

03:49.520 --> 03:50.480
(gasps)

03:50.563 --> 03:52.523
The Seventh Hellfish is dead?

03:52.607 --> 03:56.486
That means the fortune's
almost mine.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.748
Asa Phelps spent his entire life
in Springfield

04:08.831 --> 04:11.084
except for
four years' service

04:11.167 --> 04:14.254
in World War II,
and one high school day-trip.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.590
He worked at the United Strut
and Bracing Works

04:17.674 --> 04:20.760
as a molder's boy
until he was replaced

04:20.843 --> 04:23.721
by a molder-matic and died.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.738
Would you do the honors?

04:46.786 --> 04:48.955
Well, Simpson,
seven gone.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.666
As soon as you're in
your pressboard coffin,

04:51.749 --> 04:54.711
I'll be the sole survivor,
and the treasure will be mine.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.629
Over my dead body
it will.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.923
That's exactly the point--

04:59.007 --> 05:01.634
Oh, Simpson,
can't you go five seconds

05:01.718 --> 05:03.219
without humiliating yourself?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.470
(boinging)

05:06.472 --> 05:09.183
How long was that?

05:09.267 --> 05:11.519
Your clownish behavior
notwithstanding,

05:11.602 --> 05:13.396
we have made
a gentlemen's agreement

05:13.479 --> 05:16.482
and sworn on our lives
to honor it.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.235
Smithers, I want
that man killed.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.323
(boinging)

05:26.784 --> 05:29.579
Let's see, "mesmerists,
dowsers, luddites,

05:29.662 --> 05:32.206
alienists, Zoroastrians,
alphabetizers--"

05:32.290 --> 05:34.208
Aha! "Assassins."

05:34.292 --> 05:37.587
I was wondering, sir,
do we really need to, uh,

05:37.670 --> 05:39.672
"settle" Abe Simpson?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.466
I mean, I 'm familiar with
his physical state and--

05:41.549 --> 05:44.427
Perhaps if we wait, nature
will assassinate him for us.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.095
Well, I can't risk it.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.472
I won't allow that Simpson boy

05:47.555 --> 05:49.098
to take the Hellfish bonanza,

05:49.182 --> 05:51.059
and I can't get it
without his key.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.394
Ah, just the man I need.

05:53.478 --> 05:57.690
Fernando Vidal, the world's
most devious assassin.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.235
(phone ringing)

06:01.319 --> 06:02.278
<i>Hola.</i>

06:02.362 --> 06:04.489
BURNS: <i>Fernando, it's M.B.</i>

06:04.572 --> 06:06.324
Ah, Marion Barry.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.868
Is it time
for another shipment already?

06:08.951 --> 06:10.912
<i>This is Montgomery Burns.</i>

06:10.995 --> 06:12.330
Oh, <i>caramba.</i>

06:12.413 --> 06:14.707
I'm sending you a photo
over the faxtrola.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.751
I need you to fly to Springfield

06:16.834 --> 06:18.920
and assassinate this man,
post-haste.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.427
Ah, Del Monte.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.764
Enjoy them, old man.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.016
They will be your last.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.272
(snoring)

06:43.194 --> 06:45.905
(alarm ringing)
I'm up! I'm up!

06:49.283 --> 06:52.954
Ah, he's more clever
than he looks.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.875
-(buzzing)
-WOMAN (on speaker): <i>Abraham Simpson,</i>

06:57.959 --> 06:59.836
<i>your family is here</i>
<i>to visit you.</i>

06:59.919 --> 07:02.213
Hot diggity, my family's
come to visit me!

07:03.548 --> 07:05.258
Wait a minute.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.343
My family never comes to vi--

07:07.427 --> 07:08.719
(yells)

07:10.680 --> 07:13.099
D'oh, not again!

07:13.182 --> 07:16.477
I can't take much more
of your blundering numskullery.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.229
I'll be in the car, dudes.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.027
There is one more way
to kill a man,

07:25.111 --> 07:27.989
but it is
as intricate and precise

07:28.072 --> 07:31.325
as a well-played game of chess.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.082
Was that me,
or was that you?

07:44.255 --> 07:48.092
Nurse! Nurse!
Someone's trying to kill me!

07:48.176 --> 07:50.470
Okay, we'll do something
about that right away.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.680
Let's start
by doubling your medication.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.186
The residents...

07:58.269 --> 08:00.188
are trying...

08:00.271 --> 08:01.606
to nap!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.358
(pounding on door)

08:04.442 --> 08:05.651
Let me in!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.361
Someone's trying
to kill me!

08:07.445 --> 08:11.157
Sweet merciful McGillicuddy,
you got to open the door!

08:11.240 --> 08:12.492
Who is it?

08:12.575 --> 08:14.577
It's Grampa.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.747
And it sounds like he's gotten
into the horseradish again.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.000
And then a knife flew
at my head,

08:21.083 --> 08:22.793
and you were there--

08:22.877 --> 08:25.421
And you were there.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.090
Uh, Grampa, maybe I should
moisten your washcloth.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.884
It's plenty moist!

08:29.967 --> 08:32.136
Listen, Monty Burns
is trying to kill me,

08:32.220 --> 08:33.638
and it's all because--

08:33.721 --> 08:35.640
Of, um-- I can't tell you why.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.059
Well, I 'm sure
you'll make up something.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.019
Maybe you just need
more of my classmates around.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.854
I got to hole up here
for a while.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.233
They might still be after me.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.652
Wow, he's even more
agitated than usual.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.237
Maybe we should
let him stay.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.613
Where are we going
to put him?

08:50.696 --> 08:51.781
-Bart's room.
-Bart's room.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.241
-Bart's room.
-Dumpster.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.623
Sorry to crowd you, boy,

09:00.706 --> 09:02.500
but I'll let you in
on a secret.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.168
Burns is after me

09:04.252 --> 09:06.921
'cause he wants
the Hellfish bonanza.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.506
Look, if you're going
to stay in my room,

09:08.589 --> 09:11.217
could you at least
stop making up gibberish?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.136
Gibberish, eh?
Then what's this?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.304
Wrinkly gibberish?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.598
Why, you smart--

09:17.682 --> 09:22.603
I got this in the
second World War II.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.523
Back then, I was known
as sergeant Simpson,

09:25.606 --> 09:28.401
and I commanded
the Flying Hellfish--

09:28.484 --> 09:32.029
the fightingest squad
in the fightingest company

09:32.113 --> 09:35.825
in the third-fightingest
battalion in the army

09:35.908 --> 09:37.868
and we were all
from Springfield.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.080
There was police chief Wiggum's
father, Iggy Wiggum.

09:41.163 --> 09:44.584
Um, if anybody finds a grenade
without a pin, that's mine.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.505
Our radioman,
Sheldon Skinner.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.924
All right, very funny.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.802
Well, I didn't join the service
to make friends.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.596
And watching our backs

09:56.679 --> 09:59.682
was private fifth class
Arnie Gumble.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.392
(loud belch)

10:01.475 --> 10:03.728
Then there was also
Griff, Asa, Ox and Etch.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.480
But every unit has
a troublemaker.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.735
Ours was a cocky little private
named Montgomery Burns.

10:10.818 --> 10:11.944
(yawns)

10:12.028 --> 10:14.405
Haven't you won the war yet?

10:14.488 --> 10:16.866
Duh, hey, you said you was dead.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.577
Yes, dead tired.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.163
But I 'm quite refreshed now.
Thank you.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.956
Mm-hmm.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.917
You bossed around the richest,
most powerful guy in town.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.670
How come you were a sergeant
and he was only a private?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.922
Well, he got busted down

10:32.006 --> 10:34.091
for obstructing a probe
from J. Edgar Hoover.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.509
We got stuck with him.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.221
(Grampa chuckles)

10:39.305 --> 10:42.933
Now they'll never
save your brain, Hitler.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.521
A little help?

10:47.605 --> 10:50.483
(shells whistling
and exploding)

10:50.566 --> 10:53.486
(whimpering)

10:53.569 --> 10:56.447
Boom! Boom, it went.
Boom! Just like that.

10:56.530 --> 11:00.201
They took a photo of my keister
for <i>Stars and Stripes.</i>

11:00.284 --> 11:03.329
At least they told me
it was for <i>Stars and Stripes.</i>

11:03.412 --> 11:04.872
Well, if you saved Burns' life,

11:04.955 --> 11:06.624
why does he want to kill you?

11:06.707 --> 11:08.459
It was the closing days
of the war.

11:08.542 --> 11:12.088
We had just flushed some Germans
out of an abandoned castle--

11:17.593 --> 11:21.847
-Hey, Burnsie found some pictures.
-Wait a minute.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.849
We ain't a-sposed
to steal from civilians.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.143
You want me to report you
to Commander Flanders?

11:26.227 --> 11:27.436
Just leave them, Burnsie.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.146
Leave them for whom,
the Germans?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.815
The folks
who shoot at us all day?

11:30.898 --> 11:32.233
Let's just take them.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.777
We'll all be rich,
rich as Nazis.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.820
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.196
He's got a point there.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.739
Think of what a guy
could get himself

11:38.823 --> 11:40.616
with that kind of scratch.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.743
I could buy chicken dinners
three times a day.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.080
I could buy a brand new Studebaker
with a fan on the dashboard.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.832
I could buy my way into high--

11:47.915 --> 11:48.833
(belches)

11:48.916 --> 11:50.376
...society.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.044
Well, I don't feel
right about it,

11:52.128 --> 11:54.088
but I could use a nest egg
for retirement.

11:54.171 --> 11:57.174
I'd hate to wind up
in one of them old folks' homes.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.218
Then it's agreed.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.970
Of course, we can't sell
the paintings now.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.596
We'd be caught.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.974
How many of you are familiar
with the concept

12:05.057 --> 12:06.308
of a "tontine"?

12:08.811 --> 12:11.230
All right, Ox. Why don't you
take us through it?

12:11.313 --> 12:14.400
Duh, essentially,
we all enter into a contract

12:14.483 --> 12:16.986
whereby the last
surviving participant

12:17.069 --> 12:20.489
becomes the sole possessor
of all them purty pictures.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.991
Well put, Oxford.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.369
Now, remember, you can't
all sign with an "X."

12:27.204 --> 12:30.249
GRAMPA:
<i>So we sealed up the paintings</i>

12:30.332 --> 12:33.586
<i>knowing only one of us would</i>
<i>ever look upon them again.</i>

12:37.047 --> 12:38.799
Ox was the first to go.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.802
He got a hernia carrying
the crate out of the castle.

12:41.886 --> 12:46.015
Five more men died in the Veterans' Day
float disaster of '79.

12:46.098 --> 12:49.810
Now, with Asa gone,
it's down to me and Burns.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.395
Great story, Grampa.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.897
Could have used
a vampire, though.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.607
'Night.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.651
Oh-- My own grandson
thinks I'm a liar.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.821
(loud buzzing)

13:00.905 --> 13:01.822
(yells)

13:01.906 --> 13:04.575
Don't kill me!

13:04.658 --> 13:06.952
I've tried to meet you
halfway on this, Simpson,

13:07.036 --> 13:09.830
but you had to be
little Johnny Live-A-Lot.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.875
Now, give me your key
to the Hellfish bonanza.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.002
Oh, wow.
There really is a treasure.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.505
Whatever you do,
don't give him the key, Grampa.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.756
Here's the key.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.133
Aw-- Figures.
Hey, Mr. Burns!

13:21.217 --> 13:22.635
Can I go with you
to get the treasure?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.136
I won't eat much,
and I don't know

13:24.220 --> 13:25.888
the difference between
right and wrong.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.933
Oh, you're a good boy,
but the child labor people

13:29.016 --> 13:30.726
have been watching me
like a hawk.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.269
Well, I 'm off
to get the paintings.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.230
As they say, time is "Monets."

13:34.313 --> 13:36.690
As you were, Sergeant.
(chuckles)

13:38.734 --> 13:41.362
Oh, terribly sorry.
Back to sleep, little girl.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.197
LISA:
Santa?

13:48.369 --> 13:51.664
Well, I guess Burns
is finally going to be rich.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.624
Not without
the keys, he isn't.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.418
Hey! You got the keys.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.254
Now we can get the treasure.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.005
Oh, what's the use?

14:00.089 --> 14:03.300
Burns would still find
some way to take it from me.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.845
I can't believe you,
Grampa.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.763
The sergeant
in that story you told

14:07.847 --> 14:09.139
would never be scared
of a dork like Burns.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.100
You got to get
that treasure.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.061
You got to do it for Ox and Asa
and Griff and Burnsie.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.063
Well, not so much Burnsie.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.358
You really think
I can do it?

14:19.441 --> 14:21.110
Uh-- Yes.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.279
But we got to act fast.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.614
Where are you two
going at this hour?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.783
-On a treasure hunt.
-Oh, can I come?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.661
Only if you're ready
to stare danger in the face,

14:30.744 --> 14:32.663
put your manhood
to the ultimate test,

14:32.746 --> 14:34.498
-and take--
-Pass.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.046
Hey, Grampa, do you think
your dead buddies

14:41.130 --> 14:43.340
get up and walk
around at night?

14:43.424 --> 14:44.717
If they're anything like me,
they have to get up twice.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.802
Okay, hold up here.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.347
Fellas, it's me, Sarge.
At ease.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.474
I know I'm bending
the rules tonight,

14:52.558 --> 14:54.351
but I also know
none of you wants

14:54.435 --> 14:56.645
that skunk Burns
to take our treasure.

14:56.729 --> 15:00.232
And I want you to know
that when I die,

15:00.316 --> 15:03.235
you're all welcome
to visit me

15:03.319 --> 15:06.155
in rich man's heaven.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.957
(rumbling)

15:25.633 --> 15:28.636
Now it's going to show us
exactly where to dig.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.104
TOGETHER:
D'oh!

15:39.188 --> 15:42.107
Boy, you borrow us
some diving equipment

15:42.191 --> 15:45.653
while I borrow this boat.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.613
Well, howdy-doodily,
stranger.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.239
Couldn't help but notice
you stealing my boat.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.741
I'll bring it back.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.035
-You ever operated
a power boat?
-No.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.329
-Know anything
about water safety?
-No.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.872
-What do you need it for?
-It's a secret.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.376
Sounds spine-tingly-dingling.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.544
Just promise you'll
have a good time.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.380
Maude, boys, come on up.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.174
We're going to have
a camp-out in the dinghy.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.175
KIDS:
Yay!

16:12.888 --> 16:15.432
Now, remember the plan, boy.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.102
If you run out of air,
tug on the rope--

16:18.185 --> 16:20.187
64 times. No more,
no less. Got it.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.690
No, 63 times
if you're out of air.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.109
64 is if you've
found the treasure.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.527
Gotcha.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.070
Hey, Grampa,
do you think

16:28.153 --> 16:30.239
I could have been
a Flying Hellfish?

16:30.322 --> 16:33.200
You're a gutsy daredevil
with a give-'em-hell attitude

16:33.283 --> 16:35.244
and a fourth-grade
education.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.162
You could have made sergeant.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.432
(gurgling)
Wow!

17:08.277 --> 17:10.279
Sixty-one,

17:10.362 --> 17:12.156
sixty-two,

17:12.239 --> 17:14.533
sixty-three!

17:14.616 --> 17:17.745
Oh, no, 63!

17:17.828 --> 17:19.288
He's out of air!

17:19.371 --> 17:21.957
I've sent my only grandson
to a watery--

17:22.041 --> 17:23.792
Sixty-four!

17:23.876 --> 17:25.377
He found the treasure!

17:25.461 --> 17:26.712
I'm rich!

17:32.843 --> 17:35.137
You're one heck
of a grandson, boy.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.140
Now let's break her open
and have a look-see.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.987
Huh. The light must
have burned out.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.408
I'll thank you to stop
pinching my Botticelli.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.993
(gasps)

17:58.077 --> 18:00.120
Looks like I didn't need
the keys after all.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.247
I'll take the masterpieces,
thank you.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.373
Consarn it.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.922
You coward.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.257
You're an embarrassment
to the name Hellfish.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.842
Oh, am I?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.928
No. Look, take
the art if you want.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.971
Just don't hurt the boy.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.224
Hmm-- I'd rather do both.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.773
(gasping)

18:30.025 --> 18:32.945
So long, Sarge. See you
at the reunion in November.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.457
(gasping)

18:51.088 --> 18:52.339
(gurgling)

19:11.441 --> 19:14.361
I'm sorry I cost you
your fortune, Grampa.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.156
The fortune
doesn't matter, boy.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.200
The important thing
is you're safe.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.618
Now let's get that fortune!

19:24.705 --> 19:25.998
They're gaining on us, sir.

19:26.081 --> 19:26.999
We'll have to jettison
something.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.670
It's been an honor
to serve you, sir.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.299
Consarn it,
he's getting away.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.050
In a pig's eye he is.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.688
Act your age, Simpson.
You look foolish.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.206
Don't kill me.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.874
I ain't gonna kill you.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.002
That would be cowardly,
Monty Burns cowardly.

20:12.085 --> 20:15.464
I just want to watch
you squirm.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.840
Yes, sir.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.842
Is this to your liking?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.552
(grunting)

20:23.180 --> 20:25.057
Now, Burnsie,
there's one thing

20:25.140 --> 20:26.934
we don't stand for
in the Hellfish

20:27.017 --> 20:29.436
and that's trying to kill
your commanding officer.

20:29.519 --> 20:33.023
So consider this
your dishonorable discharge.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.901
You're out of my unit,
you're out of the tontine,

20:35.984 --> 20:38.111
and that means
the paintings are mine.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.406
Private, you are dismissed.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.495
You're rich, Grampa.
You did it.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.623
And Burns can never
take that away from you.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.583
(sirens wailing)

20:51.667 --> 20:54.419
Freeze. U.S. State Department.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.963
We'll take those.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.381
We've been helping
the German government

20:57.464 --> 20:59.466
search for this stolen art
for 50 years.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.468
To avoid
an international incident,

21:01.551 --> 21:03.095
we'll be returning it
to the descendants

21:03.178 --> 21:05.681
of its rightful owner.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.183
Baron von Wortzenburger,

21:08.267 --> 21:10.227
on behalf of the American
people, I apologize--

21:10.310 --> 21:13.897
<i>Ja, ja, ja--</i>
<i>mach schnell mit</i>
<i>der art things, da?</i>

21:13.981 --> 21:16.316
I must get back
to <i>dancecentrum</i> in Stuttgart

21:16.400 --> 21:18.527
in time to see Kraftwerk.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.529
Hey, und, <i>dummkopf,</i>

21:20.612 --> 21:23.115
watch out for the C.D. changer
in my trunk, huh?

21:23.198 --> 21:25.409
Idiot.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.412
(techno-pop playing)

21:28.495 --> 21:31.415
I guess he deserves it
more than I do.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.835
Well, at least
I got to show you

21:34.918 --> 21:38.213
I wasn't always
a pathetic old kook.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.632
You never were, Grampa.

21:40.716 --> 21:46.013
Oh, I'd hug you, but I know
you'd just get embarrassed.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.556
I won't get embarrassed.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.224
I don't care who knows
I love my Grampa.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.478
