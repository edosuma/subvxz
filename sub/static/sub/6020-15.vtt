00:01.800 --> 00:05.679
Hey, if I were a gigolo, how much
do you think I could charge a night?

00:06.120 --> 00:08.634
- Here or in Japan?
- What's the difference?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.075
Well, the Japanese
are more enlightened.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.471
They can see beyond the physical.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.951
Forget Japan.
How much would you pay?

00:17.120 --> 00:20.874
Oh, I don't know. A dollar.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.349
I think I'm worth at least 300.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.232
I don't think so.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.676
- Hey, that's for all night.
- I know.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.592
- You're demeaning me.
- You're a gigolo.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.591
Well, you hired me.
I'm the victim here.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.273
Did I force you into this life?

00:35.440 --> 00:38.989
Yes. You and every woman like you.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.751
- Look how dark it's getting already.
- It's not daylight-savings time yet.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.876
When does it start?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.871
Don't know.
They tell you the night before.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.111
Well, I'm sick of waiting.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.555
I am springing ahead right now.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.439
Oh, I'm sure
that won't cause any problems.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.795
Oh, God, it's Mike Moffet.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.758
Don't tell me you're still mad
at him for calling you a phoney.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.352
Jerry, that was five years ago.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.988
I'm not a phoney. I don't want
anything to do with this guy.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.151
Mike! Mike.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.752
Kramer, Jerry, how's it going?

01:13.920 --> 01:15.592
Fine. And I'm not just saying that.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.119
Guess what. I just started
my own business. I'm a bookie.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.271
No openings in arson?

01:21.920 --> 01:24.832
Either of you guys wanna place a bet,
I'm your guy.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.878
No, no, no. No bets for me.
I got a disease.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.758
I'm feeling a bit queasy myself. Maybe
I'll see you in another five years.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.477
Jerry's still mad
about that phoney thing?

01:36.640 --> 01:39.757
Are you kidding?
It's all water near a bridge.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.753
- Oh, what time do you got?
- Oh, yes.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.879
- It's almost 6.
- Whoa, I'm really late.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.352
These designs look great.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.557
- Peggy, you really saved me.
- It was no problem.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.712
- Mr. Peterman is gonna love them.
- Thanks, Susie.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.433
You won't believe this,
but as I'm leaving, she calls me Susie.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.797
I don't see you as a Susie.
Sharon, maybe.

02:20.960 --> 02:25.909
What am I, a bulimic, chain-smoking
stenographer from Staten Island?

02:26.320 --> 02:28.470
- Who are you describing?
- Someone I know.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.756
- Named Sharon?
- I'd rather not say.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.112
Hey.

02:33.280 --> 02:37.034
- What's in the bag?
- New tuxedo for the Pinstripe Ball.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.033
Steinbrenner is throwing
a huge party at Tavern on the Green.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.519
Kind of a Yankee prom?

02:42.200 --> 02:44.714
It's not a prom. It's a ball.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.235
- You taking Allison?
- Yes, of course I'm taking Allison.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.675
This woman is genetically
engineered to go to a ball.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.035
- Tall, blond, lithe.
- Live?

02:52.200 --> 02:53.349
- Lithe.
- Live?

02:53.520 --> 02:55.511
- Lithe.
- Oh, lithe.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.912
- Well, you two will have a great time.
- It can't be worse than this.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.597
Wait till you see the dress
that she's got. It's backless.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.354
I'm finally gonna make
a great entrance.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.830
Backless? You gonna back her in?

03:09.840 --> 03:13.879
Elaine, when a woman makes
a ball entrance, she twirls.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.474
- She's not gonna twi...
- She'll twirl.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.231
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.437
He wants everyone to twirl around.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.794
- All right.
- Great.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.269
Hey, did you get your boss's
Knick ticket for Kramer?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.793
- Yeah, here.
- Great.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.549
- Say, George...
- Oh, courtside.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.392
Is that the best you could do?

03:34.560 --> 03:37.950
- George, we need to talk.
- What?

03:38.120 --> 03:40.315
I really think we need to talk.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.232
- She wants to talk?
- She doesn't want to.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.868
- She needs to talk.
- Nobody needs to talk.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.393
Who would want to?

03:50.560 --> 03:53.199
- She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
- What did you do?

03:53.360 --> 03:57.353
I told her I was out of soda. I went out
to get some, and I never went back.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.517
- All night?
- Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.191
- And she wants to break up with you.
- Can you believe it?

04:08.200 --> 04:10.714
I'm supposed to be having lunch
with her now at Pomodoro.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.276
Everybody breaks up at Pomodoros.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.829
- So, what am I gonna do?
- You really like this girl.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.116
No, I like the ball.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.396
This is my one chance
to make a great entrance.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.028
My whole life, I've never made
a great entrance.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.509
You've made some fine exits.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.152
So, what?
You can't keep avoiding her.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.514
Why not?

04:29.680 --> 04:32.558
If she can't find me,
she can't break up with me.

04:32.720 --> 04:37.589
And if we're still going out,
she has to go to the ball.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.635
Hey. Oh, listen, did you get
my ticket from Allison?

04:40.800 --> 04:41.994
- Right here.
- All right.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.071
Courtside.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.719
Don't let this girl get away.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.190
She'll have to find me first.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.596
Oh, by the way, you owe Mike $100.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.035
- What for?
- I bet for you on tonight's game.

04:58.200 --> 05:02.637
Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers
by more than 35, it pays 10-1.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.836
That's some sweet action.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.196
But I don't want any sweet action.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.079
Well, I couldn't do it.
I got a gambling problem.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.673
So you put down my money?

05:12.440 --> 05:14.317
You don't have a problem.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.516
Not with that, no.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.028
Susie.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.756
Susie.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.671
Hi, Peggy.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.592
Look, I should have
said this yesterday...

05:29.760 --> 05:31.751
Did you get this memo
from Elaine Benes?

05:31.920 --> 05:35.515
You know, it's amazing
Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.910
She practically ran the company
into the ground.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.038
Well, I thought
she did a pretty good job.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.589
I heard she was a disaster, Suz.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.832
Lookit. It's not Suz, all right?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.150
It's Susie.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.869
My name is Susie.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.279
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

06:03.440 --> 06:07.115
Please leave a message
At the beep

06:07.280 --> 06:09.953
I must be out
Or I'd pick up the phone

06:10.600 --> 06:13.592
Where could I be?

06:13.760 --> 06:18.072
Believe it or not, I'm not home

06:18.240 --> 06:20.390
Pick up.
I know you're screening for Allison.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.952
- Hey.
- So coffee shop?

06:23.120 --> 06:25.680
No, I can't. She knows I go there.
It's not secure.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.877
Hey, I got another call coming in.
I gotta let the machine get it. Bye.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.713
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

06:34.880 --> 06:38.589
Please leave a message
At the beep

06:38.760 --> 06:41.832
I must be out
Or I'd pick up the phone

06:42.000 --> 06:44.958
Where could I be?

06:45.120 --> 06:49.591
Believe it or not, I'm not home

06:49.760 --> 06:52.354
George, are you there?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.518
I hate that stupid message.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.591
I know you're av oiding me.
I'm at the office.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.513
Please call me.
I've gotta talk to you.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.674
Hi, Allison.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.876
Oh, I guess you're not at home.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.508
I probably should have
tried you at the office.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.477
Anyway, good to hear from you.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.279
Really looking forward to the ball.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.199
Can you believe this woman?

07:25.360 --> 07:29.512
The nerve. Talking about you behind
your back, and right to your face.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.390
No. Suz.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.758
I mean, Susie,
Suzanne, Susanna. Fine.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.879
But there is no way
I'm gonna be a Suz.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.314
No. No Suz.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.234
I mean, what am I? Some pom-pom
waving, back-seat bimbo?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.913
- Who are you describing?
- Someone.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.911
- Named Suz?
- No, still Sharon.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.911
- Hey.
- Hey, I thought you went to the game.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.753
No, I was kicked out for fighting
with one of the players.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.718
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Who?
- Reggie Miller.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.393
- Cheryl Miller's brother?
- Yeah.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.711
Hey, hey, hey. Wait. Wait. Wait.
What happened?

08:03.880 --> 08:07.998
Well, first of all, for some reason,
they started the game an hour late.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.310
And, I don't know,
I was sitting next to Spike Lee.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.948
He and Reggie were jawing
at each other. I got involved.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.317
Wait. Wait. Wait.
What do you mean, "involved"?

08:16.480 --> 08:20.632
Well, I ran out onto the court
and threw a hot dog at Reggie Miller.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.518
Involved.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.114
Then they threw me and Reggie
and Spike out of the game.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.874
So that's it?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.157
Well, you know, I felt pretty bad
about everything.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.072
Then the three of us
went to a strip club.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.714
Can you believe that?

08:36.880 --> 08:40.509
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's
little brother played basketball.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.557
Knicks killed them, 110-73.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.711
Well, without Reggie Miller,
it's a blowout.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.313
No, Jerry, that's 37 points.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.913
The Knicks covered. You won.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.153
See, that's a cool G, daddy-o.
Now, you gotta let it ride.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.269
- On what?
- Jerry, I don't wanna lose this feeling.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.476
Let's go to the OTB,
put money on the ponies.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.232
Yeah, all right.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.631
- They just closed.
- Oh, too bad.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.072
Mr. Peterman,
you wanted to see me?

09:06.560 --> 09:08.869
Apparently Peggy down in Design...

09:09.040 --> 09:13.272
...got into a little bit of a tiff yesterday
with somebody named Susie.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.712
- Susie.
- Yes.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.759
And between you, me and
the lamppost, and the desk...

09:19.920 --> 09:22.639
...Peggy says this Suz
isn't much of a worker.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.798
It's Susie.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.714
Nevertheless, Elaine,
the house of Peterman is in disorder.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.792
First thing tomorrow morning,
I wanna see you, Peggy and Susie...

09:31.960 --> 09:33.678
...right here in my office.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.753
All of us?

09:42.520 --> 09:43.714
Allison, hi.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.678
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened
at the game last night.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.239
Could I have that ticket tonight?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.595
The Rockets are in town
and that Hakeem Olajuwon...

09:50.760 --> 09:52.637
...he's got a real attitude.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.436
Kramer, have you seen
George around?

09:55.600 --> 09:57.750
- I can't get ahold of him.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.992
Well, he visits the guy across the hall
from me like every 10 minutes.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.072
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

10:05.240 --> 10:06.878
Hey, Jerry.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.951
Hey, Mike.
How about those Knicks?

10:09.120 --> 10:10.838
How about them?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.639
- Look, Jerry, I can't pay you.
- Why not?

10:13.800 --> 10:17.031
- Because I don't have the money.
- Mike, you say you're a bookie...

10:17.200 --> 10:19.111
...you take a bet
and then you can't pay.

10:19.280 --> 10:23.114
I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds
a little, how you say, phoney.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.919
Just give me till Friday.
Please, please?

10:26.080 --> 10:28.150
You know, you're supposed
to be the bookie.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.232
- Act like one.
- I'm sorry.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.755
Here, let me give you
a hand with that.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.799
- There's something wrong this trunk.
- Oh, let me see.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.756
So, Kramer,
why'd you ask me out to dinner?

10:44.280 --> 10:45.713
And why Pomodoro?

10:45.880 --> 10:48.633
How could you say that to me?

10:48.800 --> 10:52.679
Allison spoke to me
and she wanted me to speak to you.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.832
Now, we all know
that this relationship isn't working.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.630
So Allison and I think that the best
thing to do is just make a clean break.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.392
Can't we discuss this?

11:04.560 --> 11:08.155
We just don't think you're ready
for a serious relationship.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.870
I didn't even know
you wanted to get serious.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.110
So, what am I in this for?

11:14.080 --> 11:18.756
You know, I'm getting to a point in
my life where I need something more...

11:18.920 --> 11:21.115
...than just a good time.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.478
- Are you?
- What, me?

11:24.640 --> 11:25.959
No, no.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.348
But she is.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.117
I can't believe this is happening.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.874
George, we're sorry.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.234
We're through.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.072
Kramer, please.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.430
I'm sorry.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.752
Mr. Peterman, Peggy.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.912
I guess we should
just get this over with.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.877
Just hold on a minute.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.712
We're still one short.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.589
No, we're not.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.955
Susie has been very rude to me.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.797
Well, Elaine has nothing
but good things to say about Susie.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.030
Look.

12:04.200 --> 12:09.991
We don't have to name names
or point fingers...

12:10.160 --> 12:12.435
...or name names.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.513
Me and her have had our problems.
She and I have had our problems.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.194
You and I and she and you.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.874
Don't you drag me into this.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.156
This is between you
and her and her.

12:26.320 --> 12:30.916
Yes. And I am convinced
that if she were here with us today...

12:31.080 --> 12:33.355
...she would agree with me too.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.399
- Who?
- Her.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.870
- Where is she?
- This is part of the problem.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.235
I thought I was part of this problem.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.868
You're a huge part of the problem.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.637
But I think that at its core...

12:48.800 --> 12:51.519
...this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem...

12:51.680 --> 12:55.434
...that requires
a Susie-and-Elaine solution.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.478
And who better to do that than...

12:59.600 --> 13:03.115
...Elaine and Susie,
Susie and Elaine.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.439
Well, now that we have
that cleared up...

13:07.600 --> 13:09.670
...why don't the three of us
have lunch?

13:10.240 --> 13:11.753
What?

13:12.800 --> 13:14.631
Oh, I'm coming.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.870
I gotta go.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.797
She is the best.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.274
What was your name again?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.078
Mike's outside. He wants to talk.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.719
Then why doesn't he just come in?

13:29.880 --> 13:33.031
- Because he's scared, Jerry.
- Why is he scared?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.111
Come on, Mike.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.591
- Did you do this?
- Yeah, but...

13:40.560 --> 13:42.949
- You broke his thumbs.
- It was an accident.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.113
Is that what you call it
when somebody doesn't pay up?

13:47.280 --> 13:50.636
I'll get the money. I got a hundred
in my pocket if you wanna reach in.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.358
I don't want it that way.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.956
Okay, how about Mike fixes your trunk,
we call it even, nobody has to get hurt.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.315
- Fine.
- Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.075
I won't forget this. I'm gonna
fix your trunk good. Real good.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.950
See, that was nice, Jerry.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.792
Oh, by the way, I broke your trunk.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.313
It's just a car.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.990
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.157
- It's funny running into you here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.548
It's funny.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.994
You look good.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.158
Do I? Thanks.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.709
- You too.
- Oh, yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.230
It's getting kind of late.
I really have to be going.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.072
- Yeah.
- So it's nice seeing you again.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.959
Hey, you know,
maybe I'll call you sometime.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.714
George, it's over. It's just...

14:59.880 --> 15:01.029
It's over.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.074
What do you think, Jerry?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.993
I don't know,
I just see you guys together.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.754
Stupid thumbs.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.790
Somebody help. Help!

15:31.920 --> 15:33.114
So Peterman bought it?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.475
I can't believe
you got away with that.

15:35.640 --> 15:39.110
Well, I'm very fortunate
to be surrounded by such stupidity.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.713
Yeah, I know how you feel.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.594
Help!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.670
- You hear something?
- What?

15:45.840 --> 15:47.671
Jerry.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.273
Jerry.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.635
Oh, the trunk's broken. It's rattling.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.234
Jerry, I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.709
They're starting to give Susie
assignments now.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.110
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Eliminate her.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.474
What?

16:00.640 --> 16:02.198
Get rid of Susie.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.157
Make her disappear.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.550
- But I kind of like her.
- She's gone.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.312
- Jerry.
- Gone.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.429
The bumper sticker.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.191
Oh, God, I'm in trouble.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.309
Kramer, open up.
I know you're in there.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.514
George?

16:27.680 --> 16:30.319
Come on. It's 5:00 in the morning.
What's the matter with you?

16:30.480 --> 16:32.357
It's only 4.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.193
I've been walking around all night.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.796
I've been thinking about Allison
and me and you.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.353
Come on, George.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.909
Please, give me another chance.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.719
I know I'm gonna regret this.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.794
All right.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.158
Thank you.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.392
- I'm gonna make you both so happy.
- Okay. All right. I'll see you later.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.919
Elaine, where's Susie?

17:02.080 --> 17:05.310
I want her to head up our new
fingerless-glove division.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.435
I thought I was in line
for that assignment.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.953
No.

17:11.319 --> 17:14.153
All right, then, I was gonna wait
to tell you this...

17:15.640 --> 17:18.029
...but last night, Susie...

17:19.160 --> 17:21.355
She took her own life.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.158
- We're taking George back.
- What?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.072
He's gonna make us very happy.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.757
Look at this turnout.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.276
Where did Susie find the time
to meet all these people?

17:42.440 --> 17:45.750
My real funeral's
not gonna come close to this.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.916
Oh, my God.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.116
Susie?

17:51.280 --> 17:53.589
I'm not Susie. I'm Elaine.

17:53.760 --> 17:58.788
- But I've been calling you Susie.
- Hadn't noticed. Excuse me.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.752
I guess I never met Susie.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.558
Suz?

18:06.160 --> 18:08.594
I actually had a little thing
with her for a while.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.032
Her too.

18:16.200 --> 18:20.034
What can you say
about a girl like Susie?

18:58.840 --> 19:00.637
Hey.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.228
- Where's Allison?
- No, Allison, she didn't wanna come.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.674
But you took me back.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.957
Well, yeah, I did,
but she's a tough nut.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.394
How do you like the tuxedo?

19:10.560 --> 19:12.630
It's a rental,
but I've had it for 15 years.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.550
- All right.
- Where are you going?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.119
The ball, silly.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.669
No, no, no.
You're not going in there.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.600
George, I thought
you were gonna change.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.996
For her, not for you.

19:26.520 --> 19:29.193
Let's just try and have
a nice time for once.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.952
We'll talk about this
when we get home.

19:31.120 --> 19:36.638
All right, look. Wait. Wait. Kramer.
Wait a minute. You are not going in.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.671
What an entrance.

19:44.520 --> 19:48.798
- And who might this be?
- Oh, I'm with him. Yeah.

19:50.840 --> 19:57.029
And also much like me,
Susie hated going to the market.

19:57.200 --> 20:03.070
- Elaine, may I say a few words?
- Oh, God, yes, Mr. Peterman.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.197
I don't think I'll ever
be able to forget Susie.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.600
And most of all,
I will never forget that one night...

20:11.760 --> 20:13.716
...working late on the catalogue...

20:13.880 --> 20:18.158
...just the two of us,
and we surrendered to temptation.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.149
And it was pretty good.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.839
Yeah, but he didn't sleep
with both of them.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.348
But I never heard her cries for help...

20:35.520 --> 20:38.796
...and now Susie is gone.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.359
Hold on!

20:40.920 --> 20:43.070
Susie didn't commit suicide.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.796
She was murdered...

20:45.960 --> 20:48.235
...by Jerry Seinfeld!

20:50.280 --> 20:52.669
Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.353
Elaine, guess what.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.993
I've decided to form a charitable
foundation in Susie's honour...

21:10.160 --> 21:13.038
...and as Susie's best friend,
I want you to be involved.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.789
Mr. Peterman...

21:16.640 --> 21:18.790
...l'm Susie.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.552
She's me.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.878
I feel the same way.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.192
And that's why this foundation
will meet around your schedule.

21:29.360 --> 21:33.990
Nights, weekends,
every free moment you have.

21:37.200 --> 21:43.435
Suz!
