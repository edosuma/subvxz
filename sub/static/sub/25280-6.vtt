01:02.187 --> 01:03.146
Keith.

01:05.355 --> 01:06.191
Keith.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.655
Keith.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.658
Keith.

01:17.368 --> 01:22.207
-Where are you, Shiro? Show yourself!
- I know this must be confusing for you.

01:22.791 --> 01:28.546
What is this place? Where are we?
You-- you were trying to kill me.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.549
The others!
You-- you said you...

01:44.813 --> 01:48.942
I'm not here to harm you.
Everyone is fine.

01:49.776 --> 01:55.406
Just let me explain.
The thing that attacked you wasn't me.

01:56.741 --> 02:00.328
Since my fight with Zarkon,
I've been here.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.290
-When you disappeared?
-Yes.

02:05.291 --> 02:09.461
I didn't know where I was
or how much time had passed.

02:10.588 --> 02:15.093
My physical form was gone.
I existed on another realm.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.096
I died, Keith.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.478
But the Black Lion
somehow retained my essence.

02:26.229 --> 02:31.401
Is... Is that where we are?
In the Black Lion's consciousness?

02:32.443 --> 02:35.405
I tried to warn the others
about the imposter while on Olkarion,

02:35.488 --> 02:37.991
but our connection
wasn't strong enough...

02:40.827 --> 02:41.661
Shiro?

02:43.121 --> 02:43.955
Shiro!

02:56.551 --> 02:57.760
You saved us.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.613
Uh, this doesn't seem safe.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.573
I don't have time for safety.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.117
I need to get the Castle of Lions
back up and running.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.329
Diverting power to the main turbine
might be the only way!

03:24.412 --> 03:26.706
What are the chances bolts
of magic electricity

03:26.789 --> 03:29.000
are gonna shoot everywhere
once it gets started?

03:29.083 --> 03:32.337
Hopefully, the chances are good.
That's what we want to happen.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.588
What?

03:35.006 --> 03:38.426
We really need to work
on our safety procedures.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.346
How's it going, number five?

03:41.429 --> 03:45.016
I've diverted as much power from the
teladuv to the main turbine as I could.

03:45.099 --> 03:49.812
Nice work! Looks like we have the power
we need to attempt a system restart.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.898
Allura, begin the reboot sequence.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.361
Allura, can you hear me?
Is this thing on mute?

03:56.444 --> 03:59.948
There's a lot of blood rushing to my head.
I keep hitting the wrong buttons.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.534
-Allura?
-Oh, right. What is it you need?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.746
The reboot sequence. Can you run it again?

04:17.714 --> 04:21.678
Allura has begun the sequence.
Power should be flowing any tick.

04:21.761 --> 04:22.595
Any tick?

04:25.682 --> 04:28.810
Ugh! What?
We're in worse shape than I thought.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.063
Looks like we hit another snag.
Hold tight!

04:32.146 --> 04:34.649
I'll head down to assist with repairs.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.494
Allura, are you okay?
You seem a little distracted.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.456
I'm just so angry with myself
for allowing this to happen.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.500
I played right into Lotor's hands,

04:52.583 --> 04:55.712
and I fear my actions have placed us
in this dire situation.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.839
You didn't put us in this situation.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.883
It was Shiro who went rogue
and released the virus on the Castle.

05:01.217 --> 05:05.054
No, this is my fault. I trusted Lotor.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.224
I helped him build and empower his ships,

05:08.308 --> 05:11.227
granting him unlimited access
to the quintessence field.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.815
I was fooled by him, and it put
the entire universe in jeopardy.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.652
How can the coalition ever be expected
to trust me

05:19.736 --> 05:22.322
when I'm not sure I can trust myself?

05:23.114 --> 05:27.201
Allura, it wasn't just you
who trusted Lotor. We all did.

05:27.285 --> 05:32.373
I had more reason than anyone not
to trust him, but he did everything right.

05:32.457 --> 05:36.252
He didn't just fool you. He fooled us all.

05:41.382 --> 05:45.011
Let me tell you, as someone
who's made a million mistakes...

05:45.553 --> 05:48.389
all you can do is get up
and try to make it right.

05:48.473 --> 05:54.187
You can't doubt yourself now.
We need you. The universe needs you.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.315
Thank you, Lance.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.904
Hailing the Castle of Lions.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.823
-This is Keith.
-Keith! You're okay!

06:05.907 --> 06:11.537
-Where've you been? Did you get Shiro?
-I got him, but not the Shiro we know.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.706
The Shiro that took Lotor was a clone.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.876
Well, then where's the real one?

06:16.959 --> 06:18.169
It's complicated.

06:18.252 --> 06:21.756
I'll explain everything later,
but right now, you need to focus on Lotor.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.175
I've picked up the Sincline ships
on my scanners.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.469
Looks like Lotor's headed back
to your position.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.970
Right where you are.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.556
He needs to get back
into the quintessence field.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.644
I'm on my way to you now. But without
a wormhole, it's gonna take me a while.

06:34.727 --> 06:38.231
- You'll have to hold off Lotor without me.
- We'll do what we can.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.402
Shiro, if you're here,
I could use your help.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.238
I need to get to the team before Lotor.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.788
Accessing the quintessence field
has been

06:53.871 --> 06:55.915
Lotor's singular drive for millennia.

06:55.998 --> 07:00.211
He wants to harness the power for himself,
but we cannot let him.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.882
Thankfully, there's only one way
into the quintessence field.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.968
Through the inter-reality gate.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.679
So we must destroy it.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.056
I'll work on the Castle,

07:12.140 --> 07:14.225
to get it up and running
before Lotor arrives.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.353
It'll be slow going without the paladins,
but we'll get it done.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.646
Good luck, Coran.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.774
We'll need all the help we can get
in the fight against Lotor.

07:29.782 --> 07:33.369
Zethrid, Ezor, my deepest apologies
for lying to you both,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.538
but in order to gain the princess' trust

07:35.621 --> 07:39.959
and make the Paladins of Voltron believe
we were truly at odds, it had to be done.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.378
I'm just glad we're on your side.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.298
As long as I get to blow something up,
I'm good.

07:45.381 --> 07:49.719
Excellent. Today, we will gain access
to unlimited quintessence,

07:49.802 --> 07:53.181
and together,
we usher in a new era of power.

08:00.563 --> 08:05.651
- Are you sure about this?
- We must. It's the only way.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.556
Lotor will be here any second.
What's the plan?

08:35.640 --> 08:38.851
The Castle of Lions is broken down.
So there's no help there.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.562
The Black Lion isn't with us,
so we can't form Voltron.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.648
We're just going to
have to do what we can.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.567
Got it. Attempt to survive.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.903
Last time we fought Lotor,
we had five ships

08:48.986 --> 08:51.697
and Lotor had two,
and he still kicked our butts.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.825
This time, he's gonna have three ships,
and we only have four.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.537
Does-- does anyone else see
where I'm going with this?

08:57.620 --> 09:00.623
Hunk, no one's interested
in your math equations.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.334
Especially ones
that add to us taking a beating.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.629
-Coran, how are the repairs coming?
- I'm working on 'em, Princess.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.094
The problem is we need power for
the systems that start the main turbine.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.513
But if I use that power
to engage the systems,

09:15.596 --> 09:17.848
I don't have power
to run the main turbine.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.058
It's a conundrum.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.229
Coran, without the Castle of
Lions backing us up, we might not make it.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.734
Right. No pressure. Come on, Coran, think!

09:28.818 --> 09:33.573
I've got Krolia to help me... and Romelle
and the space mice and a cosmic wolf.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.749
Okay, all--

10:02.727 --> 10:06.147
Hieronymus Wimbleton?
My grandfather's tool kit!

10:12.194 --> 10:16.532
And a 10,000-year-old bottle of nunville.
Yep, that's Pop-Pop Wimbleton.

10:17.241 --> 10:22.330
Hieronymus Wimbleton. All I've ever wanted
to do was live up to your great name.

10:22.830 --> 10:27.585
When I first saw your Castle of Lions take
to the sky, I knew anything was possible.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.712
Now I'm not so sure.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.841
Wait a tick.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.427
We got incoming.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.436
Guys, they're here.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.856
Hold your positions.
Let Lotor make the first move.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.499
Lotor, the gate. It's destroyed.

11:15.883 --> 11:19.762
We need not fight today.
We are all on the same side.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.057
I know what you all must think of me
now that you know my past.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.394
It doesn't have to change
our future together.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.356
The truth is, I want to harness the power
of the quintessence field

11:30.439 --> 11:32.942
to better the universe, just like I said.

11:33.025 --> 11:38.197
-Nothing has changed.
-You enslaved countless Alteans.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.741
Harnessed their life source
for your own personal gain.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.620
-How many innocent lives did you destroy?
-Allura, I--

11:44.704 --> 11:45.579
How many?

11:48.374 --> 11:50.626
It's true. Many Alteans perished

11:50.710 --> 11:53.671
in my quest to unlock the mysteries
of quintessence.

11:53.754 --> 11:58.759
But I protected thousands more,
and I rescued their culture, our culture.

11:59.385 --> 12:03.180
Why is he pleading with the paladins?
Why are we not opening fire?

12:03.305 --> 12:07.184
I stopped trying to understand
Lotor's master plan long ago.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.477
Too complicated.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.357
Allura, you must understand,
I've given everything I have

12:13.441 --> 12:15.943
to plumb the depths
of King Alfor's knowledge

12:16.026 --> 12:18.112
to unlock the mysteries of Oriande.

12:18.195 --> 12:21.490
Please, Allura,
we've come too far together.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.827
Surely, you can see the greatness
we've already accomplished.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.454
There's still more to come.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.415
Join me. We're on the same side.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.793
No, we're not!

12:37.173 --> 12:38.924
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

12:44.180 --> 12:45.306
Allura, stop!

12:45.765 --> 12:49.477
You and I hold the ancient knowledge
of our Altean culture.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.938
We were meant to be together.
My feelings for you are true.

12:53.022 --> 12:58.277
-I know you have feelings for me as well.
-You betrayed and used me.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.697
You're more like Zarkon
than I could have imagined.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.244
What about your father?

13:07.328 --> 13:09.163
He may have been a master engineer,

13:09.246 --> 13:11.749
but Alfor was too weak
to defend his home world.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.753
I'm the one who had to step up
and save our entire race.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.713
Who are you to question my tactics

13:17.797 --> 13:20.716
in bringing peace and prosperity
to the universe?

13:22.801 --> 13:24.595
Destroy the lions.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.728
Allura, stay with the group!

14:03.592 --> 14:07.513
Coran, we need your help here! Please
tell me you got the Castle up and running!

14:07.596 --> 14:10.683
I'm working on it!
Krolia, get ready!

14:10.766 --> 14:13.936
The combination of the fermented nunville
with the energy core

14:14.019 --> 14:17.690
should jump-start the main turbine
without using the Castle's power.

14:17.773 --> 14:22.278
Ready. Are you sure setting off
a bomb in the turbine is a good idea?

14:22.361 --> 14:25.948
No, I'm not sure it's a good idea,
but it's our only idea.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.002
Here goes nothing. Or everything.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.875
Coran, are you there?
It worked! We got an engine online!

15:17.958 --> 15:19.793
Whoo-hoo!

15:19.877 --> 15:21.712
Thank you, Pop-Pop Wimbleton!

15:27.468 --> 15:29.553
Don't worry, guys, I'm here!

15:44.068 --> 15:48.572
-Coran, what's going on with the Castle?
-We've got one of the engines working,

15:48.656 --> 15:51.283
so I'm kind of learning to fly
all over again.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.839
Once I wipe out Voltron,
I'm going to start a new Altea.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.760
An Altea that will never know
of Princess Allura or King Alfor.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.513
Nor will they know
of the Lions of Voltron.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.432
All they'll know is me,
their great leader!

16:22.106 --> 16:25.484
I'm ready to wipe the universe clean
of all my enemies.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.696
Voltron, Haggar
and the rest of the Galra.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.454
I think it's time to sever our ties
with Lotor for good.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.915
Disengage from the battle, follow my lead.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.174
Even my generals betray me.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.281
Lotor, don't do this!

17:44.229 --> 17:48.275
- What is that thing?
- He's created his own Voltron.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.903
That is why he was using me.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.529
I helped him build it.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.949
Well, the good news is
it's now four on one.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.379
This ends now.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.552
Look out!

18:20.891 --> 18:22.768
It's way faster than us!

18:29.149 --> 18:32.861
I think I've finally got control!
Ready the weapons systems!

18:32.945 --> 18:36.281
We don't have much power.
Probably just enough for one shot.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.451
Well, then let's make it count. Fire!

18:48.168 --> 18:49.545
Coran, nice shot!

19:04.143 --> 19:08.522
Impossible! Lotor's weapon has
completely repelled the Castle's attack!

19:16.488 --> 19:21.410
- Coran, shoot it again!
- I can't. That was our last shot.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.662
Pidge,
get out of his line of sight!

19:23.745 --> 19:27.124
He's locked onto me.
I'm taking heavy fire!

19:27.207 --> 19:30.544
Get out of there! I'm coming in!
Form jaw-blade!

19:30.627 --> 19:33.380
- Lance!
- We can't take this much longer!

19:33.964 --> 19:37.926
Shiro, I have to get to the paladins.
I need your help.

19:39.845 --> 19:40.804
Shiro.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.265
Shiro.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.727
Shiro!

19:58.530 --> 20:04.119
Keith, you can get to them,
but you must see them first.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.038
But how?

20:07.915 --> 20:13.670
See through the lion's eyes.
Patience yields focus.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.528
I see them.

21:20.362 --> 21:24.783
It didn't have to end like this,
but you've made your choice.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.565
Keith, how did you
get here so fast?
