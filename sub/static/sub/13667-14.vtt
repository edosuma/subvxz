<i>Tonight on st. Elsewhere.</i>

00:04.400 --> 00:06.458
What happened to these guys?
Street Fight.

00:06.525 --> 00:08.427
Some paddies jumped us.
I love urban Living.

00:11.041 --> 00:12.792
Hi, boys. I'm Dee.

00:12.859 --> 00:14.166
She came through this door,

00:14.233 --> 00:17.375
<i>tossed these flowers at me,
and then whammo.</i>

00:17.442 --> 00:18.977
Hi there!

00:19.044 --> 00:22.113
I know better than anyone
what's going on inside my body.

00:22.180 --> 00:25.116
Please, have the decency
to pay me that respect.

00:25.183 --> 00:28.620
<i>He got beat up...
by some negroes.</i>

00:28.687 --> 00:30.121
You have every right
to be angry.

00:30.188 --> 00:32.457
A liver specialist
Should know Better.

00:32.524 --> 00:33.925
Hi, Helen.
She did it again.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.427
The flasher?
Mm-hmm.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.896
Oh!

02:08.419 --> 02:11.021
<i>[ Fiscus ]
There are laws to protect
the innocent, Chandler.</i>

02:11.089 --> 02:13.024
<i>I'm thinking of
Getting myself a lawyer.</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:15.760
<i>[ Chandler ]
you can't afford
a lawyer, Fiscus.</i>

02:15.827 --> 02:17.762
<i>[ Fiscus ]
They've got law firms
in the yellow pages...</i>

02:17.829 --> 02:20.765
<i>that you don't have to
pay a dime unless
they take the case.</i>

02:20.832 --> 02:24.102
Even then you don't pay anything
unless they win and you collect.

02:24.169 --> 02:27.906
Sort of an incentive to Sue
your neighbor. Or landlord,
as the case may be.

02:27.973 --> 02:31.109
[ Chandler ]
did the landlord tell you
he was gonna sell the house?

02:31.176 --> 02:33.111
I guess he did.
When?

02:33.178 --> 02:36.114
I don't know. A while ago.
Recently?

02:36.181 --> 02:38.116
What is this?
The inquisition?

02:38.183 --> 02:41.119
All right. Six months ago.
But just because
he owns the building,

02:41.186 --> 02:43.321
that doesn't
give him the right--
the moral right--

02:43.388 --> 02:46.391
To disrupt my life
in this totally selfish,
mercenary and cavalier fashion.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.827
When do you have to move?
Tomorrow.

02:48.894 --> 02:50.896
Tomorrow?
Well, who reads those notices?

02:50.962 --> 02:54.499
I thought he was bluffing.
You know, some excuse
to Jack up the rent.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.669
You got an extra bed?

02:57.736 --> 03:00.305
No. Sorry. I sleep
on a Murphy as it is.

<i>[ chattering ]

Maybe you can find something.</i>

03:03.475 --> 03:06.077
I got my car out of here.
You got a new car?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.380
Yeah.
'72 buick station Wagon.
Drives like a boat.

03:08.446 --> 03:10.382
Can I sleep in the back?

03:10.448 --> 03:12.651
Fiscus, put on your apron.
You got a customer.

03:12.717 --> 03:15.287
Clients, Daniels.
Butchers have customers.

03:15.353 --> 03:17.856
Physicians have clients.
That's what I mean.

03:17.923 --> 03:20.392
<i>Okay. What have we got?
My Brother.</i>

03:20.458 --> 03:22.394
Where's it hurt?
[ Groans ]

03:22.460 --> 03:24.729
get the Gurney.
Can you move your arms?
[ Groans ]

03:24.796 --> 03:27.098
hey!
I gotta examine him.
Help me get him up.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.903
You gotta do something for him
right away. He's messed up.
Open your eye.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.840
And your other eye.
Okay. Your mouth.
Open your mouth.

03:34.906 --> 03:37.008
[ groans ]
you gotta jam that stick
in his mouth?

03:37.075 --> 03:40.212
His tooth is broken.
I don't know if the blood's
coming from there or what.

03:40.278 --> 03:43.849
Okay. Help me get him
on the Gurney.
What happened?

03:43.915 --> 03:45.951
He got jumped by
a couple niggers.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.520
Daniels, get x-Rays. Chest,
abdomen, cervical/lumbar spine.

03:48.587 --> 03:50.856
And a facial series?

03:50.922 --> 03:53.692
The works. Looks like nose
and ribs are broken.
God knows what else.

03:53.758 --> 03:56.294
Find out where the bleeding
in his mouth is from.
Right.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.830
Know the guys who jumped him?
No, but I'm gonna find out.

03:58.897 --> 04:01.366
Have a seat.
We'll be with you in a minute.

04:15.180 --> 04:16.815
[ grunts ]

04:31.830 --> 04:33.832
ah!
[ Laughing ]

04:33.899 --> 04:35.834
One more set.
No, no.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.904
I think I better quit while I'm
still ahead and you're still--
Alive.

04:38.970 --> 04:41.506
Precisely.
Thanks a lot.
[ chuckles ]

04:41.573 --> 04:43.742
best not do too--
Too much at first,
you know.

04:43.808 --> 04:47.179
At my advanced age,
you mean.
Well--

04:47.245 --> 04:50.148
Why couldn't you be
a little more patronizing
on the court, Daniel?

04:50.215 --> 04:53.385
Drop a point or two now
and then, just so it wouldn't
look so darn easy.

04:53.451 --> 04:55.754
I have too much respect
for you, Donald.
[ Chuckles ]

04:55.820 --> 04:57.923
besides, I hate to lose.
I noticed.

04:57.989 --> 05:01.793
I'm a bad loser.
Always have been.
Makes me cranky and sour.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.129
On the other hand,
I'm a wonderful Winner.

05:04.196 --> 05:08.200
Gracious, compassionate.
You don't gloat.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.302
Can I buy you
a hearty breakfast?
Good idea.

05:10.368 --> 05:12.904
I need something to confront
the young ones this morning.

05:12.971 --> 05:16.541
I'm supervising a lecture
Dr. Cavanero is giving
to the first-year residents.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.543
Ah.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.713
Well, now, Donald, we'll
have to play again soon.
But not too soon.

05:21.780 --> 05:25.817

Well, just a little.

Dear John letter?
No.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.940
Dr. Auschlander
wants to recommend me

05:49.007 --> 05:51.476
Hey. That's terrific.
Yeah.

05:51.543 --> 05:55.247
Thing is, I thought that
wodehouse fellowships were, uh,
part of the old boy network.

05:55.313 --> 05:59.184
Apparently They've been under
a lot of pressure to bring in
an old girl or two.

05:59.251 --> 06:02.220
I think you'd make
a fine old girl.
Thanks a Lot.

06:02.287 --> 06:04.656
Look. It's one of the top

Could you open your eyes
and look straight ahead for me?

06:48.633 --> 06:51.636
How'd you sleep?
Not so well.

06:52.938 --> 06:55.507
Every time I coughed,
tears came to my eyes.

06:55.574 --> 06:57.542
Well, you got
three cracked ribs,

06:57.609 --> 07:00.178

and your kidneys have taken
a real beating.

Yeah. Yeah. I--

the right doctor,

recommended you.

if I want to spend
that much time in research.

It's nice to have
a little body Contact.

10:17.342 --> 10:21.913
[ sighs ] I was under
the impression that as I got
older, it would get easier.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.356

10:31.423 --> 10:34.960
No. I think you have
a legitimate concern.

is too short to live it for
anyone other than yourself.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.166

13:13.351 --> 13:16.021

her hair was brown.

13:18.156 --> 13:19.925
Well, it happened so quickly.

Well, father, I apologize
for any inconvenience
this might have caused you,

13:23.829 --> 13:26.331
and it's not gonna
happen again.

13:29.634 --> 13:32.437

and see if anyone's
missing from psych.

That's gonna shrink

And we feel
the best course to take, uh,

to stop the bleeding is to
remove the kidney surgically.

Well, your normal reaction

Light and color were like

At a gallery I mean.

39:30.262 --> 39:34.399
Oh, no.
She Revels in her
amateur standing.

39:34.466 --> 39:36.401
She paints for
the simple joy of it.

39:36.468 --> 39:39.905
If you were to come out
to the house and admire
one of her pieces,

39:39.971 --> 39:43.008

with it under your arm.

Yeah. Ran the city
from his jail Cell.

That's right.
Sure was good to his own kind.
I'll say that for him.

- A lot of people loved him.
- I tell you something.

If Curley was still
running things, guys like me
wouldn't be out of work.

Ain't any work anyway.
Not unless your skin's
