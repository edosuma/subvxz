I never let different foods
touch when they're on my plate.

20:11.965 --> 20:14.689
Way number 20--
- [gasps] I'm done!

20:14.758 --> 20:17.413
- We have a winner.
- What?!

20:17.482 --> 20:18.758
Thanks for taking
so long to list

20:18.827 --> 20:20.448
all the ways you're
awesome, Jaget.

20:20.517 --> 20:22.862
- No! You tricked me!

20:22.931 --> 20:25.862
I would never do that
to anybody.

20:25.931 --> 20:27.172
Jaget out!

20:27.241 --> 20:30.034
- Not so fast.
I'm gonna need that belt.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.896
[laughter]

20:34.620 --> 20:37.206
And the winner of this year's
Suckdown is Presley!

[cheers and applause]

20:41.862 --> 20:44.172
- You must have the worst case
of brain freeze of all time.

20:44.241 --> 20:46.310
- No, it's not too--

20:49.931 --> 20:51.896
- Her brain just needs
a little time to thaw.

20:55.275 --> 20:57.068
- Well, Jaget,
since you lost,

20:57.137 --> 20:59.172
you have to drink
the muck shake.

21:02.206 --> 21:03.965
- No problem.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.965
Why is it hot?

21:14.344 --> 21:16.413
- Here, Munchy,
I want you to have this.

21:16.482 --> 21:18.551
- Thank you so much.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.103
But I was really hoping
to beat my big bro.

21:21.172 --> 21:23.310
- For the record, today
you didn't lose to him;

21:23.379 --> 21:24.827
you lost to me.

21:24.896 --> 21:27.000
And isn't that basically
the same thing as winning?

21:28.793 --> 21:31.482
- I'm not sure--but that does
make me feel better.

21:32.482 --> 21:34.586
And so does that.

21:34.655 --> 21:37.896
- [retching]
- Jaget, are you okay?

21:37.965 --> 21:39.448
- Don't look at me, Hans.

21:39.517 --> 21:42.482
- But I came from Norway.
- Go on, get!

21:46.206 --> 21:47.655
- Lex, I'm gonna let you

21:47.724 --> 21:49.413
take my selfie
with Cash the Cow.

21:49.482 --> 21:50.758
- For real?

21:50.827 --> 21:53.137
- Of course,
you're my bestie.

21:53.206 --> 21:55.172
And no one else I know wants
a picture with a cow.

21:55.241 --> 21:57.137
- We'll see about that.
