00:19.960 --> 00:22.920
I'm sorry. 
 I-- I didn't mean to scare you.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.520
- David, don't do that. 
 - I'm sorry.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.800
I just wanted to catch you 
 before the meeting, to, uh...

00:29.800 --> 00:31.720
To what?

00:34.080 --> 00:35.680
Happy Birthday.

00:35.680 --> 00:40.000
Oh, David, how did you know 
 my birthday is next week?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.160
I don't know what to say. 
 Um...

00:43.160 --> 00:44.960
thank you.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.760
- [DISTANT LAUGHTER] 
 - Um, we're late.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.680
- I'll open it after the meeting. 
 - OK.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.320
OK. Come on.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.960
- Ta-da! 
 - You're such a talent.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.240
You jerk! 
 I could have choked.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.840
Go ahead. 
 Take your best shot.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.400
Come on, guys, 
 lighten up.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.920
Sorry.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.520
What happened?

01:12.520 --> 01:14.680
You should have wanted 
 two more minutes.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.480
Eric was going to deck Frank.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.280
Yeah, in his dreams.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.880
Start fast. 
 The natives are restless.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.400
My story's got to do with 
 two kids who don't get along

01:33.400 --> 01:36.560
because they're so different 
 from each other...

01:36.560 --> 01:41.480
and a love that is so strong 
 it can survive anything,

01:41.480 --> 01:45.400
even death... forever.

01:47.160 --> 01:51.000
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.560
I call this story...

02:19.600 --> 02:22.040
[DAVID] It was the beginning 
 of summer vacation,

02:22.040 --> 02:24.920
and every kid in town 
 was psychoed--

02:24.920 --> 02:28.880
every kid except 
 Amanda Cameron, that is.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.640
We're here. 
 Everybody out.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.760
[DAVID] Her mom and dad 
 were some kind of scientists

02:37.760 --> 02:41.560
who had to travel up north 
 to study unuit stone carvings,

02:41.560 --> 02:44.960
so Amanda was shipped off 
 to her Aunt Dottie's place

02:44.960 --> 02:47.000
for the summer.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.880
Oops. Oh, shoot.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.080
Sweetie, what in the world 
 did your mother put in here?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.200
Books.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.680
Books? 
 Feels like you've got

02:55.680 --> 02:57.160
a whole set of encyclopedias.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.320
Beth!

03:01.040 --> 03:04.320
Beth, Lovey, 
 your cousin Amanda's here.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.600
Could you give us a hand? 
 Beth?

03:08.600 --> 03:10.760
She must be on the phone again.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.320
We'll just do this ourselves.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.600
[David] 
 Unfortunately for Amanda,

03:21.600 --> 03:24.480
spending a whole summer 
 with Cousin Bethy

03:24.480 --> 03:26.560
was going to be even less fun

03:26.560 --> 03:28.880
than staring at a bunch 
 of old rocks.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.400
with her mom and dad 
 for two months.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.840
I'll get this.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.640
[POUNDING]

03:35.640 --> 03:37.920
- What was that? 
 - What was what?

03:37.920 --> 03:40.480
It's like banging coming 
 from over there.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.240
Oh, not that place, sweetie.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.280
No one's been in there for years.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.320
I should know. 
 I'm the real estate agent.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.880
I can't even get people 
 to look at the place.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.440
I wish it would just--

03:53.440 --> 03:55.000
Huh!

04:00.040 --> 04:04.480
Sometimes I think this house 
 just doesn't want to be sold.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.600
Come on. Let's get you 
 inside and unpacked.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.200
You should see 
 what she's wearing.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.920
My mom better not expect me 
 to babysit that dweeb all summer.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.520
- [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 - Uh, she's here. I got to go.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.520
Look who's here, honey. 
 Come on in, Mandy.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.720
- Hi, Beth. 
 - Hi.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.320
You'll be sharing Beth's room 
 so the two of you

04:43.320 --> 04:45.960
can stay up all night 
 giggling and talking.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.560
This is where Nanny used 
 to sleep when Beth was little.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.760
Well, I'll leave you two 
 alone to get reacquainted.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.680
Have fun.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.440
I suppose she told you

04:59.440 --> 05:01.840
we're going to do 
 all sorts of fun stuff together.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.400
- Yeah. 
 - Wrong.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.760
If you think I'm going to 
 hang with you all summer,

05:07.760 --> 05:09.240
you're nuts.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.760
I don't think she means for you 
 to hang with just me.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.200
We could do stuff 
 with your friends.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.600
You don't even know my friends.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.880
They could get to know me.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.240
Why? It's not like just 
 anyone can hang with us.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.440
You have to prove 
 you're not a zeeb.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.920
How does one prove 
 that they're not a zeeb?

05:29.920 --> 05:32.880
OK, look. 
 You want to hang with us,

05:32.880 --> 05:36.560
- you got to follow the rules. 
 - What rules?

05:39.240 --> 05:41.240
OK, first off...

05:41.240 --> 05:44.200
I don't even want to 
 know that you're here.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.040
That means putting 
 my animal collection back

05:47.040 --> 05:49.720
every day in the exact right places.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.800
In fact, I don't feel 
 like having my room

05:52.800 --> 05:57.280
look like a disaster all day, 
 so do it now.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.920
And you can't go crying 
 to Mom or Nanny ever,

06:02.920 --> 06:05.080
no matter what happens.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.600
Fine. 
 I'll put everything back

06:06.600 --> 06:10.320
in the right order every day, 
 and I won't snitch.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.720
Easy.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.560
Then there's the most 
 important thing.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.560
What's that?

06:17.080 --> 06:18.720
The initiation.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.840
- Initiation? 
 - Oh, yeah.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.560
Anyone who hangs with us 
 has to spend a night alone

06:26.560 --> 06:29.040
in the place next door.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.680
It's haunted.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.160
Dear Mom and Dad,

06:43.160 --> 06:46.560
I hope you're having a good time.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.560
I am, too.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.280
[CREAKING]

07:05.480 --> 07:08.800
You must... be Amanda.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.160
I'm Nanny.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.470
No!

07:16.840 --> 07:19.040
If you touch her conteminated, 
 wrinkly old hand,

07:19.040 --> 07:22.040
I'll never let you touch 
 my things again!

07:37.640 --> 07:41.120
- Don't you ever talk to her! 
 - Who is she?

07:41.120 --> 07:43.480
My nanny, 
 and I want her gone.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.800
Why?

07:44.800 --> 07:48.160
Because I'm too old for a nanny, 
 and she's so weird.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.960
I hate how she's always 
 watching me.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.640
She seems kind of sad to me.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.640
She's crazy-- really crazy.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.000
I know for a fact there's 
 something funny with her

07:58.000 --> 07:59.960
and the haunted place next door.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.880
I heard my parents talking once.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.880
I think she must have been 
 driven insane by the ghost.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.960
Which reminds me--

08:07.960 --> 08:11.040
there's a pool party 
 at Sally's on Saturday.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.400
I suppose you want to come.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.920
- Sure. 
 - Don't get too excited.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.800
You can't come unless you 
 go through the initiation.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.360
- The night in the haunted house? 
 - You got it.

08:21.360 --> 08:25.200
Tomorrow night. 
 Pleasant dreams.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.000
Are you OK?

08:38.480 --> 08:40.880
You dropped this.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.440
Thank you.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.040
Is that Beth's laundry?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.880
Oh, that's OK. 
 It won't take me long.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.240
Don't worry. 
 I won't tell anyone.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.840
She's so weird, 
 and I'm too old for a nanny.

08:58.840 --> 09:03.080
Why doesn't she just leave? 
 I'm not going to argue.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.120
I told you before, 
 she has nowhere to go.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.120
I wish she did, 
 but she doesn't.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.840
There you are, honey.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.400
Sleeping in?

09:18.400 --> 09:20.680
Now. Beth, I don't want 
 to hear any more rudeness.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.800
[DOOR SQUEAKS]

09:26.160 --> 09:28.680
I'm going roller-skating.

Don't touch my stuff.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.880
[DOOR SLAMS]

09:38.760 --> 09:42.240
[AMANDA] Why does everyone 
 think it's haunted, anyway?

09:42.240 --> 09:44.920
[BETH] 
 They don't think it's haunted.

09:44.920 --> 09:49.120
They know it's haunted. 
 And this is why.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.400
A long, long time ago,

09:52.400 --> 09:54.880
there was a little girl 
 who lived there.

09:54.880 --> 09:59.000
All the kids made fun of her 
 because she couldn't talk.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.800
Why couldn't she talk?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.840
I don't know. 
 She just couldn't.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.560
Maybe she was deaf.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.640
It doesn't matter. 
 Just listen!

10:07.640 --> 10:09.400
Sorry.

10:10.120 --> 10:15.880
Anyway... one day, 
 her mom got a letter

10:15.880 --> 10:20.240
that her dad, 
 who was away in the war,

10:20.240 --> 10:24.320
has gotten sick, 
 so she sent the little girl

10:24.320 --> 10:25.880
to stay with her grandmother

10:25.880 --> 10:28.800
while she went away 
 to take care of him.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.680
- [OWL HOOTS] 
 - Only the little girl

10:31.680 --> 10:35.040
didn't make it to her grandmother's 
 because on the way,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.160
some mean kids surrounded her 
 and teased her.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.680
She ran back home 
 to get away from them,

10:42.680 --> 10:44.240
and they followed her,

10:44.240 --> 10:48.720
followed her right to 
 her very own home.

10:50.800 --> 10:56.560
They locked her in her bedroom, 
 and she didn't escape alive.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.960
What happened?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.600
No one knew she was there.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.480
her mother didn't come back 
 for weeks,

11:04.480 --> 11:07.560
and her grandmother didn't 
 even know she was coming.

11:07.560 --> 11:11.120
When they found her, 
 she was dead.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.240
And that's where you have to go-- 
 her bedroom.

11:18.240 --> 11:22.600
We'll know you're in there 
 by the light from this.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.720
The keys to the front door.

11:27.720 --> 11:31.440
- Won't Aunt Dottie miss them? 
 - No way.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.800
No one ever calls to see the place.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.000
It's just too scary.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.760
You could turn chicken

11:46.760 --> 11:51.200
if you'd rather spend the 
 whole summer alone... reading.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.840
No. I'm going in.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.720
I don't believe in ghosts anyway.

11:56.720 --> 12:01.280
Neither did we, until 
 we spent the night in there.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.600

Where did Beth go?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.560
Beth went to Sally's 
 for the whole night.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.080
Aunt Dottie was working late.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.240
That means Amanda was 
 home alone with Nanny.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.160
She should have stayed 
 with the ghost.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.080
- Now she's alone with a lunatic. 
 - Nanny isn't a lunatic.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.640
Beth just told Amanda 
 that to scare her.

Amanda told her everything 
 that had happened.

- What are those for? 
 - I'm very disappointed in you girls.

 going to go over there

I will not. I have

 over there last night,

you can go over there now.

I'm not, and I don't want to be 
 in your lame old group anymore.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.680
Good. I wasn't going to 
 let you in anyway.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.480
And you're a snitch, too. 
 You're a chicken and a snitch!

16:04.480 --> 16:06.400
I couldn't stand being you.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.080
Oh, give me a break. 
 It's not even dark.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.040
You can't be scared now.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.320
One thing's for sure-- 
 I'm never inviting you

16:19.320 --> 16:21.680
to do anything with us ever again.

16:23.000 --> 16:23.720
Hello.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.320
Wow. 
 No wonder Mom was so mad.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.280
You did this just to get me 
 in trouble, didn't you?

16:35.280 --> 16:38.640
I didn't do it. 
 It wasn't like this last night.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.160
Yeah, right. If you think

16:40.160 --> 16:43.280
that I'm going to clean up 
 a mess that you made--

16:43.280 --> 16:45.160
Now what?

16:52.240 --> 16:54.680
Beth, come on, let's go.

16:55.680 --> 17:00.720
Wow. 
 Look at all the dolls and stuffed animals.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.320
What an awesome collection.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.280
It's even bigger than mine.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.319
Beth, no!

17:16.240 --> 17:18.040
Aah!

17:18.040 --> 17:20.079
Aah! Oh, my--

17:20.079 --> 17:21.560
Open the door!

17:21.560 --> 17:23.440
Open up! Help!

17:23.440 --> 17:25.160
Someone let me out!

17:25.160 --> 17:28.560
No! Leave me alone! 
 Open up!

17:28.560 --> 17:32.000
Help! 
 Leave me alone!

17:32.000 --> 17:35.840
Please! 
 [SOBBING]

17:35.840 --> 17:37.680
Leave me alone.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.920
[SOBBING]

17:48.120 --> 17:50.480
Who are you?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.960
It's-- it's Nanny.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.560
Your-- your mother?

18:02.560 --> 18:05.320
Nanny's your mother?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.520
"Help me"? Help you?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.320
I... I...

18:20.320 --> 18:22.400
I can help you, yes.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.840
Please open the door, 
 and I can help you.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.280
I'll get her. I will.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.560
Please open--

18:31.400 --> 18:34.360
Thank you. I'll get her.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.040
No, don't go, Amanda! 
 You have to help me.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.880
I'm stuck in the mirror! 
 Amanda, can't you see me?

18:41.880 --> 18:44.040
How am I going to 
 get out of here?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.240
Nanny?

18:53.360 --> 18:56.000
Nanny, where are you?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.840
Nanny!

19:00.840 --> 19:02.920
[CAR DOOR CLOSE]

19:02.920 --> 19:04.800
Nanny! 
 Oh, no. What--

19:08.000 --> 19:11.720
No, Nanny, no. 
 Don't leave!

19:16.680 --> 19:18.160
Nanny, wait!

19:18.160 --> 19:19.520
Please don't go.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.280
You have to come with me.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.600
Where? 
 What are you saying?

19:23.600 --> 19:25.280
Over there. Come on!

19:25.280 --> 19:27.200
Oh, no. 
 I'm not going in there.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.640
Too many bad memories.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.920
You girls can go and 
 play your jokes on someone else.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.440
No, it's not a joke. 
 Please.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.360
No, I'm leaving. 
 I'm not wanted here anymore.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.280
Yes, you are. Look!

19:48.040 --> 19:50.440
Where did you get this?

19:54.800 --> 19:58.320
No. No, no, I can't.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.160
You can. You have to.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.000
No, it's too hard. I can't.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.560
I can't.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.120
- You can. 
 - No.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.440
Yes, it's OK.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.440
Huh!

20:14.240 --> 20:15.200
My baby!

20:19.600 --> 20:21.520
My poor baby!

20:22.480 --> 20:25.600
I didn't know you were here.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.280
All this time...

20:28.800 --> 20:29.550
Oh!

20:31.040 --> 20:35.680
Oh, nothing bad will 
 ever happen to you again.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.600
Yes. Yes, I'll go with you.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.800
Oh...

21:13.800 --> 21:15.720
Amanda!

21:24.920 --> 21:27.160
Amanda, help me!

21:27.160 --> 21:28.440
Beth?

21:28.440 --> 21:30.680
Amanda, help me. 
 I'm stuck in the mirror.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.440
Amanda?

21:33.640 --> 21:34.520
Where's Beth?

21:34.520 --> 21:36.640
Her mom said you guys 
 were both over here.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.600
Please, Amanda, help me!

21:38.600 --> 21:41.200
Are you going to stop 
 bossing me around?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.920
Yes.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.680
Are you going to stop 
 bossing your friends around?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.200
Yes.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.320
Well, OK. 
 I'll let you out.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.000
You know, Beth, 
 I think we're going to have

21:55.000 --> 21:57.480
to make some changes 
 in this group.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.880
The End.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.720
So what happened 
 with Amanda and Beth?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.600
Amanda had a great summer.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.680
She even let Beth 
 hang with the group.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.440
Good story, Dave.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.320
Excellent. 
 Really cool.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.360
I declare this meeting 
 of the Midnight Society closed.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.360
Next week, everybody.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.640
See you guys later.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.680
Come on, Zeeb.

22:32.680 --> 22:36.040
I'll buy you a soda 
 to cool you off.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.840
Ow, ow, ow!

22:41.160 --> 22:43.280
- Kristen? 
 - Yeah?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.440
Aren't you going to--

22:45.440 --> 22:47.920
The present! 
 Oh, I'm sorry, Dave.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.120
Your story was so good.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.840
That's OK.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.040
A locket like in your story.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.960
You like it?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.760
I love it. It's beautiful,

23:08.760 --> 23:11.280
but you shouldn't have gotten this.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.720
What do you think?

23:12.720 --> 23:15.560
Perfect. 
 I knew it would be.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.360
I'll think of you 
 every time I wear it...

23:18.360 --> 23:20.000
forever.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.800
Let's catch up.
