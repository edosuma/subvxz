Granfer?

01:49.460 --> 01:51.835
- Yeah?
- Can I come out on the boat with you?

01:52.460 --> 01:55.626
You got school today, my love.
Lessons to learn.

01:55.710 --> 01:58.126
They can't teach me
how to bait a lobster pot.

01:58.210 --> 02:01.876
I think your mother might use me as bait
if I let you play hooky.

02:02.460 --> 02:04.335
Now, here.

02:04.418 --> 02:06.418
I'll take you out on Saturday. All right?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.085
Go on.

02:13.626 --> 02:16.210
<i>What the bloody hell's
going on down here, Jago?</i>

02:17.001 --> 02:20.126
I can't find her.

02:21.710 --> 02:24.460
A grown man... wandering around...

02:25.376 --> 02:28.501
with a pixie in his pocket
needs his head examining.

02:28.585 --> 02:31.793
Hey, you won't say that when
I'm dragged down to Davy Jones' locker.

02:31.876 --> 02:34.210
Well, at least
I'll get a decent night's sleep. Here!

02:38.376 --> 02:41.793
Have a good day, my darlin' maid.

02:42.626 --> 02:44.418
'Tis still the middle
of the bleedin' night.

02:44.501 --> 02:46.585
- Ahh.
- Oh, no!

02:54.460 --> 02:56.300
Here, let me give you a hand with that,
Father.

02:56.626 --> 02:57.626
All set, Jim.

02:57.710 --> 02:58.835
Good lad.

03:00.251 --> 03:03.918
Here he is, just like clockwork.
Turns up when all the work's done.

03:04.668 --> 03:07.668
- What time do you call this then?
- Ungodly!

03:12.460 --> 03:14.500
<i>Here. Dad and I
found another song last night.</i>

03:14.543 --> 03:15.543
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:15.626 --> 03:17.710
- What's that, then?
- "Nelson's Blood."

03:17.793 --> 03:20.751
- Love song, is it?
- Oh, no. Not quite.

03:21.251 --> 03:24.418
So, apparently,
at the Battle of Trafalgar,

03:25.085 --> 03:29.626
they had to put Lord Nelson's corpse
in a big, bloody barrel of brandy.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.126
What did they use? Martell or Courvoisier?

03:32.210 --> 03:35.001
A big word for this time of day, innit?

03:35.085 --> 03:36.418
Well, how's the song go, then?

03:37.001 --> 03:40.710
<i>♪ And a drop of Nelson's blood

03:40.793 --> 03:44.543

04:42.918 --> 04:44.358
What's going on?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.769
It's going straight to voice mail.

04:45.793 --> 04:48.460
- Let's just leave without him.
- Totally. You snooze, you lose.

04:48.543 --> 04:50.644
There is no way he's getting out
of your stag do that easy.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.293
Yeah.

04:56.376 --> 04:57.585
<i>I'm on my way, Troy.</i>

05:00.793 --> 05:03.918
See, what I don't get,
is why a smart-arse lawyer

05:04.001 --> 05:05.460
wouldn't insist on a prenup.

05:05.543 --> 05:07.085
It's called trust, Danny.

05:07.168 --> 05:09.418
Is that why Abigail
didn't trust you to go to Vegas?

05:09.501 --> 05:11.960
She did. She just didn't trust you guys
to take care of me.

05:13.335 --> 05:15.793
No, sailing a yacht
out into the wide blue yonder.

05:15.876 --> 05:17.085
That's much more of a buzz.

05:17.168 --> 05:18.328
If you ever hear me say that,

05:18.376 --> 05:21.418
fly me to Switzerland and check me
into the euthanasia clinic, pronto.

05:21.501 --> 05:23.293
With pleasure, mate.

05:23.376 --> 05:26.096
You're just cynical because
you've not met the right girl yet, Danny.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.543
No. It's because monogamy...
It isn't natural.

05:29.626 --> 05:31.543
That is... That is right. That is right.

05:31.626 --> 05:33.668
In mammals,
it is practically non-existent.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.501
What about penguins?

05:36.585 --> 05:38.936
They mate for life. I saw it
on a documentary on <i>Animal Planet.</i>

05:38.960 --> 05:42.418
Penguins live on the South Pole, Henry,
where it's a hundred below zero.

05:42.501 --> 05:45.501
No way they're gonna get their
crown jewels out for a bit on the side.

05:46.085 --> 05:48.876
For them, monogamy is all about
keeping their bollocks warm.

05:50.293 --> 05:52.126

06:03.876 --> 06:05.335
- Got everything?
- Yup.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.293
- Two times two.
- Four.

06:19.376 --> 06:21.335
- Three times three.
- Nine.

06:21.418 --> 06:25.626
<i>When possible, make
a U-turn. When possible, make a U-turn.</i>

06:25.710 --> 06:27.335
Stop repeating yourself, woman!

06:27.418 --> 06:30.352
Henry, you better get used to it.
That's what marriage sounds like.

06:30.376 --> 06:32.710
- Four times four?
- Sixteen.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.876
- Five times five?
- Mmm.

06:36.043 --> 06:39.085
Hey.

06:39.168 --> 06:41.728
- You have to reverse.
- You gonna have to back up, mate.

06:41.793 --> 06:44.876
- Any damage is coming out of your bonus.
- No pressure, mate.

06:46.085 --> 06:48.543
One of you's gonna have to get out
and help me. Please?

06:49.460 --> 06:50.876
I'll deal with it.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.543
Sorry, love.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.210
Um, would you mind backing up?

07:03.293 --> 07:07.335
Only it's a bit tight down this end,
and my friend's only just passed his test.

07:07.418 --> 07:10.418
Yeah, I'm amazed he got a licence
considering he's visually impaired.

07:10.501 --> 07:12.376
- It's a one-way street.
- What?

07:14.126 --> 07:18.835
Sorry about that.
We're from out of town.

07:18.918 --> 07:21.960
Yeah, you don't say. Only an idiot
would bring that thing down here.

07:22.043 --> 07:24.352
Oh, nothing to do with the bright spark
who designed a road system

07:24.376 --> 07:25.602
that's too narrow to drive down.

07:25.626 --> 07:28.126
Yeah, how short-sighted
of the 17th century town planner

07:28.210 --> 07:30.835
not to account for that cock extension.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.626
You're gonna have to back up.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.876
What a tosser.

07:41.793 --> 07:43.543
What's a... tosser?

07:44.626 --> 07:45.960
Well...

07:46.043 --> 07:48.251
<i>So let's have a toast, ay?</i>

07:48.335 --> 07:50.710
<i>To-To the newest resident of Port Isaac.</i>

07:51.626 --> 07:54.168
- To Kenwyn.
- To Kenwyn.

07:54.251 --> 07:58.501
May he bring as much joy, laughter
and wisdom to our world as...

07:58.585 --> 07:59.626
as his granfer did.

08:00.751 --> 08:01.751
Thanks, Jim.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.835
I'll be there in a minute.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.376
Who's Sir Walter Raleigh?

08:07.460 --> 08:09.751
Some wanker from London.

08:09.835 --> 08:11.811
Apparently, they're staying up
at Charles Montegue's place.

08:11.835 --> 08:14.293
Huh? Damn bloody emmets.

08:14.876 --> 08:17.835
Coming down here like they own the place
with their second homes,

08:17.918 --> 08:20.876
and... only visit twice a bloody year.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.960
Gives us two chances to take their money,
son.

08:24.043 --> 08:25.311
If it were down to me,

08:25.335 --> 08:29.126
we'd have toll booths on every road
crossing the River Tamar.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.418
That's what they do in Wales.

08:30.501 --> 08:32.710
Charge the buggers
for the privilege of coming in.

08:32.793 --> 08:36.835
Hey, you get any more militant, my son,

08:36.918 --> 08:39.460
you'll have to join
the Cornish National Liberation Army.

08:39.543 --> 08:41.085
- I never left, Father.
- Good boy.

08:43.376 --> 08:45.460
- Hello, gentlemen.
- How are you?

08:45.543 --> 08:47.918
- Four pints of lager, please.
- Lager?

08:48.001 --> 08:51.460
I'm afraid we don't have much call
for fizzy drinks this time of year.

08:51.543 --> 08:56.126
We've got Tribute, Proper Job
and guest ale, Bishop's Finger.

08:56.210 --> 08:57.585
Do we know where it's been?

08:57.668 --> 09:00.543
That was good, man. That was good.

09:01.251 --> 09:05.210
No. But I got a pretty good idea
where he could stick it.

09:16.585 --> 09:19.585
Oh, here he is. Captain Pugwash.

09:19.668 --> 09:21.251
- Don't shout.
- Morning, chaps.

09:21.835 --> 09:23.626
Slight change of plan, I'm afraid.

09:23.710 --> 09:26.168
We won't be casting off
or trimming the jib today.

09:26.251 --> 09:27.519
Is that a euphemism?

09:27.543 --> 09:30.210
No, the boat's stuck in Milford Haven
with a ripped sail.

09:30.751 --> 09:33.085
- Where's Milford Haven?
- Wales.

09:33.168 --> 09:35.210
- How we gettin' there?
- We're not, Driss.

09:35.293 --> 09:38.460
You're telling me I gave up a seat
at the roulette table in the Bellagio

09:38.543 --> 09:39.626
for a weekend yachting,

09:39.710 --> 09:40.960
and we don't have a yacht?

09:41.418 --> 09:42.418
Correct.

09:42.501 --> 09:44.293
Well, what are we gonna do instead?

09:48.168 --> 09:50.710
Whoa!

09:50.793 --> 09:54.585
It's last man standing!

09:56.835 --> 09:58.543
Hey, guys. I'm getting the hang of this.

09:58.626 --> 10:00.585
Oh, oh, New York, here I come!

10:01.585 --> 10:04.210
- No sign of those numpties?
- No.

10:04.293 --> 10:06.668
- When were they due back?
- About two hours ago.

10:10.793 --> 10:13.113
- We've gotta get those boards.
- I am staying on dry land.

10:13.168 --> 10:15.210
Another 20 minutes,
and there won't be any!

10:15.293 --> 10:17.251
Hey, hey. You can get that one.
Get that one.

10:17.335 --> 10:18.710
I'm not sure. I'll try.

10:18.793 --> 10:20.769
Henry, no.
He's gonna fall and crack his head open.

10:20.793 --> 10:22.602
- Danny, he could get that one.
- I'm gonna fall...

10:22.626 --> 10:25.168
- No, he can get it.
- Help!

10:26.210 --> 10:30.085
Jago, I need you to come
and help me get these sheets off the line.

10:30.168 --> 10:32.876
He's a fisherman, Maggie,
not a bloody chambermaid.

10:34.793 --> 10:37.585
This has to be
the worst stag do of all time.

10:40.501 --> 10:42.460
Christ, we've got a shout!

10:42.543 --> 10:43.668
Where's me pager, Maggie?

10:43.751 --> 10:48.501
Don't ask me. I'm a barmaid,
not a Lifeboat Operations Manager.

10:49.168 --> 10:52.001
- What we got?
- Three men in the water off Tag's Pit!

10:52.085 --> 10:53.085
Dig! Dig!

10:58.876 --> 11:01.501
- Over here!
- Boat! Help!

11:03.918 --> 11:06.751
All right now. Stay calm. Wait.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.710
- One at a time!
- Move. Move.

11:09.793 --> 11:12.376
- One at a time!
- Careful. Get up. Get up.

11:13.210 --> 11:15.418
All right. You. Get on.

11:15.501 --> 11:17.701
Oh, thank you so much.
I thought we were goners.

11:33.585 --> 11:35.626
Here, ladies. You forgot your handbag.

11:36.335 --> 11:38.960
Oof. Oh.

11:39.501 --> 11:41.585
We're on a stag do.

11:41.668 --> 11:44.019
You're never gonna get to the wedding
if you carry on like that.

11:44.043 --> 11:46.763
- Take it easy, Jim.
- Well, they're hangin'. All of 'em.

11:47.335 --> 11:49.335
Probably been on the wacky backy too.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.519
- Wacky backy?
- Jim, come on.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.293
Well, why else would they drag us out
on a day like this?

11:53.376 --> 11:55.918
Hey, relax, chief.
We come in peace, man. Okay?

11:56.001 --> 11:57.126
Chief?

11:57.626 --> 12:00.543
Hey, listen. We're just not
used to the ocean, all right?

12:00.626 --> 12:03.001
You'd do well to show her
a bit of respect.

12:03.085 --> 12:04.126
- Oh, shit!
- What?

12:04.210 --> 12:05.460
Driss!

12:08.168 --> 12:09.918
Help!

12:12.543 --> 12:14.376
Help!

12:15.043 --> 12:17.376
Help.

12:18.460 --> 12:21.126
<i>Port Isaac, this is Whisky Bravo 178.</i>

12:21.210 --> 12:24.126
<i>We've a fix one kilometre south-west
of Tag's Pit.</i>

12:24.210 --> 12:28.251
<i>Getting quite badly burned, so...
take your time. Over.</i>

12:29.626 --> 12:31.793
<i>One, two, testing. One, two.</i>

12:33.668 --> 12:37.251
One, two, one, two, one, two.

12:37.335 --> 12:41.626
I thought we was having a sing-song,
not putting on a bloody rock concert.

12:41.710 --> 12:44.293
You're not here to hide, Jago.
You're here to be heard.

12:44.376 --> 12:45.710
<i>Thank you, Yoko Ono.</i>

12:45.793 --> 12:48.960
- I shall be listening.
- I know you will.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.418
See you, Sal.

12:53.001 --> 12:55.210
Can't keep ignoring the bank, Rowan.

12:59.376 --> 13:01.626
You need to call them.

13:03.001 --> 13:04.918
I'm not sure what to say.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.835
This came from the Inland Revenue.

13:19.126 --> 13:22.251
I am not the pheasant plucker.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.793
I'm the pheasant plucker's mate.

13:25.085 --> 13:30.210
And I'm only plucking pheasants
'cause the pheasant plucker's late.

13:30.293 --> 13:32.418
I'm only fucking pheas...

13:32.501 --> 13:34.960
No, I... I can't get my tongue round it!

13:35.043 --> 13:37.710
Well, that's not what Rowan's
been telling everyone.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.543
Get off me, you great arse!

13:41.626 --> 13:44.751
Here, do you two want to get a room
or shall we get on with it, eh?

13:44.835 --> 13:46.710
Ooh!

13:50.710 --> 13:53.543
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're the Fisherman's Friends.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.585
We all hail from Port Isaac,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.918
and the songs we're singing today
are about sailors and the sea.

13:59.001 --> 14:02.251
These songs come from a time
when sailors were clapped in irons,

14:02.335 --> 14:05.210
hung from the highest yardarm,
nailed to the mast,

14:05.293 --> 14:06.293
shanghaied, wanghaied...

14:06.376 --> 14:08.227
- Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
- What? Here?

14:08.251 --> 14:09.769
- Yeah, here. Right here. Pull in.
- Why?

14:09.793 --> 14:12.085
...rum, bum, buggered, blinded...

14:15.043 --> 14:16.626
And that was all before they set sail.

14:18.293 --> 14:20.835
Jim over there,
he's been sufferin' from a sore throat.

14:20.918 --> 14:24.543
Sounds nasty. Have you consulted
your health care professional about it?

14:24.626 --> 14:25.918
Yes, I have, son.

14:26.001 --> 14:29.710
Well, if the antibiotics don't work, you
can always suck on a Fisherman's Friend.

14:29.793 --> 14:32.210
Oh.

14:32.293 --> 14:37.043
This next song is John Kanaka,
a right rascal if ever there was one.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.460

14:55.376 --> 14:56.543
Yeah.

14:56.626 --> 14:58.352
- Oh, this is bloody torture.
- No, no, no, no.

14:58.376 --> 15:01.001
I want these guys signed up
to Duke Management's roster.

15:01.085 --> 15:03.205
Yeah, why don't you sign 'em up for life?

15:03.251 --> 15:04.335
I'm serious, man.

15:04.751 --> 15:07.710

They're funny. They look the part.
They're singing copyright-free songs.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.335
- What is not to like?
- Everything.

15:17.418 --> 15:18.960
Oh, don't be so cynical.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.835
These songs
are reminiscent of the work songs

15:21.918 --> 15:23.960
sung on the plantations by my people.

15:24.043 --> 15:26.501
I'm not sure these are slave songs, Troy.

15:28.835 --> 15:31.626
Well, okay,
but fishermen are slaves to the sea,

15:31.710 --> 15:33.501
and exploited peoples across the globe

15:33.585 --> 15:35.918
have always shared their suffering
through song.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.668
<i>- ♪ John Kanaka-naka tu-rie-ay ♪</i>
- Still feels like a long-shot, Troy.

15:39.751 --> 15:42.710
No, no. Trust me.
My dad is gonna dig this historical shit.

15:42.793 --> 15:43.918
The label will dig it.

15:44.001 --> 15:47.043
Why don't you go do what you do best?
Sign 'em up.

15:47.126 --> 15:49.166
No, no, no, no. Don't send me up there.
I'm hangin'.

15:49.210 --> 15:52.335
Well, go hang with them. Get.

Of course not.

Once removed.

16:46.376 --> 16:47.418
Nice one!

16:52.710 --> 16:55.585
I'll be with you in a minute.

16:57.168 --> 16:58.293
Small world.

16:59.168 --> 17:02.626
Um, just out of interest,
what kind of music were they singing?

17:02.710 --> 17:04.710
The rock 'n' roll of 1752.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.167
- That'll be 38 pound, fifty.
- Ta, my lover.

17:10.167 --> 17:12.460
- I'll get these.
- Oh, thank you.

17:12.542 --> 17:15.710
Well, you saved our lives yesterday.
It's the least I could do.

17:18.626 --> 17:21.710
I'd like to talk to you and the boys
about the future of the group.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.917
- Future?
- Yeah.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.710
I manage bands,
and I'm interested in representing you.

17:27.792 --> 17:30.126
You'd better come and talk to the boys.

17:31.918 --> 17:36.751
For your information,
my Jago is the Roger Daltry of the group.

17:37.376 --> 17:39.043
Well, I'll bear that in mind.

17:41.376 --> 17:43.543
Here, you'll never guess what.

17:44.376 --> 17:47.668
- Our boys have just been talent-spotted.
- By who?

17:47.751 --> 17:49.085
Your admirer.

17:49.751 --> 17:52.876
Apparently, he's some kind of big shot
in the music industry.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.835
Watching you sing was one of those...
rare moments in the music business

17:57.918 --> 18:01.793
when you realise you are
witnessing something truly original.

18:01.876 --> 18:04.835
The bottom line is...
you've got a unique sound.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.876
And we believe we can help you
get it released by a major label.

18:19.918 --> 18:21.960
You can't be...

18:22.043 --> 18:24.418
Now, all right, all right.
Now look, look, look.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.126
I'm serious.

18:28.251 --> 18:31.126
So how's about we crack open the champagne
and get this deal done?

18:31.210 --> 18:32.501
Right here. Right now.

18:32.585 --> 18:34.668
Hang on. You mean this is for real?

18:35.293 --> 18:39.001
Thanks for the offer, son,
but we're just fishermen, see.

18:39.085 --> 18:42.626
We have no need to sell our souls
for 15 minutes of fame.

18:43.585 --> 18:45.001
Especially to an emmet.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.501
An emmet?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.501
It's old Cornish for an ant.

18:50.293 --> 18:53.001
Something that invades in large numbers,

18:53.918 --> 18:57.793
causes great irritation
and is a helluva job to get rid of.

18:57.876 --> 18:59.710
Now, if you don't mind...

19:01.751 --> 19:04.168
some of us have got some real work to do.

19:10.793 --> 19:12.126
Thanks for your time.

19:16.585 --> 19:17.626
Where's the...?

19:26.543 --> 19:29.293
Oh. Come on.

19:31.626 --> 19:32.876
Fuck it. Just one bar.

19:32.960 --> 19:36.001
The only place you'll get reception
down here is on the sea wall.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.043
Way out there?

19:44.210 --> 19:45.293
- Is that Danny?
- Mmm.

19:45.376 --> 19:47.835
Is that... Wait. All right. All right.
All right, get it.

19:47.918 --> 19:50.293
Hey, Danny, what's going on, man?

19:50.376 --> 19:52.376
Where the bloody hell
have you parked the car?

19:52.460 --> 19:54.710
- Ah, sorry, bro. We had to peel out.
<i>- Eh?</i>

19:54.793 --> 19:58.335
- Major, major crisis.
- Well, what about <i>this</i> major crisis?

19:58.418 --> 20:01.293
Look,
you never leave a man behind enemy lines.

20:01.376 --> 20:02.543
<i>First rule of war!</i>

20:02.626 --> 20:04.644
First rule of rock 'n' roll,
don't forget the money.

20:04.668 --> 20:07.251
As soon as they've signed,
we'll get you out of there.

20:07.335 --> 20:10.501
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but they ain't signing anything, mate.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.418
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Oh, oh, Danny.

20:13.501 --> 20:14.543
<i>Hello?</i>

20:14.626 --> 20:16.710
I'm... I'm sorry.
Have-Have you lost your touch?

20:16.793 --> 20:19.668
No. These guys aren't interested
in fame and fortune.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.668
Hey, hey. Everybody's interested
in fame and fortune.

20:22.751 --> 20:25.085
So do your job and close the deal.

20:25.835 --> 20:29.293
I don't want to wake up and find out
somebody else has beat us to it.

20:32.668 --> 20:36.168
Hello. Hello? Shit.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.501
Ooh.

20:42.126 --> 20:44.251
Hold up! Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.418
What's it gonna take
to get you boys over the line, eh?

20:49.710 --> 20:53.043
Sorry, Danny. It isn't going to happen.

20:53.918 --> 20:56.501
For me, Leadville and Rowan
'tis a dream come true, but...

20:57.460 --> 20:59.210
but me boy and a few others ain't so keen.

20:59.293 --> 21:02.293
We don't need the others, Jago.
Five is more than enough.

21:02.376 --> 21:05.501
In fact, five is the magic number
when it comes to any boy band.

21:05.585 --> 21:08.335
You know, look at, er, the Jackson Five,
Take That.

21:09.251 --> 21:12.293
Now, we got to stick together down here,
one an' all.

21:13.335 --> 21:17.001
That's the difference between
sinking or swimming in a place like this.

21:17.085 --> 21:20.876
Yup, the only way this'll work
is if you manage to convince Jim.

21:21.668 --> 21:23.876
Well, how do I do that?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.918
There's an old Corny saying.

21:27.001 --> 21:31.585
You never know a man till you find out
what his legs is made of at sea.

21:44.251 --> 21:45.918
Where's the lift?

21:59.626 --> 22:02.418
I thought I'd made my position
perfectly clear.

22:02.876 --> 22:05.668
You did,
but us ants are tricky to get rid of.

22:05.751 --> 22:06.793
Hello, darling'.

22:07.335 --> 22:09.376
Jago said there may be room at the inn.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.543
Yeah, you...
You'd have to ask my daughter about that.

22:12.626 --> 22:14.501
She runs the B & B side of things.

22:15.210 --> 22:18.001
Tam, could you go and fetch your mother,
please. Thanks, darling.

22:18.085 --> 22:19.751
Mam! The tosser's at the door!

22:22.626 --> 22:23.668
Yeah?

22:27.626 --> 22:28.626
Tosser.

22:36.501 --> 22:37.543
Hello again.

22:38.668 --> 22:40.043
I'm looking for a room.

22:41.210 --> 22:42.501
I'm sorry. We're full.

22:43.251 --> 22:45.835
Well, that's...
not what it says on the sign.

22:48.168 --> 22:51.293
Look. It's just for one night,
and I've got an early start.

23:08.751 --> 23:10.477
<i>Severe gale nine...</i>

23:10.501 --> 23:12.168
<i>to violent storm eleven.</i>

23:12.251 --> 23:14.168
<i>Rain then squally showers.</i>

23:14.251 --> 23:17.126
<i>Poor becoming moderate. Jersey...</i>

23:17.751 --> 23:20.626
Mr Anderson.

23:21.210 --> 23:23.543
You're waking up the other guests.

23:27.293 --> 23:28.751
Mr Anderson.

23:37.168 --> 23:38.460
Mr Anderson!

23:40.751 --> 23:42.376
Oh! Oh!

23:44.418 --> 23:45.418
Your wake-up call.

23:46.085 --> 23:48.418
Oh, er... What is it?

23:55.293 --> 23:56.335
I'm coming!

24:01.960 --> 24:05.085
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pull up the anchor. I'm here.

24:05.543 --> 24:08.501
Sorry I'm late.

24:09.168 --> 24:10.835
What have you come as, then?

24:10.918 --> 24:13.751
We're going fishing, son,
not competing in The America's Cup.

24:16.085 --> 24:18.293
You're gonna have to
change that jumper, boy.

24:18.376 --> 24:20.210
Fishermen don't wear green.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.626
Makes the boat seek land.

24:25.418 --> 24:27.418
And don't whistle on board.

24:28.585 --> 24:30.793
To whistle
is to challenge the wind herself.

24:31.710 --> 24:33.835
She might whip up a proper storm.

24:34.793 --> 24:36.585
- Anything else?
- Yeah,

24:36.668 --> 24:38.793
turn starboard after leaving the dock.

24:38.876 --> 24:41.168
Always kiss the first fish you catch.

24:41.668 --> 24:46.043
Never, ever, under any circumstance,
say the word "rabbit"!

24:47.501 --> 24:48.918
- Rabbit?
- Shh!

24:50.918 --> 24:55.210

25:11.460 --> 25:14.835
- Do you want an orange?
- Will it stop me feeling sick?

25:14.918 --> 25:17.585
No, just makes it smell sweeter
when it comes up.

25:21.335 --> 25:23.126
Oh, oh.

25:23.210 --> 25:26.460
Here, answer me this, then.

25:26.543 --> 25:27.918
What I don't understand...

25:28.501 --> 25:31.835
is why anyone would wanna part
with their hard-earned cash

25:32.543 --> 25:35.668
to buy a record sung
by ten hairy-ass fishermen.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.335
Because deep down,
there's a sailor in all of us.

25:38.418 --> 25:41.835
There's never been a sailor in me!

25:43.001 --> 25:44.210
Your songs...

25:45.418 --> 25:47.668
transport the listener
to distant shores...

25:48.168 --> 25:51.418
and allows them to return stronger
and braver than they've ever felt before.

25:51.501 --> 25:53.501
I never thought I'd say this to anyone,

25:53.835 --> 25:55.751
but I think you talk more bollocks
than my wife.

25:55.835 --> 25:57.293
God rest her soul.

25:57.918 --> 26:00.751
Look, what I'm proposing
is that you come up to London,

26:00.835 --> 26:03.585
record a demo
so the labels have got something to hear.

26:04.043 --> 26:07.210
We can't go on a jolly like that,
we got lobster to catch.

26:07.293 --> 26:09.585
Well, okay.
Then, we'll record it down here.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.460
Duke Management will cover
all your expenses.

26:11.543 --> 26:13.001
Is there any money in it for us?

26:13.085 --> 26:15.418
Well, if we're lucky enough
to land a deal, yeah.

26:15.835 --> 26:19.876
Not a fortune, mind you, but, you know,
definitely enough to go on a nice holiday.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.293
Maggie Googled him.

26:23.085 --> 26:24.626
He is who he says he is.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.418
Sally reckons he's a proper big shot.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.876
Proper big mouth, more like.

26:29.335 --> 26:32.960
Come on, Dad. You always told me,
"Never trust an emmet,"

26:33.043 --> 26:36.168
and I've never met one yet
who could prove you wrong.

26:37.085 --> 26:41.335
Listen, son.
One thing I've learned in my old age.

26:41.876 --> 26:44.418
It ain't so much black and white
as them an' us.

26:45.335 --> 26:47.751
We have to take every man
on his own merit.

26:48.085 --> 26:50.501
Yeah. We might even make money out of it.

26:51.085 --> 26:54.751
Come on, Rowan.
It's a bloody pipe dream, and you know it.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.710
Right now, I'll give anything a shot.

27:05.501 --> 27:09.710
Ooh. No charge for the wake-up call then?

27:10.501 --> 27:12.085
All part of the service.

27:12.793 --> 27:15.085
I'll make sure I mention it
in my Trip Advisor review.

27:19.418 --> 27:21.293
Mr Anderson, I'm glad I caught you.

27:22.168 --> 27:24.460
- Can we have a word?
- Yeah.

27:25.001 --> 27:26.001
Come on in. Sit down.

27:27.001 --> 27:28.001
Here.

27:28.835 --> 27:30.210
Ah, now.

27:35.376 --> 27:36.376
Now...

27:37.585 --> 27:39.835
just for clarity's sake...

27:41.251 --> 27:43.710
if we did agree to let you manage us...

27:44.835 --> 27:48.085
you'd have to understand
that our real work comes first.

27:48.168 --> 27:51.043
Now we, we got boats,
businesses to run and...

27:51.918 --> 27:54.876
and they'd have to...
be looked after before anything else.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.043
Absolutely.

27:58.168 --> 28:02.210
And you'd have to promise
you wouldn't take the piss.

28:03.710 --> 28:05.210
Now, we've got our ways down here.

28:06.293 --> 28:11.293
And once you cross the River Tamar,
you're not in England any more.

28:12.376 --> 28:13.626
We're a land apart.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.918
Now you-you get my drift, son?

28:18.460 --> 28:19.876
I give you my word.

28:21.293 --> 28:22.293
Good.

28:24.126 --> 28:25.335
'Cause down here...

28:27.001 --> 28:30.960
a man's word is... strong as Cornish oak.

28:42.293 --> 28:44.835
- Danny's on line three.
- All right, put him through.

28:47.668 --> 28:50.418
If it isn't the Pirate of Penzance!

28:50.501 --> 28:54.210
Yeah. I forgot
what a gifted comedian you are, Troy.

28:54.293 --> 28:57.085
Danny, have you plundered the village
and found any hidden treasures?

28:57.168 --> 28:58.418
<i>I did indeed, Henry.</i>

28:58.501 --> 29:01.876
Not only have I persuaded all
ten fishermen to sign on the dotted line,

29:01.960 --> 29:04.126
they're also up for recording a demo.

29:04.210 --> 29:07.751
<i>Oh, my God. Oh!</i>

29:07.835 --> 29:10.668
I cannot believe you fell for that!
You knobber!

29:10.751 --> 29:11.751
What?

29:12.876 --> 29:14.918
Danny, it was a joke, bro!

29:15.001 --> 29:18.668
Do you really think we would sign
a boy band with a combined age of 653?

29:19.168 --> 29:20.585
You bastards.

29:21.501 --> 29:23.626
<i>Now, I suggest you tear up that contract</i>

29:24.085 --> 29:26.710
and get yourself back within the M25
where you belong.

29:28.210 --> 29:30.710
- I can't.
- Why?

29:33.043 --> 29:34.418
I've given them my word.

29:34.918 --> 29:37.668
When did that ever count for anything?

30:00.835 --> 30:01.835
Hi, there.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.376
I'm impressed.

30:05.793 --> 30:06.793
You are?

30:07.501 --> 30:09.581
Can't believe you got 'em
to give up a day's fishing.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.376
Yeah.

30:12.460 --> 30:15.085
I just hope you make all this bother
worth their while.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.043
Well, that's the plan.

30:17.585 --> 30:20.501
I mean, after all,
I gave your dad my word.

- We can't record here.
- I got a plan.

31:48.626 --> 31:52.626
Lord Almighty. We're scuppered now.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.001
Sorry? Scuppered?

31:54.376 --> 31:55.668
It's a sign.

31:56.126 --> 31:58.293
Like the albatross in the <i>Ancient Mariner.</i>

31:58.376 --> 32:00.626
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, you know?

32:00.710 --> 32:04.626
- No.
- Kills the albatross is becalmed.

32:05.085 --> 32:06.460
Becalmed?

32:06.543 --> 32:07.876
Dead in the water, mate.

32:08.585 --> 32:12.168
Water, water everywhere,
but not a bloody drop to drink.

32:13.001 --> 32:15.293
Yeah, but it's a... It's a seagull.
It's not an albatross.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.668
It's the same difference, Danny.

32:18.668 --> 32:21.501
Yeah. A curse is a curse.

32:26.168 --> 32:27.335
How's it going?

32:28.460 --> 32:31.960
Oh. Got some great guest vocals
from the seagulls.

32:32.793 --> 32:34.876
Why don't you try recording in the church?

32:35.626 --> 32:38.168
It's where they all learned to sing.
It's brilliant acoustics.

32:39.251 --> 32:41.793
I-I reckon it'll be easier
if we went into the studio.

32:42.501 --> 32:44.293
Then you risk losing their charm.

32:44.876 --> 32:48.668
The people that come and listen to them
don't care if they hit the high notes.

32:48.751 --> 32:50.793
They want to be transported
to the high seas.

No. You were right. The sound's great.

33:49.085 --> 33:52.293
Although I was picking up a little bit
of interference in the last verse.

33:52.376 --> 33:55.001
Might be me pacemaker.

33:55.085 --> 33:58.168
Now you don't want to be turning that off,
Father.

34:03.418 --> 34:06.251
Right. Take five, lads,
but, um, well done, everyone.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.210
Sounding... brilliant.

34:12.168 --> 34:14.668
Do me a favour and take care of it, Driss.

34:16.418 --> 34:19.960
Yeah, j-just tell Troy I'll be back
by the end of the week. Okay?

34:21.293 --> 34:22.612
Yeah, listen. I've got to bounce.

34:24.501 --> 34:27.168
- Off already?
- Got to pick Tamsyn up from school.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.710
Ah. Listen, thanks again for the tip-off.

34:30.793 --> 34:32.835
I mean, this place is a real discovery.

34:34.085 --> 34:36.793
Hardly. I've been coming here all my life.

34:36.876 --> 34:38.556
Six generations of my family buried there.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.751
Um, could I...
buy you a drink later to say thank you?

34:47.126 --> 34:49.126
Sorry, I already got plans.

34:50.335 --> 34:51.793
Anything exciting?

34:53.293 --> 34:55.876
Homework. Big pile of laundry.

34:57.168 --> 34:58.751
Well, maybe some other time then.

34:59.543 --> 35:00.835
Yeah, maybe.

35:04.043 --> 35:05.501
About that curse?

35:07.418 --> 35:09.501
They're winding you up, Danny.

35:29.751 --> 35:31.126
Okay, lads.

35:31.751 --> 35:34.293
Now, we've got nine shanties in the can,

35:34.376 --> 35:36.710
which means we're one track
short of an album.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.135
- Well, can I make a suggestion?
- Yeah.

35:39.793 --> 35:42.460
Something more melodic. "Widow Woman."

35:42.543 --> 35:43.602
Mm, aye.

35:43.626 --> 35:45.460
Oh, I'm... I'm not singing that.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.061
Come on, now, Rowan.
Don't be shy. Come on.

35:47.085 --> 35:48.977
- No.
- It's one of your best songs.

35:49.001 --> 35:50.161
- Come on, my lovely.
- Go on.

37:01.335 --> 37:02.585
What's it about?

37:03.668 --> 37:08.501
Back along... 1698. Down Port Quin.

37:09.335 --> 37:10.835
Herring fleet went out.

37:11.376 --> 37:14.251
They say the gale blowed up
in a couple of hours.

37:15.168 --> 37:16.168
All was lost.

37:17.835 --> 37:19.918
Two dozen widows was made that day.

37:23.293 --> 37:25.460
We still suffer tragedies
from time to time,

37:25.543 --> 37:27.626
but... nothing like that, mind.

37:28.460 --> 37:30.335
- Amen to that, eh?
- Amen.

has parked your chariot on the Platt?

Oh, bollocks!

37:38.168 --> 37:40.460
What we lack in traffic wardens down here,
Danny,

37:40.543 --> 37:43.751

38:15.710 --> 38:17.519
His phone keeps going to voice mail.
What's going on?

38:17.543 --> 38:20.210
Pillock's still in Cornwall,
trying to bang that bird.

38:21.126 --> 38:23.501
- What bird?
- The girl with the Noddy car.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.126

Hello.

38:54.293 --> 38:55.918
<i>You proved your point, Danny.</i>

38:56.001 --> 39:00.085
- Now it's time to get back to business.
- This is business, Troy.

39:00.168 --> 39:04.001
<i>Cut the bullshit, Danny. I know
you're down there just trying to get laid.</i>

39:04.085 --> 39:05.918
All right, hands up, I <i>was.</i>

39:06.376 --> 39:07.835
<i>But things have changed.</i>

39:07.918 --> 39:11.210
Listen, I was reading up on sea shanties,
and you're right.

39:11.293 --> 39:13.960
They do have universal appeal.
I mean, after all,

39:14.043 --> 39:17.001
maritime work songs
were the rock 'n' roll of 1752.

39:17.418 --> 39:19.168
Has all the ocean air gone to your head?

39:19.251 --> 39:22.626
All right, maybe. But I genuinely think
these guys have got something to say.

39:23.293 --> 39:24.413
<i>I'm recording one more song,</i>

39:24.460 --> 39:26.019

39:29.043 --> 39:30.543
<i>This has gone far enough, Danny.</i>

39:30.626 --> 39:32.376
<i>I want you back at your desk...</i>

39:32.460 --> 39:33.668
after Henry's wedding

39:33.751 --> 39:36.335
to deal with the acts
that actually make us commission!

39:37.835 --> 39:39.126
What's wrong?

39:41.168 --> 39:42.418
Danny's gone native.

39:47.543 --> 39:48.918
Come in.

39:51.085 --> 39:52.376
Hiya.

39:53.710 --> 39:55.110
Helping your mum with her homework?

39:55.168 --> 39:58.293
We're doing kings and queens of England.

39:58.376 --> 40:00.085
My favourite is King Canute.

40:00.168 --> 40:01.519
That's the one who stopped the tide,

40:01.543 --> 40:03.543
and then the tide won
and he got soaked, right?

40:03.626 --> 40:07.376
Yeah, what an idiot.
Everyone knows you can't stop the sea.

40:09.210 --> 40:11.835
Um, I just wanted to ask
about those photographs

40:11.918 --> 40:13.198
of the fishermen in the hallway.

40:13.251 --> 40:15.168
Er, you don't happen
to know who took them?

40:15.876 --> 40:16.960
I did.

40:18.793 --> 40:19.835
Seriously?

40:21.585 --> 40:22.626
Well, they're fantastic.

40:23.251 --> 40:24.793
Thank you.

40:25.460 --> 40:28.585
It would be great if we had some pictures
of them to send out with the demo.

40:28.668 --> 40:30.585
I don't suppose you'd be interested?

40:30.668 --> 40:32.960
Yeah. What were you thinking?

40:33.043 --> 40:35.835
Well, something with a nautical theme
that would stand out

40:35.918 --> 40:37.335
in a supermarket checkout.

40:39.418 --> 40:40.876
Sounds a bit naff.

40:41.710 --> 40:44.001
Well, to be fair,
I haven't really given it much thought.

40:45.668 --> 40:48.626
Well, if you're interested in capturing
who they really are,

40:48.710 --> 40:50.168
that's something I can do.

40:51.335 --> 40:52.335
Great.

40:52.418 --> 40:57.793
- <i>♪ Le capitaine de St Malo ♪
- ♪ Ali alo ♪</i>

40:57.876 --> 41:00.585
<i>♪ Qui fait la peche au cachalot ♪</i>

41:00.668 --> 41:03.085
<i>♪ Ali, ali, ali alo ♪</i>

41:03.168 --> 41:04.543
Granfer, towards me.

41:05.293 --> 41:07.835
<i>- ♪ Ils a trois filles qui font la peau ♪</i>
- Chin out, chin down.

41:08.293 --> 41:09.876
Which one?

41:09.960 --> 41:12.293
You'll walk the bloody plank
if you keep that up.

41:12.376 --> 41:14.376
Magic, lads. Beautiful.

41:19.543 --> 41:22.585
- What does action man want?
- Coming to give us an hard time.

41:22.668 --> 41:24.418
And to make sure we can't earn a living.

41:24.501 --> 41:26.043
It's all right. I'll deal with them.

41:30.251 --> 41:32.876
We're not fishing today, Officer.
We're just taking a few photos.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.811
I'm still going to need to
check the hold and your log books.

41:35.835 --> 41:37.293
Twenty minutes, we lose the light.

41:37.793 --> 41:40.501
Officer, you're wasting your time
as well as ours.

41:40.585 --> 41:43.352
- You can see there's no fish.
- Stand back, sir. I'm only doing my job.

41:43.376 --> 41:46.585
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought your job
was to protect our shores.

41:47.335 --> 41:50.293
Not to harass ordinary working men
who are trying to earn a living.

41:50.793 --> 41:53.293
Do you know?
I think the taxpayer has a right to know

41:53.376 --> 41:55.293
how their hard-earned money
is being spent.

41:55.376 --> 41:56.585
Give us that.

41:57.001 --> 41:59.418
Smile.
Your 15 minutes of fame is about to start.

41:59.501 --> 42:02.335
- Put that away, sir.
- Or what?

42:11.043 --> 42:12.085
What did you get?

42:12.168 --> 42:13.960
Let me off with a caution.

42:14.043 --> 42:16.683
But I don't think I'll be getting
me fishing licence any time soon.

42:17.626 --> 42:19.335
Come on. Get in.

42:20.710 --> 42:22.835
My Dad'll kill me
if I'm late for quiz night.

42:44.001 --> 42:45.960
There he is, the hero of the hour.

42:46.418 --> 42:47.501
Thank you.

42:47.585 --> 42:49.626
You should come out with us more often,
son.

42:49.710 --> 42:52.710
- Buggers might stop bothering us then.
- Don't know about that.

42:52.793 --> 42:57.043
Eh, tribute, my ass. It's time to open
that rare bottle of Jamaican rum.

42:57.126 --> 42:58.835
Oh!

42:58.918 --> 43:00.668
Now, this is courtesy of a shipwreck.

43:00.751 --> 43:03.460
Father always used to say it was like
<i>Whiskey Galore</i> all over again.

43:05.293 --> 43:07.085
Oh, aye. Please, Lord.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.751
Let us pray for all those on the sea.

43:11.835 --> 43:16.001
If's there's going to be shipwrecks,
then send them to me!

43:17.626 --> 43:20.501
Although it wasn't always nature
taking its course, was it, Grandma?

43:20.585 --> 43:24.418
One of Mother's ancestors was hanged
at Bodmin Assizes in 1786,

43:24.501 --> 43:27.376
for waving a lantern up there
on the clifftop, see.

43:27.460 --> 43:29.960
Trying to lure passing ships
on to the rocks.

43:30.043 --> 43:32.668
Great, Great, Great, Great Uncle Hedrick.

43:32.751 --> 43:35.126
Mind, he was the black sheep
of the family, you know.

43:35.210 --> 43:37.418
Oh, he was a rascal.
He was a right heller.

43:39.210 --> 43:40.543
No resemblance then.

43:45.418 --> 43:47.293
- Alwyn.
- Trieve.

43:48.835 --> 43:52.501
Here, how's your general knowledge
then, son?

43:56.376 --> 43:59.126
<i>Okay. Next round.</i>

43:59.793 --> 44:00.918
<i>Music.</i>

44:01.335 --> 44:02.710
No pressure, Danny.

44:03.501 --> 44:06.460
<i>"Walk On By",
"Say A Little Prayer For Me",</i>

44:06.543 --> 44:12.335
<i>in the 1960's were both very big hits
for Dionne Warwick.</i>

44:12.960 --> 44:16.710
<i>Now, Burt Bacharach composed the music...</i>

44:17.626 --> 44:20.626
<i>but who wrote the lyrics?</i>

44:20.710 --> 44:22.668
- It's...
- Hal David. Hal David.

44:23.835 --> 44:26.126
- It's Hal David.
<i>- Number two.</i>

44:26.793 --> 44:33.210
<i>Which artist
has had the most weeks at the top</i>

44:33.293 --> 44:36.668
<i>of the UK Hit Parade ever?</i>

44:36.751 --> 44:39.126
- The Beatles.
- Elvis. Elvis.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.490
- It's the Beatles.
- It's Elvis.

44:40.543 --> 44:42.251
- Well, which is it?
- Dad, it's Elvis.

44:42.335 --> 44:43.436
- Put Elvis.
<i>- Three.</i>

44:43.460 --> 44:45.140
I thought this
was your specialist subject?

44:45.210 --> 44:46.293
So did I.

44:46.918 --> 44:50.668
<i>"Sorrow Is A Woman" was on which album?</i>

44:50.751 --> 44:51.918
All Through The Night!

44:52.001 --> 44:53.126
Hang on a minute.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.876
They got a bloody ringer on their team.

44:56.585 --> 44:59.460
Well, they can ask to have
another member if they want.

45:00.751 --> 45:02.960
You'd be better off sorting out
your own team,

45:03.043 --> 45:06.251
you miserable lot of town crows.

45:10.126 --> 45:12.085
Lost control of your wife again,
yarnigoat?

45:12.835 --> 45:13.835
- Jim.
- Dad!

45:13.918 --> 45:15.186
- Jim!
- Dad, leave it.

45:15.210 --> 45:16.418
Sit back down!

45:16.960 --> 45:19.585
Before I put you right on your arse!

45:21.335 --> 45:23.210
I done it before, Trieve.

45:23.585 --> 45:26.876
I would be so happy to do it again.

45:27.835 --> 45:30.835
Now, calm yourself down, lads.

45:31.418 --> 45:34.335
None of us wants to be hauled up
back in front of the magistrate.

45:36.543 --> 45:39.626
Come on, my darling. Sit down, sweetheart.
Come on. Sit down, love.

45:44.085 --> 45:47.251
I take it being called a yarnigoat
isn't a term of endearment.

45:47.335 --> 45:49.168
No. Far from it.

45:49.710 --> 45:51.210
I mean, the people from Padstow

45:51.293 --> 45:53.751
think that we spend
most of our time telling yarns.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.293
And we call them town crows

45:55.376 --> 46:00.251
because all they do is strut about town
crowing about how many fish they caught.

46:00.335 --> 46:01.335
Ah.

46:01.626 --> 46:03.418
So the goats and the crows, eh?

46:03.501 --> 46:06.876
- A bit like the Sharks and the Jets.
- Yeah, well, bloodier.

46:06.960 --> 46:10.085
Because back in the 1700s,
they used to send press gangs over here

46:10.168 --> 46:12.751
to grab our boys
and send them to the King's Navy.

46:14.085 --> 46:15.501
Ah.

46:17.126 --> 46:19.335
But it's also a bit more personal
than that.

46:20.668 --> 46:21.668
Ah?

46:22.876 --> 46:26.668
The guy that my dad was threatening,
he used to be my father-in-law.

46:29.835 --> 46:32.043
So, you were sleeping with the enemy.

46:33.251 --> 46:34.835
Yeah, you could say that.

46:37.085 --> 46:38.626
So, how long were you with him?

46:39.751 --> 46:41.335
Nearly five years.

46:42.293 --> 46:44.543
It was a really painful breakup, but...

46:45.335 --> 46:48.376
at least Tamsyn doesn't have to compete
with another child any more.

46:51.043 --> 46:52.501
- What about you?
- Hmm?

46:52.585 --> 46:53.710
You ever been married?

46:54.960 --> 46:56.043
Yeah,

46:56.126 --> 46:57.293
to the job.

46:57.960 --> 46:58.960
Thanks.

47:00.918 --> 47:02.085
I should go up.

47:02.793 --> 47:04.251
Early start for the school run.

47:07.043 --> 47:10.085
Who was the first artist to have
a posthumous number one in the UK?

47:11.460 --> 47:12.543
Otis Redding.

47:13.376 --> 47:14.876
"Dock of the Bay," 1968.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.376
Night, Danny.

47:20.835 --> 47:22.668
- Night, Dad.
- Night, my love.

47:26.210 --> 47:27.668
Fancy a nightcap, man?

47:30.543 --> 47:31.793
Yeah, yeah.

47:44.793 --> 47:47.126
Certainly beats the sounds of the city.

47:50.376 --> 47:51.376
Yeah.

47:56.293 --> 47:59.251
You... You got a girlfriend up there,
or what, then?

48:01.626 --> 48:02.626
No.

48:03.960 --> 48:07.210
Yeah. I'm yet to meet someone
who'll put up with me.

48:08.835 --> 48:09.835
Right.

48:15.251 --> 48:17.543
Saves you getting hurt, mind?

48:28.835 --> 48:31.710
Well. That's, uh... That's me, then.

48:33.501 --> 48:34.501
Night, Jim.

48:54.335 --> 48:57.335
Okay, just check
you've got your math book...

49:02.043 --> 49:03.293
All right. Come on, then.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.418
With the pub running at such a loss,

49:09.501 --> 49:12.251
I don't see you've got any choice
but to consider selling up.

49:12.335 --> 49:15.085
You know as well as anyone
how much the pub means to the village.

49:15.168 --> 49:19.210
I do. But you've got to consider
what's best for your family, Rowan.

49:22.585 --> 49:23.710
All right, Father.

49:25.543 --> 49:28.335
- How's my little mermaid then, eh?
- Fine.

49:29.043 --> 49:30.835
Go and see your great granfer, go on.

49:31.543 --> 49:32.668
Hey, princess!

49:32.751 --> 49:34.585
Why didn't she spend the weekend
with her dad?

49:35.293 --> 49:36.626
He didn't show up again.

49:38.710 --> 49:40.293
What kind of man does that?

49:41.751 --> 49:43.793
The kind I decided
not to spend my life with.

49:44.876 --> 49:47.001
Tamsyn, come on, darling.

49:50.585 --> 49:51.710
Be a good girl, all right?

49:52.293 --> 49:53.335
Say, "Bye."

49:59.793 --> 50:03.043
- They drink you dry last night?
- Yeah.

50:03.126 --> 50:05.043
Jago was the last man standing.

50:05.376 --> 50:08.001
Swaying, but standing.

50:08.085 --> 50:09.126
Catch you later.

50:09.210 --> 50:10.918
- Danny?
- Yeah?

50:11.376 --> 50:13.085
Have you got time for a quick chat?

50:13.501 --> 50:14.585
Yeah, sure.

50:19.293 --> 50:20.293
Come in, mate.

50:21.751 --> 50:24.418
I tried re-mortgaging,
but they won't accept.

50:24.501 --> 50:27.085
It's not surprising,
seeing as we aren't making much profit,

50:27.168 --> 50:28.335
any profit, in fact.

50:28.418 --> 50:30.960
Then, your solicitor
is probably right about selling up.

50:31.918 --> 50:35.001
What about the band? I mean,
could we make some money if it went well?

50:35.085 --> 50:37.668
Even if we do manage
to secure a record deal...

50:38.876 --> 50:41.960
anything the band makes,
you've got to split ten ways.

50:49.085 --> 50:50.085
Look.

50:50.751 --> 50:53.335
I might know someone
who'd be interested in buying the pub,

50:53.418 --> 50:56.626
if you were willing to do a private sale.
Cut out the middle man and all that.

50:56.710 --> 50:57.835
It's not that easy.

50:58.251 --> 51:00.543
This has always been
the heart of our village.

51:01.251 --> 51:03.126
It means a lot to a lot of people.

51:03.210 --> 51:05.918
In my experience, Rowan, emotions...

51:06.001 --> 51:07.626
They have no place in business.

51:16.293 --> 51:18.501
Danny, my man on the ground.

51:19.168 --> 51:21.293
I was just about to call you
for some local intel.

51:21.376 --> 51:22.376
Why, what's up?

51:22.751 --> 51:24.793
<i>Abigail's morphed into bridezilla.</i>

51:25.210 --> 51:27.876
<i>We need a UN peacekeeping envoy
to solve the seating plan</i>

51:27.960 --> 51:30.251
and we've just lost
the official wedding photographers.

51:30.626 --> 51:33.126
<i>Well, I think I can probably help you out
with the photos.</i>

51:33.376 --> 51:35.126
That would be great.

51:35.835 --> 51:36.876
<i>One more thing...</i>

51:37.376 --> 51:40.543
<i>Abigail keeps bugging me about having
the Fishermen sing at the reception.</i>

51:40.626 --> 51:41.626
Seriously?

51:41.668 --> 51:44.388
She wants to give our guests
a flavour of the real Cornwall.

51:44.460 --> 51:45.460
I don't know.

51:45.751 --> 51:47.376
<i>Okay, I'll see what I can do.</i>

51:48.001 --> 51:50.085
Listen, the reason
why I'm calling you, yeah...

51:50.418 --> 51:53.418
I've just had a tip-off.
The village pub is coming up for sale.

51:53.501 --> 51:55.501
I thought it might interest
your father-in-law.

51:55.585 --> 51:58.460
Nice spot.
I'll speak to him about it this evening.

51:58.543 --> 52:00.001
<i>- See you now. Bye.</i>
- Thanks, Danny.

52:01.918 --> 52:03.085
Heads up, lads.

52:03.835 --> 52:05.001
Good news.

52:05.085 --> 52:07.126
I've got you your first professional gig.

52:08.168 --> 52:11.460
Ah-ah. Before you get too excited,
it's only local.

52:11.543 --> 52:12.710
A place called Rock.

52:13.043 --> 52:14.876
That ain't local 'round here.

52:15.626 --> 52:17.727
Our head of Business Affairs
is getting married there.

52:17.751 --> 52:20.311
- We look like wedding singers to you?
- A lot of powerful people

52:20.376 --> 52:21.811
from the music industry will be there.

52:21.835 --> 52:24.085
Could be a great opportunity
for a showcase.

52:25.501 --> 52:26.501
Well, all right.

52:27.251 --> 52:29.085
We won't be taking any requests, mind.

52:29.668 --> 52:31.043
Come on, Dad. Give us a hand.

52:31.835 --> 52:32.835
Good man.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.602
Okay, big smile.

52:35.626 --> 52:36.835
Okay, this time looking at me.

52:36.918 --> 52:38.585
Gentlemen, you're gonna step over here.

52:39.085 --> 52:40.293
That way? That way.

52:40.376 --> 52:41.751
- Facing in.
- This way?

52:42.460 --> 52:44.293
And then all are facing
in the same direction.

52:44.376 --> 52:46.293
Wait, let me just check.
Oh, no, you're good.

52:46.376 --> 52:49.210
Big smiles.

52:55.418 --> 52:57.043
Lobbers Point. Men in the water.

53:09.335 --> 53:11.710
Hey. Hey, listen.

53:12.918 --> 53:14.626
I'm no photographer,

53:14.710 --> 53:18.210
but I can picture me and you together.

53:19.626 --> 53:21.876
Seriously, that's an image
that will never be captured.

53:24.043 --> 53:25.918
Well, that's a big bloody tent.

53:27.585 --> 53:28.835
Must have cost a bit.

53:30.251 --> 53:32.585
Henry passed on the details
of the Golden Lion.

53:32.668 --> 53:35.585
I have to say, I'm surprised
the family are thinking of selling up.

53:35.668 --> 53:36.710
The bloke's desperate.

53:37.543 --> 53:40.418
- And when's he thinking of off-loading it?
- The sooner the better.

53:40.793 --> 53:42.126
And your finder's fee?

53:43.126 --> 53:44.126
Two per cent.

53:45.585 --> 53:46.710
One and a half,

53:47.293 --> 53:48.960
- you've got yourself a deal.
- Done.

53:50.293 --> 53:51.293
I'll be in contact.

53:51.376 --> 53:52.876
- Lovely.
- Enjoy the wedding.

54:00.126 --> 54:02.001
All right. Grab my arm.

54:04.793 --> 54:05.793
Where's everyone else?

54:06.585 --> 54:08.251
They have something more important to do.

54:09.043 --> 54:10.043
Jago,

54:10.418 --> 54:12.793
you're singing
in front of some big players here.

54:12.876 --> 54:14.543
What can be more important than that?

54:14.626 --> 54:16.293
Saving lives, Danny.

54:19.418 --> 54:20.418
Yeah, okay.

54:21.251 --> 54:23.585
- You're sure you can handle the crowd?
- 'Course he can.

54:23.668 --> 54:26.293
He's Port Isaac's number one bingo caller.

54:26.376 --> 54:28.168
Testing. One, two.

54:28.251 --> 54:29.835
One, two.

54:29.918 --> 54:33.501
Hello, Kensington-on-Sea.

54:34.626 --> 54:40.168
We've played to uglier audiences,
but I can't recall one right now.

54:40.251 --> 54:42.418
Bloody hell.
They're a miserable bunch, inum?

54:42.501 --> 54:44.021
Danny, what the hell is going on here?

54:44.085 --> 54:46.168
Abigail wanted the Fishermen to perform.

54:46.501 --> 54:49.001
I thought half of London
was on antidepressants.

54:49.085 --> 54:50.751
Get on with it!

54:50.835 --> 54:51.960
Driss.

54:52.668 --> 54:53.835
You asked for it.

55:25.335 --> 55:27.135
This is not just your credibility

55:27.210 --> 55:28.293

55:28.376 --> 55:29.543

55:44.001 --> 55:46.918
But you cannot judge the band
on that performance alone, Troy.

55:47.001 --> 55:48.852
Oh, man.
Oh, they've been judged, man.

55:48.876 --> 55:51.637
They've been judged, and they've been
found guilty of being horseshit.

55:51.668 --> 55:53.876
They're something there.
All right? Trust me.

55:54.751 --> 55:58.376
I've heard them sing with genuine passion
about something we've all lost.

55:58.460 --> 56:00.543
The only thing you appear to have lost
is your mind.

56:00.626 --> 56:02.126
I'm talking about a way of life.

56:02.210 --> 56:05.501
A sense of community
that I didn't even know existed any more.

56:07.043 --> 56:10.126
I don't know what you've been smoking,
and quite frankly, I don't care.

56:10.210 --> 56:13.793
But as your boss, I am commanding you
to get rid of them now.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.418
Legally, you can't do that.

56:18.501 --> 56:19.543
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.501
Our arrangement
is that I have full control

56:22.585 --> 56:24.168
over every artist I sign.

56:25.210 --> 56:26.210
Yes.

56:28.835 --> 56:30.543
- Besides...
- Danny.

56:30.626 --> 56:32.186
I've already sent the album
out to the labels.

56:32.210 --> 56:33.626
You did what? You...

56:33.710 --> 56:34.710
I have to go.

56:34.793 --> 56:37.311
Something's gone wrong on the rescue.
Apparently, Dad went in the water.

56:37.335 --> 56:38.460
Is he okay?

56:38.543 --> 56:41.063
They're calling the coastguard,
but they're bringing him in now.

56:41.251 --> 56:42.811
Come on, darling. Come on. Let's go.

56:42.835 --> 56:43.918
I'll come with you.

57:00.626 --> 57:01.626
Father.

57:05.376 --> 57:06.460
Dad, are you okay?

57:09.168 --> 57:12.293
<i>Sea mist came in.
The navigation system failed.</i>

57:12.376 --> 57:14.418
Boat ended up on the rocks
at Lobber point.

57:14.501 --> 57:15.585
Broke up in minutes.

57:15.668 --> 57:17.835
By the time we got there,
there were two in the water.

57:17.918 --> 57:19.158
Now, we got 'em both out, mind.

57:22.460 --> 57:24.436
<i>We must get you
to the hospital now, Mr Trevellion.</i>

57:24.460 --> 57:27.293
You've had a nasty knock to the head.
Suspected concussion.

57:27.376 --> 57:28.769
Time for being brave is over.

57:28.793 --> 57:30.436
Dad, just do as they ask.

57:30.460 --> 57:33.001
- Enough. I'm going home.
- Jim.

57:33.085 --> 57:34.925
- Uh, Mr Trevellion.
- Dad.

57:37.626 --> 57:38.626
Stubborn!

57:42.835 --> 57:45.126
Your dad is one of the toughest blokes
I know.

57:47.960 --> 57:50.560
- <i>Sorry we let you down, Danny.
- How'd it go?</i>

57:55.001 --> 57:56.085
They did you proud.

58:14.293 --> 58:15.293
Oh!

58:15.585 --> 58:16.585
Hello, Tamsyn.

58:18.001 --> 58:20.126
What you doing sitting out here
on your own?

58:20.210 --> 58:21.460
Waiting for my dad.

58:30.376 --> 58:32.543
- You want me to wait with you?
- Sure.

58:38.793 --> 58:42.835
Is it true you're gonna turn Granfer Jim
into a famous pop star like Justin Bieber?

58:44.835 --> 58:46.335
Well, I'm gonna try.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.835
Do you think he's got the X factor?

58:50.668 --> 58:53.626
Well, uh, the thing
about being a Belieber...

58:55.168 --> 58:57.043
is that anything is possible, right?

59:00.335 --> 59:02.126
- Here you go.
- Hmm.

59:03.793 --> 59:04.793

59:05.626 --> 59:06.751

59:07.335 --> 59:09.210

you're back out on the boat?

59:09.668 --> 59:10.668

59:12.251 --> 59:13.251

59:13.668 --> 59:15.210
Yeah, it's like <i>mañana.</i>

59:15.918 --> 59:16.918
Only slower.

59:20.251 --> 59:21.710
- Granfer?
- Yeah?

59:22.501 --> 59:24.335
My dad's not coming, is he?

59:25.376 --> 59:27.835
No, I don't think he is, sweetheart,
but...

59:29.335 --> 59:32.043
Maybe he just got held up. That's all, eh?

59:36.001 --> 59:37.376
How about we go and ask your mum

59:37.460 --> 59:39.668

we can all do together instead?

01:01:07.376 --> 01:01:10.210
Nobody wants to be the man
who missed out on signing the Beatles.

01:01:12.876 --> 01:01:15.126

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.376
Sorry. It's just, uh, you know...

You know as well as I do that...

01:04:20.168 --> 01:04:22.085

01:04:55.376 --> 01:04:56.710
I asked for croissants,

01:04:56.793 --> 01:04:59.876
she said, "You're in Cornwall,
my lover, not Calais!"

He's always been protective.

01:05:27.585 --> 01:05:28.710
I don't blame him.

01:05:31.668 --> 01:05:34.543
Ever since he discovered
my mum was having an affair,

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.543
he's found it hard to trust anyone.

01:05:37.793 --> 01:05:38.793
What happened?

01:05:39.376 --> 01:05:40.376
She left him...

01:05:41.085 --> 01:05:43.626

from the Isle of Wight.

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:46.793

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:05.876
Well, why does he want
to slag 'em off to the labels like that?

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:11.585
Yeah, I'll tell you what. Do me a favour.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:14.085
Tell him I don't want to be associated
with <i>him</i> any more.

01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:17.001
Lads.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.960
We've been sabotaged.

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.418
It's my former boss.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.210
He isn't a fan of your music,

01:06:23.293 --> 01:06:26.126
and he's been pressurising the labels
not to take the album.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:28.043
What do you mean, your "former boss"?

01:06:30.376 --> 01:06:32.001
- I resigned.
- Resign?

01:06:32.085 --> 01:06:34.501
What'd you do that for, you daft bugger?

01:06:35.168 --> 01:06:36.418
Because I believe in you.

01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:42.168
I believe in the music, and
I believe I can secure you a record deal.

01:06:42.626 --> 01:06:45.168
Well, you're a stubborn sod.
I'll give you that.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:46.710
Takes one to know one.

01:06:48.085 --> 01:06:50.251

A pound a pair to avoid the glare?

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.210

the well-known Irish singer said, Jim.

01:07:11.668 --> 01:07:14.376
"I may be plain old Paul Hewson
from Dublin.

Nineteen sixty-four.

01:09:51.585 --> 01:09:54.460
I was on shore leave in the merchant navy.

01:09:54.543 --> 01:09:56.460

01:09:56.543 --> 01:09:59.418
Rosie was my very first love.

Him and half the British fleet.

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.460
And he was the only wazzock
to make a permanent declaration.

01:10:07.751 --> 01:10:09.418

01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:12.376
- Otherwise, I'd have never met his mother.
- That's true.

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:14.418
Who's the lead singer of the group?

01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:17.626
- Well, nobody. We take it in turns.
- That's very democratic.

01:10:18.293 --> 01:10:20.668
So, what kind of songs
do you guys perform?

01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:21.918
Shanties.

01:15:13.751 --> 01:15:14.751

I guarantee you've never heard
anything like that before.

01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:32.876
The song they were singing
was about prostitution.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.043
Yes.

01:15:34.126 --> 01:15:36.960
So was "Roxanne."
That didn't work out too badly for Sting.

01:15:39.376 --> 01:15:40.668
Look, come on, Leah.

01:15:41.835 --> 01:15:45.210
We may live in the age of <i>The X Factor,</i>
but what that show has taught us

01:15:45.293 --> 01:15:48.710
is that the public love to see
real people with real talent.

01:15:49.501 --> 01:15:51.418
And it doesn't get any more real

01:15:51.501 --> 01:15:55.626
than singing fishermen
who risk their lives out at sea every day.

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:58.376
I mean, think of the marketing angles.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.543
You won't just be signing a new act.

01:16:00.626 --> 01:16:03.335
You'll be signing 500 years
of naval history.

01:16:07.376 --> 01:16:09.168
I'm sorry, Danny.

01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:11.835
You know how much ongoing business
we've got with Troy.

01:16:11.918 --> 01:16:16.210
If I take a punt on Popeye and his pals,
I'd risk jeopardising that.

01:16:17.043 --> 01:16:19.710
All I'm asking for
is a basic one-album deal.

01:16:19.793 --> 01:16:21.043
You'll spend less on this

01:16:21.126 --> 01:16:24.210
than you would on a music video
for one of your A-list artists.

01:16:25.251 --> 01:16:26.793
- I'm sorry, Danny.
- Leah.

01:16:27.418 --> 01:16:28.626
Maybe next time.

01:16:40.876 --> 01:16:44.501
Don't be too hard on yourself, Danny.

01:16:44.585 --> 01:16:46.460
You give it your best shot.

01:16:47.043 --> 01:16:49.210
Wasn't good enough though, was it, Jago?

01:16:49.293 --> 01:16:50.710
Hello, Danny?

01:16:52.376 --> 01:16:53.376
Afternoon, Sian.

01:16:54.085 --> 01:16:55.501
That was fantastic.

01:16:55.585 --> 01:16:58.751
Shame the powers that be
didn't think so.

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:02.085
Well, I've got a TV show
that are looking for someone to step in

01:17:02.168 --> 01:17:04.918
and sing the national anthem
for the queen's birthday next week.

01:17:05.001 --> 01:17:07.668
We've had a last-minute dropout,
if you're interested.

01:17:10.043 --> 01:17:12.043
Let me run it past the boys.

01:17:15.335 --> 01:17:19.043
Look, I know
this isn't what we had in mind,

01:17:19.126 --> 01:17:22.710
but this could be a golden opportunity
to reach a wider audience.

01:17:27.126 --> 01:17:29.293
Jim, at least consider it.

01:17:35.085 --> 01:17:38.043
Yeah, we'd be honoured to, my fair maiden.

01:17:38.126 --> 01:17:39.168
We would?

01:17:39.251 --> 01:17:40.585
We would.

01:17:41.876 --> 01:17:45.876
And now to celebrate the queen's birthday,
something a little different.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.043
Singing the national anthem,
live from Cornwall,

01:17:49.126 --> 01:17:51.460
are Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends.

01:18:35.876 --> 01:18:38.126
- You got time for a quick word?
- Uh, yeah, sure. What?

01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:40.001
- What the hell was that?
- What?

01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:42.335
That.

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:43.751
We're patriots, Danny.

01:18:43.835 --> 01:18:46.519
Yeah, so are all the people tuning in
to hear the queen's national anthem.

01:18:46.543 --> 01:18:50.001
And you've just gone and alienated
every single last one of them!

01:18:50.085 --> 01:18:52.168
And spoiled our chances of a knighthood.

01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:54.126
Come on.

01:18:58.585 --> 01:19:01.376
That's it. I got nothing left.

01:19:02.668 --> 01:19:07.418
Can you assure me
that it's always gonna be a public house?

01:19:08.126 --> 01:19:10.585
That's certainly my intention, Rowan.

01:19:11.751 --> 01:19:13.793
We don't have a choice, love.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.460
So, do we have ourselves a deal, or what?

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:30.168
- What's going on?
- The inevitable.

01:19:32.793 --> 01:19:34.793
Does Jim know?

01:19:34.876 --> 01:19:36.168
Nobody does.

01:19:37.001 --> 01:19:39.293
Rowan's gotta find
the right moment to explain.

01:19:40.126 --> 01:19:41.376
Congratulations.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.460
A pleasure doing business with you.

01:19:51.376 --> 01:19:53.793
I can't believe
they're up to a million hits.

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.918
Look at the state of them.

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:59.126
I mean, who even dresses like that?

01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:01.585
Have you been to Hoxton lately?

01:20:01.668 --> 01:20:04.585
It's all nautical tattoos
and Breton sweaters and facial hair.

01:21:30.918 --> 01:21:32.418
Done.

For the purposes of the general public,

01:21:34.085 --> 01:21:36.876
could we maybe get a little creative
with the signing-on fee?

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.793
How creative?

01:21:44.585 --> 01:21:46.918
There's no way he got a million quid.

01:21:47.585 --> 01:21:49.085

01:22:09.418 --> 01:22:11.710
Mother always said I'd be a late bloomer.

Eh?

01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:19.626
I thought you said
they'd interviewed everyone.

01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:22.335
- They did.
- How come my Jago wasn't on the telly?

01:23:22.418 --> 01:23:25.085
Some faces are only made for the radio,
Maggie.

01:23:27.543 --> 01:23:29.210
Here.

01:23:29.293 --> 01:23:34.543
They say you can tell a man

01:23:37.293 --> 01:23:39.668
I ain't surprised
me reputation's in tatters.

01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:44.335
But, uh, seriously though...

01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:50.168
I've known most of ees
since you was this high.

01:23:50.876 --> 01:23:53.126
I've helped some of you learn to walk,

01:23:53.210 --> 01:23:55.626
talk, fish,

01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:57.501
and, in a few cases, sing.

01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:02.501
But you've given me back
so much more than I can...

01:24:02.585 --> 01:24:04.710
- that I could ever...
- Oh, Dad.

01:24:04.793 --> 01:24:07.501
Come on, guys.

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:09.251
I...

01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:14.043
I'd like to say a few words, if he can't.

01:24:14.126 --> 01:24:18.168
When we first devised the plan
to escape the wives once a week

01:24:18.251 --> 01:24:20.751
for rehearsal...

01:24:21.251 --> 01:24:22.918
Speak for yourself, boy.

01:24:23.001 --> 01:24:25.001
...all those years ago,

01:24:25.085 --> 01:24:28.001
none of us would ever have believed
we'd end up with a record deal.

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.001
I-I-I was the most sceptical,
I will admit that,

01:24:33.085 --> 01:24:35.085
of anyone here.

01:24:35.168 --> 01:24:36.793
It's all been down to the...

01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:40.376
the tenacity and belief of one man.

01:24:41.585 --> 01:24:43.835
- Danny Anderson.
- Yeah!

01:24:45.418 --> 01:24:49.626
So I'll make a toast.
To old friends and new.

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:51.751
Old friends and new!

01:25:10.418 --> 01:25:11.835
Is that Jago?

01:25:12.751 --> 01:25:14.376
Mm-hmm.

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.335
And Rowan's dad, Kenwyn.

01:25:17.168 --> 01:25:19.543
That's outside the old lifeboat station.

01:25:20.418 --> 01:25:21.858
They were both part of the same crew

01:25:21.918 --> 01:25:24.251
that answered an emergency call
at Hawker's Cove.

01:25:25.126 --> 01:25:29.585
And during the rescue, a freak wave
hit the lifeboat and capsized it.

01:25:29.668 --> 01:25:31.626
They were the only two members to survive.

01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:34.251
Well, Kenwyn never got over it.

01:25:34.335 --> 01:25:35.876
He didn't go out to sea again.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.269
And then when the village
was granted a new lifeboat house,

01:25:38.293 --> 01:25:41.460
then Kenwyn bought the old one
and turned it into the Golden Lion.

01:25:42.918 --> 01:25:44.918
That's why it's so important to us all.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.501
- Danny.
<i>- Henry?</i>

01:26:06.585 --> 01:26:09.626

01:26:10.376 --> 01:26:11.918
Incommunicado, I'm afraid.

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:14.085

01:26:16.418 --> 01:26:17.626

May you have fair seas
and following winds.

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:04.668
Need to make sure
the new owners keep that pump on.

01:29:04.751 --> 01:29:07.543
Don't know what I'd do without
my pint of Tribute of an evening.

01:29:07.626 --> 01:29:08.626
Thanks, John.

01:29:09.585 --> 01:29:12.210
New owners, did you say, was that?

01:29:12.293 --> 01:29:15.251
What's that about new owners, Rowan?

01:29:19.793 --> 01:29:21.626
I didn't have a choice, Jim.

01:29:22.668 --> 01:29:25.376
There was no other way to settle the debt.

01:29:29.001 --> 01:29:31.918
Well, why didn't you come
and speak to me about it?

01:29:32.001 --> 01:29:36.043
I wanted to tell you,
but what with the band and the baby and...

01:29:36.126 --> 01:29:38.418
well, then your father, I...

01:29:39.085 --> 01:29:42.543
- Th-There just hasn't been a right moment.
- Who bought it then?

01:29:45.335 --> 01:29:47.376
Charles Montegue.

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.543
You sold it to that grabbin' bastard?

01:29:49.626 --> 01:29:54.043
'Twas his ancestors who drove us overseas
and down the bloody mines.

01:29:54.126 --> 01:29:57.376
He offered a fair price,
and he promised to keep it as a pub.

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.460
You've been a damn fool, Rowan.

01:30:01.668 --> 01:30:04.835
Businessman like Charles Montegue...

01:30:05.793 --> 01:30:09.001
he's not gonna want to
keep this place as it is.

01:30:09.085 --> 01:30:11.251
He's gonna want to make
a tidy profit out of it.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.918
That'll probably mean turning it into
one of them boutique hotels or summat.

01:30:17.001 --> 01:30:20.085
There'll be no place here for us.
You do know that, don't you?

01:30:20.168 --> 01:30:22.210
Well, that's not true. Is it, Danny?

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:26.710
- What's it got to do with Danny?
- Well, he made the introduction.

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:36.418
Rowan came to me for business advice.
He was in an impossible situation.

01:30:37.251 --> 01:30:40.668
Oh, you... you went to an emmet?

01:30:40.751 --> 01:30:42.335
In your hour of need?

01:30:42.418 --> 01:30:46.668
Rowan and Sally
didn't make this decision easily, my son.

01:30:46.751 --> 01:30:48.543
Wh... Y-You knew?

01:30:48.626 --> 01:30:51.335
Well, what else would you lot
want him to do?

01:30:51.418 --> 01:30:53.626
Go bankrupt? Be homeless?

01:30:53.710 --> 01:30:56.168
Look, I'm sorry.

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:57.918
I was just trying to help.

01:30:58.001 --> 01:31:00.668
You're only sorry
because you were found out.

01:31:00.751 --> 01:31:04.210
You're just full of showbiz bullshit,
aren't you, son?

01:31:04.293 --> 01:31:05.835
Huh?

01:31:05.918 --> 01:31:10.335
With your million-pound record deals
and your fake handshakes and all that.

01:31:10.418 --> 01:31:12.710
Jim, look. Listen, just hear me out.

01:31:12.793 --> 01:31:15.501
When I spoke to Rowan,
I didn't know anything about the pub,

01:31:15.585 --> 01:31:17.626
its history,
or what it means to the community.

01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:19.626
But you know now because I told you.

01:31:19.710 --> 01:31:22.293
Yeah, but by then
the deal had already gone through.

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:24.460
So you were getting a cut, were you?

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.751
And you didn't want to risk
losing your commission.

01:31:28.835 --> 01:31:31.293
No, Alwyn, wait.

01:31:41.418 --> 01:31:43.543
Alwyn!

01:31:44.335 --> 01:31:45.751
Let me explain!

01:31:53.043 --> 01:31:55.543
Alwyn, please, just hear me out!

01:31:57.751 --> 01:31:59.111
Keep your voice down.

01:31:59.168 --> 01:32:01.918
Go away, Danny. I'm not interested
in anything you've got to say.

01:32:02.001 --> 01:32:04.251
No, wait, wait! Look, um...

01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:07.293
I-I-I'm gonna talk to Charles.

01:32:07.376 --> 01:32:09.335
I-I'll make sure things don't change.

01:32:09.418 --> 01:32:11.085
Everything's changed.

01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:18.043
Cornish oak, my ass.

01:32:19.001 --> 01:32:22.793
Your word is like... It's like willow...

01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:25.585
blowing in the wind.

01:32:25.668 --> 01:32:26.668
Yeah.

01:32:26.751 --> 01:32:30.710
I warned you
not to take the piss out of us.

01:32:30.793 --> 01:32:34.251
And I warned you not to hurt my daughter.

01:32:34.335 --> 01:32:36.835
It wasn't intentional, Jim. I promise.

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:39.501
I think it might be time
for you to leave, Danny.

01:32:40.876 --> 01:32:45.293
Unless you want me to drag you
through the River Tamar myself.

Because I'd like something else instead.

01:36:29.085 --> 01:36:31.126
Come on, Dad.

01:36:31.210 --> 01:36:33.251
This isn't the time to be stubborn.

01:36:33.335 --> 01:36:35.335
It's Rowan and Sally's
last day at the pub.

01:36:35.418 --> 01:36:38.376
No, I'm... I'm in no mood for a drink.

01:36:39.168 --> 01:36:42.043
Don't you think you've made your point?

01:36:42.126 --> 01:36:44.168
Rowan has torn the heart
out of this village.

01:36:46.251 --> 01:36:48.835
The heart of the village isn't the pub,
Dad.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.126
It's the people.

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.460
I owe you an apology, Rowan.

01:37:17.543 --> 01:37:19.543
I-I've been a stubborn fool.

01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:23.418
You did what you did
for the sake of your family,

01:37:23.501 --> 01:37:26.293
and I should never have let that
come between us.

01:37:27.668 --> 01:37:29.043
I'm sorry.

01:37:31.043 --> 01:37:32.876
One and all?

01:37:34.543 --> 01:37:35.960
One and all.

01:37:40.876 --> 01:37:42.126
- The usual?
- Yeah.

01:37:42.210 --> 01:37:44.168
That's more like it, mate.

01:37:57.668 --> 01:38:00.085
Come on. Come on!

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.876
Top 40's on in a minute.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:07.376
I'd tune into the top 400 if I were you.

01:38:08.126 --> 01:38:10.293
- Dad!
- Don't be such a pessimist!

01:38:14.376 --> 01:38:15.960
Danny!

01:38:16.043 --> 01:38:17.793
Tamsyn. Oh.

01:38:18.585 --> 01:38:20.460
I missed you.

01:38:20.543 --> 01:38:22.543
What you doing here then?

01:38:31.418 --> 01:38:34.876
I came here to tell you that the pub is
gonna remain the way it always has been.

01:38:36.335 --> 01:38:38.043
How's that possible?

01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:42.126
Because I bought it.

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:45.793
Well, in case you've forgotten,

01:38:45.876 --> 01:38:48.210
we're not too fond
of second-home owners round here.

01:38:48.293 --> 01:38:50.293
Well, that's good,
because I've only got one.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.793
I gave Charles Montegue my London flat
in exchange for this.

01:38:59.126 --> 01:39:01.626
And I'd like Rowan and Sally
to keep it running.

01:39:02.376 --> 01:39:04.293
Did you hear that?

01:39:07.876 --> 01:39:09.293
Alwyn, wait.

01:39:10.918 --> 01:39:12.501
Alwyn, uh, wait.

01:39:12.585 --> 01:39:14.835
- Wait, please.
- What are you doing, Danny?

01:39:16.251 --> 01:39:17.894
Just because
you made things right with the pub,

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:20.126
that doesn't mean
you made things right with me.

01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:22.043
I'm not expecting anything.

01:39:24.335 --> 01:39:28.335
I want you to know that I've done a lot
of thinking over the last few months.

01:39:29.751 --> 01:39:31.585
Everything I thought I cared about...

01:39:32.668 --> 01:39:36.876
money, status,
the flat, the cars, the toys...

01:39:40.001 --> 01:39:41.585
none of them have ever made me happy.

01:39:44.793 --> 01:39:47.668
But being down here
with you and Tamsyn did.

01:39:49.543 --> 01:39:51.585
Come on, you two!

01:39:51.668 --> 01:39:54.126
You're missing the countdown. Come on!

01:40:05.710 --> 01:40:06.918
