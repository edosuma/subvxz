00:08.356 --> 00:09.792
Did it work?"
- No.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.490
He still doesn't follow.
- Lisa, Bill from Manhattan

00:12.534 --> 00:14.840

why they called it quits

00:14.884 --> 00:17.060

the eject button first.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.672
- I think you just have to read
the press, and Amelia did.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.502
- Can't control the mouth.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.156
- Crystal, you were
in the middle of Dorit

00:26.200 --> 00:27.505

on the plane.

00:27.549 --> 00:28.724
Who was in the wrong?
- Yeah, Crystal.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.291
-
- Why are you, like--like,

00:30.334 --> 00:32.206
turning to me
very aggressively right now?

00:32.728 --> 00:36.558
- I like being able to have
that banter with my friends.

00:36.601 --> 00:39.039
Am I boring you?
- Oh, damn.

00:39.561 --> 00:42.564
- You were not happy
when the first season aired.

00:42.607 --> 00:46.263
- I kept thinking about my mom.
Like, what would my mom do?

00:51.790 --> 00:53.705
- I gave every paycheck
to my husband.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.533
- How many mistresses
do you think he had?

00:55.577 --> 00:56.708
- I know of three.

00:56.752 --> 00:57.883
- Why didn't you leave
Tom sooner?

00:57.927 --> 00:59.189
- Where was I going?

00:59.233 --> 01:00.843
- Did you feel you were
held captive?

01:00.886 --> 01:02.584
How long do you think
he was unfaithful?

01:02.627 --> 01:05.152
- Years.
- Were you faithful to him?

01:22.343 --> 01:26.782
Erika, why not leave Tom sooner
if he was cheating on you?

01:26.825 --> 01:31.743
- The cheating is a part of it.
There's so much more there.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.354
And I've said to Tom,

01:33.397 --> 01:36.444
"If you are in love
with someone else, divorce me."

01:36.487 --> 01:38.315
- He said?

01:38.359 --> 01:40.491
- Nothing.
- Zero.

for divorce, yeah.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.726
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.555
- Well, this season,
Erika shocked everyone

02:00.598 --> 02:03.210
when she filed
for divorce from Tom.

02:03.253 --> 02:06.343
But as she confided in her
friends, they soon learned

02:06.387 --> 02:08.911
Erika's
seemingly perfect marriage

02:08.954 --> 02:12.132
was more of a pretty mess.
Watch.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.744
- Tom and I had dinner
every night together,

02:15.787 --> 02:17.267
and it was nice to talk

02:17.311 --> 02:20.444
and just kind of reconnect
in a way.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.273
I'm really content
to let people be who they are,

02:23.317 --> 02:24.709
and that's one of
the one things I love

02:24.753 --> 02:26.885
about Tom the most,
is he lets me be myself.

When he called me,
I said, "Where have you been?"

03:15.891 --> 03:19.329
I was just assuming
he was with some other woman.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.723
- He was cheating on you.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.725
- Oh, sh--.

03:23.768 --> 03:26.249
- One of the reasons
that I filed for divorce

03:26.293 --> 03:28.382
is the resistance
to a conversation.

03:30.775 --> 03:33.691
My God.
That's--no, he's not an angel.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.519
As much as Tom encouraged me,

03:35.563 --> 03:37.260
I think he resented me
every step I took forward.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.523
He was like, "Who the
do you think you are?"

I'd go to hug him, and...

03:44.311 --> 03:46.661
He wouldn't hug me back.

- We've seen you with Tom,

04:08.030 --> 04:11.294

a very rosy picture...

- Of your time with him.

"she's backing up a moving van
to the mansion,

and a cheater."

04:37.799 --> 04:39.583
So, talk to me about that.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.846
Why hide the fact that you're
in a broken marriage?

04:41.890 --> 04:44.588
- All marriages are complex.
People are complex.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.329
There were good times.
There were bad times.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.505
You're talking about
two decades of a marriage.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.724
- Okay.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.856
- So, no one's
marriage is perfect.

- Do you think you went far
in the other direction

04:56.034 --> 04:58.602

04:58.646 --> 05:00.952

You're on a hit TV show.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.786
You have a career.
- Andy. Hold on.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.875
I was not in control
of my finances.

05:10.919 --> 05:13.835

Who am I gonna go call?

on this show.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.540
It ain't bad.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.150

05:26.195 --> 05:27.544
- Oh, wow.
- So crazy to me.

05:27.588 --> 05:28.719
- Why? Why?
- Forever?

05:28.763 --> 05:30.634
Since you've been making money?
- Yes.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.550
I've handed every paycheck
I've ever made over.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.030
- Would you say you stayed
with him

05:35.073 --> 05:36.640
for the money and the security?
- No.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.469
I stayed
because I had no access.

05:39.513 --> 05:42.037
- Did you feel you
were held captive?

05:44.474 --> 05:47.085
I was 27 when I went in.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.522
- Cocktail waitress.
- He was 60.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.611
The power balance
is way out of whack.

05:50.654 --> 05:53.091
I trusted this mean.
All of my finances

05:53.135 --> 05:57.487
were kept down at the firm,
and everything was kept there.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.402
- Then that sounds
like you did say for the--

05:59.446 --> 06:00.664
- Hold on.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.753
You're characterizing it
as "for the money."

06:02.797 --> 06:04.494
I'm telling you
I could not leave

06:04.538 --> 06:06.583
because I had no access
to the money.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.237
- Okay.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.847
- Regardless of how much money
there is, many women feel like

06:09.891 --> 06:11.632
they can't leave because
they don't have access...

06:11.675 --> 06:12.850
- That's right.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.069
- And they don't have
independence.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.072
- Listen, it doesn't matter
how much is on deposit.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.595
- Right.
- If you can't access it,

06:18.639 --> 06:19.944
you can't--
- You've got nothing.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.685
- What are you gonna do?
- Weren't you, though,

06:21.729 --> 06:22.817
entitled to half of everything?

06:22.860 --> 06:24.775
You were with him
for over ten years.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.082
- Well, clearly I'm entitled
to half of the debt,

06:27.125 --> 06:28.910
because everybody's
suing me for it.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.651
- Right.

06:30.694 --> 06:33.915
Over the years,
he's having multiple affairs.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.917
You're saying, "I stayed it in.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.614
"It was
an old-fashioned relationship.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.616
I didn't have access
to anything."

06:39.660 --> 06:43.011
What I'm saying to you is,
if you had left,

06:43.054 --> 06:45.622
wouldn't you legally
have been entitled to

06:45.666 --> 06:47.537
half of what there was.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.147
- And I responded yes.

06:49.191 --> 06:52.847
I'm on for half the liability
and on for half the assets.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.065
- But you didn't know

06:54.109 --> 06:55.545
that there was
liability at the time.

06:55.589 --> 06:56.720
- Which time?

06:56.764 --> 06:57.939
- Did you?
- No.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.897
And that is a big part
of this whole--

06:59.941 --> 07:02.073
all of these lawsuits

07:02.117 --> 07:03.901
that are being alleged.
- Well,

07:03.945 --> 07:05.512
did you know

07:05.555 --> 07:08.732
that there was liability
when you left him?

07:08.776 --> 07:12.083
Did you feel
that the ship was sinking

07:12.127 --> 07:13.650
and you were about
to go down with it,

07:13.694 --> 07:15.260
and you had
to get out at that time?

07:15.304 --> 07:18.829
- I felt like he was sinking,
not necessarily "the ship."

07:18.873 --> 07:20.831
There was no talking
to this person.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.704
Trying to get him
to answer my questions,

07:23.747 --> 07:26.750
being shut out
completely--anger,

07:26.794 --> 07:28.186
personality changes.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.711
And you can see now--look,
the man is in a home.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.539
He's in a memory care facility.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.889
We've all seen the pictures
of him with the black eye.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.543
- Right.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.241
- We've seen how disheveled
and how absolutely horrible

07:39.284 --> 07:41.983
he has deteriorated
since I left in November.

07:42.026 --> 07:46.117
So, what I have been
saying is true.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.077
It's not unusual in Tom's
business for him to be sued.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.646
But when Erika Girardi
started ending up on lawsuits,

07:52.689 --> 07:54.125
that's when my ears
were pricked.

07:54.169 --> 07:57.172
You remember I--it was Denise's
first reunion,

07:57.215 --> 08:00.088
and I think that you brought up
I was being sued.

08:00.131 --> 08:03.700
- Monty from Nevada said,
"Erika's happy to talk about

08:03.744 --> 08:06.050
"Lisa Vanderpump all day,
but when it comes to Tom

08:06.094 --> 08:10.577
defaulting on a $15 million
loan, she doesn't say a word."

08:10.620 --> 08:13.710
- How about this?
Resolved, and they apologized.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.277
You have to understand
something.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.585
It's like a wall of people
around this man.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.022
You have many lawyer--

08:21.065 --> 08:24.591
that I can only access
a certain part of it.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.722
- Did you call people

08:25.766 --> 08:26.941
at the firm and say...
- No.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.333
- "Am I on the hook for this?"
- No.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.161
I called lawyers
that I knew, yes.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.250
- And they said what?
- Hold on.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.949
I am not at liberty to say what

08:34.992 --> 08:37.647
and at what time
I sought legal counsel.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.257
- Okay.
- Okay?

08:39.301 --> 08:40.824
- Let me go back
to some viewer questions.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.652
Celeste from Odessa, Texas
said,

08:42.696 --> 08:45.263
"Erika, it's been ten months
since you filed for divorce,

08:45.307 --> 08:46.743
"and there's no money
to fight over.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.266
Why hasn't your divorce
been finalized yet?"

08:48.310 --> 08:50.660
- Competency hearing.
- "Is his conservatorship

08:50.704 --> 08:52.357
the reason your divorce
has been delayed?"

08:52.401 --> 08:53.663
- Yes. Yes.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.143
- Liz Poppy tweeted,

08:55.186 --> 08:57.841
"Why did you lie to Garcelle
about Tom's infidelity?

08:57.885 --> 09:00.148
You told her point-blank
there were no other women."

09:00.191 --> 09:02.759
- Because of who it was.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.674
But just a little
'nother nugget,

09:04.718 --> 09:06.110
there was--there were others.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.329
- How many mistresses

09:07.372 --> 09:09.592
do you think
he had during the marriage?

09:09.636 --> 09:11.159
- I know of three.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.814
- Did you confront him
about each one?

09:13.857 --> 09:16.077
- Two. One I found out
on the day that I left.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.644
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.036
- How?
- I went through his phone,

09:19.080 --> 09:20.777
and she had sent
a picture of her tits.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.823
And he has a flip phone,
you know, so I responded,

09:22.866 --> 09:24.259
"Nice tits, stupid bitch."

09:24.302 --> 09:26.217
But I couldn't even figure out
how to put a space,

09:26.261 --> 09:27.915
so it was
like-like a run-on sentence.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.614
- Right, because you have
used to have to go down...

09:31.658 --> 09:32.920
- I don't know how to do it!
- Flip phone!

09:32.963 --> 09:34.617
- I mean, this is the truth.
You wanted it?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.053
Here it is. I'm sorry.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.882
<i>- Coming up next...</i>

09:38.926 --> 09:41.015
"I clicked on the auction
for Tom's law firm.

09:41.058 --> 09:43.931
"Almost choked when I saw
those panties for sale.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.716
"Please explain to me why
there were lacy panties

09:46.760 --> 09:48.239
in your husband's desk drawer?"

09:48.283 --> 09:50.111
- I'm done.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.383
- Wyatt from Springdale,
Arkansas said,

10:01.426 --> 10:05.430
"Kyle, what rumors did you hear
about Tom's affairs,

10:05.474 --> 10:08.433
and why didn't you tell Erika
about them earlier?"

10:08.477 --> 10:11.045
- You know--
- Go ahead, babe. It's fine.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.524
- No. But you know,
you hear rumblings--

10:12.568 --> 10:13.874
- You told--you told
Erika that...

10:13.917 --> 10:15.397
- No.
- You had heard rumblings.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.443
- No. Maybe--there was
little hints--like, people say

10:18.487 --> 10:20.228
Erika acted
like everything was great.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.056
She would give little hints
that things weren't so great.

10:22.099 --> 10:24.188
I could feel that
she wasn't always happy.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.147
You know, she'd make
a little joke here and there.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.627
Like, Mauricio's calling
to check, she's like,

10:27.670 --> 10:29.585
"Would be nice if Tom"--
you know, things like that.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.500
I could always feel that
he wasn't kind to her.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.110
He really wasn't.
And then I would hear

10:33.154 --> 10:34.895
these little stories, too,
on the sides.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.592
But we hear so many rumors
about so many people...

10:36.636 --> 10:37.898
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.073
- I would think,
"Oh, who even cares."

10:39.116 --> 10:40.509
- You just hear tons of rumors.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.250
- Well, I started piecing it
together a little bit,

10:42.293 --> 10:44.252
but of course I didn't have
anything clear and,

10:44.295 --> 10:47.603
you know--until she actually
came out and shared it.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.475
- Scarlett from Las Vegas said,
"Erika, were you drunk

10:50.519 --> 10:52.216
"when you posted
about Tom's mistress

10:52.260 --> 10:53.565
on Instagram?
What were you thinking?"

10:53.609 --> 10:55.437
- No I was--I was angry.
- You were angry.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.091
- I was angry.
And I'll tell you why,

10:57.134 --> 10:58.875
because everyone was saying,

10:58.919 --> 11:00.790
<i>"Erika has this money."
- It's a sham.</i>

11:00.834 --> 11:02.270
<i>- Yeah.
- "The divorce is a shame."</i>

11:02.313 --> 11:05.142
"This is a thing for the two
of them to hide assets."

11:05.186 --> 11:07.405
I was like, mother----er
no, it's not.

11:07.449 --> 11:10.191
As a matter of fact,
this is what's going on.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.280
- I get the anger.
- Anger.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.542
- I get it.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.239
- Dina from Philadelphia said,
"Erika,

11:15.283 --> 11:18.025
"I clicked on the auction
for Tom's law firm.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.854
"Almost choked when I saw
those panties for sale.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.421
"Please explain to me
why there were lacy panties

11:23.465 --> 11:26.120
in your husband's desk drawer."
- Can I tell you something?

11:26.163 --> 11:28.426
That was the first time
I saw it too.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.863
They were definitely not mine.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.473
Who knows who he had bought
them for?

11:31.516 --> 11:33.127
But clearly...
- Oh, my God.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.303
- It was perhaps a Valentine's
Day setup, because...

11:35.346 --> 11:37.566
- I'm done.
- It was dated in January,

11:37.609 --> 11:40.308
<i>and then February
was the 14th.</i>

11:40.351 --> 11:42.179
Don't know. They weren't mind.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.443
- Erika, Lucille from Buffalo
said, "If you were kept away

11:45.487 --> 11:47.097
"from your own finances,

11:47.141 --> 11:49.317
"how were you able to close out
parts of your life

11:49.360 --> 11:53.147
and rent a house, lease a car,
and move without Tom knowing?"

11:53.190 --> 11:55.149
- Not able to answer
that question.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.282
But it was well
within legal bounds.

11:58.326 --> 12:01.503
I did nothing wrong, but I'm
not gonna answer that question.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.244
- June from Muncie, Indiana

12:03.287 --> 12:05.376
said, "I saw tabloid photos
of you

12:05.420 --> 12:08.510
"wearing your Cartier ring
boarding a private jet.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.948
Are you completely insensitive
or just clueless?"

12:11.992 --> 12:13.254
- Neither.

12:13.297 --> 12:16.387
I was invited on a trip,
and that's where I went.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.868
- Not at your--
- Not at my expense. No.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.044
- You did not pay for the jet.
- No.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.394
- Ladies, Millie
from Appleton, Wisconsin said,

12:23.438 --> 12:25.657
"At Erika's astrology party
last year,

12:25.701 --> 12:27.311
Tom wasn't missing a beat..."

12:27.355 --> 12:30.053
- Pat Wayne got me in a movie
in high school.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.359
- It was a Western.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.057
- So I got shot off the roof
and fell down.

12:34.101 --> 12:37.017
- Did you have a stunt double?
- No, it was all me.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.021
- You're a really
good storyteller.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.239
- I know!
- Isn't he?

12:42.283 --> 12:44.111
- Do you get it?
- Yeah. You get it, right?

12:44.154 --> 12:45.547
- Oh, I got it
from the moment--yes.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.418
- People always go--and I go...
- No.

12:47.462 --> 12:48.985
- "Just meet the man."
- Totally.

12:49.029 --> 12:52.380
- "And now he's in sudden
decline? How can that be?"

12:56.384 --> 12:58.516
- He's on a loop.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.736
Saying the same stories
over and over.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.564
- Okay.
- He's a master persuader

13:02.607 --> 13:04.044
and a master performer.

13:04.087 --> 13:07.090
He could not have told you
anyone's name here.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.483
Not a soul.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.615
But he certainly
could sit there and entertain.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.227
Will you please tell me
what your friend said?

13:13.270 --> 13:15.055
- Jen.
- Thank you.

13:15.098 --> 13:18.058
- Yeah, so, my friend watching
that episode said--and her mom

13:18.101 --> 13:19.755
has severe dementia now.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.193
And she said, "I'm telling you,
I'm seeing similarities in Tom

13:23.237 --> 13:26.022
as I do in my mom.
There's a vacancy I'm seeing."

13:26.066 --> 13:27.632
- Yes.
- And she said,

13:27.676 --> 13:29.547
"They can be like
that one moment--clear

13:29.591 --> 13:32.159
"and talking--and then
the next moment, nothing,

13:32.202 --> 13:33.638
"or, you know,
she gets confused

13:33.682 --> 13:35.075
about which child,
this and that."

13:35.118 --> 13:36.685
- Thank you.
- Hearing what she just said

13:36.728 --> 13:39.340
right now actually makes
so much sense,

13:39.383 --> 13:40.558
because that's what
he was doing.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.690
He was regaling us
with stories.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.822
- Yes.

13:42.865 --> 13:43.953
- And they were not
current stories.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.041
- Right.
- That he's told

13:45.085 --> 13:46.434
over and over again.
- Exactly.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.435
- And you could tell that
those stories he's told

13:47.478 --> 13:48.479
over and over.
Old stories.

13:48.523 --> 13:49.698
- Because that's
what he remembers.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.004
- That's right.
And they start to remember

13:51.047 --> 13:52.135
that--the older they get...
- The old stuff.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.267
- They start to remember
and tell...

13:53.310 --> 13:54.398
- They remember the old stuff.
- Yes!

13:54.442 --> 13:55.573
- The old stores.
- And they cannot tell you...

13:55.617 --> 13:57.184
- Because that's hat
my mom does.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.489
- What day it is today. Right.
- That's what Lois does.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.100
- Lois does.
She tells you the older things.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.449
- Yeah.
- And they're on a loop.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.712
- Yeah.
- Riley from Pittsburgh said,

14:03.755 --> 14:06.758
"Erika, you say Tom changed
after the accident

14:06.802 --> 14:08.499
"and displayed signs
of Alzheimer's.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.545
"If you didn't know
what he was doing,

14:10.588 --> 14:13.678
"why would you divorce him
when he was clearly sick?

14:13.722 --> 14:16.116
"He supported you for 20 years
and finally needed

14:16.159 --> 14:17.682
your support,
and you just left him."

14:17.726 --> 14:19.336
- That's not true.

14:19.380 --> 14:23.340
It is not fair to say
he got Alzheimer's and I split.

14:23.384 --> 14:28.476
The Alzheimer's and dementia
is a part of what was going on.

14:28.519 --> 14:33.133
Even in this accident that
people seem think--whatever--

14:33.176 --> 14:35.222
I was the one that found him.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.441
I was the one that took him
to the hospital.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.269
I was the one
that did not allow him

14:39.313 --> 14:40.618
to go under anesthesia

14:40.662 --> 14:42.707
after having been unconscious
for hours.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.840
I took a picture of the breaks.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.364
I sent them
to my dearest friend,

14:47.408 --> 14:48.888
who is an orthopedic surgeon,

14:48.931 --> 14:51.716
and I said, "Is this immediate?
Do we need to do this?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.631
"'Cause I don't want this man,
at this age,

14:53.675 --> 14:54.806
"with these head injuries,

14:54.850 --> 14:56.330
to go under anesthesia
right now."

14:56.373 --> 14:58.158
And he said, "No.
I'll fix it next week.

14:58.201 --> 15:03.076
Go home." I took him home.
I did everything I humanly,

15:03.119 --> 15:06.383
possibly could to do
right by him.

15:09.343 --> 15:12.215
Sorry. I don't--I'm not angry.
I'm angry.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.613
<i>- Coming up...
"Kyle, Dorit, Garcelle,</i>

15:18.656 --> 15:22.443
"and even Carlton have accused
you of talking over people.

15:22.486 --> 15:26.142
Do you ever think maybe the
problem is you and not Dorit?"

15:26.186 --> 15:28.318
- Finally.
- Who's Carlton?

15:28.362 --> 15:29.624
- Exactly.
- Well.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.720
- Sorry. I don't--
I'm not angry. I'm angry.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.417
- No, I'm actually happy
hearing these details,

15:40.461 --> 15:41.810
'cause we haven't
heard these details...

15:41.853 --> 15:43.333
- No, I know.
- Until right now.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.293
- I know. But this is what
has been happening.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.556
I protected that man. Okay?

15:48.599 --> 15:52.299
I reached out to many doctors,

15:52.342 --> 15:54.301
and I was blown off
more than once.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.998
One time, I was even told
by a physician,

15:56.042 --> 15:57.391
"I don't want to get involved,

15:57.434 --> 15:58.914
because I don't
want Tom to sue me."

15:58.958 --> 16:02.396
Okay, people still
feared this man.

16:02.439 --> 16:03.963
- Sarah from Washington,
Illinois said,

16:04.006 --> 16:05.790
"Erika, how can you be hurt
Tom said

16:05.834 --> 16:08.445
"someone could have you
if they could afford you?

16:08.489 --> 16:09.969
"You literally have
a song called

16:10.012 --> 16:11.579
'It's Expensive to Be Me.'"

16:11.622 --> 16:13.885
- Right. I don't think
we should dig in too much

16:13.929 --> 16:16.453
to an over-the-top, campy,
dance song.

16:16.497 --> 16:19.543
Let's not over-analyze it.
It was a fun piece.

16:19.587 --> 16:23.199
I'm not Bob Dylan over here
giving--you know.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.505
I'm entertaining, baby.

16:24.548 --> 16:25.985
- Okay.
It's--that's--it's established.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.638
- It's not that deep, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

16:27.682 --> 16:31.338
Rosario from Galveston said,
"Erika, you married a man

16:31.381 --> 16:33.993
"who funded a very expensive
performing career,

16:34.036 --> 16:37.866
"a career you've always wanted.
Knowing what you know now,

16:37.909 --> 16:40.695
would you have still
married Tom?"

16:46.744 --> 16:48.877
I'm at a place where I don't
quite know

16:48.920 --> 16:50.357
who I was married to.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.880
- Wow.

16:51.923 --> 16:54.665
- Because there are good parts
and there are bad parts.

16:54.709 --> 16:58.060
And I'm trying to--much
like everyone else around me,

16:58.104 --> 17:02.847
trying to figure out
what the happened.

17:02.891 --> 17:06.025
In the law firm
and in my personal life

17:06.068 --> 17:07.722
and the things
that I'm finding out,

17:07.765 --> 17:09.941
there are moments
I am overwhelmed,

17:09.985 --> 17:14.990
I am sad, I am heartbroken,
and then I am bewildered,

17:15.034 --> 17:19.560
truly, where I'm like,
what was real? How about that?

17:19.603 --> 17:22.911
- Do you think Tom loved you?
- I do. I do.

17:22.954 --> 17:27.916
I think he loved me, and then
I think things happened...

17:27.959 --> 17:30.745
- What happened?
- To him. I think he changed.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.922
I think we all change,
like marriages change.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.793
- Did you love him?
- I did.

17:35.837 --> 17:39.667
And I think you can see it.
You know?

17:39.710 --> 17:42.757
- I guess what
everybody's fixated on

17:42.800 --> 17:45.499
is whether he ripped off
all these people.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.676
- Right.
- And so, let's fixate on that

17:48.719 --> 17:52.941
for a minute.
And tell me where you put that,

17:52.984 --> 17:55.683
in terms of your feelings
for him.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.990
- I really and truly hope
that is not true,

17:59.034 --> 18:00.905
because that is not
the man that I married.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.124
- Do you think there's a chance

18:02.168 --> 18:03.778
that it is not true?
- Yes.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.606
- It doesn't look good.
- It does not looking good.

18:05.649 --> 18:09.349
However, we still need
to get to the bottom of it.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.960
Only one side of the story
has been told.

18:12.003 --> 18:16.095
- When you look and you read
about the allegations

18:16.138 --> 18:18.706
that are being made about him,
your name is in there.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.011
- Yes.
- All over the place.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.317
- Yes.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.537
- What do you want people
to know

18:23.580 --> 18:26.583
about your emotions
relating to that?

18:26.627 --> 18:30.631
- I feel terrible.
This is not who I am.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.590
And I hope
this is not who he is.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.505
- You still believe
that that could be--

18:35.549 --> 18:39.335
- No. I said I hope that is--
this has not happened.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.859
I hope that he has not done
what is alleged here.

18:43.513 --> 18:48.083
I am sitting here trying to,
A, number one,

18:48.127 --> 18:52.566
gather all of the information,
and fight my way out of it.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.089
And that's all I can do.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.178
- Sutton didn't even know
she owned a baseball team.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.788
- No.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.530
- That's right.
But that's what divorce does.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.011
- Yes. It reveals the ugly part

19:03.054 --> 19:05.927
of--or the hidden part
of our partners.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.016
- That's what I was talking
about with forensic...

19:08.059 --> 19:10.192
- Accounting.
- Accounting.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
- I am one of many.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.632
If I could show you my DMs
of women that have reached out

19:15.676 --> 19:18.592
to me that say--been
in similar situations,

19:18.635 --> 19:22.204
married to a businessman--you
know, some lady found--like,

19:22.248 --> 19:24.772
she owned, you know,
multiple homes.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.730
I mean, you know,
so, it happens.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.820
And that's, I think, also hard
for people to understand.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.648
You know, if you've never
seen it, then you go,

19:31.692 --> 19:32.997
"Well, how could you not know?

19:33.041 --> 19:34.521
- Well, I think it becomes
more difficult

19:34.564 --> 19:37.524
for people to understand
when it's allegedly

19:37.567 --> 19:38.699
other people's money...
- Right.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.179
- That's part of the equation.
- Exactly.

19:40.222 --> 19:43.530
And what's the bankruptcy
trustee is getting down to.

19:43.573 --> 19:46.576
You know, they've got
to sort out what money

19:46.620 --> 19:49.710
was supposed to go where.
- Wow.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.799
- And at this point,
quite honestly,

19:51.842 --> 19:53.888
I have to worry about myself.

19:53.931 --> 19:57.631
Whatever Tom Girardi did
or did not do, that's on him.

19:57.674 --> 20:00.721
But I know that a lot
of his decision-making

20:00.764 --> 20:02.592
is being pointing this way now.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.552
- Yes.
- His life is over.

20:05.595 --> 20:08.163
He's in his 80s.
He's in a memory care facility.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.905
His career is over and done.
I just turned 50.

20:10.948 --> 20:15.257
I cannot allow all of this
to destroy me

20:15.301 --> 20:17.172
and take me to a place
that I cannot recover.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.130
I have to survive this.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.004
So, that's why I'm feisty.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.880
Sorry. Hold on.
Give me that tissue.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.883
But that's--that's why.

20:35.669 --> 20:39.150
- All right. Well, we're gonna
get into more of what happened

20:39.194 --> 20:41.109
after you left Tom
in a little bit.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.284
- Okay.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.765
- We're gonna be
right back after this.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.078
- Welcome back.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.298
Crystal, your housekeeper Lucy

20:56.342 --> 20:58.648
has made an impression.
- Yes.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.302
- She's the ultimate
fashion police.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.696
- Do you like this?

21:02.739 --> 21:04.611
- Lucy, it's not ugly.
- What you think of this one?

21:04.654 --> 21:05.916
Ugh!

21:05.960 --> 21:08.310
- How did she feel
about your reunion look?

21:08.354 --> 21:10.094
- I didn't show it to her,

21:10.138 --> 21:11.835
'cause she probably would have
said something insulting.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.315
And I just didn't want
to think about it.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.708
- Oh, no!
- No, I'm kidding.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.100
- Right.
- I love her.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.407
- Dorit, Kaitlyn
from Gresham, Oregon

21:18.451 --> 21:20.975
thinks your wedding dress
designs are stunning.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.325
But who can afford
a $30,000 wedding dress?

21:23.369 --> 21:25.371
- This is, like, one of
our most expensive dresses.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.286
I want to say like $35,000.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.375
- $35,000?

21:29.418 --> 21:31.159
- First of all,
it's a luxury brand.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.900
That just happened to be
the jewel of the collection.

21:32.943 --> 21:36.991
Most of the dresses are about,
you know, $6,000 to $8,000.

21:37.034 --> 21:41.169
- Well, Dorit, you certainly
have a gift--a gift of gab.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.345
And it's a gift
that keeps on giving...

21:43.389 --> 21:44.781
- Yep.
- And giving and giving.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.087
- And I'm proud of it.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.959
- I could go on, and frankly,
so could she.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.961
So let's just roll the package.
-

21:51.005 --> 21:52.354
- All right, let's go
around the table.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.008
Oh!
- Let's go around,

21:54.051 --> 21:56.924
and one word that you think
of yourself. Go.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.796
- I'm hard-working.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.059
- Dorit, you forgot talkative.

22:02.103 --> 22:06.020
- You tend to hijack the moment
and just go on and on and on.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.805
And I have a problem when you
won't let anybody else speak.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.720
- Normally it takes people
a couple steps

22:10.764 --> 22:12.940
to get to their point,
but Dorit, it's a car,

22:12.983 --> 22:15.769
it's a train, it's a plane,
it's a connecting flight.

22:15.812 --> 22:18.859
- Do I need to be
directly, like, Dorit?

22:18.902 --> 22:19.990
- Direct? Yeah.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.296
- Probably.
- With her?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.733
- My God, will you shut up?

22:23.777 --> 22:25.822
<i>- Sispann pale.</i> Stop talking.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.084
Why am I looking at you, Dorit?

22:27.128 --> 22:29.391
- Yell, well--
how many languages

22:29.435 --> 22:31.175
do you want to tell me
to shut up in?

22:34.048 --> 22:36.311
- You take a lot of crap.
- I take a lot of crap,

22:36.355 --> 22:38.008
and I've taken
a lot of crap for years.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.402
I think I'm an easy target.
Yes.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.925
- Why?
- I do--I am longwinded.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.362
- Right. Okay.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.407
- But I don't feel like
I hijack conversations.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.932
People would say that I give
a lot of detail, and I do.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.281
- Got it.
- But you know,

22:50.325 --> 22:52.109
I'm a very
detail-oriented person.

22:52.153 --> 22:56.897
- Did anything that you saw
about your talking upset you?

22:56.940 --> 22:59.116
- If it's not done
in a malicious way,

22:59.160 --> 23:01.292
I think you can do it.
And I like that.

23:01.336 --> 23:04.731
I like being able to have
that banter with my friends.

23:08.299 --> 23:09.779
Am I boring you?

23:09.823 --> 23:12.434
- I'm sorry.
I just swallowed a yawn.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.175
But you are not
boring me whatsoever.

23:14.218 --> 23:15.742
- You're never boring, honey.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.875
- Kyle, Noelle from Syracuse
said, "Dorit, Garcelle,

23:18.919 --> 23:23.097
"and even Carlton have accused
you of talking over people.

23:23.140 --> 23:26.405
Do you ever think maybe the
problem is you and not Dorit?"

23:26.448 --> 23:28.450
- Finally. Voice of reason.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.060
- Who's Carlton?

23:30.104 --> 23:31.845
- Exactly. Anyway.
- Well.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.368
- When they--
when the tabloids--

23:33.412 --> 23:34.456
- Yes, but I'm sorry when I--
- Hold on, let me talk.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.675
Let me talk...
- No, I won't.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.154
- For one second.
- No, and don't you dare

23:37.198 --> 23:39.418
command me, you don't ----ing
dare command me.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.898
- Those are completely
different scenarios

23:41.942 --> 23:44.988
and situations,
so you cannot compare the two.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.860
- Jordan from Idaho said,

23:46.903 --> 23:48.165
"Crystal, you were
in the middle of Dorit

23:48.209 --> 23:49.776
and Kyle's argument
on the plane."

23:57.566 --> 23:59.307
- "Who was in the wrong?"

24:01.614 --> 24:04.138
- Yeah, Crystal.
-

24:04.181 --> 24:05.444
- Why are you, like--like,

24:05.487 --> 24:07.271
turning to me
very aggressively right now?

24:07.315 --> 24:08.490
- Dorit's like,
"If you don't side with me,

24:08.534 --> 24:09.883
you're gonna get it."

24:09.926 --> 24:11.101
- They fight truly
like sisters.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.538
And they make up like sisters.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.931
So I'm just gonna--I'm gonna
call it an even...

24:14.975 --> 24:17.368
- Garcelle, what do you think?
- I'm gonna have to say Dorit,

24:17.412 --> 24:20.067
because we were just talking
about how Dorit is longwinded.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.895
- Wesley from
Stowe, Vermont said,

24:21.938 --> 24:24.245
"Dorit, you put your foot
in your mouth when you said

24:24.288 --> 24:26.900
it isn't just brown people
who work for you."

24:26.943 --> 24:28.510
- We've had a lot of people
that work for us

24:28.554 --> 24:30.469
that are very multi-cultural.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.384
I've had a lot of Black
and Hispanic and Filipino.

24:33.428 --> 24:36.257
And my kids are used to it.
I mean, some of the people

24:36.300 --> 24:40.130
they've loved most
in this world are dark-skinned.

24:40.174 --> 24:43.003
- Didn't you realize how wrong
it was to say that?

24:43.046 --> 24:47.355
- You know, I was answering a
direct question from Garcelle.

24:47.398 --> 24:50.532
And sometimes
I use words poorly.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.012
This was one
of those instances.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.927
And I wish I could
have taken in back.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.495
But I don't take back
the sentiment and what I meant,

24:56.538 --> 24:59.106
which is I was raised
with a lot of diversity.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.629
I'm raising my kids
the same way.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.849
And it's not just people
that work for us,

25:02.892 --> 25:05.895
it's also very,
very close family friends

25:05.939 --> 25:08.158
that I've known way
before I had kids.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.551
- Ketoiskaren tweeted,

25:09.595 --> 25:12.162
"What Garcelle asked went
right over Dorit's head.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.600
"She didn't ask if you
only staffed brown people,

25:14.643 --> 25:17.298
"she asked if the only brown
folk you and your family know

25:17.341 --> 25:20.519
"are the ones who have
to clean after y'all.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.522
Garcelle, is this an example
of Dorit not listening?"

25:23.565 --> 25:27.656
- No, that night it was
a tough conversation to have.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.440
It was uncomfortable for me.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.530
I'm sure it was uncomfortable
for these ladies.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.183
And I didn't know
how you took...

25:33.227 --> 25:35.403
- That's how you make progress.
- What I said.

25:35.446 --> 25:38.406
- I liked what you said,
because you explained

25:38.449 --> 25:40.190
and taught me something
I didn't know.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.018
You know, Michael Jackson
and I grew up together,

25:42.062 --> 25:45.065
and Michael said to me,
"Kathy, I don't see color."

25:45.108 --> 25:47.371
I said, well, "Either do we."

25:47.415 --> 25:49.069
- I know you can see me
as a woman.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.897
You can see me as a mother.
You can see me as a friend.

25:50.940 --> 25:54.291
But if you don't see color,
then you don't see me.

25:54.335 --> 25:56.119
- Sharing information--I think
it's beautiful.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.686
- I do too.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.384
Everybody on social media takes
everything so seriously...

26:00.428 --> 26:01.516
- Right.
- All the time.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.257
And we were having
a conversation,

26:03.300 --> 26:04.650
and we were
sort of dissecting--

26:04.693 --> 26:07.043
- Educational, I think.
- It was very educational.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.262
And it was really great.

26:08.305 --> 26:09.916
And I love this aspect
of the show,

26:09.959 --> 26:12.571
that we've been able
to have these conversations.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.485
- We've been able to do it.
Nobody else has.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.139
- But it was a tough
conversation.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.924
It was an uncomfortable
conversation.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.578
It really was.

26:19.621 --> 26:23.407
- Bria from Woodstock said,
"Tell us straight--is your nose

26:23.451 --> 26:25.975
as original as the vintage Dior
in your closet?"

26:26.019 --> 26:29.239
- You know, I really,
really want to make this point

26:29.283 --> 26:30.676
and get this straight,

26:30.719 --> 26:34.070
because this actually
really hurt me.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.595
I went to the nose doctor
with Kyle.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.727
- She went with me
for my consultation as well,

26:38.771 --> 26:40.511
and he gave her
an impromptu one.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.209
- Let's look at your nose
carefully.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.341
Do you think it's wide
from the front?

26:44.385 --> 26:46.082
- Well, now it
looks really wide.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.431
- Okay. I agree with you.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.390
-
- Tip is a bit wide.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.131
Now smile for me real big.

26:51.174 --> 26:53.960
See how your nose droops and
you get a small hump there?

26:54.003 --> 26:56.353
- See how you look like
your grandmother's nose?

26:56.397 --> 26:59.182
- I've never had one,
hand to God.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.663
And I would say
if I had a nose job.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.622
I don't know why I have
to constantly prove it.

27:03.665 --> 27:07.016
But I don't like
the insinuation that I'm lying

27:07.060 --> 27:09.453
or that
I'm not--I genuinely haven't.

27:09.497 --> 27:11.630
- Brittany from Wilton,
Connecticut said, "Garcelle,

27:11.673 --> 27:13.109
"do you think
the Dorit goldfish

27:13.153 --> 27:15.677
talked the Kyle goldfish
to death, literally?"

27:15.721 --> 27:16.983
- Oh!

27:17.026 --> 27:19.289
The black and white one
is Dorit,

27:19.333 --> 27:21.465
because look at her.
Fabulous.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.206
Regular goldfish is Kyle.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.773
- Oh, sh--.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.470
- Oh, Lord.

27:26.514 --> 27:27.733
- We are gonna leave it there.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.473
We're gonna be
right back after this.

27:29.517 --> 27:30.692
<i>Next...</i>

27:30.736 --> 27:33.086
Rinna, I get why
you didn't like the idea

27:33.129 --> 27:34.391
of Amelia dating Scott.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.177
<i>Did you push her
towards that decision?</i>

27:37.220 --> 27:39.440
- You know,
I'm so ----ing shady.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.183
- Can't control the mouth.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.712
- Stand by, everyone; let's
make sure everybody's in place.

27:50.756 --> 27:51.844
And queue Andy.

27:53.541 --> 27:54.890
- Welcome back

27:54.934 --> 27:58.415
to the "Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" Reunion.

27:58.459 --> 28:01.592
Lisa, it was so fun seeing you
and Eileen Davidson

28:01.636 --> 28:03.507
in "Beyond Salem" on Peacock.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.729
- You shut your damn mouth.

28:07.773 --> 28:10.340
I've had about enough of you,
you beast!

28:13.169 --> 28:16.259
- Beast? How dare you!

28:16.303 --> 28:18.305
- You know, they kept
all the good parts out of it.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.220
They didn't have
the "beast" line in.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.265
- Just shut your ----ing mouth.
- Excuse me.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.614
- I've had enough of you,
you beast.

28:23.658 --> 28:24.790
- Beast?
- Yes.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.617
- How dare you!

28:26.661 --> 28:29.142
- And Eileen and I were like,
"You have to say 'beast.'"

28:29.185 --> 28:30.534
- Right.
- "We have to say these words."

28:30.578 --> 28:32.841
Anyway, it all came together,
and it was a blast.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.887
We had so much fun.
- It's really fun.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.627
Well, when the world
slowed down,

28:36.671 --> 28:39.543
so did Lisa
and Hamlin household.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.371
And while Harry's gardening
and cooking

28:41.415 --> 28:45.680
were nothing if not heavenly,
it was Amelia's relationship

28:45.724 --> 28:49.292
that had everyone saying,
"Oh, Lord."

28:49.336 --> 28:50.685
- Here we go.
- Let's watch.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.165
- Here we go.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.472
Harry?
- I'm down here.

28:55.516 --> 28:58.737
- Oh, look at your garden.
Hey, we have a pumpkin!

28:58.780 --> 29:03.480
I have definitely formed
a stronger dependency on Harry

29:03.524 --> 29:05.482
during these last ten months.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.789
- These are haricot verts,
the French beans.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.357
- I love these.
- Tomatoes look done.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.750
- Is this your compost thing?

29:11.793 --> 29:13.447
- That's my compost thing,
yeah.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.318
- Do you put poop in there?

29:15.362 --> 29:17.538
- No.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.496
- I cannot imagine
what Harry Hamlin sees in me.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.802
I really can't.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.849
- Pick up the nozzle
and run back here with it.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.328
All this has to happen
in one minute.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.721
- I know. I know.
- Good for you.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.244
- Ah!
- Good for you.

29:28.288 --> 29:30.246
- I did it on my first try!
- All right.

29:30.290 --> 29:33.336
- But I do know how to give
a damn good blow job.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.339
Whoo!

29:36.383 --> 29:38.428
I handle his hose quite well.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.822
Harry is the domestic one.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.432
- This is so pretty.
- So welcome to Positano.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.520
- Wow!
- Wow!

29:43.564 --> 29:45.827
<i>- Que bello!
- This is gorgeous!</i>

29:45.871 --> 29:47.394
Did you set this?

29:47.437 --> 29:48.961
Or did Lisa set this?
I need to know these things.

29:49.004 --> 29:50.701
- She did nothing.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.312
- It would be very different
in my house, let me tell you.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.530
- My husband would never know
how to do this.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.837
- I--never, in a million years.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.405
- We need to take Dad
to dinner somewhere.

29:58.448 --> 29:59.754
<i>- Okay.</i>

30:04.411 --> 30:06.717
- We can talk
about my daughter,

30:06.761 --> 30:09.851
who is linked to a guy
named Scott Disick.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.811
And I was like, okay, come on.
Right? Like, come on.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.856
Okay. Like, why can't it be
Harry Styles?

30:14.900 --> 30:17.772
Why the
is it Scott Disick?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.513
- He's too damn old!
- I know!

30:19.556 --> 30:21.515
- He's old.
- And he's got three kids.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.038
<i>- Would I be freaked out
if I had a daughter</i>

30:23.082 --> 30:25.301
that was dating an older man?
No, I was the daughter

30:25.345 --> 30:27.826
that was dating an older man
all my life, so no.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.480
- Amelia's 19. That's how old
I was when I had my first.

30:30.524 --> 30:31.742
Can you imagine?
So, just so you know.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.570
- Oh! The terror.
-

30:35.094 --> 30:38.010
-
- No, no, no, no. No. No.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.360
- No, ma'am.
- He's like, "Don't even play."

30:40.403 --> 30:41.796
- Bill from Manhattan

30:41.840 --> 30:43.885
wants to know
why they called it quits

30:43.929 --> 30:46.932
and who pushed
the eject button first?

30:46.975 --> 30:50.718
- I think you just have to read
the press, and Amelia did.

30:53.373 --> 30:56.811
- Can't control the mouth.
- Were you glad she did?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.465
- Yes.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.815
- Did you push her
towards that decision,

31:00.859 --> 31:04.036
or did she make it
all on her own?

31:04.079 --> 31:05.994
- She made it all on her own.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.910
- The news reports are that
it had to do

31:08.954 --> 31:13.654
with the whole DM exchange
that Scott got in.

31:13.697 --> 31:15.351
- Well, I don't think
that was helpful.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.658
- Right.
- There's never one reason why,

31:17.701 --> 31:19.399
I think, people split up.

31:19.442 --> 31:20.748
You know,
now's the time to heal.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.793
Now's the time
for everyone to heal.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.795
- Including yourself.
- Well, yeah.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.450
- And you began healing
by posting a picture

31:27.494 --> 31:29.670
of Harry Styles
on your Instagram.

31:29.713 --> 31:32.107
- You know,
I'm so ----ing shady.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.936
I love Harry Styles.
You know that.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.416
I mean, I was already posting

31:36.459 --> 31:38.635
Harry many times,
if you follow me.

31:38.679 --> 31:39.898
- I hear he's a fan
of the show.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.725
He is.
- He loves the show.

31:41.769 --> 31:45.991
- He actually asked some of us
for a birthday video.

31:46.034 --> 31:49.037
- Hearing that you have been
self-quarantined

31:49.081 --> 31:50.517
and binge-watching

31:50.560 --> 31:51.953
"Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"

31:51.997 --> 31:54.564
is just about the best news
I've gotten all month.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.829
- Ah! He loves the show.
- Wow.

31:58.873 --> 32:03.008
What was Amelia's reaction
to seeing you kind of

32:03.051 --> 32:05.880
bashing the relationship
or him on the show?

32:05.924 --> 32:07.926
- Well, I let them know that.
You know, I mean, I was--

32:07.969 --> 32:09.492
- You did.
- Of course. I warned

32:09.536 --> 32:11.712
everybody--I mean, listen,
people are still human,

32:11.755 --> 32:13.844
and I think it still hurts
people's feelings

32:13.888 --> 32:17.022
when you say something
that isn't necessarily...

32:17.065 --> 32:18.849
- Flattering.
- You know, flattering. So.

32:18.893 --> 32:21.069
- Do you think your doing that
played into their relationship

32:21.113 --> 32:22.679
at all in a negative way?
- No.

32:22.723 --> 32:25.595
No. I don't think so.
I don't.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.511
- How did you ladies feel
about the breakup?

32:28.555 --> 32:30.383
- Good.
-

32:30.426 --> 32:31.688
- Relieved.
- Yeah.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.517
- No, I mean,
I want everyone to be happy.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.736
But you know how I felt
from the beginning.

32:35.779 --> 32:36.737
- You want your kids
to be happy.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.868
- Right.
- There was too much

32:37.912 --> 32:39.392
of an age gap.
- Crystal, you and Rob

32:39.435 --> 32:40.654
have a 20-year age gap.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.047
Did your parents approve?

32:42.090 --> 32:43.874
- Well, my parents
were 23 years apart.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.093
- Oh, great!

32:45.137 --> 32:47.791
<i>- Yeah, so it was no issue
on their part.</i>

32:47.835 --> 32:49.402
- Kendall from Lansing,
Michigan said,

32:49.445 --> 32:51.491
"Rinna, I get why
you didn't like the idea

32:51.534 --> 32:52.883
"of Amelia dating Scott.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.755
"But when you actually
met the guy,

32:54.798 --> 32:57.714
is that when you started
to really hate the idea?"

32:57.758 --> 33:00.543
- No.
Actually, he was very nice.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.415
When we met him,
he was very nice.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.983
- How many times did you
all hang out?

33:05.026 --> 33:08.551
- I would say three times.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.684
- You would say three times.
- Yeah.

33:10.727 --> 33:11.946
Well, I mean,
it was three times,

33:11.990 --> 33:13.817
but I'm saying yeah,
three times.

33:13.861 --> 33:16.124
- Sean from Oakland said,

33:16.168 --> 33:18.561
"Kyle, you're close friends
with Kris Jenner.

33:18.605 --> 33:22.000
"Did you get in trouble

33:22.043 --> 33:23.827
"when you shared
your negative opinions

33:23.871 --> 33:25.916
about Scott dating Amelia?"

33:25.960 --> 33:27.831
- They never said anything
about it.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.616
I did feel about it
right after,

33:29.659 --> 33:32.619
because, you know,
I do know all of them.

33:32.662 --> 33:35.535
But, I mean, Amelia's 20,
and I'm a mom of daughters.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.886
So, I wouldn't approve
if I were in Lisa's shoes,

33:38.929 --> 33:40.757
but I knew that she had
no control over that. So.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.281
- Yeah.
- All right.

33:42.324 --> 33:45.588
It must have been hard not
seeing Lois for all of COVID.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.155
Have you seen her yet?
- I have.

33:47.199 --> 33:50.202
Amelia and I went up and
celebrated her 93rd birthday...

33:50.245 --> 33:51.725
- Wow.
- In June.

"Rinna, why do you think Drake
follows you on Instagram...?"

34:05.217 --> 34:06.696
- [BLEEP], I have no idea.

34:06.740 --> 34:07.958
- "But not the rest
of the women?"

34:08.002 --> 34:09.525
- I really have no clue.

34:09.569 --> 34:10.961
I didn't know
Drake followed me.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.833
His name is, like,
Champagne Pappy or something.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.791
- That's Champagne Papi.
I follow Champagne Papi.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.967
- How would you know who
the Champagne Pappy is?

34:17.011 --> 34:18.621

- Oh.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.545
You know who really thrilled me
recently is Florence Pugh.

34:29.589 --> 34:30.981
Is that how you say
her last name?

- Yeah.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.506
- The movie star?
- Yeah.

34:33.549 --> 34:34.942
- I think that's what's
so great about Instagram,

34:34.985 --> 34:36.117
is you get to talk to people

34:36.161 --> 34:37.597
that you would never get
to talk to.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.033

34:39.077 --> 34:41.644

It's exciting.

doesn't follow me.

reactions to Harry Hamlin...

in my garden all night long."

"he entertains, he listens.
Lisa, what else do you

35:08.280 --> 35:11.674

35:11.718 --> 35:13.676
- Oh, damn.
-

35:13.720 --> 35:15.156
- You know, Harry says
this one thing--

35:15.200 --> 35:16.810
and it'll make everybody
laugh--but he says

35:16.853 --> 35:19.291
that I am the smartest person
he's ever met.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.857

that's so amazing...

35:23.860 --> 35:25.558
- 'Cause wouldn't necessarily
think that about me.

35:25.601 --> 35:27.690
So, having Harry Hamlin say
that--I always love that.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.736
- Well, and he knows
you better than anybody. So.

35:29.779 --> 35:30.911
- We love Harry.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.782
- Garcelle, Abigail
from Tulsa said,

35:32.826 --> 35:35.742
"It was so sweet of Harry
to make you extra sauce."

35:35.785 --> 35:38.179
Would you rather be friends
with Harry than Lisa?"

35:38.223 --> 35:39.615
- Oh, my God.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.791
- I've loved Harry
for a very long time.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.317
- So, there's your answer.
- Harry!

35:45.360 --> 35:47.884
- I have something for you.
- You have something for me?

35:47.928 --> 35:49.625
- It's a bunny. No, kidding.
- Is it a bunny?

35:49.669 --> 35:51.584
You brought me sauce?
Are you kidding me?

35:51.627 --> 35:53.325
- This is Harry Hamlin's sauce
that he made

35:53.368 --> 35:57.024
before he went to Canada.
It's tomatoes from his garden.

35:57.067 --> 35:58.634
- Wow!

35:58.678 --> 36:01.246
- Make sure when you eat it
you send a text the next day.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.944
- I was about to say.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.338
You gotta text him
right this second.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.602
I'd do it right now.
Stop what you're doing.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.691
- That is funny.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.606
All right, thank you,
Harry, for the sauce.

36:13.649 --> 36:16.043
And we are gonna take a break.
We'll be right back.

36:16.086 --> 36:18.132
Wow, I'm so excited about that.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.917
I gotta figure out
how I'm gonna get that home.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.833
<i>Coming up...</i>

36:23.877 --> 36:25.270
- It's really hard for Kathy

36:25.313 --> 36:28.795
to talk about anything
to do with our mom.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.755
It's okay. It's okay.
- Aww.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.109
- We are back with more

36:39.153 --> 36:41.242
of the "Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" Reunion.

36:41.286 --> 36:44.158
Well, for years,
Kyle and Kathy's relationship

36:44.202 --> 36:48.162
was in need of a revival.
But now that they're back,

36:48.206 --> 36:51.426
can this sister act keep
from getting canceled again?

36:51.470 --> 36:52.862
Let's watch.

36:54.299 --> 36:57.302
- Doogie knows her stuff.
-

36:57.345 --> 36:59.956
<i>I have no idea
why my sisters call me Doogie.</i>

37:00.000 --> 37:01.915
Now that I think about it,
it's a little suspicious.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.876
- A Doogie. Little child.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.791
<i>It's a love name.</i>

37:08.835 --> 37:11.141
Like a little Tootsie Roll.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.102
I don't want onions in lasagna.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.887
- I'm famous for
my lasagna, okay?

37:17.931 --> 37:19.367
- How come I've never had it?

37:19.411 --> 37:23.458
- Because you weren't talking
to me for too many years.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.982
<i>Joking like this with Kathy,
it really does make me think</i>

37:26.026 --> 37:27.897
about all the times
we missed together.

37:27.941 --> 37:30.900
- How is your relationship
with Kathy right now?

37:30.944 --> 37:32.554
- Um, not great.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.077
- Are you speaking?

37:34.121 --> 37:35.949
- Not right now.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.864
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:37.907 --> 37:41.389
- We've been under scrutiny
for so many years,

37:41.433 --> 37:46.089
and what happens is
it's only drawing attention.

37:46.133 --> 37:51.269
- My sister and I had a lot of
setbacks in our relationship.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.966
<i>And then I did
"American Woman,"</i>

37:53.009 --> 37:54.576
<i>and I think Kathy thought</i>

37:54.620 --> 37:58.145
that I was going to disrespect
our mother or my sisters.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.321
I did a deal
with Warner Brothers

38:00.365 --> 38:03.324
for a scripted TV show
about my life growing up.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.109
- How has your family reacted?
Did they say well done?

38:06.153 --> 38:08.111
- Uh, not yet.

38:08.155 --> 38:11.158
Anytime there was
a conversation to bring

38:11.201 --> 38:15.118
the family together again,
it just never went well.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.338
My family celebrates Christmas.
- Right.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.905
- But I'm not always
invited now.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.560
It's not like it was before.
We did everything together.

38:21.603 --> 38:23.301
Talked every single day,
ten times a day.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.954
It's not like that.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.565
It was a very hard time.

38:27.217 --> 38:30.308
I feel like
it caused so much pain

38:30.351 --> 38:32.092
and heartache in the family,

38:32.135 --> 38:35.922
and none of us ever want
to feel that pain again.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.402
These remind me of
when we were little.

38:37.445 --> 38:40.318
- Remember Mom would make
that--the tomato soup,

38:40.361 --> 38:41.623
out of the can?

38:41.667 --> 38:43.451
- She really was not
a good cook.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.410
- This is what
she doesn't like.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.194
- What, the talking about that?

38:51.938 --> 38:53.592
- Being together.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.298
- Mom was so funny
with her cooking.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.001
You know?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.620
- Aw.
- Such a waste.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.491
- What a waste.

39:23.535 --> 39:26.146
Aw.
-

39:26.189 --> 39:29.410
Snuggle me, Doogie.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.066
- That's amazing.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.677
- Aww.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.941
- It's nice that there's
a happy ending here.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.421
Right?
Yep.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.380
- Kathy, what's your reaction
when you see

39:42.423 --> 39:44.425
some of that old footage
of Kyle

39:44.469 --> 39:46.514
talking about
being estranged from you?

39:46.558 --> 39:49.038
- It's-it's very sad,
because it's--first time

39:49.082 --> 39:53.173
I ever saw it was
when I saw that episode.

39:53.216 --> 39:56.394
- I have to assume
you were not happy

39:56.437 --> 39:59.440
when the first season aired.
- No.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.268
- It upset you a lot
to see that limousine.

40:01.311 --> 40:02.530
You've said that.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.140
- After everything that
I have done for you,

40:04.184 --> 40:05.359
everything I've done

40:05.403 --> 40:06.621
for you--I'm always
there for you--

40:06.665 --> 40:08.057
- Everything you've done
for me?

40:08.101 --> 40:10.625
- Yeah.
- You stole my goddamn house!

40:10.669 --> 40:12.975
- You better ----ing
take that back right now.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.455
You better ----ing...

40:14.499 --> 40:15.587
- Stop it. Stop.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.197
- Right now.
- Stop it. Stop it.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.547
- You are a liar and,
second, an alcoholic.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.463
- Then you had Kim's issues...
- Don't.

40:22.507 --> 40:26.162
- With her sobriety
playing out on the show.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.034
- Right.
- And I again have to assume

40:28.077 --> 40:31.429
that that was very painful
for you, as it was for Kyle.

40:31.472 --> 40:35.258
- I kept thinking about my mom.
Like, what would my mom do?

40:35.302 --> 40:37.043
- Wow.
- And as the oldest sister,

40:37.086 --> 40:38.566
I feel like,

40:38.610 --> 40:40.481
Holy...

40:40.525 --> 40:41.961
- A responsibility.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.266
- Right.
- Yeah.

40:43.310 --> 40:45.225
And I understand
Erika a little bit,

40:45.268 --> 40:49.577
because I think there's a part
of me that was very much, like,

40:49.621 --> 40:52.188
holding things in like that.
Don't you think?

40:52.232 --> 40:53.581
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, you definitely did.

40:53.625 --> 40:56.541
- And when you can stand back
and look at yourself

40:56.584 --> 40:59.674
by having this
on the show like that,

40:59.718 --> 41:02.721
if it can help other people to,
like, pick up the phone

41:02.764 --> 41:06.551
or just be more vulnerable
and not waste time

41:06.594 --> 41:10.293
and a relationship--because
we did.

41:10.337 --> 41:12.078
We wasted a lot of time.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.472
- Thank God you're still here
to change that.

41:14.515 --> 41:15.690
- Right. Absolutely.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.519
- How many episodes
of "American Woman"

41:18.563 --> 41:21.043
did you wind up watching?
Or did you?

41:21.087 --> 41:23.263
- you know,
I watched a trailer.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.265
I don't watch TV much.

41:25.308 --> 41:28.486
- Given what an issue it was,
do you think maybe

41:28.529 --> 41:30.226
if you had watched it
you would have--

41:30.270 --> 41:32.533
that maybe would have
put that to bed a little bit?

41:32.577 --> 41:37.146
- No, because I don't even talk
to my mother's friends.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.365
- Interesting.

41:38.408 --> 41:40.541
- There's a tape of her
talking to us.

41:40.585 --> 41:45.154
I just--the fact that
she's not here anymore,

41:45.198 --> 41:46.765
it's just very hard for me.

42:02.258 --> 42:03.608
- It's okay.

42:04.391 --> 42:09.614
I do feel like it's really hard
for Kathy to

42:09.657 --> 42:14.053
talk about any of this--
anything to do with our mom.

42:15.837 --> 42:17.622
It's okay. It's okay.

42:19.449 --> 42:21.582
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

42:23.279 --> 42:24.542
It's okay.

42:28.589 --> 42:30.548
It's okay. It's okay.
- It's too hard for her.

42:30.591 --> 42:31.723
It's too hard.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.771
- It's okay.

42:53.396 --> 42:56.225
<i>- Next week,
the reunion continues.</i>

42:56.269 --> 42:58.663
How did you land a job
at an escort agency?

42:58.706 --> 43:00.882
- It was the summer between
high school and college.

43:00.926 --> 43:02.884
- Prime time to work
at an escort agency.

43:02.928 --> 43:05.670
- Right. Well, I was 18. So.
-

43:05.713 --> 43:08.629
- Who would trust Kathy
to cut your hair?

43:08.673 --> 43:09.978
- Oh, hell no!

43:10.022 --> 43:12.502
- What about to do dental work?
- Not dental.

43:12.546 --> 43:13.721
- That's where
you draw the line.

43:15.418 --> 43:16.855
- Do you stand by
your assertion

43:16.898 --> 43:20.162
that the leather pants--?
- They weren't my favorite.

43:20.206 --> 43:22.774
- What did Erika know?

43:22.817 --> 43:28.431
Did you have any sense this
alleged theft was happening?

43:28.475 --> 43:30.259
When the women
ask you questions,

43:30.303 --> 43:31.913
you lash out at them.
- Absolutely.

43:31.957 --> 43:34.350
I'm lashing out
at everyone, Andy.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.918
- You come off
as you're the victim.

43:36.962 --> 43:39.442
- You looked like
you were the victim.

43:39.486 --> 43:40.879
- Are you ----ing kidding me?

43:40.922 --> 43:43.795
- You found him after he was
unconscious for 12 hours?

43:43.838 --> 43:45.666
- Yes.
- Is there a police report?

43:45.710 --> 43:47.363
- They can't find one.

43:47.407 --> 43:49.191
- Where's your anger
towards him?

43:49.235 --> 43:50.584
- What do you want me to do?

43:50.628 --> 43:52.281
- You just bit Crystal's
head off and said--

43:52.325 --> 43:54.240
- She just told me
I wasn't angry enough.

43:54.283 --> 43:56.546
Am I angry now enough for you?

43:56.590 --> 43:57.896
You don't know
what I have done...

43:57.939 --> 43:59.462
- That's--
- Or what I will do.

43:59.506 --> 44:01.595
- That's true.
- What will you do?

44:01.639 --> 44:03.162
- You'll just have to wait
and see, won't you?
