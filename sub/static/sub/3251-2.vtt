WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.520
Bye then! Lovely meeting you,
sorry about the mess.

00:05.520 --> 00:11.040
You think I'll let you leave
without me,

00:11.040 --> 00:13.360
after what we've just been through?

00:13.360 --> 00:16.480
You've got the Egyptian people
to rule, Queen Nefertiti.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.800
They'll need reassuring
after that weapon-bearing

00:18.800 --> 00:21.720
giant alien locust attack we just
stopped, rather brilliantly.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.920
HOOTER SOUNDS
Sorry!

00:23.920 --> 00:27.320
Got it set to temporal newsfeed...
Oh, that's interesting!
What is? Nothing!

00:27.320 --> 00:30.400
Not at.. Ohh!
Never been there, exciting!

00:35.920 --> 00:38.880
Craft size approximately
ten million square kilometres.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.680
A ship the size of Canada,
coming at Earth very fast.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.880
Any signs of life?

00:43.880 --> 00:46.040
We sent up a drone craft,
it took these readings.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.960
Crikey Charlie, look at that!

00:48.960 --> 00:51.440
Ooh, I know someone who'd love
a look. And the Ponds!

00:51.440 --> 00:53.840
Mustn't forget the Ponds!
Haven't seen them in ages.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.200
I'm riffing, people usually stop me
when I'm riffing,
or carry on without me.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.360
Can you communicate with this craft?

00:59.360 --> 01:02.040
She's with me. Good question, Neffy.

01:02.040 --> 01:06.760
No. No response on any channel
in any recognised language.

01:06.760 --> 01:12.600
If it comes within 10,000 kilometres
of Earth, we send up missiles.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.360
Oh, Indira, I liked you
before you said missiles.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.000
How long till the ship gets
that close?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.080
Six hours, nineteen minutes.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.360
Right, better get a shift on then!
Leave it with us.
Come on then, Neffy!

01:23.360 --> 01:25.160
We're going to need help.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.160
More stew?

01:28.160 --> 01:31.680
Where have you been, man?!
Seven months! You were popping out
for some liquorice!

01:31.680 --> 01:34.280
I had two very disappointed
dancers on my hands!

01:34.280 --> 01:35.880
Not that I couldn't manage.

01:37.600 --> 01:42.560
Riddell, listen, I've found...
well, something.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.560
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I shan't fall for that again.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.120
What is it?

01:52.120 --> 01:54.160
I've no idea.
Do you want to find out?

01:59.400 --> 02:00.800
I think it's the fitting.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.960
Dad, it's not the fitting,
it just needs a new bulb.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.880
You're wobbling the ladder.
I'm not!

02:04.880 --> 02:06.600
I don't want another
loft incident.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.919
How's my side, Brian?
Perfect as ever, Amy.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.199
Thank you, Brian!

02:10.199 --> 02:13.440
I don't know what he said to you
to make you marry him,

02:13.440 --> 02:15.560
but he's a lucky man.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.480
METALLIC THRUMMING
Not here! Not now!

02:17.480 --> 02:20.040
Did you leave the back door open?
What is he doing?!

02:20.040 --> 02:21.320
I'm going to kill him!

02:23.040 --> 02:24.640
Hello!

02:24.640 --> 02:27.520
You weren't busy, were you?
Well, even if you were,

02:27.520 --> 02:29.960
it wasn't as interesting as
this probably is.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.800
Didn't want you to miss it.
Now, just a quick hop.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.400
Everybody grab a torch!

02:49.720 --> 02:51.720
Spiders.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.640
Don't normally get spiders in space.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.160
What the...?

02:57.160 --> 02:58.920
Don't move!

02:58.920 --> 03:01.920
D'you really think I'm that stupid
I wouldn't notice?

03:01.920 --> 03:03.920
How did you get aboard?
Transmat? Who sent you?

03:03.920 --> 03:05.120
Doctor... >

03:06.760 --> 03:09.480
..that's my dad.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.800
Well, frankly, that's outrageous.
What?

03:11.800 --> 03:15.160
You think you can bring
your dad along without asking?
I'm not a taxi service!

03:15.160 --> 03:17.600
You materialised around us!

03:17.600 --> 03:21.200
Oh, well, that's fine then,
my mistake.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.960
Hello, Brian, how are you?
Nice to meet you. Welcome, welcome!

03:24.960 --> 03:28.760
This is the gang.
I've got a gang - yes!
Come on then, everyone!

03:29.840 --> 03:33.160
Tell him something, quick.
Yes, thank you!

03:35.200 --> 03:37.800
I'm not entirely sure
what's going on.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.760
You know when Amy and I first got
married and we went travelling?

03:40.760 --> 03:43.840
To Thailand.
More the entirety of space and time.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.960
In that police box.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.160
LOUD THUDDING

03:52.800 --> 03:55.400
All right, where are we,
and what is that noise?

03:55.400 --> 03:56.440
And hello! Ten months!

03:56.440 --> 04:01.440
Orbiting Earth - well, I say
orbiting, more like pre-crashing
on a spaceship -

04:01.440 --> 04:04.000
don't know, and hello, Pond.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.280
Ten months, time flies.
Never really understood that phrase.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.680
This is Neffy, this is Riddell.
They're with me.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.440
With you? They're with you,
are they the new us?
Is that why we haven't seen you?

04:13.440 --> 04:15.400
No, they're just people.
They're not Ponds!

04:15.400 --> 04:20.040
I thought we might need a gang, not
really had a gang before, it's new.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.640
LIFT MECHANISM WHIRRS

04:27.000 --> 04:28.880
It's coming down.
What is it?

04:28.880 --> 04:31.320
No idea.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.240
CREATURES ROAR

04:42.760 --> 04:44.880
Not possible!

04:44.880 --> 04:46.720
Run!

04:49.440 --> 04:51.200
Doctor!

04:51.200 --> 04:56.560
I know! Dinosaurs! On a spaceship!

04:58.000 --> 05:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:33.960 --> 05:36.720
DINOSAURS ROAR

05:44.720 --> 05:46.200
In here!

05:53.360 --> 05:57.400
DINOSAURS ROAR AND CRASH

06:03.680 --> 06:07.200
(I could take one of them,
short blow, up into the throat.)

06:07.200 --> 06:09.520
(Or not. We've just found dinosaurs,
in space.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.840
(We need to preserve them.)

06:10.840 --> 06:13.160
(And who's going to preserve us?)
Sshh!

06:35.800 --> 06:39.800
OK, so, how? And whose ship?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.440
There's so much to discover,

06:41.440 --> 06:44.360
think how much wiser
we'll be by the end of all this.

06:44.360 --> 06:50.400
Sorry. Sorry. Are you saying
dinosaurs are flying a spaceship?

06:50.400 --> 06:52.600
Brian, please!
That would be ridiculous.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.880
They're probably just passengers.
Did I mention missiles? Missiles?!

06:55.880 --> 06:57.320
Didn't want to worry you.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.560
Anyway, six hours is a lifetime...
not literally a lifetime,

07:00.560 --> 07:05.160
that's what we're trying to avoid.
And we're all really clever!

07:05.160 --> 07:07.760
Let's see what we can find out.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.920
(Come on.)

07:13.880 --> 07:15.520
Eugh!

07:15.520 --> 07:18.480
How many dinosaurs
do you think are on here?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.040
Oh, well done, whoever you are.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.960
Looking for engines.

07:26.960 --> 07:31.080
Thank you, computer.
Look at that, different sections
have different engines,

07:31.080 --> 07:33.200
but these look like
the primary clusters.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.200
Where are we now, computer? We need
to get down to these engines...

07:39.280 --> 07:42.040
What happened?
Oh, great!

07:42.040 --> 07:44.640
..and find out how...

07:44.640 --> 07:46.440
What?!

07:46.440 --> 07:49.040
We're outside. We're on a beach.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.040
Teleport! Oh, I hate teleports.
Must have activated on my voice.

07:53.040 --> 07:57.320
Ah, yes, well, thank you,
Arthur C Clarke!

07:57.320 --> 08:02.640
Teleport, obviously, I mean, we're
on a spaceship, with dinosaurs,
why wouldn't there be a teleport?

08:02.640 --> 08:05.320
In fact why don't we just
teleport now?!

08:06.520 --> 08:08.440
Is he all right?

08:08.440 --> 08:11.920
He hates travelling.
Makes him anxious. He only goes
to the paper shop and golf.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.640
What did you bring him for?

08:13.640 --> 08:17.600
I didn't! Why can't you just phone
ahead, like any normal person?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.400
Can somebody tell me
where we are, now?

08:24.000 --> 08:28.040
Well, it's not Earth.
Doesn't taste right, too metallic.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.040
BIRDLIKE SCREECHING

08:30.040 --> 08:32.000
Is that a kestrel?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.200
I do hope so.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.760
The beach is humming.
Is it? Oh, yes!

08:36.760 --> 08:39.200
Right, well, don't just
stand there, you two, dig!

08:39.200 --> 08:42.440
I'm going to look at rocks.
Love a rock.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.400
Dig with what?
Ah! Well!

08:47.960 --> 08:49.720
Did you just have that on you?

08:49.720 --> 08:54.000
Of course! What sort of a man
doesn't carry a trowel?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.480
Put it on your Christmas list.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.960
Dad, I'm 31. I don't have
a Christmas list any more.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.400
I do!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.160
METALLIC TING

09:04.960 --> 09:08.040
There's a floor under this beach!

09:08.040 --> 09:12.400
'Doctor! Doctor!'

09:12.400 --> 09:16.600
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he called him?

09:16.600 --> 09:19.400
Doctor! After all this time!

09:21.640 --> 09:23.000
Bring them to me.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.400
There are clearly more than just
two of those creatures.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.680
Hey, put that away,
I need you sober.

09:31.680 --> 09:35.880
It's medicinal. And I don't take
orders from females.

09:35.880 --> 09:40.920
Then learn. Any man who speaks to me
that way, I execute.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.520
You're very welcome to try.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.000
Sorry, what was your name again?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.040
Lady of the Two Lands,

09:49.040 --> 09:54.120
wife of the Great King Amenhotep,
Queen Nefertiti of Egypt.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.960
I'll be damned...

09:55.960 --> 10:02.080
Oh, my God! Queen Nefertiti!
I learned all about you at school.
You're awesome! Big fan, high-five!

10:03.600 --> 10:07.320
Yeah, bit behind on that.
You're really famous.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.600
Ssh! Listen.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.680
LOUD, RUMBLING SNORTS

10:19.000 --> 10:23.880
OK. At a guess, T-Rex.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.560
Not yet full size.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.440
We're in the middle
of a dinosaur nest.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.520
I propose a retreat.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.880
Or perhaps forwards.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.360
Agreed. Just don't wake the baby.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.400
Who are you, anyway?

10:59.400 --> 11:04.560
John Riddell. Big game hunter
on the African plains.
I'm sure you've heard of me, too.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.920
No. You clearly have some alarming
gaps in your education.

11:07.920 --> 11:12.440
Or men who hunt
defenceless creatures
just don't impact on history.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.920
Face it, she's way cooler than you.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.360
And you, Amy? Are you also a queen?

11:19.800 --> 11:22.720
Yes. Yes, I am.

11:24.320 --> 11:29.440
See! Metal floor, screens in rocks.
It was just a short-range teleport.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.000
We're still on the ship.
No. We're outside, on a beach.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.320
No, it's part of the ship, Dad.
Don't be ridiculous.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.480
Well, it is quite ridiculous,
also brilliant.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.360
That's why the system teleported us
here - I wanted the engines.

11:40.360 --> 11:45.240
This is the engine room!
Hydro-generators.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.760
I have literally no idea
what he's saying.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.280
A spaceship powered by waves.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.520
Fabulously impossible!
Oh, think of the things
we could learn from this ship

11:53.520 --> 11:55.920
if we manage to stop it being
blown to pieces.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.040
Plus, not dying.
Bad news is - can't shut
the wave systems down in time.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.480
Takes...takes way too long.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.800
If these are the engines,
there must be a control room.
That's what we need to find.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.160
Now, what do we do about the things
that aren't kestrels?

12:10.160 --> 12:13.200
CREATURES SCREECHING

12:13.200 --> 12:14.720
Oh, my Lord.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.000
Are those pterodactyls?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.760
Yes. On any other occasion,
I'd be thrilled.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.400
Exposed on a beach, less than
thrilled. We should be going.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.600
Where? Definitely away from them!

12:26.600 --> 12:30.400
That's the plan?!
Amendments welcome! Move away
from the pterodactyls!

12:30.400 --> 12:32.520
I think they might be noticing!

12:32.520 --> 12:36.040
Amended plan - run!
Can't we just teleport or something?

12:36.040 --> 12:38.600
No, local teleport's burned out
on arrival.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.520
There's an opening
in the cliffs over there!

12:48.520 --> 12:50.560
Come on, run!

12:50.560 --> 12:52.240
I'm trying!

13:02.040 --> 13:03.280
Are you all right?

13:03.280 --> 13:07.560
Yeah, I'm fine. What do we do now?
There's no way back out there.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.520
Through the cave, come on.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
LOUD THUDDING

13:11.520 --> 13:13.240
That suggestion was
a work in progress.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.800
We're trapped!

13:15.800 --> 13:18.080
Yes, thanks for spelling it out.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.520
Doctor, whatever's down there
is coming this way.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.560
Spelling-it-out is hereditary,
wonderful!

13:23.560 --> 13:25.360
That sound's getting nearer!

13:42.800 --> 13:44.760
We're very cross with you!

13:50.840 --> 13:53.720
Bit of weedkiller
wouldn't go amiss in here.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.960
Whoever was running this vessel
left in a hurry.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.600
Maybe a plague came and took them.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.600
No, there'd be corpses and bones.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.080
Unless the animals ate them.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.640
Whoa, Chuckle Brothers,
lighten up, would ya?

14:08.920 --> 14:10.960
COMPUTER HUMS INTO LIFE

14:10.960 --> 14:12.840
How did you know
how to do that?

14:12.840 --> 14:15.080
I've spent enough time
with the Doctor to know

14:15.080 --> 14:17.560
whenever you enter somewhere new,
press buttons.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.600
What else have you learned from him?

14:19.600 --> 14:22.520
Don't stop at button-pressing.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.200
'One hundred and seventeen years...'
Data records.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.480
Ship's owners?
Could be. Come on, help us out...

14:32.480 --> 14:33.840
'..will remain cryogenic...'

14:33.840 --> 14:35.840
DINOSAUR SNARLS AND SNORTS

14:39.120 --> 14:43.440
'..space sleep...
I will continue to work...'

14:43.440 --> 14:46.840
How about a picture?
Come on, for me!

14:46.840 --> 14:48.480
'..far beyond our mapping...'

14:49.480 --> 14:51.560
Look! It's beautiful.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.400
'I can't tell how far we have come.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.440
'Far enough to avoid the destructive
impact forecast for our planet.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.320
'Far enough for me to feel
a profound sense of loss.'

15:05.320 --> 15:06.640
What is that?

15:08.480 --> 15:10.320
Silurian.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.240
You're going straight on
the naughty step!

15:14.240 --> 15:16.760
(What's the escape plan?)

15:16.760 --> 15:19.840
Why do we want to escape?

15:19.840 --> 15:21.480
(They have us hostage.)

15:21.480 --> 15:24.640
They're taking us somewhere.
We might learn from it.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.960
Oh, you see? So clever.
I missed you, Rory!

15:27.960 --> 15:30.840
Don't do that. What if they kill us?
They wouldn't do that!

15:30.840 --> 15:33.800
You're not going to kill us,
are you, rusty?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.080
Who are you calling Rusty?!
Have you seen yourself lately?

15:37.080 --> 15:39.320
You try being on this ship
for two millennia,

15:39.320 --> 15:41.520
see how YOUR paintwork does!

15:41.520 --> 15:45.680
Don't listen to him, he's just
being mean cos we captured him.

15:45.680 --> 15:49.040
Oh, my goodness... Whoa. Ooh.

15:50.080 --> 15:55.440
Herbivore, Brian, don't panic.
Triceratops. Ha! Beautiful.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.560
Shall I shoot it? We're not supposed
to shoot the creatures, stupid!

15:58.560 --> 16:00.320
Stop calling me stupid!
IT ROARS

16:00.320 --> 16:04.240
"Rargh" yourself! Hello, cutie-pie.

16:04.240 --> 16:08.440
Who's a lovely Tricey then, eh?
Yes, you are.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.440
Yes, you are.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.160
What do I do?! What do I do?!

16:14.120 --> 16:15.680
What's it doing?!

16:18.320 --> 16:22.160
You don't have any vegetable matter
in your trousers, do you, Brian?

16:22.160 --> 16:23.920
Only my balls.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.080
I'm sorry?
Golf balls. Grassy residue.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.040
What're you
carrying those around for?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.440
Urgh! Eurgh!

16:37.480 --> 16:39.400
Argh! Aw, bless.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.360
Get it away from me!

16:42.360 --> 16:44.680
Throw one. Really?

16:44.680 --> 16:47.920
Is this what you want? Is it?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.240
And breathe out.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.000
Right! Take us to your leader.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.480
Really? Too good to resist.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.599
Of the 50 species loaded,

17:05.599 --> 17:08.720
only one has had
any difficulty in surviving.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.000
All the others are thriving

17:11.000 --> 17:14.560
and we expect them
to be able to repopulate.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.400
We're on an ark. A Silurian ark.

17:17.400 --> 17:22.280
Lizard people herding dinosaurs on
to a space ark?! Absolute tommy-rot.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.160
Only an idiot denies the evidence
of their own eyes.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.480
Egyptian queen or not,

17:26.480 --> 17:29.520
I shall put you across my knee
and spank you. Oh, Lord.

17:29.520 --> 17:33.120
Try and I'll snap your neck
in a heartbeat.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.680
Mm. Well, they certainly bred
firecrackers in your time

17:36.680 --> 17:39.160
Aw, no, no, no.
Please, don't start flirting.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.240
I will not have flirting companions!

17:41.240 --> 17:45.440
If the Doctor trusts Amy, so do I.
Stop doubting her.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.920
If this ship was built by...
Silurians, yeah.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.400
Where are they?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.000
Surprisingly good question.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.080
Display life signs
for homo reptilia.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.080
But where have they gone?

18:05.080 --> 18:08.280
Perhaps they found another world,
left the ship.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.000
Why are the dinosaurs
still on board?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.840
And why is the ship
coming back to Earth?

18:11.840 --> 18:15.360
It doesn't make sense.
What's changed between then and now?

18:15.360 --> 18:18.960
Wait - computer, show me the ship
at launch with all life signals.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.000
Now show me the ship today
with all life signals.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.440
Thousands less. But why? I mean...

18:28.440 --> 18:30.560
Show me both images, then and now,
side by side.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.000
What are you looking for?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.080
OK, two images, spot the difference.
What changed?

18:35.080 --> 18:37.280
What happened to the Silurians?

18:37.280 --> 18:40.320
The centre.
Computer, zoom in to the centre.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.280
Oh, no. What is it?

18:44.440 --> 18:46.200
Another spacecraft.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.520
This ship's been boarded before.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.800
Love what you've done
with the place down here.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.800
Let him in. Open the gate. >

19:14.200 --> 19:18.200
PIANO MUSIC PLAYS
It's fine. It's fine.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.120
He's not interested in YOU.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.560
Look, you need to learn
some manners.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.440
No, YOU need to learn some manners!

19:25.440 --> 19:27.840
No, YOU do!

19:27.840 --> 19:30.720
No, YOU do! Mr...Manners!

19:30.720 --> 19:35.920
Fantasia in F Minor for four hands.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.640
You know it. Know it?

19:40.640 --> 19:43.000
Say hello to hands three and four!

19:43.000 --> 19:45.280
Schubert kept tickling me
to try and put me off.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.880
Franz the Hands.
Oh, that takes me back.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.000
Well, this is...

19:51.000 --> 19:52.640
cosy.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.280
It's fate you came.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.400
Is it? I'm the Doctor

20:01.400 --> 20:03.120
Yes, I know.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.440
I'm Solomon.
COMPUTER BEEPS

20:07.440 --> 20:08.680
What's that?

20:10.880 --> 20:14.400
System malfunction, ignore it.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.160
What happened to you?

20:16.160 --> 20:20.240
I was attacked. Three raptors.
They cornered me.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.360
The robots rescued me,
but it was nearly too late

20:25.360 --> 20:27.120
Ah, yes. The robots.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.120
They're...unusual.

20:31.120 --> 20:35.120
I got them cheap,
from a concession on Illyria Seven.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.080
The robots did as best
they could with my legs, but...

20:40.680 --> 20:43.520
..you can help me so much more.

20:44.600 --> 20:49.520
Oh, a "doctor" doctor! I see.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.560
Let's have a look.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.360
They chewed through
part of the bone in my legs.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.200
HE GASPS WITH PAIN
Yes, very nasty.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.280
But you can repair them.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.320
If you tell me
how you came by so many dinosaurs.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.920
COMPUTER BEEPS
Injure the older one.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.520
What?

21:26.480 --> 21:29.600
Dad! Dad...

21:31.080 --> 21:34.720
It's all right, Dad,
it's OK, it's OK.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.920
I don't respond well
to violence, Solomon.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.640
And I don't like questions, Doctor.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.240
You boarded without my permission.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.880
Now, fix me or the next bolt
will be fatal.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.000
I will take you apart cog by cog,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.840
and melt you down
when all this is over.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.480
Oh, I'm so scared(!)
Actually, I might be.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.560
A little bit of oil just came out.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.160
Stay still. It's just a burn,
it's nothing serious.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.080
What's that? Well, you carry
a trowel, I carry a medpack.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.960
It's all about the pockets
in our family.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.840
This is an ice patch.
It cools the skin.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.640
Never seen one of those. I look out
for cool stuff wherever we go.

22:16.640 --> 22:22.040
Some people it's cars and hardware,
for me it is nursing supplies.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.920
Now...painkiller.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.880
Now, this won't hurt.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.000
Ow! I lied.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.640
It won't hurt from now on, though.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.640
All right. You're done. Thanks.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.240
S'all right.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.240
You get to see my awesome
nursing skills in action for once.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.440
PHONE RINGS
What's that?

22:43.440 --> 22:46.200
Your phone's ringing. In space!

22:46.200 --> 22:49.680
You get used to it.
I have to take this. The wife.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.920
Hello, Mrs. Where are you?

22:51.920 --> 22:53.520
Still on board.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.040
Met some pterodactyls and some rusty
robots, that I'm going to MELT DOWN.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.560
Rory, this is a Silurian ship.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.600
How did you get on board, Doctor?

23:06.360 --> 23:10.080
Oh, I never talk about myself
with a gun pointed at me.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.920
Let's talk about you.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.720
Your cosy little craft
embedded in a vast, old ship.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.400
Very observant. I'm a Sagittarius.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.760
Probably.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.640
I'm transporting it
to the Roxborne Peninsula.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.240
The commerce colony.
You're a trader.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.760
I search out opportunities for
profit across the nine galaxies.

23:32.760 --> 23:37.240
Ah, the purple light.
That's what it was.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.120
An IV system - identify and value:

23:40.120 --> 23:42.520
the database of everything
across space and time,

23:42.520 --> 23:44.280
allocated a market value.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.560
Argos for the universe.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.960
You were trying to find out
how much I'm worth.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.640
Would you like to know?

24:08.840 --> 24:10.280
You don't exist.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.880
It's never done that.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.680
That's me. Worthless.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.160
Unlike these creatures
you have on board.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.280
Very valuable...

24:22.480 --> 24:25.600
..given they're extinct.
DEVICE WHINES

24:25.600 --> 24:27.680
HE GROANS WITH PAIN

24:27.680 --> 24:31.480
Done, sit up. Very slowly.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.080
Doctor? Amy.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.440
I need to take this.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.280
Amy.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.720
This is an ark, built by
the Silurians. They were looking
for another planet.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.200
Where are they now? None on board.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.200
I mean, thousands of stasis pods -
all empty. I'll see you soon.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.520
(Be ready.)

24:56.520 --> 25:00.120
The pain in my legs. It's gone.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.800
I can move them.
Thank you, Doctor.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.480
What did you do to the Silurians?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.360
We ejected them.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.240
The robots woke them from
cryo-sleep a handful at a time,

25:15.240 --> 25:17.320
and jettisoned them
from the airlocks.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.440
We must have left
a trail of dust and bone.

25:22.440 --> 25:25.240
Because you wanted the dinosaurs.

25:25.240 --> 25:28.400
Their ship crossed my path.

25:28.400 --> 25:32.120
I sent out a distress signal.
They let me board.

25:32.120 --> 25:37.200
But when I saw the cargo,
things became more complex.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.480
Piracy and then genocide.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.960
Very emotive words, Doctor.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.840
Oh, I'm a very emotive man.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.480
The lizards wouldn't negotiate.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.640
I made them a generous offer.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.840
The creatures on board this ship are
not objects to be sold or traded.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.280
I feel like you're judging me.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.240
You said Roxborne Peninsula,
so why are you heading to Earth?

25:56.240 --> 25:58.240
You're on the wrong course.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.800
Oh.

26:03.840 --> 26:08.040
You don't know how.
Ha! Brilliant.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.200
You couldn't change
the pre-programmed course.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.720
Without instructions,
the ship defaulted, returned home.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.240
Oh, dear.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.320
The Silurians outwitted you,
even after you'd massacred them.

26:20.320 --> 26:25.080
So now you're a prisoner
on the ship that you hijacked.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.720
Not now you're here.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.000
You're going to help me
to where I want to go, Doctor.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.520
Little bit of news, Solomon.
You're being targeted by missiles.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.840
Get off this ship...

26:39.400 --> 26:41.960
..while you still can.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.120
You think I believe that?

26:45.120 --> 26:48.400
You just want them for yourself.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.320
You won't profit from me, Doctor.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.440
Don't ever judge me
by your standards.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.560
Well, don't just stand there, Rory!
Hey, he wants to see you.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.480
Dad, up!

27:05.000 --> 27:09.320
What're we doing?! Just do
exactly as I do! Doctor, no!

27:09.320 --> 27:10.920
Geronimo!

27:15.200 --> 27:19.000
Did you call?
What're you doing?! Stop them!

27:19.000 --> 27:21.600
All right! Don't shout.
Useless machines!

27:25.160 --> 27:30.120
Go, Tricey! Run like the wind!
TRICERATOPS BELLOWS

27:34.560 --> 27:36.240
How do you start a triceratops?!

27:38.000 --> 27:41.320
There they are.
I know! I saw them before you.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.280
Tricey, fetch!

27:46.840 --> 27:50.880
Ha-ha! That-a-boy! Yee-hah!

27:52.840 --> 27:54.520
Come on, Tricey!

27:56.440 --> 27:59.120
Woo-hoo!

27:59.120 --> 28:02.520
They've stolen a dinosaur!
I can see that.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.600
Come on, Tricey! Faster, baby!

28:13.880 --> 28:15.720
Whoa!

28:15.720 --> 28:18.360
They're turning off,
we're losing them!

28:18.360 --> 28:21.840
Which way did they go?
I thought you were looking!

28:21.840 --> 28:24.360
No! Now they've got away.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.240
We definitely used to be faster.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.160
I'm riding a dinosaur!
On a spaceship! I know!

28:31.160 --> 28:35.280
I only came round to fix your light!
Come on, Tricey!

28:37.560 --> 28:39.840
Where are the brakes?!

28:39.840 --> 28:41.760
ALL: Whoa!

28:44.480 --> 28:46.600
Argh!

28:54.720 --> 28:57.560
THEY GROAN

28:57.560 --> 29:00.760
TRICERATOPS GRUNTS

29:07.560 --> 29:10.480
Good, that worked! OK...

29:10.480 --> 29:13.960
Where are we now? Ooh.

29:13.960 --> 29:18.640
Incoming message from Earth.
Hello, Earth! How are things?

29:18.640 --> 29:22.400
Doctor, the ship's coming
through the atmosphere.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.160
I have to start the missile program.
No. No, no, no - don't do that,

29:25.160 --> 29:27.720
everything's under control here,
turning round any moment.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.560
Need a bit of wriggle room
on the timings...

29:29.560 --> 29:33.720
I can't do that.
You can, of course you can.
Tiny bit more time, Indira, please.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.920
This ship contains
the most precious cargo...

29:35.920 --> 29:39.560
'My only responsibility
is the Earth's safety.'

29:39.560 --> 29:43.520
I'm launching the missiles.
Goodbye, Doctor.

29:43.520 --> 29:47.280
No Indira! Hey, come back! Please!

29:47.280 --> 29:49.400
LOUDSPEAKER: 'Target identified.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.760
'Navigation systems
locking on to target.

29:51.760 --> 29:56.720
'Missile launch procedure initiated.
Estimated impact: 30 minutes.'

29:58.040 --> 30:01.280
Now these are what we need -
dinosaur protection.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.560
No weapons!

30:07.960 --> 30:09.480
Anaesthetic.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.800
These are stun guns.
You're almost clever.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.680
Enough to make a dinosaur
take a nap.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.680
Even the Doctor
couldn't object to that.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.560
You and the Doctor...
Are you his queen?

30:19.560 --> 30:20.920
No, no, I'm Rory's queen.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.600
Wife. I'm his wife. Please don't
tell him I said I was his queen -

30:24.600 --> 30:26.520
I'll never hear the end of it.

30:26.520 --> 30:30.520
And the Doctor, does he have a
queen? I thought you had a husband.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.480
A male equivalent
of a sleeping potion.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.880
You clearly need
a man of action and excitement.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.200
One with a very large weapon.

30:41.680 --> 30:45.760
So, human sleeping potion or
walking innuendo. Take your pick.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.400
'That's very bad indeed.
Completely unhelpful.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.120
'Doesn't this ship have any
defence systems installed?'

30:53.120 --> 30:55.320
Good thinking, Rory!

30:55.320 --> 30:57.680
Computer, show us weapons
and defence systems.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.520
Well, that was a waste of time,
wasn't it?

31:01.520 --> 31:04.720
Getting my hopes up like that.
What ship doesn't have weapons?

31:04.720 --> 31:07.160
The ancient species, Rory -
still full of hope.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.960
What about the control deck?

31:08.960 --> 31:10.880
You said we should go to
the control deck next.

31:10.880 --> 31:14.160
It's too late, it won't make any
difference. We could at least try.

31:14.160 --> 31:18.120
It won't work, Rory.
The missiles are locked on.
So, what? We're just giving up?

31:18.120 --> 31:20.720
I don't know.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.600
I don't know.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.760
You were telling the truth, Doctor.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.040
Earth has launched missiles.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.560
This vessel is too clumsy
to outrun them,

31:31.560 --> 31:34.280
but I have my own ship.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.480
You won't get your precious
cargo on board, though.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.160
It'll just be you
and your metal tantrum machines.

31:40.160 --> 31:44.640
We do not have tantrums! Shut up!

31:47.760 --> 31:49.680
You're right, Doctor.

31:49.680 --> 31:53.400
I can't keep the dinosaurs
and live myself.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.440
But I had the IV system
scan the entire ship

31:56.440 --> 31:59.240
and it found something
even more valuable.

31:59.240 --> 32:02.840
Utterly unique.

32:02.840 --> 32:07.680
I don't know where you found it or
how you got it here, but I want it.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.080
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.680
Earth Queen Nefertiti of Egypt.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.400
'A face stamped across history.'

32:17.400 --> 32:20.400
Give her to me
and I'll let the rest of you live.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.720
No.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.920
You think I won't punish
those who get in my way?

32:31.920 --> 32:33.760
Whatever their worth?

32:39.680 --> 32:42.000
TRICERATOPS ROARS

32:47.960 --> 32:50.200
TRICERATOPS WHIMPERS

32:58.000 --> 33:01.160
TRICERATOPS WHIMPERS

33:18.280 --> 33:20.000
You must be very proud.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.360
Bring her to me. Or the robots will
make their way through your corpses.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.840
Bring her now. No.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.160
What are you doing?

33:43.160 --> 33:45.360
I demanded to be brought here.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.600
No, no, no, no - no way. It isn't
your choice, Doctor. It's mine.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.800
Listen to me, if you go with him,
I can't guarantee your safety

33:51.800 --> 33:54.520
You saved my people.
I am in your debt.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.160
No. No debts,
you don't owe me anything

33:57.160 --> 34:00.600
Then I do it of my own will.
Neffy, Neffy, Neffy...

34:00.600 --> 34:02.080
No! Take her, I shoot you.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.440
Put your weapon down.
Let me make my choice.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.520
Do it, boy.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.320
My bounty increases.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.360
And what an extraordinary
bounty you are.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.280
Never touch me.

34:31.960 --> 34:35.040
I like my possessions
to have spirit.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.520
It means I can have fun
breaking them.

34:40.440 --> 34:44.000
And I will break you in,
with immense pleasure.

34:48.040 --> 34:53.080
Thank you, Doctor.
Computer? Take us back to my ship.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.360
COMPUTER: 'Hostile targeting
in progress.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.840
'Hostile targeting in progress.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.000
'Hostile targeting in progress.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.160
'Hostile targeting in progress.

35:08.160 --> 35:14.000
'Hostile targeting in progress.'
Bingo. What is it? Doctor?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.600
OK, Control deck.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.000
So, what's the plan?

35:19.000 --> 35:22.240
Come on. The missiles are locked on
to us, we can't outrun them,

35:22.240 --> 35:25.960
we have to save the dinosaurs
and get Nefertiti back from Solomon,
isn't it obvious?!

35:25.960 --> 35:27.520
It's sort of
the opposite of obvious.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.000
17 minutes before the missiles hit,
we need to turn this ship around.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.880
You said it was too late,
there wasn't any time.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.640
Ah, yes, but I didn't have
this plan then, did I?

35:36.640 --> 35:39.240
Riddell? Keep an eye out
for dinosaurs.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.120
I was rather hoping you'd say that.

35:41.120 --> 35:44.440
No killing any. Rory, Brian,
get rid of the cobwebs.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.280
Come on, come on. We're not moving.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.440
METAL CLANGS

35:57.000 --> 36:01.080
He's magnetised us.
We can't move away!

36:05.560 --> 36:08.040
SOMETHING GROWLS

36:14.280 --> 36:17.160
Keep walking, big chap.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.560
SOMETHING GROWLS AGAIN

36:25.360 --> 36:29.080
Hell's teeth,
that's really not fair!

36:29.080 --> 36:32.640
'Missile target will be reached
in 11 minutes.'

36:32.640 --> 36:36.920
No - don't be like that! Really
unhelpful. What's the matter?

36:36.920 --> 36:40.920
Parallel pilot compartments,
bio-configured, needs two operators
of the same gene chain.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.320
That's why Solomon
couldn't change the ship's course

36:43.320 --> 36:45.560
and neither can we. What?

36:45.560 --> 36:47.160
We can.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.800
Me and Rory. We must be the same
gene thingy-you-just-said.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.400
Brian Pond, you are delicious.
I'm not a Pond. Course you are.

36:55.400 --> 36:59.240
Sit down, both of you.
Ship does all the engineering,
the controls are straightforward,

36:59.240 --> 37:02.800
even a monkey could use them -
oh, look - they're going to.

37:05.520 --> 37:10.080
Guys, come on, comedy gold.
Where's a Silurian audience
when you need one?

37:10.080 --> 37:12.880
Anyway, two eye-line screens -
velocity and trajectory.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.000
Steer away from Earth,
try not to bump into the moon

37:15.000 --> 37:17.120
otherwise the races
who live there will be livid.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.280
What? Primary controls
in the arms of the chairs,

37:19.280 --> 37:23.680
principle's the same as any vehicle.
Eight minutes, 45 seconds.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.440
Get us as far away as you can.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.840
Right, phase two sorted.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.720
Now for phase one.

37:33.720 --> 37:37.360
Phase two comes after phase one.
Humans, you're so linear.
Shine a torch in here.

37:37.360 --> 37:40.600
What're you doing?
Mixing my messages. How's the job?

37:40.600 --> 37:43.080
We're about to be hit by missiles
and you're asking me that?

37:43.080 --> 37:45.800
I work best when I'm multi-tasking.
Keep talking. How's the job?

37:45.800 --> 37:48.200
I gave it up.
You gave the last one up.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.040
Yeah, well I can't settle.
Every minute, I'm listening out

37:51.040 --> 37:53.760
for that stupid TARDIS sound.
Right, so it's my fault, is it?!

37:53.760 --> 37:57.800
I can't not wait for you. Even now.
And they're getting longer,
The gaps between your visits.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.760
Are they? I think you're weaning
us off you. I'm not, I promise.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.800
Really promise.
The others, they're not you.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.360
But you and Rory, you have lives.
Each other.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.200
I thought that's what we agreed.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.960
I know. I just worry there'll come
a time when you never turn up,

38:12.960 --> 38:14.840
that something
will have happened to you

38:14.840 --> 38:16.760
and I'll still be waiting,
never knowing.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.320
No! Come on, Pond.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.520
You'll be there till the end of me.
Or vice versa.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.480
SCREWDRIVER BEEPS
Done.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.720
Doctor? This is a two-man job.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.600
What're you doing?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.320
I'm easily worth two men.
You can help too, if you like.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.000
A-ha!
Doctor, what're you going to...?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.320
LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM

39:02.200 --> 39:03.600
Quickens the blood, doesn't it?

39:03.600 --> 39:06.280
The sooner this lot go back
to being extinct, the better.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.360
You know what
I want more than anything?

39:08.360 --> 39:11.480
Lessons in gender politics?
A dinosaur tooth to take home.

39:14.040 --> 39:17.120
Dinosaurs ahead, lady at my side,

39:17.120 --> 39:20.600
about to be blown up.
Not sure I've ever been happier.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.480
Shut up and shoot.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.880
Duck!

39:40.800 --> 39:43.280
I'm... I'm flying a spaceship.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.360
Rory! We're flying a spaceship!

39:45.360 --> 39:46.720
I know! Ha-ha!

39:51.400 --> 39:53.560
The ship's trajectory is changing...

39:53.560 --> 39:57.080
It makes no difference.
The missiles have locked on.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.680
How long till target?

40:00.280 --> 40:02.040
Seven minutes.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.200
Go-o-o! That's it, that's it!

40:09.680 --> 40:12.440
That's it, that's it!
Me, me, me, me! Yes, yes!

40:14.120 --> 40:15.800
This is better than golf.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.640
Hello! Having trouble leaving?

40:21.640 --> 40:26.800
BOTH: ♪ Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer... ♪

40:26.800 --> 40:29.440
Ship's still magnetised,
couldn't bear to lose you.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.200
Release my ship, Doctor,

40:31.200 --> 40:34.680
or I kill
this precious little object

40:41.120 --> 40:43.560
I am not your possession now,
nor will I ever be.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.520
Now stay there.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.480
Don't mess with
Egyptian queens, Solomon.

40:51.760 --> 40:55.080
I hope you've learnt that now.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.680
What're you doing?!
Disabling this ship's signal

40:57.680 --> 41:00.040
and replacing it with the one
from the Silurian ship.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.200
I send this craft off emitting
the signal they're looking for,

41:03.200 --> 41:04.960
the missiles will follow.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.280
Hopefully Silurian ship safe,
dinosaurs safe, everybody safe.

41:08.280 --> 41:12.120
Bit tight for time though, shouldn't
really be chatting. Neffy, let's go.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.200
How remiss of me, almost forgot -
the thing about missiles,

41:15.200 --> 41:19.240
very literal,
this is what they latch on to

41:19.240 --> 41:22.480
Now, one press on this
and the ship's demagnetised.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.480
Doctor, whatever you want,
I can get it for you,

41:25.480 --> 41:28.760
whatever object you desire.
Did the Silurians beg you to stop?

41:32.040 --> 41:35.080
Look, Solomon. The missiles.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.840
See them shine.
See how valuable they are.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.840
And they're all yours.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.680
You wouldn't leave me, Doctor...

41:42.680 --> 41:44.960
Enjoy your bounty.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.280
DOCTOR!

42:04.840 --> 42:06.720
DOCTOR!

42:17.200 --> 42:19.280
DINOSAURS WHIMPER

42:26.440 --> 42:28.800
So, dinosaur drop-off time.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.440
Actually, we think home for us.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.760
Oh. Fine. Of course.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.640
Not forever.
Just a couple of months.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.280
Right, yes, I'm pretty busy anyway.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.960
I mean, I've got to drop
everyone back

42:42.960 --> 42:46.720
About that. Can I ask a favour?

42:46.720 --> 42:48.880
There's something I want to see.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.600
Oh...

43:45.000 --> 43:47.320
MORE postcards from your Dad.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.560
Do you know what?
I think it is the fitting.

44:12.880 --> 44:17.120
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
