WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.713
- She totally winked at me!
- She did not wink at you.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.882
You always think somebody's
winking at you.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.390
Huh.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.448
I say "Tupelo Honey"
by Van Morrison.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.991
No way!

01:16.159 --> 01:18.994
The most romantic song ever
was "The Way We Were."

01:19.162 --> 01:24.333
Ah, I think the one that Elton John wrote
for, um, that guy on Who's the Boss?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.295
- What song was that?
- Um.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.673
Hold me close, young Tony Danza

01:36.513 --> 01:37.846
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi, Mon.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.681
Hey, Mon.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.976
Oh, my God!

01:43.144 --> 01:44.978
- Has she slept at all?
- Nope.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.064
It's been three nights in a row.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.066
She finally stopped crying yesterday.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.361
But then she found one of Richard's
cigar butts on the terrace...

01:52.529 --> 01:56.949
Oh. Okay, that explains it.
I got a call at 2 in the morning...

01:57.117 --> 01:59.368
...and all I could hear
was this squeaky sound.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.204
So I thought,
"Oh, it's a mouse or a possum."

02:03.873 --> 02:07.209
Then I realized, like, okay...

02:07.377 --> 02:11.421
...where would a mouse or a possum
get the money to make the phone call?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.635
- Morning.
- Morning. Hey.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.637
You made pancakes?

02:20.056 --> 02:22.307
Yeah, like there's any way
I could ever do that.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.019
Monica and Rachel had syrup

02:26.187 --> 02:29.439
Uh, uh
Now I can get my man to cheer up

02:32.026 --> 02:33.443
Good morning, Joey.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.903
Good morning.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.030
Here's a thought.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.075
Why don't you stay home from work
and just hang out with me?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.326
Oh, I wish.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.705
You have that report to finish,
and I've got to see my lawyer.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.041
I can't believe I date
a girl who's getting divorced.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.669
- I'm such a grownup.
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.546
I gotta go, I gotta go.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.089
Not without a kiss.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.383
Maybe I won't kiss you
so you'll stay.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.760
Kiss her. Kiss her!

03:00.638 --> 03:03.223
I'll see you later, sweetie.
Bye, Joey.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.434
Bye-bye, Janice.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.146
So when are you dumping her?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.397
Nope.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.648
Not this time.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.318
Heh. Come on, quit yanking me.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.448
I'm not yanking you.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.035
- This is Janice.
- Yeah, I know.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.786
She makes me happy.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.081
Okay. All right.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.752
You look me in the eye and tell me,
without blinking...

03:31.920 --> 03:34.755
...that you're not breaking up
with her. No blinking.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.384
I'm not breaking up with her!

03:45.099 --> 03:46.558
Ah!

03:46.768 --> 03:47.851
What's that?

03:48.019 --> 03:50.520
God, look what I found in the drain!

03:50.688 --> 03:52.147
What?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.525
It's some of Richard's hair!

03:55.693 --> 03:57.236
What do I do with this?

03:57.403 --> 04:00.405
Getting it away from me
would be job one.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.660
It's weird, but I don't want
to throw this away.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.870
This is all I have left of him.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.622
Gross...

04:09.374 --> 04:10.624
...drain hair.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.292
Ew!

04:17.005 --> 04:22.261
Cool! Oh, it looks like a tiny
little person drowning in your cereal.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.808
- God, what is wrong with me?
- You need to get some sleep.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.309
I need to get some Richard.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.065
You broke up with him for a reason.

04:35.233 --> 04:39.236
I know. I know.
I'm just so tired of missing him.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.531
Tired of wondering why he
hasn't called. Why hasn't he?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.825
Maybe because you told him not to?

04:45.660 --> 04:47.911
What are you, the Memory Woman?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.915
They're not breaking up!
Chandler and Janice?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.584
They're not breaking up!
He didn't blink!

04:56.045 --> 04:58.505
I'm not surprised.
Have you seen them together?

04:58.673 --> 04:59.965
They're really cute.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.093
"Cute"? This is Janice!

05:03.344 --> 05:04.594
You remember Janice?

05:04.762 --> 05:07.264
Yes, I remember. She's annoying.
But you know what?

05:07.432 --> 05:10.183
She's his girlfriend now.
I mean, what can we do?

05:10.351 --> 05:14.021
There you go! That's the spirit
I'm looking for! "What can we do?"

05:14.772 --> 05:15.856
Huh?

05:16.024 --> 05:18.567
All right, who's first, huh? Ross?

05:18.735 --> 05:21.403
Chandler's our friend,
and Janice makes him happy.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.364
So I say we be adult about it
and accept her.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.366
We'll call that Plan B.

05:48.765 --> 05:49.931
Honey...

05:50.099 --> 05:52.434
...I was wondering...
- Mm.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.438
...do you still have
that, um, Navy uniform?

05:57.857 --> 06:00.609
No, I had to return it
to the costume place.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.860
Oh.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.196
I think I have an old band uniform
from high school.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.324
You remember not having sex
in high school, right?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.368
Yeah.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.623
Well, honey, what about you?

06:14.791 --> 06:15.874
- What?
- I mean...

06:17.293 --> 06:22.297
Do you have any fun, you know,
fantasy-type things?

06:23.299 --> 06:24.883
No.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.178
Come on. You gotta have one.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.180
Nope.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.849
- Ross, you know what?
- What?

06:33.017 --> 06:36.728
If you tell me, I might do it.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.154
Okay.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.073
- Ahem.
- Um.

06:48.241 --> 06:52.160
Did you ever see, um,
Return of the Jedi?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.876
Yeah.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.839
Do you remember the scene...

07:05.508 --> 07:07.676
...with, um, Jabba the Hutt?

07:09.720 --> 07:13.515
Jabba had as his prisoner...

07:13.683 --> 07:14.891
...Princess Leia.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.687
Oh.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.856
Princess Leia was wearing...

07:21.023 --> 07:25.694
...this, um, gold bikini thing.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.031
It was pretty cool.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.705
Yeah, Princess Leia and the gold bikini?
Oh, every guy our age loved that.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.333
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Mm.

07:40.710 --> 07:44.421
It's huge! That's the moment when
she stopped being a princess...

07:44.589 --> 07:47.424
...and she became, like, you know,
a woman.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.220
Did you ever do the Leia thing?

07:52.388 --> 07:53.972
Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.270
Really? That great, huh?

08:00.438 --> 08:03.773
No, it's just that I got this new
pager, and I have it on "vibrate."

08:08.905 --> 08:10.489
See you.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.740
Hey.

08:11.908 --> 08:12.991
Hi, you guys!

08:13.159 --> 08:15.744
Look who I found standing
outside the Szechuan Dragon...

08:15.912 --> 08:18.622
...staring at a parking meter.

08:18.789 --> 08:23.084
- Ahem. Mon. Hi.
- Hi.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.463
- Why aren't you at work?
- Oh, they sent me home.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.131
Why?

08:28.299 --> 08:31.176
Because I don't work
at the Szechuan Dragon.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.511
You really need to get some sleep.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.846
I know I do.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.472
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.517
Guess what?
They published my paper.

08:38.683 --> 08:41.852
- Oh! Really? Let me see, let me see.
- Uh-huh.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.230
Rach, look!

08:43.438 --> 08:44.564
- No.
- Ooh.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.316
Hi. Ha, ha.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.236
Ha, ha! Oh.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.030
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker
to come rescue me?

08:58.454 --> 08:59.579
There he is!

09:04.335 --> 09:05.585
- Hey.
- Wheel!

09:05.753 --> 09:08.088
- Of!
- Fortune!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.590
This guy's so stupid.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.259
It's Count Rushmore!

09:16.472 --> 09:18.473
You should really go on this show.

09:20.226 --> 09:24.020
I got three tickets to
the Rangers tonight. What do you say?

09:24.188 --> 09:26.231
I say I am there!

09:26.399 --> 09:28.108
Cool! Oh.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.359
Is Ross going too?

09:29.527 --> 09:30.902
No. Janice.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.113
Janice?

09:33.864 --> 09:37.242
Because I just feel bad for Ross,
you know?

09:37.410 --> 09:42.163
We always go together. We're like
The Three Hockey-teers, you know?

09:42.665 --> 09:47.210
I may be way out on a limb here,
but do you have a problem with Janice?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.004
No!

09:49.630 --> 09:50.880
Yes...

09:51.549 --> 09:54.175
Oh, God, how do I say this? Uh...

09:55.011 --> 09:57.095
Oh! Ah!

09:57.555 --> 10:00.140
You know that girl from the
restaurant with the hair?

10:00.308 --> 10:03.351
Ooh! That girl that I hate?
Ugh! She drives me crazy. Ew.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.312
Oh.

10:05.521 --> 10:09.774
Look, I don't hate Janice.
She's just a lot to take, you know?

10:12.361 --> 10:14.738
- Well, there you go.
- Oh.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.698
Don't look at me like that.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.326
She drove you nuts before too,
remember?

10:19.535 --> 10:22.621
I'm crazy about her now.
This could be the real thing.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.873
Capital R, capital T!

10:27.043 --> 10:29.711
Don't worry, those are
the right letters.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.632
Look, what do you want me to say?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.217
I want you to say that you like her!

10:36.385 --> 10:39.346
I can't. It's like this chemical thing,
you know?

10:39.513 --> 10:42.474
Every time she starts laughing,
I just wanna...

10:45.019 --> 10:48.396
...pull my arm off so
I have something to throw at her.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.775
Thanks for trying.

10:53.486 --> 10:57.489
Oh, and by the way,
there is no Count Rushmore!

10:57.990 --> 11:00.909
Then who's the guy that painted
the faces on the mountain?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.416
- Ugh.
- How could you tell her?

11:08.584 --> 11:11.461
I didn't think
it would be that big a deal!

11:11.629 --> 11:13.505
Oh. She didn't think
it would be a big deal!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.965
Who are you talking to
when you do that?

11:17.259 --> 11:21.596
Look, that was supposed to be
a private, personal thing between us.

11:21.764 --> 11:26.017
Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay?
We tell each other everything.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.019
Guys do the same thing.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.106
I mean, what about all that
locker-room stuff?

11:31.273 --> 11:34.150
That's different.
That's like, uh, who dated a stripper?

11:34.318 --> 11:37.821
Or who did it on the back
of the Staten Island ferry?

11:38.698 --> 11:39.781
- Both of those Joey?
- Yeah.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.536
But you don't talk about
your girlfriend...

11:44.704 --> 11:47.914
...and the intimate stuff
you do with her.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.792
- Not even with your best friend?
- No.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.043
That is so sad.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.131
You're missing out on so much.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.050
I mean, the bonding and the sharing...

11:59.301 --> 12:02.971
...and knowing they're going through
the same thing you are.

12:03.139 --> 12:07.642
Oh. So, what, you tell each
other everything?

12:08.477 --> 12:09.561
Pretty much.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.025
Did you talk about
the Night of Five Times?

12:19.238 --> 12:22.157
Do you tell people about
the Night of Five Times?

12:22.324 --> 12:24.659
Uh, honey, that was with Carol.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.079
I know, but it's still worth
mentioning, I think.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.209
Relax every muscle in your body.

12:35.045 --> 12:39.174
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.844
Okay, now close your eyes...

12:43.012 --> 12:46.014
...and think of a happy place.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.057
Tell me your happy place.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.685
Richard's living room, drinking wine.

12:50.853 --> 12:56.065
No, no, no. Not a Richard thing.
Just put down the glass and get out.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.194
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.

12:59.361 --> 13:04.199
Okay, fine. Use my happy place.
Just don't move anything in there.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.618
I'll try not to.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.872
Okay. All right, so,
you're in a meadow...

13:11.040 --> 13:13.917
...millions of stars in the sky...

13:14.084 --> 13:16.127
You think breaking up was a mistake?

13:16.295 --> 13:18.713
There are no questions
in the happy place.

13:19.882 --> 13:26.387
Just the warm breeze and the
moonlight flowing through the trees.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.890
I'll bet he's over me.
I'll bet he's fine.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.769
Betting and wagering of any kind
are not permitted in the happy place.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.229
Okay?

13:34.396 --> 13:37.899
There's just, you know,
the lovely waterfalls...

13:38.067 --> 13:40.610
...and the trickling fountains...

13:40.778 --> 13:45.740
...and the calming sounds
of the babbling brook.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.742
- Okay, this isn't working.
- Oh.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.452
I'm still awake,
and now I have to pee.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.079
Oh.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.122
So I hear...

13:53.290 --> 13:54.707
...you hate me!

13:55.918 --> 14:00.421
I, uh, never said hate.
I was very careful about that.

14:00.589 --> 14:05.844
A little birdie told me you wanting to
rip your arm off and throw it at me.

14:07.304 --> 14:11.558
And you got "hate" from that?
You're taking a big leap there, I, uh...

14:11.725 --> 14:13.601
All right, fine, fine, fine!

14:13.769 --> 14:17.605
We have got to do something about
our little situation here.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.399
So this is my idea.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.486
You and me spending
some quality time together.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.030
But what does that...?

14:26.198 --> 14:27.615
For Chandler!

14:29.159 --> 14:30.577
Okay. I'm in.

14:30.744 --> 14:36.749
Okay! This is what we'll call it:
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

14:37.626 --> 14:39.002
Does it have to be a day?

14:39.169 --> 14:43.631
Yes, because that's how long
it takes to love me.

14:44.174 --> 14:48.303
Yeah, I know. Ha.
I sleep in the next room.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.559
I went down to the post office...

14:54.727 --> 14:57.645
...and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered...

14:57.813 --> 15:00.815
...for Richard about the Civil War.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.109
He loved the Civil War.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.739
Do you want us to take you home?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.073
Uh-huh.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.995
Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.173
Women tell each other everything.
Did you know that?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.508
Ha, ha. Yeah.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.511
No, Chandler, everything.

15:31.513 --> 15:34.265
Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.852
Technique. Stamina. Girth.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.730
Girth?

15:41.565 --> 15:43.191
Why? Why? Why?

15:43.359 --> 15:45.401
Why would they do this?

15:46.487 --> 15:49.906
Rachel says sharing's great
and supposedly...

15:50.074 --> 15:52.575
...we ought to be doing it.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.954
Uh, do you want to?

15:57.581 --> 16:00.041
- We're not gonna talk about girth?
- No.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.418
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:02.586 --> 16:04.712
All right, you go first.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.632
- Okay. Okay, I'll go first.
- Okay.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.884
So, uh, the other night...

16:10.052 --> 16:13.638
...Rachel and I are in bed
talking about fantasies...

16:13.806 --> 16:17.809
...and I happened to describe
a particular...

16:18.394 --> 16:19.894
...Star Wars thing...

16:20.062 --> 16:22.271
- Princess Leia and the gold bikini.
- Yes.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.524
- I know!
- Yes.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.694
Whoa. Wow.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.404
- Well, that was easy. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.655
Okay, you go.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.906
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.451
Okay, you know when you're
in bed with a woman...

16:35.619 --> 16:36.703
Uh.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.248
...and, uh, ahem, you know,
you're fooling around...

16:40.416 --> 16:43.209
...and you get all these
mental images in your brain?

16:43.419 --> 16:46.671
Like Elle MacPherson
or the girl at the Xerox place?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.549
- With the bellybutton ring? Oh.
- Oh! I know.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.301
And then all of a sudden,
your mom pops into your head.

16:54.054 --> 16:57.724
And you're, like,
"Mom, get out of here!"

16:57.975 --> 17:00.601
But after that,
you can't think of anything else.

17:00.769 --> 17:06.065
And you can't stop what you're doing.
So it's kind of like you're...

17:06.442 --> 17:08.859
...you know, you know...

17:09.028 --> 17:11.029
You don't know!

17:12.573 --> 17:14.449
Your mom?

17:14.657 --> 17:18.202
You're telling me about your mom?
What's the matter with you?

17:19.079 --> 17:22.123
- You said...
- I said "share," not "scare"!

17:22.290 --> 17:24.375
Go sit over there!

17:29.715 --> 17:32.216
- We're back!
- Hey.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.178
What are you guys doing together?

17:35.345 --> 17:38.306
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

17:41.101 --> 17:42.518
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.021
We went to a Mets game.
We got Chinese food.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.232
And, uh, you know,
I love this woman. Ha-ha-ha.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.277
You have got competition, buddy.

17:52.696 --> 17:56.199
Well, I just came by
to give you a kiss.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.617
Mwah.

17:57.826 --> 18:02.997
I have to go pick up the baby.
So I'll see you later, sweetheart.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.373
You too, Chandler.

18:13.175 --> 18:18.429
- You still can't stand her, can you?
- I'm sorry, man. I tried! I really did!

18:20.557 --> 18:22.600
I appreciate you giving it a shot.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.103
But you know, the good thing...

18:25.270 --> 18:28.731
...is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived.

18:28.899 --> 18:32.151
And what's even more amazing,
so did she. Ha, ha.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.278
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.657
I guess that's something.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.659
Oh, man, that's huge!

18:39.827 --> 18:43.246
Now I know I can stand to be
around her. Which means...

18:43.413 --> 18:45.123
...I get to hang out with you.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.167
Which is kind of
the whole point anyway. Ha, ha.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.878
Okay.

18:52.923 --> 18:57.552
Oh, hey! We, uh, stopped by
the coffee shop and, uh, ran into Ross.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.350
Oh, God.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.103
If it makes you feel any better,
I do it too.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.814
Oh.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.899
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

19:12.067 --> 19:14.569
I always picture your mom
when I'm having sex.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.076
April 12, 1861.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.875
The United States garrison
at Fort Sumter was fired upon.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.253
It is now under bombardment by...

19:43.891 --> 19:45.391
Dad, what are you doing here?

19:45.601 --> 19:49.687
It's your mother's bridge night, so I
came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.689
Oh.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.360
Since when did you start
smoking cigars?

19:57.321 --> 20:01.282
I don't.
I just like the smell of them.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.827
So, uh,
what are you really doing here?

20:04.995 --> 20:07.205
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.625
Why wouldn't I be okay?

20:10.792 --> 20:12.210
I saw Richard.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.171
Oh?

20:15.464 --> 20:17.215
So how you doing?

20:17.466 --> 20:18.799
I'm fine.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.094
I'm just a little tired,
but I'm okay.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.097
- Ahem. How's Richard doing?
- You don't want to know.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.017
No, I really, really do.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.811
Well, he's doing terrible!

20:33.023 --> 20:34.565
Really?

20:35.192 --> 20:37.485
Worse than when he broke up
with Barbara.

20:38.654 --> 20:43.199
- You're not just saying that, are you?
- No, the man is a mess!

20:44.076 --> 20:46.661
- Was he crying?
- No.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.539
Do you think he was waiting till
after you left, so he could cry?

20:50.707 --> 20:52.416
Maybe.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.544
I think so.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.923
Honey, relationships are hard.
Like with your mom and me.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.927
You know, after we graduated from
college, we broke up for a while.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.638
It seems her father,
your grandfather...

21:05.806 --> 21:08.432
...wanted her to travel around Europe
like he did.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.352
Of course, he got to do it
on Uncle Sam's nickel...

21:11.520 --> 21:15.773
...because he was also strafing
German troop trains at the time.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.024
However...

21:58.984 --> 22:00.609
Okay, here we go.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.946
I am Jabba's prisoner.
And you...

22:04.614 --> 22:07.116
...have a really weird look
on your face.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.743
What? Honey, what is it?

22:08.910 --> 22:10.411
Did I get the hair wrong?

22:10.579 --> 22:13.039
Or what? Did you just
picture it differently? What?

22:13.248 --> 22:17.043
No, no. It's, um...
It's not you. It's, um...

22:21.882 --> 22:26.052
What is it? Come on, sweetie.
You're, like, freaking me out here.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.307
I hate Chandler.
The bastard ruined my life!
