10:43.667 --> 10:44.834
THAT'S WHAT I READ.

10:44.868 --> 10:46.267
WELL, I HAVE
A FOUNDATION,

10:46.299 --> 10:48.067
AND WE'RE
DOING RESEARCH

10:48.100 --> 10:49.234
ON WHERE BREAST CANCER STARTS,

10:49.267 --> 10:51.533
WHICH IS IN THE LINING
OF THE MILK DUCTS,

10:51.567 --> 10:52.634
AND WE HAVE A DEVICE

10:52.667 --> 10:54.200
WHERE WE CAN GET INTO
THE MILK DUCT,

10:54.234 --> 10:56.299
AND SQUIRT A VERY LOW DOSE
OF CHEMOTHERAPY

10:56.334 --> 10:59.033
RIGHT WHERE
THE TUMOR IS,

10:59.067 --> 11:00.000
AND TREAT THE TUMOR.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.766
PRE-CANCEROUS, TOO.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.633
SO I'M HOPING THIS WON'T
ONLY CURE BREAST CANCER,

11:03.666 --> 11:06.367
BUT MAY EVEN BE A WAY
OF PREVENTING IT ALTOGETHER.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.067
GOD, THAT'S AMAZING.

11:08.099 --> 11:08.868
WOW.

11:08.900 --> 11:09.734
WE'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN ABLE

11:09.766 --> 11:10.968
TO PREVENT IT
IN RATS.

11:11.067 --> 11:12.601
WE'VE GIVEN
THIS LOW-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY

11:12.634 --> 11:13.833
TO RATS,

11:13.868 --> 11:15.199
AND THEN GIVEN THEM
A CARCINOGEN

11:15.234 --> 11:17.434
AND PREVENTED THEM
FROM GETTING BREAST CANCER.

11:17.466 --> 11:18.634
SO WE'RE VERY CLOSE.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.501

11:20.533 --> 11:22.067
I WANT TO HELP.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.634

11:24.734 --> 11:26.167
WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

11:26.199 --> 11:28.833

REALLY.

11:28.867 --> 11:32.667
