00:57.558 --> 00:58.518
Am I interrupting?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.561
Oh. Enid.

01:00.770 --> 01:02.564
Mrs. Jones.
Of course not.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.105
I-I brought flowers.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.692
For your office.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.861
Well, you certainly
didn't need to do that.

01:08.069 --> 01:09.445
They're blue salvias.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.489
I thought they might add
a feminine touch.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.492
Well, um...

01:19.998 --> 01:21.540
They certainly will.

01:25.128 --> 01:27.004
You forgot, didn't you?

01:27.629 --> 01:29.716
- Forgot?
- Our walk.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.049
Oh.

01:31.843 --> 01:34.304
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I got wrapped up in work.

01:34.512 --> 01:37.973
An-- Never mind all that.
A walk would be lovely.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.106
Oh, my.

01:46.316 --> 01:47.984
That doesn't sound good,
does it?

01:48.192 --> 01:50.903
No.
No, it doesn't.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.198
There! That tone!
I will not take that tone!

01:54.406 --> 01:55.950
George, is everything all right?

01:56.158 --> 01:58.368
Sir.
It's Mrs. Brackenreid.

01:58.578 --> 01:59.912
She stopped by to have a word
with the inspector.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.831
Apparently,
he's been very surly of late.

02:02.040 --> 02:02.915
More than usual?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.293
Mm. She seems to think
it has to do with his drinking.

02:05.501 --> 02:08.002
George,
have you been eavesdropping?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.838
It's not very difficult.

02:10.048 --> 02:12.175
Besides, I have
remarkable hearing.

02:15.637 --> 02:18.556
I won't stand for lies, Thomas,
if you are drinking again.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.307
Have you smelled it
on my breath, Margaret?

02:20.516 --> 02:22.852
Have you seen me swallow
as much as a drop of alcohol?

02:23.061 --> 02:25.813
No, but the Temperance League
says there are other signs.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.649
There you go again
with the Temperance League.

02:27.856 --> 02:32.820
Led by the notorious convicted murderer
Levi Beecher, no less.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.281
And there you go again,
throwing it in my face.

02:35.490 --> 02:36.865
At least they're making
an effort.

02:37.074 --> 02:40.411
You don't like my drinking,
my mood, my job.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.206
For Christ's sakes, woman,
what do you like about me?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.998
I don't know anymore.

02:46.459 --> 02:49.378
Well, that's bleeding honest
of you.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.463
I think it's best
that you don't come home.

02:51.673 --> 02:53.966
I'll send
some of your things around.

02:59.848 --> 03:00.848
Good day, Detective.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.558
Mrs. Brackenreid.

03:05.562 --> 03:07.145
Crabtree, have you got
that station report?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.772
Uh, just a few moments, sir.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.817
I don't want any bloody excuses!

03:11.025 --> 03:13.527
Uh, sir, word's just come in.
A body's been found.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.112
Murdoch, you take that.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.907
Well, what are you all
gauping at?!

03:21.034 --> 03:22.662
I'm afraid our walk
will have to wait.

03:22.871 --> 03:24.204
Perhaps later?

03:24.413 --> 03:25.581
It's a date.

03:25.789 --> 03:29.127
And I can assure you,
this time I will not forget.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.588
George.

03:32.796 --> 03:33.715
Sir.

03:33.923 --> 03:36.884
Apparently, this chap walking
his dog discovered the body.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.219
There's nothing identifying
on her person.

03:39.429 --> 03:40.305
Hm.

03:40.513 --> 03:42.098
Very remote area.

03:42.307 --> 03:43.807
I wonder what she was doing here.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.603
Well, It would seem, sir,
she wanted to be alone,

03:46.811 --> 03:48.646
to take her own life.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.028
I'm not so sure
about that, George.

03:58.698 --> 04:02.659
Those lacerations to her wrist seem
quite deep for a suicide.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.455
And further,
they're even and steady.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.581
If these wounds
were self-inflicted,

04:07.789 --> 04:09.250
they would be far more jagged.

04:09.459 --> 04:11.044
Murder, then?

04:11.711 --> 04:13.295
So it would seem.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.048
There's no sign of a struggle.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.259
The question is,

04:18.468 --> 04:21.971
why would this young woman
let someone cut her wrists?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.771
I agree with your observations,
Detective.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.939
These wounds
were not self-inflicted.

04:32.148 --> 04:35.067
Whoever did this to her
was methodical and cold.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.321
But why would she not struggle?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.822
There is light bruising
on her neck,

04:41.031 --> 04:42.492
suggesting she was choked.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.742
Not long enough to kill her --

04:43.951 --> 04:46.579
But long enough
to render her unconscious.

04:46.788 --> 04:49.415
I'll deliver a full report
to the station.

04:49.624 --> 04:53.711
When you come, I wonder
if you might do me a favor.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.338
I'm not sure
what my schedule is like.

04:56.547 --> 04:59.132
It's not for me personally.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.805
Inspector Brackenreid's behavior
has been a bit odd as of late.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.848
I wonder if you could give
your opinion.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.185
Well, yes, of course.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.437
Oh.
This is interesting.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.983
This woman has a callus
on her right index finger.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.490
I think
she was a telegraph operator.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.076
Oh.
Why would you think that?

05:26.285 --> 05:27.495
Enid...

05:28.829 --> 05:31.915
Mrs. Jones has a similar callus
on her index finger

05:32.125 --> 05:34.002
from repeatedly
tapping out code.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.129
Ah.
I see.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.382
Lucky for us
that you know her so well.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.268
Mr. Ryder, Great North Western

05:50.475 --> 05:52.978
is the fifth telegraph company
I've checked with.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.771
I was hoping
you might be able to tell me

05:54.980 --> 05:56.983
the identity
of this young woman.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.904
Oh, no. This is --
This is Veronica Williams.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.242
She missed her shift today.

06:06.451 --> 06:07.535
Williams.

06:07.744 --> 06:10.747
She was found murdered
this morning.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.458
Miss Williams was a lovely girl.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.918
Do you know of anyone
who might have wanted to harm her?

06:16.127 --> 06:17.920
No. Sorry.

06:18.129 --> 06:19.422
I don't know
if this means anything,

06:19.629 --> 06:22.132
but she was a little
out of sorts last week.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.802
Oh? Do you have any idea
what might have been troubling her?

06:25.011 --> 06:27.512
Not at all.
But Miss Tipton might.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.389
They were friends.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.894
Beth.

06:33.101 --> 06:33.810
Yes, Mr. Ryder.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.021
Beth Tipton,
this is Detective Murdoch.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.731
Miss Tipton.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.151
I take it you knew
Veronica Williams.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.403
Of course.
Ronnie's a dear.

06:42.612 --> 06:43.862
Something wrong?

06:45.990 --> 06:47.574
You have to forgive me.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.036
We'd become quite close.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.079
I understand something

06:51.286 --> 06:53.497
had been troubling
Miss Williams recently.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.334
This is a bit awkward, Detective.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.504
You can be assured
of my discretion.

07:02.005 --> 07:06.677
Ronnie was corresponding with someone
on the telegraph lines.

07:06.886 --> 07:08.346
A man.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.223
Do you know who he was?

07:10.430 --> 07:13.141
No.
But I know he made her happy.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.435
At first.

07:15.019 --> 07:15.937
At first?

07:16.144 --> 07:18.773
Ronnie mentioned
that they'd had a disagreement.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.233
Do you know what it was about?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.317
I don't know.

07:21.526 --> 07:23.151
Ronnie was quite private.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.694
But all incoming messages

07:24.903 --> 07:27.447
are automatically printed off
and put on file.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.408
I could get Ronnie's
if you'd like.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.370
Well, that would be
most appreciated.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.918
Crabtree.
A word.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.673
I suppose you heard the missus
carrying on this morning.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.134
Well, for the most part, sir,
I only heard you.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.593
I have remarkably good hearing.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.555
Then you'll know that I've been
abstaining from alcohol.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.682
That's very admirable, sir.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.144
Yes.
Well, it has been difficult.

07:56.351 --> 08:00.564
Soto ease the burden,
I've been prescribed a Gold Cure.

08:00.773 --> 08:01.983
That sounds very exotic.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.192
Bloody expensive is what it is.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.487
Usually I have it delivered
to the house.

08:06.696 --> 08:08.531
But no doubt, you'll be
having it delivered here.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.615
Precisely.

08:09.824 --> 08:12.617
So as soon as it arrives,
I want you to bring it to me.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.536
Sir, consider it in your hands.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.622
And, Crabtree,
keep this under your hat.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.543
This is just between you and me.
Understood?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.420
- Understood, sir.
- Good lad.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.382
Ah, sir, might I have a word
about the Williams case?

08:26.591 --> 08:27.632
What of it?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.384
Well, sir, it seems the victim
was quite upset

08:29.593 --> 08:31.596
about something that occurred
over the telegraph lines.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.389
So find out what it was.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.140
Well, it's not that simple.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.350
You see, I have
all of her correspondence.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.394
Unfortunately,
it's written in Morse code.

08:39.604 --> 08:40.730
It could take days to decipher.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.274
- Well, that won't do, will it?
- No, sir.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.567
That's why I was thinking

08:44.774 --> 08:47.028
of bringing in a telegrapher
to assist me.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.111
Fine, Murdoch.

08:48.321 --> 08:49.322
Do you have someone in mind,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.698
or do you want me to figure
that one out for you as well?

08:51.908 --> 08:53.283
No, sir.
I have someone in...

08:54.034 --> 08:54.951
...mind.

08:58.873 --> 09:00.374
These messages are so personal.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.500
I-It's like I'm snooping
through her diary.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.378
It could help
to capture a killer.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.129
I'm not even sure
that I belong here.

09:06.339 --> 09:08.673
I haven't worked
at Great North Western in some time.

09:08.883 --> 09:11.802
Enid, I know you've kept up your codes
and telegraphy skills.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.346
But more importantly,
I trust you.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.849
And that's a tremendous help.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.183
It is?

09:19.726 --> 09:23.813
Well, it might be fascinating
to see you at work.

09:33.157 --> 09:34.491
Shall we start with this one?

09:36.744 --> 09:38.287
This one.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.582
Oh, bloody hell. Go away!

09:42.792 --> 09:43.960
Inspector, are you all right?

09:44.168 --> 09:44.961
Oh, Doctor.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.962
Uh, is there something I can do for you?

09:47.171 --> 09:49.590
I've finished the postmortem
on Veronica Williams.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.801
I thought you'd want
the results right away.

09:52.009 --> 09:52.969
Give it to Murdoch.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.761
Inspector, are you sure
you're all right?

09:54.971 --> 09:57.389
If not,
my morgue is always open.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.600
Doctor, your attempts at humor
are always charming.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.394
And thank you for your offer,
but, no, thank you.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.937
Now, goodbye.

10:14.532 --> 10:19.495
"How the attentions...
of such a charming creature

10:19.703 --> 10:23.291
could be directed to me,
I know not.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.708
Signed A.K."

10:24.917 --> 10:27.043
This fellow is quite
the slick wordsmith.

10:27.253 --> 10:28.796
I might need to make note
of his prose.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.255
Oh, here's another one.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.841
"I would yield everything...

10:33.801 --> 10:37.804
...just to have the means
to see your face just once.

10:38.014 --> 10:39.849
Signed A.K."

10:40.057 --> 10:42.143
Clearly, whoever this A.K. is,

10:42.350 --> 10:43.811
he and Miss Williams
were having a love affair.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.270
Over the telegraph wires?

10:45.479 --> 10:46.855
- It's surprisingly common.
- Really?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.317
Telegraphy can be quite lonely.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.527
To pass the time,
telegraphers will chitchat

10:51.735 --> 10:52.653
and gossip over the wire.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.280
Some even play games,
like checkers or chess.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.616
And some, like Miss Williams,
form romantic attachments.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.287
But wouldn't an affair
be the talk of the office?

11:01.495 --> 11:02.955
No.
Not at all.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.664
If I could just
draw you a diagram,

11:04.874 --> 11:06.417
it'd be easier
for me to explain.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.376
Yes.
Of course.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.465
Well...

11:13.423 --> 11:16.552
...it's similar to the spokes
on a bicycle.

11:17.345 --> 11:20.347
Telegraph signals travel
over many different lines,

11:20.556 --> 11:22.725
but they intersect
at very few hubs.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.476
Forming a network
of communication.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.144
Yes.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.062
And telegraphers can listen in

11:27.270 --> 11:29.690
to as many different transmissions
as they like,

11:29.899 --> 11:30.607
from anywhere.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.067
Or participate in them.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.695
Well, then how can we find
this A.K.?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.572
I mean, look at this.
It's -- It's a web.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.947
He could be anywhere
in the city.

11:38.157 --> 11:40.408
For that matter,
this could be worldwide.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.577
Fortunately,
while every single transmission

11:42.787 --> 11:43.703
is sent in Morse code,

11:43.913 --> 11:46.749
each company has
their own unique code.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.460
It's for reasons of privacy.

11:49.668 --> 11:53.338
So, would this A.K. have used
one of those unique codes?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.466
He most certainly did.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.427
Ah.
So, what company was involved?

11:58.635 --> 12:01.471
I'm sorry, Detective.
No one here has the initials A.K.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.639
Are you sure?

12:02.847 --> 12:03.932
Quite.

12:04.682 --> 12:08.437
However, there was a K.A.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.938
Kingsley Adams.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.400
But I had to terminate his employment
about four weeks ago.

12:13.609 --> 12:14.985
Oh?
For what reason?

12:15.193 --> 12:17.863
I caught him socializing
over the lines.

12:18.072 --> 12:21.826
George, I'll need you to locate
this Kingsley Adams immediately.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.661
I'll get the men on it, sir.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.248
Mr. Ryder, I'll need to examine
all of the incoming messages

12:27.456 --> 12:28.706
sent to Mr. Adams.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.465
What's so funny, lads?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.384
Oh, nothing at all, sir.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.096
Nothing at all.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.764
Do you expect me
to believe that?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.390
We're just having a laugh, sir.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.225
Oh, I bet you were.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.061
I bet you thought
it was quite funny,

12:49.269 --> 12:51.230
my wife coming here
and carrying on like she did.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.649
No, sir.
Nobody found that funny at all.

12:54.232 --> 12:57.861
You're probably taking her side.
Thinking that I drink too much.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.407
Sir, that's your private affair.
We would never.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.659
She doesn't appreciate
all that I do for her.

13:04.869 --> 13:06.035
She thinks I'm useless.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.580
Oh, sir, I'm sure
she didn't mean that.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.038
Eh?

13:11.167 --> 13:13.668
What do you know about it, Crabtree?

13:13.878 --> 13:15.211
Have you been speaking
to my wife?

13:15.421 --> 13:16.254
No, sir.
Of course not.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.966
If I find that any of you lot has been
speaking to my wife...

13:19.174 --> 13:20.634
- ...behind my back --
- Sir.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.471
I swear to you, no one here
has spoken to your wife.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.309
Of course not.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.312
Carry on, lads.

13:35.441 --> 13:38.360
You're all so serious.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.782
If he carries on like that,
there'll be a mutiny for sure.

13:45.618 --> 13:46.911
George.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.288
Have we any information
on Mr. Adams' whereabouts?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.206
Sir, we've checked his home,
his neighborhood,

13:51.414 --> 13:53.625
even other telegraph companies
to see if one has employed him,

13:53.834 --> 13:54.876
but there's no sign.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.336
He seems to have vanished.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.297
George, one doesn't
simply vanish.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.590
Keep looking.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.091
Yes, sir.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.971
How goes it
with Mr. Adams' communications?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.347
Quite interesting.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.307
So many of the messages
sent to Kingsley

14:09.517 --> 14:12.561
were romantic, sweet,
even salacious.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.313
So he and Miss Williams
were deeply involved?

14:15.523 --> 14:16.774
Well, yes.

14:16.981 --> 14:22.571
But not all of the messages sent
were from Veronica.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.864
Another woman?

14:24.990 --> 14:28.201
Perhaps this was some bizarre
love triangle gone wrong.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.620
I'll have her
brought in immediately.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.703
Do you know who she is?

14:30.913 --> 14:34.707
Actually, it might not be
quite that simple, William.

14:47.388 --> 14:49.764
That's 13 so far.

14:49.974 --> 14:52.308
This Mr. Adams
was quite the lothario.

14:52.518 --> 14:53.686
Indeed.

14:53.894 --> 14:57.398
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,
eh, Murdoch?

14:57.605 --> 14:59.817
Apparently not, sir.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.033
With looking after mother,
I have no time for myself.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.076
She's bedridden.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.745
And since he just lost
<i>his</i> mother,

15:12.955 --> 15:15.791
he understood exactly
what I was going through.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.710
No, his mother is still alive.

15:17.918 --> 15:18.961
He lives with her.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.962
I see. And how often
did you say you were in touch?

15:21.171 --> 15:23.256
At least three times a week.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.759
We share such a devotion
to rescuing birds.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.385
He's building me an aviary,

15:27.595 --> 15:31.097
which we laughed about,
because his name is Avery.

15:31.307 --> 15:33.933
No, actually, it's not.
His name is Kingsley Adams.

15:34.143 --> 15:36.269
Kingsley Adams?

15:36.812 --> 15:38.480
But I work with him.

15:38.688 --> 15:39.815
Here in Toronto.

15:40.024 --> 15:41.191
Yes, I know.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.234
Kingsley?

15:42.442 --> 15:46.404
He's paunchy and pale,
like dough.

15:46.614 --> 15:47.822
And very shy.

15:48.032 --> 15:50.366
Miss Tipton,
A.K. communicated with you

15:50.576 --> 15:52.452
in Great North Western code.

15:53.495 --> 15:56.789
Did you never suspect
that it was Kingsley Adams?

15:56.999 --> 15:59.500
No. Never.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.796
There are over 160
Great North Western employees

16:03.004 --> 16:03.880
in three offices.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.798
And that's just Toronto.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.885
Besides, Kingsley
said he was from Ottawa.

16:09.094 --> 16:13.139
I...I had no reason
to disbelieve him.

16:13.349 --> 16:15.808
So you never actually met him
face-to-face?

16:16.018 --> 16:17.311
But only because
he's in Buffalo.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.562
I don't understand.

16:19.772 --> 16:21.856
If he's from Toronto,
then why in the world

16:22.066 --> 16:23.984
would he borrow money
to travel to see me?

16:24.192 --> 16:27.278
I knew something wasn't right
when he asked for the money.

16:27.488 --> 16:29.782
Yet you gave it to him?

16:30.615 --> 16:32.701
And you never
heard from him again.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.452
No.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.621
I didn't.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.125
This is all so embarrassing.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.880
All of us duped
by that pitiful creature.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.801
We were just a bunch
of lonely fools.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.477
Beth?

16:59.687 --> 17:00.687
Beth Tipton?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.773
Enid Jones!

17:02.980 --> 17:04.817
Are you working
for the police force now?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.652
Oh, heavens, no.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.278
But you're still
with Great North Western?

17:08.487 --> 17:09.153
I am.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.655
Oh, dear.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.531
- Kingsley Adams didn't --
- No.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.160
I'm only here to help translate
some telegraphic messages.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.327
Oh.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.747
It's all so humiliating.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.125
It's good to see
that you're doing so well.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.836
How is Alwyn?
He must be 9 by now.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.002
He's very well.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.133
We're living on our own,
making ends meet.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.801
And are you involved
with anyone?

17:32.552 --> 17:33.804
Perhaps.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.556
I should get back
to my translating.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.932
Oh, of course.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.224
It was good to see you.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.643
Bye.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.773
So, this Adams,

17:45.982 --> 17:49.444
he seduces several women,
earns their trust,

17:49.653 --> 17:51.154
and then starts asking
for money.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.031
He bilked many of them
out of their life savings.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.242
But why go from fraud to murder?

17:56.451 --> 17:57.368
Maybe he slipped up

17:57.577 --> 17:59.496
and Miss Williams
caught him in his lies.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.330
Now he's up and disappeared.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.416
So how are we supposed
to catch the bugger?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.586
He doesn't know
we're onto him yet.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.086
So?

18:08.505 --> 18:10.715
Maybe we should meet him
where he's most comfortable.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.176
On the telegraph lines.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.931
Aren't you just being
a little bit stupid?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.099
He's not going to answer
to a copper, is he?

18:20.308 --> 18:22.685
No, sir.
Not a copper.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.189
I propose we lure Mr. Adams out

18:25.396 --> 18:27.775
by creating
the perfect female target.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.567
Wouldn't that be very dangerous
for her, sir?

18:29.777 --> 18:31.236
She's not gonna be real, Crabtree.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.529
She's only gonna exist
over the telegraph wires.

18:33.739 --> 18:34.698
Right, then.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.491
Let's make a list
of her qualities.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.242
Uh, very attractive.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.661
He's not going to see her.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.039
Well, there's no harm
in her sounding attractive.

18:43.248 --> 18:46.794
Well, in that case,
I like a woman with spunk.

18:47.001 --> 18:47.836
Spunk.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.963
I think a combination
of domesticity and career.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.758
Independent,
yet not selfishly so.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.050
Independent.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.094
A woman who gives you
a little bit of trouble

18:56.302 --> 18:58.430
every now and again,
keeps things interesting.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.642
Someone you feel at ease with,
yet challenges you.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.434
A woman with strong hips.

19:03.644 --> 19:04.519
An intellectual.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.855
- A woman with large --
- Sir, I'm sure that's enough.

19:08.065 --> 19:09.942
Right, then. I suppose
we should give her a name.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.276
How about Molly?

19:11.859 --> 19:14.613
Sounds sweet,
yet still a little saucy.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.989
Fine.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.450
Who is going to play Molly?

19:27.041 --> 19:28.376
So, Molly.

19:28.585 --> 19:29.670
What's the holdup?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.128
Taking a long time, isn't it?

19:31.337 --> 19:33.257
We did have to wire in
this portable telegraph, sir.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.634
Yes. Well, it's here now,
so let's get cracking.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.344
Will he even hear us?

19:37.552 --> 19:39.887
If Mr. Adams is out there,
he'll hear us, Inspector.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.222
So, how do we do this?

19:41.431 --> 19:43.182
We'll just send out a hello
over the lines

19:43.392 --> 19:45.102
and see if we can grab
anyone's attention.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.815
Try, "Hello, my name is Molly.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.817
I'm new to Toronto.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.484
Such a big city."

19:53.693 --> 19:55.403
No, no, no.
You have to do better than that.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.574
Say, "I've been looking
for a good teahouse.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.325
Does anyone have a suggestion?"

20:12.336 --> 20:14.589
Well, it's obviously
not going to work, is it?

20:14.798 --> 20:16.465
Patience, sir.
Patience.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.761
What are they saying?

20:20.971 --> 20:23.765
It's someone
claiming to be a young man.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.978
He suggests... Mary's...

20:28.185 --> 20:30.564
on... Arbor Street.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.151
His signature is T.S.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.693
This could take forever.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.698
Is he always so impatient?

20:39.906 --> 20:43.201
This is exceptional,
even for him.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.287
Yes. No, sir.
Trust me, please.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.622
You need to give me the package.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.458
I appreciate that very much,
but I have explicit orders.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.584
Thank you.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.336
Constable?

20:52.544 --> 20:53.711
Who was that gentleman?

20:53.921 --> 20:55.255
Uh, just -- just a deliveryman.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.339
It's most curious.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.759
I believe he's also an attendant
at Toronto General Hospital.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.009
- Oh?
- Who is the package for?

21:00.218 --> 21:01.761
- The inspector.
- Is he ill?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.012
I'm not really at liberty
to say.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.891
I see, but if the package
was delivered by an attendant,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.558
then it must be medicinal.

21:07.768 --> 21:09.353
I-I suppose that makes sense.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.229
I wonder
if it would also make sense

21:11.438 --> 21:13.856
that the attendant was meant
to administer the medicine.

21:14.066 --> 21:15.150
- Why would that be?
- Otherwise...

21:15.358 --> 21:17.109
...why not simply send
a delivery boy?

21:17.318 --> 21:18.194
Well...

21:18.403 --> 21:20.321
And furthermore, since you
sent the attendant away,

21:20.529 --> 21:22.406
the inspector's not going to be able
to take his medicine,

21:22.615 --> 21:24.159
now, is he?

21:24.367 --> 21:25.493
Yes, I see.

21:26.577 --> 21:27.788
Perhaps given
my medical experience,

21:27.996 --> 21:29.038
I should take the package in.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.289
Um...

21:30.499 --> 21:32.291
Yes. Yes, I suppose
that would be for the beat.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.294
Of course it would be.

21:43.929 --> 21:44.846
Inspector.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.015
Doctor, I'm, uh,
quite busy at the moment.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.977
What are you doing with that?

21:50.184 --> 21:51.269
- Where's --
- The attendant?

21:51.478 --> 21:53.355
I'm afraid Constable Crabtree
sent him away.

21:53.563 --> 21:57.317
What?! The bloody dimwit can't follow
even simple instructions.

21:57.526 --> 21:58.902
Inspector, what is going on?

21:59.694 --> 22:02.321
It's only an injection I'm taking.
The Keeley Gold Cure.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.657
I've heard of it.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.410
For alcohol cravings?

22:06.993 --> 22:09.246
This is absolutely
none of your business.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.415
Yes, I suppose not,
but you are going to need someone

22:12.624 --> 22:13.834
to administer the injection.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.335
Oh, no, no, no.

22:15.544 --> 22:16.711
It'll be a cold day in hell

22:16.920 --> 22:18.672
before any woman
other than the wife

22:18.880 --> 22:20.548
comes anywhere
near my backside, love.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.925
Well, if not me, you'll be needing
much longer arms.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.679
We'll see about that.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.097
Murdoch!

22:30.767 --> 22:33.144
You're a good man, Murdoch.
A man to ride the river with.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.688
I'm glad
you're feeling better, sir.

22:34.895 --> 22:35.896
Much better.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.942
Higgins!
Put the kettle on!

22:40.693 --> 22:41.862
The inspector's Gold Cure

22:42.069 --> 22:43.613
certainly seems to perform miracles.

22:43.822 --> 22:44.905
Doesn't it?

22:45.115 --> 22:47.451
He must be suffering terribly
from alcohol withdrawal.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.660
Indeed.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.744
Detective Murdoch!

22:49.952 --> 22:50.996
It's A.K.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.330
He's attempting
to contact Molly.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.875
I must attend to this.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.085
Of course.

22:57.294 --> 22:59.211
But I would continue
to keep an eye on him, William.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.588
Yes.
Of course.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.428
I was just saying
that Molly was new to the city

23:06.635 --> 23:08.888
when he asked me
how I liked Toronto.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.390
Shall I ask him where he is?

23:10.598 --> 23:11.932
No, no.
Not too soon.

23:12.142 --> 23:13.727
We don't want to risk
scaring him off.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.311
Um...

23:15.519 --> 23:22.068
Tell him, "I was hoping the city
would offer more adventures."

23:28.657 --> 23:30.618
He says...

23:31.869 --> 23:34.413
"Molly will find adventure."

23:35.207 --> 23:37.084
He's fond of adventure, too.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.960
Your answer.

23:39.669 --> 23:40.503
I'm thinking.

23:40.711 --> 23:41.755
You have to answer quickly,

23:41.962 --> 23:44.007
or he might lose interest
in the conversation.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.842
Um...

23:46.050 --> 23:47.927
"What kind of adventures?"

23:53.391 --> 23:56.728
"One... that involves...

23:56.936 --> 24:01.232
a certain young woman."

24:03.567 --> 24:05.237
Oh, my.
This sounds familiar.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.866
"How the attentions
of such a charming creature

24:11.076 --> 24:14.121
could be directed to me,
I know not."

24:14.328 --> 24:15.663
Ha!

24:15.872 --> 24:18.666
"What do you want to know
about me?"

24:25.214 --> 24:26.423
"Everything.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.304
Are you... married?"

24:33.890 --> 24:35.599
Detective.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.560
"I was...

24:37.769 --> 24:40.438
but my husband has passed."

24:49.489 --> 24:53.076
"I am sorry."

24:53.285 --> 24:57.372
"But he left me with a son."

24:58.707 --> 25:00.040
Enid, please.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.625
We mustn't lose him.

25:11.928 --> 25:15.307
"I... would...

25:15.515 --> 25:19.394
like... to...

25:19.603 --> 25:23.147
meet him... one day."

25:25.817 --> 25:28.319
He says he must go
but hopes to talk later.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.363
Excellent.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.240
Might I have a word with you?
In private.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.786
Yes.
Of course.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.125
That was most successful.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.876
William, I would rather
that you did not use

25:44.085 --> 25:46.337
my personal information.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.757
A quick decision had to be made.
You said so yourself.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.675
Bringing up my dead husband
in front of your constables --

25:51.884 --> 25:54.386
It was most uncomfortable.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.265
But the idea that this killer
knows that I have a son.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.268
There's no way
he can know it's Alwyn.

26:00.477 --> 26:03.145
Alwyn is everything to me.

26:03.355 --> 26:06.441
And I would do anything
to protect him.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.903
I apologize.

26:11.112 --> 26:13.530
My actions were inappropriate.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.201
Sir, another body
has been found.

26:16.409 --> 26:17.661
Interestingly,
just a short distance

26:17.868 --> 26:20.163
from where we discovered
Miss Williams.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.460
Please excuse me, Mrs. Jones.

26:33.300 --> 26:37.180
A young couple
met for a rendezvous.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.891
They thought the stench
was a dead animal.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.894
Instead, they found this.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.396
Here.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.106
- Hmm?
- Camphor.

26:47.315 --> 26:49.150
Rub it on your lip
to mask the odor.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.376
We may have a serious problem, George.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.006
Kingsley Adams.

27:11.881 --> 27:14.592
Sir, clearly, this body
has been here for some time.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.260
If this is Kingsley Adams,
then how --

27:16.469 --> 27:18.012
How could he have been telegraphing me

27:18.221 --> 27:19.306
only minutes ago?

27:20.682 --> 27:23.559
An excellent question indeed.

27:32.402 --> 27:33.944
This is definitely
Kingsley Adams.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.864
His dental records confirm it.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.449
And given the state
of decomposition --

27:37.656 --> 27:38.657
He's been dead so long,

27:38.866 --> 27:41.536
he couldn't have murdered
Veronica Williams.

27:41.744 --> 27:42.787
Have you a cause of death?

27:42.996 --> 27:44.122
Blunt-force trauma.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.499
His temporal bone was shattered.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.251
His body was found
at a known lovers' rendezvous.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.962
Perhaps he was meeting
one of his young ladies there,

27:52.172 --> 27:54.632
one who'd become upset
with his misrepresentations.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.720
I don't understand
this new form of courting.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.262
Over telegraph lines?

28:00.846 --> 28:02.973
Many people become engaged
through letter writing.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.477
But this seems
so much more impersonal.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.978
Yes.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.730
I'm a fan of chemistry myself.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.606
The way a person smells,

28:10.815 --> 28:13.777
the effect they have on you
when you're around them.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.326
Julia?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.163
Yes?

28:25.372 --> 28:28.165
I said, can you tell me
when you think he might have died?

28:29.459 --> 28:31.920
Oh, yes.
Um, of course.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.297
I believe he's been dead
roughly three weeks.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.048
Three weeks.

28:36.257 --> 28:37.549
Most interesting.

28:38.343 --> 28:39.760
Thank you, Doctor.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.554
Three weeks.
That's significant.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.472
That's significant
because Kingsley Adams

28:43.681 --> 28:45.933
was -- was -- was...

28:46.518 --> 28:49.061
He was murdered
approximately three weeks ago.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.146
And he was fired from his job
four weeks ago.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.941
Right. Right.
But there's something else.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.692
Something that I just can't quite grasp.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.737
Well, during that time,
It seems he went from Casanova

28:57.945 --> 28:59.614
to fraudulent charlatan.

28:59.823 --> 29:01.574
Yes.
Personality change.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.118
Good observation, Crabtree.
Well done. Like that.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.746
It would suggest that someone murdered
Kingsley Adams

29:06.954 --> 29:09.249
and assumed his identity
over the telegraph lines.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.375
Tragic.
But why do that?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.421
To use his intimate relationships
with women

29:14.628 --> 29:15.838
to cheat them out
of their money.

29:16.047 --> 29:17.464
Which they happily gave him.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.174
It's most cruel, really.

29:19.384 --> 29:20.676
This bugger needs sorting out.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.636
So, how do I get my hands
on him?

29:22.846 --> 29:24.638
We know for certain
he's a telegrapher.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.974
- As were the two murder victims.
- Didn't they work together?

29:27.182 --> 29:28.393
Same company,
something like that?

29:28.601 --> 29:31.145
Yes, they did, until he was dismissed
for socializing.

29:31.354 --> 29:33.230
With that Williams woman.
Amongst others.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.192
Perhaps we're still looking
at a love triangle.

29:36.401 --> 29:37.443
But, sir, we've already spoken

29:37.652 --> 29:39.945
with all of Mr. Adams' conquests.

29:40.154 --> 29:42.240
Actually, I wasn't thinking
of Mr. Adams.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.490
Good.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.326
Good.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.208
Miss Tipton,
was Miss Williams involved

29:52.416 --> 29:54.669
with anyone other
than Kingsley Adams?

29:54.877 --> 29:56.003
No, I...

29:57.046 --> 29:58.589
I don't think so.

29:58.798 --> 30:03.303
Miss Tipton, are you
withholding something from me?

30:04.511 --> 30:08.724
I once saw -- well, peeked --

30:08.932 --> 30:11.227
at some of Ronnie's
incoming messages.

30:11.435 --> 30:14.230
It seems she had become involved
with another man

30:14.439 --> 30:16.148
over the telegraph lines.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.609
Why did you not tell me
of this before?

30:18.817 --> 30:21.112
Well, I didn't want
to get into any trouble.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.199
Trouble?
Why would you get into trouble?

30:25.074 --> 30:27.826
Because, Detective,
this other man was my employer.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.623
Frankly, I'm offended
at the insinuation

30:31.830 --> 30:33.540
that I may have had something
to do with either Mr. Adams'

30:33.750 --> 30:35.210
or Miss Williams' death.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.462
But you do admit you were involved
with Miss Williams?

30:39.506 --> 30:41.883
But only
over the telegraph lines.

30:42.090 --> 30:42.967
I couldn't help myself.

30:43.175 --> 30:46.386
She was quite... eager.

30:46.930 --> 30:49.223
Why didn't you mention this before?

30:49.432 --> 30:52.727
As you know, I've dismissed people
for such dalliances.

30:52.935 --> 30:54.729
I couldn't be seen
as hypocritical.

30:55.896 --> 30:59.526
But there is something
so alluring

30:59.733 --> 31:02.111
about telegraphic romance.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.613
How so?

31:04.196 --> 31:06.699
One can be bolder.

31:06.907 --> 31:10.369
More... explicit.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.622
Perhaps when you learned
Miss Williams

31:12.829 --> 31:15.250
was having a bolder,
more explicit relationship

31:15.458 --> 31:19.170
with Kingsley Adams,
you made him pay with his life.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.756
I did no such thing.

31:23.007 --> 31:24.592
Where were you three weeks ago?

31:24.800 --> 31:28.054
In Hamilton, helping my brother
and his new bride move.

31:28.262 --> 31:29.096
I took a week from work,

31:29.305 --> 31:34.644
so if that's when Adams was killed,
I couldn't have done it.

31:35.228 --> 31:36.938
We'll be checking into that.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.606
I advise that you do.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.528
What do you mean you couldn't find
anything on Ryder?

31:43.736 --> 31:45.904
Well, his alibi checks out, sir.

31:46.114 --> 31:47.365
Did I give you permission
to speak?

31:47.574 --> 31:49.616
- Uh, w-well, no.
- No!

31:49.826 --> 31:51.952
So keep your bloody trap shut, then!

31:52.703 --> 31:54.122
You're a disgrace,
the lot of you!

31:54.329 --> 31:56.958
Poor excuse for that uniform
you're wearing!

31:57.165 --> 31:59.836
Do I have to do everything around here
by myself?!

32:00.044 --> 32:02.255
Shift, Crabtree!

32:07.426 --> 32:09.345
Sir, might I have a word?

32:09.554 --> 32:10.805
Sir!

32:11.013 --> 32:11.888
Get your bloody hand off me.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.849
Sir, I think I'm speaking
for the rest of the men

32:14.057 --> 32:16.728
when I say that we're very concerned
about your behavior.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.480
- Sir!
- I said take your hand off.

32:19.689 --> 32:21.356
Sir, there's something wrong with you.

32:21.566 --> 32:23.108
Everybody knows it,
even your missus,

32:23.317 --> 32:25.193
but you refuse to --

32:47.008 --> 32:51.471
So, Doctor, this is what you
get up to down here, is it?

32:51.679 --> 32:53.597
Sometimes.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.933
This is a surprise, Inspector.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.019
Is there something
I can help you with?

32:59.228 --> 33:00.355
I believe there is.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.816
I've not been acting like myself
of late.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.568
There was an incident
between me and Crabtree.

33:06.778 --> 33:09.071
While he is
an annoying little so-and-so,

33:09.279 --> 33:10.490
he's not that annoying.

33:10.698 --> 33:12.575
- Is he all right?
- Yes, yes.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.161
The Gold Cure
that I've been taking --

33:15.369 --> 33:17.038
I think it's having
a strange effect on me.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.374
Yes. I've thought
the very same thing.

33:19.582 --> 33:21.625
- You have?
- Yes, since your shot.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.086
I was simply waiting
to confirm my observations.

33:24.671 --> 33:27.256
Well, there's no need
to wait any further.

33:27.464 --> 33:28.840
Would you like me to analyze it for you?

33:29.049 --> 33:30.468
I'd appreciate that.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.679
- Good day, Doctor.
- Good day.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.605
I don't know how you do it.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.481
How I do what?

33:44.691 --> 33:46.651
Gamble with people's lives.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.862
At least that's what
this feels like to me.

33:52.198 --> 33:55.660
Enid, I do what I have to
to capture a killer.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.959
- Is it him?
- Yes.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.210
What's he saying?

34:04.419 --> 34:05.836
He says he likes me.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.297
Molly.

34:08.505 --> 34:09.882
What should I tell him?

34:10.465 --> 34:13.135
Tell him what you have to.

34:14.387 --> 34:15.972
"I like you, too."

34:22.353 --> 34:26.898
He's asking if I'm involved
with anyone.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.320
"It's difficult to say.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.782
There is so much to consider

34:35.992 --> 34:39.746
when you have a young son
who needs a father."

34:46.210 --> 34:47.545
What is it?

34:47.753 --> 34:50.213
He says, "Ah, yes.
Alwyn."

34:50.797 --> 34:53.717
H-How does he know? How does --
How does he know Alwyn's name?

34:54.635 --> 34:56.094
You have to ask him.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.849
"How do you know his name?"

35:04.896 --> 35:08.315
He says I sound like someone
who used to work with him.

35:09.442 --> 35:11.652
Oh, my God.
He knows it's me.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.987
William, he knows it's me.

35:14.197 --> 35:16.239
You can't lose him.
Enid, please.

35:16.449 --> 35:17.992
You have to be strong.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.871
"I don't know what you mean."

35:28.126 --> 35:29.920
"It's not nice...

35:30.128 --> 35:32.215
to lie... Enid.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.050
Veronica lied to me.

35:34.884 --> 35:37.804
Beth lied to me."

35:39.304 --> 35:40.431
He's gone!

35:40.639 --> 35:43.768
He knows about Beth, me, Alwyn.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.561
- William!
- Nothing will happen to you.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.271
I'll send constables around

35:48.481 --> 35:49.981
to take care of Alwyn
straightaway.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.150
Where are you going?

35:52.360 --> 35:54.402
If anyone's in danger,
it's Beth Tipton.

35:54.612 --> 35:56.489
I'll be right back.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.615
Everything will be fine.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.389
We're too late, sir.

36:21.597 --> 36:23.391
So it would seem.

36:34.527 --> 36:36.987
Gabriel Ryder's walking stick.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.947
He was here, then.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.407
Yes.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.617
But more than that,

36:41.826 --> 36:45.246
Gabriel Ryder and Kingsley Adams
are one and the same.

36:52.003 --> 36:55.297
Listen up, lads.
This is Gabriel Ryder.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.632
He's suspected
of kidnapping Beth Tipton,

36:57.842 --> 36:59.342
and he's most likely a killer.

36:59.552 --> 37:02.679
I want this bastard caught
before he hurts this woman.

37:02.889 --> 37:03.889
Well, let's get a move on.

37:04.097 --> 37:07.393
Oh, and, gentlemen,
just to be clear --

37:07.601 --> 37:09.269
I've got total faith
in each and every one of you.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.480
Sirs, lads,
Ryder's house has been searched.

37:11.688 --> 37:14.150
She's not there. Also, he didn't return
to work this morning.

37:14.358 --> 37:15.192
What about Alwyn?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.652
Master Alwyn is safe, ma'am.
He's with a constable.

37:17.862 --> 37:20.572
- Thank goodness.
- Crabtree. A word.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.121
Thank you for agreeing to stay.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.166
Your help could prove to be invaluable.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.001
I'm doing this for Beth.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.170
Of course.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.507
About what happened.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.760
- It's all right, sir.
- No, it's not.

37:41.344 --> 37:43.762
And if you want to get me back,
that'd be all right.

37:43.971 --> 37:44.804
Get you back, sir?

37:45.014 --> 37:46.474
Go on.
Hit me.

37:46.681 --> 37:47.891
- Hit you?
- Hit me.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.018
No, sir.
It's really...

37:53.940 --> 37:55.650
Call it even?

37:55.858 --> 37:57.360
Pathetic.

37:57.568 --> 37:58.443
Ah.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.362
Doctor, do come in.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.530
Please, take a seat.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.034
Have you any news for me?

38:05.242 --> 38:06.117
Yes.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.663
I analyzed your Gold Cure.

38:08.871 --> 38:11.331
It contains absolutely no gold.

38:11.539 --> 38:15.043
It does, however, contain traces
of strychnine and cocaine.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.628
Cocaine?

38:16.836 --> 38:19.422
Your mood swings have nothing to do
with alcohol withdrawal.

38:19.632 --> 38:21.925
What you are suffering from
is cocaine addiction.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.637
I suggest you stop taking it
immediately.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.931
However, it won't be easy.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.724
I'm prepared for that.

38:30.184 --> 38:32.978
Well, it may be simpler
than repairing other damages.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.481
Thank you, Doctor.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.565
I'll take that under advisement.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.862
Detective!

38:43.822 --> 38:45.699
- Is it him?
- No.

38:45.907 --> 38:46.951
It's Beth!

38:47.159 --> 38:49.786
- Miss Tipton.
- She's sending an S.O.S.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.123
Can you find out where she is?

38:59.130 --> 39:01.507
She's at
the Great North Western office.

39:08.597 --> 39:09.639
George, organize the men

39:09.849 --> 39:11.141
and search the building
for Mr. Ryder.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.144
- Sir.
- Miss Tipton, are you all right?

39:15.271 --> 39:16.355
It was Gabriel.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.106
He came to my apartment
and -- and -- and --

39:18.315 --> 39:19.525
- I let him in and then --
- It's all right.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.193
It's all right. You're fine now.
Where is he?

39:21.402 --> 39:23.653
I tried to get away from him,
but he forced me to come here.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.489
I see.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.532
He's gonna come back and get me.
I just know it.

39:27.742 --> 39:28.576
No, he won't.

39:28.784 --> 39:32.413
He's gonna kill me.
Please, j-just get this off of me.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.675
Drink some tea, dear.
You'll feel better.

39:45.885 --> 39:47.844
I can't stop shaking.

39:48.054 --> 39:50.139
I know, dear.
I know.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.432
Sir, we stationed men
at the train station.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.684
- No sign of Mr. Ryder.
- Very good.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.353
Though I doubt
they'll be necessary.

39:56.561 --> 39:57.980
Something not sitting right
with you, sir?

39:58.188 --> 40:00.106
- No, it's not.
- I know what you mean.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.068
There certainly are questions.

40:02.275 --> 40:06.197
Why would Mr. Ryder
transport Miss Tipton

40:06.405 --> 40:08.865
to the telegraph office
just to leave here there unharmed?

40:09.074 --> 40:10.159
I mean, why not --

40:11.284 --> 40:13.411
Why not just kill her?

40:14.246 --> 40:16.623
Something more tangible
than questions, George.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.335
If I were to tie your hands
behind your back,

40:19.543 --> 40:21.795
where would the knot
of the rope be?

40:22.003 --> 40:23.713
I suppose it would be
on the outside of my hands

40:23.922 --> 40:24.757
facing you, sir.

40:24.965 --> 40:26.007
Yes.

40:26.217 --> 40:27.510
Yet when I untied Miss Tipton,

40:27.717 --> 40:30.846
the knot was on the inside,
between her hands and her body.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.389
And how would it get like that?

40:49.405 --> 40:51.742
Miss Tipton tied the knot herself.

40:51.951 --> 40:54.869
In fact, she orchestrated
her own kidnapping.

40:55.079 --> 40:56.914
And most likely killed
Kingsley Adams

40:57.123 --> 40:58.164
and Veronica Williams.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.666
And Mr. Ryder?

40:59.875 --> 41:01.543
His fate's unknown.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.713
How can we prove any of this?

41:06.340 --> 41:08.592
George, how are
your telegraphy skills?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.885
Sir, poor at best.

41:11.804 --> 41:13.012
That'll do nicely.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.351
Thank you, Detective.

41:17.559 --> 41:19.978
And how are you feeling,
Miss Tipton?

41:20.186 --> 41:21.105
Much better now.

41:21.313 --> 41:24.233
I think if I could just go home
and rest, I'll be fine.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.608
Of course.

41:25.818 --> 41:28.403
Oh, my goodness.

41:28.612 --> 41:30.864
- What is it, Mrs. Jones?
- A transmission.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.409
- It's from Gabriel Ryder.
- Gabriel?

41:34.617 --> 41:35.661
What's he saying?

41:35.869 --> 41:37.329
It's difficult to make out.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.873
It seems he's been hurt.

41:39.081 --> 41:40.623
A-Attacked?

41:40.833 --> 41:42.001
I can't quite understand.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.878
Detective, I don't know
if I can listen to this.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.380
Please, I-I'd --
I'd really like to go home.

41:46.588 --> 41:49.257
Miss Tipton,
I must insist you remain here.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.300
Ask him where he is.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.344
Detective,
I think I'd rather go home.

41:52.552 --> 41:53.971
Well, that would be
far too risky.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.222
Then I'll go
to my brother's house.

41:55.431 --> 41:57.307
Please, Detective,
I must insist.

41:57.516 --> 41:58.391
He's not responding.

41:58.601 --> 42:00.853
Very well, then.
I'll have a couple of constables --

42:01.061 --> 42:02.353
No!

42:02.563 --> 42:03.813
Miss Tipton.

42:04.023 --> 42:05.858
I need to leave.

42:07.443 --> 42:09.445
It's against my better judgment.

42:21.248 --> 42:23.958
So that's where you hid
Mr. Ryder.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.003
Thank you for leading me to him.

42:31.217 --> 42:32.467
But how?

42:33.719 --> 42:36.639
The telegraph can be
such a deceitful device.

42:36.847 --> 42:38.681
Anyone can impersonate anyone.

42:38.891 --> 42:40.516
Even a lowly constable

42:40.726 --> 42:44.103
could become the dead manager
of a telegraph company.

42:44.313 --> 42:47.608
And a lonely, bitter woman
can become a murderer.

42:53.405 --> 42:57.492
When I realized
that a few kind words from A.K.

42:57.701 --> 43:00.246
could open
a woman's change purse,

43:00.454 --> 43:03.873
I thought to myself,
"Beth Tipton,

43:04.083 --> 43:06.751
you don't need to be a telegraph
operator the rest of your life."

43:06.960 --> 43:08.253
So you killed them.

43:08.963 --> 43:11.172
You killed Kingsley Adams,
assumed his identity,

43:11.382 --> 43:13.550
and continued to exploit
the other women.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.010
But Miss Williams found out, didn't she?

43:16.219 --> 43:18.847
Ronnie became suspicious.

43:19.431 --> 43:22.141
One day I found her going through
my transmissions.

43:22.351 --> 43:24.103
And Mr. Ryder?

43:24.728 --> 43:27.438
He was supposed to take the blame,
but you set him free.

43:27.648 --> 43:30.150
So I thought of the kidnapping.

43:32.527 --> 43:35.030
He was so easily led
into temptation.

43:35.614 --> 43:38.701
I suppose he was to disappear,
never to be heard from again.

43:38.909 --> 43:40.159
Maybe.

43:40.369 --> 43:43.289
Or maybe he'd send you
another taunting message.

43:43.496 --> 43:45.373
Just to prove he'd escaped.

43:45.581 --> 43:48.668
That's the funny thing
about the telegraph, Detective.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.045
You never really know
who's on the other end, do you?

44:03.516 --> 44:04.518
Margaret.

44:04.726 --> 44:06.353
Thomas.

44:06.561 --> 44:08.688
Thank you for seeing me.

44:11.442 --> 44:13.402
I know that I've been ill-humored
lately.

44:13.610 --> 44:15.820
- Because of the drink.
- No, because of the Gold Cure!

44:16.030 --> 44:17.405
You're making excuses, Thomas.

44:17.614 --> 44:19.742
It's got cocaine in it, woman!

44:21.034 --> 44:24.204
But you're right, though.
That's no excuse.

44:24.413 --> 44:26.998
You're not exactly a walk in the park,
though, either,

44:27.206 --> 44:28.958
not since
this Temperance League thing.

44:29.168 --> 44:30.835
Why do you think
I joined the League?

44:31.045 --> 44:32.503
Just to stop you from drinking?

44:32.713 --> 44:33.547
Yes.

44:33.755 --> 44:35.840
No.
Truthfully, I'm not quite sure.

44:36.050 --> 44:38.510
Thomas, I wanted you
to listen to me again,

44:38.719 --> 44:40.637
like before the children.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.889
You don't even take me
to the theater anymore.

44:43.097 --> 44:46.059
Well, you have my attention now.

44:46.268 --> 44:47.853
I think a compromise
is in order.

44:48.061 --> 44:50.813
I'll quit the Temperance League
if you'll quit drinking.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.525
It's not like I'm coming home late
every night,

44:53.733 --> 44:54.693
spending all hours down the pub.

44:54.902 --> 44:55.777
Thomas.

44:57.945 --> 45:01.240
If that's what you want,
I'll stop drinking.

45:01.992 --> 45:05.244
Or... perhaps we could consider
moderation.

45:06.163 --> 45:07.121
That might work.

45:07.331 --> 45:08.664
And can I persuade you

45:08.873 --> 45:11.293
to join me
for "Romeo and Juliet" next week?

45:11.501 --> 45:12.753
I don't know.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.463
Isn't that the one
where they both die in the end?

45:15.672 --> 45:18.342
Yes, but only 'cause
they can't bear to be apart.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.969
Thomas.

45:22.971 --> 45:25.516
Oh. Here.
Let me help you.

45:25.724 --> 45:27.768
You've had a long day.

45:31.521 --> 45:33.148
Thank you.

45:33.356 --> 45:35.483
Alwyn will be waiting.

45:35.692 --> 45:37.527
May I walk you home?

45:37.735 --> 45:40.030
You've your work to finish.

45:40.614 --> 45:43.409
Enid...

45:43.617 --> 45:44.952
I'm sorry for what's happened.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.913
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

45:48.121 --> 45:51.125
This has been an eye-opening experience
for me.

45:51.333 --> 45:54.836
And now I know you
a little bit better.

45:55.503 --> 45:57.005
I see.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.298
When can I see you again?

45:59.507 --> 46:02.969
I just need a little time
to myself, William.

46:03.887 --> 46:06.181
Oh.
I'm interrupting.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.434
No, no.
I was just leaving.

46:10.059 --> 46:13.021
- Good day, Dr. Ogden.
- Good day, Mrs. Jones.

46:14.898 --> 46:17.900
I was just stopping by to drop something
off to the inspector,

46:18.110 --> 46:19.902
to help with his withdrawal symptoms.

46:20.112 --> 46:21.362
Do you know where he is?

46:21.572 --> 46:23.782
I have no idea.

46:23.990 --> 46:26.159
Blue salvias.

46:26.367 --> 46:27.952
From Mrs. Jones?

46:28.161 --> 46:29.246
Yes.

46:30.539 --> 46:31.998
"I think of you."

46:33.416 --> 46:34.876
Pardon?

46:35.085 --> 46:39.088
The meaning of blue salvias --
"I think of you."

46:41.132 --> 46:43.010
Of course.

46:43.885 --> 46:44.927
Good day, Detective.

46:45.137 --> 46:47.181
Good day, Doctor.
