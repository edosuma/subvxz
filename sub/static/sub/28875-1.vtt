00:43.052 --> 00:44.803
I'm a dangerous man.

00:46.763 --> 00:48.471
When I get hell-bent
on something,

00:48.473 --> 00:49.473
I can be,

00:50.391 --> 00:51.392
downright mean.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.564
I get over zealous and,

00:58.359 --> 01:00.524
I can be forgetful of others,

01:00.526 --> 01:02.737
insensitive to their pain.

01:04.447 --> 01:07.115
It's my experience that,

01:07.117 --> 01:09.826
zeal is,

01:09.828 --> 01:15.498
the most dangerous characteristic
a man can possess.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.584
There's no talking to zeal.

01:18.753 --> 01:21.922
Now, all I need to
do is get a name.

01:21.924 --> 01:24.257
All you need to
do is give me one.

01:24.259 --> 01:26.968
I have a way of doing things.

01:26.970 --> 01:28.719
There's an order to it.

01:28.721 --> 01:30.721
I used to ask questions first.

01:30.723 --> 01:32.933
Before the nails, I mean.

01:32.935 --> 01:35.684
I would ask, and they would lie,

01:35.686 --> 01:37.854
then I'd have to nail
them to the table,

01:37.856 --> 01:41.900
and start all over again
asking my questions.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.527
I'm a busy man,

01:43.529 --> 01:44.527
time is gold,

01:44.529 --> 01:46.822
you understand.

01:46.824 --> 01:49.576
So now, I always
start with the nails.

02:12.057 --> 02:13.142
Pardon my grin.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.214
Clarence.

02:46.216 --> 02:48.216
Thanks for coming
to the house, bro.

02:48.218 --> 02:49.551
Sit down.

02:49.553 --> 02:50.844
And these
children are beautiful.

02:50.846 --> 02:52.387
I can't believe Mina.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.972
She's turning sixteen.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.849
We're gonna have a big party.

02:55.851 --> 02:57.058
Cigar?

02:57.060 --> 02:58.145
No, no thanks.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.484
So?

03:06.611 --> 03:08.197
You're not gonna like this.

03:17.706 --> 03:19.580
You want me to take care of it?

03:19.582 --> 03:21.084
No, you've done your part.

03:24.713 --> 03:26.048
Let's get you paid my bro.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.513
How much
money are you keeping,

03:34.515 --> 03:35.639
around the house these days?

03:35.641 --> 03:37.224
Why, you looking to rob me?

03:37.226 --> 03:38.600
It's just not safe.

03:38.602 --> 03:39.935
I've told you that before.

03:39.937 --> 03:41.811
Mother hen, always watchful.

03:41.813 --> 03:43.646
Relax, this is collection night.

03:43.648 --> 03:45.899
This all going back
to Norik's house.

03:45.901 --> 03:47.859
So he
sends his own people?

03:47.861 --> 03:49.069
At the end of every week.

03:49.071 --> 03:50.403
On a motorcycle, no less.

03:50.405 --> 03:51.321
My nephew.

03:53.909 --> 03:55.577
Very fast, very efficient.

03:57.246 --> 03:58.956
Thank you for
everything, my friend.

04:00.332 --> 04:01.539
Enough business,

04:01.541 --> 04:03.750
let me show you
something very beautiful.

04:07.588 --> 04:10.048
I have had this made,

04:10.050 --> 04:12.177
for Mina for her
sixteenth birthday.

04:13.636 --> 04:15.345
She's a very special girl.

04:15.347 --> 04:17.555
I spared no expense.

04:17.557 --> 04:20.433
Norik knows this
diamond guy in Burbank.

04:20.435 --> 04:22.727
He's going to put
the center stone.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.187
It's going back to
him for finishing.

04:29.194 --> 04:29.985
How lovely.

04:39.955 --> 04:42.291
Alright, home sweet home.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.377
Wow, this is a nice place.

04:47.379 --> 04:49.045
Really, you like it?

04:49.047 --> 04:51.006
I wouldn't say, I
thought it was nice place,

04:51.008 --> 04:52.715
if I didn't like it?

04:52.717 --> 04:54.175
That's cool.

04:54.177 --> 04:55.594
Did you like the band?

04:55.596 --> 04:57.137
I did.

04:57.139 --> 04:57.929
That's cool.

04:57.931 --> 04:58.931
I like music.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.560
Good for you, sweetie!

05:02.602 --> 05:06.062
Music is the
language of the soul.

05:06.064 --> 05:07.064
Cool.

05:08.774 --> 05:10.233
Let's go to your bedroom.

05:16.491 --> 05:17.657
I need to pee.

05:17.659 --> 05:18.825
Oh, you do?

05:18.827 --> 05:20.577
Yeah, I need to pee.

05:20.579 --> 05:21.494
I'll be right back.

05:21.496 --> 05:22.454
Take your clothes off, okay?

05:22.456 --> 05:23.746
Oh no, that's alright.

05:23.748 --> 05:24.831
I can wait for...

05:24.833 --> 05:25.623
No.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.833
I want you naked.

05:26.835 --> 05:27.750
When I come back,

05:27.752 --> 05:29.044
I want my boy waiting for me,

05:29.046 --> 05:31.338
with nothing on but
a smile, you hear?

05:31.340 --> 05:32.130
Alright.

05:47.147 --> 05:47.937
Bedroom.

05:47.939 --> 05:48.855
Across the living room.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.322
Hey, I-What the fuck.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.746
Rad place.

06:05.748 --> 06:07.415
Very pawnable.

06:07.417 --> 06:08.208
Good job.

06:16.885 --> 06:18.301
I wanna rob a bank.

06:18.303 --> 06:19.594
It's hard work and
lots of planning,

06:19.596 --> 06:21.179
if you wanna get it right.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.806
First bank I ever
robbed was with my dad.

06:22.808 --> 06:25.183
I was 17.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.102
He did all the planning,

06:27.104 --> 06:27.894
and carried the gun.

06:27.896 --> 06:30.188
I just drove on the day.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.565
We're kinda screwed
on cash here.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.859
How much?

06:33.861 --> 06:36.986
147.44.

06:36.988 --> 06:39.072
Do you want to
stay another night?

06:39.074 --> 06:40.074
We can.

06:41.284 --> 06:42.492
I say we fill up the tank,

06:42.494 --> 06:43.660
and drive out to Flagstaff,

06:43.662 --> 06:45.537
shake down some college kid.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.038
They got Arizona U near there.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.124
Business school kid
or something, maybe?

06:53.004 --> 06:54.212
Oh, what's the
fun in having a gun,

06:54.214 --> 06:55.465
if you can't rob a bank.

06:57.676 --> 06:58.676
I feel ya.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.553
It's in my blood.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.807
Robbing banks, I mean.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.763
My dad, his dad.

07:04.765 --> 07:07.934
So, when you say you
wanna do one of them,

07:07.936 --> 07:09.853
I think it's pretty
goddamn righteous.

07:15.318 --> 07:17.776
Well let's do it then.

07:17.778 --> 07:21.364
You know, ripping off
hipsters and frats boys is,

07:21.366 --> 07:23.575
complete fucking drag.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.536
Let's do something big.

07:26.538 --> 07:29.205
Bonnie would have never stood
for this rinky dink shit.

07:29.207 --> 07:30.290
Bonnie?

07:30.292 --> 07:32.584
Parker.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.461
And that's just how
you'll end up, too sweety.

07:34.463 --> 07:35.712
Life's not a movie.

07:35.714 --> 07:36.754
You sure?

07:36.756 --> 07:38.089
It's got tragedy
written all over it.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.924
It's a bank, it's
not a scared kid.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.928
With a bank, you
don't plan it right,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.471
if you're unlucky,

07:44.473 --> 07:46.681
you can loose everything.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.058
My father was killed in a bank
robbery, you know that right.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.645
Okay forget banks, then.

07:51.688 --> 07:52.688
How about a,

07:54.733 --> 07:55.776
a poker game?

07:56.651 --> 07:58.777
I've seen that in movies.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.737
Some gangster with a poker game,

08:00.739 --> 08:03.615
and we come through the
doors with shotguns.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.910
And nobody can call
the cops because,

08:05.912 --> 08:08.578
it's all illegal anyway.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.707
And you know this gangster
with the poker game.

08:11.876 --> 08:13.875
No but we can find one.

08:13.877 --> 08:16.377
I mean we know
people we can ask.

08:16.379 --> 08:18.507
Come on, you're not
thinking creatively.

08:19.508 --> 08:21.382
There's money out there Fred.

08:21.384 --> 08:22.675
So much of it.

08:22.677 --> 08:25.930
And it's just sitting
in people's pockets.

08:25.932 --> 08:28.015
Let's figure out
how we can take it.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.437
You know my grandfather
was real creative.

08:34.438 --> 08:37.398
He used to robbed banks and,

08:37.400 --> 08:39.609
bars and restaurants, pharmacies,
whatever you name it.

08:39.611 --> 08:40.527
He's famous.

08:40.529 --> 08:41.861
In newspapers and everything.

08:41.864 --> 08:42.654
Nuh uh.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.280
Yeah he is.

08:44.282 --> 08:46.324
Boe Carroll.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.993
He killed a lady a
year before I was born.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.746
He ran her over in his car,

08:51.748 --> 08:54.541
leaving a smash and grab
actually at a car dealership.

08:54.543 --> 08:56.709
They gave him life for that.

08:56.711 --> 08:57.585
You're making it up.

08:57.587 --> 08:58.378
I'm not.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.170
Boe Carroll.

08:59.172 --> 08:59.963
Grandpa Boe.

08:59.965 --> 09:00.967
Look it up.

09:01.801 --> 09:03.383
Look it up.

09:03.385 --> 09:04.926
Boe Carroll.

09:04.928 --> 09:07.095
A celebrity in the family.

09:07.097 --> 09:09.639
Why haven't you
mentioned him before?

09:09.641 --> 09:12.725
Not exactly something
most people are proud of.

09:12.727 --> 09:14.102
They have internet.

09:14.104 --> 09:15.019
Don't us it.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.271
It's probably expensive as hell.

09:16.273 --> 09:18.147
We'll put
it on the cards.

09:18.149 --> 09:22.110
He sold robberies,
more than anything else.

09:22.112 --> 09:23.987
Find a mark, stake
it out for years.

09:23.989 --> 09:26.906
Seriously, years.

09:26.908 --> 09:29.200
He'd figure out where the
entrance and the exit were,

09:29.202 --> 09:32.203
and then pinpoint when the
place would be flush with cash.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.496
And then, when the
time was right,

09:33.498 --> 09:35.040
he'd either sell the job,

09:35.042 --> 09:38.878
or if it was real special
he'd do it himself.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.006
My dad actually
worked a lot with him.

09:42.132 --> 09:44.632
They made a real
living doing it,

09:44.634 --> 09:46.844
back in the day when you could
make a real living doing it.

09:46.846 --> 09:47.845
Here he is!

09:47.847 --> 09:48.848
Boe Carroll.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.975
He's handsome.

09:52.977 --> 09:54.267
He had my dad when
he was like nineteen,

09:54.269 --> 09:57.353
so they were more like
brothers than anything else.

09:57.355 --> 09:59.397
Fred, Freddie.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.773
Grandpa's a free man.

10:00.775 --> 10:01.774
What?

10:01.776 --> 10:02.692
Yep.

10:02.694 --> 10:04.319
There did a news story about it.

10:04.321 --> 10:05.570
Bullshit they gave him life.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.362
Yeah.

10:06.364 --> 10:07.447
Released last October.

10:07.449 --> 10:08.910
He's been out a year.

10:11.119 --> 10:12.785
Intermediate life sentence.

10:12.787 --> 10:13.829
Indeterminate.

10:13.831 --> 10:15.915
Indeterminate life sentence.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.708
I thought life in prison
meant life in prison.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.545
Who decides how
long a life is?

11:16.059 --> 11:18.142
Holy shit.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.604
Boe, is that you?

11:22.649 --> 11:25.483
Cause all I can
see is an old man.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.275
It's me, Artie.

11:26.277 --> 11:28.154
I'm in here somewhere.

11:29.197 --> 11:32.032
C'mere, before I start crying.

11:41.376 --> 11:43.626
When Ann died I traded
our house for this place,

11:43.628 --> 11:45.586
and I never got around to,

11:45.588 --> 11:49.174
exactly decorating.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.551
Why'd you sell your house?

11:51.553 --> 11:54.138
It was too much to maintain.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.140
Too much room.

11:56.599 --> 11:58.266
That was Ann's house, right?

11:58.268 --> 12:00.101
The one on Glenoaks?

12:00.103 --> 12:01.394
Yeah.

12:01.396 --> 12:03.354
I took the cash from
the sale of the house,

12:03.356 --> 12:06.107
for a little retirement.

12:06.109 --> 12:07.692
Savings only go so far,

12:07.694 --> 12:10.863
and God knows the government
only helps out so much.

12:10.865 --> 12:13.031
That was her
parents house, no?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.702
I mean she grew up there.

12:17.454 --> 12:19.039
Situations change.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.081
You know,

12:22.083 --> 12:25.836
When I got all the paper
work for the parole board,

12:25.838 --> 12:28.256
and I saw your address
wasn't Glenoaks,

12:31.134 --> 12:32.134
I felt a chill.

12:34.345 --> 12:35.388
Time goes by, Boe.

12:36.306 --> 12:39.141
I don't have to tell you that.

12:39.143 --> 12:40.143
No.

12:41.145 --> 12:42.895
Anyway, look,

12:42.897 --> 12:44.897
this place is more
than enough for me,

12:44.899 --> 12:46.566
and plenty of room for a guest.

12:47.902 --> 12:49.317
You're more than welcome here.

12:49.319 --> 12:50.319
I mean it.

12:51.404 --> 12:55.450
I got to thank you
Artie, for taking me in.

12:56.994 --> 12:59.744
What we been through, come on?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.080
To be honest, it'll be
nice to have a friend,

13:01.082 --> 13:02.956
to shoot the shit with.

13:02.958 --> 13:03.958
Yeah.

13:05.044 --> 13:06.044
By the way,

13:08.213 --> 13:09.965
sorry about Ann.

13:11.216 --> 13:14.843
Oh yeah well.

13:14.845 --> 13:16.179
Everybody's gotta die right.

13:17.555 --> 13:19.305
People we love gotta
die, we gotta die.

13:19.307 --> 13:22.141
You feel sad about that you
gotta be sad about everything,

13:22.143 --> 13:23.811
you know what I mean?

13:23.813 --> 13:25.103
Yeah.

13:26.397 --> 13:28.190
Look at the talk
I'm giving you.

13:28.192 --> 13:29.607
Right out of jail
25 fucking years,

13:29.609 --> 13:31.193
haven't seen each other in 10,

13:31.195 --> 13:33.515
and this is the talk I'm giving
you right through the door.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.366
It's alright, Artie.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.367
Alright, alright.

13:39.369 --> 13:41.285
You want to go on the tour?

13:41.287 --> 13:42.578
See your room?

13:42.580 --> 13:48.751
Oh would you mind
if I sit for a minute?

13:48.753 --> 13:49.669
Yeah of
course, of course.

13:49.671 --> 13:52.213
Eight hours from Susanville.

13:52.215 --> 13:53.131
What a jerk I am.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.258
Sit your ass on the couch.

13:55.260 --> 13:58.262
Sit, relax. I'm gonna
turn the game on,

13:58.264 --> 14:00.140
I was about to open
up a jar of olives.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.114
Hey Boe, you want a beer?

14:17.116 --> 14:18.406
A beer?

14:18.408 --> 14:19.908
Yeah.

14:19.910 --> 14:20.995
You got it.

15:13.130 --> 15:15.172
Oh I see you found the olives.

15:15.174 --> 15:16.339
Speaking of heaven.

15:21.262 --> 15:23.347
You'll get your bearings.

15:23.349 --> 15:25.598
You get on a
schedule, a routine.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.557
Get a hobby.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.684
Millions of channels on the TV.

15:28.686 --> 15:31.230
Did you get TV in the
can at the end there?

15:31.232 --> 15:33.314
Yeah some.

15:33.316 --> 15:36.193
Well I'm gonna turn you
on to a lot of new programs.

15:36.195 --> 15:37.693
You ever hear of Net flick?

15:37.695 --> 15:38.695
No.

15:39.823 --> 15:41.658
Movies in the mail.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.660
Oh, by the way,

15:45.662 --> 15:48.080
you gotta see your
parole officer this week?

15:48.082 --> 15:49.372
Yeah Monday.

15:49.374 --> 15:51.041
What does he
expect you to do till then?

15:51.043 --> 15:53.835
Well they gave me gate money,

15:53.837 --> 15:56.338
the phone number for SSI.

15:56.340 --> 15:57.713
25 years, they
put you on a bus,

15:57.715 --> 15:59.507
goodbye, good luck?

15:59.509 --> 16:00.677
26.

16:04.681 --> 16:07.349
You see a counselor in there?

16:07.351 --> 16:08.141
Something?

16:08.143 --> 16:09.392
Oh yeah.

16:09.394 --> 16:11.812
Lots of swell advice.

16:11.814 --> 16:13.480
Dirt bags.

16:13.482 --> 16:15.481
Don't worry, pal. I'm
gonna take care of you,

16:15.483 --> 16:17.903
and get you on your feet,
just the way you did for me.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.569
What did I ever do for you?

16:20.571 --> 16:23.865
What you loose your
memory, old timer.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.995
You gave me my first
professional gig.

16:29.373 --> 16:31.248
City of Industry.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.292
I knew you wouldn't
have forgotten.

16:33.294 --> 16:35.543
Wells Fargo.

16:35.545 --> 16:38.048
It was the first and
only bank I ever took.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.049
Up til then what was I doin,

16:41.051 --> 16:42.384
knocking off liquor stores,

16:42.386 --> 16:44.721
with a sawed-off and
a lot of hollering.

16:46.390 --> 16:48.809
But you gave me that
plan for a song.

16:50.727 --> 16:51.935
You remember, what was it?

16:51.937 --> 16:53.257
Five hundred dollars
or something.

16:54.315 --> 16:55.521
The timeline, the getaway plan,

16:55.523 --> 16:57.608
the alarm box combo,
the whole enchilada.

17:02.031 --> 17:03.321
You had me dress, what was it,

17:03.323 --> 17:06.615
the blue overalls, and
the yellow hard hat,

17:06.617 --> 17:08.534
cause there was a construction
site across the street.

17:08.536 --> 17:09.911
The police come, they're
looking for the perp,

17:09.913 --> 17:11.246
what do they see?

17:11.248 --> 17:12.621
13 fuckers dressed the same way.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.294
It was beautiful.

17:17.296 --> 17:20.922
That was the most beautiful
thing I was ever involved in.

17:20.924 --> 17:23.675
I walked away with
50,000 dollars.

17:24.635 --> 17:27.512
50,000 dollars 1965.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.389
Bought Ann's parent's house,

17:29.391 --> 17:30.598
we bought that maid service.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.144
Mickey was born that summer.

17:34.104 --> 17:37.314
You got my whole life
going for 500 dollars.

17:37.316 --> 17:39.816
I'll never forget you for that.

17:39.818 --> 17:41.860
You're welcome Artie.

17:55.834 --> 17:58.001
What does it say?

17:58.003 --> 17:59.004
Go to bed.

18:02.799 --> 18:04.009
Here we are.

18:09.555 --> 18:13.433
It's a little sparse, but
you know we go to Ikea,

18:13.435 --> 18:16.019
get you some nice stuff.

18:16.021 --> 18:19.730
My grandson says this is
pretty comfortable, actually.

18:49.096 --> 18:50.095
Boe?

18:50.097 --> 18:51.890
Can I come in?

18:53.433 --> 18:55.016
Yeah.

18:55.018 --> 18:56.686
Yeah sure, come on in.

19:00.023 --> 19:01.023
You awake?

19:03.068 --> 19:04.234
It's okay.

19:04.236 --> 19:05.861
What do you need?

19:05.863 --> 19:07.279
You got a car?

19:07.281 --> 19:08.779
Yeah, yeah sure.

19:08.781 --> 19:09.697
I got a car.

19:09.699 --> 19:11.243
You want to go somewhere?

19:12.327 --> 19:13.118
Ann's house.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.204
Your place on Glenoaks.

19:16.206 --> 19:18.582
Boe, I already told
you, it's gone.

19:18.584 --> 19:19.784
What do you mean gone?

19:21.920 --> 19:24.045
Someone else is livin there.

19:24.047 --> 19:26.673
Some, I don't know,
Pakistani family.

19:26.675 --> 19:29.468
I thought it could wait
a day, but it can't.

19:29.470 --> 19:31.845
I got to go now.

19:31.847 --> 19:33.640
Why do you have to
go to Ann's house?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.141
I gotta get something.

19:36.143 --> 19:37.143
Something I buried.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.727
Something you buried?

19:39.729 --> 19:41.604
Before I went away.

19:41.606 --> 19:44.193
In the back yard,
behind the fence.

19:45.319 --> 19:46.652
In '79?

19:53.452 --> 19:55.619
How deep are we talkin?

20:01.335 --> 20:04.585
You're still a
crazy motherfucker.

20:04.587 --> 20:06.171
All those years
of good behavior,

20:06.173 --> 20:08.631
you were just killing
time, weren't you?

20:10.593 --> 20:12.637
What else you gonna
do in jail, Arthur?

20:14.932 --> 20:17.432
I told you it'd still be there.

20:17.434 --> 20:18.936
You buried it deep enough.

20:21.396 --> 20:22.145
What you want to do,

20:22.147 --> 20:23.147
get us both locked up?

20:25.651 --> 20:26.985
No, not again.

20:28.904 --> 20:30.654
Not ever.

20:30.656 --> 20:31.656
What the fuck?

20:32.616 --> 20:33.572
Let's get some sleep.

20:33.574 --> 20:35.492
Fuck that.

20:35.494 --> 20:37.537
You're showing me what's
in there, right now.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.708
It's private, okay?

20:42.876 --> 20:43.876
Not okay.

20:45.504 --> 20:46.504
Open that thing.

20:47.965 --> 20:50.467
You ever do any time Arthur?

20:51.551 --> 20:52.759
What does that got
to do with anything?

20:52.761 --> 20:55.097
No, you've never done a day.

20:56.974 --> 20:59.558
Look I am aware,

20:59.560 --> 21:02.435
that I've been very lucky
and you got fucked over.

21:02.437 --> 21:04.145
You've never had
to take a shit,

21:04.147 --> 21:06.147
in a room the size of a closet,

21:06.149 --> 21:08.441
with another man watching you,

21:08.443 --> 21:10.193
getting ready to
take a shit himself,

21:10.195 --> 21:12.070
and you're gonna
have to watch him,

21:12.072 --> 21:12.988
or at least smell it.

21:12.990 --> 21:14.613
Cause sure you could turn away,

21:14.615 --> 21:17.077
but you have to smell it.

21:18.036 --> 21:19.036
Breath it.

21:21.206 --> 21:24.749
Boe, you can't stay here,

21:24.751 --> 21:26.876
if you don't show me
what's inside the box.

21:26.878 --> 21:30.964
26 years I waited
to dig this up.

21:30.966 --> 21:35.385
It's the only privacy I've
got left in the world.

21:35.387 --> 21:37.512
It's all I've got
left to myself.

21:37.514 --> 21:40.765
I mean 26 miserable
god damned years,

21:40.767 --> 21:43.228
I spent every night
dreaming of this box.

21:44.521 --> 21:47.105
It was out here, in the world,

21:47.107 --> 21:50.859
buried where only I knew.

21:50.861 --> 21:53.736
My ass may have belonged
to the state, but this box,

21:53.738 --> 21:56.698
buried, locked, untouched.

21:56.700 --> 21:59.828
This I could claim for myself.

22:00.912 --> 22:02.579
You speak of good behavior,

22:02.581 --> 22:04.331
oh there was lots of that.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.374
Yes sir, no ma'am.

22:06.376 --> 22:08.835
But the shameful
cocksuckery of that,

22:08.837 --> 22:11.254
was made just about
barely endurable,

22:11.256 --> 22:14.591
by being able to lay down
every night and dream,

22:14.593 --> 22:18.221
of the one place on God's earth
I could still call my own.

22:25.686 --> 22:26.730
Arthur,

22:32.361 --> 22:33.362
you're my friend,

22:35.823 --> 22:37.574
my only friend in the world,

22:39.201 --> 22:43.163
but I cannot show you
what's in this box.

22:44.874 --> 22:45.874
I will not.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.130
What about your
parole officer,

22:54.132 --> 22:55.133
you gonna show him?

22:56.301 --> 22:57.676
Cause he's gonna come over,

22:57.678 --> 22:59.177
he's gonna search
through your shit,

22:59.179 --> 23:01.847
and he's gonna see
a steel cash box,

23:01.849 --> 23:05.308
and believe me, I think he's
gonna want a peek inside.

23:05.310 --> 23:06.894
No.

23:06.896 --> 23:10.271
During the day we'll
keep it in your room.

23:10.273 --> 23:11.774
We'll lock it in your closet.

23:12.902 --> 23:15.819
At night it stays with me.

23:15.821 --> 23:17.320
What do you got in there?

23:17.322 --> 23:18.738
Some teddy bear?

23:18.740 --> 23:20.365
You wanna sleep with it?

23:20.367 --> 23:22.327
Under the pillow
if comfort allows.

23:26.248 --> 23:27.958
What am I gonna do with you?

23:29.668 --> 23:31.960
Thanks for
understanding Arthur.

23:31.962 --> 23:33.211
No I don't understand.

23:33.213 --> 23:34.213
I'm giving in.

23:35.966 --> 23:38.007
Sometimes that's what it takes.

23:44.599 --> 23:45.599
Goodnight.

23:48.729 --> 23:49.602
Goodnight.

24:02.242 --> 24:04.286
So, what's your plan?

24:05.620 --> 24:06.620
You got one?

24:08.957 --> 24:10.749
No.

24:10.751 --> 24:11.791
You want butter?

24:11.793 --> 24:13.334
Yeah.

24:13.336 --> 24:15.295
You want a job?

24:15.297 --> 24:16.922
No.

24:16.924 --> 24:19.757
I mean I'm not asking
because I need the money.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.345
I'll feed you, that's
not the problem.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.181
Listen, retirement's
a beautiful thing,

24:26.183 --> 24:27.183
don't get me wrong.

24:28.310 --> 24:29.977
It's just that,

24:29.979 --> 24:34.230
you really gotta fill
your days, you know.

24:34.232 --> 24:36.817
I figured that out
after Ann passed away.

24:36.819 --> 24:38.903
Before that all I was
doing was walking around,

24:38.905 --> 24:39.905
bored and drunk.

24:42.532 --> 24:44.324
Had scotch at noon,

24:44.326 --> 24:45.950
and then 10,

24:45.952 --> 24:47.994
eight o' clock with breakfast.

24:47.996 --> 24:49.788
Sounds a good idea to me.

24:49.790 --> 24:51.122
Except it's not a good idea.

24:51.124 --> 24:54.002
Especially when it stops
you from filling your days.

24:55.212 --> 24:56.212
Okay.

24:57.965 --> 25:00.967
So, what's your plan?

25:04.805 --> 25:07.972
I recon I'll follow your lead.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.852
How do you spend a day?

25:12.020 --> 25:12.811
Well.

25:57.357 --> 25:58.943
It's a peaceful life.

26:00.777 --> 26:01.526
Fine.

26:45.990 --> 26:48.072
See this old timer, here?

26:48.074 --> 26:49.240
Huh?

26:49.242 --> 26:51.284
Guy across the
street, walking the dog.

26:51.286 --> 26:53.037
It's connected.

26:53.039 --> 26:54.329
To what?

26:54.331 --> 26:55.955
Armenian mafia.

26:55.957 --> 26:58.959
Or whatever they
call themselves.

26:58.961 --> 27:00.168
They're always
hanging out in front.

27:00.170 --> 27:02.670
Like a pack of dogs,
barking at each other,

27:02.672 --> 27:06.132
barbecuing strange
meats at all hours.

27:06.134 --> 27:07.675
They play poker right
on the front porch,

27:07.677 --> 27:09.969
and the cops don't
even bother them.

27:09.971 --> 27:13.017
Hollering like little
kids, fuckin nuisance.

27:13.934 --> 27:15.725
Drive like assholes,

27:15.727 --> 27:16.979
any speed they want.

27:17.855 --> 27:19.354
You hear that motorcycle yet?

27:19.356 --> 27:20.981
Oh yeah I heard that.

27:20.983 --> 27:22.690
Middle of the fucking
night, revving his engine.

27:22.692 --> 27:25.654
He stops at the same
house all the time.

27:27.656 --> 27:29.364
Here he comes with his dog.

27:29.366 --> 27:31.075
What kind of dog is that?

27:31.077 --> 27:33.035
I don't know why
don't you ask him?

27:33.037 --> 27:34.035
Sir!

27:34.037 --> 27:35.244
I was just joking.

27:35.246 --> 27:36.037
Hello sir.

27:36.039 --> 27:37.330
Yes?

27:37.332 --> 27:38.623
What kind of
dog do you got there?

27:38.625 --> 27:41.087
This little gentleman
is a lhasaapso.

27:42.671 --> 27:44.004
He's beautiful.

27:44.006 --> 27:45.632
I thank you on his behalf.

27:46.968 --> 27:48.218
What's your name, my friend?

27:49.177 --> 27:50.176
Who's asking?

27:51.429 --> 27:52.470
You look familiar to me.

27:52.472 --> 27:53.596
We know each other?

27:53.598 --> 27:55.059
Forgive me, I am Levon.

27:55.935 --> 27:56.935
Arthur.

28:02.273 --> 28:05.067
Friends call me Boe.

28:05.069 --> 28:06.234
Boe the thief.

28:07.112 --> 28:08.111
It is you.

28:08.113 --> 28:09.445
You guys know each other?

28:09.447 --> 28:11.364
We drank too much
ouzo one night,

28:11.366 --> 28:13.282
at one of my
brother's restaurants.

28:13.284 --> 28:14.659
He made him a lot of money.

28:14.661 --> 28:16.870
His name was on my
brother's tongue.

28:16.872 --> 28:17.871
You've been gone a long time,

28:17.873 --> 28:19.247
haven't you my bro.

28:19.249 --> 28:20.581
When did you come back to
the land of the living?

28:20.583 --> 28:22.208
A week ago.

28:22.210 --> 28:23.877
Welcome back my bro.

28:23.879 --> 28:25.006
Shan tula!

28:26.131 --> 28:27.881
I'm having you both for dinner.

28:27.883 --> 28:29.925
No it's alright, we
wouldn't want to impose.

28:29.927 --> 28:31.176
I insist.

28:31.178 --> 28:32.970
My wife, she makes
enough food for an army.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.345
Do you like lamb?

28:34.347 --> 28:35.638
That's alright, I
got a chicken in the oven.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.598
I love lamb.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.809
It is settled.

28:38.811 --> 28:40.226
We are having lamb,
drinking ouzo,

28:40.228 --> 28:42.311
and reminiscing
about the old days.

28:42.313 --> 28:43.856
Let me finish up with
the doggie business,

28:43.858 --> 28:45.106
I come back okay.

28:45.108 --> 28:46.235
Don't go anywhere.

28:48.195 --> 28:49.862
Hang up, I'll walk with you.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.192
Sorry to wake ya.

29:29.110 --> 29:31.071
How was dinner?

29:35.533 --> 29:38.117
That is a lovely family.

29:38.119 --> 29:39.160
Oh yeah.

29:39.162 --> 29:40.161
Oh yeah.

29:40.163 --> 29:41.206
Two little boys.

29:42.332 --> 29:43.790
A lovely,

29:43.792 --> 29:45.625
girl of 15.

29:45.627 --> 29:46.627
That's nice.

29:50.423 --> 29:53.633
My chicken is in the oven.

29:53.635 --> 29:54.675
You eat?

29:54.677 --> 29:55.846
Oh yeah, lots.

29:57.098 --> 29:58.933
Wife's name's Nora.

30:00.309 --> 30:01.309
Hell of a cook.

30:04.313 --> 30:05.311
Good lamb?

30:05.313 --> 30:06.313
And how.

30:08.275 --> 30:09.983
Lots of spice,

30:09.985 --> 30:13.321
they cook it real
fast on a high flame.

30:14.949 --> 30:17.115
Must be some kind of marinade.

30:17.117 --> 30:19.575
Yeah must be.

30:19.577 --> 30:20.577
Fine house.

30:21.454 --> 30:22.832
Big back yard.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.251
Bunch of room for
kids to run and play.

30:27.710 --> 30:34.258
He's also got a little
office down stairs.

30:34.260 --> 30:37.054
Lots of privacy, got his
own entrance and a patio.

30:38.138 --> 30:40.973
Levon took me out
there after dinner.

30:40.975 --> 30:42.392
Smokes, cigars.

30:43.894 --> 30:45.560
He's a proud man.

30:45.562 --> 30:46.352
A man of power,

30:46.354 --> 30:47.356
some might say.

30:48.731 --> 30:51.482
I'd say, careless.

30:51.484 --> 30:54.610
I mean, take a strange
dog like me into his home?

30:54.612 --> 30:57.322
Let me loose around
those little kids?

30:57.324 --> 31:00.242
What else is he careless with?

31:00.244 --> 31:02.243
I mean, did he leave it out
there in the open on purpose?

31:02.245 --> 31:04.163
Was I meant to see it?

31:04.165 --> 31:05.998
Is he just that stupid?

31:06.000 --> 31:07.582
See what?

31:07.584 --> 31:08.583
A bag.

31:08.585 --> 31:10.379
A big bag.

31:11.881 --> 31:13.546
It was zipped tight,

31:13.548 --> 31:15.173
but it didn't take
much imagination,

31:15.175 --> 31:17.218
to figure what was inside.

31:18.345 --> 31:20.304
Shapes, Artie.

31:20.306 --> 31:22.555
There are certain shapes
a man in my line of work,

31:22.557 --> 31:26.184
will recognize, bagged or no,

31:26.186 --> 31:28.147
26 years away or no.

31:28.981 --> 31:30.646
It had to be cash.

31:30.648 --> 31:32.773
I could smell it.

31:32.775 --> 31:34.358
20 grand at least in there,

31:34.360 --> 31:36.864
even if it was all
singles, which I doubt.

31:38.239 --> 31:41.033
There was guns too on top.

31:41.035 --> 31:42.035
I could see them.

31:43.244 --> 31:46.662
No safe, just a bag,

31:46.664 --> 31:49.126
out there, in the
middle of the desk.

31:50.127 --> 31:51.461
Quite a conversation piece,

31:54.423 --> 31:57.007
except I didn't make peep one.

32:13.441 --> 32:15.318
I could go in the
back with a shotgun.

32:16.527 --> 32:19.029
If that old gangster
got in my way,

32:19.031 --> 32:22.074
or any of those brat
offspring of his,

32:22.076 --> 32:25.827
or that fat cunny
of a wife of his?

32:25.829 --> 32:28.248
I'd blast their
goddamn faces off.

32:30.459 --> 32:33.461
Oh my God, that'd
be the real prize.

32:34.504 --> 32:37.546
To be myself once again.

32:37.548 --> 32:40.424
Go in like a wolf one last time.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.803
Raging fangs and claws.

32:42.805 --> 32:44.471
Come out with all that cash.

32:44.473 --> 32:46.848
Covered in blood,
pockets full of dough.

32:48.102 --> 32:49.352
That old time feeling.

32:52.647 --> 32:54.066
Is it wrong to still dream?

32:59.154 --> 33:01.320
I'll tell you straight, Artie,

33:01.322 --> 33:03.117
just between you and me.

33:03.909 --> 33:07.410
That girl I killed,

33:07.412 --> 33:09.331
on the job they
sent me away for?

33:11.332 --> 33:14.625
I'd kill her a
thousand times over.

33:14.627 --> 33:18.463
When I went up in front
of the parole board,

33:18.465 --> 33:19.797
they asked me,

33:19.799 --> 33:22.926
what I'd have done
different with my life?

33:22.928 --> 33:26.221
How I would have
lived it better?

33:26.223 --> 33:28.308
I told them what
they wanted to hear.

33:29.435 --> 33:30.435
The truth is,

33:32.438 --> 33:33.438
I'd have been worse.

33:34.523 --> 33:35.773
Much worse.

33:59.505 --> 34:00.922
You hear this Artie?

34:00.924 --> 34:02.424
You hear it?

34:02.426 --> 34:03.844
Levon and his bag!

34:06.387 --> 34:08.804
It's an old fashioned pickup.

34:08.806 --> 34:10.391
On a motorcycle, no less.

34:14.063 --> 34:16.355
All you'd need is a pistol,

34:16.357 --> 34:19.234
a mask, good escape route,

34:21.360 --> 34:23.110
and a little nerve.

35:11.995 --> 35:13.454
Oh, shit.

35:14.873 --> 35:16.498
What's the matter?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.751
I can't get the
Chrysler building right.

35:20.254 --> 35:21.880
Looks like
New York to me.

35:22.881 --> 35:24.591
How's your crossword puzzle?

35:27.010 --> 35:28.885
Nearly done.

35:28.887 --> 35:29.803
Good.

35:29.805 --> 35:31.471
You want eggplant for dinner?

35:31.473 --> 35:32.514
Sure.

35:49.657 --> 35:52.409
Hey Boe, I left a
half a turkey sandwich,

35:52.411 --> 35:53.952
for ya in the kitchen.

35:53.954 --> 35:54.954
Alright,

35:55.663 --> 35:56.454
okay.

35:56.456 --> 35:58.206
I'll see ya tomorrow.

37:01.604 --> 37:03.313
You never seen that picture?

37:03.315 --> 37:04.105
No.

37:04.107 --> 37:05.689
Well it's fabulous.

37:05.691 --> 37:09.569
Glen Ford plays this bad guy,

37:09.571 --> 37:10.862
turns out to be this
charming son of a bitch.

37:13.741 --> 37:15.242
it's a classic.

37:16.161 --> 37:17.578
We'll get it from the Net flick.

37:18.579 --> 37:19.664
Yeah hello.

37:21.583 --> 37:22.832
Yeah this is Artie Twine.

37:22.834 --> 37:23.834
Whose this?

37:25.753 --> 37:26.753
Yeah one sec.

37:28.090 --> 37:29.339
Says he's your grandson.

37:29.341 --> 37:30.673
You got a grandson?

37:30.675 --> 37:32.217
Maybe.

37:32.219 --> 37:33.717
How'd he find me?

37:33.719 --> 37:35.180
How'd you get my number?

37:38.809 --> 37:40.642
He says he gave his
I.D. to the prison,

37:40.644 --> 37:42.602
and they gave him my info.

37:44.314 --> 37:45.105
What does he want?

37:54.032 --> 37:55.991
Yeah,

37:55.993 --> 37:57.951
Yeah, this is he.

37:57.953 --> 38:00.745
And you're Frank's son right?

38:00.747 --> 38:02.205
Freddie?

38:02.207 --> 38:06.334
Yeah, that was my father's name.

38:06.336 --> 38:09.296
I hope you've had better
luck with it than he did.

38:09.298 --> 38:10.671
So what's going on?

38:35.699 --> 38:36.948
What a cute couple hey.

38:36.950 --> 38:37.907
How you doin?

38:37.909 --> 38:38.825
Mr. Twine?

38:38.827 --> 38:39.826
No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:39.828 --> 38:40.618
Not Mr. Twine.

38:40.620 --> 38:41.786
It's Artie, Artie.

38:41.788 --> 38:42.954
Come on, come on, come on in.

38:42.956 --> 38:43.746
Boe's washing up.

38:43.748 --> 38:44.791
Boe!

38:47.794 --> 38:49.002
It smells delicious in here.

38:49.004 --> 38:50.295
Oh thank you, dear.

38:50.297 --> 38:51.754
Uh, Artie, this
is my fiancee Robin.

38:51.756 --> 38:54.591
Oh hello fiance Robin.

38:54.593 --> 38:55.925
Thanks a million
for having us.

38:55.927 --> 38:57.552
Oh please please,

38:57.554 --> 38:58.178
come on, we're gonna have
a fabulous dinner here.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.180
Hi.

39:01.975 --> 39:03.391
Hi!

39:08.357 --> 39:10.148
Dad always had
some scam going.

39:10.150 --> 39:12.108
There was a Christmas eve I was,

39:12.110 --> 39:13.652
eight or nine, he had
me with him selling,

39:13.654 --> 39:14.735
a truck load of televisions.

39:14.737 --> 39:16.863
I helped him load
it and everything.

39:16.865 --> 39:20.075
Got a little Schwarzenegger
here, lifting televisions.

39:20.077 --> 39:21.869
They were actually just boxes.

39:21.871 --> 39:24.245
The thing of it was he had
all these brand new boxes but,

39:24.247 --> 39:25.706
we didn't have any televisions.

39:26.876 --> 39:28.291
Where'd you get the boxes?

39:28.293 --> 39:31.878
He raided the dumpster of
news station, in Studio City.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.380
Apparently he'd been
eyeing the place,

39:33.382 --> 39:35.340
to nab it for some equipment,

39:35.342 --> 39:36.633
but it was like a fortress,

39:36.635 --> 39:37.885
there was cameras
everywhere and shit.

39:37.887 --> 39:39.427
One day though, he
sees they're dumping,

39:39.429 --> 39:41.763
all these brand new boxes,
and he gets an idea.

39:41.765 --> 39:43.390
That's so cool.

39:43.392 --> 39:45.766
He must have been broke,
because looking back on it now,

39:45.768 --> 39:47.727
it was a hell of a risk.

39:47.729 --> 39:50.689
We hooked up with this
guy in Orange County.

39:50.691 --> 39:52.065
Dad shows him the
truck full of boxes,

39:52.067 --> 39:53.650
everything's on the up and up.

39:53.652 --> 39:56.069
We put cinder blocks in
the ones along the outside,

39:56.071 --> 39:57.904
so the weight felt right,

39:57.906 --> 40:00.740
and in one we put our own TV
from the goddamn living room.

40:00.742 --> 40:02.783
It wasn't even the same
model as the one on the box,

40:02.785 --> 40:05.745
but we polished it
like it was brand new,

40:05.747 --> 40:08.123
and it was passable.

40:08.125 --> 40:10.750
Dad opens the box,
gives the guy a peek,

40:10.752 --> 40:12.669
some bullshit about
how it's Christmas Eve,

40:12.671 --> 40:13.753
and he's got his kid with him,

40:13.755 --> 40:15.588
and if we could make this fast.

40:15.590 --> 40:16.924
I mean if the guy had
looked into one more box,

40:16.926 --> 40:18.383
the game would have been
over for the both of us,

40:18.385 --> 40:20.803
but fuck if he had met
his asking price in cash,

40:20.805 --> 40:22.721
and thanked us for the bargain.

40:22.723 --> 40:23.763
Damn.

40:23.765 --> 40:24.806
That takes some balls.

40:24.808 --> 40:26.266
Huh, Boe?

40:26.268 --> 40:27.725
Cute little Freddie.

40:27.727 --> 40:28.726
Were you scared?

40:28.728 --> 40:30.645
Nah, it was great.

40:30.647 --> 40:32.272
Mom picked us up afterwards,

40:32.274 --> 40:33.732
and we went to Denny's,

40:33.734 --> 40:35.400
and then after that
we went to K-Mart.

40:35.402 --> 40:37.779
I got like twenty Ninja
Turtle action figures.

40:39.698 --> 40:40.488
He was a good guy.

40:40.490 --> 40:42.781
I know it sounds bad,

40:42.783 --> 40:46.911
takin his kid with him
to do shady things but,

40:46.913 --> 40:48.621
he was just trying to
give me a good Christmas.

40:48.623 --> 40:49.831
He only ever knew one way
of doing things, you know?

40:49.833 --> 40:51.668
It was cops killed him?

40:54.921 --> 40:55.923
Yeah.

40:57.090 --> 40:59.716
During or coming out?

40:59.718 --> 41:00.717
Coming out.

41:00.719 --> 41:01.719
In the parking lot.

41:03.054 --> 41:04.847
Who shot first?

41:04.849 --> 41:05.849
I don't know.

41:07.434 --> 41:08.477
They say he did.

41:11.813 --> 41:13.148
He kill anyone?

41:14.316 --> 41:15.316
One cop, yeah.

41:29.916 --> 41:33.876
Everyone through picking, or
should we have some dessert?

41:33.878 --> 41:36.962
Artie, this cake is dreamy.

41:36.964 --> 41:41.674
Use the whole can of
frosting, it is a special night.

41:41.676 --> 41:43.760
Aren't you just
the cutest thing?

41:43.762 --> 41:44.762
Little old me?

41:45.972 --> 41:48.306
You have a great
energy about you,

41:48.308 --> 41:49.935
Artie, I mean it.

41:51.311 --> 41:53.478
What did you do
before you retired?

41:53.480 --> 41:54.480
Armed robbery.

41:59.653 --> 42:03.321
I didn't keep the original
when it was in the paper but,

42:03.323 --> 42:04.906
Robin went on the
internet and printed it.

42:08.078 --> 42:09.204
It was in the Tribune.

42:11.414 --> 42:13.790
My mom's family
is in Illinois so,

42:13.792 --> 42:15.042
when she got sick,

42:15.044 --> 42:16.125
I went out there with her.

42:16.127 --> 42:17.669
Dreary goddamn
place if you ask me,

42:17.671 --> 42:20.547
but the banks are plenty
warm and welcoming.

42:20.549 --> 42:22.340
How much you run off with?

42:22.342 --> 42:23.342
Not enough.

42:24.469 --> 42:27.178
Well, no shortage
of banks in L.A.

42:27.180 --> 42:29.138
No, but people change.

42:29.140 --> 42:30.098
They get smarter.

42:30.100 --> 42:31.643
That's what I'm trying to do.

42:32.686 --> 42:34.063
Look the point is,

42:36.773 --> 42:38.858
if I'm putting you in a
strange spot just by asking,

42:38.860 --> 42:40.608
you say so, I'll keep
my mouth shut about it.

42:40.610 --> 42:42.195
You got my word on that okay.

42:43.154 --> 42:44.155
Okay.

42:48.493 --> 42:51.202
The girl and I are
looking for a job.

42:51.204 --> 42:52.662
The girl?

42:52.664 --> 42:53.831
It's her idea, practically.

42:53.833 --> 42:54.875
She's the outlaw type.

42:57.752 --> 43:00.253
Any dip-shit with a gun
can go into a liquor store,

43:00.255 --> 43:01.671
but there's a way to do things,

43:01.673 --> 43:03.506
and there's a way to do things.

43:03.508 --> 43:06.303
So I guess what I'm asking is,

43:07.805 --> 43:09.472
you got any bright
ideas, grandpa?

43:18.941 --> 43:19.941
Oh my.

43:21.359 --> 43:22.987
Do you believe in God?

43:23.945 --> 43:24.987
What?

43:25.989 --> 43:26.990
Cake time!

43:33.204 --> 43:35.079
I hear gunfire.

43:35.081 --> 43:37.833
I'll know it went bad.

43:54.852 --> 43:55.852
Art.

43:59.857 --> 44:02.149
Artie, you going to bed?

45:16.307 --> 45:17.852
You hear that?

45:19.269 --> 45:20.269
No.

45:24.774 --> 45:26.986
Why you sitting over
there by the window?

45:30.697 --> 45:32.114
I'm not.

45:32.116 --> 45:33.907
I'm going to bed.

45:41.332 --> 45:42.331
What the fuck?

45:48.798 --> 45:51.424
You hear that
commotion last night?

45:51.426 --> 45:53.760
Yeah, helicopters,
sirens all that shit.

45:53.762 --> 45:55.971
Something went down.

45:55.973 --> 45:58.100
I think it was your
little friend Levon.

45:59.392 --> 46:01.101
My little friend?

46:01.103 --> 46:03.519
Yeah Levon, across the street.

46:03.521 --> 46:05.521
I went out for the
newspaper this morning,

46:05.523 --> 46:08.025
and he's gotta bunch of
gangster buddies on his lawn.

46:08.027 --> 46:11.069
I think he's gathered
himself a posse.

46:11.071 --> 46:13.282
You want some cheese?

46:16.367 --> 46:18.160
That was the back door.

46:18.162 --> 46:19.078
I'll get it.

46:22.624 --> 46:23.539
Ah it's the kids.

46:28.297 --> 46:29.213
Is everything alright?

46:29.215 --> 46:30.505
No, can we come in?

46:30.507 --> 46:32.215
What did I say about gunfire?

46:32.217 --> 46:33.132
They started it.

46:39.308 --> 46:41.142
Okay I'm just gonna
take a little look.

46:47.900 --> 46:50.818
It's bleeding less
than it was last night.

46:50.820 --> 46:51.985
The bullet wasn't that deep.

46:51.987 --> 46:53.238
I took it out with tweezers.

46:57.201 --> 46:59.408
How much have you had
to drink, sweetheart?

46:59.410 --> 47:01.203
I don't know.

47:01.205 --> 47:02.121
It hurts.

47:02.123 --> 47:04.124
Okay, no more, no more.

47:05.375 --> 47:07.334
The kid on the
bike pulled a gun?

47:07.336 --> 47:09.002
No there was
someone else was there.

47:09.004 --> 47:10.295
Someone else?

47:10.297 --> 47:12.131
I watched that drop
every week for a year.

47:12.133 --> 47:13.714
Well, someone else
was watching it too,

47:13.716 --> 47:15.299
and you missed it. We
had the loot ready to go,

47:15.301 --> 47:16.592
and some nigger
comes out of nowhere,

47:16.594 --> 47:18.678
with a fucking gun,
blasting shit up.

47:18.680 --> 47:19.847
Don't call him that.

47:19.849 --> 47:20.721
He shot you!

47:20.723 --> 47:22.308
It doesn't matter.

47:25.436 --> 47:26.436
A nigger?

47:27.940 --> 47:29.564
I tried unloaded on
him, but it was dark.

47:29.566 --> 47:31.566
Robin took the guy on the
bike out with the shotgun,

47:31.568 --> 47:34.152
I just threw her over my
shoulder and got out of there.

47:34.154 --> 47:35.319
With the loot.

47:35.321 --> 47:36.363
That's right, baby.

47:36.365 --> 47:38.365
With the loot.

47:38.367 --> 47:39.727
We need to get
her to a hospital.

47:41.661 --> 47:42.451
No, Artie.

47:42.453 --> 47:43.873
You've got to, honey.

47:45.748 --> 47:47.916
We gotta call an ambulance, now.

47:47.918 --> 47:50.294
She goes to the hospital,
she's going to jail.

47:50.296 --> 47:51.335
No hospital.

47:51.337 --> 47:52.628
I've been trying to
take her all night.

47:52.630 --> 47:53.421
She doesn't want to go.

47:53.423 --> 47:55.715
We gotta force her.

47:55.717 --> 47:56.925
The bullet's out.

47:56.927 --> 47:58.135
She stops bleeding
maybe she'll get better.

47:58.137 --> 47:59.386
What if it doesn't
stop bleeding?

47:59.388 --> 48:00.846
What if you didn't
get the whole bullet?

48:00.848 --> 48:02.055
I could sew her up.

48:02.057 --> 48:03.639
I've done it before.

48:03.641 --> 48:05.893
She could be bleeding inside.

48:05.895 --> 48:07.019
She could have a heart attack,

48:07.021 --> 48:07.936
drop dead.

48:07.938 --> 48:09.604
We gotta call an ambulance now.

48:09.606 --> 48:11.190
She doesn't want it,

48:11.192 --> 48:12.732
and I don't blame her.

48:12.734 --> 48:14.567
It's asking to get locked up.

48:14.569 --> 48:15.861
She doesn't know
the trouble she's in.

48:15.863 --> 48:16.904
She could have an infection,

48:16.906 --> 48:19.280
she could go into septic shock.

48:19.282 --> 48:22.075
Well, you got
antibiotics, right?

48:22.077 --> 48:23.368
Yeah.

48:23.370 --> 48:24.452
From when you had
walking pneumonia.

48:24.454 --> 48:25.369
So.

48:25.371 --> 48:26.830
We'll give them to her,

48:26.832 --> 48:28.206
and I could sew her up proper.

48:28.208 --> 48:30.044
I've done it before.

48:32.171 --> 48:34.046
If she's looking worse tomorrow,

48:34.048 --> 48:36.381
we convince her into
going to emergency.

48:36.383 --> 48:37.757
I mean come on,

48:37.759 --> 48:40.260
I've seen guys pull back
from way worse than this.

48:53.650 --> 48:57.194
So how does that sound
to you, young lady?

49:04.453 --> 49:05.244
Robin?

49:26.350 --> 49:27.351
How'd your wife die?

49:29.352 --> 49:31.019
Cancer.

49:31.021 --> 49:32.021
In her tits.

49:35.275 --> 49:36.276
Same with my mom.

49:39.279 --> 49:41.362
Careful.

49:41.364 --> 49:43.574
Your father had a taste
for that shit, too.

49:44.994 --> 49:48.703
And I can also get out
of hand with the booze.

49:48.705 --> 49:52.165
It kind of runs in
the family I guess.

49:52.167 --> 49:53.417
I swear to god,

49:53.419 --> 49:55.459
I'm gonna shoot that
motherfucker's dick off.

49:55.461 --> 49:56.669
Who?

49:56.671 --> 49:58.421
The black motherfucker
in the suit.

49:58.423 --> 50:01.925
Comes out of the
shadows, guns blazing?

50:01.927 --> 50:04.136
What kind of fucking evil,
bushwhacking shit is that?

50:04.138 --> 50:06.263
Yeah rough break.

50:53.937 --> 50:54.937
Hello?

50:57.107 --> 50:58.107
What?

50:59.318 --> 51:00.483
Who the fuck are you?

51:00.485 --> 51:02.152
Easy does it friend.

51:02.988 --> 51:04.488
What the fuck?

51:04.490 --> 51:05.989
Everything
okay in there?

51:05.991 --> 51:06.991
All good.

51:07.993 --> 51:09.408
Just hang loose out in front.

51:09.410 --> 51:11.744
Have fun.

51:11.746 --> 51:13.540
That's my partner
out in front.

51:15.584 --> 51:17.042
I'm a police officer.

51:17.044 --> 51:18.377
Police officer.

51:18.379 --> 51:19.546
That's right.

51:20.839 --> 51:22.339
How did you get in here?

51:22.341 --> 51:23.298
The door was open.

51:23.300 --> 51:25.008
You just can't come in here.

51:25.010 --> 51:27.928
- Well sure I can.
- I want you out of here now.

51:27.930 --> 51:29.554
No thank you.

51:29.556 --> 51:30.847
I have a few
questions to ask you.

51:30.849 --> 51:32.391
I don't give a
fuck what you want.

51:32.393 --> 51:34.228
I want you out of here now!

51:36.522 --> 51:38.980
In fact, I'm callin
the real police.

52:20.565 --> 52:21.900
Get the girl.

52:48.343 --> 52:50.844
We know whose livin
here with you.

52:50.846 --> 52:52.848
And we know his abilities.

52:55.600 --> 52:58.979
Now, my boss wants
to know three things.

53:00.481 --> 53:01.938
And if you tell me
these three things,

53:01.940 --> 53:04.359
these nails will be
the worst of your pain.

53:05.651 --> 53:06.945
They just come right out.

53:10.324 --> 53:12.492
One, where's the loot?

53:14.536 --> 53:16.495
Two,

53:16.497 --> 53:19.333
where's the masked
young men who took it?

53:20.625 --> 53:21.627
Three,

53:22.878 --> 53:24.712
where's the old dog
that planned it?

53:26.089 --> 53:27.090
Just like that.

53:28.342 --> 53:29.715
One,

53:29.717 --> 53:30.717
two,

53:31.553 --> 53:32.553
three.

53:36.433 --> 53:37.724
My turn to talk?

53:37.726 --> 53:38.726
This is your time.

53:42.563 --> 53:43.982
Okay, alright.

53:46.944 --> 53:48.028
I'm gonna come clean.

53:52.115 --> 53:54.115
What choice do I have, right?

53:54.117 --> 53:55.577
I just want some peace.

53:57.412 --> 53:59.873
I just want to go back
to my boring life.

54:01.333 --> 54:02.668
Watching TV, cooking,

54:03.710 --> 54:04.710
doing my paintings.

54:06.338 --> 54:07.672
I've got no more fight in me.

54:13.637 --> 54:14.637
Forgive me.

54:16.139 --> 54:17.766
I'm gonna tell you everything.

54:23.730 --> 54:26.358
You know Magilla Gorilla?

54:34.157 --> 54:35.741
The cartoon gorilla.

54:37.661 --> 54:39.246
Me and him robbed your boss.

54:40.789 --> 54:43.542
Magilla he wanted the money.

54:44.501 --> 54:45.501
I mean all those,

54:46.169 --> 54:47.168
little hats he wears,

54:47.170 --> 54:48.755
they're very expensive.

54:56.888 --> 54:58.974
We didn't want anybody
hurt you know but,

55:00.726 --> 55:01.727
he just went bananas.

55:31.340 --> 55:32.591
I'll never forget him.

55:34.301 --> 55:35.342
His face.

55:35.344 --> 55:38.804
Yeah, black, you said.

55:38.806 --> 55:40.848
Did I ever say what I'll
do if I ever see him again?

55:40.850 --> 55:41.848
Shoot him in the cock.

55:41.850 --> 55:43.308
You said that, too.

55:43.310 --> 55:45.602
Shoot his cock off.

55:45.604 --> 55:46.645
Whatever.

55:46.647 --> 55:47.896
Get the shovel,

55:47.898 --> 55:48.855
and get in the car.

55:48.857 --> 55:49.688
We'll stash the loot

55:49.690 --> 55:51.358
and get back to Arthur.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.651
We're just gonna
leave her here?

55:53.653 --> 55:54.864
You want to stay?

55:56.740 --> 55:58.907
No, I want to wait.

55:58.909 --> 56:00.283
I want to say something.

56:00.285 --> 56:01.534
Goodbye or something.

56:01.536 --> 56:02.410
She was my sweetheart.

56:02.412 --> 56:03.328
She was a good girl.

56:03.330 --> 56:04.245
She doesn't deserve this.

56:04.247 --> 56:05.328
This is no kind of funeral.

56:08.168 --> 56:11.086
That girl was an outlaw.

56:11.088 --> 56:13.173
Outlaws don't get funerals.

56:17.719 --> 56:18.762
They get buried.

56:27.562 --> 56:31.189
You're the real
deal, you know that?

56:31.191 --> 56:35.821
I haven't used the
drill since 1999.

56:38.615 --> 56:39.658
Ain't I lucky?

56:42.160 --> 56:44.244
Should I gag ya?

56:44.246 --> 56:46.331
You want me to tell
you how to do your job?

56:56.216 --> 56:57.800
This is your last chance,

56:57.802 --> 56:59.760
to give me the
information that I want.

57:01.221 --> 57:02.512
Motherfucker,

57:02.514 --> 57:04.892
I wouldn't even give
you my shoe size.

57:10.439 --> 57:11.606
Forgive me God.

57:13.943 --> 57:14.943
God, huh?

57:16.236 --> 57:17.737
Whoever the fuck is listening.

57:19.573 --> 57:21.491
How in fuck do
you know anyone is?

59:07.807 --> 59:08.807
Art?

59:14.229 --> 59:15.229
Artie?

59:19.985 --> 59:21.194
He's not here.

59:22.989 --> 59:24.905
Where would he have gone?

59:24.907 --> 59:26.073
Store.

59:26.075 --> 59:27.075
Movies.

59:32.372 --> 59:34.457
Nest of goddamn rats.

59:35.959 --> 59:38.751
Every Armenian gun in Glendale,

59:38.753 --> 59:40.712
assembled on their
master's lawn.

59:40.714 --> 59:43.007
We shouldn't be here.

59:43.009 --> 59:44.674
- No.
- And where the fuck is Artie?

59:44.676 --> 59:46.010
He sponges up all
of Robin's blood,

59:46.012 --> 59:47.721
and then dips into
a fucking matinee?

59:51.058 --> 59:52.682
What's this?

59:52.684 --> 59:54.020
Is that a hole?

59:55.020 --> 59:56.063
Up.

01:00:07.032 --> 01:00:09.867
What the fuck is that?

01:00:09.869 --> 01:00:11.367
That's Artie.

01:00:11.369 --> 01:00:13.119
They got him.

01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:15.455
What do you mean they
got him? Someone was in here?

01:00:15.457 --> 01:00:16.457
Yeah.

01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:18.167
Someone bad.

01:00:20.128 --> 01:00:22.131
But no worse than
me, I'll wager.

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:24.674
Where you going?

01:00:25.675 --> 01:00:26.675
Wait.

01:01:01.086 --> 01:01:02.880
Free will is a veil.

01:01:04.464 --> 01:01:05.965
What?

01:01:05.967 --> 01:01:06.967
A veil.

01:01:07.759 --> 01:01:11.097
Man moves, a train on his track.

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.975
And into the station I roll.

01:01:15.977 --> 01:01:17.644
Chugga-chugga-choo.

01:01:24.026 --> 01:01:25.818
Do you know how my father died?

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.319
- Your great grandfather?
- I don't want to know.

01:01:28.321 --> 01:01:29.989
Save it, will ya?

01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:32.157
Let's just say,

01:01:32.159 --> 01:01:33.993
it wasn't old age.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.391
She was buried 26 years.

01:01:58.476 --> 01:02:01.105
I was worried she
wouldn't function.

01:02:02.189 --> 01:02:04.522
But I greased her up good,

01:02:04.524 --> 01:02:07.150
I took her out to the desert,

01:02:07.152 --> 01:02:09.112
and she purred like a kitten.

01:02:11.698 --> 01:02:12.699
What are you doin?

01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:15.075
Giving you a chance,

01:02:15.077 --> 01:02:16.453
to keep going a little longer.

01:02:17.913 --> 01:02:21.708
And have myself a
little fun before I go.

01:02:23.626 --> 01:02:24.918
Where are you going?

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.130
Across the street.

01:02:28.007 --> 01:02:31.092
I recon a showdown with those
gangsters outta do the trick.

01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:34.429
If I've got to eat lead,

01:02:35.388 --> 01:02:37.098
I'll do it at sunset, thank you.

01:02:38.767 --> 01:02:40.269
I've always found twilight,

01:02:41.145 --> 01:02:42.938
the most peaceful time of day.

01:02:45.607 --> 01:02:48.068
Listen to me,
getting all poetic.

01:02:54.699 --> 01:02:55.824
When you hear me
getting started,

01:02:55.826 --> 01:02:58.493
high tail it out the back.

01:02:58.495 --> 01:02:59.704
You still got your mask?

01:03:00.538 --> 01:03:01.538
Put it on.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:04.459
They haven't seen your face yet.

01:03:05.585 --> 01:03:07.171
Go easy on yourself, kid.

01:03:11.842 --> 01:03:12.842
Hey, Boe.

01:03:15.261 --> 01:03:16.346
You grinning?

01:04:45.685 --> 01:04:46.685
Put your hands up.

01:04:50.231 --> 01:04:51.398
Easy friend.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400
Hands.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.778
Are you the one I tagged,

01:04:56.696 --> 01:04:57.696
with the mask?

01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.657
Turn around.

01:05:01.659 --> 01:05:03.827
Or was it your
friend that I hit?

01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:05.247
Around.

01:05:08.209 --> 01:05:09.293
Okay, okay,

01:05:11.419 --> 01:05:12.376
I'll turn around,

01:05:15.465 --> 01:05:16.926
we're just chatting, yeah?

01:05:21.013 --> 01:05:22.386
Yeah.

01:05:22.388 --> 01:05:23.889
Let's chat.

01:05:23.891 --> 01:05:24.891
You and me.

01:05:26.018 --> 01:05:27.018
Okay.

01:05:29.355 --> 01:05:30.145
Okay.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.037
I was a dangerous man.

01:07:51.121 --> 01:07:52.121
More than mean,

01:07:53.456 --> 01:07:55.042
I was heartless.

01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:57.169
Pitiless.

01:07:59.462 --> 01:08:03.840
We read about Saul, watching
the stoning of Saint Stephen,

01:08:03.842 --> 01:08:05.427
approving of his killing.

01:08:08.429 --> 01:08:09.888
I'm here to tell you, folks,

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.682
I did more than approve.

01:08:13.434 --> 01:08:14.935
In Acts we read,

01:08:14.937 --> 01:08:19.189
about the great prophet
of Damascus, Ananias.

01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:20.564
He's visited by Christ,

01:08:20.566 --> 01:08:23.193
and told to go out to the
street called Straight,

01:08:23.194 --> 01:08:26.363
and visit the blinded
Saul, and lay hands on him.

01:08:26.365 --> 01:08:27.447
Heel him.

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:29.366
And Ananias says to Christ,

01:08:29.368 --> 01:08:30.741
"This piece of work is

01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:32.828
"the one you want to be heeled?

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:34.453
"This criminal?"

01:08:34.456 --> 01:08:36.331
And how does God answer?

01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:40.167
"Don't you worry one bit.

01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:43.462
"This criminal was
chosen as an instrument

01:08:43.464 --> 01:08:49.386
"to proclaim my word to
the people of Israel.

01:08:49.388 --> 01:08:50.388
"Just watch and see,

01:08:51.514 --> 01:08:55.519
"how he's willing to
suffer for my name."

01:08:57.645 --> 01:08:59.229
We do a prison ministry
every other month,

01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:01.273
at Ironwood, in Blythe.

01:09:01.274 --> 01:09:02.607
They love your book in there.

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:04.483
Oh well that's great to hear.

01:09:04.484 --> 01:09:05.944
Those guys need it.

01:09:05.946 --> 01:09:08.196
Every Christian
inmate has got a copy.

01:09:08.198 --> 01:09:10.073
And even some of
the secular ones.

01:09:10.075 --> 01:09:11.323
I tend to think,

01:09:11.326 --> 01:09:12.658
they're only reading
the first half.

01:09:12.661 --> 01:09:13.618
That's got all the
good parts, does it?

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.618
All the action.

01:09:16.582 --> 01:09:17.621
Well it's great meeting you.

01:09:17.622 --> 01:09:18.957
Seriously thank you so much.

01:09:18.959 --> 01:09:20.542
Thanks so much.

01:09:20.544 --> 01:09:21.584
My pleasure.

01:09:21.586 --> 01:09:22.669
Thank you, God bless.

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:23.962
Thank you, thank God.

01:09:26.133 --> 01:09:27.381
Clarence dude.

01:09:27.384 --> 01:09:28.300
- Awesome talk man.
- Father Zach.

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:31.219
Thank you so much brother.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.345
Clarence this is my
really good friend,

01:09:33.348 --> 01:09:34.680
Beth Conner.

01:09:34.683 --> 01:09:36.265
Beth Conner. Well it's
a pleasure to meet you.

01:09:36.268 --> 01:09:38.100
It's so nice to
meet you, Mr. Deville.

01:09:38.103 --> 01:09:39.519
I really enjoyed that.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.479
That hour just flew by.

01:09:40.481 --> 01:09:42.604
It really hit home for Beth.

01:09:42.607 --> 01:09:44.483
She read your book also.

01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:46.276
I felt like I was
reading about my husband.

01:09:46.278 --> 01:09:49.112
That anger, that sadness.

01:09:49.113 --> 01:09:50.654
I couldn't put it down.

01:10:31.781 --> 01:10:32.781
Hey.

01:10:37.454 --> 01:10:38.454
You home?

01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:40.704
You just get up?

01:10:40.706 --> 01:10:42.290
I didn't expect
you back so early.

01:10:42.292 --> 01:10:44.708
I had to get up and
hit the road early.

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:46.669
I had to get out
of that shit hole.

01:10:46.671 --> 01:10:47.712
You make the sale?

01:10:47.714 --> 01:10:49.214
Yeah we closed.

01:10:49.216 --> 01:10:50.549
We basically closed Wednesday.

01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:51.967
I mean you know how it is,

01:10:51.969 --> 01:10:53.885
I gotta go around and hold
these fucking guys hand,

01:10:53.887 --> 01:10:55.554
through every little
element of this thing.

01:10:55.556 --> 01:10:56.556
It's such a nightmare.

01:10:57.598 --> 01:10:59.099
I'm gettin a beer.

01:10:59.101 --> 01:11:00.185
Welcome home.

01:11:10.696 --> 01:11:11.653
I want a nap.

01:11:11.655 --> 01:11:13.238
I haven't slept all night.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.282
How long of a nap?

01:11:15.284 --> 01:11:17.284
Anyone's guess.

01:11:17.286 --> 01:11:18.704
Are you gonna
be up for dinner?

01:11:20.747 --> 01:11:22.163
Sure, maybe, why?

01:11:22.165 --> 01:11:23.456
Zach's coming over.

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:26.042
In that case, call
me Rip Van Winkle.

01:11:26.044 --> 01:11:29.004
It's important you be
at this dinner, Frank.

01:11:29.006 --> 01:11:30.297
Why, he's over
here every week.

01:11:30.299 --> 01:11:31.630
He's practically
in love with you.

01:11:31.632 --> 01:11:33.717
He's my best
friend, and he's a priest.

01:11:33.719 --> 01:11:34.758
Anyway, I think he might be gay.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.802
Father Zach's gay?

01:11:35.804 --> 01:11:37.053
I don't know.

01:11:37.055 --> 01:11:37.929
I just never felt
that tension with him.

01:11:37.931 --> 01:11:39.222
Interesting.

01:11:39.224 --> 01:11:41.640
And he's not the only
one coming for dinner.

01:11:41.642 --> 01:11:43.310
Who else?

01:11:43.312 --> 01:11:44.644
You remember that book I
tried to get you to read?

01:11:44.646 --> 01:11:46.521
About the gangster
who found Jesus?

01:12:40.911 --> 01:12:41.826
What's up?

01:12:41.828 --> 01:12:42.828
How's it going, your holiness?

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:44.120
Good, this is for you.

01:12:44.122 --> 01:12:44.871
Thank you.

01:12:44.873 --> 01:12:46.122
Oh that's nice.

01:12:47.459 --> 01:12:48.458
How was Mass?

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.793
Massy.

01:12:50.795 --> 01:12:51.836
Is Frank here?

01:12:51.838 --> 01:12:53.213
He's getting dressed.

01:12:53.215 --> 01:12:55.215
Awesome.

01:12:55.217 --> 01:12:56.841
Have you had enough
red wine yet today?

01:12:56.843 --> 01:12:57.845
Never.

01:13:03.266 --> 01:13:06.353
Clarence said he'll
be here around seven.

01:13:08.313 --> 01:13:09.728
This is gonna be fun.

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.818
I don't know if fun
is the word I'd use.

01:13:16.863 --> 01:13:17.821
You're not drinking?

01:13:17.823 --> 01:13:19.114
Not tonight.

01:13:19.116 --> 01:13:20.448
Babe, you
seen my nice shoes?

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:21.366
The black ones?

01:13:21.368 --> 01:13:22.575
Yeah.

01:13:22.577 --> 01:13:23.701
Oh, hey, Father Zach.

01:13:23.703 --> 01:13:24.744
What's up, Frank.

01:13:24.746 --> 01:13:25.829
How are you?

01:13:25.831 --> 01:13:26.704
Good how are you?

01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:28.874
Good, good.

01:13:28.876 --> 01:13:30.417
Where's the uniform?

01:13:30.419 --> 01:13:31.960
It's the weekend.

01:13:31.962 --> 01:13:34.713
Priests are allowed
to wear polos?

01:13:34.715 --> 01:13:35.796
You know believe it or not,

01:13:35.798 --> 01:13:37.756
I've actually own
a bathing suit.

01:13:37.758 --> 01:13:39.551
Ha, have to see
it to believe it.

01:13:39.553 --> 01:13:41.261
He's been over
here swimming before.

01:13:41.263 --> 01:13:42.178
Hey he just kind
of looks funny,

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.097
without his uniform I think.

01:13:44.099 --> 01:13:45.723
I think this is normal.

01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:47.058
To me he looks weird,

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:48.309
when he's wearing his
collar and vestments.

01:13:48.311 --> 01:13:49.727
Oh well it's good to know,

01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:52.230
that no matter what I wear,
someone thinks I look weird.

01:13:52.232 --> 01:13:53.941
Just buggin you, Father.

01:13:53.943 --> 01:13:55.066
It's good to see you.

01:13:55.068 --> 01:13:56.946
It's good to see
you too, Frank.

01:13:57.778 --> 01:13:59.779
Thanks for having us over.

01:13:59.781 --> 01:14:01.489
Yeah, well.

01:14:01.491 --> 01:14:04.910
Beth is pumped about me
meeting this gangster-dude.

01:14:04.912 --> 01:14:06.202
Please don't let that
be the first thing,

01:14:06.204 --> 01:14:07.787
you bring up when he gets here.

01:14:07.789 --> 01:14:08.580
Okay?

01:14:08.582 --> 01:14:09.497
Please.

01:14:09.499 --> 01:14:11.416
It's fine Beth, I mean,

01:14:11.418 --> 01:14:12.751
he's not shy.

01:14:12.753 --> 01:14:14.169
You can talk about
anything you want.

01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:18.298
I'm sure he'd be happy to
discuss how far he's come.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.633
- Great should be fun.
- That's what I said.

01:14:20.635 --> 01:14:21.759
Babe, shoes?

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.011
Hall closet.

01:14:23.013 --> 01:14:24.137
You look handsome.

01:14:24.139 --> 01:14:25.513
Thank you for waking up.

01:14:25.515 --> 01:14:30.101
Thank you, will you
pour me a glass of wine?

01:14:30.103 --> 01:14:30.894
See?

01:14:30.896 --> 01:14:31.939
Fun.

01:14:36.735 --> 01:14:39.611
When the mood sets us right.

01:14:39.613 --> 01:14:41.070
You know I'm doing my thing,

01:14:41.072 --> 01:14:42.780
and she's doing her thing.

01:14:42.782 --> 01:14:44.782
And she's looking the
way that she does.

01:14:44.784 --> 01:14:47.452
Christ Father,

01:14:47.454 --> 01:14:49.955
there's no fucking thing in
the world better than that.

01:14:49.957 --> 01:14:50.957
It's like heaven.

01:14:53.002 --> 01:14:54.209
Beth is very beautiful.

01:14:54.211 --> 01:14:57.170
Inside and out.

01:14:57.172 --> 01:14:58.924
And you never?

01:15:00.383 --> 01:15:01.132
What?

01:15:01.134 --> 01:15:02.134
He's here.

01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:10.892
You're a stronger
man than I am, Father.

01:15:10.894 --> 01:15:13.228
Just different paths, Frank.

01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:15.230
Just different paths.

01:15:18.902 --> 01:15:21.030
Hello welcome.

01:15:34.668 --> 01:15:35.668
Oh, fuck.

01:15:53.395 --> 01:15:54.561
- What is going on?
- Hey.

01:15:54.563 --> 01:15:55.563
Where'd you go?

01:15:56.273 --> 01:15:57.063
That's the guy?

01:15:57.065 --> 01:15:58.356
Yeah what why?

01:15:58.358 --> 01:15:59.274
You didn't
tell me he was black.

01:15:59.276 --> 01:16:00.567
So now you're racist?

01:16:00.569 --> 01:16:01.651
How does he know us?

01:16:01.653 --> 01:16:02.569
I already told you.

01:16:02.571 --> 01:16:04.114
What are you talking about?

01:16:07.367 --> 01:16:08.157
Hiyo.

01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:09.869
Hey now.

01:16:09.871 --> 01:16:11.119
Clarence Deville.

01:16:11.121 --> 01:16:13.121
Frank Conner.

01:16:13.123 --> 01:16:15.415
You have a lovely
garage, Frank Conner.

01:16:16.293 --> 01:16:17.294
Thank you.

01:16:21.214 --> 01:16:22.630
What's going on?

01:16:22.632 --> 01:16:23.381
Sprinklers.

01:16:23.383 --> 01:16:24.591
I forgot I had them on.

01:16:24.593 --> 01:16:27.260
We're in the middle
of a drought.

01:16:27.262 --> 01:16:28.678
Well, Clarence, I
hope you're hungry.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.637
We got a lot of food.

01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:33.058
Come on let's do this.

01:16:38.523 --> 01:16:40.943
And then I felt this warm,

01:16:43.361 --> 01:16:45.071
it was like sunlight.

01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:51.451
And it was all
over my hands and,

01:16:51.453 --> 01:16:54.123
in my face and my forehead.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.876
At first it was pleasant.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.753
But then it got hot.

01:17:01.338 --> 01:17:03.546
You know like a fever.

01:17:03.548 --> 01:17:05.965
Then I looked down at my victim,

01:17:05.967 --> 01:17:07.967
and he was glowing.

01:17:07.969 --> 01:17:09.969
I mean glowing.

01:17:09.971 --> 01:17:14.098
I mean he had like the
big white light on him,

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.725
like on the Broadway show,

01:17:15.727 --> 01:17:17.687
and like he doing it solo.

01:17:19.022 --> 01:17:22.109
Then I looked up and
the ceiling was gone.

01:17:24.611 --> 01:17:25.611
Just,

01:17:26.738 --> 01:17:27.989
blackness, space.

01:17:31.284 --> 01:17:32.868
And then I saw,

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.410
the stars.

01:17:34.412 --> 01:17:35.495
I just got the chills.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.750
And there he was.

01:17:40.377 --> 01:17:43.004
Standing on top of nothing.

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:49.175
And his eyes was full of tears.

01:17:52.014 --> 01:17:53.808
Jesus of Nazareth.

01:17:55.059 --> 01:17:55.849
Yikes.

01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:56.766
Then what happened?

01:17:56.768 --> 01:17:58.184
You realized you're naked,

01:17:58.186 --> 01:17:59.853
and the big test is the next
day and you forgot to study?

01:17:59.855 --> 01:18:01.188
Frank, stop it.

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:02.021
No it's okay.

01:18:02.023 --> 01:18:03.314
It's okay.

01:18:03.316 --> 01:18:05.485
I mean funny is funny.

01:18:06.778 --> 01:18:09.195
No but this was no dream.

01:18:09.197 --> 01:18:11.364
Everything's a
dream, Clarence.

01:18:11.366 --> 01:18:13.032
Let me ask you this.

01:18:13.034 --> 01:18:14.742
The crime that you
were committing,

01:18:14.744 --> 01:18:16.244
when you met your

01:18:16.246 --> 01:18:17.330
Lord and savior.

01:18:18.373 --> 01:18:19.957
What was the crime?

01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:21.082
That is not important.

01:18:21.084 --> 01:18:22.125
It isn't?

01:18:22.127 --> 01:18:24.962
No, no, it is.

01:18:24.964 --> 01:18:27.173
It's just not appropriate
for the dinner table.

01:18:28.843 --> 01:18:29.843
We don't mind.

01:18:31.511 --> 01:18:32.343
It's okay Clarence.

01:18:32.345 --> 01:18:33.469
If you're uncomfortable,

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:34.637
you really don't have to.

01:18:34.639 --> 01:18:36.599
Oh that's okay, I'm fine.

01:18:38.059 --> 01:18:41.186
As a criminal, my
area of expertise,

01:18:41.188 --> 01:18:42.815
was gathering information.

01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:49.027
And I would hurt people in
order to get that information.

01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:52.239
I would ask them
about locations and,

01:18:52.241 --> 01:18:54.490
people, and so forth.

01:18:54.492 --> 01:18:56.036
I was the muscle.

01:18:58.998 --> 01:19:00.457
So you were beating a guy up?

01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:03.791
Was he tied down?

01:19:03.793 --> 01:19:04.709
He was.

01:19:04.711 --> 01:19:06.962
Well that's not very fair.

01:19:06.964 --> 01:19:09.088
I wasn't interested
in being fair.

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.423
You use your fists?

01:19:10.425 --> 01:19:11.215
Sometimes.

01:19:11.217 --> 01:19:12.885
That time.

01:19:12.887 --> 01:19:15.220
The time that you saw god,
were you using your fists?

01:19:15.222 --> 01:19:17.806
No I wasn't
using my fists when I saw God.

01:19:17.808 --> 01:19:19.101
What were you using?

01:19:21.102 --> 01:19:22.146
A drill.

01:19:25.565 --> 01:19:27.774
You guys just don't want
to hear the list of things,

01:19:27.776 --> 01:19:29.234
that I used as weapons.

01:19:29.236 --> 01:19:30.570
How about a hammer and nails?

01:19:31.613 --> 01:19:32.905
Sometimes.

01:19:32.907 --> 01:19:33.907
This time?

01:19:36.493 --> 01:19:37.700
Yes.

01:19:41.874 --> 01:19:44.749
So there you are,
crucifying this poor fuck,

01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:47.211
and you see Jesus.

01:19:47.213 --> 01:19:50.005
That really is
something, Clarence.

01:19:50.007 --> 01:19:52.925
Yeah it's,

01:19:52.927 --> 01:19:54.719
quite incredible.

01:20:16.283 --> 01:20:17.283
Man.

01:20:20.329 --> 01:20:21.410
Thank you, kindly.

01:20:21.412 --> 01:20:23.247
Nice and cold.

01:20:23.249 --> 01:20:24.039
Cheers.

01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:25.041
Cheers.

01:20:28.045 --> 01:20:29.546
Your wife is some cook.

01:20:30.672 --> 01:20:31.672
Sure is.

01:20:34.425 --> 01:20:35.550
You're blessed.

01:20:35.552 --> 01:20:37.302
Yeah?

01:20:37.304 --> 01:20:38.929
Don't you know it?

01:20:38.931 --> 01:20:42.141
I don't deserve her,
if that's what you mean.

01:20:42.143 --> 01:20:43.434
Well, she really loves you.

01:20:44.352 --> 01:20:45.352
How can you tell?

01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:48.690
Way she talks about you,

01:20:49.691 --> 01:20:52.109
looks at you.

01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:53.986
You're the center of that
beautiful woman's world,

01:20:53.988 --> 01:20:54.777
you know that?

01:20:54.779 --> 01:20:55.823
You got a woman?

01:21:01.327 --> 01:21:02.371
No.

01:21:07.167 --> 01:21:08.210
I'm,

01:21:10.212 --> 01:21:12.963
sorry about how things
went down at the table.

01:21:12.965 --> 01:21:16.465
I have this thing, I try
to be the class clown.

01:21:16.467 --> 01:21:18.509
Ah that's alright brother.

01:21:18.511 --> 01:21:20.178
I got a sense of humor,

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:23.683
and I know how I can
sound totally bonkers.

01:21:28.271 --> 01:21:30.438
If you don't mind
me being honest,

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.359
or taking a little
honesty from a stranger,

01:21:34.527 --> 01:21:37.488
I would like to confess
to a few things.

01:21:42.203 --> 01:21:43.954
Sounds interesting,
let's hear it.

01:21:45.122 --> 01:21:46.412
Well the thing is,

01:21:46.414 --> 01:21:51.293
I just don't get a
chance to face my crimes.

01:21:51.295 --> 01:21:55.506
You know the priest and
the ladies of the church,

01:21:58.343 --> 01:21:59.801
the believers?

01:21:59.803 --> 01:22:01.471
They tend to be easy on me.

01:22:03.015 --> 01:22:04.515
I just want to thank you, Frank.

01:22:07.436 --> 01:22:09.063
Pride before destruction.

01:22:10.397 --> 01:22:12.940
And boy oh boy,
when I'm reminded,

01:22:12.942 --> 01:22:14.818
of all the people that I hurt.

01:22:27.081 --> 01:22:29.332
Just a couple of bad
guys sitting by the pool.

01:22:47.851 --> 01:22:49.392
Do you think I should bring
them a drink or something?

01:22:49.394 --> 01:22:51.395
No leave them.

01:22:51.397 --> 01:22:53.482
You've got dishes to dry, missy.

01:22:55.525 --> 01:22:57.025
You look good in
front of the sink.

01:22:57.027 --> 01:22:58.776
All domestic.

01:22:58.778 --> 01:22:59.778
It's a shame.

01:23:00.823 --> 01:23:02.323
They have sinks
at the rectory.

01:23:10.958 --> 01:23:12.748
I know they're like
brother and sister, but,

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:14.209
I don't like it.

01:23:14.211 --> 01:23:16.211
I can't help it.

01:23:16.213 --> 01:23:17.295
Well if you ask
for my opinion,

01:23:17.297 --> 01:23:19.423
I don't think you've got
anything to worry about.

01:23:19.425 --> 01:23:21.674
Yeah you're right,
he's probably gay?

01:23:21.676 --> 01:23:24.385
No I meant that
Zach is the real deal.

01:23:24.387 --> 01:23:26.470
He's a true priest.

01:23:26.472 --> 01:23:27.806
Yeah, but they don't
cut your dick off,

01:23:27.808 --> 01:23:29.057
when you get your
collar, Clarence.

01:23:29.059 --> 01:23:30.558
Drink up.

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:50.873
Well you're not
supposed to chug it.

01:23:51.789 --> 01:23:53.417
Do you believe in God?

01:23:56.837 --> 01:23:59.795
You know, I don't
really think about it.

01:23:59.797 --> 01:24:02.259
My grandfather told me,
free will is a veil.

01:24:07.848 --> 01:24:09.764
I don't know, maybe the
old fucker was right.

01:24:09.766 --> 01:24:12.184
Maybe I do believe.

01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:14.269
Some coincidences are
just a little too big.

01:24:14.271 --> 01:24:15.272
Like which ones?

01:24:18.192 --> 01:24:20.358
You two chatterboxes
ready for dessert?

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.651
The key for me is Job.

01:24:22.653 --> 01:24:26.530
God inflicts every sort
of misfortune on Job.

01:24:26.532 --> 01:24:28.950
He takes his wife, his kids,

01:24:28.952 --> 01:24:32.371
his livelihood, his health.

01:24:32.373 --> 01:24:36.124
And still, with no
explanations for his suffering,

01:24:36.126 --> 01:24:38.417
Job remains faithful.

01:24:38.419 --> 01:24:41.380
He does not curse his creator.

01:24:41.382 --> 01:24:44.549
And they tell him
he's being punished.

01:24:44.551 --> 01:24:49.556
Think, what is it that you
did to make God so angry?

01:24:54.561 --> 01:24:55.854
What is it,

01:24:57.356 --> 01:25:00.899
that cause so much misery.

01:25:00.901 --> 01:25:04.196
And Job insists that
he did no wrong.

01:25:05.696 --> 01:25:08.739
And when God himself showed up,

01:25:08.741 --> 01:25:12.743
Job asks him, what was it?

01:25:12.745 --> 01:25:18.582
What was the point
of all this misery?

01:25:18.584 --> 01:25:20.709
And God gives his famous speech:

01:25:20.711 --> 01:25:24.339
Where were you when I,

01:25:24.341 --> 01:25:30.011
made the oceans and
filled them with water?

01:25:30.013 --> 01:25:32.514
The skies with stars?

01:25:32.516 --> 01:25:38.019
Where were you when
I made the spider,

01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:40.355
and the birds?

01:25:40.357 --> 01:25:43.482
It's normally read as
don't question God.

01:25:43.484 --> 01:25:45.610
But I take it differently.

01:25:45.612 --> 01:25:48.989
When Job asks God, why me,

01:25:48.991 --> 01:25:51.577
He didn't say,
because I said so,

01:25:53.537 --> 01:25:55.619
He says something more like:

01:25:55.621 --> 01:25:58.459
look at this mess I've made,

01:26:00.585 --> 01:26:02.961
as big as you could imagine,

01:26:02.963 --> 01:26:06.089
and as small as you can imagine.

01:26:06.091 --> 01:26:08.884
And even I can't keep track.

01:26:17.602 --> 01:26:20.061
Well, young people, this
old man got to get to bed.

01:26:20.063 --> 01:26:20.854
Oh, no!

01:26:20.856 --> 01:26:21.645
Really?

01:26:21.647 --> 01:26:22.939
You sure?

01:26:22.941 --> 01:26:24.232
Well I hate to break
up such a good time.

01:26:24.234 --> 01:26:25.525
I really enjoyed it.

01:26:25.527 --> 01:26:27.610
You've been a fine
audience, very kind,

01:26:27.612 --> 01:26:31.865
but this body isn't as
resilient as it used to be,

01:26:31.867 --> 01:26:34.492
and I've got a trek back to
Babylon tomorrow morning.

01:26:34.494 --> 01:26:36.578
Where are
you staying tonight?

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:37.536
A hotel.

01:26:37.538 --> 01:26:38.830
I'll drive you.

01:26:38.832 --> 01:26:41.291
Nonsense, I can go
ahead and call a car.

01:26:41.293 --> 01:26:42.750
Yeah right, I'll take you.

01:26:42.752 --> 01:26:43.752
Stay here.

01:26:44.922 --> 01:26:46.587
Oh, no, thanks though.

01:26:46.589 --> 01:26:48.131
Well you're already relaxed.

01:26:48.133 --> 01:26:49.299
You can stay in the guest room?

01:26:49.301 --> 01:26:50.550
That would be totally fine,

01:26:50.552 --> 01:26:52.093
if you wanted to do that.

01:26:52.095 --> 01:26:55.347
No well, you know I got
my clothes back in the room.

01:26:55.349 --> 01:26:56.724
I have yet to pack.

01:26:57.683 --> 01:26:59.267
I got to get going.

01:26:59.269 --> 01:27:01.727
We were having such a
good conversation, Clarence.

01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:02.520
That's true,

01:27:02.522 --> 01:27:04.523
and I appreciate it.

01:27:04.525 --> 01:27:07.566
I definitely will be
back for that barbecue.

01:27:07.568 --> 01:27:09.569
Let me make you
a bag of leftovers?

01:27:09.571 --> 01:27:10.569
There is so much
leftover chicken.

01:27:10.571 --> 01:27:11.613
No.

01:27:11.615 --> 01:27:13.406
No, that's okay.

01:27:13.408 --> 01:27:14.658
But I appreciate it.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.201
Okay, Well thank
you again for coming.

01:27:16.203 --> 01:27:18.203
And we had so much
fun, didn't we Frankie?

01:27:18.205 --> 01:27:20.455
Yeah so much fun. You
sure you have to go?

01:27:20.457 --> 01:27:21.665
Man, look don't make me,

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:23.544
stand here all
night and apologize.

01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:26.710
Okay well,

01:27:26.712 --> 01:27:28.546
thank you again, for coming.

01:27:28.548 --> 01:27:31.591
It was so much fun as always.

01:27:31.593 --> 01:27:32.842
Let me take you
back to the hotel.

01:27:32.844 --> 01:27:35.678
- No, I'm fine.
- Come on, I don't mind.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.680
- I'll drive you back.
- Well it's on my way.

01:27:37.682 --> 01:27:40.267
If he wants to take
him, let him take him.

01:27:40.269 --> 01:27:41.476
There's something I want,

01:27:41.478 --> 01:27:42.852
to ask your advice
about anyway, Clarence.

01:27:42.854 --> 01:27:44.271
I'll drive you
back to the hotel,

01:27:44.273 --> 01:27:46.273
we can have a
conversation, man to man,

01:27:46.275 --> 01:27:47.649
a little chat.

01:27:47.651 --> 01:27:48.651
What do you think?

01:27:50.445 --> 01:27:51.236
Alright.

01:27:58.453 --> 01:28:01.705
I liked what you
were saying about Job,

01:28:01.707 --> 01:28:04.165
and God not knowing shit.

01:28:04.167 --> 01:28:05.500
And it fits with me, you know?

01:28:05.502 --> 01:28:06.584
I've never read a
bible or nothing,

01:28:06.586 --> 01:28:09.045
but I've seen a lot
of movies on Jesus.

01:28:09.047 --> 01:28:12.757
What was it that he
said on the cross?

01:28:12.759 --> 01:28:13.842
Father,

01:28:13.844 --> 01:28:15.803
why have you forgotten me?

01:28:15.805 --> 01:28:16.636
Forgotten me?

01:28:16.638 --> 01:28:17.721
Forsaken.

01:28:17.723 --> 01:28:19.057
Forsaken, that's right.

01:28:20.183 --> 01:28:21.809
Poetic.

01:28:21.811 --> 01:28:23.729
Father, why have
you forsaken me?

01:28:24.855 --> 01:28:26.440
Even his own son too.

01:28:29.234 --> 01:28:31.735
Yeah it is an
incredible story.

01:28:31.737 --> 01:28:33.612
More than a story though,

01:28:33.614 --> 01:28:34.778
to you, I mean?

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.116
You're a believer, right.

01:28:37.242 --> 01:28:38.242
I am.

01:28:43.664 --> 01:28:45.498
Excuse me.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.002
You're a sleepy believer, huh?

01:28:49.171 --> 01:28:52.505
Yeah I guess
it's just old age.

01:28:52.507 --> 01:28:55.676
After eight o' clock
I'm sleepy as a dog.

01:28:57.971 --> 01:28:59.471
Go ahead and rest your eyes.

01:28:59.473 --> 01:29:00.721
You've got twenty
minutes til we get there.

01:29:00.723 --> 01:29:03.141
I'll wake you up when
we get to the hotel.

01:29:03.143 --> 01:29:05.268
There was something you
wanted to ask me? Something.

01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:07.189
No, I just felt like
going for a drive.

01:29:37.511 --> 01:29:39.594
God, I
must have fell asleep.

01:29:39.596 --> 01:29:40.596
You did.

01:29:42.724 --> 01:29:44.476
Are we at the hotel?

01:29:45.686 --> 01:29:46.686
No.

01:29:55.237 --> 01:29:56.319
What is this?

01:29:56.321 --> 01:29:57.321
Where are we?

01:29:59.366 --> 01:30:01.702
You know I almost
thought you knew.

01:30:06.874 --> 01:30:10.333
You're just so goddamn
genuine, Clarence.

01:30:10.335 --> 01:30:11.668
I almost starting
laughing when I listened,

01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:13.962
to you go on about Artie
and his sense of humor.

01:30:13.964 --> 01:30:14.964
Artie?

01:30:16.716 --> 01:30:17.927
Arthur Twine.

01:30:19.636 --> 01:30:21.889
The man you crucified
the night you met God.

01:30:22.973 --> 01:30:25.014
I never said his name.

01:30:25.016 --> 01:30:26.016
No, you didn't.

01:30:27.853 --> 01:30:29.269
Frank, what is happening man?

01:30:29.271 --> 01:30:30.437
Where you going with this?

01:30:30.439 --> 01:30:31.439
My name's Fred.

01:30:32.733 --> 01:30:34.065
Fred Carroll.

01:30:34.067 --> 01:30:35.820
My grandfather's Boe Carroll.

01:30:38.447 --> 01:30:40.321
I don't want you to be scared.

01:30:40.323 --> 01:30:42.157
And I know it's scary
just saying that,

01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:45.410
but I mean it, you have
nothing to be afraid of.

01:30:45.412 --> 01:30:46.496
Open the glove box.

01:30:51.084 --> 01:30:52.584
Why?

01:30:52.586 --> 01:30:53.710
- What's in there?
- Nothing to be afraid of.

01:30:53.712 --> 01:30:54.712
Just open the glove box.

01:31:15.275 --> 01:31:16.275
A gun?

01:31:17.277 --> 01:31:18.276
Your gun.

01:31:18.278 --> 01:31:19.279
Do you recognize it?

01:31:22.157 --> 01:31:26.576
Many guns look the same.

01:31:26.578 --> 01:31:27.744
The satchel.

01:31:27.746 --> 01:31:28.746
Take a look inside.

01:31:59.821 --> 01:32:00.903
Oh God.

01:32:00.905 --> 01:32:03.238
Let's just try to stay calm.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.656
My heart is pounding.

01:32:04.658 --> 01:32:06.825
Let's handle this
like gentlemen.

01:32:06.827 --> 01:32:08.117
Like Christians.

01:32:12.707 --> 01:32:16.918
It kind of feels like
an old samurai movie.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.964
Like a western.

01:32:19.214 --> 01:32:20.672
Two gunslingers,

01:32:20.674 --> 01:32:22.298
with a blood feud between them,

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.759
and only one way to settle it.

01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:27.554
Don't do this man, I beg you.

01:32:27.556 --> 01:32:28.806
You know if it was me,

01:32:28.808 --> 01:32:30.348
you killed that night
instead of Robin,

01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:31.852
she'd have shot you by the pool.

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:34.854
The gun is loaded.

01:33:33.622 --> 01:33:34.622
Turn around.

01:33:36.416 --> 01:33:38.750
Why, what
are you gonna do?

01:33:38.752 --> 01:33:40.335
Turn around.

01:33:56.145 --> 01:33:57.520
I forgive you man.

01:33:59.522 --> 01:34:01.147
I forgive you.

01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:02.317
I forgive you.

01:34:05.029 --> 01:34:06.277
Don't you hear me?

01:34:06.279 --> 01:34:07.362
I forgive you.

01:34:07.364 --> 01:34:08.529
I forgive you.

01:36:03.064 --> 01:36:03.896
Oh, hi.

01:36:03.898 --> 01:36:04.938
Hey.

01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.067
How was your ride?

01:36:06.984 --> 01:36:08.192
So good.

01:36:08.194 --> 01:36:09.194
Good.

01:36:11.529 --> 01:36:12.821
I love you.

01:36:12.823 --> 01:36:15.115
I love you.

01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:18.285
I'm gonna
be good for you.

01:36:18.287 --> 01:36:20.078
I'm gonna be good.

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.207
Oh, baby, you are good.

01:36:38.015 --> 01:36:42.642
I'm sorry.

01:36:42.644 --> 01:36:47.647
I'm sorry.

01:36:47.649 --> 01:36:48.649
I'm sorry.

01:36:52.988 --> 01:36:55.238
I'm sorry.
