00:36.065 --> 00:37.532
(Anya grunts)

00:41.470 --> 00:43.972
(woman crying)

00:51.614 --> 00:52.814
It's okay.

00:53.683 --> 00:55.651
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:55.652 --> 00:58.119
There are people looking for us.

00:59.555 --> 01:01.623
They're gonna find us.

01:02.491 --> 01:04.827
(women crying)

01:04.828 --> 01:07.462
All of us.

01:08.197 --> 01:09.732
DAISY: <i>Oh, God.</i>

01:09.733 --> 01:11.968
Maybe if I don't look
at it, it'll go away.

01:11.969 --> 01:13.703
MATT: Yeah, welcome to hell week.

01:13.704 --> 01:15.938
Oh, I mean, we've seen worse
than a Congressional budget

01:15.939 --> 01:18.407
justification lately,
but yeah, not fun.

01:18.408 --> 01:19.774
Sorry.

01:20.609 --> 01:22.111
How are you doing with the whole...

01:22.112 --> 01:24.524
Guy I was dating getting
poisoned by some nefarious agent

01:24.525 --> 01:25.181
still at large?

01:25.182 --> 01:26.482
- Yeah.
- Not great.

01:26.483 --> 01:28.317
But thanks for asking.

01:28.318 --> 01:31.087
Hey, do we know anything more
about the arms smuggling thing

01:31.088 --> 01:32.822
he was investigating?

01:32.823 --> 01:36.058
Jim Fox has submitted to a full
investigation of his finances

01:36.059 --> 01:37.426
to help the FBI and CIA

01:37.427 --> 01:39.862
determine who was paying his retainer.

01:39.863 --> 01:41.731
Beyond that, we're still in the dark.

01:41.732 --> 01:44.500
But bending toward the
happier glow of our annual

01:44.501 --> 01:46.182
budget justification,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:46.183 --> 01:47.566
ELIZABETH: Good morning, everyone.

01:47.567 --> 01:48.471
ALL: Good morning.

01:48.472 --> 01:51.874
Who's ready to take refuge
in the comfort of numbers?

01:51.875 --> 01:53.342
Pretty cold comfort.

01:53.343 --> 01:54.610
As you've seen,

01:54.611 --> 01:57.613
we're looking at some major
reductions this year.

01:57.614 --> 01:59.281
MATT: <i>This</i> year?

01:59.282 --> 02:01.684
More so than in previous years.

02:01.685 --> 02:03.686
ELIZABETH: Still spreading
the ample wealth

02:03.687 --> 02:08.157
of the world's largest economy
on peace and prosperity.

02:08.157 --> 02:10.425
NADINE: In anticipation
of the congressional

02:10.426 --> 02:12.928
belt-tightening imposed
on many departments.

02:12.929 --> 02:14.363
Not as much as ours.

02:14.364 --> 02:16.265
MATT: Sorry, but almost a billion less

02:16.266 --> 02:18.868
for international peacekeeping efforts?

02:18.869 --> 02:20.903
And how many new fighter
jets is Defense getting?

02:20.904 --> 02:22.338
NADINE: The new Congress

02:22.339 --> 02:25.574
is making efficiency its top priority.

02:25.575 --> 02:26.909
MATT: Yeah, at the expense

02:26.910 --> 02:28.377
of a fully funded arms control

02:28.378 --> 02:30.012
and international security program.

02:30.013 --> 02:31.947
JAY: It's punishment;
they didn't want Dalton,

02:31.948 --> 02:33.949
you did, and this is how
they're gonna make us pay.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.093
ELIZABETH: Before we go full

02:35.094 --> 02:37.887
conspiracy theory, can we just focus

02:37.888 --> 02:39.355
on making our case to Congress?

02:39.356 --> 02:40.856
Uh, ma'am, FBI Director Doherty

02:40.857 --> 02:42.124
is requesting a meeting.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.794
Uh, tell him I've got
some time this afternoon.

02:44.795 --> 02:46.861
Ma'am, FBI Director
Doherty is on his way up.

02:50.433 --> 02:54.003
FBI's Hostage Rescue Team has
been coordinating a crackdown

02:54.004 --> 02:57.506
on human trafficking in Central
Asia for about six months.

02:57.507 --> 02:58.874
We're just about ready to go in,

02:58.875 --> 03:01.010
but Kyrgyzstan isn't cooperating.

03:01.011 --> 03:04.313
That new president, Nogoyev.

03:04.314 --> 03:07.917
He's not playing ball with
the crackdown, I'm guessing?

03:07.918 --> 03:11.720
According to him, they've got
human trafficking under control.

03:11.721 --> 03:12.655
(scoffs)

03:12.656 --> 03:14.557
Has he read the latest report?

03:14.558 --> 03:16.225
The child trafficking is appalling,

03:16.226 --> 03:19.128
seems their police force is in on it,

03:19.129 --> 03:20.896
it's like staring into an abyss.

03:20.897 --> 03:24.333
There may be an angle that's useful.

03:24.334 --> 03:28.037
Yesterday, CYBERCOM
intercepted some files in transit,

03:28.038 --> 03:30.339
originating in Kyrgyzstan.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.141
We found this.

03:32.142 --> 03:34.143
LARA (over video): I'm an American.

03:34.144 --> 03:37.213
I like basketball,

03:37.214 --> 03:40.548
drawing and children.

03:42.585 --> 03:44.954
I take care of kids through my church.

03:44.955 --> 03:48.023
That's Lara Cramer?

03:48.024 --> 03:51.060
I-I barely recognize her.

03:51.061 --> 03:53.262
Almost a year in captivity.

03:53.263 --> 03:55.030
This video is a sales tool

03:55.031 --> 03:56.298
for potential buyers.

03:56.299 --> 03:58.868
Probably Islamic radicals in Syria.

03:58.869 --> 04:02.571
Which means she might not
be in Kyrgyzstan much longer.

04:02.572 --> 04:04.406
If she hasn't been sold already.

04:04.407 --> 04:06.942
(inhales, exhales)

04:06.943 --> 04:09.278
So we're hoping that President Nogoyev,

04:09.279 --> 04:12.448
a guy who seems unbothered
by child trafficking,

04:12.449 --> 04:17.019
will somehow be moved by one
kidnapped American aid worker?

04:17.019 --> 04:20.322
He's motivated by ego.

04:20.322 --> 04:25.461
If he gets the chance to play
a role in the heroic capture

04:25.462 --> 04:27.229
of an internationally renowned victim,

04:27.230 --> 04:29.265
he may be more cooperative with the FBI.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.065
Let me see what I can do.

04:35.204 --> 04:37.139
Isn't Nogoyev the Russian lapdog

04:37.140 --> 04:39.842
who outlawed free press
on the first day?

04:39.843 --> 04:42.178
And made his mother's
birthday a national holiday.

04:42.179 --> 04:43.345
Well, that would

04:43.346 --> 04:44.847
totally work on my mom.

04:44.848 --> 04:46.911
NADINE: They're looking
for more foreign investment.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.151
We could subsidize
their cotton production,

04:49.152 --> 04:51.020
invest in agricultural infrastructure.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.422
Canada tried to invest in
a gold mine a few years ago,

04:53.423 --> 04:55.006
they're still tied up in legal battles.

04:55.007 --> 04:58.227
Yeah, this guy isn't
into delayed gratification.

04:58.228 --> 04:59.629
Then I'm guessing police supervision

04:59.630 --> 05:01.613
to help with rampant
corruption isn't gonna do it?

05:01.614 --> 05:03.332
What about the oil
pipeline through India,

05:03.333 --> 05:04.733
Pakistan and Afghanistan?

05:04.734 --> 05:07.036
With Russia paying less for
oil, he might want in on that.

05:07.037 --> 05:10.439
Yeah, that's... That's something.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.208
Keep thinking on that.

05:12.209 --> 05:14.475
Nadine.

05:15.211 --> 05:16.612
LARA: ...and children.

05:16.613 --> 05:20.114
I take care of kids through my church.

05:22.785 --> 05:24.887
(exhales) Well.

05:24.888 --> 05:26.822
At least she's alive.

05:26.823 --> 05:28.190
Barely.

05:28.191 --> 05:30.993
The FBI hasn't even shown
it to her family yet.

05:30.994 --> 05:32.857
Well, the family was
threatening to sue the FBI

05:32.858 --> 05:34.663
over not paying Lara's ransom,

05:34.664 --> 05:37.099
so I'm not surprised
they're being careful.

05:37.100 --> 05:41.136
I remember you were a, uh, liaison

05:41.137 --> 05:42.680
to the parents during the negotiation.

05:42.681 --> 05:44.607
Right, of course.

05:44.608 --> 05:46.475
I'll call them right away.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.345
The FBI couldn't pinpoint a location.

05:49.346 --> 05:50.713
There's a chance

05:50.714 --> 05:54.083
she may be gone by the time
Hostage Rescue gets there.

05:54.084 --> 05:58.953
Obviously, we don't want to...
get their hopes up.

05:59.655 --> 06:01.956
Yeah.

06:03.592 --> 06:05.361
HENRY: Two VFF scouts ambushed me here,

06:05.362 --> 06:07.529
about 500 yards outside the compound.

06:07.530 --> 06:08.897
Were they expecting you?

06:08.898 --> 06:11.433
Well, it's hard to tell
with the bullets flying.

06:11.434 --> 06:13.002
Special Surveillance Group

06:13.003 --> 06:16.405
reports increased defensive
weaponry around the perimeter.

06:16.406 --> 06:18.240
They are definitely
readying for something.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.209
It's time to go in and
end this operation.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.328
We'll have to hope the
element of surprise

06:22.329 --> 06:23.712
will give our team the upper hand.

06:23.713 --> 06:25.147
I don't know.

06:25.148 --> 06:26.469
They've got a high-capacity bomb,

06:26.470 --> 06:27.470
they've been stockpiling ammo...

06:27.471 --> 06:28.517
Not saying it's ideal,

06:28.518 --> 06:30.386
but at this point, we're out of moves.

06:30.387 --> 06:32.620
We just got to get Conroy
out of there alive.

06:35.309 --> 06:36.760
ELIZABETH: <i>President Nogoyev,</i>

06:36.761 --> 06:38.361
let me be direct.

06:38.362 --> 06:41.264
The United States needs your help.

06:41.265 --> 06:44.434
This investigation
into human trafficking

06:44.435 --> 06:46.403
is a crucial undertaking
between the United States

06:46.404 --> 06:49.039
and the nations of Central Asia.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.273
And without your cooperation,

06:50.274 --> 06:53.276
the horror of women and
children being captured

06:53.277 --> 06:56.913
and sold into prostitution
and forced labor

06:56.914 --> 06:59.282
will continue unchecked.

06:59.283 --> 07:01.583
(speaking in Russian)

07:03.853 --> 07:06.389
TRANSLATOR: Madam Secretary,
what you fail to understand

07:06.390 --> 07:09.025
is that Kyrgyzstan is not like
the rest of Central Asia.

07:09.026 --> 07:11.027
We are nomads.

07:11.028 --> 07:13.562
We take care of ourselves.

07:18.601 --> 07:22.205
And we have never submitted
to any authoritarian regimes.

07:22.206 --> 07:24.007
(quietly): Except for the Soviet Union.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.975
ELIZABETH: Of course, Mr. President.

07:25.976 --> 07:27.744
And to honor Kyrgyzstan's

07:27.745 --> 07:29.245
fierce, independent spirit,

07:29.246 --> 07:31.281
we're prepared to offer
you an opportunity

07:31.282 --> 07:34.884
to strengthen your economy
by joining the I.A.P. pipeline.

07:34.885 --> 07:37.454
We have deal for oil with Russia.

07:37.455 --> 07:39.522
We do not need your pipeline.

07:39.523 --> 07:42.492
If I may point out,
President Nogoyev...

07:42.493 --> 07:44.094
Kazakhstan.

07:44.095 --> 07:45.862
They have much trafficking.

07:45.863 --> 07:47.197
Not Kyrgyzstan.

07:47.198 --> 07:48.565
Does he think we're talking
about the wrong country?

07:48.566 --> 07:51.501
ELIZABETH: We have a great deal
of evidence to the contrary,

07:51.502 --> 07:54.037
Mr. President. I'd like also to mention

07:54.038 --> 07:55.839
a very high-profile captive

07:55.840 --> 07:58.575
who's been located within your borders.

07:58.576 --> 08:02.144
Do you know <i>Chronicles of Ashkenar?</i>

08:03.713 --> 08:06.515
Uh...

08:08.752 --> 08:11.254
The fantasy book series?

08:11.255 --> 08:13.022
Yeah! They are the greatest.

08:13.023 --> 08:15.125
You have seen movies?

08:15.126 --> 08:18.360
With this girl, uh, Ashley Whittaker?

08:20.096 --> 08:24.633
I saw the first one with my son.

08:25.869 --> 08:28.471
"Tonight we dream,

08:28.472 --> 08:32.908
tomorrow we slay."

08:36.011 --> 08:38.847
Tomorrow's my birthday. Hmm?

08:38.849 --> 08:41.551
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

08:41.552 --> 08:43.986
I have big party.

08:43.988 --> 08:46.489
I invite Ashley Whittaker.

08:46.490 --> 08:50.627
I offer her a lot of money, but...

08:50.628 --> 08:52.095
she cannot come.

08:52.096 --> 08:55.465
Because a travel
advisory to Kyrgyzstan.

08:55.466 --> 08:57.600
I am sad.

08:57.601 --> 09:00.570
He is sad without Ashley.

09:00.571 --> 09:02.272
Um... (clears throat)

09:02.273 --> 09:05.041
Perhaps, if the president did more

09:05.042 --> 09:08.111
to prevent sex
trafficking in Kyrgyzstan,

09:08.112 --> 09:12.682
young actresses might be
more open to his invitations.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.516
I accept.

09:15.985 --> 09:18.021
We will work on this investigation.

09:18.022 --> 09:19.823
And Ashley comes.

09:19.824 --> 09:21.991
(Nogoyev laughs)

09:21.992 --> 09:25.028
Ashley comes.

09:25.029 --> 09:27.763
"Tomorrow we slay."

09:29.799 --> 09:32.735
Wha...

09:32.736 --> 09:33.970
What just happened?

09:33.971 --> 09:38.074
NADINE: I believe we just
made a deal to convince

09:38.075 --> 09:42.812
an actress to go to a despot's
birthday party in Central Asia

09:42.813 --> 09:46.583
so that we can combat
human trafficking.

09:46.584 --> 09:50.520
And we thought this was just
gonna be the boring budget day.

09:50.521 --> 09:52.622
- Mm.
- Tomorrow we slay.

09:52.623 --> 09:54.924
Oh.

09:54.925 --> 10:01.338
Subtitle sync and corrections by

10:04.696 --> 10:06.198
- Hello.
- Hey, hey.

10:06.199 --> 10:07.766
That was late for a budget day.

10:07.767 --> 10:11.274
Yeah, well, it turned into
a kind of different day..

10:11.275 --> 10:12.656
- Hi.
- Mm. Hi, baby.

10:13.969 --> 10:15.269
How are you feeling?

10:15.270 --> 10:17.662
Oh, pretty good.
I was just enjoying my dinner.

10:17.663 --> 10:19.798
- Ooh.
- Jason made, uh...

10:19.799 --> 10:22.534
(quietly): spaghetti. Spaghetti.

10:22.535 --> 10:24.035
Oh. Uh, ooh.

10:24.036 --> 10:25.174
- Jace.
- Yeah?

10:25.175 --> 10:27.410
What can you tell me about
Ashley Whittaker? I mean...

10:27.411 --> 10:32.548
Uh... potential for Emma Watson-
level credibility coming off

10:32.549 --> 10:34.383
a Y.A. series as
confirmed by recent casting

10:34.384 --> 10:35.551
in a Coen Brothers movie.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.253
He didn't even have
to think about that.

10:37.254 --> 10:39.021
JASON: Celebrity news.

10:39.022 --> 10:41.257
It's in the air. It's
like fungus spores

10:41.258 --> 10:42.925
you breathe and then you get

10:42.926 --> 10:44.994
giant warts on your brain. Okay.

10:44.995 --> 10:47.396
Nothing to do with how
she looks in a space suit.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.165
<i>Chronicles of Ashkenar</i>
is a future dystopia.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.566
There aren't even any space suits.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.254
I knew that.

10:51.255 --> 10:51.918
See?

10:51.919 --> 10:54.445
So, why your interest
in Ashley Whittaker?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.149
Let's just say she might
be able to help us

10:56.150 --> 10:59.048
avoid an actual future dystopia.

10:59.049 --> 10:59.662
ALISON: Hey, guys.

10:59.663 --> 11:01.030
Um, do you think that
this is too short?

11:01.031 --> 11:02.398
- Oh, my God.
- It's kind of short.

11:02.399 --> 11:03.733
- ELIZABETH: Did you make that?
- That's very short.

11:03.734 --> 11:04.775
It's for the Spring Fling.

11:04.776 --> 11:06.010
I'm going full Edie Sedgwick.

11:06.011 --> 11:07.670
Oh, you are.

11:07.671 --> 11:10.006
So, did you get asked?

11:10.007 --> 11:11.807
I asked someone, actually. Thad Newton.

11:11.808 --> 11:13.928
- Wow. Good for you. Yeah.
- HENRY: Good for you.

11:13.929 --> 11:15.278
- Thad Newton.
- What?

11:15.279 --> 11:16.892
Uh, Senator Newton's son, right?

11:16.893 --> 11:18.781
Um, the Foreign Relations Committee.

11:18.782 --> 11:21.184
Oh, God, do you think his
mom made him say yes?

11:21.185 --> 11:22.905
- ELIZABETH: No. Oh, would you...
- Well, there's got to be some explanation.

11:22.906 --> 11:25.369
- Jason. Seriously. - Why do you
have to be a jerk? - Come on.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.844
He's like some champion
swimmer Abercrombie model.

11:27.845 --> 11:30.012
I'm just being honest
about market value.

11:30.013 --> 11:31.796
- I did not make the system.
- You know what?

11:31.797 --> 11:34.250
It's fine. Stay home in
your layer of superiority.

11:34.251 --> 11:35.852
Yeah, if only.

11:35.853 --> 11:37.653
Piper asked me to go
and I had to say yes.

11:37.654 --> 11:39.357
- I knew she liked him.
- Oh, that's great.

11:39.358 --> 11:40.223
I knew that.

11:40.224 --> 11:41.391
Note that I'm saying nothing

11:41.392 --> 11:43.073
about how Piper's
clearly above your class.

11:43.074 --> 11:44.040
Yeah, just like how I'm saying

11:44.041 --> 11:45.294
nothing about this "dress."

11:45.295 --> 11:46.629
- Like, right...
- Shut up.

11:46.630 --> 11:49.432
Come on. You don't even
go to Westmore anymore.

11:49.433 --> 11:50.533
Why are you coming?

11:50.534 --> 11:51.701
JASON: Uh, last I checked,

11:51.702 --> 11:54.170
there's no border security
at a school dance.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.505
How old were you when you stopped

11:55.506 --> 11:57.096
fighting with your siblings?

11:57.097 --> 11:58.708
(chuckles) I'll let you know.

11:58.709 --> 12:00.176
(chuckles)

12:00.177 --> 12:01.440
Am I worried about Thad Newton?

12:01.441 --> 12:03.346
Not as worried as I am about Piper.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.480
Well, Piper's cool, right?

12:04.481 --> 12:07.750
Maybe a little too
"cool" for Jace, huh?

12:07.751 --> 12:09.752
Oh, come on. You weren't
too cool for me.

12:09.753 --> 12:12.789
Once I got past your desert boots.

12:12.790 --> 12:17.627
My d... well, how
about that for a boot?

12:17.628 --> 12:19.996
WOMAN: <i>How's the Pinot?</i>

12:19.997 --> 12:21.364
Oh, baby, you heard Sir Ben.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.765
Need to protect your voice.

12:22.766 --> 12:25.067
- (sighs)
- Shakespeare is very demanding.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.003
Hot water and lemon.

12:27.004 --> 12:28.805
Thank you so much for taking time

12:28.806 --> 12:30.173
out of your rehearsal schedule.

12:30.174 --> 12:31.174
Well, it isn't every day

12:31.175 --> 12:32.775
we get a call from
the State Department.

12:32.776 --> 12:34.319
We are certainly intrigued. (chuckles)

12:34.320 --> 12:37.713
I'm sorry, can I just say,
<i>A Horse for Tally?</i>

12:37.714 --> 12:38.848
Cried my eyes out.

12:38.849 --> 12:40.016
Oh, my God, you're so sweet.

12:40.017 --> 12:41.484
- Thank you.
- (chuckles) Yeah.

12:41.485 --> 12:44.120
I-I might have missed that one,
but I'm definitely a fan.

12:44.121 --> 12:45.488
DAISY: Yeah, as it turns out,

12:45.489 --> 12:48.224
so is President Kenatbek
Nogoyev of Kyrgyzstan.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.859
Oh, how nice.

12:49.860 --> 12:51.727
We understand that he invited Ashley

12:51.728 --> 12:53.329
to his birthday celebration in Bishkek.

12:53.330 --> 12:55.031
Well, Ashley gets a lot of invitations.

12:55.032 --> 12:56.075
DAISY: Of course.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.034
We're looking to improve
diplomatic relations

12:58.035 --> 13:00.603
in the region and thought
as a cultural exchange,

13:00.604 --> 13:02.371
we might be able to lift
the travel advisory

13:02.372 --> 13:03.439
for the sake of a meeting.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.909
Uh, Mom, that's the guy...

13:06.910 --> 13:08.845
He invited me awhile ago,

13:08.846 --> 13:10.513
but I just can't associate myself

13:10.514 --> 13:12.281
with the human rights situation there.

13:12.282 --> 13:13.883
It is good to know
that you're interested

13:13.884 --> 13:14.850
in human rights, Ashley,

13:14.851 --> 13:16.886
because we would like to offer you

13:16.887 --> 13:19.922
the opportunity to serve your
country on an important mission.

13:19.923 --> 13:22.692
What it would involve, actually,

13:22.693 --> 13:25.094
is accepting President
Nogoyev's birthday invitation.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.196
DAISY: And by doing that,
you'd make it possible

13:27.197 --> 13:29.298
for international law enforcement

13:29.299 --> 13:31.667
to accomplish a very important mission

13:31.668 --> 13:32.635
in Central Asia.

13:32.636 --> 13:33.939
JERI: You keep saying "mission."

13:33.940 --> 13:35.738
What's the mission?

13:35.739 --> 13:38.875
Unfortunately, we-we wouldn't be able

13:38.876 --> 13:40.843
to share the details with you.

13:40.844 --> 13:43.079
But Ashley would have
full protection, of course.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.580
Protection from what?

13:44.581 --> 13:47.350
Is this terrorism related?

13:47.351 --> 13:49.752
Again, we do need to protect
the secrecy of the mission.

13:49.753 --> 13:51.621
But what we can say is Ashley could be

13:51.622 --> 13:53.155
a part of a really big story.

13:53.156 --> 13:55.157
JERI: And in the meantime,

13:55.158 --> 13:57.627
you can guarantee
a total media blackout?

13:57.628 --> 13:59.929
As much as that's possible.

13:59.930 --> 14:01.731
I read somewhere that
a school of piranha

14:01.732 --> 14:04.500
can digest an entire
human body in seconds.

14:04.501 --> 14:05.468
You know what's faster?

14:05.469 --> 14:08.638
The Internet.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.573
One image from one
cell phone gets leaked,

14:10.574 --> 14:12.441
and Ashley's the dumb actress

14:12.442 --> 14:14.777
who went to the
dictator's birthday party.

14:14.778 --> 14:17.280
Did you see what that
did to Hilary Swank?

14:17.281 --> 14:19.782
- (cell phone beeps)
- Sorry, we can't risk it.

14:19.783 --> 14:22.818
Oh, shoot, look, there's
paparazzi outside.

14:22.819 --> 14:23.886
- Excuse me.
- (sighs)

14:23.887 --> 14:25.469
May we use a rear exit, please?

14:25.470 --> 14:27.523
We have to get back to rehearsal.

14:27.524 --> 14:28.724
If we could just follow up...

14:28.725 --> 14:30.960
Thanks so much, you guys.

14:30.961 --> 14:32.327
Come see <i>The Tempest.</i>

14:34.363 --> 14:36.632
Oh, we'll see the tempest.

14:36.633 --> 14:39.000
As soon as I call Nadine.

14:40.469 --> 14:42.737
(phone ringing)

14:46.275 --> 14:47.410
Hello?

14:47.411 --> 14:50.012
- Henry, it's me.
- Ian. Where are you?

14:50.013 --> 14:52.300
I'm at the Silverglen Mall.
They sent me on a supply run.

14:52.301 --> 14:53.965
I got about an hour.
Can you come meet me?

14:53.966 --> 14:55.152
Am I gonna get shot again?

14:55.153 --> 14:58.022
I'm sorry about that. I'll
explain it when you get here.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.464
There are hundreds of people around.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.999
I'm alone, and I don't have much time.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.558
Just come. Please.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.598
MO: Hey.

15:07.599 --> 15:09.142
HENRY: Mo, I just got a call from Ian.

15:09.143 --> 15:10.000
He's on a supply run.

15:10.001 --> 15:11.068
He wants to meet.

15:11.069 --> 15:11.753
He called?

15:11.754 --> 15:13.968
Sounds like there's a lot
going on. I'm bringing him in.

15:13.969 --> 15:15.770
Are you kidding me?
You can barely walk.

15:15.771 --> 15:16.971
I mean, what if it's a trap?

15:16.972 --> 15:19.315
Then send backup. The Silverglen Mall.

15:19.316 --> 15:22.711
And tell Marguerite this
raid needs to happen. Now.

15:22.712 --> 15:23.678
(elevator bell dings)

15:23.679 --> 15:25.747
You got rope-a-doped by the momager.

15:25.748 --> 15:27.082
Does M Sec know?

15:27.083 --> 15:28.917
She's in a meeting with Nadine.

15:28.918 --> 15:32.787
Inducements for actors is
apparently not my strong suit.

15:32.788 --> 15:35.557
I still think the President's
Fitness Council is worth a shot.

15:35.558 --> 15:37.492
Guys, this is Hollywood.

15:37.493 --> 15:40.128
I mean, the best we
got is a state dinner

15:40.129 --> 15:42.363
sitting next to a hot Canadian PM.

15:42.364 --> 15:44.265
You think that would work?

15:44.266 --> 15:45.667
Um...

15:45.668 --> 15:47.736
Hey. You're back. Great.

15:47.737 --> 15:50.038
Can I call Nogoyev?

15:50.039 --> 15:51.673
Ashley's mother had a lot of questions,

15:51.674 --> 15:53.041
none of which we could answer.

15:53.042 --> 15:54.676
Guys, FBI's been calling all morning.

15:54.677 --> 15:57.445
I got to get Kyrgyzstan on board.

15:57.446 --> 15:58.480
Tell 'em it's their <i>Argo.</i>

15:58.481 --> 15:59.581
Find something to do.

15:59.582 --> 16:01.890
She cares about human rights.

16:01.891 --> 16:04.355
But the mom doesn't want to put
her daughter's career at risk.

16:04.356 --> 16:06.155
Not to mention her life.

16:06.379 --> 16:10.215
We didn't exactly step
up for Lara Cramer.

16:10.983 --> 16:13.385
Hang on.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.320
That could be an angle we could play.

16:17.523 --> 16:20.025
You don't look as bad as I thought.

16:20.026 --> 16:21.470
You want to tell me why those guys

16:21.471 --> 16:22.728
used me for target practice?

16:22.729 --> 16:24.096
They took me off guard duty.

16:24.097 --> 16:26.265
There was no way to get word
to you before the meet.

16:26.266 --> 16:28.009
But they think you were
some dumbass hunter,

16:28.010 --> 16:29.268
so we're still good.

16:29.269 --> 16:30.636
No, we're not.

16:30.637 --> 16:31.937
I'm bringing you in.

16:31.938 --> 16:33.272
It was one screw up.

16:33.273 --> 16:35.040
I ran a tox screen.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.642
You tested positive for DMT.

16:36.643 --> 16:38.344
What?

16:38.345 --> 16:40.446
It's a psychedelic compound.
Now, look, I don't know

16:40.447 --> 16:42.314
if you're taking it
or they're dosing you,

16:42.315 --> 16:43.749
but, either way, you're compromised.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.671
I'm fully functional.
And I'm onto something big.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.975
Just give me one more day, okay?

16:46.976 --> 16:49.221
Ian, the FBI is raiding
the compound right now.

16:49.222 --> 16:50.303
- It's over.
- No.

16:50.304 --> 16:51.490
- It's over.
- No, no... The elders are off-site!

16:51.491 --> 16:52.874
- (phone rings)
- Hold on, hold on.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.960
Hey, Mo.

16:54.961 --> 16:57.096
- Hey. We're at the compound.
- (indistinct chatter)

16:57.097 --> 16:58.330
You taking any fire?

16:58.331 --> 16:59.714
They were definitely expecting us.

16:59.715 --> 17:00.499
But no casualties.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.535
There's no drone and there is no bomb.

17:02.536 --> 17:03.769
- Are you with Conroy?
- Yeah.

17:03.770 --> 17:06.672
Ask him where they put the bomb.

17:06.673 --> 17:08.906
Mo, I got to call you back.

17:09.642 --> 17:11.476
What happened?

17:13.000 --> 17:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:20.752 --> 17:22.854
IAN: What the hell?

17:24.323 --> 17:26.624
(baby crying)

17:31.130 --> 17:32.798
Wait, wait, you can't think...

17:32.799 --> 17:35.300
(grunting)

17:38.537 --> 17:39.905
(engine starts)

17:39.906 --> 17:42.173
(tires screech)

17:42.942 --> 17:44.843
Did your guys get Ian?

17:44.844 --> 17:47.307
He's in custody, but I need you
to pull over right now, Henry.

17:47.308 --> 17:49.281
No. I got to get farther out.

17:49.282 --> 17:51.649
I can get you a team, but...

17:57.990 --> 17:59.657
(tires screech)

18:21.480 --> 18:23.848
(panting)

18:33.289 --> 18:35.779
LARA: I like basketball and children.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.248
I take care of kids through my church.

18:38.249 --> 18:40.484
How did you get this?

18:40.485 --> 18:42.586
I'm sorry, that's classified.

18:42.587 --> 18:44.722
Of course.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.324
Can you at least tell me where she is?

18:47.325 --> 18:50.743
Well, unfortunately,
the file doesn't pinpoint

18:50.744 --> 18:52.429
an exact location.

18:52.430 --> 18:55.665
I can tell you only that
it came out of Kyrgyzstan.

18:56.767 --> 18:58.669
Kyrgyzstan?

18:58.670 --> 19:00.471
Kyr...

19:00.472 --> 19:04.074
You see how she mentioned
her church when they're about

19:04.075 --> 19:07.344
to sell her off to ISIS?

19:07.345 --> 19:09.146
That's my girl.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.047
(chuckles)

19:16.620 --> 19:18.389
How's Bob?

19:18.390 --> 19:20.257
Thought we might see him today.

19:20.258 --> 19:21.925
His heart's not good.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.177
I'm not gonna get his hopes up

19:24.178 --> 19:26.462
if we're just gonna let
her slip away again.

19:28.799 --> 19:31.335
Diane, uh,

19:31.336 --> 19:33.336
while you're here,

19:34.154 --> 19:36.588
I actually have a small
favor to ask you.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.207
(sighs)

19:39.777 --> 19:41.945
NADINE: Madam Secretary,
you remember Diane Cramer.

19:41.946 --> 19:43.480
- Hello.
- Hi, Diane.

19:43.481 --> 19:46.250
Diane, this is Jeri
Whittaker and, of course,

19:46.251 --> 19:47.484
Ashley Whittaker.

19:47.485 --> 19:49.319
My daughter is a big fan.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.021
Very nice to meet you.

19:51.022 --> 19:53.424
Well, I think your
daughter is just amazing.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.526
I wish she could hear you say that.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.362
I was just explaining to Mrs. Cramer,

19:58.363 --> 20:02.499
Ashley, we hope that you'll
join us on a mission to help

20:02.500 --> 20:04.701
other girls like her daughter.

20:04.702 --> 20:07.004
So is it like a hostage situation?

20:07.005 --> 20:09.740
We can't go into too much detail,

20:09.741 --> 20:11.942
but I wanted you to meet a mother

20:11.943 --> 20:14.578
whose daughter was taken by the
criminals we're trying to stop.

20:14.579 --> 20:17.114
They can't tell us anything.

20:17.115 --> 20:18.282
I know the feeling.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.918
ELIZABETH: Security
clearances are frustrating.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.986
I worked in Intelligence.

20:22.987 --> 20:27.057
There were a lot of times
I wanted to tell people things

20:27.058 --> 20:28.459
that I couldn't,

20:28.460 --> 20:30.527
not even my family.

20:30.528 --> 20:34.498
But I didn't, because
security is a bond of trust.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.733
And I hope you know, Ashley,
that we would protect you

20:36.734 --> 20:39.236
with that same bond of trust.

20:39.237 --> 20:42.072
We appreciate all the
effort you're going to.

20:42.073 --> 20:44.508
And I am so sorry

20:44.509 --> 20:46.577
for your daughter.
She's a beautiful person

20:46.578 --> 20:48.745
who doesn't deserve
what happened to her.

20:48.746 --> 20:49.880
But you understand,

20:49.881 --> 20:51.515
I have to protect my girl, too.

20:51.516 --> 20:52.549
Of course we understand.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.451
Uh, can I just say...

20:54.452 --> 20:56.887
Part of me will never
forgive these people

20:56.888 --> 20:58.956
for not paying Lara's ransom.

20:58.957 --> 21:03.026
But another part knows
they did what they had to

21:03.027 --> 21:04.828
to make sure these monsters

21:04.829 --> 21:06.717
don't take someone else's daughter.

21:06.718 --> 21:08.532
I appreciate that.

21:08.533 --> 21:11.680
But baiting sex traffickers

21:11.681 --> 21:13.114
by sending in my daughter...

21:13.115 --> 21:15.650
That's how you get them.

21:15.651 --> 21:18.018
They're saying they'll protect me.

21:19.521 --> 21:22.957
I want to go.

21:22.958 --> 21:25.292
I want to go.

21:28.351 --> 21:30.190
It happened just outside of Groveton

21:30.191 --> 21:31.791
around 2:15 this afternoon.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.894
Residents as far as Rose Hill
said they felt the explosion

21:34.895 --> 21:37.330
as a truck, loaded with a deadly bomb,

21:37.331 --> 21:39.265
drove into a field, where it exploded.

21:39.266 --> 21:40.633
I-I'm watching it right now.

21:40.634 --> 21:41.599
What the hell happened?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.403
Believe it or not,
it was damage control.

21:43.404 --> 21:44.073
Henry.

21:44.074 --> 21:45.805
I know, but I can't defend a situation

21:45.806 --> 21:47.140
where I had no choice.

21:47.141 --> 21:49.442
Then you need to find a new situation.

21:49.443 --> 21:50.643
Babe.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.178
Can you explain to me why

21:52.179 --> 21:55.749
the ethics professor...
the injured ethics professor...

21:55.750 --> 21:59.052
is the guy driving the
truck with the bomb in it?

21:59.053 --> 22:00.820
Believe me,
if I had had any other option,

22:00.821 --> 22:01.821
I would've taken it.

22:01.822 --> 22:04.424
Are you okay?

22:04.425 --> 22:06.960
(exhales) I'm fine.

22:06.961 --> 22:11.498
Really? I mean, you didn't,
you didn't re-injure something?

22:11.499 --> 22:13.533
I promise I'm just the same

22:13.534 --> 22:16.736
slightly lame guy that
you saw this morning.

22:16.737 --> 22:18.671
The mission's not in such
great shape, though.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.935
They raided the compound,
but we missed some key members.

22:20.936 --> 22:22.675
How's your asset?

22:22.676 --> 22:27.147
Let's just say it's gonna be
an interesting debrief tomorrow.

22:27.148 --> 22:28.515
The kids are here, I should go.

22:28.516 --> 22:29.516
Hey.

22:29.517 --> 22:31.418
Tell them no drinking. Not one drop,

22:31.419 --> 22:33.086
I mean it. Except for you,

22:33.087 --> 22:34.287
Jack Ryan.

22:34.288 --> 22:35.488
You should probably drink.

22:35.489 --> 22:38.024
Yeah, I'm already on
that. I love you, babe.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.959
Will you tell him

22:39.960 --> 22:42.547
- wearing sneakers to a formal event isn't
- They're fine.

22:42.548 --> 22:45.098
- even close to as cool as he thinks it is?
- They're fine.

22:45.099 --> 22:46.820
I'm a little more
concerned about the dress.

22:46.821 --> 22:48.684
- Exactly. Right?
- What's wrong with my dress?

22:48.685 --> 22:49.702
Well, it's cold outside.

22:49.703 --> 22:50.837
(phone ringing)

22:50.838 --> 22:52.672
Dad, it's an homage to André Courrèges.

22:52.673 --> 22:54.607
It's not gonna keep you warm, Noodle.

22:54.608 --> 22:56.431
You could... just wear
a sweater or something.

22:56.432 --> 22:57.911
- (door opens)
- Absolutely not.

22:57.912 --> 22:59.779
JASON: Master Newton has arrived.

22:59.780 --> 23:01.380
(sighs)

23:08.488 --> 23:10.356
Hey, Thad.

23:10.357 --> 23:12.523
- THAD: Hey.
- ALISON: Come in. You look

23:12.524 --> 23:13.570
awesome.

23:13.571 --> 23:14.883
Thanks. Cool dress.

23:14.884 --> 23:16.518
Thanks. I made it.

23:16.519 --> 23:17.820
Oh, wow.

23:17.821 --> 23:21.156
Um, come meet my dad.

23:21.157 --> 23:24.326
- You must be Thad.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. McCord.

23:24.327 --> 23:25.670
Looks like you hit a tough slope.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.598
More like a tough Prius, actually.

23:27.599 --> 23:28.766
How did you get here,

23:28.767 --> 23:30.200
- by the way?
- Oh.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.300
I drove. It's my Range
Rover right out front.

23:32.301 --> 23:33.471
Oh, nice.

23:33.472 --> 23:35.940
Uh, do you mind if I see
your driver's license, please?

23:35.941 --> 23:37.441
Sure.

23:41.613 --> 23:44.248
Thanks, buddy.

23:45.316 --> 23:47.118
- (clicks)
- Okay, you're all set.

23:47.119 --> 23:48.919
- You guys have a nice time.
- Thanks.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.724
Noodle, coat.

23:52.725 --> 23:55.026
(phone whooshes)

23:55.027 --> 23:56.561
JASON: That would be Piper.

23:56.562 --> 23:58.463
Her rideshare is here.

23:58.464 --> 24:01.399
You want her to come in
so you can scan her ID,

24:01.400 --> 24:02.534
you know, make sure it's...?

24:02.535 --> 24:03.801
- You know what?
- Yeah? No?

24:03.802 --> 24:05.703
No? That's what I thought, right.

24:05.704 --> 24:07.539
- Good.
- (laughs)

24:07.540 --> 24:09.307
(sighs)

24:09.308 --> 24:10.842
ELIZABETH: How's it going?

24:10.843 --> 24:12.544
Is Kyrgyzstan cooperating with the raids?

24:12.545 --> 24:13.621
It seems like it.

24:13.622 --> 24:16.615
Nothing on our screens, but we
heard they busted some brothels

24:16.616 --> 24:18.817
and raided two houses in Tajikistan.

24:18.818 --> 24:22.053
Not exactly the massive
crackdown we were hoping for.

24:22.054 --> 24:23.757
Several Uzbek mafia leaders
are on the run.

24:23.758 --> 24:26.280
We're tracking them to the
checkpoint at the border.

24:26.281 --> 24:27.993
- Any word on Lara Cramer?
- Nothing yet.

24:27.994 --> 24:29.661
In happier news,

24:29.662 --> 24:32.030
I have no idea how President
Nogoyev's birthday party

24:32.031 --> 24:34.282
is going because there's
zero mention of it online.

24:34.283 --> 24:35.867
MATT: 20 bucks says Nogoyev got

24:35.868 --> 24:37.369
an ice sculpture of himself.

24:37.370 --> 24:39.604
- And watch himself melt?
- (scoffs)

24:39.605 --> 24:42.674
Well, it looks like they're
approaching the checkpoint.

24:42.675 --> 24:44.285
BLAKE: These are the mafia bosses?

24:44.286 --> 24:45.570
NADINE: Yeah, in the SUVs.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.274
ELIZABETH: What's that?
What are we seeing?

24:47.275 --> 24:48.039
JAY: Bishkek police,

24:48.040 --> 24:50.141
- it looks like.
- MATT: They're blocking the operation.

24:50.142 --> 24:51.646
Mafia must have paid them off. Blake?

24:51.647 --> 24:53.113
- I'm calling Director Doherty.
- No, no, no, no, no!

24:53.114 --> 24:54.392
- DAISY: Wait. Wait. What are they doing?
- No! No! No!

24:54.393 --> 24:56.177
- The police are letting them get away?
- BLAKE: Unbelievable.

24:56.178 --> 24:57.522
ELIZABETH:
You know what? Forget Doherty.

24:57.523 --> 24:58.991
- I want President Nogoyev.
- DAISY: Uh, ma'am...

24:58.992 --> 25:00.775
I don't care about his
stupid birthday party.

25:00.776 --> 25:02.318
NADINE: No. Ma'am, you'll be putting

25:02.319 --> 25:04.515
Ashley at risk. We have
to wait until she's gone.

25:04.516 --> 25:07.149
(sighs)

25:07.989 --> 25:09.012
And you let him?

25:09.013 --> 25:10.680
Her mom's the secretary of state.

25:10.681 --> 25:11.747
What was I supposed to do?

25:11.748 --> 25:13.282
MAN: You can't take a picture

25:13.283 --> 25:15.217
of somebody's state-issued ID.
That's, like, a...

25:15.218 --> 25:17.167
...an invasion of your civil rights.

25:17.168 --> 25:18.402
THAD: Whatever.

25:18.403 --> 25:20.471
If I was her dad, I'd be paranoid, too.

25:20.472 --> 25:23.173
MAN: You should have shown him all
those crazy texts she sent you.

25:23.174 --> 25:24.341
What's with that dress?

25:24.342 --> 25:25.509
(laughs) I know, man.

25:25.510 --> 25:26.973
Like, who wears something like that?

25:26.974 --> 25:29.213
THAD: It's, like, dude,
let me work for it.

25:29.214 --> 25:31.481
(laughing)

25:37.821 --> 25:42.326
Okay, so, the embassy in
Bishkek promises they will either

25:42.327 --> 25:44.862
get Ashley safely on a plane,
or to the embassy.

25:44.863 --> 25:45.911
DAISY: On a plane.

25:45.912 --> 25:46.801
Please.

25:46.802 --> 25:49.275
Well, for what it's worth,
both NGOs think

25:49.276 --> 25:52.178
the president had nothing to do
with the police interference.

25:52.179 --> 25:54.380
At least not directly.

25:54.381 --> 25:55.128
Let me guess.

25:55.129 --> 25:58.274
He's shocked to hear there's
gambling in Casablanca.

25:58.275 --> 25:59.753
They just got a house in Kyrgyzstan.

25:59.754 --> 26:00.754
Major trafficking site.

26:00.755 --> 26:02.021
Oh.

26:03.590 --> 26:06.360
So?

26:06.361 --> 26:08.534
MATT: Ma'am, the house was empty.

26:08.535 --> 26:10.377
Looks like they got there too late.

26:10.378 --> 26:11.339
They're tracking a truck

26:11.340 --> 26:13.243
that left the site about
an hour ago. They think

26:13.244 --> 26:14.547
it has the girls in it.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.267
Probably too much to hope
that Lara's in there.

26:22.937 --> 26:24.618
- Where's the driver?
- MATT: I don't know.

26:24.619 --> 26:25.792
It's just been idling there.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.897
Probably got tipped like
everybody else and took off.

26:27.898 --> 26:30.881
Well, at least we'll rescue
whoever is inside.

26:59.524 --> 27:01.892
♪

27:15.473 --> 27:18.143
Hi.

27:18.144 --> 27:20.378
What happened?

27:20.379 --> 27:22.646
You okay?

27:23.548 --> 27:26.051
(sighs)

27:26.052 --> 27:30.422
There was a, uh... a truck.

27:30.423 --> 27:33.390
It was full of girls.

27:35.527 --> 27:37.795
They suffocated.

27:38.797 --> 27:41.098
Oh, babe.

27:45.637 --> 27:47.672
That, uh...

27:47.673 --> 27:50.307
that girl...

27:51.910 --> 27:55.013
That missionary that was
kidnapped last year...

27:55.014 --> 27:57.615
Lara Cramer.

27:57.616 --> 27:59.883
Did she...?

28:02.654 --> 28:04.922
Yeah.

28:14.628 --> 28:17.256
ALISON: Ugh. I have a headache
from that driver's cologne.

28:17.257 --> 28:18.758
Sorry you didn't get date raped.

28:18.759 --> 28:20.526
What?

28:20.527 --> 28:23.596
Nothing. Thad Newton's a jerk.

28:23.597 --> 28:25.698
You're-you're lucky he ditched you.

28:25.699 --> 28:27.633
He didn't ditch me. I ditched him.

28:27.634 --> 28:29.268
Did he say something about me?

28:29.269 --> 28:31.470
Wait. Why did you ditch him?

28:31.471 --> 28:32.905
Never mind.

28:32.906 --> 28:34.273
What did he say?

28:34.274 --> 28:37.209
Nothing. Just...

28:37.210 --> 28:40.079
dumb guy stuff about how
much you wanted him,

28:40.080 --> 28:42.481
and-and something about your dress.

28:42.482 --> 28:44.483
What age do we live in?

28:44.484 --> 28:47.420
I-I can't ask a guy out without
getting dragged to some room?

28:47.421 --> 28:49.755
Wait. What?!

28:49.756 --> 28:52.323
What did he do?

28:53.859 --> 28:56.328
He kept trying to get me into
Julia Hursky's room with him.

28:56.329 --> 29:01.599
When I finally told him to
stop, he... he got all mad.

29:03.102 --> 29:06.272
Where do they even get these ideas?

29:06.273 --> 29:08.974
Well...

29:08.975 --> 29:12.344
he said you sent him a bunch of texts

29:12.345 --> 29:13.512
or something.

29:13.513 --> 29:14.780
So, you talked to him?

29:14.781 --> 29:16.472
No. I-I was in the bathroom.

29:16.581 --> 29:17.847
And you said nothing?

29:17.848 --> 29:20.257
Come on. You heard Mom. He's a
senator's kid. I can't do...

29:20.258 --> 29:21.893
- No. Don't even.
- You know what? Last time I wanted

29:21.894 --> 29:23.161
to punch somebody for saying stuff

29:23.162 --> 29:24.429
about Stevie, Dad told me "no"!

29:24.430 --> 29:25.573
- So...
- Well, he was wrong.

29:25.574 --> 29:26.631
He's an ethics professor!

29:26.632 --> 29:27.832
Who's not a girl!

29:27.833 --> 29:29.701
I'm not saying

29:29.702 --> 29:32.870
punch him, but say something.

29:38.343 --> 29:42.247
Guys like Thad are everywhere,
but guys like you

29:42.248 --> 29:45.282
are the reason they get
away with it every day.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.823
- (loud, overlapping shouting)
- MAN: <i>Daisy?</i>

29:51.824 --> 29:53.391
Was there any offer to negotiate

29:53.392 --> 29:55.427
for Lara's release
before she was killed?

29:55.428 --> 29:58.730
Lara died along with 43 other
victims in a tragic accident.

29:58.731 --> 30:01.166
Uh, as I said,
there was no prior contact.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.683
- (overlapping chatter)
- Daisy, this morning,

30:02.683 --> 30:04.127
actress Ashley Whittaker tweeted

30:04.151 --> 30:06.137
that she "played a
crucial part" in the raid

30:06.138 --> 30:08.139
on several brothels in Kyrgyzstan.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.507
Can you elaborate?

30:09.508 --> 30:10.709
Ashley Whittaker participated

30:10.710 --> 30:12.210
in a diplomatic exchange as part

30:12.211 --> 30:14.314
of an agreement with
President Nogoyev of Kyrgyzstan.

30:14.315 --> 30:16.634
- But... - Will Ashley Whittaker
be honored for her bravery?

30:16.635 --> 30:18.458
I think you're losing
sight of the story here.

30:18.459 --> 30:21.353
The brave men and women of
the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team,

30:21.354 --> 30:24.623
Delta Force and several NGOs
liberated hundreds of victims

30:24.624 --> 30:26.524
of human trafficking in five countries.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.493
Asiya Dominjon,

30:28.494 --> 30:30.795
Zarrin Burkhanov, Sholah Karimov

30:30.796 --> 30:33.198
and many other girls you've
never heard of are alive.

30:33.199 --> 30:36.067
That doesn't diminish the
loss of Ashley Whittaker.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.936
- (loud, overlapping shouting)
- No.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.270
Not Ashley. Ashley's fine.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.705
I meant Lara.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.707
It doesn't diminish the
loss of Lara Cramer.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.676
That's my statement. Thanks, everybody.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.511
(loud, overlapping shouting)

30:46.512 --> 30:49.147
Tell me again how you got to the mall.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.716
When I heard they were
making a supply run,

30:51.717 --> 30:53.852
I volunteered, hoping we could meet.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.954
And whose truck was it?

30:55.955 --> 30:57.355
Some guy named Reed.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.024
You didn't think to look in the back?

30:59.025 --> 31:00.626
Look, I-I just wanted
to get out of there

31:00.627 --> 31:02.010
before somebody changed their mind.

31:02.011 --> 31:02.852
MO: The two elders...

31:02.853 --> 31:04.421
Abbott and Slattery... where are they?

31:04.422 --> 31:05.563
I don't know.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.600
They-they were talking about
meeting with this doctor.

31:08.601 --> 31:12.137
Um... Sanders or Saunders.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.538
What does this doctor do?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.306
HENRY: Is that where they got the DMT?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.542
- I don't know.
- When you had these visions,

31:17.543 --> 31:19.711
- what did you think was happening?
- Like I said,

31:19.712 --> 31:21.479
uh, fever, sleep deprivation,

31:21.480 --> 31:23.848
but I was able to push through that.

31:23.849 --> 31:24.824
I was in control.

31:24.825 --> 31:27.585
MO: Except they sent
you to a shopping mall

31:27.586 --> 31:29.621
with a bomb in the back of your truck.

31:29.622 --> 31:31.823
Were you in control then, Ian?

31:31.824 --> 31:34.325
No, no.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.327
They played me.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.463
And they almost...

31:38.464 --> 31:40.498
made me a suicide bomber...
that's on me.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.134
But, look, I-I know you can't trust me,

31:43.135 --> 31:46.337
but I'm telling you this
was just the beginning.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.840
Of what?

31:48.841 --> 31:52.677
I don't know.

31:52.678 --> 31:56.180
But-but you have to stop
it before it happens.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.685
(elevator bell dings)

32:00.686 --> 32:02.120
Good morning, ma'am.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.388
Morning, Nadine.

32:03.389 --> 32:06.291
I-I'm sorry. I didn't get through

32:06.292 --> 32:08.893
your budget memo.

32:08.894 --> 32:12.530
Frankly, I'm surprised
I was able to write it.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.666
I think this morning

32:14.667 --> 32:17.669
we're all gonna have
to compartmentalize.

32:17.670 --> 32:20.004
Yes. Well, um, about that.

32:20.005 --> 32:23.208
News coverage
of Lara Cramer may include

32:23.209 --> 32:27.112
- some passionate remarks by Daisy...
- I saw.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.713
from this morning's conference.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.316
She mentioned some of
the victims by name.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.417
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

32:32.418 --> 32:33.785
What happened?

32:33.786 --> 32:36.083
They started circling the story
about how Ashley Whittaker

32:36.084 --> 32:37.760
was the real hero and I lost it.

32:37.827 --> 32:40.792
All right. We'll deal at the
fallout, uh, from that later,

32:40.793 --> 32:43.561
but where's Blake?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.530
Uh, he left a message
he was running late.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.132
Blake's running late?

32:47.133 --> 32:50.200
NADINE: Yes, ma'am.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.038
ELIZABETH: Let's try to focus.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.067
NADINE: This morning's budget memo

32:56.068 --> 32:58.409
reflects some last minute changes

32:58.410 --> 32:59.878
before our hearing this afternoon.

32:59.879 --> 33:01.946
Senator McDowell

33:01.947 --> 33:05.984
is going to be challenging our
international adoption program.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.519
MATT: On what grounds?

33:07.520 --> 33:09.487
NADINE (sighing):
His office didn't say.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.791
But we'll be ready for
any and all attacks.

33:12.792 --> 33:15.193
MATT: But why? Why
should we have to defend

33:15.194 --> 33:18.596
a program that provides a
home for street kids in India?

33:18.597 --> 33:19.831
NADINE: Senator McDowell

33:19.832 --> 33:24.402
ran his campaign
on fiscal responsibility,

33:24.403 --> 33:27.672
so I'm guessing that he'll
challenge our program

33:27.673 --> 33:31.576
on the grounds that it diverts funds...

33:31.577 --> 33:33.178
Jay?

33:33.179 --> 33:35.380
I worked with his chief of
staff. He's not doing this.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.081
Stop. You can't go there.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.815
Why not?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.756
None of this is easy today.

33:44.757 --> 33:46.858
But we have a budget to pass,

33:46.859 --> 33:49.394
and we need to pull it together

33:49.395 --> 33:52.430
and fight for a lot of
programs that matter.

33:52.431 --> 33:55.133
JAY: Do they? Does any of this matter?

33:55.134 --> 33:56.997
All our big meetings and
political positioning,

33:56.998 --> 33:58.837
is any of it gonna save one person

33:58.838 --> 34:00.804
who shouldn't die today?

34:13.585 --> 34:15.280
We're still questioning VFF members,

34:15.281 --> 34:18.333
but I think we got
something good from Conroy.

34:18.335 --> 34:19.743
And you trust him?

34:19.744 --> 34:21.545
I do. Group leaders have been meeting

34:21.545 --> 34:24.114
with a doctor named
Sanders, or Saunders.

34:24.114 --> 34:26.683
We looked everywhere,
private clinics, hospitals.

34:26.684 --> 34:28.916
It's just too big of an area,
too common of a name.

34:28.917 --> 34:30.581
But when forensics
came back from the gear

34:30.581 --> 34:32.703
that was seized during the raid,
we found this.

34:32.704 --> 34:35.539
Chemical, radiological, explosives.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.974
HENRY: We also ran for bio.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.375
We found trace amounts

34:38.376 --> 34:40.610
of low pathogenic avian influenza.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.397
- How bad is that?
- So far, limited to birds.

34:43.398 --> 34:46.784
But that sent us into another direction

34:46.784 --> 34:49.284
with the name, and we got this.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.089
HENRY: Bill Zanner.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.358
Microbiologist,
Division of Select Agents

34:54.359 --> 34:56.592
and Toxins of the CDC.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.262
These guys work with the worst

34:58.263 --> 35:00.864
of the worst. Zanner's specialty

35:00.865 --> 35:03.133
is viral genetic mutation,
specifically tracking

35:03.134 --> 35:05.135
how LPAI becomes HPAI.

35:05.136 --> 35:07.705
High pathogenic avian influenza.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.139
MO: Extremely contagious.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.674
Extremely deadly.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.943
He's been working in an
off-radar lab in Oregon,

35:12.944 --> 35:14.178
until he started posting

35:14.179 --> 35:17.047
this really crazy
conspiracy stuff on the Web,

35:17.048 --> 35:19.183
and then the CDC targeted
him for investigation.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.819
MO: He disappeared before
we could even get into it,

35:21.820 --> 35:24.624
and less than a month
after he had left,

35:24.625 --> 35:26.690
they'd noticed some avian
flu missing from his lab.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.959
Now, this never happens at the CDC,

35:28.960 --> 35:30.728
and it's basically impossible...

35:30.729 --> 35:32.529
Unless you're someone
with a high clearance.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.198
He's been off the grid ever since.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.566
I think he's our guy.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.910
SANCHEZ: So we've got key members

35:36.911 --> 35:38.936
of the VFF still at large,

35:38.937 --> 35:41.472
possibly working in conjunction
with the guy most qualified

35:41.473 --> 35:43.540
to create some biological nightmare,

35:43.541 --> 35:47.810
which he may already
have in his possession?

35:50.314 --> 35:53.317
ALISON: I'm so worried about that test.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.385
Um, guys, I'll see you later, okay?

35:55.386 --> 35:56.954
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye. - Bye.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.655
What are you doing here?

35:58.656 --> 35:59.957
Hi. Uh, no.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.126
- I was just fixing something.
- Oh, my God, Jason.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.494
Come here, come here.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.628
What did you do?

36:04.629 --> 36:05.829
I was standing up for you.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.965
Just like you said;
it's what you wanted.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.266
What is that supposed to say?

36:09.267 --> 36:10.667
What? It says "slut-shamer."

36:10.668 --> 36:12.811
That's what Piper called him
when I told her about it,

36:12.812 --> 36:14.938
so I... you know.

36:14.939 --> 36:16.106
You realize

36:16.107 --> 36:17.741
that by calling him a slut-shamer,

36:17.742 --> 36:19.243
you're saying that I'm a slut.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.778
(scoffs) Well, you know what?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.017
That's an okay thing to be,

36:22.018 --> 36:25.783
because sexuality is power,
which threatens the patriarchy.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.660
- So...
- I get that Piper's got you woke,

36:28.661 --> 36:31.121
- but I wasn't being a slut at all.
- Well...

36:31.122 --> 36:33.357
- What the hell?
- Run.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.091
Run, run.

36:38.095 --> 36:40.429
Hey, Thad.

36:41.498 --> 36:44.168
Diane. Hi.

36:44.169 --> 36:47.204
It's Nadine from the State Department.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.605
Hi.

36:48.606 --> 36:51.842
Um, I-I just wanted to reach out

36:51.843 --> 36:55.379
to extend our deepest condolences

36:55.380 --> 36:59.616
for your loss of Lara.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.884
(Diane sobbing)

37:04.288 --> 37:06.290
No.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.591
(elevator bell dings)

37:19.369 --> 37:21.671
(indistinct conversations)

37:28.011 --> 37:29.746
There you are.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.210
I-I couldn't find anybody.

37:31.211 --> 37:32.692
Oh, ma'am. I-I'm so sorry I was late.

37:32.693 --> 37:33.877
No, no. Don't worry about it.

37:33.878 --> 37:36.016
I just wanted to let you
all know the good news.

37:36.017 --> 37:37.384
Foreign Relations Committee

37:37.385 --> 37:41.621
passed the State
Authorization Bill in record time.

37:42.256 --> 37:43.857
- That's great.
- ELIZABETH: Yeah.

37:43.858 --> 37:45.425
That's excellent news.

37:45.426 --> 37:47.060
Yeah.

37:47.061 --> 37:48.762
Senator McDowell backed down

37:48.763 --> 37:50.346
off the international adoption program.

37:50.347 --> 37:52.132
There's still gonna be a few cuts,

37:52.133 --> 37:56.737
but everything's getting reduced, so...

37:56.738 --> 37:58.638
I'll work on a press release.

38:02.342 --> 38:04.243
This is a win, guys.

38:12.386 --> 38:15.288
Nadine.

38:17.958 --> 38:22.129
I just got off the phone
with Diane Cramer.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.431
(sighs)

38:24.432 --> 38:27.067
That must have been hard.

38:27.068 --> 38:29.502
Uh-huh.

38:34.074 --> 38:35.909
Could I ask you to come into my office?

38:35.910 --> 38:38.145
And then bring the team with you,

38:38.146 --> 38:40.813
will you, please?

38:46.019 --> 38:48.222
(Elizabeth sighs)

38:48.223 --> 38:52.793
We've all seen the worst
of humanity in this job.

38:52.794 --> 38:54.962
Political executions,

38:54.963 --> 38:58.431
stonings, kids getting shot.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.002
So I guess I'm wondering

39:02.003 --> 39:05.806
why this is the one that's doing us in.

39:05.807 --> 39:08.008
Ma'am, I've not been myself.

39:08.009 --> 39:10.498
- I apologize about the press conference.
- I know I've not been functioning.

39:10.499 --> 39:12.279
Stop. I'm not calling anybody out

39:12.280 --> 39:14.314
or taking anybody to task.

39:14.315 --> 39:15.649
I'm...

39:15.650 --> 39:17.985
I'm really asking.

39:17.986 --> 39:20.187
Well...

39:20.188 --> 39:21.355
I'll say it.

39:21.356 --> 39:22.689
Those reporters were right.

39:22.690 --> 39:25.125
They thought we blew it, and we did.

39:25.126 --> 39:27.594
You saw those SUVs
disappear into the shadows,

39:27.595 --> 39:29.529
and they got away with it.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.298
And we just watched.

39:31.299 --> 39:34.201
I get that. I-I really do, but...

39:34.202 --> 39:36.737
BLAKE: I make binders about clean water

39:36.738 --> 39:38.772
and global food shortages,

39:38.773 --> 39:40.641
and I track phone calls,

39:40.642 --> 39:43.111
and I stay five steps ahead
of a very busy person.

39:43.112 --> 39:44.936
And when people ask what I do,

39:44.937 --> 39:48.014
I say I'm saving the world
one binder at a time.

39:49.783 --> 39:52.252
But... I don't know,

39:52.253 --> 39:54.086
maybe I'm just making binders.

39:56.056 --> 39:57.858
NADINE: It's the abyss.

39:57.859 --> 39:59.326
We can dance around it.

39:59.327 --> 40:02.362
We can call it something else
and pretend it's not there,

40:02.363 --> 40:05.832
but it is there.

40:05.833 --> 40:08.635
Look, when you came here,

40:08.636 --> 40:11.305
you broke a lot of rules.

40:11.306 --> 40:13.106
And things got done.

40:13.107 --> 40:14.908
And now, to go back

40:14.909 --> 40:17.277
to bureaucracy and budget cuts,

40:17.278 --> 40:19.211
while-while stuff like that happens...

40:21.281 --> 40:23.350
I want to slay dragons, ma'am,

40:23.351 --> 40:26.118
not play whack-a-mole with evil.

40:29.623 --> 40:33.913
Sometimes making evil have
to duck and find another hole

40:35.433 --> 40:37.296
is the best we're gonna do.

40:39.933 --> 40:44.705
Somebody sent me this after
one of the terrorist attacks.

40:44.706 --> 40:47.207
It's a poem

40:47.208 --> 40:49.676
called "Good Bones" by Maggie Smith.

40:49.677 --> 40:53.113
The last part of it goes:

40:53.114 --> 40:56.483
"Life is short and the world
is at least half terrible,

40:56.484 --> 40:58.018
"and for every kind stranger,

40:58.019 --> 41:00.187
"there is one who would break you,

41:00.188 --> 41:03.290
"though I keep this from my children.

41:03.291 --> 41:06.693
"I am trying to sell them the world.

41:06.694 --> 41:09.796
"Any decent realtor, walking
you through a real hellhole,

41:09.797 --> 41:12.933
"chirps on about good bones:

41:12.934 --> 41:15.935
This place could be beautiful, right?"

41:18.839 --> 41:23.742
"You could make this place beautiful."

41:28.495 --> 41:29.700
JASON: <i>Then Thad goes,</i>

41:29.701 --> 41:31.679
"But I'm a dude, I can't be a slut."

41:31.680 --> 41:33.014
Did you get Piper to explain it to him?

41:33.015 --> 41:34.363
ALISON: Oh, Jason doesn't need Piper.

41:34.364 --> 41:35.355
Tell him what you said.

41:35.356 --> 41:37.456
JASON: Oh. Uh, it might
have been something like,

41:37.457 --> 41:39.526
uh, "your objectification

41:39.527 --> 41:42.062
"of femininity has an expiration date,

41:42.063 --> 41:43.697
"pal, and that date

41:43.698 --> 41:44.998
might be today."

41:44.999 --> 41:46.566
Well, at least
you gave yourself an out.

41:46.567 --> 41:47.768
(laughing): And then he goes

41:47.769 --> 41:49.403
to wipe it off
and the paint is damaged.

41:49.404 --> 41:50.787
Oh, you should have seen his face.

41:50.788 --> 41:52.332
It was like I cut Samson's hair.

41:52.333 --> 41:53.934
He was like, he was like, "Oh, my God.

41:53.935 --> 41:55.602
What am I gonna tell my dad?"

41:55.603 --> 41:57.070
ALISON: And then Dean Ward shows up

41:57.071 --> 41:59.673
and she goes, "You're
trespassing on school grounds.

41:59.674 --> 42:02.045
We're gonna fill out a police
report for damaged property."

42:02.046 --> 42:03.643
HENRY: This is getting a
little bit less funny.

42:03.644 --> 42:04.867
JASON: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:04.868 --> 42:06.393
But then, but then she gets us inside,

42:06.394 --> 42:08.195
and we lay out, like,
the whole thing to her,

42:08.196 --> 42:10.831
and, um, she kind of...
like, she went, like, uh...

42:10.832 --> 42:12.015
- How-how did she do it?
- Oh.

42:12.016 --> 42:14.435
"Well, Thaddeus Newton
had it coming to him.

42:14.436 --> 42:17.204
Better that it happened
sooner rather than later."

42:17.205 --> 42:18.472
- Yes, total pass.
- She did not.

42:18.473 --> 42:19.640
Score one against the patriarchy.

42:19.641 --> 42:21.144
I don't know what got into Dean Ward.

42:21.145 --> 42:23.479
- It was amazing.
- It was an absolute moment of glory.

42:23.832 --> 42:31.332
