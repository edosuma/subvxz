00:03.800 --> 00:05.882
Angels butchering angels.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.883
No one will survive this war.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.485
It's madness.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.801
It's Bartholomew.

00:10.960 --> 00:13.327
Remember how we said
that angels are dicks?

00:13.480 --> 00:16.050
- What is that?
- It's Kevin Tran.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.766
He was a good, straight-A kid,
and then he got sucked in

00:18.920 --> 00:22.322
to all of this angel crap
and became a prophet.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.165
I don't wanna be a prophet.
Hi, Mom.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.482
- You tortured me.
- I torture all my friends.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.722
- You killed my mom!
- Did I?

00:30.920 --> 00:33.560
We told you not to talk to Crowley!
Okay, he messes with your head!

00:33.880 --> 00:36.565
Here's the first name
on your to-do list.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.081
No!

00:39.280 --> 00:42.921
There's no way Kevin's getting out
of this intact, is there?

00:44.160 --> 00:46.003
You're gonna have to trust me.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.810
I always trust you.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.648
And I always end up screwed.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.843
You didn't save me for me.
You did it for you.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.604
You didn't wanna be alone.

00:56.760 --> 01:01.527
If the situation were reversed
and I was dying...

01:01.680 --> 01:03.170
...you'd do the same thing.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.563
No, Dean...

01:09.400 --> 01:11.641
...I wouldn't.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.890
Sam!

01:57.360 --> 01:58.771
Dean?

02:08.360 --> 02:09.360
Dean?

03:02.240 --> 03:04.322
- So.
- Yep.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.481
Bunker's haunted.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.126
How is this possible?

03:17.280 --> 03:20.124
Thought you said this was the safest
place on the planet.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.567
Look, I know nothing got in.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.286
I mean, the bunker is warded
and sigiled from top to bottom.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.920
There's no way something came in
from the outside.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.607
Okay, so,
whoever's haunting us died here.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.246
What, dead Men of Letters?

03:36.600 --> 03:37.601
No, it doesn't track.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.800
I mean, we're the first people
to occupy this place in 50 years.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.087
Why would a ghost wait so long
to get its spook on?

03:44.280 --> 03:46.601
Must have been a more recent death.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.285
No.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.130
How can you be sure?

03:52.280 --> 03:55.602
Because I burned his body myself!
Okay? It's not him.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.966
Okay, so you cremated him.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.804
We cremated Bobby, too,
and he came back.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.123
Sam, I'm telling you.
This ghost? It's not Kevin.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
Kevin?

04:12.080 --> 04:13.491
Oh!

04:16.800 --> 04:18.404
"We commit her body to the ground."

04:18.560 --> 04:21.962
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust."

04:22.120 --> 04:23.849
"With the clear
and certain hope of resurrection

04:24.000 --> 04:25.729
and to the eternal life,

04:25.880 --> 04:27.166
according to the mighty working,

04:27.320 --> 04:30.483
whereby he is able
to subdue all things unto himself."

04:30.640 --> 04:36.010
In nominee de Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritu Sanctum

04:42.840 --> 04:45.571
- What are you doing here?
- Please, she was my friend!

04:45.760 --> 04:48.001
The dead human or the angel
that was killed while possessing her?

04:48.160 --> 04:50.162
The angel.
Rebecca?

04:50.320 --> 04:54.325
Rebecca had a lot of friends.
Friends like Metatron.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.842
- Where is he?
- You're looking in the wrong place.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.241
Rebecca and Metatron were friends.

05:00.440 --> 05:04.161
That was a long time ago.
Had no contact since the Fall.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.723
Naomi, Metatron,
heavenly battles, politics.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.167
She gave it up.
All of it.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.365
Rebecca taught us the angels
have lost touch with our mission.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.931
What do you mean by "us"?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.731
The Penitents.
Her followers?

05:23.360 --> 05:26.523
- Another faction.
- Not like the others.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.563
We don't make war.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.922
We live humbly among these humans.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.885
Or we did.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.964
He killed all the others.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.405
Then he killed her.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.564
- Who did?
- Who else?

05:44.760 --> 05:47.730
The monster.
Bartholomew.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.766
- Anything?
- Couple of dings.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.328
A little EMF activity,
but mostly silence.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.323
So, he's back in the Veil.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.006
I guess so.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.003
Fumbling to break through.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.242
I mean, you got to figure,
it took Bobby months to make contact.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.402
Kevin's only...

06:13.600 --> 06:14.840
He's new at this.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.206
Right.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.129
All right, you're up.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.445
Kevin?

06:45.480 --> 06:46.891
Kevin?

06:53.400 --> 06:55.209
All right, I can't do this.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.330
Coffee-buzzing,
bump-in-the-night crap.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.291
I got serious things to say to you.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.960
Okay, and I'm not
gonna say them to this.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.489
Kevin, I'm sorry.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.641
You did not choose this life.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.245
You busted your ass.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.290
You lost everything.
Everyone you loved.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.444
And your reward?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.684
Getting killed.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.009
On my watch.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.891
If I'd...

07:48.360 --> 07:50.089
It was on me.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.570
It was my fault. I didn't...

07:54.720 --> 07:56.210
And there's nothing I can do
to make that right.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.249
I'm so sorry.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.203
Hey, you see that?
The lights were...

08:08.600 --> 08:10.568
This is not happening.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.808
I did not spend months
struggling to break through the Veil,

08:12.960 --> 08:14.769
just to get stuck
listening to Dean Winchester

08:14.920 --> 08:17.366
having a self-pity session.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.204
I didn't hear enough of those
when I was alive.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.566
Kevin?

08:23.280 --> 08:24.361
You can see me?

08:29.120 --> 08:30.406
All right, take it easy, Kevin.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.562
You might not hold this form
for too long. It takes a while.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.530
- We should talk fast.
- Wait. Why aren't you in Heaven?

08:35.679 --> 08:37.961
I mean, if anybody deserves
an express pass to paradise...

08:38.039 --> 08:40.725
I couldn't.
I can't.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.405
No one can.
Heaven's closed for business.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.847
Everyone who's died
since the angels fell?

08:46.040 --> 08:48.930
We're just stuck inside the Veil.
Waiting.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.323
And it's bad in here.
Like, DMV-line-times-infinity bad.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.086
- I mean, what can we do?
- I need a favor. A big one.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.730
Okay.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.091
Find my mother.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.884
Kevin.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.929
Crowley only told you she was alive
to mess with you.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.129
I'm not going off his word.
All right, I have my own sources.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.170
It's crowded in the Veil.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.931
All of us are stuck
near the sites of our deaths.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.890
But I've been able to pass messages,
spirit-to-spirit.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.281
I made contact
with another new arrival.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.444
She says she saw my mom
just a week ago, alive.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.366
Okay, this spirit that you're playing
ghost telephone with,

09:28.520 --> 09:29.681
I mean,
what do you even know about her?

09:29.880 --> 09:32.963
Her name's Candy.
Says she's in a forest in Wichita.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.121
"Candy?"

09:34.280 --> 09:36.726
That's it?
That's all you got?

09:36.880 --> 09:40.771
Long-distance communication
within the Veil, it's not ideal.

09:40.920 --> 09:45.005
That's why I need you to go there.
Summon her, see what else she knows.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.121
You say you want to make it right?
This is how.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.804
Where did your friend go
in such a hurry?

10:01.960 --> 10:04.406
You're too late.
He's gone.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.808
Castiel?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.651
Our boss has been looking for you.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.849
All right, that's the trestle.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.526
Candy said her spirit
was stuck nearby.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.444
- She died here?
- Yeah.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.161
Dude, what got her?
A bear?

10:33.360 --> 10:37.081
I'm stuck on the fact we're trying
to summon a ghost named Candy.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.284
Just because Kevin said he heard
his mom is alive, doesn't mean she...

10:40.440 --> 10:43.523
Hey, we owe it to the kid to try,
right?

10:46.200 --> 10:49.682
- What did you bring?
- Well, she's only been dead a week.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.286
So, I figured she could use
as much help as she can get.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.124
So...

10:56.120 --> 10:59.203
- Really?
- Whatever works.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.921
- How much longer?
- You have some place to be?

11:23.920 --> 11:25.285
His blade?

11:28.880 --> 11:33.169
Standard security protocol.
Can't be too careful these days.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.767
Hello, Bartholomew.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.245
Castiel.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.767
It has been too long.

11:51.640 --> 11:56.009
You feel that?
I think I felt a chill.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.567
Yeah.
That's because it's cold.

12:04.480 --> 12:09.930
Crowley, it's Dean.
Call me when you get this.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.487
- Really, Dean?
- What?

12:12.640 --> 12:14.529
That's your third
unanswered voice-mail.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.286
You ever think,
maybe he's just not that into you?

12:17.440 --> 12:21.764
Well, he is our last confirmed link
to Miss Tran.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.922
Yes, he is a flaming douche.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.320
But at least we know he's real,

12:25.480 --> 12:28.882
which is more than we can say
for this Candy no-show.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.886
Candy?

12:44.040 --> 12:46.566
Are you there?
Is that you, Candy?

12:46.720 --> 12:48.802
Hello.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.246
Hello?

12:52.320 --> 12:54.561
Madness, wasn't it?

12:54.720 --> 12:57.451
A puny force of 20
behind enemy lines,

12:57.600 --> 13:01.241
launching an incursion
against Raphael and his loyalists?

13:01.400 --> 13:05.724
- It was a calculated risk.
- I thought you'd gone insane.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.050
I questioned your leadership,

13:08.200 --> 13:11.124
second-guessed
every step of the campaign.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.044
But you were my commander.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.727
I held my tongue.
I followed orders.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.164
Raphael fled.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.806
Most of his loyalists
dead or captured.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.691
Your gambit paid off.
You won.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.447
- We won.
- Word of your victory spread.

13:30.440 --> 13:36.004
You got called back to the garrison.
You became the great Castiel.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.361
While I stayed behind just a grunt.

13:39.520 --> 13:44.447
You gained a reputation for yourself
as well.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.602
The captives I left in your care.

13:48.040 --> 13:52.011
You tortured and killed them.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.888
I was ordered to kill those captives.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.044
You've been flying solo for so long,

13:59.200 --> 14:01.362
you've forgotten
that's what angels do.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.568
We follow orders.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.004
Not you, though.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.049
Not anymore.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.643
That's right.
I give them.

14:24.600 --> 14:29.242
- There, stop, stop, stop. Candy?
- In the box. They put me in the box.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.644
All of us, in boxes, side-by-side.
Me, Jerome, Linda.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.326
- Linda's...
- Miss Tran.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.649
- Candy, these boxes, where were they?
- I don't know.

14:41.040 --> 14:45.329
It was cold.
Dark.

14:45.480 --> 14:50.042
There was a vent.
We could talk to one another.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.244
Okay, the walls?
Can you describe them?

14:53.400 --> 14:57.166
Bare. Cement.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.529
Except for the door.
That was metal.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.206
But like, ridged?

15:03.360 --> 15:04.361
Ridged?

15:04.520 --> 15:06.045
- You mean, like, corrugated?
- Yeah!

15:06.200 --> 15:09.363
I tried to lift the door,
but I couldn't.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.602
Locked from the outside.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.167
- Like a storage unit?
- Maybe.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.766
Candy, who was holding you there?

15:17.120 --> 15:18.565
Two men.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.411
It was so dark in the box.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.847
When they came I could barely see.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.844
The first guy was British, I think?

15:29.000 --> 15:32.129
Kind of short.
Loved hearing himself talk?

15:32.320 --> 15:34.891
Crowley. And what did they want?

15:35.040 --> 15:38.761
He said I was worth more alive
than dead.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.002
But he stopped coming.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.209
Then it was just the other guy.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.484
We thought with just him...

15:50.520 --> 15:52.682
...we tried to escape.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.487
I ran so hard, so far.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.324
But...

16:04.680 --> 16:07.365
Candy?

16:25.440 --> 16:27.966
Candy, you there?

16:28.120 --> 16:31.203
What about Miss Tran?
Candy?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.202
[don't know.
Maybe she survived.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.364
"Maybe?"
That's not what you told her son.

16:37.520 --> 16:42.082
I said she "was" alive.
I don't know what happened after.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.447
For her sake...

16:44.600 --> 16:46.489
...I hope she's dead.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.281
No, no, no.

17:07.440 --> 17:11.126
No! No!

17:18.359 --> 17:20.407
Okay, there are three
storage facilities nearby.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.809
The closest one
is about a mile up the road.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.442
Oh, and I dug up some stuff on Candy.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.922
Turns out, she was the kept-woman
of a powerful congressman.

17:31.080 --> 17:35.563
Gossip blog said he worshipped
the ground she walked on, literally.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.846
He had a foot fetish.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.164
So, Crowley was holding the beloved
tootsies of a powerful politician?

17:41.320 --> 17:43.846
And the beloved mother
of a powerful prophet.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.128
Human leverage.
Then, why kill Candy?

17:50.440 --> 17:52.647
You heard her.
She tried to make a break for it.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.207
Maybe Crowley wanted
to make an example.

17:55.360 --> 18:00.491
No. No, the guy he left in charge.
Crowley wanted the victims alive.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.323
So, what?
You wanna give him a medal?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.761
Crowley's the one who put them
in the cells in the first place.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.570
Yeah, I know.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.041
I'm just talking it out.
You know, working the case.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.521
Business-like.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.086
Realizing they were more trouble
than they were worth,

18:20.280 --> 18:22.408
we purged our human allies.

18:22.560 --> 18:27.168
Then commandeered Boyle
Ministries Inc. for our own use.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.767
Buddy Boyle?
So, you killed him.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.203
No, we made him
and his colleagues vessels.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.330
At least those who didn't go pop.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.685
You nervous, Castiel?

18:44.840 --> 18:47.923
Your followers want me dead.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.684
I'm not entirely certain
you don't, too.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.765
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.603
- So we're friends here?
- Yes.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.162
- And I'm free to go.
- Of course.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.721
Though I don't know why you would.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.451
What's out there for you, Castiel?

19:06.600 --> 19:10.730
What do you really expect
to accomplish on your own?

19:10.880 --> 19:14.680
- You'll never find Metatron that way.
- How did you know about Metatron?

19:14.880 --> 19:17.167
I figured that's why
you were pursuing Rebecca,

19:17.320 --> 19:18.890
engaging with her follower.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.123
We have different methods, Cass,
but we want the same thing.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.728
To find Metatron
and restore our kind to Heaven.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.451
Then why kill Rebecca
and her followers?

19:29.640 --> 19:31.608
- They were no threat to you.
- Perhaps.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.808
But better to nip
a fledgling faction in the bud,

19:33.960 --> 19:36.440
than let it grow into a bigger threat
down the road.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.887
A drop of blood to save a gallon.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.611
- I don't agree.
- I'm not asking you to.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.286
I will outrace Malachi
in the hunt for Metatron.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.842
And I will certainly outrace you
on your own.

19:49.040 --> 19:52.806
But if you can set aside your qualms
about methods for one second,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.241
there's no reason the two of us
can't take him down.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.411
Together.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.080
Let me guess.
5'5", pasty-white.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.811
Black-rimmed hipster glasses
just like the last place.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.242
Nailed it.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.240
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, hi. Agents Nicks and McVie.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.284
Need to take a look
at your rental records.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.445
Uh... my manager's not here.
I really don't think I should...

20:24.600 --> 20:28.446
- Hey! The records, pal.
- Yeah.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.809
Barry!
Bring out the rental binder!

20:43.440 --> 20:45.204
There you go, sir.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.887
Hey.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.644
Okay, check it out.
Corridor Q.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.963
Three adjacent units
separate from the others.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.482
I mean, Candy said
there were three hostages, right?

21:18.480 --> 21:21.165
Okay, it's all leased
by the same guy.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.527
A "D. Webster."

21:23.680 --> 21:26.411
"D. Webster?"
Wait, as in, like, Daniel Webster?

21:27.960 --> 21:30.406
Well, I know a lame, Crowley in-joke
when I see one.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.728
You guys say, "D. Webster?"

21:33.880 --> 21:37.805
Yeah.
Yeah, you seen him?

21:37.960 --> 21:41.851
No, just I know his name
from the records.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.731
He's leasing another unit
on the other side of the facility.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.045
I could show you.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.447
Yeah, that'd be great.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.524
All right,
why don't you take Corridor Q.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.286
I'll go with Del,
the Funky Homo Sapien.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.241
Hm.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.605
Miss Tran! Miss Tran.
Hey, hey, hey. It's me.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.564
- It's Sam. It's Sam.
- Sam?

22:51.760 --> 22:54.240
- Oh, my gosh.
- Sam!

22:56.280 --> 22:59.409
We have to get out of here,
before he comes back.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.921
Is Kevin with you?

23:34.920 --> 23:37.002
You sure this is the one
leased by Webster?

23:37.160 --> 23:38.969
Yeah, this is it.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.723
This isn't Crowley's unit.

24:10.280 --> 24:13.568
- What are these locations?
- Sightings of Metatron.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.482
- He's been on Earth?
- Three times we know of so far.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.923
That's the benefit
of a massive ground operation.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.084
Eyes and ears everywhere.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.925
It's only a matter of time
before we get an active location.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.366
Why wait?

24:30.520 --> 24:33.251
With this kind of information,
I'd lure him out.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.923
I knew you'd be an asset.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.408
No one's as motivated as you
to take him down.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.528
I've had my hands so full
with the factions,

24:42.680 --> 24:44.523
it's distracted me
from the real goal.

24:44.680 --> 24:48.127
But with you by my side,

24:48.280 --> 24:51.045
the new boss and the ultimate rebel
working together?

24:51.200 --> 24:54.727
Think of the message that would send
to would-be dissidents.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.247
They'd finally understand
that resistance is futile.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.011
Think of the bloodshed
we could avert.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.644
What a united angelkind
could accomplish in Heaven.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.290
Elsewhere.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.601
- Bart, what are you doing?
- What needs to be done.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.481
I'm gonna torture the rebel,
find out what he knows,

25:23.640 --> 25:25.290
then kill him.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.443
And you're going to help.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.287
There we go.
All right.

25:42.480 --> 25:46.405
There's an electrical line,
leads to the control panel.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.683
Okay, this might take a while.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.445
We have to unplug
the ground wire first.

26:06.600 --> 26:10.321
If this is standard US color coding,
it should be the green one.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.681
Okay.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.644
Helping Kevin with his Engineering
Club assignments,

26:14.840 --> 26:16.808
I picked up a thing or two.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.604
I'm sure he insisted,

26:19.800 --> 26:24.283
but I trust you weren't foolish
to bring Kevin along on this mission.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.523
That you left him someplace safe?

26:28.640 --> 26:30.642
- Of course.
- Good.

26:30.800 --> 26:34.600
Now, all we have to do
is get this door open,

26:34.760 --> 26:36.922
get the hell out of here.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.526
And you will bring me to my son.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.683
Listen.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.884
Miss Tran.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.001
You will take me to my son.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.005
Flashlight.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.045
Flashlight!

27:24.600 --> 27:26.682
"Trust me", he says.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.366
"You definitely
want to be a part of this.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.364
A chance to get in
on the ground floor of my operation.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.603
A real learning experience.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.969
Consider it a stepping stone,
my lad.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.851
Like an internship!"

27:42.000 --> 27:45.891
I should've known.
Internships suck!

27:49.720 --> 27:52.041
So, you're the one.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.043
You're the one
Crowley left in charge.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.170
Yeah.
What a privilege.

27:57.360 --> 28:02.491
Feeding the apes, hosing the floors,
washing out the honey-buckets.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.927
And for zero credit!

28:06.240 --> 28:08.811
The boss?
MIA.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.249
Too important to show for work.
To even return my calls.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.324
And you know the worst part?

28:18.480 --> 28:22.041
I wasn't even allowed to kill anyone.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.562
I was told to protect them.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.207
I mean, how sick is that?

28:29.360 --> 28:33.251
Am I not a young, vital demon,

28:33.440 --> 28:36.250
with basic demon needs and rights?

28:40.320 --> 28:42.971
And when I call Crowley
to inform him

28:43.280 --> 28:47.001
that I've single-handedly
caught the Winchesters,

28:47.120 --> 28:50.761
if he even answers my call,

28:50.920 --> 28:52.922
think I'll get a "Thank you"?

28:53.120 --> 28:54.770
Ha!

28:57.160 --> 29:00.130
Yeah, you're right, kid.
He won't give you credit.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.331
If anything, he'll be pissed.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.361
What?

29:06.520 --> 29:10.002
Well, me and Crowley,
we're tight now.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.527
Thick as thieves.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.968
Saw him just last month.
We, uh, had a grand old time.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.970
So, that's where he's been.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.408
Out partying with humans.
With Hunters?

29:29.360 --> 29:31.328
While I languish here,

29:31.480 --> 29:36.566
in this go-nowhere,
no-kill joke of a job!

29:36.720 --> 29:40.406
"Partying" is a bit
of an exaggeration.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.847
This job blows!

29:49.760 --> 29:51.364
I quit.

29:54.320 --> 29:59.042
- Tell me where they are.
- I told you. They're dead.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.565
I'm the last.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.200
Can't you see he's telling the truth?
He's done!

30:05.000 --> 30:07.002
Yes, I believe he is.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.128
Now finish him off.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.725
Bartholomew,
it doesn't need to be like this.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.645
Castiel,
get your head out of the sand.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.361
Do you know why they brought you
back from the battlefield?

30:22.520 --> 30:24.329
- The truth?
- Yes, I know the truth.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.450
Our leaders
wanted those captives killed.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.807
And they knew you'd stand
in the way of their order.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.122
Said you didn't have it in you.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.170
That you couldn't do
what needed to be done.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.601
But I know different.
I know you've changed.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.491
- I'm not a murderer.
- You weren't. Not then.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.604
But since then, you've slaughtered
thousands of angels.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.240
You killed Malachi's man
for his grace!

30:50.400 --> 30:54.166
Who I was, what I did.
That's not who I am!

30:54.320 --> 30:57.244
No?
Then, who are you?

30:58.760 --> 31:01.889
I wanna work with you, Castiel.
But I need proof.

31:02.040 --> 31:05.089
They need proof that they were wrong.

31:06.360 --> 31:09.250
That you can do what has to be done.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.649
This has to be done.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.281
I was never free to leave.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.847
My only choice
was to obey or be killed.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.083
Well, I choose.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.169
I am truly sorry to hear that.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.446
No!

31:43.440 --> 31:47.126
Do you know how long it's been
since I've done this?

31:51.440 --> 31:53.090
I thank you

31:53.240 --> 31:55.481
for reminding me what I truly am.

32:07.800 --> 32:11.327
As your refusal
makes perfectly clear,

32:11.480 --> 32:14.165
you've always thought
you were better than me.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.242
Shall we put your superiority
to the test?

32:22.520 --> 32:23.931
Once and for all?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.240
No.

32:31.840 --> 32:35.322
Angels fighting angels
has to stop somewhere.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.687
Might as well stop with me.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.161
Fine.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.929
Stand down!

32:47.080 --> 32:48.844
This is between me and the rebel.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.689
To the victor.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.362
Do it.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.049
No.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.526
What are you now?
A penitent?

33:14.720 --> 33:17.200
I'm nothing.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.647
You never did understand, Castiel.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.247
There can be no peace
without bloodshed.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.929
Let me pass.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.969
Do it.
Kill me.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.771
No, we're saving you
for someone else.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.684
Crowley.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.770
Much worse.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.491
Do the honors, Miss Tran.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.570
With pleasure.

34:25.719 --> 34:29.281
Hey, lady, I swear.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.560
I was just following ord...

34:40.159 --> 34:42.844
Take me to my son.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.602
Kevin?
You here?

35:02.200 --> 35:03.531
Kev!

35:05.160 --> 35:06.525
Well?

35:11.480 --> 35:13.562
We got her.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.961
She's alive.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.884
She's here.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.805
But we wanted
to give you a moment to...

35:20.960 --> 35:22.200
You know, process.

35:23.880 --> 35:27.202
No. I...

35:29.280 --> 35:31.362
Does she know?

35:31.560 --> 35:33.642
Kevin?

35:43.400 --> 35:45.607
Hello, son.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.245
Hey, Mom.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.605
So, this is, uh...
This is all of it.

35:59.800 --> 36:04.567
You know, Hunter's tools.
Notebooks, papers, pencils.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.410
PSAT results.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.648
Perfect score.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.885
Way to go, kid.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.283
This.
This is it.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.449
It's his father's.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.091
Mr. Tran died
when Kevin was a baby.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.965
It's the only piece of his father
Kevin ever had.

36:27.800 --> 36:33.091
If Kevin's spirit
is bound to some object here...

36:34.600 --> 36:36.443
...'this is it.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.965
Listen, Miss Tran.

36:42.120 --> 36:46.011
There's a lot that we don't know
about this Heaven situation.

36:46.160 --> 36:50.006
There are risks
to taking Kevin home with you.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.810
Now, spirits,
the longer that they're in the Veil,

36:51.960 --> 36:53.644
they have a way of...

36:55.600 --> 36:57.762
Well, it doesn't end up well.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.327
He's my son.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.643
It's my job to keep him safe

37:04.800 --> 37:07.485
for as long as I can.

37:14.160 --> 37:18.210
Sorry I created this chaos.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.360
Sorry I couldn't do more to fix it.

37:25.240 --> 37:29.040
You may have lost the war, Rebecca,

37:29.200 --> 37:30.850
but you tried a new way.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.287
You have my respect for that.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.682
I don't wanna fight.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.561
- But if I have to, I will.
- I didn't come to fight.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.047
When I fell,
I thought I had no choice.

37:48.240 --> 37:51.847
But yesterday, you showed me
that there is a choice.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.206
And I choose you.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.682
I'm sorry.
I'm no leader.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.207
Yes, you are.

38:01.360 --> 38:04.204
If you will have me, Castiel,
I will follow you.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.167
And I am not the only one.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.004
She was held and tortured for a year
because of me.

38:18.120 --> 38:22.205
Now that I've found her,
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.891
She's my responsibility.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.561
And you were ours.
And we failed you.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.724
Sam, I know that wasn't you.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.324
Go put a blade in that asshat
who possessed you,

38:36.480 --> 38:38.289
we'll call it square.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.924
Guys.
Thank you.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.771
You can thank us
when we get you to Heaven,

38:48.920 --> 38:50.763
where you belong.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.800
Okay, until then,
enjoy your time with your mom.

38:53.720 --> 38:59.443
The, uninterrupted, 24/7,
no-escape, quality time.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.443
Dick.

39:04.600 --> 39:09.049
Hey, before I go.
Will you guys promise me something?

39:10.320 --> 39:11.845
Yeah, anything.

39:12.080 --> 39:16.449
Can you two get over it?

39:18.920 --> 39:22.925
Just because you couldn't see me
doesn't mean I couldn't see you.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.401
The drama, the fighting?

39:26.680 --> 39:28.091
It's stupid.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.648
My mom's taking home a ghost.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.441
You two, you're both still here.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.971
Of course. Promise.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.084
- Yeah.
- Good.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.809
Well, that was...

40:19.000 --> 40:20.684
Yeah, okay.
