Cinderblock has escaped
from Jump City prison.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.449
He's sure to terrorize the city
at any moment.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.152
Until the terrorizing begins,
Robin,

00:51.185 --> 00:53.321
we will do the
birth celebrating!

00:53.354 --> 00:55.356
But none of you were born
on this date.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.159
It's the birthday
of our friendship, bro.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.593
Friendships
don't have birthdays.

00:59.627 --> 01:00.728
Uh, yeah, they do.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.597
And the day our friendship
was born was pretty sweet.

01:03.631 --> 01:07.301
- Right, Beasty?
- Bestest day of my life, bro.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.511
You.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.680
I didn't like you before.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.751
- But I do now.
- I likes you, too.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.419
Awesome! Let's play volleyball.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.855
Only if we can play
with our shirts off.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.757
Way ahead of you. Bulls-eye!

01:34.595 --> 01:35.629
Whoo!

01:38.199 --> 01:40.668
And we's been best bro's
ever since.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.403
Fine, you're friends.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.272
That doesn't mean you get
to have a birthday party.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.706
Only living things
can have birthdays,

01:45.739 --> 01:48.209
and friendship
is not a living thing.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.211
Than what do you call this?

01:51.312 --> 01:52.380
Ah-ooh, ha-ha,

01:52.413 --> 01:54.148
where did that thing come from?

01:54.182 --> 01:55.283
Wasn't you listening?

01:55.316 --> 01:56.550
It's our friendship, yo.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.619
And it was born on
shirtless volleyball day.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.788
But friendships
aren't literally born.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.156
Literally, they are.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.257
Observe.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.459
Hear the friendship, friends!

02:12.633 --> 02:16.204
If one of these creatures is born
when a friendship is formed, then

02:16.237 --> 02:17.538
why have I
never seen one before?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.273
Well, I think that'd be
just the question

02:19.307 --> 02:21.409
you gotsa ask yourself, bro.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.311
All right, y'all,

What up, Rave?

02:39.227 --> 02:40.494
Robin, my man.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.497
- Hello.
- Hi.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.832
Nice weather we're havin'.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.567
Enjoy it while it lasts.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.769
- Cold front's movin' in.
- Oh, that's good to know.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.904
Might be time to invest
in a warm coat.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.243
What's wrong with you guys?

02:55.276 --> 02:56.610
You are not telling of the jokes

02:56.644 --> 02:58.879
or doing of
the spontaneous dancings.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.514
Why would we do that?

03:00.548 --> 03:01.915
Yeah, it ain't like
we's best friends, yo.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.851
Actually, you are.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.587
Our friendship!

03:06.620 --> 03:07.988
It's probably running
around here somewhere.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.490
I'll search the tower.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.992
I can't find it.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.396
He must've run'd away when
we was going hard on that cake.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.299
Yes, yes, that's what
must have happened.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.534
Hey there, little guy,

03:20.568 --> 03:22.370
you wanna be pals?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.346
This is bad! Real bad!

03:32.380 --> 03:35.583
Perhaps if you engage in your
usual telling of the jokes,

03:35.616 --> 03:36.984
you will find that
your friendship

03:37.017 --> 03:38.686
is as strong as ever.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.488
Uh, knock, knock.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.922
- Who's there?
- Me.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.457
- Me who?
- Beast Boy.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.559
- Hi, I'm Cyborg.
- Thank you for your time.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.029
Our friendship
is really gone, yo.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.398
We need to fix this.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.832
Cinderblock is on the loose.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.468
And having you two act like
awkward acquaintances

03:54.502 --> 03:55.803
will be a liability
on the battlefield.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.971
Wait, if new friendships
are born every day,

03:58.005 --> 04:01.475
maybe all we have to do is recreate
scenarios from your shared past.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.411
And a new friendship
will be born!

04:03.444 --> 04:06.747
This idea
is the genius of the lamp.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.781
Titans, go!

04:07.815 --> 04:10.384
Recreate Cyborg
and Beast Boy's friendship.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.224
Okay, Titans,

04:17.257 --> 04:20.428
we are going to re-enact Cyborg
and Beast Boy's first meeting.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.897
Wait, Star... Who are you
supposed to be?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.065
I am the goose.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.000
Attack

04:27.034 --> 04:30.338
the goose!

04:34.608 --> 04:36.377
Who wants to play
some volleyball?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.545
Oh, yeah!

04:37.578 --> 04:39.413
Let's get those shirts off.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.916
Na-uh, I ain't taking
my shirt off for this dude.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.352
Me neither.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.853
Why not?

04:45.886 --> 04:48.456
He's unsafe, he's dangerous,
and he's unsafe!

04:48.489 --> 04:51.425
That's right, I am, fool.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.063
One of the cornerstones
of Cyborg

04:56.096 --> 04:57.698
and Beast Boy's relationship

04:57.731 --> 04:58.799
is food.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.534
They are sure to do
the befriending

05:00.568 --> 05:03.103
while consuming of
their favorite digestibles.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.441
Uh, somethin' smells good, yo.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.643
Sure does.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.078
What is all this?

05:11.111 --> 05:13.581
Oh, we just whipped up
some of your favorite foods.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.115
Oh, snap, you did!

05:15.148 --> 05:19.920
Tofu lasagna, tofu hot dogs,
tofu milkshake.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.123
Wow! It's like
a veggie heaven, yo.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.092
Uh, dig in, bro.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.660
Tofu? Yuck!

05:26.694 --> 05:28.929
I'm about to get down
on this baby burger.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.566
Ew, you eats meat?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.502
Nothing but. Check it!

05:36.637 --> 05:39.373
Meatball party!

05:39.407 --> 05:40.908
Who wants meatballs?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.711
Ahh!

05:43.744 --> 05:45.946
You are a monster.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.751
Our efforts seem to
have made friends

05:50.784 --> 05:52.986
Beast Boy and Cyborg
care for one another

05:53.020 --> 05:53.954
even the less.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.023
The only thing left
to get them to bond over

05:56.056 --> 05:57.057
is music.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.526

07:20.941 --> 07:23.511
You found Cinderblock?

07:23.544 --> 07:25.178
No, man, we found snacks.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.547
Mmm, Mmm. ah...

07:26.580 --> 07:28.649
Oh, man,
you gotta try these, yo.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.819
Oh yeah, yo.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.186
- Then I know somebody...
- What!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.160
Forget the snacks.
Titans, go!

07:44.965 --> 07:47.234
Ah, wait a minute...

07:50.103 --> 07:52.205
- Ah, this set, bro.
- Yeah, hold it there.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.708
- Hold up, after this one bite.
- Hold up, I didn't try to eat...

08:05.085 --> 08:06.987

08:07.020 --> 08:09.089
Oh, man,
you gotta try these, yo.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.625
Just get over here
and move this rubble.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.226
Aw, man, that's too much work.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.829
And I's super tired
from all these activities.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.865

- I gives up.

08:17.898 --> 08:21.101

feel right now though?

08:21.134 --> 08:24.738
Ah, so good.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.640
Wait, so you're just
gonna sit there?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.842
Cinderblock is getting away.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.744

08:53.233 --> 08:55.268
You know I do.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.746
- Pizza!
- My dude!

09:07.080 --> 09:09.082
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.585
I guess you can't force people
to be friends.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.920
Indeed.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.054
The friendship
must occur on it's own

09:14.087 --> 09:15.656
like the natural gases.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.659
And you know we's got them
natural gases, yo.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.865

09:24.898 --> 09:26.266

09:26.299 --> 09:29.703

is back at full strength,

09:29.737 --> 09:31.238

to have been here

09:31.271 --> 09:33.373

09:33.406 --> 09:36.710
