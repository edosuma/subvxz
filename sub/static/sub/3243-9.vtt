00:00.001 --> 00:04.370
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.372 --> 00:06.138
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.140 --> 00:09.375
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.377 --> 00:12.578
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.580 --> 00:15.514
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:17.316
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.318 --> 00:20.552
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:20.554 --> 00:23.622
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:28.396 --> 00:30.295
 <i> Previously on</i> the messengers:

00:30.297 --> 00:33.499
  We need to find and stop the
four horsemen of the apocalypse.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.667
     <i> If those four horsemen</i>
   <i> succeed in breaking their</i>

00:35.669 --> 00:38.303
       Seals, we can all
    kiss humanity good-bye.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.638
     Open your eyes, peter.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.407
You, erin
and all the others--

00:41.409 --> 00:43.609
You've got to follow the signs.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.145
    Just like the messengers
          before you.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.615
Leland, stop.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.785
Nero health murdered my mother.

00:52.787 --> 00:55.120
     Leland, don't do this.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.725
   Reporter: The police have
 positively i.D.'d the suspect

00:59.727 --> 01:02.694
      As leland schiller,
the alleged criminal mastermind

01:02.696 --> 01:04.830
      Behind the anarchist
     hacker group abbadon.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.698
How is that possible? I mean,
if we stopped leland schiller,

01:06.700 --> 01:08.700
    Then...
                   I don't know.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.402
     But the second seal's
          been broken.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.204
        Why is he here?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.405
       He broke his seal.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.706
You're obsolete.

01:14.708 --> 01:18.510
                  You dare think
               you can cross me?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.345
          (distorted):
            I am...

01:20.347 --> 01:23.148
           Your god!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.323
   (dog barking in distance)

01:34.695 --> 01:36.762
        (woman screams)

01:39.100 --> 01:41.166
    (woman whimpering on tv)

01:48.175 --> 01:49.741
         (door closes)
                     peter: Hey.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.644
  Oh, god. Oh, you scared me.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.213
              Sorry. We're home.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.481
        I can see that.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.882
     Where's everyone else?
                        Joshua's

01:56.884 --> 01:58.450
   Getting rose from the airport
         and everyone else

01:58.452 --> 02:01.120
             Is getting takeout
           from the last supper.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.455
Please tell me it's...
            Chicken fried steak.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.791
           How's amy?
Tucked her in a while ago,

02:05.793 --> 02:07.793
      But she was kind of
    in a weird mood tonight.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.328
       What do you mean?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.630
  She was just kind of quiet.
    I think she missed you.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.699
       I missed her, too.
     I'll go check on her.

02:18.806 --> 02:22.274
 So, we're going to california
   to find the next horseman.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.342
Do you know who it is?

02:23.344 --> 02:25.577
      Not sure, but joshua
          had a vision

02:25.579 --> 02:27.446
      Of these brothers--
       couple of farmers.

02:27.448 --> 02:30.482
   Next horseman is a farmer?

02:30.484 --> 02:33.652
           (groaning)

02:33.654 --> 02:36.555
   Would you prefer a zombie?

02:36.557 --> 02:39.224
      (groaning, crashing)

02:51.772 --> 02:54.339
I love you, amy.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.739
           Bartender:
     <i> Last call for alcohol.</i>

03:27.741 --> 03:29.841
   (indistinct conversations)
i just don't understand how

03:29.843 --> 03:32.778
       Amy could've known
         about michael.
Did you or anybody else

03:32.780 --> 03:34.780
Ever tell her about your son?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.582
  No. That's what's so weird.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.218
                   She must have
            overheard something.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.986
Or it's destiny.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.488
Look, she's
the daughter of a messenger.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.591
Each of her drawings
could be another sign from god.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.760
Who knows. Maybe she can
even help you find michael.

03:48.762 --> 03:49.895
           I hope so.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.263
Got the grub.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.630
You guys ready to roll?
         (phone rings)

03:52.633 --> 03:54.733
                 Yeah.
    Hang on a sec.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.834
               It's rose.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.269
                     Hey. You at
                    the airport?

03:57.271 --> 03:58.804
         Joshua, help.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.507
 Leland's here, he's after me.
        What do you mean leland?

04:02.509 --> 04:04.876
                  What happened?
      He found me, i don't
      know how. I ran away

04:04.878 --> 04:07.679
   And he chased me. I can't
 see him. Please-please hurry.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.880
                  Where are you?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.983
     Grey forest cemetery.
      Oh, god, i see him.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.585
       He's coming back.
        Joshua, help me.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.854
         Look, we're on our way.
           Let's go.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.257
                     Rose.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.558
               What the hell
               is happening?

04:34.742 --> 04:37.776
        We need to talk.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.552
    You're not welcome here.

04:47.554 --> 04:51.456
Leave this place.
  Aw. Is that any way to treat

04:51.458 --> 04:53.358
A guest, joshua?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.397
             Raul:
 Come on. This isn't the place.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.564
      We're walking away.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.500
                   Walking away.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.311
         What the hell?

05:12.313 --> 05:14.913
That's one way to describe it.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.657
Nice trick, don't you think?

05:25.659 --> 05:29.394
       Requires a bit of focus,
       but it's very effective.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.664
             Let us out of here.
   No. No one's going anywhere.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.850
I put all
the staff to sleep

05:34.851 --> 05:37.035
 In the back room and we're all
 gonna have a nice little chat.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.503
         How about no?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.339
           How about if anyone
          tries to leave again,

05:40.341 --> 05:41.406
                 You're dead?

05:41.408 --> 05:42.574
           Don't listen to him--

05:42.576 --> 05:44.343
                        He can't
                        kill us.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.011
            Not by his own hand.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.547
          God wouldn't allow it.
      You want to try me?

05:49.583 --> 05:52.351
      Walk out that door.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.353
        See if god still
       loves what's left.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.360
We can't just
leave her out there.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.495
          Don't worry, we won't.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.932
     Look, why don't you just
 tell us what the hell you want?

06:06.934 --> 06:09.401
I want joshua to tell me exactly
what he saw in his last vision.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.136
     You got to be kidding.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.504
 Did you see the next horseman?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.773
    You show me where my son is.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.675
        Then maybe we'll
   tell you about the vision.
Ooh.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.910
     You want to negotiate.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.947
             Fine.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.049
Then let's make a deal.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.884
                       I'm gonna
                    tell you all

06:25.886 --> 06:28.120
        A little story,

06:28.122 --> 06:31.656
         And in return
 for your undivided attention,

06:31.658 --> 06:33.392
I'll tell you where michael is.

06:36.597 --> 06:40.165
      I'll clear your name
         with the feds.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.169
       I'll get you back
      every dime you lost.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.140
         And, joshua...
Save your breath.

06:48.142 --> 06:51.510
         I would never
     make a deal with you.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.145
          Fair enough.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.980
But when all is said and done...

06:54.982 --> 06:57.516
            I bet you'll give me

06:57.518 --> 06:59.484
             Everything i want.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.720
           <i> (growling)</i>

07:01.722 --> 07:03.789
       (woman whimpering)

07:06.160 --> 07:09.127
            (growls)
           (screams)

07:09.129 --> 07:11.163
          (crunching)

07:11.165 --> 07:13.465
      For real?
                      What?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.467
               I get nightmares.
     (chuckles)

07:15.469 --> 07:17.502
            (thump)

07:18.906 --> 07:20.806
              Did you hear that?

07:20.808 --> 07:23.074
     Yeah, it's the undead.
    They're coming for you.
                      Not funny.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.509
               I heard something
              at the front door.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.948
 Man: Oh, my god, are you bit?
      Woman: No, i'm not.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.950
          Okay, fine.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.618
            If it makes you feel
                any better, i'll

07:33.620 --> 07:35.454
           Go check.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.122
        But you're gonna
   feel like a complete tool

07:37.124 --> 07:38.657
  As soon as i open this door.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.725
(gasps)
oh, my god!

07:40.727 --> 07:42.561
       Hey, are you okay?
         What happened?

07:42.563 --> 07:44.129
Who are you?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.730
           Excuse me.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.199
        It's you again.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.134
             She's the one i saw
                 at the library.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.203
       And you talked to joshua,
    right? At the grocery store.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.171
       You're the one who
    used to be a messenger?

07:53.173 --> 07:56.942
Yes. My name
is eliza shepard.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.144
And i'm here
because i'm worried.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.717
  I'm sorry, am i keeping you
        from something,

08:05.719 --> 08:07.586
Joshua?
         Actually, yes.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.822
    Good, it'll have to wait
     until after my story.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.023
      You mean your lies.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.558
               Yeah, you already
                  told me i'd

08:13.560 --> 08:14.726
     Get michael back once.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.194
     You got my brother killed--

08:16.196 --> 08:18.497
    I'll be damned if i get
      fooled by you again.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.599
      Oh, i'm not the one
    who is fooling you now.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.238
It's time to open your eyes.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.206
     Someone else has been
         deceiving you.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.941
                  Here we go.
You should
know the whole

08:29.943 --> 08:32.077
   Truth about your destiny.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.586
April 6, 2008...

08:41.587 --> 08:45.524
Was a special day.
Can anyone tell me why?

08:45.526 --> 08:48.226
     That's the day michael
       was taken from me.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.897
      It was an important
     moment for all of us.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.900
We just
didn't know it.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.036
Ma'am, try to calm down.
    I-i don't want to calm down.
    Take me back to the airport.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.639
     I have to find my son.
     I have to find my son.
Ms. Buckley, my colleagues

09:00.641 --> 09:02.741
Are conducting a full-scale
search and you might really

09:02.743 --> 09:05.010
Be able to help us if you
will just let the nurse give you

09:05.012 --> 09:08.013
             Something to relax.
     I don't want to relax,
    i want to find michael.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.748
               Now, how'd you
           break your arm again?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.950
  Fell off a ladder
cleaning the gutters.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.985
       Uh, you fall a few times?

09:13.987 --> 09:16.154
    Yeah, you know, gutters
    don't clean themselves.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.857
           (laughing)
are you serious?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.659
          He proposed last night
               over dinner.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.561
    Oh, my god.
When can i meet him?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.329
  Well, he's really
   busy right now.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.964
How are you doing? Are you
  doing your breathing?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.800
    This cannot happen here.
        Not in houston.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.237
  Well, it was a real pleasure
praying with you, mr. Franklin.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.773
Now you get some rest,
   no wild parties,

09:34.775 --> 09:36.875
 And we'll see you back
at the church real soon.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.944
You know, the good news is
    is the doctor said

09:38.946 --> 09:41.212
You're doing great.
   So, you know,

09:41.214 --> 09:43.715
   You'll be back to your
20-year-old self in no time.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.318
    I know these group homes can
       be a little rough, peter,

09:46.320 --> 09:49.087
          But we found some nice
      foster parents in arkansas

09:49.089 --> 09:50.589
                  Who would love
                 to take you in.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.224
 (moaning)

09:53.226 --> 09:56.861
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you
tell me what's bothering you?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.105
Can anyone
speak chinese?

10:07.107 --> 10:10.275
          It's true. I was on my
       way to a poker tournament

10:10.277 --> 10:13.278
               In atlantic city.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.946
        Got sick on the layover.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.282
 And april 6 is amy's birthday.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.385
            So what? It's some
            crazy coincidence.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.354
Oh, there are no coincidences.

10:22.356 --> 10:24.089
You crossed paths

10:24.091 --> 10:25.957
Seven years ago because destiny

10:25.959 --> 10:27.759
Was already trying
to bring you together.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.195
And it would have
succeeded

10:30.197 --> 10:32.998
If i hadn't tried
to have rose killed.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.934
     (gunshots, screaming)

10:35.936 --> 10:38.169
Somebody help!

10:38.171 --> 10:39.371
             <i> Help!</i>

10:39.373 --> 10:41.306
    How's rose any different
      from the rest of us?

10:41.308 --> 10:46.144
Because she isn't
who you think she is.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.854
      So, where's the rest
        of your family?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.889
                         Family?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.424
    What else would you call
        the messengers?

10:59.426 --> 11:00.792
                          Right.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.227
They'll be back soon.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.095
             Good.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.364
          But in the meantime...

11:07.701 --> 11:09.167
    ...Tell me what's wrong
           with you.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.669
             What?

11:10.671 --> 11:13.905
    You were in the hospital
         being treated.

11:13.907 --> 11:14.973
              Why?

11:14.975 --> 11:17.809
       I needed surgery.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.910
      That's not possible.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.645
       What do you mean?

11:20.646 --> 11:22.379
 In the beginning, you all felt
    the cost of your gifts.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.982
         It was the same for us.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.218
      A way to know your limits.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.888
But that all goes away once the
 seven messengers are together.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.825
       It's god's reward
    for finding each other.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.694
      Then why am i still
         getting sick?

11:35.696 --> 11:37.328
                    Like i said,

11:37.330 --> 11:40.231
       Something's wrong.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.736
           (whirring)

11:48.208 --> 11:50.709
    I'm gonna make
    a break for it.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.777
 How? It didn't work last time.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.479
 Besides, he said if we leave,
          we're dead.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.880
I'll take my chances.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.849
Rose is in trouble.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.885
(scratching, rock music playing)

12:00.887 --> 12:04.389
              Thought i'd put on
            a little mood music.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.058
               Shall i continue?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.160
Please. We've got
nothing but time.

12:09.162 --> 12:13.865
          You see, rose was shot
         by a young drug addict.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.967
 It wasn't hard to convince him
      to pull the trigger.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.103
        All i had to do
      was offer him a fix.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.771
                  It's funny how
             you seem to show up

12:19.773 --> 12:21.072
                 When people are
               at their weakest.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.374
Too bad it wasn't a fatal shot.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.979
     You see, god hit pause
          on my plan.

12:29.316 --> 12:34.285
   He put rose in a coma and
 summoned me back up to heaven.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.354
  Warned me not to interfere.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.358
  Then he cast me down again.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.499
              Seven years later?

12:47.501 --> 12:50.502
  Barely a blink in god's eye.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.170
                         Anyway,

12:52.171 --> 12:53.837
        You all felt it
     the moment i arrived.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.974
                You were finally
                        awakened

12:55.976 --> 12:58.777
         As messengers
     and given your gifts.

12:58.779 --> 12:59.811
           (whirring)

13:00.447 --> 13:01.846
           (whirring)

13:02.449 --> 13:03.815
           (whirring)

13:03.817 --> 13:05.850
                      Of course,

13:05.852 --> 13:07.786
        Had i known then
        what i know now,

13:07.788 --> 13:08.920
    I would have done things
          differently.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.890
   You see, rose is special.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.958
   Yeah, we're aware of that.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.927
                        Are you?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.896
   How well do you know her?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.300
      (crickets chirping,
          dog barking)

13:22.302 --> 13:24.068
             Erin:
 <i> You told josh where there were</i>

13:24.070 --> 13:26.371
       Other messengers.
           How many?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.106
 We were the sixth generation.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.942
       Destiny called us
  at the end of world war ii.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.144
         God was angry.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.146
                  Just like you,

13:35.148 --> 13:38.950
     We were tested to see
 if humanity was worth saving.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.585
Do you still have your gift?

13:40.587 --> 13:42.086
                             No.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.522
    I stopped having visions
        a long time ago.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.559
 But i'll be the first to admit
       they took a toll.

13:47.561 --> 13:51.563
        I've had some real rough
     patches, and i'm not always

13:51.565 --> 13:53.198
               Right in my mind.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.135
  But right now, i feel clear.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.873
   If only i could figure out
        how to help you.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.045
You may know rose
as a nurse, but

14:07.047 --> 14:09.914
          Do you where
     she got her training?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.418
                       When rose

14:13.420 --> 14:15.987
  Was young, she got her start
          in the army

14:15.989 --> 14:17.889
       As a combat nurse.

14:17.891 --> 14:21.926
     (helicopter whirring)
  <i> she served in afghanistan.</i>

14:21.928 --> 14:26.397
 <i> One night, after an unusually</i>
      <i> gruesome firefight,</i>

14:26.399 --> 14:28.066
        <i> She encountered</i>
      <i> a young lieutenant.</i>

14:28.068 --> 14:29.701
                It hurts so bad.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.335
        I know. I know.
The morphine will kick in soon.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.503
                         Please!

14:32.505 --> 14:33.905
    <i> He was horribly wounded.</i>

14:33.907 --> 14:35.006
I don't want to live like this.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.374
                   Give me more.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.610
        And help me die.

14:38.612 --> 14:39.611
        I can't do that.

14:39.613 --> 14:40.945
      <i> Rose tried her best</i>

14:40.947 --> 14:42.447
 <i> To save him, but even he knew</i>

14:42.449 --> 14:44.249
      <i> He had no chance. </i>
                I'm begging you.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.384
         <i> He begged her</i>
 <i> to put him out of his misery.</i>

14:46.386 --> 14:49.287
                  Let me go home
                       with god.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.358
  <i> So, she made the tough call.</i>

14:53.360 --> 14:55.560
         (man groaning)

14:55.562 --> 14:58.229
     (helicopter whirring)

15:00.533 --> 15:03.268
      <i> She ended his life.</i>

15:09.075 --> 15:12.510
Your dear friend is a murderer.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.379
That's a stretch.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.048
Joshua:
Even if it really did happen,

15:17.050 --> 15:18.549
        Sounds like mercy to me.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.951
                 Yeah, and i can
                  understand why

15:19.953 --> 15:21.986
            She wouldn't want to
        talk to anyone about it.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.388
I've done plenty
of things i'm not proud of.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.622
Sure as hell
not gonna judge her.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.190
     Don't speak too soon.

15:27.994 --> 15:31.329
   That soldier may have been
 the first person rose killed,

15:31.331 --> 15:34.499
        But he certainly
        wasn't the last.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.375
      (crickets chirping)

15:48.949 --> 15:52.016
Sure you want
to get out of here?

15:52.018 --> 15:54.152
                         Joshua:
             More than anything.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.220
Okay.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.190
        I have an idea.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.427
So, what happened to the rest
of your messengers?

16:02.429 --> 16:05.029
    The horsemen were about
    to break the sixth seal.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.665
  But we finally stopped them.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.666
              How?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.201
          By fighting

16:10.203 --> 16:12.070
                 With everything
                         we had.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.405
  You'll have to do the same,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.407
                  But you should
                  know going in,

16:16.409 --> 16:18.376
     Many of you will die.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.113
        (gasps quietly)

16:33.760 --> 16:36.260
      At least i'm honest
      about my dishonesty.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.399
      You've all made a grievous
         error by trusting rose.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.104
So, we're supposed
to just trust you?

16:46.106 --> 16:47.405
I don't think so.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.574
  I'm surprised by you, raul.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.443
      You out of everyone
   should have known better.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.780
           After all,
  you're the undercover agent.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.416
                      Let's see.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.652
How is it you wrangled your way
     into el jefe's cartel?

17:01.654 --> 17:04.021
                   That's right.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.558
            You got close to 'em
     even though you hated them.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.694
   Look, what are you trying
           to get at?

17:10.696 --> 17:12.497
  He's saying it's a long con.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.531
            Meaning?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.567
  You get close to your mark,

17:16.569 --> 17:18.502
       You win their confidence,

17:18.505 --> 17:21.204
       You get them to do
    your dirty work for you.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.673
                     He's saying

17:22.675 --> 17:26.577
  We're the mark, and somehow,
   rose has been conning us.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.082
       Now we're talking.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.687
              Hey. What's wrong?

17:36.689 --> 17:39.257
  Did you hear what she said?

17:40.493 --> 17:42.593
"many of you
will have to die."

17:48.668 --> 17:50.468
            Nadia...

17:50.470 --> 17:53.271
    I don't want you to die!

18:18.665 --> 18:21.666
        (amy screaming)

18:21.668 --> 18:23.801
                    (whimpering)

18:23.803 --> 18:26.604
Amy? What's wrong, sweetie?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.139
                            Amy:
              I had a nightmare.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.208
                           Erin:
                Oh, baby. That's
                 okay. I'm here.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.509
                        (crying)

18:31.511 --> 18:34.445
         Oh, it's okay.
          That's okay.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.682
         Hey, sweetie,

18:37.684 --> 18:39.817
Did you make these?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.820
Amy:
No.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.223
  I've never saw them before.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.525
             Okay.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.727
That's okay.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.769
           (whirring)

18:58.771 --> 19:00.471
        You really think
      rose is conning us?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.606
I'm not saying that.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.508
       Then what are you saying?
I don't know.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.709
    But what if he's right?

19:04.711 --> 19:06.410
     Since when do we trust
           the devil?

19:06.412 --> 19:08.746
 Look, he's not letting us go,
      so we might as well

19:08.748 --> 19:10.615
Hear him out.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.151
The man:
Okay.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.153
       Now, where was i?

19:15.155 --> 19:17.155
           Oh, yeah.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.457
  You're gonna like this part.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.026
           (beeping)

19:22.027 --> 19:24.594
 <i> So after serving her country,</i>
  <i> rose came home and got a job</i>

19:24.597 --> 19:26.764
     <i> At houston memorial. </i>
         (door closes)

19:26.766 --> 19:30.401
 <i> She specialized in taking care</i>
  <i> of terminally-ill patients.</i>

19:30.403 --> 19:33.504
     <i> A very noble calling.</i>

19:33.506 --> 19:36.641
    <i> Trouble is, she brought</i>
     <i> the war home with her.</i>

19:38.244 --> 19:42.880
  <i> So, once again, rose took it</i>
     <i> upon herself to decide</i>

19:42.882 --> 19:45.583
     <i> Who would live or die.</i>

19:45.585 --> 19:48.586
         <i> No one noticed</i>
  <i> when the old and infirm died</i>

19:48.588 --> 19:51.189
      <i> A little bit faster.</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:53.691
       (rhythmic beeping)

19:57.263 --> 19:59.230
  <i> In the span of three years,</i>

19:59.232 --> 20:01.232
        <i> Rose killed six</i>
      <i> elderly patients. </i>
         (droning beep)

20:03.670 --> 20:06.504
 <i> And each time, it got easier.</i>

20:07.707 --> 20:09.607
                   Yeah, i'm not
             buying any of this.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.943
Oh, it's fine.

20:11.945 --> 20:15.446
                 Those six don't
           really matter anyway.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.847
It was rose's seventh victim

20:16.849 --> 20:19.350
 Who put us where we are today.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.752
    You see, rose was having
           an affair

20:21.754 --> 20:24.355
 With a doctor at the hospital.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.692
    <i> Dr. Charles hart refused</i>
       <i> to leave his wife.</i>

20:27.694 --> 20:28.793
           It's over.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.761
    <i> And he ended the affair.</i>

20:30.763 --> 20:32.763
         <i> But sometimes</i>
    <i> opportunities have a way</i>

20:32.765 --> 20:35.600
    <i> Of presenting themselves</i>
   <i> when you least expect it.</i>

20:35.602 --> 20:39.904
    <i> One day, dr. Hart's wife</i>
     <i> was in a car accident.</i>

20:42.008 --> 20:44.342
 <i> After nearly losing his wife,</i>

20:44.344 --> 20:47.712
         <i> Dr. Hart swore</i>
    <i> to be a devoted husband.</i>

20:47.714 --> 20:49.847
          <i> Fortunately,</i>
     <i> mrs. Hart was expected</i>

20:49.849 --> 20:53.551
    <i> To make a full recovery.</i>

20:53.553 --> 20:56.254
      <i> But unfortunately...</i>

20:56.256 --> 20:58.856
     <i> Rose had other plans.</i>

21:02.862 --> 21:06.897
      <i> She killed mrs. Hart</i>
         <i> out of hatred</i>

21:06.899 --> 21:11.269
   <i> And stole her wedding ring</i>
        <i> out of jealousy.</i>

21:11.271 --> 21:13.337
        (rapid beeping)

21:19.445 --> 21:21.479
          (flatlining)

21:27.520 --> 21:30.655
  <i> And that's the exact moment</i>
          <i> rose arvale</i>

21:30.657 --> 21:35.359
        <i> Broke her seal.</i>

21:35.361 --> 21:37.061
        Seven years ago,

21:37.063 --> 21:40.531
On april 6, 2008,

21:40.533 --> 21:44.001
   The first seal was broken.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.936
            Rose...

21:45.938 --> 21:48.005
   Is the horseman of death.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.814
            (moans)

21:57.684 --> 21:58.816
                       Joshua.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.950
Easy, buddy.
We got you.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.553
     He's having a vision.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.589
That's it. Tell us what you see.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.591
                         Joshua,
                     what is it?

22:07.593 --> 22:09.694
     Tell me what you see.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.762
          (chuckling)

22:17.804 --> 22:19.670
          Where is he?

22:19.672 --> 22:20.771
      What have you done?

22:22.942 --> 22:25.776
        Guess the devil
   really is in the details.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.612
        (tires screech)

22:29.582 --> 22:30.848
           (chuckles)

22:36.055 --> 22:38.923
Guess i got to hand it to you.
I took my eye off the ball,

22:38.925 --> 22:41.559
And you took
a chance. Bravo.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.828
But you should know,
you probably just got
your friend killed.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.695
We don't believe that.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.930
                       Just like

22:45.932 --> 22:47.565
We don't believe rose
is the horseman of death.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.899
       No, of course not.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.434
         Let me guess.

22:50.436 --> 22:53.571
    Right now you think rose
   is in some kind of danger.

22:53.573 --> 22:58.476
So joshua must be on his way
to save her. Am i right?

22:58.478 --> 23:02.380
            (scoffs)
  what a tragic waste of time
          and talent.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.982
     Look, rose has been helping
     us from the very beginning.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.650
    She wasn't helping you.
     You were helping her.

23:06.652 --> 23:10.020
 She needed you and your gifts
   to find the next horsemen.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.857
        If that's true,
 then why would you expose her?

23:13.860 --> 23:15.893
Aren't you supposed to be
on the same team?

23:16.896 --> 23:20.131
    You couldn't be farther
        from the truth.

23:20.133 --> 23:22.099
But...

23:22.101 --> 23:23.567
      Don't get me wrong.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.070
       I've collaborated
   with horsemen in the past.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.139
And i'm a big fan of their work.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.675
             War...

23:31.677 --> 23:33.677
         Pestilence...

23:33.679 --> 23:35.513
           Famine...

23:35.515 --> 23:38.649
           And death.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.652
                I love them all.
                    But there is

23:41.654 --> 23:43.854
  A big difference between us.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.358
They want to break all the seals

23:47.359 --> 23:49.059
  And bring about the rapture
    and the end of humanity.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.028
            I don't.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.699
           After all,
 what fun could i possibly have

23:55.701 --> 23:58.169
       Without all of you
         to screw with?

23:58.171 --> 24:01.505
                    I'd be bored
                       to death.

24:01.507 --> 24:02.706
          So you see,

24:02.708 --> 24:05.042
  I don't want the apocalypse.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.778
  I just want the status quo.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.147
          The apocalypse is good
                for the horsemen

24:10.149 --> 24:12.583
  But very bad for you and me.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.453
            I realize that makes
          us strange bedfellows,

24:15.455 --> 24:17.455
             But we actually are
               on the same side.

24:17.457 --> 24:21.091
 And that's why you need to tell
me who joshua saw in his vision.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.626
      I got news for you.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.961
   That's never gonna happen.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.830
Koa:
If we're
on the same side,

24:25.832 --> 24:27.698
       What about peter?

24:27.700 --> 24:30.134
Why did you try to convince him
        to kill himself?

24:30.136 --> 24:33.604
       And what about me
        and my brother?

24:33.606 --> 24:34.738
        Let's be clear.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.707
                       We may be
                         allies,

24:36.709 --> 24:39.577
      But we're definitely
          not friends.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.879
        I thought losing
     a couple of messengers

24:41.881 --> 24:43.814
   Might make things easier.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.785
           Turns out
  they're only getting harder.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.554
 So why are you telling us this
           just now?

24:50.556 --> 24:52.022
         Because, vera,

24:52.024 --> 24:55.559
   The messengers are failing
   for one undeniable reason.

24:55.561 --> 24:56.827
             Rose.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.563
As soon as she became
a horseman, i went to her,

24:59.565 --> 25:00.965
Suggested that we work together.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.701
     But she shot me down.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.737
So i tried to return the favor.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.739
By having her
killed.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.808
        And we all know
      how that turned out.

25:12.712 --> 25:13.711
          Bottom line?

25:13.713 --> 25:16.113
    She needs to be stopped.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.983
    And since i can't do it,

25:18.985 --> 25:21.118
          You need to.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.924
            Did she fall asleep?
        Yeah.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.593
  Your daughter's been touched
    with a gift of her own.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.295
But if she's not a messenger,
then what is she?
Look,

25:31.297 --> 25:32.796
    She's just a kid, okay?

25:32.798 --> 25:34.999
And i don't want her involved
with any of this.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.135
          Who is this?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.537
             Looks like a nurse.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.771
                 Rose, maybe?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.773
       She's our leader.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.775
     Rose. What's her gift?

25:44.777 --> 25:45.876
Understanding.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.211
   She knows every language,

25:47.213 --> 25:48.946
           Translates
    what god wants us to do.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.650
  We didn't have one of those.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.403
       What do you mean?

25:55.404 --> 25:57.655
The gifts of the messengers are
the same with every generation,

25:57.657 --> 25:59.790
And understanding
isn't one of them.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.860
            So that just doesn't
                 make any sense.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.229
           Unless...

26:05.231 --> 26:07.131
          Unless what?

26:07.133 --> 26:10.100
     She's not a messenger.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.210
                     I'm worried
                   about joshua.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.345
     You should be worried
          about rose.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.047
       Don't let him get
       in your head, koa.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.149
                But what if he's
              telling the truth?
Look, guys,

26:25.151 --> 26:27.217
  Can i play devil's advocate
       just for a second?

26:27.219 --> 26:29.270
           Seriously?
(sighs)

26:29.271 --> 26:31.322
         I keep playing joshua's
        visions over in my mind.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.657
    Each of them have led us
     to a horseman, right?

26:33.659 --> 26:35.259
  First war, then pestilence.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.995
           Yeah. So?
So joshua's
first vision

26:37.997 --> 26:39.997
That led him to houston memorial
       where we all met,

26:39.999 --> 26:41.966
   It was of rose, remember?

26:45.171 --> 26:47.071
I hate
that i'm saying this,

26:47.073 --> 26:51.742
  But what if he only saw her
   because she is a horseman?

26:51.744 --> 26:54.044
         Joshua said that he saw
              you with your son.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.380
              Uh, wait a minute,
             are you a horseman?
No.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.182
                  But it doesn't
                         stop me

26:58.184 --> 27:00.918
       From at least considering
                the possibility.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.154
    Rose is not a horseman.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.389
  But no matter what he says,
   this guy is a lying sack!

27:14.634 --> 27:16.033
      How can we be sure?

27:17.703 --> 27:19.770
       Pick up. Pick up.
      Rose, are you there?

27:23.275 --> 27:25.342
           (grunting)

27:26.646 --> 27:28.712
           (panting)

27:32.218 --> 27:34.952
      Where are you, rose?

27:36.656 --> 27:39.923
          Please, god,
   give me some kind of sign.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.910
             Erin:
Look, rose is our leader, okay?

27:59.912 --> 28:02.079
She's
our friend.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.247
              She's an imposter.
           You said it yourself.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.250
      You're still feeling
    the cost of your gifts.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.152
                That wouldn't be
           possible if the seven

28:08.154 --> 28:10.254
  True messengers were united.

28:10.256 --> 28:13.957
           No wonder you all are
  struggling. You're incomplete.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.860
             You'll never defeat
         the horsemen like this.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.430
   If she isn't a messenger,
       then what is she?

28:20.232 --> 28:21.965
  Tell me everything you know

28:21.967 --> 28:23.367
                      About her.
             Okay.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.836
 She was shot seven years ago,

28:25.838 --> 28:28.806
And she stayed in a coma till
destiny brought us all together.

28:28.808 --> 28:29.740
        Seven years ago.

28:29.742 --> 28:30.441
             Yeah.

28:30.443 --> 28:32.376
     That's when i felt it.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.410
           Felt what?

28:33.412 --> 28:36.346
     The first seal break.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.382
What do you mean the <i> first</i> seal?

28:40.720 --> 28:43.153
   Everything rose has told you,
          from beginning to end,

28:43.155 --> 28:44.955
           Is a lie.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.291
        She's one of us.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.992
       We saw her wings.

28:48.994 --> 28:51.462
         That's just...
       Smoke and mirrors.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.297
           I thought
    i was a good con artist.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.364
     Rose puts me to shame.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.467
Vera:
I don't know
what's worse,

28:56.469 --> 28:59.203
     That she used us or...

28:59.205 --> 29:01.872
     I'm actually starting
        to believe you.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.374
     In that case, tell me
 who joshua saw in his vision,

29:04.376 --> 29:06.744
                      And i will
                     let you go.
No.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.212
Because it still doesn't add up.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.780
When vera tried

29:09.782 --> 29:11.315
    To stop leland schiller,

29:11.317 --> 29:13.117
   Why did you argue for him
       to break his seal?

29:13.119 --> 29:14.485
                  You wanted him

29:14.487 --> 29:16.420
     To become a horseman.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.522
 All the things you've done and
all the things you're gonna do.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.957
Come on, leland.
Press the button.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.060
    You're absolutely right.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.329
     'cause i still thought
 i could convince the horsemen

29:25.331 --> 29:27.064
     To ride under my rule
       instead of rose's.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.399
          It turns out
     rose got to 'em first.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.101
      She allied with them
      from the beginning.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.137
                           So...

29:33.139 --> 29:35.005
   Once i realized i couldn't
    get them to work for me,

29:35.007 --> 29:37.074
        I had no choice
      but to turn to you.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.776
                            Hey.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.477
None of this would have happened
 if vera had simply killed rose

29:40.479 --> 29:42.079
      When i asked her to.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.348
   You do remember what happened
         when you failed, right?

29:46.285 --> 29:47.818
       (inhales sharply)
            (gasps)

29:51.090 --> 29:53.090
          (distorted):
  <i> Ikiwa ja mamatay sen zullen</i>

29:53.092 --> 29:55.559
  <i> Niciodata fumanisa ceteros.</i>

29:55.561 --> 29:57.094
       Yeah, she woke up

29:57.096 --> 29:59.296
      And started speaking
   in some strange language.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.265
   The language of the dead.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.500
                She had the gall
                      to tell me

30:03.502 --> 30:05.869
That even my days were numbered.
           (chuckles)

30:05.871 --> 30:07.871
                           Raul:
                    Okay. Enough
                   storytelling.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.139
         I want proof.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.541
                        You want
                          proof?

30:10.543 --> 30:14.478
   Ask and you shall receive.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.314
 How 'bout a little surveillance
         video from just outside

30:17.316 --> 30:20.384
Of county jail.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.824
          Why is rose
     with leland schiller?

30:26.826 --> 30:28.959
What do you think?

30:28.961 --> 30:31.045
    She's posting his bail.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.130
After all the work
you did to stop him,

30:33.132 --> 30:35.165
        She's the reason
    he still broke his seal.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.168
 We only felt two seals break.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.403
         I felt three.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.172
                    It all makes
                 sense now. See?

30:42.174 --> 30:45.342
      Here. April 6, 2008.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.177
         That's the day
       that amy was born.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.580
          And the day
     the first seal broke.

30:49.582 --> 30:52.349
   Rose must have broken it.
                           Wait.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.152
    So if rose broke a seal,
     then you're saying...

30:55.154 --> 30:57.888
     She isn't a messenger.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.190
       She's a horseman.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.859
        If that's legit,

31:01.861 --> 31:03.894
   It means there's one more
 horseman than what we thought.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.963
      And one less chance
         to stop them.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.165
     When did this happen?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.633
      Didn't anyone think
         it was strange

31:09.635 --> 31:12.035
   That rose was conveniently
          out of town

31:12.037 --> 31:14.638
The day leland schiller got out
           of prison?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.607
   Where did she say she was?

31:16.609 --> 31:18.275
                        Seattle.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.115
                    Visiting her
                      ex-fiancé.

31:25.117 --> 31:28.018
      So sweet. Except...

31:28.020 --> 31:29.586
      There is no fiancé.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.422
 And she never went to seattle.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.492
She was
too busy plotting

31:35.494 --> 31:37.628
     To get leland schiller
       to break his seal.

31:37.630 --> 31:40.998
       <i> She got bail money</i>
      <i> from cindy richards.</i>

31:42.601 --> 31:44.935
    <i> She bailed leland out...</i>

31:44.937 --> 31:46.904
       <i> And convinced him</i>

31:46.906 --> 31:48.472
        <i> To kill hundreds</i>
        <i> at nero health,</i>

31:48.474 --> 31:51.174
   <i> Finally breaking his seal.</i>

31:52.311 --> 31:54.311
                           Vera:
                If this is true,
                why wouldn't you

31:54.313 --> 31:56.346
               Just tell us from
             the very beginning?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.584
        Because, vera...

32:00.586 --> 32:02.586
       I am the "devil."

32:05.557 --> 32:07.958
           You never
    would have believed me.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.927
                    And you know
                  what they say:

32:09.929 --> 32:12.562
                 "every rose has
                    its thorns."

32:12.564 --> 32:15.933
    I just hope joshua sees that
           before it's too late.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.935
                      Rose!

32:22.374 --> 32:24.408
             Rose!

32:24.410 --> 32:26.276
  (rumbling, scraping nearby)

32:34.320 --> 32:36.520
      (scraping, creaking)

32:51.971 --> 32:54.037
              ¶ ¶

33:02.014 --> 33:03.547
            Joshua.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.582
           Rose. Hey.

33:06.552 --> 33:07.617
         Are you hurt?

33:07.619 --> 33:09.519
  Hurry. Before he comes back.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.694
                   Let's get you
                    out of here.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.029
                   There you go.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.263
        Joshua.
                           What?

33:20.265 --> 33:21.498
Have you had a vision?
                      Yeah.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.133
Joshua!

33:23.134 --> 33:24.767
        Do you know who
     the next horseman is?

33:24.770 --> 33:26.770
     Rose, come on, we got to...
No, joshua, wait,

33:26.772 --> 33:28.205
        It's important--
      you have to tell me.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.506
        Now. Who is it?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.675
Who did you see?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.744
          I saw two brothers.

33:33.746 --> 33:36.279
     What are their names?

33:43.756 --> 33:45.756
     The farrell brothers.

33:45.758 --> 33:49.059
   They have a mining company
       in west virginia.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.230
       Thank you, joshua.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.045
                         Rose...

34:09.047 --> 34:11.648
       What's happening?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.382
Oh, joshua,

34:13.385 --> 34:16.219
     What good is the gift
      of prophetic vision

34:16.221 --> 34:19.688
   If you don't pay attention
        to what you see?

34:22.127 --> 34:25.328
 You were right in front of me
        the whole time.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.534
      You're one of them.

34:32.337 --> 34:34.771
       What do you want?

34:34.773 --> 34:38.141
       What does death...

34:38.143 --> 34:40.243
          Always want?

34:52.591 --> 34:54.324
             Vera:
Okay, we listened to your story.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.324
Now let us go.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.592
    To save joshua or rose?

34:56.594 --> 34:58.495
   Just open the damn doors.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.230
        Okay. Very well.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.666
       I guess it's time
     you see for yourself.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.701
          Either way,
    only one thing matters.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.369
                     You need to
                      understand

35:06.371 --> 35:09.439
That i <i> am</i> telling you the truth.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.175
  (deep whirring, clattering)

35:19.818 --> 35:21.751
             Wait a minute.
            You promised me

35:21.753 --> 35:24.287
     If listened to your stories
            i'd get my son back.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.623
          Now, where is michael?
You are persistent.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.561
          What the hell is this?

35:31.563 --> 35:33.530
            The man:
         Saint monica.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.666
  The patron saint of mothers.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.768
           Yeah, this isn't what
          you promised me, okay?

35:38.770 --> 35:40.303
      And what about the others?

35:40.305 --> 35:43.240
    Don't worry, they'll get
     what's coming to them.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.475
              Koa:
             Vera.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.377
                        Come on.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.685
  You helped me so much, rose.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.755
  I know there's a good person
         inside there.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.757
                  You don't have
                     to do this.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.359
             She helped me, too.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.794
   Yeah. Hell of a horseman.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.397
                           Rose:
                   I helped them
                  see the light.

36:07.399 --> 36:08.932
    The end is here, joshua,

36:08.934 --> 36:11.168
  And it will cleanse us all.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.435
         Thanks to you,

36:12.437 --> 36:13.703
Now we're going
to find

36:13.705 --> 36:15.672
      The final horseman.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.274
Cindy:
We'll make sure
that he breaks

36:17.276 --> 36:18.942
            The seal before your
           friends can stop him.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.212
  It's like i've always said.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.715
     There's only one path
          to paradise.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.590
                       (panting)

36:44.770 --> 36:47.737
     Rest in peace, joshua.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.424
                    (whimpering,
                      trembling)

37:10.395 --> 37:11.928
            Rose...

37:11.930 --> 37:13.997
               (gasping breaths)

37:16.668 --> 37:18.401
          What is it?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.737
         My... Vision.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.242
          (whispers):
            I lied.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.884
  They're still not answering.
    I don't know what to do.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.653
                They should have
               been back by now.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.389
         God help them.
      God help all of you.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.858
Sorry. I'm not waiting for god.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.694
            Where are you going?
To find our friends.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.029
                   Peter, don't.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.698
                 You'll be fine.
                   I'll be back.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.967
        (phone ringing)

37:50.969 --> 37:53.470
           Hey, vera, we've been
            trying to reach you.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.538
                Wait, slow down.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.009
                  Okay, we'll be
                    right there.

37:59.011 --> 38:00.543
                  Watch amy.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.724
        Let's split up.
    We have to find joshua.

38:17.763 --> 38:20.297
               Joshua!

38:22.634 --> 38:24.968
                Guys, over here.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.780
            Joshua?

38:36.782 --> 38:38.448
            Josh...

38:48.794 --> 38:50.860
Peter, can you see?

38:59.338 --> 39:00.503
                        (grunts)

39:00.505 --> 39:02.772
           (scraping)

39:08.547 --> 39:10.980
(crying):
No. No, no, no.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.553
Joshua.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.124
              ¶ ¶

39:23.428 --> 39:26.396
  ¶ baby, yeah, there is... ¶

39:26.398 --> 39:28.932
       It's not working.
       I can't heal him.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.835
        He's-he's gone.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.938
              ¶ ¶

39:34.940 --> 39:37.107
        ¶ lately there ¶

39:37.109 --> 39:39.376
    ¶ has been a cloud... ¶

39:42.047 --> 39:43.780
                   I hate to say
                  i told you so.

39:43.782 --> 39:46.916
              ¶ ¶

39:46.918 --> 39:49.586
         You knew this was gonna
             happen, didn't you?

39:49.588 --> 39:51.421
                  The man: Don't
                     look at me.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.889
     This is all on joshua.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.858
         If he'd stayed
     like the rest of you,

39:54.860 --> 39:56.993
          None of this
      would have happened.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.962
                     But look at
                the bright side.

39:58.964 --> 40:03.133
      Now you finally know
    what you're up against.

40:03.135 --> 40:06.536
Rose will stop at nothing until
  she finds the next horseman.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.972
                We can stop her.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.173
       There is no "we."

40:10.175 --> 40:11.541
  Just tell me what joshua saw

40:11.543 --> 40:13.009
      In his last vision--
       that's all i ask.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.677
Why would we
tell you anything?

40:14.679 --> 40:17.480
            The man:
Because you want to save joshua.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.682
      We can't save him--
           he's dead.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.619
     He doesn't have to be.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.687
       What do you mean?

40:24.689 --> 40:26.923
               Joshua was right.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.827
      I can't kill people.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.897
  But what if i told you i can
 bring him back from the dead?

40:33.899 --> 40:36.566
¶ but no news is good news... ¶

40:36.568 --> 40:39.102
       But if you give me
         what i want...

40:40.906 --> 40:43.940
 ...I'll resurrect your friend.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.809
              No.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.677
          It's a trap.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.946
      Guys, this is joshua
      we're talking about.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.115
    We don't have a choice.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.684
                          Peter:
                    She's right.
             Eliza said it takes

40:54.686 --> 40:56.786
               All of us to stop
                   the horsemen.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.889
        I'm telling you,
        it's a mistake.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.024
        We need joshua.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.126
             Raul.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.464
            The man:
        What do you say?

41:09.468 --> 41:12.535
            Deal...

41:12.537 --> 41:13.937
          Or no deal?
