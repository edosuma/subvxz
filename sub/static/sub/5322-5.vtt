WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:03.860
- I am so excited to see you tomorrow. - Me too.

00:04.059 --> 00:06.240
We're finally going to consummate our relationship!

00:06.240 --> 00:08.260
And we're gonna have sex for the first time.

00:09.950 --> 00:13.630
Speaking of which, I got my STD test.

00:13.950 --> 00:15.980
You mean your "Safe to do it" test?

00:16.320 --> 00:17.980
Yup, clean as a whistle,

00:18.380 --> 00:20.690
though whistles aren't actually very clean at all.

00:20.690 --> 00:23.250
The mouth is a haven for harmful bacteria.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.520
All right. Save that for the bedroom.

00:26.690 --> 00:29.180
Well, I'm getting my test after work, but don't worry.

00:29.180 --> 00:31.680
I've only been with one person since the last time I was tested.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.380
Yeah, and just casually asking, who was that one other guy?

00:34.720 --> 00:36.370
Uh... it's not important.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.430
What is important is the next time we're together,

00:38.430 --> 00:40.620
we're gonna be together.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.500
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:43.820 --> 00:44.980
Though for me, with the time change,

00:44.980 --> 00:47.480
it'll actually be yesterday, in which case, we already had sex.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.060
- How were we? -Amazing!

00:52.190 --> 00:54.720
Thank you, online tech support person man.

00:57.980 --> 01:00.730
- Hello, Josh. - Gabi.

01:00.850 --> 01:03.490
If you have a computer problem, you can come to me.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.330
You know... the last guy you had sex with.

01:07.990 --> 01:10.070
Were you listening to my private conversation?

01:10.260 --> 01:12.360
Your private conversation that you were having in my kitchen

01:12.360 --> 01:15.230
- with my Internet on my laptop? - My god, that's a good point.

01:16.090 --> 01:18.280
So wait, you were with Cooper in China for three weeks,

01:18.280 --> 01:19.780
sharing a bed, and nothing?

01:19.860 --> 01:22.080
- I knew you for less than three hours and we-- - I know!

01:23.850 --> 01:24.960
That's why I was being careful.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.420
I mean, the last person I had sex with,

01:26.420 --> 01:28.470
it kind of ended up a big mess.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.140
So, what I'm hearing

01:30.440 --> 01:32.580
is that no man could possibly measure up

01:32.580 --> 01:35.000
to that big... handsome mess.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.820
No, what you're hearing is me politely asking

01:38.820 --> 01:40.660
if I can leave work early and go to the clinic.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.620
So you can get your "Safe to do it"

01:41.620 --> 01:43.540
- cause you haven't "Done it yet" test? - Yes, that's the one.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.100
Yes, you can go, but look,

01:46.100 --> 01:47.220
you have nothing to worry about. I'm safe.

01:47.220 --> 01:48.510
Yeah, you are, but you know how they say

01:48.510 --> 01:49.340
when you have sex with someone,

01:49.340 --> 01:51.110
you have sex with everybody they've had sex with?

01:51.110 --> 01:52.510
Gabi, the only other person I was sleeping with 

01:52.510 --> 01:53.810
when I slept with you was Caroline.

01:53.810 --> 01:54.440
New plan.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.470
We're both getting tested. I'll call my doctor.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074

02:19.630 --> 02:21.460
Your doctor's office is really nice.

02:21.460 --> 02:22.410
At the clinic that I go to,

02:22.410 --> 02:23.800
if you didn't have something walking in,

02:23.890 --> 02:25.460
you're gonna have something walking out.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.630
You're paying, right?

02:27.870 --> 02:29.200
Only if it's good news!

02:31.090 --> 02:32.240
I'm sorry. I'm just really nervous.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.420
This is mine and Cooper's first time.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.500
Oh god! What if I have something?

02:36.500 --> 02:37.910
That could kill the whole night!

02:38.170 --> 02:40.740
- Gabi, you're fine. - You don't know that!

02:40.750 --> 02:42.470
I mean, we waited such a long time,

02:42.470 --> 02:44.010
and he paid so much for the hotel room.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.450
I mean, not that he told me how much,

02:45.450 --> 02:47.080
but I definitely looked it up online.

02:47.670 --> 02:50.100
And he's trying to make it so special for me,

02:50.420 --> 02:51.940
and I already bought the cap and gown.

02:54.630 --> 02:55.820
Cap and gown?

02:55.820 --> 02:57.410
Oh. God, do you think it's too much?

02:57.410 --> 02:58.550
I thought it'd be really hot

02:58.550 --> 03:00.770
if I rolled up my test results like a diploma...

03:00.770 --> 03:02.670
...dress up in a sexy cap and gown,

03:02.670 --> 03:03.800
Get it? 'cause we're graduating

03:03.800 --> 03:05.560
to the next level of our relationship--

03:05.560 --> 03:07.370
- the sex level. - I get it.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.710
I'm trying to un-get it.

03:11.020 --> 03:11.930
I'm sorry, am I saying too much?

03:11.930 --> 03:13.340
I don't know if you know this, but when I'm nervous,

03:13.340 --> 03:16.020
- I really seem to talk a lot. - Yeah. Only when you're nervous.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.910
All right, I've looked over your C.B.C. Chem-7 test panel,

03:18.910 --> 03:20.850
and checked out your S.T.I. serologic test--

03:20.850 --> 03:22.290
Oh my god! I'm dying!

03:23.940 --> 03:26.740
- Calm down, you're both fine. - Oh good.

03:27.820 --> 03:29.780
And may I just say, it was really responsible

03:29.780 --> 03:32.160
for the two of you to come in to be tested together.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.970
I really wish more couples were like you.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.350
Yay! Now I get to go have sex with my boyfriend.

03:37.410 --> 03:38.540
Thanks, boss.

03:39.460 --> 03:40.600
Don't ask.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.670
Oh, Yolanda.

03:47.430 --> 03:48.560
Yolanda?

03:49.760 --> 03:50.870
What the hell?

03:52.560 --> 03:54.430
I come get my tooth pulled,

03:55.230 --> 03:56.110
and I wake up in the hallway

03:56.110 --> 03:58.720
making out with my ex-husband? Unbelievable.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.870
Yes, it is.

04:00.650 --> 04:01.910
Gabi, you know Coleman.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.290
He's the guy that broke Yolanda's heart by cheating on her.

04:04.970 --> 04:07.040
You know, normally, I'd be eating this up, but...

04:07.040 --> 04:08.680
Cooper and I are having sex for the first time tonight,

04:08.680 --> 04:09.820
so bye!

04:11.660 --> 04:14.140
Come on, Josh. Can't we just start over?

04:14.260 --> 04:15.990
If you mean you and Yolanda, no.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.600
But if you mean you and me, no.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.190
Well, then do you have another reason to be here?

04:21.230 --> 04:23.240
No. Bye-bye, Josh.

04:24.860 --> 04:25.990
We'll talk about this later.

04:28.990 --> 04:30.570
That was a little uncomfortable.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.200
- You're telling me. - Yeah.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.050
Now where were we?

04:45.330 --> 04:47.560
Sofia, this is a five-star hotel.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.550
That's, like, all of the stars!

04:49.670 --> 04:51.020
Well, don't just stand there.

04:51.180 --> 04:52.550
Help me raid the mini-bar.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.260
I already got the shampoo and condish for ya.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.110
Things are about to get sexy.

05:01.110 --> 05:02.070
Yes.

05:02.460 --> 05:05.170
- A five-star sexy! - Yeah.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.500
This bed is so sexy.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.030
Chocolates on the pillow!

05:10.270 --> 05:11.830
Super sexy.

05:16.660 --> 05:17.270
Hello?

05:17.270 --> 05:19.460
It's me, calling you from the bathroom!

05:22.210 --> 05:23.430
I'm here!

05:25.140 --> 05:26.550
- And you are here. - Oh my god!

05:26.550 --> 05:28.280
There's the coolest mirror in here!

05:28.290 --> 05:29.610
And Sofia's here!

05:30.740 --> 05:34.120
Hey, Cooper! Have fun, you two.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.660
I'm gonna wash my hair and make tiny drinks.

05:42.380 --> 05:44.530
- Hi. - Hi.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.090
- Wait, wait, let me set the mood. - Okay.

05:47.090 --> 05:48.770
You know how in those romantic movies you like,

05:48.770 --> 05:50.830
- there's always rose petals on the bed? - Yeah.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.320
They were supposed to cascade and flutter,

05:58.320 --> 06:00.300
but my hands are sweaty, 'cause I'm really nervous.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.090
Well, maybe this will calm you down.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.730
No, no, no.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.450
Did I really blow it with the rose-petal clump that bad?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.500
No, I have a surprise for you. Sit down, close your eyes.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.950
- I don't want you to see. - Don't worry.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.500
My glasses are already fogged up.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.770
Okay, this is happening.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.670
This is really happening.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.700
Calm down, Cooper.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.790
You too, mini-Cooper.

06:24.270 --> 06:25.590
Okay, open your eyes.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.100
This is so much better than my graduation from M.I.T.

06:37.350 --> 06:38.840
'Cause the girls weren't as pretty?

06:38.840 --> 06:40.200
And my mother isn't here.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.810
Proof positive that I am negative.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.580
- You are amazing. - And safe to do it.

06:48.980 --> 06:51.090
- Why does this say, "Josh Kaminski"? - What?

06:52.830 --> 06:54.480
They can never spell my name right!

07:00.750 --> 07:04.120
Gabi, I work with computers, so I'm not too good with people,

07:04.120 --> 07:05.430
But I'm pretty sure you handing me

07:05.430 --> 07:08.860
Josh's S.T.D. test results is the worst foreplay ever.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.870
Okay, remember that one thing I said I'd never let you do?

07:14.130 --> 07:15.420
I'll let you.

07:17.350 --> 07:18.620
Gabi, what's going on?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.120
Okay, listen, don't freak out,

07:21.130 --> 07:22.850
because it meant absolutely nothing.

07:22.850 --> 07:26.450
- Oh god, you're sleeping with Josh! - No, slept with.

07:26.450 --> 07:28.940
It's like when I got my hair cornrowed?

07:28.950 --> 07:31.340
It was one time, in the past, and I totally regretted it!

07:32.240 --> 07:34.130
He's the one guy you had sex with?

07:34.140 --> 07:36.540
It was the night of my trial dinner to be Josh's new chef.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.890
- That's how you got the job? - No!

07:39.750 --> 07:41.380
I slept with him after I got the job.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.430
Him and Caroline had just broken up, he was devastated,

07:44.430 --> 07:46.010
I was drunk...

07:46.560 --> 07:49.280
Yeah, well, I'm about to be both of those things.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.150
Okay. You're mad.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.390
Can you channel that passion and throw me onto the bed?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.800
I'm outta here.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.170
Cooper, you can't just leave.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.390
You're right.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.960
I spent 13 hours on a plane,

08:11.960 --> 08:14.350
paid $800 for this beautiful hotel suite,

08:14.360 --> 08:16.520
tried a little something called manscaping...

08:18.450 --> 08:20.740
all so we could have this magical night together.

08:21.980 --> 08:23.620
So you know what? I am gonna stay.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.920
Oh, thank god.

08:26.790 --> 08:27.950
You're leaving.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.680
Leaving? In shame?

08:30.850 --> 08:32.580
This is like my high school graduation all over again,

08:32.580 --> 08:34.570
except that time, I did have sex,

08:34.570 --> 08:35.960
and I did not get a diploma.

08:42.150 --> 08:43.230
Sign there...

08:44.410 --> 08:45.510
and there.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.610
Initial there.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.020
And you are officially gay!

08:52.800 --> 08:55.500
Nothing? That gay stuff usually kills.

08:56.740 --> 08:58.330
I'm sorry, Elliot, I just can't stop thinking

08:58.330 --> 09:00.070
about Yolanda making out with Coleman.

09:00.230 --> 09:04.130
I know. It's like he fell into the hippo pit at the zoo,

09:04.130 --> 09:05.540
managed to escape,

09:05.540 --> 09:07.280
and then jumped right back in again!

09:10.770 --> 09:13.290
Look, I know it's late and my day off,

09:13.490 --> 09:15.860
so if you wanna pay me overtime, go right ahead.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.630
But that's not why I'm here.

09:18.740 --> 09:21.230
I want to talk about the elephant in the room.

09:21.450 --> 09:22.550
Shut up, Elliot!

09:24.380 --> 09:27.450
Look, Yolanda, I know I'm just your boss,

09:27.760 --> 09:29.180
but I'm also the boss whose couch you cried on

09:29.180 --> 09:30.570
every time he cheated on you.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.200
I hear you, and I want you to know I ended it with him,

09:34.520 --> 09:37.710
which is why I'm going to Napa this weekend

09:37.710 --> 09:39.550
with my girlfriends to drown myself 

09:39.550 --> 09:42.250
in a big barrel of pinot noir.

09:43.310 --> 09:46.370
You know, to forget Coleman's pinot noir.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.770
Good. Good.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.300
I really think this is for the best.

09:54.190 --> 09:57.660
By the way, what were you doing at the doctor's offce, anyway?

09:58.160 --> 10:00.640
Were you so worried you were following me?

10:01.080 --> 10:02.520
Uh, no.

10:03.540 --> 10:06.150
Gabi and I were actually getting S.T.D. tests.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.000
Come on, you can admit it.

10:09.230 --> 10:10.870
No, I'm being serious. Look.

10:16.170 --> 10:18.430
Gabi's Vitamin D is really low.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.460
- What? - These are Gabi's results.

10:22.460 --> 10:23.890
What do you mean, "Gabi's results"?

10:24.310 --> 10:26.150
Oh my god, I gotta call her right now.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.210
Calm down, baby. 

10:27.210 --> 10:29.440
That little pale girl just needs to get some sun.

10:31.820 --> 10:33.830
These are Gabi's results, which means she has my results,

10:33.830 --> 10:35.630
and she's gonna dress up all sexy in a cap and gown

10:35.630 --> 10:37.090
and hand 'em to Cooper like a diploma.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.710
And people think gay sex is weird.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.220
Hey, Cooper.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.190
A bottle of bubbly for the lovebirds.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.130
Gabi's not here...

10:54.790 --> 10:56.410
and I saw your test results.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.020
How about 'em, huh? Weren't they great?

10:59.730 --> 11:01.250
That's why I gave a copy to my employees.

11:02.150 --> 11:03.190
Stop.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.560
Gabi told me everything,

11:05.570 --> 11:06.800
I know you guys had sex together,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.960
and obviously you have feelings for her.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.550
- What? No, that's so-- - It all makes sense--

11:11.790 --> 11:13.700
why you didn't want us to date when I was working for you,

11:13.700 --> 11:15.390
why you punched me in the face.

11:15.390 --> 11:17.740
That had nothing to do with Gabi. We were drunk.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.690
Alcohol really seems to be the excuse for everyone around here.

11:20.690 --> 11:23.060
You know what? You people really have a problem!

11:25.350 --> 11:28.120
Cooper, look, even if I were into her,

11:28.120 --> 11:30.090
the reality is, she's into you.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.150
She's always talking about you,

11:32.150 --> 11:33.890
her face lights up during your video chats,

11:33.900 --> 11:36.310
and she was so excited to dress up in the cap and gown.

11:36.490 --> 11:38.120
She told you about that?

11:38.390 --> 11:40.210
She talks a lot when she's nervous.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.340
Just tell me, man to man...

11:45.440 --> 11:46.900
do you have feelings for her?

11:50.090 --> 11:51.910
If I did, would I be here right now,

11:51.910 --> 11:53.750
trying to get you two to work things out?

11:55.870 --> 11:57.790
Come on, man! You like her,

11:57.840 --> 11:59.800
she likes you. Go get her.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.440
Don't tell me what to do!

12:02.100 --> 12:04.120
I will go get her. Not because you told me to.

12:09.930 --> 12:10.940
Yolanda?

12:11.270 --> 12:14.110
- Josh! - Aren't you supposed to be at Napa?

12:14.280 --> 12:17.780
No! I said I was gonna take a napa.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.900
Baby, what's taking so long?

12:22.790 --> 12:26.000
That's Tammy. She's got a nasty cold.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.720
Ooh, throat just raw.

12:28.210 --> 12:29.890
Come on, Yolanda.

12:30.070 --> 12:31.210
Bring it.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.170
Sweetie, you should stop talking.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.750
You're only making it worse.

12:36.970 --> 12:39.320
No, you're making it worse.

12:39.460 --> 12:42.260
All right, fine! Tammy's Coleman.

12:42.270 --> 12:44.940
- No! - Look, Josh,

12:45.060 --> 12:46.040
I know what you're thinking.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.410
I should just end it and leave with you right now.

12:48.410 --> 12:51.830
- Exactly. Let's go. - I can't just leave him.

12:51.830 --> 12:54.400
Why? Because you have no willpower?

12:54.400 --> 12:57.090
- Because you're falling for him again? - No!

12:58.220 --> 13:00.350
Because he's handcuffed to the headboard.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.050
Oh my god.

13:08.110 --> 13:10.510
My boobs are huge!

13:17.430 --> 13:20.830
God, Sofia, why didn't I tell Cooper about Josh earlier?

13:20.940 --> 13:22.880
Because guys don't want to hear about past hookups.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.870
- They can't handle it. - Why?

13:25.900 --> 13:27.500
I mean, why can't couples be like best friends

13:27.500 --> 13:28.880
and tell each other everything...

13:28.880 --> 13:30.280
like us?

13:30.430 --> 13:32.480
- Totally. - Yeah, and we would never have to worry about

13:32.480 --> 13:34.740
lying or keeping secrets from each other.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.830
Total. 

13:36.370 --> 13:39.050
Oh god, Sofia, it so great having a best friend,

13:39.050 --> 13:40.660
'cause no matter if something's hard to hear,

13:40.660 --> 13:43.480
we just still say it, because we trust each other.

13:45.210 --> 13:46.270
Totally.

13:48.590 --> 13:51.170
Although-- and I'm not thinking of anything in particular here,

13:51.170 --> 13:52.780
but we might not tell each other...

13:53.120 --> 13:55.590
- Everything. - Oh please!

13:55.650 --> 13:57.410
Do you remember your Halle Berry haircut?

13:57.410 --> 14:00.140
Who told you that it made you look like John Leguizamo?

14:03.840 --> 14:06.920
- You did. - And why would I do that?

14:07.460 --> 14:09.260
Because you love me and want the best for me.

14:09.260 --> 14:10.780
That's right, and you would do the same for me.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.020
We tell each other everything, no matter what.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.890
It's called "trust."

14:16.860 --> 14:20.340
There's actually one thing I might have neglected to tell you,

14:21.030 --> 14:23.370
but we're gonna need the big bottle for that one.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.090
Okay. 

14:28.710 --> 14:31.040
I've waited a really long time to tell you this,

14:31.040 --> 14:32.400
and, god, it's been killing me,

14:32.400 --> 14:34.860
but I swear the only reason I didn't tell you

14:34.860 --> 14:37.460
was because you seemed so happy with Cooper and...

14:37.940 --> 14:39.030
okay.

14:40.060 --> 14:43.310
The night that Josh broke off his wedding,

14:43.600 --> 14:45.220
he climbed up the fire escape

14:45.220 --> 14:46.660
to tell you he had feelings for you,

14:46.660 --> 14:48.540
but then he saw you kissing Cooper,

14:48.540 --> 14:50.590
and he was devastated, so he left.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.200
And then when I found out, he swore me to secrecy.

14:54.410 --> 14:55.940
Oh god, I should've told you.

14:56.580 --> 14:57.900
I'm so sorry.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.080
Do you forgive me?

15:02.410 --> 15:04.420
Oh my god, you didn't hear a word I said.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.470
No, but I did.

15:08.780 --> 15:12.330
Well, let me guess. Gabi left her keys in the door again!

15:17.010 --> 15:19.200
Cooper, I'm sorry you had to find out 

15:19.200 --> 15:20.840
about Josh and Gabi this way.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.080
But, you know, it's time everybody knew.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.870
- Apparently, everyone did know. - No, not Gabi,

15:26.070 --> 15:28.020
but she's gonna find out as soon as she wakes up,

15:28.020 --> 15:30.340
- because I cannot keep this from her anymore. - You're right.

15:30.390 --> 15:31.660
She needs to know.

15:33.210 --> 15:35.770
Just... let me be the one to tell her.

15:36.580 --> 15:39.630
- Why? - I need to see her face when she finds out.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.750
It's the only way I'll know if she has feelings for Josh.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.490
Okay, but I'm the one that's been keeping this from her,

15:43.490 --> 15:44.800
so I should be the one to tell her.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.270
You can stay in my hotel room.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.740
I don't think that-- really?

15:50.370 --> 15:53.220
Okay, but she needs to know that I tried to tell her the truth.

15:53.690 --> 15:55.020
Promise me you'll tell her.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.460
I will.

16:02.330 --> 16:05.020
- Oh, and, Cooper... - Yes, you can order room service.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.630
- And...? - And a movie.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.770
Yolanda promised up and down she's never gonna see Coleman again,

16:18.780 --> 16:22.010
- so why are we at his office? - Because Yolanda is weak.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.120
All Coleman has to do is call her, and she caves.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.460
So we're gonna confront Coleman,

16:25.460 --> 16:26.800
make sure he never contacts her again.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.700
Oh, so that's why you brought me.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.310
I'm the bad cop! I'm the muscle!

16:31.310 --> 16:32.920
I'm the heavy!

16:34.020 --> 16:35.580
I'm missing a tassel on my loafer.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.450
Coleman.

16:42.910 --> 16:46.370
- Look, we need to talk man to man. - To man!

16:47.530 --> 16:49.930
- O-- okay. - I love Yolanda.

16:49.930 --> 16:52.050
And I... work with her.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.020
And we both care about her.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.100
Okay, so... what's the problem?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.370
The problem is, we are worried.

16:59.370 --> 17:00.950
You are emotionally closed off

17:00.960 --> 17:03.420
and prone to infidelity.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.970
All right, let's put the tiger back in the cage.

17:08.550 --> 17:09.990
Coleman, look...

17:10.670 --> 17:12.339
Yolanda can't see it, but she's falling for you again,

17:12.339 --> 17:13.680
and that's dangerous.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.390
So, if you care about her, you gotta leave her alone,

17:16.390 --> 17:18.609
because when it comes to you, she has no self-control.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.440
The hell I don't!

17:23.020 --> 17:26.300
I can end it with Coleman any time I want!

17:26.510 --> 17:28.369
Wait, hold up. Yolanda...

17:29.620 --> 17:31.030
are you falling in love with me?

17:32.070 --> 17:33.340
Well, Coleman...

17:33.720 --> 17:36.170
I did not see this coming.

17:37.420 --> 17:38.810
This changes everything.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.340
Yolanda, I'm sorry.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.200
Because I am falling for you again, too.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.360
You are?

17:46.500 --> 17:47.910
Damn right I am.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.620
I'm lucky I get a second chance to make things right.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.010
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.680
Because you butted in,

18:02.680 --> 18:04.970
they're actually closer than they were before.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.680
Thank you, Elliot.

18:07.140 --> 18:10.060
I mean, if it wasn't for you coming down here,

18:10.060 --> 18:13.160
they might not be a couple, but because you did,

18:13.160 --> 18:17.900
- they are. - I get it, Elliot.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.870
Now get out, so I can get it.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.430
The sex that's about to happen

18:25.430 --> 18:27.350
is because of you.

18:37.010 --> 18:40.520
Sofia, you have the soft skin of a little girl.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.940
It's Cooper, and I occasionally moisturize.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.650
Cooper, what are you doing here?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.390
I mean, I 'm happy you're here, but...

18:52.160 --> 18:53.330
Hi.

18:54.790 --> 18:57.820
I feel horrible that I kicked you out of the hotel room last night.

18:57.820 --> 18:58.770
Yeah, that was not the way

18:58.770 --> 19:00.380
I was hoping we were gonna get kicked out.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.660
I was being insecure and irrational.

19:05.290 --> 19:07.050
Normally, I'm only one of those things.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.640
And I should've told you about Josh.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.850
It was wrong not to tell you.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.090
I will never keep anything from you again.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.790
Neither will I, which is why...

19:17.600 --> 19:19.330
Gabi, there's something I need to tell you.

19:19.330 --> 19:20.910
There's something I need to tell you, too.

19:20.990 --> 19:21.910
Well, maybe I should go first,

19:21.910 --> 19:23.860
'cause this is really big, and I really want you

19:23.860 --> 19:25.050
to take it in before you react.

19:25.050 --> 19:27.170
- I love you. - What?

19:27.480 --> 19:30.410
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait. I love you.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.300
Now, what did you want to tell me?

19:39.830 --> 19:41.830
That I'm quitting my job in China

19:41.830 --> 19:43.360
and moving back to be with you.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.800
You are?

19:45.620 --> 19:46.950
Yes, of course.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.890
Because I love you, too.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.740
Yes!

19:53.370 --> 19:54.950
I'm really sorry. I was just really nervous,

19:54.950 --> 19:57.140
because I wasn't sure if you were gonna actually say it, too.

20:00.270 --> 20:01.940
- Oh, and I have another secret. - Yeah?

20:01.940 --> 20:04.540
I gave Sofia the hotel room key, so we're alone.

20:04.760 --> 20:05.870
Oh, thank god.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.500
Oh my god.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.250
Oh my god.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.930
Oh my god.

20:28.950 --> 20:30.240
Oh my god.

20:33.070 --> 20:34.640
Oh my god.

20:35.740 --> 20:36.690
Oh my god.

20:36.690 --> 20:37.880
I know. Right?

20:38.830 --> 20:41.040
No, the hotel just sent me the bill.

20:42.820 --> 20:43.940
Oh my god!
