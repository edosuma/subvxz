00:01.074 --> 00:02.589
This is where I saved you
from saved you from ***.

00:02.613 --> 00:04.553
We'll be there
in a couple hours.

00:04.577 --> 00:07.170
Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:07.840 --> 00:10.158
This sanctuary here turned out
too good to be true.

00:10.404 --> 00:11.887
If she's meeting
with the enemy

00:11.911 --> 00:13.374
and she's not telling us about it.

00:13.451 --> 00:15.211
Let's just give her
the benefit of the doubt.

00:15.218 --> 00:15.907
She's earned that.

00:15.931 --> 00:16.434
Okay.

00:16.458 --> 00:17.458
But I'm bringing my guns.

00:17.771 --> 00:19.158
You lied to me, Lexi.

00:19.739 --> 00:21.202
What are your plans
for my daughter?

00:21.502 --> 00:23.728
Soon the transformation
will begin.

00:24.968 --> 00:25.968
Someone let the monk go.

00:26.705 --> 00:27.983
Did you do this?

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

01:06.629 --> 01:08.663
It's Hal.

01:08.665 --> 01:10.465
Shh.

01:19.342 --> 01:21.109
Where were you?

01:27.050 --> 01:28.783
Ben.

01:28.785 --> 01:29.785
Ben?

01:32.354 --> 01:33.688
I'm -- I'm up.
Come in.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.257
How are you feeling?

01:36.259 --> 01:37.692
I wanted
to let you sleep,

01:37.694 --> 01:40.395
but Anne convinced me
I should get you.

01:40.397 --> 01:41.996
I'm fine.
What's wrong?

01:41.998 --> 01:44.132
The Overlord
she was interrogating escaped.

01:44.134 --> 01:46.200
What? No, Anthony was
guarding him. He was chained.

01:46.202 --> 01:47.335
I think
Lexi let him go.

01:47.337 --> 01:49.437
No.
Lexi was deathly sick.

01:49.439 --> 01:51.439
Well,
we got to get him back.

01:51.441 --> 01:53.608
We're doing
a full perimeter sweep.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.343
We need you.

02:00.482 --> 02:02.116
What's wrong?

02:02.118 --> 02:04.652
They're looking for him.
Should I do something?

02:04.654 --> 02:06.521
They won't find him.

02:06.523 --> 02:08.423
They're so afraid of him.

02:08.425 --> 02:10.358
I think
they're afraid of <i>me.</i>

02:10.360 --> 02:12.226
It doesn't matter
what they think.

02:12.228 --> 02:14.328
Maggie's with them.

02:14.330 --> 02:16.597
She used to believe in me,
but now...

02:16.599 --> 02:18.299
Everything's changing.

02:18.301 --> 02:21.102
<i>I</i> haven't changed.
I never will.

02:21.104 --> 02:23.271
Humans talk so much
about change,

02:23.273 --> 02:24.739
but they're afraid of it.

02:24.741 --> 02:26.307
Why?

02:26.309 --> 02:28.176
We're weak,
afraid of the unknown.

02:28.178 --> 02:29.811
Don't be afraid.

02:29.813 --> 02:31.612
My father is returning.

02:31.614 --> 02:33.214
I need to be ready.

02:33.216 --> 02:35.516
Tom's coming here?

02:39.121 --> 02:40.354
I'd like to be alone.

03:18.161 --> 03:20.528
No skitters, no mechs.

03:20.530 --> 03:23.664
You sound surprised.

03:23.666 --> 03:26.267
Even after what
the mech hard drive confirmed.

03:26.269 --> 03:27.635
Yeah.

03:27.637 --> 03:29.837
Doesn't make any sense.

03:29.839 --> 03:32.373
Why would the Espheni
leave this place alone?

03:36.378 --> 03:37.778
Hey, did you see that?

03:37.780 --> 03:39.847
No, no, no.
Right there at the moon.

03:39.849 --> 03:41.349
Right here.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.550
I don't see anything.

03:44.119 --> 03:45.419
Yeah, keep looking.

03:45.421 --> 03:47.188
Drop your weapon!

03:50.292 --> 03:51.692
We don't want
any trouble.

03:51.694 --> 03:53.160
We're looking for
Lourdes Delgado.

03:53.162 --> 03:54.695
We heard
this is a place of safety.

03:54.697 --> 03:57.231
We heard on the radio.
I said, "drop your weapon."

03:57.233 --> 03:58.666
Why don't you
drop <i> your</i> weapon?

04:00.236 --> 04:02.770
Drop 'em.
I'm not gonna say it again.

04:04.473 --> 04:06.440
Dad!

04:09.611 --> 04:11.345
Matt?

04:11.347 --> 04:12.847
Matt!

04:15.450 --> 04:16.851
Good to see you Tom.

04:16.853 --> 04:18.351
You got him.

04:18.353 --> 04:19.853
Wow.

04:19.856 --> 04:22.223
You got my message, too.
I know you said to stay put.

04:22.225 --> 04:24.458
Aliens were on us.
We had to get out of there.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.860
No, you did
the right thing.

04:25.862 --> 04:27.194
Agreed.
Very impressive, soldier.

04:27.196 --> 04:28.863
Hal?

04:28.865 --> 04:30.398
Dad?!
Ben?

04:30.400 --> 04:31.632
Dad!

04:33.535 --> 04:35.703
Where have you been?

04:35.705 --> 04:37.538
How did you...

04:37.540 --> 04:39.173
Long story.

04:39.175 --> 04:40.541
What is this place?

04:40.543 --> 04:42.643
Longer story.

04:45.213 --> 04:47.214
Matt.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.718
You look unbelievable.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.387
You look awful.

05:07.502 --> 05:08.703
Lexi?

05:08.705 --> 05:10.805
She's here.

05:10.807 --> 05:13.507
She's...changed.

05:15.577 --> 05:18.346
I think
we should talk alone.

05:26.421 --> 05:28.856
I brought you some tea.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.960
Oh.

05:59.962 --> 06:02.496
Here's one
for inquiring minds.

06:02.498 --> 06:05.499
How the hell
did this happen?

06:05.501 --> 06:07.768
Lexi happened.

06:07.770 --> 06:10.103
Baby Mason?
Took down a mech?

06:10.105 --> 06:12.039
What is she -- Zeus?

06:12.041 --> 06:13.974
Sort of.

06:13.976 --> 06:16.810
She's not a baby
anymore.

06:20.014 --> 06:21.048
Welcome

06:23.584 --> 06:27.187
please --
have one of these.

06:27.722 --> 06:28.722
Oh. Would you like one?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.063
Hey, Tec.

06:36.065 --> 06:38.031
Huh?

06:38.033 --> 06:39.866
Christmas!

06:39.868 --> 06:43.036
Hey, hey, hey, hey! They're starving --
like we used to be.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.680
It's beautiful here.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.051
I've missed this.

06:58.053 --> 07:00.854
I've missed <i>you.</i>

07:07.061 --> 07:10.864
I've missed you, too.

07:10.866 --> 07:13.834
I've needed you.

07:13.836 --> 07:16.036
It took me months
to find Lexi.

07:16.038 --> 07:18.605
And now that I found her...

07:18.607 --> 07:20.874
I'm here.

07:20.876 --> 07:24.177
You're not alone anymore.

07:24.179 --> 07:27.080
You <i>are</i> starting
to scare me a little bit.

07:27.082 --> 07:29.483
What aren't you telling me
about Lexi?

07:31.018 --> 07:32.119
She's...

07:32.121 --> 07:34.888
Tom! You're here!

07:34.890 --> 07:37.023
Lexi said you would be here,
and you <i>are!</i>

07:37.025 --> 07:40.093
It's really good
to see you.

07:40.095 --> 07:41.962
I'm glad you're okay.

07:41.964 --> 07:43.196
Is Lexi inside?

07:43.198 --> 07:45.966
Yes,
but you won't believe it.

07:45.968 --> 07:48.001
Something wonderful
is happening.

07:53.107 --> 07:54.508
Lexi?

07:55.877 --> 07:57.144
Lexi?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.980
Lexi.
I don't understand.

07:59.982 --> 08:02.549
Oh, my God. I-is that --
it can't be.

08:02.551 --> 08:03.517
Yes.
That's Lexi.

08:03.519 --> 08:04.651
Can't be.

08:04.653 --> 08:07.721
What is this?!
What happened?!

08:07.723 --> 08:10.157
I-I don't know, but -- but she
said we shouldn't be afraid.

08:10.159 --> 08:11.558
We have to let her be.

08:12.627 --> 08:14.161
Anne! Anne!
No, no, no, no! Wait!

08:14.163 --> 08:16.129
We have to get her out of there!
We will!

08:16.131 --> 08:18.098
But not until we figure out what
this is and what it's doing to her.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.534
I don't care what it's doing!
You <i>have</i> to care.

08:20.536 --> 08:22.102
What if it's like
Ben and the harness?

08:22.104 --> 08:23.770
You don't think I wanted
to rip that thing off his back

08:23.772 --> 08:24.838
the second I saw it?

08:24.840 --> 08:25.972
It would have killed him.

08:25.974 --> 08:27.874
Look at her.
She's not in any pain.

08:27.876 --> 08:29.476
She's breathing. She's all right.
She's not okay, Tom!

08:29.478 --> 08:31.178
She's been meeting
with an Espheni Overlord.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.013
She thinks
he's her father.

08:33.015 --> 08:34.214
What?

08:34.216 --> 08:36.515
We captured him,
but then he escaped.

08:36.518 --> 08:38.485
He's been feeding her
all these lies.

08:38.486 --> 08:40.220
What does he want
with her?

08:40.222 --> 08:42.823
I don't know. All he would say
is that he's protecting her.

08:42.825 --> 08:44.858
But he's behind this.I know it.
We have to get her out of here!

08:44.860 --> 08:47.561
We will! But we're gonna do it
the right way!

08:50.031 --> 08:51.231
I promise.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.138
Lexi...

09:02.109 --> 09:05.045
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a girl named Maggie.

09:05.047 --> 09:06.279
Do you know her?

09:06.281 --> 09:07.281
Hal!

09:25.701 --> 09:28.268
God, I missed you.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.839
Look, I know
things were weird between us

09:32.841 --> 09:34.808
when the walls came down,
but I want you back.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.943
Shut up, Hal. Shut up.

09:47.889 --> 09:50.857
Uh, Dad's looking for us.

09:53.561 --> 09:54.561
All right.

09:54.563 --> 09:56.596
We better go.

10:01.903 --> 10:05.005
I don't get it. How --
I mean, h-how is that Lexi?

10:05.007 --> 10:07.040
Looks like
she's some sort of insect.

10:07.042 --> 10:09.809
When Dr. Glass
first brought me

10:09.811 --> 10:11.278
Lexi's DNA sample
back in Charleston,

10:11.280 --> 10:14.014
I discovered she had
both human and Espheni DNA.

10:14.016 --> 10:18.018
Somehow, the alien DNA
remained...inactive.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.921
Think
caterpillar and butterfly.

10:20.923 --> 10:23.690
They're born with all the DNA
necessary to create both insects,

10:23.692 --> 10:25.892
but the butterfly DNA
remains inactive.

10:25.894 --> 10:28.895
Slowly, it...activates,

10:28.897 --> 10:30.897
encourages
the caterpillar to...

10:30.899 --> 10:33.767
Create
and enter a chrysalis.

10:33.769 --> 10:37.170
Once inside, the butterfly DNA
fully activates.

10:37.172 --> 10:41.308
And when the cocoon opens,
uh...the butterfly emerges.

10:41.310 --> 10:42.742
What happens
to the caterpillar?

10:42.744 --> 10:44.711
It's...gone.

10:44.713 --> 10:48.181
So...Lexi's gone?

10:48.183 --> 10:51.685
I -- all I'm saying
is you can't cut a caterpillar

10:51.687 --> 10:53.687
out of its chrysalis
without killing it.

10:53.689 --> 10:55.722
Do the Volm know anything
about these cocoons,

10:55.724 --> 10:56.990
how to get her out?

10:56.992 --> 10:58.858
They're
an Espheni creation.

10:58.860 --> 11:01.861
But we've never attempted
to get one out alive.

11:01.863 --> 11:03.830
Wait a minute.
S-she's not an Espheni.

11:03.832 --> 11:05.098
As you say.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.400
If you know anything...
You have to tell us.

11:07.402 --> 11:09.135
I have
nothing more to share.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.405
I'm sorry.

11:12.407 --> 11:14.808
I must return to my men.

11:17.278 --> 11:19.279
I've seen one of these
before.

11:19.281 --> 11:21.414
In the Espheni tower,
Karen had you and Lexi

11:21.416 --> 11:23.483
in something
very similar to this.

11:23.485 --> 11:24.751
Do you remember
how you got out?

11:24.753 --> 11:26.186
No.

11:26.188 --> 11:29.222
But I <i>have</i> been
having dreams about Karen --

11:29.224 --> 11:31.291
memories, I think.

11:31.293 --> 11:33.159
I might be able
to try something.

11:33.161 --> 11:34.961
Repressed-memory therapy.

11:34.963 --> 11:37.163
With the right medication,
under the right circumstances,

11:37.165 --> 11:39.132
it can be effective.
I don't know.

11:39.134 --> 11:43.236
Somehow, you got out of that cocoon alive,
intact, and human.

11:43.238 --> 11:45.872
If this will help you
remember how you did it...

11:49.110 --> 11:50.310
Okay.

11:51.412 --> 11:52.812
I'll get you set up
in my lab.

11:57.418 --> 11:59.085
We should
keep this between us.

11:59.087 --> 12:01.087
People are already nervous
about Lexi.

12:01.089 --> 12:02.355
Things could get ugly
if they find out.

12:02.357 --> 12:04.057
People have the right
to know.

12:04.059 --> 12:06.793
What if she's turning into
something dangerous?

12:06.795 --> 12:08.495
What if she's like...
Karen.

12:08.497 --> 12:10.930
She's not.
We can't jump to conclusions.

12:10.932 --> 12:13.199
We need to give dad and Anne
a chance to help her.

12:14.502 --> 12:17.070
<i>If</i> they can help.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.441
Where'd you get
all this stuff?

12:21.443 --> 12:24.177
There was a pharmacy
in one of the offices.

12:24.179 --> 12:26.846
I had to dig through rubble
for days,

12:26.848 --> 12:28.882
but now
I'm quite stocked.

12:28.884 --> 12:31.317
Got some vintage Dilaudid,
if anyone's interested.

12:33.788 --> 12:35.288
Anyway...

12:35.290 --> 12:39.125
So, this is
a barbiturate derivative.

12:39.127 --> 12:41.227
It's part hypnotic,
part sedative.

12:41.229 --> 12:43.163
It's not sodium Amytal,
but it'll do.

12:43.165 --> 12:45.198
How much are you
giving me -- 6 cc?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.534
No -- 3.
You're sleep-deprived.

12:47.536 --> 12:50.837
That's probably why
you're having the dreams.

12:50.839 --> 12:53.206
If I give you too much,
you might not wake up.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.484
All right.
You comfortable?

13:04.486 --> 13:05.486
Mm-hmm.

13:05.487 --> 13:06.519
Okay.

13:08.823 --> 13:13.209
Now try to remember the time
that you were with your child,

13:13.211 --> 13:17.547
where you were,
what was around you...

13:17.549 --> 13:20.083
<i>Any sounds...</i>

13:20.085 --> 13:22.552
<i>Any sensations at all</i>
<i>that you remember.</i>

13:22.554 --> 13:24.954
"Peter was not quite
like the other boys,

13:24.956 --> 13:27.257
"but he was afraid
at last.

13:27.259 --> 13:31.161
"A tremor ran through him like
a shudder passing over the sea.

13:31.163 --> 13:34.264
"But the next moment, Peter was
standing on the rock again,

13:34.266 --> 13:38.268
"with a smile on his face
and a drum beating within him.

13:38.270 --> 13:42.906
It was saying, 'to die will be
an awfully big adventure.'"

13:44.241 --> 13:45.942
No. Don't stop.

13:45.944 --> 13:48.912
He has to fight Captain Hook
and fly away and --

13:48.914 --> 13:50.980
Tomorrow, okay? I'll read it
to you in the morning.

13:50.982 --> 13:52.348
But you need
to get some sleep.

13:52.350 --> 13:53.350
Okay.

13:53.351 --> 13:56.085
Can I have some water?

14:09.434 --> 14:11.034
Mommy!
What is that?

14:11.036 --> 14:12.902
Sammy!

14:12.904 --> 14:15.004
Sammy! No!

14:18.103 --> 14:22.631
You told me
to remember my child.

14:23.021 --> 14:24.988
I assumed you meant Lexi,
but that's not --

14:24.990 --> 14:27.257
The process is unpredictable.
Oh, God.

14:27.259 --> 14:30.426
But anything you encounter
that's painful, don't fight it.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.195
It could be the key
to what you're trying to find.

14:32.197 --> 14:34.230
No. No.
This was a bad idea.

14:34.232 --> 14:36.733
Your instincts were right the first time.
I'm going back under.

14:36.735 --> 14:38.234
I don't think
that you should.

14:38.236 --> 14:40.436
Then you --
then you can leave.

14:41.372 --> 14:43.239
It was working, Tom.

14:43.241 --> 14:46.176
It was real,
like my memories of Karen.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.144
My subconscious
has held on to <i>everything.</i>

14:48.146 --> 14:50.046
You woke up
yelling Sammy's name.

14:50.981 --> 14:52.982
When you told me
to remember my child,

14:52.984 --> 14:55.118
my first thought
was of Sammy.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.054
I saw
our last moments together.

14:58.056 --> 14:59.923
It was awful.

15:01.259 --> 15:03.193
But it made me
want to do this even more.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.894
I couldn't save him.

15:04.896 --> 15:06.429
I'm going to save <i>her.</i>

15:07.999 --> 15:10.066
I need 6 cc.

15:12.236 --> 15:14.804
Why are you
looking at him?

15:17.241 --> 15:19.809
Dr. Glass.

15:19.811 --> 15:21.811
I am only going to
think about Lexi.

15:21.813 --> 15:23.313
Dr. Glass
you heard what he said.

15:23.315 --> 15:25.315
If he gives you too much,
you might not wake up.

15:25.317 --> 15:26.850
Anne.
What are you doing?

15:26.852 --> 15:27.951
What are you doing?

15:30.789 --> 15:32.388
Dr. Glass.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.790
What are you doing?

15:34.325 --> 15:36.192
Hey. Don't. Don't!

15:39.897 --> 15:41.831
Tom...

15:41.833 --> 15:43.833
There's nothing really
that you can do here.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.768
I will take care of her.

15:47.371 --> 15:49.806
Fine. I will check on Lexi.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.284
Hey.

16:05.356 --> 16:06.990
You heard.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.059
I'm sorry.
I wanted to be the one.

16:10.061 --> 16:12.528
I was...
I was gonna tell you.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.530
No apology.
Ben told me.

16:14.532 --> 16:15.899
How you holding up?

16:20.271 --> 16:23.439
You know, I was...

16:23.441 --> 16:26.009
...always afraid
to have a daughter.

16:28.012 --> 16:30.513
I couldn't imagine...

16:30.515 --> 16:34.284
Princesses and tea parties...
Boyfriends.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.452
Well, you know,
it's not so bad,

16:36.454 --> 16:40.223
the...Tiaras,
the tea parties.

16:45.329 --> 16:47.563
I guess
we skipped that phase.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.001
We skipped
a <i>lot</i> of phases.

16:52.003 --> 16:54.871
And now here she is,
fully grown.

16:54.873 --> 16:57.540
I barely know her.

16:59.877 --> 17:01.411
And I know

17:01.413 --> 17:04.380
that if she poses any kind
of threat to our survival,

17:04.382 --> 17:06.249
I should be doing
everything in my power

17:06.251 --> 17:08.184
to protect us from her.

17:13.589 --> 17:16.592
But all I want to do
is protect <i>her.</i>

17:16.594 --> 17:20.930
No matter how old she is,
no matter what she looks like,

17:20.932 --> 17:24.067
she'll always be
your little girl.

17:24.069 --> 17:27.136
We're gonna
get her out of here.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.978
We're gonna
get you out of there.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.513
You hear me?
We're gonna get you out.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.282
Aaaa-ow!

17:39.284 --> 17:40.550
What happened?

17:40.552 --> 17:44.287
It's a littler warmer
than I expected.

17:44.289 --> 17:45.989
Dad.

17:45.991 --> 17:47.857
Got some people
looking into ammo and supplies.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.659
Should be rested
and ready to roll in 24 hours.

17:49.661 --> 17:52.862
What's the plan?

17:54.532 --> 17:57.166
What happened to you?

17:57.168 --> 17:58.634
Huh?

17:58.636 --> 18:00.336
Nothing.

18:00.338 --> 18:02.338
Plan's the same
as it always was.

18:02.340 --> 18:04.340
I'm gonna get your sister
out of the woods,

18:04.342 --> 18:05.942
and we're gonna find out where they're
making these human skitters.

18:05.944 --> 18:08.911
And we're gonna shut down
their entire operation.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.347
All right. I think we ought to
hit them at the source.

18:11.349 --> 18:13.583
Find the closest ghetto,
cut the tether,

18:13.585 --> 18:14.984
set the people free.

18:14.986 --> 18:16.619
Then we take
their best fighters

18:16.621 --> 18:18.688
and on and on and on.

18:18.690 --> 18:22.191
I mean, if it's true that they
really are skitterizing adults

18:22.193 --> 18:24.193
and using us as weapons in
a war against some other enemy,

18:24.195 --> 18:26.062
then we hurt them
in two ways.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.230
We strengthen our numbers

18:27.232 --> 18:29.298
while we deplete theirs.

18:35.506 --> 18:38.374
Yeah, that makes sense.

18:38.376 --> 18:41.511
Yeah, we'll do that.
We'll do all that.

18:41.513 --> 18:43.980
Stop them from making
more human skitters,

18:43.982 --> 18:47.216
liberate ghettos, rescue
the kids from Matt's camp.

18:47.218 --> 18:49.452
But not today.

18:49.454 --> 18:52.021
I just got my family back
in one place, in one piece.

18:52.023 --> 18:53.623
I'm not going anywhere.

18:55.059 --> 18:57.193
What should I tell
the people?

18:57.195 --> 18:59.228
Take a breather?

18:59.230 --> 19:02.031
Pretend like we're not facing
the extinction of humankind?

19:02.033 --> 19:03.566
Hey. What's the matter
with you, Hal?

19:05.102 --> 19:07.036
You can tell them
whatever you want.

19:08.439 --> 19:11.641
I've given <i>everything</i>
to these people.

19:11.643 --> 19:13.476
And to this fight.

19:15.579 --> 19:18.181
Today, I'm gonna be here
for my daughter.

19:28.358 --> 19:30.460
I'll admit
the comfy vibe around here

19:30.462 --> 19:33.162
is a hell of a temptation
after years of war.

19:33.164 --> 19:34.931
But it's a lie.

19:34.933 --> 19:36.265
And I hate saying this,

19:36.267 --> 19:38.968
because I'd kill
for Tom and Anne,

19:38.970 --> 19:41.571
but that lie has been coming
from their daughter.

19:41.573 --> 19:45.274
A lot of people here think
Lexi's some kind of savior.

19:45.276 --> 19:46.509
She's not.

19:46.511 --> 19:49.645
Lexi's developing these...

19:49.647 --> 19:51.314
these powers.

19:51.316 --> 19:54.350
And she is a threat
to everyone.

19:54.352 --> 19:56.752
If we want to survive,
we've got to do something.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.690
Hal.

20:08.566 --> 20:10.700
Well, go on.

20:10.702 --> 20:12.802
I want to know
the truth.

20:15.305 --> 20:17.773
Why is she a threat?
What are these powers?

20:21.246 --> 20:25.715
Whenever she gets angry
or frightened...

20:25.717 --> 20:28.184
It's like she's got command
of the heavens.

20:28.186 --> 20:31.220
At first,
it seemed involuntary,

20:31.222 --> 20:33.589
but she's
getting the hang of it now,

20:33.591 --> 20:35.591
and that is probably because

20:35.593 --> 20:37.326
she has been meeting
with an Espheni.

20:37.328 --> 20:39.395
Oh, hold up, now.

20:39.397 --> 20:42.231
An Overlord has been here,
and Lexi's been meeting with it?

20:42.233 --> 20:44.400
We captured him.

20:44.402 --> 20:45.835
But he escaped.

20:45.837 --> 20:49.672
I know
Lexi helped him get away.

20:49.674 --> 20:51.774
You know,
if we had any sense,

20:51.776 --> 20:53.643
we would
Jack Ruby her ass

20:53.645 --> 20:55.444
And eliminate any threat altogether!

20:55.446 --> 20:56.679
Well, what's all this?

21:04.721 --> 21:06.489
What did you just say?

21:06.491 --> 21:10.226
I said...
What we're all thinking, Tom.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.762
Your daughter --
she's a liability.

21:12.764 --> 21:15.364
So that's what you're doing
out here in the dark?

21:15.366 --> 21:18.167
You're working on a plot...
to kill her?

21:21.405 --> 21:23.206
What's the matter?
I don't get a vote?

21:24.508 --> 21:26.242
I don't get a say?

21:27.644 --> 21:29.378
Maybe it's because
you don't think I'm capable

21:29.380 --> 21:31.247
of having an unbiased
conversation about her.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.648
No, sir, I do not.

21:32.650 --> 21:36.152
It's what you might call
a conflict of interest.

21:37.387 --> 21:40.590
When have I ever shied away
from making a tough call?

21:42.893 --> 21:47.597
I'm not blind to the situation,
the risk she poses.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.498
The truth is,
we don't know <i>what</i> Lexi is

21:49.500 --> 21:51.367
or what she's becoming,

21:51.369 --> 21:54.337
and no one's gonna touch her
until we get more information!

21:58.775 --> 22:00.576
And I would say
the same thing

22:00.578 --> 22:02.878
if it was any of you
in the cocoon, and you know it!

22:07.584 --> 22:09.652
No one comes near her.

22:20.764 --> 22:22.665
Dad! Wait.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.433
You know
what I was coming to do?

22:24.435 --> 22:26.502
Apologize to you for
being short with you earlier.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.946
And I come in,
and I see --

22:28.766 --> 22:29.766
I can't even look at you
right now.

22:29.767 --> 22:31.626
We were just talking.
They have valid concerns.

22:31.627 --> 22:32.423
We don't know what's going on
just kill her.

22:32.447 --> 22:33.695
Oh, so we should
with her inside that cocoon.

22:33.696 --> 22:35.429
You saw
what happened to Karen.

22:35.431 --> 22:37.498
They turned a sweet,
sarcastic girl into a monster.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.366
Lexi's not Karen!
We don't know that!

22:39.368 --> 22:41.468
I was furious with you
when you shot Karen.

22:41.470 --> 22:43.303
I was convinced
she could be saved,

22:43.305 --> 22:44.605
that she was gonna
come back to us,

22:44.607 --> 22:46.440
but you knew
that wasn't the case.

22:46.442 --> 22:48.075
The Karen that we knew and loved
was gone,

22:48.077 --> 22:49.810
and you took the shot,
and you made the right call.

22:49.812 --> 22:51.578
She wasn't your sister!

22:51.580 --> 22:53.547
Lexi is a 21-year-old
half-Espheni

22:53.549 --> 22:55.115
who's having secret meetings
with the enemy.

22:55.117 --> 22:56.517
All right, well,
she's still my daughter,

22:56.519 --> 22:58.418
and until we really know
what's going on in there,

22:58.420 --> 23:01.688
nobody comes near her,
especially not <i>you!</i>

23:10.082 --> 23:11.982
Heard you had a meeting
about Lexi.

23:11.984 --> 23:13.684
Yeah.
She's dangerous, Ben.

23:13.686 --> 23:16.153
You're afraid of her. Or maybe
you're just afraid of <i>yourself.</i>

23:16.155 --> 23:17.588
Yeah, that's it.
You got me all figured out.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.223
I-I'm serious.

23:19.225 --> 23:21.392
When I first woke up,
you were -- you were different.

23:21.394 --> 23:23.127
You were happy,
and I think you're afraid

23:23.129 --> 23:25.196
that if Lexi stays around,
you might be happy again.

23:25.198 --> 23:26.964
I wasn't happy.
I was duped.

23:26.966 --> 23:30.601
You told me that you
walked the perimeter every day

23:30.603 --> 23:32.703
looking for a fight,
but there <i>was</i> no fight.

23:32.705 --> 23:35.072
You -- you weren't duped.
That was real.

23:35.074 --> 23:37.274
That wall
you work so hard to keep up,

23:37.276 --> 23:38.976
the one
that keeps everyone away,

23:38.978 --> 23:41.111
you were -- you were peeking out
from behind it

23:41.113 --> 23:42.379
because of her,
because of Lexi.

23:42.381 --> 23:44.148
You were happy.
You were beautiful.

23:48.653 --> 23:51.255
What do you want from me?

23:51.257 --> 23:55.693
I-I want you
to consider another choice.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.995
You -- do you remember
what you told me

23:57.997 --> 23:59.497
when you showed me
the downed mech?

23:59.499 --> 24:01.999
You said
it was a miracle.

24:02.001 --> 24:04.702
You said that afterwards, you
felt like anything was possible.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.704
She's meeting
with an Espheni.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.072
I'm not defending that!

24:08.074 --> 24:09.440
But think about it --
we don't --

24:09.442 --> 24:11.342
we don't know
what those meetings were about.

24:11.344 --> 24:13.177
Maybe she's --
she's manipulating them.

24:13.179 --> 24:14.645
Maybe
she's setting them up.

24:14.647 --> 24:17.081
The point is, before we just
run in there and execute her,

24:17.083 --> 24:19.350
shouldn't we give her the chance
to prove she's on our side --

24:19.352 --> 24:20.451
that she's still
one of us?

24:22.454 --> 24:24.321
I don't know.

24:24.323 --> 24:26.223
Sounds like
wishful thinking.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.760
It's called hope.

24:29.762 --> 24:32.096
<i>That's</i> what I want.

24:32.098 --> 24:33.998
I want you
to choose hope.

24:42.574 --> 24:45.175
I'm sorry, Ben.

25:14.406 --> 25:17.374
Give me my child Karen.

25:17.376 --> 25:20.210
She's beautiful, Anne.

25:20.212 --> 25:22.212
She looks so human.

25:22.214 --> 25:24.381
She <i>is</i> human.

25:24.383 --> 25:28.185
Is that why you ran away
from Charleston, the 2nd Mass?

25:28.187 --> 25:31.088
No.

25:31.090 --> 25:34.391
You ran because you knew
she was different.

25:34.393 --> 25:36.126
She's my flesh and blood.

25:36.128 --> 25:38.128
She's my creation.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.230
And in time,
she'll become just like me.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.534
But better.

25:43.536 --> 25:45.102
Much better.

25:47.072 --> 25:49.340
Together,
we will end this war,

25:49.342 --> 25:51.208
change
the face of history.

25:53.546 --> 25:55.713
I'm her mother.
She needs <i>me.</i>

25:55.715 --> 25:58.248
And that's why
you're still here.

25:58.250 --> 26:03.687
Humans need nurturing
and...attachment at her age.

26:03.689 --> 26:06.690
But soon,
you'll serve your purpose,

26:06.692 --> 26:09.126
and Lexi
will be fully mine.

26:09.128 --> 26:11.795
I will never let you
take her from me.

26:11.797 --> 26:14.531
Do you hear me?
I'm going to save her.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.500
Anne.

26:16.502 --> 26:18.869
You can't save her.

26:18.871 --> 26:21.305
You can't even save
<i>yourself.</i>

26:32.151 --> 26:34.351
Dr. Glass? Dr. Glass?

26:35.821 --> 26:41.291
I saw...Karen and -- and Lexi
in the cocoon.

26:41.293 --> 26:44.561
She -- she said
it was irreversible...

26:44.563 --> 26:46.563
...That there's
nothing we can do.

26:46.565 --> 26:50.200
I
I couldn't save Sammy.

26:50.202 --> 26:52.169
I can't save her.

26:52.171 --> 26:53.237
Dr. Glass.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.541
Dr. Glass,
can you hear me?

27:01.579 --> 27:02.846
Dr. Kadar?

27:04.349 --> 27:07.351
Looks like
the secret's out.

27:07.353 --> 27:10.554
Everyone knows something big's
about to happen.

27:10.556 --> 27:12.756
Lines are being drawn.

27:12.758 --> 27:15.359
I don't want this
turning into a fight.

27:15.361 --> 27:17.261
But I'm not letting anybody
near Lexi.

27:17.263 --> 27:20.230
If it comes to a fight,
we're gonna be outnumbered.

27:20.232 --> 27:22.733
So we're gonna need
all the allies we can get.

27:24.636 --> 27:26.403
I'm gonna get
some answers.

27:28.139 --> 27:29.273
Lourdes,
you got a minute?

27:29.275 --> 27:30.441
Yeah.

27:30.443 --> 27:32.910
I need you
to be straight with me.

27:32.912 --> 27:36.346
I'm hearing a lot of
disconcerting things about Lexi.

27:36.348 --> 27:38.515
And I need to know
why <i>you</i> trust her.

27:39.684 --> 27:40.951
What is this all about?

27:40.953 --> 27:42.386
It's about fear.

27:43.688 --> 27:45.155
Do you remember
how I was

27:45.157 --> 27:46.757
after you discovered
I was the mole?

27:46.759 --> 27:47.759
Yeah.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.360
I was consumed by fear.

27:50.362 --> 27:53.630
Lexi made all of that go away.
She saved me.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.566
You've seen
what the enemy can do.

27:55.568 --> 27:57.367
How can you still trust her when
you know she's working with them?

27:57.369 --> 28:00.204
She's not working with them.
She <i>is</i> them.

28:00.206 --> 28:01.805
And she is <i>us.</i>

28:01.807 --> 28:04.341
She's uniting us all.

28:04.343 --> 28:06.577
That's what --
that's what this is.

28:06.579 --> 28:07.644
It's her symbol.

28:07.646 --> 28:10.881
It represents unity --

28:10.883 --> 28:14.384
humans, Espheni,
and Lexi.

28:14.386 --> 28:17.488
She's the one who will
bring us all together.

28:17.490 --> 28:19.356
She is the intersection.

28:19.358 --> 28:21.959
One plus one
equals three.

28:21.961 --> 28:25.362
That's why I sent out
the radio signal.

28:25.364 --> 28:28.265
Once everyone is here,
there will be peace.

28:28.267 --> 28:30.434
You think the Espheni
are gonna honor that peace?

28:30.436 --> 28:33.303
They have so far.
They know we're here.

28:33.305 --> 28:36.673
And they haven't touched us --
all because of Lexi.

28:36.675 --> 28:37.975
You don't believe me.

28:40.245 --> 28:41.545
I don't know.

28:41.547 --> 28:43.514
But I do know
that I'm gonna need your help,

28:43.516 --> 28:45.849
because those people
are afraid of her.

28:45.851 --> 28:48.252
And I'm afraid they're gonna try
to get in here and hurt her.

28:48.254 --> 28:49.820
And we're not
gonna let them in.

28:49.822 --> 28:53.390
No one is
going to hurt Lexi.

28:53.392 --> 28:55.392
I can't wait
for her to come out.

29:00.999 --> 29:03.267
I mean, obviously,
I want to side with my family,

29:03.269 --> 29:05.469
with my dad -- and they think
she can still be saved.

29:05.471 --> 29:06.937
But I'm not gonna be able
to live with myself

29:06.939 --> 29:08.739
if she comes out
of that thing

29:08.741 --> 29:10.974
and she hurts the people
I've been trying to keep safe.

29:10.976 --> 29:14.411
I mean,
<i>they're</i> my family, too.

29:15.848 --> 29:17.548
You're not saying
anything.

29:17.550 --> 29:20.717
You agree
with my dad.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.820
No.

29:22.822 --> 29:25.455
Do you agree with <i>me?</i>

29:25.457 --> 29:27.324
No.

29:27.326 --> 29:29.893
Thanks.
That's very helpful.

29:29.895 --> 29:32.362
I fix broken things,
huh?

29:32.364 --> 29:36.800
Bring me a watch, radiator,
washing machine -- no problem.

29:36.802 --> 29:40.404
People, families...

29:40.406 --> 29:42.339
Cocoons...

29:42.341 --> 29:43.607
Not an expert.

29:43.609 --> 29:45.475
There <i>aren't</i> any experts.

29:45.477 --> 29:47.544
That's not entirely true.

29:47.546 --> 29:49.813
The Volm have some experience
in these matters

29:49.815 --> 29:51.882
you may find
worth considering.

29:51.884 --> 29:54.051
You said you didn't know anything,
that you couldn't help.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.987
I said I didn't know anything
about getting her out <i>alive.</i>

29:58.756 --> 30:00.958
So you <i>do</i> know something.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.427
Worst-case scenario,
what happens?

30:03.429 --> 30:05.562
Worst-case...

30:05.564 --> 30:07.064
She kills you all.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.399
She's one girl.

30:09.401 --> 30:12.402
When Espheni hatchlings
first emerge into the world,

30:12.404 --> 30:14.338
they're at
their most violent,

30:14.340 --> 30:18.742
extremely dangerous,
and unpredictable.

30:18.744 --> 30:20.777
We terminate
<i>any</i> we encounter.

30:22.413 --> 30:25.482
So...
Terminate Lexi?

30:25.484 --> 30:28.485
Years ago, my unit
came across a pod of cocoons,

30:28.487 --> 30:30.020
and they cut one open.

30:30.022 --> 30:32.422
The Espheni inside it
was terminated.

30:32.424 --> 30:34.491
But the other three
sensed danger

30:34.493 --> 30:36.593
and began radiating
intense heat.

30:36.595 --> 30:39.796
You have no idea
what they're capable of.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.665
They attack body and mind.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.700
You cannot stand
against them.

30:45.136 --> 30:47.037
I lost nine brothers
that day.

30:49.674 --> 30:52.876
Engaging her is a risk
I am not willing to take.

30:52.878 --> 30:54.945
We are retreating
to a safe distance.

30:54.947 --> 30:57.848
I suggest
you do the same.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.991
Well?
What'd he say?

31:09.761 --> 31:11.828
That bad, huh?

31:11.830 --> 31:13.997
I got to talk
to my dad.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.465
Guys.

31:15.467 --> 31:16.867
I need
to do this alone.

31:16.869 --> 31:20.270
Oh, yeah.
Nah, we understand.

31:20.272 --> 31:21.672
We'll go with you.

31:30.915 --> 31:33.517
It's going to be
all right.

31:33.519 --> 31:35.986
We're not gonna let anything
happen to your sister.

31:38.056 --> 31:41.825
You really think
Lexi's still in there?

31:41.827 --> 31:43.794
I <i>know</i> she is.

31:45.596 --> 31:47.798
I know she is, Matt.

31:49.133 --> 31:50.534
I know she is.

31:50.536 --> 31:52.903
Jesus.

31:52.905 --> 31:55.238
Why didn't you tell me it was so bad?
It's not so bad.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.240
I got to check on Anne.

31:56.254 --> 31:57.976
I'll see if Kadar's got
anything for that hand.

31:57.977 --> 31:59.476
I don't need
Kadar.

32:02.614 --> 32:04.548
Mason!!

32:08.153 --> 32:10.020
Dad, we have a problem!

32:10.022 --> 32:12.889
Tom Mason!

32:12.891 --> 32:14.658
Dad!

32:15.727 --> 32:17.828
It's Pope and Hal.
They're coming for Lexi.

32:17.830 --> 32:19.262
Mason!!

32:19.264 --> 32:21.598
Join arms!
We can't let them pass!

32:23.768 --> 32:26.803
I know
you're in there, Tom!

32:27.873 --> 32:29.039
Out of the way, Lourdes.

32:29.974 --> 32:32.909
Step aside,
you Espheni-loving little bitch.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.358
Put your weapon down, Pope.
I said get out of the way!

32:34.359 --> 32:35.125
Everybody take it easy.

32:35.149 --> 32:36.614
Don't make this any harder
than it's got to be.

32:36.615 --> 32:37.881
Lower your weapon!
Lourdes!

32:37.883 --> 32:39.783
Lourdes!

32:39.785 --> 32:41.218
Lourdes, we don't want
to hurt anybody,

32:41.220 --> 32:42.919
but you got to
let me through.

32:42.921 --> 32:44.821
You don't want to hurt anybody?
What about Lexi?

32:44.823 --> 32:46.556
Let us in, Mason!
Stay together! Stay strong!

32:46.558 --> 32:48.558
Tom, we're coming in!

32:48.560 --> 32:50.227
That's not gonna happen.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.229
You need
to let me handle this.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.697
Stand down!

32:53.699 --> 32:55.832
Mason!
Stay together! Stay strong!

32:55.834 --> 32:57.567
We got to hash this out,
Mason!

33:13.959 --> 33:16.094
I need you
to be straight with me.

33:16.096 --> 33:17.662
Am I doing
the right thing?

33:19.098 --> 33:21.933
From a military
standpoint...

33:21.935 --> 33:25.870
Lexi's a known threat
that should be eliminated.

33:25.872 --> 33:28.306
But as a father...

33:28.308 --> 33:31.976
I would die before I let
anyone hurt her, Tom.

33:38.917 --> 33:42.687
- Let us in, Mason!
- Stay strong! Stay strong!

33:46.291 --> 33:48.626
Everybody stop!

33:49.929 --> 33:52.196
No one takes
another step.

33:52.198 --> 33:55.199
Dingaan, Tector,
don't let anybody through.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.681
We just want to talk.

34:11.684 --> 34:13.351
You expect me to believe that when
you come in here armed to the teeth?

34:13.353 --> 34:15.386
Well,
I <i> wanted</i> to come alone.

34:15.388 --> 34:18.723
But I remember what you said
when we were leaving the ghetto.

34:18.725 --> 34:21.259
We have to trust each other.
We can't do this alone.

34:21.261 --> 34:23.027
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Enough already.

34:23.029 --> 34:24.962
Look, Mason, the verdict's in
on Lexi, all right?

34:24.964 --> 34:26.397
She chose
to side with the enemy.

34:26.399 --> 34:28.399
We got to take care of her
before it's too late.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.368
She hasn't hurt anyone yet.
She hasn't done a thing.

34:30.370 --> 34:32.203
What about Colonel Weaver's hand?
That was an accident.

34:32.205 --> 34:34.205
Was it an accident
she freed an Espheni Overlord?

34:34.206 --> 34:36.107
When she comes out
and can defend herself,

34:36.109 --> 34:37.375
I'll get
to the bottom of that.

34:37.377 --> 34:39.010
In the meantime,

34:39.012 --> 34:41.212
I'm not gonna let
a permanent decision get made,

34:41.214 --> 34:45.382
especially on the basis
of innuendo or rumor or fear!

34:45.385 --> 34:46.984
Maggie.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.985
Tell him what you told me --
what you've seen.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.860
Come on Mags, tell
him what you told us.

34:55.862 --> 34:57.462
Tell him.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.399
Look.

35:01.401 --> 35:03.367
I'm not afraid to kill.

35:03.369 --> 35:04.869
You know that.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.739
But I try really hard

35:08.741 --> 35:10.542
to make sure I only kill
those who deserve it.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.482
I'm not ready
to say that about Lexi.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.790
Not ready?

35:25.792 --> 35:27.792
Boy you're
something else.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.543
Dad,
I talked to the Volm.

35:45.545 --> 35:46.777
They're leaving.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.147
They're convinced that Lexi is
gonna come out of that thing

35:50.149 --> 35:52.950
more dangerous than
we could have ever imagined.

35:52.952 --> 35:55.019
Now, we got to do <i>something.</i>
We got to leave --

35:55.021 --> 35:56.220
or what -- kill her?

35:58.023 --> 36:00.024
Yes, she could be dangerous.
I accept that.

36:00.026 --> 36:01.526
I accepted that fact
a long time ago.

36:01.528 --> 36:03.461
I need <i>you</i> to accept the fact
that you may not know

36:03.463 --> 36:05.396
every damn thing
going on inside that cocoon.

36:05.398 --> 36:07.265
We know
what she's done!

36:07.267 --> 36:10.001
And, yes, you're right --
she hasn't hurt anybody yet.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.204
Do you remember
a couple of years ago

36:13.206 --> 36:15.473
when you came off
that Espheni ship?

36:15.475 --> 36:18.242
You told me
to keep an eye on you,

36:18.244 --> 36:19.977
and if you did
anything strange,

36:19.979 --> 36:21.879
anything
to endanger the people,

36:21.881 --> 36:26.183
that I needed to stop you
by whatever means necessary.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.085
You wanted
to protect your family.

36:31.924 --> 36:33.457
You guys are my family.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.363
And <i>this...</i>
is my family.

36:41.166 --> 36:44.368
I got to protect them
by whatever means necessary.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.472
Hal.

36:48.474 --> 36:49.974
Do you honestly believe

36:49.976 --> 36:52.109
I would let her hurt
any of us, any of you?

36:52.111 --> 36:53.411
What if
you can't stop her?

36:53.413 --> 36:54.912
I can stop her.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.282
She's my daughter.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.384
She's <i>my</i> responsibility.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.557
I want everybody
out of the courtyard,

37:06.559 --> 37:07.892
out of harm's way.

37:07.894 --> 37:09.160
I'll stay inside
with her.

37:09.162 --> 37:10.394
As will I.

37:10.396 --> 37:11.228
Me too.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.563
And me.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.131
I'm not going anywhere.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.002
If she comes out
and is the monster

37:18.004 --> 37:19.870
you all think she is,
I'll take care of it.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.208
By whatever means
necessary.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.146
Let's get them
out of here.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.050
Come on take care of it.

38:00.213 --> 38:02.913
I couldn't save Sammy.

38:02.915 --> 38:04.348
I can't save Lexi.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.417
Dr. Glass?
Can you hear me?

38:06.419 --> 38:07.451
Dr. Glass!

38:12.157 --> 38:14.191
I couldn't save him.

38:14.193 --> 38:16.394
I can't save her.

38:16.396 --> 38:18.229
There's nothing
we can do.

38:18.231 --> 38:19.897
There's nothing
we can do.

38:19.899 --> 38:21.232
Speak for yourself.

38:21.234 --> 38:23.034
I'm getting you
the hell out of there.

38:23.036 --> 38:24.935
Unh!

38:33.912 --> 38:35.479
Mom?

38:45.168 --> 38:46.335
Oh, God.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.194
How --
how are you --

38:50.196 --> 38:52.196
There isn't time
to explain.

38:52.198 --> 38:53.530
I'm here.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.700
I'm with you,
and I love you.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.703
I'm sorry about Sammy.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.205
I know
you wanted to save him,

39:01.207 --> 39:02.773
just like I know
you want to save <i>me.</i>

39:08.146 --> 39:09.713
Take my hand.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.349
There's something
I need you to see.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.191
What is this?

39:21.193 --> 39:23.227
It's my memory.

39:30.068 --> 39:33.203
Lexi, it's time.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.538
Are you ready to go?

39:34.540 --> 39:36.040
Where are we going?

39:36.042 --> 39:37.641
To your father.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.576
We're going to end
this war.

39:39.578 --> 39:43.047
We're going to bring peace...
to everyone.

39:44.449 --> 39:47.317
You don't need her
anymore.

39:48.286 --> 39:49.319
No.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.563
Why are you
showing me this?

39:59.565 --> 40:02.332
I want you to remember
I needed you -- not Karen.

40:02.334 --> 40:03.667
I chose <i>you.</i>

40:03.669 --> 40:06.437
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere.

40:06.439 --> 40:08.672
As long as you need me,
I'm here.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.841
I'll <i>always</i> need
my family.

40:10.843 --> 40:13.377
I'll always choose
my family.

40:13.379 --> 40:15.245
But you're in the cocoon.

40:15.247 --> 40:16.814
Don't be afraid.

40:16.816 --> 40:20.084
Metamorphosis
is not a bad thing.

40:20.086 --> 40:23.420
But how do I get you out?
How do I save you?

40:23.422 --> 40:25.289
You don't have to save me.

40:25.291 --> 40:28.425
<i>I'm</i> going to save <i>you.</i>

40:31.162 --> 40:32.763
Mommy.

40:32.765 --> 40:34.264
Wake up.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.432
Wake up.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.835
Wake up.

40:40.339 --> 40:41.705
Dr. Glass?

40:44.677 --> 40:46.877
Are you all right?

40:57.289 --> 40:59.156
Tom!

40:59.158 --> 41:00.158
Anne?

41:00.159 --> 41:01.558
Oh, thank God.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.527
Are you all right?
Did you remember anything?

41:03.529 --> 41:06.196
It's not what <i>I</i> remembered.
It's what <i>Lexi</i> remembered.

41:06.198 --> 41:09.466
She showed me her memory from when
we were both in the Espheni tower.

41:09.468 --> 41:12.503
She needed me then,
and she needs me <i>now.</i>

41:13.906 --> 41:15.906
She's not
going to hurt us.

41:15.908 --> 41:18.275
Okay.
So...we wait.

41:18.277 --> 41:20.944
She'll come out
when she's ready.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.747
And we'll be ready
for <i>her.</i>

41:23.749 --> 41:25.182
Anne.

41:25.184 --> 41:26.483
No, it's too hot!

41:26.485 --> 41:28.318
It's okay.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.621
She knows
I'm not a threat.

41:35.693 --> 41:37.361
Lexi.

41:37.363 --> 41:38.729
It's me.

41:38.731 --> 41:40.898
I'm here.
I heard you.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.901
I'm not going anywhere.
