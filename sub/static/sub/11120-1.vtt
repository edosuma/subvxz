04:54.079 --> 04:56.566
- Why are you late?
- My Rolls got towed away.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.905
Don't play, we've got people here.

04:59.103 --> 05:02.005
lf l gave you $1,000,000
would you be mad at me?

05:02.206 --> 05:04.345
- Sure!
- You would?

05:05.247 --> 05:08.662
Still? That's a beautiful dress
you've got on.

05:08.863 --> 05:11.580
lt is. You know, l can see them...
Sexy.

05:13.663 --> 05:17.787
How about a quarter, as
a down payment on that $1,000,000?

05:17.983 --> 05:21.365
Think l won't keep it?
l will keep it. Believe that.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.349
l know you will take it.

05:24.894 --> 05:26.967
There you go.
One, two, three...

05:29.023 --> 05:33.180
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

05:33.374 --> 05:36.670
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

05:37.599 --> 05:41.396

OK, once again.
Five, six, seven, eight!

05:45.406 --> 05:49.978
Look in the mirrors at yourselves.
You got attitude. You got strength.

05:50.175 --> 05:53.208
Attitude, come on...
Molly, watch your line.

05:54.175 --> 05:57.470
Be proud! You're dancers.
You love dancing.

05:57.663 --> 06:02.682
That's it. We've got potential here.
We've got real potential.

06:17.407 --> 06:20.057
Any messages?

06:48.414 --> 06:50.422
Any messages?

07:16.223 --> 07:19.289
- Hey, Tony, how's your love life?
- All right.

07:19.486 --> 07:23.261
- You know why l order so many drinks?
- You're an alcoholic.

07:23.455 --> 07:25.844
No.
Because l love to watch your walk.

07:26.431 --> 07:30.522
- Oooh, oooh! l like that!
- Great walk.

07:41.118 --> 07:44.697
How are you, Margaret?
Freddie, where's my order?

07:44.894 --> 07:48.506
Coming up.
Some of your groupie friends are here.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.775
- Who?
- Those friends of yours.

07:52.734 --> 07:57.012
- They're acquaintances.
- How about sharing the wealth?

07:57.215 --> 08:00.510
- Am l your booking agent?
- You don't want to share?

08:00.703 --> 08:02.874
l don't need your hand-me-downs.

08:03.038 --> 08:07.381
- Have you got emotional problems?
- You think l need a shrink?

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
- How late are you working tonight?
- Till three.

08:19.903 --> 08:23.700
- Want to come over?
- Last time, l almost got brain damage.

08:23.902 --> 08:27.066
You party too hard.
You ought to be a tag team.

08:27.519 --> 08:29.853
Good guys are hard to find.

08:30.559 --> 08:33.111
Why don't you try the army?

08:58.399 --> 09:01.148
- Are we on later?
- No, l can't make it.

09:01.342 --> 09:03.284
Why not?

09:03.487 --> 09:07.709
- Lately, l've been career oriented.
- What's that mean?

09:07.903 --> 09:11.252
l don't have time for relationships
right now.

09:11.454 --> 09:13.309
That right?

09:13.503 --> 09:15.739
Well, let me tell you something.

09:15.935 --> 09:20.408
Guys like you aren't relationships,
you're exercise.

09:33.022 --> 09:38.139
- Why do you have to go? lt's only six.
- l want to get something going today.

09:38.334 --> 09:42.589
- Don't you want to stay for breakfast?
- No, l'm not hungry.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.117
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

09:45.279 --> 09:48.061
l just want to get something
going today.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.124
- You will.
- l'll see you later.

09:51.326 --> 09:55.418
- l'll miss you.
- You don't have to say that, Jackie.

09:55.614 --> 09:57.589
l know l don't.

10:17.790 --> 10:22.100
l'm a dancer by nature. l studied
for four years and now l teach.

10:22.302 --> 10:25.204
- But l'm very available for TV work.
- No.

10:26.654 --> 10:28.181
Good day.

10:28.383 --> 10:32.725
Acting roles... l do dramatic parts.
l can do comedy roles.

10:32.927 --> 10:35.414
l'd consider doing a soap opera

10:35.615 --> 10:38.582
or even a roadshow,
a musical of some sort.

10:38.782 --> 10:41.368
l would consider
doing a print ad.

10:41.567 --> 10:45.942
lf you're looking for the outdoor type,
l'm good at some sports,

10:46.142 --> 10:49.077
like weightlifting and stickball

10:49.278 --> 10:51.133
and push-ups, and...

10:51.327 --> 10:56.149
lf absolutely necessary, l don't mind
doing any kind of extra work.

10:56.319 --> 11:00.279
Except l promised my mother
l'd never do any nudity.

11:00.510 --> 11:04.089
l guess she's afraid
that l might get a cold.

11:04.286 --> 11:07.286
But the fact still is,
l'm a dancer by nature.

11:08.190 --> 11:10.133
Whatever.

11:11.294 --> 11:13.236
Yeah, whatever.

11:18.974 --> 11:21.341
lt's like you're invisible.

11:21.535 --> 11:25.015
They make you feel
like you're wasting your time.

11:25.214 --> 11:29.404
What's really weird is that
they all sound like my father used to.

11:29.983 --> 11:32.765
Why be down on yourself?
You know what you can do.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.097
- What about you?
- What about me?

11:35.294 --> 11:38.261
You've been doing choruses
for six years.

11:38.463 --> 11:41.397
Don't you want to do something
that's all you?

11:41.599 --> 11:45.854
- lf it happens, good. lf not, too bad.
- How could you think that way?

11:46.047 --> 11:49.243
A woman's dancing career
is half as long as a man's.

11:49.470 --> 11:52.405
So l have half as many chances
as you of making it.

11:52.606 --> 11:57.047
- l've got to be real with myself.
- l don't know, l guess so.

11:58.590 --> 12:00.532
Mm... cherry.

12:00.734 --> 12:03.418
- See you later.
- Will you come tonight?

12:03.614 --> 12:06.811
- lt's the last show.
- l don't think l can make it.

12:07.006 --> 12:09.625
- Why the excuses?
- What excuses?

12:09.822 --> 12:12.375
Don't play this competition thing
with me.

12:13.054 --> 12:17.145
Just because you're in a show
and l'm not, that ain't competition.

12:17.342 --> 12:19.481
- Well, what is it?
- Envy!

12:20.062 --> 12:22.069
Will you be there?

12:42.814 --> 12:44.756
Got any messages?

12:44.959 --> 12:46.933
lt's an inside joke.

15:32.478 --> 15:36.056
- Tony!
- Hey, Jackie! You were great!

15:36.254 --> 15:40.444
- Are you sure?
- l'm positive. You was fantastic.

15:40.638 --> 15:45.210
- l was nervous knowing you were here.
- You shouldn't have been.

15:45.406 --> 15:47.861
- Are you sure l was OK?
- You were great.

15:48.062 --> 15:50.812
- l'll change. Will you wait?
- Yeah.

15:51.006 --> 15:54.267
- l'll meet you outside.
- Sure, why not?

16:19.806 --> 16:21.780
Hi.

16:23.070 --> 16:24.859
Yes?

16:25.054 --> 16:28.502
l wanted to tell you
l think you're an incredible dancer.

16:28.702 --> 16:30.840
Thank you very much.

16:31.326 --> 16:34.424
l'm a friend of Jackie Coll's.
Tony Manero.

16:34.622 --> 16:39.707
- lt's important to have friends.
- l was saying that over breakfast.

16:41.566 --> 16:45.211
Did you want something?
An autograph, or something?

16:45.406 --> 16:49.684
l'd like to get together and talk
some time. Would that be possible?

16:49.886 --> 16:53.334
- About what?
- About how incredible you are.

16:53.886 --> 16:57.235
- Thank you, but l already know that.
- Say what?

16:58.014 --> 16:59.988
l already know.

17:02.014 --> 17:05.691
l used to be incredible myself
when l lived in Brooklyn.

17:06.013 --> 17:09.462
- Really? What happened?
- l moved to Manhattan.

17:14.654 --> 17:19.575
So, where exactly are you imported
from? The vicinity of England?

17:20.478 --> 17:23.413
- Very good.
- See? l know.

17:25.086 --> 17:28.860
- So what do you do?
- l'm sort of into telling the future.

17:30.782 --> 17:35.572
- Great things will happen for you.
- Oh, really? What great things?

17:36.990 --> 17:42.140
You're going to meet this really,
really sensitive, nice type of guy.

17:42.334 --> 17:46.109
Once you get to know him,
you're going to be crazy about him.

17:46.302 --> 17:47.993
- l am?
- Yeah!

17:48.158 --> 17:50.133
So where is he?

17:50.334 --> 17:54.775
l'll go get him. You just wait here.
You'll love him. He's great.

17:54.974 --> 17:59.513
Hey, Rico! She's waiting to see you.
Really! Come on, she's great!

17:59.678 --> 18:01.653
Really!
No, l'll get him.

18:01.854 --> 18:05.564
l got her here. She's nice.
No problem. You'll love her.

18:05.790 --> 18:08.059
Come on...
Wait! Well, come on.

18:17.502 --> 18:20.666
- lt didn't happen.
- lmported, indeed!

18:25.470 --> 18:29.398
- How are you doing?
- Strong draught in there, huh?

18:34.334 --> 18:38.131
- Come in.
- You nearly broke my face with the door.

18:38.334 --> 18:42.589
l'm giving you my best come-ons
and you try to mangle my face.

18:42.782 --> 18:45.684
- Well, Jimmy, you see...
- Tony!

18:45.886 --> 18:51.636
Whatever. You seem to take pleasure
in treating women as incredibly stupid.

18:51.870 --> 18:56.442
lf you're mad at me, l apologise.
l thought l was being charming.

18:56.670 --> 19:00.598
You did try to damage my head.
But the thing is that l...

19:00.798 --> 19:04.540
l amazingly respect your dancing
talent. And your womanhood.

19:04.734 --> 19:08.050
l didn't always respect womanhood,
but since l moved to Manhattan,

19:08.254 --> 19:13.524
l got this new, mature outlook. l don't
smoke, l don't drink, l don't curse.

19:13.726 --> 19:16.443
Anyway, l would like to take you out.

19:16.638 --> 19:20.664
Maybe we could have a drink,
maybe have some dinner. And...

19:22.398 --> 19:26.806
But someplace informal, because
my suits are all being pressed.

19:27.005 --> 19:30.354
Well, thank you
but l have to go home early tonight.

19:30.558 --> 19:33.722
- We're auditioning for the new show.
- Are you in it?

19:33.918 --> 19:38.425
- Definitely. Are you a dancer?
- Yeah, couldn't you tell?

19:38.622 --> 19:41.622
Oh, of course.
Why don't you come by tomorrow?

19:41.822 --> 19:45.618
- l could put in a good word for you.
- No, don't do that. Please.

19:45.822 --> 19:49.083
l really don't need any help
in that department.

19:49.278 --> 19:52.661
- OK.
- Are you sure you can't go out tonight?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.486
Sorry.

19:54.686 --> 19:56.923
Well, if l don't see you any more,

19:57.150 --> 20:00.249
nice meeting you
and being insulted by you.

20:00.734 --> 20:02.676
My pleasure.

20:04.062 --> 20:09.048
- Aren't you coming tomorrow?
- l knew you wanted to see me again.

20:14.078 --> 20:15.965
Taxi!

20:19.709 --> 20:22.076
- Want to eat?
- l got to get to the club.

20:22.237 --> 20:25.467
- Why do you work at that club?
- Extra money.

20:25.662 --> 20:28.859
- There's an audition tomorrow.
- l told you a week ago.

20:29.022 --> 20:32.186
- Really?
- Yeah. You'll audition, won't you?

20:32.382 --> 20:34.804
Why not?
Rejection's a hobby now.

20:35.006 --> 20:37.177
Oh, listen to you!

20:37.534 --> 20:40.982
Small world, isn't it?
Goodnight.

20:41.181 --> 20:44.051
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Do you know her?

20:44.254 --> 20:46.905
- Just informally.
- How did you meet her?

20:47.102 --> 20:49.818
She was passing.
l said she was an OK dancer.

20:50.014 --> 20:51.956
You told her she's OK!

20:52.158 --> 20:55.573
- Something to that effect.
- She's a great dancer!

20:55.774 --> 20:59.090
- Whose is the limo?
- l think it belongs to her.

20:59.294 --> 21:01.912
- She comes from money.
- Really?

21:02.078 --> 21:05.209
ls she heavily involved
with someone?

21:05.406 --> 21:07.413
What do you mean?

21:07.613 --> 21:10.613
Has she got a lot of guys
drooling over her?

21:11.358 --> 21:13.943
l don't want to hear
if you're hot over somebody.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.313
l just respect her dancing.

21:17.438 --> 21:21.464
Did you hear the way she talks?
lt's so intelligent. l love it.

21:21.661 --> 21:26.396
An accent doesn't make you intelligent.
lf it did, you'd be Einstein.

21:26.557 --> 21:30.933
Jackie, l'm not trying to make
you jealous. You're a good dancer.

21:31.134 --> 21:33.949
- What can l say?
- Don't play these games.

21:34.141 --> 21:37.141
- What games?
- l'll see you tomorrow.

21:38.654 --> 21:41.174
Come on, l don't even know her!

21:44.189 --> 21:47.735
Are you sure you don't want
something to eat?

21:50.622 --> 21:52.444
Manero, you've got a way with words!

22:18.526 --> 22:20.501
Very good. Excellent!

22:21.725 --> 22:26.035
Just in case you've got to hear it
again, it's whoever's right for the show.

22:27.166 --> 22:30.614
Michelle, Tracy...

22:30.814 --> 22:32.985
Smitty...

22:33.182 --> 22:36.859
Karen, yes...
Sorry.

22:37.054 --> 22:39.388
Jackie, you worked real hard.
Yes.

22:39.582 --> 22:43.062
- OK, that's it. Next group!
- OK, men please!

22:50.366 --> 22:53.181
- Hi, l'm Joy.
- l'm happiness.

22:54.142 --> 22:58.779
l bet you are.
l'm the assistant choreographer.

22:58.973 --> 23:03.251
Any questions regarding the routine,
please ask me now.

23:04.573 --> 23:10.324
Listen up! This time, try the whole
combination right through to the end.

23:10.526 --> 23:13.842
lf l don't see you again,
you got beautiful legs.

23:14.046 --> 23:15.900
- So do you.
- Listen up!

23:16.093 --> 23:18.908
lf you've finished dancing,
move off stage!

23:19.422 --> 23:22.172
You're always causing trouble.
Get out of here!

23:22.717 --> 23:25.084
OK, now get ready.
Joy, count it down.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.253
OK, music!

23:56.573 --> 23:59.443
That's good.
That's enough, thank you.

23:59.645 --> 24:02.165
We need pictures, résumés,
phone numbers.

24:02.366 --> 24:05.530
We'll get back to you.
You were all excellent,

24:05.725 --> 24:09.108
but l only need two.
Thank you.

24:26.493 --> 24:28.435
Hello, Jimmy.

24:31.229 --> 24:34.099
- lt's Tony!
- Oh, whatever.

24:38.045 --> 24:41.558
- l know what you must be thinking.
- Do you?

24:43.261 --> 24:45.498
They'll call. Don't worry.

24:47.101 --> 24:48.890
Whatever.

24:49.086 --> 24:51.933
- You were very good.
- Thank you.

24:52.126 --> 24:54.100
- l mean it.
- Really?

24:54.302 --> 24:58.077
- Yeah.
- Sounds like you appreciated me.

24:58.877 --> 25:01.081
Yes, you could say that.

25:01.278 --> 25:04.125
- Could l ask you something?
- What?

25:05.341 --> 25:08.690
lf you appreciate me
and l appreciate you,

25:08.894 --> 25:13.149
how about getting together
and we could appreciate each other?

25:13.342 --> 25:16.571
- Appreciate?
- Yeah, like for many hours.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.733
l have a singing lesson
l'll have to cancel.

25:19.933 --> 25:23.577
That's all right. l got a dance class
l'd have to cancel.

25:23.773 --> 25:26.740
And then l'd have to cancel
my manicure.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.455
l'd have to cancel
my meeting with the mayor.

25:31.165 --> 25:34.548
And then l'd have to cancel
my yoga class.

25:36.125 --> 25:40.316
That's all right.
l'd have to cancel my brain operation.

25:40.478 --> 25:43.412
Do you think that's a good idea?

27:41.053 --> 27:43.736
Laura, are you rich or something?

27:43.933 --> 27:46.802
l told you, it isn't important.

27:47.006 --> 27:50.388
- Why? ls it some secret?
- lt's just furniture.

27:50.557 --> 27:54.005
Come on! You'd have to work 1 0 shows
to afford this.

27:55.486 --> 27:57.395
Oh, shush.

27:57.629 --> 28:02.418
- Look, we had a good time.
- What? Did l miss something here?

28:02.622 --> 28:05.077
l changed the subject.
We had a good night.

28:05.309 --> 28:08.178
We had a great night.
Great night.

28:10.781 --> 28:13.018
l want to tell you something.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.635
You don't know me well.

28:15.869 --> 28:19.185
And with my past,
l don't respect many people.

28:19.357 --> 28:22.324
- But l do respect you.
- Oh. Thank you.

28:22.526 --> 28:27.643
And when you dance, oh, man,
l could watch you for hours. Really!

28:27.869 --> 28:31.579
- lt's like watching smoke move.
- l know.

28:32.222 --> 28:36.858
lt's like you've done something
with your life. You're significant.

28:39.581 --> 28:42.363
l think it's time
we said goodnight.

28:43.038 --> 28:46.267
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! lt's just 3.00.

28:46.461 --> 28:51.350
- And l've got to rehearse tomorrow.
- Are you serious?

28:51.517 --> 28:53.405
- Yeah.
- Definitely?

28:53.598 --> 28:56.565
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, this is a flash. You can't...

28:56.765 --> 29:00.213
- l've never been asked to leave.
- Don't take it personally.

29:00.797 --> 29:05.532
- l've got to! There's nobody else here!
- That's true. Well...

29:05.726 --> 29:10.101
Definitely? This is it?
l mean, tonight, it's over, that's it?

29:10.301 --> 29:14.906
Oh, no! Oh, Tony,
you don't think that, do you? Do you?

29:16.253 --> 29:18.620
lt's just until tomorrow.

29:36.605 --> 29:38.579
- Hello?
- Jackie!

29:38.781 --> 29:41.563
Tony?
Where are you?

29:41.789 --> 29:45.401
l'm making sure the streets are safe
for women and children.

29:45.629 --> 29:48.564
- Somebody`s got to do it.
- Are you OK?

29:48.765 --> 29:51.253
- Great! Are you alone?
- What?

29:51.454 --> 29:55.228
Are you alone?
ls there a vacancy next to you?

29:56.189 --> 29:59.637
- There's a vacancy. Why?
- l was just curious.

29:59.838 --> 30:04.060
Why are you up so late?
A professional should watch her health.

30:04.253 --> 30:07.384
l'll see you tomorrow
if l don't drown.

30:11.741 --> 30:13.683
That boy is strange.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.705
Ring.

30:43.261 --> 30:45.944
Don't touch that phone!
Get off!

30:46.141 --> 30:49.174
Yes! Yes, this is Tony Manero.
Are you kidding?

30:49.373 --> 30:53.082
Hold on a second...
Turn down the radio!

30:54.301 --> 30:56.243
l got it?
You're kidding?

30:56.445 --> 30:59.314
- That boy is crazy.
- When do l start?

30:59.549 --> 31:04.339
What time? Where? All right!
Thank you! Thank you! l'll be there!

31:05.085 --> 31:07.190
Way to go, Manero!

31:21.053 --> 31:22.068
- Hello?
- Ma.

31:22.237 --> 31:25.466
Tony!
Well, it's about time l hear from you.

31:25.661 --> 31:28.563
Guess what?
l got a job on Broadway!

31:28.765 --> 31:31.002
You got a job on Broadway?
Doing what?

31:31.229 --> 31:35.288
- Dancing! Don't you remember l dance?
- No nudity, l hope!

31:35.485 --> 31:38.169
Keep your clothes on. You hear me?

31:38.365 --> 31:41.049
- You hear me?
- Come on, come off it.

31:41.245 --> 31:44.758
- How are you doing?
- l'm all right, l'm fine! OK.

31:44.957 --> 31:48.535
l'll call you later
and tell you all the details.

31:48.733 --> 31:50.675
OK, bye-bye.

31:53.341 --> 31:55.283
l love youse.

31:57.661 --> 31:59.603
l got to change my residence.

32:02.653 --> 32:06.036
l hope we never change

32:06.269 --> 32:08.724
lf you feel the same

32:08.925 --> 32:12.570
Time will make us so much stronger

32:12.765 --> 32:16.180
You give it all to me

32:16.477 --> 32:18.964
l give it back to you

32:19.165 --> 32:23.126
We give our love to one another

32:50.781 --> 32:54.971
Waking up with my eyes open wide

32:55.165 --> 32:59.060
Waking up, you`re still sleeping
by my side

32:59.613 --> 33:03.410
You`ve been the heart of me

33:04.253 --> 33:07.963
You`ve been the one

33:09.533 --> 33:13.078
You spoke so soft and tenderly

33:13.277 --> 33:18.132
You spoke so soft and tenderly

33:18.333 --> 33:22.130
You pulled the soul from under me

33:22.333 --> 33:26.643
You bring it out from under me
You bring me love, now can`t you see

33:26.845 --> 33:31.123
You bring it out from under me
You`ll get it all for free

33:38.973 --> 33:40.915
- Hi!
- You're doing great.

33:41.117 --> 33:45.110
Oh, thanks. Congratulations!
l heard you're in the show!

33:45.277 --> 33:48.987
- Things are happening.
- Yeah. Are you going to work now?

33:49.181 --> 33:51.637
Yeah, l've got to give in my notice.

33:51.869 --> 33:55.284
You didn't put in a word for me
with the director?

33:55.485 --> 33:57.340
- No!
- l got this on my own?

33:57.533 --> 33:58.962
- Yes.
- Really?

33:59.165 --> 34:01.237
- Really!
- All right!

34:01.469 --> 34:04.916
That singer and you
were harmonising a little too well.

34:05.117 --> 34:08.859
- He's just a friend.
- Why is he staring at you like that?

34:09.853 --> 34:11.795
- Come on, Tony, don't.
- No, really.

34:12.029 --> 34:15.706
- He's staring at you.
- What is wrong with you?

34:15.900 --> 34:19.000
l don't know.
l just don't like guys like that.

34:19.228 --> 34:23.931
- You are crazy tonight.
- Maybe l'm feeling a little emotional.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.185
- Meet me after work?
- Yeah, two o'clock.

34:28.380 --> 34:32.210
- OK. l'll see you at two.
- You got a commitment.

34:36.637 --> 34:40.597
Waking up with my eyes open wide

34:40.829 --> 34:45.018
Waking up,
you`re still sleeping by my side

34:45.213 --> 34:49.621
Waking up with my eyes open wide

34:49.821 --> 34:53.847
Waking up, you`re still sleeping

34:54.333 --> 34:57.464
Waking, waking, waking up

35:04.477 --> 35:06.843
Hello. lt's very cold.

35:07.037 --> 35:07.637
- Laura!
- Tony!

35:10.045 --> 35:11.419
- How are you doing?
- l'm fine.

35:11.613 --> 35:13.555
But you look like you're freezing.

35:13.757 --> 35:15.732
- No, no.
- We all set?

35:15.933 --> 35:19.894
Mark, this is Tony.
Tony was just hired to be in the show.

35:20.093 --> 35:21.718
Good.

35:21.917 --> 35:25.178
- Would you like a drink?
- l've got to be going.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.340
All right,
l'll see you at rehearsals then,

35:28.541 --> 35:31.541
and get out of the cold
before you crack.

35:33.693 --> 35:35.635
Nice meeting you.

36:05.085 --> 36:08.380
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

36:08.573 --> 36:11.290
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

36:11.485 --> 36:15.227
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

36:15.421 --> 36:18.323
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

36:18.525 --> 36:20.281
One, two, three, four.

36:21.533 --> 36:23.507
That's it. Relax!

36:25.181 --> 36:30.134
We have a conceptual interpretation
problem, which is easy to overcome

36:30.333 --> 36:34.773
if you forget that you're dancers
working for a couple of bucks.

36:34.973 --> 36:39.479
You're translators of body language.
That's all dancing is: body language.

36:39.677 --> 36:43.768
So don't waste my time
going through the motions of emotions.

36:43.964 --> 36:46.681
You got to feel
what the hell you're doing.

36:46.877 --> 36:49.081
The show's called ''Satan's Alley''.

36:49.277 --> 36:53.335
lt's a journey through hell.
lt ends with an ascent to heaven.

36:53.533 --> 36:57.843
lt's simple, but if it's going to work,
you've got to bust your asses!

37:03.453 --> 37:07.926
- l didn't say anything.
- But l... Shoot me. Shoot me twice.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.867
- lt's all right, really.
- l got hung up. What can l say?

37:12.061 --> 37:13.817
You don't have to say anything.

37:14.013 --> 37:17.493
When you say that,
l know you want me to say something.

37:17.693 --> 37:22.166
- OK, what do you want to talk about?
- l don't know. What about you?

37:22.364 --> 37:25.713
lt's the lovers, the young lovers.

37:29.661 --> 37:33.938
- l've got to get going.
- l'll give you a call later, all right?

37:34.141 --> 37:36.083
l'll call you later.

37:37.053 --> 37:39.923
lf you're really her friend,
do her a favour.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.514
- What?
- Teach her to dance.

37:42.749 --> 37:45.051
There's nothing wrong
with her dancing.

37:45.244 --> 37:48.343
l really like her, too.
But she's ordinary.

37:48.540 --> 37:52.053
- But you're very good.
- Where are you coming from?

37:52.253 --> 37:55.701
- ls something wrong?
- l don't like being led on.

37:55.901 --> 37:59.250
- Who's leading you on?
- l call you up, you're not home!

37:59.452 --> 38:03.576
Then l wait all night for you and
you bring some guy home with you.

38:03.773 --> 38:07.253
- Are you talking to me?
- Did what we did mean nothing?

38:07.453 --> 38:11.795
- lt was nice.
- Nice, everyday! Like breakfast?

38:12.028 --> 38:15.825
l usually skip breakfast.
Look, l'll see you later.

38:15.997 --> 38:18.517
- l'm talking to you!
- l said later.

38:18.748 --> 38:22.010
- Come here!
- Take your bloody hands off me!

38:22.205 --> 38:24.987
Do you think l'm some little groupie?

38:25.181 --> 38:29.403
We met, l liked you, we made it.
What do you think it was? True love?

38:29.597 --> 38:32.564
You think l used you!
What about you using me?

38:32.765 --> 38:35.732
Everybody uses everybody, don't they?

39:05.725 --> 39:07.700
Hold it, hold it!

39:11.933 --> 39:15.545
- What's this?
- l thought we decided to go downstage.

39:15.740 --> 39:19.734
True, but then l changed it
to the upstage position.

39:19.932 --> 39:21.939
lt was better going downstage.

39:22.141 --> 39:24.345
- Was it?
- Much better.

39:24.540 --> 39:29.876
l'll tell you what's even better: you
learn the routine the way l laid it out!

39:31.229 --> 39:34.098
- Again.
- And... five, six, seven, eight.

39:41.021 --> 39:45.211
- What if l come over about nine?
- How do l know you'll show?

39:45.404 --> 39:48.022
- Come on!
- Are you sure you'll be there?

39:48.221 --> 39:52.247
- Definitely. We'll go out.
- What, Christmas carolling?

39:52.445 --> 39:54.419
How did you know?

39:54.621 --> 39:56.563
All right! l'll see you later.

39:56.764 --> 40:01.750
- No talking to strangers.
- Nobody's stranger than you. See you.

40:05.597 --> 40:08.979
Tony. l'm having
a few friends around tonight.

40:09.181 --> 40:11.799
A pre-Christmas party.
Like to come?

40:12.028 --> 40:14.199
Didn't we just have a fight?

40:14.429 --> 40:16.850
We didn't have a fight, Tony,
you did.

40:17.053 --> 40:20.631
l hope that's all resolved
and l'd like to see you.

40:20.797 --> 40:22.968
- What time?
- Oh, ten-ish.

40:23.900 --> 40:28.057
- l don't know.
- Consider yourself officially invited.

40:28.252 --> 40:32.147
- Whose limo is this?
- l'll see you about ten.

40:34.141 --> 40:36.083
Bye.

40:38.716 --> 40:40.691
Whose limo is this?

40:42.460 --> 40:45.013
Anybody know whose limo this is?

40:53.564 --> 40:56.728
You know, l don't care
if l ever get a message.

41:26.077 --> 41:29.273
- Where to?
- Laura Revell's place, where else?

41:29.436 --> 41:31.411
Are you expected?

41:31.612 --> 41:33.587
To do what?

43:18.557 --> 43:21.371
l was wondering where you were.
You look nice.

43:21.564 --> 43:23.026
- You do, too.
- Thank you.

43:23.197 --> 43:27.539
What would you like to drink?
We have champagne, wine, whisky...

43:27.740 --> 43:29.496
- l don't believe this.
- What?

43:29.692 --> 43:33.653
- Now you're with the director.
- l'm not with anybody.

43:33.852 --> 43:38.325
- Haven't you learnt anything?
- What do you mean? Are we in school?

43:38.524 --> 43:40.793
Why don't we go out
on the balcony?

43:40.956 --> 43:44.502
There's an awfully nice view
of New York. Come on.

43:54.396 --> 43:58.968
lf you want to leave, that's
your choice. Maybe you had better go.

43:59.164 --> 44:00.987
- What's your problem?
- What?

44:01.180 --> 44:03.864
Do you think
you can play with people?

44:04.060 --> 44:07.257
Do you? Oh, look, Tony.

44:07.452 --> 44:11.446
l'm not playing with anyone. l invited
you because l think you're interesting.

44:11.644 --> 44:14.100
Most people here are interesting.

44:14.300 --> 44:18.523
- Why be upset? There are pretty girls.
- l came to be with you!

44:19.228 --> 44:21.879
And l'm expecting someone else.

44:23.260 --> 44:26.424
Why did we even start this thing up,
huh?

44:27.036 --> 44:29.818
Start?
Look, you came to me, remember?

44:30.844 --> 44:35.122
- You did nothing? lt was just me.
- Whatever.

44:35.324 --> 44:37.844
Anyway, l'm freezing out here.

44:39.420 --> 44:44.177
lf nothing else, you'll have
an interesting chapter for your diary.

44:44.380 --> 44:46.453
You know the way out.

44:46.652 --> 44:48.594
Merry Christmas.

45:08.253 --> 45:13.468
l can`t take all the blame now, can l?

45:14.492 --> 45:19.577
lt takes more than one
to lose such a fine line

45:19.773 --> 45:24.661
That lies between
but holds together

45:24.860 --> 45:27.708
Hearts in the night

45:27.901 --> 45:29.843
Touch at a time

45:30.044 --> 45:35.761
And l`m finding out the hard way

45:35.964 --> 45:38.746
lt`s going to take some tears

45:38.940 --> 45:42.039
A little bit of heartache

45:42.268 --> 45:46.163
We`re like islands in the stream

45:46.364 --> 45:51.481
Watching all our dreams start to fade

45:51.676 --> 45:54.643
Fading away

45:56.316 --> 46:00.691
A moment gone is gone forever

46:02.172 --> 46:05.816
lt`s like water through your hands

46:06.012 --> 46:11.762
And you spin the wheel of misfortune

46:12.860 --> 46:15.544
Watching it turn

46:15.740 --> 46:18.424
You live and you learn

46:18.620 --> 46:21.337
l keep reaching out

46:21.532 --> 46:24.347
And come up empty-handed

46:24.540 --> 46:26.679
When did l let you down?

46:26.908 --> 46:29.297
Or did l leave you stranded?

46:29.501 --> 46:34.203
And l`m finding out the hard way

46:34.397 --> 46:37.211
lt`s going to take some tears

46:37.404 --> 46:40.186
A little bit of heartache

46:40.380 --> 46:44.504
And we`re like islands in the stream

46:44.796 --> 46:49.531
Watching all our dreams start to fade

46:50.076 --> 46:52.443
Fading away

46:53.052 --> 46:55.670
Start to fade

46:55.836 --> 46:58.585
Fading away

46:59.100 --> 47:01.686
Start to fade

47:02.044 --> 47:04.248
Fading away

47:04.444 --> 47:08.722
Fade away

47:27.772 --> 47:31.088
- Jackie, l'm sorry.
- l don't want to see you tonight.

47:31.293 --> 47:34.107
l just forgot to call you.
l'm really sorry.

47:34.300 --> 47:37.147
l know, but you can't
treat me like this any more.

47:37.340 --> 47:40.853
- l won't.
- l can't always be second choice.

47:41.052 --> 47:43.769
- You're not.
- l am, and you know l am.

47:43.964 --> 47:46.681
l promise it'll never happen again.

47:47.261 --> 47:50.424
Yes, it will.
lt will if l let it.

47:52.061 --> 47:55.409
Do you know how many times
you've done this to me?

47:55.612 --> 47:59.638
l love you so much, Tony.
Don't you know that?

47:59.836 --> 48:02.619
You keep treating me like this.

48:04.380 --> 48:07.064
- What can l say to you? l...
- Nothing.

48:07.260 --> 48:09.497
You don't have to say anything.

48:09.692 --> 48:12.889
l'll be your friend,
but no more than that.

50:17.404 --> 50:20.982
- Can l get you something else?
- No, l'm full.

50:21.692 --> 50:25.718
- Have another piece of pie.
- No, really, l'm full now, Mom.

50:25.948 --> 50:29.526
Come on, have another piece.
l made it special.

50:33.052 --> 50:35.507
OK, the hell with it, then.

50:36.316 --> 50:39.699
Put it away, have it for lunch,
who knows?

50:43.164 --> 50:45.204
You know, it's weird...

50:45.756 --> 50:50.513
This house seems so much smaller
than when l used to live in it.

50:51.676 --> 50:53.848
What do you mean, smaller?

50:54.044 --> 50:57.360
You know, the opposite of bigger.
Smaller.

50:58.492 --> 51:02.322
l mean, what do you want me to do?
What do you want, stretch it?

51:02.524 --> 51:05.491
l was just making an observation,
that's all.

51:08.380 --> 51:10.616
Tony, why did you come today?

51:12.924 --> 51:17.528
- l've got a lot of things on my mind.
- Like what? What things?

51:19.164 --> 51:23.288
The way l used to act around here.
l was very hard on you.

51:23.484 --> 51:27.128
And l just wanted to say
it's not me, all right?

51:27.772 --> 51:29.746
That wasn't me.

51:30.780 --> 51:34.009
- Are you kidding me?
- No, l'm apologising to you.

51:34.204 --> 51:40.020
Apologising for what? Are you saying
that wasn't the real you back then?

51:40.220 --> 51:42.162
Yeah.

51:42.363 --> 51:45.811
l had a lot of attitude
and l just didn't like it...

51:48.028 --> 51:50.613
- l don't believe this.
- Believe it!

51:50.812 --> 51:54.325
l don't believe it!
And don't get fresh with me!

51:54.556 --> 51:58.200
This attitude you're talking about...

51:58.844 --> 52:02.422
That's what got you out
of this damn neighbourhood.

52:02.620 --> 52:06.777
You don't need to apologise.
You must have done something right.

52:09.884 --> 52:12.404
So you're saying
l've always been this bastard,

52:12.604 --> 52:17.306
but it's all right
because it comes natural to me?

52:17.660 --> 52:19.765
- Something like that.
- Yeah?

52:19.964 --> 52:22.200
Yeah! Yeah. Double yeah.

52:29.500 --> 52:33.461
l'll have another piece of this pie.
lt's very good.

52:33.884 --> 52:36.120
Better than stuff l get in New York.

52:37.884 --> 52:40.983
l bought you a ticket for the show.
26 bucks.

52:44.444 --> 52:46.419
l'm a hot shot now.

53:01.372 --> 53:03.925
Lay back, Butler.
Extend! Extend!

53:09.019 --> 53:10.775
Enough!

53:11.260 --> 53:16.017
Maybe it's me, Butler. Maybe l'm not
getting across what l want.

53:18.780 --> 53:20.918
You still ticklish, huh?

53:22.300 --> 53:26.162
What l want is a much more
forceful type movement.

53:28.892 --> 53:31.859
- lt's a very sensual show, Butler.
- Right.

53:33.019 --> 53:37.143
So, let's try to be sensual.
Try it. You might like it.

53:39.580 --> 53:41.522
Once again.

53:44.604 --> 53:47.124
- What do you think?
- She's good.

53:47.323 --> 53:51.447
- What about him?
- He's good, but he's too mechanical.

53:58.172 --> 54:01.555
- What are you doing later?
- l've got commitments.

54:01.756 --> 54:03.861
- You do?
- Yeah, l do.

54:04.060 --> 54:07.126
- You don't.
- You don't think l have other plans?

54:07.323 --> 54:09.778
- No.
- Well, you're wrong.

54:09.980 --> 54:12.697
- l can tell when you're lying.
- How?

54:12.891 --> 54:17.169
- How can you tell when l'm lying?
- Who's your commitment with?

54:17.372 --> 54:19.314
l'll never tell.

54:19.516 --> 54:21.370
l'll go out with you.

54:21.564 --> 54:24.215
- Excuse me?
- The three of us.

54:24.411 --> 54:27.411
Oh, you're sick.
You are sick.

54:29.116 --> 54:30.904
No, really, later?

54:48.892 --> 54:51.543
l don't know what you did,
but she hates me.

54:51.739 --> 54:55.088
- l didn't do nothing.
- Come on, Tony, stop lying.

54:55.644 --> 54:58.939
l mean, it's becoming
a regular thing with you.

54:59.132 --> 55:02.099
- That bad, huh?
- That bad.

55:05.435 --> 55:09.461
- So what are we doing here?
- l wanted to ask you a favour.

55:09.660 --> 55:12.693
- What favour?
- Could you meet me here tonight?

55:13.244 --> 55:17.499
- No, l don't think l can.
- l will owe you for life if you do.

55:18.011 --> 55:20.662
l know l treat you bad
and l got terrible manners.

55:20.860 --> 55:25.464
But so did the people l grew up with.
Some of it rubs off.

55:26.203 --> 55:30.993
There's a gentleman inside here
dying to get out. Really.

55:31.228 --> 55:33.170
Come on, would you?

55:34.460 --> 55:37.242
Please. How about it?

55:42.075 --> 55:44.442
- OK.
- Thank you.

55:44.668 --> 55:46.610
You're welcome.

56:10.652 --> 56:15.289
- l didn't think you were showing up.
- l'm sorry. The show ran late.

56:15.484 --> 56:19.280
- Tony, you remember Carl. Carl, Tony.
- How are you doing?

56:19.484 --> 56:21.939
- l need to ask you something.
- Me, too.

56:22.139 --> 56:27.060
That guy's a musician. l didn't think
you was the musician type.

56:27.260 --> 56:32.977
- He plays rhythm guitar at the club.
- Rhythm guitar? That's the worst!

56:33.180 --> 56:37.937
Everybody knows you can't trust a guy
who plays rhythm guitar.

56:39.484 --> 56:42.833
Underneath the curls, he's a pervert.
l can feel it.

56:43.036 --> 56:45.589
Did you take funny pills today?

56:45.756 --> 56:48.025
- How did you get in here?
- The window.

56:48.219 --> 56:50.772
- You amaze me.
- l don't like him.

56:51.004 --> 56:55.673
- Looks like a demented paratrooper.
- He is just a friend!

56:56.220 --> 56:59.416
- Listen, thanks, Carl.
- ls everything all right?

56:59.612 --> 57:03.125
- Fine. She's in good hands.
- Are you Allstate, pal?

57:03.323 --> 57:06.225
- Yeah, you want disability?
- l'll see you Wednesday.

57:06.395 --> 57:09.778
- All right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

57:15.291 --> 57:17.779
Did you see
how you said goodnight to him?

57:17.979 --> 57:20.183
Oh, great!
No, how did l say it?

57:20.380 --> 57:24.722
lt was like syrup.
l got a cavity just listening to it.

57:24.924 --> 57:27.095
What are we doing here?

57:29.020 --> 57:32.882
l want to...
l want to try Butler's routine.

57:33.083 --> 57:36.083
l want to ask Jesse
to have a shot at replacing him.

57:36.284 --> 57:40.178
- You're kidding?
- No. You think l can do it?

57:41.563 --> 57:45.524
- l think so.
- Well... do you want to help me?

57:46.844 --> 57:50.008
- l think so.
- Let's go.

57:51.100 --> 57:54.416
- l think you're a little jealous.
- No way.

01:00:02.907 --> 01:00:04.915
- Walk you home?
- No, it's OK.

01:00:05.115 --> 01:00:07.865
- Sure?
- Positive. Thanks anyway.

01:00:08.059 --> 01:00:10.907
All right.
Thanks a lot, Jackie.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.002
You're welcome. Goodnight.

01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:22.903
Hey, Jackie! Remember l mentioned a
gentleman that was anxious to get out?

01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:26.448
- Well, he'd like to walk you home.
- OK.

01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:29.466
You're lucky.
This neighbourhood is dangerous.

01:00:31.868 --> 01:00:35.545
- You didn't give that musician a key?
- No!

01:00:35.739 --> 01:00:37.943
- Did you?
- No!

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.082
Just checking.

01:00:43.419 --> 01:00:47.281
- So what do you think?
- No, it's what you think.

01:00:47.484 --> 01:00:50.931
- You think l ought to try it?
- You've got the routine.

01:00:51.131 --> 01:00:54.164
- But is it good enough?
- Yeah.

01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:57.210
- ls it?
- Yeah. Well... Goodnight.

01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.378
Goodnight, Jackie.

01:00:59.835 --> 01:01:02.202
Hey, Jackie, wait a minute.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:08.442
l want to say something to you,
but it's really hard because...

01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:12.464
l'm just not used to saying
nice things to you.

01:01:16.284 --> 01:01:19.895
l think we had something
really comfortable, right.

01:01:20.091 --> 01:01:23.026
Something really... really nice.

01:01:23.195 --> 01:01:25.978
And l was thinking
that l was really...

01:01:26.171 --> 01:01:29.368
The way l acted towards you
was really wrong.

01:01:30.843 --> 01:01:33.014
l don't want to lose you.

01:01:35.803 --> 01:01:39.698
l feel really comfortable with you
and l was thinking

01:01:39.899 --> 01:01:44.242
that if you feel the same way,
and l feel the same thing for you,

01:01:44.443 --> 01:01:47.443
then maybe we could
get back together.

01:01:50.492 --> 01:01:52.434
l love you, Jackie.

01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:13.844
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:02:14.043 --> 01:02:17.076
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:02:17.307 --> 01:02:19.860
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:02:20.059 --> 01:02:22.841
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:02:23.067 --> 01:02:26.416
- Two, two, three, four...
- Hold it, hold it!

01:02:32.476 --> 01:02:34.450
Take a break.

01:02:35.195 --> 01:02:38.163
- lt's not me, is it?
- Nope. You're fine.

01:03:18.491 --> 01:03:22.266
- l think l can do it.
- Do what?

01:03:22.459 --> 01:03:25.972
- You're being unreasonable!
- l won't jeopardise my career...

01:03:26.171 --> 01:03:28.538
- Nor will l.
- He's an amateur!

01:03:28.731 --> 01:03:32.855
- l want you to try it with him!
- You've been taken in...

01:03:33.051 --> 01:03:38.201
l haven't. Now try it, and keep your
personal feelings out of it! Let's go.

01:03:38.427 --> 01:03:40.369
OK.

01:03:43.355 --> 01:03:46.803
- Butler, sit this one out.
- What do you mean?

01:03:47.003 --> 01:03:48.858
- You know.
- l don't!

01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:51.571
Sure, you do!
Manero!

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.587
You know the first combination.

01:04:03.195 --> 01:04:04.984
Music.

01:04:40.699 --> 01:04:43.733
ls this a dance
or a bloody circus?

01:04:47.099 --> 01:04:49.520
- Forget it, man!
- Too right!

01:04:50.139 --> 01:04:51.830
What are you looking at?

01:04:55.227 --> 01:04:57.463
- Wait!
- l don't want to talk about it.

01:04:57.659 --> 01:04:59.601
Don't walk out
and expect to come back!

01:04:59.803 --> 01:05:02.935
- ls that right?
- You walk out now, you're over!

01:05:03.131 --> 01:05:06.709
- What would you do?
- l'm not the one who's on the line.

01:05:06.875 --> 01:05:12.756
- l don't want anybody laughing at me!
- Who are you, somebody special?

01:05:12.987 --> 01:05:16.664
l give you a chance
for a Broadway lead and you walk out!

01:05:16.859 --> 01:05:19.444
- Who cares?
- Nobody has to care!

01:05:19.643 --> 01:05:23.156
l don't have to care about you,
or you about me.

01:05:23.355 --> 01:05:28.822
lf you want to dance here, you follow
my rules! lt's not a democracy!

01:05:29.019 --> 01:05:32.151
You are not the greatest dancer
to hit Broadway!

01:05:32.315 --> 01:05:37.366
You have anger and intensity. That's
what l need to make this show work.

01:05:37.563 --> 01:05:41.174
You think you're so terrific
you'll score another show?

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:44.240
The best thing that you ever scored
is Laura.

01:05:44.443 --> 01:05:48.720
But you blew that because
you're different kinds of people.

01:05:48.923 --> 01:05:51.640
You're never going to change that.

01:05:51.867 --> 01:05:56.623
lf you had half a brain, you'd stop
trying to change other people

01:05:56.795 --> 01:06:00.373
and start worrying
about changing yourself!

01:06:01.947 --> 01:06:05.842
- Everyone uses everyone, don't they?
- Go to hell, Manero!

01:06:06.043 --> 01:06:08.018
Who cares, man?

01:06:17.691 --> 01:06:19.960
All right, starting positions.

01:06:20.187 --> 01:06:22.326
And... five, six, seven, eight.

01:06:22.523 --> 01:06:25.938
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Hold it!

01:06:37.883 --> 01:06:41.179
- Butler, would you mind?
- This is bullshit!

01:06:52.859 --> 01:06:56.437
- Count it down.
- And five, six, seven, eight.

01:08:05.787 --> 01:08:06.386
Again!

01:09:17.883 --> 01:09:19.671
