WEBVTT

00:06.940 --> 00:11.210
Oh, whose dirty underwear
are these?!

00:11.212 --> 00:12.945
Don't look at me,
dr. P.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.847
I've been wearing mine
for a week.

00:16.316 --> 00:18.183
- Cranissaa!
- ( grunts )

00:18.918 --> 00:21.653
That's splat.
He's my dojo partner.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.622
To keep our fighting instincts
razor-sharp,

00:23.624 --> 00:25.924
We attack each other
at random moments.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.960
We call them...

00:32.499 --> 00:35.734
Also known as
"cranissaa"...

00:35.736 --> 00:38.270
Which can be confusing
'cause there's a girl

00:38.272 --> 00:40.706
In our class
named clarissa.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.643
You got him good, splat.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.845
Right, did you
see his face?

00:46.847 --> 00:49.448
He was like,
"ee-oo-er-fer--
doy!"

00:49.450 --> 00:52.951
Hey, I don't say,
"doy!"

00:52.953 --> 00:56.922
But sadly, everything
else is accurate.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.858
You know what,
that was my underwear.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.295
Then whose are these?

01:04.264 --> 01:07.833

02:06.026 --> 02:08.494
Liv, chill.
What is wrong with you?

02:08.496 --> 02:11.930
Okay, international
teen sensation kathy kan

02:11.932 --> 02:12.998
Is coming here today.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.533
( high-pitched scream )

02:16.069 --> 02:19.338
And that is
the last one of those.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.773
The kathy kan?
The korean pop star?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.041
Yeah, you know
who she is?

02:23.043 --> 02:24.943
Are you kidding?

02:24.945 --> 02:27.980
I eat lunch
with her every day.

02:27.982 --> 02:31.049
Wow!  You have
a kathy kan lunchbox.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.084
Uh-huh.
I won it

02:32.086 --> 02:34.653
In a heated online
fanboy auction.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.788
I did have to trade
my collection

02:36.790 --> 02:38.023
Of "hobbit" dress socks,

02:38.025 --> 02:41.059
But it was worth it.

02:41.061 --> 02:44.096
Well, she is going
to be here all week

02:44.098 --> 02:46.598
To study me
as an actress.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.934
They're redoing
♪ "sing it loud"

02:48.936 --> 02:51.103
In korea
and she's been cast

02:51.105 --> 02:53.672
To play stephanie einstein
the character that I created

02:53.674 --> 02:56.341
On the original
♪ "sing it loud."

02:56.343 --> 02:58.343
So you know, if you could
just like be cool.

02:58.345 --> 03:02.548
Liv, are you kidding?
They call me the ice man.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.018
( high-pitched screaming )

03:06.020 --> 03:08.420
Kathy kan!

you're here.

I am such a big fan.

Liv rooney,

03:44.692 --> 03:46.925
I'm a huge fan
of yours.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.060
I'm so excited
for this week

03:48.062 --> 03:49.094
It's gonna be
totally...

03:49.096 --> 03:50.429
Both:
Sparkle-riffic.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.630
( shrieks )

03:53.032 --> 03:55.133
Okay, you are signing
all of these

03:55.135 --> 03:57.102
And I am getting
my "hobbit" socks back.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.039
Also, I like your bow.
Welcome to america.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.914
Oh, boom!  Ha!

04:08.916 --> 04:12.584
Even with a hurt knee
I am destroying you in horse.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.787
I even gave you
a huge head start

04:15.789 --> 04:17.990
And started myself off
with h-o-r-s,

04:17.992 --> 04:20.692
And all you had to do
was make one shot.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.497
But, uh, you're about
to lose again.

04:25.499 --> 04:29.134
I have never beaten maddie
at anything that requires

04:29.136 --> 04:30.769
Athletic ability.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.038
I know.
Shocking.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.741
Yeah, all right.
Whatever.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.117
It went in.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.485
It did?!

04:46.487 --> 04:47.519
I mean...
( clears throat )

04:47.521 --> 04:49.187
Yeah, whatever.
Of course it did.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.723
Okay, but I mean,
you couldn't make

04:51.725 --> 04:53.091
That shot again
even if you tried.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.060
Oh, I don't have
to make it.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.695
You do.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.631
( clears throat )

04:59.633 --> 05:00.966
( chuckles )

05:00.968 --> 05:02.167
Okay.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.537
<i>( glass shatters )</i>

05:10.043 --> 05:12.110
That's h-o-r-s-e.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.213
I beat maddie!

05:15.215 --> 05:17.516
You know what?
Let's go again.
'cause I want a rematch.

05:17.518 --> 05:21.186
No, no, no.
I'm retired from basketball...

05:22.188 --> 05:24.189
Forever.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.994
I'm just gonna ride off
into the sunset on my horse,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.929
Which is spelled
h-o-r-s-e.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.864
Oh, wait.
You already knew that.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.033
( whinnies )

05:38.938 --> 05:39.938
Tv theme song:
<i>♪ pink, pink, pink</i>

05:46.847 --> 05:48.046
<i>♪ best friends!</i>

05:49.115 --> 05:51.016
"linda and heather"
is my favorite show.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.085
It's about two girls
who are best friends

05:53.087 --> 05:56.621
But always wind up
in crazy hijinks.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.557
My dojo bros
think it's for girls.

05:58.559 --> 06:02.661
Okay, pink and glitter, maybe.
But twirls are for everyone.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.132
Oh, hey, splat.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.901
( whispering )
hey, mrs. Rooney.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.103
Is parker home?

06:11.105 --> 06:12.938
Yeah, he's in the living room,
splat.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.172
Why are you carrying a club?

06:14.174 --> 06:16.742
I'm going to cranissaa parker.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.111
Okay, just don't
cra-break anything.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.579
( laughs )

06:20.581 --> 06:21.947
Heather:
<i>Linda, I told you,</i>

06:21.949 --> 06:23.715
<i>I don't need your help</i>
<i>getting harvey.</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:25.951
<i>I wish you'd</i>
<i>never come home.</i>

06:25.953 --> 06:27.986
What?
No, don't say that, heather.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.921
She's your bestie!

06:29.923 --> 06:33.125
You're watching
"linda and heather"?

06:33.127 --> 06:35.093
What?
Uh, no.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.094
Cranissaa!

06:40.600 --> 06:43.969
Parker, dude,
that show's for girls.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.204
Okay, I was
flipping channels,

06:46.206 --> 06:48.106
Saw the diabolical
younger brother

06:48.108 --> 06:50.041
Blowing stuff up,
and forgot to change it

06:50.043 --> 06:51.977
Once the girls came on.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.045
Technically,
that's a true story.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.648
It's just I've been forgetting
to change the channel

06:56.650 --> 06:58.250
For two years now.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.855
No way, you recorded
the whole season.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.793
Before I knew
how awful it was.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.128
I mean, it's not like
I like the show.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.864
I love the show.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.033
Then I guess
you'll have no problem
deleting them all.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.935
Yeah, sure,
I'll delete them.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.203
No problem.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.174
You mean now?

07:23.309 --> 07:26.845
I feel like I just lost
my best friend...

07:26.847 --> 07:29.214
And her best friend.

07:32.852 --> 07:33.985
( gasps )

07:33.987 --> 07:36.087
The liv rooney
diva board?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.723
The legend is true.

07:38.725 --> 07:41.393
I have a special
little surprise for you.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.896
( clears throat,
inhales deeply )

07:44.898 --> 07:48.133
( singing in korean )

07:50.102 --> 07:51.903
"sing it loud,"
in korean!

07:51.905 --> 07:53.872
Yeah!
( speaking korean )

07:53.874 --> 07:55.207
That means,
"thanks, sweet mama."

07:56.676 --> 07:58.743
Okay, seriously though,
how did you learn

07:58.745 --> 08:00.045
To speak such
perfect english?

08:00.047 --> 08:02.714
By watching you
play stephanie einstein

08:02.716 --> 08:04.082
On ♪ "sing it loud!"

08:05.818 --> 08:08.386
Ugh, I cannot wait to teach
you how to play her.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.288
She is such
a lovable airhead.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.358
Yes, make me smart
about how to be dumb.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.061
Okay, so capturing stephanie
is a threefold process.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.963
One, sing and look
cute as a button--

08:17.965 --> 08:19.898
Check and check--

08:19.900 --> 08:22.300
And two, ability
to deliver snappy one-liners.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.369
So here's an example
from episode 78, ready?

08:25.705 --> 08:27.973
( breathes deeply )

08:27.975 --> 08:31.710
"I am so done with you.
We are in a text-only
relationship

08:31.712 --> 08:32.911
Until further notice."

08:34.247 --> 08:36.314
Got it.
Episode 32.

08:36.316 --> 08:41.086
"when I say I won't tell anyone,
I've already told everyone."

08:42.755 --> 08:45.056
Okay, hit me.
What's the third key
to stephanie?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.224
Okay, are you ready?

08:46.226 --> 08:48.159
The ability
to pretty cry.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.195
( clears throat )

08:50.197 --> 08:52.030
( gasps, sighs )

08:52.032 --> 08:53.932
( whimpers )

08:54.934 --> 08:56.468
Got it.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.170
( wailing )

08:59.172 --> 09:01.439
( sobbing )

09:01.441 --> 09:03.275
Oh, okay.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.310
That cry is
not that pretty.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.113
I knew it.
Kathy can't!

09:08.115 --> 09:09.247
Kathy can't!
Kathy can't!

09:09.249 --> 09:15.453
( laughs nervously )
now, you're a fun
little whackadoo.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.922
Um, but honestly,

09:16.924 --> 09:18.189
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.158
Till like halfway
through season one.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.893
( laughs )

09:21.895 --> 09:23.495
Um, so let's just make
this week a fun week, yeah?

09:23.497 --> 09:25.430
Perfect, we'll hang out
with all your friends

09:25.432 --> 09:29.067
And be all
real-girl normal.

09:29.069 --> 09:33.004
Yeah, um, so...

09:33.006 --> 09:37.475
Slight truth bomb time.
Um, ever since I moved back

09:37.477 --> 09:39.978
It's been a little hard
to make friends.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.112
Please don't judge me,
I'm trusting you

09:41.114 --> 09:42.380
With my super-secret shame.

09:42.382 --> 09:46.017
No, it's okay.
I totally get it.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.153
Ever since I hit
number one in korea

09:48.155 --> 09:50.088
With my first single,
"happy sugar fun time"...

09:52.391 --> 09:54.192
It's been hard for me
to make friends, too.

09:55.394 --> 09:58.196
Well, then maybe...

09:58.198 --> 10:00.832
We can just be
real-girl normal together.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.500
Do you know how
to do that?

10:02.502 --> 10:03.902
No, I have no idea.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.439
Oh, but you know what?
We can ask maddie.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.440
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.075
( pounding )

10:10.077 --> 10:12.544
Joey, get back out here
right now and give me a rematch

10:12.546 --> 10:15.180
Before I rip your eyebrows off
and feed them to you!

10:15.182 --> 10:16.481
( loud thud )

10:18.351 --> 10:20.185
Yeah, so maybe
we won't ask maddie.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.119
Okay!

10:25.524 --> 10:29.127
( loudly )
join the real-girl
normal club.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.163
( loudly )
wow, don't mind if I do.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.333
That sounds like a club
for girls like us.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.371
( squeals )

10:39.373 --> 10:41.306
Let the friend
feeding frenzy begin.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.374
Yeah!

10:43.442 --> 10:46.144
And so,
superintendent kneebauer,

10:46.146 --> 10:49.848
I have really relaxed
the rules on hallway posters.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.150
Let the kids
express themselves.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.119
This hallway
looks like a funhouse.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.154
Exactly.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.889
It is fun to get
your education on.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.190
A what, what?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.628
Man versus zombie
versus squirrel?

11:03.630 --> 11:06.865
A what, what
where you thinking?

11:06.867 --> 11:09.267
Instead of promoting you,
maybe I should have

11:09.269 --> 11:11.069
Moved you
into the cafeteria.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.838
No, I cook all day at home.
I cannot do it here.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.908
Then show me you're ready.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.277
A new vice principal
needs to take control.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.612
Copy that.

11:20.614 --> 11:25.050
All right, everybody,
take these posters down, now!

11:25.052 --> 11:28.153
If I see one poster up
after 3:00 pm,

11:28.155 --> 11:31.156
You will see me
in detention!

11:31.158 --> 11:33.892
I am vice principal,
you will fear me!

11:35.394 --> 11:36.961
Better?

11:36.963 --> 11:39.130
I'm still picturing
you in a hairnet.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.167
( both chuckle )

11:42.169 --> 11:44.069
Can you believe
that crazy woman?

11:44.071 --> 11:46.971
Yeah, that crazy woman
is my mom.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.576
The last vice principal
we had was super strict

11:51.578 --> 11:55.380
( gasps )
are you saying
we should prank her?

11:55.382 --> 11:59.984
( chuckles )
no.  I could
never prank my mom.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.486
People love pranksters.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.923
It's got real-girl normal
written all over it.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.958
You're not wrong.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.127
She may have torn down
our posters,

12:09.129 --> 12:11.463
But the real-girl
normal club lives on.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.131
Let's do this.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.666
Both:
♪ ooh, ooh!  Oom!

12:14.668 --> 12:16.234
♪ ooh, ooh!  Oom!

12:19.305 --> 12:21.172
Hey, mads,
what you up to?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.174
Besides not beating
me at basketball.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.509
<i>( joey chuckles )</i>

12:24.511 --> 12:26.111
You remember that?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.212
I do.

12:28.647 --> 12:32.117
I could not live in a world
where joey beats maddie,

12:32.119 --> 12:35.086
So I had to defeat him
at something-- anything.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.589
Clearly though it was not
going to be t-shirt making,

12:37.591 --> 12:39.457
'cause he's the master.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.161
Oh, wow.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.996
Look at that.
What a shame,

12:44.998 --> 12:47.098
There is only
one waffle left.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.399
Hm...

12:48.401 --> 12:51.302
What do you think,
you care to fence me for it?

12:55.975 --> 12:57.041
Sorry, mads.

12:57.043 --> 13:00.178
I have retired
from all competition.

13:02.248 --> 13:05.583
Enjoy your waffle.
My victory sustains me.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.521
See you at school.

13:09.523 --> 13:12.123
There's an extra
one of these on your bed.

13:17.429 --> 13:20.465
<i>( rock guitar playing )</i>

13:27.306 --> 13:29.040
What's up, my dudes?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.642
Y'all want to hit
the weights after this

13:30.644 --> 13:32.143
And get yoked?

13:33.212 --> 13:36.147
I was hoping splat forgot
about "linda and heather"

13:36.149 --> 13:40.385
But just in case,
I wanted to reintroduce him
to my man-ness.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.188
I got the idea from an episode
of "linda and heather."

13:43.190 --> 13:44.556
Where's splat?

13:44.558 --> 13:46.558
Need to talk to him
about guy stuff--

13:46.560 --> 13:49.227
You know, karate,
lightning bolts, cannons.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.663
Cranissaa!

13:51.665 --> 13:53.131
( screams )

13:57.169 --> 14:00.071
Epic cranissaa, brah.

14:00.073 --> 14:03.474
Want to talk gator wrestling
or go break something?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.411
Dude, are you being all weird
'cause I caught you watching--

14:06.413 --> 14:09.647
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.082
But are you
gonna be cool

14:11.084 --> 14:13.484
About what we're
not talking about?

14:13.486 --> 14:18.389
Parkster, I would never
say a word about...

14:18.391 --> 14:20.091
( whispers )
"linda and heather."

14:20.093 --> 14:22.460
Bros before shows.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.063
Thanks, splat.
I'm gonna go warm up.

14:36.810 --> 14:40.144
During the most humiliating
moment of my life,

14:40.146 --> 14:43.381
I gotta admit, that song
kind of chased my blues away.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.227
Ready to get
your prank on?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.263
I've got
industrial strength glue

14:58.265 --> 15:00.098
And an appetite
for mischief.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.668
B.T. Dubs,
you look amaz

15:03.670 --> 15:05.236
In your sneaky-sneak
outfit.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.404
Aww, thank you.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.772
You look redizzle.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.375
Both:
Double selfie!

15:12.478 --> 15:15.079
( shutters clicking )

15:15.081 --> 15:17.248
Mom said no posters
on the walls.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.816
I sure hope
she likes 'em glued

15:18.818 --> 15:20.518
To her office floor.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.255
Well, we had
to put them somewhere.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.657
There's no room
on the walls,

15:25.659 --> 15:27.158
With a desk
glued to it.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.328
Excellent prank, miss kan.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.529
Why thank you,
miss rooney.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.400

Okay, let's get out of here
before anybody sees us.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.174

15:46.245 --> 15:48.813
Ha!  What's wrong
with this door?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.415
I glued it.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.849
You said glue everything.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.219
What?!
No no no no no.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.688
I glued the windows, too.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.356
I'm very thorough,
it's one of my things.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.691
I also do calligraphy.

16:02.494 --> 16:03.928
( sighs )

16:03.930 --> 16:05.496
Okay, kathy...

16:05.498 --> 16:06.898
This is
my mom's office, right?

16:06.900 --> 16:09.534
If she catches us,
she's gonna glue
me to the wall!

16:10.602 --> 16:13.171
We just have
to hide the evidence.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.245
We need a better plan.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.447
What would
stephanie einstein do?

16:22.449 --> 16:23.815
I'm pretty sure
she would pretty cry,

16:23.817 --> 16:26.250
But I don't think I have
any pretty left in me.

16:26.252 --> 16:29.153
( both wailing )

16:41.834 --> 16:44.936
Parker, there are
a couple of friends
here to see you.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.206
Hi, linda!

16:48.208 --> 16:51.209
Do you think any boys
watch our show?

16:51.211 --> 16:52.944
No, heather.
Why would they?

16:52.946 --> 16:55.947
It's not for boys,
it's for girls!

16:57.416 --> 16:58.850
We burned him, splat.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.419
Yeah, we did.
Boom, chicken soup.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.855
Okay, yep.
You guys got me.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.226
Wait a second.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.961
"boom, chicken soup."

17:09.963 --> 17:12.897
That's a very odd expression,
where'd you hear that?

17:12.899 --> 17:14.665
Uh, duh, it's linda's
catchphrase.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.300
Boom, chicken soup!

17:17.269 --> 17:19.737
Nobody would know that
unless they watch

17:19.739 --> 17:20.938
"linda and heather."

17:20.940 --> 17:22.540
You guys watch it, too.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.242
Boom, chicken busted.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.644
( boys laughing )

17:26.646 --> 17:28.913
I thought I was the only guy
that watched it.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.949
It's funny.
It has a lot of heart.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.722
Hey, you guys
can stop laughing.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.524
Yeah, that's right.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.992
I watch "linda and heather."

17:40.994 --> 17:42.827
That's my truth.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.595
Those gals
make me laugh

17:44.597 --> 17:47.265
And that makes
me feel alive.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.267
So why do we tease
each other

17:49.269 --> 17:53.237
Who made up the rule
that boys can't like

17:53.239 --> 17:55.506
A show about girls?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.308
The shame stops today.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.577
If you're with me.
Say it loud and say it proud.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.546
- Boom!
- Both: Chicken soup!

18:01.548 --> 18:03.681
- I said boom!
- Both: Chicken soup!

My shot bounced
off the ground here,

18:30.043 --> 18:33.678
Hit the wall, and went
directly into the net.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.582
If you are unclear
on what the net is,

21:05.731 --> 21:07.498
( grunts )

21:07.500 --> 21:10.167
( coughing )

21:11.703 --> 21:12.937
- You know what?
- Yeah?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.639
That could have been
so much worse.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.973
We could have landed
in the boys bathroom.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.608
( both shudder )

21:17.610 --> 21:18.943
Ugh, boy stench.
Okay, let's go.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.745
Liv.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.013
I'm sorry.

21:22.015 --> 21:23.447
I thought pulling
a prank would help

21:23.449 --> 21:24.782
Us both make
some friends.

21:24.784 --> 21:28.753
( chuckles )
well, I don't know
about you,

21:28.755 --> 21:30.187
But I'm pretty sure
I made one.

21:30.189 --> 21:31.989
Me too.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.828
Okay, I'm totally
in this moment,

21:37.830 --> 21:39.463
But how does your makeup
look so perfect

21:39.465 --> 21:40.564
After falling
through the ceiling?

21:40.566 --> 21:42.833
( giggles )

21:42.835 --> 21:44.769
Oh, kathy...

21:44.771 --> 21:46.504
There are just some
secrets that even friends
don't share.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.638
Let's go.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.042
Oh!

21:53.011 --> 21:55.212
( laughs nervously )
I can explain.

21:55.214 --> 21:58.082
You see, we have
a ghost at ridgewood.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.784
He comes in--

21:59.786 --> 22:02.620
Congratulations,
rooney.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.188
They detest you.

22:05.757 --> 22:08.159
My first year they filled
my car with live chickens.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.530
You are officially
a vice principal.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.532
( sighs )
oh!  Whoo.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.735
Welcome to the club.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.270
What, what?

22:23.108 --> 22:24.742
You guys ready?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.077
Yeah, let me just
get comfortable.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.548
Ah, I'm such a heather.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.719
No way, dude.
You're a total linda.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.855

22:37.857 --> 22:38.889

22:47.833 --> 22:49.734
Being able to enjoy
"linda and heather"

22:49.736 --> 22:51.135
With my friends
felt good.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.903
Boys aren't just
a bunch of anim--

22:52.905 --> 22:53.771
Cranissaa!

22:56.942 --> 22:58.943
( chuckles )
you laid him out, splat.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.277
Boom, chicken soup.
