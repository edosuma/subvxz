FERDINAND: I will find you.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.847
I will finish Helsinki.

38:28.766 --> 38:30.518
What, you're just gonna leave now?

38:30.601 --> 38:33.270
Yes. If you were smart,
you would leave, too.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.523
You used me.

38:35.606 --> 38:36.983
You pulled me out of Iceland,

38:37.066 --> 38:38.460
you threw me in
the middle of this shit,

38:38.484 --> 38:40.486
and now you're just
gonna blow it all up?

38:40.569 --> 38:42.321
(SOFTLY) Get out of here, Sarah.

38:42.405 --> 38:44.740
No. Your friend Niki died.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.702
Beth died.

38:47.785 --> 38:49.662
What about our sisters
that are still alive?

38:54.458 --> 38:55.793
No, I'm sorry.

39:03.175 --> 39:06.429
Two wires, battery, plastic explosives.

39:06.512 --> 39:07.930
Taped together pretty well.

39:08.014 --> 39:12.268
And you're absolutely certain
there is only one circuit?

39:12.727 --> 39:14.186
Far as I can see.

39:14.270 --> 39:17.356
You and me, we're even now.
You understand?

39:17.440 --> 39:19.608
You saved me, and I saved you.

39:19.692 --> 39:22.653
I'm gonna cut this wire
and leave the building.

39:22.737 --> 39:25.322
Then, and only then,
are you gonna stand up.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.907
Am I clear?

39:26.991 --> 39:28.367
Just give me a moment.

39:28.451 --> 39:30.286
Because if there's
more than one circuit,

39:30.369 --> 39:31.471
the whole thing could just...

39:31.495 --> 39:34.123
Damn it, Siobhan, let me prepare myself!

39:35.124 --> 39:36.125
All right, all right.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.252
I'm sure this whole thing
is gonna be fine.

39:38.335 --> 39:40.713
It's... When I get out of here,

39:40.796 --> 39:43.007
I'm going to be a little short of funds.

39:43.090 --> 39:44.592
You're a clever chap.

39:44.675 --> 39:47.636
I'm sure you'll find some way
to make yourself useful.

My opinion on Charlotte's treatment
couldn't wait till morning?

Well?

40:32.640 --> 40:34.141
(SIGHS)

40:36.727 --> 40:40.064
Immunosuppressive therapy
likely won't save her.

40:41.273 --> 40:45.861
Untreated, her data has value.
More value than her life.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.157
We shouldn't intervene.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.705
That's what you
wanted to hear, isn't it?

40:59.667 --> 41:01.544
I need to go away again.

41:02.878 --> 41:03.879
Why?

41:05.798 --> 41:09.635
Have you found Sarah? Kendall?

41:18.853 --> 41:21.188
We know you contacted Ferdinand.

41:24.859 --> 41:27.653
As you wish, we won't treat Charlotte.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.240
You're right to think of the future.
