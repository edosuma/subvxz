- Nobody was there.

They don't even film

This Nixon candle is really good.

02:42.744 --> 02:44.333
My Young Republican club

02:44.334 --> 02:45.743
to raise money for the campaign.

02:45.744 --> 02:47.243
That's Pinocchio, not Nixon.

02:47.244 --> 02:48.703
Either way, it's a good notion.

02:48.704 --> 02:50.203
We're setting up a table

02:50.204 --> 02:51.623

02:59.244 --> 03:01.743
Well, I'd need more wax.

Some day when you tell folks
you were a Nixon supporter,

03:12.164 --> 03:13.663

04:28.954 --> 04:31.203
What's with the camera?
Is this somebody famous?

04:31.204 --> 04:33.533
The original Lassie
is buried here somewhere.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.493
He was really a boy, by the way.

04:35.494 --> 04:37.243
This is the grave of Jean Kittering.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.993
The first women doctor in this area.

04:38.994 --> 04:41.123
So, who did women go to
before he came along?

04:41.124 --> 04:43.151
A woman doctor, not a doctor for women.

04:43.176 --> 04:44.689
So he wouldn't treat women?

04:44.730 --> 04:46.278
No,<i> she</i> was a woman.

04:47.124 --> 04:49.163
Oh!

04:49.164 --> 04:51.413
And I assumed because Jean was a doctor

04:51.414 --> 04:52.833
she couldn't be a woman.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.623
That's a nice reminder
that women can do anything.

04:55.624 --> 04:57.833
Except play Lassie...

04:57.834 --> 04:59.384
who is around here somewhere.

05:00.914 --> 05:03.373
<i>Because it's somebody's birthday!</i>

05:03.374 --> 05:04.793
<i>Is it?</i>

05:04.794 --> 05:06.586
<i>Yeah!</i>

05:06.611 --> 05:08.901
<i>- No?!</i>
- Here you are. "Boxcar Benji."

05:09.834 --> 05:12.333
- Outstanding.
- I thought so.

05:12.334 --> 05:14.953
"All audience members must be
10 years of age or younger."

05:14.954 --> 05:16.596
Oh, no problem.

05:16.621 --> 05:18.737
My headshot says I can play 8 to 25.

05:18.762 --> 05:20.299
An "ID will be required."

05:20.324 --> 05:22.019
I'll get you a fake ID, easy.

05:22.044 --> 05:24.293
I-I could even get you
a pilot's license.

05:24.294 --> 05:25.923
By the way, if you ever hear,

05:25.924 --> 05:27.663
"This is your captain, Warren Ashby,"

05:27.664 --> 05:29.623
I suggest a hasty disembark.

05:33.874 --> 05:36.083
April Portollo?

05:36.084 --> 05:37.713
Last time I saw you
was the fourth grade,

05:37.714 --> 05:39.123
we were playing hide and seek.

05:39.124 --> 05:41.123
Well, then I'd say I won.

05:41.124 --> 05:43.083
My mom asked me to drop
these off for your mom.

05:43.084 --> 05:45.833
Yeah, she needs wax
for her Nixon project.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.293
I thought Agnew was the one made of wax.

05:47.294 --> 05:50.463
And Nixon was made out of lies
and children's tears.

05:50.464 --> 05:52.713
Well, my dad says
that in these tough times,

05:52.714 --> 05:54.373
we need a strong leader like Nixon.

05:54.374 --> 05:56.293
Hmm. What do you say?

05:56.294 --> 05:59.663
Even Catholics are entitled
to think for themselves.

05:59.664 --> 06:02.293
Hmm. I guess I repeat what my dad says,

06:02.294 --> 06:05.003
just in a less frightening tone.

06:05.004 --> 06:06.213
How often do you come out here?

06:06.214 --> 06:07.463
Just for my birthday.

06:07.464 --> 06:09.253
Which would have been
Lynn's birthday, too,

06:09.254 --> 06:11.663
if I hadn't hogged
all the amniotic fluid.

06:11.664 --> 06:16.873
That's so strange,
because I crave amniotic fluid.

06:16.874 --> 06:18.423
Oooooooooh.

06:18.424 --> 06:20.543
I'm kidding.

06:20.544 --> 06:23.123
If I was your sister's ghost,

06:23.124 --> 06:26.163
would I ask you to
take me out some time?

06:26.164 --> 06:28.123
You heard all my weird family stuff

06:28.124 --> 06:29.333
and you still want to go out with me?

06:29.334 --> 06:30.873
You're cute,

06:30.874 --> 06:32.687
plus you know a lot about Lassie.

06:32.712 --> 06:34.663
I do. For the dangerous stunts,

06:34.664 --> 06:37.423
they used a Shetland pony
in a collie suit.

06:37.424 --> 06:39.873
But I'll save the rest for our date.

06:39.874 --> 06:42.169
I should go before I change my mind.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.269
Thank you, Lynn!

06:46.294 --> 06:47.753
Oh, no.

06:47.754 --> 06:51.051
Oh, no, no! No, no! Aah! No!

06:57.941 --> 06:59.255
Oh.

I'll help.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.797
I'm definitely not having any now.

07:33.822 --> 07:35.361
Enjoy your spit cake.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.543
Or <i> you</i> could go get his present.

I worked a long day,

07:43.004 --> 07:45.043
stopped to get dinner
and a cake on my way home,

so I guess now I'll go to our bedroom

07:46.848 --> 07:48.663

07:48.664 --> 07:51.293
we put a lot of thought into.

07:51.294 --> 07:55.463

07:55.464 --> 07:57.003
Yes!

07:57.004 --> 07:59.003
Hey. Did I miss Frank's birthday?

07:59.004 --> 08:00.583
I bought him a shaving kit.

08:00.584 --> 08:03.583
Oh, so thoughtful. This is from me now.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.713
So you're still in the candle business?

08:05.714 --> 08:07.793
I just hope these Nixon people
put the money to good use.

08:07.794 --> 08:10.323
Yeah, buy more fear-mongering TV ads.

08:10.348 --> 08:11.985
Yeah, those are very good.

08:12.010 --> 08:14.493
- Vote for Nixon or ka-boom!
- Yeah.

08:14.518 --> 08:16.543
It's good to see you
doing your own thing, Mom.

08:16.544 --> 08:18.423
You've always been so talented, yeah.

08:18.424 --> 08:19.873
It's time other people saw that.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.333
Ugh, people.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.123
I like making stuff for our family.

08:23.124 --> 08:25.026
But now that I'm part of
the Nixon administration,

08:25.051 --> 08:26.163
who has the time?

08:26.164 --> 08:27.373
Other than the shaving kit,

08:27.374 --> 08:29.163
I really dropped the ball
on Frank's birthday.

08:29.164 --> 08:32.293
Then stop making candles.
Dad'll understand.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.010
Then Nixon loses, the Reds take over,

08:34.034 --> 08:35.048
the whole country's mad at me?

08:35.073 --> 08:36.003
No thanks.

08:36.004 --> 08:37.543
Mom, Pat's choking!

08:38.582 --> 08:41.370
Whoever invented candle-making
did not have kids.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.479
Under control, Peg.

08:44.504 --> 08:47.224
- Just a coin from the cake.
- Dad had me stick a few quarters in.

08:47.249 --> 08:49.298
Quarters? We use dimes and pennies.

08:49.323 --> 08:50.713
Quarters are much too generous.

08:50.714 --> 08:52.354
Oh, so this is my fault?

08:52.379 --> 08:54.541
Oh, it's out.

08:55.544 --> 08:57.201
Gosh. Honestly.

08:58.702 --> 09:00.371
Peg, this isn't working.

09:00.396 --> 09:02.856
I had to bring home Sara Lee
and McDonald's tonight.

09:02.881 --> 09:04.966
I don't want these kids
to start expecting the finer things.

09:04.996 --> 09:06.496
It's this candle rigmarole.

09:06.521 --> 09:08.707
- I was just saying to Lawrence...
- That you're gonna give it up?

09:08.732 --> 09:09.830
- Because you've really been
- Well, actually...

09:09.855 --> 09:10.914
letting things slide around here.

09:10.915 --> 09:12.204
Look, I know your heart's set on it,

09:12.205 --> 09:14.324
but I'm putting my foot down.

09:14.325 --> 09:15.994
You're putting your foot where?

09:15.995 --> 09:17.587
<i>As usual, talking to my mom like this</i>

09:17.612 --> 09:19.862
<i>just made her do the opposite
of what he wanted...</i>

09:19.915 --> 09:22.534
<i>even though it was the opposite
of what she wanted, too.</i>

09:22.559 --> 09:23.874
I'm putting it down, Peg.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.584
This candle nonsense is done.

09:26.585 --> 09:29.124
<i>Over the years, my parents
perfected a kind of arguing...</i>

09:30.180 --> 09:31.389
Candles for sale.

09:31.414 --> 09:32.608
<i>...where one of them would lose...</i>

09:32.633 --> 09:33.983
Nixon fundraising candles.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.985
<i>...and the other one would
somehow also lose.</i>

09:37.943 --> 09:40.177
I just wanted to say
happy birthday, son.

09:40.202 --> 09:41.692
<i>You get that care package Mom sent?</i>

09:41.717 --> 09:43.168
Yeah, I wore my crown to breakfast

09:43.193 --> 09:44.466
and got quite the ribbing.

09:44.491 --> 09:46.441
You know, you'd think the
Catholic Church would have

09:46.442 --> 09:48.273
a little bit more acceptance
for people in funny hats.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.489
I know your mom will miss seeing you...

09:50.490 --> 09:52.069
she's soft that way.

09:52.101 --> 09:54.569
Peg, you want to say hey to Lawrence?

09:54.570 --> 09:56.779
I'm good. They're $4 apiece.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.279
Thank you.

10:00.113 --> 10:02.719
These weirdos aren't buying
our candles patriotically.

10:02.744 --> 10:04.641
- They just want to mock our President.
- Who cares?

10:04.666 --> 10:06.335
I'm outselling everyone,
even the sturdy woman

10:06.336 --> 10:07.795
who makes pottery.

10:07.796 --> 10:11.593
Oh, your wax effigies are lovely, dear.

10:11.618 --> 10:13.835
Oh. They're really excellent,
aren't they?

10:13.836 --> 10:17.125
I do watercolor portraiture myself.

10:17.126 --> 10:20.665
Would you be interested
in an artist's trade?

10:20.666 --> 10:22.804
Careful, that could be
beatnik code for a drug deal.

10:22.829 --> 10:24.665
Shh, artists are talking.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.625
I could paint a portrait of you

10:26.626 --> 10:28.835
in exchange for one of your pieces.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.875
Oh, I would never want
a picture of myself.

10:30.876 --> 10:32.324
- I'm not that crazy.
- Oh.

10:32.349 --> 10:33.551
What I'd really love is a painting

10:33.576 --> 10:36.044
- of my unborn daughter Lynn.
- Oh.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.745
All right, Peg, you about done here?

10:37.746 --> 10:40.535
Not even close, these things
are selling like hot-pants.

10:40.536 --> 10:41.995
Well, I got to go.

10:41.996 --> 10:43.625
I've got family responsibilities...

10:43.626 --> 10:45.429
child supervision, lawn maintenance...

10:45.454 --> 10:48.455
the kind of things I put
before any frivolous hobbies.

10:48.456 --> 10:49.673
Got it.

10:49.698 --> 10:51.625
But would you mind taking this empty box

10:51.626 --> 10:53.125
we brought the candles in?

10:53.126 --> 10:55.920
There you go.
Oh, wait, this one's empty, too.

10:55.945 --> 10:58.187
And this one. This one, too.

10:58.246 --> 11:01.035
Gosh, guess I sold
more of my frivolous hobbies

11:01.036 --> 11:02.743
than I realized today.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.585
Peggy!

11:05.586 --> 11:07.564
Oh, hi, Helen.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.625
- I've been dying to catch up with you.
- Oh.

11:09.626 --> 11:11.499
Steven and I just
got back from Acapulco.

11:11.524 --> 11:14.035
- I can see your tan.
- Not all of it!

11:14.036 --> 11:16.125
The way the beaches are down there...

11:16.126 --> 11:17.819
...I'm the same color all over.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.125
Oh.

11:19.126 --> 11:20.535
You know, you and Mike should go.

11:20.536 --> 11:22.605
Maybe someday when we're older,

11:22.630 --> 11:23.901
like you and Steven.

11:23.926 --> 11:25.566
Well, why wait?

11:25.591 --> 11:27.245
I mean, you don't have
to stay where we stayed.

11:27.246 --> 11:29.085
There's plenty of lower-priced options.

11:29.086 --> 11:32.415
- These are so clever.
- Mm.

11:32.416 --> 11:34.415
You know, when you asked me
for the used altar candles,

11:34.416 --> 11:36.709
I was really worried
that the electric company

11:36.734 --> 11:38.125
had finally shut off your lights.

11:38.126 --> 11:39.405
Here's some more Pinocchios, Mom.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.342
They're Nixons now, keep up.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.702
I just saw Lynn's ghost!

11:42.727 --> 11:43.915
She followed me here!

11:43.916 --> 11:45.474
You saw the girl from the cemetery?

11:45.499 --> 11:46.745
- Where?
- This way.

11:46.746 --> 11:48.705
There's also a dead bird
you can pet for free.

11:48.706 --> 11:51.625
You know, my friend runs
the Spencer Gifts

11:51.663 --> 11:53.495
at the new Eagle Rock mall.

11:53.496 --> 11:55.848
It's very, very upscale...
I'm sure you haven't been there.

11:55.873 --> 11:58.335
But I bet that she could sell these.

11:58.336 --> 11:59.872
You think my little doodads

11:59.897 --> 12:01.739
are good enough to sell at the mall?

12:01.764 --> 12:04.295
Oh, please, you wouldn't
believe the tacky junk

12:04.296 --> 12:06.705
people waste their money on these days.

12:06.706 --> 12:08.822
Why don't I just take a few to her

12:08.847 --> 12:09.916
and see what she thinks.

12:09.941 --> 12:11.830
Oh, Helen, that is so kind of you.

12:11.855 --> 12:13.085
Gosh, I just don't understand

12:13.086 --> 12:15.085
why people say
such awful things about you.

12:18.012 --> 12:19.681
Ernie. Meet my brother.

12:19.706 --> 12:22.455
I-I'd like a false ID, please.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.303
I need to be 10 years old
to go to "Boxcar Benji."

12:25.328 --> 12:26.812
A 10-year-old with a driver's license

12:26.837 --> 12:28.441
is gonna look suspicious.

12:28.466 --> 12:29.835
Except in Honduras.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.273
They got kid taxi drivers.

12:31.298 --> 12:32.745
That place is a mess.

12:32.746 --> 12:34.745
I got to get down there
before the party's over.

12:34.746 --> 12:36.821
A passport ought to do it.
Fill this out.

12:36.846 --> 12:38.095
Have it back to you in a couple weeks.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.511
- Thanks, Ernie.
- All right.

12:39.536 --> 12:41.246
Hey, you're forgetting something.

12:44.336 --> 12:46.035
She's in there.

12:46.036 --> 12:48.455
I didn't know ghosts
went to the bathroom.

12:48.456 --> 12:50.375
- Or girls.
- Boy-oh-boy,

12:50.376 --> 12:52.453
I've been trying to find this
girl since my birthday,

12:52.478 --> 12:53.955
but I didn't even catch her name.

12:53.956 --> 12:56.481
Her name is Lynn and now she's pooping.

12:56.506 --> 12:57.625
Thanks for the help,

12:57.650 --> 13:00.092
but when she comes out, play it cool.

13:00.117 --> 13:02.697
Oh, I know how to be with women.

13:05.112 --> 13:06.861
You look beautiful, Lynn.

13:06.956 --> 13:08.495
<i>And that was the day
it was finally confirmed</i>

13:08.496 --> 13:09.765
<i>that Pat needed...</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:12.187
Glasses! I got glasses!

13:12.212 --> 13:13.476
Here, Frank.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.881
We short-changed you on your birthday,

13:14.882 --> 13:15.907
so I got you something, too.

13:18.472 --> 13:21.070
- A glasses repair kit?
- Those glasses aren't cheap.

13:21.095 --> 13:22.881
- It won't be long before that kid...
- They broke.

13:22.882 --> 13:24.756
The gift of responsibility.

13:24.781 --> 13:25.951
Thanks a lot, Dad.

13:28.012 --> 13:29.762
I just got my passport in the mail.

13:32.342 --> 13:34.711
Look at that raised lettering.

13:34.712 --> 13:36.671
For a low-life,
Ernie does exemplary work.

13:36.672 --> 13:38.211
But it says I'm from Denmark.

13:38.212 --> 13:40.085
And he gave you a bitchin' name, too.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.433
"Donk Slimhammer."

13:43.262 --> 13:45.631
The whole point was to make
"Timmy Cleary" famous.

13:45.656 --> 13:47.698
I think it's Donk's time to shine.

13:47.731 --> 13:49.690
Timmy Cleary, eh.

13:49.715 --> 13:53.048
Donk Slimhammer,
that guy's going places.

13:53.092 --> 13:54.453
I'm here!

13:54.478 --> 13:57.591
We can start Pat's birthday now.

13:57.592 --> 13:59.671
Oh. Oh.

13:59.696 --> 14:01.131
Oh, you guys started without me.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.301
Is that Mom?

14:02.302 --> 14:03.971
And you gave him his glasses,

14:03.972 --> 14:05.801
even though I'm the one
who found them on a bus bench.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.511
You sound like my mom.

14:07.512 --> 14:08.598
You're so busy, Peg,

14:08.623 --> 14:09.841
I never know when you're gonna show up.

14:09.842 --> 14:11.301
And where's everybody else?

14:11.302 --> 14:13.341
Oh... Eddie had a thing,
Timmy had a thing,

14:13.342 --> 14:15.261
Joey didn't have a thing
but he had no interest.

14:15.262 --> 14:16.708
Family birthdays are like Mass

14:16.733 --> 14:18.711
on the Feast of the Most Holy
Blood of Saint Boniface...

14:18.712 --> 14:19.881
attendance is mandatory.

14:19.882 --> 14:21.341
Except for you.

14:21.342 --> 14:23.091
Okay, you know what, Mike?

14:23.092 --> 14:24.801
Don't worry about it.

14:24.802 --> 14:26.369
I'll just do everything...
I'll do the birthdays

14:26.394 --> 14:28.711
and I'll single-handedly get
our President re-elected.

14:28.712 --> 14:30.381
But right now I'm gonna go bake Pat

14:30.382 --> 14:32.671
an old-fashioned, home-made
birthday cake from a box.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.631
- I already have a cake.
- You're getting another one!

14:41.632 --> 14:44.077
Hey, there's a present for Timmy
in the closet there.

14:44.357 --> 14:46.887
- Can I help, Momma?
- I don't know, Pat, can you?

14:46.912 --> 14:47.912
No.

14:47.937 --> 14:49.381
What the heck is this?

14:49.382 --> 14:51.921
You're getting Timmy a picture
of Eddie wearing pigtails?

14:51.922 --> 14:54.316
It's a look you might consider.
It frames your face nicely.

14:54.341 --> 14:55.474
No. You grabbed the wrong tube.

14:55.499 --> 14:57.785
That's the Lynn painting I got
from that swap meet weirdo.

14:57.810 --> 14:59.394
That doesn't look like Lynn at all.

14:59.419 --> 15:01.591
This is crazy, Mom, you have to stop.

15:01.592 --> 15:03.661
You've hung this Lynn thing
over me for way too long,

15:03.686 --> 15:05.011
trying to make me feel guilty

15:05.012 --> 15:06.841
for something I had nothing to do with.

15:06.842 --> 15:08.083
You were the last one to see her.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.381
I didn't even have eyes yet!

15:09.382 --> 15:11.171
It was a long time ago, Mom.

15:11.172 --> 15:14.069
If we can forgive the Germans,
we can maybe forgive Eddie.

15:14.094 --> 15:16.013
I haven't forgiven the Germans.

15:16.014 --> 15:18.263
You're right.

15:18.264 --> 15:20.062
Who's to say what happened in there?

15:20.102 --> 15:22.087
And it's certainly not healthy
to brood on things.

15:22.111 --> 15:23.689
- Thank you.
- Next time any of you die,

15:23.713 --> 15:25.564
I promise not to dwell.

15:25.594 --> 15:28.263
I guess I won't get it framed
and hang it over your bed.

15:28.264 --> 15:29.383
For now.

15:29.384 --> 15:31.303
The real Lynn is prettier anyway.

15:31.304 --> 15:32.514
See?

15:34.344 --> 15:36.514
My God! It's her.

15:40.934 --> 15:42.950
Hello? Directory assistance.

15:42.974 --> 15:46.536
My name is Eddie and I need you
to find a number for me.

15:48.764 --> 15:50.263
Nice threads.

15:50.264 --> 15:52.183
Is that the latest fashion
from Copenhagen?

15:52.184 --> 15:53.643
It's gonna be hard slipping away.

15:53.644 --> 15:55.513
Mom seems extra excited
about this birthday.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.026
She loves birthdays.

15:57.051 --> 15:59.763
Another chance to take a bow
for pushing out eight kids.

15:59.764 --> 16:02.304
Congratulations,
you did what a cat can do.

16:05.224 --> 16:08.013
Hells bells! That hair, Lawrence.

16:08.014 --> 16:09.383
You walk in a room these days,

16:09.384 --> 16:10.763
I think it's Jesus come to take me.

16:10.764 --> 16:12.067
Then I realize it's just you

16:12.092 --> 16:13.683
and I still have to do
tomorrow's laundry.

16:13.684 --> 16:15.183
While you're at it...

16:15.238 --> 16:18.553
Oh, there's my boy! Or girl.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.143
Getting harder to tell these days.

16:20.144 --> 16:22.207
It's just hair, Dad...
trying something different.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.847
- Everybody wants to be "different."
- Mm.

16:23.872 --> 16:25.541
You know what would really be different?

16:25.566 --> 16:29.221
Just being the same.
"The same" would be different.

16:29.246 --> 16:31.723
Hmm. You got some sort
of point there, Dad.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.513
I'm gonna go wash up for the party.

16:33.514 --> 16:36.383
The party. Your surprise for Timmy.

16:36.384 --> 16:37.652
Mm.

16:37.677 --> 16:39.263
You're full of surprises.

16:39.264 --> 16:42.053
Helen Portollo just dropped off a check.

16:42.054 --> 16:43.473
They paid me for my candles.

16:43.474 --> 16:45.093
Apparently you're selling
them in the mall now?

16:45.094 --> 16:46.399
The Spencer Gifts in Eagle Rock,

16:46.424 --> 16:47.596
and they're going like gang-busters.

16:47.621 --> 16:49.593
They even outsold those teeth
that run around on tables.

16:49.594 --> 16:50.766
At what price, Peg?

16:50.791 --> 16:52.013
$3.99.

16:52.014 --> 16:53.736
10% off if you say Peggy sent you.

16:53.761 --> 16:55.223
I mean what it costs your family.

16:56.884 --> 16:59.183
It doesn't cost us anything,

16:59.184 --> 17:02.321
in fact here's a check
with my name on it.

17:02.346 --> 17:03.763
"Mrs. Michael Cleary."

17:03.764 --> 17:04.933
And I'm not letting anything slide.

17:04.934 --> 17:05.934
The kids are all fed and clothed.

17:05.935 --> 17:07.183
I know where most of them are,

17:07.184 --> 17:08.229
and I'm about to throw Timmy

17:08.253 --> 17:09.448
the best party he's ever had.

17:09.473 --> 17:12.051
So what exactly is the problem, Mike?

17:12.169 --> 17:15.588
Everybody out to the garage!
We're having a party!

17:15.644 --> 17:17.303
Why do you look so stupid?

17:17.304 --> 17:18.762
It's Danish.

17:18.763 --> 17:20.433
Okay, you wouldn't get it.

17:20.434 --> 17:22.343
I've got five minutes to catch my bus.

17:22.344 --> 17:24.733
What on earth does Mom need
to show me in the garage?

17:24.759 --> 17:26.012
Maybe they finally rented you

17:26.013 --> 17:27.643
that boxing kangaroo you always ask for.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.383
I'm not getting my hopes up again.

17:29.384 --> 17:31.803
Timmy, I know you love
that show with the bum.

17:31.804 --> 17:34.383
So I tried to get you tickets
but found out you were too old.

17:34.384 --> 17:37.384
So I did the next best thing.

17:44.184 --> 17:45.683
Ta-da!

17:45.684 --> 17:47.553
You did all this?

17:47.578 --> 17:48.908

18:40.184 --> 18:42.169
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

18:42.223 --> 18:44.513
I stashed a sliver away

18:44.514 --> 18:47.803
before those jackals
snarfed it all down.

18:47.872 --> 18:49.392
I'm fine, thank you.

18:54.025 --> 18:55.303
Mmm.

18:55.304 --> 18:57.803
Is that cherry I'm tasting
in your frosting?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.378
That piece was meant for Pat.

18:59.417 --> 19:00.863
I mixed some cough syrup in

19:00.949 --> 19:03.355
to try to tamp him down a notch.

19:03.434 --> 19:06.355
You gave Timmy a heck of a party, Peg.

19:06.434 --> 19:08.973
You're running things around
here like you always did

19:09.098 --> 19:10.598
and also making money.

19:12.264 --> 19:14.624
I've got no right to complain.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.757
Oh, Mike.

19:17.384 --> 19:20.758
That's so... true.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.561
I guess I just like being the one

19:22.586 --> 19:24.781
that brings home the bacon around here.

19:24.844 --> 19:28.172
When I saw that check today,

19:28.341 --> 19:30.170
it just made me feel like...

19:30.276 --> 19:32.739
...what am I here for?

19:32.784 --> 19:35.029
Are you kidding?

19:35.097 --> 19:39.553
I look around at our family
and what we've built...

19:39.671 --> 19:42.420
I realize you're the only person
I like in this house.

19:42.462 --> 19:43.883
I feel the same way.

19:44.345 --> 19:46.513
And I-I want to be supportive.

19:46.861 --> 19:50.779
So, just know that I'm happy
you're making candles,

19:51.077 --> 19:52.286
and I want you to keep doing it.

19:52.343 --> 19:53.225
I'm gonna quit.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.013
What? No, you have a talent.

19:55.014 --> 19:57.023
I insist you use it.

19:57.125 --> 19:58.483
Are you putting your foot down?

19:59.884 --> 20:02.577
I'll be using my foot very judiciously

20:02.624 --> 20:04.013
from here on out.

20:04.062 --> 20:06.499
Mike, I never wanted to be
a high-powered career woman

20:06.554 --> 20:10.553
like Mary Tyler Moore or Betty Crocker.

20:10.617 --> 20:13.195
I'll just go back to being a
creative genius around here,

20:13.242 --> 20:14.774
like I've always been.

20:15.203 --> 20:20.028
Here, use this to pay
the Water and Power,

20:20.106 --> 20:22.120
finally replace the asbestos
in the attic.

20:22.145 --> 20:23.934
Look, it'd be great to get new asbestos.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.029
But no, this is yours.

20:27.106 --> 20:29.782
- Spend it on something you really...
- Acapulco.

20:29.807 --> 20:31.383
Acapulco?

20:31.515 --> 20:32.782
The one in Mexico?

20:32.807 --> 20:34.284
Whichever one that show-off Helen

20:34.331 --> 20:36.056
and her stupid bald husband went to.

20:36.081 --> 20:37.963
She had a margarita, big deal.

20:37.995 --> 20:39.884
All right, we'll go to Acapulco.

20:39.923 --> 20:41.962
Oh, you're coming, too?

20:41.963 --> 20:44.172
Yeah.

20:44.173 --> 20:47.499
I'm thinking about getting
one of those all-over tans.

20:47.524 --> 20:49.292
Yeah. I'm <i> definitely</i> doing that

20:49.293 --> 20:50.881
whether the beach we're on
allows it or not.

20:56.170 --> 20:58.061
<i>A few weeks later when it was
Joey's birthday,</i>

20:58.100 --> 20:59.962
<i>his wish was that we all
go to the beach.</i>

20:59.963 --> 21:01.462
Whoo-hoo!

21:01.463 --> 21:03.252
<i>My mom and dad were glad to accommodate</i>

21:03.323 --> 21:05.112
<i>since they were already
headed to the beach.</i>

21:05.189 --> 21:07.112
<i>In Acapulco.</i>

21:08.065 --> 21:09.150
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

21:09.175 --> 21:11.752
<i>But the rest of us were happy
to give Joey his birthday wish,</i>

21:11.819 --> 21:13.819
<i>a family beach day.</i>

21:17.141 --> 21:18.381
<i>That he didn't have to go to.</i>

21:18.444 --> 21:20.030
Have fun! Take your time!

21:21.405 --> 21:25.280
Girls...
