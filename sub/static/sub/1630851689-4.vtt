00:26.151 --> 00:27.569
Was Choi Mujin killed?

00:31.865 --> 00:32.741
No.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.993
He wasn't here.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.623
<i>No.</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:41.583
<i>We're fine.</i>

00:42.959 --> 00:44.127
Thank you.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.142
Ms. Kang.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.560
Yes.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.978
Should we prepare ourselves?

01:02.479 --> 01:03.605
We are not

01:04.189 --> 01:06.316
affiliated with the gym
in any official manner.

01:06.816 --> 01:07.776
Exactly.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.156
Don't give the cops anything.
Make sure no one talks.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.240
Yes, sir.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.663
Did you look into it?

01:20.747 --> 01:21.956
They say it didn't record.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.168
That's bullshit.
Look how many cameras they have.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.463
Gangs don't trust the police.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.117
Is this the only camera here?

01:57.200 --> 01:59.077
Yes, that's right. This is the only one.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.966
Is this delivery truck
assigned to this area?

02:14.050 --> 02:16.636
Please let me know if you hear anything.

02:16.719 --> 02:17.554
I will.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.157
Let's go that way.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.329
None of the victims are talking.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.374
I wonder who came back.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.335
Were you scared?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.172
It must've been your first time.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.634
It's been a while for me too.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.263
There hasn't been anyone
this ballsy before.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.766
DO NOT ENTER
UNDER INVESTIGATION

03:04.767 --> 03:06.185
But don't be scared.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.270
We're cops.

03:08.646 --> 03:09.731
I'm not scared.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.108
I'm sure.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.655
Yes?

03:20.658 --> 03:21.826
On my way, sir.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.579
Ask around more. I have to go.

03:40.386 --> 03:44.224
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?

04:58.256 --> 04:59.173
Pildo.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.175
What are you doing?

05:11.602 --> 05:12.603
We're in mourning.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.897
Yes, we know.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.608
We came to pay our respects, punk.

05:20.903 --> 05:21.946
Out of my way.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.880
Just one will be enough.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.342
Fine.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.928
We didn't bring condolence money anyway.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.101
That must hurt.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.213
Give me a drink too.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.707
A dog's fate…

06:58.668 --> 07:00.044
follows its master's.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.714
The same dog can live in luxury

07:03.798 --> 07:05.842
if it lucks out with a good master,

07:06.676 --> 07:09.595
or it can die on the street.

07:11.013 --> 07:11.931
It's a dog's death.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.602
It must be nice being a cop.

07:18.354 --> 07:22.108
Even incompetent louses like you
can become captains.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.738
You would've been stabbed to death
long ago if you were in our world.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.747
I'm sick of this too.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.959
Let's put an end to it soon.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.591
How do you think you'll go out?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.597
Why would I think about that?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.648
I only know one thing.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.448
That you can't catch me
no matter what you do.

08:17.705 --> 08:18.789
Hey.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.667
What are you all doing here?

08:23.127 --> 08:23.961
Here.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.714
Let me know if you ever want to talk.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.467
Don't you want to talk?

08:30.218 --> 08:31.636
I'm sure you have lots to say.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.531
Think long and hard.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.033
You guys can't catch them anyway.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.620
Let's go, Detective Jeon.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.039
See you around.

09:09.423 --> 09:13.302
Where is that bitch hiding anyway?

09:13.886 --> 09:16.472
I'll let you have a taste once we get her.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.683
What the hell? Are you drunk?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.309
My bad.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.394
You can't

09:21.894 --> 09:23.396
do it anymore, right?

09:24.272 --> 09:25.481
You motherfucker.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.442
So let's catch that bitch

09:28.985 --> 09:30.778
and kill her.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.242
Why are we not getting buyers?

09:36.325 --> 09:37.660
We gave out so many!

09:39.370 --> 09:41.289
Should I call Mango?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.042
Is Mango getting funny ideas?

09:48.379 --> 09:49.672
Tear him apart!

09:58.347 --> 10:03.019
DONGCHEON’S CHOI MUJIN STING OPERATION
BALLISTICS FORENSICS ANALYSIS REQUEST

10:07.940 --> 10:08.858
Good work, sir.

10:09.942 --> 10:10.818
Find anything?

10:11.652 --> 10:12.486
No.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.779
Sergeant Jeon!

10:14.447 --> 10:15.364
Hello.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.992
Hey, search this.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.328
Did you find anything?

10:20.911 --> 10:24.415
We have no witnesses or footage.
It'll be hard to identify suspects.

10:24.498 --> 10:27.418
Pildo. Who am I?

10:28.044 --> 10:29.295
Gosh.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.091
This is the kind of guy I am!

10:37.386 --> 10:38.888
It's from a delivery van dashcam.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.974
I went all the way to Seongan
to track down the driver.

10:42.558 --> 10:43.517
Who is this?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.311
He looks familiar. Let's look him up.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.356
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

10:48.439 --> 10:49.649
A girl.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.034
Captain, doesn't he look familiar?

11:01.744 --> 11:04.622
Do Gangjae, this asshole
used to be in Dongcheon.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.041
He suddenly disappeared four years ago.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.793
But he's back.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.170
Did something happen back then?

11:11.796 --> 11:14.090
There was a rumor
that someone died at the gym.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.636
How will Choi Mujin react?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.264
We're after him,
so he'll probably stay low, right?

11:25.142 --> 11:26.435
He can't do that.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.188
Choi Mujin

11:29.980 --> 11:31.273
had his pride hurt.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.238
Find Gangjae.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.157
Making a move now is dangerous.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.121
Are you afraid?

11:46.705 --> 11:47.915
No, sir.

11:51.001 --> 11:54.004
If we don't retaliate,
the organization will crumble.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.884
I have to show them who I am
and what Dongcheon

12:00.511 --> 12:01.846
is all about.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.147
First,

12:13.190 --> 12:14.191
let Mango go.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.276
-What?
-What?

12:15.943 --> 12:17.111
Let's see what Choi Mujin does.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.947
What about Do Gangjae?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.490
Should we put out an APB?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.033
You'll just let him be?

12:23.117 --> 12:25.161
No. Just for the time being.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.080
We'll get Choi Mujin…

12:29.415 --> 12:30.875
while Gangjae has him rattled.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.003
Four people have died.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.215
If the two gangs collide, more will die.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.300
Does it…

12:41.969 --> 12:44.138
not matter how many gang members die?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.433
Those assholes can die.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.689
Let's get Choi Mujin first.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.192
Oh, boy.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.794
MANGO IS BEING RELEASED.
IT'S A TRAP.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.367
-The Musan branch has arrived.
-Get them ready.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.792
The other organizations
are awaiting your instructions.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.256
Send them all away.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.217
Pardon?

14:05.469 --> 14:06.804
Is there anyone you trust?

14:08.931 --> 14:09.765
Yes.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.102
Cha Giho is trying to play me,

14:15.563 --> 14:16.730
so I'll play.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.382
-You saved the best for yourself.
-You can have it.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.383
Gosh.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.551
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.511
Hey.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.515
Any word from the team
monitoring Dongcheon?

14:51.599 --> 14:52.933
They're quiet.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.144
Our guys are going around gathering intel,

14:55.227 --> 14:56.979
but they haven't located Gangjae yet.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.648
Maybe they're getting help
from other organizations?

15:00.566 --> 15:01.442
No.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.904
Choi Mujin will act personally.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.742
But…

15:13.662 --> 15:15.539
they may be crumbling from within.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.540
What?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.669
I think one of them will flip for us.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.754
What…

15:21.837 --> 15:23.047
Who's that?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.131
I don't know yet.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.216
I'll meet him later.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.801
Pildo.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.470
Yes, sir.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.097
Later? When?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.724
Where are you meeting him?

15:36.810 --> 15:39.229
What should we do about Yamamoto?

15:40.105 --> 15:41.649
Tell him to wait for now.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.193
To build a new factory
and get new chemists,

15:44.276 --> 15:45.402
it'll take too long.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.863
The buyers are nervous too.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.531
You go to the buyers.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.200
Yes, sir.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.119
You said someone is circulating
a new drug.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.747
I bet that's Gangjae.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.460
He wants to kill me
and take over the market.

16:03.045 --> 16:03.963
So…

16:05.756 --> 16:08.592
if we get him, we also get his drugs.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.888
Yes, sir.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.233
A TRAITOR IS MEETING CHA GIHO.
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.255
It's hard for us to keep waiting.
That's what I'm saying.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.841
How long can we wait without drugs?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.552
Gangjae's gang is a problem,

16:52.177 --> 16:53.804
but even Narcotics is after you.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.807
Whose side should we take

16:57.975 --> 16:59.685
if a turf war breaks out?

17:01.103 --> 17:02.187
Are you saying

17:03.105 --> 17:04.940
you'll place bets on who wins?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.117
Fine. Do that then.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.870
But keep this in mind.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.080
The buy-in

17:21.081 --> 17:22.124
is your life.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.389
Keep watching them.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.432
Yes, sir.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.277
You seem to know who I am.
Let me see your…

22:07.242 --> 22:08.243
So,

22:09.036 --> 22:11.705
Choi Mujin really did plant someone
among us.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.583
Pildo.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.338
Keep a close eye on Detective Oh Hyejin.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.466
Ever since she came,

22:23.258 --> 22:24.926
our intel has been leaking.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.179
If she's their informant, that means

22:27.804 --> 22:30.140
they removed the cameras
as soon as she found out.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.101
Would they have risked blowing her cover?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.187
What if they did it because they knew

22:36.980 --> 22:38.023
we'd think that?

22:42.903 --> 22:43.904
Let's go.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.077
Go on.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.708
It was a trap.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.294
<i>Was Cha Giho trying to catch my informant?</i>

23:00.170 --> 23:01.129
But…

23:03.215 --> 23:05.258
Jung Taeju was there.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.689
<i>Don't do anything for the time being.</i>

23:20.315 --> 23:22.818
Cha Giho is waiting
for the organization to take action.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
I'll find Gangjae myself.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.831
I've calmed down the buyers for now.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.550
You may go.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.596
Yes, sir.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.330
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE GANGJAE IS
DONGMYO PARK 11 P.M.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.048
Pildo.

24:27.132 --> 24:27.966
Yes.

24:30.093 --> 24:31.553
It's Detective Oh's file.

24:32.679 --> 24:33.722
Captain.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.641
Why did you call out Jung Taeju?

24:38.852 --> 24:40.645
They planted a spy among us,

24:41.521 --> 24:43.023
so I just threw a stone.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.902
Let's see how far the ripples go.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.362
Keep it up.

24:49.946 --> 24:50.947
Good night, sir.

Is the ballistic report ready?

27:01.328 --> 27:03.705
Yes. I just notified your captain.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.626
To whom was the gun issued?

27:09.127 --> 27:12.630
We can't determine that here.
But we restored the gun's serial number.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.154
Why?

28:18.822 --> 28:19.739
Why now?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.325
He's probably trying to bait me

28:23.076 --> 28:25.245
since he thought it was a cop's gun.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.963
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
GUN SERIAL NUMBER ANALYSIS REPORT

28:45.807 --> 28:47.100
Who is Song Joonsu?

28:54.649 --> 28:56.276
We got the gun analysis report.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.070
I confirmed it with Administration.

29:03.491 --> 29:05.034
You picked it up?

29:06.202 --> 29:09.080
The gun was issued
to Corporal Song Joonsu in 2004.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.208
Records show he was with Narcotics.

29:13.877 --> 29:14.711
Who is he?

29:22.177 --> 29:23.678
He used to be on the team.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.474
He died less than a month
after joining Narcotics.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.478
Was Dongcheon involved?

29:36.816 --> 29:38.151
Dongcheon killed him.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.370
So the gun belonged to…

29:49.454 --> 29:50.914
NAME: SONG JOONSU
SERIAL: GL86575

29:51.498 --> 29:53.374
…the dead Narcotics agent
that Daesoo mentioned?

29:53.458 --> 29:55.710
DIED DURING OPERATION,
GUN WAS NOT RECOVERED

29:55.794 --> 29:59.005
SUPERVISOR IN CHARGE
NARCOTICS TEAM 1, LIEUTENANT CHA GIHO

30:29.619 --> 30:32.205
Did Dongcheon ever kill a cop?

30:34.415 --> 30:36.876
The gun belonged to a cop
who died long ago.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.338
Cha Giho says that cop was murdered
while following Dongcheon…

30:40.421 --> 30:41.506
That did not happen.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.425
The organization doesn't kill cops.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.804
Cha Giho has been after me for years

30:48.304 --> 30:49.931
and crossed the line years ago.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.017
He appeased, deceived, and entrapped us.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.061
He did anything he could.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.523
But now that the gun has surfaced,

30:59.732 --> 31:01.484
he's playing dirty tricks.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.863
Don't fall for it.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.540
I'm telling the truth.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.334
The cops took it all.

31:24.966 --> 31:25.967
You know,

31:27.302 --> 31:28.386
there aren't…

31:28.469 --> 31:29.596
Yes, Gangjae?

31:29.679 --> 31:30.680
…many people

31:31.681 --> 31:35.268
in this world that I like.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.228
I especially…

31:39.731 --> 31:42.567
can't stand assholes that lie.

31:44.485 --> 31:47.780
But who doesn't lie in this line of work?

31:47.864 --> 31:50.158
It's a world full of bad guys.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.997
if you're going to lie,

31:57.248 --> 31:59.250
-put more thought into it.
-That's not it, Gangjae…

32:04.756 --> 32:06.758
You need to show sincerity.

32:13.723 --> 32:14.891
SONG JOONSU DEATH REPORT

32:14.974 --> 32:17.018
HE WAS A CIVIL SERVANT.
WHILE TRACKING THE ROUTE OF

32:17.101 --> 32:20.063
DONGCHEON'S NEW DRUG,
HE FOUND AN IMPORTANT CLUE

32:20.146 --> 32:22.148
TO CHOI MUJIN.
AND DURING INVESTIGATION…

32:23.066 --> 32:24.192
What does it say?

32:25.151 --> 32:26.027
-Daesoo.
-Yes?

32:26.110 --> 32:27.779
Gangjae's and Mango's are the same.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.405
-LSD?
-Yes.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.323
Hold on.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.283
Goodness.

32:36.871 --> 32:38.206
Put it on my desk.

32:40.875 --> 32:41.960
Detective Oh.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.629
What are you doing later?

32:47.090 --> 32:48.174
Why?

32:49.133 --> 32:50.468
Want to grab some soju?

32:54.097 --> 32:55.473
I have plans.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.601
Okay, then.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.028
"Want to grab some soju?"

33:09.821 --> 33:11.614
Rejected! Gosh.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.533
She's not easy.

33:14.867 --> 33:16.452
Buy me soju instead!

33:17.537 --> 33:18.538
Geonpyeong.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.039
"Want to grab some whiskey?"

33:40.518 --> 33:43.187
Have you heard of Do Gangjae or his drugs?

34:59.889 --> 35:01.099
What are you doing here?

35:02.683 --> 35:04.519
And what are you doing here?

35:04.602 --> 35:05.520
Answer me.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.859
-I was watching Mango.
-Exactly. Why?

35:11.943 --> 35:15.488
The drugs found at the gym
and the ones Mango had are the same.

35:15.571 --> 35:16.572
I know that.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.993
I'm asking why you're on your own.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.624
Because dangerous assholes have
a new drug but no one is investigating.

35:29.752 --> 35:30.795
Is that really all?

35:50.273 --> 35:51.732
I'm going to find Gangjae.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.695
Act on your own again,
and you'll regret it.

35:56.904 --> 35:57.905
Go after him.

36:15.965 --> 36:16.966
Have a good night.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.968
-Thank you.
-Come again.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.309
Hi, you're here.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.944
You come often lately.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.862
Yes.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.281
-Spicy fish stew and soju?
-Yes, please.

36:51.876 --> 36:52.835
Yes?

36:54.503 --> 36:55.421
Okay.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.050
Beomya-ro 261.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.521
Okay.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.236
This factory shut down last month.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.333
Why are you trying so hard?

38:15.251 --> 38:17.378
You're tailing a druggie
on a Friday night.

38:17.878 --> 38:21.382
-Don't you have any friends?
-What about you?

38:28.848 --> 38:30.099
You're doing this

38:31.017 --> 38:32.310
because of your dad, right?

38:38.691 --> 38:39.942
Hello.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.529
I forgot my cigarettes.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.491
Would you go buy me a pack?

38:51.871 --> 38:52.872
Buy them please.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.685
Your dad was an addict, wasn't he?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.522
He was high when he was in that accident.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.443
You want to catch someone.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.154
Who is that?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.542
Why did he just give it to him?

40:24.672 --> 40:26.507
I don't see his thugs.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.802
You little shit.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.888
Where's Gangjae?

42:40.599 --> 42:42.184
Where's Do Gangjae?

43:02.121 --> 43:03.622
A fortune teller told me…

43:04.999 --> 43:06.000
that it was

43:06.834 --> 43:08.502
a very lucky year for me.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.632
This is from our security camera.
She suddenly showed up,

43:13.716 --> 43:15.259
beat up all my guys,

43:15.342 --> 43:16.594
and took all the drugs.

43:17.219 --> 43:18.554
That fucking narc.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.849
Stop whining about some narc.
Shut the hell up.

43:22.766 --> 43:23.684
What?

43:25.060 --> 43:26.520
What is it?

43:27.354 --> 43:28.230
Hey!

43:28.981 --> 43:30.149
It's the fucking bitch!

43:37.031 --> 43:37.865
Bang.

43:46.248 --> 43:47.207
Oh Hyejin.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.965
Detective Oh Hyejin.

44:02.556 --> 44:04.141
It's good to see you,

44:05.601 --> 44:07.227
you fucking bitch.
