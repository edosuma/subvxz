Previously on <i>The Secret Life</i>
<i>of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.760 --> 00:05.140
Now, you've made
a lot of positive changes

00:05.141 --> 00:06.505
in the past
couple of months.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.672
And the next
positive change is

00:07.707 --> 00:09.574
that I want to
get pregnant again.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.444
You're trying to have a
baby to save a marriage

00:12.478 --> 00:14.546
that you never really
wanted in the first place.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.681
I just want some time
alone with my husband.

00:16.716 --> 00:19.251
But we don't have room for her.
Where would she sleep?

00:19.285 --> 00:20.619
We can all stay
at my parents' house.

00:20.653 --> 00:24.589
I would like you to go
ahead, and move out.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.324
And what if you had
gotten pregnant again?

00:27.260 --> 00:28.360
I know.

00:28.394 --> 00:31.263
You and I, we're not
friends anymore. Fine.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.465
Look, I know what you're here for.
What am I here for?

00:33.499 --> 00:35.634
And you know what, you can't have him.
Just check his phone.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.569
Adrian is still in love
with Ricky.

00:37.603 --> 00:38.670
I feel a little relieved.

00:38.704 --> 00:40.472
Well, would you feel
relieved if we split up?

00:40.506 --> 00:43.375
Maybe I could rent
Ashley's room from you.

00:43.409 --> 00:44.609
Maybe I could live here.

00:44.644 --> 00:46.511
Are you hiding something?
I'm not hiding anything.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.347
Which doesn't mean that you don't
have messages from Adrian.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.782
Either you trust me,
or you don't.

00:50.817 --> 00:54.719
<i>Aren't you bored just talking to?</i>
<i> Good night, Ricky.</i>

00:54.754 --> 00:56.488
What are you doing?

01:01.394 --> 01:03.361
It's been a week.
A whole week.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.298
It may be longer. I don't want to
be with someone who can't trust me.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.632
I thought you trusted me.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.402
I do trust you. I do!

01:10.436 --> 01:12.404
That's why
I stood up for you,

01:12.438 --> 01:14.272
I stood up for you when Karlee accused
you of trying to sleep with her.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.507
And yet, you didn't
trust me enough

01:15.541 --> 01:17.476
to know that if I have
messages from Adrian,

01:17.510 --> 01:20.278
they don't mean anything, they
don't mean anything at all.

01:20.313 --> 01:23.348
They were meant to be a record so if
you ever questioned why she called,

01:23.382 --> 01:25.283
or what she said
or anything else,

01:25.318 --> 01:27.385
I'd have some evidence
that I've done nothing.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.489
Did you see that I didn't
reply to any of that stuff?

01:30.523 --> 01:34.426
Ricky, please? Please just let
me come back to the apartment.

01:35.561 --> 01:37.462
I'll see you at school.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.499
No, I can't take it anymore, I can't.
I just can't.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.434
I don't think
I can come to school.

01:42.468 --> 01:44.302
Dad's taking John
to the nursery.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.639
Someone's at my door.
I have to go.

01:47.673 --> 01:49.508
Who is it, Adrian?

01:49.542 --> 01:52.277
If it is Adrian, I didn't
invite her over here.

01:52.311 --> 01:53.645
Tell you what, hold on,
and I'll tell you.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.352
It's not Adrian.

02:01.654 --> 02:04.256
No, it's not Adrian,
it's me.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.459
Long time.
How'd you find me?

02:07.493 --> 02:10.529
Phone app.
Find Ricky. It's new.

02:10.562 --> 02:12.664
And why'd you
want to find me?

02:14.634 --> 02:16.434
I think I might be
getting arrested.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.669
Arrested for what, then?

02:17.703 --> 02:19.437
You better not be
doing drugs or drinking.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.605
'Cause if you're
doing that stuff,

02:20.640 --> 02:22.240
I can't help you.
I won't help you.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.409
No, that's not
the problem.

02:24.443 --> 02:27.312
Oh, God.
Sex with an underage girl?

02:27.346 --> 02:29.481
I'm underage.
And, no, it wasn't that.

02:29.515 --> 02:31.283
What is it?
I don't have a lot of time here,

02:31.317 --> 02:33.218
and I've got
problems of my own.

02:33.252 --> 02:35.587
I sent a picture of my girlfriend
out to everyone on my phone list.

02:35.621 --> 02:37.422
What's wrong with sending a
picture of your girlfriend

02:37.456 --> 02:39.224
to everyone
on your phone list?

02:39.258 --> 02:41.259
She was in
a state of undress.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.662
Huh? She didn't have
any clothes on. Any.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.597
Why would you share
a picture like that?

02:45.631 --> 02:50.569
She's hot. And she broke up
with me, and I was angry.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.271
That was a really stupid thing to do.
For her.

02:53.306 --> 02:56.274
For you. Those kind of photos get
out there, you can't get them back.

02:56.309 --> 02:59.277
Any time anyone puts her name
into a computer in the future,

02:59.312 --> 03:00.579
that photo you sent out
could pop up

03:00.613 --> 03:03.415
when she applies to college,
or for a job, or...

03:03.449 --> 03:05.183
This is serious.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.485
Yeah, I realize that.
Her father already had it out for me.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.187
Oh geez, Ethan.

03:09.222 --> 03:12.524
I know, I know.
So can you help me out?

03:12.558 --> 03:14.259
You gotta be
over 18 now,

03:14.293 --> 03:16.528
you could be
responsible for me.

03:16.562 --> 03:19.698
And I got to get someone to
be responsible for me, and...

03:21.500 --> 03:22.634
This is a nice place.

03:22.668 --> 03:25.270
Uh-uh.
I can't. I have a son.

03:25.304 --> 03:27.439
I'm sure you've heard.
I had a baby with my girlfriend.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.241
They live here.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.610
They live here? Doesn't look
like they live here. You sure?

03:31.644 --> 03:34.346
Yeah, go in the other room, there
are toys and a bed, and...

03:34.380 --> 03:36.348
It wouldn't matter, I can't
be responsible for you.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.317
I don't think the authorities would
even let me, and I just can't.

03:39.352 --> 03:42.520
I have to take care of Amy and John, and
I'm going to college next year, and...

03:42.555 --> 03:45.290
Man, whatever.
Don't worry about it.

03:46.626 --> 03:51.496
Just go with me to turn myself
in, that's all I'm asking.

03:51.530 --> 03:52.631
That's all, huh?

03:55.268 --> 03:58.470
I'll go with you, okay? I just
have to make a phone call first.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.572
I'm gonna call my mom and
see if she can do anything.

04:02.341 --> 04:04.242
Did you have breakfast?

04:04.277 --> 04:06.678
No, I haven't had breakfast,
not for most of my life.

04:07.647 --> 04:10.315
Been there.
I'll get you something.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.550
Yeah.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.187
No, we're fine with
you staying here,

04:16.221 --> 04:18.456
if that's okay with George,
it's okay with us.

04:19.659 --> 04:24.362
You look strange.
You look happy.

04:24.397 --> 04:25.497
I am happy.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.565
No, you're not
a happy person.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.634
Not normally. Normally,
you're very serious.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.303
Maybe you're getting
sick or something.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.504
No, I'm not
sick or something.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.506
And, yeah,
sometimes I am serious,

04:34.540 --> 04:36.341
but I am a happy person.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.609
When?

04:37.643 --> 04:39.644
When I'm not dealing with
other people's problems,

04:39.679 --> 04:44.349
when I can just relax and
enjoy my husband and my home.

04:44.383 --> 04:46.685
Nah, that's not it.
I'm going with sick or something.

04:46.719 --> 04:51.523
Or maybe you're getting that empty-nest
syndrome women your age get.

04:51.557 --> 04:55.727
Women my age, huh? Well, if I got
anything, it's whatever the opposite

04:55.761 --> 04:58.563
of the empty-nest
syndrome is.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.536
You gonna answer that?
Ricky.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.339
Oh, I'm not talking to him.
Why not?

05:07.373 --> 05:09.541
'Cause he's not being
very nice to Amy.

05:09.575 --> 05:12.344
Are you not being
very nice to Amy?

05:12.378 --> 05:13.645
Who told you that?

05:13.679 --> 05:16.548
How many times do
I have to say it?

05:16.582 --> 05:19.250
I'm being nice,
and I'm going to be nicer.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.619
I'm going to talk to her
when I get to school.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.323
But before I can get to school,
I have one little problem.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.292
Remember that kid who lived
with us for a while?

05:27.326 --> 05:31.229
Ethan? The one that
everyone is looking for,

05:31.263 --> 05:35.266
because of that sexting incident?
Is he there?

05:35.301 --> 05:37.635
He's not here, but I
could probably find him.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.604
I owe you.

05:39.638 --> 05:43.308
Ricky, don't get caught up in
this mess. He is in serious trouble.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.511
Now if you know where he
is, you better tell me.

05:46.545 --> 05:51.349
And get your ass over here and talk
to Amy. She's been crying for days.

05:53.652 --> 05:55.487
What is that about?

05:55.521 --> 05:56.588
They broke up.

So, according to the prenup,
you don't own the place,

06:17.939 --> 06:21.708
but my dad says that
you're out of college.

06:21.743 --> 06:24.711
Cable, utilities,
all that stuff included.

06:24.746 --> 06:25.946
That's not
in the prenup.

06:25.980 --> 06:28.849
I know, but my dad's feeling
very generous right now,

06:28.883 --> 06:31.184
and he knows that you'll be
starting college in the fall,

06:31.219 --> 06:36.056
and you can keep it, and everything in it
until you graduate.

06:36.858 --> 06:37.858
That's what he said.

06:38.092 --> 06:40.894
Wow. Uh...

06:42.897 --> 06:44.865
Do I have to give
you the ring back?

06:44.899 --> 06:47.734
No, you might want to move it
to the other hand,

06:47.769 --> 06:50.137
but, uh, no.
Keep the ring.

06:52.073 --> 06:55.042
So, friends?

06:56.010 --> 06:57.778
Sure.

06:59.113 --> 07:02.783
Even friends with benefits,
if you want.

07:02.817 --> 07:07.955
That's, uh, not an offer
I had anticipated,

07:09.724 --> 07:11.992
what with
with Ricky and all.

07:13.094 --> 07:15.862
But again, I loved you.

07:18.066 --> 07:21.735
And I loved you.
So...

07:23.738 --> 07:26.807
Who knows? Maybe some day
I'll take you up on that.

07:27.842 --> 07:28.909
How about today?

07:30.078 --> 07:32.112
We have to go to school.

07:35.083 --> 07:38.185
Come on, why would
you do that?

07:39.220 --> 07:40.821
You're in love with Ricky.

07:48.997 --> 07:52.245
Because we're friends,
and we're still married.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.212
We're married friends.

07:59.974 --> 08:02.809
So?
One for the road?

08:04.012 --> 08:05.946
I can't.

08:07.115 --> 08:08.949
We shouldn't.
Ah, why not?

08:13.154 --> 08:15.989
Amy, come on,
you have to go to school.

08:16.024 --> 08:17.589
Why do I have
to miss school.

08:18.188 --> 08:20.180
I can miss one day of school.

08:20.194 --> 08:22.162
I can't go to school
like this.

08:22.196 --> 08:24.898
Dad, I have been to school
every single day this week

08:24.932 --> 08:26.700
just to try to
talk to Ricky,

08:26.734 --> 08:29.136
and he still won't
talk to me, not really.

08:29.170 --> 08:32.806
He just wants more time
and more time.

08:33.941 --> 08:35.876
I screwed
everything up, Dad.

08:35.909 --> 08:37.144
You screwed
everything up?

08:37.178 --> 08:38.979
He's been hiding the fact that
Adrian's been calling him.

08:39.013 --> 08:40.847
He screwed
everything up.

08:40.881 --> 08:42.849
No, I had no right to check
his phone messages.

08:42.884 --> 08:44.985
No, you didn't,
but everyone does it.

08:45.953 --> 08:47.220
Everyone like who?

08:48.790 --> 08:50.757
I don't know.
Doesn't everyone?

08:50.792 --> 08:52.993
Do you?
Do I what?

08:53.027 --> 08:54.995
Do you sneak around and do you
listen to my phone messages,

08:55.029 --> 08:56.730
and Mom's and Ashley's?

08:56.764 --> 08:57.864
Your mom and your sister
aren't even here.

08:57.899 --> 09:00.700
You're not saying...
What? I pay the bill.

09:00.735 --> 09:03.837
Dad, I can't believe that you've
been listening to my phone messages!

09:03.871 --> 09:06.706
No, I haven't.
I don't know the password.

09:06.741 --> 09:08.008
But I mean the
text messages and emails,

09:08.042 --> 09:09.910
they're right there
on the phone.

09:09.944 --> 09:11.711
It hasn't happened
that many times.

09:11.746 --> 09:13.013
And, hey, you don't think Ricky
has ever checked your phone?

09:13.047 --> 09:14.748
Are you kidding?

09:14.782 --> 09:15.816
You think he hasn't done the
exact same thing you did?

09:16.150 --> 09:17.851
Why wouldn't he?

09:17.885 --> 09:20.887
Why would he? There's nothing on my
phone he'd be interested in.

09:20.922 --> 09:22.823
Besides, he's not
that kind of person.

09:22.857 --> 09:25.859
Yes, he is. Anyone can be that kind of
person under the wrong circumstances,

09:25.893 --> 09:27.694
or right... Whatever.

09:27.728 --> 09:29.096
No, not Ricky,
he wouldn't do that.

09:29.130 --> 09:32.833
Well, yes, he would do that.
He probably did do that. Ask him.

09:32.867 --> 09:36.036
No! He's already angry enough at me
without making him angrier.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.804
I'll ask him.

09:38.906 --> 09:42.008
You go to school,
I'll ask him.

09:42.043 --> 09:43.700
Why does anyone even have
emails or texts you wouldn't

09:43.725 --> 09:44.925
want anyone to look at?

09:45.079 --> 09:47.948
You know what they call emails and
texts in a courtroom? Evidence.

09:47.982 --> 09:50.117
Yeah.
Found out the hard way.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.188
Sure you don't want to take a
quick look just for reference?

09:55.223 --> 09:57.891
No. I don't.
How old is she?

09:57.925 --> 09:59.092
Sixteen.
How old are you?

09:59.127 --> 10:00.794
Fourteen,
but I'll be 15.

10:00.828 --> 10:03.063
I'll be in high school
next year, I hope.

10:03.097 --> 10:04.798
How long was this girl
your girlfriend?

10:04.832 --> 10:06.032
Three weeks.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.934
Oh, geez. She sent you
a picture like that when

10:07.969 --> 10:09.703
you'd only been
together three weeks?

10:09.737 --> 10:11.071
She sent it to me
the first week.

10:11.105 --> 10:13.974
You know, it's a status thing
to have a picture like that.

10:14.008 --> 10:15.909
She sent it to me
showing it to guys.

10:15.943 --> 10:18.812
Did she know you were
sending it to guys?

10:18.846 --> 10:21.715
I wasn't.
broke up with me.

10:21.749 --> 10:23.150
I was offended,
you know?

10:23.184 --> 10:24.718
You need some help.

10:24.752 --> 10:25.752
That's what I'm here for.

10:25.786 --> 10:27.787
Some professional help.

10:27.822 --> 10:29.990
As much as you get around,
you're like a professional.

10:30.024 --> 10:33.827
No, I'm not. And I've changed
a lot since you saw me.

10:33.861 --> 10:35.162
When did you last see me?

10:36.097 --> 10:38.832
Three years?

10:38.866 --> 10:41.134
What happened? Why'd you leave
our house? Refresh my memory.

10:41.169 --> 10:45.805
I stole something from the
house, a set of knives.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.209
Not steak knives, scalpels.
They belonged to the doctor.

10:49.243 --> 10:51.978
Oh, yeah,
I remember, antiques.

10:52.013 --> 10:53.780
What were you going
to do with scalpels?

10:53.814 --> 10:55.148
Are you kidding?
They were beautiful.

10:55.183 --> 10:57.050
I got hundred bucks
for them on the street.

10:57.084 --> 10:59.052
And what did you do
with the hundred bucks?

10:59.086 --> 11:00.187
Sneakers.

11:01.989 --> 11:03.890
They're gonna put
me in jail this time.

11:03.925 --> 11:05.225
You know they are.

11:05.259 --> 11:07.761
I don't know anything other than
you have to turn yourself in.

11:07.795 --> 11:10.764
If the cops are looking for you,
you have to turn yourself in.

11:10.798 --> 11:13.033
And you're still under 18, so,
hopefully, they won't put you in jail.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.741
Why aren't you at school?

11:21.776 --> 11:22.809
Why aren't you at school?

11:22.843 --> 11:24.177
I have a situation
I have to take care of.

11:24.212 --> 11:26.079
Oh, and what is that?

11:27.748 --> 11:28.882
Sorry.

11:28.916 --> 11:30.016
Get out here.

11:34.021 --> 11:35.088
Hey, she's hot.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:45.497 --> 11:47.365
Hey, wait up.

11:50.369 --> 11:52.170
I want to
apologize, okay?

11:52.204 --> 11:55.373
I admit I did call Grant and
Jack just to make you crazy.

11:56.308 --> 11:58.009
And I apologize.

12:00.212 --> 12:02.246
Well, at least you
didn't call Daniel.

12:06.151 --> 12:07.418
You didn't call Daniel?

12:09.355 --> 12:13.024
How did you even find him?
He's listed, geez.

12:13.058 --> 12:15.093
You would do that?
You would go after my new boyfriend?

12:15.127 --> 12:17.095
Well, there wasn't much point in
going after your old boyfriends,

12:17.129 --> 12:19.030
you don't really
care about them.

12:19.064 --> 12:22.033
And they turned me down.
Good.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.369
But I care about you, and I care
that you're just trying to hurt me.

12:24.403 --> 12:27.071
You told Amy that I was
trying to seduce Ben.

12:27.106 --> 12:28.940
That I was trying to trick him
into getting me pregnant.

12:28.974 --> 12:31.075
Yeah, well, you are,
or you were.

12:31.110 --> 12:32.343
No, I'm not.

12:32.378 --> 12:34.979
And Ben and I are
just friends now.

12:35.014 --> 12:36.914
Yeah, because now
you want Ricky back.

12:36.949 --> 12:38.950
And you told
Amy that, too.

12:38.984 --> 12:41.152
So what? You don't even care that
Amy has tried to be your friend.

12:41.186 --> 12:43.054
You're going after
Ricky anyway.

12:43.088 --> 12:44.989
I think that's horrible, Adrian,
that's really horrible.

12:45.024 --> 12:46.057
They have a son.

12:46.091 --> 12:49.327
Hey, hey, they broke up,
he's fair game.

12:49.361 --> 12:51.329
If not me,
it'll be someone else.

12:51.363 --> 12:53.231
What are you talking about?
They didn't break up.

12:55.167 --> 12:57.035
Where'd you hear that?
From Ricky.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.336
So you're talking to
Ricky?

12:58.370 --> 13:00.872
I talked to Ricky, yes.

13:00.906 --> 13:04.308
And, Amy is no longer
at the apartment.

13:04.343 --> 13:06.277
Well, that makes
me sad, really sad.

13:06.311 --> 13:08.846
It looked like everything was
going to work out for them.

13:08.881 --> 13:12.116
Yeah, it almost never does when two
teenagers have a baby together.

13:12.151 --> 13:16.854
But it could. It could if their friends
and family supported them, maybe.

13:16.889 --> 13:18.556
And that's the right thing
to do, don't you think?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.993
To support Amy and Ricky being together
as opposed to trying to break them up?

13:22.027 --> 13:24.162
I mean, it's difficult enough for them,
already, I'm sure, without someone

13:24.196 --> 13:26.898
intentionally trying
to break them up.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.052
You don't want to do
that, Adrian.

13:28.077 --> 13:29.915
You're really not that
type of person, are you?

13:30.936 --> 13:32.904
Maybe I am.

13:32.938 --> 13:37.075
'Cause, well, thinking about
being with him makes me happy.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.243
Yeah, but other things, other,
guys, could make you really happy

13:39.278 --> 13:42.313
if you're ready for that.

13:42.347 --> 13:46.284
Look, if I could get you a really,
really hot date, would you go out then?

13:46.318 --> 13:48.152
I mean, you and Ben, you're
not divorced yet, right?

13:48.187 --> 13:50.254
But do you guys have, like, a
agreement about that sort of thing?

13:51.924 --> 13:54.192
You're going to get
me a really hot date?

13:54.226 --> 13:56.260
Yes, Daniel has
friends, you know.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.963
And a really cute
one that lives upstairs.

13:58.997 --> 14:00.998
Does he look like Daniel?
Yeah.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.068
Then I'd definitely
be interested.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.918
Hey, Grace.

14:20.953 --> 14:21.953
Help.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.921
What kind of help
did you need?

14:23.956 --> 14:26.057
Well, first of all, I need you
to always be honest with me

14:26.091 --> 14:28.192
and tell me when
Adrian calls you.

14:28.227 --> 14:30.828
It's not something that I
wanted to text you about,

14:30.863 --> 14:32.130
and I haven't seen
you to tell you.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.931
Good excuse.

14:33.966 --> 14:37.135
Grace, I've had
finals all week.

14:37.169 --> 14:40.037
I'm a little crazy right
now.

14:40.072 --> 14:43.207
If it ever happens again, which I doubt
that it will because I've blocked

14:43.242 --> 14:47.245
her from my phone, I will tell you.
I'll text you right away.

14:49.047 --> 14:51.082
Really? You blocked her?
I blocked her.

14:51.116 --> 14:54.986
Well, you still should have told me and
since you didn't maybe you owe me?

14:55.020 --> 14:58.156
I don't know if I owe you,
but what'd you have in mind?

14:58.190 --> 15:00.224
Okay, we need to find
Adrian a date.

15:00.259 --> 15:02.760
Isn't she married?
No.

15:02.795 --> 15:03.861
<i>Yes, she is.</i>

15:03.896 --> 15:05.062
Not really, no.

15:05.097 --> 15:06.798
What does that mean?

15:06.832 --> 15:09.200
It means they're getting a divorce
and they have an agreement.

15:09.234 --> 15:12.770
Okay, well, still, I don't
want to play matchmaker.

15:12.805 --> 15:14.071
We have to find
Adrian a date.

15:14.106 --> 15:15.907
Otherwise, she's going
to go after Ricky

15:15.941 --> 15:17.809
and she's going to get hurt,
and I don't want that.

15:17.843 --> 15:19.911
I'm her friend, or I'm
trying to be her friend.

15:19.945 --> 15:21.145
Who would I fix her up
with?

15:21.180 --> 15:22.780
That guy upstairs.

15:22.815 --> 15:25.950
What guy upstairs?
There are 50 guys upstairs.

15:25.984 --> 15:27.952
Oh, no. No.
No. No, no, no.

15:27.986 --> 15:29.395
He's a player.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.736
A girl who just lost
a baby and is getting

15:30.761 --> 15:33.080
a divorce does not
need a player.

15:33.826 --> 15:36.861
She really doesn't even need
to be dating, does she?

15:36.895 --> 15:40.865
Well, she can handle a player,
she dated Ricky for years.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.867
I so don't want
to be involved in this.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.202
You're the one who told me
to try to be her friend.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.903
I'm trying to be her
friend.

15:45.938 --> 15:47.872
I'm trying not
to be her friend.

15:49.007 --> 15:50.107
Please?

15:51.310 --> 15:53.811
But Jesse is graduating
in a couple of weeks.

15:53.846 --> 15:55.246
Yeah, but I'm going
to graduation

15:55.280 --> 15:58.149
and all that other stuff
that graduates do.

15:58.183 --> 16:00.751
But he'll be going
away to school.

16:00.786 --> 16:02.153
He's coming back
here on the weekends,

16:02.187 --> 16:04.155
or I'll go there
on the weekends.

16:04.189 --> 16:05.790
I wish you would
have told me that

16:05.824 --> 16:06.991
you still wanted to get
back together with him.

16:07.025 --> 16:08.960
I've always wanted to get
back together with him.

16:08.994 --> 16:10.061
Yeah, but you
didn't say anything.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.162
And I broke up with Jack.

16:11.196 --> 16:14.165
That has nothing to do
with me and Jesse.

16:14.199 --> 16:15.967
Yes, it does.

16:16.001 --> 16:18.069
I would have just hung in there for a
couple of weeks until school was over

16:18.103 --> 16:20.071
and we could have done all
the senior stuff together.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.772
Jack broke up with you.

16:21.807 --> 16:24.075
Yes, but I accepted.
I wouldn't have accepted.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.209
Accepted what?

16:25.244 --> 16:27.144
Oh, hey, Amy,
how are you?

16:27.179 --> 16:29.814
Hey, we looked for you when we
got to school this morning.

16:29.848 --> 16:31.816
Yeah, I'm a little late,
I just got here.

16:31.850 --> 16:32.917
Are you okay?

16:32.951 --> 16:34.218
Um, no, not really.

16:34.253 --> 16:37.088
I went by Ricky's apartment
to see if we could talk,

16:37.122 --> 16:39.023
but there was
some kid over there,

16:39.057 --> 16:42.126
and he obviously cared more
about talking to him right now.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.061
Whose kid?
Yeah, whose kid?

16:44.096 --> 16:45.162
Does he have another kid?

16:45.197 --> 16:47.131
No, no, no, no, no.

16:47.165 --> 16:49.934
Just some kid who lived with him
when he was at his mother's house.

16:49.968 --> 16:53.037
His mother had other foster kids in
and out while Ricky was living there,

16:53.071 --> 16:55.873
and this one
just showed up.

16:55.908 --> 16:58.910
I wasn't even going to come in today
but I do want to talk to him.

16:58.944 --> 17:00.778
I want to ask him
something.

17:01.914 --> 17:04.749
If I can even get
him to talk to me.

17:04.782 --> 17:07.117
Do you guys think that Ricky's
ever looked through my phone?

17:07.152 --> 17:11.689
Ever checked my text messages or
emails or anything like that?

17:11.723 --> 17:12.924
Yes.

17:12.958 --> 17:15.026
What?
Everybody does it.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.060
And you're living
together.

17:17.095 --> 17:19.997
So, unless you've had your phone in your
possession every moment of every day,

17:20.031 --> 17:22.133
then I'm sure he has.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.968
Do you do that?
Either of you?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.903
Have you ever looked through
your boyfriend's phone

17:25.938 --> 17:27.070
without them
knowing about it?

17:27.105 --> 17:30.007
No. But Jesse and I
trust each other.

17:30.042 --> 17:31.876
Oh, come on.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.111
I've looked through
Jason's.

17:34.146 --> 17:35.947
You never looked
through Ashley's?

17:35.981 --> 17:37.181
No.

17:37.215 --> 17:39.750
You looked through
Jack's phone?

17:39.785 --> 17:43.154
Well, yes, and it wasn't
always easy, either.

17:43.188 --> 17:46.791
It was usually when he'd run into
some fast food place or something

17:46.825 --> 17:47.858
and leave it in the car.

17:47.893 --> 17:49.827
You're kidding me.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.964
Did you find anything
that, like, bothered you?

17:52.998 --> 17:55.166
No, he just sends
really dumb texts.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.767
Any texts to Grace?

17:56.802 --> 17:59.103
Yeah.
The dumbest texts of all.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.772
But the thing is,

18:01.807 --> 18:04.075
if you look at his
texts or emails,

18:04.109 --> 18:05.676
you can't say anything.

18:05.711 --> 18:06.777
No.

18:06.812 --> 18:08.145
Yeah, you have to come
up with some other way

18:08.180 --> 18:10.948
that you got the information
that you sneaked around to get,

18:10.983 --> 18:14.652
or at least say that
you got it somewherelse.

18:14.686 --> 18:18.122
Yeah, I'm really careful with
what I say in my texts or emails,

18:18.156 --> 18:21.058
especially after that
mis-mail to my dad that time.

18:21.093 --> 18:22.994
Am I the only one here
who feels guilty

18:23.028 --> 18:25.096
about looking through someone's
phone that's not mine?

18:25.130 --> 18:28.099
Probably.
But you are a good girl.

18:28.133 --> 18:29.900
Yeah. Always have been.

18:29.935 --> 18:31.102
I'm a teenage mother.

18:31.136 --> 18:34.939
Yeah, I bet that happens
mostly to good girls.

18:34.973 --> 18:36.040
Oh, hi, Amy.

18:37.142 --> 18:38.709
Girls.

18:40.112 --> 18:41.946
Hey, Adrian.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.848
I was looking for you.

18:43.882 --> 18:45.082
I heard about you and
Ricky.

18:45.117 --> 18:47.718
I'm so sorry.

18:47.753 --> 18:48.953
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:48.987 --> 18:50.688
Yeah, you do.

18:50.722 --> 18:53.991
So how long have you
been out, a week now?

18:54.893 --> 18:56.127
Just for your information,

18:56.161 --> 18:59.997
Ricky has a kid who needed
some help staying with him.

19:00.032 --> 19:01.699
He's not interested
in you anyway,

19:01.733 --> 19:02.733
whether I'm there or not.

19:03.035 --> 19:04.702
He might be.

19:04.736 --> 19:06.670
Especially when he
hears I'm dating again.

19:06.705 --> 19:09.874
What? Come on.
What do you mean?

19:09.908 --> 19:11.108
You're dating your
husband again?

19:11.143 --> 19:13.044
You're going out
with Ben again?

19:13.078 --> 19:16.881
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not Ben. Other guys.

19:16.915 --> 19:19.784
Guys that Ricky
would be jealous of.

19:19.818 --> 19:22.653
Guys that are in college.

19:22.687 --> 19:24.688
Guys that Grace's boyfriend
thinks I should meet.

19:24.723 --> 19:25.823
You know, so I can
get out of high school,

19:25.857 --> 19:27.691
and try out a whole
new playing field.

19:27.726 --> 19:30.895
Oh, uh, by the way,

19:30.929 --> 19:32.830
you listened to my
phone messages?

19:32.864 --> 19:36.033
So what? You never listened to
any of Ben's phone messages?

19:36.068 --> 19:38.869
Never checked any of his
text messages or emails?

19:38.904 --> 19:39.904
Of course not.

19:40.839 --> 19:41.839
You're lying.

19:43.075 --> 19:45.109
I think.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.079
Well, we'll never
know, will we?

19:48.113 --> 19:52.850
Because if I ever did do something so
unscrupulous as to check Ben's phone,

19:52.884 --> 19:54.885
well, I definitely
didn't get caught.

20:03.254 --> 20:05.076
It's child pornography?

20:05.635 --> 20:07.569
Child pornography?

20:07.603 --> 20:09.471
You saw the picture.

20:09.505 --> 20:10.539
She's a minor.

20:10.573 --> 20:12.641
She's a child.
She's my child,

20:12.675 --> 20:14.776
and you sent around
pictures of her, naked.

20:14.811 --> 20:16.545
She's 16.

20:16.579 --> 20:18.513
She knew what she was doing
when she sent me that picture.

20:18.548 --> 20:19.815
So you didn't take
the picture?

20:19.849 --> 20:21.349
Who took the picture?

20:21.384 --> 20:23.451
She took the picture.

20:23.486 --> 20:27.622
So anyway, the problem
is that you forwarded the photo.

20:27.657 --> 20:29.624
That's distributing
child pornography.

20:30.526 --> 20:33.795
Again, she is not a child.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.463
She is not, sir.

20:35.498 --> 20:37.666
And she doesn't even care
that I sent it around.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.635
I mean, yeah, other guys'
girlfriends have gotten upset,

20:40.670 --> 20:43.638
but they're not like her.

20:43.673 --> 20:46.608
Are you kidding me?
She's devastated.

20:46.642 --> 20:49.477
She's devastated you saw
it and found out about it.

20:49.512 --> 20:50.512
She wanted me to...

20:51.747 --> 20:53.682
Okay, maybe not wanted,

20:53.716 --> 20:56.351
but she doesn't care if
people see the photo.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.719
She considers it art.

20:57.753 --> 20:58.753
Oh, my...

20:58.788 --> 21:00.689
And she's very...

21:00.723 --> 21:02.591
You know,
she has a lot of...

21:05.595 --> 21:07.562
Confidence.
Okay, look, you little loser,

21:07.597 --> 21:10.699
you can't send naked pictures of my
daughter around to half the school

21:10.733 --> 21:12.334
and not go to jail for it.

21:13.369 --> 21:15.470
Uh...

21:15.504 --> 21:18.640
Ethan, you want
to step back outside?

21:18.674 --> 21:19.774
Certainly.

21:32.521 --> 21:33.788
What happened to the dude?

21:33.823 --> 21:35.390
The dude...

21:36.626 --> 21:39.527
...is in school.
I sent him back to school.

21:39.562 --> 21:41.529
You're still telling
him what to do?

21:41.564 --> 21:42.764
He's 18.

21:42.798 --> 21:44.799
I'm going to be telling him
what to do until he's 40.

21:44.834 --> 21:46.735
Maybe longer.

21:46.769 --> 21:48.770
Lucky him.

21:48.804 --> 21:52.507
So you tired of
getting in trouble yet?

21:52.541 --> 21:53.808
You know, I don't know
what the big deal is.

21:53.843 --> 21:56.478
The big deal is you
broke the law again.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.747
Let me ask you something.

21:58.781 --> 22:02.317
Were those new sneakers worth
getting taken out of our house?

22:04.654 --> 22:06.655
No.

22:06.689 --> 22:08.623
Guy stole 'em from
me two weeks later.

22:16.365 --> 22:18.600
They actually let you
have your phone back?

22:33.716 --> 22:36.384
You're back up.
Let's go.

22:53.536 --> 22:55.470
Um...

22:55.504 --> 22:58.373
Do you ever

22:58.407 --> 23:02.610
pick up your kids' phones and
check out the messages on them?

23:02.645 --> 23:05.246
Who's asking, you, or did
one of my kids complain?

23:05.281 --> 23:06.548
No, it's me. It's just me.

23:06.582 --> 23:08.717
I just know someone
that that happened to.

23:08.751 --> 23:10.618
Is that why those
two are upset?

23:10.653 --> 23:12.487
He got nosy with her
phone?

23:12.521 --> 23:13.621
No, the other way around.

23:13.656 --> 23:15.323
Oh, geez.

23:15.358 --> 23:16.725
Oh, let me guess.

23:16.759 --> 23:19.361
Messages from Adrian?

23:19.395 --> 23:22.397
Yeah. And Amy got
caught listening to them.

23:22.431 --> 23:23.698
How'd she get the
password?

23:23.733 --> 23:25.533
It was "John."

23:25.568 --> 23:30.372
They all pick stupid
passwords, if left to themselves.

23:30.406 --> 23:32.273
My daughters and
I have an agreement.

23:32.308 --> 23:35.477
I have full access to
anything on their phones

23:35.511 --> 23:37.679
and the passwords
to check the phones.

23:37.713 --> 23:40.348
And once a week
I do check them.

23:40.383 --> 23:42.717
Never on the same day,
never the same time.

23:42.752 --> 23:45.687
Cuts down on any
of the phone crap.

23:45.721 --> 23:48.289
Have you ever seen
pictures of my daughters?

23:48.324 --> 23:50.392
No.
There's a reason for that.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.327
What's the reason?

23:53.696 --> 23:56.331
They're hot.

23:56.365 --> 23:58.500
And they don't need to be advertised
around this joint with the two hounds

23:59.635 --> 24:01.302
I'm sorry.

24:01.337 --> 24:03.238
I forgot that one
of them is your son.

24:04.306 --> 24:06.274
So, you have
hot daughters, huh?

24:06.308 --> 24:07.609
Like that's a surprise.

24:08.711 --> 24:12.247
It's a blessing
and a curse.

24:12.281 --> 24:15.250
I have got them in
all-girls private schools

24:15.284 --> 24:17.385
and I'm going to keep them in
an all-girls private school

24:17.420 --> 24:20.221
until they've got PhDs.

24:20.256 --> 24:21.556
That's gonna make
'em gay, you know.

24:22.391 --> 24:23.558
I'm kidding.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.461
Not that I would mind.

24:26.495 --> 24:28.430
I might prefer that.

24:28.464 --> 24:31.266
Cut down on the chance for some
guy to do something stupid

24:31.300 --> 24:32.367
and get one of them...

24:33.669 --> 24:35.503
Again, I'm sorry.

24:35.538 --> 24:37.639
Oh, apology accepted.

24:37.673 --> 24:40.542
I know it's not the best thing that
happened to Ricky and Amy and John,

24:40.576 --> 24:43.278
but it's not like nothing
good came of it.

24:43.679 --> 24:45.213
Ladies.

24:45.247 --> 24:46.347
Oh. Hi.

24:48.684 --> 24:52.487
Right, I haven't seen you since
I fired you from the office.

24:52.521 --> 24:53.655
Sorry about that, Bunny.

24:54.690 --> 24:56.291
And what about me?

24:56.725 --> 24:58.226
You I have to talk to.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.228
Because?

25:00.262 --> 25:02.397
I guess folks
are going to know.

25:03.499 --> 25:05.433
Betty and I are splitting
up.

25:05.468 --> 25:07.535
Oh, what happened?

25:07.570 --> 25:08.636
She wants
to go to college.

25:13.476 --> 25:15.510
Oh, you're not joking.

25:16.378 --> 25:18.246
No, I'm not.

25:18.280 --> 25:22.383
And that would break up two people if
one of them wanted to go to college?

25:22.418 --> 25:26.554
It just didn't work out. We decided
we'll be happier not married,

25:26.589 --> 25:30.225
and that's that.
It's nobody's business.

25:30.259 --> 25:33.394
No one asked, you volunteered.
I mean, just for the record.

25:33.429 --> 25:38.233
Just in case you want to use that to fire
me from here or, you know, anything.

25:42.371 --> 25:44.472
I, on the other hand,
never hold a grudge.

25:44.507 --> 25:47.575
I completely and totally
understand why I got fired.

25:47.610 --> 25:50.178
And why is that?

25:50.212 --> 25:53.414
Can't be trusted.
Can't be trusted staying sober,

25:53.449 --> 25:56.317
can't be trusted with
anything else. No?

25:56.352 --> 25:59.454
Well, yeah, but that's what
I imagine you're thinking.

25:59.488 --> 26:01.422
That's not what I'm thinking.
What I'm thinking is that

26:01.457 --> 26:04.192
everyone deserves
a second chance, everyone.

26:04.226 --> 26:06.461
What about Bunny?
No.

26:06.495 --> 26:10.465
Oh, well, actually, I think
this would be my third chance,

26:10.499 --> 26:13.434
my second chance
was being here.

26:14.603 --> 26:18.473
Okay, a third chance.
I want you back.

26:18.507 --> 26:20.341
I don't deserve
a third chance.

26:22.178 --> 26:23.178
I'll take it.

26:27.616 --> 26:29.317
Hey.

26:29.351 --> 26:33.254
Hey, um,
I want to talk to you,

26:33.289 --> 26:35.356
but I have to go to the
counselor's office immediately.

26:35.391 --> 26:38.293
I don't know what she wants, but she
said immediately, so I have to go.

26:38.327 --> 26:41.496
No, you don't. I got that Joe guy
to give your teacher the note.

26:41.530 --> 26:44.165
It cost me 20 bucks.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.568
Really? So I don't have to go...
No.

26:46.602 --> 26:49.237
I just got here
and I felt bad that

26:49.271 --> 26:51.606
you dropped by and I had
something else going on,

26:51.640 --> 26:53.541
but maybe you shouldn't
have dropped by.

26:53.576 --> 26:55.476
I told you I'd talk to
you when I saw you.

26:55.511 --> 26:57.278
Yet you have time
to talk to Adrian.

26:57.313 --> 26:58.546
At least that's
what she says.

26:58.581 --> 27:01.216
I did talk to her, Amy.
I told her what happened,

27:01.250 --> 27:04.552
and I asked her to please not
call, or text, or email me again.

27:04.587 --> 27:07.422
Oh, so she texts you
and emails you, too?

27:07.456 --> 27:10.191
She's not just calling and
leaving you seductive messages?

27:10.226 --> 27:12.193
You thought she'd call
but not text or email?

27:12.228 --> 27:13.561
No one emails!

27:13.596 --> 27:16.197
Whatever. She won't do
any of that stuff again,

27:16.232 --> 27:18.166
not that that
resolves our issues.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.602
Yes, she will, she's
not going to give up.

27:20.636 --> 27:23.538
You know, she's even going to try to
make you jealous by going out on a date.

27:23.572 --> 27:26.140
I know,
she texted me.

27:26.175 --> 27:28.343
If I don't respond,
eventually she'll stop.

27:28.377 --> 27:29.544
And have you responded?

27:29.578 --> 27:31.579
I can't stop her.
I can only stop myself.

27:31.614 --> 27:33.581
And I don't care who
she's going out with.

27:33.616 --> 27:35.450
I mean, who's she
going out with? Ben?

27:35.484 --> 27:38.253
No. Someone new.
Somebody that Grace's new boyfriend

27:38.287 --> 27:39.354
is fixing her up with.

27:41.624 --> 27:43.458
I saw that.
Saw what?

27:43.492 --> 27:45.293
It does bother you.

27:45.327 --> 27:47.428
You're going to go there again
after what I just said?

27:47.463 --> 27:50.498
Are you ever going to believe me when
I say I'm not interested in Adrian,

27:50.532 --> 27:53.568
or are you always going to be sneaking
around to see if you can catch me

27:53.602 --> 27:56.337
picking up my phone or listening
in on my conversations

27:56.372 --> 27:57.438
and all that stuff.

27:57.473 --> 27:59.374
Let me ask
you something, Ricky.

27:59.408 --> 28:03.244
You ever pick up my phone, check
my messages, my emails, my texts?

28:05.314 --> 28:08.516
Aha! So you've done the same thing
to me that I've done to you

28:08.550 --> 28:10.285
only you
didn't get caught.

28:10.319 --> 28:13.087
And there's nothing on my phone
that would even bother you.

28:13.122 --> 28:15.156
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

28:15.190 --> 28:18.393
We just can't trust each other.
Why even try?

28:28.319 --> 28:30.587
This isn't what I wanted
to be doing tonight.

28:30.758 --> 28:33.526
Well, she's on
the way over, so...

28:33.561 --> 28:36.362
So what? I just got finished
with my last final,

28:36.397 --> 28:40.400
and I was just going to see if you
want to come over and celebrate.

28:40.434 --> 28:43.436
Sure. But the more,
the merrier, right?

28:43.471 --> 28:47.440
Grace, come on. Tell her I couldn't
get in touch with him,

28:47.475 --> 28:50.510
tell her he has
a girlfriend or something.

28:50.544 --> 28:52.445
But that would be a lie.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.783
Well, kind of. Come on,
I promise. I'll find her a date.

28:56.817 --> 29:00.386
No. It has to be the date I found.
It has to be...

29:00.421 --> 29:01.454
What's his name?

29:01.489 --> 29:03.523
Dante?
<i>Yes, Dante.</i>

29:03.557 --> 29:06.493
Just come over, we'll talk
about it, we'll talk to him,

29:06.527 --> 29:09.729
see if he's even interested and
we can get a little alone time.

29:10.765 --> 29:13.399
Okay.
Okay, then.

29:13.434 --> 29:16.336
<i>I'll just ask Adrian to drop me</i>
<i>off so you can drive me home.</i>

29:16.370 --> 29:19.472
And if he happens to be at your
apartment when she drops me off, then,

29:19.507 --> 29:21.474
that would be great.

29:24.745 --> 29:28.515
It's T-bone. He'll come over for that.
You can thank me later.

29:28.549 --> 29:31.351
Wait, what? No.
I don't want him to come over.

29:31.385 --> 29:32.585
You've been wanting him
to come over all week.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.354
Nora brought home steaks
from the butcher shop

29:34.388 --> 29:35.622
so you would have
a reason to call him.

29:35.656 --> 29:36.656
Call him.

29:38.459 --> 29:40.326
Come on, Ames,
I'm doing this for you.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.561
No, you're not.
You're doing this

29:41.595 --> 29:43.496
so I won't be annoyed with
you for looking at my phone.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.764
I'm not gonna call him.

29:44.799 --> 29:47.433
He has looked at your phone,
hasn't he? You asked him?

29:47.468 --> 29:50.637
Yeah, I asked him,
and no, he hasn't,

29:50.671 --> 29:52.705
so thanks for the
suggestion.

29:52.740 --> 29:55.675
Oh, he's just not admitting it.
I'm going to call him.

29:55.709 --> 29:57.777
You may not be crying
now, but I know you,

29:57.812 --> 30:00.480
and there's going to be crying until
we get this whole thing wrapped up,

30:00.514 --> 30:02.749
so just call him.

30:02.783 --> 30:06.352
By the way, did you tell Mom
that Nora is living here

30:06.387 --> 30:08.521
or am I just supposed
to be hiding that?

30:08.556 --> 30:10.557
Why would I tell Mom
that Nora is living here?

30:10.591 --> 30:12.458
Because she owns the
house.

30:12.493 --> 30:13.693
I have the house until you and
Ashley graduate high school,

30:13.727 --> 30:15.428
and I'm done raising you.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.832
There better be something funny
in that textbook, young lady.

30:19.733 --> 30:21.534
There isn't.

30:21.569 --> 30:22.802
Then what's so funny, that
I'm raising you and Ashley?

30:24.471 --> 30:26.439
Dad, do you even know
where Ashley is?

30:26.473 --> 30:27.607
Yes, I know
where Ashley is.

30:27.641 --> 30:28.808
I talk to her every day.
And we text.

30:28.843 --> 30:31.811
We text and text and text.
You can check my phone.

30:31.846 --> 30:33.313
And where is she?

30:33.347 --> 30:34.614
She's in Florida.

30:34.648 --> 30:36.482
No, I knew that, I meant
where is she tonight?

30:36.517 --> 30:38.451
She and her friend are
starting a new job tonight.

30:38.485 --> 30:40.453
Uh-huh.
What kind of job?

30:40.487 --> 30:42.555
Some sort of
medical assistant.

30:42.590 --> 30:47.694
Yeah, what is Ashley qualified to
assist with in the medical field?

30:47.728 --> 30:50.763
I don't know, I didn't hire her,
but she's a very smart girl.

30:50.798 --> 30:54.534
Mmm-hmm. Smart enough
to get out of this house.

30:54.568 --> 30:56.469
I thought
you liked the house.

30:56.503 --> 30:58.338
You liked the house when
it was you and Ricky here.

30:58.372 --> 30:59.505
What is it you don't
like about it now?

31:02.743 --> 31:05.712
Oh, of course, me.

31:05.746 --> 31:07.480
I've gotten that before.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.824
Ashley, this experimental
test program is for people

31:17.858 --> 31:20.560
who have depression.
I'm not depressed.

31:20.594 --> 31:21.828
I've been
depressed before.

31:21.862 --> 31:23.696
You're jaded,
not depressed.

31:23.731 --> 31:27.500
Well, they're paying $500.
I could be depressed for $500.

31:27.534 --> 31:28.668
I guess I could be, too.

31:28.702 --> 31:30.436
Let's at least find out
what it's about.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.608
"This medication could
cause irregular heartbeat,

31:35.643 --> 31:38.678
"liver failure or could
even result in death..."

31:42.750 --> 31:44.684
I'm out.

31:48.589 --> 31:49.622
Feeling better.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.460
Ta-da!

31:55.596 --> 31:57.463
We walked
all around the block.

31:57.498 --> 32:00.366
I mean, the entire block.

32:00.401 --> 32:04.404
And John let me
hold his hand... Well...

32:04.738 --> 32:06.572
Hey, buddy.

32:06.607 --> 32:09.642
It's been such a good day for me.
I'm so happy.

32:09.677 --> 32:13.379
I've got a place to live
and a new job,

32:14.581 --> 32:17.450
and you and John,

32:18.519 --> 32:19.552
and your dad,

32:21.588 --> 32:22.655
and Ricky.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.358
Can't we call Ricky?

32:25.392 --> 32:26.459
Can't we please, Amy?

32:26.493 --> 32:27.627
Hi, Daddy.

32:29.630 --> 32:33.333
No, no! He doesn't trust me
and I don't trust him, and...

32:33.367 --> 32:34.701
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

32:34.735 --> 32:37.704
Or even a third.
That's what Leo says.

32:37.738 --> 32:40.473
Even if I call Ricky, it doesn't
mean he's going to come over here.

32:40.507 --> 32:42.642
You won't know
until you try.

32:42.676 --> 32:45.445
Why don't you call him?
It's your celebration.

32:48.615 --> 32:49.749
I don't want
to wait outside,

32:49.783 --> 32:51.784
I don't want to
play games, okay?

32:51.819 --> 32:55.521
Hey, John,
good to see you, buddy.

32:55.556 --> 32:58.391
Why don't you get Grandma to
play with you and Moose outside?

32:58.425 --> 32:59.425
Okay.

33:13.774 --> 33:17.643
I lied.
I've looked at your phone before.

33:17.678 --> 33:19.345
A couple of times.

33:19.380 --> 33:20.813
Not that it was worth
compromising my integrity for

33:20.848 --> 33:24.584
by looking at it
or lying about it.

33:24.618 --> 33:27.553
But I guess we were both wrong
not to trust each other.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.590
I just don't know how we do that if
we really don't trust each other.

33:30.624 --> 33:32.625
You don't trust me?

33:32.659 --> 33:34.727
That's just an excuse for not
wanting to be with me, Ricky.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.729
You know you can trust me.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.499
You know what?
You can just go home, okay?

33:39.533 --> 33:42.301
You don't get a T-bone steak
for this conversation.

33:42.336 --> 33:44.604
You can go home, and you can try and
figure out how we can live together,

33:44.638 --> 33:46.606
and still not be perfect.
Good night.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.374
Oh, no,
I'm getting a steak.

33:48.409 --> 33:50.576
I might eat it outside,
but I'm getting a steak.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.353
So?

34:00.387 --> 34:02.321
So it went nowhere.
She wants me to go home.

34:02.356 --> 34:04.457
But I'm hungry.
And you invited me to eat,

34:04.491 --> 34:06.426
so I'm eating,
then I'll leave.

34:06.460 --> 34:07.693
You know what
the problem is?

34:07.728 --> 34:09.462
The problem is
you're not married.

34:09.496 --> 34:11.731
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe your
problem is you're not married.

34:11.764 --> 34:13.599
Both parties have to want to
be married to be married.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.400
My ex-wife does not
want to be married.

34:15.436 --> 34:16.469
Does your girlfriend
want to be married?

34:17.804 --> 34:19.539
Do you want to be married?

34:19.572 --> 34:20.639
I just want to eat.

34:22.376 --> 34:23.609
Yes. Just not now.

34:24.710 --> 34:26.579
I know, I know.

34:31.376 --> 34:33.543
Well...
There's always going to be children

34:33.578 --> 34:35.379
who need your help,

34:35.413 --> 34:37.313
and you're always going to want
to help them, so...

34:37.348 --> 34:38.415
What can I say?

34:38.449 --> 34:42.286
Well, you can say no.
I can even say no.

34:43.388 --> 34:46.223
Since when, Margaret?
You're you.

34:46.257 --> 34:47.324
Should we go get him?

34:47.358 --> 34:50.360
Well, we can't
just go and get him.

34:50.395 --> 34:52.462
Unfortunately,
he has to go to court.

34:52.496 --> 34:55.232
Until then,
he's gonna be in juvie.

34:55.266 --> 34:57.200
Now, Ruben's trying
to work a deal.

34:57.235 --> 34:58.368
This is a serious offense,

34:58.403 --> 34:59.436
you can't send just go

34:59.470 --> 35:02.339
sending naked pictures
of people around,

35:02.373 --> 35:04.441
unless you're
both over 18,

35:04.475 --> 35:06.476
and then apparently
it's not a legal issue.

35:06.511 --> 35:08.345
But it should be.

35:08.379 --> 35:10.314
Maybe, maybe not.

35:12.450 --> 35:14.418
You text me a picture and
I'll text you one.

35:15.586 --> 35:17.220
Is that a yes?

35:20.358 --> 35:21.358
Nice ring.

35:21.392 --> 35:24.428
Oh, yeah.
It was my engagement ring.

35:25.396 --> 35:26.396
Oh, no.

35:26.431 --> 35:27.331
What, you're engaged?

35:27.365 --> 35:28.365
Well, right now, I'm
married.

35:29.367 --> 35:30.367
Interesting.

35:30.401 --> 35:33.403
Yeah, he just moved out.

35:33.438 --> 35:35.305
But you're still married?

35:35.340 --> 35:38.108
Yeah.
Well, we're getting a divorce.

35:38.142 --> 35:39.276
So, you...

35:39.310 --> 35:41.144
Don't have children.

35:41.179 --> 35:42.279
You guys want
something to eat or...

35:42.313 --> 35:43.413
You're still in
high school, right?

35:43.448 --> 35:46.116
Yeah, but I'm a year
older than Grace.

35:46.150 --> 35:47.217
I'm graduating
after summer school

35:47.251 --> 35:48.352
and then
I'm going to college.

35:50.221 --> 35:51.488
So why the divorce?

35:51.522 --> 35:55.192
Well, I'm kind of in love
with my old boyfriend,

35:55.226 --> 35:56.326
but he and this girl
had a baby

35:56.361 --> 35:58.261
and they were
living together,

35:58.296 --> 36:03.266
but they just split up and I think I
might want to try being with him again.

36:03.301 --> 36:05.135
Uh-huh.

36:05.169 --> 36:07.270
Maybe we should have given
them both a list of topics.

36:07.305 --> 36:08.505
I don't think she
actually dated that much.

36:08.539 --> 36:12.309
You know what,
I like your honesty.

36:13.211 --> 36:15.145
I really do.

36:15.179 --> 36:17.347
But if you're trying to get
back with your old boyfriend,

36:17.382 --> 36:19.149
what are you
doing here with me?

36:19.183 --> 36:21.184
Uh, I don't know.

36:22.353 --> 36:24.521
I thought it would
make him jealous,

36:25.356 --> 36:27.391
and I was curious.

36:28.393 --> 36:30.060
About?

36:30.094 --> 36:32.062
About whether or not Grace
actually knows any hot guys,

36:32.096 --> 36:33.363
besides that one.

36:33.398 --> 36:35.232
You know you can tell what
a person thinks about you

36:35.266 --> 36:37.200
by who they try
to fix you up with?

36:37.235 --> 36:39.236
You think so?
Yeah, I think so.

36:39.270 --> 36:41.271
All right, well, um,

36:41.305 --> 36:44.207
what do you think
people think about you?

36:44.242 --> 36:45.308
Well, they think
I'm good looking,

36:45.343 --> 36:48.278
because you're good looking.
Hmm?

36:48.312 --> 36:51.248
And they think I'm smart,
because you're smart,

36:52.250 --> 36:54.451
and they think I'm sexy,

36:54.485 --> 36:57.320
because, uh,
well, you are sexy.

36:59.223 --> 37:01.224
You know what, your
self-esteem is pretty high

37:01.259 --> 37:03.326
for someone going through a
divorce so early in life.

37:03.361 --> 37:05.328
Yeah, it is.

37:05.363 --> 37:08.298
That's why even though my old boyfriend
and this girl have a baby together,

37:08.332 --> 37:11.134
I still think
I can get him back.

37:11.169 --> 37:15.272
Not that I'm totally sure
I want him back.

37:15.306 --> 37:17.407
She'd take him away
from Amy just to see?

37:17.442 --> 37:19.342
We're trying to have
a conversation here.

37:20.378 --> 37:22.379
So, what's your story?

37:24.382 --> 37:26.550
Well, I've been
married three times

37:27.485 --> 37:30.220
and I got nine kids.

37:32.190 --> 37:33.256
Really?
No, I'm playing.

37:33.291 --> 37:34.458
I don't have nine kids.

37:34.492 --> 37:36.159
I was just trying
to top your story.

37:36.194 --> 37:37.360
Oh, yeah,
that's difficult to do.

37:37.395 --> 37:40.464
Yeah. Uh, no, actually, I'm
a sophomore in college,

37:40.498 --> 37:42.265
my brother's a senior.

37:42.300 --> 37:46.269
We live upstairs and I
got a full scholarship.

37:46.304 --> 37:48.405
The wildest thing
I've ever done?

37:48.439 --> 37:51.208
I don't know,
a couple of tattoos.

37:51.242 --> 37:53.276
Oh, I'd like
to get a tattoo.

37:53.311 --> 37:55.212
Tonight?
No!

37:55.246 --> 37:58.281
No, I don't even have one picked
out yet, or a place to get it.

37:58.316 --> 38:00.183
Oh, 'cause, I an, I was going
to take you to my guy.

38:00.218 --> 38:03.086
He does some really,
really good work.

38:03.121 --> 38:05.155
Oh, um, when I said
I don't have a place,

38:05.189 --> 38:07.324
uh, I meant on me.

38:07.358 --> 38:08.492
I don't know
where I'd put one.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.095
Oh, uh,

38:12.130 --> 38:15.232
well, uh, how about
we get up out of here,

38:15.266 --> 38:17.200
so I can get a better look
at the canvas, huh?

38:17.502 --> 38:19.169
All right.

38:21.305 --> 38:24.207
You guys,
tattoos last a lifetime!

38:27.345 --> 38:29.246
Nice work, Grace.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.082
At least it'll keep her
away from Ricky.

38:32.116 --> 38:34.251
Amy and Ricky
got into a big fight.

38:34.285 --> 38:36.253
Amy checked his phone out
and he caught her.

38:36.287 --> 38:40.257
Really? You can check
my phone out any time you want.

38:41.425 --> 38:44.194
No, it's okay,
I trust you.

38:44.228 --> 38:45.295
Do you?

38:45.329 --> 38:47.264
Or do you just not want
me to see your phone?

38:48.332 --> 38:50.200
No!

38:50.234 --> 38:54.171
No, you can see my phone,
if you really want to.

38:54.205 --> 38:55.438
It's okay with me.

39:07.318 --> 39:08.318
It's no one.

39:10.321 --> 39:12.455
Tell no one I said hi.

39:12.490 --> 39:16.359
It's Ethan. He's stuck in some juvie
hall room with some other idiot.

39:16.394 --> 39:18.295
All right, can we just
talk about this?

39:18.329 --> 39:20.263
Yeah, I've been trying to
talk to you for a week now.

39:20.298 --> 39:24.334
Yeah, I let this go on
way too long because,

39:24.368 --> 39:26.236
Amy, all my life,
no one has trusted me,

39:26.270 --> 39:29.206
and all my life
I wasn't trustworthy.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.208
I think I've earned
the right to be trusted.

39:31.242 --> 39:32.475
It would be easier for
me to trust you, Ricky,

39:32.510 --> 39:35.145
if you had just said, "Hey, you
want to listen to this message

39:35.179 --> 39:36.446
"I just got from Adrian?"

39:36.480 --> 39:39.049
instead of not saying anything or
saying you had listened to it,

39:39.083 --> 39:41.384
and then you erased it.
That was a lie.

39:41.419 --> 39:43.220
Yeah, I guess it was.

39:43.254 --> 39:45.255
And I shouldn't
have talked to her at all.

39:45.289 --> 39:47.157
I should have told you
when I heard from her

39:47.191 --> 39:49.192
and when I called her
back to talk to her.

39:49.227 --> 39:51.294
I'm sorry. I apologize.

39:53.464 --> 39:57.234
And hello, you've lied to me
before and I still trust you.

39:57.268 --> 39:59.269
That was different.
How was it different?

40:00.404 --> 40:02.339
I don't know.
Let me tell you.

40:03.307 --> 40:05.375
Because it was different.

40:05.409 --> 40:10.146
Again, no one has ever
trusted me, other than you,

40:10.181 --> 40:12.382
so when I got busted,
I felt humiliated,

40:12.416 --> 40:16.286
and I hated myself for letting
you down and I felt unworthy,

40:16.320 --> 40:18.321
and I just
couldn't say that.

40:19.390 --> 40:21.224
It was easier to be angry.

40:22.360 --> 40:25.262
I'm very comfortable angry
and being the victim.

40:25.296 --> 40:27.330
It's a lifelong process
to change that.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.268
Again, I'm sorry.

40:39.243 --> 40:40.277
I'm sorry, too.

40:42.213 --> 40:44.414
And thank you for telling
me that, for apologizing.

40:47.184 --> 40:51.388
Can we please, please go back
to the apartment now? Please?

40:55.092 --> 40:57.093
Ethan.
Just wanted to thank me.

40:57.128 --> 40:58.261
Ethan again?

41:01.399 --> 41:03.233
Oh, my God.

41:03.267 --> 41:05.368
Wait, is this the photo that
he got in trouble with?

41:05.403 --> 41:09.306
No, it's Adrian showing me where
she's going to get a tattoo.

41:09.340 --> 41:13.143
Okay, sooner or later, we've got to
get a sense of humor about Adrian.

41:13.177 --> 41:17.080
What's funny about her constantly,
relentlessly, trying to break us up?

41:17.114 --> 41:19.316
You left out nakedly.

41:19.350 --> 41:21.351
She's crazy,
you know that?

41:21.385 --> 41:23.420
I know that.
And I'm all done with crazy.

41:25.423 --> 41:28.325
You know
I can be crazy too,

41:28.359 --> 41:30.260
if that's what you want,

41:30.294 --> 41:31.361
if that's what you like.

41:32.396 --> 41:33.363
I can.

41:34.365 --> 41:36.232
If you're no
done with crazy,

41:36.267 --> 41:39.269
let me be crazy for you,
don't go to Adrian.

41:39.303 --> 41:42.172
Uh, you? Crazy?

41:42.206 --> 41:45.141
Oh, yeah.
I can be plenty crazy.

41:47.211 --> 41:51.181
In fact, why don't we, the two
of us, go get tattoos right now?

41:51.215 --> 41:53.083
Of what?

41:53.117 --> 41:54.184
Wedding bands.

41:54.218 --> 41:57.187
We're probably never
going to have real ones

41:57.221 --> 42:00.256
so let's go get fake ones
tattooed, that'll show Adrian.

42:00.291 --> 42:04.060
You need a little more
practice at being crazy.

42:04.095 --> 42:06.129
Maybe we'll start
with something else.

42:06.163 --> 42:07.297
I can be crazy.

42:08.399 --> 42:10.100
Let's go.

42:10.125 --> 42:14.125
