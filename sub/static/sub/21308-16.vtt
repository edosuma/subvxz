Okay, you need
to hold still.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.830
One more second.
It needs to be perfect.

00:50.830 --> 00:53.710
Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm!

00:54.830 --> 00:56.920
How do I look?

00:56.920 --> 00:58.710
Super pretty!

00:58.710 --> 01:00.920
Oh, no.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.250
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

01:03.250 --> 01:07.830
No, I know I look amazing,
it's just...

01:07.830 --> 01:09.670
I can't go back
to St. Olga's like this!

01:09.670 --> 01:10.960
I gotta come clean!

01:10.960 --> 01:12.210
Uh-uh!

01:12.210 --> 01:14.330
If you tell those girls
that you have been lying

01:14.330 --> 01:17.330
about being a princess,
they will destroy you.

01:17.330 --> 01:20.120
I still can't believe they want
to give me an honorary degree.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.000
Ugh. I know I inspired
a generation and all,

01:23.000 --> 01:24.750
but I can't keep lying!

01:24.750 --> 01:26.580
Whatever.
It's your funeral.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Hey, goat, just because
you're invisible

01:30.000 --> 01:31.620
doesn't mean
I can't hurt you!

01:31.620 --> 01:34.580
Oh, we're here. Mm.

01:34.580 --> 01:36.330
Come on, ladies.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.420
You're having
a princess problem.

01:43.420 --> 01:46.420
Yeah, I'm having
a princess problem.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.880
Okay, stand up straight.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.670
Arms forward!

01:50.670 --> 01:51.790
And exhale!

01:51.790 --> 01:53.040
Exhale!

01:53.040 --> 01:58.540
Oh! Well, you've
obviously done this before.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.040
Okay. I can't do this.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.670
Princess Turdina,
where you going?

02:06.670 --> 02:09.000
-Ahh!
-Sign my poster!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.290
-Sign my cat!

02:10.290 --> 02:12.000
Sign my face!

02:12.000 --> 02:14.580
Okay, people,
don't crowd her!

02:14.580 --> 02:17.670
Princess Turdina!
It is truly an honor.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.790
Oh, please,
you don't have to--

02:19.790 --> 02:23.040
We can't wait
to show you what we've
done with this place.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
Whoa!

02:24.040 --> 02:27.710
Welcome to Utopia!

02:32.620 --> 02:34.500
Where am I?

02:34.500 --> 02:37.580
Oh, it's so beautiful!

02:37.580 --> 02:40.710
Wow, this is, uh...

02:40.710 --> 02:42.580
really something.

02:42.580 --> 02:46.040
Oh, we got rid of all those
oppressive classes about manners

02:46.040 --> 02:49.000
and "please" and "thank you"
and all that other trash.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.080
We have our own
curriculum now!

02:51.080 --> 02:54.000
Brunch and... party.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.620
When do you sleep?

02:55.620 --> 02:58.250
Oh-ho-ho,
don't worry about it!

02:58.250 --> 03:01.210
You know, sometimes structure
isn't a bad thing!

03:01.210 --> 03:03.960
-I just think
that rules have a place...

03:03.960 --> 03:06.380
Yeah, but you told us
to never conform!

03:06.380 --> 03:08.580
If you weren't being honest
about who you are,

03:08.580 --> 03:11.460
then this whole school
would be built on a lie!

03:11.460 --> 03:16.250
Oh, what I meant to say
was rules have a place...

03:16.250 --> 03:19.080
in the garbage! Hah-hah!

03:19.080 --> 03:22.540
Oh, hah-hah!
Oh, oh, good one.

03:22.540 --> 03:24.920
That was...
Oh, you had me.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.710
Here's some princesses hard
at work on their brunch final.

03:27.710 --> 03:31.080
We don't believe in grades,
no, we don't, just pancakes.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.670
I love learning!

03:34.670 --> 03:38.250
These are
the whispering gardens,
our designated gossip area,

03:38.250 --> 03:41.920
because a princess's voice
shall not be silenced!

03:41.920 --> 03:47.080
Oh, my gosh,
did you hear that Beatrice
and Alfred broke up again?

03:47.080 --> 03:49.960
Oh, no way!

03:49.960 --> 03:51.750
And this is where
we have our party class

03:51.750 --> 03:54.330
to celebrate our freedom
from the reign of Miss Heinous!

03:54.330 --> 03:57.540
I see what you're seeing.
It's cooler at night.

03:57.540 --> 04:02.170
This is the hallway
of Turdina!

04:02.170 --> 04:03.540
Whoa.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.830
This is the very first
Turdina poster we hung up.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.170
All of your T-shirts
and all of your dolls

04:10.170 --> 04:13.170
and a lock of your hair
and a poster of your movie!

04:13.170 --> 04:15.330
Oh, I gotta get
a DVD of that!

04:15.330 --> 04:17.000
This is too much!

04:17.000 --> 04:20.290
Are you kidding?
We owe this whole school to you.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.750
You showed us
that all princesses

04:22.750 --> 04:24.710
don't have to fit
into the same mold.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.380
Pfft. No, I didn't.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.620
And we're gonna show you
our appreciation

04:30.620 --> 04:34.540
by throwing you
the biggest party
this school's ever seen!

04:34.540 --> 04:36.380
A party

04:36.380 --> 04:39.170
Uh, Marco, isn't there something
you wanted to tell these girls?

04:39.170 --> 04:41.540
Oh! Yeah, um...

04:41.540 --> 04:44.830
It's not criminal
to be an individual!

04:44.830 --> 04:47.120
-She said our catchphrase!
-Yay!

04:47.120 --> 04:49.790
Aw, you are way
much more fun as Turdina!

04:49.790 --> 04:51.080
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

04:51.080 --> 04:53.170
It's here!
It's here!

04:53.170 --> 04:54.120
What's here?

04:54.120 --> 04:56.000
Check it out!
Isn't it amazing?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.580
Whoa.

04:57.580 --> 05:01.120
In honor of the one princess
who changed our lives,

05:01.120 --> 05:03.880
we dedicate this to you!

05:03.880 --> 05:05.880
I'm so beautiful.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.880
I hope you do like it,
Princess Turdina!

05:07.880 --> 05:11.080
It took all year to save up
enough to get it made!

05:11.080 --> 05:14.420
We cleaned toilets
on weekends for extra cash.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.460
But it was worth it
because you showed us

05:16.460 --> 05:18.080
that there's another way
to live.

05:19.830 --> 05:21.250
Hey, hey, it's time

05:21.250 --> 05:23.460
for a group selfie
in front of the statue.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.000
Oh, okay, sure.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.880
Camera phone! Mm!

05:27.880 --> 05:30.000
Are you...
enjoying this?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.620
Hey, this is the first time
he's ever been popular!

05:32.620 --> 05:34.250
Don't ruin it for him.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.000
Well, he should tell the truth
like a decent human being.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.250
Hey, Turdina, can I talk
to you for a sec?

05:39.250 --> 05:41.080
Sure. Uh, bye, ladies!

05:41.080 --> 05:44.080
Marco, I think you're running
out of time to tell the truth.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.250
Don't even listen
to her, Turdina!

05:46.250 --> 05:48.040
These princesses
worship you!

05:48.040 --> 05:51.210
Yeah, but they worship
someone who doesn't exist.

05:51.210 --> 05:54.380
Marco is the most organized,
rule-abiding person I know.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.460
Think of the party!

05:56.460 --> 05:58.580
Yeah, they spent all that money
for the statue.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.250
I can't crush
their spirits!

06:00.250 --> 06:02.880
I'm just worried
you might be letting

06:02.880 --> 06:05.250
this attention
get to your head!

06:05.250 --> 06:07.170
What? That's not it!

06:07.170 --> 06:09.080
This is for them,
not for me!

06:09.080 --> 06:11.120
Princess Turdina,
come on!

06:11.120 --> 06:13.080
It's time
for your ceremony!

06:13.080 --> 06:14.460
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

06:14.460 --> 06:16.500
but I'm going
with Pony's advice.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.670
Whoo! Good choice.

06:22.170 --> 06:24.000
Oppression!

06:24.000 --> 06:26.580
Eternal darkness!

06:26.580 --> 06:28.120
Suddenly light!

06:28.120 --> 06:29.330
Freedom!

06:29.330 --> 06:30.460
Turdina!

06:33.460 --> 06:34.960
Thank you,
Princess Gwendolyn,

06:34.960 --> 06:37.170
for that beautiful
interpretive dance.

06:37.170 --> 06:40.170
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for,

06:40.170 --> 06:45.460
the woman herself,
Princess Marco Turdina!

06:49.920 --> 06:54.210
I present you this honorary
St. Olga's degree.

06:54.210 --> 06:55.330
Wow!

06:55.330 --> 06:58.290
Turdina!

07:00.290 --> 07:02.120
Dearest princesses,

07:02.120 --> 07:05.420
congratulations
on this wonderful school.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.330
I know you see me
as an idol,

07:07.330 --> 07:10.920
but today
you're my idols!

07:10.920 --> 07:13.710
You embody everything
that Princess Turdina...

07:13.710 --> 07:16.790
uh, um, that I stand for--

07:16.790 --> 07:19.420
not letting anyone force you
to be something you're not,

07:19.420 --> 07:21.790
living by your true colors,

07:21.790 --> 07:24.620
loving who you are!

07:24.620 --> 07:27.290
I'm proud to have inspired
you to be brave,

07:27.290 --> 07:28.960
even when it's scary.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.620
And when being true
to yourself

07:30.620 --> 07:34.170
might mean disappointing
thousands of people.

07:34.170 --> 07:35.250
Um...

07:38.170 --> 07:39.540
That's--

07:39.540 --> 07:41.380
that's why I have
to tell you the truth.

07:41.380 --> 07:44.210
I, Princess Marco Turdina,

07:44.210 --> 07:46.830
-am a boy!

07:50.170 --> 07:51.170
Oh, no.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.170
[all gasping,
screaming]

07:58.170 --> 07:59.290
Ooh!

07:59.290 --> 08:01.210
It's Miss Heinous!

08:01.210 --> 08:03.210
Princess Turdina
is a fraud,

08:03.210 --> 08:05.620
and I have
the evidence to prove it.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.960
-It's a tape...

08:07.960 --> 08:11.830
That's right,
I watched your video
and saw your dark secret!

08:11.830 --> 08:14.000
Oh, that phony confession I did?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.040
Go ahead, show 'em!
It's not real.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.250
Oh, no, it's not...

08:18.250 --> 08:23.120
but this is. Uh!

08:27.670 --> 08:30.710
Turdina isn't a princess!
She's a boy!

08:31.830 --> 08:33.290
How'd you know
about Rodrigo?

08:33.290 --> 08:35.290
Whatever! That doesn't
prove anything!

08:35.290 --> 08:37.250
Princesses
can be hairy!

08:37.250 --> 08:39.580
Yeah! We believe
in you, Turdina!

08:39.580 --> 08:41.080
No.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.250
I lied to you.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.790
I am a boy.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.580
Ooh!

08:49.580 --> 08:52.250
Oop! I mean, ugh!

08:52.250 --> 08:54.710
This, princesses,
is why you need me

08:54.710 --> 08:56.290
running St. Olga's.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.580
Look where all
this freedom got you--

08:58.580 --> 09:00.420
living in filth

09:00.420 --> 09:02.460
and championing a "hero"

09:02.460 --> 09:04.460
who's been lying
to you all along!

09:04.460 --> 09:08.670
Henceforth, you must reinstate
me as your schoolmaster!

09:08.670 --> 09:10.460
You need me...

09:10.460 --> 09:13.460
and I need you.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.000
Wait, what did she just say?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.670
Wait, no, why does it matter
if he's a boy?

09:17.670 --> 09:19.540
Nothing he said
was wrong!

09:19.540 --> 09:23.120
Yeah! He can think
for himself and so can we!

09:23.120 --> 09:25.460
He can be a princess
if he wants to!

09:25.460 --> 09:27.460
Turdina's a state of mind!

09:28.460 --> 09:30.460
Silence! Silence!

09:31.880 --> 09:35.330
Oh, I just got her
right in the face!

09:35.330 --> 09:38.330
Come on, girls!

09:38.330 --> 09:41.540
-Yeah!
-Free will!

09:41.540 --> 09:43.290
No! No!

09:44.500 --> 09:45.670
Spare me.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.540
Get in the car!

09:48.960 --> 09:51.540
Turdina lives!

10:00.460 --> 10:02.500
Well, looks like Turdina's
gone for good.

10:02.500 --> 10:06.500
Yeah, because you
took her away from us,
you selfish monster!

10:06.500 --> 10:09.380
You look like you can breathe
a lot easier now.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.290
Mostly 'cause I'm
out of that dress!

10:11.290 --> 10:13.380
That corset
was killin' me!

10:13.380 --> 10:16.880
Could we get a selfie
with Marco Turdina,
Boy Princess?

10:16.880 --> 10:17.920
Sure.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.170
Camera phone!

10:20.170 --> 10:23.830
Oh, Smoochie's gonna be
so jealous of this one!

10:23.830 --> 10:26.250
Where is Smoochie,
anyways?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.960
♪♪

10:38.120 --> 10:41.330
Ah! Oh, yeah,
that's good!

10:41.330 --> 10:43.960
Gemini, we gotta get
more of this stuff.

10:43.960 --> 10:48.750
Oh, yes, but I'm afraid this one
is out of juice, milady.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.500
Camera phone...

10:50.500 --> 10:53.210
I know that,
you fool!

10:53.210 --> 10:55.000
I'm not talking about her!

10:55.000 --> 10:58.750
Well, I'm happy to share
some of mine with you.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.460
No! I want
the good stuff.

11:01.460 --> 11:05.460
I'm coming for you,
Princess Marco Turdina!

11:05.460 --> 11:08.540
I don't mean
to interrupt, milady,

11:08.540 --> 11:11.250
but we say this
all the time.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.420
"I'm coming for you..."

11:13.420 --> 11:16.960
Maybe we should
just stay in tonight

11:16.960 --> 11:21.120
and you can have
a little Gemini fuel.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.920
No. Nobody asked you.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.330
Go get the car!

11:24.330 --> 11:27.120
Uh, of course, milady.
