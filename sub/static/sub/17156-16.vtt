I understand now!

20:32.606 --> 20:34.657
It all makes
perfect sense!

20:34.659 --> 20:36.242
Huh?

20:39.130 --> 20:41.630
I know why
the map called you here.

20:41.632 --> 20:42.998
You do?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.801
If Twilight had used her magic
to fix the park,

20:45.803 --> 20:47.953
it wouldn't have fixed
the real problem,

20:47.955 --> 20:49.972
which is
that these Manehattan ponies

20:49.974 --> 20:53.008
didn't think they had time to do
something for their community!

20:53.010 --> 20:54.343
But by building that stage

20:54.345 --> 20:56.178
and making sure
the play went on,

20:56.180 --> 20:58.964
you showed them that just
by doing something small,

20:58.966 --> 21:01.517
you can make
a big difference!

21:01.519 --> 21:02.968
Well, I'll be.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.570
It means you have more
in common

21:04.572 --> 21:06.655
with the Manehattan ponies
than you thought!

But all the same,

21:09.160 --> 21:11.861
I'd sure like to head back
to Ponyville on the next train.

21:11.863 --> 21:13.946
I want to check in
with Apple Bloom and find out

21:13.948 --> 21:15.698
how the Sisterhooves Social
turned out.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.833
Oh, absolutely, my dear.

21:17.835 --> 21:21.320
Just as soon as I stop that pony
in the shop over there

21:21.322 --> 21:23.589
from purchasing
that dreadfully hideous scarf!

21:23.591 --> 21:24.790
Stop!

You're making
a terrible mistake!
