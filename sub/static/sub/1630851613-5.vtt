You're Pauline, right?

00:25.226 --> 00:26.205
You want someone investigated.

- What, you expecting an
old guy with a raincoat?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.299
No, this shit's just here
so my mum doesn't wonder

00:33.379 --> 00:34.598

girlfriend called Bonzo?

00:53.684 --> 00:55.682

I'm telling you, I need some
serious dirt on this woman.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.370
- Listen, fam, first thing
you learn in this game

01:11.470 --> 01:13.168
is everyone's got nasty
shit in their closet.

01:13.268 --> 01:14.807

Of course I'm upset.

You know, devastated,

02:07.106 --> 02:08.085

I'm gonna go to Japan,
you're gonna work with Kat

02:17.018 --> 02:20.116
and to be honest, I'm
really excited for us.

02:20.216 --> 02:22.794
- That is good, because I'm
really excited for us, too.

02:22.894 --> 02:25.472
- Well, then, I'm excited
that both of us are excited.

02:25.572 --> 02:27.570

- Yeah!

you were saying

02:30.608 --> 02:33.146
about Kat's evil plan
to steal me away.

02:33.246 --> 02:34.864
- Come on, you know, we
were trapped in a coffin.

02:34.964 --> 02:36.463
I didn't know what I was saying.

02:36.563 --> 02:39.381
Kat is great and obviously,
there were difficulties

02:39.481 --> 02:41.020
at the beginning,
I'm not gonna lie,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.538
but you don't get to be
best friends immediately.

02:43.638 --> 02:45.976
You like her, and I'm sure
I'm gonna like her too.

02:46.076 --> 02:48.074
- Yeah.

02:48.474 --> 02:51.412
I think you need to get to
know Kat a little bit better.

02:51.512 --> 02:53.010

02:53.110 --> 02:57.607

09:00.064 --> 09:01.882
Is it weird sex stuff?

09:01.982 --> 09:02.841
Money laundering or-
- Listen.

09:02.941 --> 09:04.880
I've never had this before.

09:04.980 --> 09:06.439
- You're ruining our last job.

09:06.539 --> 09:07.518
(gunshot blasts)

09:07.618 --> 09:08.597
- What was that?
- It's nothing.

09:08.697 --> 09:09.956
It's weird sex stuff, isn't it?

09:10.056 --> 09:11.675
Please tell me it's
weird sex stuff.

09:11.775 --> 09:13.433
- There's nothing.

09:13.533 --> 09:14.992
- What do you mean, nothing?

09:15.092 --> 09:16.271
- I mean, she's literally
got nothing on her.

09:16.371 --> 09:17.950
She's whiter than
mountain biking, bruv.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.868
This Kat lady doesn't have a
parking ticket to her name.

09:19.968 --> 09:21.787
- Yeah, you need to
keep digging, okay?

09:21.887 --> 09:23.425
- I've looked at
everything, trust me.

09:23.525 --> 09:25.144
There's a handful of not so
very profitable companies

09:25.244 --> 09:26.463
alongside the
self-help business,

09:26.563 --> 09:28.861
but nothing that's
even close to dirt.

09:28.961 --> 09:30.180
I'll send you through
my file in a bit,

09:30.280 --> 09:31.619
but I doubt there's
anything you can use.

09:31.719 --> 09:33.338
I'm sorry, yeah?

09:33.438 --> 09:34.377
Oi!

09:34.477 --> 09:36.475
Do not make me bar you, bro.

(gunshots blasting)

09:41.791 --> 09:44.469
(dramatic music)

09:53.302 --> 09:54.521
- Where's the other Muppet?

09:54.621 --> 09:55.800
(Fran clears throat)

09:55.900 --> 09:57.159
- Hello, Siobhan.

09:57.259 --> 10:00.516
(dramatic music)

10:00.616 --> 10:02.715
- This is it? I
can't believe it.

10:02.815 --> 10:04.473
It's our final hit.

10:04.573 --> 10:05.712
- Guess so.

10:05.812 --> 10:08.710
(Siobhan whimpers)

10:08.810 --> 10:09.909
This isn't right,
Jamie, I'm sorry.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.907
I've not been honest with you.

10:12.007 --> 10:14.825
I feel shit about
all this, I do.

10:14.925 --> 10:17.863
I feel angry and I feel jealous.

10:17.963 --> 10:20.401
I have these crazy thoughts
in my head about Kat,

10:22.239 --> 10:23.458
and I think it's just
been easier for me

10:23.558 --> 10:25.137
to blame somebody else
than accept the fact

10:25.237 --> 10:27.775
that you and I doing
everything together

10:27.875 --> 10:29.874
all the time just had
to come to an end.

10:31.033 --> 10:32.851
- I'm so glad you
said something, mate.

10:32.951 --> 10:34.730
To be honest, I've
been kind of bummed out

10:34.830 --> 10:36.828
you seemed so fine with it.

10:38.067 --> 10:40.765
I've been putting on a
bit of a show today, too.

10:40.865 --> 10:42.723
I'm gagging it.

10:42.823 --> 10:45.281
What am I gonna do without
you to fall back on?

10:45.381 --> 10:48.139
What if I'm really,
really bad at the new job?

10:49.418 --> 10:50.677
Maybe I should
just come to Japan.

10:50.777 --> 10:52.875
- No, because you're
gonna smash it.

10:52.975 --> 10:54.974
I know you are, I know it.

10:55.294 --> 10:57.192
Kat is so lucky to have you.

10:57.292 --> 11:00.989
Plus you need a break from
boring old Professor Snape here.

11:01.089 --> 11:02.348
- Hang on.

11:02.448 --> 11:03.667
Was he the beardy guy
that kept inviting kids

11:03.767 --> 11:05.306
back to his cottage?

11:05.406 --> 11:07.744
- No, mate, that's Hagrid,
and he's more of a handyman

11:07.844 --> 11:10.342
than a professor, but
it doesn't matter.

11:10.442 --> 11:11.941
Let it go.

11:12.041 --> 11:13.899
- It really says a lot
that after all this time,

11:13.999 --> 11:16.037
we can still be so
honest with each other.

11:18.795 --> 11:23.592
(heartfelt orchestral music)
("At Last")

11:24.911 --> 11:27.728
- Come on, you. Let's
go to Kat's party.

11:27.828 --> 11:28.608
- Soft launch.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.786
- Don't say soft launch.

11:32.305 --> 11:33.644
God, I completely forgot.

11:33.744 --> 11:34.883
(gunshot blasts)
(wound squelches)

11:34.983 --> 11:36.401
Well remembered.

11:36.501 --> 11:38.720

- I know, right?

12:06.518 --> 12:09.456
There are rooms in here
even I haven't been in.

12:09.556 --> 12:10.974
(door clicking)

12:11.074 --> 12:12.733
I haven't even given
hedge maze a try yet.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.092
- Hedge maze?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.370
Who does she think
she is, Anne Boleyn?

12:16.470 --> 12:19.408
- Who'd have thought my
flat being demolished

12:19.508 --> 12:22.246
would turn out to
be kinda great?

12:22.346 --> 12:24.524
Must be all the positive karma
I'm putting out in the world.

12:24.624 --> 12:25.763
- Hi, guys.

12:25.863 --> 12:26.842
Hello.

12:26.942 --> 12:29.080
Thank you for coming.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.759
Aw.

12:30.859 --> 12:34.836
Jamie, you look amazing.

12:34.936 --> 12:35.955
- Yay!

12:36.055 --> 12:37.394
Sorry we're late.

12:37.494 --> 12:39.432
The job took a bit
longer than expected.

12:39.532 --> 12:41.311
- Yeah, well, last day
you're working together,

12:41.411 --> 12:43.669
lots of emotions, I imagine.

12:43.769 --> 12:45.308
Fran, Japan?

12:45.408 --> 12:47.406
I think they'll really
get you over there.

12:49.005 --> 12:50.204
Jamie, there's some people
I'd like you to meet.

12:50.284 --> 12:51.743
Fran, there's a free bar.

12:51.843 --> 12:53.541
So feel free to get stuck in.

12:53.641 --> 12:55.340
No spirits, I'm
afraid, but I'm sure

12:55.440 --> 12:57.678
they could dig something out
if you're really desperate.

13:02.434 --> 13:04.433
- There's no seafood
in this, is there?

13:05.392 --> 13:06.731
- No.

13:06.831 --> 13:08.829
- Hmm.

13:11.827 --> 13:14.505
(group laughing)

13:22.059 --> 13:23.158
- So how do you know Kat?

13:23.258 --> 13:24.557
You work in publishing or?

13:24.657 --> 13:26.116
- Oh, no.

13:26.216 --> 13:27.475
But it's an interesting story.

13:27.575 --> 13:28.794
We were at school together-

13:28.894 --> 13:30.892
- Sorry, I've seen
someone I know.

13:34.409 --> 13:36.787
(man spitting)

13:36.887 --> 13:41.644
- The waitress said there wasn't
any seafood in it. (vomits)

13:42.763 --> 13:45.341
(light music)

13:45.441 --> 13:49.598
(people chattering
in the distance)

13:55.593 --> 13:58.491
(gentle music)

13:58.591 --> 14:00.589
- Oh, please.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.545
(muffled jazzy music)

14:24.250 --> 14:27.228
(pages rustling)

14:27.328 --> 14:28.427
- [Jamie] What you
doing hiding in here?

14:28.527 --> 14:30.146
- Bloody hell,
Jamie, you scared me.

14:30.246 --> 14:32.104
- Come on, I'll introduce
you to Kat's friends.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.143
- Oh, no, I'm fine, honestly.

14:34.243 --> 14:36.421
I'm old enough to have met
everybody I need to in my life.

14:36.521 --> 14:38.180
- You'll love them,
I promise you.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.218
- Ah, that's what you said
about Magic Mike Live,

14:40.318 --> 14:41.857
and then I ended up
with some guy's balls

14:41.957 --> 14:43.535
on my shoulder for
an hour and a half.

14:43.635 --> 14:46.073
(light music)

14:51.989 --> 14:54.027
- Ah, Jamie, there you are.

14:55.106 --> 14:57.105
- Hi.

14:58.344 --> 15:01.082
- Sorry, everyone, this is Fran,

15:01.182 --> 15:03.580
Jamie's colleague,
former colleague.

15:10.255 --> 15:11.154
I'm wanted.

15:11.254 --> 15:13.252
Jamie, come with me.

15:18.408 --> 15:20.566
- Whoo, gosh, it is so hot.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.782
(glass clinking)

15:25.882 --> 15:28.740
- Ladies and gents, two words.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.898
Kat Gaitskill.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.177
Come inside, everybody.

15:33.277 --> 15:34.895
(heels clacking)

15:34.995 --> 15:36.994
- Yeah, yeah, bye.

15:38.592 --> 15:40.591
I've got two words.

15:41.950 --> 15:43.688
- Wow.

15:43.788 --> 15:45.287
Wow.

15:45.387 --> 15:47.965
Thank you, thank you
so much for coming

15:48.065 --> 15:52.481
to the soft launch of my
new book, "I Am in Control."

15:52.581 --> 15:55.799
(crowd claps)

15:55.899 --> 15:57.877
Thank you, thank you.

15:57.977 --> 16:00.915
I don't suppose the turnout
has anything whatsoever

16:01.015 --> 16:02.833
to do with the
free food. (laughs)

16:02.933 --> 16:05.451
(crowd laughs)

16:06.850 --> 16:11.067
No, but seriously, my
success means nothing

16:11.167 --> 16:13.345
without the people I love.

16:13.445 --> 16:14.984
- [Crowd] Aww.

16:15.084 --> 16:19.480
- And I feel so lucky for my
success and for my talent,

16:21.039 --> 16:24.257
for my lovely home,
sure, but most of all,

16:24.357 --> 16:28.254
I feel lucky because the
universe has finally blessed me

16:28.354 --> 16:30.472
with the only thing
that really matters,

16:31.791 --> 16:34.828
a friendship that I
know will last forever.

16:36.267 --> 16:41.064
My roomie, my confidant,
my new colleague, Jamie.

16:42.303 --> 16:43.801
Come on, come up here, Jamie.

16:43.901 --> 16:44.761
(crowd claps)
(phone beeping)

16:44.861 --> 16:45.580
Come up here, come on, Jamie.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.439
Come on.

16:47.539 --> 16:48.917
Don't be shy.

16:49.017 --> 16:50.516
Jamie, everyone.

16:50.616 --> 16:51.595
Okay.

16:51.695 --> 16:54.933
So, no, not up, just there.

16:56.691 --> 16:57.431
(water trickling)

16:57.531 --> 16:58.750
- No fucking way.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.308
- So I would like
to propose a toast.

17:01.408 --> 17:02.827
- Ooh, um, sorry, excuse me.

17:02.927 --> 17:04.185
Oop, sorry.

17:04.285 --> 17:06.304
I'd like to propose a
little toast myself,

17:06.404 --> 17:08.142
if that's okay, Kat.

17:08.242 --> 17:09.941
Hmm?

17:10.041 --> 17:11.620
- Yeah, sure.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.417
- I think we all know that
Kat is being rather modest.

17:14.517 --> 17:17.735
Luck has absolutely nothing
to do with her success.

17:17.835 --> 17:20.253
No, everything she's
achieved she's done

17:20.353 --> 17:23.151
through a mixture of
hard work and dedication,

17:24.550 --> 17:26.568
and careful planning.

17:26.668 --> 17:27.567
- Here, here.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.666
- Thank you, you're very kind.

17:30.745 --> 17:31.964
- The same, of course, true

17:32.064 --> 17:34.722
for Kat's friendship
with Jamie, right?

17:34.822 --> 17:36.001
Was it luck, for example,

17:36.101 --> 17:38.119
that brought Jamie
back into Kat's life?

17:38.219 --> 17:41.916
Or was it the fact that
Kat owns the company

17:42.016 --> 17:44.014
that bulldozed Jamie's flat?

17:48.291 --> 17:50.070
I was expecting a bit of a
gasp or something there, guys,

17:50.170 --> 17:51.828
if I'm honest.

17:51.928 --> 17:53.147
- Fran, what are
you talking about?

17:53.247 --> 17:54.826
- It's true.

17:54.926 --> 17:56.585
Kat own the company that
made you homeless, Jamie.

17:56.685 --> 17:58.143
Bit of a coincidence, yeah?

17:58.243 --> 17:59.902
It all adds up.
Just think about it.

18:00.002 --> 18:01.501
You know, she gets
you out of your gaffe,

18:01.601 --> 18:03.539
she invites you into
her swanky new mansion

18:03.639 --> 18:05.338
so you can buddy up
to you, and hey, oh,

18:05.438 --> 18:08.375
I'm out in the cold like
a hooling great bellend.

18:08.475 --> 18:09.694
- How do you know all this?

18:09.794 --> 18:11.493
- Because I hired a
private investigator.

18:11.593 --> 18:14.211
(crowd gasps)
- What? That gets a gasp?

18:14.311 --> 18:15.050
Really?

18:15.150 --> 18:16.409
- You did what?

18:16.509 --> 18:18.168
- I was worried
about you, Jamie.

18:18.268 --> 18:20.006
Who knows what
Kat's really up to.

18:20.106 --> 18:21.885
You know, it's like
that German bloke

18:21.985 --> 18:24.283
who befriended that other bloke
and then invited him round

18:24.383 --> 18:25.682
and paid him to
eat his own dick.

18:25.782 --> 18:26.581
That actually
happened, by the way.

18:26.661 --> 18:28.480
You can look that up.

18:28.580 --> 18:29.879
That's not the same
as this, obviously.

18:29.979 --> 18:31.837
That, it's different,
but you get my point,

18:31.937 --> 18:35.035
which is she's been
lying this whole time.

18:35.135 --> 18:36.553
- Jamie, it's true.

18:36.653 --> 18:39.911
A company I own did
acquire your building

18:40.011 --> 18:43.288
and demolish it, but I had
no idea you lived there.

18:44.647 --> 18:46.546
And as soon as I found
out at the reunion,

18:46.646 --> 18:49.223
I did everything I could
to try and make it better.

18:49.323 --> 18:51.861
But I should've been
totally honest with you,

18:51.961 --> 18:55.538
and the fact that I
wasn't, I will regret

18:55.638 --> 18:57.637
until the day I die.

18:58.316 --> 19:00.315
I'm so sorry.

19:01.634 --> 19:03.632
Can you forgive me?

19:06.110 --> 19:08.109
- Come on.

19:08.429 --> 19:10.207
- What?

19:10.307 --> 19:11.486
- [Crowd] Aw.

19:11.586 --> 19:13.125
- Wow.

19:13.225 --> 19:15.483
You think you know everything
about emotional growth,

19:15.583 --> 19:17.841
and then, hmm.

19:17.941 --> 19:19.280
- She admitted it.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.239
Did you hear that?

19:20.339 --> 19:21.079
She admitted everything.

19:21.179 --> 19:22.398
She admitted she lied.

19:22.498 --> 19:23.677
I know she did
some lovely things

19:23.777 --> 19:25.235
to cover it all up
and blah, blah, blah,

19:25.335 --> 19:28.832
but a lie is a lie forever,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:28.932 --> 19:30.931
- I think you should go, Fran.

19:31.690 --> 19:33.689
- Jamie.

19:43.481 --> 19:46.419
(footsteps shuffling)

19:46.519 --> 19:48.517
- You okay?
(cardboard stand banging)

19:51.235 --> 19:54.892
Ooh, I think someone hit the
free bar too hard. (laughs)

19:54.992 --> 19:57.710
(crowd chuckles)

19:58.629 --> 20:01.527
(door banging)

20:01.627 --> 20:04.345
(birds chirping)

20:06.503 --> 20:08.242
- Oh, God, I'm going,
I'm promise, I'm going.

20:08.342 --> 20:12.398
- Fran, I've come out
here to ask you to stay.

20:12.498 --> 20:15.236
This is all just a
silly misunderstanding.

20:15.336 --> 20:17.474
- I accused you of cannibalism.

20:17.574 --> 20:20.192
- Yeah, okay, that
was kinda crazy,

20:20.292 --> 20:21.991
but I totally get it.

20:22.091 --> 20:24.549
You're worried about
Jamie, but honestly,

20:24.649 --> 20:26.108
you've done me a huge favour.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.546
I've been feeling so
guilty about Jamie's flat,

20:28.646 --> 20:33.462
and now I feel like a
huge weight's been lifted.

20:33.562 --> 20:35.580
Come on, Fran, you're
going away tomorrow.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.679
Do you really want to
leave things like this?

20:39.038 --> 20:41.796
(soft rock music)

20:44.993 --> 20:47.511
(door banging)

20:53.506 --> 20:55.005
(crowd chattering)

20:55.105 --> 20:56.644
- I thought the
party was out here.

20:56.744 --> 20:59.202
- Poor thing wanted
to be on her own.

20:59.302 --> 21:01.300
She's downstairs in
my meditation studio.
