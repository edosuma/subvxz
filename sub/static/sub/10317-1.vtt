00:24.941 --> 00:28.277
- How's my mother doing?
- Not so good today.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.802
Why weren't you in here before?

00:53.970 --> 00:56.221
- The doctor said...
- Screw the doctor.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.474
Mom.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.062
- You should save your strength.
- Jack, if I go...

01:03.188 --> 01:05.397
Mom, you're not going to go.

01:05.522 --> 01:08.817
If I go, I want you
to make me a promise.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.324
- Say, "I promise."
- I promise.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.992
That you'll always love me.

01:18.995 --> 01:19.995
Of course, Mom.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.372
And you'll never get married.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.335
Mom, no, no.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.712
I can't promise that.

01:28.838 --> 01:33.217
No girl could love you like I did, Jack.
You'll be unhappy. Don't do it.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.095
Mom, don't say that.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.847
Promise me, Jack. Never.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.517
Mom, that's a huge thing to ask.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.520
Mom... Mom!

01:44.646 --> 01:46.855
Mom! Mom!

01:47.732 --> 01:51.193
Mom, come back!
I promise I won't get married!

04:00.198 --> 04:02.950
That's Mrs. Lupo
with the cable installer.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.745
I'm Jack Singer, and I was hired
by Mrs. Lupo's paranoid husband,

04:06.871 --> 04:09.081
who turned out
not to be so paranoid.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.959
I feel for the guy. I really do.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.294
I feel for all these people,
men and women,

04:14.420 --> 04:17.755
the cheaters and cheated on,
sneaking around hotel lobbies

04:17.882 --> 04:19.841
looking over their shoulders.

04:20.009 --> 04:24.513
I'm sorry, but they only confirm what
my crazy mother said about marriage:

04:24.681 --> 04:27.182
That it's a disaster waiting to happen.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.184
Although my job can get depressing,

04:29.310 --> 04:31.019
at least it's not dangerous,

04:31.145 --> 04:33.355
and I do hear some great stories.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.858
My wife is having an affair
with Mike Tyson.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.613
"Mike Tyson" Mike Tyson?

04:41.739 --> 04:43.699
Yeah.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.036
That's her. That's Millie.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.917
Well, she's a beautiful girl.

04:54.043 --> 04:58.130
- When I think of the two of 'em!
- All right. Calm down. Calm down.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.965
Let's just think this through.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.261
Now, my first question, obviously:

05:04.387 --> 05:06.555
- You've seen them together?
- What?

05:06.723 --> 05:10.100
You've seen them together?
Your wife and Mr. Tyson?

05:11.060 --> 05:13.061
- You don't believe me either!
- Of course I believe you.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.064
- I just need a place to start.
- Everybody thinks I'm nuts!

05:16.232 --> 05:18.400
The guys at the plant. Everybody.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.945
They tell me she's sneaking with
Freddy Ramirez at the Sunrise Motel,

05:22.071 --> 05:24.072
but I know it's the champ.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.615
She wouldn't cheat with a piece of shit

05:25.742 --> 05:28.201
like Freddy Ramirez,
beautiful girl like that.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.414
I'm sure you're right.
Don't get me wrong, OK?

05:32.540 --> 05:35.751
But, hey, for openers, let's say
I follow this Ramirez around...

05:35.918 --> 05:38.086
Make sure it's not him.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.297
- You're all the same.
- Mr. Tomashefsky.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.508
- Nobody believes me.
- Don't just take off.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.472
I'm sure it's hard to talk about,
but I'm a good listener!

05:48.598 --> 05:49.931
Mr. Tomashefsky!

05:50.058 --> 05:53.185
- Leave me alone!
- Hi, Bob.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.897
It's not glamorous work,
that's the bottom line.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.565
So why am I
telling you all of this?

05:59.317 --> 06:01.902
Because I do have
an amazing story to tell

06:02.028 --> 06:04.946
about me and my girlfriend,
Betsy Nolan.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.492
She teaches second grade
at the Skelton School in Manhattan,

06:08.618 --> 06:10.494
and she's the love of my life.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.122
- I just haven't been able to marry her.
- Milton moved out?

06:14.290 --> 06:16.124
Thursday.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.002
I had ordered Chinese,
and he says, "Chinese again?"

06:19.128 --> 06:21.963
Then he comes out
with his suitcase already packed!

06:22.131 --> 06:25.926
I know David's been very quiet.
I thought that something was wrong.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.013
Listen, Judy, if there's
anything that I can do...

06:30.139 --> 06:33.016
Thanks. I thought it was important
that you know.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.351
I'm so sorry.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.188
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.232
- See you tomorrow, OK?
- OK.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.401
- Bye.
- Come on, sweetie.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.113
- I was in the neighborhood.
- What a nice surprise.

06:47.490 --> 06:51.660
Oh. Forgot about that.
Tough day, huh?

06:51.828 --> 06:55.455
It's so awful. And besides David,
they have a two-year old.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.707
- That's my point.
- About what?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.501
People get married, and then they do

06:59.627 --> 07:02.003
the most hideous,
unbelievable things to each other.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.882
Not all people. Come on, Jack.
That's your mother talking.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.304
- I dreamt about her again last night.
- Was she naked again?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.099
Hey, I only had one dream
where she was naked.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.393
- She was vacuuming.
- Still...

07:16.519 --> 07:17.936
It wasn't sexual.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.605
It was about cleanliness.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.983
She's so great.
When I play poker,

07:23.109 --> 07:26.111
she helps with the food,
and she's funny with the guys.

07:26.237 --> 07:31.324
Now, the ones with those pretty crowns,
they're called kings?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.535
Kidding!

07:33.661 --> 07:35.537
- Is she the best?
- She's the best.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.664
Now shut up already. Let's play.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.499
And sometimes,
if she's off from school,

07:39.625 --> 07:41.877
she'll go out with me on a tail job.

07:42.003 --> 07:46.047
OK, Rolexes, 35 dollars.
Downtown, they're 45.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.799
Bada-bing, bada-bang.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.886
- There he is.
- That's him?

07:51.012 --> 07:54.598
That fat pig? And he has four kids?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.058
Just a little louder.
They might not have heard you.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.811
- I'm hungry. How about you?
- Wait a beat.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.939
Now.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.447
This is very hard being inconspicuous.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.743
It's a gift. Your problem is you're much
too beautiful for this kind of work.

08:14.869 --> 08:18.121
Me? I'm everyman.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.581
Here we go.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.751
Oh, God.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.174
Ugh! This is so depressing.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.927
But it doesn't mean that we'd
wind up like this, Jack, it doesn't.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.428
No. It doesn't.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.767
Jack, stop with your mother already.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.894
I try, but I can't.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.688
So why don't you go see a shrink?

08:44.774 --> 08:48.568
It's too much money,
and I prefer to work it out myself.

08:49.695 --> 08:54.115
- As long as you wait for me.
- Of course I'll wait for you.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.370
Sometimes I'm afraid to go to sleep.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.122
Maybe you won't dream about her.

09:02.542 --> 09:07.170
- Maybe I'll just read.
- Come here, you big lug.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.310
A year later,
things with Betsy and me...

09:22.478 --> 09:26.314
Well, they just started
to get very shaky.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.318
I feel as if
I might be coming down with something.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.446
She was finding excuses
not to come over,

09:33.573 --> 09:36.366
and when she did,
things weren't the same.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.119
I'm losing her.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.455
Speaking of losing, you owe me 50
from the Notre Dame game.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.209
- Sally, I love her.
- Love her or not, that's a different...

09:46.335 --> 09:48.420
Sally. Villanova-Georgetown.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.879
You want Georgetown,
you gotta give three.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.508
- Uptown, it's two and a half.
- Cha Cha, do me a favor. Bet uptown.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.635
Jack, if you love her, then marry her.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.180
It's not the end of the world.
The decline, yes, but not the end.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.766
- Thanks very much.
- Ask anybody.

10:01.892 --> 10:06.146
- She's different.
- I repeat... Ask anybody.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.787
- This isn't good, Jack.
- Order something else.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.123
I'm talking about us.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.630
- We're just going through a down phase.
- No, it's bigger than that.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.384
I feel like I'm counting on something
that may never happen.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.888
Jack, we have to go to the next step.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.559
Is this, like, an ultimatum?

10:44.685 --> 10:48.063
No, I'm just telling you
that I won't be a girlfriend forever.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.816
There's too much that I want.
I want kids and a family.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.236
Jack, I've got to know
what the deal is with us.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.032
- I'm in love with you.
- And I'm in love with you.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.285
But I need a commitment.
Life's too short.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.497
I want to be married.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.259
Light's green.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.969
Let's get married tomorrow.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.182
Let's just do it... get on a plane,
go to Vegas and do it.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.142
Now.

11:27.144 --> 11:30.480
- You're serious?
- I must be. My legs are paralyzed.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.524
Oh, sweetie!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.609
The die was cast.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.113
If I had just said "city hall,"
the story would end here,

11:38.280 --> 11:42.033
but I didn't, and Betsy and I
took our fateful trip to Vegas.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.664
The man in the limo
was Tommy Korman, the gambler,

12:29.832 --> 12:32.375
and he was about
to enter my life.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.297
Yep. Home, sweet home.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.302
How you doin'?

12:47.183 --> 12:49.350
I was with two fine-looking
women last night.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.811
One was so fine.
She reminded me of Debra Paget.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.063
She made Debra Paget
look like a boy.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.648
What?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.319
Look at all these Elvises here.
It looks like a friggin' zoo.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.696
- It's a freakin' zoo.
- Mr. Korman!

13:02.740 --> 13:06.868
Mr. Korman, Mr. Sandwich,
Buddy Walker. Welcome to Bally's.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.497
I've replaced Tony Carmelo.
I didn't know if you'd heard.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.833
It escaped my attention.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.627
I wondered if I could
have a word with you.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.504
It's all right.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.881
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah.

13:21.050 --> 13:25.220
- Tommy, we have a small problem.
- Oh, yeah?

13:25.387 --> 13:28.807
Penthouse A is not available, but...

13:28.933 --> 13:30.934
Oh?

13:31.060 --> 13:34.145
Buddy? I would like Penthouse A,

13:34.271 --> 13:37.565
where I've stayed for 15 years,
made up for me now.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.903
The president of Brazil is in there.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.573
I don't care if Ming the Friggin'
Merciless is in there. Get him out.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.741
OK?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.786
- Will do.
- Good.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.666
Now I shake your hand.
That's great, Buddy.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.219
Welcome to McCarran
Field, Las Vegas, Nevada...

14:06.345 --> 14:09.305
the family fun capital of America.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.058
- Good luck.
- We just got here!

14:12.184 --> 14:15.562
Oh, my God!

14:20.693 --> 14:25.280
Oof! This is some heat.
It's got to be 110, easy.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.990
No, but it's dry.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.616
That's what these schmucks say.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.243
- "150, but it's dry."
- Yeah.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.495
So hot you friggin' can't see straight.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.206
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Would you like chaises?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.875
- What?
- Chaises.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.210
- Chaises?
- Yes, sir.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.714
- What's your name?
- Gary, sir.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.217
Well, "Gary sir," do you understand
that there's no more ozone layer left?

14:46.343 --> 14:48.303
That you could get arrested
for friggin' manslaughter,

14:48.429 --> 14:50.597
lettin' people lay out here?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.682
- You find that funny?
- No, sir.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.642
May I have
your attention...

14:54.810 --> 14:56.269
Here. Remember that, all right?

14:57.646 --> 14:59.105
Thank you, sir.

15:01.609 --> 15:05.737
- Remember Donna and her sunbaths?
- Yeah. Who knew back then?

15:06.822 --> 15:08.781
Yeah. Who knew?

15:15.956 --> 15:19.250
Vegas. Miami. Wherever.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.212
She'd lay out there all day
with them Sidney Sheldon books...

15:23.339 --> 15:25.298
and her coconut oil.

15:27.676 --> 15:31.012
Doctor said they never saw skin
like that, like a saddlebag.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.647
- We got a game tonight?
- No. Not yet.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.275
- It's OK.
- Tommy...

15:45.694 --> 15:48.821
- She was a great girl, Donna.
- Yeah.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.032
I should've got her out of the sun.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.703
Twelve bucks!
No air-conditioning either.

15:55.829 --> 15:58.581
- I ain't going to tip him.
- Hound dog can't even speak English.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.544
I gotta get a suit like that.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.968
- That was some fighter.
- Yeah, that was some fighter.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.054
He knocked down Holmes twice.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.848
Twice. Hey, Tommy,
let's go say "hi," no?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.518
- Go ahead.
- Hey, champ, how you doing?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.395
- You look great. How you doing?
- Real good.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.313
What about that Holmes fight
the other day? What happened?

16:22.439 --> 16:24.607
When Holmes went...
What'd he do?

16:24.733 --> 16:26.067
Wham.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.423
What, what, what?

16:49.758 --> 16:51.634
Look over there.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.723
- It's unbelievable.
- Everything.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.101
Her legs. It's Donna.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.106
Look at all those Indian Elvises.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.608
Yeah, they loved
his movie Blue Calcutta.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.193
Come here.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.195
This is unbelievable.

17:12.321 --> 17:13.531
You're unbelievable.

17:13.656 --> 17:16.701
I want to get you in that room,
tear the bedspread off...

17:16.827 --> 17:19.162
Yoo-hoo! Can I get a room?

17:19.288 --> 17:22.373
This is God
giving me a second chance.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.083
There is no doubt about it.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.211
- What if they're married?
- Look at them.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.964
There's no way they're married.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.475
Yikes.

17:42.728 --> 17:46.981
Oh, my God. Jack!

17:47.149 --> 17:49.942
- We can't afford this!
- I got a deal through Sally Molars.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.446
120 bucks a night.
Is this great or what?

18:23.227 --> 18:25.228
What'd you think of that mirror?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.022
I liked it.

18:28.857 --> 18:32.110
I never realized
I had such a beautiful, round behind.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.571
Or was that you?

18:35.697 --> 18:37.365
That might've been me.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.206
It's 2:30 already.

18:49.503 --> 18:53.840
Well, maybe we should get some lunch,
do a little gambling...

18:55.050 --> 18:57.009
...and then get...

18:59.221 --> 19:02.306
I'm very happy.
I want you to know that.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.976
And I love you so, so much.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.562
Oh, I'm glad.

19:17.197 --> 19:20.950
Yeah. Hi. This is Jack Singer
in the Ali Baba Suite.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.412
Yeah, you can take the "Do Not Disturb"
off my phone now. Thanks.

19:43.599 --> 19:47.602
May I have your attention,
please. Bally's is happy to introduce...

19:47.728 --> 19:50.479
There's a poker game
for new guests, 4:00 to 6:00.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.150
That could be fun.
You could get a swim. I play.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.861
- And then we're off.
- Where should we go?

19:56.987 --> 20:00.615
They have all these chapels.
We'll just pick the most outrageous one.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.326
Your hand is wet.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.995
I'm nervous, but I'm OK.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.247
I want to do this.

20:08.373 --> 20:12.126
- Maybe we should go now.
- In this heat? It's 108 degrees.

20:12.294 --> 20:16.464
Come on. No, no, no, we waited
this long, we should do it right.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.008
Wait till the sun sets.
Get dressed up.

20:19.801 --> 20:23.304
- Jack, please.
- It's not just another excuse.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.556
Hey.

20:25.682 --> 20:29.393
- We're here to get married.
- And to be together.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.145
Absolutely.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.814
So why do you have to play poker?

20:33.941 --> 20:36.150
Let's just hang out together.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.653
It'll relax me.
It's a fast game with some yokels.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.696
I'll probably make enough
to pay for the whole trip.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.574
Listen. It's right here,
$1,000 dollars in credits,

20:43.700 --> 20:46.619
so you're, like, covered
if you get murdered on a hand.

20:46.745 --> 20:50.915
This is just a promotional thing,
basically. Relax.

20:52.125 --> 20:56.420
It's two hours.
Then we get married. End of story.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.966
I don't know.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.720
Really glad you could make it...
Jack, right?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.931
Yeah. It's my pleasure.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.849
You know, with all these Elvises...

21:09.017 --> 21:10.268
Excuse me...

21:10.394 --> 21:12.687
Excuse me, Elvises running around, no?

21:12.813 --> 21:15.564
I haven't seen so many sideburns
since West Side Story.

21:18.527 --> 21:23.114
That's very funny. Wait.
That's New York wit. Am I right?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.199
New York wit?

21:26.535 --> 21:31.330
So, Tommy, you organize this
for the hotel? The game?

21:32.207 --> 21:34.834
Right. I'm...

21:34.960 --> 21:37.920
I'm retired from the dress business,
and I basically play for fun.

21:38.046 --> 21:42.383
And the hotel asked me
to help make the guests feel at home.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.344
- So a two-hour card game.
- Nobody gets too badly hurt.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.514
- Sure.
- Come on, come on. Let's play.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.810
The natives are getting restless.
So we'd better get going.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.863
Telephone call
for Betsy Nolan. Betsy Nolan.

22:10.620 --> 22:14.332
Excuse... Jack, would you like me
to turn up the air-conditioning?

22:15.375 --> 22:17.084
- No, thanks.
- Sure?

22:17.210 --> 22:18.502
Yeah. I'm fine.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.757
See the raise.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.176
Bump 20.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.429
Can't catch a break here.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.432
- Get me a sandwich or something.
- Yes, sir.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.311
- I see it.
- Well, boys...

22:35.437 --> 22:37.772
the good Lord was kind enough
to bless me with a full boat.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.774
Fives overjacks.

22:39.900 --> 22:44.195
- Shit.
- Well, the King is out, boys.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.951
I have $20 left.
I probably should go.

22:51.078 --> 22:55.790
Personally, I think you're playing
very well. It's just some bad luck.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.959
You're playing perfect.
Just some bad luck.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.796
Look, guys,
I don't have this kind of money to lose.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.632
What really concerns me here,
Jack, is you're gonna go back

23:04.758 --> 23:07.885
to New York
with a bad feeling about Vegas.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.889
- That concerns me.
- I really won't.

23:12.015 --> 23:14.100
He's scared. That's natural.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.644
Hey, look, it's not a matter
of being scared, OK?

23:18.313 --> 23:20.815
What? It's just money?

23:20.941 --> 23:24.819
- Yeah. It's just money.
- Well.

23:24.986 --> 23:28.406
Tell you what. Here.
You just activated your line of credit.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.742
Here's a thousand.

23:31.868 --> 23:35.538
You lose it, it's on the hotel.
You win it, you pay it back. Fair?

23:35.664 --> 23:38.332
Well, this afternoon
he wanted to play in this poker game...

23:38.458 --> 23:40.668
that they have for new guests.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.504
Mom, I can't hear you.
Oh, thanks.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.842
You know,
it's like an introductory game.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.844
I'll bet 200.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.181
See it.

24:02.149 --> 24:05.151
- See it.
- Well, I'm out.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.990
See the 200 and...
Oh, God...

24:12.909 --> 24:14.493
...raise a hundred.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.538
Too rich for my blood.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.540
See your hundred.

24:25.046 --> 24:28.549
Raise you... a thousand.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.388
This is out of control.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.475
I'm out.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.644
See the thousand.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.901
- We're it, huh?
- Just us chickens.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.114
Both.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.741
Aces over eights.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.369
- Shit!
- Excellent!

24:57.496 --> 24:58.829
This is terrific.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.542
You played that hand like,
"Forget about it," huh?

25:04.252 --> 25:06.253
Thanks. I'm in a regular game
in the city.

25:06.379 --> 25:09.673
Really? You got to tell me that.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.932
I'll call you
right before the ceremony.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.101
Like 10:30 your time.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.811
Of course I'm excited.
What do you think?

25:32.614 --> 25:35.699
♪ Well, bright
light city gonna set my soul

25:35.825 --> 25:38.661
♪ Gonna set my soul on fire

25:38.787 --> 25:41.664
- ♪ I got a whole lot of money...
- Could you shut the fuck up?

25:41.790 --> 25:45.084
Tony, there's absolutely no need
for that type of language here.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.504
All right. Oh...

25:49.839 --> 25:52.424
I raise... 500.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.096
I fold.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.642
Well, baby, the King must fold.

26:04.187 --> 26:06.814
I'll see the 500...

26:07.524 --> 26:08.816
...and I'll raise 2,000.

26:08.942 --> 26:13.904
- You must have tremendous confidence.
- I have tremendous confidence.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.032
Say "good night," Gracie.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.411
A little confidence
ain't going to get it, kid.

26:22.289 --> 26:26.125
I see the 2,500
and raise you three grand.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.836
I think you got nothin'.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.089
That's your constitutional right.

26:32.215 --> 26:35.301
OK. That's the kind of game
we're going to play...

26:37.679 --> 26:39.430
That's five to me...

26:42.934 --> 26:44.685
...and...

26:46.813 --> 26:47.855
I raise you 8,000.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.233
Tommy, I thought
we were playing for fun.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.193
This is fun.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.071
♪ Wise men say

26:56.197 --> 26:58.365
♪ Only fools rush in

26:58.491 --> 27:00.701
Eddie, please.

27:01.745 --> 27:05.039
We may have to institute
a ban on singing here.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.375
I'll see the eight grand.
I'll raise you ten.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.921
Can I borrow 21 grand, please?

27:14.174 --> 27:16.091
Twenty-one grand?

27:18.178 --> 27:21.096
You know you can buy
a friggin' Volvo for 21 grand? Turbo?

27:23.141 --> 27:24.558
I know what I'm doin'.

27:27.562 --> 27:31.774
- You got some guts, kid.
- It's not guts. It's realism.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.914
There's 83 grand in there.

27:51.586 --> 27:52.795
Jackson, what's the word?

27:56.591 --> 27:58.509
I'll see it...

28:00.887 --> 28:02.721
...and I'll raise you ten.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.848
25,000 more, please.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.686
This kid's got some set of balls.
Am I right?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.481
My hat's off to you, kid.

28:12.607 --> 28:15.109
My shirt too, probably,
the way you play.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.077
To you.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.376
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.464
Well, might as well
go down in flames.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.264
What do you got?

28:46.391 --> 28:50.144
Sorry, man.
Straight flush to the jack.

28:55.275 --> 28:58.527
That's... That's one for the books.

29:01.823 --> 29:08.537
To the queen.

29:11.332 --> 29:13.834
That's a tough break.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.755
Would you like a fruit plate?

29:25.263 --> 29:28.182
I'm not assessing any blame here.

29:30.101 --> 29:34.021
But the reality is that you're
in a tremendous amount of trouble.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.232
- If I go to a loan shark...
- Loan shark?

29:37.358 --> 29:39.777
What loan shark's
going to give you 65,000?

29:39.903 --> 29:41.737
If you haven't got it,
there's no way you can pay it back.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.530
If you can, give it to me.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.369
- I can't.
- Nonpayment of debts.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.789
That's extremely serious everywhere.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.875
I mean, among people. Among countries,
governments... They don't give a shit.

29:55.001 --> 29:57.085
Am I right? They stiff everybody.

29:58.463 --> 30:02.257
But...
...individuals...

30:04.260 --> 30:07.721
They are expected to pay debts.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.224
Especially gambling debts.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.770
That's the essence of gambling.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.313
You risk something.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.567
If you put up money
you haven't got and can't get...

30:22.278 --> 30:24.279
That's the lowest.

30:28.409 --> 30:29.910
People...

30:30.036 --> 30:33.330
People can get badly injured.

30:33.456 --> 30:35.582
Jack, I'm talking physically.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.712
Maybe we could work out something
over a period of a couple years.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.633
Hey, what do you think?
You're buying a damn washer and dryer?

30:44.759 --> 30:47.594
You owe Tommy Korman $65,000,
you understand?

30:47.762 --> 30:50.681
Look, I'll rack my brain.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.892
It's all right. I already racked mine.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.895
- Do you have a solution?
- I do.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.863
I want...

31:10.034 --> 31:11.952
...your girlfriend for the weekend.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.540
Betsy?
How do you know Betsy?

31:16.666 --> 31:19.209
I don't... I don't know Betsy.

31:19.335 --> 31:24.006
I don't know her.
I saw her over there in the lobby.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.927
See, my wife Donna...
May she rest in peace...

31:29.053 --> 31:32.180
They look identical.
I mean, they could be twins.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.726
Now, I'm willing
to wipe out the 65 bills...

31:36.853 --> 31:39.438
...if you let me
spend the weekend with her.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.941
We're getting married tonight.

31:43.067 --> 31:47.279
No, no, no, not tonight.
After the weekend.

31:49.490 --> 31:53.076
And, Jack,
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

31:54.203 --> 31:57.539
I just want company.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.002
She won't agree to this.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.713
If she loves you,
she'll agree to this.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.471
May I have
your attention, please.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.597
Hi!

32:13.723 --> 32:16.350
Bally's Casino Resort
is pleased to announce...

32:16.517 --> 32:18.977
another $12,000 winner...

32:19.103 --> 32:24.024
on one of Bally's
hot 97 percent dollar slot machines.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.443
Congratulations to the winner.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.376
What happened?

32:45.254 --> 32:46.713
We, uh...

32:48.549 --> 32:51.259
We have to have a serious talk.

32:54.555 --> 32:57.140
- Are you out of your mind?
- I said you wouldn't do it.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.226
- Is that what you really said?
- Of course. What do you think?

32:59.394 --> 33:03.105
And he actually said, "If she
spends the weekend with me,

33:03.231 --> 33:04.982
you owe me nothing?"

33:05.108 --> 33:07.359
- Yes.
- I am so nauseous.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.236
You don't think
this is totally killing me?

33:09.404 --> 33:12.531
You know, I had this feeling when you
left, then I talked myself out of it.

33:12.657 --> 33:17.077
- Something about this is not right.
- Listen. Just forget I mentioned it.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.287
- There's options.
- Like what?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.623
Neither of us has any money.

33:21.749 --> 33:24.751
God, Jack! What did he say?

33:24.877 --> 33:27.045
He wants me to walk around
in her clothes?

33:28.715 --> 33:32.592
- He wasn't that specific.
- How could you put me in this position?

33:32.719 --> 33:36.763
What do you think? I knew it was coming?
I wanted this to happen?

33:36.889 --> 33:39.683
- I was completely blindsided.
- I still don't understand this.

33:39.809 --> 33:43.437
You went in there with $500.
We had this whole discussion.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.981
I had a straight flush!

33:46.107 --> 33:50.444
Do you know what a straight flush is?
It's, like, unbeatable.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.946
"Like unbeatable" is not "unbeatable."

33:53.072 --> 33:55.115
Hey, I know that now, OK?

33:55.283 --> 33:58.493
Don't yell at me! I hate this place!

33:58.619 --> 34:00.620
I won't sleep with him,
no matter who he is.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.331
Are you crazy? Of course not.
That's not even a consideration.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.541
- No?
- No!

34:04.667 --> 34:05.751
What if he holds a gun to my head?

34:05.877 --> 34:07.794
Betsy, he's a gambler,
he's not a gangster.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.838
He was a garment center guy
originally.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.549
Oh, he was a garment center guy.
Well, that's a relief.

34:12.675 --> 34:17.094
- I'm not saying it's great.
- Look at all these families here.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.514
Happy families.

34:19.639 --> 34:24.186
I'm a whore, Jack.
You've made me into a whore.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.147
Honey, you don't think this is
destroying me? I don't know what to do.

34:27.315 --> 34:31.568
You brought me to Las Vegas,
and you turned me into a whore, Jack!

34:31.694 --> 34:33.695
Shh! Let's just
forget about this, all right?

34:33.821 --> 34:36.114
This is insanity,
and somehow I'll get the money.

34:36.239 --> 34:39.201
From whom?
My parents don't have it.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.496
"One weekend," he said.

34:44.540 --> 34:45.998
Yes.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.879
- I can't.
- And I don't want you to.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.505
This is nuts!

35:02.225 --> 35:04.851
It's eight to five
you're going to need root canal.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.358
Ah.

35:12.443 --> 35:16.696
Dental Health Associates.
Jack, how are ya?

35:16.823 --> 35:19.991
I'm in the midst
of an emotional disaster here.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.578
Sally, don't start. Just listen.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.748
What are my chances
of getting 65 grand by 8:00 Vegas time?

35:26.874 --> 35:30.377
Bad week here, Jack.
I got killed on the Indiana game.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.296
That was a 12-point spread.
Who do you owe?

35:34.674 --> 35:37.217
No shit. Hey, Sid.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.428
Jack Singer owes
Tommy Korman 65 grand.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.266
- He's heard of him.
- Oh, great.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.226
I'd hate to be shacked up
with a small-timer.

35:46.352 --> 35:49.146
You're not "shacked up." Will you stop
making it worse than it is?

35:49.272 --> 35:51.398
I can't make it worse than it is.

35:52.525 --> 35:55.610
Don't screw around with him.
Has he got an alternative?

35:55.736 --> 35:59.322
Good. Then take it.
And don't ask no questions.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.244
Poor bastard.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.261
- I'll be up in the room.
- OK.

36:21.429 --> 36:25.307
Or hanging around the... casino.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.061
Sounds great.

36:30.980 --> 36:34.024
So, I'll see you in, like, what?

36:34.150 --> 36:36.610
Two... two and a half hours?

36:37.278 --> 36:41.823
Hey, tops.
This is a get-acquainted meeting.

36:42.783 --> 36:44.451

37:22.198 --> 37:24.074
With a straight flush?

37:24.200 --> 37:26.576
Yeah. These... These things happen.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.496
Do you know what the odds are? They're,
like, three billion to one against.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.540
- I looked it up.
- You looked it up?

37:33.793 --> 37:37.337
You look... You know what
I used to call Donna? Perry Mason.

37:37.463 --> 37:40.382
- Whatever I said, she had an answer.
- And you resented that.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.510
Oh, no! No, it was like a game.

37:43.636 --> 37:47.514

and she goes, "No, no, no,

37:47.682 --> 37:51.768

say that the repair ratio..."

Yadda, yadda, yadda.
You know, it never ended.

38:03.155 --> 38:07.325
- You read a lot, I bet, huh?
- Yeah. Well, I'm a teacher.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.411
You're a teacher?

38:11.372 --> 38:12.539
I had no idea.

38:13.207 --> 38:15.875
- A teacher.
- Ready?

38:17.003 --> 38:18.586
Absolutely.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.630
Place your bets.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.887
It's extremely important that I win.

38:29.098 --> 38:32.017
- I'll see what I can do for you.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.643

...spread all over the place.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.593
See, that's the thing
about these melanomas.

39:07.887 --> 39:12.390
It's just a... It's just a little piece
of skin. You lift it off like nothing.

39:15.936 --> 39:19.689
The next thing you know,
you're taking CAT scans and...

39:19.815 --> 39:22.817
...it spreads to the lung and the liver.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.779
I'm sorry.

39:26.864 --> 39:30.116
She was pretty young?

39:30.242 --> 39:31.618
Thirty-eight.

39:35.748 --> 39:36.956
What are you gonna do?

39:38.501 --> 39:42.962
- Do you have kids?
- Oh, yeah. Two. Boy and a girl.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.049
Chris and Ally.
They were teenagers then.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.135
Chris, he's married now.

39:50.971 --> 39:53.098
Just out of law school.
He's practicing in Boston.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.768
And... Ally, she's at Bennington.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.187
Fighting off her poetry professor.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.688
She's a knockout.

40:01.982 --> 40:04.567
Chris, you'll meet him this weekend.

40:04.693 --> 40:08.655
- Is he coming here?
- No, he'll join us in Hawaii.

40:17.456 --> 40:20.291
Twenty, twenty, twenty.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.670
No. Twenty doesn't feel good.
Nineteen feels good.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.966
No more bets.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.888
The deal was for the weekend.

40:34.723 --> 40:37.100
Didn't have to be Vegas.
Could be anywhere.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.769
That wasn't my understanding.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.564
I got a place in Kauai.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.275
It's right on the beach.
It'll knock your socks off.

40:46.444 --> 40:50.989
Chris'll be there, his wife, baby.
Be a real family time.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.789
Twenty. Black even.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.712
Place your bets.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.714
Hi, old-timer.
Are you feeling lucky?

41:07.882 --> 41:09.632
Actually, I'm not.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.109
- Betsy!
- Hi.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.445
- So what's the story?
- I have to pack.

41:30.571 --> 41:33.281
We can leave!
What did you work out?

41:34.283 --> 41:36.743
He's taking me to Hawaii.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.412
- It's only for a few days.
- Come on.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.916
You're so, like, blithe about this all
of a sudden, like you don't give a damn!

41:43.042 --> 41:46.961
Of course I give a damn, but this
was not my idea. Poker was not my idea.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.464
Would you please
stop crucifying me with this?

41:49.590 --> 41:50.673
Have you seen my bag?

41:50.799 --> 41:52.509
He's going to jump all over you
the second he gets there.

41:52.635 --> 41:54.260
And I'll let him?
Give me a little credit.

41:54.386 --> 41:56.638
He'll overcome you.
What happens if you start screaming?

41:56.764 --> 41:58.765
It's like a jungle over there!

41:58.891 --> 42:02.769
He probably has servants and bodyguards,
and believe me, they will drug you!

42:02.937 --> 42:06.606
His son is going to be there.
His granddaughter Tiffany will be there.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.275
She knows the kid's name already.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.488
OK.

42:15.115 --> 42:17.033
- Marry me tonight.
- No.

42:17.159 --> 42:19.452
- No? Why not?
- Because I don't believe you.

42:19.620 --> 42:23.289
If you really wanted to marry me,
you would've done it this afternoon.

42:23.457 --> 42:24.832
Yes, this is the Ali Baba Suite.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.502
I have some bags
that have to be brought down.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.089
Yes, thank you.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.966
You were looking
for a way to get out of this.

42:33.133 --> 42:35.176
I mean, you don't have to be Freud
to figure that one out.

42:35.302 --> 42:37.470
I was not looking!

42:38.973 --> 42:42.850
Listen... You'll be back Monday?

42:42.977 --> 42:44.811
I don't know.
Probably Tuesday or Wednesday.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.980
Tuesday or Wednesday!
That's almost a week!

42:47.147 --> 42:51.150
What, you expect us to fly
back and forth to Hawaii in two days?

42:51.277 --> 42:53.194
"Us"? Already it's "us."

42:53.320 --> 42:55.947
Don't be infantile!
I'm trying to make the best of this!

42:56.073 --> 42:57.991
Well, you're doing great!

43:09.545 --> 43:11.838
Hey, Mr. Straight Flush.
We got a free seat.

43:11.964 --> 43:15.174
- Where's Tommy?
- He just left for Hawaii.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.218
What are you talking about, just left?

43:17.886 --> 43:19.762
The phone rang.
They said the car was ready.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.598
What? He left already?

43:35.195 --> 43:37.113
I don't know about this.

43:40.200 --> 43:43.161
See, you gotta
think about it like this:

43:44.622 --> 43:47.707
You're doing this
to get Jack off the hook.

43:47.875 --> 43:51.794
And your going away makes him realize
how nuts he is about you.

43:51.920 --> 43:55.298
And he appreciates you double
when you come back.

44:00.054 --> 44:03.431
He agreed to this,
so he's got to be... what?

44:03.557 --> 44:05.391
- Ambivalent?
- Yeah. Right.

44:10.606 --> 44:13.900
Stop! No!

44:19.740 --> 44:22.033
Much of the guesswork
is removed from poker

44:22.159 --> 44:26.079
A full house, four of a kind,

44:26.246 --> 44:27.872
or the emperor of all hands:

44:27.998 --> 44:30.750
The invincible,
unbeatable straight flush.

44:54.733 --> 44:57.527
I have to get out of here.

45:41.822 --> 45:43.823
This is amazing.

45:43.991 --> 45:46.325
Ah... Thank you.
I like it.

45:46.452 --> 45:49.495
It's a place
for quiet reflection. Niko...

45:54.460 --> 45:57.712
See, I said to him,
"How's the weather?" in Hawaiian...

45:57.838 --> 46:02.508
and then he said,
"Great. It's in the 80s. Low humidity."

46:02.676 --> 46:06.179
- He doesn't speak English?
- Fluently, thank you.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.639
Welcome to Hawaii.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.850
You know, Mr. Korman
is like a god over here.

46:10.976 --> 46:13.519
Hey, Niko, please.
You're really embarrassing me here.

46:23.822 --> 46:25.740
I don't believe this.

46:28.952 --> 46:32.955
This... This'll be your room.

46:33.081 --> 46:36.876
God, this is breathtaking.

46:37.002 --> 46:40.755
I...
I rebuilt it about a year ago.

46:46.053 --> 46:48.221
My home by the sea.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.723
You can probably
knock off the Hawaiian now.

46:50.849 --> 46:51.849
Oh?

46:51.975 --> 46:55.520
- I've impressed you enough, then?
- More than enough.

46:56.396 --> 46:59.273
God. I've been to the Caribbean...

46:59.399 --> 47:02.485
The Caribbean? You know who goes
to the Caribbean? Dentists.

47:02.611 --> 47:05.029
That's who goes to the Caribbean.

47:05.155 --> 47:08.407
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.328
You know, we have a...

47:13.455 --> 47:17.083
We have a name
for this time of day here.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.960
Waka-waka?

47:19.336 --> 47:21.087
It's close.

47:25.467 --> 47:26.926
Time of enchantment.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.304
What did I tell you?

47:33.225 --> 47:36.602
- You got this in the mail?
- Under my door at home.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.607
Mr. Tomashefsky, it's a joke!

47:41.733 --> 47:43.943
I mean, it's not even close.

47:44.069 --> 47:48.656
Of course you'd say that. You thought I
was nuts when I come in here originally.

47:48.782 --> 47:50.825
Now, I got hard evidence.

47:50.951 --> 47:53.202
Here.
Look for yourself.

47:54.288 --> 47:57.206
Believe me.
I have no ax to grind here.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.878
I think your pals at work
are having a little fun with you.

48:02.004 --> 48:05.172
You don't know what it's like.
You don't know what it's like...

48:05.299 --> 48:07.383
...to have the woman you love
off with someone,

48:07.509 --> 48:10.011
and you can't do
a goddamn thing about it!

48:11.096 --> 48:14.891
Some smooth talker
with his greasy hands all over her!

48:15.809 --> 48:19.812
Coming up behind, grabbing her.
Her, laughing and laughing...

48:19.938 --> 48:21.355
Her head thrown back!

48:22.232 --> 48:25.151
Him... leaning against her...

48:25.277 --> 48:27.653
...this creepy smile on his face.

48:27.821 --> 48:29.572
A smile she can't even see!

48:31.158 --> 48:34.952
Soon, he starts moving his hands
around her...

48:35.746 --> 48:37.121
...grabbing her...

48:37.998 --> 48:39.165
...touching her...

48:40.834 --> 48:43.669
...fondling her, groping...

48:43.837 --> 48:45.421
Shut up!

48:45.547 --> 48:48.007
Are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

50:19.266 --> 50:21.892
Yeah, hi, operator. I need
a listing for a Tommy Korman

50:22.019 --> 50:24.645
or a T. Korman in Kauai.

50:24.771 --> 50:27.273
"Where in Kauai?"
I have no idea.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.525
There are sections of Kauai?

50:29.651 --> 50:30.651
Uh-huh.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.737
Well, no. Not off the top of my head.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.864
What about near where
Don Ho or Jack Lord lives?

50:34.990 --> 50:37.283
That must be
a pretty good neighborhood.

50:37.451 --> 50:41.245
Yeah. OK. I see. Well, thank you!

50:47.502 --> 50:49.754
It's not just because
you look like Donna.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.339
- Oh, it has to be.
- No. It was.

50:52.466 --> 50:54.300
I mean, it was.

50:55.427 --> 50:57.136
But it's not anymore.

50:58.138 --> 51:02.349
I mean, for one thing,
you're a lot smarter than she was.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.769
God forgive me for saying that.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.479
Look. I've got to say
something else too.

51:06.646 --> 51:08.397
You're pissin' your life away

51:08.523 --> 51:10.649
on a guy that can't pull the trigger
on marrying you.

51:10.817 --> 51:13.069
We were gonna get married.

51:13.195 --> 51:16.155
With me, I'd have gone right from the
airport to the chapel to marry you.

51:16.323 --> 51:18.199
- What did he do?
- You have to understand Jack.

51:18.325 --> 51:21.077
This man, he decided to play poker.
That's what this man did.

51:21.203 --> 51:23.537
- He had a very strange mother.
- He played poker.

51:23.663 --> 51:25.456
He's a...

51:26.500 --> 51:29.335
He's a great... a great guy, I'm sure.

51:29.503 --> 51:31.337
I'm just sayin'...

51:32.380 --> 51:35.007
I'm just sayin' think about it
before you marry him.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.551
- Just...
- Hey, Dad! Dad!

51:37.677 --> 51:41.347
- There are the kids.
- How far is Mount Kilauea from here?

51:41.473 --> 51:43.974
It's on the other island. Why?

51:44.684 --> 51:46.227
We heard it's erupting.

51:47.312 --> 51:49.688
We gotta go. We gotta go.

51:49.856 --> 51:51.273
Listen.

51:52.776 --> 51:55.402
Did I upset you?
Because if I did, I...

51:55.529 --> 51:57.822
No. I mean, you touched a nerve.

51:57.948 --> 52:01.325
Look. It's just,
Jack is very complicated.

52:02.202 --> 52:03.702
Yeah.

52:03.870 --> 52:07.081
You see, I've known guys
like him my whole life.

52:07.207 --> 52:09.375
Decent, good guys.
They're real good guys.

52:09.543 --> 52:12.753
But they cause a lot of heartache.

52:14.589 --> 52:16.549
I don't think you deserve that.

52:17.551 --> 52:19.343
I think you deserve a lot better.

52:22.430 --> 52:24.306
Winds out of the northwest
at seven miles per hour.

52:24.432 --> 52:26.433
It's currently cloudy
with a chance of...

52:31.690 --> 52:35.985
Take a look, everybody.
The Oleg Cassini men's...

52:36.111 --> 52:38.154
Mother Nature
put on a show yesterday...

52:38.280 --> 52:40.322
as Hawaii's Mount Kilauea erupted.

52:40.448 --> 52:42.616
We have a report from Connie Wong.

52:45.120 --> 52:47.830
Mount Kilauea,
dormant for the past eight years...

52:47.956 --> 52:50.916
erupted last night
with spectacular force.

52:51.084 --> 52:54.587
Rivers of fire streamed down from
the volcano beginning around midnight,

52:54.713 --> 52:56.922
and word spread quickly
throughout the islands.

52:57.090 --> 52:58.632
Natives and tourists alike

52:58.758 --> 53:00.759
thronged to the base of Mount Kilauea

53:00.886 --> 53:04.597
to watch nature's fury unleashed...
with awe-inspiring force.

53:04.764 --> 53:09.268
Government officials stress no one was
in immediate danger from the eruption.

53:09.394 --> 53:12.813
If I take the 7:00 p.m.,
I get to Milwaukee when?

53:12.939 --> 53:16.275
- 8:35.
- 8:35. And that's Central Time?

53:16.443 --> 53:18.068
Yes, sir.

53:18.195 --> 53:21.614
Now, would it be any cheaper
if I stop in Nashville?

53:21.740 --> 53:24.200
- Same price, sir.
- I hold an AAdvantage card.

53:24.326 --> 53:26.368
That won't make any difference
in the price.

53:26.494 --> 53:28.746
Sir, there seems
to be a very long line.

53:30.457 --> 53:34.210
- Tell me again about the Super Saver.
- There are several restrictions.

53:34.336 --> 53:36.629
What's this guy doing?
Around the world in 80 days?

53:36.796 --> 53:38.505
- Lighten up.
- You lighten up.

53:38.632 --> 53:41.133
You can only fly on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday...

53:41.259 --> 53:44.678
That's it. Look. Look.
I've got a major problem.

53:44.804 --> 53:47.640
OK? My fiancée was kidnapped
and taken to Hawaii.

53:47.807 --> 53:49.850
I've got to get there now.

53:49.976 --> 53:52.645
Well, I'm trying to make arrangements
to get to Milwaukee...

53:52.771 --> 53:55.481
for my nephew Douglas's wedding
on the 21st.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.484
You're not even flying today?

53:58.652 --> 54:00.653
No. Consumer Reports said

54:00.820 --> 54:03.697
if you make your travel arrangements
two weeks in advance at...

54:03.823 --> 54:07.368
You see this line?
We're all flying today.

54:07.494 --> 54:09.912
- Sir, if you don't get back in line...
- Then what?

54:10.038 --> 54:12.665
I'll be arrested? Put in airport jail?

54:12.791 --> 54:16.919
Just get your ticket and move on.
Get your goddamn ticket and move on!

54:17.045 --> 54:18.504
Yeah!

54:27.389 --> 54:30.516
The whole point of the game
was me? Getting me here?

54:31.768 --> 54:34.979
All right.
Why keep it a secret any longer?

54:35.855 --> 54:37.231
My heart's on my sleeve.

54:39.484 --> 54:42.569
From the minute I saw you
in that lobby, I knew...

54:42.696 --> 54:45.698
- So you sort of lied to me.
- How's that?

54:45.865 --> 54:48.617
I understood that this was like
a settlement of the game,

54:48.743 --> 54:50.869
when, in fact, it was
the whole reason for the game.

54:50.996 --> 54:53.706
Yeah. So? Aren't you flattered?

54:53.832 --> 54:56.041
You told me
the game was legitimate.

54:56.209 --> 54:58.544
The game was legitimate.

54:58.712 --> 55:00.879
But, I mean,
I play cards professionally,

55:01.006 --> 55:03.382
and no amateur's gonna beat me.

55:03.550 --> 55:05.884
That's what I had to do to get you.

55:06.011 --> 55:10.389
If I was a medieval knight,
I'd have jostled for you.

55:10.515 --> 55:12.349
Jousted. That's jousted.

55:12.475 --> 55:14.184
Jousted. Whatever the hell they did.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.271
Look, if that is
your preoccupation here...

55:17.397 --> 55:20.482
If you want to leave tomorrow

55:20.608 --> 55:23.527
instead of Wednesday,
believe me, I understand.

55:23.653 --> 55:26.030
I'll call and make reservations.

55:26.156 --> 55:29.074
- No.
- "No?" No calls?

55:29.200 --> 55:31.827
No. No, I'm having a wonderful time.

55:31.953 --> 55:33.829
It's just, you know, this is...

55:33.955 --> 55:37.583
It's just a little overwhelming
to be pursued like this.

55:37.751 --> 55:38.959
Well, no one ever...

55:39.794 --> 55:43.213
...ever was as crazy
about you as I am.

55:44.716 --> 55:47.051
I mean, it's up there with...

55:47.177 --> 55:51.847
...Romeo and Juliet,
George and Gracie... All the big ones.

55:54.351 --> 55:56.352
I'll take care of you forever.

55:56.478 --> 55:58.854
I would throw myself
in front of a train for you.

56:06.529 --> 56:08.697
Just stop me at any time.

56:19.334 --> 56:22.628
Was that wrong?
It didn't feel wrong to me.

56:24.714 --> 56:28.884
I don't know.

56:31.137 --> 56:33.180
It's OK, honey.
Let me see here.

56:33.306 --> 56:35.808
- What are you doing?
- She's got a great spitball.

56:35.975 --> 56:39.144
That's a tremendous natural athlete.

56:39.270 --> 56:40.771
- Yeah?
- Telephone, Mr. K.

56:40.897 --> 56:42.773
- Do you want to hold her?
- Yes.

56:42.899 --> 56:44.775
- Can I hold you?
- Yes.

56:44.901 --> 56:47.986
Oh, hey. That's great
how she goes to you like that.

56:48.154 --> 56:50.531
I can't believe it. She doesn't
go to people like that.

56:50.657 --> 56:51.907
Gimme.

56:57.997 --> 56:58.997
What's the story?

56:59.124 --> 57:02.835
Bad news.
He's on the morning flight in.

57:04.003 --> 57:06.588
I'm surprised
and I'm not surprised.

57:07.674 --> 57:12.803
Look. All right. We gotta keep him
away from here for at least a day.

57:13.471 --> 57:15.055
How 'bout a nice hit-and-run?

57:17.016 --> 57:18.684
Look, no violence.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.270
Unless it's absolutely
necessary, all right?

57:21.396 --> 57:24.440
Just stall,
and get the chief. Get Mahi.

57:24.566 --> 57:26.358
Just take care of it.

57:27.694 --> 57:30.988
Look, I'm getting very close
with her, you know?

57:31.114 --> 57:34.032
And if he shows up over here,
it's over, and...

57:34.159 --> 57:36.869
Are you goddamn eating again?

57:38.538 --> 57:40.664
No, I swear, I'm not eatin'.

57:47.672 --> 57:49.298
He checked out Sunday?

57:49.424 --> 57:51.425
At 8:07.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.427
Can I help you
with any future reservations?

57:53.553 --> 57:55.596
- No, thank you.
- Thank you for calling Bally's.

58:08.401 --> 58:10.986
Come on, come on, come on.

58:12.071 --> 58:13.614
Hi, this is Jack Singer.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.365
Sorry I can't take your call now,

58:15.492 --> 58:20.078
but if you'd leave your name
and number, I'll get right back to you.

58:22.207 --> 58:23.373
Shit!

58:41.100 --> 58:43.602
Hey, Mahi,
will you pay some attention?

58:44.938 --> 58:46.813
This guy, Jack Singer's
six-one, about 180.

58:46.940 --> 58:48.315
He's coming out of that terminal.

58:48.441 --> 58:50.150
Keep him away from Tommy's all right?

58:50.276 --> 58:53.153
I don't care where you take him.
Just keep him away from Tommy's.

58:53.279 --> 58:55.280
- Sure.
- All right, Mahi.

59:03.831 --> 59:06.458
Hey, brother, you like ride?

59:06.626 --> 59:09.294
Yeah, I need a ride,
but I don't know where yet.

59:09.420 --> 59:10.837
- I take your bag.
- Thanks.

59:10.964 --> 59:13.131
My name Mahi.
Mahi Mahi.

59:13.258 --> 59:15.801
- Like the fish?
- Yeah. My father was a fisherman.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.762
My father left home when I was five.
That's why I'm named Jack.

59:18.930 --> 59:21.431
As in "Jack, tell your mother
I'm going to get the paper."

59:21.558 --> 59:24.268
- I gotta make a couple calls.
- Hey, Jack, Jack.

59:24.394 --> 59:26.311
Where you like go?
Tell me. I take you anywhere.

59:26.479 --> 59:30.482
Do you have any idea where a guy
named Tommy Korman lives?

59:30.608 --> 59:33.235
Sure. Everybody know that.

59:33.361 --> 59:34.653
You're kidding?

59:34.821 --> 59:38.323
- No, it's a small island.
- This is great.

59:39.242 --> 59:41.243
Thought I was going to have
to go through a whole number.

59:41.369 --> 59:43.078
- Cab's over here.
- All right.

59:43.204 --> 59:44.580
Welcome to Kauai.

59:50.670 --> 59:51.753
You like this, Jack?

59:51.879 --> 59:55.549
Beautiful, huh? So romantic.

59:55.675 --> 59:58.302
The women, when they come here,
oh, they get crazy.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.429
They like "freaky-freaky"
all night long.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.514
That's really great news.
We almost there?

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.559
Yeah. Right up here
about a mile and a half.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:27.497
This can't be it.
Tommy Korman lives here?

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.957
Korman?

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.627
I thought you said "Orman."
You know, Chief Orman.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.629
I didn't say Chief Orman.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:36.882
I said Tommy Korman,
loud and clear. Come on!

01:00:37.008 --> 01:00:40.636
I fly for two goddamn days,
I haven't slept, I can barely walk!

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:53.065
That goes double for me, chief.
There was a little mix-up here.

01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:01.323
Listen, Mahi.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:03.617
I don't have time
for this horseshit!

01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:07.913
Hey, Jack, no make insult
for the chief, OK?

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:09.998
This man get plenty influence
in this place.

01:01:10.124 --> 01:01:12.459
"Influence"?
He lives in a shack!

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.421
He's a man of great simplicity.

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.676
Come on. You spend
ten minutes with the guy, OK?

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:24.346
If you don't do that, the word
gonna get around Kauai so fast.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:27.724
Next thing you know,
ain't nobody gonna help you, brother.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:35.524
- Parakeet brandy.
- Are you serious?

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.790
- You are from mainland?
- That's right.

01:01:52.917 --> 01:01:54.960
Do you find Chief Orman attractive?

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:02.634
Uh... You're
a striking-looking figure.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.095
If by "attractive"...

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.555
Hey, chief.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:09.641
He looking for a man
named Tommy Korman.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.309
If you know where he is...

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:14.271
Have you seen the musical
Grand Hotel?

01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:18.775
I... I don't go
to the theater that often.

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.319
Do you know if it
will come to Kauai?

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.407
I don't, really, but I'll
ask around when I get back.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.242
Now, could you tell me...

01:02:27.368 --> 01:02:29.327
Did you hear me before
about Tommy Korman?

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:35.000

of course, South Pacific.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:40.672

01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:03.862
- Great to see you again.
- Thanks. How are you?

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.322
Real good. Doin' real good.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.199
This is Betsy.
This is my friend Nahoo.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:10.202
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nahoo, Betsy. See you.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:13.955
Bye-bye. Striking resemblance
to the first Mrs. Korman.

♪ Come to me
Come to me

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:46.571
Orman getting senile.
Used to do only one number.

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:48.865
- Get me to a phone.
- Now?

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.117
Right now.
You have a problem with that?

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:55.747
No, no. Just, on this side,
so many beautiful things to see.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.082
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.043
We got the five reflecting pools
of Maaoma.

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.087
The five pools are here?

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.630
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

01:04:03.756 --> 01:04:05.882
- Come. We go.
- What are we waiting for?

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.426
- Oh, shit!
- What?

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:10.971
My keys must have fallen out
when I was in the bathroom.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:14.099
- Could you do me a monster favor?
- No worry nothing. I get 'em.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.767
You're the best.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:18.353
- Everybody here is so friendly.
- Hey!

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.454
Don't say anything.

01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:39.040
This wasn't Donna's?

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.419
What? God, no.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.006
This is, uh, Betsy's.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.676
It's so beautiful.

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:52.053
Really, I mean...

01:04:52.179 --> 01:04:55.390
I've never gotten
anything remotely like this.

01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:58.476
I just... I can't accept it.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:03.064
I want to marry you.
I mean, like, tomorrow.

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.192
I can't just marry you.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.944
Why not?
'Cause we just met?

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.614
Well, yes.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.159
Look... Just listen to me.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.495
You know, life is so...
what... very short.

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:19.956
We all think too much.

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:23.710
We don't act on our,
you know, impulses.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.963
Korman's address is near Kapaa?

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:30.926
Is it "Kapa-a-a" or "Kapa-a-a-a"?

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:34.429
Is it two "A"s?
Is it A-A-A or A-A?

01:05:34.555 --> 01:05:36.514
Two "A"s. OK, thank you.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:37.974
No, I'm in Waimea.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.186
Listen... I have to get back
to my real life.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:43.730
This is just way too much
for me to handle.

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:47.943
- Betsy, I love you.
- Tommy...

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:52.113
Oh. I want you in my life.
I want to be married.

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:56.117
- I can't marry you like this.
- Like what?

01:05:56.243 --> 01:05:58.870
Like this.
Like just jumping into it.

01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:01.498
It just doesn't make any sense,
and there's Jack, too.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.542
I can't just turn around
and marry someone else.

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:07.128
There's stuff to work out with him.
There's feelings there.

01:06:10.883 --> 01:06:12.008
What?

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:17.138
The man put you up
in a card game.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.308
No, not really.
You made an arrangement.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.186
I wanted cash. He put you up.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.731
What are you talking about?

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.485
Mr. Korman and Miss Nolan
are where exactly?

01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:33.279
The Kauai Club.
It's about 20 miles down this road.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:36.574
- Thanks very much.
- Are you a friend of Dad's or Betsy's?

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:38.243
Both, actually.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.328
They're really great together.

01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:42.247
It's so good to see Chris's dad in love.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:45.083
Yeah, well, that's just
so wonderful to hear.

01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:47.544
- OK.
- Goodbye.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.922
I thought that it was your idea.
You told me that you arranged a game.

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:54.426
- You saw me in the lobby...
- Yes, honey. Listen.

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:57.095
I told you that to protect you.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:00.598
Because I love you so very much.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.686
Honey, and the truth was so...

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.397
...horrible!

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.691
It embarrassed me.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:11.943
He put you up like a...

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.612
...like a ring, like a watch.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.531
That's how cold it was.

01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:18.533
I can't believe it.
Maybe he was frantic.

01:07:18.659 --> 01:07:21.786
Listen, people get frightened.
They do crazy things.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:24.289
He was so terrified
of marrying you.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:27.834
Come on, that's unfair.
He didn't have $65,000.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.502
What...

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:32.464
That's what he owed you.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.135
He owed me $3,000.

01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:40.972
What?

01:07:42.808 --> 01:07:44.267
Honey, look.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:48.021
The man's a head case. He's a head case.

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.690
But we all make mistakes.
Life goes on.

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.984
He did this for $3,000?

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:55.820
Honey, don't. Please, darling.

01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:57.906
Don't torture yourself like this.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:00.241
Let's just fly to Vegas and...

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:02.869
...get married
and go on with our lives.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:05.789
I need to be alone for awhile.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.845
Keep it close by.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:34.192
Betsy!

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.197
Betsy!

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.533
Betsy!

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:48.540
Get off!

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.959
Get off me!

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:52.877
What the hell are you doing here?
We had a deal.

01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:55.130
We never said Hawaii.
Get off me.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.340
We never didn't say Hawaii.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.425
Look, you want to stay
on the island, fine.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:02.511
But you stay the hell away
from her or give me 65 thousand.

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:03.638
I've got it.

01:09:03.764 --> 01:09:05.265
I brought it with me.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.559
No. That's bullshit.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.228
You never wanted the money.
You wanted her!

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:14.232
Get off me! Somebody!

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:16.067
Help! Get off me!

01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:18.027
- Betsy!
- He's crazy!

01:09:19.196 --> 01:09:20.321
Betsy!

01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:23.908
- Get him out of here!
- Betsy!

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:26.077
Betsy!

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.714
Come on. Don't.
You're making a big mistake.

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:41.926
Listen to me.
My girl's out there. My wife!

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.145
You OK?

01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:56.399
- That was the weirdest thing.
- What?

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.193
It was like Wuthering Heights.

01:09:58.319 --> 01:10:00.570
I thought I heard my name
being called in the wind.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.572
It sounded like Jack.
Can you believe that?

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:07.493
Yeah. I used to think
that I heard Donna calling...

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.329
Almost shouting.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:11.748
It's very spooky.

01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:16.044
It's the shape of the rocks
or something. It echoes.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.254
- It's so strange.
- Yeah.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.552
So what do you think?

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:28.431
I'm gonna want children very soon.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.314
You just tell me when, sweetheart.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.568
Having children
with you would be heaven.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.821
Then let's do it. I want to.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.951
Are you sure this is not
a reaction to what I told you?

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.912
No, no, I want
to get on with my life, Tommy.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:52.455
I want to get married.

01:10:53.874 --> 01:10:54.874
To me?

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:58.002
Yes.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.219
I'm shakin' like a leaf.

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.370
Look, I have to make
a phone call now!

01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:36.708
You're kidding me!
You're in a Hawaiian clink?

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:40.628
- Vito, you believe that?
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:42.505
Vito's in the chair.
He can't believe it.

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.174
Listen. The bail is five grand.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.176
OK, let me work on it.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.553
But, Jack, listen to me.

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:51.055
Make sure you ask approval
to leave the state.

01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:53.224
Otherwise you'll be stuck there
even if you make bail.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:56.978
OK, but, Sally,
as fast as you can, please.

01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:59.564
Just seeing her there,
staring at the ocean...

01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:02.025
I know that look, man.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.235
She's doing some serious thinking.

01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:06.112
Well? Ready?

01:12:06.238 --> 01:12:08.656
This is really such a great spot.

01:12:08.782 --> 01:12:10.783
We'll be back real soon.

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:22.003
- Thanks.
- I want to say one thing, ma'am.

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:24.255
Anybody who would put you up
for $3,000...

01:12:24.381 --> 01:12:26.549
Hey, Niko,
what's the matter with you?

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:29.385
- Sorry.
- That's all right. Really.

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.512
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:35.933
Perfect.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:56.579
Don't tell me
you still want the cab fare.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:13:01.209
Nah. I dropped the charges.
I feel sorry for you, man.

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:04.962
I don't want your pity.
Just take me to Korman's house. Korman.

01:13:06.673 --> 01:13:08.549
No do you any good.

01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:10.760
Him, your girlfriend,
both went back Vegas.

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:11.886
Gonna get married.

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:14.472
Married?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.224
Married.

01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:22.605
Hey, Jack.

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:25.483
Jack, Jack.

01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:28.194
- Good luck, brother. Hey.
- Thanks.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:39.664
It means, "Always have the good words
come out of your mouth."

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:42.500
That just doesn't help me at all,
but I appreciate the thought.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.043
Aloha, brother!

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:51.175
Hello.

01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:53.136
I gotta get on
the next flight out of here.

01:13:54.304 --> 01:13:57.181
The next flight out of here
goes nonstop to...

01:13:57.349 --> 01:13:58.641
Auckland, New Zealand.

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:01.644
New Zealand?
No, I gotta get to the States.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.187
We are a state.

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:06.858
The mainland, OK?
I gotta get to Vegas.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.529
Well, the Los Angeles flight
left Honolulu 20 minutes ago.

01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:12.864
Shit!

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:16.784
- When's the next flight out of here?
- Tonight at 8:30.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:21.664
Ma'am, I'll be sucking
on an exhaust pipe by then.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:26.002
Just get me anywhere where I can get
a connecting flight to Las Vegas.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:28.713
Devil in Disguise)

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.811
You know, you shouldn't live...
...where Donna lived.

01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:45.938
I don't think that's fair.

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.858
So, I was thinkin'...

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:53.321
...we buy a place
in Westchester or Connecticut.

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:55.448
I can't think about that yet.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.660
That's OK. I'll think about it.

01:14:59.786 --> 01:15:02.747
You sit back and you relax.
OK, sweetheart?

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.671
Congratulations to the two of you.

01:15:10.797 --> 01:15:12.256
Penthouse A is ready.

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:14.467
That's great, Bud. I appreciate it.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.971
Mr. Korman's getting married.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:26.229
Don't take too long with the makeup.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.272
I like you au naturel.

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:31.108
Don't worry.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:34.070
You don't need any, anyway.

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:46.040
He left Kauai.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:48.376
But he couldn't get an LA flight.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:49.835
So where is he?

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.588
- San Jose.
- San Jose...

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.758
San Jose. Well...

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.386
Who do we know
at the airport in San Jose?

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:01.138
- Frankie Cargo.
- Give him a phone call.

01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:02.807
Go on.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.272
- This flight is history?
- Yes.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.232
Apparently there's
bad weather in El Paso.

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.068
- Hail the size of golf balls.
- I don't care about El Paso.

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:16.529
- How do I get to Vegas?
- Well, let's see.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:19.657
There's a 9:00 p.m. flight
into Los Angeles.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:22.577
It arrives at 10:15...

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:26.747
And then you can just take
a 12:35 flight into Vegas.

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:28.874
- That's it?
- Until tomorrow morning, yes.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.001
Oh, man.

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:34.005
Attention, Pakistani,
Indian and Malaysian Elvises:

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:37.425
Your bus to the Grand Canyon
is leaving in eight minutes.

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:40.219
...when the beeper goes off. Thanks.

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:46.058
Hi, Jack, it's me.
I'm back in Vegas with Tommy.

01:16:46.184 --> 01:16:50.146
I tried you when I was in Hawaii,
but you were never there, so...

01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:53.899
Look, Jack, here's the thing. I don't
know why you lied to me about the game.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.694
All right? I don't know,
but I suppose I can guess.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.946
The worst part about this
is I don't know where you are.

01:16:59.072 --> 01:17:00.990
I don't know and I can't
speak to you direc...

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:05.828
Ladies and gentlemen.
For your convenience,

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.205
we have immediate seating available...

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:11.876
I'll go crack open the champagne.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.211
Are you always
going to keep me waiting?

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:15.838
That's a joke.

01:17:16.923 --> 01:17:18.883
You can keep me waiting anytime.

01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:23.679
Vegas! Anybody going to Vegas?

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.890
Las Vegas! Anybody!

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:27.850
Anybody, Vegas!

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:31.103
Are you guys going to Vegas
by any chance?

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:33.230
Yeah! We sure are. You need a lift?

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:36.025
- Oh, desperately.
- You done this before, son?

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:39.070
Yeah, yeah, sure. I love
these little planes. They're great.

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:41.989
Oh, come on. Hop aboard.
You'll have a good time.

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:43.824
We got a new one, boys.

01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:46.077
Come on in there.
Let's go. Let's go!

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.247
Could we talk?

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:52.875
- Sure, we could talk.
- No, back inside.

01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:55.586
Please?

01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:16.899
You ready, Zeke?

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:18.984
Ready!

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:22.279
Hey, all right.
What's your cape size, son?

01:18:22.447 --> 01:18:25.491
- What's my cape size?
- Uh-huh.

01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:26.617
Forty regular.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:28.577
What's with the parachutes?

01:18:29.913 --> 01:18:33.207
You're gonna find out as soon as
you strap one on, I guarantee you.

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:36.794
For such a short flight, it seems
like you're being overcautious.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:39.338
I don't know. It's just a hunch, but...

01:18:39.464 --> 01:18:41.632
Son, we're skydivin'.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.135
You're skydiving?

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:47.138
We're the Flying Elvises,
Utah chapter.

01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:49.849
Roy Bacon, director, at your service.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.851
Listen, if you could just drop me.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.103
Oh, yeah, we'll sure drop you!

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:01.652
This is a panic attack.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.155
Why does it have to be so soon?

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:08.993
Well, honey, you know,
I told you there comes a time when...

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.911
I'm not ready.

01:19:11.037 --> 01:19:13.414
Nah. You just think you're not ready.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.666
No, I'm not ready.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:19.462
I say we wait a few weeks.
You know? A month.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.006
We, we get to know each other better.

01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:30.014
OK... Look, I'll give you
half a million dollars

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.348
if you marry me today. Cash.

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:35.728
And if things don't work out,
we split up, you keep the money.

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:38.355
You're joking.

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:41.025
About money, I, I neverjoke.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.861
Screw you.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:50.993
Please. Don't ever turn
your back on me. Ever.

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:52.703
Weekend is over.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.790
Don't grab me like that.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.919
You are being rude to me.

01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:05.132
In the lobby of the Bally Hotel,
you are being rude.

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:07.885
Get out of my sight.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:09.595
Hey!

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:13.891
A million. Now, be a realist.

01:20:14.017 --> 01:20:16.018
This is a no-lose deal for you.

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.145
I get a million dollars?

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.397
Yeah. That's correct.

01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:22.691
You're unbelievable.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:26.195
It would be very irresponsible
of you to turn this down.

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:27.988
- Tommy...
- Hey.

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:30.991
Your answer...

01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:32.409
...is yes.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.914
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:41.085
OK, come on.
I'll go with you.

01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:43.462
I need to be alone
for a couple of minutes.

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:51.345
OK. You got five minutes,
and then we get married.

01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:52.763
Listen.

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:58.978
You said, "Yes, I will marry you."

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:01.730
That's a promise.

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:07.194
When people make promises
to Tommy Korman, they keep 'em.

01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:09.738
You understand?

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:13.033
- Yes, I do. Yes.
- Hmm?

01:21:18.456 --> 01:21:20.082
You got five minutes.

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:32.845
She's comin' up here?

01:21:34.472 --> 01:21:35.639
I thought you left already.

01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:38.100
No. Just stay close to her,
all right?

01:21:43.106 --> 01:21:44.273
Where is he?

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:09.214
Ooh, boy, that music
gets the adrenaline going, don't it?

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.717
- We jump out at what altitude?
- Three thousand feet.

01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:15.346
And these chutes are foolproof, right?

01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:17.431
Well, as the King his own self said...

01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:19.558
they ain't nothin' in this
whole wide world foolproof,

01:22:19.684 --> 01:22:22.478
exceptin' Coupe DeVilles and hookers!

01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:27.024
Let me get this straight.
I pull this?

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.693
No, boy, you pull
the other one first,

01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:31.362
that being your main chute.

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:35.032
Then if that chute don't open,
you reach over and pull the red one,

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.493
that there being your auxiliary chute.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.203
Yellow, then red. Yellow, then red.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:41.747
- You got it.
- OK, OK. Now...

01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:45.376
lf, by any chance, I get flustered
when I'm hurtling through space...

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:47.461
and I pull the red one first?

01:22:47.587 --> 01:22:50.506
Oh! Then you gonna wind up
lookin' like a well-done chili burger.

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.925
They gonna have to
shovel you into a coffin.

01:22:55.762 --> 01:22:58.389
But you can do it, son. You can do it!

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:02.267
All right, fellers.
It's just about show time!

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:04.395
Yellow, then red.
Yellow, then red.

01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:31.588
She never came up.

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.301
- Go find her.
- Where?

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:39.847
I don't know. Try outside.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:43.600
Six minutes until the Flying
Elvises make their historic jump.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:51.900
Elvises, rise!

01:23:54.612 --> 01:23:56.780
Yellow, then red.
Yellow, then red.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:59.324
Yellow, then red. Yellow, then red.
Yellow, then red. Yellow, then red.

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:09.877
Where you going?

01:24:12.672 --> 01:24:15.632
Ladies and gentlemen
Roy Bacon and his Flying Elvises

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:17.134
are approaching Bally's.

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.720
- All eyes to the sky!
- Elvis!

01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:36.737
OK, OK.

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:54.129
She's somewhere in the basement.

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.340
So, tell me, what are you
doing in the lobby?

01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:59.259
- I'm keeping you informed.
- Go get her! Go get her!

01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:03.639
Moron.

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:07.101
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Flying Elvises

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:11.146
have entered Las Vegas airspace
and will jump in one minute!

01:25:11.564 --> 01:25:12.564
One minute!

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.370
Elvises, light your fires!

01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:30.207
Betsy! Betsy! Betsy! Betsy!

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:32.000
That's it.
Look at them up there!

01:25:37.423 --> 01:25:41.885
Elvises, head 'em up
and move 'em out!

01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:57.025
Here they come!

01:25:57.902 --> 01:25:59.903
Excuse me.

01:26:00.029 --> 01:26:03.824
Never before have so many
Elvises been airborne!

01:26:10.373 --> 01:26:13.041
Let's give them
a real Las Vegas welcome

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.919
and pray that they make it
safely to Earth.

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:21.884
You know you pull the red one,
then the yellow one!

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.469
No, he said yellow, then red!

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.096
No! He was just kidding!

01:26:26.222 --> 01:26:27.431
Lyle, come on, Lyle!

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:29.683
- Good luck!
- Wait a minute!

01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:33.478
- I was just kidding.
- You were or Roy was?

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:34.771
He was.

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:39.651
Our brave Elvises of the sky

01:26:39.777 --> 01:26:42.696
are wearing specially designed
electric jumpsuits

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:46.241
made to the King's
own specifications.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:50.370
Each suit is valued
at over $10,000.

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:54.541
Here they come!

01:26:54.667 --> 01:26:56.835
They're crossing the Dunes.

01:26:56.961 --> 01:26:59.963
Then they're headed home to Bally's.

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:10.515
One last time! Yellow, then red?

01:27:14.854 --> 01:27:16.438
Betsy! Betsy! Betsy! Betsy!

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:28.158
Yee-haw!

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.328
Roy Bacon has opened his chute.

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:33.247
Only one to go!

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:37.251
Yellow! Red! Pow!

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:41.129
The last chute is open!

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.219
That's good. That's great.

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:49.137
I'm not gonna die.

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.224
Don't look down.

01:27:55.478 --> 01:27:58.272
Here comes our first Elvis to Earth.

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:01.441
Tommy Joe Smithers
of Provo, Utah.

01:28:03.027 --> 01:28:06.530
Our second Elvis,
from Elko, Nevada...

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:07.906
Walter Peeblinger!

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:12.494
God, don't let me land
on anything sharp.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.664
Left, toggle left.
Right, toggle right.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.875
The wind currents are picking up!

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:22.754
Watch it up there,
brave Elvises of the sky!

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880
Steady, boy.

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.341
Here we go.

01:28:27.218 --> 01:28:28.885
That's good. OK.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:32.764
Here they come.
From Tucson, Billy Braker!

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:36.476
From Salt Lake City,
Lyle Davis and Vern Poole.

01:28:36.602 --> 01:28:40.063
And our newest Flying Elvis
from New York City...

01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:43.734
making his maiden jump,
Jack Singer!

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.862
Let's give a real
Las Vegas welcome

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:51.241
for our heroic young man,
Jack Singer!

01:28:54.245 --> 01:28:58.373
Welcome to Earth,
brave Elvises!

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:00.042
- Miss, stay back.
- Please.

01:29:04.881 --> 01:29:05.881
Jack!

01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:09.009
- Betsy!
- Jack!

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:17.684
Betsy!

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:22.606
Did you marry him?

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:39.122
Jack! You jumped out of a plane!

01:29:39.248 --> 01:29:41.625
His kid said you were gonna
marry him today.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:43.377
Did you get a job here?

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:46.421
I couldn't find you.
I didn't know how to reach you.

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:49.091
I was flying day and night.
I was going everywhere.

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:53.261
Hawaii, jail... I saw you on the beach.
I was screaming your name.

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:55.305
He said that was the wind.

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:57.140
I was so stupid.

01:30:02.021 --> 01:30:03.397
I can't find her.

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:08.777
It's over. Son of a bitch
jumped out of a plane.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:09.986
What?

01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:13.615
He said you only lost 3,000.

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:15.492
- What?
- And I believed him.

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:20.163
Then I realized, I said,
"What, am I nuts? I can't marry him."

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.250
Elvis!

01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:28.130
And then you jumped
out of a plane for me!

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:29.673
You could've died.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.259
I didn't want to live
if I couldn't have you, baby.

01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:37.347
Go take a hike.

01:30:37.473 --> 01:30:39.391
- Now?
- No, next Thursday.

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:41.977
Yeah, now. Go set up a game.

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.687
I'll just grab a bite.

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:47.607
- Go!
- All right, all right.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:51.194
I dreamt about my mother again
last night.

01:30:51.362 --> 01:30:52.988
Was she vacuuming naked?

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.615
No. She opened her eyes, and I said,

01:30:55.741 --> 01:31:00.078
"Mom, I'm gonna marry that girl,"
and she smiled.

01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:02.372
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.874
Of course, she was naked.

01:31:06.502 --> 01:31:09.379
Jack and Betsy,
you have declared your desire

01:31:09.547 --> 01:31:12.215
to unite yourselves
with each other in marriage.

01:31:12.341 --> 01:31:15.010
- This is correct?
- Yes.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.553
True matrimony is...

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:30.025
Oh.

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:37.073
Yee-haw! Whoo!

01:34:10.936 --> 01:34:13.521
Devil in Disguise)
