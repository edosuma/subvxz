WEBVTT

00:08.990 --> 00:10.580
- Hey, Sam. How's...
- Wait!

00:10.690 --> 00:11.680
(GROANS)

00:11.790 --> 00:13.090
Oh. Sorry.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.860
What the hell was that?

00:16.970 --> 00:19.090
Force shield. Didn't you see my sign?

00:19.200 --> 00:20.690
No!

00:21.500 --> 00:22.940
Yes!

00:24.510 --> 00:26.200
You mean this sign?

00:27.080 --> 00:30.010
- That was supposed to be on the...
- Yeah. I got that.

00:31.910 --> 00:34.610
Is there any particular reason
why you turned this place into Fort Knox?

00:34.720 --> 00:37.410
I'm attempting to rewrite
the safety protocols on Merlin's device

00:37.520 --> 00:39.920
so we can take even larger areas
out of phase.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.280
I set up a two-way force shield
to restrict the range of the device

00:43.390 --> 00:46.420
and to ensure that nobody
entered the field accidentally.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.290
Yeah. Very effective.

00:49.230 --> 00:50.930
Any news on Daniel?

00:51.430 --> 00:54.300
No. The latest sighting by the Jaffa
turned out to be a false alarm,

00:54.400 --> 00:57.500
but Teal'c just got back,
so we're going to grab some lunch

00:57.610 --> 00:58.830
and go over the report.

00:58.940 --> 01:00.460
Okay, just let me run one more test.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.440
- No.
- It'll only take a minute, I promise.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.340
You can watch from up there.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.570
I am going to be timing you.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.770
(WHOOSHING)

01:30.240 --> 01:33.300
(HIGH PITCHED RUMBLING)

01:48.160 --> 01:50.820
<i>Sam, I know you can hear me. Time's up.</i>

01:56.160 --> 01:57.190
Sam?

02:02.240 --> 02:03.830
(ALARMS BLARING)

02:17.790 --> 02:20.650
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

02:26.260 --> 02:27.690
Major...

02:27.900 --> 02:30.330
Are you okay? We...
We heard an explosion.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.520
Yeah, I'm fine...
Did you just call me "Major"?

02:34.570 --> 02:38.800
Sam. Thank God you're okay.
Where's Dr. Bennet?

02:39.170 --> 02:41.270
Major Lorne, what are you doing here?

02:41.410 --> 02:42.740
What do you mean?

02:42.840 --> 02:45.240
You're supposed to be on Atlantis.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.810
Sam, what are you talking about?

02:48.720 --> 02:51.510
You're on assignment
in the Pegasus Galaxy.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.880
Are you sure you're okay?
Because I work here, remember?

02:58.360 --> 03:00.020
As leader of SG-1.

04:11.070 --> 04:14.060
- General, we have a problem.
- What is it, Major?

04:14.170 --> 04:18.130
I'm not exactly sure how to explain it, sir,
but there's been an accident.

04:18.310 --> 04:19.530
It's Sam.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.770
She claims she's not
the Major Carter we know.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.850
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She says she's from a parallel universe.

04:25.950 --> 04:29.380
- And given the nature of the experiment...
- Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.950
You said there was an explosion.
Was she injured?

04:32.650 --> 04:35.250
Not a scratch, sir,
but she does seem different.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.690
- Different how?
- Well, for one thing,

04:36.790 --> 04:38.320
she claims she's a lieutenant colonel,

04:38.430 --> 04:40.660
and she does have this device with her
I've never seen before.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.390
We have no idea where that came from.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.900
All right, assuming for the moment
she's telling the truth,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.900
where's our Major Carter?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.330
We don't know.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.060
- Find out.
- Yes, sir.

04:52.810 --> 04:55.110
LORNE: So...

04:55.210 --> 04:56.700
Why are you here?

04:56.810 --> 04:59.410
I didn't do it on purpose, believe me.

05:00.150 --> 05:03.050
What about that machine
you brought with you?

05:03.480 --> 05:07.110
It demolecularizes matter
and transports it to another dimension.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.130
- Well, there you go.
- No, no, this is different.

05:11.230 --> 05:12.490
Look, according to M-theory,

05:12.590 --> 05:15.030
there are a fixed number
of alternate dimensions

05:15.130 --> 05:17.500
existing in parallel
with our known universe.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.930
The multiverse theory, on the other hand,

05:19.030 --> 05:22.300
posits the existence of an infinite number
of alternate universes,

05:22.400 --> 05:25.100
each evolving concurrently with our own.

05:25.370 --> 05:26.700
Well, is there a universe
out there somewhere

05:26.810 --> 05:29.400
where you're giving me a straight answer?

05:29.510 --> 05:34.110
Look, there must be some reason
why I was brought here, of all places.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.980
I need to know
what was happening in that lab.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.140
I'm not authorized
to give you that information.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.020
Okay, maybe I could talk to Daniel.
Is he here?

05:43.560 --> 05:47.960
Dr. Jackson was captured by
the forces of the Ori several weeks ago.

05:49.060 --> 05:52.360
Okay. What about Colonel Mitchell?

05:53.070 --> 05:54.660
Cameron Mitchell?

05:54.770 --> 05:56.790
What, the 302 pilot
that went down over Antarctica?

05:56.900 --> 05:58.600
That's right. Is he here?

05:58.710 --> 06:00.200
I have no idea where he is.

06:00.310 --> 06:02.970
The last I heard, he quit the military.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.970
Teal'c? Vala?

06:05.980 --> 06:07.780
Teal'c went back to the Jaffa
several years ago,

06:07.880 --> 06:10.040
and if you're talking about Vala Mal Doran,

06:10.150 --> 06:11.450
I hate to break it to you,

06:11.550 --> 06:14.280
but she is currently
occupying a cell at Area 51.

06:14.390 --> 06:16.860
Care to take a stab at anyone else?

06:19.130 --> 06:21.320
At least let me see
the surveillance footage from the lab.

06:21.430 --> 06:23.160
There may be a clue.

06:25.230 --> 06:28.630
Look, I know you want your Carter back
as much as I want to go home,

06:28.740 --> 06:32.830
<i>but we stand a much better chance</i>
<i>of figuring this out if we work together.</i>

06:34.610 --> 06:36.410
Show her the footage.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.480
<i>We're getting a power spike.</i>

06:43.620 --> 06:46.590
<i>Capacitors are overloading. Shut it down.</i>

06:50.090 --> 06:53.320
<i>- Override's not responding!</i>
<i>- Bennet, get out of here!</i>

06:56.400 --> 06:58.230
That's all we got.

07:00.270 --> 07:03.100
Sensors indicate there was
a massive explosion in the room,

07:03.200 --> 07:06.470
but when we opened the door,
instead of finding charred remains,

07:06.570 --> 07:08.010
we found you.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.370
What were the capacitors for?

07:13.950 --> 07:16.210
Major Carter was developing a process

07:16.320 --> 07:20.010
by which we could extract energy
from parallel universes.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.290
And you knew about this?

07:23.760 --> 07:27.490
Knowing and understanding are
two totally different things.

07:27.630 --> 07:31.060
Ordinarily, this type of energy retrieval
is extremely dangerous,

07:31.170 --> 07:34.730
leading to the creation of exotic particles
in one or both universes.

07:34.840 --> 07:37.330
- I know. We've tried it.
- Oh.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.370
Well, our Major Carter
found a way around that.

07:41.580 --> 07:44.880
She designed the machine so the bridge
would only open for a microsecond.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.070
The idea was to steal
small amounts of energy

07:47.180 --> 07:48.840
from thousands of different universes,

07:48.950 --> 07:52.080
thereby minimizing the fallout
in any single one.

07:52.220 --> 07:56.210
Anyway, it doesn't entirely explain
how you got here.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.750
That's true.

07:57.860 --> 08:01.520
The device was never designed to bring
ordinary matter through the bridge.

08:01.630 --> 08:03.960
Well, I was conducting
an experiment of my own.

08:04.070 --> 08:06.860
At the precise moment that your Carter
tapped into my reality,

08:06.970 --> 08:09.490
the entire contents of my lab
were out of phase,

08:09.600 --> 08:12.660
and they were being protected
by a force shield.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.340
Oh, my God.

08:14.910 --> 08:17.100
What... I mean, there's no telling
what effect that would have

08:17.210 --> 08:18.580
on the inter-universal bridge.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.740
Well, presumably, it pulled me through

08:20.850 --> 08:23.320
and caused the capacitors on this side
to overload.

08:24.520 --> 08:25.850
If it brought you here,

08:25.950 --> 08:28.720
is it possible that it sent
our Carter to your universe?

08:31.990 --> 08:34.480
I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.

08:42.970 --> 08:45.400
- General.
- I need to see the President.

08:45.770 --> 08:48.870
- He's on a call. Can it wait?
- No.

08:53.710 --> 08:56.440
- General Hammond.
- Colonel.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.680
- You're in command here?
- That's right.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.280
I'm sorry, sir, it's just a little strange.

09:02.390 --> 09:04.790
The General Hammond I know
is retired from active service.

09:05.230 --> 09:07.790
Well, then, he's a lucky man. Please.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.600
I know this must be difficult for you,
Colonel.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.900
It's difficult for us as well.

09:21.410 --> 09:24.000
In fact, the timing couldn't be worse.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.410
- What do you mean?
- Three weeks ago,

09:26.510 --> 09:29.140
the Ori attempted an attack on Earth.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.510
You survived an Ori attack?

09:31.690 --> 09:32.710
One ship.

09:32.820 --> 09:35.120
We fought them off
with the Ancient Chair.

09:35.220 --> 09:38.160
The ZPM was nearly depleted
in the process.

09:38.260 --> 09:40.750
That's why our Major Carter
was running that experiment.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.700
She was trying to bolster
our power reserves

09:43.800 --> 09:46.130
with captured energy
from other universes.

09:46.230 --> 09:47.960
And, of course,
you only have the one ZPM,

09:48.070 --> 09:51.040
because you've never received
new ones from Atlantis.

09:51.140 --> 09:53.400
Atlantis. You mentioned that before.
What is that?

09:53.510 --> 09:56.500
It's the city of the Ancients,
in the Pegasus Galaxy.

09:56.610 --> 09:59.810
In my reality,
we have an international contingent there.

09:59.910 --> 10:02.640
I don't know about your reality, Colonel,
but in this world,

10:02.750 --> 10:05.780
there isn't much
in the way of international cooperation.

10:06.850 --> 10:12.920
Three years ago, the Goa'uld System Lord
Anubis launched an attack on Earth.

10:13.090 --> 10:16.360
We had no choice
but to reveal the existence

10:16.460 --> 10:19.020
of the Stargate program to the world.

10:19.230 --> 10:20.860
LORNE: People panicked.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.560
There was rioting in the streets.

10:22.670 --> 10:25.430
The President had to declare martial law.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.280
The diplomatic fallout was even worse.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.310
You can imagine
how the world's governments reacted

10:31.410 --> 10:34.310
when they realized
the kind of technology being employed

10:34.420 --> 10:36.850
by the United States military.

10:36.950 --> 10:39.720
We barely got the Chair out of Antarctica
before the Russians moved in.

10:39.820 --> 10:43.920
Now it's at Area 51,
but it isn't going to do us much good

10:44.030 --> 10:48.190
unless we can find a way to power it.
And that's where you come in.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.930
You want me to complete
your Carter's research?

10:52.030 --> 10:54.930
Major Lorne tells me
you've been conducting similar research

10:55.040 --> 10:56.300
in your own universe.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.670
Well, yes, sir, but with all due respect,

10:59.770 --> 11:03.180
we're facing a very real threat
in my universe.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.800
I need to start thinking
about how to get back there.

11:05.910 --> 11:07.470
Let's say we agree to help you get back

11:07.580 --> 11:11.250
and gave you full access
to the resources of this base.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.910
How long would it take?

11:14.720 --> 11:15.850
I don't know.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.290
I don't even have a working theory yet.

11:18.390 --> 11:21.520
Well, are we talking weeks
or maybe even months?

11:22.130 --> 11:23.260
Yeah, it's possible.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.490
That's why I need
to get started right away.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.630
I'm sorry, Colonel, but the fact is
we don't have that kind of time.

11:30.770 --> 11:34.260
Our intelligence indicates that,
having consolidated their position

11:34.380 --> 11:38.840
in this part of the galaxy,
the Ori are assembling a fleet

11:38.950 --> 11:41.920
for a full-scale attack on Earth.

11:42.050 --> 11:44.380
We expect them within five days.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.490
- What's this about, Doctor?
- I'm not entirely sure.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.260
She says she wants
to show us something.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.800
I thought you agreed to help us, Colonel.

12:02.900 --> 12:06.740
Yes, sir, but after talking to Dr. Lee,
I realized it was a mistake for me

12:06.840 --> 12:09.110
to pursue your Carter's research.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.150
May I ask why?

12:13.250 --> 12:15.240
Well, it would take too long
to get me up to speed,

12:15.350 --> 12:17.440
and to be perfectly honest, sir,
I'm not totally convinced

12:17.550 --> 12:18.850
that I could make it work.

12:20.450 --> 12:24.390
- Do you have another suggestion?
- Yes, I do. This.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.490
What the hell?

12:30.600 --> 12:31.900
Doctor?

12:37.710 --> 12:39.040
Colonel, what just happened?

12:39.140 --> 12:40.970
I was taken out of phase, sir.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.300
Invisible and untouchable,

12:42.410 --> 12:44.610
and based on experiments
in my own reality,

12:44.710 --> 12:46.840
100 percent Ori-proof.

12:47.450 --> 12:51.080
No offense, Sam, but how does
hiding one lab full of equipment help us?

12:51.190 --> 12:53.050
Well, the field size can be manipulated.

12:53.150 --> 12:55.780
That's what I was working on
when I was brought here.

12:55.890 --> 12:58.880
Our plan was to hide the entire planet.

13:18.950 --> 13:21.710
Hey. How's it coming?

13:21.880 --> 13:25.410
Oh, okay, I guess.
I was just about to run my first simulation.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.320
You know, it's kind of weird,
seeing you in here.

13:30.420 --> 13:32.860
- It's a little weird being in here.
- Yeah.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.860
It's the same, but it's different, you know?

13:37.930 --> 13:40.830
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

13:43.870 --> 13:47.740
I found these pictures, and in them,

13:50.080 --> 13:52.170
she's wearing a wedding ring.

13:54.150 --> 13:56.980
Yeah, that must have been
before the divorce.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.980
So...

13:59.390 --> 14:01.050
Oh, no, no, no. God, no.

14:01.160 --> 14:05.490
No, it was this dot-com millionaire
smart-ass named McKay.

14:06.890 --> 14:09.860
- Not Rodney McKay?
- Yeah.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.300
You have one, too, huh?
Is he a jerk in your universe?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.490
Some people think so.

14:15.600 --> 14:19.400
Sam always said there was a side to him
that no one else saw.

14:24.310 --> 14:25.680
- General.
- Colonel.

14:25.780 --> 14:27.480
I was just coming to see you.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.910
I know.
I already spoke to Dr. Lee this morning.

14:30.020 --> 14:33.210
Then you know our power calculations
are coming up short.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.810
The battle with the Ori ship
simply taxed the ZPM too much.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.390
I'm sorry, sir. I think I may have traded

14:38.490 --> 14:41.220
one power requirement problem
for another.

14:41.330 --> 14:42.960
Not necessarily.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.500
Sir, who are these people?

14:51.610 --> 14:53.130
Secret Service.

14:53.410 --> 14:55.880
Since when have you had
Secret Service outside your office?

14:55.980 --> 14:58.740
It hasn't been my office for three years.

15:00.150 --> 15:04.020
Colonel, nice to finally get to meet you.

15:05.690 --> 15:07.780
Colonel Carter, President Landry.

15:07.890 --> 15:13.120
- President? Of the United States?
- That's right. Is there a problem?

15:14.160 --> 15:17.460
No, sir, it's just... Never mind.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.760
I understand you're dealing with
a little power shortage.

15:20.870 --> 15:21.990
How much do you need?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.300
Well, about 700 gigawatts.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.460
That's roughly 80 percent
of the power generating capacity

15:26.570 --> 15:28.300
of the continental United States.

15:28.410 --> 15:30.000
So it's doable, then.

15:30.910 --> 15:32.470
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

15:32.580 --> 15:35.810
We've known about the condition of ZPM
for some time, Colonel.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.610
In addition to our Major Carter's research,

15:38.720 --> 15:42.280
as a backup, we've been building
an infrastructure to channel energy

15:42.390 --> 15:45.550
to the Ancient Chair
directly from the U.S. Power grid.

15:45.860 --> 15:48.350
Not enough to give us the upper hand

15:48.460 --> 15:51.300
in a shooting battle
against the whole fleet,

15:51.570 --> 15:56.060
but if your plan works,
there won't be any battles at all.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.360
Charlie, I need a speech,
explaining to the American people

16:00.470 --> 16:02.240
why it's a good thing
they'll be without power

16:02.340 --> 16:04.810
for an undisclosed period of time.

16:04.910 --> 16:06.110
Yes, sir.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.350
Pack your things. You're going to Area 51.

16:22.700 --> 16:26.360
- We're ready, sir.
- All right. Let's do it.

16:31.010 --> 16:34.460
My fellow Americans
and citizens of all nations,

16:34.580 --> 16:37.100
tonight our world faces a grave threat.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.510
The same hostile forces
that recently attacked us

16:39.610 --> 16:41.810
without warning or provocation

16:41.920 --> 16:44.610
are again massing for another assault.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.650
Let me assure you that we intend
to meet this aggression

16:47.760 --> 16:50.250
as we did previously
with unwavering resolve

16:50.360 --> 16:55.230
and fully confident that we will
once again emerge victorious.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.420
<i>In order to achieve this victory,</i>

16:57.530 --> 17:02.090
<i>we will need to divert a significant portion</i>
<i>of our electrical generating capacity...</i>

17:02.200 --> 17:03.400
Okay, try it now.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.060
<i>... to a government facility</i>
<i>in the Nevada desert.</i>

17:05.170 --> 17:08.700
- We're still getting too much variance.
- Damn it. Give me a sec.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.900
<i>LANDRY: Remain calm, stay in your homes,</i>

17:12.010 --> 17:15.410

17:18.150 --> 17:19.450
<i>These are difficult times.</i>

17:19.550 --> 17:20.540
What have we got?

17:20.650 --> 17:23.520
Daedalus just reported that five Ori ships
have breached the safe zone.

17:23.620 --> 17:27.250
<i>LANDRY: But I believe that out of</i>
<i>adversity, greatness is born,</i>

19:16.640 --> 19:18.300
Major, what's our status?

19:19.510 --> 19:22.740
No movement, sir.

to your own universe.

which sits at the back, here.

26:52.960 --> 26:56.450
The keys are labeled in Ancient,
which we're in the process of translating.

26:56.560 --> 27:00.970
Now, these keys, they appear to operate
in the normal way that keys do,

27:01.800 --> 27:03.600
- up and down...
- Doctor!

27:04.500 --> 27:08.700
Have you learned anything substantial
about the operation of this machine?

27:09.310 --> 27:12.370
The operation? Not really. No, sir.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.970
In fact, the only person who truly
understands this technology

27:15.080 --> 27:16.880
is Colonel Carter.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.710
All right. Thank you.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.580
No. Thank you, sir.

27:25.230 --> 27:27.160
What are we going to do?

27:29.130 --> 27:31.100
We're not going to do anything.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.560
Mr. President, we told her if she helped us,
we'd let her go.

27:34.670 --> 27:37.430
I'm sorry, George, but for the moment,
we can't afford to lose her.

27:37.540 --> 27:39.510
She's not going anywhere.

27:41.610 --> 27:42.770
Okay, you need to slow down.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.310
You're telling me my ex-wife is dead,

27:44.410 --> 27:46.070
even though you look exactly like her,

27:46.180 --> 27:48.010
except for the hair,
which is nice, by the way.

27:48.110 --> 27:49.510
On top of that,
you're from another universe,

27:49.620 --> 27:51.740
and you need me to help you get back?

27:51.850 --> 27:54.120
In my reality,
you successfully designed and built

27:54.220 --> 27:58.180
a bridge between parallel universes
with a little help from your sister.

27:58.290 --> 28:01.620
Really? What, so she and I get along
in your universe?

28:01.860 --> 28:03.230
Not exactly.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.330
Anyway, I've been trying my best
to recreate your calculations,

28:06.430 --> 28:08.770
but I keep coming up short.
That's why I'm here.

28:08.870 --> 28:11.770
I have not done
a lot of theoretical physics lately, okay?

28:11.870 --> 28:13.530
I mean, these days I tend to do

28:13.640 --> 28:15.470
a little more of
the buying and selling of companies.

28:15.580 --> 28:19.140
The Rodney McKay I know
wouldn't back down from a challenge.

28:19.250 --> 28:24.480
He is one of the most forthright,
courageous and selfless men

28:24.580 --> 28:26.140
I have ever met.

28:28.190 --> 28:31.320
- Oh, you're making that up, aren't you?
- Most of it, yeah.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.150
Okay, I'll help you.

28:35.730 --> 28:36.700
Good news, Bill.

28:36.800 --> 28:41.230
We've got somebody to help
with the calculations.

28:44.270 --> 28:45.700
Where's my equipment?

28:45.810 --> 28:47.200
Still at Area 51.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.400
It was supposed to be returned
once the Ori fleet was gone.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.700
I need it for the defense of my own world.

28:51.810 --> 28:55.270
I'm sorry, the timing's not good for you
to go back just yet.

28:55.380 --> 28:58.550
We'll revisit your situation
after the plebiscite.

28:59.020 --> 29:00.040
What plebiscite?

29:00.150 --> 29:03.180
Last year, Congress was forced
to cancel the mid-term elections

29:03.290 --> 29:05.450
because of widespread unrest.

29:05.860 --> 29:08.760
It was supposed to be temporary,
but when things didn't improve,

29:08.860 --> 29:11.350
we voted to suspend elections indefinitely.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.330
Now it comes down to
a simple yes-or-no vote

29:13.430 --> 29:14.760
to put the President in office.

29:14.870 --> 29:18.170
You're a member of my team,
the woman who saved the world.

29:19.140 --> 29:23.100
Do you have any idea
what kind of political capital that's worth?

29:23.440 --> 29:25.270
I won't help you subvert democracy.

29:25.380 --> 29:28.370
LANDRY: This world is dangling
by a thread, Colonel, and, unlike you,

29:28.480 --> 29:32.320
the rest of us will never have the luxury
of leaving for someplace better

29:32.420 --> 29:34.110
when things get tough.

29:34.220 --> 29:36.450
This is our home,

29:38.790 --> 29:40.990
and we'll make the best of it.

29:52.570 --> 29:54.870
I don't want to hear it, George.

29:57.180 --> 29:59.300
You could cut her a little slack, sir.

29:59.410 --> 30:01.240
She's completely out of her element.

30:01.350 --> 30:05.720
Trapped here, away from everyone
and everything she knows or cares about.

30:05.820 --> 30:09.190
She also happens to be a symbol of hope
to the entire planet.

30:09.290 --> 30:11.450
Because we made her into one.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.850
Because that's what we needed.

30:14.690 --> 30:17.060
See, I know what you're thinking.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.730
"Damn politicians."

30:18.830 --> 30:21.820
I still can't stand them,
and I'm one of them.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.390
The main one.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.670
You were the right man for the job.
You still are.

30:26.910 --> 30:30.640
I know it wasn't easy for you
taking us down this road.

30:32.180 --> 30:35.340
What's going to be even harder is
getting us back.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.950
Going somewhere?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.730
Maybe to see your friend, Dr. McKay?

30:55.030 --> 30:56.430
You had me followed.

30:56.540 --> 30:59.200
He is a wealthy high-tech industrialist,

30:59.310 --> 31:00.640
and I'm sure if anyone outside of this base

31:00.740 --> 31:02.970
had the resources to help you get back
to your own universe,

31:03.080 --> 31:04.630
he'd be the one.

31:05.410 --> 31:09.610
But he also derives a significant portion
of his income from defense contracts

31:09.720 --> 31:13.850
and some would argue he's a likely target
for an anti-trust investigation.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.650
You'd blackmail him
to keep him from helping me?

31:17.760 --> 31:20.920
Just play your part
and everything will be fine.

31:52.530 --> 31:54.250
MITCHELL: How do you take it?

31:54.360 --> 31:56.190
Just black.

31:59.230 --> 32:00.200
Thank you.

32:00.870 --> 32:04.630
Yeah, I like a little sweetener in mine.

32:07.310 --> 32:09.140
I was an F-302 pilot.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.770
Got shot down over Antarctica.

32:12.410 --> 32:14.510
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.410
Well, a little late in the day for that,
isn't it?

32:16.520 --> 32:20.280
I mean, I already gave my legs
for the freedoms we now enjoy.

32:21.390 --> 32:23.690
It's a hell of a deal, isn't it?

32:27.390 --> 32:29.450
Of course, I recognize you.

32:30.460 --> 32:33.490
Your picture's been
in the papers a lot lately.

32:36.070 --> 32:37.090
Hey.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.840
You want to see something funny?

32:41.570 --> 32:45.370
That's me. That's me when I was you.

32:46.350 --> 32:49.510
Hero of the moment,
poster child for the administration.

32:49.620 --> 32:51.740
- You were walking.
- Yeah, well...

32:52.850 --> 32:55.410
I had a little setback in my therapy.

32:56.620 --> 33:00.420
After Antarctica,
they flew me to Washington,

33:01.590 --> 33:03.650
pinned a medal on my chest.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.060
Next thing I knew,
I was being trotted out to state dinners,

33:06.170 --> 33:08.360
political rallies. I think...

33:08.940 --> 33:11.700
Yeah, I think I even opened a few malls.

33:12.070 --> 33:15.840
Mr. President said,
"It would be good for morale, son.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.740
"Help soften the blow for keeping
the Stargate secret for so long."

33:20.850 --> 33:22.750
What a load of B.S.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.710
So, what happened?

33:26.990 --> 33:28.920
I called him on it,

33:29.020 --> 33:31.010
and they dropped me

33:31.260 --> 33:32.660
like a rock.

33:34.190 --> 33:38.250
No more fancy dinners,
no more expensive doctors.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.800
Anyway, walking is overrated.
I've got everything I need right here.

33:45.810 --> 33:49.610
And I do not have to deal with the curfews

33:49.710 --> 33:52.840
or military checkpoints or being detained

33:52.950 --> 33:54.380
without charge.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.910
Life is sweet.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.590
Look, I'm sorry.
I probably shouldn't have come.

34:05.890 --> 34:09.490
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You wanted to see for yourself, right?

34:10.700 --> 34:13.390
The price for sticking up
for your principles.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.590
Take a good look.

34:36.390 --> 34:38.080
- Yeah.
<i>- CARTER: It's me.</i>

34:38.220 --> 34:39.620
Colonel, where are you?

34:40.660 --> 34:42.990
Please, you know exactly where I am.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.720
Look, I'll do it.

34:44.830 --> 34:48.160
<i>The interviews,</i>
<i>the TVappearances, I'll play ball.</i>

34:49.200 --> 34:50.670
Wise decision.

34:58.680 --> 35:03.840
My guest tonight, Major Samantha Carter,
a 10-year veteran of the Stargate program,

35:03.950 --> 35:06.940
and the woman who almost
single-handedly saved the world

35:07.050 --> 35:08.050
from the recent alien attack.

35:08.050 --> 35:08.990
From the recent alien attack.

35:09.090 --> 35:11.060
- Major, welcome.
- Thank you.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.290
Of course, I will be taking calls
later in the segment, but first,

35:14.390 --> 35:16.360
why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

35:16.460 --> 35:20.590
Well, as you said, I've been with
the Stargate program for the last 10 years.

35:20.700 --> 35:24.000
Most recently, I was appointed
as a special advisor to the President.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.330
Great. In what capacity?

35:26.440 --> 35:28.460
My primary role is to consult
with the President

35:28.570 --> 35:30.540
on matters of planetary defense.

35:30.710 --> 35:33.650
<i>But I also intend to push</i>
<i>for improved foreign relations</i>

35:33.750 --> 35:37.810
<i>and the restoration of civil liberties that</i>
<i>were lost since the President took office.</i>

35:37.920 --> 35:39.350
<i>- Really?</i>
- What the hell is she doing?

35:39.450 --> 35:42.890
<i>JULIA: Does the president welcome this</i>
<i>kind of input from his military advisors?</i>

35:42.990 --> 35:45.820
<i>Well, he wouldn't be much of a president</i>
<i>if he wasn't at least</i>

35:45.930 --> 35:49.020
willing to listen to other opinions.

35:49.700 --> 35:52.160
I mean, while I understand
how we got to where we are today...

35:52.270 --> 35:53.230
Shut it down.

35:53.330 --> 35:55.200
<i>... I think it's time</i>
<i>to reassess the situation.</i>

35:55.300 --> 35:57.570
I don't care if you're live.
Shut it down, now.

35:57.670 --> 35:59.800
The people of this country
need to understand

35:59.910 --> 36:01.900
that they are in control
of their government,

36:02.010 --> 36:03.980
not the other way around.

36:04.740 --> 36:08.870
It's your responsibility as citizens
of this country to demand the freedoms

36:08.980 --> 36:10.810
that have been taken away from you.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.910
Demand accountability for why
they were withheld in the first...

36:14.020 --> 36:18.390
Major, as much I admire
what you're trying to do, they cut us off.

36:22.530 --> 36:23.690
Thanks.

36:25.430 --> 36:27.730
What were you thinking?
You can't say things like that.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.890
Well, somebody's got to say something,
and I'm in a rare position

36:30.000 --> 36:31.230
to make people listen.

36:31.340 --> 36:33.200
They're not going to let you do that,
all right?

36:33.310 --> 36:35.170
I know these people.
They do not mess around.

36:35.270 --> 36:36.540
What are you looking for, anyway?

36:36.640 --> 36:38.840
I want to see how my little tirade's
playing out in the press.

36:38.950 --> 36:39.970
It won't.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.570
What are you talking about?
The show was live.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.670
Millions of people were watching.

36:43.780 --> 36:45.410
It doesn't matter.

36:46.790 --> 36:49.150
I don't understand this.
There's nothing here.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.320
Wait a second.

36:52.430 --> 36:55.160
"Major Samantha Carter had to cut short
an appearance on <i>Inside Access</i>

36:55.260 --> 36:58.750
"with Julia Donovan yesterday
when she suddenly took ill.

37:01.100 --> 37:04.560
"A spokesman said she was suffering
from exhaustion due to her busy schedule,

37:04.670 --> 37:07.160
"and would be canceling
her upcoming appearances."

37:07.270 --> 37:09.370
That's what I'm telling you, Sam.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.100
Look, there is no story. It never happened.

37:12.210 --> 37:14.410
You're wrong. People heard me.

37:15.010 --> 37:16.450
Which people?

37:21.750 --> 37:23.620
Major Carter, you need to come with us.

37:24.620 --> 37:25.680
(GRUNTS)

37:28.360 --> 37:29.850
(GROANS)

37:29.960 --> 37:30.930
(BEEPING)

37:32.030 --> 37:33.660
Get her in the car!

37:46.680 --> 37:50.450
A gag? Charlie, was that really necessary?

37:50.820 --> 37:52.310
It seemed appropriate, sir.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.780
Get it off! And give us the room.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.290
What am I going to do with you, Colonel?

38:07.430 --> 38:08.960
You could let me go.

38:09.070 --> 38:10.660
I still need you.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.830
For what?
My knowledge of phase technology,

38:13.940 --> 38:15.930
or as a prop for public relations?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.870
What if I said both?

38:18.680 --> 38:20.340
I won't keep my mouth shut.

38:20.450 --> 38:23.540
But that's exactly what you do
in your own world.

38:23.650 --> 38:25.640
Stargate's still a secret, right?

38:25.750 --> 38:28.380
You talk about freedom and democracy,

38:28.490 --> 38:30.980
but you're hiding the greatest secret
mankind has ever known

38:31.090 --> 38:32.420
from your own people.

38:32.530 --> 38:34.580
Well, at least on my world,
we don't intend to abandon

38:34.690 --> 38:36.490
the rest of the galaxy to the Ori.

38:36.600 --> 38:40.000
Well, maybe not now,
but what do you think will happen

38:40.530 --> 38:44.400
if you give them a foolproof way to hide,
like you've given us?

38:45.840 --> 38:48.170
And don't be surprised
if the rest of the galaxy

38:48.270 --> 38:50.470
suddenly doesn't seem
that important anymore.

38:51.680 --> 38:55.140
No, see, I know at least one man
who won't feel that way.

38:55.250 --> 38:59.240
He's the leader of Stargate Command.
His name is General Hank Landry.

39:10.460 --> 39:13.130
Ah, Colonel, how nice to see you again.

39:14.230 --> 39:16.100
Yes, well, thank you.

39:19.510 --> 39:21.630
McKay, what are you doing here?

39:21.740 --> 39:25.910
Well, it's the first day on the new job.
Your old job, actually.

39:26.010 --> 39:27.810
Special Advisor to the President.

39:27.910 --> 39:31.580
Bit of a pay cut but, well,
let's just say they were persuasive.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.710
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, me, too.

39:35.190 --> 39:38.590
Well, the first order of business
is to create an inter-universal bridge,

39:38.690 --> 39:42.020
something that I've done
in another reality, apparently.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.560
Are you serious?

39:43.660 --> 39:46.260
Yeah, I'm not sure what you said,
but they're letting you go.

39:46.370 --> 39:50.430
Wow. I guess they must have realized
I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

39:50.540 --> 39:54.030
I remember I said the same thing
the day we got divorced.

39:54.140 --> 39:59.310
The second order of business is
to make this thing work like yours.

39:59.550 --> 40:02.610
Well, I'll leave you my notes.
That should help.

40:02.950 --> 40:05.380
But let's say that you succeed. Then what?

40:05.480 --> 40:06.880
Then we're safe.

40:07.150 --> 40:09.280
You do know that there is
a whole galaxy out there

40:09.390 --> 40:10.880
that's under attack, right?

40:11.220 --> 40:12.820
Millions of people are dying,

40:12.930 --> 40:15.860
millions more being subjugated
to a false religion.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.020
You just never quit, do you?

40:18.130 --> 40:20.760
Deep down, I know that
your president's a good man.

40:20.870 --> 40:22.930
He wants to do the right thing.

40:23.040 --> 40:28.100
Maybe he just needs a persistent voice in
his ear nudging him in the right direction.

40:28.670 --> 40:31.640
And you think
I would be good at that, do you?

40:32.410 --> 40:36.810
The Rodney I know is a master
of subtle persuasion.

40:38.450 --> 40:40.920
Oh, you're lying again, aren't you?

40:41.450 --> 40:42.720
Just think about it.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.730
Dr. Lee?

40:59.110 --> 41:00.070
(EX CLAIMS)

41:00.170 --> 41:01.760
(SCREAMING)

41:02.210 --> 41:03.440
Oh...

41:07.050 --> 41:09.280
- You're back!
- Hi.

41:12.990 --> 41:15.850
So, you didn't get any news on Daniel
while I was gone?

41:15.960 --> 41:17.220
Nothing.

41:17.860 --> 41:20.120
Well, at least we got you back.

41:20.560 --> 41:24.720
I am very glad to be back.
The whole thing was kind of creepy.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.660
- Hey, what was I like in that reality?
- You were in jail.

41:29.770 --> 41:31.130
Not again.

41:32.870 --> 41:34.240
What about the rest of us?

41:34.340 --> 41:37.330
You know, to be honest,
I'd really rather not talk about it.

41:38.580 --> 41:40.070
What about you guys?

41:40.180 --> 41:42.880
What have you been doing
this whole time?

41:45.720 --> 41:47.620
When you did not return for several hours,

41:47.720 --> 41:50.780
we began to suspect
that something might have gone wrong.

41:50.890 --> 41:53.320
Well, we just assumed
that the machine had malfunctioned,

41:53.430 --> 41:55.330
and you were stuck out of phase.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.690
We attempted to communicate with you
using the Sodan cloaking device,

41:58.800 --> 42:00.660
and when that failed...

42:02.470 --> 42:03.530
What?

42:04.240 --> 42:07.030
We took shifts,
trying to keep you company.

42:07.710 --> 42:10.640
- You mean...
- Yeah, we talked to an empty room.

42:10.740 --> 42:13.180
- For two weeks?
- It did stop eventually,

42:13.280 --> 42:17.740
but it did go on for quite some time.

42:17.850 --> 42:19.010
Indeed.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.090
Well, that must have been
some conversation.

42:21.190 --> 42:22.850
What did you say?

42:22.960 --> 42:25.220
You know, I've got a file to read.

42:27.190 --> 42:30.160
I have a sparring session
with Sergeant Siler.

42:31.860 --> 42:34.800
I'm bidding for a time-share on eBay.

42:41.810 --> 42:43.780
- Oh!
- Welcome back, Samantha.

42:43.880 --> 42:46.470
- We really did miss you.
- Thank you.

42:49.420 --> 42:51.180
It's good to be home.
