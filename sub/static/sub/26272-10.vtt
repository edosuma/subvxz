WEBVTT

00:04.743 --> 00:07.007
Last one to the mailbox?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.530
[chuckles]

00:10.836 --> 00:12.621
Whoo!

00:12.664 --> 00:14.101
[laughs]

00:16.233 --> 00:17.060
Morgan, move!

00:20.411 --> 00:22.370
Morgan!

00:22.413 --> 00:23.632
Morgan!

00:27.114 --> 00:29.072
DISPATCHER:
All units be on the lookout

00:29.116 --> 00:30.421
for a white church van

00:30.465 --> 00:32.249
with heavy frontal damage.It's long gone.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.993
Whoa. Forget I said anything.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.824
[siren wailing]

00:41.867 --> 00:44.261
Come to Papa.Unit 1-5-2,

00:44.305 --> 00:46.220
we are northbound on River Road
just past Cannon.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.699
Show us following a vehicle

00:47.743 --> 00:50.180
possibly involved in felony
hit-and-run 45 minutes ago.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.052
White Ford van
with license plate

00:52.095 --> 00:55.664
nine, Eddie, three, seven,
Larry, Peter. Requesting backup.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.067
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:19.296 --> 01:21.733
Lower the window, then place
your hands back on the wheel.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.480
Have you fellas found the woman?
Is she okay?

01:29.524 --> 01:32.004
Sir, I smell alcohol.
Have you been drinking?

01:32.048 --> 01:34.398
ANDY:
Oh, well...

01:37.271 --> 01:40.012
I...Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.275
Keep your hands
in front of you.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.841
But what about the girl?

01:42.885 --> 01:44.104
Step out of the vehicle, now.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.379
[church bell ringing]

01:58.422 --> 02:00.120
[indistinct chatter]

02:03.645 --> 02:06.343
You can set
your watch to it.

02:06.387 --> 02:11.000
9:52, each and every
Sunday morning.

02:11.043 --> 02:13.829
Benjamin Colón,
Attorney at Law emerges

02:13.872 --> 02:16.005
from 9:00 mass looking

02:16.048 --> 02:20.183
renewed and refreshed.[laughs]

02:20.227 --> 02:24.318
Monsignor Espinoza! Wow!
Ah, I see you're slumming it.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.015
Huh, what,
they bump you

02:26.058 --> 02:27.190
back down to
parish priest?
[laughs]

02:27.234 --> 02:29.018
Aren't you supposed
to be working the door

02:29.061 --> 02:30.672
at St. Patrick's
Cathedral?
Hey, hey.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.891
Do not be a wise guy.
Remember who I work for?

02:32.935 --> 02:35.242
Ah, indeed, indeed.

02:35.285 --> 02:36.765
So good to
see you, Father.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.028
What brings you back down here?

02:39.071 --> 02:41.596
You.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.728
Your church needs
your help, Benny.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.687
Mm. Promise you,
Monsignor,

02:45.730 --> 02:48.733
I'm putting every dime
I can spare in that plate.

02:48.777 --> 02:51.083
I mean professionally.

02:51.127 --> 02:54.174
One of our parish priests
out on the end of Long Island,

02:54.217 --> 02:56.045
Father Andy Tincher,

02:56.088 --> 02:58.221
has been charged
in a hit-and-run.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.181
Victim was a young woman
out jogging with her sister.

03:01.224 --> 03:05.272
Yeah, I read about that.
Absolutely tragic.

03:05.315 --> 03:09.580
But, I mean, what can I do?

03:09.624 --> 03:12.888
I have to believe the diocese's
attorneys have it all covered,

03:12.931 --> 03:15.586
and frankly,
from everything I've read,

03:15.630 --> 03:18.459
the best move, maybe,
is to get your guys in there

03:18.502 --> 03:19.416
and have them work out

03:19.460 --> 03:20.896
a plea deal.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.898
It's-it's a bit more
complicated than that.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.771
They hit someone,

03:26.815 --> 03:29.905
drove right to this church,
and then went to confession?

03:29.948 --> 03:32.386
No, no, it was
a church van.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.518
Whoever it was,
was driving a church van,

03:34.562 --> 03:36.999
so they drove straight
back to the church,

03:37.042 --> 03:40.307
Father Andy saw whoever it was,
saw that they were upset,

03:40.350 --> 03:42.265
got them to
confess to him,

03:42.309 --> 03:44.006
then tried to get
them to call 911.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.835
And they wouldn't?Nope.

03:46.878 --> 03:50.012
Worse still, the driver
didn't even know

03:50.055 --> 03:52.536
if the victim was alive or dead.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.800
So Father Andy did
the only thing he could do.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.019
[elevator bell chimes]

03:57.062 --> 04:00.022
So why didn't the
priest call 911?

04:00.065 --> 04:02.503
Well, the Confessional Seal
demands that a priest

04:02.546 --> 04:06.855
never reveal anything disclosed
to him during confession.

04:06.898 --> 04:09.466
Father Andy thought
the victim might be

04:09.510 --> 04:11.642
suffering on the side
of some dark road,

04:11.686 --> 04:14.123
so he got back in
the van to find her

04:14.166 --> 04:15.864
and see if
he could help.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.301
With a blood alcohol
count of .09.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.303
[elevator bell chimes]

04:20.347 --> 04:21.957
Fine, he-he's guilty
of drunk driving,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.699
no one is disputing that, but
the rest of it is exactly why

04:24.742 --> 04:26.701
Monsignor Espinoza
needs our help.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.833
He knows how this is
gonna sound to a jury.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.095
Oh, Benny.
No, Bull,

04:30.139 --> 04:32.489
you're not, you're not
hearing me.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.317
This isn't just about
a hit-and-run.

04:34.361 --> 04:38.278
This is about the Church--
the Roman Catholic Church,

04:38.321 --> 04:41.368
the largest Christian church
in the world--

04:41.411 --> 04:44.240
going to court to protect
the sanctity of confession,

04:44.284 --> 04:45.763
one of the bedrock principles

04:45.807 --> 04:47.678
of the religion,
and they want you and me

04:47.722 --> 04:50.028
to make that case for them.

04:50.072 --> 04:53.162
I feel terribly for
the poor woman's family.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.512
I mean, trying to grieve
with all of this going on?

04:55.556 --> 04:59.908
I think it's just best we
focus on the defense, Father.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.910
BULL: As I'm sure
you know, Father,

05:01.953 --> 05:03.825
as officers of the court,
there are any number

05:03.868 --> 05:07.002
of privileges
that we deal with.

05:07.045 --> 05:10.571
Attorney-client.
Doctor-patient.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.661
But the Confessional Seal
is considerably broader

05:13.704 --> 05:16.403
than what we've
worked with before.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.536
So I just need to get a sense
of how big a blind spot it is

05:19.580 --> 05:20.885
we're dealing
with here.

05:20.929 --> 05:25.368
Of course, of course. Fire away.

05:25.412 --> 05:28.850
So this someone, whose
name you can't share,

05:28.893 --> 05:31.635
hits the woman
with the church van,

05:31.679 --> 05:33.637
comes back here
and confesses.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.683
Yeah.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.686
And after that,
how did they leave?

05:38.729 --> 05:42.254
Excuse me? I don't follow.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.300
BENNY:
I-I think what

05:44.344 --> 05:47.259
Dr. Bull is asking is,
what occurred

05:47.303 --> 05:50.219
after the sacrament
of confession was performed?

05:50.262 --> 05:52.352
Maybe there are some things
that you can tell us,

05:52.395 --> 05:55.137
without violating the Seal,
that can help us

05:55.180 --> 05:58.053
find the person
who actually did this.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.447
I mean, wouldn't that
be the best

06:00.490 --> 06:02.579
outcome for all of us?

06:05.582 --> 06:09.978
I don't think I'm
gonna be much help here.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.720
I mean...

06:12.763 --> 06:14.809
if this had occurred

06:14.852 --> 06:17.986
in the confessional booth,

06:18.029 --> 06:20.684
I couldn't divulge information
about the confessor

06:20.728 --> 06:22.120
as they left the church

06:22.164 --> 06:24.732
because they're on the
other side of the curtain.

06:24.775 --> 06:27.082
It's designed that way
on purpose.

06:27.125 --> 06:30.955
I'm not supposed to see
who's offering the confession.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.174
BULL:
But this confession

06:32.217 --> 06:34.437
didn't take place
in a confessional booth.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.832
It was in the church driveway.

06:37.875 --> 06:42.053
I don't think where you confess
makes a difference to God.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.797
Have you had any contact
with the driver

06:46.841 --> 06:49.365
since he or she
made the confession?

06:49.409 --> 06:53.282
It feels like these questions
are really all just an effort

06:53.325 --> 06:56.981
to get to the identity
of the confessor,

06:57.025 --> 06:58.418
which you have to understand,

06:58.461 --> 07:01.421
I'm not at liberty to disclose.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.423
I mean, not without
violating the spirit

07:03.466 --> 07:05.425
of the Confessional Seal.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.036
Father Andy, I don't know
what to tell you.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.690
You were caught

07:09.733 --> 07:12.040
in the van with
the victim's blood on it.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.476
You were drunk.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.783
You're being charged
with vehicular manslaughter,

07:15.826 --> 07:17.872
leaving the scene
of an accident,

07:17.915 --> 07:19.090
and driving under the influence.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.353
The prosecution
has a very strong case.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.920
Now, I'm not asking you
to break your vows

07:22.964 --> 07:25.706
or the Confessional Seal,

07:25.749 --> 07:29.318
but I can't defend you if you
won't help defend yourself.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.581
Huh?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.627
You just-- you got to give me
something to work with.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.109
I'll understand
if you can't help me.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.765
Will you really?

07:41.809 --> 07:44.202
You're willing to spend
15 or 20 years in prison

07:44.246 --> 07:45.943
for something you didn't do?

07:45.987 --> 07:49.294
Do you believe in God, Dr. Bull?

07:49.338 --> 07:52.863
Well, when I'm on a plane

07:52.907 --> 07:54.517
and there's a lot of turbulence,

07:54.561 --> 07:57.215
I sometimes wish I'd gone
to church a bit more,

07:57.259 --> 07:59.479
but day in and day out?

07:59.522 --> 08:02.394
Confession is a...
is a gift of grace

08:02.438 --> 08:05.615
and a way back to God
for those who are lost.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.313
It saves lives and souls.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.187
I understand.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.190
This is not a choice
for me, gentlemen.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.105
I mean, confession's
not an obstacle to overcome

08:17.148 --> 08:19.368
so you can catch
whoever did this.

08:19.411 --> 08:22.589
It's-it's an essential step
on the path to redemption

08:22.632 --> 08:25.853
for that tortured soul
who killed that woman.

08:25.896 --> 08:29.117
So, no.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.250
I can't give you
something to work with.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.643
I'm doing the only thing

08:33.687 --> 08:35.645
I know how.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.126
I'm putting my trust in God.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.576
Thing that makes
turbulence so frightening

08:53.620 --> 08:56.013
is you never
see it coming.

08:58.625 --> 09:02.672
Mr. Colón and I would be pleased
to represent you, Father.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.068
♪

09:15.729 --> 09:19.384
Ah. Don't think I've ever
tried a case in Suffolk County.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.865
Well, that's the judge,
uh, there's the jury,

09:21.909 --> 09:25.695
and we sit here.
Mm.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.263
All right. So what's the plan?

09:28.306 --> 09:31.745
Win.

09:31.788 --> 09:35.400
Well, we need to make sure
whoever ends up in that jury box

09:35.444 --> 09:37.794
understand the only reason
Father Andy was in that van

09:37.838 --> 09:41.276
was because he made a solemn vow
he could not break.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.843
Well, that doesn't
sound so tough.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.280
People understand vows.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.282
Marriage vows...

09:47.325 --> 09:49.240
Well, you would
be surprised.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.155
For most people, the idea
of going to prison

09:51.199 --> 09:54.942
just to keep a promise,
that's gonna be a tough sell.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.553
And it's not like we can put
Father Andy on the stand.

09:57.597 --> 10:01.339
Why not? I can't imagine
a more trustworthy witness.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.428
Well, the problem is he's
not gonna be able to answer

10:03.472 --> 10:05.213
the questions the other
side is gonna ask,

10:05.256 --> 10:06.780
and the jury's gonna
hold that against him.

10:06.823 --> 10:10.522
They're gonna feel like he's
hiding something, which he is.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.089
Even if it's for
the right reasons?

10:12.133 --> 10:14.614
Trust me, it's human nature.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.529
If someone's got a secret,
we want to know what it is.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.749
What about these jurors?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.403
I'm assuming we're
looking for Catholics,

10:21.446 --> 10:23.971
or at the very least,
regular churchgoers?

10:24.014 --> 10:26.756
Not necessarily.
Believe it or not,

10:26.800 --> 10:29.150
church attendance is not always
such a great indicator

10:29.193 --> 10:31.892
of a person's spiritual life.

10:31.935 --> 10:34.764
I see that you attend
Hope Baptist Church?

10:34.808 --> 10:37.332
17 years. Every Sunday.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.334
MARISSA:
That may be what she's doing

10:39.377 --> 10:41.249
on Sundays,
but the rest of the week,

10:41.292 --> 10:43.338
she's having an
"emotional affair" via text

10:43.381 --> 10:45.688
with a man from Albuquerque
she's never met,

10:45.732 --> 10:49.300
and who her husband
is totally unaware of.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.741
What we want are
moral objectivists.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.134
Jurors with a strong
internal code

10:57.178 --> 10:58.919
that doesn't change
with societal whims

10:58.962 --> 11:00.703
and bureaucratic rules.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.532
They're duty bound,
they know the value of a secret,

11:03.575 --> 11:07.188
and more importantly, expect
everyone to keep their word.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.711
Good morning, sir.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.061
I see, from your
jury questionnaire

11:11.105 --> 11:12.280
that you have
a 14-year-old daughter.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.716
I do.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.805
By any chance,
does she keep a diary?

11:15.849 --> 11:18.808
She calls it a journal.Ah.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.810
You ever think
about looking at it?

11:20.854 --> 11:22.246
Reading it?

11:22.290 --> 11:24.596
No. That's not...

11:24.640 --> 11:25.989
What if

11:26.033 --> 11:27.512
you were worried about her?

11:27.556 --> 11:29.514
Something going on behaviorally

11:29.558 --> 11:31.821
and she won't
talk to you about?

11:31.865 --> 11:34.302
No. I couldn't.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.738
It's hers.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.348
BENNY:
Your Honor,

11:37.392 --> 11:39.481
this juror is acceptable
to the defense.

11:39.524 --> 11:44.051
And this is my domain.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.530
Is this where someone would come

11:45.574 --> 11:47.750
if they wanted
to check out the van?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.883
[sighs]
If we still had one,

11:49.926 --> 11:53.147
and you wanted to use it,
this is where you would come.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.409
And the drivers?

11:54.452 --> 11:57.499
Well, there's Father Andy,
of course,

11:57.542 --> 12:00.415
and me, and eight others
are authorized to take it.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.853
I'll get you the names.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.638
How do you keep track of who
has the van at any given time?

12:06.682 --> 12:11.774
Oh, well, every trip is entered
on the calendar.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.995
We don't want our choir stranded

12:15.038 --> 12:18.302
because someone decided to get
groceries for the kitchen.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.347
And the key?

12:19.390 --> 12:21.784
We keep it in here.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.874
Only authorized drivers
are given the combination.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.572
And we have this log,

12:27.616 --> 12:29.183
which is where they're supposed
to sign out

12:29.226 --> 12:30.619
whenever they take the key.

12:30.662 --> 12:33.448
Unfortunately,
no one signed out

12:33.491 --> 12:34.710
the night of the accident.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.583
Oh, my gosh!

12:38.627 --> 12:39.976
There he is.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.978
Jacob. Harvard?

12:42.022 --> 12:44.154
Oh, that is amazing.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.895
I have been praying
you would hear good news.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.114
Thanks.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.159
ERIC:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.465
In the meantime,
we're all starving here.

12:50.508 --> 12:51.727
Pizza should be
arriving any minute.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.121
I'll get you your petty cash.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.301
Oh. Give me a second.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.838
I understand you also had
an opportunity to examine

13:15.882 --> 13:18.928
the vehicle involved,
the St. Bernadine's church van?

13:18.972 --> 13:21.235
Yes, I did.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.627
And this wasn't
your first encounter

13:22.671 --> 13:24.978
with this particular vehicle,
was it?

13:25.021 --> 13:26.936
No.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.765
MADDEN: Can you
tell us about it?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.855
I stopped to assist Father Andy
two years ago.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.465
He was in the same van

13:34.509 --> 13:35.858
on the side of the road
with a flat tire.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.469
Was there anything unusual
about this interaction?

13:41.516 --> 13:44.388
He had clearly been drinking.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.912
[people gasping]

13:45.955 --> 13:47.130
BENNY:
Your Honor?

13:47.174 --> 13:48.088
May we approach?

13:51.134 --> 13:52.570
Your Honor,

13:52.614 --> 13:54.877
this is impermissible
character evidence.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.532
We all know that
the prosecution isn't permitted

13:57.575 --> 13:59.969
to prove conduct
through a prior bad act.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.710
MADDEN: Defense counsel asserted
in his opening statement

14:01.753 --> 14:04.147
that the defendant
never would have driven drunk

14:04.191 --> 14:05.322
but for the alleged confession.

14:05.366 --> 14:06.758
He opened the door to this.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.543
We're permitted--
in fact, we're obligated--

14:08.586 --> 14:10.240
to refute that defense.

14:10.284 --> 14:13.026
I'm gonna allow it.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.730
And did you arrest the defendant
at that time? Cite him?

14:21.773 --> 14:24.646
No.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.735
He was a priest,
and I felt sorry for him,

14:26.778 --> 14:28.955
so I drove him
back to the church.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.913
No further questions,
Your Honor.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.959
So how bad is it?

14:33.002 --> 14:35.483
How bad would you like it?

14:35.526 --> 14:37.093
We've lost them all.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.486
Not a single green in the bunch.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.409
ANDY: I never
put it together.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.629
Not even when the
officer took the stand.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.937
I-It's not like he, he asked me
if I'd been drinking, or...

14:54.981 --> 14:56.330
It's not like he gave me

14:56.373 --> 14:57.984
a breathalyzer test.

14:58.027 --> 15:01.074
I-I was trying to change a tire
and he came over to help.

15:01.117 --> 15:03.990
And, like, a
minute in, he said,

15:04.033 --> 15:07.819
"How about I just give you
a ride back to the church?"

15:07.863 --> 15:09.865
I'm guessing he could
smell it on you.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.737
It's not like that.
I-I'd come from a wedding.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.697
No. Sorry. It is like that.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.918
You're on trial for murder,
for killing a young woman

15:18.961 --> 15:20.093
while driving
under the influence.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.964
I wasn't drunk.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.401
I think I'd had two glasses
of wine. Maybe three...

15:24.445 --> 15:26.534
BENNY: Father Andy,
we really need to know,

15:26.577 --> 15:29.580
are there gonna be
any other surprises?

15:29.624 --> 15:31.713
No. I'm certain of it. No.

15:31.756 --> 15:34.063
Unfortunately, Officer Avery's
testimony made it sound

15:34.107 --> 15:36.196
like this was
a pattern of behavior.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.939
I'm gonna need you
to take the stand.

15:39.982 --> 15:43.029
Uh... what would be the point?

15:43.072 --> 15:45.335
I mean, what would
you want me to say?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.339
The truth.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.080
I need you to talk about
the night of the flat tire.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.474
There's no confession involved.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.519
You don't need to talk
about anybody but yourself.

15:55.563 --> 15:59.436
It'll give the jurors a chance
to see who you really are.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.699
That you're forthcoming.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.440
That you're not afraid
to take the witness stand,

16:03.484 --> 16:05.529
and most importantly,

16:05.573 --> 16:09.098
that you're not someone
who normally drinks and drives.

16:12.667 --> 16:16.018
And what happens if they start
asking about the hit-and-run?

16:16.062 --> 16:18.760
We'll invoke
the cleric-penitent privilege.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.980
What choice do we have?

16:21.023 --> 16:22.633
CHUNK:
So,

16:22.677 --> 16:24.026
at this
particular reception,

16:24.070 --> 16:27.029
how many drinks
would you say you had?

16:27.073 --> 16:28.900
Two.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.946
Maybe three-- glasses of wine.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.992
Two? Maybe three?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.776
You don't remember?

16:34.819 --> 16:37.431
I mean, w-was it two or three?

16:37.474 --> 16:39.868
Well, truthfully,
I can't be sure.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.609
It was over two years ago.

16:41.652 --> 16:45.308
Well, you testified that you-you
really don't drink that often.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.703
So I would think that you would
remember if it was two or three.

16:48.746 --> 16:52.141
Maybe I'll just answer "three"
next time.

16:52.185 --> 16:55.231
Ask me something else.

16:55.275 --> 16:59.192
So it's your testimony, Father,

16:59.235 --> 17:02.456
that the only two times

17:02.499 --> 17:04.893
that you've been stopped
by law enforcement

17:04.936 --> 17:08.288
happened to also be the only
two times that you've drank

17:08.331 --> 17:11.508
and then got behind
the wheel of a car?

17:11.552 --> 17:13.902
I-I... Now, I know
how that sounds.

17:13.945 --> 17:18.167
I've-I've heard all the stories
and all the jokes about

17:18.211 --> 17:20.517
drunken priests.

17:23.259 --> 17:26.958
Go to a wedding,
everybody's dressed up,

17:27.002 --> 17:29.439
everybody's there
to have a good time.

17:29.483 --> 17:34.053
And there I am, with my collar
and my vows and my Bible,

17:34.096 --> 17:37.491
and I'm-I'm a-a silent reminder

17:37.534 --> 17:41.147
to everyone, uh,
not to have too much fun.

17:41.190 --> 17:44.411
Not to have too good a time.

17:44.454 --> 17:48.458
And what I've discovered
over the years is that

17:48.502 --> 17:51.244
if I'm holding
a glass of something--

17:51.287 --> 17:54.116
i-if I'm holding
a glass of anything--

17:54.160 --> 17:56.075
people relax a little bit.

17:56.118 --> 17:59.426
They-they forget a little bit.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.646
Okay. That's better.

18:02.690 --> 18:06.476
That's warmer,
it's a touch more human.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.089
But frankly, the jury doesn't
want to hear excuses,

18:10.132 --> 18:13.179
or that you drink to make them
feel more comfortable.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.746
A woman is dead.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.097
And you know what happened
and you won't tell anyone

18:18.140 --> 18:20.403
and you're asking for a pass.

18:20.447 --> 18:25.016
And so what I want in return--
what, what they want in return--

18:25.060 --> 18:26.627
is to feel that they know you.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.411
To feel that they can trust you.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.284
Okay. How do I do that?

18:31.327 --> 18:33.895
Take ownership of your mistakes.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.767
"I drank too much. Period.

18:36.811 --> 18:40.336
"I should not have
driven myself home. Period.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.512
"I vowed to never
do it again.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.384
"Period.
The night of the hit-and-run

18:44.427 --> 18:46.995
"is a completely
different thing. Period.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.606
"There was a woman on the side
of the road who needed help

18:49.650 --> 18:54.176
and I was determined
to help her. Period."

18:54.220 --> 18:56.178
[exhales]

18:56.222 --> 18:59.094
Is this the way
you always do it,

18:59.138 --> 19:01.270
prepare people for court?

19:01.314 --> 19:03.881
I mean, you
raise your voice?

19:03.925 --> 19:07.015
You taunt them?

19:07.058 --> 19:09.017
Or is this just for me?

19:09.060 --> 19:11.628
No.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.630
I have a complicated
relationship

19:13.674 --> 19:15.632
with organized religion,

19:15.676 --> 19:18.635
and I think I projected that
onto you.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.115
Hmm.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.291
Well, you're in good company.

19:22.335 --> 19:26.469
A lot of people have problems
with organized religion.

19:26.513 --> 19:29.255
No, I don't have a problem
with organized religion.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.562
It has a problem with me.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.434
Catholic?

19:34.477 --> 19:36.044
Baptist.

19:36.087 --> 19:39.656
Hmm.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.964
I went every Sunday.

19:43.007 --> 19:46.663
I started singing in the choir
in eighth grade.

19:52.408 --> 19:56.064
Those were tough years for me.

19:56.107 --> 19:59.328
I carried around a lot of shame.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.250
I wasn't sure who I was,

20:08.294 --> 20:11.297
and when I started getting
surer, I wasn't sure I liked it.

20:14.082 --> 20:16.650
I can't count the number of
nights that I'd go to sleep

20:16.693 --> 20:20.131
praying to God
that he would fix me.

20:22.308 --> 20:25.485
It was pretty clear that...

20:25.528 --> 20:28.357
I was no longer welcome.

20:31.491 --> 20:35.495
And I got to admit...
[scoffs]

20:35.538 --> 20:38.062
I miss it.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.200
But now I guess you could say

20:45.244 --> 20:49.117
that my relationship with God
is my own.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.512
Hmm.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.689
Well, good for you.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.560
I'm glad you didn't
give up on God

20:57.604 --> 21:01.390
because your church
gave up on you.

21:04.219 --> 21:08.441
Now, ask me another question.

21:08.484 --> 21:09.920
DANNY:
I'm telling you,

21:09.964 --> 21:12.358
anyone could have taken
that van key, authorized or not.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.794
TAYLOR:
Well here's a crazy idea.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.187
What if we forget about the who.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.233
Maybe just concentrate
on the where.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.930
I'm not following.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.629
Well, I was thinking,
if I could just figure out

21:22.672 --> 21:25.022
where the van had been
and where the van was heading,

21:25.066 --> 21:26.807
it might help us
identify the driver.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.200
You can do that?Already did.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.680
The van has an onboard
navigation system,

21:30.724 --> 21:32.073
which I was able
to access remotely.

21:32.116 --> 21:35.642
The cool thing is,
any time the vehicle is on,

21:35.685 --> 21:37.861
the system notes
and records its location

21:37.905 --> 21:41.038
whether you're asking it
for directions or not.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.214
We know the location
of the hit-and-run.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.086
So what I've been doing
is looking for other trips

21:45.129 --> 21:47.697
that used that road,
passed by that location.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.438
And...?

21:49.482 --> 21:52.093
And I found two others.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.356
Both stopped
at the same address.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.185
Do they correlate with any
other entries in the log pages?

21:57.228 --> 21:59.448
TAYLOR:
They do not.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.320
If you give me that address,
I'll go over and check it out,
see what I can find out.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.669
Just e-mailed it to you.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.323
[phone chimes]

22:04.366 --> 22:08.109
So Officer Avery didn't actually
administer a breathalyzer test?

22:08.152 --> 22:09.371
No. He didn't.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.200
Or conduct any kind
of field sobriety testing?

22:12.243 --> 22:15.943
No. Uh, but I-I still think
Officer Avery

22:15.986 --> 22:18.728
did the right thing,
driving me home.

22:18.772 --> 22:21.731
I'd had a few glasses of wine.

22:21.775 --> 22:26.736
And, uh, I-I really
shouldn't have driven.

22:26.780 --> 22:30.349
It was a mistake, and one
that I don't take lightly.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.961
I don't make a habit
of drinking and driving.

22:34.004 --> 22:38.226
Although, I-I do understand
how it must look.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.620
And yet, you did drink and drive

22:40.663 --> 22:42.752
on the night
of Ms. Newhouse's death.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.059
Yes, I did.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.409
And I plead guilty to that.

22:47.453 --> 22:51.413
Father, can you please
explain to the court

22:51.457 --> 22:54.329
how you ended up behind
the wheel of the van that night?

22:57.332 --> 22:59.160
I was in my office.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.814
Uh, typically,

23:00.857 --> 23:03.599
Thursdays are
the only night that, uh,

23:03.643 --> 23:06.950
I have any time to myself.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.691
I have a Scotch.

23:08.735 --> 23:10.911
I started to read.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.653
A window was open

23:13.696 --> 23:17.308
and I heard the parish van
drive up behind the rectory.

23:17.352 --> 23:20.747
I didn't remember there being
anything scheduled.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.793
To be honest, I didn't even know
that someone had taken it.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.230
So I walked down
to see who it was.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.756
And what did you find?

23:29.799 --> 23:32.802
The driver-- this person--

23:32.846 --> 23:34.456
was very upset.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.024
Panicked.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.287
And they confessed to me

23:39.330 --> 23:42.159
that they had struck a woman
with the van.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.901
And what did you do?

23:44.945 --> 23:48.470
I gave absolution.

23:48.514 --> 23:53.083
And then I pleaded
with the driver to call 911.

23:53.127 --> 23:54.781
And did they?

23:54.824 --> 23:58.915
The person-- the-the driver--

23:58.959 --> 24:00.830
they were pretty distraught.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.615
They were quite hysterical.

24:02.658 --> 24:05.661
And I realized that this person

24:05.705 --> 24:07.924
was not capable
of making that call.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.665
So did you make it?

24:09.709 --> 24:12.320
Did you call 911

24:12.363 --> 24:13.582
when the driver refused to?

24:13.626 --> 24:15.279
No.

24:15.323 --> 24:18.805
No. The Confessional Seal
can't be broken.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.502
So I couldn't.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.504
And all I kept thinking about

24:22.548 --> 24:25.072
was this woman
that I had just heard about.

24:25.115 --> 24:28.510
And I-I had a...
only a vague description

24:28.554 --> 24:30.512
of where all of this happened.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.862
[sighs]

24:32.906 --> 24:34.429
And the only thing
I could think to do

24:34.473 --> 24:37.693
was to get in the van
and go look for her myself.

24:37.737 --> 24:41.131
Father Andy...

24:41.175 --> 24:42.959
were you driving the van

24:43.003 --> 24:44.961
when it struck and killed
Morgan Newhouse?

24:47.268 --> 24:50.401
When you called me up here,

24:50.445 --> 24:54.318
you had me place my hand
on the Holy Bible.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.583
And I swore
that I would tell the truth.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.149
So here it is.

25:01.761 --> 25:05.808
I was not in that van when
it struck poor Ms. Newhouse.

25:05.852 --> 25:09.595
And I certainly was not driving
that van when it struck her.

25:09.638 --> 25:14.077
I did get in it
and go look for her.

25:14.121 --> 25:17.124
And I had a drink
shortly before.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.300
[Andy sighs]

25:21.432 --> 25:24.523
I know how much it must ache

25:24.566 --> 25:27.003
not to know
what happened.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.309
I know
how it pains me

25:28.352 --> 25:30.920
not to be able to tell you.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.532
But God has a plan.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.752
I believe that
with all my heart.

25:36.796 --> 25:39.189
Thank you, Father.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.365
No further questions,
Your Honor.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.631
[quietly]:
Drumroll, please...

25:45.674 --> 25:47.589
They like him.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.504
They sense
he's telling the truth.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.724
We've won back three jurors.

25:51.767 --> 25:52.855
Hmm.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.338
Father Andy...

25:57.381 --> 25:59.209
let me make sure
I understood you.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.255
On the night in question,

26:01.298 --> 26:03.083
you went down to the van.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.433
This alleged driver did not
seek you out. Is that correct?

26:05.476 --> 26:06.956
Yes, that's correct.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.349
MADDEN:
Okay, then.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.481
Now that we've
cleared that up,

26:10.525 --> 26:12.266
I have
just one question for you.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.443
If you weren't driving the van
that killed Morgan Newhouse...

26:15.486 --> 26:16.836
who was?Objection!

26:16.879 --> 26:19.621
Your Honor,
as we've previously established,

26:19.665 --> 26:21.275
this information is protected

26:21.318 --> 26:23.712
by the cleric-penitent
privilege.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.540
I disagree, Your Honor.

26:25.584 --> 26:29.065
Would the attorneys please
approach the bench?

26:33.113 --> 26:34.810
Your Honor, based on
Father Andrew's testimony

26:34.854 --> 26:38.248
just moments ago, the privilege
doesn't apply in this case.

26:38.292 --> 26:39.641
To meet the legal threshold,

26:39.685 --> 26:41.687
the penitent must be
intentionally seeking

26:41.730 --> 26:43.558
spiritual guidance
and absolution.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.994
Your client just admitted

26:45.038 --> 26:46.605
that it was he
who sought out the driver,

26:46.648 --> 26:47.606
not the other way around.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.216
Well, that's ridiculous.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.784
It's obvious what the intent
of the law is, Your Honor.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.310
Mr. Colón,
I understand your argument,

26:56.353 --> 26:58.225
but since the language
of the statute

26:58.268 --> 27:00.575
doesn't support your position,

27:00.619 --> 27:03.491
I'm going to have to side
with Mr. Madden.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.754
I'm sorry, but no privilege
will be granted

27:05.798 --> 27:07.451
with regard to
your client's testimony.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.588
[quietly]:
I sense some turbulence coming.

27:15.851 --> 27:20.900
The witness is instructed
to answer the question.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.729
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.165
I cannot answer.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.862
Father Andy,

27:26.906 --> 27:28.385
the court ruled

27:28.429 --> 27:30.866
that the clergy-penitent
privilege doesn't apply.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.042
For the second time,

27:33.086 --> 27:35.654
you are instructed
to answer the question.

27:35.697 --> 27:40.006
Again-- I apologize
to the court--

27:40.049 --> 27:42.399
but the Confessional Seal
forbids it.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.924
My vow to the Church forbids it.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.013
My oath to God forbids it.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.579
This is your last chance.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.886
If you don't
answer the question,

27:50.930 --> 27:53.106
I will be forced to hold you
in contempt of court.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.588
I'm sorry.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.591
I answer to God and the Vatican.

28:00.635 --> 28:03.812
Unfortunately for you,
this is not a court of God.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.118
This is a court of law.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.902
I'm holding you
in contempt of court.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.948
[gavel bangs]

28:08.991 --> 28:10.993
And because you won't allow
yourself to be cross-examined,

28:11.037 --> 28:12.691
your previous
testimony

28:12.734 --> 28:14.170
is stricken from the record.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.085
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

28:16.129 --> 28:18.044
I instruct you to disregard
the testimony of the defendant

28:18.087 --> 28:19.262
in its entirety.

28:19.306 --> 28:22.048
You will not consider
anything he said

28:22.091 --> 28:23.963
in your deliberations.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.181
Take this man into custody.

28:40.457 --> 28:41.807
I sought out this firm's help

28:41.850 --> 28:44.461
for one reason
and one reason only.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.942
The Church is committed
to protecting

28:46.986 --> 28:50.163
the sanctity
of confession.

28:50.206 --> 28:54.994
We cannot and we will not
allow a secular court

28:55.037 --> 29:00.216
to render 20 centuries of
Catholic sacrament irrelevant.

29:00.260 --> 29:03.002
[sighs]
Monsignor...

29:03.045 --> 29:05.744
But as this trial has commenced,

29:05.787 --> 29:08.007
it has degenerated

29:08.050 --> 29:10.836
from a reasoned conversation

29:10.879 --> 29:14.056
about a treasured
Catholic sacrament

29:14.100 --> 29:16.189
into something else entirely.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.800
Into a spectacle.

29:18.844 --> 29:21.455
The news is filled

29:21.498 --> 29:23.805
with revelations
of drunk driving.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.415
A Catholic priest

29:25.459 --> 29:29.115
paraded before the press
in handcuffs.

29:29.158 --> 29:33.075
A growing
public belief

29:33.119 --> 29:36.949
that the Church
is harboring a priest

29:36.992 --> 29:40.822
who is wielding confession
as a shield

29:40.866 --> 29:45.871
behind which to hide
his own criminal behavior.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.873
Well, w-we know how it looks,
but...

29:47.916 --> 29:49.875
the trial isn't over yet.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.659
It is.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.226
For us.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.796
I am sorry,
gentlemen.

29:57.839 --> 30:00.363
I know how hard you've worked.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.757
You're firing us.
No.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.847
I am directing you
to negotiate a plea.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.283
The quicker the better.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.111
The sooner this case

30:09.155 --> 30:11.418
is no longer a part of
the public conversation,

30:11.461 --> 30:13.115
the better it will be
for everyone.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.117
Except possibly Father Andy.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.640
The man's innocent.

30:16.684 --> 30:17.554
Really?

30:17.598 --> 30:18.860
You still believe that,

30:18.904 --> 30:20.862
after everything we heard
in that courtroom?

30:20.906 --> 30:23.038
And you wonder why you don't
see me in church on Sundays.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.474
It's guys like this.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.041
They're with you
through thin and thin.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.739
Don't you dare judge me.

30:32.091 --> 30:33.353
I have

30:33.396 --> 30:37.444
296 parishes

30:37.487 --> 30:39.925
to worry about.

30:39.968 --> 30:42.536
Hey, Benny.
Help your friend out.

30:42.579 --> 30:44.407
I think he's looking
for the high side of the boat.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.366
It's out that door,
down the elevator

30:46.409 --> 30:48.020
and right out onto the street.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.760
And just to be clear...

30:49.804 --> 30:51.632
whether you pay our bill or not,

30:51.675 --> 30:54.026
Benny and I are going to be
representing Father Andy

30:54.069 --> 30:56.115
in court,
defending his innocence.

30:56.158 --> 30:59.858
Because-- and this might be
a novel concept,

30:59.901 --> 31:02.991
but when we make a promise,

31:03.035 --> 31:05.951
when we make a pledge...

31:05.994 --> 31:07.387
we keep it.

31:19.529 --> 31:20.617
Oh, relax.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.010
You're going to be fine.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.403
It's me.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.317
I'm going to hell.

31:26.406 --> 31:28.016
But then again, I always was.

31:28.060 --> 31:28.887
[doorbell rings]

31:31.890 --> 31:33.630
Yes?
DANNY: Hi. Sorry
to bother you.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.284
My name's Danny James.

31:35.328 --> 31:38.070
I'm an investigator
working on behalf of Father Andy

31:38.113 --> 31:40.115
from St. Bernadine Church.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.161
I'm trying to track down some
information on a hit-and-run

31:42.204 --> 31:44.076
that occurred a few weeks back
on River Road.

31:44.119 --> 31:46.339
Oh, of course.
I read about that, yeah.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.254
Have you seen this vehicle?

31:48.297 --> 31:49.951
We have reason to
believe it was actually

31:49.995 --> 31:51.300
parked in front of your house

31:51.344 --> 31:52.823
a little over
a month ago.

31:52.867 --> 31:53.824
Yeah.

31:53.868 --> 31:55.348
Uh, Jacob drove it here.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.784
I think that's his church's.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.003
They let him drive it sometimes.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.482
Jacob?

31:59.526 --> 32:00.396
Jacob Larson.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.529
Oh, um...

32:02.572 --> 32:06.881
We met at church camp
last summer.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.623
He doesn't go to my school
or anything,

32:09.666 --> 32:11.451
but we started
hanging out after that.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.279
Do you still see him?

32:13.322 --> 32:14.889
No.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.586
Not for a few weeks, actually.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.068
It wasn't serious or anything.

32:20.112 --> 32:23.942
Or... maybe I thought it was
more serious than he did.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.379
So, wait. You don't
see him anymore?

32:26.422 --> 32:28.990
He got into Harvard.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.992
And I guess
it kinda changed him.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.994
How so?

32:33.038 --> 32:35.866
Well, the day he got the letter,
he called me.

32:35.910 --> 32:39.566
He was super excited,
because he got in. He got in!

32:39.609 --> 32:44.310
And, um, he wanted to come over
that night and celebrate.

32:44.353 --> 32:47.617
And then he just didn't show up.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.010
And you haven't
talked to him since?

32:49.054 --> 32:51.012
I... called him.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.144
I texted him.

32:52.187 --> 32:55.190
I even DM'd him on Instagram.

32:55.234 --> 32:57.149
And... nothing.

32:59.673 --> 33:00.804
Whatever.

33:00.848 --> 33:01.892
I'm over it.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.111
DANNY:
...and as it happens,

33:03.155 --> 33:04.895
the quickest route
from St. Bernadine's

33:04.939 --> 33:07.333
to Jessica's house
is River Road.

33:07.376 --> 33:10.336
So Jacob would have driven right
by the scene of the accident.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.689
Taylor, when did those Harvard
early admission notices go out?

33:15.732 --> 33:19.432
E-mail notifications went
out Thursday the 29th.

33:19.475 --> 33:20.389
Same day
as the hit-and-run.

33:20.433 --> 33:21.695
BULL:
So...

33:21.738 --> 33:24.828
Jacob gets into Harvard.
He's thrilled.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.222
He's on his way over
to see his girl,

33:27.266 --> 33:28.963
he hits Morgan.
He panics.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.486
Turns around,
heads back to the church,

33:30.530 --> 33:33.185
and afterwards,
he is scared and guilt-ridden,

33:33.228 --> 33:35.709
and cuts off all contact
with Jessica.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.624
So... we cracked the case,
right?

33:40.279 --> 33:42.237
Still waiting for
our "attagirls." [chuckles]

33:42.281 --> 33:44.326
Well, I wouldn't say
you cracked it.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.067
More like dinged
it a little.

33:46.111 --> 33:49.070
It's great, but not enough
to save Father Andy.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.681
But we know who did it.BENNY: No.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.205
No, actually, we don't.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.250
It's just a theory.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.513
We can't actually prove anything

33:57.557 --> 34:01.822
other than this Jacob
got into Harvard.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.694
What else do we know
about this Jacob?

34:04.738 --> 34:06.870
Lives with his mom,
straight-A student.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.437
Spends a lot of time
at church

34:08.481 --> 34:10.352
and volunteering,
and has never been in trouble.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.093
So he's a good kid.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.226
Not a cold-blooded killer.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.793
Just someone who
made a horrible mistake.

34:16.837 --> 34:20.406
Got to be... scared.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.190
Riddled with guilt.

34:22.234 --> 34:23.452
Dying to talk.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.280
So what are you thinking?

34:25.324 --> 34:28.066
I'm thinking this kid confessed
once before;

34:28.109 --> 34:30.416
maybe we can get him
to do it again.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.169
Can I help you?

34:44.212 --> 34:46.562
Funny, I was about to
ask you the same thing.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.651
Uh, I think you might be
in the wrong place.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.175
I'm setting up
for a youth group.

34:50.218 --> 34:51.785
There's a bulletin board outside
in the hall

34:51.828 --> 34:53.134
that lists everything else
that's going on.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.397
Nope. I'm in the right place.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.443
You're Jacob, right?

34:59.619 --> 35:00.924
My name's Dr. Jason Bull.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.578
I'm part of Father Andy's
legal team.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.624
[exhales]

35:04.667 --> 35:05.929
I don't know if you've heard,

35:05.973 --> 35:07.235
but things aren't going
very well.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.324
How do you mean?

35:09.368 --> 35:11.631
He's a priest.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.808
Everyone knows he would never...Everybody knows what
they're told. Hmm?

35:14.851 --> 35:17.898
Father Andy was driving the van.

35:17.941 --> 35:21.293
He'd had a drink,
and a woman died.

35:21.336 --> 35:25.732
The only real question is:
will he go to prison

35:25.775 --> 35:28.430
for 15 years or
will it be 20?

35:28.474 --> 35:32.782
Will he die in prison or will he
live long enough to get out

35:32.826 --> 35:35.568
and have a few years of freedom?

35:38.223 --> 35:40.921
My guess is
it was a horrible accident.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.097
What's your guess?

35:47.101 --> 35:50.235
It was an e-mail from Harvard's
Office of Admissions.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.020
It said that I got in.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.457
BENNY:
Harvard.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.372
That's quite an accomplishment.

35:57.416 --> 36:00.723
You must have been very excited,
very proud.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.422
I was.

36:03.465 --> 36:06.207
And I was really grateful.
[sniffles]

36:06.251 --> 36:08.905
I had got a lot of help.

36:08.949 --> 36:11.691
Encouragement from... my mom.

36:11.734 --> 36:14.172
People at the church.

36:14.215 --> 36:18.480
I'm the first person
in my family to go to college.

36:18.524 --> 36:21.701
Or, uh, would have been.

36:21.744 --> 36:24.660
I'm guessing
you wanted to celebrate.

36:24.704 --> 36:27.881
I was dating this girl, Jessica.

36:30.144 --> 36:33.930
I thought maybe
we could do something.

36:33.974 --> 36:37.804
Nothing big, you know.
Just... hang out.

36:37.847 --> 36:42.504
I didn't have any money
for an Uber or a taxi,

36:42.548 --> 36:44.550
or anything.

36:44.593 --> 36:47.205
And I-- St. Bernadine's
is just down the street.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.032
And I knew the van
would be there.

36:49.076 --> 36:52.645
And that wasn't the first time
you borrowed the van, was it?

36:52.688 --> 36:55.169
JACOB:
No, I had...

36:55.213 --> 36:58.041
taken it twice before
to see Jessica.

36:58.085 --> 37:01.044
And what happened
after you borrowed the van?

37:05.310 --> 37:08.356
I was driving...

37:08.400 --> 37:10.793
and I got a text.

37:10.837 --> 37:14.319
It wasn't even... really for me.

37:14.362 --> 37:17.235
It was just an ad
for some stupid game.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.848
And there was a thud.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.417
At first I thought
it was a deer.

37:28.463 --> 37:31.031
But then I looked up.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.774
BENNY:
And what did you do?

37:38.647 --> 37:41.998
I didn't do anything.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.218
I knew I should,
I should get out.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.438
Help her, but...

37:46.481 --> 37:48.570
I didn't.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.920
So you just sat there.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.314
[sniffles]
I turned around...

37:53.358 --> 37:56.839
[sniffles] and I started driving
back to the church.

37:56.883 --> 38:01.061
I just... [sniffles]

38:01.104 --> 38:04.630
I wanted to get out of that van.

38:04.673 --> 38:07.894
I wanted to make it
not have happened.

38:07.937 --> 38:11.724
I'd just gotten the best
news of my life.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.856
BENNY: So you got back
to the church...

38:13.900 --> 38:17.730
And I'm standing
in the parking lot.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.993
I'm looking at the dent.

38:20.036 --> 38:23.213
The blood.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.737
[sniffles]

38:24.780 --> 38:27.174
And there's Father Andy.

38:27.217 --> 38:31.483
It was like
God had already told him.

38:34.094 --> 38:37.924
He said God would
forgive me for anything,

38:37.967 --> 38:41.057
but I needed to confess.

38:41.101 --> 38:43.625
So I did.

38:43.669 --> 38:47.325
And then, he tried to get me
to call the police.

38:47.368 --> 38:52.155
But all I could think of
was my mom and my friends

38:52.199 --> 38:55.333
and my future.

38:55.376 --> 38:59.772
I'm... so, so sorry.

38:59.815 --> 39:03.558
I-I never meant to hurt
your sister, your daughter.

39:03.602 --> 39:06.735
Anyone. Not my mom.

39:06.779 --> 39:09.434
Not Father Andy.

39:09.477 --> 39:13.046
BENNY: No further questions,
Your Honor.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.440
Mr. Madden, any questions?

39:19.008 --> 39:21.881
Your Honor, in light of
this testimony,

39:21.924 --> 39:25.624
we'd like to dismiss the charges
against Father Andrew Tincher.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.800
And we'd also like to
seek an arrest warrant

39:27.843 --> 39:30.977
for Jacob Larson in the felony
hit-and-run of Morgan Newhouse.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.501
JUDGE:
So ordered.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.329
[gavel bangs]

39:49.256 --> 39:51.301
Just so you know, we're
gonna do everything we can

39:51.345 --> 39:54.043
to get Jacob the
best deal possible.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.134
You'd think
after all these years,

39:58.178 --> 40:02.400
I'd have a better grasp
on how God works.

40:02.443 --> 40:05.664
Still a mystery.

40:05.707 --> 40:07.753
I was watching Jacob
on the stand,

40:07.796 --> 40:12.148
and I...
I just kept wondering

40:12.192 --> 40:15.325
maybe I'm just supposed to
plead guilty.

40:15.369 --> 40:19.460
You don't really
believe that.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.463
But you were willing to
do it, weren't you?

40:22.507 --> 40:25.031
Give up one or two
decades of your life.

40:25.074 --> 40:27.860
Walk all alone into a prison
for someone else.

40:27.903 --> 40:31.429
I... I wouldn't have been alone.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.391
I envy you.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.611
You envy me?

40:39.654 --> 40:43.179
Had myself a little heart
attack about six months ago

40:43.223 --> 40:44.398
on the courthouse steps.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.617
Not this courthouse...

40:45.660 --> 40:47.793
I never would have known.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.490
[sighs]

40:49.534 --> 40:53.146
Funny thing is,
I was lying there,

40:53.189 --> 40:56.236
ridiculous pain,
middle of the day,

40:56.279 --> 41:00.588
people... walking by.

41:00.632 --> 41:03.983
Mm-hmm.

41:04.026 --> 41:07.247
And I looked up and I
didn't see any angels,

41:07.290 --> 41:08.944
I didn't see...

41:08.988 --> 41:13.906
some glorious white light.

41:13.949 --> 41:16.865
I just saw a
patch of blue sky.

41:19.215 --> 41:24.177
I was dying in the
middle of New York City...

41:24.220 --> 41:26.658
and I was all alone.

41:26.701 --> 41:29.225
Ah.

41:29.269 --> 41:32.620
Yeah, I envy you.

41:32.664 --> 41:35.884
You're never
alone, are you?

41:35.928 --> 41:39.148
No, I'm not.

41:41.673 --> 41:44.153
You know, Dr. Bull,

41:44.197 --> 41:47.156
you could have that, too.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.246
There's always a place
at the church for you.

41:50.290 --> 41:53.989
You know, I'd be pleased to
help you find the way.

41:54.033 --> 41:57.906
Well, that's a very
tempting offer, Father.

41:57.950 --> 42:01.954
The thing is, as
I'm sure you know,

42:01.997 --> 42:03.912
God moves people
in mysterious ways.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.305
Uh-huh.

42:05.348 --> 42:07.960
The way he moves me,
I just cannot

42:08.003 --> 42:10.571
drag my butt out of bed
on a Sunday morning.

42:10.615 --> 42:12.355
But like you said...

42:12.399 --> 42:16.229
who are we to question
how God works?

42:16.272 --> 42:19.667
You know you're going
to hell, right?

42:19.711 --> 42:22.844
Yup. Already
booked my suite.

42:22.888 --> 42:23.932
