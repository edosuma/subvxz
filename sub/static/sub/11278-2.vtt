        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:10.600 --> 00:12.000
Oh, Robin, I just get           

00:12.100 --> 00:14.600
so lonely and confused          
when I'm not with you.          

00:14.700 --> 00:16.300
          Well, now, I've missed
        you, too, sweetheart.   

00:16.400 --> 00:18.600
Did you like the little         
surprise I sent?                

00:18.700 --> 00:20.800
                 Surprise?      
The Polaroids.                  

00:20.900 --> 00:22.600
    What? I-I don't remember.   

00:22.700 --> 00:24.900
The pictures of me              
wearing that teddy              

00:25.000 --> 00:26.200
you like.                       

00:26.300 --> 00:28.600
The picture of me <i>holding</i>       

00:28.600 --> 00:30.000
that teddy you like.            

00:30.100 --> 00:31.300
      Now, Rebecca, don't tease.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.800
    Not so early in my sentence.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.000
Oh, Robin, you really mean      
you didn't get the pictures?    

00:35.000 --> 00:36.600
    I think I would remember.   

00:36.600 --> 00:38.700
Well, I know I mailed them.     

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
I went to pick up               
my final paycheck at Cheers     

00:40.900 --> 00:42.600
and then I mailed them.         

00:42.600 --> 00:45.300
Oh,  well, they'll get here.    
                        Yeah.   

00:45.400 --> 00:47.800
    Okay, for this one          
    without the teddy,          

00:47.900 --> 00:50.400
    we will start               
    the bidding...              

00:50.500 --> 00:52.200

00:52.300 --> 00:53.400
     Don't crowd.               

00:53.600 --> 00:55.200

02:08.900 --> 02:10.800
      I guess I don't have      
 to show you where anything is  

02:10.900 --> 02:12.100
        behind the bar,         
      right, Mr. Peterson.      

02:12.100 --> 02:14.300
              No, no, no, we got
             the, uh, beer taps,

02:14.300 --> 02:15.600
                    you got your
                uh, cherries,   

02:15.700 --> 02:19.800
                 olives, pretzel
                     bag... Hey!

02:19.800 --> 02:22.800
             You guys got a cash
             register back here.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
          Oh, my God!           

02:27.100 --> 02:28.900
  I'm in one of Norm's dreams.  

02:30.600 --> 02:31.500
No, no, no.                     

02:31.600 --> 02:33.700
I'm just doing my hour          
behind the bar to qualify       

02:33.800 --> 02:36.000
for the employees'              
basketball game.                

02:36.200 --> 02:38.600
Although my dreams are          
very similar to this.           

02:38.600 --> 02:40.000
Except for, uh, in my dreams    

02:40.000 --> 02:41.500
the, uh, kegs                   
are a lot taller                

02:41.600 --> 02:42.900
                      and, uh...

02:43.000 --> 02:44.400
well, I can fly.                

02:44.400 --> 02:46.400
                        Oh.     

02:46.400 --> 02:48.100
         I've got a good feeling
                this year, guys.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.500
             I think we're gonna
                 beat those guys

02:49.500 --> 02:51.200
from Gary's Old Towne Tavern.   

02:51.300 --> 02:53.600
            Yeah!               
Al right!                       
        Oh, this again.         

02:53.600 --> 02:56.200
  I mean, every year they beat  
      you, humiliate you,       

02:56.200 --> 02:57.800
          outsmart you          
      and take your money.      

02:57.900 --> 02:59.400
                 I mean, where's
             the virtue in that?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.200
                Tradition.      

03:02.600 --> 03:04.700
     Well, forgive me if I don't
          share your enthusiasm.

03:04.700 --> 03:08.100
          I've just been feeling
          a bit edgy these days.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.300
          Why's that, Dr. Crane?

03:09.400 --> 03:11.600
        Well, Lilith, in her own

03:11.700 --> 03:14.000
    dear, compulsive, little way

03:14.100 --> 03:15.500
                made the mistake
                    of asking me

03:15.600 --> 03:17.500
                    if I thought
                 she looked fat.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.900
     And what did you say?      

03:19.000 --> 03:21.100
                Well, I told her
        she looked just fine.   

03:21.200 --> 03:23.400
      Ooh, rookie mistake.      
Yeah.                           

03:23.400 --> 03:27.100
            So, uh, what kind of
     punishment are you getting?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.400
        Oh, I'm not getting any.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.200
     Oh, you got off easy.      

03:30.300 --> 03:33.800
        No. I'm not getting any.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.500
  No, you're getting off easy.  

03:40.400 --> 03:42.000
Ho, Woody, think fast!          

03:42.000 --> 03:43.700
            (laughs)            

03:46.800 --> 03:49.100
    (patrons cheering)          

03:53.400 --> 03:54.900
        Way to pass her         
        off there, Sam.         

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
         Wait till you guys hear
        what I did this weekend.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.600
            You know, ever since
              I bought this bar,

03:58.700 --> 04:00.900
      I've been trying to remind
 people it's still a sports bar,

04:00.900 --> 04:03.100
    so I've been going around   
         renewing some of my old

04:03.200 --> 04:04.300
                sports contacts.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.100
And for those of you            
who've never seen Sam           

04:06.200 --> 04:07.800
renewing his old                
sports contacts,                

04:07.900 --> 04:09.100
it goes something like this.    

04:09.200 --> 04:10.400
            "Oh, come on!       

04:10.400 --> 04:11.700
     "You've got to remember me!

04:11.700 --> 04:12.900
            You've got to!"     

04:14.000 --> 04:15.900
This shows what you know.       

04:16.000 --> 04:17.100
      I happened to spend       
          the weekend           

04:17.200 --> 04:19.300
    going head-to-head          
    with Kevin McHale.          

04:19.399 --> 04:20.500
Whoo.                           
                  Whoa.         
                            Hey.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.700
                    That's my   
                favorite Celtic.
        Yeah?                   

04:22.800 --> 04:24.700
You know, uh,                   
basketball was invented         

04:24.800 --> 04:27.400
by the ancient Celtics.         

04:27.500 --> 04:31.700
You know, interestingly enough, 
so was the parquet floor.       

04:32.900 --> 04:34.400
             You've been working
            without your hat,   

04:34.500 --> 04:36.400
             haven't you, Cliff?

04:36.400 --> 04:38.000
                    So, Sammy...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
shot hoops                      
with Kevin McHale, huh?         

04:40.000 --> 04:42.500
      Actually, no, I, uh,      
    I played golf with him.     

04:42.600 --> 04:44.100
    Beat him, too, you know.    

04:44.200 --> 04:45.300
         Hurt him bad.          
                      All right!

04:45.300 --> 04:46.900
WOODY:                          
All right!                      
        Yeah, you know,         

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
 big a star as he is, you, uh,  
shank a tee shot into his shin, 

04:50.000 --> 04:52.800
         and he'll cry          
    just like anybody else.     

04:52.800 --> 04:54.600
      Hey, Sammy, I've got      
         a great idea.          
Yeah, what?                     

04:54.600 --> 04:57.400
 Ask Kevin to play on our team. 
No.                             

04:57.400 --> 04:59.500
Then we'll really cream Gary's. 
                        Yeah!   

04:59.600 --> 05:00.700
  No, no, that'd be cheating.   

05:00.800 --> 05:02.500
    But that'd be               
    good cheating.              

05:02.600 --> 05:03.600
         You know, at what point

05:03.700 --> 05:06.500
            does cheating become
                a moral dilemma?

05:06.600 --> 05:08.900
        I mean, can the severity

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
            of snitching that   
              last piece of cake

05:11.100 --> 05:13.700
             be compared to, oh,

05:13.700 --> 05:16.400
     cheating on one's wife with
      the beautiful, young woman

05:16.500 --> 05:18.700
            that works in the   
        office next to yours?   

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
          I should footnote this

05:22.100 --> 05:24.700
              by adding that I'm
                not getting any.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.800
      Hello, sports fans!       

05:28.900 --> 05:31.800
        (patrons booing)        

05:31.900 --> 05:33.600
 What are you doing here, Gary? 

05:33.700 --> 05:37.100
I just came by to introduce you 
  to some of my new employees.  

05:37.200 --> 05:39.600
      Come on down, boys.       

05:39.700 --> 05:42.600
                        FRAISER:
                 Oh, hey, hey...
CARLA: Oh, hey!                 

05:42.600 --> 05:43.900
                    Come on.    
         Yeah, what...?         

05:43.900 --> 05:45.800
         Those guys are ringers.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.300
                    They're just
                a couple of kids

05:47.300 --> 05:48.700
            working their way   
                through college.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.600
GARY:                           
Oh, by the way,                 

05:50.600 --> 05:52.500
            I just wanted to let
        you know that we're open

05:52.500 --> 05:54.400
            to any wagers.      

05:54.400 --> 05:55.900
        Oh, oh, that's right.   

05:55.900 --> 05:57.700
                You guys are too
                 chicken to bet.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.900
 Hey, we're not chicken to bet. 

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
 We bet you stomp all over us.  

06:01.100 --> 06:03.500
    If I were you Sam,          
I'd get a piece of this action. 

06:05.200 --> 06:07.700
      He means do we want to bet
    on ourselves here, Woody.   

06:07.700 --> 06:09.600
(laughs):                       
Are you kidding?                

06:09.700 --> 06:11.700
With those two skyscrapers?     

06:11.700 --> 06:13.800
Man, I thought                  
I was the bumpkin here.         

06:15.100 --> 06:16.500
            Have it your way.   

06:16.600 --> 06:19.300
            Oh, oh, Sam, give me
          the ball for a second.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.200
            Watch this.         

06:24.700 --> 06:25.700
                  (laughs)      

06:25.700 --> 06:27.000
             See you at the gym.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.400
    Boy, that Gary's a rat.     

06:31.500 --> 06:32.600
Yeah, can you                   

06:32.600 --> 06:33.700
         believe that?          
      Bringing in a couple      

06:33.800 --> 06:35.400
    of professional ringers     
        like that?              

06:35.500 --> 06:37.100
              No, I meant       
        stealing our ball.      

06:39.100 --> 06:40.400
        Oh, man, that's         
    my favorite ball!           

06:40.400 --> 06:42.200
          I hate that!          
    Give me the phone.          

06:42.300 --> 06:43.700
          I'm calling,          
  I'm calling Kevin right now.  

06:43.800 --> 06:45.000
All right!                      
                        Yeah!   

06:45.000 --> 06:46.500
            He'll be able to get
          that ball back for us.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.600
             He's way big.      

06:48.600 --> 06:49.800
             Yeah, all right.   

06:49.900 --> 06:51.000
If he wants to play that way,   

06:51.100 --> 06:52.300
                  I'm just gonna
                get Kevin McHale

06:52.300 --> 06:53.700
                    to come down
            and play with us.   

06:53.800 --> 06:55.100
                There you go!   
          Yeah.                 

06:55.200 --> 06:57.300
    If he doesn't want to do it,
    then I'll get Larry Bird.   

06:57.300 --> 06:58.900
No, no, no, no,                 
not Bird.                       

06:59.000 --> 06:59.800
      If he's in, I'm out.      

06:59.900 --> 07:01.100
CLIFF:                          
Woody.                          

07:01.100 --> 07:03.000
Woody, Woody, you telling me    
you know Larry Bird?            

07:03.000 --> 07:05.300
I don't have to know him.       
He's from French Lick, Indiana. 

07:05.400 --> 07:07.300
He's a doofus.                  

07:08.400 --> 07:09.900
            So what?            

07:09.900 --> 07:12.200
      You're from Indiana       
      and you're a doofus.      

07:12.400 --> 07:14.500
    Yeah, but I would rather    
    be a doofus from Hanover    

07:14.600 --> 07:16.700
than a doofus from French Lick, 
  'cause everyone from Hanover  

07:16.700 --> 07:20.000
knows that French Lick is       
 the doofus capitol of Indiana. 

07:21.700 --> 07:24.700
    Of course everyone from     
French Lick thinks it's Hanover.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.400
          It's a fuel           
    of a raging controversy.    

07:27.500 --> 07:28.400
                  Yo, Kevin.    

07:28.500 --> 07:30.600
            Hi. Sam Malone here.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.900
Hey, listen, you remember how   
      I told you about that game

07:32.900 --> 07:35.500
      my bar is playing against,
    uh, Gary's Old Towne Tavern?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.300
            Yeah, how'd you like
              to get in on that?

07:38.400 --> 07:41.200
         No, I... I know, I know
      you've got a busy schedule

07:41.300 --> 07:42.200
                      and all...
Sammy...                        

07:42.300 --> 07:43.800
tell him it's for charity.      

07:43.900 --> 07:45.800
                  No, no listen,
     I understand, I understand.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.300
              I'm not gonna bust
                your chops here.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.500
                     You know...
             these needy orphans

07:50.600 --> 07:53.100
    have been through it all.   

07:53.200 --> 07:56.500
          They're used to people
              letting them down.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.800
    Oh, I'm sorry, didn't I tell
         you it was for charity?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.400
              Oh, I'm sorry man.
                  Yeah, charity.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.100
Well, no, don't worry about it. 

08:03.200 --> 08:04.800
         I can get one          
    of the Lakers to do it.     

08:04.800 --> 08:07.100
I mean, they're good guys.      

08:07.200 --> 08:09.800
    I mean, they'll give up     
     an hour of their time      

08:09.900 --> 08:12.300
to change some poor kids' lives.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.900
Sam, leave the man alone.       

08:16.000 --> 08:17.800
 You know, if somebody doesn't  
     want to do something,      

08:17.900 --> 08:20.600
no amount of manipulation,      
    cajoling, pleading          

08:20.600 --> 08:22.700
     or lying can get them      
     to change their mind.      

08:22.800 --> 08:23.700
     That's fantastic, man!     

08:23.800 --> 08:25.100
        All right.              
    I'll see you down here.     

08:27.000 --> 08:29.500
                  Could you call
          Lilith for me? I'll...

08:38.200 --> 08:40.799
         Boy, look at the curves
                  on that glass.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.500
                  Oh, feel that.

08:48.100 --> 08:52.000
            Boy, he's really not
             getting any, is he?

08:52.100 --> 08:54.000
     Pathetic.                  

08:54.100 --> 08:55.900
Woody, uh, pour me              
another beer, will you?         

08:57.200 --> 08:59.800
     Put it in one of those     
        girlie glasses.         

09:02.200 --> 09:03.800
                 Hey, everybody!

09:03.900 --> 09:05.900
             I want you to meet,
    uh, your bartender, here,   

09:06.000 --> 09:07.900
            Mr. Kevin McHale!   

09:08.000 --> 09:09.700
(cheers, whistles and applause) 

09:12.500 --> 09:13.800
Kevin...                        

09:13.900 --> 09:15.300
        watch your head,        
        watch your head.        

09:15.300 --> 09:16.600
    Low bridge.                 
                  Low bridge.   

09:18.000 --> 09:19.200
Welcome aboard, Kevin.          

09:19.300 --> 09:20.500
I hope your years at Cheers     

09:20.600 --> 09:22.000
are as happy                    
as mine were.                   

09:22.100 --> 09:24.800
Sam, I'll get my stuff together 
    and get out of your way.    

09:24.800 --> 09:25.900
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.600
            Come back here, man.
         He's not replacing you.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.200
         He just filling in here
              for a little while

09:29.300 --> 09:31.500
    so he can qualify to play   
        the game against Gary's.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.100
              Oh!               

09:33.200 --> 09:35.500
            Oh, in that case,   
                here's an apron.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.100
All right.                      

09:37.100 --> 09:39.800
         Well, so what's it like
        working with <i>Larry Bird?</i>

09:41.200 --> 09:42.400
Hey, Larry's great.             

09:42.400 --> 09:43.500
Larry's funny as can be.        

09:43.600 --> 09:44.900
Boy, he's got some              
great jokes.                    

09:44.900 --> 09:46.800
And most of his jokes           
are about these doofuses        

09:46.900 --> 09:48.100
from Hanover, Indiana.          

09:53.300 --> 09:54.400
Did you ever hear this one?     

09:54.500 --> 09:55.600
How many guys from Hanover      

09:55.600 --> 09:57.000
does it take                    
to change a lightbulb?          

09:58.400 --> 09:59.900
It doesn't even matter          
'cause they gotta drive         

10:00.000 --> 10:02.800
all the way over to French Lick 
just to get the lightbulb.      

10:09.900 --> 10:11.600
                      I heard it
             a little different.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.000
                        NORM:   
                     Hey, Kevin!

10:16.000 --> 10:18.200
            Want to slam-dunk me
        a beer over here, buddy?

10:18.300 --> 10:19.100
     Nah, I can't do that.      

10:19.200 --> 10:20.800
That's against NBA policy.      

10:20.900 --> 10:22.000
     Oh, right, yeah, yeah,     
        they don't, uh,         

10:22.100 --> 10:24.100
      like their athletes       
  promoting drugs or alcohol,   

10:24.200 --> 10:27.200
    so tonight, uh, Kevin's     
just going to be serving water. 

10:27.300 --> 10:28.900
                        To whom?

10:31.900 --> 10:33.500
Do you believe this, huh?       
     I'm about to play ball     

10:33.600 --> 10:35.100
with Kevin McHale tonight?      

10:35.100 --> 10:37.000
You know, I didn't realize      
we were playing at night.       

10:37.100 --> 10:38.900
    Are you sure the orphans    
     can stay up that late?     

10:39.000 --> 10:40.400
          The orphans?          
    Yeah, the orphans.          

10:40.500 --> 10:42.100
              The orphans, yeah,
            you know, well...   

10:42.200 --> 10:43.600
Oh, oh, right, right.           
        See, uh, one of the, uh,

10:43.700 --> 10:45.300
         one of the great things
     about orphans is, they have

10:45.400 --> 10:48.200
              no parents to tell
         them when to go to bed.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.000
 Listen, Kevin, about the, uh,  

10:53.000 --> 10:54.600
            these orphans, uh...

10:54.700 --> 10:55.900
    well, they're not coming.   

10:56.000 --> 10:57.600
             Uh, seems there was
            some kind of mix-up.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.200
              You know, they had
             tickets to the, uh,

10:59.300 --> 11:00.600
             circus or something
                      like that.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.300
         You know these orphans,
they're always getting freebies.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.500
        Oh.                     

11:04.500 --> 11:06.500
    I don't know, Sam,          
there's no circus in town.      

11:06.600 --> 11:08.500
      Well, uh, may-- oh, right.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.500
                 It was the, uh,
            monster truck rally.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.800
                    That was it.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.700
No, no, no-no,                  
not tonight.                    

11:16.200 --> 11:19.400
    All right, guys, where do   
      you think the orphans are?

11:21.100 --> 11:21.900
     Come on, Sam.              

11:21.900 --> 11:23.200
There are no orphans, are there?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.600
            W.. in the world?   

11:24.700 --> 11:26.600
              God, Kevin, I wish
            that were true, man!

11:26.600 --> 11:29.100
Oh, Sam, this is all a big scam.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.300
There are no orphans.           
I'm out of here.                

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
              Aww, Kevin, Kevin,
                  wait a minute.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.900
              Let me talk to you
              here for a second.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.300
                    Listen, man,
            wait, wait, wait.   

11:35.400 --> 11:37.500
    We've got a $5,000          
         bet with Gary.         

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
                    $5,000, huh?

11:39.600 --> 11:42.300
Yeah. I-I can't afford          
to lose that kind of money.     

11:44.500 --> 11:46.000
                 Well, I do have
                a friend of mine

11:46.100 --> 11:48.400
 who's on the board of directors
at the Sunny Grove Orphanage.   

11:48.400 --> 11:50.600
    I'll bet he knows           
 where the orphans are tonight. 

11:52.800 --> 11:55.500
        Anyway, I-I know that   
    they're desperate for money.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.800
      And let's say the winnings

11:56.900 --> 11:58.300
            for our game were   
            to go to the kids...

11:58.400 --> 11:59.600
Oh, hell, yes!                  

11:59.600 --> 12:02.400
We don't mind                   
if those tykes get their cut.   

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
                    No, no, Sam,
                  not their cut.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.500
        They get every penny.   

12:05.500 --> 12:08.700
Every... Uh, guys,              
what do you say here?           

12:08.800 --> 12:11.100
I mean, we're in it             
to beat Gary, right?            

12:11.100 --> 12:13.400
I mean, that's what             
it's all about, isn't it?       

12:13.400 --> 12:15.500
     I want my money back.      

12:15.500 --> 12:17.100
SAM:                            
Listen, listen.                 

12:17.300 --> 12:18.900
        If Kevin plays,         
then we're definitely gonna win,

12:18.900 --> 12:22.000
so it'll be Gary's $5,000       
  that we give to the orphans.  

12:22.000 --> 12:23.300
          But if he...          
      if he doesn't play,       

12:23.400 --> 12:24.800
     then we're definitely      
          gonna lose,           

12:24.900 --> 12:27.400
  and it'll be our five grand   
that we're giving to Gary.      

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
All right, I'm behind you.      

12:28.500 --> 12:29.300
                        I agree.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.000
                I want my       
                money back.     

12:32.100 --> 12:34.700
          Okay, then,           
    we're all agreed.           

12:37.700 --> 12:39.100
                  Here they are,
                 God bless them.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
                      They're at
                  the boat show.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.000
        MEN (chanting):         
    Gary! Gary! Gary!           
          Gary! Gary!           

12:49.100 --> 12:50.700
    Gary! Gary! Gary!           

12:50.800 --> 12:52.700
Wait, wait, wait, wait,         
wait, wait, wait.               

12:52.700 --> 12:54.600
Gary's not here.                

12:54.600 --> 12:56.500
                      Find Gary!
                      Find Gary!

12:56.500 --> 12:57.800
                      Find Gary!
Wait, wait, wait,               
wait, man.                      

12:57.800 --> 12:59.600
We're just early, that's all.   
We'll have to wait.             

12:59.700 --> 13:00.800
                  Wait for Gary!
                  Wait for Gary!

13:00.900 --> 13:02.900
    Wait... What, am I          
    the only one here?          

13:03.000 --> 13:04.500
            Okay, guys, let's   
                 huddle up here.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.600
All right,                      
all right.                      

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
          Have a seat.          
     Have a seat, fellows.      

13:07.400 --> 13:08.800
All right.                      
                    Settle down.
                    Settle down.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.100
            Come on.            
                      Okay, now,

13:11.200 --> 13:13.100
    the way I see it,           
  anyone gets within ten feet   

13:13.100 --> 13:14.900
          of the ball,          
     they pass it to Kevin.     

13:14.900 --> 13:16.100
                        Yeah.   
        Sounds good             
        to me.                  

13:16.200 --> 13:18.200
What if                         
he's not open?                  
                    (laughs)    

13:18.300 --> 13:20.100
          Yeah, yeah.           
                            MEN:
            Old Towne Tavern!   

13:20.100 --> 13:23.900
            Old Towne Tavern!   
            Old Towne Tavern!   

13:23.900 --> 13:25.700
     Well, the cheerleaders     
        are here.               

13:25.800 --> 13:27.400
        Well, Sam,              

13:27.500 --> 13:30.400
              you really want to
                 go through with
                 this formality,

13:30.500 --> 13:31.800
        or you just want to call
            the whole thing off?

13:31.900 --> 13:33.800
Oh, let's go through            
the formalities, Gar.           

13:33.900 --> 13:36.300
    Say, have you met           
    our, uh, new bartender?     

13:36.400 --> 13:38.300
        Right over here.        

13:38.400 --> 13:41.200
                     This is our
                    ringer, Gar.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.500
You're getting a little bald    
on top, fellow.                 

13:43.600 --> 13:44.800
                    Let's go.   

13:44.800 --> 13:47.100
                        (shouts)

13:48.100 --> 13:49.200
    Wait-wait-wait...           

13:49.300 --> 13:50.400
SAM:                            
All right!                      

13:50.500 --> 13:52.200
     All right, way to go,      
        way to go!              

13:53.900 --> 13:55.400
                          Kevin.
                          Kevin.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.000
SAM:                            
Good stuff, man.                
Good stuff.                     

14:03.800 --> 14:06.500
SAM:                            
Keep going.                     
Get it!                         

14:06.600 --> 14:08.000
Nice one, Kevin!                

14:09.100 --> 14:10.400
        Go, Kevin.              

14:10.400 --> 14:12.800
                        NORM:   
                     Yes, Kevin!

14:17.500 --> 14:18.700
                             Go!
                             Go!

14:18.800 --> 14:20.100
                            Yes!

14:21.500 --> 14:22.900
                    Hey, hey!   

14:25.100 --> 14:27.300
Yeah, right, yeah!              

14:28.300 --> 14:29.300
                      Take that.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.600
                In your face!   
                In your face!   

14:31.700 --> 14:33.200
Come on, Woody!                 
Come on, Woody!                 

14:33.300 --> 14:34.500
    Come on!                    
                          Woody!

14:34.600 --> 14:36.200
    Kevin can't do              
    everything here.            

14:36.300 --> 14:37.500
How's it going?                 

14:37.500 --> 14:38.700
         Kevin's doing          
        everything here.        

14:38.700 --> 14:40.000
    Yeah?                       

14:40.000 --> 14:41.400
                      Well, say,
            what's the score?   

14:41.400 --> 14:42.700
         Uh, 70... two.         

14:42.800 --> 14:43.900
To what?                        

14:44.000 --> 14:45.400
          We have 70,           
         they have two.         

14:45.500 --> 14:47.800
All right.                      

14:47.900 --> 14:49.600
          Sammy, I need a break.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.900
         I cannot... move.      

14:51.900 --> 14:52.900
                Oh, yeah,       
                take a break.   

14:52.900 --> 14:54.600
Why don't you get yourself      
            a beer?             

14:57.200 --> 14:58.800
              Okay, fellows, I'm
        playing for Norm now.   

14:58.900 --> 15:00.000
                             Go!
                          Sammy!

15:00.100 --> 15:01.200
                    Oh, there   
                         you go.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.500
                     Fast break,
                          Kevin.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.800
Whoo!                           

15:03.800 --> 15:05.000
                 Yeah. Don't you
                  love teamwork?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.300
          (laughing):           
        Well, say,              
        don't you think         

15:06.400 --> 15:07.900
    maybe somebody ought to     
    go in for McHale?           

15:08.000 --> 15:09.900
I mean, he's the only one       
  been playing the whole game.  

15:10.000 --> 15:11.100
                    What, are   
                    you nuts?   

15:11.100 --> 15:12.600
            What, we're ahead   
            by, what, 70 points?

15:12.600 --> 15:14.500
                 I don't want to
             just beat this guy.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.600
    I want to humiliate him.    

15:15.700 --> 15:18.100
I want to hear that clown, Gary,
    scream for mercy.           

15:18.300 --> 15:20.500
                     (screaming)

15:20.600 --> 15:23.000
                     That wasn't
                Gary, was it?   

15:23.100 --> 15:24.200
    Sorry, Mr. McHale.          

15:24.300 --> 15:26.500
      You know, sometimes       
 you can just pop these babies  

15:26.600 --> 15:27.700
        right back              
          into place.           

15:27.800 --> 15:29.200
                     (screaming)

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
        Maybe not.              

15:40.900 --> 15:42.100
    Gary, it's Carla.           

15:42.200 --> 15:44.400
 Yeah, the guys just wanted me  
      to give you a call,       

15:44.500 --> 15:46.300
tell you that you left something
          at the gym.           

15:46.400 --> 15:47.900
Your money!                     
                     Your pride!

15:48.000 --> 15:50.800
Did you lose a blue gym bag?    

15:50.900 --> 15:52.100
         Cheers rules!          

15:52.200 --> 15:55.300
    (cheering and whooping)     

15:55.300 --> 15:56.700
                Oh, man, victory
                    is so sweet.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.100
    This is even better than the
time we didn't lose so badly.   

15:59.100 --> 16:00.200
              You remember that?

16:01.500 --> 16:03.200
Yeah, but the best part         
was Kevin getting up            

16:03.200 --> 16:06.400
and walking off the court,      
knowing his foot was okay.      

16:06.500 --> 16:10.500
        No, no, The best part   
         was Gary's total defeat
                and humiliation.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.700
                         Yeah...
Yeah, that was                  
the best part.                  

16:12.800 --> 16:14.700
Yeah, did you see his face      
        when we told him        

16:14.700 --> 16:16.600
     we were going to give      
     his money to charity?      

16:16.700 --> 16:17.600
Yeah, you know,                 
uh, those moppets               

16:17.700 --> 16:18.900
will be glad                    
to get the money.               

16:19.000 --> 16:21.700
Yeah, a lot they did for it.    
                        Yeah.   

16:21.700 --> 16:23.400
              SAM:              
         Anyway, uh...          

16:23.400 --> 16:25.300
  that orphanage guy is coming  
  over here in a little while   

16:25.400 --> 16:27.100
    to take the money back.     

16:27.100 --> 16:30.900
You know, Sam, I, uh, don't know
    if I've told you,           

16:30.900 --> 16:32.700
     but tragically I lost      

16:32.800 --> 16:35.200
 both my parents when I was...  

16:35.300 --> 16:37.900
      oh, in my early 30s.      

16:39.300 --> 16:42.200
  I could sure use that money.  

16:42.200 --> 16:44.300
                    Say, Lilith,
                 how about that?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.500
                    Would $5,000
                buy anything?   

16:48.800 --> 16:50.200
             What?              

16:50.200 --> 16:51.400
            Nothing, dear.      

16:51.500 --> 16:54.100
I'm getting nothing here.       

16:56.600 --> 16:58.200
          Mr. Malone?           

16:58.300 --> 16:59.400
Yeah, over here.                

16:59.500 --> 17:01.100
I'm Dr, Walter Froenmeyer       

17:01.200 --> 17:02.600
    with the Celtics'           
         medical staff.         

17:02.700 --> 17:04.900
        Uh, yeah?               
I wanted to get                 
your version                    

17:05.000 --> 17:07.599
of Mr. McHale's                 
accident last night.            

17:07.700 --> 17:09.200
  Oh, well, uh... no big deal.  

17:09.300 --> 17:11.000
         He fell down,          
      we put him back up.       

17:11.000 --> 17:12.300
        Nothing serious.        

17:12.300 --> 17:14.599
      Does this look like       
    nothing serious to you?     

17:14.599 --> 17:18.000
                 God! The skin's
                    all gone.   

17:21.599 --> 17:25.099
This hairline fracture          
runs the entire length          

17:25.099 --> 17:26.099
of the metatarsal,              

17:26.200 --> 17:27.599
which would indicate            
there was some sort             

17:27.599 --> 17:29.200
of a jarring after              
the initial impact.             

17:29.300 --> 17:30.500
                      It was me!

17:30.500 --> 17:32.800
  I fell on him and then I tried
      to pop it back into place.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.900
                I'm sorry!      

17:34.000 --> 17:35.100
        Woody, Woody...         

17:35.100 --> 17:36.200
  Excuse me just for a second.  

17:36.300 --> 17:37.400
Woody, Woody, no,               
now come on.                    

17:37.500 --> 17:39.000
Don't blame yourself.           

17:39.000 --> 17:41.600
You were just at the wrong place
at the wrong time, that's all.  

17:41.700 --> 17:43.000
        If anything led to this,
  it was Sam's pigheaded refusal

17:43.100 --> 17:44.400
              to take McHale out
            of the game earlier.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.500
What are you talking about?     

17:45.600 --> 17:48.200
Woody's the clod                
who broke his foot.             
                        Oh, God!

17:48.200 --> 17:49.500
FROENMEYER:                     
If you'll excuse me,            

17:49.600 --> 17:51.800
I've got a whole gang           
of reporters back at the Garden 

17:51.900 --> 17:54.300
waiting to find out why         
McHale's out for the season.    

17:54.300 --> 17:55.700
                 Wait a minute--
             out for the season?

17:55.800 --> 17:58.300
              Oh, my God. People
              are gonna hate us.

17:58.300 --> 18:01.000
Hate us? Man they'll kill us    
first, then they'll hate us.    

18:01.000 --> 18:02.300
                            SAM:
              Excuse me, Doctor,

18:02.300 --> 18:03.500
    listen, there's no need     

18:03.600 --> 18:05.500
    for you to mention          
 the bar's name, now, is there? 

18:05.500 --> 18:06.700
        Why shouldn't I?        

18:06.700 --> 18:08.300
         Professional courtesy. 

18:08.400 --> 18:10.500
I'm a doctor.                   
You're a bartender.             

18:10.600 --> 18:12.300
    We're both professionals.   

18:12.400 --> 18:15.000
      Sam, wait a minute,       
let me do this. all right?      

18:15.000 --> 18:18.500
  Doc, how much would it take   
  to put a hook in your mouth?  

18:18.600 --> 18:20.000
        $10,000.                

18:20.000 --> 18:21.900
                    Five.       
        Deal.                   

18:23.800 --> 18:25.700
Now, she's a professional.      

18:27.600 --> 18:30.000
Hey, great work there, Carla.   

18:30.000 --> 18:31.200
                Right. Dodged   
                    that bullet.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.700
    Way to go, Carla.           

18:32.800 --> 18:35.800
I want my                       
money back.                     

18:35.900 --> 18:37.600
                Oh, for goodness
                 sakes, Frasier,

18:37.600 --> 18:40.100
     we've been intimate several
          times this last month.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.600
         Look at my day planner.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.100
          We were together every
             night this weekend.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.000
            Oh, good heavens!   
                That wasn't you.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.700
What do you mean                
it wasn't me?                   

18:48.800 --> 18:50.200
          I'm kidding.          

18:50.300 --> 18:52.100
  See? Look how tense you are.  
 You wouldn't enjoy it anyway.  

18:54.400 --> 18:55.800
          Well, fine.           

18:55.900 --> 18:57.500
    I don't want it anyway.     

18:57.500 --> 18:58.600
          You do, too.          

18:58.700 --> 18:59.200
        I do not.               

18:59.300 --> 18:59.900
        You do so.              

19:00.000 --> 19:00.700
        All right, I do.        

19:00.900 --> 19:03.300
Well, you're not getting any.   

19:03.400 --> 19:06.600
    Oh, Frasier, isn't it enough
 that I'm doing it to your mind?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.500
          Hey, Sammy.           

19:14.500 --> 19:15.400
              You're walking!   

19:15.500 --> 19:17.600
    Kevin, when did you get     
      out of the hospital?      

19:17.600 --> 19:19.200
     What are you talking about?

19:19.300 --> 19:20.900
        Talking about your foot.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.100
         Aw, it's fine.         

19:22.200 --> 19:24.100
    I iced it down for about    
  a half hour after the game.   

19:24.200 --> 19:25.200
          Feels great.          

19:25.300 --> 19:26.700
            Whoa, whoa, whoa,   
                  wait a second.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.100
    Who-Whose X-ray is this,    
        then, huh?              

19:28.200 --> 19:29.200
            Is that not yours?  

19:29.200 --> 19:31.100
I don't know. Let me            
take a look at it.              

19:31.100 --> 19:33.800
 It says "adult male gorilla."  

19:33.800 --> 19:37.700
         That's not me.         
    Could be Laimbeer, huh?     

19:41.300 --> 19:43.100
Oh man, I can't believe this.   

19:43.200 --> 19:44.600
  Gary sends in a fake doctor   
      to steal our money.       

19:44.700 --> 19:45.900
        Do you believe that?    

19:46.000 --> 19:48.600
              SAM:              
    God! Even when we           
    beat him, he wins.          

19:48.700 --> 19:51.000
Hey, Sam, I'd like you          
to meet Father Conrad here,     

19:51.100 --> 19:52.400
from the Sunny Grove            
Orphanage.                      

19:52.500 --> 19:54.800
                    Yeah, hi.   
I hope you don't mind           
that we brought                 

19:54.900 --> 19:56.600
a photographer along.           
Listen, Sam, why don't you      

19:56.700 --> 19:58.900
  come on around there and get  
  a picture with Father and I   

19:59.000 --> 20:00.300
         and the $5,000         
    you're giving us.           

20:00.400 --> 20:01.500
Come on.                        

20:01.600 --> 20:03.600
      You want to do this,      
        uh... right now?        

20:03.600 --> 20:04.900
        Yeah. Come on over.     
             Let's go.          

20:06.100 --> 20:07.300
Okay. I'll be right there.      

20:10.100 --> 20:11.600
        What are we gonna do?   

20:11.700 --> 20:13.300
    All right, short people     
        in front.               

20:15.600 --> 20:17.200
              Look what you did!

20:17.300 --> 20:20.600
        You made me smack you   
        in front of a priest!   

20:23.700 --> 20:24.800
          Boys, boys,           
     we can work this out.      

20:24.900 --> 20:26.300
             Yeah, how? We don't
                 have any money.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.600
No, no, no, but we've got a lot 
of people in here, right?       

20:28.700 --> 20:31.100
      How about we collect      
    as much money as we can,    
                    That's good.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.500
    we give it to him,          

20:32.600 --> 20:34.800
and then we make sure everybody 
knows that Gary's the one       

20:34.900 --> 20:37.800
that stole the 5,000 bucks      
        from those kids.        
NORM:                           
There you go.                   

20:39.500 --> 20:42.500
Uh, give me some money.         
It's for a good cause.          

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
                  What cause?   

20:43.700 --> 20:45.700
'Cause I said.                  

20:47.600 --> 20:50.700
    Hey, Sammy, Father and I    
  were just talking about it.   

20:50.700 --> 20:52.500
Those kids are really going     
to enjoy that money.            

20:52.600 --> 20:54.300
        Gonna get some shoes,   
              some eyeglasses...

20:54.400 --> 20:56.500
    You know, Kevin, we don't   
              quite have $5,000,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.000
                but we're pretty
              darned close here.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.100
          Sammy, Sammy, where is
             the orphans' money?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.300
                      He has it.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.000
            (booing)            

21:03.000 --> 21:05.300
        Thank you, Sam.         

21:05.400 --> 21:06.900
Thank you all for coming.       

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
  Father, on behalf of Gary's   
    Old Towne Tavern,           

21:10.000 --> 21:12.500
    I'd like to present you     
    with a souvenir jacket,     

21:12.500 --> 21:15.000
and we have one                 
for you, too, Kevin,            

21:15.200 --> 21:18.000
with extra-long sleeves.        

21:18.100 --> 21:19.800
                    Oh, nice!   
Uh-huh.                         

21:21.500 --> 21:24.800
Here's a little check           
for those wonderful kids.       

21:24.900 --> 21:26.400
$5,000, Kevin.                  

21:26.500 --> 21:28.800
$5,000! That's great.           

21:28.900 --> 21:31.500
    Hey Gar, let's get          
    a picture with it.          
That's a great idea.            

21:31.600 --> 21:33.300
Sam, would you get              
out of the way here.            

21:33.400 --> 21:34.400
You're blocking                 
the check.                      

21:34.500 --> 21:35.600
                     We've got a
                  donation, too.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.600
            Hold on a second.   

21:36.700 --> 21:38.000
            How much            
         have you got?          

21:38.100 --> 21:41.900
     $11 and, uh, 75 cents.     

21:42.000 --> 21:44.100
That's so cute.                 

21:44.200 --> 21:46.800
Uh, gentlemen,                  
I have a bus outside.           

21:46.800 --> 21:48.800
We can swing by,                
pick up the orphans,            

21:48.800 --> 21:50.800
and we can drive them           
over to Gary's                  

21:50.900 --> 21:51.900
for some milk and cookies.      

21:51.900 --> 21:53.300
         What do you think,     
              Father?           

21:53.300 --> 21:56.400
    I think that's fine.        
It's a great idea.              
Come on!                        

21:56.500 --> 21:58.000
                    You don't   
                understand, man.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.800
                    That $5,000,
            that's our money.   

21:59.900 --> 22:02.100
Shame on you, Sam.              

22:02.200 --> 22:03.600
You know it's                   
the orphans' money.             

22:03.700 --> 22:06.700
Hey, Gar, thanks a lot          
for the five grand.             

22:06.700 --> 22:08.600
 Get out of here. I don't want  
to see you again. You're a bum. 

22:08.800 --> 22:10.500
                  Go on. Get out
                    of my place.
                Go on, scoot.   

22:10.600 --> 22:11.800
    Fine. Fine.                 

22:11.800 --> 22:14.600
Eight years of humiliating      
you weenies is enough.          

22:14.700 --> 22:16.800
I'm gonna find a tougher        
gang to humiliate.              

22:16.900 --> 22:18.700
    Hey, you can look           
        all over Boston.        

22:18.700 --> 22:21.700
You won't find any weenies      
        tougher than us!        

22:21.800 --> 22:24.200
                    Yeah, that's
             telling him, Woody.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.200
              Huh?              

22:26.200 --> 22:28.100
Sam, we've got to               
get back at Gary.               

22:28.200 --> 22:29.400
              Worse than we ever
                got them before.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.800
                        Come on,
                 let's get Gary.

22:30.900 --> 22:34.600
         Let's get Gary!        
Let's get Gary! Let's get Gary! 

22:34.700 --> 22:35.900
              SAM:              
        Come on...              
Let's get Gary! Let's get Gary! 

22:36.000 --> 22:36.900
                 Aw, don't worry
                    about it.   

22:37.000 --> 22:38.500
        Let's get Gary!         
        Let's get Gary!         

22:38.500 --> 22:40.400
                Come on.        
        What are we doing?      

22:40.400 --> 22:41.800
          Man, we're pathetic!  

22:41.800 --> 22:43.100
            We've been trying   

22:43.100 --> 22:45.000
  to get Gary for eight years!  

22:45.100 --> 22:46.500
         We never win!          

22:46.500 --> 22:48.500
                We're pathetic. 

22:48.600 --> 22:51.300
  There's nobody more pathetic  
  than us in the whole world.   

22:53.600 --> 22:55.400
             Oh, please, Lilith.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.700
                 Anything.      

22:56.800 --> 22:59.400
        A back rub. A handshake.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.100
            Blow me a kiss.     

23:06.700 --> 23:08.300
              We're not Frasier.
              We're not Frasier.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.800
          (chanting):           
    We're not Frasier!          
    We're not Frasier!          

23:11.800 --> 23:13.800
       <i>We're not Frasier!</i>
