WEBVTT

00:11.238 --> 00:13.040
Let me go now, please.

00:13.071 --> 00:14.337
Your wife's sick.

00:14.363 --> 00:15.787
What if I could help her?

00:15.867 --> 00:19.982
Khatri found someone with
altered genetic qualities.

00:20.008 --> 00:21.767
A way to repair diseases.

00:21.793 --> 00:22.883
Speak to Khatri.

00:22.909 --> 00:24.721
(SCREAMS)

00:24.747 --> 00:26.291
We need to get you to the hospital.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.513
You need stitches.

00:27.793 --> 00:29.721
Talk to her. Calm her down.

00:29.747 --> 00:30.947
Let me go!

00:30.973 --> 00:32.276
Who's the extraction?

00:32.302 --> 00:33.302
It's the sheriff.

00:33.328 --> 00:34.728
Anything we should know?

00:34.754 --> 00:36.321
Bit of a character apparently.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.137
It's not this boy who'll kill the demon.

00:39.163 --> 00:42.116
It's you. Only Dan.

00:43.446 --> 00:44.750
Too late.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.226
Sheriff.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.463
Sheriff Anderssen?

01:57.198 --> 01:58.739
Governor Munk.

02:01.249 --> 02:04.216
The, um, the man you brought out.

02:04.242 --> 02:06.524
The, uh, the dead man.

02:06.908 --> 02:07.936
Yup?

02:12.181 --> 02:13.586
He made a confession?

02:14.336 --> 02:15.727
He certainly did.

02:22.644 --> 02:23.894
Is that his blood?

02:24.772 --> 02:25.829
Yep.

02:27.965 --> 02:29.312
Did you do this?

02:31.124 --> 02:33.257
No. He did it all on his own.

02:34.624 --> 02:36.324
Mutilated himself.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.790
Cut off his own genitals.

02:45.696 --> 02:48.855
Well, who knows the full
extent of his madness?

02:49.517 --> 02:50.704
Hmm.

02:51.552 --> 02:52.606
Tomak,

02:53.434 --> 02:54.857
Governor Odegard...

02:58.676 --> 02:59.972
Bianca Mankyo,

03:00.766 --> 03:02.032
the geologist.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.038
- Hindemith.
- Hindemith.

03:05.665 --> 03:07.094
Perhaps we'll never know.

03:11.955 --> 03:13.347
It was a...

03:13.373 --> 03:14.862
A blessing you stopped him.

03:16.395 --> 03:17.828
A fucking blessing.

03:26.502 --> 03:28.334
Out of my way, please.

03:35.528 --> 03:40.233
Lars has found a body
and this eyeball in a car.

03:40.601 --> 03:43.266
He recognized the
deceased as Trude Ekeland.

03:43.292 --> 03:44.391
This is her eye.

03:46.217 --> 03:47.217
Where's the car?

03:47.283 --> 03:48.526
Top road.

03:51.140 --> 03:52.603
You're coming with me.

03:58.303 --> 03:59.918
When a parasite infects a host,

03:59.944 --> 04:02.017
manipulation of the
host's genome can occur

04:02.083 --> 04:03.195
at an epigenetic level.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.500
Uh-huh. Go on.

04:06.606 --> 04:08.591
The parasite and the host
are competing inside

04:08.617 --> 04:11.617
the same genetic space
and something has to give.

04:13.117 --> 04:14.260
What gives?

04:14.382 --> 04:15.598
Dan Anderssen.

04:16.437 --> 04:17.724
What's he got to do with this?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.190
He was infested by the wasp larvae.

04:20.488 --> 04:21.954
Should have died but he didn't.

04:21.980 --> 04:22.991
He changed.

04:23.017 --> 04:25.350
I've already witnessed
his increased pain thresholds,

04:25.417 --> 04:29.410
his aggression, vitality
and most significant,

04:29.863 --> 04:33.244
his ability to regenerate
damaged tissue.

04:35.815 --> 04:37.643
Tissue regeneration, Michael.

04:39.259 --> 04:40.478
Everything I do,

04:41.346 --> 04:45.310
everything that motivates me,
my work and knowledge

04:45.336 --> 04:46.902
is about hope.

04:48.604 --> 04:50.190
This might be Freya's hope.

04:52.474 --> 04:54.074
You need to bring him to me.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.305
Yeah, you want me to bring him to you?

05:05.137 --> 05:06.387
Open this.

05:11.785 --> 05:13.078
More padding.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.238
Especially around the head.

05:15.323 --> 05:17.047
The lining's thermally insulated.

05:17.546 --> 05:19.073
Sedative drip in here.

05:19.099 --> 05:20.341
Delivery timer.

05:20.617 --> 05:22.017
Keep him under once he's in the chopper.

05:22.083 --> 05:25.407
Good. Last thing I want's
a ruckus in a helicopter.

05:35.071 --> 05:36.493
Did you enjoy it?

05:36.750 --> 05:37.817
Killing him?

05:40.850 --> 05:44.059
I don't know that I enjoy
anything much anymore, Petra.

05:45.031 --> 05:47.101
I see the thing that has to be done

05:47.606 --> 05:49.839
and I have no hesitation in doing it.

05:51.773 --> 05:53.683
Who decides what has to be done?

05:56.310 --> 05:57.777
It declares itself.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.570
I never used to see things so clearly.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.385
But things change.

06:09.613 --> 06:10.713
People don't.

06:14.793 --> 06:16.760
Dan Anderssen killed Vladek.

06:17.128 --> 06:19.424
That's not the Dan Anderssen we knew.

06:19.956 --> 06:21.808
That's some kind of monster.

06:22.844 --> 06:24.944
What Doctor Khatri thinks is,

06:25.629 --> 06:27.135
is that monster,

06:28.541 --> 06:29.911
it could be...

06:30.515 --> 06:32.666
could be the hope we're looking for.

06:46.150 --> 06:48.187
If I sit here with you honey,

06:49.517 --> 06:52.169
and I don't try this one last thing...

06:53.370 --> 06:54.867
And I lose you?

06:58.248 --> 07:00.179
I wouldn't be your Michael.

07:32.728 --> 07:34.580
I love you, girl.

08:15.384 --> 08:16.644
Hmm.

08:18.050 --> 08:19.683
Both her eyes are gone.

08:22.883 --> 08:24.827
Did she do this to herself?

08:25.474 --> 08:26.742
Yep.

08:27.351 --> 08:29.579
She has a sister in Vukobejina.

08:30.317 --> 08:32.181
It's happening again.

08:32.703 --> 08:34.878
When everything went crazy before,

08:35.982 --> 08:37.917
the one thing that kept me sane,

08:38.304 --> 08:40.273
that I clung too all the...

08:42.500 --> 08:44.133
all the time...

08:50.547 --> 08:53.869
No matter how dark and frightening,

08:54.674 --> 08:56.306
I trusted you...

08:56.883 --> 08:58.181
Guarding us.

08:59.127 --> 09:01.489
I felt safe here,

09:01.968 --> 09:03.829
even in that madness.

09:05.868 --> 09:07.572
And then you were so sick.

09:08.787 --> 09:10.095
All those weeks.

09:12.097 --> 09:13.501
And what came back...

09:18.392 --> 09:20.651
Like Dan died

09:21.346 --> 09:23.846
and walked over into
the land of the dead

09:25.129 --> 09:26.963
and a demon took his shape...

09:30.465 --> 09:32.931
and came back into the world amongst us.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.124
I look at your face, Petra.

09:46.055 --> 09:49.425
And for the first time ever,
I see it in you.

09:50.197 --> 09:51.304
What?

09:52.619 --> 09:55.665
Sami. Reindeer herder.

09:56.941 --> 10:00.183
The blood of the tundra
flowing in your veins,

10:00.706 --> 10:03.846
beneath your beautiful pale skin.

10:06.876 --> 10:08.276
Did you kill Elena?

10:10.901 --> 10:12.117
Yes.

10:13.794 --> 10:15.203
I think I did.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.118
She wanted me to.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.133
Hey...

10:37.118 --> 10:39.351
I'll drive Trude back in to town.

10:50.710 --> 10:51.964
It's like...

10:52.847 --> 10:55.453
Like I've had the most wonderful,

10:55.642 --> 10:58.781
like, peaceful sleep.

10:59.273 --> 11:00.417
Yeah?

11:00.638 --> 11:02.677
Yeah. Vincent. Yes.

11:03.193 --> 11:07.457
Like I can't remember
ever having before,

11:07.483 --> 11:08.660
in all my life.

11:09.575 --> 11:11.723
All the things I was worried about...

11:11.749 --> 11:14.522
Work. You.

11:15.287 --> 11:17.826
The shit I thought Khatri was up to.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.746
It was just evaporated.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.891
Love and goodwill, Vincent.

11:25.917 --> 11:28.965
I know it sounds like hippy shit but I,

11:29.872 --> 11:31.731
honestly... I mean...

11:32.974 --> 11:35.250
(SIGHS)

11:39.502 --> 11:42.715
And I heard a chorus, a choir.

11:42.988 --> 11:44.368
It was celestial.

11:44.394 --> 11:46.183
That's the word.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.507
Shit.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.825
Oh, he's not there.
Just the girl on her own.

12:20.987 --> 12:22.133
Leave her!

13:12.166 --> 13:13.644
What happened?

13:14.817 --> 13:15.917
Shh.

13:16.117 --> 13:17.706
Don't move, Petra.

13:18.304 --> 13:20.549
- Your car got hit...
- I'm okay...

13:21.176 --> 13:22.343
Hey, be still.

13:22.715 --> 13:23.781
Let me up.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.983
Let me go!

13:30.651 --> 13:33.684
Let me go! Don't kill me, Dan!

13:34.446 --> 13:38.946
Please! Let me go! Please!

14:07.167 --> 14:08.656
Dan Anderssen!

14:16.202 --> 14:17.422
Petra?

14:20.278 --> 14:21.594
Sheriff around?

14:25.087 --> 14:29.007
Petra, I am looking for Dan Anderssen.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.454
Dan's gone.

14:31.850 --> 14:33.117
I'm pretty sure.

14:35.906 --> 14:37.228
You're gonna help me.

14:46.217 --> 14:48.260
I know where Dan was...

14:48.351 --> 14:49.986
last time he was Dan.

14:50.012 --> 14:51.368
We'll start there then.

14:52.290 --> 14:53.439
Come on.

14:56.135 --> 14:57.458
I have one task:

14:57.500 --> 14:59.383
the extraction of Dan Anderssen.

14:59.409 --> 15:02.441
Yes, of course. I understand.

15:03.151 --> 15:04.340
What about Khatri?

15:04.980 --> 15:06.316
She'll be leaving, too.

15:07.855 --> 15:10.967
I'll make my own
arrangements, fair enough.

15:11.548 --> 15:12.733
No.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.800
No?

15:14.952 --> 15:16.206
You're staying.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.643
The fuck do you mean by that?

15:17.669 --> 15:18.976
What I mean by that,

15:19.002 --> 15:22.014
is Schenthal Pharma

15:22.040 --> 15:26.219
have paid you, to date, 185,000 euros

15:26.245 --> 15:27.700
for managing this mess.

15:28.303 --> 15:32.169
And before you go
anywhere you'll earn it.

15:32.273 --> 15:35.139
And... If I refuse?

15:36.033 --> 15:37.767
(CHUCKLES)

16:26.606 --> 16:28.067
I found him here.

16:28.377 --> 16:30.377
Not long after he went missing.

16:31.628 --> 16:33.011
Completely...

16:33.856 --> 16:35.619
completely crazy.

16:35.645 --> 16:38.467
Chained to the stairs.

16:38.985 --> 16:40.767
I was afraid he was gonna die.

16:41.123 --> 16:44.817
He was raging, fevered,

16:45.929 --> 16:48.554
drinking everything, purging.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.541
- For two months.
- Two months?

16:53.315 --> 16:54.968
Doctor Khatri said that Dan

16:54.994 --> 16:57.700
had that parasite inside
him all that time.

16:59.788 --> 17:02.233
Everyone else that was
infected like Dan was,

17:02.300 --> 17:03.800
they all attacked someone.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.810
He saw it coming.

17:14.569 --> 17:19.173
He fought the thing, all by himself.

17:24.316 --> 17:25.915
Why didn't you tell someone?

17:32.163 --> 17:33.790
Because you love him?

17:37.079 --> 17:38.634
Where did you get this stuff?

17:39.532 --> 17:41.127
In Vukobejina.

17:41.205 --> 17:42.908
A colleague, they knew all about it.

17:42.934 --> 17:44.467
They acquired the knowledge
from the Sami Shaman

17:44.533 --> 17:46.400
and reindeer herders.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.475
It's known as reindeer
juice, or muscimol.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.470
It'll protect me, against all this
blindness shit that's coming?

17:53.282 --> 17:55.970
Well, I obviously used it
myself when I was there.

17:56.337 --> 17:57.441
Jesus.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.087
How did that work out?

18:00.345 --> 18:01.900
Some side effects.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.309
Side effects?

18:05.262 --> 18:06.376
What kind of side effects?

18:06.473 --> 18:07.933
Mild hallucinations.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.441
What, like cannabis?

18:10.547 --> 18:12.185
I've never used cannabis.

18:13.938 --> 18:15.538
No, I bet you haven't.

18:17.328 --> 18:19.517
Ah Jesus, Jesus..

18:19.814 --> 18:21.306
That, be careful!

18:22.961 --> 18:26.626
That's really, that's really painful.

18:29.249 --> 18:31.973
When I was told to hold back
the fuel for the fleet,

18:32.264 --> 18:33.651
I was in fear of my life.

18:34.003 --> 18:35.100
I know...

18:35.345 --> 18:36.976
First because I thought Dag Tannar

18:37.002 --> 18:38.396
was going to knock my block off.

18:38.656 --> 18:42.278
And then because Hildur
was glaring at me.

18:44.075 --> 18:45.933
Like a beady-eyed herring-gull.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.567
I don't think that's right.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.571
And I mean no disrespect when I say this

18:49.597 --> 18:51.844
but I always thought Governor Odegard

18:51.870 --> 18:53.191
was a very attractive woman.

18:55.607 --> 18:56.807
Sexy?

18:56.833 --> 18:58.577
Yes. That's what I mean.

19:01.381 --> 19:02.631
Hildur.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.028
CROWD: Hildur!

19:11.438 --> 19:15.775
When I, uh, when I put on this jacket.

19:16.025 --> 19:18.681
I become every man and
woman in this bar.

19:22.142 --> 19:25.331
All of us loved Hildur Odegard.

19:27.110 --> 19:30.200
I'm just the one wearing the jacket

19:30.267 --> 19:32.400
while you're all too busy going to work

19:32.467 --> 19:35.920
and raising families and
doing what Hildur wanted.

19:40.898 --> 19:42.964
Hildur Odegard was murdered.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.700
She killed herself.

19:49.161 --> 19:50.213
No.

19:51.562 --> 19:52.882
She was murdered.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.400
In cold blood.

19:54.656 --> 19:56.826
Her killer made it look like suicide.

19:56.852 --> 19:58.969
Murdered? Hildur was murdered?

20:00.998 --> 20:02.536
So who murdered her?

20:04.418 --> 20:05.848
I'll show you.

20:20.471 --> 20:22.330
He's got the whole town with him.

20:28.881 --> 20:30.481
All the hard drives.

20:31.753 --> 20:33.518
- She infected?
- Yes.

20:33.851 --> 20:35.051
How advanced is she?

20:35.077 --> 20:36.774
Very. She's nearly done.

20:44.889 --> 20:46.494
Right, are you going
to need all this stuff?

20:46.520 --> 20:47.674
Incinerator.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.191
Always liked you, Hildur.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.421
Always thought that we had

21:05.780 --> 21:11.314
an awful lot more in common than
we were able to acknowledge.

21:14.384 --> 21:16.306
You had Eric.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.900
I had Phyllisha.

21:24.691 --> 21:28.433
Things could have been
very, very different.

21:33.633 --> 21:34.567
Mmm.

21:37.050 --> 21:40.333
No need for that kind of language.

21:42.700 --> 21:46.296
I am not a murdering bastard!

21:52.917 --> 21:54.362
It was an accident!

21:58.252 --> 21:59.448
Shh!

22:12.704 --> 22:14.931
Keep your fucking voice down!

22:19.155 --> 22:21.037
From inside that office,

22:21.570 --> 22:24.350
Hildur Odegard protected us.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.463
Cared for us.

22:29.533 --> 22:32.313
Your families. Your kids.

22:35.541 --> 22:40.153
And in there now, is
the man who killed her.

22:41.244 --> 22:45.639
Erling Munk pushed Hildur Odegard
into a hole in the ice.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.633
What the fuck?

22:47.369 --> 22:49.967
Lars, you saw him out there.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.289
Yes, I did!

22:51.771 --> 22:54.552
Ralfi, you sent her to meet him!

22:54.578 --> 22:56.341
- Arrest him!
- Yes, arrest him!

22:56.367 --> 22:57.500
Arrest him?

22:57.526 --> 22:58.878
Of course, fucking arrest him!

22:58.904 --> 23:00.333
He's the governor.

23:00.441 --> 23:01.741
He killed the governor!

23:01.767 --> 23:04.921
Erling Munk is
the governor of Fortitude.

23:04.947 --> 23:07.867
Erling Munk is the chief
of police of Fortitude.

23:07.933 --> 23:09.767
They all love you.

23:11.241 --> 23:13.158
This is all your fault.

23:14.002 --> 23:16.300
- She was our shepherd!
- (CLAMORING)

23:16.367 --> 23:19.160
She saved this town,
when it all went to hell!

23:19.186 --> 23:20.153
Yes!

23:20.179 --> 23:24.316
I am his sheriff. I answer to him!

23:25.641 --> 23:27.679
He murdered Hildur!

23:28.167 --> 23:29.391
Oh, you want justice?

23:29.417 --> 23:30.839
ALL: Yes!

23:31.636 --> 23:33.133
You want the rule of law?

23:33.200 --> 23:35.233
Yes, we want the fucking rule of law.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.367
The law you want is in your own hands!

23:39.433 --> 23:40.633
(CLAMORING)

23:40.700 --> 23:42.900
- Get him!
- Kill the fucker!

23:45.300 --> 23:46.400
Get him!

24:09.733 --> 24:11.700
(SHOUTING)

24:55.692 --> 24:56.957
Dan.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.300
It's Michael Lennox.

25:13.837 --> 25:15.170
(GRUNTS)

25:22.004 --> 25:23.067
Khatri!

25:23.655 --> 25:25.033
Doctor Khatri, wait!

25:25.100 --> 25:26.216
Where are you going?

25:26.698 --> 25:29.500
Please. You can't leave.
I can't help her by myself.

25:29.567 --> 25:30.833
Hey! Quieten down.

25:30.900 --> 25:31.967
Fuck off!

25:31.993 --> 25:33.149
Hey, no, don't.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.908
Fuck!

25:38.822 --> 25:40.856
You need to find her
some reindeer juice.

25:40.993 --> 25:43.653
More infection is on
the way from Vukobejina.

25:43.679 --> 25:44.895
Fuck!

25:50.620 --> 25:53.233
Stay down, out of sight till
we get to the airport.

26:17.956 --> 26:19.061
(MICHAEL GRUNTS)

26:33.125 --> 26:35.356
You pulled me out of
that burning cave, Michael.

26:41.664 --> 26:43.233
This is the miracle.

26:43.300 --> 26:44.967
This is what you're searching for.

26:46.890 --> 26:48.862
And you're not the only one.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.483
Hey. Hey. Sorry.

27:13.550 --> 27:14.450
Hey, sorry. The, uh...

27:14.517 --> 27:15.617
I need the reindeer juice.

27:15.683 --> 27:17.083
The woman you brought back. The soldier.

27:17.150 --> 27:18.497
You... you had some in a box.
Where is it?

27:18.523 --> 27:20.094
My, my dad took it from us.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.033
- Where, where did he put it?
- He destroyed it.

27:22.059 --> 27:24.283
- Why would he do that?
- Because it's drugs.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.083
We could go to prison.
He didn't want it around.

27:26.109 --> 27:27.457
He didn't want us taking it
or selling it or anything.

27:27.483 --> 27:29.262
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

27:29.288 --> 27:30.950
Give me the muscimol! I need it!

27:31.017 --> 27:32.283
I have to have the reindeer juice!

27:32.309 --> 27:33.491
Hey! You can't come in here and yell!

27:33.517 --> 27:34.657
My mum is sick!

27:34.683 --> 27:36.117
It's the cure for Natalie.

27:36.143 --> 27:37.883
For everyone that's gonna
get this fucking thing

27:37.909 --> 27:40.028
that Dr. Khatri say's is
coming at us from Vukobejina.

27:40.185 --> 27:41.917
If Rune says Dad destroyed it

27:41.943 --> 27:44.143
then he destroyed it
and that's all there is.

27:45.403 --> 27:46.562
He didn't.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.442
He hid it.

27:51.283 --> 27:52.851
I watched him.

27:53.550 --> 27:54.805
Where?

27:57.350 --> 27:58.562
Where did he put it?

28:59.385 --> 29:01.995
Petra, open the door.

29:04.521 --> 29:05.487
Munk's dead.

29:05.513 --> 29:07.646
I know. It was Dan.

29:09.390 --> 29:11.024
Open the door.

29:12.783 --> 29:13.854
Promise me.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.946
What?

29:15.391 --> 29:16.963
You won't kill Dan.

29:18.593 --> 29:20.650
He's no use to me dead.

30:29.850 --> 30:31.417
(GRUNTS)

30:37.883 --> 30:39.750
- Unclip your seatbelt.
- What?

30:39.776 --> 30:41.842
Unclip your seatbelt.

30:49.017 --> 30:51.737
- Take off your headset.
- Why?

30:52.776 --> 30:54.543
Just take off your headset.

31:37.191 --> 31:38.403
(DAN COUGHS)

31:44.650 --> 31:46.183
You're hunting me.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.602
Taser. Non-lethal.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.491
Uh-huh.

31:58.852 --> 32:01.769
When a polar bear catches its prey,

32:02.326 --> 32:03.892
it eats them alive.

32:03.926 --> 32:05.247
Did you know that?

32:06.083 --> 32:09.806
It's true. I saw it once.

32:09.922 --> 32:11.189
Bear took a man.

32:13.426 --> 32:14.674
Terrible thing.

32:16.189 --> 32:17.377
Terrible.

32:19.301 --> 32:21.219
But at the time I thought,

32:22.683 --> 32:26.837
"Wow, what must it be like?"

32:28.379 --> 32:32.983
The Shamans, they think that
when a bear devours a man,

32:33.489 --> 32:36.535
the man's spirit lives on in the bear.

32:40.283 --> 32:41.417
Tell me your name.

32:43.268 --> 32:44.261
What?

32:44.865 --> 32:46.042
Your name.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.017
So I know who's inside me.

32:51.301 --> 32:52.867
Fuck yourself.

32:53.350 --> 32:54.983

34:26.074 --> 34:28.074
Fucking cannibal.

35:06.342 --> 35:08.042
Fuck.

35:22.940 --> 35:25.573
- What the hell have you done to her?
- Me?

35:25.599 --> 35:28.286
You brought her here and look.

35:28.317 --> 35:29.983
I know what it is. I know what to do.

35:30.050 --> 35:32.917
There's nothing you can do for her now.

35:32.983 --> 35:34.840
Nothing but pray.

35:35.042 --> 35:36.142
Ah!

35:39.017 --> 35:40.550
Natalie, can you see anything?

35:40.617 --> 35:42.083
Can you see anything at all?

35:42.337 --> 35:45.017
Light and dark.

35:46.550 --> 35:47.638
That's it.

35:50.487 --> 35:52.221
There's nothing else now.

35:53.583 --> 35:57.217
Yes, there is. Yes, there is.

Michael Lennox!

38:39.940 --> 38:41.502
Ah!

38:49.251 --> 38:50.783
I know.

38:50.823 --> 38:52.565
Getting shot.

38:52.976 --> 38:55.205
Once experienced, never forgotten.

38:55.231 --> 38:56.829
I've never been shot

38:57.252 --> 39:00.157
but I've watched a variety of
fuckers rolling around in agony.

39:00.356 --> 39:01.983
The pain'll ebb as you bleed out.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.950
Oxygen to the brain depleting.

39:04.017 --> 39:05.556
No going back from this.

39:06.983 --> 39:11.311
You, you have to get him back.

39:13.544 --> 39:15.544
Hand him over to Khatri.

39:16.331 --> 39:18.183
I know about your wife.

39:23.052 --> 39:24.582
All I care about.

39:24.650 --> 39:25.519
Hey.

39:26.381 --> 39:27.573
I'll see to it.

You've done all you could.

(GUNSHOT)

40:11.252 --> 40:12.618
Is he alive?

40:15.462 --> 40:17.571
I don't know if he's alive or not.

40:18.281 --> 40:20.355
- He's not in his fucking box.
- It doesn't matter.

40:20.578 --> 40:23.041
Harry, get me home, I want to see Freya.

Make the demon human again.

41:00.284 --> 41:02.073
Save the town.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.597
Heal us all with your sacrifice.

41:09.743 --> 41:11.377
So many monsters.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.556
So much sacrifice.

Not enough for Dan.
