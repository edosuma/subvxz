WEBVTT

02:39.426 --> 02:43.230
I'm a pole dancer, but also a fighter.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.466
<i>I'll give it all I've got.</i>

04:09.883 --> 04:12.586
-That was close! She managed to hang on.
-She keeps her grip!

04:12.653 --> 04:15.689
-Maki fights on.
-Look at those skills.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.624
-She's got this.
-She made it. She made it.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.845
-She couldn't reach it.
-She fell down.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.230
I was able to get one. I'm okay with that.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.690
-No!
-No!

05:23.757 --> 05:24.991
Should've grabbed!

05:45.946 --> 05:48.649
-Oh, no! He lost his grip!
-Down he goes.

05:54.921 --> 05:57.858
I do them
because I like to learn from my body.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.561
<i>I like to find out where I can take it.</i>

06:06.933 --> 06:08.301
To the coil, please!

06:08.368 --> 06:11.705
He hangs there
with all the calluses from his training.

06:11.771 --> 06:12.672
Fer! Come on, Fer!

06:12.739 --> 06:16.042
He was going for the bonus.
He craves those extra points!

06:16.109 --> 06:17.678
Come on!

06:20.581 --> 06:22.449
He let himself fall.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.218
Go, Mexico!

06:25.619 --> 06:27.621
Now we'll see
how he's doing against the others.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.755
-What do you think?
-What?

06:28.822 --> 06:33.393
He's number one!
He's number one on that board, babe!

06:33.460 --> 06:36.163
-You're the greatest, man.
-Go, Mexico!

06:50.978 --> 06:53.046
<i>My name is Taeyoung Lee.</i>

06:53.613 --> 06:58.118
<i>I'm a stunt coordinator and director</i>
<i>for movies and TV shows.</i>

06:59.419 --> 07:02.789
About six months ago... My retina...

07:03.256 --> 07:05.091
<i>There was an injury.</i>

07:05.158 --> 07:09.863
Even after a surgery,
I can't really see with this eye.

07:59.146 --> 08:04.218
-Yes!
-Yes, Taeyoung Lee!

08:22.802 --> 08:24.971
He scored!

08:34.982 --> 08:38.452
He just fell off there.
But I'm worried if he got injured.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.495
-He seems to be fine.
-Yes, he's swimming.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.403
<i>An event in my life</i>
<i>made me a stronger person,</i>

10:37.470 --> 10:41.374
the loss of my grandpa. He was
my best friend and an example to me.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.677
<i>Continuing my life,</i>
<i>knowing he wasn't there,</i>

10:44.744 --> 10:46.312
made me a stronger person.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.414
I keep up with my choices today

10:48.481 --> 10:51.184
remembering the grandson
he believed Marcel would be.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.719
<i>I don't think I've let him down.</i>

11:08.067 --> 11:10.203
He managed to hold on!

11:10.270 --> 11:13.773
-He did it again!
-He did it hugging the pole!

12:18.805 --> 12:23.243
Marcel, you are in second place, bro.
Relax. Relax.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.912
You are already in, my man.

12:26.779 --> 12:30.817
That's it, Brazil. I put all my heart
and soul into this course.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.385
Brazil!

12:40.494 --> 12:43.397
My strategy? Look.

12:43.463 --> 12:48.702
Taking it easy,
I'll try to get the donuts extra point.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.754
Are you ready for this?

13:13.059 --> 13:14.894
And he looks a bit like Sideshow Bob.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.063
Absolutely. His hair is sensational.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.814
The great thing is, after this competition
is over, we can use his head

13:33.880 --> 13:37.717
to clean up everything
because he is wearing a mop.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.052
Great!

13:39.118 --> 13:40.920
Everything for Germany!

14:34.073 --> 14:37.410
I think the circus

14:37.477 --> 14:40.446
<i>is a modality that works</i>

14:40.513 --> 14:41.881
<i>the body in general.</i>

14:41.948 --> 14:45.184
<i>When I was introduced to the circus,</i>
<i>I found myself again.</i>

14:45.251 --> 14:47.887
<i>You are looking at the winner.</i>

16:26.787 --> 16:31.091
The Beast doesn't have
this name by chance.

16:31.557 --> 16:35.294
<i>It seems to be fun to conquer</i>

16:35.361 --> 16:36.929
<i>and very difficult.</i>

16:43.736 --> 16:45.338
I'm a bit nervous.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.707
<i>I have no idea what to expect.</i>

16:48.040 --> 16:50.510
I do my best for Germany.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.015
Go, Mexico!

17:14.601 --> 17:16.937
No, no pressure, just excitement.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.341
This level's going to be good, no?

17:21.407 --> 17:25.177
What motivates me to win,
and I know I will, is my family.

17:25.244 --> 17:28.915
<i>My dad used to compete as a bodybuilder.</i>

17:28.981 --> 17:31.183
<i>I always admired him a lot.</i>

17:32.652 --> 17:35.555
<i>He died when I was 11.</i>

17:35.889 --> 17:39.393
I try hard to be as good as he was,
or even better.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.688
-Way to go! It's yours!
-He got it down.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.856
Well done, Emmanuel.

18:15.629 --> 18:16.630
Come on, Mexico, come on!

18:59.139 --> 19:00.607
No!

19:11.584 --> 19:14.520
I'm too big, I got stuck
on my way out of the tube.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.455
I'm a bit tired.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.293
A lot of adrenaline, eh? All right.

19:47.888 --> 19:52.359
Good call. She changed her positioning.
Way to use your head, Maki!

19:52.425 --> 19:54.760
Oh, no! She went down again!

20:11.278 --> 20:13.146
Oh, no! She went down again!

20:32.565 --> 20:36.035
<i>In high school,</i>
<i>I weighed 225 pounds.</i>

20:36.102 --> 20:41.207
The doctor told me to change my habits
or I wouldn't live to be 30.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.876
<i>First, I started with a nutritionist</i>
<i>and lost the weight.</i>

20:43.943 --> 20:46.278
<i>Then I continued on my own,</i>

20:46.345 --> 20:49.181
but it's been
a process of trial and error.

20:50.017 --> 20:51.985
<i>I came here ready to defeat the Beast.</i>

20:52.052 --> 20:55.189
I'll be the Ultimate Beastmaster!

21:13.273 --> 21:15.609
Congratulations! Way to go!

21:15.676 --> 21:18.278
-Twenty points in!
-Mexico!

21:57.183 --> 22:04.123
-Fernando Casanova! Go! Go!
-Go!

22:20.472 --> 22:22.107
I lost those extra points.

22:22.741 --> 22:25.344
Let's hope for good numbers
and a pass to the third one.

22:59.146 --> 23:00.647
Marcel!

23:10.723 --> 23:13.025
He was taking too long, man.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.828
He was taking too long.

24:10.449 --> 24:16.155
-Germany!
-Germany!

24:31.171 --> 24:33.073
-He is celebrating himself.
-That's right!

24:48.322 --> 24:52.659
Does he know
that this is <i>Ultimate Beastmaster?</i>

24:52.726 --> 24:55.462
Joel Pusinzky, I think we'll close up

24:55.529 --> 24:57.464
and just leave him on the platform.

25:02.601 --> 25:05.671
Joel Pusinzky, this will not be enough,
but this is for you, brother.

25:45.779 --> 25:47.881
-Yes!
-There you go!

26:37.531 --> 26:40.934
It's way more difficult than Level 1.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.627
Way to go, Korea!

30:12.513 --> 30:15.482
I'm excited to be with another Mexican.

30:15.549 --> 30:18.752
And what a Mexican, right?
Fernando Casanova himself.

30:19.217 --> 30:23.255
To be with this youngster,
a brutal baby...

30:23.323 --> 30:25.225
-Yeah, baby, right.
-A great athlete.

30:25.292 --> 30:26.760
-We'll win this.
-That's right.

30:26.827 --> 30:28.495
A Mexican final.

30:35.903 --> 30:38.071
Go, Mexico!

32:51.772 --> 32:54.608
Mexico! Mexico! Mexico!

32:55.273 --> 32:57.709
Mexico!

33:07.521 --> 33:08.789
What was that, brother?

33:08.854 --> 33:12.090
-Such a warm-up, and then suddenly...
-He was too confident.

33:45.292 --> 33:47.728
-Jump, come on!
-Grab it, Emmanuel!

33:47.794 --> 33:49.296
Emmanuel...

33:53.667 --> 33:56.236
He did grab it, he saw it!

36:26.353 --> 36:29.823
-Come on, Emmanuel!
-There he goes, look!

36:29.890 --> 36:32.759
He pulled his legs up
so they wouldn't hit the floor.

36:32.826 --> 36:35.896
And he just completed it! Forty points!

36:35.963 --> 36:37.197
Well done!

36:37.264 --> 36:39.733
Emmanuel, yeah!

36:43.036 --> 36:44.638
Why did I stop? Because...

36:44.705 --> 36:47.207
<i>I barely did the trapeze.</i>
<i>I didn't want to risk it.</i>

36:47.272 --> 36:49.174
<i>I'm happy with what I did.</i>

36:49.576 --> 36:51.111
Go, Mexico!

37:00.988 --> 37:02.556
-It's now!
-It's now!

37:02.623 --> 37:06.026
-This is our...
-This is our Marcel Scarpim!

37:19.206 --> 37:20.974
No, no, no, no!

37:39.157 --> 37:42.193
<i>I'm not having any doubts.</i>

37:42.262 --> 37:44.932
I'm going to go and give it my all.

37:59.713 --> 38:02.316
I'm a proud man, I don't like losing.

38:02.781 --> 38:06.050
I'm winning, I'm dominating you,
you'll be mine, okay?

38:06.119 --> 38:07.721
-Go, Mexico!
-Well done!

38:07.788 --> 38:09.223
You're not defeating me.

38:17.364 --> 38:19.867
I'll be the Ultimate Beastmaster!

39:53.527 --> 39:55.996
You're so close, almost there!

39:56.063 --> 39:58.098
-My man, so close!
-Yeah, well done!

40:30.898 --> 40:33.133
Come on, Mexico, come on!

41:12.439 --> 41:15.843
What a shame, dear God!
