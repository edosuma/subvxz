Looks medical.

02:34.500 --> 02:38.300
Oh, right. Good.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.300
- So what do ya got?
- Mini epidemic here in L.A.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.400
Eleven children between
the ages of five and eight...

02:43.400 --> 02:45.800
hospitalized due to collapse
over the last three weeks.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.700
None of them have woken up.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.800
I'm working under the assumption
that this thing is mystical in nature.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.600
Why's that?

02:53.600 --> 02:57.000
Right.
Could be TheJoker.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.800
From the comic books?

03:00.800 --> 03:03.000
Just tryin' to think
outside the box.

03:08.100 --> 03:12.800
<i>I know Valentine's was last week, but, um,</i>
<i>I didn't take the discount on the card.</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:18.300
Thanks. Um,
we talked about this.

03:18.300 --> 03:22.700
I was thinking maybe
we could talk about it again.

03:22.700 --> 03:27.500
[Sighs]
I'm sorry, Knox, but you have work to do.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.100
I do.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.500
Back for the Wolfram and Hart
Bed and Breakfast?

03:52.500 --> 03:56.300
Full moon cycle starts tonight.
In 38 minutes, actually.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.300
Had a little snag
getting out of the house.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.100
- Haven't told your sister yet?
- Not the sort of thing
that's easy to jump to in conversation.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.000
"Oh, by the way, Jill,
I've been a werewolf for four months."

04:05.000 --> 04:07.500
I told her I was going camping
in the desert again.

04:07.500 --> 04:12.200
She's starting to worry I've turned into
some New Agey, moon-worshipping Wicca person.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.300
Might be relieved to find out
you're just a werewolf.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.800
- Hey there, Nina. We've got your suite ready.
- It's okay, Harmony.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.899
- I'll take her.
- Bye.

04:18.899 --> 04:22.600
<i>Harmony, did you get a receipt</i>
<i>from the county clerk...</i>

04:22.600 --> 04:25.100
on that filing I did
for the Wayburn case?

04:25.100 --> 04:28.500
Oh, yeah. Clerk's office called,
said you filed the wrong papers.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
- What?
- Yeah.

04:30.500 --> 04:35.300
You sent them a motion for change of venue
instead of a motion to dismiss.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.800
Unless you meant to do that...

04:37.800 --> 04:40.500
some kind of tricky lawyer maneuvering
you're trying to pull.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.800
- That it?
- Yeah. Keep 'em on their toes.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.300
Seems like you're gettin' used
to the routine though.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.300
Yeah. In a weird way,
I'm starting to like it.

04:53.300 --> 04:58.200
These stay-overs, I mean. Not the going
all hairy part, but... I don't know... coming here.

04:58.200 --> 05:03.300
There's always something interesting
going on... and getting to see you.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.700
<i>I look forward to that... you.</i>

05:06.700 --> 05:11.700
- All month, actually.
- Uh, um, I should probably close the cage.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.700
What?

05:13.700 --> 05:17.000
- Insurance thing.
- Oh, right.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.900
Okay. Um, bye.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.800
Anyway, I was thinking...

05:22.800 --> 05:26.200
I mean, what are you doing
for breakfast tomorrow?

05:27.600 --> 05:30.500
Oh, you know...
drinkin' blood.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.100
Right. Yeah.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.600
Uh, see ya.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.300
<i>- [Angel] She asked me to breakfast.</i>
- Breakfast?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.400
Right.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.700
How did you respond?

05:45.700 --> 05:50.300
Well, of course, I... [Clears Throat]
Ignored it completely...

05:50.300 --> 05:53.500
changed the subject
and locked her in a cage.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.400
- Sorry. What?
- Wes, it wasn't just breakfast.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.800
You know, it was...
<i>breakfast.</i>

05:59.800 --> 06:04.400
We had this very good, platonic thing goin' on,
and then all of a sudden, out of the blue...

06:04.400 --> 06:08.000
Are you blind?
Angel, there are things called signals.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.500
Odorless, yes. Invisible, certainly.
But unmistakable.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.400
- Like the ones she's been
casting your way for months.
- No. I would've noticed.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.300
This isn't just from me.
This comes from people who know.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.600
- This comes from the ladies.
- The ladies?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.400
Fred, Harmony,
the girls in transcription.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.200
<i>As Harmony put it,</i>
<i>"Why else would a chick...</i>

06:27.500 --> 06:31.500
who's coming to spend three nights
in a jail cell dress like it's her first date?"

06:31.500 --> 06:35.500
Oh, God.
The ladies are right.

06:35.500 --> 06:40.100
Nina's down there right now
turning into a werewolf and liking me.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.800
I don't... I can't...
I have no time for that kind of...

06:43.800 --> 06:47.200
I have no right. I mean, look.
We all know what happens if...

06:47.200 --> 06:51.600
If what? If you achieve a moment
of perfect happiness?

06:51.600 --> 06:54.000
- I turn back into Angelus, and we don't want that.
- [Scoffs]

06:54.000 --> 06:59.100
- What?
- 99.999 ad infinitum percent...

06:59.100 --> 07:01.900
of the best relationships
in the recorded history of the world...

07:01.900 --> 07:04.500
have had to make do
with acceptable happiness.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.200
- Look, Wes...
- Hiding behind your gypsy curse
when there's a beautiful...

07:07.200 --> 07:11.100
<i>engaging... all right,</i>
<i>occasionally hirsute... young woman...</i>

07:11.400 --> 07:13.300
who actually wants you?

07:13.300 --> 07:16.700
- Wes, it's not gonna happen.
- Why?
- Because I'm not that guy.

07:16.700 --> 07:21.500
That guy is charming
and funny and... emotionally useful.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.900
I'm the guy in the dark corner with the blood habit
and the 200 years of psychic baggage.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.100
- Get over it!
- Why are you yelling at me?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.700
Because!

07:30.700 --> 07:36.200
Angel, if there's a woman out there...

07:36.200 --> 07:38.900
who you find truly attractive...

07:38.900 --> 07:43.800
who you think about,
let's say, most of the time...

07:43.800 --> 07:48.100
who represents even part of what you think
makes the world worth fighting for...

07:48.100 --> 07:50.400
and who doesn't view you...

07:50.400 --> 07:54.700
as an entirely sexless shoulder
to lean on...

07:54.700 --> 07:58.400
you have to do something
about it.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.500
- Who are we talkin' about here?
- Fred.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.900
Hey, guys.
Uh, I think I have a case.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.400
- [In Unison] Thank God.
- A children's epidemic. Seven kids comatose...

08:10.400 --> 08:12.800
each with a semi-rictus
of the facial muscles.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.200
- I haven't been able to isolate a causative agent.
- You think it's mystical?

08:16.200 --> 08:20.800
Well, I've been down the strictly physiological
route, number-crunched victims' charts...

08:20.800 --> 08:23.800
even had our hospital contacts
send over blood samples.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.600
I've pulled their plasma apart. No indicators
on the cellular or subcellular levels.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.300
- TV.
- What?

08:30.300 --> 08:33.700
Parents said all the kids
collapsed between 7:00 and...

08:33.700 --> 08:36.500
it looks like 7:30 a.m.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.900
- And all of them in front of the TV.
- Hmm.

08:38.900 --> 08:43.299
That could be something. But I'd still
like to get a handle on the pathology.

08:43.299 --> 08:46.500
Good. I'll follow up on this lead.
I'll need to clear my schedule.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.200
These kids need help.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.600
[Chuckles]
Wow. He really jumped on that one.

08:52.600 --> 08:58.200
Yes. He is a bit jumpy.
He's realized Nina has feelings for him.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.100
- Well, it took long enough.
- He can be rather dense.

09:02.900 --> 09:06.900
Um, by the way,
my car is in the shop again...

09:07.100 --> 09:09.800
- and I was thinking...
- Of course.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.700
Maybe you and I,
we could...

09:12.700 --> 09:15.300
Yes. Miss Burkle needs a driver
to take her home tonight.

09:15.300 --> 09:19.900
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>511 Windward Circle.</i>

09:19.900 --> 09:22.900
<i>[Lorne] All the signals are there,</i>
<i>jefe, loud and clear.</i>

09:22.900 --> 09:27.900
- Nina definitely wants a piece of Angelcake.
- Can we get back to the job?

09:27.900 --> 09:30.200
Your wish, dreamboat,
my command.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.000
- [Groans]
<i>- I know most of the show runners</i>
<i>in town, and none of them...</i>

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000

of big-league, sinister...

09:37.100 --> 09:40.200
Hey. [Chuckles]
7:00 to 7:30?

09:40.200 --> 09:43.800
- Yeah.
- That'd be funny.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.000
- You know, if it wasn't.
- What?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.400
Real popular kids' show

09:48.400 --> 09:52.900

<i>the right demographic.</i>

- [Angel] Uh, Fred?
- Oh, hi, Angel.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.800
- About the epidemic. It might
not be mystical after all.
- Do you think you could...

13:16.800 --> 13:20.000
Knox found a systematic endocrine dysfunction
common with all the children...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.300
<i>- similar to the effects of</i>
<i>an obscure rain forest pathogen,</i>
- Fred?

13:22.300 --> 13:24.400
So I put a call in
to the C.D.C., and...

13:24.400 --> 13:28.100
Fred! Believe me,
it's mystical.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.800
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>

13:30.800 --> 13:33.600

13:33.600 --> 13:37.200
<i>- [Wesley] Yes. Is there a problem?</i>
<i>- Oh, there's a problem.</i>

13:39.500 --> 13:42.000
Whoa.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.600
Angel? Is that you?

13:45.600 --> 13:48.900
Oh, my God!
Angel, you're...

13:48.900 --> 13:50.900
cute.

13:50.900 --> 13:55.200

- Oh, but the little hands! And the hair.

Hey! You're fired.

What's with the big... puppet?

14:02.200 --> 14:05.500
- [Groaning]
- Angel, what happened?

14:05.500 --> 14:08.800
I'm not sure. I went over
to <i>Smile Time</i> last night.

14:08.800 --> 14:13.400
I think their office is under some kind
of spell. I could feel it trying to get at me.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.000
I shook it off, but then I met this guy
with a towel over his head...

14:17.000 --> 14:19.500
and something exploded.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.900
I woke up like this.

14:22.900 --> 14:26.100
Clearly some sort of hex...

14:26.100 --> 14:29.800
<i>or a powerful warding magic.</i>

14:29.800 --> 14:33.600
<i>- Maybe you have some type of puppet cancer.</i>
- I do not have puppet cancer!

14:33.900 --> 14:38.700
Come on, guys. This is serious.
I'm a puppet, and there are children's lives at...

<i>This transformation may have</i>

<i>and mean old Mr. Fish-and-Chips</i>
<i>said that Polo won't win the race tomorrow...</i>

And if you're losing it,
well, they wanted that too.

28:18.500 --> 28:22.900
- Why would they do that?
- [Chuckles] You never know with them.

28:22.900 --> 28:26.400
I can't lose this...
this power, these skills.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.700
- They've changed me, given me...
- Meaning?

28:30.700 --> 28:34.500
And to have it taken away...
It's heartbreaking.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.100
Though I do think Cliff Robertson captured
the poignance of it more elegantly.

28:38.100 --> 28:42.700
- I'm not goin' back to who I was.
- Well, maybe, maybe not.

28:45.300 --> 28:50.100
See, I, uh... I always have
a few things going on the side.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.400
- [Machine Beeping]
- Currently I have a lot...

28:52.400 --> 28:55.500
of capital sunk into a shipment
that's being held up at Customs.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.800
- Drugs?
- [Chuckles] Goodness, no. I make my own drugs.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.700
No. Just an ancient curio...
a collectible I hope to turn a profit on.

29:02.700 --> 29:07.100
If I was to give you
the permanent upgrade...

29:07.100 --> 29:10.600
I'd say that you'd be more than able
to cut through all of my red tape problems.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.300
I don't make deals
with people like you.

29:12.300 --> 29:15.100
Believe me, Charles.
I don't make deals with people like <i>you.</i>

29:15.100 --> 29:19.100
Not the person you really are...
the ignorant street muscle.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.400
<i>The high school dropout.</i>
<i>I would, however...</i>

29:22.400 --> 29:26.200
Iove to make a deal
with Charles Gunn, attorney at law.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.500
And now it's time
for Action Math News...

29:32.500 --> 29:37.400
with your Action Math experts,
Ratio Hornblower and Groofus.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.100
[Ratio Whooping]

29:40.100 --> 29:44.000
Thank you, Polo.
Our top story this morning.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.800
Two plus two is four.

29:46.800 --> 29:52.000
And in related news,
four plus four is eight!

29:52.000 --> 29:55.500
It could be
the lack of sleep talking, but...

29:55.500 --> 29:57.900
I'm really starting
to like this show.

29:57.900 --> 30:02.400
I know what you mean.
What time is it?

30:02.400 --> 30:05.800
4:00 a.m. And counting.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.500
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want...
- Ah, it's all right.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.200
<i>- 'Cause I could...</i>
- No. Really.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.500
All right.
What are we missing?

30:15.500 --> 30:18.700
I guess we should go back and comb
through the signal spread...

30:18.700 --> 30:20.900
- check all the tracks again.
- [Monitor Beeping]

30:20.900 --> 30:25.900
Again? What's up with you two? The tracks are
clear. We ran it through every filter we've got.

30:25.900 --> 30:29.700
- That's not how magic works, Knox.
- Really, Merlin?

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
- Then how does magic work?
- You know what? I think
we can handle it from here.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.800
- You should go home, Knox, get some rest.
- I don't want to abandon ship.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.500
It's okay. Somebody's gotta be awake enough
to run the lab tomorrow.

30:41.500 --> 30:45.800
- Seriously. Go home.
- Okay.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.000
<i>[TV: Characters Singing,</i>
<i>Indistinct]</i>

30:48.000 --> 30:50.900
<i>[Fred]</i>
<i>I love this one.</i>

30:53.500 --> 30:57.100
And even in the length
of a yo-yo string

30:57.100 --> 31:01.100
<i>There's a little bit</i>
<i>of math in everything</i>

31:01.100 --> 31:04.700
One plus one is two
and two plus two is four

31:04.700 --> 31:07.600
So how's it going
with you and Knox?

31:07.600 --> 31:11.000
- I know you were starting to...
- Started and stopped, actually.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
- Really?
- Yeah. We went out a few times...

31:16.000 --> 31:18.100
but I don't know...

31:18.100 --> 31:21.100
- [TV Clicks Off]
- So you stopped it?

31:21.100 --> 31:24.700
Yeah. He...
He's nice enough, but...

31:24.700 --> 31:27.200
I think he's been
working here too long.

31:27.200 --> 31:31.000
Plus, he doesn't make me laugh at all.
I mean, he tries, but...

31:31.300 --> 31:34.500
I see. You're looking
for someone funny.

31:34.500 --> 31:39.000
<i>- [Keyboard Keys Clacking]</i>
- A certain kind of funny, yeah.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.800
But I'm not really looking for
so much as looking at...

31:44.800 --> 31:48.400
Hang on.
Go back a second.

31:48.400 --> 31:52.200
- [Machine Whirring]
- There's something different.
Maybe if we bring up the volume.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.300
To the arc of a swing

31:55.300 --> 31:58.100
- And even in the length
- [No Audible Dialogue]

31:58.100 --> 32:01.900
Polo isn't singing
with the rest of them.

32:01.900 --> 32:04.900
<i>- It looks like he's talking to the audience.</i>
<i>- [Wesley] Yes.</i>

32:04.900 --> 32:07.900
<i>When the song is playing,</i>
<i>it acts as a sort of cloaking spell...</i>

32:07.900 --> 32:12.600
allowing Framkin to address his target
without being seen by the rest of his viewers.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.300
- So that's how he's been hiding it.
- That's how he <i>was</i> hiding it.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.700
[Grunting]
Stupid fingers.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.600
Stupid string.
[Grunts]

32:27.600 --> 32:32.000
It's all in the broadcast. Some very
nuanced magic, but we found it... finally.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.100
- Angel, what happened?
- Uh, nothing.

32:35.100 --> 32:38.400
It's not important.
Just doesn't matter.

32:38.400 --> 32:42.400
- Go on.
- It's a hidden carrier wave masked by a spell...

32:42.400 --> 32:45.900
that turns the TV into a two-way conduit
with direct access to the viewer.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.000
<i>[Wesley] That's how he's been</i>
<i>draining energy from the children.</i>

32:48.000 --> 32:50.600
And judging from the strength
of yesterday's signal...

32:50.600 --> 32:54.600
- Framkin's ready to take out the whole audience.
<i>- The object you described...</i>

32:54.700 --> 32:58.500
in that secret room is most likely
a repository for the children's life force.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.600
We'll have to
break the binding magic on it.

33:00.600 --> 33:05.300
Which should free those children
and reverse your puppet problem.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.100
[Joyous Gasping]
I love you guys.

33:08.100 --> 33:10.600
[Panting]

33:10.600 --> 33:14.200
Oh. [Clears Throat]
We'd better get moving.

33:14.200 --> 33:19.800
Framkin knows we're onto him. If he's ready
to zap his audience, he'll pull the trigger today.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.900
- Not him. Them.
- Gunn?

33:21.900 --> 33:24.700
<i>Framkin's not doin'this.</i>
<i>It's the puppets. They're demons.</i>

33:24.700 --> 33:28.000
The show is possessed <i>. Smile Time's</i> ratings
hit an all-time low last year.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.800
Framkin made a deal with some devils
to bring it back to number one.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.000
- You sure of that?
- Dead sure. Every contract signed...

33:33.000 --> 33:36.300
with the lower planes is filed
in the Library of Demonic Congress.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.800
You just gotta know where to look.
Pretty tricky legalese too.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.900
Framkin must have missed some
of the fine print.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.700
- Which allowed them to take over everything.
<i>- Including Framkin.</i>

33:46.000 --> 33:48.100
These particular devils
have a fairly distinctive M.O.

33:48.100 --> 33:52.100
- They've done this before?
- You seen the last few seasons of <i>Happy Days?</i>

33:52.100 --> 33:55.700
Point is, you wanna take out <i>Smile Time,</i>
take out the puppets.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.600
Well, then...
