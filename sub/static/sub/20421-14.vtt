00:02.780 --> 00:04.660
Huh, that's strange...

00:04.660 --> 00:06.960
This is even more amazing 
than your room, my lord.

00:04.660 --> 00:07.400
Where did they go? 
I was certain they were here...

00:08.170 --> 00:09.890
I'm terribly sorry.

00:09.890 --> 00:14.090
I could've sworn I had potions 
to drink somewhere.

00:14.090 --> 00:15.220
It's fine.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.020
Help yourself.

00:26.030 --> 00:31.050
By the way, isn't that Dazaneg's magic bag?

00:31.050 --> 00:35.780
I believe making one requires a purple flame 
crystal and a winged dragon skin.

00:36.050 --> 00:37.010
Yes.

00:37.570 --> 00:41.230
I got the items, and I had 
someone make it for me.

00:42.570 --> 00:49.930
<i>He knows the requirements for the 
level-45 quest "Get the Magic Bag."</i>

00:50.820 --> 00:52.520
<i>Who is he?</i>

02:24.300 --> 02:26.090
Tomorrow, we'll go in the afternoon, too.

02:26.090 --> 02:27.000
Right...

02:27.360 --> 02:31.070
An hour's rest will restore our 
HP and MP back to max.

02:31.070 --> 02:32.030
Yes.

02:32.030 --> 02:36.420
But you're only allowed to enter 
a dungeon once per day...

02:36.650 --> 02:38.100
That's exactly right.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.550
Master Naotsugu!

02:40.930 --> 02:43.930
If you can't follow the rules, 
you'll have to go back to Akihabara.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.500
But...

02:45.500 --> 02:49.460
Adventurers should follow the rules.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.190
Part of your job is ensuring you get enough rest.

02:57.420 --> 03:03.330
<b>World Fraction</b>

02:59.830 --> 03:01.090
World Fraction.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.540
I'm sorry...

03:05.540 --> 03:08.250
Back there, I called myself a mage,

03:08.250 --> 03:11.250
but I am, more precisely, a magical scientist.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.420
I the magician of Miral Lake,

03:17.260 --> 03:18.630
Regan.

03:19.810 --> 03:21.130
Miral Lake?

03:21.790 --> 03:24.940
Are you saying you're the sage of Miral Lake?

03:24.940 --> 03:26.640
Do you know of him, master?

03:26.880 --> 03:27.640
Yeah.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.850
When this was a game,

03:28.850 --> 03:32.150
I heard the name in several 
quests and town rumors.

03:32.690 --> 03:37.980
For example, the key item for the 
"Nine Dungeons of the Heilos" raid,

03:37.980 --> 03:42.160
the Key of Eternal Darkness, was said to 
have been made by Mirallake the Sage.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.750
I thought the name was just flavor text 
for the game's item descriptions,

03:47.750 --> 03:52.170
something that only existed as backstory 
to give the game more depth.

03:52.430 --> 03:58.420
Although, since taking the name from 
my master, I've never used it.

03:58.850 --> 04:02.220
"Sage of Miral Lake" is a hereditary title?

04:02.220 --> 04:02.940
Yes.

04:03.790 --> 04:06.490
<i>Seems I've run across someone very important.</i>

04:07.410 --> 04:10.530
<i>This may be my chance to learn about this world.</i>

04:11.210 --> 04:14.590
There are many different types of magic,

04:14.590 --> 04:16.440
dealing in a wide range of areas.

04:16.980 --> 04:22.450
I specialize in the study of world-class magic.

04:22.670 --> 04:25.500
World-class? I'm not familiar with it.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.160
A school of thought divides magic 
according to its scale...

04:29.160 --> 04:30.060
Action-class magic,

04:29.160 --> 04:30.060
<b>Action-class Magic</b>

04:30.060 --> 04:31.260
combat-class magic,

04:30.330 --> 04:31.580
<b>Combat-class Magic</b>

04:31.260 --> 04:32.620
operation-class magic,

04:31.580 --> 04:32.830
<b>Operation-class Magic</b>

04:32.620 --> 04:33.810
tactical-class magic,

04:32.830 --> 04:33.540
<b>Tactical-class Magic</b>

04:33.810 --> 04:35.050
strategy-class magic,

04:34.080 --> 04:35.330
<b>Strategy-class Magic</b>

04:35.050 --> 04:36.310
national defense-class magic,

04:35.330 --> 04:36.540
<b>National Defense-class Magic</b>

04:36.310 --> 04:37.710
continent-class magic,

04:36.540 --> 04:37.710
<b>Continent-class Magic</b>

04:37.920 --> 04:38.920
and...

04:39.500 --> 04:40.710
<b>World-class Magic</b>

04:39.560 --> 04:40.710
world-class magic.

04:40.710 --> 04:43.620
Isn't magic usually divided by type?

04:43.620 --> 04:48.410
Division by scale considers magic from 
a phenomenological perspective,

04:48.410 --> 04:53.200
or in conjunction with its intended objective.

04:53.640 --> 04:59.730
<b>Action-class Magic</b>

04:53.910 --> 04:59.380
"Action-class" refers to magic capable 
of replicating a single action.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.470
For example, swinging a sword 
and fighting a monster...

05:03.080 --> 05:05.990
If you do that with magic, it's "action-class."

05:05.990 --> 05:11.410
<b>Combat-class Magic</b>

05:06.370 --> 05:11.410
Combat-class magic is capable of altering 
the course of a single battle.

05:12.030 --> 05:12.950
For example,

05:12.950 --> 05:18.420
a spell capable of deciding the fate 
of a platoon of enemies or allies.

05:18.760 --> 05:24.520
Operation-class magic can decide 
two or three battles at a time.

05:25.380 --> 05:33.100
<b>Tactical-class Magic</b>

05:25.610 --> 05:27.740
Tactical goes one step further.

05:27.740 --> 05:32.180
Perhaps a spell capable of conquering 
an enemy castle with a single hit.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.610
Does that mean it could also destroy a dungeon?

05:37.700 --> 05:41.980
<i>There wasn't any magic of 
that scale in the game.</i>

05:42.620 --> 05:46.990
Strategic-class would be a single spell 
deciding the outcome of a war.

05:47.340 --> 05:49.620
National defense, a nation.

05:49.870 --> 05:52.490
Continent-class, a continent.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.120
And thus, world-class...

05:55.580 --> 06:00.220
A spell capable of controlling the laws, 
the fate, or the very existence

06:00.220 --> 06:01.650
of an entire world?

06:02.180 --> 06:03.630
Indeed.

06:07.370 --> 06:09.520
I understand the concept,

06:09.520 --> 06:12.240
but does such magic exist?

06:13.720 --> 06:18.560
To my knowledge, it has been 
used at least three times.

06:19.270 --> 06:25.810
<b>World Fraction</b>

06:19.390 --> 06:25.150
A spell called "World Fraction."

06:27.160 --> 06:29.070
The Apocalypse, yes?

06:30.960 --> 06:34.230
I invited you here because I hoped

06:34.230 --> 06:38.500
to hear the information you 
know about this matter.

06:39.010 --> 06:41.920
Then I'd like to ask you, as well.

06:43.050 --> 06:47.010
We know next to nothing about the Apocalypse.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.700
We need information.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.270
I would be happy to tell you anything I know.

06:53.270 --> 06:56.160
Then would you begin by telling us

06:56.160 --> 07:00.650
about the first and second times 
World Fraction was used?

07:00.960 --> 07:02.850
The story will take some time to tell.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.150
Is that all right?

07:04.450 --> 07:05.440
That's fine.

07:05.890 --> 07:09.350
Then I will begin with the older story.

07:14.450 --> 07:18.980
<i>Formation... Operator... Field monitor...</i>

07:19.410 --> 07:20.950
<i>Patrol file...</i>

07:21.840 --> 07:22.860
<i>Right?</i>

07:24.130 --> 07:27.710
<i>I remember everything Shiroe taught 
me about fighting in a party.</i>

07:28.860 --> 07:32.070
<i>But why am I so uneasy?</i>

07:33.320 --> 07:36.450
<i>Am I missing something?</i>

07:37.560 --> 07:40.230
Approximately three hundred and fifty years ago,

07:40.620 --> 07:44.260
the world is said to have been a far 
more prosperous place than today.

07:45.630 --> 07:51.070
It was a pale shadow of the age of gods, 
which has passed into legend.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.020
But during that time,

07:53.020 --> 07:57.170
humans, elves, dwarves, and alvs...

07:57.170 --> 07:59.680
These four races lived together.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.500
The alvs, in particular, were magical inventors,

08:03.830 --> 08:07.200
and the vanguard of a vast magical civilization.

08:07.740 --> 08:11.560
However, that power became their undoing.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.880
What do you mean?

08:13.260 --> 08:16.230
As a race, their reproductive 
capacity was quite slim,

08:16.230 --> 08:18.140
and their nation was small.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.200
They were despised for their monopoly 
over magical technology,

08:22.200 --> 08:26.740
so the other races used their 
superior numbers to destroy them.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.040
Then what about me?

08:29.040 --> 08:30.900
I'm a half-alv.

08:31.330 --> 08:35.900
Throughout the world, 
the alvs were treated as slaves.

08:36.370 --> 08:39.410
Their descendants are the half-alvs.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.770
In any event, the alv kingdom was destroyed.

08:44.300 --> 08:49.670
And then, the six bent princesses, 
the Luquenje, were born.

08:49.920 --> 08:56.180
<b>Luquenje</b>

08:50.330 --> 08:51.890
Six bent princess?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.370
Luquenje?

08:53.950 --> 08:56.180
The six bent princesses.

08:56.940 --> 09:01.770
The six didn't know each other, and 
they certainly weren't acting in concert.

09:02.260 --> 09:05.610
Nonetheless, each of these six alv women

09:05.610 --> 09:08.670
swore revenge independently, yet simultaneously.

09:10.230 --> 09:13.190
Some seduced those in power.

09:13.190 --> 09:16.570
Some led the remaining alvs.

09:18.820 --> 09:22.490
And the world was plunged into chaos once more.

09:23.120 --> 09:27.290
But in the end, all six were left 
on the verge of defeat.

09:27.710 --> 09:33.090
And it was then that the first 
World Fraction was used.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.340
By the alvs?

09:36.740 --> 09:38.080
Indeed.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.940
But the technologies and principles used 
remain deeply shrouded in mystery.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.850
And the spell brought about the birth of

09:46.980 --> 09:48.770
the demi-humans.

09:49.910 --> 09:53.410
Until three hundred years ago, 
there were no demi-humans.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.360
As to how they were created...

09:56.820 --> 10:01.370
Repeated war had decreased the population,

10:01.370 --> 10:04.030
leaving the planet overrun with souls.

10:09.310 --> 10:13.420
These souls were used, it seems, 
in the creation of the demi-humans.

10:14.140 --> 10:17.320
The wars with the demi-humans 
pushed humanity to the brink,

10:17.320 --> 10:20.620
and the world entered a dark age.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.780
Humanity defeated the Luquenje,

10:24.780 --> 10:28.810
but there is no doubt their revenge succeeded.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.980
To counter the demi-humans,

10:32.980 --> 10:37.420
humanity used alv secrets to create new races...

10:37.420 --> 10:45.190
The cat people, the wolf fangs, 
the fox tails, and the robed ones.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.860
<b>Wolf Fangs 

Cat People</b>

10:39.860 --> 10:41.280
<b>Fox Tails 

Wolf Fangs</b>

10:41.280 --> 10:44.580
<b>Robed Ones 

Fox Tails 

Wolf Fangs</b>

10:44.580 --> 10:45.580
<b>Robed Ones 

Fox Tails</b>

10:46.020 --> 10:49.290
It seems the precursors were 
created then, as well.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.880
<i>The precursors are</i>

10:51.880 --> 10:56.970
<i>among the most powerful non-player characters, 
with strength rivaling that of adventurers.</i>

10:57.630 --> 11:03.560
<i>Within the game's story, they're 
regarded as legendary heroes.</i>

11:04.140 --> 11:07.750
We can discuss the precursors another time.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.420
For now, I will simply say it is the souls,

11:08.310 --> 11:13.980
<b>Spirit Theory</b>

11:10.420 --> 11:13.980
an issue of Spirit Theory, that interests us.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.180
Spirit Theory?

11:16.180 --> 11:21.490
Even so, humanity was incapable of 
halting its slide toward the abyss.

11:21.860 --> 11:26.520
No matter how many demi-humans one 
defeated, they simply reincarnated.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.500
Which meant there was no way to defeat them.

11:30.010 --> 11:32.220
<i>Is he talking about respawns?</i>

11:32.710 --> 11:35.000
<i>I thought that was part of the game.</i>

11:35.670 --> 11:40.560
<i>If players in the game wipe out 
all monsters within a zone,</i>

11:40.560 --> 11:43.030
<i>there'd be nothing left for other players.</i>

11:43.560 --> 11:47.630
<i>Thus, after a certain amount of time, 
monsters always reappear</i>

11:47.630 --> 11:49.770
<i>in a process called respawning.</i>

11:50.090 --> 11:53.080
Sixty years after the first World Fraction,

11:53.650 --> 11:58.510
humanity had fallen nearly completely to 
the endless wars with demi-humans.

11:59.220 --> 12:02.720
And then, a divine summoning spell was used,

12:02.720 --> 12:05.530
and messengers of God appeared.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.160
This was two hundred and forty years ago.

12:12.140 --> 12:15.110
The second World Fraction.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.520
The appearance of the adventurers.

12:21.820 --> 12:23.780
Two hundred and forty years...

12:25.060 --> 12:28.970
Come to think of it, why did you talk to me?

12:28.970 --> 12:30.330
What do you mean?

12:30.330 --> 12:32.940
There are other Round Table representatives...

12:33.320 --> 12:36.330
You are an archmage, you know.

12:36.330 --> 12:38.910
I thought you might have a better 
idea as to what's happening.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.940
An archmage?

12:41.210 --> 12:43.280
Is that true, my lord?

12:43.280 --> 12:44.700
I don't know...

12:44.900 --> 12:49.950
Your name first appeared in our 
history books ninety-eight years ago.

12:50.550 --> 12:55.710
The time you've been active alone 
is proof that you're an archmage.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.710
Ninety-eight years?

12:58.030 --> 13:00.520
You're that old, my lord?

13:00.520 --> 13:01.720
No, that's imposs—

13:02.190 --> 13:02.980
Wait...

13:03.440 --> 13:05.380
<i>In the</i> Elder Tale <i>game,</i>

13:05.380 --> 13:08.580
<i>time advanced at twelve times 
the rate of the real world.</i>

13:08.580 --> 13:13.450
<i>In other words, one day in the game 
equals two real world hours.</i>

13:14.980 --> 13:17.940
<i>Ninety-eight years ago, in this world,</i>

13:17.940 --> 13:21.260
<i>would be eight years and 
several months in ours.</i>

13:22.540 --> 13:25.030
<i>That's when I started playing</i> Elder Tale.

13:26.630 --> 13:30.150
<i>Two hundred and forty years ago, 
when adventurers first appeared in this world,</i>

13:30.150 --> 13:32.220
<i>would be twenty years in our world.</i>

13:32.780 --> 13:34.000
<i>That would align</i>

13:34.620 --> 13:39.060
<i>with the start of the open beta 
for the</i> Elder Tale <i>game.</i>

13:45.660 --> 13:49.510
Surprisingly few lords want troops.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.040
Yes.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.810
Most of them want technology sharing, 
or trade agreements.

13:54.810 --> 13:57.270
They knew all about the steam engine.

13:57.680 --> 14:01.240
We know they had spies in Akihabara.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.530
Knowing about it doesn't mean they'd 
be able to easily make one.

14:05.770 --> 14:09.180
Shiroe's right. It's nothing to worry over now.

14:09.530 --> 14:11.380
That's true, but...

14:15.280 --> 14:16.370
My lord?

14:18.360 --> 14:19.880
Are you thinking about yesterday?

14:20.490 --> 14:21.420
Yeah.

14:23.150 --> 14:26.050
What is this "Spirit Theory" you mentioned?

14:26.380 --> 14:30.990
The mystical energy that animates humans 
and demi-humans is called the "spirit."

14:30.390 --> 14:35.560
<b>Spirit</b>

14:31.440 --> 14:35.560
Spirit consists of two distinct 
energies, psyche and anima.

14:35.560 --> 14:41.310
<b>Psyche</b>

14:36.110 --> 14:38.850
Psyche is the energy that animates the mind.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.260
It affects things such as magic, as well.

14:41.650 --> 14:44.820
<b>Psyche = Magic Points</b>

14:41.930 --> 14:45.310
It is also called MP, magic points.

14:44.820 --> 14:47.900
<b>Anima</b>

14:45.970 --> 14:48.830
Anima is the energy that animates the body.

14:48.200 --> 14:54.330
<b>Anima = Hit Points</b>

14:48.830 --> 14:50.980
HP... Hit points.

14:50.980 --> 14:54.330
It is also the energy known as "ki."

14:54.860 --> 14:58.870
When someone is defeated in battle, 
they can no longer move,

14:58.870 --> 15:01.330
but the mind remains healthy.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.810
However, the anima and psyche are split,

15:04.810 --> 15:08.340
and the psyche is trapped in darkness.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.740
This is because the information 
that flows to the mind

15:11.740 --> 15:14.090
from the body, which senses light, 
has been cut off.

15:14.630 --> 15:18.300
Then the dispersal of the body, 
the anima, begins...

15:19.260 --> 15:22.110
This process is called anima-dispersal.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.110
<b>Anima-Dispersal</b>

15:22.810 --> 15:26.290
Resurrection magic is used 
on corpses in this state.

15:26.290 --> 15:31.110
The anima that has dispersed into 
the air is gathered and reconstructed.

15:31.870 --> 15:36.650
The information required for the reconstruction 
is derived by calculating backwards

15:36.650 --> 15:39.120
from the information left in the corpse.

15:39.690 --> 15:44.630
And the healer provides any missing energy.

15:45.180 --> 15:49.510
So information from before death 
cannot be perfectly restored.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.890
<b>Status Info 

You have lost 1,811,933 
EXP as a penalty.</b>

15:49.880 --> 15:53.890
<b>You have been resurrected.                                          Smash 
Race/ Wolf Fang 
Swashbuckler, Lv. 88 
Dread Pack</b>

15:50.670 --> 15:53.890
That's why, when you are revived, EXP is lost.

15:54.450 --> 15:57.390
You could say that information 
degradation is unavoidable.

15:57.780 --> 16:01.780
Naturally, if the body, the anima, 
disperses completely,

16:01.780 --> 16:03.820
resurrection becomes impossible.

16:04.270 --> 16:06.900
At this point, People of the Land die.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.650
But before that point...

16:10.040 --> 16:13.370
Resurrection magic will work 
on People of the Land, also.

16:13.810 --> 16:15.420
For an adventurer, though,

16:15.420 --> 16:17.690
once anima dispersal is complete,

16:17.690 --> 16:20.130
the body decomposes into particles.

16:20.130 --> 16:23.020
And the psyche, the mind, uses its power

16:23.020 --> 16:26.050
to transport the adventurer to the 
Cathedral, where they revive.

16:26.570 --> 16:30.670
This system is quite similar to 
that of the demi-humans.

16:30.670 --> 16:36.260
Of course, this is merely a hypothesis that 
my teacher and I were researching.

16:36.650 --> 16:40.980
Then, do demi-humans possess 
memories from before death?

16:40.980 --> 16:42.270
We don't know.

16:42.270 --> 16:47.820
<b>Consciousness    Personality    Memories 

 Psyche</b>

16:42.710 --> 16:44.740
An individual's personality and consciousness

16:44.740 --> 16:47.520
are stored inside the psyche as information.

16:47.820 --> 16:55.280
<b>Psyche                      Anima</b>

16:48.280 --> 16:52.870
Memories, however, are also stored within 
an organ of the body called the brain.

16:52.870 --> 16:55.280
The body, of course, being anima.

16:55.740 --> 16:59.920
So memories exist both within 
the anima and the psyche?

17:00.560 --> 17:04.890
Is that information damaged 
when the body is reconstructed?

17:04.890 --> 17:06.790
Yes, most likely.

17:07.500 --> 17:12.440
It's quite possible that memories are 
damaged or lost during death.

17:13.840 --> 17:20.560
The demi-human psyches were warped 
by the first World Fraction's curse.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.900
Even if their memories remain,

17:22.900 --> 17:26.560
they may not recognize those 
memories as their own.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.160
In other words, they may recall 
them as we would a story.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.430
<i>Does that mean we'll lose 
our memories, as well?</i>

17:36.570 --> 17:37.630
My lord?

17:41.580 --> 17:43.830
I don't understand any of it.

17:45.710 --> 17:49.340
If we die in this world, don't we simply revive?

17:52.280 --> 17:56.130
The person sitting at the computer, 
playing the game, is the mind.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.350
<b>Psyche</b>

17:56.840 --> 17:58.350
In other words, the psyche.

17:58.350 --> 18:08.340
<b>Psyche                      Anima</b>

17:59.140 --> 18:03.010
The character inside the screen 
is the body, the anima.

18:03.940 --> 18:06.060
Naturally, the player is the one with

18:06.060 --> 18:08.360
memories of what happened during the game.

18:08.360 --> 18:14.350
<b>Anima</b>

18:08.910 --> 18:13.840
But the player's character is the one 
with the EXP, level, and other data.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.920
Until now, if the character died,

18:16.920 --> 18:19.800
it only meant losing experience in a game.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.870
It wouldn't hurt us in the real world at all.

18:24.090 --> 18:30.470
But it's possible that now, our psyche 
and anima are united in one place.

18:30.950 --> 18:31.940
In other words...

18:32.420 --> 18:37.380
Our memories and the experience points 
our characters had have become one.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.550
If we die, we'll lose our memories,

18:41.550 --> 18:43.140
along with our experience points.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.100
I don't know how much we'd lose.

18:48.650 --> 18:53.330
Since we came to this world, 
many people have died,

18:53.330 --> 18:55.650
but I haven't heard anyone 
making a big deal about it.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.660
So it may be no more than a little forgetfulness.

19:01.070 --> 19:02.340
But even so...

19:03.640 --> 19:04.910
Even so,

19:04.910 --> 19:06.660
it isn't pleasant to contemplate.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.170
Forgetting about the real world...

19:11.390 --> 19:15.170
Anyway, we won't tell anyone 
about this for a while.

19:15.860 --> 19:16.760
Got it?

19:17.480 --> 19:18.430
Yeah.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.040
Good morning...

19:24.040 --> 19:25.600
Good morning.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.670
You're up early.

19:27.670 --> 19:30.060
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

19:30.060 --> 19:31.510
Me, either.

19:31.910 --> 19:34.070
I wonder if it'll go well today.

19:38.370 --> 19:40.500
I'll go take a quick bath!

19:41.440 --> 19:42.660
See you.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.760
Tohya, good morning.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.580
Mm.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.020
Those are...

20:11.980 --> 20:14.020
Dungeon corridors?

20:14.690 --> 20:16.820
He's practicing.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.320
S-Sorry...

20:21.810 --> 20:23.520
Hey, Miss Isuzu.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.330
Splendid morning, isn't it?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.570
You don't need to force yourself.

20:28.570 --> 20:30.470
What are you talking about?!

20:30.470 --> 20:34.620
I was just taking a morning walk, 
invited by the forest nymphs,

20:34.620 --> 20:36.840
to listen to the birds' harmony...

20:37.250 --> 20:38.120
Yeah.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.160
R-Really?

20:40.160 --> 20:43.190
So what are you doing, Miss Isuzu?

20:43.190 --> 20:45.130
I'm going for a bath.

20:45.130 --> 20:48.100
Oh, I know! Why not come with me, Rundel Haus?

20:48.100 --> 20:49.350
B-Bath?

20:49.980 --> 20:53.460
I'm not interested in peeking at bathing ladies!

20:53.460 --> 20:55.310
Please don't insult me...

20:55.310 --> 20:57.860
No one said anything about taking one together.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.640
You wouldn't want a lady walking 
through the forest alone, right?

21:02.640 --> 21:04.090
Oh, I see.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.870
That's true...

21:06.170 --> 21:08.310
Yes, your escort, then.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.120
I would be glad to.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.870
So, which way is the spring?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.750
That way, Rundel Haus.

21:17.750 --> 21:20.740
Miss Isuzu, call me Rudy.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.880
My parents call me that.

21:27.170 --> 21:28.390
Delicious!

21:29.090 --> 21:31.210
Another wonderful breakfast today!

21:31.210 --> 21:33.640
Don't you all think so?

21:33.890 --> 21:36.430
It's Nyanta's special recipe!

21:36.430 --> 21:38.290
Rudy, this is good, too.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.390
Hmm? Rudy?

21:40.900 --> 21:44.470
This is salad with mashed pumpkins.

21:40.900 --> 21:45.160
<b>Isuzu/ Adventurer                Rundel Haus Code/ Sorcerer</b>

21:44.470 --> 21:45.870
How exquisite.

21:48.430 --> 21:49.660
H-Hey...

21:50.770 --> 21:51.920
I'm sorry.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.190
There's no more soup!

21:54.190 --> 21:55.690
I... I...

21:55.690 --> 21:57.340
No, I mean...

21:59.870 --> 22:02.310
<i>Tohya's thinking the same thing?</i>

22:03.770 --> 22:06.170
You know, well...

22:07.010 --> 22:07.970
<i>No.</i>

22:08.600 --> 22:10.610
<i>It'll just end up like last time.</i>

22:11.120 --> 22:14.240
<i>If I'm too scared to say it, nothing will change.</i>

22:15.230 --> 22:16.880
<i>I have to say it!</i>

22:17.820 --> 22:19.980
Okay, breakfast is done.

22:20.430 --> 22:23.440
Let's get to the dungeon, men.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.030
Today, I'll finally—

22:27.970 --> 22:29.120
Everyone...

22:29.580 --> 22:33.530
Why don't we wait until this afternoon 
to enter the dungeon?

24:05.940 --> 24:08.630
The real answer isn't written down anywhere.

24:08.630 --> 24:10.790
Not in a textbook, on the internet,

24:10.790 --> 24:13.010
or in the notebook you're always reading.

24:13.350 --> 24:15.990
And no one can teach it to you.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.100
But when you understand it on your own,

24:19.100 --> 24:21.780
what was merely a party becomes 
a group of true friends.

24:22.100 --> 24:29.990
<b>Attack</b>

24:22.270 --> 24:24.290
Next time: Attack.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.750
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
