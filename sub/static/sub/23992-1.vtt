- I think the jetting's off.
- Yeah, I think it's the carb.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.936
I think we gotta pull
the carb again.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.070
Fine, pull it.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.641
Hey, Rick, check it out.
You got some company, man.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.845
- Freeman.
- A little engine trouble?

14:06.847 --> 14:10.315
Ah, nothin' we can't handle.
How you doin'?

14:10.317 --> 14:12.450
You're looking good.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.519
Yeah, yeah.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.454
What's goin' on?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.389
Came by to ask you a favor.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.992
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.963
Got another Nexgeneracer I was,
uh, hopin' you could take on.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.631
[sighs]
Now's not the best time.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.001
We had kind of a shitty start
to the season and--

14:30.003 --> 14:33.137
Well, the kid's smart.
Knows a lot about cars.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.373
I'm sure he does.
All your kids are great.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.375
It's just, uh..

14:37.377 --> 14:39.043
[sighs]
You know what? Look.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.045
Let me get through the weekend
and I'll call you, okay?

14:41.047 --> 14:43.648
It's a little more
urgent than that.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.183
He's sitting in jail.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.418
You wanna put a criminal
on my team?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.988
I wanna put a criminal,
um, in your house.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.823
What? Come on.

14:51.825 --> 14:52.891
[chuckles]

14:52.893 --> 14:54.859
He needs a guardian.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.561
He doesn't turn 18 till August.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.196
I don't know. I don't know.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.531
Now, the kid's had nothin'
but bad luck.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.834
His mom died of cancer
when he was little.

15:02.836 --> 15:06.604
His dad, killed in a break-in
at his shop two years ago.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.573
And he's managed to take care
of his ten-year-old sister

15:08.575 --> 15:12.010
all by himself ever since.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.113
You can't save
every kid, Freeman.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.916
He got busted for stealing
a car, but he's not a bad kid.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.018
Dash cam video nailed him
when he got a little cocky.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.052
[chuckles]

15:21.054 --> 15:22.587
Here's the footage.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.924
Uh...you should watch it.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.226
Unless this is footage of him
sweeping up a pit

15:28.228 --> 15:31.796
or hauling tires, this might not
be the spot for him.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.798
(Bulger)
'Hey, Rick,
come check this out.'

15:35.100 --> 15:37.068
I gotta go.
I'll take a look at it.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.870
But no promises, okay?

'Oh, shit!'

16:40.666 --> 16:42.066
[chuckles]

17:11.663 --> 17:14.298
You wanna stop and get, like,
a toothbrush or anything?

17:19.238 --> 17:21.339
I'm fine.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.641
Yeah, the captain said we can
swing by your apartment

17:23.643 --> 17:25.710
and grab some stuff if you want.

17:27.479 --> 17:30.548
Look, I don't need no one
taking care of me, alright?

17:32.251 --> 17:34.185
Right.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.754
You got out of jail
all by yourself.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.644
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.749
So you must be Dez.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.119
- Hello, Miss Radden.
- Oh, call me Glenda.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.688
Glenda? Like the witch?

18:10.690 --> 18:13.524
- The good witch.
- Uh, yeah, sometimes.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.892
(Rick)
'Come on.'

18:14.894 --> 18:16.594
Wh.. Don't you have
any bags or--

18:16.596 --> 18:18.529
We just came straight
from the station.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.198
Yeah.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.467
Couldn't even get
a toothbrush or anything.

18:23.569 --> 18:26.037
Rick, what's wrong with you?

18:26.039 --> 18:28.039
Come on inside.
We'll get you hooked up.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.811
Can I get you anything
to eat or drink?

18:33.813 --> 18:36.314
Um, I'm fine.

18:36.316 --> 18:39.083
Your room is right around the
corner, first door on the left.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.551
Why don't you go ahead?
I'll meet you in there.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.686
Okay.

18:45.991 --> 18:49.494
Honey, be careful where
you leave the keys, alright?

18:51.330 --> 18:52.630
- You're serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.098
This kid's a car thief, hon.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.067
Well, then he doesn't
need keys, does he?

19:05.844 --> 19:08.079
So, you're okay with this?

19:08.081 --> 19:10.681
Mm, I didn't really
have a choice, did I?

19:10.683 --> 19:13.818
- Well, I asked you.
- Mm, more like you told me.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.621
Ah, I'm not gonna argue with
you, baby. I'm not gonna do it.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.422
Well, maybe you should
go check on him, you know

19:18.424 --> 19:20.391
before he steals
all your underwear.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.595
Hey.

19:26.298 --> 19:27.398
Here.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.135
Thanks.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.472
Look, kid, this isn't a game.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.375
You got a lot to prove to me,
to Freeman

19:37.377 --> 19:40.645
to the damn
California Penal system.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.047
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready, man.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.184
Good. Lights out at 11.
We got a big day tomorrow.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.253
I ain't got no bedtime.

19:50.455 --> 19:51.856
Well, you do now.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.192
'I got a lot of shit on my plate
right now, kid'

19:54.194 --> 19:57.161
and babysittin' you
ain't my top priority.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.963
So, keep your head down
and your mouth shut

19:58.965 --> 20:00.298
and we'll get through
this summer.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.699
Yes, sir.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.936
Now you're gettin' it.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.198
So I'm comin' in,
I'm 30 feet in the air

20:34.200 --> 20:35.700
and I got that
son of a bitch sideways.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.201
'So when I come in and I land'

20:37.203 --> 20:39.270
I'm carrying a lot of speed
around that corner

20:39.272 --> 20:41.105
and they just became
innocent bystanders

20:41.107 --> 20:42.440
seeing the speed I was
carrying through--

20:42.442 --> 20:44.909
Alright, alright,
listen up, everyone.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.845
We're gonna put yesterday's
disaster behind us.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.014
We got qualifying at 11:00.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.983
'I'm gonna need
everyone on point.'

20:53.719 --> 20:56.087
What? What's the problem?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.922
You know there's a black kid
standing behind you, right?

20:59.858 --> 21:03.928
This is Dez Truss. He's one of
Captain Freeman's Nexgeneracers.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.397
He's gonna be workin'
with us this summer.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.432
How you doin'?
I'm Harvey, crew chief.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.900
Yeah.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.869
This is Bulger,
our head mechanic.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.573
- How you doin'?
- Good.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.075
- That's Robbie over there.
- What's up, dude?

21:18.077 --> 21:20.711
Of course, Trent, our driver.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.346
Nexgeneracers, huh?

21:24.449 --> 21:27.251
You know this ain't go-karts,
right, kid?

21:27.253 --> 21:29.553
- Come on, back off, Trent.
- No, no, no, no, no.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.921
Rick, it's a smart move,
you know.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.590
Reachin' out
to the urban demographic.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.458
Maybe get us a few new sponsors.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.561
Philly Blunts or one of those
fancy malt liquor companies.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.430
Yeah, we got plenty
of sponsors, Trent.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.866
You just gotta start winning,
so we can keep 'em.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.137
[scoffs]

21:46.139 --> 21:47.905
Alright, everyone,
let's get our shit together.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.341
I want you to double check
that alignment, Robbie.

21:50.343 --> 21:53.444
Speakin' of shit, Dez,
the, uh, brown water out tubes

21:53.446 --> 21:56.814
clogged on the RV, so, uh,
welcome to Team Radden.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.186
You heard him, Dez.
Head down, mouth shut, hop to.

22:13.532 --> 22:14.965
[grunts]

22:14.967 --> 22:16.033
Eww.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.369
Nice kicks.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.271
Yeah, they were.

22:20.273 --> 22:22.840
Sorry, man, you totally
coulda used these.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.475
[sighs]
The guy's an asshole.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.776
But even though,
he's the face of our team

22:25.778 --> 22:27.945
so we keep him happy.
You got it?

22:27.947 --> 22:30.648
- I got it.
- Hey, look, man, here.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.717
You get this done, I'll get you
some more work in the pit, okay?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.785
I promise, don't worry.
And hey.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.854

to be a dick all day.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.630
Yo, Dez, can you grab me
that gun over there?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.267
No, with the small socket,
the small socket.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.338
- Yeah. Thank you.
- You got it.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.207

26:30.189 --> 26:31.689
Those guys are amazing.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.028
Rough first day, huh?

26:41.199 --> 26:43.167
Trent came in eighth.

26:44.235 --> 26:46.403
You good with that?

26:46.405 --> 26:48.606
Yeah, it's not all about
finishing position

26:48.608 --> 26:50.741
and Trent had some fast laps

26:50.743 --> 26:53.010
some good passes and the truck..

26:54.479 --> 26:56.313
[sighs]
No, I'm not good with that.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.486
Top three finishers
go on the podium.

27:02.488 --> 27:05.923
Interviews, TV time..
That's what sponsors want.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.791
Trent ever go to the podium?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.593
Well, he used to all the time.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.996
That's why I paid him
the big bucks to get him here.

27:13.565 --> 27:16.767
But he only made two podiums
last season.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.970
- I'm guessing that's a problem.
- Oh, yeah.

27:19.972 --> 27:23.307
- Yeah.
- When is the next race?

27:23.309 --> 27:25.309
Two weeks. Lake Elsinore.

27:27.078 --> 27:28.245
Got it.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.750
Hey, you wanna see
something cool?

27:40.091 --> 27:42.860
[chuckles]

27:42.862 --> 27:44.862
- Whoa.
- You know what that is?

27:46.464 --> 27:48.932
- GMC Syclone.
- Yeah.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.869
Turbo V6. All wheel drive.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.104
Fastest American car in '91.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.207
Yeah, that car won me a lot
of money back in the day.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.109
How 'bout this?
You know what that is?

27:59.111 --> 28:03.213
Red Dragon, ESX STI.
Limited edition.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.815
450 horsepower.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.117
Yeah, plus 100 shot of nitrous.

28:07.119 --> 28:11.288
It's fast, but not as fast
as the Hellcat.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.058
Mm, maybe we should find out.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.459
[chuckles]

28:16.461 --> 28:18.362
Oh, snap.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.231
(Rick)
Yeah, it seems
like a lifetime ago.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.968
Damn. You were a baller.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.403
Yeah.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.739
Why you ain't still drivin'?

28:28.741 --> 28:32.476
I had a little accident.
Can't go 20 laps anymore.

28:34.012 --> 28:35.979
How many races you win?

28:37.749 --> 28:39.149
Most of 'em.

28:43.021 --> 28:46.390
Alright, the show's over.
Let's go.

29:02.407 --> 29:03.807
[Dez chuckles]

29:06.444 --> 29:07.878
When your spotter tells you

29:07.880 --> 29:10.047
Rick Radden's behind you,
uh, hold on.

29:10.049 --> 29:13.951
(male #4 on video)
'After 12 years, 3 championships
and 109 total wins'

29:13.953 --> 29:17.221
'the name Rick Radden was
synonymous with short course.'

29:17.223 --> 29:19.022
'His aggressive style
drew both praise'

29:19.024 --> 29:21.291
'and criticism
from his fellow drivers.'

29:21.293 --> 29:22.626
He's somebody that's not, uh

29:22.628 --> 29:24.294
not real high on my list,
you know?

29:24.296 --> 29:25.696
(Myan)
'He's not afraid
to drive through you.'

29:25.698 --> 29:27.131
You just gotta be tough
when you're at him.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.632
He's got the best crew
out there.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.200
'If I had his money, his team'

29:30.202 --> 29:32.069
his ride, I'd smoke him.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.204
(male #4)
'He was on his way
to a fourth championship'

29:34.206 --> 29:36.774
'until this moment in 2012.'

29:36.776 --> 29:40.043
(Seaver)
'Rick Radden and Creed are going
door to door into that jump.'

29:40.045 --> 29:41.912
- 'Oh!'
- 'Oh, no!'

29:41.914 --> 29:44.581
(Arnold)
'Radden goes for a nasty ride.'

29:44.583 --> 29:47.084
'What a vicious barrel roll.
Let's hope he's okay.'

29:47.086 --> 29:49.787
'They're pulling Radden out.
He's having trouble moving.'

29:49.789 --> 29:51.789
'This could be a career ender
for Rick Radden.'

29:51.791 --> 29:53.924
(Myan)
'Nobody, uh, likes to see
anything like that happen.'

29:53.926 --> 29:56.326
Uh, uh, we weren't the closest,
uh, that's for sure

29:56.328 --> 29:58.395
but that, that was
a tough one, but..

29:58.397 --> 30:00.497
'That, that guy,
that guy's tough..'

30:07.172 --> 30:09.740
<i>(male #4)</i>
<i>Radden returned to short course</i>
<i>last year as a team owner</i>

30:09.742 --> 30:12.176
<i>and, so far,</i>
<i>it hasn't gone very well.</i>

30:12.178 --> 30:14.178
Rick, do you consider
your first year as a team owner

30:14.180 --> 30:16.446
a failure?

30:16.448 --> 30:20.184
No, I, I wouldn't use
the, the term failure, no.

30:20.186 --> 30:24.087
Do you think 2017 will be the
breakout year for your team?

30:24.089 --> 30:27.357
Well, we're just gonna take it
one day at a time, and, um..

30:27.359 --> 30:28.859
we think you're gonna see
some good rides

30:28.861 --> 30:30.694
out of Trent Lerion this season.

30:30.696 --> 30:33.697
- 'Thank you, Rick.'
- Thank you.

30:33.699 --> 30:35.465
Alright, Dez, it's gonna be
super easy since you already

30:35.467 --> 30:37.701
know cars. You got your master
power right here, alright?

30:37.703 --> 30:40.504
Turn it on, engage the fuel pump
right there.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.040
Engage the ignition, prime it.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.209
See the pressure
go up right there?

30:45.211 --> 30:46.276
Then you just start right here.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.245
[engine revving]

30:50.215 --> 30:51.949
Alright, man, just bring it
forward nice and slow.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.350
Don't punch it.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.253
'There ya go.'

31:01.693 --> 31:03.660
(Rob MacCachren)
'Um, but after the fact
we found out that'

31:03.662 --> 31:05.896
'there was a lot of mud packed
in the passenger side wheels'

31:05.898 --> 31:07.531
'which is probably
the vibration.'

31:07.533 --> 31:09.233
We think we had a little bit
of a carburetor issue

31:09.235 --> 31:11.802
which, uh, caused a lack
of power and the engine oil..

31:11.804 --> 31:13.503
(Trent)
'Just listen to what
I'm sayin', man.'

31:13.505 --> 31:15.973
Listen here,
by increasing the front bias

31:15.975 --> 31:17.741
we'll get you more traction
in the turns.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.377
Yeah, until I hit a rut and
then I'm riding a tilt-a-whirl--

31:20.379 --> 31:22.145
How about you just take
a couple of test laps, huh?

31:22.147 --> 31:23.247
'You can do that?'

31:23.249 --> 31:24.715
Maybe you could drive the truck

31:24.717 --> 31:26.350
and I'll go maul a village.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.418
- Listen--
- Okay, hey, hey!

31:28.420 --> 31:30.087
(Harvey)
'Hey, Rick, I got this.
I'll take care of this.'

31:30.089 --> 31:31.488
I got it.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.758
'We're gonna decrease the bias.'

31:34.760 --> 31:37.194
(Bulger)
Okay. Sure.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.729
- Hey.
- 'Hi.'

31:38.731 --> 31:40.197
Hey, how are you doin'?

31:40.199 --> 31:42.766
Are they taking care
of you over there?

31:42.768 --> 31:44.768
(Tanya)
'I miss you, Dez.'

31:46.738 --> 31:48.005
I know.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.609
[sighs]
I miss you too.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.512
But hey, I'm gonna come see you.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.581
- In two weeks.
- 'Okay.'

32:02.453 --> 32:04.021
Where we at?

32:04.023 --> 32:06.690
Best lap time so far is 50.522.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.592
Trent has us starting in ninth
place later this afternoon.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.626
Damn it!

32:09.628 --> 32:11.628
[engines revving]

32:13.231 --> 32:15.832
Harvey, I'm not feelin' it.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.171
Uh, hit this next corner hard.
See if that rattles her a bit.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.548
Well, it rattled me
a little bit.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.583
Just keep runnin' on all fours.
Do what you can.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.485
We'll check it out later
before the race.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.721
- He's not feelin' it.
- Does he ever?

32:48.733 --> 32:50.400
Damn it!

32:50.402 --> 32:53.070
Hasn't anybody here
worked on a truck, anyone?

32:53.072 --> 32:54.638
Take it easy, brother.
We'll get her ready.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.672
When?

32:57.175 --> 32:59.176
No, he's right.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.745
What is it with this team?

33:01.747 --> 33:04.781
We're never on the damn podium.
The truck is a mess.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.650
If we don't get our heads
out of our asses

33:06.652 --> 33:09.353
we're gonna lose the sponsors,
we're gonna lose our team.

33:09.355 --> 33:12.789
I want this truck running
like a winner by race time!

33:12.791 --> 33:14.691
Alright! Let's do it.
Come on.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.460
Open her up, man.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.161
Harvey, what've you got?
You got somethin' for me?

33:18.163 --> 33:19.696
(Harvey)
Uh, we could try lockin'
the differential

33:19.698 --> 33:21.264
between the front
and rear wheel.

33:21.266 --> 33:23.100
- 'Didn't we already try that?'
- 'I thought we did.'

33:23.102 --> 33:24.768
- But it keeps slippin'.
- Why? Wh-why is it slipping?

33:24.770 --> 33:26.370
I don't know,
I'm not gonna know that

33:26.372 --> 33:28.372
until I get it up
and I run diagnostics.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.973
Bulger, what've you got?

33:29.975 --> 33:32.376
Boss, there's nothin'
we haven't already tried.

33:32.378 --> 33:34.077
[sighs]
Great.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.015
We could try increasing
the differential.

33:40.184 --> 33:43.487
Dez, you got somethin'?

33:43.489 --> 33:46.223
You're gonna listen to your
shop boy now? Jesus, Rick!

33:46.225 --> 33:49.559
You guys are as useful as a dog
takin' a shit on the engine.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.362
So, yeah, I'm gonna listen
to the shop boy.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.898
What do you got, buddy?
Give it to me, speak up.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.901
Okay, uh, well..

33:57.903 --> 33:59.536
...why don't you try
and go the other way?

33:59.538 --> 34:00.971
What do you mean?

34:00.973 --> 34:02.706
Instead of, like,
lockin' the differential

34:02.708 --> 34:04.307
why don't you open it?

34:04.309 --> 34:06.076
No, kid, no.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.911
We'd lose all our traction.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.913
'He's gonna slide
into stands on every turn.'

34:09.915 --> 34:12.382
MacCachren ran three seasons
on an open differential.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.351
Got him a lot of podiums.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.586
(Harvey)
Yeah, he had a completely
different driving style.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.855
I'm sure Mr. Lerion
can make the adjustment.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.490
He's gonna tell me
how to drive now.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.159
'Keep your dog on a leash,
would you?'

34:22.161 --> 34:25.028
Just listen, man.
The kid's got a point, okay?

34:25.030 --> 34:27.364
What we lose in traction,
we're gonna get in speed

34:27.366 --> 34:28.999
when we come out of those turns.

34:29.001 --> 34:30.600
You know, I'm right here, guys.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.436
I'm right here.
Don't I get a say in this?

34:32.438 --> 34:34.838
The floor is yours. Speak up.

34:38.509 --> 34:40.343
Fix the truck, Rick. Alright?

34:40.345 --> 34:42.312
I can drive it
if you idiots can fix it.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.717
Alright, let's do it.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.786
Let's do it, come on.

34:49.788 --> 34:53.623
(Seaver)
'We're racing Round 5,
Lake Elsinore Motorsports Park.'

34:53.625 --> 34:57.027
'Kyle LeDuc leads with Carl
Renezeder hot on his tail'

34:57.029 --> 34:58.562
'and Trent Lerion
in third place.'

34:58.564 --> 34:59.863
(Harvey)
'How are you feelin'?'

34:59.865 --> 35:01.231
Like driving
a broken shopping cart

35:01.233 --> 35:02.699
through a river of piss.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.102
- He's not lovin' it.
- Well, we're in third.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.169
He's doin' somethin' right.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.041

'Let's take a look at this
battle for third place.'

(Harvey)
Trent, you're doin' really good.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.915
Get some distance
between you and Barron.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.917
Get ready.
He's gonna speed by you.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.120
We're runnin' out of time.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.489

'LeDuc and Renezeder
are really bangin' it out'

to hold off Barron for third.'

(Seaver)
'Oh, Lerion barely moves on
as they come out of Turn 2.'

35:31.263 --> 35:33.230
He's gotta accelerate more
into the turns.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.934
He needs to come in harder
on the turns.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.904
I'm not payin' him to
participate. I want that podium!

35:40.906 --> 35:42.739
Come on, man.
Put some slam on that throttle.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.708
This one's yours, buddy.

35:48.846 --> 35:50.747

'Well, it looks like
Lerion's got another gear.'

space between him and Barron.'

Come on!

'And as they battle
coming into the checkered flag'

'Carl Renezeder barely holds off
Kyle LeDuc for the win'

'and look at this,
Trent Lerion in third.'

36:03.162 --> 36:04.694
- Whoo!
- Alright!

36:04.696 --> 36:06.630
Oh, my God, man!

- Finally. Finally.
- Finally.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.536

- I don't give a shit.

Alright, Trent.

36:55.846 --> 36:58.548
What's the problem, man?
The kid's with us.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.550
And he won us the race.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.688
So open the gate.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.856
- Whatever.
- Thank you.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.992
(male announcer #2)
Alright, once again,
now we got Trent Lerion here

37:08.994 --> 37:10.527
in third place. We're gonna
go over and talk to him.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.896
Trent, you know,
this has been a long time coming

37:12.898 --> 37:14.731
'back in the podium
for Team Radden.'

37:14.733 --> 37:16.099
I can tell by the smile
on your face

37:16.101 --> 37:17.500
you're just stoked to be here.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.736
Yeah, it feels, uh,
feels really good.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.239
You know, it's uh,
it's been a long overdue time

37:22.241 --> 37:24.541
to get this fantastic Rockstar
truck up on this podium.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.577
Um, I pulled some great moves
today, but, uh

37:27.579 --> 37:30.146
I gotta give a shout out
to one guy who made this happen.

37:32.016 --> 37:34.517
Harvey Pearson, our crew chief.

37:34.519 --> 37:37.587
Yeah, brother.
Yeah, we did it. I'm back.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.923
And tomorrow, we're gonna be
on top of this podium.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.092
So I'm comin' for you, Carl.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.294
(male announcer #2)
'Trent Lerion, everybody,
third place.'

37:48.899 --> 37:50.867
What are you doin', kid?
Come on.

37:54.739 --> 37:57.540
So, where did you learn
so much about cars?

38:00.745 --> 38:03.146
My pops owned a shop
in Inglewood.

38:05.249 --> 38:07.217
Grew up in that shop.

38:08.886 --> 38:11.588
[engine revving]

38:11.590 --> 38:13.923
Yeah. You hear that!

38:13.925 --> 38:16.259
Sounds like she's runnin'
on tiger bend.

38:16.261 --> 38:17.594
Makes me wanna drink
dragon blood

38:17.596 --> 38:18.828
and do karate
on a mountain, man!

38:18.830 --> 38:20.330
[laughing]

38:20.332 --> 38:22.265
Alright, let's get her in
and check her out.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.967
Hey, Dez.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.336
You get to clean every speck
of mud off this vehicle.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.338
[laughing]

38:29.407 --> 38:30.774
(Dez)
'Great.'

38:30.776 --> 38:32.309
[engine sputters]

38:35.513 --> 38:37.514
It ain't goin' into gear.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.651
Had to jinx us, huh?

38:48.993 --> 38:50.360
[groaning]

38:50.362 --> 38:52.329
(Trent)
'Ah, shit!'

38:52.331 --> 38:55.532
- Yo, you okay?
- No, man, that really hurt.

38:56.267 --> 38:57.500
Let me see.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.135
Ah, I just jammed it
with the wrench.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.204
I finished the assembly though.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.006
Can you drive?

39:03.008 --> 39:05.342
I can steer, but not to shift.
This thing's throbbing already.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.677
- Oh, it's that bad?
- It hurts, dude.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.116
Well, if you can't drive,
the kid could do it.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.719
- Rick is that a good idea?
- Yeah, yeah, he could do it.

39:17.388 --> 39:18.855
Go on, kid, suit up.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.363
Right, there.

39:26.365 --> 39:29.766
- Okay, all set.
- Alright, kid, let's do it.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.036
[engine revving]

39:39.844 --> 39:42.011
Shift it to second,
real smooth.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.980
'We're not doin' any jumps'.'

39:46.550 --> 39:48.585
Alright, now to third.

39:55.993 --> 39:58.595
Okay, now. Shift back down
to the second for the hairpin.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.933
Goin' pretty good.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.069
Let's see how he does
under load.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.904
Alright, kid,
you got a straightaway comin'.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.240
'I want you to go three-quarters
throttle to third'

40:10.242 --> 40:12.275
and then brake before the jump.

40:12.277 --> 40:13.610
I can handle the jump.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.044
No, no, kid, you gotta learn
how to launch it

40:15.046 --> 40:16.379
so you don't nosedive.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.348
[engine revving]

40:31.061 --> 40:33.029
Hey, slow down, kid.

40:34.465 --> 40:36.032
Slow down!

40:43.808 --> 40:46.409
Kinda like that, boss?

40:46.411 --> 40:48.945
Yeah, kinda like that.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.647
(Dez)
Don't worry. man.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.649
In my former line of work

40:52.651 --> 40:55.485
it was also important
not to damage the product.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.456
(Bulger)
'Looking pretty strong.'

40:59.458 --> 41:01.257
Might wanna open her up
a little bit.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.560
See her full throttle.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.895
Hey, kid, do you think
you can do it again..

41:05.897 --> 41:07.430
'only a little faster
this time?'

41:07.432 --> 41:09.432
Hey, you got it, boss.

41:09.434 --> 41:11.100
Remember, I only got one truck.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.069
[engine revving]

41:25.015 --> 41:27.050
Not bad. Not bad.

41:28.452 --> 41:30.286
It's shiftin' clean, boss.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.922
'Up and down.'

41:32.924 --> 41:35.091
Hey, Dez.
Why don't you take another lap?

41:36.460 --> 41:38.428
What? She's not
even warmed up yet.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.836
[engine revving]

41:49.640 --> 41:51.007
Where are you going?

41:51.009 --> 41:53.443
Nice control, kid. Nice control.

41:53.445 --> 41:55.411
[engine revving]

42:04.522 --> 42:06.456
55.2.

42:06.458 --> 42:09.225
Shit, man, that ain't half bad.

42:09.227 --> 42:11.227
[engine revving]

42:14.565 --> 42:15.598
Alright.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.034
Nice.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.206
[clamoring]

42:24.675 --> 42:25.808
- Take it easy.
- I got it, I got it.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.043
Don't touch my truck, man.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.878
It's my truck
and I told him to drive

42:28.880 --> 42:30.680
because you're too busy
partying.

42:30.682 --> 42:32.015
- No, no.
- Chill, chill.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.083
Settle down, take it easy.

42:34.085 --> 42:35.885
Alright, Rick.
How 'bout this, alright?

42:35.887 --> 42:37.887
The black prick
touches my truck again

42:37.889 --> 42:40.423
and you find a new driver.
How 'bout that?

42:45.429 --> 42:47.630
- You alright?
- Yeah, man. Talk to him.

43:05.616 --> 43:08.484
- Anyone hear anything?
- Nope.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.754
I'm callin' him again.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.022
(male announcer)
'Final call for qualifying.'

43:13.024 --> 43:14.591
'All drivers to pre-grid.'

43:14.593 --> 43:17.627
Alright, someone go out
and find his ass.

43:17.629 --> 43:20.797
Yo, his ass is here.
Robbie, will you grab my suit?

43:20.799 --> 43:23.066
You got two minutes to qualify.

43:23.068 --> 43:25.802
Relax, old man, alright.
Winners need their beauty sleep.

43:25.804 --> 43:27.804
You didn't win, idiot.

43:31.075 --> 43:34.310
And I hear you were out
till 5:00 a.m.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.312
You look like shit.

43:36.314 --> 43:38.715
- You stink of Jager.
- 'You smelling me now?'

43:38.717 --> 43:41.084
I didn't have time to shower.
Back off, Rick.

43:41.086 --> 43:43.119
Are you still drunk?

43:43.121 --> 43:45.088
He's drunk.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.056
Maybe you don't remember
being in your 20s, buddy.

43:47.058 --> 43:48.725
- But I process that shit.
- Oh, yeah?

43:48.727 --> 43:50.259
You wanna take a breathalyzer
and prove it?

43:50.261 --> 43:51.894
He's gonna be fine, boss.
He's gonna be fine.

43:51.896 --> 43:54.297
- Let's just get ready to roll.
- Yeah, boss.

43:54.299 --> 43:55.598
- Chill out.
- Whoa, whoa.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.567
[clamoring]

43:59.069 --> 44:00.903
Don't you ever
put your hand on me!

44:00.905 --> 44:02.805
Try to picture, pal. Alright.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.574
You want podiums?
You want TV time?

44:04.576 --> 44:07.744
Get used to this face.
'Cause it is Team Radden.

44:07.746 --> 44:09.912
Not anymore. You're fired.

44:09.914 --> 44:13.016
Rick, whoa, hey, Rick.
Come on, man, use your brain.

44:13.018 --> 44:14.684
Hey, we gotta get a truck
in this race.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.452
We're gonna lose
our series points.

44:16.454 --> 44:19.122
What points? A bunch
of bottom-half finishes.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.189
Who gives a shit?

44:20.191 --> 44:21.791
You really wanna do this, Rick?

44:21.793 --> 44:23.926
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

44:23.928 --> 44:26.295
Kiss your sponsors goodbye, pal.

44:26.297 --> 44:29.298
You're gonna be back to living
off your wife by tomorrow.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.267
Get out of my pit.

44:31.269 --> 44:33.836
You were always holdin' me back
anyway, old man.

44:33.838 --> 44:35.672
<i>Adios, succos.</i>

44:37.207 --> 44:39.208
What the hell was that?

44:44.481 --> 44:47.183
(Rick)
'What? What are you doin'?'

44:47.185 --> 44:49.485
What, you want out too?

44:49.487 --> 44:50.887
Outta what?

44:50.889 --> 44:52.555
We're done.
Qualifying started.

44:52.557 --> 44:54.490
Well, you don't need
to qualify to race.

44:54.492 --> 44:55.825
Race?

44:55.827 --> 44:58.127
- We don't got a driver.
- Yeah, we do.

45:03.133 --> 45:05.134
The kid.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.336
- Wait, what?
- You could do this, kid.

45:07.338 --> 45:09.172
No, no, no.
Last night was great and all

45:09.174 --> 45:11.708
but that was an open track.
This is the real deal, guys.

45:11.710 --> 45:15.878
You wanna put a shop boy in a
Pro 4 truck with no seat time.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.381
He's had a good five, six
minutes on the track.

45:18.383 --> 45:22.485
- Yeah, seven at least.
- Jesus, Rick.

45:22.487 --> 45:26.055
- You lost your mind, man.
- Hey, look, this is happening.

45:26.057 --> 45:29.058
You're gonna join us or you
gonna go off with your boy?

45:29.060 --> 45:30.560
It's your call.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.468
I don't want my name
anywhere near this train, Rick.

45:41.371 --> 45:45.408
Oh, this is great, huh?
This is, this is good.

45:48.178 --> 45:49.579
Anyone else?

45:51.248 --> 45:52.648
Bulger?

45:54.184 --> 45:57.353
Alright,
let's get this rig ready.

45:57.355 --> 45:59.155
Come on, man.
Let's get you suited up.

46:04.394 --> 46:07.163
[dramatic music]

46:16.306 --> 46:18.307
Looking good.

46:18.309 --> 46:20.443
Hey, kid, look,
I had to lie a little.

46:20.445 --> 46:23.446
I told the officials
you raced short track in Mexico.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.815
- Mexico?
- Just roll with it if they ask.

46:25.817 --> 46:27.650
- Alright.
- Alright, look, just..

46:27.652 --> 46:29.786
Keep it on all fours
for the first 12 laps

46:29.788 --> 46:31.120
and then we'll take it
from there.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.256
Alright.

46:33.258 --> 46:36.225
Look, you got skills.

46:36.227 --> 46:37.627
I know it.

46:37.629 --> 46:40.129
Freeman knew it too.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.331
I think that's why
he sent you to me.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.868
You got this.

46:48.305 --> 46:49.505
Alright.

46:52.609 --> 46:55.311
[retches]

46:55.313 --> 46:57.680
Attaboy! Lighten the load.

at our starting grid'

he's raced down in Mexico.'

Alright, now we'll start in last
row 'cause we didn't qualify.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.146
'That's okay.
That's a good thing.'

47:30.148 --> 47:31.981

to warm up.'

- Hell, yeah.

- Stay on all fours.

Oh, I can't see a thing.

48:01.845 --> 48:03.946
- Oh, shit.
- You okay, kid?

48:05.983 --> 48:07.583
Like a pinball.

48:07.585 --> 48:08.885
(Rick)
'Yeah, you'll get used to that.'

48:10.254 --> 48:12.521
That's it. Hang back.

48:12.523 --> 48:14.724

still holdin' up.

1:17:02.051 --> 1:17:03.718
The entire wiring..

1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:05.519
That's not to mention
the damn engine.

1:17:07.389 --> 1:17:09.890
Man, that's gonna be
150 grand, man, easy.

1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:15.997
Uh, hey, guys.
Check it out.

1:17:20.335 --> 1:17:21.736
Still got this.

1:17:27.275 --> 1:17:29.343
Yo, this is Dez.

1:17:29.345 --> 1:17:30.911
Yeah, I know.

1:17:30.913 --> 1:17:33.814
[clears throat]
You still workin' in the, uh

1:17:33.816 --> 1:17:35.182
in the repair shop, man?

1:17:35.184 --> 1:17:38.419
Yo, Chris man, this is Dez.

1:17:38.421 --> 1:17:41.956
Quick question, are you still
good with a welder?

1:17:41.958 --> 1:17:44.925
Yo, um, this is Dez.

1:17:44.927 --> 1:17:46.927
I kinda need a favor
from you, man.

1:17:55.837 --> 1:17:58.339
Dez gave it to me.

1:17:58.341 --> 1:17:59.874
Tanya made it.

1:18:02.978 --> 1:18:05.179
He's a good kid.

1:18:05.181 --> 1:18:06.580
They both are.

1:18:09.117 --> 1:18:11.218
I really liked having him here
this summer.

1:18:13.288 --> 1:18:16.490
- You know, like a real family.
- Baby.

1:18:16.492 --> 1:18:19.527
Oh, come on,
it wasn't his fault.

1:18:19.529 --> 1:18:21.929
And it wasn't your fault either.

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:25.299
And you trusted your gut

1:18:25.301 --> 1:18:27.601
and made the right choice
bringin' him here.

1:18:49.424 --> 1:18:51.592
Well, it's about time
you got here.

1:18:51.594 --> 1:18:53.561
Dude, I can't deal
with this shit right now.

1:18:53.563 --> 1:18:56.230
Come on, boss.
Got somethin' to show you.

1:18:56.232 --> 1:18:58.499
Come on, man. Trust me.

1:19:07.776 --> 1:19:08.843
Yeah.

1:19:12.414 --> 1:19:13.914
What's goin' on?

1:19:18.086 --> 1:19:19.687
Freeman?

1:19:19.689 --> 1:19:21.422
Remember the old race truck
you donated

1:19:21.424 --> 1:19:23.858
to Nexgeneracers?

1:19:23.860 --> 1:19:27.261
- Yeah.
- We donated it back to you.

1:19:27.263 --> 1:19:30.364
And the spare engine didn't get
destroyed during the break-in.

1:19:30.366 --> 1:19:32.099
She's still firin', boss.

1:19:36.304 --> 1:19:38.806
It's all great, guys..

1:19:38.808 --> 1:19:41.408
...but the season's over.

1:19:41.410 --> 1:19:43.778
We can still run
in the Challenge Cup.

1:19:43.780 --> 1:19:45.613
'Show those sponsors
what we can do.'

1:19:53.288 --> 1:19:55.589
Can you get it ready
by Saturday?

1:19:55.591 --> 1:19:56.891
Oh, yeah.

1:19:56.893 --> 1:19:58.125
We got a whole crew
of people

1:19:58.127 --> 1:20:00.094
workin' here to make
that happen.

1:20:00.096 --> 1:20:02.329
Let me introduce you.

1:20:02.331 --> 1:20:06.167
'Letty Simons,
Nexgeneracers, 1998.'

1:20:13.909 --> 1:20:15.676
And our man here, Dez..

1:20:17.078 --> 1:20:18.646
'...made it all happen.'

1:20:25.187 --> 1:20:26.654
Thanks, kid.

1:20:30.759 --> 1:20:33.127
And the tires look new. Where'd
you guys get all this stuff?

1:20:33.129 --> 1:20:36.997
Oh, man. You know how I roll.

1:20:36.999 --> 1:20:39.233
'I wanna introduce you
to two more people, come on.'

1:20:43.538 --> 1:20:45.806
Rick, this is Bob
and Charlotte Henderson

1:20:45.808 --> 1:20:47.274
from Protect The Harvest.

1:20:47.276 --> 1:20:48.676
- Glad to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1:20:48.678 --> 1:20:50.177
Hi.

1:20:50.179 --> 1:20:52.313
They're Nexgeneracers'
greatest benefactors.

1:20:52.315 --> 1:20:55.316
They wanna sponsor the team
for the Challenge Cup.

1:20:55.318 --> 1:20:57.051
I hope you like the idea
because this guy's

1:20:57.053 --> 1:20:59.954
already spent about
half the money.

1:20:59.956 --> 1:21:03.490
When Charles Wilson and Rodney
Reid founded Nexgeneracers

1:21:03.492 --> 1:21:06.994
it was their dream to get
one of their kids on the podium.

1:21:06.996 --> 1:21:10.798
Now we can get this car goin',
but Dez won't take the wheel

1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:12.600
unless you're at the helm.

1:21:15.070 --> 1:21:19.707
Mr. and Mrs. Henderson,
you guys got yourselves a team.

1:21:19.709 --> 1:21:22.376
- Thank you very much.
- That's good. Good.

'Everyone's looking
for next year's sponsorship.'

1:21:41.397 --> 1:21:43.764
Actually, Dave, we were excited
about the opportunity

1:21:43.766 --> 1:21:45.232
and idea of coming out
and expanding

1:21:45.234 --> 1:21:47.167
our program
into the off road series.

1:21:47.169 --> 1:21:49.103
I wanna try and do my homework.
I wanna know that we're gonna be

1:21:49.105 --> 1:21:51.572
able to put together a good team
to win 'cause, we hate to lose.

1:22:02.384 --> 1:22:04.418
Alright, team. Ready!

1:22:06.454 --> 1:22:08.122
What? What is it?

1:22:08.124 --> 1:22:10.124
You know, there's a white woman
standin' behind you.

1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:15.195
Honey, what are you doin' here?

1:22:15.197 --> 1:22:17.364
I came to see my family race.

1:22:18.700 --> 1:22:21.035
You better get
that Challenge Cup, kid.

1:22:21.037 --> 1:22:23.470
We're gonna try.

1:22:23.472 --> 1:22:24.805
Try?

1:22:27.042 --> 1:22:29.243
You're Rick Radden.

1:22:29.245 --> 1:22:31.011
You're damn right, I am.

1:22:33.949 --> 1:22:35.482
Get it.

1:22:39.888 --> 1:22:43.390

Uh.. Yeah, why?

Bunch of crazy white boys
with big trucks

1:23:02.745 --> 1:23:05.679
not carin' about points
or damage.

1:23:05.681 --> 1:23:08.415
It's gonna be kinda like that.
So be ready.

1:23:11.252 --> 1:23:13.320
Thanks for the heads up.

1:23:13.322 --> 1:23:14.488

still smoking. That was a big..'

1:28:25.901 --> 1:28:27.901
(Arnold)
'You see, they're also towing
off Bryce Menzies.'

1:28:27.903 --> 1:28:30.504
'We told you the gloves were
gonna come off in this race.'

1:28:30.506 --> 1:28:32.472
'And it has not disappointed.'

1:28:35.143 --> 1:28:38.912
Alright, Dez. Adler's up next.
Stay on target.

1:28:38.914 --> 1:28:41.615
(Arnold)
'With Menzies officially out,
guess who inherits the lead.'

1:28:41.617 --> 1:28:44.418
(Seaver)
'Yeah, it's nine times champ
Carl Renezeder, of course.'

1:28:44.420 --> 1:28:46.920
'Adler moves into second
and a rookie Dez Truss'

1:28:46.922 --> 1:28:49.022
'is in a podium position.'

1:28:49.024 --> 1:28:52.659
Head down, mouth shut.
Get ready to roll.

1:28:52.661 --> 1:28:54.661
(male announcer)
'And we are
green, green, green.'

1:28:56.931 --> 1:28:59.466
(Seaver)
'Carl Renezeder is gonna lead
them into Turn 1'

1:28:59.468 --> 1:29:02.669
'followed by Adler, Truss,
Trent Lerion and Doug Matag'

1:29:02.671 --> 1:29:04.971
'and that is it.
Five trucks left.'

1:29:04.973 --> 1:29:06.840
(Arnold)
'Attrition is the name
of the game here'

1:29:06.842 --> 1:29:08.008
'in today's Challenge Cup.'

1:29:08.010 --> 1:29:09.276
'At least this will cut down'

1:29:09.278 --> 1:29:10.877
'on the collisions.'

1:29:10.879 --> 1:29:12.779
- 'Oh! Whoa!'
- Oh!'

1:29:15.883 --> 1:29:18.885
(Seaver)
'And Adler goes over the gear
rail and sticks the landing.'

1:29:18.887 --> 1:29:20.287
(Arnold)
'I give it a ten.'

1:29:20.289 --> 1:29:22.889
I guess Adler's done.

1:29:22.891 --> 1:29:25.559
(Arnold)
'Those deep ruts in Turn 3
make it a dangerous corner'

1:29:25.561 --> 1:29:27.894
'especially when tryin'
to pass.'

1:29:27.896 --> 1:29:30.230
(Seaver)
'And now we are down
to just four trucks.'

1:29:31.799 --> 1:29:33.800
It's me and you, Carl.

1:29:33.802 --> 1:29:35.736
Me and you.

1:29:35.738 --> 1:29:37.704
(male announcer)
'We are gonna go ahead
and let the track'

1:29:37.706 --> 1:29:40.874
'go green, green, green.'

1:29:40.876 --> 1:29:43.310
(Seaver)
'Renezeder, Truss,
Lerion and Matag.'

1:29:43.312 --> 1:29:45.812
'I can tell ya, one of these
guys won't make the podium.'

1:29:45.814 --> 1:29:47.714
'That is a safe bet.'

1:29:55.656 --> 1:29:57.124
Stay on him, stay on him.

1:30:00.094 --> 1:30:02.262
(Seaver)
'Though a lot of people
doubted Rick Radden'

1:30:02.264 --> 1:30:04.197
'when he let Lerion go
this season--'

1:30:04.199 --> 1:30:06.533
(Arnold)
'Here comes Lerion
to try to prove it'

1:30:06.535 --> 1:30:09.336
'but Truss is having
none of it.'

1:30:09.338 --> 1:30:10.737
(Rick)
'Listen, now take him.'

1:30:10.739 --> 1:30:12.672
You look clear on the next one.

1:30:12.674 --> 1:30:14.174
Take a shot. Go in hard.

1:30:16.711 --> 1:30:19.880
(Arnold)
'I'll tell ya, when Carl
Renezeder is driving this well'

1:30:19.882 --> 1:30:22.115
'it's very tough for anyone
to get around him.'

1:30:22.117 --> 1:30:24.151
'Let alone
a 17-year-old rookie.'

1:30:26.254 --> 1:30:29.089
(Seaver)
'Yet here comes Truss tryin'
to slide underneath Renezeder.'

1:30:29.091 --> 1:30:31.958
'I don't think there's enough
room.. Oh, contact.'

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:33.960
(Seaver)
'Renezeder's okay.
Truss gets turned around.'

1:30:33.962 --> 1:30:37.531
- 'And Lerion flies by.'
-  <i>Adios, succos!</i>

1:30:37.533 --> 1:30:38.865
Dude!

1:30:38.867 --> 1:30:41.268
[engine cranking]

1:30:41.270 --> 1:30:43.703
(Seaver)
'Oh, if Truss can't get
that truck refired'

1:30:43.705 --> 1:30:45.772
'that'll be it for Team Radden''

1:30:45.774 --> 1:30:48.074
Excellent! Excellent!
He's all yours.

1:30:48.076 --> 1:30:50.110
(Seaver)
'And the rest of the field
continues on.'

1:30:51.813 --> 1:30:53.013
Come on.

1:30:54.382 --> 1:30:57.217
It ain't startin'. Come on!

1:30:57.219 --> 1:30:58.819
(Seaver)
'Oh, we've come to a caution.'

1:30:58.821 --> 1:31:00.954
'That will buy Truss
a few more seconds'

1:31:00.956 --> 1:31:03.223
'to try to get
that truck restarted.'

1:31:03.225 --> 1:31:05.158
(Robbie)
'Dez, listen,
it might just be flooded'

1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:07.127
'so turn off the fuel pump
and crank it a couple times.'

1:31:07.129 --> 1:31:09.596
(Dez)
'Okay, okay, I'm tryin' it now.'

1:31:09.598 --> 1:31:10.997
Come on!

1:31:13.134 --> 1:31:14.501
[engine revving]

1:31:14.503 --> 1:31:16.503
- God!
- 'Wait now.'

1:31:16.505 --> 1:31:19.105
(Seaver)
'Truss is not out yet.
He's got that truck restarted'

1:31:19.107 --> 1:31:20.674
'and comin' out
of the yellow flag'

1:31:20.676 --> 1:31:22.642
'will bunch these trucks
right back up.'

1:31:22.644 --> 1:31:23.977
(Arnold)
'Well, the good news is,
this is gonna'

1:31:23.979 --> 1:31:25.812
'put him back in that pack.'

1:31:25.814 --> 1:31:29.015
'But the bad news is,
he's lost his podium position'

1:31:29.017 --> 1:31:31.084
'and he doesn't have much time
to work with.'

1:31:34.422 --> 1:31:36.456
(Rick)
'Get back in there.
We're not out of this.'

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:39.659
We got three cars to beat,
three laps to do it.

1:31:39.661 --> 1:31:42.128
- 'Make it happen, kid.'
- Check!

1:31:42.130 --> 1:31:44.664
(male announcer)
'Race band 17 of Renezeder
will start the race.'

1:31:44.666 --> 1:31:45.999
'Here we go.'

1:31:46.001 --> 1:31:48.034
'And we are
green, green, green.'

1:31:55.776 --> 1:31:59.279
(Seaver)
'Trent Lerion's on Renezeder's
bumper looking for an opening.'

1:32:01.883 --> 1:32:03.884
(Arnold)
'Oh, but here comes Dez Truss'

1:32:03.886 --> 1:32:06.553
'trying to claim a podium slot
back from the pack.'

1:32:06.555 --> 1:32:10.123
(Seaver)
'He dives under the 81 and he's
gonna slack right into third.'

1:32:10.125 --> 1:32:11.358
Awesome.

1:32:24.639 --> 1:32:26.973
(Arnold)
'Lerion now holding on
to second place.'

1:32:26.975 --> 1:32:28.875
'Dez Truss is on the move
giving Lerion'

1:32:28.877 --> 1:32:30.810
'a little love tap
to come out of the corner.'

1:32:30.812 --> 1:32:33.246
(Seaver)
'They are door to door
over the whoop section.'

1:32:33.248 --> 1:32:36.383
'Truss slides in underneath
and he goes up on two wheels'

1:32:36.385 --> 1:32:38.351
'as he passes Lerion
into second'

1:32:38.353 --> 1:32:39.719
'and the white flag is out.'

1:32:41.355 --> 1:32:42.923
Son of a bitch!

1:32:42.925 --> 1:32:44.658
(Seaver)
'Renezeder's still in the lead'

1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:47.527
'in the final lap.'

1:32:47.529 --> 1:32:49.062
(Arnold)
'He's comin' up
with that left-hander again.'

1:32:49.064 --> 1:32:50.564
'If he's gonna make
something happen'

1:32:50.566 --> 1:32:52.766
'this corner's gonna be
his best opportunity.'

1:32:52.768 --> 1:32:54.768
'He wasn't so successful
last time.'

1:32:54.770 --> 1:32:57.370
- I'm going for it.
- 'No, no, no. Hold on.'

1:32:57.372 --> 1:32:58.672
- What?
- 'It's an obvious move.'

1:32:58.674 --> 1:33:01.341
(Rick)
'He'd expect you
to turn to him.'

1:33:01.343 --> 1:33:03.443
(Seaver)
'Oh, Truss missed
his chance there.'

1:33:03.445 --> 1:33:05.779
'I don't see him
catching Renezeder now.'

1:33:05.781 --> 1:33:08.214
But you bet he won't expect it
in Turn 3.

1:33:08.216 --> 1:33:09.482
Got it.

1:33:12.553 --> 1:33:13.787
He's yours, Dez.

1:33:17.391 --> 1:33:19.593
(Seaver)
'Oh, Truss passes Renezeder
in Turn 3.'

1:33:19.595 --> 1:33:21.561
Yes, go.

1:33:21.563 --> 1:33:23.463
(Seaver)
'And he's pullin' away
with one turn to go.'

1:33:23.465 --> 1:33:25.932
'What a run to the finish.
Dez Truss goes for the match.'

1:33:25.934 --> 1:33:28.435
'To the front, to the back,
to the front!'

1:33:28.437 --> 1:33:29.636
Come on, Dez.

1:33:42.717 --> 1:33:44.451
[cheering]

1:33:44.453 --> 1:33:47.554
- You did it, kid!
- Ha ha!

1:33:47.556 --> 1:33:50.824
(Seaver)
'And Dez Truss wins
the Challenge Cup.'

1:33:50.826 --> 1:33:54.728
'Ladies and gentleman, that was
one of the craziest races'

1:33:54.730 --> 1:33:56.129
'I have ever seen.'

1:33:59.567 --> 1:34:01.568
Get me Forrest Lucas.

1:34:01.570 --> 1:34:03.803
I've got a team
for him to sponsor.

No one's comin' in or out.'
