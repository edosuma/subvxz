WEBVTT

00:07.638 --> 00:08.639
MELISSA & JOEY WAS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.643
( loud belch )

00:13.644 --> 00:16.216
OH?

00:16.217 --> 00:19.189
GOOD, COMPANY.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.121
I'M SORRY. JOE SAID IT WAS OKAY

00:21.122 --> 00:23.793
IF I WAITED HERE WHILE JEREMY
FINISHED HIS TUTORING SESSION.

00:23.794 --> 00:25.155
SURE, IT'S TOTALLY FINE

00:25.156 --> 00:27.797
THAT JOE HAS TURNED MY
DINING ROOM INTO HIS LOBBY.

00:27.798 --> 00:29.699
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
YOU'RE A VICTIM

00:29.700 --> 00:31.101
AS AM I.

00:31.102 --> 00:32.533
I USUALLY USE A GLASS.

00:34.805 --> 00:36.136
ALL RIGHT, JEREMY, SO
LOOK, THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:36.137 --> 00:38.468
A REALLY GOOD HISTORY ESSAY.
ONLY THING IS, NEXT TIME,

00:38.469 --> 00:40.210
TMZ DUDE IS NOT A
RELIABLE SOURCE

00:40.211 --> 00:41.812
FOR ABE LINCOLN'S
SUMMER ROMANCES.

00:43.374 --> 00:45.615
BESIDES THAT, GREAT JOB. I'LL
SEE YOU THURSDAY AT 4:00.

00:45.616 --> 00:46.816
ALL RIGHT?

00:46.817 --> 00:48.678
AND I WILL SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT 8:00.

00:48.679 --> 00:50.351
I CAN'T WAIT.

00:55.626 --> 00:58.328
SO IS THIS WHOLE
TUTORING BUSINESS

00:58.329 --> 01:02.362
JUST A FRONT SO YOU CAN FIND A
DATE WITHOUT LEAVING MY GARAGE?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.564
I DON'T FIND DATES.
DATES FIND ME.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.837
YEAH, IF THE GPS IS SET
TO INSANELY LARGE EGO...

01:07.838 --> 01:10.700
TAKE A LEFT AT
DELUSIONAL ARROGANCE.

01:10.701 --> 01:13.603
MOCK AWAY, BURKE, MOCK AWAY.

01:13.604 --> 01:15.105
BUT YOU KNOW WHO ELSE FINDS ME?
CLIENTS.

01:15.106 --> 01:17.076
AND I'M NOT EVEN ADVERTISING.
IT'S ALL BY WORD OF MOUTH.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.708
YEAH, WELL, I SAW WHAT
HER MOUTH WAS DOING

01:18.709 --> 01:20.280
AND THERE WERE NO
WORDS COMING OUT.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.782
JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LITTLE
GARAGE TUTORING BUSINESS

01:22.783 --> 01:24.454
DOESN'T GET IN THE WAY
OF YOUR REAL JOB.

01:24.455 --> 01:27.717
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. TUTORING RYDER
IS STILL MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

01:27.718 --> 01:30.660
NO, ME. ME! I'M YOUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

01:30.661 --> 01:32.722
I NEED YOU TO DO IMPORTANT
ESSENTIAL THINGS FOR ME.

01:32.723 --> 01:34.164
OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DID YOU GET THOSE

01:34.165 --> 01:35.295
TWO DEAD SQUIRRELS
OUT OF THE GUTTER?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.567
I GOT ONE AND A HALF.

01:37.568 --> 01:39.369
DON'T ASK.

01:39.370 --> 01:41.201
HAPPY NOT TO.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.233
YOU KNOW AS LONG AS MY
NEEDS ARE TENDED TO,

01:43.234 --> 01:45.275
YOU CAN USE YOUR FREE
TIME HOW EVER YOU WANT.

01:45.276 --> 01:46.536
OH, WHY THANK YOU.

01:46.537 --> 01:49.108
THANK YOU, MY MOST GRAND
AND BENEFICENT LEADER.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.680
YOUR GENEROSITY IS ONLY EXCEEDED

01:50.681 --> 01:53.843
BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
THAT YOU SPEND ON SHOES.

01:53.844 --> 01:55.645
KEEP IT UP. ( snaps )

01:55.646 --> 01:56.687
I LIKE THAT.

THEY COME FROM A CHICKEN?!

02:22.513 --> 02:23.843
I MEAN I KNEW THEY
CAME FROM A CHICKEN.

02:23.844 --> 02:28.448
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE YOU MIX
THEM WITH BUFFALO BITS.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.479
IS IT OKAY IF I TELL YOU

02:29.480 --> 02:32.182
WHERE ANGEL HAIR
PASTA COMES FROM?

02:32.183 --> 02:34.354
HEY, AUNT MEL.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.925
COULD WE TALK TO YOU?

02:35.926 --> 02:39.189
WE'VE GOT NEWS, VERY BIG NEWS.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.790
OH MY GOD, SHE'S PREGNANT.

02:40.791 --> 02:44.264
OF COURSE SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.
RIGHT, HONEY?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.735
NO, NO. THIS IS ABOUT COLLEGE.

02:45.736 --> 02:46.866
( sighs ) IT'S ABOUT COLLEGE.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.639
YOU CAN RELAX 'CAUSE I
WAS ALREADY RELAXED.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.201
WELL, YOU KNOW WE EACH
GOT INTO FIVE SCHOOLS.

02:51.202 --> 02:52.802
SO THIS IS THE WEEK WHERE
EVERYBODY HAS TO DECIDE

02:52.803 --> 02:53.843
WHICH COLLEGE THEY'RE
GONNA ACCEPT.

02:53.844 --> 02:55.205
AND YOU DECIDED?

02:55.206 --> 02:57.347
OH! LENNOX, IS IT OBERLIN?
YOU'LL FIT RIGHT IN THERE.

02:57.348 --> 03:01.180
ACTUALLY, ZANDER AND I
HAVE CHOSEN TO ATTEND

03:01.181 --> 03:03.614
THE COLLEGE OF LIFE!

03:04.815 --> 03:07.717
IS THAT A CANADIAN SCHOOL?

03:07.718 --> 03:09.819
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.221
OKAY.

03:11.222 --> 03:12.792
LET'S HIT THE PAUSE
BUTTON ON THE KISSING

03:12.793 --> 03:14.264
AND FAST FORWARD
TO THE 'SPLAININ'.

03:14.265 --> 03:16.466
WELL, YOU KNOW?

03:16.467 --> 03:18.428
ZANDER AND I WERE SO
STRESSED ABOUT WHERE TO GO

03:18.429 --> 03:19.869
AND WHAT OUR FUTURES
WILL LOOK LIKE.

03:19.870 --> 03:22.502
AND REALLY COLLEGE DOESN'T
GUARANTEE YOU A JOB.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.804
I MEAN, LOOK AT JOE.
HE'S GOT AN M.B.A.

03:24.975 --> 03:27.206
NO OFFENSE.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.739
ACTUALLY, OFFENSE.

03:29.740 --> 03:30.810
OKAY, SO TELL US

03:30.811 --> 03:32.742
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT
THIS COLLEGE OF LIFE.

03:32.743 --> 03:34.684
WELL, WE TALKED TO A
BUNCH OF COLLEGE KIDS.

03:34.685 --> 03:36.846
AND THEY SAID THAT
COLLEGE IS JUST A REALLY

03:36.847 --> 03:37.847
REALLY EXPENSIVE BEER
PONG TOURNAMENT.

03:37.848 --> 03:41.721
EXACTLY! WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO PASS THAT UP?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.994
SO INSTEAD OF WASTING OUR
TIME AND YOUR MONEY,

03:44.995 --> 03:46.996
WE'VE DECIDED TO DO THE
RESPONSIBLE THING...

03:46.997 --> 03:49.530
BUY A USED CAMPER VAN
AND TRAVEL THE COUNTRY.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.263
MY COUSIN'S SELLING IT
TO US FOR 500 BUCKS.

03:53.264 --> 03:56.306
IT'S IN GREAT CONDITION
EXCEPT FOR THE BREAKS.

03:56.307 --> 03:58.007
OH, SO YOU WILL BE
GOING NOWHERE FAST

03:58.008 --> 03:59.839
UNLESS YOU LUCKILY
RUN INTO A TREE.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.613
PERHAPS THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.

04:03.614 --> 04:05.975
WE'LL TAKE PART-TIME
JOBS HERE AND THERE.

04:05.976 --> 04:07.717
ZANDER WILL DRAW. I'LL WRITE.

04:07.718 --> 04:10.650
AND WE'LL JUST GROW
SO MUCH AS ARTISTS.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.881
OH MY GOD.

04:11.882 --> 04:14.854
OKAY, "GROWING," GOT IT.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.456
SO YOU'LL JUST TELL THE
COLLEGE OF YOUR CHOICE THAT

04:16.457 --> 04:18.528
YOU'RE TAKING A DEFERMENT AND
YOU'LL START NEXT FALL, RIGHT?

04:18.529 --> 04:21.461
OH, AUNT MEL, YOU KNOWS WHO'LL
I'LL EVEN BE IN A YEAR.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.863
OH, AND IF IT'S OKAY, CAN
ZANDER STAY FOR DINNER?

04:23.864 --> 04:27.497
'CAUSE WE JUST TOLD HIS PARENTS
AND THEY TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.

04:27.498 --> 04:28.838
THEY'RE NOT AS COOL AS YOU.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.940
VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE.

04:30.941 --> 04:32.742
YEAH, OF COURSE HE
CAN STAY FOR DINNER.

04:32.743 --> 04:34.644
AND WE CAN CELEBRATE
YOUR ACCEPTANCE...

04:34.645 --> 04:36.707
INTO THE VAN OF LIFE!

04:39.450 --> 04:40.680
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S JUST GREAT.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.281
SO LENNOX HAS BEEN
BUSTING HER ASS

04:42.282 --> 04:44.414
TO GET INTO A GOOD SCHOOL AND
NOW SHE'S JUST GONNA, WHAT?

04:44.415 --> 04:47.357
THROW THAT ALL AWAY TO BECOME
THE WORLD'S CUTEST HOBO?

04:47.358 --> 04:49.559
MAYBE SHE CAN MAKE HER
OWN CARDBOARD SIGNS.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.621
AND USE BIG S.A.T. WORDS LIKE

04:51.622 --> 04:53.763
"WILL TOIL FOR SUSTENANCE."

04:53.764 --> 04:56.796
JOE, MY GUIDING
PARENTING PRINCIPLE

04:56.797 --> 04:58.398
HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DO
THE EXACT OPPOSITE

04:58.399 --> 04:59.699
OF WHAT MY PARENTS DID.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.501
WHEN I ANNOUNCED THAT INSTEAD
OF GOING TO COLLEGE,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.333
I WAS GONNA FOLLOW
DEPECHE MODE FOR A YEAR,

05:03.334 --> 05:04.974
MY PARENTS CUT ME OFF.

05:04.975 --> 05:06.506
BUT YOU WENT TO COLLEGE.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.678
YES, BUT I HATED MY PARENTS.

05:08.679 --> 05:11.481
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA SHOW
SUPPORT FOR LENNOX'S DECISION.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.883
TRUST ME, AFTER A
COUPLE OF SHOWERS

05:13.884 --> 05:16.486
IN A TRUCK-STOP BATHROOM, SHE'S
GONNA COME CRAWLING BACK.

05:16.487 --> 05:18.718
YOU KNOW, READY TO BE CLEANED
UP FOR FALL SEMESTER.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.550
AND SHE WON'T HATE ME

05:20.551 --> 05:22.592
BECAUSE IT'S HER IDEA.

05:22.593 --> 05:24.093
YES, THE CORNER STONE
OF GREAT PARENTING,

05:24.094 --> 05:26.856
BEING LIKE BY KIDS
MAKING BAD DECISIONS.

05:26.857 --> 05:28.658
UH-HUH.

05:28.659 --> 05:30.400
I REALLY SHOULD WRITE A BOOK,

05:30.401 --> 05:32.763
"HOW TO BE RIGHT AND
PRETTY AT THE SAME TIME."

05:39.910 --> 05:41.511
YOU'RE STARING AT MY PIZZA.

05:41.512 --> 05:42.812
DO YOU WANT A BITE?

05:42.813 --> 05:45.475
YOU KNOW I CAN'T. I'VE BEEN
A VEGAN MY WHOLE LIFE.

05:45.476 --> 05:47.016
MY MOMS ARE SO VEGAN,
WHEN I WAS BORN,

05:47.017 --> 05:49.419
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
EAT THE PLACENTA.

05:49.420 --> 05:50.850
I'M GONNA PUT THE
REST OF THIS AWAY.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.752
NO DON'T!

05:51.753 --> 05:54.724
I MEAN ONE BITE WOULDN'T
HURT ME, RIGHT?

05:54.725 --> 05:56.626
YOU SURE YOUR
PARENTS WON'T MIND?

05:56.627 --> 05:59.128
MAYBE, BUT ACCORDING TO
MY GESTALT THERAPIST,

05:59.129 --> 06:00.530
I'M AT AN AGE WHERE I'M CURIOUS

06:00.531 --> 06:02.361
AND SHOULD BE EXPERIMENTING.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.863
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.536
IF YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT THIS...

06:11.041 --> 06:13.102
MMM.

06:13.103 --> 06:15.845
WELL, NOW I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

06:15.846 --> 06:17.848
SO I'M GONNA PUT THE
REST IN THE FRIDGE.

06:25.716 --> 06:27.588
MMM.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.993
OKAY, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.765
'CAUSE YOUR TONGUE
WASN'T IT'S NORMAL

06:35.766 --> 06:37.627
HAPPY SELF THERE.

06:37.628 --> 06:38.968
NO, MY TONGUE IS FINE.

06:38.969 --> 06:40.830
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING I
WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

06:40.831 --> 06:42.732
OH, HEY, IF IT'S THE NOISE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT

06:42.733 --> 06:45.775
BECAUSE I PUT IN SOUNDPROOFING.

06:45.776 --> 06:47.777
NO, IT'S NOT THAT EITHER,

06:47.778 --> 06:49.839
BUT GOOD TO KNOW.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.441
NO, IT'S JUST I'M
A LITTLE BEHIND

06:51.442 --> 06:53.182
ON MY PAYMENTS FOR
JEREMY'S TUTORING SESSIONS

06:53.183 --> 06:55.014
AND I FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT IT.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.686
AND TODAY I JUST
GOT THIS HUGE BILL

06:56.687 --> 06:58.087
FROM JEREMY'S ORTHODONTIST...

06:58.088 --> 06:59.789
GREAT CALL REMOVING THAT
EXTRA CANINE, BY THE WAY.

06:59.790 --> 07:02.792
IT WAS BEGINNING TO LOOK A
LITTLE LIKE SHARK WEEK.

07:02.793 --> 07:04.824
YEAH, HE GETS THAT FROM MY EX

07:04.825 --> 07:06.556
WHO, BY THE WAY, ISN'T
HELPING THE SITUATION.

07:06.557 --> 07:08.658
I'M JUST NOT SURE WHEN
I'M GONNA BE ABLE

07:08.659 --> 07:09.899
TO MAKE UP MY PAYMENTS TO YOU.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.801
CANDICE, HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:11.802 --> 07:13.062
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE MONEY.

07:13.063 --> 07:14.163
ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST
PAY ME WHEN YOU CAN.

07:14.164 --> 07:16.636
YOU ARE SO SWEET

07:16.637 --> 07:17.837
AND UNDERSTANDING.

07:17.838 --> 07:21.110
YUP, THAT'S ME, SWEET
AND UNDERSTANDING.

07:21.111 --> 07:22.742
AND ALSO ABLE TO BENCH PRESS

07:22.743 --> 07:24.214
TWICE MY BODY
WEIGHT, BY THE WAY.

07:27.918 --> 07:29.819
HEY, BLONDIE.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.150
HEY, IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR OUR ANNUAL TRIP

07:31.151 --> 07:32.882
TO THE TOLEDO BOOK FESTIVAL.

07:32.883 --> 07:35.054
AND I PROMISE, THIS YEAR I WON'T
DRESS UP LIKE KATNISS EVERDEEN.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.757
ALTHOUGH I WAS THE HOTTEST ONE.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.829
OKAY, SO CHECK OUT SOME
OF THESE SPEAKERS.

07:39.830 --> 07:41.791
THERE IS A MOTHER-DAUGHTER TEAM

07:41.792 --> 07:42.992
THAT WRITE ABOUT
VAMPIRE DETECTIVES.

07:42.993 --> 07:44.033
THEY'RE JUST LIKE US!

07:44.034 --> 07:45.635
EXCEPT THAT WE
DON'T WRITE NOVELS

07:45.636 --> 07:47.837
AND WE'RE NOT VAMPIRES. AND
WHY IS YOUR FACE LIKE THAT?

07:47.838 --> 07:50.069
"THANK YOU, LENNOX
SCANLON, FOR YOUR DEPOSIT.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.902
WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ON
THE OBERLIN CAMPUS THIS FALL."

07:52.903 --> 07:54.844
YOU TOLD THEM I WAS COMING.

07:54.845 --> 07:56.906
WELL, IN MY DEFENSE,

07:56.907 --> 07:58.508
YOU WERE NEVER
SUPPOSED TO SEE THAT!

07:58.509 --> 08:00.710
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE GONNA
COPY YOU ON THAT EMAIL.

08:00.711 --> 08:03.513
YOU PRETENDED YOU WERE COOL WITH
MY PLAN TO NOT GO TO COLLEGE.

08:03.514 --> 08:05.715
AND THEN YOU WENT BEHIND MY
BACK AND SIGNED ME UP ANYWAY.

08:05.716 --> 08:07.086
YOU WERE JUST PATRONIZING ME.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.818
OH SWEETIE, I WOULD
NEVER DO THAT

08:08.819 --> 08:10.620
TO MY BEAUTIFUL, SMART NIECE.

08:10.621 --> 08:11.891
ADMIT IT!

08:11.892 --> 08:14.123
REGISTERING ME FOR COLLEGE
BEHIND MY BACK WAS A BETRAYAL.

08:14.124 --> 08:16.896
NO, THIS WAS ABOUT
GIVING YOU OPTIONS,

08:16.897 --> 08:19.769
SOME INSURANCE IN CASE
YOUR ROCK-SOLID PLAN

08:19.770 --> 08:21.731
OF AIMLESSLY WANDERING
THE COUNTRY GOES AWRY,

08:21.732 --> 08:23.032
WHICH IT WON'T.

08:23.033 --> 08:25.575
CLEARLY, YOU DON'T TRUST ME
TO MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS.

08:25.576 --> 08:27.276
I'M GOING OUT.

08:27.277 --> 08:29.138
TAKE A JACKET...

08:29.139 --> 08:31.612
OR NOT. THESE ARE JUST OPTIONS!

08:40.721 --> 08:41.991
Ryder: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE'RE JUST

08:41.992 --> 08:43.853
IN THE MIDDLE OF A
BAD-ASS GAME OF JENGA.

08:43.854 --> 08:46.525
OH, I WAS JUST, UH,
LOOKING FOR SOME POPCORN.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.898
IN THE MEAT DRAWER?

08:48.959 --> 08:50.259
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.702
I HAD NO IDEA FOOD COULD
HAVE SO MUCH TASTE.

08:52.703 --> 08:56.305
EVER SINCE THE FIRST BITE,
IT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

08:56.306 --> 08:58.238
WELL, LET'S JUST MOVE YOU
AWAY FROM THE FRIDGE.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.872
YESTERDAY, ON THE WAY HOME
FROM FAMILY DRUM CIRCLE,

09:02.873 --> 09:04.774
WE PASSED A BILLBOARD
WHERE THIS GIRL

09:04.775 --> 09:07.046
IS EATING A BIG, MOIST HAMBURGER

09:07.047 --> 09:09.178
AND THE JUICES WERE
SPILLING DOWN HER CHIN.

09:09.179 --> 09:11.050
I CAN'T GET THE IMAGE
OUT OF MY HEAD.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.082
YEAH, I KNOW THAT
BILLBOARD WELL.

09:13.083 --> 09:16.186
AND THEN LAST NIGHT, I
HAD MY FIRST MEAT DREAM.

09:18.088 --> 09:19.860
I DIDN'T KNOW GIRLS HAD THOSE.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.263
RYDER, I NEED TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.166
WOULD YOU MAKE ME...

09:27.167 --> 09:28.267
A HAMBURGER?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.569
KEIRA, I DON'T...

09:30.570 --> 09:33.102
I DON'T KNOW IF I FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

09:33.103 --> 09:34.904
LOOK, IF I DON'T
GET IT FROM YOU,

09:34.905 --> 09:36.105
I'LL GET IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

09:36.106 --> 09:38.107
Ryder: NO, YOUR FIRST TIME

09:38.108 --> 09:40.009
SHOULD BE WITH SOMEONE WHO
REALLY CARES ABOUT YOU.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.712
THEN I WANT MY FIRST
TIME TO BE WITH YOU,

09:42.713 --> 09:44.654
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO GIVE IT TO ME,

09:44.655 --> 09:46.115
I GUESS I'LL JUST GET
IT FROM SOME STRANGER

09:46.116 --> 09:47.787
AT A FAST FOOD JOINT.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.989
OH! HEY! HI, GUYS.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.161
UM, LOOK, I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE TEENAGERS.

09:52.162 --> 09:54.023
YOUR BODIES ARE SAYING
"LET'S DO THIS THING,"

09:54.024 --> 09:55.194
BUT HONESTLY, YOU'RE
STILL TOO YOUNG.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.626
I'M 15.

09:56.627 --> 09:59.869
OKAY, THAT'S THE AGE
I WAS, BUT STILL...

09:59.870 --> 10:01.270
I'VE BEEN DOING IT
SINCE I HAD TEETH.

10:01.271 --> 10:03.032
WHAT?!

10:03.033 --> 10:05.004
EATING MEAT. I WAS GONNA
MAKE HER A HAMBURGER.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.135
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

10:06.136 --> 10:09.779
PFFT, THAT. OBVIOUSLY, THAT.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.981
I'VE BEEN A VEGAN MY WHOLE LIFE.

10:11.982 --> 10:14.784
AND RYDER GAME ME MY FIRST
LITTLE CIRCLE OF PEPPERONI.

10:14.785 --> 10:16.986
( fondly ) AH, THE GATEWAY MEAT.

10:16.987 --> 10:19.118
OOH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE BACON.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.850
IT COMES IN RECTANGLES.

10:20.851 --> 10:24.054
WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE TO TRY
BACON AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME.

10:26.997 --> 10:29.799
NOW, WHERE WERE WE MEAT-WISE?

10:29.800 --> 10:31.200
ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT
RUSH INTO THINGS.

10:31.201 --> 10:33.132
TOMORROW NIGHT, I'LL
MAKE YOU A HAMBURGER.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.233
JOE'S SPECIAL RECIPE.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.705
THANK YOU.

10:35.706 --> 10:37.006
BUT, LOOK, I WANT YOU
TO SLEEP ON IT, OKAY?

10:37.007 --> 10:38.107
MAKE SURE IT'S
REALLY WHAT YOU WANT

10:38.108 --> 10:40.339
BECAUSE ONCE YOU
EAT A HAMBURGER,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.972
YOU CANNOT UNEAT IT.

10:42.973 --> 10:45.915
SO AFTERNOONS ARE USUALLY
VERY BUSY FOR ME,

10:45.916 --> 10:47.016
BUT FOR A NEW CLIENT,

10:47.017 --> 10:49.018
I CAN BE FLEXIBLE, MRS.
SHERIDAN.

10:49.019 --> 10:51.881
MAGGIE... AND I LOST THE
"MRS" A FEW YEARS AGO.

10:51.882 --> 10:54.253
I JUST REALLY WANT MITCHELL
TO GET INTO A GOOD COLLEGE.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.355
BUT MY EX THINKS
TUTORING IS A WASTE.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.258
HE SAYS MITCHELL IS DESTINED FOR
A LIFE OF SCRUBBING TOILETS.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.230
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? NO
STUDENT OF JOE LONGO'S

11:01.231 --> 11:03.133
WILL EVER END UP CLEANING
OTHER PEOPLE'S BATHROOMS.

11:05.796 --> 11:07.837
UNLESS OF COURSE, THROUGH
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN,

11:07.838 --> 11:09.969
THEY END UP IN THE MIDDLE
OF A BIG FINANCIAL SCANDAL

11:09.970 --> 11:12.071
AND THEY LOSE EVERYTHING.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.173
ANYWAY, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT ME?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.745
OH, MY FRIEND CANDICE.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.676
SHE SAYS YOU WERE AMAZING.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.779
OH WELL, CANDICE IS A
VERY PERCEPTIVE WOMAN.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.011
SO LOOK, I BILL ON
A BIMONTHLY BASIS

11:22.012 --> 11:24.113
WITH A MINIMUM OF TWO
HOURS PER SESSION.

11:24.114 --> 11:25.955
WELL, ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING

11:25.956 --> 11:27.116
WE COULD WORK OUT THE SAME

11:27.117 --> 11:29.258
KIND OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PLAN

11:29.259 --> 11:30.960
THAT CANDICE HAS.

11:30.961 --> 11:32.461
WHAT PLAN IS THAT?

11:32.462 --> 11:34.824
YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE
CARE OF MITCHELL.

11:34.825 --> 11:36.727
I TAKE CARE OF YOU.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.999
IN FACT,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.472
I COULD GIVE YOU AN
ADVANCE RIGHT NOW.

11:43.433 --> 11:46.235
HEY, SORRY TO... WOW! OKAY.

11:46.236 --> 11:48.477
YOU SHOULD REALLY PUT A TIE
ON THE DOORKNOB OR SOMETHING.

11:48.478 --> 11:50.139
NO, NO, NO, NO. COME ON IN.
COME ON IN.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.011
ACTUALLY, MAGGIE
WAS JUST LEAVING

11:52.012 --> 11:53.112
- AT THIS VERY MOMENT.
- OH, OKAY.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.144
- GO, GO, GO, GO.
- OKAY, LET ME KNOW

11:55.145 --> 11:57.016
WHEN YOU DECIDE ON
A PAYMENT PLAN...

11:57.017 --> 11:59.288
- OKAY.
- AND IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL REQUESTS.

11:59.289 --> 12:02.321
I GOT IT! THANK YOU. OKAY.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.894
THIS REALLY IS A
FULL-SERVICE BUSINESS.

12:04.895 --> 12:06.225
WHAT'S YOUR SLOGAN?

12:06.226 --> 12:09.959
"RAISING CHILDREN'S GRADES AND
MOTHER'S SKIRTS SINCE 2013?"

12:09.960 --> 12:14.033
LOOK, IT WAS A BIG
MISUNDERSTANDING, OKAY?

12:14.034 --> 12:16.035
I MEAN, YOU KNOW... (
nervous laughter )

12:16.036 --> 12:17.036
MAGGIE'S FRIENDS WITH CANDICE

12:17.037 --> 12:18.768
AND THEY GOT TO TALKING.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.339
SOMEHOW, MAGGIE GOT
THE CRAZY IDEA

12:20.340 --> 12:22.772
THAT I TAKE ROMANCE
FOR TUTORING.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.144
WELL, I JUST CAME DOWN HERE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS DRAMA WITH LENNOX,

12:25.145 --> 12:26.846
BUT THIS IS WAY BETTER.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.048
SO WHAT EXACTLY DID CANDICE SAY

12:29.049 --> 12:30.219
TO GIVE MAGGIE THAT NUTTY IDEA?

12:30.220 --> 12:31.480
I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:31.481 --> 12:33.953
THE OTHER DAY I WAS
HANGING OUT WITH CANDICE.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.255
AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA
HAVE A TOUGH TIME PAYING ME.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.028
AND I SAID, LOOK, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE MONEY FOR NOW.

12:39.029 --> 12:40.960
AND THEN YOU HAD SEX?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.462
WELL, YEAH.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.935
OH MY GOD. SHE THINKS
I'M A PROSTITUTE.

12:45.936 --> 12:49.068
NO. NO, TECHNICALLY, SHE'S THE PROSTITUTE.
YOU'RE THE JOHN.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.269
WHAT? HOW?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.142
BECAUSE YOU PAID FOR SEX
WITH TUTORING LESSONS.

12:53.143 --> 12:57.076
BUT I DON'T WANT SEX.
I JUST WANT CASH.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.277
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
GETTING SCREWED

12:58.278 --> 13:01.280
BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING
ALL SEX AND NO CASH.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.252
BUT, HEY, CONGRATS, YOU'RE
A BUSINESSMAN AGAIN

13:03.253 --> 13:05.254
IN THE WORLD'S
OLDEST PROFESSION.

13:05.255 --> 13:07.817
THE GOOD NEWS IS NOBODY
CAN OUTSOURCE BOOTY.

13:07.818 --> 13:10.789
HEY, THERE IS NO PROSTITUTION
GOING ON HERE, ALL RIGHT?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.161
LOOK, MAGGIE JUST GOT THE
WRONG IDEA FROM CANDICE.

13:12.162 --> 13:14.063
YEAH, SURE SHE DID, SUGAR PECS.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.865
WILL YOU STOP THAT?

13:15.866 --> 13:17.997
I'M GONNA TALK TO CANDICE AND
FIGURE THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.198
GREAT, JUST MAKE SURE YOU DO IT

13:19.199 --> 13:20.870
AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN CARE
OF YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES

13:20.871 --> 13:23.002
LIKE DINNER. OH, AND DON'T
GET ANY CRAZY IDEAS.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.404
I'M PAYING YOU BY CHECK.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.107
ALL YOU'RE GETTING IS DINNER.

13:30.080 --> 13:34.013
LOOK AT THIS, MY NEPHEW AND
MY VERY FAVORITE NIECE.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.084
HEY.

13:35.085 --> 13:37.016
HEY, HOW YOU DOING
TODAY, SWEETIE?

13:37.017 --> 13:38.187
OH, SHE'S NOT TALKING TO YOU.

13:38.188 --> 13:40.020
THANKS. I PIECED THAT TOGETHER.

13:41.852 --> 13:43.452
CAN YOU JUST TELL HER I WAS
TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR HER,

13:43.453 --> 13:45.454
WHICH IS WHAT PARENTS
AND GUARDIANS DO.

13:45.455 --> 13:47.826
MAYBE YOU DON'T FULLY
APPRECIATE THAT RIGHT NOW,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.060
BUT LATER ON WHEN
I'M DEAD, YOU WILL.

13:52.402 --> 13:54.034
SHE LIKES THE DEAD PART.

13:55.165 --> 13:56.505
( knocking )

13:56.506 --> 13:58.567
ZANDER, HEY.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.309
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. COME ON IN.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.111
UH, THANKS. GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.013
HEY, BABE, CAN WE
SPEAK IN PRIVATE?

14:04.014 --> 14:06.615
SURE, LOYAL PERSON WHO
HAS NOT BETRAYED ME

14:06.616 --> 14:08.548
WHOM I TRUST MORE
THAN MY OWN FAMILY!

14:11.121 --> 14:14.483
WOW, I HAVE NOT SEEN
SUCH HOSTILITY SINCE...

14:14.484 --> 14:17.957
I LAST TALKED TO MY MOTHER.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.189
OKAY, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:20.190 --> 14:22.391
HERE'S THE DEAL. THIS IS IT.

14:22.392 --> 14:24.194
I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT OUT THERE.

14:26.937 --> 14:27.967
THE THING IS IT'S COMPLICATED.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.068
SAY IT.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.100
REMEMBER HOW MY DAD
WASN'T TALKING TO ME

14:31.101 --> 14:34.343
AFTER WE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE
WHOLE YEAR ON THE ROAD IDEA?

14:34.344 --> 14:36.145
UH-HUH.

14:36.146 --> 14:38.908
HE'S TALKING NOW...
YELLING REALLY.

14:38.909 --> 14:40.079
BUT, UH,

14:40.080 --> 14:41.510
HE SAID IF I DON'T
GO TO COLLEGE,

14:41.511 --> 14:43.212
HE'S GONNA CUT ME
OFF COMPLETELY,

14:43.213 --> 14:45.114
BUT IF I DO GO, HE'S
GONNA PAY FOR EVERYTHING

14:45.115 --> 14:47.016
INCLUDING ALL MY ART SUPPLIES.

14:47.017 --> 14:49.418
AND I GO THROUGH A
CRAP-LOAD OF PAPER.

14:49.419 --> 14:52.191
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
ARE YOU BAILING ON ME?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.223
LENNOX, I WANT TO BE AN ARTIST.

14:54.224 --> 14:56.125
GOING TO ART SCHOOL IS
A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT.

14:56.126 --> 14:59.268
BUT WE WERE A TEAM.
WHAT ABOUT OUR PLAN?

14:59.269 --> 15:00.269
WELL, YOU CAN STILL GO.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.371
ARE YOU CRAZY? A
17-YEAR-OLD GIRL

15:02.372 --> 15:04.133
DRIVING ACROSS THE
COUNTRY BY HERSELF?

15:04.134 --> 15:06.206
WHY DON'T I SAVE TIME AND
BURY MYSELF IN A DITCH?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.578
BABE, IT'S ONE TRIP.

15:09.579 --> 15:11.640
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
BAILING ON THE TRIP.

15:11.641 --> 15:14.243
THIS IS ABOUT BAILING ON
OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP.

15:14.244 --> 15:16.315
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.218
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
YOU ALREADY DID.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.360
JUST THE WAY JOE MAKES IT.

15:31.361 --> 15:33.362
IT'S GOT PORK,
LAMB, BEEF, BISON,

15:33.363 --> 15:35.534
AND JUST A HINT OF OSTRICH.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.307
IT'S LIKE MY MOUTH IS TAKING
A YUMMY TRIP TO THE ZOO.

15:38.308 --> 15:40.269
I FEEL SO GOOD AND STRONG

15:40.270 --> 15:43.412
LIKE I COULD LIFT A CAR.

15:43.413 --> 15:44.513
THAT'D BE THE BISON KICKING IN.

15:44.514 --> 15:46.615
OH, OH.

15:46.616 --> 15:48.217
THAT'S JOE'S NOAH'S ARK BURGER.

15:48.218 --> 15:49.979
I'D KNOW THAT SMELL IN MY SLEEP.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.281
GEEZ LOUISE, THIS IS BETTER
THAN CHORAL SINGING.

15:52.282 --> 15:54.553
OH, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY TAKE IT EASY.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.286
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME AND IT MIGHT BE
TOO MUCH FOR YOUR BODY TO HANDLE.

15:57.287 --> 15:58.627
BUT I FEEL FANTASTIC.

15:58.628 --> 15:59.728
OH, HERE'S A NAPKIN.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.330
- YOU GOT A LITTLE...
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

16:01.331 --> 16:02.532
NO, SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE THE
GIRL ON THE BILLBOARD...

16:06.296 --> 16:08.568
ONLY BETTER AND IN MY HOUSE.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.741
( gurgling ) UH-OH.

16:12.742 --> 16:14.203
YOU OKAY?

16:14.204 --> 16:15.704
I THINK THE ANIMALS
ARE RISING UP.

16:15.705 --> 16:17.376
( gurgles )

16:17.377 --> 16:19.248
YUP, YUP. STAMPEDE!

16:19.249 --> 16:20.279
I NEED A BATHROOM.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.450
OKAY, FOLLOW ME.
QUICK, THIS WAY.

16:21.451 --> 16:22.511
THIS WAY. THIS WAY. THIS WAY.

16:22.512 --> 16:24.053
DON'T FORGET TO
HOLD HER HAIR BACK.

16:24.054 --> 16:26.416
I WONDER IF THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.319
OH, WHAT THE HELL?

16:31.261 --> 16:33.122
( giggles )

16:33.123 --> 16:34.423
( chuckles ) WHOO.

16:34.424 --> 16:35.295
IS THAT A NEW TOP?

16:35.296 --> 16:37.066
YEAH, YOU LIKE IT?
I WENT ON A BIT OF

16:37.067 --> 16:38.597
A SHOPPING SPREE THE OTHER DAY.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.370
YOU DID? OH MY GOODNESS.

16:41.371 --> 16:43.033
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW...

16:44.274 --> 16:46.075
SPEAKING OF SPENDING MONEY,

16:46.076 --> 16:47.336
I THINK NOW MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE A GOOD TIME

16:47.337 --> 16:49.538
IF WE HAVE A LITTLE CHAT
ABOUT THE SPECIFICS

16:49.539 --> 16:52.111
OF THE PAYMENT PLAN
FOR ALL THE TUTORING.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.213
OH NO. WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.514
THIS IS WAY MORE FUN.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.417
YEAH, NO, IT IS.
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.219
BUT I THINK NOW WOULD
ACTUALLY BE THE PERFECT TIME

17:00.220 --> 17:05.154
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA HAVE SEX
WITH YOU UNTIL YOU PAY ME.

17:05.155 --> 17:07.456
WHAT ARE YOU, A HOOKER?

17:07.457 --> 17:09.328
( laughing )

17:09.329 --> 17:10.529
THAT IS A VERY EASY
MISTAKE TO MAKE.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.700
NO, TECHNICALLY,

17:11.701 --> 17:13.232
I'M THE JOHN. YOU'RE THE HOOKER.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.433
- WHAT?
- NO, NO, NO.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.804
NO ONE'S ACTUALLY
THE HOOKER THOUGH.

17:15.805 --> 17:18.467
SEE, IT'S ALL JUST HOW IT LOOKS.

17:18.468 --> 17:20.309
OKAY, THE OTHER DAY,

17:20.310 --> 17:21.770
YOUR FRIEND MAGGIE
CAME OVER HERE.

17:21.771 --> 17:24.773
SHE ASKED ME FOR THE
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PLAN.

17:24.774 --> 17:26.345
SOMEHOW SHE GOT THIS CRAZY IDEA

17:26.346 --> 17:29.818
THAT I HAVE THIS WHOLE
SEX-FOR-TUTORING THING GOING ON HERE.

17:29.819 --> 17:32.351
COULD YOU HAVE ACCIDENTLY
TOLD HER THAT?

17:32.352 --> 17:35.284
I TOLD HER THAT I WAS
DEFERRING PAYMENTS.

17:35.285 --> 17:38.487
OH, DEFERRING PAYMENTS, OKAY.

17:38.488 --> 17:39.688
BUT YOU ARE GONNA PAY ME, RIGHT?

17:39.689 --> 17:41.690
BECAUSE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

17:41.691 --> 17:43.562
YOU JUST BOUGHT YOURSELF
A BRAND-NEW BLOUSE.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.334
AND I'M ASSUMING THAT
YOU DIDN'T GET THAT

17:45.335 --> 17:48.837
USING THE ALTERNATIVE
PAYMENT PLAN.

17:48.838 --> 17:50.599
EXCUSE ME?

17:50.600 --> 17:52.841
- THAT CAME OUT SO BAD.
- YEAH, IT DID.

17:52.842 --> 17:54.273
THAT ACTUALLY CAME
OUT WORSE THAN BAD.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.075
I'M... I'M SO SORRY.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.407
IT'S JUST BEEN SO CONFUSING

17:58.408 --> 17:59.848
WITH ALL THE TALK
ABOUT MONEY, AND SEX,

17:59.849 --> 18:01.480
AND TUTORING.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.212
IT'S HARD TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:03.213 --> 18:04.513
I THINK THIS SHOULD COVER IT.

18:04.514 --> 18:06.285
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.456
I ALMOST FORGOT.

18:07.457 --> 18:10.419
HERE'S A LITTLE TIP FOR
YOUR EXTRA SERVICES.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.361
NO, NO, NO, HONEY.

18:12.362 --> 18:14.823
CANDICE, LISTEN, IT'S
REALLY NOT HOW IT SEEMS.

18:14.824 --> 18:18.267
I REALLY DO LIKE YOU. CAN
WE JUST TALK ABOUT IT?

18:18.268 --> 18:20.270
A DOLLAR, SERIOUSLY?

18:22.302 --> 18:26.735
WOW, APPARENTLY YOU
CAN UNEAT A BURGER.

18:26.736 --> 18:28.407
I FEEL SO STUPID.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.139
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
COULDN'T HOLD MY MEAT.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.441
OH NO, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

18:32.442 --> 18:34.683
IT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF
PEOPLE THEIR FIRST TIME.

18:34.684 --> 18:36.585
OF COURSE, FOR MOST PEOPLE,

18:36.586 --> 18:39.548
THEIR FIRST TIME IS WHEN
THEY'RE A YEAR OLD.

18:39.549 --> 18:41.320
LET'S JUST TAKE IT
SLOW FROM NOW ON.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.323
YOU KNOW? LIKE ONE
ANIMAL AT A TIME.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.695
SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN
A WHOLE PHYLUM.

18:46.696 --> 18:48.358
THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.502
LET'S GET YOU SOME SPELT TOAST

18:53.503 --> 18:55.435
AND MAYBE SOME MOUTHWASH.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.767
( knocking )

18:58.768 --> 19:01.410
PIECE OFFERING, COMING THROUGH.

19:01.411 --> 19:02.541
SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE SPENDING

19:02.542 --> 19:05.244
A LOT OF TIME IN THE VAN,
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE

19:05.245 --> 19:07.446
A DELUXE SET OF DAYS-OF-THE-WEEK
AIR FRESHENERS.

19:07.447 --> 19:10.519
MONDAY IS PINE. ( sniffs )

19:10.520 --> 19:12.321
TUESDAY IS BANANA,

19:12.322 --> 19:14.583
WHICH I WOULD SKIP, PERSONALLY.

19:14.584 --> 19:16.225
THANKS.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.387
LENNOX, I'M SO SORRY I
WENT BEHIND YOUR BACK.

19:18.388 --> 19:20.329
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I
DON'T TRUST YOU.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.461
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE GROWING UP.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.663
AND I CAN'T ALWAYS BE
THERE TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.165
THE WORLD IS A SCARY
PLACE WITH SCARY PEOPLE.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.798
AND BOYFRIENDS WHO TOTALLY BAIL
ON YOU AT THE LAST MINUTE.

19:29.799 --> 19:31.169
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.302
ZANDER'S GOING TO COLLEGE.

19:33.303 --> 19:34.473
HIS DAD BOUGHT HIM OFF

19:34.474 --> 19:36.675
WITH PAINTBRUSHES AND
A BOX OF CRAYONS.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.747
OH, SWEETIE.

19:38.748 --> 19:40.349
WILL YOU GO TO COLLEGE NOW TOO?

19:40.350 --> 19:41.950
I MEAN, WHATEVER, I DON'T CARE.

19:41.951 --> 19:45.384
I CAN PEEL THE OBERLIN
STICKER OFF MY CAR.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.655
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO,

19:46.656 --> 19:48.317
BUT DO I HAVE TO
DECIDE RIGHT NOW?

19:48.318 --> 19:50.319
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.960
IT'S YOUR LIFE AND
YOUR DECISION.

19:51.961 --> 19:54.192
AND I'M REALLY
STARTING TO MEAN THAT.

19:54.193 --> 19:58.367
SO SPEAKING OF YOUR LIFE,
IS ZANDER STILL IN IT?

19:58.368 --> 20:00.369
I'M UNDECIDED ABOUT HIM TOO.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.301
IT'S OKAY TO BE UNDECIDED.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.273
I'M UNDECIDED ABOUT
A LOT OF STUFF

20:04.274 --> 20:05.534
LIKE SHOULD I GO HONEY BLONDE,

20:05.535 --> 20:07.676
OR STRAWBERRY BLONDE,
OR FIRECRACKER RED?

20:07.677 --> 20:08.937
WHAT'S YOUR NATURAL COLOR?

20:08.938 --> 20:10.640
OH, SWEETIE, WHO KNOWS?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.916
SO AT LEAST ONE THING'S
BEEN DECIDED FOR CERTAIN.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.218
LENNOX AND ZANDER MAY OR MAY NOT

20:20.219 --> 20:21.290
STILL BE TOGETHER.

20:21.291 --> 20:22.651
I'M JUST HAPPY THAT
MY PRECIOUS LENNOX

20:22.652 --> 20:23.792
IS NOT GONNA BE TRAVELLING
AROUND THE COUNTRY

20:23.793 --> 20:25.654
IN THAT ROLLING TUNA CAN.

20:25.655 --> 20:27.956
WHAT SHE GOING TO BE DOING
FOR THE NEXT YEAR, ANYWAY?

20:27.957 --> 20:29.528
UH, WHO KNOWS? IT'LL
BE A WONDERFUL

20:29.529 --> 20:31.300
SURPRISE FOR ALL OF US.

20:31.301 --> 20:33.662
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT
ARE WE CELEBRATING?

20:33.663 --> 20:35.304
THAT WE HAVE WINE.

20:35.305 --> 20:38.267
RAISING CHILDREN
REALLY CHANGES YOU.

20:38.268 --> 20:40.008
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WENT
BEHIND LENNOX'S BACK

20:40.009 --> 20:41.540
TO TRY TO GET HER
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.771
I KNOW, IMAGINE
THAT, A POLITICIAN

20:42.772 --> 20:45.314
GOING BEHIND SOMEONE'S BACK.
I AM SHOCKED.

20:45.315 --> 20:46.615
I'M SERIOUS.

20:46.616 --> 20:48.817
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO
DO LIKE ANY GOOD PARENT.

20:48.818 --> 20:50.819
TAKE MAGGIE. SHE WAS
WILLING TO SLEEP WITH ME

20:50.820 --> 20:52.281
TO GET TUTORING FOR HER KID.

20:52.282 --> 20:54.453
PARENTS WILL DO ALMOST
ANYTHING FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.355
ANYTHING.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.587
YEAH, I DON'T SEE
A LINE OF PARENTS

20:58.588 --> 20:59.828
WAITING OUTSIDE TO
PAY YOU FOR SEX.

20:59.829 --> 21:02.260
OKAY, FOR THE LAST TIME,
NO ONE WAS PAYING YOU.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.793
YOU WERE PAYING THEM FOR SEX.

21:05.495 --> 21:06.965
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU TWO.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.567
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
- IT'S VERY INNOCENT.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.668
THERE WAS HALF A BURGER HERE!

21:09.669 --> 21:11.000
WHO TOOK IT?

21:12.572 --> 21:14.273
GUESS HOW JOE GET'S
PAID FOR TUTORING.
