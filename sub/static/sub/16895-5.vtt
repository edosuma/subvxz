WEBVTT

01:15.909 --> 01:18.453
WOMAN: How's he gonna improve
when you always stick him on the bench?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.079
I don't always stick him
on the bench.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.331
Not once
have you made him a starting player.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.335
And he's got the quality to start.
He was a JV powerhouse.

01:26.503 --> 01:30.047
This isn't JV. No offense, ma'am,
but Lamar is a sophomore.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.883
I think he's got a great shot, but...

01:32.050 --> 01:34.844
His brother was the same way.
You didn't want him to start...

01:35.012 --> 01:38.181
...and then I had to nag and nag you,
and then you did.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.349
- If he hadn't broken his leg...
- Excuse me...

01:40.517 --> 01:43.311
...but we're gonna have
to continue this conversation later.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.188
Thanks for your interest.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.734
Need some help?

01:49.902 --> 01:53.029
JEMMA: No, not really. I know how to do it.
Thanks, though.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.072
I mean...

01:56.241 --> 01:58.993
...not unless you're some sort of expert.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.871
I'm not an expert,
but I'd be glad to help you.

02:02.039 --> 02:05.291
No fun to be changing a tire
out in the rain, right?

02:07.711 --> 02:09.754
JEMMA:
Do you like rescuing damsels in distress?

02:11.340 --> 02:13.424
This is my first time.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.719
Hm. So why did you stop?

02:16.887 --> 02:21.390
If you were some fat-ass truck driver,
I might have kept driving.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.393
I think there's a compliment
deep in there somewhere.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.270
RAY:
Yeah.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.689
Yeah, there probably is.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.483
Okay.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.070
You hungry?

02:34.238 --> 02:37.990
There's a little cafÃ© up the road.
You wanna get some lunch?

02:47.751 --> 02:49.919
JEMMA:
Oh, God!

03:03.100 --> 03:05.268
She didn't like it.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.062
- What do you mean?
- She didn't like it so much.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.231
What? You know what this is?

03:10.399 --> 03:12.692
This is like when you go
to a restaurant, eat...

03:12.860 --> 03:15.236
...and then you pretend
there's a hair in the food.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.613
Can't hit a home run every time.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.992
Nobody else complained.
They think I've done a fucking excellent job.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.453
Would you try to understand the customer?
The customer is always first.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.622
Lenore said this woman has had a string...

03:26.790 --> 03:28.958
...of really bad relationships.
- So?

03:29.126 --> 03:32.211
So what happened
was more of a male fantasy...

03:32.379 --> 03:35.798
...and what she wanted
was more of a female fantasy.

03:37.175 --> 03:41.220
- More female?
- Yeah, well, that's the way it goes.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.390
- She's our third customer.
- I thought I was supposed to fuck her.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.976
Next time, make her feel
like it's about her mind...

03:47.144 --> 03:48.811
...not just her body.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.897
She wants to book me again?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.149
Yeah, she wants a rewrite.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.151
She'll pay for it.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.403
You mean a do-over?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.659
You need any help?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.745
Not really.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.250
I mean, unless you're an expert.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.628
You know, I realize...

04:14.504 --> 04:19.008
...I don't even know your name.
- Jemma. Yours?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.344
- Randall.
- Randall.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.180
And do you have a career or a job?

04:24.348 --> 04:27.516
- I'm gonna guess a career.
- Yeah, that's right, a career.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.936
What kind of career?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.229
I'm a book editor.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.359
Really? I was a comparative-lit. Major.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.694
What kind of books?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.240
Good books.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.578
I go for quality.
I don't give a shit if it's a bestseller.

04:47.746 --> 04:51.874
I go for the kind of arty books
that move readers.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.043
That's great, Randall. I really...

04:54.211 --> 04:56.712
I really admire people like you.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.548
I'm a total sellout.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.968
I work for an ad department.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.805
But, you know, at least I get
to meet people like you...

05:05.973 --> 05:07.390
...who follow their dreams.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.059
Do you wanna go to a movie sometime?

05:15.565 --> 05:16.983
Thank you.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.861
Part of me would love to,
but I do have a boyfriend.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.617
- A boyfriend?
- Yeah.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.411
I should go meet him now.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.247
- What do you mean? Now?
- Actually, it is now. I'm sorry.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.124
It's...

05:33.291 --> 05:36.293
It was so great to meet you.

05:36.962 --> 05:41.173
- Yeah.
- Thanks for fixing my flat. That was sweet.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.842
My pleasure.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.178
She said she has a boyfriend.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.597
He probably doesn't exist.
Don't you get it?

05:48.765 --> 05:51.642
She has a bruised heart.
That's what she said in the interview.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.686
- Men let her down.
- Women let me down.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.689
But we're not talking about you.
You're not paying.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.275
She wanted to meet you
by the side of the road.

05:59.443 --> 06:03.529
But my guess is,
she was looking for a connection...

06:04.072 --> 06:05.448
...at least for a few moments.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.534
The fantasy of meeting a total stranger...

06:08.702 --> 06:13.039
...and wondering if it might be destiny.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.043
God, you were supposed to stop her
from leaving, Ray.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.297
- Barf.
- Could you stop snorting with derision?

06:21.465 --> 06:24.884
Fine, I'll pretend I'm madly
in love with this freak.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.054
You might not get another chance.
She might not call again.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.141
Okay, fine. It's no skin off our back.
We'll find somebody else.

06:32.309 --> 06:36.437
We don't have anyone else yet.
And Jemma pays great.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.689
RAY:
That was the thing about Jemma:

06:38.857 --> 06:40.900
She paid great.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.320
DAMON: Why did Ronnie choose this place?
It's really dingy.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.363
JESSICA:
What's wrong with a delicious buffet?

06:46.531 --> 06:47.656
That's not crab.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.826
It's imitation crab.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.036
I prefer it.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.371
It's cleaner and healthier.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.041
- Safer for the environment.
- Is the shrimp real?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.835
There's no such thing
as fake shrimp, Darb.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.506
- Here. Just eat it. You'll like it.
- Mom, even the hush puppies suck.

07:03.673 --> 07:07.009
- Something wrong?
- Nothing, Ron.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.346
Just blah, blah, blah
from the peanut gallery.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.185
That's a swan.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.980
Here's the thing, kids.
We're not made of money anymore.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.024
Oh, well, it's not that big of a deal.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.860
It just means
that sometimes we eat at the steakhouse...

07:25.028 --> 07:28.364
...and other times at the $3.99 buffet.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.116
- We shake it up.
RONNIE: No more luxuries.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.868
- That's what we're trying to say.
- Important luxuries...

07:33.036 --> 07:35.955
...ones that really matter, those we keep.

07:36.123 --> 07:40.209
- So you're not rich anymore?
- Correct.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.545
Come on, Ronnie.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.548
We're still rich. We're just not as rich.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.385
Point is, we don't feel as rich.
Not super rich like before.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.179
But you still have some money?

07:52.347 --> 07:55.891
We lost a lot of money
in the stock market.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.145
Times are tough. We just happened
to land in the danger zone.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.898
Okay, but we don't have to call it
the danger zone. It's a temporary setback.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.943
Besides, all that money
was on paper anyway.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.905
- So it's all in your mind?
- I wish.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.242
Which brings us to the car.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.581
RAY: It's not that I wanted
to compete with Jessica...

08:18.748 --> 08:22.459
...or benefit from her misfortune,
but I had a little extra money for once.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.880
Not a whole lot, but enough
to hire a couple of guys to help me out...

08:26.047 --> 08:29.425
...and for a couple
of quality T-bone steaks.

08:29.593 --> 08:33.304
Twenty bucks each, and I didn't
give a crap. Damn straight.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.182
RAY: Darby, darling.
- Thank you.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.602
Go on, tell us how it is, Darb.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.270
- All right, Damon.
- Thank you.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.856
Here you go, pal.
All right, how's the steak?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.525
- Cooked them pretty good, huh?
DAMON: It's good, Dad.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.444
RAY:
So...

08:49.946 --> 08:51.697
...Ronnie lost a lot of money, huh?

08:51.865 --> 08:52.990
That's what he says.

08:53.158 --> 08:56.202
Boy, your mom
must be real disappointed.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.621
Yeah.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.373
Ronnie was a real rock.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.085
Who would have guessed?

09:05.253 --> 09:08.631
DARBY: Yeah, well,
he's not gonna buy us a car anymore.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.007
DAMON:
What do you care?

09:10.175 --> 09:12.509
Why don't you just get Hammer
to drive you around?

09:12.969 --> 09:15.221
Damon, why are you so up his butt?

09:16.348 --> 09:18.057
RAY:
When the kids brought up the car...

09:18.225 --> 09:21.769
...I don't know, maybe it was the divorce,
or maybe I was just a jackass.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.356
I felt bold. The twins were turning 16.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.982
You know...

09:27.150 --> 09:30.110
...just because Ronnie can't buy you
a car doesn't mean I can't.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.284
We gotta up our game, Tanya.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.995
If she doesn't love it next time,
I'll do her for free.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.374
Now that I know what she wants,
I'll deliver. Satisfaction guaranteed.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.001
TANYA: I don't think you're capable
of understanding her.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.671
Jemma strikes me as highly complex.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.048
I just promised my kids a car.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.759
You just leave
all that highly-complex stuff to me.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.762
TANYA:
This is my version of a preacher cookie.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.015
Preacher cookies get their name
from the idea...

10:00.183 --> 10:04.103
...that if a preacher knocks
on your door unexpectedly...

10:04.271 --> 10:06.230
...you can cook these up
in a few minutes.

10:06.398 --> 10:13.362
And my inspiration was to put a little piece
of psalm inside each one.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.448
Maybe to attract a church market.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.201
Well, it certainly is generous of Tanya...

10:19.369 --> 10:21.912
...to host our gathering
and bake us a sample, isn't it?

10:23.290 --> 10:26.542
Does anyone else have a final prototype
they'd like to share?

10:28.878 --> 10:32.548
Well, if you'd like to e-mail me,
I'm always available for commentary.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.385
And even though our class
is officially ending...

10:36.553 --> 10:40.264
...perhaps some of you are ready
for the next step.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.267
That's right.
If you are ready to believe in yourself...

10:43.435 --> 10:46.020
...and your abilities
on a whole new level...

10:46.187 --> 10:51.859
...it's time to sign up
for How to Become a Millionaire part two.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.279
Now, who's ready to take that step?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.072
Who has the courage?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.870
Raise your hand
if you want an application.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.584
When you've been in the business
of money creation...

11:08.752 --> 11:11.337
...for as long as I have, Tanya,
nothing is surprising.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.256
Some people don't have mental fortitude.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.258
It's as if their brain has polio...

11:16.426 --> 11:20.012
...and they're trapped
in an iron lung of the mind, see?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.764
They can't become millionaires.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.350
They can't get a fancy car like I have...

11:24.517 --> 11:28.520
...because, essentially,
they can't make the leap upstairs mentally.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.107
I think most people
wanted to take part two...

11:32.275 --> 11:34.777
...but they couldn't afford it.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.780
Why don't I have more students like you?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.450
What makes you so different,
Tanya Skagle?

11:41.618 --> 11:43.577
Why don't you ask my mother?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.120
[LAUGHING]

11:45.288 --> 11:46.914
TouchÃ©.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.293
- Now, do you have your checkbook?
- My checkbook?

11:51.461 --> 11:54.463
Yeah, I recommend you go ahead
and secure your space.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.550
Sometimes part two in particular
can fill up like a flash flood.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.677
My only hesitation is, I was thinking...

12:00.845 --> 12:04.014
...that I might wanna take part two
next time.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.935
Well, why ever
would you do that?

12:08.103 --> 12:11.939
Well, I wanna sign up,
it's just the class isn't cheap, right?

12:12.107 --> 12:14.358
Well, then why did you say,
"Count me in?"

12:15.819 --> 12:17.820
I was trying to be supportive.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.156
Well, swell. That'll be great. Yeah.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.242
It's not what I recommend, but...

12:23.410 --> 12:26.161
...you can lead a horse to water,
that sort of thing.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.582
Is your Jaguar a rental?

12:52.397 --> 12:54.148
Need any help?

12:54.816 --> 12:58.152
I don't give a rat's ass
if it's a bestseller, you know?

12:58.361 --> 13:02.865
That's just how I like to roll
with the books in my area.

13:03.658 --> 13:07.327
Well, that's beautiful, Randall.
I really admire people like you.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.874
You wanna go to a movie sometime?

13:13.376 --> 13:15.210
Um...

13:15.378 --> 13:19.047
A part of me would love to,
but I have a fiancÃ©.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.221
I should go meet him.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.725
Hey, can't he wait, this fiancÃ© of yours?

13:29.893 --> 13:32.060
No, he gets cranky if I'm late.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.104
You know, maybe I'm mistaken...

13:34.272 --> 13:39.485
...but I think you'd have a lot more fun
if you stayed here.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.945
