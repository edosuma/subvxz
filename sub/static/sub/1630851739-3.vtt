WEBVTT

00:26.375 --> 00:29.125
Ceylon black tea and jasmine green tea.
No sugar, no ice.

00:29.958 --> 00:30.958
Here are the straws.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.291
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.000
Chun-chieh.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.208
Can we talk right now?

00:44.958 --> 00:45.875
Are you sure?

00:50.958 --> 00:52.083
What should we do?

00:54.833 --> 00:57.041
You're asking me what to do now?

00:57.666 --> 00:58.625
Yes.

00:58.708 --> 00:59.708
What should we do?

01:00.250 --> 01:01.333
We are just students.

01:01.416 --> 01:02.833
How are we going to raise a child?

01:02.916 --> 01:04.333
I haven't served in the military yet.

01:04.416 --> 01:06.958
And I'm going abroad to study after that.

01:07.041 --> 01:08.333
It's the same for you.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.833
You'll intern for a record company
after you graduate, right?

01:11.916 --> 01:13.791
If you have a child now…

01:13.875 --> 01:14.791
What can we do?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.333
Do we have the money?

01:16.416 --> 01:17.750
How can we raise a child?

01:17.833 --> 01:19.750
If… What if…

01:24.041 --> 01:25.083
I was thinking

01:25.791 --> 01:27.333
we've been dating for almost a year.

01:28.916 --> 01:30.375
Maybe we should get married first?

01:40.291 --> 01:41.541
Can we

01:43.541 --> 01:44.958
not keep the baby?

01:57.125 --> 02:01.166
K&CREAM

02:07.083 --> 02:08.291
Ke-le.

02:09.250 --> 02:12.083
-An Yi-chi, you're so late.
-I'm sorry for making you wait.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.291
-I'm starving.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

02:14.375 --> 02:15.958
Sorry for making you wait.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.916
Let me kiss you. Why is your face so cold?

02:18.833 --> 02:19.791
And your hands too.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.208
Is the air conditioner too cold?

02:22.291 --> 02:24.083
-Did you have fun in class today?
-I did.

02:24.166 --> 02:25.416
Really? What did you do?

02:25.500 --> 02:26.416
Some drawings.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.916
What did you draw? Did you draw me?

02:28.000 --> 02:28.875
I won't tell you.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.375
Did you draw me?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.208
<i>Ms. An.</i>

02:33.041 --> 02:35.333
Ke-le has a complicated
congenital heart defect.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.708
When he was born,
his left ventricle wasn't fully developed.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.416
On top of that,
his pulmonary artery is too narrow.

02:42.625 --> 02:43.958
That's why I suggested it

02:44.041 --> 02:45.250
during your last appointment.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.291
Ke-le needs another surgery.

02:54.458 --> 02:55.916
But Dr. Hsieh,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.125
is surgery the only option?

02:58.208 --> 03:00.208
Ke-le has had four surgeries.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.625
He has scars all over his chest.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.416
-The chance of success is only 40%--
-I understand your concern.

03:05.291 --> 03:06.291
If possible,

03:06.875 --> 03:08.708
I don't want him to have
another surgery either.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.083
But his oxygen levels are dropping.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.166
It's possible that the pulmonary artery
has become narrower,

03:16.250 --> 03:17.458
causing pressure in the lungs to rise.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.875
If it ends up with heart failure,

03:22.541 --> 03:24.375
there could be less than a 40% chance.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.416
<i>Have you considered a different hospital?</i>

03:37.291 --> 03:38.875
Dr. Hsieh is a good doctor.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.041
And he's very caring.

03:41.125 --> 03:44.208
He got me an expert from abroad
to help Ke-le.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.041
It's just…

03:52.208 --> 03:54.541
Their evaluation

03:55.875 --> 03:57.000
was 40% at most.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.375
It's okay.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.375
We're used to it.

04:17.416 --> 04:19.250
Is the air conditioner too cold?

04:21.291 --> 04:24.583
Did your snooty boss drive you here again?

04:24.666 --> 04:26.041
Hey, don't be rude.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.000
He's Mr. Wang.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.208
Come on. Wave at him.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.291
Hi, Mr. Wang.

04:30.375 --> 04:31.708
Mr. Wang.

04:31.791 --> 04:33.000
Move your hand.

04:33.083 --> 04:35.083
Mr. Wang. Move your hand.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.708
-Little brat.
-Mr. Wang.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.708
<i>Can we really get used to sadness?</i>

04:50.666 --> 04:51.583
<i>Or are we</i>

04:52.250 --> 04:53.541
<i>just trying to hide it?</i>

04:53.625 --> 04:55.375
FOR SALE, PLEASE CONTACT MR. CHANG

04:55.458 --> 04:57.125
<i>And pretend it's not there?</i>

05:15.250 --> 05:17.166
Why did you spill the drink on me
this morning?

05:19.166 --> 05:21.166
You seemed
to be having a hard time running.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.708
Can't I treat you to a drink?

05:24.666 --> 05:26.375
I thought you were going to take
a few more days off.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.125
Are you okay?

05:29.416 --> 05:31.250
I'm almost done settling things.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.000
Let me know
if there's anything I can help with.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.666
This Sunday,
do you want to come to my house?

05:42.708 --> 05:43.583
What for?

05:45.291 --> 05:46.250
A party.

05:47.666 --> 05:48.625
What party?

05:49.333 --> 05:50.916
Just call some of your friends.

05:51.625 --> 05:53.250
There won't be any adults
in my house anyway.

05:56.875 --> 05:57.916
Hey, everyone.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.250
Do you want to come over on Sunday?

06:01.333 --> 06:02.541
My treat.

06:06.625 --> 06:07.916
Don't be shy.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.833
Sung Yuan-yuan, are you going?

06:26.708 --> 06:33.166
NO ADULTS. LET'S PARTY.

06:38.125 --> 06:44.041
FOR SALE, PLEASE CONTACT MR. CHANG

06:44.125 --> 06:45.250
Hurry up and eat, everyone.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.000
Che-kai hit the jackpot.

06:48.083 --> 06:48.958
Che-kai.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.875
How can you afford the food and drinks?

06:50.958 --> 06:53.166
-Let's celebrate that the adults are gone.
-Che-kai hit the jackpot.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.625
-Eat up, everyone. Don't be shy.
-Thank you, Che-kai.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.041
-Thank you, Che-kai.
-Thank you, Che-kai.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.000
Come on. Cheer up.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.333
-Cheers.
-Hey, wait for us.

06:59.416 --> 07:01.458
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

07:01.541 --> 07:02.666
-Here. Cheers.
-Thanks, Che-kai.

07:02.750 --> 07:03.916
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

07:10.916 --> 07:12.125
Right, Che-kai.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.125
This is Hsiao-ting,
a friend from my cram school.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.291
Hello.

07:16.375 --> 07:17.583
Hi.

07:17.666 --> 07:19.000
I heard you have a lot of CDs.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.291
I like music,
so I thought I'd come over here.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.916
Yes, my family runs a record shop.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.208
These are all CDs.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.291
This is amazing.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.000
What kind of songs do you like?

07:33.083 --> 07:34.541
I like

07:34.625 --> 07:36.000
Japanese pop music.

07:36.083 --> 07:38.166
Japanese pop music?

07:38.708 --> 07:41.083
Then, where can I find heavy metal?

07:45.375 --> 07:46.750
Why are you here?

07:46.833 --> 07:48.250
Japanese pop music.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.250
Come on, show me around.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.416
Hey!

07:52.500 --> 07:54.250
Just ignore her. She's always like that.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.083
You really have so many CDs.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.375
Yes.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.541
You're not really looking
for heavy metal, are you?

08:03.125 --> 08:04.375
What do you think?

08:10.083 --> 08:10.916
I think…

08:11.000 --> 08:12.291
I don't think so.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.541
So this is why you always
have your headphones with you.

08:15.416 --> 08:16.541
Have you listened to all of them?

08:17.208 --> 08:18.208
How is that possible?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.291
I just

08:20.375 --> 08:22.333
pick something I like.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.208
Why are you selling the house?

08:33.916 --> 08:36.166
Are you trying to pay me back?

08:37.791 --> 08:39.291
My aunt thought you would run away.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.875
She wanted to extort a fortune from you.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.541
That's not it.

08:47.583 --> 08:48.750
Well…

08:52.791 --> 08:55.000
This house is just too big

08:55.500 --> 08:56.916
for me to live alone.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.625
Where's your mom?

09:05.125 --> 09:06.833
She won't be back for a while.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.375
Hey.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.125
Why is this broken?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.416
Good choice.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.916
These are songs my dad and I both like.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.083
But we can't listen to it now.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.666
It's okay.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.958
Because I know every song on this album.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.458
I can sing them all.

10:14.041 --> 10:14.916
<i>Che-kai,</i>

10:16.500 --> 10:18.083
some things might break,

10:19.250 --> 10:20.625
they might disappear,

10:21.333 --> 10:23.375
but they'll exist in other forms.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.000
Right here.

10:30.416 --> 10:31.708
<i>You'll remember it forever.</i>

10:33.000 --> 10:34.333
<i>Right?</i>

10:54.750 --> 10:55.750
Hey.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.333
Yes?

10:58.833 --> 11:00.416
Let me tell you a secret.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.416
My birthday is coming soon.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.416
Your birthday?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.958
I want a birthday present.

11:09.833 --> 11:11.416
What present do you want?

11:13.375 --> 11:15.000
I'll tell you when I think of something.

11:51.666 --> 11:53.208
I'm here for my birthday present.

11:53.291 --> 11:54.166
What?

11:54.958 --> 11:56.666
What birthday present?

11:57.708 --> 11:59.916
Your house is my house from now on.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.541
Hold this for me.

12:03.750 --> 12:04.666
Hey.

12:14.708 --> 12:16.708
Hey, it's my birthday.

12:16.791 --> 12:18.250
Can you at least look happier?

12:22.541 --> 12:25.125
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:25.208 --> 12:27.666
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:27.750 --> 12:29.958
<i>-Happy birthday to--</i>
-Okay, that's enough.

12:30.041 --> 12:30.875
I'm making my wishes.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.000
My first wish…

12:36.083 --> 12:37.166
I wish for

12:37.250 --> 12:38.291
world peace.

12:44.750 --> 12:45.916
My second wish

12:46.000 --> 12:48.250
is for a good score on the exam.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.750
So I can get into a good college.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.000
You always get good grades.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.708
Of course you will get into
a good college.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.666
I'll give you my third wish.

13:02.750 --> 13:03.625
What?

13:04.708 --> 13:05.833
Give it to me?

13:07.708 --> 13:09.083
Hurry up.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.458
I want to eat the cake.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.458
Hey!

13:43.583 --> 13:45.333
Fine. It's just for me then.

13:47.416 --> 13:48.625
What did you wish for?

13:49.375 --> 13:51.166
If I tell you, it won't come true.

13:51.875 --> 13:52.708
You're so petty.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.708
You got your wish from me.

13:54.791 --> 13:55.833
I shouldn't have given it to you.

13:55.916 --> 13:57.041
Hey.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.250
Are you really moving in with me?

14:00.416 --> 14:02.083
Do I look like I'm joking?

14:03.625 --> 14:05.000
Is your aunt okay with this?

14:08.875 --> 14:10.416
From now on,

14:11.125 --> 14:13.583
I will be 18 years old, so I'm an adult.

14:13.666 --> 14:15.000
I can make my own decisions.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.333
Anyway, from now on, I'll pay my rent

14:18.416 --> 14:20.041
with the compensation you owe me.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.375
Understand?

14:24.875 --> 14:26.416
Focus on your studies.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.541
Stop thinking about the money.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.958
It's like I'm taking advantage of you.

14:38.416 --> 14:39.875
And we're even now.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.375
What?

15:00.625 --> 15:01.625
Hey.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.208
Don't wipe it off.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.333
Why?

15:08.875 --> 15:10.000
Because

15:10.083 --> 15:12.000
my English name is Cream.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.083
Do you like cream?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.125
That's a lot of calories.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.166
No.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.750
What I like to eat is ice cream.

15:23.583 --> 15:24.541
I see.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.708
That has even more calories.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.541
From now on,

15:35.708 --> 15:36.750
your name will be K.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.166
K?

15:38.708 --> 15:39.750
K is a nickname.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.125
It's not a name.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.625
I'll call you K anyway.

15:44.708 --> 15:45.791
That's your name.

15:46.750 --> 15:47.833
Why?

15:48.750 --> 15:51.625
Because I'm Cream and you're K.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.333
Our names have the same phonetic "k."

15:54.291 --> 15:56.416
Don't you think that sounds

15:57.125 --> 15:58.458
like a family?

16:02.333 --> 16:03.208
Family?

16:05.083 --> 16:06.083
Family.

16:06.708 --> 16:07.875
From now on,

16:08.541 --> 16:09.916
we are family.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.083
What?

16:27.166 --> 16:28.750
What are you staring at? Why?

16:28.833 --> 16:30.666
Is it that bad to have me as your family?

16:30.750 --> 16:31.791
-What?
-Don't poke me.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.416
-How? Don't…
<i>-That day, my wish was</i>

16:35.000 --> 16:37.833
<i>-for my family to come back to me.</i>
-…don't want to…

16:38.916 --> 16:40.208
<i>I didn't think that my wish</i>

16:40.291 --> 16:42.583
-…don't…
<i>-would be realized this way.</i>

16:48.166 --> 16:51.500
<i>After that, I started living with Cream.</i>

16:51.583 --> 16:52.541
Move!

16:55.500 --> 16:57.000
<i>We go to school together.</i>

16:57.791 --> 17:00.125
-Hurry, we're late.
<i>-We study together.</i>

17:00.208 --> 17:01.791
-Late…
<i>-Do our homework together.</i>

17:01.875 --> 17:03.166
Wait for me.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.541
<i>We laugh</i>

17:06.291 --> 17:07.708
<i>and cry together.</i>

17:19.041 --> 17:21.333
You stupid K. You didn't wait for me.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.291
Move.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.000
You made me hit my mouth.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.458
7 DAYS UNTIL THE EXAM

17:41.750 --> 17:43.500
It's done.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.500
COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM
CENTRAL SUBJECT APTITUDE TEST

17:50.583 --> 17:52.000
TOTAL STUDENTS: 29,
ARRIVED: 28, ABSENT: 1

17:58.416 --> 18:00.250
Yes! I got in!

18:00.333 --> 18:01.833
Same with me.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.708
It's so idiotic!

18:28.958 --> 18:31.375
Hey, you put it on wrongly.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.125
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.583
<i>Those were the happiest times.</i>

18:38.375 --> 18:39.500
<i>I was so happy</i>

18:40.250 --> 18:41.833
<i>that I almost forgot</i>

18:43.708 --> 18:45.583
<i>the thing that I didn't want to think of.</i>

18:45.666 --> 18:47.916
-It's so hot.
-Super hot.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.666
Why are you drinking my drink?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.375
Who knows if you have enterovirus?

18:52.458 --> 18:54.416
-What?
-Yuan-yuan. Hi.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.125
Just a second.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.458
-Take this. Bye.
-Bye.

18:58.541 --> 19:00.458
-Bye, Che-kai.
-Bye.

19:00.541 --> 19:02.250
You are still saying "bye"?

19:02.333 --> 19:03.958
RENHUA UNIVERSITY

19:06.791 --> 19:08.791
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

19:10.333 --> 19:11.458
Hey, K.

19:11.958 --> 19:13.041
What?

19:13.125 --> 19:14.791
Why are you alone today?

19:14.875 --> 19:16.000
Is Cream not with you?

19:16.083 --> 19:18.125
Of course, I'm the one taking the course.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.708
You usually hang out together.

19:20.791 --> 19:22.916
The teaching assistant thought
she was a double major.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.291
She had spare time last time.

19:24.375 --> 19:25.708
She was here to kill some time.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.208
Hey.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.583
Have you ever thought

19:28.666 --> 19:30.000
of dating Cream?

19:32.666 --> 19:33.625
Do you know?

19:33.708 --> 19:35.000
Just in our department,

19:35.083 --> 19:37.000
three guys have already tried
asking Cream out.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.583
She didn't say yes to any of them.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.458
I think she's waiting for you
to tell her how you feel.

19:42.708 --> 19:45.083
Cream and I are a family. Impossible.

19:45.916 --> 19:47.458
That's what you think.

19:47.541 --> 19:49.208
Maybe she's really waiting for you.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.125
No way. Thank you.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.083
Are you afraid of being rejected?

19:58.041 --> 19:59.583
I'm not afraid of rejection.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.833
I just can't afford to be rejected.

20:03.583 --> 20:04.541
What are you talking about?

20:05.291 --> 20:06.958
If I really tell her how I feel

20:07.041 --> 20:08.583
and she really accepted,

20:09.291 --> 20:11.083
if we break up one day,

20:11.166 --> 20:12.833
I'll have to leave her.

20:12.916 --> 20:14.250
Then what do I do?

20:15.375 --> 20:17.416
Then don't leave her.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.791
Who would think about the breakup

20:18.875 --> 20:20.583
before they even start dating?

20:20.666 --> 20:21.791
-Some people do.
-Who?

20:21.875 --> 20:22.833
I do.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.666
You are sick.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.166
Yes, I am.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.500
I'm leaving.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.000
What do you think? Was that good?

21:18.291 --> 21:19.791
What's wrong?

21:25.541 --> 21:27.333
I read this article before.

21:27.416 --> 21:28.625
It says

21:28.708 --> 21:31.041
the sea separates us from the afterlife.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.041
So if one day,

21:34.125 --> 21:35.750
when we're gone,

21:36.250 --> 21:38.708
a ferryman would carry us
to the end of the sea.

21:38.791 --> 21:40.375
That's the other side.

21:43.666 --> 21:45.333
After reading it,

21:45.416 --> 21:47.416
I really wanted to go to the beach.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.791
I feel like when I get there,

21:50.625 --> 21:52.083
I'll find them

21:52.166 --> 21:53.208
and see my family.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.291
If you want to go,

21:55.375 --> 21:56.666
we'll go.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.875
I'll go with you.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.333
Let me ask you something.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.708
Hypothetically.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.125
Ask away.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.458
If one day,

22:14.958 --> 22:16.833
there's someone I like,

22:18.125 --> 22:19.416
will you be jealous?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.166
Who do you like? Do I know him?

22:25.083 --> 22:26.916
It's just a hypothetical question.

22:27.791 --> 22:29.125
If it's hypothetical,

22:29.208 --> 22:30.416
why should I answer you?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.666
So, you will be jealous?

22:33.166 --> 22:34.583
I won't.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.500
What if it's true?

22:40.833 --> 22:41.791
Who do you like then?

22:46.541 --> 22:48.750
Why should I tell you?
You won't even answer me.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.000
Hey, why should I tell you?

22:50.083 --> 22:52.708
-Don't waste food.
-So what?

22:52.791 --> 22:54.125
It's none of your business.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.333
-Why are you throwing it at me? You…
-You…

22:56.416 --> 22:57.541
I'll throw it in your guitar.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.291
<i>I was slightly hoping</i>

22:59.375 --> 23:00.416
That hurts.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.916
<i>that Cream's hypothetical question</i>

23:02.958 --> 23:04.166
<i>was to test the waters.</i>

23:08.041 --> 23:09.333
<i>Just in our department,</i>

23:09.416 --> 23:11.125
<i>three guys have already tried
asking Cream out.</i>

23:11.208 --> 23:12.750
She didn't say yes to any of them.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.916
I think she's waiting for you
to tell her how you feel.

23:16.416 --> 23:17.666
<i>If one day,</i>

23:17.750 --> 23:19.833
there's someone I like,

23:20.333 --> 23:21.375
will you be jealous?

23:22.125 --> 23:23.625
<i>We're afraid of rejection,</i>

23:24.291 --> 23:25.458
<i>so we tested it.</i>

23:26.333 --> 23:28.208
<i>We wanted to know the answer,</i>

23:28.833 --> 23:30.333
<i>so we tested it.</i>

23:31.083 --> 23:32.583
<i>We really liked each other,</i>

23:33.166 --> 23:34.833
<i>-so we tested it.</i>
-Hey.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.791
Hey.

23:37.875 --> 23:38.958
What do you want?

23:39.833 --> 23:40.791
What are you doing?

23:42.458 --> 23:43.583
I…

23:44.083 --> 23:45.250
I was just zoning out.

23:45.333 --> 23:46.208
Why?

23:46.291 --> 23:48.583
Whatever. I won't be home for dinner.

23:49.875 --> 23:51.541
Who are you going to eat with?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.000
People from my department.

23:53.916 --> 23:54.833
I see.

23:54.916 --> 23:56.458
I'll bring you dinner.

23:58.583 --> 23:59.791
Bye.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.833
<i>But no matter what I say,</i>

24:07.708 --> 24:09.625
<i>these are just my assumptions.</i>

24:10.916 --> 24:12.291
<i>If I don't do anything,</i>

24:13.250 --> 24:15.666
<i>I will never know what Cream is thinking.</i>

24:24.666 --> 24:28.416
SEASIDE, ROMANTIC, CONFESSION

24:28.500 --> 24:30.750
MUST-TAKE PHOTOS
OF THE ROMANTIC MIRROR OF THE SKY

24:30.833 --> 24:32.458
TAIWAN IS ALSO ON THE LIST!

24:32.541 --> 24:34.666
<i>Although I'm full of uncertainties</i>

24:35.250 --> 24:36.791
<i>about the future,</i>

24:39.958 --> 24:41.708
<i>I still want to give it a try.</i>

24:42.208 --> 24:44.333
<i>You have arrived at Yanhailiao Station.</i>

24:44.416 --> 24:46.875
<i>Please get ready to disembark.</i>

24:49.458 --> 24:51.625
My neck hurts so much.

24:51.708 --> 24:53.583
How can you sleep
when the train ride was bumpy?

24:53.666 --> 24:54.875
You're really something.

24:56.083 --> 24:58.416
So where are you taking me?

24:59.916 --> 25:01.208
You'll see later.

25:02.416 --> 25:03.958
Are you trying to sell me?

25:04.041 --> 25:05.333
I won't get paid much for it.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.541
How can it be?

25:06.625 --> 25:08.625
I'm worth a lot because I'm so cute.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.875
Come on. We'll rent a motorcycle first.

25:13.375 --> 25:14.500
What should we eat?

25:24.083 --> 25:25.416
What are you doing?

25:26.708 --> 25:27.833
Nothing.

25:31.833 --> 25:35.291
You look especially happy today.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.583
Really?

25:38.166 --> 25:40.250
Maybe because I haven't gone out
in so long.

25:41.541 --> 25:42.833
Where are you taking me?

25:43.916 --> 25:45.958
A beautiful place.

25:46.041 --> 25:47.250
The beach?

25:50.083 --> 25:51.458
Am I right?

25:54.083 --> 25:56.083
There are beaches in Taipei too.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.916
This is a very special beach.

25:59.083 --> 26:00.166
A special beach?

26:04.041 --> 26:05.375
Eat up.

26:05.458 --> 26:06.875
This is so delicious.

26:06.958 --> 26:08.041
I like it.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.166
The soup is very good.

26:17.958 --> 26:20.083
Chang Che-kai!

26:20.166 --> 26:23.000
We're in Kenting!

26:23.083 --> 26:25.458
Yes!

26:39.125 --> 26:41.291
Chang Che-kai, you're going too slow.

26:42.375 --> 26:43.875
Is it because of my weight?

26:43.958 --> 26:46.083
No, I can't go too fast downhill.

26:46.583 --> 26:47.791
Then why did the scooter shake

26:47.875 --> 26:49.041
when I was getting on it?

27:08.625 --> 27:09.958
<i>How I wished</i>

27:11.125 --> 27:13.625
<i>that we could stay in this moment forever.</i>

27:15.458 --> 27:17.500
<i>Because once the moment has passed,</i>

27:18.458 --> 27:20.333
<i>the next thing that greets me</i>

27:23.833 --> 27:25.833
<i>is a sad dream</i>

27:30.083 --> 27:31.625
<i>that I can't wake up from.</i>

27:35.458 --> 27:37.041
Hang in there, let me apply the medicine.

27:39.750 --> 27:40.583
EMERGENCY TREATMENT AREA

27:40.666 --> 27:42.875
Mr. Chang Che-kai.
Your health insurance card.

27:44.625 --> 27:47.083
-Thank you.
-Regarding the blood test abnormalities,

27:47.166 --> 27:48.541
the doctor advised you

27:48.625 --> 27:50.916
to check with a hospital
when you go back to Taipei.

27:51.625 --> 27:53.250
-Okay. Thank you.
-No problem.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.250
What do you need to check?

28:06.375 --> 28:07.541
What happened?

28:14.041 --> 28:15.416
Why are you crying?

28:17.333 --> 28:19.166
You were in there for so long.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.541
I didn't know what was wrong with you.

28:21.625 --> 28:23.833
I was afraid you would be like my parents,

28:23.916 --> 28:25.583
and you would leave me.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.125
Stupid.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.541
You're overthinking things.

28:34.583 --> 28:35.625
I was just…

28:35.708 --> 28:37.416
I was just chatting with the doctor.

28:43.708 --> 28:46.916
Then why did you suddenly collapse?

28:48.208 --> 28:49.833
What did they ask you to check?

28:51.750 --> 28:52.833
It's nothing.

28:53.541 --> 28:54.666
It's…

28:54.750 --> 28:56.250
It's just a tiny fever.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.208
I was just too tired recently.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.166
Let's go home for now.

29:10.708 --> 29:11.833
Come on.

29:14.416 --> 29:16.500
<i>When I saw Cream crying sorrowfully,</i>

29:18.958 --> 29:21.083
<i>I knew I was being selfish.</i>

29:23.875 --> 29:25.500
<i>What she needs isn't me,</i>

29:27.791 --> 29:29.625
<i>but someone who can protect her</i>

29:31.625 --> 29:33.333
<i>and won't make her cry.</i>

29:36.208 --> 29:37.416
Hello, Pang.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.916
<i>Why? Do you want a drink?</i>

29:39.000 --> 29:40.458
No. I just wanted to ask you.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.166
Is Cream married?

29:42.250 --> 29:44.333
<i>Yes. I was at the wedding.</i>

29:44.416 --> 29:45.333
<i>Why?</i>

29:45.958 --> 29:48.666
Do you know who the groom is then?

29:49.666 --> 29:50.791
<i>The groom…</i>

29:51.750 --> 29:54.125
<i>I think his name was Yang Yu-hsien.</i>

29:54.208 --> 29:55.458
<i>He's a dentist.</i>

29:55.958 --> 29:57.333
<i>Do you have his number?</i>

29:57.833 --> 29:59.958
<i>I know his clinic. I'll send it to you.</i>

30:01.125 --> 30:03.375
<i>Also, Yang Yu-hsien's ex-girlfriend</i>

30:03.875 --> 30:05.500
<i>was the photographer, Yu Chen-hsi.</i>

30:21.250 --> 30:23.833
Good. Be more relaxed.

30:23.916 --> 30:26.333
-Relax your shoulders.
-Director.

30:26.416 --> 30:27.708
Okay. Thank you.

30:28.416 --> 30:30.666
Yu-hsien, don't be so stiff. Smile.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.083
You're looking good.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.250
He's such a talented doctor.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.500
We're counting on you.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.291
Director, you're too kind.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.166
He's young and capable.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.625
Director, let me take some photos
of Dr. Yang alone.

30:41.708 --> 30:42.791
You can take a break.

30:43.291 --> 30:44.291
We'll be done soon.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.291
Okay.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.250
This way, please.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.208
You're more relaxed now, right?

31:00.666 --> 31:01.875
Take this.

31:01.958 --> 31:03.458
-You'll feel more comfortable.
-Okay.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.666
Did you get dumped?

31:10.750 --> 31:11.875
No.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.208
Then why can't you smile?

31:14.291 --> 31:16.208
I'm just not used to being
in front of the cameras.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.791
You look great when you smile.

31:23.875 --> 31:24.750
Look.

31:25.958 --> 31:27.250
Isn't this great?

31:29.708 --> 31:31.333
Is everyone here?

31:31.416 --> 31:32.750
Let's take a group photo.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.458
Yu-hsien, why are you over there?

31:36.541 --> 31:38.041
-Come on.
-It's okay. Really.

31:38.125 --> 31:39.708
-I can just stand here.
-Come here.

31:39.791 --> 31:41.208
-Come here.
-No, really.

31:41.291 --> 31:43.333
-You're the rising star at our clinic.
-Yes.

31:43.416 --> 31:45.500
You should be in the middle. Here.

31:45.583 --> 31:47.458
All right. Look over here.

31:48.791 --> 31:49.958
Good. One more.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.666
Three, two, one.

32:04.375 --> 32:06.750
Do you know she's suing me
for interfering with your marriage?

32:07.416 --> 32:08.875
I'm working on that.

32:09.375 --> 32:11.083
Give me one more month.

32:11.583 --> 32:14.791
How many more months
do I have to give you?

32:14.875 --> 32:17.291
-Listen to me, okay?
-Don't touch me!

32:17.833 --> 32:19.583
What I want is simple.

32:20.625 --> 32:23.416
-Don't make promises you can't keep.
-I can do it.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.791
No, you can't.

32:26.541 --> 32:27.875
Don't call me again. Go.

32:29.416 --> 32:30.500
Get lost.

32:46.416 --> 32:47.541
Hey.

32:58.750 --> 33:00.083
Thank you.

33:08.958 --> 33:10.166
Are you okay?

33:10.250 --> 33:11.250
It's nothing.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.333
That was…

33:14.625 --> 33:15.791
Was that Jen Kuang?

33:17.416 --> 33:19.333
I saw his exhibition. He's very talented.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.458
He is my boss.

33:22.666 --> 33:24.375
I think he's talented too.

33:27.291 --> 33:30.291
Even if he's married,
I still want to be with him.

33:31.916 --> 33:33.041
I'm a bitch.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.083
No.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.375
I just feel bad. That's all.

33:36.875 --> 33:39.041
You're a great girl.

33:39.791 --> 33:41.208
Don't beat yourself up.

33:47.541 --> 33:48.708
My patient is here.

33:49.208 --> 33:50.125
I'm going in.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.916
DR. YANG YU-HSIEN

34:50.500 --> 34:52.291
I think I've heard this tune before.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.708
Did Cream play it for you?

34:57.333 --> 34:59.000
At Chang Che-kai's funeral,

35:00.833 --> 35:03.166
I thought I heard Yuan-yuan sing.

35:38.333 --> 35:39.583
<i>All I remember</i>

35:41.625 --> 35:42.875
<i>is that she was very upset.</i>

35:45.833 --> 35:48.041
Then one day,
she went out and never came back.

35:57.625 --> 36:00.000
So I don't know
about the copyright to this song.

36:01.375 --> 36:02.583
I'm sorry,

36:03.250 --> 36:04.750
but there's nothing I can do.

36:11.916 --> 36:12.875
It looks like

36:13.791 --> 36:15.375
this song was written by K and Cream

36:15.458 --> 36:17.541
when they were together before they died.

36:19.958 --> 36:21.958
I think I know how Cream felt.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.750
After K died,

36:24.833 --> 36:26.458
she chose to commit suicide.

36:27.666 --> 36:29.375
Losing the person you love the most

36:30.500 --> 36:32.125
is the same

36:32.208 --> 36:34.291
as losing the reason to live.

36:38.375 --> 36:41.000
K probably gave the copyright to Cream.

36:41.583 --> 36:43.166
But then Cream died.

36:46.583 --> 36:47.500
So…

36:47.583 --> 36:49.291
So who has the copyright?

36:50.750 --> 36:53.083
Maybe we were wrong from the beginning.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.375
We shouldn't go after the copyright.

36:55.875 --> 36:58.541
We need to find the person
who sent the song.

36:59.958 --> 37:02.291
But there's no postmark on that envelope.

37:02.375 --> 37:03.708
Where do we start?

37:12.791 --> 37:13.625
Hello?

37:13.708 --> 37:14.791
<i>Hello, An-an.</i>

37:14.875 --> 37:15.875
<i>I'm Alex.</i>

37:16.458 --> 37:18.000
<i>Are you free tonight?</i>

37:18.083 --> 37:19.291
What?

37:19.375 --> 37:20.833
You got the wrong number.

37:20.916 --> 37:22.375
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

37:22.458 --> 37:24.166
<i>We can have dinner first.</i>

37:24.250 --> 37:26.875
<i>Then come to my place,
and we can explore each other's bodies.</i>

37:26.958 --> 37:27.958
Pervert!

37:28.041 --> 37:29.791
I'll call the police if you call me again.

37:29.875 --> 37:32.000
Crazy and disgusting.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.083
Who is it?

37:35.666 --> 37:37.250
No idea.
I keep getting harassed with calls.

37:37.333 --> 37:38.750
I don't know how they got my number.

37:39.708 --> 37:41.041
How do I block him?

37:42.833 --> 37:44.250
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

37:44.333 --> 37:45.833
You're not married yet, right?

37:45.916 --> 37:47.291
Do you have a girlfriend?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.458
Does your son know
how to use the Internet?

37:51.583 --> 37:52.708
Yes. Why?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
An Ke-le.

38:05.833 --> 38:08.125
Why did you sign me up for a dating site

38:08.208 --> 38:09.333
and write posts for me?

38:11.666 --> 38:13.708
You keep telling everyone
that I am your sister.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.416
You even asked if Mr. Wang was single.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.791
What are you trying to do?

38:22.458 --> 38:23.583
Fine.

38:23.666 --> 38:25.208
You won't tell me, right?

38:25.875 --> 38:28.833
Then, we won't talk anymore
until you tell me.

38:31.291 --> 38:33.583
I wanted to find you a boyfriend.

38:34.916 --> 38:36.125
What were you thinking?

38:36.208 --> 38:37.791
You're only ten.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.791
Why would you find me a boyfriend?

38:40.291 --> 38:41.791
And where did you find these websites?

38:41.875 --> 38:42.791
Have you gone bad?

38:43.458 --> 38:45.833
I'm helping you.

38:46.541 --> 38:47.500
Think about it.

38:47.583 --> 38:50.333
If people know you have
a ten-year-old son,

38:50.416 --> 38:52.416
do you think you'll be able
to find a boyfriend?

38:53.083 --> 38:54.416
I told you.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.208
I don't need a boyfriend

38:56.291 --> 38:57.416
and I don't want one either.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.833
What do you want me to do?

39:00.541 --> 39:01.375
Or…

39:01.458 --> 39:02.833
Do you think you need a dad

39:02.916 --> 39:03.791
to be happy?

39:04.458 --> 39:06.250
Fine. Choose a guy for me.

39:06.333 --> 39:07.166
I'll marry him now.

39:07.250 --> 39:08.208
Are you happy now?

39:09.666 --> 39:10.916
What do you want then?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Tell me.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.041
I'm afraid that when I'm not here anymore,

39:14.125 --> 39:16.416
you won't have a family.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.250
Didn't the doctor say

39:23.333 --> 39:25.250
I'm going to have another surgery?

39:28.833 --> 39:31.291
Mom, will I really get better?

39:33.166 --> 39:34.875
Am I going to die?

39:45.291 --> 39:46.666
No.

39:47.291 --> 39:48.541
No.

39:48.625 --> 39:49.916
No.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
No.

39:51.083 --> 39:54.916
I will figure something out.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.541
You will be with me for a long time.

39:57.625 --> 39:58.791
Ke-le.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.583
Don't think too much, okay?

40:01.875 --> 40:02.875
Good boy, Ke-le.

40:02.958 --> 40:04.208
Ke-le, don't cry.

40:04.291 --> 40:05.583
Don't cry.

40:05.666 --> 40:06.708
I'm here.

40:09.333 --> 40:10.333
Good boy, Ke-le.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.375
Good boy, Ke-le.
