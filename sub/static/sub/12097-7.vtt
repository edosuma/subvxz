he is, Mrs. Tate?

03:03.249 --> 03:06.251
Well,
it isn't really a surprise.

Maybe a little surprise.
It's not a great big surprise.

Carol...

Just tell me.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.282
Well,
my father just came into town,

03:37.283 --> 03:39.785
and I thought, you know,
that since he's here,

03:39.786 --> 03:41.286
we should, uh, tell him.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.287
We?

03:42.288 --> 03:46.291
Well, Daddy's
kind of overprotective.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.795
Um, he's always thought of me
as his princess,

03:49.796 --> 03:51.297
so I thought you could tell him.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.302

He already knows you're gay.

Oh...

04:08.815 --> 04:10.816
No, I told him that
when we moved in together

04:10.817 --> 04:12.317
so he wouldn't worry.

Well, thanks, Jodie.
I appreciate that.

it's a bit of surprise.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.927
In my day,
things were a little different.

is Carol's happiness,

06:05.932 --> 06:07.432
what she wants.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.935
If she's happy, I'm happy.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.446
All right, uh...

06:21.447 --> 06:22.948
All right.
Let me tell you something.

06:22.949 --> 06:26.952
If you ever bring
that faggot around,

06:26.953 --> 06:28.454
I'll knock his teeth
down his throat.

06:29.895 --> 06:31.456
Well, Daddy,
if that's the way you feel,

06:31.457 --> 06:32.958
then why did you say
the things you did?

06:32.959 --> 06:36.462
Well, a person has to be civil.

06:46.973 --> 06:47.973
Here.

06:47.974 --> 06:48.974
What's this for?

06:48.975 --> 06:50.475
To wear. They're
your clothes.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.977
You're giving them back to me?

06:51.978 --> 06:53.979
Yeah.
It's a trick.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.982
You want me to put 'em on
so you can rip them off again.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.485
I don't want to do that anymore.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.988

to kill me?

07:02.989 --> 07:05.992
I don't have any more plans,
Elaine.

07:08.494 --> 07:10.495
I'm giving up.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.496
What does that mean?

07:11.497 --> 07:15.000
It means
I don't know what to do.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.001
There's one thing I do know,

07:16.002 --> 07:18.503
and that's
I can't go on like this.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.006
Of course, I don't have
a lot of happy choices.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.007
Being with you has been murder

07:22.008 --> 07:24.009
and leaving you
would literally be murder,

07:24.010 --> 07:25.011
so I don't know.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.012
It's that awful, huh?

07:27.013 --> 07:30.515
It's that awful being with me.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.517
It sure has been.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.020
And the thing is
that there was a time

07:35.021 --> 07:38.023
when I had the feeling
it didn't have to be.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.525
Once, I think you had a day

07:40.526 --> 07:43.528
when you were nice...

07:43.529 --> 07:46.531
just...
just a nice, normal lady,

07:46.532 --> 07:48.033
and I really enjoyed you.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.034
In fact, I thought we had

07:49.035 --> 07:51.036
great possibilities.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.537
But then, the next day,

07:52.538 --> 07:56.041
you were spitting food at me
and calling me "yutz."

07:58.044 --> 07:59.044
I don't hate you, Danny.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.046
Well, you sure give
the best damn impression of it

08:01.047 --> 08:02.547
I've ever seen.

08:02.548 --> 08:03.548
I know.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.550
Well, why do you
do that, Elaine?

08:05.551 --> 08:07.552
Why do you treat people
that way?

08:07.553 --> 08:10.556
It's a long story.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.560
I got time.

08:17.563 --> 08:20.065
I had a sister once...

08:20.066 --> 08:22.567
who was a couple of years older
than me.

08:22.568 --> 08:26.071
Her name was Diana.

08:26.072 --> 08:29.074
[SIGHS]
She was bright and beautiful,

08:29.075 --> 08:32.077
and good and kind.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.078
She was one of those people

08:33.078 --> 08:37.082
who made everybody around her
feel good.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.082
When she was 16,

08:38.083 --> 08:42.587
she was killed
in a car accident.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.589
The night she died,
my father, in his grief,

08:44.590 --> 08:49.595
said to me,
"Why wasn't it you?"

08:52.098 --> 08:56.601
So, uh, my mother was dead
and my sister was dead...

08:56.602 --> 08:58.103
and my father,

08:58.104 --> 09:00.605
who I loved more
than anyone else in this world,

09:00.606 --> 09:02.608
wished I was dead.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.613
And I got angry.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.118
I got angry, cold, mean...

09:14.620 --> 09:15.620
And I decided then

09:15.621 --> 09:18.624
never to love anybody
ever again.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.632
Oh, Elaine, I didn't know.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.637
I love you, Danny.

09:33.639 --> 09:38.143
And maybe, someday,
if it's not already too late,

09:38.144 --> 09:40.146
you'll love me.

Hey, what are
you doing down here?

10:02.168 --> 10:05.170
I was waiting up for you.
I guess I didn't make it.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.171
Is something wrong?

10:06.172 --> 10:08.673
No, no.

10:08.674 --> 10:09.674
I just wanted to see you.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.177
I haven't seen you
for three days.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.678
Three days! Mary, come on.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.680
You saw me this morning.

10:15.681 --> 10:16.681
This morning I saw you

10:16.682 --> 10:18.183
as you were leaving the bathroom

10:18.184 --> 10:19.184
and I was entering.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.685
You said, "Good morning.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.187
We're out
of toilet paper."

10:23.689 --> 10:26.191
You're never here.
You're always working.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.692
Come on.
Hey, I'm building a future.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.694
This is for us, kiddo. For you.

you ever dreamed of,

Don't you want a bigger house?

10:34.700 --> 10:37.202
No, I don't want a bigger house.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.704
Mary, go back to sleep.
I'll talk to you in the morning.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.706
I never met anybody who doesn't
want a bigger house.

10:41.707 --> 10:42.707
I don't!

10:42.708 --> 10:45.210
I couldn't care less
about those things.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.711
When did you ever hear me say

10:46.712 --> 10:49.214
I wanted a bigger house?

10:49.215 --> 10:50.715
All I want is you.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.717
You got me.
You got me.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.220
I just want you
to have everything.

has everything.
