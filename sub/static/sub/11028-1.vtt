yeah, that's really good.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.830
And you, you like
being a hockey coach?

01:35.960 --> 01:36.995
- Yes.

01:37.120 --> 01:37.837
[chuckling]

01:37.960 --> 01:39.234
The girls love to play,

01:39.360 --> 01:40.953
and if they're happy,
I'm happy.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.838
- Mm.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.598
- Can be tricky, though.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.552
- I pity the boys
trying to date them.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.194
But on the pitch
they're actually great.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.880
- Getting out all their
frustrations...

01:52.000 --> 01:54.355
I suppose.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.074
- Something like that.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.199
I, I can't.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.038
I'm sorry.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.834
It's so good to see you.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.758
I embrace the dark.
I embrace the night.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.315
Beneath this magic tree
given to the first witches

03:41.440 --> 03:43.716
by the Prince of
the Underworld...

03:43.840 --> 03:45.592
we will bleed this
body of its life.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.189

03:53.040 --> 03:56.271
We reach out to his realm
with this special gift.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.439
Enchant this fruit and
grant us your familiars.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.120
They will be our bond
with the world beneath.

JU"

04:49.440 --> 04:52.239
[school bell rings]

04:56.280 --> 04:57.714
- Orchard got its name
because it's located

04:57.840 --> 04:59.672
in a fruit farming area.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.314
The town is also founded
by a Utopian cult

05:02.440 --> 05:04.829
which was later linked
to witchcraft.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.839
The most famous witch
was Eleanor Young.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.156
She was said to have been given
an enchanted Cherry Tree

05:10.280 --> 05:11.759
as a gift from the underworld.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.871
The roots of the tree
were nourished by

05:14.040 --> 05:15.269
the blood of human sacrifice

05:15.400 --> 05:18.597
which, in turn gave her
the power to use its magic.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.358
She also used its
wood and fruit

05:20.480 --> 05:22.437
to perform her spells
and glamours.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.392
The story goes that
she was arrested

05:24.520 --> 05:26.511
and convicted of
witchcraft but...

05:26.680 --> 05:28.034
when they tried to
burn her at the stake

05:28.160 --> 05:28.877
the fire wouldn't light.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.355
- Ooh, nice block.
- All in a day's work.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.073
- Eventually she was
banished from the town.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.554
- Hold it, Brian.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.035
Is there something going on?

05:37.160 --> 05:38.559
I asked a question.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.671
[scoffs]

05:41.440 --> 05:42.760
Okay, carry on, Brian.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.473
- He's not bad, is he?
- Thank you, Miss.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.874
- Shame about the hair,
though.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.274
Eleanor Young's legend
features

05:47.400 --> 05:49.073
strongly in local folklore but

05:49.240 --> 05:51.151
there are, in fact,
no records that exist

05:51.280 --> 05:53.556
to prove she ever lived
and, well,

05:53.680 --> 05:55.910
no one's ever found
the magic tree.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.071
But many people in
the 16th century

05:58.200 --> 05:59.395
were accused of witchcraft

05:59.520 --> 06:01.397
and communing
with evil spirits.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.874
They were often
burned at the stake

06:03.000 --> 06:03.910
with little proof of guilt.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.509
- Communing?
Isn't that like an orgy?

06:06.640 --> 06:08.551
- You know, I think that
does mean 'orgy', yeah.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.835
- People, please.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.839
Can we just concentrate
on folklore.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.030
- Fuck-lore.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.151
- Faith. Amy.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.079
I'll see you both after class.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.238
[chatter]

06:34.880 --> 06:36.518
[whistle blows]

06:36.640 --> 06:39.519
- Okay, girls, line up!

06:42.120 --> 06:43.838
My name is Sissy Young

06:43.960 --> 06:46.998
and I'm your new coach.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.158
Now I know the loss
of Miss Hunt last year

06:50.280 --> 06:52.351
must have been very
difficult for all of you

06:52.480 --> 06:55.120
and things will
never be the same.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.471
But I know that she wouldn't
want you to live in past.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.672
She would want you
to train hard

07:01.800 --> 07:03.950
and play to the best
of your abilities.

07:04.080 --> 07:07.118
So, let's honor her memory

07:07.280 --> 07:09.590
and play every game
this year to win.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.757
I have two places
available on the senior team

07:11.880 --> 07:13.314
for the match on Friday.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.795
Let's see you play.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.717
- Ah.
- Sorry.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.558
Hey, comedians,
cut it out.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.796
[giggling]

07:22.960 --> 07:25.156
- What's your name?
- Faith Maguire.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.475
- Okay-

07:26.600 --> 07:28.159
<i>Let's gm!</i>

07:28.280 --> 07:30.317

sani-pad goes, Faith.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.916

07:54.040 --> 07:56.031
- Can I have your attention,
please?

07:56.200 --> 07:58.077
I've made my decision for
the senior team line-up

07:58.200 --> 08:00.191
for the game on Friday.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.197
Caroline St John
and Jennifer Engels,

08:02.320 --> 08:05.039
you will captain the team
as usual.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.037
- What a shame,

08:06.160 --> 08:07.673
the fifteen year old
virgin didn't make it.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.069
- Shut up, Caroline.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.873
- I'm not finished, ladies.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.879
I like to reward talent,
so I'm pleased to announce

08:14.000 --> 08:18.312
the first place on the subs
bench will go to Faith Maguire.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.632
[school bell rings]

08:27.760 --> 08:29.910
- You know Brian has
a huge crush on you.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.475
- Brian Kelly?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.558
- He's cute.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.318
- Well, you go out
with him then.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.158
- That's my plan.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.793
- Are you gonna help me
or what?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.354
- Because I'm a mechanic now?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.835
- Oh, fucking whatever.
Just come and help me.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.071
Lift that up.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.273
- Well done, Faith.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.756
Best hockey player
to never get a match.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.914
- Oh, just piss off,
will you?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.759
- Congratulations
on not making the team.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.030
Virgins and retards
tend not to fit in.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.800
- Hey, no, no, no.
- Alright, girls, that's enough.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.275
- Save it for the hockey field.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.272
Shake hands.

09:12.840 --> 09:16.515
Jennifer, Caroline, I'm sure
you've got somewhere to be.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.951
- Come on, let's go.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.478
- We have another
senior match on Friday.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.079
Will you play?

09:25.200 --> 09:27.316
- Love to.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.238
Come on.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.077

and look after yourself,

10:50.560 --> 10:51.391
I'm worried about you.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.318
- Don't be,
don't think about it.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.078
Think about your birthday.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.760
Let's have a party.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.840
- Bye.

if you've got time
or whatever,

11:28.200 --> 11:30.510
d'you wanna go see a film
or get a pizza or something?

would be very happy with that.
