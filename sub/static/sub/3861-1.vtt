(Birdsong)

01:28.546 --> 01:30.631
(Faint sobbing)

02:51.171 --> 02:53.839
(Thinks) All I want to do is save the children,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.091
not destroy them.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.684
More than anything, I love children.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.396
More than anything.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.065
(Sobs)

03:14.527 --> 03:16.195
They need affection,

03:16.362 --> 03:18.238
love,

03:18.406 --> 03:21.283
someone who will belong to them,

03:21.451 --> 03:23.952
and to whom they will belong.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.332
(Man's voice echoes) May I ask you
a somewhat personal question?

03:28.499 --> 03:30.667
Do you have an imagination?

03:30.835 --> 03:31.877
Oh!

03:32.921 --> 03:34.838
Oh, yes, I can answer that.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.256
Yes.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.633
Good.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.428
Truth is very seldom understood
by any but imaginative persons

03:41.596 --> 03:43.180
and I want to be quite truthful.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.390
I’m a bachelor.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.101
But not, I might add, a lonely one.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.312
I spend a great deal of time abroad.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.399
As for my London life, well, it amuses me,

03:54.567 --> 03:59.029
but it's not the sort of amusement
that one could suitably share with children.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.284
In brief, Miss Giddens, I am a very selfish fellow

04:04.452 --> 04:08.789
and the last man alive to be saddled
so suddenly and so awkwardly

04:08.957 --> 04:11.083
with two orphaned infants.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.919
(Sighs) It’s most unfortunate.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.547
For I have no room for them,
neither mentally nor emotionally.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.383
Does that seem quite heartless?

04:19.550 --> 04:22.678
Honest, but not heartless.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.140
Then the children do not live with you?

04:27.308 --> 04:29.601
No, they are at my country estate in Bly,

04:29.769 --> 04:32.354
a rather large, rather lonely place.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.941
I’m sure you'll agree
the country seems the proper thing for children.

04:36.109 --> 04:40.445
I see from your letter that you are yourself
the daughter of a country parson.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.322
Oh, yes, here it is.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.449
"More than anything, I love children."

04:45.952 --> 04:47.202
Yes.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.079
How remarkable.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.249
For several years now, little Miles and Flora...

04:52.417 --> 04:54.626
Charming names, don't you think?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.628
..have had only me.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.630
well, poor brats.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.590
They need more than a distant uncle.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.885
They need more than a governess.
They need affection and love,

05:04.053 --> 05:07.556
and someone to whom they can belong
and who will belong to them.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.518
You, Miss Giddens.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.229
I feel that you are that person.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.815
Sir, you...

05:17.650 --> 05:21.153
..you do realise
that this would be my first position?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.613
what does that signify? If I trust you,

05:23.781 --> 05:26.033
if you trust me...

05:26.951 --> 05:28.410
You see, Miss Giddens,

05:28.578 --> 05:31.538
the person whom I engage
must solemnly promise

05:31.706 --> 05:34.374
to accept full and complete responsibility.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.085
She must never trouble me.

05:37.253 --> 05:41.298
Never. Never.
Neither complain nor appeal nor write.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.092
Simply take the whole thing over and...

05:45.094 --> 05:47.179
..leave me alone.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.265
what do you say, Miss Giddens?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.479
The children, er...

05:56.981 --> 06:00.317
- Have they had a governess before?
- Unfortunately.

06:00.485 --> 06:05.489
There was nothing wrong with Miss Jessel,
an excellent governess and a respectable woman.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.325
The children quite liked her,
especially little Flora.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.410
Oh, which reminds me,

06:10.578 --> 06:13.455
be careful not to broach that subject to Flora.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.166
She was so fond of Miss Jessel and...

06:17.126 --> 06:19.211
..it did come as an appalling shock.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.172
I’m not certain that I understand you, sir.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.299
- She died.
- (Clock chimes outside)

06:24.467 --> 06:29.262
Just when I thought I’d got the whole situation
settled and everything running smoothly...

06:30.431 --> 06:32.724
..the confounded woman died.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.769
It was all very odd.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.982
I was in Calcutta when it happened and
I’ve only now been able to seek a replacement.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.985
Meantime,
my nephew had to be sent off to school

06:44.153 --> 06:48.949
and the little girl, Flora, is being chaperoned
by my housekeeper, Mrs Grose.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.995
Help me, Miss Giddens, for truly I am helpless.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.793
Give me your hand.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.295
Give me your promise.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.424
well, sir,

07:05.591 --> 07:07.717
if you are really sure?

07:07.885 --> 07:10.720
Quite sure and very grateful.

07:10.888 --> 07:14.391
Only, remember, you're in supreme authority.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.394
whatever happens, you must handle it alone.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.272
Yes, I’ll try.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.316
I promise you that.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.987
I’ll do everything I can
to keep the children happy.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.415
Oh, stop! Please stop!

08:20.583 --> 08:23.877
- Whoa there!
- If you don't mind, I’d like to walk from here.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.587
As you wish, miss. Whoa!

08:33.429 --> 08:35.055
Thank you.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.295
(Rattle of woodpecker)

09:24.939 --> 09:26.856
WOMAN'S VOICE: Flora!

09:30.486 --> 09:42.872
Flora!

09:51.549 --> 09:52.966
Didn't you hear?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.093
Someone is calling your name.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.721
No, I don't think so. I didn't hear anyone.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.973
Isn’t your name, Flora?

10:01.475 --> 10:05.186
- I’m Miss Giddens.
- Yes, I know. You're my new governess.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.564
I’ve been watching the road waiting for you.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.776
- Are you afraid of reptiles?
- Oh, that rather depends. Why?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.904
Because I’ve got one in my pocket
and he's very eager to meet you.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.781
Well, in that case, by all means.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.120
- His name is Rupert.
- Oh, a tortoise.

10:22.288 --> 10:26.041
- We love each other.
- Yes, I can see that you're very close.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.500
Very.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.461
There, now you've met Miss Giddens.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.129
But Rupert isn't the only one.

10:31.297 --> 10:36.259
I mean, ever since my uncle wrote,
we've all been waiting and waiting for you to come.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.927
Oh, we have been excited.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.472
So have I. I’ve been very excited indeed.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.850
Not as excited as we have.
And not as excited as Mrs Grose.

10:44.018 --> 10:48.855
She's cleaned and cleaned. All the windows
are washed. Just imagine - 134 windows.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.780
- Oh, we will have fun together, won't we?
- Yes, we will, dear.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.661
Mrs Grose, she's here, she's here!
And she isn't afraid of reptiles.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.622
Oh, and that's more than can be said of me,
isn't it?

11:07.208 --> 11:11.044
I walked from the gate. I...I wanted to see it all.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.755
I’m glad to see you, Miss Giddens.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.508
Really, I’m glad.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.178
- Oh, do please come in.
- Thank you. You're very kind.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.938
- Oh!
- Now, I expect you'd like a cup of tea?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.356
Thank you.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.568
But not you, Miss Flora! Now, you know
you're not allowed in the house with that toad

11:35.736 --> 11:37.821
or turtle or whatever it is.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.491
- Go on, run along, off you go.
- All right.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.618
I had no idea.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.579
I never imagined!

11:46.747 --> 11:48.456
Oh, I’m so sorry.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.418
That's all right, miss, it's always happening.

11:53.087 --> 11:56.881
I never imagined it would be so beautiful.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.217
Well, we do our best.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.302
Though half the rooms are empty now.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.012
Locked and empty.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.182
All the same, it's too big, a job to keep clean.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.186
But what I always say is,
it's a heaven for children.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.063
Oh, yes, a heaven.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.733
And what an enchanting child she is.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.609
There's not another like her.

12:16.777 --> 12:20.321
Though, mind you, she has her ways.
You have your work cut out.

12:20.489 --> 12:23.116
I don't doubt it. But she seems...

12:23.284 --> 12:25.285
Well, she certainly looks angelic.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.664
Well, she is, too, but she does like to wander,
to go off by herself.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.959
- We're always hunting her.
- Oh, yes, I heard you.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.629
Just now as I was coming through the garden,
I heard you call her name.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.757
Oh, not me, miss.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.759
Perhaps it was Anna or Cook.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.594
Well, someone.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.221
Sit down, miss, and have your tea.

12:46.348 --> 12:50.143
It’ll be dark in here soon.
I’ll get Anna to bring some lamps.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.774
Miss Giddens?

12:55.941 --> 12:57.442
(Whispers) Miss Giddens!

12:57.610 --> 12:59.194
Has she gone?

12:59.361 --> 13:01.446
Yes, for the moment.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.871
You don't mind Rupert sharing
a bit of your cake now, do you?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.999
You watch out -
he'll grow too fat to fit your pocket.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.251
I have a pony, too.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.337
- Ooh.
- He isn't really mine.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.255
He belongs to Miles.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.133
Miles is my brother, you know.
He's away at school.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.010
You must miss him very much.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.221
Well, he'll be coming home soon.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.140
- Not, I should think, until the holidays.
- (Footsteps)

13:30.684 --> 13:33.686
Time you went upstairs
and got ready for your bath, Miss Flora.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.564
Promise now, you won't go away?

13:36.732 --> 13:39.651
I expect to be here for a very long time.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.285
And to think what qualms I had.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.788
I was so afraid.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.750
- Afraid, miss?
- I couldn't make up my mind.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.294
Should I accept this post or shouldn't I?

13:58.462 --> 14:00.839
Well, miss, I’m sure I’m very glad you did.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.508
Well, after all, I didn't have much choice.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.886
- Their uncle is most persuasive.
- (Laughs ruefully)

14:07.054 --> 14:10.557
Oh, and don't I know it!
Many's the time he's worked his magic on me.

14:10.724 --> 14:13.101
Even as a boy,
he could twist you round his finger

14:13.269 --> 14:15.270
and the children are the same way.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.607
He doesn't come down here very often?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.734
Well, he likes the town life.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.487
He always was a very popular gentleman,

14:24.655 --> 14:29.492
and what's the good of being popular here with
only the children and the pigeons and me?

14:32.162 --> 14:34.122
- Mrs Grose?
- Yes, miss?

14:34.290 --> 14:36.499
- What was she like?
- Who, miss?

14:37.501 --> 14:39.419
The other governess, the one who died.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.753
Miss Jessel?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.881
She was a young woman.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.092
Some thought her pretty,
and, well, I suppose she was,

14:46.260 --> 14:49.637
but not as pretty as you, miss, not by half.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.601
He seems to prefer them young and pretty.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.728
He did. He had the Devil's own eye.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.106
I mean, that's his way, the master's.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.233
But of whom did you speak first?

15:02.401 --> 15:06.446
Why, the master, of course.
There's nobody else, miss, nobody at all.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.075
- (Giggles)
- (Mrs Grose laughs)

15:13.162 --> 15:15.580
You'll splash Miss Giddens!

15:16.665 --> 15:20.668
And is the other one just as remarkable?
I mean, is he, too, as enchanting?

15:20.836 --> 15:23.880
If you like this one,
you'll be quite carried away by Master Miles.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.716
- Miles is coming!
- I seem to be carried away quite easily.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.927
That's what happened to me in London.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.803
Miles is coming! Miles is coming!

15:30.971 --> 15:35.016
Stuff and nonsense, miss. You know very well
Miles is at school. Now, hold still.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.268
- (Mrs Grose laughs)
- (Giggles)

15:39.688 --> 15:42.231
I’ve got a little bed in your room. It’s got curtains.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.400
- How nice.
- Yes.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.861
Mrs Grose wanted to give you a big room.

15:47.029 --> 15:51.574
But I said, "She'll only be there when
she's asleep and big rooms get bigger at night."

15:51.742 --> 15:53.660
- Do you know that?
- Do they?

15:53.827 --> 15:55.411
Mrs Grose doesn't know.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.289
(Whispers) She shuts her eyes in the dark.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.125
(Laughs) I think that's silly.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.378
- I always look in the dark.
- Do you?

16:03.545 --> 16:05.213
And what do you see?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.256
There are a lot of empty rooms.

16:07.424 --> 16:11.803
I said to Mrs Grose, "I wish there was some way
of sleeping in several rooms at once."

16:11.971 --> 16:14.847
Mrs Grose was quite startled by the thought.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.391
I don't wonder.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.894
"Stuff and nonsense!" she said.
"Stuff and nonsense!"

16:20.062 --> 16:22.146
(They laugh)

16:29.613 --> 16:32.991
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.743
Why can't Rupert sleep with me?

16:35.911 --> 16:39.330
Because you might roll over and crush him.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.083
- Crush a tortoise?
- Now, finish your prayers, dear.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.127
If I should wake before I...

16:44.294 --> 16:48.256
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen.

16:49.216 --> 16:52.051
Miss Giddens,
where would the Lord take my soul to?

16:52.219 --> 16:54.470
- To heaven.
- Are you certain?

16:54.638 --> 16:57.390
Yes, of course,
because you are a very, very good girl.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.183
But I might not be.

16:59.351 --> 17:03.062
And if I weren't, wouldn't the Lord
just leave me here to walk around?

17:03.230 --> 17:05.440
Isn’t that what happens to some people?

17:07.317 --> 17:09.277
(Screeching)

17:09.445 --> 17:11.112
Whatever was that?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.785
I’m sure something's been hurt.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.371
An animal.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.249
We must pretend we didn't hear it.
Mrs Grose says that.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.877
Pretend?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.463
Then we won't imagine things.

17:30.090 --> 17:34.218
Sometimes one can't help imagining things.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.182
(Gusts of wind)

18:09.379 --> 18:11.839
(Miss Giddens sighs in her sleep)

18:17.596 --> 18:19.680
(Whimpers softly)

18:41.203 --> 18:43.287
(Hums tune of O Willow Waly)

18:49.837 --> 18:51.546
(Breaks off)

18:56.135 --> 18:58.219
(Resumes humming)

19:08.272 --> 19:12.441
FLORA: ♪ By the tree that weeps with me

19:12.609 --> 19:17.446
♪ Singing "O Willow Waly"

19:17.614 --> 19:19.949
MRS GROSE: You should be outdoors
on a day like this.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.285
FLORA: Well, I was just practising, Mrs Grose.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.078
Have you seen Miss Giddens, my lamb?

19:24.246 --> 19:26.205
I’m out here, Mrs Grose.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.170
- There's some letters for you, miss.
- Oh, thank you.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.964
- Oh, please can I help you read them?
- Yes, if you like.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.383
- Which first?
- Now, how can I tell?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.635
- Then I shall choose.
- All right.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.809
- Here.
- This one's from my sister.

19:51.273 --> 19:55.443
Oh, look, dear, here's a picture
of me and my family together.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.613
- Am I in it?
- How could you be? It’s of my family.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.864
Oh.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.657
Now this one.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.076
- It’s from London.
- Is it from my uncle?

20:04.244 --> 20:06.579
Yes, I think it is.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.748
You do look pleased.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.169
- Is he coming to see us?
- No, dear.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.880
He's sent me a letter from Miles' school.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.732
Flora.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.692
Yes, Miss Giddens, dear?

20:36.860 --> 20:39.737
Didn't you say last night
that Miles was coming home?

20:39.905 --> 20:43.908
Oh, look, it's a lovely spider
and it's eating a butterfly.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.670
Mrs Grose.

20:55.837 --> 20:59.215
Here's a letter their uncle has forwarded
without opening.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.967
It’s from Miles' school.

21:01.134 --> 21:04.553
He just wrote on the envelope,
"I’m off to ltaly for the summer.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.682
This is from Miles' headmaster.
Deal with it. Don't bother me."

21:07.849 --> 21:11.143
- That's just his way, miss.
- But how am I to deal with it?

21:11.311 --> 21:13.396
Miles has been dismissed from school.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.148
- Dismissed?
- Sent home.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.942
Expelled.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.654
What has he done?
What do the gentlemen say?

21:21.822 --> 21:24.490
Oh, they go into no detail. They simply say...

21:25.284 --> 21:26.826
Here, read it.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.078
Read it for yourself.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.624
It’s no good, miss. I never learned.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.419
Oh, I’m sorry, I didn't realise.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.757
They say that it is impossible to keep him.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.010
- Why?
- That he is...

21:45.053 --> 21:47.013
.."an injury to the others".

21:47.180 --> 21:49.807
Master Miles? Him an injury?

21:51.101 --> 21:54.895
Oh, stuff and nonsense! You might as well
think ill of Miss Flora, bless her.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.023
You've never known him to be bad?

21:57.190 --> 21:59.150
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.277
You mean you like a boy with spirit?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.946
Well, so do I, but not to the degree to...

22:04.114 --> 22:05.990
contaminate.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.283
What?

22:09.494 --> 22:11.245
To corrupt.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.830
Master Miles?

22:13.749 --> 22:16.459
Oh, miss, are you afraid he'll corrupt you?

22:16.626 --> 22:18.210
(Laughs)

22:25.260 --> 22:26.635
FLORA: Miles is coming!

22:26.803 --> 22:29.055
Miles is coming! Miles is coming!

22:29.222 --> 22:32.099
Bly! Bly station!

22:33.894 --> 22:35.436
Miles! Miles!

22:37.689 --> 22:38.981
(Miss Giddens laughs)

22:39.149 --> 22:40.358
Miles!

22:40.525 --> 22:43.361
- You're Miss Giddens, aren't you?
- Yes.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.237
How do you do?

22:46.948 --> 22:48.824
Oh, thank you, Miles.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.994
FLORA: She's our new governess, Miles,
and she's awfully nice.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.372
I hope Miles will agree.

22:55.707 --> 22:56.957
Come.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.210
(Train whistle)

23:04.841 --> 23:06.675
Nothing's changed.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.303
Oh, I’ve been longing for these holidays.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.597
Holidays?

23:11.765 --> 23:15.101
Longing to see Bly and Mrs Grose and Flora.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.852
And you.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.105
Flora wrote and told me you were coming.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.318
Did you have a good term at school?

23:24.486 --> 23:27.279
Look, Miles, there's the lake!

23:27.447 --> 23:29.323
MILES: Oh, it is nice to be back!

23:29.491 --> 23:31.700
MISS GIDDENS: I hope you won't be lonely.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.620
With just Flora and Mrs Grose and me.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.626
Were you happy at school?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.464
May I tell you something?

23:46.383 --> 23:48.342
Yes, Miles, of course.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.262
I think you're far too pretty to be a governess.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.809
And I think you're far too young
to be such a deceitful flatterer!

23:56.977 --> 23:59.061
(They both laugh)

24:10.198 --> 24:11.907
Dearest Mrs Grose!

24:12.075 --> 24:15.619
- It is nice to be home.
- Stop, stop! You'll have me out of breath.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.955
- Come along.
- It’s all just the same.

24:18.123 --> 24:22.710
Somehow, I don't know,
I was afraid it might be different.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.379
Oh, nothing ever changes here, Master Miles.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.424
You look a bit thin, though.
We'll have to fatten you up.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.384
Miles, you haven't seen the pony.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.511
- May we?
- Yes, of course.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.138
Come on!

24:37.267 --> 24:38.809
(Laughs)

24:39.686 --> 24:41.729
- Well, miss?
- Oh, it's just as you said.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.981
Charm seems to run in the family.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.692
And that cruel letter?

24:46.860 --> 24:49.570
It must be a misunderstanding, a mistake.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.946
Yes, a mistake.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.741
So, what will you say to Master Miles?

24:53.909 --> 24:57.495
I shall have it out with him later on.
That can't be avoided. But not now.

24:57.662 --> 25:01.415
I’m not going to spoil his homecoming
because of some silly old schoolteacher.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.791
Yes, miss.

25:02.959 --> 25:06.128
Oh, I’m so thankful we're not to have trouble.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.551
Dear Mrs Grose, what a comfort you are.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.738
MILES: Why don't you come in, Miss Giddens?

25:35.492 --> 25:37.618
How did you know I was there?

25:37.786 --> 25:40.871
This is a very old house. Things creak.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.375
And anyway, I saw the light from your candle
under the door.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.546
- You should be asleep.
- I’m much too excited.

25:48.713 --> 25:52.007
- Excited?
- By being home, by seeing Flora.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.427
By meeting you.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.639
Besides, I like to lie awake.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.100
That's a very bad habit, Miles.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.810
- Is it?
- Yes.

26:02.978 --> 26:06.564
What do you think about
while you're lying awake?

26:06.731 --> 26:08.732
Oh, a world of different things.

26:08.900 --> 26:13.696
And tonight,
were you perhaps thinking about school?

26:13.863 --> 26:16.323
Oh, no, all that seems very far away.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.785
Miles...

26:19.953 --> 26:23.330
you do know
that you will not be allowed to go back?

26:25.750 --> 26:30.379
You realise that it is a very serious matter
for a boy to be expelled from school?

26:33.258 --> 26:35.342
I can't think what your uncle will say.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.428
Can't you? I can.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.014
He'll say, "Don't bother me, I’m too busy."

26:41.224 --> 26:43.309
- Miles, that's not true!
- Isn’t it?

26:43.476 --> 26:46.228
You've met him, haven't you?
You know what he's like.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.230
He doesn't care about me or Flora.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.399
He doesn't care what happens to us.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.695
Miles, dear, you mustn't believe that.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.156
Your uncle has...

26:57.324 --> 26:58.907
Well, he has...

26:59.075 --> 27:02.202
a great many responsibilities
and not enough time...

27:02.370 --> 27:04.330
..to waste any on us.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.206
I understand.

27:07.083 --> 27:11.170
It’s a bit sad, though,
when people don't have time for you.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.048
Oh, I have, Miles.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.678
I have time.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.722
And I care.

27:22.223 --> 27:26.310
And, Miles,
if there's something wrong about school,

27:26.478 --> 27:28.562
if there's something you want to tell me...

27:30.398 --> 27:31.732
Miles.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.859
Dear Miles,

27:34.027 --> 27:36.695
can't you see that I want to help you?

27:41.534 --> 27:43.327
Trust me.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.082
(Gust of wind)

27:49.626 --> 27:51.210
The candle's gone out.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.879
Don't be frightened.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.006
It was only the wind, my dear.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.258
The wind blew it out.

27:59.636 --> 28:03.305

(Buzzing of flies)

30:41.339 --> 30:42.923
Miles...

30:44.008 --> 30:45.968
..how long have you been here?

30:46.135 --> 30:47.553
I don't know.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.304
20 minutes, half an hour.

30:49.472 --> 30:51.306
Oh, then you must have seen him.

30:51.474 --> 30:54.768
- Who?
- The man who was standing here on the tower.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.773
I’ve been quite alone,
except for my greedy friends.

30:59.941 --> 31:04.611
Well, that can't be true. Not two minutes ago,
I saw a man standing exactly here.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.363
Perhaps it was me.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.615
No, no, it was a man.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.827
He was looking at me.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.954
I expect you imagined it.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.539
Or else...

31:15.915 --> 31:18.667
Oh, dear,
I hope you won't have to wear spectacles.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.003
You're much too pretty for that.

31:21.170 --> 31:24.339
Oh, yes, I expect I’m tired.
I haven't been sleeping well.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.924
I know.

31:26.092 --> 31:31.221
Flora told me. She says you make
little groans and moans all night.

31:31.389 --> 31:34.182
Of course, one can never believe Flora.

31:34.350 --> 31:37.477
She invents things, she imagines them.

31:37.645 --> 31:41.148
You mean like poor, silly Miss Giddens?

31:41.316 --> 31:42.649
(Laughs)

31:56.915 --> 31:59.708
Miss, would these by any chance be yours?

31:59.876 --> 32:03.086
Scissors. The gardener brought them up.
He found them in the garden.

32:03.254 --> 32:07.507
Yes, I must have dropped them this morning
when I...whilst I was cutting the roses.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.426
And just left them there.

32:09.594 --> 32:14.431
I’m afraid today isn't altogether my day.
I seem to be at sixes and sevens.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.267
Well, miss, you've never been
away from home before.

32:17.435 --> 32:21.229
Strange place, new responsibilities.
It takes a bit of getting used to...

32:21.397 --> 32:25.484
Mrs Grose, is there anyone living here
that I don't know about?

32:25.652 --> 32:28.695
- Living here?
- In the house, I mean.

32:29.739 --> 32:33.533
I’ve met the two maids and the cook
and her husband, the gardener.

32:33.701 --> 32:36.870
And I was just wondering
if there was someone I hadn't met.

32:37.038 --> 32:40.415
Bless you, miss, I wish there were.
We could use another pair of hands.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.043
- (Running footsteps)
FLORA: Oh, hurry, do come!

32:43.211 --> 32:45.629
You must see. Miles is giving an expedition.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.298
Oh, come, you must see. He's awfully brave.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.110
Miles!

33:18.246 --> 33:19.788
- (Laughs)
- Miles!

33:20.748 --> 33:22.082
(Flutter of wings)

33:22.250 --> 33:24.209
(Reverberating echo)

33:30.341 --> 33:31.717
Miles!

33:33.094 --> 33:35.178
I didn't know you were watching.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.181
That was very clever, Miles.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.368
Do look, Miss Giddens. I can draw, too.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.579
Miles isn't the only one who can draw.

34:02.707 --> 34:07.252
Oh, yes, now I see. It’s lovely. A vase of flowers.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.963
Goodness, no! It’s a thunderstorm.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.840
See the clouds and the lightning?

34:12.008 --> 34:15.343
Oh, yes, dear.
Yes, well, I’m sure it's very original.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.847
- Perhaps you'll grow up to be a famous artist.
- Did you hear that, Miles?

34:19.015 --> 34:22.392
Yes, dear,
but Miss Giddens is merely being polite.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.980
Tell me, Miss Giddens,
what do you think I might grow up to be?

34:27.148 --> 34:28.857
Anything you want.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.984
There's nothing I want to be.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.696
Except what I am - a boy living at Bly.

34:34.864 --> 34:38.617
Oh, if only everything could go on
just as it is now.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.579
I love this house.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.331
Don't you, Miss Giddens?

34:44.499 --> 34:47.626
It’s very beautiful and so large.

34:48.419 --> 34:51.713
I expect it's the biggest house in England.

34:51.881 --> 34:53.715
The whole world, actually.

34:53.883 --> 34:56.093
Oh, hardly the whole world, Flora.

34:56.260 --> 35:00.972
Your house, where you used to live,
was that a big house, too?

35:01.140 --> 35:02.891
No, it was very small, I’m afraid.

35:03.059 --> 35:06.311
- How small?
- Very, very small.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.396
Too small for you to have secrets?

35:09.398 --> 35:11.566
Well, secrets were a bit difficult.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.444
FLORA: But possible?
- Not for long.

35:14.612 --> 35:18.365
Secrets require a privacy
that our little home did not provide.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.618
Did you play games in your house?

35:21.786 --> 35:25.747
No, we had to be quiet, usually because
my father was preparing his sermon.

35:25.915 --> 35:29.668
But if he went out,
we'd play hide-and-seek all over the house.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.379
- Oh, lovely!
- Let's do that!

35:32.547 --> 35:35.507
All right, you hide and I’ll seek.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.427
We can go all over the house, can't we?
Everywhere, I mean.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.721
Yes, I should think so.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.685
Oh, where are the children going?
It’s their bedtime.

35:46.853 --> 35:51.523
Yes, I know. But I thought just one little game
and then right to bed they'll go.

35:51.691 --> 35:54.359
Oh, they've won you over, miss, already,
I can see.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.027
They have indeed.

35:56.195 --> 35:57.863
FLORA: We're ready!

35:58.030 --> 35:59.990
I’m coming!

36:18.092 --> 36:19.467
Anna?

36:25.516 --> 36:27.642
MILES: Miss Giddens!

37:16.359 --> 37:17.817
(Box snaps open)

37:17.985 --> 37:20.070
(Music box plays O Willow Waly)

37:40.091 --> 37:42.259
(Creaking)

37:45.263 --> 37:47.931
You'd never have found me
if I hadn't pounced on you.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.725
- Did I frighten you?
- Yes, a bit.

37:50.893 --> 37:54.229
- Now you're my prisoner!
- Oh, Miles, let me go.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.231
- Why?
- You're hurting me.

37:56.399 --> 37:59.609
- Am I?
- Yes, Miles, please let me go.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.987
- Why?
- I told you, you're hurting me.

38:02.154 --> 38:04.364
- Now, Miles, I mean it!
- Do you?

38:04.532 --> 38:08.493
FLORA: Oh, you've found it. I’ve missed it so.
Mrs Grose must have hidden it here.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.371
Now it's your turn to hide.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.039
Hurry, run!

38:13.207 --> 38:14.332
All right.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.084
Now where?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.877
Oh, where shall I hide?

38:18.045 --> 38:20.588
Wherever you like. We'll count to 1 00.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.592
One, two, three...

38:24.760 --> 38:27.846
(Both) Four, five, six,

38:28.014 --> 38:29.806
seven, eight...

39:03.591 --> 39:05.675
(Children laugh)

39:08.429 --> 39:11.890
FLORA: Miss Giddens, where are you?

39:14.185 --> 39:15.435
Argh!

39:46.092 --> 39:48.176
(Screeching)

39:51.055 --> 39:53.723
MRS GROSE: Miss? Miss Giddens?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.977
Whatever are you doing there, miss?

39:58.145 --> 40:00.271
Heavens, child! You're white as milk.

40:00.439 --> 40:03.483
I saw him! Don't tell me I didn't because I did.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.193
- I saw him staring.
- Who, miss?

40:05.361 --> 40:07.070
- The same man on the tower.
- The tower?

40:07.238 --> 40:11.616
But now, just now, he was staring past me
into the house, as if he were hunting someone.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.119
- What's he like, miss?
- He had dark, curling hair

40:14.286 --> 40:16.121
and the hardest, the coldest, eyes.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.665
Is he... Would you say he was very handsome?

40:18.833 --> 40:22.419
Yes, yes, handsome, handsome and obscene.
But I’ve seen him before. Yes, he...

40:22.586 --> 40:26.673
I know where I’ve seen him.
A picture. There's a picture of him.

40:26.841 --> 40:30.468
A miniature in a cracked glass in the attic.
I’ll show you.

40:30.636 --> 40:33.304
- It can't be.
- It can't be? You know him!

40:33.472 --> 40:35.849
Quint. Peter Quint, the master's valet.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.393
- But you said...
- Yes, miss. You see, he's dead.

40:38.561 --> 40:39.936
Quint is dead.

40:40.104 --> 40:43.565
- Dead?
- (Children laugh)

40:43.732 --> 40:45.650
(Music box plays O Willow Waly)

40:46.527 --> 40:48.611
(Children laugh hysterically)

41:22.813 --> 41:24.898
(Rumble of thunder)

41:28.194 --> 41:30.278
(Groans softly)

41:34.366 --> 41:35.575
(Thunderclap)

42:01.727 --> 42:03.811
(Screech of pencil on slate)

42:15.282 --> 42:18.701
Your pencil does have
the most terrible squeak, Flora.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.663
It does, doesn't it? But I can't help it, you know.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.582
Can't you?
I thought you were doing it on purpose.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.418
She is.

42:29.129 --> 42:31.839
- Stop it! Stop begging!
- I’m not begging!

42:32.007 --> 42:34.425
Yes, you are! You're begging for attention.

42:34.593 --> 42:37.220
- (Squeals and cries)
- There you are, begging again.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.597
First for attention, now for affection.

42:39.765 --> 42:42.475
- Stop it, Flora!
- No, Miles. Hush, Miles.

42:42.643 --> 42:46.020
Oh, darling. Oh, poor darling Flora.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.648
There now, look, I’ve made you cry.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.526
Oh, what a hateful,
what a grumpy old governess you have.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.737
- You're not grumpy at all.
- Of course you're not.

42:54.905 --> 42:58.658
- But I wouldn't wonder if you were.
- Not would I, with everything so horrible.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.202
Horrible?

43:01.370 --> 43:04.831
Why, as you know, the rain.
Not being able to go out in the garden.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.750
My squeaky pencil and me,
I wasn't even trying to be good.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.253
Oh, but you are good.

43:10.629 --> 43:12.130
You both are.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.674
I know what.

43:15.384 --> 43:18.469
Let's put away our books
and let's pretend it's Flora's birthday.

43:18.637 --> 43:20.597
- Oh, yes!
- All right, it's your birthday.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.932
- Now, what would you like to do?
- Have a party.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.684
A costume party.

43:24.852 --> 43:28.313
That's a splendid idea!
Miles and I will go and get all dressed up.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.356
- May we?
- Yes, of course you may.

43:30.524 --> 43:32.692
- Come along then, Flora.
- Oh, good!

43:36.905 --> 43:38.990
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Where are you going?

43:39.158 --> 43:40.783
To dress up. You said we might.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.536
- I’ll come with you.
- No, then there'd be no surprise.

43:43.704 --> 43:47.081
- You wait downstairs. We won't be long.
- Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

43:54.798 --> 43:56.382
I’ve let them go.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.343
- Go where, miss?
- Oh!

43:58.510 --> 44:00.678
Oh, I’ve let the children go...

44:00.846 --> 44:02.221
upstairs.

44:02.389 --> 44:05.058
To the attic, perhaps. Alone.

44:05.225 --> 44:07.060
(Laughs) Is that all?

44:07.227 --> 44:09.979
- They'll come to no harm.
- I can't.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.440
I can't leave them alone,
not after the other night.

44:12.608 --> 44:15.276
As for the other night, miss,
put it out of your mind.

44:15.444 --> 44:18.112
Pretend it was part of a dream,
which perhaps it was.

44:18.280 --> 44:21.491
A dream?
Oh, don't you think I want to believe that?

44:21.659 --> 44:24.661
That it was just the darkness? A nightmare?

44:24.828 --> 44:28.915
But it's no longer dark, it's daylight.
And I know I saw him.

44:29.083 --> 44:32.251
A man, or something that once was a man,

44:32.419 --> 44:36.047
peering in through the window,
looking for someone.

44:36.215 --> 44:39.342
And if it isn't true, if I didn't see him,

44:39.510 --> 44:42.011
how could I have described him so accurately?

44:42.179 --> 44:44.722
Well, you had seen his picture.

44:45.599 --> 44:48.810
Really, miss,
you're upsetting yourself over nothing.

44:48.977 --> 44:51.270
You said he was the valet?

44:51.438 --> 44:54.774
Yes, but when the master left,
Quint was alone with us in charge.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.985
Tell me, how did he die?

44:58.654 --> 45:02.323
Quint? Out there, miss, on those very steps.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.076
It was winter.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.745
The coldest, blackest winter's night.

45:08.706 --> 45:13.167
The steps were icy, and Quint,
he came home late after we were all a-bed.

45:13.335 --> 45:15.086
Late and full of drink.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.339
There was a wound on his head
as if he'd slipped,

45:18.507 --> 45:20.675
as if he'd fallen out there in the dark.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.761
I can't forget his eyes.

45:23.929 --> 45:25.346
They were open,

45:25.514 --> 45:27.890
filled with surprise, with pain.

45:28.684 --> 45:30.810
Like the eyes of a fox I once saw.

45:31.353 --> 45:33.354
A fox the dogs had hunted down.

45:34.189 --> 45:36.399
But it was an accident?

45:36.567 --> 45:38.359
He was a peculiar man.

45:38.527 --> 45:43.281
There were things in his life that could account
for violence done him, vicious things.

45:44.241 --> 45:47.118
Well, it doesn't do to speak ill of the dead.

45:47.286 --> 45:49.162
The children never mention him.

45:49.329 --> 45:52.707
Oh, no, miss, and neither must you, not to them.

45:52.875 --> 45:55.501
You see, miss,
it was Master Miles that found him.

45:55.669 --> 45:59.130
Oh, that poor little boy.
If you could have heard his screams,

45:59.298 --> 46:01.758
seen the way he clung to him
and begged him to speak.

46:01.925 --> 46:04.510
That poor little boy worshipped Quint.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.095
Worshipped him?

46:06.263 --> 46:08.097
That man? Miles?

46:08.265 --> 46:10.725
You didn't know Quint, miss.

46:11.643 --> 46:14.103
Such power he had over people.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.522
You can't blame the child.

46:16.690 --> 46:19.650
A lonely boy with no father.
Quint took advantage, that's all.

46:19.818 --> 46:23.529
It made me sick to see Miles trotting after him
like a little dog.

46:23.697 --> 46:25.656
They were always together.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.658
MILES: Quiet, everyone!

46:27.826 --> 46:30.411
The entertainment is about to commence.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.455
Oh, look, miss.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.959
I’ve borrowed your pin cushion.
I hope you don't mind.

46:37.127 --> 46:39.086
(Music box plays O Willow Waly)

46:39.254 --> 46:42.215
Miss Giddens, dear, would you sit there?

46:42.382 --> 46:45.384
And Mrs Grose, would you sit there, too?

46:49.389 --> 46:52.099
And now, Miles will recite to you.

46:55.979 --> 46:57.355
A poem.

46:58.232 --> 47:01.692
What shall I sing to my lord from my window?

47:01.860 --> 47:05.822
What shall I sing, for my lord will not stay?

47:05.989 --> 47:09.826
What shall I sing, for my lord will not listen?

47:09.993 --> 47:13.830
Where shall I go, for my lord is away?

47:15.165 --> 47:18.793
Whom shall I love when the moon is arisen?

47:19.711 --> 47:23.047
Gone is my lord, and the grave is his prison.

47:24.216 --> 47:27.635
What shall I say when my lord comes a-calling?

47:28.637 --> 47:31.681
What shall I say when he knocks on my door?

47:32.683 --> 47:36.477
What shall I say when his feet enter softly,

47:37.271 --> 47:40.565
leaving the marks of his grave on my floor?

47:41.358 --> 47:43.401
Enter, my lord.

47:43.569 --> 47:45.528
Come from your prison.

47:45.696 --> 47:48.531
Come from your grave.

47:48.699 --> 47:51.534
For the moon is arisen.

47:52.452 --> 47:54.745
Welcome, my lord.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.215
- (Whispers) Look at that!
- What, miss?

48:06.383 --> 48:08.259
I was afraid for them.

48:08.427 --> 48:11.470
But what if he knows? What if Miles knows?

48:11.638 --> 48:13.931
Knows what, Miss Giddens, dear?

48:14.725 --> 48:18.895
You think I’m imagining it. And yet, just now,
you yourself saw and heard Miles...

48:19.062 --> 48:20.646
..playing a game.

48:22.482 --> 48:25.610
You told me
Quint and Miles were always together.

48:25.777 --> 48:28.529
- But Miles wasn't to blame.
- Couldn't you have stopped it?

48:28.697 --> 48:32.325
I wasn't in charge. It wasn't for me
to question the master's arrangements.

48:32.492 --> 48:34.327
The master put Quint in charge here.

48:34.494 --> 48:38.539
Besides, no-one could go against Quint.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.792
You were afraid of him?

48:45.130 --> 48:46.839
But what of Miss Jessel?

48:47.007 --> 48:51.218
Couldn't she have done something or...
was she afraid of him, too?

48:51.386 --> 48:53.346
Not at first. At least...

48:53.513 --> 48:57.558
In the beginning, when she first came here,
she was always happy and smiling.

48:57.726 --> 49:01.354
Very fond of music, she was, and dancing.

49:02.272 --> 49:05.691
She and Miss Flora used to dance together,
dance by the hour.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.110
But she changed.

49:08.278 --> 49:10.237
Oh, yes, she changed.

49:10.948 --> 49:14.325
It was hard to believe, her being
an educated young lady and Quint being...

49:14.493 --> 49:16.953
- (Children laugh)
- ..well, what he was.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.497
FLORA: Stop it, Miles! Stop it! (Shrieks)

49:19.665 --> 49:22.625
I knew they'd be overexcited.
It’s long past their bedtime.

49:22.793 --> 49:25.878
Yes, but what did you mean
about Quint and Miss Jessel?

49:26.046 --> 49:28.756
Look, miss, they're dead, gone.

49:28.924 --> 49:32.259
There's no point in telling tales
of what's over and done with.

49:37.766 --> 49:39.850
Over and done with...

49:42.813 --> 49:44.897
Yes, but is it?

50:11.258 --> 50:13.342
(Children giggle)

50:15.846 --> 50:18.180
MILES: Let go, Flora, you'll fall in.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.224
FLORA: But I want to row the boat.

50:20.392 --> 50:22.143
Silly, you know you can't.

50:22.310 --> 50:24.937
Miss Giddens, tell Miles to let me row.

50:25.105 --> 50:29.316
I will, when you're a little older.
But it's too heavy for you now.

50:29.484 --> 50:32.903
I don't care. I’ve got a boat of my own anyway.

50:37.367 --> 50:39.201
(Sighs)

50:39.369 --> 50:41.454
Heavenly, warm sun.

50:42.372 --> 50:43.998
It’s almost hot.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.250
I like it when it's hot.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.170
Do you know what Miles told me once?

50:49.337 --> 50:50.755
No, dear. What?

50:50.922 --> 50:53.966
He said, when he was on the lake,
he saw a hand waving on the bottom.

50:54.134 --> 50:57.553
But Mrs Grose said,
"Stuff and nonsense! Stuff and nonsense!"

51:03.435 --> 51:05.644
Miss Giddens, can tortoises swim?

51:05.812 --> 51:07.438
No, dear.

51:08.398 --> 51:10.232
I thought perhaps they couldn't.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.864
(Hums O Willow Waly)

51:22.496 --> 51:24.663
Flora, where did you learn that song?

51:26.625 --> 51:28.584
I don't think I remember.

51:28.752 --> 51:30.836
(Continues humming)

51:32.798 --> 51:35.216
It’s the song from the music box, isn't it?

51:37.219 --> 51:38.844
Isn’t it?

52:03.453 --> 52:05.121
Flora!

52:06.373 --> 52:07.790
Who is it?

52:08.041 --> 52:09.333
Over there!

52:43.785 --> 52:47.162
Oh, goodness, miss, you gave me quite a turn,
sitting there in the dark.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.998
And where are the children?

52:49.165 --> 52:51.125
Upstairs with Anna.

52:51.293 --> 52:53.961
I wanted to be by myself for a while.

52:55.088 --> 52:56.297
To think.

52:56.464 --> 52:59.925
Well, miss, I’m sure a little light will make
your thoughts more cheerful.

53:00.093 --> 53:02.052
Mrs Grose...

53:02.220 --> 53:04.179
there are two of them.

53:04.347 --> 53:06.181
I beg your pardon?

53:07.183 --> 53:11.228
Two of those...abominations.

53:12.564 --> 53:15.691
Today, down by the lake,

53:15.859 --> 53:18.986
there in the broad sunlight,

53:19.195 --> 53:21.405
I saw the other one.

53:21.573 --> 53:22.907
The other one?

53:23.074 --> 53:25.326
A woman dressed in black.

53:26.786 --> 53:28.329
Miss Jessel.

53:28.538 --> 53:33.000
But Miss Jessel's dead.
She died, why, almost a year ago.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.586
Almost a year ago.

53:35.795 --> 53:38.172
Almost a year!

53:39.090 --> 53:41.050
Flora saw her, too.

53:41.217 --> 53:44.553
- Did she tell you so?
- No, of course not. She lied to me.

53:44.721 --> 53:46.221
Well, it amounted to a lie.

53:46.389 --> 53:50.142
Oh, now, miss, I’ve never known
either of the children to tell lies.

53:50.352 --> 53:52.144
- Why would they?
- Why?

53:52.312 --> 53:54.980
Because they are both playing,

53:55.148 --> 53:58.692
or being made to play, some monstrous game.

53:58.860 --> 54:04.031
I can't pretend to understand what
its purpose is. I only know that it is happening.

54:04.199 --> 54:06.784
Something secretive

54:06.993 --> 54:08.786
and whispery...

54:09.746 --> 54:11.705
..and indecent.

54:11.873 --> 54:15.876
I tell you, believe me,
the children are in dreadful peril.

54:16.044 --> 54:17.836
What are we to do?

54:18.755 --> 54:20.714
Then you do believe me?

54:20.882 --> 54:22.758
You don't think I’m imagining it?

54:22.926 --> 54:25.010
I believe you, miss.

54:25.178 --> 54:27.554
Oh, thank God, thank God.

54:27.764 --> 54:29.974
I’ve been so frightened.

54:30.141 --> 54:31.558
I’ve felt so alone.

54:31.726 --> 54:34.186
But together, with you to help me...

54:34.354 --> 54:36.772
Oh, yes, miss, I’ll help you. Only, tell me how.

54:36.940 --> 54:38.065
Yes.

54:39.067 --> 54:43.904
We must try to learn what it is
these horrors want.

54:46.366 --> 54:50.577
Think, Mrs Grose.
The answer must lie in the past.

54:53.081 --> 54:57.459
Were Quint and Miss Jessel...in love?

55:01.548 --> 55:03.590
They were in love, weren't they?

55:03.758 --> 55:05.050
Love?

55:05.260 --> 55:07.428
Oh, I suppose that's what she called it.

55:07.595 --> 55:09.680
But it was more like a sickness,

55:09.848 --> 55:14.309
a fever that leaves the body
burned-out and dry.

55:14.477 --> 55:17.396
There was no cruelty she wouldn't suffer.

55:17.564 --> 55:21.191
If he struck her - oh, yes,
and I have seen him knock her to the floor -

55:21.359 --> 55:25.320
she'd look at him
as though she wanted the weight of his hand.

55:25.488 --> 55:28.073
No pride, no shame.

55:28.742 --> 55:31.118
Crawl to him on her hands and knees,
she would.

55:31.286 --> 55:34.997
And him laughing at her.
Such a savage laugh, he had.

55:35.832 --> 55:38.625
It hurts me to remember.

55:39.919 --> 55:44.048
Bad, she was,
but...no woman could have suffered more.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.968
A person ought to keep quiet about it.

55:48.928 --> 55:50.429
You must tell me.

55:51.222 --> 55:53.265
Miss, there's things I’ve seen, I...

55:53.433 --> 55:55.642
I’m ashamed to say.

55:55.852 --> 55:56.977
Go on!

55:59.898 --> 56:01.315
Rooms...

56:01.483 --> 56:03.942
used by daylight...

56:04.986 --> 56:07.613
..as though they were dark woods.

56:10.325 --> 56:12.785
They didn't care that you saw them?

56:15.330 --> 56:17.081
And the children?

56:17.999 --> 56:19.958
I can't say, miss.

56:20.126 --> 56:22.628
I don't know what the children saw.

56:23.505 --> 56:25.714
But they used to follow Quint and Miss Jessel,

56:25.924 --> 56:28.550
trailing along behind, hand in hand, whispering.

56:28.718 --> 56:31.220
There was too much whispering
in this house, miss.

56:31.387 --> 56:33.806
Oh, yes, I can imagine.

56:34.766 --> 56:38.977
Yes, I can imagine
what sort of things they whispered about.

56:39.145 --> 56:41.563
Quint, Miles.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.066
I can hear them together.

56:44.234 --> 56:47.361
But there was nothing wrong
in Master Miles wanting to be with Quint.

56:47.529 --> 56:50.030
Quint taught him to ride and took him walking.

56:50.198 --> 56:53.117
- The poor lad needed someone...
- ..to corrupt him?

56:53.284 --> 56:57.079
But Master Miles is a good boy, miss.
There's nothing wicked in him.

56:57.247 --> 57:00.582
Unless he's deceiving us.
Unless they're both deceiving us.

57:00.750 --> 57:02.668
The innocents.

57:02.836 --> 57:06.380
Innocents, they are, miss. It’s not fair.
You have no right to accuse them...

57:06.589 --> 57:11.510
Forgive me, Mrs Grose. I’m not accusing,
I’m just trying to put it together,

57:11.719 --> 57:13.887
to understand.

57:14.055 --> 57:17.307
Tell me, were the children happy?

57:17.475 --> 57:19.434
They seemed to be, the same as now.

57:19.602 --> 57:23.230
But sometimes I used to wonder
if they really cared for them, those two.

57:23.398 --> 57:26.441
Or if they weren't just using them.

57:27.652 --> 57:29.570
Using them?

57:30.864 --> 57:33.073
Yes, of course they were,

57:33.241 --> 57:35.325
and still are.

57:36.744 --> 57:39.204
And in the end,
what happened to her, Miss Jessel?

57:39.372 --> 57:41.582
Oh, that was pitiful.

57:42.667 --> 57:46.128
When Quint was found,
she went into blackest mourning.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.797
Her that should have hated the man.

57:49.716 --> 57:52.968
She grieved
till there was something crazy in her eyes.

57:53.136 --> 57:55.095
Never slept, never ate.

57:55.305 --> 57:59.224
I used to hear her wandering about
all over the house, sobbing.

58:00.518 --> 58:02.436
It couldn't go on.

58:03.271 --> 58:04.730
Finally, she died.

58:04.898 --> 58:05.981
Here?

58:06.149 --> 58:07.941
At Bly?

58:08.109 --> 58:09.860
But of what did she die?

58:10.778 --> 58:13.906
- I suppose you might say a broken heart.
- (Door opens)

58:14.115 --> 58:18.535
Excuse me, miss. They're in bed.
All scrubbed and waiting for you to hear their prayer.

58:18.703 --> 58:21.205
Thank you, Anna. I shall be up in a moment.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.791
- (Door closes)
- One thing more before I go.

58:24.959 --> 58:27.211
- Yes?
- Our local vicar, what sort of man is he?

58:27.378 --> 58:30.923
The Reverend Fennell?
Oh, he's a very fine sort of gentleman, miss.

58:31.090 --> 58:33.175
Oh, but, miss, I wouldn't do that.

58:33.343 --> 58:37.221
I mean, if you were thinking of discussing
with the vicar what we've been discussing,

58:37.388 --> 58:39.014
I wouldn't, miss.

58:39.182 --> 58:43.560
- Why not?
- Well, it might cause talk, a scandal.

58:43.728 --> 58:46.146
Haven't we worse to fear than a scandal?

58:46.356 --> 58:50.067
But what good would it do, miss,
telling the vicar our secrets?

58:50.235 --> 58:52.152
He can't help us.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.529
He's perhaps the only one who can.

59:00.995 --> 59:02.955
(Whimpers softly)

59:03.122 --> 59:07.417
MRS GROSE: But what good would it do, miss,
telling the vicar our secrets?

59:07.585 --> 59:09.378
He can't help us.

59:09.545 --> 59:14.091
MISS GIDDENS: Only, remember,
you are in supreme authority.

59:14.259 --> 59:16.718
(Whispers) Sh, Flora! It’s a secret.

59:16.886 --> 59:19.638
You must remember, it's a secret.

59:19.806 --> 59:21.723
(Confused echo of voices)

59:28.273 --> 59:32.985
Watch her.

59:33.695 --> 59:35.654
Flora, it's a secret...

59:35.822 --> 59:37.906
(Flora laughs)

59:41.744 --> 59:43.829
(They giggle)

59:51.004 --> 59:53.088
(Flutter of wings)

1:00:03.266 --> 1:00:05.183
It’s a secret...

1:00:05.393 --> 1:00:06.852
A secret...

1:00:11.232 --> 1:00:13.191
♪ Tune of O Willow Waly

1:00:13.359 --> 1:00:15.444
(Music echoes and fractures)

1:00:27.123 --> 1:00:29.207
(Church bell tolls)

1:00:35.631 --> 1:00:37.758
- (Children laugh)
- I’ve made up my mind.

1:00:37.925 --> 1:00:41.803
Right after church, I shall take the next train to London
and see their uncle.

1:00:41.971 --> 1:00:44.973
- He must have returned.
- But why, miss? Why now?

1:00:45.141 --> 1:00:46.516
Because I...

1:00:46.684 --> 1:00:49.394
We can go on no longer without help.

1:00:49.562 --> 1:00:51.229
I know you're almost sick with worry,

1:00:51.397 --> 1:00:54.691
but, except for odd times,
you can't say the children haven't been good.

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:57.986
But they haven't been good,
merely easy to live with.

1:00:58.154 --> 1:01:01.865
Because they are not living with us.
We have no part in their real life.

1:01:02.033 --> 1:01:05.660
Dear Mrs Grose, I know it's hard for you
to think wrong of those children.

1:01:05.828 --> 1:01:09.581
But there are things that I haven't told you,

1:01:09.791 --> 1:01:13.251
that I can't bring myself to tell even you.

1:01:14.545 --> 1:01:15.796
Look at them.

1:01:16.005 --> 1:01:18.131
What do you think they're saying?

1:01:18.299 --> 1:01:20.842
Well, I don't know, miss, just children's talk.

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:22.844
They're talking about them.

1:01:23.012 --> 1:01:25.097
Talking horrors.

1:01:26.891 --> 1:01:29.518
So far, these monsters have kept their distance,

1:01:29.685 --> 1:01:33.605
only been seen in high places,
through windows, across the lake.

1:01:33.815 --> 1:01:36.191
But they intend coming closer.

1:01:36.359 --> 1:01:38.235
And if they do...

1:01:38.403 --> 1:01:41.196
- What will you say to the master?
- Well, what can I say?

1:01:41.364 --> 1:01:43.490
That his house is being poisoned?

1:01:43.658 --> 1:01:46.785
That the children are a pair of calculating liars?

1:01:46.953 --> 1:01:49.830
That they have friends who would frighten them out of their lives

1:01:49.997 --> 1:01:52.332
if they weren't deeply
and forever bound to them?

1:01:52.542 --> 1:01:55.001
Oh, yes, I know, he'll think I’m insane

1:01:55.169 --> 1:01:58.755
or that it's some stupid trick
to get him to notice me.

1:01:58.923 --> 1:02:01.133
I wish there was something I could do to help.

1:02:01.300 --> 1:02:02.801
There is.

1:02:02.969 --> 1:02:05.137
Have you told me everything?

1:02:05.304 --> 1:02:07.722
If I am to convince their uncle,

1:02:07.890 --> 1:02:11.143
I must have the truth, all the truth.

1:02:12.186 --> 1:02:14.229
How did Miss Jessel die?

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:16.481
Please, miss, we'll be late.

1:02:18.943 --> 1:02:21.027
How did she die?

1:02:23.406 --> 1:02:24.865
In wickedness.

1:02:25.950 --> 1:02:30.036
She put an end to herself.
She was found in the lake, drowned.

1:02:31.956 --> 1:02:34.624
Oh, I’m sorry, miss,
I should never have told you.

1:02:34.792 --> 1:02:36.877
I’m glad you did.

1:02:38.212 --> 1:02:41.256
Oh, go in, Mrs Grose.
I’ll follow you in a moment.

1:02:41.424 --> 1:02:43.508
(Organ music)

1:03:16.834 --> 1:03:18.084
Flora!

1:03:26.844 --> 1:03:30.931
I do wish you wouldn't go, miss. It seems wrong somehow,
you hurrying off like this.

1:03:31.098 --> 1:03:32.891
I’m left with no choice.

1:03:33.059 --> 1:03:34.726
Thank you, Mrs Grose.

1:03:34.894 --> 1:03:40.232
There's nothing else to be done,
except to tell their uncle everything, force him to understand.

1:03:40.399 --> 1:03:42.108
Did you order the carriage for me?

1:03:42.276 --> 1:03:45.946
I did. I’ll see if it's come round.
I’ll get someone to take your luggage down.

1:03:46.113 --> 1:03:48.406
Thank you. I shall be in the schoolroom.

1:03:52.161 --> 1:03:54.246
(Fly buzzes)

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.884
(Sobbing)

1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:49.884
(Fly's buzzing fades back in)

1:05:04.233 --> 1:05:06.151
MRS GROSE: Miss Giddens?

1:05:07.069 --> 1:05:09.154
Miss Giddens?

1:05:10.615 --> 1:05:12.699
(School desk slams shut)

1:05:18.414 --> 1:05:19.539
(Knocks)

1:05:21.709 --> 1:05:23.501
Are you ready, miss?

1:05:23.669 --> 1:05:25.629
I’m not going.

1:05:25.796 --> 1:05:27.881
Everything has changed.

1:05:28.049 --> 1:05:30.133
Are you ill?

1:05:32.053 --> 1:05:34.971
- Where are the children?
- Anna's giving them their milk.

1:05:35.139 --> 1:05:36.765
The carriage is ready, miss.

1:05:36.932 --> 1:05:39.476
From now on,
we must never let them out of our sight.

1:05:39.644 --> 1:05:43.146
- We can't take the slightest chance.
- Of what?

1:05:44.565 --> 1:05:46.149
She was here.

1:05:46.359 --> 1:05:48.276
She was waiting for me.

1:05:48.486 --> 1:05:49.944
Who?

1:05:50.112 --> 1:05:51.821
She spoke.

1:05:52.948 --> 1:05:55.784
- She spoke?
- It came to that.

1:05:57.203 --> 1:05:59.663
Oh, I could feel pity for her,

1:05:59.872 --> 1:06:04.209
if she herself were not so pitiless...

1:06:05.961 --> 1:06:09.381
..and hungry, hungry for him.

1:06:10.883 --> 1:06:14.135
For his arms, for his lips.

1:06:15.096 --> 1:06:17.347
But she can only reach him...

1:06:17.556 --> 1:06:22.560
They can only reach each other by entering
the souls of the children and possessing them.

1:06:26.273 --> 1:06:28.358
The children are possessed.

1:06:30.569 --> 1:06:33.029
They live and know

1:06:33.239 --> 1:06:36.908
and share this hell.

1:06:37.076 --> 1:06:38.993
Then surely you must tell the master?

1:06:39.161 --> 1:06:40.787
I can't leave them now.

1:06:40.955 --> 1:06:43.790
I shall write to him
and insist upon his coming down here.

1:06:45.042 --> 1:06:47.377
But even if he chooses to ignore me,

1:06:47.545 --> 1:06:49.170
with or without his help,

1:06:49.338 --> 1:06:51.548
I think I know how we can save them.

1:06:51.716 --> 1:06:52.924
Yes, miss?

1:06:53.092 --> 1:06:55.552
They must be made to admit what is happening.

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:58.638
One word - one word -
of the truth from these children

1:06:58.806 --> 1:07:01.391
and we can cast out those devils forever.

1:07:01.559 --> 1:07:04.144
I pray to God you're right, miss.

1:07:46.228 --> 1:07:48.313
(Faint echo of piano playing)

1:07:52.401 --> 1:07:54.486
(Screech outside)

1:07:57.072 --> 1:08:00.408
WOMAN'S VOICE: Softly...
The children are listening.

1:08:04.455 --> 1:08:06.539
(Giggling)

1:08:23.933 --> 1:08:26.017
(Creaking)

1:08:44.495 --> 1:08:46.579
(Clattering)

1:09:05.182 --> 1:09:07.225
(Confused echo of Mrs Grose's voice)

1:09:07.393 --> 1:09:10.144
Can't forget his eyes. They were open.

1:09:10.312 --> 1:09:13.982
MILES: What shall I say
when his feet enter softly,

1:09:14.149 --> 1:09:17.694
leaving the marks of his grave on my floor?

1:09:26.912 --> 1:09:28.872
(Wind whistles)

1:09:29.039 --> 1:09:31.124
(Door creaks open)

1:09:39.842 --> 1:09:43.887
WOMAN'S VOICE: Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me...

1:10:09.997 --> 1:10:12.081
(Woman's laughter)

1:10:17.463 --> 1:10:19.547
(Rattles handle)

1:10:24.386 --> 1:10:26.471
MAN'S VOICE: Look at the children.

1:10:27.765 --> 1:10:29.515
MAN: Look at the children.

1:10:29.683 --> 1:10:31.768
(Woman laughs)

1:10:41.654 --> 1:10:43.738
FLORA: You're hurting me.

1:10:46.158 --> 1:10:48.242
(Door creaks shut)

1:10:55.834 --> 1:10:57.919
(Ripple of laughter)

1:11:03.676 --> 1:11:05.510
(Door slams shut)

1:11:05.719 --> 1:11:07.804
(Reverberating echo)

1:11:10.683 --> 1:11:12.976
WOMAN'S VOICE:
The children are watching.

1:11:13.143 --> 1:11:15.687
- (Tune of O Willow Waly)
- The children are watching.

1:11:15.854 --> 1:11:17.939
The children are watching!

1:11:18.857 --> 1:11:22.068
MAN: Haven't they taught you?
Knock before you enter!

1:11:23.779 --> 1:11:27.448
WOMAN: Knock before...
MAN: Knock before you enter!

1:11:27.616 --> 1:11:29.117
(Hammering)

1:11:29.284 --> 1:11:31.244
(Babble of voices)

1:11:31.412 --> 1:11:34.706
WOMAN: Knock before you enter!
Knock before you enter!

1:11:34.873 --> 1:11:36.958
(Voices rise to a crescendo)

1:11:41.463 --> 1:11:43.548
(Frantic tapping)

1:11:44.717 --> 1:11:46.801
(Tap-tap of curtain puller)

1:11:50.723 --> 1:11:52.807
WOMAN: Love me, love me...

1:11:54.518 --> 1:11:57.645
Love me, love me! (Screams)

1:11:57.813 --> 1:11:59.856
(Children's laughter)

1:12:06.030 --> 1:12:08.698
MRS GROSE: Quint is dead.
MISS GIDDENS: Dead?

1:12:22.671 --> 1:12:31.179
Flora!

1:12:31.346 --> 1:12:34.265
(Whispers) Somebody's walking in the garden.

1:12:41.065 --> 1:12:43.149
(Echoes) Miles!

1:13:10.761 --> 1:13:12.178
(Door closes)

1:13:33.867 --> 1:13:36.035
- Miles, what were you doing?
- When?

1:13:36.203 --> 1:13:38.454
You were looking at the tower.
You saw something.

1:13:38.622 --> 1:13:39.997
- Of course.
- What did you see?

1:13:40.165 --> 1:13:42.959
Only you, Miss Giddens. I was waiting for you.

1:13:43.127 --> 1:13:44.585
Waiting?

1:13:44.795 --> 1:13:46.754
Oh, I knew you'd look out.

1:13:46.922 --> 1:13:49.006
Don't you want to know why?

1:13:50.134 --> 1:13:52.468
I’ll tell you the real, true reason.

1:13:52.636 --> 1:13:55.972
- But I wonder if you'll understand?
- I’ll try.

1:13:56.181 --> 1:13:58.099
Well, put me back to bed, then.

1:13:58.308 --> 1:14:01.477
If you're not too cross? Are you cross?

1:14:01.645 --> 1:14:03.980
- Yes, I am.
- I thought you would be.

1:14:04.148 --> 1:14:06.566
Come on, I’ll tell you when I’m in bed.

1:14:09.027 --> 1:14:10.945
- Well now...
- Yes?

1:14:11.113 --> 1:14:13.364
I wanted you to think me bad for a change.

1:14:13.532 --> 1:14:15.074
For a change?

1:14:15.242 --> 1:14:17.869
Well, I thought I might be becoming a bore.

1:14:19.413 --> 1:14:21.622
Miles, tell me the truth.

1:14:21.790 --> 1:14:23.374
But I am.

1:14:23.542 --> 1:14:27.378
I mean, good children do get a bit boring, don't they?

1:14:27.546 --> 1:14:32.258
So I thought, "Why not go out for the night
and wander about in my bare feet?"

1:14:32.426 --> 1:14:34.677
It was a shocking thing to do, wasn't it?

1:14:38.056 --> 1:14:39.932
Yes, very shocking.

1:14:40.100 --> 1:14:43.519
Well, that was our plan.
Flora and I arranged it together.

1:14:43.687 --> 1:14:45.188
We giggled so.

1:14:45.355 --> 1:14:47.315
I was sure you must have heard us.

1:14:47.482 --> 1:14:48.858
Yes, I...

1:14:49.026 --> 1:14:50.735
I did hear something.

1:14:50.903 --> 1:14:54.906
I told her to go over to the window.
Then you'd be bound to look out and see me.

1:14:55.824 --> 1:14:57.742
Flora's been bad as well.

1:14:59.536 --> 1:15:02.079
Miles, what are you hiding under your pillow?

1:15:02.247 --> 1:15:05.291
I’m not hiding it. I’m keeping it warm.

1:15:06.126 --> 1:15:09.503
I found it this morning. One of my pigeons.

1:15:09.671 --> 1:15:11.088
I couldn't, could I,

1:15:11.256 --> 1:15:12.757
leave it out there alone?

1:15:12.966 --> 1:15:14.842
But, Miles...

1:15:15.052 --> 1:15:16.928
Its neck.

1:15:19.306 --> 1:15:22.058
- It looks as though...
- Someone had broken it.

1:15:26.271 --> 1:15:28.856
Yes, poor thing. I’ll bury it tomorrow.

1:15:31.568 --> 1:15:33.653
Kiss me good night, Miss Giddens.

1:15:56.885 --> 1:15:58.970
(Plays tune of O Willow Waly)

1:16:02.849 --> 1:16:05.142
Are you writing to your sister, Miss Giddens?

1:16:05.310 --> 1:16:07.395
No, Miles, to your uncle.

1:16:07.562 --> 1:16:10.022
I knew you would, finally.

1:16:11.775 --> 1:16:13.776
Did you?

1:16:13.944 --> 1:16:17.488
I suppose you're telling him
what a wicked boy I’ve been?

1:16:18.949 --> 1:16:21.784
It concerns you in part, yes.

1:16:21.952 --> 1:16:25.288
Well, do be sure and give him my love.

1:16:28.292 --> 1:16:32.378
Miles, isn't that the tune
that Flora's always singing?

1:16:32.546 --> 1:16:34.630
Do you like it?

1:16:41.346 --> 1:16:43.431
Where's Flora?

1:16:44.474 --> 1:16:46.392
Isn’t she here?

1:16:46.601 --> 1:16:48.894
Shall I play you something else?

1:16:51.148 --> 1:16:52.440
Flora?

1:16:55.193 --> 1:16:58.904
Flora!

1:16:59.823 --> 1:17:02.450
Mrs Grose! Mrs Grose, Flora, she's gone!

1:17:02.617 --> 1:17:05.244
Miles planned it beautifully.
Yes, it was very clever.

1:17:05.412 --> 1:17:06.996
- Quick, we must find her!
- Where?

1:17:07.164 --> 1:17:10.333
By the lake where we picnic,
where we saw Miss Jessel.

1:17:12.627 --> 1:17:16.005
- You see, she's taken the boat.
- All alone? That child?

1:17:16.173 --> 1:17:19.342
She's not alone,
and at such times, she's not a child.

1:17:19.509 --> 1:17:21.677
- She's an old, old woman.
- (Thunder)

1:17:23.847 --> 1:17:25.931
(Music box plays O Willow Waly)

1:18:17.651 --> 1:18:19.110
(Thunderclap)

1:18:29.246 --> 1:18:30.496
Flora.

1:18:30.664 --> 1:18:32.289
Oh, there you are.

1:18:32.457 --> 1:18:34.542
I thought someone was watching me.

1:18:35.419 --> 1:18:37.378
And who did you think it was?

1:18:38.130 --> 1:18:40.381
Why, Miss Giddens,
you came out without your hat.

1:18:40.549 --> 1:18:41.924
So did you.

1:18:42.092 --> 1:18:44.009
(Thunder)

1:18:44.177 --> 1:18:46.095
How did you get here, dear?

1:18:46.263 --> 1:18:48.931
- In the boat.
MRS GROSE: Miss! Miss Giddens!

1:18:49.099 --> 1:18:52.017
And when did you learn to row, Flora?

1:18:53.603 --> 1:18:55.688
Miles taught me.

1:18:57.315 --> 1:18:59.150
Why did you come here?

1:18:59.317 --> 1:19:02.486
I always come here, when I want to dance,
when I want to be alone.

1:19:03.822 --> 1:19:06.490
And who gave you that music box?

1:19:06.658 --> 1:19:08.617
I don't think I remember.

1:19:08.785 --> 1:19:10.453
MRS GROSE: Miss Giddens!

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:12.580
Oh, yes, I do, it was Mrs Grose.

1:19:12.747 --> 1:19:16.167
- No, it was not.
- Wasn't it, Miss Giddens, dear?

1:19:17.461 --> 1:19:20.713
And where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?

1:19:20.881 --> 1:19:23.841
- (Thunderclap)
- Where is she, Flora?

1:19:24.843 --> 1:19:26.302
Miss Giddens!

1:19:27.345 --> 1:19:29.305
Where is she? You know you can see her!

1:19:29.473 --> 1:19:31.307
- Miss!
- Look, Flora, look!

1:19:31.475 --> 1:19:34.310
There! You know you can see her!

1:19:34.478 --> 1:19:36.312
- I can't! I can't!
- Admit it!

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:38.647
She's there! You know you can see her!

1:19:38.815 --> 1:19:41.192
- I can't! I can't!
- But look, she's there!

1:19:41.359 --> 1:19:45.112
- Miss Giddens, I’m frightened! (Sobs)
- Stop it, miss.

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.615
But you can see her!

1:19:47.782 --> 1:19:49.074
You must!

1:19:49.242 --> 1:19:53.329
Hush, hush, dear, hush.
She isn't there. How could she be?

1:19:53.497 --> 1:19:55.581
She's dead and buried. Hush, dear.

1:19:55.790 --> 1:19:57.583
I can't see anything!

1:19:57.751 --> 1:20:00.419
I’ve never seen anything!
You're cruel, you're wicked!

1:20:00.587 --> 1:20:03.172
- I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
- Flora!

1:20:03.340 --> 1:20:05.007
Take me away from her!

1:20:05.217 --> 1:20:08.010
She's cruel. Take me away!
Please take me away!

1:20:08.929 --> 1:20:12.681
Don't look at her, don't look at her!
She frightens me so! (Screams)

1:20:13.975 --> 1:20:16.393
- Hush, dear. Come on.
- (Screaming sobs)

1:20:17.604 --> 1:20:19.772
- Mrs Grose...
- Come on, child.

1:20:23.527 --> 1:20:25.611
Come along.

1:20:28.490 --> 1:20:30.574
(Thunderclap)

1:21:15.829 --> 1:21:18.747
I like it when the fire does that.

1:21:18.957 --> 1:21:21.083
Don't you?

1:21:38.018 --> 1:21:40.185
(Flora screams and sobs)

1:21:51.865 --> 1:21:53.949
(Sobbing continues)

1:21:56.995 --> 1:21:59.079
(Flora screams repeatedly)

1:22:10.258 --> 1:22:12.926
MRS GROSE: Sh! Hush, my love.
Anna will stay with you.

1:22:13.136 --> 1:22:15.095
(Flora lets out piercing shriek)

1:22:15.263 --> 1:22:17.348
(Her sobbing echoes)

1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:33.155
I’ve never known the equal, never.
It’s beyond nature.

1:22:33.323 --> 1:22:36.492
- Now do you believe me, now you've seen?
- Now that I’ve heard.

1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:40.954
ln all my years, and I’ve known a vile tongue or two,
never have I heard such obscenities.

1:22:42.582 --> 1:22:45.459
- That pleases you?
- No, of course not.

1:22:45.627 --> 1:22:47.419
But it justifies me. It’s proof.

1:22:47.587 --> 1:22:51.840
Perhaps it is, but to hear such filth
from a child's mouth.

1:22:52.008 --> 1:22:54.718
I don't know
where she could have learned such language.

1:22:54.886 --> 1:22:55.969
I know.

1:22:56.137 --> 1:22:59.014
I’ve never heard her speak like it before, never, till you came.

1:22:59.182 --> 1:23:02.226
You saw who taught her. You saw that woman.

1:23:02.394 --> 1:23:04.478
I know what I saw.

1:23:05.522 --> 1:23:08.565
Has she mentioned it? Mentioned Miss Jessel?

1:23:08.733 --> 1:23:11.944
- Only to say there was no-one there.
- And you pretended to believe her?

1:23:12.112 --> 1:23:13.862
I didn't have to pretend.

1:23:16.658 --> 1:23:18.742
Well, how can you say that?

1:23:19.619 --> 1:23:23.497
As though you...
you, too, were a complete innocent?

1:23:23.707 --> 1:23:26.500
Well, you lived here, you knew those two.

1:23:26.668 --> 1:23:30.671
You knew them and what sort of influence
they were on the children. It frightened you.

1:23:30.839 --> 1:23:34.049
When I came here, you were still frightened.
Oh, you were!

1:23:34.259 --> 1:23:39.430
I sensed it. And why?
Because you felt they weren't really dead!

1:23:39.597 --> 1:23:42.891
And now, despite all that, you turn on me.

1:23:43.059 --> 1:23:47.938
You blame me. All I want is to save the children, not destroy them.
Don't you know that?

1:23:48.106 --> 1:23:52.693
All I know is, Flora was a sweet, innocent child,
a happy child, until you made her face that...

1:23:52.902 --> 1:23:55.404
- That woman. Say it!
- That...

1:23:55.572 --> 1:23:56.989
bad memory!

1:23:57.699 --> 1:23:59.575
(Flora screams)

1:23:59.743 --> 1:24:01.994
It may have been the saving of her.

1:24:04.122 --> 1:24:06.081
But you must take her to her uncle.

1:24:06.249 --> 1:24:08.333
You must both go away tomorrow.

1:24:08.543 --> 1:24:11.962
Away from me, away from them, the servants, everyone must go.

1:24:12.130 --> 1:24:14.298
Leave you here all alone?

1:24:15.842 --> 1:24:18.343
Except for Miles.

1:24:20.013 --> 1:24:24.850
We were together this afternoon,
sitting in front of the fire.

1:24:25.769 --> 1:24:27.686
He didn't say anything.

1:24:27.854 --> 1:24:29.688
But he wanted to.

1:24:30.732 --> 1:24:32.483
It was like a pendulum.

1:24:32.650 --> 1:24:35.819
And I could feel it swinging my way,

1:24:35.987 --> 1:24:39.156
slowly, slowly.

1:24:39.324 --> 1:24:44.828
Oh, yes, he wanted to reveal himself
and ask for my help.

1:24:44.996 --> 1:24:47.372
And we must give him that chance.

1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:49.833
Don't you understand that?

1:24:50.043 --> 1:24:53.378
After today, I doubt I shall ever understand you. It was a cruel thing.

1:24:53.546 --> 1:24:57.049
- And if you're planning another cruelty...
- To wake a child out of a bad dream,

1:24:57.217 --> 1:24:58.550
is that a cruelty?

1:25:00.220 --> 1:25:04.348
If you were my age,
and had cared for as many children as I have,

1:25:05.016 --> 1:25:08.602
you'd know that waking a child
can sometimes be worse than any bad dream.

1:25:08.812 --> 1:25:10.479
- No.
- It’s the shock.

1:25:10.647 --> 1:25:14.066
- And then being suddenly deprived.
- No.

1:25:14.234 --> 1:25:16.360
No, you're wrong. You're talking nonsense!

1:25:16.528 --> 1:25:18.153
As you say, miss.

1:25:19.239 --> 1:25:21.073
You and Flora will leave tomorrow.

1:25:21.282 --> 1:25:23.283
It is my decision.

1:25:23.451 --> 1:25:29.206
I shall send the servants away.
He put me in charge, in sole charge, Mrs Grose.

1:25:29.916 --> 1:25:32.042
Tomorrow, I must be alone here.

1:25:32.210 --> 1:25:34.127
With Miles.

1:25:35.672 --> 1:25:38.549
Miss! May I ask what I’m to tell their uncle?

1:25:40.677 --> 1:25:42.553
The truth.

1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:44.555
The truth?

1:25:47.225 --> 1:25:48.642
Yes, miss.

1:25:48.810 --> 1:25:50.477
Thank you.

1:26:07.912 --> 1:26:11.456
- Mrs Grose, have you got my letter?
- What letter, miss?

1:26:11.624 --> 1:26:15.752
- To their uncle. I left it on the desk.
- I haven't touched it, miss.

1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:17.880
Well, I wonder who...

1:26:18.047 --> 1:26:20.841
Oh, of course. Miles.

1:26:21.009 --> 1:26:23.051
You're accusing him of stealing?

1:26:23.219 --> 1:26:27.431
Well, what matter? It’s just one thing more for us to talk about
when we're alone.

1:26:28.558 --> 1:26:31.643
- Where is Master Miles?
- He went out early this morning.

1:26:32.687 --> 1:26:34.771
But I shall wait for him.

1:26:34.939 --> 1:26:37.024
He'll come to me.

1:26:38.192 --> 1:26:42.404
Well, I...I suppose Miss Flora and I
had best be on our way.

1:26:44.449 --> 1:26:46.408
Give her my love...

1:26:46.618 --> 1:26:48.368
when she's better.

1:26:48.578 --> 1:26:51.496
And, Mrs Grose, please,

1:26:51.706 --> 1:26:55.542
wait till you see Miles again
before you judge me.

1:26:55.710 --> 1:26:57.920
I can't judge you, miss.

1:26:58.087 --> 1:27:00.923
A body can only judge themselves.

1:27:03.718 --> 1:27:05.719
May God be with you, miss!

1:27:12.393 --> 1:27:14.478
(Front door slams)

1:27:34.958 --> 1:27:36.458
(Driver cracks whip)

1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:40.272
(Thunder)

1:29:14.599 --> 1:29:16.683
(Cry of peacock)

1:29:27.653 --> 1:29:29.446
So, here you are.

1:29:29.614 --> 1:29:32.991
I say! Are we having tea in here?

1:29:33.159 --> 1:29:34.993
Yes, Miles.

1:29:35.161 --> 1:29:37.204
How very grand and grown-up.

1:29:37.371 --> 1:29:41.625
Yes, and we can talk together now, like adults.

1:29:41.793 --> 1:29:43.794
Jolly nice, I call it.

1:29:45.671 --> 1:29:48.590
I feel quite the master of the house.

1:29:49.634 --> 1:29:51.593
Where are the servants?

1:29:51.761 --> 1:29:53.512
They've gone home.

1:29:53.721 --> 1:29:55.305
Oh, did you send them?

1:29:55.473 --> 1:29:57.682
Or did they take fright and run away?

1:29:58.643 --> 1:30:00.018
What do you mean?

1:30:00.186 --> 1:30:03.897
Well, you're afraid.
And perhaps you made them so.

1:30:04.107 --> 1:30:08.276
And of what - assuming you are right -

1:30:08.444 --> 1:30:10.821
of what am I afraid, Miles?

1:30:10.988 --> 1:30:14.658
I’m not a mind reader, my dear.
I’ve told you that before.

1:30:14.826 --> 1:30:17.369
But I do sense things.

1:30:18.621 --> 1:30:21.456
Don't worry, there's a man in the house.

1:30:22.542 --> 1:30:23.959
- Is there?
- Yes.

1:30:24.127 --> 1:30:27.045
Me. I’ll protect you.

1:30:32.885 --> 1:30:35.512
(Giggles) I say, it is fun.

1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:38.348
We've got the whole house to ourselves.

1:30:38.516 --> 1:30:40.058
More or less.

1:30:40.226 --> 1:30:42.394
There are still the others.

1:30:44.605 --> 1:30:48.984
Poor Flora. Is she awfully ill?
I mean, is it serious?

1:30:49.152 --> 1:30:51.111
Has she gone to hospital?

1:30:51.279 --> 1:30:53.238
No, just to London.

1:30:53.406 --> 1:30:56.491
I think Bly didn't agree with her any more.

1:30:57.577 --> 1:30:59.161
This house upset her.

1:30:59.328 --> 1:31:00.245
Suddenly?

1:31:00.413 --> 1:31:02.164
Oh, no, I’d seen it coming on.

1:31:02.373 --> 1:31:03.707
Did you?

1:31:03.875 --> 1:31:05.417
Then why didn't l?

1:31:05.585 --> 1:31:06.835
I love Flora.

1:31:07.003 --> 1:31:09.754
And I know what she feels
before she feels it herself.

1:31:10.798 --> 1:31:13.800
She loved this house.

1:31:14.594 --> 1:31:17.095
She was as happy here...

1:31:17.263 --> 1:31:19.347
as happy as I am.

1:31:20.266 --> 1:31:21.433
Are you?

1:31:21.601 --> 1:31:22.684
What?

1:31:22.852 --> 1:31:24.603
So very happy?

1:31:27.565 --> 1:31:29.649
Are you, Miles?

1:31:32.236 --> 1:31:34.654
If you'll excuse me.

1:31:35.907 --> 1:31:36.865
Miles.

1:31:37.033 --> 1:31:39.117
- You haven't...
- (Door closes)

1:31:51.464 --> 1:31:55.508
Poor Flora. She must have been upset
to have forgotten Rupert.

1:32:00.556 --> 1:32:02.432
Why did you want to be alone with me?

1:32:03.643 --> 1:32:05.602
I think you know very well.

1:32:05.770 --> 1:32:07.520
What do I know?

1:32:07.730 --> 1:32:11.399
Or rather, what is it that you want to know?

1:32:12.652 --> 1:32:14.027
Well, for one thing,

1:32:14.195 --> 1:32:18.323
why, that night when you were supposed
to be in bed, why were you in the garden?

1:32:18.491 --> 1:32:22.410
- I told you.
- The real reason, Miles.

1:32:23.579 --> 1:32:27.207
It’s beyond me
why you go on asking a fellow questions,

1:32:27.375 --> 1:32:30.752
when every time he answers you,
you tell him it isn't true.

1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:33.255
Because you are not telling the truth!

1:32:33.422 --> 1:32:35.924
Don't shout! Don't be so angry.

1:32:36.092 --> 1:32:38.134
It does something to your face.

1:32:38.302 --> 1:32:41.304
It makes you look ugly and cruel.

1:32:41.472 --> 1:32:44.766
Miles, Miles, listen to me.

1:32:45.643 --> 1:32:47.477
I’m not a cruel person.

1:32:48.354 --> 1:32:52.315
I’m sometimes very foolish and I make mistakes but I’m not cruel.

1:32:54.026 --> 1:32:56.152
My father taught me to love people

1:32:56.320 --> 1:32:57.696
and help them,

1:32:57.863 --> 1:33:02.200
help them even if they refuse my help,
even if it hurt them sometimes.

1:33:02.368 --> 1:33:04.911
And that's the only reason I’m here,
is to help you.

1:33:05.079 --> 1:33:10.083
Whatever you've done, I’m not against you,
I don't think it's your fault.

1:33:10.251 --> 1:33:15.213
- But I haven't done anything!
- Then why were you sent home from school?

1:33:16.590 --> 1:33:18.550
It must be...

1:33:19.552 --> 1:33:21.928
- ..because I’m different.
- But you aren't!

1:33:22.096 --> 1:33:24.848
You're like any other boy!

1:33:25.850 --> 1:33:27.976
Ah, now who isn't telling the truth?

1:33:28.144 --> 1:33:32.605
If you really thought that,
we wouldn't be having these conversations.

1:33:33.524 --> 1:33:36.443
No, my dear,
you don't think I’m like any other boy.

1:33:37.361 --> 1:33:38.737
That's why you're afraid.

1:33:39.739 --> 1:33:42.240
If I am, it's for you.

1:33:42.450 --> 1:33:44.993
And I am afraid for you, Miles.

1:33:45.161 --> 1:33:46.870
If you don't tell me now...

1:33:47.038 --> 1:33:48.747
- There's nothing.
- Isn’t there?

1:33:48.914 --> 1:33:52.709
Why did you take my letter?
You did take it, didn't you?

1:33:54.253 --> 1:33:56.087
Yes, I took it.

1:33:56.255 --> 1:33:57.672
Why?

1:33:58.674 --> 1:34:00.759
To see what you said about us.

1:34:00.926 --> 1:34:02.218
Us?

1:34:02.386 --> 1:34:03.762
(Rustling)

1:34:03.929 --> 1:34:05.680
About me.

1:34:06.599 --> 1:34:09.351
- (Rustling)
- And what did you discover?

1:34:09.518 --> 1:34:12.187
You thanked my uncle for trusting you.

1:34:12.355 --> 1:34:14.647
You apologised for troubling him,

1:34:14.815 --> 1:34:16.775
for asking him to come down.

1:34:16.942 --> 1:34:19.069
Go on, Miles, what else did I say?

1:34:19.236 --> 1:34:21.029
That's all I read.

1:34:21.197 --> 1:34:24.032
I heard footsteps. I threw it on the fire.

1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:29.037
And did you take other things?
Is that what you did at school?

1:34:29.205 --> 1:34:31.039
No, I’m not a thief!

1:34:31.248 --> 1:34:32.582
Then, what did you do, Miles?

1:34:32.750 --> 1:34:35.460
I...well, I...

1:34:36.462 --> 1:34:38.546
I said things.

1:34:42.259 --> 1:34:43.927
Yes, Miles?

1:34:47.181 --> 1:34:50.100
Sometimes I hurt things.

1:34:51.143 --> 1:34:53.728
And sometimes at night,

1:34:53.896 --> 1:34:55.980
when everything was dark...

1:34:58.484 --> 1:35:00.068
- What?
- ..they screamed.

1:35:00.236 --> 1:35:02.570
The masters heard about it.

1:35:04.281 --> 1:35:08.284
They said I frightened the other boys.

1:35:12.289 --> 1:35:18.128
And when
did you first see and hear of such things?

1:35:19.505 --> 1:35:21.881
Why, I made them up.

1:35:26.429 --> 1:35:28.221
Who taught them to you?

1:35:28.431 --> 1:35:31.099
I told you, they just came into my head.

1:35:31.267 --> 1:35:33.351
What were they?

1:35:34.311 --> 1:35:36.771
Shall I tell you who taught them to you?

1:35:36.939 --> 1:35:38.398
I won't ever again! I promise!

1:35:38.566 --> 1:35:41.317
Shall I tell you who taught you?
The things you've done and said?

1:35:41.485 --> 1:35:42.819
Shall I tell you his name?

1:35:43.028 --> 1:35:46.614
You don't fool me!
I know why you keep on and on.

1:35:46.782 --> 1:35:50.118
It’s because you're afraid.
You're afraid you might be mad!

1:35:50.327 --> 1:35:53.872
So you keep on and on,
trying to make me admit something that isn't true,

1:35:54.039 --> 1:35:56.374
trying to frighten me
the way you frightened Flora.

1:35:56.584 --> 1:35:58.918
- Miles! Please!
- Well, I’m not Flora! I’m no baby!

1:35:59.086 --> 1:36:01.212
You think you can run to my uncle
with a lot of lies.

1:36:01.422 --> 1:36:04.507
But he won't believe you,
not when I tell him what you are.

1:36:04.675 --> 1:36:09.012
A damned hussy! A damned, dirty-minded hag!
You've never fooled us.

1:36:09.180 --> 1:36:11.806
We always knew. (Laughs)

1:36:13.684 --> 1:36:15.310
(Joins in Miles' laughter)

1:36:40.836 --> 1:36:42.045
Miles?

1:36:42.254 --> 1:36:43.755
Forgive me.

1:36:43.923 --> 1:36:46.174
Hush, darling, hush!

1:36:47.343 --> 1:36:48.676
There.

1:36:48.844 --> 1:36:50.678
I didn't mean it.

1:36:50.846 --> 1:36:52.805
It wasn't you.

1:36:52.973 --> 1:36:54.432
That voice.

1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:56.768
Those words.

1:36:56.936 --> 1:36:58.645
They weren't yours.

1:37:00.606 --> 1:37:02.023
Forgive me.

1:37:02.191 --> 1:37:04.484
Miles, dear Miles...

1:37:04.652 --> 1:37:06.319
Say it now.

1:37:06.487 --> 1:37:08.905
Now, while I’m holding you.

1:37:09.073 --> 1:37:11.491
Say his name.

1:37:11.659 --> 1:37:13.701
And it will all be over.

1:37:13.869 --> 1:37:15.119
Who?

1:37:16.664 --> 1:37:19.165
The man who taught you.

1:37:19.333 --> 1:37:21.376
The man you've been meeting,

1:37:21.544 --> 1:37:23.628
that you've never stopped meeting.

1:37:23.837 --> 1:37:25.421
You're wrong!

1:37:25.589 --> 1:37:28.174
- You're insane! You're insane!
- His name, Miles!

1:37:28.342 --> 1:37:30.885
You are insane! You're insane!

1:37:31.095 --> 1:37:34.222
His name, Miles! Tell me his name!

1:37:34.390 --> 1:37:36.766
- You must tell me his name!
- He's dead!

1:37:39.562 --> 1:37:41.646
- Look! Look!
- No! (Screams)

1:37:42.481 --> 1:37:43.523
Look!

1:37:43.691 --> 1:37:44.816
- No!
- He's here!

1:37:44.984 --> 1:37:47.402
- For the last time, he's here!
- No, he's dead!

1:37:47.570 --> 1:37:50.363
He's here, and you must say his name!

1:37:51.282 --> 1:37:54.659
Quint! Peter Quint! Where? Where?

1:37:55.452 --> 1:37:56.578
Where?

1:37:56.745 --> 1:37:58.705
Where, you devil?

1:37:58.872 --> 1:38:00.123
Where?

1:38:22.146 --> 1:38:24.230
He's gone, Miles.

1:38:25.566 --> 1:38:27.650
You're safe.

1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:31.654
You're free.

1:38:33.699 --> 1:38:35.783
I have you.

1:38:36.952 --> 1:38:39.037
He's lost you forever.

1:38:43.125 --> 1:38:44.751
Miles?

1:38:53.385 --> 1:38:57.138
Miles!

1:39:01.226 --> 1:39:02.852
(Whimpers)

1:39:06.190 --> 1:39:07.690
(Sobs)
