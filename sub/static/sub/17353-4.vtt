WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:05.104
I AM PLACING THIS RECORDER
IN THE CLOSET.

00:06.191 --> 00:07.138
ADAM?

00:07.173 --> 00:09.041
I'M SORRY.
DID SOMETHING JUST TOUCH YOU?

00:09.076 --> 00:10.908
YES!

00:10.943 --> 00:13.812
MY UNCLE
WAS MURDERED IN HERE.

00:13.813 --> 00:18.684
I SAW A MAN STANDING
RIGHT HERE IN MY ROOM.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.221
IS THERE ANYBODY
DOWN THERE?

00:23.789 --> 00:26.958
MY DAUGHTER HAD
THE HOUSE BLESSED.

00:26.993 --> 00:30.630
BUT I FELT LIKE THERE
WAS SOME EVIL LEFT BEHIND.

00:30.665 --> 00:32.165
MY GOD!

00:36.235 --> 00:38.002
I'M AMY BRUNI.

00:38.037 --> 00:40.438
AND I'M ADAM BERRY.

00:40.473 --> 00:42.506
WE'VE SPENT
A COMBINED 30 YEARS

00:42.541 --> 00:46.144
INVESTIGATING THE WORLD'S
MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS.

00:46.145 --> 00:47.779
AFTER THOUSANDS OF CASES,

00:47.814 --> 00:51.050
WE ARE READY FOR OUR
MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEY YET.

00:52.986 --> 00:57.123
RESCUING FAMILIES TERRORIZED
BY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

00:57.158 --> 01:00.025
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.862
WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND THE HAUNTING

01:02.897 --> 01:05.698
TO HELP FAMILIES
RECLAIM THEIR HOMES...

01:05.733 --> 01:07.217
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:07.252 --> 01:08.666
...AND THEIR LIVES.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.738
CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

01:13.339 --> 01:15.506
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:15.541 --> 01:17.843
<i> So, I'm messaging on behalf
of my mother, Linda.</i>

01:17.878 --> 01:19.844
<i> She lives in Chelsea,
Massachusetts.</i>

01:19.879 --> 01:23.549
<i> And her house
is most definitely haunted.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:24.915
<i> She's the victim
of shadow figures,</i>

01:24.950 --> 01:27.670
<i> and she will never go down
in the basement.</i>

01:27.705 --> 01:30.355
<i> She's lived there
for more than 35 years,</i>

01:30.390 --> 01:33.559
<i> and it's the house where
she raised her five kids.</i>

01:33.594 --> 01:36.729
<i> My Uncle Eric was actually
murdered in the house,</i>

01:36.764 --> 01:38.762
<i> in one of the apartments
downstairs.</i>

01:38.797 --> 01:41.734
<i> We don't know if it's him
or something else in the house.</i>

01:41.769 --> 01:43.601
<i> Please, come check
out the house.</i>

01:43.602 --> 01:44.569
THAT'S A LOT.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.569
I KNOW.
IT'S A LOT.

01:45.604 --> 01:47.471
AND THAT'S
JUST THE BEGINNING.

01:47.506 --> 01:50.442
THIS CASE, ALMOST MORE THAN
ANY OTHER CASE WE'VE DONE,

01:50.477 --> 01:52.211
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE HAVE
A LOT RIDING ON IT.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.277
WOW.

01:53.312 --> 01:54.646
THE BROTHER'S MURDERED
IN THE BASEMENT?

01:54.647 --> 01:55.897
YEAH, THE BROTHER.

01:55.932 --> 01:57.148
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

01:57.149 --> 02:01.320
THE MURDER IN THE BASEMENT
TOOK PLACE IN, I BELIEVE, 1995.

02:01.355 --> 02:04.188
HER BROTHER ERIC,
WHO WAS MENTALLY HANDICAPPED,

02:04.223 --> 02:07.960
HAD THE BRAIN CAPACITY OF
LIKE A 10- OR 12-YEAR-OLD,

02:07.995 --> 02:10.759
WAS MURDERED
BY HIS OWN BROTHER.

02:10.794 --> 02:15.001
SHE'S LIKE, "YOU GUYS ARE KINDA
MY ONLY HOPE AT THIS POINT."

02:19.072 --> 02:21.338
THIS IS GONNA BE A TOUGH CASE.

02:21.373 --> 02:23.875
WE'RE DEALING WITH A HOME
THAT'S HAD PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

02:23.876 --> 02:25.877
FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS,

02:25.912 --> 02:28.314
SOME OF WHICH MAY BE LINKED
TO A TRAGIC MURDER.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.382
SO THE EMOTIONAL TIES RUN DEEP,

02:30.383 --> 02:32.150
BUT WE'RE GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

02:32.185 --> 02:33.918
TO DETERMINE
WHAT SPIRIT OR SPIRITS

02:33.919 --> 02:35.319
ARE SCARING THE FAMILY

02:35.354 --> 02:38.290
AND HOPEFULLY HELP THEM
OVERCOME THEIR FEARS.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.523
YOUR HOUSE IS GORGEOUS.

02:39.558 --> 02:41.994
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER SANDY.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.094
HI.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.530
SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

02:44.565 --> 02:46.397
UM, SINCE '74.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.550
MY GOODNESS.
SO A WHILE.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.634
I KNOW
YOU GUYS CONTACTED US.

02:50.669 --> 02:54.473
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
HAVE A LOT GOING ON HERE.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.793
A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED

02:56.828 --> 02:59.078
AFTER WE HAD
SOME DEATHS IN THE FAMILY,

02:59.113 --> 03:00.578
EVEN PRIOR TO THAT.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.048
EVEN PRIOR.
YEAH, WHEN WE FIRST --

03:02.083 --> 03:03.448
WHEN I FIRST
BOUGHT THE HOUSE.

03:03.483 --> 03:06.686
SO ACTIVITY HAPPENED
BEFORE YOUR BROTHER PASSED.

03:06.721 --> 03:08.421
IT WAS CONSTANTLY
THINGS HAPPENING.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.689
IT'S GETTING
TO A POINT NOW

03:09.724 --> 03:10.888
IT'S AN EVERYDAY
OCCURRENCE.

03:10.923 --> 03:13.426
SOMETHING HAPPENED
THIS WEEK, TOO.

03:13.461 --> 03:16.761
MY HUSBAND
WOULD SEE SHADOWS

03:16.796 --> 03:19.332
WALKING FROM ONE BEDROOM
TO ANOTHER.

03:20.799 --> 03:23.736
ABOUT THREE, FOUR WEEKS AGO,
I WAS SLEEPING.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.272
SOMETHING WOKE ME UP,
LIKE, SOMETHING

03:26.307 --> 03:27.672
THAT WASN'T NORMAL.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.110
MY HUSBAND
CAME INTO THE BEDROOM

03:31.145 --> 03:34.514
AND SAW SOMEONE
TALL STAND OVER ME

03:34.549 --> 03:37.614
AND TOUCH MY FACE.

03:37.649 --> 03:41.287
SO THAT'S WHEN
I REALLY GOT SCARED.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.520
I JUST NEED TO KNOW

03:42.555 --> 03:45.290
FOR MY OWN PEACE OF MIND
AND FOR MY CHILDREN.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.524
I JUST NEED TO KNOW.

03:47.559 --> 03:49.628
I'M THINKING MAYBE
WE COULD HEAD DOWNSTAIRS.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.697
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
SANDY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.699
YOU DON'T GO
DOWNSTAIRS AT ALL?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.333
NO.

03:58.637 --> 04:01.274
WHEN I'M AT THE TOP
OF THE STAIRS,

04:01.309 --> 04:03.941
I JUST GET THIS STRANGE

04:03.976 --> 04:05.778
ALMOST LIKE
ANXIETY ATTACK.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.077
YEAH.

04:07.112 --> 04:09.214
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING DOWN IN THE BASEMENT?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.548
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

04:10.583 --> 04:11.851
I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE.

04:11.886 --> 04:13.453
JUST DOESN'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

04:13.488 --> 04:15.688
NOT AT ALL.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.826
SEEING YOUR MOM'S
REACTION TO THAT,

04:20.861 --> 04:22.860
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

04:22.895 --> 04:24.496
AFTER MY UNCLE WAS KILLED,
I BEGGED HER

04:24.497 --> 04:26.030
TO SELL THE HOUSE
AND MOVE.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.467
BUT SHE JUST HAD SUCH
A CONNECTION HERE.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.867
AND SHE JUST FELT LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

04:29.902 --> 04:32.003
"I'M NOT GONNA HAVE SOMEBODY
PUSH ME OUT OF MY HOME."

04:32.004 --> 04:33.203
RIGHT, RIGHT.

04:33.238 --> 04:36.476
AND TO SEE HER NOT
WANNA COME DOWN HERE, IT IS SAD.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.410
WHAT HAS HAPPENED
DOWN HERE?

04:39.445 --> 04:41.746
ONE NIGHT, I WAS
SLEEPING ON THIS COUCH.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.150
AND SOMETHING WOKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

04:44.185 --> 04:45.885
AND I LOOKED OVER
IN THAT DIRECTION.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.586
AND I SAW SOMEBODY
STANDING THERE,

04:47.621 --> 04:48.953
LOOKED LIKE AN OUTLINE.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.257
AND I ORIGINALLY HAD THOUGHT,
"MY GOD.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.557
SOMEONE BROKE IN,
AND I CAUGHT THEM.

04:52.592 --> 04:55.693
SOMEONE'S IN THE HOUSE,"
BECAUSE IT WAS THAT CLEAR.

04:55.694 --> 04:58.731
SO I DOVE OVER THE COUCH.
AND I HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH HERE.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.501
AND THE LIGHTS CAME ON,
AND NOBODY WAS THERE.

05:01.536 --> 05:02.499
MY GOODNESS.

05:02.534 --> 05:04.236
YEAH, SO THAT WAS
A LITTLE WEIRD.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.569
SO THIS IS
THE FAMILY ROOM.

05:05.604 --> 05:07.072
AND THERE'S ANOTHER
APARTMENT THIS WAY?

05:07.107 --> 05:09.575
- CORRECT.
- OKAY.

05:11.677 --> 05:13.245
A LITTLE BACK STORY
ON THIS APARTMENT,

05:13.280 --> 05:15.079
MY UNCLE LIVED HERE.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.282
MY UNCLE WAS BORN WITH
CEREBRAL PALSY AND EPILEPSY.

05:18.283 --> 05:21.336
AND HE ALSO
LOST OXYGEN AT BIRTH,

05:21.371 --> 05:23.781
SO HE WAS
DEVELOPMENTALLY BEHIND.

05:23.816 --> 05:25.955
HE WAS 33.
BUT HE ALMOST WAS,

05:25.990 --> 05:28.094
LIKE, THE AGE
OF A 12-YEAR-OLD.

05:28.129 --> 05:29.927
HIS NAME WAS ERIC.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.196
AND HE WAS MURDERED
IN HERE.

05:32.231 --> 05:35.334
ACTUALLY, RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF THE DOOR

05:35.369 --> 05:37.202
WAS WHERE HIS BODY
WAS LEFT.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.371
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:40.406 --> 05:43.109
THERE WAS A DISAGREEMENT
WITH HIS BROTHER,

05:43.144 --> 05:45.796
MY OTHER UNCLE,
WHO HAD DRUG ISSUES.

05:45.831 --> 05:48.424
HE WAS BREAKING
INTO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE,

05:48.459 --> 05:50.982
AND THERE WAS A FIGHT,
AND HE KILLED HIM.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.787
SO SINCE THEN, I GUESS,
WHAT ACTIVITY HAS HAPPENED?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.086
MY DAUGHTER
LIVED DOWN HERE

05:56.121 --> 05:58.091
WITH HER DAUGHTER,
ARIANNA, MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

05:58.126 --> 06:00.024
AND THERE WERE ALWAYS
THINGS HAPPENING.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.128
LIKE, SHE WOULD ALWAYS STAND
AT THE EDGE OF HER CRIB,

06:02.163 --> 06:04.163
FACING THIS WAY
AND LOOK RIGHT AT THE CLOSET.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.499
AND SHE SAW A SHADOW.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.499
WEIRD.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.153
SHE CLEARLY REMEMBERS
IT TO THIS DAY.

06:11.188 --> 06:13.737
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED
TO WORRY A LITTLE.

06:13.772 --> 06:16.174
AND THEY ENDED UP
MOVING BACK HOME WITH ME, SO...

06:16.209 --> 06:17.107
- YEAH.
- RIGHT.

06:17.142 --> 06:18.409
IS THAT WHY
THEY MOVED BACK?

06:18.444 --> 06:21.080
YEAH, SHE WAS JUST --
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE, ENOUGH.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.383
AND SHE WAS JUST
LIKE, BOOM, HOME.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.618
AFTER TALKING WITH SANDY,
IT SOUNDED LIKE

06:27.653 --> 06:31.057
A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
HAD EXPERIENCES IN THE BASEMENT.

06:31.092 --> 06:32.991
SO I WANT TO SIT DOWN
WITH HER DAUGHTERS,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.725
ADISON AND HADLEY,
AND FIND OUT

06:34.760 --> 06:36.729
IF THEY'VE EVER HAD
ANY EXPERIENCES THERE.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.466
THANK YOU FOR SITTING
WITH ME FOR A LITTLE BIT.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.603
SO, AS CHILDREN,
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME

06:43.638 --> 06:46.670
YOU EACH HAD AN EXPERIENCE
IN THE HOUSE?

06:46.705 --> 06:50.542
ONE TIME, I WAS DOWN HERE,
AND MY GRANDMOTHER SENT ME

06:50.577 --> 06:52.477
DOWN TO THE OTHER FRIDGE
OVER THERE

06:52.478 --> 06:54.613
JUST TO GET SOMETHING SIMPLE,
WHATEVER WE NEEDED,

06:54.648 --> 06:55.946
MILK OR WHATEVER IT WAS.

06:55.981 --> 06:57.147
THE WAY
THAT THE STAIRS ARE,

06:57.182 --> 06:59.184
YOU CAN SEE DOWN HERE
UNTIL THE LAST SECOND.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.287
ONE TIME, I HAPPENED
TO LOOK TO THE RIGHT,

07:01.322 --> 07:03.320
LOOKED BACK TO THE LEFT,
AND I CAN DESCRIBE

07:03.355 --> 07:07.093
TO YOU COMPLETELY A SIDE PROFILE
OF A MAN WALKING.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.196
AND I REMEMBER
THE WAY HE WALKED WAS

07:12.197 --> 07:14.733
JUST SUBTLE AND LIKE HE DIDN'T
HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.634
JUST WALKED
RIGHT DOWN HERE.

07:16.669 --> 07:19.570
I WATCHED THE ENTIRE THING
FOR PROBABLY LIKE FOUR SECONDS,

07:19.571 --> 07:20.939
AND THEN I SPRINTED
UP THE STAIRS

07:20.974 --> 07:22.508
TO MY GRANDMOTHER CRYING.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.741
SO, HOW ABOUT YOU?

07:23.742 --> 07:25.311
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST PARANORMAL
EXPERIENCE IN THE HOUSE?

07:25.346 --> 07:28.579
SO, I NEVER HAD
ANYTHING AS VIVID AS THAT.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.949
A LOT OF IT WAS SILHOUETTES,
WHICH WE'VE ALL SAID

07:30.984 --> 07:33.284
THAT WE'VE SEEN A FEW
OF THOSE HERE AND THERE.

07:33.285 --> 07:36.320
AND IT'S BEEN DOWN HERE,
NEVER --

07:36.355 --> 07:37.857
YOU NEVER WANT TO COME
IN THE BASEMENT ALONE.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.190
IT WAS ALWAYS A KNOWN THING.

07:39.225 --> 07:43.295
AND IT SOUNDS SO SILLY,
BUT YOU COULD REALLY JUST FEEL

07:43.330 --> 07:45.296
THAT I WAS NOT
THE ONLY ONE HERE.

07:45.331 --> 07:48.667
WHAT WOULD BE
THE BEST OUTCOME FOR YOU GUYS

07:48.702 --> 07:50.667
AFTER WE'RE DONE
WITH ALL OF THIS?

07:50.702 --> 07:53.922
I WANT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US
TO HAPPEN.

07:53.957 --> 07:57.143
I WANT, LIKE, SOMEONE
OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY

07:57.178 --> 07:58.945
TO WITNESS
WHAT WE WITNESS.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.364
- RIGHT.
- YEAH, SOME VALIDATION

08:01.399 --> 08:03.748
WOULD DEFINITELY
BE HELPFUL.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.151
I MEAN, THE MAIN GOAL IS
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EVERYONE

08:06.186 --> 08:07.587
THAT LIVES HERE
AND HAS BEEN HERE

08:07.622 --> 08:08.953
TO BE COMFORTABLE
IN THIS BASEMENT,

08:08.988 --> 08:11.657
NOT, YOU KNOW, HAVE
TO RUN IN AND RUN OUT.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.657
RIGHT.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.198
THIS CASE CARRIES MORE
EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE THAN MOST,

08:20.233 --> 08:23.635
SO WE'RE GONNA DO WHATEVER WE
CAN TO FIND ANSWERS FOR LINDA.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.054
THESE CAMERAS
ARE JUST ONE TOOL

08:25.089 --> 08:27.398
FOR MAKING CONTACT
WITH THE SPIRITS

08:27.433 --> 08:29.707
AND FIGURING OUT
WHO IS ACTUALLY HERE.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.676
ADAM?

08:32.711 --> 08:33.645
I HEARD FOOTSTEPS.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.778
YOU DID?
OVER HERE?

08:34.813 --> 08:36.947
I HEARD LIKE TWO FOOTSTEPS,
LIKE, BOOM, BOOM.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.517
IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE COMING
FROM THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.

08:39.518 --> 08:41.486
SOMETHING IS TRYING
TO REACH OUT TO US ALREADY,

08:41.522 --> 08:43.456
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN
BEGUN TO INVESTIGATE.

08:43.491 --> 08:45.323
WE SHOULD FINISH
SETTING UP QUICKLY.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.724
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE,

08:46.759 --> 08:49.428
THEY ARE GOING TO START
INTERACTING WITH US NOW.

08:49.463 --> 08:50.396
THEY'RE NOT GONNA WAIT.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.071
SO WE'RE GONNA START
WITH THE LIVING ROOM,

08:59.106 --> 09:00.404
FACING DOWN THE HALLWAY

09:00.439 --> 09:03.242
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY SAW
THE SHADOW FIGURES

09:03.277 --> 09:05.978
AND WHERE I HEARD
THE FOOTSTEPS.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.778
SO WHAT CAN WE...

09:07.813 --> 09:09.915
I MEAN, IF WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SHADOW FIGURES,

09:09.950 --> 09:11.181
WE'LL PUT
THE REM PODS DOWN.

09:11.216 --> 09:14.169
AND SOMETHING WALKS THROUGH,
IT WOULD GO OFF.

09:14.204 --> 09:17.122
WE USE REM PODS
TO POSSIBLY DETECT

09:17.157 --> 09:18.656
THE PRESENCE OF SPIRITS.

09:18.657 --> 09:19.958
LET'S PUT IT RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THE DOOR

09:19.993 --> 09:21.759
WHERE THEY SEE
THE SHADOWS.

09:21.794 --> 09:25.096
THEY PICK UP ON
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, OR EMF.

09:25.131 --> 09:26.530
PARANORMAL RESEARCHERS

09:26.565 --> 09:29.635
BELIEVE THAT SUDDEN
UNEXPLAINABLE CHANGES IN EMF

09:29.670 --> 09:31.337
COULD BE THE SIGN OF GHOSTS.

09:35.007 --> 09:35.973
ARE YOU READY?

09:35.974 --> 09:37.109
YEAH, I'M READY.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.582
WHEREVER YOU ARE IN THE HOUSE,
CAN YOU MAKE A NOISE

09:43.617 --> 09:45.785
SO WE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

09:48.254 --> 09:51.123
IF YOU WALK BY THOSE THINGS
ON THE GROUND,

09:51.158 --> 09:54.491
THEY MIGHT GO OFF.

09:54.526 --> 09:57.512
CAN YOU WALK TOWARD US,
PLEASE?

09:57.547 --> 10:00.498
IS THERE ANYBODY
DOWN THERE?

10:02.467 --> 10:04.270
ARE YOU ERIC?

10:06.000 --> 10:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:27.159 --> 10:30.029
IF YOU WALK BY THOSE THINGS
ON THE GROUND,

10:30.064 --> 10:32.198
THEY MIGHT GO OFF.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.335
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:43.043 --> 10:44.107
IS THAT YOU?

10:44.142 --> 10:47.963
IS THAT YOU TRYING
TO GET OUR ATTENTION?

10:47.998 --> 10:51.784
CAN YOU MAKE A NOISE
SO WE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

10:51.819 --> 10:55.920
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
A KNOCK.

10:55.921 --> 10:58.256
IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS
EITHER IN THE KITCHEN

10:58.291 --> 11:00.157
OR THE BACK BEDROOM.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.127
I THINK IT WAS COMING
FROM, LIKE, HERE.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.260
WASN'T IT?

11:03.295 --> 11:06.298
YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE FURTHER
DOWN TO THE LEFT.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.298
THIS SIDE?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.867
YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

11:09.868 --> 11:12.803
DO IT AGAIN.

11:12.838 --> 11:17.776
CAN YOU MAKE A NOISE
SO WE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

11:20.946 --> 11:22.913
SO QUIET!

11:22.948 --> 11:24.449
LITTLE TINY KNOCK.
I DON'T --

11:24.450 --> 11:25.416
YEAH.

11:25.451 --> 11:26.784
IF THERE WERE MORE...

11:26.819 --> 11:28.971
MAYBE THEN IT WOULD'VE
BEEN SOMETHING.

11:29.006 --> 11:31.123
WE GOT ONE EMF SPIKE
AND ONE KNOCK

11:31.158 --> 11:32.789
SINCE WE'VE BEEN UPSTAIRS.

11:32.824 --> 11:34.593
AND ALTHOUGH THEY'RE BOTH
PROMISING SIGNS,

11:34.628 --> 11:36.326
EACH WAS SO BRIEF
THAT I'M NOT SURE

11:36.361 --> 11:40.564
WHATEVER'S HERE IS WILLING
TO COMMUNICATE WITH US.

11:40.599 --> 11:43.602
DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.502
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD
CHANGE OUR APPROACH

11:45.503 --> 11:46.872
AND HEAD DOWNSTAIRS.

11:52.644 --> 11:53.813
OKAY.

11:55.814 --> 11:58.048
HEY, ERIC.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.218
IF YOU'RE HERE,
MY NAME IS ADAM.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.354
HI. I'M AMY.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.593
YOUR FAMILY INVITED US HERE
TO TRY TO TALK TO YOU.

12:07.628 --> 12:09.994
I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE
A LITTLE SCARED RIGHT NOW

12:10.029 --> 12:15.367
BECAUSE MAYBE NO ONE'S
REALLY TALKED TO YOU LIKE THIS.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.303
BUT IT'S HARD FOR US
TO SEE YOU.

12:17.338 --> 12:19.170
IT'S HARD FOR US
TO HEAR YOU.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.490
BUT WE HAVE THIS DEVICE HERE
IN HER HAND

12:21.525 --> 12:23.434
THAT IF YOU TALK LOUD
ENOUGH INTO IT,

12:23.469 --> 12:25.343
WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO HEAR YOU,

12:25.344 --> 12:27.713
AND THEY'RE NOT
GONNA HURT YOU.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.216
SO, ERIC, ARE YOU HERE?

12:33.085 --> 12:35.120
I KEEP SEEING THINGS
OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYES.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.052
WHAT?

12:36.087 --> 12:37.121
I DON'T KNOW.

12:37.156 --> 12:38.857
I JUST KEEP SEEING
WEIRD MOVEMENT OUT

12:38.892 --> 12:40.925
OF THE CORNER OF MY EYES.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.461
WE'RE GONNA TRY
TO LISTEN TO THIS, OKAY?

12:42.496 --> 12:43.662
WE'LL SEE
IF WE'RE HEARING YA.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.882
QUIET.

13:04.883 --> 13:07.051
WE MAY NEED TO CHANGE
OUR APPROACH.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.220
I THINK I'LL PUT THIS
IN HIS ROOM

13:09.221 --> 13:11.373
JUST BECAUSE THEN
IT'S FURTHER AWAY FROM US

13:11.408 --> 13:13.525
AND WAY LESS THREATENING
THAN HAVING US,

13:13.560 --> 13:15.259
LIKE, MAKE HIM APPROACH US.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.827
I'M GONNA FILM IT
WITH A FULL-SPECTRUM CAMERA.

13:16.862 --> 13:21.699
AND MAYBE IT'LL PICK UP
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.033
ALL RIGHT, ERIC.

13:23.068 --> 13:26.338
SO NOW YOU'RE IN THERE
IN YOUR SAFE PLACE.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.240
SO CAN YOU LET US
KNOW YOU'RE THERE?

13:28.275 --> 13:31.276
CAN YOU KNOCK FOR ME
LIKE THIS?

13:37.482 --> 13:40.151
IS THAT NOISE COMING
FROM THE BEDROOM?

13:40.186 --> 13:42.820
THAT SOUND
IS THE FULL-SPECTRUM...

13:42.821 --> 13:44.957
TRYING TO FOCUS
ON SOMETHING?

13:47.526 --> 13:49.127
WANT TO GO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE CAMERA?

13:49.128 --> 13:50.229
YEAH.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.366
THAT'S WEIRD.

13:56.401 --> 13:57.969
LET ME JUST
SEE WHY THIS...

13:58.004 --> 13:59.538
YEAH, WHAT IT
WAS FOCUSING ON.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.740
YEAH.

14:06.845 --> 14:10.180
I DON'T KNOW.

14:10.215 --> 14:12.382
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
IN THIS VIDEO.

14:12.417 --> 14:15.220
SO EITHER THE CAMERA
IS PICKING UP ON SOMETHING

14:15.255 --> 14:16.420
THAT WE CAN'T SEE,

14:16.455 --> 14:18.856
OR SOMETHING
IS TOUCHING THE CAMERA.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.992
AND WE GOT NOTHING
ON THE RECORDER, EITHER.

14:20.993 --> 14:24.062
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
GET HIM TO TRUST US.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.028
YEAH.

14:25.063 --> 14:26.230
ALL RIGHT.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.517
I FEEL LIKE WE NEED
TO SHIFT FOCUS.

14:28.552 --> 14:30.769
WHAT IF WE WANT
TO THE TABLE IN THERE

14:30.804 --> 14:32.237
AND JUST KIND OF
GAVE HIM SPACE?

14:32.272 --> 14:33.204
YEAH.

14:39.210 --> 14:40.443
IT WAS SO QUIET.

14:40.478 --> 14:42.046
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S HIM.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.282
I DON'T KNOW THAT
HE'S READY TO TALK TO US.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.801
YOU KNOW, I FEEL
LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE

14:45.836 --> 14:47.762
SOME TRUST ISSUES
AT THIS POINT.

14:47.797 --> 14:49.653
I'M THINKING
THAT THIS IS A CASE

14:49.688 --> 14:52.958
THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED
TO HAVE THE FAMILY COME IN.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.829
I'VE CALLED IN
MY FRIEND CHRISTINE,

14:58.830 --> 15:00.866
WHO IS ANOTHER
PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.068
SHE DESIGNED
THIS HOLOGRAM DEVICE

15:03.103 --> 15:05.168
THAT CAN PRODUCE 3-D IMAGES.

15:05.203 --> 15:08.240
WE'RE HOPING THAT IT WILL
KIND OF BE A TRIGGER OBJECT,

15:08.275 --> 15:09.940
KIND OF ENTICE ENTITIES OUT

15:09.975 --> 15:12.511
AND HAVE THEM COME
INTERACT WITH US,

15:12.546 --> 15:15.012
WHETHER IT'S ERIC
OR SOMEONE ELSE.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.749
IT'S MADE USING
A REGULAR FLAT-SCREEN TV

15:17.784 --> 15:19.016
AND SOME PLEXIGLAS.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.969
AND AROUND IT
IS A PROXIMITY SENSOR,

15:21.004 --> 15:22.887
SO IF ANYTHING GOES
TOWARD THE HOLOGRAM,

15:22.922 --> 15:26.290
IT WILL SET OFF THE ALARM.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.994
WE'RE ALSO BRING SANDY
INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.262
THANK YOU
FOR COMING OVER.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.461
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
COME ON IN.

15:31.496 --> 15:34.531
SHE'S SOMEONE WHO ERIC
WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH

15:34.532 --> 15:37.702
AND WHO HE WOULD FEEL
COMFORTABLE TALKING TO.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.237
THIS IS THE HOLOGRAM.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.703
AND IT FLIPS THROUGH.

15:40.738 --> 15:43.006
AND SO IT FEELS
LIKE YOU CAN,

15:43.041 --> 15:45.508
LIKE, REACH IN AND TOUCH IT,
YOU KNOW?

15:45.543 --> 15:48.914
OKAY, SO I THINK THAT THE BEST
THING FOR YOU TO DO

15:48.949 --> 15:51.149
IS TO BASICALLY
JUST KIND OF TALK TO ERIC.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.315
OKAY.

15:52.350 --> 15:56.221
LET HIM KNOW WHO WE ARE
AND THAT WE'RE SAFE.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.590
UM, ERIC,
IT'S ME, SANDY.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.927
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
AMY AND ADAM.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.194
THEY'RE VERY NICE.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.262
HI.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.163
AND THEY'RE HERE
TO HELP YOU TALK TO US.

16:06.198 --> 16:10.935
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME, MOM,

16:10.970 --> 16:12.905
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE
THAT WILL HELP US DO THAT.

16:12.940 --> 16:16.574
SO IT'S TOTALLY OKAY
TO TALK TO THEM.

16:20.078 --> 16:22.514
ERIC, ARE YOU HERE
WITH US?

16:27.419 --> 16:28.821
DO YOU LIKE THE HOLOGRAM
RIGHT HERE?

16:28.856 --> 16:30.454
IT'S A DINOSAUR.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.291
THAT'S PRETTY COOL,
RIGHT?

16:34.693 --> 16:38.530
YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT YOUR HAND
IN HERE LIKE THIS.

16:38.565 --> 16:42.966
I'M GRABBING THE DINOSAUR.

16:43.001 --> 16:46.438
SO IF YOU'RE HERE,
CAN YOU LET US KNOW SOMEHOW?

16:46.473 --> 16:49.241
JUST TOUCH THE HOLOGRAM
OR SAY SOMETHING.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.814
WAS THAT YOU THAT USED
TO PLAY WITH ARIANNA,

16:55.849 --> 16:57.949
WHEN SHE WAS DOWN HERE
IN YOUR ROOM?

17:00.419 --> 17:02.053
DO YOU WANT TO LISTEN
TO THIS?

17:02.088 --> 17:03.922
YEAH,
LET'S LISTEN TO IT.

17:20.171 --> 17:21.874
WAIT.
WHAT IS THAT?

17:27.246 --> 17:28.746
IS THAT
WHAT WAS THAT WAS?

17:28.781 --> 17:29.715
YEAH, LISTEN.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.320
MY --

17:35.355 --> 17:37.054
CLEAR AS DAY.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.824
"WE HAVE TO TOUCH IT."

17:55.207 --> 17:57.008
- "WE HAVE TO TOUCH IT."
- "WE HAVE TO TOUCH IT."

17:57.043 --> 17:58.810
- "WE HAVE TO TOUCH IT."
- "WE HAVE TO TOUCH IT."

17:58.845 --> 18:02.246
IT'S LIKE THERE'S
MORE THAN ONE.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.499
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S KEEP TALKING, OKAY?

18:04.534 --> 18:06.752
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE TALKING TO US.

18:09.554 --> 18:11.156
YOU SAID,
"WE NEED TO TOUCH IT."

18:11.191 --> 18:13.192
SO HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HERE?

18:15.460 --> 18:17.663
CAN YOU KNOCK
ON SOMETHING?

18:21.232 --> 18:22.366
LET'S LISTEN.

18:22.401 --> 18:23.869
<i> SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE TALKING TO US.</i>

18:33.212 --> 18:34.879
QUIET.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.413
UM, UNFORTUNATELY,

18:36.448 --> 18:39.217
WHOEVER THIS IS HAS STOPPED
COMMUNICATING WITH US.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.618
ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT TO GO UP
IN THE UPSTAIRS?

18:40.653 --> 18:41.919
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
- LET'S DO SOME THAT.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.456
NOW THAT WE KNOW THERE
ARE MULTIPLE ENTITIES HERE,

18:44.491 --> 18:46.022
WE'LL HAVE TO CAST A WIDER NET

18:46.057 --> 18:49.161
TO FIND OUT WHICH SPIRITS
WE'RE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.932
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
GOING ON DOWNSTAIRS.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.501
IT'S SAYING,
"WE NEED TO TOUCH IT."

18:56.536 --> 18:57.700
THAT'S WEIRD!

18:57.735 --> 18:59.370
YEAH. AND THAT MEANS
IT'S MORE THAN ONE PERSON.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.906
AND WHO'S "WE" AND WHY?

19:00.941 --> 19:01.939
YEAH.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.960
STILL, I'M LEANING
TOWARD IT BEING ERIC.

19:04.995 --> 19:07.946
I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING CONCRETE, THOUGH.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.113
I DON'T HAVE ANY --

19:09.114 --> 19:12.150
TO ME, I DON'T FEEL LIKE
WE HAVE ENOUGH TO SAY,

19:12.185 --> 19:13.318
"THIS IS DEFINITELY ERIC."

19:13.353 --> 19:14.283
BUT WHO IS IT?

19:14.318 --> 19:15.752
ERIC COULD BE
ONE OF THE SPIRITS.

19:15.787 --> 19:18.506
BUT THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING ELSE HERE,

19:18.541 --> 19:21.226
EITHER ATTACHED TO THE LAND
OR THE HOUSE.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.458
AND A LOT OF STUFF

19:22.493 --> 19:25.363
WE HAVE GOTTEN
DOESN'T INDICATE

19:25.398 --> 19:28.198
A DEFINITE PERSON
OR AN IDENTITY.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.668
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO DIG
DEEP INTO THE BASEMENT.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.138
I MEAN, SANDY'S DAUGHTER
AND HER GRANDDAUGHTER

19:33.173 --> 19:35.607
BOTH LIVED DOWN THERE
AND HAD EXPERIENCES.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.973
WE SHOULD TALK TO THEM,

19:37.008 --> 19:39.778
SEE IF THEY CAN DESCRIBE
WHAT THIS APPARITION LOOKS LIKE

19:39.813 --> 19:41.077
THAT THEY'VE EACH SEEN.

19:41.112 --> 19:43.913
AND COMPARE IT TO PHOTOGRAPHS,
ASK THE FAMILY,

19:43.948 --> 19:45.717
SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO IT
IS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.586
YEAH.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.224
TODAY I'M GOING TO MEET UP
WITH SANDY'S DAUGHTER

19:52.259 --> 19:54.326
AND GRANDDAUGHTER
TO GET MORE INFORMATION

19:54.361 --> 19:56.361
ON THAT FIGURE IN THE CLOSET.

19:59.397 --> 20:01.332
ALL RIGHT.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.334
SO YOU'RE ARIANNA?
IS THAT RIGHT?

20:03.369 --> 20:05.370
DO YOU GO BY ARI
OR ARIANNA?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.337
YOU CAN CALL ME WHATEVER.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.175
OKAY. NOW, THIS --
WAS THIS YOUR ROOM?

20:10.210 --> 20:11.408
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

20:11.409 --> 20:14.411
AND WHEN YOU WERE
IN THIS ROOM,

20:14.446 --> 20:16.380
DID YOU SEE SOMEBODY
IN YOUR CLOSET?

20:16.381 --> 20:19.685
WELL, UM...

20:20.986 --> 20:26.325
I SAW, LIKE, A MAN STANDING
RIGHT HERE IN MY ROOM.

20:28.926 --> 20:31.661
REALLY?
AND WHAT WAS HE DOING?

20:31.696 --> 20:35.867
HE WAS JUST LOOKING AT ME
LIKE IN A STRANGE AND EVIL WAY.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.087
SO HE WASN'T BEING
SILLY OR ANYTHING?

20:39.122 --> 20:42.238
NO? HE WAS JUST
STANDING STILL LIKE THAT?

20:42.273 --> 20:44.810
SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
HOW'D YOU MAKE HIM GO AWAY?

20:44.845 --> 20:46.610
I TURNED AROUND,
I GOT UP,

20:46.611 --> 20:48.513
AND THEN I SHUT THE DOOR.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.380
AND THEN I WENT
BACK TO BED.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.050
BUT THEN IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT,

20:52.085 --> 20:54.418
IT WAS OPEN AGAIN.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.886
OKAY. AND HOW MANY TIMES
DID THAT HAPPEN?

20:56.921 --> 21:03.328
I SAW HIM LIKE FIVE TIMES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.565
HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS
THAT THIS HAPPENED?

21:07.600 --> 21:08.932
THE FIRST TIME SHE TOLD ME

21:08.967 --> 21:10.466
IT WAS PROBABLY
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO.

21:10.501 --> 21:12.235
OKAY. SO SHE WOULD'VE BEEN 4,
ABOUT THAT TIME?

21:12.236 --> 21:13.536
YES.

21:13.571 --> 21:15.139
WERE YOU SCARED?

21:15.140 --> 21:16.139
A LOT.

21:16.174 --> 21:17.675
YEAH? YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?

21:17.710 --> 21:20.544
YEAH. HE WAS, LIKE,
HAVING --

21:20.579 --> 21:24.081
HAD, LIKE,
A WORK SHIRT ON AND A TIE.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.416
AND HE HAD A HAT.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.452
HE HAD, LIKE, BOOTS ON.

21:29.487 --> 21:32.691
AND THEY, LIKE, HAD,
LIKE, BUTTONS ON IT.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.390
OKAY.

21:34.425 --> 21:37.529
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN PARANORMAL

21:37.564 --> 21:40.282
AND IMAGINATION
WHEN IT COMES TO KIDS.

21:40.317 --> 21:42.966
AND IT'S TOUGH
TO GAUGE IT SOMETIMES.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.137
ARIANNA DESCRIBED
THE FIGURE IN HER CLOSET

21:45.172 --> 21:46.370
WITH SUCH DETAIL

21:46.371 --> 21:47.871
THAT I'M CALLING IN
A SKETCH ARTIST

21:47.906 --> 21:49.907
TO SEE IF WE CAN GET
SOME CONCRETE EVIDENCE

21:49.942 --> 21:51.810
AS TO WHO THIS FIGURE IS.

21:54.046 --> 21:57.416
I REMEMBER THAT
HIS HAIR WAS BROWN.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.386
HE WAS TALL.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.720
LONG PANTS ON.

22:04.755 --> 22:05.922
WHILE I'M DOING THAT,

22:05.957 --> 22:07.357
ADAM'S GOING TO
SIT DOWN WITH LINDA

22:07.392 --> 22:10.962
TO SEE WHAT MORE HE CAN
UNCOVER ABOUT ERIC.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.931
IS THIS, UM,
IS THIS ERIC?

22:12.966 --> 22:14.665
THAT'S ERIC, YEAH.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.333
AND HOW OLD WAS
HE IN THIS PICTURE?

22:16.368 --> 22:21.105
IN THAT PICTURE,
HE WAS, UM, LET ME SEE, 19, 20.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.674
OKAY. AND THEN
HE PASSED AT, UM...

22:23.709 --> 22:25.442
HE WAS 33.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.943
HE WAS VERY PROTECTIVE.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.511
AND THAT'S THE REASON
WHY HE WAS KILLED,

22:28.546 --> 22:32.150
WAS BECAUSE MY OTHER BROTHER
WAS USING A CROWBAR

22:32.185 --> 22:33.583
TO BREAK OPEN THE DOOR.

22:33.618 --> 22:35.552
THERE'S THIS TECHNIQUE
THAT WE USE

22:35.587 --> 22:38.724
WHERE WE TRY TO CAPTURE
ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA.

22:38.759 --> 22:42.258
WE ASK QUESTIONS,
AND WE DON'T HAVE YOU

22:42.293 --> 22:44.328
TO COME DOWNSTAIRS WITH US,
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS --

22:44.363 --> 22:47.565
I'D LOVE TO RECORD
YOU ASKING SOME QUESTIONS.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.664
OKAY.

22:48.699 --> 22:50.701
BECAUSE MAYBE YOUR VOICE,
THEY CAN HEAR IT,

22:50.736 --> 22:52.703
AND THEY'RE GONNA WANT
TO, LIKE, TALK TO US

22:52.738 --> 22:53.737
A LITTLE BIT MORE.
- OKAY.

22:53.772 --> 22:55.872
- I'LL START RECORDING NOW.
- OKAY.

22:55.907 --> 22:59.945
THIS IS ADAM WITH LINDA,
AND, WHOEVER'S LISTENING,

22:59.980 --> 23:01.945
SHE IS GOING TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.817
IF YOU COULD RESPOND,
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.819
ERIC, ARE YOU HERE,
HONEY?

23:07.854 --> 23:09.585
I REALLY MISS YOU.

23:09.620 --> 23:13.556
I MISS OUR TIMES TOGETHER.

23:13.557 --> 23:15.591
WE MISS YOU VERY MUCH,

23:15.626 --> 23:20.281
AND IF YOU COULD GIVE US
ANY SIGN THAT YOU'RE OKAY

23:20.316 --> 23:24.936
AND THAT WE CAN ALL REST KNOWING
THAT YOU'RE FINE.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.705
WE LOVE YOU,
AND WE MISS YOU.

23:31.075 --> 23:32.008
THAT'S GREAT.

23:32.043 --> 23:34.277
IT CAN'T COME
FROM ANYONE BETTER.

23:34.278 --> 23:36.214
IF WE COULD LINK
ALL THE ACTIVITY TO ERIC,

23:36.249 --> 23:38.901
IT WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE
RELIEF FOR LINDA.

23:38.936 --> 23:41.478
BUT WE KNOW THERE'S NOT
JUST ONE ENTITY HERE.

23:41.513 --> 23:44.021
SO WE REALLY NEED
TO IDENTIFY BOTH SPIRITS.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.890
AND HOPEFULLY,
AMY HAS SOME LEADS.

23:46.891 --> 23:48.825
WELL, I HAVE SKETCHES.

23:48.860 --> 23:52.062
THIS IS WHAT ARIANNA SAW
IN HER CLOSET IN HER ROOM.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.298
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

24:02.407 --> 24:04.941
WELL, I HAVE SKETCHES.

24:04.976 --> 24:08.179
THIS IS WHAT ARIANNA SAW
IN HER CLOSET IN HER ROOM.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.682
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

24:10.717 --> 24:12.301
THAT IS NOT ERIC.

24:12.336 --> 24:13.850
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

24:13.885 --> 24:16.686
THIS IS HIM WHEN
HE WAS IN SCHOOL.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.622
THIS DOESN'T FIT
THE DESCRIPTION OF ERIC,

24:18.657 --> 24:19.923
BY ANY STRETCH.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.424
NO. THE GLASSES,
THE HAIR, THE NOSE.

24:21.459 --> 24:24.395
YEAH. SHE SAID HE'S
VERY TALL AND SKINNY.

24:24.430 --> 24:27.664
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THIS IS.

24:27.699 --> 24:29.634
THERE IS ONE DETAIL
SHE TOLD ME, THOUGH,

24:29.669 --> 24:31.169
THAT I FOUND
REALLY INTERESTING.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.302
WHAT?

24:32.337 --> 24:36.458
SHE SAID THE BOOTS HE WORE
HAD BUTTONS ON THE SIDE.

24:36.493 --> 24:40.579
YEAH, AND SHE SAID DISTINCTLY,
LIKE, ON THE SIDE.

24:40.614 --> 24:44.249
SO I DID SOME RESEARCH
INTO, LIKE, FOOTWEAR.

24:44.284 --> 24:46.583
ONLY THING I CAN FIND
THAT MATCHES

24:46.618 --> 24:49.354
ARE BOOTS THAT MEN IN,
LIKE, THE EARLY 1900s.

24:49.389 --> 24:52.090
THERE WERE SOME BOOTS
THAT THEY WOULD'VE WORN

24:52.125 --> 24:53.523
THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT.

24:53.558 --> 24:55.226
I MEAN, AND THAT'S NOT
SOMETHING SHE WOULD'VE KNOWN,

24:55.261 --> 24:56.592
BEING 7.

24:56.627 --> 24:58.495
SO I'M GONNA LOOK INTO IT
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

24:58.496 --> 25:02.033
BUT THAT MIGHT GIVE US A CLUE
AS TO WHO MIGHT BE HERE.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.836
TODAY I'M HEADED
TO THE TOWN ARCHIVES

25:06.871 --> 25:09.407
TO SEE WHAT I CAN UNCOVER
ABOUT OUR MYSTERIOUS FIGURE

25:09.442 --> 25:10.806
IN THE BASEMENT CLOSET.

25:10.841 --> 25:12.543
SINCE MOST SPIRITS WE ENCOUNTER

25:12.578 --> 25:14.210
ARE VICTIMS OF A TRAGIC FATE,

25:14.245 --> 25:15.912
AND OUR SUSPECT APPEARS
TO HAVE LIVED

25:15.913 --> 25:17.547
IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY,

25:17.582 --> 25:19.183
I'M GOING TO USE
THAT INFORMATION TO SEE

25:19.218 --> 25:21.620
IF I CAN IDENTIFY WHO HE WAS.

25:25.957 --> 25:26.891
I FOUND SOMETHING.

25:27.925 --> 25:30.061
IN 1908,
THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED

25:30.096 --> 25:31.562
THE GREAT FIRE OF CHELSEA.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.263
AND IT WAS HUGE.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.265
I MEAN, I THINK
THERE WAS SOMETHING

25:34.300 --> 25:36.200
LIKE 85 PEOPLE
PRESUMED DEAD.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.901
GOD!

25:37.936 --> 25:39.402
REALLY BIG.

25:39.437 --> 25:41.907
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
LIKE, ON A MAP,

25:41.942 --> 25:43.707
WHERE THAT HAPPENED
IN RELATION TO HERE.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.042
LIKE, THIS IS
THE BURNT AREA.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.362
IT'S LIKE A FIVE-MINUTE
DRIVE FROM HERE.

25:48.397 --> 25:50.556
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE NO NAMES

25:50.591 --> 25:52.716
OR PICTURES
OF ANY OF THE VICTIMS.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.253
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE,
YOU KNOW, THE PERSON

25:55.288 --> 25:56.852
THAT'S ON THAT SKETCH FITS

25:56.887 --> 25:59.624
THAT TIME PERIOD
OF THE FIRE OF CHELSEA.

26:01.192 --> 26:06.998
AND ALSO, I WAS ABLE TO DIG UP
SOME DETAILS OF ERIC'S MURDER.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.385
IT WAS BRUTAL.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.369
REALLY BRUTAL.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.739
"HE STRANGLED ERIC
WITH A PHONE CORD

26:14.774 --> 26:17.074
AND INFLICTED
30 SEPARATE PUNCTURE

26:17.075 --> 26:19.242
AND BLUNT-FORCE WOUNDS.

26:19.277 --> 26:21.245
NEAR ERIC'S BODY,
POLICE FOUND KNIVES,

26:21.280 --> 26:24.246
A HAMMER,
AND A BROKEN FILE."

26:24.281 --> 26:28.653
THOSE WERE ALL THE THINGS
THAT HE USED TO STAB HIM.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.787
"THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS
STRANGULATION

26:30.822 --> 26:35.260
IN THE SETTING OF MULTIPLE BLUNT
AND PENETRATING INJURIES.

26:35.295 --> 26:38.463
ERIC CAUGHT HIM RANSACKING
THE FAMILY RESIDENCE,

26:38.498 --> 26:41.631
TOLD HIM, 'STOP IT.
I WILL CALL THE POLICE.'"

26:41.632 --> 26:44.300
THAT IS REALLY DISTURBING
TO READ.

26:44.335 --> 26:45.936
"AFTER BEATING HIS BROTHER
WITH A HAMMER,

26:45.971 --> 26:47.004
STABBING HIM WITH A KNIFE,

26:47.005 --> 26:49.240
AND STRANGLING HIM
WITH A PHONE CORD,

26:49.275 --> 26:51.359
CARL LEFT THE HOUSE
WITH A DUFFEL BAG

26:51.394 --> 26:53.603
OF STOLEN ITEMS
AND HIS BLOODY CLOTHES

26:53.638 --> 26:55.812
AND WENT TO A BAR
TO CONTINUE DRINKING

26:55.813 --> 26:57.915
AND LOOKING
TO BUY MORE DRUGS."

26:57.950 --> 26:59.551
GOD.

26:59.586 --> 27:01.117
SO CRAZY.

27:02.353 --> 27:04.353
LOGICALLY, ONE WOULD THINK

27:04.388 --> 27:07.257
THAT ERIC WOULD BE
THE PERSON IN THE BASEMENT.

27:07.258 --> 27:09.310
BUT IN THE PAST,
WE'VE ENCOUNTERED HAUNTINGS

27:09.345 --> 27:11.363
WHERE NEARBY TRAGEDIES,
LIKE THE CHELSEA FIRE,

27:11.398 --> 27:13.398
HAVE LED TO TRAPPED SPIRITS.

27:20.638 --> 27:23.707
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE ENTITY IN THE HOUSE.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.642
AND NOTHING THAT WE'VE GOTTEN

27:25.677 --> 27:28.277
SAYS TO ME CONCRETELY
THAT IT'S ERIC.

27:28.312 --> 27:30.514
OUR GOAL TONIGHT
IS TO FIND SOLID EVIDENCE

27:30.549 --> 27:32.315
OF WHO EITHER ENTITY IS.

27:32.316 --> 27:34.134
GET THAT RECORDER OUT,

27:34.169 --> 27:35.953
AND LET'S TRY
THE LINDA QUESTION.

27:35.988 --> 27:36.921
YES.

27:38.389 --> 27:40.824
<i> ERIC,
ARE YOU HERE, HONEY?</i>

27:44.194 --> 27:45.862
<i> I REALLY MISS YOU.</i>

27:45.897 --> 27:48.497
<i> I MISS OUR TIMES TOGETHER.</i>

27:48.532 --> 27:51.369
<i> WE MISS YOU VERY MUCH,
AND IF YOU COULD GIVE US</i>

27:51.404 --> 27:54.004
<i> ANY SIGN THAT YOU'RE OKAY</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:58.643
<i> AND THAT WE CAN ALL REST
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE FINE.</i>

27:58.678 --> 28:00.945
<i> WE LOVE YOU,
AND WE MISS YOU.</i>

28:04.382 --> 28:07.619
CAN YOU JUST TELL US
THAT YOU'RE OKAY?

28:11.655 --> 28:13.390
LINDA WON'T COME DOWN HERE

28:13.425 --> 28:17.860
BECAUSE SHE FEELS
VERY UNEASY DOWN HERE.

28:17.895 --> 28:21.932
AND IF YOU'RE DOWN HERE,
SHE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT,

28:21.967 --> 28:25.970
EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST VISITING
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

28:26.005 --> 28:29.307
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO TELL US?

28:33.511 --> 28:36.114
LET'S LISTEN.
IT'S GETTING LONG.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.051
<i> ERIC,
ARE YOU HERE, HONEY?</i>

28:44.488 --> 28:45.689
IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.856
<i> I REALLY MISS YOU.</i>

28:46.891 --> 28:48.359
<i> I MISS OUR TIMES TOGETHER.</i>

28:48.394 --> 28:49.792
<i> WE MISS YOU VERY MUCH,</i>

28:49.827 --> 28:53.164
<i> AND IF YOU COULD GIVE US
ANY SIGN THAT YOU'RE OKAY</i>

28:53.199 --> 28:56.501
<i> AND THAT WE CAN ALL REST
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE FINE.</i>

28:56.536 --> 28:58.302
<i> WE LOVE YOU,
AND WE MISS YOU.</i>

28:59.570 --> 29:02.873
<i> CAN YOU JUST TELL US
THAT YOU'RE OKAY?</i>

29:02.908 --> 29:04.307
<i> LINDA WON'T COME DOWN HERE</i>

29:04.342 --> 29:08.043
<i> BECAUSE SHE FEELS
VERY UNEASY DOWN HERE.</i>

29:08.078 --> 29:11.031
<i> AND IF YOU'RE DOWN HERE,
SHE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT,</i>

29:11.066 --> 29:13.984
<i> EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST VISITING
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.</i>

29:14.019 --> 29:16.955
<i> IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO TELL US?</i>

29:21.058 --> 29:23.827
IF WE DON'T GET ANYTHING
FROM THE FAMILY --

29:23.862 --> 29:26.597
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH
THAT THIS IS JUST

29:26.632 --> 29:28.731
ONE MORE THING
SHE'S TRYING.

29:28.766 --> 29:31.769
AND ALL WE CAN DO IS DO
OUR BEST.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.772
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO.
- I KNOW.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.005
- OKAY.
- HE LOVED TO PLAY

29:36.006 --> 29:38.009
WITH HIS MATCHBOX CARS,
AND HE WOULD PUT THEM IN LINE.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.562
AND HE ONLY COULD
COUNT IN DOLLARS.

29:40.597 --> 29:43.080
SO WHAT I'LL DO IS
I'LL SET THE CARS UP

29:43.115 --> 29:44.814
BUT LEAVE ONE ASKEW.

29:44.849 --> 29:47.452
AND THEN I'LL PUT THE DOLLARS UP
AND DO KIND OF THE SAME THING,

29:47.487 --> 29:48.485
LEAVE A COUPLE UP.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.254
AND THEN HOPEFULLY,
THAT'LL COAX HIM

29:50.289 --> 29:51.754
INTO PLAYING AROUND
WITH THEM,

29:51.755 --> 29:54.141
TRYING TO SET THEM RIGHT.

29:54.176 --> 29:56.492
ERIC, THESE ARE SOME --

29:56.527 --> 29:58.262
WE GOT YOU SOME CARS
TO PLAY WITH.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.830
THESE ARE JUST
FOR YOU, OKAY?

30:00.865 --> 30:02.800
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO
WHAT YOU WANT WITH THEM.

30:02.835 --> 30:06.636
I ALSO BROUGHT YOU
SOME DOLLARS

30:06.671 --> 30:09.256
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU LIKE
TO COUNT DOLLARS.

30:09.291 --> 30:11.842
I KNOW, YOU MIGHT BE
SCARED RIGHT NOW.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.109
MAYBE YOU'RE HIDING.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.780
BUT THERE'S NOBODY HERE
THAT WANTS TO DO YOU HARM.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.682
OKAY?

30:19.317 --> 30:22.187
WAS THERE EVER A FIRE
NEAR HERE?

30:24.822 --> 30:28.024
DID YOU GET HURT
IN A FIRE?

30:28.059 --> 30:31.662
THE YELLOW CAR THERE
IS A LITTLE OUT OF PLACE.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.730
IT'S NOT IN LINE.

30:33.765 --> 30:36.100
DO YOU WANT TO FIX IT
FOR US?

30:41.105 --> 30:42.773
DID YOU HEAR
THAT UPSTAIRS?

30:42.808 --> 30:44.074
IT WAS DEFINITELY A...

30:44.075 --> 30:46.544
LIKE A FOOTSTEP
GOING ON RIGHT HERE?

30:46.579 --> 30:48.279
WE HAVE TO GO
CHECK THAT OUT.

30:50.648 --> 30:53.149
SO THE FOOTSTEPS
WERE COMING FROM...

30:53.150 --> 30:55.419
DOWN AT THAT END,
FOR SURE.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.689
LET ME JUST GO
TAKE A PEEK.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.261
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

31:05.296 --> 31:10.167
I MEAN, NOBODY'S --
NOBODY'S DOWN HERE MOVING.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.370
NO.

31:16.407 --> 31:18.641
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS.

31:18.642 --> 31:21.312
LET'S GO CHECK OUT THE RECORDER
AND SEE IF WE GOT ANY EVPs

31:21.347 --> 31:23.880
WHILE WE WERE UP HERE.

31:23.881 --> 31:24.847
OKAY.

31:24.882 --> 31:26.184
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.

31:29.386 --> 31:31.356
COME ON, PLEASE.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.272
LET'S BE CLEAR.
NO ONE WAS IN HERE.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.241
NO!

31:54.912 --> 31:55.945
YOU HEARD THAT, RIGHT?

31:55.980 --> 31:56.979
YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

31:56.980 --> 31:59.583
MY GOD!
MY GOD!

32:08.793 --> 32:09.892
OKAY.

32:09.927 --> 32:11.763
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.534
YOU HEARD THAT, RIGHT?

32:17.535 --> 32:18.469
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.802
MY GOD!

32:19.837 --> 32:22.440
LOOK AT THE HAIRS
ON MY ARMS.

32:22.475 --> 32:24.172
MY GOD.

32:24.207 --> 32:25.710
DON'T LOSE THE SPACE.

32:30.815 --> 32:33.050
LIKE, IT'S MAKING --
JUST MAKING SOUNDS.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.069
"PA-DAH, PA-DAH."

32:35.104 --> 32:37.053
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:37.054 --> 32:38.889
WHAT IF IT'S, LIKE --
WHAT IF HE --

32:38.924 --> 32:40.358
IF THAT'S THE WAY
HE TALKS?

32:40.393 --> 32:41.827
- LIKE, JUST PLAYING?
- YEAH.

32:41.862 --> 32:43.261
IT SOUNDS PLAYFUL,
KIND OF.

32:43.296 --> 32:44.260
YEAH. OKAY.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.013
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WHATEVER WAS THERE

32:46.048 --> 32:47.707
WAS NOT EVEN,
LIKE, TALKING TO US.

32:47.742 --> 32:49.088
IT WAS JUST DOING
ITS OWN THING.

32:49.123 --> 32:50.246
LIKE IT WAS PLAYING
WITH THE CARS.

32:50.281 --> 32:51.369
LIKE IT WAS PLAYING
WITH THE CARS.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.370
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK.

32:52.405 --> 32:53.904
- LIKE, "RAH!"
- YEAH.

32:53.939 --> 32:55.104
"HAH!" YEAH.

32:55.139 --> 32:57.773
WHATEVER'S HERE KNOWS
WHEN WE LEAVE THE ROOM.

32:57.808 --> 32:59.944
AND, IN FACT, I THINK IT PREFERS
WHEN WE'RE NOT AROUND

32:59.979 --> 33:02.547
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
IT STARTS DOING STUFF.

33:02.582 --> 33:05.116
WHAT IF WE JUST LEAVE IT
FOR A LITTLE BIT?

33:05.151 --> 33:06.149
YEAH.

33:06.184 --> 33:07.818
JUST GO, AND LET HIM
PLAY WITH THE CARS.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.185
YEAH.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.821
ERIC, DO YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH THOSE CARS?

33:10.856 --> 33:11.820
THEY'RE YOURS.

33:11.855 --> 33:13.440
GO AHEAD
AND PLAY WITH THEM, OKAY?

33:13.475 --> 33:15.025
LEAVE THE RECORDER DOWN
IN THAT CLOSET

33:15.026 --> 33:16.292
AND SEE IF WE GET
ANYTHING, TOO.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.063
YEAH. I THINK MAYBE
THAT MIGHT BE THE KEY,

33:19.098 --> 33:21.632
IS LEAVING THE RECORDER
DOWN THERE.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.533
THIS IS AMY AND ADAM.

33:23.568 --> 33:28.406
I AM PLACING THIS RECORDER
IN THE CLOSET IN ERIC'S ROOM.

33:33.162 --> 33:34.544
ADAM?

33:34.579 --> 33:35.846
I'M SORRY.
DID SOMETHING JUST TOUCH YOU?

33:35.881 --> 33:36.848
YES!

33:38.582 --> 33:40.067
HERE?

33:40.102 --> 33:41.517
YES!

33:41.552 --> 33:44.021
I DON'T SEE...
LIKE, THERE'S NO COBWEBS.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.556
NO. I THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA BE,

33:45.591 --> 33:47.525
LIKE, A BUG
OR SOMETHING.

33:51.762 --> 33:53.730
HEY. WERE YOU TOUCHING AMY?
IT'S OKAY IF YOU WERE.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.332
IT'S FINE.
WE WERE GETTING EXCITED.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.701
DON'T WORRY.

34:00.671 --> 34:03.173
ALL RIGHT, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID IT'S OKAY TO --

34:03.208 --> 34:04.540
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

34:04.575 --> 34:06.575
I MEAN,
I DON'T LOVE IT, BUT...

34:06.610 --> 34:09.045
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO GET
MY ATTENTION, THAT IS OKAY.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.614
ALL RIGHT?
THAT IS WHAT --

34:10.649 --> 34:12.800
YOU ARE ALLOWED.

34:12.835 --> 34:14.951
WAS THAT YOU, ERIC?

34:20.958 --> 34:23.995
ARE YOU THE PERSON
THAT STANDS IN THE CLOSET?

34:27.030 --> 34:28.931
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING
FROM US?

34:28.966 --> 34:30.902
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET OUR ATTENTION?

34:30.937 --> 34:33.670
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S LISTEN.

34:37.708 --> 34:38.672
I'M LIKE --

34:38.708 --> 34:40.310
I KNOW.
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.753
YOU KNOW,
IF HE'S MISCHIEVOUS,

34:49.788 --> 34:51.422
MAYBE IT GOES, "BOOP!"...

34:51.456 --> 34:52.621
AND RUNS OFF.

34:52.656 --> 34:56.123
...AND, LIKE, RUNS AWAY.

34:56.159 --> 35:00.431
I MEAN, EVERYTHING IT'S DOING
IS VERY MISCHIEVOUS.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.166
AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
THE FAMILY DESCRIBED.

35:03.166 --> 35:05.368
IT'S, LIKE,
TURNING THINGS OFF

35:05.403 --> 35:07.270
AND MAKING NOISES
IN THE OTHER ROOM

35:07.305 --> 35:10.841
AND MAKING NOISES UPSTAIRS
AND, YOU KNOW,

35:10.876 --> 35:13.876
TOUCHING ME
AND RUNNING OFF.

35:13.911 --> 35:16.280
I MEAN, IT'S NOT --
IT'S NOT INTERACTING.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.346
IT'S PLAYING.

35:17.381 --> 35:18.981
IT'S, LIKE,
THIS VERY PLAYFUL...

35:19.016 --> 35:22.019
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
IT'S, LIKE, MALICIOUSLY --

35:22.054 --> 35:24.487
LIKE BAD-INTENTION
MALICIOUS.

35:24.522 --> 35:28.593
I JUST WISH IT WOULD GIVE US
AN INDICATION OF WHO IT IS.

35:28.628 --> 35:30.861
LET'S LEAVE THE RECORDER
HERE OVERNIGHT AND SEE

35:30.896 --> 35:32.797
IF WE CAN GET
ANY MORE EVIDENCE.

35:39.069 --> 35:41.171
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
THE THE MISCHIEVOUS ACTIVITY

35:41.206 --> 35:42.772
COULD BE ERIC.

35:42.773 --> 35:45.007
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
CONCLUSIVE YET,

35:45.042 --> 35:47.979
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING
THROUGH THE EVIDENCE.

35:50.614 --> 35:51.880
ALL RIGHT.

35:51.915 --> 35:54.451
SO I WAS ABLE TO REVIEW
THE RECORDER FROM THE CLOSET,

35:54.486 --> 35:56.337
AND THERE'S NOTHING.

35:56.372 --> 35:58.198
I MEAN,
I CAN HEAR US.

35:58.233 --> 35:59.989
AND I CAN HEAR
A FEW SPOTS

36:00.024 --> 36:03.377
WHERE IT SOUNDS LIKE FOOTSTEPS
FROM UPSTAIRS,

36:03.412 --> 36:06.730
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
NOT ANYTHING ON THAT RECORDER.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.698
WELL, I FOUND
SOMETHING AMAZING.

36:08.733 --> 36:11.785
SO, I WAS REVIEWING
THE FULL-SPECTRUM FOOTAGE

36:11.820 --> 36:14.837
WHEN WE WERE FOCUSED
ON THE DOLLARS AND THE CARS.

36:14.838 --> 36:17.641
WE SET UP THE CARS FOR ERIC
AND SET UP THE DOLLARS FOR ERIC.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.640
AND WE LEFT THE ROOM.

36:18.675 --> 36:20.177
AND THE RECORDER
WAS SITTING THERE.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.877
AND, UM, JUST --

36:21.912 --> 36:24.115
YOU HAVE TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
TO ONE OF THE DOLLARS.

36:38.862 --> 36:41.199
YOU HAVE TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
TO ONE OF THE DOLLARS.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.936
SO BIZARRE.

36:46.971 --> 36:48.172
- DO IT AGAIN.
- IT'S GOING.

36:54.278 --> 36:56.113
WHAT'S REALLY COOL IS
IF YOU WATCH YOURSELF

36:56.148 --> 36:57.913
PUT THE DOLLARS DOWN,

36:57.914 --> 37:00.951
YOU PUT DOLLAR ONE DOWN,
YOU PUT DOLLAR TWO DOWN,

37:00.986 --> 37:02.319
AND THEN DOLLAR
THREE HITS DOLLAR TWO,

37:02.354 --> 37:03.585
AND JUST GOES BACK UP.

37:03.620 --> 37:04.721
YEAH, YOU'D THINK
THAT WOULD MAKE IT GO DOWN.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.856
- NOPE, STAYING UP.
- SO WEIRD!

37:06.891 --> 37:08.359
DO YOU HAVE A DOLLAR
IN YOUR POCKET?

37:08.394 --> 37:09.827
I'M GONNA GET A DOLLAR.

37:09.862 --> 37:11.963
ALL RIGHT.
SO HERE IS --

37:11.998 --> 37:14.030
THIS IS VERY MUCH LIKE --

37:14.065 --> 37:15.866
BUT THAT'S WHAT
IT SHOULD'VE DONE, RIGHT?

37:15.901 --> 37:18.334
BUT INSTEAD,
IT WENT, BLOOP!

37:18.369 --> 37:20.804
I LITERALLY CAN'T EVEN
MAKE IT DO THAT.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.338
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY
WENT LIKE THIS.

37:23.373 --> 37:25.910
WEIRD. THAT MAKES IT WEIRDER,
NOW THAT I'M SEEING.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.551
I THINK THE FIRST THING
WE WANT TO START WITH IS

37:34.586 --> 37:36.403
AN EVP
THAT WE ACTUALLY GOT.

37:36.438 --> 37:38.221
- AND YOU HEAR THIS.
- SO CRAZY.

37:38.222 --> 37:40.189
THIS IS WHAT
MAKES US THINK

37:40.224 --> 37:43.394
THAT THERE MIGHT BE
MORE THAN ONE THING HERE.

37:45.428 --> 37:47.696
"WE HAVE TO TOUCH IT."

37:47.731 --> 37:49.965
BUT IT SAYS,
"WE HAVE TO TOUCH IT."

37:50.000 --> 37:53.204
THAT LEADS US TO BELIEVE
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OF THEM.

37:53.239 --> 37:55.974
WONDERING WHO THE HECK THEY ARE.

37:56.009 --> 37:58.709
WE THINK IT'S SOMEONE
ATTACHED TO THE LAND.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.444
I FEEL LIKE IT
COULD BE ALMOST ANYONE.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.747
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT,
LIKE, THE CHELSEA FIRE IN 1908.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.547
THAT WAS LIKE
A MILE AWAY.

38:05.582 --> 38:08.368
AND THERE WERE 85 PEOPLE
PRESUMED DEAD.

38:08.403 --> 38:11.154
YOU KNOW, THE PERSON
THAT'S ON THAT SKETCH

38:11.155 --> 38:14.325
THAT ARIANNA HELPED US WITH
MATCHES THE TIME PERIOD

38:14.360 --> 38:16.925
OF THE FIRE THAT HAPPENED
NEARBY IN 1908.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.563
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.430
BUT BECAUSE IT WAS
SO LONG AGO,

38:21.465 --> 38:24.668
WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECORDS
TO CONFIRM FOR SURE.

38:24.703 --> 38:25.901
WE'VE GOTTEN NO EVIDENCE

38:25.936 --> 38:27.904
OF AGGRESSION
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.939
ARIANNA HAS ONLY
SEEN HIM ONCE.

38:29.974 --> 38:33.076
AND HE'S NEVER BEEN AGGRESSIVE
TOWARDS YOU IN THE PAST.

38:33.111 --> 38:36.147
WE DON'T THINK
HE'S HARMFUL IN ANY WAY.

38:36.182 --> 38:37.345
OKAY.

38:37.380 --> 38:40.466
BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE
ENTITY IN THE HOUSE.

38:40.501 --> 38:43.553
BECAUSE YOU HAD TOLD
ADAM THAT ERIC ENJOYED,

38:43.588 --> 38:45.721
- LIKE, MATCHBOX CARS...
- YEAH.

38:45.722 --> 38:49.059
...AND THINGS, WE SET UP
A ROW OF MATCHBOX CARS.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.827
AND WE HAD THE RECORDER
RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.163
AND THEN WE GOT THIS EVP.

38:52.198 --> 38:53.061
OKAY.

38:53.096 --> 38:54.296
WHAT WE NEED
YOUR HELP WITH HERE,

38:54.331 --> 38:56.867
IS WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE
IF THIS IS ERIC.

38:59.036 --> 39:00.170
DO YOU HEAR
THAT KIND OF --

39:00.205 --> 39:02.673
- "KAPOW!"
- YEAH.

39:02.708 --> 39:05.107
MY GOODNESS.

39:05.142 --> 39:06.710
THAT'S WHAT ERIC WOULD DO.

39:06.745 --> 39:07.678
REALLY?

39:10.447 --> 39:12.949
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
HE WOULD DO THAT?

39:12.984 --> 39:15.217
HE WOULD LINE HIS CARS UP.

39:15.252 --> 39:16.687
AND JUST LIKE
THE LITTLE KIDS, YOU KNOW,

39:16.722 --> 39:18.372
YOU GET THE OTHER CAR,
GO FAST.

39:18.407 --> 39:19.988
- BOOM, LIKE THAT.
- MY GOD.

39:20.023 --> 39:22.492
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT ERIC WOULD DO.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.927
WE ALSO TALKED
ABOUT DOLLAR BILLS.

39:24.962 --> 39:27.530
AND YOU SAID
THAT HE COUNTED MONEY IN ONES.

39:27.565 --> 39:29.567
- RIGHT.
- IF YOU WATCH HERE...

39:32.269 --> 39:36.138
- MY GOD.
- MY GOD.

39:36.139 --> 39:37.505
JUST THAT ONE DOLLAR BILL.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.009
SAYS, "IT'S OKAY.
THAT'S ENOUGH."

39:39.044 --> 39:40.342
AND IT STAYS DOWN.

39:40.377 --> 39:42.712
IT DOESN'T MOVE.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.315
LET'S SEE IT
ONE MORE TIME.

39:46.917 --> 39:48.401
MY GOODNESS.

39:48.436 --> 39:49.962
LIKE HE JUST WENT --

39:49.997 --> 39:51.453
YEAH, PUSHED IT DOWN.

39:51.488 --> 39:53.656
YEAH.
THAT'S DEFINITELY ERIC.

39:53.657 --> 39:54.858
DEFINITELY ERIC.

39:54.893 --> 39:55.891
YEAH.

39:55.926 --> 39:57.628
AND KNOWING AFTER
WHAT HE WENT THROUGH,

39:57.663 --> 40:00.929
THAT HE STILL HAS THAT IN HIM

40:00.964 --> 40:02.666
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL
BETTER ABOUT THAT.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.434
GOOD.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.069
DO YOU FEEL
GOOD ENOUGH ABOUT IT

40:07.104 --> 40:11.274
TO MAYBE TO GO DOWN THERE
AND TALK TO HIM A LITTLE BIT?

40:11.275 --> 40:13.177
I HAVE TO GO
IN MY ROOM FOR A MINUTE.

40:13.212 --> 40:14.645
OKAY. YEAH.

40:21.018 --> 40:22.319
- IS SHE OKAY?
- SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.037
- OKAY.
- SHE'LL BE OKAY.

40:24.072 --> 40:25.721
UM, I'M JUST REALLY GLAD

40:25.722 --> 40:29.993
THAT WE WERE ABLE
TO GET ANSWERS.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.362
- I AM, TOO.
- AND VERIFY.

40:31.397 --> 40:32.328
AND VERIFY.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.529
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
SHE NEEDED.

40:33.564 --> 40:35.131
BECAUSE WE JUST DIDN'T
WANT HER TO BE AFRAID

40:35.166 --> 40:37.067
IN HER OWN HOUSE
ANYMORE.

40:39.069 --> 40:40.769
YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:40.804 --> 40:43.240
I'M JUST TRYING TO
COLLECT MY EMOTIONS, THAT'S ALL.

40:43.275 --> 40:44.475
I KNOW.

40:47.478 --> 40:49.180
I COULD TRY.

41:05.228 --> 41:07.164
YOU OKAY?

41:13.570 --> 41:16.572
SO MANY MEMORIES.

41:16.607 --> 41:19.441
THINK OF ALL
THE GOOD ONES.

41:19.476 --> 41:21.011
I HAVE TO THINK
OF THE GOOD ONES.

41:21.046 --> 41:22.244
ALL THE GOOD ONES.

41:22.279 --> 41:25.950
I GOT TO THINK OF THE BETTER
MEMORIES THERE WAS.

41:29.787 --> 41:33.290
ERIC, YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE ME STRENGTH TO CONTINUE,

41:33.325 --> 41:37.059
TO BE HERE AGAIN
IN OUR OWN HOME WITH YOU.

41:37.094 --> 41:40.497
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET ANYBODY
TAKE IT AWAY FROM US.

41:40.532 --> 41:43.451
I LOVE YOU,
AND I MISS YOU.

41:43.486 --> 41:46.079
I MISS OUR TIMES TOGETHER.

41:46.114 --> 41:48.672
I MISS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

41:51.008 --> 41:55.011
I WISH YOU NEVER HAD TO GO
THROUGH WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.578
WASN'T FAIR.

41:56.613 --> 41:59.381
I WISH I WAS HERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

41:59.382 --> 42:02.719
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE
HERE TO PROTECT ME NOW.

42:02.754 --> 42:06.156
ERIC, I LOVE YOU.

42:06.191 --> 42:09.558
LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

42:09.559 --> 42:10.828
REALLY DO.

42:12.896 --> 42:16.300
I CAN'T HELP BUT GET
EMOTIONAL ON CASES LIKE THIS

42:16.335 --> 42:18.619
BECAUSE WE CAME IN
TO FIND A BROKEN WOMAN,

42:18.654 --> 42:20.904
AND WE WERE ABLE
TO GIVE HER SOME PEACE.

42:20.939 --> 42:21.803
YOU DID IT.

42:21.838 --> 42:24.057
YES, I DID IT.
THANK YOU.

42:24.092 --> 42:26.552
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.978
YOU'RE SO WELCOME.

42:29.013 --> 42:31.181
I DON'T THINK
I COULD'VE DONE IT ALONE.
