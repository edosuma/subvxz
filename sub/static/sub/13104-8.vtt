WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.093
(siren wails)

00:04.130 --> 00:06.189
(Carmen Townsend's
"Without My Love" playing)

00:06.240 --> 00:07.696
(Gail) so ROMANTIC.

00:07.740 --> 00:08.695
(thud)

00:08.740 --> 00:09.707
UH, WHAT WAS THAT?

00:09.740 --> 00:10.707
(Nick) I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.004
* GIVE HER A GO *

00:13.040 --> 00:15.838
* STILL BUSTED BROKE,
THERE'S NO BANKIN' ON THIS *

00:15.880 --> 00:17.905
* HEART OF GOLD *

00:17.950 --> 00:18.905
OW!

00:18.950 --> 00:20.349
SORRY.
JUST A NAIL.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.779
OKAY?
JUST A NAIL.

00:21.820 --> 00:28.259
* IF SHE COULD BE AS
LOYAL AS THE LOW FUEL LIGHT *

00:28.290 --> 00:32.021
* LOYAL AS THE LOW, LOW, LOW *

00:32.060 --> 00:34.051
(pants)

00:36.100 --> 00:37.988
HEY, UM, MAYBE--
MAYBE THIS WASN'T

00:38.030 --> 00:40.294
THE RIGHT PLACE TO,
UH, TO DO THIS. HMM?

00:40.340 --> 00:42.103
YOUR CAR'S OUT BACK.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.563
YEAH. YEAH, LET'S DO IT
IN THE PARKING LOT.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.271
THAT'S SUPER STEALTH.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.001
YOU WANT TO COME BACK
TO MY PLACE?

00:49.040 --> 00:51.076
I'M ALLERGIC TO
YOUR CHEAP SHEETS, REMEMBER?

00:51.110 --> 00:53.476
OKAY, PRINCESS.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.149
HOW ABOUT YOUR PLACE?
PARENTS ARE OUT OF TOWN, RIGHT?

00:57.190 --> 01:01.479
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S JUST THAT
THEY'RE REDOING THE ROOF, AND...

01:01.520 --> 01:04.125
I'M STAYING AT ANDY'S, SO...

01:06.300 --> 01:07.892
OKAY.

01:07.930 --> 01:08.897
(sighs)

01:08.930 --> 01:11.091
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

01:11.130 --> 01:14.167
(sighs)

01:14.200 --> 01:17.067
YOU RELAX. I'M NOT GONNA
ASK YOU TO CUDDLE ME, OKAY?

01:17.110 --> 01:20.238
OH. NO, I KNOW. YOU'RE NOT
EXACTLY THE GIRLFRIEND TYPE.

01:20.280 --> 01:24.102
GUYS INVITED ME FOR A BEER AT
THE PENNY, IF YOU WANT TO COME.

01:24.150 --> 01:28.246
GIRLS WON'T FLIRT WITH YOU
IF I'M THERE, RIGHT? BUDDY?

01:28.280 --> 01:31.215
RIGHT, 'CAUSE ACTUALLY
HANGING OUT ISN'T ALLOWED.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.512
SAYS WHO?

01:32.560 --> 01:35.051
SAYS YOU, LIKE,
A MILLION TIMES.

01:35.090 --> 01:36.853
YOU KEEP SAYING
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, SO...

01:38.430 --> 01:40.523
THEN I GUESS
I'M GETTING WHAT I WANT.

01:45.370 --> 01:47.292
(Andy) EW. THESE ARE so GROSS.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.295
HEY.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.307
HEY.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.637
HEY.

01:50.670 --> 01:54.037
(sighs) ANDY, WHY DID YOU
BUY THESE? LOOK AT THEIR--

01:54.080 --> 01:55.934
THEY'RE ZOMBIE BRIDES.
LOOK AT THEIR SMILES.

01:55.980 --> 01:57.402
I KNOW.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.543
YOU HAVE TO START PRACT ICING,
THOUGH, 'CAUSE VERY SOON,

01:59.580 --> 02:00.911
EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE
WATCHING YOU.

02:00.950 --> 02:03.510
DON'T. I CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
WALKING DOWN THE AISLE

02:03.550 --> 02:05.984
AND HAVING
ALL EYES STARING AT ME.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.056
ALTHOUGH
I THINK I TALKED JERRY

02:08.090 --> 02:10.479
INTO A-A WEDDING
IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.748
REALLY? DESTINATION WEDDING?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.290
WANT TO KEEP IT SMALL,

02:14.330 --> 02:16.560
BUT YOU AND SAM WILL COME,
THOUGH, RIGHT?
YEAH, OF COURSE.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.239
COULD TAKE SOME VACATION TIME,
MAKE A REAL HOLIDAY OUT OF IT.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.465
YEAH, I CAN'T EVEN PICTURE
SAM ON VACATION.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.865
HE DOESN'T EVEN OWN SHORTS.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.832
I DON'T MEAN TO BE
A PARTY POOPER,

02:24.870 --> 02:27.031
BUT YOU DID OFFER ME
THE COUCH, RIGHT?

02:27.080 --> 02:28.331
YEAH.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.543
WELL...
I'D KIND OF LIKE TO USE IT,

02:31.580 --> 02:33.548
'CAUSE I'M PRE'ITY TIRED,

02:33.580 --> 02:35.969
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR GIGGLES TO THE BEDROOM?

02:36.020 --> 02:37.715
WHOA.
OKAY.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.456
YOU ARE SUCH A CHARMER.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.987
(sighs)

02:43.030 --> 02:45.555
(Traci) GOOD NIGHT, GAIL.

02:45.590 --> 02:48.798
(Eux Autres) * SO I'M NOT
COMING HOME TONIGHT *

02:48.830 --> 02:50.468
(Andy speaks indistinctly)

02:50.500 --> 02:52.365
(Traci) IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.867
(Andy speaks indistinctly)

02:53.900 --> 02:55.936
(Traci laughs
and speaks indistinctly)

02:55.970 --> 02:57.961
* WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME *

03:00.980 --> 03:03.369
SO THE WEDDING'S GONNA BE
IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

03:03.410 --> 03:05.446
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
WE COULD TAKE A WEEK OR TWO

03:05.480 --> 03:07.573
AND HAVE OUR FIRST
VACATION TOGETHER.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.884
GREAT.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.083
W--COME ON. WE'VE NEVER
BEEN ANYWHERE TOGETHER.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.553
I MEAN, WE'VE NEVER
BEEN TO A COTTAGE,

03:14.590 --> 03:15.887
WE'VE NEVER EVEN
BEEN CAMPING...

03:15.920 --> 03:16.921
WE WENT TO SUDBURY.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.224
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT.
HOW ROMANTIC.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.420
(gun racks)

03:20.460 --> 03:22.223
COME ON. YOUR BEST FRIEND
AND MY BEST FRIEND

03:22.270 --> 03:24.864
ARE GE'I'I'ING MARRIED.
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.231
(holsters gun)

03:26.270 --> 03:28.033
WHAT'S WRONG WITH CITY HALL?

03:28.070 --> 03:30.300
CITY HALL? THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF A DREAM WEDDING?

03:30.340 --> 03:32.570
WHY DO PEOPLE
HAVE TO GET MARRIED AT ALL?

03:32.610 --> 03:36.000
(pOlice radiO chatter)

03:36.040 --> 03:38.008
(door buzzes and beeps)

03:38.050 --> 03:40.018
(indistinct conversations)

03:40.050 --> 03:43.281
(door closes)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ME AND YOU,

03:43.320 --> 03:45.242
AFTER THE CEREMONY,

03:45.290 --> 03:49.784
TAKING OFF ON THIS? HMM?

03:49.830 --> 03:53.459
AND WE JUST SAIL AWAY
UNDER THE STARS, ME AND YOU.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.991
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SAIL.

03:56.030 --> 03:58.123
HOW HARD COULD IT BE
TO DRIVE A BOAT?

03:58.170 --> 04:00.934
BUT THE LAST TIME THAT YOU
WENT OUT WITH THE MARINE UNIT,

04:00.970 --> 04:02.130
YOU FELL IN THE WATER,

04:02.170 --> 04:04.365
AND THE DIVE TEAM
HAD TO PULL YOU OUT.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.661
UM...

04:05.710 --> 04:09.305
THE WATER WAS CHOPPY,
AND I HAD THAT INNER EAR THING.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.306
(chuckles)

04:12.450 --> 04:14.111
YOU HATE THE BOAT.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.345
I DO NOT HATE THE BOAT.

04:16.390 --> 04:20.281
IT IS VERY SWEET AND ROMANTIC.
IT'S JUST...

04:20.320 --> 04:22.481
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT WE'D KEEP IT SIMPLE.

04:22.530 --> 04:27.297
MY MOM AND LEO,
YOUR FAMILY, OUR FRIENDS.

04:27.330 --> 04:29.025
IS THAT OKAY?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.596
NO WORRIES.

04:30.630 --> 04:31.699
ARE YOU SURE?

04:31.730 --> 04:33.334
SIMPLE IS SIMPLE,

04:33.370 --> 04:36.339
AND YOU ARE THE BRIDE.
(kisses)

04:40.680 --> 04:44.104
ALL RIGHT. ASSIGNMENTS ARE ON
THE BOARD. IT'S CHANGE-UP DAY.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.074
YOU'VE ALL GOT NEW PARTNERS,
$0 GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.940
KEEPS YOU MORE ALERT
ON THE ROAD.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.585
AND ON A PERSONAL NOTE,

04:51.620 --> 04:55.078
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR YOUR BABY NAME SUGGESTIONS,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.657
BUT AFI'ER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION,

04:57.690 --> 04:59.954
I WILL NOT BE
NAMING MY CHILD "NINJA."

05:00.000 --> 05:01.251
TOLD YOU.
(officers groaning)

05:01.300 --> 05:02.961
OR "OLIVER."

05:03.000 --> 05:04.797
I WEEP FOR THAT CHILD.

05:04.830 --> 05:05.797
(laughter)

05:05.830 --> 05:07.229
THAT IS YOUR LOSS,
MY FRIEND.

05:07.270 --> 05:10.103
I KNOW. ALL RIGHT.
DISMISSED. GO.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.132
(indistinct conversations)

05:18.880 --> 05:20.370
UH, OLIVER?

05:20.420 --> 05:21.409
YEAH.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.611
DOV AND I
ARE PARTNERS TODAY,

05:23.650 --> 05:25.140
BUT WE ALREADY
KNOW EACH OTHER.

05:25.190 --> 05:28.284
WELL, UH, HOW WELL
DO WE REALLY KNOW ANYONE?

05:28.320 --> 05:30.550
PRETTY WELL, YOU KNOW.
WE'RE ROOMMATES.

05:30.590 --> 05:33.388
IT'S TRUE. SOMETIMES I DO
HIS DIRTY LAUNDRY BY MISTAKE.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.749
WHAT'S HIS MIDDLE NAME?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.927
BILL.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.790
T-TED.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.832
YOU PUT MONEY ON THAT?

05:41.900 --> 05:43.037
SEE?

05:43.070 --> 05:45.709
SO MUCH TO LEARN.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.937
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I
ACTUALLY COMPLETELY LOST TRACK.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.540
THOSE SHOTS JUST KEPT APPEARING
IN FRONT OF ME. IT WAS INSANE.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.572
I KNOW. I HAVEN'T HAD
A BOILERMAKER SINCE THE ACADEMY.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.178
NORMALLY,
I DON'T DRINK LIKE THAT,

05:56.220 --> 05:58.814
BUT YOU ARE
A VERY BARHINFLUENCE.

05:58.850 --> 06:00.909
(giggleS)
HEY.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.587
HELLO.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.748
COLLINS, LET'S GO.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.257
LATER, GUYS.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.494
BYE.

06:08.530 --> 06:11.363
SO DID YOU SLEEP WITH HIM
LAST NIGHT OR SOMETHING?

06:11.400 --> 06:14.062
NO. I WISH.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.658
SORRY.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.565
YOU GUYS, LIKE,
A THING OR SOME--

06:17.610 --> 06:20.078
OH, GOD, NO.
NO, NOT AT ALL.

06:20.110 --> 06:22.374
YOU KNOW WHAT? I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.071
WHAT?

06:24.110 --> 06:26.647
OKAY. YOU DIDN'T
HEAR THIS FROM ME.

06:26.680 --> 06:31.242
HE SORT OF... CAUGHT SOMETHING
OVER IN AFGHANISTAN.

06:32.890 --> 06:36.087
(whispers indistinctly)

06:36.120 --> 06:37.326
OH.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.328
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.896
NOW IT'S LIKE...

06:40.930 --> 06:42.795
YEAH.

06:42.830 --> 06:45.128
(sirens wail in distance)

06:45.170 --> 06:46.694
OKAY, I GOTTA
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.890
MM-HMM.
DO ALL GUYS HATE WEDDINGS?

06:48.940 --> 06:50.669
I DON'T KNOW.
I LIKE WEDDINGS.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.270
OPEN BAR, DANCING,
MEETING NEW PEOPLE...

06:53.310 --> 06:55.335
YES. THANK YOU. EXACTLY.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.109
YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
TO TELL SAM THAT.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.516
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC'S
GONNA BE LIKE A VACATION.

06:59.550 --> 07:02.348
OOH, WELL, A VACATION--
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.189
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:04.220 --> 07:06.245
IT'S A BIG STEP--
JUST THE TWO OF YOU,

07:06.290 --> 07:07.814
NO DISTRACTIONS--
YOU GOTTA BE SURE.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.054
YOU KNOW,

07:09.090 --> 07:10.921
WHAT IF ALL THE FASCINATING
CONVERSATION RUNS OUT,

07:10.960 --> 07:13.190
YOU'RE LEFT WITH NOTHING
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER? THEN WHAT?

07:13.230 --> 07:14.424
THEN YOU STILL GOT THE BEACH.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.757
WELL,
YOU ALWAYS GOT THE BEACH.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.394
(woman) Unit 1509, are you 10-8?

07:18.430 --> 07:19.419
(radio static)
GO AHEAD.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.392
(radio static)
Attend 1801 King Street

07:21.440 --> 07:22.805
regarding
a domestic disturbance.
(radio static)

07:22.840 --> 07:24.205
1509, WE'RE ON IT.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.970
(woman) GET OUT OF
MY APARTMENT RIGHT NOW.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.807

07:28.840 --> 07:30.341
THEN I'LL HAVE SECURITY...

07:30.380 --> 07:32.439
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED!
(shouting indistinctly)

07:32.480 --> 07:34.175

07:34.220 --> 07:35.346
POLICE! OPEN UP! OH.
(woman) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

07:35.380 --> 07:37.018
OH.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.211
(Nick) POLICE! WE'RE COMING IN!
HOW DO YOU EVEN
KNOW WHERE I LIVE?!

07:39.250 --> 07:42.720
I KNOW WHAT YOU Do.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MADE HER DO!
(Nick) WHOA! STOP! STOP.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.024
(pants) OFFICER. GOOD.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.494
LISTEN, MY--MY--
MY GIRLFRIEND'S MISSING.

07:47.530 --> 07:49.760
LIZ ADAMS.
SHE'S BEEN GONE A WEEK NOW.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.995
I CAN'T FIND HER,
AND SHE WON'T CALL ME BACK.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.133
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

07:53.170 --> 07:55.138
THAT SHE MIGHT NOT
WANT TO TALK TO YOU?

07:55.170 --> 07:57.138
YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS!
OKAY, OKAY, COME ON,
LET'S CALM DOWN,

07:57.170 --> 07:59.570
STEP OUTSIDE IN THE HALL,
HAVE A CHAT, ALL RIGHT?

07:59.610 --> 08:00.577
YOU OKAY?

08:00.610 --> 08:01.804
YEAH.

08:02.810 --> 08:04.209
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.501
RACHEL FINDLAY.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.347
LOOK, THIS IS MY APARTMENT,

08:07.380 --> 08:09.211
AND THAT MAN
HAS NO RIGHT BEING HERE.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.286
CAN YOU PLEASE
MAKE SURE THAT HE LEAVES?

08:11.320 --> 08:13.880
ABSOLUTELY. OFFICER COLLINS
IS GONNA CALM HIM DOWN.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.629
UM, LIZ ADAMS--HE SAID THAT
SHE WAS MISSING. YOU KNOW HER?

08:17.660 --> 08:19.423
NOT VERY WELL.

08:19.460 --> 08:20.950
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU DO?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.629
I'M A STUDENT.
UM, I'M GETTING MY M.B.A.

08:24.670 --> 08:28.458
(police radio chatter)

08:28.500 --> 08:31.264
SO YOUR GIRLFRIEND--SHE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU BEFORE SHE LEFT?

08:31.310 --> 08:33.778
YOU TWO HAVE A FIGHT?
ANYTHING?

08:33.810 --> 08:35.732
I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED,
SOMETHING BAD.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.544
IT'S RACHEL'S FAULT.
SHE GOT HER INTO THIS.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.138
OKAY. RACHEL. WHY?

08:40.180 --> 08:42.887
SHE'S LIZ'S PIMP,
OR--OR MADAM.

08:42.920 --> 08:44.740
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU CALL IT.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.111
SO YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
A PROSTITUTE?

08:47.160 --> 08:50.152
AN ESCORT.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

08:50.190 --> 08:52.249
LIZ AND I HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR TWO YEARS,

08:52.290 --> 08:56.989
AND SHE'S BEEN LYING TO ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.065
IF THIS WOMAN'S MISSING,

08:58.100 --> 08:59.067
YOU NEED TO ANSWER
OUR QUESTIONS.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.533
I DON'T SEE A WARRANT.

09:00.570 --> 09:02.959
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE DON'T HAVE A WARRANT...

09:03.010 --> 09:05.160
BUT WE CAN GET ONE.
IT'S JUST GONNA BE A HASSLE.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.609
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SEIZE YOUR COMPUTERS

09:06.640 --> 09:09.848
AND ALL YOUR RECORDS,
MAKE CALLS TO ALL YOUR CLIENTS.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.269
I THINK I'M GONNA
CALL MY LAWYER.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.413
RACHEL,
YOUR FRIEND IS MISSING.

09:13.450 --> 09:14.474
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.839
SHE'S PROBABLY OUT OF TOWN.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.041
MAYBE, BUT YOU RUN
AN ESCORT AGENCY--

09:18.090 --> 09:20.581
ELITE COMPANIONS
IS NOT AN ESCORT AGENCY.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.952
THE GIRLS PROVIDE
COMPANIONSHIP. THAT'S IT.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.355
OHH.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.597
WELL, IF LIZ IS HURT, AND ONE
OF HER JOHNS IS INVOLVED,

09:26.630 --> 09:27.699
THEN YOU'LL BE LIABLE.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.527
FORGET LIABLE.
YOU'LL BE CHARGED.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.118
(police radio chatter)

09:31.170 --> 09:32.694
LIZ GET ANY CALLS RECENTLY?

09:32.740 --> 09:33.968
I DON'T KNOW.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.639
SHE MANAGES HER OWN BOOKINGS.
IT'S ALL DONE ONLINE.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.069
OKAY.
WELL, HOW ABOUT A PASSWORD?

09:38.110 --> 09:40.533
WE CAN START WITH THAT.

09:40.580 --> 09:45.643
(keys clicking)
OKAY, HERE SHE IS. "LIZ ADAMS."
PROFESSIONAL NAME--"AMBER."

09:45.680 --> 09:47.147
(mouse clicks)

09:47.180 --> 09:49.546
$1,500 FOR DINNER
AND CONVERSATION?

09:49.580 --> 09:50.808
(Dov) AND SEX.

09:50.850 --> 09:53.318
NO, NO, NO, NO. 3 GRAND
FOR AN "INTIMATE ENCOUNTER."

09:53.360 --> 09:55.954
OKAY, YOU GUYS,
SHE HASN'T BEEN GOING TO CLASS.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.753
AIRLINES DON'T HAVE HER
ON ANY FLIGHT LISTS,

09:57.790 --> 09:59.553
AND THERE'S NO ACTIVITY
ON HER CREDIT CARD.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.626
WELL, THAT SAID, SHE COULD BE
HIDING OUT, PAYING CASH.

10:01.660 --> 10:02.968
IT'S A CASH BUSINESS, RIGHT?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.820
WE HAD ANOTHER ESCORT
FROM THAT AGENCY

10:04.870 --> 10:06.360
THAT WENT MISSING A MONTH AGO.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.334
HER NAME IS NICOLE MARSHALL.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.531
IT'S ONE OF JERRY'S CASES,
AND IT'S STILL ACTIVE.

10:10.570 --> 10:13.630
SHE CALLED 9-1-1,
AND THEN SHE DISAPPEARED.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.908
HER CONDO WAS IMMACULATE.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.646
THERE WAS NO SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE,

10:16.680 --> 10:18.602
NO D.N.A., NO FINGERPRINTS,
NOTHING.

10:18.650 --> 10:22.347
NICOLE MARSHALL--LAST SEEN
A MONTH AGO--AUGUST 28.
(beeps)

10:22.380 --> 10:23.711
(man) 9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

10:23.750 --> 10:25.081
(woman)
There's someone at my door.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.587
I think he's trying
to break in. Please--

10:26.620 --> 10:28.315
Okay, ma'am? Try and stay calm.
What's your name?

10:28.360 --> 10:29.884
Nicole Marshall.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.727
Okay, Nicole?
The police are on their way.
(knock on door)

10:31.760 --> 10:33.193
He won't stop knocking.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.822
I can't see who he is,
and he won't answer.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.521
THEY ACTUALLY LOOK
PRETTY SIMILAR--

10:36.560 --> 10:39.427
BLONDE,
LONG HAIR, FAIR SKIN.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.267
WHAT, YOU THINK
THERE'S A CONNECTION?

10:41.300 --> 10:44.701
UH, OKAY, GUYS, I HAVE A LIST
OF ALL LIZ ADAMS' CLIENTS.

10:44.740 --> 10:45.707
THERE AREN'T THAT MANY.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.503
COUPLE OF REGULARS,
ONCE-WEEKLIES.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.543
INCLUDING THE GUY SHE WENT ON
A DATE WITH AT THE ARCHER HOTEL

10:50.580 --> 10:53.617
THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED--
"NiceGuy 76."

10:53.650 --> 10:54.969
THIS GUY SEE
ANY OTHER ESCORTS?

10:55.020 --> 10:59.218
UH, I GOT A LIST OF ALL HIS

10:59.250 --> 11:00.751
"NICOLE MARSHALL."

11:00.790 --> 11:03.554
PROFESSIONAL NAME--VALENTINA.
AUGUST 28.

11:05.390 --> 11:08.757
WE HAVE TWO ESCORTS,
BOTH FROM THE SAME AGENCY.

11:08.800 --> 11:14.432
BOTH WENT MISSING AFTER A DATE
AT THE ARCHER WITH NiceGuy 76.

11:14.470 --> 11:15.835
(Frank) "LIZ ADAMS."

11:15.870 --> 11:18.430
YOU TRACED HER CREDIT CARDS,
CELL PHONE RECORDS?

11:18.470 --> 11:21.871
LAST CALL WAS TO HER BOYFRIEND
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED,

11:21.910 --> 11:24.344
AND NOW HER PHONE'S OFF,
SO WE CAN'T TRACK IT.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.769
IT'S BEEN A WEEK, FRANK.
THE CLOCK'S RUNNING DOWN.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.447
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.619
WELL, THE ESCORT AGENCY
IS COOPERATING.

11:30.650 --> 11:33.016
WE KNOW THE JOHN'S GOT ANOTHER
BOOKING TONIGHT WITH A GIRL

11:33.060 --> 11:34.584
AT HIS FAVORITE HOTEL ROOM.
(buzzer, beep)

11:34.620 --> 11:36.986
WE FIGURE WE BRING HIM IN,
AND WE, UH, KEEP HIM FOR QUES--

11:37.030 --> 11:39.157
PULL HER, AND PUT ME IN.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.293
PUT YOU IN?

11:40.330 --> 11:41.957
YEAH, I MEAN,
I FIT THE PATTERN, RIGHT?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.924
BOTH GIRLS ARE BLONDE, MID-20$.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.494
I MEAN, I'M RIGHT IN
HIS SNACK BRACKET.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.930
PECK, THESE ARE
HIGH-END ESCORTS.

11:48.970 --> 11:52.838
SIR. I VISITED EVERY COUNTRY
IN EUROPE BEFORE I WAS 18.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.279
JE PARLE FRANCAIS.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.369
SHE HASN'T HAD
THE PROPER TRAINING.

11:56.410 --> 11:57.570
SO LET'S TRAIN HER.

11:57.610 --> 11:58.975
WE GOT THE FOXY BROWN
OF UNDERCOVER ESCORTS

11:59.010 --> 12:00.079
IN-HOUSE, RIGHT?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.816
HOTEL ROOM RAID OF '98--
7 JOHNS ARRESTED.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.284
MORALITY SQUAD WANTED HER
FOR MONTHS AFTER THAT, RIGHT?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.912
OKAY, WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.019
OFFICER WILLIAMS.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.483
NOELLE?

12:11.530 --> 12:13.998
(police radio chatter)

12:14.030 --> 12:16.521
DON'T MAKE ME REGRET THIS.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.439
(pats arm)
THERE YOU GO.

12:23.270 --> 12:26.103
OKAY, YOUR PROFILE
IS YOUR FIRST POINT OF CONTACT

12:26.140 --> 12:28.677
WITH THE JOHN, SO IT HAS TO
PROJECT THE RIGHT IMAGE.

12:28.710 --> 12:31.178
HOW ABOUT ANASTASIA?
OR FRANCESCA?

12:31.210 --> 12:32.347
I'M NOT A DRAG QUEEN.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.611
I NEED SOMETHING
THAT'S CLASSY AND EXOTIC.

12:35.650 --> 12:38.380
(sighs) ARIEL? OR BELLE?

12:38.420 --> 12:39.956
YOU'RE NAMING PRINCESSES.

12:39.990 --> 12:41.548
OR JASMINE?

12:41.590 --> 12:43.922
JASMINE. YOU COULD
TOTALLY MAKE THAT WORK.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.427
ALL RIGHT.
JASMINE'S FINE. JUST...

12:45.460 --> 12:47.519
(keyboard clicks)
READ IT BACK TO ME.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.050
ALL RIGHT.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.934
"TREAT YOURSELF TO A LUXURIOUS
RENDEZVOUS WITH JASMINE.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.689
"JASMINE ENJOYS
SHARING DELICIOUS MEALS

12:55.740 --> 12:57.469
AND STIMULATING CONVERSATION."

12:57.510 --> 12:59.808
YEAH, "STIMULATING"
HAS ONE "L."

13:01.310 --> 13:03.642
GRAMMAR COUNTS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M LEAVING.

13:03.680 --> 13:04.647
(keyboard clicks)

13:04.680 --> 13:06.910
ALL RIGHT. SHE IS RIGHT.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.941
THESE GUYS--
THEY WANT EDUCATED WOMEN.

13:08.980 --> 13:11.289
ALL RIGHT, AND WE NEED
TO ADD SOMETHING.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.548
UH...

13:12.590 --> 13:15.354
"LET HER FILL YOUR NEED

13:15.390 --> 13:17.984
FOR THE ULTIMATE
GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE."

13:18.030 --> 13:19.725
GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE?

13:19.760 --> 13:20.920
OKAY, GET IT
OUT OF YOUR HEAD

13:20.960 --> 13:22.427
THAT YOU'RE A HOOKER
IN A BETTER OUTFIT.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.325
THESE ARE POWERFUL MEN

13:24.370 --> 13:26.429
WITH STRESSFUL JOBS.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.789
THEY WANNA TELL YOU THINGS

13:27.840 --> 13:29.535
THAT THEY WON'T EVEN TELL
THEIR WIVES.

13:29.570 --> 13:31.959
YOUR JOB IS TO LISTEN,
MAKE 'EM FEEL LIKE

13:32.010 --> 13:34.774
THEY CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING.
MAKE 'EM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

13:34.810 --> 13:37.699
THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN
IN THE ROOM.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.149
CAN YOU DO THAT?

13:39.180 --> 13:41.011
(breathy voice) ABSOLUTELY.
OKAY, NO.

13:41.050 --> 13:42.540
NO, SEE, THAT'S
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE.

13:42.580 --> 13:43.808
DON'T TRY TO BE SEXY.

13:43.850 --> 13:48.617
JUST... YOU HAVE TO BE REAL.

13:48.660 --> 13:49.718
THIS HARD DRIVE HOLDS

13:49.760 --> 13:53.252
40 HOURS
OF DIGITIZED 9-1-1 CALLS.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.029
NOW ALL OF THESE CAME IN

13:55.060 --> 13:58.564
THE WEEK AFTER, UH,
NICOLE MARSHALL DISAPPEARED.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.489
(crunching)
YOU TWO ARE GOING TO
LISTEN TO THE CALLS--

14:01.540 --> 14:04.008
ALL OF THE CALLS.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.203
WE'RE LOOKING FOR PATTERNS,
NEW EVIDENCE, ANYTHING.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.276
NOW MOST OF THE CALLS ARE
GONNA SEEM UNRELATED.

14:09.310 --> 14:11.039
AND IF NOT,
THEY'RE A PRANK.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.399
ALL RIGHT,
BUT THERE IS NO SKIPPING.

14:12.450 --> 14:13.610
ABSOLUTELY NO SKIPPING.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.971
YOU ARE GOING TO LISTEN
TO EVERY SINGLE CALL

14:16.020 --> 14:17.146
IN ITS ENTIRETY.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.284
ARE WE BEING PUNISHED
FOR SOMETHING?

14:20.320 --> 14:21.355
POLICE OFFICERS,
AREN'T YOU?

14:21.390 --> 14:22.709
YEAH.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.684
WELL, THIS IS WHAT
POLICE OFFICERS DO.
(Dov crunching)

14:25.730 --> 14:26.822
GIVE ME A CHIP THERE, PAL.

14:26.860 --> 14:30.023
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED THESE.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.664
(crunches)

14:32.700 --> 14:34.065
OLIVER?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.465
WHAT?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.207
YOU'RE A JOHN.
YOU'RE A CLIENT WHO'S BOOKED ME.
(hits shoulder)

14:38.240 --> 14:39.264
I AM?

14:39.310 --> 14:41.938
YEAH. SIT.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.402
(crunches)

14:43.450 --> 14:46.044
(whispers) ALL RIGHT.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.947
(sighs)

14:48.980 --> 14:50.208
HI.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.480
HI.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.215
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.251
I'M GISELLE.

14:56.290 --> 14:57.484
HEY, GISELLE.

14:57.530 --> 15:01.557
AND, UH, YOU ARE...

15:01.600 --> 15:02.965
PETER.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.719
OKAY. PETER. PETER WHAT?

15:05.770 --> 15:07.738
PETER...

15:07.770 --> 15:09.533
PETER... PARKER.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.561
(chuckles)

15:11.610 --> 15:13.202
THAT'S FUNNY.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.732
UM, BUT I DON'T KNOW.
I...

15:16.780 --> 15:18.145
YOU LOOK MORE LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY

15:18.180 --> 15:19.875
WHO WAS NAMED
AFTER HIS GRANDFATHER.

15:19.910 --> 15:25.542
I WAS NAMED AFTER
MY GREAT-UNCLE... OLIVER.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.956
AND ARE YOU A FAMILY MAN,
OLIVER?

15:27.990 --> 15:29.014
THREE GIRLS.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.379
THREE GIRLS?
MM-HMM.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.126
WOW. SO YOU MUST HAVE
YOUR HANDS FULL.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.525
YOU KNOW HAVE NO IDEA,
GISELLE.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.769
OOH, I AM THE OLDEST
OF FOUR GIRLS.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.358
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

15:40.400 --> 15:44.860
I, UH... WELL, I SHARE
THE LOAD WITH MY WIFE.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.108
ACTUALLY, MY WIFE DOES ALL
THE WORK, AND SHE KNOWS IT.

15:50.610 --> 15:51.975
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:52.010 --> 15:53.614
WHAT?

15:53.650 --> 15:56.642
WE'RE ALL JUST DOING
THE BEST WE CAN.

15:56.680 --> 16:00.355
SOMETIMES WE GET LUCKY,
AND THE... PEOPLE WE'RE WITH--

16:00.390 --> 16:02.779
THEY UNDERSTAND
AND SUPPORT THAT.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.588
WOW.

16:05.630 --> 16:06.824
YOU STILL GOT IT, WILLIAMS.

16:06.860 --> 16:07.827
MM-HMM.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.260
WOW.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.098
POINT IS, MAKE A CONNECTION.
MAKE IT REAL.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.438
GOT IT?

16:15.470 --> 16:18.507
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET
YOUR PICTURE TAKEN.

16:18.540 --> 16:19.962
(groans)

16:20.010 --> 16:21.534
(male dispatcher) 9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

16:21.580 --> 16:24.299
(elderly woman) I was at an
antique fair down in Caledon,

16:24.350 --> 16:29.014
and I saw that young lady who
was missing--Nicole Marshall?

16:29.050 --> 16:32.440
I'm positive it was her.
She was bidding on a trunk.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.855
They were calling it
a Jenny Lind,

16:33.890 --> 16:35.482
but there's no way
those buttons were brass.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.817
Can you describe the woman?

16:36.860 --> 16:39.579
(teakettle whistling)
Mm, she had red hair.

16:39.630 --> 16:42.451
Oh, one moment.
There goes my teakettle.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.799
WE'RE TAKING CALLS
FROM THE ANTIQUE ROADSHOW,

16:45.830 --> 16:48.162
AND GAIL'S GOING UNDERCOVER
WITH HER NEW BOYFRIEND.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.497
IT'S OKAY
IF YOU'RE NOT OVER HER.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.758
LOOK, JUST 'CAUSE
YOU'RE NOT OVER SUE,

16:51.810 --> 16:53.232
DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT
OVER GAIL.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.508
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT GIRL
IN YOUR BED EVERY WEEK.

16:54.540 --> 16:55.939
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
EVEN CHANGE THE SHEETS.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.208
ONLY WHEN
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.412
ALL I'M SAYING
IS IT'S OKAY.

17:00.450 --> 17:06.218
LOOK, SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO
BEAT QUALITY IS WITH QUANTITY.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.558
(taps key)

17:07.590 --> 17:10.320
OKAY, SO WE'RE ALL SET.

17:10.360 --> 17:13.818
NiceGuy76 LIKED MY PROFILE.
DINNER AT THE ARCHER, 10:00,

17:13.860 --> 17:15.418
AND HE EVEN BOOKED
THE PENTHOUSE SUITE.

17:15.460 --> 17:16.927
10:00 P.M.?
MM-HMM.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.394
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR A WARRANT,

17:19.430 --> 17:21.193
SO WE WON'T BE WIRED FOR AUDIO.

17:21.240 --> 17:25.836
THE BEST WE CAN DO
IS TAP INTO HOTEL CAMERAS.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.679
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA DO THIS
TONIGHT?

17:27.710 --> 17:29.302
IF HE WANTS TO MEET TONIGHT,
I'M READY.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.979
I MEAN, WHY WOULD WE GIVE HIM
A CHANCE TO RECONSIDER?

17:32.010 --> 17:33.238
LET'S DO IT.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.838
NOELLE?

17:34.880 --> 17:37.417
SHE SAYS SHE'S READY.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.878
OKAY.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.808
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT A COP.
YOU'RE AN ESCORT.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.521
YOU WON'T BE ARMED,
SO IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,

17:43.560 --> 17:46.256
SPRAY THIS IN HIS EYES
AND GET OUT OF THERE. GOT IT?

17:46.290 --> 17:48.099
UH-HUH.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.199
SURE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS?

17:49.230 --> 17:51.027
ABSOLUTELY.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.560
I CAN DO THIS.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.330
***

17:57.310 --> 18:00.234
(man) GUYS, I'M SORRY.
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.602
MY CLIENTS DO HAVE
AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.141
WE ONLY HAVE CAMERAS DOWN HERE.
THERE ARE NONE UPSTAIRS.

18:06.180 --> 18:09.479
YOU MUST GET A LOT OF THESE
LADIES COMING THROUGH HERE, HUH?

18:09.520 --> 18:11.738
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.678
COULD NEVER TELL
WHO THEY ARE.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.051
REALLY?

18:15.090 --> 18:16.614
LET ME HELP YOU.
THEY'RE DROP-DEAD.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.150
THEY ARRIVE ALONE.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.680
THEY LEAVE ALONE
A FEW HOURS LATER.

18:19.730 --> 18:21.197
THEY COME BACK
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.697
I MEAN, THERE'S THAT.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.028
THESE ARE THE GIRLS YOU GUYS
MAKE ALL YOUR MONEY ON.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.163
CAN'T ARREST TWO PEOPLE
FOR HAVING DINNER.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.691
AND WE'RE HARDLY GOING TO
FOLLOW THEM UP TO THEIR ROOMS.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.469
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME
YOUR SECURITY SETUP?

18:31.510 --> 18:33.034
YOU BET.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.538
GAVIN .

18:35.580 --> 18:37.707
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNOWS WE'RE HERE TONIGHT.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.172
OF COURSE.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.648
THIS'LL WORK.

18:46.090 --> 18:47.887
YEAH.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.821
YEAH. THIS'LL--
THIS'LL BE JUST FINE.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.658
(woman speaking indistinctly)

18:53.700 --> 18:54.849
HEY.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.855
HEY.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.322
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.361
THANK YOU. SO DO YOU.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.061
OKAY, SO A CAR'S GONNA
TAKE YOU TO THE ARCHER,

19:04.110 --> 19:06.328
YOU KNOW, SO YOU
MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

19:06.370 --> 19:08.008
JERRY WANTED ME
TO REMIND YOU

19:08.040 --> 19:09.632
THAT THERE HAS TO BE
AN EXCHANGE OF MONEY.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.001
SO AS SOON AS YOU GUYS
GET UP TO THE ROOM,

19:12.050 --> 19:13.574
YOU KNOW,
MAKE SURE HE PAYS YOU.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.575
OKAY.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.680
UH, WHEN HE DOES,

19:17.720 --> 19:19.244
YOU NEED TO CALL
ROOM SERVICE

19:19.290 --> 19:20.518
AND ORDER
A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE,

19:20.560 --> 19:22.050
'CAUSE THAT'S
THE SIGNAL FOR US.

19:22.090 --> 19:23.227
OKAY.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.227
ME AND NICK ARE GONNA BE
THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.329
WHEN YOU GUYS
ARE COMING UPSTAIRS,

19:25.360 --> 19:27.055
WE'RE GONNA BE
IN THE HALLWAY.

19:27.090 --> 19:28.626
I KNOW.
OKAY.

19:28.660 --> 19:31.128
(zips pouch)

19:31.170 --> 19:32.262
WHAT'S UP?

19:32.300 --> 19:33.733
JUST, I DON'T HAVE EARRINGS.

19:33.770 --> 19:36.295
OH. PFFT. TAKE MINE.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.739
HERE, SERIOUSLY.
THANK YOU.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.761
I DON'T NEED THEM. THEY'LL LOOK
BETTER ON YOU ANYWAY.

19:39.810 --> 19:40.777
_HERE.
(earrings clatter)

19:40.810 --> 19:43.472
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:43.510 --> 19:44.772
IT'S GONNA LOOK GREAT.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.971
PERFECT GIRLFRIEND MATERIAL?
HMM?
YEAH.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.272
HMM? HMM?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.709
ARE YOU NERVOUS?
IT'S OKAY.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.638
IT'S FINE. USE IT.
I MEAN, IT'S A FIRST DATE.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.157
YOU SHOULD BE NERVOUS.
YES.

19:54.190 --> 19:56.784
LOOK, THIS IS THE COOLEST PART
ABOUT BEING UNDERCOVER.
MM-HMM.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.959
THE MORE REAL YOU ARE,
THE MORE THEY'RE GONNA BUY IT.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.289
OKAY.
LOOK, THE CAR'S HERE,
SO I'M GONNA MEET YOU THERE.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.321
ALL RIGHT. (sighs)

20:09.470 --> 20:11.335
(horns honk in distance)

20:11.370 --> 20:14.373
(siren wailing in distance)

20:17.980 --> 20:19.242
THANK YOU.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.312
(indistinct conversations)

20:42.370 --> 20:43.837
(horn honks in distance)

20:48.740 --> 20:50.947
SHE'S ON HER WAY IN.

20:50.980 --> 20:56.771
***

21:01.560 --> 21:03.016
(lowered voice)
HERE WE GO.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.993
LET ME GUESS.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.190
APPLETINI.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.097
I DON'T LIKE FRUITY DRINKS.
TEQUILA.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.031
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY,
THE AGAVE IS A FRUIT PLANT.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.938
OH, IS THAT WHAT YOU DO?
YOU LECTURE PEOPLE ON ALCOHOL?

21:22.980 --> 21:25.198
ONLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.149
AREN'T YOU WORKING?

21:29.180 --> 21:30.272
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
REPORT ME?

21:30.320 --> 21:32.845
(bottle clatters)

21:35.560 --> 21:37.380
(glass clatters)
IS THAT YOUR TELL?

21:37.430 --> 21:40.354
WHAT?
YOU GET NERVOUS, YOU START
PLAYING WITH YOUR EARRING.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.824
THESE AREN'T EVEN MINE.
THEY'RE MY FRIEND'S.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.895
SHE LENT THEM TO ME 'CAUSE
I'M STAYING AT HER HOUSE

21:45.930 --> 21:47.898
BECAUSE MY PLACE
IS BEING RENOVATED,

21:47.940 --> 21:49.464
AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN
REALLY MY STYLE,

21:49.500 --> 21:51.536
BUT I MEAN,
I GUESS THEY'RE NICE, BUT...

21:51.570 --> 21:55.199
(laughs) I DON'T WHY
I'M TALKING SO MUCH.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.275
UH... (chuckles)

21:56.310 --> 21:58.403
BECAUSE HE'S LATE.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.182
HEY.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.108
THIS GUY STANDS YOU UP,

22:07.150 --> 22:09.015
YOU GOTTA DUMP HIM.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.357
SERIOUSLY.

22:10.390 --> 22:12.278
PROMISE ME?

22:12.330 --> 22:13.592
PROMISE.

22:13.630 --> 22:15.222
(clink)

22:15.260 --> 22:17.899
(siren wailing in distance)

22:17.930 --> 22:20.967
WHAT IF
HE DOESN'T SHOW?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.264
HE'LL SHOW.
HE'S A ROMANTIC.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.109
PAYING FOR SEX
IS ROMANTIC?

22:25.140 --> 22:28.029
HE'S NOT PAYING FOR SEX.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.399
HE'S PAYING TO HAVE PECK
LOOK AT HIM

22:29.440 --> 22:32.147
LIKE HE'S EVERYTHING
SHE COULD EVER WANT IN A MAN.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.845
JERRY...

22:36.880 --> 22:38.882
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT YOU ARE EVERYTHING

22:38.920 --> 22:40.717
I COULD EVER WANT IN A MAN.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.115
YEAH. I KNOW. I GET IT.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.753
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE BOATS.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.894
(scoffs)

22:48.930 --> 22:50.591
JERRY.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.222
OKAY.

22:52.270 --> 22:53.225
HI.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.828
HI. CHARLIE DAVIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:54.870 --> 22:55.939
HI.
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

22:55.970 --> 22:57.506
UM, CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

22:57.540 --> 23:00.532
I--ACTUALLY, I'VE
ALREADY GOT ONE.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.639
(glass clatters)

23:02.680 --> 23:04.773
I WOULD LOVE
ANOTHER ONE, THOUGH.

23:04.810 --> 23:05.970
ARE YOU OKAY?

23:06.010 --> 23:07.910
(giggles) YEAH.
UH, APPLETINI?

23:07.950 --> 23:10.510
UH, APPLETINI
AND A CRANBERRY JUICE, PLEASE.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.415
***

23:12.450 --> 23:14.509
SO, JASMINE,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.915
YOU'RE NOT WHAT
I WAS EXPECTING.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.179
OH. RACHEL SAID THAT YOU
WANTED TO MEET SOMEONE NEW.

23:20.230 --> 23:21.788
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NERVOUS.
I'M NOT GONNA BITE.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.494
SO WHY DO YOU DO THIS?

23:26.730 --> 23:28.231
WHY NOT?

23:28.270 --> 23:30.329
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

23:30.370 --> 23:33.237
BACK IN COLLEGE,
A GIRL LIKE YOU

23:33.270 --> 23:35.738
WOULDN'T GIVE ME TIME OF DAY,
AND NOW I MAKE YOU NERVOUS.

23:37.480 --> 23:40.142
HEY, NO, NO.
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

23:40.180 --> 23:43.308
REALLY, I MEAN,
YOU'RE--YOU'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

23:43.350 --> 23:46.649
THAT MADE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE,
THOUGH. WHY?

23:46.690 --> 23:48.487
I... DON'T KNOW.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.353
WELL, EITHER YOU DISAGREE,

23:51.390 --> 23:53.153
WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE VERY INSECURE,

23:53.190 --> 23:55.522
OR... YOU KNOW
IT'S THE TRUTH,

23:55.560 --> 23:57.994
BUT YOU THINK IT'S SOCIALLY
UNACCEPTABLE TO ADMIT IT.

23:58.030 --> 24:00.328
I-I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

24:00.370 --> 24:02.861
I'M JUST FASCINATED TO KNOW
WHY A WOMAN LIKE YOU

24:02.900 --> 24:05.039
WOULD WANNA BE SEEN
WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.538
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S DEEPLY INSECURE.

24:11.210 --> 24:13.144
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.

24:14.380 --> 24:15.972
(man) so WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE SOME MENUS?

24:16.020 --> 24:18.238
HEY, YEAH, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.918
***

24:22.620 --> 24:24.781
(female dispatcher) 9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

24:24.830 --> 24:28.095
(elderly man) Yes, hello.
My name is Clarence Dodgson.

24:28.130 --> 24:31.167
Can you put me through to
the Lost and Found Department?

24:31.200 --> 24:34.169
OH, SERIOUSLY, KILL ME. SHOOT ME
IN THE FACE WITH YOUR GUN.
Well, I don't know.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.704
I found this necklace
while I was out walking.

24:37.740 --> 24:40.800
It's gold and has
a heart-shaped locked.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.933
The person who dropped it
must be very upset.

24:42.980 --> 24:45.278
LOOK... (stammers)

24:45.310 --> 24:48.143
NOBODY CALLS IN
TO REPORT LOST AND FOUND.

24:48.180 --> 24:49.772
OKAY, JUST--JUST SKIP IT.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.811
NO. OLIVER SAID WE GOTTA
LISTEN TO ALL OF 'EM

24:51.850 --> 24:52.919
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.508
THIS IS ABOUT AS BAD
AS THE THREE PEOPLE

24:54.560 --> 24:58.382
THAT CALLED 9-1-1
OVER PIZZAS.

24:58.430 --> 25:01.854
IT'S NOTHIN'. JUST SKIP IT.
(taps key)

25:01.900 --> 25:04.289
Sir, if there's no emergency,
I have to clear the line.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.195
Well,
I found it on the ground

25:06.230 --> 25:07.959
while I was
walking my dog Atticus

25:08.000 --> 25:09.297
by Moore Park.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.104
And there's an inscription.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.779
Just a moment.
Let me get my other glasses.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.475
Yes, that's better.
It says "Nicole."

25:20.510 --> 25:23.809
It looks to me like a keepsake,
so I wanted to call it in.

25:23.850 --> 25:26.614
(taps key)

25:27.820 --> 25:30.118
GOLD HEART-SHAPED NECKLACE.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.253
THAT'S NOT NOTHIN'.

25:42.970 --> 25:45.200
I STARTED THE BUSINESS
IN MY PARENTS' BASEMENT,

25:45.240 --> 25:48.038
AND, UM, I HAD NO IDEA
IT WOULD GO SO BIG SO FAST.

25:48.080 --> 25:52.676
AND IT'S WEIRD BEING IN CHARGE
OF 200 PEOPLE,

25:52.710 --> 25:53.938
MOSTLY 'CAUSE
THEY WANT ME TO--

25:53.980 --> 25:55.242
THEY EXPECT ME TO ACT
A CERTAIN WAY,

25:55.280 --> 25:59.979
LIKE... TOUGH, DECISIVE,
NO FEAR.

26:00.020 --> 26:02.818
IT'S NOT WHO I AM.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.521
KIND OF WHO THEY NEED ME
TO BE.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.959
YEAH, MY FRIENDS
ARE LIKE THAT.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.197
SORT OF SEE ME
THIS ONE WAY,

26:08.230 --> 26:09.993
NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.123
AND THE WEIRD THING IS,
IT'S SORT OF GETTING EASIER

26:12.170 --> 26:15.264
FOR ME TO BE THAT PERSON.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.860
WELL... I MUST BE
GETTING GOOD AT IT.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.798
(chuckles)

26:19.840 --> 26:21.569
YOU WANNA GET OUT OF HERE?

26:24.350 --> 26:25.601
YEAH, SURE.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.310
HEY, CAN I HAVE THE, UM,
CAN I HAVE THE BILL, PLEASE?

26:32.120 --> 26:35.180
(cell phone beeps)

26:35.220 --> 26:38.986
(indistinct conversations)

26:39.030 --> 26:40.327
(Charlie) THANK YOU.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.160
(button clicks)

26:52.210 --> 26:54.872
(speaks inaudibly)

26:58.450 --> 27:00.008

doors Open)

27:03.690 --> 27:05.510
(elevator doors close)

27:05.550 --> 27:08.212
SO, UH, WHAT FLOOR
ARE YOU ON?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.785
I AM IN THE PENTHOUSE.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.457
(button clicks)

27:13.930 --> 27:16.797
BUT... I THOUGHT WE'D GO
FOR A LITTLE RIDE FIRST.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.127
(button clicks)

27:20.970 --> 27:22.130
(beep)

27:24.170 --> 27:26.263
McNALLY,
THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.579
(elevator doors close)

27:37.220 --> 27:39.211
(elevator doors open)

27:42.920 --> 27:46.287
(elevator bell dings,
doors Open)

27:50.560 --> 27:52.494
(receiver clatters)

27:54.170 --> 27:55.694
(cell phone rings)

27:55.740 --> 27:57.264
(beep)

27:57.300 --> 27:58.733
YEAH.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.829
HEY, LISTEN, NOBODY'S IN
THE ELEVATOR. WHERE ARE THEY?

28:00.880 --> 28:03.075
WHAT? HOLD ON.

28:03.110 --> 28:04.145
(beep)

28:04.180 --> 28:05.374
SAM, YOU GOT A VISUAL?

28:05.410 --> 28:07.605
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THEY JUST WENT IN THE ELEVATOR.

28:07.650 --> 28:09.345
THEY'RE NOT UPSTAIRS?

28:11.590 --> 28:13.911
ALL RIGHT, HANG ON.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.118
WHERE ARE THEY?

28:18.260 --> 28:20.182
WHERE ARE THEY?

28:20.230 --> 28:21.197
WHERE ARE THEY?

28:21.230 --> 28:25.018
(pounding keys)

28:26.270 --> 28:28.636
***

28:28.670 --> 28:32.060
(siren wailing in distance)

28:32.110 --> 28:35.500
OKAY, COME ON. COME ON.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.044
GOT HER. THERE.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.581

28:44.620 --> 28:47.953
SO I GUESS THIS IS, UH, P3?

28:47.990 --> 28:49.719
SORRY. I ALWAYS GET LOST
IN THESE THINGS.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.921
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW WHERE I PARKED.

28:53.430 --> 28:54.829
SMART GIRL.

28:54.860 --> 28:59.126
OKAY, GUYS, THEY'RE IN
THE PARKING GARAGE, THIRD LEVEL.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.262
OKAY.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.528
(button clicks)
LEVEL 3. THE GARAGE.

29:01.570 --> 29:03.094
(button clicks)

29:03.140 --> 29:04.732
(sighs)

29:04.770 --> 29:07.603
WE'LL TAKE THE STAIRS.
IT'LL BE FASTER.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.073
HAD TO BE THE PENTHOUSE.

29:11.810 --> 29:14.210
(sighs and sniffles)

29:16.680 --> 29:18.386
(opens car door)

29:18.420 --> 29:19.387
LADIES FIRST.

29:19.420 --> 29:21.354
HEY, SO, LISTEN, UM,

29:25.830 --> 29:27.821
YEAH. NO, OF COURSE.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.953
I MEAN, THAT'S ALWAYS
AN AWKWARD MOMENT, RIGHT?

29:30.000 --> 29:33.663
NO, NOT AT ALL. UM...
LET'S GET IN THE CAR FIRST.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.861

29:53.090 --> 29:55.058
THANK YOU.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.615
IT'S OKAY.
I'M SURE YOU'RE WORTH IT.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.949
NOW WE CAN JUST RELAX.
BE OURSELVES.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.491
UM, SO WHERE ARE WE GOING?

30:07.170 --> 30:08.637

YOU'LL SEE.

30:08.670 --> 30:10.331
YEAH, IT'S JUST,

30:10.370 --> 30:12.167

WELL,

30:14.410 --> 30:17.129
I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.501
I TOLD YOU.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.976
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.685
IT'S TIME YOU LEARNED
TO DO WHAT I TELL YOU.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.009
(loud knock on window)

30:30.060 --> 30:32.949
NiceGuy. NiceGuy76.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.992
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

30:35.030 --> 30:36.520
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.754
WHAT THE...

30:39.600 --> 30:41.465
GET OVER HERE.
GET OFF!

30:41.500 --> 30:42.467
AAH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HUH?

30:42.500 --> 30:43.797
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

30:43.840 --> 30:46.263
YOU GOT A NAME?
CHARLIE DAVIS.

30:46.310 --> 30:48.437
CHARLIE DAVIS, YOU'RE UNDER
ARREST FOR SOLICITATION.
(handcuffs clicking)

30:48.480 --> 30:49.435
WHAT?!

30:49.480 --> 30:52.938

YEAH, I'M FINE.

30:52.980 --> 30:54.049
WHAT ARE YOU, A COP?

30:54.080 --> 30:55.968
I'M SORRY.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.045
SO ALL THAT STUFF THAT WAS
SAID IN THERE--WHAT WAS THAT?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.285
SHUT UP.
GET OFF OF ME!
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

31:00.320 --> 31:02.117
OH, YEAH?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.855
DO THE NAMES LIZ ADAMS
AND NICOLE MARSHALL

31:03.890 --> 31:06.688

31:06.730 --> 31:09.597
OR MAYBE YOU KNOW THEM
AS AMBER AND VALENTINA?

31:09.630 --> 31:13.669
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. (panting)

31:13.700 --> 31:14.894
(grunts)

31:14.940 --> 31:15.964
ARE YOU OKAY?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.399
YEAH, I'M FINE.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.908
OKAY. McNALLY'S GONNA
STAY WITH YOU.

31:21.940 --> 31:23.430
AND THEN YOU CAN GO HOME,

31:23.480 --> 31:25.072
OKAY.

31:25.110 --> 31:26.077
PECK.

YOU DID GOOD.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.116
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TALK WITH THIS GUY.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.650
COME ON, BUDDY.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.426
(siren wailing)

31:39.460 --> 31:41.826
(door beeps and buzzes)

31:41.860 --> 31:44.727
(cell phone beeps)

31:44.770 --> 31:45.794
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD THIS
FOR A WHILE.

31:45.830 --> 31:48.697
I STILL CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

31:48.740 --> 31:49.832
YOU MUST BE GOOD WITH THIS.

31:49.870 --> 31:51.360
YOU'RE A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER,
RIGHT?

31:52.610 --> 31:55.374
YEAH, I BET YOU KNOW YOUR WAY
AROUND THE INTERNET,

31:55.410 --> 31:58.675
HOW TO BE UNTRACEABLE...

31:58.710 --> 32:01.178
INVISIBLE.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.346
VVELL".
(beep)

32:02.380 --> 32:07.044
WELL, MODERN TECHNOLOGY.
IT IS AMAZING.

32:07.090 --> 32:08.580
(sniffs)

32:09.720 --> 32:14.089
YOU'RE STILL HUMAN, THOUGH,
AREN'T YOU, CHARLIE, HMM?

32:14.130 --> 32:16.257
FUNNY THING ABOUT PEOPLE--

32:16.300 --> 32:19.098
THEY'RE CREATURES OF HABIT.

32:19.130 --> 32:24.158
LIKE YOUR THING, APPARENTLY,
IS BLONDES.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.930
LIZ ADAMS.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.471
NICOLE MARSHALL.

32:32.810 --> 32:35.074
(filtered voice)
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, CHARLIE.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.816
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE. HMM?

32:39.820 --> 32:41.356
SO LET'S START WITH LIZ.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.827
YOU WERE WITH HER
LAST MONDAY NIGHT, RIGHT?

32:46.060 --> 32:48.893
YES, I WAS.
WE HAD DINNER,

32:48.930 --> 32:50.750
AND THEN WE WENT
TO MY HOTEL ROOM,

32:50.800 --> 32:53.826
AND THEN I WENT TO THE MERCURY
UNTIL 3:00 AM.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.167
(filtered voice) YOU CAN
CHECK MY CREDIT CARD.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.408
I SPENT LIKE $800.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.329
(cell phone rings)

33:01.380 --> 33:02.335
(sighs)

33:02.380 --> 33:03.972
(ring, beep)

33:04.010 --> 33:05.671
YEAH?

33:05.710 --> 33:09.714
(police radio chatter)

33:09.750 --> 33:11.217
WHAT'S UP?

33:11.250 --> 33:13.241
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.
WHAT?

33:13.290 --> 33:15.884
GUESS WHO JUST WALKED IN.
WHO?

33:15.920 --> 33:18.650
MEET LIZ ADAMS.

33:18.690 --> 33:23.195
LIZ. WE'RE VERY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

33:23.230 --> 33:24.424
WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:24.470 --> 33:27.428
YOUR BOYFRIEND FILED
A MISSING PERSONS REPORT.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.791
HE REPORTED ME MISSING?

33:29.840 --> 33:31.262
WHY?

33:31.310 --> 33:33.266
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL WEEK?

33:33.310 --> 33:35.175
I WENT TO A B&B
IN NIAGARA.

33:35.210 --> 33:36.404
WHY WAS YOUR PHONE OFF?

33:36.440 --> 33:38.146
DREW AND I HAD A FIGHT.

33:38.180 --> 33:40.501
I NEEDED A LITTLE TIME
TO MYSELF.

33:40.550 --> 33:42.142
OKAY.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.477
DID YOUR JOHN DO THAT?

33:43.520 --> 33:45.340
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:45.390 --> 33:46.482
WE TALKED TO RACHEL FINDLAY,
LIZ.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.351
WE KNOW
ABOUT ELITE COMPANIONS.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.388
(sighs) COULD YOU COME
WITH ME, PLEASE?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.891
(door buzzes and beeps)

34:03.700 --> 34:04.962
(door closes)

34:05.010 --> 34:06.329
DO YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

34:09.210 --> 34:10.404
LIZ?

34:10.440 --> 34:11.873
WE'RE NOT GONNA ARREST YOU.

34:11.910 --> 34:14.344
WE JUST NEED
SOME INFORMATION, OKAY?

34:17.420 --> 34:18.387
IT'S CHARLIE.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.944
(speaking inaudibly)

34:19.990 --> 34:21.719
HE'S ONE OF MY WEEKLIES.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.252
RIGHT. CAN YOU CONFIRM YOU WERE
WITH HIM ON MONDAY NIGHT?

34:25.290 --> 34:26.757
YES.

34:26.790 --> 34:29.998
LIZ,
WITH THESE TYPES OF JOHNS,

34:30.030 --> 34:33.568
THE BEHAVIOR ALWAYS ESCALATES.
IT STARTS WITH A BLACK EYE,

34:33.600 --> 34:35.636
AND THEN IT'S SOMETHING
A LOT WORSE.

34:35.670 --> 34:38.264
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

34:38.310 --> 34:40.938
CHARLIE DIDN'T HIT ME.

34:40.970 --> 34:42.779
IT WAS DREW.

34:42.810 --> 34:45.472
IT WAS MY BOYFRIEND.

34:45.510 --> 34:48.343
***

34:50.250 --> 34:51.945
(door beeps)

34:51.990 --> 34:53.218
(man) THANK YOU.
(telephone rings)

34:53.250 --> 34:54.786
(Chris) SO, MR. DODGSON...
DIVISION 15.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.811
YOU CALLED 9-1-1 LAST MONTH
ABOUT A NECKLACE?

34:56.860 --> 34:59.988
Y-YES.
I-I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

35:00.030 --> 35:03.090
I'D ALMOST, UH, FORGOTTEN IT,
UH, UNTIL YOU CALLED.

35:03.130 --> 35:04.688
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU FOUND IT?

35:04.730 --> 35:06.493
ATTICUS AND I DO OUR WALKING
IN MOORE PARK.

35:06.530 --> 35:09.397
I FOUND IT BY THE BACK.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.429
WHERE EXACTLY?

35:10.470 --> 35:14.702
ABOUT 30 FEET
PAST A BLUE SHED,

35:14.740 --> 35:17.208
THERE'S A FALLEN TREE.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.209
I FOUND IT RIGHT THERE,
O-ON THE PATH BY THE TREE.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.218
(lowered voice) MOORE PARK--
COULD BE POTENTIAL DUMP SITE.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.342
(lowered voice) YEAH, YEAH,
LET'S CUT HIM LOOSE

35:23.380 --> 35:26.315
AND CHECK IT OUT.

35:26.350 --> 35:28.682
UM, UH, THANK YOU.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.848
YEAH. THANK YOU.
(Chuckles)

35:31.890 --> 35:34.893
(telephone ringing)

35:36.730 --> 35:38.721
CHARLIE'S ALIBI CHECKED OUT.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.295
I KICKED HIM
ON A PROMISE TO APPEAR.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.296
HE'S A FREE MAN.

35:43.340 --> 35:44.329
GREAT.

35:44.370 --> 35:45.337
YEAH, WELL,
ACCORDING TO LIZ,

35:45.370 --> 35:46.701
IT WAS HER BOYFRIEND
WHO HIT HER

35:46.740 --> 35:48.708
AFTER HE FOUND OUT WHAT
SHE WAS DOING FOR A LIVING.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.435
THAT'S WHY SHE LEFT TOWN.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.549
YOU THINK SHE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH?

35:51.580 --> 35:53.275
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE?

35:53.310 --> 35:54.413
YOU KNOW, OR MAYBE
SHE'S PROTECTING THE JOHN.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.111
I SUPPOSE
THAT'S GOOD BUSINESS.

35:56.150 --> 35:58.846
YOU KNOW,
BUT CHARLIE GOES HOME,

35:58.890 --> 36:00.289
AND HE GETS RID
OF ANY EVIDENCE

36:00.320 --> 36:04.882
THAT COULD TIE HIM
TO NICOLE'S DISAPPEARANCE.

36:06.630 --> 36:08.393
WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.628
HEY.

36:13.670 --> 36:16.138
HEARD YOU'RE NOT
COMING TO MY WEDDING.

36:16.170 --> 36:18.434
WHAT? WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

36:18.470 --> 36:20.301
IT'S THE WORD
ON THE STREET.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.331
(scoffs)

36:22.380 --> 36:25.440
IT'S TOO BAD 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE MY BEST MAN.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.719
THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.241
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS
THE THING WITH THE BEST MAN--

36:32.290 --> 36:35.782
HE USUALLY COMES
TO THE WEDDING.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.287
(sighs)

36:37.320 --> 36:39.880
COULDN'T JUST HAVE IT
AT CITY HALL, HUH?

36:41.160 --> 36:44.095
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T
YOU JUST TELL ANDY THE TRUTH?

36:44.130 --> 36:46.860
IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL.
SO YOU'RE AFRAID OF FLYING.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.128
I NEVER SAID THAT.

36:48.170 --> 36:49.933
I JUST HATE TAKING MY BOOTS
OFF AT THE AIRPORT.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.335
OKAY.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.044
WHAT'S WEIRD IS THAT
I WAS MORE HONEST WITH THAT GUY

37:03.080 --> 37:05.947
THAN I HAVE BEEN WITH ANYONE
IN, LIKE, A REALLY LONG TIME.

37:05.990 --> 37:09.016
YEAH, AND YOU DID GREAT.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.812
SAM'S GONNA ACTUALLY
PICK ME UP.

37:10.860 --> 37:12.885
UM, I'M GONNA STAY
AT HIS PLACE TONIGHT.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.023
OH, GREAT. NOW I HAVE
THAT VISUAL IN MY HEAD.

37:15.060 --> 37:17.494
(Chuckles) I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
IF YOU WANTED A RIDE HOME.

37:17.530 --> 37:18.690
NO, I THINK I'M--I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA GET A CAB

37:18.730 --> 37:20.027
BACK TO YOUR PLACE.

37:20.070 --> 37:23.039
HEY, ARE YOU, UH,
ARE YOU FREE?
WHERE TO?

37:23.070 --> 37:24.958
I'M GONNA GO TO QUEEN
AND CARLISLE IN LESLIEVILLE.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.466
YEAH.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.899
(horn honks in distance)

37:28.940 --> 37:31.033
LISTEN, GAIL, IF--
IF YOU DON'T,

37:31.080 --> 37:33.048
YOU KNOW, WANNA BE ALONE
TONIGHT, I GET IT.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.377
I'M OKAY. I'M GOOD.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.479
I'M JUST--I'M JUST TIRED.
(car doors Close)

37:36.520 --> 37:38.715
AND IT'S GONNA BE REALLY NICE
HAVING THE PLACE TO MYSELF.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.479
(car engine starts)
OKAY. YOU HAVE YOUR KEY?

37:40.520 --> 37:41.487
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.657
SEE YA LATER.

37:42.690 --> 37:43.952
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
BYE.

37:43.990 --> 37:46.220
BYE.

37:46.260 --> 37:48.399
(Closes car door)

37:48.430 --> 37:50.398
(car departs)

37:50.430 --> 37:52.489
(sighs) THANK YOU.

37:52.530 --> 37:53.895
(cell phone beeps)

37:53.930 --> 37:56.967
(radio chatter)

37:57.000 --> 37:58.968
UH, HEY, IT'S ME.

37:59.010 --> 38:03.379
UM... SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M ON MY OWN TONIGHT,

38:03.410 --> 38:08.109
AND I'M AT ANDY'S, AND I WAS
JUST SORT OF THINKING MAYBE, UH,

38:08.150 --> 38:10.448
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.539
AND H KNOW IT'S BEEN
A REALLY LONG DAY,
