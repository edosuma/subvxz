WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:04.733
No. No, no!
Don't touch that dial.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.733
You're in Springwood now.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.733
But you are all mine.

01:03.066 --> 01:06.133
'So how about blue walls

01:03.066 --> 01:06.133
and gray carpeting?'

01:06.200 --> 01:07.766
Ooh, or, uh..

01:07.833 --> 01:09.866
...gray walls
with rose gold carpeting?

01:09.933 --> 01:11.633
What do you think?

01:11.700 --> 01:14.266
Whatever you want.
You're the designer.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.933
I don't know!

01:16.000 --> 01:19.066
I guess it'll depend on
what color furniture we want.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.933
So what color furniture
do we want?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.066
Green...with orange walls

01:23.133 --> 01:24.633
and purple carpeting.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.133
Oh, you're in a good mood

01:27.200 --> 01:29.000
for someone
who's been driving all night.

01:29.066 --> 01:31.800
I feel so much better
moving to a small town.

01:32.566 --> 01:34.900
No more stress.

01:34.966 --> 01:36.933
I even stopped taking
my medication.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Does Dr. Manson know?

01:39.066 --> 01:41.700
Doug, I'm not gonna need it now.
I'm fine.

01:41.766 --> 01:44.100
Of course you're fine.
It's because of your medication.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.100
I have plenty of pills
packed with the movers

01:46.166 --> 01:47.433
and I have some with me
just in case.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.533
But the point is
...I'm calm now.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.100
I'm so happy.

01:52.900 --> 01:56.300
You know what? So am I.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.000
This is a new beginning
for us, Doug.

01:59.066 --> 02:00.066
You're gonna be
the best criminal lawyer

02:00.133 --> 02:01.300
this town's ever seen.

02:01.366 --> 02:02.833
And no more moving.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.633
I want this to be home.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.300
You got it.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.833
I'm so excited.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.366
I just lo-o-ove
having new neighbors.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.966
And I'm sure they're
just as thrilled to find out

02:24.033 --> 02:26.100
that I am
their welcoming committee.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.966
I guess you could say

02:28.033 --> 02:30.500
they're about to discover
that marriage..

02:30.566 --> 02:33.966
...can be
a moving experience. Hmm?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.000
I'm sorry
we have to do it this way.

02:49.066 --> 02:50.833
I'm just gonna check in
and meet the bigwig--

02:50.900 --> 02:53.266
Doug, it's okay.
That's why I drove.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.300
No, it's not okay.

02:56.533 --> 02:59.833
I didn't help you pack the house
and I feel guilty.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.766
Well, you are guilty.
But it's okay.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.266
'I'll be back as soon as I can.'

03:03.333 --> 03:05.533
That's a promise.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.366
Rox, I want this to work.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.366
Is that what you told
your other wives?

03:09.433 --> 03:10.733
Third time's a charm.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.600
Oh, it better be.

03:12.666 --> 03:14.100
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:46.966 --> 03:48.566
They don't work.

03:48.633 --> 03:50.033
Who's there?

03:52.133 --> 03:53.666
It's about time.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.833
I don't like to be kept waiting.

03:57.266 --> 03:59.900
My husband's gonna be here
in a few minutes.

03:59.966 --> 04:02.000
I'm sure he will.

04:03.566 --> 04:05.833
Meantime..

04:05.900 --> 04:08.600
...there's something
I need you to do for me, honey.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.100
Real bad.

04:12.433 --> 04:14.400
Sign this receipt.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.400
It's been a pleasure, Rox.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.200
These aren't my boxes!

06:13.933 --> 06:15.466
Okay, okay.
So they're not our things.

06:15.533 --> 06:18.433
Just leave 'em alone. We'll let
the movers take care of it.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.333
Don't stress
yourself out, Roxanne.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.166
Doug, there's blood
all over this stuff.

06:22.233 --> 06:24.766
Real blood.
I'm calling the police.

06:24.833 --> 06:26.866
'Now, how do you know
it's real blood?'

06:26.933 --> 06:28.033
It looks like it!

06:28.100 --> 06:30.133
Maybe the guy's a hunter.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.466
'Have you ever
thought about that?'

06:31.533 --> 06:33.166
What about the books
and the magazines

06:33.233 --> 06:34.533
and the clothes?

06:34.600 --> 06:36.633
Being weird
is no crime, Roxanne.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.800
I won a lot of cases
on that premise.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.300
Well, I want our stuff.

06:41.366 --> 06:43.700
I want my clothes, my jewelry.

06:43.766 --> 06:46.166
Okay. Okay. Just don't
go through anything else.

06:46.233 --> 06:47.600
It's not our stuff, right?

06:47.666 --> 06:49.333
I will call the movers right now

06:49.400 --> 06:51.133
and have them straighten
the whole mess out.

06:51.966 --> 06:53.866
'Now, you just relax, okay?'

06:53.933 --> 06:55.133
Okay.

07:47.533 --> 07:48.800
Who are you?

07:51.333 --> 07:52.833
How did you get in?

07:52.900 --> 07:56.600
I've been through your things.

07:58.566 --> 07:59.833
I know..

07:59.900 --> 08:02.800
...all there is
to know about you.

08:02.866 --> 08:04.300
I bet..

08:04.366 --> 08:06.466
...your husband..

08:06.533 --> 08:07.933
...loves you in these.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.200
What's it like being crazy?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.833
I'm not crazy.

08:24.233 --> 08:25.200
Then what are these?

08:26.866 --> 08:29.066
How did you..

08:29.133 --> 08:30.666
Our things are at your house?

08:30.733 --> 08:33.433
And you've got some of mine!

08:33.500 --> 08:35.300
The movers are coming
to make the switch.

08:35.366 --> 08:36.700
Did you look?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.366
- Did you look?
- No, I didn't look!

08:38.433 --> 08:39.766
- In the boxes?
- I didn't.

08:39.833 --> 08:43.166
I wouldn't look in the boxes.
That's not my stuff!

08:43.233 --> 08:46.300
A-ah, I-I need to know..

08:46.366 --> 08:48.100
...what you know.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.900
I don't know anything.

08:54.966 --> 08:57.300
I think you do!

08:59.066 --> 09:02.066
I think..

09:02.133 --> 09:03.633
...that you..

09:03.700 --> 09:04.800
...know..

09:05.533 --> 09:06.733
...everything.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.766
- 'Rox?'
- Yes, yes!

09:28.833 --> 09:30.633
'Listen, I called the movers.'

09:30.700 --> 09:31.900
Doug, he was here. I saw him.

09:31.966 --> 09:33.033
He went through our things!

09:33.100 --> 09:35.133
Who? Who-who broke into
our things?

09:37.566 --> 09:38.866
Um..

09:38.933 --> 09:40.833
No one. No one. I..

09:40.900 --> 09:42.400
I must have dozed.

09:45.233 --> 09:46.733
Do you have any pills left?

09:47.666 --> 09:49.466
Yes, plenty. I'm fine.

09:49.533 --> 09:50.833
Um..

09:50.900 --> 09:51.900
What did the movers say?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.366
They apologized profusely.

09:53.433 --> 09:56.066
It was a...mix up
with the trucks or something.

09:56.133 --> 09:58.233
They promised to send
someone out tomorrow morning.

09:58.300 --> 10:01.033
Tomorrow? No.
They have to come today.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.933
'Rox, I tried.
All the men have gone home!'

10:04.000 --> 10:06.733
Listen.
I've got an idea.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.100
Why don't we go out tonight?

10:08.166 --> 10:09.833
An early dinner?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.366
'Will that make you
feel better?'

10:12.433 --> 10:14.633
No! I don't want to go out.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.300
This is my home.

10:19.366 --> 10:21.533
Oh, what about
your pots and pans?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.066
I don't need them.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.800
I need you.
So come home soon, okay?

10:26.833 --> 10:28.333
As soon as I can.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.633
Okay.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.366
Candles?

11:08.433 --> 11:10.100
Very romantic.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.933
I'm touched.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.266
What are you doing here?

11:13.333 --> 11:15.566
My husband said you weren't
coming until tomorrow.

11:16.633 --> 11:18.633
I forgot to give you these

11:21.166 --> 11:23.300
How convenient.

11:23.366 --> 11:24.333
Yeah.

11:25.466 --> 11:27.433
I thought maybe we could talk.

11:29.266 --> 11:32.033
I mean, here you are,
new in town.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.800
And here I am, a native.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.666
I could show you around.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.100
I'm married.

11:41.433 --> 11:44.233
Well, I won't hold that
against you.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.633
Look, if you're not here
to move boxes, you can leave.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.433
How about letting me move you?

11:50.500 --> 11:51.833
Get out!

12:43.200 --> 12:44.533
Doug?

12:46.466 --> 12:47.700
Doug?

13:15.566 --> 13:16.566
Comfortable?

13:21.433 --> 13:24.733
Since you're so curious about me

13:24.800 --> 13:27.733
I thought I'd give you
a little demonstration.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.100
'You did look, didn't you?'

13:31.166 --> 13:33.800
- This is a dream.
- 'Is it?'

13:33.866 --> 13:36.200
All I have to do is wake up
and you'll be gone.

13:36.266 --> 13:38.800
What if you're wrong?

13:43.500 --> 13:45.566
'Who are you?'

13:45.633 --> 13:48.133
You've seen my handiwork.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.966
'You've been
thinking about it all day.'

13:51.033 --> 13:53.300
'Did he cut them?'

13:53.366 --> 13:56.233
'Did he...slice them in two?'

13:57.466 --> 14:00.400
Did they suffer..

14:00.466 --> 14:01.633
...much?

14:02.933 --> 14:05.400
You can scream if you like.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.600
I like it,
when they scream.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.666
No, you don't understand.

15:22.733 --> 15:24.566
You have no idea
what I've been through today.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.500
And I want that stuff
out of my house!

15:26.566 --> 15:29.633
I want my things,
and I want them now!

15:29.700 --> 15:32.433
I don't care
if they've gone home!

15:32.500 --> 15:33.666
Look.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.066
Do you even know
where my stuff is?

15:35.133 --> 15:37.800
You've lost it. That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

15:37.866 --> 15:39.300
Oh, you do have it?

15:39.366 --> 15:40.533
Where?

15:41.533 --> 15:43.333
I want you,
are you listening to me

15:43.400 --> 15:45.800
to send a truck
over here immediately.

15:46.733 --> 15:48.366
You can't?

15:48.433 --> 15:50.400
Okay, just give me the address.

15:51.566 --> 15:53.000
Fine.

15:53.066 --> 15:54.200
Fine.

15:55.966 --> 15:57.500
Fine, fine!

16:00.033 --> 16:01.933
Your secretary said you'd
call right back. Where were you?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.566
At the courthouse,
talking with the DA.

16:03.633 --> 16:05.533
Roxanne, what the hell
is going on?

16:05.600 --> 16:07.866
He was in the house.
He broke in and took his toys!

16:07.933 --> 16:09.100
Who broke in?
What are you talking about

16:09.166 --> 16:11.133
The man! I know what he did!

16:11.200 --> 16:13.066
- Are you alright?
- He cut them.

16:13.133 --> 16:15.300
The dresses,
they belonged to his victims.

16:15.366 --> 16:16.500
Roxanne, please.

16:16.566 --> 16:18.400
Doug, he tried to kill me!

16:18.466 --> 16:20.833
He's killed before,
he'll kill again! He likes it.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.833
- He likes it?
- Yes.

16:25.666 --> 16:27.733
Here. Maybe you're right.

16:28.766 --> 16:30.666
You believe me then?

16:30.733 --> 16:33.400
Or maybe it's all in your mind.

16:33.466 --> 16:35.833
Roxanne, you know what happens
when you go off of these things.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.466
You get a panic attack.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.800
Listen. I want you to go back
on your medication.

16:41.866 --> 16:43.233
I called Dr. Manson.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.433
He phoned your prescription
in to the Springwood pharmacy.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.400
I don't need a pill!

16:47.466 --> 16:49.300
This isn't stress, this is real!

16:49.366 --> 16:50.933
Roxanne, please take it.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.100
You're beginning to scare me.

16:52.166 --> 16:53.266
I bet, if we went to his house

16:53.333 --> 16:55.633
and you saw the knives,
you'd believe me!

16:55.700 --> 16:57.866
I've called the movers.
I know where he lives.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.966
I'll go there myself.
You can't babysit me forever.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.833
Alright. Alright, you win.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.833
I will take you
to the murderer's house!

17:03.900 --> 17:06.400
But please, take the pill first.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.400
'And try to relax.'

17:19.533 --> 17:20.966
Well, there must be a back door.
Let's try that.

17:21.033 --> 17:22.766
Rox, no. Don't.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.200
I'll do that.
Just wait right here.

17:41.533 --> 17:42.700
Hello?

18:09.133 --> 18:11.066
'You aren't going to like'

18:11.133 --> 18:13.133
what you find in here.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.933
You should go back.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.733
There's no place like home.

18:23.233 --> 18:25.300
'There's no place like home.'

18:26.666 --> 18:29.566
'There's no place like home.'

18:38.200 --> 18:39.466
'Rox?'

18:39.533 --> 18:40.700
'Rox, where are you?'

18:41.700 --> 18:44.500
Are you even listening to me?

18:44.566 --> 18:46.700
Rox, you're gonna push yourself
over the edge

18:46.766 --> 18:49.000
and I'm gonna lose you!

18:49.066 --> 18:50.066
I'm gonna take you home.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.233
I'm fine! I'm fine.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.300
Come on, Rox, let's go.

19:04.933 --> 19:07.166
- Let it go!
- No!

19:07.233 --> 19:10.233
Rox, you can't do this.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.333
Rox, it's not your house.

19:15.033 --> 19:16.333
Please.

19:41.500 --> 19:45.033
Oh, what the hell
are you doing here?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.400
You wanted your stuff
moved, didn't you?

19:47.466 --> 19:48.700
Yes.

19:48.766 --> 19:51.133
Well, the company told me
to get my ass down here.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.433
I'm waiting on the rest
of the crew and the truck.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.433
Oh, that's great.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.100
What are you doing here?
You got a thing for me?

20:01.433 --> 20:02.433
Doug!

20:05.333 --> 20:07.433
Doug, where are you?

20:11.900 --> 20:13.333
What's the matter?

20:16.966 --> 20:20.033
I don't think it's entirely
necessary you do this right now.

20:20.100 --> 20:23.400
- But the lady just said--
- It is not necessary!

20:31.633 --> 20:33.766
Wait, where are you going?
I still want my stuff moved.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.300
Lady, I would like
to help you out

20:35.366 --> 20:38.033
but I can't do anything if that
guy throws me out of his house.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.933
That guy, his house,
what are you talking about?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.366
It's his house!

20:41.433 --> 20:43.566
If he throws me out of it,
there's nothing I can do.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.500
This house belongs
to my husband.

20:46.566 --> 20:48.533
That guy is your husband?

20:50.300 --> 20:52.233
You guys are nuts.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.900
You had to look, didn't you?

21:10.766 --> 21:13.500
You couldn't wait
until tomorrow.

21:13.566 --> 21:15.933
Everything would've been
just fine..

21:16.000 --> 21:19.233
...if you would've been
a little patient.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.933
I don't understand.

21:22.466 --> 21:24.300
You see, Rox..

21:24.366 --> 21:28.000
...there's a side of me
you don't know.

21:28.066 --> 21:31.000
All my other wives found out.

21:31.066 --> 21:33.033
'It's too bad about them, huh?'

21:35.200 --> 21:38.300
But if there hadn't have been
this one little screw-up..

21:39.566 --> 21:41.333
'...you would've never
found out about it.'

21:41.400 --> 21:44.100
And what you don't know
won't hurt you.

21:45.466 --> 21:47.933
This marriage could have worked.

21:51.766 --> 21:55.100
All those sickos
and those weirdos I defended.

21:56.433 --> 21:58.133
'They were amateurs.'

21:59.333 --> 22:03.066
And that man
you were talking about..

22:03.133 --> 22:05.700
...you were right
about one thing.

22:05.766 --> 22:06.800
What?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.400
I do like it.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.200
I like it a lot.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.633
So are you happily married?

22:34.700 --> 22:38.066
Look at your spouse,
go ahead. Look.

22:38.133 --> 22:40.600
You looked, didn't you?

22:40.666 --> 22:42.300
Let me ask you something.

22:42.366 --> 22:44.933
How well do you really know him?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.066
Thinking of moving?

22:49.133 --> 22:50.866
Give Springwood a shot.

22:50.933 --> 22:54.233
Come for a night, stay forever.

23:13.866 --> 23:16.266
Are you sure
all those boxes are mine?

23:16.333 --> 23:18.133
Yeah, lady, they're all yours.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.233
I didn't realize
I had that much stuff.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.866
Well, that's what they all say.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.133
I'm glad
I didn't disappoint you.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.333
Put them in the bedroom,
I'll deal with them later.

23:35.033 --> 23:36.766
Wow!

23:36.833 --> 23:41.333
So you are an archaeologist.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.366
Oh, isn't that interesting?

23:44.433 --> 23:47.133
I've always been
fascinated with Egypt.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.900
Oh, me too.

23:48.966 --> 23:51.333
Unfortunately, I don't kno
very much about it.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.166
My specialty
is American Indians.

23:53.233 --> 23:56.700
Oh, that's very pretty.

23:56.766 --> 24:00.900
Are you, uh, digging
somewhere in Springwood?

24:00.966 --> 24:02.300
No, no dig.

24:02.366 --> 24:05.266
Just an assistantship
at the university.

24:05.333 --> 24:06.866
I'm not knocking it.

24:06.933 --> 24:09.166
It's a very good opportunity.

24:09.233 --> 24:12.100
But I'd rather be out there
getting my hands dirty.

24:13.433 --> 24:17.000
There's something romantic
about touching history.

24:17.066 --> 24:19.033
And are you seeing someone?

24:20.600 --> 24:21.933
No.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.133
No, I'm not.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.966
Well, I know
a lot of nice young men.

24:27.033 --> 24:30.000
Oh, heh, well, thanks anyway.

24:30.066 --> 24:31.966
But after years
of field-testing, I have come

24:32.033 --> 24:35.933
to the conclusion that what
I'm looking for isn't out there.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.300
I always seem to pick
the wrong guys.

24:37.366 --> 24:38.900
Yeah, but you never know.

24:38.966 --> 24:40.466
Things could change.

24:42.166 --> 24:45.733
Well, I guess I better
leave you to your unpacking.

24:47.466 --> 24:51.266
If you need anything,
Emily, I'm right next door.

24:51.333 --> 24:53.200
Thanks, Rose. I appreciate it.

24:53.266 --> 24:54.500
'Mm-hmm.'

24:56.700 --> 24:59.233
Do you want me to put this box
marked "Kitchen" in the kitchen?

24:59.300 --> 25:01.733
No, put the box marked
"Kitchen" in the bathroom.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.200
That way I'll know where
to find the pots and pans.

25:04.266 --> 25:06.300
I could just dump it right here.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.600
Yeah, you could do that.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.433
You know, I heard what
you said to the old lady.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.933
We should talk.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.300
I mean, here you are new in town

25:20.366 --> 25:22.033
here I am a native.

25:22.100 --> 25:24.933
I could show you around.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.966
Thanks anyway, Romeo.

25:27.033 --> 25:28.800
But, uh, I don't think
you're my type.

25:28.866 --> 25:31.700
No? What is your type?

25:31.766 --> 25:34.433
I'm working on it.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.933
Close the door after you. Okay?

25:51.233 --> 25:54.400
'And, hey, babe,
I really respect you.'

25:54.466 --> 25:57.633
'I mean it, I've been
looking high and low'

25:57.700 --> 26:01.633
for the perfect woman,
and you are just my type.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.800
My dream girl.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.700
Mm. I mean, you get me so hot.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.766
But you know what
I like the most.

26:08.833 --> 26:12.066
It's that love line
in your socket.

26:15.333 --> 26:18.933
I only have eyes for you.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.333
"My darling Gregory.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.266
"I know this is dangerous,
but I cannot help myself.

27:45.333 --> 27:48.300
"I simply had to tell you
how very much I love you.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.133
"My heart is bursting.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.233
"Please tell me
this is notimposs

27:52.300 --> 27:54.000
"I don't care
if you're married.

27:54.066 --> 27:56.400
"We must be together somehow.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.566
"If I cannot be with you,
I fear I will die.

27:59.633 --> 28:01.500
Your loving Jane."

30:35.500 --> 30:37.000
Gregory.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.833
Are you still here?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.933
I was dusting
and I found this loose panel.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.766
The panel fell off
and there they were.

31:51.833 --> 31:54.366
It's amazing.

31:54.433 --> 31:56.533
Who were they from?

31:56.600 --> 32:00.433
Someone named Jane
to someone named Gregory.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.266
They're incredible.

32:02.333 --> 32:05.433
They're beyond romantic.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.766
Jane was Gregory's mistress.

32:07.833 --> 32:09.566
- His mistress?
- Mm-hmm.

32:09.633 --> 32:10.933
Hoo-hoo!

32:11.000 --> 32:12.600
Sounds wicked.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.066
But what about the wife?

32:16.133 --> 32:18.566
I've been up
all night reading these.

32:18.633 --> 32:22.133
Jane and Gregory really loved
each other heart and soul.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.833
Do you have any idea
who they were?

32:23.900 --> 32:27.533
Not a clue. I've been
living here for 30 years.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.000
Never heard of any Gregory
or any Jane.

32:31.066 --> 32:32.866
Any idea when this apartment
house was built?

32:32.933 --> 32:35.300
Hmm, 1890 I think. It..

32:35.366 --> 32:38.300
That's what I was always told.

32:38.366 --> 32:42.666
This was Springwood's
first high-rise.

32:42.733 --> 32:45.633
You know, these apartments
used to be a lot larger.

32:45.700 --> 32:48.833
Yours and mine
used to be one apartment.

32:53.033 --> 32:56.433
What must have gone
on here before..

32:56.500 --> 32:58.733
...within these walls?

33:44.433 --> 33:46.166
"Darling, I'm afraid

33:44.433 --> 33:46.166
there's something

33:46.233 --> 33:47.600
"we must face together.

33:47.666 --> 33:50.166
"Something that threatens
to tear us apart.

33:50.233 --> 33:52.800
I fear that Margaret
has become suspicious of us."

34:12.966 --> 34:16.033
Have I told you before
how very much I love you?

35:13.833 --> 35:16.466
The letters are getting
more and more intense.

35:16.533 --> 35:19.000
Gregory is more
passionate than ever.

35:19.066 --> 35:22.800
He says he can't live
without Jane.

35:22.866 --> 35:25.233
But Gregory's wife Margare

35:25.300 --> 35:28.233
is starting to get suspicious.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.000
She's even spying on us.

35:31.066 --> 35:32.200
Us?

35:33.100 --> 35:35.500
Did I say us?

35:35.566 --> 35:37.266
I was thinking
of rearranging the furniture

35:37.333 --> 35:39.300
to the way it was
when Gregory lived here.

35:39.366 --> 35:41.000
'How could you do that?'

35:41.066 --> 35:43.533
'Do the letters
have floor plans?'

35:43.600 --> 35:45.033
Hmm. Kind of.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.666
They made love in almost
every room of the house.

35:50.733 --> 35:53.100
'You've been
holding back on me.'

35:53.166 --> 35:56.200
You didn't tell me
there were any good parts.

35:56.266 --> 35:57.733
Oh, there are.

35:59.366 --> 36:02.566
There are some very good parts.

36:02.633 --> 36:05.433
Well, how did he pull that off?

36:05.500 --> 36:09.533
Where was the wife while the two
of them were screwing around?

36:09.600 --> 36:12.866
Well, sometimes at tea parties.

36:12.933 --> 36:16.333
Sometimes at their house
in the country.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.700
It was all planned
very carefully.

36:21.533 --> 36:23.500
Gregory thought of everything.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.633
I didn't scare you, did I?

36:51.700 --> 36:54.300
Oh, you're strange.
Anybody ever tell you that

36:54.366 --> 36:56.700
I've been thinking about you.

36:56.766 --> 36:58.800
And I want you
to go out with me.

36:58.866 --> 37:01.400
Nothing personal.
But I'm not interested.

37:03.633 --> 37:06.533
Come on. You're not that busy.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.033
What about tonight?

37:10.333 --> 37:12.866
Aren't you interested
in a real man?

37:12.933 --> 37:14.933
I've got a date.

37:22.133 --> 37:24.300
"My darling..

37:24.366 --> 37:27.233
"...I want to be
in your arms again

37:27.300 --> 37:30.100
"to feel your mouth on mine

37:30.166 --> 37:32.100
and hear your whisper."

37:46.566 --> 37:49.066
I love you.

37:49.133 --> 37:52.000
I wanna be in your arms again..

37:52.066 --> 37:54.500
...to feel your mouth on mine.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.033
To know your touch.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.100
Oh, to kiss.

39:45.933 --> 39:47.000
He's mine!

39:58.533 --> 40:01.666
So...what's the latest?

40:01.733 --> 40:05.433
And this time,
tell me the good stuff first.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.400
I don't wanna talk about
the letters anymore.

40:07.466 --> 40:10.466
They're making you lonely?

40:10.533 --> 40:13.033
What's more romantic?

40:13.100 --> 40:15.733
Bein' the wife
or-or bein' the other woman?

40:15.800 --> 40:17.200
Oh! That's easy.

40:17.266 --> 40:19.100
The other woman.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.300
She only sees
the best parts of him.

40:21.366 --> 40:23.300
Shouldn't be that way.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.300
'Dream on, sweetie.'

40:26.366 --> 40:28.100
No. No, I'm finished with him.

40:28.166 --> 40:29.366
Done.

40:29.433 --> 40:31.300
What happened?

40:32.166 --> 40:33.966
He didn't dump her, did he?

40:34.033 --> 40:36.766
No. No, he didn't.

40:39.300 --> 40:42.200
Jane was...exciting.

40:42.266 --> 40:44.500
Impetuous, romantic.

40:44.566 --> 40:46.966
'She'd risk anything for him.'

40:47.033 --> 40:49.733
She was the perfect mistress.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.533
But Margret..

40:51.600 --> 40:53.666
...she loved him.

40:53.733 --> 40:55.700
Supported him.

40:57.233 --> 41:00.400
But she wasn't enough.

41:00.466 --> 41:02.500
But she was his wife.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.566
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

41:06.633 --> 41:08.233
Okay? I just..
It's over.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.100
It's finished.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.200
Look, I don't understand.
What is wrong with me?

41:37.266 --> 41:38.200
What?

41:38.266 --> 41:39.733
All I want to do is go out

41:39.800 --> 41:41.033
What's wrong with that?

41:41.100 --> 41:42.900
Nothing. Really, it's..

41:42.966 --> 41:45.000
It's just I'm involved.

41:45.066 --> 41:46.433
You don't sound too sure
about that.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.333
I don't think you know
what you want.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.333
No, I do.

41:52.733 --> 41:54.666
What? A-a guy
has got to be perfect.

41:54.733 --> 41:57.300
Or you're not interested.
Is that it?

41:57.366 --> 41:58.800
What's wrong with perfect?

41:58.866 --> 42:00.966
It doesn't exists.

42:01.033 --> 42:04.033
Well, I can find it.

42:10.466 --> 42:12.600
I hope you like yourself

42:12.666 --> 42:14.100
because with an attitude
like that

42:14.166 --> 42:17.466
you're gonna be alone
for a long time.

42:54.566 --> 42:56.233
Oh, no.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.266
Oh, I don't wanna be here.

43:02.333 --> 43:04.500
I don't wanna be in this dream.

43:11.333 --> 43:13.533
Do you know how much I hate you?

43:13.600 --> 43:15.766
How much I despise you?

43:15.833 --> 43:17.233
I'm sorry, I never thought--

43:17.300 --> 43:19.133
I won't let you come between us.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.533
He means too much to me.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.466
There's no reason for this.
It's over.

43:23.533 --> 43:25.400
Do you think I'm that stupid?

43:25.466 --> 43:27.433
Do you think I can't see
straight through you?

43:27.500 --> 43:28.800
I don't wanna destroy
what you have.

43:28.866 --> 43:30.300
I have my own life to lead.

43:30.366 --> 43:33.400
You don't deserve
a man like Gregory.

43:39.266 --> 43:41.266
Oh, Gregory,
thank God you're here.

43:41.333 --> 43:44.666
I'm sorry it had
to be this way, Margret.

43:44.733 --> 43:47.633
Margret? But I'm Jane.

43:47.700 --> 43:50.533
No. You're nothing like Jane.

43:50.600 --> 43:51.733
You don't know me.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.933
You've never seen me before.

43:58.233 --> 43:59.533
It's red.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.966
My hair...it's not red.

44:03.033 --> 44:05.700
- 'Of course it is, Margret.'
- It can't be.

44:05.766 --> 44:08.666
We've fallen in love,
Jane and I.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.900
And we can't be together
if I'm married to you.

44:10.966 --> 44:12.933
Oh, Gregory.

44:13.800 --> 44:17.300
I wish I didn't have to do this.

44:17.366 --> 44:20.200
But I really have no choice.

44:20.266 --> 44:22.200
I don't understand.

44:22.266 --> 44:24.500
I was Jane.

44:24.566 --> 44:26.533
Iwas

44:29.666 --> 44:31.600
Aah!

44:33.766 --> 44:34.733
Aah!

44:49.200 --> 44:52.633
Next time you're alone
in your house

44:52.700 --> 44:55.433
think about who went before you.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.933
It might be pretty crowded.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.500
The dead have to go somewhere.

45:02.566 --> 45:03.966
Aah!

45:04.033 --> 45:06.866
Now this is what I call

45:06.933 --> 45:08.366
love letters!
