16:00.043 --> 16:03.129
My man was waiting for you.
You never showed up.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.089
Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry about that.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.758
I want what you owe me.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.927
My brother took it.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.390
It's just--
It's a big brother, little brother--

16:13.557 --> 16:15.600
Where is my shit?

16:15.767 --> 16:18.353
He says he dumped it in the ocean,
but that's bullshit

16:18.520 --> 16:20.021
because he's a fucking Boy Scout.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.941
And there is no way
he's gonna destroy that evidence

16:23.107 --> 16:25.318
because he wants to use it.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.528
For what?

16:27.278 --> 16:29.656
To take you down.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.577
I don't think he gives a shit
about the drugs. It's the girls.

16:33.744 --> 16:36.538
What the fuck are you talking about?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.918
I guess the guy just draws the line
at torching immigrants.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.422
I can get your stuff back, Wayne.

16:45.589 --> 16:49.634
- Get the fuck out of my store.
- Hey, I am the only guy

16:49.801 --> 16:53.096
- that can get your stuff back.
- Get out.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.810
[Marco]
John. Any word on Danny?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.896
- Not yet.
- We still got uniforms looking for him.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.857
It should just be a matter of time
before someone spots him.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.736
When they do, I wanna bring him in.

17:50.821 --> 17:53.239
The guy took his niece out
for a boat ride.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.242
- And nothing happened to her, so...
- He threatened her.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.369
Physically? Verbally?

17:58.536 --> 18:01.372
- Was she taken against her will?
- It was against my will.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.001
You know you need
more than that, John.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.209
That's not enough.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.423
It'll be my daughter's word against his.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.426
So you want your daughter to...

18:14.427 --> 18:15.512
To lie.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.183
Janey doesn't understand
what he was doing.

18:20.851 --> 18:22.769
He was sending a message.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.438
Not to her. To me.

18:26.023 --> 18:28.066
He can get to her anytime he wants.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.526
Why?

18:29.693 --> 18:31.486
You wanna be part of this family?

18:31.653 --> 18:33.030
Danny...

18:34.739 --> 18:37.158
Danny's a threat to himself

18:37.325 --> 18:38.994
and to the family.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.372
So when they bring him in,

18:42.539 --> 18:45.249
we're gonna find something
that sticks, all right?

18:47.544 --> 18:49.713
Until he breaks the law,

18:49.880 --> 18:52.090
there's absolutely nothing we could do.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.593
If the DEA would've found the drugs
in the shed, we'd have him.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.805
- We don't have shit, you understand?
- Well, then, be creative.

18:58.972 --> 19:02.183
I'm afraid for my fucking family.
Do you understand that?

19:03.226 --> 19:04.435
Yeah, I understand.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.981
I also understand there's a fuck-load
of shit you're not telling me.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.149
You want my help?

19:11.943 --> 19:14.946
Then tell me what the fuck is going on.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.659
I have, Marco.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.703
All of it.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.622
Like what really happened
to the cocaine.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.876
I've told you everything.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.255
I wish I could help you.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.554
[♪♪♪]

20:03.327 --> 20:05.288
I got a lead on where
to find Danny Rayburn.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.998
I already found him.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.375
Son of a bitch showed up
at my shop this morning.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.087
Just walks right in,
tells me the product is gone.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.339
- Gone?
- He said his brother took it.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.259
But he thinks he can get it back.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.219
I'd say it's time to cut your losses.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.890
That's a big fucking bundle
to give up on.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.392
Tell me what to do.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.900
Eric told me you left.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.902
I did.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.697
Without saying goodbye?

20:40.698 --> 20:43.660
Well, I'm back now. Ahem.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.245
What's going on, Danny?

20:46.412 --> 20:47.789
I don't know.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.791
What's going on?

20:53.628 --> 20:55.588
You're in trouble, aren't you?

20:57.132 --> 21:00.218
It's just-- It's family bullshit.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.594
It's...

21:02.179 --> 21:05.140
But we probably shouldn't
have too much contact

21:05.306 --> 21:07.184
in the next little while.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.520
Then, why are we talking?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.857
Well, I just gotta figure
this shit out with John.

21:14.024 --> 21:16.359
Then everything's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be fine.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.695
I'm not gonna have to leave anymore.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.366
You really believe that, don't you?

21:24.701 --> 21:27.078
Yeah, I just gotta chill that family out.

21:28.038 --> 21:29.580
No, you don't.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.667
You just need to forget them.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.298
Can I borrow your car?

21:39.465 --> 21:40.466
Why?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.552
Just for a couple of days.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.014
Please, CeCe.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.598
For real.

22:00.111 --> 22:03.614
I learned a long time ago
you can't save people from themselves.

22:03.781 --> 22:06.159
They either figure it out on their own
or they don't.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.791
It needs gas.

24:22.337 --> 24:24.214
Yeah, it's me. I found him.

24:24.381 --> 24:27.300
- [John] Where?
- Mile marker 91. The Tom Thumb station.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.010
Keep him there. I'll be there soon.

24:29.177 --> 24:31.137
Wait. Wait, John!

24:34.473 --> 24:37.143
- Uhn!
- Looking for your pal Danny.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.062
I don't know any fucking Danny.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.898

Come on, John. Come on.
Where the fuck are you?

What's going on, Kev?

25:37.703 --> 25:39.580
John's looking for you.

25:40.290 --> 25:41.458
He wants to talk to you.

25:41.624 --> 25:42.833
Oh, yeah?

25:43.334 --> 25:45.378
Yeah, I don't think so.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.838
What about you?

25:48.589 --> 25:50.049
Anything you wanna say to me?

25:53.094 --> 25:54.095
No?

25:54.971 --> 25:59.100
Wow. Usually, you can't keep
your fucking mouth shut.

25:59.267 --> 26:00.977
Now you look just like the little boy

26:01.144 --> 26:04.063

so much time ignoring.

Get in the car, Danny.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.987
Hey.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.990
Should've led with that.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.368
Get in the fucking car.

26:17.535 --> 26:18.536
Yeah, I don't think so.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.622
Put the fucking gun away, Kevin.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

Get in.

- Get in the fucking car.
- Or what?

What are you gonna do?

26:43.769 --> 26:45.604
You know something, Kevin?

- Yeah.

You gotta tell Mom, all right?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.412
You should get out too.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.039
And stay the fuck away from Danny.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.207
Why?

God, I don't know, I wasn't there.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.295
This guy scared
the shit out of my brother.

I mean, Eric was so scared, he left town.
And believe me, he has nowhere to go.

Now this guy is looking for Danny.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.928
- Looking for him?
- To hurt him.

28:41.095 --> 28:44.390
- And Eric thinks he's gonna kill him.
- Have you told Danny this?

28:44.557 --> 28:48.227
Well, he won't answer my calls,
and I'm afraid to be near him.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.605
I didn't know who else to tell.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.898
You gotta do something, John.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.487
This guy looking for Danny,
if he can't find him, he can't hurt him.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.324
Eric told him where Danny's staying.

29:02.325 --> 29:03.993
Where is that?

29:06.078 --> 29:08.164
At the Red Reef Motel.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.192
I'll go first.

37:56.358 --> 37:57.526
Okay, Mom...

37:57.693 --> 37:59.277
[clears throat]

37:59.695 --> 38:03.699
I'm sure there's a whole bunch of stuff
that John's told you about me.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.325
It's all true.

38:07.203 --> 38:09.538
I fell in with some bad people.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.207
I, um...

38:11.414 --> 38:14.334
I needed money, saw an opportunity.

38:16.128 --> 38:20.465
The paycheck you were giving me wasn't
gonna cut it, so I started dealing drugs.

38:23.219 --> 38:27.723
So I guess what happened tonight
is partly my fault.

38:28.807 --> 38:29.975
What happened tonight?

38:34.230 --> 38:35.939
A guy tried to kill me.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.984
[Sally]
What? Oh, God, Danny.

38:39.151 --> 38:41.319
- Who tried to kill you?
- He's a guy I know.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.405
- Business associate.
- [Sally] You call the police?

38:43.572 --> 38:45.657
I didn't. If I called police,
I'd get arrested--

38:45.824 --> 38:47.784
This is crazy.
Mom doesn't need to hear this.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.870
No, Meg.

38:50.037 --> 38:53.290
- Let him talk. I need to hear this.
- You're done. Get the fuck out.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.834
- Just hold on. Quiet!
- [Kevin] Get the fuck out of here.

38:56.001 --> 39:00.672
Just let me finish, okay? Just a couple
more words, and then I'm gone. Okay?

39:00.839 --> 39:03.926
So clearly I'm in danger
because these guys are really pissed off.

39:04.093 --> 39:06.220
I don't know
what they were gonna do to me,

39:06.386 --> 39:10.557
but since I used the inn
to bring the drugs through...

39:11.391 --> 39:13.518
now you're all in danger.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.524
What do you mean, you used the inn?

39:19.691 --> 39:24.196
Normally I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not,
because you're all liars.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.074
- Like it always has been.
- Danny, would you just stop it?

39:27.241 --> 39:29.326
And you are the worst!

39:30.953 --> 39:33.496
You always took Dad's side.
You never protected me.

39:35.207 --> 39:38.001
I've never felt safe in this house.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.923
And now, none of you are safe
in this house.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.884
What the fuck is that supposed
to mean, huh, Dan? Huh?

39:47.886 --> 39:53.309
You have finally lived up
to your father's expectations, Danny.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.358
Just leave me alone.

What the fuck?

40:06.571 --> 40:08.740
[Kevin]
Son of a bitch.

40:10.784 --> 40:13.536
Someone tried to kill him tonight?
Did you know about this?

40:16.165 --> 40:17.624
- No.
- Well, you talked to him,

40:17.791 --> 40:20.085
and you said that everything
was gonna be fine.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.795
I thought it was.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.088
What did he say?

40:23.255 --> 40:25.590
He said that he wants to meet
tomorrow morning.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.969
- He wants to talk, and I agreed.
- We'll take care of this tonight.

40:29.136 --> 40:32.389
You're not gonna do a goddamn thing.
You're gonna stay here with Meg.

40:32.555 --> 40:35.851
And you're gonna help her with Mom,
is what you're gonna do.

Yeah, he had a gun.

41:31.073 --> 41:33.658
Obviously, somebody got the drop on him.

What are you gonna do about Danny?
Huh? You gonna do something?

41:51.509 --> 41:53.011
I'll fix it.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.847
You know that I found a gun in his--

41:56.014 --> 41:57.515
One of his suitcases, huh?

41:58.475 --> 41:59.726
No, I didn't know that.

No, I know you didn't know that.

42:02.271 --> 42:04.981
But it's not-- It's not in his suitcase.

42:05.774 --> 42:07.484
It's in my fucking hand right now.

42:08.277 --> 42:11.571
- Listen to me, Kevin--
- If you won't do something about this...

42:13.198 --> 42:14.199
I will.

42:16.243 --> 42:17.869
He's come after me once.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.414
- What the fuck you talking about?
- It was Danny

42:20.580 --> 42:22.749
who fucking attacked me.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.460
He fucking admitted it.

42:24.626 --> 42:27.670
Kevin, listen to me. I have
to make this right. I'll talk to him.

42:27.837 --> 42:29.131
What are you gonna say?

42:29.298 --> 42:31.425
I'm gonna tell him
what he wants to hear.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.177
You always give him
what he fucking wants!

42:34.344 --> 42:36.472
All right, fine. Listen to me.
Goddamn it.

42:36.638 --> 42:38.181
And it's never enough, John!

42:38.640 --> 42:40.600
It's never fucking enough!

No more fucking talk.

All right, fine, Kevin.

No more fucking talk.

Yes, sir.

- [young John] He was hit by a car.
- [Danny] Got hit by a car.

Didn't have the guts to tell me, though.

Is that what this is about?

I don't know, John.

How can we work it out?

Not forever.
Just until things calm down.

Give it some time. We figure it out,
but you can't be here right now.

You just want me to absolve you.

You were right about everything.

I let the family scapegoat you. I did.

49:44.232 --> 49:45.608
I'm sorry.

49:46.317 --> 49:50.405
Because you were never given the chance
to have the life I have, and I see that.

But you can't be here.

You expect me to forget about this?

50:15.304 --> 50:17.724
I can forgive so much.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.900
- Not that.
- You can't forgive yourself.

50:27.650 --> 50:30.987
- Because you should have been there.
- You keep saying that.

50:32.864 --> 50:34.866
You had me convinced.

After all these years, I thought, yeah,
maybe it could've been me on that boat.

50:39.913 --> 50:42.498
If things had been
just a little bit different,

50:42.665 --> 50:44.417
I would have taken her.

50:45.752 --> 50:46.795
Never.

50:46.962 --> 50:49.422
- No, you keep telling yourself that--
- You know why?

50:49.589 --> 50:53.802
Because she was 10 years old
and she shouldn't have been out there.

50:53.969 --> 50:56.220
I told you not to take her
and you remember that.

50:56.387 --> 50:57.555
I fucking told you.

You did, and that was your choice,
so don't blame Sarah's death on me.

- All these years, you all blamed me!
- You were a fuckup before Sarah!

I was always protecting you, always
standing up for your fucking mistakes.

51:08.441 --> 51:11.152

- I was the one who could never fuck up.

51:11.319 --> 51:12.612
I was the responsible one.

making everything okay

51:15.239 --> 51:16.616

51:16.783 --> 51:19.619
because it was Danny who was
always turning everything to shit!

- Let it out. Let the hate out, John.
- I don't hate you.

51:23.205 --> 51:26.960
I never could hate you.
That's my fucking problem!

51:32.799 --> 51:34.801

51:37.971 --> 51:40.556
I want you to know how it feels.

51:42.391 --> 51:44.435

to have to go through your whole life

You want me to leave?

51:54.570 --> 51:56.155
Beg me.

Get down on your knees,

Beg me!

What the fuck does that mean?

52:23.808 --> 52:25.267

52:26.019 --> 52:29.146
Your life's not always
gonna be so perfect.

52:33.818 --> 52:36.071
So you're not gonna beg me?
