00:21.297 --> 00:23.181
So, Bobby, what are we gonna say

00:23.253 --> 00:24.410
to the bank manager tomorrow?

00:24.440 --> 00:26.037
If we don't get those loans
restructured,

00:26.067 --> 00:26.948
we're up a creek.

00:27.071 --> 00:29.333
Screwed Creek.
Don't worry, Lin.

00:29.406 --> 00:30.279
I got it all worked out.

00:30.401 --> 00:31.960
Very convincing stuff.

00:32.084 --> 00:33.481
Let's hear it.
All right.

00:33.552 --> 00:34.769
Action!

00:34.840 --> 00:36.273
As you know, sir,

00:36.345 --> 00:38.079
we have several loans
with your institution,

00:38.151 --> 00:40.091
all "past due."

00:40.215 --> 00:42.831
But what does "past due"
even mean, you know?

00:42.928 --> 00:45.851
It's brilliant!
There's no such thing as time.

00:45.978 --> 00:48.055
Gene was past due
and he came out fine.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.817
I wish I stayed in there!
Hey.

00:49.941 --> 00:51.641
Get out of there. Gene!
Let me in!

00:51.713 --> 00:52.947
Let me back in!
Gene! Bob!

00:53.017 --> 00:54.092
Oh, God.
This is your son.

00:54.215 --> 00:55.633
Sorry, Gene. No backsies.

00:55.768 --> 00:57.769
You can't put the candy
back in mom's wrapper.

00:57.841 --> 01:00.259
You know, I have a savings
account at First Oceanside.

01:00.332 --> 01:02.200
So I might have some pull over there.

01:02.272 --> 01:04.574
Thanks, Teen, but I think
I got this covered.

01:04.646 --> 01:06.781
No.
Look, I know we owe money

01:06.854 --> 01:08.788
and my credit score's
on the low side, but...

01:08.860 --> 01:10.460
It is the low side, Bob.

01:10.532 --> 01:12.333
It's kind of an inside joke
around here. Hmm.

01:12.404 --> 01:14.005
That's funny... but I would

01:14.077 --> 01:16.278
still like you to look at the loan.

01:16.351 --> 01:17.851
No.

01:17.923 --> 01:19.524
Well, it's really important that...

01:19.595 --> 01:20.896
Bob, I have to take this call.

01:20.966 --> 01:22.534
That's... not a phone.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.138
Well I...
I still have to take it.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.527
Great. Well, then I will,

01:25.581 --> 01:27.715
leave you your piece
of paper phone call.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.989
I just wish that
you... nope.

01:30.062 --> 01:31.362
You know what, forget it!

01:31.433 --> 01:33.234
"Always on your side."

01:33.306 --> 01:35.740
Ha! I'll
make a scene!

01:37.052 --> 01:38.936
Um... I'm
gonna leave.

01:41.081 --> 01:43.016
Hey, thanks, man.

01:43.087 --> 01:44.404
Whoa!

01:44.475 --> 01:46.092
Get a car, idiot!

01:46.164 --> 01:49.600
Gonna check on my money.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.610
The bank manager didn't go for it.

01:51.683 --> 01:53.584
And he was mean.

01:53.639 --> 01:55.823
My God, Bobby, what'd you do?

01:55.896 --> 01:58.230
Nothing. I just punched
a cardboard cutout guy.

01:58.303 --> 02:01.122
I didn't even punch it, I
just flicked it. Oh, Bobby.

02:01.196 --> 02:04.082
Man, I got to do this stupid
essay for English class

02:04.156 --> 02:06.558
on "someone important to me."

02:06.631 --> 02:07.964
I'd write about the guy

02:08.035 --> 02:09.633
who flies the helicopter
on The Bachelor.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.091
Look at all those police!

02:11.162 --> 02:13.897
This is a good time for me to
be stuck in that tree again.

02:13.972 --> 02:15.672
Kids! Get in here!

02:15.743 --> 02:17.994
Channel six news.

02:18.068 --> 02:19.545
They'll finger anything with a pulse.

02:19.575 --> 02:21.240
I'm pretty sure their slogan is,

02:21.311 --> 02:22.869
their "finger's on the
pulse," Gene. No!

02:22.899 --> 02:25.135
That can't be right.
It's right.

02:25.208 --> 02:28.326
Ooh, SWAT team's here. Intense.

02:28.401 --> 02:30.836
That guy's important.
You can tell by the way he points.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.677
He's fingering right at us!

02:32.749 --> 02:34.950
Tell those guys to get
behind the barricade, now!

02:35.023 --> 02:36.580
There's a hostage
situation at the bank.

02:36.610 --> 02:37.710
We need this restaurant.

02:39.236 --> 02:41.037
This is, um, interesting.

02:41.109 --> 02:42.642
The restaurant will get on TV. I know.

02:42.714 --> 02:44.315
I was just thinking the same thing.

02:44.386 --> 02:46.054
That's a lot of coffee's going out.

02:46.126 --> 02:48.627
Write it all down, all the
coffees, we got to keep track.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.167
Snipers
are in position on the roof.

02:50.239 --> 02:51.399
Oh, God, that's embarrassing.

02:51.460 --> 02:53.110
Our gutters are a mess.

02:53.181 --> 02:54.481
Hello. My name's
Louise.

02:54.536 --> 02:57.305
I would like to donate a piece
of my personal chalk

02:57.378 --> 02:59.413
in case you need to outline a body.

02:59.486 --> 03:00.836
Is my money safe in that bank?

03:00.907 --> 03:02.174
What are these kids doing here!

03:02.244 --> 03:03.511
U-Uh, they're our kids.

03:03.582 --> 03:05.015
They, uh, work-slash-live here.

03:05.070 --> 03:07.304
Well, keep them
out of the way. You got me?

03:07.377 --> 03:09.278
Do I have a hard line yet? Line's up.

03:10.688 --> 03:12.456
Who's breathing on my line?!

03:12.528 --> 03:14.729
All I know is
I was just talking to Ken,

03:14.801 --> 03:17.286
and now I'm on hold at the bank.
Hey!

03:17.360 --> 03:18.677
Everyone shhhh!

03:18.748 --> 03:20.215
God, we're making the call.
Shut up.

03:20.286 --> 03:22.287
This is Sergeant Bosco,
and I'm in charge.

03:22.359 --> 03:23.593
Uh, who am I speaking with?

03:23.664 --> 03:24.997
All right, Mickey,

03:25.068 --> 03:27.303
how many people you
got in there? Eight.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.295
Okay, Mickey, this is what
we're gonna do: You...

03:29.332 --> 03:30.633
Uh-huh.

03:30.703 --> 03:31.970
He wants pizza.
Oh, come on.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.458
They always want pizza.

03:33.529 --> 03:35.763
Isn't there an Italian
place across the street?

03:35.836 --> 03:37.870
Jimmy Pesto's? Heard
that place was pretty good.

03:37.943 --> 03:39.544
Get six pizzas over there quick.

03:39.616 --> 03:41.917
No. That could've
been huge for us.

03:43.862 --> 03:45.496
I hope this standoff ends...

03:45.568 --> 03:47.435
pizza-fully.

03:47.507 --> 03:49.875
Pepper-Ono-he-didn't!

03:49.949 --> 03:51.266
Ugh, you believe this?

03:51.337 --> 03:52.820
Pesto is getting the free advertising

03:52.891 --> 03:54.241
we were supposed to get.

04:05.416 --> 04:06.783
How does, uh...

04:06.854 --> 04:08.221
one get into robot driving?

04:08.291 --> 04:11.110
Did you go to robot college?!

04:11.201 --> 04:13.202
Come on, give me your keys, Seth.

04:13.274 --> 04:14.574
I'm fine.

04:14.645 --> 04:17.981
I only have
to drive .37 miles.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.322
We're in college, dude.

04:19.394 --> 04:21.028
Chillax.

04:23.775 --> 04:25.326
Are you sure you guys are naked?!

04:25.413 --> 04:26.747
Totally.

04:26.819 --> 04:28.069
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh...

04:28.139 --> 04:29.622
Oh! Ugh.

04:29.694 --> 04:31.334
I was just performing
routine maintenance.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.234
Doesn't anyone knock around here?

04:33.306 --> 04:35.173
Jeez.

04:35.245 --> 04:36.763
There's no such thing
as robot college.

04:36.793 --> 04:38.017
Not yet!

04:38.088 --> 04:39.522
Shots fired! Shots fired!

04:40.897 --> 04:42.898
Finally, some gun play.

04:42.971 --> 04:45.305
Down in front! Thank you.

04:47.067 --> 04:49.602
That was the worst pizza I ever had!

04:49.676 --> 04:51.543
Jimmy Pesto's is crap!

04:51.632 --> 04:53.466
Yes!

04:53.538 --> 04:55.605
Ouch.

04:55.678 --> 04:57.696
Yeah. I'm sorry
about the pizzas.

04:57.768 --> 04:58.985
Um, what do you want instead?

04:59.056 --> 05:00.240
Chinese?
Burgers.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.547
Mexican?
This is a burger place.

05:01.577 --> 05:03.148
What about Hot Pockets?

05:03.219 --> 05:04.928
Burgers are right here.
Or nonfat frozen yoghurt.

05:04.958 --> 05:06.626
We're in a restaurant.
It's my restaurant.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.031
Ooh! How about
some sort of a

05:08.102 --> 05:10.320
Malaysian cuisine?
Burgers.

05:10.392 --> 05:11.859
How about, uh...

05:11.931 --> 05:13.482
burgers?

05:13.553 --> 05:15.453
Okay, burgers it is.
Thank you.

05:15.526 --> 05:16.826
Uh, fries, do they want fries?

05:16.914 --> 05:18.071
All right, Mickey, listen up.

05:18.101 --> 05:19.869
You want fries?

05:19.941 --> 05:22.242
Yeah, he wants fries... and a what?
And a what?

05:22.315 --> 05:23.715
Here, you take the order!
Oh, okay.

05:23.786 --> 05:25.153
Uh, Hi.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.842
Hi.
So, uh... b-burgers.

05:26.912 --> 05:29.164
How about cheese?
How many we doing with cheese?

05:29.237 --> 05:30.404
All right, who wants cheese?

05:30.474 --> 05:31.758
Huh, everyone.

05:31.828 --> 05:33.296
God, what do I want?

05:33.367 --> 05:34.968
I don't want cheese.

05:35.023 --> 05:36.290
Just scrape it off.

05:36.361 --> 05:37.928
Um... be-be-Bo,
be-be-booo.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.839
What does Mickey want?
Wh-What's your favourite?

05:39.904 --> 05:41.772
Well, the burger
of the day is, the, uh,

05:41.845 --> 05:43.579
"Chard to a Crisp" burger.

05:43.651 --> 05:45.835
What the hell is that?
Oh, it's, uh... uh,

05:45.908 --> 05:47.308
burger with Swiss chard on it.

05:47.379 --> 05:49.046
I was just having fun with it.

05:49.118 --> 05:50.418
Look at you,
Mr. Creative.

05:50.489 --> 05:51.789
No... a little bit.

05:51.860 --> 05:53.594
What was your name again?
Uh, Bob.

05:53.666 --> 05:55.967
Bob! What if you brought
the burgers over yourself?

05:56.041 --> 05:57.625
Uh...
Say yes. Say yes, Bob.

05:57.696 --> 05:59.463
Say it.
Please, I can't do that.

05:59.536 --> 06:01.270
O-Okay.
Okay, Bob's in.

06:01.341 --> 06:04.010
- Who needs these scumbag cops, right?
- Scum...

06:04.084 --> 06:05.317
Right?
Yeah.

06:05.388 --> 06:06.922
The cops are really...
Scumbags!

06:06.992 --> 06:08.860
Yeah. Well, no.
You can say it.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.067
Scrunched up faces
and their stupid arms...

06:11.140 --> 06:14.359
I'm gonna start
on those burgers, okay?

06:14.434 --> 06:16.735
Why do I need to wear this?

06:16.808 --> 06:18.108
'Cause you might get popped.

06:18.179 --> 06:20.213
I'm ready to be
the man of this family.

06:20.286 --> 06:21.653
I'm ready to call you dad, Gene.

06:21.723 --> 06:23.357
No one's calling Gene Dad.

06:23.429 --> 06:25.397
Gene / Dad! Time to go. Let's move.

06:25.470 --> 06:28.004
Remember, Bob,
he's hot, you stay cool.

06:28.078 --> 06:30.179
Hot. Cool.
What are you?!

06:30.251 --> 06:32.118
Um, Th-the guy with the hamburgers.
No, no, no.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.692
What are you, hot or cool?

06:33.762 --> 06:35.129
Cool... oh, cool.
You're ready.

06:35.201 --> 06:36.902
Okay. Come here,
come here, come here.

06:36.974 --> 06:38.941
Come back safe, Bobby. All right?
Let's go, Bob.

06:39.013 --> 06:40.914
I love you, Father!
I know.

06:40.987 --> 06:42.504
Bob, let's go.
Hold on one second...

06:42.575 --> 06:44.742
Bob. Yep. Dad, if you die,

06:44.815 --> 06:47.455
I'll have to write rort on Gene / Dad.
Timing is everything here, Bob.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.025
Let's go. No, if you die,
I'll write my report on you.

06:50.099 --> 06:51.891
Okay, enough, Bob. I'm coming.
I just got to finish up here.

06:51.921 --> 06:53.379
Let's go now!
Well, my family's saying good-bye.

06:53.409 --> 06:54.943
This is a precision operation.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.649
Dad, don't go!
Don't go!

06:56.721 --> 06:58.399
I've changed my mind!
Don't go, I love you!

06:58.429 --> 06:59.894
Gene, you got to let go of my arm.

06:59.964 --> 07:01.773
Dad, I love you. Please don't go!
Please don't go!

07:01.803 --> 07:03.471
Oh, my God! Get off.
I love you so much.

07:03.542 --> 07:05.543
I' be right there,
I've just got to wrap this up.

07:05.616 --> 07:07.117
Shake 'em loose,
Bob! Let's Go!

07:07.187 --> 07:08.771
I'm trying! They're
not letting me go!

07:08.843 --> 07:10.320
I have too many unanswered questions!

07:10.350 --> 07:11.748
What is sex?!

07:11.820 --> 07:14.838
Gene, just let go!
I don't know what sex is!

07:14.930 --> 07:16.347
I said, I'm coming!
Bob!

07:16.418 --> 07:18.018
Come back safe, Bobby.

07:18.090 --> 07:20.281
Don't leave me
with these friggin' kids.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.717
Okay, I'm going.

07:25.790 --> 07:27.057
Oh, crap.

07:27.128 --> 07:28.728
We don't have the logos on our bags.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.117
That's what's gonna be on camera.

07:30.147 --> 07:31.784
I'm on it.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.712
Why'd you draw at?
It's not a rocket. It's a fish.

07:34.786 --> 07:36.286
Okay. Why would
you draw a fish?

07:36.358 --> 07:38.092
It's easy to draw.

07:38.164 --> 07:40.098
So is a hamburger, or my name.

07:40.170 --> 07:41.270
Looks like a Jesus fish.

07:41.341 --> 07:42.541
Preachy.

07:42.612 --> 07:45.113
Let's go. Now.
Move it.

07:45.187 --> 07:47.355
It looks like a huge, misshapen penis.

07:47.427 --> 07:49.295
It's Bob's Burgers.

07:49.367 --> 07:52.335
It's supposed to be a fish,
not a rocket, or a penis.

07:52.410 --> 07:55.112
It's a penis.

07:57.827 --> 07:59.695
Oh, boy.

08:01.171 --> 08:03.372
Oh... God.

08:05.803 --> 08:07.437
Oh... no.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.446
Oh, boy.

08:11.605 --> 08:12.956
Oh, my God.

08:17.056 --> 08:18.990
Bob?
Yeah.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.330
Hey, you are Bob.

08:20.401 --> 08:21.868
You are definitely not a cop.

08:21.939 --> 08:24.073
Okay? Uh... thanks?

08:24.146 --> 08:26.907
Here are your burgers. Hey,
w-what are they saying about me out there?

08:26.937 --> 08:28.889
Uh, that you'd be, um, hot.

08:28.962 --> 08:30.763
Hot? Like Vin Diesel hot?

08:30.834 --> 08:32.802
N-No, like hot-tempered.

08:32.875 --> 08:35.376
Like a hot guy with a bad temper...
So, here's the burgers.

08:37.138 --> 08:38.705
Bobby!
How did you miss that?!

08:38.794 --> 08:40.059
Fatty got in the way.

08:40.131 --> 08:42.065
Uh, it's a code name we gave to Bob.

08:42.136 --> 08:44.105
You screwed up big-time
shooting at me!

08:44.178 --> 08:45.678
Maybe I'll shoot a hostage!

08:45.732 --> 08:46.849
Go ahead!
Do it, big man!

08:46.920 --> 08:48.387
Shoot a hostage!

08:48.457 --> 08:49.658
You shoot a hostage.

08:49.728 --> 08:50.862
Maybe I will!

08:50.933 --> 08:52.834
What is going on here?!

08:52.905 --> 08:55.056
You guys are trigger happy.
No, we're not!

08:55.129 --> 08:57.631
Are, too!

08:57.704 --> 09:00.273
What is wrong with
you people? Stop this!

09:00.346 --> 09:01.613
Who is this?
It's Bob.

09:01.684 --> 09:03.368
It's fatty.
Look, Bob,

09:03.440 --> 09:05.674
we're gonna get everyone
out of there safely, okay?

09:05.747 --> 09:07.081
I don't believe you!

09:07.151 --> 09:08.485
That was not on my orders.

09:08.557 --> 09:09.924
Someone just got a little hot.

09:09.995 --> 09:11.628
He's hot. We're cool.
Remember?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.651
We're cool.
We just shoot sometimes.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.190
Okay, this is ridiculous.

09:15.262 --> 09:16.629
I'm coming outside now.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.517
Do not shoot me!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:18.589 --> 09:20.907
If I let you go now, then
everyone will want to leave.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.847
And it's a big domino effect thing.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.321
Bob's a hostage now.
No. W-Wait, no.

09:25.394 --> 09:26.961
Hey, man, it's a really great group.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.768
Will you...
close those blinds?

09:29.842 --> 09:31.643
Maybe we should pass
those burgers around.

09:31.715 --> 09:33.116
My blood sugar is low.

09:33.186 --> 09:34.720
- I dropped them.
- What?!

09:34.791 --> 09:36.091
I was getting shot at.

09:36.162 --> 09:38.463
Drive through!

09:38.537 --> 09:40.738
That was gonna be
my red meat for the week.

09:40.811 --> 09:42.228
What am I gonna do for protein?

09:42.299 --> 09:44.033
I've got a protein bar in my pocket.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.772
You can fish it out.

09:45.844 --> 09:48.112
I am so glad you joined
the group, Bob.

09:48.184 --> 09:49.418
Oh, shut up, Frond.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.555
You guys know each other?

09:50.626 --> 09:51.926
What a coinky-dink.

09:51.997 --> 09:53.264
He works at my kids' school.

09:53.335 --> 09:55.036
We've had our...
We hate each other.

09:55.107 --> 09:56.908
What? Oh, this is gonna
be fun, you guys.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.380
He's taken Bob as a hostage.

09:58.451 --> 09:59.885
What?! This crazy!

09:59.956 --> 10:03.159
Yeah. Crazy good for my essay.

10:03.233 --> 10:04.667
Hello?
Hello.

10:04.739 --> 10:06.473
You're on with Bob's
youngest child, Louise.

10:06.545 --> 10:07.862
It's your daughter?
Oh!

10:07.932 --> 10:09.372
They work with me at the restaurant.

10:09.404 --> 10:11.037
Adorable.

10:11.109 --> 10:12.843
Yeah. Oh, no.
You're such a good father.

10:12.915 --> 10:14.753
It's more about not
paying regular... whatever.

10:14.783 --> 10:16.271
You want to talk to your Daddy?

10:16.343 --> 10:17.844
No. I want to
talk to you.

10:17.914 --> 10:19.949
You have been selected as the subject

10:20.021 --> 10:22.790
of my important person school essay.
Shut up.

10:22.864 --> 10:25.098
Oh, don't tell me to shut up!

10:25.171 --> 10:26.421
Question one...

10:26.492 --> 10:28.259
What... It's my Daddy!
Ah!

10:28.332 --> 10:30.967
How did you
first get into bank robbing?

10:31.041 --> 10:34.226
Pfft. Me and a buddy of mine,
we just kind of fell into it.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.792
You know, I had a gun,
I needed some money.

10:35.822 --> 10:37.380
All right, kiddo,
we've had our fun now.

10:37.410 --> 10:38.695
Hand over the...
It's my daddy!

10:38.765 --> 10:40.566
My daddy's in there!
Yeah! Okay!

10:40.638 --> 10:42.005
So just a couple more questions.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.743
I know you're a busy guy.

10:43.815 --> 10:46.096
Give me the phone.
Give me that phone back. Give it to me.

10:46.170 --> 10:47.570
You are being so rude right now.

10:47.641 --> 10:48.561
Ow!
Ouch!

10:48.631 --> 10:50.349
Serves you right, kid.
Listen to me, Mickey.

10:50.379 --> 10:51.786
We need to talk.
No, no, no.

10:51.841 --> 10:53.015
You know what,
I don't want to talk to you,

10:53.045 --> 10:54.402
I want to talk to the little girl.

10:54.432 --> 10:55.983
Negative.
You'll talk with me.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.813
It's the girl or, you know,
I shoot somebody,

10:57.843 --> 10:58.894
I kill somebody.

10:58.964 --> 11:00.464
All right.
Hang on. Hang on.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.070
Hi, um...

11:02.141 --> 11:04.709
Listen, Mickey,
you said you were a bank robber.

11:04.799 --> 11:06.000
Hey! I'm gonna
shoot somebody.

11:06.070 --> 11:07.988
Fine, here she is.
This is Louise.

11:08.061 --> 11:09.311
I'm running the show now.

11:09.382 --> 11:11.616
Bobby! I'm worried
about you.

11:11.689 --> 11:14.040
Who is this?
Hey, it's Linda.

11:14.113 --> 11:15.964
Linda, hi.
Who's this?

11:16.037 --> 11:17.337
This is Mickey.
I'm a criminal.

11:17.408 --> 11:18.992
Hey, Nicky.
How old are we?

11:19.062 --> 11:20.329
Don't worry about it.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.984
Ask about my money.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.773
Hey, Mickey, uh,
my sister Tina's worried

11:23.845 --> 11:25.329
about her bank account.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.385
I have $87 in that bank.

11:27.456 --> 11:29.324
I heard 200.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.033
And I have just withdrawn her
money for peace of mind, huh?

11:33.108 --> 11:36.477
Nice! I just brokered the
release of my sister's money.

11:36.553 --> 11:38.587
You haven't brokered jack!

11:38.659 --> 11:40.660
All right, here's how
we're gonna do this.

11:54.812 --> 11:57.114
Thank you!

11:57.186 --> 11:58.453
Hey, gimme that.

11:58.524 --> 12:00.708
No, no.
I need that for evidence.

12:00.781 --> 12:02.298
I will punch you.
And I will punch you!

12:02.328 --> 12:03.653
He will.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.408
I'm through playing games, Mickey!

12:05.479 --> 12:06.963
Uh, actually, it's Bob.

12:07.035 --> 12:08.719
Mickey wants me to handle
the calls now.

12:08.807 --> 12:10.641
Oh. Bob...
Yeah.

12:10.713 --> 12:12.898
All righisten, can Mickey hear this?
No. He's...

12:12.987 --> 12:14.425
behind the counter,
playing "banker."

12:14.455 --> 12:15.526
Oh, good, good, good.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.146
All right, now, listen very carefully.

12:17.218 --> 12:19.719
You are now my man on the inside.

12:19.793 --> 12:21.410
What? No.
No, no.

12:21.481 --> 12:23.520
I'm just the guy who brought
the burgers over, okay?

12:23.550 --> 12:25.022
No. Not anymore, Bob.

12:25.093 --> 12:26.393
You're more than a burger guy.

12:26.447 --> 12:28.246
Now, listen, whatever
you're doing at 6:00 pm,

12:28.276 --> 12:29.788
in exactly one hour,

12:29.859 --> 12:31.392
hit the deck.

12:31.464 --> 12:33.198
Hit the deck? What?
Hit the deck.

12:33.270 --> 12:34.908
You've never heard
that expression before?

12:34.938 --> 12:36.776
Yeah. I said "what"?
Were you in the navy?

12:36.848 --> 12:38.315
No, I was not in the navy.

12:38.350 --> 12:40.028
Were you? Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I was.

12:40.058 --> 12:42.452
But I don't want to go through
my military history right now.

12:42.482 --> 12:43.991
"Hit the deck" means get down.
Well, you don't have to be

12:44.021 --> 12:45.461
in the navy to know that expression.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.491
Just focus. Spread the word
to the other hostages.

12:47.521 --> 12:51.269
At 6:00, on the dot,
hit the deck.

12:51.345 --> 12:53.279
Wait, no. Listen,
don't do that.

12:53.351 --> 12:55.286
Everything all right, Bob?
Yeah, uh, no.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.917
Everything's fine, yeah.
I just had a cramp.

12:56.947 --> 12:58.847
Oh, good. Then get
over here and play banker.

12:58.919 --> 13:00.019
Come on, get in on this.

13:00.090 --> 13:00.856
Yay.

13:00.926 --> 13:01.859
You got a 50?

13:01.929 --> 13:03.096
Come on, I can break a 50.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.034
Um, I got a five.

13:05.106 --> 13:06.006
All right.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.543
Let's break Bob's five.

13:07.614 --> 13:09.949
One, two, three, four, five.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.456
We broke your five!
Thank you.

13:11.527 --> 13:14.012
That was fun.
You got five singles now.

13:17.268 --> 13:19.586
Olsen Benner here reporting
from the hostage standoff,

13:19.660 --> 13:20.977
where tensions are high.

13:21.047 --> 13:22.581
I understand your husband is

13:22.653 --> 13:24.554
one of the hostages inside the bank.

13:24.626 --> 13:26.860
Yes. Bobby, if
you're listening,

13:26.933 --> 13:28.133
we love you, baby.

13:28.204 --> 13:29.738
If you make it out of there,

13:29.809 --> 13:32.428
I will do anything, anything you want.

13:32.501 --> 13:33.635
Except that one thing.

13:33.705 --> 13:35.222
Us, too, Bobby.
Anything.

13:35.277 --> 13:36.894
Most things, Bobby.

13:36.966 --> 13:38.783
All right, Mickey,
you-you have to give up.

13:38.855 --> 13:40.923
You-you have to end this
before someone gets hurt.

13:40.996 --> 13:43.330
I have a plan, Bob, okay?

13:43.403 --> 13:45.437
This is gonna go fine.
I can help.

13:45.510 --> 13:47.594
I am a self-certified counsellor,
after all.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.201
You want money, okay.

13:49.272 --> 13:51.306
The cops want to kill you, sure.

13:51.362 --> 13:53.480
You have a gun and might kill us.

13:53.536 --> 13:55.203
I am freaking out!

13:55.275 --> 13:56.575
What is your plan?!

13:56.646 --> 13:58.781
All right, I don't have a plan, okay?!

13:58.853 --> 14:01.055
This is the first bank
I've ever robbed by myself,

14:01.127 --> 14:02.127
without Rodney.

14:02.164 --> 14:03.097
Oh, truth comes out.

14:03.167 --> 14:04.767
Rodney was the brains

14:04.839 --> 14:06.673
and you were the dead weight,
I'm guessing.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.779
Why the hell would you
do a job without Rodney?!

14:08.852 --> 14:10.286
You stupid idiot!

14:10.358 --> 14:11.558
Mr. Frond, shut up.

14:11.627 --> 14:13.345
He's right, I'm so stupid.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.716
No. I'm nothing without Rodney.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.305
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.211
Okay. All right,
come here, come here.

14:18.282 --> 14:19.316
Sit down.

14:20.423 --> 14:21.490
Hello?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.094
Dad, I need to talk to Mickey.

14:23.165 --> 14:25.566
It's an emergency;
My report's due on Monday.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.318
Louise, please.
I'm in a hostage situation.

14:27.348 --> 14:28.179
People could die.

14:28.249 --> 14:29.699
Ugh, I just want to know

14:29.769 --> 14:31.370
what the nuttiest thing
he ever stole is?

14:31.442 --> 14:33.043
Bob, this is Linda.

14:33.115 --> 14:35.616
I don't know if you saw
what I said to you on TV...

14:35.689 --> 14:37.123
What did you say?
Anything.

14:37.194 --> 14:39.262
That's what I'll do for you
if you get out.

14:39.335 --> 14:41.803
Everything's on the table,
including on the table.

14:41.876 --> 14:43.510
Lin, Lin, stop.
I have to go.

14:43.581 --> 14:45.983
Dad, I just remembered, I
have an account there, too,

14:46.056 --> 14:47.724
and a safety deposit box.

14:47.795 --> 14:50.764
So I have about, I think a
thousand, and then I just have,

14:50.838 --> 14:53.840
like, a lot of valuables
in the safety deposit box.

14:53.915 --> 14:55.315
I'm sending the robot.

14:55.387 --> 14:57.288
How many extensions
do you people have?!

14:57.359 --> 14:58.639
Four. All right, I'm hanging up.

15:01.674 --> 15:04.809
Mickey, listen, we-we got to
start making moves here, okay?

15:04.884 --> 15:06.184
What if... hear me out...

15:06.255 --> 15:07.772
What if you release
all the hostages...

15:07.802 --> 15:09.210
Ah. Yeah.
No.

15:09.282 --> 15:10.282
You leave the money.

15:10.351 --> 15:11.118
Sure. Sure.
No.

15:11.187 --> 15:12.588
You give yourself up.

15:12.659 --> 15:13.992
Why not?
Why would I do that?

15:14.063 --> 15:15.363
Almost as good as

15:15.435 --> 15:16.902
your "what is past
due?" argument.

15:16.973 --> 15:19.308
Look, I want to talk to Rodney.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.982
Rodney, phone's for you!

15:22.056 --> 15:24.007
Hello?

15:24.079 --> 15:25.129
Rodney?
Mickey!

15:25.199 --> 15:26.199
Hey, what's up?

15:26.236 --> 15:27.920
Oh, not much.

15:27.992 --> 15:29.526
Uh, I botched a job, man.

15:29.597 --> 15:31.264
The cops are everywhere.
What do I do?

15:31.336 --> 15:32.770
Are there cops on the phone?

15:32.841 --> 15:34.308
Yeah, but I'm whispering.

15:34.363 --> 15:35.881
Yeah, we can't hear anything.
Go ahead.

15:35.911 --> 15:37.285
See?
Oh, man.

15:37.356 --> 15:39.073
Rodney.
Who the hell is that?

15:39.145 --> 15:42.047
Oh, just a little girl who's
writing a paper about me.

15:42.121 --> 15:43.604
When you two were working together,

15:43.676 --> 15:45.444
what was the first thing you would buy

15:45.515 --> 15:46.882
after you stole all that money?

15:46.953 --> 15:48.631
You know, I love me
a Cadbury egg, but I...

15:48.661 --> 15:50.159
That's my Rodney.

15:50.231 --> 15:51.949
Hey, Mickey, I don't know
what you're up to,

15:51.979 --> 15:53.070
but count me out.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.908
Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!

15:55.983 --> 15:57.817
Easy, Mickey, calm down.

15:57.889 --> 15:59.623
Ah! Let me
out of here!

15:59.695 --> 16:01.412
Women and children should be released.

16:01.484 --> 16:02.818
You're not a woman, Frond.

16:02.888 --> 16:04.355
I will tuck my junk so fast.

16:04.426 --> 16:05.760
Look, I'm losing it, Bob.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.499
Maybe I should make a break for it.

16:07.571 --> 16:09.649
Mickey, look, you're not
getting away with the money.

16:09.679 --> 16:10.777
You have to accept that.

16:10.848 --> 16:12.281
I-I just don't think
Rodney would...

16:12.352 --> 16:14.271
You got to stop thinking
about Rodney, all right?

16:14.301 --> 16:15.493
You robbed this bank.

16:15.562 --> 16:17.764
So you need to decide how this ends,

16:17.837 --> 16:19.571
not how Rodney would do it.

16:19.643 --> 16:21.911
It's how Mickey would do
it. Do the Mickey plan.

16:21.984 --> 16:23.751
I don't know what
the Mickey plan is though.

16:23.823 --> 16:26.658
I just don't want to look like
a total failure on TV.

16:26.733 --> 16:29.368
Cops touching my hair, laughing at me,

16:29.441 --> 16:31.693
pulling on me,
grabbing m-m-my new jeans.

16:31.765 --> 16:33.166
All right, all right.

16:33.237 --> 16:35.822
So give yourself up,
but on your R term.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.447
Look, I don't make a lot
of money selling burgers,

16:38.520 --> 16:40.738
- Mm-mm.
- But I do it on my terms.

16:40.828 --> 16:42.028
Mm, okay.

16:42.082 --> 16:43.933
All right, I'll turn myself in.

16:44.005 --> 16:45.005
On my terms.

16:45.075 --> 16:46.593
And here's one of my terms.

16:46.663 --> 16:47.864
I'm hungry!

16:47.934 --> 16:50.786
I want one of your burgers, Bob.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.402
Baby steps, baby steps, baby steps.

16:55.475 --> 16:57.944
That's right,
the hostage situation

16:58.017 --> 17:00.385
is moving to Fish Rocket Burgers.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.063
Say we go to your place,

17:03.117 --> 17:04.867
order up some burgers,
I give myself up,

17:04.939 --> 17:06.439
on my terms.

17:06.494 --> 17:07.778
How you like my plan, Bob?

17:07.832 --> 17:09.583
Uh, it's not great.
Pretty sweet?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.923
Uh, I think it's fair at best, Mickey,

17:11.989 --> 17:12.984
but it's yours.

17:13.015 --> 17:14.464
It sure is mine.

17:14.521 --> 17:15.895
Hey, what are you guys
doing after this?

17:15.925 --> 17:17.224
I mean, not that I can come.

17:17.296 --> 17:18.403
Probably not.
I mean, maybe I can.

17:18.433 --> 17:19.782
Hey, you guys are shoe twins!

17:19.838 --> 17:20.954
Look at your shoes.

17:25.205 --> 17:26.204
Easy.

17:26.233 --> 17:27.934
You're almost home, Bobby!

17:28.006 --> 17:30.074
Oh, God, now I have to do that.

17:30.146 --> 17:32.882
Bobby, I'll trade you that
for two of the other things.

17:32.955 --> 17:34.656
Hey, hey, look at that.
That's my ride.

17:34.728 --> 17:36.245
Gets great ass mileage.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.634
How are you still single?

17:37.704 --> 17:38.754
I'm not.

17:38.841 --> 17:39.607
Oops.

17:39.677 --> 17:41.211
Hey!

17:41.283 --> 17:42.950
All right, we're out
of the restaurant.

17:43.022 --> 17:45.790
I just don't get why we have
to be in a huddle, too.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.364
So you don't fan out.

17:47.436 --> 17:49.837
Plus, we're in a huddle,
and it just feels like

17:49.910 --> 17:51.630
it should be, you know,
like a huddle thing.

17:51.683 --> 17:53.050
Pretty tight though.
Looking good.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.322
Hey, I see you!

17:55.394 --> 17:56.595
Get in the bank or, you know,

17:56.665 --> 17:57.498
I start shooting!
Ah!

17:57.568 --> 17:58.969
Okay, okay! We're going.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.918
See that? Yeah, this is
how you go out in style.

18:00.948 --> 18:02.213
The Mickey way.

18:02.283 --> 18:04.163
Mickey! What advice
would you give young people?

18:04.223 --> 18:05.440
Who's your hero?

18:05.511 --> 18:06.828
What's your favourite
pig-out food?

18:06.858 --> 18:08.299
Stay in school, Superman,

18:08.371 --> 18:10.169
potato chips if I'm sad,
chocolate if I'm bad.

18:10.199 --> 18:12.728
Louise, get out!

18:12.801 --> 18:15.252
You guys are amazing.

18:15.326 --> 18:17.027
Best human shields ever.

18:17.098 --> 18:18.816
Whoa, look out!
Just kidding.

18:18.887 --> 18:19.937
Oh, my God, no, look out!

18:20.008 --> 18:21.442
I'm kidding.

18:21.513 --> 18:22.780
These burgers are good.

18:22.850 --> 18:25.018
This is great, huh?
Look at me.

18:25.091 --> 18:26.958
Burger in one hand,
beer in the other...

18:27.030 --> 18:28.130
Living life.

18:28.201 --> 18:30.035
This is how you go to jail.

18:30.107 --> 18:31.774
Yeah, and no one got hurt.

18:31.846 --> 18:33.413
Well, that, too. That, too.

18:33.485 --> 18:35.545
Hey, Bob, you know when
they, uh, caught up to Rodney,

18:35.575 --> 18:37.535
they tackled him, and his pants
came halfway down.

18:37.581 --> 18:39.816
He's splayed out like that,
with his hands on his head,

18:39.889 --> 18:41.456
ass in the breeze.

18:41.544 --> 18:43.862
It's like his pants
just kind of gave up.

18:43.935 --> 18:45.502
My pants are staying on.

18:45.574 --> 18:47.091
So thanks for that, Bob.

18:47.163 --> 18:48.230
Thanks for everything.

18:48.299 --> 18:50.134
Uh, sure, Mickey.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.618
The cops tear-gassed themselves.

19:05.672 --> 19:06.873
Love it!

19:06.943 --> 19:08.043
Oh, well done.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.048
That's the money shot. Goodie.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.535
Ow, man, not my Sex-U-V!

19:16.608 --> 19:17.441
All right, now's my chance.

19:17.511 --> 19:18.411
N-No, Mickey,

19:18.481 --> 19:19.481
don't do it.

19:19.517 --> 19:20.584
Sorry to eat and run.

19:20.655 --> 19:21.655
Was that a cool line?

19:21.724 --> 19:23.458
Mm, not really.

19:23.530 --> 19:28.150
No...!

19:28.229 --> 19:29.913
Yes...!

19:30.002 --> 19:32.253
Run, Mickey!

19:40.252 --> 19:43.170
Not the pants...!

19:46.287 --> 19:47.354
You see that, Bob?

19:47.425 --> 19:48.992
My pants are up! Ow!

19:49.063 --> 19:50.260
They're up!
Yeah, I see, buddy.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.367
I see it.

19:51.438 --> 19:52.471
Dad!

19:52.541 --> 19:54.008
You survived!
I did.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.413
Oh, Bobby, you're a hero.

19:55.484 --> 19:56.985
I don't know about that.

19:57.361 --> 19:58.812
You really stepped up today.

19:58.899 --> 20:00.350
Maybe I was wrong about you, Bob.

20:00.421 --> 20:01.888
Come by the bank tomorrow

20:01.959 --> 20:03.893
and we'll see about
restructuring your loans.

20:03.966 --> 20:05.100
What the...?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.138
That's a dye pack from the bank.

20:07.210 --> 20:08.968
Uh, Mickey must have put it...
Tsk-tsk-tsk...

20:08.998 --> 20:10.149
Oh, don't tsk me.

20:10.220 --> 20:11.787
I didn't...
Mm-mm.

20:11.859 --> 20:13.202
Oh, come...
Nope.

20:13.325 --> 20:14.614
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

20:14.737 --> 20:16.249
Didn't know you had it in you, Dad.

20:16.373 --> 20:17.475
I didn't steal the money.

20:17.597 --> 20:19.144
I believe you, honey.

20:19.215 --> 20:20.549
Kinda.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.956
Hey, Bob, why don't you go negotiate

20:25.028 --> 20:26.996
the release of some
tomatoes from the walk-in?

20:27.068 --> 20:28.237
It's been two weeks, Lin.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.073
You can stop with the hostage jokes.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.148
Bob's Burgers.

20:32.185 --> 20:33.585
Bob! It's Mickey!

20:33.656 --> 20:35.623
Hey, Mickey, how-how's jail?

20:35.696 --> 20:37.397
It's horrible.
Ask him if he got

20:37.469 --> 20:38.669
the books on tape we sent him.

20:38.706 --> 20:40.307
Does anyone there need a pen pal?

20:40.378 --> 20:42.313
Ask him what he'll do
for a pack of smokes.

20:42.437 --> 20:44.152
Hey, Bob, I wanted to know what grade

20:44.224 --> 20:45.822
your daughter got
on that essay about me?

20:45.852 --> 20:47.430
Oh. Um, he
wants to know

20:47.501 --> 20:49.502
what grade you got on
that essay you wrote.

20:49.574 --> 20:51.342
Oh. I never even
turned it in.

20:51.413 --> 20:52.347
Right.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.107
Uh, she got an A.

20:54.231 --> 20:57.199
Hey, we got an A!
