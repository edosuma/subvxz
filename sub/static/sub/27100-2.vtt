WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.240
Two minutes, five seconds.
Best time yet.

00:03.240 --> 00:04.480
That jump - wow!

00:04.480 --> 00:08.640
There has to be a reason for us to
be the ones with magic, with powers.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.160
Heath Buckland. Zara Bello.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.960
Your...tutor?

00:13.960 --> 00:16.920
Your Mum did tell
you about me, right?

00:16.920 --> 00:20.000
You'll need a consent form
signed by a parent.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.200
Wow, we could make state. Incredible.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.480
337 hits.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.320
You're actually a good songwriter.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.440
Thanks, Heath.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.400
Could have just been
a bad dream.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.000
Ben had a premonition.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.760
Think it was some kind of attack.
They certainly felt hostile.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.040
Run!

00:42.400 --> 00:44.440
It's just like training, OK?
Luke!

00:45.360 --> 00:46.720
Protection spell now!

00:46.720 --> 00:48.960
Aid in my quest,
I call you forth!

00:53.080 --> 00:55.160
Just another sleepy Monday
in Bremin, then.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.640 --> 01:45.560
Well, that was more
after-school drama than I care for.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.720
So...black snaky things. That's new.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.800
Yeah, what do they want?

01:52.800 --> 01:54.960
They seemed pretty excited
about attacking me.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.200
No, they attacked all of us,
except Ben.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.480
But don't take it personally.
Now do you all get it?

01:59.480 --> 02:02.600
This is the exactly the type
of threat I was talking about.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.160
What do you mean?
We just smashed them.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.240
Um, what if there's more?

02:06.240 --> 02:07.520
Or they come back?

02:07.520 --> 02:08.639
I'll start researching.

02:08.639 --> 02:09.880
See if I can find anything.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.760
Yeah, the rest of us
can meet at my place.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.880
Can't. I've got to
help cook dinner tonight.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.280
Yeah, I'm out too.
I've got tutoring.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.280
Do any of you take this seriously?

02:18.280 --> 02:21.640
Uh, you two are the magic buffs.
You'll figure it out.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.720
Fine.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.360
Lair, first thing tomorrow, then.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.840
Why is it always first thing?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.000
Can't it be second thing?

02:29.440 --> 02:31.600
What? "You suck, gayby!"

02:33.200 --> 02:34.200
What is it?

02:35.120 --> 02:36.680
Oh, you know how it is.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.240
The fans always want a piece of you.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.520
547 hits.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.840
But who's counting?

02:51.840 --> 02:54.800
So not obsessed.
Me obsessed? What about Luke?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.200
We did just fight off an attack.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.600
Yeah, no, exactly.
We said, "Go," and it's gone.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.200
They could be back.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.160
OK, if one pops up,
we hit it with the protection spell.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.640
How long do you expect that to work?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.520
Mm-mm!
I've gotta go.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.160
Yeah, someone has to study.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.800
Study's my new thing.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.480
Who knows, I might even
open the book this time.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.160
That new tutor must be working.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.960
Zara says she has strategies
for my dyslexia.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.280
Yeah, it's all about her strategies.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.480
Shut up. It is.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.520
See you.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.640
What is with her?

03:35.480 --> 03:36.760
Seriously?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.720
I mean, study all you like,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.960
but you're still as dumb
as my Year 7 wardrobe.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.480
My face?

03:50.600 --> 03:51.840
What's up?

03:51.840 --> 03:52.840
Nothing.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.240
It's obviously something.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.480
Price of fame.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.040
Am I supposed to keep asking, or can
I go now, 'cause I really have to...

03:59.040 --> 04:01.400
No, no - study. Yeah.
Yeah, I have... Yeah.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.840
Good talk.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.960
Hello!

04:17.760 --> 04:21.240
Ah, good. You're home.
You can start on the potatoes.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.440
Form for you to sign.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.440
What is it?

04:23.440 --> 04:24.840
Trying out for the state team.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.120
Oh. When did this happen?

04:27.120 --> 04:29.520
Um, well the coach thinks
I've got a good shot at making it.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.400
Oh, I'm sure you do, but...
But what?

04:32.400 --> 04:33.880
You know, I don't need to tell you

04:33.880 --> 04:35.800
that Year 11 requires
a lot more focus.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.760
Is this the right time
to be taking this on?

04:37.760 --> 04:39.960
It'll be fine. I can handle it.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.640
Here.
Well, just leave it there.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.680
I'll think about it.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.920
I need it signed before training.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.480
Well, I'll talk to your father
about it.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.640
When?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.320
When he gets home.
And when will that be?

04:50.320 --> 04:52.440
Well, your guess is as good as mine.
He's never home.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.080
Nicco!
Fine.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.360
Zara.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.920
You're way early.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.760
Did I get the time wrong?

05:10.760 --> 05:13.400
I thought it might be nice for Zara
to join us for dinner.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.840
And what did Zara think?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.640
She's been polite enough
to play along.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.040
Well, yes - that's because
my mum raised me well.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.920
Uh...looks...interesting.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.320
Welcome to the dark side.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.840
I wish I could have protected you
from what's about to happen.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.640
Heath, I need some help.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.480
What are you doing?
I'm setting the table.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.440
Why? It's not Christmas.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.920
Because we've got company.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.320
Yeah, my tutor.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.080
Don't you like her?

05:51.520 --> 05:52.880
Mum!

05:52.880 --> 05:55.000
Look, we'll just have a nice dinner
and get to know each other,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.520
and then...I'll get out of your hair
and the two of you can...study.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.760
OK, now you're sort
of weirding me out.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.840
Oh, it's not weird.
I'm taking an interest.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.320
Sorry, I was looking for salt?

06:06.320 --> 06:07.880
We've only got chicken salt.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.920
Oh, but there's no
actual chicken in it.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.080
Heath told me
that you're a vegetarian.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.320
He did?

06:14.440 --> 06:15.720
Mmm.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.760
Your mum's nice.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.120
Is she?

06:20.120 --> 06:23.600
Well, she's a terrible cook,
but she's really nice.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.400
Mmm, most mums, you taste the love
in their cooking.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.080
My mum, you just taste whatever
got burnt at the bottom of the pot.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.520
That's what it was?

06:31.640 --> 06:33.320
I'll remember that for next time.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
Next time?

06:37.080 --> 06:38.520
Let's get started.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.080
"You look like
your face caught fire,

06:41.080 --> 06:43.120
"then someone
put it out with a fork."

06:43.120 --> 06:45.080
Oh, well - haters gonna hate.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.800
Can you please not
quote Taylor to me?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.040
This is a disaster
and I'm not gonna shake it off.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.520
Oh, great, now I have an earworm.
Thanks!

06:54.520 --> 06:55.840
Well, what are a few bad comments

06:55.840 --> 06:58.280
when you've got, what,
a bazillion positive ones?

06:58.280 --> 07:00.280
Still thirty people who hate me.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.960
They don't matter.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.040
Ignore them.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.240
Easy to say.
And to do.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.240
Come on, turn it off.
Dinner's nearly ready.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.400
Come on.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.200
And maybe you should consider
going offline for a bit.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.360
"What a hack."

07:17.640 --> 07:19.200
Jesse, put it down!

07:30.920 --> 07:33.400
There's zero
about dark snake-like things.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.880
Have you heard of nematodes?

07:35.440 --> 07:37.720
Nema-what?
Todes.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.000
It's a kind of parasite.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.720
There are over 5,000
different species.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.680
So that's what attacked us?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.440
No. Actual nematodes are tiny.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.520
A few millimetres long at best.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.520
What we saw was more like a,
um...like a paranormal nematode.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.000
OK...

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But it behaved like a nematode.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.600
You saw how it seemed
to feed on magic.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.920
It's definitely a parasite.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.640
It did only attack us
whenever we used our powers.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.360
Which means...

08:05.360 --> 08:07.960
We don't use our powers
until we figure this out.

08:08.760 --> 08:09.760
Yeah.

08:09.760 --> 08:10.760
I'll text the others.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.880
Hey, get up!

09:54.400 --> 09:55.920
Jesse, come on!

09:55.920 --> 09:56.960
Jesse!

09:57.920 --> 09:59.520
Didn't your alarm go off?

09:59.520 --> 10:00.760
No. Uh...

10:01.200 --> 10:02.880
I've got
an early Pilates class, OK?

10:02.880 --> 10:05.160
So if you want a lift,
I'm leaving in five minutes.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.160
Yeah, I'm up!

10:13.400 --> 10:15.880
I will not let negativity
control my life.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.440
I will live the life
that I can imagine.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.880
Be positive
and positivity will flow.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.880
And I will not look at my phone.
Nup, not even a peek.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.240
Positive Jesse wins the day.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.240
Four minutes!
OK!

10:31.240 --> 10:33.040
OK! Jeez!

10:35.160 --> 10:36.960
Do
you know anything about this?

10:36.960 --> 10:38.160
About what?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.640
Somebody left the freezer open.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.640
It wasn't me.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.840
I'm not the one who sneaks ice-cream
in the middle of the night.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.720
Half this food is going to go off.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.280
Um, you didn't sign it?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.720
We haven't talked about it yet.
Your father's in the shower.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.480
Well, I have to go. I'm late.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.520
Well, what time is it?
Tryouts are now.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.000
Oh. You didn't mention that.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.760
This is important.
It's the state team.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.000
Does that mean you'd move out?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.160
We'll look at the form tonight.
So I could have your room.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.480
You know what football means to me.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.920
Oh, I get it.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.760
But this is a big commitment, OK?

11:04.760 --> 11:05.960
Remember what happened last year

11:05.960 --> 11:07.400
when you put yourself
under pressure?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.080
Oh, are you ever going
to forget about that?

11:09.080 --> 11:10.240
It's just...
Niccolina.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.000
If I get in,
we can think about it then, OK?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.600
I will not be pressured into this.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.200
But if you just...
We'll discuss this tonight.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.640
Fine!

11:21.080 --> 11:22.160
Thanks a bunch!

11:26.000 --> 11:27.880
I thought you were in a hurry!

11:35.720 --> 11:37.840
Oh, where's the product
when you need it?

11:58.600 --> 11:59.840
Sorry!

11:59.840 --> 12:01.160
Sorry, wrong leggings.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.920
Pilates is all about
the activewear.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.600
Thank you.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.720
I can...
No. Sorry, not gonna happen.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.880
Hey, Quinn, can you let me
drive just, like, once?

12:12.880 --> 12:14.520
Not in this car, buddy.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.680
Hey, you know...you know, if
Mum and Dad were here, they'd let me.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.120
I'm a good driver.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.960
Couldn't we have met in the quad
at lunch like normal people?

12:37.960 --> 12:39.200
Where's Nicco?

12:39.200 --> 12:43.240
I want to say she's not an early
morning person, but she totally is.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.560
I had a dream last night.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.000
More of a vision, I think.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.280
Why didn't you tell me?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.400
I wasn't sure.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.160
Was it a nematode?
A what?

12:54.160 --> 12:55.240
A nematode.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.880
We all have bad dreams.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.960
Mine usually involves
a zombie pelican.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.880
It's a lot more frightening
than it sounds.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.040
I saw the nematode.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.560
And it felt real.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.760
And it was much, much bigger.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.400
It works like a parasite.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.880
It feeds on magic.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.120
So the message
for us not to use our powers,

13:16.120 --> 13:17.600
that was because of a dream?

13:17.600 --> 13:18.680
What message?

13:19.360 --> 13:21.000
I texted you last night.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.360
Sorry. I needed a little tech detox.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.400
I'll turn this on, yeah?

13:26.320 --> 13:28.920
Sorry.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.440
Up to date now. All good.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.320
Tell me you didn't.
Just a little bit.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.360
I...I had a hairtastrophe.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.880
You had a what?

13:42.520 --> 13:44.320
Yes, but nothing happened.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.360
So I'm sorry, your theory is a bust.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.200
There wasn't a nema...
Tode!

13:49.200 --> 13:51.080
Yeah, that - in sight.
Jesse.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.120
No powers, got it.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.560
And you all have to be ready with
the protection spell, just in case.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.080
Which we can't do without Nicco.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.120
I'm on it.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.840
This morning's all about
who stays and who goes.

14:04.840 --> 14:10.760
So the most important question is
are you ready to be the best?

14:10.760 --> 14:11.880
Yes!

14:11.880 --> 14:13.160
I said, are you ready?

14:13.160 --> 14:14.680
Yes!
Good!

14:14.680 --> 14:16.800
Warm-up lap around the oval.
Let's go.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.200
Nicco, stop.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.520
I need your consent form.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.080
No form, no tryout.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.120
Can't I just give...

14:22.120 --> 14:24.600
Uh, are you serious about this
or not?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.160
It's in my bag.
Well, go get it.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.480
Come on, Nicco - what's the delay?

14:47.240 --> 14:48.440
OK, good. Go!

14:48.440 --> 14:49.520
Thanks, Kayla.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.040
And Heath says hi.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.240
No, I don't.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.680
Nicco's at training.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.040
Since when did she start
having morning training?

14:56.040 --> 14:58.560
Since when did you know her schedule
off by heart?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.480
"Totally lame."

15:05.200 --> 15:07.000
What are you doing?!

15:07.000 --> 15:09.440
Oh, sorry. I just...
You need to get it together, Jesse.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.560
Sorry, I forgot.
Oh, great.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.200
Hey, look,
it's attracted to the water.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.880
Looks like it's a fan of my moves.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.400
OK, well, keep it busy.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.760
That's it - follow the water.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.760
This will keep it occupied.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.400
Did you see the latest comments?
I'm trying not to look.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.800
Do you hear that?
Hear what?

15:32.760 --> 15:33.840
Never mind.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.200
This is so wrong on so many levels.
You have to reply!

15:37.200 --> 15:38.520
What?
No, that's the worst thing to do.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.240
Well, we have to stand up to them.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.760
We? It's me they're attacking.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.480
If they attack you, they attack me.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.760
We stand together.
You stand. I need a good lie-down.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.240
Look, we can't just let them
get away with hate speech.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.720
You know,
this is the 21st century...

15:50.720 --> 15:52.000
Just leave it.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.960
Later.
What? Jesse!

15:53.960 --> 15:55.160
Ellen!

15:55.160 --> 15:57.480
What is this thing?
Details now.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.200
It's a paranormal nematode.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.560
Like the parasite?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.520
From what we know,
they seem to feed on magic.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.560
Ring any bells?

16:04.680 --> 16:06.760
I've never seen anything like it.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.360
One attacked us yesterday
and another turned up today.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.240
What are they doing at the school?

16:11.240 --> 16:12.360
Did they follow you here?

16:13.440 --> 16:16.080
Someone couldn't help themselves.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.160
One little mistake.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.760
But I'm keeping it busy.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.520
Well, if they feed on magic,

16:21.520 --> 16:23.680
it would make sense
that they would come to the school.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.120
To get an education?

16:25.120 --> 16:26.840
Because of the ley lines.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.040
Ley lines?

16:28.040 --> 16:30.200
Ancient lines of magic energy
that cross the world.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.160
The ley lines cross at three points
in Bremin -

16:34.160 --> 16:36.800
the forest, an old warehouse
and here at school.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.200
Alright, is that good or bad?

16:38.200 --> 16:40.560
The intersections
are like magic hotspots.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.720
OK, maybe they...
draw power from them.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.800
In my vision,
the nematode got bigger.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.120
More powerful, like it was evolving.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.200
Then we've got a problem.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.520
This one is at the ,lair right here.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.840
So they're going to keep coming.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.640
What if we stopped them
with a binding spell?

16:55.640 --> 16:58.200
And then use a banish spell
to send them out of the world?

16:58.200 --> 16:59.360
And how do we do that?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.320
We put two spells together.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.960
Make a bind and banish spell.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.319
Could work.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.560
I think what we need is in here.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.839
Can we hurry up?
Ah-ha.

17:09.839 --> 17:11.079
That works for me.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.640
Unless anyone else
has a better idea.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.800
Just get it out of here
before people see it.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.200
You two work on the spell.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.880
The rest of us
will get it away from the school.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.599
So much for keeping it busy!
I told you to hurry.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.960
Look, OK, let's spread out.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.640
First one to spot it,
call the others.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.960
OK, come on.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.160
I'll keep watch.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.760
Alright, alright, stand back.
Stand back.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.320
The fire alarm has sounded.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.160
Could everyone please
go to the oval? Thanks.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.960
Oh, no.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.400
Mr Bates?

19:34.880 --> 19:36.200
Mr Bates?

19:36.200 --> 19:37.280
Stay back, Jesse.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.800
Hmm?

19:51.480 --> 19:52.680
Ooh!

20:01.160 --> 20:02.920
What? But...

20:08.800 --> 20:10.120
Oh...

20:10.120 --> 20:11.440
How did this even happen?

20:11.440 --> 20:12.880
I only looked away for a minute.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.520
You had one job, Jesse!

20:14.520 --> 20:16.800
Bates is going to find everything.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
He has all our stuff,
all our books.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.880
Not all of them.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.000
Can you make
the bind and banish spell from that?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Already have.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.760
I'll do some damage control.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.200
Teacher to teacher.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.000
- Thanks heaps, Jesse.
- Nice work.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.560
Do you think it's...

20:37.880 --> 20:39.960
..safe to be in here?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.720
Maybe we should wait
for the fire department.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.080
What is this place?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.960
What have people been doing in here?

20:49.960 --> 20:52.400
It's probably just a bunch
of kids mucking around.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.480
No, this is a secret room

20:54.480 --> 20:57.680
where students have been doing
who knows what?

20:57.680 --> 21:00.040
Whoever's behind this has
some serious questions to answer.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.200
Like a dog with a bone.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.720
This is a disaster.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.600
I know, OK?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.160
There's still a way out of this.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.800
We draw it to the back of the lair,
do the spell there.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.800
Yeah, while everyone's on the oval.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.040
Yep.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.840
Elements in.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.200
The trick is to keep both spells
going at the same time.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.360
Are you sure you should be
messing with a banish spell?

21:42.360 --> 21:43.600
Yeah - again?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.200
I'll keep watch.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.400
If this doesn't work...

21:48.400 --> 21:49.840
Why so negative?

21:49.840 --> 21:51.480
All clear.
OK.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.560
Elements that knit and bind

21:54.560 --> 21:57.320
Hear my will, join different kinds

21:57.320 --> 21:59.960
Fire, water, earth and air

21:59.960 --> 22:01.480
Together as one

22:01.480 --> 22:03.080
Bound and shared.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.720
Did anything happen?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.600
Huh? Who's there?

22:22.880 --> 22:25.480
- I don't think it's...
Wait - it worked.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.360
What? They've changed?

22:29.840 --> 22:31.760
They've brought some friends!

22:31.760 --> 22:33.160
Just like the ones in my dream!

22:34.120 --> 22:35.680
The binding spell should still work!

22:35.680 --> 22:38.240
Fire, water, earth and air

22:38.240 --> 22:39.880
Together as one

22:39.880 --> 22:41.200
Bound and shared.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.280
Now part two!

22:45.280 --> 22:48.160
Divinity of the elements,
come what may

22:48.160 --> 22:50.360
Lead you places far away

22:50.360 --> 22:52.880
Earth, fire, water, air

22:52.880 --> 22:55.280
Banish those who've done me harm

22:55.280 --> 22:57.560
From this world, they be gone!

22:57.560 --> 22:59.080
Come on, come on, come on!

23:01.520 --> 23:03.760
The portal's breaking down. Hurry!
Yeah, why is it doing that?

23:03.760 --> 23:04.760
I don't know!

23:08.880 --> 23:09.880
Hold on!

23:09.880 --> 23:10.960
I'm slipping!

23:14.320 --> 23:15.640
Luke, the talisman!

23:19.240 --> 23:20.680
Ellen, behind you!
Oh, no!

23:21.320 --> 23:23.200
Look out!

23:25.080 --> 23:26.520
It's going to drag her in!

23:33.000 --> 23:34.600
Ah!

23:34.600 --> 23:35.920
Don't let me go!

23:49.800 --> 23:51.680
How can we open a portal
if we don't know where she is?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.680
Well, we have to do something.

23:52.680 --> 23:53.760
This is my fault.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.960
I put the two spells together,
which made the portal malfunction.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.000
It's the key to what happened
to the Bremin Four, I'm sure of it,

23:59.000 --> 24:00.440
and to what's happened to Ellen now.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.640
I can prove there's a connection.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.640
It's all there
in Felix Ferne's journal.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.440
I've got the tracking spell
in the Boss,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.960
but the element to element spell
is in Felix's Book of Shadows.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.000
What are you doing?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.400
We...

24:10.400 --> 24:15.280
..heard everyone talking about it
and we just wanted to see it.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.400
Get out.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.680
It's dangerous.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.600
And all this, all this is...well...

24:20.960 --> 24:21.960
..whatever it actually is.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.360
You were supposed to bring it back.

24:26.360 --> 24:29.040
There was a combined tracking spell
in element to element communication.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.120
And where is it?

24:30.720 --> 24:31.840
Can you hear me?

24:31.840 --> 24:33.040
Ellen!
Help me! Help!

24:33.040 --> 24:35.600
Open a portal.
What? And get attacked again?

24:35.600 --> 24:37.160
What have we been training for?

24:37.160 --> 24:40.120
Stop! Stop right there!
