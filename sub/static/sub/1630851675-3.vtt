11:12.506 --> 11:15.090

I've outgrown my house.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.257
- So, are you gonna get,
like, a storefront?

11:16.309 --> 11:17.809
- Just a warehouse space.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.310
- Do you package
everything?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.729
- I have people
who help me part-time,

11:20.764 --> 11:21.896
like, after hours.
- Okay.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.265
- Knock out,

So, these we did
last night.

embellished, blew up.

- They're lined.
- 'cause they're lined.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.445
- And that is
a big deal, why?

11:37.497 --> 11:38.329
- Because it breaks
your hair.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.063
- Because black girls
and our edges,

11:39.082 --> 11:40.865

to add more styles,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.420

some clothing.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.288
Now, I'm faced
with uncertainty

11:47.340 --> 11:49.407

this growing business,

11:49.443 --> 11:52.444
but I don't want
to make mistakes

11:52.479 --> 11:54.929
that, you know,
puts me into debt.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.314

outgrown this space.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.432
You need a bigger table.
- Let's do this.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.450
This is what
we're gonna do.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.186

I was okay.

known, okay?

it's just the house, though.

different about you.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.799

- Yes, I would--

26:25.835 --> 26:27.284
I would say so.
- Okay.

26:27.303 --> 26:29.786
- I think wanting us to
have this conversation--

26:29.805 --> 26:30.787
- yeah.
- Is a part of my peace

26:30.806 --> 26:34.425
and a part of me feeling like
I'm in a place

26:34.460 --> 26:41.148
where we can move forward,
but it's important that we,

26:41.183 --> 26:43.400
I guess, define
what that looks like.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.351
- How, yes.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.020
- And what our friendship
is gonna look like

26:46.072 --> 26:48.072
in that space.
- I agree.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.573
- I've tried to understand
where you were

26:49.609 --> 26:51.825
because you said continually,
you know,

26:51.861 --> 26:53.360
"this is really hard for me."

26:53.412 --> 26:56.030
- I mean, I know
you're supportive of them both,

26:56.082 --> 26:58.666
but has your opinion
of anyone changed?

26:58.701 --> 27:00.984
- I ask you to respect me
being in the middle.

27:01.003 --> 27:04.154
It's the worst
position to be in.

27:04.190 --> 27:08.008
I know that
you were hurt and mad

27:08.044 --> 27:11.629
at the decision I made
to be neutral.

27:11.664 --> 27:14.682
I don't regret it,
though, candiace, okay?

27:14.717 --> 27:15.799
I did my best.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.852
You were hurt physically,
mentally, and emotionally.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.104
- Yes.
[clears throat]

27:20.139 --> 27:22.856
- I was hurt emotionally.

27:22.892 --> 27:24.558
- What was
emotional for you?

27:24.610 --> 27:26.477
- Where were you?
Did you not see how--

27:26.512 --> 27:29.480
the attack that was levied on me
for the position I took?

27:29.515 --> 27:31.699
- Karen, now,
hopefully, you understand

27:31.734 --> 27:35.185
why we can't stomach
you defending her in any way.

27:35.204 --> 27:37.855
- I'm not defending.
I'm neutral.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.855
- Okay.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.874
- I felt that
I was iced out.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.160
You wanted me to
reach out to you sooner.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.878
I didn't think
you would have received it,

27:44.914 --> 27:47.881
to be honest with you,
because they circled around you

27:47.917 --> 27:49.400
as though they were
protecting you.

27:49.435 --> 27:53.253
- We have always been able
to have conversations

27:53.305 --> 27:56.757
that superseded whatever was
going on with the group.

27:56.809 --> 28:03.147
So, why would outside factors
be a hindrance in--

28:03.182 --> 28:05.899

what it matters the most,

28:05.935 --> 28:09.720

my friend the most?

28:09.739 --> 28:11.221

28:11.240 --> 28:12.222

28:15.277 --> 28:17.911

28:17.947 --> 28:20.698

that's hard for you to hear.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.240

it's a party of one.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.786
You guys met at
an interesting place.

40:22.821 --> 40:23.670

and said,

40:23.705 --> 40:25.705
"hey, we got a new girl
working here.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.373
"she's servin' some
really good drinks."

40:27.426 --> 40:28.258
- oh, my god.
- Oh!

40:28.293 --> 40:29.659

after serving drinks,

40:29.678 --> 40:30.993
yes, I did become
a stripper,

40:31.012 --> 40:32.545

- She's a stripper.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.172
- Well, honey,
I don't do a pole.
- Wait, I didn't strip.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.808
- What do you--
- so, it's a gentlemen's club.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.226
- You make it clap?
- Oh, okay.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.361
- So, it's
a five-star restaurant,
and they don't have a pole

40:48.396 --> 40:49.529
because they don't want
that stigma,

40:49.564 --> 40:50.647

wear long gowns.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.548

40:51.583 --> 40:53.450

- Most of the time,

40:53.485 --> 40:55.251
my clients never wanted me
to take my clothes off.

40:55.287 --> 40:56.953
They just really wanted
to pay you for your time.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.071
- That's like escort.
- Yeah,

40:58.123 --> 40:59.823

have sex for money.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.124

about that.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.192

41:04.079 --> 41:06.028
and they're not
ballgowns, okay?

41:06.047 --> 41:08.548
They're-- they're ones with,

41:17.142 --> 41:18.808

mia over,
