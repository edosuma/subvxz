<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:09.634 --> 00:11.928
[Jughead] Hiram's gonna follow you or us,
wherever we go.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.346
Where is he?

00:13.930 --> 00:16.933
-I've heard of this game before.
-It's an urban legend.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.560
We definitely have to play it.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.687
[Alice] We dubbed ourselves
the Midnight Club.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.605
[Penelope] Welcome to the Ascension Party.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.982
What about these drugs?

00:24.065 --> 00:27.444
-I don't know how they get them.
-A Serpent dealer. Fangs Fogarty.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.612
Go undercover. Join the Gargoyle Gang.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.115
Need a man inside Hiram Lodge's
drug operations

00:32.198 --> 00:34.117
-to take him down.
-[Archie] Your dad's out there.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.537
If we're together, he'll hunt me down.
Everyone close to me is his target.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.706
If you loved me, you would come home.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.042
[Archie]
If I ever wanna go back to Riverdale,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.377
I have to destroy
that part of me that's weak.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.336
[bear roars]

00:45.420 --> 00:47.672
I was attacked by a grizzly.
I'm in bad shape.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.175
[woman] Come on. Wake up, kid.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.015
[Jughead]<i> At 8:47 on a Wednesday morning,</i>

00:57.265 --> 00:58.391
<i>Archie Andrews died.</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:08.860
<i>At least, the Archie we knew.</i>

01:10.987 --> 01:13.323
<i>What returned to Riverdale</i>
<i>was something far different</i>

01:13.406 --> 01:15.158
<i>from the redheaded boy next door.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:18.286
<i>He was now a stranger,</i>

01:19.204 --> 01:20.997
<i>with dark hair and scars...</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:23.458
<i>both inside and out.</i>

01:27.962 --> 01:28.963
What, Vegas?

01:31.549 --> 01:32.383
Archie.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.595
Hey, Dad.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.932
[groans]

01:39.390 --> 01:40.600
What? What's wrong, son?

01:41.059 --> 01:42.143
It's a long story.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.397
I don't remember the rangers finding me.

01:46.481 --> 01:50.610
Then I woke up in the hospital,
knowing that... I couldn't keep running.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.906
It was time to come home,
back to a normal life, if that's possible.

01:55.865 --> 01:56.783
What about Hiram?

01:56.866 --> 01:59.410
[chuckles] I survived a bear attack, Dad.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.623
I can't live my life in fear
of when he might come after me anymore.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.752
I'm more worried
about him gunning for you.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.463
I survived the Black Hood.

02:11.047 --> 02:11.881
Twice.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.675
Hiram doesn't scare me.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.928
He's not the only one in this town
with friends.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.265
What about Veronica? You reach out to her?

02:28.398 --> 02:29.440
[Archie] Veronica?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.153
Archie?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.667
What are you doing here?
Where have you been?

02:47.750 --> 02:49.752
-Why haven't you called me?
-I wanted to.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.963
Every day. But after the last call...

02:52.422 --> 02:54.257
What the hell happened to your hair?

02:56.092 --> 02:58.845
I dyed it,
so I wouldn't get recognized, in case...

03:00.305 --> 03:02.015
your father came looking for me.

03:02.807 --> 03:03.641
Right.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.448
Veronica, I'm sorry.

03:20.158 --> 03:24.370
If you don't wanna ever talk to me again,
I completely understand that.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.290
Don't be crazy, Archie.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.459
I'm just so happy that you're home.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.379
And safe.

03:48.937 --> 03:52.607
[Pop] Two chocolates, one vanilla,
and a root beer float for Archie.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.609
-Welcome home.
-Thanks, Pop.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.238
Since when do you drink root beer floats?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.573
I'm just not in the mood for a milkshake.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.535
New drink, new hair...

04:05.203 --> 04:07.121
new haunted, vacant look in your eyes.

04:07.205 --> 04:11.459
Guys, Archie lived through<i> The Revenant.</i>
Let him order what he wants.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.213
So, what'd I miss while I was gone?

04:16.923 --> 04:20.885
Well, thanks to the town quarantine
orchestrated by my father,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.221
Pop's was shut down, and just reopened.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.099
He's also been attacking shipments
to the speakeasy.

04:26.182 --> 04:29.060
But I've hired the Serpents
as my full-time protection,

04:29.143 --> 04:31.604
and that service extends to you, Archie.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.148
Don't worry about Hiram's goons
coming after you or your dad.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.818
You won't see them,
but I have guys watching you.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.446
I have a possible lead that could diffuse
this threat permanently.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.573
What, Jug?

04:45.868 --> 04:47.036
You can't tell anyone.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.498
Fangs is deep undercover
in the Gargoyle Gang.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.667
Hasn't met the King. He's working on it.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.752
When we get access, we'll take him down.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.505
My bet is it's Hiram underneath the mask.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.883
-Sorry, Veronica.
-Don't be.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.971
-I wouldn't put it past him.
-Well, there goes studying for the SATs.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.015
What?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.391
SATs?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.018
Yeah, they're this Saturday.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.481
Don't worry.
I will help you study and catch up.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.482
Okay? We all will.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.734
[sighs]

05:18.568 --> 05:21.821
I'm sorry, Betty,
but your debit card was declined.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.866
I got you, Bee.
Just put it on my tab, Pop.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.954
This is a new low. I was on the phone
with the Bank of Riverdale,

05:30.038 --> 05:33.708
who told me that all of my accounts,
including my college fund,

05:33.791 --> 05:35.752
have been completely drained of assets.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.879
Not drained, just transferred.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.630
Most of it was blood money

05:39.714 --> 05:41.716
-you inherited from the Blossoms.
-Okay.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.552
Tell me where that money went.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.515
It was wired to the Farm,
as a tax-deductible donation.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.893
You gave my money to the Farm?

05:51.976 --> 05:55.104
To help support the children you liberated
from the Sisters.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.440
-You just gave away my tuition money.
-Or...

05:57.523 --> 06:00.360
of course, you could always study
at the Farm for free.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.070
Mom, I swear to God,

06:02.153 --> 06:05.615
you are not cornering me
into joining your cult.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.120
[Hiram] Fred Andrews.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.331
FP Jones.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.583
What can I do for you fellas?

06:16.584 --> 06:19.379
Came to let you know
that my son is home permanently.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.880
He is?

06:22.507 --> 06:24.967
-That's just great, Fred.
-[FP] Cut the crap, Hiram.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.346
-We all know you have it out for his kid.
-I'll stop you there.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.390
I've never wished any harm to...

06:32.308 --> 06:33.559
either of your sons.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.566
Hiram, if you harm a hair
on Archie's head, I will kill you.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.694
Make no mistake about it.
And I'll be at peace

06:43.778 --> 06:46.781
with whatever the consequences
of that are.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.213
As you transition back into your life
at Riverdale High,

07:02.588 --> 07:06.676
I would advise you to be realistic
in terms of your goals.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.219
I am, Mr. Weatherbee.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.348
I just wanna get caught up,
and I wanna be a normal student again.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.350
The SATs are this coming Saturday.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.729
I'm guessing you haven't really had
a chance to adequately prepare?

07:19.397 --> 07:20.398
Not yet, sir.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.402
Mr. Andrews, given your situation,

07:24.485 --> 07:25.945
I would strongly recommend...

07:27.321 --> 07:28.990
that you repeat your junior year.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.788
And not graduate with my friends?

07:36.998 --> 07:38.040
In the long term...

07:39.500 --> 07:41.252
I believe it would be best for you.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.685
Everything all right?

07:57.768 --> 07:59.979
-You didn't text me back last night.
-Reggie.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.355
Cool it.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.816
Archie's back.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.987
-Archie's back? Since when?
-Look.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.697
I know we were...

08:11.115 --> 08:14.243
But I can't tell Archie
that one of his best friends

08:14.327 --> 08:17.205
and his ex-girlfriend got together
while he was away, so,

08:17.288 --> 08:19.415
-you and I, this has to--
-No, I get it.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.083
Archie's back.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.836
'Nuff said.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.797
How's he doing?

08:27.590 --> 08:28.591
He's feeling...

08:30.760 --> 08:31.594
unsettled,

08:32.303 --> 08:33.304
and stressed.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.057
I can't do anything about the former,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.768
but I definitely can about the latter.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.022
With something that'll help all of us
blow off some steam.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.274
[Betty] <i>She can't do this, can she?</i>

08:45.358 --> 08:49.320
She can as long as both
of your parents signed off

08:49.403 --> 08:50.571
to release your funds.

08:51.113 --> 08:55.535
And from these, it looks like...
your father did sign.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.079
No, that's impossible.
She never goes to see him.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.580
Is this his signature?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.500
No. That's a forgery.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.836
And I know because I, myself,
have forged it in the past.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.006
As part of an investigation.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.552
Well, you need to get your real father
to sign an affidavit,

09:12.635 --> 09:16.305
attesting to the fact that he never agreed
to liquidate your funds.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.349
Then we can pursue legal action.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.268
Which means...

09:22.270 --> 09:23.563
I have to see my dad.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.858
I'm sure you've heard, Hiram,

09:27.942 --> 09:30.570
the Sisters of Quiet Mercy estate
is up for auction.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.698
Appears to be a competitive situation
with multiple bidders,

09:33.781 --> 09:36.701
including the Farm,
coming in with strong offers.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.828
I have other plans for that property.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.288
For my brothel?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.749
The Sisters will not be turned
into a brothel, Madame Blossom.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.460
So, then why did you summon us here,
Hiram?

09:46.544 --> 09:48.212
Because we need a new sheriff.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.549
Someone who'll allow
our various enterprises

09:51.632 --> 09:53.801
to continue without scrutiny.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.471
And I'm nominating you, Claudius.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.934
The last sheriff, Minetta,
was found decapitated.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.938
-You're out of your mind, Hiram.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.526
Did I make it seem
as if you had a choice in the matter?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.695
It's where I want you.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.280
It's not a request.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.537
Iconoclast?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.455
Iconoclast.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.125
[sighs] Okay, iconoclast.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.335
That is...

10:30.087 --> 10:32.089
A person who attacks another's beliefs.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.216
I'm in high school. How should I know?

10:34.300 --> 10:37.219
Let's start thinking about the SATs
in terms of strategy.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.807
When in doubt, why don't you just
fill in all the bubbles marked D?

10:41.891 --> 10:44.727
Betty, how'd I do on the practice test?
I tanked it?

10:45.436 --> 10:46.270
Um...

10:50.316 --> 10:51.484
I got 600 on this part.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.362
That's your combined score, Arch.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.239
It's in the bottom 10th percentile.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.284
[cell phone buzzing]

11:04.497 --> 11:06.832
-I gotta go. It's Fangs.
-Want me to come?

11:06.916 --> 11:09.418
No, stay,
get a couple extra hours of cramming in.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.338
-Betty's gonna catch you up to speed. Bye.
-Bye.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.422
Good luck.
[Archie sighs]

11:18.844 --> 11:21.430
What's the point? It's hopeless, right?

11:21.722 --> 11:24.934
You said that when you were
in second grade and couldn't read.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.603
-Remember? We got you caught up.
-You did, you mean.

11:28.562 --> 11:32.316
Maybe Weatherbee's right.
Maybe I've just missed too much here.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.859
I've changed too much.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.112
Well, in one respect, maybe you have.

11:38.948 --> 11:39.949
Do you trust me?

11:41.617 --> 11:42.952
Jughead, I'm in.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.332
-Tell me everything. What happened?
-The Gargoyle King.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.420
The other guys told me that he's impressed
by my Fizzle Rocks sales,

11:52.503 --> 11:57.049
so, he wants to invite me
into his inner circle.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.760
They're having a ceremony tomorrow night.

12:00.594 --> 12:01.595
He'll be there.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.391
Fangs, this is huge. Where's it happening?

12:05.474 --> 12:07.893
A clearing in Fox Forest.
Not too far from here.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.271
-What do you want me to do?
-Go.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.357
But don't worry, you'll have backup.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.151
[Betty] <i>Okay, Archie, let's see it.</i>

12:15.234 --> 12:16.068
[grunts]

12:19.530 --> 12:20.531
[sighs]
There he is.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.702
And just in time, too.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.371
Just in time for what?

12:30.624 --> 12:31.709
[crowd] Surprise!

12:33.210 --> 12:34.628
-[all cheering]
-[Archie chuckles]

12:34.712 --> 12:36.088
What is all this?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.174
Well, it was going to be a study party,

12:38.257 --> 12:40.509
but that was before
you came back home to us.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.847
So, now it's
a study-slash-welcome-home party, Archie,

12:45.556 --> 12:48.642
complete with a musical amuse-bouche,
provided by <i>moi.</i>

12:49.059 --> 12:51.979
So, take a seat, lover,
and let me entertain you.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.649
[music playing on speakers]

13:04.408 --> 13:06.744
[singing in Spanish]

14:18.774 --> 14:20.192
It's good to see you, Betty.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.445
I'm disappointed it took so long.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.905
Let's skip the small talk.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.285
Is this your signature?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.332
No.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.626
What is that?

14:37.877 --> 14:41.547
Mom stole my college funds,
so, I need you to sign an affidavit

14:41.630 --> 14:43.924
that says
that this signature is a forgery.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.720
In reading the papers most recently,

14:47.803 --> 14:52.057
I found myself compelled
by this Gargoyle King.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.311
Fourteen souls he's claimed.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.937
Remarkable.

14:57.021 --> 15:01.650
Of course,
you'd find a kill count impressive.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.236
I bet it roils you up
that you haven't caught him.

15:06.780 --> 15:07.865
I could help you.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.451
I'm just trying to go to college.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.788
[Hal clears throat]

15:14.872 --> 15:18.417
This Gryphons and Gargoyles manual
that I've read so much about,

15:18.500 --> 15:19.877
bring me a copy...

15:21.045 --> 15:23.589
and I'll be happy to sign your affidavit.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.384
[Reggie] <i>I'm not down with it, Ronnie.</i>

15:27.468 --> 15:30.262
Archie taking off like that?
It's not cool.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.599
He's... in extremis, Reggie.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.561
For all we know he walked back
to Riverdale all the way from Canada,

15:37.645 --> 15:41.482
and right into the pressure cooker
of school and the SATs.

15:41.565 --> 15:42.650
All I'm saying is...

15:43.692 --> 15:46.445
the Archie I saw last night,
he's different.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.447
I don't disagree.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.409
-He is different, Reggie.
-And if it's permanent?

15:53.243 --> 15:54.078
Hmm?

15:54.411 --> 15:58.415
-And he's not your Archiekins anymore?
-Look, I know what you want me to say.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.045
But I just can't even think
about that right now.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.466
[door bangs]

16:11.637 --> 16:14.807
You got some pretty big coconuts,
pulling that stunt last night.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.017
You don't know what you're talking about.

16:18.435 --> 16:22.147
I'm talking about how you stormed out
of the speakeasy like a little bitch.

16:23.399 --> 16:27.569
Bro, I'm warning you,
you don't wanna start with me.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.739
Dude, what the hell happened?
How'd you get those scars?

16:32.116 --> 16:34.910
-I was attacked by a bear.
-What? You serious?

16:35.369 --> 16:37.162
You were attacked by a frigging bear?

16:38.330 --> 16:41.333
Damn. No wonder why you're all messed up.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.299
[Hiram]
<i>Mi amor,</i> we've outgrown the Pembrooke,

16:49.383 --> 16:53.095
so, I've decided
to buy the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.389
It'll be our castle, our stronghold.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.932
Sounds wonderful.

16:57.391 --> 17:01.937
Except that the place is probably haunted
by the ghosts of the nuns that died there.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.731
I'll have it cleansed by a señora.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.191
In the meantime, I need you

17:06.275 --> 17:08.944
to appoint Claudius Blossom
sheriff of Riverdale.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.781
After some careful consideration,
he's agreed to take on the challenge.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.491
Hiram...

17:15.451 --> 17:16.827
-no.
-Mm.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.621
Claudius Blossom is your business partner.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.458
-People will talk.
-So, let them talk.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.918
Given our recent expansions,

17:25.002 --> 17:28.130
it's imperative that we have a friend
in the sheriff's office.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.258
Ironic, considering I don't know
what these expansions are.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.593
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.015
It's what's best for the family,
Hermione, so...

17:38.724 --> 17:39.850
for all our sakes...

17:41.894 --> 17:42.978
but especially yours,

17:43.437 --> 17:44.438
I'd do it quick.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.986
[Betty] The G&G manual, as requested.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.531
Did you bring the affidavit?

18:20.557 --> 18:21.642
Leaving so quickly?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.853
Can't we at least exchange pleasantries?

18:26.980 --> 18:29.316
What? What do you wanna talk about, huh?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.985
The SATs? My college applications?

18:32.069 --> 18:34.363
I think we're beyond that point,
don't you?

18:34.446 --> 18:35.280
[Hal] Perhaps.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.950
So, what if we talked
about Ascension Night?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.787
How do you know about that?

18:43.789 --> 18:44.790
I was there.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.877
How? You weren't a member
of the Midnight Club.

18:48.961 --> 18:49.795
No.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.005
But I knew about them.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.090
Who they were.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.718
I was the one
who sent them the invitations

18:56.802 --> 18:57.845
for Ascension Night,

18:57.928 --> 19:00.139
who dressed up as the Gargoyle King,

19:00.222 --> 19:01.890
and who poisoned the chalices.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.643
Wait, you killed Principal Featherhead?

19:06.186 --> 19:07.980
-Why?
-My plan had been

19:08.063 --> 19:11.316
to kill as many members
of the Midnight Club as possible,

19:12.276 --> 19:14.236
because they were all sinners, Betty.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.863
Every last one of them.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.952
But Featherhead crashed the party
and drank from the cups.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.164
-Was he your first kill?
-Yes.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.875
Is that why you think
you can solve the mystery

19:27.958 --> 19:29.960
of the Gargoyle King in the present?

19:30.043 --> 19:33.463
-Because--?
-Because I was the Gargoyle King...

19:34.506 --> 19:35.591
in the past.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.894
-You and your mom keep missing each other.
-Excuse me?

19:46.977 --> 19:48.937
My mother hasn't been here in months.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.900
-Her name is Alice Cooper, isn't it?
-Yeah.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.068
She comes every Monday, like clockwork.

19:56.987 --> 19:57.988
[Fred] <i>Fresh whites.</i>
Coming in.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.742
Changing it up in here a little bit?

20:01.825 --> 20:04.703
I was studying at my desk,
but it was cluttered with crap.

20:04.786 --> 20:08.916
Whoa. Who is this guy?
The Variety Show. You remember that?

20:08.999 --> 20:11.126
-That was great.
-Barely, to be honest.

20:12.252 --> 20:16.048
-Are you feeling okay, son?
-Yeah, Dad. I'm just restless.

20:16.131 --> 20:20.260
It's weird being home, back in this room,
after all this time. I feel kind of lost.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.054
Wanna--?

20:22.137 --> 20:23.388
Wanna talk about it?

20:23.472 --> 20:26.308
Maybe after the SATs.
I gotta keep studying.

20:27.809 --> 20:28.644
Can you...?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.604
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.323
[breathing deeply]

21:01.969 --> 21:04.513
Fangs Fogarty, kneel before your king.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.690
[growling]

21:18.068 --> 21:20.112
[clinking]

21:23.532 --> 21:26.243
To enter his kingdom,
you must bear his mark,

21:26.326 --> 21:27.828
the mark of the Gargoyle.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.166
[both grunt]

21:37.921 --> 21:40.632
-[Jughead] Now!
-[Serpents yelling]

21:40.716 --> 21:42.718
[Gargoyle] It's the Serpents. Scatter.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.054
[Jughead] Sweet Pea, get Fangs!

21:47.389 --> 21:48.432
[FP] Mine.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.067
Tall Boy?

22:07.534 --> 22:11.371
We all thought you were dead, Tall Boy.
Where you been hiding?

22:13.457 --> 22:15.334
A small town called Athens.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.128
Gotta say,

22:18.211 --> 22:19.296
it's good to be back.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.175
Alice Cooper, she was looking extra sweet

22:23.258 --> 22:25.510
the night me and my boys
broke into her house,

22:25.594 --> 22:28.889
scared the crap out of her
and her bitch daughter. That was fun.

22:29.973 --> 22:30.849
[laughs]

22:31.391 --> 22:33.393
All right. Let's cut to the chase.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.146
We know you work for Hiram.

22:36.855 --> 22:40.025
You've been dressing up
in that little costume, like his mascot.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.443
So, now you...

22:42.069 --> 22:43.695
are gonna help us take him down.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.114
You know what else was fun?

22:47.657 --> 22:50.869
Carving that symbol on Joaquin's forehead
after I killed him.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.788
-You're dead!
-You son of a bitch!

22:52.871 --> 22:53.705
What?

22:53.789 --> 22:55.749
-I'm gonna kill him!
-He killed Joaquin!

22:55.832 --> 22:59.711
What do you think, Tall Boy, huh?
Should I let them tear you limb from limb?

22:59.795 --> 23:02.964
Or are you gonna help us get to Hiram?
You have access to him.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.301
The Man in Black would never agree
to meet with me.

23:06.385 --> 23:11.807
Not unless I have something
that he really wants.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.107
Mom?

23:22.275 --> 23:24.444
-Why are you dressed like that?
-Hmm?

23:24.528 --> 23:27.072
Oh, is that what you wear
when you go visit Dad?

23:27.155 --> 23:30.158
Okay, I don't have time
for your mad ranting, Betty.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.911
I'm prepping for an interview with RIVW.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.831
It's my lifelong dream
to work for local broadcast news.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.290
I went to see Dad.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.378
To try and get my money back,
after you forged his signature.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.462
Okay, Betty...

23:42.754 --> 23:45.882
Dad said he was the one
who murdered Principal Featherhead.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.636
That's impossible.
Your father wasn't even there that night.

23:49.719 --> 23:53.306
How would Dad know details
about Ascension Night, and he does,

23:53.765 --> 23:54.766
unless he was there,

23:54.850 --> 23:57.018
or someone told him
about the Midnight Club?

23:57.102 --> 23:58.478
That someone has to be you.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.940
Okay, Betty, I swear to you,
in 25 years of marriage,

24:02.023 --> 24:04.359
I never mentioned Ascension Night once.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.111
I haven't gone to see your father

24:06.194 --> 24:09.239
since before this whole
Gryphons and Gargoyles mess started.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.658
Someone named Alice Cooper's
been visiting him.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.870
[Reggie] No. No.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.123
Hey, Reg, you busy?

24:18.206 --> 24:19.791
No, just swiping on Bumble,

24:19.875 --> 24:23.378
praying that the future Mrs. Mantle
is within a 30-mile radius.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.923
The truth is love doesn't come easily
to me these days.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.467
[cell phone buzzing]

24:29.342 --> 24:30.594
Or does it?

24:31.636 --> 24:32.471
Okay.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.723
So, Reg...

24:37.350 --> 24:39.311
I need to talk you about something.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.063
I need to talk to you about cheating.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.107
Oh, dude. She told you?

24:44.941 --> 24:46.860
You know it's over, right?

24:47.736 --> 24:48.737
[chuckles]

24:48.904 --> 24:50.280
What are you talking about?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.326
What are you talking about?

24:56.077 --> 24:56.912
I--

24:57.287 --> 24:59.915
I figured you'd know a way
to cheat on the SATs.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.917
Oh, crap.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.252
She's gonna kill me.

25:06.838 --> 25:10.383
She didn't think you'd come back.
I didn't think you'd come back.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.219
Maybe I shouldn't have.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.057
Jug, I don't know
if I can handle any more quizzing.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.601
That's not why I'm here.
I need your help, Archie.

25:19.809 --> 25:23.438
The Gargoyle King is Tall Boy.
We have him locked down in the bunker.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.024
-Tall Boy's alive?
-He's been hiding in Athens.

25:26.107 --> 25:26.942
[sighs]

25:27.526 --> 25:30.362
This is our shot
to finally smoke out Hiram Lodge.
We need bait to lure the Man in Black
out of the shadows.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.409
I'm betting the thing
that he still wants most...

25:38.203 --> 25:39.037
is you.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.039
Save your breath, Jug.

25:41.122 --> 25:44.042
You don't have to convince me
to take down Hiram. I'm in.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.256
-This is Hiram.
-[Tall Boy] <i>I have the Red Paladin.</i>

25:49.381 --> 25:51.967
<i>Him and his friends tried</i>
<i>to ambush us in the woods.</i>

25:52.509 --> 25:53.426
If you want him...

25:54.094 --> 25:55.595
[Hiram] <i>I do. Where?</i>

25:56.304 --> 25:57.889
[Tall Boy] Usual meeting place.

25:58.765 --> 25:59.766
Nine o'clock.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.311
Understood.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.105
Good work.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.904
Hi, this is Elizabeth Cooper.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.116
I was just there yesterday
visiting my dad, Hal Cooper,

26:16.199 --> 26:19.619
and you mentioned
that my mom has also been visiting.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.248
This is gonna seem like a weird question,

26:23.331 --> 26:26.376
but can you just describe to me
what Alice Cooper looks like?

26:27.919 --> 26:29.754
[Betty] <i>Thank you for meeting me, Auntie.</i>

26:30.755 --> 26:32.299
I was reluctant to show up,

26:32.382 --> 26:35.594
since the last time we met,
you accused me of murder.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.763
-I trust that won't happen again.
-No, Auntie.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.265
But I did want to ask,

26:40.682 --> 26:44.519
are you one of those sickos
who fantasizes about serial killers?

26:47.814 --> 26:48.982
As a young woman,

26:49.691 --> 26:52.360
I did write the odd letter
to Jeffrey Dahmer, yes.

26:53.028 --> 26:53.987
[Penelope chuckles]

26:54.863 --> 26:57.699
-Was there a specific reason you ask?
-Yeah.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.244
You've been posing as my mother
to visit my father.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.288
Why?

27:04.914 --> 27:06.750
The only way to get conjugal visits.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.293
A man has his needs.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.171
Did you ever tell him
about Ascension Night?

27:13.798 --> 27:15.759
Yes, during pillow talk.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.678
He's claiming
he was the Gargoyle King back then.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.724
-Why would he lie to me about that?
-Oh. Men and their delusions.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.059
Why do they do anything?

27:25.977 --> 27:27.020
Self-aggrandizement.

You were not at Ascension Night.

The only reason you even know about it
is because Penelope Blossom told you.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.325

27:40.909 --> 27:43.495
why would you take credit
for murdering Featherhead?

27:43.578 --> 27:45.246
Was it so I would write about it?

Big Bad Black Hood, back in the spotlight?

in front of you?

-I have no clue.
-Come on, think about it, Betty.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.012

tell his daughter such a thing?

28:01.721 --> 28:03.431

28:06.226 --> 28:07.394
To keep me on the line.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.107
To keep me coming back to you.

28:13.024 --> 28:17.862
Oh, Betty, how I've missed you
and our chats.

28:18.488 --> 28:24.119
You will stoop to any level to get me back
in your clutches, won't you?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.621

-Archie, when we broke up...

29:49.537 --> 29:50.663
I was angry.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.667
At my father for driving you away,

29:55.043 --> 29:59.214
but mostly at you,
for not fighting to stay by my side.

29:59.714 --> 30:05.470

the more I got tired of missing you.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.598
