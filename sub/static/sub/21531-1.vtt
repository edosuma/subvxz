WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:04.705
Look, I can't see you
again, Tom. You're married.

00:04.738 --> 00:07.808
I know we kissed,
but that's all that happened.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.278
Okay, that happened.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.712
And that happened, too,

00:11.745 --> 00:14.248
but that's only
'cause it fell out.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.950
Oh, we shouldn't be
talking about this, I mean it.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.553
Please, just don't
call me again.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.789
Call me later.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.293
Where were you last night?
I have huge news!

00:25.326 --> 00:27.128
I was here.
I didn't go anywhere.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.630
I have morals.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.766
Look, you can't tell anyone
what I'm about to tell you now.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.604
Karen's dead husband
is not dead.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.411
What? Stan's alive?

00:43.444 --> 00:44.745
But there was a funeral!

00:44.778 --> 00:48.182
We scattered a trash bag
full of his ashes!

00:48.216 --> 00:51.552
Apparently that was just dirt
and Rice Crispies!

00:51.585 --> 00:53.221
[gasps] Oh, my God,

00:53.254 --> 00:55.189
that's unbelievable!
What happened?

00:55.223 --> 00:56.657
Remember Malcolm,
the guy

00:56.690 --> 00:58.626
who recruited me
for his "foundation"?

00:58.659 --> 01:00.128
Turns out he works
for Big Brother!

01:00.161 --> 01:02.996
The TV show?
No! The-- the government!

01:03.030 --> 01:05.466
He staged Stan's death
because Stan was

01:05.499 --> 01:07.034
in some kind of trouble
with the mob,

01:07.135 --> 01:09.303
so for the last two years
he and Stan have been living

01:09.337 --> 01:11.572
in seclusion under
the protection of Big Brother.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.807
The government.
No, the TV show.

01:13.841 --> 01:17.378
Malcolm's sister-in-law's
an associate producer
or something.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.813
Okay, wait a minute,
your new boss

01:19.847 --> 01:21.749
actually works
for the government

01:21.782 --> 01:23.917
and has been protecting
Stan all this time?

01:23.951 --> 01:26.154
Yeah, he's not my boss anymore.
I quit.

01:26.154 --> 01:29.190
The whole thing is just
complicated and convoluted.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.958
It doesn't even
make any sense!

01:30.991 --> 01:33.227
It's like the contract
they make you sign

01:33.261 --> 01:35.163
when you marry Tom Cruise!

01:37.398 --> 01:39.567
Oh, God. Man!

01:39.600 --> 01:42.670
God, Stan is back
from the dead.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.772
What did Karen say?

01:44.805 --> 01:48.442
I mean, she freaked
when her stepdaughter
came back from camp.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.313
She doesn't know.
No one can know

01:52.346 --> 01:54.982
until they're certain it's safe
for Stan to come out of hiding,

01:55.015 --> 01:57.751
so, Grace, we can keep
secrets, right?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.253
Oh, yeah.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.656
I-I mean other
people's secrets.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.459
I don't have any secrets.
I'm a good person.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.864
Hey, Will,
where's Grace?

02:17.238 --> 02:20.441
Oh! How 'bout that,
right in the blind spot.

02:23.010 --> 02:26.247
Anyway, I'm sure you all heard
about the horrible F-I-asco

02:26.280 --> 02:29.283
at the premiere
of Jack Tal last night.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.219
No, and in case
you've forgotten,

02:31.219 --> 02:35.223
we try not
to give people reasons
to call us "butt pirates."

02:38.091 --> 02:40.261
[scoffs] I tripped
making my entrance,

02:40.294 --> 02:42.596
knocked over the lights,
and caught the set on fire.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.465
And that's when
you hurt your eye?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.899
No...
[thump]

02:47.801 --> 02:50.338
When we were celebrating
putting out the fire,

02:50.371 --> 02:53.974
I got a piece of glitter
in my cornea.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.743
Grace, I called you
last night, where were you?

02:55.776 --> 02:58.111
Did you get together
with that Tom guy?
Seemed like you two--

02:58.145 --> 02:59.847
Stan's alive.
Will saw him.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.253
*

03:09.890 --> 03:11.425
It's true, Jack.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.361
Last night I sat
across from Stan

03:13.394 --> 03:16.096
and he talked to me
same as I'm talking
to you right now.

03:16.129 --> 03:20.067
If I were eating
14 chalupas.

03:21.302 --> 03:25.639
Wow. I need some time
to process that.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.676
It may take a while,
'cause I only have one eye.

03:34.315 --> 03:38.118
All I know is that
I was here last night.

03:38.151 --> 03:41.289
That's all...

03:41.289 --> 03:43.090
[knocking]

03:44.925 --> 03:46.560
Malcolm?
Hi. Hi, gang.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.796
I'm sorry to barge
in here unannounced,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.698
uninvited, and
reeking of hummus,

03:50.731 --> 03:52.900
but, Will...
can I speak with you

03:52.933 --> 03:55.736
privately, please?
It's urgent.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.439
Sure, just let me get some pita
to dip in your breath.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.510
Why did you quit
your job?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.345
Was it because I said
you couldn't wear

04:04.378 --> 04:06.079
open-toed shoes to work?

04:06.113 --> 04:10.584
Uh, no, it's because I was
working for a bogus charity,

04:10.618 --> 04:13.321
which was a cover
for a shady government operation

04:13.321 --> 04:15.456
to protect a back-from-the-dead
former client!

04:15.489 --> 04:19.693
And, by the way, some sandals
can be very dressy.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.729
I just hope you haven't
been blabbing about Stan,

04:21.762 --> 04:24.665
because anybody that knows
anything could be a target
for assassination.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.567
What? You never
mentioned that!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.001
Well, que sera sera.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.837
What does that mean?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.439
"Whatever will be,
will be."

04:31.472 --> 04:33.407
It's the very next
line of the song.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.443
I know what it means.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.010
I was obsessed with Doris Day

04:37.044 --> 04:40.147
the same as any other
normal teenage boy.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.815
Look, the most important
thing right now

04:41.849 --> 04:43.384
is to get these
ice cream sandwiches

04:43.417 --> 04:45.018
into your freezer
as soon as possible.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.254
What are you doing
with ice cream sandwiches?

04:47.355 --> 04:49.623
Drop by without a gift?
I was raised better than that.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.924
[elevator dings]

04:50.958 --> 04:53.260
No one can see us talking.
Quick, I'm your boyfriend.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.596
[muffled shout]

05:03.136 --> 05:04.505
Hey, hey, hey!

05:04.538 --> 05:06.106
Come on!

05:06.139 --> 05:07.675
[gulps]

05:07.708 --> 05:11.912
Will, that is just disgusting
and unnatural!

05:11.945 --> 05:14.648
Oh, you're not Grace.
Never mind. Sorry.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.552
Karen, what happened to you?

05:18.586 --> 05:21.088
Oh, you know how my big toe
and the one next to it

05:21.121 --> 05:23.891
have always
been webbed together?

05:23.924 --> 05:27.628
No, although I always
assumed you had a tail.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.799
Yeah, well, I finally had
it surgically corrected.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.067
Can't swim in really fast
circles anymore,

05:34.101 --> 05:35.202
but can wear flip-flops.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.239
She removed the one thing
that made her human.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.608
[Karen chortles]

05:40.641 --> 05:44.177
Uh, excuse me, miss.
Uh, Malcolm Widmark.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.980
I hope this isn't too forward,
but I find you quite beautiful

05:47.014 --> 05:49.617
and I look forward to the day
that I see you ride this thing

05:49.650 --> 05:50.951
toward me on a very bumpy road.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.189
In a town
where everyone's naked.

05:59.059 --> 06:03.163
Karen Walker.
And it is a pleasure
to meet a true gentleman.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.302
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:09.336 --> 06:10.804
the gap between my toes

06:10.838 --> 06:13.006
is throbbing
like a son of a bitch.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.146
Sheer elegance.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.248
What can I say,
she's everything Stan

06:21.281 --> 06:22.916
said she would be
and much more.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.452
Your package
is dripping.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.119
What can I say,
I like her.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.560
The ice cream sandwiches!

06:34.595 --> 06:37.765
So, the doctor said
he could separate my toes

06:37.798 --> 06:40.468
with a laser, but I said,
"Nope, scissors."

06:42.102 --> 06:45.473
Hey, if it was good enough
for my mother...[chuckles]

06:46.840 --> 06:50.210
Anyhoo. Thanks for not
making me feel self-conscious.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.614
Hey, Cyclops,
what's with the idiot patch?

06:56.784 --> 06:59.520
I had the largest
glitter-related tragedy

06:59.553 --> 07:02.289
since Mariah Carey's
film debut.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.528
Hello.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.765
Tom, I don't think
I can go ahead with it.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.034
Because it's wrong.
I said no.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.335
Please just stop calling.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.875
The American
Heart Association.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.513
They're relentless.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.414
The boys are back.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.817
Uh, Ms. Walker,
I have dated many women

07:29.850 --> 07:32.586
with physical and mental
disabilities in my time,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.522
but of the ones in chairs,

07:34.522 --> 07:37.625
might I say
you are the loveliest.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.627
Speaking of chairs,

07:39.660 --> 07:42.362
you look like
a fun place to sit.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.768
How would you like to go out
on a date with me, right now?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.038
I can't see
any reason why not.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.642
You can't?
Wanna give it a minute?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.779
Well, let me
just freshen up.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.815
Come on, Rosie.
Vamoose, moose.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.417
I'm going on lunch, lady.

08:04.451 --> 08:08.121
Mm! Subway.
Chicken Parm.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.791
Mm, it could
only taste better

08:10.824 --> 08:13.260
if I were eating
this on your grave.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.566
Sassy gals get the hoes.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.001
You know,

08:21.034 --> 08:22.570
since my de-webbing,

08:22.603 --> 08:27.007
I have so much more compassion
for people in pain.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.576
Ow!

08:29.910 --> 08:31.579
Walk it off, sissy!

08:35.949 --> 08:39.386
Malcom, can I speak
to you privately?

08:39.419 --> 08:40.988
Ow!

08:43.090 --> 08:46.326
You can't date Karen!
You're still protecting
her husband!

08:46.359 --> 08:48.228
It's a clear
conflict of interest!

08:48.261 --> 08:49.863
Ooh, conflict of interest!

08:49.897 --> 08:53.366
Somebody went
to the University of Fancy!

08:53.400 --> 08:55.202
Look, Will, don't worry.
It's all part of the plan.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.737
We'll talk it over
at the office tomorrow.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.471
No, we won't.
We're gonna do my plan.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.308
You don't date Karen,
you accept the fact
that I quit,

09:01.341 --> 09:03.944
and you never
bring ice cream
to a gay man's house.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.378
That's just hostile.

09:06.413 --> 09:09.382
Jack, you've had affairs

09:09.416 --> 09:12.620
with married men, right?

09:12.620 --> 09:16.523
I am insulted
you would even ask.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.792
Of course I have.

09:20.828 --> 09:24.331
That's like me asking you
if you rely too much
on your hair.

09:26.934 --> 09:32.305
Guilty. It even got me out
of my math requirement at NYU.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.245
So, you don't feel worried
that cheating makes you
a bad person?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.280
Why? What have I done?

09:40.313 --> 09:43.651
My only crime
is being irresistible.

09:43.684 --> 09:48.421
Besides, Grace, life is
too short to waste time
on overthinking things.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.491
When an opportunity comes,
I don't question it.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.027
I grab it, drop its ring
on the nightstand,

09:54.061 --> 09:56.096
and swing on it till dawn.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.769
[giggles]

10:03.303 --> 10:06.339
[audience laughter swells]

10:08.341 --> 10:10.711
You make it sound--
[laughing]

10:12.179 --> 10:14.414
You make it sound so hot.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.785
Necessary, even.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.620
Um, yeah!

10:20.654 --> 10:23.156
And, um, it's also
kind of sexy

10:23.190 --> 10:25.258
to have a secret
no one knows.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.994
Like, when you
drink too much,

10:27.027 --> 10:29.496
get a little tattoo
that says,
"I love Will."

10:29.529 --> 10:30.698
What?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.603
Did you hear that?
Karen's hurt.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.038
Karen, are you okay?

10:38.071 --> 10:39.372
-[thud]
-Ow!

10:39.406 --> 10:42.776
Did you hear that?
Rosie's hurt.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.678
Tom, hi.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.313
Let's do it.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.614
Yeah.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.916
Life is too short,

10:48.949 --> 10:50.417
and I just want
to grab at it

10:50.450 --> 10:53.320
and swing at it
till dawn.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.822
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.857
That's just
a little figure of speech.

10:56.890 --> 11:00.160
I mean, we're gonna run
out of stuff way before dawn.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.195
Yeah, I don't do
that much.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.398
-Okay.
-Okay.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.001
It's official.
I don't trust Malcolm.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.302
I don't trust
Malcolm, either.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.904
-There, I said it.
-No, I just said it.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.173
Yeah, but you didn't say,
"There, I said it."

11:13.206 --> 11:15.042
I agree with Jack.
Malcolm can't be trusted.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.110
I said it before he--
Look, the important thing is

11:17.144 --> 11:18.545
we have to tell Karen
the truth,

11:18.578 --> 11:19.847
that her husband
is alive.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.415
We have to tell Karen
Stan's alive. There, I said it.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.617
-No, I said it!
-You're right, Grace.
-I said it before--

11:24.651 --> 11:27.254
I'm the one making
dramatic pronouncements here!

11:27.287 --> 11:28.756
About what, honey?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.765
Karen, you can't
go out with Malcolm.

11:37.765 --> 11:38.966
Why not?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.400
Because...

11:42.635 --> 11:44.471
Because Stan's alive.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.117
[conniption laugh]

11:58.852 --> 12:01.388
Now, that is one hot cackle.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.489
Are you ready?

12:02.522 --> 12:03.791
Oh, Malcolm.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.693
You would not believe
what Will just said

12:06.794 --> 12:08.328
to keep us from dating.

12:08.361 --> 12:12.699
He said that my dead husband
Stan is alive.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.301
[yipping]

12:14.334 --> 12:15.602
[Malcolm laughing]

12:15.635 --> 12:17.604
Oh, Will, you kill me,

12:17.637 --> 12:21.174
and one day I'm gonna have
to repay the favor.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.178
I did not see that coming.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.582
Well, I-I saw
half of it coming.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.226
Will, out
in the hallway now!

12:39.259 --> 12:40.593
Hi, gang.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.165
Buddy, you made a big mistake
telling Karen about Stan.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.666
Thank God she thought
you were joking.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.368
If you pull that
one more time,

12:48.401 --> 12:51.438
you are going to be
majorly assassinated.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.475
"Majorly assassinated"?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.644
Wicked assassinated?

12:57.677 --> 13:00.848
Oh, for God's sake, this
isn't about Stan anymore.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.215
There's no danger.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.984
You just want
to sleep with Karen.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.119
Gosh, I just wanted
to hold hands,

13:06.153 --> 13:08.288
but you think she'll go
all the way?

13:08.321 --> 13:09.722
I know I've overstated
the danger to you.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.091
I just want to keep Stan

13:11.124 --> 13:12.292
underground
for a little while longer

13:12.325 --> 13:13.493
to see if I have
a future with his wife.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.728
A future with her?
You just met her!

13:15.762 --> 13:19.900
I've known her eight years,
and I just found out
she has fish feet.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.872
Jack, help me figure out
what to bring.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.174
Which one is sexier?

13:27.207 --> 13:30.677
Oh, Grace, I have no opinion
on women's undergarments.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.881
I don't know what
pokes through where.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.682
And where are you going?

13:35.715 --> 13:37.750
I'm going to meet Tom.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.487
You know what? I'm not even
gonna think about it.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.156
I'm just gonna close my eyes
and do what I want.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.325
Oh, hey, hello.
I'm George Bush.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.128
How 'bout that?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.363
[audience cheering]

13:52.699 --> 13:55.568
Wait a minute. Are you
telling me you intend

13:55.602 --> 13:58.438
to know a married man
in the Biblical sense?

13:58.471 --> 14:00.440
And in the vagina?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.711
You can't do that.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.514
Jack, we talked
about this.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.150
You said it was fun
and sexy.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.185
Not for you!

14:12.219 --> 14:15.122
You are a woman
of quality.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.290
That is such a--
That's such a double standard!

14:17.324 --> 14:19.226
What, you get to do it,
but I don't?

14:19.259 --> 14:21.161
It's different for me
because--

14:21.194 --> 14:23.430
Because it--

14:23.463 --> 14:25.432
[stammers]

14:25.465 --> 14:26.766
All right, listen.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.401
I am gonna
tell you something

14:28.435 --> 14:30.770
that does not leave
this room, okay?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.174
I've never cheated.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.977
No!

14:37.010 --> 14:39.612
[suppresses cough]

14:39.646 --> 14:41.414
Yes.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.716
I, too, am a...
[giggles]

14:43.750 --> 14:46.786
I, too, am a woman
of quality.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.258
Sure, I talk a big game,

14:51.291 --> 14:53.826
but deep down I know
it's wrong, and so do you.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.762
Let's face it, Grace,
you and I,

14:55.795 --> 14:58.598
we've always been
the moral center of our group.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.070
We have?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.537
Oh, come on!

15:04.571 --> 15:05.973
You know how
when Will and Karen

15:05.973 --> 15:08.341
get into their
ridiculous shenanigans,

15:08.375 --> 15:11.611
you and I always catch
each other's eyes
and shrug.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.847
We shrug?

15:14.881 --> 15:15.983
Yes!

15:16.016 --> 15:18.018
Because we're moral.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.353
That is why we shrug.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.989
[sighs]

15:21.989 --> 15:25.125
And, Grace, you were
devastated when Leo
cheated on you.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.060
Do you really want to do
that to someone else?

15:27.094 --> 15:30.030
The more you know.
And shooting star.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.807
You know what, Jack?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.575
[both suppressing giggles]

15:42.609 --> 15:44.344
You're right.
You're right.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.579
You're right.
You're right.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.016
[suppressing laugh]

15:49.016 --> 15:51.651
Tell me how you feel
about this business, then.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.754
I-I thought that I could be
cavalier about love and sex,

15:54.787 --> 15:57.324
but that's not who I am,
and I'm glad it's not.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.759
Thank you for being
honest with me, Jack.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.328
Really.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.829
Well...

16:04.364 --> 16:07.034
If I'm really gonna
be honest, uh...

16:08.568 --> 16:11.071
There's something else
I need to say to you.

16:13.840 --> 16:18.478
I, uh, do not have a GRI--

16:18.511 --> 16:20.713
glitter-related injury.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.451
[exhales deeply]

16:26.519 --> 16:28.688
Something
much more hideous.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.923
[gasping]

16:44.304 --> 16:47.940
[both suppressing giggles]

16:51.411 --> 16:52.845
Buh--

16:58.751 --> 17:01.554
What happened
to your eyebrow?

17:01.588 --> 17:03.790
Funny you should ask.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.359
During the fire,

17:06.393 --> 17:08.461
I "sing-ed" it off.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.098
You mean singed.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.600
No, actually,
I mean "sing-ed."

17:13.633 --> 17:16.002
As the set burned around me,

17:16.103 --> 17:19.739
I refused to stop singing
my patriotic finale...

17:19.772 --> 17:23.410
"You're a Grand Old Fag."

17:23.443 --> 17:25.478
When I went to salute,

17:25.512 --> 17:27.714
I didn't realize
my sleeve was on fire.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.550
Okay, look, we're done!

17:30.583 --> 17:32.585
Will, I didn't want
to have to play this card,

17:32.619 --> 17:36.523
but if you keep it up,
I'm coming after your family.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.025
That's the Partridge family.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.263
Would you be upset
if they died?

17:43.296 --> 17:44.797
[elevator dings]

17:44.831 --> 17:46.133
Do not try to kiss me.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.367
I wasn't going to.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.901
Why, was I bad?

17:50.137 --> 17:52.372
William, Malcom, inside!

17:52.405 --> 17:53.973
We need to talk.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.142
We certainly do.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.943
Will, don't make
trouble for me.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.578
I just want to have
dinner with Karen

17:58.611 --> 18:00.147
and catch a flight
to DC by midnight.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.981
I have to shred
some documents for a client.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.684
I can't say who,
but I can't delay it.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.158
You understand?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.859
Delay it.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.164
It's Tom DeLay.
It's Tom DeLay's documents.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.432
(Will) You're an idiot!

18:21.168 --> 18:25.705
Well, Will said something
that has made me very curious.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.664
Well, I see you're curious,
too, Jack.

18:58.104 --> 19:01.241
I just don't understand
why Will would lie to me

19:01.274 --> 19:04.076
about Stan being alive.
I mean, come on, let's face it.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.879
Will and I have always been
the moral center of our group.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.055
Stanley loved me.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.791
He loved me too much
to put me through the pain

19:18.825 --> 19:21.127
of the last two years
for nothing.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.062
So I know he's dead
and I don't want

19:23.095 --> 19:24.397
anybody saying otherwise.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.899
Miss Karen--
Rosie, you stay out of this.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.935
Miss Karen,
Mr. Stan isn't dead.

19:28.968 --> 19:33.273
I've been sending him
updates on you
for over a year.

19:33.306 --> 19:37.109
He was in trouble, Karen.
He had to disappear.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.246
And now the love
of your life is back.

19:43.015 --> 19:43.983
Well..

19:45.518 --> 19:47.086
Stan's alive.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.756
Well..

19:49.789 --> 19:52.492
Ain't that a kick
in the pants.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.964
Rosie, thank you for finally
telling me the truth.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.368
You're fired.
I never want to see you again.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.770
Malcolm, I'm ready
for our date.

20:03.803 --> 20:07.774
Stan may be alive,
but he's still dead to me.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.009
Ciao.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.779
Wow.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.947
I feel so sad.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.086
Grace, will you
change my eyebrow?

20:26.426 --> 20:28.595
