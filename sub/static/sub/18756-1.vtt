(alarm blaring)

00:07.341 --> 00:08.676
- (moans)

00:11.879 --> 00:14.014
Whoop!
(alarm dies out)

00:14.048 --> 00:15.149
(playful music)

00:15.183 --> 00:16.550
(crow squawks)

00:16.584 --> 00:17.685
(thunder booming)

00:17.718 --> 00:19.653

00:19.687 --> 00:21.389

00:22.723 --> 00:26.694

00:26.727 --> 00:30.364

00:30.398 --> 00:31.499
(slow-motion whooshing)

00:31.532 --> 00:33.234
(metal crashing)
(cat shrieks)

00:36.070 --> 00:37.271
- Dumbass.

00:37.305 --> 00:42.176
*

00:42.210 --> 00:44.178
- Oh.
(electricity crackling)

00:44.212 --> 00:45.546
(sighs)

00:45.579 --> 00:47.515
Puma!
(puma snarls)

00:47.548 --> 00:50.718
Ooh! Aah! Get--no, no!
(puma growling)

00:50.751 --> 00:52.620
(struggling)

00:52.653 --> 00:54.188
Why?

00:54.222 --> 01:01.129
*

01:23.951 --> 01:27.388
- So how was your day?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.623
- Pretty good.

01:29.657 --> 01:32.660
(downtempo electronic music)

01:32.693 --> 01:33.661
*

01:33.694 --> 01:34.995
- Ah!

01:35.028 --> 01:38.466
*

01:38.499 --> 01:40.501
- (squeaks)

01:40.534 --> 01:42.270

- (growls)

01:43.637 --> 01:50.644
*

01:59.220 --> 02:02.356
- (kisses) All right,
I have to go to work.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.624
- No.
- Yes.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.758
Yes, got to.
- (kissing)

02:04.792 --> 02:06.327
Starfish.
- I got to do it.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.662
- Don't leave me.
- I got to do it. Sorry.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.531
(groans)

02:10.564 --> 02:13.267
- I think you still have some
clean shirts in the Josh drawer.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.468
- Hey.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.036
- Told you.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.371
- Can I have
some of this coffee?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.506
- Yeah, of course.
You can take the rest.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.808
- Mmm, thank you.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.343
Aw, look at that.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.044
Amazing.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.113
Um, hey, did you get
that e-mail I sent you

02:26.146 --> 02:27.648
about how cute you are?
- You're cute.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.383
- No, you're cute.
- You're cute.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.851
- You're cute, Mrs. Cute.
- Shut up. You're cute.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.320
- You're cute.
I think you're cute, Mrs. Cute.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.054
- Me?
- Yes.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.489
- Really? Thank you.
- You're so cute. (kissing)

02:35.523 --> 02:38.326
(babbling and giggling)

02:38.359 --> 02:40.328
Um, wha--
uh, are you sure

02:40.361 --> 02:41.495
that your roommates are, like,

02:41.529 --> 02:43.397
cool with me being here
this much?

02:43.431 --> 02:45.299
- Oh, my God, yeah, no, I've
known these guys, like, forever.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.300
They're super cool.
- Yeah?

02:46.334 --> 02:47.535
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.737
Hey, top of the morning,
uh, roommates.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.507
Or, uh, Megan, should I say
"top of the Megan to you"?

02:56.277 --> 02:58.178
Uh, Robin, Robin,

02:58.212 --> 03:00.581
sorry again about last night,
about our moment.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.717
Um, you really got to lock
that bathroom door, buddy.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.253
I-I should have knocked,

03:05.286 --> 03:06.754
but you should have locked.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.623
Uh, it's a learning experience
for us both.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.226
Uh,

03:12.260 --> 03:13.661
Chris, all right,
bring it in, buddy.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.596
Give me one.
One.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.697
Two.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.766
Three.
Four.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.434
It's four.
There's always four.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.835
Well, it's okay.
It's tricky.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.170
We'll figure it out
tonight.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.605
Uh, all right, guys.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.773
(kisses)
- Bye.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.775
(footsteps depart)

03:27.808 --> 03:29.277
(door shuts)

03:29.310 --> 03:30.878
- What?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.680
(tense marimba music)
- You know what.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.448
- He's here all the time, Lucy.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.683
- Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.050
- Yeah, well,
we're your friends.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.352
- You can't just let
boyfriends come in here

03:38.386 --> 03:39.787
and stay as long as they want.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.088
- What do you have against him?

03:41.121 --> 03:42.723
- He eats all our food.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.292
He drinks all our coffee.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.759
- He uses all our toilet paper.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.395
- He's a drain on our resources.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.729
- Okay, I think
you're overreacting.

03:48.762 --> 03:49.797
- Overreacting?
- Yeah.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.432
- He's not on the lease.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.567
That means he's living here
illegally.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.269
- You--come on,
you guys aren't

03:55.303 --> 03:58.105
gonna make this
a big thing, are you?

03:58.138 --> 04:00.140
(dramatic music)

04:02.276 --> 04:03.944
- Tough talk today
from apartment leaders

04:03.977 --> 04:06.314
who are calling for
the deportation of boyfriends

04:06.347 --> 04:08.616
living illegally
in unit 3R.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.484
I'm joined by Megan.
- Hi.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.454
- Megan, why is this such
a hot-button issue for you?

04:13.487 --> 04:15.789
- Well, Brad,
I love our apartment.

04:15.823 --> 04:19.460
I think it is the greatest
apartment in the world.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.261
But if we don't
start cracking down

04:21.295 --> 04:23.230
on these undocumented
boyfriends,

04:23.263 --> 04:25.499
then pretty soon,
I tell you what,

04:25.533 --> 04:27.301
we're not gonna have
an apartment left.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.736
- Now, Megan, I agree with you,

04:28.769 --> 04:30.471
but how would you
respond to those who

04:30.504 --> 04:33.774
claim that boyfriends
make the apartment stronger?

04:33.807 --> 04:36.810
- Look, this might not
sound politically correct,

04:36.844 --> 04:39.413
but let's be honest,
we're not getting

04:39.447 --> 04:41.349
the best
and the brightest here.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.318
We're getting the vermin,
the criminals.

04:44.352 --> 04:47.488
And that is why,
effective immediately,

04:47.521 --> 04:49.590
our apartment
will be taking steps

04:49.623 --> 04:51.325
to secure its borders.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.327
(sinister music)

04:53.361 --> 04:55.829
- Oh, man.
- Oh, come on.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.830
(sighs)

04:56.864 --> 04:58.866
Hi.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.834
- She's on the lease.
Let her through.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.436
- Thank--thank you, sir.
Thank you.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.804
- Whoa!
- Ah.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.872
- Not you, illegal.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.707
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.342
It's--it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.843
I'll just, uh--

05:09.877 --> 05:11.612
I'll go to the movies
or something; it's fine.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.213
- No, you know what?
What Megan's doing is wrong.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.515
I'm gonna fix this.
You stay right here.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.484
- Okay.
- Right here, Josh.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.485
Move!

05:17.518 --> 05:18.852
- Okay.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.388
- I can't believe you guys
are doing this.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.155
This is so hypocritical.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.791
Chris, what about Ted?

05:23.824 --> 05:26.894
- Ted is here
on a three-day sex visa, okay?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.962
He comes in, he does his job,
and then he leaves.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.197
- What is your
problem with Josh?

05:30.230 --> 05:31.565
If you just give him a shot--

05:31.599 --> 05:32.800
- He doesn't even
speak the language, Luce.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.301
When we're all
watching "The Bachelor,"

05:34.334 --> 05:37.037
he's like,
"Uh, me not understand."

05:37.070 --> 05:38.572
- Okay, whoa.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.641
- "There's more than one
named Amanda?"

05:40.674 --> 05:42.209
- You do not
have to do the voice.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.310
- It's what he sounds like.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.878
- Okay, I get it.
You guys don't like Josh.

05:44.912 --> 05:48.716
But I do, so can you please
just give him a chance for me?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.984
- Maybe he could stay, but just

05:51.018 --> 05:52.720
poop at home instead of here?

05:52.753 --> 05:54.354
- No, Robin.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.723
Josh isn't welcome here,

05:55.756 --> 05:57.391
and he never will be.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.393
Give it up, Luce,
it's over.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.428
(sly music)

06:00.461 --> 06:01.562
- We'll see.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.597
*

06:06.867 --> 06:07.835
- Hey.
- Yeah?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.403
- Illegal?
- Yes.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.338
- You speak-y "The Bachelor,"
huh?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.173
- What?
- Rose ceremony?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.908
Fantasy suite?
(chuckles)

06:14.942 --> 06:17.511
- I-I don't understand
what you're talking about.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.613
- (chuckles)
(cell phone buzzes)

06:19.647 --> 06:21.582
(text messages chiming)

06:21.615 --> 06:24.585
(lively suspenseful music)

06:24.618 --> 06:27.387
(text messages chiming)

06:27.421 --> 06:30.858
- (panting)

06:30.891 --> 06:33.761
Oh, man.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.596
*

06:35.629 --> 06:36.597
(dramatic sting)

06:36.630 --> 06:37.631
(shovel scrapes)

06:37.665 --> 06:38.932
Ah, ah.
- Josh, Josh.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.434
- Oh, oh.
- It's me. Come here.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.802
Come here. It's okay.
- Oh, God.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.370
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Agua.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.772
- It's okay, baby.
- Agua.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.707
- It's okay. Here, here.
Here, it's okay.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.408
- Oh, it's so bright in here.
- (shushing)

06:48.442 --> 06:51.411
- Mmm. Mmm!

06:51.445 --> 06:52.546
- It's okay, okay.
It's okay.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.747
You're safe now.
You're safe.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.948
(intense music)
- Ah!

06:54.982 --> 06:56.283
- Go get him!
- No!

06:56.316 --> 06:57.585
- No, no, no!
(dog barking)

06:57.618 --> 06:58.586
No, no!
(Josh screaming)

06:58.619 --> 06:59.587
- Back off, ma'am.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.754
Back...off.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.557
*

07:03.591 --> 07:05.025
- (grunts)

07:06.927 --> 07:09.963
- Go back to where you come
from, you stinkin' boyfriend!

07:09.997 --> 07:11.398
- Get out.
- You're disgusting, Josh.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.633
- Go!
- No one wants you!

07:12.666 --> 07:14.434
- Go!
- Listen to me.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.437
Hear my words.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.840
I first came to this apartment

07:19.873 --> 07:21.775
with nothing but
the shirt on my back,

07:21.809 --> 07:23.944
my toothbrush,
and my phone

07:23.977 --> 07:26.079
and my phone charger, uh,

07:26.113 --> 07:29.583
but through it all,
I never lost sight of the dream

07:29.617 --> 07:32.520
of coming to this
beautiful apartment

07:32.553 --> 07:35.088
and hanging out with Lucy,
so, please, I ask you--

07:35.122 --> 07:36.590
- (yells)

07:36.624 --> 07:37.758
- Ah!

07:37.791 --> 07:38.859
Jesus, Robin.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.694
- (crying)
- No, no, no.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.829
You did the right thing.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.930
- What?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.998
- Just get out of here.
- Fine.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.001
(Kishi Bashi's "Philosophize
In It! Chemicalize With It!")

07:48.035 --> 07:51.805
*

07:51.839 --> 07:54.775
We will.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.844
- Lucy...
- Thank you.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.613
- Lucy, what are you doing?

07:59.647 --> 08:02.382
- I am moving in with Josh.
- Hey.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.852
- You can't move
to Josh's place; it's not safe.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.620
- It's rife with drugs!

08:06.654 --> 08:08.956
- Plus, you guys,
like, just started dating.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.792
- I don't care.
I'm doing it anyway.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.561
Come on, Josh.
- Are you sure you--

08:13.594 --> 08:16.129
you--you want
to move in with me?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.632
- Yeah.
Absolutely.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.701
- * I will take you offline

08:20.734 --> 08:23.871
* Philosophize in it,
chemicalize with it *

08:23.904 --> 08:25.472
*

08:25.505 --> 08:27.007
- Eat it!

08:30.911 --> 08:32.512
- (kisses) Hey.
- Mm, mornin'.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.548
- I hate to say it,
but I have to go to work.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.849
- No, no.
- (laughing) Get off me.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.719
I have to. Ready?
- All right, fine.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.821
I-I think there's some, uh,

08:40.854 --> 08:42.690
clean shirts in the Lucy drawer.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.430
- You know what?
I think the shirt I'm wearing

08:50.463 --> 08:51.899
is actually probably fine.

08:51.932 --> 08:52.933
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.268
- Yeah.
Hey, are you sure

08:55.302 --> 08:57.270
you're comfortable
here at my place?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.939
I-I know that
my humble abode

08:58.972 --> 09:01.274
isn't as stylish
as you're used to.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.910
- I don't care.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.945
I'm fine as long
as I'm with you.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.981
(incoming Skype call chiming)

09:09.917 --> 09:11.952
(exhales)

09:11.985 --> 09:13.186
(Skype call connects)

09:13.220 --> 09:15.055
Hey, dude, what's up?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.590
- Just calling to say hi.
It's been a while.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.191
- Yeah, yeah, you're right,
sorry.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.393
Josh and I have just
been, uh, settling in.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.395
- Hey, nice beer can
collection.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.865
- Hmm?
Oh, that's--

09:24.898 --> 09:27.034
I'm not--they're just on--

09:27.067 --> 09:29.302
- Oh, my God,
is that a lava lamp?

09:29.336 --> 09:32.439
- Um, give me
one se--second.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.976
I'm just...
gonna find...

09:36.009 --> 09:37.544
Hey! There.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.046
- I was thinking I could
come over sometime,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.147
get the grand tour?

09:40.180 --> 09:43.150
(tense music pounds)

09:43.183 --> 09:45.452
*

09:45.485 --> 09:47.888
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure, come by anytime.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.489
- How 'bout tonight?
I'll bring Chris and Robin.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.958
I'm sure they'd love
to see it too.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.392
- Sure.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.561
Great, that's--
that's great.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.429
- Great.
See you at 8:00.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.898
Stoked.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.232
- Okay. Bye.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.233
(Skype call disconnects)

10:00.267 --> 10:02.636
(dramatic music pounds)

10:02.670 --> 10:04.137
(exhales deeply)

10:06.439 --> 10:08.175
- Hey, hey,
good news.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.310
I got the drawer out, so--
What?

10:10.343 --> 10:11.912
What--what is happening?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.613
- My friends are coming over.
- Oh, cool.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.615
- No, no, no, no, no, not cool.
They're super judgmental.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.284
You know them.
The place is a mess.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.286
- Yeah?
Yeah, I guess.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.588
Okay, uh, no biggie.
Uh, we'll just clean up.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.256
I'll go get the, uh, Swiffer.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.624
(soft tense music)

10:24.658 --> 10:27.027
Oh!
What the heck are you doing?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.128
What--what's going on?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.629
- Do you not get it?

10:29.663 --> 10:31.331
If they see any of this shit,
we are looking at,

10:31.364 --> 10:32.933
like, eight to ten years
of getting made fun of.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.034
I can't take that, man.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.535
I'm too weak.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.204
Too goddamn weak, Josh.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.538
(toy pig squeaks)

10:38.571 --> 10:40.273
- Uh, like, so...

10:40.307 --> 10:42.275
not this, obviously;
we're--

10:42.309 --> 10:43.643
Oh, no, no, no, wait.
What are you doing?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.478
There are still
cheat codes in here,

10:45.512 --> 10:47.948
still usable cheat codes.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.049
(acid gurgles)

10:49.082 --> 10:51.318
So, uh--just--is the--
is the plan

10:51.351 --> 10:53.153
to just...

10:53.186 --> 10:54.688
throw everything I own
into acid?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.389
- No, not everything's
gonna fit.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.725
- Right.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.992
- You have to take care
of the big boy.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.061
- The big--
No!

11:01.094 --> 11:02.896
Not my old futon.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.065
Futy is one
of my favorite things.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.366
Plus, he turns into a bed,

11:06.399 --> 11:08.368
so he's like
two things.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.569
- We have to dismember him.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.204
- Jesus.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.239
- Start with the legs.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.340
- (whines softly)

11:13.373 --> 11:14.908
Uh...

11:14.942 --> 11:16.977
Ah, man.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.078
(dramatic music pounds)

11:18.111 --> 11:19.579
- It's not coming out, man.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.915
The Sriracha's not coming out!

11:21.949 --> 11:23.516
(futon squirts)

11:23.550 --> 11:24.651
- Ugh, okay.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.019
I think I'm gonna throw up.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.320
- Don't you go soft on me now.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.322
We're almost out of the woods.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.323
(playful music)

11:30.357 --> 11:31.591
- Aah!

11:31.624 --> 11:32.692
- Robin.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.261
(door creaks)

11:34.294 --> 11:37.264
(sinister music pounds)

11:37.297 --> 11:38.531
*

11:38.565 --> 11:40.233
- Uh...

11:40.267 --> 11:41.234
I...

11:41.268 --> 11:43.536
got here early, so...

11:43.570 --> 11:45.372
I walked around the block
for a while.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.441
But I have this ice cream cake,
and I didn't want it to melt,

11:48.475 --> 11:50.577
so I thought I could
put it in your freezer

11:50.610 --> 11:52.612
and walk around the block
some more until

11:52.645 --> 11:54.181
Megan and Chris arrive,
but...

11:54.214 --> 11:56.083
I should have texted first.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.951
I didn't mean
to interrupt anything!

11:57.985 --> 11:58.986
(thud)

12:00.587 --> 12:02.422
- Shit, she's awake.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.292
- I didn't see anything.
I swear!

12:05.325 --> 12:07.861
I won't tell Megan
about the stained rug

12:07.895 --> 12:09.196
or the Big Mouth Billy Bass.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.263
- Nope, in the water.
On three.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.298
One.
- Oh, pl--please.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.299
- Shut up.
Two.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.967
- Oh, shit!

12:14.001 --> 12:16.870
Oh, (bleep), oh, goddamn,
shit, (bleep), (bleep)!

12:16.904 --> 12:18.105
- And...
- Okay, wait a second.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.940
Okay, this--
this is a bit much, look.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.274
I think we're going
a bit crazy.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.710
I mean, I know I don't live
in the Taj Mahal.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.312
Uh, but is my apartment
really so bad

12:25.345 --> 12:27.747
that you have to murder one
of your friends because of it?

12:27.781 --> 12:29.917
(rapid footsteps)

12:29.950 --> 12:31.284
- Damn it.
She's getting away.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.920
- What?
Holy (bleep).

12:32.953 --> 12:34.054
(gunshots)

12:34.087 --> 12:36.323
- (yelps)
(moans)

12:36.356 --> 12:39.392
(grunts)
- Ah.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.994
- It's fine.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.762
If the currents don't get her,
the sharks will.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.965
- (groaning)
(ship horn blares)

12:48.335 --> 12:50.103
- (sighs)

12:54.842 --> 12:57.077
- Okay.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.745
Oh, this place
looks so much better.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.613
We got a couple minutes
before Megan comes over,

13:00.647 --> 13:01.681
so we can--

13:01.714 --> 13:02.916
Are you leaving?

13:02.950 --> 13:06.686
- Yeah, uh...

13:06.719 --> 13:08.755
I-I just don't really
feel like being here right now.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.290
(tender music)
- What? Why?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.159
- Uh, 'cause you spent
all day freaking out

13:12.192 --> 13:15.162
over what a dump
my place is, so...

13:15.195 --> 13:17.697
- I-I just--I wanted
people to like our apartment.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.632
- Uh, you mean
you wanted people

13:19.666 --> 13:21.768
to like your apartment.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.769
- Where you going?

13:22.802 --> 13:23.937
- Uh, to Mike's.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.373
*

13:30.143 --> 13:31.811
(somber guitar music)

13:37.184 --> 13:39.186
*

13:41.588 --> 13:42.923
(cell phone chimes)

13:48.495 --> 13:50.397
- Okay, so I'm not King Fancy

13:50.430 --> 13:52.632
with a leather couch
and a diamond chair.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.568
Apparently, that makes me
a loser.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.804
- Sucks, bro.
- It does, man.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.506
She just clearly
doesn't accept me

13:59.539 --> 14:00.840
the way that I am.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.742
- Well, I do.
- Really?

14:02.775 --> 14:05.345
- For real, you're my brother,
and I love you, man.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.579
All these guys love you.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.415
(regal music and swordplay
on TV)

14:08.448 --> 14:10.750
We love you and accept you
just the way you are.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.219
- Hey.
- Here.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.853
- Thanks, boys.
- Yeah.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.455
- I appreciate that.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.759
(knocking)

14:21.461 --> 14:23.530
- Oh, hey, Liz.
- Hey, Lucy.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.697
Is Josh here?

14:24.731 --> 14:25.865
He left his retainer
at our parents' house.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.567
- Oh, um, no.
I can take that.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.936
Okay.
- Wow.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.004
- He's actually not here.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.439
He's kind of mad at me.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.607
I got rid of a bunch
of his stuff.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.776
- You got rid of Futy.
- Yeah.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.746
- Thank God.
That thing was nasty.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.348
- I mean, I guess.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.616
I, um--I just--I think
I really upset him.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.252
And I feel like a jerk.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.619
- He'll get over it.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.721
Wow.
Where is Josh, anyway?

14:48.755 --> 14:49.957
- He's with Mike.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.292
(suspenseful music)
- Mike?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.726
- Yeah, they're probably just

14:53.760 --> 14:55.295
blowing off steam or something;
I don't know.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.729
- Lucy, listen to me.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.531
Mike is very dangerous.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.866
- Really?
I-I met him once.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.301
He seems cool.
- Yeah.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.869
That's the problem.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.205
He's extremely charismatic.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.574
He lures boyfriends in
when they're feeling vulnerable

15:07.607 --> 15:09.276
and makes them feel accepted.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.644
But it's all just
so that he can control them.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.746
Before long, they're
his brainwashed followers

15:13.780 --> 15:15.548
doing whatever he tells them.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.217
(sighs)

15:17.250 --> 15:19.319
- Shoot.

15:19.352 --> 15:23.423
All right.
Where do they usually hang out?

15:23.456 --> 15:24.491
- These days?

15:24.524 --> 15:27.494
(ominous music)

15:27.527 --> 15:28.962
Guyana.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.999
(airplane engine roars)

15:34.267 --> 15:37.270
(insects droning)
(birds chirping)

15:40.040 --> 15:42.675
- My bros, my bros.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.477
Your girlfriends
don't accept you.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.013
They want to change you.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.681
They want to make your apartment
look more "adult."

15:48.715 --> 15:51.518
(men booing)

15:51.551 --> 15:54.854
They want to make you
a new dude. But I accept you

15:54.887 --> 15:57.757
as the dude that you are.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.494
And I love you unconditionally.
No homo.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.595
- We love you, dude.
- You the man.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.331
- Yeah.
- You the man, Mike!

16:04.364 --> 16:05.465
- No homo.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.000
- Aah!
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.436
- Jesus--what--what are you--
Lucy, what are you doing here?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.803
- I miss you.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.672
Why don't--
why don't we go home?

16:12.705 --> 16:14.841
- Because
Guyana's my home.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.610
Look, Mike accepts me
the way that I am, all right?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.713
He never--he never had
any problems with my apartment.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.950
- Okay, Josh.
Josh, listen.

16:23.983 --> 16:28.021
I am so, so sorry
about how I acted, all right?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.989
I-I was worried
about impressing my friends.

16:30.023 --> 16:33.693
I didn't think about
how it might make you feel.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.662
- You--

16:35.695 --> 16:37.897
you threw away my futon
without even asking me.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.632
- Yeah.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.000
- And it folds into a bed,

16:41.034 --> 16:43.036
so it's like
you threw away two things.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.871
- Yeah, I know.
I'm so sorry.

16:44.904 --> 16:48.375
- Well, I hope your friends
at least liked the apartment.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.411
- Well, I--
I told them not to come.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.380
There wasn't any point
if you weren't there with me.

16:53.413 --> 16:57.550
(soft guitar music)

16:57.584 --> 16:58.685
- A girlfriend!

16:58.718 --> 16:59.719
- Hey--oh, right.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.421
- A girlfriend among us!

17:01.454 --> 17:03.022
We have been infiltrated!

17:03.056 --> 17:04.023
- Hello.
(laughs nervously)

17:04.057 --> 17:06.859
- Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!

17:06.893 --> 17:08.561
This place is too dope!

17:08.595 --> 17:11.364
They can't let it last!

17:11.398 --> 17:13.700
There's only one option left.

17:13.733 --> 17:14.734
Get the Kool-Aid.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.336
(men cheering)
- Yeah!

17:16.369 --> 17:17.837
- Now mix it with the vodka.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.873
Quickly, now. Shots, my bros!
It is the only way.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.609
(slamming podium)
We must do shots!

17:22.642 --> 17:23.743
(men clamoring)

17:23.776 --> 17:25.878
Shots, shots, shots, shots!

17:25.912 --> 17:27.714
The younger bros first,
then the eldest.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.349
- Do you want
to get out of here?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.017
- Well, you--you don't want
to hang out with Mike anymore?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.252
- Uh...

17:32.285 --> 17:35.122
- Oh, mother, mother, mother,
mother, please.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.424
- No, let's--
let's go back to my place.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.691
- Okay.
- Um...

17:38.725 --> 17:39.859
*

17:39.892 --> 17:42.061
Let's go back to our place.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.430
- Okay.
- All right.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.132
*

17:49.502 --> 17:53.039
(laughter)
(upbeat music over stereo)

17:53.072 --> 17:55.308
- Well, hey, sick
housewarming party, bro.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.444
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.312
Sorry I got a little crazy
the other day.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.547
- That's absolutely fine.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.150
Every--everything turn out
okay, though?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.384
- No.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.386
*

18:06.419 --> 18:08.221
- To his bone,
sliced it to the bone.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.656
Hi.
- I was just telling Lucy

18:09.689 --> 18:11.658
the apartment looks amazing.
- Thank you.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.127
- Yeah, super interesting
decor choices.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.496
I haven't seen a lava lamp
since middle school.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.731
- Thank you.
I really like it.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.334
- Like it?
(door opens)

18:21.368 --> 18:23.270
*

18:23.303 --> 18:25.472
- Robin!

18:25.505 --> 18:27.340
- Hi.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.341
- Where have you been?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.742
- What happened to your arm?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.111
- Yes, Robin,
what happened to your arm?

18:32.145 --> 18:33.180
- Uh, I...

18:33.213 --> 18:35.282
I, uh...

18:36.483 --> 18:39.452
I...

18:39.486 --> 18:41.254
I don't know?

18:41.288 --> 18:42.722
- You don't know?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.695
(raucous laughter)

18:48.728 --> 18:50.830
- Robin, you're crazy!

18:50.863 --> 18:52.465
- I like this girl.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.334
- Normal.
Everything's normal.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.335
- Ah!

18:55.368 --> 18:56.603
- Is this the new futon?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.471
- Yes, it is, in fact.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.006
We just bought it together.
It's my new favorite thing.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.774
- And--and you know
it turns into a bed?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.710
- So really,
it's like two things.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.545
- A couch that turns
into a bed?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.013
Yeah, I'll believe it
when I see it.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.315
- Yeah, right?
All right, watch this.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.382
- Oh, oh, oh, okay.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.550
- Okay.
- All right, ready?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.551
- All right.
- Okay?

19:11.584 --> 19:12.785
- On three.
- Yep.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.187
- One...
- One...

19:14.221 --> 19:16.456
both: Two, three!

19:16.489 --> 19:18.157
(all cheering)

19:18.191 --> 19:20.227
- Very nice!
- Okay.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.961
(Caveman's "Never Going Back")

19:21.994 --> 19:24.697
- * Changed my mind

19:24.731 --> 19:27.234
* Just to see what's new

19:27.267 --> 19:29.068
* I wanna do what's right

19:29.101 --> 19:32.372
* Just to make it through

19:32.405 --> 19:35.708
* Till I'm wide awake

19:35.742 --> 19:38.545
* And the feeling's gone

19:38.578 --> 19:42.315
* Just a lie
that leads me back again *

19:42.349 --> 19:44.417
*

19:44.451 --> 19:46.085
* Ooh, ooh

19:46.118 --> 19:49.556
* Never going back again

19:49.589 --> 19:51.758
* Ooh, ooh

19:51.791 --> 19:53.092
* Never going back again
