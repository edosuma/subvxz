WEBVTT

00:23.458 --> 00:25.068
Thank you, Supergirl.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.417
You're welcome.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.042
-Gracias,Supergirl.
-De nada.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.201
Please welcome
President Marsdin.

01:11.245 --> 01:14.900
Good morning. I'm happy
to take any questions.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.773
I'm sorry I'm late,
but I come bearing gifts.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.516
-Kasnia.

01:21.559 --> 01:24.214
-Madam President.
Madam President.
-Miss Danvers.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.129
You're about to
hold a summit
at Camp David

01:26.173 --> 01:28.305
on the anniversary
of the Alien Amnesty Act.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.046
Can you say a few words about

01:30.090 --> 01:32.004
what this legislation
has meant to you
the past three years?

01:32.048 --> 01:36.792
Of course.
The impact has been
far-reaching and profound.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.099
You are really good
at multitasking.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.319
-Some might call it "super."

01:42.363 --> 01:45.496
For the first time in my life,
I've got everything
under control.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.560
We're training, people.
Never charge without a plan.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.171
Jensen, right?

02:08.215 --> 02:09.694
Yes, Director Danvers.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.305
Let's dance.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.356
Again.

02:33.414 --> 02:36.808
Director Danvers,
President Marsdin is arriving
for her yearly visit.

02:36.852 --> 02:37.853
When?

02:37.896 --> 02:39.202
Uh, now.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.247
What?

02:42.249 --> 02:43.424
Uh...

02:43.467 --> 02:46.122
Wow, uh, Madam President.
What a surprise.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.384
So it seems.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.038
Yes, um, if you could
just give me a minute

02:49.081 --> 02:51.388
then I can, uh,
get cleaned up
and we can chat.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.783
Agent Dox was supposed
to give me a warning
before you arrived.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.439
I believe I did.
Right before she entered.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.659
Was that not enough?

03:01.703 --> 03:05.185
I just wanted to say,
with Superman
off-world on Argo,

03:05.228 --> 03:07.665
your team and Supergirl
have been doing

03:07.709 --> 03:10.625
a tremendous job
keeping this planet safe.

03:10.668 --> 03:14.237
And I also wanted to say
I think that J'onn J'onzz

03:14.281 --> 03:18.372
made a very wise choice
when he chose you
as his successor.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.853
Thank you. That...
That means a lot to me.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.464
Since you're here
I would love
to give you a tour,

03:23.507 --> 03:24.987
show you some of the changes
that I've made.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.684
-Well, I'd like that.
-Okay.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.821
The way you pushed
the President

03:32.864 --> 03:36.346
about her alien
delegation selection
was perfect.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.696
A reporter's job
is to demand transparency.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.524
And with that said,
I'd like you to talk

03:40.568 --> 03:42.396
to the cub reporters
who are starting today
about that.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.658
-Sure.
-Yeah.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.138
And didn't Cat Grant
recommend one to you?

03:46.182 --> 03:48.619
Yes, her name
is Nia Nal.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.621
Well, Nia Nal's gonna
need a mentor like you.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.406
You're incredible,
you know that?

03:52.449 --> 03:53.972
Everything you're going
through right now,

03:54.016 --> 03:56.497
the DA possibly indicting you
for being Guardian,

03:56.540 --> 03:58.716
and here you are,
worrying about cub reporters.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.805
That's because
he leaves the worrying
about the DA to me.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.634
You're back.
Oh, how was Metropolis?

04:03.678 --> 04:07.899
Oh, well, I am very happy
to report that Sam is doing
amazing at L-Corp Northeast.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.946
She has made
two acquisitions that are
already turning a profit.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.687
She's coaching
Ruby's soccer team.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.907
-Oh.
-Apparently, they're playing
a 4-3-3 with the Gegenpress,

04:15.951 --> 04:17.779
and Ruby's playing
as sweeper keeper.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.607
I have no idea
what that means.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.305
I think
it means they're living
happily ever after.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.091
Well, I'll leave
you two alone.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.442
There's an article
about an alien summit
I have to write.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.142
-I have missed you.
-Me too.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.673
James, I'm worried about
this thing with the DA.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.155
Mmm-hmm.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.331
Listen, I know
you have your strategy,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.246
but I was speaking
to my friends
in the Mayor's office,

04:50.290 --> 04:53.467
and they said
the only path out of this
is to use some leverage.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.338
They think the DA
can be swayed.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.948
-So I was thinking
that maybe I...
-Lena, please.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.515
I don't want you pulling
any strings for me.

04:58.559 --> 05:01.213
You've tried really hard
to separate yourself

05:01.257 --> 05:02.911
from the criminal element
in your family.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.001
Don't get mixed up in this.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.307
We'll handle the DA.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.660
Look, I love the fact
that you want to fight for me.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.053
I do.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.885
But the only thing
that I need right now
is you by my side.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.715
Hi. My name's Kesse Kay
and I'm Aquarian.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.196
-Hi, Kesse Kay. Welcome.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.545
I'm Fiona.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.678
What brings you
to our group today?

05:30.721 --> 05:33.463
I guess
I'm just happy today

05:33.507 --> 05:35.073
and I wanted to share it.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.032
For the first time
since I've been
on this planet,

05:37.075 --> 05:38.294
I feel like I fit in.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.340
And it's 'cause of this.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.473
An image inducer.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.780
You're not the only one
who's purchased one recently.

05:45.823 --> 05:49.044
Bought it last week,
applied for a job
and I actually got it.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.741
All 'cause I look normal
for once.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.178
Who decides what's normal?

05:53.222 --> 05:55.746
Why should we have to wear
these devices that
change our appearance

05:55.790 --> 05:58.227
so that we can be tolerated?
I have these tusks.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.098
Why should I hide them?

06:00.142 --> 06:02.623
Well, that's easy for you
to say. You just look
like a Tolkien fan.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
You haven't been
job hunting for six months

06:06.670 --> 06:09.107
and then been called a roach
by your interviewer.

06:09.151 --> 06:12.154
It's not easy
for any of us, young man.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.417
Dr. Vose has had
his own struggles.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.638
But his research
in nuclear physics
is widely admired.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.771
And he's used his platform
to become a great advocate
for change.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.860
We all must have
the courage to be seen.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.865
We each do the best we can
in our own way.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.998
See you all next week.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.050
Can I help you?

06:48.190 --> 06:49.365
Rough day, huh?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.331
Please don't!

06:59.375 --> 07:01.421
Would you believe me
if I told you this is
no fun for me either?

07:08.297 --> 07:09.907
Well, maybe a little
bit of fun.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.831
Wouldn't want you
all lopsided now,
would we?

07:20.875 --> 07:22.224
-You are such a child.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.450
Access granted.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.282
I don't think
he wants you going in there.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.001
I didn't think
you needed more of a heads-up

08:00.044 --> 08:01.611
that the President
was arriving.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.352
You're good on your feet.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.268
True, I process terabytes
in microseconds,

08:06.311 --> 08:08.400
but you're not
so slow yourself.

08:08.444 --> 08:11.012
You don't process
as fast as you think you do.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.450
Because I've been
telling you for months
to warn me in advance

08:14.494 --> 08:16.147
when things are important.

08:17.801 --> 08:21.065
Like Supergirl just cratered
at Vose Laboratory?

08:21.109 --> 08:23.241
-I'll assemble a strike team.
-There's no time.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.243
Long live the legion!

08:25.287 --> 08:26.810
No... Brainy!

08:30.422 --> 08:32.250
-I thought you could
use some backup.
-Brainy.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.949
It is I.
You're free now, Supergirl.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.429
The cuffs are still...

08:37.473 --> 08:39.170
-Oh.
-I was multitasking.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.481
You're welcome.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.178
Got it.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.534
-No!

09:06.371 --> 09:07.808
Dr. Vose.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.986
I came as soon as I heard.
Are you all right?

09:12.029 --> 09:13.944
They cut off my tusks, J'onn.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.862
Maybe I was wrong.
None of us are safe.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.996
J'onn, what are you
doing here?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.695
Dr. Vose is a friend of mine.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.262
I heard the attack
on the news.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.699
He's an outspoken advocate
for alien rights,

09:31.788 --> 09:34.356
and most likely
the target of a hate crime.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.618
This wasn't
a hate crime, J'onn.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.446
This was a high-level robbery.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.274
These criminals
were professionals.

09:39.317 --> 09:43.321
They brought gravity cuffs,
they stole an EMP
from Dr. Vose's lab.

09:43.365 --> 09:46.716
If they blow that thing,
it could take out
the entire power grid.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.545
They cut off
his tusks, Supergirl.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.286
The very thing that
distinguishes him as an alien.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.331
Yeah, to trick
a biometric scan.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.246
Look, I've been living
amongst the people,

09:55.290 --> 09:57.509
getting a feel for
what's been going on.

09:57.553 --> 10:01.426
There's a fresh wave
of anti-alien sentiment.
I can feel it.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.386
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened
to your friend,

10:04.429 --> 10:06.649
but I think, in this case,

10:06.693 --> 10:09.217
the fact that he's an alien
is just happenstance.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.569
I'm late for CatCo,
but Brainy's on the case

10:13.613 --> 10:15.397
and we will find them,
I promise.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.441
All right.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.837
I'm back,
having assisted Supergirl,

10:20.881 --> 10:22.839
which was highly rewarding.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.450
I'm very happy
you were able to help.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.583
But we seem to be having
a communication problem.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.586
Oh, no, I assure you
I understand every word
that comes out of your mouth.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.240
Yes.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.590
But you are not
comprehending it.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.374
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
spent the last three months

10:36.418 --> 10:39.290
acting like a grain
of sand in my boot.

10:39.334 --> 10:42.380
Oh. I guess that
does sound annoying.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.078
Yes. Every time
I tell you to do something,

10:44.121 --> 10:46.820
you either do too little
or too much.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.953
-Yes, but I felt--
-This isn't the Legion.

10:49.997 --> 10:53.522
Okay, you don't get to just
go rogue whenever
you feel like it.

10:53.565 --> 10:57.787
So from now on,
you don't leave this building,

10:57.831 --> 11:01.617
you don't breathe
unless I tell you to.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.445
Is that understood?

11:05.403 --> 11:07.144
-Affirmative.
-Good.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.324
May I breathe now?

11:17.546 --> 11:19.679
Excuse me, sorry.
Hold the elevator!

11:19.722 --> 11:20.984
Excuse me.
Hold the elevator!

11:21.028 --> 11:22.725
I got it.
-Thank you.

11:22.769 --> 11:23.770
Thank you.

11:24.553 --> 11:27.991
Oh, I am so late.

11:28.035 --> 11:32.343
You know, the crazy thing
is I am always punctual.
Always.

11:32.387 --> 11:35.477
But the one day it matters,
my new roommate took
the keys to my rental car.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.175
Accidentally, of course.
And then I had to
take the bus,

11:38.219 --> 11:40.525
and I spilled coffee
all over my skirt.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.311
And all I wanted to do
was make a good
first impression on Miss...

11:45.443 --> 11:48.229
Danvers. It's you.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.101
Uh, it's Kara.
And do I know you?

11:51.145 --> 11:53.408
Um...
Kara Danvers.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.105
Kara Danvers. Wow. Um...

11:55.715 --> 11:57.064
-I'm Nia Nal.
-Oh, Nia.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.761
Nia, it's so nice
to meet you.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.937
Cat says amazing things
about you.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.156
-Yeah.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.158
-Oh, the coffee's for you.
-Oh, thanks.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.160
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.205
You're a reporter.
You don't have to
get me coffee.

12:08.249 --> 12:11.643
Oh, I know, um,
but Miss Grant mentioned
you like lattes

12:11.687 --> 12:13.341
so I thought
I'd pick one up.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.169
She said you were particular
about the temperature,

12:15.212 --> 12:16.866
so I had it all
perfectly planned out,

12:16.910 --> 12:20.043
but then my plan
went haywire,
no thanks to my roommate,

12:20.087 --> 12:21.610
and I, uh...

12:22.698 --> 12:25.222
It's probably
too cold by now.
I'm sorry.

12:25.701 --> 12:26.833
Oh, my God.

12:28.617 --> 12:29.923
You're me.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.100
-Yeah, totally. It's...

12:34.101 --> 12:35.232
-It's unnerving.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.495
How am I you?

12:37.539 --> 12:40.107
Am I... Am I being you now?
I can totally stop
whatever it is.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.544
I just wanna be good
at my job.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.198
Hey, no, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.
Let's just...

12:44.938 --> 12:46.374
Let's get into the meeting.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.728
Hello.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.861
Got another update
from the DA's office.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.428
Things are looking
worse for Olsen.
Thought you'd want to know.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.865
Thank you.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.614
That thing
hits my hard drives,

13:09.658 --> 13:12.617
it'll be family vacation 1996
all over again.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.054
Only this time,

13:14.097 --> 13:15.403
the paramedics won't be there
to resuscitate you.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.448
Buzzkill.

13:17.492 --> 13:20.712
I see the good doctor
was amiable.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.629
Vose took some convincing,

13:24.673 --> 13:26.370
but yes.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.459
And then Supergirl
showed up.

13:28.503 --> 13:29.983
And the EMP?

13:34.639 --> 13:38.165
Let him who desires peace
prepare for war.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.482
Miss Danvers... Kara.

13:52.614 --> 13:53.963
You wanted to see me?

13:54.007 --> 13:55.878
Yeah, I was just checking in.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.402
I know James asked
the new reporters to pitch in
a list of story ideas.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.013
-Yes.

14:00.056 --> 14:03.016
Uh, the feature
on National City's
new fashion district.

14:03.799 --> 14:04.887
Really?

14:06.236 --> 14:08.282
You don't think
it's a good idea?

14:08.325 --> 14:10.414
It's fine. It's just
I read on your resume

14:10.458 --> 14:13.461
that you have a degree
in International Relations
from Georgetown.

14:13.504 --> 14:16.159
Are you sure you don't
want to do something
with a little more heft?

14:16.203 --> 14:18.683
But there's nothing slight
about fashion, Kara.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.338
It's one of the most
visceral forms of art.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.864
What we choose to wear
tells a story about
who we are.

14:24.907 --> 14:28.084
Whether you wear
black and leather
or pastels and silk,

14:28.128 --> 14:31.261
you're creating
an inner version of yourself

14:31.305 --> 14:33.350
whether you realize it
or not.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.526
Never really thought
about clothes that way.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.007
Well, what makes this story
so exciting

14:38.051 --> 14:42.229
is that the fashion district's
setting up shop
in the middle of East City.

14:42.272 --> 14:45.188
New legislation is allowing
designers to live

14:45.232 --> 14:48.539
and to work in
industrial spaces that have
been abandoned for decades.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.803
An area that's been
a hotbed for crime

14:51.847 --> 14:55.895
is going to be infused
with color and life.

14:55.938 --> 14:59.333
I just think of
all the kids growing up
in that neighborhood,

14:59.376 --> 15:02.336
all the new job opportunities
that'll be created.

15:02.379 --> 15:05.382
The fashion district article
I wanna write about

15:06.079 --> 15:07.515
isn't about clothes,

15:07.558 --> 15:11.432
it's about community
and growth.

15:12.563 --> 15:13.956
And hope.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.569
You need to pitch the article
exactly like that to James.

15:18.613 --> 15:19.744
He's gonna love it.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.659
-Yeah.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.923
Well, thank you very much.

15:30.538 --> 15:33.106
-Definitely not me.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.630
I was grounded
by Director Danvers.

15:35.673 --> 15:39.025
But while I was
chained to my desk,
not literally,

15:39.068 --> 15:42.419
I stitched together various
images from surveillance
at Vose's lab and ran them.

15:42.463 --> 15:47.120
The images were rudimentary
and brought up 754,231
potential suspects.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.991
I cross-checked each image
with known associates

15:49.035 --> 15:50.862
and narrowed identification
down to two.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.648
Otis and Mercy Graves.

15:53.691 --> 15:54.997
A brother and sister team.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.130
-Negative.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.915
However, I was able
to identify an ex-employer

15:59.959 --> 16:02.091
who might be able
to help you with an address.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.353
Who's that?

16:05.268 --> 16:06.878
Miss Luthor,
you have a visitor.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.536
Lena.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.018
Oh, dear.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.933
I hope I didn't have
that same expression

16:17.977 --> 16:19.456
when you showed up
this afternoon.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.807
No, Mother, your face was
a mask of enigma as usual.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.896
It's what keeps me
looking young.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.115
What are you doing here?

16:26.159 --> 16:27.943
Funny, I could ask you
the same question.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.642
I need to find
Mercy and Otis Graves.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.384
They worked for Lex.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.170
And then for you.
Cadmus.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.520
Mercy was Lex's
head of security.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.740
And then turned
State's evidence on him,
betrayed him.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.048
Put him behind bars.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.746
So you think I'd help you
as some sort of revenge?

16:51.053 --> 16:52.576
I'm not vengeful anymore.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.189
My heart's grown
several sizes in here.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.017
Says the Grinch
who stole Christmas.

17:00.932 --> 17:03.326
A few months ago
when the planet
was being terraformed

17:03.370 --> 17:04.675
by those other Kryptonians,

17:05.459 --> 17:08.201
I was in my cell,
under a mattress,

17:08.244 --> 17:10.377
hoping the ceiling
wouldn't fall and crush me.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.769
And I realized

17:12.683 --> 17:15.121
I didn't want to die alone.

17:15.164 --> 17:19.038
And if I didn't
want to die alone,
I had to change.

17:20.517 --> 17:23.564
So, what do you want to know
about the Grave siblings,

17:23.607 --> 17:25.740
besides they're monsters?

17:25.783 --> 17:27.307
A list of
every Cadmus location

17:27.350 --> 17:28.917
you think they might be
using to hide.

17:30.788 --> 17:34.227
Just domestic?
Or international?

17:39.754 --> 17:41.538
Did I get the time wrong?

17:42.409 --> 17:44.933
No. No one else showed up.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.545
After Dr. Vose was attacked,

17:49.459 --> 17:50.895
they're scared.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.510
You're from Ichthanor,
am I right?

17:56.553 --> 17:58.251
I am.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.296
Which means
you're an empath.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.908
Although,
sometimes I wish I weren't.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.956
Things like this
are why I left Ichthanor.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.610
And England,
for that matter.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.656
I can't run anymore.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.791
I've been talking to people,

18:16.834 --> 18:19.533
researching humans
who've threatened us.

18:19.576 --> 18:23.102
We're starting a patrol group
in the neighborhood
to fight back.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.235
Would you join us?

18:26.279 --> 18:30.152
Uh... I've been fighting
on the front line
for a long time now.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.329
Those days are behind me.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.505
I made a vow
to live a peaceful life,

18:35.549 --> 18:37.333
stand up for people
in a different way.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.640
Die, roaches!

18:39.683 --> 18:40.858
Get down!

18:57.179 --> 18:59.007
Supergirl.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.052
This was a hate crime,
no doubt about it.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.054
Agreed.

19:03.098 --> 19:06.101
I still believe the attack
on Dr. Vose was motivated
by anti-alien sentiment.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.059
He was a member of
a support group here.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.671
You should dig into it,
see if the two attacks
were connected.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.848
But Dr. Vose's lab was robbed
by ex-Cadmus operatives.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.764
This... This was an
explosion outside of a bar.

19:16.807 --> 19:19.419
I don't think
there's any reason
to believe they're related.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.290
I wouldn't dismiss
the possibility.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.901
I've been trying to tell you
the climate towards aliens
is changing.

19:23.945 --> 19:27.514
Yeah. Yes, I agree it is,
but for the better.

19:27.557 --> 19:31.213
And yes, there will always
be extremists like
whoever attacked the bar,

19:31.257 --> 19:35.043
but overall,
I think this country has
made incredible progress.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.566
The President
is about to celebrate

19:36.610 --> 19:38.829
the second anniversary
of the Alien Amnesty Act.

19:38.873 --> 19:43.007
For the first time on Earth,
aliens are embraced as
citizens with equal rights--

19:43.051 --> 19:44.748
Which is part
of the backlash.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.273
The assimilation with aliens
has sparked fear
among many humans.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.231
And aliens are feeling
the brunt of that anger.

19:49.275 --> 19:52.539
I'm an alien,
and I've been all over
the world recently

19:52.582 --> 19:54.323
and I have never felt
more love.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.195
Part of the reason why
you were embraced as a hero

19:56.238 --> 19:58.022
is because you present
as a human.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.981
Most aliens do not share
that privilege.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.418
I'm afraid
your experiences are not
the best barometer here.

20:02.462 --> 20:05.552
I'm embraced as a hero
because I'm good at my job.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.597
And I really don't appreciate
you questioning my judgment.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.338
I'm just trying to offer you
a different perspective.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.035
J'onn, you left the DEO.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.821
So maybe now it's time
you leave protecting
the city to me.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.003
That looked contentious.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.527
Is she always that stubborn?

20:26.964 --> 20:29.271
She wants
to remain hopeful.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.230
It's one of the things
I most admire about her.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.803
Did you finish
the fried rice?

20:39.847 --> 20:42.371
I'm sorry.
I'm stress-eating.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.419
Did you have a bad date?

20:46.462 --> 20:48.334
No, the dating,
it's actually...

20:49.335 --> 20:51.380
-It's been great.

20:51.424 --> 20:54.035
No, don't get that look
on your face like you're
gonna officiate my wedding.

20:54.078 --> 20:57.691
No, I have not met
a woman that
I'm that serious about yet,

20:57.734 --> 20:59.693
so, you know... But it's...

21:00.433 --> 21:02.435
It's good to get out there.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.784
Well, that's great.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.655
Mmm-hmm.

21:05.699 --> 21:08.223
So, why are you
scarfing the lo mein?

21:09.964 --> 21:12.358
Brainy. Oh, my God.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.403
I'm sorry,
but everything...

21:15.404 --> 21:17.276
Everything he does
just infuriates me.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.931
I know it's mean,
but it's just...

21:20.975 --> 21:23.499
Ugh, I can't help it.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.154
He's new
to this time period.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.112
It's a big adjustment.

21:28.156 --> 21:32.073
I'm sure it's been hard.
Try to go easy on him.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.292
I'll try.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.253
What about you?

21:38.732 --> 21:40.690
Me?

21:40.734 --> 21:43.476
We ordered your favorite
Chinese takeout and you
haven't even taken a bite.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.782
What's going on?

21:45.826 --> 21:47.784
I thought you were
on top of the world.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.177
I got in a fight with J'onn.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.833
-After the attack,
at the bar.

21:52.876 --> 21:56.489
He tried to convince me
that there's this

21:56.532 --> 22:00.231
hate movement against aliens.

22:00.275 --> 22:01.798
I mean, am I crazy?

22:01.842 --> 22:06.107
I feel like the world
is better than
it's ever been.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.283
More diversity,
more acceptance.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.199
Sure. I mean, in some ways.

22:11.242 --> 22:14.681
Ever since J'onn left the DEO,
I just feel so far from him.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.248
I don't really know
what his life is like.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.555
-Yeah.
-All I know is I hate
his new point of view.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.384
It feels so ominous.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.734
J'onn is not
an alarmist, Kara.

22:24.778 --> 22:27.476
I mean, if he's trying
to tell you something,
I would listen.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.608
What are you so afraid of?

22:28.651 --> 22:30.479
I'm not afraid
of anything. It...

22:33.221 --> 22:36.964
I just finally feel like
the world is good.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.271
And I so badly want it
to stay that way,

22:40.315 --> 22:42.448
even if it's just
for a little while.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.320
Kara Danvers,

22:45.364 --> 22:47.583
you are the most
courageous person I know.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.804
And even if it's hard,
if you face it,

22:50.847 --> 22:52.196
you can conquer anything.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.112
-I'll try.
-Ha.

22:55.156 --> 22:58.289
Only if you conquer
the urge to not punch
Brainy in the face.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.814
Mmm. That is
an unfair bargain.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.470
Checkmate.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.429
You just love saying
that to me, don't you?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.344
No, I've let go
of my anger, too, Mother.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.302
-I can't waste
my energy on it.
-Right.

23:11.346 --> 23:15.002
You need all your energy
to focus on saving the world.

23:15.045 --> 23:19.659
Although, all I've seen
are the commercials
of your image inducer.

23:19.702 --> 23:22.052
Making a mint
hiding aliens in plain sight.

23:22.096 --> 23:25.099
It's not political, Mother,
it's just business.

23:25.142 --> 23:28.015
It helps fund
my other research,
the important kind.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.409
Ever the pragmatist.

23:32.541 --> 23:33.847
And this visit?

23:35.326 --> 23:37.851
I know chess with me
is a good time,

23:37.894 --> 23:39.853
but the love of the game
can't be the only reason

23:39.896 --> 23:41.420
I've seen you twice
in as many days.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.031
The truth?

23:47.034 --> 23:49.602
It's James
and the looming indictment.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.995
It made me
think about my life,

23:52.039 --> 23:55.390
how much of it I've spent
living on an island.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.741
I wanna reconnect,
rebuild the relationships
that I've lost.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.571
And yes,
that does include you.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.444
For better or for worse,
you're still my mother.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.272
Things weren't always rosy,

24:09.709 --> 24:11.275
but there were
some good times.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.669
Even with Lex.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.804
It made me sad when the two
of you became enemies.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.501
If I was
still vengeful,

24:19.545 --> 24:20.676
I'd blame Superman

24:20.720 --> 24:23.070
for tearing this family apart.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.375
Okay, I'm still vengeful.

24:26.856 --> 24:29.293
I don't know
if it was all Superman.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.731
In my opinion,
it was his relationship
with Bruno Mannheim

24:31.774 --> 24:33.123
that started him
down the wrong path.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.169
That miscreant?

24:35.212 --> 24:37.693
They were
business partners, sure,

24:37.737 --> 24:40.435
but Bruno was only in it
for the money laundering.

24:40.479 --> 24:44.613
It's a shame how he used
your brother's business
and then dumped him.

24:44.657 --> 24:47.573
I didn't know
Bruno laundered money
through Luthor Corp.

24:47.616 --> 24:50.445
Is there anything in my books
I need to worry about,

24:50.489 --> 24:52.273
since you know where
all the bodies are buried?

24:53.535 --> 24:55.798
I guess it's time
I educated you.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.194
All right. Sam,
it's a smart angle
on the homeless crisis.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.500
It's all yours.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.155
All right, anybody else
want to take a crack
at fashion?

25:07.331 --> 25:12.380
My pitch is to emphasize
that National City as a global
epicenter of fashion.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.601
We dictate what's hot,
we set the trends.

25:15.644 --> 25:18.734
And we're far overdue
for a glossy new
fashion district

25:18.778 --> 25:20.867
to represent
our cultural importance.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.609
FYI, my mother
went to college
with Adrian Tyler,

25:23.652 --> 25:25.785
the most famous
living American designer, so,

25:25.828 --> 25:28.309
I have access to almost
anyone in this field
for interviews.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.919
On the record.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.922
Nice. Okay,
anybody else want to
take a crack at fashion?

25:35.621 --> 25:38.101
Going once,
going twice.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.190
MacKenzie, all yours.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.070
Brainy.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.593
I used the info you got
from Lillian Luthor

25:51.637 --> 25:53.508
and found a location
for Mercy and Otis.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.424
Would you believe
it's an abandoned warehouse?

26:10.307 --> 26:11.570
There's no one here.

26:11.613 --> 26:14.529
I had heat signatures there
30 minutes ago.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.052
I'm hacking into
the computer network.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.619
We'll scan for
potential leads.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.751
Hold on, please.

26:35.942 --> 26:38.771
"I have a lead on a Phorian
at my son's school."

26:40.642 --> 26:42.296
How to make a bomb?

26:44.951 --> 26:46.343
Earth first?

26:51.784 --> 26:53.916
Hey,
I'm glad you picked up.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.223
That weapon you sold me,
it barely burned
through the Phorians.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.878
It's Karen.

26:58.921 --> 27:01.620
Mom, Cary won't
let me use the computer.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.795
-I've got to go.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.497
Brainy,

27:10.977 --> 27:12.761
these chat rooms
on these computers...

27:12.805 --> 27:14.458
All filtered
through the dark web.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.765
ISPs originated from
all over the country.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.201
Yet untraceable.

27:18.245 --> 27:21.161
But I did find something
in a deleted e-mail cache.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.381
Blueprints of Camp David.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.080
Mercy and Otis.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.473
They're going to attack
the President's alien summit.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.917
You were right
about the crimes.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.309
They were motivated
by hate,

27:39.353 --> 27:41.224
and there's a web of people--

27:41.268 --> 27:43.705
Now that you know
what's happening,
you can fight it, Kara.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.011
But I need your help.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.231
They're going to attack
the alien summit.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.146
Help me keep it safe.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.322
And then help me take on
the rest of this movement

27:52.366 --> 27:54.760
because it is bigger than
anything I have ever fought.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.152
The people involved in it

27:56.196 --> 27:58.546
are like the people I save
every day.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.809
A villain, I know how to stop,
but these people...

28:00.853 --> 28:03.290
I'm sorry, but I cannot
fight with you.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.161
Not this time.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.903
But...
But you have to.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.688
You were the first person
to see this. You...

28:10.776 --> 28:13.082
Who yelled at me
to open my eyes!

28:13.126 --> 28:14.649
How can you not join me now?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.651
Because it's no longer
my path to fight.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.133
When my father passed,
he gave me a message.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.702
"Live as H'ronmeer taught
and promote peace."

28:24.615 --> 28:26.705
I cannot do that
whilst holding a sword.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.665
I will help those in need,

28:30.709 --> 28:33.059
and I will be
a voice for change
like Dr. Vose.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.410
I will support you, Kara.

28:37.672 --> 28:38.847
But I cannot join your battle.

28:38.891 --> 28:39.892
I'm sorry.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.602
I'm sorry, Supergirl,
but I can't.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.822
I won't cancel the summit.

28:56.865 --> 28:59.172
The Graves siblings
are dangerous operatives.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.740
I'm afraid of what
they could do to you
and your alien guests.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.046
So am I.

29:04.090 --> 29:06.570
But there's always
someone to be afraid of.

29:06.614 --> 29:11.488
Some force, some threat
that is beyond our control.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.490
And yet, we carry on.

29:15.536 --> 29:19.540
A leader who caves to fear
is no leader at all.

29:21.716 --> 29:24.937
I'll alert the Secret Service,
the DEO,
We'll co-ordinate with them.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.599
Yeah.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.601
And thanks for being here.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.429
I know you pick
your battles now.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.127
Well, it seemed like
a good battle to pick.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.653
I'm thrilled that you're here.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.611
You know this is
the first time in history

29:47.655 --> 29:51.180
that we've hosted guests
that were not born
on this planet.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.530
At least that we, uh,
know about.

29:55.489 --> 29:59.275
President Eisenhower
named it Camp David
after his son and grandson,

29:59.319 --> 30:00.799
who were both named,
of course, David.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.848
Alex. It's the EMP.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.115
Mayday, mayday!
Chopper is going down.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.335
Hey, everybody, stay calm.
Nobody move.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.684
Nobody move.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.164
Secure the perimeter.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.339
That was the EMP.

30:19.382 --> 30:20.557
Now, Agent Dox.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.255
Wavelength countermeasures
active.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.526
It worked!
Nice one, Brainy.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.919
Eureka!

30:33.962 --> 30:35.921
The lights
are blown in here.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.836
We gotta move the President
to the safe room. That was
just a distraction.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.054
Madam President.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.927
Do you think
they're inside the perimeter?

30:41.970 --> 30:43.145
I know they are.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.364
All right, take her back.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.844
You guys, go,
clear the house.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.501
Alex, they're in
DEO uniforms.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.618
Okay, is everybody
okay back there?

31:21.662 --> 31:22.837
We're good,
let's get her out.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.273
Now, go, now.

31:25.013 --> 31:26.014
You'll be fine, ma'am.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.158
-I'm fine!

31:39.201 --> 31:40.507
Just get them.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.224
Supergirl!
I know you can hear me.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.704
You filthy roach.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.924
You need to know
you won't stop this.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.534
I'm stopping you both.

32:07.577 --> 32:10.406
This isn't one of your battles
where it's good versus evil.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.365
Because we are
the good guys,

32:12.408 --> 32:14.541
fighting to save this country.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.847
We'll do whatever
it takes to win.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.855
Help!

32:25.682 --> 32:27.075
Supergirl!

32:33.125 --> 32:34.387
Whoa. Oh.

32:34.865 --> 32:35.866
Ah.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.307
You really thought

32:42.830 --> 32:44.179
my sister would kill me?

32:45.572 --> 32:47.139
You think
you stopped us tonight,

32:47.182 --> 32:49.184
but the fuse was lit.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.404
And it's gonna
be beautiful.

32:51.447 --> 32:54.276
Everyone's safe here.
The President's fine.
Did you get him?

32:54.320 --> 32:55.495
Only one.

32:58.889 --> 33:02.458
You can act as tough
as you want, but you are gonna
tell us where Mercy went.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.374
And when you do,
you're gonna wish
you had done it sooner.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.422
Just take him.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.947
God, I hate that guy.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.391
Where did you
get all that stuff?

33:23.523 --> 33:26.395
The comic book store
on Excelsior.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.354
Oh, that's right down
the street from
Winn's old apartment.

33:29.485 --> 33:32.836
And that cardigan.
Winn has the same one.

33:32.880 --> 33:33.968
Does he?

33:35.709 --> 33:37.145
All right, yes.

33:37.189 --> 33:39.147
You see, I analyzed
our recent torrent
of conflicts

33:39.191 --> 33:41.106
and I couldn't find
a common factor.

33:41.149 --> 33:42.629
I did things your way,

33:43.282 --> 33:44.370
wrong.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.937
I did things
the Legion way, wrong.

33:46.981 --> 33:48.809
I did things my way,

33:49.462 --> 33:50.767
-so very wrong.

33:53.944 --> 33:55.076
I just couldn't win.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.644
And then I realized,
that's it.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.995
I can't win
because I'm not Winn.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.998
He was your...
Your bro.

34:04.912 --> 34:05.913
I'm not him.

34:07.784 --> 34:08.785
Unless...

34:10.613 --> 34:12.920
Unless I... I am.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.706
I'm not...

34:16.750 --> 34:18.491
I'm not very good
with change.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.495
And I do miss Winn.

34:23.191 --> 34:24.366
A lot.

34:25.498 --> 34:28.109
And I guess
in some ways,
I have been

34:28.153 --> 34:30.111
punishing you
for not being him.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.852
And that is...

34:32.896 --> 34:34.159
That's not fair.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.032
I understand.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.296
I miss my friends, too.

34:42.471 --> 34:44.256
I'm sorry, I didn't
even think about that.

34:45.126 --> 34:46.519
And you left them behind.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.130
Well, technically,
they're ahead.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.566
Right. Yes.

34:50.610 --> 34:52.655
Look, either way,
we are stuck
with each other.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.136
So... No, I mean,
that's not a bad thing.

34:55.180 --> 34:58.226
It's actually a good thing.

34:58.270 --> 35:01.229
You know? We just have to...
Find our rhythm.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.146
That, I can do.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.801
I've been told
I have excellent rhythm.

35:07.844 --> 35:10.325
-No. No.
-Just let me... All right.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.066
Just no more sweaters, okay?

35:12.110 --> 35:14.721
Thank God.
These things are
restrictively tight.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.681
It was parking lots.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.857
Bruno purchased them
through a subsidiary
he bought from your brother.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.427
My mother goes on to name
five more shell companies
owned by Mannheim.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.996
You're the District Attorney.
Subpoena their books.

35:29.039 --> 35:32.565
You'll find enough RICO
violations to send Mannheim
away for as long as Al Capone.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.134
So does your mother
know you played her?

35:38.484 --> 35:39.746
She will soon.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.444
No...

35:43.228 --> 35:44.490
And your other investigation?

35:45.665 --> 35:46.927
Guardian who?

35:53.455 --> 35:55.370
Nia.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.067
What happened in
that meeting with James?

35:57.111 --> 36:00.201
Well, uh, MacKenzie pitched
her take on the article

36:00.245 --> 36:01.594
and she had
a good approach.

36:02.421 --> 36:04.074
Yours was better.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.555
You were so passionate
when you talked
to just me about it.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.209
Why'd you shut down?

36:08.253 --> 36:10.211
It was a scary room.

36:10.255 --> 36:15.738
James Olsen is the CEO
of this incredible
media empire.

36:15.782 --> 36:18.698
And MacKenzie has more
famous friends than Oprah.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.656
Nia, what really happened

36:20.700 --> 36:22.441
when MacKenzie took
that article?

36:23.181 --> 36:24.486
Why didn't you
want to compete?

36:27.315 --> 36:29.187
I guess, in the moment,

36:30.623 --> 36:32.146
I was afraid to make waves.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.800
Okay. Fear.

36:34.975 --> 36:36.716
I get that.

36:36.759 --> 36:39.327
No matter how much
we believe in ourselves,
that never goes away.

36:39.371 --> 36:40.676
Not fully.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.811
Even now, I think
I'm not afraid of anything.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.466
And then,
something new and ugly
rears its head,

36:47.509 --> 36:49.424
and chases me right back down
the rabbit hole.

36:50.425 --> 36:53.167
But once we catch ourselves,

36:53.211 --> 36:55.604
we have to jump
right back out there.

36:58.041 --> 37:00.522
So, you're afraid to
make waves?

37:01.175 --> 37:03.351
Okay. Make 'em anyway.

37:04.787 --> 37:06.136
Make a tsunami.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.664
-You're right.
-Of course I am.

37:11.707 --> 37:14.623
Acknowledge the fear,
then kick its ass.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.018
-Thank you, Kara.
-Don't thank me.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.846
Just get out there
and kick up a storm.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.153
Come on, seriously.
Time's a-wasting.

37:23.589 --> 37:24.590
Ticktock.

37:27.114 --> 37:28.681
You realize you're
turning into Cat, right?

37:28.724 --> 37:30.465
What? No.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.772
To a tee. It's kind of
freaking me out.
You just said "ticktock."

37:32.815 --> 37:34.643
You might as well
have said "chop chop."

37:34.687 --> 37:36.689
-Yeah, you did.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.694
We have
breaking news. All charges
against James Olsen...

37:41.737 --> 37:43.086
Oh, my God.
-...will be dropped.

37:43.130 --> 37:44.523
-James.
-More as this story develops.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.617
See? Told you there was
nothing to worry about.

37:54.446 --> 37:56.317
I am so happy, James.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.797
Me too.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.713
And thank you
for standing by my side

38:00.756 --> 38:02.758
and letting me
handle this by myself.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.066
I never doubted
you could handle it.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.721
I only offered
because I've lost so much
of my family to prison,

38:08.764 --> 38:10.549
it's turned my life
and my relationships
upside down

38:10.592 --> 38:12.899
and I couldn't bear
the thought of that
happening to you.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.379
It won't.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.511
Yes, we will not
be indicting James Olsen

38:16.555 --> 38:18.948
for past allegations
of obstruction.

38:18.992 --> 38:22.604
However, if Mr. Olsen
were to resume his role
as Guardian

38:22.648 --> 38:24.650
he will be subject
to immediate arrest.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.831
On a separate investigation,

38:31.874 --> 38:35.356
our office has uncovered
new evidence in the State's
case against Bruno Mannheim.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.402
We will be
reissuing the indictment

38:37.445 --> 38:40.492
which will include
several counts
of money laundering.

38:40.535 --> 38:41.797
There you have it,

38:41.841 --> 38:43.059
District Attorney Diaz
reiterating...

39:00.903 --> 39:03.123
So, about yesterday...

39:04.559 --> 39:06.082
I know how much
it means to you

39:06.126 --> 39:08.607
to honor your father's wishes.

39:08.650 --> 39:11.087
And I shouldn't have
asked you to compromise that.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.134
Look, I know the last few days

39:14.177 --> 39:15.309
have been difficult for you.

39:16.223 --> 39:18.878
I'm just sorry
I made it even more so.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.923
The thought of
so much anger out there is...

39:23.186 --> 39:24.666
It's not what I wanted
to believe was true.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.626
I thought this country...

39:27.669 --> 39:30.019
That we were
in a better place.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.328
The idea of having
to fight something so vast,

39:35.721 --> 39:37.026
trying to unite

39:37.070 --> 39:39.159
such a divided world, it's...

39:40.682 --> 39:42.118
It's overwhelming.

39:44.207 --> 39:46.732
It's your optimism that
will help save us, Kara.

39:46.775 --> 39:49.256
You're the beacon of hope
who sets an example,

39:50.083 --> 39:52.868
fighting for justice
everywhere.

39:53.695 --> 39:56.219
The voice of unity
and compassion

39:56.263 --> 39:57.743
that will inspire change.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.617
I feel like
I don't know anything.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.055
Then you are wiser
than you realize.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.233
We now take you to a late-breaking news story.

40:10.277 --> 40:14.324
Shocking footage acquired
from the assassination
attempt at Camp David

40:14.368 --> 40:17.023
has revealed that
the President is an alien.

40:17.066 --> 40:21.070
This confirms
what many thought to be the ravings of a fringe group.

40:21.114 --> 40:25.074
Experts have authenticated
the footage and found
no signs of doctoring.

40:25.118 --> 40:28.600
The President
of the United States
is an alien.

40:28.643 --> 40:29.949
"The fuse was lit."

40:34.388 --> 40:35.650
Al, is Fiona here?

40:35.694 --> 40:37.870
No, she didn't show up
for her shift.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.749
These accusations
seem to be true.

40:47.793 --> 40:50.143
This all points
to the cold hard truth

40:50.186 --> 40:53.581
that our current
sitting president
is an alien.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.148
You do good work.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.151
What can I say?

40:59.892 --> 41:02.329
I love my country.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.596
We didn't ask
for you to come here.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.120
You brought this
on yourself.

41:12.687 --> 41:14.123
Who are you?

41:19.346 --> 41:22.001
An agent of liberty.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.975
[men speaking
in other language]
