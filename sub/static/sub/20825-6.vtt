00:08.132 --> 00:11.804
I, Claire Hale Underwood,
do solemnly swear

00:11.887 --> 00:16.767
that I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States...

00:16.850 --> 00:20.103
-[speaking indistinctly]
-I'm proud of her. She deserves this.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.315
Even if it only lasts
for a couple of weeks.

00:23.398 --> 00:27.485
And will, to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect, and defend

00:27.570 --> 00:30.531
the Constitution of the United States,
so help me God.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.076
[camera shutter clicking]

00:35.035 --> 00:38.121
Congratulations, Madam Acting President.

[theme music playing]

02:23.476 --> 02:25.979
-Feel different?
-No.

02:26.063 --> 02:29.524
-Liar.
-It's temporary. I'm only acting.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.736
[inhales sharply] Oh.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.575
You have to now carry this with you
at all times.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.289
-The codes?
-Mmm-hmm. It's the law.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.134
Governor, we just got word

02:56.218 --> 02:59.096
that Vice President Claire Underwood
was sworn in as acting president.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.098
-Were you aware?
-[camera shutters clicking]

03:01.181 --> 03:02.349
Of course.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.435
Do you have any comment?

03:06.812 --> 03:07.896
God bless America.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.898
[reporter 1] If Monday's House vote
goes your way,

03:09.982 --> 03:12.735
-and you win the presidency--
-Oh, I'll win, believe me. [chuckles]

03:12.818 --> 03:14.152
[reporter 2] You think this vote
will be the charm?

03:14.236 --> 03:16.864
[Conway] See, Congress is no different
than the rest of the country.

03:16.947 --> 03:21.243
People are sick and tired
of all this confusion and chaos.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.703
The public is not happy.

03:23.787 --> 03:27.833
If you become president, would
Claire Underwood remain as vice president?

03:27.916 --> 03:30.377
Not if she wants
what's best for the country. [chuckles]

03:30.460 --> 03:33.546
But given the Twelfth Amendment,
would you have a choice?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.049
[Mark] Uh, no further questions,
everybody.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.093
The governor's here to talk
to members of Congress.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.762
-Thank you so much.
-[reporters clamoring]

03:39.845 --> 03:42.055
[Mark] Thank you. Thanks, everybody.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.807
-Will?
-I'm fine.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.894
And Rasmussen changed his vote.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.022
Well, he's been waiting a long time
to pay me back.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.649
Creating a deadlock in Rhode Island
just gives him the spotlight.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.110
-He can be convinced.
-[LeAnn] Meeting's set for this afternoon.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.404
Yes, but if we can't,
we lose Rhode Island.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.907
He seems to be acting alone,
but that could change.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.616
[Doug] We will make gains this weekend.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.911
-Shore things up by Monday's vote.
-[Frank] Mmm.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.751
Mr. President, it's possible
we may need to consider the other option.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.710
A rescheduled election.

04:12.795 --> 04:16.673
No, no, I'll get Rasmussen back in line,
and turn some others along the way.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.177
[LeAnn] We've arranged sit-downs
for you and Madam President

04:20.260 --> 04:21.594
with all of the small states.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.681
LeAnn and I can go door-to-door
in Rayburn, Longworth and Cannon.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.100
Three of my favorite buildings
after this one.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.352
What is it?

04:30.145 --> 04:34.691
The McMurdo Research Facility
in Antarctica.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.195
All live feed communications have ceased
or been disconnected.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.781
However, we have been receiving
texts and e-mails

04:40.864 --> 04:43.491
from an American scientist
stationed there,

04:43.575 --> 04:48.496
claiming that an unidentified
occupying military force has landed.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.874
You think the soldiers are Russian?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.250
[Catherine] He thinks so.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.543
[inhales sharply]

04:53.626 --> 04:56.171
They arrived via
unmarked research vessels.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.382
We reached out to Moscow, but they're
denying any official involvement.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.926
[softly] Surprise, surprise.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.761
[Catherine] It's a brazen act
of aggression.

05:03.846 --> 05:04.847
Well, it's a crime of opportunity.

05:04.930 --> 05:08.100
Petrov thinks the US government
has their eye off the ball.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.810
Well, it doesn't.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.896
Cathy, what's the most recent
communication we've received?

05:12.980 --> 05:16.691
What I'm saying is this aggression
in Antarctica, by powers unknown,

05:16.774 --> 05:20.403
is a direct result of the uncertainty that
our presidential situation has wrought.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.031
Congressman Watts,
since when is Antarctica a concern

05:23.115 --> 05:24.657
for the Congressional Black Caucus?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.077
I hope you're not implying that the caucus

05:27.160 --> 05:29.496
shouldn't have a voice
in international affairs.

05:29.579 --> 05:33.041
I hope that's not what I'm hearing.
Thank you, Randy.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.294
I've called a meeting tomorrow,

05:36.378 --> 05:38.630
for the Congressional Black Caucus,
to discuss our positions,

05:38.713 --> 05:42.384
both foreign and domestic,
before Monday's presidential vote.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.552
Are you considering
shifting your support to Conway?

05:44.636 --> 05:49.057
Well, all I can say at this time,
that the most important thing is unity...

05:49.141 --> 05:52.519
and the public's faith
in the institution of democracy.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.437
That's all for now.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.982
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[indistinct chatter]

05:57.983 --> 06:00.777
[Claire over phone] <i>You are in violation</i>
<i>of the Antarctic Treaty System.</i>

06:00.860 --> 06:03.821
A treaty the USSR signed in 1959.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.367
<i>-We're a new country.</i>
-So you're admitting they are your troops.

06:07.450 --> 06:11.871
<i>I'm simply stating I need to interpret</i>
<i>agreements signed by the Soviet Union.</i>

06:11.955 --> 06:15.458
In which case, you'd be throwing out
decades of disarmament progress.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.629
The Cold War is over,
Mrs. Acting President.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.299
<i>Well, then maybe</i>
<i>we need to revisit the treaty.</i>

06:22.382 --> 06:26.511
I'm not interested in revisiting a treaty.
I'm interested in staying in power.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.638
And, Claire...

06:29.431 --> 06:32.309
<i>if I could be so familiar.</i>

06:32.392 --> 06:33.810
<i>In my country...</i>

06:34.937 --> 06:37.439
<i>once you're in office, you don't let go.</i>

06:38.815 --> 06:41.151
-Viktor.
<i>-Mr. President.</i>

06:41.901 --> 06:44.654
You Americans certainly have
a lot of presidents these days.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.450
[chuckles] <i>Yes, you may think that</i>
<i>we're distracted, but don't fool yourself.</i>

06:48.533 --> 06:53.621
Distracted? No. No, no. Divided, yes.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.541
American democracy is stronger
than your sad attempt

06:56.624 --> 06:58.961
to take advantage of a bump in the road.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.422
Oh, Francis, my eyes are on a landscape

07:02.505 --> 07:06.301
that is so much bigger
than any one of your roads.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.851
[Frank] Well, Congressman Rasmussen,
we're just surprised to see you come out

07:14.935 --> 07:17.062
on the wrong end of this, is all.

07:17.145 --> 07:21.149
I mean, I suppose it must've been hard
losing the House majority leadership

07:21.233 --> 07:22.775
all those years ago,

07:22.859 --> 07:28.115
but there is a difference between
being bitter and being treasonous.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.909
If it's new committee assignments
you'd like, we can certainly arrange that.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.286
It's over.

07:34.412 --> 07:38.708
Markets are in free fall.
Consumer confidence is at an all-time low.

07:38.791 --> 07:42.920
What is this? A doodad? A doohickey?
A... pointless award?

07:43.005 --> 07:45.632
Did I mention I hate useless things?

07:45.715 --> 07:48.218
This nation is coming apart at the seams.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.263
Because of you, because of
what you've done to this country.

07:51.346 --> 07:55.392
There it is. How the righteous love to
bemoan their role in middle management,

07:55.475 --> 07:58.478
and condemn those who actually
might have an effect on the world.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.441
-Think of the party, Congressman.
-I am.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.028
What did you think would happen
when you came in here, Francis?

08:06.111 --> 08:07.695
That you could threaten me,

08:07.779 --> 08:11.199
tell me the DNC'll throw money
at my primary opponent next cycle

08:11.283 --> 08:14.744
if I don't play ball?
Or were you gonna flatter me?

08:14.827 --> 08:18.956
"Elder of the party" this,
"bellwether senior member" that.

08:19.041 --> 08:23.670
You know, I'm somewhat delighted that you
developed a personality at this late date.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.838
But I would ask you to rethink this.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.717
To come out this way on this thing
in the twilight of your career

08:29.801 --> 08:32.679
will do nothing
but sully your Wikipedia page.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.764
You have no idea, do you?

08:35.682 --> 08:41.020
No one hears you walking the halls
of this building... not anymore.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.110
-Who are you working for?
-Excuse me?

08:47.902 --> 08:51.906
I served next to your jellied spine
for two decades.

08:51.989 --> 08:57.079
You've never shown an ounce of courage.
You don't have what it takes for revenge.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.457
So someone must have offered you
something rather sweet.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.170
Take all of the two hours
you need to reconsider.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.473
One more thing for your signature.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.240
-You can leave this with me.
-Of course.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.911
-And Miss Harvey's waiting.
-[Claire] Oh, please send her in.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.087
I'm on my way back to Rayburn. [sighs]

09:47.170 --> 09:48.838
You close the door, please?

09:54.051 --> 09:56.221
What are our chances with a revote?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.431
Or, rather,
what are the president's chances?

10:02.852 --> 10:03.895
I want to know.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.108
If it was in all 50 states, not good.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.320
His unfavorables are still high.
Yours are still not.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.698
But it's hard to argue
with close to 30 years' experience.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.993
Maybe the president is right. Maybe
he does have a better chance in the House.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.787
Don't defer, LeAnn.
Tell me what you think.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.875
The revote in Tennessee and Ohio
is his best shot.

10:25.958 --> 10:31.131
While it's what's best for Frank,
it may not be what's best for you.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.384
Thank you.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.435
[door closes]

10:43.518 --> 10:44.977
You seem like a reasonable man.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.022
I know how to listen,
if that's what you mean.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.232
If the president regains his office--

10:49.316 --> 10:52.610
"If" doesn't make
for a winning opener, Alex.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.862
I'm here because I think he can win.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.282
We often don't see eye to eye, he and I.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.410
Uh, and yet, there are ways
we can work together.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.415
Okay, maybe I made a mistake
with the committee.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.749
I can be self-righteous.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.793
I'm trying to clean up the party.
Our party.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.712
And I end up speaking out of turn.

11:10.795 --> 11:15.550
It's enough with the, "It's me, not you."
What can you deliver, Alex?

11:15.633 --> 11:19.971
-I can get out of the way.
-Well, that sounds vague and inadequate.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.809
I want to know what's up with
Terry Womack and the Black Caucus.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.730
The president and Congressman Womack,
they have a good relationship.

11:28.813 --> 11:32.650
Oh, I'm sure they do. But I would hate
to see Terry let you down.

11:35.069 --> 11:38.615
If we lose Womack and the Black Caucus,
we're done on Monday.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.743
There are a few freshmen
I could reach out to.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.745
They might help keep the CBC together.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.415
You wanna be minority whip.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.501
Only if I deserve to be.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.586
[Doug] Huh.

11:51.669 --> 11:55.798
I'm trying to get back. Congressman Lewis
is 20 minutes late as usual.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.385
Is there a spot for him
on financial services?

12:00.762 --> 12:01.971
Uh-huh.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.814
Doug, stay where you are.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.527
I thought you said
you were telling the CIA to stand down.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.988
I did. So, contrary to your assurances
that Macallan would behave,

12:19.071 --> 12:20.239
we're now dealing with a leak.

12:20.323 --> 12:23.117
-He doesn't want trouble.
-How do you know what he wants?

12:24.286 --> 12:26.078
You find him and you get him here.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.832
As soon as he knows we've backed off,
he will disappear. I promise.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.377
No, that word means nothing to me.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.592
-[knocking on door]
-[door opens]

12:41.386 --> 12:42.470
You have a statement?

12:42.554 --> 12:46.349
You anticipate any other big WikiLeaks
info dumps coming down the pike?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.436
-You'll know--
-When I need to know. I know.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.355
Which is apparently whenever it hits CNN.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.442
FBI was on high alert.
They investigated every threat.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.234
-Calm down.
-[sighs]

12:57.319 --> 13:01.197
I am calm, Doug.
The public's not calm.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.451
Every misstep is highlighted
and heightened.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.161
They wanna know
what happened with their election.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.245
We're fixing it.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.374
Yeah... that's what they're afraid of.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.628
The statement's about the FBI.
Everybody trusts the FBI.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.595
Hey, who's Lisa Williams?

13:25.972 --> 13:28.683
I don't know. Why?

13:28.766 --> 13:32.729
Oh, somebody from the <i>Herald</i> called.
They were just wondering if you knew her.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.315
I don't.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.033
I need five minutes with this.

13:48.786 --> 13:49.871
[sniffles]

13:50.955 --> 13:52.624
-Open or closed?
-Closed.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.002
[door closes]

14:10.475 --> 14:11.976
Am I good with that statement?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.103
I marked it up. It's on my desk.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.695
[panting] Throwing the election back
to the states, it gives us less certainty.

15:03.778 --> 15:06.197
[Claire] I don't think
we can get it done by Monday.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.865
We've been working at it
for weeks, Francis.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.492
Claire, don't let the office
make you careful.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.035
The halls of Congress
have never failed me.

15:11.118 --> 15:14.914
Yes, but the career politicians,
they are more entrenched than ever.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.959
There's a new House,
with members you don't know.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.087
We need to move the playing field
back to the imaginations of the people.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.215
Oh, you have that much faith
in the voters in Tennessee and Ohio?

15:24.298 --> 15:27.594
They're going to choose you.
I just know it.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.430
[panting] All right.

15:30.513 --> 15:34.141
Set up a meeting.
I'll hear them all out. You win.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.894
Both of us. Both of us.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.062
[exhales deeply]

15:38.145 --> 15:39.230
Good evening.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.523
Eric.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.735
-Feel like you're outside?
-Mmm.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.612
Aren't you supposed to
limit it to 30 minutes?

15:45.695 --> 15:48.280
-Oh, God, Jesus, no.
-Not if you calibrate the workout.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.824
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.369
It's all about listening to your body.
It'll tell you when it's time to rest.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.081
You should listen to the doctors
some of the time, Francis.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.541
[panting]

16:01.544 --> 16:02.795
[door closes]

16:05.381 --> 16:09.135
I know the Underwoods were worried.
Because they were ready to deal.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.303
To deal with me.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.682
-You're sure it's for real?
<i>-Sure as I can be.</i>

16:16.350 --> 16:18.310
Okay, we'll be in touch.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.979
Okay.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.902
[Conway] So call him back.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.531
Making progress on a couple of Dems.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.699
Think Congressman Alspaugh
is about to turn.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.325
[Mark] We'll see him on Sunday.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.954
Why wait?

16:38.956 --> 16:42.585
[Mark] We need to meet with
the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.587
They're in Underwood's pocket.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.841
Yeah. Can you give us a second, everybody?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.092
[man] Uh, sure.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.553
-Come on.
-[claps]

16:53.262 --> 16:54.889
-[Hannah sighs]
-[Mark] Thank you.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.601
[yawns]

17:02.188 --> 17:06.943
I just got word from somebody inside.
Womack is losing control of the caucus.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.738
If you win them, you win Monday.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.616
We should try.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.409
All right, fine. Let's do it.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.539
-[Mark] I'll set it up.
-Are we done here tonight?

17:19.622 --> 17:21.290
You still have a few calls.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.044
[Hannah] Mark, I was thinking,
maybe we could, um...

17:25.127 --> 17:28.172
cancel tomorrow night in Philadelphia.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.926
[Mark] We can't cancel any trip,
or any event. We shouldn't.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.680
A second to catch our breath
would be really helpful, I think.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.433
This is what it is, Hannah.
If you need to take a break, you can.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.769
Darling, we haven't slept all week.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.313
You're exhausted.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.532
-[Hannah] I... Just an idea.
-What's my next call?

18:09.005 --> 18:10.840
But you're not enjoying yourself.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.343
Because he won't listen to me.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.303
He can't win in the House.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.641
I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about you.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.062
What difference does it make
whether I'm enjoying myself or not?

18:25.146 --> 18:26.939
Isn't that what this is all about?

18:28.650 --> 18:32.945
Can't you just...
live in it for a second?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.781
You are in charge.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.866
-Yes, but--
-Come here.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.369
-Come.
-[sighs]

18:45.958 --> 18:47.919
You could wake up tomorrow...

18:49.003 --> 18:50.171
and...

18:51.380 --> 18:54.967
I don't know, feed the children...

18:55.051 --> 18:56.427
-[sighs]
-...start a war...

18:56.510 --> 18:58.262
You know what? I'm sorry.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.766
I shouldn't think out loud, that's all.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.436
No, you're right.

19:05.519 --> 19:09.065
Let's not talk about anything
that happens outside of this room.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.141
[door opening]

20:53.753 --> 20:55.462
[inhales deeply]

20:57.464 --> 20:58.465
[exhales]

21:23.866 --> 21:27.203
The sanctions are meant to target
the oligarch class in Russia.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.873
And the more members we have on board
before I sit down with President Petrov,

21:30.957 --> 21:33.042
the quicker this will resolve itself.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.339
We are. We are prepared to release
some of our strategic reserves

21:38.422 --> 21:39.631
to keep prices down.

21:39.715 --> 21:44.386
[sighs] Contact Ambassador Caspi
and buy me 15 more minutes.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.933
Uh, please don't think of this
as a deal with the Underwoods.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.519
To be frank,
they could be gone by Monday.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.815
That's not what I wish, of course.

21:55.898 --> 22:00.611
But know that you are working more
with me on this than with them.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.791
[indistinct chatter]

22:22.341 --> 22:23.759
Congressman Watts.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.137
Governor, we're so happy
you could join us today.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.098
As am I. The black community
deserves so much better

22:29.181 --> 22:30.849
than Frank Underwood's failed policies.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.685
That we can agree on. I look forward
to hearing about your platform.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.770
-Shall we?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

22:34.853 --> 22:38.149
We have just a bit more private
caucus business to attend to first.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.442
Excuse me? [chuckles lightly]

22:40.526 --> 22:42.403
This is a meeting
of the Congressional Black Caucus.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.322
Well, I understand.
That's... why we're here.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.784
I was told 9:00,
and it's already been an hour.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.911
You should have been told 10:00.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.122
And you will get your opportunity
to address us.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.875
-I appreciate your patience.
-[sighs]

23:01.964 --> 23:03.090
[door closes]

23:05.592 --> 23:07.303
I'm not gonna beg.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.555
No, you're gonna smile.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.145
The Muhammed Kalabi they arrested
in Tennessee

23:16.228 --> 23:17.939
is not the Kalabi connected to ICO.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.274
Can you prove it wasn't
just a bureaucratic mix-up?

23:20.357 --> 23:21.275
Uh, not yet.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.072
What else?

23:26.155 --> 23:29.616
Uh, final voter suppression lawsuit
was kicked back to the lower court,

23:29.700 --> 23:32.869
-SCOTUS deadlock is feeding the chaos.
-Do you read the paper, Sean?

23:33.537 --> 23:35.872
Billy got a byline on that three days ago.

23:37.874 --> 23:38.917
Declaration of war?

23:39.001 --> 23:41.587
Underwood was so evangelical,
but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.423
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.013
Lisa Williams.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.725
What about Lisa Williams?

23:55.726 --> 23:56.852
I saw you talking.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.730
I thought she might be a lead
worth pursuing.

23:59.813 --> 24:00.814
She's not.

24:00.897 --> 24:04.360
She's using what she read in the paper
to get attention or a little cash.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.402
I did some digging.

24:05.486 --> 24:09.198
She and Rachel Posner both went
to a church called the Fellowship.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.075
-Rachel disappeared--
-Stop.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.202
No more conspiracy theories
about dead girls.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.661
But people love stories about dead girls.

24:14.745 --> 24:19.000
The next House vote
is the day after tomorrow.

24:19.625 --> 24:24.880
The natives are restless, outraged,
just plain scared, actually.

24:24.963 --> 24:28.759
They want to wake up in the America
that they fell asleep in.

24:35.224 --> 24:40.062
Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead.
See if you can connect Underwood to it.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.120
So, this is the James S. Brady
press briefing room.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.375
And under our feet is
actually a swimming pool.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.294
It was built by the March of Dimes

25:03.377 --> 25:05.379
for President Franklin Roosevelt,
who had polio.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.799
And this pool was really
the only way for him to exercise.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.384
It was, uh, an open secret

25:10.467 --> 25:12.761
that the president used a wheelchair
most of the time.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.264
Which is why the White House

25:15.347 --> 25:19.226
was one of the first wheelchair-accessible
government buildings.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.895
-But everyone pretended he could walk?
-Yes.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.856
-That's a bit of grace.
-Yeah.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.817
A thing not spoken?

25:26.900 --> 25:30.404
Yeah, this building literally changed
because of his disability.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.949
But people just respected him,
respected his, uh--

25:34.032 --> 25:35.159
Right.

25:35.242 --> 25:39.621
[stutters] That office used to carry
so much weight, so much, uh, respect.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.582
You don't think it does anymore?

25:41.665 --> 25:45.502
No, oh, no, no!
I'm not saying that. [stutters]

25:45.586 --> 25:48.672
I was giving you a hard time.
I know what you meant.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.803
Anyway, sorry,
didn't mean to hijack the tour.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.058
Moving on... [chuckles]

26:08.066 --> 26:10.694
Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.369
I could come here today

26:18.452 --> 26:22.164
and talk about federal sentencing
disparities between crack and cocaine,

26:22.248 --> 26:26.210
-which obviously are racially motivated.
-I'm sorry, but are you asserting

26:26.293 --> 26:29.045
that the crack epidemic
is exclusive to the black community?

26:29.130 --> 26:30.881
No, not at all.

26:30.964 --> 26:34.551
But I think it's fair to say
that sentencing discrepancies

26:34.635 --> 26:37.929
have disproportionately
affected minority populations.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.931
We're not one-issue voters.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.767
Of course not. That's what I'm getting at.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.228
The whole point of today's meeting
is to broaden our platform.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.563
Republicans are always
dwelling on crime, Governor.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.274
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.526
We expected you
to come in here with a plan.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.027
And I do have a plan.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.531
Concentrating on a few pieces
of onerous legislation is not a plan.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.449
-Let's be clear...
-That kind of talk we've heard before.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.285
-I'm a Republican.
-Oh, here we go.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.702
[Conway] You're not listening.

27:00.786 --> 27:04.165
Look, I want to help you help yourselves.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.749
[all murmuring]

27:05.832 --> 27:07.376
[chuckles]

27:09.836 --> 27:11.213
[woman] Unbelievable.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.549
[Conway] That's my platform.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.927
Well... [inhales sharply]
I've heard enough.

27:20.055 --> 27:24.100
So, does anyone else have
any questions for the governor?

27:24.185 --> 27:26.144
[Conway] Well, I have a question.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.274
What has Francis Underwood
ever done for you?

27:32.734 --> 27:37.198
This little charade
this morning... [scoffs]

27:37.906 --> 27:40.742
-Well done. Quite an act.
-[sniffles] Will.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.244
-Governor.
-[Conway chuckles] No, but really.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.663
See, you may have differences with me...

27:45.997 --> 27:48.875
You may have genuine differences with me.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.628
But see, that's the operative word,
"genuine."

27:52.713 --> 27:54.465
Can someone here please explain to me

27:54.548 --> 27:57.718
why you all are still so loyal
to Francis Underwood and the Democrats?

28:02.013 --> 28:03.474
One of these days

28:03.557 --> 28:08.770
the members of this room will realize how
much you actually prop up the status quo.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.023
And how's that working for ya?

28:12.107 --> 28:15.694
Will, why don't we thank the gentlemen
and women for their time?

28:32.210 --> 28:33.712
You've made a mistake.

28:37.924 --> 28:41.512
What we're proposing is a new election
in the two states

28:41.595 --> 28:45.474
that weren't able to provide
valid electors by the safe harbor date.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.058
-Can we even do this?
-[all clamoring]

28:47.142 --> 28:49.102
Hold on. Hold on, everyone!

28:49.978 --> 28:53.148
I'd like to know, where does
the attorney general stand on this?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.191
[Claire] Looking into it, but on board.

28:55.276 --> 28:59.280
[Frank] Bob, there's no precedent here.
There's no playbook.

28:59.363 --> 29:03.700
We can look to the Constitution
for inspiration, but not for instruction.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.328
[Sadowsky] Thursday's vote showed
Democrats are coming to their senses.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.121
We lost one vote, Jordan.

29:08.204 --> 29:10.332
We can go back and forth
like this forever.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.502
As one of the few Republicans in the room,
it needs to be said.

29:13.585 --> 29:17.213
The stability of our country
is more important than the presidency.

29:17.298 --> 29:20.509
Not if people believe the president is
being chosen behind closed doors.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.845
A process that is laid out
in the Constitution.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.057
The same process that can keep us
gridlocked for the next two years.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.726
[Sadowsky] The House should
and will decide.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.895
Delaware has one congressman.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.691
How will that play in Austin
when your opponent in two years

29:35.774 --> 29:38.068
tells voters that you allowed
a state like Delaware

29:38.151 --> 29:39.903
to have the same influence as Texas?

29:40.737 --> 29:44.866
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger
of losing your seats.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.747
And there it is.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.083
Look. Look at them.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.212
That is the look of contemplating loss.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.006
Loss...

30:01.675 --> 30:06.179
the only constituent that
anyone in this room really listens to.

30:06.262 --> 30:09.099
I, for one, would like to hear how
the president feels about all this.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.726
-Well, I've made my--
-I think we could...

30:11.602 --> 30:14.771
[Sadowsky] No, Mr. President.
You haven't spoken much here.

30:14.855 --> 30:18.024
We believe in one person, one vote.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.986
If we take that away,
then what is this country?

30:22.654 --> 30:26.325
-Isn't that right, Mr. President?
-Absolutely, Madam President.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.329
[panting]

30:33.039 --> 30:35.626
Oh, wait, hold it.
Let me just move down a bit.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.836
I keep slipping off the podium.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.254
-Oh, you got me.
-That better?

30:39.338 --> 30:42.758
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...
-[both panting and grunting]

30:45.469 --> 30:47.721
So the Lincoln...

30:47.804 --> 30:50.599
-That was actually his office?
-Can we... can we not?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.809
-Can you... can you move me up a bit?
-Oh, yeah.

30:52.893 --> 30:55.562
-[chuckles]
-[grunts] Okay.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.564
[both panting and grunting]

31:07.699 --> 31:10.411
-How'd it go?
-We'll see.

31:10.494 --> 31:13.246
I need you to look over
the Antarctica statement again.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.706
Whatever you need.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.708
-Walk with me?
-Mmm.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.336
I'm worried about Francis.

31:21.254 --> 31:24.466
-Why?
-I might need you to save me.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.641
-This is not going to work.
-Why?

31:32.724 --> 31:34.810
If he loses, I still lose.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.937
He cannot be on the outside looking in.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.064
He'll win.

31:39.147 --> 31:43.234
-You actually believe that?
-Sure... why not?

31:45.028 --> 31:46.362
[Claire sighs]

31:47.823 --> 31:51.117
It was a wager.
The potential gains made it necessary.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.995
[Conway] It was a complete
waste of my time.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.789
If you don't start turning things around,

31:55.872 --> 31:58.500
you're going to be out
on your fucking ass. You understand?

32:00.251 --> 32:01.252
I do.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.552
I should explain something to you,
Governor.

32:11.805 --> 32:14.475
[chuckles] If you ever
talk to me like that again...

32:15.391 --> 32:18.437
I'll make sure you never win
another election in your life.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.734
-Are you threatening me?
-No, I'm enlightening you.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.537
[sighs]

32:41.251 --> 32:42.836
[sighs deeply]

33:29.925 --> 33:30.926
[knocks]

33:32.511 --> 33:35.263
-Hey.
-[co-pilot] Governor Conway. Hello, sir.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.766
How you doin'?
Take a peek,

33:37.849 --> 33:40.435
-if you don't mind, Captain?
-Governor.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.522
[Conway] I used to fly, too, you know.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.607
What kinda max thrust
you get on these engines?

33:45.691 --> 33:48.527
-Uh, about 6,400 pounds.
-6,400 pounds.

33:48.610 --> 33:51.279
I used to fly something a lot bigger,
a lot more power,

33:51.362 --> 33:54.324
but it was so weighed down
with all the weaponry,

33:54.407 --> 33:57.703
-it was like flying a tank.
-[all chuckle]

33:59.037 --> 34:00.080
Hey, um,

34:00.163 --> 34:03.124
why don't you let me in for a second,
just flip me the controls?

34:03.208 --> 34:04.459
I'm sorry, sir. I can't.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.879
Come on, I... I just want to
feel the weight on the stick for a second.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.965
I wish I could, but, uh,
you're not on the flight plan.

34:10.047 --> 34:13.927
You know I've been in situations,
where, like, I've been shot at.

34:14.010 --> 34:14.928
You realize that, right?

34:15.011 --> 34:18.639
You don't think I can handle a twin engine
at 35,000 feet,

34:18.724 --> 34:21.768
straight and level over some farm country?
I mean, come on, sir.

34:21.851 --> 34:22.893
-Sir.
-[Conway scoffs]

34:22.978 --> 34:25.146
[stutters] You should probably
go back to the main cabin.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.695
You know I'm gonna
be the president, right?

34:31.777 --> 34:34.322
-[captain] I hope so, sir.
-You hope so?

34:34.405 --> 34:38.159
-I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
-I'm gonna be the president,

34:38.243 --> 34:41.830
and you're going to flip me
those motherfucking controls.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.414
[Hannah] Will, come on.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.710
-What? What do you want?
-I just...

34:46.793 --> 34:49.630
[stutters] I need to talk to you
for a minute, please.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.346
I was just talking to the pilots.

34:58.429 --> 35:03.184
Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?
Breathe.

35:04.853 --> 35:08.439
-Will, why don't you sit down?
-Why don't you shut the fuck up?

35:08.523 --> 35:11.735
I'll fire you.
I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.236
[Hannah sighs]

35:13.319 --> 35:14.613
[Mark] Okay.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.451
What the fuck are you gonna do?

35:23.579 --> 35:26.833
Sit down and try and act like an adult...

35:27.500 --> 35:30.461
or at least like the next President
of the United States.

35:34.841 --> 35:35.842
Sit.

35:55.070 --> 35:59.115
[Doug] Who are they?
[LeAnn] Maybe Indonesian secret police?

36:00.659 --> 36:01.785
[Doug] What if we don't pay?

36:04.329 --> 36:05.747
Are there other buyers?

36:06.665 --> 36:07.874
I don't know.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.211
[Doug sighs]

36:13.296 --> 36:14.840
I'll take care of it.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.632
-How?
-Don't ask how.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.218
I'll get Macallan back.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.429
Obviously, this stays between us.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.517
Say, "Thank you, Doug."

36:28.269 --> 36:29.813
Thank you, Doug.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.403
We met on a bus.

36:37.487 --> 36:38.613
She was listening to music.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.907
And I asked her to go
to this church I used to go to.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.201
-Where was that?
-Maryland.

36:43.284 --> 36:47.663
The Winter's Run Fellowship.
About an hour north of Baltimore.

36:47.748 --> 36:48.999
So, then what?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.168
I don't know. We just...

36:52.252 --> 36:55.130
became friends.
And then it became more than that.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.758
Started spending every night together.

36:58.759 --> 37:02.053
At some point, she told me about this guy
who used to come around to check on her.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.890
-What'd he look like?
-I never saw him.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.768
Just sometimes she said he was coming,
so she couldn't hang out.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.519
She wouldn't really
tell me anything about him.

37:13.106 --> 37:14.107
[Sean] Everything okay?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.609
Yeah, do you mind?
I just need to see my friend up there.

37:24.826 --> 37:25.827
Hey.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.748
How are you doing?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.001
Thanks.

37:34.044 --> 37:37.923
You think there's oil there.
You're positioning to stake a claim.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.133
There are no Russian troops in Antarctica.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.260
[scoffs and chuckles]

37:42.343 --> 37:47.265
We're willing to recommend changes
to the Antarctic Treaty parties.

37:47.348 --> 37:51.352
What happens to you when
the Underwoods are ejected from office?

37:51.436 --> 37:55.440
You teach international relations
at a university?

37:55.523 --> 37:58.109
-Or work for a think tank?
-I haven't thought that far ahead.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.694
I think you have.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.905
How long do you expect
the world to believe

38:01.988 --> 38:06.367
-those aren't your soldiers?
-Do you like working for the Underwoods?

38:08.703 --> 38:10.246
How loyal are you?

38:12.457 --> 38:17.462
When the time comes,
will you stand with them... or not?

38:21.507 --> 38:22.926
I leave tomorrow.

38:23.634 --> 38:27.555
News of the sanctions will hit Monday.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.140
Let's meet before you go.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.022
You're a career diplomat, a professional.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.025
Maybe that's why I trust you.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.403
[Lisa] Then you take care of them,

38:42.487 --> 38:45.073
so they feel good
and they take care of you.

38:45.156 --> 38:49.119
So you feel good because...
I mean, Rachel was really beautiful.

38:49.202 --> 38:51.537
You could tell that
from across the street.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.957
I never saw her
from across the street, though.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.043
[chuckles]
Isn't that a funny thing to think about?

38:57.127 --> 38:59.004
[sighs] A lot of people, I think,

38:59.087 --> 39:02.340
they spot the one they love
from across the street sometimes.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.635
It's like they're running an errand,
and they happen to spot

39:05.718 --> 39:10.390
the one they love across the street
running a different errand.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.517
There's this sudden thrill, like...

39:13.476 --> 39:18.899
while the person you love
is inhabiting the same world as you.

39:18.982 --> 39:22.568
And they're just walking around,
buying, I don't know...

39:23.153 --> 39:27.532
Vitaminwater, and maybe they know that
you love them while they're doing it,

39:27.615 --> 39:31.619
and maybe it means
they're nice to a cashier.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.581
I never got to see her
from across the street, though.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.292
It just never happened.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.710
I don't want you to burn yourself.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.673
-[water running]
-[Lisa] No burning, no.

39:43.756 --> 39:44.840
[water stops]

39:45.926 --> 39:48.803
Rachel liked to smoke.
She said she was gonna stop,

39:48.887 --> 39:50.638
but she would have a rule
that she'd only smoke

39:50.721 --> 39:53.724
when we listened to
this one band we both loved.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.645
Because of the ceremony.

39:57.728 --> 39:58.813
[door opens]

39:59.855 --> 40:00.856
[door closes]

40:00.941 --> 40:05.028
"It should be a ceremony,"
it's what she said.

40:16.331 --> 40:20.335
Well, even if it's gum,
I still prefer to step outside to chew it.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.797
Like lighting a delicious cigarette.
[chuckles]

40:24.880 --> 40:27.342
The things we miss, the rituals...

40:29.677 --> 40:31.137
Excuse me.

40:32.638 --> 40:35.058
-She doesn't like me.
-She will.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.769
Thanks for coming out here
and meeting with him.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.939
You know you can't legally
remove Claire Underwood,

40:41.022 --> 40:43.149
-even if you win in the House?
-I'm working on that.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.484
I'm not interested.

40:46.736 --> 40:50.823
He needs you. I need you.
So does the country.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.908
I'm not a politician.

40:52.993 --> 40:56.662
I can give orders, I can follow orders
and I know when the hell to shut up.

40:56.746 --> 41:00.000
And you're a steady hand,
which, again, the country needs.

41:00.083 --> 41:03.628
-I'm not gonna be Conway's patsy.
-No, you're not.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.714
-He's a difficult man to be around.
-[sighs]

41:06.797 --> 41:09.968
It's over. It's over.
The process chose Claire Underwood.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.261
We'll get there.

41:13.888 --> 41:20.103
You'll be called vice president,
but you will be, de facto, something more.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.196
What were you doing there?

41:31.114 --> 41:34.492
I asked Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.745
Why the hell did you think
that was an appropriate thing to do?

41:37.828 --> 41:39.747
Didn't I tell you to drop this lead?

41:39.830 --> 41:41.707
Is it still a lead?
Because nobody's on it.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.044
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie,

41:44.127 --> 41:47.255
and everything she said to me
is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto,

41:47.338 --> 41:48.423
which has been picked apart

41:48.506 --> 41:51.592
by every message board
and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.970
At first, Grayson said
her name didn't ring a bell,

41:55.055 --> 41:56.472
but then he called me out of the blue

41:56.556 --> 41:59.392
and asked me if we were
still looking into it. So I followed up.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.357
You looked through my notes.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.324
You're out.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.993
-What?
-You're fired, Jeffries.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.913
It's a story. I was following it.

42:20.996 --> 42:24.167
I don't want you on my team.
Get out of my office.

42:42.685 --> 42:46.897
We know we can win both states.
Why would we not take this deal?

42:46.981 --> 42:48.316
[Hannah] No. The Underwoods want a revote

42:48.399 --> 42:50.860
because they know
they can't win in the House. We can.

42:50.943 --> 42:53.738
[Mark] We need to make a deal that forces
Claire Underwood to resign.

42:53.821 --> 42:56.532
-And why does that matter?
-[McCarthy over phone] <i>If I may?</i>

42:56.616 --> 42:58.451
-Madam Speaker.
<i>-Speaking from the Hill,</i>

42:58.534 --> 42:59.535
<i>as vice president,</i>

42:59.619 --> 43:01.912
<i>she'll have a public pulpit</i>
<i>to discredit your every move.</i>

43:01.996 --> 43:05.500
Oh, I'm going to exile Claire Underwood
to the Naval Observatory

43:05.583 --> 43:09.545
and stack her schedule
with state funerals in Southeast Asia.

43:09.629 --> 43:12.090
She'll never see the inside
of the West Wing, let alone the Oval.

43:12.173 --> 43:15.135
You need Brockhart by your side,
supporting you.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.678
I don't want to hear about Brockhart.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.972
[Hannah] What matters is that
Will becomes president.

43:20.055 --> 43:22.016
[Mark] Underwood in office
can cause damage.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.310
Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.

43:24.394 --> 43:28.689
I want this election to be
between me and Francis Underwood.

43:28.773 --> 43:30.024
Well, it isn't up to you.

43:30.108 --> 43:33.111
Speaker McCarthy isn't letting
this particular bill to the floor,

43:33.194 --> 43:36.114
unless we have an amendment attached
that removes Claire Underwood.

43:36.197 --> 43:37.240
Oh...

43:38.533 --> 43:39.742
[Mark] Will...

43:39.825 --> 43:43.413
Now, if you expect a willing partner
in the White House,

43:43.496 --> 43:46.332
you'd better let that bill get
to the floor as is.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.127
[Mark sighs]

43:50.336 --> 43:54.089
If you get to the Oval, Will, you're gonna
need the Speaker more than she needs you.

43:54.174 --> 43:59.011
So, I'm gonna call her back,
and you are going to apologize.

44:02.014 --> 44:03.015
[scoffs]

44:04.184 --> 44:05.185
Will.

44:06.977 --> 44:09.897
[sighs] Will, get back here!

44:11.607 --> 44:12.608
Will!

44:15.278 --> 44:16.279
[hangs up receiver]

44:17.530 --> 44:18.531
Enough.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.492
[knocking at door]

44:21.576 --> 44:22.868
[door opening]

44:22.952 --> 44:24.078
Shut the door.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.750
[door closes]

44:34.797 --> 44:36.299
You look like death.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.760
I can't get in touch with the kidnappers.

44:42.012 --> 44:44.849
It's been radio silence
for almost 24 hours.

44:49.312 --> 44:51.731
There's rumors they don't even
have him anymore.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.449
I can't keep this
from the president any longer.

45:05.661 --> 45:06.746
Okay.

45:07.747 --> 45:10.500
And then I'll tell him
what a big help you've been.

45:16.297 --> 45:18.799
Sanctions hit in a couple of hours.

45:18.883 --> 45:23.638
Deal with Secretary Durant
or with some very unhappy billionaires.

45:23.721 --> 45:27.933
[Petrov on phone] <i>You will allow me to</i>
<i>exploit whatever oil I find in Antarctica.</i>

45:28.017 --> 45:31.228
<i>And I'll tell you why.</i>
<i>I have something.</i>

45:31.812 --> 45:36.150
-Or rather, someone you need.
-[Claire] <i>What are you talking about?</i>

45:36.233 --> 45:37.818
Someone in your administration

45:37.902 --> 45:41.196
was willing to pay a great deal of money
for his safe return.

45:43.908 --> 45:48.078
Your Aidan Macallan.
He's here. In the Kremlin.

45:48.162 --> 45:51.374
<i>Who do you think orchestrated that leak?</i>

45:51.457 --> 45:53.543
<i>Seems to know quite a lot.</i>

45:53.626 --> 45:56.879
<i>Excuse me one moment.</i>
<i>The Secretary of State is here.</i>

45:56.962 --> 45:58.047
<i>Madam Secretary.</i>

45:58.130 --> 45:59.507
[Catherine] <i>Gentlemen.</i>

45:59.590 --> 46:03.010
[Petrov] <i>You must know Aidan?</i>
[Catherine] <i>I don't believe I do.</i>

46:07.264 --> 46:08.599
[Aidan] <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

46:09.850 --> 46:12.978
[Catherine] <i>You're American?</i>
[Aidan] <i>I am.</i>

46:13.062 --> 46:15.606
[Petrov] <i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>I'd just like you to know</i>

46:15.690 --> 46:20.528
that the president
and the former president are on the line.

46:21.446 --> 46:22.530
[Frank] <i>Cathy...</i>

46:22.613 --> 46:24.699
[Petrov] You can pick up the phone,
if you like.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.080
Mr. President.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.958
[Frank] <i>It's best you come back</i>
<i>to Washington.</i>

46:44.218 --> 46:45.345
[Mr. Barnes] Find anything yet?

46:46.637 --> 46:48.097
[sighs] Not yet.

46:49.014 --> 46:51.976
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes,
for letting me take a look.

46:52.893 --> 46:53.894
I won't be long.

46:54.729 --> 46:56.439
This is everything?

46:56.522 --> 46:58.524
This is everything
they sent from Zoe's apartment.

47:01.402 --> 47:02.695
I just, you know...

47:04.447 --> 47:06.449
I just can't seem to throw anything out.

47:10.953 --> 47:13.414
I mean, it's just papers, but...

47:18.085 --> 47:20.588
Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

47:20.671 --> 47:23.257
-Okay. Thank you.
-Yeah.

47:34.852 --> 47:35.853
[car door closes]

48:22.066 --> 48:23.275
Okay.

48:27.279 --> 48:29.406
The Black Caucus? Really?

48:29.490 --> 48:32.284
I like Mark,
because I always know where he stands.

48:32.367 --> 48:33.994
It's usually on someone's neck.

48:34.078 --> 48:35.580
What did you buy yourselves,
another day?

48:35.663 --> 48:37.582
[Frank] Enough time to talk
to David Rasmussen,

48:37.665 --> 48:39.459
who you clearly spoke to before.

48:39.542 --> 48:42.587
And to meet with Jordan Sadowsky
and the rest of the Republican leadership.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.922
[Mark] And what happens Tuesday?
Or Wednesday?

48:45.005 --> 48:49.301
Look, I... I can have David and the House
vote on this every single session.

48:49.384 --> 48:52.805
Our backgrounds are different, but we're
both hardscrabble boys at heart.

48:52.888 --> 48:56.058
We need the last word,
last blow, last move.

48:56.141 --> 48:57.810
We can push the bill through the House

48:57.893 --> 49:00.480
for a new election for president
in Tennessee and Ohio.

49:00.563 --> 49:02.147
[Mark] Speaker McCarthy
won't let that happen.

49:02.898 --> 49:06.360
But I could... convince her

49:06.443 --> 49:08.195
if you were to step down,

49:08.278 --> 49:10.573
and our full tickets
president and vice president

49:10.656 --> 49:12.992
run against each other
in Tennessee and Ohio.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.620
Well, to hell with that.
Well, to hell with that.

49:17.121 --> 49:20.958
We'll make the deal.
I think this is the right thing to do.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.544
Tomorrow, I'll announce my intention
to step down after the revote.

49:23.628 --> 49:26.672
[Mark] I'll let the Speaker know
to put the bill on the floor.

49:26.756 --> 49:28.841
We have one more outstanding
piece of business,

49:28.924 --> 49:30.635
the Supreme Court nominee.

49:30.718 --> 49:33.513
We'll need to appoint someone
to break the four-four deadlock.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.681
Approve Congress' new election date.

49:35.765 --> 49:39.852
-We, uh, have several people in mind.
-I want you to appoint Elizabeth Benson.

49:42.396 --> 49:44.439
Well, she's liberal enough
for you to swallow,

49:44.524 --> 49:46.358
and conservative enough when it counts.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.318
[Claire] We don't have time
for Senate hearings.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.112
[Mark] I can make a recess happen.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.918
I'll see you on the campaign trail.

50:09.381 --> 50:10.465
[door opens]

50:12.301 --> 50:13.678
[door closes]

50:13.761 --> 50:17.014
Where does that leave me, huh, Alex?

50:17.097 --> 50:19.391
I went out on a limb here.

50:19.474 --> 50:21.894
If we don't have
a vote in the House, then what?

50:21.977 --> 50:25.105
-Mark Usher is your friend, not mine.
-Mark Usher's no one's friend.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.776
Francis Underwood
hasn't won a thing, okay?

50:28.859 --> 50:31.320
And there's a good...
More than a good chance that Will Conway

50:31.403 --> 50:33.698
will be the next President
of the United States.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.620
[breathing heavily]

51:05.605 --> 51:07.064
[grunts]

51:07.147 --> 51:10.985
Could you give me a moment?
It's been a difficult few days.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.864
[groans]

51:14.947 --> 51:17.116
-[exhales deeply]
-Better?

51:17.199 --> 51:18.408
Yes.

51:20.327 --> 51:23.247
We couldn't let the House vote
proceed on Monday.

51:23.330 --> 51:24.373
Why not?

51:24.957 --> 51:26.751
Because you would've lost.

51:28.168 --> 51:32.172
Even if Conway took the presidency,
we would've had a foothold with you.

51:32.256 --> 51:35.009
We could've sabotaged,
just like we did with the Walkers.

51:35.092 --> 51:39.054
-The Conways are not the Walkers.
-It wasn't your decision to make.

51:40.055 --> 51:41.556
Excuse me?

51:41.641 --> 51:44.977
You said it yourself. You're only acting.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.945
I agreed with Usher

51:55.029 --> 51:58.907
because he will sacrifice everything
to get Brockhart into office,

51:58.991 --> 52:01.869
which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.829
I thought you saw what I saw.

52:04.872 --> 52:09.919
I did. I do.
We're perfectly in sync, Claire.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.096
