This is Air Unit 3. Forget it, Tango.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.419
We'll take it from here. Drop back.

00:45.962 --> 00:48.964
Drop dead. I've been on this case

Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.994
And good luck.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.454
Thanks. Over.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.714
- Jesus!
- Shit!

Shit!

What the hell's going on here?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.707
Just letting the locals do their thing.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.667
- You blew out the truck window.
- I noticed.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.086
- Two guys are in the road.
- I noticed.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.797
- We're out of our jurisdiction here.
- That's true.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.425
- What the hell's going on?
- I heard a rumor about this truck.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.677
- What about this truck?
- It's not a truck.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.804
- It's a gas truck.
- No.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.724
It's a major moving violation.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.187
- Did you check the first panel?
- It's full of gas, sir.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.440
We checked the whole truck, asshole!
There's nothing in it!

03:53.608 --> 03:56.193

04:05.995 --> 04:07.496

04:52.458 --> 04:56.753
I agree. I would like to handle
this myself, Mr. Perret.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.047
No, we will handle it.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.716
No.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.065
...on the spur of the moment. It's...

09:27.316 --> 09:29.150
What? Illogical?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.986
- Very!
- It's not that big a deal.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.821
I'll be gone a month or two.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.323
It takes that long to build a house,
not take a vacation.

09:35.575 --> 09:40.161

And besides, I just wanna get away.

You got everything you need
right here in this town.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.499

09:44.709 --> 09:46.585
No, thanks.
I'd really rather be out of here.

09:46.752 --> 09:50.672
Okay, then at least let me have
the phone numbers where I can reach you.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.550
Why don't I just call you?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.678
Why don't you just call me?

09:59.515 --> 10:00.515
Hmm.

10:02.518 --> 10:06.104
Catherine, if you're feeling stressed,
don't run away.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.523
Stay here and we can
deal with this together.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.191

10:10.359 --> 10:13.361

some time alone, okay?

10:13.779 --> 10:16.865
And I promise, lieutenant,
that I will be a good girl.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.908
There it is!

10:19.285 --> 10:20.869
The key word.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.579
"Good."

10:22.747 --> 10:27.125
You're telling me you'll be this good girl
because you know, don't you...

10:27.293 --> 10:29.919
...automatically, I think you'll be bad.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.256
- Yes?
- Hey, Ray, what's a margin call?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.425
- Why?
- Your stockbroker's on line 3.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.136
- Says it's urgent.
- This is very important. Don't leave.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.846
Yeah?

10:42.016 --> 10:43.266
Hold on. Catherine.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.420

11:16.467 --> 11:18.343
Oh, boy.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.178
Look at this, will you?

11:20.763 --> 11:24.307
This shirt cost me 9 bucks.
Get me a new vest, will you?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa, pizza!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.948
Who's been fucking with my gun?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.242
The sight's shifted on it.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.953
- Maybe you dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.456
- Hey, captain!
HOLMES: Yeah, Gabe.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.250
CASH:
You get anything out of that guy?

11:50.418 --> 11:54.713
Nothing, he doesn't speak any English.
Our interpreter says he wants a lawyer.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.798
- Let me question him.
- Question him?

11:56.966 --> 12:00.593
The guy that just tried
to blow you away? Forget it!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.805
Stay away from him, Gabe.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.858
CASH:
Hi.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.862
So you don't know any English, huh?

12:19.029 --> 12:23.158
I don't know much Chinese, so we'll
have to give you a crash course, buddy.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.245
But I got a feeling you're gonna be
a real quick learner.

12:27.413 --> 12:31.124
Yeah, come here. Sit down.
There we go.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.627
All right, this is lesson number one.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.713
And the next lessons do get harder.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.506
Who hired you to kill me?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.675
I don't know!

12:40.843 --> 12:42.510
"I don't know."

12:43.679 --> 12:46.347
Nope, wrong answer. Try again.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.268
I think he's one of Quan's men.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.354
I don't know his name. I swear!

12:54.231 --> 12:55.690
Look at that, Flattop.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.526
You're speaking like a native already.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.070
OFFICER: What is this?
- English 101.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.075
Since your scumbag lawyer
won't be here for quite some time...

13:06.243 --> 13:08.036
...is there anything else
you wanna share?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.163
Think hard.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.249
A deal. Tonight.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.543
4942...

13:15.711 --> 13:17.545
...Front Street. 9:00.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.047
Very good.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.550
My compliments.

13:22.927 --> 13:27.096
Pretty good for your first lesson.
Don't forget to wash your hands.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.225
SCHROEDER:
Ray? Your ship's come in.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.894
There's a big bust going down
at 4942 Front Street.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.563
- Great. Is that reliable?
- Very reliable. A phone tap.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.024
- Fantastic.
- What the hell is this?

13:38.192 --> 13:40.902
Downtown clown
versus Beverly Hills wop.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.531
- All the news that's fit to print.
- I don't understand you.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.243
You make a shitload of money.
What are you doing this for?

13:48.410 --> 13:49.786
- Action.
- Action?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.246
Good old American action.

13:51.497 --> 13:55.124
If you want to stare death in the eye,
you should've gotten married.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.793
Is that a proposal?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.996
PERRET:
Gabriel Cash.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.706
Oh, God.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.958
How many millions? How many?

14:37.251 --> 14:38.877
How many this time?

14:53.142 --> 14:54.851
PERRET:
Oh, God!

14:55.519 --> 14:57.228
Ray Tango!

14:57.396 --> 14:59.188
How he loves to dance.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.483
He waltzes in and takes all my drugs...

15:02.693 --> 15:05.653
...and then Tangos back out again.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.156
I've had enough of this.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.742
Too much television...

15:13.162 --> 15:14.829
...can hurt your eyes.

15:16.665 --> 15:20.960
Now... Now do you understand
why we mustn't kill them?

15:21.128 --> 15:23.713
No, Mr. Perret. I do not understand.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.840
It would be much quicker.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.342
And easier.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.262
Quicker...

15:32.014 --> 15:33.389
...and easier.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.559
Yes, quick and easy
is how you make a cake.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.395
Or clean a toilet bowl, or shop...

15:39.605 --> 15:41.022
...by mail.

15:41.857 --> 15:46.361
But quick and easy is not how you run
a multimillion-dollar business such as ours.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.363
Now, Mr. Quan.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.032
On the east side...

15:51.200 --> 15:54.369
That's your part of the city.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.829
- Gabriel Cash...

15:57.706 --> 15:59.916
...has cost me more than $60 million...

16:00.209 --> 16:04.045
...including guns, drugs
and various other enterprises.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.880
On the west side...

16:06.048 --> 16:07.590
...Mr. Lopez...

16:09.551 --> 16:11.219
...Ray Tango...

16:11.887 --> 16:13.888
...has cost me even more.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.142
Two little mice...

16:18.560 --> 16:20.228
...and so much damage.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.983
But...

16:26.902 --> 16:30.905
...if we kill them,
we risk all-out war with the police.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.658
They're heroes already.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.618
Why make martyrs of them?

16:36.870 --> 16:38.955
Instead of death...

16:40.290 --> 16:42.083
...we have a game.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.752
A game that only we can win.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.714
Within two weeks...

16:49.091 --> 16:54.429
...I will be taking delivery
of the largest shipment of weapons...

16:54.596 --> 16:56.264
...that we have ever handled.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.267
Within that time...

17:03.439 --> 17:05.064
...Tango...

17:05.441 --> 17:06.523
...and Cash...

17:08.109 --> 17:11.404
...will be safely tucked away...

17:14.782 --> 17:17.660
...behind bars.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.610
I'd say it's the other way around.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.613
I pull this trigger,
your throat's hanging off that wall.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.616
You pull that trigger,
I'll blow you in half.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.493
You never had a chance
to hit me with that gun.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.287
Not with this one. This one.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.336
- You know me, huh?
- I hear you're the second-best cop in L.A.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.129
I heard the same thing about you.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.465
- Stay off my case.
- What makes it your case?

20:17.633 --> 20:19.217
I've been on it for three months.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.721
Then you're stupid. I've been on it for half
an hour now and I'm all caught up with you.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.807
- Stay off my case.
- Nice tie.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.813
It's your bust.
How do you wanna do this?

20:32.981 --> 20:35.483
- I'll go first. Cover me on three.
- Okay.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.026
One.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.820
- Two.
- Three.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.323
Freak!

20:42.491 --> 20:43.991
What's the score, babe?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.748
My turn. Don't move!

20:51.833 --> 20:53.334
Don't move your hands.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.672
CASH: I don't think his hands
are going anywhere.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.009
Wanna do the honors?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.308
He's wired.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.312
No, no, no. This is all wrong!

21:13.855 --> 21:16.524
TANGO: You ought to be a cop.
CASH: Did you expect this?

21:16.733 --> 21:20.444
No, I didn't this,
and I didn't expect you, either.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.698
Why the hell is he wired?

21:23.865 --> 21:28.160
CASH /OVER SPEAKER/: I don't know, but
you'll play hell getting anything out of him.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.079
I'm gone. Ciao, babe.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.330
/GLASS BREAKS/

21:33.542 --> 21:34.875
Drop your weapons!

21:35.085 --> 21:36.877
- Freeze!
- We're cops!

21:37.045 --> 21:41.716
Wait a minute! We're on the same team!
Just read this, goddamn it!

21:41.883 --> 21:44.719
I'm gonna blow
both your fucking brains out!

21:45.887 --> 21:47.596
- No problem.
- I'm convinced.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.056
The man's hysterical.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.225
- I'd like a receipt for that.
- Yeah, me too.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.894
We can talk about this.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.029
Christ, that's my gun.

22:04.406 --> 22:07.491
- What's your gun doing here?
- That's my gun, I put it in my locker.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.744
WYLER:
It's not your gun now!

22:11.705 --> 22:12.997
It's evidence.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.499
TANGO: Why's your gun here?
CASH: They stole it.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.293
Tell me what you did.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.756
I don't know this man.
I didn't come with him.

22:22.007 --> 22:25.843
And with your permission,
I'll be leaving. Ciao.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.929
You may not have arrived with him,
but you're leaving with him.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.431
You're making a mistake.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.933
You're going down for this.

22:34.269 --> 22:38.689
Get these bastards out of here! Now!

22:38.857 --> 22:42.193
- You're bad karma.
- I hope you got a good lawyer.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.798
Perret says use this tape here.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.433
- Is it true Tango shot a federal officer?
- No comment.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.061
/ALL CLAMORING/

23:17.270 --> 23:20.147
- Was Detective Cash there too?
- No comment.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.192
SCHROEDER:
What do they have?

23:23.568 --> 23:26.195
They got a.380
with Cash's fingerprints.

23:26.488 --> 23:30.074
They think it's the murder weapon.
Ballistics is checking it.

23:30.409 --> 23:35.329
They were found at the scene of the crime.
Nobody else was seen coming or going.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.458
What else?

23:39.918 --> 23:41.210
Sir, tape is ready.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.504
What tape?

23:47.509 --> 23:50.803
TANGO: Show us the money.
AGENT: It's in the suitcase.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.346
CASH: Open it.
AGENT: It's all there.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.515
- Count it if you want to.
TANGO: We want to.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.975
AGENT:
Okay, where's the stuff?

23:56.226 --> 23:59.437
CASH: Right here. Best high for the buy.
Direct from the department lockup.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.523
AGENT: You know, I like dealing with cops.
TANGO: Why's that?

24:02.691 --> 24:05.526
AGENT: It restores my low opinion
of human nature.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.446
CASH:
Really? In that case, you'll love this.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.655
/GUNSHOT ON TAPE/

24:11.199 --> 24:13.367
NEWSCASTER 1
Lieutenants Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash...

24:13.535 --> 24:16.829
...two highly decorated officers,
go on trial today...

24:16.997 --> 24:20.374
...for slaying an undercover agent
during a drug-sting operation.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.418
NEWSCASTER 2:
Officers Tango and Cash insist...

24:22.711 --> 24:26.046
...they are victims of a setup,
possibly a retaliation by criminal figures...

24:26.214 --> 24:28.549
...aimed at taking the two top cops
out of action.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.886
NEWSCASTER 1: Expert witnesses
will lead off the prosecution s case.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.054
PROSECUTOR:
Mr. Skinner, you've heard the tapes.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.558
If you had to make a judgment
regarding its authenticity...?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.561
There's no reason for me to believe
it isn't genuine.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.855
NOLAN:
How did you test this tape?

24:43.064 --> 24:45.191
SKINNER:
I took samples of the suspects' voices...

24:45.358 --> 24:49.069
...and compared them to the tape
with an oscilloscope. They matched.

24:49.237 --> 24:53.240
When this is over, remind me
to rip Jumbo there's tongue out.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.242
With a tow truck.

24:56.912 --> 25:00.664
When I entered the premises,
I saw the two suspects, the guns...

25:00.999 --> 25:04.793
...the money, the drugs, the dead body.
That's what I saw.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.420
When these two guys show up...

25:06.630 --> 25:09.256
...I figure the whole thing's gone sour.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.926
So I'm gonna go in
and clear everything up...

25:13.136 --> 25:14.178
...when they kill him.

25:14.346 --> 25:18.098
When this is over, we have to pay
Jabba the Hutt here a visit.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.975
I'll bring the chain saw.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.602
I'll bring the beer.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.355
/SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE/

25:24.523 --> 25:26.148
Detective Cash assaulted me.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.651
He put a chair on my chest and sat on it.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.402
I couldn't find a piano.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.947
/SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE/

25:33.281 --> 25:35.908
The son of a bitch can speak English!

25:36.117 --> 25:37.451
The squarecrow can talk!

25:37.619 --> 25:39.787
- Squarecrow?
- What would you call it?

25:39.955 --> 25:42.957
NEWSCASTER 1: As the attorneys
for Tango and Cash left the courtroom...

25:43.208 --> 25:45.501
...their mood can only
be described as grim.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.336
They clearly face an uphill battle...

25:47.629 --> 25:49.547
...if not an impossible one.

25:52.842 --> 25:57.179
Ray, somebody set you up good.
I feel we should cop a plea.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.974
You can guarantee me minimum security?

26:00.183 --> 26:03.018
Absolutely. No question.
That'll be the deal.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.312
Is Cash's attorney
giving him the same advice?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.356
If he's smart, he is.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.359
I want to talk to Cash.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.995
I need to work on my
statement for the court.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.204
Why do you wanna see me?

26:22.372 --> 26:25.207
First of all, I wanna say
I'm not fond of your kind.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.959
Oh, really, what kind is that?

26:27.210 --> 26:29.587
You're a glory hound and a hot dog.

26:29.754 --> 26:30.838
CASH:
That stings.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.340
Let me know when the critique is over.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.758
It's over.

26:35.385 --> 26:38.053
- My lawyer wants me to cop a plea.
- Mine too. Eighteen months.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.097
Lompoc Federal Country Club.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.851
I understand they open the gym at 5 a.m.
You can start pumping early.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.236
- Who do you think set us up?
- I don't know.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.863
I got a lot of admirers. You?

26:56.573 --> 26:57.990
I got a few.

26:58.575 --> 27:03.203
Look, if we cop a plea,
we cop it together.

27:03.371 --> 27:07.875
I think what you're saying is your lawyer
wanted you to consider making a deal...

27:08.043 --> 27:11.670
...but you didn't want to leave
this glory hound holding the bag.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.839
Sound about right, Ray?

27:14.007 --> 27:15.591
- About.
- Very generous guy.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.593
- I'll make the statement.
- I will.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.094
- No way.
- Why not?

27:19.262 --> 27:20.929
- You'll screw it up.
- When's your birthday?

27:21.097 --> 27:22.640
- Why?
- When were you born?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.308
- Why?
- Day and month.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.810
- You want to do my horoscope?
- Don't give me the year.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.646
When were you born?

27:28.897 --> 27:31.231
- May.
- February. Ha-ha-ha!

27:31.399 --> 27:34.109
I got seniority.
I'll make the statement.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.236
August 16.

27:37.072 --> 27:42.076
I read your records. Isn't that the date
you were hatched? August 16th ring a bell?

27:42.243 --> 27:44.036
I got seniority.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.579
Heh-heh-heh!

27:45.747 --> 27:47.414
BAILIFF:
All rise.

Be seated.

to change their plea.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.474
JUDGE:
Order!

28:07.310 --> 28:09.853
Very well, counselor.
What is the plea?

28:10.271 --> 28:12.648
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?

28:13.316 --> 28:15.067
Proceed, Mr. Tango.

28:17.570 --> 28:18.654
It's okay.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.829
Your Honor, I've been
a policeman for 12 years.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.082
I think it's the best organization
in the country.

28:30.875 --> 28:35.212
I've been accused of being too aggressive
in taking criminals off the street.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.797
Well, if that's a sin...

28:37.132 --> 28:38.924
...then I guess I'm guilty.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.885
All the cops I've worked with
are good cops.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.929
You are.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.681
Doing a tough job.

28:46.516 --> 28:50.853
I only hope that the outcome of this trial
is such that the whole department...

28:51.604 --> 28:55.858
...is not judged
by what has transpired here.

Do you have anything to add, Mr. Cash?

29:10.832 --> 29:12.750
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- No! No, no.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.877
- Yeah.
- No.

29:17.547 --> 29:21.300
Mr. Tango has spoken very eloquently.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.678
And I wish I could be as forgiving.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.431
But I can't, because...

29:29.851 --> 29:31.059
...this whole thing...

29:33.021 --> 29:34.021
...fucking sucks!

29:34.355 --> 29:36.398
This is the biggest pile of shit!

29:52.707 --> 29:55.959
NOLAN: Your Honor, the defendants
wish to plead no contest...

29:56.211 --> 29:58.545
...to a charge of
voluntary manslaughter.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.798
I take it this is part of an agreement?

30:01.216 --> 30:03.675
PROSECUTOR:
Yes. The state recommends a sentence...

30:03.968 --> 30:08.055
...of not more than 18 months
in a minimum-security facility.

30:09.766 --> 30:14.102
Mr. Cash, Mr. Tango, do you
enter this plea of your own free will?

30:15.063 --> 30:17.147
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.817
JUDGE: The agreement is
acceptable to the court.

30:20.193 --> 30:24.071
The defense and the state
will deliver the proper documentation.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.698
Court is adjourned.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.914
PERRET: Now that Tango and Cash
are behind bars...

30:34.249 --> 30:37.167
...you don't have to be afraid anymore.

30:38.586 --> 30:42.256
What's the matter, gentlemen?
You don't share my enthusiasm.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.091
Mr. Perret, I am sorry...

30:44.259 --> 30:48.428
...but I cannot appreciate
these games you keep playing.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.806
QUAN:
Forgive me for asking, Mr. Perret...

30:50.974 --> 30:54.351
...but what happens in 18 months
when they get out?

30:56.020 --> 30:58.021
Use your imagination.

31:00.733 --> 31:04.611
What makes you think
they'll ever get out again?

31:06.364 --> 31:09.157
Now go take care of your business.

31:09.450 --> 31:12.744
I got a feeling this is
gonna be a great year.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.901
I don't think there's
a golf course here.

Make yourselves
at home sweet home, boys.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.116
CASH: This has gotta be a mistake.
What do you think?

31:51.284 --> 31:55.037
TANGO: I think my underwear
is riding into my throat. Ow!

31:56.080 --> 31:58.665
They're not there?
They were on that bus!

31:58.833 --> 32:01.001
I'm already trying to trace them.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.922
They were transferred
off the bus near Victorville.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.214
We gotta find them.

everybody else in this deal.

Oh, man.

32:23.274 --> 32:27.361
I'll tell you one thing.
Whoever set us up is fucking connected.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.738
Who do you think it is, Quan?

32:30.031 --> 32:31.365
Thanks.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.327
No, wait! I got it!

32:35.495 --> 32:37.120
It's Lopez!

32:37.288 --> 32:39.539
It's Lopez! Follow me through here.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.876
Lopez has a guy pretend
to try and kill me...

32:43.044 --> 32:45.045
...and claims that Quan put him up to it.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.256
That Chinese guy feeds me
bogus information about the setup.

32:48.424 --> 32:52.386
That way Lopez figures, no matter
what happens, I'll think it was Quan.

32:52.553 --> 32:56.223
All the time it's Lopez,
and now I know it, right?

32:56.849 --> 32:58.392
Well, what do you think?

32:58.977 --> 33:02.312
I think with your IQ,

too interested in counting calories.

Could it be you're too busy counting
the money they paid you to set us up?

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.620
I didn't set you up.

You're looking terribly anemic.

I think what you need
is a little... iron in your diet.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.055
I know you switched those weapons...

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:45.807
...and planted the murder weapon
at the scene, didn't you?

01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:47.851
- They paid me.
- Who paid you?

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.896
- I don't know.
- You FBI guys are real brainy.

- An Englishman with red hair.

He just has a funny way of showing it.

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:03.156
You guys see a lot of each other?

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.325
He comes and goes as he pleases.

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.035
That's a little insensitive.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.954
But I live my own life.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:11.873
Good for you.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:14.834
Lower.

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:26.221
CASH: Kiki?
CATHERINE: Yeah?

01:10:26.972 --> 01:10:28.306
/CASH MOANING/

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:31.601
- Lower?
CASH: Yeah.

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.019
Harder.

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:35.480
CATHERINE:
I'll just move it around real slow.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.403
CASH: Don't stop.
CATHERINE: I can do this all night.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:44.489
CASH:
God, prove it.

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:46.658
Faster.

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:48.576
CATHERINE:
More?

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:50.536
CASH: Deeper.
- Oh, my God, Gabe!

01:10:50.704 --> 01:10:53.081
- I can feel it going in!
CASH: Oh! Harder!

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.667
- It's almost in!
CASH: God! It's all the way in!

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.754
TANGO:
Heads up, sleazebag!

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.509
SCHROEDER:
Ray?

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.804
- Captain?
- This the way you screen all your guests?

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.347
I'm sorry, captain.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.933
Freeze! Drop the duck!

01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:14.018
Tango?

01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:18.314
Real great police work!
Way to go, Cash! Way to stay on top of it!

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.441
- What were you doing?
CASH: Nice to see you too.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.443
You almost nailed your captain.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:24.862
At least I saw him!
What were you doing in there?

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:27.156
I was getting ready to make my move.

01:11:27.491 --> 01:11:30.034
- By the way, your girlfriend...
- My sister!

01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:31.494
- My what?
- Your what?

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:34.497
- My sister.
- She's your...?

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.542
That's great! I don't mean that.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.752
Look, I know it had to look bad.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:43.464
I never deliberately
punched out anyone in my life.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.883
But you I'm gonna hammer
right through the lawn.

01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:48.052
- Oh, really?
CATHERINE: Who do you think you are?

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.597
Don't you know how to use a doorbell?
Just stick out your finger and push.

01:11:51.765 --> 01:11:54.892
- Isn't this 125 Orange Grove Street?
CATHERINE: Yeah, it is.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:58.229
This is my place. I have some rights
under my own place, don't I?

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:03.109
No, Catherine. It's my roof, my house,
and I let you dwell here.

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:04.402
I pay you rent!

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.196
- You're two weeks late.
- If you would check your mail...

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:10.158
Well, in Tango's defense,
he has been in prison.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.664
Excuse me, my pantyhose
are riding into the unknown.

01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:18.499
Way up in the unknown.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:21.002
Just answer me one thing, seriously.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:24.589
What were you doing on the couch
with Queen-for-a-Day?

01:12:27.092 --> 01:12:28.926
It's none of your business.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:30.345
Catherine...

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:34.515
She got the brains and the looks.
How do you figure it?

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.100
I don't.

01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:38.144
- Smoke?
- No.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.229
TANGO:
To protect against guys like him!

01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:43.232
All right. All right, that's it!

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.318
You're not gonna run us in, are you?

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:49.280
No, but I can only keep the department
off your backs for 24 hours.

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.199
The feds are on the case!

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.869
I suggest you slip into something
a little more butch.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.039
You get rid of Daffy Duck there
and try to clear your names.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.624
Already started.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:01.584
What do you got?

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:04.462
This tape will clear our names.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.464
Compliments of Jumbo the forger.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:07.757
Skinner?

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:10.343
Yeah. So, what have you got?

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:11.886
About quarter to four.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.890
Look, start with this.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.893
We ID'd that creep from the warehouse.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:22.271
- Ponytail?
- Yeah. His name's Requin.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.982
Look him up.
The address is right there.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:28.444
You got 24 hours to find the guy
who set you up.

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:31.155
CASH: When's the clock start?
- Five minutes ago.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.157
Catherine.

01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:34.659
Honestly...

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.162
...what were you doing
with the Elephant Man?

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:43.167
Please.

01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:46.295
Come in the house. Change your clothes.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:50.007
You'll make a very ugly bride someday.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.843
CASH:
Is that a proposal?

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:01.018
- Blue one's nice.
TANGO: Blue it is.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.771
Sorry about my behavior tonight.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.149
I just want you to be okay.

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.775
I'm okay.

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:11.696
I can't believe all that's happened.
How did you get out of prison?

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:14.991
Cash. He had a friend on the inside.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.994
I didn't wanna come here,
but I had no other place to go.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.872
You're my brother.
Where else are you supposed to go?

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:23.958
- The North Pole would be nice.
- Seriously, what are you gonna do?

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:26.836
Maybe you'd be better off
turning yourself in.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:28.796
- And talking to the press.
- No.

01:14:31.508 --> 01:14:34.886
- How's the career going at the club?
- That's great!

01:14:35.053 --> 01:14:38.556
You're being hunted
and you're worried about my dancing?

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:40.558
I'm not worried about anything.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:45.021
If you needed a little extra cash,
I could buy you a bond or something.

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:47.690
It's a seven-and-a-quarter yield.

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:49.025
Big money.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:53.863
- You help me out more than you need to.
- No, I don't.

01:14:54.072 --> 01:14:57.158
I spend so much time with my career,
I hardly get a chance to see you.

01:14:57.409 --> 01:15:00.661
You have nothing to feel guilty about.
I love you.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.082
Put her there.

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:08.044
Push them back, way back!

01:15:10.088 --> 01:15:12.256
I gotta go.
I don't wanna put you in jeopardy.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:16.260
- What are you talking about?
- All that filth and scum I have to deal with.

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:18.429
- Here I am!
- See?

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.723
Clock's running, Ray. Let's go.

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:22.725
See you later.

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:24.936
- Mind if I have a word with Kiki?
- No.

01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:27.396
I just wanted to say
I was having a wonderful time...

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:31.067
...until Captain Fantastic leaped the couch
and smashed through your door.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:36.280
Anyway, when this is straightened out,
could we get together again?

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:38.407
Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice.

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:40.618
Maybe we can go down to the ballpark...

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.370
Can I talk to you?

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:46.207
Cash, I don't think my sister is your type.

01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:42.096
Easy, mate.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:44.807
Come on.

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:51.022
Been expecting you.

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:56.569
Shame, shame. Ponytails are out
this season. How you doing, Cash?

01:16:57.237 --> 01:16:59.780
Things are getting better by the second.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.700
- There's a party on the roof.
- Can I invite Mr. Potato Head?

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:05.494
Sure. Wouldn't be a party
without Potato Head.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:08.456
REQUIN: No!
CASH: Plan A.

01:17:08.665 --> 01:17:09.999
TANGO:
This party's really fun!

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:13.461
Thanks. How about it, Requin?
Hell of a view, huh?

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.713
Come on, meat puppet!
Who pulls your strings?

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:18.883
Piss off! Bollocks to plan A!

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:21.969
I like this. The view's great up here!

01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:25.389
- What'd he say?
- Plan A's a loser.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:30.394
Hold on. Give me a name, Death Breath,
or you're going back to England in a baggie!

01:17:30.687 --> 01:17:33.898
Up yours, asshole!
You ain't worth a toss.

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.358
Go on, drop me.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:36.817
Do it!

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.235
Plan A is definitely a loser.

01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:41.238
- Bigtime. Let's go to plan B.
- You got a plan B?

01:17:41.406 --> 01:17:42.823
Hiroshima. Ring a bell?

01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:44.492
CASH:
This is plan B?

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.202
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.412
Not now, I'm busy.

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.416
Just a second. Please.

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:56.003
- Seriously, you're getting a little radical.
- What's radical?

01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:59.757
Blowing a man's head off with
a fucking hand grenade is a touch much.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.717
You got your way, I got mine.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.387
I'm kind of glad you didn't want to talk.

01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:06.931
Let me just shoot him in the leg.
He'll talk.

01:18:07.307 --> 01:18:08.933
I want the whole package!

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.601
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.687
- I don't really care!
- What do you mean?

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.105
What the fuck? You're a cop!

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:18.275
I was a cop! But because of this dirtbag
and his friends, we're on the run!

01:18:18.735 --> 01:18:19.985
No. It's payback!

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:21.445
That's enough! I mean it!

01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:24.615
- Is it?
- Oh, man, I heard about you.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:27.284
- Did you?
- I heard you were a Section 8.

01:18:27.452 --> 01:18:30.454
I didn't believe that sadistic bullshit
I heard you pulled...

01:18:30.622 --> 01:18:32.164
...but you're for real!

01:18:32.499 --> 01:18:36.001
If you don't want to get sticky,
get back...

01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:37.253
...Jack.

01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:38.462
/HUMS/

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.506
You got it, sicko.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:45.970
You blew it, pal. This asshole's
out of control and I can't stop him.

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:48.180
I'm not going down for this.

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:50.725
- I'm out of here!
- Don't forget to write!

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:54.395
You want my vote for the Psycho
Hall of Fame, asshole? You got it!

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:58.190
You really do look like shit
in a ponytail.

01:18:58.358 --> 01:18:59.400
/MUFFLED GRUNTING/

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.777
TANGO:
No. I'm sorry.

01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:04.029
Bye-bye, birdy. Bye, baby!

01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:06.198
I don't wanna hear it.

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:09.618
Perret! The geezer you want
is Yves Perret!

01:19:09.786 --> 01:19:10.995
CASH:
Who the hell is Perret?

01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:12.913
The bloke with me in prison.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:15.541
- Where's he now?
- The desert. Ryko Aifrield.

01:19:15.792 --> 01:19:17.001
Think he's telling the truth?

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:19.003
It's not raining
and he's standing in a puddle.

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:20.337
Disgusting.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:24.175
You just fell for the oldest routine
in the book. Bad cop...

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:25.342
Worse cop!

01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:30.514
- Did you sleep with my sister?
- I don't believe you!

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:32.933
- Did you two bump uglies with my sister?
- "Bump uglies."

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:36.228
- Did you?
- I was so drunk, I don't remember.

01:19:36.521 --> 01:19:38.189
Come on, worse cop, we're late.

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:43.444
My little contribution to birth control.

Bloody dud.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:56.040
TANGO: What about my sister?
CASH: It's a free country.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.292
TANGO: What's that mean?
CASH: People are free.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.045
TANGO: So?
CASH: So your sister is very free.

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:02.713

Okay, Owen, let's have it.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:24.235
Transfer case has torque splitting.

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:28.906
It'll see 60 in five and a half seconds
and pull high-tens in the quarter.

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:30.616

Owen, gone! Home run!

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:53.931
Do you know what kind of firepower
we're talking about here?

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:57.476
This is a violent work of art!

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.436

Hey, Owen has milliseconds of genius,
believe me.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.072
What's this one do?

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:13.033

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:14.827
Uh-huh. And what's that mean?

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:16.787
What's the difference? We'll take it.

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:20.875
No, you can't take that.
It's one of a kind, a prototype.

Owen, trust us.
We won't put a scratch on it.

There's been a lot of construction...

...I am gonna date your sister.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.407
Look, Cash, I got nothing against you.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:23.497
But I don't want Catherine getting
that 2-in-the-morning phone call...

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.666
...saying something's happened to you.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.086
If she has to live with that,
it would kill me.

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:32.631
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
I'm charmed.

01:23:35.927 --> 01:23:39.263
I'll tell you what. I'll stay away...

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:43.267

Fair enough?

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:45.394

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:14.410
Oh, yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just worried about you.

01:37:14.578 --> 01:37:17.705
CASH: Thanks. I'll probably lose my arm
on account of saving him.

01:37:17.873 --> 01:37:19.916
Catherine, come on, it's a scratch.

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:22.669
Cash, you got sloppy and stumbled.

01:37:22.878 --> 01:37:25.755
Sloppy? I took that hit for you!

01:37:25.923 --> 01:37:29.133
After all I've done for you,
you're still ungrateful.

01:37:29.385 --> 01:37:30.927
- Done for me?
CASH: Yeah.

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:32.679
Guys, this is no time to argue.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.431
He just can't accept
that he's the number two cop.

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:37.642
It's very hard for him to handle.

01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:41.521
Dream on.
You got your version, I got the truth.

01:37:41.897 --> 01:37:45.441
Why don't you just admit it,
that you guys work well together.

01:37:46.068 --> 01:37:48.403
No matter what you say, Ray...

01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:51.990
...l've at least earned the right
to date your sister.

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:57.203
- Over my dead body.
- Deal?

01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:41.756
