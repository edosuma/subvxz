- Man: Hey.
- Man #2: What's going on?

00:21.440 --> 00:23.954
Man: He's definitely in there.
He ain't openin' the door.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.190
- Man #2: You hopped up?
- Man: Absolutely.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.233
- (knocks on door)
- Man #2: Harrold?

00:31.120 --> 00:34.157
- (pounding on door)
- Harrold!

00:34.240 --> 00:36.356
Hey, buddy, I wanna talk to you!
Open the door!

00:36.440 --> 00:38.431
(rustling)

00:39.360 --> 00:40.918
I hear him in there.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.350
Harrold!
Take your weapons out.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.791
Last chance, Harrold!

00:52.120 --> 00:53.553
(clattering)

00:56.560 --> 00:58.790
Fuck.
(exhales sharply)

00:59.320 --> 01:00.594
Fuckin'...

01:00.680 --> 01:01.874
- (door thuds)
- Ahh!

01:01.960 --> 01:03.678
- Shit.
- (clattering)

01:05.080 --> 01:06.718
Harrold! Harrold?

01:09.240 --> 01:11.834
- Harrold: Fuck! Fuck you!
- Fucking kidding me!

01:11.920 --> 01:13.911
You fucking guys
can't kick the fuckin' door?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.736
- Harrold, get some clothes on!
- I got my hands up.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.496
- Don't fucking shoot me!
- Tommy: Shut up! Hey!

01:17.520 --> 01:19.920
What the fuck are you doin'?
You guys gonna just stand there?

01:20.840 --> 01:22.910
Go in there and get him!
Put some clothes on him!

01:23.240 --> 01:25.310
Harrold:
I fuckin' didn't do nothin'!

01:25.400 --> 01:27.231
(overlapping arguing)

01:27.320 --> 01:29.151
(groans)

01:29.240 --> 01:31.276
Fuck did I kick that fuckin' door?

01:31.400 --> 01:33.197
(siren wailing)

01:35.560 --> 01:37.118
- Hey, Commish.
- Chris.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.514
Third floor upstairs.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.160
- Third?
- Yeah.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.816
- What happened with "Shan-creek-a"?
- I was just goin' over there

01:43.840 --> 01:45.990
to have an appointment
with this female,

01:46.080 --> 01:48.435
and this lady came out of nowhere

01:48.520 --> 01:52.115
- and brained me with a smoothie.
- Her daughter says you pushed her.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.156
Sir, I was tryin' to make an escape...

01:54.240 --> 01:56.800
- Did you push her?
- After the smoothie.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.518
- So you did...
- What's up, Tommy.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.637
Whoa! This is an occasion.
Commish exitin' the SUV?

02:01.720 --> 02:04.109
- Is this a homicide?
- It's not. You've been misinformed.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.856
You're fuckin' kiddin' me.
It's not a homicide?

02:05.880 --> 02:08.553
- Nope.
- No, sir. No, sir.

02:08.639 --> 02:11.216
- Why are you bleeding?
- I was trying to tell your officers, sir.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.753
This woman is crazy.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.274
And she hit me with a fuckin'
smoothie in the head.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.136
What are you talkin' about?
Like, a drink or somethin'?

02:17.160 --> 02:19.390
No, like a fuckin' smoothie,
you know?

02:19.480 --> 02:21.675
Like you would smooth
your clothes out with.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.830
- (laughs) An iron? A fuckin' iron?
- Davis: An iron!

02:24.920 --> 02:26.990
- For fuck's sake!
- It's called an iron, Harrold.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.832
- Harrold: Yes, sir, a smoothie.
- Shut up.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.872
Commish, I should be
a captain or a deputy-super

02:31.960 --> 02:33.216
or probably even your job by now.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.753
I can't take much more of this shit.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.029
You dug that hole.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.759
(sighs) You know,
my fuckin' knee is killin' me.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.816
He kicked the fuckin' teeth
out of a vice cop in Back Bay.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.856
How do you fuck your knee up
kickin' a guy in the mouth?

02:42.880 --> 02:44.279
I over-kicked.
I hyper-extended it.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.955
- I thought he fuckin' got suspended.
- Hey! I fuckin' hear you, numb-nuts.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.190
- Sorry, that's what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.468
- I heard that you got suspended.
- Do I look suspended?

02:53.560 --> 02:55.949
- No, sir.
- He doesn't look suspended.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.000
Would I be sittin' here starin' at you two
chowderheads if I was suspended?

02:59.080 --> 03:02.152
No, I wouldn't.
Life is a rigged fucking game.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.754
You two just passed "Go."
Buckle it the fuck up.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.195
- Harrold, you're under arrest.
- Actually accurate.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.431
You go home, put some ice
on that knee, and get some sleep.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.193
- Got the race in five hours.
- Catchin' drunks at the marathon.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.317
Boss, please, don't make me
wear the clown suit.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.391
It's the last hoop, Tommy.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.075
You walk your beat, smile,
and you're officially out of the doghouse.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.673
One more day.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.070
Weather's gonna be nice, pretty girls,
fresh air, be like a big picnic.

03:27.160 --> 03:30.038
Everybody loves a picnic.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.672
- Woman: Pizza delivery for Patrick.
- Hey, baby.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.394
Hey.
How was work?

03:46.480 --> 03:48.835
This sweet old man came in
and gave that to me today.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.238
Mr. Flanagan.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.993
His wife was on my floor
a couple months back.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.878
Stage four, so we were just
there to keep her comfortable.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.270
I guess before she passed,
she told him she wanted me to have it.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.510
- Huh.
- I hardly knew them,

04:02.600 --> 04:05.990
but he was so sweet and so sad,

04:06.080 --> 04:09.550
and I was just holding him
and hugging him.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.910
Look at how pretty that is.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.279
Isn't that beautiful?

04:16.880 --> 04:18.870
And you made me dinner?

04:18.959 --> 04:21.029
- How's your dissertation coming?
- Huh!

04:21.120 --> 04:23.111
- Two paragraphs, both deleted.
- Uh-huh.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.357
And, uh, but I did tag some cool
apartments in San Francisco to show you.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.714
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.075
- Look at you, so excited.
- Well, I'm really excited

04:30.160 --> 04:31.832
that we're taking
the day off tomorrow.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.230
- Mmm.
- And I think after my masterpiece pizza,

04:35.320 --> 04:37.629
we're gonna have to go
on a run at some point.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.119
- Tomorrow? No, honey.
- Yeah.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.080
There's three things
you can do on Patriots Day.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.216
One's watch the marathon,
the other one's run the marathon,

04:43.240 --> 04:46.232
and the third one is get down to Fenway
and yell for those Red Sox.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.197
- Yellin' for the Red Sox.
- Sox.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.748
- Sox.
- Mmm. Red "Sahx."

04:50.840 --> 04:53.035
- Red "Sahx."
- Red "Sahx."

04:53.120 --> 04:54.880
- There you go.
- I think you just wanna stay

04:54.920 --> 04:56.273
in bed with me all day.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.952
- Wanna know what I think?
- Mmm.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.555
I think the reason Mrs. Flanagan
wanted you to have it

05:01.640 --> 05:04.871
was because she knew you would
hold him when he gave it to you.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.639
You're a very sweet man.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.393
- I know. Cheers.
- (chuckles)

05:13.800 --> 05:15.438
To the Red Sox.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.671
Yeah. "Sahx."

05:19.320 --> 05:23.518
- Sox.
- "Sahx."

05:23.600 --> 05:25.079
"Sahx."

05:30.120 --> 05:32.315
(indistinct conversations)

05:46.240 --> 05:48.231
Man: Did you change
the software and shit?

05:48.320 --> 05:50.880
(sighs)
All right, let's see.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.068
Uh, yeah. Got it.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.674
(indistinct)

06:00.920 --> 06:02.399
Yes!

06:12.440 --> 06:14.600
- Hey, Li. What's up, guys?
- Oh, hey, Sean, what's up?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.711
Wow!
What are you feedin' that thing?

06:16.800 --> 06:19.109
It looks like he could
outrun the squad car.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.031
- She definitely could.
- Look at this!

06:21.120 --> 06:22.235
- Can I touch it?
- No.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.112
(laughs) No. No.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.749
So what about
the Zac cowboy concert?

06:27.840 --> 06:29.637
- Zac Brown Band, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.800
Yeah, I'll get ten tickets.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.872
Hey, it's gonna be
a cultural experience, okay?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.554
You're gonna get
a better education than MIT,

06:36.640 --> 06:38.596
Harvard, BU, BC.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.671
I need everybody's hat sizes,
we'll all get hats.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.816
- Man: Yeah, cool.
- Sean: Get right.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.115
- All right, boys.
- Thanks.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.275
Well, listen, you know
I like my chicken fried,

06:48.360 --> 06:51.272
- a cold beer on a Friday night...
- Me, too.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.271
...and my jeans that fit too tight.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.954
- Just right. Your jeans, just right.
- Just right. Just right.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.399
Do you think you'll definitely come?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.751
- Or...
- Yes. I will be there.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.037
Okay. Cool. Yeah.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.352
(dog barking)

07:24.440 --> 07:27.989
- (clatters)
- Oh, Tommy!

07:28.080 --> 07:29.616
I'm sorry. I just gotta
get my clothes for tomorrow.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.757
Tommy, oh, my God.
Get the fuck out of my room.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.908
- But this is our room.
- You know, now I can officially

07:36.000 --> 07:39.436
tell your blood alcohol by the frequency
of key scratches on the lock.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.438
- It's a predictive pattern, Tommy.
- I had two pops, okay?

07:42.520 --> 07:45.273
It's medicinal.
And I got roll call...

07:45.400 --> 07:47.456
- You sound like...
- ...in four hours and 42 minutes.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.516
- ...elephant.
- I'm sorry. All right?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.456
Please, come on, just go.
I'll see you in the morning.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.357
Hey... want me
to cuddle with you?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.317
- No! I told you to leave, Tommy.
- Come on.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.994
- I love you.
- I love you.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.998
- Go on. You're wakin' me up.
- I'm sorry. All right?

08:01.080 --> 08:03.389
- Okay. Quit ya' talkin'.
- Go back to sleep.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.154
(groans)

08:42.320 --> 08:43.878
(man speaking Mandarin)

08:47.120 --> 08:49.111
(Man speaking Mandarin on phone)

09:08.960 --> 09:10.871
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, bye.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.476
(dog barking)

09:25.640 --> 09:27.915
Woman:
You wanna go get your drink?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.995
One on top?
You thirsty?

09:31.720 --> 09:33.836
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.191
(indistinct chattering
on computer)

09:38.040 --> 09:39.473
What do you want?
Juice? Milk?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.916
Girl:
Mommy, Mommy, open.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.914
Here you go, baby.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.955
(water running)

10:05.040 --> 10:06.678
Let's go in the room.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.957
(speaking in foreign language
on computer)

10:45.440 --> 10:46.793
Uniform's dry.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.314
I also swapped out the battery
in your shoulder mic.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.073
(chuckling)

10:53.560 --> 10:55.835
I haven't seen you
in your uniform for a while.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.956
Yeah, that was on purpose.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.838
- Oh, God.
- Come on. Let me see it.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.919
- Don't start.
- Mmm. Kinda turns me on.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.072
- Really?
- Gotta get your hair cut first.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.674
(laughs)
It's at the top of my list.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.035
God, I gotta put this thing on.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.558
- Do I look like a clown?
- (laughs)

11:16.640 --> 11:17.993
- Why are you laughing?
- I'm not.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.536
- I look like a clown.
- No! It's just...

11:19.560 --> 11:20.736
- No, it's okay.
- It's your color.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.400
I'm basically
a crossing guard, all right?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.096
And they send me to the Marathon,
at the finish line

11:24.120 --> 11:27.476
with the biggest VIPs in the city,
and everybody's gonna break my balls.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.233
- You got my whistle and my stop sign?
- Come here. Gimme a kiss.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.272
- I love you.
- I love you.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.576
I'll see you later on, all right?

11:34.600 --> 11:35.656
- All right.
- I'll see you tonight.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.749
Don't kick any cops.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.030
- I'll try not to.
- I hear they hate that.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.678
Sweetheart?
You saw me yesterday, right?

11:54.760 --> 11:57.877
- Woman: Mm-hmm.
- So, is it just me,

11:57.960 --> 11:59.856
or am I gettin' a little
better lookin' every day?

11:59.880 --> 12:03.395
Why don't you come over here, and I'll
show you how good-lookin' you are?

12:03.480 --> 12:04.799
(chuckles)

12:04.880 --> 12:06.871
Boy, I wish I had time for that.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.355
Love you.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.078
What do you want,
a muffin or a bagel?

12:11.160 --> 12:13.549
- Oh, bring me a muffin, please.
- Yes, doll.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.073
- Love you!
- Love you!

12:33.640 --> 12:35.517
- Hey, Tiesha.
- Morning, Sergeant Jeff.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.637
- How's your day today?
- It is a muffin day, sweetheart.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.792
- We got blueberry.
- Oh. You're an angel.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.792
- I try to be, just for you.
- How's school goin'?

12:44.880 --> 12:47.075
The boys leavin' you alone,
lettin' you study?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.236
They are.
They have no choice.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.594
(both chuckle)

12:50.680 --> 12:52.033
- In the cup.
- (coins clink)

12:52.120 --> 12:53.348
- Have a great day.
- You, too.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.160
Man: Right over there,
next to the table.

(indistinct chattering)

13:37.160 --> 13:39.196

13:43.640 --> 13:46.000
Man on radio: Are we feeding
that other video or no time to?

13:47.040 --> 13:48.678
(indistinct chattering continues)

13:53.760 --> 13:56.069
Man:
Nobody in the VIP section at all.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.151
Unless they have credentials, period,
all right?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.878
Nobody.
Hey, Tommy!

13:59.960 --> 14:01.837
- Tommy: What's up?
- I got a favor.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.056
It's actually a gift.
I'm gonna give you the finishin' line.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.354
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.910
This is your welcome back, Tommy.
Means no more fuck-ups.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.275
Just smile in front of all the VIPs

14:11.360 --> 14:13.794
and let 'em all remember
what a great fuckin' guy

14:13.880 --> 14:15.376

- I understand that.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.816
- Can I just talk to you for a second?
- No, no, no, no.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.936
Look, can't you see the beauty
of just sayin' "Thank you"?

14:18.960 --> 14:20.757
- I say, "You're welcome." Huh?
- (sighs)

14:20.880 --> 14:22.560
It's just a trade-off
to get your job back.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.551
- Look...
- Nah.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.279
No more words. I just wanna get
to the Hopkinton, all right?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.874
- What time you gonna run?
- Under three, I hope.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.077
That ain't happenin'.
Good luck.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.536

14:34.560 --> 14:36.073
World's most overpaid meter maid.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.037
- Wow.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.429
You wanna move the barricades?
I gotta get to Hopkinton.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.796
Hey! Well, don't stand around.
He told you to move the barricade, not me.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.633
(beeping)

14:46.720 --> 14:48.836
(sighs) Carol!
I need you to do me a favor.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.399
My knee's gotten swollen fatter.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.153
I gotta have you bring the fatter
knee brace down to me, all right?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.936
I'm at the finish line,
so you'll be able to find me.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.216
All right, I love you, baby.
Thanks.

Yeah, but what about, like-like,

15:07.680 --> 15:10.194
Erik and Rafi
and Brendan and those guys?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.016
I mean, those guys were our friends,
so it's like...

15:12.040 --> 15:15.510
Don't think about 'em.
Doesn't matter.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.348
Bro, I'm...
Look, I'm not pussin' out or nothin'.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.796
I'm not at all. I'm just thinkin' about
Martin Luther King, and like...

15:31.880 --> 15:34.678
Martin Luther King
was not a Muslim.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.751
He was a hypocrite.
He was a fornicator.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.314
Yeah, but I'm a fornicator.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.238
You think that's funny?

15:44.960 --> 15:47.030
No.

The elite men in the 117th running

17:37.480 --> 17:41.359
the oldest running marathon
in the United States.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.830
You can see that the crowd
has thickened to about four deep

17:44.920 --> 17:47.559
at some places there along
this course in Hopkinton...

17:56.320 --> 17:58.276

That's atrocious.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.396
And this guy owes me 20 bucks.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.239
Watch your hand, man.
And what do I owe you $20 for again?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.278

- You didn't talk to her.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.976
Get the fuck outta here.
You talked to her?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.656
She said she's comin'
to the Zac Brown concert.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.114
- Big mistake.
- Nice MIT girl?

18:16.240 --> 18:17.798
She'll love it.
She'll be smitten.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.394
Gotta take her to something
classy, like the Pops.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.471

18:22.560 --> 18:24.835

25:14.720 --> 25:16.312
The knee hurts.
The back hurts.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.992
The balls hurt.
The pain sometimes feels

25:18.080 --> 25:19.256
like it hurts
on top of the hurt,

25:19.280 --> 25:20.456
- if that's even remotely possible.
- (cell phone rings)

25:20.480 --> 25:22.675
This is Davis.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.591
No, the Biden call's
scheduled for 3:00.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.456
Biden? Vice President Biden?
Hey, let me talk to him.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.914
- Behave yourself, Tommy.
- Commissioner, let me talk to him!

25:29.000 --> 25:30.558
Guys! The lobster's back!

25:30.640 --> 25:32.517
Come here!
Cuff that lobster, will you?

25:35.840 --> 25:38.229
(indistinct radio chatter)

25:39.560 --> 25:40.754
Whoo!

25:43.880 --> 25:46.394
(indistinct announcement on P.A.)

25:53.840 --> 25:56.559
Announcer: The finalists
in the wheelchair competition here...

25:58.080 --> 26:00.680
Announcer #2:...very fast runners
here out on this storied course.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.278
So much history today.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.033
To all the runners
and our team behind the scenes,

26:05.120 --> 26:07.156
thank you for bringing this race...

26:14.360 --> 26:16.590
- (alarms blaring)
- (people screaming)

26:44.720 --> 26:46.870
Those are bombs, Captain!
Those are bombs!

26:47.280 --> 26:49.840
This is Delta 984!
We got multiple explosions! We need...

26:49.960 --> 26:52.155
(alarm blaring)

26:57.360 --> 26:59.112
(clamoring)

27:16.640 --> 27:18.835
(child crying)

27:23.800 --> 27:25.233
(screaming)

27:41.760 --> 27:42.760
Shit!

27:46.120 --> 27:48.190
(indistinct shouting)

27:55.000 --> 27:58.470
All medical personnel
to the finish line! Now!

27:58.560 --> 28:00.312
Something just exploded
at the finish line.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.311
What did he say?
Let's turn around, Q.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.594
(tires screeching)

28:10.800 --> 28:12.791
I repeat, multiple casualties!

28:12.880 --> 28:14.472
(woman sobbing)

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400
I got you.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.594
Sir, you're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.000
Ma'am, hold on to this
as tight as you can.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.076
Hey, get that wheelchair
over here now!

28:25.760 --> 28:27.876
All medical personnel
to the finish line!

28:29.880 --> 28:32.269
- We need two over here!
- Repeat, multiple casualties!

28:32.360 --> 28:34.669
- Carol: Tommy!
- Carol!

28:34.760 --> 28:37.911
- You okay? Huh? Lemme see.
- (crying)

28:38.360 --> 28:40.874
All right. You're okay. You're okay.
Hey, Sully, come here!

28:40.960 --> 28:43.428
Carol, go with him now!
Get her home now!

28:43.520 --> 28:44.748
Dispatch:
Repeat your location!

28:44.840 --> 28:46.751
This is Delta 984!
I'm at the finish line!

28:46.840 --> 28:48.520
Dispatcher:
I only wanna hear from the 984!

28:48.560 --> 28:50.278
I only wanna hear
from that supervisor.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.536
All right, this is what I need.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.028
I want Ring Road clear,
so I can push ambulances in and out!

28:54.160 --> 28:55.718
Keep pushin' in those ambulances!

29:02.920 --> 29:04.797
(indistinct radio chatter)

29:06.440 --> 29:07.998
(sirens wailing)

29:08.600 --> 29:10.556
Okay. People are coming.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.552
Ma'am, you're on fire.
That's it.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.668
(people groaning)

29:26.440 --> 29:27.668
Man: Oh, shit!

29:31.400 --> 29:32.515
Man: Sir?

29:32.600 --> 29:34.989
Can we get some help, sir?
Anyone, sir, please?

29:35.080 --> 29:36.080
Yeah.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.470
You're okay. You're okay.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.834
- (crying)
- You're okay.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.760
We gotta take your son
and get him some help.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.472
Leo! Leo!

29:53.800 --> 29:55.358
You're gonna be okay, sir.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.596
You all right? You hear me?

30:03.480 --> 30:04.480
You're okay.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.915
I can't...

30:07.000 --> 30:08.228
Man:
We'll figure this out.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.958
- I'll find you in just a minute.
- Jess...

30:12.080 --> 30:14.036
(sirens wailing)

30:16.520 --> 30:17.839
Get the wheelchairs!
Come on!

30:20.800 --> 30:23.075
(helicopter hovering)

30:25.960 --> 30:27.720
EMT: Both of her legs
are severely lacerated.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.240
- On three, ready?
- This is my wife.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.395
She's gonna be okay.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.719
Hey! Send two more ambulances
from Ring Road right now!

30:37.800 --> 30:40.394
On radio: This is Sergeant Davis
at the Forum Cafe.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.869
I need personnel at
the second bomb site immediately!

30:44.320 --> 30:45.753
I need assistance!

30:45.840 --> 30:48.070
(panting)

30:48.600 --> 30:51.558
This is Delta 984.
I'm heading to the second bomb site!

30:51.640 --> 30:53.471
Everybody, keep this line clear!

30:53.560 --> 30:57.758
And stop letting runners through!
Secure the perimeter!

30:57.840 --> 31:00.718
If I see another runner,
your ass is done!

31:10.880 --> 31:12.836
Woman: We need a fuckin'
ambulance over here!

31:12.920 --> 31:14.920
We need ambulances down
at the second bombing site!

31:15.000 --> 31:16.558
Starbucks and the Forum!

31:16.640 --> 31:18.320
Are there more bombs?
Are there more bombs?

31:18.360 --> 31:19.816
No, no, no, no.
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.976
- You're doin' good, all right?
- What's that? What's that?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.680
Don't look at that!
Look at me! Look at me!

31:23.760 --> 31:25.159
Get that over here now!

31:25.240 --> 31:27.674
Guys, shut down the race!

31:27.760 --> 31:30.513
Do not have another person
run down Boylston Street!

31:30.600 --> 31:32.795
Come on, get her up, get her up!
Shut down the race!

31:32.880 --> 31:35.348
Fuck, Tommy!
We've got two fatalities.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.159
We got two fatalities,
and a fuckin' kid, eight years old.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.336
- Where's his family?
- They're wounded.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.656
They fuckin' dragged
everybody out.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.816
- For fuck's sake, what do we do?
- I don't fuckin' know.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.056
We gotta leave someone with him.
We cannot leave him here alone, Captain.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.216
No, we're gonna get
someone by his side.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.376
- I ain't goin anywhere.
- We need everybody

31:47.400 --> 31:48.496
out of the area immediately.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.936
We gotta clear the perimeter.
Could be more bombs.

31:49.960 --> 31:50.960
Yeah, I'm on it.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.440
Hey!

31:55.080 --> 31:56.991
Anyone in here? Anyone?

32:06.640 --> 32:08.119
- Shit!
- (cell phone chimes)

32:12.120 --> 32:14.509
This is Delta 984.
We gotta confiscate all cell phones.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.720
Repeat. If you see anyone recordin',
grab their phones, I don't care who it is!

32:19.640 --> 32:20.789
Man:
They gotta find my boy.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.189
Somebody, please...

32:23.280 --> 32:24.838
EMT: Don't worry.
We'll find him, sir.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.439
I don't know where he is.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.036
(indistinct on radio)

32:39.480 --> 32:41.216
Lee, I'm James. I'm going to
take care of you, all right?

32:41.240 --> 32:42.309
You're going to be fine.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.114
(indistinct chattering)

32:53.280 --> 32:55.794
Nurse: Can you feel that?
Can you wiggle your toes?

32:56.800 --> 32:58.631
Good. Good, good, good.
We're good.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.280
Doctor:
We're gonna save your leg, okay?

33:00.320 --> 33:02.390
Hey, you gotta help me
find my son.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.517
His name is Leo Woolfenden.
He's three years old.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.511
We got separated somehow.
Somebody took him.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.636
I just didn't...
You need to find him.

33:09.720 --> 33:14.032
His name is Leo Woolfenden.
W-O-O-L...

33:24.680 --> 33:26.736
Tommy: Push out and make sure
we're keepin' people out of the perimeter.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.593
- All right? Get moving.
- We've got a six-block perimeter set up.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.035
- We're all locked down here.
- (sirens wailing)

33:34.880 --> 33:38.998
Oh, boy.
Here we go. Here we go.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.397
- This is the first blast scene?
- Tommy: Yeah.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.976
The second was down there
at the Forum restaurant.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.416
- Bradshaw: Total station en route.
- Okay, we need TEDAC and OPU.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.096
- What about cell phones, cameras?
- Yeah, we're right on top of that.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.775
Yeah, we're collecting cell phones,
surveillance tapes,

34:27.800 --> 34:30.295
- all the video we can find.
- Get 'em all, Tommy. Don't miss any.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.456
How big is the secured perimeter?

34:31.480 --> 34:32.856
Six blocks off the course
each direction.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.030
- Let's extend that. Make it 10.
- You got it.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.136
It's clearly coordinated.
There could be more bombs.

34:37.159 --> 34:40.277
- How many total wounded?
- Got three fatalities that we know of.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.954
One's a little child on the street
in front of the Forum.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.793
- (clattering)
- What are they doin'?

34:45.880 --> 34:47.856
What? I said that's
an eight-year-old kid under there.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.536
No, they can't move the body.
We've gotta clear them out.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.616
Tell them to clear out of there!

34:50.639 --> 34:51.896
- You got it, you got it.
- Tell them to clear out of there.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.416
- Who the fuck are you?
- Sorry, Sergeant.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.591
Could be clues in the blood-splattered
bomb residue on the boy's body.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.352
We can't risk moving him.
Nothing moves.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.336
What's the matter with you guys?
You gonna tell that boy's parents

35:00.360 --> 35:02.216
that their son's still
lyin' on the fuckin' street?

35:02.240 --> 35:03.696
- Turn it down, Tommy.
- Oh, fuck that!

35:03.720 --> 35:05.950
- Tommy! Let's go over there.
- All right, Billy...

35:06.080 --> 35:07.520
Just fuckin' leave me alone,
will ya?

35:07.560 --> 35:11.473
We've gotta decide who's running this,
and we have to decide quickly.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.391
If it's terrorism,
it's yours, Rick.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.711
Gentlemen, the moment we label
this terrorism, everything changes.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.718
It's not about Boston anymore.
It's not a local investigation.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.109
It's Wolf Blitzer.
It's stock markets.

35:22.200 --> 35:26.990
It's politicians and knee-jerk reactions,
anti-Muslim backlash...

35:27.080 --> 35:28.399
And what if we're wrong?

35:28.520 --> 35:30.656
I mean, there's no take-back.
I've been through this before.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.750
Look, your call,
but we already know it is.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.229
And a cell is activated,
they hit Chicago or New York

35:35.360 --> 35:36.839
or Washington,
what happens then?

35:36.920 --> 35:39.388
The accusations are gonna come,
no matter what we do.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.152
(clatters)

36:02.240 --> 36:04.515
It's terrorism.
We'll take it.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.111
So, what do you need?

36:10.080 --> 36:13.117
Command center.
Really big one.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.151
- (sirens wailing)
- (helicopter hovering)

36:32.120 --> 36:33.792
This'll do.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.471
I want CART team over there.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.835
Post-blast investigators
in that corner.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.592
We need a media tent set up.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.160
All right, let's get an evidence grid

36:43.240 --> 36:45.231
started right over there
against that wall.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.595
And I guarantee
these are gonna crash,

36:47.680 --> 36:49.910
so let's get a bank of
landlines up immediately.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.752
We're good, boss.
We'll be up in an hour.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.875
(reporters clamoring)

36:52.960 --> 36:54.896
Reporter: Commissioner Davis,
the "New York Post" is reporting

36:54.920 --> 36:57.673
a 20-year-old Saudi national
has been charged.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.432
- Can you confirm?
- That is false.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.750
We have not charged
anyone at this time.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.230
We are asking the public to help us
supplement the investigation.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.914
Anyone with photos
or video of the marathon

37:08.000 --> 37:10.639
is encouraged to turn them in
to Boston Police.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.392
(indistinct chattering)

37:12.480 --> 37:14.736
I need you to give me access
to the following databases...

37:14.760 --> 37:16.159
Travel, Visa...

37:16.240 --> 37:18.536
Someone needs to get on the phone
with the United States Attorney's office.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.869
Get us some warrants for
the cell phone towers right now.

37:20.960 --> 37:24.316
AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile,
all the way down the track.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.517
Let T actical Aviation know, as of right
now, Boston owns both those planes.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.518
Get them both to Logan.
No, I'm talkin' about the T-5's.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.313
They're gonna be cycling from
Logan to Quantico. That's it.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.920
FBI servers just got 12,000
e-mails in under a minute.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.115
Holy Christ.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.112
And we're crashed.
Get us back online now.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.560
- Agent: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Now.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.960
Nurse: 28-year-old female,
Jessica Kensky.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.474
- Nurse #2: Pulse, 101.
- Nurse #3: BP's 84 over 45.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.216
Doctor: Think the best
that we could do is a BKA.

37:53.240 --> 37:56.550
The soft tissue's also compromised.
I don't think this is salvageable.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.456
Doctor #2: There's way
too much soft tissue damage.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.240
We gotta take it.
There's nothin' left here.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.376
Doctor #3: I need some saline.
We need to wipe off this flap.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.616
Nurse #4:
Male, late 20s with no ID.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.160
Doctor #3:
The leg is not looking good.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.710
All right, the vessels are controlled,
but there is no viability here.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.950
Absolutely no blood supply.
We'll have to amputate.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.155
Saw.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.954
(whirring)

38:20.840 --> 38:22.876
Doctor:
Amputating below the knee, left leg.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.552
(saw whirring)

38:29.360 --> 38:31.828
(indistinct radio chatter)

38:52.880 --> 38:54.711
(indistinct chatter)

38:58.000 --> 38:59.672
Analyst:
We're recreating the scene.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.194
Put every item down
exactly where it was found.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.880
Analyst #2:
We need this spread out here.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.712
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Lay some paper down.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.960
Let the stuff air dry.
I don't want to degrade the DNA.

39:08.040 --> 39:12.033
Carol? Pick up the phone!
Carol, can you hear me?

39:12.160 --> 39:13.600
Analyst #2:
Get this paper over here.

39:13.680 --> 39:17.389
If you come across any clothing
that's burnt or charred, separate that.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.520
I need to have somebody collect these
cell phones here, get 'em down to CART.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.696
Deslauriers:
Okay, people, remember,

39:21.720 --> 39:23.976
- the bombs had to be carried in somehow.
- Carol, you gotta call me back

39:24.000 --> 39:25.416
as soon as you get
this message, all right?

39:25.440 --> 39:28.477
...on large bags and/or backpacks.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.536
Analyst:
Sort these out by adapter types.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.552
Anything with a camera, we need
to get over to the import station.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.600
Analyst: Are those GPS tags
comin' through okay?

39:35.680 --> 39:36.908
Tech: Yes, sir.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.036
Davis: All right.
Yeah, I got him right here.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.030
JFK Library's not an explosion.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.599
(indistinct conversations)

39:43.680 --> 39:45.159
(cell phone ringing)

39:46.160 --> 39:48.754
Hello? Oh, Carol!
I've been calling and calling!

39:48.840 --> 39:50.432
Tommy, Jesus.
Are you okay?

39:50.520 --> 39:52.909
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
You're not hurt, are ya?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.638
I'm fine, Tommy.
My mother's here.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.976
- Everybody's here.
- Oh, thank God!

39:56.000 --> 39:57.069
The news is going crazy.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.576
They're sayin'
there could be more bombs.

39:58.600 --> 40:02.195
- Please be careful, Tommy.
- I will. I gotta go, all right?

40:02.280 --> 40:04.714
I'm gonna call you
as soon as I can.

40:04.800 --> 40:05.869
I love you.

40:07.080 --> 40:10.675
Hey, Sarge, heard you on the radio
this afternoon. Hell of a job.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.776
I thought I heard your
squeaky-ass voice in my ear.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.976
Don't fuck around right now,
Mike, please?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.440
I'm not fuckin' around.
You did good.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.919
Hey, honey, it's me.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.955
Sweetheart,
I've got out one day too late.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.310
I will. No.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.237
I love you, too.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.456
What are those guys doin' here?
They weren't even down there!

40:29.480 --> 40:30.536
What the fuck is this, a joke?

40:30.560 --> 40:33.096
They're the FBI and they're in charge,
Tommy, so just do as you're told.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.951
And their boss,
I wouldn't wanna be that guy.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.190
He's triple-fucked.
One, he steps up and takes it.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.056
- Two, now he's gotta solve the thing.
- What's three?

40:39.080 --> 40:40.856
He's gotta walk around
inside that life all day long.

40:40.880 --> 40:43.480
- Fuckin' shoot me four times and...
- Billy: Button it up, Tommy.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.896
These young guys
are lookin' up to you.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.558
I don't need the ass-ache
from you today.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.471
- Just do as you're fuckin' told!
- Fine.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.233
We have no evidence
this was a suicide attack.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.232
So these IED's were most likely
remotely detonated.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.914
It is highly probable
these bombs were homemade.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.833
It is likely that they made more.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.990
What does Mass State think?

41:02.080 --> 41:04.296
I think we need to get air assets
from the National Guard.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.216
I think we need a couple
additional tactical teams.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.992
But most importantly,
there's two bathrooms

41:08.080 --> 41:09.911
in this place,
and one's broken.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.115
Right, I'll get on to that.

41:11.200 --> 41:15.193
It is safe to say that we're dealing
with more than one individual,

41:15.280 --> 41:18.317
- some degree of sophistication.
- Excuse me, Agent Deh-law-ray?

41:18.400 --> 41:20.656
- Davis: Special Agent DesLauriers.
- Tommy: Sorry about that.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.696
- Look, I just wanted to say...
- It's not the time or place.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.472
I just want to say,
I work Homicide.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.790
I know one thing closes cases...
witnesses.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.520
So we oughta get our asses
to the hospital, interview the victims.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.993
Could be someone
saw somethin', no?

41:31.080 --> 41:32.513
Tommy, get some of
our guys on this.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.990
And keep in mind that the bomber
could be among the wounded.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.115
We've seen it before.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.953
So let's get positive lD's on everybody
comin' into the hospital.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.040
(cell phone chimes)

41:41.600 --> 41:43.976
Tommy: Let's show this cocksucker
he messed with the wrong fuckin' city.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.136
News anchor: We're getting
conflicting reports about the arrest

41:46.160 --> 41:47.798
of a Saudi national earlier.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.871
Now, Commissioner Davis
at this time is insisting

41:49.960 --> 41:51.996
that no suspects
have been arrested.

41:52.080 --> 41:55.311
Katherine: Dzhokhar! I asked you
to get whole milk. This is two percent.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.600
It's milk. She's a baby.
She can't taste the difference.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.319
No, she can't,
but I will when she gets sick.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.416
Feed the baby in the bedroom.
I can't hear the news.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.616
Katherine:
What am I supposed to give her?

42:03.640 --> 42:05.176
- This isn't gonna work.
- Feed the baby in the bedroom.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.336
- I can't hear...
- Katherine: I needed whole milk!

42:06.360 --> 42:09.238
I'll take care of it! Feed her
in the bedroom right now! Go!

42:10.640 --> 42:12.392
Make him get whole milk.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.736
We shouldn't have put
the bombs ground level.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.671
We shoulda
put that shit waist-high.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.910
- Go get the right milk, Dzhokhar. Go!
- What? No.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.640
I don't wanna hear any more of
her bullshit. Go get the right milk.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.656
Tommy: Mind if I ask you
a couple of questions?

42:54.680 --> 42:56.136
Did you see anything
out of the ordinary?

42:56.160 --> 42:57.216
- Anything suspicious?
- Nah.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.310
Did you see anybody
put bags down or...

42:59.400 --> 43:02.472
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.750
Has anybody spoken
to you guys yet?

43:04.840 --> 43:06.512
No? What's your name, sweetie?

43:09.880 --> 43:11.576
My knee's killing me.
You got some Tylenol back there?

43:11.600 --> 43:13.536
We got all kinds of stuff, Sergeant.
You want a Vicodin?

43:13.560 --> 43:14.816
- No, no Vicodin. Tylenol.
- Tylenol, Tylenol.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.760
- Make it four pills, please.
- Okay, you got it.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.720
Thank you.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.790
Hey, do we have a name on him yet?

44:14.920 --> 44:17.673
No, the EMT said he was
with his wife at the site.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.831
But all I've got is this ring.

44:20.920 --> 44:24.151
It's engraved
"PB and J. 8-25-12."

44:25.120 --> 44:28.715
- She's gotta be in a different hospital.
- Let me call around.

44:29.640 --> 44:32.256
Reporter: They are still keeping people
out of this area, obviously.

44:32.280 --> 44:35.477
Still that 15-block area
that was mentioned earlier.

44:37.120 --> 44:39.156
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.789
- It's fried rice? Eggroll?
- Yeah. Everything's in there.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.518
Okay.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.238
(reporter chattering on TV)

44:46.320 --> 44:48.436
Meng:
It's a very scary day today.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.237
My name is Danny.
What was your name?

44:54.320 --> 44:55.548
(laughing)
My name's Kara.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.676
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

44:57.760 --> 45:01.070
- Are you from Boston?
- Yeah, I live here.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.913
Oh, I live in Cambridge.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.389
- Oh, that's not far.
- No.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.256
Radio announcer: The FBI
has taken over the criminal investigation

45:14.280 --> 45:15.508
into the bombings.

45:15.600 --> 45:18.353
The Bureau is asking you
for any visual...

45:18.440 --> 45:20.032
- Hey, John.
- Hey, what's up?

45:20.120 --> 45:22.588
- This fucking bombing, huh?
- Awful.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.796
- Are we gonna supplement this?
- Not that I know of.

45:24.880 --> 45:27.189
It's all BPD.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.271
- What do you got?
- Everything's busted.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.588
The radio bracket's loose.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.736
The right window goes down
when I put on the blinker.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.955
Tell me this thing
about the blinker?

45:35.040 --> 45:37.759
Yeah, it goes down,
but only when I signal right.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.216
Radio announcer:
'Course, the big question this morning...

45:41.240 --> 45:43.435
- Who did this?
- That is fuckin' weird.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.078
And why did they do this?

45:51.040 --> 45:54.237
(whispering) Excuse me. Sir?
Sorry to disturb you.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.595
- Is this Jessica Kensky?
- Yes. She's my daughter.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.992
- (crying)
- Hey, I understand.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.816
- I can come back, okay?
- No, that's... Sorry.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.353
How can we help you?

46:03.440 --> 46:05.431
I just wanna know
if she said anything at all?

46:05.520 --> 46:07.636
- If she communicated anything?
- Not much.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.475
She just asked
about her husband.

46:11.560 --> 46:15.473
We don't know where he is.
His name is Patrick Downes.

46:16.560 --> 46:20.030
- Can you help us find him?
- You leave that to us, okay?

46:20.120 --> 46:22.350
- Okay?
- (sniffles) Thank you.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.471
(brakes screeching)

46:37.360 --> 46:39.191
My God. Oh...

46:41.120 --> 46:42.519
(TV playing)

46:43.480 --> 46:44.515
(keys clatter)

46:44.600 --> 46:46.158
- Hey.
- What are you guys doin' here?

46:46.280 --> 46:48.016
What the fuck happened out there?
What's goin' on?

46:48.040 --> 46:50.634
Is this fuckin' Al-Qaeda or what?
Was it Al-Qaeda?

46:50.720 --> 46:52.472
Are you fuckin' eating
Cheerios on my couch?

46:52.560 --> 46:54.576
- Carol: Hey, Tommy...
- Who did it? What are they sayin'?

46:54.600 --> 46:56.909
(overlapping chattering)

46:57.040 --> 46:59.349
What happened?
Listen, was it Al-Qaeda or what?

46:59.440 --> 47:00.919
(overlapping chattering continues)

47:01.000 --> 47:02.991
We're gonna give him
some space, all right?

47:03.080 --> 47:05.355
Does someone wanna tell us
what the hell happened?

47:05.440 --> 47:08.432
Get everybody outta here. Get the...
get the fuck outta here now!

47:08.520 --> 47:11.034
- Every fuckin' one of you!
- Come on! What the hell did I do?

47:11.120 --> 47:12.758
What do you mean?
Fuckin' come on!

47:12.840 --> 47:14.637
- Sorry!
- Get the fuck outta here!

47:14.720 --> 47:17.200
Whatever you want, Tommy.
Whatever you need, whatever you need.

47:19.560 --> 47:22.870
- (indistinct conversations)
- Analyst: Blue coat.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.112
Analyst #2:
I've got a street-block radius.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.438
Analyst #3:
Yeah, it's a little grainy.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.353
Time doesn't match it.

47:39.120 --> 47:41.111
Analyst #3: You got 'em?

47:55.680 --> 47:59.389
(breathes heavily)
I don't... I don't know.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.511
Carol: It's okay, baby.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.155
I don't even understand what I saw.

48:07.640 --> 48:10.393
I keep seein' this blood.
It's, like, everywhere.

48:11.160 --> 48:14.038
(sighs)
I saw a foot next to...

48:16.400 --> 48:19.472
This boy from...
Well, I think from Marathon Sport.

48:19.560 --> 48:23.109
He looked like a little BU kid.
Like a good kid, Carol, you know?

48:24.160 --> 48:27.038
He had an assistant manager tag

48:27.120 --> 48:29.236
and, um...

48:29.320 --> 48:31.629
he helped, we moved her.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.558
We... we laid her down.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.960
Blood just started to spread,
his knee was in her blood...

48:41.680 --> 48:43.671
And then there was
an eight-year-old boy.

48:43.760 --> 48:46.069
(sobbing)
He was just layin' there.

48:46.160 --> 48:49.914
They had to take his family away,
and his parents, and fuck, he's fuckin'...

48:55.360 --> 48:57.430
I got these images in my head.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.034
They ain't goin' away.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.588
And you were right there.

49:05.280 --> 49:07.953
Please don't be mad at me
that I told you to come down there.

49:08.040 --> 49:09.951
I shouldn't have told you
to come down there.

49:10.040 --> 49:12.918
You never could have known.
Baby, it's not your fault.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.150
I'm sorry, Carol.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.913
I'm sorry that I told you to come.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.991
I'm sorry that I put you there.

49:29.240 --> 49:31.120
Tommy: We gotta find
these motherfuckers, Carol.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.355
We gotta get out there
and find these motherfuckers

49:33.440 --> 49:34.919
before they do this
to somebody else.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.353
Analyst:
Back it up three seconds.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.435
Boss!

50:24.920 --> 50:26.876
This guy. White hat.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.113
Play it again.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.435
Butler:
He's the only one that looks away.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.832
(groans)

50:56.520 --> 50:58.192
(cell phone ringing)

51:06.480 --> 51:09.711
Davis: Feds wanna talk to you.
Rick. Sergeant Saunders.

51:10.280 --> 51:12.111
Thank you for coming so quickly.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.918
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.877
Ed tells me you're familiar
with this area?

51:15.960 --> 51:17.473
Yeah, why?

51:18.960 --> 51:21.474
- Deslauriers: Let's run it.
- White Hat.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.109
Play it back.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.912
The guy right there
with the white hat?

51:30.480 --> 51:32.232
- That's the guy, isn't it?
- We believe so.

51:32.320 --> 51:33.958
It's gotta be.

51:34.040 --> 51:36.793
Okay, so I am White Hat.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.871
At exactly 2:45,

51:38.960 --> 51:43.556
I am seen by the surveillance videos
outside the Forum restaurant, okay?

51:43.640 --> 51:47.428
Now, Sergeant, as you can see, we've
recreated the Boylston Street crime scene.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.916
Now, let's move left of boom.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.671
Left of what?

51:54.760 --> 51:57.558
Left of boom.
Left of the explosions.

51:57.640 --> 52:01.474
We need to trace him backwards.
You know this street, right?

52:01.560 --> 52:03.869
And you know which places
have security cameras?

52:03.960 --> 52:05.336
Yeah, yeah.
I know what you're doin'.

52:05.360 --> 52:07.954
That's the finish line there.
You said 2:45?

52:08.040 --> 52:09.553
Correct.

52:09.640 --> 52:12.632
All right, so where is he at 2:44?
Who can see him?

52:14.480 --> 52:17.438
- It's gotta be Crate & Barrel.
- Crate & Barrel, anybody?

52:17.520 --> 52:19.158
Analyst:
Checking Crate & Barrel.

52:26.480 --> 52:27.799
Tech: Yes, sir!

52:28.560 --> 52:30.835
I see you. 2:44 p.m.

52:30.920 --> 52:34.037
The hat's got a golf logo along
with the number three.

52:34.120 --> 52:37.351
Okay. I wanna find every store
in Boston that's selling that hat.

52:37.440 --> 52:38.816
Pull the names from
the credit card receipts...

52:38.840 --> 52:39.840
Crate & Barrel.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.576
...then cross-check it
against facial recognitions.

52:41.600 --> 52:45.195
Okay, Sergeant.
I'm Crate & Barrel at 2:44.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.793
Who sees me now?

52:46.880 --> 52:49.713
It's the Walgreen's
that's across the street now.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.314
- Abe 'n Louie's?
- Deslauriers: Abe 'n Louie?

52:52.400 --> 52:53.800
Analyst #2:
Checking Abe 'n Louie's.

52:57.160 --> 52:59.833
- Anybody got Abe 'n Louie?
- Tech #2: Nothing, sir.

52:59.920 --> 53:01.876
- No?
- No, sir.

53:04.960 --> 53:06.296
Deslauriers: Come on, Sergeant.
Where else?

53:06.320 --> 53:08.629
Gimme a minute, all right?
Lemme think. Um...

53:10.640 --> 53:12.915
Across the street, the Mandarin...
The Mandarin?

53:13.040 --> 53:15.395
Nah, their cameras
face the wrong direction.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.351
(muttering)

53:18.960 --> 53:21.155
Remember, that kid
stole a purse from Solas?

53:21.240 --> 53:22.912
He ran into Peet's.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.072
Ah, I got it...
Um, Back Bay Social Club!

53:26.160 --> 53:27.760
Teddy put in new
patio cameras last year.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.438
Back Bay Social Club.

53:29.520 --> 53:31.317
Analyst:
Searching Back Bay Social Club.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.351
I got him!

53:37.320 --> 53:39.788
Back Bay Social Club.
2:40 p.m.

53:39.880 --> 53:43.350
I have a new angle on his face.
His left eye, the chin.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.795
It's still not clear enough
for facial recognitions.

53:48.800 --> 53:53.032
All right, push that out to CART team,
see if they can fill in the blanks.

53:56.960 --> 53:59.110
Doin' great, Sergeant.
Keep going.

54:00.680 --> 54:03.956
All right. 2:42 p.m.
Whiskey's Steak House.

54:04.040 --> 54:06.952
- Whiskey's Steak House!
- Analyst: Whiskey's Steak House!

54:10.960 --> 54:14.350
Got him. 2:37.
White Hat's standing with someone.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.397
It's a man wearing aviators.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.119
Looks like they know each other.

54:21.200 --> 54:24.510
Motherfucker!
You fuckin' piece 'a shit!

54:28.000 --> 54:29.479
Two bombers.

54:33.560 --> 54:35.039
- Give me a kiss.
- No!

54:35.120 --> 54:36.633
- Then get out.
- Stop it.

54:36.720 --> 54:37.720
Get out.

54:37.800 --> 54:40.040
There you go. You gotta put
the bunny, like, right there.

54:40.080 --> 54:41.752
No.

54:41.880 --> 54:43.598
- Yes. What?
- No.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.999
What do you mean, no?

54:45.080 --> 54:46.696
News anchor:
...still a very heavy police presence.

54:46.720 --> 54:50.918
The FBI reportedly zeroing in
on a possible suspect.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.616
They figured that out
quicker than you thought, huh?

54:53.640 --> 54:56.313
And amid all the questions
about a possible suspect today...

54:56.400 --> 54:57.719
Come on. I'll help you.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.336
Dzhokhar: Your baby doesn't
know how to tie her shoes.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.839
Katherine: I've got it.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.518
- Jahar?
- Nah, I don't want any.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.536
News anchor:
...caused chaos in the markets today.

55:05.560 --> 55:07.096
News anchor #2:
It also, we understand, forced the FBI

55:07.120 --> 55:09.315
to cancel what was
a scheduled news conference.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.550
It has never been
rescheduled since.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.995
How can we have zero hits
on facial recognition?

55:14.120 --> 55:16.856
Well, the technology isn't perfect,
Governor, we've got partial images.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.029
We've got bad angles.

55:18.120 --> 55:19.951
These are pretty clear
fucking pictures.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.576
One of the suspects
is wearing sunglasses.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.216
- Run it through the NSA's system.
- We're using the NSA's system, sir.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.515
We need to get these
photos out to the public.

55:26.600 --> 55:29.194
Not yet. We have a couple of
decent leads, but right now...

55:29.280 --> 55:31.350
We release these photos,
the city eats these guys.

55:31.440 --> 55:32.475
No, I agree.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.136
So why don't you
get over there and say somethin'?

55:34.160 --> 55:36.240
Look, this is Ed's fuckin' deal
right now, all right?

55:36.320 --> 55:39.118
These guys are somebody's friends,
neighbors, co-workers.

55:39.200 --> 55:41.873
- You got no balls.
- I've got fucking plenty of balls.

55:41.960 --> 55:43.216
I'm not gettin' involved
with the Governor.

55:43.240 --> 55:44.336
I'll go over there
and say somethin'.

55:44.360 --> 55:45.416
You wanna get yourself
suspended again?

55:45.440 --> 55:47.590
If we release those photos now,
it tells the suspects

55:47.680 --> 55:49.238
that we don't know who they are,

55:49.320 --> 55:51.296
- and that puts them ahead of us...
- That's true, but...

55:51.320 --> 55:53.038
But what?
But what if we're wrong?

55:53.160 --> 55:54.336
What if these men are innocent?

55:54.360 --> 55:55.976
And God forbid,
they also happen to be Muslims,

55:56.000 --> 55:57.479
we will be crucified!

55:57.560 --> 55:59.630
They don't look like
prototypical jihadists to me.

55:59.720 --> 56:01.680
What does a prototypical
jihadist look like, Rick?

56:01.760 --> 56:03.079
You got a photo of one?

56:03.160 --> 56:05.390
Okay, listen, that all sounds
very by-the-book, Rick,

56:05.480 --> 56:07.152
okay, but we owe people answers.

56:07.240 --> 56:09.674
We can't just sit back
and keep analyzing data.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.394
What does your gut tell you?

56:12.480 --> 56:15.995
My gut tells me that
these are probably our guys.

56:16.080 --> 56:19.675
But I'm not ready
to release the photos.

56:19.760 --> 56:22.354
Gotta give our people
some more time to work.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.589
Okay. Okay, it's decided.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.479
We'll wait.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.000
News anchor: At this time,
there have been no new developments

56:33.040 --> 56:34.640
regarding the Boston
Marathon bombings...

56:34.680 --> 56:35.896
News anchor #2:
We wish we had better information

56:35.920 --> 56:37.576
as far as them being able to
find somebody right now.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.716
It just seems like
it's an ongoing active search...

56:43.240 --> 56:46.550
President Obama:
It was a beautiful day to be in Boston.

56:46.640 --> 56:50.838
And then, in an instant,

56:50.920 --> 56:53.275
the day's beauty was shattered.

56:55.400 --> 56:59.359
For millions of us,
what happened on Monday is personal.

57:02.960 --> 57:05.110
It's personal.

57:08.040 --> 57:10.873
So we come together
to pray and mourn.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.470
But we also
come together today

57:15.560 --> 57:20.554
to reaffirm that the spirit
of this city is undaunted.

57:22.040 --> 57:25.555
And the spirit of this country
shall remain undimmed.

57:26.800 --> 57:30.429
That's the spirit
you've displayed in recent days.

57:32.480 --> 57:34.550
- Hey. Hey, Li.
- Hey.

57:34.640 --> 57:35.914
- Hey, Sean.
- Oh, hey...

57:36.000 --> 57:37.536
I like those glasses.
Those are new, huh?

57:37.560 --> 57:38.629
Yeah, thanks.

57:38.720 --> 57:41.439
We needed a study break,
so I thought you might like one, too.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.879
Thanks, Li, yeah.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.871
Coffee Coolattas.
These are great.

57:44.960 --> 57:48.236
(chuckles)
Uh, well, we should go back to work.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.595
But, um, Saturday night,
Zac Brown Band?

57:50.680 --> 57:52.557
Yeah, that's right.
Are you guys...

57:52.640 --> 57:54.760
I'll make sure all you guys
are covered, so you're in.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.559
It's just gonna be us.
Is that cool?

57:57.640 --> 58:00.108
- Yeah?
- That's better. Yeah.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.031
- Yeah?
- No, I prefer that, yeah.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.634
- Cool. Bye.
- All right.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.392
Good seein' you guys.

58:09.520 --> 58:12.717
Jeff: All right, let's pipe it down
so I can make this quick, please.

58:12.840 --> 58:15.434
Situation in Boston remains in flux.

58:15.520 --> 58:19.274
Let's be prepared to augment
should they require our assistance.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.396
Uh, speed limit
on Common Street

58:21.480 --> 58:23.994
has now officially been
down to 25 for a month.

58:24.080 --> 58:26.150
So, warning period is over.

58:26.240 --> 58:28.470
Quit giving warnings there
a week ago, Sarge.

58:28.560 --> 58:30.232
I gave Mimi O'Brien a citation

58:30.360 --> 58:32.396
for speeding
and expired registration.

58:32.480 --> 58:34.948
Well, you're a braver man
than I am, Gunga Din.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.318
Davis:
We got an information vacuum.

58:39.400 --> 58:40.913
Those are not our guys.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.638
Meanwhile, you guys
aren't any closer

58:42.720 --> 58:45.029
to identifying the two
we're really lookin' for.

58:45.120 --> 58:47.475
We need to release
those pictures.

58:47.560 --> 58:49.790
If we release the photos now,
we have zero control.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.912
If we overplay our hand,
we may force these guys to react.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.116
Gentlemen, if I may?

58:55.200 --> 58:57.873
Right now,
Boston's workin' against us.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.679
As normal, you've got a murder,
no one rats.

59:00.760 --> 59:03.115
We don't got that problem,
'cause in this city,

59:03.200 --> 59:05.634
when it comes to terrorism,
everybody wants to talk.

59:05.720 --> 59:08.456
Look, you got a lot of people talkin', but
they're talkin' about the wrong people.

59:08.480 --> 59:12.155
You release the photos of our guys,
sit back and listen. Trust me.

59:12.240 --> 59:15.630
You gotta start lettin' Boston
work for us, I'm telling you.

59:15.720 --> 59:18.075
I understand Boston,

59:18.160 --> 59:20.196
but I can't just snap my fingers.

59:20.280 --> 59:22.496
This decision goes all the way up
to the Attorney General.

59:22.520 --> 59:24.556
Then give me his number.
I'll call him right now!

59:24.640 --> 59:26.995
This is my fuckin' city, Rick!

59:27.080 --> 59:28.798
Release the goddamn pictures!

59:31.520 --> 59:32.919
Say again?

59:33.000 --> 59:36.037
(Davis and Deslauriers
continue arguing)

59:36.120 --> 59:37.314
Hold on, stay on the line.

59:37.400 --> 59:40.551
Don't lecture me on intelligence,
okay, Ed? That is what I do!

59:40.680 --> 59:42.113
- Sir?
- What?

59:42.200 --> 59:44.430
White Hat, Black Hat.
Fox got the pictures.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.296
They want what we have,
or they're gonna release them.

59:46.320 --> 59:47.514
Repeat that. Say that again.

59:47.600 --> 59:49.680
Fox is gonna release the pictures
in 20 minutes, sir.

59:49.720 --> 59:52.234
- With or without a consult.
- (hits door)

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.593
Deslauriers: Okay, I'm all about
inter-agency cooperation,

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.638
but when this is over,
I am gonna hunt down the piece of shit

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.951
that leaked those photos,
and I will fucking ruin him!

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.195
I'm not gonna let Fox News
run this investigation.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.233
We will release the pictures
as soon as the president is wheels up.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960
(door opens)

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.350
Deslauriers: We initially developed
one person of interest,

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.116
not knowing if that individual was working
alone or in concert with others.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.839
The FBI has developed
a second suspect.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.753
Today, we are enlisting
the public's help

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.308
in identifying these two suspects...

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.868
Reporter: Officials say
they've made the images public now

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.394
because they need help
in connecting the faces

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.600
of the potential suspects...

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.896
Reporter #2:...the other walking
just a short distance behind.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.514
(reporters chattering
in other languages)

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.999
Reporter #3: They believe that
someone out there would recognize

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.310
at least one,
perhaps both of these men,

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.520
and call in some vital information
to law enforcement.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.673
If you have any information at all,
please reach out to the FBI.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.235
(lighter clicks)

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.869
News anchor: Investigators tonight
are working to identify a young white man

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.190
spotted in surveillance video
from the Lord & Taylor.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.556
He was in the crowd
right before the second explosion.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.313
He was carrying a backpack,
talking on his cell phone,

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.550
wearing a black jacket,
gray hoodie,

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.074
and a white baseball cap
on backwards.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.936
News anchor #2: No one should
attempt to apprehend him

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.712
except law enforcement.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.631
Let me reiterate that caution.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.154
Do not take any action on your own.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.356
News anchor #3:
...identifying these two suspects.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.035
Somebody out there knows
these individuals as friends.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.016
News anchor #4: Federal law
enforcement authorities now believe

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.271
that a team of at least two men
carried out the bombings here.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.909
Not a lone wolf,
but two men described tonight

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.797
as armed and extremely dangerous.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.274
Deslauriers:
We initially developed one person...

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.616
News anchor #4: They are now
the world's most wanted men.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.871
Two men in their 20s caught on tape.
Suspect number one...

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.915
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.151
Get everything packed in the car.
It's time to leave.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.598
All right.
Can I have my gun now, though?

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.879
(speaking Arabic)

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.560
I just like...
I really want the gun now.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.392
Dzhokhar,
you will get your gun!

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.391
- When?
- Enough!

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.596
The pictures are blurry.
They're no good.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.439
No, the pictures are good.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.954
Pictures are really good.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.553
- Hey, man, where's Jahar at?
- I don't know.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.120
Did you guys see
the press conference?

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.000
One of the guys looks
exactly fuckin' like him.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.776
- Yo, that's what I fuckin' said.
- No way. Everybody's fuckin' paranoid.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.776
- He looks exactly fuckin' like him.
- Dias: He texted me.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.438
He said to get some of his stuff.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.318
Go ahead, Dias.
I got a study group to get to.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.630
- Don't steal my shit!
- Fuck you, man.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.239
Fuck you!
Don't touch my shit.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.072
- Study group, dickhead.
- Fuckin' asshole.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.948
Gnarly, man, you can't drive
that thing on the beach.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.837
You're gonna get arrested again!

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.150
Relax, Bob.
You can't get arrested...

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.151
- This joint is kicked.
- (laughs)

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.639
It's all done.
It's cashed out.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.071
Where does Dzhokhar
keep his weed at?

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.589
Of course.
The coveted closet.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.597
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.676
Shit.
There's no weed in here.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.479
Dias:
What's that shit?

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.869
Don't fuckin' know.
Is that fuckin' fireworks?

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.191
What the fuck does he need
fireworks for?

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.874
- Hey, these are fuckin' BB's, man.
- What are you saying?

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.256
What are you fucking
talking about, man?

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.793
This is fuckin' bomb shit.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.216
Are you guys really that fuckin' high
you can't see this shit?

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.416
- What the fuck do we do?
- I don't know, man. You found it.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.998
Seriously? We found it.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.389
Quiet the fuck down
and put the stuff in the bag.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.075
We can't leave it here.
Bag it up, man!

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.798
What the fuck you think
I'm doin', man?

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.440
News anchor: We're still waiting
to hear more about suspects.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.536
News anchor #2: With pictures
being available to the public,

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.596
the FBI has yet to receive any...

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.559
News anchor #3: We now await
one key lead, the names of these men.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.736
- Kara: Is it hot? Yeah.
- It's fucking hot.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.520
- So you broke a finger cheerleading?
- Yeah.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.456
I did a backflip and came down
on my hand like that.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.896
Were you before, like, people throw you
up really high, and then you come...

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.956
Yeah, I fell.
I got a concussion my senior year.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.040
And I tried to get up and I tried to walk,
and my entire left body was numb.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.394
Like, I couldn't walk.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.153
I feel like I'd be really
lonely if I was here.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.959
- Like, you're alone, right?
- Yeah, it's okay.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.669
In the beginning,
like three years ago, it was harder.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.878
Now, it's like, you make new friends
and you find new people.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.512
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.709
(speaking Arabic)

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.432
You wanted a gun.
Now you need a gun.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.431
Unless you know someone
that has one.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.556
Dispatcher on radio:
242, what's your status?

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.911
I'm in the Quad, tucked next to
the Koch building for the next 45.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.759
Got my eyes
on Main Street and Vasser.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.638
After that,
I got dinner break for 30.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.519
Can I do it?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.309
Dispatcher:
Denver 544. Koch is quiet.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.880
We're gonna rotate you
over to Kresge.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.676
Collier:
Yeah, it is very dry out here.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.957
So if you want me to rotate,
I'm absolutely ready.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.519
Copy that.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.515
(groans)

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.794
Grab the gun, Dzhokhar!

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.233
(Collier groaning)

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.196
No, no! No, no, no!

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.998
- Come on!
- He won't fucking let go!

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120
Fuck you!

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.997
(struggling)

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.196
- Why won't you let go?
- Watch out!

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520
No!

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.832
- Let's go!
- What now, motherfucker?

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040
Man: Hey!

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.910
Dzhokhar: Come on,
you fuckin' piece of shit!

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.353
Let's go! Come on!

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.072
Dispatcher:
All units. All units.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.594
This is a Commonwealth-wide
all-points bulletin.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.796
We have a report
of an officer shot at MIT.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.599
Requesting available units
for search for suspects.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.875
Witnesses report
two men fleeing the scene.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.315
Caucasian, medium build,
dark clothing.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.356
Suspects are armed.
Use caution.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.834
A team, we have no suspect
information at this time.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.757
Nothing.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.109
Sorry to bother, uh,
can you help me real quick?

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.080
Sorry.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.188
Yeah, I just want you to...

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.355
- Hey, don't...
- Do not move.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.192
Do not fucking move.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.708
What is your name?

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.795
(stammering)
Manny.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.920
Yeah? Do you know about
the Marathon bombing, Manny?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.069
Yes, I know.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.194
- Do you know who did it?
- No.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.953
I did that.
You understand?

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.548
And I just killed a police officer.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.995
Bet you got a lot of money.
Give me your wallet.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.559
Let's go.
Give me your wallet.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:38.153
Yeah, yeah...
Just take everything.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.434
Just take it.
Take everything.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.152
Your name is not Manny.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.915
(stammers) No, it's...
My name's Dun Meng.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.389
It a-sound... it a-sound like Manny.
It sounds like Manny.

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:58.870
If you lie to me again,
wallahi, I will kill you.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.916
- I'm sorry.
- (knocking on window)

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.434
- Open the back!
- Do not fucking move.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.839
Open the back!

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.716
- Open the back.
- Okay, okay.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.395
Easy, buddy. Go ahead.
Good. Give me the keys.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.796
- Stay in the car.
- Okay.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:19.078
- I'll get the pressure cookers.
- (boys laughing in distance)

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.636
- Is that it?
- That's it. Get in the car.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.633
Shit.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.676
That's all right.
Easy, easy.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.471
- You can just take the car.
- (shushing)

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.755
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.229
Follow me.
All right. Let's go.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.151
Do not say anything.
Stay quiet.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.437
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.954
Get in the car.
You understand?

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.096
- You're gonna get in the car...
- Yes, yes.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.296
- ...and you're gonna be quiet.
- Yes.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320
All right? Let's go.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.755
Get in the car.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.988
Get in the car right now.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.308
- Jahar?
- Yeah?

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.799
- Watch him.
- All right.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.069
- Yo, does this have an iPod plug-in?
- Huh?

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.153
- Does your car have an iPod plug-in?
- No. No.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.674
You're sure? What about Bluetooth?
You got Bluetooth?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.471
I can plug my phone in
and play some stuff?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.719
(stammering)
Sorry, there's no Bluetooth.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.156
Do you have anyone
that cares about you?

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.230
Nobody care about me here.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.878
Then put on the seatbelt.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.236
Man: No one gets through,
you hear me?

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.630
EMT #2:
We need oxygen now.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.631
(sobs)
I don't know, Travis, it's bad.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.270
Yeah, it's Sean. I...

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.955
They tried to take his gun,
but he wouldn't give it up.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.234
They shot him. They...

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.673
EMT #3:
No pulse. He's gone.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.716
Dookie, take it easy.
Stay under the limit.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.109
Damn. This thing moves.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.873
Really?
Yo, can I drive it?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.070
- You wanna drive it?
- Yeah.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.639
- No way.
- Why?

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.109
Bro, I've never driven a Benz.
I really wanna drive a Benz.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.430
Jahar, you're not going to
drive this car.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.511
Get over it.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.511
(siren wailing)

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.234
You're going the wrong way, Officer.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.553
(sighs)

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.390
Tommy:
Hey! Turn around! Hey, you!

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.519
Where are you headin'? Home?

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.353
- We're goin' to his mother's house.
- All right, get off the street.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.336
Reporter on radio: The Boston Marathon
tragedy is being described

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.797
as the worst act of domestic terrorism
since the September 11 th attacks.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.440
However, unlike the attacks
on the World Trade Center...

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.630
- (slams radio)
- Fuck them!

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.950
You know that's bullshit,
right, Manny?

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.031
- Yes.
- 9/11...

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.155
Uh...

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.629
Muslims didn't
blow up those buildings.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.030
- The U.S. government did.
- Yes, I know.

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.394
- You know?
- I know.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.736
Are you saying yes
because you believe it,

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.120
or are you saying yes because
you don't want us to kill you?

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.232
Sorry, I don't know who did it.
9/11...

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.200
Dzhokhar:
Yo, you need to educate yourself, dog.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.896
For real, that's the problem
with this country.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.275
No one knows what goes down.
America is fake as fuck.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.473
The government did all that shit.
The government.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.279
To make Americans
hate real Muslims.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.119
A lot of people who say
they were at 9/11, they're all actors.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.296
- Meng: I didn't know that.
- Well, now you know.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.550
Of course you didn't.
You're conditioned by the media.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.640
Yeah.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.909
Take your ATM card.
Give it to Jahar.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.514
What is your PIN number?

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.397
Your PIN number!
I need your PIN number.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.029
- What is your PIN number?
- 6-2-2-8.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.872
- Did you get that?
- What?

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.396
- 6...
- 6-2-2-8.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.313
(mimicking Meng)
6-2-2-8. Okay.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.150
Okay, Jahar, get as much
money as you can, okay?

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.992
- Well, I look wack as fuck.
- Jahar!

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.116
- Get as much money as you can.
- All right.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.310
Dzhokhar:
Times Square is...

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.676
42nd Street and Broadway...

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.239
Boom!

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.233
Automated voice:
Time to New York, 3 hours, 42 minutes.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.915
Please, can I just leave
and you can take the car?

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.960
- You want to leave?
- You can just...

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.468
You want to leave the car?
Are you asking me to leave the car?

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.800
- Fuck that.
- Meng: No, no, no.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.911
I leave the car, you take the car.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.256
No, you're not going anywhere.
You're gonna stay right there.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.111
Meng: I won't...
I won't call the police.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.951
Please, I have a family in China.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.472
I have a mama,
I have a daddy.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.151
I have a brother.
(whimpers)

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.149
I have...

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.437
Please?
I don't call anyone.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.398
Just let me go.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.268
Shut the fuck up.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.239
Fill up the tank.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.194
(knocks on window)

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.391
The pump's busted.
It's cash only.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.833
- Get something to eat, too.
- All right. Want somethin' to eat?

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.920
No.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.070
- Tamerlan: You're not hungry?
- No, that's okay.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.151
Dzhokhar:
I'll get him something.

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.517
Tamerlan:
Gonna be a long ride.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.514
(grunting)

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.556
- Fuck you!
- Fuck!

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.433
(speaking Arabic)

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.958
Dzhokhar:
What the fuck happened?

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.277
Call the police!
Call police, please!

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.918
- What happened?
- Please call!

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.136
Two people,
they kidnapped me.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.656
They said they're
the Marathon bombers...

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.432
Call the police!

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.872
Operator: 9-1-1 recorded line.
What's the nature of your emergency?

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.996
I am in Mobil gas station.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.197
I have one claiming
someone wants to shoot him.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.918
And he stay inside,
and he won't leave.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Can I speak with him?

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.753
Hello? Please help me!
Please help me!

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.957
Two people, they came to my car,
and they have guns.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.720
Dispatcher:
All units, possible carjacking.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.432
At least two males,
white, mid-twenties

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.080
at the Mobil station
off Memorial and River Street.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.912
(tires screeching)

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.755
Witness is an Asian male,
name unclear.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.831
Emergency operator had trouble
understanding him.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.399
Requesting units to investigate.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.472
Officer:
Patrol Unit 488 responding.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.236
I don't understand.
Why are we doing this?

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.753
Why are we doing this?

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.149
Why do I have to take this car?
This car's so much better!

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.440
Because they're gonna
be looking for us now in this one.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.096
No, but then why don't
we just get another car?

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.336
We'll just get, like, a better car.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.616
- We can jack a Lambo...
- Get the fucking bombs.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.016
- ...or something actually working.
- Get the fucking bombs, all right?

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.256
Just listen to me for a second!

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.396
If we get another car,
like, an actual car...

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.948
Listen to me, Tamerlan, please!
Listen to me!

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.156
Stop treating me like a fucking baby!
Listen to me!

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.674
You fucking distracted me!
You distracted me.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.216
That's why he got away.
Do you understand that?

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.296
What? This is not my fault!
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.550
This is your fault!
You were up front with him!

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.136
I was in the back the whole time, and I
went to get snacks, you piece of shit.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.232
Don't fucking accuse me!
Don't fucking accuse me!

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.096
Fucking be quiet right now.
Do you understand?

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.599
- Dzhokhar...
- Okay. Okay.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.336
- You be fucking quiet right now.
- All right, all right.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.736
- Or I'll fucking kill you myself!
- All right, all right.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.716
- Do you understand me, Jahar?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.856
I'll fucking shoot you myself!

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.520
- All right. Yeah.
- Do you understand me?

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.679
You distracted me.
That's how he got away.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.536
You're gonna do as I say and grab the
fucking bombs and put them in the trunk.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.915
- All right.
- And do as I fucking say, you understand?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.194
- Yeah.
- Right now.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.836
You fucking get in the car!

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.876
I'll find somewhere
to ditch the Mercedes.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.029
And you will follow me.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.712
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.149
(brakes screech)

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.432
- Hey, Phil, what's up?
- He's over here, Sarge.

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.616
- Tommy: Hey. What's goin' on?
- Phil: I can't get a word out of him.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.856
Let me talk to him for a second.
Sir, how are you? You okay?

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.598
Two people, they take my car.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.557
They take my car over there in the...

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.952
They drive me around for, like,
an hour, and they say they put a...

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.554
- Wait, what did you say?
- These people, they tell me

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.074
they gonna do the explosion
in New York.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.195
What?

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.714
They're the Marathon race bombers.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.439
Wait, no, no, calm down.
Just calm down for a second.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.078
Did you just say
"Marathon bombers"?

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.628
They said to you that they were
the Marathon bombers?

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.640
Yes, they told me.
They are the Marathon bombers!

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.989
Listen to me.
What kind of car do you drive?

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.635
It's my black Mercedes SUV.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.756
That car has a GPS.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.472
The tracking number
is 3422347.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.429
- Well, how do you know that number?
- I just remember.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.760
Please, they're very dangerous.
You have to catch them.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.176
You know what? It took a lot of balls
to escape like you did.

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.236
Hey, you're a very brave guy.
Do you hear me?

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.959
Go catch those motherfuckers!

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.799
(muttering)

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.070
Fuck! Fuck!
Wasn't my fucking fault!

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.633
Wasn't my fucking fault!

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.632
Look, you fucking fuck!

All right, Chris,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.911
Just for a change of pace.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.549
Sarge, it's Joey.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.720
Think I got eyes on
that Mercedes called in earlier.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.799
I'm gonna flip around
and follow him.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.196
Reynolds: He stopped.
He's on Laurel off Dexter.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.799
Hold up, Reynolds.
I'm comin' in behind you.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.670
Light 'em up whenever you're ready.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
(seat belt clicks)

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.957

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.952

- Yeah, I'm all right!

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.999
Drop your weapon
and come out...

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.593
- (gunfire)
- Jesus!

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.312

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.400
Tamerlan:

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.680

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.033

How many clips you got?

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.431
- This is my last one.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.478

Whoa! Miguel!
Miguel, it's me, Joey!

Holy shit, dude!
Are you all right?

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.976
I'm all right.
Push onto Laurel.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.416
And cover my ass.
I'll get behind you.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.759
- Let's go!
- Go slow.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.033
Okay, go, go!

We got units comin' in!

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.309
This is it, Jahar.

This is Delta 984 in pursuit

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.079

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.393

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.274
I gotta fucking quit smoking.

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.188
He's gone.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.136
- Doctor: Get outta here!
- Excuse me, step back.

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.958

Doctor: Good Lord.

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.680

Lived in Cambridge with his wife

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.636
Get HRT, S.O.G., bomb techs over there

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.711
Give me a hard perimeter.
Evacuate a block.

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.000

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.511
- Black Hat, Tamerlan Tsarnaev?

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.956
- We might have known this guy.
- Known him how?

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.996
He popped up
on a Guardian watch list.

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.275
All right, get me the list.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.280
(mouthing)

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.793
Right fucking here!

News anchor:
During the pursuit, one of the suspects

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.999
was critically injured,
transported to hospital,

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.150
where he was pronounced dead.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.071
Now, here's where we stand.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.277
Extensive manhunt in Watertown...

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.376

who came in contact with the suspects

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.915
told police that the brothers discussed
New York City as their next destination.

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.470
You heard?
We got positive ID on Black Hat.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.993
Yes, Tsarnaev.
We heard. Black Hat.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.314
What about White Hat?

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.595
How sure are we that
he's still within the perimeter?

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.176
It's hard to be sure
in the dark like this.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.758
My guys are runnin' on fumes.

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.278
- Two sheds.
- Colonel: We're tracking reports.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.828
A taxi picked up a guy
matching White Hat's description

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.433
from Watertown to South Station.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.158
Could be he's on his way
to New York.

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:49.919
Okay.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.309

Every inch of this city
is getting searched.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.636
Davis: You positive
you wanna do this, Governor?

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.358
That's close to martial law.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.874
T ell your people to be judicious
with the door kicking.

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.030
We got laws.
People still have rights.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:22.511
Gov. Patrick: This murderer is
not causing any more harm to this city.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.033
We're shuttin' it down.

No, it's okay. It's cool.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.176
You're supposed to be

- Yeah, I know.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.750

Tech: Basically he's got
home videos, boxing, wrestling.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.033
Stuff we see all the time.

And porn.
A lot of fucking porn.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.496
This guy watched more porn
than Bin Laden.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.114
Okay, Washington is flying up
a team to interview the wife.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.456

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.120

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.796
Robel: Dickhead.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.976
You're missing class
for an ass-whuppin'.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.800
- Wide open, man.
- I'm just letting you know.

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.035
I don't wanna go
to Crystal's stupid party.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.839

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:18.835

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.672

Repeat, we do not have White Hat.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.590
No. Negative. Right.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.752
We're gettin' tips from kids sayin'
they buy their pot from White Hat.

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.876
Apparently,
he's the biggest dealer at U Mass.

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.416
Commish, they just called
from Black Falcon.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.919
They got the wife.

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.159
Lisa: Not what you were
expecting, huh, Commish?

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:47.832
Davis: It never is.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.914
Man: S.A.C. DesLauriers?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.551
- I'm looking for S.A.C. DesLauriers.
- Rick DesLauriers.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.074
Hi, I'm Mike Thomas.
May I have a word with you?

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.394
We're gonna handle
the interview from here.

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.876
- Have any of you spoken to her yet?
- Not yet.

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.428
- This is everything we have on her.
- We're good. We're good.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.710
Thank you, gentlemen.
We will take it from here.

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:41.152
Assalam-alaikum.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.115
Assalam-alaikum.

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.115
You disrespect the Prophet?

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.438
Walaikum-assalam.

01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.428
Katherine,
are there more bombs?

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:08.114
My name is Veronica.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.192
I was born in a tent
with three walls

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.352
that said UNICEF on the sides

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.716
to a mother who could not
write her own name.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.789
You were born in a room
full of flowers and balloons.

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:26.350
Your mother is a nurse.
She calls you Katie.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.228
- You know nothing about me.
- Your best friend, Gina Crawford,

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.517
works at a Starbucks in Cambridge

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.955
where you tried
to convert her to Islam

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:39.316
- between skinny caramel macchiatos.
- You know nothing.

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.472
Are there more bombs?

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.710
More bombers?

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.349
You sent Gina a text
right after the bombing

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.557
that said,
"A lot more people are killed

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:55.110
every day in Syria
and other places.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.033
Innocent people."

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.588
Did you see the footage
on television?

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:07.194
We found explosive residue
from the bombs in your apartment.

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.719
On your kitchen table.
In your kitchen sink.

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.029
The kitchen where you made
breakfast for your daughter.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:19.269
Are there more bombs?

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.034
You met Tamerlan in a bar
your sophomore year

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.509
- at Suffolk University.
- I want a lawyer.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.591
Tell me, Katie,

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.435
what are the rewards
for the wife of a mujahid?

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.636
If one's husband
becomes shahid,

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.439
what are the gifts
bestowed upon his wife?

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.268
(scoffs)

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.749
Your mind is too small
to understand any of this.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.193
- (sternly) Are there more bombs?
- I want a lawyer.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:51.872
- No.
- No?

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.438
- No, what?
- No.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:57.757
- I have rights.
- You ain't got shit, sweetheart.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.357
- Are there more bombs?
- Am I under arrest?

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.479
- Are there more bombs?
- No? Then you can't keep me.

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.195
Sit!

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:16.472
Who the fuck are these guys?

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.076
Are there more bombs?

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.310
You're crazy!
You're bat-shit crazy, you know that?

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.551
You are out of your mind.
Your fucking mind.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.351
Katie...

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.159
your husband is gone.

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:38.631
Forever.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:47.991
Sweetheart,
you are now a widow.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.111
And have deserted your daughter,

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.829
who will grow up knowing
her father was a monster.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.356
Stop. Stop!

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:07.838
He didn't even kiss you
before he left...

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:09.911
did he?

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:15.598
Katie, for the sake
of your daughter...

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.478
are there any more bombs?

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:23.600
(sniffles)

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:28.152
For a Muslim woman,

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.590
marriage is a lilting dance
of duality...

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.070
strength and submission.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.592
Beautiful, selfless,

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.797
rapturous love of two masters,

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.150
the carnal and the divine.

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:50.030
The life a Muslim woman lives

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.031
is a dangerous
and difficult one.

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:54.714
If she does not
submit to her husband,

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.234
there is a spot reserved
for her in Hell.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.911
Yes.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.309
My husband kissed me
before he left,

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.874
and he will kiss me again
when I see him in Heaven.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.992
And you can't prove anything.

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.520
(speaks Arabic)

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.676
Excuse me.

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:26.839
- What do you think?
- I think she knew.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.559
But you're never gonna prove it.

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.428
If there are more bombs out there,
she'll never tell us.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.272
How could a mother do that
to her daughter?

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.349
Good luck, huh.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.198
(sirens wailing)

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.296
Gov. Patrick: Please tell me
you have something for us

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:57.471
because we're losing daylight
and I have some decisions to make.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:58.913
She's not talking.

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:03.832
Mr. Governor,
we ran a Guardian search.

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:07.111
Black Hat was watchlisted.

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.589
He was right there all along,
and we missed him.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.229
All these guys.
All these leads.

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.790
You see a Chechen
who's not AI-Qaeda,

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.952
- not even Middle Eastern...
- Come on, Rick. Fuck that.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.713
We all had access
to the same database.

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.031
I mean, who was lookin' for
some narcissistic little princess?

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.193
Some whiny little bitch who threw
a tantrum because he lost a fight.

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:33.312
Everybody found out
he beat up his girlfriend?

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.676
He's no martyr.
He's a fucking coward.

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.599
We covered Barker Street.

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.838
We got Washburn...

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.676
You think this shit is preventable?

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.190
- "Preventable"?
- Yeah.

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.272
Seven years ago...

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:04.078
on March 11th...

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.038
went to the doctor.

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:10.475
Said we couldn't have any kids.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.551
Carol couldn't have any babies.

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:14.119
Jesus, Tommy.
I didn't know that.

01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.555
I remember after,
right after, we went home,

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:21.191
parked the car in the driveway,
and you don't make this kinda stuff up,

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.716
right there,
the Mulaney kids.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.268
Three little girls out there
playin' hopscotch.

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.353
Little five-year-old girls.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.016
I don't know, we just sat there
dead quiet watchin' 'em play.

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.474
- It was like we were in a trance.
- Jesus.

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:42.354
Sound that Carol made,
it wasn't cryin'.

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:43.759
It was deeper.

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.310
No, cryin' does not describe
that kinda sound.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:51.154
I looked into her eyes,
and it wasn't pain.

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.350
More like war.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.998
Like a war between good and evil
right there in her eyes.

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:06.518
Like the devil attacked,
and God was inside of her fightin' back.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.715
We got your back.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.515
I just held her.

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.670
What could I do? You know?

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.348
That's all I saw today.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.278
Good versus evil,
love versus hate.

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.678
The devil hits you like that,

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.990
there's only one weapon
you have to fight back with.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.555
It's love.

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.152
That's the only thing he can't touch.

01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.678
What are we gonna do?
We hunt 'em down.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.711
Catch them, kill them, all that?

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.109
Still gonna get us.

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.998
No way it can ever be
entirely preventable.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.831
(door opens)

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.631
(laughing)

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.870
Wrap our arms around each other.

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.272
Let love power us, feed us.

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.193
I don't think there's any way
that they could ever win.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.428
I always knew there was
a thing of beauty

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.114
buried deep in the holy soul
of Tommy Saunders.

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.677
Four days ago,

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.069
you and I stood over the body
of a dead kid.

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.797
We can't go back to
all those families with nothin'.

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.871
We owe 'em better.

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.715
Bet I'll run the Marathon before you.

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:07.318
It's "befo' you."

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.193
Before you.

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.632
"Befo' you."
The "R" is silent.

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.308
- Befo' you.
- (laughs)

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.157
Man:
Honey, I'm gonna have a smoke.

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:31.390
- Just gonna be right here, okay?
- No, no, come on.

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.200
Come on, get your foot in.
Get your foot in.

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.759
The roller's outta the hull.

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.671
- It's okay.
- Came loose from the cover.

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:38.096
- It's gonna ruin the hull.
- Come on.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.336
It'll just take me
one second, okay?

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.715
- I'm just gonna run out and fix it.
- They'll shoot you!

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.631
You're not allowed
to be out there!

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:06.358
Lisa:
Sir! I just got a call.

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.360
Someone thinks they saw someone
suspicious hide in a boat down the street.

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.436
- In a boat?
- A boat.

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.999
Billy: Hey, Tommy!

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:21.589
- What you got? What's up?
- (whispers) He's in the boat.

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.598
- What?
- He's in the boat.

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.760
There's someone in my boat.

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.216
There's someone in your boat?
Where's the boat?

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.360
My boat's right around back.

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:29.520
It's got little rollers that
go underneath the cover,

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.536
- and the rollers came off.
- Go ahead, call it in.

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.788
Billy:
This is Yankee T-3.

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:36.111
We have a possible individual
in a boat at 67 Franklin.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.752
- Hey, you got a basement?
- Yes.

01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:41.559
Go in the house, get your family
in the basement, do not move.

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:04.671
Billy:
Easy, Tommy. Easy.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.271
- (mouthing)
- (mouthing)

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:35.155
- (siren wailing)
- Fuck! Fuck!

01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:36.280
- Jesus.
- What do you got?

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.920
- Shut them the fuck up!
- What the fuck?

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.656
(whispering) It's him. He's in there.
He's in the fuckin' boat.

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:41.176
It could be rigged
to fuckin' blow! Let's go!

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.776
- We're gonna get him!
- Guys, guys, get back.

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.656
- Get back in your vehicles.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:46.875
Secure the street!
Clear these fuckin' houses!

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.473
This is Yankee T-3.

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.632
We need an EOD
and a tac team at 67 Franklin.

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:53.760
We got a possible suspect
in the backyard in a boat.

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.835
He may have a bomb.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:57.160
Tommy: Stand down
and let the tactical unit do their job.

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.915
Hey! Hey! You gettin' me?
What frequency are you on?

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.792
- Nah, I don't hear ya.
- Tommy: What?

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.376
The whole state's
fuckin' here, Tommy.

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.856
And everyone's
on a different frequency.

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.836
Guys, radio discipline, please!

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:08.797
Stay off the air.
Hold back, please.

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.476
(man speaking
indistinctly over radio)

01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.389
(rustling)

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.033
- He's moving!
- SWAT: Movement!

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.075
Billy: Hold your fire!

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.315
Hold your fire!

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.278
Jesus Christ!

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:34.191
Guys, lower your weapons.
Everyone.

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.109
Shit.

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.840
I'll tell ya,
that boat ain't gonna float.

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.456
News anchor:
If you're just tuning in right now,

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.800
there has been what appears to be

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:44.549
a major development in what
has been a 19-hour search

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:46.471
for a 19-year-old
bombing suspect

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:47.993
for the Marathon bombing.

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:50.913
And it has turned into
just absolute mayhem.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.036
(sighs)
It's time to end this.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.313
All state and local units
stand down immediately.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.994
FBI Hostage Rescue
will be taking over.

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.776
FBI operative:
All right, let's get strikin'.

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.392
The Virginian:
Victor 1-1, Victor 2-4,

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.118
let's move everybody
into position.

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.349
We 're clear out here.

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.395
(helicopter hovering)

01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.153
- Who the fuck are you?
- Ma'am, we're with the FBI.

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.120
You can go ahead and step down now.
We got this.

01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.310
The FBI? Boston FBI?

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.668
No, ma'am.
We're from Quantico.

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.637
Well, I'm from Framingham,
Massachusetts,

01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.518
and this is my spot,
and I ain't fuckin' leaving.

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.231
Glad to have you with us, ma'am.

01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:00.517
Victor 4-4, Victor 1-1,
I got the boat.

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:01.828
We have the boat.

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:03.399
Baseline green.
We got the boat.

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:09.920
The Virginian:
Victor 1-1, Victor 2-8,

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.718
run a few rounds
of 40 Mike bang in there,

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.440
try to shake this fellow up
a little bit.

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.496
Excuse me, ma'am.
This is about to get pretty loud.

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.192
I don't give a fuck!

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.195
(dog barking)

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.035
Negotiator:
Come on out!

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.592
Come on, Dzhokhar!
Let's go!

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.830
Man: Okay, we have movement.
We have movement.

01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:55.512
Arm's moving.

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.996
Officer:
Victor 3-6. One in custody.

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.435
- Yeah!
- (all cheering)

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.670
News anchor: Police took 19-year-old
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev into custody.

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.816
News anchor #2: Dangerous,
as we saw. They got him alive.

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.160
There is a great sense of relief.

01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:57.031
(news anchors speaking
in other languages)

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.518
News anchor:
This is something.

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.034
A crowd celebrating the news of

01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:07.515
the arrest of suspect number two

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.160
in the Boston Marathon bombing.

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.991
(crowd chanting)
Let's go, Boston!

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:21.236
We have to thank, definitely,
the public for the tips

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:24.073
and the help and the information
that we've gotten from them...

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.795
Thank you. You're the best
to ever wear that uniform.

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:23.753
(cheering)

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.755
David Ortiz:
All right, Boston!

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:30.718
This jersey that we wear today,

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:33.314
it doesn't say "Red Sox."

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:36.073
- It say "Boston."
- (cheering)

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.356
We wanna thank you,
Mayor Menino...

01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.633
Governor Patrick...

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.630
the whole police department...

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:53.638
for the great job
that they did this past week.

01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:03.390
This is our fuckin' city.

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:11.353
And nobody gonna
dictate our freedom.

01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:13.559
Stay strong!

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:08.556
Patrick: Two people took many days
and weeks to plan out hate.

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:12.679
But love responded
in an instant.

02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:19.592
The bombs went off
and wreaked incredible havoc,

02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:21.238
death, and destruction.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:24.471
But in that immediate
instant afterward,

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:26.755
people ran toward us.

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:29.636
I first heard the term
"Boston Strong"

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:31.517
about two days
into the investigation.

02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:34.197
And for me,
it was emblematic of

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:37.397
how tough the city
and its residents can be.

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:42.400
Jeff Pugliese: I'm a true patriot.
I really do believe in America.

02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:46.875
And I think Boston Strong,
it just shows that

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:49.076
we're gonna stand up
and defend ourselves.

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:52.232
We're not gonna take it
and be beaten down.

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:53.992
We're not gonna bother you,

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.992
but don't come at us because
we're gonna come back at ya.

02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:59.594
When's the last time
you saw crowds of people

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:01.238
cheering the police on like that?

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.675
That brought tears to my eyes.
It really did.

02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:06.877
When we captured him,
it was the best feeling in the world.

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:10.669
As a police officer, I don't ever
remember having a better feeling.

02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:12.876
It's almost like
we just won the war.

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.552
In the weeks after the bombings,

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.790
when I had the opportunity
to visit many of the most

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.633
severely injured Boston
Marathon bombing survivors,

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.713
I was absolutely amazed
by the strength and resiliency

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:27.837
of the human spirit
exhibited in these individuals.

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:29.876
It was absolutely amazing.

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:35.837
Gov. Patrick:
I think that day on Boylston Street,

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.718
the bombers took lives and limbs...

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.437
they took some of
our sense of security,

02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:48.195
but they took a lot less
than they intended.

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.756
And they gave us back some
things they didn't intend us.

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:55.992
They gave us a stronger sense
of community, of common cause.

02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.396
And I think we've seen that
in other examples around the world.

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:03.991
Patrick: When we see the news
that another attack has happened,

02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:07.356
in Brussels, Islamabad, Nice,

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.193
Orlando, San Bernardino, Paris...

02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:13.829
I think it's important we think about
these people around the world

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:17.913
not as victims of violence,
but ambassadors for peace.

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:21.914
(Meng speaking)

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.791
You know, I have a tremendous
amount of optimism

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:38.553
and hope for the future.

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.870
Going forward with Leo,

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:44.714
I hope that he views the world
with open eyes,

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:48.793
lots of questions,
and a sense of humor.

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.312
This has been the absolute worst
and lowest time in our lives,

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.197
as well as the best.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:58.113
As bizarre as that is to say,

02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:00.111
and not that I don't miss my legs,

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:01.315
I miss them every day,

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:04.039
but after being the recipients

02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:07.396
of such incredible care
and kindness,

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.392
the very least I can do
is get out of bed and try again.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:14.393
And try to make this world
a little bit better for somebody else.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.911
Patrick:
About two years after the bombing,

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.436
I got a running leg
and started to practice with it.

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.229
But I still didn't know
I could get to the finish line

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:28.676
until we took the turn
onto Boylston.

02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:31.989
That was the hardest stretch
of the race

02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:35.231
because it was
running past the spot

02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.949
where a bomb had gone off
and changed our lives,

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:41.838
took the lives of three others.

02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:46.037
(announcements over P.A.)

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.235
(cheering)

02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.948
Race announcer:
And here comes Patrick Downes.

02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.511
Patrick Downes,
who lost a leg in 2013,

02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:59.989
met by his wife,
Jessica Kensky.

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:09.357
There are great moments.
There are inspiring moments.

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:13.440
There are moments
to savor and treasure.

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.076
(music playing)

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.791
(music playing)

02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:33.030
