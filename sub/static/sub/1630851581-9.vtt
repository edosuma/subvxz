Yes! I am the bomb!

00:55.847 --> 00:58.684
And the three‐pointer
king is...

00:58.684 --> 01:00.936
‐ Andy!
‐ Drake!

01:00.936 --> 01:03.897
MIKE: 19 to 20 with 23 seconds
left on the clock!

01:03.897 --> 01:05.482
You guys can still win!

01:14.533 --> 01:15.993
Huh? Huh?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.416
Andy, I'm open!

01:23.667 --> 01:25.877
All hail the three‐point king!

01:32.426 --> 01:33.969
No!

01:36.930 --> 01:40.350
Ha, ha! Looks like
your reign's over, Your Majesty!

01:40.350 --> 01:42.894
Face it, you're basic, Baker!

01:42.894 --> 01:45.397
Ha, ha! Basic Baker!

01:46.148 --> 01:48.483
Here's your ball,
three‐points king!

01:48.483 --> 01:49.860
What just happened?

01:52.237 --> 01:55.949
I may not be a b‐ball pro
like you, but I was wide open!

01:55.949 --> 01:58.744
‐ Why didn't you pass to me?
‐ It's all good!

01:58.744 --> 02:01.747
On the bright side,
a total fail is just a reminder

02:01.747 --> 02:05.125
‐ to stay on top of your game!
‐ I missed a three‐pointer?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.877
Three‐pointers are what I do!

02:13.925 --> 02:16.428
Aaah! There's gotta be
some explanation!

02:16.428 --> 02:20.641
Maybe the wind... or the light!
I blame the sun!

02:22.267 --> 02:24.895
Just wait
till next Saturday's game.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.564
All that cheering will
help you get your mojo back!

02:38.575 --> 02:40.077
Phew!

02:45.666 --> 02:47.417
Aaah!

02:51.797 --> 02:54.132
(Chuckle)

03:09.856 --> 03:12.567
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

03:14.736 --> 03:16.196
(Sound of panic)

03:17.489 --> 03:18.573
Aaah!

03:23.829 --> 03:25.288
Aaah!

03:34.005 --> 03:35.799
(Screaming continues)

03:36.716 --> 03:39.261
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but... were those ghosts?

03:40.512 --> 03:43.098
Aw! And they're the cutest,
itty‐bitty ghosts

03:43.515 --> 03:45.392
I ever did see!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.019
See? That's it!

03:48.311 --> 03:50.772
Maybe I missed that basket
'cause of my eyesight.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.566
Anyone know a good eye doctor?

03:52.566 --> 03:54.776
I think we've got
bigger problems here.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.486
Huh? Oh, yeah, ghosts.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.239
Aaah!

04:05.162 --> 04:07.205
Let's go, Ghost Force!

04:08.457 --> 04:10.792
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

04:16.173 --> 04:17.466
Fury!

04:18.592 --> 04:20.343
Krush!

04:21.136 --> 04:22.512
Myst!

04:25.891 --> 04:27.184
Ghost Force!

04:33.732 --> 04:35.150
(Screaming)

04:35.901 --> 04:37.110
(Laughter)

04:39.821 --> 04:42.199
We must stop 'em before
they go into booster mode

04:42.199 --> 04:44.117
and become too cute to handle!

04:44.117 --> 04:45.827
Now's your chance.

04:46.870 --> 04:50.123
‐ Hit 'em with a three‐pointer!
‐ A three‐pointer? Oh... yeah...

04:50.874 --> 04:52.125
(Gulps)

04:53.126 --> 04:55.003
Flexy blast!

04:58.256 --> 05:01.426
‐ (Mocking laughter)
‐ Not even one of them?

05:03.261 --> 05:05.764
What is going on with me today?

05:05.764 --> 05:08.183
If they split up,
it'll be three times the work!

05:10.060 --> 05:11.770
‐ Aaah!
‐ Miaow.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.104
Fractal trap!

05:14.898 --> 05:16.608
Gotcha!

05:27.035 --> 05:28.662
‐ (Gasps)
‐ Huh?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.414
Flexy blast!

05:33.124 --> 05:34.459
You gotta be kidding me!

05:35.961 --> 05:37.045
(Chuckles)

05:39.214 --> 05:41.258
And that is how it's done.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.634
Fury, get a Boocap!

05:45.595 --> 05:48.223
Too late! They have enough
Boo energy to boost!

05:53.812 --> 05:54.479
Aaah!

05:56.731 --> 05:58.608
Miaow!

05:58.942 --> 06:03.113
‐ So, still think it's cute?
‐ Yep. Evil, but mostly cute.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.699
Sometimes
I really don't get you!

06:16.668 --> 06:17.586
Heads up, Fury!

06:23.341 --> 06:26.094
Huh? Argh! Whoa!

06:29.139 --> 06:30.765
For reals?

06:30.765 --> 06:33.810
This head sucks up Boo energy!

06:33.810 --> 06:38.231
A different power for each head?
That's boo‐tastic!

06:38.231 --> 06:39.941
Hope we'll be able
to tame it one day!

06:43.945 --> 06:47.115
‐ Ugh!
‐ Boo!

06:47.115 --> 06:48.742
Fury, use your FlexyBeam!

06:52.454 --> 06:55.457
‐ Boo!
‐ Do cats play fetch?

07:07.510 --> 07:11.056
‐ Did Fury just flee?
‐ Yeah, he's lost his mojo!

07:11.056 --> 07:14.392
Who knew missing a shot could
lead to a personality crisis?

07:15.143 --> 07:17.145
Told you he shoulda
passed the ball to me.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.085
<i>‐ Catastrophe!</i>
‐ No kidding!

07:40.085 --> 07:43.505
No, Cat‐Astrophy
is the name of your ghost.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.966
‐ How about a fourth for backup?
‐ No can do.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.552
Your last mission left Glowboo
with a glitch or two.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.429
That's why
I was late to the party.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.140
Sorry, kids.
You're on your own on this one!

07:54.140 --> 07:55.975
We'll take one head each.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.020
Fury, aim at its paws
to immobilise it for starters!

07:59.020 --> 07:59.938
Aim at its paws?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.525
I'm not sure I can.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.902
Come on, you can do this!
Just focus!

08:11.366 --> 08:12.409
What's up with me?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.619
Aaah!

08:15.370 --> 08:16.955
Whoa!

08:21.751 --> 08:23.670
Whoa!

08:26.339 --> 08:27.632
Fractal Mace!

08:33.805 --> 08:35.932
Get yourself together, Fury!

08:35.932 --> 08:37.100
Aaah!

08:47.485 --> 08:49.821
Spectral Arrow!

08:51.906 --> 08:52.699
Aaah!

08:55.076 --> 08:56.202
Myst!

09:07.464 --> 09:09.591
My Boo energy won't last long.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.052
Fury,
you need to find your mojo!

09:12.052 --> 09:15.472
But keep missing! I can't
even score a single basket!

09:15.472 --> 09:17.807
Miaow!

09:18.141 --> 09:20.852
OK, losing the basketball game
is on you,

09:20.852 --> 09:23.063
but that's no reason
to give up now!

09:23.063 --> 09:26.858
‐ This is way bigger than that!
‐ Yeah, you're the fastest,

09:26.858 --> 09:28.526
cleverest, point guard I know!

09:28.526 --> 09:30.153
We need you, Fury.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.529
We've gotta fight together

09:31.529 --> 09:33.448
or we don't stand a chance.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.495
You're right. Missing a basket
won't throw me off my game.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.998
‐ That's my bro!
‐ Krush, fractal that up,

09:41.998 --> 09:43.666
would ya?

09:44.209 --> 09:46.044
Yeah!

09:48.338 --> 09:50.256
We'll do this together
like you said, Myst.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.219
All right, everyone ready?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.892
Miaow.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.978
(Battle cry)

10:04.395 --> 10:05.855
Flexy Power!

10:08.525 --> 10:10.151
Your turn for the assist!

10:18.368 --> 10:19.369
Nice work, sis!

10:22.122 --> 10:24.749
Uh‐oh... Aaah!

10:25.208 --> 10:26.292
Krush!

10:26.292 --> 10:28.169
Miaow.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.381
Roar!

10:35.260 --> 10:37.178
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

10:39.848 --> 10:41.015
Dragoyle!

11:00.493 --> 11:02.495
Miaow!

11:14.257 --> 11:16.342
(Cheering)

11:18.386 --> 11:19.929
Boo‐yah!

11:28.104 --> 11:31.900
19 to 20 with 23 seconds
left on the clock!

11:39.449 --> 11:41.492
Andy, I'm open!

11:51.878 --> 11:54.130
‐ We won!
‐ Oh, yeah!

11:55.048 --> 11:57.508
So, why'd you finally
pass the ball?

11:57.508 --> 12:00.053
Yeah, you could've sunk
that three‐pointer.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.640
True. But teamwork
makes it way more interesting.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.184
Plus, you had a clearer shot.

12:06.184 --> 12:10.772
And... you can still call me
the three‐point king now!

12:17.403 --> 12:18.446
Woof! Woof!

12:18.905 --> 12:21.074
OK, Asta,
the school fair is coming up,

12:21.074 --> 12:23.910
so your doggy dance moves
have to be up to scratch.

12:25.620 --> 12:29.290
Now wave your paws in the air
like you just don't care!

12:29.290 --> 12:30.250
Hmm? (Whimpers)

12:32.210 --> 12:32.877
Woof!

12:46.849 --> 12:49.852
OMG. Is that the first version
of the Ghost Gauntlet?

12:49.852 --> 12:53.815
So cool! And the Bisio Ghost
you used to nab Zip Zap?

12:53.815 --> 12:57.318
Oh, sweet! Oh! And this!
You were pretty handy

12:57.318 --> 13:00.738
‐ with that slingshot!
‐ She's totally fan‐girling out,

13:00.738 --> 13:04.242
just like you gogging at
my dad's basketball trophies.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.245
Or like you drooling over
a nerdy science experiment.

13:07.245 --> 13:10.415
Whoa! I've never seen this
little baby before!

13:10.415 --> 13:13.042
That's the Freonic
Ghost Blaster.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.254
Ah! Brings back
so many sweet memories.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.673
Memories of when
you were in the field?

13:18.673 --> 13:22.969
Yes! I was alone,
dealing with a viscous phantom.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.472
Good thing I had this doo‐hickey
to cool that ghost's heels

13:26.472 --> 13:30.893
‐ or I'd have been a goner.
‐ I so wanna be you one day!

13:32.061 --> 13:33.688
I can't believe
all these gadgets

13:33.688 --> 13:35.648
came from your imagination!

13:35.648 --> 13:37.108
I'd love to invent something.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.570
Good, 'cause I need help
completing my new prototype

13:40.570 --> 13:44.282
in the garage.
If you're up for it.

13:44.282 --> 13:47.368
Cool, meanwhile I'm gonna show
Glowboo a hobby

13:47.368 --> 13:50.455
‐ that will blow his circuits!
‐ But I just had them fixed.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.429
(Sniffing)

14:06.429 --> 14:08.598
Woof! Woof! Woof!

14:13.144 --> 14:14.687
Asta! Come here, boy!

14:16.522 --> 14:18.816
Asta?

14:18.816 --> 14:21.152
‐ Aah! What?
‐ Boo!

14:23.237 --> 14:24.655
Aaah!

14:24.655 --> 14:26.532
(Laughter)

14:31.621 --> 14:33.706
How'd I miss that turn?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.459
Oh, yeah, let's put
the pedal to the metal!

14:36.459 --> 14:38.795
‐ Hey, Andy, wanna train?
‐ Not a good time.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.297
‐ Wait till Ms Jones gets back.
‐ Come on,

14:41.297 --> 14:44.550
I really wanna try out
the Freonic Ghost Blaster now.

14:44.550 --> 14:48.262
I mean... I want to train
to be as strong as Ms Jones.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.807
Ms Jones was alone
when she used that thing.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.727
So maybe you ought to train
in the same conditions. Alone!

14:56.020 --> 14:58.564
‐ How about you, Glowboo?
‐ Negative.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.692
Andy is teaching me video games
to increase my efficiency.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.069
All right...

15:06.322 --> 15:09.617
How'd you get the boost?
These items are totally rigged!

15:13.454 --> 15:16.707
Come on, come on, come on!
I'm gonna beat Mike's top score!

15:18.543 --> 15:21.462
That is why you always wear
your seatbelt while driving.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.175
‐ (Honking)
‐ Boo!

15:26.175 --> 15:28.261
Aaah! Aaah!

15:28.261 --> 15:32.306
‐ (Laughs) Boo!
‐ Aaah!

15:32.306 --> 15:33.724
(Laughter)

15:34.517 --> 15:36.686
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

15:45.611 --> 15:47.446
(Laughter gets louder)

15:52.285 --> 15:53.035
(Deep laugh)

15:54.162 --> 15:56.664
Now that's
a Miss‐Jones‐level target!

15:56.664 --> 15:58.833
Spectral arrow!

16:03.254 --> 16:04.338
No!

16:10.303 --> 16:11.679
(Threatening laugh)

16:11.679 --> 16:13.472
Ghost‐Blaster time!

16:24.317 --> 16:27.528
(Cheering)

16:29.572 --> 16:32.867
‐ (Threatening laugh)
‐ Huh?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.537
Uh, that's
not supposed to happen.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.955
(Laughter)

16:41.500 --> 16:43.085
Aaah!

16:46.714 --> 16:48.090
Oh, no!

16:49.550 --> 16:51.093
What have I done?

16:53.596 --> 16:57.767
It's a video game, you don't
have to obey the speed limit!

16:57.767 --> 16:59.644
Law‐breaking
is against my protocol.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.686
Ugh!

17:01.479 --> 17:03.689
Hey, guys! You gotta
check out our prototype!

17:03.689 --> 17:08.694
Aaah! Oh! Jellystery! Oh, dear,
it's gone into Booster mode!

17:09.487 --> 17:11.405
Hold up.
Why is Liv already there?

17:12.907 --> 17:14.992
Come in, Liv!
What's your status?

17:14.992 --> 17:17.828
<i>Oh... I'm... ugh...</i>
<i>Oh, it's too strong!</i>

17:18.913 --> 17:20.957
BOTH: Let's go, Ghost Force!

17:21.666 --> 17:24.460
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

17:28.756 --> 17:30.049
Fury!

17:31.008 --> 17:32.301
Krush!

17:34.470 --> 17:35.638
Ghost Force!

17:38.432 --> 17:39.850
Ah! Uh‐oh!

17:40.601 --> 17:41.644
(Laughter)

17:45.982 --> 17:47.900
Myst! What were you thinking?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.027
I... I just wanted
to defeat him on my own.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.280
I mean, you told me Ms Jones ‐‐

17:52.280 --> 17:54.657
Wait. I thought you meant
a training sesh,

17:54.657 --> 17:57.034
not trying to un‐boost
a rampaging ghost!

17:57.910 --> 18:01.372
The Freonic Ghost Blaster
didn't break its shield at all.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.666
‐ It kinda made it stronger.
‐ Liv!

18:03.666 --> 18:06.877
You're telling me you took
my Freonic Ghost Blaster?

18:06.877 --> 18:10.006
I thought that since Jellystery
is a viscous ghost, it would ‐‐

18:10.006 --> 18:12.300
Not all Viscous are the same!

18:12.300 --> 18:15.094
And you are not trained
to handle that blaster!

18:15.094 --> 18:17.763
You're right.
I'll just evacuate everyone

18:17.763 --> 18:19.348
before I make things any worse.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.311
Myst!

18:25.479 --> 18:26.981
Krush, behind you!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.656
Ms Jones, got any bright ideas?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.825
Jellystery's made of jelly,
right?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.911
So, there's a good chance
its armour is also made of ‐‐

18:40.911 --> 18:44.498
What? I smell an
electro‐magnetic pulse coming!

18:44.498 --> 18:45.958
(Gasps) My prototype!

18:46.626 --> 18:50.212
‐ Ms Jones! Ms Jones!
‐ Come on, do something, Krush!

18:58.429 --> 19:02.141
With Myst absent,
our cohesion level is down 14%.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.392
Really? Ya think?

19:04.435 --> 19:06.145
Correction. 8%.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.611
MYST: Please hurry up!

19:21.911 --> 19:23.621
Glowboo! (Gasps)

19:36.759 --> 19:37.718
Aaah!

19:39.220 --> 19:41.806
Nice of you to pop in!
So what do we do now?

19:41.806 --> 19:44.684
Don't ask me. I'm not cut out
to be a superhero.

19:44.684 --> 19:48.646
What? Nuh‐uh, you are not
giving up just like that.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.648
Face it, Fury,
this is all my fault.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.235
OK, kinda true.
But think of it like basketball.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.946
I don't think this is the right
time to talk about ‐‐

19:56.946 --> 20:00.032
You screw up a layup, hustle
back to land a three‐pointer.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.786
Swish! But stay on defence
and you'll never get anywhere.

20:06.122 --> 20:09.291
Krush, you got any bright ideas
on how to stop this ghost?

20:09.291 --> 20:12.253
Maybe.
Cool jelly down and it hardens,

20:12.253 --> 20:13.921
but heat it up
and it disintegrates.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.549
Or, I dunno, gets even stronger?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.384
Whoa! Krush, chill.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.553
That all makes sense,
so let's try it out.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.805
If it bombs, we'll think again.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.975
All right!
That's the Myst I know and love!

20:25.975 --> 20:28.686
So, how're we gonna cook
this ghost's goose?

20:28.686 --> 20:33.023
Fry‐up, BBQ, or spicy tandoori?

20:33.023 --> 20:36.110
The Freonic Ghost Blaster!
Sure it freezes stuff,

20:36.110 --> 20:37.737
but could it heat things too?

20:38.028 --> 20:41.407
I just need to reverse the
degrees of thermal agitation.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.577
The blaster is in the street.
Find it and keep Jellystery

20:44.577 --> 20:48.956
‐ away from the crowd.
‐ Oh! <i>That</i> I understand!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.587
You're up.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.338
All right!

21:04.805 --> 21:07.141
<i>We're on the move. See</i>
<i>if you can immobilise the ghost</i>

21:07.850 --> 21:10.102
Looks like this grumpy ghost
needs a time‐out!

21:14.648 --> 21:15.441
Come on!

21:17.526 --> 21:18.903
Flexy Power!

21:26.786 --> 21:28.746
Yeah!

21:30.039 --> 21:31.081
Aaah!

21:32.625 --> 21:33.834
No!

21:33.834 --> 21:35.169
Aaah!

22:00.611 --> 22:01.529
It's over!

22:04.031 --> 22:05.491
Gromax!

22:40.276 --> 22:42.361
‐ Good dog!
‐ Next time,

22:42.361 --> 22:44.947
I promise to train with you
no matter what.

22:44.947 --> 22:48.826
Cool. And I promise not to yawn
whenever you talk basketball.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.953
As they say,
"Can't stand the heat,

22:50.953 --> 22:52.079
get outta the kitchen!"

22:52.079 --> 22:53.497
Boo‐yah!

22:57.293 --> 23:00.963
Liv? Mike? Andy? Come in!
Oh... Comms are back online,

23:00.963 --> 23:03.716
‐ but where are you?
‐ Right here, Ms Jones!

23:03.716 --> 23:06.302
Oh, you succeeded!
Congratulations!

23:08.929 --> 23:12.850
I know what I did was wrong,
and I know I don't deserve to be

23:12.850 --> 23:14.727
part of Ghost Force any more,
so...

23:14.727 --> 23:17.021
You're not getting away
that easily.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.483
‐ Oh!
‐ Cool.

23:21.483 --> 23:25.988
You think everything I built
worked the first time around?

23:25.988 --> 23:29.199
It took me several glitchy
Freonic‐Ghost‐Blaster tests

23:29.199 --> 23:32.953
before I got one right.
Same goes for this jalopy.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.998
It's a prototype,
so it won't be perfect,

23:35.998 --> 23:39.710
but it will evolve over time
and learn from mistakes,

23:39.710 --> 23:40.628
just like all of you.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.966
‐ So cool!
‐ (Gasps) Careful, Andy!

23:45.966 --> 23:47.593
It's not quite ready.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.222
GLOWBOO: Like I say,
always wear your seatbelt.
