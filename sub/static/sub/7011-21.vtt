WEBVTT

00:08.959 --> 00:11.829
That is the saddest sound
in the world.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.793
No more soda for Fez.

00:21.824 --> 00:23.679
And no more money for...

00:23.744 --> 00:27.322
- Fez, do you need me to buy you another soda?
- Eric, you do not <i>buy</i> soda.

00:27.392 --> 00:29.945
You only rent it.

00:31.872 --> 00:33.781
You know what I mean.

00:35.456 --> 00:37.528
I mean, you pee it out.

00:39.712 --> 00:41.621
Yeah, I got it. Go.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.215 --> 00:56.346
Well, I'll have to
remember that phone number.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.077
- Hi, Fez!
- Caroline! What are you doing?

01:02.144 --> 01:04.991
I knew you'd be in here.
I saw you had the large root beer.

01:05.055 --> 01:09.081
- Caroline, you have to leave me alone.
- But I wanna be with you!

01:09.151 --> 01:11.672
But I told you
we're through because...

01:11.744 --> 01:13.598
I am with Donna.

01:13.664 --> 01:15.518
Yes?
Remember? Donna?

01:15.584 --> 01:18.879
Well, you'd better be, because if you're not
that means you still love me.

01:18.943 --> 01:21.845
And if you still love me
but you're not with me, I'll make you pay.

01:21.919 --> 01:25.214
That would only be scary
if I was lying about Donna and me.

01:28.031 --> 01:31.708
Well, if you are lying I'll know,
because I'll be watching you.

01:31.775 --> 01:33.466
Go ahead.
I'm not afraid.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.654
Oh, Eric, I'm afraid.

01:38.624 --> 01:39.933
What's wrong?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.775
When I broke up with crazy Caroline,
I told her I was dating Donna.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.655
But I'm <i>not</i> dating Donna.
<i>You</i> are dating Donna.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.141
Hey!
Could I borrow Donna?

01:50.207 --> 01:52.116
Sure.

02:31.271 --> 02:34.817
I don't wanna blink, 'cause I'm afraid
to miss even a second of your cuteness.

02:36.679 --> 02:39.549
I know.
It's torture for me too.

02:40.647 --> 02:42.622
I could tear your eyelids off.

02:43.783 --> 02:47.361
Let's go, Michael, to a place
where our love is understood.

02:48.391 --> 02:50.912
Oh, hey, while you're there
check out the new monkey house.

02:55.752 --> 02:57.607
It never ends with those two.

02:57.672 --> 03:00.770
I love you, I love you,
I love you...

03:01.895 --> 03:03.750
Guys, it won't last.

03:03.815 --> 03:06.150
Look, an object in an unnatural state...

03:06.215 --> 03:08.070
must return to its natural state.

03:08.135 --> 03:10.623
Thus, Kelso and Jackie'll
have a fight any day.

03:10.696 --> 03:12.419
Really?

03:12.487 --> 03:14.975
It's simple physics.

03:18.184 --> 03:20.999
Hey, you guys, you know what?
We should get a pool going.

03:21.064 --> 03:23.747
We'll draw days for five bucks.
If they fight on your day, you win the pot.

03:23.815 --> 03:27.263
The pot?
If that's the prize, I am in.

03:29.639 --> 03:31.232
Hey, guys.

03:31.303 --> 03:33.158
Hey.

03:33.223 --> 03:36.769
<i>Donna, I can't thank you enough</i>
<i>for agreeing to help me with Caroline.</i>

03:36.839 --> 03:38.694
Hey, anything for a friend.

03:38.759 --> 03:41.792
But if she tries to hurt me,
I'm using you as a shield.

03:41.863 --> 03:43.424
Likewise.

03:45.416 --> 03:48.677
So, while you're with Fez, looks like
Forman'll be living the single life.

03:48.744 --> 03:51.329
Oh, yeah. That's right.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.701
Oh, now you won't get to take me
to see <i>The Turning Point.</i>

03:53.767 --> 03:57.345
The ballerina movie?
Oh, no.

03:59.975 --> 04:01.884
Need somethin', Bob?

04:04.008 --> 04:06.822
Well, it's a funny thing.

04:06.888 --> 04:10.117
The wife and I, we're taking out
a second mortgage on the house.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.038
Well, that's not the funny part...

04:12.103 --> 04:14.110
'cause we're pretty much destitute.

04:15.943 --> 04:18.277
It's a little bit funny, Bob.

04:18.343 --> 04:20.197
Anyways...

04:20.262 --> 04:22.598
I'm looking at
the deed to the property...

04:22.663 --> 04:28.380
and the map shows that I own a couple feet of
your driveway and a little bit of your garage.

04:29.895 --> 04:33.408
How'd you like to own
a little bit of my foot in your ass?

04:35.911 --> 04:39.140
I wouldn't, to be quite honest.

04:39.207 --> 04:41.117
It's free.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.484
So, our first date.

04:52.551 --> 04:55.617
I guess we're officially a couple now.

04:57.287 --> 04:59.360
A couple of knuckleheads, huh?

05:02.247 --> 05:04.549
May we laugh.

05:04.615 --> 05:07.299
- Oh! There she is.
- Okay. Showtime.

06:24.487 --> 06:27.236
Yeah. Yeah.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:31.623 --> 06:34.438
So, should I watch
a ballerina movie...

06:34.503 --> 06:36.608
or <i>Get Smart?</i>

06:36.679 --> 06:38.534
<i>Get Smart</i> it is.

06:39.784 --> 06:41.693
That's right.
I said <i>Get Smart.</i>

06:47.271 --> 06:50.620
I'm sorry, Donna.
Did you want the last piece?

06:53.191 --> 06:55.940
Well, it's too late.

06:56.007 --> 06:58.112
That's right.
I said too late.

07:02.311 --> 07:05.573
Yeah, that was me.
That's right. That was me.

07:10.247 --> 07:13.062
Hey, Hyde!
Welcome to the bachelor life.

07:13.127 --> 07:14.982
You know, without Donna...

07:15.047 --> 07:17.862
I've realized that I can revert
to my natural state.

07:17.927 --> 07:20.262
I'm dirty, I'm lazy...

07:20.327 --> 07:23.142
and I don't wear pants.

07:23.207 --> 07:25.094
- I'm just like you.
- No, no.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.127
See, I'm an original.
A Warhol.

07:28.199 --> 07:30.108
You're just a print.

07:31.175 --> 07:33.029
Those are some
pretty strong words...

07:33.095 --> 07:35.484
coming from a guy
who's wearing pants.

07:35.559 --> 07:37.414
Wait.
This is my favorite part.

07:42.599 --> 07:44.508
Oh, yeah, that was me.

07:45.959 --> 07:49.308
That's right.
That was <i>me!</i>

07:52.967 --> 07:55.138
Bob, that's my stuff!

07:55.207 --> 07:58.371
You put the hell back my stuff!

07:58.439 --> 08:01.254
Sorry, Red.
It was in my part of the garage.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.798
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?

08:05.863 --> 08:08.733
Kitty...
Kitty, let me talk to him.

08:10.215 --> 08:12.965
Bob, get the hell
out of my garage!

08:13.031 --> 08:14.886
Fine.

08:22.247 --> 08:24.157
There ya go.

08:31.271 --> 08:33.126
Hey.

08:33.191 --> 08:35.046
Hey,
how goes the pool?

08:35.111 --> 08:37.664
Great.
I sold 15 spots.

08:37.735 --> 08:39.590
I got today.
You got tomorrow.

08:39.655 --> 08:42.470
What? That bites.
They're never gonna last until then.

08:42.534 --> 08:44.990
Who won't last until what?

08:45.063 --> 08:47.452
- What? Huh?
- Huh? What?

08:48.487 --> 08:50.341
Oh. Oh. I, uh...

08:50.407 --> 08:54.116
I smashed a couple of toes. We're waiting
to see how long before the nails fall off.

08:54.183 --> 08:56.071
I wanna play.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.469
Uh, Michael,
you're a little busy right now.

08:58.535 --> 09:01.437
But, Jackie, those toenails
could fall off at any minute.

09:01.511 --> 09:03.366
Hey! Me!

09:03.431 --> 09:05.341
I'm sorry, puddin'.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.756
All right.
Now I feel like pudding.

09:10.791 --> 09:12.701
Hey! Me too!
Let's go.

09:15.783 --> 09:18.598
Well, I believe this is mine.
Thank you all for playing.

09:18.663 --> 09:20.802
What?
That wasn't a fight.

09:20.871 --> 09:23.685
Okay, we'll let Fez decide.
Fez, fight or no?

09:24.711 --> 09:27.361
Sorry, Eric.
I have to say no.

09:27.431 --> 09:29.286
- The pool goes on.
- But, Fez, I...

09:29.351 --> 09:31.523
It goes on.

09:35.559 --> 09:38.429
Ah, what the hell?
Now <i>I</i> want pudding.

09:39.751 --> 09:41.661
I'm with you, brother.
Let's roll.

09:47.591 --> 09:50.461
Thank God.
I thought they'd never leave.

10:00.103 --> 10:03.005
No, no. Don't get
all gussied up for me.

10:03.079 --> 10:07.138
I just came by to make sure you're okay.
You know, not too lonely without me.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.468
What, are you kidding me?
I'm having a great time!

10:10.534 --> 10:14.877
I... I feel like I've really
learned a lot about... Eric.

10:14.951 --> 10:17.918
Oh. Well, I'm glad
you're having fun.

10:17.991 --> 10:19.846
Oh, but what about you?

10:19.911 --> 10:22.399
Pretending to be Fez's girlfriend
has to be kind of a drag. Right?

10:22.471 --> 10:25.285
No! Fez is great. Last night
he took me to play putt-putt.

10:25.351 --> 10:28.165
And tonight
he's taking me on a hayride.

10:28.231 --> 10:30.238
Fez is so charming.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.882
You know, I can see
why Caroline's stalking him.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.414
- You know, I would've taken you on a hayride...
- Eric, Eric.

10:40.487 --> 10:44.513
The important thing is that you're having
a great time, and I'm having a great time.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.852
So have a great time.

10:46.919 --> 10:49.668
No, <i>you</i> have a great time.

10:49.735 --> 10:52.004
Oh, I will.

10:52.071 --> 10:53.597
Well, I will too.

11:09.478 --> 11:12.707
Eric, I cannot thank you enough
for lending me your girlfriend.

11:14.053 --> 11:17.698
It feels so good to be in
a normal, healthy relationship.

11:20.358 --> 11:23.108
Fez, it's a fake,
pretend relationship.

11:23.174 --> 11:25.279
You say tomato,
I say tomato.

11:28.805 --> 11:30.660
Fez, "to-mah-to."

11:30.725 --> 11:32.416
What?

11:33.382 --> 11:35.040
You say "to-mah-to."

11:35.110 --> 11:38.143
Why would I say "to-mah-to"?
That's not even a word, dummy.

11:42.566 --> 11:44.704
Yeah. I'm sorry.

11:44.773 --> 11:48.221
It's okay, Eric.
Different strokes for different strokes.

11:53.542 --> 11:55.451
Right.

11:55.526 --> 11:58.657
All I know is, if I was married
to a woman like Donna...

11:58.725 --> 12:00.635
it would be heavens.

12:01.990 --> 12:05.023
Oh, the high jinks
we would get into.

12:12.965 --> 12:15.387
Lucy, I'm home!

12:15.462 --> 12:18.015
<i>Ricky, is that you?</i>

12:26.182 --> 12:28.091
Lucy, what happened to you?

12:29.478 --> 12:33.602
Oh, Ricky, I was making
molasses cookies for your band...

12:33.670 --> 12:35.579
and I had an accident!

12:36.838 --> 12:38.747
Oh, Lucy.

12:40.709 --> 12:42.782
- Uh-oh.
- Ricky!

12:42.854 --> 12:46.050
We're stuck!

12:46.117 --> 12:48.027
I'll get it.

12:50.150 --> 12:54.144
<i>?Ayayayayay!</i>

13:05.510 --> 13:07.420
Hi, neighbors!

13:09.253 --> 13:12.570
Lucy, I brought you
that flour for your cookies.

13:12.645 --> 13:14.718
Oh, Ethel, you're a pal!

13:15.910 --> 13:18.910
Gee, Fred, would it hurt you
to hug me like that?

13:18.982 --> 13:20.836
Well, probably not.

13:20.902 --> 13:22.789
But why take the chance?

13:27.397 --> 13:30.212
Hey, Fred, we got
a sticky situation here.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.132
You wanna help us out?

13:32.197 --> 13:34.499
Sure, Rick.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.420
Watch it, Fred!

13:36.485 --> 13:39.998
Boy, you kids really are stuck.

13:44.966 --> 13:48.282
Waaaaah!

13:48.358 --> 13:52.035
Waaaaah!

13:53.190 --> 13:56.451
Waaaaah!

14:00.934 --> 14:03.236
Oh, Lucy.

14:04.870 --> 14:07.259
Well, I'm off to romance our lady.

14:07.334 --> 14:09.188
Oh...

14:09.254 --> 14:12.417
Hey, Fez, Donna hasn't been...

14:12.486 --> 14:15.300
I don't know, like,
mentioning me or anything?

14:15.366 --> 14:17.220
No.

14:17.286 --> 14:21.955
Well, that... that's okay. That's good,
'cause I haven't been talking about her either.

14:22.021 --> 14:25.218
Of course, I've been alone,
so I'd just be talking to myself.

14:25.286 --> 14:27.195
And that's not normal.

14:28.741 --> 14:32.003
Have to be pretty crazy
to talk to myself, wouldn't I?

14:33.349 --> 14:35.259
Yes. Yes, I would.

14:38.662 --> 14:40.571
Okay, I gotta get some pants.

14:49.894 --> 14:51.836
Damn.

14:55.173 --> 14:57.028
Oh, hey, Kelso, uh...

14:57.093 --> 14:58.948
Pam Macy called...

14:59.013 --> 15:02.843
and she said she had a really great time
making out with you last night.

15:05.765 --> 15:08.154
- Michael!
- No! No! We did not!

15:08.230 --> 15:10.881
Fight! Fight! Fight!

15:10.950 --> 15:12.804
- No fair, man.
- Shut up!

15:12.870 --> 15:16.066
- My day's almost over! Now, hurry up and fight!
- What?

15:16.133 --> 15:18.337
Oh, no!

15:18.405 --> 15:21.569
- Would you watch it!
- Isn't Kelso a klutz? I think you should hit him.

15:23.653 --> 15:25.857
Steven, why are you
trying to make us fight?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.194
'Cause I've got today in the pool.
Come on, Jackie, hit him!

15:28.261 --> 15:30.116
Oh, my God.
I get it.

15:30.181 --> 15:32.036
The pool wasn't about
Steven's toenails.

15:32.101 --> 15:34.916
These idiots bet on
when you and I would fight.

15:34.981 --> 15:37.763
Kelso! Are you gonna take that, man?
She called your friends idiots.

15:37.830 --> 15:39.618
You better start kickin' some ass!

15:41.126 --> 15:42.981
No, wait.
The pool was about us?

15:43.046 --> 15:45.915
Damn!
I wish I had a piece of that!

15:49.445 --> 15:51.551
You would wager against our love?

15:51.622 --> 15:55.200
Well, damn, Jackie! In a lifetime,
how often do you have a run at a sure thing?

15:56.230 --> 15:58.085
Game over!

15:58.150 --> 16:00.965
What's all the racket?

16:01.030 --> 16:04.445
Oh, that's just the sweet sound
of me winning 75 bucks.

16:04.518 --> 16:06.623
<i>Aha!</i>
<i>Not so fast, cheater!</i>

16:06.694 --> 16:10.142
It's two minutes past midnight, which means
it's the next day, which means you lose.

16:10.213 --> 16:12.068
Ah!
Serves you right.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.272
- Yeah.
- Oh, shut up, Michael.

16:15.942 --> 16:20.415
Looks like the winner
is "R.F." Who's R.F.?

16:26.342 --> 16:29.538
I believe this is mine.
Thank you all very much.

16:37.350 --> 16:39.619
All right, hand over my preserves.

16:39.686 --> 16:42.686
They were in our garage,
and now they're not.

16:42.758 --> 16:45.376
Oh, that's terrible, Kitty.

16:45.446 --> 16:49.407
Why don't you sit down and relax
with some toast and homemade jam?

16:50.661 --> 16:53.476
- Jam?
- Yeah. We found it in our garage.

16:53.541 --> 16:55.680
It's <i>our</i> garage!

16:55.750 --> 16:58.205
And that's my jam!

16:58.278 --> 17:00.187
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

17:01.637 --> 17:04.452
You know, you two
just don't get it, do you?

17:04.517 --> 17:06.786
That jam was on my property.

17:07.877 --> 17:09.787
I'll show you the deed.

17:12.678 --> 17:15.547
There's my lot.
There's yours.

17:15.621 --> 17:17.890
There's the property line right there.

17:26.693 --> 17:28.668
Oops.

17:28.742 --> 17:30.596
Well...

17:30.662 --> 17:33.247
Looks like I own
part of <i>your</i> property.

17:34.533 --> 17:37.981
I, uh... I will not stand
for this trickery!

17:39.110 --> 17:40.965
You get out of my house!

17:41.030 --> 17:42.623
No problem.

17:52.965 --> 17:56.129
Okay. No one answered
the phone at Eric's house.

17:56.197 --> 17:58.052
What could he be doing?

17:58.117 --> 18:00.386
Where could he go with no pants?

18:04.709 --> 18:07.524
Donna, when we're in public,
you are with me.

18:07.589 --> 18:09.793
Eric is dead to you.

18:10.886 --> 18:13.853
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

18:13.925 --> 18:16.227
Move it!

18:16.294 --> 18:18.977
Oh, boy.
Here comes trouble.

18:19.045 --> 18:20.900
Caroline.

18:20.965 --> 18:25.700
I was just offering my girlfriend Donna
a sip from my straw.

18:25.765 --> 18:29.595
We don't care about germs, because
she has had her tongue in my mouth.

18:38.374 --> 18:41.188
You know what I think?
I think this is all an act.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.108
I don't think you're really dating.

18:43.174 --> 18:46.785
Oh, yeah? Well... Well, maybe...
maybe this will convince you.

18:49.894 --> 18:52.861
Come on, Donna.
Put some leg into it.

18:52.933 --> 18:54.788
Give me a break.

18:54.853 --> 18:58.333
If you were really together, you'd have
at least gotten to second base by now.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.634
You know,
when you are right, you are right.

19:04.869 --> 19:06.779
All right, all right.
Enough.

19:06.853 --> 19:09.406
Caroline, Fez doesn't like you.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.667
Is that true, Fez?

19:13.957 --> 19:15.866
Yes.

19:17.126 --> 19:18.980
Wow.

19:19.046 --> 19:22.112
I guess we really are over.

19:22.182 --> 19:24.091
Okay!
Enjoy your movie.

19:26.853 --> 19:28.708
- Ow.
- Sorry.

19:28.773 --> 19:31.107
- It's okay.
- Hey, Eric.

19:31.174 --> 19:33.312
Lookin' good.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.291
Call me.

19:38.021 --> 19:39.810
Eric, what are you doing here?

19:39.877 --> 19:41.732
Are you kidding me?

19:41.797 --> 19:43.706
It's <i>The Turning Point.</i>

19:44.997 --> 19:48.226
I love ballet movies.
They make you think, you know?

19:48.293 --> 19:52.417
How did their feet get so pointy?
That's a mystery I'm determined to solve.

19:54.566 --> 19:56.802
- What?
- You miss me.

19:56.869 --> 19:58.593
Well...

19:58.662 --> 20:00.418
you missed me.

20:00.485 --> 20:02.012
I really did.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.370
Excuse me.

20:14.405 --> 20:16.315
Our date is not over.

20:18.181 --> 20:20.090
Now, good day, sir.

20:22.310 --> 20:25.277
- But, Fez...
- I said good day.

20:27.462 --> 20:29.851
Fez, I'm not going anywhere.

20:32.037 --> 20:33.761
Fine.
Then good day.

20:33.830 --> 20:36.829
- Fez!
- I said good day!

20:40.741 --> 20:43.523
Lucy, these brownies are wonderful.

20:43.590 --> 20:46.404
They make me feel silly.

20:50.310 --> 20:53.124
Don't you just love
those dried mint flakes?

20:53.190 --> 20:56.004
Someone sold 'em to me off the street!

20:56.070 --> 20:59.844
Um, I don't think these
are mint flakes. I'm flyin'!

21:02.309 --> 21:05.124
Lucy, you got
some 'splainin' to do.
