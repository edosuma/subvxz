00:01.540 --> 00:04.830
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...
Who's Robert?
No one.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.540
You'll be fitted with a
location-monitoring device

00:06.540 --> 00:08.170
and stay confined
to your residence.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.210
If we can't trust each other,
what do we have?

00:10.210 --> 00:11.710
They turned.

00:11.710 --> 00:12.790
You can't be surprised

00:12.790 --> 00:14.880
that they finally
chose themselves.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.380
Nate must've already
handed over copies of
the files to the FBI.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.670
Why would he do that?

00:18.670 --> 00:20.250
To cut his own deal.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.620
Nate told me
he was done with all of us.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.620
He's not gonna have much left
in him once I get done.

00:24.620 --> 00:25.920
Don't go near him.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.120
He can't know
that we know.

00:28.830 --> 00:30.500
Hey, Ma.
I need you.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.250
Mr. Maddox, this is
Special Agent Pollock.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.670
Gabriel:
I know who killed Asher.

00:34.670 --> 00:35.710
Michaela: Who?

00:35.710 --> 00:37.170
It was the FBI.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.880
Just got back from the FBI.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.040
Why were you at the FBI?

00:46.040 --> 00:47.170
Because I saw
who killed Asher --

00:47.170 --> 00:48.960
You're just telling us
this now?

00:48.960 --> 00:50.040
I thought it was Laurel!

00:50.040 --> 00:51.540
Why would you think
it was Laurel?

00:51.540 --> 00:53.500
Because it was a woman,
and she had brown hair,

00:53.500 --> 00:55.710
and then you told me that Laurel
used to live in Asher's.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.920
Is this just you pointing
the finger at someone else?

00:57.920 --> 00:59.960
No, i-i-it's an FBI agent
that I met tonight!

00:59.960 --> 01:01.460
Alright?
Her name's Denise Pollock.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.120
And she was Asher's handler,
and she killed him.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.330
Why wouldn't you stop her?
He was already dead.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.460
Is this just some
sort of set-up?

01:07.460 --> 01:09.420
You're trying to catch us saying
something dumb on a wire?

01:09.420 --> 01:10.830
Was what happened to
Fred Hampton dumb?

01:10.830 --> 01:12.170
What are you
talking about?
Oh, my God.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.500
The FBI had him shot
and killed

01:14.500 --> 01:16.580
while he was sleeping next
to his pregnant fiancÃ©e.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.290
Did you just compare Asher
to a Black Panther?

01:18.290 --> 01:20.080
The FBI wants to
take down Annalise.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.960
So they killed the guy
informing against her.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.500
You don't know what
you're talking about.
You guys could be next.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.080
I just came here
to warn you.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.830
No, you're here to
make us all paranoid.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.830
Now, get the hell out.

01:28.830 --> 01:30.960
I'm telling the truth.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.290
Get out!

01:47.420 --> 01:48.750
He seemed like
he was telling the truth.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.750
Don't say that.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.330
Don't say anything.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.420
Bugged.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.880
I say we go in
quick and dirty.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.500
We ask for the one
additional location,

02:27.500 --> 02:29.420
and you don't seem greedy.
But I am greedy.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.580
Well, I'm calling
this shot.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.830
We're early in
this battle,

02:31.830 --> 02:33.000
and you don't
bust out your dragon

02:33.000 --> 02:34.290
until you get
to King's Landing

02:34.290 --> 02:35.710
and are prepared to
sack the Red Keep.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.040
English, please.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.040
"Game of Thrones,"
I'm your Khaleesi!

02:39.040 --> 02:40.000
Robert: Annalise!

02:41.500 --> 02:43.080
What the hell
are you doing here?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.500
I love this new look.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.000
You haven't
returned my calls.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.250
For a reason.
Right, I know --
you've been preoccupied.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.830
And please don't accuse me
of working with the FBI.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.000
Are you?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.290
I want to help, Annalise.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.420
Can you get
my charges dropped?

02:56.420 --> 02:59.580
I'm a damn good lawyer,
I'll join the team pro bono.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.710
Listen, Robert,
we've had some nice dates.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.170
We danced.

03:03.170 --> 03:05.210
But I'm being accused
of murder.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.000
And any sane person would
run for the hills.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.460
Annalise, come on...

03:10.790 --> 03:12.380
What is this about?

03:12.380 --> 03:14.380
Other than you clearly
wanting to seem crazy?

03:14.380 --> 03:16.540
I'm not crazy, I just...

03:17.920 --> 03:20.830
Okay, fine, maybe she did make
me a little crazy, but...

03:20.830 --> 03:23.620
Honestly, I like it.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.210
Her.

03:25.210 --> 03:27.790
Well, take your crazy to
the bar across the street.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.290
You can probably find
some lonely, successful ladies

03:30.290 --> 03:31.750
to meet there.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.080
You speaking
from experience?

03:34.750 --> 03:36.040
Get.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.080
Judge Vitkay:
I'm not going to suspend

03:40.080 --> 03:41.670
your client's house arrest,
Ms. Price.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.460
Our motion isn't to
suspend the house arrest,

03:43.460 --> 03:46.000
but to increase the range
to my office at C&G.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.210
Ms. Keating
is a flight risk,

03:47.210 --> 03:49.040
she was just extradited
from Mexico.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.080
Then it's a good thing my office
is in Center City, not Mexico.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.460
Ms. Keating lives
in a penthouse,

03:53.460 --> 03:55.290
there is plenty of room to
conduct her defense there.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.960
This is a federal trial
that will entail

03:56.960 --> 03:58.040
weeks of preparation.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.880
As such, my client and I

03:59.880 --> 04:02.120
will need as much time
and flexibility as possible

04:02.120 --> 04:03.170
to mount
an adequate defense.

04:03.170 --> 04:04.920
Adequate defenses
are mounted

04:04.920 --> 04:06.750
under house arrest
all of the time.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.960
And Ms. Keating's meetings
with witnesses and experts?

04:08.960 --> 04:10.420
Is she meant to
host them in her home?

04:10.420 --> 04:12.670
You've made your point,
Ms. Price.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.080
The court agrees to expand
Ms. Keating's house arrest

04:15.080 --> 04:18.170
to include Caplan & Gold,
effective immediately.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.580
You proud of me or what?

04:19.580 --> 04:20.920
You should've
asked for more.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.080
Your Honor, my office
would also like to file

04:23.080 --> 04:24.880
a notice of intent today.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.580
For?
To make this
a capital murder case

04:27.580 --> 04:29.960
and pursue the death penalty
against Ms. Keating.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.500
Your Honor, this
is prosecutorial misconduct!
On what grounds?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.380
The defendant is being
charged with the murders

04:33.380 --> 04:36.040
of assistant district attorney
Emily Sinclair

04:36.040 --> 04:38.460
and federal informant
Asher Millstone.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.000
This is a retaliatory move meant
only to intimidate me, Judge!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.290
If you want to challenge
the Government's

04:42.290 --> 04:43.920
notice of intent...
Today, please!
I do!

04:43.920 --> 04:45.830
...take it up with
the Department of Justice.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.460
For now, the AUSA's intention
to pursue the death penalty

04:48.460 --> 04:50.330
is noted and so carried.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.380
Court dismissed.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.080
Yes...
Uh-huh...

05:07.580 --> 05:10.790
Okay...

05:10.790 --> 05:12.620
Bye.

05:12.620 --> 05:13.750
Oliver: What now?

05:17.330 --> 05:19.120
That was my lawyer,
she says the government

05:19.120 --> 05:21.080
is seeking the death penalty
for Annalise.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.170
I thought the death penalty
was suspended in Pennsylvania.

05:23.170 --> 05:24.920
Annalise's case
is Federal, not State.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.750
So, yeah,
they can execute her.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.830
I was tailed
on my run last night.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.290
What?
Stop.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.620
It was a black SUV,
probably the FBI.

05:34.620 --> 05:36.250
No, this is just
how paranoia works,

05:36.250 --> 05:37.710
you -- your mind
is making things up.

05:37.710 --> 05:40.830
Or the FBI heard everything
that Gabriel told us,

05:40.830 --> 05:42.120
which means it's all true --

05:42.120 --> 05:43.580
they killed Asher

05:43.580 --> 05:46.120
and now they want to do the same
to Annalise.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.290
We signed a deal with
the devil, Michaela.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.210
The law is on our side.
The law doesn't matter

05:53.210 --> 05:55.380
when there are corrupt people
in power who want me dead.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.460
You think this
is the Governor?

05:56.460 --> 05:58.420
She doesn't have control
over a federal case.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.790
Don't be a fool.
I'll get this thrown out,
Annalise.

06:00.790 --> 06:03.830
Even better, I'll use it to
prove that your conspiracy case

06:03.830 --> 06:05.580
is actually a conspiracy
against you

06:05.580 --> 06:07.170
by a corrupt, overzealous
government.

06:07.170 --> 06:09.790
It's that same government
who made this call, Tegan!

06:09.790 --> 06:11.250
Not a judge, not a jury.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.620
A jury will never go
for this in the end.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.170
A white jury who
the Feds will guarantee

06:14.170 --> 06:15.790
are all pro-death penalty
might.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.080
How is that helpful?

06:17.080 --> 06:18.330
We don't have time
for denial.

06:18.330 --> 06:19.960
No one is in denial.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.250
I have a meeting
with the AUSA

06:21.250 --> 06:23.080
in two hours
to get this thrown out.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.830
I am really good
at my job!

06:28.830 --> 06:30.580
Ms. Keating,
you have a visitor.

06:30.580 --> 06:32.750
Please tell me his name
is not Robert.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.330
It's a woman.
Her name is Vivian.

06:35.330 --> 06:37.040
Oh, hell no.

06:40.210 --> 06:42.170
Here to drop off more
of Sam's therapy tapes?

06:42.170 --> 06:43.790
Or did the FBI
send you again?

06:43.790 --> 06:45.790
They're who I came
to talk to you about.

06:45.790 --> 06:48.500
Great, tell them that I'm suing
them and you for harassment.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.250
They killed Asher,
Annalise.

06:51.250 --> 06:54.620
The FBI, they're who
killed that boy.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.290
Gabe -- he didn't tell anyone
because he didn't see her face.

07:02.290 --> 07:03.540
But now that he knows
who she is,

07:03.540 --> 07:05.830
this Agent Pollock,
he's scared.

07:05.830 --> 07:08.040
As am I.
Not that he needs to know that.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.420
Does Gabriel know
that you're here?

07:11.580 --> 07:13.210
You're still lying to him
after everything?

07:14.750 --> 07:16.210
I can't.

07:16.210 --> 07:18.500
You think I'd come to you
if I had another option?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.500
I'm not falling for
another set-up, Vivian.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.420
I'm here as a mother,
that's all.

07:22.420 --> 07:23.920
My son is the only
eyewitness

07:23.920 --> 07:26.290
in a murder committed
by an FBI agent.

07:26.290 --> 07:28.170
God knows he's probably
next on their hit list.

07:28.170 --> 07:30.420
I've got my own life to
worry about right now.

07:30.420 --> 07:32.790
If Gabriel goes on record
about what he saw,

07:32.790 --> 07:35.120
that blows up the FBI's
whole case against you.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.210
What do you want?

07:38.210 --> 07:39.830
Make Gabriel's
statement anonymous.

07:39.830 --> 07:40.750
That can't happen.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.500
You can make
anything happen.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.710
That's why Gabriel stayed
to learn from you.

07:43.710 --> 07:44.920
Go home.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.580
What if I know something else
that'll help your case?

07:49.580 --> 07:51.580
What?

07:51.580 --> 07:53.120
Say you'll help
Gabriel first.

07:55.670 --> 07:58.000
Fool me once, girl.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.620
Annalise, please!

08:02.210 --> 08:04.620
She's lying. Gabe and her cooked
up that story to trap you.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.790
We can still use it.

08:05.790 --> 08:07.540
Dig into Agent Pollock.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.620
See if there's any chance
that she did this to Asher.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.250
On it.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.500
Wait.
We should tell Nate.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.880
Why?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.790
So he knows who
he signed a deal with.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.170
That means outing
we know he turned.

08:18.170 --> 08:19.790
It'll scare him
back to our side.

08:21.420 --> 08:22.880
No.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.710
His testimony is the thing
that can convict you --

08:25.710 --> 08:27.330
and now get you
the death penalty.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.920
I said no.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.120
Find Pollock,
we'll plan our next move.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.380
What'd Vivian say?

08:36.380 --> 08:38.120
Oh, she's in more
drug trouble.

08:39.540 --> 08:41.290
Okay, no. Unh-unh.

08:41.290 --> 08:43.460
No more secret
inner circle crap.

08:43.460 --> 08:44.540
Fess up.

08:46.670 --> 08:50.830
Alright. An FBI agent
might've killed Asher.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.420
Gabriel: Annalise
is the last person

08:52.420 --> 08:53.750
you should be telling
my business to.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.120
You chose to stay here because
she's such a great lawyer.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.460
And that's what
you need right now.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.960
Not her.
Is this about
the therapy tapes?

08:59.960 --> 09:02.750
Because I am willing to forgive
her for wrecking my marriage

09:02.750 --> 09:04.500
if it means
getting you safe.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.080
She threatened
to kill me.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.040
What?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.960
Not her.
But her guy...

09:12.670 --> 09:14.460
Here.

09:14.460 --> 09:17.790
I wish that
I had killed Sam.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.500
That's how much
I hated the guy.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.250
Maybe killing his son
is the next best thing.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.790
I guess she thought
I was informing against her.

09:26.790 --> 09:28.210
That guy...

09:28.210 --> 09:30.120
That's Frank?

09:30.120 --> 09:31.670
You know him?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.120
Your aunt knew him.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.250
My aunt?

09:40.250 --> 09:42.880
Sam has an older sister.
Hannah.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.120
She grew up knowing
Frank's family.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.460
You're just telling me
this now?

09:51.460 --> 09:53.080
She's not a good person
for you to know, baby.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.500
That's not a decision
for you to make.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.040
I ran away from that family
for a reason, Gabriel.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.750
No, you ran because
Sam screwed Annalise.

10:00.290 --> 10:03.540
That's what pushed me
out the door, yes.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.580
But Hannah
is part of it, too.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.210
Making this
a capital murder case

10:13.210 --> 10:15.330
is a more-than-material fact.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.080
My lack of knowledge
about that is grounds

10:17.080 --> 10:20.040
for invalidating my contract
with the AUSA's office.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.540
So I -- I was thinking
we negotiate new terms

10:22.540 --> 10:24.670
for my deal -- which would
also apply to Connor's.

10:24.670 --> 10:26.460
Is everything okay,
Michaela?

10:26.460 --> 10:28.500
No.
I find it very upsetting

10:28.500 --> 10:31.120
that my testimony could result
in someone's execution.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.460
What happened?

10:33.460 --> 10:35.540
Did Annalise
contact you?
No.

10:35.540 --> 10:38.040
Then why are you trying
to sabotage this deal?

10:39.670 --> 10:42.580
Hypothetically,

10:42.580 --> 10:47.580
say the FBI was involved in
a death, Asher's for example.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.540
Wouldn't the charges against me
and Connor have to be dropped?

10:50.540 --> 10:53.380
We'd go free, no time
served at all, right?

10:53.380 --> 10:55.500
Sorry.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.960
Why would the FBI murder
its own informant?

11:00.580 --> 11:01.710
Michaela: Connor, what about
going to your lawyer?

11:01.710 --> 11:04.210
He sucks.
And he'll call your dad.

11:04.210 --> 11:05.080
Asher was killed
by the very people

11:05.080 --> 11:06.620
we are now working
with, Oliver.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.120
Get over your petty
father-in-law feud

11:08.120 --> 11:09.580
if you don't want to see
your husband go to jail.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.670
My crappy Hartford lawyer
isn't gonna keep us out of jail.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.380
Exactly,
but you know who can?

11:13.380 --> 11:15.080
Don't say Annalise.
Or Bonnie.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.420
You!

11:16.420 --> 11:18.670
The two smartest
almost-lawyers I know!

11:18.670 --> 11:20.330
So, come on,

11:20.330 --> 11:21.540
all you need to do
is read some more books

11:21.540 --> 11:23.580
and find some precedents.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.830
And I'll help!

11:25.830 --> 11:27.210
I'm gonna take a nap.

12:13.420 --> 12:14.750
Hey, you.

12:23.380 --> 12:24.830
Did you find her?
Frank: Yeah.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.330
Somebody better, too...

12:26.330 --> 12:28.670
Who?
Xavier.

12:28.670 --> 12:30.880
Where is he?

12:30.880 --> 12:33.380
Here, with me.

12:35.290 --> 12:37.500
Good timing, too...

12:37.500 --> 12:41.250
Pollock dropped him
a plane ticket and passport.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.830
This time tomorrow,
he would've been in Brazil.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.750
Frank.
We need to be smart.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.120
He can help us in court.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.380
I know.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.080
So tell me where you are.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.250
Just trust me.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.670
Trust me and tell me
where you are.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.750
Bon, this is not something
you need to see.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.670
Frank.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.460
Xavier:
I'll give you whatever you want.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.500
Are you ready to talk?

13:16.500 --> 13:19.620
Yeah.

13:19.620 --> 13:20.830
Ugh.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.460
What do you want?

13:22.460 --> 13:24.710
Agent Pollock.
She work for you?

13:26.880 --> 13:29.210
You know how easy it is to
buy people off, Frank.

13:29.210 --> 13:30.830
She the only FBI agent
you bought?

13:30.830 --> 13:32.380
Not Lanford, anyone else?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.120
Just her.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.580
And if you want, you.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.880
Huh?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.790
I know you
like the money.

13:42.790 --> 13:44.580
Laurel tell you that?

13:44.580 --> 13:47.330
The Mahoney money.

13:47.330 --> 13:48.830
Lisa:
What's better than sex?

13:50.920 --> 13:52.420
She'll never know it was you.

13:56.580 --> 13:57.710
I'm so sorry.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.500
You sold out Annalise once,

14:02.500 --> 14:05.750
I know you got it in you
to do it again.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.790
You know nothing,

14:07.790 --> 14:09.830
otherwise you'd understand

14:09.830 --> 14:13.420
that's the biggest regret
of my life.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.250
But I guess I'll just have
to take that out on you.

14:19.330 --> 14:22.080
Timothy McVeigh,
a Boston Marathon Bomber,

14:22.080 --> 14:23.620
and now Annalise Keating?

14:23.620 --> 14:26.120
You think her crimes match those
federal death row inmates?

14:26.120 --> 14:27.620
Definitely.
Oh, come on.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.170
She's as bad as a mob boss,
Tegan,

14:29.170 --> 14:30.420
that's who you're
representing.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.080
And you're taking orders
from the Governor, right?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.420
Meeting's over.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.920
Birkhead climbed
the political ladder

14:35.920 --> 14:37.790
at the same time
as your boss.

14:37.790 --> 14:40.670
Out.
Or is it a family-run business
with deep pockets?

14:40.670 --> 14:42.460
The Castillos?
Come on.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.620
You're too sane to buy
into a conspiracy theory.

14:44.620 --> 14:47.420
The conspiracy here is you
trying to execute my client.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.790
No, that'll be up
to a jury.

14:48.790 --> 14:50.170
No pressure.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.330
Montes is digging in,
to the point that even

14:56.330 --> 14:59.830
I'm starting to believe
Gabriel's whack-ass story.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.210
Good thing we can
still challenge this

15:01.210 --> 15:02.710
with the
Capital Review Committee.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.500
You mean with
the five other lawyers

15:04.500 --> 15:05.790
who work for the same
Attorney General

15:05.790 --> 15:07.000
who approved this charge?

15:07.000 --> 15:07.880
Negativity
is not productive.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.330
It's going to take weeks

15:09.330 --> 15:10.670
to get in front of that
committee, Tegan.

15:10.670 --> 15:13.040
And when we do, we hit them
with the truth --

15:13.040 --> 15:15.120
that you are
a social justice activist

15:15.120 --> 15:17.750
who's consistently been a thorn
in the side of law enforcement,

15:17.750 --> 15:20.290
including last year
when you humiliated the FBI

15:20.290 --> 15:22.120
during Gabriel's
terrorism case.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.790
What?

15:27.790 --> 15:29.670
Let the dragon out.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.830
I need your help.

15:32.830 --> 15:36.580
My life depends on it.

15:36.580 --> 15:41.790
Otherwise I could very well
end up on death row.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.750
I'm no conspiracy theorist.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.790
I don't believe in shadow
governments or deep states...

15:45.790 --> 15:47.500
What is she doing?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.210
Ain't that always
the question with her?

15:49.210 --> 15:51.210
I don't need
farfetched stories

15:51.210 --> 15:54.580
to know that
our country's a mess.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.620
How else do you explain
a government

15:56.620 --> 15:58.460
that is funding a system

15:58.460 --> 16:02.250
that has sent over 1,500 people
to their "legal deaths"?

16:02.250 --> 16:04.580
And then, when you think that
almost half of those murdered

16:04.580 --> 16:06.120
are black?

16:06.120 --> 16:09.620
Even though we represent
only 13% of the population?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.790
The Fed's case against me

16:13.790 --> 16:17.040
is based solely on
the testimony of informants.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.750
Witnesses who are willing

16:18.750 --> 16:21.170
to let me die
to protect their own asses.

16:21.170 --> 16:22.500
And they're victims, too.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.620
Coerced and tricked
into lying against me.

16:25.620 --> 16:29.790
Because me, as an educated
black woman, is too dangerous.

16:29.790 --> 16:32.500
But I have the truth
on my side.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.540
And the truth here is that the
only conspiracy that's happening

16:36.540 --> 16:40.170
is that they don't like me.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.120
But I have proof, and I can't
wait to show all of you.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.830
If this bitch
says your name...

16:44.830 --> 16:47.460
And I'll save that
for trial...

16:47.460 --> 16:48.750
Right now, I need you to

16:48.750 --> 16:50.960
phone, e-mail, and text...

16:50.960 --> 16:52.750
and let
the Department of Justice know

16:52.750 --> 16:54.830
that we see them.

16:54.830 --> 16:56.420
We see their lies.

16:56.420 --> 16:57.920
We see their racism.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.250
And if they continue
to kill innocent people

17:00.250 --> 17:02.620
in the name of the law,

17:02.620 --> 17:06.290
then we will have no choice
but to come for them first.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.540
Oh, boy.

17:08.540 --> 17:09.750
Thank you for your time.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.540
My client's not taking
any questions,

17:12.540 --> 17:14.460
but I will stay back
for a few questions.

17:14.460 --> 17:17.330
One each, no follow-ups.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.620
Yes, I'm talking to you,
Paul.

17:19.620 --> 17:22.290
So, what's this I hear about you
wanting out of your deal?

17:23.830 --> 17:25.540
Don't yell at me.

17:25.540 --> 17:27.540
Frank found Xavier.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.710
Where are they?

17:29.710 --> 17:30.670
He won't tell me.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.000
Why not?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.830
Why do you think?

17:41.210 --> 17:43.000
Frank: It's Frank.
Leave a message.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.710
I'm tracking your phone
if you don't call me back.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.380
You want me to?
No.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.830
If he kills that man,
that's on him.

17:54.830 --> 17:57.710
He's not going to.
Oh, he might...

17:57.710 --> 18:00.250
and guess who's getting charged
with another thing I didn't do?

18:02.080 --> 18:04.710
He just wants answers
on Laurel.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.170
Then he'll call.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.210
He doesn't love Laurel.

18:14.210 --> 18:16.380
That's the last thing
on my mind right now.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.420
Really?

18:18.420 --> 18:20.620
When we're about to
go to jail, or worse?

18:20.620 --> 18:22.670
You're not worried about
whether the man you love

18:22.670 --> 18:23.920
loves you back?

18:34.790 --> 18:36.620
It's Frank.
Leave a message.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.170
You want Laurel back?
I know where she is.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.710
You think I'm as dumb
as I look?

18:51.710 --> 18:53.250
The reason this
all started?

18:53.250 --> 18:55.960
My family coming
after all of you?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.170
Is because Laurel begged
my father to find you.

19:00.580 --> 19:02.330
This is a social visit,

19:02.330 --> 19:03.960
or are you just here
to find your boyfriend?

19:03.960 --> 19:05.380
We'll talk in my office.

19:05.380 --> 19:07.120
Decide if this Frank guy
is worth your time.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.000
Laurel loved you, Frank.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
She loved you in a way
that terrified him.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.580
You know what Laurel
said about you?

19:17.580 --> 19:18.670
That you're a leech --

19:18.670 --> 19:21.790
always mooching off
Daddy's power.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.500
But he always loved
Laurel more.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.920
Which is also
why she loved me.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.920
I'm more like
your dad than you.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.500
Dark.
Disturbed.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.120
A monster.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.540
But Laurel's got
a good heart.

19:34.540 --> 19:38.040
And as much as I tried to be
the guy for her, I'm not.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.790
And I'm okay with that.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.920
'Cause I found someone
that knows me,

19:41.920 --> 19:45.420
the monster, too,
and she loves me for it.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.880
And her name's not Laurel.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.830
I say that so you stop
wasting your breath.

19:59.670 --> 20:01.670
Thanks.

20:01.670 --> 20:04.580
Is there a reason you
didn't want me inside?

20:04.580 --> 20:06.500
The FBI's probably
bugged the house.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.170
And since I already
have my lawyer

20:08.170 --> 20:09.710
spilling all my secrets
to you...

20:09.710 --> 20:11.500
I pay Kendra
a lot of money,

20:11.500 --> 20:13.250
so damn straight
she's gonna call me.

20:13.250 --> 20:16.040
Yeah, and who cares about
attorney-client privilege?

20:18.620 --> 20:20.420
Is there a reason
you didn't call me?

20:22.420 --> 20:25.040
Is it you who gave
Annalise up to the FBI?

20:25.040 --> 20:26.380
Is that what
she told you?

20:26.380 --> 20:27.290
Is it true?

20:27.290 --> 20:28.580
Yes.

20:28.580 --> 20:31.040
To protect you.
And why does it matter?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.080
Unless she's
in your head again?

20:32.080 --> 20:34.040
It's not like I'm some
impressionable baby.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.290
It's that they want to give
her the death penalty.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.580
That doesn't bother you?

20:38.580 --> 20:40.830
Look...

20:45.330 --> 20:48.620
I know that you're
not impressionable.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.460
I didn't think I was either
when I met Anna Mae Harkness.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.120
Even then,
me being her boss...

20:54.120 --> 20:57.830
I understand the power
that she wields.

20:57.830 --> 21:00.880
And it took me a long time
to get out from under it.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.170
That is why I slept
with your mother --

21:03.170 --> 21:06.000
to forget Annalise.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.620
And it turns out,
30 years later,

21:09.620 --> 21:13.290
that is the best decision
I ever made.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.620
Oliver: Solomon's good,
I'll give him that.

21:22.620 --> 21:26.170
He's out there convincing
Michaela to stay in your deal.

21:26.170 --> 21:28.500
Or he's working
for the FBI, too.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.210
Thanks for adding
to my paranoia.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.080
He's a Venture Capital
billionaire.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.580
You don't get that rich without
knowing how to cheat and lie.

21:35.580 --> 21:38.380
And let's just go with
the worst-case scenario.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.080
The you-know-who did
what Gabriel said,

21:41.080 --> 21:43.670
the death penalty
thing sticks.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.830
And then Annalise dies

21:44.830 --> 21:46.290
because Michaela and I
lied on the stand.

21:49.460 --> 21:52.380
You think I can live
a normal life after that?

21:52.380 --> 21:54.120
Working a 9:00-to-5:00?

21:54.120 --> 21:55.880
Debating whether or not
we adopt

21:55.880 --> 21:58.380
or
get a surrogate?

21:58.380 --> 22:01.040
Vacationing up north
with Pam?

22:01.040 --> 22:03.540
Or the Amalfi Coast, does that
make it more palatable...?

22:05.790 --> 22:08.880
Do it for me.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.120
Okay?
Then the blood's on my hands.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.960
You're okay with that?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.500
I just can't lose you.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.290
E-mail and text and let
the Department of Justice know

22:24.290 --> 22:26.250
that we see them.
Someone's here to see you.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.460
Vivian?
We see their lies.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.540
No.
We see their racism.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.460
And if they continue
to kill innocent people

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
in the name of the law...
Stalker.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.880
...then we will have no choice
but to c--

22:35.880 --> 22:38.330
Do I need to learn how to say
"no means no" in Klingon?

22:38.330 --> 22:40.750
Cute. Look, I saw
the press conference.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.620
You're gonna need a team
of lawyers to win this.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.210
Why should that
include you?

22:44.210 --> 22:46.380
Someone who's made
his romantic interests,

22:46.380 --> 22:48.460
and thus his impartiality,
very clear.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.210
You don't seem too bothered
with your romantic interests.

22:51.210 --> 22:53.670
What?
You expect me to believe
you're not into Annalise?

22:53.670 --> 22:55.420
We are preparing
for a murder trial,

22:55.420 --> 22:56.960
no one's thinking
about who likes who!

22:56.960 --> 22:58.670
So you do like her.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.830
Which is an unhealthy
distraction for a lawyer

23:00.830 --> 23:03.580
about to take on the most
complicated trial of her career.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.080
But it's okay for you
to work on her case?

23:06.080 --> 23:09.170
You're not gonna hire me.
Which, honestly, is quite smart.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.250
I only offered 'cause I wanted
to get closer to Annalise.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.540
Which is why it's
so clear to me

23:12.540 --> 23:14.250
you're doing exactly
the same thing.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.880
Look here, boo boo.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.790
Whatever
girl-on-girl fantasy

23:17.790 --> 23:19.250
you brewed up in
that hetero-head,

23:19.250 --> 23:20.670
it's not gonna happen.

23:20.670 --> 23:22.500
I'm a professional
whose sole focus

23:22.500 --> 23:24.540
is winning this case
for my client.

23:24.540 --> 23:26.000
Who you have a thing for.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.540
Annalise needs
to know that.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.210
Danielle!

23:29.210 --> 23:31.540
Get security to escort Robert
out of the building.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.290
Now.

23:42.210 --> 23:43.250
Talk.

23:43.250 --> 23:44.420
Everything's fine.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.380
What does that mean?

23:48.670 --> 23:50.040
Is he dead?
No.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.460
I'm not an animal.

23:51.460 --> 23:54.380
But all he's fessed up to
is that he hired Pollock.

23:54.380 --> 23:55.880
Says no one else
in the FBI's dirty.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.170
What about the Governor?

23:57.170 --> 23:59.460
I'm about to dig
in on that.
Don't.

23:59.460 --> 24:01.380
This is my courtroom,
I know what I'm doing.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.040
There's another way
to use him, Frank.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.330
So this is why you expanded
your house arrest, huh?

24:14.330 --> 24:17.080
Have somewhere else
to be shady?

24:17.080 --> 24:18.250
We found Xavier.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.290
You don't have to
take my word for it.

24:22.290 --> 24:23.880
You could see him
yourself.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.250
If?

24:26.250 --> 24:30.000
Testify for me,
not against me.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.460
Who told you?
Doesn't matter.

24:31.460 --> 24:34.330
Then I'll go.
Maybe it was
the FBI themselves,

24:34.330 --> 24:36.210
you ever wonder if
they played you?

24:36.210 --> 24:38.620
My immunity deal is set,
Annalise.

24:38.620 --> 24:41.460
Oh, you mean the deal that you
made with the people

24:41.460 --> 24:43.170
who've been hiding Xavier
this whole time?

24:43.170 --> 24:45.960
And who killed Asher?

24:45.960 --> 24:47.620
Did Lanford not tell you?

24:47.620 --> 24:51.210
Gabriel saw Agent Pollock
bludgeon the boy to death.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.250
You calling Lanford?
Yeah, to tell him to add

24:55.250 --> 24:56.790
Xavier's kidnapping
to your indictment.

24:56.790 --> 24:59.250
Why did it take Frank
only hours to find Xavier?

24:59.250 --> 25:00.670
How does that make sense

25:00.670 --> 25:02.580
if Lanford sent
his best agents out there

25:02.580 --> 25:03.750
searching for the man?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.460
I don't know, but I'm gonna
ask Xavier that.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.710
They were all
in on it, Nate!

25:07.710 --> 25:09.540
The FBI, Birkhead...

25:09.540 --> 25:11.540
But now we have
one ready to talk.

25:11.540 --> 25:14.250
And it's the coward who
put a hit on your father.

25:14.250 --> 25:17.000
Now God knows you have every
reason to go out there

25:17.000 --> 25:18.830
and do whatever you want
with that man.

25:18.830 --> 25:21.250
But you'll only get a chance
if you help me.

25:23.170 --> 25:25.380
So pick --

25:25.380 --> 25:27.790
who do you hate more?

25:27.790 --> 25:30.710
Me or the man who
killed your father?

25:43.830 --> 25:45.460
Remember me?

25:51.120 --> 25:53.460
If you're gonna kill me,
do it.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.750
Why would I kill you?

25:55.750 --> 25:58.880
Tell me.
Why would you deserve that?

25:59.670 --> 26:01.170
Okay.

26:02.790 --> 26:05.960
Say it for the record.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.580
Xavier Castillo,

26:07.580 --> 26:11.250
did you order the hit on
Nathaniel Lahey Senior?

26:11.250 --> 26:14.170
You got me under
duress here.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.250
None of this will be
admissible in court.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.880
So that's it?

26:17.880 --> 26:20.750
You're not gonna confess
to killing my pops?

26:20.750 --> 26:24.250
Or confess to working
with the Governor?

26:24.250 --> 26:27.750
If that's what you think,
I'm not gonna change your mind.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.420
No news yet.

26:31.420 --> 26:32.920
You're not in there?

26:32.920 --> 26:34.120
No, I had my time
with the guy.

26:36.330 --> 26:38.420
Did he tell you
where Laurel is?

26:38.420 --> 26:39.710
Hey.

26:39.710 --> 26:41.210
I'm in this with you.

26:41.210 --> 26:42.380
Not Laurel.

26:42.380 --> 26:44.710
To the bitter end.

26:44.710 --> 26:48.460
I love you, you just got
to believe me for once.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.620
I love you too, Frank.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.250
Michaela: What's today's
little secret?

27:00.250 --> 27:02.380
You solve JFK?
Hoffa?

27:02.380 --> 27:04.120
Let's make a trade.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.620
You tell me about
what happened to Sam

27:05.620 --> 27:08.120
and I won't tell Annalise
that you're snitching on her.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.250
What are you
talking about?

27:09.250 --> 27:10.620
You got a deal with the FBI,
that's how

27:10.620 --> 27:11.880
you got Asher's murder charges
dropped against you.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.420
Okay, Asher's not here,

27:13.420 --> 27:15.210
but I will gladly
fight you in his place.

27:15.210 --> 27:16.250
Yeah, that goes
for me, too.

27:16.250 --> 27:17.500
Connor:
We don't have to fight him.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.420
We just have
to go to the FBI

27:19.420 --> 27:22.380
and tell them
what he told us.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.170
Did you hear that, FBI?!

27:24.170 --> 27:28.080
Gabriel thinks that
Agent Pollock killed Asher!

27:28.080 --> 27:31.330
Asher told me Wes
didn't act alone.

27:31.330 --> 27:34.330
Before he died,
he told me that.

27:34.330 --> 27:36.000
Hannah thinks so, too.

27:37.000 --> 27:37.880
Hannah?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.540
My aunt.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.290
You know her.

27:41.290 --> 27:42.880
Hannah:
What's going on here?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.670
Hi. I'm Hannah.

27:45.670 --> 27:47.670
Sam's sister.

27:47.670 --> 27:50.080
Who are all of you?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.120
Hannah's a crazy psycho
who knows nothing.

27:54.120 --> 27:57.620
Why did she and Asher both say
that Wes had help killing Sam?

27:57.620 --> 27:58.670
Asher never said that!

27:58.670 --> 27:59.750
Yes, he did.

27:59.750 --> 28:01.460
It hurts, doesn't it?

28:01.460 --> 28:05.500
Someone you thought
loved you told me that.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.500
Even a lying,
cheating, spiteful Asher

28:07.500 --> 28:09.790
is a better person
than you will ever be.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.210
Now, get out.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.960
We are so screwed.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.210
I know what to do.

28:22.210 --> 28:24.040
Oliver takes a poker
to his head?

28:24.040 --> 28:27.290
No.

28:27.290 --> 28:30.210
But our fathers
aren't gonna like it.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.250
Tegan: I've finally got
some good news.

28:32.250 --> 28:35.620
Clearly a sign to let the dragon
out sooner from now on.

28:35.620 --> 28:37.830
What is it?
Your press
conference worked.

28:37.830 --> 28:40.380
The DOJ Committee wants
to meet us at 3:00.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.670
Today?
I've already written up
my argument.

28:42.670 --> 28:43.920
And, yes, you can read it.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.380
I'm a good partner that way.

28:45.380 --> 28:48.250
Partner in a professional way,
of course.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.540
Right.
I'll call you back.

28:55.170 --> 28:57.420
Good news?

28:57.420 --> 29:01.500
I get to challenge
the death penalty today.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.380
Good, because we know
how you can win.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.420
Gabriel: No, no, i-it's an agent
that I met tonight!

29:12.420 --> 29:13.920
Alright?
Her name is Denise Pollock.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.250
And she was Asher's handler,
and she killed him, I swear.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.710
Why wouldn't you stop her?

29:16.710 --> 29:18.830
He was already dead.

29:18.830 --> 29:20.790
The FBI killed Asher.

29:20.790 --> 29:22.250
This -- This whole thing's
been a set-up.

29:22.250 --> 29:24.290
I already know that.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.170
Well, then why haven't
you used it?

29:26.170 --> 29:28.040
Forced Gabriel to testify.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.000
And put Gabriel's
life at risk?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.080
This proves that the FBI
is conspiring against you!

29:32.080 --> 29:33.580
Is this what
I taught you to be?

29:33.580 --> 29:35.500
Cowards who throw
innocent people under the bus?

29:35.500 --> 29:36.790
You threw Nate under the bus
after Sam!

29:36.790 --> 29:39.170
For you! And God knows
I'm still paying for it.

29:39.170 --> 29:41.580
Look, this recording can get
your whole case dropped.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.790
You should be
thanking us!

29:42.790 --> 29:45.170
No. It gets Asher's
murder charge dropped.

29:45.170 --> 29:46.920
Because apparently
I have informants

29:46.920 --> 29:49.500
who will testify to all
of my other charges.

29:53.540 --> 29:56.250
Come clean.

29:56.250 --> 30:00.170
You're the informants.
Admit it.

30:00.170 --> 30:02.830
Admit that you agreed
to testify against me!

30:02.830 --> 30:04.170
Fine, it's us.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.080
We only signed because
Agent Lanford

30:06.080 --> 30:08.040
used Asher's murder
to coerce us.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.460
And it worked.
We fell for it.

30:09.460 --> 30:10.580
And now we hate ourselves
because,

30:10.580 --> 30:11.580
yeah, you taught us better.

30:11.580 --> 30:12.790
How do I know
this isn't a trap?

30:12.790 --> 30:14.080
That you're not
recording me now?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.710
We're not.
Oh, says the snitch.

30:15.710 --> 30:18.420
This recording can get your
death penalty charges revoked.

30:18.420 --> 30:20.380
And it can help get us
out of our deal.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.170
We won't have to
testify against you.

30:22.170 --> 30:24.540
Everyone wins.

30:24.540 --> 30:28.250
They want to kill you --
and they might.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.580
But that's
why we're here --

30:30.580 --> 30:32.620
because we wouldn't
be able to live with ourselves

30:32.620 --> 30:33.920
if that happened.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.080
We're sorry.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.580
Really, we're sorry.

30:52.790 --> 30:54.210
Reyes:
This is a special session

30:54.210 --> 30:56.750
of the Capital Review Committee,
convened in the matter of

30:56.750 --> 30:58.790
United States
vs. Annalise Keating.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.580
It is
our sole objective here

31:00.580 --> 31:03.670
to assess the AUSA's decision
to seek the death penalty

31:03.670 --> 31:05.580
should Ms. Keating
be found guilty by a jury.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.420
Ms. Price?

31:07.420 --> 31:09.750
Esteemed members
of this committee,

31:09.750 --> 31:12.210
the Department of Justice
has one job --

31:12.210 --> 31:14.250
to ensure public safety

31:14.250 --> 31:16.710
against threats
both foreign and domestic.

31:16.710 --> 31:18.790
Nate: I don't think you're ever
gonna tell me the truth.

31:18.790 --> 31:21.750
So maybe I do kill you.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.540
Come on, Nate.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.420
You and I both know
I'm worth more to you alive

31:26.420 --> 31:27.540
and in a courtroom --

31:31.500 --> 31:33.620
So that's what I'm going
to ask of you today --

31:33.620 --> 31:36.080
to protect my client
from the domestic threat

31:36.080 --> 31:39.920
being waged against her
by the AUSA and FBI.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.830
But why, you might
ask yourselves?

31:41.830 --> 31:43.120
Why would our own government

31:43.120 --> 31:46.830
go out of their way to try
and execute Ms. Keating?

31:46.830 --> 31:48.670
Why would they do that?

31:48.670 --> 31:50.460
Why?

31:50.460 --> 31:53.250
That's the question I've asked
myself this whole time.

31:53.250 --> 31:59.170
Why take such a risk to kill
one defenseless old man?

32:03.210 --> 32:06.210
Don't tell me it was to
take down Annalise Keating.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.710
It was Birkhead's plan.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.040
What plan?

32:12.040 --> 32:15.580
To destroy Keating, discredit
her win at the Supreme Court.

32:15.580 --> 32:18.290
There's gotta be more.

32:20.380 --> 32:22.460
The truth.

32:22.460 --> 32:24.880
Our system reserves
the death penalty for people

32:24.880 --> 32:27.540
who destroy lives
for their own gain.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.960
But my client's the one
whose life has been destroyed.

32:29.960 --> 32:35.120
She's lost her husband,
home, reputation.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.960
Now they want to
take her life, too.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.250
I'll tell you
whatever you want.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.000
The Governor,
she contacted you first?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.380
Yeah. Yeah, she did.
She did.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.210
She knew my father was
in jail because of Keating,

32:47.210 --> 32:49.080
she knew we wanted
to hit back.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.670
And the FBI Agent?

32:50.670 --> 32:52.080
Pollock?

32:52.080 --> 32:54.170
She's Birkhead's, too.
I swear.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.210
Birkhead called
every shot.

32:56.210 --> 32:58.080
Tegan: This is
a malicious prosecution...

32:58.080 --> 33:00.620
Rooted in hatred for how
Ms. Keating has built a career

33:00.620 --> 33:04.170
on challenging our currently
unjust justice system.

33:04.170 --> 33:05.420
So rather
than risk the chance

33:05.420 --> 33:07.460
of Ms. Keating messing
with the status quo,

33:07.460 --> 33:10.290
the FBI and USA
are working together

33:10.290 --> 33:12.830
to pull off a
government-sanctioned execution.

33:12.830 --> 33:16.290
Your father was
just a pawn, Nate.

33:16.290 --> 33:18.290
He didn't deserve it.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.750
But it was Birkhead's call.
Not mine.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.380
He didn't deserve
any of it, I swear.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.380
It was Birkhead's call.

33:30.380 --> 33:32.500
She wanted to prove
that Annalise's win

33:32.500 --> 33:34.330
would put dangerous felons
back on the street.

33:34.330 --> 33:35.750
That cannot be
the only reason.

33:35.750 --> 33:38.170
I swear to God, it is.
That's the only reason.

33:38.170 --> 33:39.500
You're telling me that
all this was politics?!

33:39.500 --> 33:41.920
I'm so sorry, Nate.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.420
I wish he died for
a better reason, I do.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.120
I'll tell the police, the FBI,
whoever you want.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.460
Just please let me live.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.080
No...

33:54.080 --> 33:56.120
Nate...

33:56.120 --> 33:57.960
Whatever you want,
just please let me live, man.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.880
Just let me live.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.290
Nate...

34:02.290 --> 34:04.210
Just let me live.

34:09.460 --> 34:11.540
I'll let Frank decide that.

34:15.330 --> 34:17.380
If Ms. Keating
isn't being targeted,

34:17.380 --> 34:19.790
then this is an
"arbitrary and capricious"

34:19.790 --> 34:21.620
application of
the death penalty.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.830
An informant was murdered,
not to mention A.D.A. Sinclair.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.830
The AUSA hasn't provided
a shred of evidence

34:26.830 --> 34:28.540
tying my client to either
of those deaths!

34:28.540 --> 34:29.880
The Federal Rules
don't require her

34:29.880 --> 34:31.790
to disclose evidence
at this phase.

34:31.790 --> 34:33.250
The burden
is on the government

34:33.250 --> 34:35.290
to supply evidence proving
that this isn't the case.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.170
The fact remains
that Asher Millstone

34:38.170 --> 34:41.250
was allegedly murdered
by your client...

34:41.250 --> 34:43.500
The FBI, they're who
killed that boy.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.500
Forced Gabriel
to testify.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.170
And put Gabriel's
life at risk?

34:47.170 --> 34:50.420
This recording can get your
death penalty charges revoked.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.830
And it can help us
get out of our deal.

34:51.830 --> 34:53.920
We won't have to
testify against you.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.250
Everyone wins.

34:56.250 --> 34:59.080
What evidence do you have
to support your claim

34:59.080 --> 35:01.290
that Mr. Millstone's
murder was committed

35:01.290 --> 35:02.540
in order to frame
your client?

35:02.540 --> 35:04.040
I have evidence,
Madam Chair.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.250
It's a recording.
I can play it for you right now.

35:10.330 --> 35:13.120
Come clean. You're the
informants, admit it.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.540
I'll call you back.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.880
Admit that you agreed
to testify against me!

35:22.880 --> 35:24.830
Michaela: Fine, it's us.

35:24.830 --> 35:26.540
Connor: We only signed because
Agent Lanford

35:26.540 --> 35:28.460
used Asher's murder
to coerce us.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.210
And it worked.
We fell for it.

35:30.210 --> 35:31.120
And now we hate ourselves
because,

35:31.120 --> 35:32.540
yeah, you taught us better.

35:32.540 --> 35:33.500
How do I know
this isn't a trap?

35:33.500 --> 35:34.620
That you're not
recording me now?

35:34.620 --> 35:36.250
We're not.
Oh, says the snitch.

35:36.250 --> 35:39.120
This recording can get your
death penalty charges revoked.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.830
And it can help get us
out of our deal.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.830
We won't have to
testify against you.

35:42.830 --> 35:45.170
Everyone wins.

35:45.170 --> 35:47.920
These voices belong to
Connor Walsh and Michaela Pratt.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.580
They claim that the FBI murdered
Asher Millstone

35:50.580 --> 35:53.290
in order to coerce them into
testifying against me.

35:53.290 --> 35:55.170
We don't know if
this recording is real.

35:55.170 --> 35:56.250
You were part
of the coercion

35:56.250 --> 35:57.830
of these two witnesses,
Ms. Montes.

35:57.830 --> 35:59.750
How can the committee believe
anything that you say?

35:59.750 --> 36:02.000
Counselors, this is not
a judiciary hearing.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.500
Do you need more proof?

36:03.500 --> 36:05.710
Talk to Agent Lanford.
He was their handler.

36:05.710 --> 36:07.880
He can get these two witnesses
in front of you.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.790
Or I can give you
their numbers myself.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.580
-Good, you're home.
-What's going on?

36:21.580 --> 36:23.790
Annalise has a recording
of you two claiming

36:23.790 --> 36:25.670
I coerced you into
testifying against her.

36:25.670 --> 36:27.250
A recording of us?

36:27.250 --> 36:29.080
We'll talk more
at my office.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.710
Do we need to cuff you?

36:39.920 --> 36:41.750
They're almost ready
with a decision.

36:41.750 --> 36:44.000
Let's go.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.880
I don't deserve this.
Of course you don't.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.460
No, but I need you
to know that.

36:48.460 --> 36:50.000
That I didn't kill anyone.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.880
I don't deserve to die.

37:03.540 --> 37:05.420
I never believed
any of it.

37:05.420 --> 37:07.000
But what if they do?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.710
Look here.

37:08.710 --> 37:11.210
Nobody's dying on my watch,
I can promise you that.

37:11.210 --> 37:14.000
No, you can't.
Know how I can?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.790
Because there are very few
people in this horrible world

37:17.790 --> 37:19.920
that make me feel
the way you do.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.250
Like it's all worth it.

37:22.250 --> 37:25.250
Even the pain.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.750
And I'm not saying that because
of how the world sees us.

37:28.750 --> 37:32.170
I'm saying it because
of how you see yourself.

37:32.170 --> 37:35.500
It makes me see myself.

37:35.500 --> 37:39.210
You give a voice to every victim
of the justice system.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.210
It's your legacy.

37:46.670 --> 37:53.710
And the only thing that
has given me real purpose...

37:53.710 --> 37:56.830
in years.

37:56.830 --> 38:01.460
And that's what makes me know in
my gut that nobody can stop us.

38:11.380 --> 38:13.830
Reyes:
We have no authority to judge

38:13.830 --> 38:16.380
the government's allegations
or Ms. Keating's...

38:16.380 --> 38:17.830
Although the recording we heard

38:17.830 --> 38:19.170
suggests a serious failure

38:19.170 --> 38:20.960
within
the Department of Justice.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.040
Ms. Montes, we therefore
recommend an internal review

38:24.040 --> 38:27.120
of how any immunity deal
is reached.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.790
What this committee can decide
is whether or not

38:29.790 --> 38:31.830
the U.S. government
may subject Ms. Keating

38:31.830 --> 38:33.790
to capital punishment.

38:33.790 --> 38:37.500
And it is the determination of
this Committee that it may not.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.710
The death penalty
is officially off the table.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.330
I'm trying to be patient,
but you're scaring me a little.

39:08.330 --> 39:10.120
He confessed.
Said it was all the Governor.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.040
That's good.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.460
He say he'd testify
to that in court?

39:13.460 --> 39:15.880
Nope.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.210
'Cause you didn't ask?

39:18.210 --> 39:20.500
'Cause I took care of it.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.210
Please,
just let me live, man.

39:27.210 --> 39:30.210
Just let me live.

39:30.210 --> 39:31.750
I'll let Frank decide that.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.960
You want my father?
Huh?

39:38.960 --> 39:41.040
Take my father, man.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.620
He told me to do everything
Birkhead said.

39:43.620 --> 39:45.830
The hit on your dad, too.

39:45.830 --> 39:48.380
I just went along
with it, man.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.380
It's my father
you really want.

39:51.380 --> 39:53.750
And I can help you
get to him.

39:53.750 --> 39:55.120
We can get to him.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.960
He'll never even
see it coming.

40:06.290 --> 40:09.290
So you're ready
to lose your own father?

40:09.290 --> 40:10.830
He deserves it.

40:14.330 --> 40:15.620
I agree.

40:18.830 --> 40:21.210
So let's hurt him.

40:24.540 --> 40:26.250
Frank: What did you do?

40:28.380 --> 40:30.880
Nate, what the hell
did you do?

40:30.880 --> 40:32.710
What did you do?

40:42.040 --> 40:46.580
Okay. I'm not feeling too bad
about the house arrest anymore.

40:46.580 --> 40:49.500
You said that you knew something
that could help me.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
Only if you're willing
to protect Gabriel.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.670
I already
protected him.
How?

40:53.670 --> 40:55.790
I have a recording
of Gabriel admitting

40:55.790 --> 40:57.960
that he saw the FBI
kill Asher.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.170
I could've played it
at my hearing

40:59.170 --> 41:00.290
at the
Department of Justice.

41:00.290 --> 41:01.750
I didn't.

41:01.750 --> 41:05.460
Instead, I protected him --
for you.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.830
For now.

41:07.830 --> 41:09.920
Listen, Vivian,

41:09.920 --> 41:12.540
there's a lot of people I want
to hurt in this world.

41:12.540 --> 41:14.830
Right now,
you're not one of 'em.

41:17.750 --> 41:20.380
I know who started
the war against you.

41:20.380 --> 41:22.920
And it wasn't the FBI,
or the Governor...

41:24.960 --> 41:27.500
Hannah?
You know?

41:27.500 --> 41:30.000
Hannah hating me
isn't news, Vivian.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.620
But do you know
why she hates you?

41:31.620 --> 41:33.080
Because she's
a sad, lonely bitch

41:33.080 --> 41:34.880
who thinks I killed
her brother.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.580
So you don't know.

41:36.580 --> 41:37.580
Know what?

41:39.620 --> 41:41.540
What happened
with her and Sam.
