WEBVTT

00:07.500 --> 00:09.290
Hey, how'd your date go last night?

00:09.290 --> 00:13.230
It depends, if a guy bites his
cuticles and then swallows them,

00:13.230 --> 00:14.469
does that make him a cannibal?

00:14.469 --> 00:16.213
Because then I had an
exciting date with a cannibal

00:16.309 --> 00:19.040
and not a boring evening with a
guy who has a disgusting habit.

00:19.945 --> 00:22.221
Zing-bang! I'm getting an award.

00:22.441 --> 00:23.320
Bang-zoom! I'm getting a muffin.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.532
Every year the Veridian
charitable foundation

00:25.532 --> 00:27.383
honors someone who's been outstanding,

00:27.383 --> 00:29.701
and this year, they've
chosen me. For what?

00:30.513 --> 00:32.545
- For being outstanding.
- For being outstanding at what?

00:32.545 --> 00:35.079
I'm getting an award.

00:35.579 --> 00:36.969
You realize, as an honoree,
you're gonna have to raise

00:36.969 --> 00:40.250
- a bunch of money for the foundation?
- I know. That's the part I'm dreading.

00:40.528 --> 00:43.611
Linda, you do it for me.
Huh. That wasn't so bad.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.749
Before I agree to do
something I have no choice in,

00:45.749 --> 00:48.307
do you even know which charity
Veridian's giving the money to?

00:48.943 --> 00:51.038
I'm getting an award.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.097
Teddy!

00:53.097 --> 00:56.537
Billy? What are you doing here? Hey.

00:56.537 --> 00:59.280
I'm in town for a couple days.
I thought we could grab a bite.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.197
Hey, are those fresh nuts?

01:01.197 --> 01:02.632
Booyah!

01:02.632 --> 01:03.831
Oh!

01:04.522 --> 01:06.810
Hello, ladies. Don't be
alarmed. I'm Ted's big brother.

01:07.653 --> 01:09.369
You okay, buddy? Huh?

01:09.369 --> 01:11.142
Oh, you gonna barf? It's okay if you do.

01:11.142 --> 01:13.465
- No one will judge.
- Help me up.

01:13.495 --> 01:14.071
Oh, right. Right.

01:14.071 --> 01:17.622
So you can viciously do to me
what I so lovingly did to you?

01:17.622 --> 01:19.750
No. I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm not a jackass like you.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.034
This is where I work. Oh.

01:23.744 --> 01:25.335
- Right.
- Sack attack!

01:25.335 --> 01:25.748
Yeah! Yeah!

01:26.183 --> 01:28.555
- Excellent.
- I totally got you. I totally got him.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.730
Yes it was masterful,
like watching a chess game.

01:40.342 --> 01:42.376
Hey, Ted, I can't find Rose,

01:42.376 --> 01:43.527
and I've looked for her everywhere.

01:43.567 --> 01:46.711
- I'm upside down!
- Well, I know one thing for sure...

01:46.711 --> 01:48.684
wherever she is, she's right side up.

01:48.684 --> 01:50.664
No, I'm not.

01:50.664 --> 01:52.481
Well, until we find her,
we're gonna have to just use

01:52.481 --> 01:55.233
this spare Rose that we got
growing out of your back.

01:55.233 --> 01:56.171
- Oh, come here.
- What?

01:56.171 --> 02:00.325
That was fun. I'm gonna go
see if it made me any taller.

02:01.335 --> 02:03.821
Hey, it's great having you around.

02:04.355 --> 02:05.658
Yeah. You know, Rose doesn't
have a lot of family here.

02:06.674 --> 02:09.282
Oh, relax. I'm not setting you
up. So how long can you stay?

02:09.282 --> 02:11.267
I don't know, a couple of days.
I heard there might be a job

02:11.267 --> 02:13.190
out in Fresno, selling
baby-proofing kits.

02:13.190 --> 02:14.323
Apparently, they're having problems

02:14.323 --> 02:15.824
with babies breaking
into homes out there.

02:15.888 --> 02:18.402
What happened to selling boxes?
And... and could you please stop

02:18.402 --> 02:21.456
- holding mom in front of your crotch? -
Well, I kind of had a falling-out with my boss

02:21.456 --> 02:22.913
'cause I kept sleeping with his wife.

02:23.779 --> 02:24.850
It's a real shame,
too, 'cause I sold boxes

02:24.850 --> 02:28.948
- even better than I sold attack dogs or fatty scooters.
- Aw, man, you're a great salesman.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.139
I was kinda hoping that job would stick.

02:30.139 --> 02:32.366
Hey, what if I got you
something at Veridian?

02:32.366 --> 02:34.802
Seriously? Man, I'd love that.

02:34.802 --> 02:36.644
Plus, I'd get to hang here for a while.

02:36.644 --> 02:38.861
Yeah, Rose and I would like that, too.

02:38.861 --> 02:41.888
I love you, bro, but not
like in a brotherly way.

02:41.888 --> 02:43.276
No, it's all about the sex for me.

02:43.276 --> 02:44.541
Don't pretend you don't want it.

02:44.541 --> 02:46.532
You've been thinking about
it all night, like I have.

02:46.532 --> 02:50.946
- So I'm coming in for a kiss. Don't try and fight it.
- Oh, you've definitely picked up my signals.

02:50.946 --> 02:53.237
Why don't we just skip
right to second base?

02:53.700 --> 02:55.321
Where's your mommy now, huh?

02:55.321 --> 02:57.426
Aw, too easy!

02:59.212 --> 03:00.959
Ted, the next morning, I asked Veronica

03:00.959 --> 03:03.207
if she thought it'd be possible
to get Billy a job at Veridian.

03:03.207 --> 03:06.696
- I'm getting an award.
- When I finally got Veronica's attention,

03:06.696 --> 03:08.393
she told me Veridian wasn't hiring,

03:08.393 --> 03:10.060
so I talked to Lou,

03:10.060 --> 03:13.438
- the owner of the company that sells us our lab supplies.
- I don't know, Ted.

03:13.438 --> 03:16.552
I got an idiot brother of my
own I'm not giving a job to.

03:16.552 --> 03:21.329
- Billy's not an idiot. He's a really good salesman.
- Actually, Ted, I'm a really good salesman.

03:21.329 --> 03:23.736
I just figured out a way to
sell Veridian 3,000 beakers

03:23.736 --> 03:24.794
I've been having trouble getting rid of.

03:28.961 --> 03:30.982
So I got Billy can job
selling lab supplies.

03:30.982 --> 03:32.810
And you know that saying...

03:32.810 --> 03:33.622
"you can never have too many beakers"?

03:33.622 --> 03:35.850
Well, it's not a saying,
and now I know why.

03:36.377 --> 03:39.332
Hey, Lonnie. Great job on that
presentation. Have a beaker.

03:39.332 --> 03:40.695
No, thank you.

03:43.977 --> 03:46.701
- I didn't know Ted had a brother.
- I did. I did all that research

03:46.701 --> 03:48.264
when I dressed up as Ted
for Halloween last year.

03:48.786 --> 03:49.585
Did you know

03:49.585 --> 03:52.440
- his great-grandfather was a
cattle wrestler? - You mean rustler.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.620
No, wrestler. He used
to go from town to town

03:54.620 --> 03:58.252
- fighting livestock for beer money.
- I had an aunt who fought a cow for beer money once.

03:58.252 --> 04:01.547
- The cow never forgave her.
- Oh, they're very unforgiving.

04:01.547 --> 04:04.073
- What are they doing?
- Oh, it's just how they process information.

04:04.073 --> 04:05.409
Anyway, fellas,

04:05.409 --> 04:06.950
so Billy is the new rep

04:06.950 --> 04:08.645
for the company that
supplies our lab equipment.

04:08.645 --> 04:10.319
Anything you need, you go through him.

04:10.319 --> 04:14.232
- And this is the latest catalog.
- Oh, you dropped something, Theodore.

04:14.910 --> 04:16.510
Pick it up, Theo-dorable.

04:16.591 --> 04:19.200
- I'm not picking it up,
Billy-has-a-little-Willy. - Oh!

04:19.200 --> 04:22.144
- What are they doing?
- That's just how they process emotion.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.797
Run, dummy. It's getting away.

04:26.092 --> 04:27.923
All right, I'll see you at home later.

04:27.923 --> 04:29.240
Don't be late. I'm making lasagna.

04:30.384 --> 04:31.520
All right.

04:33.676 --> 04:35.597
Please don't hurt us.
We're not like you.

04:35.729 --> 04:36.964
No, I'm not gonna hurt ya.

04:37.518 --> 04:39.810
Okay, so, uh, what kind
of stuff you guys need?

04:40.278 --> 04:42.605
Nothing currently. We're pretty
careful with our resources.

04:42.605 --> 04:46.077
Although we once meant to
buy 6 4-inch Petri dishes

04:46.077 --> 04:48.737
and instead bought 4
6-inch Petri dishes.

04:50.696 --> 04:52.475
It was crazy how slightly
bigger it was than we needed.

04:52.475 --> 04:54.430
Ahh! Uh, okay.

04:54.430 --> 04:56.108
You guys need to loosen up a little,

04:56.108 --> 04:59.608
so I am gonna take you
to a very exclusive club.

04:59.608 --> 05:02.267
We're gonna have a drink,
talk about lab supplies.

05:02.267 --> 05:05.501
Well, we can't leave work-in
the middle of the day.

05:05.501 --> 05:06.783
We're not Somali pirates.

05:06.783 --> 05:09.750
You know, if you get little
crazy once in a while,

05:10.031 --> 05:11.688
you stop being scared
of living your life...

05:12.755 --> 05:14.021
That's when things get interesting.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.893
I have always harbored ambitions

05:16.893 --> 05:18.239
of being slightly more pirate-like.

05:19.003 --> 05:20.777
And we did look pretty
cool with those eye patches

05:20.777 --> 05:21.578
when we both had pink eye.

05:22.598 --> 05:24.745
Okay, Ted's brother, we're in.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.545
I did a little research on the charity

05:32.545 --> 05:35.132
- the Veridian foundation is giving the money to.
- Why?

05:35.132 --> 05:37.403
- Because I wanted to know where the money was going.
- Why?

05:37.403 --> 05:39.982
- Because I wanted to make sure it was a good cause.
- Why?

05:39.982 --> 05:41.509
Because I don't have

05:41.509 --> 05:42.278
a debilitating personality disorder

05:42.278 --> 05:44.349
that keeps me from
caring about anything.

05:44.349 --> 05:48.269
- First of all, it's not debilitating. It's liberating...
- The money is going to a great charity

05:48.269 --> 05:50.249
that provides female mentors
for underprivileged girls,

05:50.249 --> 05:51.559
preparing them for leadership positions.

05:51.559 --> 05:55.592
- Ha! Your consciousness has been raised, lady.
- That sounds wonderful.

05:55.592 --> 05:58.261
- Ugh. I hate it when you mock me.
- I'm serious.

05:58.261 --> 05:59.700
And when you mock me for pointing out

05:59.700 --> 06:01.446
- that you're mocking me.
- I'm not mocking you.

06:01.446 --> 06:03.507
And when you mockingly
insist you're not mocking me.

06:03.507 --> 06:06.579
Seriously, this is actually
a cause I can relate to.

06:07.309 --> 06:09.365
A female mentor would
have been very valuable

06:09.365 --> 06:12.467
for a young Veronica, who
was bursting with potential,

06:12.467 --> 06:14.438
yet vulnerable, like
a fawn in the woods,

06:14.438 --> 06:17.274
but tough, like a fawn in
the woods with a machine gun.

06:17.274 --> 06:21.038
So you're saying you, or this
terrifying, murderous fawn,

06:21.038 --> 06:22.107
could have used some guidance?

06:22.107 --> 06:23.914
Yes, we would have liked that.

06:23.914 --> 06:27.227
You and I are gonna raise
more money for this charity

06:27.227 --> 06:28.825
than it's ever raised before.

06:28.825 --> 06:32.062
The forest will run red with
the blood of woodland creatures

06:32.062 --> 06:33.585
who doubted little Veronica

06:33.585 --> 06:36.274
and will now pay with
their furry little lives.

06:36.274 --> 06:38.174
There's really no
middle ground with you.

06:38.174 --> 06:41.261
Either you don't care at all
or you care 100-and-crazy%.

06:41.261 --> 06:42.545
What else is there?

06:42.545 --> 06:47.014
Now saddle up, Linda, and
say good-bye to common sense.

06:50.165 --> 06:52.653
Final call. Flight 25 now departing...

06:52.653 --> 06:56.030
Wow. I've heard about clubs
like these at airports,

06:56.030 --> 06:58.443
but I always thought you had
to be an admiral to get in.

06:58.443 --> 06:59.821
Well, look around, boys.

06:59.821 --> 07:02.635
Full bar, cheeses,
nuts... and it's all free.

07:02.635 --> 07:04.563
Welcome to Shangri-La.

07:04.563 --> 07:07.746
This place is amazing.
I never want to leave.

07:07.746 --> 07:09.203
- We should go.
- We have to go.

07:10.653 --> 07:13.286
Oh, my God. There's a
pilot. That guy's a hero.

07:13.286 --> 07:15.343
Fine. We'll go over, give
him one salute, then leave.

07:15.343 --> 07:18.514
- If we're gone from work too long, we'll get in trouble.
- Ah, so what if you do?

07:18.514 --> 07:20.427
So someone gets mad at you. Who cares?

07:20.427 --> 07:22.582
You know what I do when
someone gets in my face?

07:22.582 --> 07:24.904
I tell 'em to deal with it.

07:26.265 --> 07:27.513
"Deal with it."

07:27.513 --> 07:29.394
God, that'd be a cool thing
to say to somebody sometime.

07:29.972 --> 07:31.683
Why not today? Why not right now?

07:33.148 --> 07:35.777
- Hey, you, deal with it.
- Yeah, deal with it.

07:36.838 --> 07:39.178
I'm getting me a damn cube of cheese!

07:39.178 --> 07:41.490
Can we take our pants off in here?

07:41.490 --> 07:42.193
Easy.

07:44.413 --> 07:46.278
I have to justify to accounting
buying so many beakers.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.873
But I'm helping my brother
get his life back on track,

07:48.873 --> 07:50.071
and now people will know

07:50.071 --> 07:51.457
how many milliliters
of pencils they have.

07:52.579 --> 07:54.223
Oh, excuse me. And...

07:54.223 --> 07:57.369
they make great coffee mugs.

07:59.779 --> 08:00.987
Surprise.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.418
I got you guys 600 beakers.

08:02.418 --> 08:04.482
I was thinking you could
use them for beakers.

08:06.578 --> 08:07.427
What's that?

08:07.427 --> 08:10.012
- Just a bag full of something.
- A bag full of what?

08:10.012 --> 08:13.612
- Just a 62-year-old white male. - We
bought a cadaver from your brother, Ted.

08:14.311 --> 08:15.502
- Deal with it.
- Yeah, deal with it.

08:16.273 --> 08:18.521
For God sakes, why
would you buy a cadaver?

08:18.521 --> 08:20.789
Well, we were being all boring
and ordering stuff we needed

08:20.789 --> 08:23.510
when we decided to grow a pair
and do something totally loco,

08:23.510 --> 08:26.220
- so we bought it.
- No, not "it." "It" implies one.

08:26.220 --> 08:30.255
- Oh, man. What did you guys do?
- Thanks to Billy, one of these will arrive every month.

08:30.255 --> 08:32.894
That's right, once a month
they send us a new cadaver,

08:32.894 --> 08:35.993
- whether we're finished with the old one or not.
- And what are you geniuses gonna do

08:35.993 --> 08:37.933
when dead bodies start
stacking up in here?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.251
We're gonna deal with it, Ted,

08:39.251 --> 08:42.443
- just like you're gonna deal with it.
- Yeah, everyone's dealing with things now, Ted.

08:42.443 --> 08:44.518
Mm-hmm. Well, I gotta go yell at Billy.

08:44.518 --> 08:45.900
And I know you guys.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.897
Don't name that corpse,
because it's going back.

08:53.234 --> 08:54.390
So who are we hitting up next?

08:54.390 --> 08:56.132
We're at Fleming in marketing.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.112
We're gonna get 500
bucks from this mutt.

08:58.626 --> 09:01.898
- Can I be the bad cop this time?
- Linda, I've seen you smile when you cry

09:01.898 --> 09:03.113
and skip when you're upset.

09:03.113 --> 09:04.716
I don't think that's a good fit.

09:05.835 --> 09:07.960
Hey, Brett. Can I get you
anything? Are you comfortable?

09:07.960 --> 09:10.535
Of course he's comfortable...
comfortable being a sack of crap

09:10.535 --> 09:14.459
- who doesn't give a damn about girls who need mentors.
- Veronica and I are raising money for a very good cause.

09:14.459 --> 09:17.232
- We left you that brochure, but you never got back to us.
- Shut up, Brett.

09:17.232 --> 09:22.298
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh, that's rich. We're gonna need $10,000 from you.

09:22.298 --> 09:24.630
$10,000? That's...
that's... that's crazy.

09:24.630 --> 09:27.424
Crazy? What's crazy is
Gina Morales not having

09:27.424 --> 09:29.735
an experienced businesswoman
to help her write a letter

09:29.735 --> 09:31.817
to get into college.
That's what's crazy.

09:31.817 --> 09:33.167
Whoa, Veronica, easy.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.347
Gina's problems aren't
entirely Brett's fault.

09:35.347 --> 09:36.233
You need to cool off.

09:36.541 --> 09:39.183
Fine. I'll go get 200
milliliters of coffee.

09:42.966 --> 09:45.230
I'm sorry. It's just...
she loves those damn kids.

09:45.230 --> 09:47.952
Look, you're a nice guy.

09:47.952 --> 09:50.859
Let me try to talk Veronica
into taking just 500 bucks.

09:50.859 --> 09:52.958
- Oh, man. Would you do that?
- Yeah.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.419
But if you tell anybody
I did you a solid,

09:55.419 --> 09:57.649
I will tear off your head
and tinkle in your skull!

09:58.978 --> 10:00.720
I'm just kidding.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.219
But, yeah, I'm dangerous.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.681
Billy, you here?

10:07.999 --> 10:09.470
Yes, and we have company.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.249
I invited the lobsters for dinner.

10:11.249 --> 10:14.226
But don't say anything. I plan
on killing and eating them.

10:14.226 --> 10:15.585
We are celebrating.

10:15.585 --> 10:19.833
- I racked up some great commissions at work today.
- Uh, yeah, a... about that, Lem and Phil...

10:19.833 --> 10:22.203
they don't need a year's
supply of cadavers or even one.

10:23.407 --> 10:25.528
Oh, wow. I don't know
if it's returnable.

10:25.528 --> 10:27.624
Well, it's... it's... it's not
like we used it or anything.

10:27.624 --> 10:31.871
- I mean, it still has that new-dead-guy smell. - Oh,
yeah. It's... it's just that my boss was so impressed.

10:31.871 --> 10:33.494
But, hey, if it's a problem for you,

10:33.494 --> 10:37.507
- I'll just tell him that he's gotta deal with it.
- Yeah. Well, bosses love hearing that.

10:37.986 --> 10:40.454
Daddy! Uncle Billy bought
me a bunch of presents.

10:40.454 --> 10:43.513
And best of all, he said he
might live here for a while.

10:43.513 --> 10:47.125
Oh! Now hold on. That's
only if the job works out.

10:50.532 --> 10:52.497
Hey, listen. Forget
about returning that thing

10:52.497 --> 10:54.294
we were talking about.
I'll figure something out.

10:54.776 --> 10:57.560
- Yeah, yeah. Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want to reject your body.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.474
You got enough of that from
every girl in high school.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.744
And, dad, watch this. Hey, uncle silly.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.450
Come here, you!

11:07.289 --> 11:08.686
Oh!

11:10.872 --> 11:11.449
I convinced Lonnie,

11:11.449 --> 11:13.671
the odd guy who works in
the oddly cold computer room,

11:13.671 --> 11:14.895
to keep the cadaver for a while.

11:15.994 --> 11:17.024
It might be a little creepy at first,

11:17.024 --> 11:20.281
but the cadaver will get used to him.

11:21.688 --> 11:24.196
Hi. So you must be from that charity

11:24.196 --> 11:25.409
that the Veridian
foundation's working with.

11:25.409 --> 11:28.388
Yes. We're going to visit
the honoree, Veronica Palmer.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.157
Some of the girls are a little nervous.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.489
They've never been in a big,
corporate environment before.

11:32.489 --> 11:35.070
Oh, don't be afraid. Just
don't go to the fourth floor.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.521
That's where we keep
the monster factory.

11:36.521 --> 11:39.314
I'm just kidding.

11:39.314 --> 11:41.860
But, seriously, stay
clear of the fourth floor.

11:42.926 --> 11:44.658
Ted, I was just coming to see you.

11:44.658 --> 11:46.412
There's a new rule in the computer room.

11:46.412 --> 11:47.818
They just came up with it today...

11:47.818 --> 11:51.094
"No dead bodies in the computer room."

11:56.566 --> 11:57.629
can you believe it?

11:57.629 --> 11:59.652
You bought those leather
pants you've always wanted.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.063
My wife doesn't know I'm not at work.

12:01.063 --> 12:02.755
Is there any rule we haven't broken?

12:02.755 --> 12:05.323
These pants make my legs feel so cool.

12:05.323 --> 12:07.254
I can't believe my lower
half's letting my upper half

12:07.254 --> 12:09.824
- hang out with it.
- Hey. The people over at the beverage station

12:09.824 --> 12:13.098
- are pissed 'cause you guys drank all the pineapple juice.
- Deal with it!

12:13.098 --> 12:15.329
Deal with it! So let's order

12:15.329 --> 12:17.124
some ridiculously
expensive lab equipment

12:17.124 --> 12:19.744
- we've never had the nerve to buy before.
- Uh, maybe we should just stick

12:19.744 --> 12:22.948
- with the stuff you guys need this time.
- If we stuck with the stuff we needed,

12:22.948 --> 12:26.035
- I never would have bought these fiercely uncomfortable pants.
- And I wouldn't have squeezed

12:26.035 --> 12:28.418
ten cubes of cheese into a
ball and eaten it like an apple,

12:28.418 --> 12:32.212
which I should not have done,
but I am dealing with it.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.375
I just had a disturbing conversation

12:37.375 --> 12:39.212
with Mrs. Boudreaux
from the girls charity.

12:39.212 --> 12:41.007
Apparently Ted threw a dead body at her.

12:41.007 --> 12:43.349
- Oh, my God!
- Well, that's not the disturbing part.

12:43.349 --> 12:45.066
In fact, I find that part deeply funny.

12:45.066 --> 12:47.410
What's disturbing is,
the Veridian foundation

12:47.410 --> 12:49.382
keeps 95% of the money we raise

12:49.382 --> 12:53.125
- and only gives 5% to the girls charity.
- Really? That's horrible.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.519
We need to talk to Mr. Page,
the head of the foundation.

12:55.519 --> 12:58.036
It's time for this fawn
to strap on a machine gun,

12:58.036 --> 13:02.595
- spread its wings and fly.
- Okay, what exactly do you think a fawn is?

13:05.245 --> 13:06.802
The purpose of the
Veridian foundation, girls,

13:06.802 --> 13:09.812
is to let the world know of
the good works Veridian does.

13:09.812 --> 13:12.134
So you spent 95 cents of every dollar

13:12.134 --> 13:13.994
telling the world
about the other 5 cents?

13:14.744 --> 13:16.051
If thousands of trees are
clear-cut in the forest

13:16.051 --> 13:17.569
and nobody hears about
it, did it really happen?

13:17.569 --> 13:18.671
Of course it did, sugar,

13:18.671 --> 13:21.373
and people always find out
about it, so what we need to do

13:21.373 --> 13:23.446
is publicize the occasional
good thing the company does

13:23.446 --> 13:27.102
- so that people are aware of how wonderful we appear to be.
- This isn't about some stupid trees.

13:27.102 --> 13:29.622
These girls are living, growing things,

13:29.622 --> 13:33.369
and you're trying to hold
them back. Gina Morales!

13:33.369 --> 13:35.127
Hey, Mr. Page.

13:35.127 --> 13:37.774
- Can I get you anything? Are you comfortable?
- We're not doing that.

13:37.774 --> 13:39.826
You're gonna give everything
we collected to that charity.

13:39.826 --> 13:41.633
People suffered for that money.

13:41.633 --> 13:43.288
We were awful.

13:43.288 --> 13:44.616
You know what's funny?

13:44.616 --> 13:47.159
We raise money to help little
girls enter the business world,

13:47.159 --> 13:50.518
and when they finally do, they
still act like little girls.

13:50.518 --> 13:52.375
I'll need the donations
you've collected by tomorrow.

13:52.375 --> 13:54.175
Now if you'll excuse me, girls...

13:54.175 --> 13:57.604
No. We're not done here.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.885
This woman opened her heart,

13:59.885 --> 14:02.565
and that happens so rarely, you
could hear the hinges squeak.

14:02.565 --> 14:06.766
- I will not let you slam that Rusty heart door shut.
- Go, Linda. Release your anger.

14:06.766 --> 14:09.223
You will not crush this
woman's spirit and love,

14:09.223 --> 14:11.208
you spineless, condescending bureaucrat.

14:11.208 --> 14:14.063
Good, Linda. Only your
hatred can destroy him.

14:14.063 --> 14:16.498
You, sir, are a bad egg.

14:16.498 --> 14:17.806
Yes! Now strike!

14:21.841 --> 14:22.970
Wow.

14:24.492 --> 14:26.053
Where did that come from?

14:26.053 --> 14:27.954
am a good mentor.

14:31.852 --> 14:33.899
Okay, I need you guys to
lower the temperature in here.

14:34.095 --> 14:37.945
- Watch this dude until I figure out what to do with him.
- And you need to put more money in our lab supplies account.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.872
- What did you do?
- We bought a small family of robots.

14:40.872 --> 14:45.361
- And a large wind tunnel.
- We want to see how long it takes to drive robots crazy with wind.

14:45.361 --> 14:46.909
Deal with it, deal with it!

14:46.909 --> 14:49.948
Okay, how's this... what if I
tell Veronica that you've burned

14:49.948 --> 14:51.962
through the company's
money, she notifies H.R.,

14:51.962 --> 14:54.173
they open an investigation,
and you guys lose your job?

14:54.173 --> 14:55.652
Does that count as "dealing with it"?

14:59.668 --> 15:01.513
My legs are completely numb.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.679
Only the tightness of my
pants is holding me up.

15:03.679 --> 15:06.712
I think I feel that cheese
apple making its way North.

15:09.704 --> 15:11.767
Billy, call me. It's about Lem and Phil.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.386
And you shouldn't say
"doody" so many times

15:13.386 --> 15:16.528
- in your outgoing message. What if mom calls?
- Ted, we need your help.

15:16.528 --> 15:18.952
- Ted, we don't need your help.
- Guys, I'm kind of in the middle of something.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.359
- My brother has pushed Phil and Lem off the rails.
- I went crazy in a meeting

15:22.359 --> 15:26.667
- and headbutted the president of the Veridian foundation.
- That wasn't crazy. It was deeply funny.

15:26.667 --> 15:30.124
- It was kind of cool. His head made a "boop" sound.
- Boop.

15:31.024 --> 15:32.863
After that, we were so pumped
up... and a little dizzy...

15:32.863 --> 15:34.628
that instead of giving
the foundation guy

15:34.628 --> 15:36.619
the money we collected, we
drove down to the girls charity

15:36.619 --> 15:39.393
- and gave it all to them.
- It was incredibly satisfying.

15:39.393 --> 15:41.989
Until we found out that
collecting donations from people

15:41.989 --> 15:44.523
and then giving them to whoever
you want is a class 2 felony.

15:44.523 --> 15:46.862
Well, look, why don't you just
go back to the foundation guy,

15:46.862 --> 15:49.419
tell him you got a
little carried away and...

15:49.419 --> 15:50.807
Oh, wait. You booped him.

15:50.807 --> 15:52.871
- Ding!
- Wah wah!

15:52.871 --> 15:54.803
- Have you guys been drinking?
- Little bit.

15:55.683 --> 15:57.407
Please, Ted. I can't go to jail.

15:57.407 --> 15:59.195
You have to talk to
that foundation weasel

15:59.195 --> 16:02.495
- and ask him very nicely to let us off the hook.
- Screw that.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.318
Tell him we'll see him in
court and then headbutt him.

16:04.318 --> 16:08.405
- Headbutt him hard. Crack that egg.
- Okay, I will go try and straighten this out.

16:08.405 --> 16:10.083
While I'm gone, I want you two to think

16:10.083 --> 16:11.179
about what you'd rather
have for Christmas...

16:11.507 --> 16:14.369
a wind tunnel, a family
of robots or a corpse.

16:18.068 --> 16:20.219
Screw those girls, man.
Okay? You know what? They took

16:20.219 --> 16:21.703
my foundation money and they
gave it to some stupid charity.

16:21.703 --> 16:23.300
Plus, they headbutted me.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.794
And then they poured
themselves a nice little drink.

16:24.794 --> 16:27.827
And then the one with the bun on
her head... oh, she stood over me

16:27.827 --> 16:29.157
while she posed for
a picture doing this.

16:29.157 --> 16:31.518
What the hell was that? You
better get the money back

16:31.518 --> 16:32.801
from the charity or
they're going to jail.

16:32.801 --> 16:34.929
Oh, you a lot of nerve coming in here,

16:34.929 --> 16:40.390
- Some nerve. Some nerve.
- He did not like being headbutted and then posed over.

16:40.390 --> 16:44.714
Hey. Hey, man. I... I got your
message. Are you pissed at me?

16:44.714 --> 16:47.690
Yes, Billy, I am pissed at you.
I told you that I had a problem

16:47.690 --> 16:49.553
with you selling Phil and
Lem stuff they didn't need,

16:49.553 --> 16:51.842
- and you did it anyway.
- No. I... I held back, okay?

16:51.842 --> 16:53.160
The robot family normally
comes with grandparents,

16:53.160 --> 16:56.550
- but they're sitting heartbroken back at the warehouse.
- So I'm supposed to thank you

16:56.550 --> 17:00.943
- for creating a huge mess instead of a gigantic one?
- Well, just say it, Ted. What's your problem?

17:00.943 --> 17:03.530
I have been cleaning up after
you since we were kids, Billy.

17:03.530 --> 17:06.438
You bring home a stray possum,
I'm the one that has to walk it,

17:06.438 --> 17:08.544
which, by the way, is impossible
because they play dead,

17:08.544 --> 17:11.951
- and you end up just having to drag it down the street.
- I was gonna train it to drive a golf cart

17:11.951 --> 17:15.080
- so that we could be on "that's incredible!"
- Yeah, but you didn't. So I'm the one

17:15.080 --> 17:17.473
that ended up with a weird pet
that I have to take to college.

17:17.473 --> 17:20.859
Billy, I am still cleaning up
after you. You can't keep a job.

17:20.859 --> 17:23.928
- 3,000 beakers later, I got you one.
- Yeah, which I'm trying to be good at.

17:24.776 --> 17:26.896
- Isn't that what you want?
- You know what? I can't even talk to you right now.

17:26.896 --> 17:28.323
Veronica and Linda are in real trouble

17:28.323 --> 17:29.832
with this jerk from
the Veridian foundation,

17:29.977 --> 17:31.436
so now I gotta go clean up that mess.

17:31.436 --> 17:34.197
And by the way, do
you know how many times

17:34.197 --> 17:35.032
I didn't get laid in college

17:35.032 --> 17:37.299
because girls don't like getting
hissed at by a jealous possum?

17:44.489 --> 17:45.870
Now I... I know it's
not customary for...

17:45.870 --> 17:48.141
for charities to give
money back to their donors,

17:48.141 --> 17:50.843
but if you like helping
girls, I know two who would

17:50.843 --> 17:53.431
really be helped if you returned
all the money they gave to you.

17:54.146 --> 17:56.286
Do you know how crazy you
sound right now, young man?

17:56.286 --> 17:58.659
Crazy or really on to something?

18:04.357 --> 18:06.874
Well, I just got told to go screw myself

18:06.874 --> 18:08.200
by a 60-year-o
woman.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.785
Brought me back to when I was 10

18:09.785 --> 18:11.278
when I asked grandma why
her house smelled funny.

18:11.278 --> 18:14.379
- What are you doing here?
- Teddy, you are gonna kiss us.

18:15.592 --> 18:16.987
We got Veronica and Linda off the hook.

18:16.987 --> 18:19.997
- What?
- You said you were having a problem with that page guy

18:19.997 --> 18:22.121
from the foundation, so
me and these two roughnecks

18:22.121 --> 18:26.995
- thought we'd help you out.
- We documented the whole thing. First we got the corpse...

18:26.995 --> 18:28.905
Who we named "Roger." I know
you said not to name him,

18:28.905 --> 18:32.765
- but as you know, we haven't been listening to you lately.
- Then we put the corpse in the trunk of page's car.

18:34.348 --> 18:37.627
- Oh, guys, no, no, no.
- Uh, Roger did not want to get in at first.

18:37.627 --> 18:38.675
You know, he went all floppy,

18:38.675 --> 18:41.427
- like, "oh, no, don't put me in there."
- Classic Roger.

18:41.427 --> 18:43.320
Then we put a nail in page's tire

18:44.596 --> 18:45.908
and followed him after work.

18:45.908 --> 18:48.226
Eventually, his tire went flat,
and he pulled over to change it.

18:48.226 --> 18:51.109
- Page went looking for his spare.
- That's when Roger leapt into action.

18:51.109 --> 18:53.431
- Page opened the trunk, and hello, dead guy.
- Roger.

18:53.431 --> 18:56.540
Then like a textbook douche,
he did what douches do...

18:56.540 --> 18:58.780
rather then complicate his
life for a single minute,

18:58.780 --> 19:02.309
he dumped the body by the side of the road.
Then we followed him and showed him the pictures.

19:02.309 --> 19:06.084
- He agreed it'd be better if they weren't posted on the Internet.
- And so he decided

19:06.084 --> 19:08.887
to look the other way
with Veronica and Linda.

19:08.887 --> 19:12.375
- Unbelievable.
- Just so you know, this was our last hurrah.

19:12.375 --> 19:16.130
Lem and I are done being crazy.
When it starts out great...

19:16.130 --> 19:18.776
all pilots and square cheese...
but ends up with you having to

19:18.776 --> 19:21.514
cut your friend out of
skintight leather pants.

19:21.514 --> 19:23.522
I will not miss those.

19:24.974 --> 19:26.092
So?

19:26.092 --> 19:27.626
Well, what you did
was reckless and wrong.

19:27.626 --> 19:31.845
But... it... it worked.

19:31.845 --> 19:33.273
So... thanks.

19:33.273 --> 19:37.871
Actually it felt good to be the guy
cleaning up the mess for a change.

19:38.519 --> 19:40.613
So are we okay?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.350
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

19:52.384 --> 19:53.929
The Veridian foundation...

19:54.313 --> 19:55.278
helping the world

19:56.269 --> 19:57.158
then telling people about it

19:57.158 --> 19:59.493
makes us feel so good.

19:59.493 --> 20:01.230
The Veridian foundation...

20:10.146 --> 20:11.115
Ow!

20:11.639 --> 20:12.838
I miss mugs.

20:12.838 --> 20:15.099
So Billy gave up lab equipment.

20:15.099 --> 20:16.898
He's moving to Fresno with the woman

20:16.898 --> 20:18.430
who cuts the cheese
at the airport lounge.

20:19.307 --> 20:20.648
We'll all be having fun with that.

20:21.352 --> 20:22.529
And Veronica got the Pentagon

20:22.529 --> 20:24.550
to finance a study on
how robots tolerate wind.

20:25.359 --> 20:27.607
$3 million later, it turns
out, they don't notice it.

20:28.902 --> 20:30.894
I appreciate you sticking
up for me with Mr. Page.

20:31.540 --> 20:32.476
You're tougher than thought, Linda.

20:32.476 --> 20:35.669
You're like a fire-breathing,
razor-back fawn.

20:35.669 --> 20:39.008
Oh, my God. This is a fawn.

20:41.784 --> 20:43.103
Oh.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.302
Then what was I thinking of?

20:45.993 --> 20:47.850
Oh, a monster. That was it.

20:47.850 --> 20:49.186
I always confuse those two.

20:49.186 --> 20:53.186
