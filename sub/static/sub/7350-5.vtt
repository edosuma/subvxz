WEBVTT

00:10.544 --> 00:12.480
GUIDE: So, uh, how long
y'all been married?

00:12.513 --> 00:13.647
MAN:
Just a week.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.083
We're on our
honeymoon.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.185
Camp Pendleton,
near San Diego, is home.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.353
Yeah, well I can't think of
a more romantic place than

00:19.387 --> 00:21.222
New Orleans or the Bayou.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.756
That said,

00:22.790 --> 00:25.126
hold on to your sweetheart,
'cause this is gator country.

00:25.159 --> 00:28.596
You never know what's
gonna come up for a nibble.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.198
Uh-oh...

00:30.231 --> 00:32.466
Uh-oh, look out.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.602
Here comes trouble.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.106
Oh, Lord have mercy.
That was close.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.176
Dude, it's fake.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.777
Oh yeah? Why don't you stick

00:43.811 --> 00:46.614
your hand in her mouth
and tell me how fake she is?

00:46.647 --> 00:49.850
That one looks way better.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.520
Can you, uh, pull closer?
We want to get a picture.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.456
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.358
No, no, we're not
getting closer.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.160
I'm calling
the police.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.095
That one's real.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.266
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:05.299 --> 01:08.102
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:08.136 --> 01:10.404
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:10.438 --> 01:11.705
* How, how, how, how

01:11.739 --> 01:14.275
* Hey, hey

01:19.913 --> 01:21.282
* You gotta come on.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.555
Mmm!

01:27.588 --> 01:31.725
Whoever invented praline bacon
should win a Nobel Prize.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.195
I can't even think of a
word to adequately describe

01:34.228 --> 01:37.165
how good this tastes.
Mmm!

01:37.198 --> 01:39.500
You should try some of these
shrimp and grits.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.169
So...

01:41.202 --> 01:43.404
I ran into a mutual friend
of ours last night--

01:43.437 --> 01:45.339
Logan Ross.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.608
Really

01:47.641 --> 01:49.343
In the French Quarter.
He was in town

01:49.377 --> 01:51.679
for the gospel festival.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.414
He said you two
worked together.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.283
Yeah, in Chicago.
Two years.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.285
Love me some Logan.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.353
He loves him some Brody.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.290
Good guy. Great storyteller.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.857
I mean, he told me a beauty.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.194
About...

02:06.227 --> 02:08.296
About you.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.333
Well, A: I don't have
anything to hide,

02:12.366 --> 02:14.735
and B:

02:14.768 --> 02:17.371
you should mind your
own damn business.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.673
Well, A: everyone
has something to hide.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.676
And B: he offered it up.
I didn't even have to ask.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.513
And C: since you don't
seem to like to divulge,

02:25.546 --> 02:27.248
I was all ears.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.717
Okay, did he tell
you about the time

02:29.750 --> 02:32.253
we went skinny dipping
in Lake Michigan?

02:32.286 --> 02:34.855
Because, remember,
in Europe,

02:34.888 --> 02:37.225
topless is just another
day at the beach.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.862
Pride.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.364
Dead Marine
in the bayou.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.399
Let's go.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.769
Now, like I said,
we-we was on the boat...

02:54.442 --> 02:55.309
WADE:
Brody, Lasalle.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.444
LASALLE:
Miss Loretta.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.312
What's up?

02:58.346 --> 03:00.781
Got a honeymooning couple
enjoying a bayou boat ride

03:00.814 --> 03:03.417
until they came
across the deceased.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.419
That's not what
I'm talking about, Loretta.

03:05.453 --> 03:06.620
Talking about that look
in your eye.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.222
I broke up with James.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.658
Why?

03:10.691 --> 03:14.528
He was... too interested
and available for my taste.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.597
Since when is available
is a problem?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.699
Well, he's never
been married, Dwayne.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.534
And any man his age

03:20.568 --> 03:23.337
who has never made
a serious commitment,

03:23.371 --> 03:25.839
they...
sends up red flags.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.509
Loretta, you're his age.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.411
You've never
been married either.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.881
This is why I like the dead.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.816
They don't call me
on my hypocrisy.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.385
Back to business.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.519
Chief Warrant Officer

03:38.552 --> 03:39.820
William Reed.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.358
Worked counterintelligence.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.395
His previous job was at Gitmo.

03:47.428 --> 03:52.032
I informed CACO to
notify his wife.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.667
Cause of death?

03:53.701 --> 03:55.803
It's still early
in the mystery, but

03:55.836 --> 03:57.338
chapter one is
that unfortunate

03:57.371 --> 04:00.308
contusion on his forehead.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.577
Looks perimortem.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.913
Happened close to
his time of death.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.381
Speaking of...

04:07.415 --> 04:09.317
estimate of TOD?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.951
I'd say between
6:00 and 9:00.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.420
Thank you.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.288
I'll know more later.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.789
Well, you always do.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.495
William was
the real deal.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.497
Dropped out of law school
the day after 9/11

04:23.531 --> 04:24.998
and enlisted in the Corps.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.368
Did two tours of duty
in Afghanistan.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.438
He was Human Source
Intelligence?
Yes, sir.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.441
His OQR said his last
posting was Guantanamo?

04:33.474 --> 04:36.610
OQR is Officer
Qualification Record.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.612
I'm from the Great Lakes
office, not Siberia.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.617
You said he was an interrogator?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.486
Dealt with the most
sensitive detainees.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.087
Guys they picked up
on the battlefield.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.622
Excuse me.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.461
Bag and tag computers,
tablets, phones--

04:53.494 --> 04:55.463
anything with a memory.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.864
We're gonna need
to identify his access

04:56.897 --> 04:58.466
to classified programs.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.468
You'll have to
read us in so we can

05:00.501 --> 05:01.702
review what he was working on.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.471
Yes, sir.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.573
I'm sorry.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.476
WADE:
The cause of death
is consistent with drowning.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.710
Which is not a surprise.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.379
So, my guess is you
either want to talk

05:11.412 --> 05:13.881
more about the end of your
relationship with James,

05:13.914 --> 05:16.450
or another shoe's
about to drop.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.819
The latter.
For sure.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.395
Bad timing?

05:27.428 --> 05:28.762
Hmm? Oh, not at all.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.465
I was just trying an experiment
in weight distribution.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.502
Someone once said to me,
"Always expect the unexpected."

05:34.535 --> 05:36.069
Unfortunately,
it was my urologist.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.071
And that is not the someone
you want to hear that from.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.141
Chemical
analysis showed the water

05:41.174 --> 05:43.511
found in Reed's lungs...
was not the same water

05:43.544 --> 05:44.745
he was discovered in.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.416
So he was drowned
somewhere else and was

05:48.449 --> 05:51.452
dumped in the wetlands?
Yeah, but that's
not the weird part.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.554
No, I'm thinking the weird
part was you sitting on him.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.989
You cannot underestimate
the importance of ergonomics.

05:56.023 --> 06:00.494
I found traces of black cotton
fibers in his nose and mouth.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.729
Yeah, and bruising
suggests something was

06:01.762 --> 06:03.731
pressed up
against his lips.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.634
If you'd be kind as to hold this
over LASMAN's mouth and nose.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.538
Uh, "Life-sized Articulated
Simulator Mannequin."

06:10.571 --> 06:13.674
With the dummies, it's best
when you keep it technical.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.911
A computer simulation
using available evidence

06:17.945 --> 06:20.748
indicates that his legs
were above his head;

06:20.781 --> 06:24.151
water went into the
victim's mouth and lungs,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.619
all consistent
with someone...

06:25.653 --> 06:27.455
Someone who was waterboarded.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.490
VANCE :
Waterboarded?

06:29.523 --> 06:33.026
Yes, Director. Gitmo forwarded
a list of all the prisoners

06:33.060 --> 06:35.095
Chief Warrant Officer
had contact with,

06:35.128 --> 06:38.131
along with
their current status.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.933
About half have been released.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.535
Any stand out?

06:41.569 --> 06:43.637
They all stand out.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.507
And all would see it
as a coup to...

06:46.540 --> 06:49.977
waterboard
a United States Marine.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.645
Any domestic chatter?

06:51.679 --> 06:53.481
The FBI says no.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.649
I've reached out to the CIA.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.950
But if this was retribution...

06:56.984 --> 06:59.487
Someone should be taking credit.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.455
Let me talk to NSA and Homeland,

07:01.489 --> 07:03.457
get everyone's point of view.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.626
Sir, if this gets any bigger

07:05.659 --> 07:08.128
I'm gonna need support
from Washington.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.030
Special Agent Pride,

07:10.063 --> 07:11.532
anything you need,

07:11.565 --> 07:13.534
that will be my priority.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.751
What do we know?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.252
LASALLE:
Interagency has nada--

07:32.285 --> 07:34.622
CIA, FBI, NSA--

07:34.655 --> 07:36.123
no one's reporting
chatter about

07:36.156 --> 07:38.058
Chief Warrant Officer
William Reed's death.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.260
Not a peep about
a plot to waterboard.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.263
Middle East, Far East, Africa--
No imminent threat.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.265
Silence?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.134
And then some.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.872
Just spoke to the
Casualty Assistance Officer.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.907
He's made his rounds...

07:53.941 --> 07:56.644
can't find
officer Reed's wife anywhere.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.011
Name is Marilyn Reed.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.179
Didn't show up for work.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.881
Cell goes straight
to voice mail.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.215
I'll get a home address.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.841
Keep knocking.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.943
I'll check around back.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.617
Okay... I know Logan
told you about

08:36.650 --> 08:38.652
my sister's
bachelorette party in Chicago.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.987
I'm sorry

08:40.020 --> 08:40.954
:
Ross.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.056
Oh, that Logan?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.592
The bachelorette party.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.026
That story? It's...

08:46.059 --> 08:47.561
It's really no big deal.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.029
'Cause I... honestly thought

08:49.062 --> 08:50.998
I had hired
a legitimate stripper.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.602
No. He didn't tell me
that story.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.970
But I appreciate the
added Brody intel.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.106
:
Hey.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.141
Someone jimmied
the side door.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.649
Eyes and ears. On my lead.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.651
NCIS!

09:10.684 --> 09:12.786
Federal agents!

09:27.701 --> 09:29.603
NCIS!
Oh, my God!
LASALLE: Who are you?

09:29.637 --> 09:31.972
Helaine. Helaine Morgan.
I-I live next door.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.041
Um...

09:34.074 --> 09:37.177
I, uh, I saw your... I saw
your car pull up and then I j...

09:37.210 --> 09:38.779
I came by to make sure
everything

09:38.812 --> 09:40.113
was all right with...

09:40.147 --> 09:42.650
You have a moment?
Yeah.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.352
Okay.
PRIDE: When was the last time
you saw William Reed

09:45.385 --> 09:46.787
or his wife?

09:46.820 --> 09:47.788
I saw Marilyn yesterday

09:47.821 --> 09:49.256
after her training session.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.158
Is she okay?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.761
You know he does
counterintelligence
for the Corps?

09:53.794 --> 09:55.262
Man is a patriot.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.065
And Marilyn is the wife
every patriot deserves.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.067
She takes care
of everything when he is

10:00.100 --> 10:02.369
out of town.
Did you notice anything unusual

10:02.402 --> 10:04.071
around the property last night?

10:04.104 --> 10:06.406
No. But I am the sort
of person who believes

10:06.439 --> 10:08.942
that what other folks do
is their business.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.011
Oh, hey!

10:12.079 --> 10:13.947
That's Jessica Flint.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.415
She's the biggest gossip
in Uptown.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.717
You would think that between

10:16.750 --> 10:18.318
her husband having an affair

10:18.351 --> 10:21.154
and her gambling issues,
Jessica would be more discreet.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.256
No. I work at Harrah's--
I deal blackjack--

10:23.290 --> 10:25.959
I see that woman
there all the time.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.095
So much for minding
your own business.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.163
We're gonna
get our kits.

10:30.197 --> 10:33.901
But where the house
is concerned...
Mm-hmm.

10:33.934 --> 10:37.404
you saw nothing unusual
in the last 24 hours?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.007
Could a car
be considered unusual?

10:40.040 --> 10:43.811
Dark color, maybe black,
maybe blue.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.813
It had some kind of medallion
on the hood.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.448
I don't know much about cars,
other than Marty DuChance

10:48.481 --> 10:51.084
on Maringy has one that feels
like a midlife crisis.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.086
Ma'am...
Mm-hmm.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.789
here is my card.
Okay.

10:57.958 --> 11:02.029
Call me
if you remember anything else.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.732
You wouldn't happen
to be single, would you?

11:04.765 --> 11:08.001
LASALLE: Pride, I need you
to come take a look at this.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.202
Yeah.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.804
You know where I live.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.780
Looks like blood.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.215
Not likely barbecue sauce.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.789
What is that?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.725
A rag?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.394
It's a piece
of glove.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.897
Piece of a black glove.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.901
I know that look.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.903
What if Reed drowned here?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.505
He's a Marine.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.241
My guess is the killer...

11:48.275 --> 11:52.312
was able to...
surprise him somehow.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.151
Driveway.

11:59.887 --> 12:03.857
Bad guy standing here,
Reed comes home.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.259
Through the gate.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.096
Surprises him.
A struggle occurs.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.163
And then he gets driven

12:10.197 --> 12:11.865
right into the fountain.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.266
Hits his head.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.202
He's half in,
half out of the water.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.870
Feet above his head.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.439
Bad guy's wearing black gloves.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.208
Hand over Reed's mouth,

12:21.241 --> 12:23.443
leaves fibers as trace evidence.

12:23.476 --> 12:27.114
We have waterboarding without
actually being waterboarded.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.917
BRODY: About Reed's wife,
found a bunch of pictures

12:29.950 --> 12:33.253
of Marilyn with Mr. Fancy Pants.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.156
Is that...

12:36.189 --> 12:37.991
PRIDE:
Oliver Huntington.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.993
Who's he?
Well, you kind of nailed it

12:40.027 --> 12:42.229
with "Mr. Fancy Pants."
Huntingtons are one

12:42.262 --> 12:44.231
of the most influential families
in New Orleans.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.532
What's his relationship
to Marilyn?

12:45.565 --> 12:48.802
Hmm.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.203
Kin.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.806
That's his
little sister.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.876
All right,
get some blood samples--

12:55.909 --> 12:58.045
and Christopher, I want you
to canvass the neighborhood,

12:58.078 --> 12:59.512
see if there are
any surveillance cameras

12:59.546 --> 13:01.281
that might've caught
a blue or black sedan

13:01.314 --> 13:02.816
with a medallion
on the hood.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.517
Brody, get your
Sunday shoes on.

13:04.551 --> 13:08.922
You're about to get introduced
to New Orleans aristocracy.

13:10.958 --> 13:14.261
BRODY: We're concerned
about your sister.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.397
Marilyn

13:17.430 --> 13:19.532
Have you talked to her recently?

13:19.566 --> 13:22.002
Uh, it's been...

13:22.035 --> 13:23.203
at least a week.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.006
She's at a yoga
retreat in Santa Fe.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.507
It's up in
the mountains.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.176
Bad reception. It's impossible
to get ahold of her,

13:29.209 --> 13:30.844
which is probably the point.

13:30.878 --> 13:34.347
Can we get the name
of where she's staying, Oliver?

13:34.381 --> 13:37.484
Sure. She sent it to me in a...
in an e-mail. Please.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.352
Come on in.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.189
After her last birthday,
Marilyn decided to...

13:42.222 --> 13:45.092
"get healthy."
She's always been... sickly.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.894
She, uh...

13:46.927 --> 13:50.363
she got our father's
genetic flaws

13:50.397 --> 13:52.299
and our mother's
crazy allergies.

13:52.332 --> 13:56.203
She changed
her whole diet and, uh,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.438
started seeing
this personal trainer.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.241
Is it possible that...

14:01.274 --> 14:04.644
William's death h-had
something to do with his work?

14:04.677 --> 14:08.481
We haven't determined that yet.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.484
That's... that's awful.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.320
That's just...

14:14.354 --> 14:16.556
Marilyn...

14:16.589 --> 14:19.192
gave up everything for William.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.029
My parents weren't exactly
thrilled with the idea of...

14:22.062 --> 14:24.464
Marilyn marrying a military man.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.200
In my family,

14:27.234 --> 14:29.536
you married for power or status.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.404
So what happened?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.473
Love won.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.978
I'm sorry,
I-I can't find this e-mail.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.279
We'd appreciate
if you'd keep looking.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.949
And let us know
as soon as you hear from her.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.316
Of course.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.387
You never played
mailbox baseball?

14:47.420 --> 14:48.989
I grew up in the city.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.224
The only mailbox was
in the lobby of our building.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.592
That would've been awkward.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.295
That said, I did flourish
at the art of stickball.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.198
The math is fascinating.
A spherical orb hurls

14:58.231 --> 15:00.400
towards you at
75 miles per hour.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.635
You have 0.8 seconds to decide
on a course of action

15:02.669 --> 15:05.338
and even less time to execute
said course of action.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.108
In the end, they called me
"the Sultan of Du-bat."

15:09.676 --> 15:13.180
"Du-Bat, Dubai"--
it's a "du-pun."

15:13.213 --> 15:15.148
It's a dud, that's what it is.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.349
PRIDE:
Tell me things.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.617
LASALLE:
Good news.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.219
We got something.
For once,

15:19.252 --> 15:20.453
the video
is crystal clear.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.522
Which never happens, ever.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.224
Usually, it's, "Oh, hey,
look, there's Bigfoot.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.459
Quick, grab the worst camera
money can buy."

15:26.493 --> 15:28.361
Got surveillance
from three different houses

15:28.395 --> 15:30.730
in Reed's neighborhood...
neighbor down the street

15:30.763 --> 15:32.499
pointed a security camera
to the mailbox.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.567
And looky here,
the car

15:34.601 --> 15:37.504
Helaine was talking about.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.506
Oliver Huntington.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.408
Why didn't he tell us
he was at the house?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.543
Come on.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.290
We need to chat.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.425
Okay.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.094
I'll, uh... I'll re-park.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.232
He's not going to...

16:05.265 --> 16:08.635
Park. No, he's not.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.770
PRIDE: He's going back in
the driveway; I'm gonna follow.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.040
You go around the corner
and cut him off, Chris.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.374
LASALLE:
I'm on it, King.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.447
(engines revving,
tires screeching)

16:21.648 --> 16:24.184
LASALLE:
I got him.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.560
I'll stick with him.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.661
PRIDE:
I'll head up Camp.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.563
He's turning off

16:36.596 --> 16:38.531
Magazine onto 4th.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.135
PRIDE: I got him!

16:49.442 --> 16:51.578
Hands on the steering wheel!

16:51.611 --> 16:54.114
Please, please,
you can't be here.
Get out of the car.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.482
Get out of the car.
I can't be seen with you!
Please!

16:55.515 --> 16:56.649
Where's your sister, Oliver?
Where's Marilyn?

16:56.683 --> 17:00.220
I don't know.
I swear.
Then why were you running, huh?

17:00.253 --> 17:02.455
And why didn't you mention
you went to her home yesterday?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.558
Please go away.
They're watching.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.460
Who?
Who's watching?

17:08.761 --> 17:10.563
Marilyn's been kidnapped.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.133
They said they'd hurt her
if I talked to the police.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.401
That's why I lied.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.138
I have 24 hours to
pay them $3 million,

17:18.171 --> 17:20.340
or they're gonna kill her.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.852
Oliver, I'm...

17:32.885 --> 17:35.788
I'm in trouble.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.424
They've killed William.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.093
Oliver, please, just...

17:40.127 --> 17:42.562
pay them and they say
they'll let me go.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.099
I know that things have not been
the best between us,

17:46.133 --> 17:49.169
but, Oliver, please, just give
them whatever they want

17:49.202 --> 17:50.637
so they don't kill me.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.573
That's a first for me.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.343
So her brother Oliver
got a text message

17:56.376 --> 17:58.178
with a video
attached?

17:58.211 --> 18:00.680
You can do pretty much anything
on the Internet these days.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.883
We'll trace the text, but my
guess is it's from a burn phone.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.519
All right.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.521
We got 22 hours.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.390
Broaden the search.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.626
Reach out to local PDs,
sheriff departments--

18:13.660 --> 18:16.529
their jurisdiction,
but we got a dog in this fight.

18:16.563 --> 18:20.167
And we need to clone
Oliver's phone before he leaves,

18:20.200 --> 18:21.868
so any new texts or calls

18:21.901 --> 18:24.904
from the kidnapper come in to us
at the same time.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.140
Look at this.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.709
See that mark on her cheek?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.578
Is that a bruise?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.281
She may have been hit.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.217
All right, ask Sebastian to go
over the video pixel by pixel.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.852
Look for... anything
that might give us a clue

18:39.886 --> 18:41.888
where she's at. Audio, too.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.623
Might hear something.
Now that we know
the murder

18:43.656 --> 18:45.458
is part of a kidnapping,
maybe we should circle back

18:45.492 --> 18:46.859
around Reed's neighborhood,
see if we can get

18:46.893 --> 18:48.728
who was coming and
going, who had access.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.797
Go. Now. Learn things.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.833
Press is gonna eat this up.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.203
High profile,
high society victim.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.374
Get ahold of
Fornell in DC.

19:01.408 --> 19:05.312
Tell him if he'll allow us
to borrow his FBI expertise,

19:05.345 --> 19:09.916
I got a muffuletta with his
name on it waiting for him.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.854
I have to pay them, right?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.490
I mean, they're dangerous.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.192
They killed my brother-in-law.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.860
We're bringing
in the FBI.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.763
They'll help us decide
the best course of action.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.199
But once you hand
over the money,

19:26.233 --> 19:28.768
you've given away the only
leverage that you have.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.307
I need to see her again.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.711
I'm gonna pay the ransom.
I j...

19:38.745 --> 19:40.413
I just...

19:40.447 --> 19:42.382
I'll pay them

19:42.415 --> 19:43.750
and they'll let Marilyn go.
All right, just...

19:43.783 --> 19:44.984
hold on, hold on.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.853
Who's handling the money
for you?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.922
Bernard Lanier,

19:49.956 --> 19:52.959
the attorney who administers
my family trust. Why?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.827
Be all right if I talked to him?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.463
If you think that would help.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.534
LANIER:
I hope this doesn't sound,

20:01.568 --> 20:04.937
um, inappropriate, but...

20:04.971 --> 20:07.807
are you sure this kidnapping
is legitimate?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.442
The Huntington trust
was set up

20:09.476 --> 20:11.944
so Oliver would only get
payments every five years,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.680
rather than all the money
at once.

20:13.713 --> 20:17.450
And, uh, over the years,
Oliver's come to me with many...

20:17.484 --> 20:19.819
mmm, interesting stories,

20:19.852 --> 20:22.622
trying to get early access
to the funds.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.292
We've got William Reed's body
in the morgue, Mr. Lanier.

20:25.325 --> 20:29.329
I can assure you he's not
a figment of our imagination.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.532
Marilyn's husband

20:32.565 --> 20:34.967
is dead?

20:35.001 --> 20:37.970
I'm sorry. I-I didn't know.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.310
LASALLE:
We appreciate you talking
to us again.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.944
We're looking
for any info you have

20:44.977 --> 20:47.414
on who might have had access
to the house.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.015
You see anybody
you don't trust?

20:49.048 --> 20:52.285
Well, the gardener comes weekly,
pest control is monthly.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.987
And they like bottled water,
so that gets delivered

20:55.021 --> 20:56.823
the third Tuesday of the month.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.825
Oh!

20:58.858 --> 21:01.428
There is a new trainer.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.430
Rance, which I don't think
is a name.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.931
It's more like a salad dressing.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.333
If anything happened,

21:06.366 --> 21:08.568
he'd be the first person
I'd call.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.604
Why is that?
He just acts peculiar
around Marilyn.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.072
You know, stalker potential.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.342
How often is Rance in?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.577
Twice a week, 4:00 p.m.,
sometimes on the weekends,

21:17.610 --> 21:21.381
and sometimes... after hours.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.352
Sebastian?

21:25.385 --> 21:27.987
Yeah, right here.
Anything on the body?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.790
Hmm. I was hoping
I'd find something on the victim

21:30.823 --> 21:33.926
that could benefit Pride
in identifying the kidnappers.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.329
Unfortunately,
I'm coming up empty-handed .

21:36.363 --> 21:38.498
I'm not. Check this out.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.667
I'm using a new ultra-high
resolution scanner

21:40.700 --> 21:43.002
to go through this footage
with a fine-tooth comb.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.338
Do you know what that is?

21:45.372 --> 21:48.107
Peeling paint.
Oh.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.776
A layer of yellow
under light blue,

21:49.809 --> 21:52.445
primed by an old base coat
of leaded eggshell.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.381
Oh, and that bruise
on her face--

21:54.414 --> 21:55.615
it's actually a hive.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.519
Apparently, she's got a
laundry list of allergies.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.688
I've requested a copy
of her medical records.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.556
Her hive, or urticaria,
appears to be

22:03.590 --> 22:06.025
in the early stages due
to the absence of plaques.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.695
See what happens is, when,
uh, blood plasma leaks out

22:08.728 --> 22:10.397
of the small blood vessels,
in response

22:10.430 --> 22:12.098
to histamine,
what happens is...

22:12.131 --> 22:14.934
Thank you, Sebastian, but I'm
tight with all the histamines.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.604
Tell me,

22:17.637 --> 22:21.541
could I use this machine
on Chief Warrant Officer Reed?

22:21.574 --> 22:23.743
Pan and scan the dead?

22:25.077 --> 22:27.414
It's creepy, but cool.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.649
Bring that gizmo
into the other room.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.084
Awesome. His follicles
will be colossal.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.921
It'll be like human
cave spelunking.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.429
Dinner at August and Cochon.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.631
Don't forget chicken
from Willie Mae's.

22:44.664 --> 22:48.501
Let it be known that you are
not a complicated man, Tobias.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.470
I always think better
when my stomach's full.

22:50.503 --> 22:53.440
Thank you for coming.
Where are we on the clock?

22:53.473 --> 22:55.408
A little over seven
and a half hours to go.

22:55.442 --> 23:00.112
Senior FBI Agent Tobias Fornell,
Special Agent Meredith Brody.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.881
Of course you
know Lasalle.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.416
Christopher.
Agent Fornell.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.984
Nice to finally
meet you in person.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.453
I've heard good
things about you.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.187
Yeah, we've all heard
good things about her.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.789
You need to
stop right now.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.491
Any update on
the personal trainer?

23:11.524 --> 23:13.092
LASALLE:
Yeah, we tracked down

23:13.125 --> 23:14.494
his cell phone record.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.429
He calls Marilyn
three times a day.

23:16.463 --> 23:18.798
Taking into account
that he is a trainer,

23:18.831 --> 23:20.767
slash nutritionist,
slash life coach,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.470
that's a lot.
And look at this.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.438
PRIDE:
Rance declared

23:25.472 --> 23:27.574
bankruptcy a month ago.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.609
Money must be tight.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.678
Who hires a personal trainer
in New Orleans?

23:31.711 --> 23:33.212
All you people do
around here is sweat.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.181
Sounds like he's
got a motive.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.416
Sounds like a reason
to pick him up.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.921
Look, I don't have
to tell you guys anything.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.457
It's called
"trainer-client privilege."

23:44.491 --> 23:47.026
Really? I never
heard of that.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.463
Sorry. I-I didn't have time
for lunch today.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.770
What's with the cupcake?

23:57.804 --> 23:59.639
Brody found
a couple of videos

23:59.672 --> 24:02.074
on Rance's YouTube channel.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.744
Apparently, he used
to have a weight problem,

24:04.777 --> 24:08.014
and cupcakes were
his kryptonite.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.516
Ooh.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.984
Psychological torture. Fun.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.256
Look, I've told you
all the places I've been.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.493
I have a schedule.
It's the same thing every day.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.031
So...

24:25.064 --> 24:28.000
your business hit a bit
of a rough patch, right?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.604
Which is why
you're declaring bankruptcy?

24:31.638 --> 24:34.607
I overextended, that's all.

24:34.641 --> 24:38.144
So, you've taken
on a very specific clientele.

24:38.177 --> 24:42.515
You become their confidant,
they trust you.

24:42.549 --> 24:46.285
You have sex with them,
break up their marriages,

24:46.318 --> 24:48.154
and then ask for their money.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.157
My job is to make them feel
better about themselves.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.960
Marilyn wasn't interested.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.696
Marilyn loved her husband.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.297
And that made you mad.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.101
And you're so desperate,
right now, for money.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.536
You are dead wrong!

25:03.570 --> 25:05.605
Marilyn's husband
is the one who's dead.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.039
Sit!

25:10.910 --> 25:12.545
RANCE:
Lady,

25:12.579 --> 25:14.781
I swear to you,

25:14.814 --> 25:16.816
I can't help you.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.853
I wish to God I could.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.990
It's not him.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.692
Agreed.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.561
Linguistic analysis
of the ransom text indicates

25:28.595 --> 25:32.264
that the kidnapper was likely
a well-educated man

25:32.298 --> 25:34.233
raised in the South, meticulous,

25:34.266 --> 25:36.836
patient...
Which is not Rance.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.672
Text also contains
sociolinguistic clues,

25:39.706 --> 25:43.342
which indicate
that the writer is Caucasian,

25:43.375 --> 25:45.344
has more
than a six-figure income.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.313
All this from 36 words?

25:47.346 --> 25:50.617
Well, 99% of American English
is pretty much used the same.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.284
It's the remaining one percent

25:52.318 --> 25:55.221
that contains the variables used
in linguistic profiling.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.590
LASALLE:
Geolocators on Rance's cell

25:57.624 --> 25:58.791
validate his story.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.627
He wasn't
anywhere near her house.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.828
NOPD's running down

26:01.861 --> 26:03.295
pest control
and the gardener.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.897
Ransom text was
from a burner phone.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.298
It was only turned
on long enough

26:06.332 --> 26:07.634
to ping one tower near Canal.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.936
Kidnapper's not making mistakes.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.672
And time is running out.

26:17.710 --> 26:20.279
Loretta.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.283
Need some good news, Loretta.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.318
Using Sebastian's scanner,

26:26.352 --> 26:29.021
I took extra care
in studying Reed's dermis.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.758
Around the cuticles,
I found something growing.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.093
That sounds unappealing.

26:36.663 --> 26:37.964
Aquatic fungi.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.199
It's from sweet
bay magnolias.

26:40.232 --> 26:43.302
Unusual to the region,

26:43.335 --> 26:45.204
not evident
where the body was found,

26:45.237 --> 26:47.306
but, according to a dear friend
who's a botanist

26:47.339 --> 26:50.209
at the National Park Service,
not impossible.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.813
I took the fungi
information,

26:53.846 --> 26:55.648
together with the
satellite imagery.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.249
Was able to create a map

26:57.283 --> 26:59.385
narrowing Chief
Warrant Officer's

26:59.418 --> 27:03.089
entry site into the river
to an area of about

27:03.122 --> 27:05.324
a thousand yards.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.259
E-mailed it to you and cc'd

27:07.293 --> 27:09.061
Lasalle and Brody.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.430
Loretta, you
are the best.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.833
Ooh, and so it is written.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.103
BRODY:
It's fall.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.971
Why is it so hot?

27:19.005 --> 27:22.174
Is the weather making you
homesick for the Great Lakes?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.443
In the Midwest,
we have winters.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.112
Ever get a taste of one?

27:26.145 --> 27:28.781
In New Orleans Vice, I learned
to shovel with the best of' em.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.149
I ain't shoveling snow, too.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.420
Mexico.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.856
Logan told you about our
vacation to Cancun, didn't he?

27:36.889 --> 27:39.792
Look, if I hadn't have eaten the
tequila worm, I would have...

27:39.826 --> 27:42.995
LASALLE:
Heads up.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.464
If Doc Wade's right,
and Reed was nearby,

27:45.497 --> 27:48.067
it's possible the folks
in that house saw something.

27:49.736 --> 27:50.937
All right, let's go.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.911
MAN: Guess you missed the
"no trespassing" signs.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.380
Hands up! Turn around!

28:13.159 --> 28:14.794
We're federal agents.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.062
I'm gonna reach
into my front pocket

28:16.095 --> 28:17.897
and pull out an I.D.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.767
So you can do what, show me some
phony badge you bought on eBay?

28:20.800 --> 28:23.169
The badges are real.
So are the guns we're carrying.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.805
Don't get all bowed up.
MAN:
Bowed up?

28:25.838 --> 28:27.940
Where are you from?
'Bama.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.909
That explains why you walked
past my signs.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.343
Couldn't read 'em.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.012
LASALLE:
All right, how about this?

28:33.045 --> 28:36.148
You reach into my front pocket
and pull out my I.D.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.885
That way you know I'm not
pulling any tricks on you.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.464
How do you feel
about Alabama now?

29:00.139 --> 29:02.508
"Albert Fontenot."

29:02.541 --> 29:05.244
I know my rights!
You don't have a warrant!

29:05.277 --> 29:07.814
Sorry, "koonyon," the whole
rights thing went out the window

29:07.847 --> 29:08.915
once you pulled a gun.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.551
House is remote.
Good hiding place.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.521
I've got nothing to hide.

29:18.825 --> 29:20.326
Man's got hooch breath.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.829
Where is it, brother?

29:22.862 --> 29:24.296
Where is what?

29:29.869 --> 29:33.840
No wonder
you don't like visitors.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.474
You can take a case,
if you'd like.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.476
It's a smooth,
clear IPA

29:37.509 --> 29:40.179
with faint citrus, honey flavor
notes and a dry finish.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.516
Don't dress it up.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.419
It's still moonshine.
It's my passion.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.255
You pay taxes on your passion?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.857
Ask my accountant.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.592
How long you lived
in this house?

29:53.625 --> 29:56.028
I rented the place
six months ago.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.496
What the hell is going on here?

29:57.529 --> 29:59.465
No sign of Marilyn here.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.333
House is clean.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.836
I did find something
by the river, though.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.338
Don't you go anywhere.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.307
Oh, yeah, sure.
D-Don't mind me.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.910
I'm totally comfortable here.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.449
LASALLE:
Heel marks are dug in.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.153
Someone was dragged
into the water.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.891
Look.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.326
Color is consistent
with Reed's uniform.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.297
I think we found
our point of entry.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.133
Well, if we did,
we didn't just stumble upon it.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.635
You don't just dump a body here
by chance.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.305
Whoever did this knows the area.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.240
I wonder who owns the property.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.975
Let's find out.

30:44.911 --> 30:48.915
Here's the information
on that property.

30:48.948 --> 30:52.919
Oliver financed it through
the trust, purchased a year ago,

30:52.952 --> 30:55.321
recently rented
to the moonshiner.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.624
Do you have any news
about my sister?

30:58.657 --> 31:01.427
Not yet, but we have
some evidence

31:01.460 --> 31:03.595
that might help.
We need you to come down

31:03.629 --> 31:07.266
and take a look at it.
Okay.

31:07.299 --> 31:10.536
OLIVER: I don't care
what the deed says! I-I-I...

31:10.569 --> 31:11.971
I don't know a thing about it!

31:12.004 --> 31:13.439
Your name is right here.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.974
For God's sake's,
why are you interrogating me?

31:15.007 --> 31:16.909
You should be out
looking for my sister.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.945
BRODY: How's your cash flow
these days, Mr. Huntington?

31:18.978 --> 31:20.679
FORNELL: You went to
your attorney and asked him

31:20.712 --> 31:23.282
to accelerate your next
trust payment.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.252
He said no. Maybe you
went looking for another way.

31:26.285 --> 31:29.021
You're suggesting since
I'm not good at budgeting...

31:29.055 --> 31:32.024
I-I killed my brother-in-law
and I kidnapped my sister.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.964
New deadline.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.967
60 minutes left.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.002
We're wasting time. Please.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.637
Be a neat trick to text himself
when he was with us.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.407
And he didn't know
he was gonna be with us.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.644
BRODY:
Hold on. We'll be back.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.413
Who brokered

31:54.446 --> 31:57.984
Oliver's purchase
of the house and property?

31:58.017 --> 31:59.986
Well-educated man, grew up

32:00.019 --> 32:02.621
in the South, meticulous,
patient, six-figure income.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.256
Bet it was...
Bernard Lanier.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.657
BRODY:
So this is the land contract

32:05.691 --> 32:09.428
for the property rented
by Mr. Mensa Moonshiner.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.030
The property
Oliver claims not

32:11.063 --> 32:12.664
to know anything about?

32:12.698 --> 32:15.401
Signature on the top
is supposed to be Oliver's,

32:15.434 --> 32:17.269
on the bottom,
the lawyer's.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.737
So what am I
looking for here,

32:18.770 --> 32:20.739
besides some
char

32:20.772 --> 32:24.276
Look at the "n"
in Bernard and the "n"

32:24.310 --> 32:26.112
in Huntington.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.280
They are identical.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.415
You're damn right
they are.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.583
Stay in your office,
please, sir.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.960
NCIS, Mr. Lanier.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.503
NCIS! Open up!

32:53.205 --> 32:54.440
(people screaming,
murmuring in distance)

33:10.422 --> 33:12.491
Lanier always had
access to the accounts,

33:12.524 --> 33:14.260
but with the
kidnapping,

33:14.293 --> 33:15.594
he could empty them

33:15.627 --> 33:17.129
and it wouldn't be suspicious.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.169
Huntington's money is gone
as of 30 seconds ago.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.704
And now, the only one who can
lead us to Marilyn...

33:25.737 --> 33:27.739
is dead.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.685
Let us know if you
find anything, Sheriff.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.487
(Sheriff speaks indistinctly
over phone)

33:44.556 --> 33:47.393
Come on, now,
we got a woman tied up,

33:47.426 --> 33:48.394
God knows where.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.396
No idea if she's got food

33:50.429 --> 33:52.164
or water or even air--
where we at?

33:52.198 --> 33:55.201
NOPD came up empty at both
Lanier's house and office.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.269
Whatever he knew, he took
to the grave with him.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.705
Lanier's cell phone
activity coming in hot.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.640
BRODY:
Link just showed up.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.109
Nothing worth
mentioning.

34:05.311 --> 34:06.545
How about the GPS on his car?

34:06.578 --> 34:08.214
Same as his phone--

34:08.247 --> 34:10.516
nothing.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.385
Pull up the list of all the
properties that Lanier bought

34:13.419 --> 34:15.854
for Huntington
and make me a map.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.124
I got Lanier and Huntington's
properties

34:18.157 --> 34:19.525
showing up on satellite imagery.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.393
Brody, help analyze these.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.762
We tracked the money--
all over the globe.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.365
It's still bouncing around.
I figured.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.367
He knew we would
try and track the ransom.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.602
Made it impossible
for us to follow.

34:30.636 --> 34:31.603
Worth a shot.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.674
Sebastian.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.512
Talk to me, Sebastian.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.548
I don't know if this helps,
but the audio analysis

34:42.581 --> 34:44.883
on the ransom video
picked up sprinklers.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.285
That's it?

34:46.318 --> 34:47.586
Well, they're a particular

34:47.619 --> 34:49.288
sprinkler, more like

34:49.321 --> 34:51.257
a mister that's used
at plant nurseries.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.558
Or a greenhouse.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.526
Thanks, Sebastian.
One of his properties

34:54.560 --> 34:56.562
has several greenhouses.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.431
One of Marilyn's allergies
was flowers, right?

34:59.465 --> 35:00.766
And dander from three
different flowers--

35:00.799 --> 35:02.734
daisies, orchids and sunflowers.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.703
Lanier had orchids
in his office.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.572
Get the address
for that greenhouse.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.573
You sure that's it?

35:07.606 --> 35:09.575
No time for sure anymore.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.239
She's gotta be
here somewhere.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.444
Hundred-meter perimeter search.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.379
All of it. Go.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.582
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

36:33.825 --> 36:37.763
Uh, I got you
some, uh...

36:37.796 --> 36:39.731
Thank you.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.200
Yeah.

36:43.602 --> 36:46.004
He was, um...

36:46.037 --> 36:48.340
he was so brave, Oliver.

36:48.374 --> 36:51.277
William, he, um...

36:51.310 --> 36:53.679
he fought really hard.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.920
How is it that he could
survive two tours at war

37:01.953 --> 37:04.590
only to die over...

37:04.623 --> 37:06.625
what, money?

37:13.499 --> 37:15.501
I'm sorry.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.342
Come here.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.819
FORNELL:
Okay to start talking
about eating again?

37:33.852 --> 37:36.722
I believe so.
Where do you want to start?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.424
Well, we start
at the top

37:38.457 --> 37:40.426
of my demand list,
then we work

37:40.459 --> 37:42.528
our way down.
You're gonna cost me
a fortune, aren't you?

37:42.561 --> 37:44.663
Too bad Lanier didn't
transfer you all that money.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.770
What is it, Dwayne?

37:51.803 --> 37:54.005
If you're gonna
kill yourself...

37:54.039 --> 37:56.575
why bother
transferring the money?

38:14.793 --> 38:16.862
Need a hand with
your luggage?

38:18.730 --> 38:21.567
Special Agent Pride.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.369
Are you here
for the fishing?

38:25.971 --> 38:27.973
No, I am not.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.779
Nobody was supposed to be hurt.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.450
But William
came home early?

38:38.484 --> 38:40.519
It wasn't my idea.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.087
It was Bernard's.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.955
He had the gambling problem.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.692
And you worked
in the casino.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.863
You have to
understand, Bernard--

38:51.897 --> 38:53.699
he fell for me hard.

38:53.732 --> 38:57.369
He suggested
the kidnapping, he did all

38:57.403 --> 38:58.770
of the planning--
if anything,

38:58.804 --> 39:00.872
I'm also a victim.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.875
A victim with
a couple million dollars.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.811
Waiting.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.379
Where?

39:07.413 --> 39:09.415
Costa Rica

39:12.183 --> 39:15.887
I'm guessing that bandage
is from travel vaccines.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.762
You know...

39:23.795 --> 39:25.797
I don't need all the money.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.636
Maybe just half.

39:33.439 --> 39:36.041
You don't need any of it
where you're going.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.895
All right...

39:56.928 --> 39:58.530
Lasalle, I'm done
with this game.

39:58.564 --> 39:59.865
You're gonna tell me the story

39:59.898 --> 40:01.166
and you're gonna tell me now.

40:01.199 --> 40:04.169
Okay.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.804
Logan didn't tell me anything.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.773
I made it all up.

40:08.607 --> 40:11.142
For an interrogator,
you got got.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.111
Aw, come on.
I feel bad,

40:13.144 --> 40:16.448
having all this
fresh intel.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.083
I should offer you something.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.818
Really

40:19.851 --> 40:22.187
Okay, so...

40:22.220 --> 40:23.955
I dated this girl in college

40:23.989 --> 40:26.692
and she had a weird thing
for men who wore skirts.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.594
Really?
Yeah.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.896
I-I put on this miniskirt...
Okay!

40:30.929 --> 40:33.231
Okay, you can just
stop right here.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.133
Well, I want to make this right.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.969
I... I'm sure you do.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.138
And I just want to remind you

40:40.171 --> 40:42.608
that one of the tools
of a great interrogator

40:42.641 --> 40:44.943
is to make your subject feel

40:44.976 --> 40:46.678
like he's in control,

40:46.712 --> 40:49.047
when really, you are.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.882
Guess who I had breakfast with

40:50.916 --> 40:54.686
right before you told me you
knew this great secret about me?

40:54.720 --> 40:56.254
Logan?

40:56.287 --> 40:58.957
And guess who told me

40:58.990 --> 41:00.592
he ran into you the night before

41:00.626 --> 41:02.861
and didn't say squat?

41:02.894 --> 41:04.062
Logan again?

41:04.095 --> 41:06.264
And guess whose stories
all that intel

41:06.297 --> 41:08.667
you thought you got
over the past few days

41:08.700 --> 41:10.869
was what falls out
of the backside of a bull.

41:10.902 --> 41:14.940
Ex-vice guy, you got got.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.842
This ain't over.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.043
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.645
Hah!
