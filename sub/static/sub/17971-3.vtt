ready to play."

00:37.104 --> 00:38.337

00:54.654 --> 00:57.489
Rallo, you boys been playing
with my shoes again?

00:57.491 --> 00:58.457
No.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.691
Really?

01:01.594 --> 01:03.328
You know what
this means.

01:03.330 --> 01:07.466

Hey, girl!

Wow, Donna,

01:54.482 --> 01:57.483
this house is a veritable
beehive of activity.

02:14.802 --> 02:15.968
What are you doing, son?

02:15.970 --> 02:17.536
Counting to a million.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.838
Why... why are you
doing that?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.473
Why does anybody do anything?

02:21.475 --> 02:24.443
Did you eat the brownies
in the back of the freezer?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.344
No.

02:25.346 --> 02:25.878
Good. Don't!

02:25.880 --> 02:29.781
'Cause they're your dad's

Okay.

02:33.687 --> 02:37.456
Man, I got to find
Cleveland Jr. a friend.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.323
I agree.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.358
That boy is lonelier than

02:39.360 --> 02:42.661
a widowed trapeze artist
with Alzheimer's.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.962

02:43.964 --> 02:44.897
Ah.

02:44.899 --> 02:46.732
(drumroll)

02:46.734 --> 02:47.733
Ah.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.368
(drumroll)

02:49.370 --> 02:50.636
Ah.

02:51.771 --> 02:54.273
This is a good place
to meet people.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.841
See anyone
who interests you?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.676
That guy seems cool.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.381
Or how about
that young man over there

03:02.383 --> 03:03.749
playing basketball?

03:03.751 --> 03:06.418
Hey, mind
if we play?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.352
Sure.
All right.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.821
The two of you against
this old-timer.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.822
Check it.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.591
Ow! Ow!

03:12.593 --> 03:13.825
Foul! Foul!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.460
Daddy, he's leaving.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.029
Well, then
he forfeits.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.797
You forfeit!

03:22.602 --> 03:23.835
He seems lonely.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.638
Looks like he could
use a friend, too.

03:26.773 --> 03:30.642
Hey, sport,
I got a proposition for you.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.443
Yeah?

03:31.445 --> 03:32.311
My name's Cleveland.

03:32.313 --> 03:35.414
How'd you like to play
with Cleveland Jr.?

03:35.416 --> 03:36.548
What?
Oh, you'll love him.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.319
He's a little chubby, but
he's always up for a good time.

03:40.321 --> 03:43.689
A lot of other kids have jerked
him around, but I can tell

03:43.691 --> 03:46.091
you're the kind of guy
who would treat him right.

03:46.093 --> 03:50.762
Don't get me wrong: he's
a handful, but a nice handful.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.764
Look, I'll be
honest with you.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.733
I'm tired of
playing with him.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.801
You want to see him?

03:55.803 --> 03:59.037
Come over by the car,
and I'll let you have a look.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.739
Come on, what do you say?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.407
I'll give you
30 bucks right now

04:02.409 --> 04:04.643
if you play with him
in the car.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.777
Boomerang.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.745
(sirens whoop)

04:06.747 --> 04:07.846
(cocking guns)

04:07.848 --> 04:10.515
You know, once I read
over the transcript,

04:10.517 --> 04:14.086
I could see how my words
might have been misconstrued.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.787
Thanks for trying
to help me, Dad.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.857
Maybe we'll find me
a friend tomorrow.

04:18.859 --> 04:19.825
Yes, we will.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.628
And if not then,
then the next day.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.831
And if not then, then
the next day.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.033
And if not then,
we'll give up.

04:28.035 --> 04:32.070
Because that will have been
four days, and that's enough.

04:32.072 --> 04:35.474
Hey, there's Lester
Krinklesac's boy.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.643
What are you doing, Ernie?

04:37.645 --> 04:38.510
Playing kick
the can.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.178
I didn't know
you could play that alone.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.547
Well, I don't
have any friends.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.715
(brakes squeal)

04:43.717 --> 04:44.883
Ow! Daddy!

04:44.885 --> 04:46.718
Wear your damn seat belt!

04:47.186 --> 04:50.022
Ernie, this is my son
Cleveland Jr.

04:50.024 --> 04:53.959
He doesn't have
any friends either.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.328
You want to play
kick the can?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.630
Do I?!

04:59.632 --> 05:01.933
That's okay. I didn't
get it at first either.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.503
I'll teach you how.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.370
All right.

05:05.372 --> 05:09.041
Now, you half-wits
have a good time.

05:40.073 --> 05:40.939
(chuckles)

05:40.941 --> 05:42.207
And then the old lady
was hobbling after us

05:42.209 --> 05:44.943
'cause the crab apple we threw
broke her windshield,

05:44.945 --> 05:49.047
and she tripped over a surveying
flag and landed in the mud!

05:49.049 --> 05:50.015
(laughter)

05:50.017 --> 05:52.818
I bet even she had
to laugh at that one.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.518
(chuckles)

05:53.520 --> 05:56.021
I tell you, Ernie,
it's nice having you here.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.756
Looks like I'm not
the only one

05:57.758 --> 05:59.925
around here with
a white boyfriend.

05:59.927 --> 06:00.926
(laughs)

06:00.928 --> 06:03.628
She's trying
to call you homosexuals,

06:03.630 --> 06:05.063
Cleveland Jr. and Ernie.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.064
That's funny.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.599
I'm gonna use that.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.134
I'm gonna use it right now.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.936
Y'all are homosexuals!

06:10.938 --> 06:12.838
(laughs)

06:12.840 --> 06:15.107
This has been a perfect day.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.212
Well, you know, Ernie,
the fun doesn't have to end.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.515
Why don't we have a good
old-fashioned sleepover?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.550
- Yeah!
- Really?!

06:25.552 --> 06:26.251
Sure!

06:26.253 --> 06:27.753
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

06:27.755 --> 06:30.522
Wow, your dad knows
janitor language!

06:30.524 --> 06:31.490
I love it here!

06:31.492 --> 06:32.624
Come on to my room, Ernie.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.927
We can look at our boogers
under the microscope!

06:35.929 --> 06:37.729
Cool!

06:39.966 --> 06:40.632
(sighs)

06:40.634 --> 06:42.834
You can go,
too, Cleveland.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.102
Cool!

06:45.238 --> 06:48.039
CLEVELAND:
Ho-ho! Gross!

06:51.477 --> 06:53.779
Hey, y'all. So what are
we grubbing on tonight?

06:53.781 --> 06:56.214
Oh, Ernie,
you're back for dinner.

06:56.216 --> 06:56.948
Again.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.885
Yep. You said I could
come over anytime,

06:59.887 --> 07:01.086
so I'm moving in.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.554
Well, that's not exactly
what I...

07:02.556 --> 07:05.023
If Cleveland Jr.'s boyfriend
gets to live here,

07:05.025 --> 07:06.758
then why can't mine?

07:06.760 --> 07:07.993
Okay, he can't live here,

07:07.995 --> 07:11.163
and Federline's definitely
not gonna live here!

07:11.165 --> 07:13.765
Ah, I sat on my nuts!

07:14.834 --> 07:15.734
(knocking)

07:15.736 --> 07:16.835
Can I help you?

07:16.837 --> 07:17.636
Hi, Lester.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.105
This is a little awkward,
but Ernie was talking about

07:20.107 --> 07:23.074
moving into my house,
and I figured you...

07:23.076 --> 07:23.842
That true, Ernie?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.744
You want to live here or there?

07:25.746 --> 07:26.845
There, I reckon.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.247
Eh, boy's all yours.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.248
(groans)

07:30.250 --> 07:31.750
Well, let's go home.

07:31.752 --> 07:36.221
I'll get out of these pants and
you can play with Cleveland Jr.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.559
I shouldn't talk to boys.

07:44.664 --> 07:45.764
I brought all my stuff!

07:45.766 --> 07:46.998
My kit, my kaboodle,
my doo-dads,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.301
my doo-hickies,
my doo-jiggers, my gee-gaws.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.771
(chuckles)
We're gonna
be roommates.

07:52.773 --> 07:53.605
Oh, perfect.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.774
Just what we need, another dude.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.709
Would it kill somebody
to bring home

07:57.711 --> 08:01.780
a hot Puerto Rican chick
who's into black midgets?

08:01.782 --> 08:04.883
And this is Princess,
my pet possum.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.084
(screams)

08:06.086 --> 08:07.152
Hide the cheese!

08:07.154 --> 08:09.921
Sorry, but I'm no good
at living with animals.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.091
Hey, big fat ugly
tumor head man,

08:13.093 --> 08:15.560
I'm going down
to the student center.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.862
You want a soda
or something?

08:16.864 --> 08:19.731
I am referred to as
the Elephant Man.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.132
You don't look like
an elephant.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.436
You look like a big fat
ugly tumor head man.

08:24.438 --> 08:28.940
This is not why they
call me the Elephant Man.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.008
(zipper unzips)

08:30.010 --> 08:33.245
(thump, trumpeting)

08:36.649 --> 08:37.849
Morning.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.787
Uh, could you at least

08:42.789 --> 08:44.823
run the water
while you're doing that?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.258
Okay.
(water running)

08:46.260 --> 08:47.058
Do y'all have a disposal,

08:47.060 --> 08:49.361
or should I do the rest
in the yard?

08:49.363 --> 08:51.930
Both.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.766
(shower running)

09:02.208 --> 09:03.208
(possum squeaking)

09:03.210 --> 09:06.378
(Donna screaming)

09:06.380 --> 09:07.746
Get off me!

09:07.748 --> 09:09.381
Is there room for two...

09:09.383 --> 09:11.716
(screaming)

09:11.718 --> 09:13.919
(possum squeaking)

09:15.922 --> 09:19.324
Hasta la possum, baby!

09:19.326 --> 09:20.859
(possum squealing)

09:20.861 --> 09:23.895
(Cleveland, Donna screaming)

09:30.636 --> 09:33.672
So... Lester,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.273
have you given
any further thought

09:35.275 --> 09:38.209
to when you might want
Ernie to return home?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.778
He can make
his own decisions.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.179
He's a grown-ass man.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.914
Lester, he's 14.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.016
You got to take back your boy.

09:45.018 --> 09:45.784
Why should I?

09:45.786 --> 09:48.219
Seems to me he's happy
anywhere but our house.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.689
Y'all can pay
for my drinks!

09:51.457 --> 09:52.791
So Cleveland,
how are you going

09:52.793 --> 09:54.559
to get Lester to
take his boy back?

09:54.561 --> 09:56.528
I guess I'll have
to get creative,

09:56.530 --> 09:59.998
like Van Gogh
when he discovered the Q-tip.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.001
Ew... waxy.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.736
What the hell
are you doing?!

10:04.738 --> 10:06.771
This is my business.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.541
Excuse me. This is
a private residence.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.876
CLEVELAND'S VOICE:
It's me, Cleveland.

10:11.878 --> 10:12.744
What?!

10:12.746 --> 10:13.678
What are you doing?

10:13.680 --> 10:14.913
I'm Lester from
the future.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.982
I'm going to visit him
in his sleep and tell him

10:16.984 --> 10:20.785
that without his influence,
Future Ernie will destroy NASCAR

10:20.787 --> 10:24.055
by making them drive
the other way around the track.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.458
Will you just call
Child Services?

10:26.460 --> 10:27.092
What?

10:27.094 --> 10:29.361
I don't want to get
Lester in trouble.

10:29.363 --> 10:30.829
You won't.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.229
Trust me.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.398
I had to call them
more than once with Robert.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.700
They'll come over,
sit Lester and Ernie down

10:35.702 --> 10:37.936
and force them
to talk this out.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.137
That makes sense.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.239
HOLT'S VOICE:
Dyn-o-mite!

10:41.241 --> 10:42.207
What the-- Holt?

10:42.209 --> 10:44.542
I figure you're
Lester, I'll be you.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.544
We may dress as you all,

10:46.546 --> 10:50.081
but you all may not
dress as us.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.485
(chicken clucking)

10:53.487 --> 10:54.686
There he goes!

10:54.688 --> 10:56.287
I got him!
I got him!

10:56.289 --> 10:57.155
(bones snap)
(both gasp)

10:57.157 --> 10:59.391
Dinner'll be ready
in half an hour.

10:59.393 --> 11:00.225
(doorbell rings)

11:00.227 --> 11:02.861
My, who could that be?

11:04.063 --> 11:06.798
Hi, I'm with Child
Protective Services.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.599
I'm here for Ernie.

11:07.601 --> 11:10.769
Ernie, this nice man
is gonna sit down

11:10.771 --> 11:13.471
with you and your dad
to have a talk.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.205
Okay.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.242
But we were gonna play
mine-shaft disaster

11:17.244 --> 11:18.476
in the crawlspace.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.111
I was gonna be
the greedy mine owner

11:20.113 --> 11:24.282
who turned a blind eye to
numerous safety violations.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.417
A: you can play later,

11:25.419 --> 11:28.787
and B: you know you can't fit
in that crawl space.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.056
I don't have to fit
in there, Daddy.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.524
I'm the owner
of the mine.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.592
I don't have to do
the dirty work.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.560
Plus, I already told you,

11:35.562 --> 11:37.729
I knew it was
dangerous in there...

11:37.731 --> 11:39.931
Ah-ya-ya-ya!
You can play later.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.710
Thank God you called us,
Mr. Brown!

11:51.712 --> 11:54.512
No child should live
in such conditions!

11:54.514 --> 11:56.147
(tires squeal)

11:56.449 --> 11:59.884
You called
Child Services on me?!

12:00.386 --> 12:02.887
How dare you!

12:02.889 --> 12:04.155
(squealing)

12:04.157 --> 12:05.490
Eh!

12:05.492 --> 12:07.158
Eh!
(squealing)

12:08.561 --> 12:10.328
(braying)
Eh!

12:13.466 --> 12:15.467
(gasps)

12:15.469 --> 12:17.035
Hmph!

12:31.083 --> 12:33.251
I feel terrible.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.154
Terrible, terrible,
terrible.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.255
I broke up a family

12:37.257 --> 12:40.125
and sent away
the only friend
Cleveland Jr. had.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.260
I know. I mean,
Lester's not perfect,

12:42.262 --> 12:44.662
but he <i>is </i> Ernie's father,
Cleveland.

12:44.664 --> 12:48.233
Whoa! Listen to you:
"He's Ernie's father."

12:48.235 --> 12:49.367
Yesterday, you were all:

12:49.369 --> 12:51.903
"Call Child Services.
Call Child Services.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.071
"They'll have
a conversation.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.406
Oh, maybe they'll hug it out.
Oh, that'll be great."

12:55.408 --> 12:57.142
Oh, that's only 'cause
you were all:

12:57.144 --> 13:00.879
"My kid is lonely.
He's a loser, blah-blah-blah.

13:00.881 --> 13:04.149
I gotta get him a friend.
Oh, I sat on my nuts."

13:04.151 --> 13:06.251
Uh-huh, and you're all:
"Oh, Cleveland,

13:06.253 --> 13:08.253
"even though we have
our differences,

13:08.255 --> 13:09.854
"I should probably
pleasure you

13:09.856 --> 13:11.222
"right here
in the kitchen,

13:11.224 --> 13:12.624
"any way you want.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.093
"Whatever makes you
feel good the fastest,

13:15.095 --> 13:17.262
so you can get out there
and reunite that family."

13:17.264 --> 13:19.597
And then you're, like:
"No, that's okay.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.199
"I'll just go
in the bathroom

13:21.201 --> 13:22.567
"and take care of myself
real quick,

13:22.569 --> 13:25.470
and then get out there
and bring Ernie home."

13:25.472 --> 13:29.140
Oh, man!
Why'd I have to say that?!

13:31.644 --> 13:33.378
(knocking)

13:33.380 --> 13:35.246
Lester, good news!

13:35.248 --> 13:38.183
I already heard.
We got a black president.

13:38.185 --> 13:38.917
I know.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.418
But this is
about Ernie.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.987
I called Child Services
and found out

13:42.989 --> 13:45.990
that they took him to a
foster family in Elmwood.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.359
But first, I listened
to their entire message

13:48.361 --> 13:51.930
because some of their menu
options may have changed.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.331
Anyway, they scheduled

13:53.333 --> 13:55.133
a custody hearing
for tomorrow morning.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.302
All you have to do
is come with me

13:57.304 --> 13:59.037
and we can get
your boy back.

13:59.039 --> 14:04.442
What about my six pigs,
my donkey, and my Port-O-John?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.347
I don't know what to do.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.615
Lester won't go to the hearing.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.218
It's like he doesn't even want
his son back.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.321
Am I the only one who
knows psychology here?

14:16.323 --> 14:17.488
No. I minored in it.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.023
Guess what I majored in.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.291
Partying?
There he is!

14:20.293 --> 14:23.194
The point is Lester
does want his son back,

14:23.196 --> 14:26.064
but he's too proud
and way too stupid...

14:26.066 --> 14:26.664
Oh, oh, Lester!

14:26.666 --> 14:30.201
We were just speaking
of a different Lester.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.403
In-in case you
did not hear,

14:32.405 --> 14:34.138
this-this other
Lester is stupid.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.073
Uh, sorry I'm late.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.243
I was busy turning Ernie's room
back into a panic room.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.011
Panic Room
with Forest Whitaker,

14:40.013 --> 14:42.080
who was in <i>Fast Times</i>
<i>with Sean Penn.</i>

14:42.082 --> 14:44.082
<i>Who was in</i>
<i>Mystic River with...</i>

14:44.084 --> 14:45.216
Kevin Bacon!
Yeah!

14:45.218 --> 14:46.451
In three!
Suck it!

14:46.453 --> 14:49.254
You know, Lester,
I-I like having a son

14:49.256 --> 14:51.289
just to do the chores
around the house

14:51.291 --> 14:53.157
that I, that I
don't want to do.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.294
Not to mention the tax break
you get for having a child.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.197
Taxes? I don't pay
no damn taxes.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.231
Screw the government.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.201
Well, the government is
who took your child away.

15:03.203 --> 15:07.071
See, Lester,
this isn't about Ernie.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.407
This is about
the government

15:09.409 --> 15:11.175
disrespecting you
as a man.

15:11.177 --> 15:14.646
You have to stand up
to the government, Lester.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.347
Show 'em who's boss.

15:17.483 --> 15:21.085
I'm gettin'
my son back!

15:21.087 --> 15:24.255
Vegas! Right now!
Right now!

15:24.257 --> 15:25.223
Vegas! Who's in?!

15:25.225 --> 15:28.426
I, I've never been
to Las Vegas.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.761
Let's do it!

15:29.763 --> 15:31.629
What the hell!

15:31.631 --> 15:33.631
All right, we just gotta
stop off at my house,

15:33.633 --> 15:37.101
grab my black shirt,
and get some cash from my mom.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.140
There he goes.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.141
Slight break.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.676
Oh, that's crisp.

15:44.678 --> 15:45.543
Whatcha think?

15:45.545 --> 15:48.212
Mm, You look
Waffle House handsome.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.348
No brunch after church,
today, ma'am.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.184
I got a hearing
to go to.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.260
Too much?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.561
Mm-mm, just right, baby.

16:03.563 --> 16:07.532
Now go get
that kid back.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.100
Hey, baby?

16:09.102 --> 16:12.403
You're right on time.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
Oh, hey, Lester.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.609
Are all of these
gun-toting rednecks coming

16:18.611 --> 16:19.644
to the hearing
with us?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.379
We ain't goin'
to no hearing.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.381
We gonna go to
that foster home

16:23.383 --> 16:24.615
and take my boy back!

16:24.617 --> 16:25.783
What are you talking about?

16:25.785 --> 16:28.252
I'm doing what
you told me to do--

16:28.254 --> 16:29.854
standing up to the government.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.289
Showing them who's boss.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.458
And no one's gonna stop me!

16:33.460 --> 16:37.295
(all hooting and cheering)

16:37.297 --> 16:39.964
(laughs nervously)

16:46.472 --> 16:50.308
I always found
Flip Wilson very funny.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.442
Me, too.

16:51.444 --> 16:55.013
You know who else
was classy?

16:55.015 --> 16:55.747
Ed Bradley.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.648
Ed Bradley was
a class act.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.551
Mm-hmm.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.619
I once became aroused

17:01.621 --> 17:04.489
while looking at Halle
Berry and her breasts.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.624
Thank you.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.263
Sons of Stoolbend,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.399
Most of you
are gonna die today.

17:14.401 --> 17:18.703
I  think I left
a cake in the oven!

17:18.705 --> 17:19.771
Fair enough.

17:19.773 --> 17:22.173
Now the rest of us are
gonna go in there

17:22.175 --> 17:26.744
and show the government
that they can't take my son!

17:26.746 --> 17:29.213
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

17:30.449 --> 17:32.650
Lester, please.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.252
Remember what
Kenny Rogers said

17:34.254 --> 17:36.154
right before he went
into the chicken business

17:36.156 --> 17:38.656
and then made himself look
like an old woman:

17:38.658 --> 17:42.193
"You don't have
to fight to be a man."

17:42.461 --> 17:44.462
All ri-ri-ri-right,
hold up, fellas!

17:44.464 --> 17:47.832
Cleveland and me is gonna try
talkin' to 'em.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.867
Y'all can wait outside.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.803
No sodomy!

17:51.805 --> 17:52.703
ALL:
Aw!

17:52.705 --> 17:56.240
Well, good thing I brought
Dancin' Dan.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.543
Look at him...
look, look at him.

17:58.545 --> 18:02.280
Please return Ernie
to his rightful father.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.882
You seem like perfectly
lovely people, but...

18:04.884 --> 18:05.450
Nope.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.485
The child is not going
back to that house.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.921
I ain't leavin'
without my son.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.389
(whistles)

18:12.091 --> 18:14.459
Where do you think
you're going?

18:14.461 --> 18:16.360
You're messing
with my livelihood.

18:16.362 --> 18:20.431
That foster kid is money
in my pocket!

18:21.800 --> 18:24.802
(slow-motion, distorted):
No...!

18:48.927 --> 18:52.263
Look, Lester obviously
cares enough about Ernie

18:52.265 --> 18:53.464
to risk his own life.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.266
Do I have brains
in my hair?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.901
No, you got it.
Do I?

18:56.903 --> 18:57.902
No, uh-uh.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.272
I'm gonna ask you once again
to reconsider.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.907
Clearly, Ernie and Lester
belong together.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.943
You're risking your life
just to get me home?

19:05.945 --> 19:08.312
But I thought you
didn't want me home.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.046
I never said that!

19:09.048 --> 19:10.948
You  said you didn't want
to live at home.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.885
I was only sayin' that
'cause you didn't say

19:13.887 --> 19:15.486
you wanted me
to come home.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.922
You thought...
and I meant...?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.690
Aw, don't that beat all.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.860
Okay, on three,
let's say it.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.329
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

19:25.331 --> 19:26.497
I love you!

19:26.499 --> 19:27.765
Ha! Wussy.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.769
Well, I have to admit...

19:31.771 --> 19:34.005
this new couple seems
to have a few...

19:34.007 --> 19:35.873
issues of their own.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.876
Foster kids, attack!

19:38.878 --> 19:40.411
(all yelling)

19:42.848 --> 19:45.249
Tell you what,
how 'bout if I promise

19:45.251 --> 19:47.418
to keep an eye...
on Ernie,

19:47.420 --> 19:49.287
since I'm just across
the street?

19:49.289 --> 19:49.854
All right, fine.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.391
Ernie can go home.
I'll sign the release.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.992
Great!
(gunshot)

19:54.994 --> 19:57.361
Great.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.432
Hey, Lester,
you got custody!

20:01.434 --> 20:05.403
Yee-yip-yip-yip-yip-haw!

20:06.371 --> 20:08.272
We'll take that kid now.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.707
CLEVELAND:
Chandel-where?!

20:09.709 --> 20:10.841
Chandel-what?!

20:10.843 --> 20:13.644
Chandel-here!

20:14.980 --> 20:15.713
You got a gun?!

20:15.715 --> 20:18.549
You think I'd get
in a truck full of rednecks

20:18.551 --> 20:21.052
without packing heat?

20:21.054 --> 20:23.254
(both laugh)

20:23.256 --> 20:23.955
You know what?

20:23.957 --> 20:24.922
You're all right.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.326
I take back all
the racist stuff
I said about you.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.560
What racist stuff?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.562
Oh, yeah.
You weren't there.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.265
You...!
(chuckles)

20:36.068 --> 20:36.968
I told you. Look.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.469
I left my I.D.
in Virginia.

20:38.471 --> 20:41.405
I'm 32, dawg.
Look at my class ring!

20:41.407 --> 20:44.775
Come on, man!
Please?

20:44.777 --> 20:47.878
Hey, Holt, Holt,
you-you gotta get in here, man.

20:47.880 --> 20:52.316
I think, I think, I think
I just made out
with Nikki Hilton!

20:52.318 --> 20:53.351
Oh, oh, my God.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.687
I-I-I-I don't know
what was in that aspirin

20:56.689 --> 20:58.422
that, uh, that, uh,
those Arab guys gave me,

20:58.424 --> 21:02.293
but it's the best freakin'
aspirin I've ever had!

21:02.295 --> 21:03.928
Whoo!
