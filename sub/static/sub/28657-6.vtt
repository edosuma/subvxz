00:29.586 --> 00:32.314
I'd forgotten it was Saturday.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.924
Someone's getting married.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.719
They're not coming back, are they?
The people who did this.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.199
They won't come back today, no.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.359
Have you called the police?

00:42.360 --> 00:44.519
Well, the department
are on their way.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.975
They'll be here any moment.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.644
It's only a dog that died.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.579
Hardly an emergency.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.491
Who did this, Mr Field?

00:55.760 --> 00:56.942
Come with me.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.080
Yes, you're still here.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.359
I thought you might want
to have some of them.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.815
So I'm going to pack up
this room last.

01:24.120 --> 01:27.302
You want to know who's responsible?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.999
What, all of them?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.040
We'll see.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.359
This young man, David,
is in fact my son, Anthony.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.906
But he says he's not, madam.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.159
There is a resemblance, of course.
I can see that.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.919
And I didn't realise
that yesterday, I admit.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.399
But this young man is David Harris.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.199
He's worked here for three years.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.473
He's not your son, madam.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.440
Anthony?

02:13.520 --> 02:15.439
My God!

02:15.440 --> 02:16.799
It is Anthony!

02:16.800 --> 02:19.719
Anthony, my boy!
You're back with us!

02:19.720 --> 02:21.639
This is my husband.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.879
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.759
I'm Richard Shaw,
I'm a Member of Parliament.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.679
I'm not these people's son.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.799
- I'm not!
- Don't worry, everybody.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.039
Please, we will take care of him.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.199
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.199
- Hey, hey, hey, no, get your hands off me!
- Don't treat him like that!

02:38.200 --> 02:40.847
I don't know these people.
I'm not their son, I'm not.

02:40.848 --> 02:43.048
Who on Earth are these men
and why are they here?

02:43.049 --> 02:45.116
I don't want us to risk
losing him again.

02:45.117 --> 02:47.874
- I thought I had to bring support.
- I trusted you, you promised me!

02:47.875 --> 02:49.399
It'll be all right
when we get home.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.999
- I'm not their son! Help me!
- It's all right.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.040
Thank you.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.440
Shut the door, please.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.559
There's only one glass.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.679
Give it to Samuel.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.499
I'll have the flask.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.568
Robert, are you OK?

03:30.400 --> 03:31.759
I'll be fine in a moment.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.239
I think, Mr Petrukhin,
you have a right to know everything

03:34.240 --> 03:35.519
we do about these people.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.639
About bloody time.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.839
And we'll make sure that
your house is safe so tomorrow

03:38.840 --> 03:40.959
you can bring your
family back there.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.239
But first I'd be delighted
if you'd be my guest at my club.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.199
Although, of course, I'd understand
if you don't want to help us any more.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.079
On the contrary.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.899
I want to do everything
I can to stop them.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.680
Come in. Come in, my boy.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.360
Anthony.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.382
Welcome home.

04:32.880 --> 04:33.971
I'm not him.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.455
I'm not Anthony.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.691
Have a good look round.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.608
Remind yourself of everything.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.240
Come.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.608
You must have missed all this.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.239
I know you don't believe me.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.422
I'm seeing this garden
for the very first time.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.839
Here are all your drawings
and paintings, Anthony.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.931
David - I will call you David.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.919
I didn't do any of these.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.519
Please listen to this.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.157
I am not your son.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.439
Do you think he really
doesn't remember?

05:26.440 --> 05:28.279
Or is it just playacting?

05:28.280 --> 05:30.079
I'm not sure.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.717
It's just the shock, I think.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.559
He's become somebody
else while he was away.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.599
He'll come back to us.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.879
Does he really want
us to call him David?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.039
Yes.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.199
But it won't last.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.799
Richard, we don't need all
these men now, do we, surely?

05:46.800 --> 05:49.399
Just for the moment,
till we're certain the press

05:49.400 --> 05:50.879
haven't got hold of it.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.959
They aren't the people who tore
down my posters, are they?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.359
Why would they have done that?

05:55.360 --> 05:57.039
To stop any publicity
about the family.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.399
No, of course not.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.599
And they'll be gone
very soon, I promise.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.119
We just need to guard
our privacy for a few

06:03.120 --> 06:04.319
more days, darling.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.719
But only for a few days.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.919
And he's not going to be a prisoner,
he's not going to be locked in.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.239
I feel such joy that
he's here, Richard.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.513
I don't want anything to spoil that.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.673
Mr Richardson.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.084
The Jew's back.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.371
An ingenious invention.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.239
So, this is the situation,
Mr Petrukhin.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.119
One can't go after people
for what they're thinking,

06:37.120 --> 06:39.079
for what they may
be imagining doing.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.759
Especially when what they really
think may be disguised

06:41.760 --> 06:45.039
by innocent-looking lectures
on Victorian buildings.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.999
Conspiracies are hard to prove.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.119
Two people have been killed already,
not to mention what happened today.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.150
Surely...

06:51.152 --> 06:54.239
An RAF man went
berserk on an airfield.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.759
He maintains he was acting
completely on his own

06:56.760 --> 06:58.959
and that he is mentally ill.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.519
And as for today, well,
a dog died during a burglary.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.399
So this is what we know,
Mr Petrukhin.

07:04.400 --> 07:10.079
There is a cabal of disaffected
people, a coalition between once

07:10.080 --> 07:13.079
important man who now feel
themselves sidelined,

07:13.080 --> 07:17.799
and a few members of my own service,
rogue officers from MI5 and MI6,

07:17.800 --> 07:20.839
who feel that there's massive
Russian penetration,

07:20.840 --> 07:22.239
not just in the Secret Service...

07:22.240 --> 07:24.719
But in the Foreign Office.
And at the heart of government.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.759
These people are determined
to take action to gain power

07:28.760 --> 07:30.159
and put their own man in place.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.799
And they think they've found their
perfect candidate in Richard Shaw.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.719
He's malleable, a charming chap
and extremely popular

07:37.720 --> 07:38.759
with the public.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.079
And to do this,
they're prepared to use force.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.639
So that they can alter the future
and stop the dismantling

07:44.640 --> 07:46.640
of the British Empire.

07:47.280 --> 07:51.099
We think that, through you,
Mr Petrukhin...

07:57.960 --> 08:02.324
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you, we'll do the rest.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.519
Yes. We think that, through you,
Mr Petrukhin, through

08:06.520 --> 08:09.559
your friendship with Richard Shaw
and Lord Wallington,

08:09.560 --> 08:11.999
that we can get the evidence
we need to stop them

08:12.000 --> 08:13.359
before they act.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.439
Because now they think
you're one of them.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.359
I don't think they feel that.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.559
Not yet, anyhow.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.279
Then you must make them believe it.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.799
Can you do that, Samuel?

08:22.800 --> 08:25.679
Can you disguise the way
you really feel?

08:25.680 --> 08:27.279
Not easily.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.599
It's not what I'm best at.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.079
I tend to show what I'm thinking.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.078
And if they start
pouring out anti-Semitic bile,

08:34.080 --> 08:39.717
and I just have to nod away,
then that's going to be very hard.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.958
And they won't
believe it, will they?

08:41.960 --> 08:45.359
You're a white Russian.
You want to fight the communists.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.199
That they will believe.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.999
If you make them.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.639
Also, we think they want
to use your pager as part

08:51.640 --> 08:53.839
of the operation they're planning.

08:53.840 --> 08:57.759
Anyway, isn't there one very big
problem with using me?

08:57.760 --> 08:59.719
You think that they're
connected to the gunmen.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.039
So how come, if they like you so
much, they want to kill you? Yes.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.559
Because they were after me
and William, and he bungled it.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.599
The shooter.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.199
I'd driven off,
but he still went ahead with it.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.839
You happened to be in
the wrong place, Samuel.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.359
We realise you've already done
a lot for us, Mr Petrukhin.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.239
You need to get back with
your family. Think it over.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.422
Yes, you must miss them.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.319
I'm sorry, Joel.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.593
I'm not ready to do this.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.359
Not today.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.815
Because it's me?

09:52.720 --> 09:54.079
You're not ready to do it with me?

09:54.080 --> 09:57.479
No, it's not because of you.
It really isn't.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.999
Esther brought a message
from the factory.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.999
My dad's going to be home tomorrow.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.919
And you're already
worrying about that?

10:03.920 --> 10:06.639
Yes, I want to be sure he's OK.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.439
And you wouldn't want
him to know about me?

10:09.440 --> 10:11.079
Not yet, no.

10:11.080 --> 10:16.262
I've hardly had a boyfriend
at all until now, let alone...

10:17.200 --> 10:21.559
I don't want to give him anything
else to worry about at the moment.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.359
Or ever?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.997
I didn't say that.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.559
We don't know what's
going to happen, do we?

10:28.560 --> 10:29.919
I mean, we could be...

10:29.920 --> 10:32.199
All blown up next week.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.110
The end of the world.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.879
Yes.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.920
I know.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.230
You keep saying that.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.520
Joel!

11:28.640 --> 11:29.720
Joel!

11:33.360 --> 11:34.520
Joel!

11:59.160 --> 12:00.200
Joel!

12:02.280 --> 12:03.320
Joel!

12:12.960 --> 12:14.779
We're arresting YOU.

12:15.520 --> 12:16.560
Over there.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.039
We're arresting you, young lady.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.039
That's ridiculous.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.080
Quiet.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.239
Cos you started this.
Isn't that right?

12:35.240 --> 12:38.059
No, that certainly isn't right.

12:38.480 --> 12:43.026
This is all because of
you and what you were doing.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.919
Well, you're all very lucky.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.119
We've been called to an incident.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.039
A much larger incident up the road.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.919
But if there's any more
trouble from any of you,

13:05.920 --> 13:07.399
we'll be back.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.484
There's a visitor for you.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.040
Hello.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.993
It IS Anthony.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.079
You know me, my boy.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.626
Of course you do.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.079
It's wonderful to see you.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.439
Welcome back.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.719
I don't know you, no.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.439
Of course you do. Say my name.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.168
I don't know your name. Why...

13:44.200 --> 13:46.519
I'm going to embrace you anyway.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.066
Or are you too old for that?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.146
Not too old for that, I see.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.920
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not him.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.919
Well, your voice is
different, certainly.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.920
But as for the rest...

14:10.600 --> 14:12.399
I know you remember me.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.719
Our fishing trips,
setting off in that wonderful

14:15.720 --> 14:17.799
old lorry - you, me and your father.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.599
The Musketeers!

14:19.600 --> 14:21.759
Remember, Anthony?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.879
I mean, David.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.839
Remember?

14:25.840 --> 14:28.239
Come on. Come on downstairs.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.519
We'll all have a drink together.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.066
Let the old times flood out.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.640
We'll probably all end up crying.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.171
I'm not him.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.637
What do you think?

14:43.840 --> 14:45.568
Of course it's him.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.870
Yes, of course it is.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.119
It's all an act.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.599
He'll come out of it.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.146
You think so?

14:56.080 --> 14:57.599
Well, he hasn't tried to run away.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.279
That's one thing.
But he just sits in his room.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.719
Won't come down
to have meals with us.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.266
Won't talk to us.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.797
I know you want me to be him.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.519
I can understand that.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.975
Of course I can.

15:17.920 --> 15:22.720
But I'm not Anthony.
You have to believe me.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.771
There you are, darling.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.959
What on Earth have
you done to yourself?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.199
What's happened to you?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.239
It's nothing.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.799
I tripped and fell, that's all.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.879
You haven't been in
a fight, have you?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.119
In a fight?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.559
No, of course not!

15:50.560 --> 15:53.039
So you weren't involved in this?

15:53.040 --> 15:54.639
It was near where Esther lives.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.731
It happened last night.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.479
No, Dad.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.119
I was not mixed up in any riots.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.919
You didn't see any of
this trouble, then?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.959
No, I didn't.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.959
I promise.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.759
It's so good to see you, Dad!

16:11.760 --> 16:14.639
Safe from whatever was going on.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.319
Yes.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.879
That's all over, isn't it, Samuel?

16:18.880 --> 16:21.153
That work you were doing?

16:22.120 --> 16:24.120
It is, yes. It's over.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.319
You'll not be doing any
more for the government?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.866
Or whoever these people are?

16:29.880 --> 16:30.999
I will not.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.040
No.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.079
Hello, Mum.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.599
I'm so glad you're back, dear.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.964
I'm so glad I'm back, too.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.571
What's the matter, Mum?

16:51.762 --> 16:54.190
I'm not sure your father's
telling me the truth

16:54.191 --> 16:55.959
about his work for the government.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.039
I have no idea what
it is they want him to do.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.559
But he said that's all over.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.379
It's not over. I know it isn't.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.519
Hannah!

17:05.520 --> 17:07.959
If I hadn't become this...

17:07.960 --> 17:10.999
timid creature, afraid to go out,
afraid to do anything at all,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.759
- really, this wouldn't have happened.
- What do you mean?

17:13.760 --> 17:17.398
If I hadn't become like this,
I would have gone with him every

17:17.400 --> 17:19.638
time he went to that house,
to the Shaws', and I could

17:19.640 --> 17:21.519
have stopped him getting involved.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.363
And I would know what
they've been saying to him,

17:24.364 --> 17:27.693
- what this is all about.
- What?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.839
I don't care how you got
that black guy, darling.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.113
At least you're not
becoming like me.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.399
He's here again. Do I throw him out?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.879
No.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.119
No, I was expecting him.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.279
You were expecting him?

17:57.280 --> 17:59.559
I thought you wanted nothing to do
with him ever again?

17:59.560 --> 18:01.379
Things have changed.

18:04.440 --> 18:08.399
So, Samuel, decision time.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.439
Yes.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.999
I've thought about what you've said,
and I think I can do it,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.559
what you asked.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.197
Making them believe
that I'm one of them.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.759
Hello, it's Samuel Petrukhin.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.239
Samuel, there you are!

18:24.240 --> 18:26.799
I was just thinking
about you, as it happens.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.279
You were? That's good to know.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.199
I was just calling Kathleen, I thought
you'd be in the House of Commons.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.319
No, I'm at home because,
well, something quite

18:36.320 --> 18:38.593
sensational has happened.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.719
Kathleen's found Anthony,
and he's here,

18:41.720 --> 18:44.119
- here in the house, with us.
- That's amazing news.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.439
At least, we think it's him.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.959
Well, of course it's him.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.959
But he maintains he doesn't know us
and his name is David.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.479
He's calling himself David now?

18:52.480 --> 18:55.119
Anyway, you must come
down immediately and see us.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.799
Maybe he'll open up
to a stranger, you never know.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.799
And you're always welcome, Samuel.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.039
- Come tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

19:03.040 --> 19:04.759
I think I can do that, yes.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.800
Splendid!

19:08.520 --> 19:10.079
They found their son, they think.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.199
They think?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.399
The boy's denying it, is he?

19:12.400 --> 19:13.639
Yes.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.079
That makes it even more urgent.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.559
They'll bring things forward.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.399
Their plans, before the press get
hold of the story about Anthony

19:19.400 --> 19:23.673
and they become the focus
of national attention.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.519
- Mr Petrukhin.
- Go through.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.919
Sam, there you are!

19:33.920 --> 19:35.399
You've heard our wonderful news?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.999
I have. It's amazing.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.759
Richard's just bringing
him down to see you.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.999
You like yours with lemon,
don't you? The Russian way.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.119
Please.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.719
I'm so happy, Samuel.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.959
I can't tell you how happy I am.
Even though...

19:47.960 --> 19:49.959
Even though he doesn't
seem to recognise us,

19:49.960 --> 19:51.559
says he's never been here before.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.439
Well, he's still in shock.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.399
But I've got a plan
for what to do next.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.519
Right.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.611
You always have a plan.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.119
Here he is!

20:00.120 --> 20:02.519
Samuel, this is Anthony.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.439
This is Mr Petrukhin,
the inventor of the bleeper.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.259
We'll all be wearing them soon.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.757
So good to meet you, Anthony.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.159
David.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.433
If he wants to be David,
we must call him David.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.826
Let's go and feed
the donkeys, shall we?

20:23.240 --> 20:26.759
You remember their names,
don't you, David?

20:26.760 --> 20:28.919
I don't know their names, no.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.039
How could I?

20:30.040 --> 20:32.039
Never seen them before this week.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.999
Well, this one's Chich - Chichester.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.079
And that's Clemmie and
Margot and Daphne.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.999
You loved them.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
You always loved them.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.079
If I run away,
they would just come after me.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.879
And they'll keep me a prisoner.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.719
They won't listen
that I'm not their son.

20:53.720 --> 20:58.811
If you're their friend,
then maybe you can persuade them?

21:03.320 --> 21:05.048
What was he saying?

21:05.880 --> 21:07.999
That he's not Anthony.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.359
I know.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.879
He won't let this
other identity drop.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.426
Not for a moment.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.640
But he will eventually, I'm sure.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.513
It's so good you're here.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.719
In an hour or so,
I'm going on a little trip

21:23.720 --> 21:24.993
down the road.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.419
Do you want to come?

21:30.800 --> 21:33.319
Marvellous to drive
oneself for once.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.719
So, where are we going?

21:34.720 --> 21:39.359
I'm taking a bit of a risk
showing you this, Samuel.

21:39.360 --> 21:45.270
But you mustn't leap to conclusions
or think the world's gone mad.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.040
We're in.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.239
More woods?

22:02.240 --> 22:05.439
Yes, I like taking you
into the woods, Samuel.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.440
They're always full of surprises.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.559
So, what do you think
we'll find in this wood, Samuel?

22:14.560 --> 22:18.288
Another prewar lorry,
stuffed with whisky?

22:39.480 --> 22:45.117
My favourite Member of
Parliament and my favourite Russian!

22:45.680 --> 22:48.839
Welcome, Samuel, to our
picnic in the woods.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.519
Picnic? Is that what this is?

22:51.520 --> 22:53.959
Indeed it is, yes. Look here.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.119
Cheese, wine, smoked salmon.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.359
Bet you've never eaten
any of those off a tank before.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.759
They have to have something
to munch on, these generals,

23:01.760 --> 23:03.359
while they play with their toys.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.479
And they can do that
till their heart's content here.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.119
Away from prying eyes.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.159
Mr Petrukhin.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.524
Good afternoon.

23:11.526 --> 23:15.959
You weren't expecting to see these beauties
at the edge of the wood, were you?

23:15.960 --> 23:17.839
I certainly was not.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.279
Well, we're just about to give
a few of these vehicles a spin.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.799
We've got to keep exercising them.
Must never neglect them.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.079
And they can still
put on quite a show.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.444
I bet they can.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.055
Welcome to my private army.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.079
Is that what this is?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.199
A private army?

23:37.200 --> 23:38.999
Well, I don't know
if I'd call it that.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.246
There are quite a few
people here who served

23:41.247 --> 23:43.719
with the general in the war
and are loyal to him.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.239
They have a lot of shared memories
of being in action together.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.239
Makes you very close, of course.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.279
We're just here to enjoy the food...

23:51.280 --> 23:54.826
while watching
war games in the wood.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.559
Sometimes, it's hard for people
to let the past go,

24:16.560 --> 24:20.959
they're always wanting
to relive the old battles.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.759
- Is that what you're thinking, Samuel?
- Maybe.

24:24.760 --> 24:29.599
I was also thinking that there may
be a serious purpose to all this.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.279
That it's not just nostalgia.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.735
Old soldiers playing games.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.919
What do you mean by that, Samuel?

24:37.920 --> 24:40.559
Well, there could be a time
when a country is out of control,

24:40.560 --> 24:43.959
say, or the government is taking
completely the wrong direction

24:43.960 --> 24:48.039
or has been infiltrated
by a foreign power.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.999
And there may be a need
for someone like General Maddox

24:51.000 --> 24:53.239
and his private army.

24:53.240 --> 24:57.079
Even if it is just to help
concentrate people's minds.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.720
You mean help them see sense?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.359
Yes.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.179
That's what I meant.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.999
But above all, we can't let
the Reds take over.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.040
Can we?

25:11.800 --> 25:16.346
Helping people see sense
is often a very good idea.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.640
I agree.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.199
Petrukhin, come here! There's
someone waiting for you in the hall.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.746
Come on, quickly!

25:42.720 --> 25:44.440
This is important.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.199
Mrs Shaw?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.919
Hello, Sasha.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.919
I want you to meet someone.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.719
This is Anthony.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.266
So you found him?

25:55.200 --> 25:57.291
How do you do, Anthony?

25:58.480 --> 25:59.639
David.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.004
They haven't found
Anthony, I'm sorry.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.079
He likes to be called David now.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.839
Sasha helped us look for
information about you, David.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.295
Mr Tezler will see you now.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.942
Wait here for us, won't you, Sasha?

26:21.160 --> 26:25.079
So, Anthony.
How very good to see you.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.262
Welcome back.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.826
I'm David Harris.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.590
And I've never been here before.

26:33.720 --> 26:37.357
David has...
That's what he's called now.

26:37.480 --> 26:42.039
David has become a vegetarian and he
was working at the Vegetarian Hotel.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.859
Were you indeed?

26:44.880 --> 26:46.839
I should be there now.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.519
But they came and took me away.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.799
We've come here to bring back
some memories for David.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.559
Show him the past.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.879
I know he often mentioned
you, Mr Tezler.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.319
Yes, of course.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.279
You look rather different,
Anthony...

27:01.280 --> 27:02.479
David.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.039
But of course I haven't seen
you since you came here to visit

27:05.040 --> 27:07.040
when you were... 15.

27:09.520 --> 27:13.611
But I probably look
exactly the same, don't I?

27:15.120 --> 27:17.559
I've never seen you before, sir.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.197
You really don't remember me?

27:21.800 --> 27:22.891
Still David.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.119
We're going to go and have
a look around the school now.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.399
See if that has any effect.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.719
Would you like to come, Sasha?

27:28.720 --> 27:32.266
I'm afraid I need
a word with Petrukhin.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.239
I feel uncomfortable, Petrukhin,
because I have not been entirely

27:38.240 --> 27:39.999
truthful with you.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.359
For all sorts of reasons,
people who should know better

27:43.360 --> 27:46.679
sometimes do not tell the truth.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.239
Maybe we should even
use the word lie.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.279
Sir?

27:50.280 --> 27:54.919
I lied to you, Petrukhin,
about Anthony Shaw's letters.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.159
I showed you how Anthony had
written to me for many years.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.759
What I didn't tell you was that
some of those letters were

28:01.760 --> 28:04.124
from after he disappeared.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.808
I removed them from this file.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.159
That was the lie I told you -

28:10.160 --> 28:13.239
that he never wrote
to me after he vanished.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.999
I knew where he was.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.599
He wanted me to keep that secret.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.959
To tell no-one.

28:19.960 --> 28:24.779
It was desperately important to him,
so I told no-one.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.159
- You want to know why?
- Yes, sir.

28:28.160 --> 28:33.439
Cos we had an understanding
about animals and the natural world.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.079
We shared a horror of what is
happening to that world.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.319
The big game hunters,
the killing of lions,

28:40.320 --> 28:42.799
tigers and elephants.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.999
The blood sports here even,
like the fox hunt that comes

28:46.000 --> 28:48.479
across our school grounds.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.519
He was one of the very few boys
I ever taught that had a deep

28:51.520 --> 28:53.439
interest in that.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.077
The destruction of our world.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.819
Most boys like guns, of course.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.199
You look surprised, Petrukhin.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.959
I didn't know you were
interested in that, sir.

29:06.960 --> 29:10.119
I mean, I knew you minded about the
dead rabbits in the wood, but...

29:10.120 --> 29:11.799
No, I don't talk about it a lot.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.679
I don't like to preach about it.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.159
So I did what Anthony asked.

29:16.160 --> 29:21.119
I told myself, if he knew
I wasn't going to give him away,

29:21.120 --> 29:25.079
then he would keep writing to me
and I would know he was safe

29:25.080 --> 29:28.599
and less likely to do
harm to himself.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.799
And I have no idea if that
was the right thing to do.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.239
I don't know, sir.

29:33.240 --> 29:36.759
And now this man,
who does look like Anthony,

29:36.760 --> 29:39.579
claims he doesn't recognise me.

29:40.480 --> 29:45.026
I doubt we shall ever know
if what I did was right.

29:45.080 --> 29:48.640
And that worries me
terribly, Petrukhin.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.079
Russia uses the Red Square
parade as a shop window of

30:11.080 --> 30:13.319
the new weapon she is prepared
to show the world.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.639
This year, it includes
some rocket missiles -

30:15.640 --> 30:17.359
short and intermediate range.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.039
Dad? I thought you'd gone to bed?

30:20.040 --> 30:21.239
No.

30:21.240 --> 30:24.513
I have a lot to think about, Hannah.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.439
The bruise is getting better, I see.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.531
It is, thank God. So clumsy of me.

30:30.600 --> 30:34.599
I was terrified I'd still look
like this when I hold my party.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.399
I've got to hold
a party of some sort,

30:36.400 --> 30:38.079
Dad, before the season ends.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.439
It's expected, apparently.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.199
You can have a party.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.479
- Of course. God knows.
- Where we'd do it.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.999
I don't know what happens
if I don't have one.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
Get a curse put on me for the
rest of my life, probably.

30:53.440 --> 30:58.168
You haven't told me the truth
about how you got this.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.935
But don't worry.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.559
I haven't told the truth
to your mother, either.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.015
About what, Dad?

31:06.920 --> 31:10.011
About what I've got involved with.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.479
About it being finished.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.117
Isn't it finished?

31:14.760 --> 31:16.239
What else do you have to do?

31:16.240 --> 31:18.150
I shouldn't tell you.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.175
But I have to tell someone.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.159
You mustn't breathe a word of this.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.433
Of course not.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.359
Go on, Dad, please.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.639
I'm having to deal with people
that I never thought I'd come

31:30.640 --> 31:32.279
into contact with.

31:32.280 --> 31:36.239
Mad generals with private
armies in the woods

31:36.240 --> 31:40.919
with their own tanks
and soldiers playing war games.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.119
And they have these dreams
of running the country,

31:44.120 --> 31:47.399
of saving the British Empire,
of taking over the government.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.219
Generals with tanks?

31:50.440 --> 31:51.559
What do you have to do?

31:51.560 --> 31:55.924
It's not going to be dangerous, is it, Dad?
No.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.679
It's not very complicated.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.479
Don't worry, I think I can do it.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.519
Can I do anything to help?

32:03.520 --> 32:04.799
No, dear.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.982
In this case, you can't.

32:08.040 --> 32:12.480
OK, there's an array
of goodies in here.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.559
All of this equipment
looks pretty old.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.759
Indeed it is.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.239
Most of it is out of date.

32:19.240 --> 32:23.559
This, for instance - a tape recorder
inside that briefcase.

32:23.560 --> 32:24.759
Try lifting it.

32:24.760 --> 32:25.800
Go on.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.199
Good lord!

32:29.200 --> 32:31.359
- It weighs a tonne.
- Yes.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.559
Imagine struggling round,
trying to record somebody

32:33.560 --> 32:35.079
secretly with that.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.119
But this is much better.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.939
This is what you'll be wearing.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.159
That's more like it.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.439
I'd have thought you'd have
even smaller ones by now?

32:46.440 --> 32:48.622
No, not yet, I'm afraid.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.319
And...

32:51.320 --> 32:53.999
the microphone for this tape
recorder is inside this watch.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.919
So if people admire
your new watch...

32:55.920 --> 32:57.759
You'd better have
a good explanation.

32:57.760 --> 32:58.800
Precisely.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.959
And this is the harness
you'll be wearing.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.879
You'll need to get
comfortable with this.

33:04.880 --> 33:05.959
You need to practise.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.559
I bloody well will practise,
because the risk of them noticing

33:08.560 --> 33:09.799
must be quite high.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.839
The difficult thing, of course,
is changing the tape.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.279
I have to change the tape as well?

33:15.280 --> 33:17.319
Yes, they only last for an hour.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.519
You'll need more than
that on the day.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.959
What will happen with the tapes?

33:20.960 --> 33:23.359
Yes, well, they can't be
used in a court of law,

33:23.360 --> 33:25.799
of course, but the government
can use them to confront

33:25.800 --> 33:28.639
these people, strip them
of their positions and livelihood,

33:28.640 --> 33:30.199
expose them in the press.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.759
And we will manage to get
some of them sent to jail.

33:32.760 --> 33:36.159
But all of them will
be disgraced, ruined.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.999
- All of them?
- Yes, all of them.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.919
Then the Shaw family will be ruined?

33:39.920 --> 33:41.159
Absolutely.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.599
I know you admire
Mr and Mrs Shaw very much.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.146
Adore them, even.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.439
But you mustn't let
that get in the way.

33:48.440 --> 33:51.519
You can't feel free
to warn Richard Shaw,

33:51.520 --> 33:53.520
or anything like that.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.680
Nicolas, there you are, at last!

34:03.680 --> 34:06.199
God, it's so good to see you!

34:06.200 --> 34:08.399
It's so good to see you, too.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.491
That's some welcome there, Hannah.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.998
What happened here?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.918
Don't ask.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.359
So it didn't work out in Florence?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.815
Not exactly, no.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.119
I thought I was in
love with somebody.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.120
Turns out I was wrong.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.639
And who was this person?

34:28.639 --> 34:31.731
Somebody a little older than I am.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.998
But in the end, not nearly as wise.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.273
That's what I discovered.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.342
It was a man.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.998
You're not surprised?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.518
No.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.520
I had sort of guessed.

34:50.360 --> 34:53.998
You once said to me,
"We all have our secrets."

34:54.000 --> 34:55.839
Yes, I did.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.119
This is true.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.759
- You're going to what?
- You heard.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.959
You're going to infiltrate their
meeting and tape them secretly?

35:01.960 --> 35:06.119
I am not infiltrating, I am
attending with Mr Shaw as his guest.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.001
They believe you support
their cause, do they?

35:08.002 --> 35:10.039
Do you really think they're
going to fall for that?

35:10.040 --> 35:11.519
They already have, I think.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.559
You think?

35:12.560 --> 35:14.427
That's hardly going to
be good enough, is it?

35:14.428 --> 35:18.199
- Not with these people!
- Are you going to help me or not?

35:18.200 --> 35:19.239
Of course I am.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.359
What I really need to talk
to you about is this.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.959
I want your advice about my father.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.919
I'm so worried about him.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.599
He's got sort of entangled
doing some really odd work

35:27.600 --> 35:31.319
for the government,
the Secret Service.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.439
The Secret Service?

35:32.440 --> 35:34.799
Yes, I shouldn't be telling
you this, but I just can't stop

35:34.800 --> 35:35.933
thinking about it.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.134
And you're the only one
that knows about these things.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.227
You know about everything,
Nicolas, don't you?

35:40.228 --> 35:41.524
Maybe almost everything.

35:41.525 --> 35:45.279
My dad's got involved with these
mad bonkers generals who have tanks,

35:45.280 --> 35:48.079
their own tanks, and private
armies in the woods.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.353
And they have plans to...

35:51.400 --> 35:53.319
What's the matter,
don't you believe me?

35:53.320 --> 35:56.559
- Who are you looking for?
- No, no, I'm listening.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.399
Don't worry.

35:58.400 --> 36:02.959
It's just I said I'd meet one
of Max Dennis' producers here.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.359
Max Dennis' producer?

36:05.360 --> 36:08.679
- Really? You mean the comic on TV?
- Yes.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.519
Are you writing for him, then?

36:10.520 --> 36:11.639
Giving him jokes?

36:11.640 --> 36:12.800
No, not yet.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.279
It's just I sent this producer
some sketches and things and he said

36:17.280 --> 36:19.599
he liked them. And would I like
to meet here this evening.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.039
But I was already meeting you.
I didn't want to move it, so...

36:22.040 --> 36:23.999
So you're having two meetings
at once instead?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.119
Well, sort of,
except he's not here yet.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.479
It would be terrific if you
got to write for Max Dennis.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.439
Didn't know you were
that funny, Nicolas.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.259
You're probably right, I'm not.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.039
I don't want to ruin your chance.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.159
We'll meet another time.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.888
No, don't be silly.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.599
Anyway, he's not here yet.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.279
I want to hear about
mad generals in the woods.

36:48.280 --> 36:52.462
That's definitely something
I don't know about.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.119
Can you help me do
the waistcoat up, please?

36:57.120 --> 36:58.484
Yes, of course.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.519
You read about these things,
but you don't realise

37:02.520 --> 37:04.039
how clumsy they are.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.040
And difficult to wear.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.519
Can you see any trace of it?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.066
Move about a bit.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.815
It's the sleeve.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.199
You have to be careful
when you reach for things.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.759
Yes, I'll have to wear
it here at the office,

37:24.760 --> 37:26.719
get used to it over
the next five days.

37:26.720 --> 37:27.919
It's in five days?

37:27.920 --> 37:29.439
I got the invitation this morning.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.239
They've given you no
training or anything!

37:31.240 --> 37:33.279
It shouldn't be up to you,
it really shouldn't.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.679
- These people have to be stopped.
- But what if you're caught?

37:36.680 --> 37:39.771
I'm not going to think about that.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.799
There he is!

37:46.800 --> 37:49.519
You're marvellously
on time, as always.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.759
Hello, Samuel.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.319
How did you get here?

37:52.320 --> 37:53.439
I came by train.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.199
You said the less cars, the better.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.559
So I did.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.359
Have some home-made
lemonade and cake.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.359
You've got to tuck in.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.599
You've seen my son, Samuel,
a rare sight of him

38:05.600 --> 38:06.839
out of the house.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.519
Maybe this is the start
of something?

38:08.520 --> 38:11.159
Perhaps next week
he'll be here with us?

38:11.160 --> 38:13.479
You think we can
all be a family again?

38:13.480 --> 38:15.439
Sitting down at meals together?

38:15.440 --> 38:18.759
I don't know, he still
maintains he's David,

38:18.760 --> 38:20.759
that he doesn't remember any of us.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.079
But today he's not
skulking in his room,

38:23.080 --> 38:25.626
and that's good, definitely.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.559
Do you have your camera
with you, Samuel?

38:28.560 --> 38:30.079
Your splendid camera?

38:30.080 --> 38:31.999
You could take a picture.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.279
I'm afraid I don't.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.371
So no cameras today, Samuel, then?

38:47.000 --> 38:50.079
Off you go to your
important meeting.

38:50.080 --> 38:56.717
No doubt you'll spend the entire time
gossiping and talking about cricket.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.719
Come on, Samuel!
You're going to be late now.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.811
Just coming.

39:11.240 --> 39:16.079
Samuel, I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.808
Thank me? For what?

39:18.600 --> 39:20.559
For your support.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.079
For listening to me.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.919
For giving me hope.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.039
I didn't do any of
those things, did I?

39:26.040 --> 39:27.559
Yes, you did.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.197
Of course you did.

39:30.680 --> 39:35.879
I know it's an odd situation
with him refusing to recognise us,

39:35.880 --> 39:38.879
and no doubt it'll drive me crazy
if it goes on very much longer,

39:38.880 --> 39:42.971
and we may have to get
a psychiatrist for him.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.837
But he's here now.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.839
And it's already had an
extraordinary effect on me.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.119
All sorts of thoughts are buzzing -

39:52.120 --> 39:56.759
what I'm going to do differently,
how I'm going to change my life,

39:56.760 --> 39:59.599
how I'm going to be more engaged
with what's going on out there.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.719
Sounds exciting.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.279
It is, isn't it?

40:02.280 --> 40:04.190
We really have to go.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.382
So thank you.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.439
Don't stay any longer
than you need to, darling.

40:14.440 --> 40:15.479
Of course not.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.935
I'll tell them to get
a bloody move on.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.095
Big day, Samuel.

40:48.640 --> 40:54.004
I thought I'd seize this chance
to say something to you all.

40:54.960 --> 40:59.319
Mr Samuel, together with his father,
took a lot of risks to establish

40:59.320 --> 41:02.775
this firm and develop
their inventions.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.439
And Mr Samuel continues to take
risks on all our behalf.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.999
And I just wanted to pay
tribute to that today,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.439
for us to acknowledge that.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.919
And for us to wish him luck...

41:15.920 --> 41:18.375
in all business matters.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.239
Mr Shaw.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.879
I'm afraid no cars
are allowed in today.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.479
You need to walk from here.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.520
Walk?

41:36.600 --> 41:37.639
Even me?

41:37.640 --> 41:38.913
Even you, sir.

41:44.160 --> 41:48.251
I'm so glad you're here
with me today, Samuel.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.159
Thank you.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.159
I have no idea what
to expect, really.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.959
It'll be interesting.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.688
I promise you that.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.999
There she is.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.879
The RAF used to own her.

42:03.880 --> 42:06.199
Bomber Command was here
during the war.

42:06.200 --> 42:10.999
I think the general and his friends
got her dirt cheap.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.759
We could always go for a hearty meal
at a little pub instead.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.124
Skip the meeting entirely.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.666
Tempting, Samuel.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.320
Very tempting.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.553
Not possible, I'm afraid.

42:36.280 --> 42:39.735
Come on, we seem
to be almost the last.

42:40.600 --> 42:46.146
Haven't got one of those
to check in, have you, Samuel? -

42:55.320 --> 42:59.199
There you are! For a moment,
I almost thought you weren't coming.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.039
Good afternoon, Samuel.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.319
Welcome to our little gathering.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.159
Quite a distinguished guest list,
in fact.

43:06.160 --> 43:10.160
There's a duke over there,
a couple of lords.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.639
Several reliable members
of the Secret Service.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.559
So many of them want to meet you.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.399
Meet me? Why on earth
would they want to meet me?

43:18.400 --> 43:21.919
Mr Petrukhin, the Bleeper Man.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.439
Welcome indeed.
So glad that you agreed to join us.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.359
Got it with you in your pocket,
I see, your pager machine.

43:28.360 --> 43:30.759
A lot of people want to hear
about that.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.279
Excellent.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.462
The Bleeper Man is here, everybody.

43:35.720 --> 43:37.559
So many people want
to find out how it works.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.119
See, Samuel?
At last, you've managed it.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.639
Everybody wants
the staff locator now.

43:42.640 --> 43:46.079
Dukes, lords, generals.

43:46.080 --> 43:49.808
Now, you really must get
yourself a drink.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.359
Everybody on the terrace!

43:53.920 --> 43:57.284
This is the bit I've been
waiting for.

44:04.320 --> 44:08.502
Right, everyone's
eyes on the woods over there.

44:21.840 --> 44:25.750
Told you I could
make a wood move, didn't I?

44:43.440 --> 44:45.319
Yes? Can I help you?

44:45.320 --> 44:47.560
Can I help you, Mary?

44:49.440 --> 44:52.986
You can at least say my name,
can't you?

44:53.680 --> 44:57.953
I think it's time you
and I had a word together.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.639
About what?

45:00.640 --> 45:04.319
About what you're doing
to your mother and father.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.919
Keeping this up the whole time.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.739
Pretending to be somebody else.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.879
I'm not Anthony, I keep telling you.

45:12.880 --> 45:16.426
Do you think I'm blind,
as well as deaf?

45:17.000 --> 45:18.999
Do you think because I sit
in a corner all day

45:19.000 --> 45:23.439
that I don't see anything
or understand anything?

45:23.440 --> 45:25.199
Like your father's drinking

45:25.200 --> 45:29.473
and his endless talk
with Arthur about politics?

45:29.760 --> 45:31.079
Or your mother's grief?

45:31.080 --> 45:35.039
Do you think we don't all wonder
about disappearing somewhere,

45:35.040 --> 45:36.799
changing our lives?

45:36.800 --> 45:39.199
I know I have many times.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.719
I don't know what you mean.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.079
What you did was quite brave,
really.

45:43.080 --> 45:46.119
Braver than any of us.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.599
Utterly ruthless, of course.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.679
Brutal, even.

45:50.680 --> 45:54.317
But you made the break,
like I never did.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.382
- I'm not Anthony.
- Ssh!

45:59.560 --> 46:02.119
You got away from this house.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.959
This house that was always
full of Arthur's politics.

46:05.960 --> 46:08.839
You didn't want to be a part of it.
Of course you didn't.

46:08.840 --> 46:10.359
So you got away.

46:10.360 --> 46:14.319
You disappeared,
where no-one could find you.

46:14.320 --> 46:18.359
I may be wrong about your reasons,

46:18.360 --> 46:21.600
but I'm sure of this.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.199
You are Anthony.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.959
You are the boy I liked so much.

46:27.960 --> 46:31.480
Who spent many lazy afternoons
with me.

46:32.920 --> 46:36.919
Who was always calm, always gentle.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.800
And kind to me.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.888
And I have missed you incredibly,
Anthony.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.953
More than you could
possibly imagine.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.319
Hello, Mr Petrukhin.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.799
Hello.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.710
Over here, my friend.

47:04.640 --> 47:08.079
I'm just making a few final
adjustments for my speech.

47:08.080 --> 47:10.479
You're making a speech, Richard?

47:10.480 --> 47:12.479
Yes. I have to.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.439
I'm the star turn today, I'm afraid,

47:14.440 --> 47:17.559
so I have to make sure
I perform well.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.839
And I'm managing
to keep off the alcohol.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.999
What would happen
if you had a drink now?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.239
I don't think
we should dwell on that.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.439
Wouldn't stop at one.

47:26.440 --> 47:29.079
Would probably result in me
doing the speech on all fours,

47:29.080 --> 47:30.719
crawling across the stage.

47:30.720 --> 47:32.639
Maybe just one wouldn't do any harm.

47:32.640 --> 47:36.279
You keep tempting me, my friend,
to skip the whole thing.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.639
First the trip to the pub
and now this. Why?

47:39.640 --> 47:41.639
Well, I didn't think today
was that important.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.799
Well, you were wrong.
Don't be fooled.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.439
I may seem like I don't take
too much seriously these days,

47:46.440 --> 47:48.719
but in actual fact,
the complete opposite is true.

47:48.720 --> 47:49.470
Is it?

47:49.472 --> 47:51.719
Yes. I believe
there is something very wrong

47:51.720 --> 47:53.839
in how the world is now.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.239
I believe the empire
has to be saved.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.559
It can't just be given away.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.479
And, of course, the Russians
have to be driven out of Europe.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.479
And that means we have to
change things here.

48:03.480 --> 48:05.879
Richard, you don't have to talk about this now.
- Don't I?

48:05.880 --> 48:09.199
Well, I rather feel I do, because
you don't seem to understand.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.960
Hello, you two.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.239
What doesn't Samuel understand?

48:14.240 --> 48:18.279
He doesn't understand quite
how serious this meeting today is.

48:18.280 --> 48:21.799
Really?
I thought we'd made that clear.

48:21.800 --> 48:25.439
Well, I wasn't sure. There are so
many people here. I didn't know...

48:25.440 --> 48:27.799
What, if they can all be thinking the same thing?
- Exactly.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.959
Indeed they are. This is the plan.

48:29.960 --> 48:34.142
- The plan?
- It is gloriously straightforward.

48:36.160 --> 48:39.615
I noticed you have a new watch,
Samuel.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.199
You're very observant. Yes, I do.

48:42.200 --> 48:43.439
Very up to date.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.359
Hannah got it for me.
My birthday present.

48:46.360 --> 48:49.359
Hannah. What a lovely present
from your daughter.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.799
Expensive, too.

48:50.800 --> 48:55.346
Yes. I think her mother
lent her some of the money.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.959
Do you want to hear the plan?

48:57.960 --> 48:59.280
Of course.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.199
So, Samuel, what is proposed
is this -

49:06.200 --> 49:08.719
to encircle London Airport
with tanks.

49:08.720 --> 49:11.639
Not just General Maddock's
private army,

49:11.640 --> 49:16.079
but two other regiments
we know we can mobilise.

49:16.080 --> 49:20.639
We will also be encircling three
other strategically important sites.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.879
These locations, by the way,

49:22.880 --> 49:25.279
are about to request
your pager system.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.199
Unwittingly helping us.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.359
I have used my influence to make
sure that that happens.

49:30.360 --> 49:34.639
And that will be very important
operationally on the day.

49:34.640 --> 49:38.119
Which, of course, explains
why you're here, Samuel.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.479
I see. Makes sense.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.919
They can't be listened into,
like radio.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.359
Absolutely.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.159
That's right.

49:46.160 --> 49:48.559
And what are these tanks
going to do, Arthur?

49:48.560 --> 49:50.879
- They don't need to do anything.
- Don't they?

49:50.880 --> 49:53.999
The public will be told although
there are tanks on the street,

49:54.000 --> 49:57.679
it is all an exercise
to protect national security.

49:57.680 --> 50:01.759
But the government will realise that
the airport and these other sites

50:01.760 --> 50:06.719
have been taken in an operation that
they had absolutely no control over.

50:06.720 --> 50:09.399
This will concentrate
their minds very quickly,

50:09.400 --> 50:11.599
lead to a change of personnel
at the top

50:11.600 --> 50:15.399
and a complete change of direction,
without any blood being spilt,

50:15.400 --> 50:18.879
or the general public being involved
in any way.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.239
I see.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.839
This is where my dear friend
Richard here comes in.

50:22.840 --> 50:26.239
War hero, already immensely popular
with the public.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.119
They will believe
everything he says.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.919
He will lead the new government

50:30.920 --> 50:34.519
and help us reverse the disastrous
direction we've been heading in,

50:34.520 --> 50:37.611
which is deteriorating by the day.

50:39.200 --> 50:41.399
You understand now, Samuel?

50:41.400 --> 50:45.239
He understands, I'm sure.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.600
Yes, I do.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.839
And will it work, this plan?

50:49.840 --> 50:51.879
Yes. I can't see
anything stopping it.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.519
Even with so many people
being involved.

50:54.520 --> 50:58.520
Secrecy has been preserved
surprisingly well.

50:59.400 --> 51:02.519
What time does your new watch
say it is, Samuel?

51:02.520 --> 51:05.239
Er... almost 530.

51:05.240 --> 51:08.513
It's one minute slow,
your new watch.

51:09.400 --> 51:12.319
We're getting very close
to the real business of the day.

51:12.320 --> 51:16.866
I'm going to get another drink now.
Fortify myself.

51:22.640 --> 51:26.277
He's such an extraordinary man,
isn't he?

51:26.480 --> 51:28.399
Such a terrific mind.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.159
He's been like a teacher to me,
really.

51:31.160 --> 51:34.342
In everything, for most of my life.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.735
And he always surprises me.

51:53.120 --> 51:54.720
Hello, Mum.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.840
I said, hello, Mum.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.720
Hello, Anthony.

52:31.480 --> 52:33.390
My darling.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.039
When I decided to go,

52:38.040 --> 52:42.720
I never, ever meant it
to be so long.

52:44.760 --> 52:49.479
I know what I done is wrong,
that I've hurt you horribly.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.239
No, you don't need to say that.

52:51.240 --> 52:53.279
I don't blame you.

52:53.280 --> 52:56.519
I'm not angry. You must blame me!

52:56.520 --> 53:00.975
You must be angry!
You should be so... so furious!

53:04.000 --> 53:05.839
Not any more.

53:05.840 --> 53:09.319
You are back with us,
you are back with me.

53:09.320 --> 53:12.119
And that's all that matters,
my darling boy.

53:12.120 --> 53:17.319
And there's a whole different
person to discover,

53:17.320 --> 53:19.799
because I never knew the old Anthony
well enough, did I?

53:19.800 --> 53:23.073
I never discovered the true Anthony.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.919
But I will now.

53:25.920 --> 53:29.159
When you found me,
it didn't just happen.

53:29.160 --> 53:33.039
When you took me away from
the hotel, it didn't stop.

53:33.040 --> 53:35.079
I couldn't be Anthony...

53:35.080 --> 53:37.439
You don't need to explain.

53:37.440 --> 53:40.079
Not now, maybe not ever.

53:40.080 --> 53:44.559
And as I get to know you,
with your new voice and everything,

53:44.560 --> 53:46.833
you'll find out about me.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.039
I hope so, anyway.

53:49.040 --> 53:53.677
Because I am not going
to be that same person again.

53:54.200 --> 53:56.879
I don't quite know how it will be,

53:56.880 --> 53:59.599
but you'll help me, I'm sure.

53:59.600 --> 54:03.399
I'm never going to hold
another party, for a start.

54:03.400 --> 54:07.582
Not for Arthur, not for Walton,
not for anyone.

54:11.640 --> 54:12.919
And do you know what?

54:12.920 --> 54:16.559
I can't even ring your father,
I can't tell him yet,

54:16.560 --> 54:18.639
because I don't know where he is.

54:18.640 --> 54:22.731
He's at one of his endless
important meetings.

54:25.240 --> 54:27.422
But he'll be back later.

54:28.080 --> 54:30.319
And waiting for him

54:30.320 --> 54:34.139
will be the greatest present
he's ever had.

54:35.440 --> 54:36.959
Good show. Very good show.

54:36.960 --> 54:41.119
I'm still on the fruit juice,
which is lucky.

54:41.120 --> 54:44.359
An awful lot of details
to get across in my speech.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.840
Of course.

55:45.920 --> 55:50.648
I think it's about to start,
isn't it - the speeches?

56:01.480 --> 56:02.920
Mr Petrukhin.

56:04.760 --> 56:09.124
Your bleeper is going to be useful
to us, I hear.

56:09.480 --> 56:12.117
Absolutely, I'm sure it will.

56:31.880 --> 56:33.879
Here's to our plans.

56:33.880 --> 56:38.153
Which we know you will never
tell anybody about.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.920
And here's to you joining us
one day.

56:54.360 --> 56:57.000
Now it's over... isn't it?

57:04.840 --> 57:06.879
How do I look?

57:06.880 --> 57:09.479
You look very good, Mum.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.279
I haven't worn this for so long.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.519
Just because I'm not going to have
any more parties

57:13.520 --> 57:16.679
doesn't mean I can't get dressed up
when there's something to celebrate.

57:16.680 --> 57:19.399
And there's certainly something
to celebrate tonight.

57:19.400 --> 57:24.119
When your father gets home, we're
going to start with a vengeance.

57:24.120 --> 57:27.159
- He'll be home soon, then?
- Yes. Very soon.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.399
And then we're going to have
a feast.

57:29.400 --> 57:31.128
No meat, of course.

57:54.480 --> 57:56.559
Studying the audience, are you?

57:56.560 --> 58:02.197
Some of them are odd bedfellows,
but they can all be relied on.

58:02.360 --> 58:05.879
I just realised, where's Walter?
I didn't see him anywhere.

58:05.880 --> 58:09.519
That's because Walter
was never one of us.

58:09.520 --> 58:13.339
He really did like
his Victorian buildings.

58:16.560 --> 58:19.279
I'm surprisingly nervous, old chap.

58:19.280 --> 58:23.759
Then maybe someone else can do it,
give the details.

58:23.760 --> 58:26.639
There you go again.

58:31.640 --> 58:33.920
Take your seat, Samuel.

58:50.880 --> 58:53.839
So here's my chance
to welcome you all formally.

58:53.840 --> 58:57.279
We all know why we're here, so there's
no need for me to beat about the bush,

58:57.280 --> 59:02.239
except to say that the situation
has become even more urgent,

59:02.240 --> 59:04.679
with these appalling riots
in London.

59:04.680 --> 59:06.590
Riots in our capital!

59:07.880 --> 59:11.119
Because of all the people
we've unwisely let into our country.

59:11.120 --> 59:14.479
Now, I am going to introduce you
to our main speaker,

59:14.480 --> 59:18.359
who will be going over some
of the operational details for you.

59:18.360 --> 59:23.639
I hardly need to remind you that
not a single word you hear tonight

59:23.640 --> 59:26.559
must be breathed outside this room.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.199
It's a great privilege to welcome

59:29.200 --> 59:31.999
somebody I regard as
a very good friend.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.839
One of the most inspirational
figures in the country,

59:34.840 --> 59:37.477
and one of the most charming.

59:37.480 --> 59:38.959
Richard Shaw.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.520
Ahem!

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.439
Thank you, Reginald,
for that fulsome introduction.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.559
Too flattering, as always.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.319
I'm going to get
straight to the point.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.879
Because we all know why
this is a momentous meeting.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.639
Although there is just one thing
I want to say first.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.559
I know none of you will use
this word,

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.279
but let nobody call this treason.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.399
I was a soldier for many years
before I entered Parliament,

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.919
and I can tell you,
this is not treason.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.159
This is our duty.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.479
Hear, hear!

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.519
We have been forced to act
because of the extraordinary

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.439
and incomprehensible decision
of our present government

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.599
to dismantle the British Empire.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.399
We all know that will be a disaster!

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.839
Hear, hear!

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.799
The reduction of these islands
to an unimportant outcrop

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.919
that the rest of the world
will treat with derision.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.679
We will not let that happen!

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.359
And, of course, there's that
second evil we're all aware of.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.599
The influence everywhere
of the Soviet Union.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.319
The Russians have penetrated
deep into our government,

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.230
and, no doubt, into the governments
of our closest allies as well.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.448
Come on! Come on, you're late!

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.119
So... you are all aware, I believe,

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.279
of the most important
strategic sites.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.559
London Airport, Broadcasting House,
the centre of radio,

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:54.288
Fleet Street, and one of our
main military air bases.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.279
Company, halt!

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.639
I'm General Mad Dog Bonkers!

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.039
And I'm going to take over
the world.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.719
The world, sir? The whole world?

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.239
Indeed! Well, making a start
with this country,

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.839
because I've got my own
private army, you see.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.839
Which Major Barney
here has been raising.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.839
I have, sir.
Most definitely, sir.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.879
We've been training in the woods,
haven't we? Training in the woods.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.639
With good old British mud
on our faces.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.479
So everything, of course,
will depend on timing

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.079
and having very good communications
on the day.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.799
Now, we're going to be using
a new paging system

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.839
when we get on to these sites,

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.931
so that our messages to each other
can't be... monitored.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.679
Just one moment, please.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.279
- We have been training.
- Training! Training!

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.039
See, I've got a jolly big house.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.839
And at the bottom of my garden,
there's a jolly big wood.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.799
And in there, I've got a lot of jolly
big tanks and my own private army.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.350
And pretty soon, we're going
to be coming out of the trees.

01:03:02.351 --> 01:03:03.199
Out of the trees!

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.519
And we're going to teach everyone
a lesson, aren't we, Major Barney?

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.839
Yes, we are, sir!

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.679
Suddenly, you'll wake up
and there we'll be!

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.079
Yeah. And then you can rest easy
in your beds, safe and sound,

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.119
because we're going to march down
Whitehall with our great big tanks,

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.319
handing out free bananas,
free bananas,

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.959
for anyone who joins us
and realises we're in charge now.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.599
Free bananas!

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.519
Well, it is a coincidence, isn't it?
It must be.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.975
A total bloody coincidence.

01:03:35.977 --> 01:03:37.021
I'm sure it is.

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:39.119
And you got friends in high places,
don't you, sir?

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.359
I most certainly do.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.759
Yes, Old Mad Dog has got
friends in very high places.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.959
Some of them are even...
lords of the realm!

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.639
And they're going to be helping us
out in all sorts of ways.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.279
Yes, I'm General Mad Dog Bonkers,

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.959
and I'm going to save
the British Empire!

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.959
- Because we're not a tiny island!
- We are not!

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.480
No.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.799
The cat is out of the bag.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.519
Cos we're not tiny!

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.239
Can't let a fucking comedian
stop us, surely?

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.799
Everyone will be shouting,
"We're not tiny",

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.159
out of their first-floor windows.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.879
I think a slight delay
may be necessary.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.439
We're not tiny!

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.359
What's more, now we have
our tanks on the streets,

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.999
those Ruskies are going to have
to take us a lot more seriously, as well.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.819
There's been a leak, obviously.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.839
We should all get out of here.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.879
They'll be quaking in their boots,
sir. Quaking in their snowy boots.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.319
Yes, they're going to be quaking in their
boots because there's Reds everywhere.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.959
Well spotted, Major Barney.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.759
But worry not, Mad Dog and his friends
will have everything under control.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.886
Yes, we'll soon have the
whole country marching in step

01:04:46.887 --> 01:04:48.239
and feeling proud again!

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.519
We're going to put the swagger
back into Blighty.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.839
- Yeah, because we're not tiny!
- We're not tiny!

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.839
No Johnny Foreigner is ever going
to make a laughing stock of us ever again.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.359
And now you are going to tell
the viewing millions how they can join us.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.159
I most certainly am!

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.799
You may write to us at -

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.759
General Mad Dog Bonkers,

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.599
We're Not Tiny,
Bulldog House, Pall Mall, London.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.359
And you have to be at least 10 years
old to join up, don't you, sir?

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.839
You do.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.639
Although, if your father has
a title, you may join at seven.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.731
Because we're not tiny!

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.800
Thank you.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.400
Mr Petrukhin? Just one moment.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.599
Could you come this way, please?

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.079
- What for?
- It will only take a moment.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.535
Why do they want to see me?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.479
You could have asked.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.959
I'm an... I'm an electrics man,
I was keeping a record.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.120
I was keeping a record!

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.648
This is outrageous.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.279
I'm a guest here!

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.640
Hello?

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.011
Get down on your knees.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.851
I bloody well will not.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.626
Doesn't make any difference.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.039
I always thought
you weren't one of us.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.800
Of course I wasn't.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.399
Couldn't let that happen,
could I, Samuel?

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:32.673
Let it be the end of
the Bleeper Man.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.720
He's always liked you.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.319
For several months now,
I've been carrying a gun. I...

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:55.559
didn't think I'd ever
have to use it.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.560
- I ought to thank you.
- No need.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.599
Needless to say, this is not
how I expected the evening to end.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.799
Being disrupted by a comedian,
some would say rather appropriately.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.800
The death of a secret serviceman.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.559
There's usually somebody that
oversteps the mark, isn't there?

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.279
Why is that?

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.011
In the end, you didn't believe
in us, did you?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.158
No.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.720
That is a pity.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.078
I'm sorry to be so obvious, Arthur,

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.353
but are you going to call
the police?

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:43.999
You expect a lot, Samuel.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.273
No, I'm not going to call
the police.

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:54.319
You can, of course, but I will not
be here when they arrive.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.200
I'll disappear for a while.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.222
And I'll be very difficult to find.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.199
So, what's going to happen
at this precise moment? How do I...

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.746
Get away from me?

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.251
Just in the normal way.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.953
We'll order a local taxi.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.382
Move It
by Cliff Richard and The Shadows.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.679
I thought you might want these, sir.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.439
Thank you.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.959
Although you'll probably want
to chuck them out now,

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.779
after what you've been through.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.759
There's been nothing about it
in the papers,

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.719
even though I reported everything
to you and the police.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.199
Well, given the people involved,

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.199
there wouldn't have been,
would there?

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.679
The man who was killed was
a member of the Secret Service,

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.199
so the public will be protected
from all the details.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.879
You were the only witness, Samuel.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.040
So I was.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.359
Will you be able to find
Lord Wallington, do you think?

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.239
No, I very much doubt it.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.719
He'll no longer be in the country.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.279
He'll know how to vanish.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.719
I'm sorry I failed to get
any of the tapes out.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.839
Don't worry.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.719
There will be other opportunities,
almost certainly.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.799
They'll be back,
in some form or other,

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.239
with another wild attempt at a coup.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.679
But we'll be ready for them -

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.079
maybe armed with a comedian
or two this time.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.959
Yes. I never thought ridicule
could be so effective.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:36.324
I don't suppose we'll ever know how
they got a hold of all the details.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.599
Well, they're finally free
of his influence, at least.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.879
- You think it was all due to him?
- Yes.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.839
She's totally innocent, of course.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.295
And as for Richard, it was probably
a bout of summer madness.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.759
So you're still in love
with them, clearly.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.033
Certainly not.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.891
I am free of them, too.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:11.048
I no longer want to be the perfect
English gentleman.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.320
I almost forgot.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.719
Yesterday, I went to the hospital,
on the off chance His Lordship

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.359
might be pulling
the same trick you did.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.519
And what did I see,

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.520
but the staff locator everywhere?

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.284
You see? I did have
a party after all.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.159
Dad?

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.879
This is Joel.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.479
He's a friend of mine.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.026
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Lovely to meet you, too.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.448
That's the first step, anyway.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.199
Another friend of mine, Dad.
Nicholas Harper.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.039
He taught me at etiquette class.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:57.768
Yes, I always wondered
whose class she was really in.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:01.575
And now he writes jokes
for Max Dennis.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.279
Well, you must
tell me all about that.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:08.826
I feel you have rather a lot
to tell me.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.599
You keep looking around.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.719
They're not going to come.
They're not.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.760
They will.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.759
Time to buy your raffle tickets!

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.719
There are many good prizes,
including a camera with a zoom lens

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.559
used by secret agents.

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.159
I won't be claiming it, of course,
since I've been forbidden

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.797
to take part - on account of
the fact that I nearly always win.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.239
My dear old chap,
what a summer we've had, haven't we?

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.786
Kathleen says it's time
for a new start.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.906
Little terrifying at my age.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.706
You haven't heard
from Arthur, have you?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.519
Here's to Mad Dog Bonkers.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.879
Did your father ever tell you
what happened with him

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.799
and generals in the private army?

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.279
No, not yet.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.879
He said it's an official secret.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.159
One of those.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.320
He'll tell me one day, I hope.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.399
Anthony's suddenly come back
and Arthur's suddenly vanished.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.719
Isn't that an odd thing
to have happened?

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.357
Perhaps there's a connection.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.119
In some way?

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.399
Maybe it's good that
Arthur's gone now.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.128
And maybe he'll stay vanished.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.839
I should have known more, Samuel.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.750
I really should have.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.719
Richard seems a little bit lost
without Arthur at the moment.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:36.630
But he'll be OK, I think.
He has to grow up eventually.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.677
But I love him so.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.800
Of course.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.159
But it's so good your children
are back with you, Sam.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.759
And Anthony, of course,
if he goes off somewhere again,

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.039
then that's all right.
Of course it is.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.559
The only thing that matters
is knowing they're safe.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.742
That's absolutely right.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.159
I've just realised.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.719
I've hardly any idea what
my daughter has been up to

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.448
this entire summer.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.379
I just want to propose a toast.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.359
I never make speeches.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:31.239
This is, in fact, my first one ever,
so it'll be only one sentence.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.479
I just want to make a toast
to my daughter, Hannah,

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.599
of course, whose party this is.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.799
And to the rest of my family,
Samuel and Sasha,

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.439
and to the end of the season!

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.719
And, of course, to the
invaluable staff locator too!

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.630
Which is now up and running and
about to take over all your lives!

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.119
Can I just add? Everybody
should notice Hannah's clocks.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.679
Well, you can't really miss them,
can you?

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.479
They're worryingly called
the Doomsday Clock,

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.639
after the nuclear clock
which reminds us just how close

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.559
we are to you-know-what.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.399
The real one is set at
three minutes to midnight.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.959
And these ones are, quite rightly,
set at 8.30.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.159
Let's all drink to that, shall we?

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.519
Hear, hear.
