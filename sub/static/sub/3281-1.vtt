01:05.498 --> 01:07.966
Come on mama, you're too slow.

01:07.968 --> 01:11.637
You're too young,
give me a moment.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.441
My little girl,
so pretty and so big.

01:15.443 --> 01:20.012
Let's go home and I will make you
something delicious. You'll see.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.706
What's happening?
I don't know.

02:27.747 --> 02:31.416
Isabella! Are you ok?
Yes! Yes, but we are very scared.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.584
Get in!

02:50.837 --> 02:51.670
Go left!

02:53.773 --> 02:54.806
Go faster!

02:59.412 --> 03:00.946
We need to go faster!

03:11.925 --> 03:13.992
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

04:03.576 --> 04:06.612
Come on guys keep up.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.914
Nobody mentioned about
3 flights of stairs.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.250
Oh it adds to it's charm honey.

04:11.252 --> 04:15.120
Is this what you call packing light?
Sorry, I forgot what to leave behind.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.623
I mean a whole week in Italy.
Can you imagine.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.158
What did you pack in here?
Books mostly.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.361
You couldn't leave
some of them behind?

04:22.363 --> 04:23.862
Now way! We're gonna
be seeing Pompeii dad.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.697
There's so much to study up on.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.433
The geological composition of the
area, the history of devastation--

04:28.435 --> 04:30.335
Ok! I got it.

04:30.337 --> 04:34.839
Couldn't you just given her a kindle?
You ever thought about raising my allowance?

04:35.342 --> 04:37.510
She's your daughter.

04:38.512 --> 04:41.179
You are too smart for
your own good young lady.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.650
Awesome! There's a loft.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.052
Oh awesome. More charm.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.821
Yeah. More stairs.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.890
Wait a minute.
How many bedrooms is this?

04:51.892 --> 04:54.993
Oh...
Oh no..

04:54.995 --> 04:57.596
It's gonna be fun.
Yeah.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.907
I am so excited how
everything's turning out.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.311
Dad, say hi.
Hi. Hi.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.079
Mom.

05:16.650 --> 05:21.053
Mykaela and I are getting to tag
along on your business trip.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.422
And get a week's
vacation in Italy.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.425
Seeing all the places
she's dreamed about.

05:26.559 --> 05:29.394
You're about to get your dream job.
Oh yeah.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.066
Yeah I know.
It's working out perfectly.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.701
Yeah.

05:35.703 --> 05:39.838
Hey. What is it?
Nothing. I'm just a little jet lagged.

05:43.142 --> 05:45.043
I can read you like a book.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.378
Spill it.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.581
Well this job. It's a big
deal for me... for us.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.584
Yeah. It's a great opportunity.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.588
You're about to run your own
international security company.

05:56.590 --> 06:00.092
And you're going to be great.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.960
Ok listen.

06:04.297 --> 06:08.600
You'll be here for 3 months.
Then you get to come home.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.937
And will never have to
worry about money again.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.941
I'm just worried about this presentation.
It needs more work.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.143
Stop.
Just--

06:18.145 --> 06:20.178
No. You've been working
on it for weeks.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.482
This is what you do.
This is who you are.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.450
It's good. It's really good.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.252
Yeah?
Yeah.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.820
They're gonna love you.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.394
What would I do without you, huh?
Nothing.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.399
Hey kiddo, you're ready?
Yeah.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.200
You bet.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.244
<i>Benvenuto e ben benvenuta.</i>

06:52.246 --> 06:55.180
Ladies and Gentlemen
please form one line.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.816
Sorry I can't go with you guys.

06:57.818 --> 07:01.186
Well we wish you could go too but,
somebody's gotta bring home the bacon.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.454
Come on mom.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.456
Hey hold on. Pompeii
is not going anywhere.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.124
We'll see you tonight?
Yeah.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.659
Good luck.
Thanks baby.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.528
I love you.
I love you too.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.331
Uh princess.
Aren't you forgetting something?

07:13.333 --> 07:16.501
Bye dad.
Good Luck.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.036
Yeah.
See yeah tonight.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.273
Be good.
I will.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.453
Only a small tremor.
It's perfectly normal here in Naple.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.787
All over now. I promise.

07:36.322 --> 07:39.758
Uh, I'm sure it is.
Excuse me a second.

07:40.026 --> 07:44.896
Uh look, you guys don't have to go.
Why don't you just stay around the hotel?

07:44.898 --> 07:47.532
Stay close. See Naple.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.469
You still wanna go baby?

07:50.471 --> 07:53.972
Yeah. I mean how many chances
am I gonna get to see Pompeii?

07:53.974 --> 07:58.677
Right. Ok don't worry.
I'll keep us safe.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.312
Hmm. I sure you will baby.
All right.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.980
All right, Tickets?
Yeah.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.249
You look after your mother.

08:04.383 --> 08:07.552
Yeah dad.
And before I forget...

08:09.088 --> 08:11.690
You might want to take
these just in case.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.593
Sat Phones?
Yeah Sat. phones.

08:14.827 --> 08:18.530
With GPS Tracking.
Satellite phones with GPS tracking?

08:18.532 --> 08:21.433
Really Jeff?
I got clearance on them.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.736
Dad, you do this every time.
You freak out, get over protective

08:24.738 --> 08:26.738
and do your whole soldier thing.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.941
Smart phones can actually loose
battery or you could be in an area--

08:29.943 --> 08:32.376
Dad come on are you serious?
Ok ok ok ok!

08:32.379 --> 08:36.114
We'll take the phones.
At ease soldier.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.116
Come on mom we're
gonna miss the tour.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.186
You...

08:41.587 --> 08:45.557
worry too much.
Easy with that finger.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.458
Ok.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.001
Paul.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.470
Look it's Italy. I was looking
forward to carnet and cappuccino.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.438
We shouldn't have over
slept this morning.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.131
Hey! Glad you could join us.

09:03.157 --> 09:06.403
You're just in time to be herded
aboard the cattle express.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.980
Yeah come in. Ok Welcome.

09:10.082 --> 09:13.118
Be nice. I'm sorry he's grumpy
without his morning coffee.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.954
Oh that's ok. The hearding
is our favorite part.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.422
Moo.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.725
God mom.
I'm Christine. This is Paul.

09:20.727 --> 09:24.529
I am Lynne and this is my
embarrassed daughter Mykaela.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.431
I guess we are all on
the same boat today.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.499
Or bus I suppose.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.301
Yeah, from a dump to a ruin.

09:29.303 --> 09:32.404
Eey!
I think I'm a like this guy.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.975
Oh. Ok.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.845
Come come inside. Ok. Welcome.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.826
Come come.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.562
Welcome, to Pompeii.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.946
Now...

10:14.948 --> 10:17.983
We all know what cause Pompeii
to fall to ruin, yes?

10:17.985 --> 10:19.084
Yes.

10:19.086 --> 10:23.355
The eruption. The Volcano.
And there she is.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.857
Mount vesuvius.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.700
Yes of course.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.536
Mount vesuvius explode and
covered the city in ash.

10:38.538 --> 10:44.009
But can anyone tell me when the volcano
exploded and destroyed our beautiful Pompeii?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.711
Yes miss?
79 A.D.?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.346
<i>Pefecto</i> Miss.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.049
Can you tell us more
about Vesuvius?

10:51.051 --> 10:55.220
Uh ok. It's probably the most
dangerous volcano in the world.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.422
Because 3 million
people live near by,

10:57.424 --> 11:00.025
All though there is some dispute
about the name, it's likely a

11:00.027 --> 11:03.662
hybridized Greek and Latin
word meaning "unquenchable".

11:03.664 --> 11:06.731
<i>Perfecto.</i> feel free to explore.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.669
Mount Vesuvius has erupted
more than 50 times.

11:10.671 --> 11:14.873
The eruption in 79 A.D. was
the most famous, of course.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.609
The dust "Poured across
the land" like a flood,

11:17.611 --> 11:21.413
one witness wrote, and shrounded
the city in " a darkness...

11:21.415 --> 11:24.582
liked the black of closed
and unlighted room.

11:24.584 --> 11:29.354
Two thousand people died, and the city
was abandoned for almost as many years.

11:29.356 --> 11:34.526
It wasn't until 1748 that a group
of explorers rediscovered the site,

11:34.528 --> 11:37.095
surprised to find that
underneath a thick layer of

11:37.097 --> 11:41.766
dust and debris Pompeii
was perfectly intact.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.145
Follow me. Throughfare!

11:55.414 --> 11:56.448
Move!

11:58.818 --> 11:59.984
Watch out!

12:36.489 --> 12:38.690
Hey honey.
Did you feel that?

12:38.692 --> 12:41.426
Yes we felt it.
Everything ok?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.261
Ok?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.864
Some of the ruins collapsed. I think
even some of the people are hurt.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.298
Are you and Mykaela ok?

12:47.300 --> 12:51.302
Yeah we're fine. We're fine.
Mykalea and I are fine.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.005
I don't want you to
worry about that baby.

12:54.007 --> 12:57.008
Look, I'm going to reschedule.
I'm gonna come get you guys.

12:57.010 --> 13:01.346
No honey. Really, we're fine.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.815
We're just shooken up
a bit, that's all.

13:03.817 --> 13:08.720
I'm sure we're gonna be back on the bus
and back in town any minute now, ok?

13:08.854 --> 13:12.557
You sure?
I'm positive.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.794
I do not want you to
miss that meeting baby.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.331
Mykaela wants to talk to you.
We'll see you tonight.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.169
How are you guys? Ok?
Is there any place to get a coffee dude?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.370
Love you.

13:26.238 --> 13:29.140
Hi dad.
Hey princess.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.744
You ok?
Yeah I'm fine.

13:32.746 --> 13:36.447
But?
What is it?

13:38.250 --> 13:43.221
This morning at the news stand I saw that
there had been an eruption in the Galapagos.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.659
They said there's been
seismic activity everywhere.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.627
But then...

13:51.397 --> 13:55.800
I have read so many times that there's
always activity near an active volcano.

13:56.068 --> 13:59.137
What are you saying? Do you think
you and your mom are in danger?

14:01.807 --> 14:07.011
No. No. Everything's fine.
I'm just being paranoid dad.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.747
No no no princess.
That's all right.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.216
Look...

14:11.218 --> 14:13.218
I'll call you when I'm done, ok?

14:13.220 --> 14:16.287
Dad seriously, everything is fine.
Don't panic.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.790
Really, me and mom
have it under control.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.127
Good luck.
Ok thanks. You and mom be safe.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.363
Bye dad.
Bye princess.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.866
And make sure you keep
those sat. phones--

14:29.368 --> 14:32.103
Hello?
Hello?

14:33.205 --> 14:36.140
Everything ok?
Yeah.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.029
Mr. Pierce.
Very pleased to meet you.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.431
I'm Victtore Fabricio, Senior
Vice President of operations.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.166
Please call me Jeff, sir.

15:02.168 --> 15:06.170
Wonderful. Uh this way. Mr. Rosso
and the others are waiting.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.477
Gianni.
Yes.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.312
How do we get out of this place?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.948
We'll try the entrance first.
If that doesn't work we try Porta Sarno.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.816
The gate by the--
By the amphitheater.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.519
Hey, on the other side of the city.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.021
Ok.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.023
Here, this way.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.062
Lynne.

15:31.132 --> 15:34.724
I must confess. I am amazed
at your daughter's knowledge

15:34.750 --> 15:37.302
of the city and our
fearsome volcano.

15:38.004 --> 15:42.807
Yeah she does her best to keep
us amazed. That's for sure.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.611
Tell me, how is it you are
so drawn to volcanoes?

15:46.613 --> 15:50.348
My dad was away a lot when
I was a kid. Marines.

15:50.350 --> 15:54.352
Whenever he went away somewhere I'd read
everything I could about the place he was

15:54.354 --> 16:00.224
stationed. Everything from local customs,
to the way the land was formed.

16:00.392 --> 16:05.730
Knowing about where he was, really
did make me feel closer to him.

16:05.732 --> 16:10.368
The more I read, the more I realized how
much I loved learning about the earth.

16:10.502 --> 16:14.339
While other girls were playing with
dolls, I was playing with rocks.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.843
There is much to study in Italy.
Perhaps one day you can come

16:18.845 --> 16:21.713
live with us when you
are a famous geologist.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.115
I would die to live in Italy.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.190
That's another small one right?
Perhaps we should...

16:38.530 --> 16:39.998
Go! Quickly.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.514
RUN!

17:01.220 --> 17:05.356
I of course could Implement it and
have it up and running in 3 months.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.759
Seems like a plan.
Ok

17:21.707 --> 17:24.008
Mio dio!
Vesuvius.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.756
Do you have a helicopter?
Excuse me?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.158
Does this company
have a helicopter?

17:40.160 --> 17:43.895
Mr. Pierce.
I need to use it.

17:45.631 --> 17:48.232
Mr. Rosso my family is in Pompeii.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.968
I'm sorry but I cannot.
Not for this.

17:51.170 --> 17:54.505
If you try to fight Vesuvius
you will die. I promise you.

17:55.007 --> 17:59.210
Jeff, please you have to listen to Mr. Rosso.
You cannot go to Pompeii.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.732
Mykaela?
Mom?

18:22.501 --> 18:23.935
That's bad.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.319
Honey, you there?

18:41.321 --> 18:45.323
Jeff. We're ok but the volcano has--

18:45.325 --> 18:48.826
I know. You gotta find shelter.
Somewhere sturdy with cover.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.362
Find it. I'll be there soon.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.898
Are you guys alright?
Is everything ok?

18:53.900 --> 18:57.401
I don't think you should.
No. Stay there. I'm coming for you.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.637
I love you Jeff but--

19:01.040 --> 19:03.674
Lynne.
Jeff?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.176
Lynne!

19:05.178 --> 19:07.912
Jeff?
Dammit!

19:08.547 --> 19:11.149
Stay away Jeff.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.649
Come on. come on.
Move move move. Thank you.

19:58.597 --> 19:59.864
Excuse me sir?

20:03.069 --> 20:07.638
No I have to get through here.
Get back. No one gets through.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.576
My wife and daughter are in Pompeii.
I have to get through.

20:11.578 --> 20:14.545
Pompeii?
Pompeii is ground zero.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.648
No one is going there.
Get back in your car.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.818
No you don't understand,
I have to get there.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.955
Back in car now.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.623
Easy buddy.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.528
Back in car or I arrest you.
Go.

20:36.768 --> 20:39.036
You play nintendo.

21:11.204 --> 21:13.771
Hello Carlo,
Yeah I'll be right there.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.874
Dammit! Come on!
Ok Yeah.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.191
Carlo.

21:34.193 --> 21:37.028
God no one's called me
that in a few years.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.463
My dear friend it's good to see you.
You too.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.732
Despite the circumstances.
Tell me something good.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.604
As soon as I got your call,
I sent out a

21:43.630 --> 21:45.703
request to the top of
the Italian Government.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.339
There's no go I'm afraid.
This is a--

21:48.341 --> 21:51.175
Pompeii is strictly off limits.
The whole area is off limits.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.377
We are on stand by
to evacuate Naples.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.251
No no no no, you don't
understand this is my

21:55.277 --> 21:57.081
wife and daughter we're
talking about here.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.183
You think I don't understand that?
You think I don't remember that debt

21:59.185 --> 22:03.454
I owe you from Canada. I tell you
this is a major international crisis.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.222
I would help you if
there was anyway--

22:05.224 --> 22:07.992
There is a way. there's always a way.
You know that. You're special ops.

22:07.994 --> 22:12.663
I was special ops in the days when
I was Carlo. Now I'm Colonel Dylard.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.899
Nato liaison. I'm a pen pusher.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.834
You're the same guys.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.070
Come on Carlo. Come on man.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.442
There's also something
else you don't know...

22:25.344 --> 22:26.410
How bad?

22:27.813 --> 22:31.182
I just spoke to the head of
science at Sapienza di Roma.

22:31.184 --> 22:35.619
Pompeii will be under sixty
feet of lava within four hours.

22:37.889 --> 22:38.989
Sorry.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.393
Come on. Get in.
Where am I going?

22:44.196 --> 22:45.663
Where are you going?

22:47.332 --> 22:51.435
There's nothing we can do. You
can't stop the bloody volcano man.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.166
Come on.

23:34.479 --> 23:35.346
Get down!

24:20.358 --> 24:22.359
Don't touch it! Go!

24:23.094 --> 24:24.094
Here!

24:27.966 --> 24:28.866
Come on!

24:31.002 --> 24:33.604
Is that safe?
It's safer then out here.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.774
Go!

25:27.058 --> 25:28.225
Over there.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.303
That's it.
You're gonna be alright.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.340
Mom.

25:45.443 --> 25:46.844
I'll be fine.

25:56.455 --> 25:58.088
It looks really bad.

25:59.891 --> 26:00.925
Oh my god.

26:03.795 --> 26:07.798
You realize these guys will give you the
same answer as the Italian Government?

26:08.099 --> 26:09.300
Still gotta try.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.537
Right. But if you get the answer that
I think they're going to give you,

26:13.539 --> 26:16.473
I'll wait outside for you.
And meet you in an hour.

26:16.475 --> 26:17.641
Ok.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.879
What are you planning?

26:21.881 --> 26:25.883
Plan B. Just in case your
plan A doesn't plan out.

26:25.885 --> 26:29.320
I'm not the only person in
Italy that owes you a favor.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.690
Good luck old boy.
Thanks.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.163
Right.

26:40.632 --> 26:45.002
Next time I say "Let's go get coffee".
Let's go get coffee.

26:45.004 --> 26:48.138
Here let me help you.
Thank you.

26:53.278 --> 26:57.281
Hey. Here.
You saved my life out there.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.584
We were just in the neighborhood.
Thanks.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.188
I'm Naveen. And that's Rashida.

27:04.422 --> 27:07.524
I'm Lynne.
Mykaela.

27:24.542 --> 27:27.878
Thank you.
It's a hell of a day huh?

27:28.179 --> 27:29.213
Tell me about it.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.316
This morning Naveen said that
he felt something important

27:32.318 --> 27:35.786
was gonna happen to us today.
Me and my big mouth huh?

27:36.354 --> 27:38.555
Hey.
There ya go.

27:39.891 --> 27:40.791
Thanks man.

27:44.529 --> 27:47.398
Next time I won't visit
a natural disaster.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.367
If there's even a next time.

27:50.568 --> 27:51.702
Paul!

27:53.304 --> 27:55.939
I can't be the only
one thinking that.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.275
Hey.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.078
You ok?

28:01.080 --> 28:04.214
Yeah.
I guess.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.885
It was really lucky that
you found this place, ok?

28:07.887 --> 28:09.987
It's exactly what your
dad said to find.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.257
You did really good.
You did really good baby.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.259
In theory we should be ok here.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.528
It withstood the last
eruption after all.

28:17.530 --> 28:20.497
Unless it's worse this time.
Worse?

28:20.499 --> 28:22.666
Can it really get any worse?

28:26.906 --> 28:29.339
Mr. Pierce please believe me.
We'd like nothing better then to

28:29.341 --> 28:31.075
assist you in locating your
wife and your daughter.

28:31.077 --> 28:34.011
All I'm asking for
is transport sir.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.447
Believe me Captain,
I don't doubt your ability

28:36.449 --> 28:39.717
but as I said, it's not that easy.
It is. That easy.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.919
It is not that easy. You heard
what your friend said CO said.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.354
Word from the Italian government,
is that everybody is coming out.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.457
Nobody is going in. Certainly
no civilians. God only knows

28:46.459 --> 28:48.392
how they feel about some
black ops commando--

28:48.394 --> 28:51.028
Exactly. I'm black ops. I can
make this a cougar operation.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.530
Sir please, believe me we're
trying to keep you safe.

28:53.532 --> 28:57.468
This is my wife and daughter.
Mr. Pierce I get it.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.036
We're talking about a
volcanic eruption.

28:59.038 --> 29:02.606
I've done it before. Many times.
That's my job!

29:02.608 --> 29:07.544
Look I want to help you. Really I do.
Neither you or I can stop a volcano.

29:07.779 --> 29:09.780
<i>We are now receiving
reports from Niihau Hawaii,</i>

29:09.782 --> 29:12.549
<i>where a ring of volcanoes
have risen from the ocean,</i>

29:12.551 --> 29:15.319
<i>endangering air traffic
and local population...</i>

29:15.321 --> 29:17.654
In a little over 3 hour
Pompeii will be gone.

29:17.989 --> 29:21.225
Right now the only thing I can
do is try and keep you safe.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.127
That's it. I'm sorry.

29:23.261 --> 29:27.765
That's what we're dealing with.
So you are not gonna help me.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.534
No Mr. Pierce I can't.

29:32.270 --> 29:36.707
We're heading out of Naples in an hour.
I f you're you'll be coming with us.

29:36.841 --> 29:39.009
If not...

29:39.944 --> 29:41.512
God help you man.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.763
You guys have everything in those packs.
Our whole lives are in there.

30:01.232 --> 30:04.067
We've been backpacking through
Europe for the past 3 months.

30:07.338 --> 30:10.340
Naveen is hard to persuade when
he gets an idea in his head.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.243
Like you were
putting up a fight.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.779
Are you two married?

30:17.182 --> 30:19.850
Uh, not quite yet. No.

30:19.852 --> 30:20.918
It's complicated.

30:26.457 --> 30:29.193
Are you getting a signal with that?
No.

30:30.962 --> 30:34.042
Then you might want to conserve your
battery when we get signal at some point.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.705
Really?
What's your deal dude?

30:41.707 --> 30:44.830
Oh sorry. I work for a
travel blog back home.

30:44.856 --> 30:47.477
Just fly around the world,
take photos

30:47.479 --> 30:53.584
of tourist traps.
My first trip to Italy. It's exciting.

30:56.387 --> 30:58.755
Hey...

30:58.757 --> 31:00.657
Did you hear that?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.629
What?
I don't hear anything?

31:06.497 --> 31:07.598
I think it stopped.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.434
I don't think so.

31:12.904 --> 31:13.804
Well?

31:15.106 --> 31:18.075
Looks like I'm on my own.
Oh no you're not.

31:26.517 --> 31:30.354
You work fast.
Good guys have friends.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.690
We are not much.

31:34.859 --> 31:36.627
You're all the paper
pushers you could dig up.

31:36.629 --> 31:38.595
Yeah the best I could
do at short notice.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.765
Good to see you soldier.
Captain Pierce.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.903
Look what the cat dragged in.
Always looking for work.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.405
I'm glad I'm not doing
this on my own. Cane.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.567
Never leave you hanging boss.

31:49.583 --> 31:51.975
The old band's officially back
together for one night only.

31:51.977 --> 31:54.144
We hear you got a problem?

31:54.812 --> 31:57.114
Yeah. The size of a mountain.
Your family?

31:58.383 --> 31:59.883
They're at ground zero.
We're getting them out.

32:00.051 --> 32:01.818
Come on. Let's go.

32:04.389 --> 32:05.889
I can't thank you enough.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.058
It was the least I could do.
There is much I still owe you.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.294
Thank. Oh um,

32:10.428 --> 32:12.462
There is one thing. Anything.
Anything at all.

32:12.464 --> 32:15.766
Could you get me a chopper?
Military grade?

32:15.768 --> 32:20.337
Are you out of your mind? I'm Nato
liaison. This isn't even my country.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.239
I will get me court Martial.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.975
Alright alright. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

32:25.176 --> 32:28.378
I'll figure it out.
Yes, I'm sure you will.

32:28.746 --> 32:29.762
Good luck.

32:30.988 --> 32:32.107
Good luck.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.229
Dinner when you come home.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.300
If you come home.

32:38.426 --> 32:40.223
We got gear?
Locked and loaded. The whole kit,

32:40.225 --> 32:42.793
but lacking the caboodle. We're gonna
need some kind of a conveyance.

32:42.795 --> 32:45.295
Yeah. We're gonna get a chopper.
We need something large enough

32:45.297 --> 32:49.222
to hold cargo for transport and extraction,
plus we need to land on a dime.

32:49.248 --> 32:53.070
Basically means we need something fast
and agile to ge us out of trouble.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.891
It's gonna be a war
zone out there.

32:54.917 --> 32:56.732
I could call us a favor
to the British Army.

32:56.841 --> 33:00.777
No, we don't have time. Ah! Damn!
Back it up. Back it up!

33:00.779 --> 33:03.447
So we need to secure a chopper
here in Naples, and fast.

33:03.449 --> 33:04.781
Yep.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.149
I'm guessing, civilian option
is out of the question.

33:06.151 --> 33:09.052
Any ideas?
Yeah.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.888
I know that look.
What are you planning?

33:11.890 --> 33:13.890
Something Carlo is not gonna like.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.334
If there are many
more of that size,

33:40.360 --> 33:42.444
I don't know whether this
villa is gonna hold.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.559
Ok were else can we go Mykaela?

33:49.561 --> 33:52.996
Sweetie you have been reading books about
volcanoes as long as I can remember.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.998
Can you think of some place else?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.535
So place that's safer?
Crap. Wait.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.504
Christine, do you still
have that map of Pompeii?

34:00.506 --> 34:02.339
Yes. Yes I do.

34:07.111 --> 34:09.746
Right. So...

34:12.449 --> 34:13.949
We are here.

34:13.952 --> 34:16.253
We need to get to here.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.288
We should get ready
to move like now!

34:18.290 --> 34:20.456
We need to get there
before what happens next.

34:20.458 --> 34:24.127
Why? What happens next?
You don't want to know.

34:24.129 --> 34:28.065
Tell us.
The heat surge.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.367
How much heat are we talking?

34:30.369 --> 34:31.935
Enough.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.877
Everybody go! Now!

34:41.446 --> 34:44.347
Mom! Run!

34:46.650 --> 34:48.251
Here.
What's that?

34:48.253 --> 34:52.121
Just take it.
Come on. Go. Go Go.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.771
Paul!

35:27.291 --> 35:30.460
Where are we headed?
The only place that has the ride me need.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.630
JFC Naples?
Isn't that a NATO base?

35:33.632 --> 35:36.800
Yeah it's an Italian Post.
It's the hard way.

35:36.802 --> 35:40.403
As usual.
Just the way I like it.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.075
Oh come on.
Take a right here.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.153
Come on!

35:49.779 --> 35:51.182
How much time do we have?

35:51.284 --> 35:53.850
According to Carlo, only a
couple of hours. Hold on hold on.

35:54.886 --> 35:55.852
Let's have a look.

35:58.122 --> 35:59.923
Let's help him with that car.
Come on.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.694
Jeff stop.
You hear that?

36:05.963 --> 36:07.864
Looks like we should have
actually stayed home.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.136
We need to move.
Incoming!

36:25.984 --> 36:28.251
Move! Move! Move! Move!

37:07.592 --> 37:10.827
Ok.
So the rocks have stopped.

37:11.862 --> 37:12.829
That's good right?

37:14.298 --> 37:15.398
It's good if you don't want to
be hit by flaming rocks but,

37:15.400 --> 37:18.635
It's not good if you don't like heat.
We need to keep moving.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.537
How much further?
Not far.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.551
The roof is intact.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.854
Come on. Everyone inside.

38:01.078 --> 38:02.078
Whoa.

38:02.513 --> 38:06.750
This looks like a death trap to me.
We can see the entrance from here.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.086
Why can't we just keep going?
We don't have time.

38:11.522 --> 38:13.089
When the heat surge hits, there
is no way we could out run it.

38:13.357 --> 38:17.460
What? Are we just suppose to believe you?
You will do well to listen to her.

38:17.462 --> 38:21.498
Alright. Listen to the girl that almost
got us killed inside a collapsing ruin.

38:21.500 --> 38:25.368
There's nothing falling from the sky?
This is our chance to get out of here.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.671
Please come with us.

38:31.108 --> 38:34.277
Wait guys, seriously.
Please. Come on.

38:41.052 --> 38:45.422
I mean, they're kinda right.
It's really small in here.

38:51.195 --> 38:53.430
Good?
Yeah.

38:53.964 --> 38:57.200
Better then I expected.
We need to shut this door.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.271
It will help to block the
heat wave, when it hits.

39:01.505 --> 39:05.375
Ok Mykaela, are you sure
that this is alright?

39:05.910 --> 39:08.478
In 1902 a volcano
erupted on martinique.

39:08.813 --> 39:11.948
There was only one survivor...
a man in a jail cell.

39:13.718 --> 39:17.120
Everybody unpack or take off
the close you don't need.

39:17.321 --> 39:20.457
I need your water too.
Sure.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.760
Thanks. Thanks mom.

39:24.161 --> 39:26.129
Here.
Thanks.

39:27.565 --> 39:30.300
Wait. What are you doing with the water?
We may need this.

39:30.434 --> 39:32.902
I need to soak the clothes to
plug the cracks on the door.

39:33.337 --> 39:35.739
That's what the survivor or
Martinique did to stay alive.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.975
Except he had to
use his own urine.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.177
Hmm.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.316
Thanks.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.364
What do you think cap.?

40:01.366 --> 40:05.602
We're not gonna catch them with
their pants down. But there are gaps.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.570
What do you think?
Destruction or evasion?

40:07.572 --> 40:10.373
A little of both.
So give us the run down.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.142
Targets one o'clock.

40:12.376 --> 40:16.212
Those choppers are exactly what we need.
They're gunships not rescue vehicles.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.782
They won't be used for any
civilian rescue operation.

40:18.784 --> 40:22.018
We're not hurting the rescue effort.
Right.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.621
We're just adding some fire power. Once
we get into the air and over Pompeii,

40:24.623 --> 40:28.091
It'll be just like being back in the
sand box... only a little worse.

40:28.093 --> 40:31.594
Exactly. It's why we have
to be in the offensive.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.464
How do we get in?
We find a whole in the perimeter.

40:34.466 --> 40:37.267
Then we stealth in, but we'll need
a distraction on the outside.

40:37.269 --> 40:40.637
I'll cover that part.
Saved me from asking.

40:40.639 --> 40:44.459
You know me, I just like blowing things up.
Game on. When do we move?

40:44.485 --> 40:48.979
How about now? Time's a ticking.
And uh, minimal force.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.747
Keep your heads down.

41:00.024 --> 41:01.958
<i>This is why I listen to you.</i>

41:01.960 --> 41:06.796
<i>I expect that to be tattooed on
your forehead when we get home.</i>

41:18.175 --> 41:21.778
This is it.
The surge.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.419
Mykaela.
Yeah mom.

41:31.622 --> 41:37.527
I am so proud of you. baby.

41:37.728 --> 41:38.828
Mom.

41:38.830 --> 41:42.699
You are the best... best child

41:42.701 --> 41:44.968
anyone could have ever asked for.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.106
I love you so much.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.813
I'm sorry Rashida.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.450
It's not your fault.

42:01.218 --> 42:05.455
Look, if we make it out
of this, I promise...

42:07.591 --> 42:08.591
I know.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.277
Oh my god.

43:04.449 --> 43:07.350
Oh my god.
We made it.

43:09.086 --> 43:10.286
That was it?

43:13.592 --> 43:14.657
I mean...

43:16.261 --> 43:20.229
This doesn't seem real.
None of this makes any sense.

43:28.839 --> 43:30.373
It's over now, right?

43:31.609 --> 43:33.876
We can rest up here
for a few minutes.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.047
That's the worst of it, right?

43:41.118 --> 43:42.151
Come on!

43:52.596 --> 43:54.163
This is far from over.

44:12.016 --> 44:14.684
I feel naked doing this
in broad daylight.

44:14.818 --> 44:17.153
You're loosing your
nerve hurricane?

44:17.155 --> 44:18.688
Hell no.

44:25.863 --> 44:28.798
Sorry Carlo. Do it.

44:56.727 --> 44:59.395
I know, he's late.
Any minute now.

45:00.764 --> 45:02.165
It should be about time now.

45:06.104 --> 45:08.004
That our cue. Come on.

45:37.935 --> 45:40.803
Come on baby.
Start off for me.

45:51.783 --> 45:54.617
We gotta go!
I know I know, I'm on it.

46:00.924 --> 46:01.724
Hold on.

46:08.298 --> 46:09.499
Alright here we go.

46:35.092 --> 46:36.159
Oh my god.

46:40.931 --> 46:45.001
So. Tell us who's
the volcano expert.

46:45.769 --> 46:47.236
Who we gonna die next.

46:48.839 --> 46:51.439
Our main concern is the sulfuric gas.
For the time being at least.

46:51.775 --> 46:56.479
Deadly in high doses, we'd have to be near
a lot of ash to pose an immediate threat.

46:56.481 --> 46:58.581
How much ash?

46:58.715 --> 47:01.751
A lot of ash, like 10 feet of more.

47:04.288 --> 47:05.521
We have to go now.

47:09.293 --> 47:10.026
Hey.

47:12.629 --> 47:14.389
What is it? I could tell
it's something else?

47:14.498 --> 47:18.601
Nothing anyone else
has to worry about.

47:19.136 --> 47:25.541
Mykalea if there is more danger I think
we all need to know about it ok?

47:25.909 --> 47:29.135
It's just if Vesuvius
decides to erupt again,

47:29.161 --> 47:32.106
it's gonna get worse
with every eruption.

47:32.249 --> 47:36.452
How much worse?
Ever heard of crackatoa?

47:54.872 --> 47:55.972
Alright, where is he?

48:00.277 --> 48:00.977
There.

48:04.381 --> 48:05.281
Let's pick him up.

48:07.885 --> 48:08.751
Alita, open up.

48:11.855 --> 48:14.757
Come on. Come on.
Come on cowboy.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.461
Hey hey hey hey.

48:21.932 --> 48:24.200
You ok soldier?
Thanks.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.469
Are come on. Hold on hold on.

48:28.906 --> 48:29.538
We're off.

48:30.807 --> 48:33.943
This is more fun the taking
kabul from the taliban.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.616
He's gonna bleed out.

48:44.454 --> 48:45.354
You alright cane?

48:50.328 --> 48:51.227
Thanks Cade.

48:52.262 --> 48:55.423
Just don't pass out till we get there.
Actually don't pass out till we get back.

48:58.001 --> 49:02.605
That's why you call me hurricane.
Cause I'm unstoppable baby.

49:02.607 --> 49:06.142
No they call you hurricane
because you are full of hot air.

49:06.977 --> 49:10.813
Alright guys come on. Let's focus.
Cane, I need you up here.

49:13.084 --> 49:14.150
Come on.

49:23.293 --> 49:26.028
Alita you're on coms.
Copy that.

49:26.830 --> 49:28.130
You good?

49:28.132 --> 49:30.232
Five by five. Good ahead
and had her to me captain.

49:32.035 --> 49:33.903
She's all yours.
I've got it.

49:35.172 --> 49:38.908
What's our ETA?
We should be there in 35 minutes.

49:39.810 --> 49:43.412
Keep her floored.

49:53.023 --> 49:56.425
Well I'll be dammed.
Well alright.

49:56.793 --> 49:57.693
Come on everybody.

50:01.531 --> 50:04.467
Having any luck?
You never know.

50:05.502 --> 50:08.738
Mom, the sat phones.
Yeah, well...

50:08.740 --> 50:13.275
I think I lost mine back at the Villa.
It's ok, I still go...

50:14.644 --> 50:17.113
Must have fall out when I fell.

50:19.816 --> 50:21.650
Well we're quite a
pair, aren't we?

50:22.853 --> 50:24.620
What do you think?

50:26.056 --> 50:29.525
I don't know.
Seems right.

50:29.527 --> 50:32.528
I think we should go in.

50:32.530 --> 50:35.097
Are you ok?
Yeah yeah I'm fine. Don't worry.

50:35.099 --> 50:37.833
Are you sure?
It's ok.

50:37.835 --> 50:38.734
Come on.

50:44.442 --> 50:46.308
What now?

50:48.845 --> 50:49.979
Mud slide!

50:50.113 --> 50:52.648
Go go go!

50:55.419 --> 50:58.421
Just go!
Come on!

50:58.889 --> 51:00.589
Just go! Go!

51:43.967 --> 51:44.834
I'm sorry.

51:56.079 --> 51:57.179
I'm so sorry.

52:12.996 --> 52:14.697
The mud slide brought
in a lot of ash.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.902
That means there's gonna be a--
What?

52:20.937 --> 52:23.038
Volcanic ash that you were
talking about earlier?

52:24.841 --> 52:28.110
And there's a lot of dirt
in there too, right?

52:28.112 --> 52:30.846
Maybe there isn't enough
ash to make it a problem?

52:30.848 --> 52:33.249
Like... like you were saying.

52:33.383 --> 52:36.452
Maybe.
I'm no expert.

52:36.887 --> 52:40.389
I could get us all killed.
No.

52:40.391 --> 52:44.493
Dude, we'd be dead already
if it wasn't for you.

52:45.729 --> 52:48.898
None of us know jack
about volcanoes.

52:49.566 --> 52:51.367
We're following you.

52:52.869 --> 52:56.205
It's gonna be ok.
Ok.

53:00.043 --> 53:03.812
So...
What's our next move boss?

53:07.417 --> 53:08.651
I'm not sure.

53:17.495 --> 53:19.995
Dammit.
Nothing.

53:24.768 --> 53:27.469
Um...
Hey guys.

53:29.005 --> 53:30.773
We've got company.

53:33.977 --> 53:36.412
How the hell are they gaining on us.
They're all the same helicopter, right?

53:36.414 --> 53:38.180
What's our speed?

53:38.182 --> 53:39.949
I'm cracking and banking. I don't
know what the hell is going on.

53:39.951 --> 53:41.417
Maybe they have jettisoned ballast.
Or maybe they're more outfitted

53:41.419 --> 53:43.652
for attack instead of transport.

53:44.020 --> 53:48.424
Or maybe we stole the slowest god
damn helicopter in the Italian army.

53:54.931 --> 53:56.365
Cade! Secure that door.

53:58.935 --> 54:02.204
What? I was just gonna take a few shots.
Get them off our back.

54:02.206 --> 54:06.141
A lot can happen with a grenade launcher.
I'm not killing innocent soldiers.

54:07.611 --> 54:15.584
Please be advised we have instructions
to return you to base at once.

54:15.586 --> 54:20.889
Please be advised that we are under
orders shoot if you will not comply.

54:21.291 --> 54:22.685
Do you understand?

54:22.811 --> 54:29.065
We will shoot you out of the
sky, unless you turn around now.

54:29.367 --> 54:33.469
Jeff, please don't do this. Return
to base with us immediately.

54:34.137 --> 54:36.071
I'm sorry Carlo I have too.

54:40.176 --> 54:43.479
Sir, we are almost within
firing distance, sir.

54:43.481 --> 54:46.482
Fire a couple warning shots.
Fire now.

54:46.916 --> 54:48.284
Cane, how far are we?

54:48.286 --> 54:49.985
I could get us to that
cloud with in 3 minutes.

54:49.987 --> 54:52.288
But they are gonna be
within firing range in 1.

54:54.859 --> 54:56.625
I think they're in
firing range now.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.827
Yeah.
Crap.

55:00.096 --> 55:01.697
When I said warning shots
I didn't mean hit him!

55:01.699 --> 55:03.666
Do you understand?
Yes sir.

55:03.668 --> 55:04.600
Right!

55:04.602 --> 55:07.503
Will not happen again sir.
It will not happen again sir.

55:07.505 --> 55:10.472
Other wise they can
get court martialed.

55:10.474 --> 55:14.276
Should I pursue though sir?
Pursue pursue.

55:14.278 --> 55:16.011
You are instructed to pursue.

55:18.048 --> 55:21.617
You use every trick you got. But you
get us into that cloud, got it?

55:21.619 --> 55:24.186
You guys might wanna
buckle up for this part.

55:42.372 --> 55:45.407
Good job. 2 left.
Almost within firing range sir.

55:45.409 --> 55:48.977
Wait wait wait wait. Thinks about this.
If you fire

55:48.979 --> 55:53.382
now, any shots that you miss
could hit the civilian population

55:53.384 --> 55:57.586
trying to leave a volcanic
eruption down below.

55:57.588 --> 56:01.156
My advise would be close up.
Yes sir.

56:01.424 --> 56:04.460
I got this. Crap.

56:06.162 --> 56:10.933
No no no no, when I say pull up,
I don't mean fly up his ass.

56:25.582 --> 56:29.084
Ok. Let's see who's got
the biggest cojones.

56:31.254 --> 56:33.756
Cane!
You really have to do this?

56:33.758 --> 56:35.357
Yeah he does.

56:45.034 --> 56:48.804
If he jigs left, let him go.
Too many civilians are out there.

56:48.806 --> 56:50.539
If he jigs right,
you could shoot.

56:50.541 --> 56:54.042
Uh sir, the microphone is on sir.
Mic was--

56:54.044 --> 56:55.644
Yeah.

56:55.779 --> 56:57.946
My apologies.
Hey it happens sir.

56:59.315 --> 57:02.117
2 to 3 hotel, be advised we
have a firing solution on you.

57:02.119 --> 57:04.820
They got a lock.
Oh no they don't.

57:05.288 --> 57:06.755
1-0-6

57:06.757 --> 57:08.657
Did you see that? Did you see that...
Yes sir.

57:08.659 --> 57:12.594
That's a commuter aircraft.
That is a civilian in the area.

57:12.596 --> 57:14.763
Whatever you do, abort abort abort.

57:14.765 --> 57:18.233
Aborting sir. Aborting
1-0-6 returning.

57:18.235 --> 57:20.569
Alright.
Take us there.

57:23.072 --> 57:24.072
We've got company.

57:56.606 --> 57:58.040
How's your ankle?

58:02.645 --> 58:03.612
It will be alright.

59:53.289 --> 59:56.458
This reminds me of the night raids
on Baghdad during the Gulf War.

59:57.226 --> 59:58.961
Only this is much worse.

59:59.495 --> 01:00:02.331
That's weird.
This reminds me of hell.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.001
We should be over Pompeii in 15.

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:09.404
Uh so when we get there, how the
hell are we gonna find them?

01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:12.307
They are not likely to
be out in the open.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:15.677
And ruins. There is a lot of ground
to cover in the little time we have.

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:19.081
Before Mykaela and Lynne left I made
them take Sat. phones with them.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.850
So we can just call.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.353
No good. have been trying
since we left Naples.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:29.257
All the phones have GPS tracking.
They tether to one another.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.327
Provided that they
are all functional.

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:42.971
Bingo.
One of them is still up.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.172
The coordinates.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.891
Mykaela.
Are you down here?

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:15.704
Hey mom.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:19.741
You ok?

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:26.415
Yeah. I just got a
bit of a headache.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.456
There.
The Pompeii Museum.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:35.791
Good.

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:40.762
Cane. When we get to Pompeii look for
a free standing 4 story building.

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:43.432
It shouldn't be too hard to find.
Roger that.

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:46.468
We have 45 minutes
left for extraction.

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.471
Don't worry Cap.
We'll find them.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.449
Where's Christine?

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.363
Christine!

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:25.607
Christine!

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.347
Mykaela.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:37.619
We have to go!

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:42.324
Everyone! We have to go! Now!

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.361
Mom

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.464
Mom

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:51.566
Breathe. Kai Help me.
Come on.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.636
Where's Christine?
Follow me.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.373
This way!

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:10.585
Quick!

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:16.258
Does anyone have any clothes that I
can use. I need clothes and water!

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.281
Help me tear this
cloth into strips.

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:43.685
Keep the baking soda over your
mouth and breath through that, ok?

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:45.921
It should absorb that gas
which is in the air.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:49.724
In theory.

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:10.512
What the hell was that?

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.554
Mom it's your phone!
This is yours?

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:23.024
I thought it was one of those electronic
tour guide things or something--

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:26.595
I think dad's been trying to track us.
Come on. We need to get to higher ground.

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:49.951
Sir.

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:55.190
What is it? Do you still have contact?
Negative. The connection is gone.

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:56.091
Damn.

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.661
Doesn't change anything.
We still start at the museum.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:01.463
Same plan. Eye on the prize.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.011
Jesus.

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.892
You guys get strapped in. We're
gonna be coming in really hot.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.990
Double time. Come on.
Come on!

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:38.633
This thing is solid.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:53.848
At least it's keeping
the gas out.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:17.205
Another earthquake?
Not this time.

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:25.513
You don't happen to have any
dynamite in that bag, do you?

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.649
Not even a firecracker.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.852
Ok, well we've gotta
do something.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.589
Dad was certainly searching us on the
sat phone before it got smashed.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:37.158
It had to be him.
He knows where we are.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:38.994
Do you think that the
signal went through?

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:40.161
It's possible.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:42.530
If there's a way,
Jeff will find it.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:46.868
And the way you keep talking
about this dude, makes him sound

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:49.304
like some sort of super
hero or something.

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:51.940
Yeah well, he kinda is.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:56.911
Hey I'm the first to get in line
to get rescued by super dad.

01:06:57.046 --> 01:07:00.448
He'll be here. I know it.
It's too dangerous.

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.952
She's right. There's the slightest chance
in hell that he can get to us, he will.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:09.791
That's what he did for a
living for god sakes.

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:13.361
How we doing Cane?
Touchdown 90 seconds boss.

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.931
Alright.
Let's do this.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:28.410
Look, even if he is coming the bad news
is that we can't stay here much longer.

01:07:28.412 --> 01:07:31.012
That second eruption a few
minutes ago, that means that

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:35.383
there is a chance of a pyroclastic flow.
A what?

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:40.021
When a volcano erupts, it can heat up
a rock so hot that it turns into gas.

01:07:40.023 --> 01:07:42.557
That creates a flow that washes
over the ground kind of like

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:46.895
Like a tidal wave.
It's probably dangerous, right?

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:51.766
According to the books,
it can travel 450 miles per hour.

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:56.638
And reach temperature of 4,000
degrees Celsius so, kinda.

01:07:58.007 --> 01:08:00.341
Still no contact?
No.

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:02.177
Alright, we gotta assume they
are still at the museum.

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:05.547
We have less then 30 minutes to get in
there, find them, and get the hell out.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.615
I want it done in 10.
Copy?

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.084
Yeah.
Copy.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:12.687
Alright. Visibility is less them
zero, so I need the flashlights.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.984
You better hit the ground running.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.627
Cane, do you have enough
room to land on the roof?

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.430
The structure seems sound enough
but I'm not risking a touchdown.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.265
I'm gonna keep it right above and
keep the engine running for ya.

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.135
Alright copy. Let's go.

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:35.977
10 minutes.We search every inch
and then we're gone, copy?

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:37.412
Copy.
Copy.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.680
Alright. Let's go.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.966
It's dad.
It's gotta be!

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.466
It has to be.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.205
Lynne! Mykaela!

01:09:10.578 --> 01:09:11.379
Guys.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:14.482
Let's do this already.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:19.554
They will find us and they
will get us out of here.

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:24.591
But how can you know that?
I know my husband.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:35.837
5 more minutes please.
5 more minutes.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:42.176
Lynne!
Mykaela!

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:44.412
Check those rooms over there.

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.291
Hello?

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.263
Mrs. Pierce?

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:06.401
Lynne! Mykaela!
Jeff!

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:12.073
Are you in there?
Dad!

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:16.678
Hey! Hey we're right here!
You guys in there?

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.147
We're here!
We're in here!

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.316
Alright what happened?

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:25.420
The roof caved in, we can't get through.
Alright, everyone stay calm.

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.155
We'll have you outta there
in a couple of minutes.

01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:28.056
Ok.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:33.661
Alita! Cade! On my 20 everyone!
I found them!

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.163
Let's go.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:40.046
We gotta go. We don't sit here any longer.
This is... We got to go! We gotta go.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.237
Alright.

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:46.841
So behind this wall. Roof caved
in, we gotta make a hole.

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:49.978
Tell me we have something for that.
Always come prepared, right Cap?

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.413
25 seconds.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:11:00.288
Could be dead for all I know.
We got to get out of here.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:06.060
Alright, I need you all to move away
from the door as far away as possible.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:07.829
Take cover.
We got it dad.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.331
Good. Look, we are going to
try to make an exit for you.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:13.101
You need to move away from the door.
Move fast!

01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:16.604
As far away as you can.
You got 25 seconds.

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:20.475
Now!
Run! Run!

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:22.610
Go, go, go!

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:28.016
Kai! What are you doing?
Help me!

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:29.284
What are you doing?
Help me.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:30.852
You heard the man, take cover.

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:34.856
Get down!

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.128
Any minute. They gotta get here.

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:52.473
Dad!
Lynne! Mykaela!

01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:00.181
Dad!
Ok. Everybody ok?

01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:02.550
Alright come on. We gotta go.
Come on. Come on!

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:05.019
Come on!
Come on!

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:07.355
Come on!

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:12.527
Come. Guys.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.770
Ok. Hurricane! Hurricane!

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.709
Bring her in! Bring her in!

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:32.714
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's go baby. Let's go.

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:38.019
I can't believe you guys are still alive.
It was all Mykaela.

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.687
She kept us going.

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:54.268
Hurricane! Come on!

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.608
Ah man!

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:16.257
Come on.
You straight?

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:19.394
We straight?
Good good good!

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:20.395
What now?

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:24.999
There's always another way. Let's find it.
Looks like we need another ride, huh?

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:28.736
She ain't kidding bro!
Incoming!

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:33.441
Cade!

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:49.624
The pyroclastic flow.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:56.464
It has to be.
We need to take cover, now!

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:59.534
How far does this museum go?
There's a basement, I saw it earlier.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:01.536
Alright. All the way down.
Move move move!

01:14:01.538 --> 01:14:04.605
Move come on! Let's go!

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:05.873
Go go go go!

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.876
It's gonna be ok. Ok?
Ok go!

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:14.348
Come on.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.384
Go go go come on!

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:18.686
Go go go come on!

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.232
Go go go!

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:44.912
Here. You're alright sweetie.
Is everyone alright?

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:46.380
Yeah.

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:52.386
So what do we do now man?
Just chill out down here?

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:57.258
Is this place even safe?
I hope so.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.869
Good thing about being in a tomb,
hopefully nothing will get in.

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:33.794
Anything?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.269
Straighten up soldier.
You know the risks.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.406
Give me that you jerk.

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:49.577
Easy alright? Easy.

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:03.591
Come on.
Let's take a look at that leg.

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.364
Here we go. What have you done.
Huh?

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:12.700
What have you done? Are you alright?
Can you put any weight on it?

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:13.801
Just a little.

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:17.605
So volcano experts what do we do now?
Any way outta here?

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:18.806
Just the way we came in.

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:23.244
So how long before
this thing is over?

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.013
I don't know.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.650
Days. Maybe.
Days?

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:33.154
Can't wait days.
We'll suffocate in here.

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:37.036
There must be a way to get word out.
To get someone to help us.

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:40.027
I'll find way out of here.
Alright?

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:57.878
Hey. Stairwell! Everyone out now!

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:03.618
Come on!

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:10.891
Come on we gotta get out!
No!

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.694
No Alita No!

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.665
Come on Come on!

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:28.309
Go cane go!

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.426
Dad, what do we do?

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.341
Climb. Everyone Climb! Go!

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:02.576
Come on!

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:08.582
Wait!

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:11.786
Help me!

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:14.455
Give me your hand!

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.035
It's alright! Come on!

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:33.407
Come on! Move!

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:51.892
Dad, I'm so sorry.
For what?

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.261
For making you come here.

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:59.500
You have nothing to be sorry
about. Ok? I'm proud of you.

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:00.501
Ok.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:18.986
What's happening?
I don't know.

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.501
I haven't read about
this in my books.

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:26.861
That sounds like a...

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:28.963
There!

01:19:32.235 --> 01:19:33.467
Yeah. Cane.

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:34.969
Come on. Come on.

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:40.674
Come on, come on! Move move move!

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:44.879
Go, go, go, go!
You're crazy you know that?

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:49.650
Yes. Hurry up I'm late
for a court-martial.

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:52.887
Come on.
Go go go!

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:55.322
Everyone strap in.

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.969
I didn't think you'd come for us.
You maniac.

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:11.906
The only reason why I'm here
is because 25 years ago I was

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.656
stuck in a dessert and
extracted by another maniac.

01:20:14.682 --> 01:20:16.443
And I didn't even know him!

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:18.646
Our debt s over. Now it's paid.

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:21.882
Paid? ha!
You owe me.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.551
Of course I do.

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.093
I didn't see all your team.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.665
We lost Alita and Cade.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:44.505
Sorry.
Let's get the rest of them home.

01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:48.275
Alright. It's got gonna be easy.
If only I could find some soup.

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:54.882
God dammit.

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:03.991
These air filters keep clogging. Come on.
You can do it. Come on!

01:21:03.993 --> 01:21:08.495
Is that it?
Yes. Yes! Once we're there.

01:21:08.497 --> 01:21:10.030
Carlo!

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:17.805
Fly fly fly.
I'm trying. I'm trying.

01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:22.443
I can't control this thing.

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:31.085
Hold on! Hold on!

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:46.901
Doing alright back there?
Yeah.

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:51.572
Carlo?

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.845
Captain?
You ok?

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:02.983
Captain? I'm a bloody Colonel.
You damn civilian.

01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:09.957
This bloody rock has gone
right through my shoulder.

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:11.992
Cane, front and center.

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:15.696
Bring Colonel Dylard
some first aid.

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:18.766
Right way sir.
And break up a morphine.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.771
This is can all over again.
You are whining like a chicken.

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.877
Try flying the plane a
little bit to the left--

01:22:29.879 --> 01:22:34.181
I seem to remember fluid
back in kata ara.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:36.850
And you were still
complaining weren't you?

01:22:40.923 --> 01:22:43.995
Give me some morphine
before you...

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.352
Guys.

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:48.022
I don't want to live
in Italy anymore.

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:54.261
Yeah.

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.965
<i>Reports are coming in, the
eruptions from Mt. Vesuvious</i>

01:23:57.967 --> 01:24:00.801
<i>are dying down, and the series
of earthquakes are dissipating.</i>

01:24:00.803 --> 01:24:04.972
<i>While badly damaged from this
disaster, Pompeii is still standing.</i>
