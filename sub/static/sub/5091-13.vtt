All right! All right!
Run it, run it, run it!

00:19.652 --> 00:21.085
Run it, run it!

00:21.086 --> 00:24.355
MAN 2: All right, boys,
keep turning it over!

00:34.400 --> 00:35.733
Everyone's friend.

00:35.734 --> 00:37.452
You don't fool me, Sammy.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.658
Jab, right hand.

00:44.543 --> 00:45.493
One, two, three.

00:46.495 --> 00:48.413
Come on, Rocky Balboa.

00:48.414 --> 00:49.664
We got a tour to do.

00:49.665 --> 00:51.816
Nice work, Jamie.
Same time next week?

00:51.817 --> 00:53.618
You got it, brother.
Okay.

00:53.619 --> 00:55.220
Lookin' good, kid.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.589
You only joined this boxing team
to make me feel

00:57.590 --> 00:58.840
fatter and older, right?

00:58.841 --> 01:00.225
I got to stay in shape, Sarge,

01:00.226 --> 01:01.476
in case somebody
tries to bully you.

01:01.477 --> 01:03.261
Oh, yeah? Yeah. You want to go around?

01:03.262 --> 01:04.479
What, with me?
Yeah.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.797
Nah. I don't want
to hurt you.

01:13.105 --> 01:14.906
Okay, Sammy, come on, mate,
just like we practiced.

01:14.907 --> 01:16.658
Leave the good ones alone,
put away the bad ones.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.910
Keep your head over the ball. Mm-hmm.

01:18.911 --> 01:20.028
Come on, Sammy, let's do it.

01:20.029 --> 01:22.747
Just watch.
I'm the Pakistani Derek Jeter.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.318
Come on, Sammy!

01:27.319 --> 01:29.754
You played your last game,
my friend.

01:33.726 --> 01:36.094
Come on, let's get this done.

01:43.636 --> 01:44.969
Great stuff!

01:47.106 --> 01:48.856
Come back! Get back, Sammy!

01:50.409 --> 01:51.542
Yeah, great stuff!

01:51.543 --> 01:52.894
Yeah!
Great stuff!

01:55.364 --> 01:57.565
Good job.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.930
Sammy!

02:11.931 --> 02:14.198
Someone call an ambulance!

02:14.199 --> 02:17.035
Sammy, hold on,
mate. Hold on.

02:22.441 --> 02:25.576
Queens, a distraught father
suffocated his two children,

02:25.577 --> 02:26.978
then shot himself.

02:26.979 --> 02:30.698
Two homicides in Manhattan...
one a robbery, one a domestic.

02:30.699 --> 02:32.016
One shooting in Brooklyn...

02:32.017 --> 02:33.768
bartender ran
down the street naked

02:33.769 --> 02:36.554
with a shotgun, fell
and shot off his big toe.

02:36.555 --> 02:38.573
Full moon.

02:38.574 --> 02:40.925
Tomorrow night. Don't
they know it's Saturday?

02:40.926 --> 02:42.427
Crime never sleeps, sir.

02:42.428 --> 02:43.661
When they invented electricity,

02:43.662 --> 02:45.964
they thought it would
eliminate crime at night.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.298
That didn't work.

02:47.299 --> 02:49.734
Commissioner, there's been
a shooting in Central Park.

02:51.303 --> 02:53.671
I'll be at my desk, sir.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.708
When my head of intelligence

02:56.709 --> 02:58.609
busts into my office
unannounced,

02:58.610 --> 03:00.611
he'd better have more than that.

03:00.612 --> 03:03.748
The victim was one of our
counterterrorism undercovers...

03:03.749 --> 03:05.450
Sammy Khan.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.053
How is he?

03:09.054 --> 03:10.605
He's been rushed to Bellevue.

03:10.606 --> 03:13.107
He's critical, but not likely.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.260
Why was Sammy shot?

03:16.261 --> 03:17.929
That's the big question.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.497
Is his cover still intact?

03:19.498 --> 03:20.931
Well, we better find an answer,

03:20.932 --> 03:23.368
or we're going to have to scrub
the whole operation.

Blue Bloods - Season 1, Episode 13
"Hall of Mirrors"

03:50.638 --> 03:53.439
I know why you called.
You do?

03:53.440 --> 03:54.974
Yeah. I think you're
overreacting, Dad.

03:54.975 --> 03:57.177
In what way?
Jack's wrist.

03:57.178 --> 03:58.811
He's going to be fine.
It's a sprain.

03:58.812 --> 04:01.281
It's not even broken.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.617
Deputy Commissioner.

04:04.618 --> 04:06.486
Danny.

04:06.487 --> 04:08.788
How did Jack hurt his wrist?

04:08.789 --> 04:10.323
Football.

04:10.324 --> 04:11.824
We're not here to talk

04:11.825 --> 04:13.326
about football, Danny.

04:13.327 --> 04:15.995
Then is this about
the Central Park shooting.

04:15.996 --> 04:17.630
The vic was a Pakistani.

04:17.630 --> 04:18.964
He's one of us.

04:18.966 --> 04:19.999
He's a cop?
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.035
His real name is
Samir Muhammad.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.270
His cover name is Sammy Khan.

04:24.271 --> 04:25.905
He's one of six
deep-cover operatives

04:25.906 --> 04:27.407
in our counterterrorism program.

04:27.408 --> 04:28.508
It's an elite program.

04:28.509 --> 04:30.476
Best and brightest
of the Muslim community

04:30.477 --> 04:32.378
dedicated
to fighting terrorism.

04:32.379 --> 04:33.379
What was he working on?

04:33.380 --> 04:35.215
Sammy had infiltrated
a sleeper cell,

04:35.216 --> 04:37.483
and he had also brought
another undercover cop

04:37.484 --> 04:38.851
into the cell, as well.

04:38.852 --> 04:40.753
If he was shot
because he was a cop...

04:40.754 --> 04:43.256
Then the other undercover cop's
life could be in jeopardy.

04:43.257 --> 04:45.658
Right. So why not just
pull this other man out?

04:45.659 --> 04:48.294
Well, we would,
but Sammy revealed to us

04:48.295 --> 04:49.963
some information
about a potential attack

04:49.964 --> 04:52.932
that the cell was planning
for two days from now,

04:52.933 --> 04:54.234
and it's supposed to involve

04:54.235 --> 04:56.202
major casualties
within the city.

04:56.203 --> 04:57.904
He knows the day of the attack,

04:57.905 --> 04:59.906
but the other specifics,
including the, uh, targets,

04:59.907 --> 05:02.208
have not been revealed to him
as of yet.

05:02.209 --> 05:04.460
With all due respect,
you got one man down,

05:04.461 --> 05:07.413
another man's life in danger...
why not just scrub the project?

05:07.414 --> 05:08.948
Because if we pull
the other undercover,

05:08.949 --> 05:11.618
we lose contact with the cell
and any chance of possibly

05:11.619 --> 05:13.119
stopping the attack.
You see?

05:13.120 --> 05:14.754
Okay, so why me?

05:14.755 --> 05:16.122
Because we need a detective

05:16.123 --> 05:18.157
that can make this look
just like any other

05:18.158 --> 05:19.759
standard investigation.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.663
And, Danny, we need somebody
we can trust, absolutely.

05:23.664 --> 05:25.231
That would be you.

05:25.232 --> 05:26.933
All right.

05:26.934 --> 05:29.002
Me and my partner
will get on it.

05:29.003 --> 05:30.136
No, no, no, no.

05:30.137 --> 05:33.172
She can work the case with you,
but you cannot,

05:33.173 --> 05:34.207
under any circumstances,

05:34.208 --> 05:35.508
tell her about Sammy's status.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.310
Well, she's my partner.

05:37.311 --> 05:38.911
That's going to be
a little tough.

05:38.912 --> 05:40.997
Danny, I know what I'm asking.

05:40.998 --> 05:42.382
Hopefully, the three of us

05:42.383 --> 05:44.851
are the only ones
who know he's a cop.

05:44.852 --> 05:46.619
His family doesn't even know.

05:48.756 --> 05:50.390
All right.

05:52.059 --> 05:55.461
You have 48 hours, Detective.

05:57.798 --> 05:59.983
Crime Scene just
dropped off his belongings.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.035
Vic's name is, uh, Sammy Khan.

06:02.036 --> 06:04.470
26 years old, out
of fair Pakistan.

06:04.471 --> 06:06.272
Perps wearing motorcycle helmets
with some design on it,

06:06.273 --> 06:07.573
so there's no
positive I.D.

06:07.574 --> 06:09.042
I was just planning
on sitting around

06:09.043 --> 06:10.243
doing nothing this weekend.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.644
I'm so thrilled to be working.

06:11.645 --> 06:13.946
Tell me about it. Why didn't
the north get this case?

06:13.947 --> 06:16.082
Well, you know, it's
Central Park, broad daylight...

06:16.083 --> 06:17.684
kind of thing scares
tourists away.

06:17.685 --> 06:19.585
Always falls down
to Major Case.

06:19.586 --> 06:21.454
Lucky for us, we were catching.

06:21.455 --> 06:23.156
Oh, wonderful.

06:28.729 --> 06:31.764
This is what we call
a frequent flyer job.

06:31.765 --> 06:33.132
Right over here.

06:33.133 --> 06:36.069
Somebody that calls us
all the time for unfounded jobs.

06:36.070 --> 06:37.887
Sometimes it's just
lonely old people

06:37.888 --> 06:39.889
who want someone to talk to.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.507
Sometimes it's crazies.

06:41.508 --> 06:44.176
Hey, it's New York, right? Who is she?

06:44.177 --> 06:45.945
Name is, uh, Melissa Samuels.

06:45.946 --> 06:47.180
Poor little rich girl.

06:47.181 --> 06:49.515
In the last year or so,
we've responded

06:49.516 --> 06:51.234
to a number of jobs
at this location.

06:51.235 --> 06:52.685
I mean, she's
a nice enough kid,

06:52.686 --> 06:54.070
but a little, you know, cuckoo.

06:54.071 --> 06:55.905
Uh, she tells us someone's
been in the apartment,

06:55.906 --> 06:58.691
moving things around,
blah, blah, blah.

06:58.692 --> 07:00.226
We never find nada.

07:01.195 --> 07:03.379
Sounds like a nut.
Sounds like a nut?

07:03.380 --> 07:05.498
She could be.
We'll find out.

07:05.499 --> 07:08.201
So, here's Sammy Khan's
stuff from the crime scene.

07:08.202 --> 07:10.369
"Jihadist be strong."

07:10.370 --> 07:12.138
This guy's a student?

07:12.139 --> 07:13.473
Yeah, right.
What does he study

07:13.474 --> 07:16.059
besides hating us
for being everything he's not?

07:16.060 --> 07:17.209
Engineering.

07:17.210 --> 07:18.377
According to his file,

07:18.378 --> 07:20.713
he's a grad student
at Hudson University.

07:20.714 --> 07:22.682
Great. So he's learning
how to build things

07:22.683 --> 07:24.817
so he can knock 'em down. Ah.

07:24.818 --> 07:26.385
And look at this.

07:28.088 --> 07:30.323
I think someone did
us a favor here.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.859
Maybe. For now,
he's just a kid who got shot.

07:32.860 --> 07:36.229
Excuse me, this from a man

07:36.230 --> 07:38.164
who decked someone
in Mannion's Bar

07:38.165 --> 07:40.266
when they said
we should get over 9/11?

07:40.267 --> 07:41.501
All right, look.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.419
When the Towers came down,
yeah, I was full of hate.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.371
Very much so.
Like every New Yorker,

07:45.372 --> 07:46.706
I wanted revenge...
I went active

07:46.707 --> 07:48.307
in the Marines;
I went to Iraq.

07:48.308 --> 07:49.375
You know what I learned after

07:49.376 --> 07:50.877
two tours
and all the madness I seen?

07:50.878 --> 07:53.212
Aside from the crazy ones,

07:53.213 --> 07:55.281
we all want
pretty much the same thing.

07:55.282 --> 07:58.251
We want food on our tables,
a roof over our heads

07:58.252 --> 07:59.552
and happy, healthy kids.

08:01.488 --> 08:03.189
Is that Sammy's phone?

08:05.091 --> 08:06.592
Look at that.
Farrah's calling.

08:06.593 --> 08:08.928
Oh. Guy's got a thing
for Charlie's Angels.

08:08.929 --> 08:11.197
Farrah's an Arabic name...
it means "joy."

08:11.198 --> 08:12.198
Hello?

08:12.199 --> 08:13.332
Sammy?
Farrah.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.534
Sammy, is that you?

08:14.535 --> 08:15.601
Hello?

08:15.602 --> 08:17.203
She hung up.

08:17.204 --> 08:19.305
Maybe she didn't expect
anyone to be answering.

08:19.306 --> 08:20.573
Yeah, you know
what I'm going to do?

08:20.574 --> 08:21.707
I'm going to give this
to Gormley,

08:21.708 --> 08:23.442
see if he can get dumps
on the phones

08:23.443 --> 08:24.577
and figure out who Farrah is.

08:24.578 --> 08:26.546
I'll be back.

08:36.121 --> 08:37.756
How you doing?

08:37.758 --> 08:40.308
Good. How are you?
All right.

08:51.972 --> 08:54.173
Need to ask you a few questions

08:54.174 --> 08:56.409
about one of your congregation...
a Sammy Khan?

08:56.410 --> 08:58.778
Oh, yes. I heard
the horrible news.

08:58.779 --> 09:00.530
He was a very
respectful young man.

09:00.531 --> 09:02.181
Really? Well, would you
know of anybody

09:02.182 --> 09:03.749
who might have
a problem with him?

09:03.750 --> 09:05.668
Any reason somebody
would want to shoot him?

09:05.669 --> 09:06.836
A young man like Samir?

09:06.837 --> 09:08.487
I can't imagine
why anybody would want

09:08.488 --> 09:11.174
to hurt him. Well, you know, I spoke
to the local community affairs officer.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.758
He told me some
of the young guys

09:12.759 --> 09:14.227
are going more
and more radical here,

09:14.228 --> 09:16.796
including Sammy Khan.
It is a constant struggle.

09:16.797 --> 09:18.831
But they are like
outsiders of all kinds...

09:18.832 --> 09:20.833
they are defensive
about their identity.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.002
Oh, is that what
we're calling it now?

09:23.003 --> 09:25.671
We stress the true
interpretation

09:25.672 --> 09:28.207
of the Koran... peace.

09:29.309 --> 09:31.811
I hope he recovers fully.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.582
Take off your
shoes; put on the scarf.

09:38.552 --> 09:40.853
Listen, I'm going
to need the names

09:40.854 --> 09:42.555
of some of the younger
radical members

09:42.556 --> 09:44.073
this officer was talking about.

09:44.074 --> 09:46.125
I'm not sure what
you mean by "radical."

09:46.126 --> 09:47.593
You know, extremists...
people who use

09:47.594 --> 09:49.729
their faith as justification
for their behavior.

09:49.730 --> 09:51.764
I cannot condemn someone

09:51.765 --> 09:53.666
for the tenor of their belief.

09:53.667 --> 09:56.702
If I think they are dangerous,
that is a different story.

09:56.703 --> 09:58.804
Does shooting qualify
as dangerous?

09:58.805 --> 10:00.206
You are Catholic, yes?

10:00.207 --> 10:02.508
Yes, I am. Do you have any idea

10:02.509 --> 10:04.777
how many of your churches
were burned in this city

10:04.778 --> 10:06.545
when you were
the new people in town?

10:06.546 --> 10:09.415
Uh, actually, yes, I... Look, we
don't have time for this, okay?

10:09.416 --> 10:10.449
Excuse me.

10:10.450 --> 10:11.817
Now, here's what I need,
all right?

10:11.818 --> 10:13.185
I understand the history
of this city.

10:13.186 --> 10:15.555
Now, if you understand it,
you know that the Catholics

10:15.556 --> 10:16.689
learned to trust the cops,

10:16.690 --> 10:18.257
and then the cops helped them.

10:18.258 --> 10:20.192
Okay, and that's what I
need from you right now...

10:20.193 --> 10:21.294
I need you to trust me.

10:21.295 --> 10:22.562
And you have to understand

10:22.563 --> 10:24.664
that I'm just trying to
find out who shot Sammy.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.233
Okay.
I will help you however I can.

10:27.234 --> 10:28.701
All right.

10:31.405 --> 10:33.706
We got to go.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.677
I know, I have no proof,

10:37.678 --> 10:40.379
but I am sure that somebody
has been in here.

10:40.380 --> 10:42.081
No sign of forced entry?

10:42.082 --> 10:44.133
Nothing stolen?
Anything amiss?

10:44.134 --> 10:47.019
My books... I always arrange
alphabetically by title.

10:47.020 --> 10:49.689
Now look...
they're all out of whack.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.190
Mm-hmm.

10:51.191 --> 10:55.094
My silverware... I always lay
the knives north to south,

10:55.095 --> 10:57.262
the spoons the opposite.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.332
Aside from the books

10:59.333 --> 11:01.300
and the spoons being moved,
what makes you think

11:01.301 --> 11:02.935
someone else has been in here?

11:02.936 --> 11:05.905
When I walk in the door,
I-I get this feeling.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.342
The best way
I can describe it is,

11:09.343 --> 11:11.877
it's like...
everything is dirty,

11:11.878 --> 11:13.846
even if you can't see it.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.048
I see you have
a security camera.

11:16.049 --> 11:17.883
Has it picked anything up?

11:17.884 --> 11:19.218
No.

11:19.219 --> 11:21.587
My brother told me
I needed to install it.

11:21.588 --> 11:24.123
It seemed to help
for a couple of months,

11:24.124 --> 11:25.725
but then, one day, I came home,

11:25.726 --> 11:27.560
and my stereo
was playing Rachmaninoff.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.844
Who's that?

11:28.845 --> 11:30.963
The guy that makes my vodka?

11:34.234 --> 11:37.436
Does anyone else have a key
to the apartment besides you?

11:37.437 --> 11:39.839
No. I'm alone.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.140
Hmm.

11:41.141 --> 11:44.176
Uh, except my housekeeper
comes twice a week,

11:44.177 --> 11:45.611
but she is very
protective of me.

11:45.612 --> 11:47.113
We checked her out
from stem to stern.

11:47.114 --> 11:50.983
Actually, uh, we have to be
getting back on patrol, so...

11:50.984 --> 11:52.785
You don't believe me, do you?

11:52.786 --> 11:54.787
I have no reason
not to believe you, miss.

11:54.788 --> 11:56.339
He doesn't believe me.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.557
Um, this is

11:58.558 --> 12:00.126
Widener Library, right?

12:00.127 --> 12:01.827
You went to Harvard?
Yes.

12:01.828 --> 12:05.131
The sixth generation of
Samuels to matriculate.

12:05.132 --> 12:07.332
I'm the first generation
of my family to go.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.001
And now you're a cop?

12:09.002 --> 12:10.386
Yeah.

12:10.387 --> 12:12.204
That's pretty cool.

12:12.205 --> 12:14.523
Noble, actually.

12:16.176 --> 12:17.843
I'll be outside.

12:17.844 --> 12:19.478
I don't want
to accidentally witness

12:19.479 --> 12:21.731
any secret Ivy League
handshakes here.

12:30.290 --> 12:32.742
Did you take these?

12:32.743 --> 12:34.260
Yes. That's what I do.

12:34.261 --> 12:36.695
I have a studio on 28th Street.

12:38.832 --> 12:41.434
They're beautiful.

12:43.103 --> 12:45.838
Uh, thank you.

12:47.724 --> 12:51.644
I'm going to give
you, uh, my number.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.913
If you have a problem,

12:53.914 --> 12:57.900
you can call me... anytime.

12:59.252 --> 13:00.736
Okay?

13:09.096 --> 13:12.064
Commissioner, we
need to start thinking

13:12.065 --> 13:14.133
about pulling the plug
on the operation.

13:14.134 --> 13:17.036
Where are we at this
exact moment in time?

13:17.037 --> 13:18.471
Our window's closing fast.

13:18.472 --> 13:20.740
I just got off the phone
with Detective Reagan.

13:20.741 --> 13:22.975
They've made very little headway
in the investigation,

13:22.976 --> 13:26.212
though he is still aggressively
pursuing every angle.

13:26.213 --> 13:28.147
What about our other operative?

13:28.148 --> 13:29.415
Status quo from him.

13:29.416 --> 13:32.418
Uh, but there has been
a, uh... a serious uptick

13:32.419 --> 13:34.086
in Internet conversation...

13:34.087 --> 13:36.756
chatter about, uh,
possible attacks.

13:37.891 --> 13:39.141
Tough choice, Frank.

13:39.142 --> 13:40.259
If Sammy's not been compromised,

13:40.260 --> 13:42.528
then pulling the plug
might be a big mistake.

13:42.529 --> 13:44.497
Two years worth
of work will be lost,

13:44.498 --> 13:47.266
and God knows what else
we might lose as a result.

13:47.267 --> 13:48.601
On the other hand,

13:48.602 --> 13:52.972
our additional undercover
is still out there... exposed.

13:56.343 --> 13:58.277
We're still a go.

13:58.278 --> 13:59.812
We've got time.

13:59.813 --> 14:01.380
Just make the most of it.

14:01.381 --> 14:02.815
You got it.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.021
When was the last time

14:20.022 --> 14:22.423
we were given unlimited
overtime to chase a case?

14:22.424 --> 14:24.091
I don't know, when Officer Martin
was killed, maybe.

14:24.092 --> 14:25.459
Are you complaining
about overtime?

14:25.460 --> 14:27.044
No. I'm just saying.

14:27.045 --> 14:28.946
Some kid gets shot
playing cricket,

14:28.947 --> 14:30.231
and money is no object?

14:30.232 --> 14:31.632
I don't know. GORMLEY: Hey!

14:31.633 --> 14:33.100
Check this out.

14:33.101 --> 14:35.703
We finally got the phone
dumps on Sammy Khan's cell.

14:35.704 --> 14:37.471
We found your
mysterious Farrah.

14:37.472 --> 14:39.173
Oh, yeah?
A Farrah Ahmed.

14:39.174 --> 14:42.143
She made several dozen phone
calls over the last month,

14:42.144 --> 14:43.344
but get this.

14:43.345 --> 14:45.529
The phone calls stop the
day before Sammy was shot.

14:45.530 --> 14:46.647
You kidding me?
No.

14:46.648 --> 14:47.982
And then the phone
call that came in

14:47.983 --> 14:49.516
when you guys had the cell.

14:49.517 --> 14:51.018
We got a pedigree on Farrah?

14:51.019 --> 14:52.720
Not much.
Pakistani national.

14:52.721 --> 14:55.072
She goes to the same college
as, uh, Sammy Khan... Hudson.

14:55.073 --> 14:56.390
Excuse me.

14:56.391 --> 14:57.558
Hey, babe.

14:57.559 --> 14:59.543
No, I'm not going to make it
to church.

14:59.544 --> 15:00.761
I don't know!

15:00.762 --> 15:03.531
If-if I can make it
to dinner, I will, all right?

15:03.532 --> 15:05.883
I'll try!

15:05.884 --> 15:07.919
I'll see you at dinner.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.738
Thanks.

15:12.207 --> 15:13.641
He's all bent out of shape

15:13.642 --> 15:14.642
'cause he's going to miss
Sunday's dinner?

15:14.643 --> 15:16.010
Yeah.

15:16.011 --> 15:17.612
Boo-hoo.

15:21.984 --> 15:24.885
Two days in a row
with this crap.

15:24.886 --> 15:26.587
This broad is just
a plain whack-adoo.

15:26.588 --> 15:28.406
Who says she ain't moving
the stuff herself, huh?

15:28.407 --> 15:30.274
Yeah, but she's not making
up the scared part.

15:30.275 --> 15:31.492
She was really frightened.

15:31.493 --> 15:32.760
Hey, we're not in the business

15:32.761 --> 15:34.195
of making the bogeyman go away.

15:34.196 --> 15:36.397
A real crime perpetrated
by a real criminal? Yeah.

15:36.398 --> 15:37.898
That's our bailiwick.
Right.

15:37.899 --> 15:40.067
And besides,
if she looked like a linebacker,

15:40.068 --> 15:42.086
you'd think
she's nuts, too. Yeah.

15:43.238 --> 15:45.206
I'm not imagining things.

15:45.207 --> 15:47.375
Oh, all right. Go ahead.

15:49.144 --> 15:54.215
Look. Every piece of furniture
has been moved.

15:54.216 --> 15:55.299
And-and look here.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.584
Someone turned all my work
upside down.

16:06.395 --> 16:08.763
What else has to happen
for you to believe me?

16:08.764 --> 16:10.364
Please, miss, please.

16:14.302 --> 16:17.538
I hate to ask this, but
you're on medication?

16:19.775 --> 16:22.009
You're going to be
like all the rest.

16:24.746 --> 16:26.614
There's nothing wrong
with being anxious.

16:26.615 --> 16:28.549
If you came home to this...

16:28.550 --> 16:31.819
Melissa, the precinct
is two blocks from here. I...

16:31.820 --> 16:34.121
I drive past your house
to and from work.

16:34.122 --> 16:36.057
I'll keep an eye out
for you, okay?

16:42.230 --> 16:44.598
I need you to have these.

16:46.985 --> 16:48.869
No, please. That's-that's
not what we do, okay?

16:48.870 --> 16:51.572
No. I'm going to Chicago
for a week just to get away.

16:51.573 --> 16:53.307
If you see anyone
while I'm gone...

16:53.308 --> 16:54.492
Hey.

16:54.493 --> 16:55.910
So, uh,

16:55.911 --> 16:57.845
we ready, kid?

16:57.846 --> 16:59.646
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:59.647 --> 17:01.849
Have a nice... nice trip.

17:06.121 --> 17:08.155
Okay.

17:10.208 --> 17:12.259
Farrah's in Pakistan.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.178
Since when?
Friday.

17:14.179 --> 17:15.996
Her roommate came home
to a note from her

17:15.997 --> 17:18.348
saying she had to rush off
to Islamabad... her dad was sick.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.000
So it wasn't
a planned vacation, then?

17:20.001 --> 17:22.502
Or a well-planned
vacation. You think she,

17:22.503 --> 17:24.438
uh, was involved
in the hit on Sammy?

17:24.439 --> 17:25.906
I'd sure as hell
love to find out.

17:25.906 --> 17:28.743
You know, you could have made
those phone calls in here.

17:28.744 --> 17:32.480
You know, my wife... she's
being a pain in the neck.

17:32.481 --> 17:34.181
I'm going to head over
to the old man's for dinner.

17:34.182 --> 17:35.349
Catch you when I get back.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.151
Yep.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.658
Hey, Nick, I heard
you played some serious game.

17:44.659 --> 17:47.294
Yeah. One more win,
and we make the tournament.

17:47.295 --> 17:48.245
Whoa.

17:48.246 --> 17:51.532
I wish Dad could have seen it.

17:51.533 --> 17:53.000
She scored 20 points.
Ooh.

17:53.001 --> 17:54.201
And her coach said

17:54.202 --> 17:56.170
that she's the best player
on the team.

17:56.171 --> 17:58.222
Of course.
She takes after me.

17:58.223 --> 17:59.673
Only I couldn't jump.

17:59.674 --> 18:01.509
Didn't you see the movie,
Grandpa?

18:01.510 --> 18:03.094
White Men Can't Jump?

18:04.930 --> 18:06.614
Nobody jumped in basketball
back then, right, Grandpa?

18:06.615 --> 18:08.232
Set shots ruled the day. Yep.

18:08.233 --> 18:10.217
Well, Grandpa was probably
like a human windmill,

18:10.218 --> 18:11.718
just throwing those
elbows everywhere.

18:11.719 --> 18:13.721
If I could run like Nicky,

18:13.722 --> 18:15.189
I wouldn't have had
to make up for it

18:15.190 --> 18:16.857
by throwing elbows.

18:16.858 --> 18:18.325
Well, if I had her speed,

18:18.326 --> 18:20.561
I'm sure I would have
saved Dad a bundle

18:20.562 --> 18:22.062
on college tuition.

18:22.063 --> 18:23.414
Nah. That was money well spent.

18:23.415 --> 18:24.565
Hey.

18:24.566 --> 18:25.666
Sorry I'm late.
There he is.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.501
Hey.
Sorry about earlier.

18:27.502 --> 18:28.919
Oh, that's all right.
Tough case.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.004
Where's Grandpa?

18:30.005 --> 18:32.473
I don't know.
I think he's working.

18:32.474 --> 18:33.924
Dad, Nicky scored 20 points
in her basketball game.

18:33.925 --> 18:35.142
Oh, yeah?

18:35.143 --> 18:36.343
Hey, congrats.
Thanks.

18:36.344 --> 18:37.545
Just like your uncle.

18:37.546 --> 18:39.280
You know, if you'd stayed
with basketball

18:39.281 --> 18:40.714
and gave up football,

18:40.715 --> 18:41.882
you wouldn't be on the DL.

18:41.883 --> 18:43.050
Oh, I love football.

18:43.051 --> 18:44.418
You love football.

18:44.419 --> 18:45.719
I do.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.188
So much
for first grade detectives

18:47.189 --> 18:48.956
not working Sundays, huh?
Well, you know.

18:48.957 --> 18:50.224
What are you going to do?

18:50.225 --> 18:52.226
Well, if the guy wasn't
shot in Central Park...

18:52.227 --> 18:54.094
one of the most famous
places on Earth...

18:54.095 --> 18:55.312
your husband wouldn't
be working Sundays.

18:55.313 --> 18:56.897
Hey, come on.
Give me a break.

18:56.898 --> 18:58.566
You think I want to miss this?

18:58.567 --> 18:59.800
Well, you're right.

18:59.801 --> 19:01.652
Media wouldn't have
covered it after day one.

19:01.653 --> 19:03.487
Day one, page 17.

19:03.488 --> 19:05.456
Crime in this town
has always been about

19:05.457 --> 19:07.124
location, location, location.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.492
Well, especially
when it happens

19:08.493 --> 19:10.244
to rich people in
rich neighborhoods.

19:10.245 --> 19:12.279
Sorry.
Grandpa, you're here.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.964
How's the wrist, Jack?

19:13.965 --> 19:15.182
Ah, no biggie.

19:15.183 --> 19:16.950
Grandpa, you're late
for Sunday dinner.

19:16.951 --> 19:18.118
You're never late.

19:18.119 --> 19:20.855
Well, I was working, Sean.

19:20.856 --> 19:22.673
Here.

19:22.674 --> 19:24.175
Eat.
Thank you.

19:24.176 --> 19:26.060
You know, Erin, it's not only

19:26.061 --> 19:27.511
rich people
who, uh, read the newspapers.

19:27.512 --> 19:29.697
In fact, it wasn't even
a rich guy who got shot.

19:29.698 --> 19:30.814
It was a poor immigrant

19:30.815 --> 19:32.349
from Pakistan.

19:32.350 --> 19:34.568
Okay, but if he had been
shot in Marcus Garvey Park,

19:34.569 --> 19:36.654
no one would know his name,
and you wouldn't be

19:36.655 --> 19:38.572
working on Sunday.
Ah, fair enough.

19:38.573 --> 19:41.525
I'm just saying that mothers
in the projects cry just as hard

19:41.526 --> 19:42.993
as the ones on Park Ave.

19:42.994 --> 19:45.979
Erin, cops can't cure
society's ills.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.982
It's a path to foolishness.

19:47.983 --> 19:49.683
What do you think, Dad?

19:49.684 --> 19:53.520
Well, I'd like to think
we chase all cases the same,

19:53.521 --> 19:55.956
but media drives
the resources, so...

19:55.957 --> 19:58.559
the press cases
get the attention.

20:04.716 --> 20:06.166
How's it with your partner?

20:06.167 --> 20:08.669
Terrible. I'm not good at
lying to my partner, Dad.

20:08.670 --> 20:09.970
I hate it, too.

20:09.971 --> 20:14.208
Intel is investigating threats
against Sammy on the Internet.

20:14.209 --> 20:15.409
Yeah? We know who posted them?

20:15.410 --> 20:17.061
No, but if they're made
by radicals,

20:17.062 --> 20:18.679
we're pulling the plug.
I'll stay on top of it, Dad.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.514
A little help in the kitchen?

20:21.917 --> 20:23.984
Okay. No need to know.

20:25.754 --> 20:27.054
And the girl, Farrah?

20:27.055 --> 20:28.589
I'd love to hear
what she has to say,

20:28.590 --> 20:30.040
but she skipped town
right before the hit.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.492
Well, our people
in Pakistan are on it.

20:31.493 --> 20:33.060
We got operatives in Pakistan?

20:33.061 --> 20:35.462
Secrets and lies.

20:36.331 --> 20:38.365
Look, you have no need to know.

20:38.366 --> 20:39.833
We'll find the girl.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.502
That's fine, Dad.
I don't want to know.

20:41.503 --> 20:42.736
But what I need is more time.

20:42.737 --> 20:45.205
Well, shoot, Danny,
you got 24 hours.

20:45.206 --> 20:47.391
Great.

21:13.935 --> 21:16.420
Excuse me, you don't...

21:21.509 --> 21:23.510
Hey, you, stop! Oh! Oh!

21:24.546 --> 21:26.547
Officer needs assistance.

21:26.548 --> 21:27.982
Shots fired!

21:29.648 --> 21:31.599
We got nothing from the
attempted hit at the hospital.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.901
Perp wore gloves and a mask.

21:32.902 --> 21:35.236
Talk about trying
to finish up a job.

21:35.237 --> 21:36.337
Well, good thing

21:36.338 --> 21:37.939
they moved Sammy Khan
to a different hospital.

21:37.940 --> 21:40.441
Yeah, whoever tried that
sure wanted him dead. Yeah.

21:40.442 --> 21:41.643
Never heard of that
before, though.

21:41.644 --> 21:43.027
Why would they do that?

21:44.446 --> 21:46.080
Intel tracked down
those Internet threats

21:46.081 --> 21:48.583
to an Islamic shop over
on Steinway Street.

21:48.584 --> 21:50.084
Steinway.
We better get going.

21:50.085 --> 21:52.921
This time of day, the traffic's
going to be impossible.

22:00.029 --> 22:04.132
"Early in the morning,
when the birds were still nesting,

22:04.133 --> 22:06.501
"I mounted my steed.

22:06.502 --> 22:09.103
"Well-bred was he, long-bodied,

22:09.104 --> 22:12.506
"outstripping
the wild beasts in speed.

22:15.110 --> 22:17.645
"Swift to attack,
to flee, to turn,

22:17.646 --> 22:18.913
"yet firm

22:18.914 --> 22:22.016
as a rock swept down
by the torrent."

22:22.017 --> 22:23.184
Is that Kipling?

22:25.621 --> 22:27.589
No, it's the Hanged Poems.

22:27.590 --> 22:29.591
Ancient Arabian.

22:29.592 --> 22:32.660
Sammy's favorite.

22:32.661 --> 22:36.531
"Bay-colored and so smooth,
the saddle slips from him,

22:36.532 --> 22:40.101
"as the rain
from a smooth stone,

22:40.102 --> 22:44.072
thin but full of life."

22:48.811 --> 22:53.398
"Fire boils within him like the
snorting of a boiling kettle.

22:53.399 --> 22:55.783
He continues at full gallop."

23:05.327 --> 23:06.661
You the owner?

23:06.662 --> 23:08.363
The manager, Malik.

23:08.364 --> 23:10.398
Is that the only computer
you got in here?

23:10.399 --> 23:12.367
That is our only computer,
and as you can see,

23:12.368 --> 23:13.735
anyone is free to use it.

23:13.736 --> 23:16.037
Is there a sign-in book
or a log-in or something?

23:16.038 --> 23:17.088
No.

23:17.089 --> 23:18.740
Sammy Khan ever
use that computer?

23:19.575 --> 23:21.276
What do you want?

23:21.277 --> 23:23.211
Well, we want world peace,
but for now,

23:23.212 --> 23:24.946
we'll settle for finding
the guy who used

23:24.947 --> 23:26.414
this computer to
threaten Sammy Khan.

23:26.415 --> 23:27.882
I can't help you with that.

23:27.883 --> 23:29.050
Do you know Sammy Khan?

23:29.051 --> 23:31.552
He... comes in here
occasionally.

23:31.553 --> 23:33.688
Yeah? He have any problems
with anyone?

23:33.689 --> 23:35.690
I never saw him have a problem.

23:35.691 --> 23:38.359
Do you know anyone
who would want him dead?

23:38.360 --> 23:39.811
That's an absurd question.

23:39.812 --> 23:41.863
Actually, it's not an absurd
question. You know what?

23:41.864 --> 23:43.831
We're going to borrow
your computer here.

23:43.832 --> 23:46.034
Uh, you can't take that.

23:46.035 --> 23:47.035
Actually, we can.

23:47.036 --> 23:48.152
This is a warrant that says so.

23:48.153 --> 23:51.406
Uh, we use that for our files,
our accounting.

23:51.407 --> 23:52.957
Yeah, well,
Best Buy's having a sale.

23:52.958 --> 23:54.158
Get yourself a new one.

23:56.845 --> 23:58.880
But...

24:01.050 --> 24:03.217
You catch that motorcycle
helmet in there, partner?

24:03.218 --> 24:06.421
Hey, I'm not blind, partner.

24:07.973 --> 24:10.958
Black Kawasaki 750,

24:10.959 --> 24:12.560
just like the shooter had.

24:13.762 --> 24:15.763
I'll run the plate.

24:22.988 --> 24:24.405
Reagan, what's the deal
with this case?

24:24.406 --> 24:25.740
What do you mean?
Kid got shot...

24:25.741 --> 24:27.275
we're trying to
figure out who do it.

24:27.276 --> 24:29.977
No, it seems like you're
chasing this case on your own,

24:29.978 --> 24:31.696
and you're giving me
half the information.

24:31.697 --> 24:33.514
I mean, what is it?

24:33.515 --> 24:35.533
What, you don't trust me, or...

24:35.534 --> 24:38.786
you don't think
I'm a good detective?

24:38.787 --> 24:41.356
It's just the Central Park
thing, Jackie, you know?

24:41.357 --> 24:43.374
There's a lot of...
lot of pressure,

24:43.375 --> 24:46.377
lot of heat from
One PP, you know.

24:46.378 --> 24:47.679
Hey, this is Reagan.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.683
Yeah, look, I need you to
run a plate for me, okay?

24:53.535 --> 24:55.370
Yeah?

24:55.371 --> 24:56.938
Counselor?

24:56.939 --> 24:57.805
Hey.

24:57.806 --> 24:59.507
Hey. You know, every time

24:59.508 --> 25:00.858
you show up in that uniform,

25:00.859 --> 25:02.844
all the women in the office
are giggling

25:02.845 --> 25:04.862
like schoolgirls
for the rest of the week.

25:04.863 --> 25:08.232
Thanks for looking into this
Melissa Samuels for me. Yeah.

25:08.233 --> 25:10.017
Happy to help
my kid brother out.

25:10.018 --> 25:11.486
Though I don't like
bending the rules.

25:11.487 --> 25:13.621
I just think there's more
to this story, you know?

25:13.622 --> 25:15.156
I'd like to help out if I can.

25:15.157 --> 25:17.909
Well, it turns out
Melissa Samuels' parents

25:17.910 --> 25:20.061
were killed in a plane crash.

25:20.062 --> 25:21.429
Their Gulf Stream went down

25:21.430 --> 25:23.798
when they were trying to land
in Martha's Vineyard.

25:23.799 --> 25:25.933
Melissa and the pilot
were the only survivors.

25:25.934 --> 25:28.336
That's enough to explain her
being a bit fragile. Well, it was

25:28.337 --> 25:31.072
also enough for her family to
have her committed to Fairwick,

25:31.073 --> 25:32.924
a mental health facility
favored by the well-off.

25:32.925 --> 25:35.309
She was there for eight months,
and she was released

25:35.310 --> 25:38.446
on a diagnosis
of acute anxiety.

25:38.447 --> 25:39.914
Renzulli says if
she keeps calling,

25:39.915 --> 25:42.650
we might have to EDP her,
send her down to Bellevue.

25:42.651 --> 25:44.736
Well, it might be hard...
she's not in danger

25:44.737 --> 25:46.187
of hurting herself
or others, so...

25:46.188 --> 25:48.356
But every time you guys
get called down there...

25:48.357 --> 25:49.657
I know, I know.

25:49.658 --> 25:51.626
It takes resources
off the street.

25:51.627 --> 25:53.861
You know, Jamie,
you have a really big heart,

25:53.862 --> 25:55.963
and that will never
be a bad thing,

25:55.964 --> 25:57.465
no matter what Danny says.

25:59.001 --> 26:01.602
But you keep trying
to make the world right,

26:01.603 --> 26:03.871
being a cop
is going to eat you alive.

26:03.872 --> 26:05.606
I've seen it happen
a hundred times.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.041
I know...
I know that, sis.

26:07.042 --> 26:08.443
I'm just,
uh... just...

26:08.444 --> 26:10.845
I'm just trying to do the
right thing here. I know.

26:10.846 --> 26:12.747
And I love you for it.

26:12.748 --> 26:15.650
Sooner or later, these things
usually come to a head,

26:15.651 --> 26:18.653
so just trust your gut,
and if you think she's legit,

26:18.654 --> 26:20.054
keep an eye on her.

26:20.055 --> 26:22.490
Thanks.

26:32.968 --> 26:34.302
Reagan.

26:34.303 --> 26:36.404
Yeah.

26:36.405 --> 26:38.072
You're kidding me.

26:38.073 --> 26:39.440
Great.

26:39.441 --> 26:41.609
Best news I've
heard in 36 hours.

26:41.610 --> 26:43.377
What's 36 hours?
The bike

26:43.378 --> 26:44.778
belongs to Malik.
And get this...

26:44.779 --> 26:46.614
the bike tripped off a
license plate reader

26:46.615 --> 26:48.666
on Central Park West two
minutes after the shooting.

26:48.667 --> 26:49.667
He was fleeing the scene...

26:49.668 --> 26:51.552
so it puts him
right in our kill zone.

26:52.504 --> 26:54.555
Well, what do you know.

26:54.556 --> 26:56.507
Speak of the devil.

26:56.508 --> 26:57.791
Where is he going?

27:02.464 --> 27:04.665
Hey.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.867
Hey! Where you going?!

27:08.804 --> 27:10.655
Stop!

27:17.412 --> 27:19.914
Hey!

27:19.915 --> 27:21.616
Come here!

27:25.354 --> 27:28.206
Nice try, scumbag.
Get up.

27:28.207 --> 27:29.824
So it's like this, Malik.

27:29.825 --> 27:31.192
Your motorcycle
was at the scene

27:31.193 --> 27:32.710
of a shooting, and
the death threats

27:32.711 --> 27:35.129
against the victim came
from a computer in your store.

27:35.130 --> 27:37.164
So this is no coincidence
why we picked you up,

27:37.165 --> 27:39.467
so don't start any of this
religious persecution crap.

27:39.468 --> 27:41.936
This is America... there is
no religious persecution here.

27:41.937 --> 27:44.071
Okay...

27:44.072 --> 27:46.023
you posted these threats
on the Internet.

27:46.024 --> 27:47.575
"The so-called brother
will burn.

27:47.576 --> 27:49.377
"He will suffer in the grave

27:49.378 --> 27:51.012
for eternity."
Come on, Malik.

27:51.647 --> 27:52.780
Why'd you shoot Sammy?

27:52.781 --> 27:54.198
You are accusing me

27:54.199 --> 27:55.783
of being a violent person?

27:55.784 --> 27:58.035
You are the one who
carries a gun every day

27:58.036 --> 27:59.687
of your life...
what does that say about you?

27:59.688 --> 28:01.322
You know what it says
about me? It says I'll do

28:01.323 --> 28:02.540
whatever it takes to
protect my city.

28:02.541 --> 28:04.525
Now, why'd you
shoot Sammy Khan?

28:04.526 --> 28:06.327
I did not shoot Sammy.

28:06.328 --> 28:08.262
Then, who did?
Yeah, who did?

28:08.263 --> 28:10.248
With the same gun we
found in your apartment.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.505
What kind of deal
can you make for me?

28:17.506 --> 28:19.273
And there it is.

28:19.274 --> 28:20.675
Calculus of despair.

28:21.677 --> 28:23.427
Give me a second.

28:32.521 --> 28:35.022
Here's the only deal you're
going to get, you little punk.

28:35.023 --> 28:37.124
Your ass is going to rot
inside a prison cell

28:37.125 --> 28:39.327
until they replace yellow cabs
with spaceships in this city,

28:39.328 --> 28:41.829
you don't tell me who the hell
shot Sammy Khan right now.

28:41.830 --> 28:44.165
Do you understand me?

28:44.166 --> 28:46.367
Who did it?

28:48.337 --> 28:49.403
Who did it?!

28:49.404 --> 28:50.538
I said, who?!

28:50.539 --> 28:52.623
My roommate Raheem,
he shot Sammy.

28:52.624 --> 28:53.808
Why?

28:53.809 --> 28:55.343
Why did Raheem shoot Sammy?

28:55.344 --> 28:56.744
He would not tell me.

28:56.745 --> 29:01.816
He would only say,
"Sammy deserves to die."

29:17.432 --> 29:19.734
Hey, Jamie, man,
what's going on, bro?

29:19.735 --> 29:21.702
I'll be right back, Coach.
I forgot something.

29:34.850 --> 29:36.667
Melissa?

29:38.353 --> 29:40.120
Hey!

29:49.564 --> 29:51.015
It's okay.

29:51.016 --> 29:52.516
It's okay. It's okay.

29:52.517 --> 29:53.818
Everything's okay.

29:53.819 --> 29:55.736
I knew you believed me.

29:55.737 --> 29:57.405
It's all right. I got him.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.361
Oh, my God.

30:03.362 --> 30:05.196
It's my brother.

30:05.197 --> 30:06.864
My own brother?

30:06.865 --> 30:09.000
What? No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

30:09.001 --> 30:11.018
No, it's all right. I got him.
I got him. You're okay.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.036
Everything's all right.

30:12.037 --> 30:13.371
He can't hurt you.

30:20.429 --> 30:22.013
You're down to three hours.
What do you got?

30:22.014 --> 30:23.764
Well, we got an I.D.
on the shooter.

30:23.765 --> 30:25.516
He's a Raheem Davi out of
Pakistan. He's Malik's roommate.

30:25.517 --> 30:28.035
Problem is Malik has no idea
why Raheem shot Sammy.

30:28.036 --> 30:30.104
You got a location on
the guy? He's in the wind.

30:30.105 --> 30:31.672
But about 15 minutes
after the shooting,

30:31.673 --> 30:33.507
Raheem started making calls
to Farrah Ahmed.

30:33.508 --> 30:35.726
She never answered. She never
returned the calls. All right.

30:35.727 --> 30:37.778
Our people in Pakistan
confirm Farrah's story.

30:37.779 --> 30:39.480
Her father did have a
heart attack last week.

30:39.481 --> 30:42.283
Excuse me.

30:42.284 --> 30:44.318
My people are telling me
that Farrah is landing

30:44.319 --> 30:45.986
at JFK in less than an hour.

30:45.987 --> 30:47.872
All right. I'll get on it.

30:47.873 --> 30:50.791
Danny, knowing who shot
Sammy Khan is not enough.

30:50.792 --> 30:52.526
I need to know why.

30:52.527 --> 30:53.744
Yes, sir.

31:10.255 --> 31:12.506
Excuse me.

31:37.699 --> 31:39.599
There. The girl in the scarf.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.618
Is that her?
Mm-hmm.

31:41.619 --> 31:43.837
Excuse me. Farrah Ahmed?

31:43.838 --> 31:46.373
Who are you? Police.
We need to speak to you.

31:46.374 --> 31:47.808
Come on. Come with us.

31:47.809 --> 31:50.244
Why?! I haven't
done anything.

31:50.245 --> 31:52.079
What is this,
some kind of profiling?

31:52.080 --> 31:53.680
Listen, nobody's
profiling you, okay?

31:53.681 --> 31:55.249
It's about Sammy Khan.
Have a seat.

31:55.250 --> 31:57.751
What about Sammy Khan?

31:57.752 --> 31:59.286
How close were you and Sammy?

31:59.287 --> 32:01.221
Sammy's a good friend.

32:01.222 --> 32:02.956
He always looks out for me.

32:02.957 --> 32:04.324
Why?

32:04.325 --> 32:05.659
What's happened?

32:05.660 --> 32:07.060
He's been shot.

32:07.061 --> 32:09.462
Oh, no.

32:09.463 --> 32:11.098
Is Sammy going to be okay?

32:11.099 --> 32:13.466
Well, he has the world's
best doctors, so...

32:13.467 --> 32:16.303
Listen, I need to ask you
about Raheem Davi.

32:16.304 --> 32:18.822
How long have you
known him? Raheem? Why?

32:21.676 --> 32:24.328
Our-our families are friendly
back in Pakistan.

32:24.329 --> 32:25.779
Come from the same village.

32:25.780 --> 32:27.681
They made plans for us.

32:27.682 --> 32:29.149
They expected you to marry?

32:29.150 --> 32:30.617
In their dreams.

32:30.618 --> 32:33.170
Which is the only place
it'll ever happen.

32:33.171 --> 32:36.290
But Raheem's become obsessed
with the idea

32:36.291 --> 32:38.125
that I'm his property.

32:38.126 --> 32:40.027
He's been calling me nonstop

32:40.028 --> 32:42.162
for the last two days
begging to see me.

32:42.163 --> 32:45.432
I wonder why.

32:45.433 --> 32:47.768
He shoot Sammy, my God.

32:49.003 --> 32:53.974
Look, is there any other reason
why Raheem may have shot Sammy?

32:55.310 --> 32:56.777
Raheem's crazy jealous.

32:56.778 --> 32:58.545
He never liked Sammy.

32:58.546 --> 33:02.649
Even before I met him, so I...
can't say for sure.

33:02.650 --> 33:05.319
Will you help us catch him?
Raheem?

33:19.133 --> 33:21.868
Farrah, you came back.

33:21.869 --> 33:24.004
RAHEEM
I knew you would come.

33:25.173 --> 33:27.207
Did you hear about Sammy?

33:27.208 --> 33:28.592
What about him?

33:28.593 --> 33:29.943
He was shot.

33:29.944 --> 33:32.346
Why would anyone shoot Sammy?

33:32.347 --> 33:34.147
Who shot him is not important.

33:34.148 --> 33:35.449
Maybe it's a good thing.

33:35.450 --> 33:36.950
He's was trying
to come between us.

33:36.951 --> 33:38.602
Now we don't have to
worry about him anymore.

33:38.603 --> 33:39.886
But he's my friend.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.355
He is a
low-class animal

33:41.356 --> 33:43.073
who does not respect tradition.

33:43.074 --> 33:44.825
Forget about him.

33:44.826 --> 33:47.661
Did you shoot Sammy?

33:48.529 --> 33:50.731
Now you can be mine
finally and totally.

33:50.732 --> 33:53.767
No one can come between us,
as our families have ordained.

33:53.768 --> 33:55.902
I'm not going to marry you.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.570
I'm going to love
the man I marry.

33:57.571 --> 33:58.972
That's why I came to America.

34:00.642 --> 34:02.809
Why did you shoot Sammy?!

34:02.810 --> 34:04.344
Why?!

34:04.345 --> 34:05.846
I shot him because of you.

34:05.847 --> 34:08.130
And I will shoot him
1,000 times over and over again.

34:08.132 --> 34:10.350
I'll make a monument
out of his grave.

34:10.351 --> 34:12.185
Hey! Hey!

34:12.186 --> 34:13.353
It's all right.

34:13.353 --> 34:14.621
You got nowhere to go, buddy.

34:14.621 --> 34:17.274
Park is surrounded,
so let the woman go.

34:17.275 --> 34:18.925
Come on!

34:20.478 --> 34:22.362
Call for backup!
Cut him off!

34:24.315 --> 34:26.099
Come here!

34:31.039 --> 34:32.572
Come here!

34:32.572 --> 34:34.440
There you go.
There you go. What?!

34:34.442 --> 34:35.659
Get his arm.
Get his arm!

34:35.659 --> 34:37.110
What did you do it for, huh?

34:37.110 --> 34:38.779
Lousy stinking jealousy!

34:38.780 --> 34:41.947
That's the best news
I've heard in two days.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.284
That's fantastic.
Get him out of here.

34:44.284 --> 34:47.853
Yeah, Commissioner Reagan,
please.

34:47.855 --> 34:49.956
Nice work, Detective.

34:49.956 --> 34:53.060
I got 36 minutes
with nothing to do.

34:53.061 --> 34:54.895
Sammy's cover is still intact.

34:54.896 --> 34:56.228
The operation is a go.

34:56.230 --> 34:57.931
36 minutes.

34:57.932 --> 34:59.933
That's quite a son
you've got there.

35:06.007 --> 35:07.941
What happened?

35:07.942 --> 35:10.911
Well, Detective, you got shot.

35:10.912 --> 35:13.180
So they tell me, sir.

35:13.181 --> 35:14.915
Sorry about that.

35:14.916 --> 35:17.751
We can talk
about what happened later.

35:20.421 --> 35:22.689
I want to stay in the program.

35:22.690 --> 35:26.626
Well, the good news is
your cover is still intact.

35:26.627 --> 35:29.830
Do you remember what you
asked me when I started?

35:29.831 --> 35:32.032
I think so.

35:32.033 --> 35:36.069
I asked if you thought you could
make the sacrifices required,

35:36.070 --> 35:38.572
and you said that, uh,
the same radicals

35:38.573 --> 35:40.173
attacked your family back home.

35:40.174 --> 35:41.475
That's right.

35:41.476 --> 35:44.845
America gave me safe harbor
from that.

35:44.846 --> 35:49.249
America gave me the chance
to fight for what's right.

35:49.250 --> 35:54.020
That is a debt
I have sworn to repay.

35:55.390 --> 35:58.825
You know, Sammy,
when I first became a cop,

35:58.826 --> 36:02.129
the bad guys were pretty easy
to figure out.

36:03.164 --> 36:05.599
They were no less bad, but...

36:05.600 --> 36:07.934
now the threats come
from all over the globe.

36:07.935 --> 36:11.671
I can't win this battle
without men like you.

36:13.541 --> 36:15.642
I'll make a deal with you.

36:15.643 --> 36:18.912
You heal up,
we'll talk about it.

36:20.815 --> 36:22.015
Thank you, sir.

36:22.016 --> 36:25.452
Well, actually, Sammy,

36:25.453 --> 36:27.320
thank you.

36:35.896 --> 36:38.832
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

36:40.234 --> 36:41.768
Time!

36:44.272 --> 36:46.306
Good work, kid.

36:47.959 --> 36:50.677
So I guess this is the part
where I say I'm sorry.

36:50.678 --> 36:52.345
That I was wrong.

36:52.346 --> 36:53.713
You were right.

36:53.714 --> 36:55.682
Oh, it was just some
weird hunch I had that she

36:55.683 --> 36:56.750
was on the level, you know?

36:56.751 --> 36:58.285
Lucky for Melissa,
you stayed with it,

36:58.286 --> 36:59.953
'cause I was no help
to the girl.

36:59.954 --> 37:01.421
So why did the brother do it?

37:01.422 --> 37:03.890
Family cut him out of the will,

37:03.891 --> 37:05.642
so all the money
was going to her.

37:05.643 --> 37:07.527
But if she was
declared incompetent,

37:07.528 --> 37:08.762
he's next of kin,

37:08.763 --> 37:10.197
all the money goes to him.

37:10.198 --> 37:11.931
Ah, the root of all evil.

37:11.932 --> 37:14.034
I'm glad I was born good-looking
instead of rich.

37:15.369 --> 37:17.771
Still, nice work.

37:17.772 --> 37:20.807
I should have known better.

37:20.808 --> 37:23.844
You got something special.

37:23.845 --> 37:25.745
Different kind of,
I don't know, instinct.

37:25.746 --> 37:28.582
You remind me
of your brother Joe.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.000
Thanks, Sarge.

37:30.001 --> 37:31.618
You're welcome.

37:39.811 --> 37:42.012
Hey.
How's it going?

37:44.031 --> 37:45.365
Reagan.

37:45.366 --> 37:47.033
Hey.

37:47.034 --> 37:49.019
Detective Malevsky.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.170
What's going on?

37:50.171 --> 37:52.639
We didn't get a chance
to talk the other day.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.408
Your brother,
Danny... what a hot dog.

37:55.409 --> 37:57.194
Grandstanding that judge.

37:59.163 --> 38:01.681
He's a good detective, though.

38:01.682 --> 38:03.700
So was your brother Joe.

38:03.701 --> 38:06.353
That's what people say.

38:06.354 --> 38:08.855
You know... we worked together,

38:08.856 --> 38:10.724
in the Warrant Squad.

38:11.692 --> 38:14.127
Lydia Gonsalves
worked there, too, but...

38:14.128 --> 38:15.762
you knew that already.

38:18.499 --> 38:22.369
Boy, I bet, with your brother
killed in the line of duty,

38:22.370 --> 38:24.404
your family worries about you.

38:26.374 --> 38:30.076
Just... make sure
you're careful.

38:30.077 --> 38:33.113
It can be dangerous out here.

38:37.685 --> 38:40.020
Nice car.

38:45.293 --> 38:47.961
At 4:00 this afternoon,

38:47.962 --> 38:50.664
detectives from the New York
City Intelligence Division

38:50.665 --> 38:54.034
took into custody
four Pakistani nationals

38:54.035 --> 38:58.572
for allegedly plotting
a bioterrorism attack

38:58.573 --> 39:02.409
against New York City's
water supply system.

39:02.410 --> 39:06.580
I would like to introduce
Deputy Commissioner Soren,

39:06.581 --> 39:08.582
head of NYPD Intelligence,

39:08.583 --> 39:11.318
to brief you on the details
of this operation.

39:11.319 --> 39:12.752
Good afternoon.

39:12.753 --> 39:16.056
Uh, first I would like to stress
that this was a serious threat

39:16.057 --> 39:18.158
made by a sophisticated cell

39:18.159 --> 39:21.628
whose members were hell-bent

39:21.629 --> 39:25.065
on seeing the realization
of their plan,

39:25.066 --> 39:26.800
and that if executed...

39:26.801 --> 39:29.536
You know, I think
Sammy was a cop.

39:29.537 --> 39:31.338
What makes you say that?

39:33.907 --> 39:36.075
You think I'm a
lousy detective?

39:36.076 --> 39:39.579
What kind of question is that?

39:39.580 --> 39:43.783
Well... when I mentioned
9/11, you didn't react.

39:43.784 --> 39:48.588
And then you tell me to get out
of the Malik interrogation.

39:48.589 --> 39:51.858
And, uh, what really
tipped it off is

39:51.859 --> 39:54.494
you stopped talking to me...

39:54.495 --> 39:57.197
like my stupid
ex-husband used to do.

40:01.302 --> 40:04.304
You know, you can
trust me, Danny,

40:04.305 --> 40:05.505
with anything.

40:05.506 --> 40:06.740
I already know that.

40:06.741 --> 40:09.376
Do you?
Yeah.

40:09.377 --> 40:12.045
'Cause I think
you're a great detective.

40:12.046 --> 40:15.815
...city, state,
this great country.

40:15.816 --> 40:17.951
Now I'd like to turn
the microphone back

40:17.952 --> 40:20.120
to Commissioner Reagan.

40:20.121 --> 40:22.622
Here in New York
City, we have learned,

40:22.623 --> 40:25.492
firsthand...

40:25.493 --> 40:28.595
that our enemies
will stop at nothing

40:28.596 --> 40:30.830
to inflict harm upon us.

40:30.831 --> 40:35.735
And for those who would assail
this great metropolis,

40:35.736 --> 40:37.971
hear this:

40:37.972 --> 40:42.375
Our fight against you
will respect no clock,

40:42.376 --> 40:45.779
no calendar, no boundary.

40:45.780 --> 40:49.549
In short,
we will stop at nothing

40:49.550 --> 40:52.485
to hunt you down
and bring you to justice.
