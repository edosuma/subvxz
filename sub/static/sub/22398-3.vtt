00:01.000 --> 00:02.525
I am Robert Catesby.

00:02.560 --> 00:04.050
My purpose is to kill
the King of England.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.048
TOM: We mean to lead
the Catholics of England

00:06.080 --> 00:06.967
out of their oppression.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.764
We will seize Princess Elizabeth

00:08.800 --> 00:10.450
we will place the child
upon the throne.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.164
Northumberland shall
be Lord Protector.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.565
ROBERT: You will all have
heard of Father Gerard.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.601
He now stands with us.

CONSTABLE:
My master is the protector

00:18.360 --> 00:19.850
of the Catholics of England.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.201
Spain and England have
need of this treaty.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.525
ROBERT: You have so much
of your mother in you.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.370
The King, his councillors
and his Parliament

00:28.400 --> 00:30.767
I will blow them all to Hell!
- Enough!

There must be 4,000 pounds
of powder here.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.561
6,000. I doubt there'd
be a firkin of powder

03:19.600 --> 03:20.965
left anywhere in London.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.967
Two hundredweight?

03:23.040 --> 03:24.246
Aye.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.806
Well done.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.841
Laid on top of the powder.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.564
The nails will fly like a whirlwind
through the air.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.604
We've laid our plan.
We must see it through.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.400
Go.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.409

04:44.720 --> 04:47.041
Will you take your refreshment?
- Ah.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.729
Wine from Galicia.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.842
It is the best.
- Ah.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.364
Then let us not delay.

<i>Salud.</i>

05:09.240 --> 05:10.651
Oh.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.964
This is very good.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.684
This is very, very good.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.360
Mm.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.128
Father, I hear rumours of a
multitude of plots and schemes.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.764
The misguided men behind them

05:26.800 --> 05:29.531
put the future of the
Holy Church in England at stake

05:29.560 --> 05:31.483
though it is not their intention.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.521
Cecil and his heretic fanatics

05:34.560 --> 05:38.246
will use these plots to fall
like wolves upon the lamb.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.729
The words you speak
would be my own, sir.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.046
You counselled against
their proposed course?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.206
I did.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.250
Catesby and Wintour...

05:51.800 --> 05:55.805
They visited me in Spain
to ask for our assistance.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.883
Their hearts are set
on revenge

06:02.120 --> 06:04.487
and they will not be moved otherwise.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.322
Can you help us, Father?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.760
Can you tell us what
Catesby intends?

06:18.880 --> 06:20.370
He confesses to you.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.884
If Catesby and his friends
are not stopped

06:24.920 --> 06:28.129
Cecil will arrest innocent Catholics
all over the land.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.802
He will tear them limb from limb.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.447
You alone have the power
to save thousands of innocents

06:35.480 --> 06:38.051
from such a terrible
and dreadful end.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.246
I cannot speak of what
I was told in the confessional.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.760
Do you know to
whom you speak, sir?

06:46.040 --> 06:48.407
This is Don Juan Fernandez
de Velasco.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.205
Duke of Frias,
Constable of Castille.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.730
You owe him obedience.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.411
I owe obedience
to a higher Lord, sir.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.730
I believe you are sincere
and want nothing more

07:01.760 --> 07:03.649
than to avoid further bloodshed.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.047
I do.
With all my heart and soul.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.043
Can you help us, Father?

07:11.080 --> 07:13.811
Is there someone to whom
you can direct us?

07:46.440 --> 07:47.805
FAWKES EXHALES SHARPLY

08:01.120 --> 08:03.327
By your speech
you are from Yorkshire.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.250
I'm from Stonegate in York.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.166
Your father?
- A notary.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.327
Does he still live?

08:14.640 --> 08:15.641
Dead.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.320
Your mother?
- She married another.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.003
And, you, do you have a wife?
- You would interrogate me?

08:25.040 --> 08:26.485
I would know you.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.842
There is nothing you need to know

08:31.880 --> 08:33.563
except I'm a soldier.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.006
When the time comes

08:36.039 --> 08:38.441
when those who have wronged us
have assembled above

08:38.480 --> 08:41.370
I will light the fuse and
I will see them blown to Hell.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.966
FAWKES:
Her name was Maria.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.441
My wife.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.240
'Was'?

09:09.120 --> 09:10.360
Is she dead?

09:18.120 --> 09:19.963
She's dead. To me.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.290
ROBERT:
You have everything?

09:32.320 --> 09:33.685
Once I've lit the match

09:33.720 --> 09:36.485
I'll ride to Dover for the arrival
of Stanley's army

09:36.520 --> 09:38.284
and I'll join them for
the rebellion.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.445
To time the fuse.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.409
All that is left for me

09:57.840 --> 09:59.524
is to say farewell.

10:02.920 --> 10:03.887
Farewell.

Robin.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.727
Gerard?
- Safe.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.411
He left for the coast
and he is in hiding there

10:52.440 --> 10:54.090
awaiting passage to France.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.726
And Garnet?
- Also safe.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.488
I would make peace
with you, cousin.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.090
I will not lose you, Robin.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.770
Oh, I am not lost.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.127
I do God's work now.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.764
For the first time in my life

11:13.800 --> 11:17.600
my purpose is clear
and my heart is full for it.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.171
I think you love me, cousin.
- You know that I do.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.645
Grant me a promise, then.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.647
Should I fall or we fail
in our endeavour

11:29.680 --> 11:30.602
protect my son.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.446
Cecil will try to take the boy
and make him his ward

11:34.480 --> 11:36.801
so he may have possession
of my house and lands.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.882
Do not suffer this to happen.
I beg you.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.722
When I can longer safeguard my son

11:43.760 --> 11:44.921
take him to your care.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.644
You may safeguard him yourself.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.725
Take him and fly from the Kingdom.

11:48.760 --> 11:49.921
You know that I cannot.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.127
What you intend is murder.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.282
There is no other name for it.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.526
Counsel me not.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.367
All I ask is a promise.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.205
Protect my boy.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.329
The path you tread is right
well-worn.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.569
It leads to a bitter
and lonely end.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.890
Turn back, Robin.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.764
It is not too late.

Farewell, cousin.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.083
Farewell, little cousin.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.651
Father Gerard! Wait!

13:11.680 --> 13:13.284
Please, I am a friend

13:13.320 --> 13:16.767
and servant of His Excellency
the Constable of Castille.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.330
What do you want from me?

13:22.360 --> 13:25.887
Father, I seek urgent conference

13:27.200 --> 13:28.645
with Robert Catesby.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.049
I do not know that name.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.004
Father, my instructions
are to seek out

13:34.040 --> 13:36.042
Master Catesby and his friends

13:36.080 --> 13:39.243
and lend them whatever
assistance they may need

13:39.600 --> 13:41.602
in their design against the King.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.167
God be praised.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.282
I do not know where he hides.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.050
He is a hunted man.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.130
Do you at least know how
he intends to strike this blow?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.884
They will strike at the opening
of Parliament.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.283
And the method...?

14:09.360 --> 14:10.646
Gunpowder.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.651
You are all men of honour and piety.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.886
I am proud to stand with you.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.601
In two days, this tyrant King
and his Lords

14:23.640 --> 14:25.529
will be buried under the rubble
of the Parliament.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.130
Stanley will invade with his army

14:28.160 --> 14:29.525
and across the land

14:29.560 --> 14:31.847
our followers will rise
to overthrow the heretics.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.128
True Religion shall reign once more.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.961
Our business now lies
to the north.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.962
Torn, keep you here awhile
to see the blow is struck

14:44.000 --> 14:45.843
and when Fawkes'
work is done

14:45.880 --> 14:47.962
ride hard and bring us
news of it.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.010
God bless us all.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.246
Farewell, Tom.

Godspeed, Thomas.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.008
I'll see you on the morrow, coz.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.329
At the dawning of a new day.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.290
Your Parliament opens in two days,
does it not?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.360
It does.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.765
The King will be present?

15:58.600 --> 15:59.681
He will.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.811
And the Queen?
- Yes, and the Prince, too.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.964
But not the Princess Elizabeth?

16:05.520 --> 16:07.966
No, she is in the country
for her schooling.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.802
Then the Princess will survive.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.888
They mean to murder you all
at the opening of the Parliament.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.285
We will save the King's life

16:21.320 --> 16:23.687
by this generous intelligence,
My Lord.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.368
I am most grateful, Your Excellency

16:29.400 --> 16:31.368
and rest assured
this generosity

16:31.400 --> 16:33.004
will be met with the like liberality

16:33.040 --> 16:35.202
when the articles of the treaty
are settled.

at dawn on the 5th.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.526
How many?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.847
Hundreds have sworn
allegiance to our cause.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.767
There is more.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.369
And this is just a fraction of
the muskets we've been promised.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.162
I will speak with my friends
in the Lower House

17:49.200 --> 17:51.965
and urge them to vote
for the proposal.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.809
Well, this is most excellent news

17:53.840 --> 17:55.444
My Lord Monteagle.
- KNOCK ON DOOR

My Lord, I was charged
to see that Your Lordship

18:00.360 --> 18:01.850
receive this letter.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.364
Charged? By whom?
- A stranger, My Lord.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.561
I did not know him.

Oh, it'll be some tedious
matter of business or law.

I detained you from your affairs.

of this time

19:10.360 --> 19:13.603
and think not slightly of
this advertisement

19:13.640 --> 19:15.404
but retire yourself into
your country

19:15.440 --> 19:18.011

the event in safety.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.807
you needs much show this

CECIL: It is most likely written
by a madman or a fool.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.042
Nevertheless, I thought it
the safest course

19:54.080 --> 19:55.809
to bring it to Your Majesty's
attention

19:55.840 --> 19:59.401
since I was unable
to decipher its meaning

19:59.440 --> 20:01.807

of interpretation
