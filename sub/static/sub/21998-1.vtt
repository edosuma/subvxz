00:01.914 --> 00:03.640
Beth, I want to adopt a baby.

00:04.594 --> 00:06.967
I realize I didn't come
to New York to be in a hit play.

00:06.992 --> 00:09.131
I came to New York to win back my girl.

00:09.586 --> 00:11.753
Hello. Hey, Kevin, it's Ron Howard.

00:11.788 --> 00:14.122
I'm prepping a movie right now
that I'm gonna direct.

00:14.157 --> 00:15.624
It shoots in Los Angeles.

00:15.658 --> 00:17.281
You would be perfect.

00:17.781 --> 00:18.858
I know what I want to do.

00:18.882 --> 00:20.687
- I want to sing.
- Hmm.

00:20.884 --> 00:23.414
- Whoa! What the hell was that?
- Sorry.

00:23.439 --> 00:25.098
Don't punish her because
I crossed the line.

00:25.122 --> 00:26.831
- Hey, Bec?
- What'd you say?

00:27.624 --> 00:30.059
Hey, hey, come on. Come on.

00:30.094 --> 00:31.265
Jack!

00:31.854 --> 00:34.546
I think you should go stay
with Miguel for a while.

Things not said, advice not given,

00:49.161 --> 00:53.664
envelopes unstamped,
regrets enveloping me.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.218
Is it easier there? I wonder.

01:02.781 --> 01:05.851
I ponder, I guess... Yes.

01:07.156 --> 01:09.046
I guess, yes.

01:18.132 --> 01:19.601
What's Mom doing back?

01:23.820 --> 01:26.578
Do you think of
me as I do of you, my son?

01:27.429 --> 01:28.500
My son.

01:29.171 --> 01:30.703
My... son.

01:30.728 --> 01:32.273
You're a cutie, aren't you?

01:32.297 --> 01:34.732
Oh, you're the cutest baby
in the world.

01:34.757 --> 01:37.935
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.138
Oh, my goodness.

01:39.162 --> 01:40.696
- Randall?
- Yes.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.310
We've really got to get
our day going, Randall.

01:43.335 --> 01:44.876
Oh, of course. Sorry.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.593
No. All this talk about adoption
is giving me baby fever, right?

01:47.837 --> 01:49.871
♪ I got baby fever ♪

01:49.906 --> 01:51.573
♪ He got baby fever... ♪

01:51.742 --> 01:53.320
Okay, that's gonna have
to do it for today, buddy.

01:53.344 --> 01:55.145
Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

01:55.984 --> 01:57.195
Happy birthday, Randall.

01:57.220 --> 01:59.335
Thanks, guys.
It's gonna be a great year.

01:59.675 --> 02:02.276
The things you'll do, I'll never know.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.835
The pain.

02:04.986 --> 02:06.000
The secrets.

02:09.693 --> 02:10.991
Mom, where's Dad?

02:11.017 --> 02:12.884
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

02:13.117 --> 02:15.270
Everything's fine. We're gonna sit down

02:15.295 --> 02:17.164
and explain everything to you guys.

02:17.189 --> 02:19.190
Oh, to be given a chance,

02:19.723 --> 02:21.968
a start, the restart,

02:22.193 --> 02:23.585
the fresh start.

02:24.261 --> 02:26.898
The crowd goes wild!

02:27.234 --> 02:30.546
You are gonna crush
this audition, babe.

02:30.571 --> 02:33.187
- You're gonna crush it.
- Oh, you think?

02:33.212 --> 02:34.976
Oh, man. All right.

02:38.164 --> 02:39.250
That is so sweet.

02:39.275 --> 02:40.441
Happy birthday to you.

02:40.496 --> 02:41.242
Oh...

02:41.267 --> 02:42.434
You ready?

02:42.510 --> 02:44.203
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

02:47.919 --> 02:48.881
Aah!

02:48.906 --> 02:50.708
- Ow, ow, ow, no, no.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

02:50.732 --> 02:53.100
Will love come for
you, as it did for me?

02:53.411 --> 02:55.507
Find you, wreck you,

02:55.546 --> 02:58.181
save you, change you?

02:58.208 --> 03:00.320
Sophie got carried away.

03:00.610 --> 03:01.914
Baby, I love you,

03:02.612 --> 03:04.976
and I wanted to bring you
to the perfect place

03:05.001 --> 03:06.640
and I wanted to say the perfect thing.

03:08.346 --> 03:09.835
But I can't say the perfect thing

03:09.860 --> 03:11.398
because you are the perfect thing.

03:12.462 --> 03:14.882
So... what do you say?

03:16.361 --> 03:17.595
Will you marry me?

03:19.594 --> 03:20.861
And cut.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.484
Very nice, very nice, Kevin.

03:22.518 --> 03:24.419
I could feel the tennis ball welling up.

03:24.453 --> 03:26.490
Really? So, when we film Emma's side,

03:26.538 --> 03:28.593
we just... plop her
down in there like that?

03:28.617 --> 03:31.179
Well, it's a little more complex
than just plopping,

03:31.204 --> 03:32.704
but, uh, yeah.

03:32.729 --> 03:34.897
Huh, I mean, technology, huh?
It's crazy.

03:35.314 --> 03:38.375
Yeah, it is, and you know what
else is kind of crazy, Kevin?

03:39.846 --> 03:42.648
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

03:43.432 --> 03:45.099
And if life breaks for you

03:45.134 --> 03:46.937
the way it would not break for me,

03:46.962 --> 03:49.578
if love hunts you,
finds you, captures you,

03:49.847 --> 03:51.398
will you hold it tight...

03:52.328 --> 03:54.820
nurture it, protect it?

03:55.837 --> 03:56.992
Let's go. Come on.

03:57.413 --> 03:58.703
I hope you will.

03:59.199 --> 04:00.281
I hope you can.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.835
What the hell is going on?

04:04.109 --> 04:06.343
This father's advice is not required,

04:06.378 --> 04:07.578
it has no call,

04:08.304 --> 04:10.648
so instead I'll share some
from another.

04:10.725 --> 04:12.375
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

04:13.024 --> 04:14.891
It's better to have loved and lost

04:15.387 --> 04:17.296
than to never have loved at all.

04:23.419 --> 04:25.132
Your mom and I want to talk to you.

04:39.164 --> 04:40.507
Uh, your father and I thought

04:40.532 --> 04:42.468
that it was important to
be honest with you guys

04:42.493 --> 04:43.882
about what's going on.

04:45.256 --> 04:47.781
Ben... from the band,

04:47.806 --> 04:49.437
was pretty inappropriate,

04:49.462 --> 04:51.546
and your father came to surprise me,

04:51.571 --> 04:53.505
and he got upset,

04:54.133 --> 04:56.226
and I left the tour.

04:56.620 --> 04:58.328
We had a pretty difficult night.

04:59.896 --> 05:03.265
And now we're just
taking a moment to...

05:04.410 --> 05:06.406
- catch our breath.
- Yeah.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.875
- Catch your breath.
- Yes.

05:10.982 --> 05:12.257
What does that mean?

05:13.601 --> 05:14.875
Are you getting a divorce?

05:14.900 --> 05:16.148
- No, no, no.
- Of course not.

05:16.173 --> 05:17.422
- We...
- No, no, we're just taking

05:17.446 --> 05:19.181
- a couple of days for ourselves.
- Yeah.

05:19.477 --> 05:21.523
- I'm gonna go stay at Miguel's house.
- Yes.

05:21.548 --> 05:22.649
Okay?

05:22.964 --> 05:25.906
- Well, I'll go with Dad.
- Kate, stop.

05:26.104 --> 05:27.375
- But, Dad...
- Stop.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.429
- Well, this is...
- No, this is insane!

05:29.454 --> 05:31.250
- Bug...
- No. Are you...

05:35.638 --> 05:36.679
Go ahead.

05:42.274 --> 05:44.507
Would you give your mom
and I a sec, buddy?

05:46.203 --> 05:47.609
"Buddy."

05:59.566 --> 06:00.906
They're gonna be fine.

06:07.781 --> 06:08.921
We'll be fine.

06:10.159 --> 06:13.101
- Bec...
- Mm-mm. No, not yet.

06:18.527 --> 06:20.617
I need to stop feeling so...

06:22.623 --> 06:23.882
disappointed.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.421
I need to feel something else first.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.554
But we'll talk soon.

06:42.258 --> 06:45.906
And some freshly squeezed
orange juice, and voilà.

06:45.931 --> 06:47.098
Eat up, monsters.

06:47.123 --> 06:48.468
- Daddy?
- Yeah, baby?

06:48.493 --> 06:49.867
Happy birthday!

06:49.892 --> 06:51.218
Happy birthday!

06:51.243 --> 06:53.578
- Hey-yo!
- Thank you, girls.

06:55.189 --> 06:56.523
- Daddy?
- Yeah, baby?

06:56.548 --> 06:58.516
How come Mommy goes to work now,

06:58.541 --> 07:01.076
and you stay home and are the girl?

07:01.297 --> 07:02.592
Annie, who...

07:03.960 --> 07:05.553
It is incredibly old-fashioned

07:05.578 --> 07:07.117
and upsetting that you just said that.

07:07.142 --> 07:09.073
It is perfectly normal
for a mommy to go to work

07:09.098 --> 07:10.165
and a daddy to stay at home.

07:10.189 --> 07:12.557
Women can do anything.
Look at Hillary Clinton.

07:12.582 --> 07:13.582
Hmm?

07:13.911 --> 07:15.039
She lost.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.561
Yeah, but she almost won.

07:16.595 --> 07:17.896
Just eat your breakfast.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.531
Mmm. Smells good.

07:19.556 --> 07:21.089
They're eating.

07:21.114 --> 07:23.257
Who, Stacey Dash
and Omarosa over there?

07:23.789 --> 07:25.562
Yeah, they're chowing down.

07:25.648 --> 07:27.257
- It good?
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.282 --> 07:28.382
Thank you.

07:30.676 --> 07:32.320
You ready for this afternoon?

07:33.014 --> 07:34.014
Yep.

07:34.937 --> 07:37.492
It's gonna be the best
birthday gift ever.

07:37.773 --> 07:38.773
- Mm-hmm.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.212
- I'm gonna go take a shower.
- Okay.

07:50.162 --> 07:52.031
- Hey.
- Babe, hey.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.420
You're not on a plane.

07:53.445 --> 07:54.469
Why are you not on a plane?

07:54.493 --> 07:56.127
It's-it's my mom.

07:56.898 --> 07:58.273
She had a really bad morning,

07:58.298 --> 07:59.835
and I just, I couldn't leave her.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.125
Of course not. No.

08:01.150 --> 08:02.868
How about now, though?
She good? She good now?

08:02.892 --> 08:04.742
She has MS, Kevin.
She's never good.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.609
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

08:07.634 --> 08:08.634
I'm just...

08:09.183 --> 08:11.601
I'm tired and I'm sad,

08:11.709 --> 08:13.578
and I'm gonna miss your birthday.

08:13.641 --> 08:15.015
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.441
I wanted to be with you.

08:16.879 --> 08:18.646
I wanted to be in L.A.,

08:18.899 --> 08:20.734
and I wanted to see Kardashians.

08:20.759 --> 08:21.721
Well, I was gonna take you to the

08:21.733 --> 08:22.883
place where they get their smoothies.

08:22.907 --> 08:24.908
Oh, stop. You're killing me.

08:26.899 --> 08:28.085
Did I ruin your birthday?

08:28.110 --> 08:29.484
No, of course not.
It's not ruined.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.882
The crew got me this cake.

08:31.273 --> 08:33.256
A cake with my face on it.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.820
Kind of cool.

08:35.169 --> 08:36.756
Well, I should get back to her.

08:38.195 --> 08:39.484
I'm so sorry, Kevin.

08:39.509 --> 08:41.448
Well, listen, the Kardashians
aren't going anywhere.

08:41.472 --> 08:43.648
- Promise?
- I promise. They're like gremlins.

08:43.673 --> 08:45.913
By next week, there'll be,
like, a bazillion more of 'em.

08:46.775 --> 08:47.775
Okay.

08:48.513 --> 08:49.601
I love you.

08:49.674 --> 08:50.726
I love you.

08:56.051 --> 08:58.104
Yeah, I... yeah, I c... I can't.

08:58.173 --> 08:59.992
- Ready.
- Okay.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.734
If you don't think this looks good,

09:01.759 --> 09:02.953
you have to tell me.

09:02.978 --> 09:05.656
Now, the perfect situation
for any man to be in.

09:06.223 --> 09:07.593
Okay, you can look.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.695
Schwing.

09:11.076 --> 09:12.242
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:12.267 --> 09:14.265
They might not even ask you to sing.

09:14.290 --> 09:15.429
I'm serious.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.578
If that outfit has
anything to say about it,

09:17.603 --> 09:21.273
you are absolutely going to be
the new lead female singer

09:21.298 --> 09:23.750
of Yelp's 17th best
reviewed wedding band

09:23.775 --> 09:24.976
in Southern California.

09:25.001 --> 09:28.210
- Well, I am down two sizes.
- I know. And it shows.

09:29.292 --> 09:30.695
You think you're so cute.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.164
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And you are.

09:32.189 --> 09:34.695
You actually look like
a young Bruce Willis.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.859
Don't do that.

09:35.964 --> 09:38.132
You cannot tell a man
who went bald at 25

09:38.157 --> 09:39.657
that he looks like a
young Bruce Willis.

09:39.681 --> 09:41.156
- It's too much.
- No.

09:41.828 --> 09:44.968
Do you know what the...
sexiest thing about you is?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.093
Yeah, my calves.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.118
- Mm-mm.
- Oh.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.093
The sexiest thing about you

09:49.219 --> 09:51.687
is how sexy you make me feel.

09:51.712 --> 09:52.912
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I see.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.179
Oh.

09:54.204 --> 09:55.968
- Kate?
- Oh, no!

09:56.593 --> 09:59.570
- Hey.
- Hey. Birthday girl.

09:59.984 --> 10:01.883
Birthday boy. Where's Sophie?

10:01.917 --> 10:02.984
Canceled. Mom.

10:03.018 --> 10:03.851
- M.S.?
- Yeah.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.687
- You? Want to talk?
- Disappointed. No.

10:05.721 --> 10:06.750
Happy birthday.

10:06.775 --> 10:08.992
I love it when you guys
talk twin in front of me.

10:09.017 --> 10:10.000
Hey, Kevbo.

10:10.025 --> 10:11.659
- Yep?
- Since Sophie is bailing,

10:11.684 --> 10:13.384
does that mean... that we're gonna have

10:13.409 --> 10:14.960
to cancel the double date tonight?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.046
No.

10:19.071 --> 10:21.040
- You... It's still our birthdays, Toby.
- It's still our birthday.

10:21.064 --> 10:22.398
My God, give me a break.

10:22.423 --> 10:23.876
By the way, you're
gonna love this place.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.512
It's, like, the number
one joint in town, okay?

10:25.536 --> 10:27.868
I had to pull strings like frickin'
Geppetto just to get in there.

10:27.892 --> 10:29.602
- That's a Pinocchio reference.
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:29.626 --> 10:30.860
Geppetto was a woodworker.

10:32.296 --> 10:33.679
Wasn't a...
Never mind.

10:34.632 --> 10:35.593
Let's take a look

10:35.618 --> 10:37.719
- at the outfit. I want to see.
- Yes. What do you think?

10:37.743 --> 10:38.717
- It's great. I mean, you look...
- Yeah?

10:38.742 --> 10:39.654
Yeah, you're beautiful.

10:39.679 --> 10:41.984
The only thing is, are
you trying too hard?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.204
- It's just a question I had.
- No.

10:43.228 --> 10:44.773
I don't know. You don't want to be

10:44.798 --> 10:45.876
the girl in the room
that's trying too hard.

10:45.900 --> 10:48.369
- Yeah.
- Uh, we like the outfit, so...

10:48.937 --> 10:50.328
Okay, I have a backup.

10:50.353 --> 10:52.721
- What? I wanted... I wanted...
- Come help me, please.

10:52.746 --> 10:54.188
I'll be right back. Gonna
help her with this real quick.

10:54.212 --> 10:57.320
So glad I gave you that extra key
in case of emergencies, Kev.

10:57.561 --> 10:59.696
The key was for emergencies!

11:02.961 --> 11:05.820
And the she says she's too
disappointed to talk.

11:06.048 --> 11:08.375
She says, "Soon.
We'll talk soon."

11:08.400 --> 11:09.734
And then she just...

11:11.414 --> 11:12.539
leaves.

11:13.419 --> 11:14.500
Oof.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.500
"Oof."

11:18.187 --> 11:19.148
That's what I get?

11:19.173 --> 11:20.876
You're supposed to be
a guy who says things,

11:20.900 --> 11:22.321
and-and I get "Oof."

11:25.551 --> 11:26.921
You make each other better.

11:28.577 --> 11:29.835
You're gonna be fine.

11:30.789 --> 11:32.031
Yeah, she's gonna call.

11:32.255 --> 11:33.789
- 'Course.
- Today.

11:33.814 --> 11:36.282
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that phone is gonna ring,

11:36.441 --> 11:38.882
and I'm gonna be home before tonight.

11:39.023 --> 11:41.953
We've got some things
to work on, yeah, sure,

11:41.978 --> 11:44.335
of course, but... it's okay.

11:44.534 --> 11:45.992
Hey, no sheets.

11:46.742 --> 11:48.773
Look... sheets are for long-term guests.

11:48.798 --> 11:50.165
I'm not a long-term guest.

11:51.147 --> 11:52.226
Okay.

11:53.065 --> 11:55.101
Hey, look, I'm gonna
pop into the office,

11:55.166 --> 11:56.468
get a jump on the week.

11:56.493 --> 11:57.585
Why don't you come?

11:57.610 --> 11:58.914
It'll take your mind off things.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.687
Nah, I just want to be alone.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.726
- Okay.
- Yeah.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.429
It's all yours, man.

12:08.345 --> 12:09.890
Hey. Thanks.

12:10.215 --> 12:11.421
For saying the thing.

12:13.486 --> 12:14.789
Sorry about the "Oof."

12:17.766 --> 12:19.023
She's gonna call.

12:39.679 --> 12:42.804
So... how was the party? Hmmm?

12:54.813 --> 12:56.656
What the hell?

12:56.681 --> 12:58.359
- We're gonna go to the movies.
- I don't want to...

12:58.383 --> 12:59.726
We're gonna go to the movies.

12:59.751 --> 13:01.687
We're gonna go see
the one with Tom Hanks

13:01.712 --> 13:03.379
at the dollar theater,
and we're gonna...

13:03.404 --> 13:05.758
give ourselves over to Tom Hanks
and he's gonna make us feel

13:05.782 --> 13:08.351
so much better about the
mind-blowingly upsetting crap

13:08.376 --> 13:09.554
that's going on in our heads.

13:09.579 --> 13:10.992
Yeah? Great.

13:11.017 --> 13:12.226
It's gonna be fun.

13:13.113 --> 13:15.851
Now, obviously, what
makes private adoption unique

13:15.876 --> 13:18.328
is that you are paired
with an expectant mother

13:18.353 --> 13:19.539
who has already committed

13:19.564 --> 13:21.704
- to put her newborn up for adoption.
- That's perfect.

13:21.728 --> 13:23.929
I was a newborn myself
when my parents found me.

13:23.954 --> 13:25.304
It's perfect. Right?

13:27.281 --> 13:29.125
It's common in these situations

13:29.150 --> 13:32.359
for one spouse to be the dragger
and one to be the drag-ee.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.153
It's important to communicate,

13:34.178 --> 13:35.515
because... fair warning...

13:35.540 --> 13:37.508
this process will really
get up in your business.

13:37.533 --> 13:38.766
"Get up in there."

13:39.333 --> 13:40.539
That's what she said.

13:40.782 --> 13:43.164
- Uh...
- Fingerprints, background checks.

13:43.297 --> 13:44.950
We'll be interviewing
both your daughters

13:44.975 --> 13:46.290
to get a sense of their feelings.

13:46.314 --> 13:47.700
We haven't told the girls yet,

13:47.725 --> 13:48.867
but they're gonna love it.

13:48.916 --> 13:50.789
- A little brother...
- Or little sister.

13:50.814 --> 13:53.328
Or brother. Hey, is that
something we can request?

13:53.440 --> 13:55.296
I mean, I love me some
headstrong sisters,

13:55.321 --> 13:57.646
but they run pretty deep in my
house, if you know what I'm saying.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.771
He wants a boy.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.367
He wants to adopt a little boy,

14:00.392 --> 14:02.296
because he was a little boy
when he was adopted.

14:02.321 --> 14:04.632
Yeah. I mean, I guess that's part of it.

14:04.657 --> 14:06.757
He wants to honor
his two fathers by replicating

14:06.782 --> 14:08.773
the exact same situation he had.

14:08.798 --> 14:10.235
Well, I don't know if I
would put it that...

14:10.259 --> 14:11.868
Hey, Mary, let me ask you.
You have any kids

14:11.892 --> 14:13.757
laying around that were
left at a fire station?

14:13.943 --> 14:16.265
'Cause that might really
scratch my husband's itch.

14:27.581 --> 14:30.515
Well, as you can see, we're not
afraid of honest, open communication.

14:34.554 --> 14:35.859
Are you fake smoking?

14:38.929 --> 14:39.976
Yes.

14:52.995 --> 14:54.351
Do you not want to adopt?

14:55.081 --> 14:56.953
- Does it matter what I want?
- Hey.

14:57.734 --> 15:00.164
We only ever talk
about what you want, Randall.

15:00.810 --> 15:02.242
You want to adopt.

15:02.296 --> 15:04.062
You want to honor your fathers.

15:04.632 --> 15:06.593
I know this has been
a weird year for you,

15:06.618 --> 15:08.385
and I am trying to be supportive,

15:08.410 --> 15:10.744
but this is becoming, like...

15:10.769 --> 15:12.195
a weird pattern.

15:12.220 --> 15:13.375
Okay, I hear you.

15:13.744 --> 15:15.476
We're partners, in everything.

15:16.337 --> 15:18.578
But 37 years ago, my parents chose me,

15:18.958 --> 15:20.734
and that's why I'm here
with you right now.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.273
This isn't going away for me, Beth.

15:24.717 --> 15:26.328
You need to get your head around it.

15:33.406 --> 15:34.992
Hey... Beth.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.656
No. I'm not throwing down with
you in an adoption parking lot.

15:38.914 --> 15:40.445
- Can we just go...
- Uh-huh.

15:59.423 --> 16:01.180
All right, guys, there's a lot of you.

16:01.204 --> 16:02.726
We're gonna be here into the night.

16:02.852 --> 16:04.601
It may seem like overkill, but this is

16:04.626 --> 16:05.765
a big opportunity.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.968
Make sure you sign the
sheet, and we'll call you.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.455
Make it quick

16:09.479 --> 16:11.734
and make it count.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.352
I have no life.

16:55.376 --> 16:57.719
- I am a freakin' ghost!
- Oh, you know? That is...

16:57.744 --> 16:59.843
- No, no, no, no.
- Admit to me

16:59.868 --> 17:01.210
that you hated the fact that

17:01.235 --> 17:02.921
I had something happening for myself.

17:02.946 --> 17:06.108
I hated that you lied about
working with your ex-boyfriend.

17:06.133 --> 17:07.842
No, that's total BS, Jack.
You hated the fact

17:07.866 --> 17:09.678
- that I was singing again.
- I was fine with it!

17:09.702 --> 17:11.461
- No, you didn't want me to
have a career. - Career?

17:11.484 --> 17:14.061
You are a 40-year-old woman
singing covers in pubs!

17:14.119 --> 17:15.897
That is not a career, Rebecca!

17:15.923 --> 17:17.101
That is ridiculous!

17:21.968 --> 17:24.069
- Want some?
- Sure.

17:25.529 --> 17:26.617
Thank you.

17:29.801 --> 17:32.203
I think Randall's finally
gonna make his move.

17:35.661 --> 17:36.661
What's wrong?

17:37.915 --> 17:39.171
Are you kidding me?

17:39.953 --> 17:40.944
Mmm.

17:40.969 --> 17:41.960
Could I have some, too?

17:41.985 --> 17:42.951
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

17:42.976 --> 17:44.890
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mommy.

17:45.029 --> 17:46.859
Ooh. Happy birthday.

17:46.915 --> 17:48.215
- Right there.
- Mmm.

17:51.298 --> 17:53.226
Beth's struggling with the adoption.

17:53.686 --> 17:55.289
I thought that she was on board.

17:55.314 --> 17:57.437
- Yeah, I did, too.
- Oh.

17:58.402 --> 18:00.031
How did you guys decide?

18:00.587 --> 18:01.587
With me.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.507
There was nothing to decide...
the moment we saw you...

18:05.532 --> 18:06.445
You knew.

18:06.527 --> 18:07.898
That's a hell of a story, Ma.

18:07.923 --> 18:09.000
One of my favorites.

18:14.090 --> 18:16.640
I know you guys didn't have
a perfect marriage.

18:17.070 --> 18:20.476
You'd just lost a child,
and you both just wanted me?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.421
Right away? Just like that?

18:26.619 --> 18:27.984
It's complicated.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.445
That's something people say
when they don't want to tell the truth.

18:56.349 --> 18:58.476
That little guy, right there.

19:02.186 --> 19:03.585
He wound up here.

19:05.399 --> 19:08.434
Exact same place, exact same day.

19:11.502 --> 19:13.789
Just... look at him, Bec.

19:14.683 --> 19:17.515
Placed right there, right next to ours.

19:20.022 --> 19:21.507
Can't you just feel it?

19:23.449 --> 19:25.726
You know, can't you just... see it?

19:28.339 --> 19:29.640
I said no.

19:30.974 --> 19:33.984
But your father was so sure.

19:34.009 --> 19:36.203
I was tired and I was grievin,

19:37.059 --> 19:38.632
and he just kept pushing me.

19:40.211 --> 19:43.078
He was so determined
that you were meant to be.

19:43.561 --> 19:45.140
Meant to be ours.

19:47.803 --> 19:50.335
Sometimes, in marriage,

19:50.413 --> 19:53.914
someone has to be the one
to push to make the big moves.

19:54.741 --> 19:57.898
And oftentimes in our marriage,
yes, it was your father.

20:00.906 --> 20:02.890
Our marriage wasn't perfect, it's true.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.546
But none are.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.953
And your father wasn't perfect, either.

20:10.016 --> 20:11.914
But he was pretty damn close.

20:13.091 --> 20:14.585
As close as they come.

20:19.232 --> 20:21.906
He pushed... a stranger on me.

20:23.448 --> 20:25.835
And that stranger became my child.

20:27.153 --> 20:29.570
And that child became my life.

20:31.031 --> 20:32.257
He became you.

20:51.813 --> 20:54.179
Road tripping to Memphis
like teenagers.

20:55.828 --> 20:57.804
You're gonna be the
death of me, old man.

20:58.571 --> 21:01.453
I can get a bit bullheaded
when I want something bad.

21:05.571 --> 21:07.973
Don't think that I ever
thanked you for taking me in.

21:07.998 --> 21:09.601
Oh, you definitely did not.

21:13.422 --> 21:15.570
You know he brought you home
without even asking me?

21:17.506 --> 21:18.632
First you.

21:18.984 --> 21:20.164
Then his brother.

21:22.038 --> 21:24.039
He wanted something and then he just...

21:24.477 --> 21:25.804
went ahead and did it.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.099
Bullheaded.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.789
Like father, like son.

21:30.143 --> 21:31.640
Well, I'll take that compliment.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.851
Take that compliment any day.

21:38.981 --> 21:40.953
Didn't turn out so bad, though, huh?

21:41.267 --> 21:42.921
Things that he pushed on you?

21:44.915 --> 21:46.554
No, you're all right, old man.

21:48.509 --> 21:50.149
Could have done without
the Manny in my basement

21:50.173 --> 21:52.053
for a year, but you're all right.

21:54.318 --> 21:55.851
So you like my spot, huh?

21:56.317 --> 21:57.531
Yeah, I do.

21:59.273 --> 22:00.593
I like to come here.

22:00.963 --> 22:02.234
Reminds me of home.

22:03.765 --> 22:05.679
Reminds me of me.

22:06.155 --> 22:07.968
A little less fancy
than your neighborhood.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.000
A little less white.

22:09.025 --> 22:11.679
Yeah, there's that, too.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.402
Come on, you've got
to give me something.

22:21.426 --> 22:23.194
Did any of the other girls sing Sinead?

22:23.219 --> 22:24.430
What did they say when you were done?

22:24.454 --> 22:25.621
Come on, I have been

22:25.655 --> 22:27.976
on the edge of my seat all day.

22:28.858 --> 22:30.304
I don't know, it was just

22:30.526 --> 22:32.085
regular audition stuff.

22:33.688 --> 22:35.046
- Wow.
- Okay.

22:37.327 --> 22:38.398
Oh, my God.

22:39.873 --> 22:41.632
Um, excuse me.

22:41.763 --> 22:42.929
Is this the, uh...

22:43.281 --> 22:44.727
is this the hottest restaurant in town?

22:44.751 --> 22:45.782
I bought the whole place out.

22:45.806 --> 22:46.953
It's a birthday dinner.

22:46.978 --> 22:48.671
- Come on.
- This is nice.

22:48.696 --> 22:49.882
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

22:49.907 --> 22:51.726
Yeah. Okay, wait,
do you want your sister

22:51.751 --> 22:53.281
to sit across from you, next to you,

22:53.306 --> 22:54.466
or just straight in your lap?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.234
Across from me is fine.

22:56.259 --> 22:57.218
- Sorry.
- Sit down.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.023
That gentleman right there,
that is Aito.

22:59.048 --> 23:00.968
He is a genius.

23:00.993 --> 23:02.757
He's from Top Chef, or Iron Chef,

23:02.805 --> 23:04.335
or Amazing Race.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.428
You are a TV star, Aito!

23:07.110 --> 23:08.179
The guy loves me.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.585
- Oh, wow, look at that.
- Thank you.

23:10.684 --> 23:12.244
Oh, there's a... a wine for every fish.

23:12.273 --> 23:14.265
Okay, I'd like to make a toast.

23:14.290 --> 23:15.945
- Yep.
- To the birthday girl.

23:16.435 --> 23:18.398
- And the birthday boy.
- Thank you.

23:18.815 --> 23:19.835
Yeah.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.296
I would just like to say

23:22.790 --> 23:24.351
that I am very proud of you.

23:24.558 --> 23:25.617
So, cheers.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.875
You know what, Tobe?
I actually didn't go

23:29.900 --> 23:32.181
to the audition... I bailed
before I even got in the room.

23:33.859 --> 23:36.250
What? Why, after all
that hard work?

23:36.275 --> 23:37.523
I know. Believe me, I felt

23:37.548 --> 23:39.070
the same way when she told me earlier.

23:39.095 --> 23:40.250
- When she...
- But... yeah.

23:40.275 --> 23:41.399
But let me tell you, you don't know

23:41.411 --> 23:42.612
what it's like being in those rooms

23:42.636 --> 23:44.683
Man, it's horrible. You know how
many times I've walked into a room

23:44.707 --> 23:46.863
and I wanted to bail when I saw
James Marsden ready to read?

23:46.887 --> 23:48.479
Wow. Really?

23:48.840 --> 23:49.873
You told...

23:50.552 --> 23:52.737
Okay, wow. Um...

23:53.248 --> 23:56.581
Toby... Toby.

24:12.714 --> 24:14.886
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:21.401 --> 24:22.714
Went to see my mom.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.682
Okay.

24:27.196 --> 24:29.120
You know she didn't want
to adopt me at first?

24:30.365 --> 24:31.940
My father pushed.

24:36.814 --> 24:38.448
I love my parents.

24:39.209 --> 24:41.034
I loved them together.

24:42.275 --> 24:43.815
But I don't want to be them.

24:47.161 --> 24:48.962
My mother said there's no such thing

24:49.003 --> 24:50.565
as a perfect marriage.

24:51.159 --> 24:53.417
But on that, I have to
disagree with my mother.

24:53.955 --> 24:55.518
I didn't think that was allowed.

24:55.610 --> 24:57.018
Today I'm allowing it.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.378
Because we're perfect, Beth.

25:00.695 --> 25:03.997
And I know this, you see,
because I'm a perfectionist.

25:04.022 --> 25:06.156
So that's kind of my bag, you know?

25:06.387 --> 25:08.948
Been chasing after it my entire life.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.346
Perfection.

25:13.138 --> 25:17.745
And I fail... and I
fail, and I fail and...

25:18.251 --> 25:20.143
the failure leads to self-doubt

25:20.168 --> 25:23.182
and self-loathing, and it's all...

25:23.505 --> 25:24.964
And all this other crap I got

25:24.989 --> 25:26.698
muddled up inside here.

25:28.491 --> 25:30.206
But when it comes to you and me...

25:31.475 --> 25:33.476
baby, there ain't nothing muddled there.

25:35.898 --> 25:38.167
We are perfect together.

25:39.514 --> 25:43.706
We are perfectly imperfect.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.909
And I didn't even know that was a thing.

25:46.648 --> 25:49.143
You see, we don't follow
one another, Beth.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.831
We don't push our own
plans on each other.

25:53.332 --> 25:55.503
We adjust our plans together.

25:57.735 --> 25:59.651
And if I can't adjust to you, then...

26:02.636 --> 26:04.706
...then I have to figure out
another way to do this.

26:05.083 --> 26:06.589
I'll volunteer somewhere,

26:06.614 --> 26:08.281
I'll... Yes, ma'am?

26:10.254 --> 26:11.651
Can I take you somewhere?

26:12.117 --> 26:13.253
Where?

26:13.896 --> 26:16.104
I want to adjust your perfect plan.

26:20.885 --> 26:22.471
Is it "perfectly imperfect"?

26:22.496 --> 26:23.863
- Right?
- Yeah.

26:23.907 --> 26:24.909
I like that.

26:45.339 --> 26:47.409
- We open at 8:00.
- I was just...

26:47.456 --> 26:49.743
You know, my wife, she sang
here a few months back.

26:50.096 --> 26:51.057
Rebecca Pearson?

26:51.082 --> 26:52.779
She sang with a jazz band?

26:53.050 --> 26:55.615
Brunette. She's a knockout.

26:56.305 --> 26:58.628
Good for her. We open at 8:00.

27:01.644 --> 27:04.456
The thing is, she's not
with the band anymore.

27:04.882 --> 27:07.128
She's going solo, and I
thought maybe you'd...

27:07.528 --> 27:10.112
you'd like to book her for a solo gig,

27:10.137 --> 27:12.534
considering how well she did
the first time around.

27:13.986 --> 27:15.081
Is this for real?

27:15.792 --> 27:16.872
Are you for real right now?

27:17.745 --> 27:19.196
Look, come on, I could pay you.

27:19.909 --> 27:21.741
I'll pay you to give her a monthly gig.

27:21.783 --> 27:23.089
You know, just... once a month.

27:23.114 --> 27:25.194
- You know, something that...
- Hey, hey, hey, pal...

27:25.733 --> 27:28.182
you're embarrassing
yourself and your wife.

27:28.956 --> 27:30.370
We're booked months in advance,

27:30.395 --> 27:32.930
we don't do solo acts,
I've got nothing for you.

27:36.528 --> 27:39.003
Okay, thanks. Thanks for the trouble.

28:01.481 --> 28:03.515
- Dude, just...
- Come on, hey, listen, man.

28:03.702 --> 28:05.214
She didn't want to disappoint you.

28:05.239 --> 28:07.026
Do you understand? And, hey, listen,

28:07.051 --> 28:08.542
I know I overdid it with the dinner.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.042
My fault, okay, but I was trying

28:10.067 --> 28:11.199
to take her mind off of the audition.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.011
That is not your job, Kevin.

28:13.378 --> 28:15.917
That's the point, it's
not your job, okay?

28:15.942 --> 28:17.620
I-I... She's going to be my wife.

28:17.645 --> 28:19.870
I'm supposed to be her person.

28:19.895 --> 28:21.886
Not you. All right?
I'm the one who's supposed

28:21.911 --> 28:23.812
to cheer her up,
I'm the one who's supposed

28:23.837 --> 28:25.362
to buy her birthday dinner.

28:25.387 --> 28:26.479
Then buy the dinner!

28:26.504 --> 28:27.871
- Split the dinner with me.
- I can't...

28:27.895 --> 28:29.042
I can't afford this crap!

28:29.737 --> 28:33.362
Okay? And I hate that you pay for
meals while we're out, every time.

28:33.387 --> 28:35.714
What is that? You're
not her father, Kev.

28:35.739 --> 28:36.870
And you're not her husband.

28:36.895 --> 28:39.301
Okay, stop right there. Do not tell me
how to take care of my sister.

28:39.325 --> 28:41.144
I've been taking care of her
for a really long time.

28:41.168 --> 28:42.605
Yeah, and how well is that
working out for her?

28:42.629 --> 28:43.824
Just fine, thank you vey much.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.387
Yeah? She doesn't need to be
coddled. She needs to be pushed.

28:45.411 --> 28:47.823
Stop it! Both of you.

28:50.085 --> 28:51.753
I'm a 37-year-old woman.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.557
And I shouldn't need
to be pushed or coddled.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.070
Not by a man, not by a husband,

29:00.095 --> 29:02.096
not by a brother, not by anyone.

29:05.315 --> 29:07.155
I don't even know what
you're saying right now.

29:07.915 --> 29:08.784
- Just...
- Ugh...

29:08.809 --> 29:09.910
Where are you going?

29:10.137 --> 29:11.221
Back to the audition

29:11.246 --> 29:13.175
to wipe the floor with those bitches.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.643
That's where I'm going.
And don't follow me.

29:18.430 --> 29:19.761
Well, you heard her, so...

29:20.422 --> 29:21.479
Don't do it.

29:22.751 --> 29:24.268
- Don't...
- I'm...

29:25.174 --> 29:26.174
Don't, do...

29:26.485 --> 29:27.815
Man, she's my ride.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.159
You have to give me a ride.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.800
Come on, get in the car. Get...

29:30.939 --> 29:32.604
How do you... I don't even...

29:32.629 --> 29:34.764
You reach under the thing, and you...

29:36.848 --> 29:38.081
Happy birthday.

29:39.532 --> 29:40.745
Thank you.

29:43.486 --> 29:44.831
I had it bound for you.

29:51.379 --> 29:52.917
This was his favorite spot.

29:56.596 --> 29:58.651
I've been coming here almost every day,

30:00.334 --> 30:03.448
trying to figure out how I can
give you what you want.

30:06.144 --> 30:07.948
Trying to wrap my head around it.

30:10.794 --> 30:13.167
And I know you have
this notion in your mind,

30:13.569 --> 30:17.198
this notion of a perfect little newborn

30:17.223 --> 30:19.224
that we could shape
and mold from scratch,

30:19.249 --> 30:20.698
like Play-Doh, but...

30:21.974 --> 30:24.065
Randall, if we're really gonna do this,

30:25.643 --> 30:27.003
I think this is the way.

30:31.283 --> 30:33.846
Your parents did
something wonderful for you.

30:34.673 --> 30:36.974
And because of that,
you had a wonderful life.

30:36.999 --> 30:39.221
But things could have been
very different for you.

30:40.530 --> 30:41.925
That could have been you.

30:47.319 --> 30:49.315
If you really want
to do this, if you really want

30:49.340 --> 30:53.136
to risk our perfectly imperfect
life for something,

30:54.906 --> 30:56.417
let's go all the way.

30:57.752 --> 30:59.453
Let's take in an older kid

30:59.478 --> 31:02.401
who no one else in the
whole damn world is gonna help.

31:16.988 --> 31:18.988
Oh, sorry we're all done.

31:19.052 --> 31:20.448
You have to let me audition.

31:21.739 --> 31:23.471
I can do any song on your list.

31:23.647 --> 31:26.706
I was here before, but I lost
my nerve, and I'm a singer.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.171
Well, I used to be more of one
when I was kid, but...

31:29.195 --> 31:30.589
Fine. Which song?

31:31.432 --> 31:33.150
- "Nothing Compares 2 U."
- Let's go.

31:33.175 --> 31:35.339
All right, guys,
one more: "Nothing Compares 2 U."

31:36.675 --> 31:38.026
Uh, I was also thinking

31:38.051 --> 31:39.451
- that I could just...
- Two, three,

31:39.539 --> 31:40.539
four.

Okay.

32:08.105 --> 32:09.385
- Talk to you tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

32:15.207 --> 32:16.207
No.

32:16.715 --> 32:17.749
No.

32:18.214 --> 32:19.781
You will not dismiss me like that.

32:19.815 --> 32:21.282
And you will not dismiss me

32:21.317 --> 32:23.318
because I don't look
like that girl up there.

32:23.352 --> 32:25.020
I know I'm not what you imagined,

32:25.054 --> 32:27.222
but I will not walk out
of this room and allow you

32:27.256 --> 32:29.290
to just give this gig
to a lesser singer

32:29.325 --> 32:30.932
because she's a size two.

32:31.189 --> 32:33.128
Because I've been living
versions of that story

32:33.153 --> 32:36.182
my entire life, and I
can't do it anymore.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.096

33:15.793 --> 33:17.151
She's our backup singer.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.792
She was our lead singer,

33:18.817 --> 33:20.777
but we demoted her because
she wasn't good enough.

33:21.339 --> 33:23.721
Your pitch is good, but
your range is limited

33:23.746 --> 33:26.112
and your falsetto blows;
You're out of practice, right?

33:26.137 --> 33:27.816
You can't waltz in here
and compete with girls

33:27.840 --> 33:29.621
who have been honing their
craft at open mic nights

33:29.645 --> 33:30.932
since they were 16 years old.

33:31.557 --> 33:33.157
I-I don't care what dress size you wear.

33:33.463 --> 33:35.112
It's... you're not good enough, honey.

33:40.217 --> 33:42.682
Toby, she was the one
that told me my father had died.

33:43.117 --> 33:46.151
Uh, 17 years old, she had to be
the one to tell me that.

33:47.972 --> 33:50.556
She's not just my sister, Toby.

33:50.581 --> 33:52.182
I'm not just her brother, we...

33:53.581 --> 33:56.026
We've walked side-by-side
through an entire life together,

33:56.051 --> 33:58.432
and these things
that we've experienced are...

33:59.373 --> 34:00.401
you know.

34:05.481 --> 34:07.104
I'm not that good an actor.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.431
Uh, I'm not, I'm not-I'm not

34:11.456 --> 34:13.273
really that good at anything,
to be honest with you.

34:13.297 --> 34:15.690
Uh, I'm always the guy in
the room trying the hardest.

34:20.743 --> 34:22.339
Being her brother, I...

34:23.449 --> 34:25.947
I never had to try to be good at that,

34:26.112 --> 34:27.261
you know? So...

34:29.793 --> 34:31.550
I can't just cut the cord that quickly

34:31.574 --> 34:33.425
'cause she met this amazing guy.

34:37.050 --> 34:38.317
I know.

34:41.025 --> 34:43.534
I do need you to stretch
it a little bit.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.018
I know.

34:51.007 --> 34:52.143
Yeah.

34:53.181 --> 34:54.614
That did not go well.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.181
- Oh.
- No, no, no, it's okay,

34:56.206 --> 34:59.909
because it wasn't about
my weight or my age,

35:00.047 --> 35:01.648
it was about my lack of ability.

35:01.784 --> 35:03.932
Which is fantastic.
'Cause I can do this.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.839
I know I can do this.

35:07.515 --> 35:09.557
Just gonna have to work my way up.

35:09.998 --> 35:10.971
Hmm.

35:10.996 --> 35:12.196
Well.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.487
But, ooh, I need a drink.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.104
Does anyone want a nightcap?

35:15.679 --> 35:17.807
I... I'm-I got an early call.

35:17.832 --> 35:19.620
So I'm gonna bail on the drink.

35:19.645 --> 35:20.645
Okay.

35:21.143 --> 35:22.839
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

35:22.864 --> 35:25.398
And, uh, I'll let you take it from here.

35:27.137 --> 35:28.237
Drink?

35:33.711 --> 35:36.526
And now, an addendum
to my earlier advice,

35:36.807 --> 35:39.628
if I'm so lucky
as to still have your ear.

35:40.870 --> 35:43.573
I loved you, I lost you.

35:45.319 --> 35:47.893
And I advise you, 'twas better

35:48.594 --> 35:51.073
than to never having had loved at all.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.956
But now, with more years,

35:58.017 --> 36:00.351
with more time, more perspective,

36:00.552 --> 36:03.050
I see things in a slightly new way.

36:03.538 --> 36:06.659
So here, my good son,
is a father's advice,

36:06.684 --> 36:08.393
updated and recalled.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.190
It's better to have
loved and lost, surely...

36:14.092 --> 36:17.073
...but try not to lose it at all.

36:17.098 --> 36:18.175
Jack?

36:21.510 --> 36:23.612
- Hey, Jack?

36:25.182 --> 36:26.261
Hi.

36:26.770 --> 36:27.987
Hi.

36:29.074 --> 36:33.721
So, I was trying to remember
myself tonight, Jack.

36:35.851 --> 36:37.385
The person I used to be.

36:37.410 --> 36:39.526
And then I started remembering you, too.

36:40.016 --> 36:45.096
And I'm not the only one
who gave up on my dreams, Jack.

36:45.121 --> 36:47.026
We both did, right?

36:47.934 --> 36:51.487
And we, we realized
an even bigger dream,

36:51.512 --> 36:52.940
an even more massive dream.

36:52.965 --> 36:56.253
And I'm... I'm still really upset,

36:56.382 --> 36:58.854
and I don't think I'm ready
to talk about any of that yet.

36:58.879 --> 36:59.925
But...

37:01.141 --> 37:03.242
I shouldn't have let you leave.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.535
And not just because of all of
the beautiful things you said,

37:09.560 --> 37:12.362
I shouldn't have let you leave
because that's not what we do.

37:12.748 --> 37:14.651
That's not who we are, that's not us.

37:14.714 --> 37:16.348
I know that, that's not us.

37:17.062 --> 37:19.151
I know that I'm not deeply unhappy,

37:19.176 --> 37:21.581
and I'm not unfulfilled,
and you're not an alcoholic,

37:21.606 --> 37:22.773
and you're not your father.

37:22.798 --> 37:24.409
And even when I watch Tom Hanks,

37:24.434 --> 37:26.128
I sit there and I think to myself,

37:26.548 --> 37:27.706
"He's not so great."

37:27.982 --> 37:29.104
And who does that?

37:29.129 --> 37:31.112
Who watches Tom Hanks and thinks,

37:31.137 --> 37:32.887
"You know what? I'm married to
a man that's better than that."

37:32.911 --> 37:36.503
Bec, you don't know everything about me.

37:38.216 --> 37:39.339
- Yes, I do.
- No.

37:39.364 --> 37:40.777
- I know everything about you.
- Rebecca, you don't know...

37:40.801 --> 37:42.050
I'm drunk right now.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.307
I have been drunk all day.

37:47.604 --> 37:50.651
I have been drunk for weeks.

37:52.536 --> 37:56.190
And I thought I had it under
control, like the first time, but...

37:57.783 --> 38:00.550
I have a problem, Rebecca.

38:02.633 --> 38:04.948
And I've hidden it from you

38:06.651 --> 38:08.190
for a very long time.

38:09.824 --> 38:13.057
And I've-I've hidden it from our kids.

38:15.003 --> 38:17.089
And I need to get a handle on it

38:17.114 --> 38:19.768
before I can walk back into that house.

38:25.987 --> 38:27.307
And I'm sorry,

38:28.544 --> 38:29.544
baby, I...

38:32.980 --> 38:34.479
...I am very embarrassed.

38:36.961 --> 38:38.667
And I am very sorry.

38:42.091 --> 38:45.448
But I need to fix this on my own.

39:21.689 --> 39:22.932
Get in the car.

39:25.588 --> 39:26.917
Get in the car, Jack.

39:29.445 --> 39:32.464
You are my husband, and I am your wife,

39:32.637 --> 39:36.425
and if you have a problem,
we will fix it together.

39:39.112 --> 39:41.151
I just need you to get in the car.

39:41.924 --> 39:43.221
So we can go home.

39:44.538 --> 39:46.120
Come on.

39:49.557 --> 39:50.706
Come on, baby.

39:50.801 --> 39:51.801
Okay.

39:51.826 --> 39:53.596
I need you to get in the car.

39:53.838 --> 39:55.839
I need you to get in the car.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.604
Everything's gonna be fine.

40:10.352 --> 40:11.503
Jack, look at me.

40:15.551 --> 40:16.854
A few months from now,

40:17.707 --> 40:19.440
everything will be back to normal.

40:52.592 --> 40:54.260
I'm gonna get some pillows.

40:56.924 --> 40:58.440
- We... we...

40:58.465 --> 40:59.659
We have to find Kev.

41:04.347 --> 41:06.104
He needs to hear it from me.

41:35.624 --> 41:36.628
No...

41:56.317 --> 41:57.116
How did you stop before Jack?

41:57.217 --> 42:00.320
It was not easy.

42:00.421 --> 42:03.589
I'm not going to overreact to
everything she says this time.

42:03.691 --> 42:07.260
You wanted to adopt and now
you're Randalling out on me.

42:07.361 --> 42:09.629
Ok stop making my name a thing.
