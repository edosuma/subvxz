WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:03.137
- WHEN YOU AUDITIONED
FOR ALVIN AILEY,

00:03.240 --> 00:04.377
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THEY WERE IN NEW YORK.

00:04.480 --> 00:05.583
- EVERYBODY KNOWS
THEY'RE IN NEW YORK.

00:05.690 --> 00:06.588
- I DIDN'T.

00:06.690 --> 00:08.999
- MY DAD IS SO FAR UNDERWATER
ON THIS THING.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.589
- THE PLAN IS TO BUNDLE
YOUR DAD'S HOLDINGS

00:10.700 --> 00:12.247
WITH A BUNCH OF HIGHER-END
PROPERTIES.

00:12.350 --> 00:13.692
- YOUR MOTHER'S SLIPPING AWAY
FROM ME.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.483
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.624
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH?

00:16.740 --> 00:17.593
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT

00:17.700 --> 00:19.042
SHE APPARENTLY SHE SLEPT WITH
THE GUY ONCE.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.424
- UGH!
- BUT IT'S OVER.

00:20.530 --> 00:21.394
- UGH!

00:21.500 --> 00:23.229
- AMBER TOLD ME
TO BREAK UP WITH STEVE,

00:23.330 --> 00:26.879
AND THEN SHE HAD SEX
WITH HIM.

00:26.990 --> 00:30.027
- IS THAT TRUE?

01:00.640 --> 01:02.437
- DAD, THAT'S NOT--
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.438
THAT'S NOT--

01:03.540 --> 01:05.269
- OH, EXCUSE ME,
I THINK I KNOW MY WAY AROUND

01:05.370 --> 01:06.405
A CREAM CHEESE
AND JELLY SANDWICH.

01:06.510 --> 01:07.784
- YOU SHOULD WATCH MOM
DO IT.

01:07.890 --> 01:09.027
- I'LL DO IT.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.574
- YOU HAVE TO--
YOU COULD LEARN FROM HER.

01:10.690 --> 01:12.089
- I WILL WATCH AND LEARN.

01:12.210 --> 01:13.234
- LEARN FROM HER.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.137
- WAIT. THIS WAY.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.617
- WATCH MOMMY MAKE IT.
YOU CAN LEARN FROM HER.

01:17.730 --> 01:19.106
- SEE, WATCH THIS.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.074
- HONEY.
- WATCH THIS.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.454
- HEY, HEY.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.596
- THAT'S HOW I JUST
STRETCH IT ALL AROUND.

01:23.700 --> 01:24.769
OH, MY GOD.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.076
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

01:26.180 --> 01:27.909
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR HAIR?

01:28.010 --> 01:29.591
- NOTHING.
- HONEY, IS THAT PERMANENT?

01:29.710 --> 01:30.779
- IT LOOKS LIKE A PANTHER
OR, LIKE--

01:30.880 --> 01:33.041
- I'M GOING TO SCHOOL.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.878
UM, AND I'M TAKING THE BUS
TO SCHOOL TODAY

01:34.990 --> 01:36.639
AND I'M LATE,
SO I HAVE TO GO.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.741
- UH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND.

01:38.850 --> 01:39.430
- HONEY, YOUR HAIR IS BLACK.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.269
- IT KIND OF ALSO
LOOKS LIKE A--

01:41.370 --> 01:43.099
SHE LOOKS LIKE A VAMPIRE
FROM TWILIGHT.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.406
- DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?
- I DIDN'T--NO.

01:44.510 --> 01:45.954
I DIDN'T TELL HER
IT WAS OKAY TO DO THAT.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.617
- I LIKE IT.

01:47.720 --> 01:50.109
- MOM, I'M DEAD WITHOUT THIS
BIOLOGY HOMEWORK, SERIOUSLY.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.178
- I KNOW, WE'LL FIND IT.
HEY, THAT WAS THE SCHOOL.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.724
UH, HAVE YOU BEEN
CUTTING CLASS?

01:53.830 --> 01:55.001
- WHAT? THAT'S CRAZY.

01:55.110 --> 01:56.384
- YEAH, SO WHERE
ARE YOU GOING NOW?

01:56.490 --> 01:58.310
- UH, JUST GOING TO SCHOOL,
OF COURSE.

01:58.420 --> 01:59.739
EVERY DAY,
LIKE A GOOD CHILD.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.807
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

02:00.910 --> 02:01.899
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

02:02.010 --> 02:02.977
- AMBER, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY HOMEWORK?

02:03.080 --> 02:04.251
- NOPE. SORRY.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.668
- ARE YOU CUTTING--
OKAY, BYE.

02:05.780 --> 02:06.769
- IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
IN THE KITCHEN.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.108
- OKAY. YEAH.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:08.230 --> 02:09.674
I SAW A BUNCH OF PAPERS
ON THE SIDEBOARD.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.361
- SERIOUSLY.
- UH-HUH, I LOOKED THERE, MOM.

02:11.470 --> 02:13.335
OH, I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.600

A THOUSAND TIMES.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.641
- WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

02:15.750 --> 02:17.126
- IT WAS JUST UNDER
THAT NOTEBOOK.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.616
I LOOKED THERE A MILLION TIMES.
WHAT'S THAT?

02:18.720 --> 02:19.857

02:19.960 --> 02:21.097

02:23.070 --> 02:24.378
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.754
- YOU WERE?
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.373

06:26.760 --> 06:28.170

THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.895
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.319
- I JUST FEEL WORRIED ABOUT HER
AND WANTED TO ASK YOU,

06:32.420 --> 06:34.035
'CAUSE SHE DOES SO WELL
WITH YOU.

06:34.150 --> 06:36.766

YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST

06:54.510 --> 06:56.478
I THINK COMING HERE

06:56.580 --> 06:59.617
UM, IT WAS A MESS
WHERE WE WERE,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.302
BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT
SO MANY PEOPLE

07:02.420 --> 07:05.173
AND IT DIDN'T DISRUPT
THE FAMILY.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.965
I THINK WE'RE BE'I'I'ER
ON OUR OWN,

07:08.080 --> 07:14.076
AND SO...

07:14.190 --> 07:17.079
WE SHOULD MOVE ON AND...

07:17.190 --> 07:21.980
MAKE A MESS SOMEPLACE NEW.

07:22.090 --> 07:24.957
- OKAY.

07:25.060 --> 07:28.541
- THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHAT I CAME TO TELL YOU TODAY.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.615
'CAUSE...

07:35.730 --> 07:40.861
'CAUSE I MISSED YOUR FACE.

07:40.970 --> 07:43.416
SO...

07:43.530 --> 07:47.114

07:49.570 --> 07:51.117

07:51.220 --> 07:53.290
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I--I...

07:53.400 --> 07:57.086
I DON'T THINK THAT
RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS

07:57.200 --> 07:59.156
IS--IS THE ANSWER.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.854
I THINK THAT YOU'RE DOING
A GREAT JOB WITH AMBER.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.439
I THINK YOU'RE
AN INCREDIBLE MOTHER,

08:04.550 --> 08:09.852
AND I THINK SHE'S GONNA DO
JUST FINE HERE,

08:09.970 --> 08:14.657
AND, UM, I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

08:19.490 --> 08:22.209
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

08:27.190 --> 08:28.464
- OH, WOW.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.743

08:36.230 --> 08:37.743
- WELL, NOT ALWAYS.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.373
- I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA LIKE IT.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.027
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.027
IT'S THE GREATEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.540
- DO THEY HAVE BAGELS
LIKE AT BAGEL CITY?

08:44.660 --> 08:47.481
- DO THEY HAVE BAGELS?

08:47.590 --> 08:49.478
DUDE, NEW YORK HAS
THE BEST BAGELS ANYWHERE.

08:49.590 --> 08:50.693
THEY'RE HOT AND FRESH

08:50.800 --> 08:53.030
AND YOU CAN SMELL THEM
EVERYWHERE ON THE STREETS.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.038
YOU'RE GONNA BE SMILING
ALL DAY LONG.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.282
SO HOW COME
I CALL YOU CROSBY?

09:01.400 --> 09:05.018
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:05.130 --> 09:09.089
- I COULD CALL YOU DADDY.
RIGHT?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.952
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

09:11.060 --> 09:13.472
I MEAN, IT'S UP TO YOU,
BUT I WOULD LIKE THAT.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.263
- OKAY.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.996
- OH, OKAY.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.479
HOW ABOUT WE GO TACKLE
THIS CITY,

09:21.590 --> 09:22.693
JUST A COUPLE OF DUDES

09:22.800 --> 09:24.131
IN SEARCH OF A SCIENCE CENTER
AND SOME PIZZA.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.319
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

09:25.420 --> 09:28.218
- OH, YEAH.
- YEAH.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.940
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

09:34.050 --> 09:36.041
WE--WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DID IT.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.320
THAT'S ALL.
I'M JUST ASKING THAT.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.671
- AND I KEEP TELLING YOU,
THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.088
- SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.713
- I THINK YOUR MOTHER'S
JUST CONCERNED

09:42.820 --> 09:44.048
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BE
SOMEBODY YOU'RE NOT.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.787
- EXACTLY.
- WELL, DON'T WORRY.

09:45.890 --> 09:47.050
- WE GOT A CALL
FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.717
YOU DITCHED CHEMISTRY.
- [sighs]

09:48.820 --> 09:51.129
- YOU'VE NEVER DITCHED
A CLASS BEFORE, HADDIE. EVER.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.548
- WHY DID YOU DITCH CHEM?
- WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.059
- ARE AMBER AND STEVE
IN YOUR CLASS?

09:54.170 --> 09:56.343
- IS EVERYTHING
THAT I DO NOW

09:56.450 --> 09:58.202
GONNA BE DEFINED BY
AMBER AND STEVE?

09:58.320 --> 09:59.309
- IS THAT WHY YOU DID IT?

09:59.420 --> 10:01.001
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH AMBER AND STEVE, THEN.

10:01.110 --> 10:03.044
NOTHING AT ALL?
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:03.150 --> 10:04.287
NO, IT DOESN'T.
AND EVEN IF IT DID,

10:04.390 --> 10:06.563
YOU DON'T GET TO ACT LIKE
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.

10:06.670 --> 10:07.898
- I WAS YOUR AGE ONCE,

10:08.020 --> 10:10.534
AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THIS STUFF BEFORE.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.914
- I JUST WANTED TO DYE MY HAIR

10:12.020 --> 10:13.817
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE
MY HAIR COLOR, OKAY?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.501
- OKAY.
- OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

10:15.610 --> 10:17.089
- THANK YOU. CAN I GO?
- THAT'S FAIR.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.089
- OKAY.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.576
- HONEY, I--

10:21.690 --> 10:23.191
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
THIS IS HAPPENING.

10:23.310 --> 10:24.060
LIKE, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

10:24.170 --> 10:26.161
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING ON HERE?

10:26.280 --> 10:27.781
- SHE'S JUST COMPLETELY
SHUT DOWN.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.344
I MEAN,
SHE'S DYING HER HAIR BLACK.

10:29.450 --> 10:30.656
I DON'T RECOGNIZE HER
LITERALLY.

10:30.760 --> 10:31.829
- SHE'S VERY BRIGHT.

10:31.940 --> 10:32.793
I THINK SHE'S GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.071
SHE'S JUST A TEENAGER.

10:34.180 --> 10:35.169
SHE'S GOING THROUGH
SOME GROWING PAINS.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.043
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
SHE'S A TEENAGE GIRL.

10:37.150 --> 10:38.549
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
TEENAGE GIRLS GO THOUGH, OKAY?

10:38.670 --> 10:40.217
I WAS ONE.
- NO, I DON'T, OKAY?

10:40.320 --> 10:42.140
I ADMIT THAT I DON'T, BUT I
THINK THAT SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.909
NOW LISTEN.
I'M GONNA BE LATE FOR DREW.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.567
OKAY?
I HAVE TO GO MEET HIM.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.467
- WHAT?
LATE FOR DREW? WHY?

10:47.570 --> 10:48.741
- YEAH, I PROMISED HIM
I'D HELP HIM WITH

10:48.850 --> 10:50.010
HIS BASEBALL TRYOUTS.

10:50.130 --> 10:52.917
- OH. THAT'S SO AWESOME,
HONEY.

10:53.030 --> 10:54.167
REALLY?

10:54.270 --> 10:57.091
WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS ON
OUR FAMILY RIGHT NOW?

10:57.200 --> 10:59.134
I'M JUST SAYING.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.001
- HEY.
- HI.

11:08.110 --> 11:10.487
UH, NICE SKY.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.070
MOM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S EXACTLY, UH,

11:14.190 --> 11:16.351
WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW,
RIGHT NOW WITH YOU AND DAD

11:16.460 --> 11:20.044
OR THAT GUY MATTHEW, NOT THAT
IT'S ANY OF MY BUSINESS.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.709
- WELL, UM, IT KIND OF
ISN'T YOUR BUSINESS,

11:23.820 --> 11:27.460
BUT, UM, NOTHING'S GOING ON
AND I TOLD HIM, UH,

11:27.580 --> 11:29.741
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.191
- OKAY. I DON'T KNOW.

11:31.310 --> 11:32.925
DAD JUST SAID HE WAS
AT THE HOUSE, SO--

11:33.030 --> 11:35.021
- THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

11:35.140 --> 11:36.584
HE TALKS TO EVERYBODY
BUT ME.

11:36.690 --> 11:39.614
- LOOK, UH, JULIA'S HAVING
THAT GUY TIMM

11:39.730 --> 11:41.721
OVER TO HER HOUSE FOR DINNER
TO TALK TO DAD

11:41.830 --> 11:43.457
ABOUT THE PROPERTY.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.936
I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE THERE TOO.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.144
- WELL, I SHOULD BE THERE.
BUT WHY DIDN'T HE INVITE ME?

11:47.250 --> 11:48.592
YOU SEE?
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.769
- I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.074
IF YOU SIT AROUND
WAITING FOR HIM TO INVITE YOU

11:51.190 --> 11:52.942
OR CALL YOU
OR TELL YOU WHAT TO DO,

11:53.050 --> 11:54.085
YOU COULD BE WAITING
FOREVER.

11:54.190 --> 11:55.737
I MEAN, DON'T BE A VICTIM,
YOU KNOW?

11:55.850 --> 11:57.181
JUST...DO SOMETHING.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.053
YOU DON'T NEED AN INVITATION
TO YOUR OWN LIFE.

12:02.790 --> 12:06.339
- YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.135
- THANK YOU.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.891
- AND I'M REALLY GLAD
I TAUGHT YOU THAT.

12:14.180 --> 12:15.966
both: GOOD HEARTED WOMAN

12:16.080 --> 12:20.619
IN LOVE WITH
A GOOD TIMIN' MAN

12:22.980 --> 12:26.393
- SHE LOVES HIM IN SPITE
OF HIS WICKED WAYS

12:26.500 --> 12:29.014
BUT SHE DON'T UNDERSTAND

12:29.120 --> 12:31.680
- OH! OH, MY GOD,
THE PIANO'S BREAKING.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.839
YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS NOW,
RIGHT?

12:33.960 --> 12:36.292
YOUR SKIN LOOKS GREAT OUT HERE.
- THANK YOU.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.264
- AND YOUR HAIR'S GOT
KIND OF SOME BODY NOW--

12:38.370 --> 12:39.120
THAT SALT AIR.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.879
COME ON NOW, HAH!
- HI THERE!

12:42.000 --> 12:43.513
THANK YOLAIVIIERY MUCH.

12:43.620 --> 12:47.238
I COULD NOT GET ADAM
TO DRINK ONE BEER WITH ME--

12:47.350 --> 12:49.136
- NO WAY.
IF HE DRINKS TOO MUCH,

12:49.250 --> 12:50.649
THE STICK MIGHT
FALL OUT OF HIS ASS.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.409
- [laughs]
- THAT'S THE GOOD STUFF.

12:53.530 --> 12:54.246
- WAIT A MINUTE.

12:54.350 --> 12:56.523
AH!
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

12:56.630 --> 12:58.905
IT WAS NICE LIKE THIS
I-IN SAIGON.

12:59.010 --> 13:01.251
THERE WAS
THIS CUTE LITI'LE THING,

13:01.360 --> 13:03.282
AND SHE HAD
THE TIGHTEST LITTLE--

13:03.400 --> 13:04.947
- MM!

13:05.060 --> 13:07.563
DAD, I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
ALL THE DETAILS.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.573
OH, MY GOD,
I'M FEELING SO SICK!

13:12.680 --> 13:16.161
- WITH A TRUCK DRIVIN'
MAN

13:16.270 --> 13:17.578
AH!
- YEAH!

13:17.690 --> 13:19.169
- OH, THAT'S IT.
- WHOO!

13:19.280 --> 13:21.373
YOU WANT ANOTHER BEER,
OR ARE YOU GONNA--

13:21.490 --> 13:23.822
[coughing] YOU LIQUOR
OR FOR A BEER?

13:23.940 --> 13:25.965
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING

13:26.080 --> 13:28.480
HALF THE TIME THESE DAYS.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.318
- HUH?

13:30.430 --> 13:31.909
- NOTHING.

13:32.010 --> 13:35.320
YOUR MOTHER'S GONNA FORGIVE ME,
YOU KNOW.

13:35.430 --> 13:36.943
SHE'S GOT TO.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.189
- YEAH, THIS THING'S GONNA
BLOW OVER, RIGHT? I MEAN--

13:39.300 --> 13:40.324
- HELL, YEAH.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.941
- JULIA'LL FIX
ALL THE REAL ESTATE STUFF,

13:42.060 --> 13:45.405
AND THEN YOU'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:45.510 --> 13:47.956
- YOU KNOW...

13:48.060 --> 13:51.302
CROSBY, THIS WHOLE THING HERE
WITH JASMINE

13:51.410 --> 13:53.298
GOING TO NEW YORK
AND TAKING JABBAR,

13:53.410 --> 13:55.469
YOU CAN'T LET THAT--
YOU GOTTA PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN.

13:55.590 --> 13:57.376
SHE CAN'T BE TAKING YOUR SON--

13:57.490 --> 14:00.311
- DAD, I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE STORY--

14:00.420 --> 14:02.763
- THEY'VE GOT DANCE TROUPES
HERE--

14:02.870 --> 14:04.690
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
DANCING?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.244
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT DANCING.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.349
- I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING
I DO KNOW, CROSBY.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.451
YOU GOTTA BE THERE
FOR YOUR KID.

14:09.570 --> 14:11.356
HE'S YOUR SON.

14:11.470 --> 14:14.633
AND YOU CAN'T LET HIM
SLIP AWAY FROM YOU.

14:16.750 --> 14:20.504
YOU HAVE TO MAN UP HERE,
CROSBY.

14:25.510 --> 14:27.819
- YOU REMEMBER ANDREA SOKOLOV?
YOU REMEMBER HER?

14:27.930 --> 14:29.374
SHE DYED HER HAIR BLACK
MY JUNIOR YEAR.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.583
- OH, RIGHT.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.169
- AND THEN SHE TURNED INTO
A TIGRESS, LIKE, OVERNIGHT.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.690
- OVERNIGHT.
- WELL, THANKS FOR THAT.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.722
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- SHE'S WAS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.387
THAT WAS WHAT THAT SIGNIFIED.
- OH, GOD.

14:37.490 --> 14:38.411
- IT'S A TEENAGE THING.

14:38.530 --> 14:40.316
THERE'S A LOT WORSE THINGS
SHE COULD BE DOING.

14:40.430 --> 14:42.591
- NO, IT'S ENTIRELY INNOCUOUS.
IT'S--IT'S A PHASE, RIGHT?

14:42.700 --> 14:43.837
- SHE'S GONNA GROW OUT OF IT.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.042
- WELL, TELL THAT
TO AN DREA'S PARENTS.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.388
SHE'S RIDING A POLE
AT THE STRIP CLUB

14:46.500 --> 14:47.637
BY THE BOWLING ALLEY.
- THAT'S TRUE.

14:47.740 --> 14:49.321
- YOU NEED TO GET HER HAIR BACK
TO ITS NATURAL COLOR.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.748
- OR SHE'S GONNA BECOME
A STRIPPER.

14:50.850 --> 14:52.010
- SERIOUSLY?

14:52.130 --> 14:53.336
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR TAILLIGHT?

14:53.440 --> 14:55.328
- I DON'T KNOW, SOME GUY MUST
HAVE JUST SMACKED INTO IT.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.919
JUST DROVE OFF,
DIDN'T LEAVE A NOTE, NOTHING.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.258
- THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.098
- YEAH, SOCIETY'S COMING APART
AT THE SEAMS.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.519
- HEY--
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:01.620 --> 15:03.724
IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE,
BECAUSE HOW DIFFICULT IS IT

15:03.830 --> 15:05.411
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR ACTIONS, YOU KNOW?

15:05.520 --> 15:08.068
YOU BUST SOMEBODY'S TAILLIGHT,
STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

15:08.180 --> 15:09.386
- ANYBODY COULD DO THAT.

15:09.490 --> 15:10.240
- YOU OKAY?
- NO.

15:10.350 --> 15:13.001
- WHAT'S WRCMNNT WITH YOU?

15:13.110 --> 15:15.249
I WAS DRINKING LAST NIGHT
WITH ZEEK.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.804
- ZEEK?
THEY'VE BOTH GONE INSANE.

15:16.910 --> 15:18.184
- JUST YOU AND DAD?
- BOTI'OMLESS PIT.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.666
- WAIT, OKAY, WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH MOM AND DAD?

15:19.780 --> 15:20.804
'CAUSE I WAS AT THE HOUSE
YESTERDAY.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.353
SHE WAS VERY WEIRD.

15:22.470 --> 15:24.847
SHE WAS VERY NEGATIVE ABOUT THEM
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

15:24.950 --> 15:26.463
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT SHE'S SO UPSET ABOUT.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.957
- YEAH, IT FEELS LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.288
- ARE YOU CATCHING THIS?

15:30.410 --> 15:32.571
HEY, GUYS.
- WHAT WAS THAT LOOK?

15:32.690 --> 15:34.066
- WITH THE SECRET--

15:34.170 --> 15:35.899
- DO YOU GUYS HAVE A SECRET
OR SOMETHING?

15:36.000 --> 15:36.967
- GO AHEAD.
- HUH?

15:37.070 --> 15:40.415
- DAD HAD AN AFFAIR.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.623
- WHAT?
- COME ON.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.129
- I WOULDN'T JOKE ABOUT THAT.
- SHH, CROSBY.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.649
- DAD HAD AN AFFAIR?

15:44.770 --> 15:46.590
- WE'RE NOT SCREWING
WITH YOU.

15:46.700 --> 15:50.113
I WOULDN'T LIE ABOUT THIS, OKAY?
IT HAPPENED MANY YEARS AGO.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.211
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
HE DID THAT TO HER.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.844
- I KNOW.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.326
- BY THE WAY, I'M SORRY,

15:56.430 --> 15:58.250
BUT I CAN'T PRACTICE
WITH DREW TONIGHT.

15:58.370 --> 16:00.326
- WHY NOT?

16:00.440 --> 16:02.226
- KRISTINA--I'VE GOT STUFF TO DO
AT THE HOUSE.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.228
JUST TRY AND KEEP THE PEACE,
ALL RIGHT?

16:04.340 --> 16:05.648
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.786
- SORRY.
- NO. I'M SORRY.

16:07.890 --> 16:09.949
- [makes airplane sounds]
- MOM, I CAN BARELY LOOK AT YOU.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.207
OH, MY GOD. MOM.

16:11.310 --> 16:12.720
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON'T HIT ME.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.206
- WE'RE PLAYING BASEBALL.

16:14.310 --> 16:15.891
- YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT--

16:16.000 --> 16:17.627
- ARE YOU READY?
- DOES IT MA'I'I'ER?

16:17.730 --> 16:19.277
WHAT'S TO KNOW?
YOU THROW IT, YOU CATCH IT.

16:19.390 --> 16:20.766
ADAM COULDN'T MAKE IT.
- WHY COULDN'T HE MAKE IT?

16:20.870 --> 16:22.178
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE JUST COULDN'T.

16:22.290 --> 16:23.382
[hollers]
- I KNOW.

16:23.490 --> 16:24.878
- SORRY.
- IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.561
- DID THAT GET YOU ON THE LEG?
- IT WAS BECAUSE OF ME.

16:26.670 --> 16:27.807
- I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WAS.

16:27.910 --> 16:28.899
- I'M SURE THEY THINK THAT,
YOU KNOW,

16:29.020 --> 16:30.772
HADDIE DYED HER HAIR BLACK
BECAUSE OF ME TOO.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.121
- HADDIE DYED HER HAIR BLACK.

16:33.230 --> 16:34.322
I MEAN,
WHAT ISN'T YOUR FAULT?

16:34.440 --> 16:35.293
- YEAH, I KNOW.
EVERYTHING IS--

16:35.400 --> 16:37.436
- CAN WE PLEASE
NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW?

16:37.540 --> 16:38.529
PLEASE.

16:38.650 --> 16:41.335
- SHE DYED HER HAIR BLACK
BECAUSE SHE'S MAD AT ME--

16:41.440 --> 16:42.543
- WELL, I MEAN,
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE

16:42.650 --> 16:45.778
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU DID
BEFORE, YOU KNOW? I MEAN--

16:45.900 --> 16:47.413
- REALLY?
YOU'RE SAYING THIS NOW?

16:47.520 --> 16:49.408
- NO, I'M NOT--
- I'VE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.373
- I KNOW, I FEEL BAD.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:50.490 --> 16:51.514
- I FEEL BAD.

16:51.630 --> 16:52.961
- I'M JUST TIRED OF YOU
WHINING ABOUT IT.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.411
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

16:54.530 --> 16:55.758
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PLAY
A NICE GAME FOR A SECOND.

16:55.870 --> 16:56.939
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO LIVE MY LIFE--

17:02.330 --> 17:03.843
IT'S ONE THING
IF YOU'RE MISERABLE.

17:03.950 --> 17:05.702
IT'S ANOTHER THING IF YOU
BRING US ALL DOWN WITH YOU.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.405
AND WHY I CAN'T
JUST MOVE THERE WITH YOU.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.579

IS IT SUPER-COMPLICATED?

20:01.020 --> 20:02.430
I THINK I CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.646
SHE STOOD BY YOU
FOR 40 YEARS.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.547
YOU CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
AND DRINK BEER

20:07.650 --> 20:08.787
AND LISTEN TO THE RADIO
AND THINK

20:08.890 --> 20:11.233
SHE'S GONNA COME OVER HERE
AND BEG YOU TO COME HOME.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.784
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

20:12.900 --> 20:15.209
YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE HER.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.619
DO YOU GET THAT?

20:17.730 --> 20:21.655
YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE
AND FIGHT FOR HER.

36:39.190 --> 36:40.600
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

36:40.710 --> 36:42.359
- YES.

36:42.470 --> 36:43.914
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

36:44.020 --> 36:46.909
I SMOKED AND DRANK A LOT.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO SHORT.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.986
- [laughs]

36:49.100 --> 36:50.476
- YOU KNOW,
YOU TRY TO ACT SO TOUGH,

36:50.580 --> 36:53.617
BUT I JUST KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

36:53.720 --> 36:55.893
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I SEE YOU.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.753
I SEE HOW SMART YOU ARE

36:58.870 --> 37:00.895
AND HOW FUNNY YOU ARE

37:01.010 --> 37:03.001
AND HOW BRAVE YOU ARE,

37:03.110 --> 37:05.522
AND I'M JUST SO PROUD
OF YOU.

37:05.630 --> 37:08.906
AND I'M JUST SO GLAD
THAT YOU'RE MY KID.

37:10.950 --> 37:13.498
- THANKS FOR COMING FOR ME.

37:13.610 --> 37:17.706
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE MY MOM.

37:17.820 --> 37:20.744
[sniffling]

37:23.240 --> 37:24.787
- MY GOD, I CAN'T TAKE IT.

37:24.890 --> 37:26.096
- I KNOW.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.827
WE REALLY GOTTA
GET IT TOGETHER.

37:27.930 --> 37:32.276
- [chuckles]

37:36.180 --> 37:39.764
- YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PLANE
YOU'RE FLYING ON TODAY?

37:39.870 --> 37:42.452
A BOEING 767.

37:42.570 --> 37:44.879
THERE'S 3 MILLION PARTS
ON IT,

37:44.980 --> 37:47.221
AND IT TAKES 800 COMPANIES
TO MAKE ALL THOSE PARTS.

37:47.330 --> 37:49.946
AND EACH ONE COSTS
150 MILLION BUCKS.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.437
- HOW COME YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT AIRPLANES?

37:52.540 --> 37:54.292
- 'CAUSE I LOVE AIRPLANES.

37:54.410 --> 37:57.197
I HAVE SINCE I WAS A KID.

37:57.300 --> 38:02.135
- YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME,
DADDY.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.891
- HEY, SWEETIE.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.036
SWEETIE. FINISH YOUR CEREAL.

38:07.140 --> 38:07.936
UH, TAXI'S GONNA BE HERE

38:08.040 --> 38:10.133
- ALL RIGHT, MOMMY.
- HEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

38:10.250 --> 38:11.524
- UH, YEAH, YEAH.

38:11.630 --> 38:14.098
UM, JUST FINISHING
PACKING MY SUITCASE, SO...

38:14.220 --> 38:15.494
- OKAY.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.181
- YOU'LL MAKE SURE
THE MOVERS

38:17.290 --> 38:18.257
DON'T MISS ANYTHING?

38:18.360 --> 38:19.702
- UH-HUH.

38:19.810 --> 38:21.596
- AND, UH,
A COUPLE OF THOSE BOXES UP THERE

38:21.710 --> 38:23.154
ARE FRAGILE,
SO MAKE SURE THEY ARE--

38:23.260 --> 38:25.672
- RIGHT, OKAY.
HEY, CAN WE TALK?

38:25.780 --> 38:26.917
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M LISTENING.

38:27.020 --> 38:27.918
[taxi horn honks]
- OKAY.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.055
- OH, THE TAXI'S HERE.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.195
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HE'LL WAIT.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.676
JASMINE. JASMINE.
- WHAT?

38:31.790 --> 38:34.884
- WELL, CAN YOU STOP PACKING
FOR ONE SECOND?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.514
I HATE MY DAD RIGHT NOW
FOR WHAT HE DID TO MY MOM.

38:37.620 --> 38:40.828
BUT HE WAS A GREAT DAD.

38:40.930 --> 38:42.795
YOU KNOW,
HE WAS ALWAYS MAKING ME LAUGH

38:42.900 --> 38:43.821
AND TAKING ME PLACES,

38:43.940 --> 38:47.103
AND HE SMILED
EVERY TIME HE SAW ME.

38:47.220 --> 38:48.528
AND HE THOUGHT I WAS FUNNY,

38:48.630 --> 38:50.973
AND HE COULD NEVER
STAY MAD AT ME

38:51.080 --> 38:53.184
BECAUSE HE LOVED ME
SO MUCH.

38:53.290 --> 38:56.327
- [chuckles]

38:56.430 --> 39:00.184
- AND...

39:00.300 --> 39:02.985
THE POINT
I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS

39:03.090 --> 39:07.049
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHO I WOULD BE WITHOUT HIM.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.957
AND I WANT JABBAR
TO HAVE THAT.

39:13.070 --> 39:15.038
I DON'T WANNA BE RATIONAL.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.414
I WANNA BE IRRATIONAL.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.659
I WANNA COME WITH YOU
TO NEW YORK RIGHT NOW,

39:18.770 --> 39:21.147
GET IN THE CAB,
BUY A TICKET, AND GO.

39:24.390 --> 39:27.871
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

39:30.810 --> 39:33.631
- JASMINE,
YOU ARE MY FAMILY.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.716
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
RIGHT NOW?

39:41.820 --> 39:46.689
- UH, I'M THINKING
THAT...

39:46.790 --> 39:49.065
YOU'RE A CONSTANT SURPRISE.

39:53.350 --> 39:56.148
[both chuckle]

40:02.530 --> 40:04.418
- BRING IT OUTSIDE.

40:04.540 --> 40:07.179
HEY. HEY, THERE.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.222
- [laughs]
- LOOK AT THIS KID.

40:09.330 --> 40:10.399
LIKE THE GHOST
OF CATFISH HUNTER, MA.

40:10.510 --> 40:12.842
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE TIME.
COME ON.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.120
- HEY, HEY.

40:14.230 --> 40:17.165
- PITCHING
THE FRESNO FASTBALL.

40:17.270 --> 40:19.852
IT'S DREW HOLT.

40:22.660 --> 40:24.890
[car door opens]

40:34.530 --> 40:36.327
- CAMILLE.

40:36.430 --> 40:38.466
CAMILLE.
- WHAT?

40:38.570 --> 40:40.879
- IT'S THE BOY'S TRYOUT.

40:40.990 --> 40:43.914
- WELL, YOU GO TO THE TRYOUT,
THEN.

40:44.020 --> 40:46.432
I'M STAYING HERE.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.189
THEY CAN COME BACK AFTER,
AND I'LL MAKE THEM LUNCH.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.780
THEY CAN TELL ME ABOUT IT.

40:50.890 --> 40:52.232
- I'D LIKE US
TO GO TOGETHER.

40:52.340 --> 40:55.138
- WELL,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

40:57.900 --> 40:59.583
- GOD DAMN IT.

40:59.690 --> 41:02.341
NOW, LOOK, I WANT YOU BACK.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.553
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

41:04.660 --> 41:10.348
AND I JUST HAVE TO HAVE
SOME ROOM...

41:10.460 --> 41:12.348
TO FIND OUT WHO I AM.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.631
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.

41:14.740 --> 41:18.289
I LOVE BEING A MOTHER.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.628
AND FOR A GOOD DEAL
OF THE TIME,

41:19.750 --> 41:21.149
I LOVED BEING A WIFE.

41:21.270 --> 41:25.058
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE
I GOT SWALLOWED UP SOMEWHERE.

41:25.170 --> 41:27.479
AND THAT'S WHY YOU DID
WHAT YOU DID.

41:29.970 --> 41:33.133
YOU LOOKED AT ME
AND YOU COULDN'T SEE ME ANYMORE.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.128
- I SEE YOU NOW.

41:35.250 --> 41:37.627
- BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.115
CAMILLE.

41:42.220 --> 41:45.144
I WANNA SPEND...

41:45.260 --> 41:49.014
THE REST OF THE TIME
THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER

41:49.120 --> 41:53.250
MAKING OUR LIVES GOOD.

41:53.370 --> 41:57.431
I'M GONNA SING NOW.

41:57.540 --> 41:58.541
- OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- YEAH.

41:58.650 --> 42:01.756
- YOU ARE NOT.
OH--OH--

42:01.860 --> 42:03.646
- YEAH.
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, ZEEK.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.273
[plucking chord]

42:05.380 --> 42:08.349
- WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I'M FEELING FINE

42:11.140 --> 42:14.075
I GOT SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL ON MY MIND

42:17.050 --> 42:21.282
THERE'S A PRETTY GIRL
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

42:23.640 --> 42:27.508
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I'M INTO SOMETHING GOOD

42:30.720 --> 42:34.235
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I'M INTO SOMETHING GOOD

42:36.170 --> 42:39.401
SHE'S THE KIND OF GIRL
WHO'S NOT TOO SHY

42:42.280 --> 42:46.319
AND I CAN TELL THAT
I'M HER KIND OF GUY

42:48.080 --> 42:52.119
SHE DANCED REAL CLOSE
TO ME LIKE I KNEW SHE WOULD

42:54.880 --> 42:58.941
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I'M INTO SOMETHING GOOD

43:01.300 --> 43:03.268
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I'M INTO SOMETHING GOOD
