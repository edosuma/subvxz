WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:05.773
95... 96...

00:05.806 --> 00:08.176
97... 98...

00:08.209 --> 00:09.477
No peeking, Dash.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.212
I wasn't.
99...

00:11.245 --> 00:12.413
LARA VEGA:
There were three of them.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.614
Okay.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.249
The female, Agatha,

00:15.283 --> 00:17.318
and the twins, Arthur and Dash.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.686
(laughing)

00:18.719 --> 00:20.621
They were the children
of drug addicts,

00:20.654 --> 00:23.191
brain-dead from the day
that they were born.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.760
At first, the doctors thought
they'd die that way.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.362
Children!

00:28.396 --> 00:29.797
But a group of scientists
saved them

00:29.830 --> 00:31.599
with an experimental therapy.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.567
It gave them back their minds

00:33.601 --> 00:36.737
and, for a little while,
a childhood.

00:36.770 --> 00:40.408
It also gave them
something else-- a gift.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.243
DR. HINEMAN: Precognitive
ability, blind study.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.711
Tuesday, October 2.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.779
Test subjects
Dashiell, Arthur, Agatha.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.448
(over intercom):
Okay, children.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.818
Torlaksen...
Red...
27.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.654
Sanchez...
Yellow...
81.

00:53.687 --> 00:57.225
Hineman...
Blue...
66.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.327
VEGA:
They could see things.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.396
Little things about to happen
all around them.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.731
But one thing stood out.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.199
Unbelievable.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.600
Who's got another deck?
(loud thud)

01:06.634 --> 01:08.836
No! Please!

01:08.869 --> 01:10.238
Don't!

01:10.271 --> 01:11.572
Down on your knees!

01:11.605 --> 01:13.341
Let's see
that pretty smile,

01:13.374 --> 01:14.642
bitch!
It's happening again.
Get them sedated.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.411
(Agatha wailing)

01:17.445 --> 01:19.380
(overlapping chatter)

01:20.314 --> 01:21.682
Can you see?

01:21.715 --> 01:24.352
WOMAN:
Let's see that pretty smile,
bitch.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.786
See what, dear?

01:26.887 --> 01:29.457
Murder.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.692
VEGA:
The scientists realized
they were seeing

01:31.725 --> 01:33.494
every murder
within a hundred miles

01:33.527 --> 01:35.296
days before they happened.

01:35.329 --> 01:39.167
And that was the last they saw
of the outside world.

01:39.167 --> 01:42.170
The government took them away,

01:42.170 --> 01:44.272
code-named them
the Precognitives,

01:44.305 --> 01:46.440
and hooked their brains up
to machines.

01:46.474 --> 01:50.644
They called it
the Precrime program.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.280
It took hundreds of killers
off the streets

01:52.313 --> 01:54.515
and saved thousands of lives,

01:54.548 --> 01:56.184
but it cost them their own.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.219
They never had a chance
to grow up.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.388
They formed no memories,

02:00.421 --> 02:02.256
except the visions
that they saw.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.757
Until it ended.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.793
Precrime was abolished,

02:05.826 --> 02:08.596
and the Precogs were sent off
to an undisclosed location,

02:08.629 --> 02:10.731
to hide them from the world.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.701
But they just couldn't hide
forever.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.204
(people laughing, chattering)

02:24.812 --> 02:26.514
MALE VOICE:
You win!

02:28.549 --> 02:29.683
Anything else?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.822
You're gonna need a mop.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.524
What?
(grunts)

02:36.557 --> 02:37.858
(patrons exclaiming)

02:37.891 --> 02:40.394
PATRON:
Sorry about that.

02:40.428 --> 02:43.264
(gasping)

02:43.297 --> 02:43.797
Hey.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.234
Ah...

02:46.267 --> 02:47.668
Are you okay?
I gotta go.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.937
(panting)

02:52.005 --> 02:53.641
(exhales)

02:57.711 --> 02:58.879
8:42.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.348
40 minutes.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.534
Bartlet Plaza.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.638
We live in an age of progress,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.774
but since Precrime ended,
we've gone backwards.

03:26.807 --> 03:30.478
FEMALE VOICE: Fare collected.
Fare collected. Fare collected.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.947
Fare denied.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.586
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:38.619 --> 03:40.621
Please stand clear of the doors.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.363
You look stressed, man.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.532
Try one of Hart's new
Totally Baked Goods.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.001
MALE VOICE:
This car is headed
to Bartlet Plaza, city center.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.503
Please make your
onboard transfers now.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.555
(people chattering)

04:21.929 --> 04:23.597
(drumming)

04:30.871 --> 04:33.641
As mayor, my Hawk-Eye system
will change all of that.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.776
As soon as Precrime ended...

04:47.655 --> 04:51.892
FEMALE VOICE:
To your right is Bartlet Plaza,
established in 2022...

04:51.925 --> 04:53.994
(panting)

05:02.970 --> 05:04.805
(yells)

05:14.047 --> 05:15.983
Oh, no... No, no...

05:26.560 --> 05:29.597
(panting)

05:29.630 --> 05:31.432
(stopwatch beeping)
No, no!

05:34.134 --> 05:36.637
(glass shatters, woman screams)

05:36.670 --> 05:37.971
(crowd screaming, shouting)

05:38.005 --> 05:39.640
(exhales)
MAN:
Help! Police!

05:39.673 --> 05:40.808
WOMAN:
Did you hear that?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.417
VEGA: How about
a little thinking music?

05:49.417 --> 05:52.553
AKEELA:
Uniforms already
ran the room. No DNA.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.588
Too many signs of struggle
for a suicide,

05:54.622 --> 05:57.157
but neighbors claim
they didn't hear a thing.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.793
And don't even ask me
about the hallway cameras.
Let me guess.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.895
Out of service.

06:01.929 --> 06:05.899
Yep, so I have no face-recs,
no eye-dentiscans.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.101
To what do we
owe the honor, V?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.503
I thought this
was Blake's case.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.638
I needed some air.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.706
Oh, lucky you.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.908
This perp left the window open.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.109
What's the Open Vistas Center?

06:16.143 --> 06:18.779
Some sort of neuro-rehab.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.913
Our victim was a nurse.
We're running it.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.149
Give me some room.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.151
Let's play this through.

06:24.184 --> 06:27.020
The victim comes home,
she chains the door,

06:27.054 --> 06:29.156
she goes to hang her coat
but she misses.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.758
She's in a hurry.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.160
Packing.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.928
But then someone
kicks in the door.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.096
Signs of struggle.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.700
She confronts him.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.134
He pushes her down.

06:41.835 --> 06:42.636
Huh.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.110
She defends herself.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.683
She has the path to get away,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.685
but she doesn't take it.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.621
She goes for him instead.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.494
She lets it happen.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.895
Why?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.798
Our victim
was protecting someone.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.834
Can you believe we used to stop
this stuff before it happened?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.603
(sighs)

07:15.636 --> 07:17.605
Unfortunately, Precrime was
way before our time, girl.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.740
Now all we do

07:19.773 --> 07:22.042
is mop up messes.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.911
Who was she protecting?

07:27.915 --> 07:30.751
What, you think our perp
made himself a sandwich?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.186
Not unless he's still
in kindergarten.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.722
Lenses, show me infrared.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.132
What is it?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.201
(gasps)

07:52.873 --> 07:55.976
OFFICER:
Folks, you gotta
stay back after here.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.745
We ran her eye-dents.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.613
The victim was her mother.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.014
I'm the first person you call

08:01.048 --> 08:02.683
the second you track down
her family.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.884
PARAMEDIC:
Sure thing, Detective.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.980
(gasps)

08:36.617 --> 08:37.785
Who knows about the Precogs?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.286
It stands for "Precognitives."

08:39.319 --> 08:42.055
Their powers started
when they were just children,

08:42.089 --> 08:44.792
even younger than you are now.
Their names and faces

08:44.825 --> 08:46.894
were kept secret
from the public.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.796
The police would use
what they saw,

08:48.829 --> 08:50.130
their future visions,

08:50.163 --> 08:52.099
to stop murderers
before they struck.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.300
Oh...

08:53.333 --> 08:55.235
Any questions so far?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.070
STUDENT:
Can they, like,
see people naked?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.072
(students giggling)

08:59.106 --> 09:01.274
MALE VOICE (over P.A.):
The Precrime program
was abolished

09:01.308 --> 09:02.743
for their own protection.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.712
(announcement continues
indistinctly)

09:07.881 --> 09:10.818
MALE VOICE 2:
Welcome to Judiciary Plaza.
Please be advised

09:10.851 --> 09:14.622
all public areas are subject
to facial scan surveillance.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.624
(announcement continues
indistinctly)

09:24.798 --> 09:27.367
Hey, hold it!
Hands where I can see 'em.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.368
I have something for you.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.003
Slowly.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.041
(grunts in pain)

09:38.378 --> 09:39.847
"1313."

09:39.880 --> 09:42.015
Where did you get this?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.352
I have to go.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.754
Who are you?
I have to go!

09:46.787 --> 09:48.355
You need to catch him.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.123
(both grunt)

09:52.860 --> 09:54.662
It's only temporary.
Sorry.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.673
What?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.822
Shouldn't you be out
collecting maglev tickets, Vega?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.223
I heard this was your case,
Blake.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.424
Figured that
I'd solve it for you,

10:24.457 --> 10:26.093
so that you could
take the credit

10:26.126 --> 10:27.427
and land the big promotion,
like the last time.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.996
It's called
delegating.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.397
That's what
lieutenants do.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.733
I'll take notes.
You should,

10:32.766 --> 10:34.267
'cause you'll make
a great lieutenant...

10:34.301 --> 10:36.036
once I'm your captain.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.140
But I don't need you
on this one, Vega,

10:40.173 --> 10:42.042
because I have
a lead.

10:48.448 --> 10:52.085
It turns out Open Vistas
is no ordinary rehab.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.421
They specialize
in Marks syndrome,

10:54.454 --> 10:57.691
a brain disorder common
to former Precrime prisoners.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.026
Halo burn.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.194
So you're saying
my victim was a nurse

11:01.228 --> 11:02.763
in a building
full of killers?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.932
I'm saying my victim,

11:04.965 --> 11:06.867
and future-killers,
technically,

11:06.900 --> 11:09.302
the city set them free after
Precrime was abolished.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.938
Oh, that doesn't
make them innocent.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.139
These people
would be murderers.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.306
Yeah, but the trick is,

11:13.340 --> 11:15.743
which one are we looking for?

11:15.743 --> 11:17.978
We have no DNA,
no face to run.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.882
What if we did?

11:21.915 --> 11:25.052
Some weirdo gave me this
in the plaza and then ran off.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.387
Like an informant?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.356
We should run point comp.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.424
And by "we," you mean "me."

11:31.458 --> 11:32.760
It's my tip.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.762
On my case.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.911
We have a match.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.380
VEGA: Sahm Adrangi, an
illegal bioweapons dealer

11:53.413 --> 11:55.248
with priors for
clarity possession

11:55.282 --> 11:57.250
until Precrime nailed him
for the future-murder

11:57.284 --> 11:58.852
of a federal agent.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.187
And look how he
planned to do it.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.454
By throwing him out the window.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.424
Well, at least
he has a brand.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.227
Eye-dents put his last location

12:07.260 --> 12:08.929
at a steel farm in the Sprawl.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.230
Oh, don't you want to wait

12:10.263 --> 12:12.165
in your big new office,
Lieutenant?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.801
Nice try.
(laughs)

12:15.869 --> 12:18.171
ROBOT:
Stand clear, stand clear.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.993
Sahm Adrangi!

12:40.027 --> 12:41.862
Do not move.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.264
Drop your weapon!

12:44.297 --> 12:46.133
Peekaboo, bitch.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.201
Vega, stand down.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.436
Let's face it, Will.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.338
You're not a closer.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.473
You...
ROBOT: Stand clear.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.142
You have no idea what's coming.
What are you talking about?

12:55.175 --> 12:56.443
Stand clear.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.945
And you never will!
Don't do it!

12:57.978 --> 12:59.012
No!

12:59.046 --> 13:00.447
Stand clear.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.925
Well, I would have closed him
differently, but...

13:11.959 --> 13:13.393
okay.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.095
AGATHA:
Dash, listen to yourself.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.864
When they set us free,
we promised

13:16.864 --> 13:18.098
not to intervene
in their affairs.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.433
I am being careful.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.069
Is that what you call
racing to a crime scene

13:22.102 --> 13:23.904
like some kind of action hero?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.873
You think
I can't see it, Dash?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.574
I don't want to know
what you see, Agatha.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.277
If you go to the police again,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.179
it will be a mistake.
She was a mother!

13:32.212 --> 13:33.613
Her daughter
must be as young

13:33.646 --> 13:34.915
as we were when it started.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.583
When they...
Is that what this is?

13:36.616 --> 13:39.452
You think you can fix the past
by meddling with the future?

13:39.486 --> 13:42.589
Suppose you made it there
in time-- what then?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.958
Would you confront the killer?
Fight him off?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.060
Or tell the police who you are,
what you are?

13:47.094 --> 13:48.996
You know how much
I see out here.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.198
If I could just get
to one in time...

13:51.231 --> 13:52.499
You can't.
You know that.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.367
Your gift is incomplete
without your brother.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.537
There are people
who will use you, Dash.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.339
I won't let them.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.374
You're so haunted by other
people's futures, you forget

14:01.408 --> 14:03.410
the only future
you cannot see is your own.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.278
But I can and I'm warning you...

14:05.312 --> 14:06.479
Stop.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.049
Come home...

14:09.082 --> 14:11.284
where you belong.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.253
The detective
that you go to...

14:13.286 --> 14:14.922
I'm hanging up!

14:14.922 --> 14:16.589
...she will only
use you like a toy...

14:25.365 --> 14:27.367
AKEELA:
Hey, nice job back there.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.469
But I thought the whole goal
was to bring them back alive.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.138
Now she tells me.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.572
It was a suicide.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.207
He didn't want to talk.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.376
My guess is,
he had an accomplice.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.978
What about your tipster?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.246
Did you get a look at him?

14:39.279 --> 14:40.313
Only in disguise.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.116
Then he jabbed me with this.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.052
And then ran off.
Temporary paralytic enzyme.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.188
Disguises your face by turning
the muscles into mush.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.390
Turns out it works
on your legs, too.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.059
Uh, well, whoever your guy is,

14:52.092 --> 14:54.361
he managed to dodge all
the surveillance feeds.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.163
But I did pull this
off a selfie drone.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.432
BLAKE:
Ooh, nice photo bomb.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.334
AKEELA:
Yeah, it gets better.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.635
I ran the DNA we found
in the possessions...

15:02.669 --> 15:04.104
No criminal record?
No record at all.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.239
This guy is a ghost.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.607
Yeah, with one
creepy-ass imagination.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.675
Or maybe not.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.712
Check this out.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.082
There's a dozen
murder drawings in this book.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.117
I bet you each one
is a real crime.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.685
Maybe he hacked the database.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.253
No one hacks my database.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.621
Okay, so that's out.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.223
VEGA:
A watcher.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.128
Someone who grows up without
any human interaction.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.230
Always on the
outside looking in.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.664
All right, let's grab
the crime scene feeds.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.066
Search for loiterers.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.734
Distressed or anti-social
body language.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.569
Aye, aye.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.007
(various voices
talking over one another)

15:44.744 --> 15:47.147
See anyone you recognize?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.018
Nope. Nada.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.585
Well, whoever
your guy is,

15:52.619 --> 15:54.021
he's living off the grid.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.588
Sounds like a trip
to the Sprawl.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.490
Vega, ride along?

15:57.524 --> 15:58.725
No, you go ahead, Blake.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.127
I've got tickets
to collect.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.165
You're letting him go alone?

16:05.198 --> 16:06.733
I call that delegating.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.735
AKEELA:
Okay, next karaoke night,

16:08.768 --> 16:10.737
you're gonna have to tell me
what happened between you two.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.042
(quiet laugh)
The watcher.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.543
Search this face.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.712
Last location.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.250
Bingo!

16:23.283 --> 16:24.684
Order up!

16:24.717 --> 16:27.054
One cheeseburger and a
hot dog for table five.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.656
(laughter)

16:29.689 --> 16:32.325
(indistinct chatter)

16:33.560 --> 16:35.128
Ooh, French fries!

16:35.162 --> 16:36.729
May I?
Um...

16:36.763 --> 16:39.166
No, stick around.
I like company.

16:39.199 --> 16:42.069
Uh, no, I was just about to...
Can you believe these
used to be unhealthy?

16:42.069 --> 16:44.171
Thank God for
the genetic revolution.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.605
Do you always get the munchies

16:45.638 --> 16:46.606
after watching women die?

16:46.639 --> 16:47.607
What?

16:47.640 --> 16:48.608
That tip you gave me.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.710
This look like your friend?

16:50.743 --> 16:53.146
The murderer-- you got him?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.548
That's one way to put it.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.550
I wasn't quite sure
where to send the medal.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.585
For me? Oh!

16:58.618 --> 17:00.520
Oh, no, thank you.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.424
Okay, let's just skip past
the part where you play dumb

17:04.457 --> 17:05.792
and I threaten to bring you in.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.428
"In"? No! No, no, no!
I'm fine right here.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.097
These drawings
put you at the scene

17:10.130 --> 17:11.431
of at least a dozen murders.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.765
You're telling me
that's just bad luck?

17:12.799 --> 17:14.534
No, no, you don't understand.
I am just a...

17:14.567 --> 17:16.269
What, a lookout?
Yes... No.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.505
I-I mean I only see them.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.772
Oh, so you like to watch.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.108
"Like to watch"?

17:21.108 --> 17:23.510
No...
(gasps)

17:23.543 --> 17:24.777
I need air. I need to go.
I need to leave.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.579
Sit down!

17:26.613 --> 17:27.814
Just breathe, okay?

17:27.847 --> 17:29.349
(short breath)
I get it.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.151
You're not a killer.
I can see that.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.285
You can?

17:32.319 --> 17:34.154
You came to me, but why?

17:34.187 --> 17:36.189
Are you in too deep?
Are you afraid of someone?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.824
I can help you.
Just tell me what's going on.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.492
Not now. Not now. Not now...
Not now what?

17:39.526 --> 17:40.760
Please, you need to let me...

17:40.793 --> 17:42.529
(gasps)

17:42.562 --> 17:44.497
(groaning)

17:46.199 --> 17:48.568
Can you see?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.370
See what?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.405
Murder.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.840
(gasps)

17:53.873 --> 17:55.375
Call an ambulance!

17:55.408 --> 17:56.809
Someone call an ambulance!

18:01.814 --> 18:03.850
(quietly):
Help.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.219
MAN:
...the city of the future...

18:06.253 --> 18:07.620
(gasps)

18:07.654 --> 18:09.889
No! I need to go.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.658
(crowd clamoring)

18:11.691 --> 18:14.394
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.299
You're one of them.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.602
Please.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.475
VEGA:
No wonder you're
not in the database.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.543
You're one of the twins.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.779
Dash.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.248
Our records were erased

18:35.282 --> 18:37.450
after Precrime ended,
and then we were sent away.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.552
The things you see...

18:39.586 --> 18:40.620
There are people
who would use us.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.488
But you came back-- why?

18:41.521 --> 18:42.489
Are you going

18:42.522 --> 18:43.523
to bring me in?

18:43.556 --> 18:44.724
Shouldn't you be telling me?

18:44.757 --> 18:46.793
That would make things easier.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.428
I can't see my future,

18:48.461 --> 18:49.429
only others.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.198
But that fit back there--

18:51.198 --> 18:52.832
you saw a murder,
didn't you?

18:52.865 --> 18:54.334
I can't be doing this.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.302
Who's the victim?
Give me a name.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.769
I don't know, please.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.571
Don't lie to me.
In Precrime, they got names.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.507
We were a hive then, linked.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.309
It's different now.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.211
Agatha, her gift is stronger.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.845
But Arthur and me...

19:05.878 --> 19:07.347
we are like...

19:07.380 --> 19:09.582
like one mind split in two.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.485
He gets the names.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.654
I only see what happens.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.955
So, where is he?
Where is Arthur?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.225
I need to go.
You have my drawings.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.593
There are murders in there
the police haven't solved yet.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.940
I'm done mopping up the messes.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.642
I can't help!

19:35.675 --> 19:37.410
I told you.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.779
I keep trying
and I don't see enough.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.448
Then let me help you.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.350
You found me for a reason.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.386
That little girl--

19:46.419 --> 19:47.820
you know what it's like,
don't you?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.790
Losing everything.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.792
Growing up without a mother.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.962
That's why you came to me.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.365
That's why you
put yourself at risk.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.800
If anyone finds out,
finds me...

20:00.833 --> 20:02.802
I won't let that happen.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.472
I can't keep getting close.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.739
Neither can I.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.408
I'm tired of picking up
the pieces.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.877
Just once, I need to stop one
before it happens.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.212
Don't you?

20:26.493 --> 20:27.927
(indistinct chatter)

20:32.799 --> 20:34.267
MAN:
But since Precrime ended...

20:34.301 --> 20:36.703
(man continues indistinctly)

20:36.736 --> 20:38.338
Wait.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.906
This is the man you saw?

20:39.939 --> 20:42.509
You know him?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.877
Yeah.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.979
MAN 2:
Vote for a better future.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.315
Vote Peter Van Eyck for mayor.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.816
He's pretty hard to miss.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.518
Peter Van Eyck was
a deputy chief

20:51.551 --> 20:53.553
of Precrime--
he has to have enemies.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.488
Someone's after his wife.
It could be for revenge.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.624
Wait, he worked in Precrime?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.626
Relax-- you three
were in isolation, right?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.428
No one ever saw your face.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.629
So, what do we do?

21:02.662 --> 21:03.796
How do we save her?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.432
You let me do the talking.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.334
Any signal you pick up,
you let me know.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.336
Can't we just warn them?

21:09.369 --> 21:10.970
Sure, I'll tell them
that you're a Precog

21:11.003 --> 21:12.772
and that you saw it in a
vision-- that's a great idea.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.342
No!
Look, this is
an investigation now.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.043
You gave us a victim.
Now we need to find out

21:17.076 --> 21:19.011
who plans to kill her.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.480
Sorry to have you wait.
We're running our

21:20.513 --> 21:21.981
two-minute offense.
Peter Van Eyck.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.550
My wife Olivia.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.784
And this is Jack.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.018
It was a long day on the trail

21:26.052 --> 21:27.019
for the little guy.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.356
(gasps)

21:29.356 --> 21:30.490
Oh!

21:30.523 --> 21:31.824
(chuckles)

21:31.858 --> 21:33.860
Uh, he has a cold.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.395
Oh, we appreciate the warning.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.763
Keep your distance, honey.

21:36.796 --> 21:37.897
We need you healthy for
tomorrow's rally.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.699
Tomorrow?

21:39.732 --> 21:41.968
On the mall?
She shouldn't go to that.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.970
I am starting
to like these people, Peter.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.472
But I'm calling it a day

21:45.505 --> 21:47.774
for Jack-- your
staff can blame me.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.075
Can you say bye-bye?

21:49.108 --> 21:50.577
Bye.
(both laugh)

21:50.610 --> 21:51.878
Bye.

21:51.911 --> 21:55.548
So, what can I do
for you, Detectives?

21:55.582 --> 21:57.717
"Detectives."

21:57.750 --> 21:59.519
Like I told your aide, uh,

21:59.552 --> 22:01.821
we're following a lead
about tomorrow's rally.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.456
Have you had any
recent threats?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.525
Not that I'm aware of,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.860
I was in law enforcement
for almost ten years.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.696
Yeah, uh, Precrime
was what made me want

22:09.729 --> 22:12.031
to become a cop
to begin with.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.034
Just my luck, it disbanded
before I finished the academy.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.569
Well, it was a good program
despite its flaws.

22:16.603 --> 22:17.904
Now it's time to move on.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.772
My new system...
Oh, Hawk-Eye.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.774
Yes, you can't
miss the ads.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.644
Ambient surveillance,
algorithmic sweeps.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.646
Predictive policing
relying on hard data,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.749
not the psychic instinct
of some genetic freaks.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.784
Freaks?

22:31.818 --> 22:33.119
So, uh, about
those threats.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.654
Well, my security team
monitors all cyber traffic

22:34.687 --> 22:36.022
relating to the campaign.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.657
Ashby will get you sorted.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.991
Right this way.
Thank you, Detectives.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.026
You lose by a landslide.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.428
I'm sorry?
Hmm?
Nothing.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.065
Can you really see
that far ahead?

22:46.098 --> 22:48.134
No.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.136
ASHBY: We run a constant passive
search on social media,

22:50.169 --> 22:52.572
city surveillance,
even purchase patterns.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.574
These incidents have all been
checked and disregarded.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.575
Stop.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.576
Open Vistas.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.777
It's him.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.111
Adrangi.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.647
You know this man?

23:00.680 --> 23:01.981
We met briefly.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.116
ASHBY: The system
flagged his username

23:04.150 --> 23:06.118
for running a Web search
on the security parameters

23:06.152 --> 23:09.121
at tomorrow's rally,
but dismissed the threat.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.724
Help yourselves.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.693
Dismissed? Why?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.027
He's a murderer.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.029
Because Adrangi
killed himself

23:17.063 --> 23:19.098
three hours before
that search was run.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.703
Open Vistas Treatment Center.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.472
Every person here was once
a convicted

23:25.472 --> 23:27.507
Precrime killer.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.975
One of them obviously
didn't learn his lesson.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.510
I remember them.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.479
James Lanman.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.746
Allison Chen.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.047
Daniel Carmy.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.851
Hey.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.019
Earth to Dash.

23:40.052 --> 23:43.122
I did this to them.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.991
No, you stopped them
from committing murders.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.526
It's not your fault

23:46.559 --> 23:48.127
the containment system
fried their minds.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.063
(classical music plays)

23:54.667 --> 23:55.935
Can I help you?

23:56.903 --> 23:58.871
Maybe.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.608
Did you know the man
in this bed, Mr. Adrangi?

24:01.641 --> 24:04.544
Only for a few weeks, since they
moved my father to this ward.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.212
Why?

24:06.245 --> 24:08.748
He threw a woman out a window,
then committed suicide.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.517
Okay.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.118
During this part,
I work alone.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.786
WOMAN:
That's awful.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.788
It might not have been
all he was planning,

24:15.822 --> 24:17.056
and he may have had help.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.057
Is this his?

24:18.090 --> 24:19.058
I think so.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.067
And your father
had access to it?

24:28.100 --> 24:30.002
Well, I suppose.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.939
This is the device that ran
the search on Van Eyck.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.874
Van Eyck?

24:34.907 --> 24:36.242
VEGA: Former deputy chief
of Precrime.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.978
He put your father away,
didn't he?

24:40.246 --> 24:42.214
For something that he never did.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.983
Or maybe didn't have
the chance to.

24:46.653 --> 24:50.256
The Precogs saw him murder
his wife, my mother.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.294
But he loved her
more than anything.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.864
The police took him anyway,
put him in a halo.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.266
By the time
Precrime ended

25:00.299 --> 25:03.770
and they let him out,
she'd died of grief,

25:03.803 --> 25:05.972
and he...

25:06.005 --> 25:07.840
his brain was so scarred
by the containment

25:07.874 --> 25:09.275
that he forgot her name.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.944
Is that why you drink?
Excuse me?

25:11.978 --> 25:14.814
He means, that must
be hard on you.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.049
Can we see him?

25:17.083 --> 25:19.719
This way.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.122
"Is that
why you drink?"

25:23.155 --> 25:24.657
You said tell you
when I saw something.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.593
Are you familiar with
the concept of a whisper?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.264
WOMAN: Ask what you want
about Adrangi,

25:32.298 --> 25:33.966
but don't expect much.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.935
These days, my father
only cares about his hobby.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.307
You have visitors, Dad.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.710
Get down from there.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.712
Go easy, will you?

25:45.745 --> 25:48.147
Always.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.016
So what do you see?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.018
Is this the guy
from your... you know?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.186
I didn't see his face.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.287
These people are here
to talk to you.

25:55.321 --> 25:56.989
About Olivia Van Eyck.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.725
Van Eyck?
(whispering):
You shouldn't stand there.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.059
Not familiar
with that bird.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.228
You shouldn't
stand there.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.230
Van Dam's vanga,
on the other hand.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.132
Native to Madagascar.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.767
VEGA:
She's not a bird.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.769
She's a politician's wife,
but you knew that.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.639
I really wouldn't stand...

26:12.672 --> 26:14.306
Really?

26:14.340 --> 26:16.308
You told me to whisper.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.178
Haven't you seen enough?

26:19.211 --> 26:21.247
Actually, I'm just
getting started.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.149
We found Adrangi's pad
beside your bed.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.685
Someone was researching Van
Eyck's security arrangements.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.987
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

26:28.020 --> 26:30.990
Research?

26:31.023 --> 26:32.324
No.

26:32.358 --> 26:35.662
My work is here,
my life's work.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.663
Pigeons?

26:36.696 --> 26:37.897
WOMAN:
Passenger pigeons.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.900
The species went extinct
150 years ago,

26:40.933 --> 26:42.902
until my father
brought them back.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.904
He used to be a brilliant man.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.239
I still have
my moments, darling.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.208
On the clear days.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.359
DASH: How does he do that?
WOMAN: Brain-computer interface.

27:07.393 --> 27:10.329
Wireless signals to an implant
embedded in the skull.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.136
They're all you have left.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.705
Precrime took
your life away,

27:18.738 --> 27:20.406
and you blame Van Eyck
for that, don't you?

27:20.439 --> 27:23.342
What?!
Is that why you plan
to kill him at tomorrow's rally?

27:23.375 --> 27:24.443
What? No.
That's crazy,
you can't...

27:24.476 --> 27:26.012
You know
what I think?

27:26.045 --> 27:27.279
I think you and Adrangi
planned this together,

27:27.313 --> 27:28.347
but then some poor
nurse found out,

27:28.380 --> 27:29.882
so he threw her
out of a window.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.917
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:30.950 --> 27:31.918
Of course you don't.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.419
MAN:
I'm innocent.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.354
He's gonna jump.
I've always been innocent.

27:35.387 --> 27:36.355
You need to arrest him.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.456
MAN: Arrest?!
What?!

27:37.489 --> 27:39.792
No!

27:39.826 --> 27:41.260
VEGA: Hey!
Dad!

27:57.143 --> 27:58.945
VEGA:
Stop!

28:13.225 --> 28:14.761
I'm sorry.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.062
Did I mess up?

28:16.095 --> 28:18.230
What makes you say that?

28:22.935 --> 28:25.437
ANNOUNCER: The Simpsons
Season 75 Spectacular,

28:25.471 --> 28:27.506
streaming only on Fox.
AKEELA: No hits yet,

28:27.539 --> 28:29.508
but I'll let you know when
Rutledge pops up on the grid.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.377
Where'd you get
this lead, anyway?

28:31.410 --> 28:33.379
There's nothing in the system.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.281
New CI I'm working with.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.283
Good instincts.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.819
Just needs a little work
on people skills.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.821
And keep this
between us, will you?

28:41.854 --> 28:43.489
You mean away from Blake?

28:43.522 --> 28:45.992
One of these days, you're gonna
have to tell me everything.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.493
If you want details,
you should ask Blake.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.796
He's really good at telling
stories about himself.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.101
Oh, looks like we're
interrupting something.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.869
Got to go.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.504
Is this your boyfriend?

28:58.537 --> 29:02.441
No, this is Dash, my colleague.

29:02.474 --> 29:03.976
He's consulting on a case.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.077
For the police.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.946
This once.
BOY: Sure.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.147
"Colleague."

29:12.184 --> 29:14.153
WOMAN:
When I was your age,

29:14.186 --> 29:16.322
we had this thing
called Tinder.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.857
Mom!
What?

29:17.890 --> 29:19.525
It's how I met
your father.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.560
You can't spend your whole
life at the precinct, Lara.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.562
Anyway, he's cute.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.997
Staying for dinner?

29:25.031 --> 29:26.966
Yes, we're ordering Chinese.

29:26.999 --> 29:27.967
We are?!

29:28.000 --> 29:29.836
No, we're not.

29:29.869 --> 29:30.903
I'm cooking.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.909
Who wants Chinese?

29:41.280 --> 29:42.248
Vinyl.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.983
My dad's collection.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.852
Turned me on to the oldies.

29:45.885 --> 29:48.187
* Right, I should've known
you were bad news... *

29:48.220 --> 29:50.522
I know this one.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.525
"Trouble" by Iggy Azalea.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.062
Produced by Invisible Men
and Salt Wives.

29:56.095 --> 29:58.530
We had a lot of downtime
on the island.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.600
Is the island where they
sent you after Precrime?

30:01.633 --> 30:04.003
Is that your father?

30:06.105 --> 30:08.340
Yes.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.876
He was a cop, too.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.411
He was killed.

30:13.946 --> 30:17.249
Long time ago.
I'm sorry.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.952
Is that why you wanted
to be a part of Precrime?

30:19.986 --> 30:22.388
Well, it's a pretty good reason
to join up, don't you think?

30:22.421 --> 30:24.090
We never really had a choice.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.424
Of course.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.463
At least you still have
your mother, your son.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.965
Uh...
(laughs)

30:32.999 --> 30:35.301
Rico? No,
he's-he's not my son.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.635
He's my little brother.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.638
My mom hit 60 and went
off of birth control

30:39.671 --> 30:41.640
and thought that she had
an empty nest to fill,

30:41.673 --> 30:43.642
and then I moved back
next door, so here I am.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.643
You want a drink?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.045
Okay.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.647
They found you
when you were kids, right?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.349
Some doctor somewhere?

30:50.382 --> 30:53.452
When we were 14, they hooked
us up to the machines

30:53.485 --> 30:56.322
and put us in
the milk bath.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.190
That's pretty much the
last thing I remember

30:58.224 --> 30:59.325
for the next decade.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.627
Arthur left the island first.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.163
He's been here
a long time.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.664
If I had lived
through all that,

31:05.697 --> 31:07.967
I would want to get as far
away from here as possible.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.468
But that gets old,

31:09.501 --> 31:11.270
especially when you know
you can be helping people.

31:11.303 --> 31:14.273
I've seen 16 murders
since I got here,

31:14.306 --> 31:16.308
and I couldn't get to
a single one in time.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.644
Can't Arthur help you?

31:18.677 --> 31:20.179
Can he help us?

31:20.212 --> 31:21.680
No.
Why?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.549
Because Arthur only
cares about himself.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.384
And everything
comes at a price.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.386
Dash, that rally is in 12 hours.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.221
Our suspect is in the wind.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.990
We need more.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.691
In Precrime, they could see
inside your head.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.626
They could see
what you see.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.462
What if we still can?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.566
DASH: Wally was our
caretaker in Precrime,

31:40.599 --> 31:42.501
the only real-live
face we ever saw.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.270
(dog yips)

31:44.303 --> 31:46.272
Afterward, he helped transition
us into the new home.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.606
Down, Kanye!

31:47.639 --> 31:49.608
Were you followed?
Quick, get in, get in.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.443
The streets have eyes.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.648
My God, it's really you.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.585
Oh.
So grown up.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.353
So human.

32:01.387 --> 32:02.621
How long have
you been back?

32:02.654 --> 32:04.556
Why didn't you
call sooner?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.558
Been, uh, laying low.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.395
Tell me everything--
your brother, Agatha.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.697
Hey, can you guys
catch up later?
Oh, typical cop.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.699
"Hurry, hurry." I know
my rights, by the way,

32:13.732 --> 32:16.168
in case that contact
lens is still recording.

32:16.202 --> 32:17.469
I'm a homicide cop

32:17.503 --> 32:19.471
using an illegal psychic
to stop a murder.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.040
I'd say we're all
off-road already.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.742
This is Vega.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.578
She's a... colleague.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.649
Can you help us?

32:30.682 --> 32:33.652
They used to say
you were the weak one.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.288
Agatha would get the bigger
picture, Arthur got the names,

32:36.322 --> 32:38.124
you just saw the
bits and pieces,

32:38.157 --> 32:39.725
the little things
the others missed.

32:39.758 --> 32:40.692
Missed?

32:42.494 --> 32:45.297
WALLY: They covered it all
up after the program fell.

32:45.331 --> 32:48.267
Wanted so badly for their
Precogs to be perfect,

32:48.300 --> 32:51.137
they never could accept one
little inconvenient truth.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.704
What truth?

32:52.738 --> 32:54.706
For Precrime to work,
the public needed to believe

32:54.740 --> 32:57.409
that the murders
we saw were destiny,

32:57.443 --> 32:59.411
that people couldn't
change their futures.

32:59.445 --> 33:02.414
The dirty secret was that even
the three Precogs didn't always

33:02.448 --> 33:04.650
see the future in the same way.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.419
Outlier visions.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.255
They were filed
in minority reports.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.457
Yeah, which means the future
isn't set in stone.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.425
(Wally grunts)

33:13.459 --> 33:17.096
A little homemade
neural interface.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.465
Kind of what we used
back in the temple.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.267
Just, uh...

33:21.300 --> 33:23.069
not as perfected.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.703
As in, uh,

33:24.736 --> 33:26.572
a little pain?

33:28.074 --> 33:31.510
Um... maybe a lot.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.418
Here comes a pinch.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.358
(moaning)

33:47.526 --> 33:49.428
What's happening?

33:49.461 --> 33:51.130
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's weaker than I thought.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.634
It's hurting him.
You need to stop.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.603
Don't... stop.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.773
(yelling)

34:01.807 --> 34:04.643
He's all right,
he's all right.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.578
(sighs)

34:08.847 --> 34:10.782
(people groaning)

34:12.218 --> 34:14.120
Look.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.122
It's not just one victim.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.126
It's an attack.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.403
He's back.
Did it work?
What did you see?

34:31.437 --> 34:32.871
Van Eyck isn't the only target.

34:32.904 --> 34:33.872
There's more people
in the crowd.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.507
More?

34:35.541 --> 34:36.875
Looks like Rutledge
is gonna use his formerly

34:36.908 --> 34:38.644
extinct birds
as a delivery system

34:38.677 --> 34:40.379
for some kind
of virus at the rally.

34:40.412 --> 34:41.847
Adrangi was
a bioweapons dealer.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.483
He probably supplied the virus.
We have to stop it.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.318
Can't you get them
to cancel the rally?
With what proof?

34:46.352 --> 34:47.586
Are you ready to walk
into the precinct

34:47.619 --> 34:49.488
and tell them what you saw?
Oh, no.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.357
I can't let this happen.

34:51.390 --> 34:52.424
Then think.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.492
Anything we missed.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.161
A-a detail, a-a location.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.730
We need more.

35:02.401 --> 35:05.571
It's time.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.340
What?

35:08.374 --> 35:12.278
We need to go to Arthur.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.383
VEGA: Nice office
for an estate planner.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.851
I knew this day would come.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.887
I do like surprises, though.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.792
You brought a friend.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.295
Maybe I underestimated
my little brother.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.762
Little?

35:30.796 --> 35:32.298
I thought you were twins.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.832
Older by seven minutes.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.534
Dash was afraid to come out.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.635
I finally had
some peace and quiet.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.937
(chuckles)

35:38.970 --> 35:40.506
You brought a cop?

35:40.539 --> 35:41.640
We can trust her.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.710
Your secret's safe with me.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.545
So that must make you
a crooked cop.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.248
I'm Detective...

35:49.281 --> 35:50.416
Lara Vega.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.883
257 Canzonet Street,

35:51.917 --> 35:53.685
Arlington, Virginia.

35:53.719 --> 35:54.853
Yeah, I heard that you were good

35:54.886 --> 35:55.921
at pulling names
and other details.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.523
Like vital data,

35:57.556 --> 35:59.258
bank accounts,
identities from folks

35:59.291 --> 36:00.926
who are about
to meet a violent end.

36:00.959 --> 36:04.796
How much does that sell for
on the black market?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.798
I didn't say anything.

36:06.832 --> 36:07.933
Agatha used to fight
your battles for you.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.436
I like this better.

36:10.469 --> 36:11.903
What did you see
that Dash didn't?

36:12.971 --> 36:16.342
How much is this gonna cost me?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.944
Conversation for another time.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.552
You were expecting us.

36:26.585 --> 36:29.655
Providence Crossing.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.557
It's an abandoned shopping mall.

36:33.759 --> 36:37.663
A thank you
isn't necessary, Detective.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.265
But how about a drink?

36:39.265 --> 36:40.366
No problem.

36:40.399 --> 36:43.269
I have your number.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.644
*

37:07.493 --> 37:09.761
(buzzing)

37:29.581 --> 37:31.550
Lenses, track drone feeds.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.594
WOMAN:
And now, former
Most Valuable Player

37:42.628 --> 37:46.332
of Super Bowl LXXXVII
for the Washington Red Clouds

37:46.332 --> 37:49.034
and future mayor
of this great city,

37:49.067 --> 37:50.369
Peter Van Eyck!

37:50.402 --> 37:52.003
(crowd cheering)

37:52.037 --> 37:53.639
WOMAN:
Van Eyck for mayor!

37:53.672 --> 37:56.375
WOMAN 2:
We love you, Van Eyck!

37:56.408 --> 37:59.378
VAN EYCK:
Thank you, Edie!

37:59.411 --> 38:01.980
My wife Olivia and I
are glad to be here.

38:02.013 --> 38:05.016
We're grateful and humbled
by this terrific turnout.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.052
(Van Eyck continues
indistinctly)

38:27.506 --> 38:28.674
DASH:
What do you see?

38:28.707 --> 38:30.842
Upstairs.
Come on, we got to move.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.545
(grunts)

38:35.947 --> 38:37.048
But thanks to loving parents

38:37.082 --> 38:38.384
and two older brothers

38:38.384 --> 38:40.552
who toughened me up enough

38:40.586 --> 38:41.853
to play pro football...
MAN: Go Clouds!

38:41.887 --> 38:43.955
I had it good.
Go Clouds!

38:43.989 --> 38:45.757
(crowd cheering)

38:45.791 --> 38:47.726
(Van Eyck's speech
continues faintly)

38:56.034 --> 38:57.769
Mason Rutledge!

38:57.803 --> 38:59.004
Metro PD!

39:09.581 --> 39:10.582
No!

39:15.987 --> 39:17.456
Stay down!

39:17.489 --> 39:19.591
WOMAN:
That's enough!

39:21.860 --> 39:23.695
You're too late.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.132
Why are you doing this?

39:27.165 --> 39:29.635
Van Eyck took our family.

39:29.668 --> 39:32.137
So now we'll take his.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.072
But they're not
the only ones who die.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.807
Our lives aren't
the only ones you ruined.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.613
Put down the gun.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.470
Vega!
(grunts)

40:08.173 --> 40:09.441
The birds.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.979
(crowd cheering)

40:14.012 --> 40:15.914
It won't let me do this.
It's not working.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.687
We need Rutledge.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.888
We need his hand.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.729
MAN:
Van Eyck for mayor!

40:30.762 --> 40:33.665
(crowd cheering)

40:33.699 --> 40:34.766
MAN:
Whoa!

40:34.800 --> 40:36.001
(crowd gasping)

40:36.034 --> 40:38.504
Van Eyck!
Van Eyck!

40:38.537 --> 40:39.838
Yeah.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.808
It's working.
It's working.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.843
They're coming back.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.478
We did it.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.179
(both laughing)

40:49.881 --> 40:50.949
(grunting)

40:53.151 --> 40:55.153
Mason Rutledge, you have
the right to remain silent.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.489
Anything you say...

41:01.259 --> 41:02.528
No!

41:05.764 --> 41:07.232
What the hell did you do?!

41:07.265 --> 41:09.034
He had a knife!
I saw it!

41:20.946 --> 41:22.147
Thank you.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.593
You need to go.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.961
You can't be here.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.062
What? I...

41:37.095 --> 41:38.597
Go.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.703
WOMAN:
Well, you have to believe
in Van Eyck's chances...

41:44.736 --> 41:47.205
VAN EYCK:
I'd like to thank
the brave officers

41:47.238 --> 41:50.308
of the Metro PD who prevented
a threat against my life today.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.310
A threat that would have
never got this far

41:52.343 --> 41:53.912
had the Hawk-Eye system
been in place.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.847
(reporters clamoring)

41:55.881 --> 41:58.684
Thanks for closing
my case without me.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.318
You know, I never did
track down your tipster.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.721
You do this alone?

42:02.754 --> 42:03.989
No.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.624
I didn't.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.325
We did, Blake.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.595
Just you and me.

42:09.595 --> 42:12.698
To give the police the resources

42:12.731 --> 42:16.902
and tools and freedoms
they need to keep us safe.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.184
*

42:39.758 --> 42:41.092
How you doing?

42:41.126 --> 42:42.227
I'm okay.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.862
How about you?

42:43.895 --> 42:45.697
Well, that depends.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.165
So far, we're good.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.834
But there is an investigation.

42:48.867 --> 42:50.636
I'll know more soon.

42:53.104 --> 42:56.041
You saved my life, Dash.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.009
All those people are alive

42:58.043 --> 42:59.645
because of you.

42:59.645 --> 43:02.648
What happens next time?

43:06.885 --> 43:09.688
Shouldn't you be telling me?

43:09.721 --> 43:12.658
(chuckles)

43:21.967 --> 43:24.302
AGATHA:
You know, for months
after they set us free,

43:24.335 --> 43:27.072
I was afraid to close my eyes.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.107
All the death we'd seen, I...

43:29.140 --> 43:31.342
I thought it's all
I'd ever see again.

43:33.745 --> 43:35.113
(insect buzzes)

43:35.146 --> 43:37.015
Next time,
we're doing this at my place.

43:37.048 --> 43:38.817
You know, civilization.

43:38.850 --> 43:41.086
I thought mosquitoes
went extinct.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.188
Did Dash come to you again?

43:43.221 --> 43:45.256
Swung by for a visit.

43:45.290 --> 43:48.794
Find out everything you can
about this detective.

43:48.827 --> 43:50.395
Already on it.
And when I say

43:50.428 --> 43:51.863
"find out,"
I don't mean s...

43:51.897 --> 43:53.331
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.334
You go to your church, Agatha,
I'll go to mine.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.308
Are you still seeing it?

44:06.745 --> 44:08.947
Your vision?

44:08.980 --> 44:11.216
Them taking us again?

44:11.249 --> 44:13.251
If he's a part of this,
like you think,

44:13.284 --> 44:15.286
we got to tell Dash.
No.

44:16.054 --> 44:17.723
Not yet.

44:19.457 --> 44:21.727
Not until we know
what role he plays.
