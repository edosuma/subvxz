WEBVTT

00:08.162 --> 00:11.328
This is the best video game ever.

00:11.362 --> 00:14.462
- Jab, jab, jab... roundhouse!
- Backflip!

00:14.496 --> 00:18.266
[both] Jab! - Hey!
How many times have I told you guys

00:18.300 --> 00:22.669
- to keep video games video?
- I told them and I told them, Dad.

00:22.704 --> 00:24.604
Sword!

00:26.940 --> 00:31.610
Oh! That is not what they mean by "
slashing prices."

00:31.644 --> 00:34.680
Cool swords. Let me try.

00:35.582 --> 00:37.617
Wow, you look nice, Dad.

00:37.651 --> 00:39.151
I didn't even know you had a suit.

00:39.286 --> 00:41.987
I don't. Kick, kick, nose pull.

00:42.021 --> 00:44.089
Well, that suit does fit
you a little tight...

00:44.124 --> 00:46.425
Hey, that's my suit!

00:46.459 --> 00:48.927
That reminds me. Justin,
I need to borrow your suit.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.462
I'm taking your mother out to
dinner for our anniversary.

00:51.497 --> 00:54.031
Oh. Did you get her a card?
Because while Mom's reading it,

00:54.065 --> 00:55.732
you can slip the
waiter your coupon.

00:58.603 --> 01:02.172
My lamp! What is going on in here?

01:02.206 --> 01:05.174
Yeah. What is going on in here?

01:06.777 --> 01:09.478
I thought we had a
rule about wizardry.

01:09.512 --> 01:12.781
The random magic in this house
is getting on my nerves.

01:12.815 --> 01:16.150
How many times does this lamp have to
break for you guys to get the message?

01:16.184 --> 01:20.819
If the message is, "Ugly lamps are
easy to break," I think we got it.

01:21.955 --> 01:23.221
Your mother's right.

01:23.356 --> 01:25.123
We have to be more
considerate of someone

01:25.157 --> 01:28.292
who doesn't understand
the temptations of magic.

01:28.327 --> 01:31.428
Doesn't understand? Wait,
are you trying to make this my problem?

01:31.463 --> 01:33.497
[all] Oh!

01:33.531 --> 01:38.134
No. I was just saying that...
there... What was I saying?

01:38.168 --> 01:42.538
Uh, what Dad is saying is that we
should accept each other for who we are.

01:42.572 --> 01:44.573
Kind of like Dad did
when he married you.

01:44.908 --> 01:48.243
Yeah. I was a wizard at the time,
and it was a big decision for me.

01:48.277 --> 01:53.180
Oh. I'm sorry, Jerry. I had no idea it was
such a big decision for you to marry me.

01:53.215 --> 01:55.549
[all] Oh!

01:55.583 --> 01:59.052
No! It wasn't a big decision.
It was more of an impulse.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.621
No. Impulse is not helping.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.856
Let me know how your
anniversary dinner turns out.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.624
[all] Oh!

02:06.658 --> 02:09.660
<i>* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

02:09.693 --> 02:11.962
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

02:12.530 --> 02:15.265
<i>* You can fix any problem with the
slightest of ease Yes, please *</i>

02:15.299 --> 02:17.267
<i>* You might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

02:17.668 --> 02:19.035
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

02:19.804 --> 02:21.804
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

02:21.839 --> 02:23.372
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

02:23.406 --> 02:26.375
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

02:26.410 --> 02:30.279
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

02:30.314 --> 02:33.983
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

02:34.017 --> 02:38.554
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

02:38.588 --> 02:41.823
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

02:41.857 --> 02:45.860
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

02:45.895 --> 02:49.463
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

02:49.498 --> 02:53.600
<i>* Because everything is not *</i>

02:53.634 --> 02:54.635
<i>* What it seems *</i>

02:58.505 --> 03:01.073
Listen up, because of
your magic run amok,

03:01.107 --> 03:03.775
I have to go out and get some
"I'm sorry" gifts for your mother.

03:03.810 --> 03:07.078
[scoffs] Dad, come on!

03:07.112 --> 03:08.780
Mom's really easy.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.983
Why don't you just rub her feet?
That's what I do.

03:12.017 --> 03:15.186
Oh! That's just weird.

03:15.221 --> 03:19.055
Really? 'Cause I
don't have a bedtime.

03:20.290 --> 03:21.757
I'm not gonna rub her feet.

03:21.858 --> 03:24.693
That crooked toe
just freaks me out.

03:24.728 --> 03:27.762
Your mom will be fine once I buy
her some of her favorite things.

03:27.796 --> 03:30.163
Ooh! I know what you
should get her. - You do?

03:30.198 --> 03:32.999
Peach lip gloss and skull
and bones press-on-nails.

03:33.034 --> 03:35.735
That's what you want.
You're no help.

03:38.939 --> 03:42.073
Dad can relax. I went on the
World Wide WizWeb this morning

03:42.108 --> 03:44.745
and ordered Cupid to come
shoot Mom with a love arrow.

03:44.779 --> 03:48.416
You ordered Cupid?! Oh,
that makes perfect sense.

03:48.450 --> 03:51.218
Mom's mad that we're
using magic in the house.

03:51.252 --> 03:54.354
So, naturally, you bring
more magic into the house.

03:54.389 --> 03:56.623
Oh, brilliant.

03:56.658 --> 04:00.793
OK, OK. Everybody stop yelling.
I'll cancel the Cupid order.

04:00.828 --> 04:03.662
When people are right,
it doesn't mean they're yelling.

04:03.696 --> 04:06.164
You can't cancel Cupid
once he's been ordered.

04:06.365 --> 04:09.667
You'd know if you took it upon yourself
to read ahead, like a good student does.

04:09.701 --> 04:12.603
Oh, did you read about the
recipe for wizard punch? - No.

04:12.638 --> 04:15.740
- Good, I just made it.
- Ow!

04:15.774 --> 04:18.808
Oh, wizard punch.
I'll bet that's delicious.

04:22.712 --> 04:24.846
Well, you've got a problem.
When Cupid gets here,

04:24.880 --> 04:27.114
he isn't gonna leave until
he fulfills his order.

04:27.149 --> 04:30.050
[Cupid] Yep. Your brother's right.

04:30.084 --> 04:34.953
So who's the lucky guy or gal...
or thing? I don't judge.

04:34.987 --> 04:38.924
Oh, look. It's a baby with wings.
And a carrying handle.

04:38.958 --> 04:42.293
Back off. It's a sash, genius.

04:42.327 --> 04:47.263
Oh, this kid is gonna need me
when he grows up. I can just tell.

04:47.297 --> 04:50.967
Look, Mr. Cupid,
I ordered you by mistake.

04:51.001 --> 04:53.035
And, um, we really don't
need your services,

04:53.136 --> 04:55.404
- so if you could go back...
- Save it, sweetheart.

04:55.572 --> 05:00.108
I can't go anywhere until your
mom gets an arrow in the keister.

05:00.142 --> 05:04.011
OK, fine. Just shoot Mom in the
keister and get out of here.

05:04.046 --> 05:06.480
Hey, look, it's bendy!

05:08.383 --> 05:09.949
No, it's not.

05:11.285 --> 05:13.386
You broke my arrow!

05:13.420 --> 05:15.287
You have more arrows, right?

05:15.322 --> 05:18.924
I'm a baby! I'm barely
allowed to have this one!

05:21.761 --> 05:24.029
[Cupid] Hey, hey, hey!

05:24.063 --> 05:28.332
Don't leave me in here!
I'm afraid to be alone!

05:28.367 --> 05:31.969
OK, we've got to keep Cupid hidden
from Mom until we fix the arrow.

05:32.003 --> 05:34.204
- We? I don't think so.
- Hey!

05:34.239 --> 05:35.973
If she sees him, she'll blame me.

05:36.474 --> 05:39.208
Then I'll figure out a way to blame you.
We're all in this together.

05:41.010 --> 05:43.678
Come on, I'm always
saying dumb stuff.

05:43.712 --> 05:48.682
Our marriage is based on us ignoring each
other's flaws. I ignore all of yours.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.117
[all] Oh!

05:53.020 --> 05:54.587
What are you guys up to?

05:54.622 --> 05:57.457
Uh, not magic, that's for sure.

05:57.491 --> 06:01.761
Yeah, Mom, 'cause you know me. I always
tell you when these guys mess around with
magic.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.996
Always.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.900
- Is he gonna tell her?
- Sh!

06:08.935 --> 06:11.970
- Tell me what?
- [Cupid crying]

06:12.004 --> 06:15.539
Uh... about Max's
terrible stomach ache.

06:15.573 --> 06:19.442
His really, really bad
stomach ache. - [crying]

06:20.877 --> 06:22.878
In fact, there's a new
virus going around.

06:22.912 --> 06:25.880
<i>- The Influ cupidosa.
- Subtle.</i>

06:25.914 --> 06:30.049
<i>- I panicked!
- Oh, mijito!</i>

06:30.083 --> 06:34.185
Come on, let's go upstairs. I'll make you
some of Grandma's tree bark and fish oil
tea.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.820
[sobbing] You...

06:38.823 --> 06:41.158
What are we gonna do now?
We still have Cupid.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.192
You said, "we." You're
officially in. Awesome!

06:45.327 --> 06:46.628
Every time.

06:54.902 --> 06:56.969
OK. Mom's still upstairs.

07:01.574 --> 07:04.676
I made extra tree bark and
fish oil tea. Who wants some?

07:06.245 --> 07:07.878
Maybe later.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.614
Oh, goodness!

07:11.916 --> 07:14.048
Uh...

07:14.083 --> 07:17.084
What are you doing,
playing in the dirty dishes?

07:17.119 --> 07:19.020
Bad baby!

07:25.861 --> 07:29.397
Hi. Do you watching my little
brother for one second?

07:31.366 --> 07:35.269
Oh! Cute baby!

07:35.303 --> 07:39.272
[scoffs] Sure, the baby's cute.
But look at me, Mom. I'm way cuter.

07:42.242 --> 07:45.411
Hi, Alex. Look what I
knitted for Justin.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.214
Oh! That's interesting.

07:49.248 --> 07:51.316
And it smells like shampoo.

07:51.350 --> 07:54.751
It's a sweater entirely
made of my hair. - Oh!

07:54.786 --> 07:57.453
- Feel how soft it is.
- Uh...

07:57.488 --> 07:59.155
I take your word for it.

07:59.189 --> 08:02.158
He's upstairs with Max,
trying to fix Cupid's arrow.

08:02.192 --> 08:05.426
OK. Thanks. Notice how I didn't
react when you said Cupid?

08:05.461 --> 08:08.195
It's my way of acting cool with
having a wizard as a best friend,

08:08.230 --> 08:10.163
even though I'm
freaking out inside.

08:10.497 --> 08:13.832
Kind of like how I didn't freak
out when you said, "hair sweater."

08:17.169 --> 08:19.538
Thank you for watching him.

08:19.572 --> 08:21.473
There. Good as new.

08:21.507 --> 08:25.777
Now, Cupid can shoot Mom,
she'll love Dad and then go home.

08:25.811 --> 08:29.446
Know what? We are
really good at this!

08:29.480 --> 08:32.548
We should open up Cupid's
Arrow Repair Shop.

08:35.251 --> 08:38.919
There's only one Cupid.
He has only one arrow.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.219
Oh, yeah. Good point.

08:43.455 --> 08:46.890
We should also sell burgers.
Babies love burgers.

08:49.459 --> 08:53.028
Hi, guys. Justin,
what do you think of this?

08:53.062 --> 08:56.197
Um, it's kind of nice. Ooh!

08:56.232 --> 08:57.966
It's really soft, too.

08:58.367 --> 09:02.269
Great, because I knitted it for you
from my own hair. It's 100 percent me!

09:06.374 --> 09:08.340
Oh...

09:08.375 --> 09:12.143
I know. You don't
have to say anything.

09:12.177 --> 09:17.281
[laughs] Look, Harper,
I know you've had a crush, obsession,

09:17.315 --> 09:19.316
on me for a really long time,

09:19.550 --> 09:23.186
but I think it's about that time I
was completely honest with you...

09:23.221 --> 09:27.523
Harper, I am never,
ever, ever going to...

09:27.558 --> 09:31.192
[gasps] Ah!

09:31.226 --> 09:33.594
...love you more
than I do right now.

09:36.731 --> 09:38.699
Uh-oh.

09:40.435 --> 09:42.970
Oh, Justin. This is the
best day of my life!

09:43.005 --> 09:46.407
I should've made you a
hair sweater years ago.

09:46.441 --> 09:50.076
I would've been happier
and warmer if you had.

09:52.479 --> 09:54.747
Max! What did you do?

09:54.781 --> 09:58.783
Maybe Dad's right.
I shouldn't have a BB gun.

10:00.585 --> 10:03.853
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

10:03.887 --> 10:06.555
I love thee to the depth
and breadth... Oh!

10:06.589 --> 10:10.925
This'll be more romantic with
the sweater on. - Uh, Harper.

10:10.959 --> 10:13.528
Look, I hate to burst
your bubble here,

10:13.562 --> 10:17.665
but Justin's only acting like that because
Max just shot him with Cupid's love arrow.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.735
Gosh, I guess you're right.

10:20.769 --> 10:24.905
It's not real love if it comes
from his butt and not his heart.

10:24.939 --> 10:29.843
<i>Mi amor, let's go for a carriage
ride around Central Park.</i>

10:29.877 --> 10:32.011
But I don't care!

10:34.415 --> 10:38.384
- Where's your mother?
- Ah, Father. Thank you.

10:40.253 --> 10:41.921
For my lady love.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.191
Oh, yes!

10:46.225 --> 10:48.660
Why is he acting like
he's in love with Harper?

10:48.694 --> 10:52.162
What are you doing with an arrow?
And why are you holding a baby?

10:52.196 --> 10:57.133
Love... Arrow... Baby...
That's Cupid!

11:02.302 --> 11:05.039
To solve a problem that started
because you used magic?

11:05.873 --> 11:07.707
Yeah. That's kind of what I do.

11:10.443 --> 11:15.246
- What's that?
- Um... a baby.

11:16.915 --> 11:19.783
Hold still, or the baby gets it.

11:19.817 --> 11:23.620
Who's the baby? Oh! I'm the baby!

11:24.956 --> 11:27.890
OK, Alex. Why do you have a baby?

11:30.427 --> 11:34.295
Uh... It's a baby... doll...

11:34.330 --> 11:38.132
...from my Marriage
and Family class. Yes.

11:38.167 --> 11:42.037
- [Cupid burps]
- Excuse me.

11:44.239 --> 11:47.607
You know what, Alex? I think it's good
you're taking Marriage and Family.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.475
You're never too young to learn
how to get along with someone

11:50.510 --> 11:52.744
who makes it very difficult
to get along with.

11:52.845 --> 11:56.383
You are so right, Mom.
I'm gonna take this doll up to my room

11:56.417 --> 11:59.719
and think of ways for Dad
to appreciate you more.

11:59.754 --> 12:03.289
Wait a minute. Isn't your open
house at school this Friday?

12:03.324 --> 12:05.691
I want to meet your
Marriage and Family teacher.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.261
[both] Why?

12:09.295 --> 12:11.362
I have some personal
stories to share

12:11.397 --> 12:13.631
about what marriage and
family life are like

12:13.665 --> 12:16.768
once you get past the pretty
pictures in bridal magazines.

12:16.802 --> 12:22.072
I fixed it! - Oh! Maxy, I told you,
don't play with arrows.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.040
They're dangerous, honey.

12:24.075 --> 12:28.878
Someone could get stuck with
this and then where would we be?

12:28.912 --> 12:31.713
Closer to the end of our problem.

12:31.748 --> 12:35.417
Phew! That was close.

12:35.452 --> 12:40.021
Uh... you don't really have
Marriage and Family class, do you?

12:40.055 --> 12:42.690
I love how you know me.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:51.699 --> 12:55.135
I want to get a drink
of water, Justy.

12:55.169 --> 12:57.404
I only thirst for you, Harpy.

12:57.438 --> 12:59.438
Does that meanou
don't want any water?

12:59.473 --> 13:03.776
No. I want water, too.
We should share everything.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.651
Ah, the waters of love.

13:14.685 --> 13:18.020
Hey, Justin. Missed you
at Alien Language League.

13:18.055 --> 13:22.458
[speaks alien language] You
know what I'm sayin'? [laughs]

13:24.527 --> 13:27.795
I'm sorry, Zeke. I'm done
with your childish things.

13:27.829 --> 13:32.297
- I've found love.
- [laughs] With who?

13:34.467 --> 13:39.001
With me! Hello? Arm?
He's wearing my hair.

13:39.036 --> 13:40.969
Yeah, dude, what's
up with that sweater?

13:41.004 --> 13:44.607
You look like the floor
of a barber shop.

13:46.644 --> 13:49.445
Zeke, you've insulted
my woman's honor.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.481
We will settle this like gentlemen:

13:51.515 --> 13:53.782
Water balloon fight at 30 paces.

13:53.817 --> 13:55.617
I can't throw 30 paces.

13:55.652 --> 13:59.187
That's 'cause you throw like a...
[alien language]

13:59.221 --> 14:02.224
I do not throw like
a [alien language]

14:02.258 --> 14:06.329
Hey, everybody! There's gonna
be a fight outside! Over me!

14:07.765 --> 14:11.000
OK, my little Marriage
and Family folk.

14:11.034 --> 14:14.002
I hope you can rope your
noggins around today's lesson:

14:14.037 --> 14:17.106
Smart Shopping with Coupons.

14:17.140 --> 14:20.809
There's no better way to get more
bang for your buck than with...

14:20.843 --> 14:23.645
[Cupid crying] I'm bored!

14:23.679 --> 14:26.110
Shh!

14:26.144 --> 14:30.578
Who's that back in the south 40? Alex Russo,
you are not in this class.

14:30.613 --> 14:34.348
No, Mr. Laritate, I'm not.

14:34.383 --> 14:37.617
But it's always been my
dream to be in this class.

14:37.652 --> 14:42.455
And I think a dedicated teacher like you
would want to help me realize my dreams.

14:42.489 --> 14:46.859
[sniffs]

14:46.894 --> 14:51.263
I smell someone trying to
sell me some cow patty.

14:51.298 --> 14:54.532
Come on. I really
want be in this class.

14:54.566 --> 14:56.767
I even brought my own pretend baby.

14:56.868 --> 15:00.704
Which is huge, because anybody who
knows me knows I never come prepared.

15:00.738 --> 15:04.907
Look, Miss Russo,
I'm always partial to enthusiasm,

15:04.942 --> 15:08.578
but the train's already pulled
out of the station on this one.

15:08.612 --> 15:10.413
We did that assignment last month.

15:10.747 --> 15:14.449
But Mr. Laritate, how can you
say no to this little guy?

15:14.484 --> 15:16.350
[buzzing]

15:18.554 --> 15:21.957
What? Bad baby! No!

15:25.395 --> 15:27.630
I gave it a shot.

15:31.268 --> 15:33.802
A shaving baby doll?

15:33.837 --> 15:36.371
They've officially run out of toys.

15:44.946 --> 15:47.347
<i>Ma chÃ©rie.</i>

16:02.861 --> 16:06.598
[French accent] A quiet tÃªte a
tÃªte over a romantic dinner.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.700
Thanks, but it's only 3:
30 in the afternoon.

16:09.735 --> 16:14.003
[chuckles] It's never
too early for romance.

16:23.712 --> 16:26.546
Bubbly a la orange?

16:29.983 --> 16:33.085
Justin, the French thing
is nice but a little corny.

16:36.055 --> 16:39.790
You're right! I must go learn the
new language of love for you,

16:39.825 --> 16:43.692
which is... Cantonese.

16:43.727 --> 16:47.229
Come on, Albert. Let's go learn it.

16:49.565 --> 16:52.433
Thank goodness you're here.
I thought my dream had come true,

16:52.467 --> 16:55.568
but Justin won't let me out of his sight.
He's got his arm around me so much

16:55.602 --> 16:58.737
that my shoulder is starting to
smell like his armpit. Here, smell.

16:58.772 --> 17:02.341
Ah! No need. I'm not
gonna fight you on that.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.709
I don't think I can
live like this forever.

17:04.743 --> 17:06.711
[Cupid] Forever? No.

17:06.744 --> 17:09.246
Love from my arrow
is only temporary.

17:09.280 --> 17:13.015
Wait! This is temporary?
Why didn't you tell me that?

17:13.049 --> 17:15.516
I'm a baby. I forget things.

17:15.550 --> 17:19.983
Hey, look! I got a
belly button. [laughs]

17:20.018 --> 17:25.056
Dad, bad news. I couldn't get
into Marriage and Family class.

17:25.089 --> 17:26.858
It's OK. I think your mom forgot

17:26.892 --> 17:28.893
about talking to your
teacher at open house.

17:28.927 --> 17:31.362
Oh, that's right.
Tonight is your open house.

17:31.396 --> 17:34.298
Thanks for reminding me, Jerry.

17:34.332 --> 17:37.034
Yeah, thanks for
reminding her, Dad.

17:38.503 --> 17:40.504
I fixed it!

17:40.538 --> 17:44.307
Max, what did I tell you
about playing with arrows?

17:44.341 --> 17:46.876
Oh, sorry.

17:58.921 --> 18:00.455
Harper!

18:01.990 --> 18:03.991
What are you doing down there?

18:07.695 --> 18:09.462
Bring it in.

18:13.232 --> 18:14.732
You're never gonna believe this,

18:14.766 --> 18:17.067
but I signed up for scrapbooking.

18:17.101 --> 18:19.469
And I made one about us.
Check it out!

18:21.906 --> 18:25.644
Justin, you're taking all the fun out of
my unrequited, twisted obsession for you.

18:25.679 --> 18:29.216
Leave me alone! I'm the one who makes
the scrapbooks in this relationship!

18:29.250 --> 18:31.317
Harper!

18:33.320 --> 18:37.357
Hey, Justin. [speaks
alien language] Harper!

18:37.391 --> 18:40.360
[all laugh]

18:40.394 --> 18:43.496
What? I don't [alien
language] Harper!

18:45.665 --> 18:49.266
Ah! No, no,
no! Zeke! Guys! Wait up!

18:49.300 --> 18:52.136
[alien language]

18:52.170 --> 18:54.838
Thers my Justin.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.874
And you used to "da-ca" me.

18:57.908 --> 19:01.143
Dad, where's Mom? You were
supposed to keep an eye on her

19:01.178 --> 19:02.978
so she wouldn't go to my class.

19:03.113 --> 19:06.848
- I lost her by the cupcakes.
- Dad, cupcakes?

19:06.883 --> 19:09.951
All right. I got
lost in the cupcakes.

19:09.986 --> 19:12.354
- Where's Max?
- I...

19:14.390 --> 19:17.191
I sent him to wood shop so
he could fix Cupid's arrow.

19:17.226 --> 19:19.059
Let's go.

19:20.895 --> 19:23.663
...which is why I tell
your ducklings that...

19:23.697 --> 19:25.930
Oh, no. Mom beat us here.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.466
...from the rooster's
crow to the coyote's howl.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.701
- [laughter]
- You got that right, partner.

19:31.736 --> 19:35.104
Even raising the inconsiderate
rooster is a job.

19:35.138 --> 19:36.840
Mrs. Russo? Why are you here?

19:36.874 --> 19:38.642
I had thoughts on
marriage and family

19:38.676 --> 19:40.876
which you might find interesting.

19:40.911 --> 19:43.143
Yeah, but your daughter isn't in...

19:43.411 --> 19:46.411
Theresa, why don't we come back en Mr.
Laritate has more time to talk.

19:46.445 --> 19:49.480
Here's an article about
how difficult it can be

19:49.514 --> 19:53.983
when two very different people get married
and now they're afraid their mother was
right.

19:55.619 --> 19:57.653
I fixed it!

19:57.687 --> 20:00.021
What took you so long?

20:00.055 --> 20:01.589
Oh, would you just...

20:01.623 --> 20:04.291
OK, this is it.

20:04.325 --> 20:07.193
Cupid, it's time to save the
day with a perfect shot at Mom.

20:07.228 --> 20:09.863
Take the shot! Go!

20:13.701 --> 20:15.202
Oh, just shoot!

20:19.640 --> 20:21.407
Oh, no. What did you do?

20:21.441 --> 20:24.142
[Cupid] Hey, kid,
did you balance the arrow

20:24.176 --> 20:26.010
- after you fixed it?
- Yeah.

20:26.244 --> 20:29.546
It felt heavy on one side,
so I took the decorations off.

20:31.148 --> 20:34.617
You have the most beautiful eyes.
What color are they?

20:34.651 --> 20:38.487
Um... thank you.
eye brown, I think.

20:38.521 --> 20:41.323
Yeah, they're definitely brown.

20:42.925 --> 20:44.660
Great. Thanks a lot, Cupid.

20:44.694 --> 20:47.262
Now, I'm gonna have to start
calling that old lady Mom.

20:47.296 --> 20:50.530
I am not rubbing her feet.

20:50.565 --> 20:52.499
[Cupid] Relax. Look over there.

20:57.670 --> 21:02.540
Only to take you back to
the rest home, black eyes!

21:02.574 --> 21:07.011
My eyes aren't black. - Keep flirting
with my husband and you'll get there.

21:08.347 --> 21:10.582
[Cupid] You know,
sometimes jealousy

21:10.616 --> 21:12.918
works better than a love arrow.

21:13.086 --> 21:17.691
Well, Mom and Dad didn't get back together
the way I thought, but this will work.

21:17.726 --> 21:21.662
Come on, Mom. Let's go hear my PE teacher
tell you how I hate to run. It'll be fun.

21:24.698 --> 21:27.333
You're mine. Don't you forget that.

21:39.065 --> 21:43.400
So, you want to tell me, he's not going to
leave until I get shot in the butt with an
arrow?

21:43.435 --> 21:45.902
[all] Yeah, that's right.

21:45.936 --> 21:48.771
I really hate magic. Give me that.

21:52.342 --> 21:53.342
Ow!

21:54.844 --> 21:59.479
Oh! I love you guys.

22:01.948 --> 22:03.949
[Cupid] Works for me.

22:03.950 --> 22:13.950
