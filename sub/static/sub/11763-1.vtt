WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.573
OH! THERE IT IS! WHOO!
WHOO!

00:02.573 --> 00:05.676
(Ellie) THERE HE IS.
I THOUGHT YOU CRAZY KIDS
WERE GOING OUT.

00:05.676 --> 00:09.210
WE WERE, BUT YOU KNOW HOW
WE DRINK LOTS OF RED WINE?
YEAH, AND?

00:09.210 --> 00:12.213
THAT'S IT. PLUS, GRAYSON'S
GOT A NEW DRINKING GAME.
IT'S CALLED "MOVIE MASH-UP."

00:12.213 --> 00:15.216
YOU TAKE TWO MOVIE TITLES THAT
SHARE A WORD, COMBINE THEM,

00:15.216 --> 00:18.389
AND THEN YOU DESCRIBE
THAT MOVIE.

00:18.389 --> 00:20.551
FOR EXAMPLE--KILLER WHALE
GIVES OUT GOLDEN TICKETS

00:20.551 --> 00:22.653
TO SEE
WHO GETS HIS CANDY COMPANY.

00:22.653 --> 00:25.126
"FREE WILLY"... OOH... OOH...
"WILLY WONKA"...

00:25.126 --> 00:27.628
"FREE WILLY WONKA
& THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"!

00:27.628 --> 00:30.461
(cheering)
HA HA!

00:30.461 --> 00:34.135
I DON'T GET IT.
HOW IS IT A DRINKING GAME?
WELL,
WE DRINK WHILE WE DO IT.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.806
OH.
DUR.

00:35.806 --> 00:37.468
I GOT ONE!

00:37.468 --> 00:40.171
A FAT CARTOON CAT GETS TO PLAY
CATCH WITH HIS DEAD FATHER.
(stutters)

00:40.171 --> 00:43.274
OH! UH, UH...
"GARFIELD OF DREAMS"!
(cheering)

00:43.274 --> 00:46.617
BOOM SHAKALAKA!
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE YET.

00:46.617 --> 00:48.349
(sighs) ADIГіS, ALKIES.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.281
SEE YA, PALE GUY.
BYE, NERD.

00:50.281 --> 00:53.624
(Jules) BYE, HONEY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR BOY IS
GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE.

00:53.624 --> 00:56.157
ARE YOU FREAKING OUT
THAT TRAVIS IS LEAVING?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.458
I AM A LITTLE,

00:57.458 --> 01:00.191
BUT I'VE GOT
THIS GREAT NEW SHRINK.

01:00.191 --> 01:03.194
PLUS, I CAN ALWAYS LEAN
ON MY GRAYSON-SHIP.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.065
(scoffs) GRAYSON-SHIP?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.067
IT'S WHEN
YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP

01:07.067 --> 01:09.840
WITH AN EMOTIONLESS ROBOT.
(robotic voice)
I DON'T LIKE TO FEEL.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.843
NO, HE DOESN'T.
YOU KNOW HOW I DEAL
WHEN THINGS GET STRESSFUL?

01:12.843 --> 01:15.276
I EMBRACE MY SPANISH ROOTS.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.249
SIESTAS.
EVERY DAY. 2:00 P.M.

01:18.249 --> 01:20.381
NO MATTER WHAT.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.783
MR. TORRES,
MR. LAVERY'S HERE.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.615
NOT NOW, PAUL. VERY BUSY.

01:24.615 --> 01:26.217
(mouths word)

01:26.217 --> 01:27.718
(door closes)

01:27.718 --> 01:31.322
PAUL! WHERE'S COMFY BLANKIE?

01:31.322 --> 01:35.166
STARTING TOMORROW,
2:00 NAPS FOR EVERYBODY.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.397
(mouths word)

01:36.397 --> 01:39.230
A CRIME-SOLVING DOG DEALS
WITH RACISM IN BROOKLYN.
WHOA.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.871
OH.
NO, WAIT. I GOT IT.

01:40.871 --> 01:44.104
(mutters)
CRIME-SOLVING DOG?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.606
UH, OH! "MARMADUKE"...
"MARMADUKE"...

01:45.606 --> 01:48.279
AND, UH, RACISM... AND, UH...
"GONE WITH THE WIND"...

01:48.279 --> 01:50.841
MARMA...
UH, I HAVE NO CLUE.
"SCOOBY-DO THE RIGHT THING."

01:50.841 --> 01:52.843
(chuckles)
YOU SUCK.

01:52.843 --> 01:56.847
YOU KNOW, YOUR PARENTS ARE GONNA
MISS YOU SO MUCH, TRAVIS.

01:56.847 --> 01:59.790
YOU KNOW WHO'S GONNA
MISS ME THIRD MOST?

01:59.790 --> 02:02.653
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
LOOK IN THE MIRROR, FARRAH.

02:02.653 --> 02:04.595
PLEASE.

02:04.595 --> 02:07.158
I DON'T MISS PEOPLE.
I DISMISS THEM.

02:07.158 --> 02:09.660
WHEN MY FIRST DAD LEFT,
I WAS LIKE, "SEE YA."

02:09.660 --> 02:11.162
SECOND DAD--"PEACE!"

02:11.162 --> 02:13.664
THIRD DAD--"WHATEVER, DOUG.
DON'T LET THE DOOR

02:13.664 --> 02:16.607
HIT YOUR WHEELCHAIR
ON THE WAY OUT." BUH-BAM!

02:16.607 --> 02:19.610
WHEN I'M GONE, IT'S JUST GONNA
BE YOU AND THE OLD PEOPLE.

02:19.610 --> 02:20.911
I KEEP YOU YOUNG.

02:20.911 --> 02:24.175
в™Є BEEP-BEEP BOOP-BEP-BOOP в™Є

02:24.175 --> 02:26.817
YOU GO TO BED AT 9:30,
TRAVIS.
ONLY ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

02:26.817 --> 02:29.350
YESTERDAY I WAS TEARIN' IT
UP WITH MY BOYS,

02:29.350 --> 02:30.851
LIONEL RICHIE STYLE--

02:30.851 --> 02:33.184
ALL NIGHT LONG!

02:33.184 --> 02:35.186
I GOT 20 BUCKS THAT SAYS

02:35.186 --> 02:37.528
I CAN STAY UP
LONGER THAN YOU.

02:37.528 --> 02:39.330
DONE.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.462
WHAT WERE YOU AND YOUR
CRAZY BUDDIES DOING ANYWAY?

02:41.462 --> 02:43.594
EMILIO ESTEVEZ MOVIE MARATHON.

02:43.594 --> 02:46.537
THE ESTEVEZ FESTIVEZ.

02:46.537 --> 02:47.898
(laughs)

02:47.898 --> 02:50.871
I'M THINKING ABOUT
REINVENTING MYSELF IN COLLEGE.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.804
YOU HAVE TO.

02:53.804 --> 02:57.348
OH. I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR MY SHRINK'S APPOINTMENT.

02:57.348 --> 03:00.351
MY DAD CALLED ME DRUNK
AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

03:00.351 --> 03:03.354
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WASTE
YOUR MONEY ON THERAPY

03:03.354 --> 03:06.317
WHEN YOU HAVE ME. IF I HAVE
A PROBLEM, I JUST GO TO YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE REAL PROBLEMS.

03:06.317 --> 03:08.819
IT'S ALWAYS, "MY HUSBAND
LOVES ME TOO MUCH"

03:08.819 --> 03:11.262
OR "I HATE MY NANNY'S HAIR."

03:11.262 --> 03:12.863
PIGTAILS AT 50? REALLY?

03:12.863 --> 03:14.565
LOOK,
GLENN'S A PROFESSIONAL.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.867
ALREADY HATE HER.
YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU MET HER.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.869
I TOLD HER HOW TIGHT
I WAS WITH TRAVIS,

03:18.869 --> 03:20.871
AND NOW SHE BASES
OUR ENTIRE THERAPY

03:20.871 --> 03:22.373
ON THIS
INCREDIBLE RELATIONSHIP

03:22.373 --> 03:24.675
SHE HAS
WITH HER OWN SON GABRIEL.

03:24.675 --> 03:27.878
WE'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH MY PAST, MY DIVORCE...

03:27.878 --> 03:30.881
OH! AND SHE HELPED ME
GET RID OF MY FINGER GUNS.

03:30.881 --> 03:34.214
"JULES, THEY DON'T CONTROL YOU.
YOU CONTROL THEM."

03:34.214 --> 03:36.247
SEE,
THEY'RE JUST HANDS AGAIN.

03:36.247 --> 03:39.250
WELL, I ALREADY KNOW WHAT
SHE'S GONNA SAY ABOUT YOUR DAD.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.253
HE'S A GROWN-UP, AND IT'S NOT
YOUR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

03:42.253 --> 03:44.795
RIGHT.
BECAUSE IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

03:44.795 --> 03:46.797
JULES,
YOUR FATHER IS A GROWN-UP.

03:46.797 --> 03:48.759
YOU DO NOT HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

03:48.759 --> 03:50.831
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST
TAKE CARE OF YOU?

03:50.831 --> 03:53.534
RIGHT. IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.937
IT REALLY IS. FEEL LIKE
A LITTLE HONEYSUCKLE TODAY?

03:56.937 --> 03:59.410
BRING IT, GLENN.
(chuckles)

03:59.410 --> 04:01.472
SO WHERE WERE WE?
(clicks)

04:01.472 --> 04:03.474
ARE YOU STILL
IN A CODEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP

04:03.474 --> 04:05.516
WITH YOUR EX, FEELING LIKE
YOU DON'T DESERVE

04:05.516 --> 04:08.519
ALL THE GOOD THINGS
IN YOUR LIFE?
YES AND YES.

04:08.519 --> 04:12.353
SO I GUESS THAT I SHOULD MOVE
FORWARD WITH MY KITCHEN REMODEL?
I WOULD. (laughs)

04:12.353 --> 04:15.326
HEY(laughs) OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

04:15.326 --> 04:18.329
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE A LITTLE GUY TIME.

04:18.329 --> 04:21.492
LAST FEW WEEKS, I'VE BEEN
WITH JULES NONSTOP, SO IT'S--

04:21.492 --> 04:23.534
OH, I'M SORRY, MAN.
IS THAT--IS THAT WEIRD

04:23.534 --> 04:25.296
FOR ME
TO TALK ABOUT HER?

04:25.296 --> 04:27.698
NO, GRAY-HOUND.
I'M FINE WITH IT, BUDDY.

04:27.698 --> 04:29.400
BOBBY COBB IS A ROCK.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.403
I MEAN, SURE, HE USED
TO CARRY A TORCH FOR HER,

04:32.403 --> 04:34.875
BUT THAT TORCH HAS BEEN
SNUFFED OUT.
(blows air)

04:34.875 --> 04:37.848
HELL, I EAT LUNCH WITH HER
EVERY WORKDAY. HE DOESN'T CARE.

04:37.848 --> 04:39.980
(squeals)

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
(laughs)

04:41.982 --> 04:44.485
I KNOW, CHEDDAR.
I MEAN, I-I CAN--

04:44.485 --> 04:46.487
IT BINDS ME UP. (chuckles)

04:46.487 --> 04:48.989
(slurps)

04:48.989 --> 04:52.062
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY THINGS ARE
GOING REALLY WELL WITH GRAYSON.

04:52.062 --> 04:53.864
THAT'S GREAT.

04:53.864 --> 04:55.366
WHO'S GRAYSON?

04:55.366 --> 04:56.897
(laughs) MY BOYFRIEND.

04:56.897 --> 05:00.030
JULES,
DIDN'T HE TRY TO CHOKE YOU?

05:00.030 --> 05:02.503
NO, NO. THERE'S NO CHOKING.
THERE'S NO CHOKING?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.775
NO, NO, NO.
TH-THERE'S NO CHOKING.

05:04.775 --> 05:07.438
I MUST BE CONFUSING YOU
WITH ANOTHER PATIENT.
OH.

05:07.438 --> 05:09.440
GO ON. TELL ME ABOUT GORDON.
GRAYSON.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.881
FUN NAME. SHARE.

05:10.881 --> 05:12.883
WELL, I FEEL LIKE
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

05:12.883 --> 05:15.986
I-I'M NOT GETTING TOO FAR
AHEAD OF MYSELF, AND--

05:15.986 --> 05:19.420
MM.
OH, GOD. DID YOU
JUST BUST ME WITH A LOOK?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.722
I DO WHAT I DO. (chuckles)

05:21.722 --> 05:24.725
I AM GETTING SO FAR AHEAD
OF MYSELF THAT I'VE ACTUALLY

05:24.725 --> 05:26.727
NAMED THE ASIAN BABY
WE'RE GONNA ADOPT. (chuckles)

05:26.727 --> 05:28.959
(whispers) ARTHUR.
(laughs)

05:28.959 --> 05:32.863
(laughs, normal voice)
I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
OH, PLEASE.
THERE'S NO JUDGMENT HERE.

05:32.863 --> 05:35.866
DO YOU THINK THAT I FEEL
EMBARRASSED THAT I BELIEVE

05:35.866 --> 05:37.968
THAT THIS LITTLE CRYSTAL
STOPS ME FROM HAVING CANCER?

05:37.968 --> 05:40.340
WELL, IT DOESN'T.
OH, IT REALLY DOES.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.913
IT REALLY DOESN'T.
IT DOES, JULES.
NO JUDGMENT.

05:42.913 --> 05:46.647
OKAY.
THE REASON I CHOSE THERAPY--
OR I'M SORRY,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.949
I SHOULD SAY, THE REASON
THAT THERAPY CHOSE ME--

05:48.949 --> 05:51.652
IS BECAUSE I'M AN EMPATH.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.854
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.856
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING

05:55.856 --> 05:58.058
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THERE.
OH.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.091
DO YOU KNOW HOW TIGHT
YOU ARE WITH YOUR SON, UM...

06:01.091 --> 06:04.565
TRAVIS.
TRAVIS. WELL, THE FIRST TIME
I LET MY LITTLE GABRIEL GO

06:04.565 --> 06:06.867
AND HAVE A SLEEPOVER
AT HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE,

06:06.867 --> 06:09.139
I CRIED THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

06:09.139 --> 06:10.601
SOUL MATES.

06:12.443 --> 06:15.005
THIS'LL BE GOOD PRACTICE
FOR THE ALL-NIGHTERS

06:15.005 --> 06:17.147
I'LL BE PULLING IN COLLEGE.

06:17.147 --> 06:19.149
PLEASE TELL ME
BY "ALL-NIGHTERS"

06:19.149 --> 06:21.512
YOU MEAN PARTYING
AND NOT STUDYING.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.514
CAN'T IT BE BOTH?
(laughs) NO.

06:23.514 --> 06:25.516
HEY, HEY. IT'S 3:00
IN THE MORNING.

06:25.516 --> 06:28.489
I HAVE TO TAKE THE BAR
TOMORROW.
(lowered voice)
I'M SORRY, BABE.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.091
BIG WHOOP.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.764
I HAVE TO GO TO A BAR
TOMORROW.

06:33.764 --> 06:36.166
(both laughing)

06:41.401 --> 06:42.903
AAH!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.404
(sighs)

06:44.404 --> 06:46.807
OKAY. I'LL GIVE YOU
AN EASY ONE.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.109
DANIEL DAY-LEWIS PLAYS
A WHEELCHAIR-BOUND ARTIST

06:49.109 --> 06:51.442
WHO WANTS TO HAVE
A HIGH SCHOOL DANCE,

06:51.442 --> 06:53.944
EVEN THOUGH THE TOWN PREACHER
FORBIDS IT.

06:53.944 --> 06:56.917
(whispers)
WHEELCHAIR... DANCING...

06:56.917 --> 06:58.418
(normal voice) OHH!

06:58.418 --> 07:00.491
"MY LEFT FOOTLOOSE."

07:00.491 --> 07:03.994
THAT'S NOT EASY.
OW! STOP HITTING.

07:03.994 --> 07:05.996
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN,
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE,

07:05.996 --> 07:08.999
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CHOOSE ONE OF THE SIX MOVIES

07:08.999 --> 07:11.001
OUT OF MY DVD COLLECTION.

07:11.001 --> 07:13.003
AND, YES, TWO OF THEM ARE
HIP-HOP AB VIDEOS,

07:13.003 --> 07:15.836
BUT I DON'T CARE. WOULD YOU
JUST PLEASE MAKE IT WORK?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.138
GOT IT.
HEY, LISTEN, IF IT'S OKAY,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.811
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT TAKING TOMORROW OFF.

07:20.811 --> 07:22.513
FROM WHAT, WORK?

07:22.513 --> 07:25.015
NO, FROM--FROM YOU.
I MEAN, FROM US.

07:25.015 --> 07:27.848
THIS IS COMING OUT WRONG.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.850
NO, I-I THINK IT'S COMING
OUT PERFECTLY. (chuckles)

07:29.850 --> 07:32.923
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "I HATE YOU,"
WITHOUT ALL THE MEAN WORDS.

07:32.923 --> 07:34.855
(chuckles)
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.857
I-I THOUGHT
THAT OUR GRAYSON-SHIP WAS--

07:36.857 --> 07:38.128
WAS GOING GREAT.

07:38.128 --> 07:41.161
OUR GRAYSON-SHIP IS...
(laughs) GOT ME.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.993
OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS GOING FINE.

07:42.993 --> 07:45.065
I JUST WANT 24 HOURS
FOR MYSELF, OKAY?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.067
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.039
IT'S A HUGE DEAL, GRAYSON.

07:49.039 --> 07:51.241
I MEAN, ANYBODY WHO KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING

07:51.241 --> 07:53.674
WOULD THINK
THIS IS A HUGE DEAL.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.906
NO, THEY WOULDN'T.
REALLY?

07:55.906 --> 07:59.680
SURE. TAKE A DAY OFF.
NO BIG DEAL.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.913
THANKS, DOC. HOTTEST DOCTOR
I'VE EVER SEEN, BY THE WAY.

08:02.913 --> 08:04.254
THANK YOU. INAPPROPRIATE.

08:04.254 --> 08:06.156
SEE YOU IN THE CAR.

08:06.156 --> 08:08.018
WAIT. THAT'S IT? HE WINS?

08:10.961 --> 08:12.963
IT'S NOT FAIR.
(car door closes)

08:12.963 --> 08:15.125
I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR.
NOTHING'S REALLY FAIR.
(honks horn)

08:15.125 --> 08:17.668
(chuckles)
IGNORE HIM. JUST IGNORE HIM.

08:17.668 --> 08:20.671
в™Єв™Єв™Є

08:30.581 --> 08:33.584
SO IT IS 10:17.
I WILL SEE YOU IN 24 HOURS.

08:33.584 --> 08:36.216
OH. (sighs)
WHO CARES WHAT GLENN SAYS?

08:36.216 --> 08:39.550
THE HELL WITH HER.
LET'S GO CAMPING.
YOU DON'T CAMP.

08:39.550 --> 08:41.922
SHH! WHAT DO YA SAY?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.594
SEE YA TOMORROW.

08:44.895 --> 08:46.627
(groans) HE JUST LEFT,

08:46.627 --> 08:50.200
AND I'M ALREADY JONESING
FOR HIS CUDDLES.
GRAYSON'S A BIG CUDDLER?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.903
I DON'T REMEMBER.
IT'S ALL SLIPPING AWAY.

08:52.903 --> 08:56.066
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE GLENN MADE A MISTAKE.

08:56.066 --> 08:59.039
YOU SHOULD TAKE ELLIE
AND GO AND FIND HER

08:59.039 --> 09:01.812
AND GIVE HER A CHANCE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

09:01.812 --> 09:04.144
WAIT IN THE CAR.
I'M GETTING MY KEYS. (grunts)

09:04.144 --> 09:06.016
SUCKA!

09:06.016 --> 09:07.918
DIE.

09:11.021 --> 09:13.053
JULES!
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?

09:13.053 --> 09:16.056
(laughs)

09:16.056 --> 09:18.088
MUSTACHE ON A LADY.
ALWAYS FUNNY.

09:18.088 --> 09:21.692
CHECK THIS OUT.
DAVID CARUSO.

09:21.692 --> 09:23.994
(deep, gruff voice)
WE'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS.

09:26.236 --> 09:28.198
WHERE WERE YOU LOOKING?

09:28.198 --> 09:31.041
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT GLENN'S AT YOGA?

09:31.041 --> 09:33.874
WELL, WHENEVER SHE LEAVES
OUR SESSION TO PEE,

09:33.874 --> 09:35.876
I GO THROUGH
HER DATEBOOK.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.278
WELL, HELLO, LADIES.
HI, BARB.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.281
I JUST SPENT THE LAST HOUR
GETTING MY BODY TWISTED

09:41.281 --> 09:44.715
INTO ALL SORTS OF POSITIONS
BY A SWEATY INDIAN MAN.

09:44.715 --> 09:47.688
I'M GLAD
YOU ENJOYED YOGA CLASS.
WHAT YOGA CLASS?

09:47.688 --> 09:50.290
AND THERE IT IS.
ADIEU.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.824
I HONESTLY NEVER SEE IT
COMING.
WELL, YOU'RE JUST A DUMMY.

09:53.824 --> 09:55.826
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN GLENN COMES OUT,

09:55.826 --> 09:59.099
I'M GONNA ACT SURPRISED
TO RUN INTO HER, OKAY?
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.272
YOU KNOW, WE PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE TO BE THIS SNEAKY.

10:02.272 --> 10:05.105
I MEAN, YES, IT'S HER DAY OFF,
AND, YES, I'M A PATIENT,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.037
BUT SHE REALLY LIKES ME.

10:07.037 --> 10:10.140
I WONDER IF SHE FEELS GUILTY
TAKING MY MONEY.
MAYBE SHE SHOULD PAY YOU.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.282
(crash)

10:12.282 --> 10:14.985
MOTHER BUDDHA.

10:14.985 --> 10:18.689
HOW ARE YOU NOT TIRED?

10:18.689 --> 10:19.990
I SHOULD BE!

10:19.990 --> 10:22.993
I RAN THE DUNES FOR
MY MORNING WORKOUT, WENT HOME,

10:22.993 --> 10:25.926
PUT SMITH UP ON THE BLOCKS
AND CHANGED HIS OIL.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.198
STILL, I HAVE NEVER FELT
MORE AWAKE.

10:28.198 --> 10:31.962
CHANGED HIS... OIL?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU CAN'T PSYCH ME OUT.

10:31.962 --> 10:35.866
SEEING YOU FALL APART--
IT'S SAD AND BEAUTIFUL.

10:35.866 --> 10:38.208
(mouths words)

10:38.208 --> 10:41.071
AH, IT'S NICE TO GET IN A LITTLE
BREAK FROM JULES, YOU KNOW?

10:41.071 --> 10:43.043
(chuckles) WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO WITH OUR GUY TIME?

10:43.043 --> 10:45.045
MAYBE, UH, HAVE SOME BEERS,
PLAY SOME...

10:45.045 --> 10:47.047
(high-pitched voice)
PENNY CAN? (chuckles)

10:47.047 --> 10:50.320
EH... WE'RE GONNA STAKE OUT
A BUS BENCH.
OKAY. I CLEANED UP JULES.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.383
I NEED NEW FRIENDS.
PIPE DOWN!

10:53.383 --> 10:55.385
(groans) AAH!
I'M GONNA BE UNDERCOVER
ON THE BENCH...

10:55.385 --> 10:58.028
(British accent) JUST A NORMAL
BLOKE READING THE RACING FORM.

10:58.028 --> 11:00.030
'ELLO, GUV'NOR.
(normal voice) BOBBY.
MM.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.893
YOU'LL BE CHILLIN' ON THE LAWN
OVER THERE WITH YOUR... PONY.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.935
COOL.
GRAYSON, I NEED YOU
UP IN THAT TREE.

11:04.935 --> 11:07.838
WHAT?
SOMEONE HAS TO BE
THE LOOKOUT.

11:07.838 --> 11:10.971
MNH-MNH. I'M TAKING LAWN.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.974
HUG BATTLE. SKIN ON SKIN.
FIRST ONE TO BAIL LOSES.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.976
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
SHIRTS OFF.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.408
I GOT THE TREE.

11:18.408 --> 11:21.952
DAMN IT, DAMN IT, DAMN IT,
DAMN IT, DAMN IT! YOU--

11:21.952 --> 11:23.413
CALM.

11:23.413 --> 11:24.915
CENTER.

11:24.915 --> 11:26.416
FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

11:26.416 --> 11:29.119
MY ANGER IS A PUDDLE.
I SIMPLY STEP OUT.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.261
HELLO, JULES.

11:31.261 --> 11:33.293
HI.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

11:33.293 --> 11:36.196
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY GRAYSON NEEDS TO TAKE

11:36.196 --> 11:39.199
A DAY OFF FROM ME. I MEAN,
I--WHAT IS HE EVEN DOING?

11:41.431 --> 11:43.904
AL GORE DOES
A PowerPoint PRESENTATION

11:43.904 --> 11:45.976
ON MADONNA'S NAKED BODY.

11:45.976 --> 11:48.238
"AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH OR DARE"!

11:48.238 --> 11:51.812
(laughs)
STOP TALKING. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.014
YOU'RE REALLY BALD
FROM UP HERE.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.847
(laughs)
SO UNCOOL.

11:56.847 --> 12:00.320
JULES, GRENDON JUST WANTS
SOME ALONE TIME.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.924
YOU KNOW, THIS ACTUALLY
REMINDS ME OF A GABRIEL STORY.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.027
I LOVE GABRIEL STORIES. IT'S
LIKE SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.460
(voice breaking) THIS WEEKEND
IS HIS FIRST COMMUNION.

12:10.460 --> 12:13.033
OHH.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.936
(inhales deeply) I MEAN, THEY
JUST--THEY GROW UP SO FAST,

12:15.936 --> 12:19.970
AND HE IS SUCH
A FREE SPIRIT, YOU KNOW,

12:19.970 --> 12:22.742
THAT I FEEL LIKE,

12:22.742 --> 12:25.045
IF I DON'T HAVE HIM
RIGHT NEXT TO ME

12:25.045 --> 12:26.746
ALL THE TIME,

12:26.746 --> 12:28.748
HE'S JUST GONNA RUN AWAY.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.221
(voice breaks) THIS IS
JUST LIKE ME AND GRAYSON.

12:31.221 --> 12:32.923
(nasal voice) IS IT?

12:32.923 --> 12:35.285
YOU'VE GOTTA
LET HIM OFF THE CHAIN

12:35.285 --> 12:37.157
ONCE IN A WHILE.

12:40.290 --> 12:41.992
HEY, GLENN.

12:41.992 --> 12:44.294
UH, WERE YOU GONNA LEAVE
A NOTE?

12:44.294 --> 12:46.466
OF COURSE I WAS.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.799
MM-HMM.
MM.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.271
WHY THE JUDGMENT,
THE SUSPICION?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.204
ARE YOU ELLIE?
IS THAT ELLIE?

12:54.204 --> 12:56.376
HI, ELLIE.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.149
I GOTTA GO GRAB A SHOWER.

12:59.149 --> 13:01.381
HEY, DON'T GO UPSTAIRS
AND FALL ASLEEP.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.353
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

13:03.353 --> 13:06.016
(Ellie)
I KNOW IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH

13:06.016 --> 13:08.959
TO KEEP YOUR TINY LIZARD BRAIN
FUNCTIONING--

13:08.959 --> 13:11.121
POCKET OF AIR,
A FEW HUFFS OF SPRAY PAINT--

13:11.121 --> 13:13.223
BUT HOW ARE YOU
STAYING AWAKE?

13:13.223 --> 13:16.566
I'M CHEATING. WHENEVER
I'M NOT WITH TRAVIS, I SLEEP.

13:16.566 --> 13:19.429
LOOK, I KNOW I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GIVE HIM 20 BUCKS,

13:19.429 --> 13:22.302
BUT IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT TO
WATCH HIM LOSE HIS MIND, RIGHT?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.234
IMAGINARY HAT.

13:24.234 --> 13:28.008
IMAGINARY OPERA GLOVES. WHAT
IS THIS? WHAT ARE WE DOING?

13:28.008 --> 13:31.942
SO DUMB.
YOU KNOW
WHY I HATE WHAT GLENN SAID?

13:31.942 --> 13:34.044
OH! HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
IT'S 2:00 P.M.

13:34.044 --> 13:36.917
SIESTA TIME. I CALL COUCH!
I CALL COUCH!

13:38.518 --> 13:40.550
REALLY?

13:44.124 --> 13:47.958
IS THIS WHAT YOU PEOPLE DO
ALL DAY? YOU JUST SLEEP?

13:47.958 --> 13:50.000
COME ON!

13:50.000 --> 13:51.501
I WAS RIGHT HERE!

13:53.263 --> 13:56.937
WOW! I FEEL GREAT.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.309
GOOD LORD,
YOU WAKE UP PEPPY.

13:59.309 --> 14:02.312
NOW WHERE WAS I
BEFORE SIESTA?

14:02.312 --> 14:05.515
OH, RIGHT. YOU KNOW
WHY I HATE WHAT GLENN SAID?

14:05.515 --> 14:08.478
BECAUSE SHE IS SO AMAZING
THAT I HAVE TO LISTEN.

14:08.478 --> 14:10.480
SHE WASN'T GONNA LEAVE
A NOTE.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.453
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU WANT

14:13.453 --> 14:16.086
AS YOUR "LIFE COACH"?
ARE YA THAT JEALOUS?

14:16.086 --> 14:18.258
SHE JUST SEEMS A LITTLE OFF.
WELL, YOU'RE OFF.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.131
SHE'S CRAZY.
YOU'RE CRAZY.

14:21.131 --> 14:23.163
I'M NOT A THERAPIST.
THANK GOD!

14:23.163 --> 14:25.996
SHE WASN'T GONNA LEAVE
A NOTE.
SHE WAS!

14:25.996 --> 14:27.537
PROVE IT!

14:27.537 --> 14:30.000
GLENN.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.043
HI. UH,
THIS IS NOT ABOUT GRAYSON.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.545
THIS IS ABOUT THE NOTE
THAT YOU LEFT.

14:35.545 --> 14:37.908
THAT SOUNDS
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

14:37.908 --> 14:39.910
COME ON, GABRIEL.
UP, UP, UP.

14:39.910 --> 14:42.212
DON'T BE RUDE.
SAY HI TO JULES.

14:42.212 --> 14:43.984
WHAT?
WHAT?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.515
GABRIEL IS A DOG?

14:45.515 --> 14:47.517
MY LITTLE BABY.

14:47.517 --> 14:50.490
HELLO, MY LITTLE BABY.
I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.493
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. OH, YES.
UP, UP, UP. MM, MM, MM, MM, MM.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.226
(high-pitched voice) YAY.
(whispers indistinctly)

15:02.432 --> 15:05.105
YOU BASED ALL
OF MY TREATMENT ON YOUR DOG?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.207
MM-HMM.
OKAY, I AM GONNA--

15:07.207 --> 15:10.010
I'M JUST GONNA LIGHT
A LITTLE SAGE IN HERE,

15:10.010 --> 15:13.013
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S VERY CALMING.
(clicks lighter)

15:13.013 --> 15:15.015
SO LET'S JUST...
(whistles) IT'S CALM.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.949
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LIED TO ME.
HEY, HEY, HEY, JULES!

15:18.949 --> 15:22.222
AND, YES,
THIS IS MY STERN VOICE!
I DON'T LIKE
YOUR STERN VOICE.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.295
ALL I EVER DID WAS USE MY...
(coughs) PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

15:25.295 --> 15:27.097
TO HELP YOU.

15:27.097 --> 15:30.400
ALL RIGHT? I HAVE NEVER LIED
IN THIS OFFICE. EVER.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.964
THIS IS A SACRED... (coughs)
CIRCLE OF TRUTH.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.406
(coughs)
IS IT, GLENN?

15:36.406 --> 15:40.210
WHAT?
TELL ME, AFTER WE LEFT, DID YA
LEAVE A NOTE ON THAT CAR?

15:40.210 --> 15:42.572
YES, I DID.
WHAT'D IT SAY?

15:42.572 --> 15:44.574
IT SAID, "SUCK IT."

15:44.574 --> 15:47.017
HMM.
I'M NOT PERFECT, JULES.

15:47.017 --> 15:50.120
REALLY?
THAT'S WHY WE CONNECT.
WE'RE KINDRED SPIRITS.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.422
LAST TIME YOU SAID
THAT YOU FELT GUILTY

15:52.422 --> 15:54.584
BECAUSE YOU HUNG UP
ON YOUR DAD.

15:54.584 --> 15:57.187
LAST CHRISTMAS
I SET MY CAR ON FIRE

15:57.187 --> 15:59.689
SO THAT MY DAD WOULD THINK
I WAS DEAD.

15:59.689 --> 16:01.261
THOSE AREN'T THE SAME!

16:01.261 --> 16:04.164
EH, THEY'RE SO CLOSE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:04.164 --> 16:07.637
I'M DONE PLAYING
WITH YOUR JUDGMENT GAMES.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.669
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY.
(rustles paper)

16:09.669 --> 16:13.343
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER THERAPIST.
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

16:13.343 --> 16:15.645
HERE'S YOUR INFORMATION.

16:15.645 --> 16:17.677
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YEP.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.250
YOU ARE A NUT JOB!
EH.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.312
YOU TAKE YOUR DOG
TO COMMUNION.

16:22.312 --> 16:25.315
HEY! THAT WAS NOT MY CHOICE!
THAT WAS GABRIEL'S CHOICE!

16:25.315 --> 16:28.618
I WAS TOTALLY AGAINST THAT,
JULES!
(exhales deeply)

16:28.618 --> 16:30.120
FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

16:30.120 --> 16:32.622
MY ANGER IS
IN A PURPLE BALLOON,

16:32.622 --> 16:34.994
AND I LET IT GO.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.496
(imitates gunshot)

16:36.496 --> 16:39.029
IT'S BACK.

16:39.029 --> 16:41.571
NOT REAL.

16:43.133 --> 16:46.706
SO ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE

16:46.706 --> 16:50.280
THAT'S BEEN WRITING ON JULES?
WHAT? OH, NUTS. THE MARKER.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.142
YEAH,
AND ALSO YOUR HANDS.

16:52.142 --> 16:54.784
LOOK,
I MAY NOT BE TOTALLY COOL

16:54.784 --> 16:57.787
WITH THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND JULES THING JUST YET.

16:57.787 --> 16:59.789
I CAN'T TALK
TO ANYBODY ABOUT IT.

16:59.789 --> 17:03.053
I LOVE SEEING JULES HAPPY,
BUT I CAN'T TALK TO HER,

17:03.053 --> 17:05.195
'CAUSE SHE'LL END UP
FEELING GUILTY.

17:05.195 --> 17:07.257
I CAN'T TELL ANDY,
'CAUSE HE'LL TELL ELLIE.

17:07.257 --> 17:09.359
EVEN DOG TRAVIS CAN'T
BE THERE FOR ME.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.361
I MEAN, HE UNDERSTANDS
HAPPY AND SAD,

17:11.361 --> 17:13.503
BUT HE DOESN'T GET
THE SPECIFICS. BUT YOU--

17:13.503 --> 17:15.505
YOU WERE THE OUTSIDE GUY.

17:15.505 --> 17:17.807
I COULD TALK TO YOU
ABOUT ANYTHING. COME ON.

17:17.807 --> 17:21.111
LET'S GO. COME ON.

17:21.111 --> 17:22.812
THAT'S IT, TRAV.

17:22.812 --> 17:26.816
(whispers) YOUR LITTLE EYES
ARE CLOSING NOW.

17:26.816 --> 17:28.678
(door opens and closes)

17:28.678 --> 17:30.550
WINE! NOW!

17:30.550 --> 17:33.052
(normal voice)
GAH! I ALMOST HAD HIM!

17:33.052 --> 17:35.685
NO, NO. I NEED BIG JOE.

17:35.685 --> 17:38.328
в™Є AH в™Є

17:38.328 --> 17:41.661
OKAY, WHILE YOU FILL THAT UP,
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO GRAYSON.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.094
DON'T GO OVER THERE.

17:44.094 --> 17:45.395
LET GO.

17:45.395 --> 17:48.398
MAN HANDS, HELP ME.
WHAT? WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

17:48.398 --> 17:50.400
WOULD YOU LET GO OF ME?
WHA--

17:50.400 --> 17:54.274
COME ON. I CAN DO WHAT I WANT!
OH, LOOK. HE'S ASLEEP.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.775
AW.
SO CUTE.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.578
THAT'S MY BOY. (chuckles)
NO!

17:58.578 --> 18:00.180
(door slams)
JULES.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.811
ELLIE, GO BACK INSIDE.

18:01.811 --> 18:03.813
NO.
(stomps foot)

18:03.813 --> 18:06.156
THE REASON THAT
I DIDN'T LIKE GLENN--

18:06.156 --> 18:07.457
SHE TOOK MY SPOT.

18:07.457 --> 18:09.459
I LIKE HEARING
YOUR PROBLEMS

18:09.459 --> 18:11.661
AND KEEPING YOU
FROM DOING DUMB STUFF.

18:11.661 --> 18:14.164
IT'S THE CLOSEST THING
I HAVE TO A JOB.

18:14.164 --> 18:16.466
OKAY.

18:16.466 --> 18:19.499
DON'T GO OVER TO GRAYSON'S
HOUSE. IT'LL SEEM DESPERATE.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.871
I'M GOING THERE.
BUT IF YOU IGNORE HIM

18:21.871 --> 18:23.873
AND PRETEND
LIKE NOTHING'S WRONG,

18:23.873 --> 18:26.406
HE WILL COME CRAWLING BACK.
TRUST ME.

18:28.238 --> 18:31.511
HI, DUMMY!

18:31.511 --> 18:34.144
HELLO.

18:34.144 --> 18:36.816
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT,
BECAUSE I JUST SAT ON A SNAIL.
SHH, SHH.

18:38.348 --> 18:41.651
(lowered voice)
THERE YOU GO.

18:41.651 --> 18:43.693
AND BY THE WAY...

18:43.693 --> 18:45.655
(whispers)
I TOTALLY CHEATED.

18:45.655 --> 18:49.159
(lowered voice) IT'S JUST
FUN TO SCREW WITH YOU.

18:49.159 --> 18:51.161
(Cary Brothers' "Belong"
playing)

18:51.161 --> 18:53.863
YOU'RE A GOOD KID, TRAV.

18:53.863 --> 18:56.566
AND I KNOW WHAT I SAID,
BUT...

18:58.208 --> 19:00.410
I AM GONNA MISS YOU.

19:00.410 --> 19:01.911
в™Є WAKE UP LONELY в™Є

19:01.911 --> 19:03.843

19:03.843 --> 19:05.815
в™Є ONE MORE NIGHT в™Є

19:05.815 --> 19:07.447
(chuckles)

19:08.848 --> 19:12.322
(sighs) OOH.

19:12.322 --> 19:14.384
TRAV! WE GOT A GUEST.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.586
в™Є YOU DREAM OF OUR FORTUNES в™Є

19:16.586 --> 19:19.559
WHOA. THAT'S AMAZING.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.562
YEAH, HE LIKES TO OPEN 'EM
UP WITH HIS TEETH,

19:22.562 --> 19:24.564
BUT I HAD TO PUT
THE KIBOSH ON THAT,

19:24.564 --> 19:27.437
BECAUSE HE KEPT SWALLOWING
TOO MANY BOTTLE CAPS.

19:27.437 --> 19:29.439
WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR?

19:29.439 --> 19:32.802
CAME BY TO HAVE A BEER.

19:32.802 --> 19:34.804
(sighs)

19:34.804 --> 19:36.606
HEY, MAN,

19:36.606 --> 19:38.908
I AM YOUR FRIEND,

19:38.908 --> 19:41.911
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK
TO ME.

19:41.911 --> 19:44.214
(groans)

19:44.214 --> 19:46.216
JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

19:46.216 --> 19:48.718
DON'T COMPLAIN
ABOUT GETTING TO SPEND TIME

19:48.718 --> 19:51.491
WITH JULES, OKAY?

19:51.491 --> 19:52.822
NOT TO ME.

19:57.827 --> 19:59.669
(clink)

19:59.669 --> 20:01.671
в™Є WHAT I'D GIVE в™Є

20:01.671 --> 20:05.204
BIG JOE'S NOT HELPING.
I WANNA GO SEE HIM.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.577
NO.
YOU CAN'T GO OVER THERE.

20:07.577 --> 20:09.739
HEY.

20:09.739 --> 20:11.981
(whispers) HE'S HERE.
BE COOL.

20:11.981 --> 20:14.684
в™Є WHEN YOU WERE MINE в™Є

20:14.684 --> 20:17.587

(whispers)
I ORDER YOU TO BE COOL!

20:17.587 --> 20:19.589
(normal voice) SO WHAT'S UP?

20:19.589 --> 20:21.721
HASN'T BEEN 24 HOURS YET.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.524
I MISSED YOU.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.895
REALLY?

20:25.895 --> 20:27.897
YEAH.

20:27.897 --> 20:29.429
в™Є ALIVE в™Є

20:29.429 --> 20:31.931
A BUNCH OF KIDS SEARCH
FOR TREASURE

20:31.931 --> 20:33.733
ON A DESERTED ISLAND

20:33.733 --> 20:36.666
AND THEN HAVE SEX
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.968
OHH. OKAY. UM...

20:38.968 --> 20:41.541
DESERTED ISLAND
AND THEY WERE HAVING SEX?

20:41.541 --> 20:44.414
THEY'VE HAD SEX.
THINK. SEX. OKAY. THINK.

20:44.414 --> 20:48.378
OHH! I DON'T KNOW.

20:48.378 --> 20:52.722

20:52.722 --> 20:54.724
OH! "THE BLUE LAGOONIES"!
(chuckles)

20:54.724 --> 20:56.726
I GOT ONE!

20:56.726 --> 20:58.027
OHH.

20:58.027 --> 21:00.029
в™Є WHEN YOU WERE MINE в™Є

21:00.029 --> 21:05.995
в™Є 'CAUSE YOU WERE MINE в™Є

21:22.352 --> 21:23.853
CLAMMY! UGH!

21:23.853 --> 21:26.416
HA HA HA!
HUG BATTLE CHAMPION!

21:26.416 --> 21:27.917
(grunts)

21:27.917 --> 21:31.020
WHAT WAS THAT EVEN ABOUT?

21:31.020 --> 21:33.663
TO SEE
WHO GETS THE LAST FRY.

21:33.663 --> 21:36.366
PUT YOUR SHIRTS BACK ON.
