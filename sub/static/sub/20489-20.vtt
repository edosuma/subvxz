00:32.031 --> 00:35.200
Didn't my friends explain that
we only want to talk to you?

00:35.235 --> 00:38.438
Guess i didn't
wait around long enough
to give them the chance.

00:38.473 --> 00:41.241
Just want
to find out a few things
about you, that's all.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.669
This is how i like things,
a little more even.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.872
Two against one with
your back up against the wall?

01:13.273 --> 01:15.275
Bet you'd love to find out.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.501
You stay away
from me with that thing.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.703
Look whose back's
up against the wall now.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.725
You're the most
perfect creatures i've
ever seen in my life.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.127
If i can't have you...

02:08.527 --> 02:10.895
you do have me.

02:10.930 --> 02:16.136
But more importantly,
i have you.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.515
What took you so long?

02:30.550 --> 02:33.353
I took a wrong
turn and ended up on the
other side of the building.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.160
Come on i phase and mass,
i don't have x-ray vision.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.773
They went out this way.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.787
No signs of trauma.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.590
Or the new mutant.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.393
Or life.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.426
Never even found out her name.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.829
Now she's just more grist
for eckhart's genetic mill.

04:22.864 --> 04:23.630
Wow.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.597
If it wasn't for your
decryption program,

04:25.632 --> 04:27.233
we wouldn't
have even known the
capture was going down.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.235
Still, wish we'd gotten
to her before they did.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.802
Display.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.640
This is the gsa communication
for the past twelve hours.

04:33.675 --> 04:35.607
Decrypt.

04:35.642 --> 04:39.646
It doesn't look like any
new mutant's been brought in.

04:39.681 --> 04:42.413
What's anomite?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.851
What are you reading?

04:45.251 --> 04:50.056
Something about
the gsa arranging to acquire
stolen supply of annomite.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.464
Uh oh.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.867
That's your serious look.

05:00.902 --> 05:01.668
Yeah.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.635
Try very serious.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.672
Imagine eckhart with the
ability to render the most

05:06.072 --> 05:08.875
sophisticated cyber-security
system completely ineffective.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.877
Even ours?

05:10.912 --> 05:11.678
Yeah.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.279
Well, anomite's a virus.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.082
And it can be introduced
into any connected computer.

05:16.117 --> 05:18.484
If he gets his hands on
it he'd have the ability to

05:18.519 --> 05:20.887
compromise any safeguard
i could come up with.

05:22.889 --> 05:25.256
We'd be out of business.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.094
And anybody else
who stands in his way.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.899
Ooh. Ah. Uh huh.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.702
Make you feel better.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.104
Kicking your
butt usually does.

05:38.139 --> 05:40.123
Letting that
new mutant get away,

05:40.158 --> 05:42.108
that kind of puts
a damper on things.

05:42.143 --> 05:43.274
You know what?

05:43.309 --> 05:44.475
This is how i figure.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.714
As long as we rescue
more than we lose...

05:50.917 --> 05:51.718
do you want to break?

05:52.118 --> 05:53.319
Do you want to lose?

05:53.354 --> 05:54.520
I don't think so.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.732
Okay, would you stop.
You're distracting me.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.937
Tough break.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.542
Must have still been moving.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.144
I don't think so.

06:18.179 --> 06:19.746
No.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.148
I didn't lay a finger on it.

06:22.183 --> 06:23.750
C'mon.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.523
You know what?

06:32.558 --> 06:34.160
Just take the first shot.

06:34.195 --> 06:36.162
I'll be right back.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.938
Brennan.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.574
What's up, tony?

06:48.975 --> 06:50.541
Long time, man.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.780
Last time i saw
you, you we're turning
me into proxy blue.

06:53.815 --> 06:54.981
Yeah.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.983
Look, i'm... i'm
sorry about that, man.

06:57.018 --> 06:58.602
If i'd known
where to find you,

06:58.637 --> 07:00.186
i would have
apologized months ago.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.987
Is that so?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.354
Honestly.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.792
I... i'm a changed man.

07:05.827 --> 07:07.358
Oh, what?

07:07.393 --> 07:08.995
Religious conversion?

07:09.030 --> 07:10.561
Better.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.798
I'm in love.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.765
Well, that's funny.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.366
For as long
as i've known you,

07:15.401 --> 07:17.003
you couldn't
even get a woman
to look at you.

07:17.038 --> 07:18.569
Now all of a sudden
you're in love?

07:18.604 --> 07:21.007
Believe me, brennan, she's
a total knockout, man.

07:21.042 --> 07:22.608
Absolutely phenomenal.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.210
I can't believe my ears.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.612
Tony reese giving up
the life for a woman.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.179
Wait a second.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.216
I... i never said i was
giving up the life, man.

07:30.251 --> 07:32.218
I'm working for her.

07:32.253 --> 07:34.185
Ah.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.787
Whatever floats
tour boat, man.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.224
Since we hooked, we
been raking it in, man.

07:38.259 --> 07:40.226
Check the fringes.

07:40.261 --> 07:42.193
Wow. Flashy.

07:42.228 --> 07:46.232
In fact,
she just brought in a guy
who claims he can deliver

07:46.267 --> 07:48.634
a five million dollar payday.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.002
If you want,

07:51.037 --> 07:53.840
i could talk
to her about bringing
you in for a deal or two?

07:53.875 --> 07:56.242
No. Thanks for
the offer, though.

07:56.277 --> 07:57.809
I'm retired.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.846
You don't know
what you're missing.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.619
Any word on
our missing agent?

08:08.654 --> 08:11.457
The one gs agent who might
have told us what happened

08:11.492 --> 08:14.225
to ames died
during the mission.

08:14.260 --> 08:18.229
Initial analysis
indicates cardiac arrest.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.266
Sounds like a review
of agency fitness standards

08:20.301 --> 08:21.885
is in order, mr halloran.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.434
I'll get
that going, sir.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.471
And the other four
gs agents on the mission...

08:25.506 --> 08:27.073
what, they witnessed nothing?

08:27.473 --> 08:29.876
They were distracted.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.278
By mutant x, sir.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.645
Well, once we
acquire the anomite,

08:34.679 --> 08:39.085
these mutant x distractions
can finally be put to rest.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.486
I've got good news on
that front, mr eckhart.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.655
Deal's set
for this afternoon.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.894
We've made contact
with this disgruntled
government scientist.

08:47.929 --> 08:50.696
Dr. Tork is anxious
to do business.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.698
I'll just bet he is.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.910
Oh my god.

09:03.945 --> 09:05.476
Adam?

09:05.511 --> 09:07.078
What do you got?

09:07.113 --> 09:10.116
I just decrypted the final
e- mail from the gsa to dr. Tork.

09:10.151 --> 09:13.119
They're meeting at the peterson
building five minutes from now.

09:13.519 --> 09:14.685
Shalimar? Brennan?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.722
Deal goes
down in five minutes.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.724
We'll be there.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.157
Dr. Tork?

09:51.192 --> 09:54.325
Halloran?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.163
It's the anomite, i presume?

09:57.198 --> 09:59.966
The money?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.372
Let's see what
we're dealing with.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.386
Doesn't look like much.

10:20.421 --> 10:22.388
Looks can be deceiving.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.790
With the anomite in this
case could easily infiltrate

10:24.825 --> 10:27.158
hundreds of computer systems.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.595
I've given ten years
of my life to this project.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.398
Congratulations,
it's about to pay off.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.207
Now.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.810
Mulwray?

10:45.211 --> 10:47.213
You know him?

10:47.248 --> 10:48.814
Oh yeah.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.241
Go.

11:26.452 --> 11:28.054
Shai...

11:30.456 --> 11:32.058
tony!

11:58.884 --> 12:00.086
Shalmar.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.087
Oh...
i gotta get that one.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.306
No,
i'll take care of them.

12:03.341 --> 12:04.490
You're going
back to sanctuary.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.656
No.

12:05.691 --> 12:06.892
We can't just let
them get away with that.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.511
Shh.

12:08.546 --> 12:10.096
No.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.705
Does he need
an ambulance?

12:20.106 --> 12:21.672
Yeah.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.110
Tell them not
to run any red lights.

12:34.653 --> 12:37.056
Ow, ow, ow.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.859
Ah,
i thought you said this
wasn't going to hurt.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.826
And you believed me?

12:41.861 --> 12:43.828
It's called
bedside manner.

12:43.863 --> 12:47.066
Now be a good
girl and you'll get a
lollipop when were done.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.232
Ow.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.634
You throw in a balloon
and i'm all yours.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.873
So when did eckhart's boys
start playing shoot to kill?

12:53.908 --> 12:55.474
That's the weird thing.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.478
I mean,
yesterday i went chasing
down this guy who's hunting

12:59.513 --> 13:01.480
a new mutant for the gsa.

13:01.881 --> 13:07.887
And today he's ripping them
off and taking shots at me.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.854
Ow.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.891
Oh, you're a beast.

13:11.926 --> 13:13.092
You're a baby.

13:13.127 --> 13:14.293
Ha.

13:14.693 --> 13:15.895
It's just one of
those situations, man.

13:15.930 --> 13:17.061
You know...

13:17.096 --> 13:18.697
the minute we got into
the peterson building...

13:19.098 --> 13:20.299
i just felt funny.

13:20.699 --> 13:21.901
I was just totally
thrown off my game, you know?

13:22.301 --> 13:23.903
I... shalimar, takes a bullet
out of nowhere and then...

13:24.303 --> 13:25.870
and then tony shows up?

13:25.905 --> 13:31.075
So tony and this gs agent took
off with the anomite, huh?

13:31.110 --> 13:33.512
It must have been the
five million dollar payday
that he was crowing about.

13:33.547 --> 13:34.678
Brennan!

13:34.713 --> 13:36.715
Nice job getting shalimar
back here for treatment.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.682
That couldn't have been easy.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.319
Could have been picking her
arm up off the ground and she

13:40.719 --> 13:41.921
still would have been
out there tracking him down.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.888
What's the word
on the late dr. Tork?

13:43.923 --> 13:47.091
I thought dr. Tork was director
of the anomite project.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.528
Apparently he wasn't
getting the recognition
he felt he deserved.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.931
So he went and traded
to the highest bidder.

13:51.966 --> 13:53.497
Right.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.534
What concerns me the most is
that all his research is lost,

13:55.569 --> 13:57.101
now that he's dead.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.702
So it can't be recreated?

13:58.737 --> 14:02.341
Not without
the stolen prototype,
which makes that priceless.

14:02.376 --> 14:03.943
No. No, no,
it's definitely got a price.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.509
It's a steep one.

14:05.544 --> 14:06.710
Hey!
Where are you going?

14:06.745 --> 14:08.747
I'm gonna go get
some answers from tony,

14:08.782 --> 14:10.749
before anyone else gets hurt.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.718
Not only was the transaction
completely botched.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.156
But the only person who can
recreate the formula is lying

14:17.191 --> 14:18.775
on a slab in the morgue.

14:18.810 --> 14:20.359
It was mutant x again, sir.

14:20.759 --> 14:22.361
Mutant x don't carry guns.

14:22.396 --> 14:26.783
Who killed dr. Tork?

14:26.818 --> 14:31.170
Gs agent carl ames, sir.

14:40.779 --> 14:44.783
Well, then, bring me
ames and the anomite.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.602
That's a tall order, sir.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.352
And if you can't fill it,

14:48.387 --> 14:51.991
you'll find yourself
on a slab next to dr. Tork.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.212
Do you
remember that trick?

15:13.612 --> 15:15.214
You're not going to throw
one of those at me, are you?

15:15.614 --> 15:16.815
Not unless you make me.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.218
You know,
i always knew there was
something weird going on

15:19.253 --> 15:20.784
with you back then.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.222
Well,
since you know one
of my little secrets,

15:23.622 --> 15:24.823
why don't you
tell me one of yours?

15:24.858 --> 15:27.191
Look, man, i gotta go.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.827
Who's the woman
you're working for?

15:28.862 --> 15:30.394
I can't...

15:30.429 --> 15:32.431
that case that you
jacked can put a lot of

15:32.466 --> 15:33.632
innocent lives in jeopardy.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.434
I don't know
anything about that.

15:35.469 --> 15:36.800
Well, i'm telling
you about that.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.437
Somebody i care about's
been shot over it already.

15:38.837 --> 15:41.240
Look, brennan, we're just
the middle men, all right?

15:41.275 --> 15:43.242
All i care
about is the pay-off.

15:43.277 --> 15:44.408
So what?

15:44.443 --> 15:46.045
To hell with
anyone who gets hurt?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.211
Is that it?

15:47.246 --> 15:48.412
I can't
think about that.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.414
Yeah,
well i'm telling you
to think about it.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.851
If that case falls into the
wrong hands, i'm going to hold

15:52.886 --> 15:55.254
you and whoever you're working
for personally responsible.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.869
Yeah,
run home to your little
girlfriend there, tone.

16:10.904 --> 16:13.672
God knows how she's
getting along without you.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.870
What are you doing here?

16:46.905 --> 16:48.907
You didn't think i'd
give up that easy did you?

16:49.308 --> 16:51.310
I told you,
i want the case.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.117
Well, you're just too
good to be true aren't you?

16:58.152 --> 17:02.121
And you, you didn't
tell me we had company.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.527
Lorna templeton.

17:08.926 --> 17:12.496
Brennan mulwray.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.733
That's never
happened before.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.102
He's bad news, lorna.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.339
I want the case
that your boys took.

17:24.943 --> 17:27.310
Is that all you want?

17:27.346 --> 17:29.348
You've seen
what he can do.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.715
Not everything.

17:31.750 --> 17:36.955
Just give me the
case and i'll walk away.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.323
No questions asked.

17:39.358 --> 17:42.961
But then i might
never see you again.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.563
Where is it?

17:49.368 --> 17:51.770
In here.

18:09.388 --> 18:11.390
You know, the first time i
laid eyes on you i knew we had

18:11.425 --> 18:13.392
something
extraordinary in common.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.812
The case.

18:15.847 --> 18:18.197
Of course.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.607
Open it, please.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.215
You know, you and i
would make an incredible team.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.418
I'm already on a team.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.785
Guess what?

18:41.820 --> 18:44.223
You're about
to be traded.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.095
Good morning.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.415
You're up early.

19:26.450 --> 19:28.700
I couldn't sleep.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.867
Yeah.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.503
I didn't get
much sleep either.

19:31.538 --> 19:35.507
I figured.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.710
I never claimed to be
a one-man woman, did i?

19:39.111 --> 19:41.478
No.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.716
But you've never invited
me in there before.

19:44.751 --> 19:49.086
Where'd you get that ring?

19:49.121 --> 19:51.924
I've never seen
you wearing that.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.343
Brennan gave it to me.

19:54.378 --> 19:56.693
How could you do this?

19:56.728 --> 19:59.531
Brennan's more like me
than you'll ever know.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.498
That's it, lorna.

20:01.533 --> 20:05.102
I didn't want
it to come to this.

20:05.137 --> 20:09.942
I'll be damned
if i'll let anyone
else have you.

20:09.977 --> 20:13.510
Tony. Stop.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.748
Tony,
you don't want to do this.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.317
Come on. Stop it.

20:20.352 --> 20:26.358
Think about
what it would be like to
live in a world without me.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.585
What happened to tony?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.187
Nothing.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.188
Nothing. He's fine.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.790
He looks like he's...

20:58.825 --> 20:59.992
no.

21:10.402 --> 21:13.605
He looks just fine.

21:16.808 --> 21:17.609
Any luck?

21:17.644 --> 21:18.775
No.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.777
His comlink's
still de-activated.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.379
Brennan took a
gps transmitter with him.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.816
He figured
if tony wouldn't talk, he'd
plant a bug and follow him.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.219
Well, we can
try to get a frequency lock
off the gps satellite, huh?

21:27.254 --> 21:28.820
Call me when
you got something.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.422
Okay.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.426
Still no word
from brennan, huh?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.592
No.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.629
Have you tried to
connect telepathically?

21:37.664 --> 21:38.830
You think i should?

21:40.432 --> 21:42.434
That's just
not like him to be out
of touch like this.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.214
What?

21:57.249 --> 22:00.052
Come on what is it?

22:00.452 --> 22:02.419
Look at you,
you're blushing.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.856
Well, i think there's a
perfectly good reason why

22:04.891 --> 22:07.259
we haven't heard from him.

22:22.474 --> 22:25.677
You are
absolutely spoiling me.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.853
And you're ruining me.

22:36.888 --> 22:40.892
I can't imagine
being with anyone
else after you.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.295
It's because
i'll never let you.

22:43.330 --> 22:45.297
That's fine with me.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.272
I don't know, i gotta
tell you though...

22:55.307 --> 22:58.310
i don't know, there's
something inside of me that's

22:58.345 --> 23:01.278
screaming out how wrong
this is on so many levels.

23:01.313 --> 23:05.717
But i would slit my throat
before i would ever leave you.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.485
How sweet.

23:08.520 --> 23:14.526
You know, all my
life i always wondered
what it would be

23:14.561 --> 23:20.532
like if
there was someone else
in the world like me.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.952
Well, there's one
lying right next to you.

23:22.987 --> 23:25.337
I haven't ever know
what that was like.

23:25.372 --> 23:28.940
To not have
to be alone.

23:28.975 --> 23:32.144
Never again.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.150
Five million in cash.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.669
I don't know, ames.

23:40.704 --> 23:42.154
Well, then forget it.

23:42.554 --> 23:43.755
We'll take the
anomite elsewhere.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.921
No, no.

23:44.956 --> 23:46.558
I think i can get
approval from eckhart.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.759
I'm sure you can.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.127
And don't worry about mutant x.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.164
Brennan mulwray
has joined our crew.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.131
Mulwray is with you?

23:54.166 --> 23:57.334
Lorna can be very persuasive.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.972
Like she persuaded
you to desert the gsa?

24:01.007 --> 24:04.541
Lorna or eckhart
- which would you choose?

24:04.576 --> 24:07.779
I'll make the arrangements
through the usual channels.

24:10.582 --> 24:13.184
Five million
dollars, mr halloran?

24:13.219 --> 24:15.752
With ames in on
the deal, sir, it's...

24:15.787 --> 24:18.590
with that
kind of ransom, you'd
better deliver them both.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.393
No more complications.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.200
Adam, i tried the data
from the gps transmitter to an

24:28.235 --> 24:31.368
apartment owned
by a lorna templeton.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.206
Now, we've got the
one-night stand kind of guy,

24:34.606 --> 24:37.008
but i did a little
digging, anyway...

24:37.409 --> 24:39.210
yeah,
she's a new mutant.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.977
We've got
the file down here.

24:41.012 --> 24:44.181
Before she was born, she
underwent genetic splicing with

24:44.216 --> 24:49.821
arachnid dna,
specifically from the species
androctonus australis.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.189
A scorpion.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.626
It was an experimental
procedure designed to boost her

24:54.661 --> 24:56.593
compromised immune system.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.831
I'm sure they had no idea
back then that she'd mutate

24:59.866 --> 25:01.833
into something so dangerous.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.400
So, brennan's with her?

25:03.435 --> 25:05.437
Yeah, well according
to the transmitter location

25:05.472 --> 25:08.257
and what emma picked up.

25:08.292 --> 25:11.042
What did you pick up, emma?

25:11.443 --> 25:14.846
I didn't really
get a clear hit from
her so i couldn't make

25:14.881 --> 25:18.967
out that many features but
he was definitely with a woman.

25:19.002 --> 25:23.054
Brennan would not fall into
bed with someone like that.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.056
Well he may
not have any choice.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.023
Off.

25:27.058 --> 25:30.862
She's exhibiting
scorpion characteristics.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.666
A female scorpion,
when it attracts a mate,

25:34.701 --> 25:36.668
it emits a powerful
chemical, right?

25:37.068 --> 25:40.237
A pheromone.

25:40.272 --> 25:44.075
She might literally
be the one woman on earth
who no man can resist.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.879
Yeah, well,
from i was picking up he
wasn't doing much resisting.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.282
So what are we waiting for?

25:50.317 --> 25:51.082
Let's go get him.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.249
No, no, no.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.450
We can't
just go get him.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.051
I mean, if he's under
her pheromonal control,

25:55.086 --> 25:57.088
he's going to fight us
to the death to protect her.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.891
Well,
then maybe we should just
wait 'til it wears off.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.294
Well, there's a risk in that
because once scorpions mate,

26:02.329 --> 26:04.914
if the male
is around long enough,

26:04.949 --> 26:07.499
the female eventually kills him.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.269
I just decrypted the
last communique from the gsa.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.706
They're going
to make another attempt
at acquiring the anomite.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.308
You and emma go intercept.

26:16.343 --> 26:17.909
Great.

26:20.712 --> 26:24.316
Everything seems
to be in order.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.486
Yes. Looks good to me.

26:29.521 --> 26:34.326
Nothing like cold, hard cash.

26:34.361 --> 26:37.128
Well, almost nothing.

26:39.931 --> 26:44.736
One more thing - eckhart
wants ames as part of the deal.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.303
Forget it.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.140
No ames, no deal.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.107
That simple.

26:51.142 --> 26:52.709
Listen, halloran.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.746
You take your five million
dollars back to eckhart and tell

26:54.781 --> 26:57.949
him where he can shove it.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.516
You know something?

26:59.551 --> 27:01.953
I don't have a problem
with that request.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.573
You, brennan?

27:04.608 --> 27:07.158
Not at all.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.125
Lorna?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.727
Sorry, carl.

27:10.762 --> 27:13.164
I have all the
man and money i need.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.737
Brennan.

27:20.772 --> 27:22.173
Guys,
get the hell out of here.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.692
This has nothing to do with you.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.052
It has everything to do with us.

27:25.087 --> 27:26.378
She's messing
with you, man.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.780
Can't you see
she's using her new mutant
powers to control you?

27:29.180 --> 27:31.182
Okay. Let's go, baby.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.208
Brennan!

28:05.216 --> 28:06.418
Lorna?

28:06.818 --> 28:08.820
Take care of him.

28:16.828 --> 28:17.994
Emma?

28:18.029 --> 28:19.030
Emma, you okay?

28:19.065 --> 28:20.031
Yeah. Yeah.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.633
Take it easy.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.234
I can't
believe he did that.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.401
Yeah, weli...

28:24.436 --> 28:26.838
the minute i'm sure he's
okay, i'm going to kill him.

28:27.238 --> 28:28.805
Get in line.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.242
Looks like he was under
a pheromone spell as well.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.244
We better
take him with us.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.846
Yeah.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.187
What was brennan
trying to pull?

28:44.222 --> 28:46.624
It's bad enough that he's
sleeping with the enemy,

28:46.659 --> 28:49.392
but... he actually
tried to kill me.

28:49.427 --> 28:51.029
Yeah, but, see, if brennan
really wanted to kill you,

28:51.429 --> 28:52.996
i think you'd be dead.

28:53.031 --> 28:57.435
See, this hold that lorna
has on him is powerful,

28:57.836 --> 29:00.638
well, we're bringing
the gsa agent that
flipped over to her side.

29:00.673 --> 29:02.240
He's cooperating?

29:02.275 --> 29:04.207
So far.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.443
Alright, good.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.045
He might be the key
in getting brennan back.

29:07.445 --> 29:09.447
I'm heading
over to the safehouse.

29:10.648 --> 29:11.815
How could this have happened?

29:11.850 --> 29:13.451
The money was
practically in my hands.

29:13.486 --> 29:14.652
Come on.

29:15.053 --> 29:15.819
Don't worry about it.

29:15.854 --> 29:17.420
I can arrange another
deal with eckhart.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.057
With you involved,
he'll suspect another set-up.

29:19.457 --> 29:20.223
No he won't.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.260
Not if it's one
on one on his own turf.

29:22.295 --> 29:23.827
That's too dangerous.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.864
There's no telling
what he might do to you.

29:25.899 --> 29:27.683
Come on, baby.

29:27.718 --> 29:29.432
Think about it.

29:29.467 --> 29:32.670
If eckhart doesn't have
his hands on the anomite,

29:32.705 --> 29:33.872
then he's not going
to lay a finger on me.

29:33.907 --> 29:37.040
That's a good point.

29:37.075 --> 29:41.479
And then we could
run miles and miles
away where no one

29:41.514 --> 29:43.481
could ever find us.

29:59.898 --> 30:03.101
I think our little
cupcake here is
starting to wake up.

30:09.507 --> 30:11.509
It looks like
brennan really knocked
you for a loop there.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.111
Kill that son of a...

30:13.511 --> 30:19.082
where the hell am i?

30:19.117 --> 30:21.119
Well,
seeing as how lorna
threw you to the wolves,

30:21.154 --> 30:23.922
you can consider
this someplace safe.

30:23.957 --> 30:26.289
Lorna loves
me and i love her.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.691
It's just a
misunderstanding, that's all.

30:28.726 --> 30:31.329
I think the only
one misunderstanding
here is you.

30:31.364 --> 30:33.932
Hopefully,
this'll help bring
you to your senses.

30:33.967 --> 30:35.498
What is that?

30:35.533 --> 30:38.336
It's an antl-virus
created from a contaminant

30:38.371 --> 30:40.703
i found in your blood.

30:40.738 --> 30:44.742
This should counteract lorna's
pheromonal control over you.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.344
You're wasting your time.

30:46.744 --> 30:47.911
Yeah?

30:47.946 --> 30:49.913
Well,
then this lorna templeton.

30:49.948 --> 30:52.350
Why don't you tell
us how you feel about her?

30:52.385 --> 30:54.717
Lorna?

30:54.752 --> 30:57.155
She's the most incredible...

31:05.964 --> 31:08.366
oh my god,
what was i thinking?

31:08.401 --> 31:10.768
Oh.

31:11.169 --> 31:16.774
I can't believe i put my life
on the line for that tramp.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.778
And to what
do i owe the honour?

31:21.179 --> 31:23.947
Well, if you call off
your goons then we can talk.

31:23.982 --> 31:28.186
Do not mistake my admiration
for your fortitude as stupidity.

31:28.221 --> 31:32.390
Call 'em off or you can kiss
your precious anomite goodbye.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.201
What?
And you're not a goon?

31:47.605 --> 31:49.607
I'll be close.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.615
Well then,
mr mulwray, it seems you
have my undivided attention.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.182
Yeah.

31:59.217 --> 32:00.818
Well, be both know
that i got what you want.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.621
So the only
thing for us to discuss
is the most painless way

32:03.656 --> 32:05.989
for us to complete
this transaction.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.026
I take it you're not
looking for suggestions.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.627
No.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.430
I'm just looking for a way for
both of us to walk away happy.

32:12.465 --> 32:14.797
Emphasis on "walk away".

32:14.832 --> 32:19.237
How do i know this is not
simply another mutant x ploy?

32:19.272 --> 32:21.239
Oh, mutant x
is out of the picture.

32:21.274 --> 32:22.840
It's just you and me.

32:23.241 --> 32:28.046
And to what can i attribute this
rather sudden change of heart?

32:28.081 --> 32:32.050
Revenge? Greed?

32:32.450 --> 32:36.419
Love.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.657
Of course.

32:40.058 --> 32:44.062
The most powerful
motivator of all.

32:44.097 --> 32:48.066
Anyway, we gonna
do this deal, or what?

32:48.101 --> 32:50.468
Do i have a choice?

33:13.691 --> 33:16.059
Brennan.

33:16.094 --> 33:18.061
Can i talk to you?

33:18.096 --> 33:19.697
Yeah. Look. I don't
want to hear it, shal.

33:19.732 --> 33:20.463
Okay?

33:20.498 --> 33:21.699
Just tell adam...

33:22.100 --> 33:23.701
would you
just... stop it.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.703
I know what you're
going through.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.471
I've been
there myself.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.707
Well, then, you know
that it's not that

33:30.108 --> 33:31.709
i don't care about
you guys, it's just...

33:32.110 --> 33:33.711
i know.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.079
How's emma?

33:36.114 --> 33:38.481
Well, she's going
to be all right.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.918
It's a good thing
you kept your voltage
dial down, though.

33:40.953 --> 33:44.487
Well,
tell her i'm sorry.

33:44.522 --> 33:49.292
Shal, i can't be a
part of mutant x any more.

33:49.327 --> 33:55.333
Well, i'm sure you'll
understand if i don't jump
up and down about that.

33:55.368 --> 33:59.737
Yeah.
I'm going to miss you.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.347
I'm going
to miss you, too.

34:09.746 --> 34:12.514
Good luck.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.952
Good luck to you too.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.159
What did eckhart say?

34:23.195 --> 34:24.962
He's willing to deal.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.529
Oh-oh-oh!

34:26.563 --> 34:30.533
That is great.

34:30.568 --> 34:34.536
So what
do you think?

34:34.572 --> 34:37.775
Are we asking enough
money for this thing?

34:37.810 --> 34:39.342
I don't know.

34:39.377 --> 34:41.379
You know, eckhart's
already sketchy enough
about dealing with me.

34:41.414 --> 34:43.380
The last
thing i want to do is
ask for more money.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.581
Yes.

34:44.982 --> 34:45.748
Yes.

34:45.783 --> 34:47.350
Keep our options open.

34:47.385 --> 34:49.387
Maybe we could sell this
thing to the highest bidder.

34:49.422 --> 34:50.987
You know, are you
ever going to stop?

34:51.023 --> 34:52.989
How much
money is enough?

34:56.994 --> 34:59.362
You're right.

34:59.397 --> 35:02.600
I don't know
what came over me.

35:02.635 --> 35:05.403
I guess i'm just excited.

35:15.012 --> 35:16.979
You know, i'm sorry.

35:17.014 --> 35:19.417
I'm not...
not in the mood.

35:19.452 --> 35:21.419
We can fix that.

35:29.827 --> 35:32.630
Kiss me, brennan.

35:32.665 --> 35:35.433
I'm not in the mood.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.404
As a matter of fact,

35:41.439 --> 35:44.642
i'm not comfortable with
this whole operation, here.

35:44.677 --> 35:46.244
What are
you talking about?

35:46.644 --> 35:48.246
Do you have
any idea the amount of
destruction that eckhart

35:48.281 --> 35:50.648
would cause if he
got his hands on that case?

35:51.048 --> 35:53.015
You know that's
not our concern.

35:53.050 --> 35:56.654
It's time somebody
did the right thing.

35:56.689 --> 36:00.223
Brennan, i'm sorry.

36:00.258 --> 36:04.662
But i'm not walking
away from this.

36:05.062 --> 36:08.666
And neither are you.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.953
Why did it have
to come to this?

36:30.988 --> 36:33.791
We could have
been so happy together.

36:55.813 --> 36:58.216
You think you're just going
to fly your little love nest?

36:58.251 --> 36:59.782
What did you do to him?

36:59.817 --> 37:05.423
I guess i was just
too much woman for him.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.626
This is going
to be worth the pain.

37:12.630 --> 37:13.831
All right.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.633
His heart
rate's dropping.

37:15.668 --> 37:17.034
We gotta get
him out of here.

37:17.069 --> 37:19.036
Mulwray's an hour late.

37:19.437 --> 37:22.640
We should have insisted you
go along with him for insurance.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.843
I took the initiative of having
a gs agent tail him, sir.

37:25.878 --> 37:28.211
We know exactly where he went.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.048
Well, then it should be a simple
matter for you to find him

37:31.083 --> 37:35.052
and to bring him here
- with the anomite.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.058
Keeping him alive are
his new mutant antibodies.

37:41.093 --> 37:43.426
He's burning up, adam.

37:43.461 --> 37:45.062
Adam, he's at
a hundred and seven.

37:45.097 --> 37:46.664
I thought you
gave him the antl-venom.

37:46.699 --> 37:47.465
I did.

37:47.865 --> 37:49.031
It hasn't
kicked in, yet.

37:49.066 --> 37:51.068
We gotta
find a way to bring his
body temperature down

37:51.103 --> 37:52.687
or he's going
to suffer brain damage.

37:52.722 --> 37:54.272
What if we covered
his body in ice?

37:54.307 --> 37:55.473
Yeah. Good idea.

37:55.508 --> 37:56.639
Anything.

37:56.674 --> 37:58.676
Well this will be quicker.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.082
He's down two degrees.

38:05.483 --> 38:06.684
Good, emma.

38:07.084 --> 38:08.286
Keep it up.

38:11.088 --> 38:13.090
He's at
a hundred and two.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.057
Emma, great.

38:15.092 --> 38:17.460
He's out
of the woods.

38:17.495 --> 38:20.698
Good thing we got
to him when we did.

38:31.509 --> 38:34.312
We did a thorough search
of your apartment.

38:34.347 --> 38:36.714
There was no
sign of the anomite.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.517
Sorry you
wasted your time.

38:39.552 --> 38:41.519
Where is it?

38:41.919 --> 38:43.921
I wish i knew.

38:44.322 --> 38:48.326
If you're lying
to me, i swear i'll
get it out of you.

38:48.361 --> 38:52.730
Soon as i make
sure you're safe
for questioning.

38:55.132 --> 38:58.736
You know,
you and i would make
an incredible team.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.138
That may have
worked with ames...

39:07.545 --> 39:12.315
but not with you?

39:12.350 --> 39:19.156
I ask for mulwray, ames
and the anomite and get this

39:19.557 --> 39:21.959
woman as a consolation prize.

39:21.994 --> 39:23.561
Is she safe?

39:23.961 --> 39:25.127
Perfectly.

39:25.162 --> 39:26.764
Well then,
miss templeton.

39:27.164 --> 39:29.567
Eckhart, we're
getting out of here.

39:33.971 --> 39:36.774
I assume you're not
talking about you and me.

39:38.776 --> 39:41.178
Have a seat.

39:47.985 --> 39:49.552
You know
something, darling?

39:49.587 --> 39:51.188
I would hate to leave
here empty-handed.

39:51.589 --> 39:53.190
Right. The money.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.757
Mr halloran.

39:54.792 --> 39:59.161
I know exactly
where it's stored.

39:59.196 --> 40:03.601
You both are making the
biggest mistake of your lives.

40:03.636 --> 40:06.003
Ta ta.

40:32.029 --> 40:34.797
Ohh.

40:34.832 --> 40:37.635
What are you guys doing?

40:38.035 --> 40:41.203
How long have i been out?

40:41.238 --> 40:42.840
Oh, just
about fourteen hours.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.407
Hmm.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.444
Oh, man, it feels
like fourteen days.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.246
Do you remember
anything that happened?

40:49.647 --> 40:51.248
Yeah,
unfortunately i remember
everything that happened.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.250
That was a pretty
low blow there, brennan.

40:53.285 --> 40:54.417
Yeah.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.253
I'm sorry.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.972
You okay?

40:58.007 --> 40:59.622
I'm fine.

40:59.657 --> 41:02.059
Besides,
it was my feeling that
were hurt more than anything.

41:02.094 --> 41:04.462
You're just lucky
she was still around
to save your butt.

41:04.497 --> 41:06.864
We're just glad
to have you back.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.866
Yeah,
it's good to be back.

41:08.901 --> 41:10.468
Hey, lover boy.

41:10.868 --> 41:12.069
How you feeling?

41:12.470 --> 41:13.671
Ah... like an ass.

41:13.706 --> 41:14.837
Oh, good.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.839
That's how you acted.

41:16.874 --> 41:19.677
Whatever happened
with the anomite?

41:20.077 --> 41:22.079
It's locked away where nobody
can get their hands on it.

41:22.114 --> 41:24.299
Well, i vote using
it against eckhart,

41:24.334 --> 41:26.484
find out all his
dirty, little secrets.

41:26.519 --> 41:27.650
Oh, no. No way.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.251
It would be like
opening pandora's box.

41:29.286 --> 41:31.288
Sooner or later the wrong person
would get their hands on it.

41:31.323 --> 41:34.091
I need to
get out of here, man.

41:34.126 --> 41:35.310
I'm dying of thirst.

41:35.345 --> 41:36.494
No, i'll get it.

41:36.529 --> 41:37.660
Stay there.

41:37.695 --> 41:38.896
That's a good idea.

41:39.296 --> 41:42.064
Let's all have
something to drink.

41:42.099 --> 41:45.302
Would you let
me and emma pick out your
girlfriends from now on?

41:45.337 --> 41:49.707
Yeah, just tell
us your type and we
will keep an eye out.

41:49.742 --> 41:51.674
Oh, let's see.

41:51.709 --> 41:54.111
Five-five to six foot,
blond hair/brunette,

41:54.146 --> 41:56.113
blue eyes/green eyes...

41:56.148 --> 41:57.680
you know what?

41:57.715 --> 42:00.117
You could be a
little bit more specific.

42:00.152 --> 42:02.136
No stingers.

42:02.171 --> 42:04.121
Come on.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.723
Ah,
slow down, slow down.

42:06.123 --> 42:07.324
Come on.
