00:05.830 --> 00:09.600
I don't want to argue with you!
I just want us to be happy!

00:09.950 --> 00:11.670
- What'd she say?
- What'd he say?

00:11.670 --> 00:13.590
- Huh? I can't hear.
- What?!

00:14.470 --> 00:16.620
Okay, okay... take 'em off.

00:17.830 --> 00:18.560
See?

00:18.590 --> 00:22.020
Not so easy to perform a scene when you
have a Bucket on your head, is it?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.260
- No.
- It's difficult.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.690
Yes.
Well... class dismissed.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.310
But...
We still have more time.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.690
We do? How much?

00:33.690 --> 00:35.080
Fifty-five minutes.

00:36.590 --> 00:37.660
Oh. Oh!

00:37.660 --> 00:41.300
Well, actually, I do have something
I need to discuss with some of you.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.600
Tori, Cat, Andre, Robbie, Jade... please stay.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.990
The rest of you may wander the halls.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.540
Enjoy your day.
Thanks for coming, I'm here all week.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.190
Tip your nurses and clowns.

00:59.210 --> 01:00.680
Why did you make them leave?

01:00.940 --> 01:02.760
Ah, I dunno.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.950
They never talk.

01:06.460 --> 01:09.260
Yeah, they just sit there and react.

01:09.260 --> 01:10.220
That's right.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.030
- You know, that's...
- They just don't talk.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.560
So, what do you want with us?

01:13.560 --> 01:15.260
Who like parades?

01:15.660 --> 01:18.130
- Antonio banderas.
- Hillbillies.

01:18.130 --> 01:18.900
No one.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.200
Oh c'mon. Parades are fun.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.770
One time my brother was in a
parade, but he was inappropriate,

01:25.780 --> 01:29.650
so the parade people called the police and
now he's not allowed to be in parades.

01:32.430 --> 01:34.410
Or be near horses.

01:36.790 --> 01:39.350
- Play with the pretty keys.
- Kay-kay.

01:40.890 --> 01:43.960
So... you all know about the
woman I've been dating.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.240
Felicia?

01:45.490 --> 01:47.190
- No, I don't.
- Never heard of her.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.330
Well, anyway, she's the creative director
of this year's parade parade.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.670
- Parade parade?
- I've never heard of that.

01:53.670 --> 01:54.770
Exactly.

01:54.770 --> 01:58.380
It's a parade to help raise
awareness of parades.

02:00.680 --> 02:04.240
Anyway, I sort of promised Felicia,

02:12.170 --> 02:15.460
Yes. So, who would like to...

02:19.420 --> 02:20.640
How 'bout the rest of you?

02:22.140 --> 02:24.010
Would you guys like to build a float

02:24.010 --> 02:26.010
and do a little song in the parade?

02:26.620 --> 02:29.780
Hmmm? For sweet daddy Sikowitz?

02:30.810 --> 02:33.210
- Nooooo...M- Naaaahhh...

02:34.180 --> 02:35.040
All right.

02:35.310 --> 02:38.540
If you don't want to be on national
television

02:39.070 --> 02:41.870
where all kinds of Hollywood producers

02:41.870 --> 02:44.920
and casting directors will see you...

02:45.660 --> 02:47.690
That's koodly-doo with me.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.710
- Wait.
- Yes?

02:51.930 --> 02:54.600
This parade's gonna be
on national television.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.640
Yep.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.000
- Well, if it's gonna be on national...
- Gimme my keys back.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.410
Where's my house key?

03:04.960 --> 03:05.810
Uh, unh.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.620
I'll take her to the nurse.

03:11.510 --> 03:13.860
- I swallowed it.
- We'll see it again.

04:17.959 --> 04:24.320
Trying to think of parade float theme = NOT EASY.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.480
Feeling: Thinkful.

04:33.130 --> 04:35.400
- Okay...
- Okay...

04:36.400 --> 04:39.320
Parade float. Ideas...

04:40.290 --> 04:41.390
What do we have so far?

04:41.900 --> 04:44.470
Let's see, oh, we have two...

04:45.630 --> 04:48.400
"A tribute to the fruits of Mexico"

04:49.950 --> 04:52.980
and "Need good idea for float".

04:53.740 --> 04:55.410
What was wrong with my idea?

04:55.990 --> 04:59.240
No one wants to see a parade float called
"The ladies of northridge".

05:00.580 --> 05:05.090
- Uhhh... well...
- Come on, guys, be serious!

05:05.090 --> 05:07.340
You wanna look dumb on national TV?!

05:09.690 --> 05:12.170
Who's gonna be on national TV?!

05:12.870 --> 05:14.890
We're performing in the parade parade.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.750
I'll do it!

05:17.980 --> 05:18.670
Trina...

05:18.700 --> 05:22.010
No seriously, I'll sing,
or dance, or I can just stand on the float,

05:22.010 --> 05:23.920
like, right in front
and just be the pretty girl,

05:23.920 --> 05:25.690
I can totally just be the pretty girl.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.750
All right, let's put it to a vote.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.370
- All those...
- No.

05:36.190 --> 05:38.290
Fine, I don't wanna be in it.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.670
I wouldn't be in it if you guys begged me.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.570
- Just lemme be in it.
- No.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.700
I don't even wanna be in it.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.510
Your sister just elbowed me in my lung.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.100
- I'll get you some ice.
- Sit down!

06:03.120 --> 06:05.400
I'm sorry, did someone invite you here?

06:05.600 --> 06:08.170
Beck told me you guys are
performing on national TV.

06:08.890 --> 06:09.690
So?

06:09.790 --> 06:11.820
And you think you're
doing that without me?!

06:11.890 --> 06:14.070
You stormed outta Sikowitz's class.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.670
I feel that Jade should be included.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.800
Okay fine, whatever.
So what's our float gonna be?

06:23.810 --> 06:25.580
Someone should just pick an idea.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.600
Okay, so who's gonna pick?

06:28.150 --> 06:33.210
Well, luckily, I have the new
pear pad app called spin-a-m'jig.

06:33.980 --> 06:34.910
Robbie.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.230
Let me just finish inputting our faces...

06:38.570 --> 06:42.120
And now... I stroke this, and
the wheel spins randomly

06:42.120 --> 06:43.820
until it lands on one of us.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.360
And that person gets to pick
what the float's gonna be?

06:46.490 --> 06:49.090
No Cat... that person
gets a kidney transplant.

06:50.690 --> 06:52.270
C'mon, let's just do this.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.860
- Yeah go.
- Okay, here it goes...

07:07.200 --> 07:09.430
I can't remember a time when this wasn't happening.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.120
I think it's almost done.

07:17.430 --> 07:20.720
Oh my God! It stopped on my face!

07:22.130 --> 07:25.040
So... you get to pick what
our float's gonna be?

07:27.270 --> 07:28.880
So... so...
What's it gonna be, Cat?

07:35.990 --> 07:37.670
A giant cupcake?!

07:39.920 --> 07:40.740
All right.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.480
We don't wanna wear these.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.080
Why don't you guys like your costumes?

07:55.210 --> 07:56.140
Wh..Why?!

07:57.600 --> 07:58.760
They're candy-jammies.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.290
They go perfect with our cupcake theme.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.460
Yeah, they do.
I think they're rad-cool.

08:06.330 --> 08:08.950
Yeah. They look adorable.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.920
Y'know she wants us all to wear 'em.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.590
I will pop your head like a zit.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.780
Graphic.

08:16.180 --> 08:17.590
Hiii!

08:17.910 --> 08:22.100
Oooh, your float is looking
gigantically delicious.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.990
I know.
It's pretty cool, huh?

08:24.060 --> 08:25.090
Indeed.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.330
You gonna finish in time?

08:26.330 --> 08:28.390
Yeah, we're gonna work
all night if we have to.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.660
- We'll get 'er done.
- Excellent.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.669
Felicia will be so exci...

08:42.919 --> 08:48.320
Our gigantic cupcake float is almost finished!

08:48.320 --> 08:52.200
Feeling: Frosted.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.010
And... This cupcake...

09:01.830 --> 09:02.810
...is done.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.100
Yee hoo!

09:06.070 --> 09:08.470
Yay! Cupcake power!

09:08.750 --> 09:13.310
- Woooo! Ha ha ha ha ha...
- Hey, Cat, Cat, Cat, Cat, Cat, Cat...

09:13.310 --> 09:14.840
- Yeah?
- You're killing me.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.290
- Time?
- Oh, it's um...

09:23.040 --> 09:24.700
One-twenty a-m.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.660
Okay, then we better get goin' now.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.520
We don't have to check in 'til seven.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.560
This thing only goes
like four miles an hour,

09:33.560 --> 09:35.430
and the parade is in Pasadena.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.730
If we leave now we'll
probably just barely make it.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.770
All right people... in the dessert!

09:41.770 --> 09:43.630
Let's go.

09:44.110 --> 09:46.170
Oh. Here are the
keys to the cupcake.

09:46.410 --> 09:49.610
Oh, no, no, no... I can't drive
that thing with you kids in it.

09:49.610 --> 09:52.920
I have a semi-suspended
driver's license.

09:54.430 --> 09:55.680
Why'd it get suspended?

09:55.900 --> 09:59.070
Well... see, I was driving through
Vegas

10:00.110 --> 10:04.030
with these people I met at the circus.

10:04.090 --> 10:06.610
- And...
- We'll let Beck drive.

10:08.010 --> 10:09.230
Circus people?

10:09.470 --> 10:11.400
One woman had an extra
finger on her left ha...

10:11.400 --> 10:13.180
- Let's not talk about it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.540
How do I see outta this thing?

10:20.690 --> 10:23.960
Oh, you just look through the periscope...
Right here.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.700
This seems dangerous.

10:29.740 --> 10:31.220
Ah, ya big baby.

10:31.770 --> 10:34.250
C'mon, let's get to that parade
before the sun comes up!

10:35.620 --> 10:38.220
She had six fingers on one hand?

10:39.230 --> 10:42.290
Yep... she could swim like a torpedo.

10:44.470 --> 10:46.970
Okay, hang on everybody.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.780
- Here we go!
- Oh.

11:00.780 --> 11:01.450
Ooh.

11:01.450 --> 11:02.710
Yay.

11:07.030 --> 11:10.180
- Are we moving?
- Yup, we're movin'.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.990
- Can't it go any faster?
- Sure.

11:12.990 --> 11:15.490
If we were being towed by something that goes faster.

11:23.090 --> 11:26.670
♪The wheels on the cupcake spin around ♪

11:26.850 --> 11:28.460
♪ Spin around, ♪

11:28.500 --> 11:29.740

11:48.690 --> 11:51.630

- Yeah, what street?

11:51.960 --> 11:54.010
Let's just say it ain't sesame street.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.370
I love sesame street.

11:56.710 --> 11:58.400
- ♪ Sunny... ♪
- No!

12:02.330 --> 12:03.180
Hey.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.050
Hey what's in that sack?

12:07.250 --> 12:10.680
- I don't know.
- Well, I swear it just moved.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.350
Owwwwwwwwww!!! Oh.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.390
Really?

12:15.390 --> 12:16.920
Trina?

12:17.330 --> 12:19.440
Thanks for kicking me in the mouth!

12:19.520 --> 12:21.240
Why are you in that sack?!

12:21.270 --> 12:23.550
So I can perform in the parade!

12:23.780 --> 12:26.500
- Right. How do...
- No one likes you.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.010
Yeah. You're a nuisance.

12:30.470 --> 12:33.110
- Hey, whoa.
- Oh my God.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.880
Dang.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.610
What was that?

12:37.350 --> 12:39.080
I think we got a flat tire.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.840
- This is fantastic.
- Wow. Good.

12:50.260 --> 12:51.480
Fun neighborhood.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.660
Yep... we got a flat tire.

12:54.930 --> 12:55.970
Do we have a spare?

12:56.750 --> 12:58.460
We don't even have a trunk.

13:01.470 --> 13:04.400
Hey. Here come some guys.
Maybe they can help us.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.440
Hey, fellas!

13:09.690 --> 13:10.880
Yeah.

13:12.330 --> 13:14.890
Maybe they can help us find a...

13:16.630 --> 13:18.950
- Back in the cupcake!
- Right behind ya! Go, go, go.

13:18.970 --> 13:20.050
- Go, go, go, go.
- Oh my God.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.500
- Open the door!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.420
Do you see anything?

13:32.790 --> 13:35.960
I see a guy on the sidewalk petting
a little dog...

13:37.550 --> 13:38.780
Wait, no...

13:39.010 --> 13:40.310
It's a giant rat...

13:42.270 --> 13:43.860
And he's not petting it,

13:45.290 --> 13:46.500
he's eating it.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.380
I'm gonna shut this.

13:52.270 --> 13:53.570
What time is it?

13:53.570 --> 13:56.230
Uh. Almost three a-m.

13:56.740 --> 13:59.470
And what time do we have to
check in to the parade by?

13:59.620 --> 14:00.900
Seven a-m.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.120
Which means we have to be there in...

14:05.230 --> 14:08.840
- Wait, lemme do it over again...
- Four hours!

14:10.990 --> 14:12.020
Four hours.

14:12.750 --> 14:13.770
Yeah, hi.

14:14.090 --> 14:16.600
We have a flat tire... could
you please send a tow truck?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.710
Great, thank you so much.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.810
We're on the corner of
spates and eighty-third.

14:23.490 --> 14:25.630
Yeah, how long do you think
it'll take for you to...

14:26.900 --> 14:27.430
Hello?

14:29.800 --> 14:30.510
Hello?

14:32.830 --> 14:33.650
He hung up.

14:35.130 --> 14:38.350
Man, nobody's gonna drive into
this neighborhood at night.

14:38.390 --> 14:40.250
Hey, Batman would.

14:41.050 --> 14:43.180
Do you have Batman's phone number?

14:43.520 --> 14:44.340
No.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.550
Then how we gonna call Batman?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.420
- We're not.
- I know we're not!

14:50.830 --> 14:51.720
All right.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.720
I think there's a twenty-four
hour price-co on spates.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.340
I'll jog up there, buy a tire,
and be back in thirty minutes.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.760
Uh, you sure you wanna be runnin' through
this neighborhood at three A.M.?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.220
The only thing I'm afraid of is fear

15:04.810 --> 15:06.450
and the guy who installed my satellite dish.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.100
I know he wanted to hurt me.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.520
I'm running away!

15:23.080 --> 15:29.080
Where is Sikowitz?!? Not liking this situation.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.400
Feeling: Scared.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.890
Man, Sikowitz has been hone for almost an hour.

15:41.130 --> 15:43.240
- I'm calling the cops.
- Yeah. That's a good idea.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.370
- I think you should do that.
- Yeah, do that.

15:46.770 --> 15:47.830
No signal.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.210
What happened? I had full bars a few minutes ago.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.580
I never have signal.

15:53.590 --> 15:55.450
You're still on mobile-tech?

15:55.470 --> 15:57.440
I signed a five-year contract!

15:57.800 --> 15:59.670
- No bars.
- Nothin'.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.210
- No bars.
- Why can't we get a signal?!

16:03.010 --> 16:03.820
Are you sure?

16:04.130 --> 16:07.290
Yeah, there used to be a cell
phone tower right up there.

16:08.810 --> 16:12.030
What kinda sicko steals a cellphone tower?

16:13.630 --> 16:16.780
Oh... oh... thank cheddar.

16:18.450 --> 16:22.650
Officers... I'm so glad to see you...

16:22.780 --> 16:23.780
Yeah.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.330
Where are your pants?

16:25.790 --> 16:27.320
They were taken by hooligans.

16:27.870 --> 16:30.860
They jumped me about a quarter mile back that way.

16:30.970 --> 16:31.880
And, uh?

16:31.920 --> 16:34.060
What are you doin'? Running around this
neighborhood in the middle of the night, huh?

16:34.270 --> 16:35.190
Oh.

16:35.540 --> 16:37.450
Well, I was on my way to the parade parade,

16:38.490 --> 16:41.760
riding along with a bunch of children in a giant cupcake...

16:41.790 --> 16:42.780
Uh-huh.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.210
...Now next thing I know,

16:44.510 --> 16:46.620
one of the cupcake's tires goes pop.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.400
And why are you taking out your handcuffs?

16:48.890 --> 16:51.070
I... I don't understand what's happening...

16:51.070 --> 16:52.130
Why are you arresting me...

16:52.140 --> 16:54.900
There are seven children in a cupcake who need me...

16:54.970 --> 16:56.980
- Help!
- There's no children in a cupcake.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.800
Yes. They're wearing candy pajamas!

16:59.850 --> 17:03.950
Heeeelp! Help me! Freedom!

17:05.819 --> 17:07.660
How long has Sikowitz been gone?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.069
Way too long.

17:09.130 --> 17:10.890
Okay, we can't just keep sitting here.

17:10.970 --> 17:12.410
Then let's hear a plan.

17:12.630 --> 17:15.310
Well... we have two guys
in this cupcake.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.750
I think they should go for help.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.770
Two guys?

17:19.010 --> 17:20.710
You know what I mean?

17:20.710 --> 17:22.290
Uh... I really don't.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.040
C'mon, why don't the two of you quit acting

17:26.050 --> 17:28.069
like a couple of daisies and get out there?

17:28.220 --> 17:31.610
- If we go out there dressed like this...
- We'll get torn apart!

17:31.940 --> 17:32.590
True.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.950
- Tori, you go.
- What?!

17:36.590 --> 17:38.710
- C'mon, let's just do it.
- Do it? But...

17:40.330 --> 17:41.340
Okay.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.370
Wait... do you even know which way
we should go?

17:45.420 --> 17:48.670
Well, according to pad map,
if you head due north

17:48.720 --> 17:52.400
for about... no, Andre, don't
do it, don't do it, aww...

17:52.890 --> 17:54.230
What did you do?

18:04.780 --> 18:07.440
OH, OKAY, SO YOU DIDN'T STEAL The cell phone tower.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.100
- Noooo.
- Then how come you had it?

18:09.140 --> 18:11.560
I was comin' home from church...
It fell one me.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.790
Oh, it fell on you.

18:12.790 --> 18:14.990
- That was...
- Okay, it fell on you.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.200
Hey, get back over here.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.210
- I didn't do anything...
- You asked some questions...

18:23.750 --> 18:24.740
You cut this last?

18:24.740 --> 18:26.020
I can't even lift it.

18:26.110 --> 18:29.100
The thing just fell the thing
just fell on the building kinda...

18:36.020 --> 18:38.450
- YOU SCARED US!
- Where's help?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.890
- We didn't get any!
- We got jumped by, like, six guys.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.890
And I swear, one of 'em was
wearin' Sikowitz's pants!

18:45.530 --> 18:47.130
What's happening?!

18:49.200 --> 18:51.980
- It's the dudes that jumped us.
- Hooligans!

18:52.860 --> 18:54.390
They're right outside?!

18:56.000 --> 18:58.500
Aw, man!
We're gonna die wearin' candy jammies!

18:58.650 --> 19:00.250
What do we do?!

19:00.940 --> 19:04.310
- The confetti cannon!
- Yes. Yes.

19:04.450 --> 19:06.190
Kay. Cover your ears!

19:15.370 --> 19:16.390
I think it worked.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.450
Hey... where's Tori?

19:26.860 --> 19:28.720
She went to look for you and Andre.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.300
She went out there?

19:30.300 --> 19:32.300
How'd you guys let her go
out there all by herself?

19:32.670 --> 19:34.180
Did you try and stop her?!

19:34.830 --> 19:36.590
- In a way.
- What'd you do?!

19:36.770 --> 19:37.680
I opened the door.

19:53.340 --> 19:54.140
Oh.

19:55.510 --> 19:56.430
Hello.

19:59.070 --> 20:00.380
Um...

20:01.730 --> 20:02.820
My name is Tori...

20:06.360 --> 20:07.430
Honor student...

20:09.160 --> 20:10.440
My name is Kevin.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.660
Wow.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.890
I used to have a hamster named Kevin.

20:17.820 --> 20:19.560
You've probably never had a hamster.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.960
Okay, here's the thing...

20:27.310 --> 20:30.750
See, my friends and I had a flat tire...
Back there in this...

20:31.540 --> 20:33.360
Well, it's hard to explain but... um...

20:33.700 --> 20:37.710
We just need some help
changing, you know, the tire.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.030
Do you guys know how to change a tire?

20:44.240 --> 20:44.950
Yeah.

20:46.650 --> 20:48.140
We know how to change a tire.

20:49.070 --> 20:51.340
We'll change it real good.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.310
Well, terrific.

20:58.160 --> 21:03.740
...And you wanna make sure these
lug nuts are nice and tight.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.270
There we go. Set her down.

21:08.370 --> 21:09.330
Comin' down.

21:14.050 --> 21:14.810
Good as new.

21:14.970 --> 21:17.630
Yay, thank you guys so much.

21:17.850 --> 21:19.120
How sweet are they?

21:19.530 --> 21:21.520
- Yeah.
- They're sweet all right.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.150
- Look at 'em.
- Sweet guys. Yeah.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.460
Hey, I wonder where Sikowitz is.

21:25.720 --> 21:26.540
I dunno.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.940
Think we still got time
to make it to the parade?

21:29.180 --> 21:30.330
I don't know, Andre.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.510
I have no way to tell time now.

21:34.420 --> 21:38.200
Wait... are you guys going
to the parade parade?

21:38.530 --> 21:40.710
Yeah. This is our float.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.030
So you're gonna be in the parade?!

21:43.350 --> 21:44.820
Yeah, we're performing.

21:45.590 --> 21:46.680
Whoa.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.920
Well, we were just gonna watch it on TV.

21:53.850 --> 21:55.180
Not hi-def, though.

21:58.230 --> 22:00.800
Well... do you...

22:01.160 --> 22:03.510
Wanna come to the parade with us?

22:04.270 --> 22:05.040
Could we?

22:07.870 --> 22:11.200
