WEBVTT

00:01.247 --> 00:03.647
Baby, I don't need no ashtray.

00:03.750 --> 00:07.652
The whole world's an ashtray
if I had that kind.

00:10.256 --> 00:11.655
Here we go again

00:11.758 --> 00:14.158
with the number one hit
in the country

00:14.260 --> 00:15.659
by the Five Heartbeats.

00:15.762 --> 00:18.094
These boys are
pretty, pretty, pretty

00:18.197 --> 00:20.665
because they've been
to Benny, Benny, Benny,

00:20.767 --> 00:22.667
and they're
number one, one, one.

00:22.769 --> 00:24.669
Have you gone to Benny Mullin's

00:24.771 --> 00:26.671
to get into the beauty contest?

00:37.216 --> 00:40.083
What do you think I am, Eddie...

00:40.186 --> 00:41.619
stupid?

00:44.590 --> 00:47.457
I know who Monroe is
and what he does.

00:48.728 --> 00:52.164
Hey, you ain't got your woman
in check, man?

00:54.100 --> 00:55.965
Uh...

00:56.069 --> 00:57.866
baby, I think

00:57.970 --> 01:00.803
you're overstepping your bounds
just a little bit,

01:00.907 --> 01:02.431
you know?

01:02.542 --> 01:05.102
I can't do this anymore.

01:05.211 --> 01:08.476
I can't sit back
and watch you destroy yourself.

01:08.581 --> 01:11.141
Come on, baby,
not in here, please.

01:11.250 --> 01:14.151
I just wanted
to let you know that...

01:14.253 --> 01:17.654
I packed my things, and...

01:17.757 --> 01:19.486
I'll be gone.

01:30.570 --> 01:31.935
It's showtime.!

01:32.038 --> 01:33.596
Opening Big Red's Soul Revue...

01:33.706 --> 01:34.832
Bird and the Midnight Falcons.!

01:34.941 --> 01:37.102
(Singing)

01:41.214 --> 01:43.546
(Ends)

01:43.649 --> 01:45.116
You're doing a great job
with the Heartbeats.

01:45.218 --> 01:46.776
You're late again, Eddie.

01:53.226 --> 01:56.127
I know what you been trying to do,

01:56.229 --> 01:59.130
but you ain't going to do it.

02:00.733 --> 02:03.964
See, Big Red done pulled
my coattail to you

02:04.070 --> 02:06.129
a long, long time ago.

02:06.239 --> 02:08.139
That's bullshit, Eddie.

02:08.241 --> 02:10.140
You're talking crazy, man.

02:10.243 --> 02:13.007
Yeah, I'm crazy
like a motherfucking fox.

02:13.112 --> 02:15.137
And you...

02:15.248 --> 02:18.149
I can see through your jive ass

02:18.251 --> 02:19.980
like glass, nigger.

02:20.086 --> 02:22.145
Eddie, you got it all wrong.

02:22.255 --> 02:24.155
Stealing my moves, my style.

02:24.257 --> 02:26.851
You're even trying
to riff like me!

02:26.959 --> 02:28.324
Why don't you get
your boy out of here

02:28.428 --> 02:29.793
and detox him?

02:29.896 --> 02:31.921
You want my spot, Flash? Hmm?

02:32.031 --> 02:34.591
Slum-dwelling, scum-sucking,

02:34.700 --> 02:37.100
slug-ass motherfucker!

02:37.203 --> 02:40.104
You want my spot, Flash? Huh?

02:40.206 --> 02:43.004
Well, you ain't going to get it,

02:43.109 --> 02:45.907
'cause you ain't got it.

02:46.012 --> 02:49.072
(Singing)

02:55.755 --> 02:59.122
(Ends)

03:02.228 --> 03:03.627
No word on Eddie?

03:09.235 --> 03:11.135
I can sing his parts.

03:11.237 --> 03:13.137
I know all his parts.

03:18.244 --> 03:19.643
OK, go ahead.

03:33.187 --> 03:34.085
Thank you.

03:51.539 --> 03:52.437
Eddie.

03:56.210 --> 03:58.007
Eddie, get up!

03:58.112 --> 03:59.670
Eddie, get up, damn it!

04:08.722 --> 04:10.781
Eddie, get up!

04:10.891 --> 04:12.552
And what is this shit?

04:19.733 --> 04:21.826
No, no.

04:21.935 --> 04:26.134
I did what I did tonight, man,
on purpose.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.969
jimmy, man, he's on some kind

04:28.075 --> 04:29.736
of motherfucking power trip
and shit,

04:29.844 --> 04:32.039
talking about replacing people.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.080
I just wanted to show
that motherfucker

04:34.181 --> 04:35.580
what time it was!

04:35.683 --> 04:36.911
You left us hanging

04:37.017 --> 04:38.917
because of shit
between you and Jimmy?

04:39.019 --> 04:41.579
jimmy, man, he don't know, man.

04:41.689 --> 04:43.680
He just think he know, but...

04:43.791 --> 04:45.088
That ain't got nothing to do

04:45.192 --> 04:47.592
with what we're
talking about, man!

04:47.695 --> 04:50.926
We talked about this drinking
and drug shit before.

04:51.031 --> 04:53.090
You said
you was going to quit,

04:53.200 --> 04:55.100
so we left you alone,
thinking you would calm down.

04:55.202 --> 04:57.432
just 'cause I have one...

04:57.538 --> 04:59.096
two, maybe two drinks sometime...

04:59.206 --> 05:01.902
What, I'm an alcoholic now?

05:03.043 --> 05:05.375
What happened to Baby Doll?

05:07.848 --> 05:10.112
You're worse than your old man.

05:10.217 --> 05:12.117
I'll kick your motherfucking...

05:12.219 --> 05:13.447
Get off him, Eddie!

05:13.554 --> 05:14.919
What you doin', man?

05:28.736 --> 05:30.897
Thank you,
but you didn't have to.

05:31.005 --> 05:33.565
I could have chased him
to the other side of the room.

05:33.674 --> 05:36.302
Oh, no.
You'd have never caught him.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.901
You enjoying the party?

05:39.013 --> 05:42.073
I'm here with
my girlfriend Janet.

05:44.184 --> 05:46.084
Yeah. I'm, uh...

05:46.186 --> 05:49.087
I'm the lead singer
in the Five Heartbeats.

05:49.189 --> 05:51.089
I put the shit together,

05:51.191 --> 05:54.126
and I write
most of the material.

05:58.699 --> 06:01.099
I didn't know it was you.

06:01.201 --> 06:03.101
Would you please excuse me?

06:04.872 --> 06:06.100
What's your name?

06:07.708 --> 06:09.437
Sandra Tillman.

06:09.543 --> 06:10.441
Hi.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.011

06:12.112 --> 06:14.945

06:16.216 --> 06:18.741

06:23.223 --> 06:24.588

06:24.692 --> 06:26.091

06:26.193 --> 06:27.785
We're going to be recording

06:27.895 --> 06:29.556
on our own record label.

06:29.663 --> 06:33.064
Now, you heard of
Berry Gordy and Motown.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.567
Leon and Lester...

06:35.669 --> 06:37.500
- 'Fro town!
- 'Fro town!

06:37.604 --> 06:40.072
Excuse me. Mr. Duck?

06:45.145 --> 06:47.079
Tanya Sawyer.

06:47.181 --> 06:49.581
You remember me.

06:49.683 --> 06:50.980
Yeah.

06:51.085 --> 06:54.521
So, have you written
any poems lately?

06:54.621 --> 06:57.590
Um...

06:57.691 --> 06:59.318
No. I've, um...

07:07.701 --> 07:09.601
Um...

07:09.703 --> 07:11.603
You want to get out of here

07:11.705 --> 07:13.798
and go somewhere and talk?

07:15.209 --> 07:16.403
Yeah.

07:16.510 --> 07:17.943
Let me tell my brother.

07:18.045 --> 07:19.603
He's upstairs, and, uh...

07:19.713 --> 07:21.112
just wait right here.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.611
No. See, I got a better one.

07:25.719 --> 07:28.779
How you keep an asshole
in suspense?

07:30.657 --> 07:33.217
Oh, you can talk now.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.726
Hey, how's it going?

07:34.828 --> 07:36.227
You're not leaving the party,
are you?

07:36.330 --> 07:38.059
No. I'm going toJ.T. 's room.

07:38.165 --> 07:39.564
Listen to this one.

07:39.666 --> 07:41.725
There was this king
and he had three daughters.

07:41.835 --> 07:43.564
He told the princes of the land

07:43.670 --> 07:45.399
that if you wanted my daughters...

07:45.506 --> 07:47.406
I need to talk to you, Big Red.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.066
Give me a minute.
Can't you see I'm talking?

07:49.176 --> 07:51.736
No! I need to talk
to you right now

07:51.845 --> 07:53.574
about my royalties

07:53.680 --> 07:56.080
and how you keep your books.

07:56.183 --> 08:01.086
My offce hours are
from 9:00 to 5:00.

08:01.188 --> 08:02.587
Fuck your offce hours!

08:02.689 --> 08:05.590
I need to talk to you
right now, motherfucker!

08:10.197 --> 08:11.926
Look at that!

08:15.335 --> 08:17.064
What are you doing, man?

08:17.171 --> 08:18.604
Excuse me, ladies.

08:18.705 --> 08:19.763
Excuse me.

08:19.873 --> 08:21.773
You don't talk back!

08:21.875 --> 08:23.866
Uhh! Aah!

08:23.977 --> 08:26.468
Huh?

08:26.580 --> 08:28.548
Aah!

08:33.220 --> 08:35.279
Open up the goddamn window!

08:35.389 --> 08:36.287
No!

08:36.390 --> 08:38.255
Yeah!

08:54.741 --> 08:56.140
Don't do this, Red!

08:56.243 --> 08:58.643
Don't do this to me, Red!

08:58.745 --> 08:59.643
No! Aah!

08:59.746 --> 09:00.644
Hit him again!

09:00.747 --> 09:02.408
Aah! No!

09:02.516 --> 09:04.143
Help! No!

09:07.020 --> 09:08.146
What about my books?

09:08.255 --> 09:10.155
What you want to talk about?

09:10.257 --> 09:11.349
Nothing! Please!

09:11.458 --> 09:15.121
What you want to talk about?

09:15.229 --> 09:17.163
Let me up!

09:17.264 --> 09:19.164
Bring him up. Come on, boy.

09:19.266 --> 09:20.597
Bring him in.

09:20.701 --> 09:22.168
Come back here!

09:22.269 --> 09:23.429
Let me up!

09:26.773 --> 09:31.107
Now, if you have
any other problems

09:31.211 --> 09:35.944
with your royalties
and my books...

09:36.049 --> 09:40.952
my offce hours are from...

09:41.054 --> 09:43.614
my offce hours are from...

09:43.724 --> 09:46.693
9:00 to 5:00.

09:46.793 --> 09:48.454
You know, something's wrong.

09:48.562 --> 09:49.961
You're sitting by yourself,

09:50.063 --> 09:53.294
there's a big party
going on upstairs for us.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.391
All the ladies
are asking about you.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.629
They don't care nothing
about me.

09:57.738 --> 10:01.299
They just want to be seen
with J.T. of the Heartbeats.

10:01.408 --> 10:03.968
j.T., that's always
been part of your rap.

10:04.077 --> 10:06.136
"Hello. I'm J.T. of the
Five Heartbeats. How ya doin'?"

10:06.246 --> 10:09.875
Yeah, I know, I know,
but I'm tired of that.

10:09.983 --> 10:11.473
I'm getting older, Duck.

10:11.585 --> 10:15.146
I don't want to be some old man
still chasing.

10:15.255 --> 10:18.315
I'm tired of being with
different women every night.

10:18.425 --> 10:20.325
It's like it's a drug,

10:20.427 --> 10:23.521
and I don't get nothing
out of it.

10:23.630 --> 10:25.154
Settle down,

10:25.265 --> 10:28.666
have some little kids
running around the house...

10:28.769 --> 10:30.669
No. I can't do that.

10:32.206 --> 10:35.107
It's like I don't know
what it is.

10:35.209 --> 10:38.610
I like being with different women
all the time.

10:38.712 --> 10:41.112
It's like I can't control myself.

10:41.215 --> 10:43.775
It's like I'm addicted.

10:43.884 --> 10:47.115
I don't know what to say.

10:47.221 --> 10:49.121
I mean, they got centers

10:49.223 --> 10:51.123
for drug addicts and alcoholics,

10:51.225 --> 10:52.624
but I don't know

10:52.726 --> 10:55.286
if they have any
dick-control centers.

10:55.395 --> 10:56.657
I'm serious, Duck.

10:56.763 --> 11:00.631
I'm serious too. You should go
to a dick-control center.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.134
"I'm J.T. Matthews,

11:03.237 --> 11:05.637
and I can't control my dick."

11:07.741 --> 11:08.799
Oh, man.

11:08.909 --> 11:11.139
What they going to do
to it, though?

11:11.245 --> 11:13.645
You just work
with some mannequins.

11:13.747 --> 11:15.305
j.T., it's like this, man...

11:15.415 --> 11:17.144
When the right woman
comes along,

11:17.251 --> 11:19.481
it's going to be right.

11:19.586 --> 11:21.645
You can't force it.

11:21.755 --> 11:24.986
Yeah. I know. You're right.

11:25.092 --> 11:27.458
This would make a great song.

11:31.198 --> 11:32.597
Yeah, yeah.

11:39.206 --> 11:42.107
When you have one
of those crumb snatchers,

11:42.209 --> 11:44.609
just name one after me, OK?

11:44.711 --> 11:46.269
Whoever gets married frst.

11:49.716 --> 11:51.274
I'll see you upstairs.

12:05.065 --> 12:06.123
jimmy!

12:06.233 --> 12:07.461
Man, what's so important

12:07.567 --> 12:09.125
it couldn't wait
until tomorrow?

12:09.236 --> 12:10.635
Eleanor's mad as hell.

12:10.737 --> 12:11.965
We had plans today.

12:12.072 --> 12:14.973
This ain't going
to take that long.

12:19.746 --> 12:21.646
Ha ha ha ha!

12:24.084 --> 12:25.142
Well...

12:27.754 --> 12:30.086
Hey, Eddie!

12:33.660 --> 12:35.525
jimmy.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.756
I wanted to talk to you,

12:37.864 --> 12:40.594
because I think
it's time for some changes.

12:40.701 --> 12:42.669
You've done a great job
with the boys,

12:42.769 --> 12:45.101
but now I think it's time

12:45.205 --> 12:49.039
for the boys to have
a more experienced manager.

12:49.142 --> 12:50.439
What's the joke, man?

12:50.544 --> 12:53.104
It's not a joke.

12:53.213 --> 12:55.909
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

12:56.016 --> 12:58.314
I'm talking about buying you out.

12:58.418 --> 13:00.682
Are you out of your fucking mind?

13:00.787 --> 13:01.776
No.

13:03.623 --> 13:07.024
I have a contract on Eddie.

13:12.232 --> 13:15.201
Eddie, what the hell
is this all about?

13:15.302 --> 13:18.635
jimmy, you know goddamn well

13:18.739 --> 13:20.900
what this is all about.

13:21.007 --> 13:23.635
Hey, baby...

13:23.744 --> 13:26.645
I don't need no manager
out there

13:26.747 --> 13:28.647
trying to replace me.

13:31.184 --> 13:32.913
You ain't out there

13:33.019 --> 13:35.920
singing and dancing every night.

13:38.191 --> 13:41.558
jimmy, you don't do nothing
but get paid.

13:47.534 --> 13:50.094
Same old Big Red.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.538
You're not taking
the Heartbeats from me.

13:54.641 --> 13:55.938
Eddie is the Heartbeats.

13:56.042 --> 13:58.943
The other guys can be replaced
with anybody. You know that.

13:59.045 --> 14:00.774
Besides, the other guys
can't go anywhere

14:00.881 --> 14:03.372
until they've paid me
for the cars and clothes.

14:03.483 --> 14:06.111
I got an even longer list
of expenses...

14:06.219 --> 14:07.618
studio time, promotions,

14:07.721 --> 14:09.621
your expense account.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.123
So, you see,
you really owe me, Jimmy.

14:12.225 --> 14:14.159
You're trying to muscle me?

14:14.261 --> 14:15.626
As a friend,

14:15.729 --> 14:18.562
I am trying to put some money
into your pockets.

14:18.665 --> 14:20.064
Look, I'm not Bird!

14:20.167 --> 14:22.135
You can't dangle me out some window
and expect me to go away.

14:22.235 --> 14:23.964
I'll take your ass
to court frst.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.470
I'll talk about
all the warehouses

14:26.573 --> 14:29.906
where you used to press
bootleg records of your own artists.

14:30.010 --> 14:32.069
Your two sets of accounting books,

14:32.179 --> 14:34.579
and a long list
of D.J. s taking payola.

14:34.681 --> 14:38.082
What kind of plans
did Eleanor make today?

14:38.185 --> 14:40.585
Eleanor...

14:40.687 --> 14:41.745
Eleanor.

14:43.690 --> 14:46.250
I really like Eleanor.

14:54.201 --> 14:57.136
Now, Red, this is
between you and me.

14:57.237 --> 14:58.761
Maybe.

15:21.394 --> 15:22.452

15:24.064 --> 15:25.463

15:28.235 --> 15:29.065
Nobody.

15:31.171 --> 15:32.570
jimmy.

15:34.174 --> 15:35.402
What's wrong?

15:36.676 --> 15:37.734
Nothing's wrong.

15:37.844 --> 15:40.745
Look, I'm going to
go down to the club

15:40.847 --> 15:44.749
and see if I can't sit in

would you, Craig?

17:04.830 --> 17:06.230
I'll make the call.

jimmy! Jimmy!

17:57.584 --> 17:58.710
Help me!

18:00.487 --> 18:02.580
What is a man?

18:02.689 --> 18:04.850
Someone who...

18:04.958 --> 18:07.017
will not walk away

18:07.127 --> 18:10.290
from life's responsibilities.

18:10.397 --> 18:11.455
jimmy Potter

18:11.564 --> 18:14.089
is a true example

18:14.200 --> 18:16.566
of what a man should be.

18:16.670 --> 18:18.103
Yes, sir.

18:18.204 --> 18:20.866
He will be missed dearly.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.498
Now...

18:22.609 --> 18:24.600
we will have a few words

18:24.711 --> 18:27.111
from someone who was
very close toJimmy...

18:27.213 --> 18:28.874
Mr. ErnestJohnson.

18:38.525 --> 18:40.891
I can't get up.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.393
It's going to be OK.

18:42.495 --> 18:43.427
Why?

18:43.530 --> 18:46.397
We will have a selection

I'm here.

19:39.552 --> 19:41.144
You shouldn't...

19:41.254 --> 19:43.848
Oh, God, you shouldn't be alone.

19:43.957 --> 19:45.390
Maybe sometime...

19:48.161 --> 19:49.628
How dare you?

19:52.232 --> 19:55.827
How dare you come here?

19:55.935 --> 19:58.165

Uh, everybody's been, uh...

23:23.710 --> 23:25.507
worried about you.

23:25.611 --> 23:28.136
I...

23:28.247 --> 23:32.081
decided I'm not going to...

23:32.185 --> 23:35.052
I'm not going to sing no more.

23:35.154 --> 23:38.988
Eddie, you can't stop singing.

23:39.092 --> 23:40.650
Everybody knows.

23:43.696 --> 23:45.596
It wasn't no accident.

with Big Red and Jimmy.

Didn't she look good, man?

26:22.221 --> 26:26.317
I think it's one of the best shows
we've ever done.

26:26.425 --> 26:27.619
What's wrong?

26:27.727 --> 26:30.218
The dance steps are too wild.
The clothes are too loud.

it's not about competing
with anybody.

26:57.690 --> 26:59.817
How come they don't call my name?

26:59.926 --> 27:02.087
Because you're doing
that same old, tired rap

33:53.505 --> 33:55.405
Every song is a hit!

33:55.507 --> 33:57.998
The third cut
with the high vocal.

33:58.110 --> 34:01.011
- I have to give it up, man.
- It wasn't all me.

34:01.113 --> 34:03.138
Your brother wrote
some serious stuff.

34:03.248 --> 34:04.613
Ta-da!

34:04.717 --> 34:07.117
We got a hit!

34:07.219 --> 34:08.117
- Shh.
- Shh.

34:08.219 --> 34:10.120
We have something to tell you.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.120
We got a surprise.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.781
What sounds like carriage,

34:12.891 --> 34:14.654
but starts with an "M"?

34:14.760 --> 34:16.091
Oh! Marriage!

34:16.195 --> 34:18.322
We're getting married!

34:18.429 --> 34:20.455
Are you?
Oh! Congratulations!

34:20.565 --> 34:21.793
Isn't it beautiful?

34:21.900 --> 34:23.128
Look at that!

34:23.235 --> 34:24.759
Give me a hug.

34:26.170 --> 34:27.797
What the fuck you doing?

34:27.906 --> 34:29.237
What's wrong with you?

34:29.341 --> 34:30.967
You don't even know her!

34:31.076 --> 34:32.304
She loves me and I love her.

34:32.411 --> 34:33.378
So what?

34:33.478 --> 34:37.141
This ain't got nothing
to do with you.

34:37.248 --> 34:40.116
just be happy for me.

34:40.219 --> 34:43.085
I mean, I told Mom
about it already.

34:43.188 --> 34:45.382
I'm gonna have a big wedding.

34:45.491 --> 34:47.755
Would you be my best man?

34:47.860 --> 34:48.757
Yeah. Sure.

34:48.860 --> 34:49.828
Cool.

34:51.563 --> 34:53.393
Congratulations.

35:00.005 --> 35:02.940
(Singing)

35:10.716 --> 35:12.775
(Ends)

35:12.885 --> 35:14.182
(Laughter)

35:17.456 --> 35:18.855
- Yay!
- Yay!

35:18.957 --> 35:20.788
And many, many more.

35:20.893 --> 35:24.420
Oh, don't bring
that sweetie stuff here.

35:24.530 --> 35:26.430
Same old Sarge, isn't he?

35:26.532 --> 35:28.432
All these gifts for me?

35:28.534 --> 35:30.866
We got even more in the car.
Tanya?

35:30.969 --> 35:31.867
Oh, sure.

35:31.970 --> 35:33.369
I'll go help her.

35:33.472 --> 35:34.871
How you doing?

35:34.973 --> 35:36.600
I need a cigarette.

35:36.709 --> 35:38.506
Sarge, nobody here smokes.

35:40.045 --> 35:42.843
Look in my jacket pocket.

35:45.851 --> 35:47.216
Get him a cigarette.

35:47.319 --> 35:49.719
Let you have this one
'cause it's your birthday.

35:49.822 --> 35:50.720
Really?

35:50.823 --> 35:52.085
Yeah, really.

35:52.191 --> 35:53.556
I got news for you.

35:53.659 --> 35:56.560
I've been smoking
ever since I've been here,

35:56.662 --> 35:59.062
and I have resisted the nurses.

35:59.164 --> 36:00.563
We can talk later.

36:00.666 --> 36:02.634
Yeah.

36:02.735 --> 36:06.136
I got to have a cigarette.
I can't stand this.

36:06.238 --> 36:08.638
When did they say you
was going to get out?

36:08.741 --> 36:10.641
You know when
you're getting out?

36:10.743 --> 36:13.143
I don't care when I get out.

36:13.245 --> 36:14.143
How come?

36:14.246 --> 36:16.146
With all the pretty nurses?

36:16.248 --> 36:17.146
(Laughter)

36:17.249 --> 36:19.274
But I'm having a good time.

36:19.384 --> 36:22.080
I'm having a good time.

36:28.994 --> 36:31.827
You look like you're ready
to kill somebody.

36:31.930 --> 36:33.830
What's the problem?

36:38.370 --> 36:39.394
What's up?

36:46.278 --> 36:49.509
I think Tanya's having an affair.

36:50.649 --> 36:52.139
Tanya? Please.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.309
With who?

36:55.621 --> 36:56.849
Choirboy.

37:02.161 --> 37:03.560
Are you crazy?

37:03.662 --> 37:04.560
I'm serious.

37:17.476 --> 37:20.104
You got proof?

37:20.212 --> 37:21.304
No.

37:27.286 --> 37:30.119
But I'm going to get some.

37:45.037 --> 37:48.200
(Thunder Rumbling)

38:13.131 --> 38:15.497
This is Lou Thompson
on WRON with Newsbreak.

38:15.601 --> 38:17.000
An early-morning fiire

38:17.102 --> 38:19.002
took the lives of nine people

38:19.104 --> 38:21.004
in an apartment building
on Jefferson and 2nd Avenue.

38:21.106 --> 38:22.505
Eddie King, Jr.,

38:22.608 --> 38:25.008
ex-lead singer
of the Five Heartbeats,

38:25.110 --> 38:27.510
was involved in
a shootout with police

38:27.613 --> 38:30.013
while trying to rob
a neighborhood liquor store.

38:30.115 --> 38:33.346
He was shot several times
and is listed in critical condition.

38:58.377 --> 39:01.403
(Thunderclap)

39:03.882 --> 39:05.281
I know you.

39:05.384 --> 39:06.783
Donald "Duck" Matthews.

39:06.885 --> 39:08.785
One of the Five Heartbeats.

39:08.887 --> 39:10.286
I got all your albums,

39:10.389 --> 39:11.788
been to all your shows.

39:11.890 --> 39:14.188
Can I have your autograph?

39:15.727 --> 39:18.127
This has been a good night.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.494
Two Heartbeats in one night.

39:20.599 --> 39:24.035
Yeah, your brother
just went upstairs.

39:24.136 --> 39:26.263
Could you sign under his?

39:27.539 --> 39:29.769
My wife won't believe this.

39:33.312 --> 39:35.280
I love your music.

39:41.753 --> 39:44.381
Thank... Thank you, thank you.

39:47.359 --> 39:50.590
Oh, wow. Wow!

39:53.932 --> 39:55.263
Oh.

39:55.367 --> 39:57.232
No more messages
through Choirboy.

39:57.336 --> 39:59.201
If you wanna get in touch with me,
you know how to reach me.

39:59.304 --> 40:01.704
I'm chasing you and using Duck?

40:01.807 --> 40:03.866
You tell me what's going on.

40:03.976 --> 40:05.375
I've been after you
all these years...

40:05.477 --> 40:07.377
Don't act like you don't know!

40:07.479 --> 40:09.470
You know what's going on!

40:09.581 --> 40:12.448
You tell me
what's going on right now!

40:12.551 --> 40:15.452
First you were going out
with each other.

40:15.554 --> 40:16.452
That's fne.

40:16.555 --> 40:18.955
But now you're
taking this too far.

40:19.057 --> 40:20.957
You're talking about
marrying my brother.

40:21.059 --> 40:22.959
I can't let you hurt my brother.

40:23.061 --> 40:24.460
You hear me? I can't.

40:24.563 --> 40:26.793
I want you to call Duck,

40:26.898 --> 40:29.093
and I want you to tell him

40:29.201 --> 40:31.362
this thing's off.
You hear me?

40:31.470 --> 40:32.732
Why?

40:32.838 --> 40:35.739
Because you don't love him,
that's why.

40:35.841 --> 40:37.103
I know.

40:37.209 --> 40:39.268
I been with you.

40:41.446 --> 40:44.745
You love me, baby.

40:44.850 --> 40:47.648
I love you,J.T.

40:47.753 --> 40:49.914
I love you.

40:51.690 --> 40:54.090
But I'm in love with Duck.

40:54.192 --> 40:57.127
I'm in love with him.

40:57.229 --> 40:59.720
There's a difference.

41:12.010 --> 41:14.137
If you really love him,

41:14.246 --> 41:17.340
you got to tell him the truth.

41:22.554 --> 41:24.647
I can't.

41:33.131 --> 41:34.098
Thank you.

41:34.199 --> 41:36.599
It's a very special moment
for all of us.

41:36.701 --> 41:39.101
I would like to thank
A&B Records

41:39.204 --> 41:40.603
for everything that they've done.

41:40.705 --> 41:43.105
I hope we can get one of these
every time we come out.

41:43.208 --> 41:44.607
It's really great.

41:44.709 --> 41:47.109
I just want to say I love you,

41:47.212 --> 41:48.804
Brenda and Monica.

41:52.417 --> 41:55.545
Wow, huh? Heh heh.

41:55.654 --> 41:58.521
I really don't know what to say.

41:58.623 --> 42:00.022
I just know

42:00.125 --> 42:02.525
that I couldn't
have done anything

42:02.627 --> 42:06.723
without four of
the most talented, warm,

42:06.832 --> 42:10.268
giving brothers
on this entire planet.

42:10.368 --> 42:13.895
They're the ones
that deserve this applause.

42:16.708 --> 42:19.768
These four gentlemen
opened their arms

42:19.878 --> 42:23.143
and embraced me
like I was a brother.

42:24.549 --> 42:27.245
That's why today is... special.

42:27.352 --> 42:31.311
A very, very happy occasion
for me...

42:32.824 --> 42:35.224
as well as a sad one.

42:35.327 --> 42:37.227
Um... it hurts me to announce

42:37.329 --> 42:39.661
that I'm leaving the group.

42:39.764 --> 42:42.528
(Gasps)

42:42.634 --> 42:45.034
I want to say thanks,
fellas, for everything.

42:45.137 --> 42:48.538
Uh, and thank you
for this gold album, A&B,

42:48.640 --> 42:51.040
and I hope
we have the same success

42:51.143 --> 42:52.542
on my new solo album...

42:52.644 --> 42:54.305
Flash... It's Lonely
at the Top,

42:54.412 --> 42:56.539
which will be
in your record stores

42:56.648 --> 42:58.275
in about two weeks.

42:58.383 --> 43:01.511
Well, God bless all of you and...

43:01.620 --> 43:03.485
thank you.

43:03.588 --> 43:05.215
(Applause)

43:08.627 --> 43:11.221
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

43:14.499 --> 43:17.127
You know, I thought
when I got this,

43:17.235 --> 43:20.466
I'd feel on top of the world,
you know?

43:25.043 --> 43:26.943
Today I just feel...

43:30.482 --> 43:32.074
uh...

43:32.184 --> 43:36.712
I was... I was at a party once,
and a, uh...

43:38.123 --> 43:40.250
music critic said,

43:40.358 --> 43:42.758
"Donald Matthews is going to be

43:42.861 --> 43:46.262
a great writer one day
when he suffers more."

43:46.364 --> 43:50.027
And I said to myself,
"What does that mean?"

43:54.072 --> 43:56.472
Now I know what it means.

43:57.809 --> 44:01.210
I'm on my way to becoming
a great writer,

44:01.313 --> 44:05.181
and I'd like to thank
two people in particular.

44:05.283 --> 44:07.114
My fancee...

44:09.654 --> 44:11.519
and my brother.

44:16.861 --> 44:18.055
My brother...

44:22.000 --> 44:23.900
who's always been the same

44:24.002 --> 44:26.800
selfsh motherfucker
since we were kids.

44:26.905 --> 44:29.806
Don't do this here.
What you talking about?

44:29.908 --> 44:33.776
I hope I get a deal like Flash 'cause
today's my last day as a Heartbeat too.

44:33.878 --> 44:35.436
Duck, don't do this. Duck!

44:41.553 --> 44:42.986
Thank you very much.

45:04.576 --> 45:09.104
(Singing)

45:21.726 --> 45:23.057
Dear Duck,

45:23.161 --> 45:25.061
I know it's been years,

45:25.163 --> 45:27.063
and we haven't been in touch.

45:27.165 --> 45:29.497
I miss your friendship
and laughter.

45:29.601 --> 45:31.501
I've invested a good portion
of my earnings

45:31.603 --> 45:34.003
from the group
into my father's church.

45:34.105 --> 45:36.505
The fiirst service
will be this Sunday.

45:36.608 --> 45:38.007
Will you please come?

45:38.109 --> 45:40.509
It would mean the world to me

45:40.612 --> 45:43.012
if we were blessed
with your presence.

45:43.114 --> 45:44.843
I love you. I miss you.

45:44.949 --> 45:46.678
Together forever, Choirboy.

45:46.785 --> 45:49.754
P.S. I have a special surprise
for you.

45:57.062 --> 46:00.327
How can any man say...

46:01.866 --> 46:04.232
that he loves God...

46:05.704 --> 46:08.366
whom he cannot see...

46:09.607 --> 46:13.043
and not love his brothers

46:13.144 --> 46:15.578
who he sees daily?

46:15.680 --> 46:17.204
- Amen.
- Amen.

46:17.315 --> 46:20.716
That's what I want to
talk about this morning.

46:20.819 --> 46:22.184
All right.

46:22.287 --> 46:26.690
- Love. True love.
- Yes, Lord.

46:26.791 --> 46:29.988
Unconditional love.

46:30.095 --> 46:33.462
For God so loved the world

46:33.565 --> 46:37.365
that He gave
His only begotten son

46:37.469 --> 46:43.635
so that we may have
life everlasting.

46:43.742 --> 46:45.539
This morning,

46:45.643 --> 46:51.138
I want to reaffrm our faith

46:51.249 --> 46:56.118
that God is alive

46:56.221 --> 47:00.123
and ready to heal and mend

47:00.225 --> 47:03.023
confused hearts.

47:03.128 --> 47:04.152
Yeah.

47:04.262 --> 47:06.093
- Amen.
- Amen.

47:06.197 --> 47:08.097
Before I come to you

47:08.199 --> 47:10.360
with the Word this morning...

47:10.468 --> 47:12.436
Praise the Lord.

47:12.537 --> 47:16.598
I would like the choir
to bless us

47:16.708 --> 47:18.073
with a song.

47:35.927 --> 47:37.827
(Singing)

48:01.286 --> 48:03.083
Take your time!

48:03.188 --> 48:06.021
(Continues)

48:47.599 --> 48:48.691
Yes, Lord.

48:48.800 --> 48:51.234
(Continues)

49:31.676 --> 49:34.008
(Ends)

49:34.112 --> 49:35.977
Hey, hey, hey. Ha ha!

49:36.080 --> 49:37.479
Choirboy!

49:37.582 --> 49:40.483
Ooh! So how'd you
like my surprise?

49:40.585 --> 49:41.984
Eddie looks great, man.

49:42.086 --> 49:43.485
Oh, yeah. Praise God.

49:43.588 --> 49:46.489
He's been with us four years now.

49:46.591 --> 49:47.489
Aw, man.

49:47.592 --> 49:49.526
Mmm! What's up, bubba?

49:49.627 --> 49:51.254
Look at you, man.

49:51.362 --> 49:54.263
How you doing, baby?
You look great, man.

49:54.365 --> 49:57.266
You look great, too.
Hey, Baby Doll.

49:57.368 --> 49:58.767
Duck, how you doing?

49:58.870 --> 50:00.303
Good. Look at you.

50:00.405 --> 50:01.804
Eddie King, Jr.!

50:01.906 --> 50:04.807
You'd be surprised
what a 1 2-step program

50:04.909 --> 50:06.308
over at Narcotics Anonymous

50:06.411 --> 50:07.810
will do for you.

50:07.912 --> 50:09.311
Praise the Lord.

50:09.414 --> 50:10.813
Praise the Lord, yeah.

50:10.915 --> 50:14.316
Seven days a week,
one day at a time.

50:14.419 --> 50:17.445
Living right.
No drugs, no alcohol.

50:17.555 --> 50:19.580
Hardly getting any, uh...

50:19.691 --> 50:20.953
Eddie.

50:21.059 --> 50:22.458
That's another...
another discussion.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.461
Let me rap to you a second.

50:25.563 --> 50:26.723
Excuse me.

50:26.831 --> 50:29.664
You know, uh,
I got this little group

50:29.767 --> 50:32.258
I'm managing now, you know.

50:32.370 --> 50:33.769
You managing a group?

50:33.871 --> 50:36.772
Yeah. The boys are bad, too.
They can warble.

50:36.874 --> 50:37.772
Whoa.

50:37.875 --> 50:39.775
Yeah, just one little problem.

50:39.877 --> 50:41.777
We're having the damnedest ti...

50:41.879 --> 50:44.279
We're having
the toughest time, uh...

50:45.516 --> 50:48.041
fnding some
decent material, man.

50:48.152 --> 50:50.177
Enough said.

50:50.288 --> 50:52.119
Whatever you need.

50:54.359 --> 50:56.259
So we're in business, man?

50:56.361 --> 50:57.760
This is Duck.

50:57.862 --> 51:01.263
Duck? Duck, you think you
could churn me out an album?

51:01.366 --> 51:02.333
Ah!

51:06.504 --> 51:08.335
Hey, man, uh...

51:08.439 --> 51:11.840
I heard what went down
with you and J.T.

51:11.943 --> 51:14.844
I ain't got nothing
to say toJ.T.

51:14.946 --> 51:18.848
No, no, no. Duck, man.
Hear me out. Please, man.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.544
People make mistakes, you know.

51:25.623 --> 51:26.885
I know.

51:29.694 --> 51:33.095
I think maybe you should
give him a call.

51:36.300 --> 51:40.566
You just, uh... think about it,
all right?

51:45.843 --> 51:47.242
Yo, Pastor!

51:47.345 --> 51:49.779
You ready to blasta?

51:49.881 --> 51:51.473
Ha ha ha!

51:53.885 --> 51:56.615
Wings out, wings out,
wings out, wings out.

51:56.721 --> 51:59.849
(Drones Like An Airplane)

51:59.957 --> 52:01.390
Now, how are you guys

52:01.492 --> 52:03.858
supposed to fiy like that, huh?

52:05.663 --> 52:07.062
Yeah.

52:13.771 --> 52:16.604
Daddy, who's that?

52:20.078 --> 52:22.478
Y'all go play with your mama.

52:24.449 --> 52:26.849
Duck, you heard what Daddy said.

52:26.951 --> 52:29.283
Would you get over here, Duck?

52:52.009 --> 52:53.533
I feel stupid.

52:56.247 --> 52:58.681
Whoever has kids frst.

53:00.985 --> 53:02.452
I missed you, Duck.

53:06.524 --> 53:07.388
Yo.

53:08.559 --> 53:11.494
Choirboy, what you doing
with the ribs?

53:11.596 --> 53:12.494
You put...

53:12.597 --> 53:14.121
- Charbroiled?
- Charbroiled?

53:14.232 --> 53:16.097
Charcoaled.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.065
Maybe you could manage us,

53:18.169 --> 53:21.070
'cause we gonna be hot.
Trust me.

53:21.172 --> 53:22.571
Tell him, Lester.

53:22.673 --> 53:25.073
All the other rappers
are in their 20s,

53:25.176 --> 53:27.076
but we're in our 40s.

53:27.178 --> 53:29.078
That's part of our hook.

53:29.180 --> 53:32.581
And the other part of our hook
is we rap...

53:32.683 --> 53:34.913
country and western.

53:35.019 --> 53:36.850
Whoo!

53:36.954 --> 53:38.012
Hi. I'm Donnie Simpson.

53:38.122 --> 53:40.420
Welcome to a very special
Video Soul.

53:40.525 --> 53:42.891
I'm going to kick this show off
with my favorite video.

53:42.994 --> 53:44.393
I love these guys.

53:44.495 --> 53:47.089
Here are Flash
and the Five Horsemen.

53:52.370 --> 53:53.701
(Singing)

53:57.041 --> 53:59.032
(Ends)

53:59.143 --> 54:03.944
UncleJ.T.,
we wanted to see Flash.

54:04.048 --> 54:06.448
j.T., the girls
are all so excited.

54:06.551 --> 54:08.951
They won't be watching Flash
in my house.

54:09.053 --> 54:10.486
Leave those kids alone.

54:10.588 --> 54:12.556
If they want to watch that,
it's OK.

54:12.657 --> 54:16.093
That's junk. That's not music. I can't
have them listening to that stuff.

54:16.194 --> 54:18.128
Show them what real music is.

54:18.229 --> 54:20.595
You ain't said nothing
but a word.

54:20.698 --> 54:22.791
Heartbeats, front and center!

54:30.975 --> 54:32.135
Eddie.

54:32.243 --> 54:35.735
Sure y'all want to hang
with old Eddie King?

54:39.650 --> 54:40.582
We're sure.

54:40.685 --> 54:44.485
(Singing)

54:53.965 --> 54:55.865
What you waiting on, Duck?

55:00.204 --> 55:02.104
I ain't sang in years.

55:02.206 --> 55:05.232
(Continues)

55:06.377 --> 55:07.867
You sure?

55:07.979 --> 55:10.038
Yeah, I'm sure.

55:10.147 --> 55:12.240
Fall in line, Girl Scout.

55:12.350 --> 55:14.375
You don't need me.

55:14.485 --> 55:17.682
I know that. You were always
the worst dancer anyway.

55:17.788 --> 55:20.154
The man had two left feet.

55:22.393 --> 55:24.293
I wasn't the worst dancer.

55:24.395 --> 55:27.057
Choirboy was.

55:27.164 --> 55:28.461
Get out of here!

55:29.500 --> 55:30.865
What was that?

55:30.968 --> 55:33.869
The year was 1 965.
It was summertime.

55:33.971 --> 55:35.370
It was fall.

55:35.473 --> 55:36.872
It was summer.

55:36.974 --> 55:38.373
It was fall.

55:38.476 --> 55:39.374
- Bet.
- Bet.

55:39.477 --> 55:40.876
Look, stand here, man.

55:40.978 --> 55:41.876
5... 6...

55:41.979 --> 55:42.877
Wait, wait.

55:42.980 --> 55:44.379
This one, this one.

55:44.482 --> 55:45.380
OK, OK.

55:45.483 --> 55:47.246
5... 6... 7... 8.

55:47.351 --> 55:48.750
(Continues)

55:53.324 --> 55:54.723
Stay on it.

55:54.825 --> 55:56.190
Keep it up.

56:13.411 --> 56:16.437

57:17.208 --> 57:20.109
