WEBVTT

00:04.600 --> 00:06.520
Let the fun commence.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.920
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:14.240 --> 00:18.200
'Eight new, unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:18.280 --> 00:21.160
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.160
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:25.240 --> 00:27.920
My arse fell out of my shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:28.000 --> 00:29.960
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:30.040 --> 00:32.920
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:33.000 --> 00:36.720
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:36.800 --> 00:38.520
(cheering)

00:41.400 --> 00:44.240
'Some exes want romance.'

00:44.320 --> 00:46.560
I do really, really love him.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.040
'Some want revenge.'

00:49.120 --> 00:52.400
(screaming)
Let go now!

00:52.480 --> 00:54.600
No one fucking likes you!
See you later.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.720
'And others just want
to wreck the gaff.'

00:57.800 --> 01:00.640
(shattering)

01:02.040 --> 01:03.840
That'll be someone's head.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.360
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment.'

01:07.440 --> 01:09.760
Gonna be fireworks.
'Causing misery.'

01:09.840 --> 01:12.080
(crying)

01:12.160 --> 01:14.240
You will never, ever have me again.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.080
'Mayhem.'
Fucking dickhead.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.800
(screaming)

01:17.880 --> 01:20.040
'And madness.'

01:20.120 --> 01:22.920
'It's gonna get explosive.'

01:23.000 --> 01:25.080
You fucking what?

01:28.160 --> 01:30.440
'Six exes have already arrived.'

01:31.880 --> 01:35.040
I hate her guts.
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.520
My heart is breaking.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

02:03.720 --> 02:08.479
I woke up this morning, and it's
so nice that Ross is next to me.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.680
I'm not gonna lie, I'm seriously
sexually frustrated now.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.280
Hopefully tonight's the night.
I don't think he's like other boys.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.280
I don't think he's after one thing.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.240
Harriette's really nice
and she's fucking hot.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.200
If she won't put out,
I don't know how long it will last.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.920
I'm gonna get seriously bored.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.320
Being in this villa with Adam
is intense.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.040
I weren't expecting him to be here

02:34.120 --> 02:36.520
and be so involved in
everything I do.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.040
He's making it really difficult
for me in here.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.640
Like, really difficult.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.800
I need to have a conversation,
find out what the fuck's going on

02:47.880 --> 02:50.200
and why he's always
in my fucking grill.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.800
Seeing Nicole, I admit my old
feelings have come back up.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.320
I still think there's
unfinished business.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.520
But she don't like to admit
that she still cares about me.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.040
Last night, Adam came up to me
and tried giving me a bit of advice

03:03.120 --> 03:06.640
about Nicole, but I think he's
gonna try and swoop back in there.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.400
I don't trust Adam at all. I've
known the guy, what, two minutes.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.400
I've woke up this morning with
the biggest fucking hard-on ever.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.120
I had a neck on
and a cheeky little finger,

03:18.200 --> 03:22.000
but I didn't fly in on a helicopter
to just get my fucking fingers wet.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.400
Things are progressing
with me and Aaron,

03:24.480 --> 03:26.560
we did have a bit of
a touch and feel.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.520
I definitely want to get to know him
a bit more eventually.

03:34.720 --> 03:38.520
I do like Harriette, but I'm
just getting frustrated, man.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.320
Ross is going to bed with Harriette
every night and getting no action.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.280
He's probably looks at me
and Zahida, has a Tommy Tank.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.520
She's like, "I want to stay
in the penthouse with you."

03:48.600 --> 03:50.640
Then she just
wanted to eat some food.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.440
Feel like I'm in an old marriage.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.960
I take my teeth out,
she puts her tracksuit on

03:55.040 --> 03:57.120
and we have a little cuddle.
It's shit.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.320
'With a sex drought in the villa,
will the floodgates open

04:02.400 --> 04:07.000
when the next ex washes up
on the beach? T minus two hours.'

04:11.480 --> 04:13.440
(tablet chimes)

04:13.520 --> 04:15.440
(all groan)
Fuck's sake.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.440
Why don't you just fuck off,
Tablet of Terror?

04:18.519 --> 04:21.040
'You might wanna put that comb down,
Aaron.'

04:21.120 --> 04:24.560
"Things have been getting too
comfortable lately in the villa,

04:24.640 --> 04:27.800
but there's a storm coming.
Maisie, Aaron and ZaraLena,

04:27.880 --> 04:31.680
it's beach time.
The next ex is almost here."

04:31.760 --> 04:35.320
My heart's just sunk.
Aaron and Zara.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.160
I'm dreading this, like. Fuck!

04:37.240 --> 04:38.520
Feel a bit sick.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.400
Not only am I potentially
gonna see an ex on the beach,

04:41.480 --> 04:44.840
I have to sit with my ex already,
with a girl he's seeing.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.360
'With Nicole and Adam's relationship
well below par,

04:49.440 --> 04:52.240
the Tablet of Terror
has sent them on a golfing date

04:52.320 --> 04:55.320
to see if they can play
a little nicer with each other.'

04:55.400 --> 04:58.760
I am so fucking shit at golf.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.160
Wow.
(both laugh)

05:04.240 --> 05:05.560
We're doing mini golf.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.480
It's not a normal place
I'd take a girl on a date,

05:08.560 --> 05:11.080
but I'm happy to spend
alone time with Nicole.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.240
Oh! (laughs)

05:14.720 --> 05:16.040
Hit it like I do. Come on.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.600
You have to calculate...
Hurry up.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.520
I wanted to get mini gold over with,
so we could chat.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.320
Cos all we've been doing
is having major arguments.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.040
Shall we go and chill now?
I'm actually sweating.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.600
I'm pretending to have a good time.
I just wanna get off my chest

05:30.680 --> 05:33.480
how I feel to Nicole
and find out how she really feels.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.720
So, was the reason that you
come here because you wanted to try

05:37.800 --> 05:39.080
and get back with me?

05:40.600 --> 05:44.840
Well, initially...
I did come here to have fun, but...

05:46.320 --> 05:49.320
...seeing you has made it... hard.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.440
I love you, but I didn't know
how you'd have reacted,

05:54.520 --> 05:57.640
if you was gonna pie me
or make me look like an idiot.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.560
I find it quite hard to
reveal my feelings to anyone,

06:00.640 --> 06:02.160
I'm quite a closed person.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.680
So, for me to tell Nicole how I feel
was a big thing for me.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.040
Do you still love me?

06:11.520 --> 06:15.120
This is really hard because I can't
say we can be more than friends

06:15.200 --> 06:17.480
because then I'm gonna be
lying to him.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.240
Obviously I do love you
and I do care about you.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.640
I'm not in love with you because
we've been split up for six months.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.160
He was a massive part
of my life and, you know,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.560
I'm not just gonna make him
feel like shit,

06:31.640 --> 06:33.240
like I don't give a shit.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.760
We need to work on our friendship.
And I feel like we've lost that.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.720
As long as we're still friends and
when I see you, we're not arguing...

06:40.800 --> 06:42.920
Yeah.
...that's all that matters.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.320
At the moment, I'm saying I just
want this to be a friendship,

06:46.400 --> 06:49.040
but I don't. I wanna see
if we can rekindle things

06:49.120 --> 06:50.720
and go back to how we used to be.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.600
The situation with me
and Nicole's fucked, mate.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.400
She's saying to me, "I like you

06:59.480 --> 07:02.680
and I don't want you to
crack on with anyone else."Yeah.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.360
She's on a date now with Adam.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.240
I hope Adam and Nicole don't
crack on with each other.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.440
If they do,
it's the end of me and Nicole.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.920
That's why, with the whole Harriette
thing, I'm not trying to pursue it.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.960
Yeah, you just want some
good looking girls to come in.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.080
I just want some fit birds
to crack on.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.000
Harriette's chosen her bed,
so she can lie in it now.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.800
I hope a couple new birds come in,
liven it up a bit.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.320
It's all gone a bit dry in here.
Fuck it, let's have a good night,

07:28.400 --> 07:31.240
hope a few fresh birds come in.

07:32.760 --> 07:37.360
'Over at the beach of doom...
it's squeaky bum time.'

07:37.440 --> 07:40.320
Oh, I am fucking dreading this,
like.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.240
Shitting my fucking pants here.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.880
You're thinking Becca, aren't you?
Becca.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.000
When me and Becca broke up,
I took it really fucking bad.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.360
I couldn't get over the fact
that someone said they loved us,

07:51.440 --> 07:54.560
then just moved to Australia.
I still don't fucking get it.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.400
I think it's Lewis.
If it's a lad, I'll do a backflip.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.600
Me and Aaron are getting closer.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.440
It's a two out of three chance
it's one of our exes. Fuck.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.920
(moans)
The best situation for me today

08:07.000 --> 08:09.440
would be Zara's ex
coming out of the water.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.680
She's cracked on with my ex,
so it's my fucking turn.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.840
Fuck this.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.680
Fucking hell.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.840
I think it's yours, babe.
Is she blonde?

08:42.880 --> 08:46.000
Fucking hell. My ex Becca's
just walked out of the water,

08:46.080 --> 08:47.480
and I can't even look at her

08:47.560 --> 08:49.760
cos my arse just fell
out of my shorts.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.040
You all right, darling?

08:52.120 --> 08:53.720
Maisie.
Hi, nice to meet you.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.200
I'm obviously gutted.
She's beautiful and she's got class.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.120
All right, Aaron?
How's it going?

08:59.200 --> 09:01.440
Yous all right?
Yeah, I'm good. Are you?

09:01.520 --> 09:02.520
Oh, God.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.600
Are you not happy to see us?
It's just weird.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.920
Like, I just haven't seen you
for a year and a half.I know.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.240
How was it all left, then,
with you guys?Wasn't left at all.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.960
It's unfinished business.Becca
was the girl I was besotted with,

09:16.040 --> 09:18.560
and seeing her face again
has just brought back

09:18.640 --> 09:22.440
a whole load of fucking memories.
I felt you put all the blame on me.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.960
I think you could have
done it a different way.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.520
To up and leave?
I could have, yeah. But I was 22.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000
I was a fucking selfish
little prick.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.600
I'm Becca. I'm feisty,
I'm fun and I'm fucking mental.

09:34.880 --> 09:39.240
I might look all cute and innocent,
but once I blow, I fucking blow.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.040
Me and Aaron were on and off
for about a year and a half.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.400
It was either unreal or crazy.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.760
So I did what any
sensible person would do,

09:47.840 --> 09:50.960
booked a one-way flight to
Australia and didn't tell him.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.560
Aaron is the love of my life.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.200
There's unfinished business between
us and I need to sort that out.

09:56.280 --> 10:00.320
But if someone catches my eye,
I might have a bit of fun first.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.160
So, howay then,
tell me what's gone on.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.640
I would be hurt and fuming
if Aaron's getting with someone.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.360
Nah, I wouldn't have it.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.040
If my car was at the end of
the beach, I'd get in it

10:11.120 --> 10:13.720
and fucking drive
straight back to Newcastle.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.080
So, howay then,
tell me what's gone on.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.680
Yeah, I slept with Aaron.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.600
And then me and Zara
have been getting together.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.840
Fucking hell.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.840
Aaron's been getting with Zara.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.920
I'm turning into a jealous psycho.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.720
Are you looking to sort of
get Aaron back?Who knows?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.280
There's obviously still
some emotion there.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.760
That could jeopardise anything
for me and him in the villa.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.480
Will you lose your head
if she gets with someone?

10:48.560 --> 10:51.240
She can do what she wants,
but we need to have a chat.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.520
There's a lot to be said
before we get back.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.160
I don't know who looks more worried,
me or Zara.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.680
Nice to see you,
but it couldn't be more weird

10:58.760 --> 11:02.240
sitting with a girl I'm getting
with and a girl I've had sex with.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.000
All right, stop it, man. Jesus.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.320
I was all right two minutes ago,
but now I'm fucking fuming.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.280
'Well, this isn't gonna help.'
(tablet chimes)

11:10.360 --> 11:13.120
Fucking hell.
I am fucking dreading this.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.400
"Welcome, Rebecca."

11:14.480 --> 11:17.800
"You're going back to the villa
to tell your side of the story

11:17.880 --> 11:21.880
whilst Aaron and ZaraLena are on a
date to move on to the next chapter."

11:21.960 --> 11:23.800
(groans)
For fuck's sake!

11:23.880 --> 11:27.040
We haven't even had two minutes
to sit together and chat.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.000
This is a fucking joke.
What are you getting upset for?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.080
Cos I am.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.560
Knowing yous are gonna be swanning
off wherever yous are going.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.440
Well, this is fucking awkward.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.760
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm a little bit gutted

11:38.840 --> 11:42.080
cos I wanted to speak to Becca
and get everything on the table.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.040
I can't deal with this, me, like.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.920
I've only been here two minutes.
Fuck. Glad you're feeling all right.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
What have I said?
You look all right.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.640
I'm not fucking speaking.
All right, calm down.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.480
I'm not fucking saying a word, am I?
Fuck's sake.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.280
Looking at Becca, I'm not gonna lie,

11:58.360 --> 12:00.560
she still means
the fucking world to us.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.360
And I'm a bit nervous that
when she gets in the house,

12:03.440 --> 12:05.640
all the boys are gonna
crack on to her.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.520
Right, what the fuck are we
gonna say to each other now?

12:10.600 --> 12:14.320
It's just gonna be awkward as shit.
What would you do if they kissed?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.040
Before you guys have spoken.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.480
Like, do you know what? I...
(groans)

12:18.560 --> 12:19.640
I don't know.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.080
'Don't worry, Becca, he's only going
on a massage date with ZaraLena.'

12:25.160 --> 12:28.680
(laughs) Oh, my God.
Oh, for fuck's sake.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.000
'Wonder if there'll be
a happy ending.'

12:31.080 --> 12:32.080
Oh, my God.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.440
Don't get me wrong, I really
wanna spend more time with Aaron,

12:35.520 --> 12:39.200
but after seeing his reaction
when Becca cam onto the beach,

12:39.280 --> 12:41.800
I wanna know how I stand
in this situation.'

12:41.880 --> 12:44.480
Someone that I haven't seen
for nearly two years

12:44.560 --> 12:49.560
has just walked back in. So it's
just fucking, like... It's weird.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.320
I'm not gonna lie,
my head is fucking up my arse.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.800
Did you say it was a year
and a half you were together?

12:57.880 --> 13:01.120
Wasn't a perfect relationship.
Year and a half wasn't solid.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.920
Zara's asking about
my relationship with Becca,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.200
and I don't even know how I feel.
I'm not gonna mug Zara off.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.640
She's a really nice girl.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.640
Nothing's changed as far as
I'm concerned. She left me.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.920
If I left her, this would be
a totally different situation,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.720
but I still need a chat with her.
He's been loyal to what he's told me.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.000
I've no reason to doubt him.
Me and Zara, I'm not gonna neck on

13:22.080 --> 13:25.280
out of respect for Becca.
And then if or when me and Zara

13:25.360 --> 13:28.720
take it to the next level,
that will happen after the chat.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.880
'Back at the villa,
Josh is anxiously awaiting

13:34.960 --> 13:38.280
the return of Adam and Nicole
from their golf date.'

13:38.360 --> 13:40.920
Hands up if you think
that they've cracked on.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.760
Sorry to say, but yeah.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.560
I think it's a 50/50 chance
on Nicole getting back with Adam.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.360
I'm a bit worried cos they have
a strong history between them both.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.880
(cheering)

13:54.960 --> 13:57.360
Did yous neck on?
No, we did not neck on.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.960
No, we're not seeing
each other again.Yeah!

14:00.040 --> 14:02.440
I think that's
what you call friend-zoned.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.160
Any chance of you two
ever getting back together?

14:05.240 --> 14:07.480
No, I'm not looking to
get back with Adam.

14:07.560 --> 14:11.360
He's so far in the friend zone,
he may as well plait her hair.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.040
I've got so much going on
that I need to sort out,

14:14.120 --> 14:19.240
I can't even think about getting
with anyone. Adam, Josh, anyone.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.200
Are you fucking serious?

14:22.280 --> 14:25.440
Just when Josh thought he'd
get somewhere with Nicole,

14:25.520 --> 14:29.280
she's proper mugged him off.
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.920
'Not to worry, boys,
there's a new arrival in town

14:34.000 --> 14:35.960
who might just cheer everyone up.'

14:36.040 --> 14:38.400
Who's this?
Oh, my God!

14:38.480 --> 14:39.720
Hey!
Oh!

14:39.800 --> 14:42.560
Oh, my God. She is well fit.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.320
Hiya, darling.
Hey!

14:44.400 --> 14:48.240
Becca is my best mate, best mate.
I'm really pleased to see her.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.520
How you doin'?

14:49.600 --> 14:53.880
She's fucking fit, mate. She's the
best bird that's walked in here.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.720
Absolutely gorgeous.
Are you fucking joking?

14:56.800 --> 15:00.440
Every single guy on the table
has just gone...

15:00.520 --> 15:04.160
All the boys are like dogs on heat.
Their tongues are hanging so low,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.520
they're licking their own
erect penises.

15:08.160 --> 15:11.560
So, what I wanna know is, what's
been going on with Zara and Aaron?

15:11.640 --> 15:14.280
I've heard he got a
cheeky finger in last night.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.600
Straight away, Becca's face drops.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.080
Aaron's been fucking
finger blasting Zara

15:19.160 --> 15:21.120
and Becca is not looking happy.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.160
On the scale of one to ten,
how pissed off are you? Ten.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.560
(laughs)

15:25.640 --> 15:28.360
Do you feel threatened by her?
Do I fuck? Course not.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.200
I wouldn't either.
I wouldn't. You're better looking.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.720
Becca's been in the villa
for two minutes

15:34.800 --> 15:37.960
and apparently she's the best thing
since sliced bread.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.240
Guys, play it cool for fuck's sake.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.160
Which guy do you fancy, may I ask?
Fuck off, you dickhead.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.000
(laughter)
Definitely not me then, is it?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.080
(laughter)

15:48.160 --> 15:52.120
Becca's got a bit of a feisty side.
This girl is a bit of me.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.600
I've got a question for the guys.
Which guys fancy her?

15:55.680 --> 15:58.920
Hey, I'll have you. (laughs)
Straight up! I'll have you.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.960
Jack fancies Rebecca.
Harriette's face drops.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.640
It's like a melted candle,
it just sinks.

16:04.720 --> 16:09.440
An OK bird walks in and Jack's
all over it like a dog on heat.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.560
'As Becca slips into
something more comfortable,

16:15.640 --> 16:17.880
it seems the boys are
clearly impressed

16:17.960 --> 16:20.200
by her art of conversation.'

16:21.240 --> 16:22.520
(laughter)

16:26.760 --> 16:28.000
Oi.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.360
(laughter)

16:31.600 --> 16:35.800
'You're all laughing now, but those
smiles will be wiped off your faces

16:35.880 --> 16:38.240
when the next ex arrives.'

16:38.320 --> 16:41.040
'Whose ex is next?'

16:41.120 --> 16:42.440
(evil laugh)

16:45.400 --> 16:48.280
So, babe, have you come
back here for Aaron or what?

16:48.360 --> 16:50.720
No, I've came here
to make amends with Aaron.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.520
But then I'm like,
eh, I've seen him. Hey!

16:53.600 --> 16:55.280
The boys are dead welcoming.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.400
That Jack guy stood out
straight away.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.040
I was like, you're fit
with that cockney accent.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.840
I do think you two suit.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.160
I'm glad someone's come in
who you like.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.359
No-one else liked her, did they?
(they laugh)

17:08.760 --> 17:11.560
He loves it.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.319
Go on, our kid! Go on, son!
(gasps)

17:15.400 --> 17:18.400
Hey, Aaron's gonna...
(indistinct) ...to death.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.839
Aaron's gonna come back with Zara,
he is not gonna be happy.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.480
After kissing Becca, straight away
I looked around at Harriette

17:25.560 --> 17:27.480
and she's definitely jealous.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.200
What I want to know, yeah, is Jack
a better kisser than Aaron? Yeah.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.680
(cheers)

17:32.760 --> 17:35.280
I'm getting the impression
Becca is an easy lay,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.840
which to be honest,
is brilliant for me

17:37.920 --> 17:41.560
because it gives Jack about five
minutes to stop thinking about me.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.800
Nice shorts, man.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.200
(cheering)

17:45.280 --> 17:48.840
How was your little date?Zara
and Aaron rock back into the villa,

17:48.920 --> 17:51.360
straight away, awks.
How was it, Zara?

17:51.440 --> 17:53.760
I would have preferred
if you two had a chat

17:53.840 --> 17:57.640
before that happened cos, obviously,
we couldn't relax.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.080
I've gotta throw something
on the table.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.760
I seen two people neck on.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.600
(laughs)

18:06.680 --> 18:10.000
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not really bothered, mate.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.760
Who was it, you?
It was me, it was me.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.760
No bother.
We had a little neck earlier on.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.440
She's single.
Aaron, stop kidding yourself.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.560
Just admit your fucking feelings.
Man up, you pussy.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.920
Would've been nice to chat first,
but...

18:25.000 --> 18:27.320
But what?
You've been fingering her.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.160
Were you here?
It doesn't matter.

18:30.240 --> 18:35.080
Everyone's been telling us about it.
So fuck? You weren't fucking here.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.440
So fucking what?!

18:36.520 --> 18:38.760
You necked on with my Jack,
it's all good.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.280
Your Jack? OK.
Yeah, my Jack.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.760
Who do you fancy most
in the villa now?

18:43.840 --> 18:45.760
Zara.

18:45.840 --> 18:49.360
On the date, out of respect for you,
we didn't even have a neck on.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.560
We didn't. I walked in,
and you'd necked on with Jack.

18:52.640 --> 18:56.120
Oops.I think you two need to
go and have a chat by yourselves.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.920
All day I've been on
a date with Zara,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.200
but Becca has been
in the back of my mind.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.640
I knew I was gonna
have to face the music.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.680
You haven't even hesitated
to neck on with someone.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.760
Yeah, but we've had a drink, man.
I don't give a fuck.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.200
Well, I do.
I don't care.

19:17.280 --> 19:21.200
I wasn't expecting to walk in, she's
necked on with a lad straight away.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.160
That has fucking hurt us.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.440
At the fucking table,
you just went, "I fancy Zara."

19:29.520 --> 19:31.760
How do you think that made me feel?

19:31.840 --> 19:35.480
I've just been on a date with her,
I'm not gonna go, "I fancy Becca."

19:35.560 --> 19:36.560
Am I?

19:36.640 --> 19:39.040
Becca is the only girl
I've ever loved.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.440
It took us months and months
to get over her,

19:41.520 --> 19:45.160
and now seeing her face here, my
fucking head is all over the place.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.080
Oh, fuck.

19:51.920 --> 19:55.600
I don't think you realise I was
in a fucking bad way when you left.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.120
I do realise now, that's why I've
came here...I was in a bad place

19:59.200 --> 20:01.360
I was a fucking shadow
of the person I am.

20:03.040 --> 20:07.120
It's just horrible seeing him hurt
still now after, like what,

20:07.200 --> 20:08.600
two years of being apart.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.240
I do wonder why you have come back.

20:11.320 --> 20:14.440
I just wanted to come here
and say sorry for what I did.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.120
But then it's just brought
so many feelings back,

20:17.200 --> 20:19.240
and I do feel like
you're still mine.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.640
Even though you're not.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.440
Feelings don't go away at all.
I thought they did,

20:23.520 --> 20:25.720
I thought I was
a lot stronger than I was.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.600
And now I just think,
"Fuck me, I've hurt him so much."

20:28.680 --> 20:31.080
It's just fucking hard.
It's really hard.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.760
Oh, God, I would never
wanna hurt you like I did.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.280
But obviously I did, so...

20:35.360 --> 20:37.960
Oh, God, it's just a mess.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.360
It always is a mess
with me and Aaron. Always.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.320
Where are you going?

20:47.360 --> 20:51.320
I can't fucking take it. My heart is
literally broken from that girl.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.800
Fucking hell.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.280
(sighs)

21:00.920 --> 21:03.160
Oh, fucking hell.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.760
'With Jack and Becca's kiss
still fresh on everyone's mind,

21:14.840 --> 21:19.840
Harriette decides now is the time
to put Ross out of his misery.'

21:19.920 --> 21:23.480
Harriette was a little bit annoyed
that Jack and Rebecca kissed.

21:23.560 --> 21:27.720
That's why she's finally gonna show
her Babestation moves on Ross' dick.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.520
There's no way Harriette is
leaving this penthouse

21:32.600 --> 21:34.840
without a good seeing to from me.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.120
Oh, babe, you deserve it so bad.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.600
Oh, fuck. Hard.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.760
You deserve everything
you're about to get.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.360
(moans)

21:52.960 --> 21:54.600
Oh, God.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.600
What happened with you and Aaron?

21:57.760 --> 21:59.560
He got stressed.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.920
I'm just so upset about Aaron,
cos I know I'm hurting him.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.680
I think it's really hard for him
that I'm here.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.800
He did get really upset.
I've never seen him cry before.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.440
I still am pissed off
about him and ZaraLena.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.960
So if I wanna get with Jack,
I'll get with Jack.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.480
'While Jack and Becca
cosy up for the night,

22:18.560 --> 22:20.960
Josh is keeping his distance
from Nicole.'

22:24.320 --> 22:26.920
I'm not gonna put myself on hold
just for Nicole.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.200
'But Adam still thinks he's
in with a chance.'

22:30.280 --> 22:34.320
I'm sleeping over here by myself.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.360
Adam is barking up the wrong tree.
Just fuck off. Leave us alone.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.040
How are you feeling about Becca?

22:44.120 --> 22:47.520
It's just weird.
Weird, weird situation, like.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.040
I've woke up this morning, and my
head is still all over the place.

23:22.120 --> 23:25.280
I'm lying next to Zara,
knowing that Becca's upstairs.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.320
Like, I wanna have fun with Jack,

23:30.400 --> 23:32.760
but then I wanna
sort things out with Aaron.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.480
I don't know, confused as fuck.

23:34.560 --> 23:39.120
As far as it goes with Becca,
I've got the green light, I think.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.760
There's no point in no-one
holding back. If you like someone,

23:42.840 --> 23:44.560
you might as well go and get it.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.840
Hello.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.960
The man of the moment.
So, did you, erm... pummel her?

23:55.040 --> 23:56.600
None of your business, mate.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.720
I've woke up feeling very happy
and a lot less frustrated.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.120
Did Ross shot his load in you?
(laughs)

24:02.200 --> 24:03.440
Shoot his nut?

24:03.520 --> 24:07.400
Normally, I would have made him wait
longer, but it just felt right.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.520
You look like you've
come to breakfast

24:09.600 --> 24:13.000
with your hat back to front like
a proper bad boy now.(laughter)

24:13.080 --> 24:17.080
I think Harriette was jealous
that Jack kissed Rebecca last night.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.600
So, I think that's why
Harriette fucked Ross.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.680
They've had plenty of chances
to go in the penthouse.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.240
And they done it then.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.400
Jack doesn't have ant influence
on how I act with Ross.

24:29.480 --> 24:33.880
It's just a bit of a weird feeling.
It's definitely not jealousy.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.960
I don't feel jealous at all.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.120
So, what happened with yous two,
then?

24:44.200 --> 24:46.440
Cos you had a chat, didn't you?
Not really.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.920
You ain't spoke?
No.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.520
Me and Becca started
a little chat last night,

24:50.600 --> 24:52.800
but it was too much for me
and I got upset.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.120
Hopefully, today,
we can have a nice chat

24:55.200 --> 24:57.320
and see where both our heads are at.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.760
'A nice chat will be the last thing
on everyone's mind

25:00.840 --> 25:04.240
when the next ex rocks up
on the beach.'

25:04.320 --> 25:06.720
'Whose ex is next?'

25:09.160 --> 25:12.400
'The Tablet of Terror has sent
the villa out on a fun train.'

25:12.480 --> 25:15.320
'Let's hope nobody leaves
their heart on the line.'

25:15.400 --> 25:17.360
This'll be fun. Choo-choo!

25:17.440 --> 25:19.840
Woo! Put your hands up
in the air, guys.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.280
Let's all go on the fun train!
Na, na, na, na!

25:22.360 --> 25:24.760
'Well, at least one person's
having fun.'

25:27.200 --> 25:29.160
It's very awkward.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.280
I'm sat with Aaron and Zara,
the new little lovebirds.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.760
How are you two feeling?
Cos I feel fucking really awkward.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.920
You're not in the fucking middle.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.680
Aaron and Becca need to
have this chat one-on-one.

25:40.760 --> 25:44.600
I'm sat there on this fucking train
feeling awkward as shit.

25:53.320 --> 25:57.120
It's getting very emotional cos I
just realise how much I've hurt him

25:57.200 --> 26:00.080
and hurt myself by just
fucking off to Australia.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.160
I see Becca start crying
and Aaron hug her.

26:08.240 --> 26:12.120
So Zara's sat there with that awkward
smile she does all day and night.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.280
The longer me and Aaron,
like, leave this conversation,

26:24.360 --> 26:28.320
the more and more I'm just getting
more jealous, more angry by the day.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.280
So, you kissed Becca last night,
didn't you? Yeah.

26:33.360 --> 26:37.160
I'm sat next to Jack and Harriette.
My chance to quiz Jack about Becca

26:37.240 --> 26:39.520
and see Harriette's reaction.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.440
Do you like her, then?
Yeah, mate, she's fit as fuck.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.520
Stayed with her, didn't you?
Yeah.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.840
Harriette's got a face
like a slapped arse

26:46.920 --> 26:50.400
I don't if she's jealous of Jack
moving on and getting with Becca,

26:50.480 --> 26:53.400
or if she's just in a bad mood.
It'd be good to go on a date,

26:53.480 --> 26:55.080
but her and Aaron need to talk.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.200
If he gave you the all clear,
would you crack on? Yeah.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.600
I'm not really worried about
the Aaron and Rebecca situation.

27:01.680 --> 27:05.840
There ain't no loyalties in here. If
I wanna crack on, I'm gonna do it.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.640
Oi, H, what about you?
What do you make of Becca?

27:08.720 --> 27:10.480
She's not really my cup of tea.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.560
No?
No.

27:11.640 --> 27:15.960
Why dig a bird out that ain't done
nothing? Bit of jealousy going on.

27:16.040 --> 27:20.080
If Jack thinks that I'm jealous of
the situation between him and Becca,

27:20.160 --> 27:22.760
then he is absolutely
fucking mental.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.120
Right, everyone, we're here.
I loved it.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.360
Have you two not sorted
anything out yet?

27:28.440 --> 27:31.160
It's hard to have a proper chat
in front of everyone.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.720
It just needs to be me and her,
so...

27:33.800 --> 27:35.280
(tablet chimes)

27:35.360 --> 27:37.520
(all groan)

27:37.600 --> 27:39.800
Ding, ding.
Fucking tablet's gone off.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.320
I hate hearing that thing.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.360
"Hello, everyone. It's date time."

27:43.440 --> 27:46.600
"Rebecca and Jack,
will it be no strings attached,

27:46.680 --> 27:49.280
or will emotions fly high?"
Fucking blinding.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.520
Time I spent a bit of time
with a fit bird.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.000
I'm glad it's not me.
You're gutted really.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.560
I'm glad it's not me.

27:55.640 --> 27:59.040
You two, take the wheel and go
on your date. Let's go, then.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.240
Laters.
See you later.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.600
Aaron is gutted. I know Aaron,
and I know he's not happy about it.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.000
To be honest with you, I don't
think Jack will crack on with her

28:09.080 --> 28:11.960
until yous have had your chat.
He did say that to us.

28:12.040 --> 28:15.640
If he does, he does. But I don't
think he's the type that would.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.360
Hopefully.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.880
Oh, what have you got me here.
A nice little kite?

28:25.960 --> 28:27.360
Is this my present, is it?

28:27.440 --> 28:29.880
The day was fucking awkward
on the train.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.760
Me and Aaron do have a lot
to talk about, but right now,

28:32.840 --> 28:36.640
it's amazing to get out the villa,
away from the whole situation.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.960
Come on, then, run.
It ain't working.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.960
Oh. (laughs)

28:42.040 --> 28:43.640
Two, three, go.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.560
Wait. Oi, I've got it.
You've got it.I've done it.

28:47.640 --> 28:48.760
(cheers) Teamwork.

28:48.840 --> 28:51.560
Don't fall off the cliff. (laughs)

28:51.640 --> 28:52.960
Yay!

28:53.040 --> 28:55.320
Even though you're shit.
Oh, well, aye.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.400
I came here to clear things up
with Aaron,

29:00.480 --> 29:04.280
but then I really didn't think Jack
would be this much of a distraction.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.320
If he said he liked you,
how would you feel about it?

29:07.400 --> 29:10.800
I don't think that's the problem.
He ain't got a leg to stand on.

29:10.880 --> 29:11.960
He's with ZaraLena.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.880
I just want her to forget
all the fucking Aaron shit.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.960
It's all a load of bollocks, really.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.520
I want her to let her hair down
and have a laugh.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.800
Let's forget about them, man.
So, what's your type, then?

29:22.880 --> 29:26.400
Well... bad boy. Obviously, tattoos.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.720
Tall, dark. You, basically.
(both laugh)

29:28.800 --> 29:32.400
I don't know if you're a bad boy..
I'm a good boy.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.320
This date's fucking bang on,
really.

29:37.400 --> 29:41.040
I've got the fittest bird in the
villa. I ain't got Aaron around me,

29:41.120 --> 29:44.920
no-one else putting their two pence
in. I wanna make a move really.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.080
How would you feel, like,
if I was to kiss ya?All right.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.400
It's perfect being here with Jack
tonight, he's fit as fuck.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.600
Might stick my tongue
down his throat.

29:53.680 --> 29:56.120
You'd feel all right about it?
Yeah.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.760
(laughs) What?

30:06.920 --> 30:10.080
Jack and Becks are on a date.
I'm not gonna let that bother us

30:10.160 --> 30:13.320
or spoil my night.
But everyone knows, especially me,

30:13.400 --> 30:16.360
that me and Becca need to chat.
(tablet chimes)

30:16.440 --> 30:18.440
(groans, laughter)

30:18.520 --> 30:22.600
What the fuck has this little
red thing got in fucking store?

30:24.560 --> 30:26.160
(laughs)

30:27.200 --> 30:29.560
Oh. My. God.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.000
This is fucking bad.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.480
"Good evening..." (laughs)
It's that bad, you're laughing.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.360
"I hope you're having as much fun

30:38.440 --> 30:40.800
as Becca and Jack are
on their date..."

30:40.880 --> 30:42.840
As I'm reading it, I see a picture.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.840
With a little picture.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.920
There's a picture of
Jack and Becca kissing.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.840
I see Aaron's face and it's dropped.
Looks like there's tongues.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.880
Why the fuck have you done that,
Tablet of Terror?

30:56.960 --> 30:59.640
I think that's cruel.
Don't make him see it.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.600
What the fuck, Jack?

31:04.080 --> 31:05.120
Nah, it's all good.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.720
If she's went on a date
and started necking on,

31:07.800 --> 31:09.840
I think it's a bit disrespectful
to me.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.560
Especially cos we haven't had
the chat we need.

31:12.640 --> 31:16.080
I'm trying to bite my tongue cos
I'm aware it can't be nice for him,

31:16.160 --> 31:18.280
but at the same time...
what about me?

31:18.360 --> 31:21.040
Yeah, and he told me he was
gonna have a chat with you

31:21.120 --> 31:23.960
and let you two speak together
before he'd crack on.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.120
Unfortunately, Jack is like that.

31:26.200 --> 31:29.680
Everybody's shocked that Jack
has necked on with Aaron's ex.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.360
I'm not fucking shocked,
that's what he's like.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.400
I don't think she deserves a chat.
She ain't getting one.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.800
She doesn't give a fuck about me.
If that's the case, fuck off.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.760
If she did really, really love you...

31:44.840 --> 31:47.160
Hello. You all right?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.880
Becca's walked in,
arm in arm with fucking Jack.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.880
And that is a kick in the balls.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.360
Why walk in rubbing it
in my fucking face?

31:55.440 --> 31:56.480
How did the date go?

31:56.560 --> 31:59.320
I had to fly a kite, mate,
with no wind or nothing.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.040
Is that just what you did, yeah?
Then we had drinks and this picnic.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.840
Sounds romantic.
It was all right, mate.

32:05.920 --> 32:09.120
So, if there's romance and a laugh,
was there a kiss?

32:09.200 --> 32:12.840
Yeah, we had a little kiss, yeah?
Was there tongues?

32:12.920 --> 32:14.600
Maybe a little bit.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.120
She was fucking smiling.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.560
She knows she's hurt us and
she's looking across the table

32:19.640 --> 32:23.360
fucking smiling at us. That, to me,
is a fucking evil little person.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.840
You can fuck off.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.160
Did you only kiss once?
What?

32:27.240 --> 32:30.520
Did you only kiss once?
No, a couple of times.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.760
I look at Aaron's face
and he's genuinely upset.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.080
And I feel absolutely gutted
for him.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.680
Because I do really believe
that he loved her.

32:38.760 --> 32:42.000
It was banter though, like.
It was fucking... banter, man.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.720
He's never come to me
and said to me, straight up,

32:44.800 --> 32:48.000
"I've still got feelings for her,
don't do anything."

32:48.080 --> 32:51.560
We were in a situation yesterday,
on a date, and we didn't neck on.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.320
I still asked, right, for the chat.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.600
We've been trying,
and you won't fucking speak to me.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.440
I was fucking crying my eyes out.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.640
You just walked off
in a little fucking huff.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.000
He never tells me
his proper feelings.

33:06.080 --> 33:09.000
I'm always there
playing fucking guessing games.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.640
You can crack on with Jack.
Don't talk to me.

33:11.720 --> 33:15.120
That chat that we banged on about
since she walked in the house

33:15.200 --> 33:18.040
will not happen.
You're still seeing fucking Zara.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.040
What the fuck?
Why did you come here?

33:20.120 --> 33:23.600
To fucking see you and try and
make amends and smooth things over!

33:23.680 --> 33:27.240
But you're too busy fucking around
with her to give me five minutes.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.400
She stuck the knife in yesterday.
She's just twisted it.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.920
If you had respect,
you wouldn't kiss Jack.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.800
If you had respect, you'd have said,
"Look, Bec, I'm seeing Zara."

33:36.880 --> 33:38.880
I'm not seeing her.
You fucking are.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.840
This is how our relationship was.
We fucking argued all the time.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.360
you can see she's hurt. You can
see you're hurt. Go and talk.

33:46.440 --> 33:50.320
How can I have a conversation with
someone in front of an audience?

33:50.400 --> 33:53.400
I don't want to.We didn't
have an audience last night,

33:53.480 --> 33:56.080
yet you still fucking
wouldn't speak to me.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.800
I was fucking crying,
you fucking dickhead!

33:58.880 --> 34:00.360
Fucking dick.

34:00.440 --> 34:03.560
You're a fucking wind-up
little fucking... Fuck off.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.960
Stupid little bastard.

34:05.040 --> 34:09.199
(sobs)
Like I say, we just fucking...

34:09.280 --> 34:13.080
go on as if we hate each other,
when really, I don't think we do.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.480
He's in love with you, mate.
He's not. He's really not.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.120
He hates me.
No, he loves you.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.600
Aaron and Rebecca
clearly love each other.

34:28.679 --> 34:31.360
But too much has happened
for them to be together.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.199
You've gotta think,
he's waiting here patiently

34:34.280 --> 34:38.960
for you to get back to have a talk.
They sent a picture on that tablet.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.520
It's the way that you was laying.
He was here, and I swear to God,

34:42.600 --> 34:44.639
you was like this on him.
No!

34:44.719 --> 34:48.040
If I would have seen that, that
would've split my heart and all.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.679
I'm not here to hurt Aaron at all,
I'm really not.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.960
All I've wanted to do
is speak to him.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.800
I feel bad now.

34:57.240 --> 35:01.160
'If you think things are bad now,
they're gonna get a whole lot worse

35:01.240 --> 35:03.560
when the next ex
washes up on the beach.'

35:03.640 --> 35:06.080
'T minus 12 hours.'

35:11.280 --> 35:13.440
Could you not see
how much Aaron like her?

35:13.520 --> 35:15.200
What are you talking about?

35:15.280 --> 35:18.280
You're fucked off because
people have seen the real you.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.480
Don't take it out on me.
Jack and Harriette have a row.

35:21.560 --> 35:24.000
She's obviously still
got feelings for him.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.840
Don't come at me with your shit
cos you've fucked someone over.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.040
You've just gone on a date with
a bird, why is it you need to

35:31.120 --> 35:33.600
come back and still give me shit?
Fuck off.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.920
I don't even wanna row with you.
I don't care about you enough.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.680
Stop giving me shit.I don't know
why Harriette keeps arguing with me.

35:40.760 --> 35:44.800
I've let her do what she wants.
I don't give a fuck, never have.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.440
Full of shit!

35:46.520 --> 35:48.560
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

35:48.640 --> 35:49.640
I'm going now.

35:51.320 --> 35:52.600
Done, mate.

35:55.680 --> 35:59.640
The fact that Jack and Harriette
keep arguing is pissing me off.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.160
You argue with him
every single fucking day.

36:02.240 --> 36:06.360
He argues with me every day...
You just go and argue then.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.160
It's nothing to do with
mine and Jack's feelings.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.600
It's Jack trying to
make me look a dickhead.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.560
It's embarrassing.
I don't argue with people.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
I can't be arsed with this bullshit.

36:16.720 --> 36:20.360
You still have to argue back.
I can't let somebody mug me off.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.520
Someone says that to you...
I can't deal with that.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.040
That's cool, you go. That's it.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.880
As far as I'm concerned,
Bec can do what the fuck she wants.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.200
She's a nasty little person
and I will do what the fuck I want

36:43.280 --> 36:45.000
from this night forward.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.680
I'm fuming with Harriette.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.880
I can't be arsed speaking to her,
don't wanna stay with her.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.800
Until she figures out where she's at,
I'm out of here.

37:10.920 --> 37:13.440
I can't understand
why Ross can't see

37:13.520 --> 37:15.760
that I'm trying to
stand up for myself.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.280
I can't do this,
have you arguing with your ex.

37:19.360 --> 37:24.240
You sound a bit insecure, babe.
You're making me feel like that.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.640
I'm making... My actions are
making you feel insecure?Yeah.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.280
Because you keep wanting to
argue with your ex.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.400
The whole situation with Harriette
is just like deja vu.

37:33.480 --> 37:36.200
I feel like I need to put
an end to it. He was nothing.

37:36.280 --> 37:39.600
Why do you care what he says?
I'm gonna stand my fucking ground!

37:39.680 --> 37:42.760
It's who I am!If you want to
speak to me like that, fuck off.

37:42.840 --> 37:46.480
Listen, I've told you how I feel,
I don't argue with people. Walk off.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.280
I don't wanna be with you.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.640
'With her relationship with Ross
in tatters,

37:58.720 --> 38:01.560
Harriette is left to sleep solo.'

38:03.000 --> 38:04.960
'But not for long.'

38:05.040 --> 38:07.080
Are you fucking serious?

38:08.720 --> 38:12.080
'Nothing else to do but wake up
the rest of the villa.'

38:12.160 --> 38:13.320
I'm asleep, yeah?

38:13.400 --> 38:16.440
I'm asleep, and she comes in
and sleeps in the fucking bed,

38:16.520 --> 38:19.360
Jack come up and gets in bed
with her. Am I a dickhead?

38:19.440 --> 38:23.680
I fucking hate the geezer.
I can't stand fucking Becca.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.000
Try and get some sleep, lass.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.600
She can fucking stay away from me
in this place,

38:28.680 --> 38:31.200
or I'll rip her fucking face off.
I swear down.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.840
Honestly, you don't know who I am.
I am a nutcase.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.480
I'm keeping myself
on a fucking level here.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.720
I could have ripped
the cunt's face off.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.440
I have no feelings for Jack at all.
