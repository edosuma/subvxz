10:28.200 --> 10:30.520
You don't know?

10:30.640 --> 10:32.320
No.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.040
They come in the night,
or early in the morning.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.480
They stop people on the streets.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.960
Looking for overstayers?

10:39.080 --> 10:41.840
Pulling people from theirbeds, scaring the ladies--

10:41.960 --> 10:43.280
the little children?

10:43.400 --> 10:45.560
Well, if they don't likeit, they should go home.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.000
It is their homes thecops are taking them from.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.040
They live here.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
They have jobs here.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.240
Other people's jobs.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.440
Who's jobs?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.880
New Zealanders'--
people from here.

10:55.000 --> 10:55.920
Where are you from, then?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.480
Here, but I was
born in Belfast.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.120
Oh, did your mother do
it with a black fellow?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.920
[snickers]

11:03.040 --> 11:03.840
How dare you.

11:03.960 --> 11:04.760
He's brown, isn't he?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.320
I'm Black Irish is all.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.480
And I'm not from some islandin the middle of nowhere.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.640
This island joined to Britain?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.080
No.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.480
It's the British Isles,and we have a connection,

11:12.600 --> 11:13.680
and we speak English.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.160
- I speak English.
- But you're brown.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.400
So you're not from here.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.000
- What about him?
- That's different.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.280
He's a married, not a bullah.- That is racist.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
Well, it's what
you're called--

11:22.520 --> 11:23.760
darkie, coconut, bullah.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.360
All right, all right.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.000
All right, we're going tocalm it down right about now.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.800
Our friend here might bea coconut, but none of us

11:28.920 --> 11:29.680
love the pigs.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.040
I'm into that.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.520
It's our doing a job on
these cops up the wazoo.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.000
Come now, boy, and
let's get you home.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.880
Thank you for your fine foodand your kind hospitality.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.600
No worries.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.400
All right.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.760
Hello, love.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.280
We'll get out of your
hair so you can tidy up.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.200
All right, see you later.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.480
Yeah, thanks, Lefty.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.920
Thanks for breakfast.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.240
How'd it go?

11:52.360 --> 11:53.520
It was a bit of trouble.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.640
Well, now there'll
be more trouble you.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.200
You mark my words.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.160
Rita's been stirring again.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.600
They say islanders
are taking all the jobs.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.520
But my people take the
jobs no one wanted.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.920
Yeah, but there aren't so manyjobs anymore, any sort of jobs.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.320
And is that our fault?

12:10.440 --> 12:13.160
Probably not,
now you mention it.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.120
[knocks]

12:14.240 --> 12:15.280
Hello?

12:15.400 --> 12:16.200
Anyone home?

12:19.080 --> 12:21.240
My place has been robbed.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.040
The floor mats, the TV!

12:24.160 --> 12:26.840
My cassette player!

12:26.960 --> 12:30.000
It'll be the Tongans.
- How do you know?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.960
They steal anything
that's not nailed down.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.720
[inaudible]

12:34.840 --> 12:36.520
Right-o.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.840
It's not the first time.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.960
Every time a Samoan
family gets taken away,

12:40.080 --> 12:40.920
they clean the place out.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.800
What are you doing?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.720
I will wreak vengeance onthe Tongans down the road

12:48.840 --> 12:49.840
and find my cassette player.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.720
Maybe not such a good plan.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.440
The Bible says
an eye for an eye.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.960
You don't want to get
picked up by the cops.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.280
And I've got locks
to change in Swanson.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.160
Locks?

12:58.280 --> 13:00.720
Yeah, it's my job.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.240
Look, have you got anyoneelse you could stay with?

13:03.360 --> 13:05.880
All my family is taken away.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.800
Except apart from
my second cousin,

13:07.920 --> 13:11.160
who stays in [inaudible] andmy uncle on my mother's side.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.080
But he stays down
in [inaudible]..

13:15.200 --> 13:16.000
It's very cold down there.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.800
I have been faithful to himall the years of our marriage.

13:21.920 --> 13:22.960
And I'm not a slut.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.640
I'm just friendly.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.360
Funny, I've been able
to have children.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.200
You're so lucky
to have this one.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.040
You're going to be a realheartbreaker one day,

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
aren't you, Wolfie?

13:31.280 --> 13:32.040
Hmm-hmm.

13:32.160 --> 13:32.960
Hello?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.040
Hello.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.640
Carol's come to stay over.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.760
This is Falani.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.480
Said he could keep
down for a bit.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.360
Good afternoon, ladies.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.040
This is my son, Wolf.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.280
My wife, Mrs. West.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.320
And Phineas's wife,
Mrs. O'Driscoll.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.680
Phineas the racist?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.440
He's married to an angel.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.160
[laughs] That is the
look I was going for.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.880
RITA WEST: Excuse
us for a minute.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.160
I thought you were
doing a job, not

13:57.280 --> 13:58.560
picking up waifs and strays.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.200
Yeah, there was a
bit of a hitch in that.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.680
He's got nowhere else to go.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.560
Jesus, Ted.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.800
You're such a softy.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.040
Me?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.720
What the hell was
going on with Carol?

14:07.840 --> 14:09.320
She just needs
a bit of time out.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.960
You don't get between
a man and his wife.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.400
[car approaches]

14:14.520 --> 14:17.320
[tires screech]

14:20.640 --> 14:22.080
Lefty says you
got my wife here.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.720
I do, as a matter of fact.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.960
Carol!

14:26.080 --> 14:27.640
Carol, get your
bloody ass out here!

14:27.760 --> 14:29.760
Hey, mate, why don't you comeinside, have a chat about it?

14:29.880 --> 14:30.640
Carol!

14:34.760 --> 14:36.120
Get in the car.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.000
No.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.160
Get in the bloody car.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.080
I'm not going to,
and you can't make me.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.440
We'll see about that.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.920
I'm not coming home.

14:46.040 --> 14:46.880
What?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.360
I'm leaving you, you idiot.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.680
And I never want
to see you again.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.320
So there.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.200
You walk out on me, and youwon't see another bloody penny!

14:53.320 --> 14:54.760
I don't see a
bloody penny anyway,

14:54.880 --> 14:56.560
and I pay for the groceries.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.040
You're a tight bastard who onlycares about his stupid mamie.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.640
[ANGRILY] Don't you
talk about my mamie!

15:00.760 --> 15:03.320
Bugger her and her bloodyrosary, and her stupid saints.

15:09.040 --> 15:09.840
Inside now.

15:09.960 --> 15:10.720
I was making a stand.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.160
Inside now.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.600
Come on, Phineas.Let's take it somewhere else.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.480
Hey, hey, hey!

15:14.600 --> 15:15.720
Come on.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.960
Come on, let's go
somewhere else, OK?

15:20.200 --> 15:21.600
It's your bloody wife
putting ideas in her.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.120
Carol can think for herself.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.560
Sometimes.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.040
Surely you two
can work this out.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.320
No, she's done.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.520
She's done [inaudible].

15:28.640 --> 15:30.640
Maybe if your mom went home.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.480
PHINEAS O'DRISCOLL: What areyou saying about my mamie?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.480
Nothing.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.920
Nothing at all.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.240
So when are we
going to do this job?

15:37.360 --> 15:39.400
It's just Talita
wants another day.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.400
Talita?

15:40.520 --> 15:41.760
She's a babe.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.360
Yeah, well, you're
welcome to her.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.000
How could that happen
when she's keen on you?

15:46.120 --> 15:48.480
We can't have another crackat the job until next Thursday.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.000
Why?

15:50.120 --> 15:51.200
Because that's the daythey bring the payroll, Bert.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.120
Hey, that's right.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.800
[inaudible]

15:53.920 --> 15:55.120
You don't want to do that.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.880
We were married
in the sight of God.

15:57.000 --> 15:57.800
She can't walk out on me.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.040
Give her some space.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.240
Don't tell me what to do.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.240
You and your wife actingall high and bloody mighty.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.480
Well, you can bloody--
- Come on, mate.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.440
Nah.

16:05.560 --> 16:06.760
You can stick the lot of it.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.720
While she's at your
bloody house, I'm out.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.560
Out of what?

16:10.680 --> 16:12.480
The game.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.800
I've had it.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.360
[breathing heavily]
I've had it up to here!

16:17.480 --> 16:20.000
Just what we needed.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.440
[grunts and groans]

16:24.520 --> 16:27.320
[disco music plays]

16:27.440 --> 16:29.320
[laughs]

16:29.440 --> 16:30.240
Woo!

16:30.360 --> 16:31.120
Ow!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.160
Shake that booty!

16:32.280 --> 16:33.160
Woo-oo!

16:33.280 --> 16:34.600
Come on, Wolfie, don't be shy.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.480
I'm not dancing the disco.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.440
Aw.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.400
Music for your soul, man.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.360
Hi, Ted.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.840
How are ya?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.320
Been better.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.720
Falani's showing Carolhow to do the Samoan hustle.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.960
Is he now?

16:48.080 --> 16:50.320
I haven't had this
much fun in years.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.760
OK.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.600
might be time to
wrap up this party.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.320
Your room's down
the end of the hall.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.880
Your bed's made up.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.280
Bless you, Mrs. West, forinviting me into your home,

16:59.400 --> 17:02.080
for your lovely food, andpity for the homeless.

17:02.200 --> 17:02.960
My pleasure.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.080
Whoops.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.960
Ooh, lean on me,
Mrs. O'Driscoll.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.240
Call me Carol.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.600
Lean on me, Mrs. Carol.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.560
CAROL O'DRISCOLL: [laughs]

17:09.680 --> 17:11.400
[laughs]

17:11.520 --> 17:13.040
That guy is weird.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.000
RITA WEST: He has very nicemanners, and he did the dishes.

17:16.120 --> 17:16.920
Disco sucks.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.000
How long's Carol
going to be staying?

17:22.120 --> 17:23.840
As long as she wants to be.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.240
Phineas says he's quittingthe gang on account of it.

17:26.360 --> 17:28.040
Oh, how terrible.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.120
It's not great, Rita.

17:29.240 --> 17:32.520
I really don't want to argue.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.400
How long is that boy
going to be staying?

17:34.520 --> 17:35.920
Thought you didn't
want to argue.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.880
You know how I feel aboutmen who beat up on women.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.680
Yeah, and I'm not a fan ofMuldoon and his bully boys.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.160
Well, we both
have our principles,

17:44.280 --> 17:48.240
and that makes us
quits, doesn't it?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.000
Where are you going
to on this fine day?

17:50.120 --> 17:51.480
School.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.240
Ah, I don't do school.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.800
I do my living on the streetsand the university of life.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.600
Like disco dancing?

17:58.720 --> 18:00.680
I also know martial arts--

18:00.800 --> 18:01.920
how to please the lady.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.080
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.080
And I can see into the future.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.080
Eh, I bet you $2
that in 10 minutes,

18:09.200 --> 18:10.760
I'll be driving a
kickass [inaudible]..

18:10.880 --> 18:11.640
Bullshit.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.440
[engine starts]

18:22.600 --> 18:23.400
$2.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.040
You got something for me, Ted?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.280
I want to report a crime.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.840
No, coming from
you, that is funny.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.080
It's the [inaudible].

18:35.200 --> 18:39.160
Now your lot are busting intohouses looking for overstayers.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.520
[inaudible] we're
not, thank, Christ.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.480
You're still a copper.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.520
And you know other coppers.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.240
What about it?

18:44.360 --> 18:45.880
Poor bastards
in South Auckland

18:46.000 --> 18:47.480
have the cops taking them way.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.400
Then buggers are coming inand stealing all their stuff.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.560
Tragedy.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.720
But what do you care?

18:52.840 --> 18:53.840
Young friend of
my acquaintance

18:53.960 --> 18:55.000
told me what was going on.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.640
Well, maybe he
should call the police.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.720
Then he'll get taken away.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.080
Look, I'm not a fan ofthese bloody raids any more

19:02.200 --> 19:03.520
than you are.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.760
It's Muldoon going totake the heat off himself.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.040
I don't love the
coconuts, but it's not

19:07.160 --> 19:08.480
like they buggered the economy.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.720
What the hell do youexpect me to do about it?

19:10.840 --> 19:12.920
Well, your mates in
South Auckland-- tell

19:13.040 --> 19:15.320
them to do their bloody job.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.760
That's the address of thehouse that got cleaned out.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.960
This is very community
minded of you, Ted.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.600
There's a line
between right and wrong.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.320
And speaking of lines, howdid you come to be down the line

19:26.440 --> 19:27.680
in South Auckland?

19:27.800 --> 19:28.600
Just passing through.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.480
We were going fishing.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.040
Sure, you were.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.560
It's a free country.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.960
Or it's meant to be.

19:35.080 --> 19:35.920
If you say so, Ted.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.160
- Hello, [inaudible].
- No.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
I have an appointment.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.400
I'm very sorry.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.120
But I am in no
fit state to work.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.400
Hmm.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.160
Yes, Lefty tells me
you've left Phineas.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.160
Yes.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.840
He's very upset, apparently.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.920
Passed out drunk
is what Ted told me.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.360
It's hard for men.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.240
They don't know how todeal with their feelings.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.320
You want me to
feel sorry for him?

20:02.440 --> 20:03.760
He's saying he'll
leave the gang.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.000
You want me to
get back with him

20:05.120 --> 20:06.320
because of the precious gang?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.640
I just think you
need to be practical.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.440
You know there's this
new law coming in.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.480
What law?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.160
The matrimonial
property thingy.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.160
If you wait a couple of months,then you can take him for all

20:15.280 --> 20:17.320
he's got, or half of it.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.120
I don't care.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.400
But it's not fair.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.880
In all these years,
and you get nothing.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.280
But I don't get nothing.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.720
I have my insurance.

20:26.840 --> 20:30.520
You mean the krugerrands?

20:30.640 --> 20:31.800
Sure.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.160
That was for when
our men weren't around.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.840
CAROL O'DRISCOLL: But I
don't have a man around.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.800
I'm going to buy myself acar, get some new clothes.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.320
Maybe I'll even take [inaudible]out on a date in my new car

20:41.440 --> 20:43.560
wearing my new clothes.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.960
Phineas can suck on that.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.080
See you at home.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.040
I'll get something for tea.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.120
That will be a worry.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.400
We have a bigger problemthan a burnt bloody dinner.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.400
Maybe.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.320
Forget maybe.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.800
You heard what she said.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.640
Carol's never been discreetat the best of times.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.000
She's all talk.

21:04.120 --> 21:07.080
If she starts shooting
her mouse off, fooling

21:07.200 --> 21:10.760
around the krugerrands, you knowyou and I are in serious shit.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.680
How was school?

21:16.800 --> 21:17.560
All right.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.440
What did you get, Falani?

21:19.560 --> 21:21.320
I had a quiet day--

21:21.440 --> 21:24.680
thinking of my family,
feeling sad for them.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.720
[tires squealing]

21:28.440 --> 21:29.080
Woo-hoo!

21:34.640 --> 21:36.480
If you wanted to callthem, that would be fine.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.080
Alas, they have
no phone in Samoa.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.080
Hello, everyone.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.160
I got the tea.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.480
Fried chicken-- this
is manna from heaven.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.720
I've been thinking
about cooking.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.000
And bugger it.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.760
From now on, I'm going
to buy everything.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.400
I like this plan.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.920
It's going to be takeawaysevery night, or I'm going out.

21:54.040 --> 21:54.960
Sounds expensive.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.840
I'm a woman of means.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.320
And this woman needs to party.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.760
Woman of means?

22:02.880 --> 22:03.960
What's she on about?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.480
She's got her sell on.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.960
If Phineas goes
out on his own,

22:07.080 --> 22:08.520
it could be bad for all of us.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.440
You know what he's likeafter he's had a few drinks.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.880
It's not a reason forhim to get back with Carol.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.560
And I've made up
my mind on this.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.520
[knocking]

22:17.640 --> 22:18.640
I don't want to [inaudible].

22:18.760 --> 22:20.120
But what?

22:20.240 --> 22:21.960
Only Carol's showing Falanihow to play strip poker.

22:22.080 --> 22:22.880
Who's winning?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.200
Falani.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.520
He's on his [inaudible].

22:30.600 --> 22:32.480
[disco music plays]

22:32.600 --> 22:35.560
You know, my
husband is a robber.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.160
You're kidding.

22:37.280 --> 22:42.280
They all rob all sorts ofthings-- jewelry stores, TAB.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.120
Falani, Carol's
a little bit drunk.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.280
Oh, no.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.400
That's terrible.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.880
And you should
really get to bed.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.360
OK.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.320
Good night.

22:51.440 --> 22:57.600
[inaudible]

22:57.720 --> 22:59.480
[turns music off]

22:59.600 --> 23:01.040
What the hell do you
think you're playing at?

23:01.160 --> 23:02.560
I was just having a
bit of fun, that's all.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.880
You know the rules.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.360
We don't talk about
what our husbands do.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.400
But he's not my
husband anymore.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.560
And leaving him was the
best thing I ever did.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.680
[music plays]

23:14.800 --> 23:16.920
VOCALISTS [SINGING]: And I'lltake you home on a bright

23:17.040 --> 23:23.800
and sunny morning We dancedall night until pale moonlight

23:23.920 --> 23:36.600
And now the day is dawning

23:36.720 --> 23:38.600
I think it might be a
good idea if Carol gets

23:38.720 --> 23:41.160
back together with Phineas.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.680
Thought you'd
made up your mind.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.440
I just wanted her to
stop being a doormat

23:44.560 --> 23:46.040
so Phineas would get
his act together.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.320
Well, you know
that's not very likely.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.880
Well, now, it's
fucking essential.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.200
And I need your help on this.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.880
Hey, Mrs. West.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.320
And Mrs. Carol.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.880
Hi.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.120
Oh, he's such a sweetie.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.200
Adorable.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.640
But we are off to work.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.680
See you, boys.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.000
Hey, Ted.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.480
Did you, by any chance,
hear from the police

24:17.600 --> 24:18.840
about the robbers?

24:18.960 --> 24:19.760
No, afraid not.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.600
I'll spot you later.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.480
[QUIETLY] Hey.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.800
Is your father
really a bank robber?

24:26.920 --> 24:27.800
Safe cracker.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.400
Cool.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.680
He's like Superman with
this double identity.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.840
Good day, Ted.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.000
Could I talk to you aboutyour mates down the line?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.280
About what?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.240
The robberies.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.520
I made inquiries.

24:41.640 --> 24:42.840
But the homeowners
had made a complaint.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.840
How could they when
they've been deported?

24:44.960 --> 24:46.760
It's not my job to
save the world, Ted.

24:46.880 --> 24:47.680
I'll leave that to you.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.920
What did he want?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.440
Wanted to know what wewere doing in South Auckland

25:01.560 --> 25:03.640
in the middle of the night.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.440
I told him it wasn't
the middle of the night.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.600
It was closer to the morning.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.800
Was that a wrong thing to say?

25:10.920 --> 25:11.720
No, no.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.080
It's good, Phineas.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.400
If he asks again,
just tell him we were

25:14.520 --> 25:16.880
passing through, going fishing.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.040
Yeah, that would've been good.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.240
How are you going?

25:22.360 --> 25:25.840
Well, it's a bit tough.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.480
Carol used to bring
in the housekeeping.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.320
She'd go on at me about
not pulling my weight.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.880
Look, we do that payroll joband we're right back on track.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.400
And you know, Carol--

25:36.520 --> 25:38.480
she misses you.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.840
She said she never
wanted to see me again.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.680
She was up all nightcrying something terrible.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.600
Ah, she drives me crazythe way she goes on at me.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.120
Maybe we're better off apart.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.960
Women-- they're
not the same as us.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.760
Half the time, they're
awash with hormones.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.960
It's no wonder they speak awhole lot of crazy rubbish.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.360
There's that effect.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.440
You got to make
allowances for them--

26:01.560 --> 26:03.360
treat them kind.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.640
It's a lot like
dealing with horses.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.480
[inaudible].

26:09.600 --> 26:11.640
But Mamie's offered
to stay on and cook.

26:11.760 --> 26:12.680
Is that what you want?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.840
At your age?

26:15.960 --> 26:17.440
I'll tell you what.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.280
Shout your mum a trip to seeyour sister in [inaudible]..

26:20.400 --> 26:21.720
Come over to the
house and see Carol

26:21.840 --> 26:23.560
and tell her how you feel.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.080
That she drives me crazy?

26:26.200 --> 26:27.240
But in a good way.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.400
Nice wheels.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.440
That yours?

26:41.560 --> 26:42.320
Don't think so.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.320
Phineas, nice to see you.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.200
You too.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.600
Hi.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.680
Where'd you get that from?- Nowhere.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.800
Where'd you get it?

27:02.920 --> 27:04.360
We'll pick this up later.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.880
Is Carol here?
- Yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:06.840
She's probably in her room.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.040
She's down here.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.360
[clears throat]

27:11.480 --> 27:12.320
[moaning]

27:12.440 --> 27:13.240
See?

27:13.360 --> 27:15.280
I told you she was upset.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.440
Maybe she's unwell.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.360
[moaning]

27:17.480 --> 27:18.520
[knocks]

27:18.640 --> 27:19.680
Carol, Phineas
is here to see you.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.160
Carol, love, I've
got a few things--

27:21.280 --> 27:23.040
CAROL O'DRISCOLL: [screams][inaudible],, get out!

27:23.160 --> 27:24.160
Get out!

27:24.280 --> 27:25.280
Carol!

27:25.400 --> 27:27.560
Son of a bitch,
I'll replace this!

27:27.680 --> 27:30.040
No!

27:30.160 --> 27:31.040
Phineas.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.040
No, mate.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.000
You-- you want a brown cock?

27:33.120 --> 27:34.280
Piss off!

27:34.400 --> 27:35.720
- Who else have you slept with?- No one.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.640
Come on, mate.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.640
Honestly, Carol, how
is this helping anyone?

27:41.760 --> 27:43.600
I got my first
decent root in years!

27:43.720 --> 27:45.280
For fuck's sake,
put some clothes on.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.160
I'm real sorry, mate.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.480
You started it.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.040
If you hadn't picked
up that brown bastard

27:53.160 --> 27:53.920
in the first place--

27:54.040 --> 27:55.120
OK, it's not the best.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.600
And I will deal with it.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.440
And my loyalty is
still with you.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.440
As if--

27:59.560 --> 28:00.760
We're still doing the job.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.840
And Carol has
overstepped the mark.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.960
She has.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.120
And she won't be staying--

28:05.240 --> 28:06.080
not anymore.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.640
Thanks for this, love.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.160
Yeah, no worries.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.440
And, uh, you just yell ifyou need anything, kid.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.320
All right?

28:19.400 --> 28:21.200
I don't think
this is very fair.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.400
What's not fair?

28:22.520 --> 28:24.400
Kicking me out,
taking Phineas's side.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.600
You let Falani stay.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.200
He's practically
a fucking orphan.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.520
And you went and rooted him.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.960
He rooted me, actually.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.080
He's a teenager.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.840
He's hung like a donkey.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.640
And you told me to take a stand.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.160
Not flat on your back!

28:37.280 --> 28:38.320
You're a grown woman, Carol.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.720
You need to sort your shit out.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.600
I have-- like you told me.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.160
You got backhanded.
Big deal.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.480
You said it was wrong.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.280
Some people get broken
arms, cracked ribs.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.480
They lose a fucking spleen.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.400
That happen to you?

28:54.520 --> 28:57.880
[sighs] No.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.640
He only ever broke my wrist.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.520
Ted did?

29:00.640 --> 29:03.120
My dad.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.480
Did the rest to my mother.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.400
Oh, shit, babe.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.720
I didn't know.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.040
What have you done
with your krugerrands?

29:08.160 --> 29:09.320
What's that got
to do with anything?

29:09.440 --> 29:11.880
The krugerrands--
how you got them--

29:12.000 --> 29:13.560
if that ever gets
out, it would screw

29:13.680 --> 29:15.520
everything between me and Ted.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.160
I would never tell.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.800
Not ever.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.880
But if I'm going to get a newlife, then I need to sell them.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.440
And that is my right.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.880
I'm very sorry formaking trouble and fooling

29:28.000 --> 29:29.640
around with Mrs. Carol.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.120
But she's the most beautifulwoman I've ever been with.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.240
You've had others?

29:34.360 --> 29:37.400
Heaps-- in the
pages of Playboy.

29:37.520 --> 29:41.880
Well, babies on paper area whole lot less trouble.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.360
Now, where did all
this crap come from?

29:44.480 --> 29:45.800
South Aukland.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.360
We went to see some Tongans.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.040
Is this the stuff they
took from your house?

29:49.160 --> 29:50.400
Not exactly.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.400
But they probably sold
it, because they'd

29:52.520 --> 29:54.040
sell their grandmothers.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.120
What's the story withthe car parked out front?

29:56.240 --> 29:59.080
It's a bit dinged becausethe tomans be bad drivers.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.440
But, uh, it's my gift
to you and Mrs. West.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.200
All right.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.760
You two need to listen
up and learn some rules.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.200
I bow to the wisdom of
the master safe cracker.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.000
Where did you hear that from?

30:12.120 --> 30:13.520
First rule.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.680
You don't leave stolen
goods parked out front

30:15.800 --> 30:16.960
or wherever a cop can see them.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.160
Far out and solid.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.080
He's the man.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.240
Second rule.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.840
You don't steal
from your own kind.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.040
They're not my kind.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.040
They're Tongans.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.640
You don't steal for revenge.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.360
That's just dirty pool.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.200
There are two sorts of
people in this world--

30:30.320 --> 30:32.480
the rich and the poor.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.200
Now you can rob from
the rich all you like,

30:34.320 --> 30:35.360
because they deserve it.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.200
But you never steal
from the poor.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.800
You got it?

30:38.920 --> 30:41.640
You want us to give
all the stuff back?

30:41.760 --> 30:43.720
Well, now, that would justbe plain fucking stupid.

30:47.760 --> 30:53.320
Yeah, it's a nice,clean job on the hot wire.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.880
This boy's got potential.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.880
Send that over to your
family, help them out.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
That's my other rule.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.240
Think of others,
don't get greedy.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.280
You are like Jesus,
as well as Superman.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.560
Maybe seeing the similarity.

31:08.680 --> 31:12.200
But if you want to find outwho these toreg thieves are--

31:12.320 --> 31:14.480
We should leave
it to the cops.

31:14.600 --> 31:15.480
Bugger that for a joke.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.320
You are truly a great manto help strangers in need,

31:22.440 --> 31:24.000
solving crime.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.920
You are like Starsky and Hutch,as well as Jesus and Superman.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.280
Do you ever
bloody stop talking?

31:31.800 --> 31:32.680
Here we go.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.600
Why don't you get out thereand fight their racist asses?

31:43.720 --> 31:45.560
That would just
get us arrested.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.240
The cops-- they're fascists.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.800
True.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.560
Why did you check
in the mirror?

31:51.680 --> 31:52.440
Force of habit.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.200
Here we go.

32:12.040 --> 32:12.960
Holy crap, Batman.

32:13.080 --> 32:13.960
Who is it?

32:14.080 --> 32:15.360
That's the son of a minister.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.960
He's a Tongan.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.240
Yeah.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.520
How would he know about this?

32:19.640 --> 32:21.440
The people.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.400
They call the minister
when there's a problem.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.040
That bastard.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.560
Now, can I do some vengeance?

32:26.680 --> 32:27.440
Go for your life, son.

32:38.480 --> 32:41.360
[pounds on window]

32:42.480 --> 32:45.320
[dog barks]

32:46.680 --> 32:48.800
Mike, what brings
you to these parts?

32:48.920 --> 32:51.800
Just wondering what bringsyou to these parts again.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.880
Just looking out for the youngfriend that I told you about.

32:54.000 --> 32:54.800
[kung fu cries]

32:54.920 --> 32:56.040
Good to know.

32:56.160 --> 32:59.960
Yeah, there he is
now with the robber.

33:00.080 --> 33:00.880
Good to know.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.640
[screams]

33:05.760 --> 33:07.920
Well, your mate's
quite fast, isn't he?

33:08.040 --> 33:09.520
For a big fella.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.480
Thought you weren't interestedin what happens down here.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.760
Oh, I'm alwaysinterested, kid, especially

33:13.880 --> 33:14.920
where you're concerned.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.160
Oh, Rita, what a great place.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.520
And you have some
lovely jewelry too.

33:24.640 --> 33:25.640
Don't you think?

33:25.760 --> 33:26.560
Yeah.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.040
Nice.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.360
Well, I'd stay and browse,but we'll make a date

33:29.480 --> 33:31.560
for another time, won't we?

33:35.960 --> 33:36.800
Bye, handsome.

33:36.920 --> 33:37.720
Bye.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.680
See ya.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.400
See ya.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.960
Oh, Christ.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.560
Rita, I don't know how muchlonger I can put her off.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.960
Can't you just string heralong 'til after the job?

33:47.080 --> 33:49.000
She'll be slighted when sherealizes I took advantage.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.040
You could flick her some cash.

33:50.160 --> 33:50.960
You heard.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.480
What she wants is a ring.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.080
So get her one.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.400
Wedding ring.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.920
- Oh, that's tricky.
- Yeah.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.040
You're telling me.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.560
And then she's
got four brothers.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.800
And one of them's a Reisler.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.680
Oh.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.800
[laughter]

34:03.920 --> 34:04.680
- You poor bastard.
- Oh my God.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.600
Is that--

34:05.720 --> 34:07.520
A lot of bad handwriting.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.520
No, it's a McCann.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.960
They're what?

34:10.080 --> 34:11.480
Colum McCann, the artist.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.680
He's famous.

34:13.800 --> 34:14.920
You mean that
these ugly things

34:15.040 --> 34:16.080
are actually worth something?

34:16.200 --> 34:16.960
Well, Christ, yes.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.200
And you have two.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.040
Could you find a
way to offload them?

34:20.160 --> 34:21.480
Happy to, sweetheart.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.400
Lawless.

34:22.520 --> 34:23.280
Hi.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.800
Good news.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.960
I can give your mate somecash for those paintings.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.880
Shall we say, um, $50 for each?

34:30.000 --> 34:30.880
Yeah.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.160
She'll be thrilled.
- Great.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.080
Cheerio.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.040
See ya.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.560
See ya.

34:35.680 --> 34:36.880
Thank you.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.400
Hey, now, um, that
friend that you

34:39.520 --> 34:40.600
wanted me to keep an eye on.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.680
How is Carol?

34:41.800 --> 34:43.480
Well, she's been partying.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.320
She's had the old
man over as well.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.760
And the other night a couple ofvisitors, the Nolan brothers.

34:48.880 --> 34:49.640
[sigh]

34:49.760 --> 34:50.720
Not those idiots.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.080
I know.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.440
Oh, and when I wascleaning up the next day,

34:54.560 --> 34:56.160
I found something.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.840
Couldn't spend that downthe dairy though could you?

34:58.960 --> 34:59.760
No.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.360
Some foreign rubbish.

35:01.480 --> 35:02.240
Yeah.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.800
That's what I thought.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.440
There's a bit of
a hitch in the plan.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.400
Which is that a certain copperseems to be keeping an eye

35:08.520 --> 35:10.120
on me whenever I'm in Idaho.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.560
How did McCarthy
get on to that?

35:12.680 --> 35:14.440
The point is, we
know it, so now we

35:14.560 --> 35:15.800
work out how to deal with it.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.080
Sooner we get this job
over with, the better.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.680
And how is Talita?

35:20.800 --> 35:23.240
She's coming over;
couldn't put her off.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.760
Greetings to you all.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.040
And the house of cool.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.040
Hey, man.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.400
I stole from the rich;
the minister's son.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.480
That's the ticket.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.200
I also stole the
minister's car.

35:34.320 --> 35:37.520
God may curse me but, I parkedit the back at Bella's place.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.560
I don't see anything goodabout that, little shit.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.320
Settle.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.600
Hey, how is everyone?

35:43.720 --> 35:44.840
Great.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.280
A bit pissed off,
now you mention it.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.160
Settle.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.320
Falani?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.360
Talita.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.080
What are you doing here?

36:02.200 --> 36:03.640
Visiting my friends.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.640
You know your mother hasbeen worried sick about you.

36:05.760 --> 36:08.320
In Samoa?

36:08.440 --> 36:09.960
She's not in bloody Samoa.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.160
She's in Papatoetoe.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.320
So you're not homeless.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.520
Not completely.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.040
And your family
haven't been deported.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.440
They're New Zealand citizens.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.320
[sigh]

36:23.440 --> 36:24.760
What were you doing
in that house in Idaho

36:24.880 --> 36:26.040
in the first place?

36:26.160 --> 36:28.240
I was visiting my
mate when the cops came.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.760
Then I got to come hereto beautiful west Oakland

36:31.880 --> 36:35.760
and your wonderful housewith beautiful Mrs. Carol;

36:35.880 --> 36:38.440
all the food and so much space.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.600
Eh?

36:39.720 --> 36:41.120
I have nine
brothers and sisters.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.560
It's so crowded.
