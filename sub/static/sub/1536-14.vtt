00:01.080 --> 00:02.160
Previously on
Grimm...

00:02.240 --> 00:05.642
You now have access
to a primal force of nature.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.285
This is what I am now, forever?

00:07.400 --> 00:09.687
There's nothing anyone can
do to change that, Juliette.

00:09.880 --> 00:10.927
I want you out!

00:15.440 --> 00:16.646
Bring it on, bitch!

00:22.640 --> 00:23.721
You almost killed Adalind?

00:24.040 --> 00:25.485
There's something
I have to show you.

00:31.360 --> 00:36.890
"No one is so thoroughly
superstitious as the godless man."

00:42.280 --> 00:44.720
You're not Juliette, you're Adalind.
What did you do with her?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.489
Nick, it's me.
I don't believe you.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.162
Listen, you proposed to me on this
couch, you had a ring, I said no.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.245
You hid it upstairs in the dresser drawer.
I found it.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.520
Adalind would never know that.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.810
How did this happen?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.802
I don't know.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.681
I didn't know what was
happening at first.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.969
I was really nauseous,
I thought I was pregnant.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.130
I had headaches.
And then it just happened.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.931
And it's been happening
more and more.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.328
It's how I killed
the guy from the Tribunal...

01:28.760 --> 01:30.046
...and the Manticore...

01:34.400 --> 01:36.607
...and how I almost
just killed Adalind.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.726
Why didn't you tell me?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.850
Because I was scared.

01:44.520 --> 01:48.844
Look, we're going
to figure this out

01:50.040 --> 01:51.166
and get rid of it.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.206
We can't.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.280
Why not?

01:56.440 --> 01:57.521
It's permanent.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.366
You don't know that.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.249
I do. Henrietta told me.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.647
Who's Henrietta?

02:03.720 --> 02:06.405
The Hexenbiest who's been
helping me figure this out.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.169
You've been seeing a Hexenbiest?

02:08.240 --> 02:09.924
I had to,
I didn't wanna hurt you.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.403
Well, how did you
find Henrietta?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.405
Sean Renard.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.484
You told him before you told me?

02:18.600 --> 02:20.602
I needed help, Nick.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.371
His mom's a Hexenbiest,
he's half Zauberbiest...

02:23.440 --> 02:24.566
You should have told me.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.440
I was afraid
you were gonna kill me...

02:33.400 --> 02:35.562
Juliette,
I would never hurt you.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.451
Never

02:46.160 --> 02:47.924
This is all because of me.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.489
This is because
I became a Grimm again.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.649
We took a chance, you know.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.088
We knew that there might be side
effects, it's what we wanted.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.651
Juliette, I'm so sorry.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.443
Nick, where are you going?

03:10.960 --> 03:12.450
I don't know.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.525
You're dripping
water everywhere!

03:17.600 --> 03:18.601
Just take it, Chloe.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.886
Come on, you two.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.325
Oh, Peter, please,
don't make a mess.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.209
I'm not, she's...

03:23.280 --> 03:25.328
I just really think
I need to go to bed.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.364
This early?
You feeling all right?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.046
I'm fried.
Coach killed us today.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.521
I'm running the 800,
and the 1,500.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.041
Okay. Go rest. I don't
want you getting sick.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.322
I won't. Good night, Mom. Night.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.486
So, what's your homework
situation like?

03:44.080 --> 03:45.320
Terrible.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.165
I have a paper due in English,
an entire page of algebra,

03:48.240 --> 03:50.811
and a biology test I haven't
even started studying for.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.491
Go. I'll finish up.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.648
Thanks, Mom.
You're welcome.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.481
Tired?

04:09.120 --> 04:10.201
Really?

04:10.920 --> 04:12.200
Don't be such a loser.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.850
Kayla's having a party
tomorrow night.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.166
And you're not going.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.406
Okay,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.360
guess I'm gonna go tell Morn
you're having trouble sleeping.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.603
I'm sure she'll bring you
some warm milk.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.727
All right, fine. Fine.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.040
I'll cover for you tomorrow,

04:26.720 --> 04:28.280
but you gotta get back
at a decent hour.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.681
Deal.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.205
Catch you on the flip.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.085
Are you crazy?

05:00.160 --> 05:01.321
What took you so long?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.607
I had to make a deal with Chloe
so she wouldn't tell my mom.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.045
Your mom needs to lighten up.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.720
She's just paranoid something's
going to happen to us, that's all.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.085
Well, she's right,
something is gonna happen.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.201
Mmm.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.929
I brought us a blanket, and a pretty
candle to get you in the mood.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.689
What was that?
Nothing.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.771
Relax.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.605
I think somebody's out there.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.770
It's probably my mom
looking for me.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.450
What? Now?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.125
I need to go.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.287
Go.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.805
Hey, hey, hey.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.205
I love you.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.045
Now, text me as soon
as you're home, okay?

06:26.120 --> 06:27.281
Okay.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.366
Hello, lad.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.725
Oh, my God!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.286
No...

07:39.880 --> 07:41.041
No, no, no.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.485
No!

07:44.960 --> 07:47.088
Peter? No!

07:51.880 --> 07:54.884
Mom? Stay inside, lock
the door behind me.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.321
Peter!

08:01.000 --> 08:02.161
Peter!

08:04.200 --> 08:05.406
Peter!

08:06.320 --> 08:08.129
Oh! No! Peter!

08:08.280 --> 08:09.566
Peter!

08:12.160 --> 08:14.731
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.243
Peter. Help me! Help me!

08:18.800 --> 08:20.450
Help me!

08:20.800 --> 08:22.484
Help me!
Somebody help me!

08:44.120 --> 08:47.044
Nick, please, stop, okay?
You're really scaring me.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.520
I don't want to scare you, I
just want you to know the truth.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.286
I love you so much.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.807
Who are you?

09:03.560 --> 09:04.846
You need to be a Grimm again.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.006
Hank.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.121
Where?

09:47.480 --> 09:49.323
Hope you had time
to grab some dinner.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.848
Nope. I'm DVR-ing the
fourth quarter of the game,

09:51.920 --> 09:54.844
so if you hear a score,
I don't want to know.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.001
You all right?

09:56.080 --> 09:57.127
Yeah.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.446
Hey.
Where's the body?

09:58.520 --> 09:59.646
Right this way.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.882
Seventeen-year-old kid,
Peter Bennett.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.724
Snuck out to meet
his girlfriend,

10:03.840 --> 10:05.604
ended up getting
his foot cut off.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.045
What?
Yeah.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.765
Mother heard
the screams, ran out,

10:09.840 --> 10:11.763
found him unconscious,
tried to save him.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.565
Kid was dead by the time the
paramedics finally got here.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.843
Think he bled out,
no other sign of trauma.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.161
Blood was contained to the
area around the body.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.129
Whose shotgun?
Mom's.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.805
Had it with her when she
ran out to find her son.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.923
Where's the foot?
Still looking.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.924
The killer take
the foot with him?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.246
Hell of a foot fetish.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.528
Who called 911?
His mom.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.162
- Let's talk to her.
- Yeah.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.888
There was so much blood.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.168
- I couldn't stop it.
-  I tried.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.851
Has anyone ever
threatened Peter?

10:40.680 --> 10:41.680
No.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.881
How long have you lived here?

10:43.600 --> 10:44.931
Just a few months.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.086
You like your neighbors?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.204
They're good people.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.085
They would never hurt Peter.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.690
Any other family?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.490
Peter's father?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.120
My husband,

10:58.400 --> 10:59.765
uh,

10:59.880 --> 11:02.008
he was killed in a car
accident about a year ago.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.531
And that's why we moved
from Seattle.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.608
I wanted to give
my children a new start.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.720
He told me he was going
up to bed.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.644
We're gonna do everything we
can to find whoever did this.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.764
I'm sorry. Um...

11:24.520 --> 11:25.646
ls there anything else?

11:25.760 --> 11:28.525
My daughter is back at the house,
and she's lost her brother.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.920
So I'd really like
to be with her.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.249
That's all.
Thank you.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.251
She's Wesen.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.291
Is this it?

11:52.480 --> 11:53.720
Must be.

12:15.720 --> 12:16.926
Hello?

12:23.760 --> 12:24.761
Did you bring it?

12:25.200 --> 12:26.725
Of course.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.681
Throw it here.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.570
It's all there.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.407
We've been trying for so long...

13:03.280 --> 13:04.611
You're sure this will work?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.124
Always does.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.005
Thank you, thank you.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.082
I love you.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.162
I love you, too.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.802
Let's start a family.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.682
I'm not gonna kill you.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.447
I got home late. I
didn't want to wake you.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.523
Yeah, I'm sure it had nothing
to do with me being...

14:14.600 --> 14:16.125
I wanna talk to Henrietta.

14:16.640 --> 14:17.641
I'll call her.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.324
No, I want to talk
to her face to face.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.085
I should go with you.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.169
I think it'd be best
if I went alone.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.961
Okay.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.930
I'll let her know you're coming.
This is the address.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.886
You should really memorize it,
it can be a little bit tricky.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.885
It's not me, I didn't do that.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.731
Juliette, I'm gonna make
this right.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.211
And I love you.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.324
I'll see you later.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.002
So, you're Nicholas Burkhardt.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.008
I've heard a lot about you.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.006
Come in.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.844
You told Juliette what
happened to her is permanent?

15:37.040 --> 15:38.849
And you've come
to prove me wrong.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.128
It's not what she wants.
I can't help that.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.483
I thought I could at first,
but not now.

15:44.960 --> 15:49.010
The blood of a Grimm
can destroy a Hexenbiest,

15:49.640 --> 15:51.005
I've done it before
with Adalind.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.730
And I can do
the same for Juliette.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.845
You can't.
Your blood is in Adalind,

15:55.920 --> 15:58.605
and because of what
she did to Juliette,

15:59.400 --> 16:01.846
the blood of a Grimm
can't save her now.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.760
Then I'll find
someone else to help her.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.008
There's only one way
to stop your Hexenbiest.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.401
Kill her.

16:10.280 --> 16:13.762
Or accept her for who she is.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.288
Just like she accepted you
being a Grimm.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.724
And while she's discovering
what she's capable of,

16:22.480 --> 16:25.802
I would suggest
you keep a safe distance.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.242
What's that supposed to mean?

16:43.240 --> 16:45.925
You walked in here doubting me,

16:46.760 --> 16:48.250
and now look at you.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.368
See how easy that was?

16:58.840 --> 17:02.322
And I'm not nearly as skilled
as Juliette will become.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.849
Beware, Mr. Grimm.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.050
So this guy just moved
to Portland.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.891
Before that, he was living
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.489
Somebody forget
to set their alarm?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.290
Not in the mood, Wu.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.441
Sorry.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.529
We got anything?
Similar case.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.040
The body was found in the
woods, foot chopped off.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.484
Three years ago in Lane County.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.768
Victim was
a 23-year-old male.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.882
Only lead was a young boy
on his bike,

17:31.960 --> 17:33.689
who saw a big guy in a long coat

17:33.760 --> 17:36.240
walking through the woods
with, and I quote,

17:36.320 --> 17:38.004
"A really big-ass ax."

17:38.080 --> 17:40.560
There was an all-out manhunt,
but the case went cold.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.325
I'm thinkin' serial killer.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.250
I'm thinkin'
serial foot collector.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.288
Yeah, but why the foot?

17:46.360 --> 17:47.521
I mean, if it's Wesen...

17:48.360 --> 17:50.283
Is it?
The Mom is.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.885
What kind?

17:55.080 --> 17:56.241
I'm not sure.

17:56.320 --> 17:59.881
But, um, she looked
a little rabbit-like.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.003
So Peter must be
a rabbit-like Wesen, too.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.651
Okay, wait.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.281
Peter is a rabbit-like Wesen
and somebody cut off his foot?

18:09.200 --> 18:12.044
Anybody else thinking
lucky rabbit's foot?

18:13.680 --> 18:15.011
Let's go.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.682
I don't think
this will ever get old.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.130
I could spend days in here.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.326
We have.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.601
Found it

18:24.680 --> 18:26.762
It's called a Willahara.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.968
It's written in some
kind of old English.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.364
Dates back to 1217.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.650
That's Middle Ages.
Here.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.281
Uh, "Willahara were
considered sacred..."

18:40.160 --> 18:41.207
Here we go.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.921
"Due to the fecund
nature of this Wesen,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.002
"it is believed that good
fortune and fertility

18:46.080 --> 18:47.730
"is bestowed upon
newlywed couples

18:47.800 --> 18:52.124
"who participate in a practice
known as Spedigberendess."

18:52.400 --> 18:53.561
What is that?

18:53.680 --> 18:57.401
It says here, "Before
relations are to begin,

18:57.680 --> 19:00.126
"the severed Willahara
foot must be placed

19:00.240 --> 19:02.607
"beneath the couple
wishing to procreate."

19:03.560 --> 19:04.641
You're joking.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.767
Okay, not joking.
There's more.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.166
"The fresher the foot, the
more fertile the female will be.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.962
"Within three days,
conception will occur."

19:18.320 --> 19:21.005
They leave a severed foot
under the bed for three days?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.200
That's what this says.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.810
Uh, does anybody else
think that's messed up?

19:23.920 --> 19:26.201
Uh, here's something about
the Wesen that hunt them.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.128
They're called Leporem Venators.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.770
There's something
to be proud of.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.362
If these Willahara are still being
hunted by the Leporem Venators,

19:35.800 --> 19:39.964
then maybe the car accident that Peter's
father died in wasn't an accident.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.481
See what you can find out.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.641
I'll hop right on it.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.244
I tried to stop myself
before I said it, sorry.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.971
This is happening in Portland?

19:49.320 --> 19:51.368
Well, if it has anything
to do with Wesen fertility,

19:51.440 --> 19:53.647
I'll bet you Monroe and Rosalee
know something about it.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.926
We need to talk.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.123
Do we? Viktor is obsessed
with finding our child.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.890
He knows you're looking, too.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.201
That's an expensive coat.
Viktor buy that for you?

20:27.520 --> 20:30.126
Listen to me. Viktor's gonna have
you killed as soon as he finds her.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.247
Uh-huh.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.802
Our little girl has been through
so much in her short life,

20:35.160 --> 20:37.367
and all without the two
people who love her most.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.605
She needs us.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.126
Now more than ever.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.362
Are we the two people
who love her the most?

20:43.640 --> 20:46.371
Don't mock me. I'm taking a
huge risk coming to you.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.120
Come on, Adalind,
why are you really here?

20:49.560 --> 20:52.769
When Viktor finds Diana,
and he will find her,

20:53.720 --> 20:55.688
he is not gonna need me
anymore either.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.930
It's going to get ugly.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.688
I mean, Viktor, the Resistance,
Nick and his Hexenbiest...

21:04.320 --> 21:05.606
So you know about Juliette.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.123
Caught me a little off guard.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.568
When did you find out?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.965
She didn't know
where else to turn.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.042
Well, isn't that sweet.
What'd you tell her?

21:17.200 --> 21:18.400
Nothing much I could tell her.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.247
Oh, you sent her
to Henrietta, didn't you?

21:24.920 --> 21:26.968
Well, that explains a lot.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.121
If this happened to Juliette,

21:30.200 --> 21:33.044
that means someone helped
Nick become a Grimm again.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.925
So it's true.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.525
Why don't you ask him?

21:38.200 --> 21:39.565
I don't think so.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.841
You and I need to be
on the same side.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.529
It's us against them,

21:46.600 --> 21:49.649
and I'll do whatever it
takes to save our daughter.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.288
I want you with me.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.367
Damn, you're good.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.649
I really do want to believe you.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.761
For once, you should.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.600
Willahara.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.171
Yeah, I've heard of them.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.161
Never seen one, though.

22:16.240 --> 22:19.767
My grandfather swears he found one
hiding in the Bavarian Forest.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.207
He didn't cut off... Oh, no, no, no.
He already had kids.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.731
He did eat 'em, though.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.527
But that's beside the point.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.680
From what I've heard, Willahara
don't stay in one place too long.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.211
It's the same reason
they don't want to Woge

22:31.280 --> 22:33.520
in front of other Wesen, you know.
Fear of being exposed.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.202
The thought that they're still being
hunted? Don't get me started.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.520
If the killer
is selling their feet...

22:38.600 --> 22:40.125
That is, I'm sorry, outrageous.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.047
God, you're getting me started.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.964
Sorry, uh, but, um,
who are they selling to?

22:45.200 --> 22:46.247
Couples trying to get pregnant.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.721
I mean, why else would you want a
Willahara foot under your bed.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.887
It's not exactly romantic.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.247
How does the Leporem Venator
find these couples?

22:52.720 --> 22:54.563
There's gotta be a middle man.

22:54.720 --> 22:55.801
Fertility clinics.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.924
Wesen fertility clinics.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.081
There is such a thing?

22:59.160 --> 23:00.924
There's Wesen fertility
doctors in every big city.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.048
Although, what we're talking
about is illegal,

23:03.120 --> 23:04.485
they are not going
to be advertising,

23:04.560 --> 23:07.609
"Come on in for the Spedigberendess
severed foot option."

23:07.720 --> 23:10.041
But a Wesen couple could
speak with these doctors

23:10.120 --> 23:11.610
without raising any suspicion.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.888
Are you guys volunteering?
Hell, yes.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.883
If we can help put a stop
to this savagery, we're in.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.327
See? That's what
happens when you get her started.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.848
Wu, what did you find out?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.522
I'm putting you on speaker.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.723
Peter's father was killed
in a hit and run accident.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.650
Driver never apprehended,
left foot severed off.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.371
Not found at the scene.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.800
Left foot?
Does that matter?

23:32.840 --> 23:34.205
Supposed to be the lucky one.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.760
I just went out there to
follow up on the accident report.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.487
They're gone.
Nothing left in the house.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.210
They're running scared.
We need to find them.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.327
We're coming in.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.200
We'll speak with
the Wesen fertility doctors.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.165
It's just for one night.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.007
I got us a flight
to Calgary in the morning.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.690
We're just going
to leave Peter here?

24:00.520 --> 24:02.204
No funeral? Nothing?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.200
We have to keep moving, honey.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.123
I'm sick of moving!

24:07.080 --> 24:08.684
I know you are...

24:09.360 --> 24:10.566
I know.

24:11.560 --> 24:12.846
Come on.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.884
We're low on cash.
There's an ATM in the lobby.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.440
I'll get us something to eat
while I'm out there.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.966
I'm not hungry.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.320
You will be later.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.960
I'll be right back.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.411
When did she do that?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.442
Did she leave
a forwarding address?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.525
Okay, thanks.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.291
Final arrangements for Peter
Bennett were made this morning,

25:41.440 --> 25:44.125
mother paid in cash,
left no forwarding address.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.080
The body is to be cremated.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.449
She's not coming back.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.201
Monroe.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.449
So, it looks like there's three Wesen
fertility doctors in Portland.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.521
I know one of them.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.045
I've been delivering
morning sickness remedies

25:58.160 --> 25:59.685
to him for years now,
I trust him.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.880
There's no way he's involved.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.126
The second one is a woman doc,

26:02.200 --> 26:04.202
but it looks like
she retired a month ago.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.760
So... That leaves us with a Dr.
Redfield.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.760
Monroe and I have
his last appointment today.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.804
Give me an address.
I'll meet you there.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.680
Nick, we can't just walk
into this guy's office with a Grimm.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.451
If there's even a hint that this
guy's involved, we'll call you.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.840
Okay.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.281
Chloe?

26:36.360 --> 26:39.523
Chloe! Chloe!

26:40.080 --> 26:41.366
Chloe!

26:42.000 --> 26:44.002
Chloe, Chloe!

26:46.520 --> 26:47.560
I'll see you next weekend.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.126
Did you know that by week 16 your
baby is only the size of an avocado,

26:50.200 --> 26:51.690
but it can hear?

26:52.480 --> 26:55.927
It says you're supposed to,
like, talk and sing to it.

26:57.360 --> 27:01.365
I think I'd probably play my
cello, my singing might scare it.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.081
What?

27:06.520 --> 27:08.568
You'd make a great father.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.485
You think?
I do.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.170
Monroe and Rosalee?

27:15.560 --> 27:17.403
I'm Dr. Redfield.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.841
Oh.
Right, sorry.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.970
Thank you. Come in.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.087
So, you've been
trying for some time.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.242
Yeah.
Several months now.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.006
Any, uh, history of infertility
in either of your families?

27:42.400 --> 27:43.890
Not that we're aware of.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.521
We've done
all the tests,

27:45.640 --> 27:47.563
we've been to the other
fertility clinics...

27:47.640 --> 27:49.130
We've tried everything.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.568
Well, I can see that you're
both in good health,

27:52.800 --> 27:54.245
and your age isn't a factor.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.529
I need to look
at your previous tests.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.931
Well, that's kind of
the problem.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.243
Nobody has been able to
figure out what's wrong.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.160
We were hoping there's
something you can do.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.929
I'm sure, once I look
at the tests...

28:05.120 --> 28:07.930
Something a little
less conventional.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.211
Something a little
more Wesen specific.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.762
I'm not sure I follow.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.969
We heard something you
could put under the bed?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.602
Everyone swears it works.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.208
If you're referring
to what I think you are,

28:26.400 --> 28:29.131
that is an appalling practice
I have nothing to do with.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.401
Now...

28:36.040 --> 28:37.371
If you'll excuse me.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.688
- You have to find her. Please. Please!
-  She's all I have left!

28:49.760 --> 28:52.411
I know what's going on.
I know you're a Willahara.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.921
No, no, no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.161
We don't have time for this.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.526
I'm a Grimm and we need to find

28:57.600 --> 28:59.080
the Leporem Venator
who's hunting you.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.567
Oh, my God, you do know.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.961
I'm relieved
he's not involved. Yeah.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.690
Well, unfortunately, that
doesn't help Nick any...

29:11.760 --> 29:13.091
Excuse me.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.122
I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.520
I may be able to help.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.766
Well, the doctor said there
was nothing he could do.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.401
I know what you're looking for.
But it's expensive.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.686
How expensive?

29:27.080 --> 29:28.844
$10,000. Cash.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.681
Uh...

29:31.920 --> 29:33.331
No problem.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.567
How soon can we do it?

29:34.800 --> 29:36.564
I believe there's one
couple ahead of you.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.280
I'll put you on the waiting list, and...
We'll pay more.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.691
We will? 15,000. We want
it as soon as possible.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.725
Let me see what I can do.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.160
It's me.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.291
I have a nice couple here who's
very anxious to get things started.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.889
They're willing to pay 15,000.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.246
Uh-huh.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.520
They'd like to know
how soon you'd be ready.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.285
Fifteen grand?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.887
Tell them I'll have
a nice fresh cut tonight.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.329
You're in luck.
He can do it tonight.

30:12.080 --> 30:15.004
I have your cell number. My contact
will text you when and where.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.085
Be sure to bring the money.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.087
That's it?

30:19.440 --> 30:20.771
That's it.

30:24.360 --> 30:25.850
Call Nick.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.041
I don't know who he is,

30:39.120 --> 30:41.088
I don't know anything about him
except he's hunting us down.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.491
Have you ever seen him?
No.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.324
How do you know it's the same
man that killed your husband?

30:44.400 --> 30:46.801
He's the Leporem Venator.
All Willahara know.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.086
How did he find you?

30:48.440 --> 30:51.091
My job, the kids' school.
You don't know.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.205
We stayed here too long.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.328
You'll stay under police
protection until we find this guy.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.805
But how are you going to do that?

30:57.880 --> 30:59.006
You... You can't find him.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.686
Hey, Monroe.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.131
It's going down tonight.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.521
What's going down?

31:05.600 --> 31:08.729
It's not the doctor, it's the nurse.
She just made the deal.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.211
She gave my number
to her "contact,"

31:10.280 --> 31:11.770
who's going to text
us when and where.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.445
Where are you now?
We're at the clinic.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.886
Twenty-Third
and West Burnside.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.200
Don't let the nurse leave.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.762
The victim's sister
was just taken.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.769
We're on our way to you.
Okay.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.447
Oh. No, no, no. Nick says
don't let her leave.

31:23.560 --> 31:24.891
Excuse me!

31:25.120 --> 31:26.690
We just had
a few more questions.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.285
I was very clear.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.845
Wait for the text.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.043
We were just wondering
if you could tell us...

31:33.320 --> 31:34.401
Yeah. Uh...

31:34.680 --> 31:37.411
You know, where the
feet come from.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.362
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.245
Wait, I need to know something.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.560
What?

31:44.760 --> 31:46.569
How much of that
blood money do you get?

31:49.160 --> 31:50.969
Oh, no, you don't.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.006
Damn.

32:10.520 --> 32:14.081
Come on now, my little love.
Let's get you inside.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.601
Hey.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.161
So the, uh, "Don't let
her leave" thing...

32:22.240 --> 32:24.242
It got a little tricky.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.566
We got this.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.210
Who's your contact?

32:35.760 --> 32:37.728
Give us a name.
We need to find him.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.564
I don't know his name.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.960
I swear, I've only met him once.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.200
Where does he meet the couples?

32:42.240 --> 32:45.244
I don't know, I have nothing
to do with that.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.885
He calls me when he's in town.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.201
You find the buyers.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.842
I'm helping couples
that have given up hope.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.246
Is that how
you justify it?

32:52.800 --> 32:54.040
It's accessory to murder.

32:55.520 --> 32:56.851
I'm not involved in murder.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.325
Nobody ever is.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.370
Ran the nurse's phone. Her
contact is using a burner.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.644
He's going to text us tonight with
the where and when, if that...

33:04.720 --> 33:06.927
Chloe will be dead by then.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.243
Wait a minute, who was the last
couple you set him up with?

33:11.560 --> 33:13.085
The Spinellis.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.404
They're patients here. Dr.
Redfield couldn't help them.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.406
Give us an address.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.284
Just a second, I'm coming!

33:22.040 --> 33:23.201
Police.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.360
Where's the Willahara foot?

33:24.400 --> 33:26.681
I have no idea what you're talking about!
Don't lie to me!

33:29.520 --> 33:31.443
Oh, my God!
I'm not here as a cop.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.843
What's going on here?
Sally!

33:34.000 --> 33:35.445
He's a Grimm!

33:40.280 --> 33:42.169
Wait, please, don't...

33:47.960 --> 33:50.406
Find it?
No.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.124
Where'd you meet the guy
who sold you that?

33:58.240 --> 34:02.484
A cabin in the woods, off Highway
22, a mile north of Post Road.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.160
I can't arrest you for this,

34:04.200 --> 34:06.487
but good luck when the Wesen
Council finds out about it.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.924
No, please, don't say anything!
All I wanted was a baby!

34:10.080 --> 34:11.366
Please...

34:37.239 --> 34:39.527
Stop your struggling, love.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.681
It won't do you
no good, you know.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.967
You're better off relaxing.

34:50.840 --> 34:54.003
There's a nice foot
you got there, love.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.650
It's good luck.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.764
Just, not for you.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.811
Now, be a good girl
and Woge for me.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.287
I asked you to Woge.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.885
We'll have to do
this the hard way.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.406
Nick...

36:37.760 --> 36:39.330
Not a sound, love.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.610
No, Hank! Hank!

37:59.200 --> 38:00.326
He's got Chloe!

38:14.720 --> 38:15.881
That's for my brother.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.202
This is for my father!

38:27.520 --> 38:28.720
Well, this is for...

38:38.640 --> 38:40.642
How about we go find your mom?

38:43.920 --> 38:45.001
Where is my mom?

38:45.080 --> 38:47.128
She's safe.
She's with officers now.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.450
Juliette?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.002
I talked to Henrietta.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.322
I'm not giving up.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.764
We're gonna get through this.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.604
You can't change it.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.089
I'm not going to let it
destroy what we have.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.723
I see the way
you're looking at me.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.527
Juliette...
It's not the same.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.044
It'll never be the same.

39:26.440 --> 39:30.126
You learned to understand me, now I
have to learn how to understand you.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.962
Is that forever?

39:43.280 --> 39:45.328
I'm not going anywhere.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.324
Is this what you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.724
Is it?
Why are you doing this?

39:56.160 --> 39:57.400
If I'm the girl of your dreams,

39:57.440 --> 40:00.284
the least you can do is kiss me.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.365
Kiss me.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.287
You can't even look at me.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.642
This is what's forever.

40:40.680 --> 40:41.966
Adalind.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.640
I hope you don't mind me
just showing up.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.840
I heard
you were back in town.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.291
I bet you did.

40:53.480 --> 40:58.168
So, I understand a mutual
friend came by to see you.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.411
Juliette. Lovely girl.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.924
Not so much anymore.

41:05.720 --> 41:06.721
Oh.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.041
What?

41:10.720 --> 41:12.085
Congratulations.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.008
For what?
Figuring out it was you?

41:16.400 --> 41:17.731
You don't know, do you?

41:17.880 --> 41:20.611
I know Sean Renard
sent Juliette to you.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.167
And I want to know how
she got so good so fast.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.401
What did you teach her?

41:26.160 --> 41:29.004
Oh, my, you really don't know.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.090
Definitely.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.964
Definitely what?

41:38.320 --> 41:41.767
You are going to have
another baby.

41:41.920 --> 41:44.400
That's impossible, I
haven't been with anyone.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.522
Well, you must have
been with someone.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.447
You didn't do this by yourself.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.925
No...

42:09.560 --> 42:10.925
No...

42:11.120 --> 42:14.806
No, no, no!
