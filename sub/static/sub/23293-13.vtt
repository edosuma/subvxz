WEBVTT

00:15.760 --> 00:18.400
SUNDAY
11:40 PM

00:20.160 --> 00:21.520
"Why didn’t you call me, huh?"

00:21.640 --> 00:22.520
Why?

00:22.640 --> 00:23.840
"Where the heck were you?"

00:24.200 --> 00:25.400
Where the heck?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.800
62 HOURS OF ROBBERY

00:28.560 --> 00:31.440
Wounded man! Wounded man! Help me!

00:32.560 --> 00:33.440
"What happened?"

00:34.320 --> 00:35.400
Helsinki, what happened?

00:35.560 --> 00:36.640
Hostages, escape.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.160
Strong whack, brain injury.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.640
Denver, did you know about the escape?

00:43.400 --> 00:45.720
Which hostage did the escape?

00:48.360 --> 00:49.840
Which hostage did the escape?

00:50.480 --> 00:52.480
Arturo. He told me, but I...

00:53.040 --> 00:54.480
didn’t get there in time.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.680
Arturo.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.320
Helsinki.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.680
Helsinki.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.480
Oslo is not well.

01:14.920 --> 01:15.800
No.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.520
He’s badly injured.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.120
No, no.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.120
Not badly injured.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.000
Not badly injured.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.480
He just needs rest and medicine.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.360
Time for medicine.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.680
-Why has he got his eyes opened?
-I, now give medicine.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.520
Anti-inflammatories

01:35.120 --> 01:36.000
and heparin.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.480
And go to sleep.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.840
And tomorrow, Oslo better.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.600
Moscow, you don’t worry.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.360
Oslo and I have had
worst colds than this one.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.080
Worst colds.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.360
"Oslo’s eyes never twinkled,

03:21.920 --> 03:25.800
but now it was how we looked all of us,
sad and absent.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.840
Hope is like dominoes,

03:28.920 --> 03:31.120
once one falls, the others follow.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.040
And the hostages noticed we were fucked."

03:37.360 --> 03:39.120
Last night we heard the shots.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.320
Anyone injured?

03:50.400 --> 03:51.480
I won’t shut my mouth.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.440
-Sit down.
-One of my pupils is missing,

04:01.600 --> 04:04.000
Pablo Ruiz,
and I want to know where he is.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.560
Sit down.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.840
I said sit down!

04:12.840 --> 04:14.760
Your pupil escaped
with a group of hostages.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.640
They blew up a charge and fled.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.400
You don’t have to worry about anyone.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.720
They’re all fine.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.720
What’s that freak doing?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.240
Madam, sit down
and stop clapping your hands.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.520
Sit down.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.520
Sit down, now!

04:57.520 --> 04:58.920
Madam, sit down.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.680
To the ground.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.960
To the ground!

05:06.480 --> 05:08.440
For fuck’s sake,
everyone to the ground, damn!

05:10.680 --> 05:11.600
To the ground!

05:15.440 --> 05:16.480
Sit down!

05:17.640 --> 05:19.840
Fucking hell, to the ground!

05:23.280 --> 05:24.360
Make them stop.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.640
Stop!

05:27.560 --> 05:28.600
Stop!

05:28.760 --> 05:30.000
I said, stop!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.640
Everyone sit down.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.760
Sit down.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.560
Sit down, please.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.720
Well, look.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
No, Moscow.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.520
-What?
-First, open eyes.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.560
Look where shoot.

06:34.080 --> 06:34.960
Hold gun.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.280
Relax elbow.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.880
-But, you wear thongs, don’t you?
-I’m not going to wear knickers.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.960
-I’m not wearing, I left it at home.
-No.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.560
Then neither will I.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.000
-With a bare cock you rob.
-Don’t’ be dirty-minded.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.520
-Bare cock.
-The hostages...

06:51.320 --> 06:52.200
Quiet.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.240
What’s the matter?

06:56.920 --> 06:59.800
As time progresses
the hostages will stop being compliant.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.320
When they see there are no releases,
that there isn’t any progress,

07:03.480 --> 07:06.000
their survival instinct
will make them do something.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.960
And what will they do?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.680
The Numismatics people will do
like de Bruce Willis?

07:11.200 --> 07:12.400
Something of that sort, Nairobi.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.080
They’ll try to escape.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.240
Or they’ll escape.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.720
-No.
-That’s possible, it can happen.

07:18.880 --> 07:19.920
We’re armed.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.560
At that point, the other hostages
will stop fearing us.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.080
If that happens, it’s extremely important
to regain control and, in that case,

07:27.360 --> 07:29.240
we’ll do it using empathy,

07:30.920 --> 07:32.360
creating an atmosphere

07:32.520 --> 07:36.120
of much more solid trust than the one
we’ve had until to that moment.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.200
Trust and M-16,
don’t go together, do they?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.560
Then we’ll have to find things
that bring us closer to the hostages.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.440
Let’s see.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.040
What unites people, huh?

07:54.120 --> 07:55.080
Football.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.680
Football is a good example.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.760
But there’s something
that unites people ever more

08:01.280 --> 08:02.440
than football.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.160
Sex?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.600
Yes, sex brings people together,
but in couples.

08:09.760 --> 08:10.720
-Or not.
-Careful.

08:10.880 --> 08:11.840
Usually.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.040
There’s... There are, well...

08:15.280 --> 08:18.720
There are threesomes and even foursomes

08:19.200 --> 08:21.560
-and even structures of group.
-Structures?

08:21.840 --> 08:24.200
But it goes without saying
that there’s no room for that

08:24.520 --> 08:26.320
-in our plan.
-Ay, sorry, guys.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.280
Thank goodness.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.760
With my luck, if we organize an orgy,

08:30.960 --> 08:32.440
I’m sure I’ll have this one behind.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.120
But, Professor,

08:36.360 --> 08:37.760
what unites more than sex?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.000
What unites us?

08:44.680 --> 08:46.200
All of us, I mean.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.400
Well, I’ve become very fond
of you all, but, honestly,

08:51.840 --> 08:52.720
money.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.440
Money.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.320
And we might not have other things,
but we’ll have loads of money.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.360
I’ve been giving it a lot of thought

09:02.560 --> 09:05.960
about how to turn our hostages

09:07.400 --> 09:09.040
into our business partners.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.800
And, well, I’ve come to the conclusion.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.720
Money

09:22.280 --> 09:23.400
or freedom.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.280
Have you ever thought,
I mean like in fantasy,

09:27.880 --> 09:28.960
of putting price to yourself?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.120
I’m telling you I'm in.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.480
Think it over, Mr Torres,
you’ve got two hours.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.920
I have nothing to think over.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.960
I’m talking about the pain,
the pain we’re causing you.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.480
I’m working here better
than I’ve ever worked in my whole life.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.640
What would be a hostage’s minimum salary?

09:45.040 --> 09:47.920
I thought of a million euros,
Just like that, tax free.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.240
You won’t fool me.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.320
-I know perfectly how this works.
-Really?

09:52.400 --> 09:55.040
You know how hard it is,
and you know that your profession

09:55.200 --> 09:56.920
is something that’s in your blood.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.680
I’ve never had a boss like you,
Ms Nairobi.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.720
It's that or the second option.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.800
-Which is the second option?
-Leave just like that, with nothing.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.760
Like I’m telling you, but empty handed.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.360
How will we get
a million euros out of here?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.080
Hidden inside our underwear?

10:13.240 --> 10:16.800
You give me the address
of a first cousin’s of yours, a friend,

10:16.960 --> 10:21.640
and I’ll make sure you receive an envelope
with your money in five, or six months

10:21.720 --> 10:23.440
-after getting out of here.
-Think it over.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.240
It’s different to raise a son
with a million under your mattress.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.400
So...

10:27.560 --> 10:28.480
Freedom

10:30.680 --> 10:31.720
or the money.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.360
One million.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.440
There was a camera,

10:39.600 --> 10:41.000
at the toilets entrance.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.360
And in this corridor
I think there was another one.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.800
So you say that apart from the building
cameras, they installed some more.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.680
Yes, those ones were different.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.920
We were digging a tunnel for them.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.240
It was in the basement.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.080
There was a lot of ammunition.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.200
Enough for a war,
there were boxes full of bullets,

11:02.360 --> 11:04.320
chargers, explosives.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.840
Yes, these three were part of the gang.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.760
They were eight, two of them foreigners.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.280
Could you say if any of them
was the Professor?

11:20.440 --> 11:22.720
Their names were city names.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.120
Berlin.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.920
-Moscow.
-Denver.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.960
-Nairobi.
-Helsinki.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.800
-She is Tokyo.
-This one was Rio.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.680
He was the least dangerous of them.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.320
He was watching Alison.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.520
Was Alison in a different place
from the rest of the hostages?

11:38.880 --> 11:40.160
Yes, sometimes she was taken apart.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.360
One of the foreigners is injured

11:43.120 --> 11:44.280
or dead.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.880
We hit him on the head with a pipe.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.720
Oslo was his name.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.840
If you’ll excuse me, you can have a rest.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.840
You may have a coffee or something to eat.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.480
-Okay.
-Lobo, escort him outside.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.560
Have a sit.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.600
These are Ángel’s glasses.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.680
They inserted a microphone in them,
a Keylock 20-10

12:24.760 --> 12:26.320
with an audio range of 1,500 metres.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.840
They must have done it
when he went in with the paramedics.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.040
Ángel is not a traitor.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.000
Raquel.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.520
I know what’s crossing
your mind right now.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.880
But you were just doing your job.
Any of us would have done the same.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.960
All the evidence pointed at him.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.280
I was also wrong.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.640
THE SECOND IN CHARGE
OF THE HEIST CRISIS

12:59.720 --> 13:01.360
OF THE FÁBRICA DE MONEDA Y TIMBRE

13:01.440 --> 13:03.640
IN COMMA AFTER HAVING
A CAR ACCIDENT

13:31.720 --> 13:33.520
"You have a new message.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.480
Raquel, it’s me again.
Phone me, your voice mailbox is full.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.240
We have him, listen, we have him.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.000
We have the guy
who is helping them from outside.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.840
Yes, it’s Salva, Salva.
Salva, the one that makes cider.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.720
He was in the wreck yard.
He threatened the Russian guy.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.920
For heaven’s sake, he’s using you, damn.
His fingerprints are in the patrol car.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.520
He’s got closer to you
to learn about the investigation.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.480
He’s using you.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.000
To return the phone call press...."

14:05.520 --> 14:08.040
"Hello, it’s Raquel.
I can answer you right now.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.800
If it’s urgent,
leave your message after the beep."

14:11.680 --> 14:14.760
"The voice mailbox of the number
you have dialled is full."

14:16.760 --> 14:18.680
Ángel was phoning me all evening,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.680
But I didn’t pick up his phone calls.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.920
Sixteen phone calls.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.480
He phoned me 16 times.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.200
And I didn’t answer the phone.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.360
"Raquel.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.400
Raquel, it’s Ángel.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.400
Listen to me,
I’m asking you to reconsider.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.000
Look, I can understand your rage.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.520
-I’ve also...."
-Unplug the loudspeaker or turn it down.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.560
"...the first row we’ve had.
I must be an asshole

14:50.960 --> 14:52.560
or whatever you say,"

14:53.000 --> 14:54.520
but I’m not the mole.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.240
I’m not the mole, for heaven’s sake.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.200
"You’ll ruin my life, Raquel.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.200
Phone me.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.080
Raquel."

15:10.400 --> 15:13.080
Why the heck you don’t pick up?

15:13.520 --> 15:16.440
Huh? After 15 year with you,

15:16.600 --> 15:18.320
"besides you like a fucking fool.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.000
And not to get closer to you,
no, because of friendship."

15:21.440 --> 15:22.920
Because of love, do you hear me?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.720
"Because of love.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.640
I’d been very close
to breaking up with everything,"

15:32.720 --> 15:36.320
To ditching Mari Carmen for a bitch
that not even Prieto would fuck.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.760
"Do you hear me? Yes, you’re a bitch."

15:38.880 --> 15:42.720
A selfish and obsessive bitch.
You’re a fucking bitch, a fucking bitch.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.160
A cunt licker.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.400
"A frigid, for fuck’s sake, a...."

16:02.360 --> 16:05.240
"How many punches can you take
before falling on the canvass?

16:07.280 --> 16:09.360
If you are Raquel Murillo, many.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.520
But there’s something wrong in being good
at rolling with the punches."

16:13.600 --> 16:16.400
"Attention, inspector Murillo
is approaching the front wall."

16:16.560 --> 16:19.360
"If the punches don’t cease,
you’ll end up falling down the same.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.520
And when you fall down,

16:21.600 --> 16:24.440
it’ll be as all the punches
were received at the same time."

16:24.640 --> 16:25.520
Raquel!

16:26.280 --> 16:27.720
-Raquel!
-Raquel!

16:29.560 --> 16:30.440
Raquel!

16:30.720 --> 16:32.080
"Murillo stopped hearing,

16:35.440 --> 16:36.320
stopped thinking.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.960
She just walked on.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.760
It was an empty body

16:48.560 --> 16:50.520
searching for all that to end."

16:50.960 --> 16:51.840
Raquel!

16:58.480 --> 16:59.360
Come!

17:02.880 --> 17:03.960
Let’s go, let’s go!

17:07.440 --> 17:10.200
Excuse me, I didn’t quite understand.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.560
Freedom.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.600
-I said I want...
-No, no.

17:22.320 --> 17:25.440
Wait, before you give me
an answer seriously, I want...

17:25.680 --> 17:28.240
I would like to you to take into account
a couple considerations.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.480
The first one is...

17:32.880 --> 17:34.360
You must consider

17:35.680 --> 17:37.520
that you and I have a relationship.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.600
And the second

17:43.720 --> 17:47.120
is that freedom carries
a lot of un unexpected situations,

17:48.360 --> 17:52.920
risks and terrible things, perhaps,
that for me, personally, are scary.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.880
Do you know that eagle chicks

17:58.960 --> 18:00.960
fall off before the right time

18:01.640 --> 18:04.200
and crash on to the rocks?
That makes me scared.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.880
Or baby rabbits, leverets,
that are in their dens.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.720
They see the sunlight,

18:11.240 --> 18:12.160
and come out,

18:19.160 --> 18:23.360
and a wolf breaks their neck in one bite.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.120
That makes me scared.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.440
No, Ariadna? Because...

18:36.160 --> 18:40.080
Perhaps now,
at this particular moment, leaving is

18:40.160 --> 18:41.560
far more dangerous

18:43.240 --> 18:44.240
than staying.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.120
And I wouldn’t like that anything bad
happened to you, Ariadna.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.840
I don’t want you
to become distressed, either.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.120
I don’t want that. I’ll give you
two hours to think about it.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.280
I must leave.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.800
I’m pregnant,
I need to see a gynaecologist,

19:19.440 --> 19:20.760
well, also the orthopaedic surgeon.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.800
Or whatever doctor you see, I don’t know
which specialist I have to see

19:23.880 --> 19:25.360
for a bullet wound in your leg.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.000
It’ll be the internal medicine doctor,
won’t it? I don’t know.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.880
Let’s see, what’s wrong?

19:30.600 --> 19:32.080
The million euros is not appealing enough?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.120
-With that money you can leave ever after.
-It depends.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.560
If the wound becomes gangrenous
and I end up limping...

19:37.720 --> 19:39.640
If that happens,
we’ll think of what to do.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.800
You don’t need to expect for the worst.

19:42.880 --> 19:43.760
I should think.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.600
Besides, you’re very well here,
aren’t you?

19:48.200 --> 19:52.440
You’ve got your own bedroom, Mónica
Gaztambide’s Presidential suite, or not?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.720
You might even miss us...

20:01.120 --> 20:02.240
if you go.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.640
Why are you insisting on me staying?

20:16.760 --> 20:18.440
You won’t have fallen in love,
haven’t you?

20:22.080 --> 20:23.160
It’s not true.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.360
Listen, look at me, are you serious?

20:27.800 --> 20:30.280
-So what if I am serious?
-Let’s see.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.920
-You can’t fall in love in 60 hours.
-Well, in 60 hours.

20:34.440 --> 20:37.880
In 60 hours I shot you,
I extracted the bullet.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.720
You found out you were pregnant,
now abortion yes, abortion no,

20:40.800 --> 20:42.320
shall I break up with my boyfriend.

20:43.760 --> 20:44.880
You have sex with me.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.000
If you give 24 more hours,
I might ask you to marry me.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.360
And then 24 hours later, we get a divorce.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.760
What the fuck does time matter
inside here?

20:55.600 --> 20:57.560
-In the end time is something that...
-All right.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.400
All right, what?

21:01.280 --> 21:02.160
I’ll stay.

21:06.760 --> 21:11.000
But to get married and that
you’ll have to give a little more time.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.600
I don’t know, 16 minutes or so.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.400
RAQUEL’S UNKNOWN’S TELEPHONE

22:18.440 --> 22:19.320
Hello?

22:20.320 --> 22:23.000
Sorry to phone you again.
It’s Raquel’s mother.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.400
As the other day you were
so close to my daughter,

22:25.480 --> 22:29.160
you see, I have an urgent message
from detective Ángel.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.080
"And I can’t get through to her.
Are you near her?"

22:33.200 --> 22:35.320
Not now,
but I’ll be seeing her in a moment.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.040
"If you tell me,
I may be able to talk to her."

22:38.120 --> 22:40.880
Thank you ever so much,
because it seemed important.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.040
What message?

22:42.400 --> 22:43.520
I’ll read it for you.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.560
Yes, "we have him, we have the fucking guy

22:49.720 --> 22:53.320
"who is helping them from outside.
It’s the guy that makes cider,

22:53.400 --> 22:56.680
the one who was in the wreck yard,
the one who threatened"

22:56.840 --> 22:58.440
the Russian guy", one second.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.920
"His fingerprints were in the patrol car.
We have him.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.120
I’m on my way to the tent
and I’ll tell you everything."

23:07.480 --> 23:08.640
Have you written all down?

23:09.600 --> 23:11.560
Yes, don’t worry.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.640
-"I’ll take care of it."
-Well, thank you very much again.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.560
-"Thank you so much."
-You’re welcome.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.120
"The Professor had built a plan down
to the last millimetre.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.200
Each movement of the police,
any possible mistake from his gang,

23:37.400 --> 23:41.400
the hostages’ behaviour,
each variable, everything,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.880
And then, when he thought
everything was under his control,

23:44.960 --> 23:46.480
he found out that it wasn’t so.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.320
It would have never crossed his mind

23:48.400 --> 23:50.880
that to avoid the whole plan
going down the toilet,

23:51.080 --> 23:52.400
he would have to kill.

23:58.160 --> 24:02.040
Kill the mother of the woman
he was falling in love with.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.040
And, of course,

24:04.560 --> 24:06.320
no one is prepared for that."

24:18.600 --> 24:19.640
What did you give me?

24:20.480 --> 24:22.000
An intravenous sedative.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.280
Have you already spoken to the hostages?
What did they say?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.840
So far they’ve confirmed
that they’re building a tunnel.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.120
We’re going to locate the exact position.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.320
And what we already know,
that they are armed up to the teeth.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.200
Raquel.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.480
You’re the most qualified person
to lead this operation,

24:42.840 --> 24:44.880
but it’s high time you had a rest.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.600
Don’t worry about anything.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.280
The superintendent is on his way
to substitute you.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.960
So you can go home for a few hours.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.800
You have to sleep.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.640
Can I make a phone call?

25:02.000 --> 25:02.880
Sure.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.840
Here.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.320
"Salva, it’s Raquel."

25:23.520 --> 25:27.360
Look, I need you to come over
to get me out of here.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.240
This is the worst day of my life"

25:30.880 --> 25:33.760
and I have to get away from this tent,
from this city.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.600
Salva, are you there?

25:36.760 --> 25:38.440
I can’t, there’s something I have to do.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.800
Sure, sure, I understand.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.400
"To phone like this

25:44.360 --> 25:45.640
is a bit...."

25:55.680 --> 25:57.320
-Good morning.
-Hello.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.200
Can I help you?

25:59.560 --> 26:02.000
I’m Salva, your daughter’s friend.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.000
-We spoke on the phone.
-Yes, yes, of course.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.080
Come in, come in.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.240
Thank you.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.560
Thank you.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.560
Come in.

26:33.880 --> 26:34.760
He’s not reacting.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.320
I don’t want to be pessimistic,

26:38.400 --> 26:40.920
but I’m afraid his brain injury
has caused irreversible damage.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.600
What? Are you a neurosurgeon?

26:44.760 --> 26:45.840
We don’t know.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.040
We must take him to a hospital.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.240
He might still have a chance to be cured.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.840
No one leaves.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.320
Do you hear me? With hole or not hole.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.280
-You know what the Professor said.
-I couldn’t care less about the Professor.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.400
Where was the Professor
when the 16 hostages were escaping?

27:00.480 --> 27:03.120
Where was he
when they smashed Oslo’s head?

27:03.960 --> 27:07.360
We open the doors, call the police and let
the paramedics come and take him out.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.840
What the fuck are you talking about?
The rules were clear, no one goes out.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.800
We all agreed, Oslo too.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.920
16 hostages have escaped.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.960
The rules have changed.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.640
The hostages don’t know
what’s happening here, Oslo does.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.160
And so, huh? If he can’t even speak.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.280
Even if he could he wouldn’t betray us.
Damn, let’s vote.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.080
This isn’t a nice democracy.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.360
It isn’t, no.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.920
We open the doors

27:34.280 --> 27:35.880
and we let Oslo out.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.160
No one is leaving.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.720
Berlin.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.120
Oslo isn’t leaving.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.560
Me speak with Oslo before entering.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.680
Wound doesn’t matter.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.280
Death before prison.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.440
You understand?

28:12.520 --> 28:13.400
Yes.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.040
Me take care of Oslo.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.560
I must say, you have a beautiful house.

28:45.840 --> 28:46.920
Thank you very much.

28:47.680 --> 28:51.600
Raquel is not at home.
Poor her, she works so hard...

29:03.160 --> 29:05.480
I was having a coffee.
Would you like to take one?

29:07.400 --> 29:10.200
-I wouldn’t like to bother you.
-It’ll only take me a few minutes.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.760
-Ah, then, thank you very much.
-Very well. Have a seat.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.200
"There are 10,000 ways
to kill an elderly woman,

29:53.960 --> 29:55.920
but the Professor was no hit man.

29:57.080 --> 30:01.040
He was more of a chess player
for whom the world of crime was too big.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.200
So he chose a cleaner
and more intelligent option.

30:09.440 --> 30:13.000
Pour 2.5 milligrams of dioxin
into the old lady’s coffee,

30:16.120 --> 30:18.600
wait until the cardiac arrest
occurred due to the drug

30:20.000 --> 30:21.040
and vanish."

30:23.640 --> 30:24.600
Any sugar?

30:26.120 --> 30:27.720
Yes, please, three spoonful.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.720
You have a sweet tooth, haven’t you?

30:31.800 --> 30:32.720
So have I.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.280
But I shouldn’t.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.760
"Three sugar spoonful and one of dioxin.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.600
In 15 minutes time
she would have a heart attack.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.480
In 30 minutes Raquel
would find her mother’s body.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.640
In an hour, a coroner

30:54.720 --> 30:57.760
would authorize the removal of the body
as it was a cardiovascular heart attack.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.640
No signs of violence,

30:59.800 --> 31:02.600
the victim’s age, the door closed,
inside her home.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.840
There would be no autopsy,
and the Professor knew it."

31:04.920 --> 31:05.800
Thank you.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.200
"Clean and simple."

31:29.080 --> 31:31.080
My daughter didn’t come home last night.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.920
Was she with you?

31:36.800 --> 31:37.680
Well...

31:38.920 --> 31:40.200
Well, actually, she was.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.760
Yesterday we met.

31:43.080 --> 31:43.960
Well.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.960
Did you make love?

31:55.840 --> 31:56.720
Well...

31:58.920 --> 32:00.440
Actually we did.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.160
I’m glad.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.160
Sorry for prying into your life,
but I’m really glad.

32:07.720 --> 32:12.480
My daughter desperately needs to be loved
and someone to make love to her.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.600
And a man who is a good man.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.120
And you seem a good man.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.040
I can see it in your eyes.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.200
Excuse me.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.040
I’ve dropped it.

33:37.200 --> 33:41.360
As we get older we become clumsy...

33:41.800 --> 33:42.880
Excuse me.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.120
Oslo won’t speak again.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.760
I’m very sorry, it’s...

34:16.640 --> 34:18.720
-It’s very tragic.
-You knew about escape?

34:19.680 --> 34:20.560
No.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.200
Denver tell me.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.080
You knew about escape.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.000
Know as such, I didn’t know.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.600
I could hint something,
and I told Denver to help.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.960
They hit him with this pipe

34:47.280 --> 34:48.320
behind back.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.040
Oslo friend.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.160
Me and Oslo, together in war,

34:58.160 --> 34:59.480
peace together,

35:01.000 --> 35:02.280
robberies together,

35:03.320 --> 35:04.800
prison together.

35:05.800 --> 35:06.960
Oslo friend.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.320
You understand, Arturo?

35:12.880 --> 35:13.760
On your knees.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.880
Did you really think
we wouldn’t try to escape,

35:52.720 --> 35:54.240
that we wouldn’t defend ourselves,

35:57.360 --> 36:00.280
that we would stand there
watching how you killed us,

36:02.120 --> 36:04.400
how you tortured us, how you raped us?

36:09.680 --> 36:11.720
One and a thousand times
I would do it again.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.080
If you’re going to do it, hit me hard,
because if you don’t kill me,

36:15.600 --> 36:17.400
I might kill you afterwards.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.120
I came to work

36:25.600 --> 36:26.960
as any other day

36:30.000 --> 36:31.400
without harming anyone,

36:33.760 --> 36:35.400
only to fulfil my duty.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.160
Who do you think the good guys are,
Helsinki?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.480
You?

36:43.840 --> 36:45.320
Finish quickly, please.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.680
Bring me over the dustpan and the mop,
they are there, in that corner, please.

37:07.760 --> 37:08.640
Thank you.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.600
I’ll do it.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.240
"I don’t live in Almazán now,
I live in Madrid.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.600
I have two daughters: Raquel y Laura.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.840
I’ll never go to an old people home.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.360
Raquel is a serious woman,
but she loves me very much."

37:44.160 --> 37:45.040
Excuse me?

37:48.960 --> 37:51.400
"We have him, it’s the cider guy.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.080
His fingerprints were in the patrol car."

37:54.800 --> 37:58.440
-Do you mind if I make a phone call?
-No, of course not.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.840
"Raquel, it’s me again.
Phone me, your voice mailbox is full.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.800
We have him, listen, we have him.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.440
We have the guy
who is helping them from outside.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.440
Yes, it’s Salva, Salva.
Salva, the guy who makes cider.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.200
He was in the wreck yard,
he threatened the Russian guy.

38:23.280 --> 38:27.120
For fuck’s sake, he’s using you, damn.
His fingerprints are in the patrol car.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.880
He’s getting close to you
to know about the investigation.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.880
If you wish to hear the message again,
press 1.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.920
To delete it, press 2.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.480
To save it, press...

38:39.840 --> 38:42.040
Message deleted.
There are no more messages."

38:49.080 --> 38:50.120
No one is answering.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.080
Salva?

39:04.920 --> 39:06.440
But what are you doing here?

39:09.520 --> 39:11.200
This was the thing I had to do.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.800
The only thing, I left your garden
in a really bad state.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.120
Isn’t he adorable?

39:33.400 --> 39:34.280
He’s already told me

39:35.200 --> 39:36.560
you made love.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.840
-Mum.
-What?

39:39.200 --> 39:42.120
I didn’t say anything,
she must have suspected it.

39:43.000 --> 39:43.880
Time to eat.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.640
-Would like some pudding?
-Well, I’ll have to taste them.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.720
If there as tasty as this soup.
It’s the best one I’ve ever tasted

39:53.880 --> 39:56.000
-in a very long time.
-Thank you.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.240
Darling, don’t play with your food.
You’re hardly eating anything.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.000
It’s that job.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.960
It makes her very stressed.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.360
-The kidnapping, have you heard about it?
-Yes.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.680
You’re telling me.

40:09.480 --> 40:12.360
I follow it constantly,
I’m following it in the press.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.560
It’s terrible what’s happening.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.120
I’m all worried.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.760
There was some shooting
inside yesterday, huh?

40:20.040 --> 40:22.400
Wasn’t there, and some explosions.
No, I really...

40:22.600 --> 40:25.120
those people armed to the teeth...

40:25.200 --> 40:27.600
Who knows, any day,
some horrific thing will happen.

40:28.320 --> 40:31.520
"There was shooting yesterday.
Armed to the teeth.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.680
They have at least three M-16.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.760
A Browning ground machine gun.

40:41.720 --> 40:43.520
Retroxil, is a medicine.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.520
In Toledo there has been
an unusual demand."

40:45.680 --> 40:48.400
-Where was the last purchase?
-Here, in Palomeque.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.760
18th of October.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.280
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.080
But, darling...

40:58.880 --> 41:00.240
Every day the same.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.360
Suárez, put me on speakers.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.600
Connect my mobile to the loud speakers.
We have communication with the Inspector.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.560
-Turn it up.
-Well, listen up everyone.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.960
I need you to look for

41:11.120 --> 41:12.800
"all the rural estates
where hunting is allowed"

41:12.960 --> 41:15.360
within 100 kilometres distance
from the pharmacy in Palomeque.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.760
I want a map of Toledo now.
Look for a map,

41:17.840 --> 41:20.280
-perimeter of Palomeque.
-"If they bought the medicines there,"

41:20.440 --> 41:22.000
it means that they were close.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.240
Fuck, how didn’t I realize sooner?
Because they need a place

41:26.320 --> 41:29.880
where they could organize it, where they
could prepare their plan step by step.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.160
They had to do target practice
before entering the Fábrica,

41:33.960 --> 41:36.520
somewhere where the shots and detonations

41:36.680 --> 41:38.680
wouldn’t raise any alarms.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.080
I want some units canvassing
the perimeter of Palomeque

41:41.160 --> 41:43.240
within 100 kilometres, I want them now.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.400
Documentation.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.400
It must be a 100 hectares rural estate.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.200
Look it up in the land registry.

41:48.360 --> 41:50.040
With a house in it.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.160
-Suárez, call me when you find something.
-I will.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.720
You heard her. We have no time to waste,
let’s get them, okay?

41:58.800 --> 42:02.000
That estate, those units.
I want it all, I want it now.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.240
Yes?

42:13.560 --> 42:14.480
Are you all right?

42:15.520 --> 42:17.440
Yes, a bit tired. Come in.

42:18.720 --> 42:22.360
And dazed too.
They had to inject me a sedative

42:22.840 --> 42:25.200
and, the truth, I’m not used to.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.960
I see, I’m not very clearheaded today,
either.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.640
You’ll excuse me, Salva, but I need
to lie down. I need to get some sleep.

42:33.720 --> 42:34.840
Sure, sure.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.640
It’s the time now to make a decision.

42:49.320 --> 42:53.080
You have to choose between being
accomplices and getting a million euros

42:53.800 --> 42:56.760
or being upright people and leaving.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.280
Freedom

43:03.520 --> 43:04.400
or one million euros.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.720
If you stay with us
to see the end of this,

43:09.880 --> 43:13.760
you’ll receive, at home,
20,000 banknotes of 50 euros,

43:14.360 --> 43:15.560
in an air-tight bag

43:16.320 --> 43:17.760
like good ham.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.600
Those who want to leave,
please, cross the line.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.520
What will we do
with those who choose their freedom?

43:46.240 --> 43:48.120
You’ll take them downstairs

43:48.680 --> 43:50.800
to the Fábrica basement

43:50.960 --> 43:52.560
and lock them up there.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.680
I know it’s terrible, but...

43:59.440 --> 44:02.000
precisely those are the ones
that could actually try to rise up

44:02.320 --> 44:03.360
another rebellion.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.440
And I need to protect you.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.360
Why can’t I choose to leave?

44:09.520 --> 44:11.600
Because you’re our top hostage, darling.

44:13.080 --> 44:13.960
Really?

44:14.680 --> 44:16.360
Do we need to explain it to you?

44:17.120 --> 44:18.520
Move aside, you’re in the way.

44:32.800 --> 44:37.160
Okay, time is ticking. Now or never.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.120
You can either cross the line

44:39.480 --> 44:40.840
and leave

44:41.200 --> 44:43.840
or stay with us

44:44.960 --> 44:46.160
and your million euros.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.280
Very good.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.480
Those wanting to leave,
put your hands on your head.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.040
Move forward, through the door
to the loading area.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.640
"What the Professor had gained
was to divide the hostages

45:01.680 --> 45:04.240
into those who would become our partners

45:05.080 --> 45:07.880
and those who could still
complicate things.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.400
At least that’s what we thought.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.280
Yes, Suárez.

45:33.560 --> 45:37.240
Inspector, we have a rural estate.
It matches perfectly the description.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.520
-Where is it?
-"Near Palomeque",

45:39.680 --> 45:41.800
the small town where the pharmacy is.
It’s 640 hectares

45:41.960 --> 45:44.520
"and it’s a private hunting land.
There’s a house too"

45:44.680 --> 45:47.560
big enough to plan a heist
of that magnitude.

45:48.520 --> 45:50.760
-How did you find it?
-"A neighbour in the area

45:50.920 --> 45:53.240
saw a group of youngsters
on the evening of San Juan.

45:53.760 --> 45:56.080
"They didn’t look like hunters,
but all through the summer

45:56.160 --> 45:58.240
-he heard explosions."
-Explosions.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.440
Yes, explosions.
He doesn’t quite know what they were,

46:00.520 --> 46:03.440
"but he’s sure they weren’t
hunting rifles, not with cartridge ."

46:03.720 --> 46:06.320
I send units to the area
and arrange for an intervention team

46:06.480 --> 46:08.760
-"for a possible armed intervention."
-Very good.

46:08.840 --> 46:12.040
Send me the information to my mobile.
As soon as I can I’ll head there.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.320
Lobo, we have the all clear,
we’re setting off.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.400
Units 1, 2 and 3 ready, now!

46:20.440 --> 46:23.880
Salva, look, I’m not feeling well.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.400
Can you drive?

46:27.240 --> 46:29.360
-Yes.
-I need you to drive me to a place.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.920
Everything starts tomorrow.

47:15.000 --> 47:15.880
Sergio.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.520
I want you to promise me one thing.

47:24.280 --> 47:25.720
If things go wrong,

47:27.160 --> 47:28.200
you’ll run away.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.240
You won’t be waiting at the hangar.

47:33.480 --> 47:34.760
Nothing will go wrong.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.120
You know, as I do,
that everything could go wrong.

47:40.800 --> 47:44.000
I’ll only go there if you promise me
that, if things are shot to hell,

47:45.560 --> 47:47.080
you won’t let them catch you.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.200
I won’t promise you that.

47:58.280 --> 48:01.960
Either you promise me now or you won’t
have a captain in charge from now on.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.000
You already know me.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.920
Nothing will go wrong, Andrés.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.680
We’re the Resistance, aren’t we?

48:24.520 --> 48:27.080
"The Professor’s whole life
revolved around just one idea:

48:30.000 --> 48:31.160
Resistance.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.240
His grandfather,

48:35.760 --> 48:39.680
who had resisted next to the partisans
to defeat the fascists in Italia

48:39.760 --> 48:41.280
had taught him that song.

48:43.800 --> 48:44.760
And later on

48:45.920 --> 48:47.160
he taught us."

49:53.680 --> 49:56.520
Six kilometres straight on, and after
the first diversion on the right.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.480
Salva, can you drive a little faster.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.400
You won’t be fined being with me.
You’re driving at 40 km/h.

50:05.720 --> 50:09.760
Yes, true, I’m sorry.
I’m a bit dense today.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.280
Wait for me here.

50:55.560 --> 50:58.480
On the left side
and on the right side too.

51:35.560 --> 51:38.840
No one comes in without wearing a suit.
Whoever is not essential here

51:39.680 --> 51:40.760
stay out of perimeter 1.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.840
"Is it clear?

51:42.160 --> 51:43.160
It’s clear."

51:48.520 --> 51:52.120
We hit the jackpot.
There’s DNA of every type.

51:55.920 --> 51:58.000
"I want the photographers
and the Scientific branch in.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.080
Take photographs of everything."

51:59.240 --> 52:01.640
The whole house has to be raided,
every single corner.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.360
"We are on the first floor.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.280
There’s an attic. It’s amazing.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.560
You won’t believe what we’ve found."

52:21.880 --> 52:22.760
Inspector.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.760
You have to see this.

52:36.760 --> 52:38.240
The whole thing is on the walls.

52:38.800 --> 52:41.480
Timetables, photos, maps.

52:42.840 --> 52:44.240
The whole fucking plan.

52:44.400 --> 52:45.520
We have it, sirs.

52:48.120 --> 52:49.400
"Their time is over."

53:13.000 --> 53:14.960
TO BE CONTINUED
