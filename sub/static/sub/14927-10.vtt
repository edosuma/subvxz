WEBVTT

00:06.940 --> 00:09.477
WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY
DOING BACK THERE?

00:09.510 --> 00:11.779
THEY'VE BEEN BACK THERE
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.148
MAYBE I SHOULD
DONATE SOME BLOOD.

00:14.182 --> 00:14.982
WHAT, TO A CAT?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.417
YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH
TROUBLE WE'RE IN?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.619
IF THAT CAT DIES,
WE'RE GONNA DIE.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.287
DON'T PANIC.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.223
HERE YOU ARE,
MRS. THOMPSON.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.158
WINSTON IS GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

00:24.192 --> 00:27.228
WHOA. WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?!

00:27.261 --> 00:29.397
OUR CAT IS CLINGING
TO A THREAD OF LIFE,

00:29.430 --> 00:32.333
AND YOU'RE FARTING AROUND
WITH SOME BIRD?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.801
THE DOCTOR IS WITH
YOUR CAT, SIR.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.570
YOU SHOULD BE WITH THE CAT,
TOO, RIGHT NOW! COME ON!

00:36.604 --> 00:38.339
CHOP-CHOP!
LET'S GO! DEFCON 4!

00:38.372 --> 00:41.142
ALL HANDS ON DECK!
GET THE LEAD OUT!

00:41.175 --> 00:43.511
START A DRIP
OR SOMETHING.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.147
OH, GOD, DO YOU THINK
THOSE GUYS...

00:46.180 --> 00:48.549
SAW US HIT
FAT PHILLY'S CAT?

00:48.582 --> 00:49.450
HOW COULD THEY NOT?

00:49.483 --> 00:52.153
THEY WERE RIGHT OUT THERE
ON THE SIDEWALK.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.422
OH, MY GOD...

00:55.756 --> 00:58.092
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED?

00:58.126 --> 01:00.228
MAYBE.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.799
HEY, YOU.
YOU GOT NO PET.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:06.767 --> 01:09.737
THE DOCTOR NEEDS A SAMPLE
OF MY DOG'S STOOL.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.106
REALLY?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.780
THIS GUY'S OK.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.498
CLAUDIA, WHAT'S UP WITH
ALL THE TRUCKS OUT THERE?

01:37.531 --> 01:38.699
OH, BIG
PLUMBING PROBLEM.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.668
WE GOTTA REPLACE
THE WHOLE SEWER LINE.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.838
WELL, I HOPE
IT WASN'T ME. HEH HEH.

01:48.742 --> 01:52.246
ACTUALLY,
WE THINK IT WAS.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.415
HEY, I'M KIDDING.
I'M KIDDING.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.851
I'M GONNA GO TAKE
SOME LEMONADE
TO THE GUYS.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.887
ALL RIGHT.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.722
HERE YOU GO,
GUYS.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.726
OOH, I MUST'VE BEEN
IN THE HEAT TOO LONG.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.329
I THINK I SEE
MISS STATEN ISLAND.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.899
HEH HEH.
MRS. STATEN ISLAND.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.900
OH, YEAH.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.034
OK, SHUT UP.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.571
WHY DON'T
YOU STICK YOUR FINGER
IN THAT THERE LEMONADE

02:17.605 --> 02:20.641
AND MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT
SWEETER, HUH?

02:20.674 --> 02:21.509
OK.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.212
YEAH, YEAH.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.883
OH, YEAH!

02:29.917 --> 02:33.754
600 BUCKS TO FIX
A BROKEN CAT'S LEG.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.923
WHAT A RIP.

02:35.956 --> 02:36.757
FOR 600 BUCKS,

02:36.790 --> 02:39.927
I COULD GET YOU
A BLACK-MARKET EAGLE.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.332
GUYS, WHAT DO YOU
GOT IN THE BOX?

02:44.365 --> 02:48.902
OH, IT'S A KITTY.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.873
WOOK AT THE SWEET
WITTLE KITTY.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.677
WHO HURT THE SWEET
WITTLE KITTY?

02:56.710 --> 02:57.745
SEAN RAN HIM OVER.

02:57.778 --> 03:01.282
NOT ALL OF HIM. 3 OF HIS LEGS
ARE STILL GOOD TO GO.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.115
WHERE'S CLAUDIA?

03:02.149 --> 03:03.751
SHE'S OUT BACK.
I GOT TO TALK TO HER.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.253
SHE'S NOT GONNA
WANNA HEAR IT.

03:05.286 --> 03:05.953
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:05.986 --> 03:08.222
WE HAVE THIS
PLUMBING PROBLEM.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.623
OH, REALLY.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.292
AND I THOUGHT
I COULD FIX IT.

03:11.325 --> 03:14.662
GUYS, I HAVE TO RUN A SNAKE
THROUGH THE MAIN SEWER LINE,

03:14.695 --> 03:15.596
SO NOBODY USE THE WATER, OK?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.899
WHAT? I CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL
WITHOUT A SHOWER.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.100
I'LL STINK.

03:20.133 --> 03:23.437
YOU COULD PUT ON EXTRA DEODORANT
AND SIT BY THE GERBIL CAGE.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.773
DID YOU FINISH OFF
THE FRUIT LOOPS?

03:25.806 --> 03:28.409
ENJOY YOUR PUFFED RICE, LOSER.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.345
Sean: AAH! OH, GOD!

03:32.012 --> 03:35.683
HENRY, DID YOU JUST
FLUSH THE TOILET?

03:35.716 --> 03:36.950
YES, I DID.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.687
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?!

03:39.720 --> 03:40.921
YOU YELL AT ME
WHEN I DO,

03:40.954 --> 03:43.524
AND YOU YELL AT ME
WHEN I DON'T!

03:43.557 --> 03:46.994
I'M GOING BACK
TO DIAPERS.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.597
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING
FOR A WEEK LIKE THIS?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.799
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST GET IT FIXED?

03:51.832 --> 03:52.933
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
OUR SEWER LINE

03:52.966 --> 03:55.969
RUNS RIGHT UNDERNEATH OUR
NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.806
SO I WENT NEXT DOOR AND ASKED
MR. O'KEEFE VERY NICELY

03:58.839 --> 04:00.708
IF I COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO HIS YARD.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.975
YOU CAN GO TO HELL,
FINNERTY.

04:02.009 --> 04:06.780
I JUST NEED TO DIG
A LITTLE, TINY TRENCH
THROUGH YOUR BACKYARD.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.317
DIG IT IN YOUR OWN LAWN.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.421
DAMN IT, BRAD. I TOLD YOU
TO CHECK FOR ROCKS.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.956
IT WAS THE HOSE NOZZLE.

04:15.989 --> 04:16.824
LISTEN TO ME, OK?

04:16.857 --> 04:19.427
OUR PIPE RUNS RIGHT
UNDERNEATH THE LAWN.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.963
THAT WAS BAD PLANNING.
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE?

04:23.864 --> 04:25.566
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

04:25.599 --> 04:29.002
I THINK I RAN OVER
THE EXTENSION CORD.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.372
LISTEN TO ME!

04:31.405 --> 04:34.007
WE CAN'T USE OUR TOILET!

04:34.041 --> 04:36.577
GO THINK
OF SOMETHING.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.882
WHAT IS HE DOING IN THERE?
WE EACH GET 5 MINUTES.

04:41.915 --> 04:42.816
THAT WAS THE RULE!

04:42.850 --> 04:46.820
HEY, WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TOOTHPASTE.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.390
HENRY, COME ON. YOU CAN
BRUSH YOUR TEETH AT HOME.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.926
YEAH. WE'RE HERE 'CAUSE
WE CAN'T USE THE TOILETS.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.564
OH...I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.367
GIMME THE MAGAZINE.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.167
OH, MAN.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.770
WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL
MY UNCLE SAL?

05:02.803 --> 05:03.637
NO, THANKS.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.006
WHY NOT? COME ON,
HE'S A BIG CONTRACTOR.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.541
HE KNOWS PEOPLE DOWNTOWN.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.076
I JUST DON'T WANT TO.
THANK YOU.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.078
YO, LILY.

05:11.111 --> 05:15.082
WHAT YOU DOING,
NUMBER 1 OR NUMBER 2?

05:18.952 --> 05:21.021
I'LL CALL SAL.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.558
SO I ASKED HIM,
BUT, MAN, I WISH I HADN'T.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.360
HEY, GUYS, UNCLE SAL'S
BEEN CALLING FOR YOU.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.861
OH, GOD,
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.497
WE'RE DEAD.
WE DEAD.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.498
WHAT'S WITH THE CAT?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.633
FORGET ABOUT THE CAT.
WE'RE THE ONES IN TROUBLE.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.867
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:33.901 --> 05:35.669
CLAUDIA, WE GOT TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT

05:35.703 --> 05:37.771
WHAT YOUR UNCLE SAL
REALLY DOES.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.606
HE'S A CONTRACTOR.

05:38.639 --> 05:42.643
OH, NO, NO. HE'S NOT
JUST A CONTRACTOR.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.813
CAPISCE?

05:46.179 --> 05:46.980
NO.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.149
CLAUDIA, CAPISCE?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.350
NO. NO CAPISCE.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.921
OH, COME ON, THE SIGNS WERE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US ALL ALONG.

05:53.954 --> 05:58.058
[LOUIS PRIMA
SINGING IN ITALIAN]

06:16.577 --> 06:17.611
IT'S A TIE.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.080
YEAH. I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE
A GOOD COLOR FOR YOU.

06:20.113 --> 06:24.084
IT'S NOT
A GOOD COLOR FOR ME.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.958
IT'S A GREAT COLOR
FOR ME.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.631
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW INSULTING THAT IS?

06:37.665 --> 06:39.967
JUST BECAUSE HE'S
AN ITALIAN-AMERICAN

06:40.000 --> 06:41.969
DOES NOT MEAN
HE'S IN THE MOB.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.203
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT SAYING
HE'S IN THE MOB

06:43.236 --> 06:44.672
BECAUSE HE'S
AN ITALIAN-AMERICAN.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.576
I'M SAYING HE'S IN THE MOB
BECAUSE HE'S IN THE MOB!

06:49.477 --> 06:52.045
HEY, WILL YOU TWO GUYS
LOWER YOUR VOICES?

06:52.079 --> 06:56.216
YOU'RE SCARING
THE POOR WITTLE KITTY.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.084
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.153
HIS KITTY VICADIN
SHOULD BE KICKING IN.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.223
THERE'S STILL NO WATER
IN THE BATHROOM.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.025
I KNOW. THEY'LL
BE DONE SOON.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.159
I NEED A SHOWER,

07:06.193 --> 07:08.829
AND WE'RE OUT OF THOSE WET NAPS
FROM THE CHICKEN PLACE.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.632
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
TAKE ANOTHER SHOWER
AT BRAD'S HOUSE?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.501
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.837
SO YOU GOT EVERYTHING
YOU NEED, RIGHT?

07:16.870 --> 07:17.838
YEP.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.106
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.007
BRAD, LISTEN TO ME.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.677
THIS IS NOBODY'S SICK
FANTASY COMING TRUE.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.580
I'M JUST TAKING
A SHOWER.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.782
WHAT?

07:29.683 --> 07:30.718
LEAVE!

07:30.751 --> 07:33.220
GO.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.860
AHEM.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.240
BRAD...
YAAAH!

07:53.273 --> 07:54.775
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.210
I...I FEEL SICK,

07:57.244 --> 07:59.246
AND I'M AFRAID
I'M GONNA THROW UP.

07:59.279 --> 08:04.718
OH, REALLY? OK, WELL,
GO AHEAD. I'LL WAIT.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.257
DO IT!

08:16.764 --> 08:20.133
I CAN'T DO IT
WHEN I'M BEING WATCHED, OK?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.235
HOW ABOUT YOU JUST
HOP IN THE SHOWER?

08:22.269 --> 08:26.807
BRAD, GET OUT.
GET OUT. GIT.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.041
AAH!

08:28.075 --> 08:30.143
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO
PUT A BATHING SUIT ON,

08:30.177 --> 08:34.114
AND I'LL HOSE YOU DOWN
IN THE BACKYARD.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.283
I'M NOT A GERMAN SHEPHERD.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.852
IT'S OK, KITTY.

08:38.886 --> 08:42.723
SHE SAID SHE'S NOT
A GERMAN SHEPHERD.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.892
CLAUDIA, BABY,
I KNOW THIS MUST BE HARD.

08:44.925 --> 08:45.926
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW I'D FEEL

08:45.959 --> 08:48.996
IF I FOUND OUT
MY FAVORITE UNCLE
WAS A CRIMINAL.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.297
WHICH HE IS NOT.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.464
AW, COME ON, BABY.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.234
AREN'T YOU THE LEAST BIT CURIOUS
OF HOW OUR O'KEEFE PROBLEM

08:54.267 --> 08:56.937
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
THIS MORNING?

09:01.308 --> 09:02.643
O'KEEFE?

09:02.676 --> 09:06.580
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY
OUR LITTLE CONVERSATION
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.514
WHAT?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.249
I WASN'T SAYING YOU COULDN'T
DIG OUT MY YARD.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.819
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT WAS DONE RIGHT,

09:11.852 --> 09:14.087
FOR BOTH OUR SAKES,
YOU KNOW.

09:14.121 --> 09:14.888
REALLY?

09:14.922 --> 09:15.823
GOOD MORNING, SEAN.

09:15.856 --> 09:19.326
I DON'T WANNA TAKE UP
ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME.

09:20.027 --> 09:24.231
UH, UNCLE SAL, DID YOU
TALK TO THAT GUY?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.633
WE HAD A NICE CHAT.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.635
TURNS OUT,
HE'S A REASONABLE MAN.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.169
HEY, DON'T TRACK DIRT
IN THE HOUSE.

09:29.202 --> 09:33.273
UH, SAL, THAT GUY'S
NOT A REASONABLE MAN.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.610
OH, YOU'D BE
SURPRISED.

09:38.378 --> 09:42.382
UNCLE SAL JUST HAS
A WAY WITH PEOPLE, OK?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.116
HE ALWAYS HAS.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.185
YOU, YOU'RE
TOO CONFRONTATIONAL.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.254
YEAH, YOU DO HAVE
THAT PROBLEM--

09:47.287 --> 09:49.056
SHUT YOUR MOUTH, EDDIE!

09:49.089 --> 09:50.691
SEE?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.259
JUST FACE FACTS, CLAUDIA.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.961
YOUR UNCLE SAL'S IN THE MOB.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.863
UNCLE SAL'S IN THE MOB?

09:55.896 --> 09:56.864
YEP.

09:56.897 --> 10:00.233
GREAT. NOW
I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL ANYMORE.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.568
OK, UNCLE SAL
IS NOT IN THE MOB.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.171
AND IF HE WERE, WHICH
HE IS NOT, YOU'D STILL
HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.707
CAN HE AT LEAST GET ME
OUT OF DODGE BALL?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.041
OH, SEAN--

10:08.075 --> 10:08.909
HEY, HE'S YOUR UNCLE.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.944
HEY, YOU LISTEN TO ME.
I'M HALF-ITALIAN.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.246
I HAD TO GROW UP
DEALING WITH ALL THESE
STUPID STEREOTYPES.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.183
AND I WILL NOT HAVE YOU
TEACHING OUR KIDS THAT
UNCLE SAL'S IN THE MOB

10:16.216 --> 10:17.317
JUST 'CAUSE
HE'S ITALIAN.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.419
I'M NOT SAYING HE'S IN THE MOB
JUST BECAUSE HE'S ITALIAN.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.955
I'M SAYING HE'S IN THE MOB
BECAUSE THIS MORNING,

10:21.989 --> 10:25.125
HE MADE ME AN OFFER
I COULDN'T REFUSE!

10:28.195 --> 10:31.899
THESE ARE GOOD.
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.233
WHERE'D YOU GET THESE?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.267
HAVANA.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.468
CAN I GET A FEW EXTRAS?

10:35.502 --> 10:39.406
JUST IN CASE
I GET THE URGE TO SMOKE
AND YOU'RE NOT AROUND.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.208
NO.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.978
SAL, I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE HELP YOU'VE GIVEN ME
WITH THE FAMILY.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.815
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I DID A FAVOR FOR YOU,

10:47.848 --> 10:50.417
AND ONE DAY, YOU'LL DO
A FAVOR FOR ME, RIGHT?

10:50.450 --> 10:51.284
RIGHT.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.920
HOW ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON?

10:52.953 --> 10:53.854
WHAT?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.223
YOU SEE THAT LINCOLN?
WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO

10:56.256 --> 10:58.325
IS RUN IT OUT
TO CONEY ISLAND FOR ME.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.359
A COUPLE OF GUYS
WILL PICK IT UP.

10:59.392 --> 11:04.031
YOU CAN TAKE THE BUS BACK.
HERE. USE MY METRO CARD.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.065
SAL, I'D LOVE TO--

11:05.098 --> 11:06.934
THAT CAR IS VERY IMPORTANT
TO AN ASSOCIATE OF MINE,

11:06.967 --> 11:09.369
AND HE'D BE VERY UPSET
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO IT.

11:09.402 --> 11:13.206
THAT'S WHY I'M TRUSTING YOU,
BECAUSE YOU'RE FAMILY.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.208
I'D REALLY LOVE TO.
IT'S JUST, UH...

11:15.242 --> 11:17.044
TODAY I PROMISED
JIMMY AND HENRY
THAT I'D TAKE 'EM--

11:17.077 --> 11:20.380
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE
IF YOU'D DO ME THIS FAVOR.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.453
OH, YEAH.
MMM-MMM-MMM.

11:26.486 --> 11:30.323
THE MOON IS OUT
EARLY TONIGHT!

11:31.224 --> 11:34.361
AND IT IS A FULL MOON.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.262
YES.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.364
WHAT ARE THEY
TALKING ABOUT?

11:37.397 --> 11:38.966
YOUR BUTT IS HANGING OUT.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.934
AW, BOO.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.336
COME ON,
SHOW'S OVER?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.105
HEY, LOOK, I'M MARRIED.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.106
WE DON'T CARE.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.808
YEAH, COME ON,
DROP 'EM.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.409
I'M TAKING A BREAK.

11:49.442 --> 11:53.346
WHOO! JUST AS GOOD GOING
AS IT WAS COMING.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.214
STOP THAT.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.249
WOOF WOOF. ARRRR!

11:56.283 --> 11:59.019
HEY, GUYS,
IS YOUR SISTER HERE?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.153
MAYBE.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.155
TELL HER I BOUGHT HER
A NEW SHAMPOO
AND A CONDITIONER.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.423
IT'S A VOLUMIZER.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.860
BRAD, DO YOU ACTUALLY
THINK LILY LIKES YOU?

12:06.894 --> 12:12.900
YEAH. SHE'S ONLY SHOWERING
AT MY HOUSE NAKED.

12:12.933 --> 12:13.901
BRAD...

12:13.934 --> 12:17.370
HEY, LILY, LOOK WHAT I GOT.
IT'S GOOD FOR OILY.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.872
THAT'S OK.
I CALLED CHRISTINA.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.140
I'M GONNA GO SHOWER
AT HER PLACE.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.242
BUT I THOUGHT EVERYTHING
WAS GOING GREAT.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.978
YOU WERE TRYING
TO SEE ME NAKED.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.947
OK, WE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS.

12:26.980 --> 12:30.117
OH, MY GOSH, YES.
YOU'RE A PERVE.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.919
I'M ACKNOWLEDGING
THE PROBLEMS.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.087
GOOD-BYE, BRAD.
BYE.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.825
I FLUFFED TOWELS FOR YOU.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.395
HERE YOU GO,
MR. KITTY WITTY.

12:42.429 --> 12:46.433
YOU GOTTA STOP TALKING
LIKE THAT, DAD.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.534
LIKE WHAT?

12:47.567 --> 12:48.869
THAT KITTY-WITTY STUFF.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.004
YOU'RE MAKING ME
PHYSICALLY ILL.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.473
HAVE YOU COME TO TERMS
WITH THIS WHOLE THING YET?

12:53.506 --> 12:56.009
SHH...WITH YOUR BEING
A PARANOID PSYCHOPATH?

12:56.043 --> 12:57.945
YEAH, CAME TO TERMS
WITH THAT YEARS AGO.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.980
COME ON, BABY, WAKE UP.

13:00.013 --> 13:00.881
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

13:00.914 --> 13:03.283
HE ASKED YOU TO DO
ONE LITTLE SIMPLE FAVOR.

13:03.316 --> 13:07.087
HEY, IT WAS NEITHER
LITTLE NOR SIMPLE.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.121
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.190
I JUST HOPE THESE GUYS
COME QUICK.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.992
WE GIVE 'EM THE CAR,
AND WE JUST GO HOME.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.928
YEAH, I HOPE IT GOES
DOWN LIKE THAT.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.529
HOW ELSE IS IT
GONNA GO DOWN?

13:16.563 --> 13:17.831
THERE ARE NUMEROUS SCENARIOS,

13:17.865 --> 13:20.433
MANY OF WHICH END WITH US
BEING KILLED.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.235
WHY WOULD WE GET KILLED?

13:22.269 --> 13:23.303
WE KNOW TOO MUCH.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.171
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.973
THEY DON'T KNOW
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.009
FOR ALL THEY KNOW,
WE KNOW SOMETHING.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.577
TSK, YOU'RE
BEING PARANOID.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.278
YOU'RE BEING NAIVE.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.180
THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THIS CAR,

13:33.213 --> 13:34.948
SOMETHING NEFARIOUS.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.249
AW, COME ON.

13:36.283 --> 13:39.086
CHECK THE TRUNK.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.054
I'M NOT CHECKING THE TRUNK.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.055
CHECK THE TRUNK.

13:42.089 --> 13:46.559
I'M NOT BUYING INTO
YOUR PARANOIA, OK?
PERIOD.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.061
IT'S LOCKED.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.263
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

13:50.297 --> 13:51.131
IT'S THIS DAMN VALET KEY.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.065
WHY WOULDN'T THEY
GIVE ME THE REAL KEY?

13:52.099 --> 13:54.534
'CAUSE WHATEVER'S IN THERE
WANTS TO GET OUT.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.070
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
A PERSON IN THERE?

13:57.104 --> 13:59.139
LET'S FIND OUT.

14:05.112 --> 14:05.913
OH, GREAT...

14:05.946 --> 14:09.449
OH, MY...GIMME THAT
REBAR RIGHT THERE.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.985
HURRY, HURRY.

14:22.662 --> 14:26.066
OH, GOD. LOOK,
PULL THE TARP BACK.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.368
YOU PULL THE TARP BACK.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.669
YOU PULL IT BACK.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.171
I'M NOT PULLING IT BACK.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.307
WE'LL PULL IT BACK ON 3,
ALL RIGHT?

14:34.341 --> 14:35.642
1...

14:35.675 --> 14:37.610
2...3.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.648
IT'S VOLLEYBALL
EQUIPMENT.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.051
HE LIKES VOLLEY--
HE'S A VOLLEYBALL MAN.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.653
HE'S A SPORTS ENTHUSIAST.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.523
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
UNDER THE BAG?

15:32.565 --> 15:35.202
WHATEVER THEY'VE HIDDEN,
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.039
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM HERE?

15:39.072 --> 15:43.343
OH, UH, OFFICER, NO.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.646
THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO SEE.
MOVE ALONG.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.714
EXCUSE ME?

15:47.747 --> 15:49.549
WE GOTTA GO!

15:57.324 --> 16:00.460
DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING IN THE CAR,

16:00.493 --> 16:01.194
ANYTHING AT ALL?

16:01.228 --> 16:05.065
THEY HIDE THESE THINGS
VERY WELL.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.767
OR MAYBE THERE WAS NOTHING
IN THE CAR.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.503
THEN WHY DID THE COPS
COME AFTER US?!

16:10.537 --> 16:15.408
BECAUSE YOU WERE
STRIPPING A CAR
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

16:15.442 --> 16:19.412
FORGET IT, SEAN.
SHE'S A MAFIA PRINCESS.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.683
SHE'S TOO CLOSE TO IT
TO SEE THE TRUTH.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.118
IT'S NOT THE TRUTH.

16:25.152 --> 16:29.222
OH, YEAH? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO YOUR UNCLE SAL'S OFFICE?
'CAUSE WE HAVE!

16:36.596 --> 16:37.764
THIS IS IT.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.167
THIS IS THE ADDRESS.

16:42.435 --> 16:46.539
OH, HEY...
HOLD YOUR HORSES, GUY.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.540
ALL RIGHT, ED,

16:47.574 --> 16:49.676
WE'RE GONNA GO IN THERE
AND TELL SAL, "NO DEAL."

16:49.709 --> 16:51.211
YEAH, "THANKS BUT ADIOS."

16:51.244 --> 16:55.615
"FIND SOME OTHER GUYS.
WE'RE NOT YOUR GUYS."

17:02.222 --> 17:03.123
UH-OH.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.258
WE MAY HAVE MADE
A SERIOUS ERROR IN JUDGMENT.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.294
YOU A FRIEND
OF FAT PHILLY?

17:07.327 --> 17:08.295
NO.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.263
THEN I DON'T THINK
YOU WANNA BE HOLDING HIS CAT.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.399
I'M NOT.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.635
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.171
WHAT DO YOU SAY

17:18.205 --> 17:20.507
OK, BYE.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.410
AAAAAHHHHH! I'M COMING!
I'M COMING, ED!

17:23.443 --> 17:27.247
COME ON, COME ON.
COME ON, COME ON.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.488
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

17:37.257 --> 17:39.726
AW, YOU CLIPPED
FAT PHILLY'S CAT.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.561
WHAT?
YOU CLIPPED HIS CAT.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.429
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

17:42.462 --> 17:43.130
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME FOR?

17:43.163 --> 17:45.365
PICK HIM UP!
WHAT? HE'S DINGED.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.300
PICK HIM UP!

17:47.334 --> 17:48.301
YOU GOT A GLOVE?

17:48.335 --> 17:50.370
NO. JUST PICK HIM UP.
COME ON.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.541
LET'S GO, LET'S GO,
LET'S GO.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.111
HE'S DIGGING HIS CLAWS
INTO MY CHEST.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.215
CLAUDIA, LOOK, LOOK.
I KNOW YOU LOVE HIM, OK,

18:02.249 --> 18:04.617
AND I KNOW
HE'S YOUR UNCLE, BUT
YOU GOTTA FACE FACTS--

18:04.651 --> 18:07.454
UNCLE SAL IS A MADE GUY.
HE'S IN THE MOB.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.623
HE'S COSA NOSTRA.
HE'S MAFIA!

18:10.657 --> 18:12.325
SEAN, EDDIE.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.127
SAL...

18:14.861 --> 18:17.230
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO THE CAR?

18:17.264 --> 18:21.901
WELL, UH, SEE,
IT GOT INTO
A LITTLE ACCIDENT.

18:21.934 --> 18:26.306
THE INSIDE OF THE CAR
GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT?

18:27.274 --> 18:29.242
THEY WENT
A LITTLE INSANE.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.312
THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS
A DEAD GUY IN THE CAR.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.813
WHY WOULD
THEY THINK THAT?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.615
BECAUSE...

18:36.249 --> 18:38.651
OK, THIS IS RIDICULOUS
AND INSULTING.

18:38.685 --> 18:42.755
THEY THINK THAT
YOU ARE IN THE MOB.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.623
THE MOB?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.725
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

18:45.758 --> 18:46.659
I KNOW.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.296
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.931
BECAUSE YOU ASKED US
TO TAKE THIS CAR
TO CONEY ISLAND,

18:51.964 --> 18:53.400
RIGHT, WITH THIS
WEIRD KEY,

18:53.433 --> 18:54.534
AND THEN WE OPEN IT

18:54.567 --> 18:55.835
AND THERE'S A BAG
WITH VOLLEYBALLS,

18:55.868 --> 19:00.507
WE GO TO YOUR PLACE,
THERE'S GUYS WITH CHAINS,
AND THEY GOT A TV!

19:00.540 --> 19:03.676
I WAS TRYING
TO TELL HIM...

19:04.477 --> 19:05.212
SAL, I DON'T KNOW.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.714
I JUST--I'M SORRY.
I LOST MY MIND.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.251
YOU LITTLE JERK.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.619
HEH HEH. BIG JERK.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.755
OH, WHO'S THIS?

19:15.788 --> 19:18.291
I CALL HIM MR. MITTENS.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.828
IS THIS
FAT PHILLY'S CAT?!

19:22.695 --> 19:23.663
YEAH.

19:23.696 --> 19:28.835
ARE YOU THE GUYS
WHO RAN OVER
FAT PHILLY'S CAT?

19:28.868 --> 19:30.403
MAYBE.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.604
YOU'RE DEAD.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.439
WHAT?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.674
PHILLY'S A BUTTON MAN.
GOOD GOD, SEAN.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.310
HE'S BROKEN PEOPLE'S ARMS
FOR PETTING THE CAT.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.412
ONE GUY FORGOT TO CHANGE
THE KITTY LITTER,

19:39.446 --> 19:41.981
NOW HE'S PART
OF THE THROGS NECK BRIDGE.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.552
B-B-BUT YOU'RE NOT
PART OF THE MAFIA, RIGHT?

19:45.585 --> 19:49.822
OF COURSE NOT, SWEETHEART.
THERE IS NO MAFIA.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.491
YOU GUYS, YOU SCREWED UP
BIG TIME.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.761
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
MAN, I GOT KIDS.
I CAN'T BE IN A BRIDGE.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.397
OK, OK. TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.333
I THINK I KNOW HOW TO FIX
THIS THING WITH PHILLY,

20:00.367 --> 20:01.534
BUT, UM, IT AIN'T
GONNA BE EASY.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.571
OH, IF YOU COULD,
SAL, GOD BLESS YOU.
OH, PLEASE HELP US.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.373
BUT NOW YOU OWE ME

20:06.406 --> 20:07.274
OH...JEEZ.

20:07.307 --> 20:12.445

I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.813
GIMME THAT.

20:13.846 --> 20:19.419
YOU GUYS DON'T SHOW YOUR FACES
EAST OF GRAND AVENUE, CAPISCE?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.856
I'M SORRY I CAN'T
STAY FOR DINNER.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.625
I'LL SEE YOU

20:25.658 --> 20:26.793
OK. OK. BYE.

BUT IT'S GONNA COST YOU
75 BUCKS TO BE DISPOSED OF.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.755
IT'S A DISPOSAL FEE.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.790
OH, YEAH? WHAT IF I DON'T

20:57.824 --> 21:00.393

21:12.605 --> 21:14.641
I AM CLAUDIA BUSTAMANTE.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.384
HERE'S YOUR $50 BACK.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.518
THANK YOU.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.387
I SAID MOVE IT, MOVE IT.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.388
GOT AN OLD FREEZER
IN THE BASEMENT.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.524
OH, ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE.
JUST MAKE A LIST, MA'AM.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.794

GET THE DOLLY!

21:37.096 --> 21:37.897
CAN WE HELP YOU?

21:37.930 --> 21:38.998
I'M HERE TO SEE A FRIEND.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.867
DOES YOUR FRIEND
HAVE A NAME?

21:40.900 --> 21:43.703
YEAH, MR. MITTENS.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.607
WELL, HELLO, MR. MITTENS.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.776
HOW'S MY PRETTY
WITTLE PUDDY?

21:49.809 --> 21:50.777
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.644
HIS COAT
DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.980
WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU
BEEN FEEDING HIM?

21:54.013 --> 21:54.947
CHICKEN SALAD.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.484
GIVE HIM SOME SARDINES.
HE NEEDS THE FISH OIL.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.886
AND HERE'S A SQUEAKY MOUSE.

21:59.919 --> 22:04.056
GIVE IT TO HIM
AFTER I LEAVE.
