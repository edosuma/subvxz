00:42.567 --> 00:46.700
DISAPPEARANCES HAPPEN--

00:46.733 --> 00:51.300

00:51.333 --> 00:56.033
BLOOD STOPS RUNNING...

00:56.067 --> 00:59.233
AND PEOPLE--

00:59.267 --> 01:01.667
PEOPLE FADE AWAY.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.400

01:08.433 --> 01:11.367
***

01:23.333 --> 01:26.233

01:33.333 --> 01:36.067

01:44.633 --> 01:48.633

01:48.667 --> 01:50.733
I'VE DISAPPEARED.

01:50.767 --> 01:53.667
***

02:08.800 --> 02:10.700
DID YOU CHECK ON KRAMER
IN 2309?

02:10.733 --> 02:13.067
BECAUSE HIS X-RAYS ARE DONE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.600
HIGGINS IN 2312 NEEDS
DIET ORDERS BEFORE HE CAN EAT.

02:15.633 --> 02:17.267
OKAY, DONE AND DONE.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.200
UM, I NEED YOU TO MONITOR
COLLINS IN 2323.

02:19.233 --> 02:21.300
PAGE ME IF HIS SYSTOLIC
DROPS BELOW 90.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.467
I GAVE HIM A LOADING DOSE
OF DIG TO LOWER HIS HEART RATE.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.400
HAVE EITHER OF YOU
SEEN DR. GREY?

02:25.433 --> 02:27.333

02:40.300 --> 02:42.433
IS CHRIS OKAY?
IS HE AWAKE? IS HE...

02:45.300 --> 02:48.533
ANSWER MRS. HEIT,
O'MALLEY.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.100
CHRIS IS FINE.

02:56.133 --> 02:57.633
HE'S GLAD YOU'RE OKAY,

02:57.667 --> 03:00.667
AND HE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU
AFTER SURGERY.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.500
HE'S BEING VERY BRAVE.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.267
THAT'S MY CHRIS.
THAT'S MY BOY.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.467
THANK YOU, DR. O'MALLEY,
SO MUCH.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.433
(Miranda) DR. O'MALLEY.

03:13.467 --> 03:16.100
HOLD UP A SECOND.

03:16.133 --> 03:19.267
SO WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE HAPPY MOTHER IN THERE

03:19.300 --> 03:22.333
WAKES UP AFTER SURGERY AND HER
SON ISN'T THERE TO GREET HER?

03:22.367 --> 03:25.600
WHAT THEN? HOW YOU GONNA
EXPLAIN THAT, O'MALLEY?

03:25.633 --> 03:27.533
IF SHE WAKES UP AFTER SURGERY

03:27.567 --> 03:29.433
BECAUSE MY LIE HELPED
TO SAVE HER LIFE,

03:29.467 --> 03:31.367
I'M OKAY WITH THAT,
DR. BAILEY.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.300
(sighs)

03:33.333 --> 03:35.367
FIND THAT CHILD.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.100
YES, MA'AM.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.633
HER ECHO SHOWED
CARDIAC TAMPONADE.

03:44.667 --> 03:47.533
HMM. SO OUR FIRST PRIORITY
IS STABILIZE

03:47.567 --> 03:51.167
THE TRAUMATIC
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.
WELL, KEEPING MOM ALIVE
MEANS KEEPING BABY ALIVE.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.600
I'LL MONITOR THE SURGERY
WHILE HE OPERATES.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.467
I'LL NOTIFY THE O.R.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.333
(Richard sighs)

04:01.800 --> 04:04.067
CHIEF, WE GOT A MOB SCENE
IN THE CLINIC

04:04.100 --> 04:06.733
OF PEOPLE LOOKING FOR
MISSING FAMILY MEMBERS

04:06.767 --> 04:08.500
AND NOTHING BUT
A 2-HOUR-OLD LIST OF PATIENTS.

04:08.533 --> 04:11.067
NO ONE HAS ANY MORE
INFORMATION THAN YOU DO.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.667
THE POLICE ARE
ASKING US QUESTIONS.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.333
SEARCH AND RESCUE
CAN'T TRACK IT.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.300
WE'LL HAVE TO
DO IT OURSELVES.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.167
IS THERE
SOME KIND OF SYSTEM THAT--

04:18.200 --> 04:20.233
YOU'RE THE SYSTEM, KAREV.

04:20.267 --> 04:23.200
FIGURE IT OUT.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.700
(sighs)

04:26.133 --> 04:27.667
HOW'S SHE DOING?

04:27.700 --> 04:30.700
WELL, WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL
WE GET HER UP TO THE O.R.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.633
IS SHE STILL A JANE DOE?

04:32.667 --> 04:33.667
YEAH.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.600
OH, TO BE IN THAT CONDITION

04:35.633 --> 04:39.300
AND HAVE NO ONE WHO KNOWS YOU
EVEN KNOW...
WHAT?

04:39.333 --> 04:42.333
I MEAN, SHE'S ALL ALONE.
IT MAKES YOU THINK.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.733
YOU KNOW,
IF I WENT MISSING,

04:44.767 --> 04:49.500
WOULD ANYONE NOTICE
I WAS GONE?

04:49.533 --> 04:51.767
(sighs)

04:54.133 --> 04:56.833
(sirens wailing)

04:56.867 --> 04:59.333
DO SOMETHING.
HE'S STILL SEIZING.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.633
THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CAN DO.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.400
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT
SOMETHING IN HIS MOUTH

05:02.433 --> 05:05.167
SO HE DOESN'T BITE
HIS TONGUE, AREN'T YOU?
NOBODY'S PUTTING ANYTHING
IN HIS MOUTH.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.167
WE JUST HAVE TO LET HIM
RIDE IT OUT.
WH-WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.800
YOU JUST CAN'T LET HIM DIE.

05:10.833 --> 05:13.833
TH-THEY'RE GONNA COME SOON--
IN A LITTLE WHILE--

05:13.867 --> 05:17.100
AND THEY'LL GET HIM OUT.
YOU SAID WE DON'T GOT
MUCH TIME.

05:17.133 --> 05:19.533
WHAT IF THEY DON'T GET HIM OUT
FROM THERE BEFORE HE--

05:19.567 --> 05:21.533
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW, OKAY?

05:21.567 --> 05:24.400
I DON'T KNOW.
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T
QUIT ON US NOW.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.233
YOU JUST--YOU JUST
GOTTA TRY SOMETHING ELSE.

05:26.267 --> 05:28.400
I'M OUT OF PRACTICE.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING.

05:28.433 --> 05:31.067
FOR WEEKS,
I'VE JUST BEEN WATCHING.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.567
I...

05:33.600 --> 05:36.233
I'M SORRY.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.733
I'M SORRY.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.667
YOU STOPPED THE BLEEDING.
THAT WAS GOOD.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.533
COME--COME ON.
PLEASE, DOC.

05:46.567 --> 05:50.067
I KNOW THIS GUY.
I BELIEVE IN HIM.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.800
I BELIEVE HE CAN MAKE IT.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.733
YOU GOTTA
BELIEVE IN IT, TOO.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.733
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE
YOU CAN DO THIS.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.800
PLEASE.

05:57.833 --> 06:00.100
DON'T STOP NOW.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.800
WHO'S GOT A CELL PHONE?

06:12.433 --> 06:14.100
YOU GUYS GOOD?

06:14.133 --> 06:15.300
YOU OKAY?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.833
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

06:16.867 --> 06:17.933
NEARLY SEVERED LEG,

06:17.967 --> 06:20.333
BUT HE HAD HIS ARTERY TIED OFF,
SO THAT'S SOMETHING.

06:20.367 --> 06:22.200
YEAH. WHO TIED OFF
THE ARTERY?

06:22.233 --> 06:24.733
WAS IT DR. GREY?
THIS IS HER JACKET.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.500
WE FOUND HIM LIKE THIS.
SHE MUST HAVE MOVED ON.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.567
YEAH, OKAY.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.500
(man) DOC.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.200
YEAH.

06:33.233 --> 06:35.433
WHAT IS IT?

06:35.467 --> 06:37.100
YEAH, JUST STABILIZE
THE FRACTURE

06:37.133 --> 06:40.800
AND GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.800
(siren wailing)

06:49.667 --> 06:51.300
(Derek) HEY.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.300
YOU OKAY?

06:55.667 --> 06:58.200
HEY, DID--DID THE DOCTOR
BRING YOU HERE?

06:58.233 --> 07:01.133
HUH? MEREDITH?

07:01.167 --> 07:04.433
IS MEREDITH OKAY?

07:29.833 --> 07:32.733
(people speaking indistinctly)

07:42.600 --> 07:48.200
HI, MY NAME'S GEORGE.
IS YOUR NAME CHRIS?

07:48.233 --> 07:50.500
IS HE YOURS? THANK YOU.

07:50.533 --> 07:53.433
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.667
(woman) THAT LOOKS LIKE
THE SAME GUY.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.200
(man) IS THAT HIM?

08:00.233 --> 08:02.133
(woman) THAT'S THE MAN
RIGHT THERE.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.733
DO YOU HAVE A NEW LIST?
UH, NOT YET.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.333
NOTHING? HOW CAN THERE BE
NO NEW INFORMATION?
ISN'T THERE
SOMEONE YOU CAN CALL?

08:05.367 --> 08:06.267
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING?

08:06.300 --> 08:09.400
UH, NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING
RIGHT NOW, SO...

08:09.433 --> 08:11.333
(family members
all talking at once)

08:11.367 --> 08:13.267
WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR HOURS WAITING!

08:13.300 --> 08:15.600
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:15.633 --> 08:18.500
QUIET! ALL RIGHT, THAT LIST
IS ALL I HAVE FOR YOU,

08:18.533 --> 08:20.433
AND IT SUCKS, BUT THAT'S IT.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.367
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T
HAVE SOME KIND OF A SYSTEM.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.267
I MEAN--
GIVE ME A MINUTE TO THINK.
I'LL COME UP WITH A DAMN SYSTEM.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.400
(people sighing)

08:35.233 --> 08:37.567
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I UNDERSTAND

08:37.600 --> 08:39.500
YOU'RE UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

08:39.533 --> 08:42.667
IF YOU--IF YOU JUST NEED
TO SIT FOR A MINUTE...

08:42.700 --> 08:46.167
OR IF YOU NEED A HAND...
OR A HUG...

08:46.200 --> 08:47.433
(chuckles)

08:58.533 --> 09:02.100
(monitor beeping)

09:02.133 --> 09:04.800
(cell phone rings)

09:04.833 --> 09:06.500
THIS IS CHIEF WEBBER.

09:06.533 --> 09:08.433
(Izzie) Oh, Chief,
I got a guy here,

09:08.467 --> 09:10.533
and--and we--we can't
extricate him.

09:10.567 --> 09:12.200
HOLD ON.
And I've tried everything.

09:12.233 --> 09:13.533
HOLD--HOLD ON. WHO'S THIS?
It's Izzie Stevens.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.200
I'M AT THE DOCK.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.233
I'VE GOT A PATIENT WITH
A DEPRESSED SKULL FRACTURE

09:17.267 --> 09:18.700
AND PROBABLY
AN INTRACRANIAL BLEED.

09:18.733 --> 09:20.633
IS HE SHOWING SIGNS
OF INCREASED PRESSURE?

09:20.667 --> 09:22.733
Yes. His left pupil is blown.
He's gone limp.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.700
HE'S SEIZING, AND NOW HIS
RIGHT PUPIL IS DILATING.

09:24.733 --> 09:26.767
HE COULD BE HERNIATING. WHAT'S
YOUR E.T.A. TO THE HOSPITAL?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.700
That's what I'm saying.
We can't get him out.

09:28.733 --> 09:30.567
HE'S STUCK UNDER A CAR,
AND WE CAN'T GET HIM OUT.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.467
OKAY, FIRST YOU'VE GOT
TO STAY CALM.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.400
I can't stay calm.
Calm was over minutes ago.

09:34.433 --> 09:36.300
CALM IS GONE.
CALM IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.400
I've got his best friends here,
and I can't let him die.

09:39.433 --> 09:42.700
SO PLEASE JUST TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.767
YOU NEED TO DO
SOME BURR HOLES.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.633
BURR HOLES? I CAN'T DO
BURR HOLES OUT HERE.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.567
Do you want to save
his life, Stevens?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.667
YES.
All right.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.600
I NEED A MINUTE TO CHECK
SOMETHING OUT IN THE BOOK,

09:56.633 --> 09:58.500
AND THEN I'LL TALK YOU
THROUGH IT.
You're looking it up in a book?

09:58.533 --> 10:00.200
I'm not a neurosurgeon,
Stevens,

10:00.233 --> 10:02.700
and I want to make sure
we get this right.

10:02.733 --> 10:07.033
SOMEBODY FIND ME A COPY
OF BOARDMAN'S NEUROSURGERY!

10:07.067 --> 10:08.800
EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:08.833 --> 10:12.800
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MAKING BURR HOLES?

10:12.833 --> 10:14.733
DONE IT A COUPLE OF TIMES.

10:14.767 --> 10:17.533
GOOD. DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

10:17.567 --> 10:18.767
STEVENS, LISTEN TO ME.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.167
(sighs)
I'M GONNA NEED A DRILL.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.100
THERE'S ONE IN MY TRUCK.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.267
WHAT DO YOU NEED
A DRILL FOR?

10:28.300 --> 10:31.133
I'VE GOTTA DRILL HOLES
IN YOUR FRIEND'S HEAD.

10:54.233 --> 10:55.833
UH, HELLO.
I'M SUTURING HERE.

10:55.867 --> 10:57.533
SORRY. I'M--

10:57.567 --> 10:59.467
WHAT ARE YOU--OH, WAIT--
OH, YOU JUST GOT BACK?

10:59.500 --> 11:00.967
UM, I'M LOOKING--

11:01.067 --> 11:03.500
HAVE YOU, UH, SEEN ANY
LOST CHILDREN DOWN HERE?
IS MEREDITH BACK, TOO?

11:03.533 --> 11:05.533
'CAUSE I NEED HER.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
YEAH, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

11:05.567 --> 11:08.167
THIS KID'S MISSING.
HIS MOM'S IN SURGERY.
WHAT KIND OF SURGERY?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.367
THIS KID'S LOST. YOU DIDN'T
SEE IT TODAY, CRISTINA.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.067
YOU WEREN'T OUT THERE.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.633
I KNOW.

11:15.167 --> 11:18.167
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY LOST KIDS
DOWN HERE OR NOT?

11:18.200 --> 11:19.667
NOT.
OKAY.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.600
DO YOU KNOW WHERE,
UH, MEREDITH IS?

11:21.633 --> 11:22.800
I'M LEAVING.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.500
YEAH, I KNOW.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.433
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:26.467 --> 11:28.433
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU CAN
IDENTIFY THE PATIENT,

11:28.467 --> 11:31.133
PLEASE WRITE THEIR NAME
ON THE PICTURE.
I'VE GOT MARKERS.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.733
(Alex)
THESE PATIENTS ARE IN SURGERY,

11:33.767 --> 11:35.633
AND THESE PATIENTS
ARE IN THE I.C.U.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.067
THIS IS FATIMA!

11:37.100 --> 11:38.633
IS SHE OKAY?

11:38.667 --> 11:41.600
UH, YEAH. SHE'S IN--
SHE'S IN THE O.R., STABLE.

11:41.633 --> 11:43.667
(man sobs)

11:43.700 --> 11:45.567
OKAY, ALL THESE PEOPLE

11:45.600 --> 11:47.600
HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED
FROM OTHER HOSPITALS.

11:47.633 --> 11:50.467
OH, AND I HAVE
THE DETAILS.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.300
(people speaking indistinctly)
(Alex) IF IT'S OKAY...

11:53.333 --> 11:56.067
I GOT--I GOT A CASE
I NEED TO CHECK ON.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.433
MM-HMM.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.200
MY HUSBAND'S
NOT ON THAT BOARD.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.133
KELLY WINTER--
SHE'S NOT EITHER.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:03.167 --> 12:06.633
IT'S, UH, IT'S, UH,
THEY COULD BE IN SHOCK OR...

12:06.667 --> 12:08.567
WALKED AWAY
FROM THE SITE OR--

12:08.600 --> 12:10.267
JUST SAY IT.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.300
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED.
THEY'RE DEAD.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.400
W-WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.833
SO HOW CAN WE KNOW?

12:16.867 --> 12:19.233
MY WIFE, SHE WASN'T
IN THESE PHOTOS EITHER.

12:19.267 --> 12:20.733
BUT SHE'S PREGNANT.

12:20.767 --> 12:22.800
IS--IS IT POSSIBLE
YOU JUST DIDN'T SEE HER?

12:22.833 --> 12:25.067
SHE'S PREGNANT?

12:26.467 --> 12:29.367
(sirens wailing)

12:44.233 --> 12:46.367
WHAT? IT'S OKAY.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.767
JUST THINK. WHICH WAY IS SHE?
WHICH WAY?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.133
(police radio chatter)

12:52.167 --> 12:56.067
TAKE YOUR TIME. GOOD.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.367
OKAY.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.067
USE YOUR WORDS.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.500
WHERE EXACTLY IS MEREDITH?

13:25.533 --> 13:28.367
(sirens wailing)

13:50.233 --> 13:53.133
(monitor beeping)

13:53.233 --> 13:54.833
HMM. THE LEAK IN THE HEART

13:54.867 --> 13:56.100
IS COMING FROM
THE RIGHT ATRIUM.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.067
ARE YOU GONNA PUT HER
ON BYPASS?

13:58.067 --> 13:59.800
'CAUSE THAT COULD
COMPROMISE THE BABY.

13:59.833 --> 14:02.167
NO, I CAN FIX HER HEART
WHILE IT'S STILL BEATING.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.233
PUSH 40 MILLIGRAMS
OF ESMOLOL.

14:05.267 --> 14:07.167
I FOUND HER HUSBAND.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.667
I FOUND HIM.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.833
SHE'S NOT A JANE DOE.
HER NAME'S CASEY.

14:10.867 --> 14:12.533
CASEY CLARK.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.767
WHAT?

14:13.800 --> 14:16.133
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WHAT?

14:16.167 --> 14:18.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S CASEY CLARK?

14:18.533 --> 14:20.833
WELL, SHE'S PREGNANT AND--

14:20.867 --> 14:23.167
THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
ON THAT FERRY, ALEX, HUNDREDS,

14:23.200 --> 14:25.333
AND CHANCES ARE THAT MORE
THAN ONE WAS PREGNANT.

14:25.367 --> 14:28.200
NOW DO NOT GIVE THAT MAN HOPE
UNLESS YOU ARE CERTAIN.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.767
DO NOT GIVE HIM HOPE
UNTIL YOU'VE CHECKED

14:30.800 --> 14:32.700
EVERY LAST BODY
IN THE MORGUE.

14:32.733 --> 14:35.233
DR. BURKE, CAN I, UH...

14:35.267 --> 14:37.167
YES, MAKE IT FAST.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.267
(door opens and closes)

14:51.300 --> 14:54.133
(sighs) I GOTTA TELL YOU,
THIS GROUP OF INTERNS...

14:54.167 --> 14:56.367
EMOTIONAL.
HEADSTRONG.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.433
HOTHEADED, STUBBORN.
THEY THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.367
YOU CAN ONLY GIVE THEM
SO MUCH ROPE

15:00.400 --> 15:02.300
BEFORE THEY HANG
THEMSELVES WITH IT.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.533
IT'S LIKE THEY LOSE
ALL RATIONALITY,

15:04.567 --> 15:06.467
DON'T WANT
TO LISTEN TO REASON.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.700
JEEZ, PRESTON.
DON'T HOLD BACK.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.300
(monitor beeping erratically)
SHE'S GETTING HYPOTENSIVE.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.800
I'M SEEING SOME LATE DECELS
ON THE FETAL HEART MONITOR.

15:13.833 --> 15:16.433
THE BABY IS NOT GETTING
ENOUGH BLOOD.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.667
ALMOST... JUST GOT...

15:18.700 --> 15:20.767
ONE MORE STITCH.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.167
GOT IT.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.067
TURN ON THE ECHO.

15:26.067 --> 15:28.267
BABY'S HEART RATE
IS STABILIZED.

15:28.300 --> 15:32.067
GOOD. THEN WE'VE SEEN
THE WORST OF IT.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.433
(Addison sighs)

15:39.533 --> 15:41.833
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

15:41.867 --> 15:44.633
DO YOU KNOW HOW MASSIVE
THIS HOSPITAL IS?

15:44.667 --> 15:46.633
HOW MANY PEOPLE--
NOT JUST SICK PEOPLE...

15:46.667 --> 15:48.567
NOT TO MENTION,
IF I'M A LITTLE KID,

15:48.600 --> 15:50.800
HOW MANY PLACES CAN I HIDE?

15:50.833 --> 15:53.100
HE'S LITTLE. A LITTLE KID
CAN HIDE ANYWHERE.

15:53.133 --> 15:55.067
WHAT, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A KID?

15:55.067 --> 15:57.100
YEAH.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.567
HIS MOM'S IN SURGERY,
AND I, UM...

15:59.600 --> 16:01.800
IF I DON'T FIND HIM,
BAILEY WILL...

16:01.833 --> 16:04.300
WELL, TO START, SHE'LL CHANGE
HER SON'S MIDDLE NAME

16:04.333 --> 16:06.800
TO... ELVIS OR...

16:06.833 --> 16:08.667
TUPPERWARE OR...

16:08.700 --> 16:12.300
I'M NOT KIDDING. ANYTHING
WILL BE BETTER THAN GEORGE.

16:12.333 --> 16:15.067
I KNOW A PLACE A KID MIGHT BE.

16:16.533 --> 16:18.300
REALLY?

16:18.333 --> 16:21.167
(Polaroid camera clicks)

16:26.567 --> 16:28.733
(zips up body bag)

16:28.767 --> 16:30.267
YOU COULDA WARNED ME.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.200
WELL, YOU DIDN'T CHECK
DOWN HERE, RIGHT?

16:32.233 --> 16:33.500
NO.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.067
(Alex) SO STOP WHINING

16:35.067 --> 16:37.367
AND TELL ME
IF YOU FIND A PREGNANT CHICK.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.300
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

16:39.333 --> 16:40.567
WITH A DETAIL THAT SUCKS.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.067
YOU KNOW, I'M SUPPOSED TO DEAL
WITH THESE FREAKED-OUT FAMILIES.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.233
I'M NOT GOOD WITH PEOPLE.

16:45.267 --> 16:47.167
THEY SHOULD JUST
LET ME STICK TO PATIENTS.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.100
PATIENTS ARE PEOPLE,
ESPECIALLY KIDS.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.067
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.767
HE'S FACEDOWN.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.767
HOW DOES THAT...

16:54.800 --> 16:57.633
COME HERE AND HELP ME
TURN HIS BODY RIGHT.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.200
DUDE...

16:59.233 --> 17:01.133
DON'T TELL ME
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:01.167 --> 17:04.367
(sighs)

17:04.400 --> 17:06.200
GOD, I SWEAR TO...

17:06.233 --> 17:08.067
DRAMATIC MUCH?

17:08.100 --> 17:10.567
THIS DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

17:10.600 --> 17:12.467
ANY OF THIS?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.833
ALL THIS DEATH, IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.367
I'M WORKING. WHY WOULD IT?

17:17.400 --> 17:20.500
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S WORKING
AND THEN...

17:23.233 --> 17:27.167
CAUCASIAN FEMALE,
ABOUT 30 YEARS OLD.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.567
SHE'S...

17:28.600 --> 17:30.833
SHE'S PRETTY.

17:30.867 --> 17:34.200
SHE LOOKS ABOUT
SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.133
(Richard) Now remember, Stevens,

17:50.167 --> 17:53.733
that drill isn't just gonna stop
like a neurosurgical drill,

17:53.767 --> 17:55.733
so as soon as you feel
a release in pressure,

17:55.767 --> 17:57.100
stop the drill

17:57.133 --> 17:58.633
or you'll pierce his brain.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.567
EVEN IF I DON'T SEE BLOOD?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.367
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS, STEVENS.
TRUST THE FEEL OF IT.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.133
I'M READY.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.067
NO, WAIT. I NEED TO
CLEAN THE DRILL OFF

18:07.100 --> 18:09.500
one more time.
YOU'VE CLEANED IT
A DOZEN TIMES, STEVENS.

18:09.533 --> 18:11.700
It's as clean
as it's gonna get.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.600
YOU READY?

18:17.133 --> 18:18.100
YES.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.700
Okay.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.667
Place three fingers
above the ear

18:22.700 --> 18:24.800
and two or three fingers
in front of that

18:24.833 --> 18:28.233
on the side
where the first pupil blew.

18:28.267 --> 18:29.467
Got it.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.833
ALL RIGHT.

18:30.867 --> 18:34.100
NOW USE A SCALPEL TO MAKE
A VERTICAL SCALP INCISION

18:34.133 --> 18:36.233
down to the skull.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.633
JEEZ.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.233
I see a lot of blood,
a lot.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.433
SUPERFICIAL BLEEDERS.
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:43.467 --> 18:44.800
ARE YOU AT THE SKULL?

18:44.833 --> 18:46.300
Yes.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.733
Drill a hole in the middle
of the incision.

18:48.767 --> 18:50.133
(exhales)

18:51.633 --> 18:54.100
(whirring)

18:54.133 --> 18:55.200
OH, GOD.

18:55.233 --> 18:56.433
OKAY, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.400
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

18:58.433 --> 19:00.067
SOUNDS CAN'T HAPPEN.
FREAKING OUT CAN'T HAPPEN.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.467
Because if you freak out,
I'm gonna freak out.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.533
AND I'M THE ONE HOLDING A POWER
TOOL TO YOUR FRIEND'S BRAIN.

19:05.567 --> 19:07.067
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA VOMIT,

19:07.100 --> 19:08.833
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SOUNDS,
STEP AWAY.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.700
IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE,
YOU HAVE TO PULL IT TOGETHER.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.433
OKAY?

19:14.467 --> 19:16.767
WE'RE GOOD, DOC.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.300
OKAY.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.700
I'm ready.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.633
THE TEMPORAL BONE'S
ONLY GONNA BE

19:21.667 --> 19:23.567
A COUPLE
OF MILLIMETERS THICK.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.533
(drill whirring)

19:28.767 --> 19:30.433
(exhales)

19:39.533 --> 19:41.200
(stops drill)

19:41.233 --> 19:43.167
OKAY, I'M IN.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.767
But the dura looks fine.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.167
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO IN AGAIN.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.467
Frontal lobe, right?

19:49.500 --> 19:50.833
That's right.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.367
Just behind the hairline,

19:52.400 --> 19:54.300
a few centimeters
off the midline.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.567
(Mark) This bone
will be thicker,

19:56.600 --> 19:59.633
about five times as thick
as the temporal bone.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.100
OKAY. GOT IT.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.133
(whirring)

20:17.500 --> 20:18.833
SECOND HOLE DONE.

20:18.867 --> 20:20.700
What do you see?

20:20.733 --> 20:22.533
I THINK I SEE BLOOD.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.600
I S-SEE SOME BLOOD.

20:24.633 --> 20:27.200
OKAY, NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.133
Drill around the hole
to expand the opening.

20:29.167 --> 20:32.533
You have to try
and relieve the pressure.

20:32.567 --> 20:34.733
OKAY.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.433
(stops drill)

20:40.467 --> 20:43.600
(whirring)

20:43.633 --> 20:44.767
(stops drill)

20:44.800 --> 20:47.533
OKAY. UH, THE HOLE IS ABOUT
2 CENTIMETERS AROUND NOW.

20:47.567 --> 20:49.833
I SEE BLOOD.
I DEFINITELY SEE BLOOD.

20:49.867 --> 20:52.333
TRY TO EVACUATE AS MUCH
OF THE CLOT AS YOU CAN.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.267
With what?
I don't have suction.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.733
USE YOUR FINGER,

20:55.767 --> 20:58.100
gauze, anything.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.800
(groans)
I SEE CLOTTED BLOOD.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.600
NO ARTERIAL?
NO.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.533
Good. Now how does
the dura look?

21:04.567 --> 21:06.600
Is it bulging
or does it look lax?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.300
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S...

21:08.333 --> 21:10.533
pulsating regularly
with the heartbeat.

21:10.567 --> 21:12.833
That's another good, right?
THAT'S GREAT, STEVENS.

21:12.867 --> 21:16.300
If it's pulsating,
that means blood and oxygen

21:16.333 --> 21:17.567
ARE ENTERING THE BRAIN.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.567
OKAY, NOW PACK IT WITH GAUZE SO
YOU CAN MINIMIZE THE BLEEDING.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.800
O-OKAY.

21:21.833 --> 21:24.100
Now get that rescue rig
in here.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.633
NICELY DONE, STEVENS.

21:30.667 --> 21:32.433
IS THAT IT?

21:32.467 --> 21:34.333
IS HE--IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

21:34.367 --> 21:36.267
WE'VE RELIEVED THE PRESSURE
ON HIS BRAIN,

21:36.300 --> 21:38.433
BUT HE'S STILL GOT
A LOT OF OTHER INJURIES.

21:38.467 --> 21:40.267
(man) HEY.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.267
HIS EYES ARE OPEN.

21:44.233 --> 21:46.067
(laughs)

21:46.100 --> 21:47.500
HEY.

21:47.533 --> 21:49.067
(laughs) HEY.

21:49.067 --> 21:50.567
(chuckles)

21:50.600 --> 21:53.300
(Greg laughs)

21:53.333 --> 21:54.833
(siren wails)

21:54.867 --> 21:58.100
***

22:03.167 --> 22:04.733
(man) HEY, KID.

22:04.767 --> 22:08.100
KID.

22:08.133 --> 22:09.500
YOU OKAY?

22:09.533 --> 22:13.733
***

22:13.767 --> 22:16.700
YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME.

22:16.733 --> 22:19.067
KID?

22:19.100 --> 22:21.800
***

22:25.667 --> 22:28.133
(coughing)

22:28.167 --> 22:30.533
(water splashing)

22:30.567 --> 22:33.467
***

22:51.767 --> 22:55.567
(siren wailing)

22:55.600 --> 22:58.333
OUR E.T.A. IS FIVE MINUTES.

22:58.367 --> 23:01.633
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

23:01.667 --> 23:04.567
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

23:06.133 --> 23:08.167
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

23:09.833 --> 23:12.800
(monitor beeping)

23:16.200 --> 23:17.533
HOW IS SHE DOING?

23:17.567 --> 23:19.500
GOOD.
NO INTESTINAL DAMAGE.

23:19.533 --> 23:21.467
MISSED ALL HER VITAL ORGANS.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.767
SHE'S ALMOST DONE HERE.
YOU FIND HER SON?

23:23.800 --> 23:25.467
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.133
I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH
THE SCENE, WITH MERCY WEST,

23:28.167 --> 23:29.467
WITH SEATTLE PRESBYTERIAN.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.800
I'VE CHECKED IN, UH...

23:31.833 --> 23:34.333
HE'S LOST OR...

23:34.367 --> 23:35.700
OR, UH...

23:35.733 --> 23:39.467
HE'S IN THE WATER.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.700
SO WHEN SHE WAKES UP,

23:40.733 --> 23:43.333
I GET TO INFORM HER
THAT SHE'S NOT GOING TO DIE,

23:43.367 --> 23:45.367
SHE'S JUST GONNA WANT TO DIE.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.667
I'M SORRY. I WILL--OKAY,
I'M GONNA KEEP LOOKING.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.233
YEAH, YOU DO THAT.

23:51.267 --> 23:53.167
(siren wailing)

23:53.200 --> 23:55.800
HIS RIGHT PUPIL'S
NOT DILATED ANYMORE,

23:55.833 --> 23:59.100
AND HE'S NORMOTENSIVE, BUT HIS
PULSE IS STILL UP IN THE 130s.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.733
OKAY, WHAT'S HIS
NEUROLOGICAL STATUS?
G.C.S. IS 8.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.667
I'M SORRY.
I RAN OUT OF STERILE DRAPES.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.400
I HAD TO USE SOME GUY'S T-SHIRT.
IT WASN'T SWEATY OR ANYTHING.

24:05.433 --> 24:07.767
HE WAS A CLEAN GUY, BUT--
OKAY, CALL THE O.R.
TELL 'EM WE'RE COMING UP.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.700
I ALSO DROPPED
THE SCALPEL IN THE FIELD,

24:09.733 --> 24:11.600
AND BY THAT TIME, I HAD
USED ALL THE ALCOHOL SWABS

24:11.633 --> 24:14.067
ON THE DRILL BIT, SO I THINK
WE SHOULD LOAD HIM UP

24:14.067 --> 24:15.800
ON ANTIBIOTICS,
LOTS AND LOTS OF ANTIBIOTICS.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.833
STEVENS YOU PUT A DRILL
THROUGH A MAN'S SKULL

24:17.867 --> 24:20.300
AND DIDN'T HIT HIS BRAIN.
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.767
GET CLEANED UP AND GET TO
THE O.R. YOU GOT WORK TO DO.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.733
THE O.R.?

24:24.767 --> 24:26.367
YES, THE O.R.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.633
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
OFF PROBATION.

24:30.633 --> 24:33.133
(sighs)

24:35.233 --> 24:37.800
(Cristina) YEAH.
OH, CRISTINA!
OH, MY GOD.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.733
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST DID.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.733
I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.

24:41.767 --> 24:44.067
YOU'RE GONNA THINK I MADE
THE WHOLE THING UP.
YOU'RE BACK?
IS MEREDITH BACK?

24:44.100 --> 24:45.833
I DRILLED A HOLE
INTO THIS GUY'S SKULL...

24:45.867 --> 24:47.533
WHAT?
SEVERAL HOLES, ACTUALLY,

24:47.567 --> 24:49.467
WITH A DRILL I BORROWED
FROM A GUY NAMED VINCE,

24:49.500 --> 24:51.400
PATCHED THE HOLE
WITH FREAKIN' TISSUE,

24:51.433 --> 24:53.367
THEN BROUGHT HIM BACK HERE,
AND NOW I GET TO SCRUB IN

24:53.400 --> 24:55.300
ON HIS CRANIOTOMY.
SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MEREDITH?

24:55.333 --> 24:57.333
IT WAS LIKE A RIDE,
THIS CRAZY ROLLER COASTER RIDE

24:57.367 --> 24:58.833
WITH ADRENALIN
SHOOTING OUT OF MY EARS.

24:58.867 --> 25:00.567
YOU'D THINK THAT MY HANDS
WOULD BE SHAKING,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.500
BUT THEY WEREN'T.
THERE WAS NO SHAKING.

25:02.533 --> 25:04.433
DID I MENTION THE DRILL?
IZZIE, I GET IT.

25:04.467 --> 25:06.767
YOU ARE A HERO.
I AM JEALOUS.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.800
BUT I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE THE HELL MEREDITH IS.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.833
OKAY. I-I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE HELL MEREDITH IS.

25:11.867 --> 25:14.300
BUT SHE SHOULD BE BACK HERE.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.233
I DIDN'T SEE HER
AT THE SCENE--

25:16.267 --> 25:18.467
THE SCENE WHERE I WAS
A ROCK STAR, BY THE WAY.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.533
DID I MENTION
I'M OFF PROBATION?

25:20.567 --> 25:22.200
(singsongy voice) ROCK STAR.

25:22.233 --> 25:26.200

26:10.367 --> 26:12.833
A FEW MORE BURR HOLES
TO START THE CRANIOTOMY.

26:12.867 --> 26:14.200
REALLY?

26:14.233 --> 26:15.733
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.

26:15.767 --> 26:18.067
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HELP FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.833
AFTER I STRIP OFF
THE PERIOSTEUM,

26:19.867 --> 26:21.767
YOU CAN SEE WHAT A HIGH-SPEED

26:21.800 --> 26:24.467
PNEUMATIC NEUROSURGICAL DRILL
FEELS LIKE.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.133

ONE OF 'EM IS--
SHE--SHE'S IN BAD SHAPE.

27:06.433 --> 27:09.767
SHE'S PRETTY BEAT UP.
SHE MIGHT BE HARD TO RECOGNIZE.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.567
I-I DON'T KNOW.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.233
WHAT COLOR IS HER HAIR?

27:13.267 --> 27:15.200
BROWN. R-REDDISH.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.533
MY WIFE--MY WIFE
IS BLONDE.

27:17.567 --> 27:19.700
BROWNISH, BUT BLONDE.

27:19.733 --> 27:22.600
OH, YEAH. SOMETIMES THE BLOOD
MAKES IT LOOK DARKER LIKE THAT,

27:22.633 --> 27:23.800
YOU KNOW, RED.

27:23.833 --> 27:25.733
I KNOW YOU CAN'T TELL
FROM THE PHOTO,

27:25.767 --> 27:28.167
BUT HER EYES ARE--
THEY'RE PRETTY DISTINCTIVE.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.067
CASEY'S EYES
ARE VERY DISTINCTIVE.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.833
YEAH, BROWN,

DARK BROWN.

MORE--MORE GOLDEN AND--
AND--AND REALLY WARM.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.267
THAT'S NOT HER.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.467

DR. BURKE?

28:59.867 --> 29:02.300
WELL, THE PATIENT IS OUT OF
THE WOODS NOW, DR. YANG.

29:02.333 --> 29:04.600
THANKS FOR ASKING.
OW!

29:19.333 --> 29:21.067
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S BACK.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.400
EVERYONE'S BACK EXCEPT HER.

29:22.433 --> 29:24.333
AND I LISTEN TO HER EVERY DAY
ABOUT HER McLOVE LIFE

29:24.367 --> 29:27.733
AND McDREAMY AND McCRAP,
AND--AND ON THE ONE DAY--

29:27.767 --> 29:29.633
THE ONE DAY
I HAVE A THING--

29:29.667 --> 29:31.067
SHE DISAPPEARS.

29:31.067 --> 29:33.367
MEREDITH?
THIS IS ABOUT MEREDITH?

29:33.400 --> 29:35.733
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YET.
MEREDITH?

29:35.767 --> 29:37.433
SHE'S MY PERSON.

29:37.467 --> 29:40.200
RIGHT.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.267
AND IF MEREDITH
DOESN'T APPROVE,

29:42.300 --> 29:43.767
THEN WHAT?

29:43.800 --> 29:46.667
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS NOT
ABOUT GETTING HER APPROVAL.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.067
IT'S ABOUT--
WHAT?

29:48.067 --> 29:49.667
TELLING HER MAKES IT...

29:49.700 --> 29:52.067
MAKES IT...

29:55.100 --> 29:57.400
IF I MURDERED SOMEONE,
SHE'S THE PERSON I'D CALL

29:57.433 --> 30:00.433

ACROSS THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

30:00.467 --> 30:04.600
OKAY. SEE, NOW YOU'RE LIKENING
SOMEONE HERE TO A CORPSE.

30:04.633 --> 30:06.500

CAN I SEE HIS FACE?

32:00.267 --> 32:02.667
I'M IN THE MIDDLE

32:02.700 --> 32:04.633
I KNOW. I...

32:09.600 --> 32:12.467

PLEASE TELL ME THAT.

32:28.267 --> 32:30.667

SHE GOT LOST.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.200
OH, LISA.

33:31.233 --> 33:33.500
THEY COULD ONLY PUT
A 20-GUAGE I.V. IN,

33:33.533 --> 33:36.633
BUT I THINK IT BLEW.
I'LL START A CENTRAL LINE,

33:36.667 --> 33:38.833
BUT YOU HAVE TO GET
OUT OF THE WAY.

33:38.867 --> 33:41.200
WE--WE PUT, UH, 3 MILLIGRAM
OF EPI DOWN THE E.T. TUBE--
DEREK!

33:41.233 --> 33:43.467
THE LAST DOSE WAS THREE MINUTES
AGO. WE SHOULD PUSH--

33:43.500 --> 33:45.267
SHEPHERD, GET OUT.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.333
I THINK WE SHOULD PUSH
JUST 1 AT-ATROPINE.

33:48.367 --> 33:50.367
I THINK I SAW SOME REACTIVITY
IN HER PUPILS

33:50.400 --> 33:53.233
BEFORE THE ATROPINE,
AND I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE

33:53.267 --> 33:55.300
ACTUALLY HAD
SOME CARDIAC ACTIVITY--
SHEPHERD, GET OUT.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.833
(monitor beeps)

33:56.867 --> 33:59.067
WE NEED TO PUT
AN EXTERNAL PACER ON

33:59.100 --> 34:00.633

34:00.667 --> 34:03.600
WE NEED TO SAVE HER LIFE.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

34:03.633 --> 34:05.467
WE NEED TO DO THIS.
NOW GO.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.467

34:16.433 --> 34:19.467
OKAY, SHE HAS A NEW 18-GUAGE
IN HER LEFT A.C.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.633
PUSH 1 OF EPI THROUGH IT.

34:38.067 --> 34:41.233
THE CHIEF
IS WORKING ON HER, MAN.

34:41.267 --> 34:43.200
HE THREW ME OUT.

34:43.233 --> 34:45.067

34:49.633 --> 34:51.400
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

34:51.433 --> 34:53.333
(sighs)

34:57.633 --> 35:00.400
I NEED YOU TO GO IN THERE.

35:05.767 --> 35:07.667
GIVE ME A NEW WARM BLANKET.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.133
HER TEMP'S STILL ONLY
AT 80 DEGREES.

35:10.167 --> 35:12.533
WHAT CAN I DO?
SHE NEEDS AN A.B.G.

35:12.567 --> 35:14.700
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHOA. WAS THAT V-FIB?

35:14.733 --> 35:17.133
CHARGE TO 300. LET'S GO,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

35:17.167 --> 35:18.467
(defibrillator buzzing)
OKAY.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.067
(Richard) CLEAR.

35:20.067 --> 35:21.100
BACK TO ASYSTOLE.

35:21.133 --> 35:23.167
KEEP COMPRESSIONS GOING.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.233
OH, MY GOD.
SHE'S HYPOTHERMIC.

35:25.267 --> 35:26.833
UH...

35:26.867 --> 35:30.267
HAVE YOU TRIED
A WARM PERITONEAL LAVAGE

35:30.300 --> 35:33.100
OR EVEN A CONTINUOUS
BLADDER LAVAGE WITH WARM FLUIDS?

35:33.133 --> 35:35.433
(Addison) YOU COULD DO
A THORACOTOMY.
GET BACK THE A.B.G.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.233
OKAY, NOW LET'S GO, PEOPLE.

35:37.267 --> 35:40.167
***

36:16.200 --> 36:19.100
***

36:21.667 --> 36:24.067
HOW'S HER TEMP?

36:26.167 --> 36:27.633
ONLY UP TO 81 NOW.

36:27.667 --> 36:30.400
COME ON, MEREDITH.
DON'T DO THIS.

36:30.433 --> 36:33.333
***

36:44.267 --> 36:47.633
***

36:47.667 --> 36:50.500
IT'S MEREDITH?
YEAH.

36:50.533 --> 36:54.067
ARE YOU SURE? DID YOU SEE HER?
BECAUSE IT COULD BE ANYBODY.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.267
OH.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.267
***

37:02.533 --> 37:05.800
OH.

37:05.833 --> 37:07.067
OH. UH...

37:07.067 --> 37:09.767
SHE WILL COME THROUGH THIS.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.567
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.600
SHE WILL COME THROUGH THIS.

37:17.733 --> 37:20.333
PEOPLE DIE.

37:20.367 --> 37:23.633
I KNOW PEOPLE DIE.

37:23.667 --> 37:25.567
PEOPLE DIE IN FRONT OF US
EVERY DAY.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.533
BUT I BELIEVE
MEREDITH WILL SURVIVE THIS.

37:29.567 --> 37:31.533
I BELIEVE...

37:31.567 --> 37:34.700
I BELIEVE--I...

37:34.733 --> 37:36.833
I-I BELIEVE IN THE GOOD.

37:36.867 --> 37:39.567
***

37:42.433 --> 37:45.300
I BELIEVE THAT IT'S BEEN
A HELL OF A YEAR.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.233
AND I BELIEVE THAT IN THE FACE

37:47.267 --> 37:49.833
OF OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY,

37:49.867 --> 37:52.733
WE WILL ALL BE OKAY.

37:52.767 --> 37:55.733
I BELIEVE A LOT OF THINGS.

37:57.700 --> 38:00.233
I BELIEVE THAT...

38:00.267 --> 38:03.167
I BELIEVE THAT DENNY
IS ALWAYS WITH ME.

38:04.700 --> 38:08.067
AND I BELIEVE THAT IF I EAT
A TUB OF BUTTER

38:08.067 --> 38:11.200
AND NO ONE SEES ME,
THE CALORIES DON'T COUNT.

38:11.233 --> 38:15.667
AND I BELIEVE THAT SURGEONS
WHO PREFER STAPLES OVER STITCHES

38:15.700 --> 38:18.700
ARE JUST LAZY.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.467
AND I BELIEVE
THAT YOU ARE A MAN

38:23.500 --> 38:26.767
WHO MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE
MARRYING CALLIE.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.667
AND I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND,

38:29.700 --> 38:32.567
I CAN TELL YOU THIS,
AND WE CAN BE OKAY.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.667
I BELIEVE EVEN THOUGH
YOU MADE THIS MISTAKE,

38:35.700 --> 38:37.767
YOU WILL BE OKAY.

38:41.700 --> 38:44.200
(sighs)

38:47.600 --> 38:51.633
I BELIEVE
WE SURVIVE, GEORGE.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.533
I BELIEVE
THAT BELIEVING WE SURVIVE

38:56.567 --> 39:01.800
IS WHAT MAKES US SURVIVE.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.533
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

39:16.267 --> 39:17.633
(Richard) PUSH ANOTHER EPI.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.467
HOW MANY IS THAT?

39:22.500 --> 39:24.800
THIS IS
HER FOURTH ROUND, SIR.

39:24.833 --> 39:27.233
WE'VE BEEN HERE
20 MINUTES.

39:27.267 --> 39:29.133
STILL IN ASYSTOLE.

39:29.167 --> 39:33.500
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

39:33.533 --> 39:35.433
WE'RE LOSING HER.

39:35.467 --> 39:37.667
(tone continues)

39:45.100 --> 39:48.067
(tone continues)

39:52.567 --> 39:55.467
(tone continues)

39:58.200 --> 40:01.067
(coughing)

40:13.433 --> 40:15.600
(Dylan) HEY.

40:17.133 --> 40:18.600
(Meredith) HEY.

40:21.500 --> 40:25.133
AM I...

40:25.167 --> 40:28.100
DEAD?

40:28.133 --> 40:30.400
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT,
YOU ARE.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.100
HOLY...
