01:35.777 --> 01:38.485
Go easy, boys. Easy.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.650
This damn dog.

01:55.442 --> 01:58.067
For months, he can't recognize me!

01:59.955 --> 02:01.121
Go! You damn dog!

02:06.692 --> 02:11.859
ORDINARY PERSON

02:11.860 --> 02:13.258
Ah, you jerks.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.318
Jerks!

02:18.276 --> 02:19.276
Loyalty, sir!

02:20.610 --> 02:22.401
Hey, don't!

02:26.609 --> 02:28.150
- Pay up?
- Next week.

02:28.151 --> 02:30.741
- Business good?
- It's always next week.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.640
Watch your mouth, you ass.

02:38.093 --> 02:39.801
Sit down, you jerks.

02:41.372 --> 02:42.913
Seong-jin.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.817
Do something about that Swifty.

02:46.397 --> 02:49.105
The Chief called me up again.

02:49.499 --> 02:52.610
Our necks are on the line!

02:52.977 --> 02:55.460
So, do something about Swifty!

02:55.685 --> 02:57.267
Then, give me more time.

02:57.268 --> 02:59.059
Or, more assistance.

02:59.267 --> 03:01.059
It's already here.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.684
Loyalty, sir!

03:07.434 --> 03:08.992
Why're you sitting there?

03:09.017 --> 03:10.892
A detective should be on this side.

03:11.393 --> 03:12.724
I'm sorry, sir. It's because...

03:12.725 --> 03:14.460
I don't have my desk, yet.

03:15.267 --> 03:17.351
My, my.

03:18.017 --> 03:19.934
He looks like a really nice guy.

03:20.684 --> 03:23.725
It was hard to get him.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.017
So teach him well.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.351
It's for him to figure it out.

03:29.059 --> 03:30.517
Hey! Where you going?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.060
To catch Swifty!

03:32.435 --> 03:34.058
Gonna stake out at Jeonnong.

03:34.059 --> 03:36.684
Then drop by that dry cleaners.

03:37.059 --> 03:40.210
Already 3 calls came in about
some blood-stained clothes.

03:40.725 --> 03:42.892
One at a time, please!

03:43.517 --> 03:46.351
You never just listen to me!

03:46.393 --> 03:48.309
The rude bastard!

03:48.892 --> 03:51.085
- Fuckin' baldie.
- That's mine, sir.

03:51.517 --> 03:53.741
- What did you just say?
- Hey! You coming?

03:53.976 --> 03:54.976
Loyalty, sir!

03:56.600 --> 03:59.142
DRY CLEANERS

04:02.017 --> 04:03.725
- So tipsy...
- You're here?

04:04.809 --> 04:08.141
Give me the jeans I
dropped off 2 days ago.

04:08.183 --> 04:09.724
The jeans?

04:12.142 --> 04:13.851
- Let's see.
- How much is it?

04:15.226 --> 04:17.351
Now, where did I put those jeans?

04:22.517 --> 04:24.116
Did you come for the jeans?

04:26.226 --> 04:26.892
No.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.184
No?

04:29.142 --> 04:30.284
Come over here.

04:30.309 --> 04:31.309
Why?

04:31.351 --> 04:32.351
Come over here.

04:32.892 --> 04:34.101
For what?

04:35.600 --> 04:36.642
That's hot!

04:37.309 --> 04:38.599
It's hot!

04:38.600 --> 04:41.350
I done nothing wrong.

04:41.975 --> 04:43.158
He's here. Swifty!

04:43.183 --> 04:43.724
OK!

04:43.766 --> 04:46.158
- I did no wrong, sir.
- What's going on, sir?

04:46.183 --> 04:47.532
- Watch him for me.
- Me?

04:47.557 --> 04:48.723
- Stay put.
- It's that way.

04:48.724 --> 04:50.100
I'm innocent!

04:51.141 --> 04:53.351
Detective, please uncuff me!

04:53.767 --> 04:54.767
Big brother!

04:56.934 --> 04:57.934
See that?

04:58.558 --> 05:00.642
9 out of 10, it's a woman's place.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.142
Isn't it terrific?

05:03.517 --> 05:04.475
It's terrific, sir.

05:04.684 --> 05:05.475
Yeah.

05:05.725 --> 05:07.343
Not the wife, but a woman.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.266
Remember that.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.267
Yes, sir!

05:12.684 --> 05:14.598
- What you looking at?
- Sir?

05:14.599 --> 05:16.139
- Go and catch him!
- Ah!

05:22.849 --> 05:23.849
Hello?

05:25.183 --> 05:27.568
I'm from the Waterworks Agency.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.414
What is it?

05:31.516 --> 05:33.641
The septic tank overflowed.

05:33.642 --> 05:35.507
We're checking the sewer pipes.

05:36.101 --> 05:37.523
Can't you do it later?

05:38.173 --> 05:39.257
I'm a bit busy, now.

05:39.351 --> 05:40.934
If it's not checked,

05:40.976 --> 05:42.266
- it'll stink...
- What you doing, Honey?

05:42.267 --> 05:43.309
Later!

05:44.351 --> 05:45.142
- Honey, run!
- Stop!

05:45.184 --> 05:46.184
Shit!

05:49.266 --> 05:50.334
Ah, come on!

05:50.808 --> 05:52.850
Stop right there! You shit!

06:00.183 --> 06:02.537
I'm Swifty. Who do you...

06:03.599 --> 06:04.724
Well, well.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.724
- Poor you!
- My hair! Hair! Don't pull!

06:07.766 --> 06:09.225
Let go. Let go. Let go.

06:12.359 --> 06:13.359
Let go!

06:14.558 --> 06:15.517
All right! All right!

06:15.518 --> 06:16.874
Let go! Let go!

06:17.059 --> 06:18.891
9 out of 10, it's the rooftop.

06:18.892 --> 06:21.280
- Isn't it terrific?
- Yes, it's terrific!

06:22.392 --> 06:24.233
- Hey, handcuffs!
- Handcuffs!

06:24.641 --> 06:25.641
Shit!

06:27.891 --> 06:28.891
You creep!

06:32.599 --> 06:33.787
What the...?

06:35.868 --> 06:36.868
Shit!

06:39.716 --> 06:41.162
Ah, my knees.

06:42.725 --> 06:43.600
Sir! Are you all right?

06:43.625 --> 06:45.084
Stop! You asshole!

06:48.474 --> 06:49.474
Idiot!

06:50.183 --> 06:50.786
Loyalty, sir!

06:50.995 --> 06:51.599
You jerk!

06:55.206 --> 06:55.991
Hey, you!

06:56.216 --> 06:58.133
- Stop!
- Come down quick!

06:58.175 --> 06:59.258
You're dead!

07:00.383 --> 07:01.834
Honey, let's go!

07:06.341 --> 07:07.174
Sir!

07:07.383 --> 07:08.216
Don't!

07:10.216 --> 07:12.633
That creep is Swifty. Okay?

07:13.341 --> 07:15.133
Catch my drift?

07:16.924 --> 07:18.550
What are you talking about?

07:19.049 --> 07:20.425
Get it or not?

07:21.133 --> 07:22.549
I get it, but...

07:22.550 --> 07:25.633
The Chief calls me up every day!

07:26.258 --> 07:28.717
Before, I almost got hit by his ashtray.

07:28.966 --> 07:32.564
He wants us to catch him no matter what!

07:36.799 --> 07:39.633
Are you telling a detective to lie?

07:40.341 --> 07:43.341
Not lie. Anyway, they're all the same.

07:44.757 --> 07:46.299
That Chief bastard!

07:46.300 --> 07:49.472
He's desperate since
the higher-ups are interested.

07:49.883 --> 07:54.175
I think he took the case
to win the nomination.

07:54.716 --> 07:57.167
You and I, do we have any power?

07:57.841 --> 08:00.300
Let's just make a clean finish.

08:01.675 --> 08:02.722
I trust you!

08:09.507 --> 08:12.650
Seong-jin! Let's get promoted!

08:15.673 --> 08:17.300
Hey, you!

08:27.015 --> 08:30.526
If you're late, I told you
not to come in class.

08:42.331 --> 08:43.703
Hello, Professor.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.433
It's Gyu-nam.

08:45.876 --> 08:48.876
What brings you here?

08:58.841 --> 09:00.300
DECLARATION OF STATE OF AFFAIRS

09:06.924 --> 09:10.862
I saw that you wrote it.

09:14.811 --> 09:17.773
I heard you went to Namsan
(Intelligence Agency HQ).

09:17.969 --> 09:18.969
Yes.

09:19.248 --> 09:22.457
I'm sticking to my principles
and convictions, Professor.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.697
What happened to Gyu-nam who I once knew?

09:34.707 --> 09:36.158
Such innocent

09:38.749 --> 09:39.916
and pure

09:41.541 --> 09:45.749
and immature thoughts

09:45.791 --> 09:48.807
no longer feed this country and its people.

09:49.207 --> 09:50.707
You should know that.

09:51.665 --> 09:53.650
You aren't just feeding yourselves?

09:53.915 --> 09:55.807
Just take me in, instead!

09:57.956 --> 09:59.853
No, not yet.

10:02.665 --> 10:04.455
But, we'll keep an eye on you.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.822
For today,

10:10.749 --> 10:12.248
I'll get going now.

10:20.665 --> 10:21.665
Sit.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.707
FREEDOM DAILY

10:27.248 --> 10:28.248
Hey.

10:31.082 --> 10:32.207
You're in the office.

10:35.415 --> 10:36.415
What is it?

10:37.665 --> 10:40.499
Peace dam. Dam of Fraud?

10:42.332 --> 10:43.332
Sensitive?

10:44.082 --> 10:45.082
Unsettling?

10:45.582 --> 10:46.877
You crazy?

10:48.956 --> 10:50.142
So embarrassing.

10:50.374 --> 10:51.707
So embarrassing.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.884
Not this, 'cause it's sensitive.

10:57.122 --> 10:58.972
Not that, 'cause it's unsettling.

10:58.997 --> 11:01.640
Why have politics and social pages?
Take'em out!

11:01.665 --> 11:02.807
Put in ads!

11:02.832 --> 11:05.846
You know well how it is out there.

11:07.665 --> 11:09.260
The boat leans to the right.

11:09.624 --> 11:11.582
Like this.

11:12.873 --> 11:13.557
Are you all right?

11:13.582 --> 11:14.744
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:17.873 --> 11:21.332
Then, people'll have to lean
to the left to survive.

11:22.998 --> 11:23.848
Hey...

11:23.873 --> 11:24.749
Isn't that common sense?

11:24.750 --> 11:27.001
Is that what a reporter should say?

11:28.164 --> 11:29.954
Is this what you should say?

11:32.790 --> 11:33.790
Geez...

11:34.289 --> 11:35.289
You!

11:36.872 --> 11:38.681
Never walk on the left side!

11:38.997 --> 11:40.626
Keep to the right, you jerk!

11:43.500 --> 11:44.205
Hey, you!

11:44.230 --> 11:47.271
Don't stir things up.
Let's live a quiet life.

11:47.780 --> 11:49.385
Hey! Where're you going?

11:49.832 --> 11:51.392
If only we weren't work buddies.

11:51.624 --> 11:53.998
It's okay.

11:54.749 --> 11:56.349
It's not the first time.

11:56.374 --> 11:57.541
I know.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.688
But, why don't you get married?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.376
You get married!

12:08.252 --> 12:08.919
Hey!

12:09.184 --> 12:10.184
Yes?

12:10.409 --> 12:12.571
I came for the sausages, too!

12:34.164 --> 12:36.274
Crippled jerk's fallen down.

12:37.570 --> 12:39.153
Hey! Spit on him!

12:40.948 --> 12:42.156
Crippled jerk.

12:58.823 --> 13:00.613
If they push, you push back!

13:00.614 --> 13:02.447
If they hit, you have to hit back!

13:04.115 --> 13:06.740
It ends fast if I stay still.

13:10.447 --> 13:12.696
Clench up and hit back hard.

13:13.114 --> 13:15.114
Then, they won't tease you.

13:15.698 --> 13:18.446
Make them feel tired of picking on you.

13:18.447 --> 13:20.243
That's what you have to do.

13:28.698 --> 13:29.906
Drink up.

13:57.322 --> 13:58.322
What?

14:04.990 --> 14:07.906
Boys have fights now and then.

14:08.698 --> 14:11.948
When parents butt in, the kid gets weaker.

14:13.906 --> 14:17.672
Don't ever go to school about this.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.739
Stop pasting envelopes!

14:26.781 --> 14:28.381
How much can you make?

14:28.406 --> 14:29.530
Look at your hand!

14:29.531 --> 14:31.431
Is that a woman's hand?

14:38.447 --> 14:40.352
Tell Min-guk to sleep in his room.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.881
Why let him sleep here?

14:41.906 --> 14:43.243
Makes him weak!

14:56.578 --> 14:59.245
The political scene's unstable,

15:00.072 --> 15:02.055
so I'm focusing on public security.

15:02.321 --> 15:03.321
You should.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.505
And, the entertainers?

15:05.530 --> 15:07.405
We have a rough plan and

15:07.406 --> 15:09.656
we just need 2 to 3 top stars.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.739
Newspapers are already notified.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.613
And we set up close contacts

15:14.614 --> 15:16.948
in various major organizations.

15:16.990 --> 15:18.962
Got anything else more concrete?

15:20.793 --> 15:24.292
Something that'll shock the nation!

15:25.280 --> 15:27.086
Don't be too concerned, sir.

15:29.282 --> 15:32.312
Well, I have high
expectations even this time.

15:32.839 --> 15:33.547
Yes.

15:33.572 --> 15:36.015
If they're all here, let's begin.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.506
Hello, bureau directors!

15:44.409 --> 15:45.484
Have a seat.

15:51.322 --> 15:53.196
Turn your head to the side!

15:53.823 --> 15:56.381
Yeah! I turned my head like this.

15:56.406 --> 15:59.654
Two eyes were in the dark forest.

15:59.655 --> 16:01.946
Flickering. Like animal eyes.

16:01.947 --> 16:03.947
Their eyes were so white!

16:03.989 --> 16:07.487
It gave me the chills and my balls shrunk.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.320
Fuck. I can't speak. I can't stop peeing.

16:10.321 --> 16:12.078
I'm losing my mind.

16:12.588 --> 16:13.338
Then, what?

16:13.363 --> 16:14.334
What do you mean what?

16:14.359 --> 16:16.505
Just turned my head with my eyes on them.

16:16.530 --> 16:19.211
Then, slowly walked away.

16:19.814 --> 16:21.797
You know what was really scary?

16:22.022 --> 16:24.812
Many eyes were in the distance.

16:24.813 --> 16:27.705
Around 30, no, 40 pairs of eyes.
Sons of bitches.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.314
So, what did you do?

16:29.647 --> 16:32.062
So, after going about 10 m,

16:32.063 --> 16:35.896
I notice a grenade dangling on my belt.

16:35.897 --> 16:39.062
Took the pin off behind me and,

16:39.063 --> 16:41.604
Boom! One, two, three. Boom!

16:41.605 --> 16:43.230
I got up and started to run.

16:43.605 --> 16:45.521
I ran about 3 km.

16:45.563 --> 16:46.854
When I got back to the base,

16:46.855 --> 16:49.105
my boots felt really damp.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.521
I looked and blood's gushing out.

16:52.897 --> 16:54.897
This. This.

16:55.354 --> 16:57.437
This is from the shrapnel.

16:57.438 --> 16:58.855
This shin isn't mine.

16:59.563 --> 17:01.396
Wow, that's terrific!

17:01.897 --> 17:03.664
I have nine lives!

17:06.979 --> 17:09.646
- Sir.
- You respect me?

17:11.771 --> 17:14.230
I'm sorry about today.

17:17.438 --> 17:18.438
Here!

17:20.980 --> 17:23.438
Life fuckin' sucks sometimes!

17:24.021 --> 17:27.500
When dark feelings fill your gut,

17:27.855 --> 17:30.147
let it out with a smoke.

17:30.772 --> 17:32.313
We'll get him next time!

17:32.354 --> 17:33.730
You're too nice.

17:34.897 --> 17:36.271
Where's my lighter?

17:42.146 --> 17:43.270
I'll do my best, sir.

17:43.371 --> 17:44.371
Light up.

17:48.882 --> 17:49.883
Oh!

17:50.235 --> 17:51.749
This is from Vietnam.

17:52.022 --> 17:53.625
Was someone in Vietnam?

17:54.913 --> 17:57.663
- Auntie, how much is it?
- Police! Freeze!

17:57.688 --> 17:59.729
You're here! Welcome!

17:59.730 --> 18:02.645
- Where'd you drink so much?
- At the Blue House.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.976
PARK Dong-gyu! Say hello.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.086
Freedom Daily reporter,
CHU Jae-jin.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.496
Hello! I'm PARK Dong-gyu.

18:10.521 --> 18:12.312
Nice to meet you.
I'm CHU Jae-jin.

18:12.353 --> 18:13.229
That's enough.

18:13.230 --> 18:14.603
I'll be going home, now.

18:14.604 --> 18:15.647
- You go, too.
- Yes, sir!

18:15.672 --> 18:16.871
Yeah, go home!

18:16.896 --> 18:18.929
Loyalty, sir! Good bye.

18:22.479 --> 18:24.468
- Can we share the umbrella?
- Sure.

18:30.270 --> 18:33.855
HOME DINER

18:35.189 --> 18:37.789
I live because of you.

18:40.928 --> 18:42.802
I live because of you.

18:44.792 --> 18:45.792
Fuck you.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.636
His name is KIM Tae-sung.

19:00.637 --> 19:02.844
26 years old from the South.

19:02.845 --> 19:04.612
And 2 prior records for theft.

19:04.637 --> 19:07.147
He was talking gibberish,
so it took a long time.

19:11.389 --> 19:13.617
Do you have a place to go in Seoul?

19:14.263 --> 19:15.672
Listen to me carefully.

19:16.805 --> 19:17.805
It's simple.

19:20.804 --> 19:22.444
You go in for a while.

19:23.012 --> 19:26.428
Then, that bastard, the real Swifty,

19:26.429 --> 19:27.889
I'll catch the bastard.

19:28.470 --> 19:30.100
Then, you come right out.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.991
Later, I'll find you a job.

19:34.346 --> 19:37.046
So, go in for a while. Okay?

19:38.429 --> 19:40.221
I don't understand...

19:40.553 --> 19:42.346
You asshole!

19:43.971 --> 19:44.991
Understand?

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
Yes.

19:58.388 --> 20:01.221
Hey! Are you going to just stay quiet?

20:03.595 --> 20:05.069
What do you mean, sir?

20:06.137 --> 20:09.595
Shouldn't you say that it's wrong
or isn't this fabricating?

20:10.720 --> 20:14.096
But, I lost the real Swifty...

20:15.179 --> 20:18.054
As a newbie, you should have
more conviction.

20:18.887 --> 20:20.077
I'm sorry, sir.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.460
It's all right.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.147
Anyway, what was that blood on the jeans?

20:39.637 --> 20:42.944
- Have you seen this guy?
- No.

20:44.137 --> 20:45.929
Damn!

20:46.762 --> 20:49.304
- Let's go!
- Wait for me!

20:56.304 --> 20:57.845
Hey! Where's Swifty?

20:58.179 --> 20:59.470
Haven't seen him.

20:59.845 --> 21:00.929
Hey! Have you seen him?

21:00.971 --> 21:02.345
Haven't seen him at all.

21:04.552 --> 21:05.552
Lady!

21:07.011 --> 21:08.011
Don't know.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.137
LEFTOVER

21:32.096 --> 21:34.928
INTERROGATION REPORT A.K.A. SWIFTY

21:39.970 --> 21:40.970
Loyal...

21:43.573 --> 21:44.573
Reporter CHU.

21:46.136 --> 21:47.136
Me?

21:47.719 --> 21:49.653
It's Dong-gyu. PARK Dong-gyu.

21:49.678 --> 21:51.842
I'm the new detective, PARK Dong-gyu.

21:53.719 --> 21:56.679
Before, with Seong-jin. Oh, I'm sorry.

21:59.309 --> 22:00.695
Is Seong-jin off work?

22:00.720 --> 22:01.981
- Yes, he's gone home.
- Swifty?

22:02.006 --> 22:03.339
All petty criminals..

22:12.057 --> 22:13.529
Did you catch Swifty?

22:19.173 --> 22:20.896
Wow! Bananas!

22:24.295 --> 22:26.545
Dad, can I eat this now?

22:26.587 --> 22:27.587
Sure!

22:29.794 --> 22:31.545
- Eat it.
- Thank you!

22:33.628 --> 22:34.928
Get ready for school.

22:51.253 --> 22:53.128
Here! Have this.

22:54.711 --> 22:55.711
Eat it.

23:10.003 --> 23:11.003
Honey.

23:11.961 --> 23:15.295
Should I quit and make money
in a fancy way?

23:19.378 --> 23:20.378
Never mind.

23:21.628 --> 23:23.467
Have some kimchi soup ready.

23:31.794 --> 23:33.794
How old are you to eat candy?

23:35.128 --> 23:36.545
Have some. Makes you feel good.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.581
Jae-jin!

23:38.587 --> 23:39.520
Detective KANG!

23:39.545 --> 23:40.545
Jae-jin!

23:40.836 --> 23:41.836
Go.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.336
Jae-jin! Hey!

23:44.718 --> 23:46.022
- Detective KANG.
- Let's just go.

23:46.046 --> 23:47.046
What the...?

23:50.960 --> 23:53.419
Ah, this dog's bugging me again.

23:54.460 --> 23:55.466
Go away!

24:01.628 --> 24:03.252
Detective KANG!
The Chief's looking for you.

24:03.253 --> 24:05.256
Yay! It's a promotion!

24:06.628 --> 24:08.287
How did Reporter CHU know?

24:08.669 --> 24:10.919
KANG Seong-jin! You dumb ass!

24:10.961 --> 24:12.270
Are you out of your mind?

24:12.295 --> 24:14.043
You idiot. Get out!

24:14.044 --> 24:15.835
Loyalty, sir! I'll train him, sir!

24:15.836 --> 24:17.146
Get out, you idiot! Loyalty, sir!

24:17.170 --> 24:18.943
Get your act straight!

24:20.253 --> 24:22.336
That reporter CHU. That bastard.

24:23.179 --> 24:24.178
Shit!

24:28.877 --> 24:32.085
That damn CHU Jae-jin.

24:33.127 --> 24:35.002
Does he think I have no pride?

24:38.169 --> 24:40.211
The bastard thinks he's the best.

24:56.919 --> 24:59.627
Hey, Dong-gyu. He's here.

25:00.835 --> 25:02.835
Dong-gyu! Damn!

25:03.252 --> 25:05.161
Yes, I couldn't hear you, sir.

25:06.586 --> 25:08.677
He's here. I'll go after him.

25:10.668 --> 25:12.387
- Fuck.
- Stop! You asshole!

25:12.661 --> 25:13.661
Shit!

25:14.586 --> 25:15.586
Shit!

25:17.043 --> 25:18.320
Stop, you ass!

25:19.937 --> 25:21.020
Hey, you!

25:21.953 --> 25:23.370
Hey! This way!

25:24.563 --> 25:25.563
Fuck!

25:27.669 --> 25:28.710
Get lost, jerk!

25:28.711 --> 25:29.669
Stop right there!

25:29.670 --> 25:30.878
You asshole!

25:34.658 --> 25:35.866
Fuckin' bastard.

25:38.364 --> 25:39.867
Let go! Let go!

25:42.793 --> 25:43.710
It's cold. Cold. Cold.

25:43.711 --> 25:45.918
Mister, what you doing with the cabbage?

25:45.960 --> 25:46.710
Mister, you okay?

25:46.751 --> 25:47.804
Stop right there!

25:48.586 --> 25:49.627
- Dong-gyu!

25:50.502 --> 25:53.109
Fuck. Where'd he go?
I have to catch him!

25:55.767 --> 25:56.767
Dong-gyu!

25:58.262 --> 25:59.512
Fuck.

26:03.669 --> 26:05.211
Bastards.

26:16.710 --> 26:19.195
- You're going down today.
- Ah, fuck!

26:19.544 --> 26:21.234
- Stop, you asshole!
- Fuck!

26:26.364 --> 26:27.364
Ah, fuck!

26:28.546 --> 26:29.749
Spit your gum out.

26:32.835 --> 26:33.668
Boss!

26:33.805 --> 26:35.903
- Spit it out, you asshole.
- I won't, you asshole.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.185
You son of a bitch.

26:37.389 --> 26:38.617
Take his pants off.

26:38.928 --> 26:39.809
His pants?

26:39.834 --> 26:41.167
Stop right there.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.977
- What you doing?
- What are you doing?

26:45.002 --> 26:46.198
What's with the shoe?

26:46.223 --> 26:48.792
Hey, I'm KANG Seong-jin!

26:48.793 --> 26:50.127
You bastard!

26:51.111 --> 26:52.361
What?

26:52.803 --> 26:53.803
Huh?

26:56.127 --> 26:56.918
Damn...

26:56.960 --> 26:58.793
Hey, it's a gun. A gun!

26:59.169 --> 27:00.582
We're fucked. Shit.

27:00.918 --> 27:02.332
Boss'll get killed.

27:02.751 --> 27:06.710
This isn't fake leather. Jerk.
It's leather.

27:07.825 --> 27:08.957
Stay there!

27:16.946 --> 27:18.691
- Stay there!
- Go and get him!

27:22.751 --> 27:24.988
You should've hit the head, you moron!

27:25.710 --> 27:26.706
We're fucked.

27:26.731 --> 27:27.814
Ouch. That hurts.

27:28.158 --> 27:29.158
Oh, no!

27:30.956 --> 27:32.817
I'm on duty, now.

27:37.685 --> 27:39.754
I caught.. caught him! Boss!

27:42.775 --> 27:43.965
Why you little...

27:46.888 --> 27:48.133
<i>Sir! Where are you?</i>

27:48.225 --> 27:50.589
The bastard's never
around when I need him.

27:50.645 --> 27:51.956
<i>Where are you?</i>

27:58.878 --> 27:59.878
Sir!

28:02.752 --> 28:04.023
Come here, you bastard.

28:04.048 --> 28:05.567
Raise arms!

28:11.552 --> 28:13.110
- Dong-gyu.
- Yes, sir.

28:13.135 --> 28:14.343
Call our Captain.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.802
- That we got Swifty.
- Yes, sir.

28:18.434 --> 28:21.016
- You've misunderstood, Sir.
- Congratulations!

28:26.342 --> 28:28.675
- Now, you'll get promoted.
- A promotion?

28:29.217 --> 28:30.323
It's the Chief.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.009
Loyalty, sir!

28:33.217 --> 28:34.217
Loyalty, sir!

28:35.301 --> 28:36.542
I had faith in you.

28:36.718 --> 28:38.317
You did well, as I expected.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.909
Ah, yes. Thank you.

28:41.718 --> 28:44.028
You staked out yourself and caught him?

28:44.218 --> 28:45.218
Yes, well...

28:45.219 --> 28:48.760
I staked out for 3 days in
Myung-dong and arrested him.

28:49.582 --> 28:50.427
Great!

28:50.428 --> 28:52.844
I'll write up a report tomorrow.

28:52.886 --> 28:54.385
All right. Good job!

28:54.843 --> 28:55.843
Damn.

28:57.551 --> 29:00.216
Was that criminal creep more important

29:00.217 --> 29:02.222
than your friend for over 30 years?

29:02.301 --> 29:03.301
Hey!

29:04.384 --> 29:07.009
He'll get at least 5 years in prison.

29:07.843 --> 29:10.089
How'd he feel when you're like this?

29:10.134 --> 29:11.300
I caught the real Swifty.

29:11.301 --> 29:12.301
I did!

29:12.551 --> 29:13.551
Yeah.

29:13.676 --> 29:15.860
- So, you did very well!
- Get away.

29:15.885 --> 29:17.393
What do you want to eat?
I'll buy you everything.

29:17.417 --> 29:18.250
I'm not eating.

29:18.275 --> 29:18.946
Sis!

29:19.259 --> 29:20.842
Sis! Wake up quick!

29:20.843 --> 29:22.737
I have to get him something good.

29:28.353 --> 29:30.331
Some big kid in the neighborhood

29:31.342 --> 29:34.593
pushed Min-guk on the ground
and spat on him,

29:35.600 --> 29:36.980
saying he's crippled.

29:39.525 --> 29:40.691
Then, what happened?

29:40.967 --> 29:43.176
Just stood by so he could overcome.

29:45.926 --> 29:48.342
But, you know what Min-guk said?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.503
He says it ends fast if he stays still.

30:05.675 --> 30:07.534
You apologize. Okay?

30:08.167 --> 30:09.167
Apologize for what?

30:09.668 --> 30:10.834
To KIM Tae-sung.

30:12.376 --> 30:14.292
Fuck! If it wasn't for you.

30:15.542 --> 30:17.126
Do you put lotion on?

30:18.668 --> 30:19.834
Is it a dry patch?

30:21.751 --> 30:23.043
Put on some lotion.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.709
I'll give it to you.

30:26.876 --> 30:28.542
Don't bother.

30:31.459 --> 30:32.779
Can I get your autograph, please?

30:32.959 --> 30:34.333
What are you doing?

30:34.334 --> 30:35.834
You look prettier in person.

30:38.333 --> 30:39.333
Hello, sir.

30:44.792 --> 30:47.167
I see that you're a singer.

30:49.668 --> 30:53.126
So, who did you do it with?

30:56.376 --> 30:57.751
Who did you do it with?

31:01.542 --> 31:03.167
I didn't do marijuana.

31:04.626 --> 31:06.918
I really didn't do marijuana.

31:23.166 --> 31:24.208
Wipe yourself.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.417
I didn't do it.

31:30.501 --> 31:32.793
I brought the major crimes file
that you mentioned.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.625
Did you have lunch?

31:50.917 --> 31:52.208
I heard your senior's replaced.

31:52.583 --> 31:57.042
Yeah, he's very young and ruthless.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.291
He's cold-hearted as hell.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.583
He didn't even glance at
singer JI Young-mi...

32:04.833 --> 32:06.916
You're snooping around again.

32:06.917 --> 32:07.917
Sir, this one.

32:08.417 --> 32:09.834
It's best to put it right here.

32:10.542 --> 32:13.291
That young bastard didn't give
one glance at JI Young-mi?

32:13.292 --> 32:15.918
- Don't know.
- Oh, come on.

32:16.584 --> 32:18.125
You still owe me about the bribing...

32:18.917 --> 32:19.917
You crazy?

32:23.084 --> 32:24.166
Let me get a scoop.

32:27.875 --> 32:29.208
This is top A class...

32:29.249 --> 32:31.958
A major crimes case'll happen.
But, it's quite big.

32:33.249 --> 32:35.332
What is it? Murder? Robbery?

32:35.333 --> 32:38.416
Can't say any more.
Press guideline'll be given later.

32:38.458 --> 32:39.499
I'm going to expose this. I am!

32:39.500 --> 32:40.958
Hey, that's enough!

32:41.166 --> 32:43.375
Yeah, so let's talk as we go.

32:43.708 --> 32:45.916
What is it? Let's help each other.

32:45.917 --> 32:46.957
I don't know.

32:46.958 --> 32:47.958
Come on.

32:50.001 --> 32:52.042
You have to scare him

32:52.833 --> 32:54.792
so he won't talk shit outside.

32:54.875 --> 32:55.875
Got that?

32:57.583 --> 32:58.583
Yes, sir.

33:02.042 --> 33:04.624
I said to look at me!

33:04.625 --> 33:05.833
Hey! Hey!

33:06.208 --> 33:09.416
Go easy. You'll make him pee.

33:09.792 --> 33:13.625
No way. I'll break him until he confesses.

33:13.833 --> 33:15.333
Hey!

33:15.667 --> 33:17.000
Hey!

33:21.917 --> 33:23.124
You asshole!

33:23.125 --> 33:23.958
I...

33:24.125 --> 33:24.916
I'm sorry, sir.

33:25.125 --> 33:25.916
Detective, sir.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.708
I...

33:32.500 --> 33:36.208
I... killed him.

33:37.792 --> 33:41.416
That bastard stole
my mother's hospital bill.

33:43.708 --> 33:45.625
So I stabbed and killed him.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.416
I didn't mean to kill.

33:49.416 --> 33:51.291
But, he stole my money.

33:55.084 --> 33:56.084
I...

33:58.084 --> 33:59.415
You killed him?

34:00.083 --> 34:03.916
Yes, I killed him.

34:08.748 --> 34:10.581
Seong-jin! They're looking for you.

34:12.792 --> 34:13.792
Who is?

34:42.831 --> 34:43.831
Follow us.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.373
Yes. Yes.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.291
Sir, I'm Detective KANG Seong-jin.

35:06.208 --> 35:07.624
Coming to Namsan...

35:08.666 --> 35:10.041
for the first time?

35:11.165 --> 35:12.415
Ah, yes.

35:18.582 --> 35:21.290
We could take care of it ourselves.

35:21.749 --> 35:24.749
But, we have limited man power.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.041
And officers on the job

35:29.457 --> 35:32.832
have pride and work hard too.

35:35.084 --> 35:36.833
So, whether out in the open or in the dark

35:37.375 --> 35:40.582
wouldn't it be all for the
country and the people?

35:41.791 --> 35:42.791
Ah, yes!

35:42.916 --> 35:44.290
The country and people.

35:48.916 --> 35:52.832
It's the case file for KIM Tae-sung
that we investigated.

35:53.374 --> 35:54.374
Yes.

36:00.083 --> 36:02.041
You may go now since you must be busy.

36:02.165 --> 36:03.165
Yes.

36:30.707 --> 36:34.041
<i>Feb. 21. Muan, South Province.</i>

36:34.083 --> 36:37.957
<i>An old couple was slashed and
hit with sickle and mortar.</i>

36:41.540 --> 36:44.748
<i>Feb. 27. Ui-dong, Seoul.</i>

36:44.749 --> 36:48.040
<i>Man in his 30s. Killed with hammer.</i>

36:54.164 --> 36:58.790
<i>Mar. 3. Gwangju, South Province.
71-year-old couple.</i>

36:58.791 --> 37:00.415
<i>Killed with hammer.</i>

37:05.499 --> 37:08.623
<i>Mar. 11. Myeonmok-dong, Seoul.</i>

37:08.624 --> 37:10.790
<i>An old man and kids</i>

37:10.791 --> 37:12.832
<i>killed with stone and razor blade.</i>

37:22.331 --> 37:26.373
<i>17 people were killed in total.</i>

37:48.307 --> 37:49.890
You're worse than a dog!

38:03.023 --> 38:04.231
This spring,

38:04.606 --> 38:07.106
a prosecutor joined
the Intelligence Agency.

38:08.606 --> 38:10.523
He seems to have an exceptional mind.

38:11.898 --> 38:15.689
The way he makes things happen
is exceptional.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.232
That Dam issue too.

38:20.483 --> 38:22.440
Wasn't that great timing?

38:22.441 --> 38:24.024
Democratization or not,

38:24.107 --> 38:25.814
if they blow up the dam
it'll flood the area.

38:25.815 --> 38:27.356
Who wouldn't be scared?

38:27.357 --> 38:28.357
Everyone would.

38:28.441 --> 38:30.148
He's very intelligent!

38:31.564 --> 38:34.939
Anyway, he should be cut off first.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.606
Right now, whether in press or
the entertainment business

38:39.315 --> 38:40.440
or in corporations.

38:41.731 --> 38:43.251
Even the National Assembly's
in a mess!

38:44.440 --> 38:46.939
He's been stirring up everybody.

38:48.106 --> 38:49.814
Yes. I'll look into it again.

38:50.731 --> 38:53.564
Yeah, it won't be easy.

38:54.273 --> 38:55.273
Sir...

38:56.065 --> 38:58.232
Could you check out the foreign press?

38:59.648 --> 39:02.316
Those I know have all been
ordered to return home.

39:03.731 --> 39:06.315
Even if we find something out,
we can't release it in Korea.

39:06.814 --> 39:07.814
All right.

39:09.065 --> 39:12.023
I'll immediately contact
those who we can trust.

39:13.356 --> 39:15.315
Congressman KIM. This way, sir.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.606
You're here to see Mr. CHOI?

39:21.773 --> 39:22.355
Ah, yes.

39:22.564 --> 39:23.564
This way, please.

39:54.523 --> 39:55.731
Why this?

40:14.147 --> 40:15.688
There's no need for you to see...

40:15.980 --> 40:19.606
He's a detective who caught
Korea's first serial killer.

40:19.647 --> 40:21.190
I should see his face.

40:22.023 --> 40:23.813
I'd advise you not to talk much.

40:23.814 --> 40:28.023
Why? You want me out?

40:29.523 --> 40:32.606
No, sir. Let him in.

40:42.152 --> 40:43.152
Loyalty, sir!

40:44.134 --> 40:45.467
You're at Seoul station?

40:45.747 --> 40:46.372
Yes, I am.

40:46.568 --> 40:51.151
Well, you did great work for our country.

40:51.646 --> 40:54.314
Well, what did I...?

40:54.772 --> 40:56.938
How many did that bastard kill?

40:57.646 --> 41:00.231
Seventeen, sir.

41:01.751 --> 41:02.751
All right.

41:04.566 --> 41:05.606
Have a meal before you go.

41:07.424 --> 41:08.424
Show him to his table.

41:13.155 --> 41:14.395
These are additional materials.

41:15.488 --> 41:20.529
Get proper witness statements.
You know what I mean?

41:21.008 --> 41:22.008
Yes.

41:22.326 --> 41:26.493
I was briefed... by chance.

41:27.897 --> 41:29.772
You have a sick son.

41:30.646 --> 41:34.563
It must be very heartbreaking.

41:36.522 --> 41:38.522
Well, that's...

41:38.772 --> 41:42.439
Anyway, you have to restrain
your personal emotions.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.689
Isn't it all for the country?

41:47.384 --> 41:48.384
I almost forgot.

41:51.482 --> 41:56.605
Buy some cookies on your way home.

41:58.022 --> 41:59.439
Your kid'll like them.

42:28.105 --> 42:34.189
KIM TAE-SUNG

42:37.481 --> 42:39.688
The initial investigation was
a total mess.

42:40.314 --> 42:41.897
They call this evidence?

42:42.605 --> 42:44.021
BUCHEON, WEST GWANGJU, SOUTH

42:44.022 --> 42:46.189
They brought everything
from the crime scene.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.397
Hey! Where was this?

42:49.189 --> 42:50.980
- Muan in West, sir.
- In West?

42:51.439 --> 42:52.813
- No, Muan in South, sir.
- Idiot.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.105
UI-DONG, SEOUL

43:00.021 --> 43:01.021
What's this?

43:01.063 --> 43:02.146
It's too different.

43:03.355 --> 43:08.022
Please draw it to look similar,
looking at him.

43:13.439 --> 43:14.355
It's this guy.

43:14.356 --> 43:17.521
You bastard! I'll kill you!

43:17.522 --> 43:19.146
He tried to rape you,

43:19.147 --> 43:22.022
but you resisted and got away.

43:23.189 --> 43:25.105
Thumbprint next to your name.

43:43.992 --> 43:45.034
Let's go. Let's go.

43:56.905 --> 43:58.280
Why'd you steal the peppers?

43:58.946 --> 44:00.113
To make kimchi?

44:02.905 --> 44:05.739
Pepper... Peppers?

44:12.904 --> 44:15.738
Why did I steal the peppers?

44:18.945 --> 44:20.029
Eat up.

44:20.696 --> 44:21.696
Yes, sir.

44:25.489 --> 44:27.488
Such a waste of rice.

44:27.489 --> 44:29.738
<i>I... confess.</i>

44:29.739 --> 44:30.739
Name.

44:31.489 --> 44:37.322
KIM TAE-SUNG.

44:38.905 --> 44:39.988
Give me your hand.

45:03.821 --> 45:05.112
"WHOLE FAMILY MURDERED"

45:07.364 --> 45:08.614
Here's another one.

45:21.154 --> 45:22.904
<i>What now?</i>

45:22.945 --> 45:24.111
Can I see the investigation file

45:24.112 --> 45:26.738
and the list of missing
persons from last month?

45:40.738 --> 45:43.071
Feb. 21. Muan, South.

45:44.112 --> 45:47.072
Feb. 22. Sihung, West.

45:47.697 --> 45:51.321
Feb. 27. Ui-dong, Seoul.

45:51.613 --> 45:54.986
Again. Mar. 2. Cheonan, South.

45:54.987 --> 45:58.195
Mar. 3. Gwangju, South..

45:58.196 --> 46:00.028
Mar. 5. Bucheon. West.

46:00.029 --> 46:02.738
Mar. 11. Seoul.

46:02.904 --> 46:04.487
Commit murder in Muan,

46:04.488 --> 46:07.237
then to the West, and to Seoul.

46:09.654 --> 46:11.112
What is this guy?

46:11.821 --> 46:13.112
Is he superman or something?

46:16.446 --> 46:18.696
RESTRICTED AREA

46:25.903 --> 46:27.195
He went there then...

46:31.821 --> 46:35.612
Feb. 21, Muan, South.
Feb. 22, Sihung, West...

46:35.613 --> 46:39.487
Cheonan, Gwangju, South, and back to West?

46:39.488 --> 46:41.028
How did he move around?

46:41.029 --> 46:42.321
Seong-jin!

46:43.071 --> 46:44.446
- Come with me.
- Where?

46:44.987 --> 46:46.529
Where are we going?

46:47.154 --> 46:48.696
Be patient. We're almost there.

46:49.571 --> 46:52.112
- I'm busy!
- I'm busy, too.

46:53.696 --> 46:56.986
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

47:14.528 --> 47:15.695
Please finish quickly.

47:23.804 --> 47:24.929
What are you up to?

47:26.387 --> 47:28.596
He's the Sihung Bucheon murderer.

47:29.971 --> 47:33.511
What? What you talking about?

47:34.220 --> 47:36.511
This is the real murderer.
Not KIM Tae-sung.

47:38.053 --> 47:40.803
I contacted the detective in charge
but he's scared to talk.

47:43.261 --> 47:44.511
What the fuck are you saying?

47:45.053 --> 47:46.053
Seong-jin.

47:47.220 --> 47:50.304
Do you think he could kill
a bulky man and his family

47:50.596 --> 47:51.721
with a hammer?

47:52.429 --> 47:54.721
He was exempted from the army
for being physically unfit.

47:58.262 --> 47:59.721
Fuck.

48:00.304 --> 48:02.804
He barely graduated
elementary school at 15.

48:05.220 --> 48:06.927
Fuck! Stop it!

48:06.928 --> 48:08.137
Why do you always do this?

48:10.511 --> 48:11.928
Listen, Seong-jin.

48:13.470 --> 48:15.511
This is Namsan's work.

48:16.179 --> 48:17.179
It's a fabrication.

48:18.928 --> 48:20.636
I heard it myself from my sources.

48:22.220 --> 48:24.845
It's no use to investigate cases
if murderer dies.

48:25.678 --> 48:27.470
So, they replaced him with KIM Tae-sung.

48:32.387 --> 48:33.846
You think I'm blind?

48:34.637 --> 48:36.386
That KIM Tae-sung is the murderer!

48:36.387 --> 48:37.512
He confessed to me.

48:39.261 --> 48:41.221
OK. I don't know whether
he's the murderer or not.

48:42.053 --> 48:44.470
But, it's a different case
from those in Seoul.

48:44.720 --> 48:45.845
And, those in South.

48:46.511 --> 48:49.261
So... So what do you want from me?

48:49.636 --> 48:51.928
Why would they fabricate
a non-existent serial killer?

48:56.095 --> 48:57.887
I'm a detective. A public servant.

48:59.179 --> 49:01.012
I just do the tasks given to me.

49:02.261 --> 49:04.302
People don't pay your salary
so you can do that.

49:04.303 --> 49:06.385
Not again! That damn smart talk!

49:06.386 --> 49:07.510
If you look away,

49:07.511 --> 49:09.720
another case'll happen or be fabricated.

49:10.303 --> 49:12.511
Then, they'll make a bigger case.

49:14.095 --> 49:15.595
Why'd they do that?

49:15.928 --> 49:17.427
It's to cover the people's eyes and ears

49:17.428 --> 49:19.137
and even control our minds.

49:21.261 --> 49:22.678
I won't ask you for help.

49:25.137 --> 49:26.137
Just get off the case.

49:26.845 --> 49:27.845
You'll get hurt.

49:33.511 --> 49:36.095
I can't ever do that. You lay off!

49:37.137 --> 49:38.927
I'm working for the country.

49:38.928 --> 49:40.137
Please don't get in the way.

49:40.553 --> 49:43.261
I won't hold back this time, even if you!

49:46.343 --> 49:47.343
Seong-jin!

49:49.011 --> 49:50.136
We are what we are, now.

49:51.136 --> 49:52.594
But, think about your son!

49:52.595 --> 49:54.511
He'll live in a world like hell.

50:01.220 --> 50:02.511
You also stole a car, right?

50:03.095 --> 50:05.928
I can't drive.

50:06.179 --> 50:09.095
Then, you took the bus
everywhere and killed them all?

50:09.553 --> 50:11.928
- Tell me the truth!
- I am.

50:12.595 --> 50:15.303
- I don't even have a license.
- Don't lie!

50:16.511 --> 50:17.511
I'm telling the truth.

50:18.303 --> 50:20.594
I stayed in Seoul all year.

50:27.011 --> 50:29.094
Hey. That KIM Tae-sung.

50:29.927 --> 50:30.927
Yes, sir.

50:32.427 --> 50:33.428
Never mind.

50:35.762 --> 50:36.762
Where are you going, sir?

50:51.803 --> 50:52.803
What is it?

50:54.260 --> 50:56.094
Yes. Well, that's...

50:57.136 --> 50:59.510
Have you secured all witnesses?

51:00.260 --> 51:02.094
Yes, I have.

51:03.969 --> 51:05.302
But, sir,

51:06.385 --> 51:08.719
while looking into KIM Tae-sung...

51:09.844 --> 51:10.886
And?

51:12.136 --> 51:16.095
Actually, I went to Sihung today.

51:17.386 --> 51:18.386
Sihung?

51:19.386 --> 51:20.386
Why?

51:21.720 --> 51:25.303
The reason why I chose you

51:25.553 --> 51:29.302
it's because you're very patriotic.

51:29.635 --> 51:31.844
Ah, yes. But...

51:32.094 --> 51:36.427
After the war, your father died
in Jiri Mountain, right?

51:41.302 --> 51:42.302
Well, that's...

51:42.469 --> 51:44.385
He wouldn't have been a ginseng digger.

51:46.802 --> 51:51.635
With your special employment,
the background check was a bit..

51:54.178 --> 51:55.220
Actually,

51:56.970 --> 51:58.220
it was my father's business.

52:00.511 --> 52:01.927
I was too young to remember.

52:03.594 --> 52:07.677
You should work hard to vindicate.

52:08.969 --> 52:12.136
The house faces south,
so it's warm, right?

52:12.178 --> 52:13.338
- You're here.
- Loyalty, sir!

52:13.510 --> 52:15.844
Yes! Hey! You're here, too?

52:17.302 --> 52:18.302
Come on inside.

52:18.552 --> 52:21.843
Weren't you meeting the CEO?

52:21.844 --> 52:23.635
It got canceled on urgent business.

52:25.260 --> 52:26.634
Since you're here,

52:26.635 --> 52:27.844
let's have a drink.

52:28.427 --> 52:30.469
We're practically family, now.

52:32.260 --> 52:33.260
Let's go inside.

52:40.472 --> 52:42.222
Hello.

52:42.247 --> 52:43.247
Yeah.

52:51.801 --> 52:53.301
Here! Have a drink.

53:04.334 --> 53:05.958
On the rocks.

53:07.505 --> 53:08.837
Slow down.

53:10.558 --> 53:13.058
Went to army?

53:14.299 --> 53:15.465
Yes.

53:15.490 --> 53:17.867
I was in Vietnam as first sergeant.

53:18.674 --> 53:19.674
Really?

53:20.666 --> 53:23.875
I was there for a year.

53:24.393 --> 53:25.976
I was a sergeant in combat unit.

53:26.399 --> 53:29.482
Then, I got promoted as first sergeant,

53:29.507 --> 53:31.966
worked as taekwondo
instructor in the rear.

53:33.011 --> 53:35.926
This guy knows what a war is.

53:35.927 --> 53:36.927
Dependable!

53:38.898 --> 53:40.273
You have a drink, too.

53:40.677 --> 53:41.677
Yes.

53:42.427 --> 53:46.093
You were a military
judicial officer, right?

53:47.051 --> 53:48.135
Yes.

53:48.177 --> 53:49.926
I was stationed in Busan.

53:51.301 --> 53:54.258
This guy's learned about
the war from books.

53:54.259 --> 53:57.010
He's not familiar with
that intensity in war.

53:57.969 --> 54:01.260
Yes. Only those who'd
been there would know.

54:03.735 --> 54:04.527
Yeah.

54:04.747 --> 54:06.705
Give him a car!

54:07.802 --> 54:08.802
You take it!

54:15.886 --> 54:19.217
Shrapnels flew and blood was gushing out.

54:19.218 --> 54:21.051
This isn't my knee.

54:21.093 --> 54:25.425
Wow. What you do for the country,

54:25.426 --> 54:30.218
do it like then. Be fearless and feisty!

54:31.093 --> 54:36.217
People like you have to work hard

54:36.218 --> 54:41.011
so this country doesn't fall
in the hands of commies.

54:41.802 --> 54:45.011
Hey, you. Look at Vietnam.

54:45.761 --> 54:47.927
You're absolutely right.

54:49.761 --> 54:55.010
My dream was to make my son a general.

54:57.843 --> 55:00.509
So, what's the problem?

55:01.788 --> 55:03.371
He's got a bad leg.

55:04.134 --> 55:06.092
I want to get him surgery, but...

55:07.944 --> 55:09.735
It must be heartbreaking.

55:15.072 --> 55:20.447
I'll search all over this country

55:21.836 --> 55:25.293
and get you the best doctor.

55:27.677 --> 55:28.677
Mark my word.

55:30.231 --> 55:31.981
Oh, thank you.

55:32.006 --> 55:34.089
Yeah. Yeah.

55:35.468 --> 55:38.801
No need to thank me. No need.

55:39.230 --> 55:41.813
We're a family. Family!

55:42.526 --> 55:47.443
Here's to our war brothers
who went before us!

55:47.860 --> 55:48.860
Here! Here!

55:49.150 --> 55:49.733

you could at least say something...

57:35.004 --> 57:37.379
This looks expensive. It's new.

57:45.334 --> 57:46.584
Money for the undershirt.

58:48.858 --> 58:49.858
Min-guk!

58:50.342 --> 58:50.925
Huh?

58:50.950 --> 58:51.950
Get on!

59:07.959 --> 59:12.459
- Hey, It's Min-guk!
- Wow! It's Min-guk!

59:16.518 --> 59:16.852
Go on in.

59:16.877 --> 59:18.084
See you later.

59:19.910 --> 59:21.366
Min-guk, is that your dad's car?

59:21.391 --> 59:23.016
Yeah, it's my dad's car.

59:25.317 --> 59:29.525
If you ever tease Min-guk again,

59:30.233 --> 59:33.400
I'll arrest your mom and dad.

59:33.962 --> 59:34.834
Got that?

59:34.859 --> 59:35.859
Yes.

59:49.211 --> 59:51.086
Then, what did you do next?

59:53.643 --> 59:56.892
I don't know what you're talking about.

59:56.917 --> 59:59.418
How would I know what you did?

01:00:00.024 --> 01:00:01.024
What's this?

01:00:01.406 --> 01:00:02.572
Knife?

01:00:02.597 --> 01:00:05.180
Shit. It's a sickle. A sickle!

01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:07.875
Hold it. And, at the guy...
like this...

01:00:10.659 --> 01:00:12.851
- Like this...
- You kidding me?

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:15.000
Think of me as the victim. Again!

01:00:15.434 --> 01:00:16.517
What a joke.

01:00:16.659 --> 01:00:17.742
Like this.

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:19.416
You playing around?

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:20.500
Harder, you asshole!

01:00:21.459 --> 01:00:22.893
Like this.

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:24.750
Oh, no. Oh, no. What do I do?

01:00:24.775 --> 01:00:26.862
You bastard!

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.291
You did that on purpose, right?

01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:33.082
I didn't kill them all.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.791
I have to go home to my mom.

01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:40.790
I didn't kill them all, sir.

01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:42.142
You bastard.

01:00:43.082 --> 01:00:44.916
You killed them.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:47.601
All of them.

01:00:52.834 --> 01:00:54.583
<i>They'll do the surgery right away.</i>

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.267
<i>So, don't worry too much.</i>

01:00:56.292 --> 01:01:00.475
<i>By the way, I got a job for you.</i>

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.705
<i>Don't tell CHOI.</i>

01:01:03.374 --> 01:01:06.932
<i>Take care of it quietly.</i>

01:01:26.207 --> 01:01:28.294
I packed yours separately.

01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:29.625
Thank you in advance.

01:01:56.541 --> 01:01:58.416
"A TOP STAR DRUG SCANDAL"

01:02:00.541 --> 01:02:02.623
- Deputy Director SHIN?
- Yes.

01:02:02.624 --> 01:02:08.917
He continued to buy land
in Seongnam for 3 years now.

01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:11.166
With what money?

01:02:11.167 --> 01:02:14.416
He's been misusing our funds.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:16.749
With that CEO?

01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:19.291
Any proof?

01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:20.416
I'll prepare them soon.

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:23.916
Take him down for good.

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:26.956
Tightening the organization's discipline

01:02:26.957 --> 01:02:28.583
makes the country stand upright.

01:02:30.822 --> 01:02:33.947
Now! Let's play another set!

01:02:34.953 --> 01:02:36.827
My tennis skill's not improving.

01:02:52.474 --> 01:02:53.891
Thank you for your help.

01:03:04.516 --> 01:03:05.516
It's over here.

01:03:17.515 --> 01:03:19.037
Stay still.

01:03:19.181 --> 01:03:21.436
Couldn't have gone far. Search!

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.932
Have the surgery now.

01:03:29.265 --> 01:03:30.641
If not now, it'll be too late.

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:33.099
Doctor says to have the surgery now.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.933
- Once he grows, it's difficult.
- If not now, it'll be too late.

01:03:37.266 --> 01:03:38.663
Wait.

01:03:39.933 --> 01:03:42.099
Could he walk properly, then?

01:03:43.766 --> 01:03:45.724
With the surgery, he can walk for sure.

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:51.157
He might not be able to run
for being out of breath

01:03:51.182 --> 01:03:53.890
but not because his leg hurts.

01:03:54.348 --> 01:03:57.515
From now on, you have to
feed Min-guk well.

01:03:58.963 --> 01:04:00.774
Thank you, doctor.

01:04:01.265 --> 01:04:04.473
Min-guk'll be able to walk!

01:04:05.557 --> 01:04:07.354
He'll be able to walk!

01:04:19.516 --> 01:04:20.957
Sir.

01:04:25.021 --> 01:04:27.687
I was about to report to you.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:30.323
I'm sorry, sir.

01:04:30.348 --> 01:04:32.493
The report is very...

01:04:34.348 --> 01:04:35.829
thorough.

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:38.473
Now,

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:42.148
shall we finish up?

01:04:53.516 --> 01:04:54.849
And...

01:04:56.641 --> 01:04:57.801
you know reporter CHU, right?

01:04:59.015 --> 01:05:01.723
CHU Jae-jin of Freedom Daily?

01:05:04.682 --> 01:05:05.723
Yes.

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:21.152
Have you seen reporter CHU?

01:05:22.431 --> 01:05:24.154
Detective KANG.

01:05:25.812 --> 01:05:27.646
Reporter CHU...

01:05:28.723 --> 01:05:29.723
Hey!

01:05:31.015 --> 01:05:32.807
He didn't go to you, either?

01:05:42.265 --> 01:05:43.857
By any chance...

01:05:51.921 --> 01:05:54.921
Reporter CHU? Haven't seen him lately.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.379
Detective!

01:05:58.682 --> 01:06:00.472
Who? Don't know.

01:06:00.473 --> 01:06:03.265
INN

01:06:11.973 --> 01:06:14.515
Haven't seen him for days.

01:06:29.574 --> 01:06:32.532
Fuck. Where did he go?

01:06:35.923 --> 01:06:36.840
Daddy!

01:06:36.841 --> 01:06:38.773
Hey, Seong-jin!

01:06:38.798 --> 01:06:39.881
You're home early.

01:06:39.882 --> 01:06:41.297
Come quick! Have some barbecue.

01:06:43.131 --> 01:06:44.680
Come on!

01:06:57.339 --> 01:06:58.784
Sorry.

01:07:00.757 --> 01:07:02.506
This is the safest place.

01:07:03.548 --> 01:07:04.882
So, take me in for tonight.

01:07:07.298 --> 01:07:08.881
What are you going to do?

01:07:08.882 --> 01:07:11.132
Namsan blocked everything
even the foreign press.

01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:15.422
But, you know me. Don't worry too much.

01:07:16.006 --> 01:07:17.131
Worry?

01:07:17.964 --> 01:07:19.255
Who's worried about who?

01:07:21.214 --> 01:07:22.464
Stop it now. Please.

01:07:23.422 --> 01:07:24.589
It's okay, man!

01:07:25.464 --> 01:07:27.131
It's not like I'm starting a revolution.

01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:29.006
Just stop it.

01:07:30.006 --> 01:07:31.797
I know it, too. Fuck.

01:07:33.255 --> 01:07:35.714
That the whole world's rotten.

01:07:35.715 --> 01:07:39.103
That money and connections
control the world! I know!

01:07:40.715 --> 01:07:42.048
So, I have to do this.

01:07:47.339 --> 01:07:48.722
Fuck you!

01:07:49.505 --> 01:07:50.839
Who do you think you are?

01:07:52.338 --> 01:07:53.505
An ordinary person.

01:07:55.214 --> 01:07:58.582
An ordinary person wanting to live
in a time of common sense.

01:08:01.173 --> 01:08:03.714
Fuck. Who you going to shit on again?

01:08:05.547 --> 01:08:07.796
If you release it now, what
do you think will happen?

01:08:07.797 --> 01:08:08.922
Seong-jin, I know.

01:08:10.338 --> 01:08:12.354
That the world won't change right away.

01:08:12.625 --> 01:08:16.459
But, if not now, can't do it even later.

01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:19.715
You idiot!

01:08:20.798 --> 01:08:24.296
I fabricated KIM Tae-sung's case.

01:08:24.881 --> 01:08:27.006
I made it all up!

01:08:30.839 --> 01:08:32.714
As soon as you run the article,

01:08:33.756 --> 01:08:36.087
Min-guk's leg won't ever get fixed.

01:08:36.089 --> 01:08:37.880
My wife'll paste envelopes

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.131
for the rest of our lives.

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:50.421
However the world goes, I don't care.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.796
Just...

01:08:59.337 --> 01:09:02.671
let me live like now. Please.

01:09:05.671 --> 01:09:08.135
Min-guk's surgery is tomorrow.

01:09:16.546 --> 01:09:18.134
Seong-jin.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:23.174
Good night.

01:09:27.214 --> 01:09:28.505
What?

01:09:29.018 --> 01:09:30.330
Go to sleep.

01:09:33.462 --> 01:09:35.005
I know. I know.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:39.296
That he paid Min-guk's hospital
bill when I was in Vietnam.

01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:46.255
What help could I give? Go to sleep.

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.788
We have to go to the hospital early.

01:10:50.254 --> 01:10:52.921
<i>You have to take responsibility.</i>

01:10:55.345 --> 01:10:56.553
<i>You know that</i>

01:10:57.484 --> 01:10:59.817
<i>you work in the light</i>

01:11:00.311 --> 01:11:04.144
<i>and we work in the dark.</i>

01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:24.196
I found him.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280
But,

01:11:28.821 --> 01:11:31.147
please promise me one thing.

01:12:12.071 --> 01:12:13.904
I'm getting surgery, today?

01:12:15.071 --> 01:12:16.446
What about school?

01:12:18.113 --> 01:12:19.195
Let's go.

01:12:20.778 --> 01:12:21.988
Come on!

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:34.530
- Parents, please wait here.
- Is it a DDH patient?

01:12:34.572 --> 01:12:36.280
Yes. O.R. #3.

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:50.487
This is KIM Tae-sung's crime
reenactment schedule.

01:12:50.488 --> 01:12:52.862
- Have a look.
- Yes.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.404
By the way, sir...

01:12:58.154 --> 01:13:00.695
please keep your promise.

01:13:07.071 --> 01:13:10.113
Please just let him out intact.

01:13:10.488 --> 01:13:11.988
It's not up to me,

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.904
but up to Mr. CHU.

01:13:14.946 --> 01:13:19.405
Well, he's very stubborn.

01:13:19.988 --> 01:13:23.321
Oh, right! Our Min-guk!

01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:26.428
Did the surgery go well?

01:14:04.237 --> 01:14:06.279
Fuck.

01:14:08.571 --> 01:14:11.112
<i>The Gov. will complete
the public park project</i>

01:14:11.154 --> 01:14:14.987
<i>by focusing on local
administrative efforts.</i>

01:14:16.028 --> 01:14:17.444
<i>Next, breaking news.</i>

01:14:17.445 --> 01:14:21.694
<i>SHIN Yong-su, the Director
of the Intelligence Agency,</i>

01:14:21.695 --> 01:14:23.695
<i>was arrested on suspicion of bribery.</i>

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.237
<i>SHIN is suspected of taking
bribes and political funds</i>

01:14:28.238 --> 01:14:31.113
<i>from CEO of Jangsan.</i>

01:14:31.446 --> 01:14:32.904
<i>SHIN has...</i>

01:14:34.195 --> 01:14:36.487
CHU Jae-jin.

01:14:39.067 --> 01:14:43.276
Seoul Nat'I Univ. Law Dept.
Enrolled in '62.

01:14:46.111 --> 01:14:48.821
We went to the same school.

01:14:49.503 --> 01:14:50.961
Seoul Nat'I University.

01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:53.269
Law Dept.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.413
Enrolled in '70.

01:14:57.028 --> 01:14:58.445
While in school,

01:14:58.903 --> 01:15:00.320
passed the bar exam.

01:15:02.404 --> 01:15:04.236
The youngest prosecutor.

01:15:04.237 --> 01:15:07.903
Noticed by KIM II-gyun in army.

01:15:08.862 --> 01:15:10.903
Transferred to Intelligence Agency.

01:15:11.362 --> 01:15:16.653

01:15:17.487 --> 01:15:20.237
Division Head, CHOI Gyu-nam.

01:15:21.362 --> 01:15:25.112
Why, you had a lot of interest in me, too.

01:15:26.112 --> 01:15:31.112
You sure are a competent
reporter of Freedom Daily. Sir.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:33.112
You're too kind.

01:15:33.855 --> 01:15:34.855
Sir.

01:15:36.463 --> 01:15:37.463
Sir.

01:15:40.426 --> 01:15:42.634
Please stop suffering.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.573
Your materials.

01:15:46.926 --> 01:15:49.471
Please give me the materials, now!

01:15:51.778 --> 01:15:52.778
Sir.

01:16:12.304 --> 01:16:13.304
Sir.

01:16:14.546 --> 01:16:17.420
As of now,

01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:22.597
the law will be enforced.

01:16:29.445 --> 01:16:30.903
Since when was it?

01:16:33.145 --> 01:16:36.020
From the North

01:16:36.645 --> 01:16:38.395
that you got the order...

01:16:39.771 --> 01:16:41.120
Geez.

01:16:42.062 --> 01:16:44.228
Couldn't you get me something more fancy?

01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:47.263
Espionage is... shitty...

01:17:08.745 --> 01:17:10.412
What are you doing?

01:17:10.437 --> 01:17:12.752
We have to start from the top.

01:17:15.853 --> 01:17:17.834
Ah, wait!

01:17:21.687 --> 01:17:22.687
Sir.

01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:32.061
Then, please continue to suffer.

01:17:37.842 --> 01:17:40.008
If I don't fall,

01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:43.548
nobody can knock me down.

01:17:44.852 --> 01:17:46.811
If I don't fall,

01:17:47.353 --> 01:17:49.604
nobody can knock me down.

01:17:51.228 --> 01:17:53.395
If I don't fall,

01:17:53.853 --> 01:17:56.894
nobody can knock me down.

01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:06.686
Who cares.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.753
- Min-guk!
- Daddy!

01:18:16.019 --> 01:18:17.811
- Here!
- What is it?

01:18:18.433 --> 01:18:20.892
Can I wear this to the sports day?

01:18:21.478 --> 01:18:23.852
Sure! Eat up.

01:18:25.102 --> 01:18:26.269
By the way...

01:18:28.217 --> 01:18:30.176
Look for a house.

01:18:30.988 --> 01:18:32.280
A two-story house.

01:18:43.975 --> 01:18:45.391
Jae-jin.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:55.394
Start cleaning there. Yeah. Hey, up there!

01:18:56.144 --> 01:18:59.227
Seong-jin. Let's go. Come!

01:18:59.478 --> 01:19:01.436
Come out quickly!

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:05.187
Seong-jin, let's go!

01:19:06.518 --> 01:19:07.101
What is it?

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:08.185
Just come.

01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:12.244
Hello, sir.

01:19:12.269 --> 01:19:13.852
Eat up!

01:19:15.102 --> 01:19:18.186
Nothing beats this for your health. Right?

01:19:22.019 --> 01:19:25.269
- What is this?
- You know.

01:19:25.436 --> 01:19:27.686
That white dog we had out front.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.106
Who stands guard...

01:20:02.034 --> 01:20:05.893
Then, who stands guard in the front yard?

01:20:05.935 --> 01:20:06.935
It's hot!

01:20:07.144 --> 01:20:08.893
Hey! KANG Seong-jin!

01:20:08.894 --> 01:20:10.602
I've had enough of you asshole!

01:20:10.603 --> 01:20:13.267
You asshole. Let go. Shit.

01:20:13.268 --> 01:20:15.392
Let go! You asshole.

01:20:15.393 --> 01:20:16.601
KANG Seong-jin!

01:20:16.602 --> 01:20:19.309
Since you went to Namsan,
got nothing to fear?

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:22.086
Have you gone mad? You jerk.

01:20:25.643 --> 01:20:26.518
Hello.

01:20:26.519 --> 01:20:28.727
Detective Unit.

01:20:29.893 --> 01:20:32.269
Who did you say? Please hold.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:34.569
Detective KANG!

01:20:35.694 --> 01:20:36.903
Detective KANG!

01:20:37.694 --> 01:20:39.111
You got a call.

01:20:39.611 --> 01:20:41.569
It's from the hospital.

01:20:57.652 --> 01:20:58.985
Sir...

01:21:00.526 --> 01:21:03.735
Get up. It's too cold here...

01:21:26.777 --> 01:21:29.401
Excuse me for taking your picture.

01:22:09.234 --> 01:22:13.596
They say he accidentally fell
on the Mountain.

01:22:17.334 --> 01:22:21.458
But how could the back of
his head cave in like that?

01:22:23.818 --> 01:22:29.109
Jae-jin, please wake up...

01:22:32.734 --> 01:22:37.360
Hey! What happened to living a long life?

01:22:38.477 --> 01:22:42.435
Those damn bastards!

01:23:32.625 --> 01:23:36.457
This won't help you.

01:23:38.018 --> 01:23:40.934
Please leave. Think of Min-guk.

01:23:41.358 --> 01:23:42.400
Now!

01:23:51.723 --> 01:23:55.515
CHU Jae-jin was kind-hearted.

01:23:57.027 --> 01:23:59.484
Like a mutt,

01:23:59.485 --> 01:24:02.027
how dare you get on people's dining table?

01:24:02.181 --> 01:24:05.318
You never saw humans as humans, right?

01:24:05.521 --> 01:24:07.813
Look, Mr. KANG.

01:24:08.768 --> 01:24:11.976
You bark when I tell you to.

01:24:12.535 --> 01:24:16.410
You bite when I tell you to.

01:24:16.989 --> 01:24:19.697
Then, I'll make your stomach full.

01:24:25.492 --> 01:24:28.034
I'll go on top of your dining table.

01:24:29.301 --> 01:24:32.352
And bark out loud for you.

01:24:45.609 --> 01:24:46.609
Eat it.

01:24:58.317 --> 01:24:59.400
Eat it.

01:25:35.673 --> 01:25:40.382
You'll just pay for your crime.

01:25:41.832 --> 01:25:42.832
Got that?

01:25:45.326 --> 01:25:46.450
What?

01:25:48.492 --> 01:25:51.991
Detective, I did everything.

01:25:55.616 --> 01:25:59.909
Just for your crime. Only that.

01:26:02.117 --> 01:26:05.201
And, I'll pay for my crimes.

01:26:06.492 --> 01:26:07.575
What?

01:26:44.742 --> 01:26:46.450
Finish eating it.

01:26:47.409 --> 01:26:48.909
And...

01:26:53.867 --> 01:26:55.700
I'm sorry.

01:26:59.741 --> 01:27:02.241
It... It's all right.

01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:10.824
Every... Everything'll be fine.

01:27:47.449 --> 01:27:50.033
SEONG-JIN, EVERYTHING'LL BE FINE.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.946
Let's have a press conference.

01:28:31.491 --> 01:28:33.449
With only these documents...

01:28:34.408 --> 01:28:38.491
Well, I... I'll testify.

01:28:40.597 --> 01:28:43.181
What testimony will you give?

01:28:46.116 --> 01:28:47.116
I'm...

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.025
I'm the accomplice.

01:28:52.449 --> 01:28:56.033
To Jae-jin's death by torture case.

01:28:58.043 --> 01:29:00.188
Accomplice?

01:29:07.532 --> 01:29:09.408
Don't worry about your family.

01:29:10.084 --> 01:29:13.750
We'll safely take them to Osaka.

01:29:16.823 --> 01:29:18.935
Thank you in advance.

01:29:19.907 --> 01:29:21.572
My kid still has a cast.

01:29:21.573 --> 01:29:25.783
Yeah. Don't you worry.

01:29:43.832 --> 01:29:44.832
Tomorrow,

01:29:45.634 --> 01:29:46.969
my colleague will come

01:29:46.993 --> 01:29:50.535
and take you to Osaka in Japan.

01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:55.440
I'll take the next train soon.

01:30:00.274 --> 01:30:02.065
I'll tell you everything later.

01:30:02.232 --> 01:30:03.232
Who am I?

01:30:03.357 --> 01:30:04.357
I'm KANG Seong-jin.

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.419
Don't worry too much.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:10.487
I said don't worry!

01:30:37.546 --> 01:30:39.087
Take good care of Min-guk.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.691
Pretty.

01:30:57.484 --> 01:30:58.900
Everything'll be fine.

01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:42.190
Honey.

01:31:43.566 --> 01:31:45.107
Min-guk. Min-guk.

01:31:54.315 --> 01:31:56.690
Min-guk. Min-guk.

01:32:41.805 --> 01:32:43.847
Are you all right?

01:32:46.824 --> 01:32:47.957
Did you check BP?

01:32:50.211 --> 01:32:51.585
The pulse dropping.

01:32:51.648 --> 01:32:52.325
Help me here.

01:32:52.424 --> 01:32:55.787
- Charge 150. Clear.
- Shock.

01:33:55.267 --> 01:33:56.434
Finish it clean.

01:34:02.981 --> 01:34:08.606
- Since when?
- Namsan's everywhere.

01:34:14.551 --> 01:34:18.008
I liked you, sir.

01:34:19.227 --> 01:34:21.269
You reminded me of my older brother.

01:34:21.962 --> 01:34:24.170
My brother who... died in Vietnam.

01:34:25.121 --> 01:34:27.746
Stop talking nonsense, you asshole.

01:34:31.476 --> 01:34:33.642
That's why I recommended you.

01:34:34.467 --> 01:34:35.705
That's terrific.

01:34:35.995 --> 01:34:37.371
I'm sorry.

01:34:38.582 --> 01:34:41.749
I didn't think it'd come to this.
I just...

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:51.025
They'll build a dam here.

01:34:52.201 --> 01:34:53.493
'The Peace Dam'.

01:35:12.766 --> 01:35:15.016
When dark feelings fill the gut,

01:35:16.017 --> 01:35:17.810
you told me to let it out with a smoke.

01:35:19.725 --> 01:35:23.725
Excuse me, but I'll have a smoke.

01:35:32.743 --> 01:35:35.951
I'll have just one.

01:36:38.305 --> 01:36:40.680
SEONG-JIN, EVERYTHING'LL BE FINE.

01:36:44.708 --> 01:36:46.291
Is it true the witness will come?

01:36:46.316 --> 01:36:47.357
Please tell us.

01:36:48.336 --> 01:36:52.336
Ah, yes. Please wait a bit.
He's on his way.

01:36:52.933 --> 01:36:54.267
If you wait a bit,

01:36:55.397 --> 01:36:57.688
you'll witness the true nature of
the government.

01:36:57.689 --> 01:36:59.898
Dirty and heinous fabrication.

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:01.481
Come on!

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.563
The gov. is announcing the
defense of the Constitution.

01:37:03.564 --> 01:37:04.564
Come quick!

01:37:04.606 --> 01:37:06.687
No. He's on his way.

01:37:06.688 --> 01:37:07.688
Please wait.

01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:13.313
<i>In consideration of everything,</i>

01:37:13.938 --> 01:37:17.396
<i>I must make an important decision.</i>

01:37:18.730 --> 01:37:21.605
<i>During my presidency,</i>

01:37:22.271 --> 01:37:25.022
<i>I find that a constitutional
reform is impossible.</i>

01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:27.521
<i>Thus, according to the Constitution,</i>

01:37:28.022 --> 01:37:33.187
<i>when my presidency expires in next year,</i>

01:37:33.188 --> 01:37:37.898
<i>I affirm to transfer the government
to my successor.</i>

01:37:44.105 --> 01:37:45.187
Hello.

01:37:45.188 --> 01:37:46.188
<i>It's me.</i>

01:37:47.605 --> 01:37:51.188
<i>You're the only one who can help me.</i>

01:39:02.802 --> 01:39:04.094
Congratulations!

01:39:08.688 --> 01:39:10.812
The President's defense of the Constitution

01:39:10.813 --> 01:39:12.205
and your promotion to Deputy Director.

01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:14.271
It's a double celebration.

01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:16.521
Congratulations!

01:39:18.064 --> 01:39:20.521
Must call you Deputy Director CHOI!

01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:22.812
With principle and

01:39:24.063 --> 01:39:25.562
with conviction,

01:39:26.896 --> 01:39:28.104
I will work

01:39:31.687 --> 01:39:33.187
without causing trouble.

01:39:33.228 --> 01:39:36.354
Let's make a toast!
To Deputy Director CHOI!

01:39:36.646 --> 01:39:37.813
Cheers!

01:39:38.188 --> 01:39:39.313
Thank you.

01:39:41.438 --> 01:39:42.438
Have some snack.

01:39:43.813 --> 01:39:45.396
Huh? What's this?

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.730
CHOI Gyu-nam.

01:40:03.479 --> 01:40:06.104
I told you I'd come up and bark.

01:40:10.416 --> 01:40:12.249
Hey, you fuckin' mutt.

01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:15.161
Can you take it?

01:40:16.187 --> 01:40:20.938
You painfully made your way to the table

01:40:21.558 --> 01:40:25.599
but you know the ending's obvious.

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.145
Look, KANG Seong-jin.

01:40:36.772 --> 01:40:41.730
CHU Jae-jin and your family are all dead

01:40:44.428 --> 01:40:47.137
because of the choice you made.

01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:12.247
All right.

01:41:13.765 --> 01:41:15.348
My last choice.

01:41:18.825 --> 01:41:22.783
Do you think I can shoot or not?

01:41:27.369 --> 01:41:28.660
No.

01:41:31.974 --> 01:41:35.974
Do you think I can bite or not?

01:41:38.779 --> 01:41:40.905
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

01:41:47.652 --> 01:41:49.361
Name. CHOI Gyu-nam.

01:41:50.371 --> 01:41:52.871
Born November 25, 1951.

01:41:53.083 --> 01:41:55.208
Resident of 23, Jongno-gu.

01:41:55.635 --> 01:41:58.302
First Deputy Director of
Intelligence Agency.

01:41:59.336 --> 01:42:00.543
Is that right?

01:42:01.812 --> 01:42:03.104
Is it true...

01:42:04.814 --> 01:42:07.147
that you ordered reporter
CHU's death by torture?

01:42:08.669 --> 01:42:09.794
Who are they?

01:42:09.819 --> 01:42:10.861
Who are you guys?

01:42:11.478 --> 01:42:12.811
Out of my way.

01:42:16.144 --> 01:42:17.144
Seize the film.

01:42:17.328 --> 01:42:18.328
Beat them up!

01:42:18.657 --> 01:42:19.782
Drop the camera!

01:42:22.312 --> 01:42:23.312
Give it back!

01:42:30.242 --> 01:42:31.242
And...

01:42:46.584 --> 01:42:48.001
Hey! CHOI Gyu-nam!

01:42:48.373 --> 01:42:50.290
Investigation's not over.

01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:53.703
CHU Jae-jin. Solicitation of murder.

01:42:53.728 --> 01:42:57.185
And my wife, SONG Jeong-suk.

01:42:57.186 --> 01:43:00.353
My son, KANG Min-guk.

01:43:00.587 --> 01:43:05.421
You're arrested for solicitation of murder!

01:43:15.707 --> 01:43:17.666
Chief Editor!

01:43:21.561 --> 01:43:22.686
What happened to you?

01:43:23.227 --> 01:43:25.603
Are you all right?

01:43:26.483 --> 01:43:27.234
Are you all right?

01:43:27.259 --> 01:43:29.009
What happened to you?

01:43:32.017 --> 01:43:33.267
The photos?

01:43:35.806 --> 01:43:38.223
I'll kill you if you don't have it.

01:43:50.579 --> 01:43:52.122
- Chief Editor.
- Chief Editor.

01:43:58.295 --> 01:44:00.419
Put CHU's photo on the front page.

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:01.586
Run the press!

01:44:01.919 --> 01:44:03.003
Yes, sir!

01:44:03.045 --> 01:44:05.295
Let's do it! Come on quickly!

01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:21.336
REPORTER DEAD FROM TORTURE

01:44:24.254 --> 01:44:27.336
This won't kill me.

01:44:28.544 --> 01:44:32.336
I have nine lives!

01:45:06.128 --> 01:45:10.420
When the social mood is the worst than ever

01:45:12.295 --> 01:45:15.794
you made a fatal mistake.

01:45:17.128 --> 01:45:19.919
There will be no more mistakes.

01:45:35.127 --> 01:45:37.377
We appreciated your hard work.

01:45:51.753 --> 01:45:53.669
Put out your cigarette.

01:45:56.794 --> 01:45:57.794
What?

01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:02.211
Put it out.

01:46:16.127 --> 01:46:21.002
I'm doing it not because of you
but because I have to stop it.

01:46:21.835 --> 01:46:23.710
I just do as I'm told.

01:46:24.348 --> 01:46:26.599
But, people today aren't stupid.

01:46:29.378 --> 01:46:30.544
Don't you know?

01:46:31.128 --> 01:46:34.211
In here, principle and conviction.

01:46:34.253 --> 01:46:36.586
That's all it takes.

01:46:39.086 --> 01:46:41.668
Wow, you're driving me mad. Really.

01:46:43.335 --> 01:46:47.584
Sir, the situation's bad due to
the defense of Constitution.

01:46:47.585 --> 01:46:51.002
But this CHU case
just poured oil onto fire.

01:46:51.259 --> 01:46:54.842
It's about to blow up outside!

01:47:00.668 --> 01:47:04.960
Don't you know who I am?

01:47:07.085 --> 01:47:12.170
So, threatening an incumbent
prosecutor, right?

01:47:15.003 --> 01:47:16.918
Look, Mr. CHOI Gyu-nam.

01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:21.325
Don't you know Namsan's not saving
you because they like you?

01:47:23.252 --> 01:47:25.084
Plus, if the Big Boss changes,

01:47:25.085 --> 01:47:26.585
who knows what'll happen?

01:47:28.178 --> 01:47:29.886
Don't kid yourself.

01:47:30.585 --> 01:47:34.002
The world's never once changed.

01:47:35.933 --> 01:47:37.013
GOVERNMENT TRANSFER

01:47:37.037 --> 01:47:39.973
It's just made to look that way.

01:47:42.085 --> 01:47:43.126
AFFIDAVIT

01:47:43.127 --> 01:47:46.001
Let's just finish it clean.

01:47:46.002 --> 01:47:48.711
You were the last person
to see CHU Jae-jin.

01:47:49.233 --> 01:47:50.733
At your house.

01:47:50.837 --> 01:47:52.879
It was CHOI Gyu-nam who did it.

01:47:58.862 --> 01:48:00.154
Why did you kill your wife?

01:48:11.743 --> 01:48:13.201
You bastard.

01:48:13.202 --> 01:48:14.619
Enough. That's enough.

01:48:14.661 --> 01:48:15.661
Yes sir.

01:49:27.619 --> 01:49:30.160
Meet up with the family later.

01:49:31.201 --> 01:49:32.992
If you concede the charges,
you get 15 years.

01:49:33.409 --> 01:49:36.992
If not, you'll be in heaven
without seeing your son.

01:49:37.034 --> 01:49:38.368
What sounds better?

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:43.284
<i>It ends fast if you stay still.</i>

01:50:24.326 --> 01:50:27.700
<i>Intelligence Agency urgently
arrested a police officer</i>

01:50:27.701 --> 01:50:30.116
<i>who was a spy infiltrated
in the police force.</i>

01:50:30.117 --> 01:50:32.000
<i>The arrested officer, Det. KANG,</i>

01:50:32.101 --> 01:50:33.788
Who believes that?

01:50:34.586 --> 01:50:35.779
Crazy bastards.

01:50:35.804 --> 01:50:38.466
<i>was reported that he
trained with a North Korean.</i>

01:50:38.992 --> 01:50:40.908
<i>KANG was a resident spy</i>

01:50:40.909 --> 01:50:43.533
<i>disguised for the last 10 years.</i>

01:50:43.534 --> 01:50:46.617
<i>He killed Freedom Daily's
reporter CHU over an argument.</i>

01:50:46.618 --> 01:50:49.117
<i>He fabricated the case...</i>

01:50:49.368 --> 01:50:51.618
Bastards.

01:50:51.743 --> 01:50:53.618
Now what?

01:50:54.243 --> 01:50:57.117
This sucks.

01:50:57.451 --> 01:51:00.201
<i>...said he confessed to killing.</i>

01:51:00.534 --> 01:51:01.701
<i>Next news.</i>

01:51:03.243 --> 01:51:04.409
What's going on?

01:51:11.701 --> 01:51:16.368
<i>...framed Intelligence Agency
for the murder.</i>

01:51:16.701 --> 01:51:19.325
<i>Also, he killed his wife
whom tried to notify this,</i>

01:51:19.326 --> 01:51:22.618
<i>by carbon monoxide poisoning.</i>

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:24.409
<i>I repeat.</i>

01:51:24.451 --> 01:51:27.200
<i>Intelligence Agency urgently
arrested the police officer</i>

01:51:27.201 --> 01:51:29.784

Thank you.

01:52:07.909 --> 01:52:10.075
DECLARATION OF STATE OF AFFAIRS

We, professors, note that

the people's desire for democracy

01:52:16.051 --> 01:52:17.635
was slaughtered with weapons

01:54:25.667 --> 01:54:27.708
Down with dictatorship!

01:54:28.208 --> 01:55:05.625
Reform Constitution!
Down with dictatorship!

01:55:09.641 --> 01:55:13.265
<i>On that day, ordinary people
took on the great challenge.</i>

01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:16.791
