32:43.057 --> 32:45.690
I like to find things
that really aren't a problem

32:45.789 --> 32:48.125
to see how the owner
responds to the curve balls.

32:48.224 --> 32:50.058
But you really stood up to me,

32:50.159 --> 32:51.996
showing you really knew your stuff.

32:52.914 --> 32:55.193
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow, then.

32:55.295 --> 32:57.697
- For another inspection?
- No, I'm bringing

32:57.797 --> 33:00.597
some friends here for lunch.
The food looks fantastic.

33:00.699 --> 33:04.008
I'll make you something special.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.081
I thought you might
like to know your chocolates

33:13.183 --> 33:15.462
- are working again.
- What do you mean?

33:15.463 --> 33:17.993
Well, I was so nervous
when I found out I was being

33:18.018 --> 33:20.983
inspected again, but I took
a moment, I ate a chocolate

33:21.008 --> 33:23.623
and I decided to stay strong
like you told me.

33:23.723 --> 33:26.244
And things turned out even
better than you said they would.

33:26.346 --> 33:28.936
So... I helped you?

33:29.630 --> 33:32.324
Yeah, I guess you did.

33:33.091 --> 33:35.598
Anyway, now you have
a customer for life!

33:37.156 --> 33:38.991
Oh, Abigail,

33:39.091 --> 33:41.126
I'm glad you're here. My mother-in-law

33:41.226 --> 33:44.260
got in last night and I left her
a little something

33:44.360 --> 33:46.462
I bought at your store
but she called this morning

33:46.562 --> 33:48.996
and left me a message about...

33:49.097 --> 33:51.417
Could you just listen to it,
and maybe tell me what to say?

33:51.497 --> 33:53.365
It's only a few minutes long.

33:53.466 --> 33:57.140
Oh, a few minutes? I really
have to get to my store.

33:57.242 --> 33:59.402
Okay. Then I'll stop by

33:59.503 --> 34:02.071
later this morning
and play it for you then.

34:02.171 --> 34:04.072
If there aren't too many other people

34:04.172 --> 34:06.140
trying to get your attention.

34:11.076 --> 34:14.043
Hey, do you wanna go
to the Bistro after school?

34:14.145 --> 34:16.045
Yeah, I need to study anyway, so...

34:16.145 --> 34:18.045
- And I need a coffee break.
- Hey.

34:18.147 --> 34:19.915
Hey.

34:20.835 --> 34:24.385
Uh, how far is school? My dad
signed me up to start on Monday,

34:24.484 --> 34:27.385
and I want to pick up my books
before the first day.

34:27.487 --> 34:29.388
Then maybe I can transfer before then.

34:29.487 --> 34:32.889
- Nick...
- Listen, Nick...

34:32.991 --> 34:34.925
- I'll see you at school.
- Sure.

34:38.926 --> 34:41.384
Yeah, he's gonna need some time

34:41.409 --> 34:42.895
getting used to you being here.

34:42.996 --> 34:44.897
- I get it.
- I'm not sure

34:44.998 --> 34:48.510
- I'd forgive me if I was him.
- Yeah, why did you

34:48.547 --> 34:51.105
just leave him like that
at the beach house?

34:51.205 --> 34:52.500
I don't know.

34:52.992 --> 34:56.203
I'd never done anything
like that before, or since.

34:57.121 --> 34:59.215
And my dad's so mad at me, I...
He probably won't let me

34:59.239 --> 35:01.709
out of the house again
to give me the chance.

35:02.109 --> 35:05.141
Yeah, I heard him kind of
yelling at you last night.

35:05.243 --> 35:07.143
He found us a place to live,

35:07.243 --> 35:09.592
so things should be getting
quieter for you pretty soon.

35:11.145 --> 35:14.114
You know, I'm not sure Nick's
mad at you so much...

35:14.597 --> 35:16.015
- He should be.
- No, I think

35:16.116 --> 35:18.417
he's just jealous, in that you got

35:18.516 --> 35:20.880
to stay in New York
and he had to move here.

35:20.981 --> 35:23.152
Doesn't he like it here?

35:23.252 --> 35:26.153
Yeah, mostly...

35:26.255 --> 35:27.976
But he had to leave all of his friends

35:28.001 --> 35:31.072
and move away from his mom. It's hard.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.458
I should be the jealous one.

35:33.558 --> 35:35.593
Jealous of Nick? Why?

35:36.786 --> 35:38.995
Because he gets to live
next door to you.
