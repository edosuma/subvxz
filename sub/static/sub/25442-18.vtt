with your moms

08:28.920 --> 08:31.210
and put on your blindfolds,
we can begin.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.460
Nia (whispers):
Mom!

08:34.460 --> 08:36.880
This is my chance
to impress the councilwoman.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.210
If we nail these exercises,

08:38.210 --> 08:40.210
she'll pick me for
Neighborhood Youth Council.

08:40.210 --> 08:42.290
You ready? Mom?

08:42.290 --> 08:43.500
Blindfold on.
Blindfold on.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
Get ready to go.
Let's go.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.170
Now Young Leaders,

08:47.170 --> 08:49.330
you must trust your
chaperones to guide you

08:49.330 --> 08:51.290
through this crowded space.

08:51.290 --> 08:54.210
The journey is its own reward.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.330
Hey, Mom, slow down.
Let's enjoy the journey.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.500
Oh, trust your mama,
sweetheart.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.250
I know exactly where
this journey's gonna end.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.920
Now, I got a light touch.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.040
It might be so light,

09:03.040 --> 09:04.580
you might not even
feel it. Right?

09:04.580 --> 09:06.080
-It's so light.
Keep walking.
-Okay.

09:06.080 --> 09:06.960
Keep walking, sweetheart.

09:08.710 --> 09:09.790
Hello!

09:09.790 --> 09:12.380
How are you?
I'm Raven from
the Ravenous line.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.330
Wow! Mom, you do
have a light touch.

09:14.330 --> 09:16.580
It's almost like you're
not touching me at all.

09:16.580 --> 09:19.000
Listen, I just really want
to show you my designs.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.830
Normally, I'd be
so happy to see them,

09:20.830 --> 09:22.250
but right now,
I'm focused on my daughter.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.380
Yes! Yes!
Me too. Me too!

09:24.380 --> 09:25.750
Look at yours.
She's so cute.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.120
Hi! Hello.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.960
Hey, uh, are we-- are we close
to the councilwoman?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.420
Isn't that your daughter?

09:31.420 --> 09:33.880
It looks like she's about
to walk into those chairs.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.170
You know, I just like to let her
find her own way in the world.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.290
I'll be right back.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.580
(whispers):
Ni Ni! Nia!

09:39.580 --> 09:42.040
-(both yelp)
-(clattering)

09:42.040 --> 09:44.290
(strained):
I hope the councilwoman
didn't see that.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.620
Oh! No, no, no, shh!
Trust your mama.
She didn't see it.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.790
She didn't see it. Shh!

09:51.960 --> 09:53.620
♪ ♪

09:53.620 --> 09:55.210
For our next exercise,

09:55.210 --> 09:57.830
we'll be listening
to the leader inside
of ourselves.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.290
I want you to close your eyes,

10:00.290 --> 10:02.830
remain silent,
and let the energy flow

10:02.830 --> 10:05.500
by putting yourself
into lotus position.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.710
(sighs)

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
(grunts)

10:16.500 --> 10:18.330
Okay.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.960
(whimpering)

10:29.920 --> 10:32.620
(whispering): You okay?
Okay, here we go.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.500
Come on. Okay.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.790
-Just...
-Okay. Yes. All right.

10:36.790 --> 10:38.750
-Ready? Okay.
-Uh-huh.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.380
-No! No! No!
-Mom!

10:43.920 --> 10:45.540
Okay, sorry.
Oh, no!

10:47.170 --> 10:48.210
Mom, shh!

10:50.210 --> 10:51.880
-Are you good?
-Just sit down,
just sit down.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.960
(whooshing)

11:03.000 --> 11:04.960
(echoing):
Impressive design, Raven.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.000
(whooshing)

11:08.080 --> 11:11.040
(gasps, whispers):
I gotta make a call.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.380
I gotta go home.

11:15.710 --> 11:18.420
I lotus-ed myself in,
I can't lotus myself out.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.210
Okay.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.620
You got this, Raven.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.080
Any sign of Jamie and Amber?

11:33.080 --> 11:36.250
-Not yet.
-I thought you boys were
taking the dog out for a walk.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.250
We are.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.460
-Here they come.
-Right now!

11:39.540 --> 11:41.580
Oh, hey, ladies!
(chuckling)

11:41.580 --> 11:43.170
Funny running into you here.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.080
Yeah. What are the odds?

11:45.080 --> 11:46.920
And, uh, look
who else is here.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.330
Mr. Manchego!

11:48.330 --> 11:50.540
We're watching him
for the weekend.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.250
You know, just two dudes
and a dog.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.790
Yep, but it could be

11:54.790 --> 11:56.920
two girls, two dudes
and a dog

11:56.920 --> 11:58.580
going for a walk
in the park.

11:58.580 --> 12:00.880
Yeah, that sounds fun.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.080
Except it doesn't look
like he needs a walk

12:03.080 --> 12:05.500
because he's peeing
on your foot.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.830
Oh!

12:06.830 --> 12:08.920
Well, that just means
he loves me!

12:08.920 --> 12:12.290
But, um, we're gonna
have to take that walk
some other time,

12:12.290 --> 12:15.420
'cause I gotta go wring
the love out of my sock.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.540
Ladies.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.290
(chuckling)

12:23.500 --> 12:25.790
Well, that didn't work,
at all.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.620
There has got to be
an easier

12:27.620 --> 12:30.170
and drier way to get the girls
to pay attention to us.

12:30.170 --> 12:32.830
(barking)

12:32.830 --> 12:35.290
-What's he barking at?
-Looks like you.

12:35.290 --> 12:37.460
(barking)

12:37.460 --> 12:39.080
What's going on here?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.460
What's with all the barking?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.790
-(squishing)
-And the sloshing.

12:42.790 --> 12:45.620
(cell phone):
Raven's calling!
Raven's calling!

12:45.620 --> 12:47.620
(chuckles)
I made that.
Cute, huh?

12:47.620 --> 12:48.960
(barks)

12:48.960 --> 12:52.080
I can't hear anything in here.
I'm gonna take it in the hall.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.120
(barking)

12:54.120 --> 12:56.500
We don't know
what you want, boy!

12:56.500 --> 12:57.830
(barking)

12:57.830 --> 13:01.000
Well, at least we know
he doesn't need to go out.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.500
What do we do?

13:02.500 --> 13:06.040
(whines)
I need a thinking cookie!

13:06.040 --> 13:07.920
(dog barking)

13:07.920 --> 13:10.000
(groans)
It's a dog treat!

13:10.000 --> 13:10.920

-(growling)

13:17.580 --> 13:19.210

13:20.710 --> 13:21.830
-(grunting)
-(fabric rips)

13:24.040 --> 13:25.750
Well, he gave it to you.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.460
Hey, at least
he's not peeing.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.040
-(trickling)
-Oh, he is!

13:32.040 --> 13:35.040
And then, at 10:43,
Levi asked for
a bag of chips.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.880
-Sebastian.
-Oh, and a string cheese.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.040
-Sebastian.
-Oh, FYI, we're out
of string cheese.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.380
(screams):
Sebastian!

13:40.380 --> 13:42.750
(quietly):
Listen, Shinée Dubois
is here at the retreat,

13:42.750 --> 13:44.210
and I really wanna
show her my design,

13:44.210 --> 13:46.080
so please just send
a picture of it ASAP!

13:46.080 --> 13:47.210
(clears throat)

13:51.540 --> 13:54.880
My inner voice told me
that there was an
emergency at home,

13:54.880 --> 13:56.580
and there was.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.540
Om...

14:01.380 --> 14:02.500
Booker!

14:02.500 --> 14:04.460
I have to take a picture
of your mother's design.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.710
Right now!
Open the door!

14:09.580 --> 14:11.210
(chuckling nervously)

14:11.210 --> 14:13.960
Hey! There's our new
favorite shiny guy.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.170
Open the door.

14:17.170 --> 14:18.830
Okay, Sebastian, look.

14:18.830 --> 14:20.620
-We can let you in...
-Uh-huh.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.420
...but you gotta promise
not to freak out.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.330
(laughing)
Why would I freak out?

14:26.040 --> 14:27.620
No real reason!

14:33.830 --> 14:36.420
(screaming)

14:36.420 --> 14:37.750
What did you two do?!

14:37.750 --> 14:40.750
I promised your mom
I'd keep one thing safe!

14:40.750 --> 14:42.380
One thing!

14:42.380 --> 14:45.210
(crying)
And I blew it!

14:45.210 --> 14:48.120
(crying)

14:48.120 --> 14:50.420
At least she's cool
about the dog.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.290
She's not cool about the dog?

14:54.290 --> 14:56.460
(sobbing loudly)

14:58.290 --> 15:00.960
Come on, Sebastian.
Send the picture.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.620
Our final exercise will
involve public speaking.

15:04.620 --> 15:07.330
Each of our young leaders
has prepared a speech

15:07.330 --> 15:08.670
they will deliver to the group.

15:08.670 --> 15:12.330
This is my last chance
to impress the councilwoman.

15:12.330 --> 15:15.460
So, Mom, please, please,
stay focused.

15:15.460 --> 15:16.830
(laughing):
Focused.

15:16.830 --> 15:21.500
Nia, didn't you learn anything
from the trust exercise?

15:23.880 --> 15:25.710
Look, I know you
wanna talk to Shinée,

15:25.710 --> 15:28.040
so just please do it now
before the speeches start.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.880
-Really?
-Really.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.790
-You got two minutes.
-Thank you.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.620
I'm a little nervous.
I'm gonna go get some water.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.120
Okay, thank you.
Shinée!

15:36.120 --> 15:38.670
Hello! I have two minutes
to show you my design.

15:38.670 --> 15:41.210
Well, who said I do?

15:41.210 --> 15:43.040
Oh, okay, fine.
Show it to me.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.250
Okay, perfect!

15:44.250 --> 15:46.170
Um, I would love to, but
I don't have a picture of it,

15:46.170 --> 15:48.330
so I was thinking
I would do one better,

15:48.330 --> 15:49.420
and show you a sketch.

15:49.420 --> 15:50.790
Okay, let's see it.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.500
I don't have it.
(laughs)

15:52.500 --> 15:55.210
But, uh, maybe
I can just sketch it for ya.
Do you have a pen?

15:55.210 --> 15:57.460
A pencil?
I'll take a french fry
with some ketchup on it.

15:57.460 --> 15:59.710
No. I-- I've got
some lip liner.

15:59.710 --> 16:00.960
Okay.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.620
Hey, that's a nice color, girl.
Where you get that-- I'm sorry.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.830
So, it's a jacket, right?
It's a jacket.

16:08.830 --> 16:11.080
It's a retro cinched waist.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.460
You can wear it
casual or fancy.

16:12.460 --> 16:14.540
Impressive design, Raven.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.920
You like it?

16:15.920 --> 16:16.830
Thank you.

16:16.830 --> 16:17.830
Can I keep it?

16:17.830 --> 16:19.330
Yeah, of course!

16:20.790 --> 16:21.960
(gasps) JK!

16:21.960 --> 16:23.710
You can't have this.
You can't have this right now.

16:23.710 --> 16:26.420
Do you know why?
Because my daughter's speech
is on this.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.710
-Isn't that crazy?
-It's...

16:27.710 --> 16:30.290
-Our daughters worked so hard--
-(stammering) It's on fire.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.540
Okay, okay,
so here's the deal.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.040
-We're not gonna tell--
-It's on fire!

16:33.040 --> 16:34.960
We're not gonna
tell my daughter.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.290
Okay, first up.
We have Nia Baxter-Carter.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.880
That's me, that's me!
I'm up!

16:41.500 --> 16:42.790
Is that my speech?

16:44.380 --> 16:45.790
Baby girl, you, um...

16:45.790 --> 16:48.120
you wouldn't happen
to have memorized
your speech, would you?

17:02.960 --> 17:04.420
How you doin'?

17:04.420 --> 17:05.830
Listen.

17:05.830 --> 17:08.000
I'm looking for a little
12-year-old girl.

this wide,

her face looked like this.

You should let me talk to her.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.040
But this is important.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.710
You wanna know
what else is important?

17:56.710 --> 17:58.120
My job.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.670
And that's to say "no."
So, no.

18:00.670 --> 18:04.120
Okay, fine. Fine.
I-- I can be scary too.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.670
Not as scary as you.

18:13.380 --> 18:14.880
Oh, no, no, no.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.960
Councilwoman
hates yellow mustard.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.790
She'll only eat grain mustard.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.750
I don't know what else to do.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.210
I fed him, gave him water,

18:34.210 --> 18:36.000
and I even tried
to play ball with him.

18:37.210 --> 18:38.500
5:43.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.830
Feel like a failure.

18:42.170 --> 18:44.330
5:43 and 10 seconds.

18:44.330 --> 18:48.000
(crying):
Still feeling like a failure.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.330
Sebastian, stop.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.580
You're not a failure.

18:51.580 --> 18:52.920
You're a good assistant.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.580
Yeah, you do
a lot of great things.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.920
See? Look right here.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.000
9:23.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.460
Made the kids bacon
and eggs for breakfast.

19:01.460 --> 19:04.040
You did?
Thought we had cereal.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.290
Keep reading.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.790
9:28.

19:08.790 --> 19:11.880
Ate the bacon and eggs
I made the kids for breakfast.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.750
They were...

19:13.750 --> 19:16.330
♪ Delicious ♪

19:16.330 --> 19:17.250
Really?

19:17.250 --> 19:18.580
Yeah.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.290
See? Look how it's spelled.

19:20.290 --> 19:21.420
How would you read that?

19:22.960 --> 19:25.170
♪ Delicious ♪

19:25.170 --> 19:27.040
What's your point?

19:27.040 --> 19:30.250
My point is
you're a great assistant.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.920
And you're in charge!

19:31.920 --> 19:34.170
In charge of failure!

19:34.960 --> 19:37.880
This log is filled with
all kinds of important stuff.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.710
Like my mom's schedule,

19:39.710 --> 19:41.540
her contact list,

19:41.540 --> 19:43.420
all of her fashion designs.

19:43.420 --> 19:46.080
Of course I have
all her fashion designs.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.040
I know every piece
of fabric she uses.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.420
Her threading,
every button, stitch,
and hem!

19:51.420 --> 19:53.920
Wait! With all this information,

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
we could totally
rebuild this jacket.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.290
Yes! Yes, let's do this!

19:58.290 --> 19:59.750
Oh, no!

19:59.750 --> 20:01.250
Your hands aren't
touching anything!

20:01.250 --> 20:02.960
I'm fixing this!

20:02.960 --> 20:04.460
5:45.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.540
I'm back in charge, baby!

20:11.920 --> 20:13.250
(in deep voice):
Grain mustard.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.500
Thank you.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.580
(normal voice)
Room service!

20:27.580 --> 20:29.420
Johnson:
Be right out!

20:29.420 --> 20:30.790
Can you please
set it up for me?

20:30.790 --> 20:32.000
No problem.

20:37.790 --> 20:38.620
Okay.

20:40.750 --> 20:41.830
Uh-oh.

20:41.830 --> 20:43.000
That's pepper.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.500
(sneezing)

20:44.500 --> 20:46.080
Johnson:
Bless you.

20:46.080 --> 20:46.960
Thanks.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.540
Extremely sensitive to pepper.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.040
Runs in the family, yeah.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.460
(Raven sneezes loudly)

20:57.460 --> 20:59.120
Johnson:
Oh, your sneeze got deeper.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.040
Are you okay?

21:00.040 --> 21:01.620
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

21:02.830 --> 21:04.000
Mom, what are you doing?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.960
Listen, when you couldn't
make it through the door,

21:05.960 --> 21:07.460
-I thought it was up to me--
-(sneezes loudly)

21:11.830 --> 21:14.420
Just stay under here
and don't make a sound.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.000
Johnson:
Oh, that smells good!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.330
I hope they didn't put
cream sauce on anything.

21:22.330 --> 21:24.670
Dairy tends
to give me dia-- Nia!

21:25.790 --> 21:27.290
What are you doing here?

21:27.290 --> 21:29.170
I know this looks bad,

21:29.170 --> 21:32.540
but I promise there is
a perfectly good reason
for me to sneak in here

21:32.540 --> 21:34.000
dressed a room service waiter.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.120
I'm waiting.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.500
Right.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.290
Okay. I couldn't give
my speech earlier for...

21:41.460 --> 21:43.790
various reasons, but...

21:43.790 --> 21:46.000
I feel like if you would
listen to my speech,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.580
you would really consider me
for Neighborhood Youth Council.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.670
You're a persistent one,
aren't you?

21:51.920 --> 21:53.330
(muffled sneeze)

21:55.330 --> 21:57.040
Fine. Let's hear it.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.710
(clears throat)

21:58.710 --> 22:00.540
"When I ask myself the question,

22:00.540 --> 22:01.750
"'What makes a great leader?'

22:01.750 --> 22:03.380
"the answer for me is clear.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.710
"Learning from a great leader,

22:06.710 --> 22:08.880
and in my case,
that would be my--"

22:08.880 --> 22:10.710
(Raven sneezes loudly)

22:10.710 --> 22:12.290
(coughs)

22:12.290 --> 22:13.460
-"...my mother."
-(sneezes)

22:16.210 --> 22:18.210
Well, this isn't my room.

22:18.210 --> 22:20.120
I demand to know
what's going on here.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.080
What's going on is

22:24.080 --> 22:27.380
your daughter's been trying
very hard to impress me all day,

22:27.380 --> 22:28.710
and you've been
ruining it for her.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.040
Thanks for noticing.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.380
So, what's gonna happen now is

22:32.380 --> 22:33.750
you're going to leave
the room,

22:33.750 --> 22:35.040
and let your daughter
impress me.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.460
Without interruption.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.210
Yes, councilwoman.

22:39.210 --> 22:40.710
(sniffling)

22:40.710 --> 22:42.040
I'll be outside.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.960
Nia, you may begin.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.920
Nia:
Thanks. (clears throat)

22:51.920 --> 22:53.960
"When I ask
myself the question,

22:53.960 --> 22:55.420
'What makes--'" Yeah.

22:55.420 --> 22:57.120
Listen, wait, wait.
Hold up now.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.380
Bruh, bruh, bruh.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.670
Don't look at me like that.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.580
If you had kids,
you'd understand.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.080
(gasps) Well?

23:09.080 --> 23:09.960
Well...

23:09.960 --> 23:11.250
You're looking
at the newest member

23:11.250 --> 23:13.620
of Councilwoman Johnson's
Neighborhood Youth Council.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.750
(both squealing excitedly)

23:15.750 --> 23:17.290
That's my girl!

23:17.290 --> 23:18.380
(both giggle)

23:19.460 --> 23:20.960
Hey, Nia?
Did you really mean it

23:20.960 --> 23:23.290
when you said you learned
to be a great leader from me?

23:23.290 --> 23:24.710
I did.

23:24.710 --> 23:26.750
You really think I would have
dressed up like room service

23:26.750 --> 23:28.210
and snuck into the
councilwoman's room

23:28.210 --> 23:30.120
if you weren't my mother?

23:30.120 --> 23:31.380
I learned from the best.

23:31.380 --> 23:32.500
That's my baby!

23:32.500 --> 23:33.620
Nia, I love you!

23:37.620 --> 23:38.790
(door opens)

23:38.790 --> 23:41.920
(gasps)
You did it, Sebastian!

23:41.920 --> 23:43.790
It looks just like
it did before!

23:43.790 --> 23:45.250
And you look
like you did before.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.460
You two are dog-less.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.170
And now, Mom
will never have to know

23:48.170 --> 23:49.460
that any of this
ever happened.

23:49.460 --> 23:50.580
Right, Sebastian?

23:50.580 --> 23:52.250
I'll never say a word.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.420
I got your back.

23:54.620 --> 23:55.960
We're home!

23:55.960 --> 23:57.620
My baby! My baby!

23:57.620 --> 23:59.540
My baby! (squealing)

23:59.540 --> 24:02.210
It is exactly how I left it!

24:02.210 --> 24:04.080
Do you know that Shinée said
that after the retreat,

24:04.080 --> 24:05.580
I can e-mail her a picture
whenever I wanted?

24:05.580 --> 24:07.120
Stop it!

24:07.120 --> 24:08.250
-Raven: I know!
-Whoa!

24:08.250 --> 24:09.580
-(Sebastian laughing)
-Nia: Wow.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.000
Thank you so much
for keeping it safe.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Well, I promised I would!

24:13.000 --> 24:15.040
Hey, Nia, how'd
your conference go?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.000
Oh, great!

24:16.000 --> 24:17.330
You are looking at
the newest member

24:17.330 --> 24:18.920
of the Neighborhood
Youth Council.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.420
Stop it!

24:20.420 --> 24:22.000
Whoa! Ha ha!

24:22.000 --> 24:24.040
-Oh!
-(cackling)
