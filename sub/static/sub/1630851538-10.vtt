00:17.267 --> 00:20.353
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.731
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.859
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.281
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.953
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.455
-A scary tale.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.331
-A strange tale.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.709
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.213
-You really think you can handle it?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.266
Once upon a time…

01:00.477 --> 01:02.020
I don't know what to say.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.822
-Jehorsephat?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.533
You are my knight in shining armor.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.369
Those are
merely melted spoons.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.915
Rather painful, actually.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.421
Hmm! I hope you'll be happy with him.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.714
I'm sure she will be.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.466
I was talking to Jehorsephat.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.806
We failed.

01:37.889 --> 01:41.893
-But we tried, Gretel. We tried.

01:41.976 --> 01:42.936
You tried?

01:43.019 --> 01:46.231
-Oh, marvelous.

01:46.314 --> 01:50.235
Yeah. The children tried. Oh, how nice.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.904
We gave the children's plan
a shot, didn't we?

01:52.987 --> 01:54.280
We took a crack at it.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.949
Ran it up the old flag pole.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.909
Gave it the old chimmery chammery.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.120
Oh, such a shame it didn't work, hm?

02:00.203 --> 02:01.329
-Ugh!
-Oh, rotten luck.

02:01.412 --> 02:02.956
Oh well, at least you tried.

02:03.039 --> 02:07.001
I guess tonight I can snuggle up
with a big pile of "you tried!"

02:07.085 --> 02:10.171
-How many are dead?! How many?!

02:10.255 --> 02:13.675
Children! We followed children
to battle a dragon!

02:13.758 --> 02:15.885
-Were we insane?
-What were we thinking?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.471
Children are so short!
We followed children!

02:18.555 --> 02:20.515
-We could've been chopped in two!
-Wait!

02:20.598 --> 02:22.767
Look at her. What do you see?

02:22.851 --> 02:23.726
A girl?

02:23.810 --> 02:24.644
The princess!

02:24.727 --> 02:27.897
Her battle gear is tacky!
Is that what you're gettin' at?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.024
That! Tell them what that is!

02:32.235 --> 02:33.570
It's dragon's blood.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.240
Dragon's blood.

02:37.323 --> 02:40.785
No one has ever hurt the dragon,
but these children did.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.497
-And if it can be hurt, it can be killed.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.707
Oh, he's right.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.458
-It can be hurt.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.252
Well, yeah, that's something!

02:49.961 --> 02:52.589
You did well here.
We'll tend to the wounded.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.799
You should get some rest.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.051
Thank you.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.057
What do we do now?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.101
-Where do we go?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.937
Shouldn't we go home
and check on Mom and Dad?

03:08.021 --> 03:11.733
They didn't think we could do this.
Why should we go back?

03:11.816 --> 03:15.111
-I need to know if they're okay.

03:17.363 --> 03:22.076
And so, Hansel and Gretel have decided
to return home where they will…

03:22.160 --> 03:23.953
-Uh…

03:24.037 --> 03:26.414
What are they gonna do?
I don't know what they'll do!

03:26.497 --> 03:28.416
Are you guys permanently ravens now?

03:28.499 --> 03:31.961
'Cause if you're gonna turn
into something else, I vote for penguins.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.671
They're hilarious.

03:35.548 --> 03:39.302
Uh, I don't know.
I just want Hansel and Gretel to be okay.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.804
The dragon's still out there!

03:41.888 --> 03:43.848
We have to make sure they're safe!
Come on!

03:43.932 --> 03:46.643
No, but guys, there's so much
good dead stuff back there.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.145
-And, like, no one's eating it.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.690
Ugh! You guys are bad at being scavengers.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.671
My children!

04:20.093 --> 04:21.135
You're safe!

04:22.971 --> 04:23.805
You came back!

04:25.515 --> 04:27.767
Oh… …are you hurt?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.357
I see.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.275
Come on.

04:35.858 --> 04:36.901
Let's get inside.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.412
I had almost gotten
to the top of the tree,

04:47.495 --> 04:48.913
but then the dragon attacked.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.375
Oh dear, that must have been terrifying.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.418
But we fought it!

04:53.501 --> 04:55.795
Gretel tricked the moon
into chomping its face,

04:55.878 --> 04:58.298
and I cut off one of its big nasty toes.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.549
-Chop!

05:00.717 --> 05:04.053
-You have both made me so proud.
-But it didn't matter.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.307
People trusted us and we failed them.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.643
-Not at all. You wounded the dragon.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.439
No one has ever done that before.
Don't you see what you've done?

05:16.441 --> 05:18.443
You've given the people hope,

05:19.027 --> 05:21.738
and hope is a truly powerful gift.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.254
This is so sweet!

05:38.338 --> 05:41.632
I'm crying! I'm crying!

05:41.716 --> 05:45.136
Ravens can't cry.
You're just screeching horribly.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.972
-There are no tears.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.515
What are tears?!

05:49.599 --> 05:52.727
Uh, you know,
when water comes out of your eyes?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.228
Eyeball juice?!

05:54.312 --> 05:58.107
-Tell me more, tell me everything!
-Whoa!

05:58.191 --> 05:59.859
-Oops!

05:59.942 --> 06:02.195
-Ugh! Be gone! Ugh.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.239
Talking ravens are
a sign of the apocalypse!

06:05.323 --> 06:07.158
-Oh, come on.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.120
A talking raven!

06:12.580 --> 06:15.124
Oh, uh, hello. Pardon us. Uh…

06:15.208 --> 06:18.127
We've been watching you
and your family for a long time.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.421
Shh! William, that sounds creepy!

06:21.130 --> 06:22.882
Huh? Oh, no! No, it's not like that!

06:22.965 --> 06:26.803
We've-- We've just been telling everyone
private details about your children.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.265
Oh, you're just making it worse, buddy.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.059
It's all right.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.395
They're weird, but they saved my life.

06:37.021 --> 06:37.980
Well, then,

06:38.064 --> 06:39.816
you have my eternal thanks.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.902
Oh, you are most welcome, my Queen.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.196
-Psst!
-Uh…

06:45.279 --> 06:46.489
-Oh, right!
-Ow!

06:46.572 --> 06:49.200
Yeah, we almost got killed, but no biggie.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.910
No need to thank us,

06:50.993 --> 06:54.997
no need to give us, say,
a lifetime supply of worms and bugs!

06:55.081 --> 06:57.500
It is a family moment.
Go on, move it. Let's go.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.293
All right, no need to shove.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.380
Hey, wait a second!
Wh-- What about the bugs?

07:02.463 --> 07:05.007
-I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.513
I'm so glad you're home,
as is your father.

07:10.596 --> 07:14.350
You know, when you first ran away,
he searched and searched for you.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.438
He didn't sleep,
he wouldn't eat any chocolate cake.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.355
Really?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.398
Yes.

07:20.481 --> 07:24.986
Every single day he was gone,
I knitted an inch of a scarf,

07:25.069 --> 07:26.779
and now I have this.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.907
It went on for months.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.035
He was absolutely consumed with despair.

07:33.661 --> 07:37.415
Your father is still in bed.
The poor dear.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.500
He's worried sick.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.752
I've never seen him in such a state.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.923
-My children!

07:51.179 --> 07:52.430
I was so worried.

07:52.513 --> 07:56.392
The thought of losing you again
was more than I could bear.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.020
-Give them time.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.648
-Huh?

08:03.399 --> 08:06.486
-What happened to your foot?
-You know, I, uh…

08:06.569 --> 08:09.280
-I'm not entirely certain.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.615
And your face?

08:10.698 --> 08:11.699
What?

08:11.782 --> 08:15.786
I, uh… I must have
cut myself shaving.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.540
It's funny. I can't quite recall.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.126
So…

08:22.960 --> 08:23.878
Who wants cake?

08:23.961 --> 08:25.796
-No thank you, Father.

08:27.298 --> 08:31.093
We're very tired and I think
we'll just go right to bed. Bye!

08:33.596 --> 08:35.848
I was really looking forward to cake.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.900
Dad is the dragon!

08:45.983 --> 08:49.695
Because the dragon's an evil spirit that
possesses someone consumed by despair,

08:49.779 --> 08:52.698
and our dad was consumed by despair
when we ran away.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.867
And also our dad loves chocolate cake…

08:54.951 --> 08:57.537
And the dragon
loves chocolate cake!

08:59.705 --> 09:00.831
Uh…

09:00.915 --> 09:05.545
I meant because Dad has wounds
on his face and his foot like the dragon,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.755
but what you said makes sense too.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.259
-He doesn't know that we know…

09:11.342 --> 09:13.261
-…so we could--

09:15.638 --> 09:18.307
What are we…
Are we not running away again?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.267
No!

09:19.976 --> 09:22.436
And how do you make
those bed sheet ropes so fast?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.230
I've had lots of practice.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.733
We tried running away last time,
and it didn't work out.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.528
So maybe this time we face the problem.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.407
And do what has to be done
for the safety of the kingdom.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.617
Once upon a time,

09:36.701 --> 09:39.537
Hansel and Gretel
set out to confront the dragon…

09:41.789 --> 09:43.916
-who was their father!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.210
And bring him to justice!

09:46.294 --> 09:49.547
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Dial it back a notch, big guy!

09:49.630 --> 09:53.342
For they were consumed
with the righteous fury of righteousness!

09:53.426 --> 09:57.054
Oh yeah.
There's gonna be so much blood! Bring it!

09:57.138 --> 09:58.055
Mmm!

09:58.139 --> 10:00.349
Um, I don't know about blood.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.518
I mean, he is our dad.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.644
You want some?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.771
-The live ones tickle going down.
-Blech.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.565
What did I tell you guys?

10:08.232 --> 10:11.777
You said people don't want strange birds
narrating their family tragedies.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.572
You don't know what people want.
I bet they like it.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.993
Okay, we have to find out for sure.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.163
-And if he is the dragon… then…

10:23.247 --> 10:24.248
…we…

10:24.332 --> 10:25.207
uh…

10:25.916 --> 10:26.751
What?

10:28.127 --> 10:29.086
I don't know.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.839
I was hoping you would know.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.008
Usually you're the thing-knowing one.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.559
Mmm! Mmm.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.981
We're so close
to being a family again.

10:50.149 --> 10:50.983
Indeed.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.073
Then why do I feel so uneasy?

10:58.991 --> 10:59.992
-Father!

11:01.327 --> 11:03.371
What ever were you doing last night?

11:03.454 --> 11:06.165
-Ahem. Mmm. I was, uh…

11:07.458 --> 11:08.626
…sleeping?

11:08.709 --> 11:09.585
-Soundly?

11:09.669 --> 11:13.297
Or did you have restless dreams
of blood and fire?

11:13.381 --> 11:14.590
Blood and fire?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.842
And did you fly around and kill everyone?

11:16.926 --> 11:20.221
I don't know.
I just, uh, fell asleep.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.306
Some people might have trouble sleeping

11:22.390 --> 11:25.267
if their only children
were out fighting a dragon.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.770
Yes. I-- I thought I would, but I…

11:27.853 --> 11:31.065
I closed my eyes, and I--
I don't remember anything.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.151
-You don't remember cutting your face?
-I cut myself shaving!

11:34.735 --> 11:36.362
I mean…

11:36.445 --> 11:37.279
I guess, I…

11:37.363 --> 11:39.490
I must have.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.659
You don't remember
what happened to your foot?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.119
I, uh… I…

11:43.202 --> 11:46.372
This is ridiculous.
What are you suggesting?

11:46.455 --> 11:48.290
The dragon's face was injured.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.709
And his foot.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.711
You think your father is the dragon?

11:51.794 --> 11:54.213
-What? That's madness!

11:54.296 --> 11:58.175
How could you accuse me
of such a horrible thing? My own children!

11:58.259 --> 12:00.553
-Stop it!
-I've tried to understand you.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.096
-To love you…

12:02.179 --> 12:05.558
-But you two are monsters. Monsters!

12:05.641 --> 12:07.601
You're the monster!

12:07.685 --> 12:10.146
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.648
-And I'm sure that you do.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.869
-Father, fight it.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.579
-Please!

12:32.543 --> 12:34.670
Come on, Father, you can do this!

12:34.754 --> 12:37.423
-We don't wanna lose you again!

12:41.927 --> 12:44.305
My love! Where have you gone?!

12:52.438 --> 12:53.314
Let go!

14:11.183 --> 14:12.977
Now what?

14:16.522 --> 14:17.731
The twine!

14:18.315 --> 14:21.235
I've got the warlock's magic twine!
Bring me his head!

14:21.318 --> 14:22.778
-What? Gross!

14:22.862 --> 14:23.779
Just do it!

14:26.365 --> 14:27.449
-Got it!

14:31.370 --> 14:33.747
Is it looking at me?
I think it's looking at me!

14:34.915 --> 14:37.793
Please, please, please, work.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.045
-Uh…

14:41.547 --> 14:43.549
Come on! Come on!

14:44.091 --> 14:45.092
-There.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.219
Will it work?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.429
It has to.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.518
Why isn't it working?!

14:54.602 --> 14:57.396
The twine got its power
from those girls' souls.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.275
Now that they're free,
the magic must be gone.

15:01.358 --> 15:04.820
You-- You mean he's really gone?

15:18.250 --> 15:21.170
-I'm so sorry, Father.

15:49.907 --> 15:50.950
-Who…

15:51.033 --> 15:53.285
-…wants cake?

15:53.911 --> 15:54.954
-Dad!
-Father!

15:56.538 --> 15:57.498
My family.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.417
-Oh, my love!
-My Queen!

16:01.210 --> 16:02.211
But, how did--

16:02.294 --> 16:04.463
The tears. The tears made it work.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.840
-It is like Johannes said.

16:06.924 --> 16:10.260
-"Tears hold a bit of the soul."
-Tears hold a bit of the soul.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.805
-"And the soul has magic."
-And the soul has magic.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.140
My wonderful children,

16:15.224 --> 16:17.726
can you… can you forgive me?

16:18.435 --> 16:19.353
Forgive us?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.994
-Huh?

16:35.077 --> 16:37.746
This eyeball juice is amazing!

16:39.999 --> 16:42.084
Is there anything eyeballs can't do?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.253
-I'm sorry we ran away.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.463
I'm sorry I cut off your heads.

16:46.547 --> 16:50.551
No, I'm sorry
I cut off your head, and your toe.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.553
I'm sorry I cut off my finger.

16:52.636 --> 16:56.265
There will be no more cutting
off of anything in this family.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.350
We're just happy to be home

16:58.434 --> 17:00.060
and have most of our parts.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.770
We're going to be okay.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.106
Maybe, but even if we're not,

17:05.065 --> 17:07.151
we'll be not okay as a family.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.197
And so,

17:12.781 --> 17:18.412
Hansel and Gretel realized that the family
they had searched so far and so long for…

17:18.495 --> 17:21.373
-…was in the place and with the people

17:21.457 --> 17:23.834
they called home.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.088
-The… end.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.798
-Almost.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.677
-What on Earth are you talking about?
-It's not quite over. Look.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.860
-Look! The dragon!

17:59.411 --> 18:01.872
The dragon is dead!

18:01.955 --> 18:04.416
-How did you kill it?
-Were you there when it happened?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.211
Did it turn out that
you were the dragon the whole time?

18:07.294 --> 18:08.712
No further questions.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.551
For you, Hansel!

18:17.846 --> 18:19.181
He's a good boy.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.392
One day,
you'll officially rule the kingdom.

18:22.476 --> 18:26.814
I think, officially,
we're good with being children for now.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.817
There are times
when a kingdom needs its children.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.486
-All the times, in fact.

18:32.569 --> 18:37.157
But for now,
we will rule Grimm as a family.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.900
And so, they all lived happily,

19:11.984 --> 19:14.444
and sadly, and lovingly,

19:14.528 --> 19:18.073
and complicatedly ever after.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.701
The end.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.705
The King, the Queen,
Hansel, and Gretel value wisdom,

19:24.788 --> 19:26.832
courage and heart,

19:26.915 --> 19:29.710
but they also value the power of stories.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.755
That's why they made us
the kingdom's royal storytellers.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.925
Which is crazy.
I've never been a royal anything.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.094
Except Jacob says
I'm a royal pain in the butt.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.888
I didn't even know butts had royalty.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.764
Who's the butt King and the butt Queen?

19:44.766 --> 19:47.978
And we're fine with the fact
that we'll never be human again.

19:48.061 --> 19:51.190
Wait.
You guys used to be human?

19:51.273 --> 19:54.484
Dotty, we told you that
like a thousand times!

19:54.568 --> 19:56.195
Mind blown, man!

19:56.278 --> 19:58.989
Mind blown.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.116
Excuse me.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.036
What happened
to the other people in the story?

20:04.119 --> 20:04.995
We wanna know!

20:05.078 --> 20:07.122
What happened?
I loved Mother Tree.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.249
The dove girls were awesome.
Who went to hell?

20:09.333 --> 20:12.878
Uh, all right.
Well, children, I'm glad you asked.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.925
-Oh, we are so naughty!

20:18.008 --> 20:21.637
Don't tell your son,
but I am having the best time here.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.829
Ahem.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.961
-Oh… Oh!

20:54.419 --> 20:55.796
Oh! Oh.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.048
-Oh!

20:58.131 --> 20:59.675
-Oh!

20:59.758 --> 21:01.551
Oh…

21:06.807 --> 21:08.100
Oh!

21:09.101 --> 21:10.769
I'm not a widow anymore.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.438
For now.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.481
-Oh!

21:27.828 --> 21:30.163
Could you take this for a second?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.958
Ah-ah! A lord doesn't fall for a trick.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.626
That's a rule!

21:36.586 --> 21:41.591
One day, someone will take this pole,
and I will be disreleased!

21:41.675 --> 21:42.759
I assurify you!

21:43.677 --> 21:46.305
You use words incorrectly.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.597
But of course I do.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.475
-Nothing could be more evil.

21:50.559 --> 21:54.730
But the King was possessed
by the mighty spirit of a dragon.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.065
Until we chopped off your head!

21:59.026 --> 22:04.239
And then a tiny dragon
climbed out of my neck?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.658
Yup! It was so gross.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.244
But, where did it go?

22:09.328 --> 22:10.996
We smashed it and burned it.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.873
-It won't come back.
-Trust us.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.045
We do.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.174
Should we go and see it again?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.384
And then off to bed.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.279
The End.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.073
For real this time.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.742
-And yet--
-Oh, come on. Seriously?

22:48.825 --> 22:53.330
One story's end is always
the beginning of another.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.624
I knew it! I'm getting a spin-off!

22:55.707 --> 23:00.087
Let's make it all about my adventures
in Cloudland and Lollipop Meadow.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.255
-Oh, please, no!
