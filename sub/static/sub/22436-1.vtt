01:11.504 --> 01:13.199
You won't talk it over, uh?

01:13.273 --> 01:14.706
It all got said last night.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.435
I think you're making
a mistake, Pete.

01:16.509 --> 01:18.602
Seven years on the job,
senior man on the watch.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.646
Maybe. You've been assigned
a new man tonight.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.238
Name's Reed, Jim Reed.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.612
[people chattering]

01:23.683 --> 01:25.275
23 years old,
probationer.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.118
Never guess it, would you?

01:27.187 --> 01:29.212
He finished up in the
top 10 of his class,

01:29.289 --> 01:31.382
shooting four-dollar money.
Looks good on paper.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.618
They all do.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.160
Too bad he won't have somebody
to hold his hand.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.527
I did that once, remember?

01:54.914 --> 01:57.109
(Wangsgard) All right,
generally, you look pretty good.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.845
We could use a few less
fingerprints on the cap bills.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.820
Some badges aren't hitting the shine
rug as you leave the locker room,

02:02.889 --> 02:06.347
and remember, in this division you can
cut yourself on those shirt creases.

02:06.426 --> 02:07.415
Sergeant.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.524
Watch, attention!

02:09.663 --> 02:11.027
Okay, let's hit the field.

02:11.097 --> 02:12.189
Fall out!

02:30.383 --> 02:32.317
Didn't we meet at roll call?
Yes, sir.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.647
You know,
I can tell right off,

02:33.720 --> 02:35.711
Yes, sir? ...you got a real
flair for police work.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.416
Yes, sir.
Reed, do me a favor.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.425
Yes, sir? See if you can manage
to follow me to the car.

02:45.865 --> 02:48.959
Bill, how about those reds, were they checked?
They were BO last night.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.866
They're okay. Shotgun's
locked in the rack,

02:50.937 --> 02:53.405
gave it the five-point safety check.
I'll sign you out for it.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.633
Thanks!

Yes, sir.
It's a police car.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.149
<i>(female dispatcher)
1-Adam-22...</i>

03:09.889 --> 03:11.652
This black-and-white
patrol car

03:11.725 --> 03:13.420
has an overhead valve
V-eight engine.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.462
It develops 325
horsepower at 4800 RPMs.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.929
It accelerates from 0-60
in seven seconds.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.228
It has a top speed
of 120 miles an hour.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.360
It's equipped with a
multi-channel DFE radio,

03:23.436 --> 03:26.234
an electronic siren capable of
emitting three variables:

03:26.306 --> 03:27.603
wail, yelp and alert.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.609
It also serves as an outside radio
speaker and a public address system.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.372
This automobile has
two shotgun racks,

03:32.445 --> 03:34.436
one attached to the bottom
portion of the front seat,

03:34.514 --> 03:35.606
one in the vehicle trunk.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.149
Attached to the middle
of the dash,

03:37.217 --> 03:39.583
illuminated by a single bulb,
is a hot-sheet desk,

03:39.652 --> 03:41.347
fastened to which
you will make sure

03:41.421 --> 03:43.616
is the latest one off the
teletype before you ever roll.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.782
Yes, sir.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.421
It's your life insurance.
And mine.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.020
You take care of it,
it'll take care of you.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.792
Yes, sir.
You want me to drive?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.979
I just heard.
Captain will be here at 8:00.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.412
Coming by to pick up
his speech.

04:09.482 --> 04:10.676
I'll be here.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.511
You've got some days coming,
Pete,

04:12.585 --> 04:14.576
maybe if you'd give yourself
a little more time.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.088
Iran out of that two weeks
ago at that warehouse, Val.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.418
See you at 8:00.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.305
Hats in the back
these roofs are too low.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.636
Oh, sure.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.767
Anything special to do
with the old hot-sheet?

04:37.844 --> 04:39.573
Fold it up and save it
for scratch-paper.

04:39.646 --> 04:40.943
We've got a whole pad
right here.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.448
Fold it and save it.
It's gonna be along night.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.414
The keys?

04:45.552 --> 04:46.678
Oh!

04:48.087 --> 04:49.452
[keys jangling]

04:50.390 --> 04:51.618

04:51.691 --> 04:52.680
Clear us.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.851
Huh?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.485
You know
where the radio is?

04:55.562 --> 04:56.824
Yes, sir.
It's right there.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.056
Clear us.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.065
This is...

05:04.737 --> 05:07.399
This is Unit-1A-12,
we are clear.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.609

05:44.177 --> 05:45.735
Yes, sir,
you want me to look it up?

05:45.812 --> 05:46.779
That'd be a good idea.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.837
Yes, sir, I'll have it for you
in just a second.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.746
Not for me, for you.
Huh?

05:50.817 --> 05:52.375
That's why
you're not driving.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.220
(Reed) There they are.
Two guys and a woman.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.517
Hit the reds.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.458
[yelling]

06:07.867 --> 06:09.630

Well, that's enough!

06:09.702 --> 06:10.726
[woman crying]

06:10.803 --> 06:12.361
All right, lady,
now hold it, hold it!

06:12.438 --> 06:14.099
It's still on me,

06:14.173 --> 06:17.267
I know it is. I can feel it,
I can feel it!

06:17.377 --> 06:18.969
Take it easy, lady,
take it easy.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.034
What's this all about?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.705
I'm in my truck,
that's it over there.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.373
I'm just tooling along
this side street

06:23.449 --> 06:25.474
and I see this crumb
trying to assault this lady.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.540
That is a lie.

06:26.619 --> 06:27.813
Was he trying to assault you?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.650
No, I don't know what
he was trying to do.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.349
He kept putting his fingers
in my mouth.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.449
I was trying to keep her
from swallowing her tongue.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.788
Sure you was.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.453
What do you mean
swallowing her tongue?

06:36.529 --> 06:38.087
I saw this woman
jumping up and down,

06:38.164 --> 06:39.688
going through all sorts
of gyrations.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.326
Then she fell to the street. I
figured she was having a seizure.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.869
Are you subject
to seizures, ma'am?

06:43.937 --> 06:46.838
Of course not.
It's this thing.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.238
I know it's on me,
I can feel it.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.435
Feel what, ma'am,
what thing?

06:50.510 --> 06:51.943
I'll show you,

06:52.011 --> 06:55.469
I had it in a box
before it got away.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.680
See, it was in here.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.346
Never mind,
it's all a mistake.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.220
Thank you very much
all of you.

07:09.729 --> 07:10.889
(Reed)
Some kind of lizard?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.693
(Ruth)
It's a salamander.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.560
Yes, ma'am.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.193
My son's pet.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.364
I guess I thought it crawled
out of the box, but it didn't.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.464
No ma'am.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.271
(Ruth) It must have been
something else I felt, I guess.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.436
Yes, ma'am.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.241
Well, I hope I didn't cause
anybody any trouble.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.219
You don't have much confidence
in me, do you?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.627
I checked you out
in one piece,

07:44.697 --> 07:46.460
I want to check you back
in the same way.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.501
It's none of my business, but there's
something eating you, isn't there?

07:49.569 --> 07:50.661
You called it.
Yeah?

but you missed 'em.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.131
Who's that, sir?

08:30.209 --> 08:32.677
Two men in a green Buick sedan
sitting in there bold as brass.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.804
What were they doing that
aroused your suspicion?

08:34.881 --> 08:37.405
Listen, when you've been burglarized
three times in three months

08:37.482 --> 08:38.609
it don't take much.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.673
Where were they parked?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.549
In that lot,
right across the street there.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.918
How long ago
did they take off?

08:42.989 --> 08:45.890
Just two minutes before you got here,
they headed east down Moorpark.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.289
Can you describe the men?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.123
Just two men,
that's all I could see.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.662
Bareheaded.
Caucasian?

08:50.763 --> 08:53.163
They were. Did you get the
license number of the car?

08:53.232 --> 08:54.722
Indeed I did.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.160
We'll check it out.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.702
They are up to something,
those two.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.169
I can feel it in my bones.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.573
Three burglaries
in three months.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.732
If you're right,
maybe you won't have a fourth.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.321
Run it for a want.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.271
We'll work a grid system.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.505
Know what that is?
A circle search.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.715
Maybe they cleared
the neighborhood.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.761
Maybe.
They shouldn't be hinky.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.693
I got a hunch
they're still floating around.

How about seven?
Fine with me.

13:28.841 --> 13:31.901
1-Adam-12 requesting Code 7
at Burbank and Lankershim.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.908
<i>(female dispatcher)
1-Adam-12, okay 7.</i>

13:33.979 --> 13:35.412
1-Adam-12, thank you.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.444
[car engine starting]

13:43.923 --> 13:45.891
(Reed) Good place.
You eat here often?

13:46.425 --> 13:48.450
I switch around. I eat out
all the time anyway.

13:48.527 --> 13:49.494
You're not married?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.325
Never found anybody
that'd put up with me.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.126
Three years for me.
Wife's pregnant.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.191
We waited till I was sure I was going
to make the job to start a family.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.065
Guess that's the way to do it.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.328
Malloy.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.396
Yeah?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.340
You said it was none
of my business before,

14:04.410 --> 14:06.037
but I'd like to know.
Know what?

14:06.112 --> 14:08.808
You got some kind of problem,
maybe I could help.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.475
No, I mean it, Malloy,
I'd like to help if I can.

14:11.550 --> 14:12.642
I don't need any help.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.811
Wouldn't you like to talk it
over with somebody?

14:14.887 --> 14:16.752
All the talking's done.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.052
Sorry.
I guess I was outta line.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.020
No, you're not outta line.
I suppose I owe you this much.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.824
You won't be seeing me after
tonight. I'm leaving the job.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.256
Why?

14:26.732 --> 14:28.962
Why? You had to ask why,
didn't you?

14:29.034 --> 14:31.400
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

14:31.937 --> 14:35.373
About three weeks ago, a nice young
kid about your age got blown up.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.032
He was married.
They had a six-month-old baby.

14:39.011 --> 14:42.640
It tore me up inside and it's not gonna
get well as long as I pick at it.

14:42.748 --> 14:45.581
Well, in this kinda work, you get
used to guys dying, don't you?

14:45.651 --> 14:47.642
Not when they're your partner.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.682
(man) Where's the ambulance?
We called for an ambulance!

15:23.756 --> 15:25.747
Should be here any minute.
The child in there?

15:25.825 --> 15:27.884
On the bed.
Please do something.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.064
We left her
for just a minute.

15:43.142 --> 15:45.633
My--my wife was sewing
a button on my jacket.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.541
L-it just got it back
from the cleaners.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.843
The baby got tangled up in
the plastic bag, that right?

15:49.915 --> 15:52.509
Yes, w-we left her
for just a minute.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.920
We were going to
give her her bath.

16:03.195 --> 16:04.457
Dear God,

16:05.731 --> 16:07.756
please don't
let my baby die.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.700
Please don't let
little Gladys die.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.294
Please, dear God.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.135

Dear God...

16:21.447 --> 16:24.143

in the other room.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.452
[panting]

16:44.770 --> 16:47.568
It's no good. You better
tell 'em it's no good.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.975
I'll keep trying,
but she's not responding.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.475
I'm not sure
I know what to say.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.330
I'm sorry.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.770
Isn't there anything
you can do?

17:19.571 --> 17:21.631
My partner's doing
everything he can.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.276
You mean my baby's dead?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.401
Gladys is dead?

17:26.845 --> 17:28.574
She's so young.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.750
Sometimes they don't respond
like an older person would.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.409
Dear God in heaven!

17:34.587 --> 17:35.849
Please,

17:36.155 --> 17:37.452
help us.

You grow up and swim

You got the lungs for it.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.554
(Wangsgard)
He's not in.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.316
He said to tell you
he was sorry.

18:15.394 --> 18:16.452
He's running late.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.723
Carson dropped his speech off
on the way home.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.664
He told Carson he'd stop by the
station after the affair tonight.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.599
Said he'd meet you
when you go end of watch.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.433
Maybe I'll take a minute, scratch
it out and leave it on his desk.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.530
You know how the old man is
about resignations, Pete.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.438
He'll want you to write it
in his presence.

shotgun, two others have revolvers.

19:02.941 --> 19:05.000

they've shot the neighborhood.

Don't let 'em out that gate.

Yes, sir.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.931
See that next tree over?
Yes, sir.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.298
Move to it and stay put
till I tell you what to do.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.700
Yes, sir.
Repeat it back, junior.

tuck these three away?

Who do you think you are,
Sergeant York?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.723
Got in behind 'em.
Nothing to it really.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.693
Really?
You could've been killed.

22:09.761 --> 22:12.093
When I give you orders, boy,
you obey 'em, understand?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.961
Yes, sir, but I could see
from where I was

22:14.032 --> 22:15.329
that I could come
up behind 'em.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.391
I didn't figure you had
the same vantage point.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.562
So I just took the initiative
into my own hands.

22:19.638 --> 22:22.004
See if you can take this piece
into your own little hands

22:22.074 --> 22:24.167
and put it back in the rack.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.875
Yes, sir. I thought I was
doing the right thing.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.345
You're not supposed to think
yet, junior. Yes, sir.

22:29.414 --> 22:30.881
It's when you start
thinking before

22:30.949 --> 22:33.645
you're supposed to think
that you think yourself dead.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.013
See this tree?

22:38.090 --> 22:40.115
Marry it if you have to,
but I want you right here

22:40.192 --> 22:41.887
when I finish talking
to the Lieutenant.

22:41.960 --> 22:42.949
Yes, sir.

[people chattering]

22:52.905 --> 22:54.099
Good man, isn't he?

22:54.306 --> 22:56.001
He will be if he stays alive.

22:56.074 --> 22:57.439
You could keep him that way.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.531
Him?

22:59.011 --> 23:00.501
I don't know.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.047
He's too headstrong,
too eager, too young,

23:03.115 --> 23:04.207
not loose enough.

23:04.283 --> 23:05.614
He listens good
when he wants to,

23:05.684 --> 23:07.743
but all the time you can hear
those wheels spinning

23:07.819 --> 23:09.446
figuring a better way
than he's told.

23:09.521 --> 23:10.988
He talks too much
when he shouldn't,

23:11.056 --> 23:12.216
not enough when he should.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.952
His radio procedure
is rough as a cob.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.961
About all you can say for him
is he wears the uniform right.

23:17.095 --> 23:19.393
I told my watch commander the
same things about a youngster

23:19.464 --> 23:21.898
I rode with
when he first came on the job.

23:21.967 --> 23:25.528
Funny how you never seem to forget the
names of the ones you brought along.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.440
His was Malloy.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.509
The Captain's affair
broke up early.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.614
He's waiting for you
at the station.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.383
I heard what
the Lieutenant said

23:44.456 --> 23:46.321
about the Captain
being back at the station.

23:46.391 --> 23:47.380
You did?

23:47.459 --> 23:50.257
Yes, sir. I suppose you're
going back in to resign.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.819
I couldn't turn you loose yet

23:51.897 --> 23:53.558
on the citizens of
Los Angeles.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.792
No, sir.

23:54.866 --> 23:55.958
Not without a leash.

23:56.034 --> 23:57.399
No, sir.

23:57.469 --> 23:58.868
