WEBVTT

00:03.664 --> 00:04.864
Hey what are you doing?

00:04.965 --> 00:05.640
My neighbor died

00:05.665 --> 00:07.131
and he left me this cool couch.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.665
I thought it would be
good in the break room.

00:08.667 --> 00:09.916
Let me give you a hand.

00:09.918 --> 00:11.301
No, no, no. I got it.

00:12.337 --> 00:14.170
Boy, you don't need anybody, do you?

00:14.172 --> 00:16.973
You know, sometimes it's
okay to let someone help you.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.892
Yeah, I'll remember that.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

00:33.167 --> 00:34.972
You've got some nodes on your vocal cords.

00:35.072 --> 00:36.988
Nodes?! What the hell are nodes?

00:36.991 --> 00:38.241
You wanted to see us, sir?

00:38.243 --> 00:39.792
Yeah, don't mind the butcher here.

00:39.794 --> 00:41.494
I'm just having my insurance physical.

00:41.496 --> 00:43.646
Afraid we got a killing spree on our hands.

00:43.725 --> 00:46.630
The word "spree" makes it
sound fun, but it isn't.

00:46.631 --> 00:48.264
There's been a murder on the last three

00:48.265 --> 00:50.265
Thursday night evening
flights from New York to L.A.,

00:50.267 --> 00:51.717
all in first class.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.635
Sounds like someone has
it out for rich people.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.021
When are rich people gonna get a break?

00:56.023 --> 00:58.087
You two, head over to L.A.X.,

00:58.088 --> 01:00.004
figure out what the hell is going on.

01:00.006 --> 01:02.223
Meanwhile, the plane's been grounded. Why?

01:02.225 --> 01:03.975
Got in late. Didn't do its homework.

01:03.977 --> 01:05.393
We're on it, Lieutenant.

01:08.014 --> 01:09.431
How's the pressure, Doc?

01:09.433 --> 01:10.849
400/300.

01:12.068 --> 01:14.102
The yoga's really working.

01:16.406 --> 01:18.606
Welcome aboard. May I
see your boarding pass?

01:18.608 --> 01:20.859
3a. 3b.

01:20.861 --> 01:24.329
Enjoy your investigation.

01:24.331 --> 01:25.947
What do we got, Scholls?

01:25.949 --> 01:28.666
The deceased's name is George Prickly...

01:28.668 --> 01:31.953
42, Caucasian, white, early 40s.

01:31.955 --> 01:33.288
Is this gonna take long?

01:33.290 --> 01:36.624
I have a meeting in
Playa Vista in 15 minutes.

01:36.626 --> 01:37.959
Wait, are we sure he's dead?

01:37.961 --> 01:39.627
Yes, the nerves are the last thing to die,

01:39.629 --> 01:43.681
so the body may experience some
postmortem reflexive movement.

01:43.683 --> 01:45.467
If he were alive, would I do this?

01:57.113 --> 01:58.980
Where's my warm cookie?

01:58.982 --> 02:01.282
Do we know how he died?

02:01.284 --> 02:02.400
I do.

02:02.402 --> 02:04.152
Is there anyone from the flight crew

02:04.154 --> 02:06.154
we can talk to who might
have witnessed the murder?

02:06.156 --> 02:08.990
The first-class flight attendant
was on duty the entire time,

02:08.991 --> 02:11.659
a Vivian Tribeca.

02:11.661 --> 02:12.961
Oh, no.

02:12.963 --> 02:14.963
My ears are burning!

02:14.965 --> 02:19.050
Angie Tribeca, as I live and breathe.

02:19.052 --> 02:20.251
Are you guys related?

02:20.253 --> 02:22.387
She's my second cousin once removed.

02:22.389 --> 02:23.338
Why was she removed?

02:23.340 --> 02:24.839
Because she's really annoying.

02:24.841 --> 02:26.307
Hey, Vivian.

02:32.098 --> 02:36.184
And who is this extra-large
helping of banana man pie?

02:38.655 --> 02:41.573
Those flirtatious gestures
are making me really like her.

02:41.575 --> 02:45.109
So, Vivian, I forgot that
you work at Air Jordan now.

02:45.111 --> 02:47.445
It does help me stay out of trouble.

02:47.447 --> 02:49.864
What helps you stay out of trouble?

02:49.866 --> 02:51.499
Well, I've got my police work.

02:51.501 --> 02:54.252
I like to go to the gym as often as I can.

02:55.338 --> 02:58.373
Whatever you're doing,
it's working for you.

02:58.375 --> 03:01.175
Okay, Vivian, what can you
tell us about Mr. Prickly?

03:01.177 --> 03:02.677
Excuse my language,

03:02.679 --> 03:05.046
but he was a real bee in my bonnet.

03:05.048 --> 03:06.931
"More this. Less that."

03:06.933 --> 03:10.051
But I certainly didn't
wish any harm on him.

03:10.053 --> 03:12.136
Oh, I just feel woozy thinking about it.

03:12.138 --> 03:13.054
Ohh.

03:13.056 --> 03:15.056
Let me help you.

03:15.058 --> 03:16.274
Thank you, sir.

03:16.276 --> 03:18.393
I don't know what's wrong with me.

03:18.395 --> 03:20.228
Well, you've been through a
very traumatic situation, ma'am.

03:20.230 --> 03:22.230
It's brave of you to even talk to us.

03:22.232 --> 03:23.481
Me? Brave?

03:23.483 --> 03:26.200
My goodness gracious to bitsy Betsy,

03:26.202 --> 03:28.286
if you aren't the most wonderful gentleman

03:28.288 --> 03:30.872
on god's great big blue marble.

03:33.126 --> 03:34.492
Vivian, we need you to focus up

03:34.494 --> 03:36.411
and answer some questions
about what happened.

03:36.413 --> 03:38.246
Take it easy, Tribeca.
She's been through a lot.

03:38.248 --> 03:39.714
Do you need a ride home, Vivian?

03:39.716 --> 03:44.218
Yes, I think taken to bed
would be in my best interest.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.920
I'm just so scared.

03:47.340 --> 03:48.923
Why don't I drive your cousin home,

03:48.925 --> 03:50.425
and you finish up here?

03:50.427 --> 03:53.311
We're in the middle of
an investigation, Geils.

03:53.313 --> 03:56.064
You don't need me. You're fine on your own.

03:56.066 --> 03:57.565
Oh, my word.

03:57.567 --> 03:59.434
My buttons seem to have come undone.

03:59.436 --> 04:02.487
I can't believe that
works. It's so obvious.

04:02.489 --> 04:03.938
"Ooh, I'm so sweaty."

04:03.940 --> 04:06.524
My underwear just went sliding off."

04:09.362 --> 04:12.113
Want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?

04:15.207 --> 04:17.322
Did you come up with anything
from the passenger manifests?

04:17.325 --> 04:18.741
Two.

04:19.415 --> 04:21.165
There's 800 names on the manifest.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.000
And how many were on all three flights?

04:23.002 --> 04:25.944
40. And then we eliminated
the kids, the elderly,

04:26.044 --> 04:27.660
and members of the clergy.

04:27.663 --> 04:29.129
And how many did that leave?

04:29.131 --> 04:32.049
Two... Julia Gaffney and Gordon Manhattan.

04:32.051 --> 04:34.001
Why don't you interview Gaffney?

04:34.003 --> 04:35.919
I'll take Manhattan with Geils,

04:35.921 --> 04:38.758
- if I can ever pry him away from my cousin.
- Hum

04:38.858 --> 04:39.685
Hi.

04:39.715 --> 04:42.387
Uh, two chicken and two
carne fish for my friend here.

04:42.575 --> 04:44.875
Wait a minute. Are you jealous, Tribeca?

04:44.877 --> 04:46.243
Don't be ridiculous.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.129
Don't sweat it, Tribeca.
There's nothing wrong

04:48.131 --> 04:49.413
with admitting that you need somebody.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.582
I don't need anybody, and I never will.

04:51.584 --> 04:53.167
Never say "never."

04:58.508 --> 05:02.009
Uh, I take the kids to New York
because my mother lives there.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.095
Uh, Julian, for god's sakes,

05:04.097 --> 05:06.764
get the detective's pen out of your nose.

05:06.766 --> 05:08.933
He's not contagious anymore. You're fine.

05:08.935 --> 05:12.153
Do you recall seeing this
man on last week's flight?

05:12.155 --> 05:13.571
That guy... yeah.

05:13.573 --> 05:15.239
That guy... you know... Oh, Grace, come on!

05:15.241 --> 05:17.024
Leave the detective alone.

05:18.444 --> 05:19.443
Uh, sorry. Yes.

05:19.445 --> 05:20.413
So, we were at the airport,

05:20.414 --> 05:22.685
and that's the guy who
started yelling at my kids.

05:22.785 --> 05:24.585
I mean, nobody yells at my kids.

05:24.587 --> 05:26.253
For god's sakes, Philip!

05:26.255 --> 05:28.038
Here, take her, will you?

05:28.040 --> 05:29.623
Come here.

05:29.625 --> 05:32.092
Do you remember what happened last time?

05:32.094 --> 05:34.678
You were 7. Now you're 5.

05:36.182 --> 05:38.182
Let me cut to the chase, ma'am.

05:38.184 --> 05:41.769
Um, this guy was found
murdered on your flight.

05:41.771 --> 05:44.355
Oh, and you think I have the time.

05:44.357 --> 05:46.774
To put together a murder?

05:46.776 --> 05:47.808
I mean, I wish I c...

05:47.811 --> 05:49.978
Keith Urban Harrison Ford Gaffney!

05:49.979 --> 05:53.030
What have I told you about
the riding mower in the house?!

05:53.032 --> 05:55.816
Okay, ma'am. No further questions.

05:56.953 --> 05:59.069
You're the cutest puppy.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.092
Sorry I'm late.

06:05.093 --> 06:06.842
Vivian came down with
a case of the vapors...

06:06.844 --> 06:08.260
At least, that's what she declared.

06:08.262 --> 06:09.345
I couldn't care less.

06:09.347 --> 06:10.846
Let's just find out what this guy knows.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.315
Excuse me, we're looking
for Gordon Manhattan.

06:13.317 --> 06:14.400
That's me.

06:14.402 --> 06:16.018
L.A.P.D., sir. We want to talk to you

06:16.020 --> 06:17.770
about your recent flight from New York.

06:17.772 --> 06:19.772
Are you aware that someone
was murdered on that flight

06:19.774 --> 06:21.106
and now he's dead?

06:21.108 --> 06:23.659
We need you to tell us
if you recognize this man.

06:23.661 --> 06:25.027
Hold on.

06:30.785 --> 06:32.084
Oh, that guy?

06:32.086 --> 06:35.671
Whoever killed him deserves an award.

06:35.673 --> 06:37.289
What makes you say that?

06:38.292 --> 06:40.042
I've been saving miles for years now,

06:40.044 --> 06:42.628
commuting back and forth to
New York to see the girlfriend.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.296
I finally get the upgrade.

06:44.298 --> 06:46.015
That's when this jackass steps up

06:46.017 --> 06:48.717
and pays cash for the
last seat in first class.

06:48.719 --> 06:51.937
He actually turned to
me and said, "boo-hoo."

06:53.641 --> 06:55.057
So that's why you killed him.

06:55.943 --> 06:57.359
Believe me...

06:57.361 --> 06:59.311
I would have killed
him, but they don't let.

06:59.313 --> 07:02.698
People in coach kill people in first class.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.033
That's true. That's a rule.

07:04.035 --> 07:05.651
So this is a dead end.

07:05.653 --> 07:06.902
Why don't we get back to the precinct

07:06.904 --> 07:08.153
and see if forensics had better luck?

07:08.155 --> 07:10.456
Thank you for your time, sir.

07:12.410 --> 07:14.460
You're welcome.

07:21.068 --> 07:22.768
I hope you found something
because we have no leads

07:22.770 --> 07:25.070
and the next murder flight
leaves in three hours.

07:25.072 --> 07:27.773
I hope you found something
because we have no leads

07:27.775 --> 07:30.693
and the next murder flight
leaves in three hours.

07:30.695 --> 07:32.027
As a matter of fact, we did.

07:32.029 --> 07:33.329
Dr. Edelweiss?

07:33.331 --> 07:36.665
Ah, detectives. I'll be right with you.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.040
Dr. Scholls,

08:18.042 --> 08:20.325
show the detectives what you showed me.

08:20.327 --> 08:22.407
We found something interesting
in the victim's lungs.

08:24.665 --> 08:25.998
Phew!

08:27.418 --> 08:29.301
Killed by a chicken.

08:29.303 --> 08:30.419
Unlikely.

08:30.421 --> 08:31.970
There were only two
chickens on that flight,

08:31.972 --> 08:33.337
and they both have alibis.

08:33.340 --> 08:36.508
However, these feathers
match exactly the ones found

08:36.510 --> 08:39.595
in an airplane pillow.

08:39.597 --> 08:41.313
The cause of death was asphyxiation,

08:41.315 --> 08:43.849
or smothering in layman's terms.

08:43.851 --> 08:45.350
What does "layman's terms" mean?

08:45.352 --> 08:46.652
So, who's the killer?

08:46.654 --> 08:48.854
Well, perhaps if we test
one of these feathers

08:48.856 --> 08:50.272
in the gas chromatograph,

08:50.274 --> 08:53.325
it may point us to something
the killer was exposed to.

09:11.796 --> 09:14.179
Traces of, um, salbutamol.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.770
And traces of ipratropium bromide...

09:21.772 --> 09:24.973
Chemicals commonly found
in standard inhalers.

09:26.610 --> 09:27.976
Mm.

09:31.065 --> 09:33.782
Your killer's an asthmatic.

09:35.069 --> 09:37.569
The two of you on a
plane cut off from backup?

09:37.571 --> 09:38.904
It's too risky!

09:38.906 --> 09:40.205
You don't even know
what you're looking for.

09:40.207 --> 09:41.790
We know the murderer is asthmatic,

09:41.792 --> 09:43.375
and if the pattern holds, he's gonna kill

09:43.377 --> 09:45.077
another first-class passenger tonight.

09:45.079 --> 09:46.795
Also, I'm really worried about Vivian

09:46.797 --> 09:48.080
on that plane all by herself.

09:48.082 --> 09:49.631
She's a flight attendant.

09:49.633 --> 09:50.916
What's your problem with Vivian?

09:50.918 --> 09:52.968
I'm just so sick of her helpless routine.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.970
You know what I like
about your cousin, Angie?

09:54.972 --> 09:57.055
She's not afraid of
admitting she needs somebody.

09:57.057 --> 09:58.257
Also, amazing breasts.

09:58.259 --> 09:59.892
I felt like that had to be said.

09:59.894 --> 10:02.761
If you kids are finished,
we have a murderer to catch.

10:02.763 --> 10:06.932
You, me, Tanner, and Geils are
going undercover on that flight,

10:06.934 --> 10:10.602
that is, if you two think
you can work together.

10:10.604 --> 10:11.737
Mumble, mumble.

10:11.739 --> 10:13.105
I'm sorry?

10:13.107 --> 10:15.524
I said, "mumble, mumble."

10:15.526 --> 10:17.659
All right.

10:17.661 --> 10:19.995
Let's go stop a murder.

10:23.117 --> 10:24.283
Now?

10:24.285 --> 10:25.450
Wait.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.124
Now.

10:43.487 --> 10:45.604
Pilot. Co-pilot.

10:45.606 --> 10:47.856
- Flight attendant.
- Flight attendant.

10:55.115 --> 10:58.534
43d.

10:58.536 --> 11:02.371
Yes! A row to myself!

11:04.542 --> 11:07.709
43c and "e."

11:07.711 --> 11:09.127
Oh, look who it is.

11:09.129 --> 11:11.797
Grace, Julian, go sit next
to your Uncle Detective.

11:11.799 --> 11:13.549
Here you go.

11:13.551 --> 11:15.634
Grab that for me. Okay.

11:15.636 --> 11:17.553
Uh, yeah, Keith, to the back.

11:17.555 --> 11:18.720
Ben, James.

11:23.194 --> 11:24.943
Can I have a hot towel, please?

11:24.945 --> 11:27.196
Of course, sir.

11:27.198 --> 11:28.864
Thank you.

11:34.905 --> 11:36.488
There is no need to raise your voice.

11:36.490 --> 11:38.290
At me like that, sir.

11:38.292 --> 11:40.909
Now, you may use your leaf blower
when we have reached 10,000 feet

11:40.911 --> 11:42.294
and not a moment before.

11:43.998 --> 11:46.832
If you're not careful,
they'll drive you crazy.

11:46.834 --> 11:49.051
Sometimes, just to amuse myself,

11:49.053 --> 11:51.220
I serve them toilet water.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.389
Here you go, sir.

11:54.391 --> 11:56.842
Mmm, air juice.

12:00.898 --> 12:03.348
I guess we should take off.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.350
I didn't know you could fly a plane.

12:05.352 --> 12:07.769
I can't. I thought you could.

12:08.822 --> 12:11.023
How hard could it be?

12:13.193 --> 12:15.110
How do you fly a 767?

12:15.112 --> 12:17.696
Playing James Taylor,
"You've Got A Friend."

12:17.698 --> 12:19.031
No!

12:21.952 --> 12:24.703
Give it a shot.

12:26.874 --> 12:29.258
Good job, Geils.

12:29.260 --> 12:31.793
You know, this actually might be fun.

12:31.795 --> 12:33.712
What about a little music?

12:33.714 --> 12:34.880
Absolutely.

12:36.216 --> 12:38.634
Play James Taylor's "You've Got A Friend."

12:38.636 --> 12:42.854
The Boeing 767 is one of the
most user-friendly aircraft

12:42.856 --> 12:45.023
in the fleet.

12:48.896 --> 12:50.479
This is your pilot!

12:50.481 --> 12:53.198
It looks like we've reached
our cruising altitude of...

12:53.200 --> 12:54.783
35,000 feet.

12:54.785 --> 12:57.286
Looks like a smooth flight
to New York, so relax,

12:57.288 --> 13:00.822
enjoy the ride, and watch
out for the murderer.

13:03.827 --> 13:04.960
Psst.

13:04.962 --> 13:06.828
It's me.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.413
See anything suspicious?

13:08.415 --> 13:09.381
Negative.

13:09.383 --> 13:11.216
Still on the lookout for an inhaler

13:11.218 --> 13:13.752
and anyone trying to kill
someone with a pillow.

13:13.754 --> 13:15.170
Good thinking.

13:15.172 --> 13:17.673
I'm gonna go study up on
landing before we get there.

13:17.675 --> 13:18.807
Hey, Geils.

13:18.809 --> 13:21.259
Yeah, you need something?

13:22.513 --> 13:23.645
No.

13:23.647 --> 13:25.681
Just be careful.

13:25.683 --> 13:27.316
Will do.

13:29.937 --> 13:31.853
Ohh!

13:35.609 --> 13:38.243
Aah.

13:40.114 --> 13:42.030
Hey!

13:43.083 --> 13:45.200
Never mind.

13:57.631 --> 13:58.964
Excuse me.

13:58.966 --> 14:00.932
Hm? Could I get another diet soda?

14:00.934 --> 14:02.551
Sure thing, sugar blossom.

14:02.553 --> 14:03.602
And can I get the can?

14:03.604 --> 14:05.771
I'm so sorry, sir, but it is our policy

14:05.773 --> 14:07.272
to serve you a small cup of soda

14:07.274 --> 14:09.524
and leave the mostly full can on the cart.

14:09.526 --> 14:10.809
This is B.S.

14:10.811 --> 14:12.861
How come sometimes you get the
can and sometimes you don't?

14:12.863 --> 14:15.280
Sir, I'm gonna ask you not
to use that language with me.

14:15.282 --> 14:17.566
You are in the presence
of a lady, after all.

14:17.568 --> 14:20.035
This is first class, and you're a waitress,

14:20.037 --> 14:22.487
so bring me the can or bring me the pilot.

14:22.489 --> 14:24.122
Sir, I declare you are being

14:24.124 --> 14:26.158
as rude as a crocodile with a bellyache.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.909
Bring me the can, sky whore.

14:29.463 --> 14:31.630
I'll give you the can!
Here's your can! You like it?!

14:31.632 --> 14:33.632
You like that can?!

14:33.634 --> 14:35.717
You got the whole can all to yourself!

14:37.388 --> 14:39.254
Would you be a dear and
hold this for a minute?

14:43.260 --> 14:44.760
It was you, Vivian!

14:44.762 --> 14:46.094
You're the murderer.

14:46.096 --> 14:47.679
These people just have no manners,

14:47.681 --> 14:49.931
and that is something I will not tolerate.

14:49.933 --> 14:52.684
Hand over the pillow, Vivian.

14:52.686 --> 14:53.902
Ohh!

14:55.939 --> 14:58.657
Ohh!

14:59.827 --> 15:02.077
Oh, can I get a blanket, please?

15:02.079 --> 15:03.278
Yes, of course.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.949
Excuse me. I ordered the kosher meal.

15:07.951 --> 15:10.202
Oh, I am so sorry, ma'am.

15:11.922 --> 15:14.372
Excuse me. My movie's not loading.

15:14.374 --> 15:15.674
We had to reset the system.

15:15.676 --> 15:17.175
It's gonna take about 10 minutes, sir.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.428
This is the worst day of my life.

15:20.464 --> 15:23.515
Excuse me. I'm having chest pains.

15:25.436 --> 15:27.102
Clear!

15:29.523 --> 15:31.940
Oh, that's much better. Thank you.

15:39.566 --> 15:40.782
Freeze, Vivian!

15:40.784 --> 15:43.318
Put your hands in the
full upright position!

15:55.999 --> 15:58.500
We'll be right with you.

16:06.927 --> 16:09.177
I spy with my little eye

16:09.179 --> 16:12.764
something that starts with a... "C."

16:12.766 --> 16:14.850
Cloud.

16:14.852 --> 16:16.434
You're good at this.

16:16.436 --> 16:18.403
Tribeca, report in.

16:18.405 --> 16:20.655
It's Vivian! She's the murderer!

16:20.657 --> 16:22.073
She's jealous.

16:22.075 --> 16:23.992
Okay, Tribeca, Vivian's the murderer.

16:23.994 --> 16:25.660
Copy that. Talk to you later.

16:25.662 --> 16:26.945
No, it's true!

16:26.947 --> 16:29.447
She tried to smother a
passenger and used an inhaler.

16:29.449 --> 16:30.916
Oh, my god, what have I done?

16:30.918 --> 16:33.618
Tribeca, hang on. Geils
is gonna back you up.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.420
No! I've got it!

16:35.422 --> 16:37.289
- She's impossible!
- Go!

16:40.043 --> 16:42.878
Try not to be afraid.

18:05.379 --> 18:07.629
Angie Tribeca, open this door right now.

18:07.631 --> 18:08.630
I'm fine.

18:08.632 --> 18:10.599
If you need help, you better say so.

18:10.601 --> 18:13.385
I'm not kidding around. I'm good.

18:13.387 --> 18:15.103
You're skating on thin ice, young lady.

18:15.105 --> 18:16.438
You sure you don't need my help?

18:16.440 --> 18:17.973
Oh, yeah.

18:17.975 --> 18:19.808
That's it. I'm coming in.

18:19.810 --> 18:22.894
Aah!

18:22.896 --> 18:24.279
Vivian, why?!

18:24.281 --> 18:26.865
Because these people are
a bunch of ungrateful pigs!

18:26.867 --> 18:28.450
"Bring me a pillow! Make it hotter!"

18:28.452 --> 18:30.151
Make it colder! Stop
it. You're killing me!"

18:30.153 --> 18:31.369
Oh, blow it out your ass!

18:31.371 --> 18:33.204
Vivian Tribeca, you're under arrest.

18:33.206 --> 18:34.489
Never!

18:35.909 --> 18:37.375
L.A.P.D.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.710
Hang on. Let me get my gun.

18:38.712 --> 18:40.245
That's my gun. I'm cuffing her.

18:40.247 --> 18:41.746
Oh, wait. No, that's my hand.

18:41.748 --> 18:43.748
Who's touching my leg?
Someone is touching my leg.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.750
Sorry.

18:49.006 --> 18:52.057
Yeah, it's a real pay
phone. I'll call you back.

18:52.059 --> 18:54.142
Hey, good work last night.

18:54.144 --> 18:55.760
Oh, you, too.

18:57.064 --> 18:59.264
Let me help you with that.

18:59.266 --> 19:01.483
Sure. That would be nice.

19:03.103 --> 19:05.737
Holy shit! What's in here?
