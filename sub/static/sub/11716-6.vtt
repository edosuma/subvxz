Hey, Jeff.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.731
Oh, hey!
I'm reading to the baby.
You want to read some?

00:22.773 --> 00:23.941
Oh, it's not really
my thing.

00:25.985 --> 00:28.362
Oh, come on.
We could pick
an easier book.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.867
Oh, dagnabbit.
That's a good one.

00:32.908 --> 00:33.951
No, thanks.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.705
The only thing
I want to read is
"drink responsibly"

00:37.746 --> 00:38.831
on the side of my beer can.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.167
Then ignore it.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.044
Come on, just try it.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.173
You didn't listen
to classical music with us.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.466
You won't read to her.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.801
When are you gonna
get involved with our baby?

00:50.843 --> 00:51.802
When it's here,
when we actually have one.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.390
After it burrows its way
out of this whole mess.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.020
I think it's gonna be
just like groundhog day,
you know?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.897
The baby's gonna come out,
take one look at her dad,
and then crawl back in.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.274
I just don't see
why you're doing
all this baby stuff

01:06.316 --> 01:08.443
when it's not even
here yet.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.030
She can hear things,
can't you?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.365
Can't you,
my precious little angel?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.951
I don't think
anyone needs to hear that.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.705
She moved.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.415
You see? She likes it.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.708
I'm thinking
her move was...

02:35.280 --> 02:36.573
Yes, it is you,

02:36.615 --> 02:38.075
despite the fact
that I wrote that article

02:38.117 --> 02:39.827
and gave it to you
for feedback.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.287
Oh, yeah.
I read it. I wasn't a fan.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.920
No, it won't, sir.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.923
For five years,
I've been toiling
in obscurity,

02:52.965 --> 02:55.258
waiting for the day
when I finally
get the credit I deserve.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.511
But instead,
I get this.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.220
I give you credit
all the time.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.098
Name me one instance.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.975
Yesterday.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.518
I cut one in the elevator.
I told everyone it was you.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.271
It wasn't me.

03:09.148 --> 03:11.942
Says he who denied it.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.945
How did my article
get published
with your byline?

03:14.987 --> 03:17.739
Oh, they called me
and asked me
if I had an editorial.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.784
And I looked down,
and yours was
right in the trash.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.371
And you just took
the opportunity

03:24.412 --> 03:26.373
to send it in as your own?

03:26.414 --> 03:28.959
Yes, I sent it in
because my assistant
was nowhere to be found...

03:30.377 --> 03:31.962
Probably loading up
on fiber

03:32.004 --> 03:33.714

That will be all, Timmy.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.768
Hey.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.436
So, Russell,

03:48.478 --> 03:51.023
our wedding is less than
three months away.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.566
Are you gonna let us
use your house
in the Bahamas

03:52.607 --> 03:54.526
for our honeymoon
or what?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.277
Uh, have you considered
my terms?

03:59.447 --> 04:01.324
I'm not up for sharesies
on our wedding night.

04:03.535 --> 04:04.661
How about I fly in
the next night?

04:09.083 --> 04:10.209
No!

04:11.543 --> 04:13.378
Oh, hey.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.338
Nice editorial
in the  Journal by the way.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.508
Oh, yeah, thanks.
I worked really hard on it.
Yeah.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.636
Absolutely deplorable.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.265
Look, the truth
of the matter is,

04:25.306 --> 04:27.350
is that it was
not Mr. Dunbar
who wrote the article.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.228
I wrote it.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.564
Um, I don't think so,
Timmy.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.110
This picture
looks exactly like Russell.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.114
And a little
like Anne Heche.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.202
Acclaimed actress,
sexual boundary pusher...

04:45.244 --> 04:46.411
I'll take it.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.290
Besides, if I didn't
write the article,

04:50.331 --> 04:53.418
then why am I
being asked to speak
at this business seminar?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.837

strategies expo."

04:55.879 --> 04:57.214

a seat, buddy.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.468

how they do it
where you come from...

05:04.679 --> 05:05.597
Yeah.
Okay?

05:06.890 --> 05:08.892
But here,
in this country,

05:08.934 --> 05:10.936
we support our friends
when we do something good.

He didn't do any...

05:14.189 --> 05:15.482
Oh, yeah.

05:15.523 --> 05:16.483
I was the one who...
Here we do it.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.154
Hey.
Hey.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.696
Jeff, Audrey's not with you?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.782
She's up in the apartment
reading to the baby.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.701
Um, but the baby's
still in Brenda.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.621
She thinks you can
bond with the baby
before it's born.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.124
Oh. Well, she's right.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.251
You see,
the final trimester...

05:34.293 --> 05:38.213
A fetus's senses,
including hearing,
are almost fully developed.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.090
I mean, they can be
very receptive
to outside stimulus,

05:40.465 --> 05:41.549
So...

05:45.595 --> 05:47.764
What? I... I read things.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.768
All right.

05:51.810 --> 05:52.644
I saw it on  The Talk.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.190
It's like  The View,
but it's on CBS.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.860
So it can actually work?

05:59.901 --> 06:02.154
Yeah, and it's nice
that Audrey's
getting a head start.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.323
Nice?

06:04.363 --> 06:05.699
Kid's gonna be on her side
before it even comes out.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.328
A mini Audrey.
Mmm.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.165
My worst nightmare.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.876
It's not like you win
any arguments anyway.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.878
That's true.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.379
Imagine a little
micro Audrey
next to her,

06:21.006 --> 06:22.090
cheering her on.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.508
"Yeah, mommy, get him!

06:24.759 --> 06:26.469
"Cut him down!
Nail him, mom."

06:26.511 --> 06:28.138
Whoa, dude.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.514
You looked
just like Chucky
when you did that.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.978
Yeah. Youthful star
of a successful
film franchise...

06:35.603 --> 06:36.771

Everything okay in there?

07:30.325 --> 07:32.035
I'm looking forward
to meeting you.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.122
I have already set up
your 529 plan.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.498
It's a way
to save for college
with some nice tax benefits.

But I don't want
to go to college.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.465

talking to the baby,
trying to bond with it.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.105
Oh, well, then maybe
don't call her "it."

is stupid, really.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.277

08:05.319 --> 08:07.570
I mean, you know,
everything you're saying is,

08:07.612 --> 08:10.449
but when Audrey talks,
she moves.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.284
It's like she's responding
to her voice.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.785
All right.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.413
She has her book.
I've got mine.

the Mookie Wilson story.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.626

really think...

08:21.668 --> 08:23.086
"Chapter one"...
Okay.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.717
So you can
relax in here

08:29.759 --> 08:31.928
until it's time
for you to speak.
All right.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.348
And your speech
is on the teleprompter.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.141
All right. Not too many
big words, right?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.853
It's your article.
They're all your words.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.146
Yeah, 'cause I wrote it.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.401
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.069
Actually, there is.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.491
During my speech,
I'm gonna use
this laser pointer

08:52.532 --> 08:56.328
to highlight a few
specific female members
of the audience.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.662
Those are the ones
I'd like to be brought back

08:57.704 --> 08:58.872
for the after-partay.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.957
Oh.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.792
I guess we can arrange
some sort of meet and greet

09:02.834 --> 09:04.211
after the "Q" and "A".

09:04.252 --> 09:05.586

Here's an idea.

What if they don't ask me
questions?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.535
That might be fun.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.249
Oh, we could go
see the new  James Bond
movie at 7:40.

Would you stop that?

caught one yet.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.799

10:05.522 --> 10:06.898

and guile."

10:19.119 --> 10:20.370
He wants us to go
be in the audience

10:20.412 --> 10:21.662

10:21.704 --> 10:22.705
Oh, give me the phone.
Here.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.711
So, um, we'd be happy
to help you out

10:28.753 --> 10:30.046
if you help us out
with our honeymoon.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.090
No, not like that.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.927
We want your house
in the Bahamas.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.805
Nice doing
business with you.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.311
Why don't you
open your mouth.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.065
"Chapter four...

10:51.734 --> 10:54.070

as the tidewater tides

"because it was old
and rusty."
Okay! Okay.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.372
You know what?

11:04.414 --> 11:05.873
This isn't working.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.917
The baby hasn't moved once.
She hates this.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.919
We hate this.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.509
I feel so stupid
reading to your big,
fat belly.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.805
Eh, just sustaining
the life of your child,
but whatever.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.975
Look, Jeff, if you
don't want to do this,
you don't have to.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.602
It just doesn't make
any sense.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.812
It's just another
of those stupid ideas
that Audrey latches onto,

11:27.854 --> 11:29.230
like when she decided
to compost

11:29.272 --> 11:30.565
and we had
a bucket of worms

11:30.607 --> 11:32.400
sitting on the counter
for a month.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.069
She moved.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.449
Really?
Yeah.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.369
Look at that.
I made her move.
What did I say?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.829
(LAUGHING) I don't know...
You were just bitching
about Audrey.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.458
Maybe the baby likes that.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.254
I'm sure
it was just a coincidence.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.673
Let's find out.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.761
Last year, we threw $800
at your mother's
knitting hobby.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.222
You know what we have
to show for it?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.517
One sock that doesn't fit
in a shoe.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.439
She's dancing in there.
Can you cancel
your dinner plans?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.485
Can you seriously complain
about Audrey for that long?

12:15.527 --> 12:17.237
Oh, please,
the challenge will
be getting it all in

12:17.278 --> 12:18.488
before the kid arrives.

12:27.205 --> 12:33.002
So, next year,
I see a definite return
of about 6.5% to 7.5%

12:33.044 --> 12:35.505
on income-producing
commercial properties.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.673
So, in conclusion...

12:38.717 --> 12:40.218
This one here.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.221
This one on the end.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.391
And I'd like some of that.
All right?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.602
Okay.

12:48.643 --> 12:49.768
Thank you.
Peace!

12:51.187 --> 12:52.731
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

12:55.108 --> 12:57.860
Mr. Dunbar will now
take your questions.

12:57.902 --> 13:01.239
Okay, here we go.
Random person. Uh...

13:01.281 --> 13:02.323
You, sir, back there.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.579
Mr. Dunbar...

13:07.621 --> 13:10.123
I understand that
in five years,
you'll be 40.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.251
Why, thank you.
Yes, I will.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.044
Great question.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.422
Any other questions?
Anyone? Anyone at all?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.339
Mr. Dunbar, please.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.301
How about you back there
in the fun top?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.262
Sparkles. (CHUCKLES)

13:24.304 --> 13:27.140
Mr. Dunbar,
would it be okay
if I showed you my...

13:27.181 --> 13:28.266
Nope.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.772
Given the current
economic volatility

13:33.812 --> 13:36.441
in countries
such as Spain and Greece,

13:36.483 --> 13:39.110
I'd like to know...
Are you single?

13:42.280 --> 13:45.533
Well, yes, woman who
should be selling it
a little more,

13:45.575 --> 13:46.785
I am single.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.620
(GROANS)

13:51.247 --> 13:53.040
Come on!

13:53.082 --> 13:55.084
No, it's good.
You got picked
for the after-party.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.671
Oh, see if you can get
a plus-one.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.301
Oh, oh.

14:03.343 --> 14:08.055
So I'll be in my chair
and all comfy watching TV,
without fail...

14:08.097 --> 14:09.808
"Jeff, can you
come in here?

14:09.848 --> 14:12.977
"We need to discuss
something unimportant
that can absolutely wait."

14:16.564 --> 14:18.525
"Oh, I'm Audrey.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.986
"What would I rather have,
$800 or a closet full
of yarn?"

14:25.740 --> 14:27.200
Jeff.
Hold on,
I'm on a roll here.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.494
Here's a little tip.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.204
Don't ever ask your mom
"How was your day?"

14:31.245 --> 14:32.539
Unless you've got
an hour to kill.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.499
Jeff.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.549
How was your day?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.595
What you've heard is true.

14:47.637 --> 14:52.308
For some women,
the satisfaction I provide
is almost too intense.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.817
(SIGHS) This better be
one hell of a beach house.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.485
Well, I feel like
we're done here.

15:02.527 --> 15:06.030
No, we're not.
I have a question.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.700
Mr. Dunbar, the premise
of your article

15:08.742 --> 15:11.619
seems to be
that the New York market
can withstand

15:11.661 --> 15:13.747
the fluctuations
and vagaries of
the foreign market.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.248
Yeah.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.252
How is this affected
by falling interest rates?

15:21.003 --> 15:24.298
It's nice to get
an intelligent
question finally.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.593
I'm talking
to you two bozos
in the back.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.179
Yes, I do know a ton
about real estate.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.472
I made a killing
when I sold

15:31.514 --> 15:33.558
my Bahamas beach house
two years ago.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.436
Oh, come on!

15:36.477 --> 15:38.271
What about
the after-party?

15:39.564 --> 15:42.233
Mr. Dunbar,
can you answer the query?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.069
(LAUGHING)
You hear that, Tim?
She called you a query.

15:46.905 --> 15:51.117
Frankly, Mr. Dunbar,
I see no reason
to continue,

15:51.158 --> 15:53.828
as you've made a mockery
of this entire evening.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.081
I hear what
you're saying. I do.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.958
And, uh...
I'll tell you what.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.293
There you go.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.588
You earned it.
Come on!

16:05.506 --> 16:07.258
So you finally decide
to bond with our baby,

16:07.300 --> 16:08.760
and you do it
by insulting me?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.974
Maybe try reading to her.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.601
I did.
Ha, well, he did.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.395
Mookie Wilson?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.316
Nice choice for a baby.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.611
Oh, I'm sorry,
how many world series rings
does Dinky Winky Bunny have?

16:28.613 --> 16:30.949
How would you like it
if I did it to you, huh?

16:30.990 --> 16:34.243
(DEEP VOICE) "Hi, I'm Jeff.
Feed me and give me sex."

16:34.285 --> 16:37.288
Oh, she knows what I want.
How come I never get it?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.751
Heads up, kid.
Don't play Daddy's
"pull my finger" game.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.461
Don't you dare ruin that
for me.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.173
Ruin? It's disgusting.
It's a fun game.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.300
I make it seem like
one thing's connected
to the other.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.301
That's all I'm gonna say.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.220
Here's a little secret.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.223
If you don't
pull Daddy's finger,
he's gonna do it anyway.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.684
Am not.
Are too.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.727
Oh, God,
what am I doing?

16:59.769 --> 17:02.188
You're acting crazy,
and you're making me
act crazy.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.398
Speaking of things
that are gonna
happen anyway...

17:06.442 --> 17:08.194
Come on, what is this
really about?

17:08.235 --> 17:09.570
You want me to do
all this baby stuff.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.031
That baby's
not even here yet.
We're not ready.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.742
She's gonna be here
in less than two months.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.910
Please tell me
you're close to ready.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.955
I'm in the ballpark.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.748
(SIGHS)

17:20.790 --> 17:22.876
All right, babe.
You know what?

17:22.917 --> 17:24.002
I don't know
if I'm ready either.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.920
Really?

17:25.962 --> 17:29.423
Okay, just to be clear here,
one of you has to take her.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.265
Look, I don't know if
you can ever really be ready
for a baby.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.767
You know,
but we got to figure
this thing out together,

17:39.809 --> 17:41.019
as a team.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.439
Sorry I said all that stuff
about you to our kid.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.357
You know
I think you're solid.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.026
Sure.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.152
Romance,
time of death...

17:50.570 --> 17:51.654
8:17.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.950
We've developed
a shorthand.
It's fine.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.744
Look, let's make a deal
never to fight
in front of the baby.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.496
We have to remain
a united front,

18:00.538 --> 18:01.622
because she
could divide us.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.291
Oh, yeah.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.044
Yeah, babies have ruined
far better couples than us.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.882
Wait. There are
better couples than you?

18:10.924 --> 18:11.966
Oh.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.845
You stay out of this.

18:15.887 --> 18:17.805
And you, you...

18:17.847 --> 18:19.640
You are not
gonna divide us,
little girl.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.725
We're onto your game.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.311
But we're smarter than you.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.190
Mmm. It's a lot closer
than it should be.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.030
Hey, hey, Tim!

18:34.072 --> 18:36.657
Boss man did okay
up there, huh?

18:36.699 --> 18:38.910
Well, if your goal was
to make me feel betrayed

18:38.952 --> 18:41.704
and utterly underappreciated,
then, yes, you did okay.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.958
Look, I know
what you're trying to say,

18:44.999 --> 18:48.461
and I'd love to get you
in the after-party,
but I don't think I can.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.463
Honestly,
they're super tight
with the list.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.839
Tim, wait.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.094
What do you want me to say...
I'm sorry I stole
your article?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.345
Yes.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.555
And it was
a selfish thing to do?

18:59.597 --> 19:01.474
Yes.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.435
And maybe I did it
because I'm threatened
about how smart you are?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.064
You really
feel that way, sir?

19:08.106 --> 19:10.775
No, I'm just asking
if that's one of the things
you want me to say.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.069
Excuse me, Mr. Dunbar.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.737
I never got a chance
to ask my question
about your article.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.030
Okay, yeah.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.993
You know what?
Ask this guy.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.161
He wrote the article...

19:23.037 --> 19:24.288
Every word.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.125
Well, thank you, sir.
I appreciate that.

19:28.709 --> 19:32.379
Now...you have
a question for me.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.591
Well, all your estimates
are based on a fixed value
for the euro,

19:35.633 --> 19:39.345
but given
the current volatility
of the European market,

19:39.386 --> 19:41.722
doesn't that make
all your findings
completely irrelevant?

19:43.557 --> 19:44.809
Gut punch.

19:47.561 --> 19:51.065
(CLEARING THROAT)
Well, uh, that certainly is
an interesting point

19:51.107 --> 19:53.151
that you raise.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.612
I think, uh, what I was
trying to get at was, um...

19:57.237 --> 19:58.322
Mr. Dunbar?

20:00.908 --> 20:03.285
To be honest, Tim,
I had the same question.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.206
Excuse me.
Oh, thank God.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.749
I heard something
about an after-party.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.292
Oh, yeah, you did.
Come along, now.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.714
Ah, let me know
how that turns out, guys.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.848
Is it true you're the third
fastest man in the world?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.224
(CHUCKLES)  Guilty.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.602
But not when it counts.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.689
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
No, not when it counts.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.609
Is it true
that you were
on SEAL Team 6?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.863
Ooh. I...

20:38.905 --> 20:40.948
Am not at liberty
to comment on that.
