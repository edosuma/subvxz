[yawns softly]

00:19.287 --> 00:20.788
[snoring]

00:20.871 --> 00:23.207
[mutters] Oh, God.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.458
Oh, God.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.688
[grunts]

00:45.771 --> 00:47.606
[inhales deeply] Hey.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.483
- Hi. Morning.
- Hi.

00:49.567 --> 00:50.734
[Gus sniffles]

00:51.652 --> 00:53.487
[grunting and sighing]

00:54.071 --> 00:55.071
Oh, my God.

00:55.114 --> 00:56.949
I just had the weirdest dream.

00:58.116 --> 01:00.035
I dreamt that I killed Osama bin Laden.

01:00.911 --> 01:03.497
And then, like,
when I went to look at the body...

01:03.581 --> 01:05.498
- it was Macaulay Culkin.
- Hmm.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.461
- What do you think that means?
- I don't know.

01:08.544 --> 01:13.341
Maybe, like, deep down, Osama bin Laden
was just a scared little boy?

01:13.424 --> 01:14.550
[both chuckle]

01:14.633 --> 01:16.945
Or maybe he'd still be alive
if he'd booby-trapped his house

01:16.969 --> 01:18.345
<i>à la Home Alone.</i>

01:18.429 --> 01:19.722
[chuckling] Right.

01:19.805 --> 01:22.015
Yeah, if he'd just left out
some Micro Machines,

01:22.099 --> 01:24.059
SEAL Team Six would have slipped on 'em.

01:24.142 --> 01:25.269
- Shit.
- What?

01:25.353 --> 01:26.413
- [Mickey sighs]
- What's up?

01:26.437 --> 01:28.439
Nothing. I wanted to go
to a meeting this morning,

01:28.522 --> 01:30.399
- and I already missed it. [sighs]
- Oh.

01:30.483 --> 01:33.569
[stammers] What,
the sex and love addicts...

01:33.652 --> 01:35.821
Yeah... [chuckles]

01:35.904 --> 01:37.781
- Already fucking up.
- Oh.

01:38.532 --> 01:42.203
Well, can you go to another one?
Maybe a later one or something?

01:42.286 --> 01:45.206
Yeah, I think there's an eleven o'clock.
I could go to that.

01:45.289 --> 01:46.374
- Mmm-hmm.
- [sniffs]

01:46.457 --> 01:50.168
- I smell like BO and tacos.
- What's wrong with that?

01:50.252 --> 01:51.629
Could I take a shower here?

01:51.712 --> 01:53.922
I don't wanna walk into a meeting
smelling like this.

01:54.006 --> 01:55.591
Oh, yeah, sure.

02:00.137 --> 02:02.097
[stammers] You know what?
Maybe, um...

02:02.180 --> 02:06.310
Maybe I'll go get some coffees...
just to let you have your space.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.395
- Okay?
- Cool.

02:07.478 --> 02:11.399
I'll make sure to turn off that spy cam
in the shower, too.

02:14.109 --> 02:16.153
That was a little creepy. I'm sorry.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.363
Okay.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.919
[yawning] Oh, shit.

02:47.184 --> 02:49.520
- Charlie, what up?
- Hello, Gus.

02:58.362 --> 02:59.738
Hey!

03:00.823 --> 03:02.366
I'm back.

03:02.450 --> 03:06.078
Um, there was only one towel in there.

03:06.161 --> 03:09.164
Oh, yeah. Um, Natalie got all the others.

03:09.247 --> 03:11.041
- You only own one towel?
- Yup.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.918
Big red. [chuckles]

03:13.001 --> 03:16.547
So you have one towel
and three half-empty bottles of shampoo?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.549
I have very particular hair.

03:19.091 --> 03:20.926
My mom says I look like Michael Landon.

03:21.885 --> 03:23.053
I don't know who that is.

03:23.137 --> 03:26.098
He's, uh, Pa?
<i>Little House on the Prairie?</i>

03:26.682 --> 03:28.309
- Never watched that.
- Mmm.

03:29.435 --> 03:31.312
People also tell me
I look like Rachel Maddow,

03:31.395 --> 03:33.397
which I take as a huge compliment.

03:33.481 --> 03:36.067
I would. Can I borrow a T-shirt?

03:36.149 --> 03:38.360
Yeah, they're in the dresser there.

03:38.444 --> 03:39.695
Uh, top left-hand drawer.

03:39.778 --> 03:43.407
To the right of that are sort of,
like, polo shirts, and then...

03:43.490 --> 03:45.367
If you're feeling a little cold,

03:45.451 --> 03:48.287
you can do a sweater
or sweatshirt situation.

03:48.370 --> 03:50.706
- That's to the right. And... okay.
- Found one.

03:50.789 --> 03:51.790
Hey, perfect.

03:51.874 --> 03:54.502
- [Mickey] All right, I gotta go.
- Awesome.

03:54.585 --> 03:57.630
So, um, when do you want
to hang out again?

03:57.713 --> 03:59.298
Um... [sighs]

04:00.132 --> 04:02.301
I... I feel like we should...

04:03.677 --> 04:04.762
take a pause.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.347
Even if we're not hooking up,

04:06.430 --> 04:09.141
I think it's better for me
if I don't couple up right now.

04:09.224 --> 04:11.018
Yeah, no. Totally. Of course.

04:11.101 --> 04:13.312
Um... [smacks lips] So...

04:13.396 --> 04:14.522
Sure.

04:14.605 --> 04:18.526
Yeah, so maybe touch base
in, like... a week?

04:19.442 --> 04:21.194
A week, great. Yeah.

04:21.278 --> 04:22.922
I was gonna say that.
I was gonna say a week.

04:22.946 --> 04:24.156
So that's perfect.

04:24.239 --> 04:26.241
And does that mean we're, uh...

04:26.324 --> 04:28.619
- Are we texting during that time?
- [takes deep breath]

04:28.702 --> 04:30.871
- I don't think texting is a good idea.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:30.954 --> 04:33.290
As you know,
I can go a little crazy with the texting.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.794
So let's keep that
to an emergency-only situation.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.504
Okay, yeah.

04:38.587 --> 04:40.273
- If I get hit by a bus, I'll text you.
- Yeah.

04:40.297 --> 04:42.174
- Don't call 911.
- No.

04:42.257 --> 04:45.511
Just text me an emoji of a sad face
and a hospital, and...

04:45.594 --> 04:46.595
Great.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.182
- [sighs]
- [keys jangling]

04:52.976 --> 04:53.977
What a night we had.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.939
Yeah. Hey, we didn't fuck!

05:01.610 --> 05:03.571
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

05:03.654 --> 05:05.572
- See ya!
- Thanks for the coffee.

05:05.656 --> 05:08.534
Of course, yeah.
Now, let me get the door for you.

05:08.617 --> 05:10.619
- [grunts lightly]
- Okay. Bye.

05:14.998 --> 05:16.374
[sighs]

05:16.459 --> 05:17.960
[farting]

05:19.211 --> 05:20.295
[sighs]

05:21.171 --> 05:23.173
[theme music playing]

05:40.983 --> 05:43.986
[Mickey] Hi, I'm Mickey.
I'm a sex and love addict.

05:44.069 --> 05:45.362
[people in group] Hi, Mickey.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.866
So there's this guy that I like.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.450
I do. I like him.

05:50.534 --> 05:54.037
Uh, and I slept at his place last night,

05:54.121 --> 05:55.789
but we didn't do anything.

05:56.707 --> 05:57.708
We didn't have sex.

05:57.791 --> 06:01.211
We just talked and laughed
and whatever.

06:01.294 --> 06:06.550
Uh, the point is we didn't do anything,
and I feel really good about that.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.595
And I want to keep taking things slowly.

06:10.596 --> 06:11.722
But...

06:12.681 --> 06:14.141
if I'm honest with myself,

06:14.224 --> 06:17.310
what I really wanna do
is just text him right now

06:17.394 --> 06:20.022
and try and hang out with him all day.
[chuckles]

06:20.105 --> 06:24.359
Like, uh, my neighbor
is having this dinner party thing later,

06:24.442 --> 06:27.404
and I just really, really wish
I could bring him with me.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.489
But...

06:29.114 --> 06:33.368
I am trying to do things
differently this time

06:33.451 --> 06:37.205
and just hope that it turns out...

06:38.707 --> 06:39.833
okay.

06:39.917 --> 06:41.293
I don't know.

06:48.050 --> 06:50.093
[whirring softly]

06:54.223 --> 06:55.724
[thudding]

06:58.518 --> 07:00.103
[whirring stops]

07:03.941 --> 07:05.233
[Chris sing-song] There he is!

07:05.317 --> 07:07.695
Mr. Balcony!

07:07.778 --> 07:09.780
- Morning, Chris. How's it going?
- [laughs]

07:09.863 --> 07:12.533
- This is your shoe, I assume.
- [normal] Yeah. [laughs]

07:12.616 --> 07:15.035
- That's a good system.
- I call it the "rude awakening."

07:15.118 --> 07:17.579
- You could have just texted me.
- You live right here.

07:17.663 --> 07:19.790
What would you rather have,
a text or a shoe?

07:19.873 --> 07:22.292
Yeah, I'd take a text, too. Whatever.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.020
How did it end up
with that girl last night?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.964
She get out of here, or did you guys...
Did you hit that?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.256
Oh, um...

07:29.174 --> 07:31.552
I could come over
so we don't have to be yelling this.

07:31.635 --> 07:33.011
I can hear you. Did you fuck?

07:33.095 --> 07:36.181
Uh, no, we didn't...
Uh, she just spent the night.

07:36.265 --> 07:38.517
- Oh.
- Yeah. It was really a fun time.

07:38.601 --> 07:40.644
We just talked and hung out,
and it was fun.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.104
Cool.

07:42.187 --> 07:45.315
- What are you doing tonight?
- [puffs] Absolutely nothing.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.441
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:46.524 --> 07:47.525
You wanna hang out?

07:47.609 --> 07:50.904
- Get some buddies together? Go to a bar?
- Yeah! Are you kidding me?

07:50.988 --> 07:53.073
I got money from both my grandmas
for my birthday.

07:53.156 --> 07:54.617
So I'm ready to spend, baby.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.300
Let's keep in touch. I'll see you later?

07:56.368 --> 07:57.452
Hey, my shoe.

07:57.535 --> 07:59.037
Oh! Yes, of course.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.082
[Chris grunts]

08:03.000 --> 08:04.960
- It's all right. I'll get it.
- Okay.

08:05.043 --> 08:06.763
[Chris] Hey,
there's another one down there!

08:15.596 --> 08:18.682
- Hey! How was last night?
- Um...

08:20.017 --> 08:21.101
Crazy.

08:21.184 --> 08:24.521
I ended up spending the night
at Gus' and, uh...

08:25.438 --> 08:26.732
it's, uh...

08:26.815 --> 08:29.610
It's a long story.
How're things with Randy?

08:29.693 --> 08:31.987
Good. We had sex three times last night.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.446
- Wow!
- Yeah.

08:33.530 --> 08:36.909
He's actually very virile.
You might not think that looking at him,

08:36.991 --> 08:39.910
because he's a little on the heavy side,

08:39.995 --> 08:43.248
but underneath the weight,
he's in very good shape.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.501
What are you up to tonight?

08:46.584 --> 08:48.962
Supposed to go to Syd's
for this dinner party.

08:49.046 --> 08:50.964
- Fun.
- Eh, maybe. I don't know.

08:51.048 --> 08:54.676
It's gonna be me and three couples.
I don't like being the seventh wheel.

08:56.219 --> 08:59.306
- Do you want to come with me?
- Oh, I'd love to,

08:59.389 --> 09:02.434
but I'm gonna go see a girl
from work's band play.

09:02.517 --> 09:04.978
They do ska.
Maybe you could ask Gus.

09:05.062 --> 09:08.606
I don't think it's a good idea
for me to hang out with him all the time.

09:08.691 --> 09:09.775
Why?

09:10.818 --> 09:12.485
'Cause I'm a sex and love addict.

09:12.569 --> 09:13.696
Okay.

09:14.612 --> 09:17.741
And I'm an alcoholic,
which you may have already guessed.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.202
[stammers] Right.

09:20.285 --> 09:24.497
I want you to know that I'm not currently
engaging in any of that behavior,

09:24.581 --> 09:26.416
even the sex and love stuff.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.584
Um...

09:28.501 --> 09:31.171
I just... thought I should tell you.

09:31.254 --> 09:33.757
- Wow, this is a lot to take in. Um...
- Yeah. [chuckles]

09:33.841 --> 09:35.968
Well, I want you to know that I, um...

09:36.051 --> 09:39.429
[stutters] I'm here for you,
whatever you might need.

09:40.097 --> 09:42.015
- I'm here for you.
- Thank you.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.267
Thank you. I just...

09:44.351 --> 09:46.394
- I thought you should know.
- [sighs]

09:46.478 --> 09:47.980
Yeah. I mean, uh...

09:48.063 --> 09:50.816
I know this is very much about you,
but can I just say...

09:50.899 --> 09:54.069
I'm just, like...
vibrating with this news.

09:54.152 --> 09:55.904
- [chuckles]
- Look at my hand! It's like...

09:55.987 --> 09:58.883
I thought I was doing something wrong.
That's why we weren't getting along.

09:58.907 --> 10:03.412
No! No, no, no, no. This is all on me.
I'm kind of a fuck-up.

10:03.495 --> 10:05.455
This feels really good to know this.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.874
This conversation is very freeing.
[chuckles]

10:07.958 --> 10:09.835
Um, so have you told anybody else?

10:09.918 --> 10:11.336
Just Gus.

10:11.419 --> 10:13.338
- So, no other female friends?
- No.

10:13.421 --> 10:14.422
Oh...

10:18.426 --> 10:19.970
I cut up a rabbit once.

10:20.971 --> 10:21.972
What?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.933
When I was eight,
I found a dead rabbit in the yard,

10:25.016 --> 10:29.271
and I picked it up with a plastic bag,
and then I cut it into small pieces,

10:29.354 --> 10:32.274
and I put the pieces
in a bowl in the shed.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.611
[takes deep breath]
I'm gonna get ready for Syd's now.

10:36.694 --> 10:38.070
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:38.155 --> 10:41.324
- Great. Okay. [grunts] Stupid skirt.
- Um, Mickey?

10:41.408 --> 10:43.911
- Yeah.
- The rabbit thing?

10:43.994 --> 10:46.288
I... I wasn't eight. I was 23.

10:54.963 --> 10:57.132

12:15.377 --> 12:17.004
[Syd] Hey!

12:17.087 --> 12:19.923
- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank you for having me.

12:20.423 --> 12:22.109
- [Gus] So, if on <i>Friends...</i>
- [Chris] Mmm-hmm.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.093
Ross references <i>Die Hard,</i>

12:24.177 --> 12:28.015
that means in the <i>Friends</i> universe
<i>Die Hard</i> exists as a movie.

12:28.098 --> 12:29.182
- Right?
- Right.

12:29.266 --> 12:30.642
- Okay.
- [Justin] I hear that.

12:30.725 --> 12:35.021
So when later Bruce Willis shows up
as Ross' girlfriend's dad

12:35.105 --> 12:36.649
- on the show <i>Friends...</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

12:36.731 --> 12:38.984
why aren't all the friends like,

12:39.067 --> 12:40.777
"Holy shit!

12:40.860 --> 12:44.238
This guy looks like Bruce Willis
from the movie <i>Die Hard.</i>

12:44.322 --> 12:47.910
I wanna fucking kill myself
from the shock!"

12:47.993 --> 12:50.787
Gus, I think you spend a lot of time
thinking about <i>Friends.</i>

12:50.871 --> 12:53.248
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't talk about it.

12:53.331 --> 12:54.374
[all chuckling]

12:54.457 --> 12:56.960
- [Justin] I don't know.
- [Wade] We don't talk about <i>Friends.</i>

12:57.043 --> 12:59.880
I still don't understand.
I don't know. I stopped listening.

12:59.963 --> 13:01.840
- [all laughing]
- [Gus] I'm just saying,

13:01.923 --> 13:06.219
I wish TV shows and movies
just obeyed those rules a little bit.

13:06.303 --> 13:08.889
Why are you talking quieter?
Did somebody ground you?

13:08.972 --> 13:10.807
Are you grounded? Is your mom here?

13:10.890 --> 13:12.767
- No, am I talking quieter?
- Mama Gus!

13:12.850 --> 13:14.102
[all laughing]

13:14.186 --> 13:18.982
I guess I just, uh, became self-aware
of how dorky this conversation is,

13:19.066 --> 13:21.776
and I don't want anybody
to overhear us, so...

13:21.860 --> 13:23.778
Those girls can't hear you!
It doesn't matter.

13:23.861 --> 13:26.364
- Oh, we can hear you.
- [men laughing]

13:26.448 --> 13:28.575
Yeah, it's the dorkiest conversation ever.

13:28.658 --> 13:29.867
[men laughing]

13:29.952 --> 13:31.995
Just when you think
you're gonna get out of it,

13:32.079 --> 13:33.538
you go deeper!

13:33.622 --> 13:37.417
Do we... do we at least sound smart?
Like, do we sound like smart nerds?

13:37.500 --> 13:38.853
- Don't get me wrong.
- [Chris] No?

13:38.877 --> 13:43.298
I am always up for talking about <i>Friends.</i>
I've watched every episode 500 times.

13:43.381 --> 13:46.551
Oh, I love it! Maybe you guys
should come over here and join us.

13:46.634 --> 13:47.945
You know what you're talking about.

13:47.969 --> 13:50.180
- [woman] Oh, I know.
- Make this conversation cooler!

13:50.263 --> 13:51.889
- Cool chicks!
- We're doing this?

13:51.974 --> 13:53.350
Yeah. Okay, then.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.793
Hey, this is, uh, Randy and Wade.
This is Justin right here.

13:55.852 --> 13:57.395
- Hi.
- What up?

13:57.479 --> 13:59.522
- This is Gus. I'm Chris!
- Hello, hi.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.233
- Hi, I'm Lauren.
- 'Sup, Lauren?

14:01.316 --> 14:02.859
- I'm Kali.
- Hi!

14:02.942 --> 14:05.278
I'm wondering, are we allowed
to talk about things

14:05.362 --> 14:08.573
other than continuity errors
in our favorite '90s sitcoms?

14:09.782 --> 14:11.243
[Justin] I think so.

14:11.326 --> 14:12.970
I don't think we've tackled
<i>Dharma and Greg.</i>

14:12.994 --> 14:14.579
Oh, that's a good one.

14:14.663 --> 14:18.083
[Kali] I always notice...
I always notice stuff...

14:18.166 --> 14:21.104
[Syd] There are companies that will come
and clean out the diapers for you.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.671
But, of course,
his mom wanted me to do it myself.

14:23.755 --> 14:27.300
- [Shaun] Why? Why would she want that?
- Because she did it herself.

14:27.384 --> 14:30.720
So, tell me if this is super obnoxious,
but Harrison's about to turn one.

14:30.804 --> 14:34.182
- Can I ask you about preschools?
- [Syd] Yes, definitely. Now is the time.

14:34.265 --> 14:35.350
- It gets cutthroat.
- Yeah.

14:35.433 --> 14:38.395
Yeah, we were filling out applications
when Liz was in her third trimester.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.606
Yeah, we were filling out forms
for preschool before we met.

14:41.689 --> 14:43.169
- [Shaun] Oh, my God.
- [all laughing]

14:44.442 --> 14:46.444
What about the Center for Early Education?

14:46.528 --> 14:48.381
- You guys have Otis there?
- That's where Otis goes.

14:48.405 --> 14:51.533
We can't say enough good things about it.
They have a garden.

14:51.616 --> 14:54.744
- The kids grow tomatoes, cucumbers...
- [Jeff] Mmm-hmm.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.872
He's into eating salad now.
Tell 'em what he said the other day.

14:57.955 --> 14:59.582
He said, "I wanna be a kale farmer."

14:59.666 --> 15:02.544
- [indistinct chatter]
- What?

15:02.627 --> 15:04.507
Did you hear about
that police chase last night?

15:04.587 --> 15:06.798
I was at the Springwood,
and the cops showed up...

15:06.881 --> 15:08.258
I'm so sorry. Hold on, Mickey.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.069
What's the one where they learn
at their individual paces?

15:10.093 --> 15:11.719
- Waldorf. Waldorf.
- [Liz] Waldorf.

15:11.803 --> 15:13.263
You don't wanna go to Waldorf.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.223
They don't want any brands or labels.

15:15.306 --> 15:18.267
So, if your kid wears
a Disney character T-shirt, they will...

15:18.351 --> 15:20.728
- send them home.
- And it's to the firing squad.

15:20.812 --> 15:22.980
They have a little preschool firing squad.

15:23.064 --> 15:26.317
So, we're at East Side Family School.
Very progressive.

15:26.401 --> 15:29.487
They let the kids run around barefoot.
And they have chickens.

15:29.571 --> 15:31.573
So I get to pay $20,000 a year

15:31.656 --> 15:34.076
for my kid to run around
in chicken shit and parasites?

15:34.159 --> 15:35.886
When we were going to school,
it was free. [chuckles]

15:35.910 --> 15:37.662
- [all talking indistinctly]
- [Syd] Stop.

15:37.745 --> 15:39.974
[Liz] There are not parasites.
There are Purell stations.

15:39.998 --> 15:42.000
- [Brian] Oh, okay.
- [Shaun] You guys vaccinate?

15:42.083 --> 15:43.752
[Syd] Oh, my God. Of course. We do.

15:43.835 --> 15:46.088
But it doesn't mean my kid's
not gonna get whooping cough

15:46.171 --> 15:48.798
because every other parent
in this city is a selfish idiot.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.484
[Liz] Can you imagine
not caring and being, like,

15:50.508 --> 15:53.136
"I'm just not gonna vaccinate my kid.
Let everyone else suffer"?

15:53.219 --> 15:57.098
This is going to blow your mind. You know
what we're dealing with now? Pinworms.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.016
- Eww. No. [laughing]
- Yuck.

15:59.101 --> 16:01.269
- Ugh.
- [Syd laughing]

16:01.352 --> 16:03.021
- [Lorna] So terrible.
- Guys!

16:03.104 --> 16:04.856
What if we played TableTopics?

16:04.939 --> 16:07.234
Pinworms ruin... I ruin...
It's ruining my life...

16:07.317 --> 16:09.194
I don't wanna talk about pinworms.

16:09.277 --> 16:12.864
I wanna play TableTopics.
Come on, enough about the worms!

16:12.947 --> 16:14.991
[all speaking indistinctly]

16:15.533 --> 16:18.536
- [music playing]
- Who's thirsty?

16:18.620 --> 16:20.538
[all cheering]

16:21.456 --> 16:23.541
So, what else keeps you up at night?

16:23.625 --> 16:25.710
Well, Uber mostly,
'cause I do it part-time.

16:25.794 --> 16:29.589
And club promoting.
I promote all over the East Side.

16:29.672 --> 16:31.216
- [Lauren] Oh, yeah?
- Hell yeah.

16:31.299 --> 16:33.760
- Is this a job interview?
- What do you do?

16:33.843 --> 16:35.443
- I want to know.
- [Wade] I'm an editor.

16:35.470 --> 16:37.222
What shows do you work on?

16:37.305 --> 16:38.681
- <i>Swamp Ghosts.</i>
- [Chris] Whoa!

16:38.765 --> 16:40.267
- <i>Swamp Ghosts?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:40.350 --> 16:41.952
- I like <i>Swamp Ghosts.</i>
- [Chris] Such a badass show.

16:41.976 --> 16:44.479
- I'll give you an autograph later.
- Okay.

16:44.562 --> 16:47.064
- I don't have a job.
- [Lauren] Oh...

16:47.149 --> 16:48.525
I was gonna ask him.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.110
- [all chuckle]
- That's crazy.

16:50.193 --> 16:54.030
Um, steakhouse waiter/
stuntman/entrepreneur.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.033
- [Lauren] Whoa.
- Slash, just bought a drone, so...

16:57.117 --> 16:58.118
[chuckles]

16:58.201 --> 17:00.328
[Randy] That's not a job. That's a hobby.

17:00.411 --> 17:02.122
[Justin] You guys are hilarious.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.249
Hey.

17:04.332 --> 17:05.666
- Hey!
- Hi.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.502
- What's up?
- Nothing. [chuckles]

17:08.586 --> 17:09.587
How's it going?

17:09.671 --> 17:11.047
- It's going all right.
- Good.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.092
So, I dunno. [stammers]
What do you do?

17:14.175 --> 17:16.844
Oh, uh, I'm an on-set teacher.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.637
- All right.
- Tutor. Yeah, yeah.

17:18.721 --> 17:20.097
I work on the show <i>Witchita.</i>

17:20.182 --> 17:21.683
Oh, my God.

17:21.766 --> 17:23.435
- [stammers] You know it?
- Yes!

17:23.518 --> 17:26.938
- You're a fan?
- Well, we love to hate-watch that show.

17:27.021 --> 17:29.232
- Oh, cool. Cool.
- Yeah.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.235
Yeah, it's the most hate-watched show
on television.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.320
- I believe it.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:33.403 --> 17:35.988
- Yeah, it's... Oh, it's the worst.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

17:36.072 --> 17:37.712
But in the best way.
You know what I mean?

17:37.782 --> 17:39.117
Thank you. Yeah.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.120
- So, where're you from?
- I'm from South Dakota.

17:42.204 --> 17:44.414
- I'm from Michigan.
- Oh...

17:44.497 --> 17:46.123
Midwesterners...

17:46.207 --> 17:48.293
[both] in the house. Yeah!

17:48.376 --> 17:49.419
Midwest forever.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.920
[both chuckle]

17:51.796 --> 17:53.965
Hey, you know,
I'm gonna go get another drink.

17:54.048 --> 17:56.259
- Mmm-hmm.
- You... you wanna come with me?

17:57.093 --> 17:58.761
Uh, no. It's okay.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.680
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

18:00.763 --> 18:01.931
- You know...
- Oh, no.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.309
- one Midwesterner to another?
- Yeah. No.

18:04.392 --> 18:07.312
Uh, I'm...
I'm seriously working on this one.

18:07.395 --> 18:10.106
So, it'll be a waste of money
for you to get me a drink,

18:10.190 --> 18:12.525
'cause I'm still...
I'm kind of going easy, so...

18:13.568 --> 18:16.070
- Thank you. Thank you, though.
- [indistinct chatter]

18:24.954 --> 18:26.206
[sighs]

18:27.582 --> 18:29.709
[chuckles] Yeah.

18:31.669 --> 18:33.421
[indistinct chatter]

18:40.387 --> 18:41.804
Hey, what's up, man? [chuckles]

18:41.888 --> 18:43.055
- Hey!
- Hey! What's up?

18:43.139 --> 18:44.533
- What's up?
- Why you looking at your phone?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.017
- You phone worm. [laughs]
- Ah!

18:46.100 --> 18:48.228
[chuckles] I know.
I'm attached to this thing.

18:48.311 --> 18:50.063
- Yeah.
- Everything okay? [chuckles]

18:50.146 --> 18:51.940
- Yeah, no, I'm...
- Nice. You having fun?

18:52.023 --> 18:53.733
- I'm having a good time.
- Good. Me, too.

18:53.816 --> 18:55.377
- Yeah, it's great. So much fun.
- So much fun.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.445
- So much fun. Yeah.
- These girls are cool.

18:57.529 --> 19:00.072
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

19:00.782 --> 19:02.951
Come on, what's up? I know you.

19:03.034 --> 19:04.076
- [chuckles]
- Whatever.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.789
I don't mean to be a baby or whatever.
It's just, I don't know,

19:07.872 --> 19:09.725
I thought this was going to be
a boys' night out.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.501
It is. Now we're talking to girls.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.670
Right. Right, right. I just, uh...

19:14.712 --> 19:17.340
I don't know.
Doesn't this feel weird sometimes?

19:17.424 --> 19:19.050
- What?
- This kinda...

19:19.133 --> 19:21.219
This whole thing we're doing,
you know?

19:21.719 --> 19:23.179
Aren't we past this by now?

19:23.263 --> 19:26.099
Like, a group of guys all getting together
and trying to...

19:26.182 --> 19:28.977
- flirt and hit on girls? It's just...
- Uh...

19:29.060 --> 19:31.938
- No, that's awesome. What? [chuckles]
- Yeah.

19:32.021 --> 19:35.358
'Cause I just... I look out
at this room, and I just see

19:35.442 --> 19:39.862
a bunch of, like,
giant penises and giant vaginas

19:39.946 --> 19:42.657
just, like, dancin' around each other...

19:42.740 --> 19:44.742
Yeah, that's beautiful, man.

19:44.826 --> 19:46.578
Whatever.
I'm having a good time.

19:46.661 --> 19:48.580
- Yeah.
- I'm having a good time.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.122
And back to the phone.

19:50.206 --> 19:54.168
"What possession of your partner's
would you throw out if you could?"

19:54.251 --> 19:56.128
- [Syd] Mmm.
- I know what you'd say.

19:56.212 --> 19:57.898
- Your Grateful Dead tank top.
- My Grateful Dead tank top.

19:57.922 --> 19:59.048
It's so disgusting.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.592
Um, why do I have

20:00.675 --> 20:04.637
a life-size Reggie Jackson in my house?
I'm an adult woman.

20:04.721 --> 20:06.782
- [both chuckling]
- [Jeff] I can't keep it in the garage.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.350
It'll get moldy. And it's valuable.

20:08.433 --> 20:12.478
- And maybe it'll pay for Otis' college.
- [chuckles] Yeah, it could pay for, like,

20:12.562 --> 20:14.606
the subway fare
up to the college one time.

20:14.689 --> 20:15.815
All right. All right.

20:15.898 --> 20:18.109
- How about you, Mick?
- I'm not partnered up right now.

20:18.192 --> 20:20.027
So, pass, I guess.

20:20.111 --> 20:22.322
I'm sorry.
I thought you were seeing somebody.

20:22.405 --> 20:24.615
What about that...
The little guy with the goggles?

20:24.699 --> 20:27.118
Gus?
No, we're just friends.

20:27.201 --> 20:30.997
Oh, that's too bad. He's so sweet.
He could be, like, your Jeff.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.999
- Yeah, like the sexual dynamo?
- [scoffs]

20:33.082 --> 20:35.292
- [chuckles]
- [Syd] Don't say that. He's great in bed.

20:35.377 --> 20:36.378
I know.

20:37.294 --> 20:39.213
Oh, you were serious?

20:39.296 --> 20:42.049
- [laughing] Oh, honey, I'm so sorry!
- [Jeff] Jesus.

20:42.133 --> 20:45.470
- Wow. Wow.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

20:45.553 --> 20:46.929
A new question.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.264
Um...

20:49.432 --> 20:50.642
Ooh, okay.

20:50.725 --> 20:53.811
If you could sleep with someone
in your partner's family,

20:53.895 --> 20:55.563
- who would it be?
- [Syd] Oh!

20:55.646 --> 20:57.940
Easy. Jeff's dad when he was 25.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.361
What? [chuckles] Interesting.

21:01.444 --> 21:02.612
All right. Okay, you two. Go.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.072
- [chuckles]
- Your sister.

21:05.156 --> 21:07.009
- You'd fuck my sister?
- Whoa, it's just a game.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.118
[Shaun] You think she's prettier than me?

21:09.201 --> 21:10.953
She's the best looking in your family.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.140
Do you want me to pick
an unattractive member of your family?

21:13.164 --> 21:16.042
You guys are always having your own
private conversations about music.

21:16.125 --> 21:18.127
- It is so fucking pretentious.
- [sighs]

21:18.211 --> 21:22.840
- She interned at Sub Pop.
- That's not a cool thing anymore!

21:22.924 --> 21:24.300
She's a great tambourine player.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.095
What the fuck?
That's nothing to brag about.

21:27.178 --> 21:29.597
Anybody can play
the motherfucking tambourine.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.350
That is not true.
It is a difficult instrument to play.

21:32.433 --> 21:34.537
- You don't understand...
- Why don't we pick another card?

21:34.561 --> 21:35.681
[Syd and Jeff] Another card.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.772
No, no, no.
Liz, Liz, Liz. Go, go, go.

21:37.855 --> 21:39.106
Okay. Um...

21:39.190 --> 21:41.150
I would fuck your cousin Annette.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.695
- Who?
- Remember at your brother's wedding?

21:43.778 --> 21:46.906
She was dancing near us
wearing a green dress.

21:46.989 --> 21:49.826
I think she works for Alaska Airlines.
Her nipple popped out.

21:49.909 --> 21:50.993
That's not my cousin.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.662
That's my family friend's daughter.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.581
And she's half your age.

21:54.664 --> 21:57.875
Okay, that's who I choose to fuck.
Thank you for saying that I'm old.

21:57.959 --> 22:00.920
I'm not saying you're old.
I was saying that she was young.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.675
Was that card even real?
Are you just stirring shit?

22:05.758 --> 22:07.635
No, what're you talking about?

22:07.719 --> 22:09.721
- I'm checking the cards.
- No. My God!

22:09.804 --> 22:11.806
- Go ahead, check. It's real.
- Brian, drop it.

22:11.889 --> 22:14.892
- I think I know what's going on.
- Why? It's a game.

22:14.976 --> 22:17.162
- What difference does it make?
- Trust me, it's not here.

22:17.186 --> 22:20.106
Oh, my gosh.
You always think that I'm the enemy.

22:20.189 --> 22:22.066
Well, I'm looking,
and I don't see anything.

22:22.150 --> 22:23.901
This is classic bullshit. I'm sick of it.

22:23.985 --> 22:25.862
- [Syd] It's a game.
- [Liz] No, it's not.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.947
I came to have fun.
I don't wanna be fucked with.

22:28.030 --> 22:29.091
She put it in the middle. I saw.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.115
- Jesus Christ. The card isn't here.
- [Mickey] No!

22:31.159 --> 22:33.202
You made it up. Classic Mickey shit.

22:33.286 --> 22:35.663
You hate us because we
have families with children.

22:35.747 --> 22:37.475
I don't hate you
'cause you have a family with kids.

22:37.499 --> 22:39.876
You're just a little bit boring!

22:39.959 --> 22:42.336
Oh, I'm sorry we can't be
as cool as Mickey Dobbs.

22:42.419 --> 22:44.255
You guys, stop it. Please.

22:44.338 --> 22:46.048
So you were fucking with us?

22:46.132 --> 22:50.261
- I mean, that's what's happening here?
- Yes, I was. I made it up.

22:50.344 --> 22:53.097
I'm sorry I tried
to liven this party up a little bit

22:53.180 --> 22:55.850
and get away from talking
about the Waldorf School

22:55.933 --> 22:58.102
and princess dresses
and pinworms.

22:58.185 --> 23:01.147
I just... can't stand it!

23:05.026 --> 23:08.487
Sorry, I've ruined everything again.
I'll just go.

23:09.363 --> 23:10.615
What the fuck?

23:11.783 --> 23:12.867
Wow.

23:15.537 --> 23:16.996
- Damn.
- [Jeff clears throat]

23:17.079 --> 23:18.289
Okay, I'll go now.

23:19.206 --> 23:21.543
"What body part
are you most attracted to?"

23:21.626 --> 23:22.794
[Liz] On myself?

23:22.877 --> 23:24.879
- Your dad's dick.
- What the... [laughing]

23:24.962 --> 23:27.089
- I'm just trying to have fun.
- [all laughing]

23:28.633 --> 23:31.594
Who here has had a pedicure
and will admit it?

23:31.678 --> 23:33.512
- I've had one before.
- Um...

23:33.596 --> 23:35.723
- I have never had a pedicure.
- [Lauren] Yesterday.

23:35.807 --> 23:37.559
[indistinct chatter]

23:41.312 --> 23:42.647
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:42.730 --> 23:43.940
Hello.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.942
So, um, what's your problem?

23:46.025 --> 23:49.195
- My problem?
- Yeah. You, like, totally blew me off.

23:49.278 --> 23:50.738
I'm sorry. I just...

23:51.656 --> 23:55.952
just got a little uncomfortable
when you were flirting with me...

23:56.035 --> 23:57.036
What...

23:57.119 --> 23:59.038
I just wanna let you know
that I'm, like,

23:59.121 --> 24:00.915
not interested in hooking up tonight.

24:00.998 --> 24:03.084
You thought
that I was flirting with you?

24:04.126 --> 24:06.295
Well, weren't you?
Obviously you were...

24:06.378 --> 24:09.256
Go fuck yourself, okay?
I have a boyfriend.

24:10.424 --> 24:11.801
Oh. Oh?

24:12.719 --> 24:15.054
- Okay, I didn't know that. Obviously.
- Yeah.

24:15.137 --> 24:18.140
I've spent exactly zero seconds
thinking about hooking up with you.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.352
Wait, so, like, why were you
even talking to me this whole time?

24:21.435 --> 24:25.481
Because I'm friendly.
And I find human nature interesting.

24:25.565 --> 24:29.151
- Uh-huh. Okay.
- [mocking Gus] Uh-huh. Okay.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.071
[normal] I'm not gonna stay home
because my boyfriend's out of town.

24:32.154 --> 24:37.702
All right. Well, I obviously misjudged
this whole situation tonight,

24:37.785 --> 24:39.787
so, I'm just...
I'm the wrong one.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.414
- So I'm gonna get outta here.
- Oh.

24:41.497 --> 24:43.207
- Yeah? You're walking away?
- Yeah.

24:43.290 --> 24:44.709
Oh, walk away, big guy.

24:44.792 --> 24:46.252
- Tough guy.
- Okay, look.

24:46.335 --> 24:48.796
I am obviously sorry for the...

24:50.339 --> 24:53.134
Holy shit.
That's Michael Landon.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.638
I know that's not significant for you,

24:56.721 --> 25:00.391
but for me, that's so fucking crazy
that I'm seeing Michael Landon right now.

25:00.474 --> 25:01.517
You're an asshole.

25:02.476 --> 25:03.894
Don't leave. Where're you going?

25:04.812 --> 25:07.606
Hey, let me buy you a drink.
Whatever you want, I got it.

25:11.235 --> 25:13.070
- Hey, man, you okay?
- Yeah.

25:13.154 --> 25:15.823
I was just taking a picture
of Michael Landon.

25:16.741 --> 25:18.242
- Who?
- Michael Landon.

25:18.326 --> 25:22.121
I don't think I'm in the right headspace
for this, so I'm gonna get outta here.

25:22.204 --> 25:23.831
Come on. I wanted to have fun tonight.

25:23.915 --> 25:26.625
I know and I love that about you, Chris.
Seriously.

25:26.709 --> 25:27.877
You're the best, man.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.837
- But I'm gonna get outta here.
- All right.

25:29.921 --> 25:31.064
- I'll see you around?
- Okay.

25:31.088 --> 25:32.715
Okay. I'll see you guys around.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.217
- Nice to meet you. Bye!
- [Chris] Later.

25:37.011 --> 25:38.345
Whatever.
