WEBVTT

00:08.718 --> 00:13.473
<i>Come in ceremony</i>

00:15.475 --> 00:20.689
<i>Come to be under blood</i>

00:21.940 --> 00:26.903
<i>Bring all your tired lions</i>

00:44.671 --> 00:45.839
Another full house, huh?

00:46.005 --> 00:48.383
Yes, and tomorrow night, too. It's Lent.

00:55.432 --> 00:56.766
I was thinking I might take it off.

00:59.769 --> 01:00.770
Go somewhere.

01:03.022 --> 01:06.818
There's no law against movie-seeing.
Bring me that whiskey.

01:15.577 --> 01:16.578
Actually,

01:19.080 --> 01:24.085
I was thinking I might go somewhere far.

01:24.961 --> 01:25.962
Meaning what?

01:26.671 --> 01:29.799
There's this girl back in Texas,
from when I was a kid.

01:31.468 --> 01:32.594
Just go check on her.

01:34.596 --> 01:36.014
Anyway, that's what I'm thinking.

01:37.599 --> 01:38.683
It's what I'm doing.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.395
I'd come back, of course.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.064
Someday.

01:46.441 --> 01:49.068
Listen to me,
you "someday" piece of shit.

01:50.612 --> 01:52.864
We're all that's left in this place.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.367
I am all the family you got.

01:56.993 --> 01:58.495
Yeah, 'cause you killed all the rest.

01:58.578 --> 01:59.579
What's that?

02:01.414 --> 02:02.582
Speak up, boy.

02:02.874 --> 02:04.459
You killed my family.

02:09.631 --> 02:10.632
That's right.

02:13.343 --> 02:15.470
I had your daddy shot.

02:18.056 --> 02:20.558
Your mama, I killed myself.

02:22.477 --> 02:28.233
I sliced her open with a small blade
and I sucked up her soul.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.530
But instead of wreaking vengeance,

02:33.613 --> 02:37.992
you just stand there like a little girl,
bringing whiskey.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.119
Oh, jeez.

02:41.704 --> 02:44.249
You still think like a Custer.

02:44.332 --> 02:48.753
That if you do just enough right
and not too much wrong,

02:49.045 --> 02:51.548
that there's still hope for you.

02:53.925 --> 02:56.219
It's because you're afraid of Hell.

02:58.346 --> 03:02.934
Oh, and you know what?
I don't blame you.

03:44.601 --> 03:45.768
Killing your Gran'ma.

03:46.728 --> 03:48.730
Damning yourself to the flames.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.484
What would your father say?

04:03.453 --> 04:04.454
I'm going.

04:09.918 --> 04:10.919
You'll be back.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.597
You should've killed her.

04:23.473 --> 04:25.767
Yeah, well, now's your chance.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.970
Sorry, Lil' Jesse.

05:45.555 --> 05:47.849
You're gonna have to raise them hands.

05:49.058 --> 05:52.937
Now, I know that she put you
through your paces,

05:53.980 --> 05:56.858
but, come on, she's your grandma.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.568
Give me the gun, T.C.

05:58.735 --> 06:03.656
And I believe there has to be
a constructive, non-violent solution.

06:03.865 --> 06:04.866
Give me the gun.

06:09.996 --> 06:11.164
Christ.

06:11.497 --> 06:12.498
Back up.

06:17.587 --> 06:20.590
How many times you think
you pointed this thing at me, T.C.?

06:23.176 --> 06:26.137
Lil' Jesse, you don't hate me that much.

06:27.847 --> 06:29.223
You wouldn't shoot me?

06:31.726 --> 06:32.727
No.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.230
I guess I wouldn't.

06:38.816 --> 06:41.903
See? I knew it. I knew it.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.821
A constructive, non-violent...

06:43.905 --> 06:44.906
Shoot yourself.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.589
Hey, kid.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.968
You gotta go through me first.

07:11.224 --> 07:12.600
I like that idea.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.437
Put it down.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.404
I could make you
cut your own throat if I wanted to.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.241
But you ain't gonna.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.162
No.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.041
Let's go to the Tombs.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.919
Hope for you yet, boy.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.923
My name
is SS Reichsmarschall Rick Smith.

09:07.924 --> 09:08.925
Here's my demand.

09:09.342 --> 09:10.801
Send out Hilter and no one gets hurt.

09:12.220 --> 09:15.473
Resist, and you will be liquidated.

09:15.890 --> 09:18.851
If you're the SS,
why are you wearing a Luftwaffe medal?

09:21.270 --> 09:22.605
We're a mixed auxiliary unit.

09:23.231 --> 09:25.358
The point is,
I have a freaking tank and you don't.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.652
So, release our <i>Führer,</i>

09:28.236 --> 09:31.113
or I will have no choice
but to tell my men to cut you down.

09:32.031 --> 09:33.407
Those are my terms.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.702
What is your answer?

09:54.387 --> 09:57.265
Get it off me! Let me go, damn it!

09:57.682 --> 09:59.100
You're not going anywhere!

10:04.313 --> 10:06.274
<i>No stopping
at the red light girl</i>

10:06.357 --> 10:08.067
<i>Because I want to get your signal</i>

10:08.150 --> 10:12.071
<i>No going at the green light girl
Because I want to be with you now</i>

10:12.154 --> 10:15.950
<i>You are my special
You are my special</i>

10:20.246 --> 10:21.247
Yo, Nazi.

10:22.456 --> 10:23.457
Let's go.

11:25.603 --> 11:26.854
You said you'd changed...

11:27.146 --> 11:29.565
I have my soul patch.

12:12.108 --> 12:13.234
Luger.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.198
All those crows.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.660
Do you think they pecked
your daughter's eyes out

12:22.743 --> 12:23.911
after she was dead?

12:25.413 --> 12:28.165
Or while she was lying there,
still alive?

12:31.544 --> 12:32.545
Yeah.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.297
I think so, too.

12:52.148 --> 12:53.858
No! No, Eugene!

12:54.942 --> 12:56.193
What would Jesus do?

13:25.931 --> 13:26.932
Sorry.

13:27.391 --> 13:28.392
These boots suck!

13:35.274 --> 13:36.775
She's really not that bad!

13:37.526 --> 13:39.153
Could you just let us go...

13:39.445 --> 13:41.030
...just forget about it?

13:55.377 --> 13:57.755
So difficult and pretty.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.883
So fun.
You're gonna be a hit down in Hell.

14:07.765 --> 14:10.100
I know you're trying to be
all scary and stuff,

14:11.685 --> 14:14.855
but your breath... Seriously.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.112
Not good.

14:22.238 --> 14:23.239
Look out!

14:47.638 --> 14:51.850
You see? I am a loving God.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.035
Ah...

15:12.037 --> 15:14.832
Betrayal, when committed by a loved one,

15:15.833 --> 15:17.126
cuts most deeply.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.140
Perhaps there's still hope for him.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.826
Change your mind.

15:53.871 --> 15:54.872
Join me.

15:56.749 --> 15:58.959
- Bugger off.
- I'll let you die.

16:00.586 --> 16:04.089
I won't want to, but I will.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.966
Yeah, well, go ahead.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.470
I've had a good run.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.263
You've barely had 100 years.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.183
You've never had a Château Lafite.

16:14.266 --> 16:17.186
You've never seen a tiger in the wild.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.064
Cassidy, you've never been to Asia.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.524
Well, maybe there's an Asia
when you die, you know?

16:22.816 --> 16:23.859
Maybe there's not.

16:24.485 --> 16:28.739
Maybe there's no sex, no food, no music.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.240
Maybe there's nothing.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.077
You'd choose that
over what I can offer you?

16:33.160 --> 16:36.622
Over lying, cannibalism and murder?

16:37.164 --> 16:38.916
- Yeah, sure.
- No.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.089
Over love, pleasure, life.

16:45.756 --> 16:46.757
This.

16:51.387 --> 16:53.222
- What is that?
- It's a pipe.

16:53.806 --> 16:55.057
I ordered it specially.

16:55.349 --> 16:58.894
See, you sprinkle your drugs
in this end, and on this end...

16:59.103 --> 17:01.397
I know how a bloody pipe works,
you moron.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.693
- What's it off?
- A unicorn.

17:06.402 --> 17:07.486
Your favorite.

17:09.946 --> 17:10.989
It's this...

17:14.367 --> 17:15.577
Or burn.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.255
Nice trick.

17:26.922 --> 17:30.843
Freeing one of my children from Hell
is my favorite trick of all.

17:32.511 --> 17:35.889
Bunch of Nazis and a tank.
I was figuring it out.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.725
No, you were going to Hell.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.145
But I am a merciful God.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.398
What about Eugene, huh?

17:45.149 --> 17:46.608
You gonna be merciful with him, too?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.986
- Which one's he?
- With the face.

17:49.153 --> 17:50.529
Oh, oh, right.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.072
Uh, no.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.408
His path is different.

17:56.660 --> 18:00.080
I've come for you, to lift your curse.

18:01.290 --> 18:05.753
From this day forward,
the name O'Hare will be blessed.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.881
Yeah?

18:11.175 --> 18:12.176
What do you get?

18:13.177 --> 18:15.637
The joy that only giving brings.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.223
And?

18:20.184 --> 18:22.728
Tell Jesse Custer
to stop looking for me.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.147
To stay away.

18:25.647 --> 18:29.151
Genesis cannot, must not,

18:29.610 --> 18:32.529
interfere with my great design.
Go to him.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.032
Stop him,

18:35.407 --> 18:39.745
and then you will know true peace
and be forgiven.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.541
You know,

18:46.084 --> 18:47.544
I don't need forgiveness.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.838
Right.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.549
Tulip O'Hare, pure as the driven snow.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.302
Yeah,

18:56.970 --> 19:01.141
I done some bad things.
Things I ain't proud of.

19:01.225 --> 19:03.560
For Christ's sake,
you killed a man with a corncob.

19:03.769 --> 19:06.647
I'm not perfect, I know that.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.109
But I don't need your forgiveness.

19:13.821 --> 19:17.658
I mean, I made it this far without it,
didn't I?

19:18.867 --> 19:19.868
Oh.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.578
So be it.

19:22.538 --> 19:24.623
- Free will...
- Damn right.

19:24.748 --> 19:30.295
...has its consequences. For you
and for those you claim to care about.

19:30.963 --> 19:33.674
- What's that mean?
- Your friend Cassidy.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.426
- Yeah, what about him?
- He's in grave danger.

19:37.052 --> 19:40.055
I was going to help,
show you I'm a loving God,

19:40.472 --> 19:42.224
but sounds like
you don't need me at all.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.060
I call bullshit.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.854
Go see for yourself.

19:47.437 --> 19:52.067
But you better hurry.
The danger is quite grave.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.151
Mmm-mmm.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.906
This is one of your tricks,
a distraction to keep us off your ass.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.284
Well, forget I mentioned it.

20:01.743 --> 20:07.249
Let's just stand here by the water
and enjoy the silence.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.888
You're a dick.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.559
You're welcome.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.105
Yeah, I see you. Give me a sec.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.247
Out!

21:11.021 --> 21:13.899
Wait. I shouldn't have said that
about crows,

21:15.609 --> 21:17.069
about your girl's eyes.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.198
I'm sorry, okay?

21:23.659 --> 21:24.660
I'm sorry. I didn't really...

21:31.541 --> 21:32.751
My eyes!

21:37.297 --> 21:38.340
Time to go.

21:43.387 --> 21:44.721
What about Tulip?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.270
Her lucky day.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.541
Welcome, you motherless goat-humpers.

22:12.624 --> 22:16.461
I always wanted to say that.
Okay, now...

23:09.097 --> 23:10.307
That was different.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.150
Well,
I'm not playing pool again.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.194
Can I get you anything?

23:23.070 --> 23:24.071
Yeah.

23:24.738 --> 23:25.989
There's a drink in my coat.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.255
I saw a unicorn once, you know.

23:42.631 --> 23:44.633
I remember. You told me.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.263
Thank you.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.023
- Better?
- Than being crucified?

24:01.358 --> 24:02.901
A touch. Coolant?

24:03.610 --> 24:05.028
Actually, no, scrap that.

24:05.529 --> 24:07.572
You're the one who threw up
three wine coolers the other night.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.866
Give it to me. Thank you.

24:12.994 --> 24:13.995
Jesus.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.499
It's gonna be days
before I can masturbate properly.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.708
Mmm.

24:20.669 --> 24:22.420
Well, we can't have that.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.840
I've got some squirrel blood
in the freezer.

24:25.799 --> 24:26.842
It's quite restorative.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.678
It's better than cat or dog.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.763
I just cheated death,

24:33.014 --> 24:35.600
and I got back
with my handsome lunatic friend.

24:37.227 --> 24:40.313
I don't want any of your
goddamn squirrel blood, all right?

24:43.483 --> 24:46.069
He's repented.
He wants to be with us again.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.991
Blood ceremony to celebrate.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.743
Who will take flight?

25:03.879 --> 25:04.880
Perfect.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.084
I was looking for this.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.589
Took it from your daddy, years ago.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.007
You stop that.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.134
We Custers don't cry,

25:52.969 --> 25:53.970
we fight.

25:57.974 --> 25:59.309
Remember that night, boy?

26:00.810 --> 26:01.811
I remember.

27:02.372 --> 27:04.207
Today was the day.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.292
Oh.

27:07.002 --> 27:08.920
Go get two cans of gasoline.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.006
- Two cans?
- Go get them.

27:36.448 --> 27:37.699
Proud of you, boy.

27:48.209 --> 27:49.753
Comfy, actually.

27:50.086 --> 27:55.091
Although, after, I may need
a lint roller on my backside.

27:59.429 --> 28:00.430
Dinnertime.

28:01.806 --> 28:04.601
- Christ. How's that coolant feeling?
- Fine. Fine.

28:05.643 --> 28:08.313
- All right, well, go on. After you.
- No, no, after you.

28:08.772 --> 28:09.773
Hey, listen.

28:11.274 --> 28:12.275
Have you ever...

28:13.276 --> 28:14.861
Hmm.

28:14.944 --> 28:19.866
Mrs. Rosen, would you have any
objection at all to a ménage à trois?

28:21.743 --> 28:25.538
On the contrary, I'd be honored.

28:32.879 --> 28:36.049
Tie your life to ours
and allow us to do the same.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.927
- Yes.
- Are you ready to pass through?

28:39.677 --> 28:41.596
- Yes.
- Yeah, she's ready.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.642
What's that? What is...

28:47.143 --> 28:48.144
Bite marks.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.442
What's going on?

28:57.946 --> 28:59.322
Answer me.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.584
What have you done?

29:32.647 --> 29:35.775
How many calls to his flown children
did you make, Mrs. Rosen?

29:35.859 --> 29:37.110
Eighty-seven.

29:38.403 --> 29:39.612
And how many answered?

29:40.780 --> 29:41.781
None.

29:43.074 --> 29:44.784
So you turned her.

29:50.457 --> 29:51.708
<i>She turned the rest.</i>

30:01.301 --> 30:02.302
Now what?

30:03.303 --> 30:08.391
Go back to your loveless
and lonely existence?

30:11.060 --> 30:12.187
Well, yeah, probably.

30:13.605 --> 30:16.441
But first, dinnertime.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.965
All right, let's go.

30:43.426 --> 30:44.719
Ain't you gonna kill me?

30:45.720 --> 30:47.055
I don't hate you that much.

30:49.474 --> 30:50.475
Come on.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.483
Nah, I'm good.

31:01.903 --> 31:07.450
Angelville, I knows it's wicked
and evil and all that, but...

31:09.911 --> 31:11.579
I got nowhere else to go.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.376
Are you sure?

31:25.426 --> 31:27.136
Good seeing you again, Lil' Jesse.

31:30.390 --> 31:35.770
<i>I give my life for thee</i>

31:35.853 --> 31:42.026
<i>My precious blood I shed</i>

31:42.277 --> 31:47.574
<i>That thou might ransomed be</i>

31:47.699 --> 31:53.162
<i>And raised up from the dead</i>

31:53.288 --> 32:00.169
<i>I gave my life for thee</i>

32:01.045 --> 32:07.510
<i>What hast thou giv'n for me?</i>

32:08.928 --> 32:14.559
<i>And I have brought to thee</i>

32:14.642 --> 32:19.689
<i>Down from my home above</i>

32:19.856 --> 32:24.986
<i>Salvation full and free</i>

32:25.111 --> 32:30.450
<i>My pardon and my love</i>

32:30.575 --> 32:37.415
<i>Rich gifts I brought to thee</i>

32:38.249 --> 32:45.089
<i>What hast thou brought for me?</i>

32:55.099 --> 32:56.267
Welcome home.

32:59.604 --> 33:00.647
Is that for me?

33:05.193 --> 33:08.738
What's in there, you could live
for another 100 years at least.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.327
- My debt is paid.
- Not so sure about that...

33:14.661 --> 33:16.621
- Say "Your debt is paid."
- Your debt is paid.

33:18.456 --> 33:19.582
Release Tulip.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.760
- Jesus.
- Jesus has nothing to do with this.

33:33.429 --> 33:36.265
Fine. You won.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.059
Go on,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.688
leave your poor Gran'ma all by herself.

33:41.771 --> 33:43.356
I've tried that once before.

33:44.524 --> 33:48.319
Walking away, leaving you behind.

33:49.570 --> 33:50.697
It didn't work.

33:54.992 --> 33:58.913
Wherever I went, Angelville was with me,

33:59.497 --> 34:02.583
in the back of my head,
like some kind of bad dream.

34:05.795 --> 34:07.380
But today's the day I wake up.

34:09.172 --> 34:13.261
Today's the day I'm gonna kill you
and burn this house to the ground.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.389
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

34:19.308 --> 34:22.018
Been thinking 20 years
on how I'm gonna do it.

34:23.646 --> 34:28.609
Well, I figured, no better way than
to strap you into your own machine

34:29.569 --> 34:30.902
and turn you to dust.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.324
Well, if it's my time for Heaven...

34:35.699 --> 34:36.701
Heaven?

34:38.911 --> 34:43.708
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but you're going straight to Hell.

34:44.751 --> 34:46.878
I hate to break it to you, but...

34:49.630 --> 34:51.924
I made a deal with my gentleman caller.

34:54.886 --> 34:56.596
You know, Satan.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.976
<i>And we came to a new agreement.</i>

35:04.312 --> 35:05.521
<i>If you kill me,</i>

35:07.565 --> 35:11.152
when you die,
you're the one going to Hell.

35:15.323 --> 35:16.657
What did you do?

35:28.586 --> 35:29.587
Oh, God.

35:30.588 --> 35:34.300
I'm not walking out of here
with you still breathing.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.177
Don't be so upset, Jesse.

35:37.470 --> 35:38.763
I saved your girl.

35:39.722 --> 35:41.140
You got your power.

35:42.391 --> 35:43.601
You're free of me.

35:44.644 --> 35:47.522
Sweetheart, you won.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.906
But you won, too, didn't you, Gran'ma?

36:02.328 --> 36:03.830
One hundred years' worth.

36:06.833 --> 36:07.875
No.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.086
One hundred more years
than my daddy got.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.047
No, I mean it.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.132
One hundred more years than my mama had.

36:15.675 --> 36:19.136
One hundred more years
of you being a rotten piece of shit!

36:19.220 --> 36:21.180
These are mine. That's the deal.

36:21.514 --> 36:23.558
Like you said, Gran'ma. "New deal."

36:26.394 --> 36:27.478
Destroy them.

36:35.528 --> 36:36.529
No.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.325
No.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.703
<i>Jesse!</i>

37:07.894 --> 37:12.023
<i>I should be glad we parted</i>

37:12.523 --> 37:14.400
<i>I guess</i>

37:16.110 --> 37:20.448
<i>I should be glad that it's over</i>

37:20.740 --> 37:22.992
<i>And you...</i>

37:23.075 --> 37:27.538
She's right.
I got what I came for. I won.

37:30.166 --> 37:31.417
Doesn't feel like it.

37:34.128 --> 37:37.632
No, it doesn't.

37:42.345 --> 37:44.639
You'll burn in Hell for this.

37:45.181 --> 37:47.683
Maybe, someday,

37:48.059 --> 37:51.520
but today, you burn.

37:55.358 --> 37:57.276
Jesse. Jesse.

37:58.110 --> 38:01.447
Jesse! No, no, no!

38:05.576 --> 38:08.162
Jesse! No, Jesse!

38:12.833 --> 38:13.834
Jesse!

38:52.707 --> 38:53.833
Now what?

38:54.500 --> 38:58.212
Get a Dustbuster. Maybe a sponge.

38:58.629 --> 39:03.634
But after that,
now that we're night wraiths?

39:04.010 --> 39:06.971
Well, you can stop calling yourselves
"night wraiths," that's for one.

39:07.054 --> 39:10.141
Christ. You're just bloody vampires now,
all right?

39:10.224 --> 39:13.394
Right. But what do we do?

39:15.855 --> 39:17.398
Whatever we bloody want.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.198
Tulip?

39:27.450 --> 39:29.410
All right. All right, slow down now.

39:29.994 --> 39:30.995
What's that?

39:31.287 --> 39:34.040
I've been trying
to call you, Cass. Are you okay?

39:35.041 --> 39:38.461
Like, you're not in any danger, are you?

39:40.004 --> 39:41.005
Where are you?

39:43.007 --> 39:45.593
Got it. And you sure you're okay?

39:45.885 --> 39:48.179
Well, I've been to the far side
of the moon and back, actually.

39:48.262 --> 39:51.724
But I think the danger portion's
over now, so...

39:51.974 --> 39:54.268
All right, well, I'm on my way.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.228
- Tulip?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

39:57.980 --> 39:58.981
I, um...

39:59.857 --> 40:01.150
Yeah, Cass?

40:02.193 --> 40:04.403
- Hey, look who it is.
- Hey, Hoover's back.

40:04.487 --> 40:05.488
Hoover!

40:08.657 --> 40:09.742
Hoover.

40:10.201 --> 40:11.410
What do you mean, "Hoover"?

40:12.036 --> 40:13.412
It's all right.
It's all right.

40:13.496 --> 40:15.456
It's just Hoover.
He's cool now, all right?

40:15.539 --> 40:18.709
Don't worry about it.
Listen, I'll see you soon.

40:20.544 --> 40:22.338
Thanks for calling me up, all right?

40:23.547 --> 40:24.840
All right, see you in a bit.

40:26.926 --> 40:27.927
So...

40:29.887 --> 40:30.888
Where's the party?

40:39.688 --> 40:43.025
So, I'm back at the Grail office,
I get your text, and I say to myself,

40:43.734 --> 40:45.319
- "Why am I here?"
- Hmm.

40:45.945 --> 40:48.572
The hours suck, my boss is crazy,

40:48.656 --> 40:50.282
and the benefits
aren't even that good, you know?

40:50.366 --> 40:51.700
'Course not. They're corporate bastards.

40:51.784 --> 40:53.077
What are you even doing back there?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.411
I thought we agreed
no more being a dick.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.496
You're right.

40:56.664 --> 40:57.665
Old habits.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.836
So, you guys have all turned as well?

41:02.128 --> 41:03.838
- They're already bored.
- Heh.

41:04.088 --> 41:05.965
All right, go on.
Back to work, you buggers.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.550
I was just about to get really high

41:07.633 --> 41:09.301
and blast some Nickelback,
if you're up for that.

41:09.552 --> 41:10.553
Come on.

41:12.096 --> 41:14.223
You know, you saved my life back there.

41:15.558 --> 41:16.559
Got you a present.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.561
- Oh.
- Wanted to return the favor.

41:18.811 --> 41:22.189
An umbrella.
Very droll, secret agent man.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.400
Thank you very much.

41:24.942 --> 41:25.985
Open it.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.696
Indoors? I'm pretty sure
that's bad luck, mate.

41:30.948 --> 41:32.158
What the hell is that?

41:34.368 --> 41:35.703
It's good luck today.

42:40.100 --> 42:41.393
What the hell did you do?

42:41.644 --> 42:44.188
I lied. The benefits are great.

42:50.569 --> 42:53.197
You know I eat horse tranquilizers
for breakfast, don't you?

42:53.489 --> 42:55.699
I told them. That's whale.

43:32.528 --> 43:33.529
Cass?

43:45.374 --> 43:46.875
Some men took him.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.003
- And a woman.
- Dressed in white.

43:57.094 --> 43:58.137
God.

44:02.224 --> 44:03.809
It wasn't until this moment

44:03.892 --> 44:05.477
that I understood what my purpose was.

44:06.812 --> 44:08.063
But now I know.

44:09.356 --> 44:10.482
It's to say:

44:12.276 --> 44:13.819
You're a bad person.

44:15.112 --> 44:17.489
But it's never too late to change that.

44:18.324 --> 44:19.575
Open up your heart and talk to God.

44:20.492 --> 44:22.703
You guys used to be like...
best friends, right? So...

44:23.537 --> 44:25.664
...call him and apologize.

44:29.543 --> 44:30.919
I just realized,

44:32.046 --> 44:33.797
I have a purpose, too.

44:38.719 --> 44:40.971
Get your ass outta your head, doofus.

44:41.388 --> 44:42.389
God's gone.

44:44.516 --> 44:46.018
You didn't have to do that.

44:46.685 --> 44:48.979
Him? We were just joking.

44:49.188 --> 44:53.567
Anyway, you did your part bringing
these two chuckle-heads back.

44:53.942 --> 44:56.153
And now for my part of the bargain.

45:04.661 --> 45:08.082
We'll take it from here, Sidney.
Thank you.

45:13.253 --> 45:16.507
Not sure what happened there,
but I assume she had it coming.

45:19.802 --> 45:24.098
What would this unfortunate
preacher's name happen to be?

45:24.807 --> 45:26.141
Jesse Custer.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.438
I love the synergy.

45:31.647 --> 45:33.565
I just got a deal going
involving Custer.

45:33.732 --> 45:35.317
Figures right into my expansion plans.

45:35.651 --> 45:40.531
See, you kill him, and he
and his little power come to Hell.

45:41.198 --> 45:43.325
Anyway,
won't keep you any longer.

45:43.659 --> 45:46.203
Go without God, as the saying now goes.

45:55.462 --> 46:00.300
How dare you pull a gun
on the Prince of Darkness.

46:00.717 --> 46:04.430
I will flay you into 1,000 pieces.

46:04.638 --> 46:05.806
My daughter.

46:07.349 --> 46:09.059
The crows. Was that your idea?

46:11.895 --> 46:15.983
Okay, okay. Hold on.
Everybody take a breath.

46:17.568 --> 46:18.569
Was it?

46:18.652 --> 46:21.488
I was in on the meeting
when it was discussed.

46:21.989 --> 46:24.533
Sure. All right? But it wasn't my idea.

46:24.908 --> 46:25.909
Whose was it?

46:26.660 --> 46:27.953
Don't be stupid.

46:29.621 --> 46:30.622
It was God's,

46:33.917 --> 46:34.918
of course.

46:38.672 --> 46:39.715
Oh.

46:40.591 --> 46:41.592
Now,

46:42.551 --> 46:47.931
I suggest
you put that gun down right now,

46:48.640 --> 46:52.019
or you and I are gonna have a problem.

46:55.856 --> 46:56.857
Too late.

46:58.192 --> 46:59.359
You crazy son of a...

47:14.666 --> 47:15.667
You can't do that!

47:15.751 --> 47:17.044
The rules have changed.

47:20.839 --> 47:24.009
You were right. You don't belong here.

47:25.427 --> 47:26.428
Let's go.

47:27.846 --> 47:29.181
Good idea. Let's get out of here.

47:30.224 --> 47:32.559
Just him. Not you.

47:53.038 --> 47:54.164
Plum cake, sir?

47:57.167 --> 47:58.168
Yeah.

48:00.420 --> 48:02.798
Extra flaky crust.

48:24.236 --> 48:25.237
Jesse?

48:26.196 --> 48:27.406
He's still alive?

48:28.323 --> 48:30.158
The preacher that sent me here?

48:33.120 --> 48:34.997
The preacher that left me here?

48:37.374 --> 48:38.959
I'm going with you.

49:16.580 --> 49:17.664
Hey.

49:18.665 --> 49:19.666
Hey.

49:21.627 --> 49:22.753
You okay?

49:25.797 --> 49:27.215
Family's overrated.

49:30.969 --> 49:31.970
Yeah.

49:38.018 --> 49:39.019
Ready?

49:41.605 --> 49:42.606
Ready.

49:50.697 --> 49:52.324
<i>Down on the ground</i>

49:53.659 --> 49:56.828
<i>I listen to the long droning sound</i>

49:57.579 --> 50:01.208
<i>Of sinners a-plenty
Our pain, it runs deep</i>

50:02.626 --> 50:04.378
<i>Deeper than oceans</i>

50:06.088 --> 50:10.342
<i>Deeper than sleep</i>

50:17.057 --> 50:18.392
Holy shit.

50:23.897 --> 50:25.399
Cassidy's resting peacefully.

50:26.650 --> 50:27.818
Not for long.

50:28.318 --> 50:32.155
My favorite torturer
is flying in from Bensonhurst.

50:32.239 --> 50:33.240
Frankie Toscani?

50:34.741 --> 50:35.784
Wow.

50:37.786 --> 50:39.162
The hat, Hoover.

50:40.789 --> 50:42.082
Are you mocking me?

50:43.333 --> 50:48.130
No, I'm a vampire now, sir. Remember?

50:57.806 --> 50:59.391
I thought you were joking.

51:00.183 --> 51:02.769
Uh, no. It's true.

51:04.354 --> 51:09.359
But let me assure you, it will have
no impact whatsoever on my job...

51:17.159 --> 51:18.201
Idiot.

51:23.206 --> 51:24.416
What happened here, sir?

51:24.750 --> 51:25.751
Hmm?

51:26.251 --> 51:27.252
Oh.

51:28.253 --> 51:31.339
We're going to need a new Hoover.

51:33.383 --> 51:34.593
I'll look into it, sir.

51:36.970 --> 51:38.680
Gonna be tricky, don't you think?

51:40.182 --> 51:43.518
Getting Custer to be our Messiah.
Now, after everything.

51:44.895 --> 51:46.938
I don't want him to be my Messiah.

51:50.734 --> 51:53.236
So, why are we waiting for him?

51:53.737 --> 51:56.114
Custer has humiliated me
for the last time.

51:56.698 --> 52:00.494
I'm going to torture him in the most
horrible ways ever imagined.

52:02.496 --> 52:05.749
And then, I'm going to kill him.

52:07.417 --> 52:11.963
Love it. The great chess match
for world domination continues.

52:14.633 --> 52:17.135
I'm tired of chess matches, Flufferman.

52:18.470 --> 52:22.557
It's time to play some fucking checkers.
