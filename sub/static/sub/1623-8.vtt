00:03.629 --> 00:04.664
What is there to tell?

00:04.838 --> 00:07.830
About your best friend?
Who devours blondes for dinner.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.081
Elena wasn't blonde.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.958
Elena was a whole different thing.

The core is unstable!

00:13.388 --> 00:16.596
- This Operation Troy?
- They said the virus starts in 2015.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.717
The virus is mutating.
Soon not even the immune will survive.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.935
There's nothing
you wouldn't do for this.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.059
No.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.776
You open that case,
everything goes to hell.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.651
- What are you doing?
- Trying to stop a plague.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.241
You need to tell them
they have to destroy this place.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.446

00:37.579 --> 00:40.036
If I die here with the virus
the future will be saved.

Please tell me you're not praying right
now. Lady, you don't seem the type.

01:12.656 --> 01:16.023
Secondly, it scares me the fact that you
might need some "divine" intervention

01:16.159 --> 01:18.070
bringing our boy back home.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.410
I'll take whatever I can get.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.410
Where is he?

01:24.543 --> 01:28.786
Our last reading puts Mr Cole's
tracer signal in Chechnya 2015.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.911
Operation Troy.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.715
I'm not gonna say it.

01:33.844 --> 01:37.632
Then I will say it.
Clearly, we did not stop the plague.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.597
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys
remains one step ahead.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.635
So, time to bring Mr Cole home
and regroup.

01:49.818 --> 01:54.107

on Mr Cole's tracer.

02:31.735 --> 02:32.975
Mr Ramse.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.946
The core can't keep up
with our power demands.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.361
Between that and the toll
the splinter process takes

02:40.535 --> 02:43.117
on Mr Cole's physiology
we're losing our real-time tether.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.698
And if we lose it?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.574
Then Mr Cole is lost in time,
no way to bring him back.

that it is over.

03:23.245 --> 03:28.410
Yeah. It's gonna take time.
But we'll get there.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.871
What if Cole...?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.709
What if we didn't stop it
from happening?

03:33.839 --> 03:37.423
If his body is still there in Chechnya
then we're not safe.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.875
The plague will still happen.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.967
Let me get a meeting with Royce.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.558
Maybe we can coax him into
talking about the Wexler aftermath.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.811
Ask him if they... found anything.

03:51.940 --> 03:59.153
I'm sure they didn't, but...
could help you get some closure.

03:59.281 --> 04:02.318
Yeah. Yeah.

04:13.295 --> 04:17.379
- LASKY: We've blown the stabilizer.
- RAMSE: You better fix this quick.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.122
JONES: It can't be repaired.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.964
The only way to stabilize the core
is to replace the manifold.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.088
Mr Whitley.
There's only place we can find one.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.179
You're not serious.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.640
What choice do we have?

04:28.769 --> 04:31.226
If we don't fix the core,
the mission is over.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.970
Leaving home, all this was for nothing.

04:36.109 --> 04:40.148
It's a half-day's journey.
If I go now, I'll be there by morning.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.658
I'll prep transport.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.786
I want you to level with me.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.702
Why do you want me to go?

04:57.881 --> 05:01.794
Because you're as motivated as I am
to bring Mr Cole home.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.762
And because Spearhead can be dangerous.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.052
Things got ugly when you left?

05:11.520 --> 05:15.854
Spearhead began as a symbol of hope.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.019
After the plague,
the government collapsed,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.564
the president, advisors

05:21.738 --> 05:25.356
and all the top minds who were
still alive were transferred there.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.450
Top minds. That you?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.404
It was a safe haven
to wait out the virus.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.417
For 20 years we worked on a cure.

05:39.548 --> 05:44.087
But then the virus mutated,
and it tore through us.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.548
We gave up.

05:47.722 --> 05:53.934
The generals thought they were better
off somewhere else, Arizona, Colorado.

05:54.062 --> 05:58.305
Somewhere out in the open, fewer
bodies around carrying the virus.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.225
What happened?

06:01.403 --> 06:08.195
Colonel Foster.
His wife succumbed to the virus.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.160
He became obsessed
with finding a cure.

It was always clear to me. The only
true cure was to undo the plague.

06:45.614 --> 06:50.449
There were two "DARPA" power cores,
he kept one, and I took the other.

But they're still
trying to find the cure?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.533
(LAUGHS) It's a pointless endeavor.

The virus has mutated twice
since we left.

can survive another one.

10:11.820 --> 10:16.735

18:06.586 --> 18:09.544
Hey.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.967
DR ADLER: Are you sure about this?

18:17.096 --> 18:20.759
It's our last chance.
Mr Whitley was unsuccessful.

18:20.891 --> 18:25.134
Foster refuses to help. We're running
out of time to retrieve Mr Cole.

18:25.563 --> 18:29.431
Without the stabilizer it will put
tremendous stress on the core!

18:29.567 --> 18:30.773
We're patched in.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.568
Mr Cole is the priority.
Then we'll worry about the core.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.153
Start the generator.

18:40.661 --> 18:44.745
Listen, I think I can get out of here,
but I can't do it on my own.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.990
Do you see this beam moving?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.206
AZA: Yes!

18:48.336 --> 18:51.453
I think I can move it
but I can't do it on my own.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.795
Maybe if your dad helps.

18:52.923 --> 18:56.507
(AZA AND MIKAAIL SPEAK RUSSIAN)

18:56.636 --> 18:58.342
AZA: OK. He says he is ready.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.759
(GRUNTS)

19:07.313 --> 19:08.974
OK...

19:09.982 --> 19:14.567
On the count of three,
you pull, I push. (SIGHS)

19:15.988 --> 19:20.027
One... two...

19:20.201 --> 19:21.862
Three.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.530
Initiate return sequence.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.996
Tracer signal active.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.291
Attempting to lock on...

19:39.512 --> 19:41.127
We got him!

19:52.942 --> 19:54.978
(YELLS)

19:55.111 --> 19:58.023
(KLAXON SOUNDS)

20:08.416 --> 20:09.451
AZA: Are you OK?

20:09.583 --> 20:14.043
(GRUNTS) Yeah. I'm alive.
(COUGHS)

20:14.964 --> 20:17.751
AZA: You have a cough.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.999
Oh, it's just the dust.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.673
(KLAXON SOUNDS)

20:23.848 --> 20:25.429
The core is dead.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.924
How long will the tether hold?

20:28.060 --> 20:31.769
The entire facility's on back-up
generators, we can divert power, but...

20:31.897 --> 20:32.852
How long?!

20:32.982 --> 20:35.064
Forty-eight hours. At best.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.072
- You OK?
- Yeah.

20:55.421 --> 21:01.462
My, uh, my son... you tell him about me?

21:01.635 --> 21:03.341
No.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.177
Not because you're not worthy.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.722
Because I don't know
what his life is gonna be,

21:11.854 --> 21:14.687
who's gonna be there for him
in his future.

21:17.318 --> 21:20.401
This virus.
It's gonna keep on mutating.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.690
Foster is close to finding a cure.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.858
Oh, come on!

21:23.991 --> 21:30.908
All the doctors in the whole world,
they couldn't solve this 30 years ago.

21:31.040 --> 21:36.000
But Foster, José,
he gives you something.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.914
Something to believe in.

21:38.047 --> 21:42.290
Yeah, "You believe in me or die."

21:42.426 --> 21:43.541
That's how a coup works.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.632
Might have started that way.
But look around you.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.132
Look at everything
that he has done here.

22:00.986 --> 22:05.025
I know this is crazy.
Traveling halfway around the world

22:05.157 --> 22:07.534
to make sure someone isn't there.

22:07.701 --> 22:12.570
I can't say I'm crazy about the idea.
But you really laid into Royce.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.704
Maybe this is Haiti all over again.

22:16.168 --> 22:22.380
It's not. I get that now.
I get a lot of things now.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.257
Come with me.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.556
You need to do this on your own.

22:38.232 --> 22:41.269
Go. Get some answers.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.193
I'll be here when you get back.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.041
KID: Come on. Dad, play with me.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.247
Hey.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.789
Hi.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.716
- I'm...
- José.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.219
Yeah. You remembered.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.390
- What you got there?
- Blood cells. My mom's teaching me.

23:19.523 --> 23:25.234
Red cells carry oxygen.
White cells help you when you get sick.

23:31.285 --> 23:36.120
You're a smart kid. You wanna be
a scientist when you grow up?

23:37.875 --> 23:38.910
Nah.

23:41.253 --> 23:45.667
A smart kid like you, you gotta
know how to play the game Go.

23:47.927 --> 23:55.049
Buddy, listen. This is an ancient,
ancient Chinese game.

23:55.184 --> 24:00.520
I'm talking about this game was invented
thousands and thousands of years ago.

24:00.689 --> 24:04.022
Kings and emperors
would play this game.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.937
And they were so smart.

24:06.070 --> 24:13.283
And I think... I know you are smart
enough to win at this game.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.035
You wanna learn how to play this game?

24:18.082 --> 24:19.447
Pull out ten whites.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.253
Hey. Get ready. Things
are about to get real interesting.

24:26.382 --> 24:29.294
Pull out ten whites, ten reds.
Count them down.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.712
I'll be right back, buddy.

24:33.514 --> 24:34.629
I'll be back.

24:47.403 --> 24:51.817
Katarina. Welcome home.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.087
Where shall we talk? Your office?

25:08.215 --> 25:11.252
I think over dinner
would be more appropriate.

25:11.385 --> 25:13.626
I'd like to welcome all our guests.

25:13.762 --> 25:18.677
Charming. But I am hardly a guest here.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.223
And certainly not welcome.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.517
Indulge me.

25:37.953 --> 25:42.322
AZA: Cole? Cole? Are you there?

25:42.458 --> 25:46.246
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.915
AZA: My father went to find help.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.173
That's good.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.594
AZA: What will you do when you get out?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.178
I don't know.

26:03.228 --> 26:09.315
AZA: I know what I would do. If I could
do anything, I would have chuda.

26:09.443 --> 26:13.311
My mother, she made it the best.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.563
She's gone now. (COUGHS)

26:17.951 --> 26:19.566
- Hey.
- (AZA COUGHS)

26:19.703 --> 26:21.409
Hey. You alright?

26:21.538 --> 26:26.157
AZA: Yes. (COUGHS)
I think so. Itjust started. (COUGHS)

26:26.293 --> 26:30.912
Listen to me, you need to find
a phone and call my friend.

26:31.048 --> 26:34.757
She needs to know what's going on here.
She's a doctor. She can help you.

26:34.968 --> 26:40.463
AZA: It's OK. (COUGHS) Help is coming.
We just have to wait a little longer.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.558
(COUGHS) Help is coming.
(COUGHS)

26:44.686 --> 26:48.770
FOSTER: Bless us, Father,
for this meal that we're about to eat.

26:48.941 --> 26:53.526
For the reunion of old friends. Family.

26:53.695 --> 26:57.859
Bless us that we may
be peaceful and harmonious.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.693
Amen.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.821
- Amen.
- Amen.

27:07.876 --> 27:12.540
Your men got me up to speed.
I... I know why you're here.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.208
You wanna ask again
for the stabilizer for your core.

27:17.344 --> 27:22.964
No. This part is of no interest to me
at this point.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.681
I require your entire core.

27:24.810 --> 27:29.053
Mmm. So completely and utterly brazen.

27:29.231 --> 27:33.099
Our core has been exhausted.
We have a man, a traveler,

27:33.235 --> 27:37.604
who will be lost in time if we don't
have your core to bring him back.

27:37.739 --> 27:41.027
What part of him did you
want to bring back? An arm? A leg?

27:41.160 --> 27:45.494
Torso? I've heard about your little
temporal mishaps, dear.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.362
I've perfected the process.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.787
Perfected,
and yet here we all are, hmm?

27:53.338 --> 27:55.750
Mr Ramse, care for some more?

27:57.467 --> 27:59.207
How many men have you seen splintered

27:59.344 --> 28:02.381
only to wake and find yourself living
and breathing in the same reality?

28:03.807 --> 28:06.344
I don't wanna be involved in this.

28:06.476 --> 28:10.719
A lot of lives are at stake and you guys
are having a dick-measuring contest.

28:12.107 --> 28:18.603
Alright. Well, then, suppose I were to
give you my core to retrieve your man.

28:19.489 --> 28:24.358
Then, when it is returned,
you come back with it, Kat.

28:25.579 --> 28:28.696
And we combine our efforts
towards the cultivation of a cure.

28:28.832 --> 28:32.916
There is no cure.
And there never will be.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.496
We're losing more and more people.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.212
What is it that you wish for
that we don't already have?

28:37.341 --> 28:42.961
Besides bringing back the dead?
Have you forgotten, "Heir Frankenstein?"

28:43.138 --> 28:45.971
That was never
a part of the natural order.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.349
That our Father has provided
everything that was promised.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.508
Spare us.

28:50.646 --> 28:54.480
"Be fruitful, and multiply,
replenish the earth."

28:54.608 --> 28:58.442
You wanna chase ghosts
instead of offering men hope?

28:58.570 --> 29:01.562
(LAUGHS)

29:01.698 --> 29:03.359
Same old Jonathan.

29:06.453 --> 29:12.744
Tell me, what hope was there for the men
of Spearhead who opposed you?

29:14.294 --> 29:17.331
When you put bullets into their heads.

29:20.217 --> 29:23.425
You can take on
all the airs that you want...

29:25.347 --> 29:26.757
...but I remember...

29:29.601 --> 29:35.597
...I remember the day when
you spilled blood in the name of hope.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.847
Katarina...

29:36.984 --> 29:41.227
Yet you have nothing to show.
Just empty promises.

29:42.656 --> 29:48.993
Show us this vaccine. Show us your cure!
Show us something real.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.618
What do you have to show?

30:08.598 --> 30:10.850
Where'd you get this?

30:13.770 --> 30:16.933
Maybe now is a good time
to speak in private.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.819
How can you have these?

30:24.948 --> 30:27.189
They were all lost
in the fires when Atlanta fell.

30:27.326 --> 30:31.911
Indeed. How can I?

30:34.416 --> 30:40.582
Jonathan, you can have your wife back.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.543
And all those who were lost.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.508
And notjust them.

30:48.722 --> 30:52.806
Society, culture.

30:53.977 --> 30:57.595
Help me, help me right the past.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.847
Impossible.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.982
The man I sent back into time,
he retrieved them for me.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.907
No, no, no, no. You found them
somewhere, had them reprinted.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.699
Is that what you believe?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.370
That I am tricking you.

31:19.503 --> 31:25.123
Jonathan, if you hadn't believed

31:25.258 --> 31:27.795
in the potential of Project Splinter,

31:27.969 --> 31:30.460
you would have
put a bullet into my head, too.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.839
And now you have
the proof in your hands.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.263
These are very precious to me.

31:39.731 --> 31:43.440
But let me show you
what righting the past looks like.

31:55.163 --> 31:59.532
The past is the past.
This cure is not a memory.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.410
With your help
a vaccine could be a year away.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.130
We need the core for our servers,

32:07.300 --> 32:11.669
that algorithm is the lifeblood
of our species. See for yourself.

32:11.805 --> 32:15.923
There is only one true cure
and it's within my reach.

32:16.059 --> 32:21.053
So, you succeed, and the virus
materializes in another form?

32:22.065 --> 32:25.523
What if this, all of this,
were meant to happen

32:25.652 --> 32:27.608
so that we could find the cure.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.446
- Is this what you would tell your wife?
- Yes.

32:32.826 --> 32:36.159
And your daughter. Hannah.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.737
You're still holding on
to the memory of her.

32:39.291 --> 32:43.705
Trapped in that tiny room,
holding onto her dead little hand.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.604
Where's Sam?

33:04.733 --> 33:09.818
I put him to bed.
He was asking about you.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.447
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.608
What did he say?

33:14.075 --> 33:17.488
He wanted to know
why you didn't have hair.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.158
(BOTH LAUGH)

33:20.957 --> 33:23.369
He's a good kid.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.618
Yeah, I think so.

33:25.754 --> 33:30.839
He's handsome, like his dad.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.842
Well, I hope he gets your modesty, too.

33:34.846 --> 33:35.961
He's got your eyes.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.051
Yeah?

33:39.184 --> 33:42.927
Yeah. And your smile.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.145
He's gonna break a lot of hearts.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.780
Ramse.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.838
- I'll be back.
- You'd better.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.869
- English?
- Yes.

34:51.006 --> 34:54.498
There was an explosion in the hills
a couple weeks ago.

34:54.634 --> 34:57.626
- Yes. But now everything is OK.
- Can you take me up there?

34:57.762 --> 35:02.426
No. You cannot. Russian military
has the area off limits.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.596
How close can you get me?

35:16.698 --> 35:17.778
Miss.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.282
Foster said no?

35:28.460 --> 35:31.748
They got their own thing
going on over there.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.964
Safe, it's clean, it's organized.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.340
They said they found
a cure for the plague.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.550
There is no way
to predict the mutations.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.925
Foster's got a room full of computers,
that's why they need their core.

35:48.021 --> 35:54.108
They say that they're able to predict
when the virus is gonna change.

35:54.235 --> 35:59.355
And that they're also able to create
a cure every time it mutates.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.490
You know what that means?

36:05.580 --> 36:06.990
We don't have to go back in time.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.117
If Cole comes back,
we just move forward with our lives.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.244
DR ADLER:
We've been down this road before,

36:14.381 --> 36:17.043
chasing the virus
is a losing proposition.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.915
But maybe now it's possible.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.542
JONES: I'm afraid not.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.920
RAMSE:
You have to admit, it sounds plausible.

36:23.056 --> 36:25.012
It's a lie.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.597
A lie to keep the people
in Spearhead complacent,

36:29.729 --> 36:32.061
protect that fragile house of cards.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.181
Foster did find a cure.

36:35.318 --> 36:40.813
To the virus of 2033,
the strain that destroyed Spearhead.

36:41.408 --> 36:45.276
Not of the one we are facing now. Not of
the next mutation or the one after that.

36:46.204 --> 36:50.163
All he managed to do
is cure a strain that is already dead.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.327
It's already history.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.961
Are you sure?

36:54.087 --> 36:56.453
We need to retrieve Mr Cole.

36:56.631 --> 37:01.967
That machine is the only hope for us,
not Foster's computers.

37:02.095 --> 37:07.089
You can't save Cole
unless you take Foster's deal.

37:07.225 --> 37:11.844
Mr Ramse,
I promise you we will find a solution.

37:11.980 --> 37:16.690
But now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.869
Maybe he's right.

37:37.005 --> 37:42.716
We make a deal to use the core,
maybe then we can convince Foster...

37:43.511 --> 37:48.801
Foster's deal is just a window
into our eventual servitude!

37:49.809 --> 37:54.143
Then what do we do? Hmm?

37:56.691 --> 37:59.307
- We take their core.
- Take it how?

38:03.531 --> 38:05.738
By any means necessary.

38:16.961 --> 38:22.706
AZA: Cole! Cole, wake up! You are saved!
They are coming to get you out! (COUGHS)

38:36.356 --> 38:37.812
Take this.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.854
And give this one...

38:45.949 --> 38:47.530
...to the guard.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.951
(SIGHS)

38:53.206 --> 38:54.241
Go.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.925
AZA: Cole, just hang on. (COUGHS)

39:24.404 --> 39:27.737
- (MIKAAIL SPEAKS RUSSIAN)
- MIKAAIL: Mr Cole.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.282
Aaron, it's me.
Cole's not here. I'm sure.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.996
I've bribed officials, talked to locals,

40:19.125 --> 40:23.118
and now I'm standing in front
of the blast site, no one survived.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.539
And there's no body.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.793
He did it. (CHUCKLES)

40:27.926 --> 40:31.589
He saved the future. He was erased.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.755
(SIGHS) It's over.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.222
The virus? It got out?

40:49.906 --> 40:54.946
Of course. There's been a plague.
All over the world.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.790
What year is it? What year is this?!

41:01.876 --> 41:03.286
2017.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.962
When they tried to pull me back
Ijumped ten years.
