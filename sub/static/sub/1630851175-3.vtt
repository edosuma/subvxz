AGENT 355:
FSB, or what's left of it,

15:30.674 --> 15:34.480
put out a statement
that Russian leaders survived.

15:34.515 --> 15:36.318
12 men. The big shots.

15:36.351 --> 15:38.690
‐The inner circle.
‐Well, that's good, right?

15:38.723 --> 15:39.925
A crowd stormed the Kremlin.

15:39.958 --> 15:41.562
They wanted to see the men,

15:41.595 --> 15:43.432
but it was propaganda,
it was bullshit.

15:43.465 --> 15:45.469
They overran the building.
There's chaos now.

15:45.503 --> 15:47.874
We've lost contact.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.287
It's for Amp.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.659
‐(Amp chitters)
‐Wait, Amp's the monkey?

15:56.692 --> 15:58.328
Mm‐hmm.
Ampersand, like the, uh...

15:58.362 --> 15:59.765
I know what an ampersand is.

16:04.641 --> 16:06.512
(Yorick clears throat)

16:11.354 --> 16:13.559
The government was
handing out food in New York.

16:13.593 --> 16:16.699
Mm. Yeah, I went once.
Didn't go well.

16:16.732 --> 16:18.703
Um...

16:18.736 --> 16:22.511
so, my mom, like, uh,
won the apocalypse.

16:22.544 --> 16:23.846
That's fun.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.817
The top job.
She's not even a Republican.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.523
Well, the line of succession
was decimated.

16:29.558 --> 16:31.862
Secretary Abbot would be next.

16:31.896 --> 16:35.870
‐Is that education?
‐Yep. Except...

16:35.904 --> 16:37.708
she was born in Antigua.

16:37.741 --> 16:39.878
The only other woman was
Regina Oliver,

16:39.912 --> 16:41.649
but she's dead.

16:41.682 --> 16:43.452
Small miracles.

16:45.489 --> 16:47.527
Oh, come on, really?
She's the anti‐immigrant,

16:47.561 --> 16:48.896
anti‐government, anti‐vaxxer

16:48.930 --> 16:50.332
with a Twitter following.

16:50.365 --> 16:51.736
She, like‐‐ Didn't she, like,

16:51.769 --> 16:53.539
try and bring her gun
to a spin class?

16:53.573 --> 16:55.409
She should not be president.

16:55.442 --> 16:57.413
Well, your mom was speaker
for an hour,

16:57.446 --> 16:58.683
then they bumped her up.

16:58.716 --> 17:00.620
Oh, wow. Speaker and president.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.758
Check that off the bucket list.

17:03.793 --> 17:06.398
Between us, you don't think
it's a health risk

17:06.431 --> 17:09.003
to have a bunch of dead bodies
lying around the building?

17:09.036 --> 17:11.474
That's why that area's
sealed off.

17:11.509 --> 17:13.579
Okay, well, I'm just saying...

17:13.613 --> 17:16.017
Your mother's prioritizing
the living.

17:16.050 --> 17:17.921
Okay.

17:21.327 --> 17:23.900
(clears throat)
Yorick. That's Hamlet, right?

17:23.933 --> 17:24.968
Mm‐hmm.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.505
"Alas, poor Yorick!"

17:26.539 --> 17:27.774
"A fellow of infinite jest,

17:27.808 --> 17:30.379
of most excellent fancy."

17:30.412 --> 17:31.882
(smacks lips)

17:31.916 --> 17:34.487
My dad taught Shakespeare.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.659
They named you
after a dead clown.

17:41.569 --> 17:42.704
The plant is flooded.

17:42.737 --> 17:45.275
We're not sure what happens
when it comes back online.

17:45.309 --> 17:47.046
We obviously want to avoid
a Fukushima.

17:47.079 --> 17:49.016
MIRANDA:
There aren't enough skilled
workers to do it safely.

17:49.050 --> 17:52.056
(muted, distorted):
Not yet. We've got a handful
of engineering majors,

17:52.089 --> 17:53.058
but they're just kids.

17:53.091 --> 17:54.628
We need someone with experience.

17:54.661 --> 17:56.397
AISHA:
Most of those people are dead.

17:56.431 --> 17:58.736
The camps are bleeding fuel
we don't have.

17:58.769 --> 18:03.311
PRIYA:
If they lose power, I don't know
that we can keep the peace.

18:03.345 --> 18:05.382
AISHA:
Madam President?

18:05.415 --> 18:06.719
Ma'am?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.088
Sharon Jacobs.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.425
She runs
our re‐skilling program.

18:10.459 --> 18:12.329
Nuclear engineer since '99.
Perfect.

18:12.363 --> 18:13.699
Sharon Jacobs left.

18:13.733 --> 18:15.035
Left? What does that mean?

18:15.068 --> 18:16.939
She lost her boys, needed time.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.545
She's been working nonstop.

18:19.578 --> 18:21.515
We all have.

18:21.549 --> 18:23.318
I want to speak with her.
Get her back there.

18:23.351 --> 18:24.988
We'll bring the plant
back online, go from there.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.525
‐Right.
‐Yes, ma'am.

18:26.559 --> 18:28.563
Madam President?

18:28.596 --> 18:31.000
Uh, my mother, she's very upset.

18:31.034 --> 18:33.405
She said you were in B ring
at 5:00 a. m. What's going on?

18:33.438 --> 18:35.643
I saw her go down there.
Helped her back to her room.

18:35.677 --> 18:36.846
Is she taking anything to sleep?

18:36.879 --> 18:38.683
That stuff can make you
a little loopy.

18:38.716 --> 18:40.720
We sleep great.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.624
Good.

18:48.603 --> 18:50.439
CHRISTINE:
What was that?

18:50.472 --> 18:51.909
Hey.

18:51.942 --> 18:53.813
Are you okay?

18:55.850 --> 18:58.756
(retching)

18:58.789 --> 19:00.693
(exhales):
Oh.

19:00.727 --> 19:02.697
(panting)

19:08.441 --> 19:09.578
AGENT 355:
I warned him.

19:09.611 --> 19:10.880
He kept eating.

19:10.914 --> 19:12.149
Watch him. He bites.

19:12.182 --> 19:14.655
(chittering loudly)

19:14.688 --> 19:15.690
And he's...?

19:15.723 --> 19:16.825
Definitely a male.

19:16.859 --> 19:18.696
‐How did they survive?
‐I don't know.

19:18.729 --> 19:21.835
‐Should I get Dr. Schirra?
‐No. No. This is the circle.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.839
Until we have a plan,
he stays between us.

19:23.873 --> 19:26.110
And the pilots.

19:26.144 --> 19:28.916
(exhales)
We need a geneticist.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.954
Pull that NSF list.

19:30.987 --> 19:32.557
We'll pick the best,
bring her here.

19:32.591 --> 19:34.026
We can recommission B ring
for him.

19:34.060 --> 19:35.930
He can't stay here.
Whatever kept him alive,

19:35.964 --> 19:37.534
people are gonna want it.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.671
This is the safest place
he could be.

19:39.705 --> 19:41.542
5,000 people live and work
in this building.

19:41.575 --> 19:43.411
The crowd at the gate grows
every day.

19:43.445 --> 19:45.415
So what do you think happens
if they find out

19:45.449 --> 19:47.954
the only survivor is
the president's son?

19:47.988 --> 19:50.660
I can help you move him, but...

19:50.693 --> 19:53.064
it has to be
before the word gets out.

19:53.098 --> 19:54.701
Ma'am, secrets don't hold.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.672
You need to work
outside the system.

19:56.705 --> 19:58.676
She's the president‐‐
she is the system.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.813
Can you trust her?

20:01.849 --> 20:02.951
Yes.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.487
Because the fewer people

20:04.521 --> 20:05.957
who know about him, the better.

20:05.990 --> 20:07.661
JENNIFER:
She knows. Move on.

20:07.694 --> 20:09.463
AGENT 355:
He's valuable.

20:09.498 --> 20:11.635
He's probably
the most valuable asset we have,

20:11.669 --> 20:13.104
and he needs to be protected.

20:13.138 --> 20:15.743
But not here.

20:15.777 --> 20:17.514
This place is a fishbowl.

20:17.547 --> 20:19.584
Ma'am, use me.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.056
This is what I'm here for.

20:22.089 --> 20:24.193
JENNIFER:
I just got him back.

20:24.226 --> 20:26.899
I won't lose him again.

20:36.117 --> 20:38.455
Where am I?

20:40.627 --> 20:42.631
(woman speaks Hebrew)

20:45.570 --> 20:47.473
There you are.

20:49.010 --> 20:51.715
I'm... so thirsty.

20:51.749 --> 20:54.588
(speaking Hebrew)

20:58.094 --> 21:00.032
Where am I?

21:01.067 --> 21:02.537
Tel Aviv.

21:02.570 --> 21:04.975
Can you tell me your name?

21:05.008 --> 21:07.914
Do you remember?

21:07.947 --> 21:10.485
The CCI summit.

21:14.226 --> 21:16.498
Your esophagus will be
quite tender.

21:16.532 --> 21:18.234
We just removed the tube
yesterday,

21:18.268 --> 21:19.838
‐so not too much.
‐Oh...

21:19.871 --> 21:22.109
What... what happened?

21:24.146 --> 21:25.650
A lot.

21:25.683 --> 21:27.754
Everything.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.156
Regina.

21:29.190 --> 21:32.530
(exhales)
My name is Regina.

21:32.564 --> 21:35.770
Regina. Nice to meet you.

21:35.803 --> 21:37.139
I'm Alma.

21:41.548 --> 21:44.186
Forgive me, uh...

21:44.220 --> 21:47.092
I expect this will be
difficult news, but...

21:47.126 --> 21:50.800
there isn't a way to say it
more simply.

21:50.833 --> 21:54.608
There's... been an event,

21:54.641 --> 21:57.212
the world over, and...

21:59.350 --> 22:01.855
...the men are dead, Regina.

22:03.191 --> 22:06.865
I can't explain it, uh,
but that is what has happened.

22:06.899 --> 22:08.602
Everywhere.

22:08.636 --> 22:10.873
They're gone.

22:10.907 --> 22:13.011
I'm... I'm sure
you'll have many people

22:13.044 --> 22:15.550
that you will have to grieve.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.687
You were in an accident.

22:17.721 --> 22:20.960
Your skull was fractured
and your brain was swelling.

22:20.993 --> 22:23.264
And all of that...

22:23.298 --> 22:25.970
and you survived.

22:26.003 --> 22:28.108
And you'll survive this, too.

22:30.378 --> 22:31.749
If that's true...

22:31.782 --> 22:33.786
It's true, Regina.
I know it seems...

22:33.819 --> 22:38.161
...then I am the President
of the United States.

22:40.967 --> 22:43.271
Could I have more water, please?

22:48.883 --> 22:50.753

23:17.841 --> 23:19.845

23:31.735 --> 23:34.206
‐Has there been a breakthrough?
‐Excuse me?

23:35.242 --> 23:38.381
Uh, scientists. I thought
maybe there was some good news.

23:38.414 --> 23:40.720
Oh, I... I'm just the courier.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.222
Why don't I know you?

23:42.256 --> 23:44.928
You're Secret Service, right?
You worked for my father?

23:44.961 --> 23:46.765
‐Yes.
‐Oh. Have we met?

23:46.799 --> 23:48.936
I'm usually pretty good
with names and faces.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.809
Sarah Burgin. But it was
my first day on the job

23:51.842 --> 23:52.944
when it happened.

23:52.977 --> 23:54.848
Oh.

23:54.881 --> 23:57.119
Oh, you poor thing. How awful.

23:57.152 --> 23:59.791
Um, well...

23:59.825 --> 24:02.697
President Brown has shown
a real interest in you.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.033
My father had
his favorites, too.

24:04.066 --> 24:06.304
So you must be doing
a great job.

24:06.337 --> 24:09.176
(chuckles):
Oh, uh, I'm, uh, I'm Kimberly.

24:09.210 --> 24:11.982
‐Kim. Sorry, I should have...
‐I know who you are. Yes.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.220
...started with that, yeah.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.292
Um... I play cards

24:17.326 --> 24:20.031
with some of the Secret Service
girls sometimes.

24:20.065 --> 24:21.668
You should join us.

24:21.702 --> 24:23.238
It's good to have friends here.

24:23.271 --> 24:25.743
You know,
President Brown can be...

24:26.778 --> 24:28.849
...tough.
(sighs)

24:30.753 --> 24:32.422
Thank you.

24:32.456 --> 24:34.460
It was nice meeting you.

24:34.494 --> 24:36.130
Okay.

24:39.069 --> 24:40.907
ELAINE:
Your hair...

24:40.940 --> 24:42.911
‐KIMBERLY (laughs): Oh.
‐How did you...?

24:42.944 --> 24:45.448
Hey. Ashley, let Kailyn play.

24:46.484 --> 24:50.826
I traded a cashmere shawl
with Wendy for it.

24:50.860 --> 24:52.897
It's the cheap stuff,
but it does the trick.

24:52.931 --> 24:55.335
I thought
if I looked more like myself,

24:55.368 --> 24:57.406
they would take me
more seriously.

24:57.439 --> 24:59.410
But Jennifer still acts
like I'm useless.

24:59.443 --> 25:01.347
‐Mom!
‐Give her a turn.

25:01.380 --> 25:03.084
ASHLEY:
Stop it. Get off of me.

25:03.117 --> 25:05.890
Oh, come on, you don't
have to like Jennifer,

25:05.923 --> 25:07.927
‐Mom!
‐but she's doing
the best she can.

25:07.961 --> 25:09.931
I will not ask you again!

25:09.965 --> 25:13.037
She's doing the best she can
to sideline us. (scoffs)

25:13.071 --> 25:15.442
My mother worked hand in hand
with my father

25:15.475 --> 25:16.812
his entire career.

25:16.845 --> 25:18.816
She should have a voice.

25:18.849 --> 25:22.089
Kim, we all love your mom,
but she's...

25:23.191 --> 25:26.063
‐...she doesn't want...
‐My mother's fine, Elaine.

25:26.097 --> 25:29.403
If we had some real
representation in that room...

25:29.436 --> 25:30.773
We've got Lisa.

25:30.806 --> 25:31.909
Lisa Murray?

25:31.942 --> 25:34.380
Hmm! Please. She's pro‐choice.

25:34.413 --> 25:35.850
She's a Republican.

25:35.883 --> 25:38.154
Hardly.
Look, the voters chose us.

25:38.187 --> 25:40.125
They chose my father.

25:40.158 --> 25:41.962
They chose your husband.

25:41.995 --> 25:43.999
Our values.

25:44.033 --> 25:46.370
You worked with Peter
on his entire campaign.

25:46.404 --> 25:48.509
You should have a seat
at the table.

25:48.542 --> 25:50.145
‐Me?
‐Why not?

25:50.178 --> 25:51.515
I'm a homemaker.

25:52.550 --> 25:56.023
Peter didn't run that office
all by himself.

25:56.057 --> 25:58.862
When I walk down the halls,
the way people look at me...

25:58.896 --> 26:00.866
Nobody's asking you

26:00.900 --> 26:02.402
‐what you're still doing here.
‐ASHLEY: Come on!

26:02.436 --> 26:03.939
Ashley, that's it!

26:03.973 --> 26:05.977
I'm counting to five.

26:07.012 --> 26:08.782
One.

26:08.816 --> 26:10.318
Two.

26:10.352 --> 26:12.456
Three.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.993
