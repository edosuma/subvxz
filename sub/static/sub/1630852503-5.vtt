00:11.011 --> 00:14.405
<i>Previously on</i> Good Sam... I spoke with the board.

00:14.449 --> 00:15.928
They're not just gonna hand you
the reins at the end of this.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.887
They're gonna choose between us.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.062
The next time
you want to help me,

00:19.106 --> 00:20.281
don't screw my best friend!

00:21.282 --> 00:23.414
It was good back then.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.808
We... cannot go back
to the way it was.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.941
She's starting a war <i>
she can't win.</i>

00:28.985 --> 00:32.162
You let Lakeshore lose
an eight-figure donation.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.772
And pinned it on me.

00:33.816 --> 00:36.384
I did tell you that
the lesson was gonna hurt.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.603
I assume you're here to collect
on our agreement.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.867
What exactly do you have planned
for my father?

00:41.911 --> 00:43.173
This isn't about your father.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.175
It's your mother
we need to talk about.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.747
The day your whole life changes

00:51.790 --> 00:56.447
<i>starts like any other day.</i>

00:56.491 --> 00:58.623
<i>You wake up...</i>

00:58.667 --> 01:00.756
<i>and life is just</i> <i>
how you left it.</i>

01:00.799 --> 01:03.106
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.761
<i>Sometimes that's a good thing.</i>

01:07.154 --> 01:09.547
<i>Sometimes it's not.</i>

01:11.027 --> 01:13.334
<i>Mostly...</i>

01:13.377 --> 01:16.206
<i>...it's just another day.</i>

01:19.079 --> 01:20.906
<i>And that's when it happens.</i>

01:20.950 --> 01:22.734
55-year-old male,

01:22.778 --> 01:24.910
<i>single gunshot wound</i> <i>
to the chest and hypotensive.</i>

01:24.954 --> 01:26.173
<i>Inbound now.</i>

01:26.216 --> 01:27.696
Someone points a gun,

01:27.739 --> 01:29.132
<i>pulls the trigger.</i>

01:29.176 --> 01:30.916
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

01:30.960 --> 01:33.354
you're being supervised by
a surgeon decades your junior,

01:33.397 --> 01:36.705
whose experience and expertise
bear no comparison to your own.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.577
It is tragic, really.

01:39.621 --> 01:42.014
Kind of making it all about you,
aren't you?

01:42.058 --> 01:43.886
Well, gunshot wounds have
that effect on me.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.322
Thank you for your
insights, Doctor.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.411
Perhaps we can focus
on today's case.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.283
Yeah, you're right.
Got to fix him up

01:49.326 --> 01:51.720
before a subordinate
swipes his job.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.418
Deep down, he doesn't
really mean that.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.290
Deep down, yes,
he really does.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.161
.30 caliber GSW
to the abdomen.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.858
His hunting partner accidentally
shot him from about 30 feet.

01:59.902 --> 02:00.903
- Exit wound?
- No.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.992
Start a large-bore IV.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.167
Get all the O negative
you can carry.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.821
There's so much blood.

02:05.864 --> 02:06.952
How bad is it?

02:06.996 --> 02:08.128
Please...

02:08.171 --> 02:10.391
don't let me die.

02:11.696 --> 02:14.003
<i>[gunshot, screaming]</i><i>
Single shot from behind.</i>

02:14.046 --> 02:16.223
Bullet - exited through the abdomen.
Prep an OR!

02:16.266 --> 02:18.094
Dad. Shh.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.226
Try not to talk.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.490
Don't...

02:22.533 --> 02:24.231
don't let me die.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.580
I won't.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.538
Dad?

02:27.582 --> 02:29.192
Dad.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.064
<i>Dad?</i>

02:32.108 --> 02:33.457
Are you with us?

02:47.558 --> 02:48.994
Let's get him on the monitors.
Hang two units.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.083
- How's the FAST?
- Hemopericardium.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.563
Right. We got to remove
the blood from around the heart.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.392
Pericardiocentesis,
needle and syringe.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.220
Carl?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.048
I'm his wife. The paramedics
took forever to get here.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.223
Is he okay?

03:00.267 --> 03:01.659
- Carl!
- No, no.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.052
He's coding.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.836
Carl!
18-gauge needle.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.317
60cc syringe. Skin prep.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.276
- Skin prep!
- No!

03:09.972 --> 03:11.060
No.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.759
You do not have privileges

03:14.803 --> 03:16.718
to touch patients,
do you understand me?

03:16.761 --> 03:17.980
I'm doing it.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.159
Stand down, Doctor.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.946
Let's get him to the OR.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.774
Not you.

03:29.818 --> 03:32.081
- What? You need me in there.
- You're family.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.691
You need another set of hands.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.040
I mean, hemorrhage
control alone... It's a no.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.738
I'll scrub in.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.348
Okay.

03:39.523 --> 03:42.483
I got him. Okay. Okay.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.441
Two units are in.
He's still tachy,

03:44.485 --> 03:46.182
- but his pressure's stabilizing.
- Okay. Let's get him to imaging.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.923
I need to see how much damage
this bullet did.
Okay.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.756
That was intense.

03:54.799 --> 03:57.889
Yeah. Thank you
for stepping in.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.892
Gunshot wounds are hard enough
without him grabbing instruments

04:00.936 --> 04:04.026
- behind my back.
- He was just trying to help.

04:04.069 --> 04:06.158
I'm not defending him.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.509
He can't touch patients,
and he shouldn't.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.380
But, you know,
sometimes instinct takes over.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.381
I get that.

04:11.425 --> 04:12.687
I really do.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.950
But he acts like
this proctorship is

04:14.993 --> 04:18.301
something that I'm doing to him
and not for him,

04:18.345 --> 04:19.520
and...

04:20.564 --> 04:23.263
- Is it weird to talk about him?
- Yeah, it's weird.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.134
But I think we have
to talk about it

04:25.177 --> 04:27.441
if we're gonna get
back to normal.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.312
Probably right.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.358
For the record,
I'm glad we're talking,

04:31.401 --> 04:33.664
- even if it's weird.
- Me, too.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.494
- Why are we hiding?
- Rhonda.

04:37.538 --> 04:38.887
I owe her a favor,

04:38.930 --> 04:39.931
and I have been trying
to put her off...

04:41.411 --> 04:42.760
...as long as I can.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.153
How are you gonna do that
when you have

04:44.196 --> 04:45.415
the department chiefs'
meeting today?

04:45.459 --> 04:47.025
Oh, that's right.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.200
Hey.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.898
It's a good thing.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.422
It's your first year
representing the department.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.816
I know,
and I'm very excited about it.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.165
- Mm-hmm.
- But, you know...

04:56.208 --> 04:57.166
Rhonda.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.997
Why is my mom paging me?

05:02.040 --> 05:04.216
Why is your mom paging me?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.397
Why is Pyne in
the surgeons' lounge?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.050
He is a doctor here.

05:12.094 --> 05:13.530
- Psychiatry is not surgery.
- Psychiatry is not surgery.

05:13.574 --> 05:14.705
So...

05:14.749 --> 05:16.403
do you, uh,
mind explaining to me

05:16.446 --> 05:18.666
what just happened
in the ER?

05:18.709 --> 05:20.929
Difference of opinion.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.540
It was a tug-of-war over
a pericardiocentesis needle,

05:23.584 --> 05:24.933
and it is not acceptable.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.630
I've asked Dr. Pyne
to come here today

05:26.674 --> 05:29.111
to make sure
this doesn't happen again.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.591
Thank you.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.028
Let's begin with
a deep, cleansing breath.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.377
First we inhale.

05:36.074 --> 05:39.164
Then exhale.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.383
Sorry.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.645
Pyne, that was,
that was...

05:41.689 --> 05:44.909
That's an inhale
and then an exhale?

05:44.953 --> 05:47.129
No, he said exhale first.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.479
So n-- not inhale?

05:49.523 --> 05:50.959
Would you go over it again?

05:51.002 --> 05:52.482
I think we're a little confused.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.876
If you two were as unified
with the patient

05:54.919 --> 05:57.269
as you are
in your dislike of me,

05:57.313 --> 05:59.141
perhaps we wouldn't be here
in the first place.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.969
Can we just agree it won't
happen again and move on?

06:01.012 --> 06:02.318
That's a good start,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.320
but I'm interested in
why it happened.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.148
If we can excavate
some emotions,

06:06.191 --> 06:08.019
I feel we can...

06:09.151 --> 06:10.631
Sorry. Carry on.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.068
We can prevent future incidents.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.939
Sorry.

06:16.114 --> 06:19.770
Dr. Pyne is offering
his services to anyone

06:19.814 --> 06:21.250
who would like to talk,

06:21.293 --> 06:23.208
and so, I suggest
you take him up on it.

06:23.252 --> 06:26.298
I can't have your emotions
clouding your judgment.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.126
That's absolutely right.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.432
You should book
a double session with him.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.956
Humor as a defense mechanism.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.393
It's understandable,
given how much

06:33.436 --> 06:34.872
you have in common
with this patient.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.918
I have nothing in common
with him.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.659
Really?

06:38.702 --> 06:40.530
A father, in his prime,

06:40.574 --> 06:43.533
shot through no fault
of his own.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.056
I could be describing you.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.450
Well, as you're talking,
I'm struck by the fact

06:47.494 --> 06:51.019
that you... you actually charge
for this stuff.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.716
You don't see the similarities.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.849
Then what happened in the ER?

06:54.892 --> 06:57.112
- Ask her.
- How is this my fault?

06:57.155 --> 06:58.461
You stepped between me
and a patient.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.158
To prevent you from violating

07:00.202 --> 07:01.769
the legal terms
of your proctorship.

07:01.812 --> 07:04.467
- To show me who's boss.
- That is not what this was.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.556
You want to know the difference
between me and this patient?

07:07.601 --> 07:09.298
- Enlighten us.
- The bullet exited my body.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.300
It's stuck inside his.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.911
He's semiconscious.
I was comatose.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.436
He was out hunting.
I was shot in my place of work.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.915
The list goes on,

07:17.959 --> 07:19.830
culminating in our presumably
opposing stances

07:19.874 --> 07:21.266
on gun control,

07:21.310 --> 07:22.746
but the biggest difference is

07:22.790 --> 07:25.532
that his family saw his shooting
as a tragedy,

07:25.575 --> 07:28.622
and mine saw it
as a career opportunity.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.289
<i>Dr. Griffith,</i> <i>
I handed your department</i>

07:44.333 --> 07:46.335
<i>a multimillion-dollar donor.</i>

07:46.378 --> 07:47.728
We had a deal.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.643
Our deal was about my dad.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.993
Our deal was I help you,
you help me.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.777
I never specified
the nature of the favor.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.997
Okay.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.739
Fine. Let's get
this over with.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.741
As you know, I own
a chain of surgical centers

08:00.784 --> 08:02.307
under the Lakeshore banner.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.961
They make a lot of money.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.485
But most of that money goes
back to the hospital.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.964
Well, the hospital's name is
over the door.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.488
That's what brings
all the patients in.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.055
My skill at crafting
the perfect breast is

08:11.099 --> 08:12.535
what brings them in.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.581
Lakeshore gets 60%
of what I make.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.234
Does that seem fair to you?

08:16.278 --> 08:18.454
I have been trying
to renegotiate my profit split

08:18.498 --> 08:19.673
with your mother for years.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.413
I just keep getting the Heisman.

08:21.457 --> 08:23.154
So, you want me
to talk to my mom?

08:23.198 --> 08:25.330
No, I want you to bring it up
at the chiefs' meeting.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.810
She can say no to me,
but not to a room

08:26.854 --> 08:28.856
full of chiefs
demanding fair pay.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.206
I don't have a surgical center.

08:31.249 --> 08:34.775
Just bring it up, and your debt
to me will be paid in full.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.778
Fine.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.475
First, I'm gonna help
my patient,

08:39.519 --> 08:40.911
and then I will help you.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.087
See you at the meeting.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.397
Ugh.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.007
Tim's checking in again
about the gunshot case.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.966
I already told him
we don't know anything yet.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.881
Well, maybe he's
checking in on you.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.012
Why?

08:55.056 --> 08:57.449
Because he loves you.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.277
Because it was traumatic.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.192
He's a paramedic.
Trauma pays our bills.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.498
People get shot every day.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.108
Indeed they do,
Dr. Costa.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.502
I'd like an update on
the patient's blood volume

09:06.546 --> 09:08.025
and an updated creatinine to see

09:08.069 --> 09:09.766
how his kidneys are responding
to the fluids.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.246
Mm-hmm.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.423
Thank you.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.123
- How you doing?
- Hmm?

09:19.167 --> 09:21.430
Oh, I'm always a little on edge
after a shooting,

09:21.473 --> 09:23.127
and Griff isn't even my father.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.694
Are you saying I'm on edge?

09:24.738 --> 09:25.913
No, no, no. Not saying that.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.436
Just saying that if you were,

09:27.479 --> 09:29.612
and if you wanted
to talk about it,

09:29.656 --> 09:31.092
we could.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.573
But you aren't, so we won't.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.400
CT scans just came in.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.098
Good.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.970
The bullet's lodged

09:40.014 --> 09:41.363
at the bottom
of the aortic arch.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.583
Wow, a millimeter further
and he'd be dead.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.846
Looks like the impact
injured the vessel wall.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.630
Mm, you're right.
Pseudoaneurysm.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.415
Luckily, it's small
and asymptomatic.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.852
For now.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.331
He's still coagulopathic
from the trauma.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.506
If we go in
to remove that bullet,

09:54.550 --> 09:56.160
we risk uncontrolled bleeding.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.206
He's being transfused
with packed red blood cells

09:58.249 --> 09:59.511
and clotting factors
as we speak.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.296
Good. So we wait.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.254
We'll monitor
the pseudoaneurysm closely.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.821
Leave that bullet in, it could erode to the aortic wall

10:04.865 --> 10:07.258
or dislodge entirely.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.826
Both highly unlikely.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.654
If we give him time,

10:11.698 --> 10:13.525
his hemostatic abnormalities
could correct on their own.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.919
The worst thing a heart surgeon
can do is hope for the best.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.921
The bullet has to come out.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.575
The bullet stays in for now.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.924
I want Q1 hour updates
on his labs

10:20.968 --> 10:22.012
so we can get him in an OR

10:22.056 --> 10:23.274
when he's stable.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.332
What are you doing?

10:37.375 --> 10:40.857
nothing.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.077
If you're going to put protocols
ahead of patient care...

10:43.120 --> 10:45.557
This proctorship is not
a punishment.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.603
I am trying
to help you get there.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.779
By tying my hands during
an emergent procedure?

10:49.823 --> 10:52.434
I understand how you feel.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.523
You couldn't possibly.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.699
You don't think that I felt
helpless after you got shot?

10:56.743 --> 10:59.397
I know exactly
how devastating it is

10:59.441 --> 11:01.617
to want to help
and not be able to do anything.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.185
Well, you seem to have got
over it.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.111
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.159
You don't have to keep
checking up on me.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.465
You aren't answering my texts.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.336
I just couldn't find
the right emoji

11:25.380 --> 11:27.338
for "gunshot patient
stable, as am I."

11:28.383 --> 11:30.733
Well, it's okay if you're not,
you know.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.866
Even Sam and Griff were rattled
by that whole scene.

11:32.909 --> 11:35.520
Well, they lack my advantage
in times like these.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.522
What advantage is that?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.699
The fact that I'm
well-suited for stress.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.920
So, you sat up
talking to yourself

11:43.964 --> 11:45.835
the night your Uncle Terry died?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.925
Or when your passport was stolen
in Rio, you talked yourself

11:48.969 --> 11:50.840
out of a panic attack
at the U.S. Embassy?

11:50.884 --> 11:52.581
Okay, hold on a minute... Yeah, and you-you got yourself

11:52.624 --> 11:54.714
through these last three years
of residency by, what,

11:54.757 --> 11:56.716
being naturally well-suited
for stress?

11:56.759 --> 11:58.195
I never said that you had... The thing is, Joey,

11:58.239 --> 12:01.198
is that people actually believe
this act of yours.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.461
Dr. Costa,
he doesn't need anybody.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.899
And they don't know that
I have been here the whole time,

12:05.942 --> 12:08.336
supporting you,
holding you up.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.425
They don't see me.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.821
But I thought you did.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.563
- Tim.
- Don't.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.699
Well, good work, everyone.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.527
- Any other business?
- Uh, I'm new here,

12:25.570 --> 12:27.703
but I do have
a topic to raise.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.357
Go ahead, Dr. Griffith.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.272
It's about the outpatient
surgical centers

12:31.315 --> 12:32.621
affiliated with Lakeshore.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.275
- What about them?
- Well...

12:34.318 --> 12:36.581
everyone works equally hard
to run those centers.

12:36.625 --> 12:41.151
And, um, shouldn't everyone
be compensated equally?

12:41.195 --> 12:44.764
The, uh, budget committee meets,
when, next quarter?

12:44.807 --> 12:46.809
Let's table it until then.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.811
Who says we aren't
being compensated equally?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.073
How would we know?

12:50.117 --> 12:51.771
You can't.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.251
Not without violating
confidentiality agreements.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.427
It's fine.
I'm sure we all make

12:56.471 --> 12:58.821
the same 40%,40?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.910
- I get 30.
- I only get 25.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.651
This makes no sense.
- I get 35.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.522
I don't see how this
- can be fair.
- Did you know about this?

13:04.566 --> 13:06.176
Uh...

13:06.220 --> 13:08.483
Rhonda's cut is
the highest here.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.093
Mm-hmm.
My eyes have been opened.

13:10.137 --> 13:13.444
Dr. Katz, how do you explain
this inequity?

13:13.488 --> 13:14.794
I asked the question.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.839
My mother shouldn't
have to answer...

13:16.883 --> 13:18.623
- I want to renegotiate my deal.
- What are you gonna do about it, Vivian?

13:18.667 --> 13:21.017
I will take this matter
into consideration.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.367
Meeting adjourned.

13:24.368 --> 13:27.241
I told you not to get involved
with Rhonda.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.504
This is a political nightmare
for me, Sam.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.680
I didn't know she had
the biggest split.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.769
You also don't know
that the splits are based

13:33.813 --> 13:35.727
on the profit
each center generates.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.729
Giving everyone the same
split sounds good,

13:37.773 --> 13:39.557
but it doesn't make
financial sense.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.038
You're right.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.214
I am the CMO. This is my lane.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.738
Do I tell you how to perform
your surgeries?

13:46.782 --> 13:48.697
I want to help make this right.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.133
There has to be a solution.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.614
There is, an expensive one.

13:52.657 --> 13:55.312
I need to find half
a million dollars in my budget

13:55.356 --> 13:57.314
that I already know
I don't have.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.316
Unless I want to face a mutiny.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.372
I'd like to wait
for the swelling to go down

14:11.415 --> 14:13.417
before removing the bullet.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.332
We just don't want to put him
under more stress

14:15.376 --> 14:16.943
- than he can handle.
- That's good.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.466
Let's wait.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.164
It'll give my son
time to get here.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.036
The visibility was so bad today,

14:23.079 --> 14:25.734
I told him not to go hunting.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.044
If I had known

14:31.087 --> 14:33.437
how this day was going to end...

14:33.481 --> 14:35.962
It's not over.
He just needs time to heal.

14:36.005 --> 14:39.400
Someone came to ask
if he has a DNR.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.445
That can't be a good sign.

14:41.489 --> 14:44.318
We are doing everything we can.

14:56.460 --> 15:00.073
Why are they asking
about his DNR?

15:00.116 --> 15:01.422
H-He just got out of surgery,

15:01.465 --> 15:03.598
Anders said that it went well.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.165
He also said that

15:05.208 --> 15:07.471
your father's DNR is, um...

15:07.515 --> 15:08.951
It's not on file.

15:08.995 --> 15:12.346
We have to find it, and I, um...

15:12.389 --> 15:14.043
I just...

15:17.220 --> 15:19.135
I don't even know
where to look for it.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.181
I don't know
where our divorce papers are.

15:21.224 --> 15:24.097
- It's been so long.
- I will find the DNR.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.576
Thank you.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.362
We're not gonna need it,
but I will find it.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.586
I, uh...

15:35.630 --> 15:36.936
I should go upstairs.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.763
I've got a million fires
to put out.

15:38.807 --> 15:39.939
Okay.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.157
Are you coming?

15:41.201 --> 15:43.638
No, I'm gonna stay
a little longer.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.770
Just in case anything changes.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.165
Okay.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.811
Okay, I've got a good one
for you.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.771
68-year-old male with worsening
shortness of breath

16:29.814 --> 16:31.686
found to be in
advanced heart failure.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.122
Now, I know that you would say

16:33.166 --> 16:35.081
he's a classic LVAD candidate,
but...

16:35.124 --> 16:38.432
what if his decline is related
to his thyroid condition?

16:38.475 --> 16:40.782
If we can get his A-fib
under control,

16:40.825 --> 16:42.958
it might allow
for some cardiac recovery.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.264
Thoughts?

16:44.307 --> 16:46.005
Did you sleep here again?

16:49.095 --> 16:50.661
Something can change
at any moment.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.054
I just don't want to miss it.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.882
Sam, it's been weeks.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.492
And with you down here,

16:55.536 --> 16:57.233
I am out a department head
and a surgeon.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.235
The department is unraveling.

16:59.279 --> 17:00.932
I just...

17:00.976 --> 17:03.370
I just need to know
what your plans are here.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.720
I don't...

17:05.763 --> 17:07.939
- Shh. Do you hear that?
- What?

17:07.983 --> 17:09.767
The tempo changed.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.814
I need a crash cart
in here, now!

17:12.857 --> 17:15.338
Sam, what are you... He's about to code!

17:20.735 --> 17:22.128
Do we know his orders?

17:22.171 --> 17:24.086
I never found a DNR. Go!

17:25.827 --> 17:27.220
Charging to 200.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.526
Clear.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.490
Charge it again.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.364
Clear.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.503
Okay, he's back in sinus tach.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.809
- Come on, Dad.
- Come on.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.333
Come back.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.077
Dad.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.428
Um...

18:01.471 --> 18:03.647
I've been thinking about
what happened earlier,

18:03.691 --> 18:06.433
and I think it is time
to give you this.

18:08.391 --> 18:11.394
Instruments and manual assessment.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.832
You've passed your motor skills
and your dexterity assessments.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.486
I'd planned on
signing off on implements

18:16.530 --> 18:19.098
next week, per the schedule,
but you're ready now.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.882
- Mm-hmm.
- And after this, you'll advance

18:20.925 --> 18:23.145
to second assist during surgery,
then first assist...

18:23.189 --> 18:24.277
I know how it works.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.019
I thought you would be happy
about this.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.891
Happy?

18:29.934 --> 18:31.371
You get to lay hands
on patients again.

18:31.414 --> 18:32.546
I get to take blood pressure,

18:32.589 --> 18:34.025
change bandages.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.072
This is supposed to feel
like a win.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.074
Compared to what I've lost?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.903
Okay, I'm doing the best I can
- here.
- Well, I'm not.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.818
I'm not doing anything.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.167
This isn't a win.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.777
It isn't even
a consolation prize.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.039
If you gave Picasso
finger paints,

18:48.083 --> 18:50.390
you think he'd say thank you?

19:03.751 --> 19:05.100
I am sorry what I said
- upset you.
- No.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.797
- I'm sorry that you feel upset?
- Still no.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.364
Oh, come on, Donna,
give me a break.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.236
I'm sorry, Dr. Costa.
I'm just not buying it.

19:10.279 --> 19:13.369
How can he think
I take him for granted?

19:13.413 --> 19:14.762
We live together.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.199
- That doesn't say it all?
- Mm. Not necessarily.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.592
You could be roommates.

19:18.635 --> 19:19.767
Or cellmates.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.943
Rhonda Glass please.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.684
This is the third time
I've called.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.729
Tell her to call me back.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.949
Have you considered just telling
him that you appreciate him?

19:27.992 --> 19:29.864
When was the last time
you thanked him

19:29.907 --> 19:31.082
for everything he does?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.606
I thought it was implied.

19:32.649 --> 19:33.737
Okay.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.827
Carl's numbers are not
what we'd hoped.

19:36.871 --> 19:37.915
He's still acidotic.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.135
His INR is elevated.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.658
I want to rerun his labs.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.095
And I'd like to increase
the dosage on his TXA drip.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.054
Dr. Griffith.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.273
Why don't you handle that?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.410
You cleared him
- to administer meds.
- Yeah.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.629
Among other things.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.805
That's a big step.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.503
Will you let me know
when you have those labs please?

20:00.547 --> 20:01.983
Thanks.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.377
What's going on here?

20:50.336 --> 20:51.902
I don't know, I...

20:51.946 --> 20:53.730
I was just...

20:55.384 --> 20:56.864
The shooting.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.300
There was a shooting.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.562
It was a doctor like me.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.955
Uh, no.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.739
- Much better than me, actually.
- Lakeshore.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.524
Yeah, we got the call
about that.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.004
Did he make it?

21:07.048 --> 21:08.484
You would know
if you weren't passed out

21:08.528 --> 21:09.920
in this parking lot
all night...

21:09.964 --> 21:11.618
Dr. Tucker.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.142
I see so many bodies,

21:14.185 --> 21:17.319
cut open, but...

21:17.363 --> 21:18.929
you know, seeing him like that,
I just...

21:18.973 --> 21:20.801
I couldn't take it.

21:20.844 --> 21:21.976
Sam.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.114
I need to go.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.203
No. Step out of the car, please.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.509
I just...

21:33.553 --> 21:34.858
I really need to get back
to the hospital.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.643
Look.
Either I take you home,

21:36.686 --> 21:39.341
you get cleaned up
and get yourself some help...

21:39.385 --> 21:41.256
or I bring you in
on suspicion of a DUI

21:41.300 --> 21:43.650
and have the court
order you to do it.

21:45.652 --> 21:48.959
They say, "When you hit <i>
rock bottom, stop digging."</i>

21:49.003 --> 21:51.266
So I did.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.705
I have wondered
what happened to you that day

21:55.749 --> 21:57.577
so many times.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.580
Failing you was my low point,

22:00.623 --> 22:03.496
but it made me
turn my life around.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.672
And I've been sober ever since.

22:05.715 --> 22:08.544
You've been in recovery
for months?

22:08.588 --> 22:10.981
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner,

22:11.025 --> 22:13.767
but I want you to know
that you can talk to me.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.943
I've changed,

22:15.986 --> 22:17.248
and I know that

22:17.292 --> 22:19.033
that's probably hard to believe.

22:19.076 --> 22:22.341
So I thought hearing
the whole story might help.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.779
It does help.

22:27.258 --> 22:28.782
Thank you.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.833
Hey. How could you drag
my mother into this?

22:36.877 --> 22:39.575
Her practices are unfair,
and she got caught.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.621
Oh, please.
You don't care about fair.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.100
Your rhinoplasties alone
make more money

22:43.144 --> 22:45.146
than Dr. Bhatt's
entire GI center.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.669
I didn't pick
the man's specialty.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.149
There's no money in bowels.

22:48.192 --> 22:50.543
And what, getting
ten grand a tummy tuck

22:50.586 --> 22:51.892
isn't enough for you?

22:51.935 --> 22:53.328
I charge more than that.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.634
And being told
how much of my money

22:54.677 --> 22:58.115
I get to keep
really chaps my ass.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.518
Hey, Mom.

23:09.562 --> 23:12.260
I have an idea how to undo
this whole Rhonda mess.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.088
Okay? Call me back.

23:15.959 --> 23:19.789
I don't mean to brag,
but you're basically getting

23:19.833 --> 23:21.878
a sponge bath
from a world-class surgeon.

23:28.189 --> 23:29.973
You got a raw deal, pal.

23:32.323 --> 23:36.197
But you've got a family
that needs you, so...

23:36.240 --> 23:37.981
there's still time.

23:38.025 --> 23:40.767
Things can turn around.

23:45.293 --> 23:48.035
How long has his hand
been twitching like that?

23:49.253 --> 23:50.820
He's having a seizure.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.605
Pseudoaneurysm is
throwing off microthrombi.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.345
I need two milligrams
IV lorazepam

23:54.389 --> 23:55.477
and Fosphenytoin in here.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.000
Tell the OR we're coming.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.002
We got to get
the bullet out now.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.265
All right, let's get him open

24:01.309 --> 24:03.354
and find that bullet.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.668
Dr. Griffith,

24:12.712 --> 24:13.800
will you do the honors?

24:14.583 --> 24:15.802
Spreaders.

24:20.154 --> 24:23.200
There you go,
like riding a bicycle.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.336
Let's do this.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.817
More light.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.258
Bullet's gone.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.262
It's migrated into
the circulatory system.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.656
Well, we have to find it fast.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.923
Looks like the rupture
was self-contained.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.620
I'm gonna fix the hole

24:51.664 --> 24:53.970
in the aortic arch while
Dr. Griffith finds that bullet.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.232
Do you think you can do it

24:55.276 --> 24:56.277
without going on pump?

24:56.320 --> 24:57.887
I'm gonna try. Side clamp.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.063
Tell me you can see it.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.761
Descending aorta's clean.

25:02.631 --> 25:03.632
What about the arms?

25:05.025 --> 25:06.505
Diminished pulse
in the left arm.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.596
Gotcha.

25:10.639 --> 25:12.423
It's lodged in the left
subclavian artery.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.034
- Very bad.
- Not good.

25:14.077 --> 25:15.644
Scalpel.

25:22.651 --> 25:25.088
Can't see to get
- primary control.
- There.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.395
Thank you.

25:27.438 --> 25:28.744
Sponge forceps.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.312
BP is dropping.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.487
I need a...

25:32.531 --> 25:34.228
- Potts scissors.
- Thank you.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.273
Increase the patient's... Norepinephrine drip.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.014
Suction.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.540
I'm running out of time.
This is a needle in a haystack.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.890
You can do this.
There's still time.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.022
Got it.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.288
Let's get him closed up.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.250
After reflecting

25:56.293 --> 25:58.600
upon the tremendous value

25:58.644 --> 26:00.602
each of you brings
to Lakeshore,

26:00.646 --> 26:03.257
the hospital has agreed

26:03.300 --> 26:05.476
to raise all your profit splits

26:05.520 --> 26:08.523
- to 40%, matching Dr. Glass's.
- Thank you.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.133
Effective immediately.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.308
I thank you all

26:11.352 --> 26:12.919
for bringing this
to my attention.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.581
That must've cost
a pretty penny.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.148
As do your tummy tucks,
Dr. Glass.

26:25.192 --> 26:28.021
The post-op complications
of which have been deemed

26:28.064 --> 26:31.372
too risky to allow
outside a hospital setting.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.896
You can't force me
to stop doing these procedures

26:33.940 --> 26:35.115
at my centers.

26:35.158 --> 26:36.638
Yes, we can.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.076
So, you're gonna use
my tummy tucks

26:40.120 --> 26:41.469
to pay for
everyone else's raise?

26:41.512 --> 26:42.688
Mm-hmm.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.254
What do I get?

26:44.298 --> 26:46.474
Continued affiliation
with this hospital.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.520
And, of course,
the satisfaction of contributing

26:49.564 --> 26:51.871
to a much fairer
compensation plan.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.264
That'll be all.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.141
It was good to have you
in there, Dad.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.795
As your scrub nurse?

27:02.838 --> 27:04.100
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.713
Forget it.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.418
What is wrong with you?

27:17.461 --> 27:19.333
Aren't you happy you just got
back into surgery?

27:19.376 --> 27:20.769
I was, actually.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.338
And then I got back out here.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.819
Can you be grateful
for one second?

27:26.862 --> 27:28.777
I know things have changed.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.431
Nothing changed.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.086
Not for me.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.348
I blinked.

27:34.391 --> 27:35.436
We talked about this.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.307
I blinked and everything else

27:37.351 --> 27:38.613
had changed.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.878
There was a scar on my chest,
and everything was...

27:42.922 --> 27:44.706
was-was gone.

27:45.968 --> 27:49.319
My job, my office, my...

27:49.363 --> 27:52.540
standing in the hospital
that I put on the map.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.022
Even you.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.850
All gone.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.552
I woke up to discover...

28:04.595 --> 28:08.774
just how easily
I can be replaced.

28:11.994 --> 28:14.605
So, I got another case
for you, Doctor.

28:14.649 --> 28:15.998
Female in her 30s.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.479
Her boss took an, um...

28:18.522 --> 28:20.611
unexpected leave of absence.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.745
His department is not
doing so great,

28:23.789 --> 28:25.529
and they want her to fill in,

28:25.573 --> 28:27.183
which may seem like
a good solution.

28:27.227 --> 28:29.751
You know, she knows
the hospital, knows the drill.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.666
She...

28:31.710 --> 28:33.668
she knows the job.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.673
Problem is,
she doesn't want to do it.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.070
Don't make me do this.

28:45.158 --> 28:46.812
You can't just
leave me here, you know.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.639
You have responsibilities.

28:48.683 --> 28:52.165
Your department needs you,
and your daughter needs you.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.473
I'll look out for everything
for now, okay?

28:56.517 --> 28:58.824
But you...

28:58.867 --> 29:00.826
you have to wake up.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.568
Do you hear me?

29:07.223 --> 29:09.095
Please wake up.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.751
Okay.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.101
I'll wait.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.850
Hey.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.982
Good thinking
using Rhonda's profits

29:27.026 --> 29:29.463
to even out the pay gap.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.465
I'm sorry it happened
in the first place.

29:31.508 --> 29:34.685
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you
about Rhonda.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.775
We can't let her drive
a wedge into this family.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.865
Well, I think the wedge is
already there.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.214
Whose fault is that?

29:42.302 --> 29:44.695
I'm tired of this fight, Dad.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.393
You had a successful surgery
today, Griff.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.047
I successfully held
a retractor.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.831
I have the paperwork
to prove it. Signature, please.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.311
By your good grace,

29:51.354 --> 29:52.878
I might get to be a doctor
again someday.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.880
I advanced your proctorship
ahead of schedule.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.795
I let you assist on a surgery,

29:56.838 --> 29:58.753
because I want you to succeed,
Dad.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.537
- Sure.
- I always have.

30:00.581 --> 30:01.843
Pens are in the right drawer,

30:01.887 --> 30:03.323
unless you jumped
to change that, too.

30:03.366 --> 30:04.715
That is not how it happened.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.935
Really?
How did it happen? Hmm?

30:06.979 --> 30:08.328
Exactly-- I'm just curious.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.852
H-How long could you
bear to wait

30:10.896 --> 30:13.376
before you stepped
into my shoes?

30:13.420 --> 30:14.769
Was it a month?
Was it a week?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.205
Enough, Griff.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.642
I didn't want to have
to show you this,

30:18.686 --> 30:20.253
but here.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.175
My DNR.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.829
Hmm.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.439
You had it all this time?

30:32.482 --> 30:35.703
You said,
"Don't let me die."

30:35.746 --> 30:38.401
And if I'd handed that over,
they wouldn't have revived you.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.882
So I lied, to everyone,
including Mom.

30:40.926 --> 30:41.970
I violated the oath

30:42.014 --> 30:43.754
that we both took!

30:43.798 --> 30:45.669
A daughter is not supposed
to have to prove

30:45.713 --> 30:47.193
that she loves her father.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.151
But there you go, Dad,
there's your proof.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.153
How long did I wait?

30:51.197 --> 30:53.503
I would've waited forever.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.865
Get me a crash cart!

31:06.908 --> 31:08.475
Sorry. Where is the ICU?

31:08.518 --> 31:09.693
Up those stairs.

31:11.173 --> 31:12.566
I need one gram of calcium

31:12.609 --> 31:14.350
and another gram of epi.

31:22.663 --> 31:24.230
One more.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.276
Clear.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.414
Come on.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.637
Come on. Come on.

31:44.424 --> 31:45.947
No.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.557
Dad!

31:59.134 --> 32:00.744
Sam.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.138
Call it.

32:04.705 --> 32:07.229
Time of death, 17:45.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.500
You ready?

32:17.544 --> 32:19.067
Ready.

32:19.111 --> 32:22.157
To Carl.

32:26.857 --> 32:29.034
This part never gets
any easier.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.165
Mm-mm.

32:30.209 --> 32:31.993
Today was harder than usual.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.648
I just want to call Tim, but...

32:34.691 --> 32:35.997
You haven't talked to him yet?

32:36.041 --> 32:38.217
I haven't figured out
what to say.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.915
You got the booze?

32:40.959 --> 32:43.396
I, um...

32:43.439 --> 32:45.833
I thought we could try
something new.

32:47.226 --> 32:50.359
Better for our livers,
worse for our teeth.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.232
Thank you.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.060
You're welcome.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.630
So...

33:00.674 --> 33:02.328
friends?

33:02.371 --> 33:04.112
Friends.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.818
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.211
Where weren't you at the lake?

33:23.218 --> 33:24.524
Dr. Trulie?

33:24.567 --> 33:26.308
Are you okay?

33:26.352 --> 33:28.093
Yeah. Um...

33:28.136 --> 33:30.530
Sam is waiting, uh,
for an update,

33:30.573 --> 33:33.185
and I have to tell her
that Griff is stable.

33:33.228 --> 33:36.405
Though we are monitoring
the hemorrhaging,

33:36.449 --> 33:39.539
and, um, his pressure is, uh...

33:39.582 --> 33:40.627
Take a breath.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.150
- Hey. Just breathe.
- No.

33:42.194 --> 33:45.240
It's my job,
and I have to do it.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.590
Look at me. Look at me.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.071
Deep breath in.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.338
Hold it.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.775
There you go.

33:58.819 --> 34:01.778
Now let it out, slowly.

34:07.436 --> 34:09.395
I will make you a deal.

34:09.438 --> 34:12.267
I will update Sam and Vivian
right now.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.575
Thank you.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.098
If...

34:17.142 --> 34:21.015
you come see me in my office
tomorrow after work.

34:21.972 --> 34:23.844
Okay?

34:26.194 --> 34:28.588
O-Okay.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.809
Why didn't you tell Sam
about you and Griff?

34:35.769 --> 34:37.901
I didn't know what to tell her.

34:39.164 --> 34:42.123
I didn't know what it was,

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
if it would last.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.953
And then?

34:45.996 --> 34:48.782
I didn't want to make things
harder for her.

34:48.825 --> 34:51.045
So you made them harder
for yourself.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.181
Yeah.

34:56.224 --> 34:59.053
This isn't just about
the shooting, Lex.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.925
You carrying a secret,
alone, for months,

35:01.969 --> 35:03.666
it's taken a toll.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.973
And it will continue to,

35:06.016 --> 35:07.975
unless you get
the support and love you need

35:08.018 --> 35:10.064
to be whole.

35:13.763 --> 35:16.679
My sister Mia...

35:16.723 --> 35:19.552
She's been wanting me
to come visit.

35:19.595 --> 35:22.381
I could, um, do that.

35:22.424 --> 35:24.948
Take some time.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.994
Clear my head.

35:27.037 --> 35:29.431
That sounds like
a really healthy choice.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.172
Yeah.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.399
Hey.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.052
I was hoping we could talk.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.098
Yeah. Me, too.
It's about my dad.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.447
They, um,

35:45.491 --> 35:47.362
they asked me to be chief.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.191
They did?

35:50.235 --> 35:52.715
I mean, interim chief, but...

35:52.759 --> 35:54.108
That's great.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.111
It's an honor.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.678
I just...

35:58.721 --> 36:00.245
I just finished my fellowship.

36:00.288 --> 36:02.334
I don't know the first thing
about being chief.

36:02.377 --> 36:03.813
So you'll learn.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.206
They wouldn't have asked you

36:05.250 --> 36:06.816
if they didn't think
you were up to it.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.210
I think I could be up to it,
if you're with me.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.865
- With you?
- If this door

36:11.908 --> 36:13.823
is gonna open for me,
it can open for both of us.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.956
We could do this
together, and...

36:15.999 --> 36:18.785
Sorry, do you
need to get that?

36:19.786 --> 36:23.311
No. It's just my sister.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.922
But I am with you.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.141
Really?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.404
Of course, Chief.

36:35.541 --> 36:39.240
We keep talking about getting
our friendship back to normal,

36:39.284 --> 36:42.461
but normal was a
problem for me, Sam.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.158
What do you mean?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.986
I wasn't just

36:46.029 --> 36:48.728
your subordinate at work. I
was your subordinate in life.

36:49.772 --> 36:52.297
The more you advanced
at the job,

36:52.340 --> 36:55.343
the more my needs
came second to yours.

36:55.387 --> 36:58.172
That's not how I saw
our friendship.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.218
Maybe not, but it's how it was.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.220
You don't even know

37:02.263 --> 37:04.004
what I was going through
a lot of the time

37:04.047 --> 37:06.049
because I didn't tell you.

37:06.093 --> 37:08.226
I...You had a lot
on your plate,

37:08.269 --> 37:10.532
and I wanted to be there
for you.

37:10.576 --> 37:13.187
I want to be there
for you, too. I...

37:13.231 --> 37:17.278
No job should ever get
in the way of that, Lex. I...Sam,

37:17.322 --> 37:21.108
I cannot put myself second
to you anymore.

37:23.110 --> 37:26.418
Okay?
I need to do things differently.

37:26.461 --> 37:31.161
Whatever you need, I support.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.294
You should never
come second,

37:33.338 --> 37:35.949
especially in our friendship.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.476
I really hope you mean that.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.843
First surgery together,
and we lost the patient.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.715
Not a good sign.

38:02.758 --> 38:05.370
Well, his odds were
slim to start with.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.417
As were mine.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.941
That patient could've
easily been me.

38:13.465 --> 38:15.641
I made it thanks to you.

38:15.684 --> 38:17.207
You had a lot
of good doctors.

38:17.251 --> 38:20.820
Well, you gave me a
second chance, and I...

38:22.387 --> 38:24.345
I would like to use it.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.261
What does that mean?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.916
There's a reason I
want this job back.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.484
And it has to be this
job, this department,

38:32.527 --> 38:34.573
- this hospital.
- Because you built it.

38:34.616 --> 38:37.271
No. I built it.
It's bricks and mortar,

38:37.315 --> 38:39.142
bedsheets that
could go anywhere.

38:39.186 --> 38:43.103
So what? Because it's
the natural order of things?

38:44.147 --> 38:46.802
Because it's where you are.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.331
- You've never said that before.
- I want to be chief,

38:53.374 --> 38:57.422
but I also want to be
your father.

38:57.465 --> 39:01.556
I want to start over,
do things differently.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.689
From the day I woke up.

39:03.732 --> 39:06.344
You have a time machine
I don't know about?

39:08.215 --> 39:09.738
Okay.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.741
Go with me.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.830
- Wow.
- What are you doing?

39:14.874 --> 39:16.397
Waking up from a coma.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.880
Oh, Lord, it's a miracle.

39:20.923 --> 39:23.970
Where am I? What day is it?
- Who won the Super Bowl?
- Dad.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.798
How are you?

39:26.842 --> 39:29.149
That's what I
should have asked.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.586
How are you doing?

39:32.979 --> 39:34.633
Instead, I asked about work.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.374
- Maybe work's all we have.
- No,

39:36.417 --> 39:38.245
Sam.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.595
I'm your father.

39:40.639 --> 39:43.946
What do we have in common
- besides medicine?
- Why don't we try

39:43.990 --> 39:46.601
and find out. Over breakfast.

39:46.645 --> 39:47.994
Breakfast?

39:48.037 --> 39:49.561
Do you eat breakfast?

39:49.604 --> 39:51.911
- Yes.
- See? There you go.

39:51.954 --> 39:54.174
Something we have in common
already.

39:56.872 --> 39:59.440
The day your whole life changes

39:59.484 --> 40:02.269
<i>starts like any other day.</i>

40:02.312 --> 40:03.792
<i>You wake up,</i>

40:03.836 --> 40:06.534
<i>and life</i> <i>
is just how you left it.</i>

40:09.058 --> 40:11.060
Hey. Just hear me out.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.888
There's nothing to say, Joey.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.325
You're right.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.893
There's nothing to say.

40:17.937 --> 40:21.680
Or, at least, I can't say it.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.464
Because I don't have
the words

40:23.508 --> 40:25.814
to describe
what you mean to me.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.904
But today,
I saw a woman lose her husband,

40:28.948 --> 40:31.733
and it made me think
about losing you.

40:31.777 --> 40:34.388
Or, at least, I tried to,
but I couldn't

40:34.432 --> 40:35.737
because I don't know

40:35.781 --> 40:38.087
what life would be like
without you,

40:38.131 --> 40:41.439
and I don't want to find out.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.310
Ever.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.443
So...

40:45.486 --> 40:48.054
Here's something better
than words.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.926
And that's when it happens. What?

40:50.970 --> 40:52.362
Marry me.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.931
Please.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.065
Yes.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.546
Yeah.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.025
Just kiss me, you idiot.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.419
In an instant,

41:05.463 --> 41:07.726
<i>the life you knew is gone.</i>

41:07.769 --> 41:09.379
"But maybe that's okay,

41:09.423 --> 41:13.645
"because maybe it's time
to start something new.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.647
Something better."Mm.

41:15.690 --> 41:18.388
Kind of making this all
about you, aren't you?

41:18.432 --> 41:20.478
Exactly.
