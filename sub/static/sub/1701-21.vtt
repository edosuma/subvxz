WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:04.461
Stocks and bonds are moving higher...

00:04.629 --> 00:07.131
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

00:07.298 --> 00:11.260
Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.430
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.349
But when it does, it's exciting.

00:17.517 --> 00:21.061
Hmm, okay, honey,
you really need a job.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.357
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

00:25.525 --> 00:29.236
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.699
On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

00:34.284 --> 00:37.661
No, you just said "dad."
And everywhere I go today...

00:37.829 --> 00:40.456
...I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.876
Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.337
Which is my father's last name.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.256
Ah.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.216
And they were serving franks...

00:51.384 --> 00:53.927
...which is his first name,
minus the "s" at the end.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.679
- Yes.
- All right.

00:55.847 --> 00:59.683
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.478
His Indian name?

01:02.687 --> 01:07.149
No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

01:07.859 --> 01:11.361
...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.864
- Very freaky.
- Eerie.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.783
Who wants the last hamburger?

01:15.950 --> 01:18.118
That's it.
Now I have to go see him, ha, ha.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.411
Why?

01:19.579 --> 01:22.831
Hamburger? McDonald's?

01:22.999 --> 01:25.918
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.836
Ah.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.426
Man, I am so beat.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.178
Oh, yeah.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.639
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.391
Yeah, all right.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.814
- Hey, you're in our seats.
- Oh, sorry, we didn't know.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.649
Hey, we were sitting there.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.986
Okay. There is one more way to say it.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.863
- Who knows it? Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

02:37.365 --> 02:42.077
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- Actually, I was going for colorful.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.996
- What's with this guy?
- What's with you?

02:44.205 --> 02:46.748
Uh, nothing. Nothing's with him.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.375
Enjoy your coffee.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.009
What just happened?

02:58.386 --> 03:01.847
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.100
My joke is that I took your hat.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.644
That is funny.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.646
Can I have it back?

03:09.856 --> 03:10.981
No.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.151
- No?
- No.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.778
Okay. Okay.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.866
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.952
Kudos on that hat joke. Ha, ha.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.999
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.460
Why should we?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.879
Because it's a special hat.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.591
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.134
So he got the hat...

03:39.302 --> 03:41.470
...to cheer himself up, you know?

03:41.638 --> 03:45.557
- Now, Chandler...
- Stop talking. Stop talking now.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.645
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

03:49.812 --> 03:50.896
You got a problem?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.774
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.487
How'd the interview go?

03:58.696 --> 03:59.988
It bit.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.325
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

04:03.493 --> 04:07.079
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.581
I was a sous-chef
at CafÃ© des Artistes.

04:09.749 --> 04:14.294
How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.797
- Don't do it.
- How can I not do it?

04:16.964 --> 04:18.798
I have $127 in the bank.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.010
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.512
I don't want a beer.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.138
Who said it was for you?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.771
Hi.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.148
What's the matter?

04:35.316 --> 04:38.527
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.445
- No.
- You're kidding.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.073
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.200
Actual bullies.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.203
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.622
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.249
Oh...

04:52.417 --> 04:55.043
Oh, no, wait a minute. I have no one.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.466
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

05:01.634 --> 05:05.846
Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.891
- Hey. I went up!
- What?

05:10.059 --> 05:13.437
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

05:13.604 --> 05:17.858
Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $127 in myself yesterday...

05:18.026 --> 05:21.737
...that I'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.823
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.035
- Do what?
- Put all my money in me.

05:28.202 --> 05:31.079
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.207
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.251
Yes, Manhattan.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.712
Telephone number to the stock...

05:39.297 --> 05:41.131
...selling store.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.436
See? Didn't I tell you these pillows
would be a good idea?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.897
Oh, God.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.899
Here we go.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.986
For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, birth father!"

06:03.654 --> 06:05.822
- We love you. We're here for you.
- Good luck.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.074
Thanks.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.621
Hey, Rach, you, uh,
want some sandwich?

06:12.789 --> 06:15.123
Oh, what is in that?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.501
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.587
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.508
Hey, hey... No, oh, oh, oh.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.302
- Run, Phoebe, run.
- No, no, doggy, please!

06:27.470 --> 06:31.098
I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

06:31.265 --> 06:33.433
- You got a bone?
- Are you kidding?

06:33.601 --> 06:35.727
Look, kibbles! Bits, oh!

06:37.188 --> 06:39.940
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

06:44.445 --> 06:45.737
Ooh.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.449
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.494
Why don't you take his trampoline?

06:53.162 --> 06:54.830
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.374
Hey. Hey. Hey, no!

06:57.542 --> 07:00.961
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich! Aah!

07:01.129 --> 07:04.631
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

07:05.174 --> 07:08.927
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.595
What does that tell you?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.141
- If he's not gonna eat it, I will.
- Are you crazy?

07:14.684 --> 07:18.103
Pheebs, he's just a little dog. Aah!

07:24.360 --> 07:25.902
- Hey.
- What?

07:26.070 --> 07:28.530
Do you have to be
a Century 21 real-estate agent...

07:28.698 --> 07:31.741
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

07:33.786 --> 07:36.580
Do you say this stuff to girls?

07:39.167 --> 07:42.335
Hey, isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

07:42.503 --> 07:44.337
And look where they're sitting.

07:47.341 --> 07:51.720
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.181
- Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
- Yeah.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.058
This couch belongs to us.

07:57.226 --> 08:00.770
I'll tell you what, you call the couch...

08:00.938 --> 08:03.273
...and then we'll call the couch...

08:04.942 --> 08:06.526
...and we'll see who it comes to.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.865
You know what I keep wondering?
Why you two are still sitting here.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.825
All right, that's it.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.036
I have had enough of this, all right?

08:16.537 --> 08:17.621
Gunther.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.999
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.170
Fellas, these guys were here first.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.214
- Oh, sorry, didn't realize.
- Ahem.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.715
There you go.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.176
Thank you, Gunther.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.804
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.518
He told on us?

08:39.769 --> 08:40.936
You told on us?

08:41.102 --> 08:44.397
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.401
- Don't play with his thing.
- I know.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.155
All right.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.866
Let's take this outside.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.746
"Let's take this outside"?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.501
Who talks like that?

09:04.710 --> 09:09.130
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.675
- You had to ask.
- Yeah.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.055
Okay, okay, look. See...

09:17.223 --> 09:21.351
...the thing is,
we're not gonna fight you guys.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.687
Here's the deal.

09:23.854 --> 09:28.858
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.158
I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.584
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.544
Yeah, I don't know.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.630
What's the matter?

09:50.798 --> 09:53.300
I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.970
Like the beast at the threshold.

09:58.431 --> 10:03.351
It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.479
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.106
Despite what she says.

10:09.734 --> 10:15.864
And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.199
I don't know. This is my real father...

10:18.367 --> 10:21.202
...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.246
I completely understand.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.998
Yeah, whatever you need.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.293
Hey, you want to go home?

10:28.502 --> 10:30.795
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.067
What was that?

10:54.528 --> 10:59.240
Uh, I'm guessing
the threshold's clear now.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.497
I want to buy five shares of SGJ. Now.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.208
Come on, time is money, my friend!

11:08.376 --> 11:11.169
Thank you! Whoo!

11:11.337 --> 11:13.296
"Time is money, my friend"?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.173
You missed
"Takes money to make money"...

11:15.383 --> 11:20.095
...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt."

11:20.304 --> 11:23.848
I made $17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

11:24.058 --> 11:27.644
I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.563
How did you make $17?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.066
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

11:33.234 --> 11:36.653
...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.738
How come those?

11:38.906 --> 11:43.702
Well, CHP because I used to have
a crush on Erik Estrada.

11:44.662 --> 11:48.748
And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy."

11:48.958 --> 11:51.084
Ahem, what happened to MEG?

11:51.293 --> 11:53.712
MEG was good for me,
but I dumped her.

11:53.879 --> 11:57.340
My motto is, "Get out before they go down."

11:58.426 --> 12:01.052
That is so not my motto.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.642
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.060
- Oh, hey, how's the dog?
- Yeah.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.939
Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.609
He said the little fella's gonna be okay,
and I can get him tomorrow.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.403
- Good.
- Oh, thank God.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.822
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.701
And he said that only once in a blue moon
does a dog's ear grow back.

12:24.869 --> 12:29.038
So still hoping.

12:30.833 --> 12:35.628
Now are you gonna call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

12:35.838 --> 12:39.591
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.260
What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.096
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

12:46.056 --> 12:48.725
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.018
Okay.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.189
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.107
Don't...

12:58.110 --> 12:59.360
...be too long with the phone.

13:00.529 --> 13:04.324
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

13:06.869 --> 13:07.952
It's a woman.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.579
So talk to her.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.501
Uh, hello, Mrs. Buffay.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.671
I know where your dog is.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.717
I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

13:22.885 --> 13:25.386
...within 24 hours.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.764
Uh, goodbye.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.606
- Why the voice?
- Hard to say.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.611
Your cappuccino, sir.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.446
Thank you.

13:46.450 --> 13:50.453
- This is better than the coffeehouse.
- Absolutely.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.381
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

14:01.549 --> 14:04.092
The package says to keep it moving.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.803
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.102
This is ridiculous.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.021
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

14:17.189 --> 14:21.693
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.320
No problem. Joey's there, hmm?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.407
- Okay.
- No.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.284
- No?
- No.

14:29.451 --> 14:34.414
I don't want to have to have Joey with me
every time I want decent coffee.

14:34.623 --> 14:38.084
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k."

14:38.252 --> 14:41.462
I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.090
All right, hang on a second there, Custer.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.136
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.345
Yeah, sure.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.682
- By someone besides Monica?
- No.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.767
So what?

14:54.935 --> 14:58.438
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.900
Like a rite of passage or something.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.236
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

15:06.238 --> 15:09.115
Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.202
- I need $100.
- What?

15:13.370 --> 15:15.622
Hi. Welcome home.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.498
- I need $100.
- For what?

15:17.708 --> 15:20.168
- To get back in the game.
- When did you get out?

15:20.336 --> 15:23.338
- I lost it all, I lost it.
- Oh, no.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.632
I've come to terms with it,
you have to too.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.510
Okay.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.097
Look, uh, Mon, I'm really sorry.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.974
Where are we on the $100?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.392
I don't have it.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.394
But I need it!

15:39.063 --> 15:41.356
Otherwise, I'll have to take that diner job.

15:41.523 --> 15:46.569
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.200
I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.037
Nobody does, honey.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.499
Hi.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.000
Noodle!

16:01.168 --> 16:05.630
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.048
It was an accident.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.468
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.470
She's a vegetarian.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.014
Are these stitches?

16:15.224 --> 16:18.810
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him, ha, ha.

16:19.019 --> 16:22.438
If it's raining, you can't
let him look up too long...

16:22.606 --> 16:24.816
...because that cone
will fill up fast.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.528
Well, uh, thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.823
- Is Frank home?
- How do you know Frank?

16:32.032 --> 16:35.034
Just from a long time ago. Is he here?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.371
Yeah. Frank.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.623
Yeah.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.333
What?

16:42.543 --> 16:45.420
Oh, okay, um, I mean Frank Senior.

16:45.629 --> 16:46.879
He went out for groceries.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.840
Will he be back soon?

16:49.049 --> 16:52.719
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.055
I'm gonna go.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.725
I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.476
I'm sorry.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.853
Hey, lady!

17:02.021 --> 17:04.230
Hey, wait up!

17:08.569 --> 17:12.113
- How do you know my dad?
- Um, well, I don't really.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.366
Just genetically.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.952
He's kind of my dad too.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.454
Heavy.

17:19.663 --> 17:20.954
Yeah.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.626
So, um, did he ever
talk about me? Phoebe?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.378
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.089
Oh.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.216
Except stilts.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.720
- Stilts?
- Yeah, he loved stilts.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.891
One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

17:40.100 --> 17:42.894
...and, uh, all of a sudden
I look over...

17:43.062 --> 17:45.897
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.777
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

17:50.944 --> 17:53.821
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.950
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.453
I don't know what to do with that.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.663
- Me neither, ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.795
- So are you, like, my big sister?
- Yeah.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.923
This is huge.
You can buy me beer, ha, ha.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.009
- I'm not gonna.
- Oh.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.888
But you know what's cool?
If you had a friend named Pete, I could say:

18:19.056 --> 18:21.724
"I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother."

18:22.518 --> 18:25.478
- I got a friend named Mark.
- That'll work too.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.230
Cool. All right.

18:27.481 --> 18:32.318
So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.195
We could talk or something.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.405
- Yeah, that'd be okay.
- All right.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.657
I'm in the book.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.368
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay, all right.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.623
So, um, stilts, huh?

18:45.833 --> 18:50.294
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.296
Okay.

18:55.050 --> 18:59.387
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.975
- How long does coffee take?
- Would you come on? Come on!

19:06.061 --> 19:07.562
Thank you.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.033
- There we go.
- I think we proved our point.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.830
- You burn your mouth?
- Cannot feel my tongue.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.170
Bullies! Big bullies!

19:32.379 --> 19:35.882
Oh, look who's here. It's the weenies.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.344
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

19:40.554 --> 19:41.929
That's why we're here.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.682
Yes, we're standing our ground.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.851
Apparently.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.769
- Let's do this already.
- Whoa, whoa.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.062
You got a weapon?

19:50.939 --> 19:53.065
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.443
All right, let's do this.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.824
Question: If I don't care about my watch,
can I use it as a weapon?

20:01.992 --> 20:04.243
- What do you mean?
- It's sharp, it's metal.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.246
I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.916
No, you can't use your watch.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.292
Okay.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.878
- Or your keys.
- Okay.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.379
Here's what we'll do.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.133
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.551
- All right?
- All right.

20:22.512 --> 20:25.223
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

20:25.432 --> 20:28.893
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

20:29.102 --> 20:30.978
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

20:31.188 --> 20:34.440
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.735
Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

20:37.903 --> 20:41.948
...and, uh, this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.825
Okay, nothing from the neck up.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.577
All right.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.829
Or the waist down.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.499
- Dana's ovulating.
- Oh, really? You guys trying again?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.167
Yeah.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.629
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

20:56.838 --> 20:58.506
- Come on!
- Hey, hey, whoa!

20:58.674 --> 21:01.759
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

21:01.969 --> 21:03.427
- Huh!
- Hey, hey.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.971
Those guys are taking our stuff!

21:05.180 --> 21:06.389
Hey, hey!

21:10.477 --> 21:12.812
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.898
- You guys kicked butt!
- Us? What about you guys?

21:16.066 --> 21:19.026
You really, bing, gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.570
- He was a big guy.
- Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

21:21.738 --> 21:24.198
I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.534
Oh, don't do that to yourself.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.620
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

21:32.749 --> 21:36.294
So listen, guys, are we, uh?

21:36.878 --> 21:38.170
Are we okay here?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.465
- We're okay.
- Ha, ha, all right.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.884
Okay, so can I have my hat back?

21:45.595 --> 21:47.013
No.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.265
Huh.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.736
Oh, my God. Look at her.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.114
Hi, Monica!

22:05.282 --> 22:07.033
Ha-ha-ha, how's it going?

22:07.242 --> 22:08.659
Hey, nice boobs.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.454
Guys, guys. Check this out.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.090
Young man

22:25.635 --> 22:29.138
I said, young man
Pick yourself off the ground

22:29.306 --> 22:30.765
I said, young man

22:30.932 --> 22:32.558
Excellent.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.019
To be unhappy

22:37.189 --> 22:45.529
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
