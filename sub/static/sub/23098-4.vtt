00:05.200 --> 00:07.960
Our world is not always the same.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.440
Hidden from our view lies
a different world.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.600
Creatures utterly unlike us...

00:16.720 --> 00:18.080
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

00:18.800 --> 00:19.720
..almost alien.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.480
Yet they are more numerous
than any other group on the planet.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.160
Welcome to the fascinating
world of the arthropods -

00:35.280 --> 00:39.680
spiders, scorpions and insects.

00:40.300 --> 00:44.300
Today we have new camera
techniques that will allow us

00:44.420 --> 00:48.820
to reveal in greater detail than
ever before their lives.

00:49.408 --> 00:53.448
The way they fight and feed
and reproduce.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.080
This series uses specially developed
3D camera technology to study

00:58.200 --> 01:02.240
the micro world in extraordinary
detail, both on location

01:02.360 --> 01:05.400
and in specially constructed
environments.

01:06.220 --> 01:09.220
We'll witness their births,
the challenges they face,

01:09.340 --> 01:12.278
and the moments when their lives
hang in the balance.

01:13.620 --> 01:17.020
And that may help us
understand how it is that today

01:17.608 --> 01:23.248
over 80% of all animal species
on this planet, are arthropods.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.240
In this series we'll see the way
they have evolved,

01:27.860 --> 01:31.980
from the comparative
simplicity of the millipede, to vast

01:32.100 --> 01:35.860
colonies that contain hundreds,
even millions of individuals.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.060
We'll witness the most
extraordinary transformations

01:41.180 --> 01:42.540
in the animal kingdom...

01:44.020 --> 01:46.620
We'll meet ants that farm...

01:46.974 --> 01:49.654
Spiders that can cast their webs.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.320
And the bug that wears the bodies
of its victims as a disguise.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.125
Welcome to a strange
and dangerous world.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.080
Every species of animal must
reproduce.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.080
If it didn't it would go extinct.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.120
Arthropods have developed many
ways of doing so.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.000
From courtship and mating...

02:41.280 --> 02:43.080
..to egg laying.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.040
The hatching of larvae...

02:47.980 --> 02:50.100
..to caring for the newly-born
young.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.600
And some insects meet
the reproductive challenge

02:59.720 --> 03:02.120
by splitting their life cycle
in two.

03:03.740 --> 03:06.100
And all in order to produce
offspring

03:06.220 --> 03:09.140
and ensure they get the best
possible start in life.

03:13.780 --> 03:14.740
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

03:15.460 --> 03:18.260
The arthropods' success in doing
so has lead them

03:18.380 --> 03:22.660
to becoming one of the most abundant
forms of animals on this planet.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.140
In the woodlands of Madagascar
and parts of Southern Africa lives

03:29.260 --> 03:34.380
a spider that has to rely on stealth
in order to mate and father young.

03:36.280 --> 03:40.040
This is the male
golden orb web spider.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.920
He hatched two months ago
and is now looking for a mate.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.600
He's found a female's web
and he's lurking at its edge.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.100
This is the female.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.540
As spiders go, she's huge.

03:57.960 --> 04:03.785
Her body alone is as long as your
thumb and her legs span some 15cm.

04:08.820 --> 04:11.780
She's about 20 times
the size of the male.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.519
Not only that,
she's a deadly predator...

04:21.640 --> 04:23.599
..with a voracious appetite.

04:26.349 --> 04:30.337
And all this makes mating a risky
business for the male.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.460
The start of their courtship is
triggered by the insect

04:42.580 --> 04:44.628
the female has already captured.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.680
She is distracted by it,
so he seizes his opportunity.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.280
He cautiously begins an approach...

05:24.860 --> 05:28.580
He climbs very tentatively
onto her abdomen.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.960
Now he's in position,
he deposits his sperm.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.800
Success!

05:47.920 --> 05:51.920
His alertness has saved him from
becoming the female's next meal.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.400
He will only mate
once in his short life

05:58.520 --> 06:01.360
and this is his reward.

06:01.480 --> 06:06.120
He is father to the 400 or
so eggs in this egg sac.

06:12.401 --> 06:15.760
A few weeks later the young
emerge from it.

06:20.341 --> 06:23.640
The spiderlings are each no
bigger than a pinhead.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.880
To begin with,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.920
they stay close to the egg
sac from which they emerged.

06:35.460 --> 06:39.620
They moult and then, after 30 days,
they start to disperse.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.400
Golden orb web spiders
live for only a year.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.280
Mating is the culmination
of their lives.

07:03.320 --> 07:08.240
For some creatures though,
time is simply too short for mating,

07:08.860 --> 07:12.100
so the females reproduce
without a male.

07:13.500 --> 07:18.460
Spring is the season
when most arthropod eggs hatch.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.260
But in colder climates,
spring arrives late

07:21.580 --> 07:23.140
and the summer is short,

07:23.260 --> 07:24.740
leaving little time to mate

07:24.960 --> 07:28.320
and for the young to grow strong
enough to survive the coming winter.

07:32.900 --> 07:37.260
Megabunus, a species of harvestmen,
has a way of dealing with that.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.980
The female lives in Alpine forests

07:43.100 --> 07:46.420
and spends the freezing winter
sheltered in the leaf litter.

07:47.880 --> 07:52.000
She emerges in spring
and starts to hunt.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.320
Her long legs help her to
clamber over the moss.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.820
In fact,
her legs are so long, that she

07:59.940 --> 08:03.540
has breathing holes in them
to supply them directly with oxygen.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.460
But she must reproduce
if the species is to survive.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.440
So she does so without mating.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.720
She lays unfertilised eggs which
hatch into exact genetic

08:28.840 --> 08:30.920
copies of herself -

08:31.540 --> 08:33.220
clones.

08:35.659 --> 08:39.900
She adapted her reproduction
to the harsh climate and

08:40.020 --> 08:45.020
so sacrificed the genetic variation
that could've come with sex.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.700
But other plant-eaters in gentler
climates use the same

08:51.820 --> 08:56.620
technique to take advantage of the
glut of food that comes with spring.

09:00.420 --> 09:03.700
Aphids also clone their offspring,
and what is more,

09:03.820 --> 09:06.620
a female produces her young alive.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.960
And she can do
so ten times a day or more.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.360
Not only that, each of her offspring
will start producing

09:19.480 --> 09:21.578
young of their own within days.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.360
If the descendants of a single
female all survived,

09:26.558 --> 09:30.992
they would, by the end of summer,
number 600 billion.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.806
All of them identical clones.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.300
But as the winter
approaches the aphids

09:45.420 --> 09:47.853
change their way of reproducing.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.835
They lay eggs.

09:57.580 --> 10:01.340
Aphids cannot survive
the cold of the winter,

10:01.460 --> 10:05.380
but the eggs are hardy
and will hatch next spring.

10:05.900 --> 10:10.804
And then, once again,
the aphid population will explode.

10:19.980 --> 10:23.660
The million or so species of
arthropod on our planet have matched

10:23.780 --> 10:26.460
the way they reproduce to
suit the particular

10:26.580 --> 10:28.864
environment in which they live.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.420
Most of them lay eggs.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.455
And some do
so in scarcely believable numbers.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.172
Once such lives on a hedgehog.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.460
Ixodes is a tick - a parasite.

11:04.780 --> 11:08.060
The female is so well adapted to
life on a hedgehog that she

11:08.180 --> 11:10.660
rarely lives anywhere else.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.840
She has a limitless supply of food
immediately beside her -

11:15.760 --> 11:17.106
blood.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.880
She stays on the hedgehog
until she's ready to lay her eggs.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.320
Then she lets go,
falls to the ground...

11:31.560 --> 11:35.200
..and starts to deposit her
eggs in the undergrowth.

11:41.040 --> 11:45.040
The eggs make up 50% of her
entire body weight.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.360
She can lay around 1,500 of them

11:51.480 --> 11:55.068
and it takes her up to 20 days
to lay them all.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.700
Producing so many is her
way of ensuring that at least one or

12:03.820 --> 12:07.736
two of her young will
find their own hedgehog host.

12:10.460 --> 12:13.849
For those that do the cycle can
begin again.

12:17.380 --> 12:19.540
By the time Ixodes has
produced them all,

12:19.960 --> 12:25.908
her once plump body is deflated
and she dies.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.880
Some insects, among them
butterflies, have developed

12:38.000 --> 12:42.911
a way of growing that involves
a truly astonishing transformation.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.380
This is a Heliconius butterfly.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.772
And THIS is its offspring -

12:52.909 --> 12:54.360
a caterpillar.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.360
The two look as though they're
completely different creatures,

12:57.480 --> 12:59.480
but of course, they're not.

12:59.600 --> 13:03.520
The butterfly has
divided its life into two halves.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.840
The first half, the caterpillar,

13:06.160 --> 13:11.120
is devoted almost exclusively to
gathering food and growing.

13:11.740 --> 13:14.220
And the second, the adult,

13:14.340 --> 13:17.660
is devoted almost entirely to
reproduction.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.560
Adult butterflies
feed on nectar which they locate

13:39.680 --> 13:44.680
with their antennae,
taste through their feet

13:45.400 --> 13:48.660
and collect with long,
tube-like mouthparts.

13:52.860 --> 13:56.406
This sugar-rich food
fuels their search for a mate.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.800
Once a male and female have found
one another, the male uses special

14:06.920 --> 14:11.760
claspers at the end of his abdomen
to transfer his sperm to her.

14:19.060 --> 14:22.620
Once fertilised,
the female Heliconius lays her

14:22.740 --> 14:25.780
eggs on the leaves of the
passion flower plant.

14:27.877 --> 14:30.757
Her young, the caterpillars,
are fussy eaters

14:31.080 --> 14:34.560
and these leaves are almost
the only ones they will eat.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.660
She lays around 50 eggs
and then her work is done.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.540
About a week later
the caterpillars emerge.

14:56.780 --> 14:59.500
They are little more than
eating machines

14:59.820 --> 15:02.284
and they get down to work
immediately.

15:06.800 --> 15:12.634
Some, over a month or two, can grow
to 40 times their original size.

15:19.060 --> 15:22.900
They have protective spines to
ward off their predators,

15:23.020 --> 15:25.093
but no reproductive organs.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.880
Then, when they've grown enough,
their behaviour changes.

15:41.080 --> 15:45.080
They stop eating and settle
in a suitable resting place.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.807
Then their skins hardens to
form a shell.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.660
This is a chrysalis.

15:56.780 --> 16:00.260
If we could see inside we would
witness one of the most

16:00.380 --> 16:03.300
extraordinary
changes in the animal kingdom...

16:04.500 --> 16:06.863
..metamorphosis.

16:13.361 --> 16:16.521
Some parts of the caterpillar
are transformed

16:17.120 --> 16:19.800
and others disappear completely.

16:21.160 --> 16:25.080
The caterpillar had a massive
gut for processing food,

16:25.500 --> 16:29.420
that shrinks for nectar will be
easier to digest than

16:29.540 --> 16:32.243
the leaves the caterpillar consume.

16:35.740 --> 16:40.060
The mouth parts must change -
the adult needs not munching jaws,

16:40.180 --> 16:41.900
but a tube-like tongue.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.860
And the caterpillar's simple
eyes are also transformed.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.120
Searching for a mate needs better
eyesight than finding leaves.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.640
Antennae sprout form its head.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.720
It will use them to sniff out
the scent of a female or a flower.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.500
And finally, its wings,
their shape and colour will

17:08.619 --> 17:12.980
warn off predators and enable it
to find and select a suitable mate.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.040
An adult Heliconius butterfly
emerges after

17:23.160 --> 17:25.920
eight days of transformation.

17:51.540 --> 17:54.940
Its delicate wings are crumpled
and wet.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.980
It stretches them
by pumping blood along their veins

17:58.600 --> 18:02.360
and then waits for them
to dry before attempting to fly.

18:11.220 --> 18:15.060
From this point on its body will
not grow or change...

18:17.780 --> 18:20.060
It will live for just a month or two

18:20.180 --> 18:23.420
and feed just enough to keep
itself going.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.600
This body is purely for mating.

18:31.420 --> 18:34.940
A male's antennae can detect
females' scent from more than

18:35.060 --> 18:36.780
a kilometre away.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.720
And he's off to find a female.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.800
Success for this butterfly is
reproduction,

19:18.920 --> 19:21.600
as it is for all species.

19:21.820 --> 19:26.500
And that need has shaped the bodies,
the behaviour,

19:26.620 --> 19:30.540
the entire life cycle of all
arthropods, and produced

19:30.660 --> 19:35.154
the dazzling range of forms that we
see around the world today.

19:39.580 --> 19:42.860
Every generation must
reproduce itself,

19:42.980 --> 19:45.540
if it does not a species
will disappear.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.840
From the cunning,
tiny make golden orb web spider...

19:54.520 --> 19:58.280
..to the amazingly fertile aphids
that clone themselves to make

19:58.400 --> 19:59.680
the most of summer.

20:03.380 --> 20:07.020
And the tick that leaves its
hedgehog host to lay its eggs.

20:09.820 --> 20:13.100
The arthropods have evolved
reproductive strategies

20:13.520 --> 20:16.000
that are surely among the most
fascinating,

20:16.120 --> 20:20.090
almost unbelievable
stories, in the natural world.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.020
In our next programme,

20:29.340 --> 20:32.732
I'll be looking at what happens
after reproduction.

20:37.580 --> 20:42.189
Over 400 million years ago some
early arthropods began to

20:42.300 --> 20:45.900
care for their young
and to live in groups.

20:51.080 --> 20:56.080
And for these too, life was
about more than just staying alive,

20:56.400 --> 20:59.120
it was about giving the next
generation the best

20:59.240 --> 21:01.348
chance of survival.
