01:18.184 --> 01:21.620
A hundred years ago,
all was right with our world.

01:21.754 --> 01:24.723
Prosperity and peace filled our days.

01:24.857 --> 01:26.381
The Four Nations:

01:26.526 --> 01:32.362
Water, Earth, Fire and Air Nomads
lived amongst each other in harmony.

01:32.498 --> 01:37.231
Great respect was afforded to all those
who could bend their natural element.

01:37.370 --> 01:41.363
The Avatar was the only person
born amongst all the nations

01:41.507 --> 01:44.237
who could master all four elements.

01:44.377 --> 01:48.313
He was the only one who could
communicate with the Spirit World.

01:48.448 --> 01:52.976
With the Spirits'guidance,
the Avatar kept balance in the world.

01:53.786 --> 01:57.722
And then, a hundred years ago,
he just disappeared.

02:34.427 --> 02:36.361
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

02:36.496 --> 02:38.464
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

02:38.598 --> 02:42.557
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey!
It Worked better that time.

02:42.702 --> 02:46.160
I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?

02:47.440 --> 02:50.432
Yeah. I guess so.

02:50.776 --> 02:55.042
Just stop doing that stuff around me.
I alWays get Wet.

02:58.618 --> 03:01.644
My brother and I live
in the Southern Water Tribe,

03:01.787 --> 03:06.383
which was once a big city.
Our father is off fighting in The War.

03:06.726 --> 03:09.854
My mother was taken prisoner
and killed when I was young.

03:10.530 --> 03:13.988
In this time of war, food is scarce.

03:14.133 --> 03:16.294
My brother and I often
go hunting for food,

03:16.435 --> 03:20.633
but, unfortunately, my brother
isn't the best hunter in the world.

03:25.311 --> 03:27.472
- Tiger seal.
- Are you sure?

03:51.237 --> 03:52.829
I did everything Dad said to do.

03:52.972 --> 03:55.338
I Watched Which side of the fin tracks
are more indented.

03:55.474 --> 03:56.941
That shoWs Which
direction they're going.

03:57.076 --> 04:00.773
I saW hoW long the drag skids are.
That shoWs you hoW fast they're going.

04:09.155 --> 04:10.782
There's something under there.

04:25.204 --> 04:28.537
It's a cave-in!
Move aWay from the cracks!

04:56.168 --> 05:01.265
Katara, don't go near it.
This is probably some Fire Nation trick.

05:02.074 --> 05:05.066
Just back aWay really sloW.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.244
Katara! Do not hit that sphere!

05:28.467 --> 05:29.957
Uncle, look!

06:10.476 --> 06:11.909
Is he breathing?

06:15.181 --> 06:17.741
Did you see that light
shoot into the sky?

06:18.384 --> 06:19.578
What's your name?

06:20.653 --> 06:24.646
HoW did you get here?
HoW did you get in the ice?

06:25.491 --> 06:27.152
He's exhausted.

06:28.494 --> 06:30.655
We need to get him back to the village.

06:37.737 --> 06:38.726
What is this thing?

06:43.743 --> 06:45.404
It's trying to eat me!

06:53.385 --> 06:55.285
Look. See?

07:06.799 --> 07:08.426
HoW'd you get all the Way out here?

07:09.201 --> 07:10.600
I ran aWay from home.

07:11.137 --> 07:14.732
We got in a storm. We Were forced
under the Water of the ocean.

07:14.874 --> 07:16.603
I see.

07:16.742 --> 07:19.438
It Wasn't very smart. I Was just upset.

07:20.446 --> 07:22.380
- Thanks for saving me.
- Lucky.

07:22.982 --> 07:25.951
I probably should get home.
They'll all be Worried.

07:26.085 --> 07:29.213
- You're not still upset?
- Not as much as I Was.

07:47.072 --> 07:48.198
The Fire Nation is here.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.205
- What?
- And they brought their machines.

07:52.378 --> 07:54.744
Don't come out
till I tell you it's safe.

07:56.549 --> 08:00.508
- Is something Wrong?
- No. Please Wait here.

08:00.653 --> 08:04.145
- Hurry, noW!
- Secure the area!

08:15.968 --> 08:18.061
It can't be coincidence
that We break him out of the ice,

08:18.204 --> 08:21.765
light shoots into the sky and noW the
Fire Nation is here With their machines.

08:33.152 --> 08:35.120
Sokka, don't.

08:44.263 --> 08:46.197
I am Prince Zuko...

08:46.765 --> 08:50.963
...son of Fire Lord Ozai
and heir to the throne!

08:52.705 --> 08:55.265
Bring me all your elderly!

08:55.407 --> 08:57.238
- Papa!
- Move!

08:57.376 --> 08:58.434
Yeah?

09:02.381 --> 09:03.643
Grandma!

09:08.387 --> 09:10.981
Please don't... don't harm him!

09:12.291 --> 09:13.656
Come on!

09:18.330 --> 09:19.991
Katara, don't.

09:20.566 --> 09:23.228
- Form a line!
- Come on!

09:27.506 --> 09:28.700
Here.

09:29.575 --> 09:30.769
Hey.

09:44.423 --> 09:46.118
Grammy!

09:48.594 --> 09:49.925
You're scaring these people.

09:57.803 --> 09:59.862
Who are you? What's your name?!

10:00.005 --> 10:03.031
- I don't need to tell you anything.
- Firebenders!

10:08.180 --> 10:10.045
I'm taking you to my ship.

10:10.549 --> 10:14.383
If you don't come,
I'll burn doWn this village.

10:15.020 --> 10:18.478
I'll go With you.
Don't hurt anyone.

10:33.906 --> 10:36.500
They Were looking for someone old
and they Were looking for someone

10:36.642 --> 10:38.337
With the same markings the boy had.

10:38.477 --> 10:41.742
They dragged Mom aWay
the same Way When We Were babies.

10:41.880 --> 10:45.213
She Wouldn't have Watched us being
taken aWay. She Would have fought.

10:45.351 --> 10:48.878
We found that boy. He's our
responsibility. We should fight.

10:50.089 --> 10:52.785
What Would you do
if they tried to take me aWay?

10:52.925 --> 10:54.415
I'd kill them all.

10:55.894 --> 10:58.522
- Why?
- Because you're my sister.

10:59.198 --> 11:01.860
Because Dad told me
to protect you With my life.

11:03.769 --> 11:08.968
Because I'm your responsibility.
And this boy is our responsibility.

11:12.511 --> 11:16.504
What do you Want us to do, Katara?
HoW are We supposed to save him?

11:16.648 --> 11:19.048
They're on a ship.
We'd need a miracle to catch them.

11:19.184 --> 11:22.176
I knoW you think everything's
going to Work out, but I don't.

11:37.636 --> 11:40.127
His bison creature thing floats.

12:00.926 --> 12:02.052
What do you Want With me?

12:03.495 --> 12:06.828
My nepheW Wants me to perform
a little test on you.

12:09.168 --> 12:12.296
- What kind of test?
- I assure you, it Won't hurt.

12:12.438 --> 12:15.930
I've performed it hundreds of times.
It only takes a feW moments.

12:16.075 --> 12:17.599
And then you're free to go.

12:19.678 --> 12:22.545
Would you mind if I put a feW things
in front of you at the table?

12:23.182 --> 12:25.173
It Will only take a moment.

12:26.118 --> 12:27.745
That's all you Want?

12:27.886 --> 12:31.083
My name is Iroh,
and you have my Word.

12:32.891 --> 12:34.825
Grandma, I knoW
you're gonna try to stop us,

12:34.960 --> 12:37.758
- but this is just something I need...
- Sit doWn.

12:39.364 --> 12:43.460
I kneW from the first time
We discovered you Were a Bender,

12:43.602 --> 12:46.537
that one day,
I Would realize your destiny.

12:47.439 --> 12:52.206
There hasn't been a Waterbender
in the Southern Water Tribe

12:52.344 --> 12:55.245
since my friend Hama Was taken aWay.

12:56.882 --> 13:00.545
Today, I found out that destiny.

13:01.587 --> 13:03.214
Did you see that boy's tattoos?

13:04.156 --> 13:07.557
Tattoos like that haven't
been seen in over a century.

13:08.560 --> 13:12.155
I believe they are Airbending tattoos.

13:12.531 --> 13:14.396
HoW can that be?

13:14.533 --> 13:19.561
I believe that little boy
might be the Avatar.

13:22.407 --> 13:27.936
Once, a long time ago,
the Spirit World kept balance over us.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.105
What is the Spirit World, Grandma?

13:30.249 --> 13:33.275
It's not a place made up
of things you can touch.

13:33.418 --> 13:36.148
But it exists, nonetheless.

13:37.389 --> 13:42.258
It is filled With the most amazing forms
of dazzling creatures...

13:42.761 --> 13:48.358
...that exist in the most
exotic valleys, mountains and forests.

13:49.268 --> 13:53.034
Each of these creatures is a Spirit.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.697
They've Watched over us
since the beginning.

13:55.841 --> 14:00.505
They have guided us. And only
the Avatar can go speak to them.

14:00.646 --> 14:02.375
Aren't there Spirits here?

14:02.614 --> 14:06.448
Yes, there are some Spirits
that live hidden among us,

14:06.585 --> 14:09.850
sure they're Watching us
With great sadness...

14:11.456 --> 14:16.018
The Fire Nation doesn't Wish
to live by the Spirits.

14:16.161 --> 14:19.619
That's Why they're so frightened
by the existence of the Avatar.

14:20.132 --> 14:23.590
- What can he do?
- With his mastery of the four elements,

14:23.735 --> 14:27.637
he Will begin to change hearts.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.974
And it is in the heart
that all Wars are Won.

14:35.814 --> 14:38.806
NoW, go help this boy.

14:40.219 --> 14:41.880
He Will need you tWo.

14:43.488 --> 14:46.150
And We all need him.

15:48.754 --> 15:51.621
You are my prisoner...

15:52.724 --> 15:54.385
...Airbender.

15:56.662 --> 15:58.220
I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.

15:58.630 --> 16:01.098
- You said...
- I apologize.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.167
I should have explained further.

16:03.302 --> 16:08.239
If you failed the test, as all others
did, you Were free to leave.

16:08.373 --> 16:13.333
But, as it turns out, you are
the only one in the entire World

16:13.478 --> 16:15.378
Who could pass this test.

16:16.748 --> 16:18.978
It is truly an honor
to be in your presence.

16:20.852 --> 16:23.582
Don't even try to escape.
This is a Warship!

16:28.694 --> 16:30.093
Stop! There's no Way you can...

17:09.201 --> 17:11.464
Don't move! You have noWhere to run!

17:11.770 --> 17:12.759
Halt!

17:13.372 --> 17:14.862
Don't let him escape!

17:15.307 --> 17:16.296
Get him!

17:38.730 --> 17:40.493
Thanks for bringing Appa to me.

17:40.632 --> 17:43.658
The Fire Nation is up to something.
I have to go back noW.

17:43.802 --> 17:46.896
- We'll come With you.
- I can take you back to the village.

17:49.007 --> 17:50.167
We're going With you.

17:53.278 --> 17:55.405
You found the Avatar.

17:57.249 --> 18:00.582
For a moment, I had my honor back.

18:02.087 --> 18:07.423
Your destinies are tied, Zuko.
That, you can be sure of.

18:13.365 --> 18:17.358
Aang flew us to his home. He told us
how he left there in a storm on Appa,

18:17.602 --> 18:20.435
and got forced into the ocean
where they almost drowned.

18:20.572 --> 18:23.336
Aang Airbended a sphere around them,
and ice formed.

18:23.475 --> 18:25.943
And he couldn't remember
anything after that.

18:26.111 --> 18:29.444
Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back!

18:29.781 --> 18:32.875
Hey, guys! I Want you to meet someone!

18:33.785 --> 18:35.446
This is Where you live?

18:35.587 --> 18:37.782
They must be playing some trick
or something.

18:37.923 --> 18:40.790
Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out
and scare me at any moment.

18:41.259 --> 18:43.193
He's the teacher responsible for me.

18:45.764 --> 18:47.391
He's kind of like my father.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.463
- Is it OK if you tell me your name?
- The monks named me Aang.

18:53.472 --> 18:56.134
OK, guys! Enough!

18:58.477 --> 19:01.310
Spider-rat!
They're poisonous! Get behind me.

19:02.481 --> 19:05.143
He's a flying lemur-bat.
We keep them as pets.

19:05.417 --> 19:06.975
Weren't they extinct a long time ago?

19:07.986 --> 19:11.422
Extinct? No, there must be thousands
of them on this mountain.

19:14.226 --> 19:16.160
Your friends Were monks?

19:16.294 --> 19:19.127
I knoW Where they are right noW.
They're at the prayer field!

19:23.168 --> 19:26.501
Aang, Wait! I have to talk to you!

19:37.182 --> 19:38.513
Aang...

19:39.518 --> 19:44.353
...I think you Were in that ice
for almost a hundred years.

19:46.691 --> 19:51.651
- The Firebenders started a War.
- I left a feW days ago.

19:52.497 --> 19:57.366
Aang, the Fire Nation kneW the Avatar
Would be born into the Air Nomads...

19:58.870 --> 20:01.202
...so they exterminated
all the Air Nomads.

20:11.716 --> 20:12.705
You're lying!

20:13.218 --> 20:14.879
You're lying!

20:26.298 --> 20:28.289
This is Monk Gyatso's.

20:29.234 --> 20:30.895
I made it for him.

20:43.915 --> 20:47.316
No!

21:03.768 --> 21:06.532
Katara! Stay aWay from him!

21:10.609 --> 21:11.598
Katara!

21:11.876 --> 21:13.537
Stay away from him!

21:18.216 --> 21:19.808
Your friends were monks?

21:49.714 --> 21:51.045
The Avatar?

21:52.484 --> 21:55.351
Where have you been?

21:55.487 --> 21:56.818
Aang!

21:57.155 --> 21:59.783
You can't bring Monk Gyatso back,

21:59.924 --> 22:03.587
but Sokka and I can be with you
as long as you need!

22:03.928 --> 22:07.728
Don't give up! We can do this together!

22:08.833 --> 22:10.323
Aang!

22:46.304 --> 22:48.033
The banished prince.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.536
Let's offer him lunch.

22:55.680 --> 22:59.275
I Wanted to thank
the great General Iroh

22:59.417 --> 23:02.682
and young Prince Zuko
for dining With us.

23:05.356 --> 23:09.918
As you knoW, the Fire Lord
has banished his son, the Prince,

23:10.061 --> 23:13.224
and renounced his love of him, and Will
not let him return to the throne

23:13.364 --> 23:15.059
unless he finds the Avatar.

23:16.134 --> 23:19.399
The Fire Lord believes his son
is too soft,

23:19.537 --> 23:22.438
and by doing this,
he Will become strong

23:22.574 --> 23:25.566
and become a Worthy heir
to the throne.

23:26.911 --> 23:29.436
I commend the Fire Lord's discipline.

23:29.581 --> 23:33.574
For example, it seems
I need to remind Prince Zuko

23:33.718 --> 23:38.087
that, during his banishment,
he is an enemy of the Fire Nation

23:38.223 --> 23:41.351
and is not alloWed
to Wear the Fire Nation uniform.

23:42.927 --> 23:45.327
But We Will let him Wear it today,

23:45.463 --> 23:47.693
like a child Wearing a costume.

23:55.774 --> 24:00.609
One day, my father Will take me back
and you Will boW before me.

25:13.518 --> 25:14.576
You OK?

25:16.187 --> 25:17.711
I'll be fine.

25:17.856 --> 25:21.690
You knoW, my grandma thinks
because you're an Airbender,

25:21.826 --> 25:23.191
that you could be the Avatar.

25:26.064 --> 25:28.191
HoW much does
the Fire Nation control?

25:29.367 --> 25:32.336
A lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom,
like around here.

25:32.470 --> 25:35.735
They haven't been able to conquer
big cities, like Ba Sing Se,

25:35.874 --> 25:38.035
but they're making plans, I'm sure.

25:39.377 --> 25:40.708
So...

25:41.546 --> 25:43.810
...are you the Avatar, Aang?

25:50.555 --> 25:51.886
What is this?

25:53.157 --> 25:54.283
Stay hidden.

26:01.399 --> 26:03.697
- That child is being arrested.
- For What?

26:03.835 --> 26:08.169
He Was bending tiny stones at us
from behind a tree. It really hurt.

26:08.306 --> 26:09.534
He can bend earth?

26:10.408 --> 26:13.002
Earthbending is forbidden
in this village.

26:13.745 --> 26:17.579
Leave him alone.
You're not taking him anywhere.

26:18.116 --> 26:21.483
No one is taking anybody aWay!

26:24.989 --> 26:26.047
She's a bender!

26:31.930 --> 26:33.261
Katara!

26:56.120 --> 26:57.280
Move.

26:58.122 --> 26:59.282
You, too.

26:59.424 --> 27:00.413
Dad!

27:04.462 --> 27:07.226
- This is my father.
- Hello.

27:07.365 --> 27:11.131
That's the Fire Nation's plan,
suppress all other bending.

27:13.304 --> 27:15.636
HoW did this happen to your village?

27:17.141 --> 27:21.475
Fire Nation sent soldiers.
We fought them and defeated them.

27:22.647 --> 27:27.516
Then they sent their machines,
huge machines made of metal.

27:27.652 --> 27:29.643
There Was nothing We could do.

27:31.222 --> 27:34.248
Those Who could not bend Were
alloWed to live in peace,

27:34.392 --> 27:35.984
if We Were imprisoned.

27:48.172 --> 27:49.332
Earthbenders!

27:52.844 --> 27:58.180
Why are you acting this Way?
You are poWerful and amazing people!

27:58.316 --> 28:02.685
You don't need to live like this!
There is earth right beneath your feet.

28:04.322 --> 28:07.519
The ground is an extension
of Who you are!

28:10.762 --> 28:12.696
If the Avatar had returned...

28:14.532 --> 28:16.056
...Would that mean anything to you?

28:16.200 --> 28:21.137
The Avatar is dead.
If he Was here, he Would protect us.

28:22.940 --> 28:24.373
My name is Aang...

28:25.977 --> 28:27.376
...and I am the Avatar.

28:29.213 --> 28:32.046
I ran aWay, but I'm back noW.

28:35.553 --> 28:38.044
It's time for you to stop doing this!

28:38.723 --> 28:43.717
The Avatar Would have to be an
Airbender. Are you an Airbender, boy?

28:46.564 --> 28:48.225
Leave him alone!

28:54.572 --> 28:56.437
HoW is he doing that?

28:56.574 --> 28:58.633
I don't Want to hurt anyone.

28:58.776 --> 29:02.803
All Airbenders should be dead.
Kill him! Firebenders, positions!

29:06.584 --> 29:10.247
OK! Everybody can help us noW!

29:33.377 --> 29:35.436
Don't be afraid!

30:13.151 --> 30:14.641
Just leave them!

30:15.653 --> 30:17.086
Fall back!

30:18.089 --> 30:20.148
Go! He's an Airbender!

30:40.011 --> 30:44.277
They took aWay any tools
related to bending.

30:57.929 --> 31:01.797
The Fire Nation took this scroll
from a member of your Water Tribe.

31:03.534 --> 31:05.525
A Waterbending scroll.

31:10.208 --> 31:13.939
This is rare.
My mom told me about these.

31:15.813 --> 31:19.271
This Was you When
you Were born an Earthbender,

31:19.417 --> 31:21.885
tWo lifetimes ago.

31:22.019 --> 31:23.418
You came to our village.

31:24.355 --> 31:28.655
Avatar Kyoshi loved games.

31:28.793 --> 31:32.194
I do, too.
I mean, I still do.

31:33.197 --> 31:35.995
A lot of the villages in this part
of the Earth Kingdom are occupied

31:36.133 --> 31:38.226
by the Fire Nation,
like this village Was.

31:38.836 --> 31:42.397
They prey on the Weakest toWns
and villages.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.508
We should go visit
some of these toWns, Aang.

31:44.642 --> 31:47.202
- I need to tell you something.
- What is it, Aang?

31:48.746 --> 31:52.204
I ran aWay before they trained me
to be the Avatar.

31:52.350 --> 31:54.341
I don't knoW hoW
to bend the other elements.

31:55.853 --> 31:57.480
Why did you run aWay?

31:57.989 --> 32:01.254
The day they told me I Was the Avatar,
they said I could never

32:01.392 --> 32:04.327
have a normal life,
that I could never have a family.

32:04.762 --> 32:07.856
They said it cannot Work With
the responsibilities of the Avatar.

32:07.999 --> 32:11.196
- Why can't the Avatar have a family?
- I asked that!

32:11.335 --> 32:14.702
They said that's the sacrifice
the Avatar alWays has to make.

32:14.839 --> 32:18.366
OK. So, What if We found you teachers.
Teachers to teach you bending?

32:18.509 --> 32:20.374
Which element Would you
have to learn first?

32:20.511 --> 32:23.776
Water. Water comes
after Air in the cycle.

32:23.914 --> 32:26.474
Air, Water, Earth, Fire.

32:26.617 --> 32:29.677
But there are really poWerful benders
in the Northern Water Tribe.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.615
My dad told me about it before he left.

32:31.756 --> 32:34.122
It's led by a princess because
her father died.

32:34.258 --> 32:37.318
There are teachers there, but all
the Way on the other side of the World.

32:37.461 --> 32:40.123
- We can get there on Appa.
- That's What I Was thinking.

32:40.264 --> 32:42.357
And maybe We can stop
in the villages on the Way,

32:42.500 --> 32:45.025
start a change in The War
in these small villages.

32:45.870 --> 32:48.395
- Should We try it?
- Yes, We should.

33:42.660 --> 33:45.720
The scroll we had
was proving to be helpful.

33:45.863 --> 33:49.526
Aang was practicing,
but for some reason,

33:49.667 --> 33:52.101
he was having trouble
with Waterbending.

33:59.343 --> 34:02.471
We moved from town to town
in the Earth Kingdom.

34:02.613 --> 34:04.137
We tried to stay out of sight,

34:04.281 --> 34:08.877
but Sokka became concerned
we were being followed.

34:41.485 --> 34:43.851
Sire, I have good neWs.

34:43.987 --> 34:46.353
As you knoW, I conducted a raid
on the Great Library,

34:46.489 --> 34:48.719
- Which most said didn't exist.
- Get on With it.

34:48.926 --> 34:53.920
I found scrolls in the library.
We are deciphering them.

34:54.063 --> 34:56.054
But I believe they may
contain information

34:56.199 --> 34:59.431
as to Where the Ocean and Moon
Spirits live in this World.

34:59.570 --> 35:01.265
With this information,

35:01.405 --> 35:03.930
We could bring doWn
the Northern Water Tribe city,

35:04.074 --> 35:07.771
We could shoW the World
the true strength of fire.

35:07.912 --> 35:09.573
I am pleased.

35:10.247 --> 35:14.980
Well, Commander Zhao,
are the rumors true or not?

35:15.119 --> 35:19.180
Our spies have discovered someone
claiming to be the Avatar.

35:20.424 --> 35:22.358
They describe him as just a boy.

35:23.861 --> 35:25.920
We should set a trap for this person.

35:26.063 --> 35:28.657
We have many Earth Kingdom people
under our control.

35:28.799 --> 35:31.996
I can leave soldiers
hidden in certain locations.

35:32.136 --> 35:36.903
- And my son?
- He had his chance. He missed it.

35:38.209 --> 35:40.200
Let's hope, for your sake,

35:40.344 --> 35:45.213
my son doesn't find this person first
and he turns out to be the Avatar.

35:46.250 --> 35:50.243
He Would return as a hero and,
for all purposes, be your superior.

35:52.022 --> 35:56.083
Well, I suppose it's a race, then.

36:16.580 --> 36:18.241
We're close, Uncle.

36:18.883 --> 36:21.750
They've been moving
farther and farther north.

36:23.554 --> 36:24.919
We're catching them.

36:29.627 --> 36:32.095
There are a lot of pretty girls
in this toWn, Zuko.

36:33.097 --> 36:35.190
You could fall in love here.

36:35.332 --> 36:39.769
We could settle doWn here,
and you could have a blessed life.

36:42.573 --> 36:44.939
We don't have to continue this, Zuko.

36:47.111 --> 36:49.602
I'll shoW you Why We must, Uncle.

36:52.049 --> 36:56.179
Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.

37:01.292 --> 37:03.624
You look like a very smart boy.

37:05.729 --> 37:09.927
Tell me What you knoW about the
Prince, the Fire Lord's son.

37:10.067 --> 37:14.936
- He did something Wrong.
- He spoke out of turn to a general,

37:15.072 --> 37:17.063
in defense of some of his friends

37:17.207 --> 37:21.143
Who Were going to be sacrificed
in a battle.

37:21.278 --> 37:25.806
Then Prince Zuko
Was sentenced to an Agni Kai duel,

37:25.950 --> 37:27.417
but When he shoWed up,

37:27.551 --> 37:31.419
- it was his father he was to fight.
- That's right.

37:31.655 --> 37:34.180
He would not fight his father.

37:34.325 --> 37:38.352
Then his father mocked him and said,

37:38.495 --> 37:41.157
"I should bring your sister
up here to beat you."

37:42.533 --> 37:45.229
Then the father burnt his son...

37:46.337 --> 37:47.827
...to teach him a lesson.

37:58.349 --> 38:00.180
We'll catch him soon, Uncle.

38:01.285 --> 38:03.845
Then We can think
about the pretty girls.

38:14.365 --> 38:15.662
Aang...

38:15.799 --> 38:18.029
Try to keep your Wrist bent,
like it's shoWing.

38:21.872 --> 38:25.899
What's Wrong?
You've really been distracted today.

38:26.043 --> 38:29.911
I saW Sokka's maps.
We're near the Northern Air Temple.

38:30.047 --> 38:33.813
Do you think it Would be OK
if I just visited there and came back?

38:33.951 --> 38:36.715
- I'd be back in less than a day.
- Why?

38:36.854 --> 38:39.721
He had a vision
at the Southern Air Temple prayer field.

38:39.857 --> 38:42.849
He talked to a Dragon Spirit
Who he thinks can help us.

38:42.993 --> 38:45.518
He thinks if he goes
to another spiritual place,

38:45.663 --> 38:47.392
he can get back to the Spirit World.

38:47.531 --> 38:51.297
I don't think that's a good idea.
We started a rebellion.

38:52.069 --> 38:53.900
Try to talk him out of it.

39:46.724 --> 39:48.453
I can't do this.

39:49.093 --> 39:50.219
I need help.

40:01.472 --> 40:04.373
- I guess your talk didn't Work.
- He'll be back in a day.

40:04.942 --> 40:08.571
The Fire Nation is folloWing us. If We
make a Wrong move, they'll catch him.

40:47.284 --> 40:48.751
Who are you?

40:51.688 --> 40:54.020
Why, it cannot be!

40:54.858 --> 40:58.191
I've heard stories. Are you?

40:58.996 --> 41:00.588
My name is Aang.

41:01.198 --> 41:05.191
I cannot believe
I've lived to see your return.

41:06.103 --> 41:10.199
I'm an Earth villager,
but I visit these temple remains often.

41:10.340 --> 41:14.436
The Fire Nation destroyed this temple.
They have ruined everything.

41:14.578 --> 41:17.741
No, no, no, not everything.

41:17.881 --> 41:21.749
You knoW, there's
a hidden chamber of statues

41:21.885 --> 41:24.649
I think you, of all people, should see.

41:25.255 --> 41:27.883
These are all the Avatars.

41:28.892 --> 41:32.885
These are the reincarnations
of you over the years.

41:35.799 --> 41:39.565
The Avatar Roku Was your last life.

41:42.472 --> 41:47.068
NoW, hoW did the Airbenders knoW
you Were the Avatar, little one?

41:49.112 --> 41:50.909
They gave me a test.

41:51.849 --> 41:55.751
They put 1,000 toys in front of me
and asked me to choose four.

41:56.587 --> 42:00.489
They said I chose the same four objects
that belonged to the previous Avatars.

42:03.694 --> 42:06.026
That's When they told me
I could have no family.

42:07.898 --> 42:11.163
Told me I had a responsibility
to the Four Nations.

42:15.739 --> 42:18.503
There's a ceremony
When everyone boWs to me.

42:20.744 --> 42:23.110
That's When I accept my role
as the Avatar.

42:25.282 --> 42:27.045
But When everyone boWed...

42:30.687 --> 42:32.678
...I didn't boW back.

42:33.123 --> 42:35.455
You seem like a nice young man.

42:36.727 --> 42:42.666
You really do.
You Will forgive me, Won't you?

42:44.067 --> 42:46.797
- For What?
- For luring you doWn here.

42:50.207 --> 42:54.303
I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar.

42:54.444 --> 42:57.880
So you Will understand
my actions today.

43:19.002 --> 43:23.336
I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar.

43:29.179 --> 43:33.616
I have seen a vision
of the moon turning red.

43:34.418 --> 43:39.549
The Fire Nation has stolen knoWledge
of us from the Great Library.

43:39.690 --> 43:42.989
They are planning
to misuse this knoWledge.

43:43.126 --> 43:44.457
I Will stop them.

43:44.594 --> 43:48.655
You must go
to the Northern Water Tribe.

43:48.799 --> 43:52.394
If they take that city,
more Will suffer and die,

43:52.536 --> 43:54.766
as your Airbenders have.

43:55.339 --> 43:57.739
You must go noW!

43:57.874 --> 43:59.136
Will I stop them?

43:59.276 --> 44:00.607
Wake up, young man!

44:03.547 --> 44:07.608
My name is Commander Zhao.
I set this trap for you.

44:09.820 --> 44:12.721
Don't Worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

44:13.924 --> 44:18.418
Besides, you'd just be reborn again,

44:18.562 --> 44:20.723
and then the search Would continue.

44:24.201 --> 44:27.898
So Where have you been all this time?

44:29.573 --> 44:31.905
And hoW is it that you're still a boy?

44:35.145 --> 44:37.477
I understand that When you freed
that handful of toWns,

44:37.614 --> 44:39.912
you Were very impressive, but...

44:41.618 --> 44:45.247
...you only used Airbending
against my soldiers.

44:47.257 --> 44:49.248
NoW, Why is that?

45:02.105 --> 45:04.573
The Fire Lord and I have a plan

45:04.708 --> 45:09.236
to ensure our reign
and the doWnfall of our enemies.

45:09.379 --> 45:12.439
I am sending a personal message
to the Fire Lord,

45:12.682 --> 45:15.480
informing him
that the once feared Avatar

45:15.619 --> 45:19.817
is our prisoner
and no threat to our might.

45:56.626 --> 45:57.923
Who are you?

46:00.797 --> 46:01.889
Wait! Don't!

46:02.999 --> 46:04.330
Stop!

46:31.695 --> 46:33.026
Fools.

46:34.631 --> 46:38.294
Close the inner gates!
The Avatar has escaped!

46:47.043 --> 46:48.806
Lock doWn the gate!

46:50.046 --> 46:52.378
Lock doWn all the gates!

47:06.930 --> 47:09.330
To the main post!

47:10.000 --> 47:11.160
This Was their practice area.

47:11.301 --> 47:13.895
Go again!

49:16.159 --> 49:18.457
Do not kill the Avatar!

49:18.595 --> 49:20.290
He Will just be reborn again!

49:21.931 --> 49:23.523
Why are you doing this? Who are you?

49:35.078 --> 49:36.136
Open the gates.

49:37.981 --> 49:39.471
Let them out!

49:55.965 --> 49:59.332
- Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?
- Not at all.

50:01.004 --> 50:02.335
Do it.

50:52.922 --> 50:54.219
What is this?

51:52.282 --> 51:55.274
And hoW did he escape?

51:57.287 --> 52:01.781
I fear that your son
is not only incompetent,

52:01.925 --> 52:03.790
but also a traitor.

52:04.461 --> 52:06.691
Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.

52:10.467 --> 52:12.128
You think...

52:12.802 --> 52:15.965
...my son is this person

52:16.105 --> 52:19.370
the soldiers are calling
the Blue Spirit.

52:22.479 --> 52:23.946
Yes.

52:29.452 --> 52:32.478
Zhao's men Were searching the coast,
looking for you.

52:33.490 --> 52:35.651
They also searched the ship.

52:36.960 --> 52:39.827
I told them you Went
on vacation With a girl.

52:43.500 --> 52:45.627
Where Were you the past four days?

52:48.171 --> 52:49.502
NoWhere.

52:51.274 --> 52:53.071
We have to keep moving.

52:54.377 --> 52:56.402
The Avatar is traveling again.

52:57.514 --> 52:59.345
Take rest first.

53:00.183 --> 53:02.743
It looks like you
Went through a great deal.

53:03.586 --> 53:08.353
When you Wake, We'll have tea together
before We start the engines.

53:17.700 --> 53:19.861
Do not harm my son.

53:20.837 --> 53:23.362
Leave him to his isolation.

53:24.040 --> 53:28.067
You have my word, sire.
I will not harm him.

53:54.070 --> 53:55.731
Zuko!

54:08.017 --> 54:09.917
And what of the Avatar?

54:10.253 --> 54:13.051
We assume he has
rejoined with his supporters.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.600
It has been confirmed
that he's traveling north.

54:25.868 --> 54:29.497
It is my strong belief that he is
traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.

54:30.440 --> 54:35.104
I believe the child Avatar has only
knowledge of his birth element, Air.

54:36.045 --> 54:40.175
I believe he is trying to learn
in the discipline of water.

54:40.316 --> 54:43.547
He's gone to seek out someone
in the Northern Water Tribe,

54:43.686 --> 54:48.589
where they have lived beyond our reach
and openly practice Waterbending.

55:34.203 --> 55:37.263
We arrived at the Northern Water Tribe.

55:37.407 --> 55:40.171
We presented ourselves
to the royal court.

55:43.246 --> 55:46.841
My brother and the princess
became friends right away.

56:01.364 --> 56:04.492
Aang showed them he
was the last Airbender,

56:04.634 --> 56:07.364
and was accepted
to train with the master.

56:23.386 --> 56:26.651
The city knew our arrival
would bring great danger.

56:26.789 --> 56:30.885
And they prepared for war they knew
would come in the ensuing weeks.

56:34.897 --> 56:38.060
The city Was designed
to Withstand any assault.

56:38.401 --> 56:41.837
If We keep them to the courtyard
and the marketplace till night falls,

56:42.071 --> 56:45.131
Where We have the advantage,
We Will succeed.

56:45.808 --> 56:47.571
If We let too many of them
into the city,

56:47.710 --> 56:50.076
their sheer numbers
could overwhelm us.

56:50.747 --> 56:54.513
As many fires in this city should be put
out as possible When the alarm sounds.

56:54.650 --> 56:58.177
We Want to minimize
their bender sources.

56:59.589 --> 57:02.490
I must assign a guard
to be With you at all times, Princess.

57:02.959 --> 57:06.417
Your presence is our inspiration.

57:06.562 --> 57:09.531
I'll do it. That's me.
I'll be her guard.

57:09.665 --> 57:11.223
Nothing Will happen to her.

57:13.536 --> 57:16.004
I had a feeling you might volunteer.

57:18.975 --> 57:21.842
I've heard no word of my son
for quite some time.

57:21.978 --> 57:25.778
- Do you know where he is?
- I've not heard of anything, sire.

57:25.915 --> 57:28.816
I'm sure word of him
will come to us soon.

57:28.951 --> 57:31.715
The Northern Water Tribe benders
are given their strength

57:31.854 --> 57:35.620
by the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
They Will be difficult to defeat.

57:35.892 --> 57:40.056
NoW, if for some reason
the Spirits Were not involved,

57:40.196 --> 57:41.959
that Would be different.

57:43.900 --> 57:46.801
What have you learned
from the stolen scrolls?

57:47.470 --> 57:51.702
We have deciphered the location
of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.

57:54.477 --> 57:59.471
It is our destiny to have found
this information, Zhao.

58:02.919 --> 58:05.353
Eliminate the Spirits,

58:05.488 --> 58:09.982
take the city and We Will have
thWarted the Avatar in the process.

58:22.438 --> 58:23.996
Water is What?

58:24.140 --> 58:26.734
The floWing element.
The element of change.

58:28.010 --> 58:31.173
To master Water,
you must release your emotions,

58:31.314 --> 58:33.544
Wherever they may lead you.

58:33.683 --> 58:36.345
Water teaches us acceptance.

58:37.353 --> 58:40.015
Let your emotions floW like Water.

58:41.624 --> 58:45.924
Aang, Would you like to spar?
You haven't sparred in a feW days.

59:18.427 --> 59:20.054
NoW, use offense, Aang!

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:17.716
General Iroh, I'm glad you could
accept my invitation to join us

01:00:17.853 --> 01:00:22.119
- on this historic event.
- Your invitation Was most gracious.

01:00:22.258 --> 01:00:25.625
You are a gifted strategist.
No one can argue that.

01:00:26.028 --> 01:00:30.965
Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege
of Ba Sing Se Won't be held against you.

01:00:31.968 --> 01:00:34.960
Your son died in that siege, didn't he?

01:00:36.872 --> 01:00:38.134
Yes, he did.

01:00:39.742 --> 01:00:42.768
Again, I offer my condolences
on your nepheW burning to death

01:00:42.912 --> 01:00:44.812
in that terrible accident.

01:00:47.149 --> 01:00:48.275
Thank you.

01:00:56.325 --> 01:00:58.793
I've loved spending
these Weeks With you, Sokka.

01:00:58.928 --> 01:01:00.418
Me, too.

01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:07.435
Should We see What the ocean
is doing today?

01:01:14.176 --> 01:01:16.144
When there is some safety for all of us,

01:01:16.278 --> 01:01:19.111
I Will come visit our sister city
in the Southern Water Tribe

01:01:19.248 --> 01:01:21.478
and spend some time in your home.

01:01:22.018 --> 01:01:23.508
That Would be great.

01:01:25.688 --> 01:01:27.451
But I Warn you...

01:01:28.457 --> 01:01:32.188
...my grandmother Will ask you
a lot of questions.

01:01:39.268 --> 01:01:40.860
What might she ask me?

01:01:42.705 --> 01:01:47.699
She'll say, "Why is your hair White,
young lady? You look very odd."

01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:52.909
I Would say to your grandmother, my
hair is White because When I Was born

01:01:53.049 --> 01:01:55.074
I Was not aWake.

01:01:55.217 --> 01:01:59.051
My mother and father could not get me
to make a sound or move.

01:01:59.722 --> 01:02:01.747
So they prayed for days
to the Moon Spirit

01:02:01.891 --> 01:02:04.724
and dipped me into the sacred Waters.

01:02:06.896 --> 01:02:11.890
My parents said that my hair turned
White then and life poured into me.

01:02:13.736 --> 01:02:14.896
WoW.

01:02:16.739 --> 01:02:18.400
You didn't tell me that.

01:02:19.575 --> 01:02:21.566
You didn't ask me.

01:02:22.144 --> 01:02:23.907
Only your grandmother did.

01:02:29.919 --> 01:02:33.082
I'm sure Zhao Was the one
Who ordered the attack on you.

01:02:36.759 --> 01:02:38.420
Any problems?

01:02:39.495 --> 01:02:42.862
We have arrived at the Northern
Water Tribe's stronghold.

01:02:42.998 --> 01:02:44.431
They believe the boy is there.

01:02:46.769 --> 01:02:48.669
Why do you seem upset, Uncle?

01:02:50.272 --> 01:02:52.467
Zhao has no sacredness.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:55.010
Are you sure you Want to be here?

01:02:58.447 --> 01:03:02.941
I Will not be alloWed to live in peace
until I bring the Avatar to my father!

01:03:03.285 --> 01:03:05.014
Is that not clear to you?

01:04:15.357 --> 01:04:16.847
What is this?

01:04:18.194 --> 01:04:19.525
Yue...

01:04:21.363 --> 01:04:22.955
...the Fire Nation is here.

01:04:46.055 --> 01:04:49.218
NoW be sure to keep your uniform
closed up to your neck.

01:04:49.558 --> 01:04:52.049
And remember, your Chi can Warm you.

01:04:53.395 --> 01:04:54.794
I knoW, Uncle.

01:05:07.576 --> 01:05:08.907
Be safe.

01:06:11.874 --> 01:06:13.466
Aang needs to ask you something.

01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:16.540
I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit.

01:06:17.313 --> 01:06:19.304
He can help me defeat the Fire Nation.

01:06:20.482 --> 01:06:22.746
Is there a spiritual place
Where I can meditate?

01:06:22.885 --> 01:06:27.413
There is a very spiritual place.
The city Was built around this place.

01:06:28.223 --> 01:06:30.020
But we must hurry.

01:06:49.878 --> 01:06:53.041
Momo, be nice.

01:06:55.684 --> 01:06:57.982
To get your Airbending tattoos,

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:03.217
you have to meditate for long
periods of time Without losing focus.

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:07.352
Some of the great monks
can meditate for four days.

01:07:23.479 --> 01:07:26.346
- I have to get back.
- I'll take you.

01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:30.384
I'll stay With him.

01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:51.967
Aang?

01:07:54.743 --> 01:07:56.574
Aang, can you hear me?

01:07:59.748 --> 01:08:01.739
I kneW you Were real.

01:08:03.085 --> 01:08:05.918
I alWays kneW you'd return.

01:08:06.922 --> 01:08:08.321
Me, too.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.589
The Fire Lord's son.

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:17.023
You took him from our village.

01:08:43.392 --> 01:08:44.950
Who are you?

01:08:45.661 --> 01:08:47.252
My name is Katara,

01:08:47.395 --> 01:08:50.296
and I'm the only Waterbender left
in the Southern Water Tribe.

01:09:11.787 --> 01:09:13.720
- Go for the children.
- Yes.

01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:30.002
I'm not alloWed to go home Without him.

01:10:08.544 --> 01:10:10.944
The Waterbenders get poWer
from the moon.

01:10:11.079 --> 01:10:13.309
They Will get stronger
as the day comes to an end.

01:10:15.117 --> 01:10:17.881
General Iroh,
I've been keeping a secret.

01:10:18.754 --> 01:10:20.153
And What is that?

01:10:20.556 --> 01:10:23.923
In my raid of the Great Library
earlier this year,

01:10:24.059 --> 01:10:26.493
I found a scroll that tells

01:10:26.628 --> 01:10:29.188
the location
of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.

01:10:29.898 --> 01:10:32.492
To meet a Spirit Would be a great honor.

01:10:36.605 --> 01:10:38.732
Well, I hope I can give you that honor.

01:11:19.615 --> 01:11:20.775
What happened?

01:11:22.451 --> 01:11:23.611
What happened?

01:11:24.386 --> 01:11:28.345
Prince Zuko's here in the city.
He took Aang again.

01:11:41.136 --> 01:11:44.071
We'll just Wait
till everyone's fighting everyone.

01:11:45.774 --> 01:11:48.470
Then in the night, We'll slip out.

01:11:49.978 --> 01:11:51.969
Aang, can you hear me?

01:11:55.484 --> 01:11:57.247
I knew you were real.

01:11:58.654 --> 01:12:01.487
I always knew you'd return.

01:12:03.892 --> 01:12:06.156
Hello! Hello!

01:12:09.064 --> 01:12:12.659
Please, tell me hoW
to beat the Fire Nation!

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:29.046
You are not dealing
With the loss of your people,

01:12:29.184 --> 01:12:32.676
and your responsibility
for their deaths.

01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:35.851
You are stopping yourself
from grieving.

01:12:36.191 --> 01:12:37.852
You are angry.

01:12:38.193 --> 01:12:41.526
You must let this go.

01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:46.690
As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others.

01:12:59.114 --> 01:13:00.376
Use the ocean.

01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:04.576
ShoW them the poWer of Water.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.212
Go! Do this noW.

01:13:11.226 --> 01:13:15.162
My sister Azula
was always the special one.

01:13:15.764 --> 01:13:17.959
She Was a Firebending prodigy.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.727
My father loves her.

01:13:28.076 --> 01:13:30.567
He can't even look at me sometimes.

01:13:32.714 --> 01:13:34.409
He says I'm like my mother.

01:14:27.335 --> 01:14:29.462
I advise that you
pull back your men soon.

01:14:29.604 --> 01:14:32.573
They Will be trapped in the city
When the moon's poWer comes out.

01:14:32.707 --> 01:14:35.608
Do not Worry about the moon's poWer,
General Iroh.

01:14:35.744 --> 01:14:37.837
Why should you not be Worried
about the moon's poWer?

01:14:37.979 --> 01:14:40.140
Because your brother,
Fire Lord Ozai, and I

01:14:40.382 --> 01:14:44.216
have decided it is in our best
interests to kill the Moon Spirit.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.480
What?

01:16:08.069 --> 01:16:10.560
Calm doWn. We'll find him.

01:16:53.114 --> 01:16:56.345
Are you OK?
Did the Spirits tell you anything?

01:16:56.484 --> 01:17:00.443
Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me.
I knoW What to do.

01:17:01.122 --> 01:17:03.784
Aang, We have to go.

01:17:27.148 --> 01:17:29.810
You Won't be killed by Waterbenders
if you stay hidden here.

01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:34.982
We could be friends, you knoW.

01:17:47.335 --> 01:17:49.235
They're getting stronger.

01:17:50.839 --> 01:17:55.173
This is a scroll from the Great Library.
This is our map.

01:17:55.977 --> 01:17:58.571
Our World is going to change soon,
gentlemen.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.043
Right there and right there.

01:18:24.139 --> 01:18:26.699
See Where they're going!
I'll go join the fight!

01:18:49.064 --> 01:18:54.559
They are called many names:
Yin and Yang, push and pull.

01:18:55.403 --> 01:19:00.170
May I introduce you to the mysterious
Ocean and Moon Spirits?

01:19:16.825 --> 01:19:19.885
Why do Spirits take the form
of such benign things?

01:19:20.028 --> 01:19:22.929
It leaves them so vulnerable.

01:19:23.064 --> 01:19:24.656
To teach man kindness and humility.

01:19:26.701 --> 01:19:28.669
Commander Zhao,

01:19:28.803 --> 01:19:32.466
there are certain things
humankind should not tamper With.

01:19:32.607 --> 01:19:34.939
The Spirits and the Spirit World
is one of them.

01:19:37.412 --> 01:19:39.175
What are you doing here?

01:19:39.314 --> 01:19:40.941
Stop, Zhao.

01:19:41.449 --> 01:19:45.215
The World Will go out of balance.
Everyone Will be hurt.

01:19:46.955 --> 01:19:51.324
The Fire Nation is too poWerful

01:19:51.459 --> 01:19:55.293
to Worry about children's superstitions,
General Iroh.

01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:59.227
Commander Zhao, don't.

01:20:07.809 --> 01:20:09.572
We are noW the gods!

01:20:10.478 --> 01:20:11.809
No!

01:20:27.829 --> 01:20:30.263
Man all battle stations!

01:20:35.837 --> 01:20:38.397
You are too soft, General Iroh.

01:20:53.087 --> 01:20:55.681
He's making fire out of nothing!

01:21:21.049 --> 01:21:22.880
They're breaching the Wall!

01:21:24.252 --> 01:21:26.015
To the front!

01:21:46.507 --> 01:21:50.910
As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others.

01:21:51.813 --> 01:21:54.907
You must show them
the power of Water.

01:21:59.087 --> 01:22:00.884
All is lost.

01:22:02.323 --> 01:22:04.757
You have been anointed
by the Moon Spirit.

01:22:05.493 --> 01:22:10.226
- He gave me life When I Was a child.
- Then there is still a chance.

01:22:11.266 --> 01:22:13.666
You can give your life
back for the Spirit's.

01:22:14.269 --> 01:22:18.569
- Don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation.
- Nothing is ever truly lost.

01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:27.209
- Is it mine to give back, if I choose?
- There are reasons each of us are born.

01:22:28.116 --> 01:22:30.380
We have to find those reasons.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:43.794
- This Was the reason I Was born.
- Yue, please.

01:22:45.133 --> 01:22:47.931
There is no love Without sacrifice.

01:22:48.069 --> 01:22:50.936
Yue, What are you doing?
You don't knoW What Will happen.

01:22:51.072 --> 01:22:54.508
I believe my life force Will leave my
body and return to the Moon Spirit.

01:22:54.642 --> 01:22:55.666
And then What?

01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:58.335
My soul Will no longer exist
in this form.

01:22:58.479 --> 01:23:01.607
Please don't do this.
There must be another Way.

01:23:01.749 --> 01:23:04.183
I can't let you do this.
I'm supposed to protect you.

01:23:04.319 --> 01:23:06.446
My people are dying, Sokka.

01:23:06.587 --> 01:23:09.351
Those Who are in charge of others
have a responsibility.

01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:12.220
It is time We shoW the Fire Nation
We believe in our beliefs

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.351
- as much as they believe in theirs.
- But Yue...

01:23:14.495 --> 01:23:18.659
I'm scared.
Don't make me any more scared.

01:23:20.668 --> 01:23:23.660
I Will miss you more than you knoW.

01:25:01.102 --> 01:25:02.296
I killed you.

01:25:04.505 --> 01:25:06.564
Come aWay from him, nepheW.

01:25:08.242 --> 01:25:10.301
There are too many soldiers noW.

01:25:10.445 --> 01:25:13.209
They Will never
let you take the Avatar.

01:25:14.182 --> 01:25:16.480
We must leave immediately.

01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:19.884
He Wants to fight you
so he can capture you, Zuko.

01:25:20.855 --> 01:25:22.345
Walk aWay!

01:25:25.259 --> 01:25:26.453
Come!

01:25:58.559 --> 01:26:00.049
You stand alone.

01:26:00.962 --> 01:26:03.760
And that has alWays
been your great mistake.

01:28:01.616 --> 01:28:04.346
Water teaches us acceptance.

01:28:05.019 --> 01:28:09.547
Let your emotions flow like water.

01:32:13.934 --> 01:32:15.265
Aang?

01:33:17.665 --> 01:33:20.327
They Want you to be their Avatar, Aang.

01:33:24.838 --> 01:33:26.328
We all do.

01:34:02.876 --> 01:34:06.573
Our forces in the Northern Water Tribe
have failed to take the city.

01:34:06.714 --> 01:34:09.581
General Zhao Was killed in battle
and my brother has become a traitor.

01:34:09.717 --> 01:34:11.912
My son's proven himself a failure.

01:34:13.387 --> 01:34:18.654
NoW, Sozin's Comet
is returning in three years.

01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:22.421
It Will give all Firebenders the ability
of the highest Firebenders,

01:34:22.563 --> 01:34:27.432
the ability to use their oWn Chi
to create Fire.

01:34:27.568 --> 01:34:31.766
That is the day We Will Win this War

01:34:31.905 --> 01:34:34.738
and prove the Fire Nation's dominance.

01:34:35.309 --> 01:34:39.939
NoW you must stop the Avatar
from mastering Earth and Fire.

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.072
You must give us the time
to get to that day.

01:34:44.084 --> 01:34:48.043
Do you accept this
unspeakably important task

01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:49.314
I'm putting in your hands?

01:34:55.929 --> 01:34:57.920
I do, Father.

01:34:58.305 --> 01:35:04.328
