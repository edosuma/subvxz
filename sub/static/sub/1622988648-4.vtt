(SCOFFS) Yeah, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.666
Uh, it fucking blew, frankly.

16:20.750 --> 16:21.833
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

16:21.916 --> 16:23.625
You put us on a boat
with a crazy lady

16:23.708 --> 16:26.333
who was having some kind of
fucking memorial service.

16:26.416 --> 16:29.083
You knew! You knew
that she was out there to spread

16:29.166 --> 16:31.166
her dead mother's ashes
on the goddamn ocean.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.000
Oh, well, she might've
mentioned that.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.541
I'm trying to do
a romantic gesture for my wife.

16:35.625 --> 16:36.958
I got a crazy lady
who's having

16:37.041 --> 16:38.958
some kind of fucking
nervous breakdown.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.916
So no, it was not romantic.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.708
It was a dumpster fire
shit show!

16:42.791 --> 16:44.083
I had no idea.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.625
I'm sorry your vacation isn't
everything you'd hoped-- so far.

16:48.166 --> 16:49.416
But the good news,

16:49.500 --> 16:52.541
there's an exciting surprise
you'll be receiving later today.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.916
What? We're gonna get
in our room?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.125
-Unfortunately, no.
-Jesus.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.208

gonna turn things around.

to your boss.

is at a conference this week.

in touch with him.

bring you his business card

17:28.625 --> 17:30.458
