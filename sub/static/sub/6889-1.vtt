00:07.090 --> 00:09.011
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli,
Nippon Television Network, Dentsu,

00:09.012 --> 00:11.572
Walt Disney Japan, Tohokushinsha
Film and Mitsubishi present

00:13.347 --> 00:16.096
<i>Good luck, Chihiro
Hope we meet again</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:19.098
Chihiro? Chihiro!

00:19.102 --> 00:20.770
We're almost there.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.608
This really is the
middle of nowhere.

00:25.609 --> 00:28.569
I'll have to shop in the next town.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.818
We'll just have to make do.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.159
Look, there's the
elementary school.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.158
That's your new school, Chihiro.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.282
Why, it looks very nice.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.126
I liked my old school.

00:54.137 --> 00:57.181
Mom, my flowers got bent.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.809
No wonder, the way
you squeeze them.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.980
A little water and
they'll perk right up.

01:03.814 --> 01:07.525
My first bouquet, and
it's farewell flowers.

01:07.526 --> 01:11.112
What about the rose you
got for your birthday?

01:11.113 --> 01:14.282
One rose? One rose isn't a bouquet.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.033
You dropped the card.

01:16.034 --> 01:20.614
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.

01:39.641 --> 01:45.018
SPIRITED AWAY

01:57.200 --> 02:01.371
Wait a minute. Did I
take a wrong turn?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.205
I don't get it.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.534
That must be it up there.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.416
The blue one on the end.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.172
That's it.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.250
I guess I turned off too soon.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.343
Maybe if we go straight?

02:15.344 --> 02:17.970
Oh, please. That's how
we always get lost.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.173
Let's just see what's up here.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.220
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.610
Dad, are you sure?

02:32.611 --> 02:35.405
Don't worry, we've
got 4-wheel drive.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.361
Sit down, Chihiro.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.842
What are you doing? Slow down!

03:01.139 --> 03:02.682
There's a tunnel.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.781
What's this building?

03:18.782 --> 03:20.825
It looks like a gate.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.784
Honey, I think we should go back.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.824
Chihiro!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.330
Honestly...

03:29.543 --> 03:32.086
Look at this, it's just plaster.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.289
This thing's pretty new.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.801
The air's blowing in.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.309
What is it?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.808
Let's see what's on the other side.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.558
It's creepy, Dad. Can't we go back?

03:52.816 --> 03:56.944
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.238
The movers will be there soon.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.409
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.577
I know, but...

04:04.578 --> 04:06.746
No! I won't go.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.708
Dad, let's go.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.334
Come on, it'll be fun.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.208
I'm staying here!

04:22.262 --> 04:24.965
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.806
Mom...

04:30.520 --> 04:32.097
Wait up!

04:37.444 --> 04:39.195
Watch your step.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.741
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

05:14.564 --> 05:18.064
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?

05:26.660 --> 05:29.703
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.747
Let's find out. It must be close.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.619
Houses, way out here?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.447
I knew it.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.621
It's an abandoned theme park.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.754
They built lots of them
back in the nineties.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.458
But they went bust when
the economy tanked.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.051
This must be one of them.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.137
Wait, where are we going?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.966
Let's go back, Dad.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.600
Please!

06:44.988 --> 06:48.112
Mom, that building's moaning.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.450
It's just the wind.

06:49.743 --> 06:54.449
What a lovely spot. We should've
brought the sandwiches.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.327
This would've been a river.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.464
Do you smell something?

07:07.010 --> 07:10.304
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.304
Maybe they're open for
business after all.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.100
Hurry up, Chihiro.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.395
Wait for me!

07:50.178 --> 07:51.846
This way.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.353
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.727
There's nobody here.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.693
Over there.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.029
Come on!

08:22.919 --> 08:24.746
Come take a look.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.425
This is amazing.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.469
Hello, is anybody here?

08:32.470 --> 08:35.092
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.557
You got customers!

08:41.354 --> 08:44.940
Don't worry. We'll pay
when they show up.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.609
You're right. Let's see now...

08:47.610 --> 08:49.938
What kind of bird is this?

08:51.448 --> 08:54.572
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.069
I don't want any.

08:56.077 --> 08:59.201
Can't we go? They'll be mad at us.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.583
Don't worry, your father's here.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.912
I've got credit cards and cash.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.589
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.304
- Mustard.
- Thanks.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.689
Mom! Dad!

10:37.804 --> 10:39.597
What a weird building.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.128
A train!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.591
You can't be here. Go now!

11:24.434 --> 11:27.604
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!

11:30.064 --> 11:32.316
They're lighting the
lamps. Come on!

11:32.317 --> 11:35.111
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!

11:49.125 --> 11:51.453
What's his problem?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.171
Dad?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.764
Dad, let's go home.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.683
Let's go, Dad!

12:32.252 --> 12:33.954
Dad!

12:34.254 --> 12:35.501
Mom!

12:44.764 --> 12:46.966
Mommy!

13:08.621 --> 13:10.038
Water!

13:23.219 --> 13:24.636
No...

13:24.637 --> 13:26.589
It's just a dream.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.469
Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

13:32.478 --> 13:34.476
Please wake up.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.238
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.321
Go away, disappear.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.113
Disappear.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.619
I'm fading away!

13:59.339 --> 14:01.883
This has to be a dream.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.975
Don't be afraid. I'm a friend.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.140
No, no, no!

14:59.357 --> 15:01.274
Open your mouth. Eat this.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.152
Unless you eat something from
this world, you'll disappear.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.650
No!

15:09.534 --> 15:12.744
Don't worry. You won't
turn into a pig.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.822
Chew it and swallow.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.800
Good, now you'll be fine.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.674
See for yourself.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.061
I can touch you.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.480
Of course. Now come.

15:40.481 --> 15:44.686
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.446
You can't see them
now, but you will.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.738
Quiet!

16:09.677 --> 16:13.097
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.892
I can't stand up. What should I do?

16:16.934 --> 16:20.934
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.

16:24.358 --> 16:28.813
In the name of the wind and
water within, unbind her.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.064
Stand up!

17:12.198 --> 17:15.321
Don't breathe while
we're on the bridge.

17:16.410 --> 17:21.707
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.338
I'm scared.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.048
Be calm.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.176
Welcome, your presence honors us.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.596
Greetings, welcome.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.095
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.053
Take a deep breath.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.312
Hold it.

18:01.122 --> 18:04.997
Welcome back. We've
been waiting for you.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.086
Just a little further.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.589
Master Haku!

18:11.132 --> 18:12.959
Where have you...

18:14.218 --> 18:16.170
A human?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.304
Run!

18:34.655 --> 18:37.073
Master Haku, Master Haku!

18:37.074 --> 18:39.826
I smell something.
A human intruder!

18:39.827 --> 18:42.203
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

18:42.204 --> 18:44.998
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.372
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.086
Now listen. I'll
tell you what to do.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.880
If you stay here, they'll find you.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.759
I'll distract them
while you get away.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.383
No, don't go! Stay with me, please.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.973
You have no choice, if you
want to survive here...

19:01.974 --> 19:03.892
and save your parents, too.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.520
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.143
Listen carefully.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.443
After I'm gone, go
through the back gate.

19:13.444 --> 19:16.488
Take the stairs all the way down.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.698
You'll find the
boiler room where...

19:18.699 --> 19:20.367
they stoke the fires.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.868
<i>Look for Kamaji.</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:25.364
Kamaji?

19:26.374 --> 19:28.750
Ask him for work.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.624
If he refuses, keep asking.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.628
If you don't work, Yubaba
will turn you into an animal.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.216
Yubaba?

19:36.217 --> 19:39.136
She's the sorceress
who rules our world.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.597
She'll try to trick
you into leaving...

19:42.598 --> 19:44.391
but keep asking for work.

19:44.517 --> 19:49.348
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.397
Master Haku, Master Haku!

19:53.484 --> 19:54.734
I have to go.

19:54.735 --> 19:59.156
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?

19:59.407 --> 20:01.655
You told me long ago.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.910
My name is Haku.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.623
Here I am!

20:10.334 --> 20:12.752
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.957
I know, I've been searching too.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.998
Um...

24:26.674 --> 24:28.217
Excuse me.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.391
Um...

24:42.898 --> 24:45.442
Are you Kamaji?

24:53.033 --> 24:56.908
Haku sent me. Please
let me work here.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.750
What, all at once?

25:05.212 --> 25:07.665
Get to work, you little runts!

25:09.049 --> 25:14.053
I am Kamaji, slave to the
boilers that heat the baths.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.427
Step on it, boys!

25:17.391 --> 25:19.600
Please let me work here.

25:19.601 --> 25:23.980
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.

25:23.981 --> 25:27.105
I'll never run out of help.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.533
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.298
Wait a second.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.636
Out of the way.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.942
Wait, what do I do with this?

27:04.456 --> 27:06.329
Do I leave it here?

27:06.500 --> 27:08.828
Finish what you start.

28:08.270 --> 28:12.231
Get to work, runts! Wanna
turn back into soot?

28:12.232 --> 28:16.068
And you, better watch it. You
can't just take someone's work.

28:16.069 --> 28:19.697
If they don't work, their
spell will be broken.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.027
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.462
You sootballs got a problem?

28:34.463 --> 28:36.165
Get to work!

28:37.007 --> 28:38.834
Chow time!

28:38.926 --> 28:41.549
What, you guys at it again?

28:43.263 --> 28:46.387
Give it a rest. Where's your bowl?

28:47.142 --> 28:49.344
I keep telling you to leave it out.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.143
Food's here. Break time!

29:07.537 --> 29:09.789
The human! You're gonna catch it.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.209
They're having a fit
about it upstairs.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.127
She's my granddaughter.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.796
Your granddaughter!

29:17.464 --> 29:21.300
She says she wants work,
but I don't need any help.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.971
Could you take her
to Yubaba for me?

29:24.972 --> 29:26.889
This girl can handle herself.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.433
Not a chance. Yubaba would kill me.

29:29.434 --> 29:34.435
Not even for this? Charcoal-roasted
newt, finest quality.

29:36.358 --> 29:40.444
If you want work, you have to
sign a contract with Yubaba.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.864
Might as well try your luck.

29:43.824 --> 29:46.868
Fine! You there, follow me.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.626
What about "Yes, ma'am"
or "Thank you"?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.128
Yes, ma'am.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.629
What a klutz. Move it!

29:58.630 --> 29:59.797
Yes, ma'am.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.386
Leave the shoes. And the socks!

30:05.387 --> 30:06.759
Yes'm.

30:11.935 --> 30:16.185
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.359
Thank you very much.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.188
Good luck.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.743
Yubaba lives on the top
floor in the back.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.601
Move it, will you?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.481
You'll lose your nose.

31:23.090 --> 31:26.009
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.639
We're here.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.345
Welcome, sir!

31:42.109 --> 31:46.735
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.884
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.565
Here we are.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.829
Your room is on the right.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.830
- Lin?
- Yes, sir!

32:43.170 --> 32:45.168
Something smells.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.923
It's human. You reek of human.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.467
Is that so?

32:49.509 --> 32:52.929
I smell it, I do. Smells
mighty tasty, too.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.928
You're hiding something.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.350
Tell me the truth.

32:58.351 --> 32:59.803
Maybe it's this.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.521
Roasted newt? Give it here!

33:02.522 --> 33:05.942
Not a chance. The girls
asked me to get it.

33:05.984 --> 33:09.188
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.

33:10.030 --> 33:13.200
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.548
Can't you even knock?

35:01.141 --> 35:04.311
What a plain little girl.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.564
Now, come.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.952
I said, come!

35:36.301 --> 35:38.674
Ow...

35:48.813 --> 35:51.892
What a racket. Could you be quiet?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.036
Please...

36:12.212 --> 36:14.540
Let me work here.

36:22.806 --> 36:26.016
Stop your babbling.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.517
Why do I need a weakling like you?

36:29.562 --> 36:34.017
Besides, this is no
place for humans.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.444
Millions of spirits come here...

36:37.445 --> 36:41.491
to purge themselves
of toil and care.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.536
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.

36:45.537 --> 36:49.248
Gobbling our guests' food
like a couple of pigs.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.577
Just deserts, I'd say.

36:51.918 --> 36:57.420
And as for you, you'll never
see your world again either.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.971
You'd make a lovely piglet.

37:04.097 --> 37:07.176
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

37:14.774 --> 37:16.483
Trembling, aren't you?

37:16.484 --> 37:20.237
Still, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.692
Someone must've helped you.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.993
I must thank your friend.

37:25.994 --> 37:30.825
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.294
Please let me work here!

37:35.295 --> 37:36.962
Not that again!

37:36.963 --> 37:38.585
I want to work here!

37:38.715 --> 37:43.842
Shut your mouth!

37:47.265 --> 37:51.185
Why on earth should I hire you?

37:51.186 --> 37:55.647
Anyone can see you're a lazy,
spoiled, stupid crybaby.

37:55.648 --> 38:00.778
What job would I possibly
have for someone like you?

38:00.779 --> 38:06.861
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.

38:07.577 --> 38:11.955
Or maybe I'll give you the
nastiest job I've got...

38:11.956 --> 38:14.124
and work you night and day...

38:14.125 --> 38:19.252
until you breathe your
very last breath!

38:31.601 --> 38:35.055
Now, now. What's wrong, my dear?

38:35.688 --> 38:38.562
I'm coming. That's a good baby.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.566
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.605
I want to work here!

38:43.696 --> 38:47.241
Keep your voice down.

38:47.242 --> 38:51.117
I'll be right there,
just be patient.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.624
That's a good baby. There, there.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.917
Please give me a job!

38:56.918 --> 38:59.917
All right, just pipe down.

39:00.046 --> 39:04.797
There, there, good baby.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.648
That's your contract.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.655
Sign on the bottom line.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.778
I'll put you to work.

39:32.245 --> 39:35.289
But one peep out of
you about anything...

39:35.290 --> 39:37.959
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.627
Should I sign here?

39:40.628 --> 39:44.332
Where else? Quit dilly-dallying.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.134
Unbelievable.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.475
What a ridiculous oath I took.

39:55.685 --> 39:59.480
I'm bound to give
work to whoever asks.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.606
- Finished?
- Yes.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.700
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.657
Quite a fancy name.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.874
From now on, your name is Sen.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.091
Understand? Sen.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.886
Answer me, Sen!

40:30.970 --> 40:32.429
I understand.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.847
Yes ma'am?

40:36.809 --> 40:41.264
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.140
What is your name?

40:43.983 --> 40:46.902
Chi... I mean, Sen.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.359
Then follow me, Sen.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.207
Haku, I...

40:59.332 --> 41:01.124
No idle chatter.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.669
Call me Master Haku.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.479
I'm afraid even Yubaba can't
give an order like that.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.353
Humans aren't allowed here.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.316
She signed the contract.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.736
- What!
- I'll work hard.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.490
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.993
She won't stink after
three days of our food.

41:35.994 --> 41:40.415
If she doesn't measure up,
do with her as you will.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.418
Now go back to work. Where's Lin?

41:44.419 --> 41:46.997
What, you're dumping her on me?

41:47.088 --> 41:48.714
You wanted an assistant.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.839
That's right! Lin's just perfect.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.260
Go, Sen.

41:53.261 --> 41:54.462
Yes sir.

41:55.054 --> 41:58.599
What a pain. You're
gonna pay for this.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.723
Off you go.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.392
Come on.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.733
You pulled it off!

42:15.158 --> 42:17.486
You're so thick, I was worried.

42:17.702 --> 42:21.577
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.996
What's wrong?

42:25.752 --> 42:28.000
My legs are shaking.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.586
This is where we live.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.964
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.844
Your apron. Keep it clean.

42:42.935 --> 42:44.227
Trousers.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.102
You're so puny.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.267
Too big.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.819
Lin, are there...

42:52.820 --> 42:53.945
What?

42:53.946 --> 42:56.198
Are there two Hakus here?

42:56.199 --> 42:59.903
Two of that one? I sure hope not.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.411
Still too big.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.365
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.958
Now where was that...

43:10.463 --> 43:12.836
All right, here we go.

43:13.966 --> 43:18.296
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.

43:18.971 --> 43:21.431
What's all the noise, Lin?

43:21.432 --> 43:24.055
New girl. Says she feels faint.

44:55.860 --> 45:00.315
Meet me at the bridge. I'll take
you to your mother and father.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.697
My shoes are gone.

45:59.799 --> 46:01.626
Thank you.

47:09.869 --> 47:11.537
Follow me.

47:54.372 --> 47:57.166
Dad, Mom, it's me!

47:57.500 --> 47:58.997
It's Sen.

47:59.502 --> 48:02.080
Mom! Dad!

48:05.007 --> 48:07.092
Are they sick? Are they hurt?

48:07.093 --> 48:10.012
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.

48:10.554 --> 48:13.678
They don't remember
they were ever human.

48:19.105 --> 48:21.648
Listen to me! I promise
I'll save you.

48:21.649 --> 48:25.023
Don't get too fat
or they'll eat you.

48:33.119 --> 48:34.912
Hide these.

48:37.623 --> 48:39.166
I thought they were gone.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.501
For when you go home.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.969
This was a farewell card.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.880
Chihiro?

48:53.097 --> 48:56.392
Chihiro... That's my name!

48:57.226 --> 48:59.895
Yubaba controls us by
stealing our names.

49:00.438 --> 49:04.734
You're Sen here. Keep
your real name a secret.

49:04.817 --> 49:08.146
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.

49:08.821 --> 49:12.241
Without your real name, you'll
never find your way home.

49:12.992 --> 49:15.660
I no longer remember mine.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.659
Your real name?

49:17.663 --> 49:21.208
But it's strange, I remember yours.

49:23.461 --> 49:26.255
Better eat, you must be hungry.

49:26.338 --> 49:27.915
I don't want to.

49:28.007 --> 49:32.303
I put a spell on them to
give you back your strength.

50:08.547 --> 50:11.375
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.

50:26.065 --> 50:27.482
You know the way back.

50:27.483 --> 50:30.357
Thanks Haku. I promise
to work hard.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.707
Where were you? I was worried.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.125
Sorry.

52:18.218 --> 52:20.261
Out of the way.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.353
Come on, give it some elbow grease.

52:35.653 --> 52:38.447
Starting today, you two
are on the big tub.

52:38.530 --> 52:40.657
What? That's Frog work!

52:40.658 --> 52:43.953
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.

53:03.847 --> 53:05.970
Aren't you getting wet?

53:09.895 --> 53:11.604
Sen, come on!

53:11.605 --> 53:13.064
Coming!

53:13.065 --> 53:14.983
I'll leave this open.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.888
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.682
Just look at this. Hasn't
been scrubbed in ages.

54:05.993 --> 54:09.328
The big tub is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

54:09.329 --> 54:11.202
It's caked with sludge.

54:11.290 --> 54:13.958
Lin! Sen! First
customers are coming.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.668
All right already!

54:15.669 --> 54:18.004
Man, this is pure harassment.

54:18.005 --> 54:21.257
Go get a tag from the foreman.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.550
A tag?

54:25.137 --> 54:27.214
For an herbal bath.

54:27.264 --> 54:28.716
Right.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.468
Lin, what's a foreman?

54:35.522 --> 54:38.521
Something's coming. I wonder...

54:47.326 --> 54:51.372
ls some good-for-nothing
using the rain to sneak in?

55:15.437 --> 55:18.140
Absolutely not, it's
too valuable to waste.

55:18.190 --> 55:20.063
Good morning!

55:20.317 --> 55:22.485
Feeling refreshed?

55:22.694 --> 55:23.986
For Kasuga.

55:23.987 --> 55:26.360
One deluxe sulfur bath.

55:26.532 --> 55:29.201
No point standing there.
Back to work.

55:29.368 --> 55:31.035
Scrub it with your hands.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.954
Good morning!

55:33.038 --> 55:34.121
Your bare hands.

55:34.122 --> 55:37.500
But she said it has
to be an herbal bath.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.252
You just don't get it.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.421
Mugwort, right?

55:41.547 --> 55:43.715
Relax and enjoy.

55:52.558 --> 55:55.432
Foreman. Yes ma'am!

55:57.312 --> 55:58.479
Thank you!

55:58.480 --> 55:59.806
But that's not...

55:59.815 --> 56:01.399
Hey you, wait!

56:01.400 --> 56:02.400
What's the trouble?

56:02.401 --> 56:04.023
Oh, nothing at all.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.903
We have an intruder.

56:05.904 --> 56:06.821
<i>A human?</i>

56:06.822 --> 56:10.026
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.

56:10.033 --> 56:12.535
Wow, you got a really good one.

56:12.536 --> 56:15.285
This goes straight to Kamaji.

56:16.665 --> 56:18.708
Water should be right up.

56:24.548 --> 56:27.672
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.

56:36.143 --> 56:38.644
You're really are a klutz.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.855
Look at that color.

56:40.856 --> 56:43.354
This one has dried worm salts.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.858
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

56:48.780 --> 56:51.824
Yank it again when
it's full. It'll stop.

56:52.075 --> 56:55.536
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.

56:55.537 --> 56:56.989
Okay.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.430
Ouch!

57:25.275 --> 57:28.149
Um... The bath's not ready yet.

57:33.492 --> 57:35.160
So many...

57:37.663 --> 57:39.786
They're for me?

57:42.709 --> 57:45.412
But I don't need them.

57:47.965 --> 57:49.917
No, you gave me one already.

58:04.648 --> 58:05.731
Madam!

58:05.732 --> 58:09.402
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.

58:09.403 --> 58:11.278
It's headed straight
for the bridge!

58:11.279 --> 58:13.857
Please turn back.

58:14.366 --> 58:17.866
Please go! The baths are
closed for the night.

58:17.911 --> 58:20.538
Please withdraw, please!

58:20.539 --> 58:23.367
Stinky!

58:23.375 --> 58:27.378
That's odd. Stink
Spirits feel different.

58:27.379 --> 58:30.128
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

58:30.632 --> 58:34.382
All we can do is get
rid of it fast.

58:34.761 --> 58:36.721
Everyone, please
return to your rooms!

58:36.722 --> 58:38.640
Please hurry. Terribly sorry!

58:40.392 --> 58:42.643
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

58:42.644 --> 58:43.640
Yes sir!

58:43.687 --> 58:46.397
Pay attention, this is your debut.

58:46.398 --> 58:49.397
Show the customer to the big tub.

58:50.193 --> 58:52.395
Remember, one peep out
of you and you're coal.

58:52.446 --> 58:55.570
- Got it?
- It has arrived.

59:05.667 --> 59:07.961
No, that's not polite!

59:15.802 --> 59:19.472
Welgum to our bazz.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.769
Oh... Money...!

59:24.770 --> 59:27.438
Hurry Sen, take it!

59:27.439 --> 59:28.891
Yez ma'am.

59:36.990 --> 59:41.702
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!

59:41.703 --> 59:43.655
Diz way...

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:03.846
Sen!

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.641
Horrible!

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:12.608
Breakfast!

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.903
Open the windows, all of 'em!

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.778
What? Just a minute.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:09.081
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.875
What will she do?

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:17.798
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:21.924
Oh dear, she's soiling the
walls with her dirty hands!

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.900
Did you give Sen new tags?

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:38.729
Never, what a waste!

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.647
All that precious herbal essence!

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:50.891
Sen! Sen, where are you?

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:53.269
- Lin!
- Are yo u okay?

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.144
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.775
He's sending his
best herbal essence.

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:02.319
Thanks. There's a thorn or
something stuck in him.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.445
A thorn?

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.273
I can't pull it out.

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:08.117
A thorn? Hmm...

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:11.161
Get everyone downstairs!

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:12.158
Hurry!

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.209
Sen and Lin!

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.788
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.382
Use this rope.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:24.675
Yes ma'am!

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:34.928
Tie it good and tight!

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:40.143
Hurry up! Girls, lend a hand!

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:42.148
It's tied!

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:46.655
Everyone ready? All together now!

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.655
Heave!

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.153
And heave!

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.580
Heave!

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.909
Heave!

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:05.671
A bicycle?

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:09.671
I knew it. Now, heave!

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:12.424
Heave!

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:46.625
Sen, are you all right?

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:59.600
Well done.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.135
Gold! It's gold!

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:33.846
Hands off! That's company property.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:37.517
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:46.316
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:49.020
Open the main gates! He's leaving!

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:19.885
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:23.103
That was the guardian
of a great river.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:24.977
Everyone, learn from Sen!

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:27.558
Sake on the house tonight.

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.733
Now hand over all
that gold you picked up.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.369
Want some? I swiped them.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.212
Thanks.

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:50.586
What a day.

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:54.426
Haku missed the whole thing.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.504
Not Haku again!

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:59.800
Sometimes he just disappears.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:03.936
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:04.895
Really?

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:06.396
Lights out, Lin.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:07.644
Okay.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:35.467
There's a town. And the
water's like an ocean.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.672
What did you expect
after all that rain?

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:44.511
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.336
What's wrong?

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.401
Gold!

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:47.163
Who are you? You're no customer.

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.117
You're not allowed in there.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.919
Hey, it's gold! For me?

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:06.559
You can make gold?

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.064
Gimme!

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.992
Who's down here?

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:26.404
It's way past lights out.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:33.167
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.377
Starved, in fact.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:35.379
That voice...

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.502
There, I'll pay you now.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:40.801
I'm a customer. I want a bath.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.629
Wake everyone up!

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:51.395
Mom and Dad, the river guardian
gave me this medicine.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:54.475
If you take it, you'll
be people again.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.605
Dad, Mom, where are you?

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.232
Daddy!

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.498
What an awful dream.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.292
Lin?

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.006
Where is everybody?

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:32.307
Wow, it really did
turn into an ocean!

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:40.562
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.158
Kamaji lit the fires already.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.282
Did I sleep that long?

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:54.875
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:59.081
Serve everything you've
got, even leftovers!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.882
Sen!

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.084
Lin?

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:06.045
I was just coming to
wake you up, look!

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.548
Gold! He gave me real gold.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.849
We've got a real high roller.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:13.428
Please, sir, try this!

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.184
Throw us some gold!

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:25.531
I'm starving, bring it all!

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:31.446
Who's this guest?

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:35.116
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:37.451
I'm going to see Kamaji.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:40.128
I wouldn't go there now.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:42.506
He's angry because
they woke him up.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.550
Lin, let's go back for more.

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:13.079
What if I can't
recognize my parents?

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:16.657
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:46.437
That's the dragon I saw.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.439
It's coming this way.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.493
Those aren't birds!

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:07.000
Haku, don't give up. Over here!

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:09.676
Haku!

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:30.235
It's just paper.

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.682
Haku? It is you, isn't it?

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:10.070
Are you hurt? Those
paper birds are gone.

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:11.568
You're safe now.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:26.495
He's going to Yubaba.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:29.548
What should I do? He'll die!

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:41.765
Now the richest man in
the whole wide world...

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:46.144
has come to grace us
with his presence.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.025
Greetings!

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:52.571
Now let us appeal
to his generosity.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.903
Please, sir! Over here.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.452
I hope I get some.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.655
They say gold springs
from his palms.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:05.580
Toss some this way, sir!

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.880
What are you doing?

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:11.965
Going upstairs.

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:14.214
No you don't. What's this?

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:16.171
Blood!

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.343
Out of the way, we have a guest.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.726
Thank you for your help.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.519
Get out of the way!

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:52.127
I don't need it.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:57.386
I'm busy, please excuse me.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.893
Quiet! Quiet down.

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:14.232
Back, get back!

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.696
Please excuse her manners.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:20.447
The girl is new and a human.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:25.581
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.166
Why, I would never...

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:34.457
He ate them!

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.629
Yubaba!

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:18.121
We're in a fine mess now.

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:20.797
He's a No Face.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.966
That's right, a No Face!

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:26.174
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:29.924
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.809
Just look at this carpet.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.186
Get Haku out of here.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:37.264
He's useless to me now.

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:02.840
Bo, sleeping outside
your crib again?

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:10.847
Oh I'm sorry, you were sleeping
like such a good baby.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:13.972
Baba still has work to do.

01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:19.686
Go back to sleep now,
that's a good baby.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.632
Ouch, let me go!

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:51.846
Oh, thanks for helping me.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:55.266
But I'm in a hurry,
please let me go.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.811
You came to make me sick.

01:20:58.145 --> 01:21:00.939
The outside has bad germs.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:05.687
I'm a human. Maybe you
never saw one before.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:08.154
You'll get sick out there.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.406
Stay here and play with me.

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:12.075
Are you sick?

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:15.036
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:17.622
Staying inside will make you sick!

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:21.501
You see, someone I really
care about is badly hurt.

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:23.252
I've got to go right now.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:24.830
Please let me go.

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:30.134
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.969
I'll break your little arm.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.262
You're hurting me!

01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:35.932
Please, I'll come
play with you later.

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:37.726
No, I wanna play now!

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:43.895
Blood! See? It's blood!

01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:56.987
Haku!

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.330
Go away!

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:00.623
It's you, isn't it?

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:02.167
Hang on!

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.501
Be quiet!

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:04.828
Haku!

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:11.593
Go away!

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:15.597
No!

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:34.407
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:36.451
Please be a good boy and wait.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.868
If you don't play
with me I'll cry...

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.166
Please, wait!

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:46.667
What a racket. Simmer down.

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:50.377
You're a little
butterball, aren't you?

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.349
I am a bit transparent here.

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:01.392
Baba...

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:05.977
Oh dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:16.991
There, that gives you a
little more freedom.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.492
Let's see now. What
shall we turn you into?

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:41.140
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:43.389
I'll do the same to you.

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.062
Who are you?

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:48.564
Yubaba's older twin sister.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:52.485
Thanks to you I've had
a nice tour of the place.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.654
Now hand over the dragon.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.274
What are you going to do?
He needs help.

01:23:57.407 --> 01:24:00.701
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:03.829
He stole a valuable
seal from my house.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:06.783
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:10.753
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid...

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:15.551
and eager to learn my
sister's magical ways.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:19.554
This boy will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:21.806
Now step aside.

01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:24.433
It's too late for him anyway.

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:27.687
The thing he stole had
a protection spell.

01:24:27.688 --> 01:24:30.016
Now the thief will die.

01:24:30.607 --> 01:24:32.480
No, don't!

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:41.909
What are you up to now?

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.784
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:54.502
Oh dear, that was careless...

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.383
Haku, no!

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:18.988
Haku!

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:48.517
What is this?

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:50.186
Hold on there!

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:54.436
Haku!

01:25:57.694 --> 01:25:59.487
Does it hurt?

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:05.236
This is serious.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.412
Haku, don't give up.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.411
What can we do? He'll die!

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:13.542
Something inside him
is eating him up.

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:14.752
Inside him?

01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:18.298
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.

01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:21.801
Haku, the river
guardian gave me this.

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:24.175
Eat it, maybe it will help.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:28.676
Haku, open your mouth.

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:31.519
Please Haku, eat it.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.061
See, it's safe.

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:37.442
Is it some kind of medicine?

01:26:37.484 --> 01:26:40.733
Open your mouth. You can do it.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.200
That's it.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.823
Swallow it.

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:07.589
He spit something out. That's it!

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:21.485
The seal!

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:23.529
It's getting away.
There! Over there!

01:27:43.049 --> 01:27:45.923
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:50.931
Begone!

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:53.931
Haku took this from
Yubaba's sister.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.934
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.

01:27:57.147 --> 01:27:59.475
Precious loot, I'd say.

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:03.903
I knew it was Haku.

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:05.697
Kamaji, it's Haku!

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:08.824
Haku!

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:10.527
Haku, Haku!

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:14.747
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:18.543
He is, but he's still
very ill from the spell.

01:28:27.594 --> 01:28:30.798
That should calm him some.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:38.020
Haku turned up one
day, just like you.

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:41.065
He said he wanted to learn magic.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.275
I tried to warn him.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:47.151
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice
is dangerous business.

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.070
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying...

01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:51.867
that he'd lost his home.

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:55.618
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.

01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:59.124
He got paler and paler
as time went by...

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:02.249
and got a sharp gleam in his eye.

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:08.217
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Zeniba.

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:12.054
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:14.178
Tell me how to get there.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:16.935
To Zeniba's house?

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:19.186
That's one scary sorceress.

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:20.183
Please.

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:24.435
Haku helped me. Now
I want to help him.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:29.238
Well, getting there is one thing.

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:31.362
Getting back's the problem.

01:29:31.491 --> 01:29:33.443
Wait a minute.

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:39.207
Let's see now, they're
here somewhere...

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:42.961
Everyone, I need my
shoes and clothes.

01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:54.298
Sen! I've been hunting
for you everywhere!

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:57.892
Lin...

01:29:57.893 --> 01:30:00.767
Haku? What happened here?

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:02.472
Who are those guys?

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:04.940
My new friends.

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:05.858
Right?

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:09.275
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.

01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:13.109
That big tipper turned
out to be a No Face.

01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:15.989
Yubaba says you let him in.

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:20.581
She might be right.

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:22.791
What, are you serious?

01:30:22.792 --> 01:30:24.543
I thought he was a customer.

01:30:24.544 --> 01:30:27.918
He's already swallowed
three of our people!

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:31.335
Found them. Here they are, Sen.

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:33.302
We're busy, gramps.

01:30:33.303 --> 01:30:35.096
You can use these.

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:39.224
Train tickets? Where'd
you get those?

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:41.810
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:45.766
You get off at the sixth
stop, called Swamp Bottom.

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:47.024
Swamp Bottom?

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:49.068
That's right, the sixth stop.

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:50.270
Six.

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:54.156
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train...

01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:56.158
but these days it's one way only.

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.952
Still want to go?

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:01.373
Yes, I'll walk back
along the tracks.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:04.750
What about Yubaba?

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:06.203
I'll talk to her now.

01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:10.836
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:13.130
What's going on here?

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:16.179
Don't you understand? It's love.

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:26.355
It just keeps getting bigger!

01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:29.184
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.

01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:38.117
Thank goodness, Sen!

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:40.537
Yubaba can't control him.

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:47.586
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:50.497
Where's Sen? I want Sen!

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.457
Now hurry!

01:31:57.595 --> 01:31:59.638
Yubaba, it's Sen.

01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:01.140
Where were you?

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:05.767
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:09.898
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!

01:32:09.899 --> 01:32:12.943
Win him over and take all his gold.

01:32:16.614 --> 01:32:19.158
What's this filthy rat?

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:23.363
Don't you recognize him?

01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:26.366
Of course not. How disgusting.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.951
Now in you go.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:31.705
Have a nice time.

01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:34.875
Will she be all right?

01:32:34.924 --> 01:32:36.967
Want to take her place?

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.654
Try this, it's yummy.

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:07.033
Want some gold? I've
decided it's just for you.

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:12.711
Come over here.

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:16.542
What do you want? You can tell me.

01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:18.717
Where did you come from?

01:33:18.718 --> 01:33:21.296
There's someplace I
have to go right away.

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:26.141
You should go home.

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:29.312
You can't give me what I want.

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:34.184
Where's your home? You
must have a mom and dad.

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:38.318
No... No...

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:43.027
I'm lonely... So lonely...

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.362
Are you lost?

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:49.287
Sen... I want Sen.

01:33:49.707 --> 01:33:51.033
Take the gold.

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:52.668
Would you eat me?

01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:53.585
Take it.

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:54.662
Take it!

01:34:03.721 --> 01:34:06.640
Before you eat me, eat this first.

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:11.271
I was saving it for my
parents, but you can have it.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:33.497
Sen!

01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:39.708
You little wench!
What did you feed me?

01:34:54.772 --> 01:34:56.315
Watch out!

01:34:57.275 --> 01:34:59.318
Not in my house!

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.162
I'm over here!

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:16.294
Here!

01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:02.711
You'll pay for this!

01:36:19.983 --> 01:36:22.231
Sen, down here!

01:36:38.376 --> 01:36:40.752
Over here!

01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:42.626
We don't need him.

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:50.053
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:52.347
But where do we take him?

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:53.432
I don't know.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:55.055
Don't know?

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:58.138
Great, now he's following us.

01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:17.664
- From here you walk.
- Okay.

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.541
You'll find the station.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:21.164
Thanks.

01:37:21.586 --> 01:37:23.413
Be sure to come back!

01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:24.622
I will.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:32.220
Sen! I said you were a klutz.

01:37:32.221 --> 01:37:33.923
I take it back!

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:46.315
No Face, hurt her and
you'll get it from me!

01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:50.948
There it is.

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:04.871
The train's coming, let's hurry.

01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:30.605
To Swamp Bottom, please.

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:38.867
You want to come too?

01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:42.366
One more, please.

01:39:22.707 --> 01:39:24.250
Sit down.

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:26.540
Behave yourself, okay?

01:41:28.499 --> 01:41:30.167
Kamaji.

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:35.046
Oh, Haku. You're awake.

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:36.794
Kamaji, where's Sen?

01:41:37.008 --> 01:41:39.802
What happened? Please tell me.

01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:42.923
Don't you remember anything?

01:41:43.306 --> 01:41:45.599
Just fragments.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.895
Chihiro kept calling my
name in the darkness.

01:41:48.978 --> 01:41:53.183
I followed her voice
and woke up here.

01:41:53.357 --> 01:41:58.438
Chihiro? So her name is Chihiro.

01:41:59.488 --> 01:42:02.567
Wonderful...
It's the power of love.

01:42:06.037 --> 01:42:09.247
This gold will hardly
cover the damage.

01:42:09.248 --> 01:42:12.372
That fool, Sen! She
just cost me a fortune.

01:42:12.668 --> 01:42:16.504
But we were saved, thanks to her.

01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:17.756
Silence!

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:20.300
She started the whole thing.

01:42:20.301 --> 01:42:22.719
Now she's run away.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.594
Abandoned her own parents!

01:42:26.057 --> 01:42:30.103
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

01:42:30.227 --> 01:42:32.054
No, wait.

01:42:33.022 --> 01:42:34.272
Master Haku!

01:42:34.273 --> 01:42:36.726
What, you're still alive?

01:42:38.903 --> 01:42:42.482
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.700
You've gotten pretty fresh.

01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:48.370
Since when do you talk that way?

01:43:39.797 --> 01:43:41.965
Bo?

01:43:47.763 --> 01:43:49.514
Bo!

01:43:49.515 --> 01:43:50.640
Pebbles!

01:43:50.641 --> 01:43:53.640
Bo!

01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:57.982
Where are you, Bo?

01:43:58.107 --> 01:44:00.935
Please come out.

01:44:01.444 --> 01:44:02.941
Bo!

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:08.488
Bo?

01:44:13.122 --> 01:44:17.668
Why, you little...

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:22.248
Out with it!

01:44:23.507 --> 01:44:27.837
Where did you hide my Bo?

01:44:28.137 --> 01:44:30.054
He's with Zeniba.

01:44:30.055 --> 01:44:32.223
Zeniba?

01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:56.831
Now I understand. That evil witch.

01:44:56.832 --> 01:44:59.751
She thinks she's beaten me.

01:45:01.212 --> 01:45:03.665
So, what's your plan?

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:06.174
I'll bring him back.

01:45:06.175 --> 01:45:10.553
But you must send Sen and her
parents back to their world.

01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:13.177
And what about you?

01:45:13.224 --> 01:45:17.179
Maybe I'll send them back and
then tear you to pieces.

01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:05.768
I think this is right.

01:46:06.735 --> 01:46:08.232
Come on.

01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:36.720
You can ride on my shoulder.

01:47:55.177 --> 01:47:56.799
Come in.

01:48:01.767 --> 01:48:03.765
Thank you.

01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:08.144
Well, hurry up then.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.937
Come on.

01:48:13.028 --> 01:48:14.988
So you all made it.

01:48:14.989 --> 01:48:17.532
- I...
- Have a seat.

01:48:17.533 --> 01:48:19.986
I'll make some tea.

01:48:25.624 --> 01:48:30.079
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.

01:48:33.132 --> 01:48:35.801
Do you know what this is?

01:48:35.884 --> 01:48:38.928
No, but I know it's very precious.

01:48:38.929 --> 01:48:42.759
I'm here to apologize
for him. He's sorry.

01:48:43.434 --> 01:48:46.602
You held this and nothing
happened to you?

01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:47.645
What?

01:48:47.646 --> 01:48:50.645
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

01:48:51.567 --> 01:48:54.861
I'm sorry. There was
this strange bug.

01:48:54.862 --> 01:48:56.905
I squashed it.

01:48:57.239 --> 01:48:59.567
Squashed it!

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:04.871
My sister snuck that
bug into the dragon...

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:07.665
so she could control him.

01:49:07.666 --> 01:49:10.494
And you squashed it!

01:49:13.088 --> 01:49:14.797
Now then, sit down.

01:49:14.798 --> 01:49:18.002
You must be No Face. You sit, too.

01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:22.555
Please turn them back
into themselves.

01:49:22.556 --> 01:49:25.767
Why my dear,
the spell's long broken.

01:49:25.768 --> 01:49:28.346
They can change back any time.

01:49:35.444 --> 01:49:39.405
Yubaba and I are two halves of a
whole, but we don't get along.

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:42.116
You know what bad taste she has.

01:49:42.117 --> 01:49:45.366
Sorceress twins are just
a recipe for trouble.

01:49:49.208 --> 01:49:53.795
I'd like to help you dear, but
there's nothing I can do.

01:49:53.796 --> 01:49:56.044
It's one of our rules here.

01:49:56.298 --> 01:49:59.425
You'll have to save your parents
and your dragon boyfriend...

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:01.177
all by yourself.

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:04.302
But can't you even give me a hint?

01:50:04.473 --> 01:50:08.101
I feel like Haku and I
met a long time ago.

01:50:08.102 --> 01:50:10.304
In that case it's easy.

01:50:10.395 --> 01:50:13.064
Everything that happens
stays inside you...

01:50:13.065 --> 01:50:15.518
even if you can't remember it.

01:50:16.652 --> 01:50:20.197
It's already late. Why
don't you stay the night?

01:50:20.405 --> 01:50:23.404
You boys give me a hand.

01:50:29.331 --> 01:50:31.533
Come on, keep at it.

01:50:34.336 --> 01:50:37.004
See? You have a talent for this.

01:50:37.005 --> 01:50:38.832
You're a big help.

01:50:39.424 --> 01:50:42.878
It's not the same
when you use magic.

01:50:44.012 --> 01:50:48.558
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.

01:50:48.559 --> 01:50:51.387
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

01:50:51.854 --> 01:50:55.523
Haku could die while
I'm sitting here.

01:50:55.524 --> 01:50:59.228
And they might eat my mom and dad!

01:51:01.196 --> 01:51:04.073
Wait just a little longer.

01:51:04.074 --> 01:51:05.821
There we are.

01:51:06.451 --> 01:51:08.619
Use it to tie back your hair.

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:14.701
It's pretty.

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:19.837
It'll protect you. I made
it from the thread we spun.

01:51:19.882 --> 01:51:21.379
Thank you.

01:51:30.726 --> 01:51:34.645
What good timing. We've got
another guest, let him in.

01:51:34.646 --> 01:51:35.972
Sure.

01:51:49.077 --> 01:51:50.403
Haku!

01:51:51.413 --> 01:51:52.785
Haku...

01:51:53.415 --> 01:51:55.208
I'm so glad to see you.

01:51:55.334 --> 01:51:58.003
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?

01:51:58.086 --> 01:51:59.287
Thank goodness.

01:52:00.923 --> 01:52:03.376
Good timing, I'd say.

01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:06.511
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

01:52:06.845 --> 01:52:11.098
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did.

01:52:11.099 --> 01:52:14.678
But be sure to protect this girl.

01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:17.897
Okay boys, time you went home.

01:52:17.898 --> 01:52:20.146
Come see me again soon.

01:52:20.692 --> 01:52:25.238
You stay with me and be my helper.

01:52:27.532 --> 01:52:28.699
Zeniba!

01:52:29.117 --> 01:52:31.410
Thank you, I'm going now.

01:52:31.411 --> 01:52:34.622
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

01:52:34.623 --> 01:52:37.959
My real name is Chihiro.

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:40.586
Chihiro? What a nice name.

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:42.588
Take good care of it.

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:43.381
I will!

01:52:43.382 --> 01:52:45.380
Now off you go.

01:52:46.885 --> 01:52:50.180
Thank you, Zeniba. Goodbye!

01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:40.723
Haku, listen.

01:53:40.856 --> 01:53:44.686
I don't remember this, but
my mom told me about it.

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:48.690
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.

01:53:48.947 --> 01:53:52.777
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.

01:53:52.951 --> 01:53:55.279
But I just remembered.

01:53:56.204 --> 01:53:58.077
The river was called...

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:01.619
it was called the Kohaku River.

01:54:02.044 --> 01:54:05.248
Your real name is Kohaku.

01:54:26.651 --> 01:54:28.235
Chihiro, thank you!

01:54:28.236 --> 01:54:31.690
My name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

01:54:31.907 --> 01:54:35.284
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:38.204
What a name! Sounds
like a guardian spirit.

01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:42.875
I remember how you fell
into me as a child.

01:54:42.876 --> 01:54:44.794
You were chasing your shoe.

01:54:44.795 --> 01:54:49.341
Yes, and you carried
me to shallow water.

01:54:50.008 --> 01:54:51.460
I'm so happy...

01:55:24.042 --> 01:55:25.664
They're back!

01:55:38.807 --> 01:55:41.635
You brought Bo back with you?

01:55:44.312 --> 01:55:45.354
Baba!

01:55:45.355 --> 01:55:49.981
Bo! You're not hurt? What
a terrible time you had.

01:55:51.027 --> 01:55:54.356
Bo, when did you learn
to stand on your own?

01:55:54.739 --> 01:55:56.862
Yubaba, remember your promise.

01:55:56.908 --> 01:56:00.112
Send Chihiro and her parents
back to their world.

01:56:00.328 --> 01:56:02.872
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:06.202
This world has rules, you know.

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:07.918
Silence!

01:56:07.919 --> 01:56:10.747
Just do it, Baba. Don't be so mean.

01:56:10.839 --> 01:56:13.633
Baby had such a good time.

01:56:13.925 --> 01:56:16.802
But I'm just following the rule.

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:19.381
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

01:56:19.431 --> 01:56:22.760
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

01:56:22.851 --> 01:56:24.310
But...

01:56:24.311 --> 01:56:25.683
Granny!

01:56:25.687 --> 01:56:27.264
Granny?

01:56:27.397 --> 01:56:29.224
I'll do as you ask.

01:56:40.869 --> 01:56:43.120
Haku told me about the rule.

01:56:43.121 --> 01:56:45.119
Well, you've got guts.

01:56:45.123 --> 01:56:48.542
I brought your contract. Follow me.

01:56:48.543 --> 01:56:50.791
This won't take a minute, Bo.

01:56:51.588 --> 01:56:53.290
Don't worry.

01:56:57.552 --> 01:57:01.598
See if you can pick out
your parents for me.

01:57:10.732 --> 01:57:12.274
You get one guess.

01:57:12.275 --> 01:57:15.149
Pick them out and you all go free.

01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:30.626
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.

01:57:30.627 --> 01:57:34.422
Not here? Is that your answer?

01:57:35.757 --> 01:57:37.004
Yes.

01:57:39.594 --> 01:57:43.055
You're right!

01:57:43.056 --> 01:57:45.725
Attagirl! Good for you.

01:57:49.479 --> 01:57:50.771
Thank you everyone.

01:57:50.772 --> 01:57:54.226
All right! You win,
just get out of here.

01:57:54.526 --> 01:57:56.649
Thanks for everything.

01:57:56.987 --> 01:57:58.689
Goodbye.

01:57:58.947 --> 01:58:00.114
Thank you.

01:58:00.115 --> 01:58:01.692
See you soon.

01:58:01.783 --> 01:58:03.735
- Haku!
- Let's go.

01:58:04.202 --> 01:58:05.536
Where's Mom and Dad?

01:58:05.537 --> 01:58:07.034
They went on ahead.

01:58:14.379 --> 01:58:15.629
The water's gone.

01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:17.582
I can't go any further.

01:58:17.799 --> 01:58:20.301
Go back the way you came.

01:58:20.302 --> 01:58:23.554
But don't look back until
you're out of the tunnel.

01:58:23.555 --> 01:58:25.849
But what about you?

01:58:26.057 --> 01:58:28.976
I'll tell Yubaba I'm
quitting my apprenticeship.

01:58:28.977 --> 01:58:31.726
I'm fine now. I have my name back.

01:58:32.063 --> 01:58:33.981
Now I can go home too.

01:58:33.982 --> 01:58:35.482
Will we meet again somewhere?

01:58:35.483 --> 01:58:37.109
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?

01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:38.068
Promise.

01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:40.567
Now go, and don't look back.

01:59:03.428 --> 01:59:05.221
Chihiro!

01:59:05.347 --> 01:59:08.221
Where have you been? Hurry up.

01:59:11.519 --> 01:59:13.479
Mom! Dad!

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.356
Don't go running off like that.

01:59:15.357 --> 01:59:16.558
Let's go.

01:59:17.025 --> 01:59:19.360
Mom, are you really okay?

01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:23.816
Hurry, the moving
van will be there.

01:59:33.041 --> 01:59:35.460
Hurry up, Chihiro.

01:59:43.968 --> 01:59:45.844
Watch your step.

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:49.390
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

02:00:01.403 --> 02:00:03.071
The end of the tunnel.

02:00:03.238 --> 02:00:04.690
Hey!

02:00:04.823 --> 02:00:06.400
What is it?

02:00:06.783 --> 02:00:09.111
Will you look at that.

02:00:09.994 --> 02:00:12.367
It's all dusty inside, too.

02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:14.623
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...

02:00:14.624 --> 02:00:17.247
I told you not to stop here.

02:00:22.757 --> 02:00:25.460
That's it, you're fine.

02:00:26.511 --> 02:00:28.887
We're off, Chihiro.

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:31.807
Chihiro! Hurry up!

02:00:56.916 --> 02:00:58.709
Voices
