on us working side by side.

She never really said so,
but I could tell.

01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:34.681
You always refer to your mom

Only since we started
working at the Dunes,

01:17:36.557 --> 01:17:39.789
because she said that me calling
her "mom" made her feel old.

01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:46.983
She used to talk
about you a lot, you know.

01:17:48.234 --> 01:17:50.945

ever miss her?

Well, she could not
sing at all. [Chuckles]

when she would,

01:17:59.493 --> 01:18:02.725
and she would always sing
the same song over and over...

01:18:02.517 --> 01:18:04.811
like a broken record.

01:18:04.706 --> 01:18:08.042
