WEBVTT

00:22.756 --> 00:24.390
[Harley] This is bullshit!

00:24.457 --> 00:26.425
-This is a kangaroo court.
-[Two-Face] No way.

00:26.492 --> 00:28.361
We got a real judge
and everything.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.129
Hey, Judge, get in here.

00:30.196 --> 00:33.066
[Bane] All rise for me.

00:33.133 --> 00:36.469
-Bane's the judge?
-I promise you'll get
a fair shake.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.737
I am unbiased.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.807
Well, he's actually telling
the truth,

00:39.874 --> 00:42.442
which is really annoying,
so I took it upon myself

00:42.509 --> 00:45.646
to provide you
with Gotham's top litigator.

00:46.746 --> 00:49.415
[grunting]

00:49.482 --> 00:53.219
-Oh, we're so fucked.
-Let's not judge a lawyer
by the fact he's a bat.

00:53.286 --> 00:57.658
The defendants are charged with
the murder of Oswald Cobblepot

00:57.725 --> 01:00.259
and [mumbles] other stuff.

01:00.326 --> 01:01.829
Counselor Man-Bat.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.364
How do your clients plead?

01:06.733 --> 01:07.867
[clears throat]

01:07.935 --> 01:10.737
[shrieking]

01:10.737 --> 01:11.737
Yeah, we're fucked.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.376
[theme music playing]

01:18.679 --> 01:20.813
And then, she bit
The Penguin's nose off.

01:20.881 --> 01:25.451
-[all gasping]
-She bit The Penguin's
nose off.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.819
Mm, mm, mm.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.856
Is Harley Quinn
who definitely did that

01:29.924 --> 01:31.558
in the courtroom today?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.260
Yeah, that's Harley Quinn.

01:33.325 --> 01:36.530
-[shrieking]
-Does anyone speak bat?

01:36.596 --> 01:38.564
I want to sustain or overrule,

01:38.632 --> 01:40.500
but it's indecipherable.

01:40.566 --> 01:43.469
For my last witness,
I call...

01:43.537 --> 01:44.905
Poison Ivy!

01:44.905 --> 01:46.373
-[all gasping]
-[Two-Face laughs menacingly]

01:46.373 --> 01:48.375
Ooh, and they're friends.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.543
This is going to be saucy.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.200
[chuckles] Yeah.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.846
Ive, blame it all on me, okay?
You had my back

01:53.914 --> 01:56.582
no matter what stupid messes
I've gotten myself into.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.453
For once, let me be the one
who does something for you.

01:59.519 --> 02:00.921
You have a whole life
ahead of you,

02:00.921 --> 02:02.923
-I mean, you're engaged.
-But you and I are a team.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.325
Ive, please, I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

02:05.325 --> 02:06.393
if you went down for me.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.764
You hate people,
is that correct?

02:10.830 --> 02:13.633
-Yes.
-But you don't hate
Harley Quinn, do you?

02:13.699 --> 02:16.770
You partnered with her,
your only friend

02:16.836 --> 02:19.372
and helped her plan and execute

02:19.372 --> 02:21.574
the murder of
the Injustice League.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.276
[all murmuring]

02:26.580 --> 02:28.615
Yeah, we did it, okay?

02:28.681 --> 02:31.217
We teamed up
to kill your pathetic asses,

02:31.283 --> 02:34.554
'cause you deserved it
and one day,
we're gonna finish the job.

02:34.621 --> 02:35.656
-[all gasping]
-Ivy!

02:35.722 --> 02:37.591
[all clamoring]

02:37.657 --> 02:39.725
Your Honor,
given the testimony,

02:39.793 --> 02:41.728
I request that you find
the defendants

02:41.794 --> 02:43.663
guilty on all counts!

02:43.729 --> 02:46.299
-[all gasping]
-[shrieking]

02:46.366 --> 02:51.366
I hereby sentence them to life!

02:52.338 --> 02:53.639
In prison, of course.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.710
[all gasping]

02:56.776 --> 02:58.912
What the hell
are we doing in the sewer?

02:58.979 --> 03:00.681
Smells like shit down here.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.883
Wait. [sniffs] That's me.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.985
My God, I told you three times.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.651
We need to stop Ratcatcher,

03:06.651 --> 03:08.754
he's using the tunnels
to move weapons across Gotham.

03:08.754 --> 03:10.205
Ratcatcher, right.

03:10.205 --> 03:13.225
Living underground,
these criminals have
hit rock bottom.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.995
-[metal clangs]
-[exclaiming]

03:15.062 --> 03:17.296
-Gordon, are you drunk?
-I have a high tolerance.

03:17.296 --> 03:20.300
And I have a low tolerance
for evasive answers.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.902
[mockingly] "I have
a low tolerance
for evasive answers."

03:22.969 --> 03:24.837
I know what I'm doing,
all right?

03:24.905 --> 03:27.340
I was putting away scum
while you were filling up

03:27.340 --> 03:29.575
your bat diaper
with stinky bat doodies.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.544
[Ratcatcher mumbling]

03:31.611 --> 03:34.381
-[rats squeaking]
-[moaning]

03:34.448 --> 03:36.248
I've seen this stuff on
the dark web.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.985
[sighs] Okay,
I'll circle around
and block the exit.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.920
Wait for my signal.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.855
[mutters] Taking orders
from a cheerleader.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.891
[sighs] I used to be
a damn good cop.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.030
Oh! Aah!

03:50.097 --> 03:51.097
-[rats squeaking]
-Huh?

03:52.866 --> 03:57.304
Swarm, my children! Swarm!

03:57.370 --> 03:59.438
[laughing maniacally]

03:59.506 --> 04:01.307
[screaming] Oh, shit!

04:01.373 --> 04:04.645
Shit, shit, shit! [gasps]

04:05.913 --> 04:08.748
[exclaims] Get it off!
[screams]

04:08.816 --> 04:10.417
-[Batgirl] Oh, come on.
-Thanks.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.752
-[thuds]
-[rat squeaks]

04:11.818 --> 04:13.453
[grunting]

04:15.055 --> 04:17.454
That's not mine.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.862
Why the hell
did you do that, Ive?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.730
Harls, I'm not gonna
let you rot in prison

04:24.730 --> 04:26.834
while I'm kiting around
the world on my honeymoon.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.601
But no one even knows
you're kidnapped,

04:28.668 --> 04:29.903
you could've led the rescue.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.571
Maybe called it a mini-moon.

04:31.637 --> 04:33.940
Come on, we can break out
of Arkham in our sleep.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.408
[tires screeching]

04:38.644 --> 04:40.447
Uh, the hell is this?

04:40.514 --> 04:42.230
[Bane] Your new home.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.416
-What the shit
are you doing here?
-I'm not just a judge.

04:44.483 --> 04:46.552
I am also a warden.

04:46.620 --> 04:51.091
Welcome to
he Pena Duro North Correctional
and Rehabilitation facility.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.927
Affectionately known as
The Pit.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.863
Listen, Bane, we're not going
in your dumb hole.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.732
So either free us or kill us.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.966
[Bane] Okay.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.735
[both screaming]

05:02.601 --> 05:05.338
[Poison Ivy] Oh, shit!

05:05.404 --> 05:06.773
Oh, they'll be fine.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.875
I set up padding at the bottom.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.677
Just more dramatic, you know,
to see 'em drop like that.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.480
[exclaims]

05:14.548 --> 05:16.516
While I was born in darkness,

05:16.583 --> 05:20.721
here at Pena Duro North,
we're bringing people
into the light.

05:20.786 --> 05:25.358
We try to cultivate
positive thinking in The Pit.

05:25.425 --> 05:30.362
Teach our guests to redirect
aggressive energies
like maiming and killing

05:30.430 --> 05:32.399
into something
more productive.

05:32.464 --> 05:34.867
Holy crap, is that Killer Croc?

05:34.867 --> 05:36.136
See for yourself.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.971
-Waylon.
-Oh, hey, Harley, Ivy.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.108
I was working on
a new water color.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.543
I call this one
"Reed in the Water."

05:43.610 --> 05:45.478
His name is Reed and, uh...

05:45.545 --> 05:47.915
He's in the water,
yeah, we get it.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.548
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

05:49.615 --> 05:51.050
I'm working out my shit.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.386
[Bane]
There's a talent show tomorrow

05:53.452 --> 05:55.988
to showcase what everyone's
been working on.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.091
I'd like you both
to participate.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.692
-She'll never do it.
-I won't do it.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.528
Here we are, home sweet home.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.730
You're probably wondering
to yourself,

06:04.798 --> 06:06.899
"Hey, Bane, why no door?"

06:06.966 --> 06:09.468
Because where
would you escape to?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.072
You are in a pit!

06:12.906 --> 06:14.108
[clicking tongue]

06:14.173 --> 06:16.910
Oh, my, who caused
this catastrophe?

06:16.976 --> 06:19.779
In The Pit, your bed
must be made daily.

06:19.846 --> 06:23.182
A tidy room is the key
to a tidy mind.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.886
Now, bring it in,
bring it in, my darlings.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.620
-Don't fucking touch me.
-I will murder you.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.855
I will see you two
in painting class.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.822
Winking, I'm winking.

06:31.822 --> 06:34.427
Shit, Harls, I mean,
how the hell are we gonna
get out of here?

06:34.494 --> 06:37.596
-I don't know, beanstalk us up.
-There's no plants!
There's no plants in sight.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.033
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
[sighs] we're gonna be
stuck in here forever.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.790
I mean, who's gonna protect
the rainforest?

06:41.790 --> 06:43.670
-Swamp Thing.
-Who'll defend
the Great Barrier Reef?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.973
-Aquaman.
-Who's gonna write letters
to the network

06:46.040 --> 06:47.940
when they're trying to decide
whether they should renew
<i>Love It or List It?</i>

06:48.007 --> 06:50.978
-Some loser.
-Yeah, exactly, and Kite Man...

06:50.978 --> 06:52.745
What about Kite Man?
I finally find somebody

06:52.812 --> 06:54.480
that I actually want to marry

06:54.548 --> 06:55.848
and now I can't even do it.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.117
-Fuck!
-Listen, we're gonna escape

06:58.117 --> 06:59.786
and you are gonna walk down
that aisle.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.221
You're right.
[exhales] You're right.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.288
We're gonna get out of here.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.891
-Hey, girls.
-Oh, shit.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.192
Just dropping off
some welcome caps I've knitted.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.810
It gets mighty chilly at night.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.000
Oh, pass the mayo.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.036
So, how'd
the crime fighting go?

07:16.103 --> 07:17.904
Eh, it's not working out
with Batgirl.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.805
She just doesn't have
what it takes,

07:19.872 --> 07:22.541
I might have to fly solo.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.577
[sighs] Dad, we need
to talk about your drinking.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.146
Ah, it's great, loosens me up.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.947
Um, [sighs], okay,

07:28.014 --> 07:30.483
this is super hard for me,
so I'm just gonna say it.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.685
You are a problematic drinker.

07:32.752 --> 07:35.822
A problematic drinker
and former cop
turned vigilante.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.125
A person can be two things,
or did you not know that?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.892
Trust me, Dad, I know.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.062
Right now, I'm telling you
you need to clean yourself up.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.663
Gotham needs you at your best.

07:44.663 --> 07:45.865
I'm at my best.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.267
Always have been,
always will be.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.069
If you won't stop drinking
for Gotham,

07:49.136 --> 07:50.502
do it for me.

07:50.569 --> 07:52.105
It hurts me to see you
like this.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.040
[gulps] Ah.
Oh, Barbara.

07:54.108 --> 07:55.809
[gunshots]

07:55.875 --> 07:57.778
-Get down!
-Oh, crap!

07:59.579 --> 08:02.983
Hey, Gordo, I heard you've been
playing cop again.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.517
Trying to move in
on my weapons sales.

08:05.584 --> 08:08.254
Dent. Ratcatcher's
working for you?

08:08.322 --> 08:11.125
The whole city works for me,
hadn't you heard?

08:11.125 --> 08:14.093
New New Gotham is mine.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.165
Ah, you wanna play rough?

08:18.165 --> 08:21.701
I should've killed you back
at the station months ago.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.170
And tonight, I fix my mistake.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.305
Barbara, we need to...

08:26.273 --> 08:27.774
Barbara?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.212
I would watch the light
leave their eyes

08:33.279 --> 08:36.883
and know that
their last thought was fear.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.220
But now I imagine myself
in the bubble of calm

08:40.287 --> 08:42.990
and the urge to kill goes away.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.758
[all clapping]

08:46.826 --> 08:49.196
-Why aren't you clapping?
-Because this is stupid.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.798
Look, Bane, we wanna change.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.734
We really do,
but it's just too...

08:54.801 --> 08:58.904
depressing in this very dark,
dank pit.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.908
I don't know, maybe
if you transfer us to Arkham...

09:01.975 --> 09:06.046
[laughs] Arkham is for
the criminally insane.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.948
The Pit is for
the criminally capable.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.899
[groaning]

09:10.899 --> 09:15.054
But I will let you in on
a little secret to lift
your spirits.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.192
Tomorrow's talent show
will have a special guest.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.793
Mr. George Lopez.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.296
Can you believe it?

09:22.363 --> 09:25.331
Yeah, he's choppering down
for a ten-minute set.

09:25.399 --> 09:29.068
Mostly new material,
but probably some old hits.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.336
Okay, this is how we escape.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.038
I sign up
for the talent show...

09:32.038 --> 09:34.006
-Lopez choppers in.
-We watch his hilarious set.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.243
That pokes fun at
the idiosyncrasies
of a Latino family.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.610
Then I do a tight five
that incites a prison riot.

09:38.677 --> 09:40.947
Which pulls the guards away
from the chopper...

09:41.014 --> 09:43.615
Wait, sorry, how is
standup comedy
gonna incite a riot?

09:43.615 --> 09:45.385
I tell a bunch of jokes
that piss people off.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.721
-Nice.
-Right? You and me
are getting on that chopper.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.255
We fly out
and you're exchanging "I dos"

09:49.255 --> 09:52.125
-with Kite Man in no time.
-[both whooping]

09:52.192 --> 09:53.960
[Two-Face] Where are
ya hiding, Gordon?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.263
Let's end this
real nice and quick.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.999
I got a dental appointment
in the early a.m.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.268
Lot of gum work, you know?

10:01.335 --> 10:02.836
Do you hear me, Gordon?

10:02.903 --> 10:05.705
I took your station,
I took your city,

10:05.772 --> 10:10.121
and now I'm taking your life.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.179
[Gordon] Oh.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.850
[sighs] I'm sorry.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.052
Let's get this over with,
Harvey.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.089
Glad you came to your senses.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.856
Better to go out like a man

10:23.923 --> 10:26.192
rather than begging like
one of those cats

10:26.259 --> 10:27.894
that thinks it's a dog.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.897
-Any last words?
-Tell my daughter...

10:30.964 --> 10:35.764
-I love her.
-Tell her yourself.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.273
[grunts]

10:41.807 --> 10:43.409
[screams]

10:43.476 --> 10:45.144
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

10:46.279 --> 10:48.715
You and the bat hussy
set me up.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.350
I only brought two goons.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.952
I thought this was gonna be
a two-goon job.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.855
That's on me.
I'll be back.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.423
-Why the hell did you do that?
-What?

10:56.490 --> 10:58.292
What'd you save me for?

10:58.359 --> 10:59.893
You know what I am?
I'm dead weight,
yesterday's news.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.061
Dime store sushi.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.328
I'll just get in
your way again.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.063
Hey. Hey!

11:04.130 --> 11:05.966
Ah, there was a swig
and a half left.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.801
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.135
Why?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.836
You don't need me,
Gotham doesn't need me.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.206
My own daughter thinks
I'm a joke.

11:12.206 --> 11:13.840
That's not true.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.309
You're a good man, Jim Gordon.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.977
-You inspired me.
-Ha!

11:17.977 --> 11:19.846
Oh, yeah?
Says the girl with bat ears.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.347
Batman's your inspiration.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.384
He inspired my costume.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.220
My dad inspired me.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.322
-Barbara?
-That's right.

11:28.389 --> 11:30.123
I'm Batgirl, Dad.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.326
You're the one that's been
protecting Gotham.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.831
That's my girl.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.966
And Killer Croc, he's so ugly.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.769
-How ugly is he?
-He's so ugly that
when I met him,

11:43.836 --> 11:45.839
I thought his asshole
was doing the talking.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.307
-[laughs]
-Hey-oh!

11:47.307 --> 11:49.009
Kind of feels like
a low hanging fruit there, but,

11:49.009 --> 11:50.408
it'll probably kill
with these dumb shits.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.879
Harley, I see that
you're doing stand up

11:52.946 --> 11:54.947
after Lopez. [laughing]

11:55.014 --> 11:57.116
Whoa, what is this?

11:57.183 --> 11:58.851
You failed to make your bed.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.421
Oh, shit, yeah,
sorry about that.

12:00.486 --> 12:04.191
Sorry doesn't cut it,
I was very clear on the rules.

12:04.258 --> 12:06.125
I cannot play favorites.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.995
Harley may not participate
in the talent show.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.298
I'll make my bed,
you weirdo. God.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.469
I wish your wave of enthusiasm
had crested earlier.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.304
-Ivy, you have to do my set.
-What? No.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.206
I can't tell jokes
in front of strangers.

12:20.274 --> 12:22.509
Yes, you can, you'll be a riot.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.345
A riot, I need you
to start a...

12:25.412 --> 12:27.480
-Stop, yes, I got it.
-Do it, Ivy.

12:27.548 --> 12:31.183
I guess I'm going up
after Lopez.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.385
[Bane] Bold.

12:34.288 --> 12:35.822
[grunts]

12:35.889 --> 12:37.490
This is gonna be easy
to break out of.

12:37.557 --> 12:42.557
-There is no door.
-[Bane] But there is a Cheryl.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.166
Ugh, hi, Cheryl,
you're really gonna make me
kill you to escape?

12:46.232 --> 12:48.100
Well, you can try.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.937
[grunting] I'm Cheryl.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.539
-[sighs]
-[growls]

12:53.606 --> 12:55.041
If she attempts to escape,

12:55.107 --> 12:58.110
force her to join
the show choir!

12:58.177 --> 13:00.313
[Bane laughing maniacally]

13:00.379 --> 13:01.847
[mic squealing]

13:01.914 --> 13:03.883
-Hello. Ah!
-[mic squealing loudly]

13:03.950 --> 13:06.285
And welcome to
the first annual

13:06.352 --> 13:09.054
Live from The Pit talent show.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.124
We have a lot of
great acts tonight,

13:11.191 --> 13:15.328
but first, who wants to see
some close-up magic?

13:17.431 --> 13:20.966
And then I said,
"From now on,
we're home schooling you."

13:20.966 --> 13:22.602
-[audience laughing]
-So whatever we don't know,

13:22.602 --> 13:24.381
-you don't know.
-[all laughing]

13:24.381 --> 13:26.539
Like, when did
the Korean War start?
I don't know.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.109
-And neither do you.
-[all laughing]

13:30.376 --> 13:32.379
[laughs heartily]

13:32.446 --> 13:33.879
Okay, that's my time.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.948
Thank you, The Pit.
Good night.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.317
[all cheering]

13:37.384 --> 13:40.287
Shit. This plan is so stupid.

13:43.591 --> 13:45.091
You've got this, Ivy.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.159
Cheryl, listen,
I'm getting past you,

13:47.226 --> 13:49.495
so either I do
and you're alive,
or I do and you're not.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.897
What do you say?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.399
[growls]

13:53.466 --> 13:55.369
Oh, Jesus. [gasps]

13:58.105 --> 14:00.441
Uh... Hello.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.378
Uh, I see Killer Croc is here.

14:04.445 --> 14:06.480
He's so ugly, when we met,

14:06.547 --> 14:08.514
I thought his asshole
was talking to me.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.484
Oh, come on,
it's a skin condition.

14:10.551 --> 14:12.052
Ah, that's below the belt.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.419
How about Victor Zsasz, okay?

14:13.419 --> 14:14.988
Oh, boy, here we go.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.456
The tally marks on his head

14:16.456 --> 14:18.057
make him look like
a <i>Peanuts</i> character.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.592
Oh [sighs], she's no Lopez.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.260
Hey, you just got Ivy'd.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.929
-[man] You suck!
-I know, right? I suck.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.932
Blah! Do you guys wanna riot?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.934
Why? This is a safe space.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.138
[helicopter whirring]

14:31.203 --> 14:32.505
Come on, Zsasz,
you're not even

14:32.505 --> 14:34.341
like a little pissed off
about that?

14:34.408 --> 14:36.243
You just got Ivy'd. Bleh.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.511
[laughs] Just start shanking,
people.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.548
-People, shank.
-If I could make
a constructive criticism.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.049
Your joke directed at me
was reference-heavy,

14:44.116 --> 14:45.951
and if might, a bit derivative.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.455
What the shit is this?
This should not be hard,

14:48.522 --> 14:50.691
you guys are killers,
kill each other.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.591
[grunts]

14:57.029 --> 14:58.529
[grunting]

15:06.206 --> 15:07.341
[metal clangs]

15:10.210 --> 15:13.279
[grunting]
I'm getting to that chopper!

15:15.182 --> 15:16.716
-Shit!
-Shit.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.686
Good night, The Pit.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.419
What a bunch of <i>locos.</i>

15:20.486 --> 15:22.087
[Barbara]
And after I defeated Riddler,

15:22.087 --> 15:25.057
-I knew what I had to do.
-I can't believe it.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.493
I... You were her!

15:26.559 --> 15:28.595
And she was you
while I was me.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.062
[laughs] Yeah,
I even slipped up

15:30.129 --> 15:31.398
and called you Dad
a few times.

15:31.465 --> 15:34.315
But you were pretty...
[sighs] Drunk.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.405
Dad, stop.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.740
Are you gonna lend a hand

15:40.807 --> 15:43.143
or is Batgirl too cool
to help her dad

15:43.210 --> 15:45.678
in a montage where we skip past
the hard parts

15:45.745 --> 15:47.279
of beating
an alcohol addiction

15:47.279 --> 15:48.749
and cut to the part
where I'm clean?

15:48.816 --> 15:50.916
Get over here.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.322
Welcome back, Dad.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.090
You're finally home.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.259
No, there's only one place
that's home.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.729
The Gotham City
Police Department.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.563
But that's Two-Face's lair.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.164
I'm taking it back.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.533
-Wanna know why?
-Why?

16:06.600 --> 16:10.200
'Cause I'm a damn good cop.

16:25.619 --> 16:29.154
So, um, I actually came
on stage to start a riot.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.024
-Huh?
-[Bane] What?

16:31.091 --> 16:33.259
I was gonna use the riot
as a diversion to escape

16:33.326 --> 16:35.629
on George Lopez's helicopter.

16:35.696 --> 16:38.532
Now that I say it out loud,
I realize how stupid it sounds.

16:38.599 --> 16:40.133
-[sighs]
-[all laughing]

16:40.133 --> 16:41.735
I mean, I'm never getting
out of here, right?

16:41.735 --> 16:44.104
[all laughing]

16:44.171 --> 16:47.573
My entire life I've been
cut off from my feelings,
you know?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.610
I was living in
an emotional pit,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.046
but I liked it that way,
you know.

16:53.046 --> 16:57.149
'Cause it was safe and secure,
and no one ever put a knit hat
on me, you know?

16:57.216 --> 16:59.352
-[all laughing]
-[Ivy chuckling]

16:59.418 --> 17:03.490
I guess that I accepted that
being lonely was, you know,
was my thing.

17:03.557 --> 17:05.192
And then something happened.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.228
I made friends,
I got engaged.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.431
-[all cheering]
-Thank you. I joined
the mile high Kite club.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.567
-[all whooping]
-Yeah, yeah.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.434
I'm going to give you
a piece of advice about sex
at 10,000 feet.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.670
Don't do it into the wind.

17:16.737 --> 17:18.104
[all laughing]

17:18.171 --> 17:19.405
And I was thinking about it,

17:19.405 --> 17:21.709
I'm like, was I happy?

17:21.775 --> 17:23.509
I was really happy.

17:23.509 --> 17:26.579
You know, it's like,
I crawled out of
my emotional pit.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.280
-[all exclaiming]
-[man] Yeah.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.250
And so then, what happens?

17:30.317 --> 17:32.486
-Where did the universe put me?
-[man] The Pit.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.121
-[all laughing]
-That's right, The Pit.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.089
And no matter how much
we change down here.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.459
No matter how many times
we make our goddamn bed

17:39.526 --> 17:41.327
or pass the talking stick.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.130
We're still stuck in this Pit.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.433
-And with Bane of all people.
-[all laughing]

17:47.500 --> 17:48.736
This guy.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.605
[laughing] I relate.

17:51.672 --> 17:53.539
Wow, she's got
a great point there.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.343
I did all this hard work
to get myself out of one pit

17:56.410 --> 17:58.511
just to end up in another.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.881
Life's just one big pit

18:00.948 --> 18:03.482
that none of us
are ever gonna get out of.

18:03.482 --> 18:08.153
One big fucking
inescapable pit.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.657
And that is where
we are stuck forever.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.394
Damn, Ivy's right.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.128
We gotta get out of The Pit.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.198
-[all clamoring]
-Yeah, come on, guys,

18:18.265 --> 18:20.733
we're a talented group,
if we work together,
we can escape.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.836
Also if you don't chip in,
I'll stab you.

18:24.805 --> 18:27.240
That was amazing,
you spoke from your heart,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.742
-you started a riot!
-About 30 seconds too late,

18:29.742 --> 18:31.711
let's face it, George Lopez
is never coming back,

18:31.711 --> 18:32.980
I bet they hardly
met his quote.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.347
Harley, I really blew it.

18:35.414 --> 18:36.616
Or maybe not.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.890
-[all clamoring]
-[grunting]

18:45.925 --> 18:48.929
-Here's the plan,
we go on the roof...
-Blah, blah, blah.

18:48.996 --> 18:50.663
-Daddy's got this.
-[gun cocking]

18:50.730 --> 18:52.332
[grunts] Hey!

18:55.301 --> 18:56.951
[screaming]

19:06.747 --> 19:08.414
[yelling]

19:10.651 --> 19:12.300
[screaming]

19:16.455 --> 19:18.325
-[gunshots]
-You still got this?

19:18.391 --> 19:19.625
[Gordon yelling]

19:19.692 --> 19:21.662
Yeah! Yeah, yeah. All good.

19:24.999 --> 19:27.634
Honey, I'm home.

19:27.701 --> 19:29.336
[siren wailing]

19:29.402 --> 19:31.904
You get a shiv. You get a shiv.
You get a shiv.

19:35.509 --> 19:40.446
[Bane] Hey, Ivy, it's clear
you made a breakthrough
in The Pit.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.884
How about you come back
and continue to work
on yourself?

19:43.951 --> 19:45.919
Perhaps a vision board?

19:45.986 --> 19:48.689
-I have some inspo.
-Ah, shove it, Bane.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.290
Yeah, don't take credit
for her emotional growth.
