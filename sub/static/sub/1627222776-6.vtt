WEBVTT

00:19.561 --> 00:25.067
The liar's punishment is
not the least that he is not believed,

00:26.026 --> 00:29.071
but that he cannot believe anyone else.

00:30.572 --> 00:35.369
Micah Keith has perfected
the art of deceit.

00:37.538 --> 00:43.377
But she's also deceived herself,
believing that her lies will go unnoticed.

00:46.421 --> 00:50.592
Micah has been my friend
for more than 30 years.

00:51.301 --> 00:57.057
I've been in the dark
about that friendship for just as long.

01:00.269 --> 01:04.647
Holt Rollins,
a suspect in the murder of Ramon Tomas,

01:04.730 --> 01:06.942
is Micah's lover.

01:11.530 --> 01:17.744
Holt Rollins and Micah Keith
have known each other for nearly 25 years.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.875
Since the day he got out
of prison, she supported him.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.252
She bought him a house.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.671
Gave him a job.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.841
A warm body.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.886
She lied.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.637
To me.

01:36.763 --> 01:37.848
To you.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.934
To the world.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.606
For you.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.654
You need to eat.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.031
Not hungry.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.450
The police still out there?

03:20.951 --> 03:22.077
Yes.

03:22.578 --> 03:26.164
Micah's not coming for you again.
Surprise, surprise!

03:27.624 --> 03:28.834
What kinda sandwich is it?

03:30.586 --> 03:31.837
Pastrami.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.672
I'm a vegan.

03:36.383 --> 03:40.220
A murderer worried about his diet?
Ain't that 'bout a bitch?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.181
Take the meat out.

03:50.522 --> 03:51.857
Did you take your meds?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.360
Would that make more sense to you?

03:56.778 --> 03:59.114
And your answer is yes.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.993
I'm just tired of being erased.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.792
For real though.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.212
You ever wonder?

04:14.922 --> 04:15.923
About what?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.426
What if you and I…

04:21.428 --> 04:22.596
told the truth?

04:25.307 --> 04:26.308
All of it.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.776
Poppy Parnell breaks the internet.

04:35.859 --> 04:39.238
I can't lie. I mean,
you guys stirred up some shit.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.489
Look at this.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.408
I'm sorry I couldn't give you
a better heads-up.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.790
You know, you are allowed to miss her.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.919
How could I have been so wrong about her?

04:54.545 --> 04:56.588
Hey, can I get some grown-ass man back--

04:58.966 --> 05:00.592
-Hey, Poppy.
-Hey.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.387
Why? Trini's in one of her moods again?

05:04.096 --> 05:05.848
You know what? Worse.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.267
She's being sweet which means
she's about to make a big ask.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.726
Yeah.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.937
Well, as long as
she doesn't ask for a horse.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.273
You know, when she was eight,
every single morning--

05:14.356 --> 05:16.817
-At breakfast!
-At breakfast!

05:16.900 --> 05:19.736
For a full-on year,
she would ask for a pony.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.948
Now, where in the hell
are we gonna keep a farm animal?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.783
Where we gonna keep one in--
in North Oakland?

05:24.867 --> 05:26.076
-Exactly!
-Come on!

05:27.536 --> 05:29.204
I better get going.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.956
-Really?
-I will leave you to it.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.166
And…

05:35.586 --> 05:37.296
-Good luck with Micah.
-Uh-huh.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.839
Good luck to you too.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.883
-See you, Poppy.
-Be safe.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.259
Yeah!

05:46.054 --> 05:47.389
It's just work, baby.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.017
It's a good thing you're cute.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.645
Good thing. You're lucky.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.439
Come help me when you can.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.790
HR is swamped with resignations.
What are you doing?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.668
How did she get in here?

06:17.878 --> 06:18.879
What?

06:21.548 --> 06:26.929
I don't want anyone here
who has lost faith in me.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.389
Have you?

06:29.473 --> 06:30.974
No! Never.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.694
It is-- It's just that--

06:42.778 --> 06:44.404
Go ahead. Tell me.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.867
I'm a little worried
about the optics of you being here.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.747
Three of our sponsors have put
their deals on hold.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.167
Virgin canceled our wellness cruise.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.962
Stanford postponed
your speaking engagement,

07:00.045 --> 07:04.007
and pretty much all of what's left
of our investors are asking questions.

07:06.802 --> 07:07.803
And?

07:07.886 --> 07:10.389
Look, I know--
I know that you're suffering,

07:10.472 --> 07:15.227
'cause Poppy's vicious
and baseless accusations are vile.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.147
Which is why I think that maybe
you should take a few weeks off.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.609
You know,
give me a chance to right the ship.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.202
Have I underestimated you, little mouse?

07:33.453 --> 07:38.041
You and Lachlan were so content
to exploit me, and now what?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.918
You wanna tuck me away?

07:40.002 --> 07:41.753
-Out of sight, out of mind?
-No. No!

07:42.504 --> 07:45.549
I believe you, Micah. I believe in you!

07:46.758 --> 07:47.759
You can trust me.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.638
That's what Poppy always said.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.310
I will never step away.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.024
Ever.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.447
Call all of our press contacts.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.492
Let's remind people who I am.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.416
-Who Poppy really is.
-Okay.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.307
Okay, let's run this from the top.

08:37.226 --> 08:41.020
We know Holt Rollins killed Ramon Tomas.

08:42.648 --> 08:43.649
Maybe…

08:45.567 --> 08:50.447
there was evidence in Ramon's apartment
connecting Holt to Micah.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.491
Something Ramon didn't even know about.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.409
You think she ordered Holt to kill Ramon?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.829
Or steal the evidence. Then it got ugly.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.124
Who is Holt Rollins though?

09:03.168 --> 09:07.089
Holt. Holt, Holt, Holt…

09:09.424 --> 09:13.262
Holt is a second-chance hire for Shelter.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.430
Yeah, that's how Markus ID'd him.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.685
You still have those arrest records
from Aames?

09:19.768 --> 09:20.936
Yeah.

09:29.653 --> 09:30.654
Done.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.489
What have we got?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.577
Known associates:

09:36.660 --> 09:38.412
Allen White, shot and killed last year.

09:39.037 --> 09:43.417
Garrett Banks. Went back to jail
last September, out in 2032.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.335
And Rose Gil.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.506
She and Holt were arrested
in a major B and E in LA.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.508
Accused of being involved
in a burglary ring.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.552
Holt got ten years. Rose, five.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.055
Anything on her since?
What about last known address?

09:57.139 --> 10:00.559
Nothing. I checked death certificates
and the Jane Doe database.

10:03.896 --> 10:04.980
Stay on it.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.443
There's something there. I can feel it.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.614
What?

10:13.697 --> 10:15.699
Nice to have Miss Poppy Parnell
back in the house.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.706
Cooking with gas now, baby!

11:00.452 --> 11:02.496
Sit up straight!

11:08.460 --> 11:10.295
I said to sit up straight!

11:30.732 --> 11:32.484
It's okay. I'm here now.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.407
It'll heal. Just like last time.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.877
July 17th, 1997.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.129
July 17th…

12:10.814 --> 12:11.815
Gotcha.

12:16.945 --> 12:20.532
Welcome to Shelter, everybody.
I'm happy to see you.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.576
-Micah.
-Hey, Micah.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.496
Hi. Wow.
I love this surrealist phase, Junior.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.706
-You like it?
-I do.

12:28.665 --> 12:32.085
Hey, do you wanna add your tag?
That red rose you always use.

12:32.711 --> 12:33.754
That's all you, honey.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.590
She's great with them.

12:36.673 --> 12:40.427
Yes, she is. Micah handpicked
every scholarship recipient.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.846
Nothing is more important to her
than the investment in kids.

12:43.514 --> 12:44.932
You should go. Go, go. Please.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.602
What's this called?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.437
Clique.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.275
Who's she?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.361
She's three people.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.112
You?

13:01.198 --> 13:02.449
Schoolmates?

13:03.158 --> 13:07.371
Drea Spivey. Melanie Sanchez.
Leah Ellstrom.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.915
And who are they?

13:11.375 --> 13:12.501
Missing girls.

13:13.627 --> 13:18.215
Just three of the dozens of young girls
who've disappeared from Oakland

13:18.298 --> 13:19.550
in the past few years.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.678
The police haven't located any of them?

13:22.761 --> 13:24.763
No, they'd have to look for them
to find them.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.766
That goes for the local press too.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.189
It's really beautiful.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.195
Noa found out Rose had been
in a board and care facility.

13:40.279 --> 13:42.656
Okay, so what are you saying?

13:42.739 --> 13:46.994
That this woman…
Diane, runs the facility?

13:48.078 --> 13:49.079
Yeah.

13:49.663 --> 13:54.751
And she thinks this call is about
a job opportunity at Shelter.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.336
-Are you freaking nuts?
-Come on.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.088
It's a good lead.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.424
And I'll owe you.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.676
You know how long
that "owe you" list is by now?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.183
Here you go.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.476
-Thank you.
-All right.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.315
Hello, this is Diane Cooper.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.735
Hello, Diane, how you doing?
This is Markus Killebrew.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.737
I'm checking on an applicant

14:21.820 --> 14:24.656
that listed your facility
as a primary residence.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.618
We don't share private information
about our residents.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.621
I completely understand that.
We have the same policy.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.039
But you see, this--

14:32.122 --> 14:35.375
This particular applicant,
Rose, she's special.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.544
And I just wanna see
if I can help her out and--

14:37.628 --> 14:39.505
You heard from Rose? When?

14:41.590 --> 14:42.716
A couple of days ago.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.344
Why? Is there a problem?

14:45.969 --> 14:48.597
Was there any trouble? I'm former OPD.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.434
She's been missing for weeks.
What's your name again?

14:53.310 --> 14:55.979
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's Markus Killebrew.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.982
I'm head of security at Shelter
here in San Francisco.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.817
This is Poppy Parnell.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.903
Do you think Rose could be in danger?

15:02.986 --> 15:03.987
Do you?

15:05.072 --> 15:09.451
Let me ask you a question. Has there been
any recent trouble at your facility?

15:09.993 --> 15:13.330
Well, a few years back,
we had to ban one of Rose's visitors.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.332
The banned visitor never came back,

15:15.415 --> 15:18.168
but about six months ago,
Rose had another visitor.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.504
I remember because she started
her artwork again.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.548
It was like she caught fire.

15:22.631 --> 15:26.093
Let me ask you something. Can you
give me a copy of the visitor ledger?

15:26.176 --> 15:29.805
Our policy prevents against that.
I've already said too much.

15:30.472 --> 15:34.184
Okay, so, how about this?
Why don't you just make some calls?

15:34.268 --> 15:35.561
Check me out, okay?

15:35.644 --> 15:38.105
Do your due diligence
just to be on the safe side,

15:38.188 --> 15:39.731
and you can contact me.

15:41.316 --> 15:45.028
But listen, Diane, trust me, okay?
I'm gonna keep an eye out for Rose.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.573
-I appreciate your time. Thank you.
-Thank you.

15:48.824 --> 15:49.825
Hi.

15:50.450 --> 15:55.205
I wanna talk. In person.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.543
I miss you.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.839
Please.

16:22.733 --> 16:23.734
Hey.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.324
Can't I come in?

16:31.950 --> 16:32.993
Out here is fine.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.043
Well, thanks for picking up the phone.

16:43.295 --> 16:44.796
How do we fix this, Pop?

16:46.256 --> 16:47.466
We're past that.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.469
I just wanna find out who killed Josh.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.221
-And I wanna help you.
-Do you?

16:52.304 --> 16:53.430
Yes.

16:53.514 --> 16:57.851
'Cause you lied about being in love with
the prime suspect of a related murder.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.394
He's not who you think he is.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.772
You chose him over me.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.650
Over Daddy, Cydie, Desiree. Over Josh.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.109
-That is not true.
-Then why weren't you honest?

17:07.736 --> 17:08.987
Because I was scared.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.532
I'm scared! I'm scared every goddamn day,

17:12.616 --> 17:15.953
-but I--
-But what? You don't lie?

17:19.580 --> 17:21.040
Who's Rose Gil?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.381
She was on the streets with me and Holt.

17:27.464 --> 17:30.592
I-- Why are you asking about Rose?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.762
I haven't thought about her for years.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.181
Why didn't you write about her?

17:36.682 --> 17:38.392
Because she was sick.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.145
And I didn't think that was fair.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.359
I couldn't tell her story
without telling that part.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.407
I don't trust you, Micah.

17:56.827 --> 18:00.038
I love you, but I do not trust you.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.543
You know, we've been friends
for most of our lives.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.963
We know a lot about each other.

18:08.922 --> 18:09.923
And?

18:10.591 --> 18:13.051
You hold all of my confidences.

18:16.013 --> 18:17.556
And I hold yours.

18:19.183 --> 18:23.020
So motherfucking what?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.731
I know things that could destroy
this life you built

18:25.814 --> 18:27.649
and this person you pretend to be.

18:54.218 --> 18:57.763
Hey! You got your hair wet!

18:58.597 --> 18:59.640
Shit!

18:59.723 --> 19:02.684
After I spent hours wrestling with
this nappy cotton wool!

19:02.768 --> 19:04.186
It's my fault! Not Poppy's.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.979
Get the hell outta here, little girl!

19:08.190 --> 19:11.485
You know I don't have time for this shit!
Come on! Carry your ass home!

19:11.568 --> 19:14.863
This is the last time you're coming down
to my damn house. Talking back to my ass.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.330
Hey!

19:24.289 --> 19:26.583
Hi! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.585
I'm Micah.

19:28.669 --> 19:29.795
Yeah. Zarina.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.797
I've read your books.
It's good to meet you.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.340
Nice to meet you.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.716
Those are for you.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.094
Wow.

19:38.804 --> 19:39.888
I hope it's not clothes.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.099
Once I got to four months
with my daughter, nothing fit.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.059
-So…
-You're lucky.

19:44.852 --> 19:48.063
Well, I appreciate the gifts.
But how can I help you?

19:49.439 --> 19:51.859
These are the offer papers
for Markus at Shelter.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.241
This is--

20:00.033 --> 20:01.243
This is generous.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.370
He's worth it.

20:05.289 --> 20:08.125
I'm just afraid he's gonna
throw it all away because of some…

20:09.042 --> 20:10.544
devotion to Poppy.

20:13.922 --> 20:17.259
Poppy and I had a falling-out,
and I remain hopeful

20:17.342 --> 20:20.804
but at the moment, it feels irreparable.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.015
Did Markus turn this down?

20:23.515 --> 20:24.516
Not yet.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.687
Thank you for the gifts.
Thank you for your honesty.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.649
I don't back-door in my marriage.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.860
I respect that.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.655
But this is twice his old salary.

20:39.531 --> 20:44.119
Six months paternity leave, an opportunity
for him to create his own security detail.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.287
Okay. Micah.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.499
Poppy left her husband.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.753
She's getting a divorce.

20:54.254 --> 20:58.842
I need Markus. He makes me feel safe.
That is not easy.

21:00.511 --> 21:01.970
We can help each other out.

21:02.930 --> 21:03.931
How?

21:05.390 --> 21:09.061
That proposal is predicated on
his exclusivity to Shelter.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.230
No outside work.

21:12.064 --> 21:13.524
No partnership with Poppy.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.155
You think it over.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.486
All clear here. No sign of Rollins.

22:00.237 --> 22:01.238
10-4…

22:03.740 --> 22:04.950
Copy that. Heading in.

22:07.286 --> 22:11.999
You ever wonder how the cops found us
the night we were arrested?

22:14.877 --> 22:15.961
We were young.

22:17.796 --> 22:18.797
Amateurs.

22:20.299 --> 22:22.342
A few weeks before we were arrested,

22:23.594 --> 22:25.762
they caught Micah
breaking into the school.

22:26.597 --> 22:28.098
They let her off with a warning.

22:29.433 --> 22:35.189
Then, two weeks later,
we get caught red-handed.

22:36.023 --> 22:38.942
She got picked up. Same as we did.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.737
But never charged.

22:43.322 --> 22:46.158
Aren't you getting it yet? She set us up.

22:46.658 --> 22:47.659
Fuck you.

22:47.743 --> 22:50.204
Claimed we were in
some sort of a burglary ring.

22:50.287 --> 22:53.040
You and me.
That's how come we went to jail.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.554
You have killed people to protect her.

23:08.514 --> 23:12.559
If you touch me, I will scream.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.312
Cops right outside, remember?

23:16.980 --> 23:19.483
And they're looking for you.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.152
You and Micah.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.905
Neither of you ever had
any good boundaries.

23:25.614 --> 23:29.284
People get hurt when they don't know
where the lines are. Now you know.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.246
-Micah--
-Stop saying her fucking name!

23:34.456 --> 23:37.292
She didn't protect you then.
She won't protect you now.

23:39.169 --> 23:42.130
You feel it? You feel it's true?
I can see it.

23:47.344 --> 23:49.721
What are you gonna do, huh?

23:51.014 --> 23:54.768
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

23:55.936 --> 23:56.937
Go ahead.

23:58.188 --> 24:00.023
Keep cleaning up her messes.

24:22.296 --> 24:23.672
Hey, Uncle Bug.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.340
Hey.

24:26.383 --> 24:29.011
What's up, Popgun? What you got?

24:37.352 --> 24:38.770
What else we got in here?

24:43.734 --> 24:45.569
I don't wanna read about Vietnam anymore.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.655
Okay. What would you like?

24:50.032 --> 24:51.033
Napoleon.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.120
Well, it's good to see you.

24:55.621 --> 24:57.331
Well, I see you all the time.

24:57.915 --> 25:04.004
Buses, billboards, voice on the airwaves.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.797
You're the talk of the town.

25:06.340 --> 25:09.718
Don't know if that's a good or bad thing.

25:12.763 --> 25:14.431
You and your friend are fightin'.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.225
It's more than that.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.936
She asked to meet.

25:19.019 --> 25:22.147
Wanted a truce. After all she lied about.

25:24.441 --> 25:29.488
You never look for an enemy
where you think she's too scared to go.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.620
Uncle Bug, I wanted to ask you…

25:39.623 --> 25:43.877
After Mama died,
why did Daddy send me to Miss Shirley?

25:43.961 --> 25:45.337
Why didn't he send me with you?

25:46.255 --> 25:47.756
To live where?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.134
Did you know about Miss Shirley?

25:53.512 --> 25:54.721
Everybody knew.

25:55.597 --> 26:00.561
Desiree and Cydie were playing dress-up
and having tea parties in Elysian Fields.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.062
Why not me?

26:03.146 --> 26:05.691
What was so wrong with me
that I got left behind?

26:05.774 --> 26:09.403
You're remembering emotions, not facts.

26:10.112 --> 26:12.281
You ever asked them what it was like
up on them hills?

26:12.364 --> 26:14.074
It can't compare, I'm sure.

26:15.450 --> 26:18.120
-It left me vulnerable to--
-You survived, right?

26:23.041 --> 26:24.168
I endured.

26:26.587 --> 26:28.672
But not every piece of me survived.

26:31.133 --> 26:33.343
The little girl that went
into Miss Shirley's house

26:33.427 --> 26:35.304
is not the same one that came out.

27:17.304 --> 27:18.305
Hey.

27:18.388 --> 27:21.308
Yo. Heard from Diane
at the board and care.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.476
-Yeah?
-She told me that

27:22.559 --> 27:24.603
Holt Rollins was the banned visitor.

27:25.103 --> 27:26.188
And the second visitor?

27:26.271 --> 27:27.272
Joshua Keith.

27:27.981 --> 27:31.235
Josh went to see Rose
six months before his murder.

27:33.487 --> 27:35.113
We have to find her, Markus.

27:35.197 --> 27:36.990
Yes, we do, but how?

27:42.246 --> 27:46.792
The Romans used to speak of
"memoria praeteritorum bonorum."

27:47.751 --> 27:53.423
Roughly translated, this means,
"The past is always well-remembered."

27:54.424 --> 27:59.096
It's a phenomenon psychologists refer to
as rosy retrospection.

27:59.680 --> 28:05.811
A tendency to disproportionately
positively remember the past.

28:05.894 --> 28:11.525
This idea assumes
you have a past worth romanticizing.

28:12.526 --> 28:17.698
But what of those born and bred
in trauma? Scarcity?

28:18.574 --> 28:22.119
What leeway are they afforded
to reckon with their past?

28:22.953 --> 28:29.668
For most of her life,
Rose Gil was erased by society.

28:30.419 --> 28:34.590
She spent over 20 years
living on the streets without a real home.

28:35.465 --> 28:41.722
She was, as Micah so aptly coined,
"a discard."

28:43.140 --> 28:49.479
Rose Gil met with Joshua Keith
mere months before his death.

28:50.230 --> 28:55.944
A moment that incited a dramatic change
in both of their behavior.

28:56.445 --> 29:00.949
She then ran away from the only place
that ever looked after her,

29:01.658 --> 29:06.205
just two days before
Joshua Keith was murdered.

29:06.705 --> 29:11.376
Only one person knows for certain
how those events are related.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.130
That person is you, Rose.

29:15.714 --> 29:19.426
I'm not your judge, jury or executioner.

29:20.511 --> 29:26.642
If you hear this, Rose,
please, please contact me.

29:28.268 --> 29:32.523
I offer you this platform so that you are
no longer erased.

29:33.273 --> 29:36.735
Whatever you've done,
whatever's been done to you,

29:37.903 --> 29:44.076
let Reconsidered be a safe place
to tell your story in your words.

29:46.453 --> 29:51.500
My name is Poppy Parnell,
and I'd like you to reconsider.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.001
Poppy!

29:53.544 --> 29:55.295
-Yeah?
-We got a problem.

29:56.505 --> 29:58.924
Bay Morning is airing
a segment on Micah Keith.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.261
So? We knew a puff piece was coming.

30:02.803 --> 30:03.846
Hey.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.806
Less puff, more huff. At you.

30:06.557 --> 30:07.558
Micah Keith,

30:07.641 --> 30:11.395
whose foundation has established
youth programs around the Bay Area,

30:11.478 --> 30:15.065
states, "I don't understand it either
about Mrs. Parnell.

30:15.148 --> 30:18.151
We here at Shelter try
to use our resources to assist.

30:18.235 --> 30:20.153
To lift up those less fortunate."

30:20.237 --> 30:21.446
This bitch Miss Parnell'd you?

30:21.530 --> 30:25.450
Mrs. Keith, a native of the area,
took me on a tour of The Keith Collective

30:25.534 --> 30:29.788
in an underserved community
that Mrs. Parnell continues to ignore

30:29.872 --> 30:32.624
on her popular nationwide podcast.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.918
Mrs. Keith attended
the neighborhood watch meeting,

30:35.002 --> 30:38.130
which took place at The Knock,
a second home to Parnell,

30:38.213 --> 30:40.215
currently owned by Parnell's father

30:40.299 --> 30:43.260
and leader of the infamous
Capstone motorcycle club.

30:43.343 --> 30:44.344
It's a hit piece.

30:44.428 --> 30:46.680
Parnell's blatant neglect
of her own community…

30:46.763 --> 30:48.891
-Cydie.
-…remains baffling as she dives into

30:48.974 --> 30:50.976
yet another high-profile case,

30:51.560 --> 30:53.896
while young women disappear quietly

30:53.979 --> 30:56.148
from the same neighborhood
where she grew up.

30:56.648 --> 31:00.360
We reached out to Parnell for comment,
but she hasn't responded.

31:01.570 --> 31:03.363
I'm Susan Laura reporting live…

31:03.447 --> 31:06.241
-Oh, hell. Cydie!
-…and we'll be right back.

31:10.204 --> 31:11.580
Watch out! Come here.

31:17.711 --> 31:20.839
Hi. I need you to move that bike.

31:20.923 --> 31:22.883
-Tell her to bring her ass outside.
-Okay.

31:22.966 --> 31:25.511
I know she in there giving a speech
to some gullible ass bitches.

31:25.594 --> 31:27.971
-Okay, sweetie, but I'm gonna need you--
-Don't call me fucking sweetie.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.306
-Okay, I'm sorry. Can you--
-Hey!

31:29.389 --> 31:31.391
-You grimy, thievin', hustlin'…
-What are you doing?

31:31.475 --> 31:33.352
-…pitiful ass bitch.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:33.435 --> 31:35.020
This is not the place for this.

31:35.103 --> 31:38.065
Yeah, if it wasn't for my sister,
you wouldn't have none of this.

31:38.148 --> 31:41.151
She made you! Let you into her home,
gave you a family.

31:41.235 --> 31:42.694
-Cydie, come on.
-And you do this to her?

31:42.778 --> 31:43.779
Stop talking.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.031
And you sent Holt to my bus
trying to intimidate me?

31:46.114 --> 31:47.366
What are you talking about?

31:47.449 --> 31:49.993
-You don't know nothing about that?
-No, I don't know anything.

31:50.077 --> 31:51.286
-Calm down.
-You aren't even worth

31:51.370 --> 31:52.955
-the gas it took to get here!
-Hey! Hey!

31:53.038 --> 31:54.498
-Whoa, hey, hey, hey!
-Fuck!

31:54.581 --> 31:56.375
-I'll beat your ass…
-I will fucking fight you.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.043
-…right here, right now.
-You wanna beat my ass?

31:58.126 --> 32:00.671
-I will beat your ass right now.
-I'll fucking fight you! Yeah? Come on!

32:00.754 --> 32:02.256
-Get Micah back inside.
-Fuck you!

32:02.339 --> 32:05.634
Everybody who tries to love your trick ass
ends up dead.

32:05.717 --> 32:08.136
-Hey. That's it.
-Micah, come inside.

32:09.596 --> 32:11.181
-Calm down.
-Get off me!

32:13.016 --> 32:14.017
And you!

32:15.310 --> 32:16.645
You're riding with that ho?

32:17.855 --> 32:21.316
You know what? You chose wrong then,
and you're choosing wrong now.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.735
Wait, hold on!
How did this become my shit?

32:24.695 --> 32:27.155
You out here clowning
like it's the Eastmont Mall.

32:28.156 --> 32:29.867
This is my business!

32:30.659 --> 32:31.702
Go home!

32:31.785 --> 32:33.120
Fuck all y'all.

32:39.710 --> 32:41.044
All these goddamn women.

32:51.430 --> 32:52.431
Hey.

32:52.514 --> 32:53.515
Hey, Elk.

32:53.599 --> 32:55.517
-Hey, sweetheart. Look at you.
-Hey, Daddy.

32:56.268 --> 32:57.561
Lillian still in Georgia?

32:57.644 --> 32:59.104
Another couple weeks.

33:00.439 --> 33:02.482
Gives me more time to spend with you.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.779
You worried about that news report?

33:07.863 --> 33:10.949
She warned me how much she could
blow up my life if I mess with her,

33:12.034 --> 33:14.703
which is probably why she asked me
to help in the first place.

33:15.370 --> 33:17.789
Felt like she had something on me
to keep me in line.

33:18.540 --> 33:19.541
Does she?

33:23.212 --> 33:24.671
I saw Uncle Bug yesterday.

33:27.132 --> 33:29.468
He embarrassed your mother's family
more than me.

33:29.551 --> 33:34.056
Those saditty ass folks in Elysian Field
didn't want to deal with riffraff like me

33:34.139 --> 33:36.350
or crazy motherfuckers in the mix.

33:36.433 --> 33:37.559
And Bug?

33:38.352 --> 33:40.312
He was crazy in the cradle.

33:43.315 --> 33:44.316
Daddy…

33:46.610 --> 33:49.613
Did you know Miss Shirley hated
me and Mama when you sent me there?

33:51.949 --> 33:54.409
Why didn't you just send me
to her side of the family?

33:55.661 --> 33:56.662
They didn't want you.

33:59.289 --> 34:01.583
Elinor's family cut her off
when we got together.

34:03.043 --> 34:06.129
To them, she didn't exist anymore,
which meant you didn't exist.

34:07.297 --> 34:09.757
And none of them came to her funeral.
Nary one of 'em.

34:10.634 --> 34:14.596
Her favorite cousin, Leona,
showed up at the repast, but…

34:15.931 --> 34:17.558
no one was at the burial.

34:19.059 --> 34:20.561
Is that why you were so angry?

34:20.643 --> 34:22.603
One of many reasons.

34:25.774 --> 34:27.484
Leona offered to take two of you.

34:27.568 --> 34:30.529
I thought it best that
the two youngest girls stay together.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.074
The only other person who offered to help
was Shirley.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.538
Why you thinking about this?

34:39.621 --> 34:41.873
Because I'm sick in the head,
you think I'll forget?

34:41.956 --> 34:42.958
No, Daddy.

34:43.958 --> 34:44.960
No.

34:45.043 --> 34:49.089
All this business with Micah just got me
thinking about when I first met her.

34:49.672 --> 34:50.674
That's all.

34:54.052 --> 34:57.556
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, Daddy. Yeah.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.397
I'm worried about you.

35:08.734 --> 35:11.278
Rose, I need you to take your pills.

35:11.945 --> 35:14.948
She said she wanted me to call her.
Why won't she call me back?

35:15.032 --> 35:18.577
Because Poppy Parnell doesn't give a fuck
about you or me.

35:20.037 --> 35:22.080
Maybe she hasn't checked the tip line yet.

35:22.748 --> 35:23.957
I just need to think.

35:24.041 --> 35:26.043
Think, think, think, think…

35:29.713 --> 35:30.756
Let's go see her.

35:30.839 --> 35:35.385
I can't. Cops are still out there.
I walk out those doors, I go to jail.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.015
Rose…

35:41.391 --> 35:42.684
Take your pills.

35:47.064 --> 35:48.357
You mean these?

35:52.402 --> 35:54.863
-Come on, Rose. Don't do that.
-Don't condescend to me.

35:59.368 --> 36:02.663
I wanna send this to Poppy
and arrange a meeting for us.

36:04.206 --> 36:06.208
Then let's see what she has to--

36:21.598 --> 36:23.225
Holt, stop.

36:27.980 --> 36:29.064
Holt.

36:30.399 --> 36:31.400
Holt.

36:40.534 --> 36:43.370
I'm sorry. So sorry.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.165
You gotta stop defending her.

36:49.251 --> 36:51.170
You gotta stop protecting her.

36:52.838 --> 36:55.132
She married someone else.
She loved someone else.

36:57.050 --> 36:58.760
She doesn't love you.

37:16.028 --> 37:17.029
Fuck.

37:28.165 --> 37:29.666
Oh, shit, I'm trending.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.335
-I'll beat your ass…
-I will fucking fight you.

37:31.418 --> 37:33.003
-…right here, right now.
-You wanna beat my ass?

37:33.086 --> 37:34.838
Yeah, spreading like wildfire.

37:36.548 --> 37:37.925
You ever look into Drea's case?

37:39.343 --> 37:40.344
Yeah.

37:41.678 --> 37:43.931
Is that why you've been so pissed?

37:44.806 --> 37:49.728
Look, I love you, but the person
with the loudest voice can't be silent.

37:50.562 --> 37:53.232
And if they do, they can't come over here
to lick wounds.

37:53.857 --> 37:55.609
Well, I didn't come for that.

37:57.236 --> 37:58.320
Well, what then?

38:02.491 --> 38:04.326
I came to ask you about Leona.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.745
Mama's cousin y'all stayed with.

38:07.996 --> 38:09.289
I loved her.

38:09.373 --> 38:11.333
I used to play dress-up in her closet
all the time.

38:12.417 --> 38:13.877
That's not how I remember it.

38:14.628 --> 38:15.879
Why not?

38:16.463 --> 38:19.591
We weren't welcome there,
no matter what you think.

38:20.551 --> 38:23.303
We were the ghetto orphans,
and we could never forget it.

38:25.722 --> 38:26.807
What?

38:26.890 --> 38:30.435
That wasn't dress-up.
She put us in there and told us to play

38:30.519 --> 38:33.397
whenever she had Jack and Jill meetings
for her kids.

38:33.981 --> 38:35.190
We were not welcome.

38:37.985 --> 38:42.406
I got so mad one time, I ran a bath
and threw all her wigs in the tub.

38:43.657 --> 38:46.159
And then I went to go hide
in her sewing room.

38:46.243 --> 38:47.995
Weren't you afraid she'd find you?

38:49.496 --> 38:52.124
I hide in the places
I'd been told never to go.

38:54.418 --> 38:59.631
Never look for an enemy
where you think they're too afraid to go.

39:01.925 --> 39:02.926
I gotta go.

39:03.677 --> 39:04.887
This girl…

39:06.513 --> 39:08.223
You know she missed curfew again
last night?

39:08.307 --> 39:09.641
-She what?
-Yeah.

39:09.725 --> 39:12.769
She was going to crew practice
before I got up this morning.

39:13.312 --> 39:15.397
-But see, here's what we're gonna do.
-Oh, my God.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.481
I got the plan.

39:17.232 --> 39:19.610
As soon as she walks through that door
to eat dinner…

39:20.194 --> 39:21.987
as soon as she comes in,

39:22.571 --> 39:24.198
we're gonna snatch up that phone,

39:24.865 --> 39:27.075
and we're gonna replace it with this baby.

39:28.493 --> 39:30.370
-This is good.
-Yes, it is.

39:30.454 --> 39:32.039
-No pictures, no games…
-None of that.

39:32.122 --> 39:33.749
…no social media. Yes.

39:33.832 --> 39:36.335
-None of that.
-So when does she get her phone back?

39:36.418 --> 39:37.544
Whenever I say.

39:41.423 --> 39:43.258
-Hold on one second, baby.
-Uh-huh.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.052
Hey, Pop. What's happening?

39:45.552 --> 39:49.056
Hey, I'm headed to the city.
Holt's place. Can you meet me?

39:49.139 --> 39:51.892
-Hey, we're about to sit down to dinner.
-I know, I know.

39:51.975 --> 39:54.478
Listen, listen. This is not a great time.

39:54.561 --> 39:56.772
I'm about to sit down
and eat dinner with the fam.

39:56.855 --> 39:58.690
I think he's hiding there, Markus.

40:00.359 --> 40:01.360
Really?

40:04.196 --> 40:06.156
All right, look. I'm on my way.

40:07.908 --> 40:09.326
Baby, that was--

40:09.409 --> 40:10.911
A conflict of interest?

40:11.745 --> 40:13.789
-Rina, come on, now.
-She's getting divorced.

40:14.289 --> 40:15.290
What?

40:15.832 --> 40:18.460
Ingram left her.
Moved back to the East Coast.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.842
-Who told you that?
-Micah.

40:24.925 --> 40:25.926
Micah?

40:26.009 --> 40:27.970
All that time that you spend together,

40:28.053 --> 40:30.639
and you haven't noticed that
she stopped wearing her wedding ring.

40:35.769 --> 40:36.895
Baby.

40:37.604 --> 40:39.565
-Hey, Rina, I'm--
-Just go already.

40:56.665 --> 40:59.293
Hey. You see 'em
lurking back there, right?

40:59.376 --> 41:00.586
-Unmarked?
-Uh-huh.

41:00.669 --> 41:01.795
Yeah.

41:01.879 --> 41:03.463
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:07.176 --> 41:08.510
That looks like blood.

41:09.803 --> 41:11.096
You feeling what I'm feeling?

41:11.597 --> 41:12.598
Uh-huh.

41:14.057 --> 41:15.058
Go, go.

41:36.079 --> 41:37.080
Hey.

41:37.706 --> 41:38.999
-Take it easy.
-Sorry.

42:01.522 --> 42:03.232
Whoa. What you doing? What you doing?

42:03.315 --> 42:05.150
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch anything.

42:05.234 --> 42:06.235
Okay.

42:21.458 --> 42:23.752
You know, you were right.
Someone was here.

42:26.922 --> 42:27.923
Yeah.

42:28.465 --> 42:29.633
Something went down.

42:45.691 --> 42:46.733
Hey, over here.

42:52.406 --> 42:54.408
-You got it?
-Yep.

42:57.911 --> 43:01.081
-"Ari--" You--
-"Aripiprazole."

43:01.164 --> 43:03.333
-What is that?
-It's an antipsychotic.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.169
It's Rose's. She was here too.

43:05.252 --> 43:06.795
San Francisco PD!

43:06.879 --> 43:09.006
-Don't move!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:09.089 --> 43:10.883
-Keep 'em up!
-Don't think about it, man.

43:12.009 --> 43:13.177
We're here on location.

43:13.260 --> 43:16.972
We have two suspects in the house
at this time. We need backup.

43:18.098 --> 43:21.185
You've reached the Reconsidered
tip line. Please leave a message.

43:21.977 --> 43:23.979
Poppy, this is Rose Gil.

43:24.855 --> 43:26.356
I think you're looking for me.
