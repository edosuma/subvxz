survive at a higher rate

04:56.494 --> 04:57.928
than the American marriage

when you say, "I have
to be falling in love,

"and it has to click."

05:02.100 --> 05:05.135
for a year or two the way Americans do

05:05.136 --> 05:08.973
and still 50% of the marriages fail,

05:08.974 --> 05:12.610
- the reason is compatibility, value, the belief.
- MOM: Yeah.

05:12.611 --> 05:14.245
Like we got married, me and Mom,

05:14.246 --> 05:16.147
I only talked to her 10 minutes.

05:16.148 --> 05:18.216

that works for me as well?

05:18.217 --> 05:20.050
- Absolutely!
- MOM: Absolutely.

05:20.051 --> 05:22.719
- DAD: If you ask me, 100%, I believe...
- MOM: Yeah.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.990
...from the bottom of the
heart, not even a doubt.

05:25.991 --> 05:28.493
Everything affects our thinking and liking

05:28.494 --> 05:30.560
whether you are going to put
up with the person or not,

05:30.561 --> 05:32.729
if your, if her food habits are different.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.231
Food habits is the first reason?

05:34.232 --> 05:35.866
No, no, I'm giving you a reason at random.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.935
You want to focus on a girl

05:37.936 --> 05:42.038
who has same value in the life

05:42.039 --> 05:45.543
and have been raised same way you have,

05:45.544 --> 05:49.012
and especially keeping in
mind the religion is same.

05:49.013 --> 05:50.548

05:50.549 --> 05:52.649
every Indian family is good for you.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.651
That is why we select.

05:54.652 --> 05:56.019
RAVI: You had to check the
family and the background

05:56.020 --> 05:58.288
because you only get 10
minutes to meet the person.

05:58.289 --> 05:59.690
Whereas I'm saying, you date the person.

05:59.691 --> 06:01.858
- You get a better sense of who a person is...
- MOM: No, no, no...

06:01.859 --> 06:03.560
...by spending time with that person

06:03.561 --> 06:04.928
than by finding out who their family is.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.930
- That's why there's a matchmaking.
- MOM: Aha!

06:06.931 --> 06:08.565
If this girl is good with that boy

06:08.566 --> 06:10.000
but that boy is good with this girl,

06:10.001 --> 06:11.202
so everybody is good,

06:11.203 --> 06:13.704
everybody gets married at the end.

06:13.705 --> 06:15.706
All the girls and all the boys get married.

06:15.707 --> 06:19.075
What would be the downside
of me marrying a white girl?

06:19.076 --> 06:21.144
A white girl, a white girl?

06:21.145 --> 06:23.113

say a white American girl.

<i>I have a huge family,

06:36.227 --> 06:38.262
<i>And here's the thing, they're

06:38.263 --> 06:40.264
<i>See, these are the

<i>you're supposed to marry

06:43.568 --> 06:45.168
Now, it's not incest. It's...
it's like a caste thing.

06:45.169 --> 06:46.303
It means... uh,

06:46.304 --> 06:49.173
that they're from this
small little region of India.

Eighty to 90% Patel...

06:57.049 --> 06:58.214
...is Patels.

06:58.215 --> 07:00.750
The story starts she's from Anand.

07:00.751 --> 07:02.786
I am from Dharmaj.

07:02.787 --> 07:05.122
My brother got married to her sister.

07:05.123 --> 07:08.825
I was only 18, she was 14.

07:08.826 --> 07:10.161
(LAUGHS)

07:10.162 --> 07:12.930
We decided that both families, you know,

07:12.931 --> 07:14.264
liked each other.

07:14.265 --> 07:15.765
And then we were told that we are going to

07:15.766 --> 07:18.336
meet each other at this person's house

07:18.337 --> 07:19.971
and our parents were waiting outside

07:19.972 --> 07:21.938
and we went in the room

07:21.939 --> 07:23.908
and given five minutes to take care of it.

07:23.909 --> 07:26.344
We had a guy in the middle of
us so there's no hanky-panky.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.012
In India,

07:28.013 --> 07:30.647
the girls don't have much
of a say in those days.

07:30.648 --> 07:33.718
Girls have to get married
to who their parents say,

07:33.719 --> 07:36.053
so I said, "No, that's not fair."

07:36.054 --> 07:38.623
I said, "If you have anything in your mind,

07:38.624 --> 07:40.257
"you want to marry
someone else, let me know,

07:40.258 --> 07:42.125
"and I will say no.

"So that way, you don't have to say no."

07:43.695 --> 07:44.894
I went back and told my family,

07:44.895 --> 07:46.197
I said, "This is the girl I want to marry."

07:46.198 --> 07:48.065
It took five minutes though... Right?

07:48.066 --> 07:50.901
We never said anything, just
hi, hello, and that's it.

Oh, you're shaking your head
already, that's way too far?

08:40.686 --> 08:43.054
How far apart do they have
to be for it to be justified?

08:43.054 --> 08:45.022
Well, usually there should be no relation.

08:45.023 --> 08:46.724
Because everyone is probably still,

08:46.725 --> 08:48.059
a lot of these people
are probably still related

23:34.244 --> 23:36.846
you're physically small humans.

23:36.847 --> 23:38.814
The first word that
came to mind was "cheap."

23:38.815 --> 23:40.951
Patels own motels or own hotels

23:40.952 --> 23:42.851
or, you know, 7-Elevens.

23:42.852 --> 23:44.119
RAVI: If I pay to stay somewhere,

23:44.120 --> 23:47.122
it's purely as a result of me
not making enough phone calls.

23:47.123 --> 23:50.225
You know, it's really like
Gujarati people in America are

23:50.226 --> 23:53.062
often the working class
in India that came over.

23:53.063 --> 23:58.601
I came to America actually in December '67.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.244
<i>(SPIRIT IN THE SKY</i> SONG PLAYING )

24:19.255 --> 24:23.092
When our children came to a marriage age,

24:23.093 --> 24:27.797
there was a need for
some kind of matchmaking,

24:27.798 --> 24:29.064
girl to a boy.

24:29.065 --> 24:31.835
This book gives the names and addresses

24:31.836 --> 24:34.037
of all the 24 villages.

24:34.038 --> 24:37.741
- And these are all Patels! All Patels.
- Oh yeah. All Patels.

24:37.742 --> 24:39.775
DAD: <i>Problem is, all
the Patels who came,</i>

24:39.776 --> 24:43.379
<i>they are spread all over
50 states in America.</i>

24:43.380 --> 24:46.383
How do you still follow the same system

24:46.384 --> 24:49.886
that was workable back
home in the small area

24:49.887 --> 24:50.986
but not workable here

24:50.987 --> 24:54.924
because of the geographic,
you know, the distance.

24:54.925 --> 24:56.259
So what happened?

24:56.260 --> 24:59.263
RAVI: <i>What happened is
they invented the bio-data.</i>

25:01.831 --> 25:04.000
<i>The bio-data is a sheet
of paper, like a resume,</i>

25:04.001 --> 25:05.100
<i>that the parents pass around</i>

25:05.101 --> 25:07.404
<i>to help them make
an informed decision</i>

25:07.405 --> 25:08.972
<i>when they're making matches.</i>

25:08.973 --> 25:10.706
RAJ: <i>Nobody writes
their own bio-data.</i>

25:10.707 --> 25:12.242
It's done by committee

25:12.243 --> 25:14.910
and it's a very rosy picture of yourself

25:14.911 --> 25:17.246
that really isn't you.

25:17.247 --> 25:20.316
I never gave my mom an
actual physical bio-data,

25:20.317 --> 25:22.252
I refused, I was like,

25:22.253 --> 25:25.855
I'm not going to resume
myself out on a piece of paper,

25:25.856 --> 25:27.322
and she's like, "Give me a resume,"

25:27.323 --> 25:28.957
and so I sent her my work resume.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.193
I've never seen mine,

25:30.194 --> 25:32.262
I've never, 'cause I
just don't want to know.

25:32.263 --> 25:35.064
I go to a wedding and I run into this lady.

25:35.065 --> 25:37.466
She's like, "Oh, my God,
come sit down next to me,

25:37.467 --> 25:39.735
"you are just... you're so wonderful,

25:39.736 --> 25:41.404
"and gosh, you know, had your dad

25:41.405 --> 25:43.439
"sent a better picture of you,

25:43.440 --> 25:44.741
- "you could have been my daughter-in-law."
- (LAUGHING LOUDLY)

25:44.742 --> 25:45.841
And I'm like...

25:45.842 --> 25:47.277
RAVI: <i>Here's what's on my bio-data,</i>

25:47.278 --> 25:49.945

25:49.946 --> 25:52.982
<i>occupation, education, hobbies,</i>

25:52.983 --> 25:54.050
<i>and then there's stuff
I have no interest in,</i>

25:54.051 --> 25:56.319
<i>like parent's location
and work history,</i>

25:56.320 --> 25:58.420
<i>sibling location and work history,</i>

25:58.421 --> 26:01.224
<i>horoscope, caste, skin complexion,</i>

26:01.225 --> 26:02.259
<i>there's "wheatish brown,"</i>

26:02.260 --> 26:04.194
<i>I think I've seen "almond brown."</i>

26:04.195 --> 26:05.762
It's like the lighter you are,

26:05.763 --> 26:06.862
the more attractive you are.

26:06.863 --> 26:09.299
They talk about the homely,
wheatish complexion girl,

26:09.300 --> 26:10.766
I mean, it's a running joke.

26:10.767 --> 26:12.935
Well, one, the word homely is used wrong.

26:12.936 --> 26:14.337
Hey, Hasmukh, what's up?

26:14.338 --> 26:16.772
Listen, got your daughter's bio-data,

26:16.773 --> 26:20.976
oh, great job, I mean, PhD. Really?

26:20.977 --> 26:23.012
Okay, see, here's the thing.

26:23.013 --> 26:27.349
Um, Raj is more of a wheatish brown,

26:27.350 --> 26:29.152
he's just, yeah, he's just had a good life,

26:29.153 --> 26:30.919
and we've kept him out
of the sun on purpose.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.955
So good to talk to you,

26:32.956 --> 26:38.027
and good luck with that
dark daughter of yours...

26:38.028 --> 26:40.396
Congrats again on the PhD, great job.

26:40.397 --> 26:42.898
<i>So after I gave Mom
and Dad my bio-data,</i>

26:42.899 --> 26:45.935
<i>they could officially release
it into the marketplace.</i>

26:45.936 --> 26:48.772
<i>Within weeks, my bio-data
was in the hands of uncles,</i>

26:48.773 --> 26:52.775
<i>aunts, family friends

26:52.776 --> 26:54.444
<i>Now while my bio-data

26:54.445 --> 26:55.846
<i>in the marketplace, Mom and Dad</i>

26:55.847 --> 26:59.249

other people's bio-datas.</i>

26:59.250 --> 27:01.451

them based on what type of women</i>

27:01.452 --> 27:03.118
<i>they think would be
a good fit for me.</i>

27:03.119 --> 27:06.089
Looks good, so I'm going to
forward this to Ravi, okay?

27:06.090 --> 27:07.991
RAVI: <i>And by the end of January,</i>

27:07.992 --> 27:10.326
<i>I got my first batch of bio-datas.</i>

27:10.327 --> 27:12.494
Dad sent me 20 bio-datas,

27:12.495 --> 27:15.298
so basically, 20 pictures and resumes

27:15.299 --> 27:20.102
of matrimonial candidates,
which is totally normal. Right?

27:20.103 --> 27:21.905
This is the one I like the most,

27:21.906 --> 27:26.509
she's 28, she's 5'4", 124 pounds...

27:26.510 --> 27:29.378
Is she getting one of these of you?

27:29.379 --> 27:31.214
RAVI: I would imagine, yeah.

27:31.215 --> 27:33.849
And can she also veto
or give the thumbs-up?

27:33.850 --> 27:34.885
Yeah, this is her preferences,

27:34.886 --> 27:36.452
oh, they have a preferences
section at the bottom.

"Preferences: Academic

I've been doing this since I was 20.

33:34.378 --> 33:37.714
And how many of those
resulted in second dates?

33:39.515 --> 33:41.650
None.

33:41.651 --> 33:42.885
Well, we should be talking about you then.

33:51.728 --> 33:52.695
and I'm like, no, I don't want to do it,

33:52.696 --> 33:53.562
they were like, let's
put an ad in the paper,

33:53.563 --> 33:54.696
'cause that's what a lot of people do

33:54.697 --> 33:57.599

an ad in the classifieds.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.935

33:58.936 --> 34:01.670

alliance for our daughter..."

34:04.474 --> 34:06.408

34:06.409 --> 34:09.445
- The fact that the term alliance is used...
- (LAUGHTER)

34:09.446 --> 34:11.379

- Alliance is the right word, yeah.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.983
"Homely and comely," whoever
knows what that means.

34:13.984 --> 34:15.449
"Homely and comely, wheatish complexion."

34:15.451 --> 34:17.585

and people like, lather it onto their skin.

34:27.897 --> 34:29.764

- A skin-bleaching lotion...

34:29.766 --> 34:31.766
- JOSH: No way.
- ...to try and get lighter.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.268

34:57.893 --> 34:58.928
I guess I'm just confused

34:58.929 --> 35:01.463

somebody who you love

35:01.464 --> 35:04.367

you do want to be with

I don't even know how I figured it out,

44:03.973 --> 44:05.307

44:05.308 --> 44:07.809

only talked maybe 10 minutes.

44:18.121 --> 44:19.388

44:22.058 --> 44:23.325
"How far have you traveled?"

44:23.326 --> 44:24.959

44:24.960 --> 44:28.229
She said, "I traveled
all the way to Pavagadh."

44:28.230 --> 44:29.997
Now, Pavagadh is only 30 miles away.

44:29.998 --> 44:33.202

I disappoint her in life

44:54.190 --> 44:56.057

45:12.275 --> 45:14.075

figure out what I want.

to, like, hide it from you.

46:48.237 --> 46:50.372
I mean, I was trying to hide it from you,

We were both dating other people,

54:51.786 --> 54:54.222
we'd slowly kinda cuddle a little bit

54:54.223 --> 54:57.725
but in very non-committal
cuddling, so our toes,

54:57.726 --> 55:00.662
like I think our feet started
getting closer together

55:00.663 --> 55:02.597
and then next thing you know, our legs...

55:02.598 --> 55:04.131
I was so nervous that I was like,

55:04.132 --> 55:05.966
I remember I was stuttering a lot, "Um...

55:05.967 --> 55:10.238
"Do, do you think we should,
um, like we should uh, like,

55:10.239 --> 55:12.740
- "this is, like, this is weird right?"

And of course, to me, the
bury-the-head-in-the-pillow

55:21.150 --> 55:22.249
was like a bad sign
because that's the only way

55:22.250 --> 55:24.885
I'm willing to interpret
any situation with a girl,

55:24.886 --> 55:26.120
is like rejection.

55:26.121 --> 55:28.055
She was really nervous too.

55:28.056 --> 55:31.626
I was like, should we start
dating or something, or...

55:33.561 --> 55:37.698

55:37.699 --> 55:39.734
and then I walked her to her car,

55:39.735 --> 55:42.736
and I'm saying bye, and
like, this is the first time

55:42.737 --> 55:44.104
it's been this kind of a bye.

55:44.105 --> 55:45.205
I was like, "Well, should we kiss?"

55:45.206 --> 55:46.673
She goes like, "Yeah, I guess,"

55:46.674 --> 55:48.742
and then we go in and it's like a kiss,

55:48.743 --> 55:53.780
and it is the worst kiss
in the history of kisses.

55:53.781 --> 55:56.751
Like it was disgusting, you know,

55:56.752 --> 55:59.787

55:59.788 --> 56:02.089
and we were friends.

56:02.090 --> 56:05.092
Any man would have handled
that better than me, I think.

56:06.761 --> 56:09.097

of just self-loathing.

been maybe somewhat different,

there were not Indians,

RAVI: <i>I was looking around,</i>

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:08.729
<i>and our extended family represents</i>

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:11.499
<i>a version of life that I
always thought I would have,</i>

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.466
<i>and for the first time
I was starting to doubt</i>

01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:16.236
<i>whether or not that's
what I'd end up with.</i>

01:06:25.246 --> 01:06:27.714

01:06:27.715 --> 01:06:30.251
<i>in the pursuit of all these things,</i>

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:32.352
<i>ending up alone.</i>

01:06:32.353 --> 01:06:34.588
I think, first thing we should talk about

01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:38.191
is how much do you respect this process

01:06:38.192 --> 01:06:41.729
that parents or whoever
can screen and can do it?

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.631
RAVI: I have a ton of respect
for the process, in fact, I...

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.466
Are you giving that respect

01:06:45.467 --> 01:06:47.734
when we say, "Meet this girl"?

01:06:47.735 --> 01:06:49.303
No, because I don't...

01:06:49.304 --> 01:06:51.305
DAD: And if you don't meet,

01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:55.676
if that respect is not
understood by the children

01:06:55.677 --> 01:06:57.510
and children casually throw,

01:06:57.511 --> 01:06:59.812
"Oh, I don't like this, I don't click."

01:06:59.813 --> 01:07:01.414
That is when I tell Mom,

01:07:01.415 --> 01:07:03.484
I say, "You know what, forget it,

01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:05.519
"we are not going to do this."

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.490
Because they think we found
these online somewhere at random

01:07:10.491 --> 01:07:12.325
that we don't know anything about this

01:07:12.326 --> 01:07:16.196
and that we throw them because we
want to get them married in hurry

01:07:16.197 --> 01:07:17.865
and we don't care who
they get married with.

01:07:17.866 --> 01:07:19.566
MOM: I really believe, my prince,

01:07:19.567 --> 01:07:22.769
you are not being fair to yourself.

01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:25.573
You are not giving yourself enough chance,

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:28.809
you are not giving your life a fair chance.

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:30.443
It is a mindset.

01:07:30.444 --> 01:07:32.479
GEETA: We don't have
the same mindset you do,

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.747
and honestly, I don't
even have the same mindset.

01:07:33.748 --> 01:07:34.914
That is why, Geeta, you are not married,

01:07:34.915 --> 01:07:36.816
and I'm telling you the reasoning.

01:07:36.817 --> 01:07:40.588
If you are ready to know
that why Geeta is not married,

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.256
why other people are getting married

01:07:42.257 --> 01:07:44.457
then I'm going to tell you
the differences, my dear,

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:48.262
that the other girls are in
the mindset to get married,

01:07:48.263 --> 01:07:50.597
they don't want to just reject right away.

01:07:50.598 --> 01:07:53.667
They want to get to know
people, they meet second time,

01:07:53.668 --> 01:07:55.501
they talk to them on the phone,

01:07:55.502 --> 01:07:57.504
they just don't go on and
on, rejecting like you,

01:07:57.505 --> 01:07:59.339
"No, no, no, not this".

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:03.010
My point is not getting
married and staying single

01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:05.580
is the biggest loser you can be.

but when I did say yes...

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.001
I didn't say yes, I said, "Yes,
I guess", when he asked me.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:29.435
PETE: "Yeah, I guess," you
said. You didn't say yes.

01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:30.303
He's like, "Will you
marry me?" and I'm like...

01:08:30.304 --> 01:08:31.571
PETE: You said, "I'm gonna throw up",

01:08:31.572 --> 01:08:32.573
and then you said, "Yeah, I guess".

01:08:32.573 --> 01:08:34.439
But I did marry him twice.

01:08:34.441 --> 01:08:36.609
One Catholic wedding and one Sikh wedding.

01:08:36.611 --> 01:08:38.377
Yeah, we did two weddings.

01:08:38.379 --> 01:08:41.015

beginning of our compromise.

Pete's Catholic, so we said
that our kids will be baptized.

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:58.599
And I negotiated the communion,

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.434
- but I couldn't get confirmation.
- Confirmation.

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:02.636

01:09:02.636 --> 01:09:04.305

I'm still hoping we can
open up that conversation

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:12.578
and continue the negotiation down the road.

don't... after doing all this,

want that, but I don't need...

Mom, what would you think if I ended
up with a girl who wasn't Indian,

01:18:40.213 --> 01:18:44.016
but she's Indian in
every way that you want?

01:18:44.017 --> 01:18:46.653
She has a beautiful family and
she's a family-oriented person,

01:18:46.654 --> 01:18:49.989

just not being Indian?

fall in love with, my dear.
