- "Why were you
afraid, Lily?" said Jim.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.624
"I was afraid that
you would reject me

02:38.626 --> 02:42.194
"like all the others
do," said Lily.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.997
Then Lily and Jim hug each other

02:44.999 --> 02:47.866
and never let go.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.401
The end.

02:54.774 --> 02:55.974
- Good.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.476
That was good.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.778
Comments.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.582
- I really felt the bond
between Lily and Jim.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.983
It was very real.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.885
- Thank you.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.920
- Good.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.421
Anyone else?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.089
- Basically, the whole story's
about society's expectations

03:11.091 --> 03:14.126
on love and how we
deal with it and...

03:14.128 --> 03:16.061
Basically, that's it.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.063
- That's what I was going for.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.133
- Yeah, good, good.

03:21.135 --> 03:23.068
What about you, Doug?

03:26.673 --> 03:29.508
- God, that fucking sucked.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.710
The story couldn't
have been any more

03:31.712 --> 03:35.581
contrived and just phony.

03:35.583 --> 03:40.285
And what do you know about
love, you pretentious moron?

03:40.287 --> 03:44.957
Do all your experiences
come from watching sitcoms?

03:44.959 --> 03:48.760
God, it just makes me
wanna, like, Ralph!

03:54.267 --> 03:56.168
- Doug!
Doug! Doug! Doug!

03:56.170 --> 03:58.036
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!

03:58.038 --> 04:01.240
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
- Doug.

04:02.141 --> 04:04.109
Doug?

04:05.311 --> 04:07.613
- Everything was said.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.949
- Good.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.852
Now, on that note,

04:13.854 --> 04:16.922
I have a special treat
for you folks today:

04:17.357 --> 04:18.957
The final assignment.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.125
We'll pass it around now.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.229
Read it, and I'll answer
questions next class.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.021
- I just have
a lot of papers to grade.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.256
- I just want to see you more.

04:51.758 --> 04:54.192
When will I see you, then?

04:54.194 --> 04:56.461
- Um, maybe this weekend.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.396
- Okay.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.664
- Okay. I'll call you, but...

04:58.666 --> 04:59.731
I have to go, okay?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.733
- Okay.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.641
- Hey! Stephanie!

05:11.210 --> 05:12.844
Hey, Steph.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.112
- Oh, hi, Doug.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.014
- Hey, how's your...

05:22.922 --> 05:24.122
- What's up?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.257
- Thank you.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.592
My fiction seminar
was cancelled.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.227
- That's too bad.

05:29.762 --> 05:30.962
Hey, I gotta get to class.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.097
- I'll roll with you.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.699
- Okay. Cool.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.707
- So I just want to let you know

05:41.709 --> 05:44.609
that Wednesday is
gonna be my last day.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.511
- Wait, you're quitting?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.080
- Yeah, sorry about that.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.816
My boyfriend's band got
this gig in San Fran,

05:50.818 --> 05:53.352
and I'm driving up there
with him on Thursday.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.753
So, yeah.

06:52.678 --> 06:53.678
- Doug? Doug.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.980
There you are.

06:55.916 --> 06:59.217
Hi. It's so, God, dark in here.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.454
Did Gretchen even
clean your room yet?

07:03.122 --> 07:05.257
- I don't know.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.391
- Don't get me started on her.

07:06.393 --> 07:09.227
She is not the brightest
bulb in the box.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.364
- How are you, Mom?

07:12.366 --> 07:14.299
- Well, I've been
running around all day.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.534
I mean, the florist called.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.802
He was running late.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.670
And then Gretchen broke
another one of my plates

07:18.672 --> 07:20.038
and blames it on the dog.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.239
Right?

07:21.241 --> 07:23.542
- I love you, too, Mom.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.710
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.078
I'm just a little frazzled.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.247
What's going on with your hair?

07:30.184 --> 07:31.917
It's very dusty in here, okay?

07:31.919 --> 07:33.051
And what's the matter?

07:33.053 --> 07:34.719
You seem... pooped?

07:35.254 --> 07:37.222
- Janice quit.

07:37.657 --> 07:38.824
- Great.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.146
This is not what
I need right now.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.094
Oh, I have to get that.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.496
The painter's
supposed to be coming,

07:44.498 --> 07:45.597
and, you know, we're...

07:45.599 --> 07:46.698
Gretchen!

07:46.700 --> 07:49.201
Can you please answer the phone?

08:00.213 --> 08:02.080
- Hey, what's up?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.051
How are you doing?

08:12.358 --> 08:13.892
Okay.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.828
I miss you.

08:55.434 --> 08:56.468
- Oh.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.602
- Thank you.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.070
- Slow it down, Turbo.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.972
- Jackass.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.315
- Says here you want to be
a video game programmer?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.284
- Yeah.

09:15.454 --> 09:19.190
- That's... different.

09:23.663 --> 09:27.032
Ah, my brother-in-law went
to the same high school.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.366
- All right.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.535
Go, Humpbacks!

09:36.375 --> 09:39.644
- So, what have you been
doing in the meantime?

09:40.146 --> 09:43.148
- I've been pursuing
my associate's degree.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.184
- For five years.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.722
Listen, I'm gonna be
honest with you...

09:51.791 --> 09:52.924
- Scott.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.459
- Scott.

09:55.194 --> 09:58.597
Your academic record is,

09:58.599 --> 10:00.165
well, it's less than stellar.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.066
- What?

10:01.068 --> 10:02.634
What about my SAT scores?

10:02.636 --> 10:03.668
- Yes.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.170
They're quite good.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.205
But that was high school.

10:07.974 --> 10:11.176
- Alright, I admit it, I've
had a rough couple of years.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.878
But I'm ready to
buckle down, you know?

10:14.513 --> 10:16.481
"Seize the moment."

10:17.116 --> 10:19.618
You guys got, like,
financial aid, right?

10:19.620 --> 10:23.722
Like... pretty lucrative
for your students, huh?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.124
- I really don't think

10:26.126 --> 10:28.159
that this would be the
right school for you,

10:28.161 --> 10:31.329
but I can offer
you some brochures

10:31.331 --> 10:35.367
to some less
discriminating universities

10:35.369 --> 10:39.404
that would be perfectly
suited for someone like you.

10:42.675 --> 10:43.842
- You know what?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.443
Fuck this.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.534
Hey.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.237
Hey, you're looking for
a new driver, right?

11:12.239 --> 11:13.438
- Uh, yeah.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.607
- You're Doug?

11:16.776 --> 11:17.709
I'm Scott.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.310
Scott Lane.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.014
- Hi.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.550
- So how many times a week?

11:25.552 --> 11:27.519
- Four times a week.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.022
- And what, like, nine to...

11:31.024 --> 11:32.791
- Who's this?

11:33.826 --> 11:35.393
- I'm Scott.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.729
I can start as
early as tomorrow.

11:39.398 --> 11:42.867
- Well, if your driving
record checks out.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.936
- Great. I'll call you.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.571
Sorry.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.977
- I don't like him.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.897
- Mom!

12:17.169 --> 12:19.604
- Sorry I was late, man.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.740
Being on time's not...

12:21.742 --> 12:24.042
It's not really my thing.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.114
So, what's your major?

12:29.116 --> 12:29.948
- Theatre.

12:29.950 --> 12:30.849
- Cool.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.283
Sounds like fun.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.418
- Uh-huh.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.020
- Be the next Judy Garland, huh?

12:38.023 --> 12:41.359
You know, I was in a play once

12:41.361 --> 12:45.263
in high school, and they
made us dance the Charleston.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.966
It's like the
stupidest dance ever.

12:48.567 --> 12:51.269
You ever had to
dance the Charleston?

12:53.140 --> 12:54.305
You want the radio on?

12:54.840 --> 12:56.608
- No.

13:05.751 --> 13:07.852
What are you staring at?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.321
- I'm thinking.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.891
Watch the road, please.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.159
- Damn.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.633
- Where are you from?

13:21.635 --> 13:22.901
- Vegas.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.502
- Really?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.671
My dad was gonna take me,

13:26.673 --> 13:28.940
but he didn't get the chance.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.675
Is it cool?

13:31.143 --> 13:32.911
- Yeah.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.114
It is.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.497
Alright.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.099
This is where you get off.

13:57.603 --> 14:00.471
- You need to unlock me.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.106
- Oh.

14:02.741 --> 14:05.076
- Press the right button

14:05.078 --> 14:08.246
that's inside the
steering wheel.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.083
Left.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.651
- Right.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.756
- What'd I just do?

14:18.758 --> 14:22.660
- You reset my radio stations.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.295
- Are you kidding?

14:24.297 --> 14:26.931
I can't tell if
you're kidding or not.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.068
Well, do you need any
help getting inside?

14:30.070 --> 14:30.902
- I'm fine.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.904
I got it from here.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.944
- Have a good day at
school, sugarplum!

15:03.135 --> 15:04.702
Hey.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.546
Be right there.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.618
I have to be there.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.222
I don't care.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.757
I'm coming.

15:33.465 --> 15:37.902
- "I fucking trusted you,
and this is how you repay me?

15:37.904 --> 15:40.972
"By fucking my
girl?" said Martin.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.309
"I'll show you trust,"
replied Michael angrily.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.011
Then Michael picked up a
hammer and beat Martin's skull

15:47.013 --> 15:49.881
until it was a bloody
mess on the floor.

15:49.883 --> 15:50.949
- Huh.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.583
- Then Jane entered
room topless,

15:52.585 --> 15:54.185
with a towel around her waist.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.486
She looked at the
mangled corpse,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.188
then at Michael and said,

15:57.190 --> 15:59.857
"Thank you for
killing that bastard.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.592
"You're a man.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.928
"Let's fuck."

16:08.400 --> 16:11.069
- I've gotta go to
French class meet-up tonight.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.737
- If you're not
doing anything after,

16:12.739 --> 16:16.774
you wanna practice
some French kissing?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.776
- What?

16:19.244 --> 16:20.845
- Nevermind.

16:20.847 --> 16:24.248
We still on for a study
sesh Saturday night?

16:24.250 --> 16:25.016
- Sure.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.185
- Doug. Listen, man.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.654
We got a problem.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.290
- Stephanie, this is Scott.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.491
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.158
- I'm Stephanie.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.426
- Uh, look, man.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.196
Something's come up, and
I've gotta go to Vegas.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.664
- Is everything okay?

16:39.666 --> 16:43.401
- Uh, yeah, it's like
a personal family thing

16:43.403 --> 16:44.969
I gotta take care of.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.704
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.640
I'll find someone to take over.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.610
- I don't really have a car.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.780
So, remember how
you were saying that

16:55.782 --> 16:58.249
you wanna go to Vegas?

16:59.151 --> 17:00.551
I could drive you there.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.619
Show you around.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.388
It'll be such a good time.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.388
- I don't know.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.023
- Oh, come on, Doug.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.692
You're always
talking about Vegas.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.395
- I just met you.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.564
- Doug, I know
you don't know me,

17:13.566 --> 17:16.501
and I know this is,
like, a huge favor,

17:16.502 --> 17:20.538
but please, this would
really help me out.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.373
- And I'll go with you.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.008
- There's plenty
of room in the van.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.710
It'll be a party.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.479
- I'll have to think about it.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.015
- You gotta think about it.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.985
He's gotta think about it.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.387
- Okay. Think about it.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.455
- Bye, Stephanie.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.790
Thanks for walking with me.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.425
- See ya.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.325
- Alright, captain.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.694
Come on, let's get you home.

17:47.934 --> 17:52.036
- I don't trust this
Scott character.

17:53.439 --> 17:57.809
- I just... I wanna
see Vegas before I die.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.811
Dad would let me go.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.312
- Don't be so dramatic.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.381
And no, your father would
not allow you to run off

18:03.383 --> 18:06.150
to Las Vegas with
a total stranger!

18:06.585 --> 18:09.220
Honey, if you want to
go, we'll set a trip up.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.121
Okay?

18:10.123 --> 18:11.556
We'll see the Hoover Dam.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.392
- I don't want to
go to Vegas with my mom.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.194
I'm not a child.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.397
And you said yourself
I need to get out more.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.432
- What? This is different.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.067
This is not going to the mall.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.070
This is Las Vegas.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.474
I mean, what are you
gonna do there, anyway?

18:29.476 --> 18:33.277
I mean, this place is not
made for someone like you.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.146
Trust me.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.985
It's just... It's
not, it's not g...

18:40.987 --> 18:45.156
It's, it's settled.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.160
We'll be having
chicken again tonight.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.863
I hope that's okay with you.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.869
So the schedule

18:57.871 --> 18:59.537
this year, that's why
so many say yes #9,

18:59.539 --> 19:01.639
yes worthy of being
a top 10 team,

19:01.641 --> 19:03.608
but without a signature
non-conference game

19:03.610 --> 19:05.610
and playing that schedule,
what can we make?

19:05.612 --> 19:07.111
Yeah?

19:07.113 --> 19:08.446
- Yo, Scott.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.981
- Hey, Doug.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.182
What's up?

19:11.184 --> 19:14.652
- Hey, do you still
need a ride to Vegas?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.854
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.390
- Great. I'm down.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.992
- Thanks, man.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.060
Dude, we're gonna
have so much fun.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.630
Like, Stephanie's
gonna be thrilled.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.665
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:33.372 --> 19:36.240
- Many species of tortoises
are sexually dimorphic,

19:36.242 --> 19:38.242
that the differences
between males and females

19:38.244 --> 19:39.610
vary from species to species.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.778
- Doug?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.847
Do you want to eat
with me tonight?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.016
- I have plans.

19:45.484 --> 19:48.252
- In some species,
males have a longer,

19:48.254 --> 19:50.755
more protruding neck length.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.041
You fucking bastard.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.811
You said you wouldn't leave me.

20:14.513 --> 20:17.748
You said you would
never leave me.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.652
I should flush you
down the toilet.

20:25.123 --> 20:26.324
That's what I should do.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.693
I should flush you
right down the toilet.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.334
Gretchen!

20:36.336 --> 20:39.237
Can you please
come clean this up?

20:47.879 --> 20:49.780
- I can't believe
your mom's letting you do this.

20:49.782 --> 20:50.681
- Yeah.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.949
Me neither.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.453
- So, if you
don't mind me asking...

20:56.388 --> 20:59.624
- You want to
ask about my disability.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.994
I really don't talk about it.

21:02.996 --> 21:05.696
- Are you a virgin?

21:06.431 --> 21:08.866
- I have osteodystrophy.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.636
Actually, I have a rare,

21:11.638 --> 21:14.872
non-progressive form of it.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.042
- So you're saying
you're a virgin.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.678
Non-progressive, so...

21:20.680 --> 21:21.912
It doesn't get worse.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.114
- Mhmm.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.282
- Sounds like you
got lucky, to me.

21:24.284 --> 21:28.085
- Well, I actually
don't know what it is.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.288
I'm one of the few
people that has it.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.957
It's extremely rare.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.459
- Were you born with it?

21:35.461 --> 21:37.061
- Yup.

21:37.963 --> 21:41.098
- You know, if you want, you
can ask something about me.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.001
- Why would I want to
ask something about you?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.503
You're normal.

21:45.505 --> 21:49.307
- This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever said about me.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.814
- Hey, it's Stephanie.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.916
Uh, just in the van.
- So...

21:58.918 --> 22:00.618
What's going on
with your family?

22:00.620 --> 22:01.786
- Oh.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.054
Man, it's not really
a family thing.

22:03.056 --> 22:05.656
It's more of a friend
who's like family.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.292
I don't know, it's complicated.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.494
What's up with your family?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.396
What's your dad do?

22:13.198 --> 22:15.166
- My dad is dead.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.867
- Call me back
when you get this, I guess.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.069
I love you.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.570
Bye.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.909
What are you guys talking about?

22:24.911 --> 22:26.143
- Manly things.

22:26.145 --> 22:30.214
Beards and chainsaws
and penises and such.

22:30.216 --> 22:32.516
- Okay, nevermind.

Hey.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.932
Wake up.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.201
- I miss the pool.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.136
- You can swim?

23:59.138 --> 24:00.871
- I could float.

24:01.406 --> 24:04.775
I can even walk around
the shallow end a little.

24:05.477 --> 24:09.713
Just less gravity
under the water.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.148
- You did this as a kid?

24:11.150 --> 24:15.085
- I used to spend hours
and hours in the pool,

24:15.087 --> 24:18.422
until my hands got all wrinkly.

24:19.057 --> 24:23.160
I just felt so free.

24:26.631 --> 24:30.868
- Hey, you know, the hotel
we're going to will have a pool.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.903
We can... We can go for a swim.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.905
I'll help you out.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.908
- I haven't been able to do that

24:37.910 --> 24:42.179
for a very long time.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.819
- Hey, are you guys hungry?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.921
- Yeah, I think I could eat.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.056
What about you?

24:52.058 --> 24:53.224
- Yeah.

25:08.907 --> 25:11.141
- There you go, hun.

25:19.851 --> 25:20.618
Hi, guys.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.453
What can I get ya?

25:22.888 --> 25:25.523
- I'll get the
number three, please.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.526
- I'll have the
Big Texas burger.

25:29.327 --> 25:31.862
- And what can I get for him?

25:33.698 --> 25:36.166
- I don't know, Ethel.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.002
Why don't you ask him?

25:39.337 --> 25:43.574
- Can I get a number
one with extra bacon?

25:44.242 --> 25:48.979
- Okay, a number one, no bacon.

25:51.516 --> 25:54.618
- Can I get extra bacon?

25:54.620 --> 25:55.419
- Right.

25:55.421 --> 25:58.422
Number one, no bacon.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.829
- He wants extra bacon.

26:06.765 --> 26:08.065
And a round of waters, please.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.700
Thank you.

26:17.642 --> 26:19.777
Must get annoying, huh?

26:19.779 --> 26:24.448
- It happens all the time.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.996
- Well, this burger
tastes like shit.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.136
You alright?

26:51.543 --> 26:53.310
- Sorry.

26:55.714 --> 26:59.049
Can you... Can you
cut it up for me?

26:59.051 --> 27:00.784
- Yeah, sure thing, man.

27:09.027 --> 27:10.794
- Thank you.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.763
- No worries.

27:17.402 --> 27:19.503
- You're a natural.

27:22.707 --> 27:25.509
- Cut a thing or two in my life.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.881
- When's the last time
you washed your hands?

27:30.883 --> 27:32.583
- Relax.

27:32.585 --> 27:34.985
I haven't masturbated
since this morning.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.923
- And on that note, I'm
gonna go make a phone call.

27:45.497 --> 27:50.067
- I have to stay proactive
on not getting sick.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.137
I can't cough up mucus so well.

27:53.139 --> 27:56.507
My lungs can fill up.

27:57.275 --> 27:59.243
- Mucus and lung fluid.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.445
Thanks for sharing.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.147
- heard from you.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.382
Call me back when you get this.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.351
Or text me or something.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.987
- Jesus, this knife is terrible.

28:10.822 --> 28:12.389
Hey, Ethel?

28:13.058 --> 28:16.393
Can we get a new
knife over here?

28:16.395 --> 28:19.797
Particularly one
that... cuts things?

28:19.799 --> 28:21.632
Thank you!

28:21.634 --> 28:24.368
- Can you not make a
big deal out of it?

28:24.370 --> 28:26.236
- I'm just trying to
help you out, man.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.739
- I don't need your help.

28:28.741 --> 28:31.709
I just want to be treated
like everyone else.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.444
- No, you don't.

28:33.446 --> 28:36.013
You love being treated special.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.881
So what, when someone
holds a door open for you,

28:37.883 --> 28:39.950
they're treating you like a kid?

28:39.952 --> 28:41.785
And when they don't,
they're an asshole?

28:41.787 --> 28:43.220
Is that how it works?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.955
And at the same time, you
claim you want to be treated

28:44.957 --> 28:49.560
like everyone else, but
what you fail to realize

28:50.328 --> 28:52.896
is that the longer you focus
on trying to be normal,

28:52.898 --> 28:54.231
the longer it's gonna
take you to realize

28:54.233 --> 28:56.734
that nobody's normal, Doug.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.204
How's that?

29:04.642 --> 29:06.376
- Thank you.

29:07.178 --> 29:08.712
- Stop thanking me all the time.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.881
You're sucking all
the fun out of it.

29:19.724 --> 29:21.158
- What'd I miss?

29:22.427 --> 29:24.595
- Can't divulge that
information, ma'am.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.997
It's a government secret thing.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.365
We told you, we'd
have to kill ya.

29:28.367 --> 29:32.603
And Doug doesn't wanna have to do that.
Look at him.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.838
- Actually, I believe there's
an implied PRIV clause

29:34.840 --> 29:36.273
regarding Las Vegas.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.342
You know what they say.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.011
- I'm sorry, what do they say?

29:41.013 --> 29:44.181
- "What happens in
Vegas, stays in Vegas."

29:45.383 --> 29:47.251
- Who the hell says that?

29:47.253 --> 29:48.952
- It's a saying.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.121
- From who?

29:51.123 --> 29:52.623
- People. People say that.

29:52.625 --> 29:56.293
- I've lived in Vegas for years,
and I've never heard that.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.395
- Seriously?

29:58.897 --> 30:00.264
Fuck you.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.766
- So, who you out there calling?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.469
- Um, my boyfriend.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.904
He wasn't answering, though.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.806
- Boyfriend, huh?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.408
Sounds serious.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.077
- Yeah, it's getting
pretty serious.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.280
- He's a professor.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.248
- And the plot thickens.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.385
So, why pray tell, are you
making study dates with Doug

30:21.387 --> 30:23.353
if you're already
doing the professor?

30:23.355 --> 30:26.456
Doesn't that, like,
guarantee a passing grade?

30:26.458 --> 30:28.392
- It's not like that.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.460
He's a great guy.

30:30.462 --> 30:34.298
- I heard he sleeps with
a lot of his students.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.669
- He doesn't do that anymore.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.479
Jack.

31:56.948 --> 31:57.748
Oh, come on, man.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.583
Those are funny.

31:59.984 --> 32:01.852
- I laughed.

32:02.186 --> 32:04.254
- You didn't even smile.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.323
You never smile.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.493
- Maybe I don't want to.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.496
- Bullshit.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.700
- I can't smile.

32:16.702 --> 32:21.238
These muscles in
my face don't work.

32:21.973 --> 32:24.074
Or something.

32:25.877 --> 32:29.846
I guess it's just
an added bonus.

32:31.749 --> 32:33.250
- That's not true.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.585
I've seen you smile.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.955
You use your eyes.

32:37.957 --> 32:40.624
You just don't do it that often.

32:42.293 --> 32:46.163
- Maybe I don't have
anything to smile about.

32:54.138 --> 32:54.938
- Oh, my God.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.006
What is happening?

32:57.608 --> 32:59.376
- What are you doing?

33:01.779 --> 33:03.113
- Just having a little fun.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.382
- Slow down, stranger.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.217
- Not a chance.

33:10.455 --> 33:11.588
Say it with me, Doug.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.690
Woo!

33:14.459 --> 33:16.093
Woo!

33:16.095 --> 33:17.828
- Woo!

33:19.931 --> 33:21.932
- You guys are fucking insane!

33:32.143 --> 33:33.877
- That was not cool.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.047
What's happening?

33:37.448 --> 33:38.682
- You okay?

33:38.684 --> 33:39.850
You need some water?

33:39.852 --> 33:41.852
- Scott, pull over!

34:06.578 --> 34:07.511
- What do I do?

34:07.513 --> 34:08.445
- I don't know.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.545
I've never seen him this bad.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.108
Hit his back or
something, I don't know.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.418
- Doug!

34:14.786 --> 34:16.253
Doug!

34:17.955 --> 34:19.188
- I'm okay.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.123
Just give me a minute.

34:21.692 --> 34:23.159
- Oh my God.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.161
I was gonna call 911.

34:25.630 --> 34:26.763
- Damn it, Doug.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.764
You scared the shit
out of me, man.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.237
- I'm fine.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.739
Let's keep going.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.119
- That was terrifying.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.091
- You okay?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.092
- I'm fine.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.260
Just freaked me out a little.

34:57.895 --> 34:59.930
- Come on. Let's go.

35:52.885 --> 35:53.683
- Oh, look at you.

35:53.685 --> 35:54.451
Look at you.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.919
You're beautiful.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.058
Hey, come here.

36:02.060 --> 36:02.993
Come here.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.461
Take a picture.

36:04.463 --> 36:05.795
Come on, I got it set up.

36:05.797 --> 36:06.696
Oh shit, I got it on video.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.064
Hold on.

36:08.066 --> 36:08.732
Alright.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.367
Say "cheese."

36:12.136 --> 36:14.337
- Are we there yet?

36:15.973 --> 36:18.074
- See that sign over there?

36:19.210 --> 36:20.744
- Yeah.

36:21.479 --> 36:24.881
- A friend and I stayed out
all night once by that sign,

36:24.883 --> 36:27.284
just waiting for a ride.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.753
- Why didn't you
stay at a hotel?

36:30.488 --> 36:32.322
- Didn't have any money.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.225
- Oh. That must've sucked.

36:36.160 --> 36:41.131
- Actually, it was one of
the best nights of my life.

36:58.115 --> 37:00.417
- It's calm here.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.886
- I've never
seen anything like this.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.788
There's so many people.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.259
This is amazing.

37:43.628 --> 37:45.228
- Check it out.

37:46.797 --> 37:48.565
We're here.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.003
- Huh.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.873
- It's cool, huh?

38:01.646 --> 38:03.880
- This is crazy.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.349
- I wanna gamble.

38:06.351 --> 38:08.285
- Slow your roll, buddy.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.588
Let's check out the hotel first.

38:16.027 --> 38:18.395
- That place looks nice.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.699
- No, we can't stay there.

38:23.334 --> 38:25.902
I know a place that's
a little better suited

38:25.904 --> 38:27.971
for our price range.

38:50.294 --> 38:51.528
- Where'd you hear
that Julian sleeps

38:51.530 --> 38:54.431
with a lot of students?

38:56.734 --> 38:59.336
- I thought you knew.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.542
- Jesus, what do you got
in here, a dead body?

39:05.910 --> 39:07.143
- Uh, just books.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.779
Doug and I are supposed
to study this weekend.

39:11.615 --> 39:13.983
So, should we meet back
here in a few hours?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.753
- You ditching us already?

39:16.755 --> 39:17.954
- I've just been
stewing in your juices

39:17.956 --> 39:18.855
for the last six hours.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.424
I could use a shower.

39:22.593 --> 39:25.729
- Scott, why don't you show
me those cardshark skills?

39:25.731 --> 39:27.230
- Pace yourself, captain.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.765
Let's check out our room first.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.900
There's plenty of time
to spend your money.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.869
- Great. Well, see
you in a few hours.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.239
- Yes, Mom.

39:37.341 --> 39:38.742
Yes.

39:42.079 --> 39:44.047
I'm fine, Mom.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.517
- Unacceptable, Doug!

39:47.519 --> 39:50.587
We agreed you would not be
going to that awful place!

39:50.589 --> 39:51.955
- We didn't agree.

39:51.957 --> 39:52.756
- Where are you?

39:52.758 --> 39:53.523
I am going to get you.

39:53.525 --> 39:54.991
- No, Mom.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.726
I just got here.

39:57.895 --> 40:00.997
- Well, are you at
least eating enough?

40:00.999 --> 40:02.399
- Yes, Mom.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.067
- The hotel clean?

40:04.069 --> 40:05.468
- It's fine.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.303
- Do you need anything?

40:07.305 --> 40:08.872
- No.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.978
- You know, the dog
got under the fence

40:14.980 --> 40:17.113
and into the
neighbor's yard today.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.149
- Great.

40:19.151 --> 40:21.017
- When are you coming home?

40:21.019 --> 40:23.153
- I just got here.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.789
I'll be home in
a couple of days.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.557
I gotta go, Mom.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.459
- Wait. Okay, well...

40:29.960 --> 40:31.461
Call us later.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.062
I love you.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.564
- I love you, too, Douglas.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.266
Aah!

40:40.672 --> 40:43.373
- What's that stain on the bed?

40:44.041 --> 40:45.008
- Don't worry.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.476
That doesn't look like blood.

40:46.478 --> 40:47.911
It looks like semen.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.145
Good luck with that.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.247
- It's your bed.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.649
Are you okay?

42:08.158 --> 42:09.492
- Yeah.

42:10.427 --> 42:12.195
I'm great.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.130
- We've got some time to kill.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.233
You wanna go see your friend?

42:20.070 --> 42:20.970
- No.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.672
I can take of that later.

42:22.674 --> 42:23.606
I need a drink.

42:23.608 --> 42:25.475
Let's roll.

42:27.478 --> 42:29.345
You ever play blackjack?

42:30.180 --> 42:31.414
- On my phone.

42:32.216 --> 42:32.949
- That's good enough for me.

42:32.951 --> 42:34.083
Let's do it.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.290
- Okay.

42:40.292 --> 42:41.391
- Here, do you see this?

42:41.393 --> 42:42.425
It's ridiculous.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.860
- Hey, cutie.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.261
- Hey.
What's the minimum?

42:45.263 --> 42:46.529
- $10.

42:46.531 --> 42:47.830
- $10.

42:52.169 --> 42:53.036
You good with that?

42:53.038 --> 42:53.703
- Yeah.

42:53.705 --> 42:54.705
- Alright.

43:12.289 --> 43:12.956
I think you should...

43:12.958 --> 43:14.557
- Oh, yeah.

43:14.559 --> 43:16.726
Please. Yeah.

43:16.728 --> 43:18.261
- Just go ahead.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.136
- Stay.
- Definitely stay.

43:27.138 --> 43:28.838
- 20, 20.

43:31.742 --> 43:33.543
- That's fucking sick.

43:35.045 --> 43:36.913
- Bust, again.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.417
- Yes!

43:42.620 --> 43:44.654
- This guy's getting
all the good cards.

43:44.656 --> 43:45.822
With a face like that,

43:45.824 --> 43:47.757
you should go over
to the poker table.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.926
- He's mad 'cause he's losing.

43:53.197 --> 43:54.397
- Place your bets.

43:57.501 --> 43:59.168
No more bets.

43:59.803 --> 44:02.305
33, black.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.141
- Alright, what else?

44:05.143 --> 44:08.478
- The rest, and then
stuck on two to one.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.912
- The whole thing?

44:09.914 --> 44:10.913
- Yeah.

44:10.915 --> 44:11.681
- You sure?

44:11.683 --> 44:12.615
- Yeah!

44:12.617 --> 44:14.183
- Place your bets.

44:14.185 --> 44:16.085
- Here we go, here
we go, here we go.

44:16.087 --> 44:17.387
- Wait, nevermind.

44:17.389 --> 44:19.422
- Oh my God.

44:27.765 --> 44:29.465
- Yes!

44:31.168 --> 44:32.368
- You sure?
- Yeah!

44:32.370 --> 44:34.971
- Okay. Alright.

44:34.973 --> 44:37.273
- No more bets.

44:38.475 --> 44:40.343
No more bets, please.

44:42.579 --> 44:46.049
- Green, zero!
- Yeah! Yes!

44:49.019 --> 44:51.020
Here we go, here
we go, here we go.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.322
11, yes!

44:53.324 --> 44:54.557
Did you see that?

44:54.559 --> 44:56.025
Look at that.

44:58.062 --> 45:00.129
Come on, come on.

45:00.131 --> 45:01.397
- Excuse me, sir.

45:01.865 --> 45:02.965
- Yeah.

45:03.801 --> 45:05.435
- Is he 21?

45:05.437 --> 45:06.836
- Of course.

45:09.273 --> 45:11.140
- Could you please
show me some ID?

45:11.142 --> 45:12.208
- Yeah.

45:12.210 --> 45:13.976
It's in your
pocket, right, Doug?

45:13.978 --> 45:15.845
- Yeah, back pocket.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.246
- He's pretty heavy.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.082
If you maybe get his feet,
help me flip him over,

45:19.084 --> 45:20.783
we get it out.

45:21.785 --> 45:23.753
- Oh, no, that
won't be necessary.

45:23.755 --> 45:25.521
I'm terribly sorry.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.990
He looks young for his age.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.960
You have a nice day.

45:32.229 --> 45:35.264
- You know, you could've
just shown him my ID.

45:35.266 --> 45:39.168
- Yeah, but that wouldn't
have been as much fun.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.971
- Refills! Hell yeah!

45:41.973 --> 45:44.407
- Sorry, it's his first time.

45:45.442 --> 45:46.275
Wait, wait, wait.

45:46.277 --> 45:47.844
That's for you.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.946
- Can I get a straw?

45:51.115 --> 45:53.549
- I think she wants the D, Doug.

45:54.219 --> 45:55.518
She's into you.

45:55.520 --> 45:56.786
- Sure.

46:02.493 --> 46:03.659
- Right.

46:03.661 --> 46:06.829
Onward.

46:07.598 --> 46:08.998
- Where to next?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.234
- Wherever you want to go, man.

46:12.136 --> 46:13.970
- Should we go
pick up Stephanie?

46:13.972 --> 46:15.938
- Yeah, let's head back.

46:21.011 --> 46:22.779
- You know what?

46:22.781 --> 46:25.648
I had a lot of fun with you.

46:25.650 --> 46:27.216
Thank you.

46:27.218 --> 46:28.050
- Good.

46:28.052 --> 46:29.418
I did, too.

46:29.420 --> 46:30.286
Especially 'cause
you're gonna give me

46:30.288 --> 46:31.288
a cut of your winnings.

46:32.357 --> 46:34.257
- That's what you think.

46:34.259 --> 46:36.192
- Oh, come on. 30%.

46:36.194 --> 46:37.293
25%.

46:39.263 --> 46:40.530
10%?

46:40.532 --> 46:42.365
- Good luck with that.

46:47.070 --> 46:48.337
- Dick.

46:51.975 --> 46:54.110
- Import prices took
their sharpest plunge

46:54.112 --> 46:56.646
in over eight years in March.

46:56.648 --> 47:00.416
As costs of both imported
petroleum and non-petroleum...

47:00.418 --> 47:04.353
It's okay to be fat

47:04.355 --> 47:06.689
♪ Not a cat, that's
just like... ♪

47:17.034 --> 47:18.267
- How do I look?

47:18.269 --> 47:20.036
- You look so good, I
could dip you in butter

47:20.038 --> 47:22.171
and sop you up with a biscuit.

47:26.743 --> 47:29.145
- So, what do you
guys wanna go do?

47:30.747 --> 47:31.881
- Whatever.

47:31.883 --> 47:33.683
What do you think, Doug?

47:33.685 --> 47:35.885
- I don't care.

47:35.887 --> 47:38.688

bar we could go to.

47:38.690 --> 47:40.623

47:41.792 --> 47:44.527
- Not looking like
that, you're not.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.697
- This is all I got.

48:00.711 --> 48:04.313
Are glasses really necessary?

48:04.315 --> 48:05.481
- No, you look good.

48:05.483 --> 48:08.117
Like, Rollercop.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.454
- I look stupid.

48:11.456 --> 48:13.055
- I think you look great.

48:13.057 --> 48:14.490

Come on, man.

51:22.847 --> 51:23.913
What's wrong?

51:25.315 --> 51:27.116
- I just have a headache.

51:29.786 --> 51:31.921
- I got something that'll
make you feel better.

51:38.161 --> 51:38.994
- Uh, no.

51:38.996 --> 51:39.962
No, no, no.

51:39.964 --> 51:42.531
I... No, no thank you.

51:43.166 --> 51:44.667
- You ever tried it?

51:45.469 --> 51:46.602
- No.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.571
I don't do drugs.

51:48.573 --> 51:51.740
- Come on, you take
like 15 pills a day.

51:51.742 --> 51:53.242
It's just weed.

51:53.244 --> 51:55.411
It's not like a cigarette with
a bunch of bullshit in it.

51:55.413 --> 51:56.212
It's a plant.

51:56.214 --> 51:57.813
It's like cilantro.

51:57.815 --> 51:59.748
But it gets you high.

52:00.450 --> 52:05.354
- There's no way you're gonna
convince me to smoke pot.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.635
When I was a kid,

52:21.004 --> 52:24.540
I used to think
drinking and driving

52:24.542 --> 52:27.943
meant drinking
anything and driving.

52:30.347 --> 52:34.984
So when I saw my dad
drinking coffee and driving,

52:34.986 --> 52:39.121
I was like, "Oh my God,
what are you doing?"

52:41.058 --> 52:43.292
- Eagle Scout Doug
saves the day.

52:43.294 --> 52:45.561
- Eagle Scout. Right.

52:57.908 --> 53:01.110
When I was in elementary school,

53:02.379 --> 53:06.315
there was this huge
hill by the playground.

53:09.619 --> 53:12.688
It probably wasn't that steep,

53:12.690 --> 53:16.625
but when you're a
little kid, you know?

53:16.627 --> 53:21.430
So I had one of my friends
push me to the top of the hill.

53:23.266 --> 53:27.069
And I would just

53:29.472 --> 53:34.276
let go of the brakes and fly.

53:49.059 --> 53:52.928
You know, I probably
could've killed myself,

53:54.064 --> 53:57.933
but it was just so much fun.

54:07.210 --> 54:08.877
What time is it?

54:08.879 --> 54:10.546
- Who cares?

54:14.251 --> 54:16.885
- Thank you.

54:16.887 --> 54:19.989
For this stuff.

54:22.025 --> 54:24.593
- Anytime, man.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.895
- You wanna trade?

54:34.271 --> 54:36.972
- This is for concentration.

54:38.842 --> 54:42.645
But it gives you a
pretty good buzz, too.

54:48.184 --> 54:50.486
- You're kidding me, right?

54:57.560 --> 54:59.395
I feel fucking amazing.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.396
- Doug, I need to
use your phone.

55:00.398 --> 55:02.064
Mine's dead.

55:04.434 --> 55:06.235
Thanks.

55:10.775 --> 55:11.640
- Hello?

55:11.642 --> 55:12.574
- Oh, hi.

55:12.576 --> 55:13.575
I didn't think you'd be awake.

55:13.577 --> 55:15.044
- Uh, hi.

55:15.046 --> 55:16.779
Now's not really a good time.

55:16.781 --> 55:18.247
- It's two in the morning.

55:18.249 --> 55:19.381
What's going on?

55:20.817 --> 55:21.884
- Nothing.

55:21.886 --> 55:22.851
I have to go, okay?

55:22.853 --> 55:24.420
I'll talk to you later.

55:24.422 --> 55:25.888
- Who's on the phone?

55:43.373 --> 55:44.473
- Hey, Scott.

55:44.475 --> 55:46.642
Shit, took you long enough.

55:49.112 --> 55:51.447
Busy night, stud?

55:52.015 --> 55:54.249
- Doug, Elation.

55:54.251 --> 55:56.285
Elation, Doug.

56:01.491 --> 56:04.259
- So this is him, hmm?

56:06.830 --> 56:08.197
Hey, baby.

56:08.199 --> 56:11.100
- I got you some
entertainment, buddy.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.803
Don't worry, man.

56:14.805 --> 56:17.339
Elation's all class.

56:19.509 --> 56:21.176
- Doug, are you okay with this?

56:21.178 --> 56:22.544
- He's fine.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.480
Let's give him some alone time.

56:24.482 --> 56:27.082
Have fun, stud-muffin.

56:40.630 --> 56:41.630
- Hey.

56:44.334 --> 56:45.667
- Hi.

56:47.804 --> 56:50.339
- Do you wanna come over
here a little closer,

56:50.341 --> 56:52.808
so I can see you?

56:53.410 --> 56:54.743
- This is not okay, Scott.

56:54.745 --> 56:56.912
He could get hurt
or catch something.

56:56.914 --> 56:58.113
- Relax.

56:58.115 --> 56:59.481
Elation's a pro.

57:00.483 --> 57:01.817
- Doug needs someone
to take care of him.

57:01.819 --> 57:03.819
That clearly is not you.

57:03.821 --> 57:06.655
- Maybe you could stop
treating him like a child.

57:06.657 --> 57:09.024
- You're so irresponsible.

57:09.026 --> 57:10.893
- I'm irresponsible?

57:10.895 --> 57:13.896
You're the one fucking
your 50-year-old professor.

57:18.968 --> 57:19.935
- Yeah.

57:19.937 --> 57:21.437
That's right.

57:22.105 --> 57:23.372
- Hey.

57:23.907 --> 57:25.707
Hey, hey, hey.

58:01.311 --> 58:05.113
- So, what do you like?

58:10.119 --> 58:12.621
- I...

58:13.523 --> 58:16.225
I like movies.

58:20.663 --> 58:23.665
- That's not what
I meant, darling.

58:44.387 --> 58:45.954
Come here.

59:15.752 --> 59:18.420
- Uh, no don't.

59:18.422 --> 59:21.156
Let's just...

59:21.158 --> 59:23.358
- Why don't I help?

59:24.561 --> 59:25.727
- Sure.

59:52.655 --> 59:54.890
- Is that okay?

59:54.892 --> 59:56.625
- Yeah.

01:00:01.332 --> 01:00:03.298
- Kinky, baby.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:05.767
Mm.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.411
Hmm.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.381
Well, at least your dick works.

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.967
- This is my, uh...

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.870
My first time.

01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:02.858
- That not okay?

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:09.297
- No one has ever
touched me like that.

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:57.279
- I think there should be a
first time for everything.

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:01.183
Don't you?

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:09.825
Now, I'm gonna make
your first time

01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:12.561

Mm.

Mm, these eggs are good.

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.965
Mm.

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.234
I said, "Aren't they, Doug?"

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.036
Doug.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.341
Scramble my fucking eggs,
you wild stallion!

01:03:35.712 --> 01:03:36.712

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.248
Oh.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.285
I need a new plate.

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:56.231
- I should probably
go help him out.

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:00.268
Hey.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.570
Let me get that for you.

01:04:01.572 --> 01:04:03.071
- I can manage.

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.473
I said I fucking got it!

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.811
Aren't you supposed to see
your friend today or something?

01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:11.413
Isn't that why we're here?

01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:12.581
- I don't know.

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:13.949
I gotta... call
and figure it out.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:15.650
- Call who?

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.819
- My friend.

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:19.888
- I'm onto you.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.023
- Yeah?

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.525
- I know what you're hiding.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:26.094
Why haven't I seen this friend?

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:28.697
Does he even have a name?

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:30.131
Whatever.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:31.466
I don't care.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.268
It's cool, man.

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:37.072
- What the hell are
you talking about?

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:40.041
- It's your dealer, isn't it?

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.509
- Yeah, Doug.

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.713
I drove five hours across
state lines to buy a dime bag.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.582
Get some food in your system.

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.118
- I'm not hungry.

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:08.336
No, I'm having a wonderful time.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:09.271
- Really?

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:10.772
Because you sound kind of sad.

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:12.841
- I'm fine.

01:05:12.843 --> 01:05:15.410
- When are you coming home?

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.445
- Probably tomorrow.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.682
- I miss you, honey.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.851
- I miss you, too, Mom.

01:05:22.853 --> 01:05:24.185
I gotta go.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:26.288
I'll talk to you later.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.498
- I did not give him
permission to go.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.600
What are you gonna do?

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:41.269
You certainly can't stop him.

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:52.080
- So, what do you
want to do now?

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.517
- Where's Stephanie?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.520
- I don't know.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:00.922
You wanna go play blackjack?

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:02.057
- Nope.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.594
- You wanna go get a drink?

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:08.730
- No.

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.705

01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:18.606

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:20.642
You're my fucking problem!

Doug.

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:31.353

Can you open the

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:39.527

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:17.138
- What?

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:18.306
- What are you doing?

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:20.241
- Taking my medicine.

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:23.578
You want some?

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.213
- No.

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:26.881
What's wrong with you?

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.217
- Nothing.

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:31.886
- Stephanie wanted
me to talk to you.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:33.354
- Stay the fuck out of it, okay?

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:36.057
- You want me to stay
out of your life?

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:39.060
Look who's talking, asshole.

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:40.461
- What?

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.430
- You go and you take
away the one thing from me

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:44.632
that I really wanted.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.601
- Are you kidding me?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.970
I don't need this
right now, man.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:50.938
I got bigger problems
to deal with.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.340
- I got problems, too.

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:54.175
- Yeah, you're in a wheelchair.

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:55.643
We get it.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.178
You're the only one in the
world whose life isn't perfect.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.746
- Fuck you!

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:01.115
You come into my
life out of nowhere.

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:04.585
You convince me to
come to this place

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:07.522
for a friend of yours,
who as far as I can tell,

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:09.991
doesn't exist.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:15.963
And now, you're moving
in on my personal life.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:19.033
I care about Stephanie.

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:20.501
I don't need this.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.602
I don't need you.

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:22.770
I don't even know you.

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:25.173
- Then get the
fuck away from me.

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:28.109
Get the fuck away
from me, goddammit!

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:37.485
- Where's he going?

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:38.753
What happened?

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:40.288
- We got into a fight.

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:41.222
- What?

01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:42.457
What did you guys fight about?

01:12:42.459 --> 01:12:44.559
- You!

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:45.493
- Me? What?

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:47.428
Why would you fight about me?

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.064
- You honestly don't know?

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.333
First, you sleep
with my professor,

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:54.268
then you sleep with my driver.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:58.339
Is there anyone you're not
sleeping with other than me?

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:01.109
- Doug.

01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:04.212
Doug?

01:13:04.214 --> 01:13:05.580
Hey, Doug.

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.548
Should I call someone?

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:15.456
- I... I need an ambulance.

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:29.303
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.240
- The sirens.

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.809
- What's that?

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:39.280
- Can you turn on the sirens?

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:50.558
- What are his vitals?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.161
- BP 140/100.

01:13:53.163 --> 01:13:55.596
Respiration, 32.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.798
Pulse, 118.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.666
- Doors! Doors!

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.603
- Get him in, get
him in, get him in.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.906
I need you to wait outside.

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:07.842
- O2 sat, 92 and dropping.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.647
Ready?

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:15.249
One, two, three.

01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:23.985
- Hi.

01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:26.487
He's out pretty cold right now.

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:31.492
- What's wrong with him?

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.296
- Pneumonia.

01:15:35.298 --> 01:15:39.467
But it's very common in
these neuromuscular cases.

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:45.900
- Excuse me.

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.586
- Hey.

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:09.123
- What are you doing here?

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.492
- I'm here with Doug.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.529
Is that your friend?

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:22.470
- Yeah.

01:17:22.472 --> 01:17:24.639
Yeah, that's Kevin.

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:29.477
- Is, is Kevin your...

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:32.213
Are you, uh...

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.754
- I'm sorry.

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.123
- Scott, I get it.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.724
It's okay.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.132
- What's wrong with Doug?

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.834
Is everything okay?

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.337
- The doctor said
that he has pneumonia,

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:59.240
and that it's common
with his condition.

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:03.110
- I am such a shitty friend.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:05.813
- I don't think there's
anything you could've done.

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:08.282
This happens to him a lot.

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:13.220
He told me about the fight,

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:15.723
and that it was my fault.

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.258
- No.

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.161
It was my fault.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.133
- How's Kevin?

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:37.611
- I should've been
here earlier, but

01:18:37.613 --> 01:18:40.214
his family's here.

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.216
- I'm sorry.

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.486
- Yeah.

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.321
- What's going on?

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:56.163
- His...

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:58.132
His lungs.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:01.836
- Hey.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.084
- Hey, Doug.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.086
- Hey.

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:22.490
- How are you feeling?

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:23.891
- Couldn't be better.

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:27.762
More battle scars.

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:30.498
- Some trip, huh?

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:33.667
You must've had some fun, right?

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:35.836
Scott showed you how
to play blackjack,

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:37.805
you got lucky with a lady.

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:41.275
- He was determined
to get me to have fun.

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:45.746
No one else even looks at me.

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:48.182
- I see you.

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:53.287
- I'm sorry about
the way I acted.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:57.625
- I thought about what you
said, and you were right

01:19:57.627 --> 01:20:00.194
when it comes to
my relationships.

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.730
- Where is Scott?

01:20:02.732 --> 01:20:04.031
- He's here.

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:06.133
I found him last
night at the ICU,

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.935
visiting his friend Kevin.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:09.603
When I left, he'd
fallen asleep in a chair

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:11.472
outside his hospital room.

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:15.976
Um, Doug, did you know
that Scott was, uh..

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:18.112
- What?

01:20:18.114 --> 01:20:21.382
- I think Kevin is more
than just a friend.

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:23.951
- Oh.

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.324
- Doug!

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:32.393
Oh my God, honey.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:33.060
Are you okay?

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.662
- I'm fine.

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:36.497
- I'm so glad you're alright.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:37.832
Stephanie called me.

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:40.267
- Mom, I'm okay.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:42.303
It's just pneumonia.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:43.604
- Oh, God.

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:44.939
I knew this would happen.

01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:45.906
I knew it.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:47.374
I never should've let you come.

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:49.176
What kind of mother am I?

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:52.012
And you, young lady, I
expected more from you.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.715
- I'll leave the
two of you alone.

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:56.684
- I thank you for calling.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.385
- I'm fine.

01:20:58.387 --> 01:20:59.253
- You don't look fine.

01:20:59.255 --> 01:21:00.888
You look so pale.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.523
Are they feeding you?

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:03.724
- Please, I'm fine.
- You shouldn't be

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:04.892
in your chair, you
should be resting

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:07.361
so the infection
doesn't get worse.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.496
- I'm fine.

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:10.264
- Oh.

01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:12.766
Look, this is empty!

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:15.636
Nurse!

01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:16.437
- Mom, don't.

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:17.471
- Oh, God.

01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:19.473
Excuse me!

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:21.242
- Can I help you with something?

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:23.010
- Yes.

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:25.279
Fill this.

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:32.720
What are you doing out of bed?

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:34.622
Come on.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:36.123
- Mom!

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:40.361
Stop treating me like I'm
a goddamn cripple child.

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:44.398
Dad's dead, not me.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.534
- I'm just worried about you.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:51.505
- I'm worried about you,

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.709
but I don't treat you

01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:58.846
like a goddamn crazy person.

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.719
Go home, Mom.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.499
- He was here.

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.871
How's Kevin?

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:26.507
- I'm so sorry.

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:28.709
- Where's Scott?

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:31.211
The friend that was with him.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:33.347
- He left earlier.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.517
- Oh, thanks.

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:43.557
Come on.

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.145
- Oh, look at you.

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:05.913
Look at you.

01:23:05.915 --> 01:23:06.915
You're beautiful.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:09.883
Hey, come here.

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:10.718
Come here.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.618
Take a picture.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.187
Come on, I got it set up.

01:23:15.056 --> 01:23:16.357
Alright, you ready?

01:23:16.359 --> 01:23:17.624
Smile.

01:23:17.626 --> 01:23:18.425
Smile.

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:19.460
There you go, smiling.

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:21.228
Alright, say "cheese."

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:22.830
Say "cheese."

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:24.732
Cheese.

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:26.400
Oh shit, I got it on video.

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:28.102
Hold on, hold on.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:36.477
- There he is!

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:38.245
By the sign!

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:40.247
Pull the van over.

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:58.032
Hey, wait.

01:23:58.034 --> 01:23:59.833
I should talk to him.

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:01.835
He's my friend.

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.938
- Okay, I'll wait here.

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.886
- Scott.

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.423
- What are you doing here?

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:25.292
- What?

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:27.428
What are you doing here?

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:29.730
- Going.

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.832
- Going?

01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:34.001
Going where?

01:24:34.003 --> 01:24:36.103
- The hell do you want, Doug?

01:24:36.105 --> 01:24:38.839
- I wanna talk to you.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:42.943
- I don't.

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.949
- I'm sorry about what I said.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:53.954
- That's nice to hear.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:04.465
He wouldn't let me see him.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.067
He wouldn't let me see him,

01:25:07.069 --> 01:25:08.802
'cause he didn't want to
die with his family thinking

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:10.838
he was a faggot.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.941
Guess he got his wish.

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:19.646
Do you have any idea
how that feels, Doug?

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.184
No.

01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:25.352
- Scott.

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:30.057
- You don't even know me!

01:25:30.059 --> 01:25:32.659
I don't even know me!

01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:34.695
I'm not a good person, Doug.

01:25:34.697 --> 01:25:36.196
I used you!

01:25:36.198 --> 01:25:38.432
That's what kind of person I am.

01:25:38.434 --> 01:25:41.201
That's why I don't
have any real friends!

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:44.538
Stay away from
people like me, Doug!

01:25:48.277 --> 01:25:49.810
- Oh my God!

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:52.412
- Stephanie!

01:25:52.414 --> 01:25:53.647
- Scott!

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:54.649
- Oh, God.

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:59.119
No, no, no, no.

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:09.530
- Oh my God.

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:12.599
Oh my God.

01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:14.501
Oh my God.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:15.936
- No, no...

01:27:00.815 --> 01:27:02.316
- Hey, Mom.

01:27:02.318 --> 01:27:04.484
- Yeah, honey, what's up?

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:10.123
- We really need to
get rid of that thing.

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:11.491
- No, no, no.

01:27:11.493 --> 01:27:12.826
I'm, uh, too busy now, honey.

01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:14.027
I have too much going on.

01:27:14.029 --> 01:27:16.029
I mean, even today, you know.

01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:18.632
I have yoga, and then I
have lunch with Gwyneth

01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:20.167
in Santa Monica.

01:27:20.169 --> 01:27:21.868
Do you know how hard it
is to park over there?

01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:23.470
Then I have to go to
the wallpaper store...

01:27:23.472 --> 01:27:25.939
- Mom, it's time to move on.

01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:29.076
- I am not going to
throw your father away.

01:27:29.078 --> 01:27:31.645
- We're doing fine without him.

01:27:31.647 --> 01:27:34.514
It's been almost a year.

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:36.250
We need to do this.

01:27:36.252 --> 01:27:39.086
That isn't Dad.

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:41.788
It's just ash.

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:47.160
We could take him to the beach.

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:49.930
- We met at the beach.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:53.500
When I saw him coming
out of the ocean,

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:56.336
I knew right away.

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:59.439
- Dad loved you.

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.947
- He used to take
you to the pool.

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:11.184
- Yeah, I remember.

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:15.656
- He was so handsome
in his little shorts.

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.591
- Bye, Dad.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:55.195
- The tortoise
spends most of its life

01:28:55.197 --> 01:28:59.599
slowly and quietly
wandering the desert.

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.002
Some go their entire lives

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:06.873
without even seeing
another one of their kind.

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:09.543
In a lot of ways,

01:29:10.578 --> 01:29:12.346
I can relate to this.

01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:18.852
We both spend a
lot of time alone.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:24.424
We both would be in trouble
if flipped on our backs.

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:29.629
We both have shells.

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:34.835
The difference is

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:40.340
I've chosen to be
trapped inside my shell.

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:45.612
For so long,

01:29:45.614 --> 01:29:48.648
I thought it was my illness

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:52.018
that was closing me
off to this world.

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:57.824
I started to see myself

01:29:57.826 --> 01:30:01.628
as others saw me:

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:08.101
disabled and powerless.

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:18.545
My best friend

01:30:18.547 --> 01:30:21.748
once told me

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:26.386
that I liked being
treated special,

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:31.691
and he was right.

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:38.465
By showing me myself,

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:45.572
he drove me to be better.

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:52.646
He also taught me to
open up to this world.

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.755
So, to this world I say,

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:04.291
"Fuck this.

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:08.929
"Fuck my lame body.

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:13.834
"I refuse to be bound by it.

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:19.272
"Fuck close-minded people.

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:24.578
"I refuse to be defined by them.

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:32.552
"And I refuse to wander

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:38.258
"quiet and desperate

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.594
"in the desert."
