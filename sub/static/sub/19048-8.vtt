00:03.796 --> 00:05.963
Hello.
Charlie Kelly here,

00:06.048 --> 00:09.801
local business owner
and cat enthusiast.

00:09.885 --> 00:13.971
Is your cat making
too much noise all the time?

00:14.056 --> 00:19.310
Is your cat constantly stomping
around, driving you crazy?

00:19.395 --> 00:22.271
[Roaring] [Glass Shattering]

00:22.356 --> 00:25.608
Is your cat clawing
at your furnitures?

00:25.734 --> 00:28.152
[Growling]
Think there's no answer?

00:28.237 --> 00:30.822
You're so stupid! There is.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.032
Kitten Mittens.

00:34.410 --> 00:38.496
Finally, there's an elegant,
comfortable mitten for cats.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.581
[Crickets Chirping]

00:43.127 --> 00:46.212
- [Cat Yowls]
- I couldn't hear anything.

00:46.296 --> 00:50.425
Is your cat one-legged?
Is your cat fat, skinny or an in-between?

00:50.509 --> 00:53.511
That doesn't matter,
'cause one size fits all.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.888
Kitten Mittens.
You'll be smitten.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.224
So come on down to Paddy's Pub.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.894
We're the home
of the original Kitten Mittens.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.563
Mee-ow!

01:04.647 --> 01:06.858
[Button Clicks]

01:47.065 --> 01:51.068
So, lately at night, I've been forced
to fall asleep to the deafening sound...

01:51.153 --> 01:54.864
of, like, a hundred alley cats
tapping on my windows, trying to get in.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.784
You know what I mean?
Thus, Kitten Mittens.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.328
Right? I'm making a quieter cat.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.247
And then I made the sales tape when I
heard about the merchandising convention.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.916
- Ooh, question.
- Mac, go.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.168
Thank you.
Uh, what merchandising convention?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.169
They're having one down
at the Sheraton. All right?

02:09.253 --> 02:13.257
So I figured, what a better place
to, like, find investors for my product.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.469
What do moronic Kitten Mittens
have to do with our bar?

02:16.595 --> 02:19.222
Okay. One, they're not moronic.
They're awesome. [Dennis] Mmm.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.307
And two, uh, nothing.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.352
Look, Charlie, I kinda like this.
I might jump in on this with you here.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.395
I think it's a good idea.
We could do T-shirts.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.648
We could do beach towels,
those nudie pens.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.567
[Laughs] Okay. It's about time, you
know, we get some merchandise in here,

02:31.693 --> 02:33.736
and I start making some
money off this place. What?

02:33.821 --> 02:36.197
What are you talking about?
You're not gonna make any money of this place.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.407
You don't own a piece of the bar.
No, but I own...

02:38.492 --> 02:40.243
a hundred percent
of the merchandising.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.245
It's in my contract.
What contract?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.747
The contract you had me sign
when I first started working here.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.707
What?
[Scoffs] [Laughs]

02:46.834 --> 02:50.753
Dee, we got you to sign that contract so
we could pay you less than minimum wage.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.798
Okay? We're never gonna
merchandise anything in the bar.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.800
But now we are.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.553
To be honest, I don't even remember
signing any kind of contract.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.555
Oh, you don't remember?
Did it slip your mind?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.557
That's okay,
'cause it's right here.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.934
I keep it in this drawer
so that you two jerks don't try...

03:05.018 --> 03:06.936
Hey, hey! Wait!
What are you doing?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.438
- Oh!
- You son of a bitch!

03:09.523 --> 03:10.982
That doesn't nullify it,
you know?

03:11.066 --> 03:12.942
Oh, why?
Do you have another copy?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.611
I... don't.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.865
I don't, but you can't
just go eat a contract!

03:18.949 --> 03:21.951
- He just did eat it. - All right.
I'm talking to a lawyer about this.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.536
You don't have a leg to stand on.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.121
Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah!

03:25.205 --> 03:27.248
This is making me think
maybe I should slap a patent...

03:27.332 --> 03:29.876
on my Kitten Mittens before you guys
try and steal that too, huh?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.879
I can see it in your eyes.
You're all over this, aren't you?

03:33.005 --> 03:36.132
[Swallows] You know,
I gotta say, Mac,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.218
my instinct to steal
this idea is very strong.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.722
Kitten Mittens? No, idiot.
Merchandising in the bar.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.724
Yeah. I'm thinking we take this
merchandising convention...

03:44.850 --> 03:47.435
as an opportunity to make
merchandise for Paddy's. Right.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.813
You know? Like, expand our brand.
You know? Make a little "mon-ay"!

03:50.898 --> 03:55.151
Who's gonna buy merchandise
to a bar that they've never been to?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.361
Uh, hello, Frank.
[Chuckles]

03:57.446 --> 03:58.946
I've never been to Fiji.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.533
All right. Well, how about, like,
hard-boiled eggs from Paddy's Bar?

04:02.618 --> 04:04.702
Green eggs.
Says "Paddy's" on them.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.496
You keep them on your desk
when you go to work.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.291
Who's gonna want to keep a hard-boiled
egg on their desk at work?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.835
Oh, all right. Then you put it
on your dashboard of your car.

04:12.961 --> 04:16.047
It's just a jumping-off point.
Frank, keeping hard-boiled eggs...

04:16.130 --> 04:19.341
on your desktop or the dashboard of
your car is not a jumping-off point.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.511
Get the hell out of here, all right?
Let us concentrate on doing the merchandising idea.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.056
Clearly you don't get it.
So I don't want- I don't get it?

04:25.182 --> 04:26.891
You don't get it!
I don't get it?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.560
You don't get it! Oh, yeah?
We'll see who doesn't get it!

04:29.686 --> 04:30.728
Okay!
Yeah!

04:30.812 --> 04:31.854
All right!

04:33.565 --> 04:36.609
All right, Charlie. Remember, this
lawyer is not a big fan of ours.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.320
So we're probably gonna have to turn the
charm up a little bit in the beginning.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.614
Know what I mean?
I got a plan on how we can do that too.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.407
See this picture of his
wife right here? Mm-hmm.

04:43.492 --> 04:47.078
What if we compliment her good looks?
That gets us off on a good foot, right?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.746
Are you kidding me?

04:48.830 --> 04:51.040
That woman looks like a stone-cold
bitch, and you know it.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.917
And he knows it 'cause he turns
the picture away from him.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.127
Well, I'm trying to
make lemonade here. Oh!

04:55.253 --> 04:57.380
Ooh, there he is.
How did you get in here?

04:57.506 --> 04:59.382
Hey!
Aw, we just...

04:59.508 --> 05:02.551
There's the man! The old-fashioned
way- with doors and feet and walking.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.639
You know, we were just having a
conversation about how lovely your wife is.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.432
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Very lovely.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.185
I was not participating in that conversation,
'cause I don't find her lovely.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.479
I think you're better than that.
I think you can do better than that.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.064
And I mean that
as a compliment.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.775
You are aware that there are
other lawyers in Philadelphia?

05:17.901 --> 05:19.819
But the three of us have a history.
Sure.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.530
We, uh- We have a past, if you will.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.116
And Charlie and I really like
the fact that you don't charge.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.577
I do charge.
Okay? You don't pay.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.039
We're both men of the law.
You know?

05:32.124 --> 05:35.543
We get after it. You know?
We jabber-jaw. We go tit for tat.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.712
We have our little differences.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.840
But at the end of the day,
you win some, I win some,

05:40.966 --> 05:44.093
and there's a mutual respect
left over between us. No.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.555
Any respect that you're feeling that's
coming from me is a mistake on your part.

05:47.639 --> 05:51.434
Then I'll just regress, 'cause I feel like
I've made myself perfectly redundant.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.394
- Yes, you have.
- I'm lost.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.564
So I'm just gonna get down to brass tacks.
I got a question for you.

05:56.648 --> 06:01.902
Does a legal document hold up in a court of law
if it has been ingested by the other party?

06:01.987 --> 06:04.363
- I'm not- - Now, mind you,
the heretofore document...

06:04.448 --> 06:08.993
had- had dry ink on it
for at least many "forknights,"

06:09.119 --> 06:12.038
uh, hereto- We signed
it a long time ago.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.040
It was a long time ago signed.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.417
I'm also gonna need a patent
for the Kitten Mittens.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.545
I'm sure you do. I was gonna ask you,
"Hey, need Kitten Mitten patents?"

06:19.629 --> 06:21.714
That's them.
I'm sorry, sir.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.799
But they locked me in a closet.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.098
Yo, dude, dude, dude.
I'm ready to show you my idea.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.933
Me too. All right,
let me go first, bro.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.644
Let me show you mine, then you can go first.
Then I'd be going second.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.730
Yeah, great. Okay, now listen.
When we're selling stuff...

06:37.814 --> 06:40.232
at Paddy's, I think we need to be
selling a certain attitude, right?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.943
One that reflects our take-no-prisoners,
rock-and-roll lifestyle.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.028
Okay.
Yeah?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.947
Yeah. Now what says
that more than this?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.408
Huh?

06:49.493 --> 06:52.828
Paddy's thong, dude!
Paddy's thong!

06:52.954 --> 06:54.872
You're wearing women's underwear?
Yeah, bro!

06:54.956 --> 06:56.874
You bet your ass
I'm wearing women's underwear.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.252
What's more sexual than a high-waisted
thong riding high up a woman's backside?

07:00.337 --> 07:03.923
Nothing. Dude, come on.
Paddy's thong is gonna be a huge hit with chicks.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.926
Okay. All right. Uh, question.
Yeah, Mac. Go.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.637
Dennis, are women gonna wanna
buy their underpants in a bar?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.639
No. Women will not buy
their underwear in a bar,

07:11.723 --> 07:13.933
but men will buy the underwear
for their women in a bar...

07:14.017 --> 07:15.643
because it's not for women,
it's for men.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.145
It's a visual stimulant, bro.
I'm not wearing these because I'm comfortable.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.439
I'm wearing them because I want to turn you on.
You know what I'm saying?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.441
You get it?
Yeah.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.318
Yeah, bro. It's visual stimulation.
Okay. Yeah.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.986
Can I go now?
Yeah, sure.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.155
I've been waiting for a long time.
Okay. Okay, I'm thinking to myself,

07:28.240 --> 07:30.199
what do people love more than
anything else in the world?

07:30.325 --> 07:32.535
They love comedy!
They do love comedy.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.995
Everybody loves comedy, right?
So- And I'm funny. I can do funny.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.331
But you gotta have functionality
with your comedy, okay?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.625
Right. You can't just go throwing
jokes around willy-nilly.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.627
Oh.
So I did one of those.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.338
You drew a men's buttocks
on a towel. Yeah.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.006
You get out of the shower
in the college dorm.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.008
They got the butt, right?
People are laughing. Okay.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.677
Your buddies are laughing.
[Laughing]

07:49.803 --> 07:52.429
And then you give them one of these.
Boom! [Laughs]

07:52.556 --> 07:55.182
Oh, that is big!
That's a big monster dick.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.893
That's huge.
That's the biggest dick you ever seen.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.687
Yeah, that's really- That's not
how you see yourself though?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.689
Now that's funny. That's funny.
That is funny.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.024
Yeah, people are gonna laugh at that.
But, bro, that's just the setup.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.402
What is it?
For this.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.611
Ding-ding-ding!

08:07.696 --> 08:09.113
Oh, it's a baby dick.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.073
Yeah! We're gonna sell
a million of these, dude.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.117
We are gonna sell a million of those, dude.
We'll do black ones...

08:13.201 --> 08:14.827
and yellow ones for the Asians.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.996
That is probably more Asian than anything else.
Dude- Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.874
Maybe a little bit more bush.
We should set up a Web site for it.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.750
Already did it.
You did?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.919
Dicktowel.com.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.713
Dicktowel.com.
[Laughs]

08:25.839 --> 08:28.632
Well, you don't think I know what's going on?
Huh? Oh, Jesus Christ!

08:28.758 --> 08:30.676
I don't get it? Huh?
Open your mouth, bitch. What?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.470
Prepare to be blasted, bitch!
Brenda! [Muffled Screaming]

08:33.597 --> 08:36.265
[Groans, Spits, Coughs]
[Frank Laughs]

08:36.349 --> 08:38.475
This is my new
merchandising idea.

08:38.559 --> 08:42.062
It's a gun that shoots liquor
into your mouth!

08:42.147 --> 08:43.981
You threw tequila in my eye!

08:44.065 --> 08:47.610
Well, I haven't figured out how to get the
tequila to come out of the barrel of the gun.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.279
But I'm working on it.
What the hell does she have to do with anything?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.281
Check her out.
I mean, she's gorgeous.

08:52.365 --> 08:56.535
You bring a woman with cans like that into the
convention, you sell the idea in a second.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.871
So this is your plan?
You're gonna go into the convention...

08:58.955 --> 09:01.540
waving a gun in people's faces,
throwing tequila in everybody's eyes...

09:01.666 --> 09:03.959
with a big-titted woman?
Duh, yeah!

09:04.044 --> 09:06.170
Frank, get the hell out of here!
Your ideas are ridiculous!

09:06.254 --> 09:09.757
Okay. Okay.
Suck on this, bitches.

09:09.841 --> 09:14.845
Huh? Huh?
Paddy's Pub stress ball.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.848
You give this to people.
They put it on their desk.

09:17.933 --> 09:21.644
And then during the day, you squeeze
it when you have any tension.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.648
Right. Oh, goddamn it, Frank!
That's just an egg!

09:25.774 --> 09:27.650
It's a jumping-off point.
Get out!

09:27.776 --> 09:30.069
All right. Get the hell out of here!
Just get the hell out of here!

09:30.195 --> 09:33.197
Don't even listen to them.
You know what I'm saying? Jesus Christ.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.533
Okay, we're stealing that gun shot idea, right?
Gun shot idea's awesome.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.704
You see any sign of that
lawyer or his secretary?

09:40.789 --> 09:43.791
No, and I don't know why you think we're
gonna catch him having an affair.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.293
I mean, the guy's wife is really hot.
No, she's not.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.587
And also, why does he turn
her picture away from him...

09:48.672 --> 09:50.589
so he doesn't have
to look at her face?

09:50.674 --> 09:53.384
Why are we in this shady motel
where we saw him go in?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.386
I'm telling you, he's-
he's banging that secretary.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.096
I don't know.
It just doesn't add up.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.348
She's an attractive lady, you know?
She's not attractive.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.016
Oh, my God!
What?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.018
The woman in the room
right next to him...

10:03.103 --> 10:05.062
she just ate an entire
sleeve of Chips Ahoy!

10:05.146 --> 10:07.523
Charlie, could you focus
on the lawyer's room, please?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.943
We're not here to blackmail a lady
for eating too many cookies.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.737
Did you say an entire sleeve though?
An entire sleeve.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.906
That's a lot of cookies.
She a big lady?

10:15.991 --> 10:18.242
[Charlie] Of course.
She's a humongous lady. Yeah. Of course.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.287
Oh, shit. I see him. He's walking towards the car.
He's walking towards the car!

10:21.413 --> 10:23.289
Get down! Shh!
Why is he coming towards us?

10:23.415 --> 10:26.083
Get down and hold still!
[Door Opens]

10:27.669 --> 10:30.087
[Sighs] [Door Closes]

10:30.171 --> 10:34.049
All right. Um, so what are you
people doing in my car now?

10:34.175 --> 10:36.218
Okay, let me explain that.
Uh- Yeah.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.138
We were staking you out last night-
kinda spying on you. Mm-hmm.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.473
It got a little cold. It dropped down, right?
It was freezing, wasn't it?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.101
Did you feel that? So we jimmied your
lock and spent the night in here.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.562
Okay. Uh, so why were you
spying on me all night?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.648
Because you're having an affair, and we're
gonna blackmail you for your services.

10:49.733 --> 10:53.027
Okay. I hate to disappoint you,
but I am not having an affair.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.362
Oh, yeah? Then why do you turn your
wife's picture away from your desk...

10:55.447 --> 10:57.364
so you don't have
to look at her face?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.283
Why are you staying
in this seedy motel?

10:59.367 --> 11:01.285
And why does it look like
you've been crying all night?

11:01.369 --> 11:04.413
I'll tell you what I think.
I think you feel guilty.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.499
All right, listen.
If you must know,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.754
my wife is leaving me.

11:11.838 --> 11:15.382
And I have to sleep
in this fleabag motel.

11:15.467 --> 11:19.011
And I am still very much in love with my wife,
which makes this divorce very difficult.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.013
Thus you have the turning away
of the photo...

11:21.097 --> 11:23.724
and you have, you know, the crying
episodes, and the what-have-you.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.894
Mmm. Sad.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.687
Okay, that's our bad.
We, uh...

11:28.813 --> 11:30.689
It all comes together- That
makes a lot of sense though.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.316
In a different way
than I thought.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.069
God, divorce is tough.
The picture sort of coming together for you all?

11:35.153 --> 11:37.029
You must be
all ripped up about that.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.073
So, um- Do you want to
have a conversation...

11:39.157 --> 11:41.367
about helping us out with
our Kitten Mitten patent and...

11:41.493 --> 11:43.369
I thought this contract-
You know what? If, um...

11:43.495 --> 11:45.746
Why don't you get out of my car?
We should go now.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.331
Why don't you just
get out of my car?

11:47.415 --> 11:48.832
You've had a hard
couple of days.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.632
Okay, consumer, are you ready to get
blasted in the mouth by Paddy's Shotgun?

11:56.758 --> 11:57.841
Yeah.
One, two, three!

11:58.885 --> 12:00.427
[Gargles] Ah!

12:00.512 --> 12:04.223
Goddamn it, dude!
You just cannot blast water out of a gun.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.974
The technology
is just not there.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.560
They did sort of figure it out with
water guns, so I don't know why...

12:08.645 --> 12:11.188
Yeah, but a water gun doesn't have
the same feel to it, you know?

12:11.272 --> 12:13.399
It doesn't. You want to feel the
weight of a real gun in your mouth.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.360
You want to taste the metal.
You want to feel the steel, man, you know?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.404
Okay, bro, new plan.
Yeah.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.572
Let's just make a video,
show that at the convention.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.157
Not like Charlie's video though.
Ours needs to be cool.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.159
No, no, no, dude.
Way cooler than Charlie's.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.161
With, like, quick cuts
and awesome music...

12:26.246 --> 12:28.914
and eagles flying through the air and
picking up trout out of rivers and shit.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.916
Ripping it apart and eating it, you know?
It's so cool.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.042
That'll excite people.
Yeah.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.544
They'll want to invest.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.587
Then we'll let the brainiacs in China
figure out the technology.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.550
Yeah. But the point is- is it's got
to really grab people's attention.

12:39.676 --> 12:43.429
You know what I mean? All right.
I did a little tweaking and...

12:44.931 --> 12:47.057
- What is that?
- Paddy's Shotgun, bro!

12:47.183 --> 12:49.184
You get blasted in the mouth!
[Laughs]

12:49.269 --> 12:52.312
- You stole my idea! - No, no, no, Frank.
We tweaked your idea.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.982
We took what was a good idea
and we made it a great idea.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.984
We're also gonna get a bustier chick.
No offense, ma'am.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.986
You're very busty.
Your breasts are very large.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.030
But, uh, we want to go weird with it.
We want to get really freakish.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.408
I would like to get your number,
actually, though at some point.

13:04.492 --> 13:09.037
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look.
You can't just take somebody's idea,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.248
change the name of it
and then sell it.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.208
That's the American way, bro.
Yeah!

13:13.293 --> 13:16.044
Yeah. Take a look at Hard Rock Cafe.
Got tweaked by Planet Hollywood.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.548
Coke got tweaked by Pepsi.
Transformers got tweaked by GoBots.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.884
Our job is to step aside
and let the consumer decide.

13:21.968 --> 13:26.221
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna get a patent
for this and sue your balls off.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.307
We're gonna get a patent too,
Frank, so screw you.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.267
Kiss it.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.689
- Knock, knock.
- Hey, friend!

13:35.773 --> 13:39.026
Hey, we got you a little something to take
your mind off your current wife situation.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.861
Sandy, have a seat right here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.656
- This is Sandy. - Yep, and everything's
been taken care of financially.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.366
She's been briefed
on the divorce.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.577
She knows all about everything that's going on.
She knows all about it.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.538
And, you know, because you've been talking
about the whole money thing a little bit...

13:51.623 --> 13:54.291
You said that we hadn't paid you,
and we felt bad about that,

13:54.375 --> 13:57.085
so we're kinda hoping that this is
sort of a compensation of sorts.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.754
Sandy does that.
Sandy.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.007
- She's the payment. - Lawyer, check
out this freakish whore we found.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.468
Hey. Whoa. What the hell
are you guys doing here?

14:04.552 --> 14:08.430
I came to see the lawyer to sue you for breach of contract.
What's with the busty chick?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.391
We're gonna throw a patent on her
and a couple of other things.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.770
Now, I see that you have a-
a lovely busty woman as well.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.063
Yeah!
We brought one.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.898
Well, she's a lady of the night.
She's a prostitute.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.735
Don't get too excited. And she's his lady,
because he's going through a messy divorce.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.403
We paid her.
So we're gonna have them have...

14:23.488 --> 14:25.072
some sexual relations
as sort of a payment.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.616
Ah. Wow. Divorce, huh?
That's never fun.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.868
Oh, yeah. No, it's terrible.
He's all broken up about it.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.162
She left him- probably 'cause
he cheated on her, I'm guessing,

14:32.247 --> 14:34.665
'cause look what a cold bitch she is.
She was mean to him.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.291
[Dee] It's a mess.
[Charlie] He's been crying.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.085
I tell you what, buddy.
I can help you out.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.254
I'm gonna toss
a frame bang your way.

14:40.338 --> 14:44.091
Now here's how that works. I slip into your
house one night while your wife is sleeping,

14:44.175 --> 14:46.385
and I ease into her real nice.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.763
That way, you're both cheating on each
other, and she can't clean you out.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.140
[Dee]
That's a win-win.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.142
Goddamn shoes.
You can't run in 'em.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.479
- [Mac] Ah, son of a bitch. - Come on in.
What- What's with the broads?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.147
You're stealing that idea too?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.399
No!
No, we're not stealing...

15:00.525 --> 15:02.025
Yes, you are.
We're tweaking your idea.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.318
You're stealing that idea.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.028
Guys-
You're stealing my idea!

15:05.113 --> 15:06.697
Can you take your ladies
outside?

15:06.781 --> 15:08.949
Stop! Stop!
Everyone stop!

15:09.033 --> 15:11.535
I will take care
of all of your legal needs...

15:11.619 --> 15:15.122
if each of you agrees to never
seek my legal advice again.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.498
What?
Great.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.833
For free?
No problem.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.793
And, you, promise not
to break into my home...

15:19.877 --> 15:21.837
and rape my wife
while she's sleeping.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.298
Bro, rape? I wasn't talking
about raping your wife.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.092
I was talking about making love
to her sweetly while she sleeps.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.470
And I was gonna do it for you, you son
of a b- All right, fine. I won't do it.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.140
Great. Now we're all here.
Let's get into this.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.808
- Deandra.
- Yeah.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.478
You want to sue these guys over some
sort of breach of contract thing?

15:38.605 --> 15:42.065
Yes. This one ate a contract that said I got
all the rights to the Paddy's Pub merchandise.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.984
- That never happened.
- It happened!

15:44.068 --> 15:45.986
Okay, why don't you
throw out the suit...

15:46.070 --> 15:48.071
if they agree to sign
a contract that grants you...

15:48.156 --> 15:51.783
50% of the merchandising
rights for Paddy's Pub?

15:51.868 --> 15:53.827
Fifty percent?
I'll take it.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.370
Deal.
[Dee] Yes!

15:55.496 --> 15:58.081
What the hell you doing, dude?
I'll just eat the contract later.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.460
We would also like to make
a patent on Paddy's Shotgun...

16:01.586 --> 16:04.796
and this very large-breasted woman who's
gonna be shooting the gun into your face.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.798
- Objection!
- This is not a court of law.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.383
Sustained!
Frank, move to strike.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.886
They stole my idea!
Open your mouth!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.971
- [All Shouting At Once]
- Christ's sakes, dude!

16:13.056 --> 16:15.307
- [All] Oh!
- Jesus Christ!

16:15.433 --> 16:16.683
[Charlie] Whoa, man!
Whoa!

16:16.768 --> 16:17.934
Oh, my God!

16:18.019 --> 16:19.603
How did you get that much
propulsion on the gun?

16:19.687 --> 16:22.522
I made tequila bullets, but I guess
I put too much gunpowder in.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.692
New deal! We are taking that propulsion
and putting it in our shotgun!

16:25.777 --> 16:27.611
No, no, no.
That deal sucks.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.905
Okay. Why don't you
just use both guns?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.948
That's an even better idea.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.200
Two guns!
Okay.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.951
Six boobs!
We're all on the same team!

16:35.078 --> 16:36.161
Okay. I like that idea.
Yeah!

16:36.245 --> 16:37.287
Yeah!
All right.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.290
And, you, you want a right
to the cat gloves?

16:40.375 --> 16:42.125
Mittens, dude.
Pay attention.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.754
So sorry, sir.
They duct-taped me to the bathroom sink.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.674
How in the hell did she get out of that?
I don't know.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.472
Next up,
we have submission 35...

16:55.556 --> 16:59.059
a potential investment
opportunity in merchandising...

16:59.143 --> 17:01.978
for a, uh- a Paddy's Pub.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.397
[Frank] Yeah!

17:04.523 --> 17:07.401
You're really sweaty, man.
Well, my eyes are really burning here, Charlie.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.403
- Start again. Start-
- [Exhales]

17:09.487 --> 17:11.279
Yeah, that's good.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.198
Action, Frank.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.617
Go, Frank, now.
Go.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.787
Frank, just do the- Say the line now.
Let me have a drink.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.082
How about a shot?

17:22.165 --> 17:24.501
What the...

17:24.585 --> 17:28.588
# This is how we do it #
## [Man Vocalizing]

17:28.673 --> 17:30.590
[Mac, Deep Voice] Paddy's Pub,

17:30.675 --> 17:34.928
home of the original shotgun
and gun shot!

17:35.012 --> 17:37.222
## [Continues]

17:37.306 --> 17:39.891
Are you shooting me?
Shoot the girls. Shoot the girls.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.310
Do shots
as they were intended...

17:42.437 --> 17:45.689
by blasting them directly into your mouth!
[Chuckles, Coughs]

17:45.773 --> 17:48.942
Awesome! I'm wasted!

17:49.026 --> 17:50.485
But that's not all!

17:50.611 --> 17:52.946
Dick towel!
[Dennis's Voice] Dot-com.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.742
Nudie pen!

17:56.826 --> 17:59.661
# All the gangbangers
forgot about the drive-by #

17:59.746 --> 18:02.164
- Egg. - [Mac's Voice]
So come on, dude!

18:02.248 --> 18:03.707
Invest in our merchandise and...

18:03.791 --> 18:06.042
Get blasted!

18:08.463 --> 18:10.338
## [Ends]

18:11.591 --> 18:14.301
[Screaming]

18:18.347 --> 18:21.057
Okay. Uh, why don't we
just take a break?

18:21.184 --> 18:22.684
Huh.
That did not look cool.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.644
No. Well, we had to edit
while we shot.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.355
You know, and we just didn't have time.
God, that was terrible.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.859
Does your cat walk around too much?
Does your cat make too much noise?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.361
Guess who just found some
investors for Kitten Mittens!

18:33.446 --> 18:35.322
I told you!
People love stupid shit!

18:35.448 --> 18:37.324
Why do you keep calling it stupid though?
It's really pretty stupid.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.367
Why do you keep calling it stupid?
But people are stupid too, so...

18:39.452 --> 18:40.952
- Hello!
- [Dee Shrieks]

18:41.078 --> 18:44.039
Hey, there he is! What's up, man?
Hey, nice tie.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.334
- What are you doing here?
- Congratulations on the sale.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.002
Thank you very much.
Oh, you were there?

18:49.086 --> 18:51.171
Yeah. How much money
am I gonna make?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.173
Do what now?

18:53.257 --> 18:57.886
Oh. The contract
that you all blindly signed...

18:57.970 --> 19:00.305
grants me 100%
of the profits...

19:00.389 --> 19:03.683
from any merchandising
opportunities from your little bar.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.645
And Kitten Mittens-
I own that.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.272
Dude! I had to get paid
by you people somehow.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.733
Well, that's what
the hooker was for!

19:11.818 --> 19:14.319
Dude!
All right. Touché.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.196
You out-lawyered me there.
Mm-hmm.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.697
Okay.
Tell you what though.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.658
Let's split
Kitten Mittens 50-50,

19:19.784 --> 19:22.160
and then you'll never see me again.
Wow. Fifty-fifty?

19:22.245 --> 19:23.912
Mmm, let me think about that.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.665
How about if I never see you again
because the contract...

19:26.749 --> 19:30.544
that you all signed
also included a restraining order?

19:30.628 --> 19:33.463
[Laughs] Which you're all
currently violating.

19:33.548 --> 19:36.800
Uh, excuse me, sir. Can I see these
supposed documents that you have?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.885
Why, yes.
Um, in fact,

19:38.970 --> 19:41.805
I happen to have
that right here.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.057
[Charlie] Ah!
Yeah!

19:44.141 --> 19:45.851
[Dee] I knew it!

19:45.935 --> 19:47.811
It's still new enough to be edible.
That's an edible contract!

19:47.937 --> 19:49.729
Right in your face!
Really? Yeah.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.899
You know, fortunately,
I made hundreds of copies of that.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.568
[Laughs] Goddamn.

19:54.652 --> 19:58.321
So, uh, why don't you all
have just a nice day.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.906
Mmm.
[Laughing]

19:59.991 --> 20:01.658
[Scoffs]

20:01.742 --> 20:04.035
[Laughing Fades]

20:04.161 --> 20:07.205
[Door Closes] [Paper Rustling]

20:08.958 --> 20:11.501
You can probably
stop eating that now.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.388
