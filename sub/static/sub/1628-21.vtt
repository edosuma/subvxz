leave her office unlocked?

Regina would never leave
evidence like this behind.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.549
Maybe she already used them
to portal out of Storybrooke.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.598
was around 6:00 this morning.

05:57.942 --> 05:59.978
They used an override code to get in.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.561
Why would Regina need an override
code on her own alarm?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.103
She wouldn't.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.360

and took the beans?

Well, we haven't
found Regina anywhere

06:09.370 --> 06:10.450

06:10.538 --> 06:12.699

06:26.303 --> 06:27.292
This was Tamara.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.469
Haven't you already
gone down that road?

06:29.557 --> 06:30.967
Maybe not far enough.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.049
Or maybe it's time for you to let it go?

06:33.143 --> 06:35.680
August was attacked
the day Tamara came to town.

06:35.813 --> 06:37.144
I don't think that was a coincidence.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.311
What if you're wrong?

06:38.399 --> 06:41.436
If Regina's in trouble, we can'tjust drop
everything else because of a hunch.

06:41.527 --> 06:42.983
Which is why we're not gonna
drop everything else.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.105
Go to Gold.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.029
I'm sure he has some kind of magic
that can help locate Regina.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.237
Where are you going?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.365

11:48.500 --> 11:49.785

11:51.128 --> 11:52.664

11:53.130 --> 11:54.245
I hope so.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.629

11:56.967 --> 11:58.503

12:04.975 --> 12:07.682
Only it's not attached to a body.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.427
And it can do so many wonderful things,

12:10.522 --> 12:13.309
like change its shape and fly
and travel between worlds.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.391
And do you know why?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.151
Because it has magic.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.068
Whatever you do,

12:22.284 --> 12:23.649
promise me you'll never open
that window again.

Promise me you won't
talk to the Shadow.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.032
-Don't be silly.
-Magic is dangerous.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.655
It always comes with a price.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.866
You're just saying that
'cause you don't believe.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.873
No, I do believe.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.168
That's the point. I've seen magic.

I come from another land.
A land where magic is everywhere.

12:45.891 --> 12:48.007
Is that really true?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.391
Because it sounds wonderful.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.226
It isn't what you think.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.562
Magic is the reason I left.

12:57.319 --> 13:00.527
I lost everything because of it.

13:00.656 --> 13:01.771
Your mother and father.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.231
Magic destroyed my family.

to find Regina.

want to help the Evil Queen?

14:24.573 --> 14:26.279
Because I do.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.947
This spell, however, requires two tears.

of a dark moment, dearie.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.818
Long enough to lead you to her.

what it does.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.221
A trigger?

41:25.692 --> 41:28.354
-That will destroy Storybrooke.
-No.

41:28.445 --> 41:30.652
I had a fail-safe built into the curse.

41:30.739 --> 41:32.980
And why exactly
were you carrying it around?

41:33.075 --> 41:34.656
She was gonna destroy us,
Mary Margaret.

41:34.743 --> 41:37.405
I was going to use the beans

41:37.537 --> 41:40.404
to take Henry back
to the enchanted forest.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.826
And in the process kill all of us.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.749
You want to discuss justification?

41:45.212 --> 41:47.373
You were going to abandon me.

41:47.464 --> 41:50.001
Or shall we discuss
a more pressing issue?

41:50.092 --> 41:53.926
Which is that I no longer
control the trigger.

41:55.138 --> 41:56.799
What are we supposed to do with it?

41:56.973 --> 41:58.929
They want us to move to the next phase.

41:59.226 --> 42:00.181
Already?

42:00.268 --> 42:01.474
Yeah,

42:02.270 --> 42:04.761
there's only one way
to get what we all want.

42:08.819 --> 42:11.481
We have to blow Storybrooke
off the map.
