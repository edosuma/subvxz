WEBVTT

00:07.273 --> 00:09.425
This is the person
who brokered the sale of the nuke,

00:09.484 --> 00:11.140
Natasha Petrenko.

00:11.505 --> 00:13.840
Two weeks. That's it.
Tshin Shan, Shanghai, I'm home.

00:13.925 --> 00:15.630
Maybe I realized there's
more important things

00:15.715 --> 00:17.328
than saving the world.

00:17.734 --> 00:18.760
Looks like we're on

00:18.845 --> 00:21.086
for the Tshin Shan nightclub
in Kowloon.

00:21.215 --> 00:24.344
Eyes on a familiar. Artem Orlov,
former Black Sea marine.

00:24.430 --> 00:26.180
Wyatt?
Mac?

00:27.170 --> 00:29.379
Satellite control systems.

00:29.465 --> 00:31.840
Pavel, they work for Russia.

00:31.925 --> 00:32.969
You...

00:33.419 --> 00:35.509
are what is wrong
with our nation.

00:36.385 --> 00:38.633
They're looking to gain access
to a ghost satellite.

00:39.052 --> 00:40.429
It's basically crashing down

00:40.515 --> 00:41.563
into the middle
of a war zone.

00:41.648 --> 00:42.985
I should be
part of the recovery squad.

00:43.070 --> 00:45.047
I'd rather my team
fetch it without a Russian

00:45.133 --> 00:46.130
looking over our shoulder.

00:46.215 --> 00:48.648
Multiple tangos in your area.
Stay frosty.

00:51.201 --> 00:52.339
Missile launch keys.

00:52.425 --> 00:54.215
Pavel traded a nuke
for missiles.

00:55.135 --> 00:57.781
Bravo, multiple tangos
headed your way.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.820 --> 01:17.626
You think about it,
it's quite simple.

01:17.929 --> 01:22.724
An exchange, your Colonel
for the missile keys.

01:22.809 --> 01:24.540
I want proof of life.

01:33.639 --> 01:35.389
McAllister, don't do any deals.

01:35.479 --> 01:36.688
There, you have proof.

01:36.774 --> 01:39.264
Now, Alexander Coltrane
for the keys...

01:39.349 --> 01:40.483
Don't!

01:45.907 --> 01:49.317
Pavel's looking for a trade,
boss for the package.

01:49.479 --> 01:51.717
No.
I mean, that's not the mission.

01:51.803 --> 01:53.827
We're gonna put launch keys
in Pavel's hands,

01:53.913 --> 01:54.998
we don't even know what
they're for.

01:55.084 --> 01:56.506
Wait, wait, wait.
"Not the mission"?

01:56.616 --> 01:57.725
That's coming
from the soldier

01:57.811 --> 01:58.819
who went after
chasing Laoshu.

01:58.905 --> 02:00.170
You're not even on the team,
Wyatt.

02:00.256 --> 02:01.929
That is a technicality.

02:02.186 --> 02:03.388
We do not leave
a man behind.

02:03.474 --> 02:05.584
Coltrane left you behind
when you snatched by Anjali.

02:05.670 --> 02:08.241
We also have Russian military
inbound to pick up these keys.

02:08.327 --> 02:09.537
It's still a joint-op.

02:09.622 --> 02:11.475
All right, so we piss off
a few Russians.

02:11.561 --> 02:12.748
That's a Tuesday
in my book.

02:12.834 --> 02:13.897
No offense.

02:13.983 --> 02:15.709
No, I actually agree
with you.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.054
It is worth the risk.

02:17.139 --> 02:18.554
Yeah, you would say that.

02:18.725 --> 02:21.094
Come on, Mac, zero prep time,
going in blind...

02:21.179 --> 02:23.094
I wasn't actually looking
for your opinion.

02:23.459 --> 02:25.357
I'm team leader, it's my call.

02:25.599 --> 02:28.428
We're getting the boss back,
whatever it takes.

<i>Speaking Russian...</i>

05:24.269 --> 05:25.651
You are a Lieutenant General.

05:25.737 --> 05:27.764
You did not come here
to read me my charges.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.222
No, I came here to kill you.

05:35.791 --> 05:37.589
A new identity.

05:40.147 --> 05:41.659
A new beginning.

05:44.979 --> 05:47.214
"Pavel Kuragin."

05:48.300 --> 05:50.660
We need a blunt instrument

05:51.112 --> 05:53.276
to wake Russia up again.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.349
You will be seconded
to Alpha Group,

05:57.439 --> 05:59.558
but answerable only to me.

05:59.909 --> 06:02.370
A covert agent
with your own agenda.

06:04.599 --> 06:08.059
Welcome to Kingfisher,
soldier.

06:17.099 --> 06:18.823
Pavel Kuragin.

06:19.309 --> 06:22.448
Katrina.
Katrina Zarkova.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.089
Did you fuck her?

06:36.724 --> 06:38.987
If you did, it means nothing.

06:40.229 --> 06:41.573
Directorate A training:

06:41.659 --> 06:45.034
forge an emotional
or sexual bond with the asset.

06:45.651 --> 06:47.331
No emotion.

06:48.206 --> 06:50.474
You know, I have a theory
about people like you.

06:50.559 --> 06:52.331
Of course you do.

06:53.394 --> 06:57.253
Strip away all the ideology,
the justifications...

06:58.362 --> 07:00.550
you're just trying
to impress someone.

07:01.611 --> 07:05.339
An absent father,
an unkind mother,

07:05.636 --> 07:07.073
brother...

07:08.167 --> 07:09.730
a lover.

07:39.472 --> 07:41.175
Confirm overwatch.

07:46.138 --> 07:48.472
We have multiple entrances
and exits...

07:49.528 --> 07:51.292
multiple levels.

07:52.087 --> 07:53.948
And we got civilians
everywhere.

07:54.135 --> 07:57.081
Copy that.
Stay sharp, everybody.

07:57.889 --> 07:59.151
Novin, you in position?

07:59.269 --> 08:00.534
Eyes on.

08:10.439 --> 08:13.099
Got exterior overview,
but whatever happens

08:13.189 --> 08:15.167
in the inside,
we'll be in the blind.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.784
I have eyes on Pavel.

08:28.144 --> 08:30.284
Mac, he's at your 12:00.

08:38.188 --> 08:40.067
Ah, my favorite Russian.

08:40.308 --> 08:41.554
Where's Coltrane?

08:41.730 --> 08:44.425
Have Katrina show me
the package.

08:48.849 --> 08:50.925
Bravo three.
Bad idea.

08:51.011 --> 08:52.519
It's okay, I've got this.

08:52.605 --> 08:54.206
Yeah, until we find out
you've been

08:54.292 --> 08:55.417
working for Pavel
the whole time.

08:55.503 --> 08:57.264
Thanks.
Just running scenarios.

08:57.349 --> 08:59.972
Which seem to involve me
betraying everybody.

09:18.056 --> 09:19.362
Artem...

09:21.353 --> 09:23.058
Eyes on Zero Alpha.

09:27.889 --> 09:29.480
What are these launch keys
for?

09:29.639 --> 09:31.440
Why they so important?

09:33.691 --> 09:36.081
You always wanted answers.

09:39.644 --> 09:41.151
Coltrane.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.464
You know this really
should have been you and me.

09:54.224 --> 09:56.401
Possible tangos
converging on the lo...

10:05.934 --> 10:08.339
Tangos, surrounded.
It's a setup.

10:10.472 --> 10:12.050
Mustafa!

10:15.009 --> 10:16.214
Fuck!

11:00.951 --> 11:02.139
Heading for exfil.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.689
Moving for pick-up.

11:06.651 --> 11:08.217
Back, back, back.

11:11.139 --> 11:13.521
Road closed.
Having to go around.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.943
Boss, you okay?
I think Novin shot you.

11:18.029 --> 11:20.599
I explicitly told you
no deals!

11:21.049 --> 11:22.044
Can we talk about this later?

11:22.130 --> 11:23.764
Wyatt's going after Kuragin.

11:24.526 --> 11:27.154
Well, get after him, then.
Suppressing fire. Move.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.693
Moving.

11:50.519 --> 11:52.193
Yeah, I've been waiting
for this day,

11:53.603 --> 11:55.603
ever since you put
a fucking bullet in me.

11:55.732 --> 12:00.560
320 Providence Avenue,
South Carolina, yes?

12:00.646 --> 12:03.396
What?
What?

12:05.232 --> 12:06.849
What did you say?

12:07.059 --> 12:09.040
It's a nice house, Sam.

12:09.317 --> 12:11.199
It's a very nice life.

12:12.621 --> 12:13.818
But if you let me walk,

12:13.939 --> 12:16.939
I promise no harm
will come to your wife.

12:20.378 --> 12:22.893
You lay a fucking finger
on her...

12:22.979 --> 12:25.498
You pull that trigger
and it's over.

12:25.751 --> 12:27.842
This is your only chance.

12:30.889 --> 12:32.217
Wyatt?

12:34.279 --> 12:35.615
Comms, back online.

12:35.701 --> 12:37.670
He said he was going
after Madison.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.217
All right.
He says a lot of things.

12:49.528 --> 12:51.881
All call signs,
package secured.

12:52.474 --> 12:53.896
Are you at the RV?

12:54.178 --> 12:55.779
No, I left the mobile crib.

12:55.912 --> 12:57.724
Those were not
your orders.

12:57.939 --> 13:00.842
It felt like closing down
their exfil was worth the risk.

13:01.498 --> 13:05.615
Remember, Sam,
I gave you a chance.

13:14.309 --> 13:16.264
Corporal, did you agree
with Sergeant McAllister's

13:16.365 --> 13:18.709
decision to proceed
with the exchange?

13:19.279 --> 13:22.037
No, sir, I was against it.
I'm sorry.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.834
The mission was
more important.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.811
And I'm also sorry
for the whole, you know,

13:26.979 --> 13:28.662
shooting you in
the shoulder thing.

13:28.748 --> 13:29.756
Don't be.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.349
Consider yourself promoted
to Team Leader

13:31.435 --> 13:33.107
and acting Sergeant,
effective immediately.

13:33.193 --> 13:34.684
Whoa, hang on.

13:34.769 --> 13:36.709
We got Pavel and the keys.

13:36.818 --> 13:38.967
You went in unprepared.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.865
You took a huge risk
which could have

13:40.951 --> 13:42.286
had catastrophic
consequences.

13:42.559 --> 13:43.756
We also saved your life.

13:43.842 --> 13:45.514
While disobeying
a direct order.

13:45.599 --> 13:47.545
You're very lucky
you're still here.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.201
Sergeant,
might need some Russian.

13:51.349 --> 13:53.756
These may be
delicate negotiations.

13:55.274 --> 13:57.099
Thanks a lot, dickhead.

13:58.286 --> 14:00.506
Yeah, Madison,
it's me again. uh.

14:00.717 --> 14:02.342
Listen, just give me a call
straight back

14:02.428 --> 14:03.646
when you get this, all right?

14:03.732 --> 14:04.951
It's important.

14:07.439 --> 14:11.224
Can you believe
he just made Novin team leader?

14:11.310 --> 14:12.349
What?
No.

14:12.559 --> 14:13.514
Yeah.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.934
It's quite funny
if you think about it.

14:17.115 --> 14:20.678
I mean, she shoots him
and gets a promotion.

14:21.842 --> 14:22.934
Or not funny at all.

14:23.019 --> 14:24.021
No.

14:25.269 --> 14:27.849
So is this it,
mission complete?

14:27.935 --> 14:29.599
Let's not crack open
the beers just yet.

14:29.896 --> 14:31.732
We still don't know what
the launch keys are for.

14:31.849 --> 14:33.889
We have the package.
We have Kuragin.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.054
I'd say this was
successful proof

14:36.139 --> 14:38.684
that East and West can work
together when necessary.

14:38.803 --> 14:41.732
Captain Zarkova, does
she finally get to return home?

14:42.826 --> 14:45.459
To face
disciplinary procedures, yes.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.724
In Malaysia
she disobeyed a direct order

14:51.809 --> 14:53.146
from Colonel Beshnov,

14:53.354 --> 14:55.103
displaying a contempt
for command;

14:55.251 --> 14:56.420
which continues to this day,

14:56.506 --> 14:58.934
neglecting to file reports
and comminuqués.

14:59.019 --> 15:00.310
Because she was risking
her life

15:00.396 --> 15:01.684
to clean up your shit, sir.

15:01.769 --> 15:02.889
Sergeant.

15:03.576 --> 15:05.514
How many other projects

15:06.013 --> 15:07.584
similar to
Kingfisher were there?

15:07.729 --> 15:08.740
None.

15:08.826 --> 15:10.474
So, Petrenko and Orlov,
they went

15:10.559 --> 15:12.295
from loyal deep cover agents

15:12.381 --> 15:14.139
suddenly to working
with Kuragin?

15:14.225 --> 15:15.230
What are you suggesting?

15:15.316 --> 15:17.185
Maybe Kingfisher blew up
in your face,

15:17.271 --> 15:19.381
so you shut down all similar
ops and agents.

15:19.553 --> 15:21.224
And they're all so pissed
at Russia

15:21.310 --> 15:23.184
that Pavel's gone and got
his own little Dirty Dozen.

15:23.269 --> 15:25.607
We need to know
about that satellite,

15:26.269 --> 15:27.764
why those keys are
so important.

15:27.849 --> 15:28.889
You don't need anything.

15:28.975 --> 15:31.053
Pavel and the keys are already
en route to the airfield

15:31.139 --> 15:33.068
- for extraction to Russia...
- No, no, no.

15:33.654 --> 15:35.232
This was not our agreement.

15:35.318 --> 15:37.014
Neither was
all these questions.

15:37.246 --> 15:41.375
We appreciate your help,
but now the accord is over.

15:41.939 --> 15:43.883
If your team come anywhere
near the extraction,

15:43.969 --> 15:45.656
they'll be treated as hostiles.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.087
Already tracking
the convoy, boss.

16:00.173 --> 16:02.024
Two clicks behind
and catching up.

16:06.009 --> 16:07.415
Don't let them spot you,

16:07.519 --> 16:09.804
but stay on them
all the way to the airfield.

16:09.946 --> 16:12.376
There are at least two other
rogue operatives out there.

16:12.462 --> 16:14.251
We cannot let them get
their hands on

16:14.337 --> 16:15.724
either Pavel or the keys.

16:15.855 --> 16:16.954
Copy that.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.083
<i>Speaking Russian...</i>

16:26.478 --> 16:28.575
<i>This is Maddy.
Leave a message.</i>

16:28.680 --> 16:30.045
Son of a bitch.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.083
I still can't get through
to Madison.

16:32.169 --> 16:34.239
Can't you send her a message
on social media or something?

16:34.325 --> 16:36.395
I'm not on
social fucking media.

16:36.723 --> 16:38.559
I have a telephone.

16:39.142 --> 16:41.958
How far to the airfield?
15 clicks.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.591
Convoy 500 meters ahead.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.010
Maintain distance.

17:55.973 --> 17:57.450
Mac.

18:10.494 --> 18:12.864
Convoy under attack
from a UAV.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.941
Move, move, move!

18:20.027 --> 18:21.487
We're heading in!

18:34.939 --> 18:36.446
Incoming!

18:38.743 --> 18:40.212
Hold on!

18:51.139 --> 18:52.868
Come on, come on.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.435
Run!
Come on, let's go!

18:59.528 --> 19:00.974
Moving!

19:07.447 --> 19:08.701
Kuragin!

19:26.521 --> 19:28.554
They've got Pavel,
and they have the launch keys.

19:28.639 --> 19:31.943
Repeat: the launch keys
have been taken.

19:40.439 --> 19:41.849
What's Russia saying
about all this?

19:41.939 --> 19:43.678
Nothing.
They're stonewalling us.

19:43.764 --> 19:44.818
And Zarkova?

19:44.904 --> 19:46.732
She'd have had her comms
confiscated by the General,

19:46.818 --> 19:47.849
so no luck there either.

19:47.935 --> 19:50.201
Our launch keys are physical.
You have to slot them in.

19:50.287 --> 19:51.381
So wherever the missiles are,

19:51.467 --> 19:52.354
that's where Pavel
will be going.

19:52.439 --> 19:53.764
Russia's gotta know
where he's headed.

19:53.849 --> 19:55.724
I mean, they could be sending
out a quick response team,

19:55.809 --> 19:56.764
snuff him out.

19:56.849 --> 19:58.014
Except
all intelligence whispers

19:58.099 --> 20:00.389
suggest that isn't happening.
There's nothing.

20:00.479 --> 20:02.037
- That's kind of weird, right?
- Very weird.

20:02.209 --> 20:03.554
Well, if Russia won't
talk to us,

20:03.639 --> 20:04.514
we're go and talk to them.

20:04.599 --> 20:05.724
Me and the boss,
hit up the base.

20:05.809 --> 20:07.184
They're not just gonna
let you in.

20:07.326 --> 20:08.865
I wasn't planning
on knocking.

20:09.019 --> 20:11.184
We're talking about
an act of aggression

20:11.342 --> 20:13.139
against a foreign power.

20:13.615 --> 20:16.139
- Yeah.
- Right, just so we're clear.

20:16.271 --> 20:17.934
Rest of you,
get me any lead you can

20:18.076 --> 20:19.684
on Pavel, his PMCs, anything.

20:19.769 --> 20:21.349
We're running out of time here.

20:33.979 --> 20:36.826
So easy to gather an army.

20:37.740 --> 20:41.232
Men willing to die
as long as the price is right.

20:43.386 --> 20:45.771
The wonders of capitalism.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.021
Artem wasn't in it
for the money.

20:51.373 --> 20:53.717
Artem would have
lost his nerve.

20:54.060 --> 20:55.990
And how is your nerve?

20:56.778 --> 20:57.863
Hmm?

20:58.261 --> 21:00.676
Tomorrow, thousands of people
will die because of us.

21:00.769 --> 21:02.740
We are making sure
Russia never again

21:02.826 --> 21:06.443
has to beg before the West,
and there is a cost to that,

21:07.019 --> 21:08.467
for all of us.

21:08.939 --> 21:10.834
And how about the American?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.764
He has nothing to do
with Russia.

21:14.175 --> 21:15.670
No.

21:17.653 --> 21:20.302
But Sergeant Wyatt...

21:22.769 --> 21:26.092
Deserves everything
that's coming to him.

21:28.389 --> 21:30.389
<i>This is Maddy.
Leave a message.</i>

21:36.479 --> 21:38.396
Maybe Pavel was bluffing.

21:39.849 --> 21:42.185
You go home now,
Madison will never know.

21:43.479 --> 21:44.998
I can't go home.

21:45.235 --> 21:46.435
Why not?

21:50.269 --> 21:51.920
I don't fit.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.645
I don't fit anywhere.

21:56.389 --> 21:59.592
I was, uh, I was in
the middle of a supermarket,

22:00.639 --> 22:01.951
and I was more terrified there

22:02.037 --> 22:04.232
than I've ever been
in any warzone.

22:07.490 --> 22:10.131
Maybe that's because
you're a shit soldier.

22:10.943 --> 22:12.045
You just got demoted.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.904
No, not a demotion,
it was an ad-hoc position.

22:13.990 --> 22:15.803
- That you got demoted from.
- But you're unemployed.

22:15.889 --> 22:17.529
No-no,
I'm a private contractor

22:17.615 --> 22:19.498
who just happens to be
between jobs.

22:22.019 --> 22:24.170
Ah, command's overrated
anyway.

22:24.571 --> 22:25.951
Yeah.

22:26.389 --> 22:27.639
Better hours, better pay,

22:27.729 --> 22:29.459
less people trying
to shoot you.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.915
What was I thinking?

22:35.292 --> 22:36.247
Madison.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.643
Jesus, Sam.

22:37.729 --> 22:39.802
I didn't charge my phone
for one night

22:39.888 --> 22:40.974
and you blow
the damn thing up.

22:41.059 --> 22:42.764
I got, like, 40 missed calls.

22:42.849 --> 22:44.373
Honey, just listen to me,
please.

22:45.269 --> 22:46.967
I need you to get
out of the house.

22:48.803 --> 22:50.513
What are you talking about?

22:52.599 --> 22:54.849
Look, I...I lied to you.

22:56.059 --> 22:57.990
I'm sorry.
I'm back at work.

22:58.229 --> 22:59.826
Like, work, work.

22:59.990 --> 23:03.490
And I'm sorry, but I just need
you to get out now.

23:03.576 --> 23:06.013
Well, where...what?

23:08.269 --> 23:09.670
Just wait, there's...
There's someone...

23:09.756 --> 23:10.498
There's someone at the door.

23:10.584 --> 23:12.615
Maddy, don't.
Don't...just listen to me.

23:20.139 --> 23:21.389
They're trying to get in.

23:21.779 --> 23:23.689
Bedroom, now.
Go.

23:38.979 --> 23:40.498
Okay, I'm in.
Then go to the closet.

23:40.584 --> 23:42.804
What is this?
Who are they?

23:42.889 --> 23:45.139
Maddy, please, quickly.

23:46.939 --> 23:48.889
Back of the closet,
there's a false panel.

23:48.979 --> 23:49.979
Slide it open.

23:52.519 --> 23:54.144
What the hell?
Do you see the weapons?

23:54.229 --> 23:55.264
I see them.

23:55.349 --> 23:56.724
Okay, grab the one
on the left, on the wall.

23:56.809 --> 23:58.054
That's a machine pistol.

23:58.139 --> 24:00.439
Directly below it
is a magazine.

24:02.229 --> 24:04.349
You slide the magazine
into the base of the weapon

24:04.439 --> 24:05.389
until you hear it click.

24:05.479 --> 24:06.764
Now take the safety off.

24:07.217 --> 24:09.514
Now grab the top of the weapon
and you slide it back hard.

24:09.599 --> 24:11.139
Slow down, Sam.

24:12.729 --> 24:14.514
It's not going in,
it's not going in.

24:14.599 --> 24:15.604
Shit, shit, shit.
Maddy, breathe.

24:15.689 --> 24:17.131
You got this.

24:18.769 --> 24:20.904
I think he's coming up
the stairs.

24:21.059 --> 24:22.014
Come on, come on, come on.

24:22.099 --> 24:23.264
It's okay,
just listen to me.

24:23.349 --> 24:24.849
Okay.
Maddy, slide the safety off.

24:24.939 --> 24:27.554
It's on the left-hand side,
you push the switch forward.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.264
You pull the top,
you pull it back hard,

24:29.349 --> 24:31.377
and then you just aim
and squeeze the trigger.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.519
Madison?

24:45.400 --> 24:49.360
Maddy?
Maddy?

24:50.950 --> 24:52.809
Maddy, please say something.

24:58.309 --> 25:01.979
You know how I feel
about guns in the house.

25:03.997 --> 25:05.325
Just listen to me, please.

25:05.411 --> 25:08.803
No.
No, I'm getting out of here.

25:08.889 --> 25:10.304
Maddy, please.
No!

25:10.389 --> 25:14.262
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Sam!

25:24.075 --> 25:26.325
It's not your fault.
Bullshit.

25:27.729 --> 25:29.700
I nearly got her killed,
that was on me.

25:47.612 --> 25:49.277
Two whiskies, please.

25:49.363 --> 25:50.643
Lagavulin, if you have it.

25:50.729 --> 25:52.543
Or Laphroaig.
I'm not fussy.

25:53.496 --> 25:55.559
So, do you wanna tell me
what we're doing here?

25:55.865 --> 25:57.740
Well, you wanted to get
to the Russian base,

25:57.849 --> 25:59.372
this is how we do it.

25:59.689 --> 26:02.340
What, by hanging out
and drinking scotch in a bar?

26:02.497 --> 26:04.639
Well it's not just a bar,
boss.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.639
It's the nearest one
to the base.

26:06.729 --> 26:08.356
Soldiers.

26:08.889 --> 26:11.778
Just gotta find an officer
with security clearance.

26:11.939 --> 26:13.028
Oh.

26:13.189 --> 26:15.965
And how do you propose to spot
one of those off duty?

26:16.239 --> 26:19.559
Easy, they're always
the ones drinking alone.

26:20.519 --> 26:24.098
Don't be so judgmental.
That'll be you one day.

26:25.067 --> 26:26.732
Drinking alone?

26:26.958 --> 26:28.129
An officer.

26:29.113 --> 26:30.240
No.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.497
No, thank you,
and while we're at it,

26:33.769 --> 26:35.731
can I please get
a fucking demotion?

26:36.019 --> 26:37.747
A demotion?

26:38.175 --> 26:40.045
If you're not careful,
I'll promote you again.

26:40.131 --> 26:41.786
Oh, piss off.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.838
I didn't ask to be Sergeant.

26:43.924 --> 26:45.900
I didn't even wanna be
Corporal.

26:46.123 --> 26:47.668
I'm not Mac.

26:48.019 --> 26:49.474
I don't want
more responsibility.

26:49.559 --> 26:50.849
You're training Chetri.

26:50.935 --> 26:52.345
That was a mistake.

26:52.439 --> 26:53.854
She does whatever she wants
in the field.

26:54.072 --> 26:55.652
Oh, imagine that.

26:58.599 --> 27:01.955
I'm just saying,
I didn't join up for that shit.

27:02.229 --> 27:05.080
No? So what shit
did you join up for?

27:06.339 --> 27:08.084
Just had to get out, mate.

27:08.432 --> 27:10.799
You know, small town,
small future.

27:11.308 --> 27:13.178
No, I don't buy it.

27:13.479 --> 27:16.697
You put on this act like
you've just stumbled in

27:16.783 --> 27:19.139
from the outback,
but you're supremely skilled,

27:19.229 --> 27:21.934
you speak numerous languages,
you have principles

27:22.019 --> 27:24.682
and the judgment to know
when to apply them.

27:24.774 --> 27:26.690
I don't care if
you are a bogan.

27:26.863 --> 27:30.353
You've come this far,
why not see how far you can go?

27:30.439 --> 27:33.682
Boss, I'm exactly where
I wanna be.

27:34.104 --> 27:37.684
And besides, I don't think
I should be taking life advice

27:37.769 --> 27:40.369
from the guy screwing
the Russian agent.

27:42.971 --> 27:44.385
Hmm.

27:45.096 --> 27:47.846
You know, it's okay to get
close to somebody in this job.

27:47.940 --> 27:50.639
Especially if they're a tall
blonde with a rocking body.

27:50.744 --> 27:53.182
When it came to it,
you would risk the mission

27:53.268 --> 27:54.838
to save her life.
My ass.

27:54.924 --> 27:56.916
Because that's the kind
of soldier that you are.

27:57.002 --> 27:58.603
I didn't risk the mission
to save yours.

27:58.689 --> 28:00.690
No, because you knew
McAllister would.

28:01.278 --> 28:03.182
It was the perfect out.

28:08.283 --> 28:11.533
Back on the clock.
Officer at 2:00.

28:13.175 --> 28:15.755
Isolate the target.
Move him out quietly.

28:15.884 --> 28:18.236
Yeah, think I've got
a quicker way.

28:20.510 --> 28:22.349
Oh, and that outback thing,

28:22.439 --> 28:24.349
it's definitely not an act,
boss.

28:30.849 --> 28:32.229
You'll be all right.

28:33.229 --> 28:34.963
Oh, for God's sake.

29:04.615 --> 29:06.346
You've gotta be kidding me.

29:15.291 --> 29:18.309
Come on.
Queensberry rules, hmm?

29:41.229 --> 29:43.135
This will never work.

29:43.369 --> 29:45.054
Well, we got passed
checkpoint,

29:45.139 --> 29:46.127
it's already working.

29:46.213 --> 29:47.260
You're doing great, mate.

29:47.346 --> 29:49.447
Zero Alpha, I finished
checking all the calls

29:49.533 --> 29:51.014
that went out during
the convoy hit.

29:51.099 --> 29:53.268
Traced one that went out
to the PMCs.

29:53.354 --> 29:54.393
And?

29:54.479 --> 29:56.099
It came from
the Russian base.

29:56.275 --> 29:59.158
Someone on the inside
is working with Pavel.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.779
Weapon down.

30:07.685 --> 30:09.639
We know about the call
that came from the base.

30:09.729 --> 30:11.873
And we know you're working
with Pavel.

30:14.482 --> 30:16.365
How stupid are you?

30:16.982 --> 30:18.322
Excuse me?

30:19.559 --> 30:22.224
It's not me, it's him.

30:22.545 --> 30:24.912
Four months we've been chasing
Pavel, always losing his trail

30:24.998 --> 30:28.014
like somebody was warning him,
until I stopped reporting in.

30:28.639 --> 30:31.779
And then we get Pavel
and we get the keys.

30:33.105 --> 30:34.145
Yeah.

30:38.174 --> 30:39.482
General...

30:42.912 --> 30:45.404
The fucking indignities
I endure.

30:45.521 --> 30:47.873
I should have had an army
to hunt Kuragin down.

30:47.959 --> 30:52.209
Instead, I have to beg you,
the fucking West, to help.

30:52.762 --> 30:54.412
It's ironic.

30:57.849 --> 31:00.599
That's when I realized
maybe Pavel is right.

31:00.849 --> 31:02.599
Russia has lost her way.

31:02.865 --> 31:05.006
What are the missile
launch keys for?

31:15.814 --> 31:20.162
Facility Aleski, an old
Soviet base in Azerbaijan.

31:20.729 --> 31:23.240
There's a stockpile
of the VX missiles.

31:23.334 --> 31:24.365
What?
No.

31:24.451 --> 31:25.821
No, no, no, no.

31:26.189 --> 31:27.974
Russia destroyed
its chemical weapons,

31:28.059 --> 31:31.514
40,000 tons, 1997 Chemical
Weapons Convention...

31:31.599 --> 31:33.474
Maybe someone lied.

31:33.865 --> 31:36.029
Maybe someone got nervous,
hid the keys

31:36.115 --> 31:37.554
where no one would think
of looking.

31:37.639 --> 31:38.967
Well, how did Pavel know?

31:39.053 --> 31:40.138
I told him.

31:40.224 --> 31:42.394
We need everything you have
on that facility.

31:43.378 --> 31:44.959
Do it now.

31:49.721 --> 31:51.326
You're insane.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.139
If a Russian agent launched

31:53.229 --> 31:54.974
a Russian chemical weapon
at the West...

31:55.059 --> 31:57.154
The world would know we lied.

31:57.651 --> 31:59.357
Britain, America would have
no choice

31:59.443 --> 32:01.264
but to go to war
with Russia,

32:01.576 --> 32:04.474
no choice but to finally
fight back.

32:04.769 --> 32:06.889
History has different eyes.

32:08.229 --> 32:12.084
Maybe she will one day judge
Pavel a hero, what do you know.

32:13.740 --> 32:15.701
Waking the Russian bear.

32:16.381 --> 32:17.966
No!

32:18.472 --> 32:20.662
Holy shit, boss.

32:21.009 --> 32:22.053
Get the intel.

32:22.139 --> 32:24.029
Bravos, we need wings,
we need equipment,

32:24.115 --> 32:26.107
and we need
to move...Azerbaijan.

32:26.271 --> 32:27.349
And guns.

32:27.482 --> 32:30.818
I got a feeling we're gonna
need a lot of fucking guns.

32:42.821 --> 32:45.131
Facility Aleksi,
it was an '80s

32:45.217 --> 32:46.554
Soviet expansion project,

32:46.639 --> 32:49.521
back when Azerbaijan
was part of the USSR.

32:49.639 --> 32:51.310
Designed to be
a military center,

32:51.396 --> 32:53.349
the main complex was
never completed.

32:53.439 --> 32:56.554
The subterranean level
was fully functional, however,

32:56.701 --> 32:59.434
encompassing launch silos
and chemical labs

32:59.519 --> 33:01.139
for the development
and manufacture

33:01.229 --> 33:04.076
of a wide range
of chemical weapons.

33:05.990 --> 33:07.740
And according to
classified Russian intel,

33:07.826 --> 33:11.736
several VX chemical warheads
were completed and stored.

33:11.877 --> 33:14.037
Categorized as a weapon
of mass destruction,

33:14.381 --> 33:15.795
smallest dose can be lethal.

33:15.916 --> 33:18.161
Heart failure, suffocation,
all kinds of fun.

33:18.381 --> 33:21.013
And if those missiles are
targeted towards urban areas,

33:21.099 --> 33:22.394
I don't need to tell you
what kind of

33:22.479 --> 33:24.014
death toll
we're talking about.

33:24.123 --> 33:25.474
What kind of resistance
are we up against?

33:25.559 --> 33:27.434
Satellite images showed
multiple activity,

33:27.523 --> 33:28.643
it's most likely PMCs.

33:28.729 --> 33:30.740
Remember the mission
is the missiles.

33:31.102 --> 33:34.553
But if you do happen
to lay eyes on Mr. Kuragin,

33:35.019 --> 33:36.623
please give him the good news.

33:45.873 --> 33:48.904
Everything above ground
is derelict and unsecured,

33:49.099 --> 33:52.059
but the underground silo
is tightly locked down.

33:53.473 --> 33:54.763
McAllister and Wyatt,

33:54.939 --> 33:56.224
you'll need
to head down there

33:56.309 --> 33:58.123
in order to patch Zero
into the hub,

33:58.209 --> 34:00.217
so she can unlock
the silo doors,

34:00.303 --> 34:03.201
giving the rest of us access
to the control room.

34:38.973 --> 34:40.099
In position.

34:40.188 --> 34:41.639
Bravos one and four go.

34:41.728 --> 34:43.143
Moving to stairwell doors.

34:43.293 --> 34:45.264
The moment McAllister
and Wyatt give you access,

34:45.349 --> 34:46.474
get them open.

34:46.559 --> 34:47.699
Moving.

34:50.268 --> 34:52.467
Oi, don't die.

35:09.099 --> 35:11.678
Let's move.
Heading to chemical storage.

35:11.849 --> 35:13.264
Zero, standby.

35:14.135 --> 35:15.209
Copy.

35:21.309 --> 35:23.577
Tango down,
definite PMC presence.

35:25.730 --> 35:27.145
Jesus, there's enough
chemicals in here

35:27.231 --> 35:28.827
to wipe out a city.

35:29.349 --> 35:30.725
Wyatt, here.

35:45.809 --> 35:47.389
Bypassing security lockdown.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.840
Patching in.

35:50.345 --> 35:52.340
Stairwell doors opening now.

35:52.465 --> 35:54.363
Moving down to
central control.

36:05.349 --> 36:08.184
The security in chemical
storage not responding.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.622
I'll get men to check
and alert the others.

36:10.886 --> 36:13.192
No, you will go with them.

36:13.896 --> 36:16.622
What happened to working
with you and not for you?

36:27.771 --> 36:29.912
Zero, hooking you
into the main network.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.693
I have eyes on their systems.

36:32.974 --> 36:36.779
Three missiles refueling,
currently at 90%.

36:39.076 --> 36:42.193
Bravos one and four,
working on your doors.

36:42.279 --> 36:43.943
They're opening already.

36:44.426 --> 36:46.037
That's not me.

36:48.639 --> 36:50.224
Engaging Tangos,
all call signs.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.755
Watch your backs!

36:53.559 --> 36:54.849
Contact!

37:11.434 --> 37:13.068
Gas, gas, gas!

37:27.033 --> 37:28.283
Moving!

37:54.358 --> 37:57.564
Wyatt.
Wyatt!

38:09.975 --> 38:11.104
Cheers mate.

38:19.111 --> 38:20.639
All units be advised:

38:20.783 --> 38:22.389
missile refueling complete.

38:22.518 --> 38:25.054
We're pinned,
priming room blocked.

38:25.189 --> 38:27.184
Bravos two and three,
I'll draw their fire.

38:27.270 --> 38:29.291
You circle round
to the control room.

38:29.377 --> 38:30.803
Zarkova left,
Novin right.

38:30.889 --> 38:32.072
What if they overrun you?

38:32.158 --> 38:35.299
Pressing.
Move!

39:10.099 --> 39:13.088
All units,
launch sequence started.

39:13.510 --> 39:18.174
Target locations:
Paris, Berlin, London.

39:19.660 --> 39:22.120
Bravos one and four,
get up here now!

39:23.782 --> 39:24.933
Zero, the door's sealed.

39:25.019 --> 39:26.361
I thought they were supposed
to be open now.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.224
Secondary protocol,
the sector's locking down

39:28.309 --> 39:29.389
due to the chemical leak.

39:29.479 --> 39:31.197
I say we go back
the way we came.

39:31.389 --> 39:32.447
Roger that.

39:35.745 --> 39:37.030
Bulletproof?

39:37.389 --> 39:38.889
One way to find out.

40:05.548 --> 40:08.166
Four minutes to launch.
Trying to disable.

40:39.832 --> 40:41.432
Cancel countdown.

40:41.549 --> 40:43.349
You need the override code.

40:43.541 --> 40:46.054
I wouldn't pull the trigger
if I were you.

40:46.408 --> 40:49.189
You know,
I sort of miss Pavel.

40:50.769 --> 40:54.869
I know he wasn't real,
but he wasn't this.

40:55.879 --> 40:57.973
Do you want to know
my real name?

40:58.059 --> 40:59.518
I already know.

41:00.599 --> 41:02.744
You're Denis Brusilov.

41:03.177 --> 41:04.627
In and out of foster homes

41:04.713 --> 41:06.877
with his older brother,
unwanted.

41:09.019 --> 41:11.224
You think that's what
all this is about?

41:11.309 --> 41:13.643
I've read Pokrovsky's files.

41:14.019 --> 41:15.639
They knew what
it would mean to you

41:15.729 --> 41:17.889
to be singled out,
to be chosen.

41:18.018 --> 41:19.764
The blunt instrument
that would not stop,

41:19.849 --> 41:21.596
that's all you were to them.

41:21.889 --> 41:23.611
But you are sick.

41:24.498 --> 41:26.432
He should have left you
alone.

41:31.059 --> 41:33.330
At least they chose me.

41:33.599 --> 41:34.814
Hmm.

41:45.524 --> 41:46.580
No!

41:46.675 --> 41:48.447
We need the disarm code!

42:11.599 --> 42:15.139
Target Alpha down.
Repeat: Target Alpha down!

42:15.229 --> 42:17.099
Kuragin's dead?
Who got him?

42:17.189 --> 42:18.447
Zarkova.

42:19.149 --> 42:20.814
You have her put
an extra round in him for me.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.650
He had the disarm code!

42:24.099 --> 42:27.731
2:50 to launch.
Zero, can you override?

42:27.817 --> 42:29.825
Negative.
They're locked in.

42:31.654 --> 42:33.053
What if we blow the facility?

42:33.139 --> 42:35.474
Two directional charges,
one on each refueling tank.

42:35.661 --> 42:37.349
Liquid oxygen meets
refined kerosene.

42:37.439 --> 42:39.239
That makes one hell
of a boom.

42:39.889 --> 42:42.669
All right.
You clear a path out.

42:42.889 --> 42:43.804
Boss, we can't let you
do that.

42:43.889 --> 42:46.286
You're not letting me.
It's an order.

42:46.372 --> 42:47.700
Now go.

42:53.729 --> 42:57.019
Bravo two,
you have the other charge?

42:57.950 --> 43:00.067
Meet me at
the refueling station.

43:01.169 --> 43:03.014
Zarkova's been hit.

43:03.106 --> 43:04.625
If I leave her...

43:07.336 --> 43:10.639
This is the mission.
You have your orders.

43:12.313 --> 43:13.853
It's okay, go.

43:13.939 --> 43:15.305
Go.
No.

43:15.657 --> 43:17.344
You won't make it.

43:18.115 --> 43:19.805
I'm a dead weight.

43:23.647 --> 43:25.461
I'd leave you.

43:34.229 --> 43:35.689
Go.

43:42.673 --> 43:44.313
Okay.

43:55.183 --> 43:56.468
Exit's clear.

43:56.554 --> 43:58.139
Headed to the exfil
and we'll standby.

43:58.309 --> 43:59.875
Over here.

44:01.451 --> 44:02.836
Set the timer for 60 seconds.

44:03.110 --> 44:05.054
I guess you're wrong
about me risking the mission

44:05.139 --> 44:06.828
to save someone, boss.

44:09.309 --> 44:10.758
Yeah.

44:11.189 --> 44:13.389
On my mark, three...

44:13.539 --> 44:16.227
two... one... mark.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.117
Move.

44:37.603 --> 44:39.370
Go, go.

44:56.689 --> 44:57.639
Zero, what's happening?

44:57.729 --> 44:59.354
Facility's gone
into emergency lockdown.

44:59.439 --> 45:01.602
The chemical leak
must have spread.

45:03.248 --> 45:04.873
Zero, we need an exit.

45:05.099 --> 45:06.357
Trying to trick the system

45:06.443 --> 45:08.193
into thinking the leak
is cleared.

45:20.786 --> 45:22.286
No, no, no, no, no.

45:22.576 --> 45:24.677
Zero, we are trapped.

45:25.122 --> 45:26.302
Come on.

45:43.349 --> 45:45.764
Lockdown bypassed,
opening doors.

45:45.849 --> 45:48.109
Move!
Go, go, go!

46:29.598 --> 46:31.594
Are we dead?

46:32.969 --> 46:35.172
Death wouldn't be this painful.

46:35.877 --> 46:38.122
All call signs,
this is Zero;

46:38.309 --> 46:40.434
missiles confirmed destroyed.

46:40.519 --> 46:42.875
Bravo three, come in.

46:44.407 --> 46:46.607
Zarkova!

46:46.979 --> 46:49.117
Come in, Bravo Three.

46:59.841 --> 47:03.176
Katrina.
Katrina.

47:03.262 --> 47:04.297
Don't move.

47:04.383 --> 47:05.851
We've got you stabilized
best we can.

47:05.937 --> 47:07.147
You're gonna make it.

47:07.233 --> 47:09.348
That would count as moving.

47:09.529 --> 47:11.364
Where's Novin?
Don't worry.

47:11.559 --> 47:13.724
Mission complete,
we all get to go home.

47:13.809 --> 47:15.820
If that's what
you want to do.

47:18.297 --> 47:19.484
I don't know if they think

47:19.570 --> 47:20.973
I'm a good soldier
or a traitor,

47:21.059 --> 47:24.726
but maybe
it's time to find out.

47:24.812 --> 47:26.859
Hell, I'll swap places
with you, if you'd like.

47:27.055 --> 47:28.461
'Cause I go home,
I'm a dead man.

47:28.547 --> 47:31.601
I'm gonna have to say no,
thank you.

47:31.877 --> 47:33.292
Hmm.

47:33.519 --> 47:36.328
That what you doing,
going home?

47:36.849 --> 47:39.179
Yeah, I think I need to give
Madison a chance

47:39.265 --> 47:40.383
to kick my ass in person.

47:40.469 --> 47:42.379
Hospital's prepped
for our arrival.

47:42.595 --> 47:43.513
Thanks.

47:43.599 --> 47:45.849
You're a civilian,
I out-rank you now.

47:47.523 --> 47:49.062
That is disgusting.

47:49.148 --> 47:50.555
Stick with it.

47:50.979 --> 47:53.570
Boss, you wanna say
a few words for the road?

47:57.479 --> 48:00.349
Could have been worse.
Let's go.

48:00.551 --> 48:02.992
This guy's something else.
Shades of Churchill, sir.

48:03.079 --> 48:04.489
Kid, I'm driving.

48:04.689 --> 48:07.054
Lance Corporal Novin
has the wheel.

48:07.155 --> 48:08.555
Lance Corporal?

48:08.669 --> 48:10.874
You've earned it,
congratulations.

48:10.960 --> 48:11.795
I don't get it.

48:11.881 --> 48:13.126
Did short stuff just
get demoted?

48:13.212 --> 48:14.853
Don't ruin this for me,
dickheads.

48:14.939 --> 48:16.656
And stop calling me
short stuff.

48:16.742 --> 48:18.219
Go on, get in.
