A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

01:58.430 --> 02:01.695
( soft music playing )

02:45.530 --> 02:47.851
( door opening )

02:47.860 --> 02:49.259
TAD ?

02:49.260 --> 02:51.296
IS THAT YOU ?

02:52.100 --> 02:54.318
YOU'RE EARLY.

02:59.130 --> 03:03.453
Time to kiss your sweet ass
goodbye, cupcake.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.658
( screaming )

03:12.330 --> 03:16.528
( stabbing sounds )

03:22.500 --> 03:25.094
SERIOUSLY, SEVERAL PEOPLE
HAVE TOLD ME THAT

03:25.100 --> 03:26.988
MY SCENE IS REALLY,
LIKE, THE ONLY ONE

03:27.000 --> 03:28.888
THAT'S EVEN
REMOTELY SCARY.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.949
BECKY, YOU MAKE A MAJOR IMPACT
IN THIS MOVIE.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.848
MAJOR.

03:33.860 --> 03:36.021
LIKE, SOMEBODY EVEN SAID
THAT ANGELICA'S SCENE,

03:36.030 --> 03:38.999
IT WASN'T EVEN SCARY AT ALL,
LIKE, IT WAS FUNNY,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.798
AND NOT
IN A GOOD WAY.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.951
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU DON'T GET PIGEON-HOLED NOW,

03:44.960 --> 03:46.393
WHICH IS WHY I THINK

03:46.400 --> 03:48.288
YOU SHOULDN'T
SHOW YOUR TITS ANYMORE.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.922
(female #1 )
WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.353
(female #2 )
I KNOW, IT MAKES FUCKING
"BLAIR WITCH 2"

03:56.360 --> 03:57.827
LOOK LIKE "TITANIC".

03:57.830 --> 03:59.718
IT'S JUST
SO FUCKING GRATUITOUS.

03:59.730 --> 04:04.155
WELL, I THINK THAT WHAT MAKES
THIS MOVIE DIFFERENT IS THAT

04:04.160 --> 04:06.321
THE VIOLENCE
ISN'T SO GRATUITOUS,

04:06.330 --> 04:07.991
IT'S MORE, LIKE,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.696
THE WHOLE MOVIE IS ABOUT
THE WHOLE...

04:10.700 --> 04:12.850
PSYCHOLOGICAL
NATURE OF FEAR.

04:12.860 --> 04:16.023
( female )
I TOTALLY MAXED OUT
HIS VISA CARD PAYING FOR IT,

04:16.030 --> 04:18.396
BUT THEN SOMEBODY
IN JOE ROTH'S OFFICE SAW IT

04:18.400 --> 04:20.721
AND SAID IT
WAS LIKE, GENIUS,

04:20.730 --> 04:22.948
AND NOW HE HAS LIKE
THREE MEETINGS.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.996
SERIOUSLY,
YOU COULD WRITE IT.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.797
I'VE READ YOUR POETRY
AND IT'S REALLY GOOD.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.052
I THINK I SHOULD
DIRECT IT TOO.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.052
YEAH, AND WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE,
THIS REALLY HOT SEX SCENE,

04:32.060 --> 04:34.392
BUT ALL LIKE
GRITI'Y AND REAL,

04:34.400 --> 04:36.755
YOU KNOW,
LIKE, EUROPEAN.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.557
I'M NOT SHOWING MY ASS.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.723
MY MANAGER SAYS I NEED
TO STOP SHOWING MY ASS.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.818
( toilet flushing )

05:03.300 --> 05:05.723
(female #1 )
YOU HAVE A PIECE OF TOILET PAPER
STUCK TO YOUR SHOE.

05:05.730 --> 05:07.823
(female #2 )
SHUT UP, WHERE ?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.050
OH, HONEY.

05:34.060 --> 05:35.425
HONEY ?

05:35.430 --> 05:37.591
IT'S NOT WORKING.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.851
WHAT ?

05:38.860 --> 05:42.455
OH, NO, IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN FOR ME.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.454
ALRIGHT.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.395
IT'S NOT,

05:56.400 --> 05:57.992
IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN FOR ME.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.991
SORRY.

06:01.630 --> 06:03.359
WHAT'S WRONG ?

06:03.360 --> 06:04.497
NOTHING.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.149
DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.253
OH, DON'T MAKE
THIS ABOUT ME.

06:08.260 --> 06:11.297
OH, AM I NOT ALLOWED
TO NOT HAVE SEX, FOR ONCE ?

06:11.300 --> 06:13.052
IS THAT WHAT
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS NOW ?

06:14.100 --> 06:15.294
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.291
YOU WOKE ME UP
BY GOING DOWN ON ME !

06:24.100 --> 06:27.024
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

06:28.730 --> 06:31.597
MAYBE THAT CAR ACCIDENT
WE HAD GAVE ME SOME WEIRD

06:31.600 --> 06:34.922
OLIVER SACHS
BLOW-TO-TH E-HEAD DISEASE.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.290
MY WHOLE LIFE
SEEMS LIKE A BAD DREAM.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.019
IT'S LIKE...

06:46.500 --> 06:50.095
IT'S LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.359
LIKE IF MY LIFE
WERE A MOVIE,

06:53.360 --> 06:56.056
I'D FALL ASLEEP
OR I'D WALK OUT.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.924
ARE YOU...

06:58.930 --> 07:01.797
STILL NOT
SEEING ANY CLIENTS ?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.119
I CAN'T.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.997
I CAN'T FACE IT.

07:07.930 --> 07:10.524
YOU KNOW,

07:10.530 --> 07:13.624
SOMETIMES YOU JUST
GO'I'I'A FORCE YOURSELF

07:13.630 --> 07:15.291
TO BE ACTIVE...

07:15.300 --> 07:18.554
WHEN YOU'RE...

07:18.560 --> 07:21.051
WHEN YOU'RE WHAT ?

07:21.660 --> 07:24.424
YOU THINK
I'M DEPRESSED ?

07:25.760 --> 07:27.819
ARE YOU ?

07:27.830 --> 07:30.424
YEAH.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.653
DOESN'T MEAN I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.390
OKAY.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.890
THIS IS
MY SISTER-IN-LAW, ANGIE.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.118
AN-HEH-LEE-CA.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.688
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

07:49.700 --> 07:50.826
LIKEWISE.

07:50.830 --> 07:52.457
AND, UH,
THIS IS BRODY FARRELL.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.553
YO.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.448
ARE YOU
THE NEXT OF KIN ?

07:56.460 --> 08:00.328
NO, BECKY'S PARENTS DIED
WHEN SHE WAS TWO,

08:00.330 --> 08:02.958
SHE WAS RAISED
BY HER GRANDMOTHER,

08:02.960 --> 08:05.599
WHO ALSO DIED.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.455
SHE DIDN'T
REALLY HAVE ANYBODY,

08:08.460 --> 08:10.291
EXCEPT US.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.029
I SEE.

08:12.030 --> 08:13.827
CAN I ASK
WHO WILL BE...

08:13.830 --> 08:15.491
THE CAST OF THE MOVIE,

08:15.500 --> 08:18.094
WE'RE ALL PITCHING IN
TO PAY FOR IT.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.988
WELL,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.959
WE'RE GOING TO NEED ONE PERSON
TO BE DESIGNATED AS THE...

08:23.960 --> 08:25.689
OH, BRODY'LL DO THAT.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.849
YEAH.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.158
SHE WAS SORT OF
MY GIRLFRIEND.

08:30.530 --> 08:31.929
NOW...

08:31.930 --> 08:34.398
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF SERVICE YOU'D LIKE ?

08:34.400 --> 08:35.651
CHEAP.

08:35.660 --> 08:39.255
WELL, WE PROVIDE
A VARIETY OF SERVICES

08:39.260 --> 08:41.626
FOR THE MORE
BUDGET-CONSCIOUS CLIENT.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.257
( phone ringing )

08:43.260 --> 08:45.956
SORRY, JUST LET ME
TURN THIS OFF.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.188
TAKE IT.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.891
I CAN HANDLE IT.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.989
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.223
DAVID FISHER.

08:58.230 --> 08:59.754
Hi, David,
It's Kevin Miller.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.694
You answered my personal ad
in the "LA. Weekly" ?

09:01.700 --> 09:02.894
I'm the fireman ?

09:02.900 --> 09:05.221
YES, HI.

09:05.230 --> 09:06.527
HI, OF COURSE.

09:06.530 --> 09:09.624
WE CAN START WITH THE MOST
SIMPLE OF TRADITIONAL FUNERALS,

09:09.630 --> 09:13.350
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE
OUR AMERICAN EAGLE CASKET HERE.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.191
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD BURY HER.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.296
BECKY WAS LIKE TOTALLY
TERRIFIED OF THE DARK.

09:21.330 --> 09:24.891
WELL, WE CAN
STILL HAVE A VIEWING,

09:24.900 --> 09:29.257
DURING WHICH THE CASKET
WILL NEVER BE CLOSED,

09:29.260 --> 09:31.148
FOLLOWED
BY A CREMATION.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.221
THAT'S GOOD, AND THEN
WE COULD SCATTER HER ASHES

09:35.230 --> 09:38.654
SOMEPLACE SHE REALLY LIKED,
LIKE GRIFFITH PARK,

09:38.660 --> 09:41.197
OR THE LAVA LOUNGE
ON LA BREA.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.690
YEAH.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.225
I MEAN, I THINK
WE CAN SKIP THE CASKET.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.760
WELL, YOU SOUND
LIKE A REALLY NICE GUY TOO.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.296
Well, I am
a really nice guy.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.791
So, do you want to meet for
coffee later this afternoon ?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.688
THIS AFTERNOON ?
UH, SURE, SURE.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.658
I HAVE SOMETHING AT THREE,
BUT I COULD MEET YOU AFI'ER THAT.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.252
Great,
let's say 4:00

10:01.260 --> 10:03.194
at the "Up All Night"
coffeehouse.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.122
I'll be wearing
a red baseball cap.

10:05.130 --> 10:06.552
GREAT, I LOVE RED.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.448
I MEAN, IT'S ONE
OF MY FAVORITE COLORS.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.451
OF WHICH
I HAVE SEVERAL.

10:10.460 --> 10:11.825
Okay, see you then.

10:11.830 --> 10:12.626
OKAY.

10:13.730 --> 10:17.848
NOW, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL
AND UNUSUAL CREMAINS VESSEL.

10:17.860 --> 10:20.158
THE ASHES ACTUALLY
FILL THESE DOLPHINS,

10:20.160 --> 10:21.889
WHICH ARE
CARVED OUT INSIDE...

10:21.900 --> 10:23.720
SHE WASN'T
REALLY INTO DOLPHINS.

10:23.730 --> 10:25.322
I REMEMBER...

10:25.330 --> 10:28.219
SOMEBODY SUGGESTING
SHE BOYCO'I'I' TUNA, YOU KNOW,

10:28.230 --> 10:31.427
BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE DOLPHINS
GE'I'I'ING CAUGHT IN THE NET THING,

10:31.430 --> 10:34.957
AND SHE SAID,
"FUCK DOLPHINS,

10:34.960 --> 10:37.827
I WANT
A NICOISE SALAD."

10:40.600 --> 10:42.397
WHAT ARE THESE ?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.960
THOSE ARE KEEPSAKE
MINIATURE URNS,

10:44.960 --> 10:47.599
SORT OF LIKE LOCKETS,
IF YOU WILL.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.989
SO, EVERYBODY CAN
GET A PIECE OF HER.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.118
YES, IT'S AN OLD CUSTOM
FROM THAILAND.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.651
BECKY LOVED THAI FOOD.

10:57.660 --> 10:58.627
SO...

10:58.630 --> 10:59.858
WHAT DID I MISS ?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.221
HEY.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.618
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

11:16.630 --> 11:19.554
WHY WEREN'T YOU
IN SCHOOL TODAY ?

11:19.560 --> 11:21.357
I WAS
IN SCHOOL TODAY,

11:21.360 --> 11:24.352
I JUST WASN'T
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.488
I MEAN, WHO NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT SHIT ANYWAYS, RIGHT ?

11:27.500 --> 11:30.549
WELL, SOMEBODY WHO WANTS
TO HAVE SOME CONCEPT

11:30.560 --> 11:31.925
OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS

11:31.930 --> 11:33.955
SO HE CAN HAVE
A FUCKING CHANCE IN LIFE.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.088
WHOA, WHAT CRAWLED
UP YOUR ASS ?

11:37.100 --> 11:40.627
I MEAN, IT'S ALL LIES
ANYWAYS.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.557
WHERE WERE YOU ?

11:43.560 --> 11:46.154
ANDY AND I SKIPPED OUT
AFI'ER LUNCH.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.991
WE WENT
TO THE CAR MUSEUM.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.456
DID YOU GET HIGH ?

11:49.460 --> 11:50.996
YEAH.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.026
I'M 18 YEARS OLD,
LIVING IN FUCKING CALIFORNIA.

11:54.030 --> 11:55.952
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO GET HIGH ?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.598
HEY, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, GABE.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.558
IN CASE YOU DON'T REMEMBER,
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.157
I'M...

12:09.830 --> 12:11.991
I'M SORRY, OKAY ?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.456
BUT...

12:13.460 --> 12:16.623
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME, I SWEAR.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.653
PLEASE DON'T LIE TO ME.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.992
I'M NOT.

12:26.060 --> 12:27.527
LOOK...

12:27.530 --> 12:29.691
I'M OKAY.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.157
AND I'M GONNA
STAY OKAY.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.019
AS LONG AS
I HAVE YOU.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.228
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR TEST RESULTS.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.998
WELL, I HAVE
SOME VERY GOOD NEWS.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.696
YOU TESTED NEGATIVE
FOR THE HIV ANTIBODY.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.327
OH, THANK GOD.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.924
YOU NEED TO BE TESTED AGAIN
IN SIX MONTHS, JUST TO BE SAFE.

13:10.930 --> 13:12.898
LET'S SEE.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.197
NEGATIVE FOR CH LAMYDIA,

13:14.200 --> 13:16.191
ALL THE HEPATITISES,
SYPHILIS.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.326
OOH.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.093
POSITIVE FOR GONORRHEA.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.294
WHAT ?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.449
YEAH.

13:21.460 --> 13:24.099
HAVE YOU HAD ANY PAIN
OR DIFFICULTY URINATING ?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.226
NO.

13:25.230 --> 13:26.925
ANY PENILE
OR ANAL DISCHARGE ?

13:26.930 --> 13:28.454
NO!

13:28.460 --> 13:31.850
WELL, GONORRHEA CAN BE
COMPLETELY ASYM PTOMATIC,

13:31.860 --> 13:33.293
BUT IF
IT'S LEFI' UNTREATED,

13:33.300 --> 13:35.791
IT CAN LEAD TO SEVERE PROBLEMS
DOWN THE LINE.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.392
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME CIPRO,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.356
IT USUALLY
KNOCKS IT RIGHT OUT.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.555
WELL, THIS IS
CERTAINLY EMBARRASSING.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.926
DID YOU ENGAGE
IN UNPROTECTED SEX ?

13:43.930 --> 13:45.750
UH, YES.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.359
BAD BOY.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.795
( door opening )

14:00.360 --> 14:02.351
CLAIRE.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.793
YEAH ?

14:03.800 --> 14:05.392
HOW WAS SCHOOL ?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.425
DULL AND DEPRESSING.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.054
WHAT ARE YOU
READING ?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.199
"NOW THAT YOU KNOW".

14:14.200 --> 14:16.589
"NOW THAT YOU KNOW" WHAT ?

14:16.600 --> 14:19.228
THAT DAVID IS GAY.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.692
OH.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.822
I TAKE IT
YOU KNEW ALREADY.

14:24.830 --> 14:25.854
YEAH.

14:25.860 --> 14:30.593
WELL, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT IT ?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.295
ARE YOU HURT ?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.824
ANGRY ?

14:33.830 --> 14:36.151
DO YOU WISH
HE WASN'T GAY ?

14:36.160 --> 14:37.798
NO.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.519
THOSE ARE ALL
VALID FEELINGS, YOU KNOW.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.693
I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S GAY.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.622
JUST AS LONG
AS HE'S HAPPY.

14:45.630 --> 14:49.521
ACCORDING TO THIS BOOK,
WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY OPEN

14:49.530 --> 14:51.122
TO HOW WE FEEL

14:51.130 --> 14:53.018
AND WE SHOULD TRY
TO EXPRESS THOSE FEELINGS,

14:53.030 --> 14:56.022
BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION
OF INTIMACY IS TRUTH.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.720
OKAY.

14:58.730 --> 15:02.894
HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY FEELINGS
OF SAME-SEX ATTRACTION ?

15:02.900 --> 15:04.253
WHAT ?

15:04.260 --> 15:05.727
NO, MOM.

15:05.730 --> 15:08.028
IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

15:08.030 --> 15:09.099
I KNOW.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.519
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

15:14.530 --> 15:18.557
I ACTUALLY HAD A LITTLE
CRUSH ON JANE FONDA.

15:21.860 --> 15:25.250
WELL, SHE'S SINGLE AGAIN,
SO, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.996
I JUST NEVER GOT INTO THAT WHOLE
PROMISCUOUS THING, YOU KNOW ?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.355
THE FIRST GUY
I HAD SEX WITH...

15:38.360 --> 15:41.557
I ENDED UP IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH FOR FOUR YEARS.

15:42.430 --> 15:45.058
ONE-MAN KIND OF GUY,
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.197
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

15:46.200 --> 15:47.724
DEFINITELY.

15:47.730 --> 15:49.459
DEFINITELY.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.020
I MEAN, SEX JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF HAVING SEX, WHAT IS THAT ?

15:52.030 --> 15:54.248
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LOVE SEX.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.057
I'M A VERY
SEXUAL BEING,

15:56.060 --> 15:59.120
I JUST THINK IT'S WAY BE'I'I'ER
WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING EMOTIONAL

15:59.130 --> 16:01.997
GOING ON BEHIND IT,
YOU KNOW ?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.321
I CREDIT MY PARENTS
FOR THAT,

16:04.330 --> 16:06.821
MY MOM AND DAD HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS

16:06.830 --> 16:09.390
AND THEY'RE STILL HOT
FOR EACH OTHER.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.197
AND THEY'VE NEVER
BEEN ANYTHING

16:11.200 --> 16:13.191
BUT 100%
SUPPORTIVE OF ME.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.553
WOW.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.322
I GO'I'I'A GET TO WORK.

16:29.330 --> 16:30.456
LISTEN,

16:30.460 --> 16:32.121
IT'S BEEN
GREAT MEETING YOU.

16:32.130 --> 16:33.495
YEAH, THIS WAS FUN.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.559
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DO IT AGAIN ?

16:35.560 --> 16:36.959
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.394
YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY NICE GUY.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.527
BUT I GO'I'I'A BE HONEST,

16:41.530 --> 16:43.521
I DIDN'T FEE
MUCH OF A SPARK.

16:43.530 --> 16:46.419
CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN
IF IT'S NOT THERE, RIGHT ?

16:59.630 --> 17:01.188
YEP.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.725
IT DEFINITELY
LOOKS LIKE AVM.

17:05.830 --> 17:06.854
FUCK.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.323
SO, NOW WHAT ?

17:12.330 --> 17:14.195
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.225
REMIND ME WHAT
YOUR SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN.

17:16.230 --> 17:17.549
HEADACH ES.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.629
ALL THE TIME ?

17:18.630 --> 17:21.224
NO, JUST OCCASIONALLY.

17:21.230 --> 17:23.391
MOSTLY ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF MY HEAD.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.822
YEP.

17:24.830 --> 17:26.991
ANY SEIZURES,
IMPAIRMENT OF VISION,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.627
SENSE OF SMELL ?

17:28.630 --> 17:30.791
WELL, ONCE I HAD
LIKE A FLU'I'I'ER,

17:30.800 --> 17:33.018
JUST ON THE EDGE
OF MY VISION.

17:33.030 --> 17:34.759
I'M AS
BLIND AS A BAT,

17:34.760 --> 17:37.490
AND ONCE I WOKE UP, COULD SEE
PERFECT LY OUT OF MY LEFI' EYE.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.298
LASTED FOR LIKE A DAY
AND THEN IT WENT AWAY.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.427
WHO KNOWS
WHAT THE HELL THAT WAS.

17:43.800 --> 17:44.721
HUH.

17:45.930 --> 17:48.194
SO, WHAT NEXT ?

17:48.200 --> 17:51.055
WELL, LET'S SEE.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.058
IT'S IN A NOT OVERLY
ELOQUENT BRAIN AREA.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.857
HMM.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.452
ARE YOU LEFT-HANDED ?

18:00.460 --> 18:01.358
NO.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.396
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.027
WHY NOT ?

18:05.030 --> 18:06.850
AND IT'S A LITTLE LARGER
THAN I'D LIKE IT TO BE.

18:06.860 --> 18:09.328
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE LARGER
THAN I'D LIKE IT TO BE.

18:09.330 --> 18:10.752
UGH...

18:10.760 --> 18:11.920
OKAY,

18:11.930 --> 18:13.693
YOU WANT OPTIONS,

18:13.700 --> 18:15.998
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE BIG THREE.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.956
CRANIAL SURGERY,
NOT A PICNIC.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.928
EM BOLIZATION . ..

18:19.930 --> 18:22.956
CLOSING OFF
THE BLOOD VESSELS

18:22.960 --> 18:24.928
BY INJECTING
GLUE INTO THEM,

18:24.930 --> 18:27.592
SOMETIMES WE USE
PLATINUM COILS INSTEAD.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.694
AND FINALLY...

18:30.700 --> 18:32.349
RADIOSURGERY.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.920
FOCUSED RADIATION.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.027
DIE, YOU LITTLE
MOTHERFUCKER !

18:46.130 --> 18:49.190
IF I'D NEVER
BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT

18:49.200 --> 18:51.327
AND GOTTEN A ROUTINE
X-RAY OF MY SKULL,

18:51.330 --> 18:53.958
THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER
EVEN COME UP, RIGHT ?

18:53.960 --> 18:56.099
UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENED.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.819
WELL, I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT I COULD GO MY ENTIRE LIFE

18:58.830 --> 19:00.593
WITHOUT IT
EVER CREATING A PROBLEM.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.795
WELL, ANYTHING'S
POSSIBLE.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.427
DO YOU THINK
I NEED SURGERY ?

19:04.430 --> 19:06.853
WELL, I CAN'T REALLY SAY
WITHOUT MORE TESTS.

19:06.860 --> 19:09.658
I THINK YOU MIGHT BENEFIT
FROM EMBOLIZATION.

19:09.660 --> 19:12.128
HOWEVER, ANY TIME YOU CLOSE OFF
THE LARGE ARTERIES

19:12.130 --> 19:13.859
GOING INTO AN AVM,

19:13.860 --> 19:16.351
THE SMALLER
BLOOD VESSELS FEEDING IT

19:16.360 --> 19:19.397
TEND TO INCREASE IN SIZE.

19:19.400 --> 19:23.427
OH, OH, OKAY, YEAH,
SO, IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK.

19:24.700 --> 19:28.124
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
SO MUCH WE CAN DO.

19:28.130 --> 19:28.892
OH, GOD.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.094
FUCK, FINE !

19:30.100 --> 19:32.193
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING, OKAY ?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.327
I'M JUST GONNA TRY AND PUT THIS
ALL OUT OF MY HEAD,

19:34.330 --> 19:36.594
NO PUN INTENDED,
AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.397
I'M NOT SURE I THINK--

19:38.400 --> 19:40.152
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
WHAT YOU THINK,

19:40.160 --> 19:41.798
YOU ARROGANT
PIECE OF SHIT.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.588
OKAY, EVEN IF WE DECIDE
NOT TO DO ANYTHING--

19:45.600 --> 19:47.488
THERE'S NO "WE",
I DECIDE.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.719
I'D STILL LIKE TO GET
ANOTHER MRI ON YOU
IN 12 MONTHS.

19:50.730 --> 19:52.857
YEAH, AND I'D LIKE A FUCKING
STRAIGHT ANSWER, ASSHOLE.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.397
IT'S KIND OF IRONIC.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.197
YOU DON'T SMOKE,
YOU RUN EVERY DAY,

19:58.200 --> 20:00.191
YOU EAT ALL
THAT HEALTHY CRAP.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.758
SHUT UP !

20:01.760 --> 20:05.924
NOW, ME, I SMOKED, I DRANK,
I ATE ANY OLD THING I WANTED,

20:05.930 --> 20:09.718
AND I INHALED EMBALMING FLUID
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.095
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

20:11.100 --> 20:13.625
IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT BUS,
I WOULD'VE LIVED TO BE 93.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.056
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE DRIVEN SINCE THEN,

20:18.060 --> 20:19.891
YOU MAY WANT
TO FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT.

20:19.900 --> 20:20.958
YEAH ?

20:20.960 --> 20:23.326
WELL, WHO'S THE DEAD MAN
IN THIS CAR, HUH ?

20:23.330 --> 20:24.854
IT'S NOT ME !

20:24.860 --> 20:26.293
WHOA !

20:26.300 --> 20:29.019
( honking horn )
FUCK YOU !

20:29.030 --> 20:32.124
FUCK YOU !
FUCK YOU !

20:50.700 --> 20:53.453
HE SEEN ME

20:55.600 --> 20:57.989
SO CLEARLY

21:00.230 --> 21:02.755
COME OVER

21:05.600 --> 21:07.659
AND GET MY NUMBER

21:10.900 --> 21:12.822
HE COME AROUND

21:14.330 --> 21:17.219
HE'LL BREAK DOWN

21:19.430 --> 21:24.129
SEE ME BE

21:24.130 --> 21:26.655
DON'T EVER LEAVE ME

21:29.500 --> 21:30.990
AAH

21:33.660 --> 21:36.299
AAH, NO

21:38.500 --> 21:40.923
WE THANK YOU,
HEAVENLY FATHER,

21:40.930 --> 21:43.251
FOR THIS AND ALL THY BLESSINGS,
IN CHRIST'S NAME, AMEN.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.727
AMEN.

21:46.530 --> 21:49.624
I'VE INVITED NIKOLAI
TO DINNER SUNDAY NIGHT,

21:49.630 --> 21:51.723
I'D LIKE YOU
ALL TO BE THERE.

21:51.730 --> 21:53.857
NIKOLAI,
THE FLOWER GUY ?

21:53.860 --> 21:55.259
YES.

21:55.260 --> 21:58.127
HE AND I ARE HAVING
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP NOW.

21:58.130 --> 22:00.348
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING TO LAST, BUT...

22:00.360 --> 22:02.055
WELL, THERE IT IS.

22:04.730 --> 22:06.891
WE'RE ALL ADULTS,
WE'RE ALL SEXUAL BEINGS.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.549
WE SHOULD
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.588
OKAY.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.694
NATE, I'D LIKE YOU
TO INVITE BRENDA,

22:17.700 --> 22:20.498
CLAIRE, I'D LIKE YOU
TO INVITE GABRIEL DIMAS,

22:20.500 --> 22:24.095
AND DAVID, IF YOU
HAVE A SPECIAL FRIEND,

22:24.100 --> 22:26.159
I'D LIKE FOR HIM
TO COME AS WELL.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.993
WHY IS
MY FRIEND "SPECIAL" ?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.558
ALRIG HT,

22:30.560 --> 22:32.755
IF YOU'RE
HAVING SEX WITH ANYONE,

22:32.760 --> 22:34.694
I'D LIKE TO MEET HIM,
IS THAT BETTER ?

22:34.700 --> 22:36.122
NOT REALLY.

22:36.130 --> 22:37.597
( laughing )

22:37.600 --> 22:39.750
STOP ACTING
LIKE CHILDREN !

22:42.360 --> 22:44.624
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

22:44.630 --> 22:46.689
I'M JUST
GETTING AN ASPIRIN.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.429
DO YOU
HAVE A HEADACHE ?

22:48.430 --> 22:51.149
NO, I READ SOMEWHERE YOU SHOULD
TAKE AN ASPIRIN A DAY,

22:51.160 --> 22:52.718
IT KEEPS THE BLOOD THIN.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.823
PLEASE, IF OUR BLOOD WERE
ANY THINNER, WE'D EVAPORATE.

22:54.830 --> 22:56.593
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.955
IS THAT SOME SORT OF INSULT,
WE'RE THIN-BLOODED ?

22:58.960 --> 23:00.723
MOM, NO,
IT WAS A JOKE.

23:00.730 --> 23:03.028
I'M MORE THIN-BLOODED
THAN ANY OF US, PROBABLY.

23:03.030 --> 23:05.999
ARE YOU
SEEING ANYONE ?

23:07.360 --> 23:08.691
NO.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.351
WELL, WHY NOT ?

23:11.360 --> 23:14.659
SEX IS AN IMPORTANT
AND HEALTHY PART OF LIFE.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.491
IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.728
YES, I KNOW THAT.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.652
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M NOT
HAVING ANY RIGHT NOW.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.548
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT COP ?

23:21.560 --> 23:24.154
THE BLACK MAN.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.196
HE MET SOMEONE ELSE.

23:37.460 --> 23:39.496
THANK YOU.

23:40.630 --> 23:42.951
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
FREE TIME TOMORROW ?

23:42.960 --> 23:44.689
( Brenda )
I don't think so.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.292
I'D REALLY
LIKE TO SEE YOU.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.450
I have three
Shiatsu appointments.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.528
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT WANTED ME
TO GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

23:54.530 --> 23:57.328
Well, you can still come
Sunday night for dinner, right ?

23:57.330 --> 23:59.924
EVEN IF JUST
FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.727
IT'S BOUND
TO BE A FREAK-FEST.

24:01.730 --> 24:03.493
I think so.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.252
Maybe.

24:05.260 --> 24:06.852
I MISS YOU.

24:06.860 --> 24:08.623
YOU JUST SAW ME.

24:08.630 --> 24:10.518
I know, I just...

24:12.130 --> 24:14.598
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE
WITH YOU AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.727
RIGHT NOW.

24:16.730 --> 24:18.755
I'll see you soon.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.899
SUNDAY, OKAY ?

24:22.060 --> 24:24.199
I LOVE YOU.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.327
YOU, TOO.

24:49.630 --> 24:51.450
HEY, RICO.

24:51.460 --> 24:54.759
HEY, BOSS MAN,
I GOT A FAVOR TO ASK YOU.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.491
OKAY.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.197
COULD YOU PLEASE
DROP HER OFF AT THE CREMATORIUM
FOR ME TONIGHT ?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.827
UH...

25:02.830 --> 25:04.297
C'MON, MAN.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.790
VAN ESSA'S JUST A BIT
OVERWHELMED AT HOME.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.153
JULIO'S GOT A COLD,

25:07.160 --> 25:09.822
AND AUGUSTO HASN'T SLEPT THROUGH
THE NIGHT FOR LIKE, A MONTH.

25:14.060 --> 25:15.857
NO, NO, I CAN'T.

25:16.930 --> 25:19.649
I'M SORRY, RICO,
BUT I CAN'T.

25:19.660 --> 25:20.627
I JUST CAN'T.

25:24.660 --> 25:25.797
OKAY.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.324
WELL, CAN YOU AT LEAST HELP ME
PUT HER INSIDE THE BOX ?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.488
SURE.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.219
SO, A CARDBOARD BOX, HUH ?

25:41.230 --> 25:42.891
CLASSY.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.551
HEY, SHE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK
HER LIFE WAS WORTH ANYTHING,

25:45.560 --> 25:47.425
SO, IT MAKES
SENSE TO ME.

25:47.430 --> 25:48.852
ON THREE.

25:48.860 --> 25:50.657
ONE, TWO, THREE.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.797
IT'S KINDA SAD.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.859
NO, IT'S NOT.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.556
SHE THREW HER
FUCKING LIFE AWAY.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.051
THAT'S NOT SAD,
IT'S PATHETIC.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.289
WE TEND TO FORGET
HOW MANY GIFTS

26:20.300 --> 26:22.552
GOD HAS GIVEN
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.

26:22.560 --> 26:26.052
BECAUSE OUR LIVES ARE
SO FILLED WITH DISTRACT IONS.

26:26.060 --> 26:29.257
CROWDED WITH MESSAGES
COMPETING FOR OUR ATTENTION,

26:29.260 --> 26:32.923
ENCOURAGING US
TO BE UNHAPPY WITH OUR LIVES.

26:32.930 --> 26:35.148
IF ONLY
WE LOOKED YOUNGER,

26:35.160 --> 26:37.526
HAD PERFECT SKIN,

26:37.530 --> 26:41.091
ZERO BODY FAT.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.227
THE TRUTH OF
THE MATTER IS...

26:43.230 --> 26:46.358
GOD LOVES US
JUST THE WAY WE ARE.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.897
SOME PEOPLE SAID,
"CONGRATULATIONS,

26:48.900 --> 26:50.629
YOU'VE REALLY
SHAKEN THINGS UP,"

26:50.630 --> 26:52.097
WHATEVER.

26:52.100 --> 26:53.624
BUT MOST PEOPLE
IN THE CONGREGATION

26:53.630 --> 26:56.519
WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH ME AFTER THAT, SO...

26:56.530 --> 26:58.498
NOW I'M BACK
AT SAINT STEPHEN'S.

27:04.430 --> 27:06.955
SO, HOW ARE
YOU GUYS ?

27:06.960 --> 27:09.258
GOOD,
WE'RE GOOD.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.820
WE JUST GOT BACK
FROM A WEEKEND IN SAN DIEGO.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.593
IT WAS SPECTACULAR.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.352
YEAH, WE WENT
PARA-SAI LING.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.624
KEITH WON'T ADMIT IT,
BUT HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

27:17.630 --> 27:19.427
I WAS NOT SCARED.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.648
I MIGHT'VE HAD A LITTLE
RUSH OF ADRENALINE, BUT,

27:21.660 --> 27:23.548
HEY, THAT'S THE POINT,
RIGHT ?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.994
I'M GONNA HAVE HIM HANG-GLIDING
BY THE END OF THE YEAR

27:26.000 --> 27:27.228
IF IT KILLS ME.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.720
IN YOUR DREAMS, FOOL.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.927
I AM NOT BREAKING EVERY BONE
IN MY BODY JUST TO IMPRESS YOU.

27:31.930 --> 27:33.750
SEVEN YEARS
I'VE BEEN HANG-GLIDING

27:33.760 --> 27:35.352
AND I NEVER
BROKE ANYTHING.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.918
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY.

27:36.930 --> 27:38.488
DON'T I KNOW IT.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.055
( male announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen !

27:43.060 --> 27:49.295
Only one of these men will be
crowned "Mr. Gay Black America".

27:54.500 --> 27:57.697
DID I TELL YOU
I'M MOVING ?

27:57.700 --> 27:59.292
WHERE ?

27:59.300 --> 28:00.653
SAME BUILDING.

28:00.660 --> 28:02.196
A BIGGER PLACE
OPENED UP,

28:02.200 --> 28:04.657
WE'VE BEEN WANTING
TO GET A DOG.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.627
GREAT !

28:14.700 --> 28:17.453
DO I SEEM MORE TENSE
THAN USUAL ?

28:17.460 --> 28:20.258
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK, REMEMBER ?

28:20.260 --> 28:22.490
IT TAKES US
BOTH OUT OF IT.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.549
THE ONLY CONVERSATION
IS BETWEEN YOUR BODY...

28:25.560 --> 28:27.425
AND MY HANDS.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.694
YEAH, WELL,

28:29.700 --> 28:32.749
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
BUT WE'RE ON MY DIME HERE.

28:34.900 --> 28:37.698
I'VE DISCOVERED
ONE OF THE WORST THINGS

28:37.700 --> 28:39.691
ABOUT SELLING
THREE MILLION BOOKS...

28:39.700 --> 28:43.295
IS CONSTANTLY FEELING LIKE
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR IT.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.892
YOU KNOW ?

28:44.900 --> 28:47.357
IT'S LIKE,
OH, I MAKE A TON OF MONEY,

28:47.360 --> 28:49.453
SO, I MUST BE
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.098
YES.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.920
YES, WHAT ?

28:52.930 --> 28:54.898
YOU DO SEEM
MORE TENSE THAN USUAL.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.925
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR CANCER,

28:56.930 --> 28:59.296
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR WORLD HUNGER.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.154
WHAT IF I'M JUST HAPPY,

29:01.160 --> 29:04.027
AND THAT'S MY CONTRIBUTION
TO THE WORLD ?

29:04.030 --> 29:05.691
YOU KNOW ?

29:05.700 --> 29:08.851
I'M THINKING OF
PITCHING A BOOK-- AH !

29:08.860 --> 29:11.351
--TO MY PUBLISHER,
SORT OF A CULTURAL HISTORY,

29:11.360 --> 29:14.193
TRACING THE HOW
AND THE WHY AND WHEN...

29:14.200 --> 29:16.452
IT BECAME SUCH
A SIN TO BE HAPPY.

29:16.460 --> 29:17.495
DROP.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.819
WHO KNOWS ?

29:18.830 --> 29:21.253
IT MIGHT HELP SOME OF
THOSE POOR SAD FUCKS

29:21.260 --> 29:23.751
WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF
EXPERIENCING JOY.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.022
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.725
EXCUSE ME ?

29:28.730 --> 29:30.755
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY HOUSE !

29:30.760 --> 29:32.557
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU ?

29:32.560 --> 29:34.892
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE SHRED OF
RESPECT FOR ME OR WHAT I DO.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.253
I'M JUST ANOTHER
FUCKING SERVANT

29:36.260 --> 29:38.023
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO LISTEN
TO YOUR BULLSHIT

29:38.030 --> 29:39.190
AND PRETEND LIKE
I DON'T THINK

29:39.200 --> 29:41.725
YOU'RE THE STUPID,
ASSHOLE WINDBAG THAT YOU ARE.

29:41.730 --> 29:44.028
YOU CRAZY BITCH,

29:44.030 --> 29:46.498
I'M PAYING YOU
FOR A SHIATSU,

29:46.500 --> 29:49.025
AND I INTEND
TO GET A SHIATSU.

29:50.230 --> 29:52.619
I DON'T NEED
YOUR FUCKING MONEY !

29:57.960 --> 30:00.895
I DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE
TO TREAT ME LIKE THIS.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.219
YEAH ?

30:02.230 --> 30:05.199
WELL, IF YOU DON'T GET OUT
OF MY FUCKING HOUSE RIGHT NOW

30:05.200 --> 30:06.849
I'LL CALL "THE LA. TIMES"

30:06.860 --> 30:09.522
AND I'LL TELL THEM ABOUT
THE LIPO SCARS ON YOUR ASS.

30:12.860 --> 30:14.555
RIGHT NOW.

30:14.560 --> 30:18.690
GET OUT, GET OUT,
GET OUT, GET OUT !

30:20.360 --> 30:22.453
( door slamming )

30:22.460 --> 30:23.688
UGH !

30:35.130 --> 30:37.496
SO, THIS IS
WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.422
YEAH, THIS IS IT.

30:41.930 --> 30:43.955
WHAT'S THAT SMELL ?

30:43.960 --> 30:45.894
DISINFECTANT,

30:45.900 --> 30:47.390
BURNT COFFEE,

30:47.400 --> 30:49.152
EMBALMING FLUID.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.457
YUM.

30:54.660 --> 30:59.290
"FOR THE VELVETY LOOK AND FEEL
OF ACTUAL LIVING TISSUE."

30:59.300 --> 31:01.552
NO FUCKING WAY.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.529
OH, YOU DO NOT
EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.829
THEY HAVE THESE PLASTIC LIKE,
SCREWS, ONLY BIGGER,

31:07.830 --> 31:10.719
THAT THEY LIKE,
STICK INTO PEOPLE'S ORIFICES.

31:10.730 --> 31:12.698
SO STUFF
WON'T SPILL OUT.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.826
THAT'S SOME
KIND OF FUCKED UP.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.627
YEAH,
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

31:23.630 --> 31:27.157
SO, THIS IS
WHERE MY BROTHER WAS.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.197
OH, JESUS,
I'M SORRY,

31:30.200 --> 31:32.054
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT YOU DOWN HERE.

31:32.660 --> 31:34.355
H EY,

31:34.360 --> 31:36.794
I'M THE ONE
WHO ASKED TO SEE IT.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.754
COME HERE.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.659
WHAT ?

31:50.660 --> 31:53.220
YOU'RE THE FIRST GUY
I'VE EVER BROUGHT HOME

31:53.230 --> 31:54.822
TO MEET MY FAMILY AND...

31:54.830 --> 31:57.321
I FEEL WEIRD,
YOU KNOW ?

31:57.330 --> 31:58.991
I FEEL LIKE, NERVOUS.

32:00.030 --> 32:02.157
DON'T WORRY.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.152
I WILL BE ON
MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.219
OKAY ?

32:07.230 --> 32:08.595
C'MON.

32:10.860 --> 32:13.021
( orchestra music playing )

32:24.930 --> 32:26.955
YOUR MOTHER
IS A GOOD WOMAN.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.428
YES, WE'RE AWARE OF THAT.

32:29.430 --> 32:31.398
DAVID, GIVE HIM A BREAK.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.857
I'M SORRY, YOU'LL HAVE
TO EXCUSE MY BROTHER.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.351
HE'S BEEN MAJORLY CRANKY
EVER SINCE HE STOPPED
GETTING LAID.

32:42.630 --> 32:45.554
HOW OLD YOU ARE ?

32:45.560 --> 32:47.255
31.

32:47.260 --> 32:50.457
AH, 31, GOOD.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.098
I HAD A SON,

32:54.100 --> 32:57.558
HE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT
OLDER THAN YOU.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.690
HE WAS STUDENT...

33:01.700 --> 33:03.622
OF MEDICINE.

33:07.530 --> 33:09.998
( Nate )
HEY.

33:11.230 --> 33:13.892
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.128

GABRIEL DIMAS.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.250
I'VE GOT
MAJOR COTTON MOUTH.

33:38.630 --> 33:41.656
WHO WANTS
TO SAY GRACE ?

33:41.660 --> 33:43.491
I WILL SAY GRACE.

33:44.630 --> 33:47.997
THE POOR SHALL EAT
AND BE FILLED,

33:48.000 --> 33:52.027
AND THOSE THAT SEEK THE LORD
SHALL PRAISE HIM,

33:52.030 --> 33:56.649
THEIR HEARTS WILL
LIVE FOREVER AND EVER.

33:56.660 --> 34:00.756
GLORY BE TO THE FATHER,
AND THE SON,

34:00.760 --> 34:02.796
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT,

34:02.800 --> 34:06.497
BOTH NOW

34:48.630 --> 34:50.757
THANK YOU.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.490
YOU'RE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL PERSON,

34:53.500 --> 34:55.297
THERE IS THIS TOTAL LIGHT
COMING OUT OF YOU.

35:01.930 --> 35:03.329
WELL, THAT'S...

35:03.330 --> 35:05.491
A VERY UNUSUAL
COMPLIMENT, NATE.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.389
YOUR BROTHER
IS LIKE, HIGH.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.992
I KNOW,
LOOK AT HIS EYES.

35:13.730 --> 35:15.129
NATE,

35:15.130 --> 35:16.927
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

35:16.930 --> 35:19.228
OH, I AM MORE
THAN ALRIGHT.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.753
I HAVEN'T
FELT THIS GOOD IN...

35:23.760 --> 35:26.228
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.324
YES, YES, YES !

35:31.330 --> 35:34.697
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE I'VE HEARD YOU DO THAT ?

35:34.700 --> 35:35.894
WHAT ?

35:35.900 --> 35:37.128
REMEMBER WHEN
WE WERE FIRST GOING OUT

35:37.130 --> 35:38.199
AND YOU USED TO LAUGH
ALL THE TIME ?

35:38.200 --> 35:39.929
I MISS THAT.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.955
YOUR LAUGHTER'S
LIKE MUSIC.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.224
WHAT ?
NATE.

35:44.230 --> 35:47.051
YOU'RE HIGH.

35:50.130 --> 35:51.757
NO, I'M NOT.

35:53.030 --> 35:54.258
AMI?

35:55.630 --> 35:57.393
LOOK AT THE LIGHT.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.455
OH, MY GOD,

36:06.600 --> 36:08.124
I LOVE THE LITTLE...

36:08.130 --> 36:10.758

36:14.700 --> 36:16.895
WHAT IS HE HIGH ON ?

36:16.900 --> 36:19.198
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.451
I AM SO NOT HUNGRY.

36:26.030 --> 36:29.796
WELL, I THINK THIS WENT
PRETTY GOOD TONIGHT, YEAH ?

36:29.800 --> 36:32.598
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

36:32.600 --> 36:35.694
IT WAS AWKWARD
AND EMBARRASSING.

36:37.430 --> 36:39.125
ONE OF MY SONS
IS HIGH ON DRUGS.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.894
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT THAT ?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.219
SHOULD I INTERVENE ?

36:43.230 --> 36:44.629
JOIN A SUPPORT GROUP ?

36:44.630 --> 36:47.952
HE JUST SEEMS HAPPY.

36:49.630 --> 36:51.757
WE'RE GOING
TO THE MOVIES.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.354
GOODNIGHT,
MRS. FISHER.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.123
THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.256

36:57.260 --> 36:58.693
WE HAVEN'T
DECIDED YET.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.224
BUT WE'LL
BE BACK LATE.

37:00.230 --> 37:02.221
MOM, YOU SAID YOURSELF,

37:02.230 --> 37:03.822
WE'RE ALL ADULTS.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.718
WE'LL BE BACK LATE.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.320
GOODNIGHT.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.492
GOODNIGHT.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.092
GOODNIGHT.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.024
IT'S ALL
ABOUT FLOWING.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.055
IT FLOWS UP,
IT FLOWS DOWN

37:23.060 --> 37:25.824
AND THEN SOMETIMES,
THINGS STOP IT FROM FLOWING,

37:25.830 --> 37:26.956
AND YOU STAY
AND IT'S LIKE,

37:26.960 --> 37:30.088
YOU JUST KIND OF MOVE
IN A LITTLE POOL.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.419
YOU KNOW ?

37:31.430 --> 37:32.897
LIKE YOU'RE IN
A LITTLE EDDY.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.198
AND THAT'S...

37:35.200 --> 37:37.521
WHAT IT ALL COMES
DOWN TO IS...

37:37.530 --> 37:39.191
EVERYTHING,

37:39.200 --> 37:41.122
EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE,

37:41.130 --> 37:45.419
EVERYTHING, THIS THING,
THIS THING IN MY HEAD,

37:45.430 --> 37:48.820
IT'S ALL ABOUT FLOW.

37:48.830 --> 37:52.129
( exhaling )

37:52.130 --> 37:53.654
FLOW ?

38:00.300 --> 38:02.222
UH-HUH.

38:03.200 --> 38:07.022
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,

38:07.030 --> 38:09.419
THAT WAS JUST
SO TOTALLY DAVID.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.798
I LOVE YOU.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.859
OKAY, I'M OUTTA HERE.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.794
NO, YOU HAVE
TO TAKE HIM WITH YOU.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.724
I HOPE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO
FUCK YOU UP WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.857
NOT WHEN
HE'S LIKE THIS.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.691
DID YOU KNOW I TAUGHT DAVID
HOW TO MASTURBATE ?

38:23.700 --> 38:27.192
NO, I DIDN'T,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, NATE ?

38:27.200 --> 38:28.758
THAT'S FASCINATING,
BUT I HAVE TO GO.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.193
NO, NO, NO,
JUST WAIT A SEC.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.156
I JUST WANT TO
SAY GOODBYE, COME HERE.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.755
OH, GOD !

38:36.830 --> 38:39.321
I LOVE YOU
SO FUCKING MUCH.

38:39.330 --> 38:40.627
YOU'RE SO
FUCKING HIGH.

38:40.630 --> 38:42.951
BUT HOW DID
I GET THAT WAY ?

38:42.960 --> 38:44.951
YOU DON'T JUST
GET HIGH OUT OF NOWHERE.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.848
YOU HAVE TO TAKE DRUGS,
I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING.

38:46.860 --> 38:48.020
DID YOU
TAKE ANY ASPIRIN ?

38:48.030 --> 38:49.452
YEAH.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.395
I THINK THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
A STRAY TAB OF ECSTASY

38:52.400 --> 38:54.891
IN THE ASPIRIN BOTTLE
IN THE KITCHEN CABINET.

38:59.360 --> 39:02.921
OH, DEAR,
CALL ME WHEN YOU CRASH.

39:02.930 --> 39:05.626
NO, CALL ME
AFTER YOU'VE CRASHED.

39:05.630 --> 39:07.518
YOU KNOW WHAT,
CALL ME NEXT WEEK.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.999
I HOPE YOU LIKE HER.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.595
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT YOU LIKE HER.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.420
I DO LIKE HER.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.649
'CAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONLY BROTHER I HAVE.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.857
Time to kiss your sweet ass
goodbye, cupcake.

39:33.860 --> 39:35.589
YEAH, SLICE HER UP !

39:35.600 --> 39:37.625
THAT WAS HOSTILE.

39:37.630 --> 39:39.325
( screaming )

39:39.330 --> 39:42.993
ISN'T THAT THE GIRL
THAT YOU GUYS ARE BURYING ?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.729
SHE'S HOT.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.119
SHE'S HOT AND DEAD.

39:47.130 --> 39:48.927
( chopping )

39:49.760 --> 39:51.955
This _calls for someone
With experience.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.393
Someone who knows her way
around Griffith Park.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.095
Well, that's me !

39:55.100 --> 39:57.125
In the daytime !

40:00.200 --> 40:03.624
If God gave me the ingredients
and told me to make a woman,

40:03.630 --> 40:06.656
I'd make her
just like my wife.

40:06.660 --> 40:08.059
( screaming )

40:10.860 --> 40:13.192
They lost no time in tucking
into the wonderful meal

40:13.200 --> 40:14.849
Boris had
prepared for them.

40:14.860 --> 40:17.294
And then,
there was a dessert.

40:17.300 --> 40:19.450
Hey, I guess Boris
knows I always like

40:19.460 --> 40:21.758
to have lettuce for dessert,
don't you, Boris ?

40:21.760 --> 40:25.491
I hope the meal
was satisfactory.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.320
(female laughing )

40:27.330 --> 40:28.991
(female on tv)
Oh, it was delightful, Boris.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.558
You're a wonderful cook.

40:30.560 --> 40:34.428
( male on tv)
It was nothing, Martha,
straight out of the cookbook.

40:34.430 --> 40:38.457
( other male on tv)
It was yummy, Boris,
I couldn't eat another thing.

40:38.460 --> 40:41.452
Yeah, it's not bad
for a first effort, hey ?

40:41.460 --> 40:43.451
( groaning )

40:44.600 --> 40:45.953
FUCK.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.724
Where's all your old junk ?
Where are your tools ?

40:57.630 --> 40:59.552
( music playing )

40:59.560 --> 41:01.551
(female laughing )

41:19.700 --> 41:22.555
( music playing louder)

41:31.960 --> 41:33.222
BUDDY BOY !

41:33.230 --> 41:35.551
( laughing )

41:43.060 --> 41:45.051
C'MON, WE SAVED
A PLACE FOR YOU.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.518
CHINESE CHECKERS.

41:52.530 --> 41:55.397
I ALWAYS
HATED THIS GAME.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.095
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU NEVER
PLAYED IT FOR MONEY.

42:01.460 --> 42:04.122
NATE, I WANT YOU TO MEET
A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OF MINE.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.825
THIS...

42:05.830 --> 42:08.628
WELL, THIS IS THE MAN.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.593
DEATH.

42:11.600 --> 42:14.592
THE GRIM REAPER.

42:15.860 --> 42:16.827
CIGAR ?

42:16.830 --> 42:18.752
UH, NO, THANKS.

42:18.760 --> 42:19.920
GOOD FOR YOU, BABY.

42:19.930 --> 42:21.397
THAT STUFF IS NASTY.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.494
AND THIS, WELL,
THIS IS--

42:24.500 --> 42:25.819
MY PARTNER.

42:25.830 --> 42:27.525
OOH, THAT SOUNDS
SO PROFESSIONAL,

42:27.530 --> 42:28.622
I LOVE IT.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.598
LIFE.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.295
SHUT UP.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.824
OH, YEAH.

42:33.830 --> 42:35.593
IT'S A WHOLE
YIN-YANG THING.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.454
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU TWO
ARE IN BUSINESS TOGETHER ?

42:37.460 --> 42:41.794
HONEY, ME AND HIM ARE IN
ALL KINDS OF SHIT TOGETHER.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.950
LET'S JUST SAY
IT'S A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL...

42:43.960 --> 42:45.928
ARRANGEMENT.

42:45.930 --> 42:47.989
IT'S YOUR TURN.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.059
UH...

42:50.060 --> 42:53.325
SHOULDN'T I WAIT FOR YOU
TO START A NEW GAME ?

42:53.330 --> 42:55.821
THIS GAME
AIN'T NEVER GONNA END.

42:55.830 --> 42:57.821
YOU'RE EITHER
IN THE GAME

42:58.460 --> 43:00.394
OR YOU'RE OUT OF IT.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.494
ON OR OFF THE BUS,
IF YOU'D PREFER.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.695
ALRIGHT, I'M IN.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.953
YOU GOTTA PUT SOMETHING
IN THE KITTY, SON.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.121
WHAT ARE YOU BETTING ?

43:13.130 --> 43:14.927
( together )
EVERYTHING.

43:14.930 --> 43:16.158
ALRIGHT.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.458
I'LL BET EVERYTHING,
WHATEVER !

43:28.560 --> 43:30.255
OH, WOO-HOO,
I'M SHAKING.

43:30.260 --> 43:31.818
HEY, BUDDY BOY, NO, NO.

43:31.830 --> 43:34.253
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
THIS GUY MAD, BELIEVE ME.

43:34.260 --> 43:35.852
OH, I DON'T GET MAD.

43:35.860 --> 43:37.691
I HAVE PEOPLE
WHO DO IT FOR ME.

43:37.700 --> 43:40.498
( laughing )

43:40.500 --> 43:43.651
( growling )

43:46.660 --> 43:48.127
SHOW-OFF.

43:48.130 --> 43:52.021
BUT THAT ALWAYS
GETS ME GOING.

43:52.030 --> 43:55.693
YOU WANNA FUCK ME,
PUPPETHEAD ?

43:55.700 --> 43:58.260
( growling )

44:06.800 --> 44:08.495
MAMA.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.953
YEAH, BABY.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.655
THAT'S IT.

44:13.660 --> 44:17.027
GO TO TOWN,
BIG DADDY.

44:17.030 --> 44:20.329
(various animal sounds )

44:24.230 --> 44:26.323
BIG COSMIC MYSTERY.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.594
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

44:28.600 --> 44:32.058
CAN'T SAY YOUR OLD MAN NEVER
TOOK YOU ANY PLACE INTERESTING.

44:34.060 --> 44:35.527
YEAH, BUT I'M HIGH.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.323
I KNOW I'M HIGH.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.893
ALL THAT LIVES,

44:42.900 --> 44:45.198
LIVES FOREVER.

44:45.200 --> 44:48.795
ONLY THE SHELL,
THE PERISHABLE PASSES AWAY.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.722
( Grim Reaper )
OH FUCK, YEAH !

44:50.730 --> 44:52.425
THE SPIRIT
IS WITHOUT END,

44:52.430 --> 44:55.126
ETERNAL,

44:55.130 --> 44:57.849
DEATH LESS.

45:00.100 --> 45:01.920
( male on tv)
I'll take this
over here,

45:01.930 --> 45:05.627
put it on like so.

45:05.630 --> 45:07.894
(female on tv)
Look at that, folks, look at
that for a holiday dinner.

45:07.900 --> 45:10.152
If we had some
mint jelly...

45:10.160 --> 45:13.789
that would be fabulous.

45:13.800 --> 45:15.552
Unbelievable !

45:15.560 --> 45:18.597
Do all I get to do
is smell it ?

45:18.600 --> 45:20.898
Can we, can we ?

45:20.900 --> 45:24.654
Oh, smell this,
Isn't that wonderful ?

45:24.660 --> 45:26.150
Oh, boy.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.797
( phone ringing )

45:37.930 --> 45:39.056
( male )
Hello ?

45:39.060 --> 45:41.255
OH, NO,
DID I WAKE YOU ?

45:41.260 --> 45:42.989
DAVID ?

45:43.000 --> 45:45.218
YEAH, YOU DID.

45:45.230 --> 45:47.152
WHAT'S UP ?

45:48.630 --> 45:50.951
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR INVITING ME OUT

45:50.960 --> 45:52.848
WITH YOU AND EDDIE YESTERDAY,
AFTER CHURCH.

45:52.860 --> 45:54.623
YEAH, OKAY.

45:54.630 --> 45:56.689
And to tell you that

45:56.700 --> 46:00.227
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT
WE'VE REMAINED FRIENDS, AND...

46:00.230 --> 46:04.291
If you'd ever like
to do something,

46:04.300 --> 46:07.019
YOU KNOW, JUST THE TWO OF US,
WELL, I'D REALLY LIKE THAT.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.157
LOOK, DAVID.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.390
I'M HAPPY THAT
WE'RE FRIENDS,

46:13.830 --> 46:15.388
A good one.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.698
I KNOW.

46:17.700 --> 46:20.851
YOU AND ME,
IT AIN'T HAPPENING.

46:20.860 --> 46:22.851
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

46:22.860 --> 46:24.452
IT'S JUST KIND
OF HARD FOR ME

46:24.460 --> 46:26.451
TO BE AROUND
YOU AND EDDIE TOGETHER.

46:26.460 --> 46:28.325
YEAH, WELL, YOU NEED
TO GET OVER THAT.

46:28.330 --> 46:29.649
JESUS, KEITH.

46:29.660 --> 46:31.594
COULD YOU BE A LITTLE MORE
SELF-RIGHTEOUS ?

46:44.700 --> 46:46.156
MORNING, MOM.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.320
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

46:47.330 --> 46:50.254
I'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE
SLEEPING RECENTLY.

46:50.260 --> 46:51.557
NOT SURE WHY.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.750
WHERE'S NIKOLAI ?

47:01.760 --> 47:03.421
HOME.

47:03.430 --> 47:05.557
HE DIDN'T STAY OVER ?

47:05.560 --> 47:07.755
OF COURSE NOT.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.825
YOU KNOW, MOM,

47:11.830 --> 47:15.220
IF YOU DID WANT FOR HIM
TO STAY OVER,

47:15.230 --> 47:16.720
THAT WOULD
BE YOUR RIGHT.

47:16.730 --> 47:18.220
I KNOW THAT.

47:18.230 --> 47:19.959
I DON'T
NEED YOUR PERMISSION.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.825
NO, YOU DON'T,
NOR DO I NEED YOURS.

47:21.830 --> 47:25.152
OF COURSE NOT.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.657
YOU HAD A TERRIBLE TIME
LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T YOU ?

47:36.160 --> 47:37.491
KIND OF.

47:39.960 --> 47:41.325
I DID IT FOR YOU.

47:41.330 --> 47:42.991
ARRANGED
THE WHOLE EVENING.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.126
WHY ?

47:44.130 --> 47:45.688
OH, SOME STUPID BOOK
TOLD ME TO.

47:45.700 --> 47:47.224
WELL,
TH ROW THAT BOOK AWAY.

47:47.230 --> 47:48.197
I INTEND TO.

47:50.230 --> 47:52.653
DOES NATE HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH DRUGS NOW ?

47:52.660 --> 47:55.424
IS THIS SOMETHING
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ?

47:55.430 --> 47:57.853
NO, I THINK HE TOOK IT
BY ACCIDENT.

47:57.860 --> 48:00.158
HOW CAN SOMETHING
LIKE THAT BE AN ACCIDENT ?

48:05.530 --> 48:09.591
REBECCA MILFORD'S STAR
SHONE ALL TOO BRIEFLY.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.797
BUT, OH,
HOW BRIGHTLY IT SHONE.

48:12.800 --> 48:15.223
THIS IS REALLY BORING.

48:15.230 --> 48:18.324
HOW VERY,
VERY BRIGHTLY INDEED.

48:18.330 --> 48:22.118
NO, IT'S HILARIOUS,
IS WHAT IT IS.

48:22.130 --> 48:24.951
GABE, A GIRL DIED.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.827
SO WHAT ?

48:27.830 --> 48:29.798
EVERYBODY DIES.

48:37.330 --> 48:39.389
WHAT THE HELL WAS ECSTASY
DOING IN THE ASPIRIN BOTTLE ?

48:39.400 --> 48:40.924
IS THAT CLAIRE'S IDEA
OF A JOKE ?

48:40.930 --> 48:44.229
I THINK I MIGHT
HAVE LEFT IT IN THERE.

48:47.260 --> 48:49.148
WELL, WHERE
DID YOU GET IT ?

48:49.160 --> 48:50.752
YOU REMEMBER
THE SQUARE-DANCING GUY ?

48:55.830 --> 48:57.923
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD GET SOME MORE ?

49:05.930 --> 49:08.490
I WROTE SOMETHING
ABOUT BECKY

49:08.500 --> 49:11.754
THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE
WITH EVERYONE HERE.

49:20.530 --> 49:23.693
TINY VENUS

49:23.700 --> 49:30.253
YOUR BREATH, LIKE
BABY RABBITS ON A FIELD

49:30.260 --> 49:35.596
ABUZZ WITH
BEES AND LIFE

49:35.600 --> 49:40.526
LITTLE DID YOU KNOW
HOW BRIEFLY

49:40.530 --> 49:47.891
THE SUN WOULD SHINE UPON
YOUR OWN PRIVATE UTOPIA

49:47.900 --> 49:54.499
YOUR CANDLE MAY
HAVE BEEN BLOWN OUT

49:54.500 --> 49:59.051
BUT YOU HANG
IN THE AIR

49:59.060 --> 50:05.124
LIKE SMOKE

50:07.060 --> 50:08.721
( male )
RIGHT ON,
THAT'S MY MAN.

50:15.500 --> 50:17.491
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING DOWN HERE ?

50:20.560 --> 50:23.654
IT WAS A STUPID IDEA OF ME
TO GO TO A FUNERAL FOR FUN.

50:26.300 --> 50:28.495
YEAH, WHO TRIED
TO TELL YOU THAT ?

50:28.500 --> 50:31.754
OKAY, SO,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.057
ARE YOU OKAY ?

50:33.060 --> 50:34.322
I'M FINE.

50:34.330 --> 50:35.592
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO-- ?!

50:35.600 --> 50:37.124
I'M NOT A PET !

50:37.130 --> 50:38.495
I'M NOT YOUR PET !

50:38.500 --> 50:39.797
I'M SORRY.

50:39.800 --> 50:42.098
I'M GOING HOME.

50:45.930 --> 50:48.296
ANGIE, YOU SAID YOU GUYS
WERE ALL PITCHING IN TOGETHER

50:48.300 --> 50:49.597
TO PAY FOR THIS.

50:49.600 --> 50:52.194
HEY, I PAID MY 600 BUCKS
AND I'M NOT PAYING A PENNY MORE.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.020
DO YOU KNOW HOW RUDE
THAT GIRL WAS TO ME ?

50:54.030 --> 50:56.351
DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA
MAKE ME LOOK TO NATE AND DAVID ?

50:56.360 --> 50:58.521
SO, GO TALK TO BRODY.

50:58.530 --> 51:00.259
HE'S THE ONE WHO SUPPOSEDLY
CAN'T COME UP WITH HIS SHARE.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.352
HEY.

51:01.360 --> 51:02.896
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT
THIS FUNERAL HERE.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.049
SO?

51:04.060 --> 51:06.927
SO, MAYBE YOU NEED TO COME UP
WITH THE DIFFERENCE.

51:06.930 --> 51:10.058
MAYBE YOU NEED
TO GET OFF MY CASE,

51:10.060 --> 51:12.290
CONSIDERING I JUST
GAVE YOUR WIFE $500

51:12.300 --> 51:14.518
SO SHE COULD PAY
FOR FUCKING DIAPERS !

51:14.760 --> 51:16.694
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

51:16.700 --> 51:18.349
OH, YOU HEARD ME.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.794
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

51:20.800 --> 51:22.256
SHE ASKED ME FOR IT.

51:24.130 --> 51:26.325
( Spanish )

51:42.300 --> 51:43.892
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

51:46.460 --> 51:48.052
THIS WAY...

51:48.060 --> 51:51.223
SH E'LL ALWAYS
BE A PART OF US.

51:51.230 --> 51:53.721
YOU FUCKING MORON.

51:53.730 --> 51:56.449
YOU'RE ALL
FUCKING MORONS.

51:56.460 --> 52:00.556
YOU'RE ALL SUCH
INCREDIBLY STUPID LOSERS.

52:00.560 --> 52:01.788
WHOA.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.290
CHILL.

52:03.300 --> 52:04.449
YOU PEOPLE ARE
FUCKING DISGUSTING.

52:04.460 --> 52:05.654
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU ?

52:05.660 --> 52:06.888
FUCKING BUNCH
OF JUNKIES !

52:06.900 --> 52:08.049
CLAIRE,
THIS IS NOT COOL.

52:08.060 --> 52:09.698
DID YOU SEE WHAT THESE PEOPLE
ARE FUCKING DOING ?

52:09.700 --> 52:11.099
HEY, I KNOW
THEY ARE, OKAY ?

52:11.100 --> 52:12.453
BUT THIS IS OUR BUSINESS,
THESE ARE OUR CLIENTS.

52:12.460 --> 52:13.791
THIS IS THEIR FUNERAL,
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.153
YEAH, WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU
BACK HERE REAL SOON,

52:15.160 --> 52:16.889
AND THEY'LL BE
SNORTING YOU NEXT TIME.

52:20.530 --> 52:22.725
"ALL THAT LIVES,
LIVES FOREVER."

52:22.730 --> 52:27.121
"ONLY THE SHELL,
THE PERISHABLE, PASSES AWAY.

52:27.130 --> 52:30.156
"THE SPIRIT IS...

52:30.160 --> 52:34.119
( together )
WITHOUT END,
ETERNAL, DEATHLESS."

52:35.100 --> 52:38.228
YEAH, IT'S
THE BHAGAVAD-GITA.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.999
REALLY ?

52:41.000 --> 52:42.797
YEAH.

52:44.730 --> 52:45.958
WELL, I'VE NEVER
READ IT.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.120
YOU READ IT
AT MY HOUSE.

52:47.130 --> 52:48.791
I DON'T THINK SO.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.097
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ?

52:50.100 --> 52:51.897
AND I WENT
ON AND ON AND ON

52:51.900 --> 52:54.949
ABOUT THE PETER BROOK PRODUCTION
OF THE MAHABARATA IN LONDON ?

52:56.960 --> 52:58.928
HMM ?

52:58.930 --> 53:02.149
BUT IT FELT
SO PROFOUND.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.195
AND NOW,
YOU'RE TELLING IT ME

53:03.200 --> 53:04.929
IT WAS JUST RECYCLED CRAP
FROM MY BRAIN ?

53:04.930 --> 53:07.023
FROM YOUR
DRUG-ADDLED BRAIN.

53:08.800 --> 53:11.121
( phone ringing )

53:14.430 --> 53:16.193
HELLO ?

53:16.200 --> 53:19.158
So, were you just
not going to tell me

53:19.160 --> 53:20.491
or did you just forget ?

53:20.500 --> 53:22.650
FORGET WHAT ?

53:22.660 --> 53:25.527
A CERTAIN TEST
YOU TOOK RECENTLY.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.524
They posted
the results today.

53:29.530 --> 53:31.418
CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

53:35.700 --> 53:37.895
YOU GOTTA
BE SHITTING ME.

53:37.900 --> 53:40.095
I'm looking at your name,
plain as day.

53:40.100 --> 53:42.455
Nathaniel Samuel
Fisher Jr.

53:42.460 --> 53:45.998
I HAD TOTALLY
FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.157
I'M PROUD OF YOU, NATE.

53:52.860 --> 53:54.555
THAN KS.

53:56.030 --> 53:57.657
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

53:59.830 --> 54:01.422
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

54:01.430 --> 54:03.955
I HAVE A CLIENT
AT 8:30.

54:03.960 --> 54:06.599
THAT'S A LITTLE LATE,
ISN'T IT ?

54:06.600 --> 54:09.057
NO, IT'S NOT
THAT LATE.

54:09.060 --> 54:11.597
CAN I COME OVER LATER ?

54:12.730 --> 54:15.198
NOT TONIGHT, OKAY ?

54:18.360 --> 54:22.524
I'M HAVING ENOUGH TROUBLE JUST
BEING WITH MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

54:22.530 --> 54:25.226
I'M SORRY,
IT'S NOT YOU.

54:28.260 --> 54:29.625
IT'S ME.

54:29.630 --> 54:31.154
I'M FUCKED UP.

54:35.800 --> 54:38.155
YOU CAN'T FIX IT.

56:03.900 --> 56:05.697
YOU'RE IN THE GAME NOW,
BUDDY BOY.

56:07.460 --> 56:09.018
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT.
