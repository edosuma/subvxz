00:05.471 --> 00:08.502
Mr. Quinn,
I understand you are interested

00:08.504 --> 00:10.238
in purchasing The Key.

00:10.273 --> 00:12.674
Ted Roark gave this to me.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.242
I worked at FULCRUM
for ten years

00:14.260 --> 00:17.345
and this is all I have
to show for it.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.981
Of course, the only person
who can use it is

00:20.016 --> 00:21.299
someone with an Intersect.

00:21.350 --> 00:24.152
I have one of my very own,

00:24.187 --> 00:26.321
but the damn
thing's glitchy;

00:26.355 --> 00:27.756
either it cooks
your brain

00:27.790 --> 00:29.191
or it steals your memories.

00:29.225 --> 00:31.726
And I need The Key to fix it.

00:31.761 --> 00:33.478
Interesting.

00:33.529 --> 00:36.264
Edgar, keep that
to yourself.

00:36.299 --> 00:38.767
I have a few enemies.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.361 --> 01:07.729
You do realize that's only one
part of The Key?

01:07.763 --> 01:08.830
There are two other pieces.

01:10.166 --> 01:11.233
I do.

01:11.267 --> 01:12.901
My sources tell me
a former member of The Ring

01:12.935 --> 01:15.837
acquired one from Volkoff
a few years back.

01:15.871 --> 01:17.639
The Ring.

01:17.673 --> 01:19.207
What amateurs.

01:25.948 --> 01:27.349
Edgar...

01:28.384 --> 01:31.653
...do you still carry that
Walther under your jacket?

01:31.687 --> 01:33.421
Of course.
Why do you ask?

01:39.962 --> 01:41.029
Sarah...

01:43.432 --> 01:46.167
You're upset... I can tell.

01:46.202 --> 01:47.836
You stole my memories

01:47.870 --> 01:49.971
and you ruined my life.

02:02.318 --> 02:05.203
Sarah...

02:05.237 --> 02:06.688
I'm still alive.

02:07.723 --> 02:10.859
Come on.

02:10.893 --> 02:12.227
Go for the gun.

02:12.261 --> 02:14.362
You're so close.

02:14.397 --> 02:15.246
Go for the gun.

02:57.707 --> 02:59.240
Good morning.

02:59.275 --> 03:01.209
Morgan...
I know you're feeling down

03:01.243 --> 03:02.177
and I know
you miss Sarah,

03:02.211 --> 03:03.345
but it's time to
get out of bed.

03:03.379 --> 03:04.346
She's gone, man.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.380
Sarah's gone.

03:05.414 --> 03:07.282
Out of bed, Chuck.

03:07.316 --> 03:09.300
You are getting
Sarah back today.

03:09.352 --> 03:11.269
What? What?

03:11.303 --> 03:13.221
She doesn't
remember me, okay?

03:13.255 --> 03:15.023
Or you or us or any of it.

03:15.057 --> 03:16.958
How many people are in
my room right now?

03:16.992 --> 03:17.659
Dude...

03:17.693 --> 03:18.660
you can do this.

03:18.694 --> 03:19.661
You can get Sarah back.

03:19.695 --> 03:21.329
Even Clara agrees.

03:21.364 --> 03:22.797
Hi, Clara.

03:22.832 --> 03:24.065
Think about it.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.500
Every impossible mission
starts with what?

03:25.534 --> 03:28.169
James Bond taking that giant
step and getting out of bed.

03:28.204 --> 03:30.572
First of all, you're mixing
your spy metaphors.

03:30.606 --> 03:33.908
Second, if you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly James Bond.

03:33.942 --> 03:36.378
I'm actually no longer a spy
and I lost my wife.

03:36.412 --> 03:38.213
I'm back where
I was before:

03:38.247 --> 03:39.214
alone in Burbank.

03:39.248 --> 03:40.215
You are not alone.

03:40.249 --> 03:41.316
You have us.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.817
And you are not the person
you were five years ago.

03:42.852 --> 03:45.220
You are so much more.
Yeah, there you go, big guy.

03:45.254 --> 03:47.155
One sit-up closer
to getting the girl back.

03:47.189 --> 03:48.473
Guys, this is crazy, okay?

03:48.507 --> 03:51.059
I tried to get her to
remember me and it didn't work.

03:51.093 --> 03:53.161
I can't get her to fall in love
with me again.

03:53.195 --> 03:55.330
Chuck, it's clear
that we can't

03:55.364 --> 03:59.501
force Sarah to remember--
but emotions, feelings,

03:59.535 --> 04:01.202
those are powerful things.

04:01.237 --> 04:03.338
And if you can
find Sarah,

04:03.372 --> 04:05.440
maybe you can spark
some of these memories.

04:05.474 --> 04:07.776
Really?

04:07.810 --> 04:10.111
She fell in love
with you before, Chuck.

04:10.146 --> 04:11.112
You can do it again.

04:11.147 --> 04:12.547
She'll remember.

04:12.581 --> 04:15.417
Do you really think
it could work?

04:15.451 --> 04:18.086
That she could just...

04:18.120 --> 04:20.855
snap out of it?

04:36.939 --> 04:38.790
Yeah, you know what?

04:38.824 --> 04:40.141
You're right.

04:40.176 --> 04:41.108
I-I... I-I can do this.

04:41.127 --> 04:44.162
I took down
The Ring, FULCRUM,

04:44.213 --> 04:45.780
I'm a very impressive
spy for hire.

04:47.633 --> 04:51.469
<i>We fell in love once,</i>
<i>we can do it again.</i>

04:51.504 --> 04:52.620
She'll remember.

04:52.638 --> 04:53.805
That's what I'm
talking about.

04:53.839 --> 04:55.089
That's the spirit.

04:55.123 --> 04:56.124
Wow, I just said that.

04:56.158 --> 04:59.160
I mean, she may be
the best spy in the world,

04:59.178 --> 05:00.161
but I'm Chuck Bartowski.

05:00.196 --> 05:02.864
It's not like
she's out of my league.

05:07.436 --> 05:09.637
<i>I can do it.</i>

05:09.672 --> 05:11.773
I can get Sarah Walker back.

Your target is Nicholas Quinn.

05:24.137 --> 05:26.018
I take it you don't want
him alive.

05:26.019 --> 05:28.016
No, I want him very dead.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.157
Done.

05:30.191 --> 05:31.683
I'm ready to go.

05:31.684 --> 05:33.084
Are you?

05:33.119 --> 05:36.254
Carmichael Industries dropped
the ball on this already.

05:36.289 --> 05:39.491
Five years in Burbank
could turn a man into butter.

05:39.525 --> 05:42.761
But for this job,
I need you ruthless.

05:42.795 --> 05:46.097
Anything less
and you'll get killed.

05:46.132 --> 05:48.733
I need Old Casey,
my best agent.

05:48.768 --> 05:49.834
I need the Colonel.

05:58.477 --> 06:01.279
I can do it.

06:01.314 --> 06:02.897
Yeah, but look, it's not just
about finding Sarah,

06:02.948 --> 06:04.683
it's about finding her
and having a plan

06:04.717 --> 06:05.717
for what to do next.

06:05.751 --> 06:07.719
Chuck, this is
your mission, okay?

06:07.753 --> 06:10.255
Find Sarah, be yourself.

06:10.289 --> 06:11.790
Be myself? Be myself?

06:11.824 --> 06:13.792
Okay, well...

06:13.826 --> 06:14.959
what version of myself?

06:14.994 --> 06:17.395
Lord of the Nerd Herd or
charming Charles Carmichael?

06:17.430 --> 06:18.697
No, the guy
that she fell for.

06:18.731 --> 06:20.398
Yeah,
I agree with that.

06:20.433 --> 06:21.433
Also, I have
another notion.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.101
I think that you
should kiss her.

06:23.135 --> 06:25.704
Did you...

06:25.738 --> 06:26.871
I'm sorry, what?

06:26.889 --> 06:27.872
Kiss her.

06:27.907 --> 06:29.240
Grab this woman
and kiss her.

06:29.275 --> 06:30.208
Just kiss her.

06:30.242 --> 06:31.743
That's the whole plan?

06:31.777 --> 06:33.078
Yeah, pretty much.
And, yes, I've been watching

06:33.112 --> 06:35.413
a ton of Disney princess
movies with baby Clara, but...

06:35.448 --> 06:37.382
I firmly believe,
with all my heart,

06:37.416 --> 06:38.549
that one magical kiss from you

06:38.567 --> 06:40.752
could unlock
all of Sarah's memories. I do.

06:40.786 --> 06:43.488
Enough with the crazy.

06:43.522 --> 06:44.789
- Exactly.
- We're wagging the dog here.

06:44.824 --> 06:46.491
Okay, we got
to find Sarah first.

06:46.525 --> 06:49.894
But how do you find a woman
who doesn't want to be found?

06:50.863 --> 06:51.729
Can we find women?

06:51.747 --> 06:53.198
Can we find women?

06:53.232 --> 06:54.532
Are you kidding me?

06:54.566 --> 06:57.168
We can find a woman
off the discarded remnants

06:57.203 --> 06:58.753
of an Outback
Bloomin' Onion.

07:00.072 --> 07:01.940
Unleash the perverts.

07:01.974 --> 07:03.741
Stalk, it's Gawk,
I got your specs.

07:03.759 --> 07:04.876
Gawker, it's Stalker.

07:04.910 --> 07:06.745
We need a bead on a big,
blonde bird, please.

07:06.779 --> 07:08.012
Sounds like a job
for the DirtDog.

07:08.047 --> 07:10.849
Up and hot, Gawk; I'll
get a bead on your bird.

07:10.883 --> 07:12.217
Go Twinkie.
Go Twinkie.

07:12.251 --> 07:13.885
My Twitter feed shows
multiple reports...

07:19.725 --> 07:21.693
Use the breadcrumbs,
nab that Gretel.

07:21.727 --> 07:22.694
Sniff it out. Sniff it out.
You got it.

07:22.728 --> 07:24.896
You heard him,
use your sniffers.

07:24.930 --> 07:25.764
Tall blonde with amazing...

07:25.798 --> 07:27.198
...falsely I.D.'d
as Uma Thurman...

07:27.233 --> 07:27.866
...gorgeous profile...

07:27.900 --> 07:29.067
Follow that bird in flight.

07:29.101 --> 07:29.734
Thank you, Jeffery.

07:29.768 --> 07:30.802
Okay, Lester.
Jeffery.

07:30.836 --> 07:32.437
Lester.
Jeffery.

07:32.471 --> 07:33.538
What's happening here?

07:33.572 --> 07:34.606
She landed

07:34.640 --> 07:35.807
at LAX at 9:34 last night.

07:35.841 --> 07:37.208
She's en route to Burbank.

07:37.243 --> 07:39.444
In tight blue jeans
and a cleavage-enhancing top.

07:39.478 --> 07:40.478
Meow.

07:40.513 --> 07:41.479
H-How do you know that?

07:41.514 --> 07:42.480
Target spotted

07:42.515 --> 07:43.915
at an Internet cafe.
Sh, sh, sh!

07:43.949 --> 07:45.817
Web history shows search
for a Carmichael industries.

07:45.851 --> 07:49.888
Positive I.D. on one
Sarah Walker in this Buy More,

07:49.922 --> 07:51.389
at the Nerd Herd Desk.

07:51.424 --> 07:52.390
I'm sorry...

07:52.425 --> 07:54.526
no nipslips
nor pokey peaks.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.194
I'm sorry, wait, what?

07:56.228 --> 07:57.395
She's here now?

07:57.430 --> 07:59.431
Mm-hmm.
No nipslips.

08:31.830 --> 08:33.731
Hi, Sarah.

08:33.765 --> 08:35.033
Hi.

08:35.067 --> 08:39.102
I didn't know whether
I should ring the bell.

08:39.138 --> 08:41.239
What are you, what are you,
what are you doing here?

08:41.273 --> 08:43.707
I'm sorry, let me
try that one again.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.860
It is really great to see you.

08:45.895 --> 08:47.245
It really, really, really is.

08:47.279 --> 08:48.480
You look fantastic.

08:48.514 --> 08:49.881
Of course, you always
look fantastic.

08:49.915 --> 08:51.749
That's-that's-that's
kind of your thing.

08:51.784 --> 08:53.851
So, with that,

08:53.869 --> 08:55.653
what are you doing here?

08:55.688 --> 08:57.822
Your spy base.

08:57.857 --> 08:59.591
Castle? Yeah?

08:59.625 --> 09:02.160
I need it.

09:02.194 --> 09:05.196
I lost track of Quinn,
but I know what he wants.

09:05.214 --> 09:07.165
A device called The Key.

09:07.199 --> 09:09.083
An ex-FULCRUM agent
had the first piece.

09:09.134 --> 09:11.903
And a former Ring operative,
Renny Deutch, has the second.

09:11.937 --> 09:14.873
I, uh, read your profile, and
you're good with computers?

09:14.907 --> 09:16.741
Yeah, I can... I can hack
with the best of them.

09:16.775 --> 09:19.744
In fact, back in the day,
they used to call me the...

09:19.778 --> 09:21.779
Doesn't-doesn't really
matter, not important.

09:21.814 --> 09:23.515
You need me to
find Renny? Done.

09:23.549 --> 09:24.582
Great. Thank you.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.106
Hey, there, stranger,
aren't you...

09:50.259 --> 09:51.960
Hi, Sarah.

09:53.012 --> 09:54.596
Morgan. Hi.

09:54.630 --> 09:55.747
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

09:55.781 --> 09:58.316
No, no, it's-it's actually...
it's... it's my fault.

09:58.350 --> 09:59.717
We've actually danced
that dance before,

09:59.751 --> 10:00.918
and I should know...

10:00.936 --> 10:02.787
I should know better
than to sneak up on you.

10:05.124 --> 10:07.158
Can I help you?

10:11.830 --> 10:13.898
No, no, I just wanted
to tell you that, um...

10:13.933 --> 10:16.901
There was a time I was Chuck's
number one go-to best friend.

10:16.936 --> 10:17.936
And then you came along,

10:17.970 --> 10:20.471
and things changed.

10:20.506 --> 10:21.839
I just...if I was to hand

10:21.874 --> 10:23.441
the title off to anyone,

10:23.475 --> 10:25.777
I was always really happy
it was you.

10:25.811 --> 10:28.179
I just wanted you
to know that.

10:28.213 --> 10:29.280
Found him.

10:30.482 --> 10:31.616
Renny Deutch.

10:31.650 --> 10:33.952
German arms dealer,
sets up shop in Berlin.

10:33.986 --> 10:36.454
He's there now,
so we find him, we find Quinn.

10:36.488 --> 10:37.972
All right, looks like
I need a ticket to Berlin.

10:38.007 --> 10:40.491
Mm-hmm.

10:40.526 --> 10:42.960
Go! You gotta
be on this mission.

10:42.978 --> 10:43.978
Uh...

10:44.013 --> 10:46.764
Sarah-- hey-- quick,
quick, uh, quick question

10:46.799 --> 10:48.466
before you go.

10:48.484 --> 10:50.602
Uh, what's your plan
once you find Quinn?

10:50.636 --> 10:51.869
I kill him.

10:51.904 --> 10:53.871
And then I...

10:53.906 --> 10:55.773
I disappear forever.

10:55.808 --> 10:57.542
Really? Really? Wow.

10:57.576 --> 10:59.744
Okay, well, then,
my second question...

10:59.778 --> 11:01.546
I-I-I can't be here.

11:01.580 --> 11:02.747
I don't know how
to be the woman

11:02.781 --> 11:03.915
that you
remember me as.

11:03.949 --> 11:06.918
All I remember is being a spy--
a good one.

11:06.952 --> 11:08.886
It's all I know how to do.

11:08.921 --> 11:10.488
I understand that.

11:10.522 --> 11:13.825
I-I-I get that,
but... I can help.

11:13.859 --> 11:14.726
If you go
to Berlin alone,

11:14.760 --> 11:16.060
you're just going
to get yourself killed,

11:16.095 --> 11:18.796
but me and my team,
we-we can...

11:19.832 --> 11:22.000
Yes, I'm small,

11:22.034 --> 11:24.052
but I'm worth three spies
on a mission

11:24.103 --> 11:25.803
and I'm a very
good listener.

11:25.838 --> 11:27.338
With us, you stand a chance.

11:27.373 --> 11:28.740
Look, you don't have
the Intersect anymore,

11:28.774 --> 11:30.308
and you haven't been trained.

11:30.342 --> 11:31.909
<i>am</i>    trained.
I have been trained.

11:31.944 --> 11:33.244
You trained me.
You were my handler.

11:33.278 --> 11:35.846
Okay.

11:35.864 --> 11:37.515
Do you know how
to use this?

11:39.318 --> 11:42.487
Uh...

11:42.521 --> 11:45.490
Yeah, I can handle
a Desert Eagle,

11:45.524 --> 11:47.909
'cause I'm
a stone-cold spy.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.927
That's me. I'm lethal.

11:49.962 --> 11:52.029
You'll need to be.

11:52.047 --> 11:54.082
Let's go.

12:12.335 --> 12:13.673
What if I have
to use this thing?

12:13.674 --> 12:14.825
Don't do that.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.092
Sarah fell in love with you--

12:16.127 --> 12:17.427
in part--
for not shooting people.

12:17.461 --> 12:18.762
Please remember that.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.715
Okay, Renny just arrived.

12:21.766 --> 12:23.683
We need to follow him until
he makes contact with Quinn,

12:23.718 --> 12:24.851
then we take them both out.

12:24.886 --> 12:26.536
Great. Cool.
Sounds like a plan.

12:27.555 --> 12:28.855
Okay, let's go.

12:31.726 --> 12:32.709
Was that okay?

12:32.743 --> 12:34.060
Yeah. Do me a favor.

12:34.111 --> 12:35.845
Don't worry about anything.
Be yourself, okay?

12:35.863 --> 12:37.731
Under no circumstances
do you shoot anybody,

12:37.782 --> 12:39.866
no matter how
dangerous it gets.

12:49.487 --> 12:51.264
El Compadre.
What?

12:51.265 --> 12:53.910
This place looks
just like El Compadre.

12:53.911 --> 12:55.168
It's a...
a Mexican restaurant in L.A.

12:55.169 --> 12:56.953
We went there when we first met.

12:56.987 --> 12:58.721
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

13:00.624 --> 13:02.158
<i>Danke.</i>
<i>Danke.</i>

13:05.835 --> 13:07.168
Perfect, Chuck. This is fate.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.371
See? Maybe Sarah
will remember something.

13:09.405 --> 13:11.539
<i>Just use the old Chuck charm.</i>

13:14.427 --> 13:16.144
So we're just going to follow
these schmucks around?

13:16.178 --> 13:17.479
That's how we're
going to find Quinn?

13:17.513 --> 13:19.481
Don't you sell
Chuck and Sarah short.

13:19.515 --> 13:20.649
They're damn fine operatives.

13:20.683 --> 13:21.883
Yes, sir.

13:27.857 --> 13:29.524
Sarah, this has got to
be some kind of sign.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.409
I mean, think about it--
El Compadre was...

13:31.444 --> 13:33.194
sort of our first date.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.396
Not for you so much.

13:34.430 --> 13:35.830
You were still
just, you know,

13:35.865 --> 13:37.198
being a spy
back then,

13:37.233 --> 13:39.034
but for me, yeah, totally.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.835
I mean, I...

13:40.870 --> 13:43.204
somehow thought
I stumbled on a date

13:43.239 --> 13:45.874
with the most beautiful
woman in the world.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.943
I was so nervous.

13:47.977 --> 13:49.945
And you were so amazing.

13:49.979 --> 13:52.447
We talked and laughed and
had such a great time.

13:52.481 --> 13:54.883
We went dancing afterwards,
and you were doing

13:54.917 --> 13:57.485
these crazy, sexy dance moves.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.954
Chuck, stop.

13:58.988 --> 13:59.955
But it's our story.

13:59.989 --> 14:01.156
Don't you want to hear it?

14:01.190 --> 14:02.857
Chuck, we're on a mission, okay?

14:02.892 --> 14:04.476
The focus is Renny.

14:04.527 --> 14:05.660
That's okay, buddy.

14:05.695 --> 14:07.495
If Sarah doesn't want
to hear the story,

14:07.530 --> 14:08.780
then... then you just focus
on tonight.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.632
You make this mish
as romantic as you can.

14:10.666 --> 14:13.368
You make that girl fall in love
with you all over again.

14:13.402 --> 14:15.070
You're right.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.304
No more stories.

14:16.339 --> 14:18.006
Let's focus on the op.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.375
The buyer's
changing location.

14:20.409 --> 14:22.877
Cancel my enchiladas
rancheros.

14:22.912 --> 14:24.312
We're leaving.

14:24.347 --> 14:26.147
The target's on the move.

14:26.182 --> 14:28.516
Morgan, track
where he's going.

14:28.551 --> 14:30.986
We may need a wardrobe change.

14:38.394 --> 14:40.395

14:42.181 --> 14:45.367
Your tie just needs
a little fixing.

14:45.401 --> 14:46.484
You look great.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.702
Thanks.

14:47.737 --> 14:49.304
Oh, Chuck, this is great.

14:49.338 --> 14:50.438
Russian Consulate mission,
right?

14:50.473 --> 14:52.674
There'll be music and dancing
and sexy outfits.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.142
Listen to me.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.544
You grab her, and you look
in each other's eyes,

14:56.579 --> 14:58.346
and you kiss.

14:58.381 --> 15:00.615
And she'll remember
the last five years, okay?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.384
I promise you.
Now, you can do this!

15:02.418 --> 15:04.002
Okay, I need

I'm gonna get
close to Renny...

15:06.555 --> 15:08.323

Close to Renny.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.778
Renny. Right.

15:40.289 --> 15:42.323
Our buyer's paranoid.

15:42.357 --> 15:44.526
He's changing
the location again.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.543
We have to go.

15:47.329 --> 15:49.297
New location.

16:13.155 --> 16:14.289
Nothing.

16:14.323 --> 16:15.857
Nothing at all.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.525
Attaboy, Chuck.
Play it cool.

16:20.663 --> 16:23.331
Quinn must be running late.

16:23.365 --> 16:25.734
Looks like we have
to do some waiting around.

16:29.939 --> 16:31.072
Sarah, what are you doing?

16:31.090 --> 16:32.874
They're in the wrong order.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.075
What?

16:34.093 --> 16:35.543
Well, that's not how
it should be.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.914
You know this place?

16:43.018 --> 16:45.453
Uh...

16:45.488 --> 16:46.855
No. No, I don't.

No, no, Sarah,

16:48.524 --> 16:49.491
it's-it's... it's okay.

16:49.525 --> 16:50.825
It's, actually,
it's-it's important.

16:50.860 --> 16:51.993
You used to work here.

16:52.027 --> 16:53.461
I mean, not-not
here in Berlin,

16:53.496 --> 16:55.096
but the Wienerlicious
in Burbank.

16:55.131 --> 16:57.098
It was your first cover job.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.633
Come on, you can remember.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.168
Please. Please try.

17:02.037 --> 17:04.005
Touching.

17:08.344 --> 17:10.377
Excuse me.

17:10.412 --> 17:13.214
Mr. Deutch, did you
bring The Key?

17:13.249 --> 17:14.382
I did.

17:14.415 --> 17:15.967
It's going to cost you.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.285
Oh.

17:17.319 --> 17:20.221
The Ring spent a lot of money
acquiring this.

17:22.724 --> 17:24.325
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

17:27.029 --> 17:28.195
Hey!

17:30.833 --> 17:32.984
I never liked The Ring.

17:33.018 --> 17:35.036
One more to go.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.406
I got more targets

17:38.440 --> 17:39.841
inside the Wienerlicious.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.142
Quinn's made his move.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.177
Let's get down there.

17:45.347 --> 17:48.082
This one was in a spy
van across the street.

17:48.117 --> 17:49.117
Spy van?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.451
Really?
It's that obvious?

17:51.487 --> 17:53.955
Drop your guns.

17:58.794 --> 18:00.512
It's Morgan.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.682
Oh, Sarah,

18:04.717 --> 18:06.834
you really don't
remember, do you?

18:06.852 --> 18:08.736
Relax, boys;
these two are mine.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.856
Your husband

18:11.891 --> 18:13.358
is one of the
world's greatest...

18:13.392 --> 18:16.377
What's the word?

18:16.412 --> 18:18.746
Pussies.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.536
Aah!

18:34.063 --> 18:35.029
Chuck, stop him!

18:49.345 --> 18:50.645
Stop!

18:50.679 --> 18:52.063
Stop, Quinn!

18:52.097 --> 18:53.314
Stop!

18:53.349 --> 18:55.316
Don't!
I will shoot you!

18:55.351 --> 18:57.735
Chuck!

18:57.770 --> 18:59.821
Shoot him!

19:02.291 --> 19:03.408
I don't have a clean shot.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.442
Chuck,

19:04.493 --> 19:06.261
shoot him!

19:06.295 --> 19:07.295
Stop!

19:13.285 --> 19:15.169
Hey, we're hit.

19:15.204 --> 19:16.838
Get us down!

19:22.911 --> 19:24.312
Brace! Brace!

19:35.891 --> 19:36.474
Hey.

19:38.227 --> 19:39.427
Is that my Desert Eagle?

19:42.231 --> 19:44.899
You shot down my helicopter
with my own damn gun!

19:44.934 --> 19:46.401
It was more of a warning shot

19:46.435 --> 19:47.535
than anything else.

19:50.372 --> 19:52.340
Sorry, Casey.

19:59.279 --> 20:00.756
Dude, uncuff me!

20:00.757 --> 20:03.192
I want you to tell Alex
something for me.

20:03.227 --> 20:05.194
Tell her I'm going away
for a while.

20:05.229 --> 20:07.530
What the hell is going on here?

20:07.564 --> 20:09.599
Bartowski and
Walker screwed up.

20:09.633 --> 20:11.234
So you arrest your own team?

20:11.268 --> 20:12.802
Old team.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.353
You had him in your sights.

20:14.388 --> 20:16.472
All you had to do
was pull the trigger.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.024
What do you want me to say?

20:18.058 --> 20:19.559
Your mistake cost us
this mission.

20:19.610 --> 20:24.030
You let Quinn get one step
closer to assembling The Key.

20:24.064 --> 20:26.198
Fine, I'll take the hit,

20:26.233 --> 20:28.618
but in my defense,
killing was never  thing.

20:28.652 --> 20:30.286
You're a spy, aren't you?

20:30.320 --> 20:33.189
It was actually one of
the things you liked about me--

20:33.223 --> 20:35.558
the fact that I wouldn't
pull the trigger.

20:39.212 --> 20:42.081
Tell me why you're not returning
Alex's phone calls, okay?

20:42.132 --> 20:43.332
She is worried sick about you.

20:43.366 --> 20:45.434
All she knows is you're gone,
running covert missions.

20:45.469 --> 20:47.169
They call 'em covert,
numb nuts,

20:47.204 --> 20:48.871
because you don't
tell anyone about them.

20:48.906 --> 20:50.006
She's your daughter!

20:50.040 --> 20:51.240
She's a liability.

20:51.275 --> 20:54.010
Wow.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.078
I don't mean that.

20:56.113 --> 20:57.546
Just, I have to be ruthless.

20:57.581 --> 20:59.849
Well, at first, you
thought I was weak

20:59.883 --> 21:01.250
or scared,
and maybe I was.

21:01.285 --> 21:04.020
But you taught me
how to be a spy, Sarah.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.089
And after we...

21:07.124 --> 21:09.125
you know...

21:12.229 --> 21:15.464
After we fell in love,
you stood up for me.

21:15.499 --> 21:17.934
You didn't want me
to be any other spy.

21:17.968 --> 21:19.368
You didn't want
me to change.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.037
<i>What about Chuck and Sarah?</i>

21:21.071 --> 21:22.371
Liability, too, right?

21:22.405 --> 21:25.241
Good. By all means, lock
'em up, throw away the key,

21:25.275 --> 21:26.809
lock away your feelings, too;
forget everything

21:26.843 --> 21:29.111
that we've been through,
and you be ruthless.

21:29.146 --> 21:31.814
You just don't
understand, do you?

21:31.848 --> 21:34.750
I got soft.

21:34.785 --> 21:36.769
I lost my edge.

21:38.689 --> 21:41.223
Your team <i>was</i> your edge,
you giant jackass!

21:41.257 --> 21:42.224
What is wrong with you, man?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.225
You want to find Quinn?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.527
You know who to call,

21:44.561 --> 21:45.995
but don't you dare try
to blame this on us

21:46.029 --> 21:47.363
because you're afraid.

21:47.397 --> 21:49.231
That's right, you're
afraid that, with us,

21:49.266 --> 21:53.169
that's when you're the best,
and that's the truth, man.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.841
That's it?

21:58.875 --> 22:01.777
No response or anything?

22:03.580 --> 22:05.548
Screw it.

22:05.582 --> 22:07.183
Screw what, John?

22:07.217 --> 22:09.385
The court-martial.

22:11.221 --> 22:12.421
I'm in.

22:13.757 --> 22:15.725
What are you...?

22:15.759 --> 22:17.059
I'm free?

22:17.094 --> 22:18.344
You, your wife,
and my little roommate

22:18.395 --> 22:20.963
are going to help me
track down Quinn.

22:20.998 --> 22:22.848
Walker.

22:22.899 --> 22:25.401
You're escaping without me?

22:25.435 --> 22:27.903
Look, I heard your pep talk.

22:27.938 --> 22:30.006
I think I'm better off
hunting Quinn on my own.

22:31.825 --> 22:32.808
No, we're doing
this together.

22:32.843 --> 22:33.976
I'm leaving.

22:34.011 --> 22:35.310
No, no, you're not.

22:35.328 --> 22:36.311
Why?

22:36.329 --> 22:38.481
Because of my mother.

22:38.515 --> 22:40.049
What?
She's a spy.

22:40.083 --> 22:41.417
So?

22:41.451 --> 22:43.652
And she's standing
right behind you with a gun.

22:45.255 --> 22:46.389
Sarah.

22:46.423 --> 22:48.024
Relax.

22:48.058 --> 22:49.175
Chuck, I asked Mom to come...

22:49.209 --> 22:50.659
Mom, why is
there a gun out?

22:50.694 --> 22:54.397
Sorry, dear, old habits.

22:54.431 --> 22:56.098
It's good to see
you again, Sarah.

22:56.133 --> 22:57.933
My name is Mary.

22:57.968 --> 22:59.035
Grandma, what did we say

22:59.069 --> 23:01.404
about Baby Clara
seeing firearms?

23:01.438 --> 23:03.839
It's a no-no.

23:03.874 --> 23:05.174
I am sorry.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.109
Your Mimi loves you.

23:07.144 --> 23:10.513
Chuck, I have
intel on The Key.

23:10.547 --> 23:13.082
Are you staying, Sarah?

23:14.584 --> 23:16.585
Your father originally developed
the Intersect

23:16.620 --> 23:18.687
as a teaching tool.

23:18.705 --> 23:20.706
The Key was the matrix
for programming

23:20.741 --> 23:22.458
the system.

23:22.492 --> 23:23.526
So it could do anything.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.527
Roark, Hartley,

23:24.561 --> 23:25.861
and Stephen split
the pieces

23:25.896 --> 23:27.897
so that no one could alter
the Intersect

23:27.931 --> 23:30.299
without their
agreement.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.334
Your father gave his piece
to someone in the government.

23:34.888 --> 23:38.240
If Quinn puts all three pieces
together, he could fix the bug

23:38.275 --> 23:40.910
that blitzed Sarah
and Morgan's memories

23:40.944 --> 23:41.977
and then upload it into himself.

23:42.012 --> 23:45.081
He could also add
new skills,

23:45.115 --> 23:47.316
new information.

23:47.350 --> 23:50.252
Chuck, we need to talk.

23:53.123 --> 23:55.574
What Mom is talking about
down there is an Intersect

23:55.609 --> 23:59.061
that can create a new identity
or restore an old one.

23:59.096 --> 24:00.229
Oh, my God, you're right.

24:00.263 --> 24:02.698
We could load Sarah's memories
onto The Key.

24:02.732 --> 24:03.699
This could work.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.434
We create a file
on Sarah, okay?

24:05.469 --> 24:07.369
Your wedding album,
her dossier, everything.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.505
All you have to do is get
the Intersect glasses

24:09.539 --> 24:11.507
back from Quinn.

24:11.541 --> 24:13.042
Okay? It's gonna
take a few days,

24:13.076 --> 24:14.443
but I can reprogram
them for Sarah.

24:14.478 --> 24:15.744
You just have to convince her

24:15.779 --> 24:17.046
it's the right
thing to do.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.614
Sis, you're amazing.
This is fantastic news.

24:19.883 --> 24:21.183
Ooh.

24:21.218 --> 24:22.184
Hey.

24:22.219 --> 24:23.585
Chuck.

24:23.603 --> 24:26.105
Quinn was spotted entering
the Pacific Concert Hall.

24:26.139 --> 24:27.857
Beckman's there to meet
with her Chinese counterpart.

24:27.891 --> 24:29.291
Your mother says
Stephen gave The Key

24:29.326 --> 24:30.693
to someone in government.

24:30.727 --> 24:31.694
She's the target.

24:31.728 --> 24:33.129
Beckman has The Key.

24:33.163 --> 24:34.497
We found Quinn.

24:34.531 --> 24:35.798
He's at the
Pacific Concert Hall.

24:35.832 --> 24:37.817
We gotta go.

24:42.005 --> 24:43.973
Pacific Concert Hall.

24:44.007 --> 24:45.241
They need us.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.375

gave it to you.

What an honor.

25:20.076 --> 25:22.178
And all these years,

25:22.212 --> 25:23.779
you never knew
it was the third part

25:23.813 --> 25:25.714
of The Key.

25:31.054 --> 25:32.621
Hey, General, it's Chuck.

25:32.655 --> 25:34.206
We think you might be in danger.

25:34.257 --> 25:36.825
She's in more danger
than you know, Chuck.

25:36.843 --> 25:39.161
It's over.

25:39.196 --> 25:41.197
I win.

25:59.596 --> 26:00.860
General, what have we got here?

26:00.861 --> 26:02.962
There is a bomb
under my chair.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.530
I can't stand up.

26:06.366 --> 26:08.651
Morgan, get the Chinese
delegation out of here.

26:08.702 --> 26:10.002
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mom,

26:10.036 --> 26:12.738
pull up the blueprints to
the hall; we need to evacuate.

26:12.772 --> 26:13.789
Wait, guys,

26:13.823 --> 26:14.840
it looks like a sonic trigger,

26:14.875 --> 26:16.108
probably tied
to the performance.

26:17.811 --> 26:19.295
When the music stops, it goes.
Exactly.

26:21.447 --> 26:22.982
Get everybody
out of here.

26:24.084 --> 26:25.217
No, no, no, no.

26:25.252 --> 26:26.719
We disrupt the performance,
it'll blow up.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.120
That is an order.

26:28.138 --> 26:30.055
General, with all due respect,
shut up.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.307
We're saving you.

26:34.227 --> 26:37.129
I've got something.

26:37.147 --> 26:38.931
Ooh.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.069
Well, if that's the bomb, these
are the brains, and it's locked.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.237

26:45.272 --> 26:46.238
No, not yet.

26:46.273 --> 26:47.239
Chuck,

26:47.274 --> 26:48.240

26:50.010 --> 26:51.143

26:57.350 --> 26:58.867

26:58.919 --> 27:00.152
I need Quinn
to stop this bomb

27:00.186 --> 27:02.204

those glasses for Sarah.

27:02.255 --> 27:04.156
Go, go.

27:09.362 --> 27:10.629

27:10.664 --> 27:13.132
- We're on our way, sir.
- Three minutes.

27:13.166 --> 27:14.600
Morgan.
Yeah.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.068
We gotta keep
the music going.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.069
We can't let it stop.

Casey, Morgan.

Okay, hold on a second,
hold on a second, Casey.

We need him to disarm the bomb.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.132
The bomb?

27:50.937 --> 27:52.221
It can't be stopped.

27:54.274 --> 27:56.542
And it's wired
to explode

27:56.576 --> 27:58.811

36:05.384 --> 36:08.352
So Jeffster! could rock again!

36:13.458 --> 36:17.094
So what you're saying is
Chuck Bartowski is a spy

36:17.128 --> 36:19.513
who runs a spy company
underneath the store.

36:19.565 --> 36:20.765
The exciting part of the story

36:20.799 --> 36:22.016
is that we saved the day.

36:22.067 --> 36:23.367
You didn't get that?
We'll go again.

36:23.402 --> 36:24.435
I got it.

36:24.469 --> 36:25.870
But do I believe it?

36:25.904 --> 36:27.538
Not a word, boys.

36:27.573 --> 36:28.906
Not a word.

36:30.008 --> 36:32.660
Things, though,
are a-changin'.

36:34.413 --> 36:36.280
New owners moving in.

36:36.314 --> 36:37.982
Yep. Looking fresh.

36:38.016 --> 36:40.084
I'm gonna be eating fresh.

36:41.353 --> 36:44.005
We gotta get back to work.

36:44.039 --> 36:45.623
Excuse me.

36:45.657 --> 36:47.875
Are you Scheffester!?

36:47.926 --> 36:49.994
I saw your performance
last night

36:50.012 --> 36:51.495
at the Pacific
Concert Hall.

36:51.513 --> 36:55.333
I'm a very important
record executive from Germany.

36:55.367 --> 36:57.468
You're gonna be stars there.

36:57.502 --> 36:59.503
Women and men will adore you.

36:59.538 --> 37:01.339
Women and men?

37:01.373 --> 37:03.341
Wait... wait a minute.

37:03.375 --> 37:06.844
You want us to leave this store?

37:06.878 --> 37:08.179
Yes. Right now.

37:08.213 --> 37:09.547
Come with me.

37:18.991 --> 37:21.359
Jeffrey...

37:23.028 --> 37:24.996
Are you ready?

37:25.030 --> 37:27.298
Let's rock.

37:29.568 --> 37:31.669
Wunderbar. Come on.

37:40.045 --> 37:41.545
What's the big surprise?

37:41.563 --> 37:43.047
You two moving in together?

37:43.065 --> 37:44.215
We're moving in together!

37:44.249 --> 37:45.349
It's not fun with you.

37:45.384 --> 37:46.684
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

37:46.718 --> 37:47.685
How did you know?

37:47.719 --> 37:49.887
Hello? Spy.

37:49.905 --> 37:51.388
And you're...

37:51.406 --> 37:53.824
Happy that we're
finally taking

37:53.859 --> 37:55.443
this nice, giant
step and...?

37:55.494 --> 37:57.128
Or you're going to shoot me?

37:57.162 --> 37:58.228
Heads up.

37:58.246 --> 38:00.197
The place all is yours.

38:00.232 --> 38:01.399
We're all going
to live together?

38:01.433 --> 38:03.067
No, just the two of you.

38:03.101 --> 38:06.037
I have, uh...
someplace I need to be.

38:06.071 --> 38:07.772
You're going after Gertrude.

38:11.242 --> 38:12.293
I was going to ask you.

38:12.344 --> 38:13.811
Dad, you don't have to ask.

38:13.845 --> 38:16.080
You deserve to be happy.

38:16.114 --> 38:18.349
Go.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.151
Run to her.
Run to her.

38:20.185 --> 38:22.286
I'm a Casey; I don't run.

38:22.320 --> 38:25.289
I stalk my prey.

38:32.864 --> 38:36.701
Oh, my precious Clara.

38:36.735 --> 38:38.936
You are going
to love Chicago.

38:38.954 --> 38:42.456
And Mimi is gonna come
and see you all the time.

38:45.977 --> 38:48.312
I don't know how I'm supposed
to leave you like this.

38:50.549 --> 38:52.883
Ellie, you have to.

38:52.918 --> 38:56.353
You've taken care
of me for far too long.

38:56.388 --> 38:59.140
You have Clara and Devon.

38:59.174 --> 39:00.491
I'm fine.

39:00.525 --> 39:02.860
I'm all grown up now.

39:02.894 --> 39:06.180
My little brother.

39:06.231 --> 39:08.482
Aces, Charles.

39:08.517 --> 39:10.534
You're aces.

39:12.154 --> 39:14.338
What about Sarah, Chuck?

39:17.209 --> 39:18.342
I don't know.

39:20.846 --> 39:22.346
Morgan, she could
be anywhere.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.415
Okay, you know
where she is.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.350
You told me to
listen to our hearts,

39:26.384 --> 39:28.536
because our brains
only screw us up.

39:28.587 --> 39:29.754
I was in love then.

39:29.788 --> 39:31.388
You're still in love.

39:31.423 --> 39:35.059
I want you to imagine
something for me, okay?

39:35.093 --> 39:36.594
Where is she right now?

39:36.628 --> 39:37.928
Don't think.

39:37.963 --> 39:39.513
Use your heart.

39:39.548 --> 39:41.549
Where is she?

40:03.955 --> 40:07.074
I was hoping you'd be here.

40:09.077 --> 40:12.797
This place is
important, isn't it?

40:12.831 --> 40:14.865
Yeah, yeah, very much.

40:17.269 --> 40:20.905
This is actually where you
told me I was going to be okay.

40:20.939 --> 40:23.407
That I could trust you.

40:23.441 --> 40:25.709
And that's exactly
what I'm doing now.

40:25.744 --> 40:28.562
I'm asking you to trust me.

40:28.597 --> 40:31.882
Sarah, I don't... I don't
want anything from you.

40:31.917 --> 40:36.153
I-I just need you to know
that wherever you go,

40:36.188 --> 40:40.191
I'll always be
there to help you.

40:41.459 --> 40:44.361
Someone you can call.

40:44.396 --> 40:45.396
Whenever.

40:49.868 --> 40:52.369
Trust me, Sarah.

40:52.404 --> 40:55.406
I'm here for you always.

41:05.817 --> 41:08.953
Chuck?

41:08.987 --> 41:11.922
Tell me our story.

41:15.493 --> 41:18.329
Yeah, yeah, uh...

41:18.363 --> 41:19.496
Where to begin?

41:19.531 --> 41:21.832
Well, uh, it started

41:21.867 --> 41:24.168
with a guy who worked
at Buy More.

41:24.202 --> 41:28.489
And then, one day, an old
college friend of his

41:28.540 --> 41:31.642
sent him an e-mail that
was filled with secrets.

41:31.676 --> 41:34.245
And then, the next day,

41:34.279 --> 41:36.313
his life really changed

41:36.348 --> 41:39.984
when he met a spy named Sarah,

41:40.018 --> 41:42.553
and he fell in love.
