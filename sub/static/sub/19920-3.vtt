00:00.052 --> 00:02.687
- <i>Previously on "Shots Fired"...</i>
- You speak to Javier's lawyer?

00:02.796 --> 00:05.406
<i>He's seeking to
characterize you as an unfit mother.</i>

00:05.500 --> 00:08.414
<i>Unless you show the court
you're working to fix these issues,</i>

00:08.492 --> 00:09.701
<i>you're going to lose your child.</i>

00:09.726 --> 00:11.082
<i>Officer Beck to headquarters.</i>

00:11.107 --> 00:12.739
I need some units. Shots fired!

00:12.807 --> 00:14.374
As you reflect
on the life of Jesse Carr,

00:14.441 --> 00:16.075
will you become a better person?

00:16.143 --> 00:18.278
<i>Joey Campbell
was murdered three weeks ago.</i>

00:18.345 --> 00:21.581
<i>So I pose this question to our
governor: what about Joey?</i>

00:21.649 --> 00:23.373
- Y'all talk to Pastor Janae?
- Why?

00:23.467 --> 00:25.502
Few weeks ago, she found out
Joey was hustling.

00:25.569 --> 00:28.037
- Had him tuned up.
- She had them put hands on him?

00:28.105 --> 00:30.874
Cops ain't the only ones round
here people scared of.

00:30.941 --> 00:32.509
<i>I think Beck's a good
cop in a bad department.</i>

00:32.576 --> 00:34.511
<i>You think Beck shot Jesse over race.</i>

00:34.578 --> 00:37.438
- We need to work both cases.
- Jesse's case and Joey's.

00:37.532 --> 00:39.849
No more going behind each other's backs.

00:39.917 --> 00:41.184
We have to trust each other.

00:41.252 --> 00:42.585
You heard there was some witnesses.

00:42.653 --> 00:44.921
- Have any come forward?
- A lady named Kiana.

00:44.989 --> 00:47.190
<i>Told some people she was there
when they took my boy.</i>

00:47.258 --> 00:49.333
No one's got answers for you
because you keep asking

00:49.404 --> 00:51.427
- the wrong questions.
- So what's the right question?

00:51.495 --> 00:52.796
Talk to us, we can protect you.

00:53.646 --> 00:57.220
- You hear anything about Joey?
- No, not Joey, but another boy, Cory.

00:57.298 --> 00:59.025
- <i>No one's seen him.
- How long's he been gone?</i>

00:59.111 --> 01:00.904
<i>Ever since he talked to you.</i>

01:27.536 --> 01:30.628
Hey, come on, man!

01:32.503 --> 01:34.612
- Cory have any priors?
- None.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.557
- What about his parents?
- His dad was in jail

01:36.582 --> 01:38.549
for a couple of days
for a parking ticket.

01:44.793 --> 01:45.755
Who is it?

01:45.780 --> 01:48.618
Department of Justice.
We just need a minute of your time.

01:48.686 --> 01:50.186
<i>I ain't got a minute.</i>

01:50.254 --> 01:51.588
It's about Cory Grant.

01:51.655 --> 01:53.556
<i>- What?
- Cory Grant!</i>

01:53.624 --> 01:56.025
This will work better
if you just open the door.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.147
What do y'all want with my son?

02:05.264 --> 02:06.903
We think he might have
information concerning

02:06.971 --> 02:08.371
Joey Campbell's murder.

02:08.439 --> 02:09.906
No, he don't.

02:09.973 --> 02:11.975
He doing okay?

02:12.042 --> 02:13.204
I hear he's missing.

02:13.345 --> 02:16.246
- I haven't seen him in a couple of days.
- A couple of days?

02:16.313 --> 02:19.816
Usually he goes to my sister's
house when we get into it,

02:19.884 --> 02:21.985
she haven't seen him, nobody seen him.

02:22.052 --> 02:23.720
You haven't filed
a missing persons report?

02:23.787 --> 02:26.589
Mr. Grant, the first 48 hours are critical.

02:27.390 --> 02:28.424
Okay.

02:35.566 --> 02:37.367
<i>All units report...</i>

02:37.434 --> 02:39.369
Get your ass back here!

02:40.905 --> 02:43.206
Now, Deputy!

02:43.274 --> 02:45.375
<i>All available units please respond.</i>

02:45.736 --> 02:48.509
Don't go running into a situation
you know nothing about!

02:48.588 --> 02:49.879
<i>All units, shots fired.</i>

02:51.615 --> 02:53.950
<i>All available units please respond.</i>

02:57.655 --> 02:58.721
Ready?

02:59.898 --> 03:00.945
Move.

03:03.627 --> 03:05.528
- Got left!
- Yeah.

03:09.434 --> 03:10.538
Here!

03:11.157 --> 03:13.313
I got you.

03:18.809 --> 03:21.275
Deceased.

03:24.175 --> 03:26.369
Headquarters, shot crime scene...

03:26.884 --> 03:29.185
What you got?

03:29.253 --> 03:32.873
African-American male. 17, 18 years old.

03:35.759 --> 03:37.593
Are you gonna be all right?

03:38.762 --> 03:40.330
I'm fine.

03:44.001 --> 03:46.035
You're a long ways off
the Jesse Carr scene.

03:46.103 --> 03:47.737
We were passing through,
heard the shots.

03:48.124 --> 03:50.521
See it all the time in here.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.344
Rival dealers getting into
a beef over a corner.

03:54.411 --> 03:56.879
This kid's an athlete.
How many dealers you know hydrate?

03:56.947 --> 03:58.281
You'd be surprised.

03:58.349 --> 04:01.451
Whatever he was, he was somebody's son.

04:01.518 --> 04:04.654
Who was most likely killed
by another black guy.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.991
Now, where are all your cameras
and your protesters now?

04:38.155 --> 04:41.611
You know, I've been to funerals
with open caskets before.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.513
Saw Jesse Carr in his. But...

04:45.429 --> 04:47.397
I've never seen a brother just
laid out like that.

04:49.466 --> 04:51.367
How do you get used to it?

04:56.440 --> 04:58.541
There's something about the eyes
when a person dies.

05:01.078 --> 05:04.210
One moment they have life...

05:06.454 --> 05:08.320
and then something changes.

05:11.722 --> 05:14.513
Don't know how to describe it,
but you never get used to it.

05:24.686 --> 05:26.554
How's Deputy Beck?

05:26.904 --> 05:29.027
He's fine, Donnie.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.786
I retire, they fill my slot
with one of them.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.714
- You're drunk, man.
- Is that why you look so pretty?

05:39.883 --> 05:41.217
Hey.

05:43.932 --> 05:46.693
I'm making a petition.

05:47.779 --> 05:49.780
Beck has gotta go.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.595
It was a clean shoot.

05:52.663 --> 05:53.663
I'm not that drunk.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.565
Here.

05:55.632 --> 05:56.942
Sign.

06:00.817 --> 06:02.004
Here, come on.

06:03.929 --> 06:06.005
You, too.

06:07.711 --> 06:09.512
Get the hell out of my face.

06:14.184 --> 06:16.886
Tell this deputy who I am.

06:16.954 --> 06:19.355
Brooks, this is Donnie. He did 30 years.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.991
Eight years as captain.

06:22.961 --> 06:25.740
But now he's just a sorry-ass drunk.

06:32.236 --> 06:34.036
You know how scared you used to be

06:34.104 --> 06:36.072
working the neighborhood, Calvert?

06:36.831 --> 06:39.575
How you almost pissed your pants

06:39.909 --> 06:41.542
first day on patrol? Huh?

06:42.709 --> 06:44.147
You know what, you're a disgrace.

06:44.214 --> 06:46.149
You...

06:46.239 --> 06:47.706
your deputy...

06:49.219 --> 06:51.521
...and your black cop boyfriend.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.507
Okay, can we...

07:05.669 --> 07:08.004
Can you, can you put your...

07:08.188 --> 07:10.123
Come on, baby, will you help Mama out?

07:13.043 --> 07:14.811
Mind your head.

07:15.154 --> 07:16.654
You're in?

07:16.847 --> 07:18.214
The shoes.

07:22.219 --> 07:24.683
Christian, that is not the shirt
I laid out for you.

07:24.784 --> 07:26.656
- Get back in there and change.
- But Mom!

07:26.723 --> 07:28.814
Hurry up, please! You're gonna be late.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.026
Put your shoes on, Daddy's ready.

07:30.093 --> 07:32.464
Come on, hustle, hustle, hustle.

07:32.729 --> 07:34.253
Kerry, can you drive the boys
to school today?

07:34.278 --> 07:36.032
I want to clear my head.

07:39.136 --> 07:40.589
- Yeah. Honey...
- Thanks.

07:40.614 --> 07:42.305
One question, Deputy Beck, please!

07:42.372 --> 07:45.208
Have you given any more thought
to sitting with the psychologist?

07:45.275 --> 07:48.077
Kerry, my union rep bailed on me.

07:48.145 --> 07:51.347
Psych gonna help me with that?

07:53.445 --> 07:55.202
Do you have a comment
on the cell phone video?

07:57.351 --> 07:58.818
Right here!

07:58.855 --> 08:00.423
We just want to hear
your side of the story, Deputy.

08:00.490 --> 08:02.525
<i>Your daughter's been asking for you.</i>

08:02.593 --> 08:05.095
<i>Mr. Cano is granting permission
for a scheduled call.</i>

08:05.181 --> 08:08.474
I shouldn't even have to ask
for permission.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.818
<i>Ashe, this is a good thing.</i>

08:11.868 --> 08:13.502
What time's the call?

08:13.570 --> 08:15.833
<i>Tomorrow. After school. 2:00 p.m.</i>

08:16.506 --> 08:18.107
Everything all right?

08:18.175 --> 08:20.476
All good.

08:21.739 --> 08:25.383
I offered Deputy Beck spiritual
counseling, and he declined.

08:25.453 --> 08:26.849
That's all I know about him.

08:26.917 --> 08:28.818
Oh, and that he's the only black face

08:28.885 --> 08:30.054
in the sheriff's department.

08:30.117 --> 08:32.321
Ever witness Deputy Beck
be aggressive with anyone?

08:32.389 --> 08:34.642
The deputies in our community
are always aggressive.

08:34.667 --> 08:35.825
That isn't their problem.

08:35.892 --> 08:38.830
Their problem is that they don't
know how to be effective.

08:38.855 --> 08:40.602
That why you started
your own street patrol?

08:40.626 --> 08:41.731
"The Hands"?

08:41.798 --> 08:43.399
To be more effective?

08:43.467 --> 08:45.244
What's that short for, the Hands of God?

08:45.330 --> 08:47.346
If we could police ourselves,
we wouldn't need anybody

08:47.416 --> 08:50.252
from the outside coming in here
with their quick trigger fingers.

08:50.346 --> 08:53.342
That include scaring
Joey Campbell straight?

08:54.150 --> 08:56.078
Heard he sold weed.

08:57.052 --> 08:59.755
Figured The Hands may have
had an issue with that.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.285
What does this have to do
with Deputy Beck or Jesse Carr?

09:02.352 --> 09:04.654
Aren't you also seeking
justice for Joey Campbell?

09:07.924 --> 09:09.762
We heard a young man
by the name of Cory Grant

09:09.819 --> 09:11.453
may have seen something.

09:12.605 --> 09:14.463
First I heard about it.

09:16.233 --> 09:19.451
Figured you knew everything
popping off in The Houses.

09:20.365 --> 09:21.971
What did Cory tell you?

09:22.039 --> 09:24.507
Nothing, he's been missing
for the last couple of days.

09:26.910 --> 09:29.965
Any idea where we should
start looking for him?

09:30.180 --> 09:32.996
No, but I'll ask around.

09:59.811 --> 10:02.710
Hello, Ms. Carr, my name's Penn Moder.

10:02.804 --> 10:05.061
I know who you are...
you're running for governor.

10:05.944 --> 10:08.175
First, I just want to offer
my condolences.

10:08.806 --> 10:10.548
What happened to your son
was a hate crime.

10:10.678 --> 10:13.046
He did not deserve to die
at the hands of a racist cop.

10:13.604 --> 10:16.182
You didn't even know my son.

10:16.299 --> 10:18.163
I know a promising
young life was cut short.

10:18.188 --> 10:19.470
And I know that we need to make sure

10:19.495 --> 10:22.102
it never happens to anyone
else's son, ever again.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.725
You can know all those things,

10:25.750 --> 10:27.928
but it still doesn't bring my son back.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.364
No, but we can make his death
mean something more.

10:30.431 --> 10:32.432
I'm proposing the
"Jesse Carr Call First" bill.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.535
Whenever anyone under 21 is
pulled over in Oakdale County,

10:35.603 --> 10:37.906
the deputy has to call
the child's parents first

10:37.931 --> 10:39.617
before he can ask them
to exit the vehicle.

10:39.642 --> 10:42.383
This protects the youth,
it protects the parents,

10:42.484 --> 10:44.289
and the deputy.

10:44.645 --> 10:48.500
You want to use my son's death
as a political platform.

10:49.305 --> 10:52.085
No, I want to honor his memory.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.389
His memory's not for sale.

10:55.456 --> 10:57.891
Governor Eamons called
the D.O.J. in for a reason.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.889
They're not investigating
that cop to get to the truth.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.195
They're investigating
that cop to create a new one.

11:02.263 --> 11:04.222
And they're not going to stop

11:04.386 --> 11:06.433
until they have gutted every good memory

11:06.457 --> 11:08.335
- that you have of your son.
- You need to leave.

11:10.805 --> 11:12.005
I'll keep you in my prayers.

11:21.707 --> 11:24.418
We are outside the house of Alicia Carr,

11:24.485 --> 11:26.217
mother of slain victim Jesse Carr.

11:26.305 --> 11:30.257
Penn Moder has just visited
the Carr household at this time...

11:33.961 --> 11:36.229
Toxicology report for Jesse Carr.

11:36.297 --> 11:38.031
No traces of marijuana in his system.

11:38.099 --> 11:39.692
Weed was found in the glove compartment.

11:39.717 --> 11:41.535
Maybe Jesse planned to party later on.

11:41.602 --> 11:43.236
Or maybe his mother was right about him

11:43.304 --> 11:44.638
and he didn't do drugs.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.606
Before you give him a halo...

11:49.025 --> 11:51.244
Blood alcohol level of .08.

11:51.556 --> 11:53.455
He was legally drunk.

11:55.116 --> 11:57.039
Are you close to making an arrest?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.752
Well, the investigation
is still ongoing,

11:58.820 --> 12:01.321
but we just need
to clarify a few things.

12:01.389 --> 12:04.424
How long had Jesse been
struggling with alcohol?

12:05.726 --> 12:06.860
He wasn't.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.831
That is Jesse, correct?

12:11.308 --> 12:13.443
He did spend a month
in a rehab facility?

12:13.636 --> 12:15.980
Oh, God, that was...

12:17.246 --> 12:20.807
No, his-his teacher caught him
and some friends with alcohol

12:20.832 --> 12:22.807
after a football game.

12:22.832 --> 12:25.882
I just wanted to stop it
before it got out of hand.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.000
By rehab over just one incident?

12:28.054 --> 12:29.723
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

12:29.937 --> 12:31.725
Been sober for six months now.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.332
In Alicia's typical fashion,
she overreacted.

12:34.417 --> 12:37.348
You don't get to say that.
You weren't there.

12:37.854 --> 12:40.800
Not for 15 years.
You shouldn't be here now.

12:40.868 --> 12:42.068
He called me.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.170
- What?
- Six weeks ago.

12:44.238 --> 12:46.632
He said he was having problems
adjusting to college life.

12:46.718 --> 12:47.974
He wanted advice.

12:49.405 --> 12:50.945
So what did you say?

12:51.145 --> 12:53.112
I told him to be himself.

12:53.414 --> 12:55.248
He said he wasn't sure if he knew how.

12:56.551 --> 12:58.893
He told me everything was fine.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.587
He didn't want you to worry.

13:01.112 --> 13:03.659
Jesse died with alcohol in his system.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.860
He was driving drunk?

13:07.369 --> 13:08.911
Possibly.

13:09.051 --> 13:11.317
Was he pulled over for drunk driving?

13:11.411 --> 13:14.294
- No, he wasn't.
- Then what is this?

13:14.419 --> 13:17.067
You're just trying to dig up
any dirt you can on my son?

13:17.137 --> 13:19.306
Only two people know
what happened that day:

13:19.490 --> 13:21.545
your son and Deputy Beck.

13:21.787 --> 13:23.977
We're being thorough in
our investigation of both.

13:24.514 --> 13:27.213
My son can't speak for himself.

13:27.647 --> 13:28.959
He was murdered.

13:31.152 --> 13:33.151
But all you care about
is protecting your own.

13:39.789 --> 13:41.489
Jesse's car.

13:42.126 --> 13:44.965
It was his high school
graduation present.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.801
They told me it's in impound.

13:48.477 --> 13:49.603
When can I have it?

13:51.205 --> 13:53.172
I'll look into it.

14:00.413 --> 14:02.342
When word got out to the white community

14:02.413 --> 14:04.522
about how good my father's cooking was,

14:04.608 --> 14:07.006
white people started sneaking in
the back door for take-out.

14:08.663 --> 14:11.230
Some say integration
in Gate Station didn't begin

14:11.292 --> 14:12.550
with the civil rights movement.

14:12.698 --> 14:14.561
It began with white people
wanting our cobbler.

14:16.097 --> 14:17.864
I bet he's got a lot of stories.

14:17.932 --> 14:19.599
Very few of them are true.

14:21.952 --> 14:24.270
I appreciate you coming down, Governor.

14:24.338 --> 14:27.073
Showing your support in
The Gate will go a long way.

14:27.141 --> 14:30.382
Contrary to what you imply,
I have always had an affinity

14:30.467 --> 14:32.993
for the people of this community.

14:33.681 --> 14:36.126
I called you out because
I knew you'd listen.

14:36.617 --> 14:37.798
When you ran in your first term,

14:37.875 --> 14:40.232
you said you would be governor
of all the people.

14:40.488 --> 14:43.289
- The wealthy and the middle class.
- And I meant it.

14:43.357 --> 14:45.258
Not the lower class?

14:46.599 --> 14:49.668
You are aware I have decreased
state taxes for the poor

14:49.746 --> 14:51.898
and I am fighting to raise
the minimum wage.

14:51.966 --> 14:54.167
I appreciate that, but we need more.

14:57.204 --> 14:58.405
What else do you appreciate?

15:00.183 --> 15:02.540
- I'm not Reverend DuPont.
- Noted.

15:02.565 --> 15:05.170
But we could have met
in a more private place.

15:05.246 --> 15:06.746
What do you really want?

15:06.814 --> 15:08.348
To serve.

15:09.854 --> 15:11.184
What else?

15:11.479 --> 15:14.587
I want you, Governor Eamons,
to serve as well.

15:33.485 --> 15:35.887
Alicia Carr is here.

15:41.430 --> 15:42.549
Ms. Carr.

15:42.616 --> 15:44.217
Can I help you?

15:44.285 --> 15:45.819
I'm in.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.057
Okay.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.467
FOX 46 obtained exclusive video
of the moments

15:59.548 --> 16:01.733
right after shots were fired.

16:01.819 --> 16:02.944
We do want to warn you, though,

16:02.969 --> 16:05.647
these images you're about to see
are pretty graphic.

16:05.872 --> 16:08.940
They show a young man's life
over after an apparent drug stop

16:08.965 --> 16:10.316
went horribly wrong.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.201
It happened when a Gate Station
sheriff's deputy pulled over

16:13.226 --> 16:14.964
19-year-old Jesse Carr.

16:15.032 --> 16:17.357
Officials say there
was some sort of altercation,

16:17.428 --> 16:19.135
and then the shots were fired.

16:19.203 --> 16:23.807
Carr, an NC State freshman and
Gate Station native was unarmed.

16:30.138 --> 16:31.514
Ms. Carr?

16:34.819 --> 16:37.787
- What's all this?
- Is there something you needed?

16:39.690 --> 16:42.397
Your son's car.

16:42.593 --> 16:44.994
They need you to sign
these release forms.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.529
You know what, I want
to put the chair over there.

16:52.069 --> 16:54.504
Interesting new friends.

16:57.775 --> 17:01.384
I believed you when you first said
you're here to police the police.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.064
I don't believe you anymore.

17:08.551 --> 17:10.252
Excuse me.

17:15.419 --> 17:17.153
- Take your time.
- Yeah.

17:17.178 --> 17:20.012
Quiet, please, quiet on the set.

17:21.678 --> 17:23.482
Rollin'.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.156
Speed.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.248
So, um... where do I look?

17:30.316 --> 17:32.684
Oh, I'm sorry, yes, right in the camera.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.152
Just take your time,
whenever you're ready, okay?

17:39.392 --> 17:42.358
My son, Jesse, was my best friend.

17:43.369 --> 17:46.771
He was murdered by someone
trained and paid by tax dollars

17:46.796 --> 17:48.772
to protect him.

17:48.897 --> 17:50.936
My life has been shattered.

17:51.003 --> 17:55.006
I know it's not a dream,
but I wake up every day wishing it was.

17:55.721 --> 17:58.343
Penn Moder is introducing a bill

17:58.411 --> 17:59.911
that would require police officers

17:59.979 --> 18:02.369
to call the parents of anyone under 21

18:02.440 --> 18:03.548
pulled over from Oakdale.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.618
When a police officer breaks the law,

18:06.766 --> 18:08.286
they should be held accountable.

18:08.618 --> 18:10.989
Someone should be held accountable.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.560
I'll stand behind anyone
willing to speak up for us,

18:16.165 --> 18:17.944
for mothers...

18:18.423 --> 18:20.562
All mothers.

18:20.898 --> 18:23.268
Penn Moder is that person.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.109
Thanks for all you do, Governor.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.617
- Good afternoon, Governor Eamons.
- Good afternoon, Pastor.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.038
The mother's name is Shameeka Campbell.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.109
Younger son, Shawn, is 13?

18:43.194 --> 18:44.314
You've done your homework.

18:54.242 --> 18:56.388
Shameeka Campbell, Governor Eamons.

18:56.490 --> 18:58.861
It's truly a pleasure
to meet you, Ms. Campbell.

18:58.940 --> 19:00.861
You have my sincere condolences.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.197
Thank you, Governor.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.635
- This is my aide, Sarah Ellis.
- Hi.

19:05.161 --> 19:07.195
Please, y'all come on in.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.617
Have a seat.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.786
Thank you, what a nice home.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.655
Oh, it ain't much.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.923
It's impressive.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.925
Tells me a lot about you.

19:24.298 --> 19:26.399
This is Shawn. My youngest.

19:28.516 --> 19:30.101
Thank you for coming
to visit us, Governor.

19:30.188 --> 19:32.063
Thank you for having us.

19:32.157 --> 19:34.172
Would you like
some sweet tea or lemonade?

19:34.240 --> 19:36.429
- Tea, please.
- Okay.

19:36.527 --> 19:38.528
The same, thank you.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.754
Oh, I was, uh, I was at work

19:42.824 --> 19:44.783
and Joey was dribbling
a ball in the house.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.585
I come home

19:46.652 --> 19:48.520
and find the tile
taped together like that.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.060
I got so mad.

19:50.310 --> 19:54.357
Even at 17, he looked like he
could cry when I yelled at him.

19:55.243 --> 19:57.373
Always my baby.

19:57.998 --> 20:02.591
Now I just... I want it
to stay like that, you know?

20:04.396 --> 20:08.607
Well, you could give my daughter
some organizational pointers.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.008
Moms is no joke.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.461
She runs a tight ship.

20:11.531 --> 20:13.645
Think the Hornets
will break through this year?

20:13.713 --> 20:16.156
That was my brother's.
Actually, most of this was his.

20:16.242 --> 20:18.414
I shared a room growing up
with my sister.

20:18.439 --> 20:20.218
I was also the youngest.

20:20.406 --> 20:22.914
She hogged all the wall space, too.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.556
So you like being governor?

20:25.426 --> 20:26.911
Most of the time.

20:26.986 --> 20:29.253
What's the best part about your job?

20:29.595 --> 20:30.862
Helping people.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.164
Maybe you can help the Hornets, then.

20:36.907 --> 20:40.631
We really want to thank you both
for your hospitality

20:41.140 --> 20:43.092
and I'll make sure the sheriff's
office is doing

20:43.170 --> 20:45.410
everything they can
to get your son justice.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.678
You have my word.

20:48.425 --> 20:50.360
Do you have any pull with GSS?

20:50.716 --> 20:53.218
- The school board?
- Yes, ma'am.

20:53.409 --> 20:55.553
Um, they're shutting down
Shawn's school,

20:55.621 --> 20:58.229
West Gate Middle School, saying
he got to go to the nearest one,

20:58.300 --> 20:59.979
which is 15 times worse.

21:00.181 --> 21:02.248
Now he a straight-A student,
he got a chance.

21:02.355 --> 21:04.167
The minute he go to the
other school, I just...

21:04.917 --> 21:07.432
You know, I don't know
what kind of future he'll have.

21:07.651 --> 21:10.299
I'm not sure what I can do
if the school is closing.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.706
But I will look into it.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.043
If you ever need anything at all,

21:18.110 --> 21:20.313
please don't hesitate to call me.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.448
- It was nice meeting you, Shawn.
- Goodbye, Governor Eamons.

21:24.274 --> 21:25.817
Great handshake.

21:29.481 --> 21:31.690
Jesse and I broke up
about two months ago.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.240
- What happened?
- Just didn't work out.

21:34.568 --> 21:36.728
- You broke up with him?
- Why does that matter?

21:36.796 --> 21:37.818
Everything matters.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.631
I don't want you thinking
he was a bad guy,

21:39.699 --> 21:40.758
'cause he wasn't.

21:40.914 --> 21:43.531
When we first met, he was shy,
one of the few guys

21:43.596 --> 21:46.062
into the Daniel Clowes
<i>Ghost World</i> graphic.

21:46.789 --> 21:49.125
Then he pledged that frat
and things just changed.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.542
Did he drink when you were with him?

21:50.609 --> 21:52.177
No, he wasn't into drinking.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.845
Wasn't into smoking.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.047
That thing at the dorm was
out of character for him.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.627
What thing?

21:58.174 --> 22:00.041
He got into it with his R.A.

22:00.205 --> 22:02.674
I wasn't there, but hearing
people talk...

22:03.222 --> 22:05.385
It wasn't the guy I fell in love with.

22:07.533 --> 22:09.501
He got drunk, like, one time.

22:09.718 --> 22:11.118
Makes him a saint around here.

22:11.237 --> 22:12.965
So why are folks still talking about it?

22:13.034 --> 22:15.567
- Look, I got class.
- I'll walk with you.

22:15.803 --> 22:17.637
Am I under arrest or something?

22:17.778 --> 22:19.304
I'm just looking for a conversation.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.972
I'm not a snitch.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.869
If I had a dime for every time
somebody said that

22:22.894 --> 22:24.995
before snitching,
I'd be a billionaire... now talk.

22:25.198 --> 22:27.366
What the hell happened
the night he got drunk?

22:30.248 --> 22:32.497
He came into the dorm
with a couple of frat buddies.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.119
White boy wasted.

22:34.677 --> 22:36.302
Acting stupid.

22:36.466 --> 22:39.427
So I told Jesse he had to bounce.

22:39.643 --> 22:41.292
Got in my face and wouldn't chill, so...

22:41.360 --> 22:42.627
So?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.529
So I had to beat his ass.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.131
In front of his frat buddies?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.999
In front of everybody.

22:56.910 --> 22:59.331
Let's just say Jesse's your
typical kid today. Right?

22:59.364 --> 23:01.765
Doesn't see color, or at least,
that's what he thinks.

23:01.833 --> 23:04.702
Until his frat buddies start giving
him hell for embarrassing them.

23:04.769 --> 23:06.403
See, he figured it was about manhood,

23:06.471 --> 23:08.372
but they make it clear it's about race.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.183
So now, suddenly, that's in him
when he's pulled over by Beck.

23:11.277 --> 23:13.464
- Along with a couple of drinks.
- Drinking doesn't change you.

23:13.534 --> 23:15.245
It amplifies who you really are.

23:15.313 --> 23:17.247
And there's no evidence
that Jesse was racist.

23:17.315 --> 23:19.550
It's not like he called the R.A.
the N-word.

23:19.617 --> 23:21.085
Is that how you categorize a racist?

23:21.852 --> 23:24.054
Look, I know how these frat boys think.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.626
Yeah.

23:30.596 --> 23:33.263
Okay, text me the address.

23:34.065 --> 23:36.487
Friend of mine just tracked
Kiana's cell phone.

23:36.565 --> 23:39.403
Looks like our other witness
isn't missing after all.

23:40.470 --> 23:42.908
- Tracked down how?
- Don't worry about it.

23:42.979 --> 23:45.338
I will if it's a Fourth
Amendment violation.

23:45.426 --> 23:47.294
Am I missing something?

23:47.490 --> 23:49.854
I just found our other witness
in the Joey Campbell murder.

23:50.155 --> 23:52.916
She's pinging in Concord.
Wealthy suburb.

23:52.984 --> 23:55.486
- Long way from The Houses.
- We need authorization for that.

23:55.553 --> 23:58.689
You wanted to find Cory,
I'm finding him.

23:58.986 --> 24:02.220
Getting info isn't always
gonna be fresh and clean.

24:03.290 --> 24:05.562
This whole partner thing,
it's new to me.

24:05.630 --> 24:07.297
Well, catch up and get used to it.

24:09.685 --> 24:11.720
Okay, I'll let you do your thing.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.203
I'll handle Jesse's frat tomorrow.

24:13.271 --> 24:16.874
Yeah, channel your inner Yale frat boy.

24:16.984 --> 24:19.119
You know, I'm a Sigma.

24:21.846 --> 24:23.080
You're serious?

24:23.148 --> 24:24.281
Yeah.

24:25.885 --> 24:27.920
You know who else is Sigma Zeta?

24:28.153 --> 24:31.455
Two presidents, four treasurers,
one Supreme Court justice,

24:31.480 --> 24:33.065
and about 50 D.O.J. prosecutors.

25:00.437 --> 25:02.586
♪ I don't know when I lost control ♪

25:07.069 --> 25:09.437
♪ I don't know when I fell in love ♪

25:14.133 --> 25:16.258
- Kiana Ward?
- Yeah, can I help you?

25:16.352 --> 25:18.535
I'm an investigator with
the Department of Justice.

25:19.594 --> 25:21.436
- I got nothing for you.
- How do you know?

25:21.461 --> 25:22.606
I haven't asked you anything.

25:22.674 --> 25:25.375
- Still got nothing.
- Want me to stay here all night?

25:25.443 --> 25:27.318
I can sing, too. Just not good.

25:27.388 --> 25:29.480
Trust me, your nice new neighbors
ain't gonna like that.

25:40.316 --> 25:42.910
- Damn, you came up real good, sis.
- What do you want?

25:42.935 --> 25:44.928
Joey Campbell's murderer.
You were there that night.

25:44.996 --> 25:46.338
- Who says?
- His mother.

25:46.432 --> 25:47.664
And by the looks of things,

25:47.732 --> 25:50.100
she's not the only one who
thinks you got something to say.

25:50.168 --> 25:52.336
No disrespect to her,
but she got her facts twisted.

25:52.403 --> 25:54.805
There was another witness,
a kid named Cory.

25:54.864 --> 25:57.332
- He's gone missing.
- What do you mean missing?

25:57.408 --> 25:58.976
<i>Nobody's seen him for the last two days.</i>

25:59.050 --> 26:01.354
<i>- Know anything about it?
- No.</i>

26:01.513 --> 26:03.280
<i>Gotta be careful, Kiana.</i>

26:03.768 --> 26:05.776
<i>Same thing could happen to you
if you don't tell me</i>

26:05.861 --> 26:07.448
<i>what the hell is going on.</i>

26:08.831 --> 26:10.554
If Kiana's being paid to keep quiet

26:10.622 --> 26:12.890
about Joey Campbell's murder,
maybe Cory is, too.

26:12.963 --> 26:15.168
Cory's dad didn't exactly
look like he was rolling in it.

26:15.239 --> 26:17.261
So is he missing
or does he not want to be found?

26:17.328 --> 26:19.162
<i>Either way, we'll find him.</i>

26:22.200 --> 26:23.433
Yeah.

26:24.726 --> 26:26.617
<i>So you hanging with your
frat brothers yet?</i>

26:26.642 --> 26:28.939
All I need to know from them
is if Jesse had the propensity

26:29.007 --> 26:30.707
to reach for a cop's gun.

26:30.775 --> 26:32.109
<i>A black cop's gun.</i>

26:32.176 --> 26:33.210
<i>Look, I gotta go.</i>

26:39.150 --> 26:40.884
Kai?

26:40.952 --> 26:42.452
<i>Ashe, it's me.</i>

26:42.627 --> 26:44.221
<i>The call's been delayed.</i>

26:44.665 --> 26:46.086
Delayed?

26:46.525 --> 26:49.426
What kind of baby daddy crap
is he pulling?

26:49.494 --> 26:51.395
<i>He says he forgot she had
something after school.</i>

26:51.462 --> 26:52.984
What time is the call now?

26:53.009 --> 26:55.666
<i>They gave a window... sometime
in the next two to three hours.</i>

26:55.733 --> 26:58.484
- He knows I'm in the middle of a case.
<i>- Ashe.</i>

26:58.570 --> 27:01.008
<i>Do you want to speak
to your daughter or not?</i>

27:01.306 --> 27:02.969
Yes.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.211
Yes...

27:06.773 --> 27:07.840
Okay, fine.

27:07.979 --> 27:09.605
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

27:12.737 --> 27:14.451
<i>Look, it really wasn't this big thing.</i>

27:14.519 --> 27:16.119
You know, the kid,
he got his ass kicked.

27:16.187 --> 27:17.754
We had a good laugh, that was it.

27:17.822 --> 27:20.257
So why'd he drive to Gate Station?

27:20.325 --> 27:22.793
We had this social going on
with our little sisters.

27:23.169 --> 27:24.761
And you sent him to get the weed.

27:25.474 --> 27:27.264
- Weed?
- No.

27:27.332 --> 27:29.032
The house voted for barbecue, and Jesse,

27:29.100 --> 27:30.801
he volunteered to go get it.

27:30.868 --> 27:32.569
He went all the way to
Gate Station for barbecue?

27:32.637 --> 27:34.679
He said it was his favorite spot.

27:34.910 --> 27:36.711
We didn't know it'd be
the last time we saw him.

27:38.515 --> 27:39.610
Thanks.

27:43.252 --> 27:44.819
Yo, G!

27:56.561 --> 27:57.761
Miss Campbell?

27:58.475 --> 27:59.997
How are you?

28:00.064 --> 28:01.765
Lieutenant Breeland.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.001
Yes? What is this about?

28:04.676 --> 28:07.504
The governor has asked
that we leave no stone unturned

28:07.572 --> 28:09.434
in your son's case.

28:09.650 --> 28:13.145
So if there's anything else
you might want to share...

28:14.409 --> 28:16.677
No, sir, there's nothing.

28:17.589 --> 28:19.282
You don't have to be scared of me.

28:19.350 --> 28:20.717
- I ain't scared of you.
- Well, good.

28:28.960 --> 28:32.396
I didn't mean to come off
so harsh when we first met.

28:32.665 --> 28:34.531
Some people will smile in your face,

28:34.599 --> 28:37.085
but they don't give a damn
what goes on here.

28:37.829 --> 28:39.647
It's a war.

28:40.371 --> 28:43.772
I ain't no Boy Scout,
but I'm on the right side of it.

28:44.308 --> 28:46.243
So if you hear of any other witnesses,

28:46.310 --> 28:48.597
or any info at all,

28:49.386 --> 28:50.792
I want to be your first call.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.445
How long before you're initiated?

29:31.827 --> 29:32.980
Couple weeks.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.407
Hang in there, it's worth it.

29:35.466 --> 29:37.810
- You're frat?
- Mm-hmm.

29:38.442 --> 29:41.978
Yeah, those letters just don't
disappear when you graduate.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.340
I'm Sigma.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.463
You're about to be Sigma.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.174
- You know, we're almost like...
- ...brothers.

29:49.768 --> 29:52.249
So what kinds of things
they have you doing?

29:53.551 --> 29:54.484
You gonna use it against me?

29:54.552 --> 29:56.486
I'm not a cop.

29:56.554 --> 29:58.021
But you ask a lot of questions.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.723
I'm just a lawyer.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.528
The other night,
I had to drive blindfolded.

30:04.914 --> 30:07.531
This morning I had to eat
a vomit omelet.

30:07.664 --> 30:10.380
Man, just wait till the
vodka push-up challenge.

30:10.466 --> 30:12.068
Oh, my God, serious?

30:13.893 --> 30:15.627
It's gonna suck.

30:17.138 --> 30:18.708
They make Jesse do crazy stuff, too?

30:20.315 --> 30:22.201
Not at first.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.687
Because he didn't really seem into it.

30:24.849 --> 30:26.917
It's, like, the more
they think we want this,

30:26.984 --> 30:29.452
the harder they are on us, you know?

30:29.763 --> 30:31.997
After he got beat,
they started to target him.

30:32.114 --> 30:33.991
Why?

30:34.158 --> 30:35.358
Because Ted was pissed.

30:35.426 --> 30:37.961
He said he embarrassed the whole frat,
made us look like bitches.

30:39.739 --> 30:41.239
That's why they sent him to the hood.

30:43.017 --> 30:45.259
Wait, so getting barbecue
in the hood was...

30:45.536 --> 30:46.736
punishment for getting his ass kicked?

30:47.149 --> 30:49.272
Not just getting his ass kicked, man.

30:49.725 --> 30:52.209
For getting his ass kicked
by a black guy.

30:55.012 --> 30:56.146
Yeah.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.266
♪ <i>All my bitches keep it trill, trill</i> ♪

31:08.352 --> 31:10.193

31:25.837 --> 31:27.577
What the hell's up?!

32:01.243 --> 32:02.879
Babe, what are you doing down there?

32:03.158 --> 32:06.349
The sink started leaking again.

32:08.019 --> 32:09.887
Thought the plumber fixed it.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.144
You call him?

32:13.683 --> 32:15.392
He said he couldn't get out this way.

32:15.459 --> 32:17.556
Did you tell him it's
the same problem as before?

32:17.724 --> 32:20.165
It didn't seem to matter.

32:23.884 --> 32:26.169
Bet you if you told him we were
the Mills across the street,

32:26.237 --> 32:28.171
he would have came running,
but instead he hears

32:28.241 --> 32:30.206
that it's the black cop
that shot the white kid,

32:30.274 --> 32:31.875
so now all of a sudden
his ass can't show up

32:31.942 --> 32:33.243
to fix the one thing
that he messed up...

32:34.178 --> 32:35.612
What?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.447
- Damn it!
- Oh, babe.

32:37.515 --> 32:40.457
- I'm fine.
- It's not fine.

32:40.519 --> 32:41.551
Look at that cut.

32:41.618 --> 32:43.543
Kerry!

32:43.621 --> 32:45.042
I said I'm fine.

32:52.467 --> 32:54.036
We got to stop doing this.

32:54.104 --> 32:55.738
Doing what?

32:58.803 --> 33:01.520
Everyone is looking at us sideways.

33:02.073 --> 33:03.640
We can't start doing that to each other.

33:03.708 --> 33:05.508
Looking at <i>us</i> sideways?

33:08.879 --> 33:10.680
What happened?

33:11.035 --> 33:13.735
I was over at Anna's apartment today,

33:14.063 --> 33:16.553
supposedly to help her pick out
colors for the dresses,

33:16.620 --> 33:20.071
and she graciously offered
to let me bow out

33:20.149 --> 33:23.727
of being a bridesmaid since
we're "under so much pressure."

33:27.465 --> 33:29.532
- Caleb's going to be pissed.
- Don't say anything.

33:30.305 --> 33:31.868
If she doesn't want me in the wedding,

33:31.936 --> 33:34.168
she's gonna have to be
straight up with it.

33:34.405 --> 33:37.207
I don't understand. I-I don't.

33:37.691 --> 33:39.668
We worked so hard.

33:39.807 --> 33:41.675
Done everything right.

33:41.762 --> 33:43.513
We're supposed to be building on that,

33:43.581 --> 33:46.298
not getting tore down
in front of the whole world.

33:48.454 --> 33:51.020
I swear, that stupid video's
gonna cost me my entire life.

33:53.634 --> 33:55.692
How do we get through this, Kerry?

33:55.760 --> 33:56.726
Baby...

34:00.231 --> 34:03.500
It is you and me right now.

34:05.202 --> 34:06.951
Let the world bring it.

34:08.038 --> 34:09.639
We can get through anything together.

34:11.308 --> 34:13.076
I promise you.

34:20.369 --> 34:22.283
Good afternoon,
Gates Station sheriff's office.

34:22.308 --> 34:24.049
How can I help you?

34:25.572 --> 34:26.706
Where do I turn this in?

34:27.049 --> 34:29.743
Impound's two blocks from here.

34:32.676 --> 34:35.415
Don't worry yourself, Deputy,
I'll find it.

34:35.483 --> 34:36.917
What was he wearing?

34:36.985 --> 34:38.252
A gray hoodie and camo pants.

34:38.319 --> 34:39.386
How long's he been missing?

34:39.454 --> 34:41.473
Three days now.

34:48.362 --> 34:50.597
We'll put out a "be on the lookout."

34:50.665 --> 34:51.893
See if we can't find your son.

35:18.796 --> 35:20.445
Yo!

35:21.311 --> 35:22.920
I got it.

36:16.343 --> 36:18.218
Hey, Boogs!

36:18.396 --> 36:20.092
<i>Mama, guess what?</i>

36:20.185 --> 36:23.256
Excuse me! I have not
talked to you in five days.

36:23.324 --> 36:26.152
<i>Hi, Mama, I miss you!</i>

36:26.389 --> 36:28.089
I miss you, too, Boogs.

36:28.192 --> 36:29.563
More than you know.

36:29.630 --> 36:31.238
<i>Mama! Guess what?</i>

36:31.348 --> 36:32.738
Okay, what?

36:32.856 --> 36:35.702
<i>Paula took me shopping
at the mall today to get shoes</i>

36:35.770 --> 36:37.737
<i>and there was a big crowd
of people in front</i>

36:37.823 --> 36:39.003
<i>of this one store.</i>

36:39.081 --> 36:40.815
<i>So we go over there and guess what?</i>

36:40.895 --> 36:42.729
<i>We saw Serena!</i>

36:43.457 --> 36:46.046
- That's so good, Boogs.
<i>- Muy buena.</i>

36:46.114 --> 36:47.848
Actually, it's pronounced <i>muy bueno.</i>

36:48.707 --> 36:50.050
<i>Muy buena.</i>

36:50.118 --> 36:52.038
<i>I think Paula would know.</i>

36:52.195 --> 36:55.722
Fine, then from now on
you speak English with me, okay?

36:55.790 --> 36:59.026
And when we have a call
scheduled, you call me, okay?

36:59.093 --> 37:01.406
You don't blow it off
to go shoe shopping!

37:02.797 --> 37:04.687
<i>Sorry, Mama.</i>

37:05.047 --> 37:07.086
Kai, are you crying?

37:07.235 --> 37:08.636
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

37:09.153 --> 37:11.370
Why are you crying, Kai?

37:12.105 --> 37:14.105
<i>Ashe, what the hell did you say to her?</i>

37:14.234 --> 37:16.206
Javier, put Kai back on the phone.

37:16.230 --> 37:17.690
<i>She's crying, Ashe.</i>

37:17.691 --> 37:20.264
- <i>I'm not putting her back on the phone.
- Put Kai back on the damn phone!</i>

37:20.289 --> 37:21.982
<i>I knew we shouldn't have done this.</i>

37:26.551 --> 37:27.988
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

37:28.036 --> 37:29.942
<i>to an automated voice messaging system.</i>

37:35.484 --> 37:37.164
Impressive.

37:37.719 --> 37:39.461
You think?

37:44.039 --> 37:46.818
Yeah, you're right.

37:47.803 --> 37:50.584
Well, that's why you
brought me here, isn't it?

37:50.734 --> 37:51.968
To impress me?

37:54.037 --> 37:57.201
It's just a place I come
to clear my head.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.779
Something going on
with the investigation?

38:03.333 --> 38:04.833
Actually, yeah.

38:05.959 --> 38:08.779
I think I may have put
a young kid's life at risk.

38:09.197 --> 38:11.420
What are you going to do?

38:12.539 --> 38:14.981
Ashe says we'll find him, so...

38:15.457 --> 38:17.466
I have to trust her.

38:18.021 --> 38:20.286
That doesn't come easy to you.

38:20.754 --> 38:22.354
Trusting people.

38:25.874 --> 38:27.408
It's your turn.

38:27.543 --> 38:29.516
Impress me.

38:29.584 --> 38:30.698
I can't hit a lick.

38:30.749 --> 38:33.167
Come on, doesn't have to be with a bat.

38:39.541 --> 38:41.166
Freshman year at Duke,

38:41.682 --> 38:45.098
I found out this fraternity
had a notebook called "The Slut Guide"

38:45.166 --> 38:46.733
filled with the names of sorority girls

38:46.801 --> 38:49.230
and what they did sexually.

38:49.316 --> 38:52.038
So I organized a SlutWalk on campus,

38:52.106 --> 38:54.925
and with 300 women,
we shut the frat down.

38:55.292 --> 38:58.496
Governor Eamons heard about it
and offered me an internship.

38:59.514 --> 39:01.254
Were you in it?

39:01.549 --> 39:03.150
Where?

39:03.217 --> 39:04.168
The notebook.

39:05.019 --> 39:06.297
Really?

39:06.399 --> 39:09.313
That's what you have to say about it?

39:10.673 --> 39:13.524
Look, I'm impressed.

39:19.915 --> 39:22.046
So, do you trust her?

39:22.421 --> 39:23.821
Hm?
