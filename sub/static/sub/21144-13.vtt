00:01.836 --> 00:02.601
- Hey, guys. I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.052
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

00:04.088 --> 00:07.205
Have you ever had a dream
so real and so scary,

00:07.240 --> 00:10.258
you're like, "Am I dreaming?
Am I awake?"

00:10.293 --> 00:12.363
I usually have these dreams where my teeth
are falling out, but they're not my teeth.

00:12.387 --> 00:15.272
They're mini versions of me,
but their teeth are falling out.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.966
- I would see someone about that.
- Don't you think I've tried?

00:20.754 --> 00:23.096
Here's our latest video,
"The Night Dream."

00:32.491 --> 00:35.859

And I... I missed it.

02:58.445 --> 03:01.113
All right, Amelia, there is
no way you're walking out

03:01.148 --> 03:02.859
of Halloween movie night
without being scared.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.276
Puh-lease! Nothin' scares me.

03:06.312 --> 03:08.152
I grew up on a farm
in the middle of the woods.

03:09.782 --> 03:13.032
I've seen things.

03:13.068 --> 03:17.462
I grew up in the suburbs
of Tarzana.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.998
I've seen nothing.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.967
My scary movie pick
is<i> Mutant Killer Clowns 5</i>

03:23.002 --> 03:25.044
Wow, that sounds super scary.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.813
What's scarier
is how underdeveloped

03:26.848 --> 03:29.082
its female characters are.

03:29.118 --> 03:31.926
It really shines a light on how
women have a long way to go

03:31.962 --> 03:33.162
in the fight for equal rights.

03:35.274 --> 03:39.000
Oh, right. You and Paige
had lunch yesterday.

03:39.036 --> 03:41.102
Let's just
get movie night started.

03:41.138 --> 03:44.030
Allow me to set up
the projection system.

03:44.065 --> 03:45.465
I'm kinda the tech whiz
around here.

03:47.510 --> 03:48.885
(power clunks, whines)

03:48.921 --> 03:52.196
- (sighs)
- Others: Bernie!

03:52.232 --> 03:54.015
Well, what did you think
would happen?

03:56.344 --> 03:58.503
All right, looks like
I'm not gettin' scared tonight.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.249
Hey, wait! Just 'cause the
power went out doesn't mean

04:00.273 --> 04:03.108
we can't scare you
with scary stories.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.977
Have you heard
the terrifying tale of...

04:06.012 --> 04:07.404
<i>Doll-o-ween?</i>

04:07.439 --> 04:10.248
(bones rattling)

04:10.283 --> 04:12.525
(knife whizzes, tings)

04:12.561 --> 04:15.937
Paige: <i>It was Bizaardvark's
fourth anniversary,</i>

04:15.973 --> 04:19.591
<i>and Bernie Schotz wanted to buy
his friends a thoughtful gift.</i>

04:19.627 --> 04:22.227
Hey, what happened to the day-old
donut shop that used to be here?

04:23.547 --> 04:24.547
Oh my gosh!

04:27.343 --> 04:29.951
You're hot.

04:29.986 --> 04:31.305
How'd you like
to go out sometime?

04:31.329 --> 04:34.739
Don't make me use the broom!

04:34.774 --> 04:37.892
Yeah, a lot of ladies get
swept up by these good looks.

04:41.289 --> 04:44.574
Welcome to Witch Amelia's
Dark Arts Emporium.

04:44.610 --> 04:48.928
What are you searching for?
Lotions, potions, curses, purses?

04:48.963 --> 04:52.048
We also sell things
that don't rhyme.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.436
I'm looking for a gift
for my friends.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.460
They look like this.

04:56.020 --> 04:58.504
You're in luck.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.499
We have two dolls that look
exactly like your friends.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.672
Ten dollars! Madame, you
are a witch, and a crook!

05:10.126 --> 05:11.810
Hey, what about those
equally-as-cute dolls

05:11.845 --> 05:13.219
that say 99 percent off?

05:15.206 --> 05:16.714
Uh, I wouldn't buy those.

05:16.750 --> 05:21.169
They're what we in the business
call... "very haunted."

05:21.205 --> 05:23.313
(thunder crashes)

05:27.561 --> 05:29.580
Sorry, I was waiting for that
evil, ominous lightning to pass.

05:29.604 --> 05:30.887
I'll take 'em!

05:30.923 --> 05:32.030
(thunder crashes)

05:32.991 --> 05:36.001
Paige: <i>That night, Paige and
Frankie unwrapped the dolls</i>

05:36.036 --> 05:38.128
<i>and played with them for hours.</i>

05:38.163 --> 05:39.323
I'm bored. Let's go to sleep.

05:46.004 --> 05:47.921
(ominous music playing)

05:57.491 --> 06:00.032
(loud clattering)

06:00.068 --> 06:02.769
- What was that?
- I don't know.

06:02.804 --> 06:06.106
Maybe I could've seen it if I
wasn't sleeping on the floor!

06:08.051 --> 06:09.901
Look! The dolls are gone!

06:20.864 --> 06:22.288
(dolls giggle)

06:29.139 --> 06:30.672
- (dolls giggle)
- (both shriek)

06:32.851 --> 06:34.092
Frankie, I'm scared.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.887
- (screaming)
- (scare-sting music playing)

06:46.923 --> 06:48.990
Sorry. Really gotta
change my ringtone.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.066
(scare-sting tone stops)

06:52.579 --> 06:55.255
- What do you want, Bernie?
- Bernie (over phone):<i> Hey, hey!</i>

06:55.290 --> 06:57.735
<i>Forgot to mention the super hot
witch I'm dating told me the dolls</i>

06:57.759 --> 07:00.485
<i>might be very haunted and will
probably try to hurt you.</i>

07:00.521 --> 07:02.401
<i>Just wanted to let you know.
Well, good night!</i>

07:04.157 --> 07:05.840
Aah!

07:05.875 --> 07:08.768
- Attack!
- Destroy!

07:08.804 --> 07:11.713
- Aw. They talk.
- Paige, run!

07:11.748 --> 07:12.964
(dolls growl)

07:17.871 --> 07:21.189
Dirk! There are two dolls with knives
on the loose that look like us!

07:21.224 --> 07:22.907
Yeah, I know. They're killing.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.810
What? Who?

07:24.845 --> 07:28.162
No, comedically!

07:28.198 --> 07:30.690
Have you seen
their latest music video?

07:30.725 --> 07:33.784
Both: ♪<i> Knives and rope,</i>
<i>knives and rope</i> ♪

07:33.820 --> 07:35.820
<i>♪ And that's what's funny
'bout knives and rope ♪</i>

07:36.615 --> 07:39.783
I mean, you gotta watch
the whole video for context,

07:39.818 --> 07:43.077
but it really sums up the uses of
knives and rope in a very funny way.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.109
♪ Somethin' with farts,
somethin' with farts... ♪

07:50.144 --> 07:51.828
Eh, I'll figure out
the rest later.

07:51.863 --> 07:54.672
- Huh.
- No way!

07:54.708 --> 07:56.491
We didn't know
you were comedians.

07:56.526 --> 07:58.109
We thought you were
trying to kill us.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.128
No, we don't wanna kill you.

08:01.164 --> 08:02.844
(demonic voice)
We wanna kill your channel!

08:04.417 --> 08:07.035
Kill our channel?

08:07.070 --> 08:11.656
Yep, we already put up 200 videos
and have eight million subscribers.

08:11.733 --> 08:15.334
(demonic voice) Your days
are done, Bizaardvark.

08:15.370 --> 08:19.698
Aw. They have
a tiny little camera.

08:19.733 --> 08:20.733
Paige!

08:22.610 --> 08:25.470
And stay out of your house!
It's ours now!

08:25.505 --> 08:29.715
(cackling)

08:29.751 --> 08:32.268
Paige: <i>Paige and Frankie
knew there was only one way</i>

08:32.304 --> 08:34.587
<i>to save Bizaardvark:
Destroy the dolls.</i>

08:38.301 --> 08:41.962
Hey! Let's promise each other
that, no matter how big we get,

08:41.997 --> 08:44.814
we never forget
where we came from.

08:44.849 --> 08:48.876
Both (demonic voices):
The bowels of the underworld!

08:48.912 --> 08:50.687
(loud clattering)

08:50.722 --> 08:51.722
Huh?

08:52.907 --> 08:54.440
(panting)

08:56.520 --> 08:57.800
- Ha-ha-ha!
- (scare sting plays)

08:59.505 --> 09:01.130
- (scare sting plays)
- (dolls whimper)

09:01.166 --> 09:02.448
- (scare sting plays)
- Aah!

09:02.484 --> 09:03.383
- (scare sting plays)
- (shrieks)

09:03.418 --> 09:04.800
(scare sting plays)

09:04.836 --> 09:06.236
Dude, enough
with the sound effects!

09:07.931 --> 09:10.073
- Aah! No!
- No!

09:10.108 --> 09:12.458
- No!
- Aah! No!

09:12.493 --> 09:14.202
What are you gonna do?
Rip off my limbs?

09:14.237 --> 09:16.896
Throw me in the fireplace?

09:16.931 --> 09:21.151
No, I'm gonna torture you with the one
thing I know real Frankie can't handle.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.468
- Feelings!
- (gasps)

09:24.714 --> 09:26.683
So how do you feel about school?
Are you fitting in?

09:26.707 --> 09:29.117
Stop it!

09:29.152 --> 09:32.294
How do you feel about your teen years?
Lots of emotions?

09:32.330 --> 09:35.598
You're a monster!

09:35.634 --> 09:38.167
I just want you to know
that no matter what,

09:38.202 --> 09:39.878
I love you.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.047
(whimpers)

09:43.082 --> 09:44.841
(screams)

09:44.876 --> 09:45.876
(explodes)

09:48.104 --> 09:51.164
Aw. It even explodes cute.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.295
What are you gonna do with me?

09:55.319 --> 09:59.372
Take me out using some deep
understanding of Paige's personality?

09:59.407 --> 10:02.800
Yeah. I know she hates
meat grinders.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.235
Doll: No! No, no, no!

10:04.270 --> 10:06.679
(whirring)

10:10.168 --> 10:12.910
I mean, you're not wrong.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.705
Frankie: <i>Defeating the dolls
made the girls hungry,</i>

10:15.741 --> 10:17.899
<i>so they celebrated
by making doll burgers.</i>

10:20.611 --> 10:23.112
(scare-sting playing)

10:24.482 --> 10:27.567
What, Bernie?

10:27.602 --> 10:28.662
Bernie (over phone): <i>Hey, I
know this'll never come up,</i>

10:28.686 --> 10:33.147
<i>but don't eat the dolls!</i>

10:33.183 --> 10:35.236
<i>It's one of the haunted rules,
something about transforming</i>

10:35.260 --> 10:37.101
<i>into something horrible
for the rest of time.</i>

10:37.136 --> 10:38.169
<i>Toodles!</i>

10:40.940 --> 10:43.883
(music box playing off-key)

10:49.799 --> 10:50.799
(flames whoosh)

10:55.004 --> 10:57.881
That doll story
wasn't very scary.

10:57.916 --> 11:01.567
Although, I did really like
the "Knives and Rope" song.

11:03.513 --> 11:04.765
Do you think those dolls
are funnier than us?

11:04.789 --> 11:08.116
Paige, we made that story up
and came up with all the jokes.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.980
Good news! We're all safe!

11:14.015 --> 11:16.791
I caught this dragon
wandering around outside!

11:18.436 --> 11:21.329
Viking Guy, it's Halloween.

11:21.364 --> 11:22.644
That's a kid
in a dragon costume.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.386
It's your lucky day, dragon.

11:31.474 --> 11:34.083
Sorry, ma'am, he doesn't get...

11:34.119 --> 11:35.119
things.

11:37.414 --> 11:39.605
I hate Halloween!

11:39.640 --> 11:41.574
People walking around
in silly costumes,

11:41.609 --> 11:43.601
pretending to be something
they're not!

11:43.636 --> 11:45.486
What a bunch
of delusional idiots!

11:48.975 --> 11:51.993
So... we're telling
scary stories.

11:53.404 --> 11:55.647
Ooh-hoo! I'm in!

11:55.682 --> 11:58.341
Don't get your hopes up.
Nothing's scared me yet.

11:58.376 --> 12:00.568
Oh, yeah? Well, then get ready

12:00.603 --> 12:03.162
for this gruesome tale
of horror:<i> Dirkula.</i>

12:03.197 --> 12:05.906
(growls)

12:05.942 --> 12:07.133
(bats screeching)

12:08.778 --> 12:11.387
- (door bells chime)
- Whoa.

12:12.824 --> 12:14.399
What is this place?

12:14.434 --> 12:15.892
It's my go-to dark arts store.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.478
Let me do the talking.
The owner loves me.

12:21.499 --> 12:23.041
Hey, hey!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.710
Ugh. What do you want?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.928
We usually flirt like this
for a couple minutes,

12:27.964 --> 12:29.739
then talk business.

12:29.774 --> 12:32.250
So, your hat looks
pointier than last time.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.493
(electrical crackling)

12:35.180 --> 12:36.412
Well, that's new.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.784
I've been dared to spend Halloween
night alone in my studio,

12:41.819 --> 12:43.495
but I don't have a bed
to sleep on.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.471
Why don't you
just not do the dare?

12:45.507 --> 12:46.714
(both laugh)

12:49.519 --> 12:50.968
That's not how my life works.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.690
Well, our bedding section is

12:55.725 --> 12:57.759
the one department
that isn't haunted.

12:57.794 --> 12:59.594
We have hammocks, futons...

12:59.629 --> 13:01.437
That coffin bed
says 99 percent off.

13:04.725 --> 13:07.760
Again, you're really
not gonna want that.

13:07.795 --> 13:09.795
I'm pretty sure it's cursed,

13:09.831 --> 13:11.706
because the last owner
was a vampire.

13:11.741 --> 13:13.165
(ominous music plays)

13:13.200 --> 13:15.418
"Pretty sure," you say?

13:15.453 --> 13:17.895
(ominous music plays)

13:17.931 --> 13:20.200
All right, Dareheads, I'm ready
to spend the whole night alone

13:20.224 --> 13:21.833
in my studio,
in my sweet new bed!

13:25.205 --> 13:26.788
(bat squeaks)

13:26.823 --> 13:28.756
Aw. A Halloween butterfly!

13:44.040 --> 13:46.440
(coffin creaking)

13:51.689 --> 13:53.740
Dare completed.

13:53.775 --> 13:55.699
Man, I'm hungry.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.851
I could go
for some blood sausage.

13:57.887 --> 13:59.454
Or a blood orange.

13:59.489 --> 14:01.338
Or blood blood!

14:01.374 --> 14:03.299
Or a panini.

14:03.334 --> 14:04.584
With a side of blood!

14:08.648 --> 14:09.722
What up, everybody?

14:09.758 --> 14:10.758
(screaming)

14:13.160 --> 14:14.636
Dirk?

14:14.671 --> 14:17.496
Are you okay?

14:17.531 --> 14:19.090
What did you do last night?

14:19.125 --> 14:20.758
The usu... checked some e-mails,

14:20.793 --> 14:22.952
slept in a cursed coffin,

14:22.988 --> 14:25.871
dreamt I was battling
an army of mutant wolves,

14:25.906 --> 14:28.026
then I woke up, ate two entire
rats, and now I'm here.

14:29.919 --> 14:33.988
Yes, that does sound
like the usu.

14:34.023 --> 14:37.892
No! I think he might've
transformed into a vampire.

14:37.927 --> 14:39.151
What are you talking about?

14:39.186 --> 14:40.494
(hisses)

14:42.824 --> 14:44.248
Yeah, take a look in the mirror.

14:48.729 --> 14:50.680
I guess I look
a little invisible.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.195
But we all have
those mornings, right?

14:53.551 --> 14:56.302
Dirk, old friend. Come here.

14:57.947 --> 14:59.530
Tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle!

14:59.566 --> 15:01.432
(in deep voice)
Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

15:03.144 --> 15:07.237
Whoa. Maybe I am a vampire.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.665
Whatever's happening here, let's
not blame it on the coffin,

15:09.700 --> 15:12.643
that was a great deal.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.212
I just hope this doesn't
change anything between us.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.807
Definitely not.
We're friends for life.

15:17.842 --> 15:19.536
Wanna have lunch with us?
We're eatin' pizza.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.193
- Yum!
- And garlic knots!

15:21.228 --> 15:22.662
(hisses)

15:24.240 --> 15:25.415
- Hmm.
- What?

15:25.450 --> 15:28.951
Guys, bad news.

15:28.986 --> 15:32.304
I think Dirk's a vampire.

15:32.340 --> 15:34.718
Dirk: <i>It was clear being a vampire
was going to keep Dirkula</i>

15:34.742 --> 15:36.659
<i>away from his friends.</i>

15:36.694 --> 15:39.570
Hey, guys! The sun's out!

15:39.606 --> 15:42.106
Let's go enjoy it
'cause we're humans and we can!

15:42.141 --> 15:45.226
- Yeah! All right!
- Ha-ha-ha!

15:45.261 --> 15:48.020
Dirk: <i>Afraid he'd lose
his friends forever,</i>

15:48.055 --> 15:50.715
<i>Dirkula came up with a plan
to turn them all into vampires.</i>

15:50.750 --> 15:53.025
Thanks for invitin' us
to a party.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.528
Sure. Can I offer you
a warm neck wipe?

15:57.532 --> 15:59.548
A neck wipe?

15:59.584 --> 16:02.342
It's a perfectly normal thing
to have at a party.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.795
Hey, let's do
some neck stretches, yeah?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.038
To the right!

16:08.150 --> 16:10.117
Everybody try it.

16:10.153 --> 16:12.587
I'll turn off the lights
so you can't see me.

16:12.622 --> 16:14.664
Uh, Dirk, stop.

16:14.699 --> 16:16.019
It's obvious
what's going on here.

16:17.785 --> 16:21.162
You want me to DJ.

16:21.197 --> 16:24.590
No! He wants to bite us
in the neck

16:24.625 --> 16:27.944
and turn us into vampires.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.901
Well, that's a relief.
I forgot my DJ equipment.

16:31.883 --> 16:34.434
Dude! I can't believe
you tried to trick us,

16:34.469 --> 16:36.235
with a party,
and free food and...

16:36.271 --> 16:37.528
Ooh, is this funnel cake?

16:39.048 --> 16:40.281
Not cool.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.525
Sorry, guys.

16:43.561 --> 16:47.229
I thought if we were all
vampires, we could hang again.

16:47.264 --> 16:49.732
Maybe I came on too strong.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.702
Why don't you watch
this presentation instead?

16:52.737 --> 16:54.095
(cheery background
music playing)

16:54.130 --> 16:56.163
<i>So, you're thinking
about entering</i>

16:56.198 --> 16:58.799
<i>the fast-paced world of the undead.
Good choice.</i>

16:58.834 --> 17:00.301
<i>Being a vampire means
no curfew...</i>

17:00.336 --> 17:02.979
Ooh!

17:03.014 --> 17:04.191
<i>Capes in any color you want...</i>

17:04.215 --> 17:07.107
Ooh!

17:07.143 --> 17:09.255
<i>And teeth sharp enough to
pierce the skin of a moose.</i>

17:09.279 --> 17:11.020
I have always wanted
to bite a moose.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.241
<i>So, if you like exciting night,</i>

17:15.276 --> 17:17.868
<i>living forever, and basketball-</i>

17:17.903 --> 17:21.080
<i>Yep, we're good at that, too...</i>

17:21.157 --> 17:23.966
<i>Then why not give
the vampire lifestyle a try?</i>

17:24.002 --> 17:25.762
Announcer: <i>Nights may or may nt
be exciting.</i>

17:27.972 --> 17:30.430
Dirk, I think I speak
for everyone when I say,

17:30.466 --> 17:33.075
being a vampire sounds awesome!

17:33.110 --> 17:34.377
- (chuckles)
- We're in!

17:34.412 --> 17:36.637
Really? Sweet!

17:36.672 --> 17:38.806
(ominous music playing)

17:38.841 --> 17:41.025
(cheery music playing)

17:41.061 --> 17:43.319
Hi, there. I'm Page
Olvera from Bizaardvark.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.129
And I'm Frankie Wong.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.190
I know we're having
a lot of fun,

17:47.266 --> 17:49.608
but there is a serious issue
we need to discuss:

17:49.643 --> 17:51.543
Vampire peer pressure.

17:51.578 --> 17:55.364
It's a thing, and it's real.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.667
It can be tempting to think,
"I'll live forever.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.360
Hey! I can fly now."

18:00.396 --> 18:03.872
We get it, that stuff is cool.

18:03.907 --> 18:05.708
But it's okay to say no.

18:05.743 --> 18:07.243
Or more realistically...

18:07.278 --> 18:09.178
(screaming) No!

18:09.213 --> 18:14.166
So, the next time you find
yourself in a haunted castle,

18:14.201 --> 18:16.502
just remember,
vampires could be anywhere.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.939
They could even be
your best friend.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.256
Wait. What?

18:21.292 --> 18:23.784
- (growls)
- (screams)

18:23.819 --> 18:25.227
Paige:<i> We'll be right bat!</i>

18:25.262 --> 18:26.262
(standby tone drones)

18:30.918 --> 18:33.002
All right, I have heard
two of your stories,

18:33.037 --> 18:36.088
and I haven't been
scared one bit.

18:36.123 --> 18:37.626
Well, that's 'cause
you haven't heard my story.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.375
The terrifying tale of...

18:39.410 --> 18:40.609
I'm bored.

18:45.983 --> 18:48.375
The terrifying tale of...

18:48.411 --> 18:49.918
<i>Bernwolf!</i>

18:49.953 --> 18:51.287
(eerie music playing)

18:51.322 --> 18:54.373
(wolf howling)

18:56.302 --> 18:58.302
Hey, hey!

18:58.337 --> 19:01.656
Did someone order
their favorite customer?

19:01.691 --> 19:04.300
Don't make me push the security
buzzer under the counter.

19:05.786 --> 19:07.720
Man, will we or won't we?

19:09.873 --> 19:13.617
So, I've been looking for something
to help me stand out more in school,

19:13.652 --> 19:16.372
- maybe like a cologne or a body spray...
- Let me save you the time.

19:17.965 --> 19:21.784
Cursed Cologne.
It's 99 percent off.

19:21.819 --> 19:24.278
Just take it
and never come back!

19:28.635 --> 19:30.117
So I'll call you.

19:31.654 --> 19:32.654
Aah! Fireball!

19:35.366 --> 19:39.426
Bernie: <i>The next day, Bernie decided
to test out his new cologne.</i>

19:39.462 --> 19:41.603
(body thuds)

19:41.639 --> 19:43.923
Bernie (grunting):
Finally! Puberty!

19:45.585 --> 19:47.610
It's about time!

19:47.645 --> 19:50.179
(grunting, groaning)

19:54.652 --> 19:56.227
(growling)

20:01.225 --> 20:04.610
I am Bernwolf!

20:04.645 --> 20:06.737
(howling weakly)

20:08.866 --> 20:10.999
Wait. Doesn't it need
to be a full moon

20:11.034 --> 20:12.718
to turn into a werewolf?

20:12.754 --> 20:14.895
Yeah. There was
a full moon outside.

20:14.931 --> 20:16.205
During the daytime?

20:18.884 --> 20:21.385
Yes. It was Moon Day.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.420
Trust me, it's a thing.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.218
Finally, people will notice me,

20:29.253 --> 20:31.529
and I'll be the most
popular kid in school!

20:31.564 --> 20:34.515
(lively chattering)

20:34.550 --> 20:35.683
(camera clicks)

20:38.596 --> 20:40.538
(weakly) Ah-ooo!

20:40.573 --> 20:43.357
(cheering)

20:44.760 --> 20:46.610
The end.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.615
How was that a scary story?

20:54.011 --> 20:55.861
There was a howl at the end.

20:55.896 --> 20:57.204
Did... Did you not hear
the howl?

20:59.550 --> 21:02.451
Oh, I thought that
was a mouse dying.

21:02.486 --> 21:04.628
Or like...
like a tiny door closing?

21:06.690 --> 21:09.542
Yeah, I was waiting
for something to happen...

21:09.577 --> 21:12.052
but then nothing happened.

21:12.088 --> 21:15.764
That's because
you haven't heard...

21:15.800 --> 21:19.417
the ending
where something happens!

21:19.453 --> 21:22.988
<i>So Bernwolf was there in school
when in walked his arch nemesi.</i>

21:23.023 --> 21:24.849
Stop right there, Bernwolf.

21:24.884 --> 21:28.151
Bank Robber,
what are you doing here?

21:28.187 --> 21:31.008
And I know the answer is not that I can't
come up with my own original characters,

21:31.032 --> 21:33.315
and I have to steal from
what's right in front of me.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.951
Whoa! Stuff is happening!

21:38.247 --> 21:40.513
This school isn't big enough
for two bank robbers.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.709
But you're not a bank robber.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.710
Oh, right.

21:46.497 --> 21:48.489
Let me guess.

21:48.524 --> 21:51.249
He spins around and has a
mask and a bag of money.

21:51.285 --> 21:53.418
Ooh, I was gonna say "The end."
That's good.

21:53.453 --> 21:55.529
(groans)

21:55.565 --> 21:59.891
Now we're both bank robbers!
Let's fight.

21:59.927 --> 22:03.112
- I don't really wanna...
- Bernie:<i> The bank robber totally wanted to fight.</i>

22:03.147 --> 22:05.122
<i>First, they engaged in kung fu.</i>

22:05.157 --> 22:07.825
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!

22:07.860 --> 22:10.869
Bernie:
<i>Then, old-timey boxing stuff.</i>

22:10.904 --> 22:14.139
- Yeah, come on, put 'em up.
- You think you can do this to me? I'm a big guy.

22:14.174 --> 22:16.183
Bernie:
<i>Then, they did the Robot.</i>

22:16.218 --> 22:19.737
- Seriously?
<i>- They did... the Robot!</i>

22:19.772 --> 22:21.797
(electronic music playing)

22:21.832 --> 22:24.075
<i>Then, Bernwolf won.</i>

22:24.110 --> 22:26.001
- Do I lay down now?
- Yes, please.

22:28.038 --> 22:30.163
(fanfare plays)

22:30.198 --> 22:32.466
Victory!

22:32.501 --> 22:36.236
(weakly) Ah-ooo!

22:36.272 --> 22:39.315
And that's how Bernie
saved Arbor Day.

22:39.350 --> 22:40.794
Bernie, we're telling
Halloween stories.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.277
Oh, shoot.

22:43.312 --> 22:45.570
Uh... Well, don't worry.

22:45.606 --> 22:47.659
I have a super Halloween ending,
with a witch and everything.

22:47.683 --> 22:51.126
Hi, Bernwolf.

22:51.162 --> 22:54.221
That was impressive and manly.

22:54.256 --> 22:56.216
Let's get married and tell
this story to our kids!

23:00.713 --> 23:01.787
(screams)

23:05.459 --> 23:08.293
Now that's the scariest story
I've ever heard in my life.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.931
(scary music plays)
