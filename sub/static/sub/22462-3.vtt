MARK: <i>Hmm.</i>

00:21.760 --> 00:25.246
<i>Once upon a time, I might have woken
to the sound of a song thrush.</i>

00:25.271 --> 00:29.095
<i>Now it's a couple of guys pounding
the living daylights out of each other.</i>

00:29.120 --> 00:30.554
<i>I mean, it's fine.</i>

00:30.600 --> 00:33.831
<i>It's just...When Jeremy had sex
with women, I hated the noise,</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:35.871
<i>but at least there was</i> something <i>in it
for me.</i>

00:35.920 --> 00:39.197
<i>Now it's like there are two Jeremy's
in there humping each other.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:41.470
<i>- That would be his dream.
-</i> JEZ: Fuck!

00:42.920 --> 00:45.480
So, just to be clear, for my records,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.752
you're sleeping with Joe regularly now.

00:47.777 --> 00:50.432
- Can't handle it.
- I can handle it, I'm fine with it.

00:50.457 --> 00:52.754
Just, what, you've gone gay?

00:52.800 --> 00:55.137
- Your word, not mine.
- Sure, but...

00:55.162 --> 00:56.991
let's say you had a Wikipedia page,

00:57.040 --> 01:00.158
which obviously you don't, regardless of
how many times you try and put one up.

01:00.183 --> 01:04.306
Would it say that Jeremy Usborne
was gay or straight?

01:04.331 --> 01:06.190
I don't fit in to your tiny little boxes.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.753
I'm just looking for that sacred
connection, and for that,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.599
I'd fuck any single member
of the human race.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.432
Yes. Yes, I believe that. You know I've always
been a bit gay. I've always liked a bit of that.

01:15.457 --> 01:16.793
Like with Pej in Darty.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.989
You and Pej?

01:18.040 --> 01:20.202
We used to get pissed
and pull each other off. Didn't you?

01:20.227 --> 01:21.417
You should've. It was great.

01:21.442 --> 01:23.391
I have a long and varied list of regrets,

01:23.440 --> 01:27.070
Jeremy, but not being pulled off by Pej
isn't one of them.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.793
The thing about sex with a guy,

01:28.840 --> 01:31.514
it's like getting your car fixed
at the actual dealership.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.063
They've got all the codes.
You just plug right in.

01:34.088 --> 01:35.732
I mean, you like blowjobs,
don't you, Mark?

01:35.757 --> 01:37.432
I'm eating a Fruit Corner, Jeremy.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.879
Of course you do. But...

01:38.920 --> 01:41.673
what's the most blowjobs
you've ever had in one day?

01:41.720 --> 01:44.030
Like in the first happy days
of a relationship?

01:44.080 --> 01:46.117
- One.
- Right.

01:46.160 --> 01:50.358
Well, my life now
is a 24/7 blow-job bonanza.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.869
I very much regret
starting this conversation.

01:52.920 --> 01:53.910
Put it this way.

01:53.935 --> 01:57.045
I'm moving out and I've got a new address
for you to forward my post to -

01:57.070 --> 01:58.345
Blow-job City.

01:58.370 --> 02:00.076
Jez, I've got to make a move.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.090
Cool. Um, here's that Beastie Boys CD
I was telling you about.

02:04.115 --> 02:06.076
Thanks, but I don't own a CD player.

02:06.101 --> 02:08.592
Oh. Yeah.
Well, download the shit out of them.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.000
- They're cool.
- Yeah?

02:10.025 --> 02:12.844
I think they started before I was born,
and one of them is dead.

02:12.869 --> 02:14.392
- Listen, gotta go.
- (KISSES)

02:14.440 --> 02:15.555
- See you.
- Bye.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.796
MARK: The gay <i>couple.
1</i> five with a gay <i>couple.</i>

02:17.840 --> 02:19.797
<i>It's political correctness gone normal.</i>

02:19.840 --> 02:21.990
I really like him, Mark.
Do you think it matters

02:22.040 --> 02:24.671
if I'm not young, dumb and full of cum?

02:24.696 --> 02:26.158
Oh, no. I mean...

02:26.200 --> 02:28.157
you're older and...

02:28.200 --> 02:30.555
- intelligent and full of cum.
- Yeah.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.511
Except I'm not that intelligent,

02:32.560 --> 02:36.155
because I don't really understand
almost any of what the news is about,

02:36.200 --> 02:37.918
and I'm not even certain that

02:37.960 --> 02:39.359
- I'm full of cum.
- Oh, I'm sure...

02:39.400 --> 02:41.232
<i>How did I get here?!</i>

02:41.280 --> 02:43.999
I'm sure you're full of cum.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.228
That's nice. Thank you.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.516
- So, thank you...
- The one <i>that</i> got away.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.709
<i>Lovely April.</i>

02:53.760 --> 02:57.196
<i>But you can't get away from Google, April.

<i>the maverick detectives

02:59.640 --> 03:04.555
Yup, she's just as beautiful as she was
when I failed to sleep with her in Darty.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.384
<i>And she knows a fuckload
about the Ottoman Empire.</i>

03:07.409 --> 03:09.393
<i>If she voices the audiobook,</i>

03:09.440 --> 03:12.353
<i>then it's, "Look out, St Basil!" because
I'm going to buy a box of wet wipes</i>

03:12.400 --> 03:15.242
<i>and have me a wanky Byzantine party.</i>

03:15.720 --> 03:18.951
Um, things haven't been great
between me and Joe lately.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.513
JEZ: Yeah, <i>that will happen when</i> he's <i>busy</i>

03:20.560 --> 03:23.996
<i>- sucking</i> off <i>your life coach.
-</i> Maybe we should have a big chat.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.635
And I should just say, like,
"Are you ready to commit? Because I am."

03:27.680 --> 03:28.875
What do you think?

03:28.920 --> 03:30.797
- No.
- Oh.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.592
- Right. Why not?
- The point is,

03:32.640 --> 03:35.393
you do your thing, yeah,
and let him do his thing.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.273
And don't talk about upsetting shit.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.469
That's the key to happiness.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.638
- That's not what I expected you to say.
- I'm a straight-shooter.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.751
<i>And I'm fucking your boyfriend.</i>
Time's <i>up,</i> I think.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.029
Oh, right.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.673
I'm going to call him.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.631
<i>No, don't call him!</i>

03:49.680 --> 03:50.909
Fuck it, I'm going to lock him out.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.155
<i>Yeah! Lock him out!</i>

03:52.200 --> 03:53.634
Do you want to, um...

03:54.640 --> 03:55.755
...stay for a glass of wine?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.473
Er... She's sexy,

03:57.520 --> 04:00.717
<i>artistic, confused. It'd be rude not to!</i>

04:02.160 --> 04:03.958
<i>We studied Ancient History at Dartmouth -</i>

04:04.000 --> 04:07.311
<i>but that's all ancient history!
Ha-ha-ha!</i>

04:07.360 --> 04:08.680
<i>No.</i>

04:08.720 --> 04:11.030
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.230
Hi. I love the Ottoman Empire.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.716
I think I feel an affinity because
some ingeniously savage children

04:17.760 --> 04:20.673
at my secondary school
called me "the sick man of Europe".

04:20.720 --> 04:22.472
<i>Sorry. TMI.</i>

04:22.520 --> 04:25.114
No! I was actually ostracised by

04:25.160 --> 04:28.118
some horrible girls
who called me Joan of Snark.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.390
<i>Two peas in a fucking pod.</i>

04:30.440 --> 04:33.512
- Er, who should I sign it to?
- Mark. Mark Corrigan.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.930
- OK
<i>- Does she recognise me?</i>

04:35.955 --> 04:37.393
<i>I should say something.</i>

04:37.440 --> 04:38.839
<i>Could come clean.</i>

04:38.880 --> 04:41.952
”You <i>sold me</i> some <i>brogues
and I followed you 200 miles</i>

04:42.000 --> 04:44.230
”and <i>faked being a mature student
to see you.</i> ”

04:44.280 --> 04:45.679
There you go. Thanks again for coming.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.075
<i>My</i> pleasure. <i>This is my chance.</i>

04:48.120 --> 04:49.679
<i>And I'm doing nothing.</i>

04:49.720 --> 04:51.757
<i>I am now, this instant,</i>

04:51.800 --> 04:54.360
<i>missing</i> my <i>chance.</i>
Sorry to flout the queueing system

04:54.400 --> 04:56.118
like some syphilitic sultan,

04:56.160 --> 04:59.312
but I just wanted to say that
we did actually meet once before.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.271
Years ago, at Dartmouth Uni.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.880
I thought I remembered you!
But I wasn't sure...

05:03.920 --> 05:06.753
I transferred from Coventry,
then I transferred back again.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.634
It was complicated. I think Bez
won Big <i>Brother</i> around then.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.910
Kilroy started Veritas. Crazy times.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.716
I'm rambling. But how would you like
to have a glass of wine?

05:19.160 --> 05:22.391
I have to say, this is the first time
I've ever betrayed the ethics

05:22.440 --> 05:24.431
of my life-coaching organisation.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.914
Well, it was outside

05:25.960 --> 05:28.554
- our coaching window.
- Yeah. I mean...

05:28.600 --> 05:31.433
I bet it's fine if football coaches
have sex with their players, so long as

05:31.480 --> 05:35.269
- it's outside the coaching window.
- Listen, Joe'II be back soon, so...

05:35.320 --> 05:37.994
- you should probably go.
- Oh, I'd <i>love</i> to <i>hang</i> out <i>with</i> Joe,

05:38.040 --> 05:40.236
<i>but maybe tonight isn't the best night.</i>

05:40.280 --> 05:43.318
I'm going to have to book a double session
just to talk this shit through!

05:43.360 --> 05:46.159
<i>I'm creating my own work!
I'm living off my own</i> mess.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.840
<i>Like when they fed all the cows
to the other cows in the 90s</i>

05:48.880 --> 05:50.951
<i>and we got... what was it? Super-burgers?</i>

05:52.520 --> 05:54.989
My day job's lecturing
at South Thames College.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.077
So this is your secret identity.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.191
- Sort of like Indiana Jones.
- Yes.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.278
I'm very much like Indiana Jones.
Except I don't have a whip.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.277
And I ain't afraid of no snakes!

06:04.320 --> 06:09.190
<i>An Indiana Jones reference mixed with
a Ghostbusters reference! I love you,</i>

06:09.240 --> 06:10.230
<i>April Danecroft.</i>

06:10.280 --> 06:12.999
I couldn't help noticing
that your book's co-written.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.474
<i>» That's my husband.
- Shit!</i>

06:14.520 --> 06:15.840
I still use my maiden name for books.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.518
<i>Of course. Of course she's married.</i>

06:17.560 --> 06:19.631
You write together? That sounds like a...

06:19.680 --> 06:22.752
- a dream sort of setup.
- Well, I do all the PR.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.552
And most of the bulk of the writing, too.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.194
<i>- Interesting.
-</i> I mean, it's fine.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.242
Angus is so busy with all his... research.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.352
<i>- Hello, resentment, my old friend.</i>

06:32.377 --> 06:34.390
<i>- I've come to stoke you up again.</i>

06:34.440 --> 06:37.831
Mark, I don't mean to be weird
or anything, but...

06:37.880 --> 06:40.394
did anything happen between us

06:40.440 --> 06:44.195
at one of MacLeish's weird Dar'ty Parties?

06:44.240 --> 06:47.915
No, I... I mean, if I can just search
the old memory banks...

06:47.960 --> 06:49.871
<i>...for the moment I replay nightly...</i>

06:49.920 --> 06:52.389
...we might have had one cuddle once,

06:52.440 --> 06:55.273
but that was about it, as I recall.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.150
Look, it was so great to see you again.

06:58.175 --> 07:00.070
I'd better go. Angus awaits.

07:00.120 --> 07:04.239
She's <i>leaving. Again. Come on, Mark!
Pull your dick from the stone!</i>

07:04.280 --> 07:07.750
As a matter of fact, I'm having
a dinner party tomorrow night.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.474
Ridiculously short notice, I know, but...

07:10.520 --> 07:12.033
Well, I'm free tomorrow.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.798
Although Angus is going to a conference.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.832
Well, why don't you come on your own?
It's not like you're chained together.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.029
Or are you?

07:18.080 --> 07:20.549
Not last time I checked. Clank Clank.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.637
Tomorrow. It's a date.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.798
I mean, that is the date
on which it shall happen.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.990
<i>- Great.
- Yes! Olympus has fallen.</i>

07:28.040 --> 07:32.034
<i>Now all I have to do is cook a meal
so delicious she will make love to me.</i>

07:32.080 --> 07:34.594
<i>Such as... cheesy pasta.</i>

07:36.040 --> 07:37.235
JOE: Jez, don't forget your phone!

07:37.280 --> 07:39.078
(BLENDER WHIRS)

07:39.120 --> 07:40.872
I thought you were going to the cinema

07:40.920 --> 07:42.115
- with Joe?
- Whatever.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.480
It'll start with half an hour of adverts

07:43.520 --> 07:45.431
which everyone site through
like obedient disciples

07:45.480 --> 07:48.279
of the capitalist dictatorship.
What the hell are you even doing?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.630
- I'm making hummus.
- Making hummus, he says,

07:50.680 --> 07:52.398
like it's perfectly natural.
No-one makes hummus.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.829
- It's only hummus, Jeremy.
- What are you going to do next?

07:54.880 --> 07:56.917
- Start making your own pasta?
- As a matter of fact,

07:56.960 --> 07:58.553
- I have made my own pasta.
- Jesus, Mark.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.752
Jamie Oliver and Sainsburys
make the food. We eat the food.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.590
April from Darty's coming over,
as it happens.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.216
The girl from the shoe shop?

08:06.241 --> 08:09.510
You finally tracked her down
and you're luring her back to your Iair

08:09.560 --> 08:11.073
to eat her with pasta.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.679
It isn't a lair, it's my flat!

08:12.720 --> 08:14.074
And my sole subterfuge

08:14.120 --> 08:16.555
is that she thinks
she's coming to a dinner party.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.309
But I've got a feeling that the other
guests may cancel at the last minute.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.510
Naughty, unreliable guests.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.312
- Finally I'm rubbing off on you.
- Jez,

08:24.360 --> 08:26.829
I think she might actually be
my perfect woman.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.917
She's a serious academic historian

08:28.960 --> 08:30.598
who got my joke about Indiana Jones!

08:30.640 --> 08:35.476
She just texted, saying,
"Professor Jones has her whip ready."

08:35.520 --> 08:37.716
I think it's probably the sexiest text

08:37.760 --> 08:40.070
- anyone has ever received!
- Wow.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.351
You should go the full Indy.
"I love you" on the eyelids.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.720
(LAUGHS) Brilliant.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.671
But far too mad.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.949
Go on! It'll be hilarious!

08:48.000 --> 08:50.389
I was thinking,
"How can I turn up the heat?"

08:50.440 --> 08:52.716
I could blink at her
as she came through the door.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.876
More than hilarious. It would be a hoot!

- Yes, Mark.

- Hey, Jezebel.

- Got off work early. Thought I'd see

- Megan.

- Joe.
- Megan!

09:46.480 --> 09:48.835
Joe popped over. What a fun coincidence.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.271
Are you having a coaching session, or...?

09:52.320 --> 09:54.391
No, he came round for a friendly visit.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.477
Why? Do you have
a coaching session booked?

09:56.520 --> 09:59.080
No, no. These are both just friendly,
coincidental visits.

Four and a half hours of tears
and sweat and pain

Hi there.
I know you've probably got plans tonight,

11:11.200 --> 11:15.273
but I insist you all stay
for a delicious feast.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.470
That might not be so convenient.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.796
Well, that's as it may be,
but I'm afraid I insist.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.356
Joe, Megan, it is going to be amazing.
You must stay.

- Er...
- Wonderful.

I'm sorry, but I need backup.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.510
Angus is coming. April's husband.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.076
You didn't mention the husband,
you dark, filthy, dirty horse.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.238
Yes, well, she's got a husband and,
in 30 minutes, he'll want some dinner.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.839
I need to bulk out.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.150
Lettuce!

- Bulky... lettuce?
- They'll bring wine, but we need booze.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.950
Where's the rum?
Get the rum, make a cocktail.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.991
- What cocktail?
- Any fucking thing.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.953
Rum and water, rum and milk.
Chop some parsley into it.

It's action stations!

to Mr Patel's and back?

Look, here we go.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.431
- Beans. Everyone likes beans.
- I can't serve baked beans.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.518
- Beans are pasta sauce.
- Beans are <i>not</i> pasta sauce!

12:10.560 --> 12:11.994
They're... tomato-y.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.269
Ketchup is tomato-y.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.755
- That's not a pasta sauce.
- It is when I make pasta.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.079
- What the hell are you doing?
- I... I'm picking the beans out.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.474

Are they? Yeah?

12:54.760 --> 12:59.118

Is it... Moroccan?

12:59.160 --> 13:00.275
Maybe it is Moroccan.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.878
Right, OK! I like it that way.

- Fuck them.
- Exactly.

- Listen, Mark.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.758
The pasta will be fine. It'll all be fine.

- Do you think?
- Absolutely.

I might have used permanent marker.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.671

eyes, bleach - is that a bad one?

13:37.120 --> 13:40.715

all night. Is that possible?

always brings wine, don't they?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.270
Oh... Lovely.

<i>That'll be one bottle of wine
between six, then. Perfect!</i>

14:02.522 --> 14:04.840
So, you and April
were at Dartmouth together?

Yes. Briefly.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.600

<i>Enjoy it. Last one of the night.</i>

14:13.972 --> 14:15.074
Shall we go through?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.191
Help yourself to hummus.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.757
It's freshly made
and, if I say so myself, quite delicious.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.598
<i>Unlike the rest of the meal.</i> Cocktail?

14:23.640 --> 14:27.998
<i>Mmmm, rum, water, lettuce, vinegar
and the secret ingredient - salt.</i>

14:28.040 --> 14:30.873
April said you were off to a conference.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.399
Yes. Date mix-up.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.080
But I think April will be able to join me.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.440
I'm actually talking tomorrow

14:36.480 --> 14:40.101
on transcultural memory
in the Ottoman Empire.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.353

- It's Moroccan. I love it.

<i>Blink impulse off the scale
and drink disgusting.</i>

14:49.930 --> 14:53.479
Um... I might take it slow,
leave some for your other guests.

14:53.520 --> 14:57.753
Good idea. I'll just go and see
where the other guests have got to.

Also, Megan, would you happen to have
a small make-up bag about your person?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.997
Oh, my <i>God.</i> Yeah, that'll work.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.634
- Yeah?
- Yeah, mate.

Do I claim fancy dress or go full English,

- button down, hope they don't mention?
- Look,

15:18.160 --> 15:21.471
you probably need to know,
Joe thinks Megan's fucking around on him

15:21.520 --> 15:23.477
and Megan thinks
Joe's fucking around on her.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.557
- Right. God.
- And...

15:25.600 --> 15:27.352
I happen to know that they're both right.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.936
Because I've sort of ended up
sleeping with both of them.

15:30.961 --> 15:34.222
- You're humping them both?
- To be honest, it's getting quite tiring.

15:34.247 --> 15:36.077
Especially when I have to do them
both in one day.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.556
Oh, that must be really hard.
I'm so sorry for you, Jez.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.318
Uh, uh... Eh-heh-heh-heh.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.670
Uh, uh, uh, eh-heh-heh-heh.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.949
Yeah.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.058
Oh the plus side, she's fucking around
on him and he's fucking around on her.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.031
So, if they find out about each other

15:51.080 --> 15:54.436
then I don't see
that they can make much of a fuss.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.199
Well, you can't fuck them both, I'm
afraid. That's not how civilisation works.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.709

16:02.640 --> 16:04.551

that she's actually an artist?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.558
- It's Megan.
- Oh, of course!

16:07.600 --> 16:09.637
Maggie's just a nickname.

16:09.680 --> 16:13.036
- That she hates.
- Are you wearing eyeshadow, Mark?

16:13.080 --> 16:15.549
Er, yes. That's s-something I'm doing.

16:15.600 --> 16:20.151

16:21.520 --> 16:23.716
So, you two are writing a book together?

16:23.760 --> 16:28.118
I do the bulk of the writing, but Angus's
ideas are what the book's built on.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.596
April's doing herself a disservice.
She's the real historian of the two of us.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.029
I think of myself more as a...

16:34.080 --> 16:35.354
as a theologian, really.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.597
- The Holy Roman Empire is a guilty pleasure...
- MARK: He's <i>very decent.</i>

16:38.640 --> 16:40.677
<i>Very wholesome.</i>

16:40.720 --> 16:43.917

- These aren't fashionable subjects.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.951
All above our heads.

Especially yours, eh, Jez?

<i>Always rely on Jez for a chuckle.
I'll show them.</i>

16:52.560 --> 16:56.349
Can I ask you a question, Angus,
of a theological nature?

16:56.400 --> 17:00.075
- I'll see what I can do.
- Did Jesus have...

17:00.120 --> 17:01.758
a cat?

17:01.800 --> 17:05.111
I wouldn't have thought personal pets
in the sense that we...

17:05.160 --> 17:07.231
- If you don't know, just say.
- Well...

17:07.280 --> 17:10.318
I do find it interesting
that all you pointy-heads,

17:10.359 --> 17:12.954
- living inside your Westminster bubble...
- I'm not a politician.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.833
People like you in your ivory towers,

17:15.880 --> 17:19.999
who are like, "Who gives a fuck
about the real issues?"

(CLEARS THROAT) Do dig in.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.192
- What is it?
- Um... It's Moroccan.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.038
Like my eyeshadow.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.559
Tastes like baked beans on spaghetti
with lettuce.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.319
I'd hate to call you a racist
at my dinner party,

17:36.360 --> 17:40.115
but I think it's a little more
sophisticated than that.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.514
It's from the Atlas Mountains.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.394
JEZ: <i>This is a disaster.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.510
<i>I'm Paxman.</i>

17:46.560 --> 17:49.632
To be honest, er,
I've never really got it about Jesus.

17:49.680 --> 17:54.800
I mean, apart from all the Christian
stuff, what did Jesus actually do?

17:54.840 --> 17:57.275
What did Jesus do...
apart from Christianity?

17:57.320 --> 18:00.551
- Yeah, put that aside.
- The moral universe we all live in?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.829
I'm not knocking the guy.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.934
I'm just saying, you know, apart
from that, what did he actually achieve?

18:05.959 --> 18:09.309
You know, I'm not saying I like him,
but at least Hitler did some paintings.

18:09.360 --> 18:12.239
If you're comparing Hitler and Jesus,
I'm afraid I'm out.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.634
Ooh, <i>hello!</i>

18:13.680 --> 18:15.796
<i>Naughty, naughty, Megan.</i>

18:15.840 --> 18:17.956
<i>Am I betraying Joe or Megan more?</i>

18:18.000 --> 18:20.276
<i>I like him loads, but I'm her life coach.</i>

18:20.320 --> 18:21.879
<i>What the fuck?</i>

18:21.920 --> 18:24.514
<i>Joe? No, don't cross the streams.</i>

18:24.560 --> 18:26.233
<i>- Shit!
-</i> What the hell?

18:26.280 --> 18:28.954
- I, um...
- That was actually Mark's foot.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.434
He does that sometimes for laughs.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.515
What?

18:31.560 --> 18:32.994
Put your foot in my groin under the table.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.236
- No, I don't.
- Mark's got his shoes on.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.953
He's quick. He slips them on and off.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.911
It's part of our flirty, dirty game.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.793
I have no idea what he's talking about.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.911
<i>There goes a valuable glassful.</i>

18:43.960 --> 18:45.792
- APRIL: What's going on?
- What's going on?!

18:45.840 --> 18:48.593
- My boyfriend is fucking my life coach.
- JOE: No, Megan.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.551
- Can we talk about this, please?
- MARK: Oh, <i>brilliant.</i>

18:50.600 --> 18:52.671
<i>Freak-show sideshow at the shit-show.</i>

18:52.720 --> 18:53.994
MEGAN: What the fuck were you doing?

18:54.040 --> 18:56.687
JOE: What was I doing?
What the fuck were you doing?

18:56.712 --> 18:57.992
I might leave them to it.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.350
<i>Ohh, the Corrigan stare.</i>

19:00.400 --> 19:01.629
<i>The full Paddington.</i>

19:04.000 --> 19:06.594
I need a cigarette.
Has anyone got a cigarette?

19:06.640 --> 19:07.835
I thought you'd given up.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.393
I thought things, you thought things.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.800
Turns out, people can surprise you.

19:10.825 --> 19:11.750
<i>Hello!</i>

19:11.800 --> 19:14.041
Go on. Fine. Choke yourself.

19:14.066 --> 19:15.478
At least I tell you
when I'm breaking a promise.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.254
<i>Stop actually rubbing my</i> hands.

19:18.279 --> 19:21.695
Sorry, it's just a...
bit of a flashback to Corfu.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.172
- Corfu?
- ANGUS: Er, it's nothing.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.012
Not nothing.

19:26.037 --> 19:29.720
When we were in Corfu last summer,
we had a little relationship trouble.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.878
I'm sure all's well now.
I-I don't want to pry.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.196
<i>Wheedle, wheedle, pry and needle.</i>

19:35.240 --> 19:38.551
We've had counselling, we've dealt
with the issues, we've moved on.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.671
But the wounds are still there.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.315
That can happen with wounds.
It can be good to give them a good...

19:44.360 --> 19:46.237
inspection now and again.

19:46.280 --> 19:50.433
As a penance, I went to live with
the monks on Mount Athos for three months.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.993
Ten weeks.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.872
Ten weeks, whatever.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.151
Apparently, he lived on nothing
but dry bread and goat's milk.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.511
But when I picked him up, there were
a lot of Nutella jars in his recycling.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.870
I know, and I'm sorry.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.407
I can be weak.

20:04.432 --> 20:06.277
Weak how exactly, Angus?

20:06.320 --> 20:08.485
You don't have to achieve sainthood.

20:08.510 --> 20:11.591
Just, ooh, try not to fuck anyone else.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.297
<i>This is amazing.</i>

20:13.322 --> 20:14.998
<i>So uncomfortable.</i>

20:15.040 --> 20:17.634
<i>This could be my night
of greatest triumph.</i>

20:17.659 --> 20:21.871
<i>If we weren't all about to die
from eating these poisonous eggs.</i>

20:23.320 --> 20:25.960
For the cheese course,
I have a soft cheese...

20:26.000 --> 20:29.197
<i>Dairylea moulded together
with my bare hands.</i>

20:29.240 --> 20:34.440
- ...plus a tasty young Stilton.
- Ingenious. But totally mental.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.391
<i>MARK: Out of bread and crackers.</i>

20:36.440 --> 20:38.351
<i>Just need to state it with conviction.</i>

20:38.400 --> 20:42.180
It's time for cheese and lettuce.
Most <i>natural combination</i> in the <i>world.</i>

20:42.205 --> 20:46.151
- So, we've got good news.
- We're going to make a go of it.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.961
We're looking at the possibility
of moving forward as a three.

20:49.986 --> 20:51.513
Becoming a... triangle.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.872
A very respectful, very boundaried,
rather horny triangle.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.207
With guidelines.

20:57.232 --> 20:58.594
Three-ism.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.869
Th... Three-ism?

20:59.920 --> 21:02.560
Well, I think it's great
you're trying to approach the situation

21:02.600 --> 21:03.954
in the most adult way possible.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.037
My God. Is that what you want?

21:06.080 --> 21:10.995
To give it a go with her and me
in some kind of triangle?

21:11.040 --> 21:16.399
MARK: <i>Oh, Angus. You just can't</i> seem <i>to
say the right thing, you lovely</i> arsehofe.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.567
(SIGHS) I'm sorry this all happened here.

21:19.592 --> 21:22.555
<i>Just very sensitively shut her in.</i>

21:22.600 --> 21:26.421
I am upset.
It's obviously still a bit raw.

21:26.446 --> 21:27.713
But I do still love him.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.195
Of course. Of course you do.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.153
- Can you tell him I need to talk to him?
<i>- Maybe I will, April.</i>

21:33.200 --> 21:36.272
<i>Although you might have picked
a slightly corrupt postman.</i>

21:36.320 --> 21:41.349
OK, I mean, this is very exciting, but I
might need to make a move home, so, Joe...

21:41.400 --> 21:44.489
Oh, I thought Joe
was staying here tonight,

21:44.514 --> 21:46.648
um... according to the guidelines.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.233
No, it's Saturday,
so it's a Joe and Megan night.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.230
Right, but you spent last night together.

21:52.255 --> 21:56.021
Um... "On no two consecutive nights
shall..." Et cetera, et cetera.

21:56.046 --> 21:58.798
Yeah, but you two already fucked today.
It's my turn for a go on Joe.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.142
Oh, OK.

22:00.167 --> 22:04.069
Well, then, yeah, I mean,
I guess it's up to Joe.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.590
Is it? Is there a rule for...?

22:07.640 --> 22:09.995
Oh, this is fucking bullshit!

22:10.040 --> 22:11.838
(ANGUS CLEARS HIS THROAT)

22:11.880 --> 22:13.791
- What did she say?
- Look,

22:13.840 --> 22:17.377
don't shoot the messenger,
but April said she...

22:17.402 --> 22:18.519
doesn't want to speak to you.

22:18.560 --> 22:22.599
She loves you,
but she's not sure she likes you.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.916
- Right.
<i>- Naughty postman.</i>

22:24.960 --> 22:26.792
<i>Drink down my lies, Angus.</i>

22:26.840 --> 22:28.597
<i>They taste good, don't they?</i>

22:28.622 --> 22:29.550
Is this Ribena?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.035
Yes, it's Ribena. I'm an alcoholic.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.232
I'm a complicated guy
with a complicated past.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.351
Like you and April.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.950
- Why did you have to sleep with her?
- I'm right here!

22:41.000 --> 22:43.753
Oh, everything was all right when you were
humping two people, but when I started,

22:43.800 --> 22:45.632
- that's not allowed?
- No, no,

22:45.680 --> 22:47.432
you knew we were humping
when we humped.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.706
You kept Megan a secret
because you like her more than me.

22:49.731 --> 22:50.954
Admit it.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.073
No! I won't fucking admit it,
because it's not true.

22:55.120 --> 23:00.302
Angus loves you, but...
he doesn't know if he respects you.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.831
- April...
- I was just explaining.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.589
- I-I think I got it right, that...
- I need some space to think.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.109
Uh-huh. That's wise.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.605
I understand. I'll go.

23:11.630 --> 23:13.463
<i>That's right, off you fuck.</i>

23:13.488 --> 23:17.115
April, if you like, there's a B&B nearby,

23:17.160 --> 23:19.549
or I can take the sofa and you can...

23:19.600 --> 23:22.187
That's kind, Mark, but I want to go home.

23:22.212 --> 23:24.356
- Gus, do you mind staying here?
- Of course.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.536
Let's talk anon.

23:26.561 --> 23:28.111
Bye, Mark.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.480
And thank you.

23:30.458 --> 23:34.719
<i>Great. She's gone and I'm left with the
Jesus lunk who, because of manners,</i>

23:34.760 --> 23:39.277
<i>- I</i> can't <i>simply push</i> out the window.
- MEGAN: For God's sake, this is pathetic.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.436
- I never asked you to fight over me.
- Get off!

23:41.480 --> 23:45.917
Yeah, the fighting phase
seems to be ending, actually.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.429
Oh, for fuck's sake!

23:49.920 --> 23:53.985
Thank you, Mark, for letting me stay.
You're a good man.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.353
I feel like I want to talk.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.676
You know, really talk, about...

23:58.720 --> 24:01.792
sin and man and God and love

24:01.840 --> 24:03.592
and the mystery of the Trinity.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.551
Right.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.432
Yes? <i>Yep,</i>

24:07.480 --> 24:08.709
<i>let's sit here, me and my make-up,</i>

24:08.760 --> 24:13.515
<i>and drink vinegar and lettuce and rum
and eat moulded Dairylea</i>

24:13.540 --> 24:17.432
<i>and scribbled Cheddar
and talk it all through forever,</i>

24:17.480 --> 24:19.835
<i>while those two gently hump in the corner.</i>
