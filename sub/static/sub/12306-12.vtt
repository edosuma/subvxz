00:26.350 --> 00:27.886
Woman: Can you hold, please?

00:27.890 --> 00:29.654
Thank you.

00:29.660 --> 00:30.855
Mayor ha yes' office.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.453
I'm sorry.
He's unavailable.

00:32.460 --> 00:34.997
May I take a message?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.196
I'll let him know.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.904
Hey, leon.
Check this out.

00:45.910 --> 00:48.299
What's that?

00:48.310 --> 00:51.302
Some kind of music box?

00:51.310 --> 00:52.971
Who sent it?

00:52.980 --> 00:54.641
No return address.

00:54.650 --> 00:55.913
[music tinkles]

00:55.920 --> 00:57.376
[ticking]

00:57.390 --> 00:59.882
Stop. Put it down.

01:03.490 --> 01:05.379
Leon, do you see that?

01:05.390 --> 01:06.824
Why is it doing that?

01:06.830 --> 01:07.820
Get the bomb squad

01:07.830 --> 01:10.026
And clear
the building now!

01:10.030 --> 01:11.191
Everyone, out now!

01:11.200 --> 01:12.668
Mary, is the mayor
in his office?

01:12.670 --> 01:13.660
I don't know.

01:13.670 --> 01:14.535
Hey. What the hell?

01:14.540 --> 01:16.099
Where's the mayor?
He's not here.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.430
What is this?
Let's go. Now. Out.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.067
I said let's go.
Out!

01:19.080 --> 01:22.436
["Pop goes the weasel" playing]

01:23.780 --> 01:26.101
[music stops]

01:27.720 --> 01:31.588
[song finishes]

01:47.540 --> 01:49.133
[knock on door]

01:49.140 --> 01:50.266
I got a warrant
to search

01:50.270 --> 01:51.567
Perry whitley's
dorm room.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.709
Come in.
Shut the door.

01:53.710 --> 01:55.974
We confiscated his
phone and computer.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.142
Cyber unit's going
through them now.

01:58.150 --> 02:01.415
Perry would have encrypted
anything incriminating.

02:01.420 --> 02:02.740
Don't worry.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.945
No one knows.

02:03.950 --> 02:05.315
I was discreet.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.788
Thank you, janice.

02:06.790 --> 02:07.882
Has he been
processed yet?

02:07.890 --> 02:09.619
We still have 36 hours
to build a case.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.053
I'm not gonna let him
walk. We'll find something.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.221
We have to.
First-time offense,

02:13.230 --> 02:14.550
They'll knock it down
to a misdemeanor.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.770
Unless we ask for help
from the d.A.'s office.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.467
We get amanda on board.

02:21.470 --> 02:24.167
It'll all come out--
my real identity,

02:24.170 --> 02:25.660
Ray matthews
in seattle.

02:25.670 --> 02:27.434
You trusted me.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.408
I think we can
trust amanda.

02:29.410 --> 02:32.744
The minute I go in front
of the judge as a victim,

02:32.750 --> 02:34.844
I'll have to do it
as michelle webber.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.410
Maybe that's not
a bad thing.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.081
I have to think
about it. I--

02:39.090 --> 02:40.410
[knock on door]

02:40.420 --> 02:42.752
The mayor's office
received a threat.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.114
They asked for you.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.985
Ok.

02:50.970 --> 02:53.928
Beth: The mayor gets a
dozen or so threats a year.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.430
Most are easily
traceable--

02:55.440 --> 02:56.794
Phone calls, e-mails.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.107
I handle them
personally.

02:58.110 --> 02:59.339
The mayor's a friend.

02:59.340 --> 03:00.364
Yes. I'm well aware.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.870
He endorsed you
as lieutenant

03:01.880 --> 03:03.006
And head of the tau.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.604
He gets
special treatment.

03:05.610 --> 03:08.216
He's the mayor,
jack.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.146
Hello, leon.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.117
Lieutenant.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.452
Beth, this way.
Thank your coming.

03:17.460 --> 03:20.657
Cedric, I want you to
meet detective jack larsen.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.196
Jack, this is
cedric brown,

03:22.200 --> 03:24.521
Chief aide
to mayor ha yes.

03:27.870 --> 03:30.635
Beth, it's good
to see you.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.905
I want to introduce you
to detective jack larsen.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.332
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.980
Beth: So I heard you
received a gift this morning.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.176
Cedric: Yes. Uh,
forensics has it.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.012
It arrived by courier
to the mail room,

03:42.020 --> 03:43.317
No return address.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.640
That's the box
that it came in.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.516
How did an unmarked
package make it to third floor?

03:46.520 --> 03:48.989
Is there no protocol in
place to monitor the mail?

03:48.990 --> 03:51.925
Well, it's not a perfect
system, detective.

03:51.930 --> 03:54.991
The package is addressed
to judas ha yes.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.422
Judas betrayed Jesus.

03:56.430 --> 03:59.320
This could have been an angry
constituent who feels betrayed.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.523
Does anybody
come to mind?

04:00.540 --> 04:02.998
Cedric: Well, it's, uh, the
mayor's office, detective.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.229
It would be impossible
to point at one person.

04:05.240 --> 04:08.403
We've received a dozen
threats this year alone.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.276
Beth: And tau is handling
all of those threats,

04:10.280 --> 04:12.499
But most of the threats
to this office come

04:12.510 --> 04:14.274
By e-mail or phone.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.839
Sending a package,
that's aggressive.

04:16.850 --> 04:17.942
It's a jack-in-the-box.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.178
Let's not get
carried away.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.386
The song it played
was "pop goes the weasel."

04:21.390 --> 04:23.688
Weasel is another term
for traitor.

04:23.690 --> 04:25.249
Cedric: Your point.

04:25.260 --> 04:27.251
Could be politically
motivated.

04:27.260 --> 04:30.798
Beth: We're going to need copies
of all negative correspondence

04:30.800 --> 04:32.029
That have come
to this office

04:32.030 --> 04:33.862
In the last
12 months.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.861
I'll send it over
asap.

04:35.870 --> 04:38.840
Great. We'll be in touch.

04:41.440 --> 04:45.070
Mayor's big
on family values.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.047
He campaigned on it,

04:46.050 --> 04:47.472
That and balancing
the budget.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.869
Word is he's planning
to run for governor.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.449
That is wife?

04:51.450 --> 04:53.612
Wife elaine is his
campaign manager.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.714
It's a bill and
hillary situation.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.950
He's charming, she's
the political shark,

04:57.960 --> 05:00.281
Only they have a son
instead of a daughter.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.450
He was elected twice
on a reform platform,

05:02.460 --> 05:03.894
But his approval ratings
plummeted

05:03.900 --> 05:06.289
After his budget cuts
last year.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.392
Forensic test
came back.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.936
No fingerprints were
found on the jack-in-a-box.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.897
Were they able to track
the package delivery?

05:10.910 --> 05:12.560
It was delivered
from a local mailbox store,

05:12.570 --> 05:14.436
But it didn't have
any video cameras,

05:14.440 --> 05:15.805
And the sender
paid in cash.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.232
A lot of disgruntled
citizens out there,

05:17.250 --> 05:21.448
People mad at everything from
police violence to cracked sidewalks.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.009
We're looking for
someone who sees

05:23.020 --> 05:25.079
The mayor
as a traitor.

05:25.090 --> 05:27.309
Janice, remember the guy
from last year,

05:27.320 --> 05:29.288
Claimed he was a victim
of police brutality,

05:29.290 --> 05:31.952
Showed up at the mayor's
office demanding to see him?

05:31.960 --> 05:33.655
Ken buck.
Ken buck.

05:33.660 --> 05:38.826
Yeah. His transcript
should be here somewhere.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.025
Ok. The report says

05:40.040 --> 05:42.259
That he called the mayor
a "traitorous fool,"

05:42.270 --> 05:46.503
Said he should be "executed
by firing squad."

05:48.280 --> 05:49.679
Let's talk to him.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.444
You threatened
the mayor.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.599
That was
a long time ago.

05:52.610 --> 05:53.805
But you believe
he's a traitor.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.310
Buck: He promised that
if he was elected

05:55.320 --> 05:57.140
He would clean up
the police department,

05:57.150 --> 05:58.515
Get rid of the bad cops.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.887
Jack: And you think he
deserves to be punished.

06:00.890 --> 06:02.881
I think the leaders
of this city should be

06:02.890 --> 06:04.187
Held accountable, yeah.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.783
You filed a report
a few years back

06:05.790 --> 06:07.986
Claiming
police brutality.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.320
Cop smacked me
around,

06:09.330 --> 06:11.662
Broke my nose,
knocked out two teeth.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.321
Says you were drunk,
took a swing at him.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.296
That's a lie.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.665
Either way, you never
got satisfaction.

06:16.670 --> 06:19.037
That anger and resentment
has just been building.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.667
Look. I was
pissed off about it

06:20.680 --> 06:23.536
For a while, ok,
but I got over it.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.972
I joined a local
political group.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.176
Now we write letters,
we hold marches,

06:27.180 --> 06:28.250
We fight for change.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.570
And when that change
doesn't happen,

06:29.590 --> 06:31.581
Do you go after the person
you think is responsible?

06:31.590 --> 06:33.319
Buck: I don't care
about the mayor.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.481
He's not
the problem.

06:34.490 --> 06:36.857
It's the system. It's
rigged against us.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.521
If you're rich,
you got a voice.

06:38.530 --> 06:42.728
If not, you're out
in the cold.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.767
What do you think?

06:44.770 --> 06:45.760
Is he our guy?

06:45.770 --> 06:47.329
He's a political
activist.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.763
He's in your face.
He's not hiding.

06:49.770 --> 06:53.434
Our stalker prefers
to be in the shadows.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.360
[clatter]

07:15.430 --> 07:17.421
[beep beep]

07:41.260 --> 07:43.058
Aah!

08:14.420 --> 08:17.981
Please help! Help!

08:17.990 --> 08:19.287
Help!

08:19.290 --> 08:22.692
Let me in!
Help, help!

08:22.700 --> 08:24.498
Let me in!

08:38.780 --> 08:41.750
Is this what your
attacker looked like?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.281
That's right.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.281
They all look
like jesters.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.156
Traditionally, the duty
of the jester

08:49.160 --> 08:50.685
Was to point out
the folly of the king.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.784
You being the king
in this scenario.

08:52.790 --> 08:55.851
Is it possible that someone
in your administration

08:55.860 --> 08:57.123
Could be upset
with you?

08:57.130 --> 08:59.167
I doubt it.
I handpick all my people.

08:59.170 --> 09:01.320
And everybody
loves you, right?

09:01.340 --> 09:03.160
What were you doing in that
neighborhood so late at night

09:03.170 --> 09:05.229
Without
a security detail?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.639
I was visiting
a friend.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.562
Man or a woman?

09:07.580 --> 09:10.208
Are you insinuating
something, detective?

09:10.210 --> 09:11.644
It's a question.

09:11.650 --> 09:12.970
Stalker left
a note--

09:12.980 --> 09:14.800
"Stay away
from her."

09:14.820 --> 09:16.811
Would you excuse us,
detective larsen?

09:16.820 --> 09:21.280
I'd like a moment alone to
speak to lieutenant davis.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.222
I'll wait outside.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.365
You know I'm planning
a run for governor.

09:37.370 --> 09:40.101
You think this has something
to do with the campaign?

09:40.110 --> 09:42.033
I'm not sure,

09:42.040 --> 09:44.907
But I know you're
going to find out.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.207
It's my job.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.700
And you're good at it.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.869
I trust you to be
discreet.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.111
Well, mayor, trust
is a two-way street.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.885
[sighs]

09:54.890 --> 09:55.880
There's a girl.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.086
She's young,
college age.

09:58.090 --> 10:00.127
I was leaving
her apartment last night

10:00.130 --> 10:01.529
When I was attacked.

10:01.530 --> 10:03.851
How long have you
been seeing her?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.360
Not long. We've only
met recently.

10:05.370 --> 10:08.590
And you think this is the
girl referred to in the note?

10:09.870 --> 10:11.099
In order to catch
your stalker,

10:11.110 --> 10:14.865
I need to know what the
relationship is with this girl.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.440
We're friends.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.747
Friends?

10:18.750 --> 10:21.378
I need you to keep this
under wraps.

10:21.380 --> 10:24.918
Any impropriety could
be trouble for me.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.550
Can I trust you to
keep this between us?

10:28.560 --> 10:33.225
Of course.
What's her name?

10:33.230 --> 10:36.450
Alice vargas.

10:39.070 --> 10:41.391
He's definitely
having an affair.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.629
He said he wasn't.
Trust me.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.130
He's lying. We should
talk to his wife.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.632
If it's cheating, you
always talk to the spouse.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.075
_ We can't just go
accusing the mayor's wife.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.071
We can question her,
get an alibi.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.902
She's the obvious
suspect.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.740
The mayor's
a decent man.

10:55.750 --> 10:56.842
I believe him.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.740
Decent men can't
make mistakes?

10:59.760 --> 11:05.290
Does this always circle back to
your epic tale of personal redemption?

11:05.290 --> 11:08.419
I'm glad you can joke
at my expense.

11:08.430 --> 11:11.491
Me, too. It's been
a long week.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.661
Ben: Forensics came
back on the doll.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.422
It was a standard
mannequin rigged

11:14.440 --> 11:15.930
With a battery
and motion sensor.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.260
The head was
handmade, though.

11:17.270 --> 11:18.704
No prints,
but our stalker's

11:18.710 --> 11:20.007
Definitely creative.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.102
What about
alice vargas?

11:21.110 --> 11:23.772
Alice vargas, 21,
no family.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.145
Her mother died
last month.

11:25.150 --> 11:27.972
Irs records show she
made $21,000 last year,

11:27.980 --> 11:29.470
Yet she lives in the
bradford arms apartments.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.016
10 bucks says the mayor's
paying her rent.

11:31.020 --> 11:33.443
Actually, the rent's being
automatically withdrawn

11:33.460 --> 11:35.212
From alice's
personal account.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.109
You can owe me.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.280
So where's alice
getting her money from?

11:39.290 --> 11:42.055
World's oldest
profession.

11:43.830 --> 11:46.390
L.A. Fantasy companions.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.868
An escort site?

11:47.870 --> 11:48.735
Ben: And very high end.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.196
Customers pay up
to 3,000 a night

11:50.210 --> 11:51.700
To have a beautiful
girl on their arm.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.166
You pay the service
for a girl's time.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.308
Sex is arranged
and paid for privately.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.779
Let's pay alice vargas
a Visit.

12:06.220 --> 12:09.258
I'm sorry, but I can't
talk about my clients.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.409
Beth: The mayor
sent us.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.727
He'd want you
to be candid.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.153
Unfortunately, my
service does not allow us

12:14.160 --> 12:16.857
To confirm or deny the
identities of my clients.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.430
That's a good policy
until it's not.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.091
I'm gonna level
with you, alice.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.499
You are a prostitute
operating

12:22.500 --> 12:23.592
Within a gray area
of the law,

12:23.610 --> 12:26.102
And we can make life
very difficult for you.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.430
You're threatening me?

12:27.440 --> 12:28.510
We're not after you,

12:28.510 --> 12:29.500
But we need
information.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.569
We think someone may
be targeting the mayor

12:31.580 --> 12:33.002
Because of his
relationship with you.

12:33.010 --> 12:34.239
Someone jealous
or obsessive.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.344
Can you think
of anyone like that?

12:36.350 --> 12:38.546
What about
boyfriends, angry exes,

12:38.550 --> 12:40.279
Overattentive
customers?

12:40.290 --> 12:41.849
There was this one guy.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.783
His name was
drew summers.

12:43.790 --> 12:44.860
A client?

12:44.860 --> 12:46.624
We only went out
a few times.

12:46.630 --> 12:48.382
He was very controlling.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.697
He said he wanted
to marry me

12:49.700 --> 12:53.261
And whisk me off
to some fairytale life.

12:53.270 --> 12:54.726
Did you tell anyone?

12:54.740 --> 12:55.593
No. I broke it off,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.194
Said I couldn't
see him anymore.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.405
He screamed at me

12:59.410 --> 13:01.105
And told me
I'd regret it.

13:01.110 --> 13:02.805
Has he contacted
you lately?

13:02.810 --> 13:04.539
Have you see him
anywhere, following you?

13:04.550 --> 13:06.541
No. I blocked
his number,

13:06.550 --> 13:08.109
And I forgot
about it.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.114
He does seem
the angry, out-there type.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.724
Cyber unit cracked
the encryption

13:21.730 --> 13:23.926
On perry's hard drive.

13:23.930 --> 13:25.489
What'd they find?

13:25.500 --> 13:28.891
A folder filled
with artwork

13:35.640 --> 13:37.734
Are they all
like this?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.673
Looks that way.

13:41.350 --> 13:43.614
Cat and mouse.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.509
He's taunting us.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.012
What do we do?

13:49.420 --> 13:50.956
Call amanda.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.588
Bring her
up to speed.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.420
You sure?

14:03.770 --> 14:05.260
Man: Look.
I'm an accountant.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.159
I don't know
anything about dolls

14:07.180 --> 14:08.807
Or scary makeup.

14:08.810 --> 14:11.199
But you know alice vargas. Who?

14:11.210 --> 14:14.009
The girl you've been
paying to be your escort.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.010
Jack: Cut the crap, drew.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.273
We know you're one
of her customers.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.610
Alice says you made
threats against her.

14:18.620 --> 14:22.158
I was upset. We'd
been seeing each other

14:22.160 --> 14:25.983
And there's something
really special between us,

14:25.990 --> 14:27.219
And she broke
things off

14:27.230 --> 14:28.959
Without any
explanation.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.792
So you started
stalking her to find out

14:30.800 --> 14:31.995
Who else she was seeing.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.024
No. That's--that's--

14:33.030 --> 14:34.225
Jack: No?
That's not right.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.696
We spoke _to the
doorman in alice's building.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.498
You were there
last night.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.332
He refused
to let you in, right?

14:40.340 --> 14:41.978
You became
verbally abusive.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.300
And shortly after that,
a man was attacked

14:43.310 --> 14:45.642
In the alley
behind alice's apartment.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.675
One of alice's customers.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.045
That wasn't me.

14:49.050 --> 14:50.870
I-I swear.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.143
Look. I was there.

14:53.150 --> 14:54.242
I had a few drinks.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.489
I could get a hold
of alice,

14:55.490 --> 14:57.310
So I thought I
would go to her place

14:57.330 --> 15:00.356
And, you know, just
see if she would talk.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.522
- But she was
with someone else.

15:02.530 --> 15:03.998
So you waited
till he left,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.392
No, no. I-I-- the
doorman told me to leave,

15:08.400 --> 15:10.038
Or he was gonna
call the cops,

15:10.040 --> 15:10.836
Which I did,

15:10.840 --> 15:12.035
And then I went
back to my car,

15:12.040 --> 15:14.259
I sobered up,
and I drove home.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.679
Can anyone
confirm that?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.704
N-n-n-no.

15:16.710 --> 15:19.680
Look. I'm not stupid.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.910
I know that alice
sees other guys.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.740
I just went
over there last night

15:23.750 --> 15:28.017
To let her know,
just to remind her

15:28.020 --> 15:30.284
Of how much we mean
to one another.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.782
She made herself
pretty clear, drew.

15:32.790 --> 15:36.420
You need to leave
her alone.

15:37.460 --> 15:42.933
I am very happy
to give alice some space...

15:44.310 --> 15:47.666
But do not ask me
to give up hope.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.202
Jack: He's definitely
love-obsessed,

15:52.210 --> 15:53.245
But is he our stalker?

15:53.250 --> 15:54.706
I was watching him.
He didn't react

15:54.720 --> 15:55.710
To the jack-in-the-box.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.245
Which means either
it didn't register--

15:57.250 --> 15:58.615
Or he was purposely
ignoring it.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.543
He's lonely, he's
awkward, he's lost contact

16:00.560 --> 16:01.789
With the object
of his obsession,

16:01.790 --> 16:03.053
And now he's
lashing out.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.152
And he may be
delusional.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.049
I mean, he's built this
relationship in his mind

16:06.060 --> 16:07.653
That will never
match up to reality.

16:07.660 --> 16:08.923
Put a unit on summers.

16:08.930 --> 16:11.353
I want him watched
day and night.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.148
Paul?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.657
[door creaks, shuts]

17:12.490 --> 17:14.549
Oh, god.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.388
Woman: 911.
What is your emergency?

17:21.400 --> 17:23.334
My apartment's
been robbed.

17:23.339 --> 17:24.660
What is your address?

17:24.670 --> 17:29.130
Uh, the bradford arms,
apartment 1103.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.199
[glass breaks]

17:31.210 --> 17:33.008
I think the person's
still here.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.409
Ma'am, get out
of the apartment.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.616
Police are
on their way.

17:39.490 --> 17:40.548
Aah!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.585
[whimpers]

17:49.700 --> 17:51.225
[police radio chatter]

17:51.230 --> 17:53.028
Ben: Hey. So the doorman
took a break.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.191
He didn't see anything.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.760
We're pulling footage
from the security cameras.

17:56.770 --> 17:57.840
This is an act of rage.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.899
He's hurt,
lashing out.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.207
Well, it's not
drew summers.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.008
Surveillance teams say
he did not leave

18:03.010 --> 18:04.171
His house last night.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.501
You need to see this.

18:19.530 --> 18:20.725
Jack: He's changed
targets.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.597
Now he's warning alice
to stay away from the mayor.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.852
Maybe the mayor
didn't listen,

18:24.870 --> 18:26.360
So he decided
to go after her.

18:26.370 --> 18:27.462
Are we sure
it's a he?

18:27.470 --> 18:29.268
The mayor and alice
both confirm their

18:29.270 --> 18:30.362
Attacker was a man.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.031
The mayor's wife
could have hired someone.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.964
So you're gonna accuse
the mayor's wife?

18:34.980 --> 18:36.379
Heh. Good luck with that.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.609
No. I'm gonna
question her

18:37.610 --> 18:40.307
And rule her out
as a suspect.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.142
All right. We're
gonna tread lightly,

18:43.150 --> 18:45.949
And I'm gonna do
the talking.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.561
How do you like
your jail cell?

19:02.570 --> 19:04.766
I'm used
to student housing.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.909
You're in trouble,
perry.

19:06.910 --> 19:09.106
Felony assault carries
a minimum sentence

19:09.110 --> 19:11.738
Of 4 years
in state prison.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.275
Is that why you
brought me here,

19:13.280 --> 19:16.113
To tell me something
I already know?

19:16.120 --> 19:17.849
No.

19:17.850 --> 19:20.342
I brought you in here
to help you.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.182
We know about the drawings
of lieutenant davis,

19:23.190 --> 19:25.921
The ones showing
you killing her,

19:25.930 --> 19:27.819
Strangling her.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.423
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

19:29.430 --> 19:32.422
We know you've been
stalking lieutenant davis

19:32.430 --> 19:33.625
For a while now.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.290
You sent her
letters, gifts,

19:35.300 --> 19:36.768
Broke into her house.

19:36.770 --> 19:37.931
We have a signed
affidavit

19:37.940 --> 19:39.499
From tracy wright
stating that you entered

19:39.510 --> 19:40.534
Into a relationship
with her

19:40.540 --> 19:42.770
For the sole purpose
of gaining access

19:42.780 --> 19:44.532
To lieutenant davis.

19:44.550 --> 19:49.340
Wow! I sound
horrible.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.282
You're gonna have
a hard time convincing

19:52.290 --> 19:55.282
People I did
any of that.

19:55.290 --> 19:58.351
I'm a good boy,
detective.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.550
Hello.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.629
I'm deputy d.A.
Amanda taylor.

20:06.630 --> 20:09.133
I'm here to offer
you a deal.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.869
It's a one-time offer.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.134
When I leave,
it goes with me.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.301
What sort of deal
is it?

20:14.310 --> 20:17.632
You're gonna plead guilty
to stalking lieutenant davis.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.200
In exchange, we will
drop the assault charge.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.813
We're looking
at a few years' probation.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.072
You get to go back
to school

20:24.090 --> 20:26.149
And put all of this
behind you.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.312
But I have to
undergo

20:28.320 --> 20:29.310
A psychiatric
evaluation

20:29.320 --> 20:32.483
By one of your
state-appointed doctors.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.026
Like I said, this is
a one-time offer.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.692
You should take it
while I'm feeling generous.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.021
That's very sweet
of you to think of me,

20:39.030 --> 20:41.397
But I have a feeling
you don't have anything,

20:41.400 --> 20:43.266
Or else you
wouldn't be here.

20:43.270 --> 20:46.001
You tried to
kill me, perry.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.331
Two officers
withessed it.

20:48.340 --> 20:49.876
It's a slam dunk case.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.200
Doubt that.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.371
You provoked me.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.178
“You were _in collusion
with your superior

20:54.180 --> 20:55.272
To railroad me.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.441
You're delusional.

20:56.450 --> 20:59.511
You're looking
at 4 years, perry.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.989
Think about that.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.030
I think I should
seek counsel.

21:06.030 --> 21:09.250
Let me know when my
dad and his lawyer get here.

21:11.060 --> 21:14.496
[indistinct chatter]

21:16.740 --> 21:18.037
Beth: Elaine.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.360
Lieutenant davis.

21:19.370 --> 21:20.769
Are you here
to volunteer?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.101
Not yet.
Um, I was wondering

21:23.110 --> 21:24.578
If we could have
a little talk.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.105
So does this have
something to do

21:26.110 --> 21:27.703
With the attack
on will?

21:27.720 --> 21:28.744
We're not sure yet.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.071
Do you know a woman
named alice vargas?

21:31.090 --> 21:33.741
No. I don't
believe so. Why?

21:33.760 --> 21:36.457
Because she knows
your husband.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.916
We have reason to believe
that the mayor

21:37.930 --> 21:41.150
Was targeted because of his
association with miss vargas.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.322
I'm not aware
of any association,

21:43.330 --> 21:45.424
And of course, my husband
has many colleagues.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.889
The nature of the stalking
is personal, resentful.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.561
Do you know why
someone might be jealous

21:50.570 --> 21:52.231
Of his relationship
with this woman?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.436
Just what are you
implying here?

21:54.440 --> 21:56.602
That my husband is
having an affair?

21:56.610 --> 21:58.009
Elaine, he's not
implying anything.

21:58.010 --> 22:01.173
Do you realize how
painful this is for my family?

22:01.180 --> 22:05.276
We have been fighting these
infidelity rumors for years.

22:05.290 --> 22:06.746
How many times do
I have to say it?

22:06.750 --> 22:10.414
My husband is not
a cheater.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.058
Are we done here?

22:14.430 --> 22:17.559
Yes. Thank you
for your time.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.804
I specifically said I
would do the talking.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.960
You saw her face
when I asked about alice.

22:27.980 --> 22:28.936
She knows her.

22:28.940 --> 22:30.101
You overstepped,
jack.

22:30.110 --> 22:31.271
She lied about
knowing alice,

22:31.280 --> 22:33.476
And she has
the perfect motive.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.504
Why would she
stalk her?

22:34.520 --> 22:36.943
Why wouldn't she just
pay alice to go away?

22:36.950 --> 22:39.385
Maybe she tried and
alice refused. Who knows?

22:39.390 --> 22:41.119
I'm gonna call ben and
give him a head's-up,

22:41.120 --> 22:43.851
See if he can find a connection
between elaine and alice.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.988
Thank you
for coming in.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.788
How are you doing?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.154
I'm ok.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.457
I moved in
with a friend

22:50.470 --> 22:52.666
While they clean up
my place.

22:52.670 --> 22:56.459
I need to ask you
about the mayor's wife.

22:56.470 --> 22:59.132
Did you know her?
Have you ever met?

22:59.140 --> 23:00.505
Not that I remember.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.535
I mean, that would be kind
of weird, don't you think?

23:02.540 --> 23:03.905
Has anyone ever
contacted you,

23:03.910 --> 23:05.969
Tried to get you
to end the relationship?

23:05.980 --> 23:07.573
We didn't really have
a relationship.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.514
We only met
a few times.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.820
We didn't even
have sex.

23:12.820 --> 23:13.981
You didn't?

23:13.990 --> 23:15.389
No. We just talked.

23:15.390 --> 23:16.858
A lot of rich men
just like to have

23:16.860 --> 23:19.659
A pretty girl around while they
drone on about their workday.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.856
The two of you just
talked about work?

23:21.860 --> 23:24.989
No. Mostly, we talked
about me,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.365
What I was doing.

23:26.370 --> 23:28.168
He wanted me to go
back to college.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.990
And he never touched you,

23:30.000 --> 23:30.933
Not even to kiss?

23:30.940 --> 23:33.363
Maybe a peck
on the cheek.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.338
He's a nice guy.

23:35.340 --> 23:39.174
Always left a big tip.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.579
I got something
for you.

23:40.580 --> 23:41.877
Before she died
last month,

23:41.880 --> 23:44.178
Alice's mom worked as a
school teacher for 20 years.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.339
Her only job
before that was

23:45.350 --> 23:48.615
As an aide to then city
councilman william ha yes.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.509
Elaine was his
speechwriter back then.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.352
Their paths
must have crossed.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.725
What happened
to alice's mom?

23:54.730 --> 23:57.097
She left abruptly in '93,
moved to orange county.

23:57.100 --> 24:00.070
Alice was born in '94,
and get this.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.367
When I spoke to alice,
she claims

24:01.370 --> 24:05.091
She and the mayor
never had sex, just talked.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.408
How long had alice
been seeing the mayor?

24:07.410 --> 24:08.366
Only a few weeks.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.530
So it began right after
the mother died.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.746
Which means that the
mayor did have an affair,

24:12.750 --> 24:14.946
Only it wasn't
with alice.

24:14.950 --> 24:17.647
It was
with her mother.

24:18.550 --> 24:21.611
Alice is
the mayor's daughter.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.479
[knock on door]

24:28.500 --> 24:30.992
You got a minute?

24:31.000 --> 24:34.026
Yeah. Have a seat.

24:34.730 --> 24:36.732
I was just notified
that perry made bail.

24:36.740 --> 24:39.801
They're processing
him right now.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.302
Malcolm whitely posted
bail for him.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.608
He happens to be very
good friends with judge bryan.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.248
He called on perry's
behalf and told him

24:46.250 --> 24:49.140
That he would put him in a
treatment center immediately

24:49.150 --> 24:51.346
In santa barbara.

24:51.350 --> 24:53.079
Money talks.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.819
Always.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.742
What happens now?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.159
We're gonna go to
the preliminary hearing,

24:57.160 --> 25:00.084
And he's gonna show that
he is receiving treatment.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.627
He is gonna leverage
a plea bargain.

25:02.630 --> 25:05.497
He's--he's gonna get
a slap on the wrist.

25:05.500 --> 25:09.937
The best that we can hope
for is misdemeanor probation.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.260
You got to be
kidding m--

25:11.270 --> 25:12.431
[knock on door]

25:12.440 --> 25:13.669
We need you.

25:13.670 --> 25:15.877
I'll be right there.

25:21.780 --> 25:24.169
I am so sorry.

25:26.290 --> 25:29.351
Thank you, amanda.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.452
Jack: The timeline matches.

25:30.460 --> 25:31.950
Alice's mother quit
working for the mayor

25:31.960 --> 25:34.452
Around the same time
the infidelity rumors started.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.451
Alice's birth certificate
doesn't list a father.

25:36.460 --> 25:39.020
So the mayor's not being
targeted over an affair?

25:39.030 --> 25:41.294
He's being targeted
because of his daughter.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.337
First, the stalker
lashes out in rage.

25:43.340 --> 25:45.638
Then he sends a warning.
When that doesn't work, he--

25:45.640 --> 25:46.801
Or she.

25:46.810 --> 25:48.665
Tries to scare alice,

25:48.680 --> 25:49.829
Break up
the relationship.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.229
The stalker has to be
someone close to the mayor.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.479
Otherwise, why
protect his secret?

25:53.480 --> 25:55.539
I told you. Always
goes back to the spouse.

25:55.550 --> 25:56.517
Well, we tried that.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.114
Let's talk
to the mayor again.

26:00.490 --> 26:02.310
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
You can't--

26:02.320 --> 26:03.810
You can't just
barge in here.

26:03.820 --> 26:04.981
We need to speak
to the mayor.

26:04.990 --> 26:06.549
Look. I just got off the
phone with elaine ha yes.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.825
She said you accused the
mayor of having an affair.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.753
No. That was me.

26:13.330 --> 26:14.422
What's going on?

26:14.440 --> 26:17.193
Will, we need
5 minutes.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.965
Please excuse us,
cedric.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.509
What do you want?

26:25.510 --> 26:28.480
Is alice vargas
your daughter?

26:30.280 --> 26:34.717
I think it's time
you told me the truth.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.382
Yes, she is.

26:37.390 --> 26:40.849
Her mother sandra,
she used to work for me.

26:40.860 --> 26:45.229
We had an affair
shortly after I got married.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.789
I'm not proud
of it.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.962
So the rumors
were true.

26:48.970 --> 26:50.768
I was young
and stupid.

26:50.770 --> 26:54.707
The scandal would have
derailed my political career.

26:54.710 --> 26:58.101
Sandra--she handled
it with such grace.

26:58.110 --> 26:59.703
She just quit her
job, she moved away.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.542
She didn't ask
me for anything.

27:01.550 --> 27:03.871
You didn't know she
was pregnant at the time.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.884
No. I didn't know
anything about alice

27:06.890 --> 27:11.714
Until sandra reached
out to me last month.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.289
I...

27:13.290 --> 27:18.899
I didn't know how sick
she was until the end.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.597
She had cancer.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.230
She, um, lost touch
with alice,

27:25.240 --> 27:26.935
And she asked me
to look out for her.

27:26.940 --> 27:29.261
I wanted to help, so
I tracked her down,

27:29.280 --> 27:32.079
And I pretended
to be a client

27:32.080 --> 27:33.502
To get close
to her.

27:33.510 --> 27:37.071
But you didn't tell
alice the truth.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.514
I wasn't sure how
she'd feel about me,

27:38.520 --> 27:40.841
Considering how I
treated her mother.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.989
That's a big
political risk.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.489
Heh. Elaine warned
me not to get involved,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.127
But I didn't listen.

27:50.130 --> 27:51.154
So your wife knew?

27:51.170 --> 27:54.094
She was concerned.
I'm running for governor.

27:54.100 --> 28:00.437
I mean, she's the
political savvy one.

28:00.440 --> 28:04.536
How upset was your wife
when she heard the news?

28:08.650 --> 28:10.470
What, you...

28:10.480 --> 28:13.188
You don't think
elaine's behind all this?

28:13.190 --> 28:15.750
We need to talk
to her.

28:26.070 --> 28:28.391
Honey, what is
going on?

28:28.400 --> 28:31.267
They know about alice.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.535
You were dishonest
with us, elaine.

28:34.540 --> 28:37.703
I kept a secret in order
to protect my husband.

28:37.710 --> 28:39.132
How far would
you go, elaine?

28:39.150 --> 28:40.709
Would you hire
someone to stalk him,

28:40.720 --> 28:43.143
To dress as a court
jester to scare him?

28:43.150 --> 28:46.586
That's an outrageous
accusation, detective.

28:46.590 --> 28:48.240
You're out of line.

28:48.260 --> 28:54.256
It's ok. I did it.
I confess.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.580
Elaine.

28:55.600 --> 29:00.162
I was just trying to stop
you from ruining your career

29:00.170 --> 29:02.491
You'd do anything
to protect your family,

29:02.500 --> 29:04.195
Wouldn't you,
mrs. Hayes?

29:04.210 --> 29:05.735
Of course.

29:05.740 --> 29:08.664
You kept your
husband's infidelity

29:08.680 --> 29:09.909
A secret
for 20 years.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.400
You denied rumors,
and you lied to the world,

29:11.410 --> 29:14.004
And now you're just gonna
roll over and confess?

29:14.010 --> 29:16.172
You came here
and accused me.

29:16.180 --> 29:17.409
I admitted it,
and now you're

29:17.420 --> 29:18.910
Accusing me
of lying

29:18.920 --> 29:20.684
About lying to you?

29:20.690 --> 29:22.010
Just seems to easy.

29:22.020 --> 29:25.752
Did you tell your
son about the affair?

29:27.060 --> 29:32.191
Craig? He knows
nothing about this.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.190
Is that true,
elaine,

29:34.200 --> 29:37.500
Or did you tell craig
about the affair?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.306
We are
a political family.

29:41.310 --> 29:44.940
We keep our
dirty laundry in house,

29:44.950 --> 29:49.615
And when I found out that
you and sandra had a daughter,

29:49.620 --> 29:52.078
I was heartbroken.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.787
I couldn't talk
to anyone.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.254
So you turned
to craig.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.580
He's always been
there for me,

29:59.590 --> 30:02.230
But I had no idea
how upset he'd be,

30:02.230 --> 30:04.392
And when you showed
me that photo of the mask,

30:04.400 --> 30:06.391
I recognized
his work immediately.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.061
Craig was so upset
by your betrayal.

30:08.070 --> 30:10.732
That's why he went
after you and alice.

30:10.740 --> 30:13.232
He has always felt
slighted by his father,

30:13.240 --> 30:16.574
But he would never
hurt anyone.

30:16.580 --> 30:19.072
Where is your son
right now?

30:19.080 --> 30:20.878
I...

30:22.280 --> 30:25.648
[music playing]

30:32.460 --> 30:33.950
Are you craig?

30:33.960 --> 30:36.952
I'm alice.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.099
Please come in.

30:40.470 --> 30:43.337
I like to get the money
out of the way first.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.160
Oh.

30:47.710 --> 30:50.577
Oh. You can place it
on the table.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.769
Don't worry.
We're gonna have fun.

30:55.780 --> 30:58.977
Ahem. Do you want
a beer?

30:58.990 --> 31:02.016
Some water
would be great.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.890
What do you do?

31:10.900 --> 31:16.794
I do concept art
for makeup effects.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.894
Where do you work?

31:18.910 --> 31:19.729
I don't.

31:19.740 --> 31:22.903
I'm a student,
film school,

31:22.910 --> 31:25.971
Or I was.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.539
I took a year off.

31:27.550 --> 31:30.178
Well, you're
very talented

31:30.180 --> 31:33.184
And a little disturbed.

31:33.190 --> 31:35.045
Heh.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.386
It's just the two
of us here, right?

31:43.930 --> 31:46.820
There's something we
need to talk about, alice.

31:46.830 --> 31:50.391
Sure. It's your night.

31:54.870 --> 31:57.237
I wanted to talk
about my dad.

31:57.240 --> 32:02.770
Go for it. I'm great
with daddy issues.

32:02.780 --> 32:04.919
Well...

32:04.920 --> 32:06.888
I've been angry
at him.

32:06.890 --> 32:09.348
He never even tried
with me, you know,

32:09.360 --> 32:11.510
Just ignored me.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.249
He has no idea
I even draw,

32:14.260 --> 32:16.695
Much less make these.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.429
All he knows is I
dropped out of college

32:18.430 --> 32:20.728
And he was done
with me.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.631
I've just been
so angry at him.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.631
Parents.
We hate them

32:25.640 --> 32:29.361
When we really only
want their approval.

32:29.880 --> 32:33.077
That's why
you're here.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.741
I don't follow.

32:34.750 --> 32:37.219
Well, I'm done
trying to hurt him.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.369
I don't want to anymore.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.644
I just want to stop
all this anger.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.550
I thought if we got
to know each other--

32:44.560 --> 32:49.623
I thought we could talk
the way my dad talks to you.

32:49.630 --> 32:52.497
Who is your dad?

32:52.500 --> 32:54.969
He's your dad, too.

32:56.840 --> 32:59.935
Mayor ha yes.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.068
What?

33:02.080 --> 33:05.471
First, I thought
you knew.

33:09.450 --> 33:11.578
I-I-I was hurt,
I wanted to scare you.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.080
That's all.

33:13.090 --> 33:14.979
I'm sorry
about your apartment.

33:14.990 --> 33:18.915
No. Wait. Don't--
don't go--ohh!

33:18.930 --> 33:20.580
Ohh. Unh.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.525
[whimpering]

33:25.530 --> 33:26.429
Come on.

33:26.430 --> 33:27.795
[elevator motor whirring]

33:27.800 --> 33:29.837
Come on.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.931
Drew?

33:32.940 --> 33:34.499
Hello, alice.

33:34.510 --> 33:35.966
Unh! Gah!

33:35.980 --> 33:37.106
Craig: Hey!

33:37.110 --> 33:38.509
Aah! Aah!

33:38.510 --> 33:40.342
Unh!

33:42.450 --> 33:44.612
Aah! Ohh!

33:44.620 --> 33:46.509
Aah!

33:56.660 --> 33:58.992
Nice.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.128
Scary. You punk!

34:01.140 --> 34:04.690
Following your daddy
around like some kind

34:04.710 --> 34:07.202
Of wimpy baby.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.170
[craig groans]

34:11.179 --> 34:12.329
I'm gonna take
care of him,

34:12.350 --> 34:14.808
And then we're gonna be
ok, we're gonna be together.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.344
All right?

34:16.350 --> 34:18.011
Do not scream.

34:18.020 --> 34:20.239
Do you understand?

34:29.560 --> 34:32.427
Please don't
do this, drew.

34:32.429 --> 34:35.070
Why did you call
the police?

34:35.070 --> 34:36.697
You ruined
everything.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.829
I mean, don't you know
how much I love you?

34:39.840 --> 34:40.909
I-I do know.

34:40.909 --> 34:43.708
But why do you
ignore me? Why?

34:43.710 --> 34:48.500
Why do you have to go
tell the cops about me?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.670
I thought
it was you.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.342
But I'm not gonna
wear a mask

34:53.350 --> 34:55.284
And run around
and scare you

34:55.290 --> 34:58.590
Like--like--like
some kid.

35:00.290 --> 35:01.553
Are you ok?
Listen.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.530
You just need to
run. You need to go.

35:04.530 --> 35:05.850
Run!

35:05.870 --> 35:09.261
[both grunting]

35:16.880 --> 35:19.303
[grunting continues]

35:19.310 --> 35:20.300
Aah! Ohh!

35:20.310 --> 35:22.369
[grunting stops]

35:22.380 --> 35:24.178
Ugh!

35:30.390 --> 35:31.880
Don't run from me.

35:31.890 --> 35:34.530
Gah!
Alice!

35:45.400 --> 35:48.631
Aah! Help!

35:54.080 --> 35:56.174
Beth: This is it.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.159
Whoa! Whoa, whoa

36:08.160 --> 36:09.286
Where's alice?
Is she here?

36:09.300 --> 36:11.792
She just took off. The
crazy guy is chasing her.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.824
What crazy guy?

36:12.830 --> 36:14.093
Alice called him
drew.

36:14.100 --> 36:14.965
Drew summers?

36:14.970 --> 36:16.768
I don't know. I
think they're going

36:16.770 --> 36:18.761
Towards the bridge.

36:18.770 --> 36:20.864
This is lieutenant davis.
We're on foot pursuit,

36:20.870 --> 36:23.009
Headed toward 6th street,
eastbound.

36:23.010 --> 36:25.377
We need a perimeter
set up.

36:27.650 --> 36:29.948
[screaming]

36:29.950 --> 36:32.840
Please don't!

36:32.850 --> 36:35.182
Aah!

36:35.190 --> 36:37.113
Aah!

36:37.120 --> 36:40.954
[whimpering]

36:40.960 --> 36:45.056
No! No! Please.
Please.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.061
Noooo! Please.

36:47.070 --> 36:49.220
Why don't you
love me? Why?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.493
I can. I d--I do.
I love you.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.138
I love--I love you,
drew.

36:54.140 --> 36:56.336
[sobbing]

36:56.340 --> 36:58.479
You're a liar.
Liar.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.800
Please. No!

36:59.810 --> 37:01.699
Liar!
Aah!

37:01.720 --> 37:03.540
Unh!

37:06.490 --> 37:07.582
Don't!

37:07.590 --> 37:09.843
[alice sobbing]

37:09.860 --> 37:12.750
[sirens]

37:18.060 --> 37:21.428
[music playing]

38:28.900 --> 38:30.766
Perry's missing.

38:30.770 --> 38:32.499
He didn't show up
at the hospital.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.160
He withdrew from
alcott university.

38:34.170 --> 38:35.433
We checked
his dorm room.

38:35.440 --> 38:38.080
It's been
cleared out.

38:41.310 --> 38:43.642
Is his family involved?

38:43.650 --> 38:45.914
His father's the one
who contacted us.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.685
He ditched his family once
he got back to santa barbara.

38:48.690 --> 38:51.489
They don't know
where he is.

38:52.930 --> 38:56.821
A bolo has been issued
in 3 counties.

38:58.600 --> 39:03.094
We will find him,
I promise.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.159
Thank you, janice.

39:08.940 --> 39:12.331
[music playing]

39:17.880 --> 39:19.769
I hear you had
quite a day.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.781
Phew. Double-header.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.349
One mayor,
two stalkers.

39:23.360 --> 39:27.479
Don't look at me.
I didn't vote for him.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.525
You heading home?

39:28.530 --> 39:31.556
Yeah.
In a little bit.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.799
How's ethan?

39:32.800 --> 39:34.495
He's good.
He enjoyed spending

39:34.500 --> 39:36.889
Time with you, jack.

39:36.900 --> 39:37.970
Same here.

39:37.970 --> 39:40.564
Maybe we can
do it again.

39:45.980 --> 39:50.315
Ethan was hoping to see
you this weekend if you're free.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.379
I'd like that.

39:53.650 --> 39:54.981
Very much.

39:54.990 --> 39:59.018
I'll tell him.
Good night, jack.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.421

40:11.170 --> 40:13.298
[buzzer]

40:36.930 --> 40:39.456
Beth?

40:39.470 --> 40:41.768
What's going on?

40:47.810 --> 40:50.780
Thanks for agreeing
to see me.

40:52.710 --> 40:55.145
What do you want?

40:55.150 --> 40:57.847
Tell me.

40:59.050 --> 41:01.144
I want to help.

41:04.060 --> 41:05.880
Ok.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.654
We have
a mutual friend.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.129
Oh?

41:13.130 --> 41:15.224
Michelle webber.

41:16.670 --> 41:18.490
Michelle.

41:19.810 --> 41:20.936
How is my girl?
