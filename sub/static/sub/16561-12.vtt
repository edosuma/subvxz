WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:03.135
I believe

00:03.172 --> 00:05.705
"in nothing do men
more nearly approach the gods.

00:05.740 --> 00:08.709
Than in giving health to men."

00:08.744 --> 00:13.146
It's so humbling,
the responsibility.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.715
What's with the camera?

00:14.750 --> 00:16.416
They're shooting...
The promo today.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.550
Yup.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.286
A star is born.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.288
Maggie? Yeah.

00:21.323 --> 00:22.823
This is jason dodd. 26.

00:22.858 --> 00:24.157
Heart's racing pretty good.

00:24.193 --> 00:26.226
Dr. Halstead, you're up. April!

00:26.261 --> 00:29.128
He was lugging the crib out
of ikea and he just collapsed.

00:29.164 --> 00:30.241
All right,
you'll go to treatment 2.

00:30.265 --> 00:31.464
Hi, jason. I'm dr. Halstead.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.598
How are you feeling?

00:32.634 --> 00:34.066
Kind of freaked out.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.246
All right, we're gonna
take good care of you.

00:35.270 --> 00:36.602
He's really tachy. Might be svt.

00:36.639 --> 00:38.070
Copy.

00:38.106 --> 00:40.473
Okay, we're gonna have you
lie down, okay?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.075
Ready
six milligrams of adenosine.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.075
And get him up on the monitors.

00:43.111 --> 00:43.843
Got it.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.344
Jason, you on any medications?

00:45.380 --> 00:46.445
No. Any history.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.747
We should be aware of? No.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.093
All right, jason.
I don't need to tell you.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.316
That your heart is racing.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.317
What we're gonna do
is give you a drug.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.319
To reset your rhythm.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.319
Reset?

00:53.354 --> 00:54.765
Your heart, it's gonna
pause for a few seconds.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.188
Wait a minute, what?

00:56.224 --> 00:57.857
It'll be all right.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.458
Let's give
the doctors some room.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.494
Get a flush, 10ccs.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.096
Hold up.
What's with the monitors, april?

01:04.132 --> 01:07.633
It's upside down.
Leads must be reversed.

01:07.669 --> 01:09.269
No...

01:09.303 --> 01:11.270
They're fine.

01:15.511 --> 01:18.345
Just breathe, jason.

01:18.380 --> 01:19.613
This is strange.

01:19.648 --> 01:21.348
It's like everything's
on the wrong side.

01:21.383 --> 01:22.616
Let's get a chest x-ray.

01:22.651 --> 01:24.885
What appears to be
the problem here?

01:24.919 --> 01:26.620
There appears to be
some irregularities.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.721
With the patient's heart.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.723
What kind of irregularities?

01:29.758 --> 01:31.624
It's not where
it's supposed to be.

01:31.660 --> 01:33.193
Basic anatomy is usually covered.

01:33.228 --> 01:36.630
In the first year of
med school, dr. Halstead.

01:36.665 --> 01:38.331
I think he might
be dextrocardic.

01:38.367 --> 01:39.733
I'm about to get a chest x-ray.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.201
Let's wait on that.

01:41.236 --> 01:42.469
Push the meds.

01:42.504 --> 01:43.803
Listen up, people.

01:43.839 --> 01:45.205
We're tight on space, so...

01:45.240 --> 01:46.350
If you're not
doing anything useful,

01:46.374 --> 01:49.342
Just take a giant step back.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.922 --> 02:01.654
Heart rate's 120.

02:01.690 --> 02:06.492
Bp's ticking up... 100 over 87.

02:06.528 --> 02:07.593
What just happened?

02:07.629 --> 02:09.195
We just saved your life.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.596
Let's get that picture now.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.200
And, page ct.

02:14.236 --> 02:17.536
I guess cicero knew what he was
talking about after all.

02:24.452 --> 02:25.686
Why's this backwards?

02:25.721 --> 02:26.820
It's not.

02:26.856 --> 02:29.590
He's got situs inversus totalis.

02:29.625 --> 02:31.291
All his major visceral organs...

02:31.327 --> 02:33.827
Are reversed from their normal
position inside of his body.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.596
More like
a mirror image, but yeah.

02:35.631 --> 02:36.830
So wild.

02:36.866 --> 02:39.166
How often do you see
someone with this?

02:39.201 --> 02:40.601
Never.

02:40.636 --> 02:42.469
Jason, becca...
This is dr. Rhodes.

02:42.505 --> 02:44.304
Hi, I'm down from
cardiothoracic surgery.

02:44.340 --> 02:46.180
I'm gonna accompany you
over to run some tests.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.453
See if we can't figure out what
caused your heart rate to spike.

02:48.477 --> 02:51.845
Okay.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.313
Shame he wouldn't
sign the release.

02:53.349 --> 02:54.826
I wanted to shoot
the scan room in action.

02:54.850 --> 02:56.450
That's the thing about the e.D.

02:56.485 --> 02:58.719
Another story's
just a heartbeat away.

02:58.754 --> 03:01.522
Can you say that
again on camera?

03:01.557 --> 03:03.490
Yes, that'll be better.

03:03.526 --> 03:05.159
Ms. Goodwin,
if you have a second...

03:05.194 --> 03:07.694
You know, dr. Halstead,
there was a meeting last week,

03:07.730 --> 03:11.165
Open to anyone who had
concerns about the video.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.699
I don't recall seeing you there.

03:12.735 --> 03:14.168
I was not there, but...

03:14.203 --> 03:15.702
Dr. Stohl has assured me.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.471
That the camera
won't get in the way.

03:17.506 --> 03:19.473
Of us treating our patients,

03:19.508 --> 03:20.574
If that's your worry.

03:20.609 --> 03:22.476
That's one of them, yeah.

03:22.511 --> 03:25.345
I'm gonna tell you,
I'm proud of this e.D.

03:25.381 --> 03:28.582
I've assembled
the finest staff in the city,

03:28.617 --> 03:32.319
And if even one patient
decides to come here.

03:32.354 --> 03:35.556
Because they saw
this video on our website,

03:35.591 --> 03:37.324
Then I think it's well worth it.

03:37.359 --> 03:38.325
Don't you?

03:38.360 --> 03:39.560
Dr. Halstead?

03:39.595 --> 03:41.562
Come round with me.

03:41.597 --> 03:46.700
Carry on.

03:46.735 --> 03:48.869
Not the most
cooperative intake ever.

03:48.904 --> 03:50.571
The woman in treatment 6?

03:50.606 --> 03:51.705
Yeah, laura green.

03:51.740 --> 03:52.873
Age 39.

03:52.908 --> 03:53.774
Mvc.

03:53.809 --> 03:57.010
5 cm laceration on
her left upper forehead.

03:57.046 --> 03:59.546
Gs 15, no loc. Vitals stable.

03:59.582 --> 04:01.381
Um... Blood and personality,

04:01.417 --> 04:02.683
Both type a.

04:02.718 --> 04:03.718
I'll take it from here.

04:03.752 --> 04:06.887
Thank you, jeff. Sure.

04:06.922 --> 04:08.722
So it's really over
between you two?

04:08.757 --> 04:10.457
Why?

04:10.493 --> 04:11.959
Just impressed.

04:11.994 --> 04:15.429
Personally, I could
never work alongside an ex.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.731
Too much boil and bubble.

04:17.766 --> 04:18.877
Jeff and I were good friends.

04:18.901 --> 04:20.567
Before anything
happened between us.

04:20.603 --> 04:23.570
Guess it makes it easier
to find that equilibrium again.

04:23.606 --> 04:25.873
Good for you.

04:25.908 --> 04:27.307
No, no, no.

04:27.343 --> 04:29.309
We're not waiving
the contingencies, no.

04:29.345 --> 04:30.744
Let me call you right back.

04:30.779 --> 04:32.446
I got another doctor in here.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.981
Hi, ms. Green. I'm dr. Manning.

04:34.016 --> 04:35.315
Can you tell me what happened?

04:35.351 --> 04:36.583
I hit a patch of black ice.

04:36.619 --> 04:37.584
Driving too fast.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.586
My daughter had
another meltdown at school.

04:39.622 --> 04:41.889
Got pulled out of a meeting
to go pick her up...

04:41.924 --> 04:42.990
Again.

04:43.025 --> 04:44.458
Hello, what's your name?

04:44.493 --> 04:46.326
Ariel. A girl
who has zero appreciation.

04:46.362 --> 04:48.595
For what it's like
to be in her mother's shoes.

04:48.631 --> 04:50.564
No wonder I have an ulcer.
An ulcer?

04:50.599 --> 04:51.639
Nothing tums can't manage.

04:51.667 --> 04:52.811
Look, can we make this quick?

04:52.835 --> 04:54.334
I am super deep
in the weeds today.

04:54.370 --> 04:56.069
Sure. Let me take a look.

04:56.105 --> 04:59.306
Sorry.

05:04.947 --> 05:07.347
Okay.

05:07.383 --> 05:08.615
You okay, ariel?

05:08.651 --> 05:10.350
Did you get hurt
in the crash, too?

05:10.386 --> 05:11.930
She's been complaining
like this for months.

05:11.954 --> 05:13.832
I've taken her to every
gi specialist in the city.

05:13.856 --> 05:14.755
At considerable expense.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.790
No one could find
anything wrong with her.

05:16.825 --> 05:18.792
It's not my stomach
this time, mom,

05:18.827 --> 05:20.794
It's my head. It's throbbing.

05:20.829 --> 05:22.029
And now she's got a headache.

05:22.064 --> 05:23.497
I think she's
trying to imitate me.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.033
Some juvenile attempt
to mock her mother.

05:26.068 --> 05:27.501
Okay, laura.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.503
I would like plastics
to come down and sew you up.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.049
So you get the best
cosmetic result, okay?

05:31.073 --> 05:32.806
But I-i really do
have to get back to work.

05:32.841 --> 05:35.375
I will try my best
to expedite things,

05:35.411 --> 05:36.643
But since you're already here,

05:36.679 --> 05:38.056
Perhaps I can take a look
at your daughter?

05:38.080 --> 05:39.513
Yeah... Yeah, that's fine.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.048
Okay.

05:41.083 --> 05:43.817
C.J.? Sorry. Where were we?

05:43.852 --> 05:45.852
I'm not just making this up.

05:53.495 --> 05:54.995
I get it.

05:55.030 --> 05:56.997
You're creating a vacuum.

05:57.032 --> 06:01.001
I... i read about this
somewhere. I...

06:01.036 --> 06:02.369
I don't know, I'm...

06:02.404 --> 06:05.639
I really felt compelled
to say something.

06:05.674 --> 06:08.508
Remind me again
why you're here, sarah.

06:08.544 --> 06:10.877
Dr. Charles said
undergoing therapy.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.880
Would help me become
a better psychiatrist.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.850
And thus far,
I'd have to say he's right.

06:16.885 --> 06:18.485
I'm learning so much.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.153
I hate to
break this to you, sarah,

06:20.189 --> 06:22.489
But what you're doing here now.

06:22.524 --> 06:25.158
Is not undergoing therapy.

06:25.194 --> 06:26.860
It's not?

06:26.895 --> 06:31.498
It feels more like
you're auditing a class.

06:31.533 --> 06:36.503
Come here.

06:36.538 --> 06:43.043
Come on.

06:43.078 --> 06:45.045
Look.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.882
What do you see?

06:48.917 --> 06:51.518
Um...

06:51.553 --> 06:53.887
Do you feel self-conscious?

06:53.922 --> 06:55.889
A little. Good.

06:55.924 --> 06:58.525
Self-conscious is
what we're going for.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.894
You know what makes you
better at this job?

07:00.929 --> 07:02.529
Being present.

07:02.564 --> 07:03.897
Being honest.

07:03.932 --> 07:06.533
Especially with yourself.

07:06.568 --> 07:07.768
Try it.

07:07.803 --> 07:11.038
First thought, best thought.

07:11.073 --> 07:13.740
Um...

07:13.776 --> 07:16.143
Yeah, I-i-i...
I don't know what to...

07:16.178 --> 07:17.744
What to tell you.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.646
I mean, I've led
such a mundane life.

07:19.682 --> 07:21.782
My... my problems
feel so pedestrian.

07:21.817 --> 07:22.916
Problems.

07:22.951 --> 07:25.085
That's a great start.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.220
Here.

07:27.256 --> 07:29.456
Okay.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.164
Hour's up at ten of, right?

07:37.199 --> 07:39.466
Normally.

07:39.501 --> 07:43.003
Well, then, same time next week?

07:43.038 --> 07:49.609
You know where to find me.

07:49.645 --> 07:51.912
So, given the patient's age,

07:51.947 --> 07:54.781
I was thinking a woven graft
with a mechanical valve.

07:54.817 --> 07:56.616
And once we adjust
for the inversa,

07:56.652 --> 07:58.919
It should be
a simple plug and play.

07:58.954 --> 07:59.886
Simple?

07:59.922 --> 08:01.955
Yeah, I was saying to
dr. Bardovi earlier,

08:01.990 --> 08:03.802
Once you situate your brain
in the right way...

08:03.826 --> 08:05.525
You were talking to dr. Bardovi.

08:05.561 --> 08:08.028
About the way
I situate my brain?

08:08.063 --> 08:09.029
What?

08:09.064 --> 08:11.665
<i>You said the way
you situate your brain.</i>

08:11.700 --> 08:14.668
No, I meant it more,
like, "once one situates..."

08:14.703 --> 08:16.136
I think you're underestimating.

08:16.171 --> 08:17.204
The challenges here...

08:17.239 --> 08:19.206
Severely.

08:19.241 --> 08:21.174
You may be right.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.644
Um, in that case,
I have a suggestion.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.647
How about we put the team
through a dress rehearsal?

08:27.683 --> 08:28.782
A rehearsal?

08:28.817 --> 08:31.952
I'll have a tech print us
a 3-d model of this heart,

08:31.987 --> 08:34.054
And that should give us
a very clear idea.

08:34.089 --> 08:36.655
Of how we'll proceed.

08:36.692 --> 08:37.936
If you think
it'll be worthwhile.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.828
Yeah, I think it'll be good
for everyone to walk through it.

08:43.866 --> 08:45.065
Keep your hands off me.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.633
Hey.

08:46.668 --> 08:47.979
We're trying to help.
We just wanna take a look, okay?

08:48.003 --> 08:49.536
What do we have here?

08:49.571 --> 08:50.615
Dr. Choi, this is rey ochoa,

08:50.639 --> 08:53.874
Who insisted there is
nothing at all wrong with him.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.175
That's weird.

08:55.210 --> 08:56.855
Charge nurse said
he was found doubled over.

08:56.879 --> 08:58.645
On the floor of
a gas station bathroom,

08:58.680 --> 08:59.746
Screaming out in pain.

08:59.782 --> 09:01.648
I wasn't screaming in pain.

09:01.683 --> 09:04.151
Only gay ass punks do that.

09:04.186 --> 09:06.253
Rey, you might not be aware,

09:06.288 --> 09:09.156
But I'm a navy flight surgeon,
still in active reserve.

09:09.191 --> 09:12.025
And, jeff, here
was an army ranger.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.594
Seen plenty of men
screaming out in pain.

09:14.630 --> 09:15.595
Tougher guys than me.

09:15.631 --> 09:16.596
So...

09:16.632 --> 09:17.864
How about we take a look?

09:17.900 --> 09:20.033
How about you suck me?

09:22.938 --> 09:24.671
Rey... Come on.

09:28.377 --> 09:30.677
Seen this movie before.

09:30.712 --> 09:33.346
Even when he says he has
something lodged up his rectum.

09:33.382 --> 09:34.915
Seriously?

09:34.950 --> 09:36.361
See how he's hunched up
on the gurney,

09:36.385 --> 09:38.685
Trying to take the pressure
off the rear end?

09:38.720 --> 09:40.220
Plus all the lip.

09:40.255 --> 09:42.923
The embarrassment
makes them combative.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.291
All right.

09:44.326 --> 09:45.759
I'll try to get an x-ray.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.627
Thanks.

09:47.663 --> 09:50.197
Mr. Mikulski's here with
a fever and some sinus pain.

09:50.232 --> 09:53.066
Really bad sinus pain, just fyi.

09:53.101 --> 09:54.201
Diabetic?

09:54.236 --> 09:55.202
How's his glucose?

09:55.237 --> 09:56.636
Totally normal.

09:56.672 --> 09:57.816
They said something
in the waiting area.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.372
About signing
some kind of release.

09:59.408 --> 10:00.907
Not necessary, mr. Mikulski.

10:00.943 --> 10:03.210
We'd like to send you
on your way asap.

10:03.245 --> 10:05.212
Let's get him on a z-pack.

10:05.247 --> 10:07.914
Sorry, one second.

10:07.950 --> 10:10.217
You see the swelling?

10:10.252 --> 10:11.585
Under the orbit of his left eye?

10:12.855 --> 10:14.721
It's practically
imperceptible, but...

10:14.756 --> 10:16.389
I think we should get a...

10:16.425 --> 10:18.825
A head and sinus ct,
just to rule out.

10:18.861 --> 10:20.260
Anything more concerning.

10:20.295 --> 10:23.263
Fever plus sinus pain
equals sinus infection.

10:23.298 --> 10:25.799
Let's z-pack and get you home.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.235
Check back in two days
if your symptoms persist.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.336
Hey, I really feel like...

10:29.371 --> 10:31.938
No, I'd... he's discharged.

10:31.974 --> 10:33.940
Let's find you
something more compelling.

10:33.976 --> 10:40.313
Let's go.

10:40.349 --> 10:43.083
Hey, mags, let's get
a cbc here on mr. Mikulski.

10:43.118 --> 10:45.096
And, don't let him leave
until the results come back.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.153
Go maverick.

10:53.996 --> 10:57.664
Mr. Clarke,
what are we looking at?

10:57.699 --> 10:59.132
Mr. Clarke?

10:59.167 --> 11:00.700
Sorry, we have a safety issue.

11:00.736 --> 11:01.701
Everybody please step out.

11:01.737 --> 11:02.636
Step out. Okay, thank you.

11:02.671 --> 11:04.371
Step out.
Laura, hey, laura, that's you?

11:04.406 --> 11:05.772
Security, over here.

11:05.807 --> 11:07.841
What's going on?

11:07.876 --> 11:09.376
Dr. Choi was right.

11:09.411 --> 11:12.379
There is something
lodged in the rectum.

11:12.414 --> 11:15.749
What is that, a gun?

11:21.290 --> 11:24.124
He says he has no idea
how the gun got up there.Nt.

11:24.159 --> 11:26.693
All right, what are our options?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.139
It's not gonna be
easy getting it out.

11:28.163 --> 11:29.996
It's just past his sphincter.

11:30.032 --> 11:31.598
Plus, the hammer's cocked.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.199
So if there's
a live round in there...

11:33.235 --> 11:34.267
Seriously?

11:34.303 --> 11:35.702
Could do some real damage.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.837
.22 single-shot derringer.

11:37.873 --> 11:40.607
That's a big kick
for a little gun.

11:40.642 --> 11:43.610
So we work up a plan
to get him to the o.R.

11:43.645 --> 11:45.011
Page the surgeon on call.

11:45.047 --> 11:47.981
Ms. Goodwin, I think
it'd be safer to do it here.

11:48.016 --> 11:49.849
Jeff and I both have
weapons experience.

11:49.885 --> 11:51.685
We sedate him.
Try to slide it out.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.853
If we can't make it,
then we call in surgery.

11:53.889 --> 11:55.121
I'm in.

11:55.157 --> 11:56.523
Should we call c.P.D?

11:56.558 --> 11:58.658
Yes. We'll need
enough body armor and gear.

11:58.694 --> 12:00.327
To protect whoever's
in there with him.

12:00.362 --> 12:02.896
And let's keep this area clear.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.665
And I'll keep the cameraman
away from all this.

12:05.701 --> 12:07.200
It's unsafe, and frankly,

12:07.235 --> 12:09.035
It's distasteful.

12:09.071 --> 12:11.338
Thank you.

12:11.373 --> 12:14.040
The second you focus on
one pain, it disappears,

12:14.076 --> 12:16.209
Or shifts
someplace else entirely.

12:16.244 --> 12:18.678
First it was her stomach,
then her forehead.

12:18.714 --> 12:21.214
We move her into another room
and now it's her sinuses.

12:21.249 --> 12:23.817
Tricky hitting a moving target.

12:23.852 --> 12:25.218
And listen, I am predisposed.

12:25.253 --> 12:27.687
To side with anyone
against the mother,

12:27.723 --> 12:29.889
But I don't know that
she's wrong about her daughter.

12:29.925 --> 12:31.324
You think
she might be faking it?

12:31.360 --> 12:32.759
I had her record sent over,

12:32.794 --> 12:33.860
And amongst other things,

12:33.895 --> 12:36.763
She's been worked up for
achalasia, abdominal migraine,

12:36.798 --> 12:39.065
Cyclic vomiting syndrome.
All negative.

12:39.101 --> 12:42.068
It does not appear to be
anything physiological.

12:42.104 --> 12:43.770
Why don't I have a little chat?

12:43.805 --> 12:47.340
I would appreciate that,
thank you.

12:47.376 --> 12:48.675
What's up with the limp?

12:48.710 --> 12:49.676
Rehab.

12:49.711 --> 12:52.078
My physio's got me doing
these swiss ball squats.

12:52.114 --> 12:54.347
It's freaking brutal.

12:54.383 --> 12:56.383
Cbc's back
on your sinus infection.

12:56.418 --> 12:58.251
You were right.

12:58.286 --> 12:59.853
White count's elevated.

12:59.888 --> 13:01.388
Not sure it's elevated enough.

13:01.423 --> 13:05.925
To change stohl's mind, though.

13:05.961 --> 13:08.695
Hand me one of those video
release forms, will you?

13:08.730 --> 13:10.930
For a guy always
complaining about money,

13:10.966 --> 13:14.334
You sure put your job
on the line a lot.

13:17.239 --> 13:20.774
My mom keeps saying I'm doing
this for attention, but...

13:20.809 --> 13:23.209
God, who likes seeing doctors?

13:23.245 --> 13:25.211
Your leg okay?

13:25.247 --> 13:27.113
All of a sudden, my knee hurts.

13:28.183 --> 13:31.284
This place freaks me out
even worse than school.

13:31.319 --> 13:34.287
What freaks you out
about school?

13:34.322 --> 13:36.756
Everything.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.758
There's so much drama.

13:38.794 --> 13:41.127
It makes me crazy anxious.

13:41.163 --> 13:43.897
Sometimes I hide,
sometimes I get into fights.

13:43.932 --> 13:45.865
That's what happened today?

13:50.005 --> 13:53.173
I looked up
schizophrenia online.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.308
It says it can start
in late adolescence.

13:55.343 --> 13:59.679
Not usually
as early as 14, but...

13:59.714 --> 14:02.348
I mean, are you
hearing or seeing things.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.817
That other people aren't?

14:03.852 --> 14:05.118
No.

14:05.153 --> 14:06.820
But...

14:06.855 --> 14:09.989
Sometimes, it's like...

14:10.025 --> 14:12.992
My feelings aren't my own.

14:13.028 --> 14:14.994
Like they're someone else's.

14:16.865 --> 14:18.264
Do you think I'm crazy?

14:18.300 --> 14:20.266
Not really my favorite word,

14:20.302 --> 14:22.235
But no, no, I don't.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.041
Thank you.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.677
Let's get you what you need.

14:30.712 --> 14:32.679
Excuse me, dr. Stohl?

14:32.714 --> 14:34.481
About ed mikulski, in room 4.

14:34.516 --> 14:36.049
I thought
I already discharged him.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.495
But that was before
his blood work came back.

14:37.519 --> 14:39.185
With a white count of 18,000.

14:39.221 --> 14:40.498
I just wanted
your approval before

14:40.522 --> 14:42.822
I send him over for scans.

14:42.858 --> 14:45.058
He was willing
to sign a video waiver,

14:45.093 --> 14:47.060
By the way, if that matters.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.195
Well, we haven't
found anybody to follow yet,

14:49.231 --> 14:51.965
And I did want to film
the scanning facility.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.501
Plus dr. Halstead
here pops on camera.

14:54.536 --> 14:57.136
Must be the red hair.

14:57.172 --> 14:58.872
All right, send him over.

14:58.907 --> 15:00.006
Wait a second, will you?

15:00.041 --> 15:01.241
We gotta swap out a battery.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.242
Sure thing.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.245
Dr. Halstead?

15:05.280 --> 15:08.014
You wouldn't be trying to
show me up on camera, would you?

15:08.049 --> 15:11.017
What?

15:11.052 --> 15:16.823
Never mind.

15:16.858 --> 15:18.491
I'll begin by placing
the venus cannula.

15:18.527 --> 15:20.493
In the right atrium.

15:20.529 --> 15:23.229
I'm sorry, sir, but...

15:23.265 --> 15:25.243
In this case, it's actually
the one that's on the left.

15:25.267 --> 15:28.501
We have to remember that
everything here is mirrored.

15:30.539 --> 15:32.939
I am not
in a good position for this.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.374
Okay.

15:34.409 --> 15:38.511
Let's switch sides, then.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.955
Atrial purse string suture.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.034
Where am I supposed to be now?

15:50.058 --> 15:51.424
To my left.

15:51.459 --> 15:53.026
But then
I'll be out of the field.

15:53.061 --> 15:55.028
I can't move, guys,
so don't look at me.

15:55.063 --> 15:56.796
Am I okay, here?
Am I in the right spot?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.309
Yeah, you're fine.
Where's that suture?

15:58.333 --> 16:00.433
I don't wanna
reach over the patient.

16:00.468 --> 16:03.436
Beth, why don't you
just go stand on his right?

16:03.471 --> 16:06.940
You two, switch.

16:06.975 --> 16:08.441
This is why we're here,
right, folks?

16:08.476 --> 16:11.077
We're just trying
to work out the kinks.

16:11.112 --> 16:12.779
I have to reach across my body.

16:12.814 --> 16:13.713
This is all wasted motion.

16:13.748 --> 16:15.226
Um, but there's
nowhere else I can stand.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.784
I am sick and tired
of being mocked!

16:17.819 --> 16:20.353
I will not
abide insubordination.

16:24.993 --> 16:28.127
I have put up with
that ingrate for seven years.

16:28.163 --> 16:29.963
No more.
Beth, he's gonna calm down.

16:29.998 --> 16:31.230
I'm done!

16:42.143 --> 16:43.977
Ethan? Yeah.

16:44.012 --> 16:44.844
I thought we had a policy.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.513
About dealing with
polyembolokoilamania?

16:47.549 --> 16:48.581
I'm sorry?

16:48.617 --> 16:51.417
The insertion of a foreign
object into an orifice.

16:51.453 --> 16:54.153
All patients are supposed to be
psychiatrically evaluated.

16:54.189 --> 16:55.633
We've got a bit of
a mitigating circumstance.

16:55.657 --> 16:56.923
Here, reese.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.325
The gun. Exactly.
To do what he did,

16:59.361 --> 17:01.094
This kid must be
seriously troubled,

17:01.129 --> 17:03.329
And now, he's
alone and terrified.

17:03.365 --> 17:05.198
Are the restraints
really necessary?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.099
For the safety of everyone, yes.

17:07.135 --> 17:10.103
Well, I-i wanna go talk to him.

17:10.137 --> 17:15.508
How do we make that happen?

17:15.542 --> 17:17.276
Rey, this is dr. Reese.

17:17.311 --> 17:18.521
She's gonna help
with the procedure.

17:18.546 --> 17:19.846
Hello, rey.

17:19.881 --> 17:21.224
How much longer
is this gonna take?

17:21.249 --> 17:23.215
Not too much.
We're gearing up now.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.984
Is it okay if I sit with him
until we get started, if...

17:26.021 --> 17:28.221
That's okay with you?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.355
Sure.

17:29.391 --> 17:31.357
You can stay. Okay.

17:38.033 --> 17:39.132
Dr. Halstead.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.233
You... you got a second?

17:40.268 --> 17:43.536
Yeah, of course.

17:43.571 --> 17:45.371
I just wanted to say...

17:45.407 --> 17:48.141
I appreciate you going
the extra mile here.

17:48.176 --> 17:50.143
With the diabetes,
let's just say

17:50.178 --> 17:52.545
I've seen my share
of doctors over the years.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.547
So few of them
really listen to you,

17:54.582 --> 17:56.315
Especially
in the emergency room.

17:56.351 --> 17:58.151
I'm just doing my job,
mr. Mikulski.

17:58.186 --> 17:59.152
You don't need to thank me.

17:59.187 --> 18:00.687
I know...

18:00.722 --> 18:03.222
But I want to.

18:03.258 --> 18:06.225
It's the first time I felt like
someone was in my corner.

18:06.261 --> 18:07.994
I'll tell anyone
who's listening.

18:08.029 --> 18:13.099
This is the best hospital
in the city, hands down.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.101
Thank you for saying that, ed.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.071
Any time.

18:23.578 --> 18:25.545
Your guy's scans came back.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.246
Sinus opacification.

18:27.282 --> 18:30.016
And invasion through
the cribriform plate.

18:30.051 --> 18:32.552
It's mucormycosis, most likely.

18:32.587 --> 18:35.121
And stohl wanted
to send him home.

18:35.156 --> 18:38.257
Who looks like he doesn't
know basic anatomy now?

18:38.293 --> 18:42.695
It's an amazing catch,
dr. Halstead.

18:42.731 --> 18:44.397
I knew it.

18:44.432 --> 18:45.965
Yeah.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.968
You the man, will.

18:49.003 --> 18:53.072
But this is bad news
for your patient, right?

18:55.510 --> 19:00.546
Yeah.

19:00.582 --> 19:02.415
I like your tattoos.

19:02.450 --> 19:03.549
Who designed them?

19:03.585 --> 19:06.552
Me. You're really talented.

19:06.588 --> 19:07.653
You go to school for that?

19:07.689 --> 19:09.122
No.

19:09.157 --> 19:11.991
Just fool around on my own.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.294
I saw you looking at my scars.

19:15.330 --> 19:16.674
You're not gonna
ask me about them?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.564
Do you wanna tell me about them?

19:18.600 --> 19:20.299
What are you,
a shrink or something?

19:20.335 --> 19:21.567
Not yet.

19:21.603 --> 19:25.004
Officially, I'm still training.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.274
Do you cut yourself, rey?

19:28.309 --> 19:30.143
I'm not crazy.

19:30.178 --> 19:32.211
I know.

19:35.316 --> 19:38.518
What I'm discovering
doing this is...

19:38.553 --> 19:41.420
How we all do things
that we can't explain.

19:41.456 --> 19:46.159
Things we say,
things we do to ourselves.

19:48.029 --> 19:50.163
Maybe we're just experimenting.

19:50.198 --> 19:52.431
To see how it feels.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.534
Or...

19:54.569 --> 19:57.403
Maybe we're reliving something
that happened to us in the past.

19:59.707 --> 20:03.309
Did something
happen to you, rey?

20:03.344 --> 20:04.544
Dr. Reese?

20:04.579 --> 20:10.283
Mr. Ochoa.

20:10.318 --> 20:12.285
The hell is this?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.687
People are saying
you're some kind of freak.

20:14.722 --> 20:17.156
It's not
what it looks like, papa.

20:17.192 --> 20:18.291
It was for wilmer.

20:18.326 --> 20:20.293
Your cousin?

20:20.328 --> 20:22.295
That fool's in crook county.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.397
He asked me
to smuggle a gun in for him.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.833
Said he needed
to protect himself.

20:26.868 --> 20:28.301
The guy in front of me beeped.

20:28.336 --> 20:30.303
Going through
the metal detector.

20:30.338 --> 20:32.305
They tackled him to the ground.

20:32.340 --> 20:34.307
I guess...

20:34.342 --> 20:35.842
I panicked.

20:35.877 --> 20:38.845
Ran out before
they could search me.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.715
The pain must have
made me pass out.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.418
Sorry.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.186
I know I messed up.

20:47.222 --> 20:50.256
No.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.825
No, mijo.

20:52.861 --> 20:56.329
You done good.

20:56.364 --> 20:58.631
You tell them
it was okay to remove it?

21:02.604 --> 21:04.270
It's my son. No, we understand...

21:04.305 --> 21:05.838
No. No, it's not gonna happen.

21:05.874 --> 21:08.140
I'm sorry.

21:16.217 --> 21:18.718
We'll have to put
the procedure on hold.

21:18.753 --> 21:20.119
Why?

21:20.154 --> 21:22.421
Our patient just
confessed to a crime.

21:22.457 --> 21:24.857
That means the gun
is considered evidence.

21:24.893 --> 21:28.427
And since his father convinced
him to withdraw consent,

21:28.463 --> 21:31.731
We'll have to secure
a warrant to remove it.

21:37.154 --> 21:41.157
Breaking bad news is the most
sobering of our obligations.

21:41.192 --> 21:42.737
No matter how many
I promtimes you do it,

21:42.761 --> 21:44.594
It never gets any easier.

21:44.629 --> 21:46.429
I fe...

21:46.464 --> 21:48.531
Excuse me. One second.

21:51.536 --> 21:52.935
Yeah?

21:52.971 --> 21:54.148
Any chance we can
do this off-camera?

21:54.172 --> 21:55.438
Off-camera?

21:55.473 --> 21:57.673
He didn't sign up for this.

21:57.709 --> 21:59.286
And it's probably
not gonna make the video.

21:59.310 --> 22:00.209
You're wrong.

22:00.245 --> 22:02.678
People wanna see
how compassionate we can be.

22:02.714 --> 22:04.447
But... It's so intrusive.

22:04.482 --> 22:06.015
You can't have it both ways.

22:06.050 --> 22:07.150
You wanted a release?

22:07.185 --> 22:14.123
This is what happens
when they sign it.

22:14.159 --> 22:17.126
A fungal infection in my brain?

22:17.162 --> 22:18.961
That... that doesn't sound good.

22:18.997 --> 22:21.264
No, not at all
what we were hoping for,

22:21.299 --> 22:23.633
But let's just take this
one step at a time.

22:23.668 --> 22:25.134
Okay... just so I know.

22:25.170 --> 22:26.969
What we're talking about here...

22:27.005 --> 22:29.505
Is this the kind of thing that
could keep me in the hospital?

22:29.541 --> 22:31.641
I would plan on that, yes.

22:31.676 --> 22:34.644
Should I plan on ever leaving?

22:34.679 --> 22:36.979
If it's advanced enough
to require surgery,

22:37.015 --> 22:41.284
Then you should know there's
about a 90% mortality rate.

22:41.319 --> 22:46.155
My god.

22:46.191 --> 22:47.990
I'm so sorry.

22:48.026 --> 22:50.092
Yes, it's a lot to process.

22:56.267 --> 22:59.502
I'm just glad
you spotted it when you did.

22:59.537 --> 23:01.370
Thank you.

23:01.406 --> 23:04.307
Thank you, both.

23:10.415 --> 23:11.692
State's attorneys
secured the warrant.

23:11.716 --> 23:13.249
We're a go.

23:13.284 --> 23:14.762
I don't believe that story
rey's telling about the gun,

23:14.786 --> 23:15.818
Do you?

23:15.854 --> 23:17.220
About smuggling it into jail?

23:17.255 --> 23:18.754
Who knows?
Did you notice the scars?

23:18.790 --> 23:20.223
On rey's arms?

23:20.258 --> 23:21.368
I'm pretty sure
he's been cutting himself.

23:21.392 --> 23:22.758
He's no stranger to self-harm.

23:22.794 --> 23:25.528
I'm sympathetic,
sarah, I truly am.

23:25.563 --> 23:26.607
I don't know what
you want me to do, though.

23:26.631 --> 23:28.764
I just want another chance
to get him to open up.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.533
Before he's swallowed up
by the system.

23:30.568 --> 23:33.502
How about we start by making
sure he survives this, okay?

23:40.812 --> 23:44.547
That should do it.

23:44.582 --> 23:47.783
Thank you, dr. Pellino.

23:47.819 --> 23:49.385
Looks good.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.687
I am, however, still
concerned about your ulcer.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.734
Have you ever thought about
maybe speaking to somebody.

23:53.758 --> 23:55.858
About reducing your stress?

23:55.894 --> 23:58.194
I can manage my stress.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.429
If I don't, then
the next person will.

24:00.465 --> 24:01.731
How's my daughter?

24:01.766 --> 24:04.433
Did you find anything?
No, not yet.

24:04.469 --> 24:06.302
Surprise, surprise.

24:06.337 --> 24:07.870
Listen, dr. Manning,

24:07.906 --> 24:09.750
I appreciate your efforts,
but I'm gonna need you.

24:09.774 --> 24:12.208
To discharge me and my daughter.

24:12.243 --> 24:15.411
I'll sign out against medical
advice if necessary.

24:15.446 --> 24:16.479
Sure.

24:16.514 --> 24:17.725
I'll get the paperwork started.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.715
Thanks.

24:19.751 --> 24:20.716
Yeah, hi.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.419
Hey. Any progress?

24:23.454 --> 24:25.288
Definitely
stressed out and anxious.

24:25.323 --> 24:28.424
Whether it rises to the level
of a disorder, I don't know.

24:28.459 --> 24:31.160
She mentioned a potentially
unhealthy association with food,

24:31.195 --> 24:32.061
But I'm just... I'm not getting.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.607
An eating disorder
vibe from her, you know?

24:33.631 --> 24:34.897
Me neither.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.599
Her weight is normal
for her height.

24:36.634 --> 24:38.345
She's not showing
any signs of malnourishment.

24:38.369 --> 24:39.747
And she says
her stomachache's gone,

24:39.771 --> 24:40.771
Her headache's gone.

24:40.805 --> 24:42.772
Her knee is hurting her now.

24:42.807 --> 24:44.351
I was thinking
we could give her a benzo.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.908
To see if
alleviating her anxiety.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.477
Might tell us something
about her physical symptoms?

24:48.513 --> 24:49.790
Unfortunately,
we don't have time.

24:49.814 --> 24:52.248
The mom wants to leave now.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.349
Dr. Charles?

24:53.384 --> 24:54.583
Dr. Latham called.

24:54.619 --> 24:55.829
Asked you to come to his office.

24:55.853 --> 24:56.919
He says it's urgent.

24:56.955 --> 24:57.920
Tell him I'll be right there.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.155
Okay.

25:01.326 --> 25:03.292
I've been staring
at these scans all afternoon.

25:03.328 --> 25:05.661
In a mirror
trying to retrain my brain.

25:05.697 --> 25:07.663
It's not working.

25:07.699 --> 25:10.800
The tms treatments have elicited
a very positive response.

25:10.835 --> 25:12.535
They've made
my brain more flexible,

25:12.570 --> 25:14.537
My thinking more supple.

25:14.572 --> 25:17.139
Perhaps if I had
another treatment?

25:17.175 --> 25:18.541
Wait.

25:18.576 --> 25:21.444
You're saying
you wanna undergo...

25:21.479 --> 25:23.813
A tms treatment
to prepare you to operate?

25:23.848 --> 25:26.449
Yes. I was going to
talk to dr. Weyland today,

25:26.484 --> 25:27.516
But she's unavailable.

25:27.552 --> 25:28.584
Yeah, well,

25:28.619 --> 25:31.554
She would tell you the same
thing that I'm about to,

25:31.589 --> 25:32.688
Which is no.

25:32.724 --> 25:33.823
Why not?

25:33.858 --> 25:35.324
You shouldn't do anything risky,

25:35.360 --> 25:37.693
Let alone perform
open-heart surgery.

25:37.729 --> 25:39.829
It would be derelict.

25:42.900 --> 25:43.866
Tell me, then,

25:43.901 --> 25:44.967
What is the solution?

25:45.003 --> 25:46.402
Well, the solution is to realize.

25:46.437 --> 25:48.304
That you don't have to
carry all the weight.

25:48.339 --> 25:49.972
On your shoulders.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.685
You have an excellent team.
Rely on your team,

25:51.709 --> 25:54.477
Rely on connor. No, I can't.

25:54.512 --> 25:55.845
I see the world differently now.

25:55.880 --> 25:59.849
The sarcasm, the hidden agendas.

25:59.884 --> 26:03.719
Even when my window is closed,
I know they're there.

26:03.755 --> 26:07.857
I have no one
to rely on now but myself.

26:07.892 --> 26:10.593
I think you'll find that
that's not the case.

26:10.628 --> 26:13.195
It's like trying to cut
your hair in front of a mirror.

26:13.231 --> 26:16.365
Left is right, right is left...

26:16.401 --> 26:18.868
Impossible.

26:18.903 --> 26:20.870
Left to right...

26:20.905 --> 26:22.905
Right to left...

26:30.615 --> 26:32.415
Dr. Halstead...

26:32.450 --> 26:33.416
He's having a seizure.

26:33.451 --> 26:34.950
Five of ativan, stat. On it.

26:34.986 --> 26:36.585
Feet are flushed.

26:37.588 --> 26:39.555
Below y-o-2? Suction ready.

26:39.590 --> 26:40.956
Ready.

26:40.992 --> 26:42.425
I'm gonna be
working late tonight,

26:42.460 --> 26:43.871
But mai will stay
with you until then.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.305
And don't even
think about using this.

26:45.329 --> 26:48.297
As an excuse
not to do your homework.

26:48.332 --> 26:50.566
Watch his airway.

26:50.601 --> 26:52.735
Seriously, ariel,
you've made your point.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.737
Stop putting on a show.

26:54.772 --> 26:56.739
Ariel? My god.

26:56.774 --> 26:57.774
Ariel?

26:57.809 --> 26:59.975
She's having a seizure.

27:00.011 --> 27:01.544
No, I don't think so.

27:01.579 --> 27:02.823
There's no nystagmus,
and her muscle movements.

27:02.847 --> 27:03.813
Are not asynchronous.

27:03.848 --> 27:06.048
Then what is wrong with her?

27:06.084 --> 27:07.483
We need to isolate her. What?

27:07.518 --> 27:09.051
She needs to be isolated, now.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.754
I need an empty room, now!

27:14.325 --> 27:15.724
We're gonna
get started now, rey.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.594
If you feel any discomfort,
just tell us.

27:18.629 --> 27:20.296
I need you to stop
moving your leg, rey.

27:20.331 --> 27:22.298
Where am I?

27:22.333 --> 27:24.300
Just keep still, bud.
Almost there.

27:24.335 --> 27:25.835
What?

27:27.472 --> 27:28.472
We've got a gun vacated.

27:28.506 --> 27:29.271
Jeff!

27:29.307 --> 27:30.840
Go, go! Are you okay, jeff?

27:30.875 --> 27:32.842
Agh! I'm all right,
I'm all right. How's he?

27:32.877 --> 27:34.988
Exit wound in the right lower
quadrant, we need a trauma lab.

27:35.012 --> 27:36.745
Pack the wound and
let's get him to the o.R.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.981
Ready? One, two, three.

27:39.016 --> 27:42.852
All right, we're moving him.

27:42.887 --> 27:44.587
Let me take a look.

27:44.622 --> 27:46.342
All right, watch your backs.
Coming through.

27:57.319 --> 27:59.185
How we doing? Okay.

27:59.221 --> 28:01.554
How's that knee doing?

28:01.590 --> 28:03.289
It feels fine, actually.

28:03.325 --> 28:06.026
What if I told you that
that was because...

28:06.061 --> 28:07.694
I just took an advil?

28:07.729 --> 28:10.430
I don't understand.

28:13.235 --> 28:14.567
Why'd you do that?

28:14.603 --> 28:15.713
It feel like I just slapped you?

28:15.737 --> 28:17.037
Yes!

28:17.072 --> 28:18.571
I'm sorry.

28:18.607 --> 28:23.276
I don't like this game.

28:23.311 --> 28:25.278
<i>I don't understand.</i>

28:25.313 --> 28:27.814
<i>Why'd you do that?</i>

28:27.849 --> 28:31.284
<i>- Feel like I just slapped you?
- Yes.</i>

28:31.319 --> 28:32.819
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:32.854 --> 28:34.421
What were you doing
to my daughter?

28:34.456 --> 28:36.556
I was trying to
confirm a diagnosis.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.559
Um... I want neurology
to run some tests,

28:39.594 --> 28:42.562
But based on this
and ariel's history,

28:42.597 --> 28:46.566
I think that she has a condition
called mirror touch synesthesia.

28:46.601 --> 28:47.700
What?

28:47.736 --> 28:50.170
It's a condition that...
That causes her to experience.

28:50.205 --> 28:53.640
The physical sensations
and emotions of the people.

28:53.675 --> 28:55.642
That she's interacting with...

28:55.677 --> 28:57.243
As her own.

28:57.279 --> 28:59.646
My left knee hurts,

28:59.681 --> 29:01.648
Ariel feels it in her right.

29:01.683 --> 29:03.249
I slap my right cheek,

29:03.285 --> 29:05.251
She feels like
her left is being slapped.

29:05.287 --> 29:06.753
She's mirroring me.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.488
Her stomach...

29:08.523 --> 29:10.323
She's responding to your ulcer,

29:10.358 --> 29:11.491
Not imitating you.

29:11.526 --> 29:14.260
She's literally
feeling your pain.

29:16.531 --> 29:17.764
Whoever heard of such a thing?

29:17.799 --> 29:19.632
It's a pretty recent discovery,

29:19.668 --> 29:22.268
The existence of
these mirror neurons.

29:22.304 --> 29:23.269
Is there a cure?

29:23.305 --> 29:25.638
Not yet, but there are...

29:25.674 --> 29:27.273
Coping strategies
we can teach her.

29:27.309 --> 29:32.445
To help her
manage her condition.

29:38.887 --> 29:42.188
I'm sorry, I...

29:42.224 --> 29:44.858
I have to get this.

29:44.893 --> 29:47.460
Yeah?

29:47.496 --> 29:50.697
I cannot believe this woman.

29:50.732 --> 29:52.165
How's that old saying go?

29:52.200 --> 29:53.277
You can lead a horse to water,

29:53.301 --> 29:56.536
But you can't make it
gaze at its own reflection.

29:59.207 --> 30:01.608
Page me when he's all set.
Yes, doctor.

30:03.612 --> 30:04.711
Excuse me.

30:04.746 --> 30:05.645
Dr. Rhodes?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.714
Looks like I'm filling in
for beth today.

30:07.749 --> 30:09.327
I understand there's
some confusion about.

30:09.351 --> 30:10.595
Where we're supposed
to be standing?

30:10.619 --> 30:11.718
Yeah...

30:13.522 --> 30:16.589
Let me get back to you on that.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.191
Beth.

30:18.226 --> 30:19.303
Forget it.
No, please, please, please.

30:19.327 --> 30:20.738
I'm not changing my mind!
Nope, no, no, no, no.

30:20.762 --> 30:26.499
Just one second of your time.

30:26.535 --> 30:29.836
Look, I am not gonna try and
defend dr. Latham's behavior.

30:29.871 --> 30:33.273
He flung a tray past my head.

30:33.308 --> 30:34.548
Not the first time, by the way.

30:34.576 --> 30:37.343
But he is the guy that's gotta
try to save that patient's life,

30:37.379 --> 30:39.179
And while you and I
both know that.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.847
He would never
admit it out loud,

30:40.882 --> 30:42.715
He relies on you.

30:42.751 --> 30:44.450
I mean, come on,
we rely on each other.

30:44.486 --> 30:45.718
We're a team.

30:45.754 --> 30:47.720
Someone should tell him that.

30:47.756 --> 30:49.455
He treats us like dirt.

30:49.491 --> 30:51.224
Yeah.

30:51.259 --> 30:52.892
But I do know this
about dr. Latham.

30:52.928 --> 30:55.361
He always has the patient's
best interests at heart,

30:55.397 --> 30:58.698
And we should too.

30:58.733 --> 31:00.767
Really?

31:03.405 --> 31:04.737
Dr. Rhodes. My office, please.

31:04.773 --> 31:10.443
Yes, sir.

31:10.478 --> 31:16.449
Close the door.

31:16.484 --> 31:18.318
Dr. Latham,
I'm not sure how much of that.

31:18.353 --> 31:22.455
You heard back there.
I believe most of it.

31:22.490 --> 31:24.457
If I said anything
that may have offended you,

31:24.492 --> 31:26.893
I'm sorry... I was only trying...

31:26.928 --> 31:29.329
There's something
I should share with you.

31:29.364 --> 31:30.730
I have been recently diagnosed.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.599
With an autism
spectrum disorder.

31:32.634 --> 31:34.901
Asperger's.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.903
Okay.

31:36.938 --> 31:39.339
I'm not revealing this
to elicit sympathy from you,

31:39.374 --> 31:41.908
Or as a means
to justify my behavior.

31:41.943 --> 31:45.612
I simply feel it might be
beneficial for you to know.

31:45.647 --> 31:47.714
I think it might be.

31:50.051 --> 31:52.752
I am unable to discern whether
you're being sarcastic or not.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.488
That's part of the disorder.

31:55.523 --> 31:57.924
It also makes it
difficult for me to.

31:57.959 --> 32:01.494
Improvise from my set routine.

32:01.529 --> 32:04.264
I confess, i...

32:04.299 --> 32:07.834
I'm uneasy about the surgery
we're about to perform.

32:11.573 --> 32:15.008
Can I rely on you
to help me through it?

32:18.747 --> 32:20.313
Tell me there was
no brown in there.

32:20.348 --> 32:23.816
You're right.
How's our human shield doing?

32:23.852 --> 32:26.019
Just finished
washing it out now.

32:26.054 --> 32:28.032
That's what I get for
trusting a squid with a firearm.

32:28.056 --> 32:29.889
Ha. Thank you, both.

32:29.924 --> 32:31.891
Really.

32:31.926 --> 32:33.993
Ms. Goodwin?

32:34.029 --> 32:35.728
If you have a second?

32:35.764 --> 32:37.864
The fungal infection
is quite advanced.

32:37.899 --> 32:39.510
Okay, mr. Mikulski's
on his way up to the o.R.

32:39.534 --> 32:43.002
And at this stage, he's not
gonna survive this.

32:43.038 --> 32:46.472
There's nothing we could have
done; It was a bad, bad break.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.008
I don't see how we can use
any of the footage we shot.

32:49.044 --> 32:50.109
I disagree.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.645
We couldn't have gotten
a better endorsement for you,

32:52.681 --> 32:53.813
Or the hospital.

32:53.848 --> 32:54.814
His endorsement is meaningless.

32:54.849 --> 32:57.050
He just said what he thought
we wanted to hear.

32:57.085 --> 32:59.052
Not to mention,
we're exploiting him!

32:59.087 --> 33:00.820
Exploiting?

33:00.855 --> 33:02.388
He signed the release.

33:02.424 --> 33:04.924
What are we arguing about?

33:04.959 --> 33:07.660
He only did it
'cause I convinced him to.

33:07.696 --> 33:10.129
I'm not sure he really
wanted to sign the release.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.002
All right, let's...

33:16.037 --> 33:18.871
Let's give the patient a chance
to rescind the release.

33:18.907 --> 33:20.506
What? Why?

33:20.542 --> 33:23.876
Because it's
the right thing to do.

33:23.912 --> 33:25.745
Thank you, ms. Goodwin.

33:25.780 --> 33:27.814
Dr. Halstead.

33:29.784 --> 33:32.618
You convinced him
to sign the release,

33:32.654 --> 33:37.357
Yet you led me to believe
you objected to all of this.

33:37.392 --> 33:39.625
I felt I needed some ammo.

33:39.661 --> 33:41.761
When I told stohl
I was ordering the scans.

33:43.798 --> 33:47.633
So in other words, you used
the release to get your way?

33:47.669 --> 33:50.036
No, no, no.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.804
Go talk to your patient,

33:51.840 --> 33:54.107
And we'll talk about
your actions later.

34:05.762 --> 34:08.996
Last thing to do is to
anastamose the right coronary.

34:09.032 --> 34:13.034
The right coronary...

34:13.069 --> 34:15.036
I have an angle to get you
a better position,

34:15.071 --> 34:18.739
If you don't mind, dr. Latham?
No, please, go ahead.

34:18.775 --> 34:21.309
All right.

34:22.679 --> 34:23.755
It doesn't appear as though.

34:23.780 --> 34:24.924
It's gonna be
long enough to fit,

34:24.947 --> 34:26.525
Unless you're seeing
something different?

34:26.549 --> 34:28.527
Let's get some blood in there
to see how the vessel lays.

34:28.551 --> 34:29.750
When the heart's inflated.

34:29.786 --> 34:30.751
Clamp your venus, paul,

34:30.786 --> 34:31.752
Give us some volume.

34:31.788 --> 34:36.489
Yes, sir.

34:36.525 --> 34:37.757
Looks like it'll fit.

34:37.793 --> 34:39.025
Good.

34:39.062 --> 34:42.496
Let's empty out the heart
and finish up.

34:42.532 --> 34:44.264
6-0 prolene?

34:44.300 --> 34:46.634
Thank you, beth.

34:52.609 --> 34:55.710
There you go. I like it.

34:56.946 --> 34:58.379
Hey, dr. Halstead.

34:58.414 --> 35:00.781
Thanks for coming up.

35:00.817 --> 35:02.917
How do I look? [Chuckles.

35:02.952 --> 35:05.052
Whoa, where's that camera guy?

35:05.088 --> 35:06.053
Hey, listen.

35:06.089 --> 35:08.623
About that...

35:08.658 --> 35:09.790
I'm sorry.

35:09.826 --> 35:13.928
This promo video has been a huge
violation in your privacy.

35:13.963 --> 35:17.031
I know you were hesitant
to sign the release, so...

35:18.935 --> 35:20.468
You rip that up if you want,

35:20.503 --> 35:24.772
And we will not use
any of the footage.

35:24.807 --> 35:27.475
Let me ask you
a question, dr. Halstead.

35:27.510 --> 35:29.644
Do I look familiar to you?

35:29.679 --> 35:32.046
I mean, from before today?

35:32.081 --> 35:34.782
I don't think so. Why?

35:34.817 --> 35:36.784
I recognize you.

35:36.819 --> 35:40.388
You sometimes park
in that lot across the street.

35:40.423 --> 35:42.790
I work there as an attendant.

35:42.825 --> 35:46.394
Almost 20 years now.

35:46.429 --> 35:47.928
Sorry, I never
really paid attention.

35:47.964 --> 35:49.964
No, that's okay.

35:49.999 --> 35:53.834
I don't make
much of an impression.

35:53.870 --> 35:59.774
I've had more than enough
privacy for one person.

35:59.809 --> 36:03.511
So I'm okay
having that violated now.

36:03.546 --> 36:08.516
If it means I wasn't
invisible to the very end.

36:08.551 --> 36:11.986
I just want my life
to have meant something.

36:17.727 --> 36:19.794
Dr. Halstead?

36:25.968 --> 36:29.670
Are you ready, mr. Mikulski?

36:29.706 --> 36:32.440
Yes, I am.

36:37.714 --> 36:39.814
Okay.

36:49.826 --> 36:51.058
Hey.

36:51.094 --> 36:53.527
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

36:53.563 --> 36:54.795
This?

36:54.831 --> 36:59.533
Might leave a scar,
but that's it.

36:59.569 --> 37:01.902
Well, at least you'll have
a good story to tell, right?

37:02.939 --> 37:05.172
I don't think anybody
will believe this one.

37:08.711 --> 37:10.544
Okay, see you.

37:10.580 --> 37:13.547
Yeah, see you.

37:13.583 --> 37:16.917
It's a cylinder... It's shiny.

37:16.953 --> 37:19.920
Sorry to interrupt.
Not at all, we're just...

37:19.956 --> 37:21.822
We're just doing
a visualization exercise.

37:21.858 --> 37:24.658
Again.
Close your eyes again, ariel.

37:24.694 --> 37:28.529
And... Do you see your shield?

37:28.564 --> 37:31.766
Okay. Now keep
describing it to me.

37:31.801 --> 37:34.535
It's gold.

37:34.570 --> 37:37.204
It surrounds me.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.673
It protects me from
other people's pain,

37:39.709 --> 37:41.675
And emotions.

37:41.711 --> 37:44.779
Okay, keep seeing your shield.

37:44.814 --> 37:48.549
Now open your eyes.

37:48.584 --> 37:51.118
What happens when I do this?

37:51.154 --> 37:53.854
It feels like you're
touching my arm still.

37:53.890 --> 37:55.256
The shield's not working.

37:55.291 --> 37:56.590
Visualization... it's a skill.

37:56.626 --> 37:57.658
It takes practice.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.127
And just so you know,
when I visualize my shield...

38:00.163 --> 38:04.598
And be warned 'cause
I'm a total geek about this...

38:04.634 --> 38:05.533
Hey, come on, now.

38:05.568 --> 38:07.568
You're not allowed
to get down on yourself.

38:07.603 --> 38:10.571
This is our very first run
at this; You're doing great.

38:10.606 --> 38:12.706
It's not that.

38:12.742 --> 38:15.709
I just got really sad.

38:15.745 --> 38:20.815
Don't know why.

38:20.850 --> 38:22.550
Will you excuse me?

38:22.585 --> 38:24.084
Okay, let's try it again.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.187
Close your eyes.

38:29.592 --> 38:31.659
Hey, dr. Latham.

38:31.694 --> 38:35.563
A bunch of us are going
for drinks over at molly's.

38:35.598 --> 38:37.832
Maybe you want to join us?

38:37.867 --> 38:39.900
I don't go to bars.

38:42.004 --> 38:44.238
Maybe another time, then.

38:59.722 --> 39:01.200
I hear they're gonna
transfer you to the hospital.

39:01.224 --> 39:03.290
At the county jail.

39:06.229 --> 39:09.830
I don't believe
that story you told earlier.

39:09.866 --> 39:12.700
I know you thought it's what
your father wanted to hear,

39:12.735 --> 39:14.213
But it would be
a shame to go to jail.

39:14.237 --> 39:16.837
For something you didn't do.

39:16.873 --> 39:19.840
I'm not afraid of going to jail.

39:19.876 --> 39:21.019
That secret you're holding onto.

39:21.043 --> 39:23.711
Just put a hole in your gut.

39:23.746 --> 39:27.281
If you don't open up, imagine
what might happen next time.

39:35.858 --> 39:37.958
All you have to do is call,

39:37.994 --> 39:40.027
And we can keep talking.

39:49.005 --> 39:52.840
You don't understand
anything, do you?

39:52.875 --> 39:54.842
You want me to talk?

39:54.877 --> 39:56.844
Open up?

39:56.879 --> 39:59.580
And say what?

39:59.615 --> 40:02.983
That I'm some kind of freak?

40:03.019 --> 40:05.686
I'd rather go to jail.

40:05.721 --> 40:07.788
Forever.

40:16.732 --> 40:20.935
She can really feel
the pain of everyone she sees?

40:20.970 --> 40:22.369
Yes.

40:22.405 --> 40:25.406
God.

40:27.410 --> 40:29.977
I can't imagine how hard
this has been for her.

40:32.148 --> 40:33.948
I took her to every specialist.

40:33.983 --> 40:37.251
I did what the doctors
told me to.

40:37.286 --> 40:38.953
I thought she was faking.

40:38.988 --> 40:41.255
There's no way
you could've known.

40:41.290 --> 40:44.858
I am hurting my own daughter.

40:44.894 --> 40:46.271
How am I supposed
to protect her from this.

40:46.295 --> 40:49.296
If I'm part of the problem?

40:49.332 --> 40:51.298
