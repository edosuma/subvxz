-Dare I look?
-Oh, don't worry. It's completely gone.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.503
I've no desire to kill Arthur.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.964
GWEN:
That's great news.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.050
Although I'm afraid, right now,
he does want to kill you.

41:16.224 --> 41:19.602
Two whole days in the tavern.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.021
[CHUCKLES]

41:22.188 --> 41:24.023
I'm not quite sure it was that long.

41:24.190 --> 41:27.485
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
get rid of you on the spot.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.739
Because you would have no one
to polish your armor...

41:31.906 --> 41:34.450
...make you breakfast,
organize your clothes.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.494
Ah, well, that's where you're wrong.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.913
George.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.959
Merlin, meet George.

41:43.126 --> 41:47.088
George is perhaps the most
efficient servant I've ever seen.

41:47.255 --> 41:50.049
-He'll be spending the week teaching you.
-Teaching me?

41:50.216 --> 41:52.260
If you wish to remain in my service.

41:52.427 --> 41:53.803
GEORGE:
We will start in the armory.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.139
Lesson one is my favorite: polishing.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.560
Yes, that's my favorite too.

42:07.817 --> 42:09.569
Tell me something.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.158
If he's so good,
why don't you just give him the job?

42:16.034 --> 42:19.120
He's seriously boring.
I've never met anyone so dull.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.914
The man makes jokes about brass.

42:26.044 --> 42:29.547
Anyway, off you go. It'll be fun.

42:53.863 --> 42:55.406
AGRAVAINE:
Morgana?

43:05.792 --> 43:07.376
Morgana?

43:20.932 --> 43:23.976
Morgana. Morgana.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.751
MALE VOICE:
Merlin.

43:50.378 --> 43:51.420
Go on, sleep.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.756
| know everyone thinks he's a traitor,
but he's not.

43:53.923 --> 43:56.217
He's been abducted. He may even be dead.

43:56.717 --> 44:00.638
Who is Emrys?

44:00.847 --> 44:04.350
Merlin's onto us.
He's out searching for Gaius even as we speak.

44:04.559 --> 44:07.270
-So you know who Emrys is?
-Indeed, I do.

44:08.855 --> 44:10.148
Then tell me.

44:55.735 --> 44:56.736
