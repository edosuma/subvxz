<b>Someone's running around

00:05.260 --> 00:06.610
<b>Can you kill them?</b>

00:07.400 --> 00:08.940
<b>You can count on me.</b>

00:11.300 --> 00:13.470
<b>Hmm... No problem.</b>

00:14.270 --> 00:16.660
<b>You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.</b>

00:17.750 --> 00:19.250
<b>I will stop them all.</b>

01:39.990 --> 01:45.000
<b>Tracking x And x Pursuit</b>

01:46.780 --> 01:51.910
<b>Knuckle and Shoot are on the

01:51.910 --> 01:53.660
<b>as he attempts to return to the King.</b>

01:59.440 --> 02:00.630
<b>He's close.</b>

02:00.630 --> 02:01.530
<b>Okay.</b>

02:03.680 --> 02:05.000
<b>He's following the road.</b>

02:05.740 --> 02:09.010
<b>If he continues on it, 
he'll pass by in ten minutes.</b>

02:09.010 --> 02:11.750
<b>Do you think he'll stick to the road?</b>

02:11.750 --> 02:15.470
<b>No, he'll notice my presence 
just before he gets here.</b>

02:15.900 --> 02:20.030
<b>Because APR will start adding interest again.</b>

02:20.240 --> 02:22.530
<b>But given his speed...</b>

02:23.080 --> 02:27.980
<b><i>We may be able to attack him 
just before APR adds interest.</i></b>

02:28.660 --> 02:31.910
<b>I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens

02:29.610 --> 02:31.920
<b>Knuckle's ability, Chapter 7 Bankruptcy,</b>

02:31.920 --> 02:33.540
<b>attaches APR to an enemy.</b>

02:34.070 --> 02:37.470
<b>Every ten seconds, APR informs the 
enemy that interest will be added.</b>

02:37.470 --> 02:43.850
<b>But if the enemy is over a hundred meters 
away from Knuckle, the interest stops.</b>

02:44.430 --> 02:47.830
<b>When this happens, the time 
until the next interest payment</b>

02:47.830 --> 02:50.150
<b>is remembered by APR.</b>

02:50.670 --> 02:54.980
<b>Once the enemy is back within 
Knuckle's hundred-meter range,</b>

02:54.980 --> 02:58.030
<b>APR picks up where it stopped.</b>

02:59.830 --> 03:04.080
<b><i>He's approaching at a speed between 
160 and 180 kilometers per hour.</i></b>

03:04.640 --> 03:08.830
<b><i>If there are still three seconds or more 
before APR adds interest again,</i></b>

03:08.830 --> 03:13.130
<b><i>there's a good chance we can 
attack before he notices us.</i></b>

03:14.130 --> 03:14.880
<b>Here he comes!</b>

03:26.640 --> 03:27.620
<b><i>What's wrong?</i></b>

03:29.330 --> 03:30.850
<b>Damn, what happened?</b>

03:31.680 --> 03:34.080
<b>At the last second, he suddenly changed direction!</b>

03:35.050 --> 03:35.940
<b>He's down below!</b>

03:35.940 --> 03:36.700
<b>Knuckle...</b>

03:37.550 --> 03:39.300
<b>Don't bother. We can't catch up.</b>

03:39.300 --> 03:41.820
<b>Our opponent has a cheetah's speed.</b>

03:43.070 --> 03:45.530
<b>He isn't supposed to know 
how to deal with <i>Zetsu</i>.</b>

03:45.970 --> 03:48.020
<b>How did he discover our ambush?</b>

03:48.560 --> 03:49.500
<b>Could it be...</b>

03:55.740 --> 03:57.420
<b><i>We're slightly downwind.</i></b>

03:58.810 --> 04:01.510
<b><i>The breeze is blowing this way 
with no change in direction.</i></b>

04:01.510 --> 04:02.790
<b><i>So he didn't smell us.</i></b>

04:02.790 --> 04:03.610
<b>Look up!</b>

04:06.400 --> 04:07.680
<b>What's that?</b>

04:09.320 --> 04:11.790
<b>I've discovered two suspicious figures.</b>

04:11.790 --> 04:12.690
<b>What should I do?</b>

04:13.090 --> 04:16.500
<b>Ignore them. They aren't the target.</b>

04:16.500 --> 04:19.440
<b>No point in doing more work than necessary.</b>

04:19.440 --> 04:20.190
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

04:20.900 --> 04:24.830
<b>It appears they were trying 
to ambush Cheetu-sama.</b>

04:24.830 --> 04:27.950
<b>Oh, he's in the area?</b>

04:28.430 --> 04:31.830
<b>I warned Cheetu-sama before he ran into their trap.</b>

04:31.830 --> 04:33.660
<b>Was that unnecessary?</b>

04:34.610 --> 04:36.150
<b>What did Cheetu do?</b>

04:36.150 --> 04:38.230
<b>He took a detour toward the capital.</b>

04:38.230 --> 04:41.010
<b>He told me to thank you for the help.</b>

04:41.970 --> 04:43.840
<b>I see, good work.</b>

04:44.980 --> 04:46.870
<b>He owes me now.</b>

04:49.290 --> 04:50.510
<b>This is Leol.</b>

04:50.510 --> 04:54.700
<b>The target just engaged a squad of 
soldiers in the city of Longtong.</b>

04:55.550 --> 04:56.770
<b>Longtong?</b>

04:57.190 --> 04:59.880
<b>Head north and try to cut it off.</b>

04:59.880 --> 05:01.520
<b>Just a hunch.</b>

05:01.940 --> 05:02.850
<b>Understood.</b>

05:03.570 --> 05:06.230
<b>Looks like even the army can't handle this.</b>

05:06.230 --> 05:09.840
<b>No... Well, they're only there to buy time.</b>

05:09.840 --> 05:14.120
<b>They've had to stay in one area 
for a longer period of time.</b>

05:14.440 --> 05:19.680
<b>After all, it's been moving constantly 
for over thirty hours.</b>

05:23.890 --> 05:26.380
<b>Diego has fallen into enemy hands!</b>

05:26.890 --> 05:29.640
<b>If you stay in your homes, you'll be killed!</b>

05:29.640 --> 05:31.050
<b>Liar!</b>

05:31.050 --> 05:31.890
<b>Rebel scum!</b>

05:33.820 --> 05:38.770
<b><i>Damn... Diego just appeared on TV, 
looking alive and well.</i></b>

05:38.770 --> 05:40.410
<b><i>The odds are against me now.</i></b>

05:41.530 --> 05:43.400
<b><i>I'll have to give up my instigation.</i></b>

05:43.400 --> 05:47.020
<b><i>My only option is to take out as many 
puppets and soldiers as I can!</i></b>

05:52.060 --> 05:55.410
<b>Should I go north next?</b>

06:01.140 --> 06:02.210
<b><i>I knew it.</i></b>

06:02.530 --> 06:04.340
<b><i>Someone's still following me!</i></b>

06:06.370 --> 06:07.430
<b>Who's there?!</b>

06:07.430 --> 06:09.360
<b>If you want something, show yourself!</b>

06:13.480 --> 06:15.400
<b><i>The presence has completely vanished.</i></b>

06:16.030 --> 06:19.430
<b><i>It might be following me until 
more Chimera Ants show up.</i></b>

06:21.770 --> 06:23.360
<b><i>I'm gonna shake it!</i></b>

06:23.740 --> 06:25.860
<b><i>It can't outlast me!</i></b>

06:27.920 --> 06:28.760
<b>Yo...</b>

06:28.760 --> 06:29.410
<b>Yo.</b>

06:29.880 --> 06:32.080
<b>Sorry for stopping you.</b>

06:32.080 --> 06:34.630
<b>Nah, I was headed this way.</b>

06:34.630 --> 06:36.950
<b>The King's in this direction, right, Hagya?</b>

06:38.350 --> 06:40.080
<b>Yeah, I know. It's Leol now.</b>

06:40.780 --> 06:43.050
<b>Then you did that on purpose?</b>

06:43.050 --> 06:44.840
<b>You're still a bastard.</b>

06:44.960 --> 06:47.630
<b>Flutter's warning was a big help.</b>

06:47.630 --> 06:49.810
<b>Right now, I'm trying to avoid fights...</b>

06:50.280 --> 06:51.870
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

06:52.420 --> 06:54.220
<b>By the way, what's that thing?</b>

06:56.640 --> 06:57.820
<b>No idea.</b>

06:57.820 --> 07:00.250
<b>A Hunter hit me with it.</b>

07:00.990 --> 07:03.310
<b>It follows me wherever I run.</b>

07:03.310 --> 07:04.230
<b>Not sure what to do.</b>

07:04.750 --> 07:08.290
<b>But so far, it doesn't seem to have any effect.</b>

07:08.760 --> 07:10.160
<b>Want me to get rid of it?</b>

07:11.380 --> 07:13.740
<b>Do you want me to get rid of it?</b>

07:15.430 --> 07:16.430
<b>You can do that?</b>

07:17.070 --> 07:18.370
<b>Probably.</b>

07:19.200 --> 07:20.620
<b>But not for free, right?</b>

07:22.360 --> 07:24.380
<b>I'm glad you're so understanding.</b>

07:24.380 --> 07:25.940
<b>Figured.</b>

07:26.330 --> 07:29.160
<b>The Royal Guard has assigned me a mission.</b>

07:29.160 --> 07:31.040
<b>I'd like your help.</b>

07:31.040 --> 07:32.380
<b>Leol-sama...</b>

07:33.390 --> 07:35.350
<b>I've spotted the target.</b>

07:35.350 --> 07:39.390
<b>He's headed north on the road through 
the forest northeast of Longtong.</b>

07:41.610 --> 07:45.050
<b>Neferpitou-dono's hunch was right...</b>

07:45.550 --> 07:47.210
<b>Don't let him get away.</b>

07:47.210 --> 07:49.410
<b>Use all your forces to slow him down.</b>

07:49.790 --> 07:50.400
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

07:51.530 --> 07:53.510
<b>We're chasing down a human.</b>

07:53.510 --> 07:54.990
<b>He's probably a Hunter.</b>

07:55.850 --> 07:58.260
<b>And you want me to help hunt him?</b>

07:58.800 --> 08:00.410
<b>You said he's a Hunter?</b>

08:00.410 --> 08:03.380
<b>They can be tough to deal with...</b>

08:03.380 --> 08:06.180
<b>Of course, so I've planned ahead.</b>

08:07.170 --> 08:11.850
<b>Shaiapouf-dono has prepared 
a power tailored for you.</b>

08:11.850 --> 08:14.430
<b>He will teach you to use it.</b>

08:14.430 --> 08:17.050
<b>With luck, you can master it in a day.</b>

08:17.050 --> 08:21.460
<b>I'm a slow learner, so mine took me 
three days to get the hang of.</b>

08:22.390 --> 08:24.540
<b>Sounds like a sweet deal...</b>

08:25.600 --> 08:27.950
<b>In return, I swear loyalty to the King?</b>

08:29.490 --> 08:32.040
<b>Exactly... Easy enough, right?</b>

08:33.020 --> 08:35.310
<b>Sure, I just wanted an explanation.</b>

08:36.490 --> 08:38.850
<b>You're a sharp fellow.</b>

08:38.850 --> 08:40.950
<b>If you accept, return to the castle,</b>

08:40.950 --> 08:44.140
<b>master your new power, 
and then contact me.</b>

08:44.610 --> 08:48.270
<b>In the meantime, I'll have my underlings 
determine the target's abilities.</b>

08:49.520 --> 08:51.570
<b>Well, I guess I owe you one.</b>

08:51.570 --> 08:52.990
<b>Might as well.</b>

08:52.990 --> 08:57.080
<b>Anyway, you're still all about stealing glory.</b>

08:58.900 --> 09:00.210
<b>Naturally.</b>

09:00.540 --> 09:02.980
<b>I was once king of the jungle.</b>

09:05.060 --> 09:07.800
<b>Obviously, you're looking to retake the throne.</b>

09:10.100 --> 09:13.130
<b><i>Damn, I'm being followed.</i></b>

09:13.600 --> 09:16.520
<b><i>And he's way out of yo-yo range.</i></b>

09:16.520 --> 09:19.240
<b><i>If I don't lose him or defeat him, I'll be in trouble.</i></b>

09:23.810 --> 09:25.500
<b><i>There's a jungle over there!</i></b>

09:26.930 --> 09:28.810
<b><i>The leaves are dense enough,</i></b>

09:28.810 --> 09:31.270
<b><i>he shouldn't be able to see me from the air.</i></b>

09:31.730 --> 09:34.790
<b><i>If he descends to follow, 
he'll be in range of my yo-yo!</i></b>

09:44.500 --> 09:45.340
<b><i>He isn't coming?</i></b>

09:45.770 --> 09:46.760
<b><i>Did I lose him?</i></b>

09:47.110 --> 09:51.010
<b><i>But in that case, he should 
come looking for me.</i></b>

09:52.800 --> 09:54.010
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

09:54.010 --> 09:55.860
<b><i>I don't have time to wait around!</i></b>

09:55.860 --> 09:57.530
<b><i>Hurry up, already!</i></b>

09:59.580 --> 10:02.530
<b>You can't hide from me.</b>

10:03.200 --> 10:05.230
<b>Go forth, soldiers of Leol.</b>

10:05.230 --> 10:07.290
<b>Capture your prey!</b>

10:12.030 --> 10:14.390
<b><i>Something's coming, but from the opposite side,</i></b>

10:14.390 --> 10:15.550
<b><i>and it's on the ground!</i></b>

10:29.790 --> 10:33.320
<b><i>He removed his foe's head 
and arms with one swing!</i></b>

10:33.470 --> 10:35.770
<b><i>I can't beat him in a one-on-one, 
close-quarters fight...</i></b>

10:36.170 --> 10:37.480
<b>Where is he?!</b>

10:37.480 --> 10:38.900
<b>Captain! Above you!</b>

11:01.200 --> 11:02.240
<b>I'm gonna die—</b>

11:09.480 --> 11:10.980
<b><i>I missed two of them!</i></b>

11:11.580 --> 11:15.170
<b><i>We're attacking him en masse, in the treetops,
and we can't even touch him!</i></b>

11:15.170 --> 11:15.900
<b>Retreat!</b>

11:15.900 --> 11:16.980
<b>Time to regroup!</b>

11:18.620 --> 11:20.110
<b>I won't let you escape...</b>

11:20.390 --> 11:22.110
<b>You must be the leader.</b>

11:22.110 --> 11:23.940
<b>I'll eliminate you first!</b>

11:34.370 --> 11:37.800
<b>How'd you like that blast?</b>

11:46.950 --> 11:48.890
<b>That bastard...</b>

11:48.890 --> 11:51.690
<b>He blew a fart at me!</b>

11:53.500 --> 11:55.410
<b><i>No, there's a bigger problem...</i></b>

11:55.800 --> 11:59.440
<b><i>I completely concealed my presence, 
and attacked from his blind spot.</i></b>

11:59.440 --> 12:01.750
<b><i>But he countered at the perfect time.</i></b>

12:03.270 --> 12:05.980
<b><i>Someone must be instructing 
him from a distance.</i></b>

12:07.650 --> 12:08.790
<b><i>It must be him!</i></b>

12:09.540 --> 12:12.040
<b><i>He's probably watching right now.</i></b>

12:12.040 --> 12:15.670
<b><i>I'd guess he has a power that 
lets him track my location.</i></b>

12:17.100 --> 12:18.300
<b><i>In that case...</i></b>

12:20.300 --> 12:22.680
<b><i>I can't show him the cards 
in my hand, no matter what.</i></b>

12:22.680 --> 12:26.110
<b><i>I don't want them to learn 
of my lightning or yo-yo!</i></b>

12:27.200 --> 12:30.390
<b><i>The ideal scenario would be to lose 
them and go back into hiding.</i></b>

12:30.390 --> 12:31.930
<b><i>But that's looking impossible.</i></b>

12:32.370 --> 12:33.840
<b><i>I'll have to defeat them all without using—</i></b>

12:36.420 --> 12:37.360
<b><i>A gun?</i></b>

12:38.610 --> 12:39.430
<b><i>No...</i></b>

12:39.430 --> 12:41.440
<b><i>There's something stuck to my face...</i></b>

12:46.030 --> 12:46.960
<b><i>A flea?</i></b>

12:53.490 --> 12:54.430
<b><i>A flea?</i></b>

12:57.990 --> 12:59.290
<b>Damn!</b>

12:59.760 --> 13:01.510
<b><i>Where did it come from?!</i></b>

13:04.550 --> 13:10.670
<b>Area TH-88, X-15, Y-12, Z-2.</b>

13:10.670 --> 13:15.320
<b>Point X-9, Y-3, Z-1.</b>

13:17.590 --> 13:18.770
<b>Okay.</b>

13:24.000 --> 13:27.740
<b>There's no escaping...</b>

13:28.250 --> 13:34.400
<b>from my Fleadom, oh yeah.</b>

13:39.650 --> 13:40.960
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

13:41.640 --> 13:43.730
<b><i>The bleeding won't stop.</i></b>

13:43.730 --> 13:46.150
<b><i>These fleas are more than just big bugs...</i></b>

13:47.290 --> 13:52.220
<b>Area P-9, Y-7, X-8, Z-4.</b>

13:52.220 --> 13:57.090
<b>Point Y-5, X-3, Z-1.</b>

13:57.090 --> 13:58.400
<b>Okay.</b>

14:14.880 --> 14:18.140
<b><i>The sniper isn't trying to deal serious damage.</i></b>

14:18.140 --> 14:22.670
<b><i>The real goal is to exhaust my 
strength through blood loss!</i></b>

14:27.720 --> 14:33.930
<b>My fleas are very special...</b>

14:35.260 --> 14:38.430
<b>They have a 200-meter vertical leap.</b>

14:40.080 --> 14:42.690
<b>And when you factor in...</b>

14:46.390 --> 14:50.690
<b>my air gun's power,</b>

14:50.690 --> 14:55.120
<b>they become unstoppable, oh yeah.</b>

14:57.660 --> 15:00.150
<b>Oh? He's already able to dodge them?</b>

15:00.150 --> 15:03.260
<b>No wonder those apes couldn't do anything.</b>

15:05.330 --> 15:09.850
<b><i>If I keep running around, it'll be 
harder for them to snipe me!</i></b>

15:09.850 --> 15:12.890
<b><i>But I have to conserve stamina.</i></b>

15:19.420 --> 15:21.590
<b>Ah, he's going to try something.</b>

15:22.210 --> 15:24.830
<b>He may try to use his power.</b>

15:25.720 --> 15:28.240
<b>Let's see what he can do.</b>

15:28.550 --> 15:29.970
<b>Okay.</b>

15:41.400 --> 15:45.410
<b>My Super Eye allows me to observe a target</b>

15:45.410 --> 15:48.710
<b>from multiple angles via my Satellite Dragonflies.</b>

15:48.710 --> 15:51.430
<b>No ability you use can escape my sight.</b>

15:52.110 --> 15:54.450
<b>Now, let's see what you do.</b>

16:08.310 --> 16:10.520
<b>Killua cannot use <i>En</i>.</b>

16:10.990 --> 16:16.280
<b>Expanding his aura around him 
and maintaining it for a long time</b>

16:16.280 --> 16:18.230
<b>is by no means his forte.</b>

16:19.300 --> 16:21.520
<b>Killua knows this shortcoming.</b>

16:21.970 --> 16:25.700
<b>And so, he keeps his aura within 
the range he can best manage.</b>

16:26.130 --> 16:28.360
<b>A mere fifty-seven centimeters from his body.</b>

16:28.360 --> 16:29.340
<b>Not much room to work with.</b>

16:31.260 --> 16:36.970
<b>In other words, the moment a projectile is 
within fifty-seven centimeters of his body,</b>

16:37.330 --> 16:40.500
<b>Killua must rely on his incredible reflexes</b>

16:40.500 --> 16:44.060
<b>and physical strength to react 
with desperate speed,</b>

16:44.060 --> 16:45.760
<b>and dodge at point-blank range.</b>

16:49.860 --> 16:52.860
<b>But this time, he didn't dodge!</b>

16:54.500 --> 16:57.620
<b>All to determine the angle of 
the projectile's approach.</b>

16:59.200 --> 17:01.910
<b><i>Damn... It came from this way!</i></b>

17:06.240 --> 17:10.880
<b>He let himself be hit, so he 
could locate the sniper.</b>

17:11.410 --> 17:14.310
<b>The target is quickly heading your way.</b>

17:14.990 --> 17:16.390
<b>Okay.</b>

17:17.090 --> 17:21.640
<b>I somewhat expected this.</b>

17:23.760 --> 17:26.980
<b><i>The bleeding's stopped anywhere 
that the fleas only scratched me.</i></b>

17:28.260 --> 17:32.320
<b><i>They must secrete some chemical that 
stops blood from clotting naturally.</i></b>

17:33.280 --> 17:36.440
<b><i>If I start bleeding in too many 
places, I'll be in trouble.</i></b>

17:36.440 --> 17:37.910
<b><i>I can't let him escape!</i></b>

17:42.830 --> 17:44.230
<b><i>This is perfect.</i></b>

17:44.230 --> 17:47.240
<b><i>I can see clearly in every direction.</i></b>

17:48.960 --> 17:50.130
<b>How do you like this?</b>

17:50.130 --> 17:51.670
<b>There's nowhere for you to hide!</b>

17:52.190 --> 17:53.670
<b>Bring it on!</b>

18:05.250 --> 18:06.340
<b>Wait!</b>

18:08.090 --> 18:11.060
<b>This desert is massive.</b>

18:11.060 --> 18:14.100
<b>If you don't have any water, 
you'll die of thirst in a day.</b>

18:21.670 --> 18:23.350
<b>Too bad...</b>

18:23.350 --> 18:26.390
<b>I wanted to observe you a little longer,</b>

18:26.390 --> 18:28.170
<b>but I guess that won't work.</b>

18:28.170 --> 18:30.960
<b>I was running low on stamina, anyway.</b>

18:30.960 --> 18:34.480
<b>I suppose this gives us more 
time to talk things over...</b>

18:35.000 --> 18:37.060
<b>Let's begin with introductions.</b>

18:38.530 --> 18:42.430
<b>My name is Jail... 
Scratch that, it's Meleoron.</b>

18:42.790 --> 18:46.020
<b>When the Queen was still alive, 
I was a Squadron Leader.</b>

18:46.020 --> 18:47.420
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

18:48.110 --> 18:49.690
<b>What's your name?</b>

18:51.260 --> 18:52.940
<b>Why were you following me?</b>

18:53.570 --> 18:56.100
<b>Because I didn't want to let you get away.</b>

18:56.100 --> 18:58.450
<b>And I certainly couldn't let you die...</b>

18:59.180 --> 19:02.450
<b>Because you'll be a valuable partner.</b>

19:04.680 --> 19:06.860
<b>You have business with the King, right?</b>

19:06.860 --> 19:07.870
<b>I do not!</b>

19:07.870 --> 19:08.520
<b>Huh?</b>

19:10.170 --> 19:11.960
<b><i>That was dangerous...</i></b>

19:11.960 --> 19:14.710
<b><i>He must have a reason for approaching me.</i></b>

19:14.710 --> 19:16.090
<b><i>I can't tell him anything.</i></b>

19:16.950 --> 19:21.400
<b>Really? Aren't you guys here to defeat the King?</b>

19:21.400 --> 19:22.550
<b>"You guys"?</b>

19:24.310 --> 19:29.720
<b>Yep... I've been watching you since 
that other kid was with you.</b>

19:30.300 --> 19:31.230
<b>I understand.</b>

19:33.110 --> 19:37.440
<b>And you felt that I would put up 
less of a fight than Killua!</b>

19:37.440 --> 19:39.150
<b>Huh? Eh?!</b>

19:39.150 --> 19:40.540
<b>You've got it all wrong!</b>

19:40.540 --> 19:42.360
<b>That's how you interpret it?</b>

19:42.630 --> 19:44.730
<b>I guess it makes sense...</b>

19:44.730 --> 19:48.190
<b>To you, I'd look like an enemy.</b>

19:48.190 --> 19:50.880
<b>I guess I should clear up the misunderstanding first.</b>

19:51.330 --> 19:52.120
<b>Listen up.</b>

19:52.120 --> 19:54.130
<b>I swear that I'm not lying.</b>

19:54.130 --> 19:57.630
<b>I'm not looking to trick or defeat you!</b>

19:58.080 --> 19:59.880
<b>Okay, I believe you.</b>

19:59.880 --> 20:02.950
<b>Of course... It's hard to believe!</b>

20:02.950 --> 20:04.520
<b>I can sympathize.</b>

20:04.520 --> 20:07.550
<b>If I were in your shoes...</b>

20:08.370 --> 20:09.270
<b>Eh?</b>

20:13.610 --> 20:14.810
<b><i>Is that him?</i></b>

20:31.140 --> 20:33.160
<b>This is a trap.</b>

20:33.160 --> 20:36.510
<b>You still wanna come?</b>

20:40.470 --> 20:41.730
<b>Couldn't care less.</b>

20:41.730 --> 20:42.600
<b>Die.</b>

20:43.170 --> 20:45.790
<b>He instantly acted to kill me...</b>

20:45.790 --> 20:47.420
<b>No hesitation at all.</b>

20:47.420 --> 20:49.000
<b>I'm impressed!</b>

20:53.100 --> 20:54.150
<b><i>An underground lake?</i></b>

20:54.760 --> 20:56.360
<b>Lookin' for a taste of hell?</b>

20:56.830 --> 20:59.080
<b>Here you go!</b>

21:03.650 --> 21:04.250
<b>Blood!</b>

21:04.250 --> 21:05.250
<b>Food!</b>

21:05.250 --> 21:06.870
<b>It's food!</b>

21:09.960 --> 21:11.620
<b>Wait, this is...</b>

21:12.110 --> 21:14.550
<b>Captain Ikalgo's host!</b>

21:15.500 --> 21:17.750
<b>Crap, stop eating it.</b>

21:18.100 --> 21:20.640
<b>I want to stop, but I can't...</b>

21:20.640 --> 21:25.260
<b>The blood is calling to us!</b>

21:27.180 --> 21:28.010
<b>Bastard!</b>

21:28.350 --> 21:34.270
<b>How dare you chop off my precious legs?!</b>

21:35.320 --> 21:38.400
<b>I couldn't let you drag me into the water.</b>

21:38.790 --> 21:40.650
<b>These suction cups saved me.</b>

21:41.120 --> 21:43.780
<b>Anyway, aren't you an octopus?</b>

21:44.300 --> 21:46.530
<b>Don't call me an octopus!</b>

21:50.320 --> 21:53.660
<b>Killua's opponent turns out to be Ikalgo,</b>

21:53.660 --> 21:56.950
<b>a parasitic Chimera Ant, resembling 
an octopus, that uses human hosts.</b>

21:57.280 --> 22:00.920
<b>Don't call me an octopus!</b>

23:25.500 --> 23:28.110
<b>Next time: Ikalgo x And x Lightning.</b>

23:28.110 --> 23:31.020
<b>What has eight legs and lives in the ocean?</b>

23:31.020 --> 23:31.750
<b>An octopus.</b>

23:31.750 --> 23:33.790
<b>Don't call me an octopus!</b>
