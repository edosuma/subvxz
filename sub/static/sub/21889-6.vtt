Ooh! And chopped scallions and Jack cheese
sprinkled on top, not melted inside.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.366
Just a hard-boiled egg for me.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.995
The key with this cook is
to keep it simple.

You know this isn't
actually a restaurant, right?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.627

made that clear.

what just happened.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.842
A bird flew into the window,
and he dropped right at my feet.

I thought he was dead,
but then I heard a little, "Cheep, cheep."

01:51.736 --> 01:53.571
Doesn't look like anything's broken.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.240
I think he was just stunned.

you rescued that little guy.

Why don't you come to the pet clinic
with me after summer school today?

02:50.670 --> 02:53.381
You could be my assistant.
You could see how we do things.

Oh! Wasn't that a beautiful moment?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.944
It'd be more beautiful with

Why are you acting like this?

13:13.792 --> 13:16.879
Because when your father built you
such a beautiful room,

13:17.379 --> 13:20.341
I was afraid you'd start spending
all your time over there.

13:21.258 --> 13:24.762

if Ramona spent more time with me,
