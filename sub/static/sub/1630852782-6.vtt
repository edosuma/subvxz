00:22.656 --> 00:24.392
<i>Previously on</i> Force...

00:24.425 --> 00:25.593
Where you get this from?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.128
Wrong question.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.196
- How much?
- Right question.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.798
You know you're
the only Flynn I fuck with.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.733
You got that big
fucking Flynn name

00:32.767 --> 00:34.235
but no distro.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.337
<i>You come to me with this,</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:38.305
<i>you better hope
I'm your motherfucker.</i>

00:38.339 --> 00:39.774
It's finer than coke.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.775
You think you can
break this shit down,

00:40.808 --> 00:42.309
see what the fuck we got?

00:42.343 --> 00:43.444
Damn!

00:43.477 --> 00:45.413
Aah!

00:45.446 --> 00:47.081
Where is Tommy Egan?

00:47.114 --> 00:49.083
- Where's she at?
- <i>Which doesn't quite</i>

00:49.116 --> 00:51.051
make us even after all
the bodies that have fallen.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.219
Get down!

00:53.421 --> 00:54.522
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

00:54.555 --> 00:57.158
It went straight through.
It's clean. Goddamn.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.059
<i>You're gonna be all right.</i>

00:59.093 --> 01:00.428
The money that I owe you

01:00.461 --> 01:02.163
<i>has got nothing to do
with Vic and me.</i>

01:02.196 --> 01:04.231
This face
is not the face

01:04.265 --> 01:06.167
that my son's
going to wake up to.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.535
<i>Maybe you should
just sit down, Walter.</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:08.836
He's been quiet
for a while now.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.438
He's getting ready
to make a big move.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.173
<i>So we need
to get inside.</i>

01:12.206 --> 01:13.407
<i>And that's our way.</i>

01:13.441 --> 01:14.642
What would a deal look like?

01:14.675 --> 01:16.444
<i>Would look like
me running point</i>

01:16.477 --> 01:18.846
- and takin' 70%.
- 60-40.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.581
Ain't nobody
Black or white dumb enough

01:20.614 --> 01:21.715
to fuck with the Serbs.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.783
They haven't done it

01:22.817 --> 01:24.385
because they haven't
had the numbers.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.086
<i>You thought this shit
all the way through?</i>

01:26.120 --> 01:28.656
It's fucking CBI,
who I'm good with.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.292
<i>You all stay ready
in case I gotta call y'all up.</i>

01:31.325 --> 01:32.460
You stay close.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.770
Fucker!

01:42.803 --> 01:44.805
Sh--hold on, E.

01:44.839 --> 01:47.508
You're the only one
who knows how to cook Dahlia.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.310
<i>What the fuck
do you mean?</i>

01:49.343 --> 01:50.711
<i>Is there a problem, babe?</i>

01:50.744 --> 01:52.413
Our drums of Dahlia
were stolen.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.449
We have no product.
I'm going to your father.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.825
Never really thought
about what happens

03:44.858 --> 03:46.260
after you kill someone.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.362
Only two things need to happen.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.831
You don't get caught,
and they don't get found.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.468
So how many?

03:54.501 --> 03:57.371
Don't matter.
Same two rules always apply.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.474
Look, if you wanna go
all the way in this gang,

04:00.507 --> 04:02.776
this shit come
with the territory.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.678
And come on,
we gotta keep moving.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.348
We racin' against the light.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.751
- She was an orphan.
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

04:10.784 --> 04:12.453
Then ain't nobody
gonna miss her.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.790
You wanna say any last words?

04:16.824 --> 04:20.628
I don't really know
what to say.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.730
Say goodbye.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.734
Goodbye.

04:35.609 --> 04:39.847
Another senseless death

04:39.880 --> 04:42.383
<i>in the city
plagued by violence.</i>

04:42.416 --> 04:45.986
<i>Another young Black man</i>

04:46.020 --> 04:47.955
<i>taken too soon.</i>

04:47.988 --> 04:51.291
<i>May Elijah Linden
rest eternally</i>

04:51.325 --> 04:53.527
in the arms of our angels.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.833
Yea...

04:59.867 --> 05:01.935
<i>though I walk through
the valley</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:03.871
<i>of the shadow of death,</i>

05:03.904 --> 05:06.607
You know that nigga wouldn't
be in this fucking box

05:06.640 --> 05:09.043
right now
if it weren't for Tommy, right?

05:09.076 --> 05:12.513
We all agreed
on the move, all of us.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.649
Now show some respect.

05:15.683 --> 05:19.386
Amen.

05:45.079 --> 05:47.715
Simon...

05:47.748 --> 05:51.018
was a north side
White Sox fan,

05:51.051 --> 05:53.120
crazy son of a bitch.

05:54.088 --> 05:57.591
But he had a heart of gold.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.666
May he be in heaven
a full half hour

06:05.699 --> 06:08.702
before the devil
knows he's dead.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.905
To Simon.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.644
You okay?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.947
Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.783
You've had that cough
for a minute now.

06:22.816 --> 06:26.053
I know--you know,
as soon as the weather changes,

06:26.086 --> 06:28.122
I'll be good as gold.

06:28.155 --> 06:32.826
Jesus Christ, this is a good
turn out for Simon, isn't it?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.796
<i>I should go talk to him.</i>

06:35.829 --> 06:39.433
No, no, no, no.
Let me.

06:39.466 --> 06:42.603
A son needs
his father's shoulder.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.018
You were childhood friends

06:58.051 --> 07:00.888
since you were
three years old...

07:03.023 --> 07:05.459
...and he's lying
in that fuckin' box

07:05.492 --> 07:08.996
because of the stupid fuckin'
decisions that you made.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.134
He's not coming back from that.

07:14.168 --> 07:17.437
So whatever you're into,
I hope you can.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.883
You need to make
things right with him.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.984
It's a two-way street.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.152
If you're making
moves without him,

07:32.186 --> 07:33.854
- he feels betrayed--
- I'm not making moves.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.522
Okay, Vic.
Whatever you're doing is--

07:35.556 --> 07:37.191
Hey, how 'bout I go in
on that little side hustle

07:37.224 --> 07:38.892
- you tried to bring me in on?
- Too late.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.627
The opportunity's long gone.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.196
You were right.
Designer shit.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.931
Came and went.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.601
- I think he's sick.
- Bronchitis.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.636
Every year, same shit.
You're overreacting.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.041
Death comes for us all, huh?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.945
But not yours, not today.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.816
Hey...

08:02.850 --> 08:05.252
...there's still hope
for your son.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.855
Believe that.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.664
You're not exactly
racking up allies.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.166
It's cost of war.
Price of doing business.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.603
No, fuck that.
We both buried on our side.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.638
Who the fuck
you drop a rose for?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.173
Why are you acting like

08:26.206 --> 08:28.075
this the first time
you ever made a big play?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.142
You need to back the fuck up.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.511
Maybe you just
sat the fuck back,

08:31.545 --> 08:33.714
inherited your
big brother's business

08:33.747 --> 08:34.915
and acted like you
stacked chips.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.149
Yo, that's the fuck enough.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.018
No, this is
who the fuck we are!

08:38.051 --> 08:39.720
We all went in there eyes open.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.188
Maybe so,
but we've been talking.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.956
Oh, that's some
funny shit right there,

08:42.990 --> 08:44.124
'cause last time I checked,

08:44.157 --> 08:46.560
we was all equal
on decisions or talking.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.062
We don't have the appetite
for a long war with the Serbs.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.197
We paid too high of a price.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.598
They ain't here now!

08:51.632 --> 08:53.967
<i>We got product,</i>

08:54.001 --> 08:55.569
and now
we got they pipeline.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.904
Look, we already voted,
so we gonna--

08:56.937 --> 08:58.872
You know what?
I already know. Voted.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.841
<i>You bad for business.</i>

09:02.843 --> 09:05.245
A'ight?
Bad for the city.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.881
So that's it?

09:09.816 --> 09:11.551
That's it.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.990
Tch. All right.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.059
You know, I guess
honor amongst thieves

09:19.092 --> 09:20.761
is short-lived, huh,
motherfucker?

09:20.794 --> 09:23.797
To make you whole,
we'll buy the coke you got.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.732
All of it.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.167
All right.
Ten keys.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.835
I want 38 apiece.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.737
Get the fuck outta here. Thirty.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.272
Thirty-eight.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.575
Deal.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.682
All right. Deal.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.850
Y'all like
the dynamic trio now?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.152
- No.
- No, we're goin'

09:45.185 --> 09:46.353
our separate ways.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.121
We'll make arrangement
for the pickup.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.724
Good, let's get this
the fuck over with.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.670
It's not too late
to still make this work.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.772
Too much heat
if we stay together.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.041
Look, man,
you got a real shot

10:08.075 --> 10:09.743
to be your own man on this one.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.678
Not your old man.
Take it.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.649
Trying.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.618
Are we good no matter?

10:18.652 --> 10:22.189
Long as your snow
don't blow south, we all good.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.398
Got the city all cut up?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.400
I thought I did.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.170
Whatever mine stays mine.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.039
Good luck moving your weight.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.975
See you on the other side.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.343
I'll be waitin'.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.782
What'chu gonna do
with your half?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.151
I'ma reinvest in Dahlia.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.388
Something I should get down on?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.056
You got a fresh
bullet hole in you

10:56.089 --> 10:57.758
and you already talkin'
about making moves?

10:57.791 --> 11:00.127
I ain't gonna
sit here licking my wounds

11:00.160 --> 11:02.162
and miss an opportunity.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.100
Don't fucking touch it.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.702
If that shit get infected,

11:08.735 --> 11:10.103
I ain't taking you
to the hospital

11:10.137 --> 11:11.438
if the whole fuckin' arm
turn green.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.040
At that point,
it'll probably just fall off

11:13.073 --> 11:15.142
like some <i>barbacoa.</i>

11:16.910 --> 11:19.179
Yeah.
Let's make this shit work.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.248
You sure?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.316
Ain't no guarantee return
on your investment.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.918
Never is.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.854
Dead money don't make money.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.057
All right then.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.126
<i>Here, keep that.
Rainy day fund.</i>

11:33.160 --> 11:34.261
You invested.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.303
<i>So how're we
gonna move Dahlia</i>

11:43.336 --> 11:45.906
without people
finding out who we are?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.042
We're gonna do locker drops.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.314
Public lockers,
convention center,

11:54.347 --> 11:56.049
people moving in and out,

11:56.083 --> 11:57.818
easy to hide in plain sight.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.120
It's a good system, central.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.722
I been doin'
this shit forever.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.158
Just feels kind of low rent.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.261
Dahlia's fashionable.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.464
We about selling drugs
or mu'fucking purses?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.232
- This is high-end.
- <i>You know who go</i>

12:12.265 --> 12:13.500
<i>- to conventions?</i>
- Who?

12:13.733 --> 12:16.837
People with expense accounts
and money to burn.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.072
Hedge fund guys, housewives,

12:19.106 --> 12:20.207
and socialites just like you.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.508
Point made.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.143
The people I got in mind
for this distro

12:23.176 --> 12:24.744
is gonna get texts.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.513
<i>We'll give 'em the time
and location for the invite.</i>

12:26.746 --> 12:28.849
How can you be sure
no one will try and fuck us?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.250
You can't.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.285
But anybody
that fuck with protocol,

12:32.319 --> 12:33.753
that's a wrap.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.056
One and done.
Ain't no second chances.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.961
I've just got
one non-negotiable term.

12:40.994 --> 12:44.064
Everything negotiable.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.867
My family's distro
doesn't get near this.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.870
I think Walter could handle
a little competition.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.873
This stays off my father's
and my brother's radar.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.407
Ain't gonna be
that way for long.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.776
Long enough for it
to be my move.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.112
All right, bet.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.214
Until you wanna come out
into the light,

13:01.248 --> 13:02.782
I'll run point.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.518
Liliana could help.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.053
- Who?
- Liliana--she good people.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.189
She used to run for me.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.324
She got worked over
by the Serbs.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.861
She took a bullet
and she didn't break.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.398
She never gave me up.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.403
She had my back.
We need her.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.839
My good friend
Reggie's already on board.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.177
What the fuck is you
talking about already on board?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.913
Don't nobody get to skip
to the front of the line.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.214
We go way back.
I trust him.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.883
Trust ain't even
in your vocabulary right now.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.518
Oh, but you trust Liliana?

13:38.552 --> 13:39.953
Yeah.
She different.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.255
How is she different?

13:42.289 --> 13:44.224
She ain't distro.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.092
She on our side, a hun'ed.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.930
Everyone else we invite
gotta start at step one.

13:58.572 --> 13:59.873
Hi, Da.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.578
On my way.

14:09.249 --> 14:12.285
Our patients cannot be
disturbed during the dialysis.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.853
Then they should have chosen

14:13.887 --> 14:15.555
a better fucking dialysis
center that's not a front.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.090
Fuck you.
This is a legit business.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.391
You've said that.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.360
All you need to do
is produce a shipping manifest.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.628
Do you think
I'm stupid enough

14:21.861 --> 14:23.396
to bring something
illegal here?

14:23.430 --> 14:25.532
Al Capone went away
for tax evasion, motherfucker.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.201
That's a fascinating
little bit of information.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.238
Get the fuck out my way.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.916
Fuck.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.525
Still waiting on
them documents, Mr. Flynn.

14:52.559 --> 14:56.129
And I'm waiting
on due fucking notice.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.632
But here you fucking are.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.033
Time's running out.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.668
You need to produce
the proper paperwork.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.670
I fuckin' heard you!

15:03.903 --> 15:05.105
Hello.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.310
- Where have you been?
- Running errands.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.412
It'll just be a minute.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.389
Are you mad I wasn't here

15:22.422 --> 15:24.424
or because you don't know
how to do what I do?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.027
Both.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.265
Okay, here's
the receipts and freight bill

15:32.299 --> 15:36.303
for every pill and dropper
to come through these doors.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.705
Would you like duplicates?

15:40.373 --> 15:41.474
Matches up.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.243
This time.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.278
Good.
Now take it, file it,

15:45.312 --> 15:47.280
and please... get the fuck out.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.683
And if you wanna try
and build a case against me,

15:49.716 --> 15:53.687
next time bring some
fuckin' evidence to the table.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.525
We're all set here.

16:05.532 --> 16:09.302
This today
is why you're not ready.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.339
I've had the Feds here

16:12.372 --> 16:15.608
<i>and you are
nowhere to be found.</i>

16:15.642 --> 16:17.477
You say you wanna step up?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.417
That-that-that's fucking great.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.320
So step the fuck up.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.728
I ain't gonna lie, bro.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.396
It took you a little minute,

16:36.429 --> 16:38.098
but you finally got
your head right.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.233
Look, the only thing
that nigga Tommy ever brought

16:40.266 --> 16:41.735
was bullshit.
Come on.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.704
Tommy's also the one who opened
up the Serb's pipeline.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.407
Whatever, and got E killed
in the process--come on.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.309
We knew the risk.
We knew what was at stake.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.211
Nah, look, look, come on,
big bro, listen to me.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.413
I know you got a soft spot
for white boys, all right?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.448
- Ah--I know.
- Okay, all right.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.417
But now that we got
this shit on lock,

16:57.450 --> 17:00.387
we gotta make a move, man.
We gotta make it quick.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.256
<i>Okay?
Now the Serbs are gone, but...</i>

17:03.289 --> 17:05.225
Mirkovic's gonna circle back.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.460
Bet. <i>- I'm talking about</i>

17:07.494 --> 17:09.496
with both hands out
and stuff.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.030
Gun in one hand,

17:11.064 --> 17:12.699
looking to get paid
in the other.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.368
Mm-hmm. And shit,
we can't go at 'em again.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.171
That play already been called.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.273
<i>That's what I say we do:</i>

17:20.306 --> 17:22.442
take 10% of everything
we make

17:22.475 --> 17:24.277
and we put that shit
in the escrow account, nigga,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.479
for them--
we don't touch it.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.481
As a insurance.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.518
Yup, you pretend that
money ain't even there, bro.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.153
The shit gone.
It ain't ours.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.289
That's all Serb cash for
whenever they come back.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.824
So when Mirkovic pulls up,

17:38.057 --> 17:39.492
we pay him his tax.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.694
And we ain't got no problems.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.264
See, now you thinkin'.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.065
Come through, baby bro.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.301
Come on, man,
I'm telling you, a'ight?

17:48.334 --> 17:50.270
<i>Look, me and you, D,</i>

17:50.303 --> 17:53.406
we got this, a'ight?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.408
CBI is everything, bro.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.411
<i>We don't need nobody else.</i>

18:00.547 --> 18:02.615
Walter.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.286
Walter!

18:09.155 --> 18:11.491
What the fuck happened?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.667
Fuck off.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.204
What the fuck happened,
Walter?

18:24.237 --> 18:27.273
I didn't eat fuck
all the day, then...

18:27.307 --> 18:28.741
I don't know.
Head spins.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.810
Lightheaded,
fell on my fuckin' arse.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.212
Your head's bleeding.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.617
Get me a fucking bandage.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.688
You should see a doctor,
Walter--don't fuck around.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.890
Fuck, it's a bit o' blood!

18:44.123 --> 18:45.625
I ain't talkin'
about your head,

18:45.658 --> 18:47.627
you stubborn prick.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.364
You think you can
hide this from me?

18:51.397 --> 18:53.600
I see everything.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.768
You gotta let the kids know.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.673
It ain't right to let them
go through this twice.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.544
You shut the fuck up.

19:12.318 --> 19:16.523
Everything that you
fuckin' see here

19:16.556 --> 19:19.759
isn't fuckin' real.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.541
What's cracking, bro?

19:36.309 --> 19:39.178
Look, I got a job for you.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.647
Speak.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.382
It's about that nigga Tommy.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.783
Who?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.386
The white motherfucker
from the barber shop.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.289
Oh, okay.
What you need?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.658
I need you to take
this five for now.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.692
A nickel?

19:52.725 --> 19:54.928
Get the fuck
outta here, nigga.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.463
Y'all ain't finna catch a body
for no less than a dime.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.366
No, no, no.
No guns.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.634
Not yet.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.469
I just want you to watch
the motherfucker,

20:03.503 --> 20:05.371
then report back--
that's it.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.906
So you want me
to babysit this motherfucker?

20:06.940 --> 20:08.942
For five thousand dollars,
you the highest paid babysitter

20:08.975 --> 20:10.577
in Chicago, motherfucker.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.211
You want the job or not?
I ain't got time

20:12.245 --> 20:14.547
- for this shit for real.
- Hell yeah.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.582
Fuck.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.950
Just do what I said, man,
a'ight?

20:16.983 --> 20:18.651
Gather the information,
report back.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.520
If you can't do that,
just run me my shit.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.955
Hey, all right,
all right, chill.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.625
Look, I ain't say
I wasn't gonna do it,

20:25.658 --> 20:29.963
but if you change your mind,
I'm gonna want that other five.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.297
Hmm.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.665
Yeah, I hear you.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.767
- All right.
- All right.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.555
<i>You sure this is
the best place to launch?</i>

20:55.588 --> 20:58.491
Don't worry.
Being poor ain't contagious.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.826
Don't be an asshole.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.394
Be honest with me.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.429
You ever take public
transportation in your life?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.264
Like a bus or a train?

21:05.298 --> 21:07.000
- No, no, cabs don't count.
- Wow.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.936
Life musta looked
real nice from that backseat.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.404
You know, I don't think
this will help my case,

21:11.437 --> 21:13.873
but I did backpack
through Europe when I was 17.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.876
Took the Eurorail every day.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.378
That shit go that far?

21:18.411 --> 21:19.812
I thought it only went
through the what's its name?

21:19.846 --> 21:20.813
Disney World.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.850
That's a monorail. Jesus.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.551
Well,
I ain't never been there.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.287
Eh...
you'd like it.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.989
The song "It's A Small World"
fucks with your brain

21:30.023 --> 21:31.391
and stays with you forever.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.626
Oh, literally
the worst song ever.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.796
Hey, what's up
with the guy in the khakis?

21:36.829 --> 21:39.332
You're describing
like 60% of the people.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.900
No, the cargo pants.
Three o'clock.

21:40.933 --> 21:43.336
Rent-A-Cop
flirting with the girl

21:43.369 --> 21:45.038
by the north elevator.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.506
Hang on, hang on.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.542
Yeah, no,
he-he don't work here.

21:49.575 --> 21:50.910
Turn back to the left.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.546
What's up with old boy
that's at the nest?

21:53.579 --> 21:54.947
<i>He just grabbed
a cup of coffee.</i>

21:54.981 --> 21:56.349
He checking in or out?

21:56.382 --> 21:59.552
In.
He's on his way to his post.

21:59.585 --> 22:03.823
Cops are present...
but minimal.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.794
Cameras avoidable.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.630
Lockers are prime
and accessible.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.767
You see that shit?
That's what I'm talking about.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.502
Anybody could walk
through there,

22:16.536 --> 22:19.338
connect, distro, or a drop.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.007
Yeah.
Liliana can walk through there.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.509
I can walk through there.
You?

22:23.543 --> 22:25.678
You're the poster boy
for New York drug dealers.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.947
The fuck you know about me?

22:33.386 --> 22:35.755

in suits back in the day,

24:02.575 --> 24:05.545
throw 'em off my scent.
I clean up real nice.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.114
Okay.
You look fucking good.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.582
And my partner back
in New York,

24:09.615 --> 24:11.751
he used to rock
these custom cuts every day.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.021
Well, I hope some of whatever
he had rubbed off on you.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.723
Yeah. I hope
some of it did too.

24:21.928 --> 24:25.464
So what do we know
about these Serbs?

24:25.498 --> 24:26.933
Lotta talk.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.203
No one wants to
claim the hits yet.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.573
Soon as the smoke clears,
names'll start dropping.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.909
Better names
than more bodies.

24:36.943 --> 24:40.146
They ain't gonna be
mutually exclusive.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.157
Yeah, I could do that.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.496
Gimme a hour.

25:13.546 --> 25:14.780
<i>Oye.</i>

25:14.814 --> 25:16.916
Nice ride.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.754
Do you need something? What can I do
for you?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.956
Nothing, Sister.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.292
It's what I can do for you.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.527
You know where you are?

25:28.794 --> 25:31.264
I do... I also know where you are going.

25:31.597 --> 25:34.567
Yo! Watch it. You're throwing a lotta
attitude around.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.636
I hope she got the goods to back it up.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.104
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.

25:38.571 --> 25:39.171
What's your name?

25:39.205 --> 25:40.806
My name is Fuck Your Mother.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.708
No more questions.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.744
You're on the clock.

25:56.255 --> 25:59.892
Hey, you got any latkes
in that bag, Moishe?

26:01.093 --> 26:03.095
It's the wrong time of year.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.130
You know, I like the ones

26:04.163 --> 26:06.065
with the little carrots
in them.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.301
Oh no, no.
That's not a latke.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.969
That's garbage.

26:10.002 --> 26:13.639
Potato, onion--anything else
might as well be a frittata.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.042
I assume that's for me?

26:17.143 --> 26:18.177
Yep.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.578
What is it?

26:19.612 --> 26:22.048
Something from a new
friend you're gonna like.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.317
An early Hanukkah present.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.752
Oh, again,
<i>shayne punim,</i>

26:26.786 --> 26:28.287
wrong time of the year.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.756
Never the wrong time
for this, Moishe.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.027
Okay.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.925
Who the fuck
keeps blowing you up?

27:05.958 --> 27:08.661
Reggie.
He wants a re-up.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.062
<i>No.</i>

27:10.096 --> 27:11.998
Ain't nobody getting shit
till we get set up.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.767
- Put him back.
- He can be a distro for us.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.136
He move real weight?

27:17.169 --> 27:18.938
No, but he has connections.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.239
Then he's a customer.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.108
- And these people you got?
- Hitters.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.076
How do you know that?

27:24.110 --> 27:25.778
Because this is what I do.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.347
This is all I ever been about.
I can read people.

27:28.381 --> 27:30.316
I know within like 15 seconds
of meeting somebody

27:30.349 --> 27:31.917
if I'm gonna fuck
with them or not.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.252
You knew that about me?

27:33.285 --> 27:35.187
I knew it in ten.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.424
Don't let that shit
go to your head.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.860
But yeah.
Fuck Reggie.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.795
He ain't getting shit.
Ghost him.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.133
Oh, shit.

28:24.303 --> 28:27.039
This gonna be fire.

28:28.441 --> 28:31.811
Fuck me.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.246
Are you kidding?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.999
I know who you are.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.502
What, are you
fucking traffic cops now too?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.270
Oh, take it easy, Paulie.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.505
This doesn't have
to be contentious.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.040
Don't it?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.741
You still got some runway.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.510
You can play ball.
Make things easy on yourself.

29:04.743 --> 29:05.978
Your lips keep movin',

29:06.011 --> 29:07.847
but all I'm hearing
is fucking bullshit.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.982
How long you gonna cover
for your brother-in-law?

29:10.015 --> 29:11.984
You got nothing on him.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.786
We got 26 years
of shit on you.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.888
What makes you think
if Walter goes down,

29:15.921 --> 29:17.256
he's not dragging you
with him?

29:19.925 --> 29:22.928
That motherfucker floats.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.764
You need a big fucking torpedo
to sink him.

29:25.798 --> 29:29.301
And it ain't gonna be me.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.014
Where the fuck
was your sister today?

29:42.047 --> 29:45.117
How should I know?
What happened to your head?

29:45.151 --> 29:48.988
Got fucked with
by a kitchen cabinet.

29:49.021 --> 29:53.225
I need you to find out
what your sister's been doing.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.927
Not my job.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.863
So are we gonna do Sunday
dinner here or at Claud's?

29:57.897 --> 29:59.999
What the fuck has dinner

30:00.032 --> 30:03.469
got to do
with this conversation?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.504
I need you to find out

30:05.538 --> 30:09.008
what your sister
was up to today.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.477
Dad, I'm bringing Gloria
to Sunday dinner.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.046
Well, son,

30:14.079 --> 30:15.814
I don't think
that's a great idea.

30:15.848 --> 30:19.418
You see, Sunday dinners
are for family only,

30:19.451 --> 30:22.922
always has been, always will.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.590
She's not welcome.

30:24.823 --> 30:28.227
She does not have a seat
at our table.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.934
Let's make sure we have
an extra place set.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.840
One, two, three.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.945
<i>Oh, okay.
Grab the plug, unplug it.</i>

30:45.978 --> 30:47.246
I got it.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.480
- <i>You got it?</i>
- Got it.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.848
<i>How about the gas?</i>

30:49.882 --> 30:51.083
Yeah, no, the gas is off.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.986
- Gas is off? All right.
- Gas is off.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.621
All right, get behind.
Can you get behind?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.056
Oh, yeah.
There we go.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.991
That's it,
one more push.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.496
Whoo.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.866
Man.
Thanks for the assist.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.935
- Yeah, no problem.
- You want a beer?

31:09.969 --> 31:11.503
Uh, yeah, sure.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.974
Here you go.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.509
Thank you.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.578
You're welcome.

31:19.612 --> 31:22.014
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:24.149 --> 31:25.651
Yo, JP.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.319
- What up?
- <i>This may not be</i>

31:27.353 --> 31:28.587
<i>none of my business</i>

31:28.621 --> 31:30.422
<i>so you could tell me
to fuck off, but...</i>

31:30.456 --> 31:33.626
how the fuck did you
get so far in over your head?

31:35.427 --> 31:38.397
Look, the shit started slow.

31:38.430 --> 31:42.167
Custody lawyers,
private investigators,

31:42.201 --> 31:46.071
uh, the club,
medical for my old man.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.473
That'll do it.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.408
<i>The hole just kept
getting deeper.</i>

31:49.441 --> 31:51.644
<i>I couldn't dig myself out
fast enough.</i>

31:51.677 --> 31:54.413
Never made enough to keep up.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.582
Now, you can tell me
to fuck off...

31:56.615 --> 31:58.250
Fuck off.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.152
But how you rolling
so deep?

32:00.185 --> 32:01.620
Yo, come on, man.

32:01.654 --> 32:05.357
I done told you
I was a businessman.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.395
Fuck this.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.929
I'm trying to have
a real moment with you.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.431
We're having
a real moment.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.700
No, you blowing rainbows
and sunshine up my ass.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.603
Well, you can't have
one without the other.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.438
What the fuck?

32:19.471 --> 32:22.341
I'm trying to keep it
a buck, motherfucker.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.676
The fuck are you into, Tommy?

32:23.709 --> 32:26.145
Why are you asking a question
you know the answer to?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.113
For some fucking peace
of mind bullshit?

32:28.147 --> 32:29.715
No, I just been fed
so many lies with this family.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.484
I just want
one goddamn truth.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.620
Well, if I tell you,
is that gonna change anything?

32:34.653 --> 32:36.255
No.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.992
I'm a drug dealer.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.528
How long?

32:42.561 --> 32:44.229
My whole life.
Well, not my whole life.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.432
I mean, I started out
slingin' pantyhose

32:46.465 --> 32:48.133
and socks on the corner,

32:48.167 --> 32:49.468
but I mean,
I always been a hustler.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.337
You know, when things
got real tight,

32:51.370 --> 32:53.072
- I used to move--
- Oh, no, fuck that,

32:53.105 --> 32:54.340
fuck that, and fuck you

32:54.373 --> 32:56.508
if you think
we're gonna get close on this.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.277
Just 'cause you moved some weed

32:58.310 --> 32:59.545
'cause you thought
it was cool...

32:59.578 --> 33:00.746
Oh no, no.
It wasn't just weed.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.281
Or whatever.
I don't give a fuck

33:02.314 --> 33:04.616
if you was the Tony Montana
of the Midwest,

33:04.650 --> 33:06.151
you ain't getting
near this shit.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.987
You ain't getting near my shit. Never.

33:09.021 --> 33:12.057
I just need to catch
a motherfucking break, man.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.225
Well, it ain't gonna be
with this.

33:13.258 --> 33:15.361
You heard me?

33:15.394 --> 33:16.995
I'll keep helping you out.

33:17.029 --> 33:20.332
Honestly, I-I don't need
no more fuckin' charity.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.234
I need to start
making some bread.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.379
<i>Shit, this Serb pipeline</i>

33:33.412 --> 33:34.780

<i>We printing money.</i>

33:36.315 --> 33:37.783
<i>It's flowing right now,</i>

33:38.016 --> 33:41.320
<i>but we need to lock it down
before Mirkovic comes callin'.</i>

33:41.353 --> 33:43.155
Yeah, you know, we never
really got to get down

33:43.188 --> 33:44.590
together like this.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.359
This shit feel
full circle though.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.695
<i>I told you, bro,
me and you together,</i>

33:49.728 --> 33:53.632
<i>unstoppable.
CBI gonna run this city.</i>

33:53.665 --> 33:56.568
How you know
I'd be able to pull it off?

33:58.404 --> 34:01.173
I was only 18 when you went in.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.508
I ain't know shit.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.309
Didn't have no real skin
in the game--none.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.345
<i>I knew
you could hold it down.</i>

34:08.447 --> 34:09.448
How?

34:10.682 --> 34:12.818
Why you ask so many
damn questions right now?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.420
I don't know.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.755
'Cause I ain't never
asked before, shit.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.593
I'm just saying like I was
on my way to the Ivy league,

34:21.627 --> 34:23.529
my nigga,
I'm talking about sweater vest

34:23.562 --> 34:25.564
and all that fly shit.
Come on, man.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.099
Get the fuck outta here.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.734
You wasn't gonna go
full Carlton.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.335
<i>Nah, nah, you right.</i>

34:30.369 --> 34:33.472
<i>I was gonna be decent though.
I don't know.</i>

34:33.505 --> 34:35.841
I guess what I'm trying
to say is, shit...

34:37.409 --> 34:40.145
There was other niggas in CBI

34:40.179 --> 34:43.282
who actually had seniority.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.417
Coulda passed the torch to them.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.454
Yeah, but none of 'em
had what you did.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.590
What's that?

34:53.725 --> 34:54.860
My blood.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.698
Yeah.
Think we good.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.538
Reggie's my friend, Tommy.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.540
Yeah, when you got
a product this good,

35:08.574 --> 35:10.542
you ain't got no friends,
only competition.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.345
Okay, well, no offense,
Liliana, you're great,

35:13.378 --> 35:16.381
but she has two feet in already
and I took your word for it.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.816
She got skin in the game.

35:17.850 --> 35:19.785
- I brought the connect.
- And we both dropping

35:19.818 --> 35:21.487
six figures towards production.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.890
If Reggie know you,
then he know me.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.493
And that's a problem.
Trust me on that.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.328
We all bringing
something to the party

35:29.361 --> 35:30.562
so we could stay.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.865
We don't want nothing--

35:34.733 --> 35:36.702
We don't want nothin'
fucking it up.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.807
Get a fuckin' burner.
Bring legit distro.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.310
And now, let's go get
that fuckin' cook.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.622
Fuck!

35:57.756 --> 36:00.526
Hi, Doc.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.164
Hey, bro, I don't want
that gig no more, fam.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.367
Hey, what the fuck do you mean
you don't want the gig no more?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.302
I mean you can keep
the cash and shit,

36:10.335 --> 36:11.837
but I ain't doing it no more,
a'ight?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.273
Find someone else
for the job or something.

36:14.306 --> 36:15.741
Nah, hold up, nigga.
What the fuck got you so shook?

36:15.774 --> 36:18.644
Find someone else for the job.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.692
I can't go into details,

36:33.725 --> 36:35.928
but I am putting distance
between me and my father.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.429
I also told him

36:37.462 --> 36:40.666
that you're coming to dinner
on Sunday night.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.401
I'm listening.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.369
I'm making my own moves.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.805
I don't wanna lose any
more time with this bullshit.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.808
Being with you again felt--

36:49.841 --> 36:51.243
Absolutely right?

36:51.276 --> 36:52.844
Yeah.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.517
So what is next?

36:58.550 --> 37:00.686
Whatever we want it to be.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.306
Hey, you good?
You good?

37:21.340 --> 37:22.574
Look at me, Gloria.
Look at me.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.810
We're okay.
We're okay.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.660
You're in my booth.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.929
I don't see your name on it.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.664
Look up.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.970
- Impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.538
Could have been
the next Tyson.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.474
No shit.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.876
I mean, that's not
really a selling point.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.711
Well, it was
a long time ago.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.680
You know, it seems like
only yesterday

38:01.713 --> 38:04.049
we saw him beat the shit
out of this Dago...

38:04.282 --> 38:05.684
- Goodbye, Rick.
- Heck--

38:13.992 --> 38:17.362
"My punches are just
as hard in Chicago

38:17.396 --> 38:18.997
as in New York."

38:19.031 --> 38:22.034
Sonny Liston.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.902
Are you a fight fan?

38:23.935 --> 38:26.638
Nope.
Just that fight.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.777
What...
you just gonna stand there,

38:31.810 --> 38:33.912
or do you wanna join me
in your booth?

38:44.523 --> 38:46.758
Breakfast for dinner.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.394
No, it's actually
breakfast for breakfast.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.396
My day's just getting started.

38:52.397 --> 38:53.665
So you a night owl?

38:53.699 --> 38:56.034
<i>Yeah.
You?</i>

38:56.068 --> 38:58.704
<i>I've been having
trouble sleeping.</i>

38:58.737 --> 38:59.905
New mattress.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.773
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

39:06.078 --> 39:07.546
You wanna--do you want a bite

39:07.579 --> 39:09.514
or are you
just gonna eye-eat it?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.952
My bad.

39:13.985 --> 39:17.923
It's just that Rick stole
my grandma's potato recipe.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.925
I didn't steal shit.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.361
She gave it to me...
after I gave it to her.

39:23.395 --> 39:25.130
Coulda been
your goddamn granddaddy.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.669
I'm sorry about him.

39:30.702 --> 39:35.474
Well, then you, uh, better not
go against your grandma.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.620
Mmm.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.155
Hmm.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.424
- Mmm!
- Yeah?

39:52.457 --> 39:53.759
Well?

39:53.792 --> 39:58.163
- Well, Rick's is good...
- Mm-hmm?

39:58.396 --> 40:00.832
...but Grandma holds the belt.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.801
Yeah.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.703
Mmm.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.404
I'm Adrienne.

40:08.473 --> 40:10.776
Diamond.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.912

it's been a minute,

42:29.748 --> 42:33.718
and I wasn't sure
what I was gonna bring.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.320
Come on.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.788
Men always say that
when they think

42:36.821 --> 42:38.990
they want us to feel special.

42:39.024 --> 42:41.559
I mean, did you feel special?

42:44.062 --> 42:45.931
I did.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.168
Good.

42:59.010 --> 43:01.880
I--
I gotta go meet someone.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.617
Okay, cool.

43:11.790 --> 43:13.692
It's work-related.

44:13.885 --> 44:17.789
Look at all this shit
and them lucky things.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.958
So is all this shit paid for?

44:19.991 --> 44:22.093
Yeah, Mai owned it.

44:22.127 --> 44:23.395
Outright?

44:23.428 --> 44:26.231
Free and clear.

44:26.264 --> 44:27.899
Got a lot of shit stacked here.

44:27.932 --> 44:30.001
You got everything you need
to start cooking?

44:30.035 --> 44:34.839
Uh, we'll need
some... supplies.

44:34.873 --> 44:39.377
It's okay.
You ain't gotta be nervous.

44:39.411 --> 44:43.214
You already produced,
and anything that you need,

44:43.248 --> 44:45.016
we gonna get for you.

44:45.050 --> 44:46.317
It's just that I didn't think

44:46.351 --> 44:47.852
that this was going
to be an ongoing--

44:47.886 --> 44:49.287
Opportunity.

44:50.422 --> 44:52.991
Um, I'm not a drug dealer.

44:53.024 --> 44:55.193
Well, good thing for you I am.

45:10.775 --> 45:12.310
Motherfucker.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.112
What the fuck?

45:14.879 --> 45:15.847
Take it.

45:16.981 --> 45:19.084
Fuck it. Let's party!

45:37.135 --> 45:39.137
Que pasa?

45:39.471 --> 45:41.272
This is incredible.

45:43.475 --> 45:44.476
Give it to me.

46:08.833 --> 46:09.901
Holy God.

46:19.410 --> 46:22.180
Soto's all the way in.

46:22.213 --> 46:24.082
- Never had a doubt.
- Get everything we need?

46:24.115 --> 46:25.216
Yeah.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.087
All right.
You really think Claudia's

46:29.120 --> 46:30.788
got the rhino skin for this?

46:30.822 --> 46:33.057
Yeah, I do.

46:33.091 --> 46:34.792
Ain't nobody ever gave
her a shot before.

46:34.826 --> 46:38.229
She been waiting for this.
What about the cook?

46:38.263 --> 46:40.798
Eh, she cool.

46:40.832 --> 46:42.867
She still
in the fucking bathroom?

46:42.901 --> 46:44.502
Yeah, she got
a little nervous.

46:44.536 --> 46:45.870
Ay-ay-yi.

46:45.904 --> 46:47.172
I mean, whatever
you got on her

46:47.205 --> 46:49.007
shook her to the bones.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.942
All right.
If Claudia don't have that--

46:50.975 --> 46:52.877
We ain't there yet.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.850
Go check on her.

47:56.975 --> 47:59.143
You all right there, boy?

47:59.177 --> 48:01.379
<i>Someone tried
to take me out.</i>

48:01.412 --> 48:04.048
What the fuck?
What?

48:05.216 --> 48:07.085
Is it one of them
Spooks at CBI?

48:07.118 --> 48:08.586
I guarantee it was one
of those motherfuckers.

48:08.620 --> 48:11.889
The shooter was white.
White as fuck.

48:13.524 --> 48:16.995
If I had to put money
on it...

48:17.028 --> 48:18.630
I'd say it was the Serbs.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.565
Wait a minute, w-why the fuck

48:20.598 --> 48:24.002
would the Serbs
try to take you out?

48:25.036 --> 48:29.107
That fucking Tommy Egan.
That fucking cocksucker.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.009
You make a move with him?

48:33.177 --> 48:35.913
You fucking dumb
son of a bitch.

48:35.947 --> 48:37.649
When are you gonna
get it through

48:37.682 --> 48:40.285
your thick fucking skull?

48:40.318 --> 48:44.489
Jesus fucking Christ,
between you and your sister,

48:44.522 --> 48:47.425
<i>all I do is run interference</i>

48:47.458 --> 48:50.428
twenty-four fucking seven.

48:59.971 --> 49:01.105
Oh.

49:01.139 --> 49:02.507
Hi.

49:02.540 --> 49:04.008
Two nights in a row?

49:04.042 --> 49:06.010
<i>I must be doing
something right.</i>

49:06.044 --> 49:09.480
Hmm.
What you got in the bag?

49:10.648 --> 49:15.520
Oh, we got pancakes,
waffles, bacon, French toast.

49:15.553 --> 49:18.056
You know, breakfast for dinner.

49:18.089 --> 49:21.559
Hmm, that sounds
like a lot of food.

49:21.592 --> 49:25.530
Well, I got some extra.

49:25.563 --> 49:28.466
How do you feel about
breakfast for breakfast?

49:46.984 --> 49:48.353
<i>Que paso, huh?</i>

49:48.386 --> 49:50.688
<i>Where's my drugs,</i> puta?

49:50.722 --> 49:54.559
You thought I was some sort
of a westside piece of shit

49:54.592 --> 49:58.429
whose-whose calls
you don't gotta return, huh?

49:58.463 --> 50:01.099
- Been busy.
- Oh, yeah?

50:01.132 --> 50:02.533
Yeah.
Figuring some shit out.

50:02.567 --> 50:04.635
- Me too.
- Mm.

50:09.207 --> 50:13.411
Huh?
We was <i>familia.</i>

50:13.444 --> 50:14.645
Okay?

50:18.082 --> 50:21.686
I'm going to miss you,
huh, <i>hermanita.</i>

50:22.387 --> 50:23.721
Love you forever...

50:24.322 --> 50:24.722
Bitch!

50:27.291 --> 50:29.060
Aah! Aah--aah--

50:29.093 --> 50:33.231
You blinded me, <i>puta.</i>
Aah, you fucking blinded me.

50:34.432 --> 50:36.634
Almost.

50:51.649 --> 50:53.684
This is who we are.

50:53.718 --> 50:57.455
And this is what we do.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.183
You bunch of cunts.

51:32.223 --> 51:33.324
