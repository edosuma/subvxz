01:32.693 --> 01:34.293
Please don't hurt me.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.404
Please.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.749
- Baby?
- I think I'm having an allergic reaction.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.385
It's, um, it's not allergies,
it's a panic attack.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.654
- I think I'm getting a heart attack.
- It's just a panic attack.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.589
You just have to calm down.
Sit down.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.159
- Where's the pills?
- You don't need the pills, okay?

02:40.161 --> 02:41.393
Where are the fucking pills?

02:41.395 --> 02:42.761
In my purse.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.767
Where are the fucking pills?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.702
Baby, they're in my purse.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.354
You want to untie me?

03:17.565 --> 03:22.201
- So, how you've been?
- Better to be honest, much like your books actually.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.969
But, er, you know...

03:24.805 --> 03:27.639
I think we've got to
go different direction.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.675
What do you mean?
What kind of direction?

03:29.677 --> 03:33.545
I-- I wanna see
Robin in the dirt.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.583
Yes, I can see it.
I went with my son to Sweden.

03:37.585 --> 03:41.720
We did one of those adventure
trips, you know, back to nature,

03:41.722 --> 03:44.323
and it was fabulous, and I think
that's what you need.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.958
Sweden? Why, why Sweden?

03:45.960 --> 03:47.659
I think you need something new.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.962
But I'm-- I'm-- I'm working on
this book right now,

03:49.964 --> 03:52.297
er... here.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.866
You know, we've done so well together.
I think you should trust me.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.336
I think you should pack
and you should go.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.806
- Okay.
- And I mean, look at me, have I ever advised you wrong?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.641
I don't know,
I have to think about it.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.910
Think about it
but don't think too long.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.511
We both need the money, right?

04:06.513 --> 04:09.281
I mean, I've got
a kid in private school,

04:09.283 --> 04:11.316
you have a lifestyle.

04:11.318 --> 04:14.019
I think it's time
to do something that sells,

04:14.021 --> 04:16.321
something new, something hip.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.406
<i>The time has come</i>

05:41.408 --> 05:43.842
<i>to balance your chakras.</i>

05:43.844 --> 05:46.478
<i>Open your third eye</i>

05:46.480 --> 05:49.681
<i>and become the dragon.</i>

05:49.683 --> 05:53.685
<i>Breathe fire,</i>

05:53.687 --> 05:56.922
<i>spread your wings and fly.</i>

05:58.459 --> 06:03.495
<i>You are free, you are strong,</i>

06:04.398 --> 06:09.434
<i>you are the dragon.</i>

06:09.436 --> 06:13.772
<i>Now, breathe like a dragon.</i>

08:17.564 --> 08:19.631
So how was
that meeting with Lilo?

08:19.633 --> 08:23.602
She wants me
to go to a farm in Sweden.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.769
Why the fuck Sweden?

08:24.771 --> 08:26.104
I don't know.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.273
It's hip or something.

08:28.275 --> 08:32.010
- Hmm.
- I know you're scared of flying, you can stay here.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.011
I don't think you should go.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.780
I have to go.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.146
I have a bad feeling about this.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.681
You always do.

09:10.284 --> 09:11.616
I love you.

09:11.618 --> 09:14.920
See you, Ted.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.955
Lorenzo,
start the car, please.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.897
Miss Richards,
I'm really sorry I'm late.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.300
I'm-- I'm really sorry I'm late.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.102
- Oh, you must be the driver?
- Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.839
So, so, so, just let me
get the bags for you.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.641
- Sure.
- Sure? Okay.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.152
Just come with me.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.186
Uh.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.935
It-- Just-- Argh. Just hop in.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.806
We're there in no time.
Just make yourself comfortable.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.313
That! You comfy?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.882
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.689
Uh.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.058
You're Robin Richards?

11:33.060 --> 11:34.292
Yeah, yeah, I am.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.895
Sorry, I'm...
I don't mean to be creepy.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.431
I-- I am Hans, by the way.

11:39.433 --> 11:42.734
- Hans.
- You can-- you can call me Hans Bubi.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.903
I am, er...

11:44.905 --> 11:48.873
I also happen to be
your biggest fan.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.076
If you-- if you would like
to do me the honors.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.110
Sure.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.246
Just write, "To Hans".

12:03.190 --> 12:05.123
Wonderful. Wow.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.928
Um... You-- You don't mind?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.871
Yeah. And-- and maybe this one?

12:25.812 --> 12:27.145
Just this-- this last one.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.414
It's not-- not
so much my favorite.

12:29.416 --> 12:33.118
It's not really what-- what I would
consider a Robin Richards book, you know.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.820
But still, it's-- it's okay.
It's got its moments.

12:35.822 --> 12:36.955
I wrote it.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.356
Yeah, I know, but...

12:38.358 --> 12:40.358
It's not a Robin Richards'.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.861
You can-- you can do
a lot better than that.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.028
Really?

12:49.836 --> 12:54.172
Great. Yeah, you know, I know you're
going to write the next masterpiece here.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.940
I'm sure of it.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.142
It's going to be great.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.981
So-- so, er...
Are you here alone?

13:02.983 --> 13:04.849
Yeah, my boyfriend
is arriving tomorrow.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.851
- Oh, your boyfriend, yeah?
- At noon.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.454
Yeah? Okay. So?

13:09.456 --> 13:12.423
I was actually going to ask you
if you could pick him up.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.260
Just anywhere you want to go,
just-- just call me, just...

13:15.262 --> 13:18.830
- call Bubi and... I'll get you there.
- Thank you.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.811
You know, I really do love
your books, you know.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.015
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I've read them several times.

13:37.017 --> 13:41.820
- Really?
- No, I-- I-- I wish I could write like that.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.354
Are you a writer?

13:43.356 --> 13:48.259
I want to be. But it's...
still it's only in my dreams.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.396
It is, it's hard having dreams
in a place like this, you know.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.231
Why is that?

13:53.233 --> 13:57.035
I don't know. It's here,
nothing ever happens here.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.405
Whoa!

14:00.407 --> 14:01.439
What was that?

14:02.309 --> 14:05.310
- Wow! Are you okay?
- Yes.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.245
Shit. Ha!

14:08.114 --> 14:11.015
Wow, it just fell off! Damn!

14:19.459 --> 14:20.925
Shit.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.363
It's...

14:26.967 --> 14:28.366
Just have to...

14:28.368 --> 14:31.102
Just go and wait
in the car. It's-- It's okay.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.344
- No, you shouldn't really.
- No, I'll help.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.313
I've got it. I-- I've got this.
Just go and sit, sit in the car.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.650
It's-- It's okay.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.286
You know...

14:48.288 --> 14:49.621
This...

14:49.623 --> 14:51.356
You shouldn't really.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.527
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.962
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.297
Ah. Slowly, slowly.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.933
Hush.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.906
Just listen.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.974
- Do you hear?
- What?

15:09.976 --> 15:11.175
The forest.

15:11.177 --> 15:15.280
Don't you think this would be a
great opening for your next book?

15:15.282 --> 15:18.650
- What do you mean?
- The driver and his-- his passenger just

15:18.652 --> 15:22.687
getting stuck in the middle of nowhere
in the dark forest and you know,

15:22.689 --> 15:25.990
some ancient evil wakes up
and start haunting them and...

15:25.992 --> 15:28.526
and killing them
and eating them and whatever.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.560
Wouldn't that be great?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.930
Should we put
the couch on the roof?

15:31.932 --> 15:36.301
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure. Right.
Right. Argh. You're ready?

15:36.303 --> 15:38.937
One, two, three.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.328
There.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.398
Um, sorry about the bumpy ride.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.699
- That's fine.
- OK. OK. Sure.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.668
Um, here's for tomorrow as well.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.671
- We talked about this.
- Oh, oh, your boyfriend, yeah.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.172
- Picking him up at noon.
- Yes.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.440
- Yeah, right. Got it.
- If that's okay?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.609
- Sure. Sure. Got it.
- Thank you.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.736
Oh, shit. Did I scare you?

17:51.738 --> 17:55.106
No, I, I just didn't expect...
that thing.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.575
It's a hen, an animal.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.811
Yeah, I-- I guess
it is an animal, yeah.

17:59.813 --> 18:02.313
- You must be Robin?
- Yeah, and you must be Rolf?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.449
Yeah. You can call me Rofer.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.783
Rofer. Got it.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.285
Do you mind holding it?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.220
I-- I don't know how to hold it.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.655
- Just like a baby.
- But I've never hold it.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.124
- Squeeze over the wing.
- Over the wing?

18:14.094 --> 18:15.660
OK. Over the wing.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.429
OK. OK. OK. OK. OK.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.131
- I'll pick some eggs.
- OK.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.240
Two eggs.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.176
Present for you.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.711
- Uh...
- You can eat it tomorrow.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.179
What-- what if it breaks? Okay.

18:35.181 --> 18:38.149
- Don't squeeze it.
- No, uh, I won't.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.119
So, now I can take that.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.154
- Okay.
- Thank you.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.508
Please, come in.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.782
Here's the bed.
I made it myself.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.151
It's a nice bed.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.685
Yeah, and cozy.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.495
That's my wife.
She's resting out there.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.198
She's buried in the garden?

19:27.200 --> 19:31.369
Yeah. She loved the garden.
But now, it's only a garden of...

19:32.505 --> 19:33.271
death.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.278
Let me show you the kitchen.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.422
I renovated it myself.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.856
Yeah, it's nice.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.325
I renovated the chimney.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.527
You can make
a fire in the stove.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.564
Oh. Sorry, my sister
must have been here.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.977
This is my wife, Linda.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.578
Isn't she beautiful?

20:48.314 --> 20:49.714
Yeah, she's lovely.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.382
She was a fine lady.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.018
Um...

20:54.020 --> 20:55.753
I don't see a restroom.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.388
It's in another part.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.556
Please, I will show you.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.424
- Another place?
- Yes.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.927
- Outside?
- Yes.

21:17.744 --> 21:18.776
Fuck.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.645
Argh!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.053
Great.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.802
Aw.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.280
Hey. Um...

30:55.120 --> 30:57.287
It's a really great day.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.459
Do you know if there's
any way down to the lake?

31:12.938 --> 31:14.104
Thank you.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.362
Seriously.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.433
Argh!

31:49.642 --> 31:51.141
What the fuck.

37:04.957 --> 37:08.291
<i>The time has come</i>

37:08.293 --> 37:10.860
<i>to balance your chakras.</i>

37:10.862 --> 37:13.496

37:13.498 --> 37:17.234

37:17.703 --> 37:19.903

38:26.772 --> 38:27.770
Hello.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.375
Hey. Hey. Hey.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.015
- Hey there.
- Hi. Can I borrow your phone?

38:39.017 --> 38:40.984
It's broken, out of order.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.452
It's lost, Ted took it.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.991
Do you know where there's
any cellphone connection?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.360
You can try up in the hills.

38:50.362 --> 38:54.364
Find a high peak, and, I mean,
maybe you'll get some connection there.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.032
The road over here?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.667
Yeah, straight ahead.

38:59.071 --> 39:00.403
Thank you.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.392
Where have you been?

43:49.394 --> 43:51.728
Where's Ted?

43:51.730 --> 43:53.096
Ted never showed.

43:54.633 --> 43:57.033
Oh...

44:04.175 --> 44:05.174
Thank you.

44:07.412 --> 44:10.346
Probably nothing,
he's scared of flying.

44:10.348 --> 44:11.681
Yeah?

44:19.190 --> 44:20.723
I need a phone.

44:20.725 --> 44:22.959
- This is a phone.
- It doesn't work.

44:40.078 --> 44:42.111
Rats, probably.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.148
You know, you can use mine.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.818
The one at home. That works.

44:50.922 --> 44:53.222
Um, well, I'll probably
have to shower.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.223
Yeah.

44:55.694 --> 44:57.427
Change some clothes.

44:57.429 --> 44:58.761
Looks good.

46:12.003 --> 46:14.370
It's right this way.

46:14.372 --> 46:15.872
We're doing a bit of renovating.

46:15.874 --> 46:17.373
So it's-- it's
kind of messy right now,

46:17.375 --> 46:19.842
but it's gonna be fine.

46:51.876 --> 46:54.110
Sorry, just got to
move the couch.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.946
Okay. All right.

47:01.953 --> 47:03.119
Come on right in.

47:06.157 --> 47:07.991
Just come on in here.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.492
We're renovating, so it's
gonna be... It's gonna be cool.

47:12.297 --> 47:13.930
Bubi cave.

47:13.932 --> 47:15.898
- The telephone.
- Huh?

47:16.434 --> 47:17.433
The telephone.

47:27.912 --> 47:29.045
Here it is.

47:31.950 --> 47:33.916
Oh, you...
Maybe you wanna sit down?

47:33.918 --> 47:35.451
- Sure.
- Yes, sure.

47:36.254 --> 47:37.386
Just sit here.

47:38.456 --> 47:41.557
Sure you wanna sit like that?

47:41.559 --> 47:43.159
Just sit down.

47:47.866 --> 47:49.131
There you are.

47:54.405 --> 47:56.973
Yeah, just push
the buttons and...

47:58.209 --> 48:00.176
Oh, you-- you-- you want
some privacy?

48:14.459 --> 48:17.927
Lorenzo, is Ted with you?

48:20.565 --> 48:21.898
What?

48:22.901 --> 48:24.100
He's not here.

48:25.003 --> 48:26.369
Yeah, you're probably right.

48:27.939 --> 48:29.105
Yeah.

48:31.943 --> 48:33.109
Um...

48:33.945 --> 48:37.179
All right, talk later.

48:43.321 --> 48:45.087
So where is he?

48:45.089 --> 48:46.455
I don't know.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.100
You know,
my wife probably did that.

49:03.007 --> 49:04.373
She's jealous.

49:40.044 --> 49:42.311
We're being totally rude.

49:42.313 --> 49:46.582
You haven't introduced me
to your... whore.

49:57.562 --> 49:58.728
I'm Robin.

49:58.730 --> 49:59.996
I know who you are.

49:59.998 --> 50:03.366
I've been using
your books as toilet paper.

50:04.736 --> 50:09.772
I'm sorry about my wife.
She can be... You know she--

50:09.774 --> 50:12.041
You know, sometimes she just--

50:12.043 --> 50:13.476
She just gets mad and...

50:14.512 --> 50:16.612
Actually, she scares me.

50:17.615 --> 50:20.516
Can you pick me up tomorrow?
I'm going to the airport.

50:21.753 --> 50:23.352
What?

50:23.354 --> 50:24.353
Yeah.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.289
It was a mistake coming here.

50:28.326 --> 50:31.027
What do you mean, what do you
mean a mistake coming here?

50:31.729 --> 50:35.164
I can't write anymore. I'm done.

50:35.166 --> 50:37.633
Of course you can write.
You are Robin Richards.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.802
You're the greatest author
in the world.

50:39.804 --> 50:41.771
Just don't give up.

50:41.773 --> 50:43.472
Don't go home.

50:43.474 --> 50:45.341
Stay here and try.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.546
Pick me up tomorrow, same time.

52:36.521 --> 52:42.224
<i> She loved the garden.
But now, it's only a garden of death.</i>

59:03.107 --> 59:04.072
Hush.

59:09.613 --> 59:10.846
Hush.

59:12.149 --> 59:13.615
Help!

59:24.028 --> 59:25.093
Hush.

59:55.993 --> 59:56.992
Hans!

59:57.895 --> 59:59.194
Bubi!

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:47.976
Please don't hurt me.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:50.078
Hush.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.053
Please.

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:15.937
No, no, please.

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:17.039
Shush.

01:01:22.413 --> 01:01:23.979
No, please. No, please.

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.457
Robin?

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:09.459
I'm sorry.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.126
I don't want to eat one.

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:26.241
What do you want?

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:34.516
Robin?

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:36.151
Help!

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:40.789
Hush.

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.296
Help.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.365
Help!

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:01.409
Robin?

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.534
Help!

01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:26.868
Robin?

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:42.190
Hans! Hans!

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.063
Hans!

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:54.602
Hans!

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:13.488
Hans.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.108
Hans!

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.306
I'm really sorry about my wife.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:12.740
She has a bad temper.

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:02.957
<i> The time has</i>
<i>come to balance your chakras.</i>

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:05.526
<i>Open your third eye.</i>

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:08.830
<i>And become the dragon.</i>

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:12.333
<i>Breathe fire.</i>

01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:16.604
<i>Spread your wings and fly.</i>

01:11:17.741 --> 01:11:20.742
<i>You are free.</i>

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:22.677
<i>You are strong.</i>

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.282
<i>You are the dragon.</i>

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:33.321
<i>Now, breathe like a dragon.</i>

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:38.493
<i>Breathe in, breathe out.</i>

01:11:38.495 --> 01:11:41.629
<i>Breathe in, breathe out.</i>

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:46.434
<i>Breathe in, breathe out.</i>

01:13:06.116 --> 01:13:07.548
Help me.

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:11.919
Help me.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:18.393
I need a phone.

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:20.661
Do you have a phone, please?

01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:23.631
A telephone.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.495
Lorenzo?

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:46.013
Hello again.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.889
I'm very sorry about my wife.

01:15:01.498 --> 01:15:03.631
And I'm very sorry
about the finger.

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:09.871
But I will make it good.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.906
Don't worry.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.949
Don't hurt me.

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:23.651
You will be fine.

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.052
Don't worry.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:26.053
Please.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.889
You're looking
a little bit damaged.

01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:04.559
Would you like some <i> fika?</i>

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:07.061
That is coffee and buns.

01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:10.998
Sure.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.300
Good.

01:16:12.302 --> 01:16:13.901
Then I will get it for you.

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:16.170
I-- I'll come back.
