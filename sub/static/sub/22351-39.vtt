WEBVTT

00:01.990 --> 00:03.990
Previously on "Big Brother."

00:05.990 --> 00:09.989
After a shocking double eviction
sent Austin and Judas packing...

00:09.990 --> 00:12.989
Austin, I vote to evict you.

00:12.990 --> 00:14.989
It's official.

00:14.990 --> 00:18.999
Austin, you're evicted from the
Big Brother house.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.829
Vanessa immediately began to
cover her tracks.

00:22.830 --> 00:26.989
I didn't want to do it like
that.

00:26.990 --> 00:33.989
When Steve took home a huge
win... he decided to nominate

00:33.990 --> 00:36.989
his two allies.

00:36.990 --> 00:39.989
I nominate you this week.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.119
This week doesn't mean a thing.

00:42.120 --> 00:47.119
It's up to the person that wins
the beetle.

00:47.120 --> 00:55.120
Vanessa made two deals with
Liz and John.

00:57.990 --> 01:01.289
And a veto.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.989
Everything was on the line for
the final four.

01:03.990 --> 01:09.119
If I win, I can choose who
will came along with me and

01:09.120 --> 01:10.989
Steve to final three.

01:10.990 --> 01:12.539
That's a huge power.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.989
And Vanessa chopped down the
competition.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.989
You have won the final veto
of the summer.

01:16.990 --> 01:22.989
At the veto meeting, Vanessa
became the sole vote to evict.

01:22.990 --> 01:24.989
Johnny voted to evict you.

01:24.990 --> 01:28.989
Sending Johnny mack to the
jury for the second time.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.989
Bye, Johnny.

01:30.990 --> 01:35.989
Tonight, the battle for the
final head of household begins.

01:35.990 --> 01:38.989
Plus, the final three celebrate
the summer.

01:38.990 --> 01:41.989
Can you believe there were 17
of us?

01:41.990 --> 01:42.990
And now we're down to three.

01:42.991 --> 01:46.989
Including some moments you
haven't seen.

01:46.990 --> 01:48.989
Why are you being a bitch?

01:48.990 --> 01:49.990
Excuse me?

01:49.991 --> 01:51.990
All this right now on "big
brother."

02:32.990 --> 02:33.990
All right, guys.

02:33.991 --> 02:36.989
We made final three.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.700
Yeah!
>> Yeah!

02:37.701 --> 02:39.119
That's what I'm talking about.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.989
All right.

02:40.990 --> 02:41.990
Let's celebrate.

02:41.991 --> 02:47.989
I've always wanted to take
one person like Johnny mack and

02:47.990 --> 02:48.990
Steve to final three.

02:48.991 --> 02:52.989
I need to make sure Liz and
Steve feel great about our

02:52.990 --> 02:56.989
relationships so they take me as
they're supposed to if they win

02:56.990 --> 02:59.989
the h.O.H.

02:59.990 --> 03:02.409
Yeah!
>> Have you ever had champagne?

03:02.410 --> 03:02.990
Yeah.

03:02.991 --> 03:05.989
This is a really good kind.

03:05.990 --> 03:09.999
Every time I chased it with
something, I regret that

03:10.000 --> 03:10.990
position.

03:10.991 --> 03:14.989
I'm going to mass.
>> Upset about John.

03:14.990 --> 03:18.119
He was would have taken me to
the end.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.989
What an underdog he is, the
friends he has, he would have

03:21.990 --> 03:22.990
been hard to beat.

03:22.991 --> 03:25.989
With him going, it takes me one
step closer to the end.

03:25.990 --> 03:28.989
Thank you, Big Brother.
>> Thank you, Big Brother.

03:28.990 --> 03:33.989
What to do now!
We have a competition.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.989
Vanessa thinks John am I are
so stoked.

03:36.990 --> 03:39.989
I've been really close with her
and worked well with her.

03:39.990 --> 03:43.989
And I would love nothing more
than to get to the final with

03:43.990 --> 03:46.989
Vanessa over someone like Steve
who took on my sister.

03:46.990 --> 03:51.699
If we're going to finale as
never having been in jury, that

03:51.700 --> 03:52.989
is something.

03:52.990 --> 03:55.539
That is big.

03:55.540 --> 04:00.989
♪ Blessed.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.999
Are you nervous?

04:03.000 --> 04:03.990
I had a speech

04:03.990 --> 04:04.990
you did great.

04:04.991 --> 04:10.289
Just so good.

04:10.290 --> 04:13.699
What do you mean?

04:13.700 --> 04:18.989
[Whispering].

04:18.990 --> 04:20.989
There's something with him.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.989
Vanessa and I have a deal.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.989
I can really trust her in that
she's going to bring me over

04:25.990 --> 04:25.991
Steve.

04:25.991 --> 04:30.989
I mean, girl power absolutely!
>> I wonder where we're going to

04:30.990 --> 04:31.000
sleep.

04:31.001 --> 04:39.001
Where are you going to sleep?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.989
You're talking about a speech.

04:43.990 --> 04:43.991
Something.

04:43.991 --> 04:47.989
He knew he was going.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.989
Okay.

04:50.990 --> 04:51.990
He knew.

04:51.991 --> 04:59.989
Made sense.

04:59.990 --> 05:07.989
[Whispering].

05:07.990 --> 05:09.989
I'll give you my word.

05:09.990 --> 05:11.989
I did not.

05:11.990 --> 05:12.990
I did not.

05:12.991 --> 05:15.989
Those words never came out of my
mouth.

05:15.990 --> 05:18.989
Are you two taking each other
or something?

05:18.990 --> 05:21.989
You would have been foolish
voting to keep her.

05:21.990 --> 05:23.989
I didn't make any promises.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.409
Why not?

05:25.410 --> 05:26.989
Why would I?

05:26.990 --> 05:28.409
That's a big enough thing.

05:28.410 --> 05:33.989
Like to ask for her for
something in return.

05:33.990 --> 05:41.990
[Whispering].

05:54.540 --> 05:58.989
[Whispering].

05:58.990 --> 06:01.989
I'm definitely an easier win.

06:01.990 --> 06:02.990
I know.

06:02.991 --> 06:06.989
There's a lot of history
between Steve and I.

06:06.990 --> 06:09.989
Right now I'm telling him what
he needs to feel 100% solid.

06:09.990 --> 06:13.989
We still have all parts of the
h.O.H. Competition to come.

06:13.990 --> 06:17.539
I need everybody on the right
page to take me to the final two

06:17.540 --> 06:21.989
if they win the h.O.H.

06:21.990 --> 06:22.990
It's nothing personal.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.989
I did a lot in this game.

06:25.990 --> 06:30.409
I think, a, not people know much
about it and b, the people do

06:30.410 --> 06:32.989
think about it and go home.
>> It would be foolish for me to

06:32.990 --> 06:37.989
go to the other side with
somebody that is so great at

06:37.990 --> 06:39.989
everything in this game.

06:39.990 --> 06:44.989
If I sit next to Liz and take
credit of taking Vanessa out,

06:44.990 --> 06:50.989
that would be huge with the
votes.

06:50.990 --> 06:55.989
Oh, my goodness!
>> Oh!

06:55.990 --> 06:57.829
Oh, my God.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.989
Orange rose is my favorite.

06:59.990 --> 07:00.990
So cute.

07:00.991 --> 07:04.989
I feel like I'm in a little
hotel, a five-star hotel.

07:04.990 --> 07:05.990
Final three, guys.

07:05.991 --> 07:11.289
That's what I'm talking about.

07:11.290 --> 07:14.989
Yeah!
>> I want a little toast.

07:14.990 --> 07:18.989
We have to toast something.

07:18.990 --> 07:25.119
Final three.
>> We made it this far!

07:25.120 --> 07:26.989
Oh, this is so cute.

07:26.990 --> 07:30.989
You guys, can you believe it
there were 17 of us?

07:30.990 --> 07:32.989
Now we're down to three.

07:32.990 --> 07:36.119
And Liz, we thought for the
first five weeks there were one

07:36.120 --> 07:36.990
of you.

07:36.991 --> 07:42.539
Turns out actually, no, you have
a clone and you were going to

07:42.540 --> 07:43.989
sprout into two people.

07:43.990 --> 07:43.991
Insane.

07:43.991 --> 07:50.989
Did not see that coming.

07:50.990 --> 07:53.989
Oh, my God.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.989
I'm going to cry.

07:55.990 --> 07:59.989
I'm like I'm not hitting off
with the guys.

07:59.990 --> 08:06.999
I feel like I'm the prettiest
girl here.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.949
James likes the Liz action.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.989
The h.O.H.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.989
My lips are so chapped.

08:15.990 --> 08:21.989
If it wasn't for little
Mr. Jason and day, I'd think we

08:21.990 --> 08:26.989
would have had you guys fooled a
little bit longer.

08:26.990 --> 08:29.989
Uh-huh.

08:29.990 --> 08:31.999
It's ridiculously obvious.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.990
What?

08:32.991 --> 08:35.989
There's a pair of twins in
the house.

08:35.990 --> 08:40.539
What do you mean?

08:40.540 --> 08:42.289
Liz has a twin.

08:42.290 --> 08:43.409
I noticed it before.

08:43.410 --> 08:46.119
I thought no, you're trippin'.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.989
But today...
>> for the past couple weeks,

08:49.990 --> 08:54.989
I've been noticing that Liz's
body isn't the same every time I

08:54.990 --> 08:55.990
see her.

08:55.991 --> 09:01.539
9:00 A.M., you had a little bit
more weight than that.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.989
Slim fast don't work that fast.

09:03.990 --> 09:04.990
She looks slimmer.

09:04.991 --> 09:08.989
The one last night is the
friendly one.

09:08.990 --> 09:10.289
This isn't.

09:10.290 --> 09:10.990
No.

09:10.991 --> 09:14.989
She has a lot of hats that
cover their faces, eye glasses

09:14.990 --> 09:17.989
that cover their faces.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.989
Am I burnt?

09:20.990 --> 09:20.991
No.

09:20.991 --> 09:23.989
I don't want to get too toasty.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.989
Can I see your glasses, Liz?

09:25.990 --> 09:29.989
Yeah.

09:29.990 --> 09:32.539
They're like mirrored.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.989
Liz has a [Bleep] twin.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.289
They're switching in and out.

09:35.290 --> 09:37.989
Last night she was heavy twin.

09:37.990 --> 09:39.989
Today she's skinny twin.

09:39.990 --> 09:43.949
Yesterday she was 20 pounds
heavier.

09:43.950 --> 09:44.989
That one with the hat.

09:44.990 --> 09:47.989
That one wear as bikini.

09:47.990 --> 09:49.989
That one works out all day.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.989
Which one should I go for?

09:51.990 --> 09:55.989
Go look at her face.

09:55.990 --> 09:59.989
?

09:59.990 --> 10:00.990
Look.

10:00.991 --> 10:08.991
Come here.

10:10.990 --> 10:16.989
Liz has an identical twin.

10:16.990 --> 10:16.991
100%.

10:16.991 --> 10:17.990
It's crazy.

10:17.991 --> 10:21.989
Every time we do our
fingernails, she keeps the same

10:21.990 --> 10:22.990
color every time.

10:22.991 --> 10:24.989
Makes sense.

10:24.990 --> 10:25.990
It makes sense.

10:25.990 --> 10:26.540
Yeah.

10:26.541 --> 10:31.999
She's just trying to survive
until her sister comes in.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.119
I've never in a million years
could fathom how difficult and

10:37.120 --> 10:38.989
long this entire process was.

10:38.990 --> 10:42.289
I had my share of struggles, not
to mention confrontations.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.829
But I'm here somehow.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.989
Should I have won it though
or...

10:45.990 --> 10:50.989
like I hate to break it, but
you have a high I.Q. And you're

10:50.990 --> 10:52.989
never going to convince me you
didn't throw that.

10:52.990 --> 10:54.949
I did try to throw it.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.989
Are you kidding me?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.989
I swear...
>> you must think I'm stupid.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.989
I didn't try to throw it.

11:03.990 --> 11:04.990
Never in a million years.

11:04.991 --> 11:07.989
I didn't try to throw it.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.409
I'll be pissed.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.989
The whole house wants Audrey
house.

11:11.990 --> 11:14.989
I need an excuse to put somebody
else on the block.

11:14.990 --> 11:17.989
Jeff would be a great
replacement.

11:17.990 --> 11:21.989
Now I have all the ammunition I
need.

11:21.990 --> 11:24.989
Time for operation expose Jeff,
this is my chance.

11:24.990 --> 11:27.539
I want to know what is true
and what is not true.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.989
Austin, nobody is driving
your name through the mud.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.989
You never said Austin is a
target for you?

11:32.990 --> 11:33.120
No.

11:33.121 --> 11:39.539
You never said you couldn't
work with Shelli and Clay as a

11:39.540 --> 11:39.990
couple?

11:39.990 --> 11:40.990
I'm not a liar.

11:40.990 --> 11:41.990
Let me tell you.

11:41.991 --> 11:43.119
I'll put my hand on the Bible.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.989
No, no, no.

11:45.990 --> 11:50.989
You're going to... you might
be like silly.

11:50.990 --> 11:54.989
Don't you dare!
I'm sorry.

11:54.990 --> 11:55.990
Just have fun.

11:55.990 --> 11:56.990
Okay.

11:56.991 --> 11:58.989
Have fun.

11:58.990 --> 11:59.990
That's it.

11:59.990 --> 12:00.990
Straight up liar.

12:00.991 --> 12:04.119
Anything you guys want to
discuss?

12:04.120 --> 12:06.989
You set up the whole thing to
get him out.

12:06.990 --> 12:10.949
You want to fight for Justin?

12:10.950 --> 12:10.990
Fine.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.989
I had no reason to put him up.

12:12.990 --> 12:13.990
Nobody takes me personally.

12:13.991 --> 12:18.289
And you and Austin were
coming up with reasons...

12:18.290 --> 12:19.989
what?

12:19.990 --> 12:23.989
Straight up...
>> I swear on my life...

12:23.990 --> 12:26.829
quit squaring on your life.

12:26.830 --> 12:26.990
Dude.

12:26.991 --> 12:29.989
Do you not value your life?

12:29.990 --> 12:33.949
Stop.
>> I know we took a risk last

12:33.950 --> 12:33.990
week.

12:33.991 --> 12:36.989
It didn't work out and that's
that.

12:36.990 --> 12:43.999
This is my decision?

12:44.000 --> 12:48.289
Look, Vanessa, stop.

12:48.290 --> 12:49.989
Please stop it.

12:49.990 --> 12:50.700
Sit down.

12:50.701 --> 12:54.989
I'm telling you...
>> sit down, stop.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.989
Can we all keep our voices down?

12:57.990 --> 12:59.409
I need time.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.989
I fully expect to be a target.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.989
I would have expected you people
to tell me rather than everybody

13:04.990 --> 13:05.540
else.

13:05.541 --> 13:08.989
The thing is, I don't play
the game like you do.

13:08.990 --> 13:11.989
You remember every little piece
and you hold on to what it is.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.989
You're trying to play the game
too hard.

13:13.990 --> 13:18.699
I don't sit there and say, okay,
let me think.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.989
You're literally insulting you.

13:19.990 --> 13:21.989
I'm not insulting you.

13:21.990 --> 13:22.290
All right.

13:22.291 --> 13:25.829
It's best you go down...
>> you want me to say you're not

13:25.830 --> 13:25.990
playing the game.

13:25.990 --> 13:26.830
No.

13:26.831 --> 13:28.989
You said you're playing the game
too hard.

13:28.990 --> 13:30.829
That's a criticism.

13:30.830 --> 13:32.999
So what I'm doing is wrong?

13:33.000 --> 13:38.989
So you're going to take it
out on her for me?

13:38.990 --> 13:41.989
I want you to know the more
you piss me off the more you're

13:41.990 --> 13:42.990
locking her fate out.

13:50.990 --> 13:53.989
As much that went down in
this house, it wasn't without

13:53.990 --> 13:56.989
its share of romance either,
miss Liz.

13:56.990 --> 13:59.989
Who would have thought you come
to "Big Brother" to fall in

13:59.990 --> 14:00.990
love?

14:00.991 --> 14:02.949
He worked his way to my heart.

14:02.950 --> 14:03.989
I'll tell you that much.

14:03.990 --> 14:07.989
And what is cool, you have
the Shelli and Clay show.

14:07.990 --> 14:12.989
And then you have you and
Austin, which came so...

14:12.990 --> 14:13.990
everybody was like what?

14:13.991 --> 14:16.119
The beauty and the beast.

14:16.120 --> 14:22.989
She's such a biotch, okay?

14:22.990 --> 14:30.990
[Laughter]
>> So Austin and I are besties.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.989
I love hanging out with him.

14:37.990 --> 14:42.989
But I don't see him in a
romantic light.

14:42.990 --> 14:50.990
It tickles.

14:52.990 --> 14:57.989
I hate you!
You're so annoying!

14:57.990 --> 14:58.990
You like me?

14:58.991 --> 15:06.699
We like each other.

15:06.700 --> 15:06.990
Is that it?

15:06.990 --> 15:07.990
That's it.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.989
Okay.

15:09.990 --> 15:17.990
I know I did not like Austin,
but now I like him.

15:23.990 --> 15:29.989
Uh-oh!
>> Are you more excited to meet

15:29.990 --> 15:37.990
his mom, his dad or his
girlfriend!

15:42.540 --> 15:43.989
We love you.

15:43.990 --> 15:45.989
Obviously I knew he had a
girlfriend.

15:45.990 --> 15:47.539
How do I feel about it?

15:47.540 --> 15:51.989
It's not my problem.

15:51.990 --> 15:53.289
I'm single.

15:53.290 --> 15:54.539
It's 18 months.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.989
Obviously you're serious.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.989
That was when I was trying to
chase her, still.

15:59.990 --> 16:02.989
That's like so unattractive.

16:02.990 --> 16:06.989
Are you serious right now?

16:06.990 --> 16:13.989
You think I'm hooking up with
a guy that has a girlfriend?

16:13.990 --> 16:13.991
Whatever.

16:13.991 --> 16:15.989
Thanks for joining me tonight.

16:15.990 --> 16:16.990
This is really nice.

16:16.991 --> 16:20.989
When he came in, we had a bit
of a rough patch.

16:20.990 --> 16:23.989
Liz is someone that is genuinely
special to me.

16:23.990 --> 16:26.999
I want to build a relationship
with her outside of this house.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.989
Things are progressing.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.989
I think it's appropriate that I
ask you something.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.699
What do you want to ask me?

16:33.700 --> 16:37.699
Will you be my girlfriend.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.989
Yes, I will be your girlfriend.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.989
Oh, wow.

16:42.990 --> 16:43.990
Thank you.

16:43.991 --> 16:47.829
It's funny how Austin was
working on you, kept working you

16:47.830 --> 16:49.989
and got his way out of the
friend zone.

16:49.990 --> 16:52.989
But then you had James and Meg.

16:52.990 --> 16:59.699
James every night tried to crawl
in with her and get a kiss.

16:59.700 --> 17:00.989
Be nice.

17:00.990 --> 17:06.989
And I'm still he's probably
not gotten anywhere with Meg.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.989
Not Meg.

17:08.990 --> 17:15.949
Not Julia.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.989
Yeah, girl.

17:17.990 --> 17:18.990
You put them spikes on.

17:18.991 --> 17:20.829
Hello, Big Brother.

17:20.830 --> 17:21.989
Hi, Meg.

17:21.990 --> 17:26.989
Want to let the whole world know
we are getting engaged!

17:26.990 --> 17:29.989
We're getting married!
We're in love!

17:29.990 --> 17:37.990
Not only is James important
for my game, but he's also very

17:38.410 --> 17:40.989
important for my sanity.

17:40.990 --> 17:40.991
[Screaming].

17:40.991 --> 17:44.989
Get away from me.

17:44.990 --> 17:46.989
Get away from me.

17:46.990 --> 17:53.989
But if James really thinks
we're engaged, he's crazy.

17:53.990 --> 17:57.989
Meg, your lipstick matches
your shirt.

17:57.990 --> 18:01.989
I agree with start her out
from day one and it's all been

18:01.990 --> 18:04.989
taken out and it's just down to
me and Meg in this game.

18:04.990 --> 18:10.989
Meg, I think I saw them pass
you.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.989
Good luck, sweetheart.

18:12.990 --> 18:18.989
Good night, Mr. James.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.289
Shut up, Steve.

18:21.290 --> 18:22.989
Dude, that is the worst.

18:22.990 --> 18:25.989
What is wrong with my bathing
suit?

18:25.990 --> 18:26.999
It looked good.

18:27.000 --> 18:27.990
I like it.

18:27.991 --> 18:29.699
Shut up.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.989
I vibrant.

18:30.990 --> 18:32.829
It's day 60 something.

18:32.830 --> 18:36.989
You know, I haven't made a break
through yet, but I think Meg has

18:36.990 --> 18:39.289
a crush for me, so I'm not
giving up.

18:39.290 --> 18:40.989
She loves you.

18:40.990 --> 18:42.539
I can't stand him.

18:42.540 --> 18:48.989
So yeah, I definitely have my
shomance, but I think someone

18:48.990 --> 18:51.989
here, Steve, had his nerdmance
with Johnny mack.

18:51.990 --> 18:55.409
I was really nervous coming
into this house.

18:55.410 --> 19:03.410
I've always been a social misfit
in life.

19:04.990 --> 19:08.949
We're the needs, the geeks.

19:08.950 --> 19:10.989
We didn't cuddle like you and
Austin.

19:10.990 --> 19:11.990
I know.

19:11.990 --> 19:12.990
This is Johnny mack.

19:12.990 --> 19:13.990
You went there.

19:13.990 --> 19:14.990
I did.

19:14.991 --> 19:18.949
Johnny and mack and I have a
very interesting relationship.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.289
We're very comfortable with each
other.

19:20.290 --> 19:23.989
We have the ability to joke back
and forth about some things

19:23.990 --> 19:29.989
because we're so comfortable
with each other.

19:29.990 --> 19:33.989
Definitely a little bromance
going on there.

19:33.990 --> 19:36.989
I love Johnny mack very much.

19:36.990 --> 19:37.990
I noticed you.

19:37.991 --> 19:39.989
I'm going to sit with you.

19:39.990 --> 19:41.119
You make me feel so good.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.989
You guys have to get ahead in
the game.

19:43.990 --> 19:47.989
You have to make sure that
people find you pleasant to be

19:47.990 --> 19:47.991
around.

19:47.991 --> 19:49.989
I'll rock you to sleep, Steve.

19:49.990 --> 19:50.990
Don't worry.

19:50.991 --> 19:54.989
Everybody likes to be played
with, so why not play with

19:54.990 --> 19:54.991
everyone?

19:54.991 --> 19:57.989
You want to snuggle?

19:57.990 --> 19:58.540
Maybe.

19:58.541 --> 20:02.989
I'll cuddle.

20:02.990 --> 20:02.991
Come here.

20:02.991 --> 20:03.999
This is weird.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.989
It doesn't have to be sexual.

20:11.990 --> 20:11.991
Right?

20:11.991 --> 20:13.989
No.

20:13.990 --> 20:20.119
There's been shomances and
bromances in the past, but maybe

20:20.120 --> 20:21.989
try a new ground here.

20:21.990 --> 20:22.990
This is a nerd man.

20:22.991 --> 20:24.989
I'll make out with anyone in
this house right now.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.409
Yeah.

20:26.410 --> 20:28.989
Whoa!
>> You'll make out with a guy?

20:28.990 --> 20:34.289
No.

20:34.290 --> 20:35.989
Okay.

20:35.990 --> 20:39.699
Ultimately, Shelli won his
heart.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.989
My name is Clay.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.989
I'm from Texas, a small town.

20:43.990 --> 20:46.989
My mom is a wildlife
rehabilitator.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.989
We have all kinds of wild
animals around house.

20:48.990 --> 20:50.989
Oh, stop!
>> Yeah.

20:50.990 --> 20:51.990
Oh, lord.

20:51.991 --> 20:54.699
Clay is going to get me in
trouble this summer.

20:54.700 --> 20:55.410
I'm 23.

20:55.411 --> 20:56.989
The baby.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.289
I'm ten years older than this
guy.

20:59.290 --> 21:00.989
But I don't think I care.

21:00.990 --> 21:07.949
Age is just a number, right?

21:07.950 --> 21:12.989
He's really...
>> are you married?

21:12.990 --> 21:13.999
No.

21:14.000 --> 21:14.990
I was married.

21:14.991 --> 21:17.949
I really enjoy Shelli.

21:17.950 --> 21:18.989
She's 33.

21:18.990 --> 21:20.949
She mentioned she's divorce.

21:20.950 --> 21:24.989
I'm kind of into older women and
getting to know her a little

21:24.990 --> 21:24.991
better.

21:24.991 --> 21:28.989
Shelli, we've been informed
that Clay's favorite place to go

21:28.990 --> 21:29.990
eat is golden corral.

21:29.991 --> 21:33.949
What are your thoughts?

21:33.950 --> 21:35.989
And you have to drive to pick
him up.

21:35.990 --> 21:43.990
Any date would be an
acceptable first date.

21:45.120 --> 21:53.120
Oh!
>> Out of all nights, this was

21:57.700 --> 22:03.989
the night to seal that promise
with a kiss.

22:03.990 --> 22:08.119
It was definitely worth the
wait.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.989
The saddest thing about Chloe
is that they ended up on the

22:12.990 --> 22:14.409
block together.

22:14.410 --> 22:18.989
It was a huge moment, and Clay
almost got into it with James.

22:18.990 --> 22:20.119
It was pretty epic.

22:20.120 --> 22:24.989
Why would you tell Johnny
mack that I'm in Shelli's head

22:24.990 --> 22:27.119
and he needs to vote her out
because of me?

22:27.120 --> 22:27.990
I didn't.

22:27.991 --> 22:29.989
Swear.

22:29.990 --> 22:29.991
What?

22:29.991 --> 22:31.989
Who the [Bleep] is lying here.

22:31.990 --> 22:33.989
I would like to confront that
person.

22:33.990 --> 22:34.990
Clay told me that.

22:34.991 --> 22:38.989
He told me Johnny mack told him
that.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.539
That pisses me off.
>> I don't understand.

22:40.540 --> 22:44.989
I'm going to tell Clay to
keep my name out of his mouth.

22:44.990 --> 22:45.990
You know what?

22:45.991 --> 22:51.409
It's time to go confront the big
bad wolf.

22:51.410 --> 22:53.989
I have a big target on my back
and I don't need it.

22:53.990 --> 22:57.989
Clay, I advise you to keep my
name out of your mouth.

22:57.990 --> 22:59.989
You shut up.
>> You shut up.

22:59.990 --> 23:01.989
Unlike you, I'm ready to go.

23:01.990 --> 23:02.830
You are?

23:02.830 --> 23:03.700
Yeah.

23:03.701 --> 23:05.989
But unlike you, I don't have to
lie.

23:05.990 --> 23:05.991
Really?

23:05.991 --> 23:06.990
Really.

23:06.990 --> 23:07.990
How about that?

23:07.991 --> 23:09.989
Walk away from here, dude.

23:09.990 --> 23:11.989
You going to hit me or
something?

23:11.990 --> 23:14.999
Guys, calm down.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.989
Don't do that again.

23:16.990 --> 23:17.990
Thanks, Clay.

23:17.990 --> 23:18.990
You guys calm down.

23:18.991 --> 23:20.990
Don't do that again.

23:31.990 --> 23:34.539
While you guys wouldn't mix
with people we lived with, I

23:34.540 --> 23:35.410
can't believe we made it work.

23:35.411 --> 23:37.989
One of the best things about
Big Brother and what draws me to

23:37.990 --> 23:41.989
this show, there's so many
different types of people that

23:41.990 --> 23:44.949
you would see together that you
never met and you put them in

23:44.950 --> 23:47.989
one environment and mix it up
and see what happens.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.989
Yeah, like Becky.

23:50.990 --> 23:56.989
I can't believe she kicked butt
after all that she had been

23:56.990 --> 23:57.290
through.

23:57.291 --> 24:00.989
I used to be so afraid to
talk to people when I was

24:00.990 --> 24:01.000
younger.

24:01.001 --> 24:02.829
It's so scary.

24:02.830 --> 24:06.989
Even know in the "Big Brother
house" it's so intimidating.

24:06.990 --> 24:08.989
And right now we're roommates.

24:08.990 --> 24:09.990
We live together.

24:09.991 --> 24:11.989
Eventually everybody's life
stories will be out there.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.989
I have a thing to tell you guys.

24:13.990 --> 24:14.990
Of course.

24:14.991 --> 24:17.999
I got hit be by a train last
year while I was walking.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.989
You got hit by a train?

24:19.990 --> 24:21.989
A train?

24:21.990 --> 24:22.290
Yes.

24:22.290 --> 24:23.000
On the tracks?

24:23.001 --> 24:24.989
I don't understand.

24:24.990 --> 24:25.990
How did it hit you?

24:25.990 --> 24:26.990
It was 6:00 A.M.

24:26.991 --> 24:28.119
It was dark out.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.989
I had my hood up.

24:30.990 --> 24:33.949
Right at the corner where I
needed to cross the street is a

24:33.950 --> 24:34.540
big van.

24:34.541 --> 24:38.989
I had walked in front of it,
stuck my head out.

24:38.990 --> 24:39.990
Oh, my gosh.

24:39.991 --> 24:41.699
A train in the face.

24:41.700 --> 24:42.989
The whole front of the train.

24:42.990 --> 24:44.989
The whole front of train.

24:44.990 --> 24:46.989
Literally?

24:46.990 --> 24:51.989
As I put my face hand, I
landed like 15 feet.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.989
I was of course knocked out.

24:54.990 --> 24:58.989
Broke this wrist, part of my
foot.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.989
These two teeth broke out.

25:01.990 --> 25:04.989
This lip had to be sewn back on.

25:04.990 --> 25:09.989
My nose was crushed.

25:09.990 --> 25:10.999
Fractured my skull.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.989
Out of work for eight weeks.

25:13.990 --> 25:18.989
Becky getting hit by a train
is the most insane thing ever.

25:18.990 --> 25:20.989
That chick is super human.

25:20.990 --> 25:22.989
Are you leary of train in
general?

25:22.990 --> 25:24.989
Changed my perspective.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.289
I spent more time with my
family.

25:27.290 --> 25:29.989
Started going to church again.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.989
Picked up a relationship with my
family.

25:31.990 --> 25:32.990
I calmed down.

25:32.990 --> 25:33.990
I've been basic.

25:33.990 --> 25:34.990
Working at the same store.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.949
Your basic bitch.

25:36.950 --> 25:37.989
I really am.

25:37.990 --> 25:43.999
I never heard many my life of
a girl to get hit in the face

25:44.000 --> 25:45.289
with a train.

25:45.290 --> 25:48.989
Someone that can take a train to
the face is definitely somebody

25:48.990 --> 25:52.989
that I can see myself aligning
with and working in this game.

25:52.990 --> 25:56.989
When you call someone a trach
wreck, think of me.

25:56.990 --> 26:02.989
Oh, my gosh!
[Laughter]

26:02.990 --> 26:08.999
Clay was so fine and such a
good guy, but a lot of times he

26:09.000 --> 26:10.989
was so hard to understand.

26:10.990 --> 26:15.949
All you girls were getting lost
in his dreamy eyes and not

26:15.950 --> 26:17.699
listening to the words out of
his mouth.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.989
He mumbled a lot.

26:18.990 --> 26:20.999
He was the mumble master.

26:21.000 --> 26:21.990
Oh, my gosh.

26:21.991 --> 26:24.289
You're saying Mr. perfection
had a flaw?

26:24.290 --> 26:30.119
Oh, yeah.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.989
For sure.

26:31.990 --> 26:32.000
Were you here?

26:32.001 --> 26:33.989
Right here before you.

26:33.990 --> 26:35.989
I was like where did he go?

26:35.990 --> 26:41.539
I told you I was going...
>> I didn't hear you say it.

26:41.540 --> 26:45.989
You mumble a lot, you know.

26:45.990 --> 26:47.989
Do I?

26:47.990 --> 26:50.949
Its dangerous, like
information she acquired from us

26:50.950 --> 26:53.989
is the most dangerous part.

26:53.990 --> 26:57.989
Say that again.

26:57.990 --> 26:58.990
Yeah.

26:58.991 --> 27:04.989
You take a shear?

27:04.990 --> 27:05.990
Yeah.

27:05.991 --> 27:13.991
Jason didn't know...
>> my professional thing is I've

27:18.990 --> 27:21.990
gotten hit one too many times on
that football field.

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
Wow.

27:34.990 --> 27:38.699
[Mumbling].

27:38.700 --> 27:42.989
It's like I'm... and then and
then the next sentence and

27:42.990 --> 27:50.990
then...
>> you get the big picture.

27:58.540 --> 28:02.989
What is really cool, we had
our first trans-gender house

28:02.990 --> 28:03.990
guest, Audrey.

28:03.991 --> 28:06.989
We talked about her story and
how much she had to overcome and

28:06.990 --> 28:07.999
how much rejection she had.

28:08.000 --> 28:14.699
She needed to find who she was
as a person.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.989
That's really cool that you
like came here.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.409
Yeah.

28:19.410 --> 28:21.999
Essentially it's your
philosophy.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.989
This experience, it goes
beyond just myself.

28:28.990 --> 28:29.990
You know?

28:29.991 --> 28:33.989
Representing a suppressed
minority that is on the

28:33.990 --> 28:37.289
forefront of coming out there,
being discussed.

28:37.290 --> 28:37.990
Dissected a little bit.

28:37.991 --> 28:39.289
Transsexual?

28:39.290 --> 28:39.990
Is that the right word?

28:39.991 --> 28:41.699
No.

28:41.700 --> 28:42.989
What is the right word?

28:42.990 --> 28:43.990
Trans-gender.

28:43.991 --> 28:45.289
Trans-gender.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.989
I don't even like that word.

28:46.990 --> 28:47.990
I'm sorry.

28:47.991 --> 28:50.989
That's okay.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.989
What word do you like?

28:52.990 --> 28:55.989
I like "female."

28:55.990 --> 28:59.699
Because to me trans-gender is
like transitioning.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.989
So you were trans-gender for
a while.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.989
Now you're female?

29:03.990 --> 29:05.409
That's the way I feel about it.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.989
A lot of the people that are
going through what I've been

29:07.990 --> 29:10.989
going through, they don't get
the support.

29:10.990 --> 29:13.949
It's something that is very
misunderstood.

29:13.950 --> 29:14.989
It's like you are who you are.

29:14.990 --> 29:16.829
That's who you should be.

29:16.830 --> 29:21.289
I put myself on a platter for
people to judge, to criticize.

29:21.290 --> 29:22.000
I want them to.

29:22.001 --> 29:24.989
As long as they're thinking
about it, there's a part of

29:24.990 --> 29:29.119
their brain that is processing
it.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.989
That's what is important.

29:30.990 --> 29:31.990
You're really brave.

29:31.991 --> 29:37.989
There's a lot of people that are
very... that are very thankful.

29:37.990 --> 29:39.949
They will be very thankful.

29:39.950 --> 29:40.989
Everybody is very brave.

29:40.990 --> 29:43.989
Audrey in the house though,
she left a grand impression.

29:43.990 --> 29:51.990
She stirred up a lot of stuff in
this house that none of us will

29:52.990 --> 29:52.991
ever forget.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.989
This is a perfect opportunity
to bring something up.

29:55.990 --> 29:59.119
I cried this morning.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.989
I was so hurt when you told me
Dave is the one that I'm in an

30:03.990 --> 30:04.290
all-girls alliance.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.989
You told her that?

30:05.990 --> 30:06.990
Let me get this straight.

30:06.991 --> 30:10.989
She comes in her and says that
you told her that I said there

30:10.990 --> 30:12.989
was an all-girls alliance?

30:12.990 --> 30:15.999
They did come from her.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.989
Never said that.

30:19.990 --> 30:20.990
Never said that.

30:20.991 --> 30:23.539
I told her that came out of
your mouth.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.989
I appreciate your coming in
here.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.989
If you don't trust me, that's
fine.

30:28.990 --> 30:31.989
We don't have to pretend to be
friends anymore.

30:31.990 --> 30:34.989
You never said there was an
all-girl alliance and you never

30:34.990 --> 30:37.989
said that Vanessa was at the
forefront of it?

30:37.990 --> 30:38.990
No.

30:38.990 --> 30:39.990
Never.

30:39.990 --> 30:40.990
That's not the truth.

30:40.991 --> 30:41.999
Go for it.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.989
You know that's false.

30:43.990 --> 30:44.990
But game on.

30:44.991 --> 30:50.989
Did she or did she not rally
up all of you and tell you guys

30:50.990 --> 30:55.989
that Vanessa was at the
forefront of this alliance?

30:55.990 --> 30:58.989
When she woke you guys up at
night, what did she say?

30:58.990 --> 31:00.989
That Vanessa was the problem.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.989
Honestly, I don't know what
else to say.

31:03.990 --> 31:04.990
You're two faced.

31:04.991 --> 31:07.539
Seriously?

31:07.540 --> 31:08.989
You said it came from Jay.

31:08.990 --> 31:11.989
You guys with pathological.

31:11.990 --> 31:13.989
You are pathological.

31:13.990 --> 31:17.989
They're making up these
things, telling one person and

31:17.990 --> 31:19.699
telling another person and told
them you said.

31:19.700 --> 31:21.989
You talk same about of everyone.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.989
You...
>> the difference is that I

31:23.990 --> 31:27.989
don't have a mouthpiece to
validate anything that could be

31:27.990 --> 31:28.999
coming out of my mouth.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.989
You two do.

31:30.990 --> 31:35.989
Here is. Strust between them and
everybody and Vanessa.

31:35.990 --> 31:39.989
All the mistrust in this house
has been all implanted by you.

31:39.990 --> 31:42.989
Clearly no matter what I say...

31:42.990 --> 31:44.409
s all from you.

31:44.410 --> 31:47.989
It wasn't from me.

31:47.990 --> 31:49.990
The [Bleep] has hit the fan,
end point, period.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.989
It's time for America's vote.
The Big Brother houseguest

31:57.990 --> 32:03.949

your favorite houseguest

32:13.410 --> 32:16.989

32:16.990 --> 32:19.540
Go to CBS.Com and vote for your
favorite houseguest now!

32:36.990 --> 32:40.989
Living in this house was
absolutely insane, but I think

32:40.990 --> 32:42.999
we had more fun times than bad
times.

32:43.000 --> 32:43.990
For sure.

32:43.991 --> 32:46.989
We had James, the family
prankster.

32:46.990 --> 32:49.989
Nobody could walk around the
corner feeling safe with him

32:49.990 --> 32:49.991
around.

32:49.991 --> 32:53.999
You knew he was waiting to scare
you.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.409
Especially if your name was
Julia.

32:56.410 --> 32:57.120
Thank you.

32:57.121 --> 33:03.989
Back home I'm known as a
practical jokester.

33:03.990 --> 33:10.699
Here at the Big Brother house,
it lightens up the mood a little

33:10.700 --> 33:14.989
bit.

33:14.990 --> 33:15.990
Eases up the spirit.

33:15.991 --> 33:18.699
What the [Bleep] is that?

33:18.700 --> 33:19.410
What?

33:19.411 --> 33:25.989
I heard you tapping.

33:25.990 --> 33:33.990
Is James in here?

33:38.990 --> 33:46.989
What the... [Screaming].

33:46.990 --> 33:48.989
Oh, my God.

33:48.990 --> 33:56.990
I'd rather sit in the corner.

33:59.540 --> 34:07.540
Oh, my gosh!
[Screaming].

34:09.830 --> 34:16.289
What are you doing!
>> Oh, my God!

34:16.290 --> 34:17.699
Stop.

34:17.700 --> 34:22.989
Who is in here?

34:22.990 --> 34:30.990
Arhh!
>> Aghh!

34:31.990 --> 34:34.989
[Screaming [Screaming].

34:34.990 --> 34:36.989
Actually very impressive.

34:36.990 --> 34:40.989
By far one of my favorite
moments is getting these prime

34:40.990 --> 34:41.990
time concert tickets.

34:41.991 --> 34:44.989
You guys had so much fun with
it.

34:44.990 --> 34:49.539
We have one whack street boy
left in the house.

34:49.540 --> 34:50.989
Solo maybe?

34:50.990 --> 34:51.990
It's all me be, be.

34:51.991 --> 34:58.989
Yo, yo, yo!
>> The whack street boys are

34:58.990 --> 34:59.990
here!
>> Hey!

34:59.991 --> 35:01.989
Listen to all this craziness.

35:01.990 --> 35:05.119
I can't stop thinking.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.989
This chinstrap is really working
for me.

35:07.990 --> 35:09.989
Wow!
That is a sweet picture.

35:09.990 --> 35:15.989
I know, right?

35:15.990 --> 35:17.989
So excited.

35:17.990 --> 35:25.990
♪ >> love these guys.

35:27.410 --> 35:32.989
Yeah.

35:32.990 --> 35:36.989
The whack street boys making
all your girls throw your

35:36.990 --> 35:37.950
panties.

35:37.951 --> 35:40.989
Yeah!
>> In the house, we could be

35:40.990 --> 35:41.990
laughing, having games.

35:41.991 --> 35:46.989
But when it comes to the diary
room, there were tears,

35:46.990 --> 35:46.991
screaming.

35:46.991 --> 35:47.990
Everything on line.

35:47.991 --> 35:49.989
Everything people were feeling.

35:49.990 --> 35:54.989
The only place people kept it
real.

35:54.990 --> 35:59.989
I know I kept real in there.
>> I'm not in a good mood.

35:59.990 --> 36:06.989
I'm literally around so much
stupidity that it's making me

36:06.990 --> 36:07.990
sick.

36:07.991 --> 36:13.989
These people are dumb.

36:13.990 --> 36:14.990
These people are dumb.

36:14.991 --> 36:16.989
I don't know what to say
honestly.

36:16.990 --> 36:18.989
You don't like any of these
people.

36:18.990 --> 36:19.990
I know.

36:19.991 --> 36:22.989
Dude, they're all so fake.

36:22.990 --> 36:26.989
"Big Brother" is my life and I
love it so much.

36:26.990 --> 36:30.989
I am the Big Brother homeless
person.

36:30.990 --> 36:38.990
Can we do a two for one and
get rid of kaaudrey and Jake?

36:40.990 --> 36:42.539
I'm just screaming for my mom
right now.

36:42.540 --> 36:47.989
I want to go out with my head
hung high and not do something

36:47.990 --> 36:47.991
impulsive.

36:47.991 --> 36:51.989
I didn't want it.

36:51.990 --> 36:53.949
I did not want that.

36:53.950 --> 36:54.989
Oh, I didn't want this.

36:54.990 --> 36:55.990
I just lost the game.

36:55.991 --> 36:58.989
I just lost the game.

36:58.990 --> 37:03.989
Shut up, dude!
>> I'm a pretty tough girls.

37:03.990 --> 37:06.829
I don't really cry a whole lot.

37:06.830 --> 37:08.989
I'm really horrible at dealing
with emotions.

37:08.990 --> 37:16.990
I'm having a hard time with it.

37:17.990 --> 37:22.989
Oh, good!
These people make me sick.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.989
It's like... [Crying].

37:25.990 --> 37:26.990
I got to get it together.

37:26.991 --> 37:31.989
You guys have footage of
tears in my eyes.

37:31.990 --> 37:33.989
That is pathetic, bro.

37:33.990 --> 37:34.999
It's only day six.

37:35.000 --> 37:41.999
I know it's just a TV show
but I'm personally affected by

37:42.000 --> 37:42.830
this.

37:42.831 --> 37:43.989
Just leave me alone.

37:43.990 --> 37:51.990
I'm just decided I'm going to
withdraw into my little cocoon.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.989
Whoa!
Whoa!

37:58.990 --> 37:59.990
Whatever.

37:59.991 --> 38:01.990
I'll come back when I come back.

38:05.990 --> 38:06.990
Outgoing...

38:08.990 --> 38:09.990
Surprise!

38:10.990 --> 38:11.990
Out spoken!

38:12.990 --> 38:14.289
The most idiotic conversation

38:14.290 --> 38:15.290
then stop having it!

38:15.540 --> 38:16.540
Outragious!

38:20.990 --> 38:23.989
The search is on for the
next Big Brother houseguest!

38:23.990 --> 38:26.699
Oh my gosh, why is everyone so beautiful!

38:26.700 --> 38:28.989
Do you have what it takes to
move in and compete

38:28.990 --> 38:32.829
in a 3 month power struggle
for a half million dollars?

38:32.830 --> 38:33.989
Yes! Yes! Yes!

38:33.990 --> 38:35.990
Go to CBS.Com/big brother for details!

38:42.990 --> 38:45.409
I really do miss Austin though.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.989
It's only been a couple days.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.989
We spent a lot of time in this
house together.

38:48.990 --> 38:52.949
We did have our fair share of
fights.

38:52.950 --> 38:53.989
Well, I didn't miss the food
fight.

38:53.990 --> 38:57.289
That was actually...
>> you're okay...

38:57.290 --> 38:59.989
that was the worst fight by far.

38:59.990 --> 39:01.989
Was that the worst fight?

39:01.990 --> 39:02.999
I think it was the messiest
fight.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.989
Yeah.

39:06.990 --> 39:07.990
Definitely the messiest.

39:07.991 --> 39:10.539
I'm so sick of this chicken.

39:10.540 --> 39:12.989
I never want it again.

39:12.990 --> 39:16.989
What's wrong with it?

39:16.990 --> 39:19.989
These bland chicken breasts
taste the same.

39:19.990 --> 39:27.990
Something wrong with the
marinade?

39:28.990 --> 39:29.990
You don't like the marinade?

39:29.990 --> 39:30.990
No.

39:30.991 --> 39:32.989
You make it yourself next time.

39:32.990 --> 39:33.830
I will.

39:33.831 --> 39:35.539
Why are you being a bitch?

39:35.540 --> 39:35.990
Excuse me?

39:35.990 --> 39:36.990
I'm not being a bitch.

39:36.991 --> 39:38.829
I'm voicing my opinion.

39:38.830 --> 39:40.989
You're not trying to be nice.

39:40.990 --> 39:41.999
I just made this for you.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.990
What?

39:42.991 --> 39:46.119
You said you hate my chicken.

39:46.120 --> 39:46.990
It's not funny.

39:46.991 --> 39:48.989
You called me a bitch.

39:48.990 --> 39:49.990
You're being one.

39:49.991 --> 39:52.949
I'm not a fan.

39:52.950 --> 39:54.989
Your vegetables suck.

39:54.990 --> 39:55.990
I put ketchup in them.

39:55.990 --> 39:56.990
Liar.

39:56.991 --> 39:58.989
I don't think they're very good.

39:58.990 --> 40:00.989
There you go.

40:00.990 --> 40:05.119
That's what you get.

40:05.120 --> 40:05.950
Okay?

40:05.951 --> 40:09.949
You got stuff on your boob.

40:09.950 --> 40:10.989
All right, you guys.

40:10.990 --> 40:11.990
This is it.

40:11.990 --> 40:12.990
We're down to three people.

40:12.991 --> 40:17.119
One person in this room is going
to leave this game with

40:17.120 --> 40:17.990
$500,000.

40:17.991 --> 40:23.829
One is going to leave with
$50,000 and the third person is

40:23.830 --> 40:24.989
going to leave with nothing.

40:24.990 --> 40:25.990
One person wins this game.

40:25.991 --> 40:32.989
The only way to get in the final
spot is to win the h.O.H.

40:32.990 --> 40:32.991
Competition.

40:32.991 --> 40:40.991
Cheers to the final three.

40:41.990 --> 40:45.699
I smell popcorn!
>> Me too!

40:45.700 --> 40:48.829
Whoo-hoo!
>> Oh, my gosh.

40:48.830 --> 40:49.540
Another scary ride.

40:49.541 --> 40:51.989
I walk into the back yard and
I see a carnival.

40:51.990 --> 40:55.989
I see popcorn, I see all the
things you see at a fair and

40:55.990 --> 41:01.949
right in the middle of the yard
are three candy apples I know

41:01.950 --> 41:02.989
we're going to sit on.

41:02.990 --> 41:04.989
This isn't going to be anything
like the fair.

41:04.990 --> 41:09.989
Welcome to part one of the
final head of household

41:09.990 --> 41:10.000
competition.

41:10.001 --> 41:15.949
The winner of this three-part
h.O.H. Will single-handedly

41:15.950 --> 41:23.950
choose who sits next to him or
her on finale night.

41:25.990 --> 41:28.989
The last person on their apple
will win this first part of the

41:28.990 --> 41:31.989
h.O.H. Competition and
automatically advance to part

41:31.989 --> 41:32.000
All right.

41:32.001 --> 41:34.989
It's time to play.

41:34.990 --> 41:42.699
How about dem apples!
>> Yes, how about it?

41:42.700 --> 41:46.989
I've been waiting for this
moment for a long time.

41:46.990 --> 41:49.409
I spent my life dreaming and
playing this game.

41:49.410 --> 41:52.989
The one moment I proudly imagine
myself in the most is this final

41:52.990 --> 41:55.699
three endurance competition.

41:55.700 --> 41:55.990
All right.

41:55.990 --> 41:56.990
Let's do it.

41:56.991 --> 42:03.949
I need to win this final
h.O.H. To guarantee myself a

42:03.950 --> 42:07.949
spot in the final two.

42:07.950 --> 42:08.830
Oh, jeez.

42:08.830 --> 42:09.830
There's stuff in there.

42:09.831 --> 42:11.999
My goal is to get to final
two with Vanessa.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.539
But I also know that I have to
win this h.O.H. Competition for

42:16.540 --> 42:18.989
myself so I can be the decision
maker.

42:18.990 --> 42:24.949
The pressure is on right now.

42:24.950 --> 42:27.949
Turn up!
>> I'm pretty sure that if I win

42:27.950 --> 42:30.989
or Steve wins the h.O.H.,
they'll take me to the final

42:30.990 --> 42:31.290
two.

42:31.291 --> 42:33.989
However, I can't afford to leaf
it to chance.

42:33.990 --> 42:41.989
I have to give it 1,000% and
lock up my own destiny myself.

42:41.990 --> 42:43.989
That was not cool.

42:43.990 --> 42:45.989
Get along, ladies and gentlemen.

42:45.990 --> 42:51.989
Who will win the final
three-part head of household

42:51.990 --> 42:52.990
competition?

42:52.991 --> 42:57.989
Who will the jury crown as "big
brother" and who did make vote

42:57.990 --> 43:00.989
as their favorite house guest?

43:00.990 --> 43:05.989
Find out Wednesday, 9:30/8:30
central immediately following

43:05.990 --> 43:08.990
the premier of "survivor."
