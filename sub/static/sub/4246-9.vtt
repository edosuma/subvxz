WEBVTT

00:01.726 --> 00:02.610
Uh, once again,

00:02.644 --> 00:04.878
some three hours ago,
President Grant was shot.

00:06.012 --> 00:07.346
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:07.364 --> 00:09.065
The FBI is issuing a high alert,

00:09.116 --> 00:11.984
and they... they do have
a description of a suspect.

00:12.118 --> 00:13.786
- Ms. Pope?
- Yes.

00:14.304 --> 00:15.420
- Are you... back?
- Yes.

00:15.454 --> 00:18.023
I'm back,
for as long as you need me.

00:18.057 --> 00:19.842
The vice President is making a play.

00:19.893 --> 00:21.226
She spent the last two hours
lobbying cabinet members

00:21.261 --> 00:24.096
- about signing over the
presidency to her. - She what?

00:24.130 --> 00:26.231
(Reed) President Sally
Langston makes history today

00:26.266 --> 00:28.917
as the first female
commander in chief.

00:30.570 --> 00:32.020
<i>Good morning.</i>

00:32.070 --> 00:33.655
<i>First, let me say</i>
<i>that all that I have</i>

00:33.690 --> 00:36.107
<i>I would give</i>
<i>not to be here today.</i>

00:36.125 --> 00:37.960
<i>Like all of you,</i>
<i>my thoughts and prayers</i>

00:38.011 --> 00:40.846
<i>are with the President</i>
<i>and his wife and children.</i>

00:40.880 --> 00:43.215
<i>The doctors at James Madison</i>
<i>hospital have informed me</i>

00:43.249 --> 00:46.851
<i>that President Grant's</i>
<i>condition remains critical.</i>

00:46.870 --> 00:50.289
<i>The doctors have been candid,</i>
<i>and I will be, too.</i>

00:50.323 --> 00:53.659
<i>They hope the President will</i>
<i>wake up within a few days.</i>

00:53.693 --> 00:56.294
<i>If and when he does,</i>
<i>they may not know</i>

00:56.312 --> 00:58.063
<i>the extent of the damage</i>
<i>to his brain</i>

00:58.097 --> 01:01.433
<i>for at least a couple of weeks,</i>
<i>maybe longer.</i>

01:01.451 --> 01:03.669
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>we have extended the manhunt</i>

01:03.703 --> 01:05.587
<i>for the person</i>
<i>or persons responsible</i>

01:05.622 --> 01:07.539
<i>for the attack</i>
<i>on the President.</i>

01:07.557 --> 01:10.842
<i>I have directed the leaders</i>
<i>of the FBI, Homeland Security,</i>

01:10.860 --> 01:13.295
<i>and the CIA to pursue</i>
<i>every avenue,</i>

01:13.329 --> 01:14.846
<i>run every threat to ground,</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:17.616
<i>until we have captured</i>
<i>whoever is responsible</i>

01:17.650 --> 01:19.701
<i>for this evil act.</i>
(Breaths heavily)

01:20.786 --> 01:22.253
The person they're looking for,

01:22.287 --> 01:25.172
the one they think
shot the President...

01:25.207 --> 01:26.307
That's me.

01:30.178 --> 01:32.363

Sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

01:36.201 --> 01:39.370
I'm gonna need to talk to
Colonel Jessup over at M.D.W.

01:39.404 --> 01:41.489
He's the chief of ceremonies
and special events.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.440
Call D.H.S. and justice.
(Cell phone ringing)

01:43.458 --> 01:45.776
Tell them to be here
at 1:00 P.M. for a briefing.

01:45.811 --> 01:47.428
Hold on. What?

01:47.462 --> 01:48.846
- You need to get back here.
- I can't.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.197
In fact, I'm staying on
for a while longer.

01:50.248 --> 01:52.016
- I'm not asking.
- Whatever it is, deal with it.

01:52.050 --> 01:53.484
- I'm not asking.
- What is it?

01:54.820 --> 01:56.037
Can't say. Open line.

01:56.071 --> 01:57.388
Harrison, I'm in the middle
of something.

01:57.422 --> 01:58.472
I will call you...

01:58.507 --> 02:00.274
Get your ass back here <i>now.</i>

02:03.245 --> 02:04.378
(Cell phone beeps)

02:04.413 --> 02:06.464
I'll be back in an hour.

02:06.498 --> 02:08.733
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

02:15.789 --> 02:16.373
Huck.

02:17.508 --> 02:19.826
I think she relapsed.
We need to find her.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.394
You have to help me.

02:21.428 --> 02:23.996
(Voice echoing) I messed up.
I'm in trouble, Huck.

02:24.031 --> 02:26.315
I mean, you have to come.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.951
She's in
a lot of trouble.

02:28.018 --> 02:29.569
When did Becky call you?

02:29.620 --> 02:32.554
Oh. Yesterday or the day before.
I was talking to Quinn.

02:32.672 --> 02:35.041
<i>It was registered</i>
<i>to Verna Thornton.</i>

02:35.075 --> 02:36.626
<i>The supreme court justice?</i>

02:37.160 --> 02:38.777
<i>She's one of Olivia's clients,</i>
<i>right?</i>

02:38.812 --> 02:40.479
(Cell phone rings)

02:40.513 --> 02:41.680
(Ring)

02:41.731 --> 02:44.083
(Beep)

02:44.834 --> 02:46.001
Becky? What's wrong?

02:46.035 --> 02:48.102
She was crying, scared.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.220
I don't know what to do.

02:49.255 --> 02:50.822
Can you come get me, please?

02:50.873 --> 02:53.024
She gave me a room number,
and I went.

02:53.075 --> 02:53.992
To the Stanworth.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.794
Room 807.

02:55.828 --> 02:57.545
<i>Uh, the door was open.</i>

02:57.580 --> 02:59.297
(Knock on door)

03:02.517 --> 03:03.300
Becky?

03:03.335 --> 03:04.635
<i>But she wasn't there.</i>

03:10.609 --> 03:14.095
(Beeps and whirs)

03:14.129 --> 03:15.980
(Multiple gunshots)

03:16.031 --> 03:17.465
(Crowd screaming)

03:18.299 --> 03:20.200
I'm new to the field of
remote-controlled sniper rifles.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.185
Is there a trade magazine
they send out to enthusiasts,

03:22.220 --> 03:23.987
psychopaths, assassins?

03:24.422 --> 03:26.089
There's a camera
in the scope.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.441
The movement operates
on a radio signal.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.910
It's the same technology you use
to fly model airplanes.

03:30.928 --> 03:33.279
You can find it at any
toy store, electronics store.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.613
It's untraceable.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.581
What's its range?

03:35.599 --> 03:37.467
Depends on
if they bounce the signal.

03:37.501 --> 03:40.653
It could be 50 feet,
it could be 2 states away.

03:40.687 --> 03:41.838
What did you do?

03:41.872 --> 03:43.656
What I'm trained to do.

<i>I couldn't find</i>
<i>the fifth cartridge,</i>

03:55.585 --> 03:57.035
<i>but I couldn't spare</i>
<i>another second,</i>

03:57.069 --> 03:58.171
<i>so I ran down the stairs</i>

03:58.205 --> 04:00.289
<i>and snuck out</i>
<i>of the service entrance.</i>

04:00.340 --> 04:02.040
(Alarm blaring) Why disable the gun?
Why take it?

04:02.074 --> 04:03.542
If someone found you with it...

04:03.576 --> 04:05.427
It could help us find who did
this and who took Becky.

04:05.461 --> 04:07.095
Every gun has a story.

04:07.130 --> 04:08.747
What did you do with it?

04:17.023 --> 04:18.607
So that's the...

04:18.641 --> 04:20.309
That's the gun
that shot the President.

04:31.867 --> 04:35.284
Rebecca Flynn...
Born January 17, 1982.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.385
Freelance graphic designer.

04:36.419 --> 04:38.020
Works out of a shared space
on 9th street.

04:38.054 --> 04:40.923
Attends A.A. meetings
at a church on Florida Avenue.

04:40.957 --> 04:42.490
- It's where we met.
- She's an alcoholic?

04:42.509 --> 04:44.159
- Cocaine.
- You're an alcoholic?

04:44.177 --> 04:46.962
I have an addiction,
but not to drugs or alcohol.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.430
(Olivia) When was the
last time you saw her?

04:48.464 --> 04:49.798
Thursday morning.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.767
- You've known her for how long?
- Three months.

04:51.801 --> 04:53.552
Huck, I know you love this girl,
but I have to ask...

04:53.603 --> 04:56.104
Is there any chance she was
involved in setting you up?

04:56.139 --> 04:57.639
No.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.674
I'm trained to detect lying,
and all that aside, I know her.

04:59.692 --> 05:01.443
I know she would
never do that to me.

05:01.477 --> 05:03.345
Never. She's in trouble.
Someone grabbed her

05:03.363 --> 05:05.898
to lure her to that hotel.
They knew I would come for her.

05:05.949 --> 05:06.649
Someone has her.

05:06.683 --> 05:09.117
Someone professional
who kills for a living,

05:09.152 --> 05:11.787
who's good enough to do it
with a remote sniper rifle.

05:11.821 --> 05:13.855
Someone like you?
That's what you mean, right?

05:13.873 --> 05:15.490
- Someone like you.
- Quinn.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.793
I need to find Becky before
they decide she's disposable.

05:17.827 --> 05:18.911
And...

05:18.962 --> 05:21.529
She's a nice person.

05:21.548 --> 05:23.248
- I need to find her.
- Okay. So we find her,

05:23.299 --> 05:25.083
connect the dots,
find out who she talked to,

05:25.134 --> 05:26.151
- where she went.
-I'm going, too.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.703
- No. You stay here.
- There's no way in hell.

05:27.737 --> 05:29.021
You're the most wanted man
in America.

05:29.072 --> 05:30.973
The FBI has sketches of you
everywhere. You stay here.

05:30.991 --> 05:33.742
You do not move.
You do not leave this office.

05:33.777 --> 05:35.978
Huck, look at me.

05:35.996 --> 05:37.112
Look at me.

05:38.949 --> 05:40.699
Do not leave this office.

05:42.118 --> 05:45.504
The FBI sketch is based
on one individual's description

05:45.539 --> 05:47.339
on what is being described
thus far

05:47.374 --> 05:49.425
as a person of interest
in the events surrounding

05:49.459 --> 05:52.261
the shooting of President Grant
and Britta Kagen.

05:52.295 --> 05:53.996
For further details
on the investigation,

05:54.014 --> 05:55.831
I'd like to turn the podium over

05:55.849 --> 05:57.716
to the Attorney General
and her team of investigators.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.802
(Camera shutters clicking)

06:00.236 --> 06:01.670
David.

06:01.704 --> 06:03.238
The sketch is the result
of an eyewitness

06:03.256 --> 06:04.906
who saw the suspect
with a red hoodie

06:04.924 --> 06:06.875
pull the fire alarm
on the eighth floor.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.576
We are going through
hotel security footage now

06:08.595 --> 06:09.995
to look for leads.

06:10.029 --> 06:12.080
<i>Facial recognition software is</i>
<i>being used</i>

06:12.098 --> 06:14.633
<i>to seek a match</i>
<i>with every record available.</i>

06:14.684 --> 06:17.085
I'm leaving the cabinet briefings

06:17.103 --> 06:19.855
and the White House
schedule on your desk.

06:19.889 --> 06:22.691
Also the minutes from
yesterday's N.S.A. meetings.

06:22.725 --> 06:24.393
I figure I would patch you

06:24.427 --> 06:26.594
- into the White House for any intel
updates. - Don't bother.

06:26.613 --> 06:29.398
Just because President Langston...
I'm sorry.

06:29.432 --> 06:32.401
Just because that woman
kicked you out of your office,

06:32.435 --> 06:33.568
doesn't mean you can't move

06:33.602 --> 06:34.870
to another office
in the White House.

06:34.904 --> 06:36.955
I have another office, Mary.
You're standing in it.

06:36.990 --> 06:39.658
And I'm not leaving here
until President Grant...

06:39.709 --> 06:40.942
The only President
of this great nation...

06:40.960 --> 06:42.777
leaves his hospital bed.
(Telephone ringing)

06:42.795 --> 06:45.080
<i>(Woman) That the shooter</i>
<i>most likely has...</i>

06:45.114 --> 06:47.049
- Are you getting that?
- No.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.668
- Mary. - That's your home phone.
I don't answer your home phone.

06:49.719 --> 06:52.387
Because unlike you,
I still work at the White House.

06:52.422 --> 06:54.056
(Door opens)
(Ring)

06:54.090 --> 06:55.841
Okay. (Mutters)

06:55.892 --> 06:57.259
(Ring)

06:57.293 --> 06:58.393
Hello?

06:58.428 --> 07:00.646
Mrs. Novak?

07:00.680 --> 07:03.348
No. I'm not at work.

07:03.399 --> 07:04.399
(Coughs)

07:04.434 --> 07:06.968
Yes, I... (Sighs)

07:06.986 --> 07:08.236
Yes, I know with everything
that's going on,

07:08.271 --> 07:10.038
you would think they
need me, but they don't.

07:10.073 --> 07:12.941
So I have time to talk to my
very favorite mother-in-law.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.344
Yes, I hope the President
pulls through, too.

07:15.378 --> 07:17.629
No. James isn't here right now.
He's at work.

07:17.664 --> 07:19.831
Yeah. They need him at work.

07:19.866 --> 07:21.616
Did you want me
to give him a message?

07:21.634 --> 07:25.754
His next visit? I don't know.
Probably not for a while.

07:25.788 --> 07:28.974
Because he was just up there
last weekend.

07:29.008 --> 07:33.178
James did not come and visit you
and his dad this past weekend?

07:34.347 --> 07:36.515
No.

07:36.549 --> 07:39.067
I guess that's my mistake.

07:39.102 --> 07:40.736
Yes.

07:40.770 --> 07:43.922
I'll have him call as soon
as he gets back home.

07:45.056 --> 07:47.024
<i>I'm standing in your cubicle.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

07:47.058 --> 07:48.309
<i>Oh, my dad's having</i>
<i>one of those days</i>

07:48.343 --> 07:49.794
<i>where he thinks</i>
<i>I'm his Uncle krystof.</i>

07:49.828 --> 07:52.113
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>Anything I can do?</i>

07:52.147 --> 07:53.280
<i>No. If it's okay with you,</i>
<i>though,</i>

07:53.315 --> 07:54.381
<i>I think I'll spend</i>
<i>the night here.</i>

07:54.416 --> 07:55.549
<i>No. No. Of course.</i>

07:55.584 --> 07:56.684
<i>Yeah. Whatever you need.</i>

07:56.718 --> 07:57.885
<i>Thanks.</i>

07:59.254 --> 08:00.554
Bye.

08:00.589 --> 08:02.890
(Beep)

08:04.124 --> 08:05.225
James.

08:05.259 --> 08:06.326
David, hey.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.578
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.313
You told me last night you found
something in Ohio, but you

08:09.347 --> 08:11.465
didn't say what it was, and now
you're not returning my calls.

08:11.799 --> 08:12.834
Is it something about Cytron?

08:12.868 --> 08:15.135
- Look, I-I really can't talk about
this right now. - Why?

08:15.169 --> 08:16.386
Because it's complicated,

08:16.437 --> 08:19.139
especially...
Especially in light of this.

08:19.173 --> 08:20.506
The assassination attempt?

08:20.525 --> 08:22.459
I know that it sounds vague,
but you just have to trust me.

08:22.493 --> 08:23.977
Fine. But if it has
anything to do

08:24.011 --> 08:26.046
with the President getting shot,
anything at all...

08:26.480 --> 08:27.814
You'll be the first to know.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.451
Madam President,
I am humbled

08:32.485 --> 08:34.035
and truly honored
to stand before

08:34.071 --> 08:37.089
the first female President
of these United States.

08:37.124 --> 08:37.941
Very kind.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.393
Ma'am, I'm not one to
speak out of school, but...

08:40.427 --> 08:41.844
Oh, well, hell...
Excuse my French.

08:41.878 --> 08:43.996
We both know if I'm breathing,
I'm speaking out of school,

08:44.014 --> 08:45.564
but it's my pure belief

08:45.598 --> 08:48.367
you didn't get your
proper due as V.P.

08:48.902 --> 08:50.018
There. Said.

08:50.053 --> 08:52.871
Well, my position has had
its, uh, challenges.

08:52.906 --> 08:55.507
Now can we get
to your business, Hollis?

08:55.541 --> 08:57.943
Whatever stretch
the almighty has in mind

08:57.977 --> 08:59.844
for you to now lead
this great land...

08:59.863 --> 09:02.414
Be it a week, a month,
or longer...

09:02.432 --> 09:04.032
You were put here
for a purpose,

09:04.067 --> 09:05.617
sure as he made the world.

09:05.635 --> 09:08.937
And that purpose is to make
yourself some history.

09:08.988 --> 09:11.240
That is,
if you're so inclined.

09:12.609 --> 09:15.911
Might be time to pay a visit
to Verna Thornton.

09:17.763 --> 09:20.064
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:20.682 --> 09:23.067
Nothing knocked over
or even askew.

09:23.302 --> 09:25.469
If Becky was abducted,
it wasn't from here.

09:25.704 --> 09:27.171
Still holding?

09:27.205 --> 09:28.806
The President was shot. They're
a little busy at justice.

09:28.940 --> 09:30.591
But don't worry. My guy's solid.
Owes me big-time.

09:30.642 --> 09:34.077
Yeah, Jim. Listen, that security
footage at the Stanworth hotel

09:34.095 --> 09:35.929
before and after the shooting...
I'm gonna need a copy.

09:35.963 --> 09:37.347
So I'm gonna have to call in
that favor.

09:37.365 --> 09:39.883
Dude, I made that D.U.I.
go away. I saved you 12 grand.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.568
No, this is exactly
the kind of thing

09:41.602 --> 09:43.152
people mean when they say,
"I owe you."

09:43.170 --> 09:44.788
Wait. Wait.

09:44.822 --> 09:46.156
(Beep)
He hung up.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.474
- Wow. Mr. Big time.
- They're on lockdown.

09:48.477 --> 09:50.328
They're not releasing anything
to anyone for any reason.

09:51.062 --> 09:53.514
I may have someone I can call.

09:54.448 --> 09:56.499
(Keyboard keys clicking)

09:56.533 --> 09:58.067
Any luck with
the hotel security feed?

09:58.101 --> 10:00.453
Uh, the FBI pulled it.
I'm seeing if they have it cached.

10:00.487 --> 10:03.006
(Sighs) So I guess
we're both patsies then.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.159
Me for the Cytron explosion,
you for shooting the President.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.328
Makes you wonder
if they're related.

10:08.362 --> 10:09.280
What do you mean?

10:09.313 --> 10:11.113
I mean, whoever set me up
for the Cytron explosion

10:11.114 --> 10:13.416
must've been pretty unhappy
I slipped through their fingers.

10:13.950 --> 10:15.401
If they knew you were the guy
who took me,

10:15.435 --> 10:17.720
first of all, they'd be pissed,
but more importantly,

10:17.754 --> 10:20.322
if they did their homework,
they'd know you were ex-CIA,

10:20.340 --> 10:21.674
and who better to pin
an assassination on

10:21.708 --> 10:23.775
than someone who's been tossed
aside by the government?

10:23.826 --> 10:26.361
So who were they, Huck?
Who set me up?

10:26.379 --> 10:28.263
- I don't know. - You don't know
because you never asked

10:28.281 --> 10:29.331
or you don't know
because you're still

10:29.366 --> 10:30.866
pretending it wasn't you

10:30.901 --> 10:32.768
who flew me cross-country
in Verna Thornton's jet

10:32.786 --> 10:35.137
and dumped me in a D.C. hotel
room with a brand-new identity?

10:35.155 --> 10:36.739
I never asked.

10:37.373 --> 10:40.258
(Computer beeping)

10:40.293 --> 10:44.646
A woman tells you to kidnap
someone and you don't ask why?

10:45.164 --> 10:47.332
Is Olivia Pope really worth
that kind of loyalty?

10:47.366 --> 10:49.450
My girlfriend is missing,
and I'm trying to find her.

10:49.484 --> 10:50.751
Are you gonna help me or not?

10:50.769 --> 10:54.088
(Typing on keyboard)

10:58.961 --> 10:59.927
Hey.

10:59.961 --> 11:01.496
Hey.

11:02.931 --> 11:06.099
Hotel security footage
for the last 72 hours.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.385
(Sets flash drive down)

11:20.765 --> 11:21.898
Thanks.

11:41.018 --> 11:43.036
(Door opens and closes)

11:43.370 --> 11:45.421
I mean, Becky's only been
at her job for three months.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.123
Her credit cards...
All opened three months ago.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.808
And get this, she's been
dating Huck for exactly...

11:48.842 --> 11:50.476
Three months.

11:51.828 --> 11:53.763
Abby, what is it?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.663
She went into the hotel alone.

12:12.782 --> 12:14.766
Well, she could have been
meeting her dealer upstairs.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.517
No way to tell.

12:15.552 --> 12:17.703
Security cameras on the eighth
floor were all messed with.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.154
Huck, I checked her phone.

12:19.189 --> 12:20.873
No calls to or from any dealers

12:20.907 --> 12:22.975
or anyone, for that matter.
Only you, Huck.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.542
For the entire three months
she had that phone,

12:24.576 --> 12:25.760
she only called you.

12:25.795 --> 12:27.429
That doesn't prove anything.
She was getting sober.

12:27.464 --> 12:29.981
She left her whole life behind
and moved here to get sober.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.267
- She doesn't have a lot of friends.
- We checked her bank statements.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.636
She kept exactly the amount she
needed to pay rent and utilities

12:34.670 --> 12:36.537
in that account.
Never wrote any other checks.

12:36.572 --> 12:38.190
Huck...

12:39.224 --> 12:40.308
Becky doesn't exist.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.826
Yes, she does.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.645
- She set you up, Huck.
- No, she'd never do that.

12:43.979 --> 12:45.963
- I'm sorry.
- You made a mistake.

12:45.998 --> 12:47.965
- I'm gonna find her.
- Olivia said you don't leave here.

12:47.983 --> 12:49.367
- Who's gonna stop me?
- You don't leave here.

12:49.401 --> 12:50.785
I am a trained killer.

12:50.819 --> 12:52.303
Do you understand that?

12:52.537 --> 12:54.656
You leave here,
you gotta go through me.

12:56.475 --> 12:57.759
You missed something.

12:57.793 --> 13:01.279
You are wrong about Becky,
so you are of no help to me.

13:01.313 --> 13:02.413
None of you.

13:02.447 --> 13:04.398
I'm taking care of this myself.

13:13.942 --> 13:16.577
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

13:35.514 --> 13:37.648
(Thudding)

13:37.683 --> 13:40.418
(Hollow thud)

13:58.586 --> 14:01.855
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

14:03.248 --> 14:05.716
(Projector clicks)

14:05.750 --> 14:06.934
(Click)

14:11.523 --> 14:12.523
(Click)

14:14.193 --> 14:15.193
(Click)

14:25.762 --> 14:27.179
(Click)

14:42.807 --> 14:45.258
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:45.293 --> 14:47.344
Madam President.

14:47.378 --> 14:48.812
Hello, justice Thornton.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.430
I heard you were feeling
under the weather.

14:50.465 --> 14:51.598
Though "under the weather"

14:51.632 --> 14:54.234
really doesn't quite
cover it, does it?

14:57.972 --> 14:59.189
Is there something
I can do for you?

14:59.223 --> 15:00.673
You can take care of yourself,

15:00.708 --> 15:02.125
for your own good,

15:02.159 --> 15:03.326
for the good of the country.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.061
You can focus on your health,

15:05.095 --> 15:07.197
concentrate your energies
on getting better.

15:07.231 --> 15:09.465
Such a stressful job
can't be good for you

15:09.499 --> 15:10.233
at a time like this.

15:10.251 --> 15:12.352
I am not stepping down
from the bench.

15:12.986 --> 15:16.538
Justice Thornton, your President
is making a request of you.

15:16.573 --> 15:19.074
Wouldn't be patriotic
not to acquiesce.

15:19.092 --> 15:22.327
You're gonna be President
for about the next 15 minutes

15:22.362 --> 15:23.595
and then your time
will be done,

15:23.630 --> 15:25.364
and I will be still be
on the bench.

15:25.398 --> 15:28.117
If I have to rule from
the confines of an iron lung,

15:28.151 --> 15:30.502
I will be on the bench.

15:30.637 --> 15:32.954
The seat your butt is filling
on the supreme court

15:32.988 --> 15:35.290
belongs to me to fill
as I see fit.

15:35.324 --> 15:37.258
It was promised to me
during the campaign.

15:37.293 --> 15:39.627
It is mine,
and I mean to have it,

15:39.645 --> 15:42.063
and for someone other than
a left-wing, baby-killing,

15:42.097 --> 15:45.233
homosexual loving, godless
creature such as yourself.

15:45.267 --> 15:47.152
I want it now,
and you will give it to me,

15:47.186 --> 15:48.653
because if you don't,

15:48.704 --> 15:51.388
I will leak to one of
your liberal media papers

15:51.423 --> 15:52.774
that you have terminal cancer,

15:52.808 --> 15:55.909
that you had terminal cancer
during the confirmation hearings,

15:55.927 --> 15:58.795
that you lied by omission
about having terminal cancer

15:58.847 --> 16:00.247
to the American people,

16:00.565 --> 16:03.033
that the drugs coursing
through your system...

16:03.067 --> 16:06.736
Including the medical marijuana
pills you take at night...

16:06.771 --> 16:09.940
May possibly have clouded
your judicial judgment.

16:09.974 --> 16:13.093
I will call into question every
decision you have ever made

16:13.127 --> 16:15.462
from the bench of
the highest court in the land.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.980
I will disgrace you
in the eyes of your peers

16:17.014 --> 16:18.698
and in the annals of history.

16:18.732 --> 16:21.785
I will ruin what little time
you have left on this earth,

16:21.819 --> 16:23.003
and I will be right to do so

16:23.037 --> 16:25.021
because it is
the God's honest truth.

16:30.311 --> 16:32.429
Step down from the bench, Verna.

16:32.463 --> 16:35.248
I'm asking you nicely.

16:38.569 --> 16:39.669
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

16:40.704 --> 16:42.304
It's nice that you
came home for lunch.

16:42.339 --> 16:44.974
Well, I have to admit,
I was a little worried

16:45.025 --> 16:46.158
about what I might find
when I came home.

16:46.192 --> 16:47.443
I mean, it's been four hours

16:47.477 --> 16:48.694
without a political hit
in your veins.

16:48.728 --> 16:49.979
Thought you might be huddled
in the corner,

16:50.030 --> 16:52.797
mainlining c-span and trying
to snort shredded pieces

16:52.832 --> 16:53.932
of the congressional record
up your nose.

16:53.950 --> 16:56.201
- But you're fine.
- Oh, I'm good. I'm very good.

16:56.219 --> 16:58.004
A little time off was
just what I needed.

16:59.238 --> 17:01.757
So...

17:02.108 --> 17:03.708
H-how did you say
your dad was doing?

17:03.743 --> 17:05.376
- Hmm?
- Your dad.

17:05.394 --> 17:07.444
You had to spend that night
at his house the other day.

17:07.479 --> 17:08.663
And we never had a chance
to talk about it,

17:08.698 --> 17:10.699
because, well,
all hell broke loose

17:10.733 --> 17:12.267
with Fitz and the shooting,

17:12.318 --> 17:15.303
so I was wondering, how is
your father doing? Better?

17:15.338 --> 17:16.637
Worse?

17:16.672 --> 17:18.089
Oh, about the same, I guess.

17:18.107 --> 17:19.790
This could really use
some mustard. You want?

17:19.825 --> 17:22.093
No, I'm good.

17:46.618 --> 17:48.152
There. That's him.

17:48.170 --> 17:50.337
Same red sweatshirt as the man
seen pulling the fire alarm.

17:50.389 --> 17:52.022
And he's heading up
to the eighth floor,

17:52.040 --> 17:53.758
which is where the shots
were fired from.

17:53.792 --> 17:56.043
- But no clear angle on his face?
- No clear angle on his face,

17:56.077 --> 17:57.895
and the cameras on the eighth
floor were tampered with,

17:57.929 --> 18:00.681
so we don't have any footage of
him from there. However, ma'am,

18:00.715 --> 18:02.366
if you'll focus your attention
back on the monitor...

18:04.969 --> 18:07.871
There. See? He picks up
that woman's cell phone.

18:07.905 --> 18:09.973
And presumably left
his fingerprints on it.

18:10.607 --> 18:11.941
Have you located
the woman yet?

18:11.959 --> 18:13.560
We're looking for her now.

18:16.197 --> 18:17.447
Huck's fingerprints...

18:17.481 --> 18:19.666
Find out if they're
in any government databases.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.334
- Okay, but first...
- The FBI has

18:21.368 --> 18:22.969
security footage of Huck
picking up someone's phone

18:23.003 --> 18:24.587
in the hotel elevator.

18:24.605 --> 18:25.889
- Okay, but...
- If they find the phone, they'll have

18:25.923 --> 18:28.858
his prints, so we need to know if
they'll be able to match them.

18:28.876 --> 18:30.526
If that's the case, we track
down this woman and take

18:30.544 --> 18:32.145
her phone before the FBI
can get their hands on it.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.896
Liv, Huck's gone.

18:33.914 --> 18:34.964
What?

18:39.703 --> 18:42.572
(Girls speaking indistinctly)

18:43.974 --> 18:45.475
(Girls laugh)

18:48.061 --> 18:51.196
<i>Sundays is pasta</i>
<i>and mondays is sandwiches,</i>

18:51.231 --> 18:53.098
<i>but tonight...</i>
<i>Tonight's my favorite night.</i>

18:53.133 --> 18:55.868
<i>They eat pizza</i>
<i>and they play games.</i>

18:55.919 --> 18:58.003
<i>That's the best part.</i>
<i>It's game night.</i>

18:59.038 --> 19:00.688
<i>She's Carol, 34,</i>

19:00.723 --> 19:03.041
<i>not a natural blonde,</i>
<i>but that's okay.</i>

19:03.075 --> 19:05.643
<i>She teaches math</i>
<i>at the junior high.</i>

19:05.678 --> 19:08.529
<i>And he's Billy.</i>
<i>He sells sporting goods,</i>

19:08.564 --> 19:10.865
<i>which is an actual thing...</i>
<i>Sporting goods.</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:12.233
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

19:12.268 --> 19:14.652
<i>And the little girls</i>
<i>are Lucy... she's 8,</i>

19:14.687 --> 19:17.372
<i>and Sarah Beth... she's 10.</i>

19:17.406 --> 19:18.856
<i>So what about you?</i>

19:18.891 --> 19:20.441
<i>What do you like to do?</i>

19:38.844 --> 19:42.463
(Billy chuckles)
Let me get that.

19:52.591 --> 19:53.775
(Rustling)

19:53.809 --> 19:55.777
(Gun cocks)

19:58.479 --> 19:59.580
Hi, Huck.

20:11.306 --> 20:12.756
What, you're not speaking to me now?

20:12.790 --> 20:14.041
- You set me up.
- Yeah, I set you up.

20:14.875 --> 20:15.808
Who hired you?

20:15.843 --> 20:17.143
You know I can't tell you that.

20:17.194 --> 20:19.712
Professional ethics.
Gal's gotta have standards.

20:19.746 --> 20:20.763
Who are you?

20:20.797 --> 20:23.949
I'm Becky, like "Rebecca
of Sunnybrook Farm."

20:23.984 --> 20:26.535
Nice to meet you, Huck
of "Huckleberry Finn."

20:26.569 --> 20:27.869
Is today the day
I'm gonna die?

20:27.904 --> 20:29.321
Because I'd like to know
ahead of time.

20:29.355 --> 20:30.956
I'm not here to kill you.
Why would I kill you?

20:30.990 --> 20:32.841
We're the same, you and me.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.327
Except that I shot the President.
That's a big job.

20:35.361 --> 20:36.778
You want me to go down for this.

20:36.813 --> 20:38.680
Come on. Don't you think if I
wanted you to go down for this,

20:38.715 --> 20:39.865
you'd be in lockdown

20:39.899 --> 20:41.900
in the deepest, darkest hole
in gitmo by now?

20:41.951 --> 20:44.251
Sweetie, I could've paid
for that hotel room

20:44.286 --> 20:45.086
with your credit card.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.021
I could've spread your D.N.A.
all over that place.

20:47.055 --> 20:48.456
I could've killed you,
made it look like

20:48.490 --> 20:51.075
you shot the President
and then yourself. But I didn't.

20:51.109 --> 20:53.494
I was supposed to, but I didn't.

20:53.529 --> 20:54.629
How come?

20:54.663 --> 20:55.780
Because I like you, Huck.

20:55.814 --> 20:57.899
- You shot the President.
- So?

20:57.933 --> 21:01.068
- Becky... - You were in B613.
You killed three world leaders.

21:01.102 --> 21:02.370
Made 'em look like
heart attacks,

21:02.404 --> 21:03.804
but still, three.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.223
I shoot one a few times,

21:05.257 --> 21:07.491
and you're suddenly
better than me?

21:08.426 --> 21:09.659
What, I thought you were in A.A.

21:09.694 --> 21:11.178
because you like
to collect chips?

21:11.212 --> 21:12.496
You like to kill people.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.981
It's what you do.
It's who you are.

21:15.016 --> 21:17.701
Look, you're mad right now
because I had you,

21:17.735 --> 21:19.469
because you let your guard down,
and I fooled you.

21:19.504 --> 21:22.255
But, Huck,
you're missing the point.

21:22.290 --> 21:24.474
We're alike.
You're like me.

21:24.509 --> 21:26.343
We're the same.

21:26.377 --> 21:29.229
We're built for each other.

21:30.063 --> 21:31.764
So you can sit here every night

21:31.798 --> 21:35.268
and watch your little family
eat their sandwiches,

21:35.302 --> 21:37.803
or you can come with me.

21:37.838 --> 21:38.971
Come with me.

21:39.005 --> 21:40.222
I'm leaving town.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.424
We could go on the run,

21:41.458 --> 21:44.343
do the whole
Bonnie-and-Clyde-for-hire thing.

21:44.377 --> 21:45.294
Just you and me.

21:45.829 --> 21:47.312
Think about it, Huck.

21:50.283 --> 21:52.651
(Kisses)

21:52.685 --> 21:54.736
You know where to find me.

21:57.257 --> 21:59.308
(Car door opens)

21:59.359 --> 22:02.661
(Car door closes)

22:02.679 --> 22:03.796
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

22:04.630 --> 22:05.997
(Doorbell rings)

22:09.351 --> 22:11.569
'94 Du Bellay Chateauneuf du Pape.

22:11.604 --> 22:13.354
Wow.
What's the occasion?

22:13.389 --> 22:15.573
My husband is
cheating on me.

22:21.013 --> 22:23.982
What did he say?

22:24.016 --> 22:25.617
I'm not asking him.

22:25.651 --> 22:28.620
He's lying to me about
visiting his parents.

22:28.654 --> 22:29.954
He loves you.

22:29.989 --> 22:32.173
He's much younger than me
and very handsome

22:32.207 --> 22:33.608
and a bit of a slut.

22:33.642 --> 22:35.326
(Laughs) Cyrus.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.361
Before he met me,
he was a bit of a slut,

22:37.379 --> 22:39.980
which I found very sexy,
and I shouldn't have,

22:40.032 --> 22:42.833
because now my young,
handsome, slutty husband

22:42.867 --> 22:44.769
is cheating on me, and I am
going to grow old alone.

22:44.803 --> 22:47.571
You don't know for sure
he's cheating.

22:48.206 --> 22:49.806
(Chuckles)
I will know for sure

22:49.841 --> 22:51.842
as soon as my private
investigator gets back to me.

22:51.876 --> 22:53.360
You hired a P.I. on him?

22:53.394 --> 22:55.212
Wouldn't you?

22:55.246 --> 22:56.513
Yeah.

22:56.547 --> 22:59.833
I am going to grow old alone.

23:01.919 --> 23:04.922
I'm making lists...

23:04.923 --> 23:07.491
of Fitz's favorite songs,

23:07.525 --> 23:09.542
bands he loves,

23:09.576 --> 23:10.793
poems he's quoted,

23:10.827 --> 23:13.596
Bible verses that seem to fit
his personality,

23:13.630 --> 23:14.714
hymns he likes.

23:14.765 --> 23:17.233
Sally has me
planning his funeral.

23:17.267 --> 23:19.819
Mellie's let me visit him
exactly once,

23:19.853 --> 23:22.538
then she revoked
my privileges.

23:22.573 --> 23:25.308
I may not even
get to say good-bye.

23:29.379 --> 23:31.247
I'm gonna say this once,

23:32.382 --> 23:34.433
and I better not ever
have to say it again...

23:36.002 --> 23:37.486
Don't you ever again
suggest to me

23:37.520 --> 23:40.472
that Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III
is going to die.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.508
That is unacceptable
coming from you.

23:43.559 --> 23:45.460
He calls you the love of his life.

23:45.495 --> 23:50.599
Don't you <i>dare</i> give up on him.

23:55.271 --> 23:56.455
(Whispers) Yeah.

24:01.344 --> 24:02.878
W...

24:03.912 --> 24:05.379
Do you wanna watch the news?

24:05.413 --> 24:06.380
Yes.

24:06.398 --> 24:07.348
Mm-hmm.

24:07.382 --> 24:08.566
Sure.

24:10.018 --> 24:12.954
<i>(Man speaking indistinctly)</i>

24:15.557 --> 24:18.659
You are not going
to grow old alone.

24:18.694 --> 24:19.844
You're never alone.

24:19.878 --> 24:21.395
I'm here.

24:25.817 --> 24:28.502
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

24:29.037 --> 24:30.237
It's blackmail.

24:30.255 --> 24:32.639
That Bible-thumping bitch
is blackmailing me,

24:32.674 --> 24:35.275
and I don't want to give in to her.
I won't.

24:35.310 --> 24:37.227
But I have every intention of
living long enough to resign

24:37.262 --> 24:39.696
when there's a legitimate
President in office.

24:39.731 --> 24:42.266
- Fitz is a legitimate President.
- You know what I mean.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.867
- I'm talking about...
- He's lying in a hospital room,

24:43.902 --> 24:46.369
fighting for his life, and he had
nothing to do with how he got elected.

24:46.420 --> 24:48.071
He's a patriot
and he's legitimate.

24:50.041 --> 24:52.759
We're both in hospital rooms.

24:52.794 --> 24:55.863
(Sighs)
Karma's a funny thing.

24:56.697 --> 24:58.831
We're paying the price
for what we did.

25:01.034 --> 25:03.970
Liv, is there any way
out of this with Sally?

25:04.004 --> 25:06.355
Anything I can do to keep
her from blackmailing me?

25:06.406 --> 25:08.707
You can resign.
Step down from the bench.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.876
- Liv... - It's the only way if you
want to keep your legacy intact.

25:10.894 --> 25:12.328
You spend the time you have left

25:12.362 --> 25:14.013
with your family, your grandkids.

25:14.447 --> 25:15.881
Oh, that sounds nice.

25:19.653 --> 25:21.620
I've been seeing pictures

25:21.654 --> 25:24.690
of that fellow wearing
the red hoodie all day.

25:26.293 --> 25:27.743
He looks a lot like Huck.

25:27.777 --> 25:28.844
Huh.

25:32.265 --> 25:34.917
Like I said,

25:34.951 --> 25:36.568
karma's a funny thing.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.590

25:45.812 --> 25:48.881
♪

26:07.934 --> 26:09.768
(Keys jangle and thud)

26:09.802 --> 26:12.755
♪

26:31.856 --> 26:33.673
(Sighs)

26:33.708 --> 26:35.509
I'll leave with you.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.194
Really?

26:37.228 --> 26:38.929
Yeah, we're the same.

26:38.963 --> 26:40.881
We're built the same.

26:41.415 --> 26:42.498
I love you.

26:42.533 --> 26:44.417
I love you, too.

26:45.636 --> 26:47.120
What's your real name?

26:47.171 --> 26:49.105
Does it matter?

26:53.811 --> 26:55.945
No, it doesn't.

26:59.850 --> 27:01.551
Just give me an hour
to get my stuff.

27:01.986 --> 27:04.602
- I'll meet you at our spot?
- Okay.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.716
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

27:35.686 --> 27:37.103
Just tell me.

27:37.254 --> 27:39.588
Don't sugarcoat it. How long
has it been? Is it serious?

27:39.623 --> 27:41.273
Did you take pictures?

27:41.308 --> 27:44.760
I looked into it. Your husband's
not seeing anyone on the side.

27:44.794 --> 27:46.578
(Exhales)
Oh, thank God.

27:46.613 --> 27:48.814
The number on your phone belongs
to a guy named David Rrosen.

27:48.848 --> 27:49.948
David Rosen?

27:50.016 --> 27:52.384
He's an assistant
U.S. attorney,

27:52.419 --> 27:53.802
who, by the way, is straight.

27:54.037 --> 27:56.404
Just got dumped by some redhead.
He's taking it really hard.

27:56.439 --> 27:58.640
Anyway, he's been calling James
for some kind of information,

27:58.674 --> 28:00.625
and as far as I can tell, James
hasn't given him anything.

28:00.759 --> 28:03.778
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm an artist.

28:03.813 --> 28:05.313
I'm an innovator in my field.

28:05.331 --> 28:06.981
The retainer you're
paying me is generous,

28:07.016 --> 28:08.533
but maybe don't call me up
every time your husband

28:08.567 --> 28:11.136
takes a business trip to some
tiny little town in Ohio.

28:11.587 --> 28:13.905
What town...

28:13.939 --> 28:14.972
in Ohio?

28:15.007 --> 28:16.757
Which tiny little town
did he visit?

28:16.792 --> 28:18.242
Defiance, near Toledo.

28:18.277 --> 28:21.412
And he charged it to his expense
account... work, not personal.

28:21.746 --> 28:23.013
(Exhales deeply)

28:23.048 --> 28:24.698
Keep watching him.

28:24.733 --> 28:26.467
I'll pay you
whatever you want.

28:26.501 --> 28:29.236
(Tires peal)

28:29.970 --> 28:31.638
I tracked down the woman
from the hotel elevator.

28:31.673 --> 28:32.723
That's good news.

28:32.774 --> 28:33.874
Unfortunately,
so did the FBI.

28:33.908 --> 28:35.559
They got her
and the phone he picked up.

28:35.593 --> 28:37.694
- We were too late. I'm sorry.
- So not-so-good news.

28:37.745 --> 28:39.529
(Cell phone beeps)

28:39.580 --> 28:41.331
(Rings and beeps)

28:41.366 --> 28:43.350
Huck, where are you?

28:43.384 --> 28:46.353
(Indistinct conversations)

28:50.625 --> 28:53.193
Are you insane?
Go back to the office.

28:53.227 --> 28:55.228
It's not safe for you here.
I promised I'd say good-bye.

28:55.263 --> 28:56.347
What are you talking about?

28:56.380 --> 28:57.980
I was in the hotel room.
People saw me.

28:57.981 --> 28:59.082
I don't care.
You didn't do it.

28:59.116 --> 29:00.066
Doesn't matter.
People saw me.

29:00.084 --> 29:02.719
If they want to hang me
for this, they will.

29:02.753 --> 29:05.738
What?
She got to you, didn't she?

29:05.772 --> 29:07.006
No.
She did.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.841
You found her,
and she got to you.

29:08.859 --> 29:10.760
Huck, she shot the President.

29:11.194 --> 29:12.327
Not just that,
she shot the President,

29:12.362 --> 29:13.846
and she framed <i>you</i> for it.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.130
She was doing her job.

29:15.181 --> 29:19.068
Her job? Huck, this isn't
just about you anymore.

29:19.102 --> 29:21.070
It's about a man
lying in a hospital bed

29:21.104 --> 29:23.489
because your girlfriend
shot him in the head,

29:23.523 --> 29:25.591
a woman who's clearly using
you to protect herself.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.960
And if you can't see that,
you're blind. Huck...

29:27.994 --> 29:29.645
Don't touch me.

29:30.814 --> 29:33.015
Do I tell you who to love?
No.

29:33.049 --> 29:35.234
So don't tell me.

29:37.470 --> 29:40.339
(Indistinct conversations continue)

29:41.941 --> 29:45.527
Up Independence Avenue,
swinging back on Pennsylvania.

29:46.178 --> 29:47.612
Ms. Pope.

29:48.146 --> 29:49.413
We're just discussing
possible routes

29:49.447 --> 29:50.447
for the funeral procession.

29:50.465 --> 29:51.816
We're operating
on the assumption

29:51.850 --> 29:54.235
that the body would lie in state
in the Capitol rotunda.

29:54.286 --> 29:56.387
Tradition calls for 24 hours
for public visitation.

29:56.421 --> 29:59.123
- Yes, of course. - Then there is
the question of open casket or closed.

29:59.157 --> 30:00.975
I'll take that question
to the first lady.

30:01.026 --> 30:03.144
As far as military presence
and protocol at the site,

30:03.195 --> 30:06.430
if you'll turn to page seven,

30:06.465 --> 30:09.684
you'll see we've arranged
a 21-gun salute,

30:09.718 --> 30:12.203
as well as six honor guards
to fold the casket's flag

30:12.237 --> 30:14.322
before presenting it
to the first lady.

30:14.356 --> 30:16.157
(Volume fades)
We've also confirmed

30:16.191 --> 30:18.442
a missing man aerial flyover
by the U.S. air force.

30:18.460 --> 30:21.295
(Speaking inaudibly)

30:24.983 --> 30:27.834
Have you thought about putting
the casket outdoors?

30:30.071 --> 30:32.839
He loves being outdoors.

30:59.832 --> 31:01.449
Becky's meeting me in an hour.

31:01.467 --> 31:02.934
As soon as she leaves
her apartment,

31:02.969 --> 31:05.036
wait ten minutes, then go
in, and plant the gun.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.338
Copy that.
Huck?

31:06.389 --> 31:08.456
- Yes?
- You're doing the right thing.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.875
Don't go in before
the ten minutes are up.

31:10.926 --> 31:11.877
Half the time people think

31:11.928 --> 31:14.529
they've forgotten
something and come back.

31:14.563 --> 31:16.281
(Beep)

31:19.418 --> 31:23.004
(Projector and camera

31:23.939 --> 31:26.373
(Door closes)

31:26.391 --> 31:27.075
I'm home.

31:27.093 --> 31:28.510
Cyrus?

31:32.748 --> 31:35.350
What are you...

31:36.268 --> 31:37.801
Did you cook all this?

31:37.836 --> 31:39.470
I ordered it
from a restaurant.

31:39.504 --> 31:40.804
Well,
you set the table and...

31:40.839 --> 31:43.107
Amalia set the table.
She's off today,

31:43.141 --> 31:44.825
but I made her come in
and set the table,

31:44.860 --> 31:46.260
which is... I'm a republican
overlord, I know, but...

31:46.294 --> 31:47.261
Cyrus Beene.

31:47.295 --> 31:49.647
<i>But</i> there's a reason.

31:49.681 --> 31:50.614
Mm.

31:51.265 --> 31:52.465
What did you do?

31:52.783 --> 31:55.001
A baby was born
at County General this evening

31:55.035 --> 31:56.553
at 5:42 P.M. ...

31:56.604 --> 31:58.872
A girl.
5 pounds, 11 ounces.

31:58.906 --> 32:01.007
We can bring her home
in a week, if...

32:01.041 --> 32:02.842
You say yes.

32:02.876 --> 32:04.410
- You stole a baby?
- I did not...

32:04.445 --> 32:06.012
- You <i>bought</i> a baby?
- I pulled some strings

32:06.046 --> 32:07.580
and got us
to the front of the line,

32:07.615 --> 32:10.049
which is wrong, very wrong.

32:10.084 --> 32:12.118
But like I said,
I'm a republican overlord,

32:12.152 --> 32:14.570
and your dream is a baby,
so...

32:14.604 --> 32:15.721
(Chuckles)

32:16.056 --> 32:18.741
And now you're thinking
"why now?"

32:18.775 --> 32:22.695
When I didn't want a baby
before, why now?

32:22.729 --> 32:24.196
Someone sh...

32:24.231 --> 32:25.899
Shot my best friend.

32:27.133 --> 32:31.320
He's lying in a hospital bed
dying, which makes me denying us

32:31.354 --> 32:34.056
a chance to start a family
seem ludicrous.

32:34.090 --> 32:36.341
So there's a baby girl
in county general,

32:36.376 --> 32:39.627
and if you say yes, in one week,
she could be our daughter.

32:39.678 --> 32:40.729
- We can...
- Yes.

32:40.763 --> 32:42.881
You know I'll go back to work soon.

32:42.915 --> 32:44.099
Yes. This is our baby.

32:44.150 --> 32:45.650
Which means

32:46.068 --> 32:47.969
- you'll need to stay home.
- Yes.

32:48.003 --> 32:50.538
You'll have to quit your job

32:50.572 --> 32:52.256
because one parent
should be at home.

32:52.291 --> 32:54.558
I'm not gonna stop
saying yes.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.160
Hey.

32:57.345 --> 32:58.562
Yes?

32:59.764 --> 33:01.348
Yes.

33:04.502 --> 33:06.520
Yes. Yes.

33:06.554 --> 33:08.055
Yes. (Kisses)

33:08.089 --> 33:10.791
Okay. Come here.

33:14.029 --> 33:15.112

36:23.854 --> 36:26.655
President Grant's funeral plans,
pending the first lady's approval.

36:34.296 --> 36:35.647
Hmm.

36:35.681 --> 36:37.915
Why a riderless horse during
the funeral procession?

36:37.950 --> 36:41.836
It symbolizes a warrior
who rides no more.

36:41.870 --> 36:44.255
And the boots reversed
in the stirrups?

36:44.273 --> 36:46.441
They represent a fallen leader
looking back on his troops

36:46.475 --> 36:48.192
for the last time.

36:48.226 --> 36:49.894
Nice job.

36:49.928 --> 36:51.546
Hopefully,
we won't have to use it.

36:53.331 --> 36:55.283
By the way, did the FBI
manage to get

36:55.317 --> 36:57.684
a print off that woman's cell phone?

36:57.719 --> 37:00.421
They did.
But it was only a partial,

37:00.455 --> 37:03.123
which is as good as nothing
without a suspect in custody.

37:03.158 --> 37:04.241
Anything else?

37:04.259 --> 37:06.160
No. Good night,
madam President.

37:06.194 --> 37:08.045
Good night.

37:10.314 --> 37:11.381
Olivia.

37:11.399 --> 37:12.783
So you finally got

37:12.817 --> 37:14.384
a President that'll do
your bidding.

37:14.418 --> 37:15.685
Didn't your mama ever
teach you to share?

37:15.720 --> 37:17.587
We're supposed to be in this together.
We had a deal.

37:17.621 --> 37:20.423
Am I the pot or this kettle
in this here dealio?

37:21.776 --> 37:23.526
You took down Verna.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.045
You drew first blood.
You and Verna turned on me

37:26.079 --> 37:29.048
when you conspired to save
Lindsay Dwyer behind my back.

37:29.099 --> 37:30.516
I believe everything
that comes after now,

37:30.551 --> 37:33.186
well, that's just what they
call... (Whispers) fair game.

37:35.638 --> 37:37.839
Your boy really went crazy tonight.

37:37.874 --> 37:39.958
He stopped by two baby stores.
At the first place,

37:39.992 --> 37:41.460
he made the clerk explain
how to put in a car seat.

37:41.494 --> 37:42.844
It was... thrilling.

37:42.879 --> 37:43.746
Where is he now?

37:43.780 --> 37:45.680
Probably still at the baby store.
You want me to go back?

37:47.683 --> 37:50.285
That's okay.
You can stop watching him.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.106
At least for now.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.676
The slow nipples work
for most newborns.

37:58.127 --> 37:59.744
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- A girl.

37:59.779 --> 38:01.229
- Congratulations.
-Thanks.

38:01.247 --> 38:02.964
If you have any questions,
I'll be right around the corner.

38:02.982 --> 38:04.666
Thank you.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.751
Okay. Where were we?

38:06.785 --> 38:09.103
Something about the national
election being rigged,

38:09.138 --> 38:11.022
which you say you can prove.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.124
Yes, what I can't prove is who
on the Grant team knew about it.

38:13.175 --> 38:14.375
Does your husband know
you're looking into this?

38:14.409 --> 38:15.693
He offered me a baby.

38:15.727 --> 38:16.761
He hates babies.

38:17.095 --> 38:19.279
- So he knows.
- He'll be watching you.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.498
Which is why
I need you to take this.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.949
And this is?

38:22.967 --> 38:25.819
The memory card I stole from
the voting machine in defiance.

38:25.854 --> 38:26.954
Lose it and we bungle

38:26.988 --> 38:28.488
the biggest story
since Watergate.

38:28.506 --> 38:29.890
Keep it...

38:29.924 --> 38:32.743
And we bring down an entire
administration together.

38:32.777 --> 38:33.961
I need to go.

38:33.995 --> 38:35.095
Yeah.

38:35.130 --> 38:36.547
See you.

38:37.481 --> 38:40.900
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

38:49.635 --> 38:52.937
(Keys jangle)

39:03.532 --> 39:04.899
(Keys jangle)

39:22.567 --> 39:24.735
(Sets glasses down)

39:48.960 --> 39:52.363
(Unzips zipper)

39:52.397 --> 39:53.948
(Panting)

40:12.317 --> 40:15.202
(Panting)

40:31.408 --> 40:33.459
(Door closes)

40:35.278 --> 40:36.929
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

40:38.315 --> 40:40.699
Madam President, supreme court
justice Verna Thornton

40:40.734 --> 40:42.401
is here to see you.

40:45.589 --> 40:47.907
- You're looking well.
- Yes, I am.

40:47.942 --> 40:49.875
Are you here to deliver
your letter of resignation?

40:49.909 --> 40:51.810
- I do have it, however...
- However?

40:51.845 --> 40:54.813
However, I would like to offer
you something else instead.

40:54.848 --> 40:55.898
I'm not sure there is
anything I want from you,

40:55.932 --> 40:57.616
other than your seat
on the bench, so...

40:57.650 --> 40:59.752
Not even the name of the
man in the red hoodie?

41:05.942 --> 41:08.694
I could give you my
letter of resignation

41:09.729 --> 41:11.079
or I could give you the name

41:11.113 --> 41:13.114
of the man who tried
to kill the President.

41:13.149 --> 41:14.749
The most wanted man
in the world,

41:14.784 --> 41:16.384
your Osama Bin Laden.

41:16.418 --> 41:18.019
One pill makes you larger.

41:18.037 --> 41:19.721
One pill makes you small.

41:26.311 --> 41:28.162
You need to come here.
Huck needs you.

41:28.197 --> 41:30.264
He keeps saying that
she killed his family.

41:30.299 --> 41:31.565
Do you know what that means?

41:31.583 --> 41:33.985
What family?

41:34.219 --> 41:37.588
Huck, you need to
listen to me right now.

41:37.623 --> 41:40.324
She will not get away with this.
We will find her.

41:40.359 --> 41:43.594
We will find her.

41:45.497 --> 41:48.265
I don't know why we're not
telling the FBI about Becky.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.134
Won't do any good.
She's in the wind.

41:50.185 --> 41:51.568
So? They could mobilize

41:51.603 --> 41:52.736
thousands of agents
to look for her.

41:52.770 --> 41:54.321
They could get the whole
country looking for her.

41:54.355 --> 41:55.589
It took the whole country
two years to find you,

41:55.623 --> 41:57.207
and you weren't even a superspy.

41:57.242 --> 41:58.842
Also, if they start
looking into Becky,

41:58.893 --> 41:59.977
they'll eventually find
a Huck connection.

42:00.011 --> 42:01.695
The FBI only has a partial print.

42:01.729 --> 42:03.780
As long as they can't match
it to him, he's safe.

42:03.832 --> 42:05.532
I can't watch this.

42:08.736 --> 42:10.704
(Gasps)

42:12.540 --> 42:13.757
Shh.

42:19.013 --> 42:20.781
Where is he?

42:23.317 --> 42:26.069
(Thud) (Man) Get on the floor!
Get on the floor now!

42:26.120 --> 42:27.520
(Olivia) What are you...

42:27.538 --> 42:29.489
(Man speaking indistinctly)

42:30.123 --> 42:31.390
(Man) Do not move!

42:31.425 --> 42:32.675
(Handcuffs click)

42:34.712 --> 42:36.530
What's the charge?

42:37.248 --> 42:38.982
This man is being held under
the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act.
