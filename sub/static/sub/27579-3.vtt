I'm your very own Star Girl,
Courtney Whitmore.

00:35.805 --> 00:37.940
And today, we are rocketing
across the galaxy

00:38.007 --> 00:40.844
for another Good World Studios
exclusive interview.

00:40.911 --> 00:44.714
We're hanging out
with the most transformative
young actor in Hollywood,

00:44.781 --> 00:49.051
<i>the star
</i> <i>of the hit sci-fi series,
Space Trek: 3016.</i>

00:49.118 --> 00:51.954
That's right,
it's Lieutenant Torque
himself...

00:52.021 --> 00:54.790
-Garfield Logan.
-My friends call me Gar.

00:54.857 --> 00:57.861
(LAUGHS) Well,
just between friends, Gar,

00:57.928 --> 01:01.697
I'm dying to know more
about a certain special friend
you've been seen with,

01:01.764 --> 01:04.500
Queen Perdita of Vlatava.

01:04.566 --> 01:06.369
(CHUCKLES) What can I say?

01:06.436 --> 01:09.038
She's my queen
and I'm her fool in love.

01:09.105 --> 01:11.341
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:11.407 --> 01:15.111
Tell the kids at home
about how you two love birds
became "Gardita."

01:15.178 --> 01:18.114
Um, well,
it's not a cheerful story.

01:18.181 --> 01:23.181
We... We met at a funeral
for a fast friend of ours.

01:24.187 --> 01:27.824
Oh, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

01:27.891 --> 01:30.926
But I'm sure your friend
would be happy knowing
he helped unite

01:30.993 --> 01:32.728
the hearts of his two besties.

01:32.795 --> 01:34.930
And speaking of
unifying hearts,

01:34.997 --> 01:36.633
you've recently begun
a campaign

01:36.700 --> 01:40.435
to unify the world
in vigilance against
a growing threat.

01:40.502 --> 01:42.104
Totally, Courtney.

01:42.171 --> 01:45.007
As one of the very few openly
meta-civilians in the world,

01:45.074 --> 01:47.878
I wanna raise awareness
about meta-human trafficking.

01:47.944 --> 01:51.747
Kids our age are being
targeted and kidnapped
into an underground market

01:51.814 --> 01:53.550
for meta-experimentation.

01:53.616 --> 01:57.554
So, in solidarity,
we all have to rise up
and fight back.

01:57.620 --> 02:01.090
Remember,
if you see something,
scream something.

02:01.157 --> 02:06.157

I have just spoken
with His Highness,

for the parting and tarring
of a Prince of the Realm!

"His Highness"? Gregor?

05:35.037 --> 05:36.872

05:36.939 --> 05:38.374
You lied to me!

You said this was all done

05:41.011 --> 05:45.247

His so-called "Highness"

I will deliver control
of Markovia to him.

I only required this
organization to operate

07:04.961 --> 07:09.732
So I might play the role
of Regent to the King,
without interruption.

07:09.799 --> 07:13.569
But it seems
that was too much to ask.
