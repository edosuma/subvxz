00:32.333 --> 00:35.624
Anyway, to cut a long story short,

00:35.625 --> 00:37.943
I decided to kill myself.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.999
That's the trouble with
suicides, I've learnt.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.082
You can't cut the long story short,

00:44.083 --> 00:48.060
because it's the long story
that people are interested in.

00:48.292 --> 00:49.749
Especially if you're me,

00:49.750 --> 00:52.499
which, regrettably, I was

00:52.500 --> 00:54.874
and still am to this day.

00:54.875 --> 00:59.957
So, forgive me if you already
knew this, but I'm Martin Sharp,

00:59.958 --> 01:01.624
the man who had everything.

01:01.625 --> 01:06.124
One wife, two children, three dogs,
at least four People's Choice awards,

01:06.125 --> 01:10.860
and five mornings a week on the most
successful breakfast show in Britain.

01:11.333 --> 01:14.647
Huh, they were even
offering me Mondays off.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.273
So far, so good.

01:17.292 --> 01:21.980
I had reached middle age
unscathed, with money in the bank.

01:22.875 --> 01:28.249
Until I met Susie Jenkins at a
launch for a new men's moisturiser.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.957
- Happy New Year, mate.
- All I can say in my defence, Your Honour,

01:30.958 --> 01:33.644
is that she looked 25 to me.

01:33.833 --> 01:35.559
But she wasn't.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.624
Cue, in chronological order,

01:38.625 --> 01:42.291
tabloid frenzy, a short
prison sentence, divorce,

01:42.292 --> 01:45.605
disgrace, demolition.

01:45.833 --> 01:48.318
Doors closing.

01:48.458 --> 01:51.707
New Year's Eve is supposed
to be a pause for breath,

01:51.708 --> 01:53.707
a punctuation mark.

01:53.708 --> 01:56.499
Well, I had come to a full stop.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.707
Really.

01:57.708 --> 02:01.520
Why wouldn't I want to throw myself
off the top of a tall building?

03:22.875 --> 03:25.311
Oh! Oh!

03:43.958 --> 03:45.815
Excuse me.

03:46.042 --> 03:47.980
Excuse me.

03:50.042 --> 03:51.416
Hi.

03:51.417 --> 03:55.394
Um, I'm not entirely sure
how to phrase this, but...

03:56.500 --> 03:58.356
Are you going to be long?

03:58.708 --> 04:02.354
- What?
- I wasn't sure whether to wait my turn, or...

04:02.708 --> 04:06.401
I hadn't considered the wire. I'd
really like to borrow your ladder.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.541
Maybe I should just
wait. I'll wait.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.874
Are you just going to
stand there and watch?

04:10.875 --> 04:15.149
No. No, of course. You'll be wanting
to do it on your own, I'd imagine.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.124
You imagine right.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.666
I'll go there.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.226
All right.

04:24.542 --> 04:27.026
I'll give you a
shout on the way down.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.226
Right.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.684
Oh, jeez!

04:52.417 --> 04:53.976
I can't.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.356
Maybe you should go first.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.069
I would want to be on my own.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.734
- Completely.
- Understood.

05:02.458 --> 05:05.902
Twenty minutes, then
I want my spot back.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.182
- Right.
- OK.

05:15.958 --> 05:17.945
- Ooh!
- Oh!

05:32.250 --> 05:33.976
Maureen.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.774
Martin.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.101
Are you from...

05:40.333 --> 05:44.499
- Oh, I... I recognise your face.
- Oh, do you?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.749
Were you married to
someone in a pop group?

05:46.750 --> 05:48.309
No.

05:48.958 --> 05:52.541
- Were you on TV?
- Maureen, perhaps this is not

05:52.542 --> 05:54.610
the best time to talk about this.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.332
- Out of my way, fuckers!
- No, stop, stop!

06:05.333 --> 06:06.541
No! No!

06:06.542 --> 06:09.357
- Maureen, a bit of help?
- Who the fuck are you?

06:09.417 --> 06:11.666
- What do you want me to do?
- Sit on her legs.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.731
You're getting a thrill out of
this, aren't you, you pervert?

06:15.750 --> 06:17.374
- Oh, my God.
- What?

06:17.375 --> 06:20.624
You're Martin Sharp. You
are a pervert, officially!

06:20.625 --> 06:24.416
That's it! Rise and Shine
with Martin and Penny!

06:24.417 --> 06:26.983
Just let me go...

06:29.917 --> 06:32.318
- No, just...
- Wait!

06:37.708 --> 06:39.316
Hi.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.684
Erm...

06:42.917 --> 06:46.230
Any of you guys order a pizza?

06:48.792 --> 06:51.442
Well, shall we do introductions?

06:53.208 --> 06:55.017
I'm Jess.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.521
Everyone calls me Jess.

06:58.792 --> 07:01.193
I... I'm Maureen.

07:01.667 --> 07:04.082
- I'm, uh... I'm JJ.
- I'm...

07:04.083 --> 07:05.457
- Martin Sharp.
- Yes.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.606
It's very exciting to have a
celebrity in our suicidal midst.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.624
- This feels wrong.
- Mmm.

07:10.625 --> 07:13.607
All right, well, we could just
do a "one, two, three, jump!"

07:17.625 --> 07:19.647
Whoa!

07:23.917 --> 07:27.124
I wouldn't have minded if it had
been the proverbial cry for help,

07:27.125 --> 07:30.832
but, believe me, you don't cart
a ladder up 15 flights of stairs

07:30.833 --> 07:34.791
on a freezing cold New Year's
Eve unless you're serious.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.351
Nice to meet you.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.650
It was just another
debacle. Another cock-up.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.457
I'd have believed you if you'd
told me half an hour before

07:44.458 --> 07:46.832
that I'd end up on my car,

07:46.833 --> 07:48.606
but not in it.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.582
And I absolutely knew, with
every fibre of my being,

07:58.583 --> 08:02.194
that I wouldn't be seeing any of
those freaks and misfits again.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.707
I didn't know what they
were doing up there.

08:04.708 --> 08:07.477
And I didn't want to find
out, thank you very much.

08:07.708 --> 08:09.814
I had no interest whatsoever.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.273
Oh, fuck.

08:16.417 --> 08:18.624
Do I regret stopping
to pick her up?

08:18.625 --> 08:22.069
Well, that really is along story.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.207
- Want a lift?
- No, no.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.735
The bus will be
along in 15 minutes.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.855
Get in the car, Maureen.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.308
Oh!

08:46.292 --> 08:48.563
I did like your television show.

09:19.917 --> 09:23.666
- What are you doing?
- Aw, it's a bit early for a reunion, isn't it?

09:23.667 --> 09:26.400
Get in the car.
We're taking you home.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.939
So this is...

09:40.542 --> 09:42.149
Jolly.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.398
OK.

09:44.958 --> 09:46.166
One word answers.

09:46.167 --> 09:47.749
Everyone has one word to explain

09:47.750 --> 09:49.457
why they were up on the
roof in the first place.

09:49.458 --> 09:53.435
For example, Martin might say

09:53.458 --> 09:55.541
- notoriety.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:55.542 --> 09:58.736
- Maureen might say loneliness.
- I'm not lonely.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.874
- Tell that to your cats.
- I don't have cats.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.063
I was up there because I felt...

10:04.958 --> 10:06.666
- Helpless.
- Helpless?

10:06.667 --> 10:07.916
That's a very good adjective.

10:07.917 --> 10:11.291
Are we not fitting into your
pre-ordained boxes, Jess?

10:11.292 --> 10:14.457
Actually, you fill your
one marvellously, Martin.

10:14.458 --> 10:16.480
Was prison fun?

10:16.917 --> 10:20.360
You really believe you have an
answer for everything, don't you?

10:20.750 --> 10:24.332
I really believe that you
are a miserable bastard.

10:24.333 --> 10:28.124
Actually, right now, a miserable
bastard is exactly what I am.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.981
Have I not been hiding it well?

10:30.375 --> 10:32.332
- Pizza boy.
- JJ.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.624
Why might pizza boy want to die?

10:34.625 --> 10:37.541
What would be your reason, Jess?

10:37.542 --> 10:40.624
My reason would be love.

10:40.625 --> 10:44.082
Chas. Chas the dickhead.
He spurned me.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.986
I'm a spurned woman.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.149
Cancer.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.731
I was up there
because I have cancer.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.249
I have inoperable cancer.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.332
We have a winner.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.916
That's fucking brilliant.

10:58.917 --> 11:02.041
Very impressed. Is it
an embarrassing cancer?

11:02.042 --> 11:03.649
Brain.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.023
CCR.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.707
- I'm sorry, JJ.
- Yeah.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.944
I think colon would
have been better.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.807
Ooh, we're here.

11:17.875 --> 11:21.603
What, here? You live here?

11:21.792 --> 11:24.624
No, but Chas is likely to be here

11:24.625 --> 11:27.986
and I've got a couple of
things I want to say to him.

11:29.958 --> 11:32.457
Good luck with your next
attempt. See you in the afterlife.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.066
Yep, good night.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.235
Unhappy little thing, isn't she?

11:53.083 --> 11:54.986
I should have known.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.999
The most popular place
in London for suicides

11:58.000 --> 12:00.416
on the most popular
night for suicides.

12:00.417 --> 12:01.999
I should have known.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.332
- I wouldn't be alone.
- I don't know why she thought I have cats.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.647
And she certainly
swears too much, but...

12:11.542 --> 12:13.707
Go on, Maureen, just say it.

12:13.708 --> 12:16.145
I just, um...

12:17.667 --> 12:19.605
Should she be alone?

12:35.292 --> 12:36.499
Right.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.624
Uh, Martin, you,
uh, you go that way.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.541
- I'll go... I'll go this way.
- No, no, no. I can't do this...

12:41.542 --> 12:44.416
What else are we gonna do?
Hey, what else are we gonna do?

12:44.417 --> 12:46.041
And, Maureen, uh...

12:46.042 --> 12:48.124
You take... You take the bathrooms.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.894
The bathrooms. Bathrooms? OK, go.

12:57.542 --> 13:00.559
I'm looking for a
girl called Jess. Jess?

13:07.417 --> 13:11.193
I'm looking... I'm looking
for a girl called Jess. Jess?

13:35.875 --> 13:40.480
- Hi. I'm looking for a...
- Hi.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.320
- I'm looking for a...
- Hi.

13:43.625 --> 13:47.436
I'm looking for a girl... Jess.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.249
Good.

13:57.250 --> 14:00.315
Great. Perfect.

14:02.625 --> 14:05.416
17, 16,

14:05.417 --> 14:08.332
15,14.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.249
13,12.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.707
11,10.

14:13.708 --> 14:15.916
Nine, eight,

14:15.917 --> 14:18.166
seven, six,

14:18.167 --> 14:20.249
five, four,

14:20.250 --> 14:23.207
three, two, one!

14:23.208 --> 14:25.942
Happy New Year!

14:55.083 --> 14:58.101
- Hi.
- Uh...

14:58.292 --> 15:01.060
- You hiding, too, are you?
- Yeah.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.124
I've... I've taken some pills.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.064
It's all good.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.566
- What are you hiding from?
- Oh, you know...

15:09.208 --> 15:12.207
Humans. Humanity, life. You?

15:12.208 --> 15:13.874
The nutter who's trying to kill me.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.874
Your reason's better
than mine, then.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.291
And where is this nutter?

15:18.292 --> 15:20.397
- She's everywhere.
- Oh.

15:20.833 --> 15:25.207
- Godlike, is she?
- I was just hoping I was having a bad pill.

15:25.208 --> 15:30.082
Um, but she... She's not supposed to be
here and I'm pretty sure I've just seen her.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.957
I'm pretty sure I've seen
you on breakfast TV.

15:32.958 --> 15:36.457
So... Maybe I'm actually
having a good pill and...

15:36.458 --> 15:38.124
You're Chas, aren't you?

15:38.125 --> 15:42.082
- How do you know that?
- I'm here with the... nutter.

15:42.083 --> 15:46.249
Chas! Chas, Chas, Chas!
Wait. Listen to me. Listen.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.749
Let's just go and
find her together, eh?

15:48.750 --> 15:50.041
I mean, what's the
worst that can happen?

15:50.042 --> 15:53.707
Eh, she tried to kill me twice,
got me... Got me arrested once.

15:53.708 --> 15:57.874
Mmm, I'm banned from three pubs,
two clubs and... And a cinema.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.166
- OK.
- Just let me leave quietly.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.166
- All right. OK.
- I've done nothing wrong.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.374
Nothing wrong?

16:04.375 --> 16:07.653
Taking her to bed! Nothing wrong?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.332
Where is she? Where's
Jess? We need to find her.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.541
- You need to talk to her.
- She won't talk.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.457
She'll just chase me
with a bread knife.

16:14.458 --> 16:17.666
Oh, tonight she was prepared to end
her life because of what you did to her.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.124
- Maureen, don't.
- What?

16:19.125 --> 16:22.166
Yeah, that's where we met her,
at the top of a tower block.

16:22.167 --> 16:23.999
- Preparing to...
- What?

16:24.000 --> 16:27.895
Hey! Hey, it's Jess. Come on.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.666
- How's she doing?
- Ready?

16:30.667 --> 16:32.666
- Hey, Jess.
- Do you know what she took?

16:32.667 --> 16:34.916
I don't know. Drugs,
alcohol. You know, the usual.

16:34.917 --> 16:37.916
- Are you her father? Next of kin?
- No, I'm not. No, no, no, I'm not.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.999
- I need to know her name.
- I only, uh... She's called Jess.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.374
- Sir, I need her full name.
- None of us knew her before tonight.

16:44.375 --> 16:46.314
You need to wait here.

16:47.083 --> 16:50.978
- She's got no identification on her, no nothing.
- Yeah, well,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.374
she probably didn't want
to make identification easy.

16:53.375 --> 16:56.041
She likes things,
you know, difficult.

16:56.042 --> 16:59.320
Hmm, hospitals... Not a fan.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.731
Good drugs, though.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.059
Mmm!

17:50.417 --> 17:52.124
You late for something?

17:52.125 --> 17:53.749
I just

17:53.750 --> 17:57.082
need to make sure I'm home
to make Matty some breakfast.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.354
- Matty?
- My son.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.984
- You have a son?
- Yes.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.724
His breakfast is quite complicated.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.058
I don't, er...

18:11.375 --> 18:15.945
Look, if I... If I'm not going to
die tonight, it's important that he...

18:15.958 --> 18:19.355
He doesn't know
anything that happened...

18:19.583 --> 18:21.522
Here she comes.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.860
Oh, boy.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.107
Uh...

18:30.417 --> 18:31.976
OK.

18:32.250 --> 18:35.611
I've just got a few
things to clarify.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.357
Uh, number one,

18:37.708 --> 18:40.874
my gown's open-backed, 'cos
they've stolen my clothes,

18:40.875 --> 18:43.832
so I'm just gonna do a twirl for you right
now and you can have a look at my arse.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.832
Just once. It's
not my best feature,

18:45.833 --> 18:49.749
but that's something that you'll probably
find out the more we get to know one another.

18:49.750 --> 18:53.707
Uh, number two, it... It really...

18:53.708 --> 18:56.332
It wasn't an overdose,
it was just an accident.

18:56.333 --> 18:59.374
- Jess...
- Honestly. I just... I took all these pills

18:59.375 --> 19:03.041
and then... And then I took some more.
But it was... It was just for fun.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.207
I'd never kill myself
by taking pills.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.707
I'd probably do
something really cool,

19:07.708 --> 19:10.986
like jumping off the
top of a tower block.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.439
Jess, we were worried.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.541
Was I on number three? Erm...

19:15.542 --> 19:18.939
I think I was on number
four. I just wanted to say,

19:19.208 --> 19:21.416
thank you so much for caring,

19:21.417 --> 19:24.374
because I really, um... I
really, really appreciate it.

19:24.375 --> 19:28.151
He was worried. I was trying to work
out what we were still doing here.

19:30.333 --> 19:34.416
Number five. I think I was on
number f... something... six...

19:34.417 --> 19:35.541
Fuck.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.832
Is... is it just me?
Because it's...

19:37.833 --> 19:41.858
It's really fucking
cold out here, guys.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.832
It's really cold.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.483
Come here. Come here now.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.524
- Come on in. Come on.
- Yes. Hmm?

20:07.333 --> 20:09.059
Thanks.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.851
Psst.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.809
Hmm.

20:15.042 --> 20:18.791
When is the next date after New Year's
Eve when everybody kills themselves?

20:18.792 --> 20:21.276
- Why?
- Valentine's Day.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.727
That's six weeks away.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.499
OK, here's the deal.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.269
Nobody kills themselves until then.

20:31.417 --> 20:32.791
Why?

20:32.792 --> 20:34.249
I mean, why would
we want to do that?

20:34.250 --> 20:38.124
Why would we not want to kill ourselves
if and when and how we want, eh?

20:38.125 --> 20:39.832
Come on, what's the alternative?

20:39.833 --> 20:42.957
It's some sort of
race to the finish.

20:42.958 --> 20:46.957
It's me checking the
obituaries every week

20:46.958 --> 20:49.666
to see if Martin Sharp is dead.

20:49.667 --> 20:53.582
No of fence, guys, but I
don't think your deaths would

20:53.583 --> 20:55.652
really make the papers.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.358
Come on, it's six weeks.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.832
It's not such a ridiculous idea.

21:00.833 --> 21:03.483
Yes, Maureen. Has
anybody got a pen?

21:03.708 --> 21:06.726
- Can I have some paper as well?
- Paper.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.332
Great. Thanks.

21:09.333 --> 21:13.903
"The undersigned do hereby promise

21:14.125 --> 21:17.143
"not to kill themselves

21:17.583 --> 21:20.499
"before Valentine's Day."

21:20.500 --> 21:23.482
Maureen, sign just
wherever you like.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.434
Pizza boy.

21:30.958 --> 21:34.106
- But it's...
- You're dying anyway, hmm?

21:44.583 --> 21:46.735
Martin Sharp.

21:47.458 --> 21:49.267
Life-saver.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.558
Superman.

21:53.708 --> 21:55.624
Six weeks, Martin.

21:55.625 --> 22:00.314
We'll all push you off the top
ourselves if it makes any difference.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.082
It could be a little
Valentine's Day treat.

22:03.083 --> 22:06.278
I'm pretty sure we're all
going to live to regret this.

22:11.833 --> 22:14.400
Guys, look.

22:17.792 --> 22:20.276
So, this is a new year, then.

22:22.042 --> 22:24.893
Yeah.

22:28.625 --> 22:31.374
Hang on. Maureen, just
a fucking question here.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.124
Have we just written our
pact on the back of your

22:33.125 --> 22:35.147
- suicide note?
- Oh...

22:35.667 --> 22:37.653
Yes, there is that.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.791
My mum always likes to repeat
this story of me as a kid

23:08.792 --> 23:11.374
being asked what I wanted
to be when I grew up.

23:11.375 --> 23:14.653
I always used to say, "Invisible."

23:14.833 --> 23:18.894
I don't know quite what prompted it,
but the thought of it stuck with me.

23:19.208 --> 23:20.416
It was only later...

23:20.417 --> 23:25.105
that I found out that invisibility
is, in fact, a technical possibility.

23:25.833 --> 23:28.624
It was in this book that my
sister stole from the library

23:28.625 --> 23:30.874
and I stole from my sister.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.999
I followed her into crime.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.957
Though she was
better at it than me.

23:34.958 --> 23:37.041
She always sort of glowed innocence

23:37.042 --> 23:42.291
whereas I, to this day,
just sort of radiate guilt.

23:42.292 --> 23:44.332
Anyway, to be invisible is easy.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.932
You just have to find
a way to diffract light.

23:48.208 --> 23:50.894
Whoa! You trying to
get yourself killed?

23:51.792 --> 23:55.484
I haven't managed it yet,
but I'm working on it.

23:55.708 --> 23:57.332
I didn't just follow him.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.041
I followed all of them.

23:59.042 --> 24:00.832
And it wasn't stalking.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.832
You stalk a deer
in order to kill it,

24:02.833 --> 24:05.999
mount it, stick it on your wall and
tell the story of how fucking brilliant

24:06.000 --> 24:07.541
you are with a shotgun.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.374
I didn't want to kill any of them.

24:09.375 --> 24:12.582
I certainly didn't have any
interest in mounting them.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.666
And I don't own a shotgun,

24:14.667 --> 24:16.291
though I'd like one.

24:16.292 --> 24:19.457
I just wanted to
check in, invisibly,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.332
to check they were
sticking to the pact.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.832
That's not stalking.

24:22.833 --> 24:25.898
It's barely even espionage.

24:26.417 --> 24:28.024
OK.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.319
Now I know why you're ringing.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.943
Pink flamingos fly
north on Tuesday.

24:39.583 --> 24:40.707
Hello, Jess.

24:40.708 --> 24:42.416
This is a top spy location, Dad.

24:42.417 --> 24:44.771
It's hugely inconspicuous.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.268
Look, um...

24:47.292 --> 24:48.934
Where have you...?

24:49.583 --> 24:51.082
This is a situation.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.666
I've invited...

24:52.667 --> 24:55.041
A situation is what
you're referring to it as?

24:55.042 --> 24:56.457
How else would you refer to it?

24:56.458 --> 24:58.018
I don't know, Dad.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.207
Well, you did what you did.

25:02.208 --> 25:04.082
Yeah, I tried to kill myself.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.374
Jess, please don't
put words in my mouth.

25:06.375 --> 25:07.499
This is hard enough.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.707
- Is it, Dad?
- Yes.

25:08.708 --> 25:11.124
Why are we doing this here? Why
can't we just do this at home?

25:11.125 --> 25:14.207
Because the press will be there
and I'm trying to protect you.

25:14.208 --> 25:18.332
Oh, yeah. Well, you've always been
really great at that, haven't you?

25:18.333 --> 25:21.207
- Jess...
- What the hell are you doing here?

25:21.208 --> 25:22.416
Uh...

25:22.417 --> 25:24.707
- I was invited.
- You were invited?

25:24.708 --> 25:27.166
Politician's daughter.
I was surprised.

25:27.167 --> 25:28.749
I called his agent. I
thought we should all talk.

25:28.750 --> 25:29.999
- You called his agent?
- Yeah.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.624
He was delighted.

25:31.625 --> 25:34.061
First call he'd had in awhile.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.166
Was it you... Who
went to the press?

25:37.167 --> 25:38.457
No!

25:38.458 --> 25:40.624
I've been trying to figure
it out myself, but...

25:40.625 --> 25:41.916
JJ?

25:41.917 --> 25:43.541
He's too shy.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.249
It's not Maureen.

25:45.250 --> 25:46.976
No, no.

25:47.333 --> 25:49.791
Hey, it was fucking Chas.

25:49.792 --> 25:51.416
Chas sold us.

25:51.417 --> 25:55.166
My ex-wife rang this morning,
wanting to know what I'd done.

25:55.167 --> 25:56.957
Asking me what she
should tell the children.

25:56.958 --> 25:58.124
Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill him.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.624
She told me I seem to be the
only person in the whole world

26:00.625 --> 26:02.332
that the press gets bang-on.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.624
If they say I've slept with a
15-year-old, I generally have.

26:05.625 --> 26:08.791
If they say I've contemplated
suicide, I generally have.

26:08.792 --> 26:12.105
Yes, I read about
you with the girl.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.374
You haven't... You two haven't...

26:16.375 --> 26:18.291
- You're asking whether we've slept together?
- Jesus, really?

26:18.292 --> 26:21.207
- You think I'd...
- Oh, Martin! At least I'm legal.

26:21.208 --> 26:24.416
Yeah, and I value our friendship
too much to complicate it.

26:24.417 --> 26:28.666
Do you plan to maintain
your relationship with Jess?

26:28.667 --> 26:31.041
Yeah, of course he
will. We're in a gang.

26:31.042 --> 26:32.874
- We're not in a gang.
- Yeah, you signed a pact.

26:32.875 --> 26:35.707
Ah, yes, of course, the
pact. How could I forget?

26:35.708 --> 26:38.643
Yeah, Jess and I are
friends for life now.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.624
Now, look, Martin,

26:41.625 --> 26:44.666
I'm sure I don't have to tell
someone with your media training

26:44.667 --> 26:46.393
that what we...

26:46.500 --> 26:49.874
What we have here is...
Is a media firestorm.

26:49.875 --> 26:54.832
Yes, gentlemen, this
is a media firestorm.

26:54.833 --> 26:57.041
- I'll leave you to it.
- Jess. Jess!

26:57.042 --> 26:58.874
Why don't you invite him
to our family therapy?

26:58.875 --> 27:02.666
You could do that. Why don't
you pay him to be you, Dad?

27:02.667 --> 27:05.352
Martin doesn't want my money.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.357
You don't, do you?

27:09.667 --> 27:12.518
Has anyone ever told you
you're a bit of an idiot?

27:13.042 --> 27:16.604
I'm a politician. That's
all they ever tell me.

27:19.250 --> 27:20.832
- All right.
- Yep.

27:20.833 --> 27:23.082
Yep. Good luck.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.691
Yep.

27:40.583 --> 27:43.582
This is the second tragedy
for the Crichton family

27:43.583 --> 27:47.791
after the disappearance of older
sister, Jennifer two years ago.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.707
Jennifer was never found,
and you have to wonder

27:50.708 --> 27:54.124
how Shadow Education Secretary
Chris Crichton will cope

27:54.125 --> 27:56.692
with this new strain upon him.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.684
- Come on, then.
- Well done, boys.

28:01.542 --> 28:03.249
♪ Tragedy

28:03.250 --> 28:06.729
♪ When the feeling's wrong
and you can't go on. It's tragedy

28:07.458 --> 28:11.249
♪ When the morning cries and you
don't know why. It's hard to bear

28:11.250 --> 28:15.820
♪ With no one to love
you you're going nowhere

28:18.125 --> 28:19.541
♪ Tragedy ♪

28:19.542 --> 28:21.184
Jess?

28:22.875 --> 28:24.648
Can I come in?

28:26.750 --> 28:28.606
Shall I come in, Jess?

28:39.167 --> 28:41.153
Where have you gone now?

28:47.958 --> 28:49.601
Jess?

30:15.292 --> 30:16.899
Hiya.

30:22.167 --> 30:23.774
Wow!

30:24.208 --> 30:26.017
This... This is Matty.

30:26.958 --> 30:29.478
- My son.
- No, I mean... I mean...

30:29.667 --> 30:32.166
Wow! You've just...
You've completely wowed me.

30:32.167 --> 30:34.582
- Jess.
- What does that mean, 'wow'?

30:34.583 --> 30:37.041
Like, wow, this is what
you've been hiding in here.

30:37.042 --> 30:39.443
- Jess, enough.
- Sorry.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.749
Sorry.

30:41.750 --> 30:44.166
I wasn't leaving him that night.

30:44.167 --> 30:45.332
There was...

30:45.333 --> 30:47.624
Maureen, no one's
accusing you of anything.

30:47.625 --> 30:50.499
Social services would have been
forced to pay for proper care.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.774
I mean, the standard of care
they can provide, it's better.

30:55.542 --> 30:57.207
And I don't hide him.

30:57.208 --> 30:59.314
I've never hidden him, never.

30:59.542 --> 31:02.207
Can we get back to the
matter in hand, hmm?

31:02.208 --> 31:05.499
Yeah, we're all here to
figure out how to get them to

31:05.500 --> 31:07.249
leave us all alone.

31:07.250 --> 31:10.916
OK, I had three of
them call my cell today.

31:10.917 --> 31:12.541
How'd they even get my number?

31:12.542 --> 31:15.166
Yeah, how did Chas
even remember you?

31:15.167 --> 31:17.374
Hey, wait. Is Chas behind this?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.874
Yeah, I mean, you're quite cute

31:18.875 --> 31:20.582
but you're infinitely forgettable.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.226
They won't...

31:22.833 --> 31:24.374
Leave us alone.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.499
They'll find out where you
live, where Maureen lives.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.541
- What, they'll be here?
- So, I've been...

31:28.542 --> 31:30.445
I've been thinking.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.666
What if we shift the goal posts?

31:33.667 --> 31:36.082
- Goal posts?
- Yeah, make it our story, not theirs.

31:36.083 --> 31:39.832
I mean, there's even the possibility
that we might be able to make some

31:39.833 --> 31:41.249
money out of it.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.624
- Money?
- Yeah, money.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.166
That would be good
for Matty, wouldn't it?

31:44.167 --> 31:46.791
I'm sure JJ would like
a break from pizzas.

31:46.792 --> 31:48.916
And as an unemployed,
disgraced talk show host,

31:48.917 --> 31:50.207
I could certainly do with it.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.249
I don't... I don't want
Matty in the papers.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.568
We... We can't stop that.

31:55.500 --> 32:00.582
But, at least, this way
we won't lose out entirely.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.457
By telling our story...

32:02.458 --> 32:04.527
What... What story?

32:04.542 --> 32:07.291
That we went up, then
we came back down again.

32:07.292 --> 32:10.041
They've sold newspapers
off our backs.

32:10.042 --> 32:13.439
- Isn't it time we got something out of it?
- I...

32:16.208 --> 32:19.666
- Yes, OK.
- Good. Great.

32:19.667 --> 32:21.356
Yeah?

32:21.500 --> 32:24.082
- Well?
- Yeah, I mean, if you think it's...

32:24.083 --> 32:26.249
If you think it's right,
Martin, yeah, I'm in.

32:26.250 --> 32:27.791
I mean, I'm fine financially,

32:27.792 --> 32:29.999
'cos, you know, I've
got my dad to nick from.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.607
Oh.

32:31.667 --> 32:37.232
But if we were to make
the story a fun one...

32:53.625 --> 32:55.207
Let me tell you a story.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.314
We were up there...

32:58.000 --> 33:01.041
And we were ready to go

33:01.042 --> 33:04.936
and we felt this... presence.

33:05.208 --> 33:07.360
I would describe it...

33:08.917 --> 33:10.249
As a light.

33:10.250 --> 33:13.374
An ethereal glowing.

33:13.375 --> 33:15.018
It was an angel.

33:15.958 --> 33:17.916
We were visited by an angel.

33:17.917 --> 33:20.567
And it looked like...
Like Matt Damon.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.374
Matt Damon.

33:22.375 --> 33:26.649
Oh, fuck it, yeah.
I'm... I'm with her.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.416
- He looked like Matt Damon.
- Who's Matt Damon?

33:29.417 --> 33:33.582
No, no, it wasn't really a
physical angel. It was more of a...

33:33.583 --> 33:35.541
Is that what Jess told
you? What else did she say?

33:35.542 --> 33:38.457
And he was naked and he said,

33:38.458 --> 33:41.749
he literally decreed, "Thou
shalt not die tonight."

33:41.750 --> 33:43.749
I mean, this is Matt
Damon, the naked angel.

33:43.750 --> 33:46.791
- What?
- Maybe we shouldn't write all of this down.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.749
Can I talk to your editor?
Used to be a good mate of mine.

33:49.750 --> 33:51.736
Oh, an actor.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.457
What films has he been in?

33:53.458 --> 33:55.624
You're not actually
gonna print this, are you?

33:55.625 --> 33:58.607
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's how it went.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.318
I had an interesting
thing happen today.

34:05.625 --> 34:08.275
- Did you?
- Let me guess.

34:08.292 --> 34:12.731
Your second daughter humiliated you
on the pages of the national press?

34:14.708 --> 34:17.623
Actually, no. I was
in the Members' Bar...

34:17.625 --> 34:19.123
And somebody came up
to you and they said,

34:19.125 --> 34:24.891
"Chris, was that your daughter on
the pages of the national press?"

34:25.542 --> 34:28.206
People have laughed
at me for a long time,

34:28.208 --> 34:32.980
but I did prefer it when
they didn't laugh at you.

34:35.583 --> 34:37.485
An angel.

34:37.750 --> 34:41.041
You told them you saw an angel.

34:41.042 --> 34:43.623
- Chris.
- And did it look like Jennifer?

34:43.625 --> 34:45.694
Is that what you were going to say?

34:48.083 --> 34:49.643
No.

34:52.375 --> 34:54.728
No, Dad, I...

34:54.917 --> 34:57.483
I didn't tell them it
looked like Jennifer.

35:02.583 --> 35:05.482
I told them that it
looked like Matt Damon.

35:07.125 --> 35:08.749
Zoom in on camera two.

35:08.750 --> 35:12.277
Penny, you're on
in three, two, one.

35:12.625 --> 35:17.041
Many of us have been transfixed by
the story of the Topper House Four

35:17.042 --> 35:19.582
and the angel that visited them.

35:19.583 --> 35:22.124
And we are so lucky here
on Rise and Shine with Penny

35:22.125 --> 35:24.124
to have them with us
in the studio today.

35:24.125 --> 35:26.707
One of them certainly needs
no introduction. Martin.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.957
Martin Sharp, my old co-host.

35:28.958 --> 35:32.207
Penny, it's an honour to be back
on this old sofa again with you.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.207
And I'd really like to
take this opportunity

35:34.208 --> 35:37.666
to correct a few misconceptions
about this so-called angel...

35:37.667 --> 35:39.957
And we will absolutely
have time for that, Martin,

35:39.958 --> 35:42.457
but it would be remiss of
me not to begin the interview

35:42.458 --> 35:44.416
with a bit of background
on what's been happening

35:44.417 --> 35:46.485
to you in the last 12 months.

35:48.833 --> 35:50.416
Yes, well, um...

35:50.417 --> 35:53.957
Yes, well, Penny, currently I'm
juggling various job opportunities,

35:53.958 --> 35:56.276
concentrating on being a father.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.832
And, before that, I was in prison.

35:58.833 --> 36:01.291
But what we'd actually
like to talk to you about

36:01.292 --> 36:03.499
is what we allegedly
saw on the roof.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.124
And, of course, the reason
that you were in prison

36:06.125 --> 36:09.604
was for an inappropriate
relationship with an underage girl.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.916
- That's right, Penny.
- And this incident,

36:13.917 --> 36:16.499
this sex of fence, led you
to lose your job, your home,

36:16.500 --> 36:20.975
your family and finally drove
you to suicidal feelings.

36:21.042 --> 36:22.207
That's right, Penny.

36:22.208 --> 36:25.191
Which is, of course, where...

36:25.542 --> 36:27.416
Where he met you lovely people.

36:27.417 --> 36:30.082
Yeah. Yeah, we, er...
We all met up there.

36:30.083 --> 36:33.291
And where you saw your angel
that looked like Matt Damon.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.582
- Tell me more.
- Hi. Sorry.

36:35.583 --> 36:39.041
It wasn't an angel. It
was... It was more of a light.

36:39.042 --> 36:40.749
We never agreed on an angel.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.207
Now, Jess.

36:42.208 --> 36:44.832
I really... Talk to the other
people before you come to me.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.541
We know you mostly
through your father,

36:46.542 --> 36:48.707
Shadow Education
Secretary, Chris Crichton.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.707
You should probably
talk to JJ because he...

36:50.708 --> 36:52.624
He is really interesting.

36:52.625 --> 36:54.666
I'm sure he is.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.666
I'm sure you're all fascinating.

36:56.667 --> 36:59.416
But, Jess, our sympathies
lie particularly with you

36:59.417 --> 37:02.860
because of the devastating
disappearance of your sister, Jennifer.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.832
You should talk to Maureen.

37:05.833 --> 37:08.851
Um... Her son lives in a cage.

37:09.208 --> 37:11.396
But, Jess, let's focus on you.

37:12.167 --> 37:13.856
It's OK.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.691
Were you close?

37:17.333 --> 37:18.941
Penny.

37:19.208 --> 37:21.249
Why don't you ask
someone else a question?

37:21.250 --> 37:24.350
My old co-host still
trying to co-host me there.

37:24.875 --> 37:28.770
Jess, tell me, was that
what drove you up there?

37:29.000 --> 37:32.148
Jennifer's disappearance?
It must have been so painful.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.479
I can see you're getting upset.

37:36.667 --> 37:38.291
You must have felt so alone.

37:38.292 --> 37:41.570
I said, "Talk to Maureen", bitch!

37:41.667 --> 37:43.832
Many apologies. As you can see...

37:43.833 --> 37:45.624
Why didn't you
fucking listen to me?

37:45.625 --> 37:48.145
I told you to fucking listen to me!

37:48.333 --> 37:50.569
Jess! Jess, come back.

38:15.583 --> 38:17.522
- It's you.
- Hey.

38:17.875 --> 38:21.666
I was just checking to
see if you're... You're OK.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.166
Yeah.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.774
Never better, champ.

38:26.708 --> 38:29.310
That, er... That right?

38:32.958 --> 38:35.313
Are you gonna keep following me?

38:35.417 --> 38:37.332
Do you know where you're going?

38:37.333 --> 38:41.082
Yeah. I know where I'm going.
I'm going where I always go.

38:41.083 --> 38:42.691
Yeah?

38:45.750 --> 38:47.707
Can you walk beside
me, not behind me?

38:47.708 --> 38:49.979
'Cos my arse isn't my best feature.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.082
Yeah, you, er...

38:52.083 --> 38:53.940
You mentioned that.

38:58.333 --> 39:00.499
This is where she parked it.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.688
- Parked what?
- Mum's car.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.166
My car.

39:04.167 --> 39:07.445
Well, it was gonna be my car
when Jen went to university.

39:10.125 --> 39:11.981
Found the car.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.143
Didn't find her.

39:15.083 --> 39:17.271
You know, just... Just gone.

39:19.583 --> 39:22.269
Perhaps she learnt
how to be invisible.

39:23.333 --> 39:25.236
Must be tough.

39:26.542 --> 39:28.957
My dad organised this
nationwide search.

39:28.958 --> 39:31.457
He really, really
got into it, you know.

39:31.458 --> 39:33.066
Mum...

39:33.333 --> 39:36.268
From the beginning
just gave up hope.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.190
Anyway.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.772
At least I don't have cancer.

39:47.333 --> 39:48.893
Yeah.

39:49.958 --> 39:51.518
Yeah.

39:55.625 --> 39:57.943
You don't have cancer, do you?

39:57.958 --> 39:59.518
What?

40:01.125 --> 40:03.207
I can see it. I can tell.

40:03.208 --> 40:06.749
If I look healthy, it's because of
the drug regimen I'm on right now.

40:06.750 --> 40:08.624
I've never seen you
take a single pill.

40:08.625 --> 40:11.041
Well, the drug regimen
is pretty minimal.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.815
JJ.

40:13.292 --> 40:17.767
I'm a professional liar.
You're not even a competent one.

40:22.417 --> 40:25.374
It just... It just
came out, you know.

40:25.375 --> 40:30.561
And once it... came out, I
couldn't take it back, so...

40:33.625 --> 40:35.541
You were going to
jump, weren't you?

40:35.542 --> 40:37.666
You weren't just delivering
pizzas and then you got too polite?

40:37.667 --> 40:39.499
Yeah, I was...

40:39.500 --> 40:41.356
I was going to jump, yeah.

40:41.667 --> 40:43.457
Why?

40:43.458 --> 40:45.267
Why, er...

40:46.167 --> 40:48.769
It's a simple enough question, JJ.

40:49.958 --> 40:53.355
You're a paedophile, like Martin.

40:53.458 --> 40:55.041
Oh.

40:55.042 --> 40:57.249
What are the chances of that?

40:57.250 --> 41:02.499
Four suicidalists, one roof,
two of them paedophiles.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.666
That's practically a convention.

41:04.667 --> 41:07.499
Look, I know I
shouldn't have... lied.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.482
It's just, cancer seemed...

41:11.333 --> 41:13.059
easier.

41:13.958 --> 41:17.023
- You're a strange guy, JJ.
- Huh.

41:18.792 --> 41:19.957
Fuck it, I'm stranger.

41:19.958 --> 41:23.900
I like coming and hanging out at the
place where my sister disappeared.

41:27.375 --> 41:29.480
Hmm. Look.

41:29.875 --> 41:31.041
What?

41:31.042 --> 41:33.359
Swifts.

41:33.417 --> 41:36.019
You know my favourite
thing about swifts?

41:36.333 --> 41:38.624
They nest on the wing.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.145
They're born and then they're fed.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.457
And from the moment they
leave their birthplace,

41:43.458 --> 41:45.499
they don't come down for
two years until they're ready

41:45.500 --> 41:48.374
to create other baby swifts.

41:48.375 --> 41:50.444
Oh, my gosh.

41:52.625 --> 41:54.916
You're a birdwatcher.

41:54.917 --> 41:57.768
That's why you wanted to kill yourself.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.957
No, no, I understand now.

42:02.958 --> 42:05.624
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

42:05.625 --> 42:07.398
Good, good.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.809
One elephant.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.434
Two elephants.

42:21.417 --> 42:23.439
Three elephants.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.653
Four elephants.

42:27.250 --> 42:29.319
One elephant.

42:30.083 --> 42:31.986
Two elephants.

42:32.917 --> 42:35.318
Three eleph...

42:37.292 --> 42:39.916
My first band was called Gepetto.

42:39.917 --> 42:43.749
We were a grunge band after
grunge had long been forgotten.

42:43.750 --> 42:46.815
Timing has never
been my strong suit.

42:47.417 --> 42:50.541
We came third in the Idaho
state Battle of the Bands.

42:50.542 --> 42:54.483
We got our pictures in the paper
and I was recognised in the mall.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.791
For me, that was fame.

42:57.792 --> 43:01.916
But fame like this, like
the Topper House Four...

43:01.917 --> 43:04.519
Suicide again, then, is it?

43:04.583 --> 43:06.207
Hi, Gladys.

43:06.208 --> 43:08.582
Those press still about?

43:08.583 --> 43:10.143
Yeah.

43:22.250 --> 43:25.166
In a mere three weeks,
we'd not only not died,

43:25.167 --> 43:27.832
but we'd been on the front
pages of all the tabloids

43:27.833 --> 43:32.874
and led many people to believe
again in the existence of angels,

43:32.875 --> 43:35.027
or, at least, Jess had.

43:35.083 --> 43:37.999
We even had questions asked
about us in Parliament,

43:38.000 --> 43:41.895
though that might have been
just to embarrass Jess' dad.

43:42.292 --> 43:45.124
It was Martin who
suggested getting away.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.624
He said we'd be like
Butch and Sundance.

43:47.625 --> 43:51.541
Jess reminded him that didn't
work out so well for them.

43:51.542 --> 43:53.457
But it seemed like a good idea.

43:53.458 --> 43:56.416
Get away and hope that
by the time we got back

43:56.417 --> 43:59.916
we'd be forgotten and the
world would be a kinder place.

43:59.917 --> 44:02.436
To us, and for us.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.897
I wish I had thought life
a better option than death,

44:06.083 --> 44:10.191
but I didn't, and wishing
wasn't going to fix it.

44:10.250 --> 44:12.332
To quote one of Gepetto's songs,

44:12.333 --> 44:16.707
"I don't mind the pain,
it's the hope that kills me."

44:16.708 --> 44:19.275
Yeah, we were pretty deep.

44:19.333 --> 44:20.624
OK, fiver says one of us punches

44:20.625 --> 44:21.999
one of the others before
the end of the holiday.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.666
- Punches?
- Like kicks or slaps or tickles.

44:24.667 --> 44:26.749
One of us will use physical
violence against one of the others

44:26.750 --> 44:28.541
- before the week's out.
- OK.

44:28.542 --> 44:30.249
This holiday is going
to be a disaster.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.457
Oh, I hope so.

44:31.458 --> 44:33.374
So, who's looking
after Matty, Maureen?

44:33.375 --> 44:35.499
No one. She's just left
some food in the fridge

44:35.500 --> 44:37.901
and some wet wipes by the bed.

44:38.125 --> 44:40.082
I'm sure the break will do
you both the world of good.

44:40.083 --> 44:41.666
- Yeah, that's what Dr Stephens said.
- Yeah. Yeah.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.166
- He's taken him for a week's observation.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:43.167 --> 44:45.332
- Your boarding pass, Madam.
- Yeah, go ahead.

44:45.333 --> 44:47.749
Your boarding pass, with
your flight details on it.

44:47.750 --> 44:49.855
You were handed it at check-in.

44:50.375 --> 44:51.916
This?

44:51.917 --> 44:53.999
And your passport.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.557
OK.

45:03.417 --> 45:05.143
There you go.

45:11.625 --> 45:13.124
Thank you very much.

45:13.125 --> 45:14.832
Maureen? Maureen!

45:14.833 --> 45:16.541
- Uh, no, sorry. You can't go backwards.
- Maureen, stop.

45:16.542 --> 45:17.999
Please stop, Maureen.
Please, please stop.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.749
It's just a trip, that's all.

45:19.750 --> 45:22.624
Just a trip, till all this
press nonsense blows over.

45:22.625 --> 45:25.791
- It's for the best.
- This is all... It's just all too much.

45:25.792 --> 45:27.416
I mean, I don't know you.

45:27.417 --> 45:29.853
And I don't travel
well. And I've...

45:30.625 --> 45:32.249
I've never been on a 'plane before.

45:32.250 --> 45:35.350
- You've never been on a 'plane before?
- Shut up, Jess.

45:35.667 --> 45:38.374
Maureen, if you're afraid of
flying, I've got these tablets.

45:38.375 --> 45:41.653
I'm not afraid of
flying. It's just, I'm...

45:41.750 --> 45:44.666
I didn't want to be in the papers
and I didn't want to be on TV,

45:44.667 --> 45:47.374
and I don't want to
be here now. I just...

45:47.375 --> 45:50.475
I just want to go back
to my old life, OK?

45:50.875 --> 45:54.070
But your old life wasn't
very good, Maureen.

45:54.833 --> 45:56.666
Look, we made a pact.

45:56.667 --> 46:02.041
This is the final call for
Flight CA432 to Tenerife.

46:02.042 --> 46:05.332
Will all remaining passengers
please make their way to Gate C38

46:05.333 --> 46:07.604
- immediately.
- It's gonna be fine.

46:09.375 --> 46:11.065
Come on.

46:42.292 --> 46:45.666
- To a really good holiday.
- To life.

46:45.667 --> 46:46.999
Good afternoon.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.916
My name is Angelo and
I will be your waiter.

46:49.917 --> 46:53.432
Well, sometimes I will.
Other times I will be theirs.

46:54.792 --> 46:57.124
It's just a joke. Real, but a joke.

46:57.125 --> 46:58.874
Hello, Angelo.

46:58.875 --> 47:00.707
So, you're from England? How nice.

47:00.708 --> 47:02.999
Yeah, you knew that, Angelo.
You just talked English to us.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.436
I did, I did.

47:05.667 --> 47:07.291
Is he always this
clever, your husband?

47:07.292 --> 47:09.166
He is not her husband.

47:09.167 --> 47:10.791
Let me guess.

47:10.792 --> 47:12.457
- You're all lovers, right?
- What? No.

47:12.458 --> 47:14.416
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

47:14.417 --> 47:15.707
Yeah, we are, right here.

47:15.708 --> 47:18.856
I bring Vaseline and Maureen
always brings a dildo.

47:19.375 --> 47:22.166
You know, someone told me
a joke about Vaseline once.

47:22.167 --> 47:24.457
But I can't entirely remember it.

47:24.458 --> 47:26.791
Well, Maureen, you must keep
drinking till you remember.

47:26.792 --> 47:28.457
Yeah.

47:28.458 --> 47:30.893
- We're happy. Good.
- Me, too.

47:46.500 --> 47:49.832
Oh, the sun is so fierce.

47:49.833 --> 47:52.749
And the sea's so sparkly and blue.

47:52.750 --> 47:55.707
Oh, Maureen, tell me that
you've seen the sea before.

47:55.708 --> 47:57.791
Yes, I've seen the sea before.

47:57.792 --> 47:59.124
Are we going in?

47:59.125 --> 48:00.749
- No.
- Of course we are.

48:00.750 --> 48:03.601
- We're not in our swimming costumes.
- Oh, underwear will be fine.

48:04.958 --> 48:06.582
- You don't see... No, no!
- Come on.

48:06.583 --> 48:08.249
No!

48:08.250 --> 48:10.983
Come on, grab her!
Come on, grab her!

48:45.250 --> 48:47.568
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:47.583 --> 48:49.605
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:53.833 --> 48:56.291
Maureen just called me
up on the hotel 'phone.

48:56.292 --> 48:59.356
Surprised to have her own bathroom.

48:59.542 --> 49:04.147
- She thinks this place is the height of luxury.
- Yeah, it is kind of cool, huh?

49:05.042 --> 49:07.893
Cheapest place I've
stayed in for 20 years.

49:08.375 --> 49:09.916
Yeah?

49:09.917 --> 49:12.401
It doesn't feel strange, does it?

49:12.750 --> 49:14.291
Us...

49:14.292 --> 49:16.749
- Being away together?
- No.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.332
No, it feels good.

49:18.333 --> 49:21.791
I thought I knew what I was
doing with the press and then...

49:21.792 --> 49:23.207
And then what?

49:23.208 --> 49:25.166
- The Jess meltdown and...
- No, no, no.

49:25.167 --> 49:29.061
Then I realised I'd got it all
wrong. I thought people would like it.

49:29.333 --> 49:31.916
I thought we'd make money and
people would find it eccentric

49:31.917 --> 49:34.166
- and heart-warming.
- Heart-warming?

49:34.167 --> 49:39.749
Four people survive suicide,
find hope, blah, blah, you know.

49:39.750 --> 49:43.312
I mean, it's the kind of
good-news story the press love.

49:46.500 --> 49:48.143
However,

49:49.667 --> 49:52.482
I underestimated how
much they hate me.

49:52.750 --> 49:55.649
It's not just about you, Martin.

49:56.208 --> 49:58.230
You know,

49:59.083 --> 50:01.022
I envy you.

50:01.375 --> 50:05.103
You, your cancer. I
mean, it's so cut and dry.

50:05.417 --> 50:09.666
No, really. Really, JJ, I
am so impressed with you.

50:09.667 --> 50:12.400
I mean, you hardly
let it phase you.

50:12.583 --> 50:14.832
And that is something to drink to.

50:14.833 --> 50:16.985
Here you go.

50:17.583 --> 50:19.522
Put hairs on your chest.

50:23.417 --> 50:25.320
Your health.

50:29.917 --> 50:33.148
Do you know what I feel when
I wake up in the mornings?

50:35.375 --> 50:37.314
Humiliated.

50:39.083 --> 50:41.520
Do you know what I
feel at lunchtime?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.643
Humiliated.

50:44.167 --> 50:48.499
My life is a constant
stream of humiliation.

50:48.500 --> 50:51.778
I don't feel sad. I don't
feel angry. I just feel...

50:52.667 --> 50:54.523
Humiliated.

50:56.583 --> 50:58.226
Yeah.

50:58.958 --> 51:01.229
To humiliation.

51:05.375 --> 51:09.416
OK, God gives you three wishes.

51:09.417 --> 51:12.541
Oh, God's not a
tombola machine, Martin.

51:12.542 --> 51:15.124
He doesn't just give wishes.

51:15.125 --> 51:16.916
Three wishes. Anything you want.

51:16.917 --> 51:18.957
That's easy. OK, billions of pounds

51:18.958 --> 51:22.749
- and my own personal hitman...
- OK.

51:22.750 --> 51:25.916
and a court waiver

51:25.917 --> 51:28.401
over anything that I want to do.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.520
- Really? Um...
- Mmm-hmm.

51:31.750 --> 51:36.225
Well, I'd... I'd
want a bit more help.

51:36.667 --> 51:39.103
A bit more of a life.

51:39.375 --> 51:41.374
What's a bit more of a life?

51:41.375 --> 51:43.895
Just what other people have.

51:44.083 --> 51:47.397
What do other people have?

51:47.542 --> 51:49.582
And I'd wish my son all better.

51:49.583 --> 51:51.735
That's why I don't do wishes.

51:53.750 --> 51:57.541
I'd want to be famous again,
the right kind of famous.

51:57.542 --> 51:59.457
I mean, being famous is great.

51:59.458 --> 52:01.707
Everyone think it's
difficult, but it's not.

52:01.708 --> 52:04.457
I mean, you get to have the
best seats in restaurants.

52:04.458 --> 52:08.041
People smile at you
on 'planes. It's great.

52:08.042 --> 52:12.332
And whatever you do, you feel
vindicated by your own fame.

52:12.333 --> 52:16.061
And you never ever feel humiliated.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.457
Well, it's certainly better
than real life, anyway.

52:20.458 --> 52:22.249
Wow!

52:22.250 --> 52:24.355
You're so deep.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.624
No, I'm just honest.

52:26.625 --> 52:28.999
- Martin! It's...
- What?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.707
You're nothing if
you're not noticed.

52:30.708 --> 52:33.109
OK, fame or your kids?

52:34.500 --> 52:36.541
- Mmm...
- Martin, you don't mean that.

52:36.542 --> 52:38.249
Don't I?

52:38.250 --> 52:42.109
All right, this is a bad game.

52:47.292 --> 52:49.100
OK.

52:49.375 --> 52:53.400
I wonder what JJ would
choose as his three wishes.

52:54.167 --> 52:56.082
'Cos, obviously, you'd...

52:56.083 --> 52:59.397
You'd want to cure your
cancer, for a start.

53:01.125 --> 53:03.541
I'm going to go,
uh, use the restroom.

53:03.542 --> 53:05.499
Then you'd probably
want loads of money

53:05.500 --> 53:08.067
so that you could donate
it to Cancer Research.

53:08.292 --> 53:10.957
You know, other people
are allowed to be in pain.

53:10.958 --> 53:12.861
You know that, Jess?

53:17.292 --> 53:20.060
Hey, mis amigos ingleses.

53:20.458 --> 53:21.724
How are we doing tonight?

53:23.375 --> 53:24.874
No, it's... Just leave it.

53:24.875 --> 53:26.916
Peachy, Angelo. Peachy.

53:26.917 --> 53:29.271
Great. Keep drinking.

53:37.208 --> 53:39.195
You're sitting in my seat.

53:39.625 --> 53:41.249
What?

53:41.250 --> 53:45.207
Uh, I'd find another seat, but
you're also sitting on my shawl.

53:45.208 --> 53:47.277
Oh, shit, sorry.

53:48.542 --> 53:50.350
- There.
- Thanks.

53:56.458 --> 53:59.558
You know, I think I
recognise you from somewhere.

54:00.042 --> 54:01.684
Ah.

54:01.917 --> 54:04.934
Yeah, um... There's this thing...

54:05.625 --> 54:09.851
That may have been in the
papers a bit recently, so...

54:10.458 --> 54:12.610
No, that's not it.

54:16.625 --> 54:18.315
Are you in a band?

54:19.417 --> 54:21.106
- What?
- Yeah.

54:21.375 --> 54:23.082
- You supported Alt-J.
- Yeah.

54:23.083 --> 54:25.650
- Manchester Towers.
- Two years ago.

54:25.750 --> 54:27.582
It was the first time
we came to Britain.

54:27.583 --> 54:29.166
- You're the front man, right?
- Yeah.

54:29.167 --> 54:31.484
I remember loving your lyrics.

54:31.667 --> 54:36.059
Really? Yeah, wow! You
know, I... I wrote those.

54:36.208 --> 54:39.652
Adolescent shit mostly.

54:40.375 --> 54:42.541
Are you still serious about it?

54:42.542 --> 54:44.315
Er...

54:44.583 --> 54:46.916
I was. Now, not so.

54:46.917 --> 54:48.725
What's your name?

54:48.750 --> 54:50.357
JJ.

54:50.708 --> 54:52.666
Which stands for?

54:52.667 --> 54:56.641
Er... John Julius.

54:58.625 --> 55:01.082
Hi, John Julius.

55:01.083 --> 55:02.499
I'm Kathy.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.102
Hello, Kathy.

55:07.417 --> 55:09.143
Wow!

55:16.667 --> 55:20.041
This is brilliant! Yeah!

55:20.042 --> 55:22.124
- I love it. This is beautiful.
- Yeah.

55:22.125 --> 55:23.707
Beautiful!

55:23.708 --> 55:27.582
- Who's that?
- That is, uh, my uncle.

55:27.583 --> 55:29.957
Ah! I think I recognise him.

55:29.958 --> 55:32.207
Yeah. He's, uh...
He's vaguely famous.

55:32.208 --> 55:34.999
Ah, a failed musician with
a vaguely famous uncle.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.374
I am a lucky girl.

55:36.375 --> 55:37.874
I enjoy it all the time, Angelo.

55:37.875 --> 55:39.778
See you later, mate.

55:53.833 --> 55:55.707
- Come on, let's go!
- Go where?

55:55.708 --> 55:57.582
- We're going to go dance.
- No, no, no, I'm happy to watch.

55:57.583 --> 55:59.166
- No, no, come on.
- Martin, I don't...

55:59.167 --> 56:00.856
Come on!

56:21.833 --> 56:23.606
Whoa!

56:31.375 --> 56:35.435
- So, uh, you're out here on your own?
- Mmm-hmm.

56:36.583 --> 56:39.648
Other people just crowd it
and make it about themselves.

56:40.375 --> 56:42.041
So you're... You're
here with family?

56:42.042 --> 56:43.374
Your uncle and...

56:43.375 --> 56:48.561
Uh, yeah, a bit of
family, friends, sort of.

56:49.750 --> 56:52.186
But you don't like them?

56:52.583 --> 56:54.957
I mean, you ran away
from them at the bar.

56:54.958 --> 56:57.999
No, it's just they
can be a little, um...

56:58.000 --> 57:01.314
- A little intense, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

57:02.167 --> 57:05.398
And you don't like intense?

57:05.542 --> 57:07.859
No, uh...

57:07.917 --> 57:12.582
Yeah, I can't really
talk because I'm intense.

57:12.583 --> 57:15.150
Good.

57:15.792 --> 57:18.207
Because if you're looking
for a neurosis-free girl,

57:18.208 --> 57:19.832
you're bang out of luck.

57:19.833 --> 57:21.666
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

57:21.667 --> 57:23.499
- Really?
- Yeah, I...

57:23.500 --> 57:26.807
I once set fire to my hair
just to see what would happen.

57:27.875 --> 57:30.791
I was 10 and it
didn't improve my look.

57:30.792 --> 57:32.457
Oh, that's, that's nothing.

57:32.458 --> 57:37.707
When I was a kid, I jumped off our
roof just to see if I could hurt myself.

57:37.708 --> 57:41.999
And, um, yeah, I
broke my leg and I...

57:42.000 --> 57:43.291
I kind of liked it.

57:43.292 --> 57:45.291
OK, well, how's this for psycho?

57:45.292 --> 57:48.291
I carved my
ex-boyfriend's initials

57:48.292 --> 57:50.041
- into my left inner thigh...
- Ah...

57:50.042 --> 57:52.874
as a way of telling him that
no-one else would ever see there.

57:52.875 --> 57:54.861
- Beat that.
- Um...

57:55.042 --> 57:56.832
Easy. I...

57:56.833 --> 58:01.124
I recently told some
people that I had cancer

58:01.125 --> 58:04.166
to avoid telling
them the real reason

58:04.167 --> 58:07.101
I had for attempting suicide.

58:07.667 --> 58:09.374
That is intense.

58:09.375 --> 58:12.749
- What... What was the... real reason?
- I...

58:12.750 --> 58:14.938
You know what? I don't know.

58:14.958 --> 58:18.355
I do know that I am
now part of a pact

58:18.458 --> 58:22.318
- that I had to lie to become a...
- What pact?

58:23.833 --> 58:25.559
Just a...

58:26.208 --> 58:29.749
Just a bunch of desperate
people being desperate together

58:29.750 --> 58:33.194
as a way of feeling a
little less desperate.

58:35.333 --> 58:38.149
OK, you win the psycho game.

58:38.958 --> 58:43.184
Good. Good. I always
wanted to win that game.

59:00.167 --> 59:02.916
I haven't done this
for a while, so...

59:02.917 --> 59:04.643
Mmm.

59:46.458 --> 59:48.999
- OK, now I'm going to say something.
- Oh, fuck!

59:49.000 --> 59:51.082
Because if I wait and say
nothing and then you spot me

59:51.083 --> 59:53.707
after you've pissed, I think
that would probably be worse.

59:53.708 --> 59:55.957
Wait, how did...
How did you even...

59:55.958 --> 59:57.832
Just took a credit card
and a bit of spit, you know.

59:57.833 --> 01:00:00.851
Hotel security is
not what it should be.

01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:03.776
How long have you been there?

01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:12.582
I just really wanted to
apologise for earlier.

01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:13.874
Because I don't know...

01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:15.897
I don't know why I said that.

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:19.394
And then I was probably
gonna try and shag you.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:23.499
She's really pretty, though,

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.666
So, well done.

01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:25.832
- Hey...
- You don't have to say anything.

01:00:25.833 --> 01:00:29.645
You can take that one
as a compliment.

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:33.110
Then, I'll just leave quietly.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:35.541
Hey, uh, Jess...

01:00:35.542 --> 01:00:39.685
You know, I really would prefer
it if you didn't say anything.

01:00:41.833 --> 01:00:44.649
You do know she's a
journalist though, right?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.528
- What?
- Look in her bag.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:51.360
'Cos I saw her check
her recorder in the bar.

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:56.934
- Oh, my God!
- Still, she fucked you, though, right?

01:00:57.958 --> 01:01:00.608
So, at least she's thorough.

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:03.941
Hey, hey.

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:14.332
"What pact?"

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:17.999
"Just... just a bunch
of desperate people

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.124
"being desperate together

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:22.724
"as a way of feeling a
little less desperate."

01:03:12.417 --> 01:03:14.439
I think it's sweet.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:16.666
I think it's unsanitary.

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:20.041
No, only part of you thinks that.
The other part thinks it's sweet.

01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:22.749
Oh... Hmm.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:24.916
- Why are you waiting here?
- I'm waiting for them to finish

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:27.666
this tray of scrambled egg
and bring in a new tray.

01:03:27.667 --> 01:03:30.666
But the scrambled egg's
never fresh, Martin.

01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:32.541
I mean, I might not have
been on a lot of holidays,

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:36.436
but I've been in a lot of hospitals
and I understand institutional catering.

01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:41.021
Who are all these people
and why do they eat so much?

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:43.977
They're having a
good time, that's all.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.355
- Martin.
- Hmm?

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:52.275
Thank you for
arranging this holiday.

01:03:52.292 --> 01:03:53.749
I think it's been good for me.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:58.106
You really don't understand what
a disaster we all are, do you?

01:03:58.542 --> 01:04:03.624
- Come on, let's get you some breakfast.
- Yeah, good idea, good idea.

01:04:03.625 --> 01:04:07.318
- The prunes are very good.
- Don't like prunes.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.733
- Hi.
- Oh, morning, JJ.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.476
I may have said some
stupid things last night.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.916
Drink has never been my friend.

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:38.499
- Sorry about that.
- So, I got a few things to say.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.832
I don't think you're
gonna like any of them.

01:04:41.833 --> 01:04:43.082
Are you going back to America?

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:46.646
Yeah, I'm gonna start with
the... the biggest... Um...

01:04:46.792 --> 01:04:51.291
I don't have cancer of the... the brain.

01:04:51.292 --> 01:04:53.957
- I don't have CCR.
- Oh, they've cured you!

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:58.332
No, Maureen, I,
uh... I never had it.

01:04:58.333 --> 01:05:00.832
- I... I made it all up.
- Oh.

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:04.291
There's actually no
such thing as... as CCR.

01:05:04.292 --> 01:05:06.499
It's just Creedence
Clearwater Revival are

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.999
one of my favourite bands, but...

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.582
Oh. I wasn't gonna say anything.

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:11.749
Did you know about this?

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.457
You know, I thought there
was something strange.

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.582
So, why, hmm?

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:17.166
Why, JJ, were you up there?

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:18.832
He can't answer
that. That's personal.

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:22.499
- I'm sure he had good reasons.
- Oh, did he? JJ, did you?

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.403
Yeah, um...

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:29.957
Guys, actually, I'm gonna need
to postpone this conversation...

01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:32.166
We... We had a pact.

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:35.082
I... I trusted you. I liked you!

01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:37.582
Hey, Martin, please, just sit down.
We'll talk about this another time.

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:40.980
- Another time? What time would you...
- Hey, where were you?

01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:44.249
Oh, right, great. We all stop
for your girlfriend, do we?

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:47.666
She's not my girlfriend,
OK? She's...

01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:51.124
- She's a journalist.
- What?

01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:52.624
- Look, I didn't know.
- Shit.

01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:54.207
You don't know much, do you?

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:56.582
If he didn't know, he didn't know.

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:58.874
I mean, we've had bad things
written about us before.

01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:03.041
Look, I understand that you
are angry, but, please, Martin,

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.832
- I'm feeling pretty humiliated...
- Oh, you don't understand anything!

01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:07.832
You certainly don't
understand humiliation!

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:10.666
- Martin, you're being dramatic.
- You're a leech! You're a fake!

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:13.457
- You're a fraud! You're a joke, JJ.
- Martin, stop this.

01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:15.791
- John...
- Who the fuck is John?

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:18.082
I'm... Look, I'm John.

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:19.582
And you know what?

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:22.291
- I'm not a fraud.
- Stop it. Remember the pact.

01:06:22.292 --> 01:06:24.563
Fuck the pact!

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.891
I'm not a fraud!

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:35.060
Don't you ever touch me again!

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:37.061
Good morning, sunshine.

01:07:37.542 --> 01:07:39.528
Hello, sweetheart.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:43.541
Hello, sleepy head.

01:07:43.542 --> 01:07:46.791
How are you? Good morning.

01:07:46.792 --> 01:07:48.541
All right, here we go.

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:50.707
"Not having Matty with
me on the holiday,

01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:53.559
"it... it felt like
I was missing a leg.

01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:55.892
"Strange.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.226
"Light.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.434
"That's probably not
like missing a leg at all.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:04.374
"I don't imagine most
people's first impressions

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:06.563
"of leg loss is weightlessness."

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:15.195
How's that?

01:08:15.542 --> 01:08:17.184
There we are.

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:24.041
"I missed him most when
the 'plane was landing.

01:08:24.042 --> 01:08:26.147
"We shook a little on descent.

01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:28.777
"I thought I was going to die.

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:31.818
"And I hadn't said goodbye.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:56.060
"JJ's girlfriend's piece meant
the story, our story, didn't die.

01:08:56.417 --> 01:08:58.499
"But Martin said to
concentrate on being boring

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.901
"and they'd eventually
leave us alone.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:04.647
"So, that's what I
did. Not difficult.

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:07.207
"And, as for the others,

01:09:07.207 --> 01:09:11.916
"as soon as we landed, we scattered
in different directions like we were

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:14.152
"allergic to each other.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.666
"The pact was broken beyond repair,

01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:20.644
"and without the pact, our
friendship was broken, too.

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:26.729
"I still saw them, actually,
every now and again.

01:09:28.542 --> 01:09:32.685
"I saw Jess in places
she shouldn't be.

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:37.277
"And I did make a
little effort to find JJ,

01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:39.916
"just to check he was OK."

01:09:39.917 --> 01:09:45.269
JJ, I can't believe...
One last time, slower!

01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:51.687
"I never saw Martin.

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:58.397
"No, mostly, I...
I got on with my life

01:09:59.042 --> 01:10:01.857
"and hoped they
got on with theirs."

01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:18.734
Matty did really well.

01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:21.727
We did some
interesting reflex work.

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:26.249
Nice to have him properly
looked after for once.

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.124
He reacted well to company.

01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:30.624
I'm sure he loved a change
from my blathering.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:33.275
We couldn't get him
out of this pool.

01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:35.124
Well, he's always loved water.

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:36.916
You know, er, there might be a

01:10:36.917 --> 01:10:41.143
slot for him to come to one of my
weekly sessions, if you'd like it.

01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:44.310
Oh, I'm sure he'd love it.

01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:46.610
I'll add him to the list.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:50.894
You know, you look like
you've caught a bit of colour.

01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:53.439
Do I?

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.582
You know, from the
pictures in the papers,

01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:03.153
it looked like you
picked a very nice spot.

01:11:04.875 --> 01:11:06.482
Yes.

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:08.600
Well...

Matty.

01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:52.695
Matty.

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:57.778
No. No.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.148
Matty?

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:10.397
Oh, Matty!

01:13:23.167 --> 01:13:26.267
We'll let you know as soon
as there's any information.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.359
- Hey, Maureen.
- Oh!

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:13.146
Ah...

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:25.416
Oh, you came, too!

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:28.232
Yeah. Nothing on TV.

01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:32.608
Uh, this is my dad. He drove me.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:34.291
He'll probably say
something very moving.

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:36.541
I'm sorry to hear
about your son, Maureen.

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:40.401
It's not one of his
best attempts, is it?

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:44.166
I'm really... I'm really
grateful you're all...

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:46.624
You're all here.

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:48.481
Of course we're here.

01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:55.749
This isn't tea.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:56.957
No, I know. It's hot chocolate.

01:14:56.958 --> 01:14:58.624
- But I asked for tea.
- Well, I was buying

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:00.624
and I don't like the smell of tea.

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:03.524
- So, when you buy rounds in pubs...
- Pink gins.

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:05.707
Then you never have to
buy a round ever again.

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:07.499
It's clever, right, hmm?

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.356
Is JJ still not here, then?

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:11.916
I... I couldn't get through to him.

01:15:11.917 --> 01:15:13.874
He's probably not
picked up his messages.

01:15:13.875 --> 01:15:16.499
Yeah, it's either that or he doesn't
really care. It's one or the other.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.332
I genuinely don't know
how you've survived her.

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:21.041
- Ear plugs.
- I am going to make you

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:22.374
go and sit in the car in a minute.

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.791
Ear plugs and pink gin.

01:15:24.792 --> 01:15:27.477
He wasn't the reason
I was up there.

01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:29.232
Matty.

01:15:30.167 --> 01:15:31.856
He wasn't.

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:34.768
No?

01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:38.778
There were lots of reasons
I was up on that roof.

01:15:39.917 --> 01:15:42.851
You once asked me why, Jess.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.727
And... I said... I
said I felt helpless.

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:58.271
But the truth is, I'd not... I'd not
done a list for living and a list for...

01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:04.019
It... It was a
feeling. Not a thought.

01:16:06.917 --> 01:16:09.188
But not one of those reasons

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:14.067
was that I didn't love my son.

01:16:14.125 --> 01:16:16.349
Not one of them, not one.

01:16:22.917 --> 01:16:25.271
Maureen, we know that.

01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:37.249
Oh, God! Oh, no, no, no, no, no...

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:38.541
- No, no, no.
- Don't tell me...

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:40.666
He's fine. Maureen. Maureen...

01:16:40.667 --> 01:16:42.570
He's fine.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.166
- What?
- We're gonna keep monitoring him.

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:47.235
But he's no longer critical.

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:50.416
- He'll be fine.
- He'll be fine?

01:16:50.417 --> 01:16:53.057
- Yeah, he'll be fine.
- OK.

01:16:54.542 --> 01:16:56.707
Now, the tubes look
worse than they are.

01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:59.832
We'll remove some tonight and the
rest, hopefully, will be out tomorrow.

01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:03.541
Oh! I should have seen it coming.

01:17:03.542 --> 01:17:05.999
If he'd had... If he'd
had proper care then...

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.060
Maureen... you saved him.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.316
It was a myocardial infarction.

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:17.499
He... He had a heart
attack of sorts.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.901
His symptoms were almost invisible.

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:25.397
I didn't notice it. I was
monitoring it and I didn't...

01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:28.819
But you caught it.

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:31.610
You saved his life.

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.813
Matty's a very lucky
boy to have you.

01:17:41.042 --> 01:17:43.277
I only had one thought.

01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:46.190
When he...

01:17:48.542 --> 01:17:51.855
If he dies, I die.

01:17:53.542 --> 01:17:55.729
Well, he lived.

01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:05.309
And maybe he feels the same way
about you as you do about him.

01:18:06.583 --> 01:18:08.901
Have you ever considered that?

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:21.832
- It's Valentine's Day.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:18:21.833 --> 01:18:22.999
- Martin.
- Yeah?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.957
- Today is Valentine's Day.
- Good.

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:26.166
- Martin.
- Yeah.

01:18:26.167 --> 01:18:29.541
Breakfast TV's completely messed
up your brain, hasn't it? Come on.

01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:32.999
- Oh, JJ! The pact!
- Get Maureen. I'm gonna find JJ now.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.235
Yeah. Oh, shit.

01:18:57.458 --> 01:19:00.582
Have you... Have you seen JJ?

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:02.624
JJ is gone.

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:04.374
- Gone?
- Yeah, he's a prick.

01:19:04.375 --> 01:19:07.902
He left over a week ago.
He didn't even serve notice.

01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:14.235
That prick you're talking about, Paolo,
happens to be my daughter's friend.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.069
And you'd do well to remember that.

01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:26.807
You are called Paolo, aren't you?

01:19:29.542 --> 01:19:32.903
It's just that it says
Paolo's Place outside and you

01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:37.519
certainly sound Italian.
You look Italian and...

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:42.518
- Love your tats.
- Come on, Dad.

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:53.707
- Hello?
- Oh, er... yes. Hi, hi, hello.

01:19:53.708 --> 01:19:56.275
- What?
- I'm looking for JJ.

01:19:56.708 --> 01:19:59.559
- Who?
- John Julius.

01:20:20.083 --> 01:20:21.691
Oh, JJ.

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:38.479
I hoped you wouldn't be up here.

01:21:40.792 --> 01:21:44.791
You know, three people have killed
themselves from this building

01:21:44.792 --> 01:21:47.063
between New Year's and today?

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:53.478
Sue Chalmott, housewife
and manic depressive.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:58.749
Um, David Frommet, banker
who lost everything.

01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:03.916
And, er, Ben Peterson.
He was only 15.

01:22:03.917 --> 01:22:07.749
So, you're going to join them?

01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:10.249
I kept to the pact, Martin, OK?

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:14.192
This, me, it's none
of your business now.

01:22:14.333 --> 01:22:19.354
True. Why, though, JJ?
Why are you up here?

01:22:19.958 --> 01:22:25.394
That's the thing, Martin.
I... I didn't lie to you.

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:29.749
- I don't know.
- You... don't know?

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:33.124
And that makes my reason
better than any of yours.

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:36.190
I wasn't aware that
this was a competition.

01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:42.152
You see, all Jess needs
is to feel important.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:47.944
Maureen, she needs to feel loved.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.570
And you, you just... You
just need to grow a brain.

01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:56.440
Fair enough.

01:22:56.958 --> 01:23:01.896
See, you can solve your
problems, but me, I can't.

01:23:02.208 --> 01:23:03.749
Just, Martin... Martin, stop.

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:08.439
Martin, just stop walking.
Three steps and I'm gone. Just...

01:23:10.042 --> 01:23:11.850
Oh, God!

01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:15.984
Look, I'm just... I'm just tired

01:23:17.208 --> 01:23:21.624
of, er, of being
scared all the time

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:24.227
and not knowing why.
I'm tired of being...

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:29.564
Trying... Trying to
change and not knowing how.

01:23:29.917 --> 01:23:35.683
You know, leaving my latest
shit band, moving countries.

01:23:38.167 --> 01:23:42.310
Because however much I do change,

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:46.605
I'm left with me.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.393
Sounds like you've got
it all worked out, JJ.

01:23:54.542 --> 01:23:58.732
It's logical. The reason why you wanna
die is because you don't wanna live.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.730
It's as simple as that, right?

01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:05.189
I used to think like that, too.

01:24:05.542 --> 01:24:07.149
JJ.

01:24:09.917 --> 01:24:11.749
- And then there were four.
- Don't you get it?

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.874
I mean, we made it, all right?

01:24:13.875 --> 01:24:17.166
We all made it to Valentine's
Day and nothing, OK?

01:24:17.167 --> 01:24:20.066
Nothing, absolutely
nothing has changed!

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:23.291
But everything has changed.

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:25.360
- What?
- Everything.

01:24:26.667 --> 01:24:30.124
We are standing in entirely
different positions,

01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:32.775
for one thing.

01:24:32.958 --> 01:24:35.624
I didn't ever want to be up here again,
JJ. I'm pretty sure none of us did.

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:40.195
He's right. You know,
it's shit up here.

01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:42.820
I... I hope...

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:47.521
I think we still matter to you, JJ.

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:51.898
I mean, why else would
you pick Valentine's Day?

01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:55.402
You may think you want to die,

01:24:56.583 --> 01:24:58.901
but you knew we'd look for you.

01:25:01.208 --> 01:25:03.124
We're not up here
because we wanna die.

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.981
We're here for you.

01:25:05.042 --> 01:25:07.064
The Topper House Four.

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:10.207
We belong together. We're a team.

01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:13.749
We're the worst team the world has
ever known and if I was picking,

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:16.945
none of you would have made it
onto the subs' bench, but still,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.607
we're a team.

01:25:22.042 --> 01:25:26.102
I know, it's not much, son.

01:25:26.625 --> 01:25:33.815
But maybe we're a start.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.686
You can't even see the bottom.

01:26:14.375 --> 01:26:16.101
Hello?

01:26:17.375 --> 01:26:20.291
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

01:26:20.292 --> 01:26:22.624
We can hear you and
see you, Martin.

01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.791
Bonsoir, Martin.

01:26:24.792 --> 01:26:27.416
Where's the button for this?

01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:29.166
Oh, hiya.

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:32.874
Maureen, is that
glitter on your face?

01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:35.457
No, no, no... Yes.

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.374
Matty... Matty seems
to like glitter.

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:42.082
And we're having a kind of
a... Well, New Year's Eve party.

01:26:42.083 --> 01:26:44.749
Maureen, you rager!

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:46.582
Jess, please!

01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:49.541
I'm trying to keep the
noise down out here, OK? Shh.

01:26:49.542 --> 01:26:52.582
It was Dr Stephen's, er...
Robert's idea, actually.

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:55.249
Yeah, he's been hugely helpful.

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.124
In return for me
joining his quiz team,

01:26:57.125 --> 01:27:01.249
which has caused much controversy because
I was supposed to join another quiz team

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.189
and it's kind of complicated.

01:27:03.208 --> 01:27:05.624
Sounds complicated.

01:27:05.625 --> 01:27:07.041
I saw your Dad got promoted, Jess.

01:27:07.042 --> 01:27:08.457
OK, we must have
better news than that.

01:27:08.458 --> 01:27:10.832
Come on, somebody
say something. Martin?

01:27:10.833 --> 01:27:13.541
Why don't you stoke up this party?

01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:17.567
Why don't you tell us about some of
your most recent bedtime conquests?

01:27:17.958 --> 01:27:22.315
Well, I'm often asleep by
10:00, on my own, exhausted.

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:26.900
Are children famous for getting you
up early in the morning? I had no idea.

01:27:27.417 --> 01:27:30.707
God, when did we all turn into
Little House on the fucking Prairie?

01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:32.944
I've missed you...

01:27:33.417 --> 01:27:35.749
- All.
- You know, I, uh...

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:39.312
I got something to
say. My therapist...

01:27:39.333 --> 01:27:40.957
Therapist? There we
go, that's some news.

01:27:40.958 --> 01:27:43.166
Did you all know JJ
is now officially mad?

01:27:43.167 --> 01:27:44.832
Er... Jess...

01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:46.582
You see a therapist, too.

01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:48.666
Yeah, of course, but all the best
people are mad, in my opinion.

01:27:48.667 --> 01:27:50.819
My therapist

01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:54.320
told me a story, a true
story about this guy

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.916
who survived jumping off
the Golden Gate bridge.

01:27:56.917 --> 01:27:58.916
It's an anecdote,
it's not strictly news.

01:27:58.917 --> 01:28:04.874
The moment he jumped he realised that
the only thing in his life he couldn't fix

01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:07.276
was the thing he'd just done.

01:28:07.667 --> 01:28:11.457
I mean, can you imagine those,
those five seconds as he fell?

01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:13.666
The agony of that.

01:28:13.667 --> 01:28:15.124
Well, to me...

01:28:15.125 --> 01:28:22.397
It feels like I fell without
falling because of you guys.

01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:29.444
I had my five seconds up on
that roof and not in the air.

01:28:29.708 --> 01:28:33.401
Hmm. Five seconds.

01:28:34.583 --> 01:28:37.317
We each gave each
other five seconds.

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:40.272
I like that, JJ.

01:28:40.542 --> 01:28:45.957
And then five seconds turned
into a year, into a life sentence.

01:28:45.958 --> 01:28:48.807
You people make me
want to kill myself.

01:28:50.417 --> 01:28:51.791
Maureen, are you coming?

01:28:51.792 --> 01:28:53.707
No, no, I'm just
talking to my friends.

01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:56.707
It's almost midnight and we're
doing the Lambada, come on.

01:28:56.708 --> 01:28:58.082
Maureen, where are you going?

01:28:58.083 --> 01:28:59.624
Maureen!

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:00.874
Happy New Year!

01:29:00.875 --> 01:29:02.980
OK.

01:29:03.208 --> 01:29:07.457
OK, what just happened? Did Maureen just
make us look like we're the square ones?

01:29:07.458 --> 01:29:11.483
Remember, you're the one who
accused her of having too many cats.

01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:12.957
Time to sign off.

01:29:12.958 --> 01:29:14.541
Happy New Year, Jess.

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:16.315
Happy New Year, Martin.

01:29:18.792 --> 01:29:21.442
Happy New Year, Jess.

01:29:21.917 --> 01:29:24.318
Happy New Year, John Julius.

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:34.166
We could go to a party, you know?

01:29:34.167 --> 01:29:38.499
In case you were worried about
being upstaged by Maureen.

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.249
Well, that's just the
problem, though, isn't it?

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.734
I don't really want
to go to a party.

01:29:43.917 --> 01:29:45.249
Yeah.

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:47.770
I think you've broken me.

01:29:49.583 --> 01:29:52.124
- Don't smile.
- No?

01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:53.957
- I will kill you...
- I know.

01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:56.064
If you smile.

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:11.526
Come on. Up to bed, sleepy
head. There you go. Good girl.

01:30:14.833 --> 01:30:18.894
There you go. Oh,
yes, there you go.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.082
Is it midnight yet?

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:25.101
Yes, it is.

01:30:25.833 --> 01:30:29.645
You made it. Another new year.

01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:32.570
Here we go.
