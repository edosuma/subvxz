12:55.600 --> 12:56.600
Nothing.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.635
Where's Raza keep his ciggies?
I know he hides them from me.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.200
No, I hide them from you.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.496
You don't, do you? SADIA: Hanif!

13:04.520 --> 13:05.954
What are you actually looking for?

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
I don't know.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.559
Do you want to know
his secret hiding spot?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.119
He thinks he's so bloody smart.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.991
Who puts a bean bag on the balcony?

13:18.440 --> 13:19.440
Look.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.280
Nah. That's not what I'm looking for.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.456
NASIR: I'll be down in a sec.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.358
That'll be the boys.
Put it back. Put it back.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.480
I'll keep them busy.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.197
Hand to God, whatever's in that tin,
nothing to do with me, Mr Shar.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.111
I believe you, Carl.
Millions wouldn't, but I do.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.715
CARL: Well, I'm touched, mate.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.160
Hey, son, I do have a question
for a man in your profession.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.360
Ask away.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.074
This mate of mine
comes round the pub the other day.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.877
We're all just talking, nothing special,
bunch of old lefties.

13:57.160 --> 14:01.871
Anyway, I notice he's got a little camera
on his jacket.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.039
That ain't a mate, that's a snitch.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.879
Hang on. I ain't told you the 'ole story.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.640
Yeah, well what's to know?
Your mate is a snitch. You should do 'im.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.195
I've known him a long time.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.910
Don't matter how long
you've been friendly with a snake.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.680
It's still prone to bite you, innit.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.554
RAZA: Geezer at the shop said that's best
one for a wannabe paparazzo.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
NASIR: Sound.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.031
What is this? Leica?

14:28.120 --> 14:30.600
I don't know what they call it.
Whatever it is, it ain't cheap.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.958
Why you trynna bribe me?
What d'you want?

14:33.040 --> 14:35.794
Your brother bought you a nice present.
How about a thank you?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.832
OK. Thank you.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.200
Where did you get the money for that then?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.631
No-where.
Just, uh, got my overtime, didn't I.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.837
So, when do I get my bloody gift then,
huh?

14:49.880 --> 14:52.031
GABE: Source nine put in a good shift
at the funeral.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.399
One of these faces might be
Yousef's connection to El Adoua.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.719
Cross-check names with the watch list.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.231
If you don't have a name, work the snouts.
Find one.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.911
We know this one, don't we?
Oh Christ.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.752
That's, uh, Akash Williams.
He's a keyboard jihadi.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.639
Popped up on a GCHQ watch list.
I looked in on him last year.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.831
His online profile
is sympathetic to the cause.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.437
IMRAN: El Adoua comes through London,
never steps foot on public transport

15:16.880 --> 15:19.076
no phone calls, all cash transactions.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.440
That's trade craft.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.555
This guy, Akash

15:23.200 --> 15:26.193
failed all his GCSEs
and he lives with his grandma and grandad.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.677
I think our Big-shot is a touch more
sophisticated that that, darling.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.840
Well, we still have to rule him out.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.395
That's my spot at the grill, the driver,
with the white van. That's him.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.720
GABE: OK.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.576
OFFICER:
I thought MIT ruled out the owner already?

15:40.600 --> 15:44.196
HOLLY: The registered owner,
some 87-year-old with vascular dementia.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.711
Someone clearly registered the van
in his name.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.038
GABE:
Well, let's prioritise getting him ID'd.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.353
GABE: My snout's working Yousef's brother.
Holly, let's knock Akash off the list.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.520
HOLLY: OK.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.280
SAL: Also gonna need
that 50 pound registration fee, brother.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.156
What do you need my dad's number for?
The guy is useless.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.256
SAL: Man, just put down your mate, Dadir,
if you want.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.157
I don't actually care.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.560
It's just an emergency contact
in case you get knocked out.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.856
DADIR: Yeah, but no,
this is what I told you last time.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.480
SAL: Alright, doors are up nine to nine.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.995
And I'm not a laundry service,
so bring your own towel.

16:15.080 --> 16:19.757
OK, bro, I've got two rules, man:
No wankers. No phones.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.440
Fine by me.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.576
SAL: Alright, cool. We're gonna start you
off from the ropes, yeah.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.637
Just, uh, come this way.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.717
Alright, so we warm up over here.
And, uh, changing rooms are over there.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.400
That's where the toilets are, as well...

16:32.600 --> 16:36.037
HOLLY: "Never Trust Non-Muslims",
"Mujahideen Strategies",

16:36.360 --> 16:39.034
"Can Kuffar be Family?"...
GRANDAD: Disgusting.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.789
Kash, how can your nan not be your family?
GRANDMA: David...

16:41.880 --> 16:45.669
GRANDAD: Feeds ya three beautiful
halal meals every day, doesn't she?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.037
David. Blood pressure.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.193
If you continue to post these
on your socials, sooner or later...

16:51.280 --> 16:53.317
AKASH: I don't do nothing.
I'm just sharing.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.400
That can be enough.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.256
And it won't be us here knocking
at your door.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.919
It'll be armed units here to arrest you.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.438
Good. That bleeding-heart social worker
was supposed to help.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.878
All she did was have us cancel internet.
It's called "Prevent".

17:05.240 --> 17:07.914
All it's preventing is Trisha
from Skyping her sister.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.920
Now, she's got to go all the way
down to the café to get online.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.079
We're at the end
of a very bloody long rope here.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.071
Do you mind if we step out for a minute?

17:18.160 --> 17:19.958
It might be better
if we talk to Akash alone.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.680
You know we're more than fair with him.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.712
I don't doubt it.
We just need five minutes.

17:25.920 --> 17:26.920
Through there.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.114
GABE: Who's this cheeky chappy?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.280
Your dad's still in Brum, is he?

17:41.480 --> 17:42.480
D'you see him much?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
No one wants to go Brum.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.640
He didn't hang about, did he,
after your mum died?

17:50.520 --> 17:51.874
What would you know about my mum?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.631
GABE: I know she wouldn't want
this situation for you.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.313
I read that nonsense you post online.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.916
Now that I've met you,
you seem like an alright bloke.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.869
Grandparents are sweet enough
for a couple of geezers.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.200
Sweeter than mine, I tell you that much.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.559
So what is it, Kash?
What gets you so wound up?

18:11.640 --> 18:16.840
Not me; Qur'an, innit.
"Slay dem where you find 'em."

18:17.200 --> 18:20.159
That's actually a mistranslation.
It's "Fight them where they fight you".

18:20.440 --> 18:23.638
It says what it says. I didn't write it.
HOLLY: It's about selfdefence.

18:24.080 --> 18:24.911
The next verse says:

18:25.000 --> 18:28.277
RECITES IN ARABIC: But, if they desist,
God is forgiving and compassionate.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.776
You might have known it better
if you hadn't got kicked out your mosque.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.075
AKASH: I didn't get kicked out!

18:36.600 --> 18:38.398
That Imran's working for the CIA.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.190
The <i>Al CIA-da.</i>

18:41.560 --> 18:42.880
But yous know all about that.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.439
He's on the pay roll. Don't lie.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.472
I've been approached like four times,
you know.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.430
Tap on the shoulder, innit.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.715
And what did they ask of you?

18:55.400 --> 18:56.880
Top secret stuff probably.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.473
Who approached you?
What did they look like?

18:59.560 --> 19:01.597
It was this guy... Or they.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.520
They? So it was two people
that approached you?

19:04.600 --> 19:05.431
Mm.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.876
GABE: Their names?
- Jamie and Steve.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.997
The CIA gave you their names!
Really?

19:11.560 --> 19:13.756
So, who's Jamie and Steve
or have you got it confused?

19:14.040 --> 19:15.440
I'm not confused!
Sounds confused.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.976
GABE: There was one or two of them?
- Doesn't matter how many.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.437
Their names were Jason and Simon?
No. I said Jamie and Simon.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.512
You said Jamie and Steve.
Well, I forgot.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.434
And they said they were MI6?
Mate, no, I said CIA.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.512
MI6 or CIA?
Doesn't matter, does it?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.920
Why don't you go to Brum, Kash?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.310
Cos he doesn't want to fucking see me,
does he?

19:44.160 --> 19:46.680
"Count to ten when you get angry."
You've heard that one, I bet.

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
Hey?

19:51.560 --> 19:55.270
Thing is when I get angry
numbers escape me

19:56.520 --> 19:58.751
and before I know it,
Mr Hyde's on the prowl again.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.229
You gotta learn to control it.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.480
Here.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.435
Here's a little trick I learnt.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.960
There.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.999
Just look at the timer and breathe.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
Just breathe.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.960
You don't want us to come back here.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.916
THEY TALK INDISTINCTLY

20:52.000 --> 20:53.036
PHONE BEEPS

20:55.040 --> 20:57.760
Got an alert from the OP.
The Albanians are back.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.520
GABE: Well, let's get over there.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.280
CAR STARTS

21:17.920 --> 21:18.920
CAMERA CLICKS

21:23.160 --> 21:24.879
HOLLY OVER RADIO:
<i>Foxtrot One to control.</i>

21:25.360 --> 21:27.272
We have a subject moving south
on Aston. Over.

21:27.640 --> 21:30.360
OFFICER ON RADIO: <i>Roger that, Foxtrot One.
Do you require assistance?</i>

21:30.680 --> 21:34.196
HOLLY: Negative. We're four lengths back.
We don't expect to engage. Over.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.560
OFFICER: <i>Roger that.</i>

21:46.320 --> 21:47.416
RAZA: What's going on tonight?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.936
Promise I'll leave my dad
at home this time.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.456
DADIR: <i>You're lucky the Feds showed up.
Man, it was about to get active.</i>

21:51.480 --> 21:53.915
RAZA: Yeah. Who was that dude?
- DADIR: You don't wanna know.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.960
RAZA: So what you saying then?
Uh, meet up in a bit?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.235
Alright. Yeah. Cool.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
Next time, man.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.238
NASIR: Who were you talking to?
- Don't worry about it. Go back to sleep.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
SIREN WAILS

22:18.000 --> 22:19.656
FEMALE OFFICER ON RADIO:
<i>Go ahead, Foxtrot.</i>

22:19.680 --> 22:22.639
GABE: Yeah, I need background
on the Old Ballroom on Barking Road.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.679
See whose name's on the deed,
purchase history, whatever you got.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.549
FEMALE OFFICER: <i>Roger that.</i>

22:30.680 --> 22:31.680
Guys, you're late.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.640
- What's your ETA?
- HOLLY YAWNS.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.796
MALE OFFICER:
<i>Difficult to say. Traffic's rough.</i>

22:42.120 --> 22:43.840
Can't you just throw on
your blues and twos?

22:44.800 --> 22:47.793
MALE OFFICER: <i>Can't be having that.
Discretion is of the upmost importance.</i>

22:47.880 --> 22:49.792
GABE: That's his story.
We're wasting away here.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.310
MEN LAUGH

22:53.520 --> 22:55.280
<i>Look at that. Traffic cleared up!</i>
Bastards.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.193
Red building.
Subject entered three hours ago.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.791
I hope you've brought a book.
CAR ENGINE STARTS.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.991
HOLLY:
The Ballroom's owned by DDLM Consulting

23:10.080 --> 23:12.959
listed on the Kosovo Chamber
of Commerce as an accounting firm.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.040
It's a shell.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.560
Board members' names
are probably all picked off tombstones.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.440
Well, we should still put a call in.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.632
Charlie! Fucking hell. That you?

23:24.080 --> 23:25.080
Hey up, lad.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.159
Fucking 'ell, Nigel.
I didn't recognise you, mate.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.392
NIGEL LAUGHING: Well, you know.
Time gets every man. You and all.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.233
Thought you was off in States, California.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.551
Nah, I'm down in Florida, me,
near Disneyland, yeah.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.760
Fucking Mickey Mouse, innit.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.599
NIGEL LAUGHS: Right.
Well, done nought for the tan I see. Huh?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.479
Here, this lovely thing gotta name?

23:46.080 --> 23:48.515
Holly.
Ah, Nigel Briggs, at your service.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.074
Yeah, we're working on a construction bid,
so hopefully be over here a lot more now.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.914
Right, right.
Hey, how's it toiling for this'un, eh?

23:57.400 --> 23:58.959
He was a right maniac as I know him.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.954
Ah, yeah, he's not so bad
as long as he remembers to count to ten.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.879
Ah, yeah, sounds about right, hey.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.359
Hey, you heard Skittles bolloxed it
with a parole board?

24:09.120 --> 24:12.716
Hey, what the fuck do they know, hey?
Aye. There's always an exterior, innit.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.755
How do you two know each other?

24:16.560 --> 24:18.456
Ah, you don't want us to get into that,
you know.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.800
Too blue for your precious ears.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.434
What you doing down here anyway?

24:22.760 --> 24:24.416
Thought you said
you'd never set foot in London?

24:24.440 --> 24:25.920
Ah, I fucked right off, you know.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.431
I still stay out the PC swamp
as far as I can.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.560
But you know, when duty calls...

24:31.840 --> 24:33.194
Hey, master of disaster, huh?

24:34.120 --> 24:35.474
Sharon said you've matured.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.111
I thought like old cheese, you know,
not fine wine.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.192
Hey, come on.
You're not so bad yourself, mate.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.150

24:49.520 --> 24:51.557
Aye, now and again, now and again.
Yeah, yeah.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.831

Alright. Bye.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.680
Why are you spying on me, weirdo?

26:38.920 --> 26:40.776
Why are you spending 100 quid
on a pair of shoes?

26:40.800 --> 26:41.800
Gora wedding, innit.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.350
I can't exactly rock up
in a pair of fake creps.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.640
Who's getting married?
No one you know. See you later.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.056

- RAZA: Out.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.549

GABE: Hey.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.320
Hey.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.718
I wanted to explain something
about last night.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.595
Uh, he was a contact from your UC work.
Yeah.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.159
Yeah. And there's protocol, you know.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.914
I'm supposed to report any interaction
with anyone from that time.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.596
It's a whole song and dance, you know.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.074
I'd appreciate it if you
left this out of your duty statement.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.440
You don't write these up normally?

27:43.760 --> 27:46.320
I've never had to.
I've never had a run-in before.

27:46.440 --> 27:49.558
What about... Was it Sharon he mentioned?
Yeah.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.115
Yeah, it was ten years ago.
You know, just after the case.

27:55.000 --> 27:55.831
I'd rather leave it in.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.037
I mean, I'm still trying to get
on Rose's good side.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.191
It's only a duty statement.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.749
And anything I say will speak
to how well you kept your cover.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.240
Yeah.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.030
Hey, you never lose it.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.996
Uh, that's the training.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.758
The first thing they teach you
is how to carry yourself.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.832
See you, when you walk,
you lead with your toes.

28:26.840 --> 28:27.840
Doesn't everyone?

28:28.120 --> 28:28.951
You know, when I was a kid

28:29.040 --> 28:31.077
my dad always told me
to stand up straight, so...

28:31.680 --> 28:32.830
I lead with my chest.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.831
But Charlie's...
It's down here in the hips.

28:37.320 --> 28:40.199
And there's other things you can do,
you know, hair, clothes.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.440
Everyone's got a different way
of reaching out to the world

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
touching it.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.720
Go on, take it.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.510
Oh, she's a grabber.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.113
What about a Charlie? A Charlie?

28:55.560 --> 28:56.560
Always a squeezer.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.194
You see the problem is,
when you're the lie

29:03.800 --> 29:05.680
it's hard to know which part of you's
the truth.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.520
And that's the burden.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.840
It's your call.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.549
Better hit the road.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.320

- No.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.517
Nah, you got people here?
No. I don't think so.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.000

AKASH: Piss off. Go on. You better run.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.080
Are you buddy-buddy with them?
I'm just trying to find my brother.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.879
Yeah? Who's your brother?

31:48.440 --> 31:49.590
You don't know him. Raza.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.600
I've seen him, yeah.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.680
Raza's my homie.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.596
Bro, he's a total legend.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.756
That's nice. You take photos with it?

32:03.160 --> 32:04.753
Yeah. That's what you do with a camera.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.869
I got a pro camera at home.

32:07.640 --> 32:08.640
Telephoto.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.440
It stores like a thousand gigs.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.795
A thousand gigs?
Bruv, does that even exist.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.239
How many gigs does that store then, bro?

32:21.200 --> 32:23.317
Not even one. Think about that.

32:24.680 --> 32:25.875
OO. I'm gonna go home.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.232
Come on, bro. They don't mess with me.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.675
Do you like cars?
Yeah. Depends which one.
