02:22.340 --> 02:23.341
So this is it.

02:24.273 --> 02:26.107
Hold it there!

03:18.574 --> 03:20.206
Come out
with your hands up!

03:21.573 --> 03:22.973
Come out with your hands up!

03:23.007 --> 03:26.240
- What the...
- Don't. They're not here for you.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.140
They have no right to be here.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.874
Oye! What do
you lot think you're...

03:44.473 --> 03:46.107
Got you, got you.

03:47.506 --> 03:49.540
Come out
with your hands up!

03:52.407 --> 03:53.808
You save yourself, mate.

03:56.339 --> 03:58.007
No, I'm gonna get you
out of here.

03:58.039 --> 03:59.874
No, just go.

04:01.273 --> 04:05.775
Please! Before... Before...

04:08.040 --> 04:09.107
Stay.

04:09.140 --> 04:10.775
Put your hands up!

05:03.272 --> 05:05.373
What the...

05:05.406 --> 05:08.206
Good, you're awake.

05:10.272 --> 05:11.874
Who the hell are you?

05:12.873 --> 05:14.107
What do you mean?

05:16.540 --> 05:18.374
Where am I?

05:18.406 --> 05:20.240
Don't you remember?

05:22.005 --> 05:23.006
No.

05:24.973 --> 05:27.341
Oh... None of it?

05:29.240 --> 05:30.207
I'm sorry. I...

05:30.240 --> 05:32.774
I have no idea who you are
or how I got here.

05:34.173 --> 05:35.407
I'm Alana.

05:36.539 --> 05:38.174
What's the last
thing you remember?

05:40.506 --> 05:41.774
I, uh...

05:42.607 --> 05:44.007
I was in hospital.

05:45.006 --> 05:46.007
That was a week ago.

05:48.106 --> 05:49.807
- A week?
- Yeah.

05:51.539 --> 05:53.173
We launched this morning.

06:08.307 --> 06:09.474
Magnets.

06:22.406 --> 06:23.406
Hello?

06:26.039 --> 06:27.808
There's no one out there.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.141
Hello!

06:32.872 --> 06:34.039
I told you.

06:35.139 --> 06:36.473
What is this?

06:38.340 --> 06:39.907
You must remember
being sentenced.

06:40.439 --> 06:41.573
Sentenced?

06:41.606 --> 06:43.107
What are you talking about?

06:43.140 --> 06:44.441
The court sentencing.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.841
None of this makes any sense.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.107
Hey...

06:59.607 --> 07:01.107
Does this control the door?

07:02.340 --> 07:04.340
You're not making any sense.

07:04.372 --> 07:05.973
It's not gonna let you out.

07:17.339 --> 07:19.039
That's new.

07:19.073 --> 07:20.307
It didn't do that for me.

07:25.540 --> 07:26.539
What the...

07:26.573 --> 07:29.541
<i>Hello, Issac. My name is Eva.</i>

07:29.573 --> 07:31.240
<i>I'm your emergency assistant.</i>

07:32.040 --> 07:33.107
You're a computer?

07:33.473 --> 07:35.006
<i>Yes.</i>

07:35.040 --> 07:36.207
You said emergency?

07:36.239 --> 07:37.240
<i>Yes.</i>

07:39.574 --> 07:41.107
Where are we?

07:41.140 --> 07:43.474
<i>You are aboard
your habitation capsule</i>

07:43.506 --> 07:45.873
<i>approximately 150 miles</i>

07:45.906 --> 07:47.974
<i>above the surface of the Earth.</i>

07:50.472 --> 07:52.040
- Space?
- <i>Yes.</i>

08:10.540 --> 08:12.174
I, uh...

08:12.207 --> 08:15.274
There... There... There...
There must be some mistake.

08:15.306 --> 08:18.907
They... They must have
confused me with someone else.

08:18.940 --> 08:20.406
<i>Are you not
Issac Havelock?</i>

08:20.440 --> 08:21.741
I am, but I...

08:21.773 --> 08:24.207
<i>You were selected to be
part of the Samsara program,</i>

08:24.239 --> 08:25.173
<i>which aims to build</i>

08:25.207 --> 08:27.940
<i>Earth's first colony
by the year 2052.</i>

08:29.574 --> 08:31.307
- <i>The mission is due to depart...</i>
- What?

08:31.339 --> 08:33.173
<i>...from Earth's orbit
in eleven hours,</i>

08:33.206 --> 08:35.839
<i>once all of the habitation
pods have docked.</i>

08:35.871 --> 08:37.139
When does docking happen?

08:37.173 --> 08:39.039
<i>We have already docked.</i>

08:39.073 --> 08:40.508
Okay, great. Um...

08:41.573 --> 08:44.306
So how do we get out of here
and talk to someone?

08:44.339 --> 08:46.274
<i>I'm sorry,
but you cannot open</i>

08:46.307 --> 08:48.140
<i>the airlock
unless the ship is docked.</i>

08:48.172 --> 08:49.541
But you just said
we were docked.

08:49.574 --> 08:51.207
So why can't we open the door?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.508
<i>We are no longer docked.</i>

08:54.172 --> 08:55.406
Why?

08:55.439 --> 08:58.474
<i>I'm sorry,
but my systems were only activated</i>

08:58.507 --> 09:00.540
<i>during the emergency
separation.</i>

09:00.573 --> 09:02.940
<i>Therefore, I am
unable to provide information</i>

09:02.973 --> 09:04.006
<i>preceding that event.</i>

09:04.040 --> 09:05.840
Emergency.
What emergency

09:05.873 --> 09:07.873
other than we're trapped
in this room?

09:07.906 --> 09:10.140
<i>An emergency occurred
aboard the ship.</i>

09:10.173 --> 09:11.806
<i>I have no further information.</i>

09:13.239 --> 09:14.339
Well, then...

09:14.372 --> 09:16.940
Then why don't I
remember any of this?

09:16.973 --> 09:18.807
<i>Atmospheric pressure
in the capsule</i>

09:18.839 --> 09:20.273
<i>dropped to 15 %.</i>

09:20.307 --> 09:22.507
<i>Mild symptoms
of hypoxia include</i>

09:22.540 --> 09:25.973
<i>temporary loss of memory,
loss of motor control</i>

09:26.005 --> 09:27.839
<i>and attentiveness,
poor judgement...</i>

09:29.573 --> 09:31.073
Do you understand any of this?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.006
I woke up just before you.

09:36.940 --> 09:37.939
So,

09:39.106 --> 09:42.007
how can we walk around
without, you know,

09:42.507 --> 09:44.039
floating?

09:44.072 --> 09:46.507
<i>Gravity is regulated
using polarized magnets</i>

09:46.540 --> 09:47.673
<i>in the floor and ceiling.</i>

09:47.706 --> 09:50.907
<i>All participants are issued
with magnetic implants.</i>

09:51.872 --> 09:54.506
Like I said, magnets.

09:54.539 --> 09:57.872
<i>Liquids are not subject
to gravity controls, however.</i>

09:59.072 --> 10:01.173
<i>But the vacuum system
creates negative airflow...</i>

10:01.206 --> 10:02.206
Why me?

10:05.839 --> 10:07.006
I don't know.

10:18.173 --> 10:19.239
What is it?

10:19.273 --> 10:20.306
Look.

10:37.005 --> 10:38.206
Oh, my God.

10:39.607 --> 10:40.807
Hey.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.040
Snap out of it.

10:55.307 --> 10:56.307
Is that...

10:56.839 --> 10:58.774
Or was that the ship?

11:00.472 --> 11:01.773
I think it was.

11:42.905 --> 11:43.973
Breathe.

11:50.005 --> 11:51.806
How are you so calm?

11:54.373 --> 11:55.540
We're still here.

11:59.906 --> 12:01.174
Eva?

12:01.206 --> 12:02.506
<i>Yes, Issac?</i>

12:02.539 --> 12:04.572
Can we communicate
with the ship?

12:04.605 --> 12:05.474
<i>Yes, Issac.</i>

12:05.507 --> 12:07.307
<i>Who would you like
to speak to you?</i>

12:09.373 --> 12:10.940
Put us through to the, uh...

12:12.472 --> 12:13.507
The bridge.

12:14.239 --> 12:15.240
Yeah.

12:16.106 --> 12:17.107
<i>Sure.</i>

12:18.506 --> 12:20.339
<i>Sorry, the call failed.</i>

12:20.373 --> 12:22.106
<i>Would you like to try
the medical bay?</i>

12:22.472 --> 12:23.473
Sure.

12:24.506 --> 12:25.540
<i>Call failed.</i>

12:25.573 --> 12:26.707
<i>Would you like to...</i>

12:26.740 --> 12:29.239
Just try every part of the ship
until you get an answer.

12:29.273 --> 12:30.273
<i>Sure.</i>

12:33.172 --> 12:35.107
<i>Sorry. All calls failed.</i>

12:38.973 --> 12:40.573
What about the ground?

12:40.606 --> 12:42.240
<i>Who would you like
to call?</i>

12:43.005 --> 12:44.273
Ground Control.

12:44.739 --> 12:46.072
<i>One moment.</i>

12:46.106 --> 12:47.907
<i>Connecting you now.</i>

12:47.940 --> 12:49.973
<i>Hello, Jane speaking.</i>

12:50.006 --> 12:51.274
Yes. Thank God!

12:51.307 --> 12:53.839
Yes, hi.
This is Issac Havelock.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.840
Um, there's been
some sort of...

12:55.872 --> 12:57.273
<i>Who would you like
to speak to?</i>

12:57.307 --> 12:58.506
Is this not Ground Control?

12:58.540 --> 13:00.972
<i>No, this is the main
switchboard, would you like me</i>

13:01.005 --> 13:03.139
<i>to put you through to
someone in the Control teams?</i>

13:03.172 --> 13:04.139
Yes!

13:04.172 --> 13:06.572
- <i>One moment.</i>
- Thank you.

13:06.605 --> 13:08.939
<i>I'm sorry,
but I can't reach anyone.</i>

13:08.973 --> 13:10.240
<i>It's really busy down there.</i>

13:10.273 --> 13:11.973
<i>Can I take a message
and pass it on</i>

13:12.005 --> 13:13.572
<i>to someone
to get you a call back?</i>

13:13.606 --> 13:15.973
What? No, we need to speak
to someone right now.

13:16.005 --> 13:18.273
This is literally
a matter of life and death.

13:18.306 --> 13:20.406
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
I can't raise them.</i>

13:20.439 --> 13:22.072
<i>Uh, one moment.</i>

13:22.105 --> 13:23.972
<i>I've got someone,
putting you through.</i>

13:24.006 --> 13:26.139
<i>Hello.
To who am I speaking?</i>

13:26.172 --> 13:28.573
Sir, this is Issac Havelock.

13:28.606 --> 13:30.106
We're on board our capsule

13:30.139 --> 13:31.506
and separated
from the main ship.

13:31.538 --> 13:34.206
<i>Issac, there's
been an explosion</i>

13:34.240 --> 13:35.907
<i>and we're not sure
what the status</i>

13:35.940 --> 13:37.341
<i>of the</i> Vega 3 <i>or its crew is.</i>

13:38.839 --> 13:40.906
<i>Hang in there.
We're doing everything we can.</i>

13:40.940 --> 13:42.074
Okay, but...

13:42.107 --> 13:43.341
<i>We can't see you
on our monitors right now.</i>

13:43.373 --> 13:46.340
<i>Can you tell me what you can
see outside of the window?</i>

14:27.905 --> 14:28.906
<i>Issac.</i>

14:29.839 --> 14:31.006
Issac.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.039
Wake up.

14:38.072 --> 14:39.073
What happened?

14:41.405 --> 14:42.807
Another explosion.

14:47.873 --> 14:50.007
Control?

14:50.371 --> 14:51.606
Gone.

14:51.639 --> 14:54.540
<i>You have used one
of your ten calls this month.</i>

14:54.573 --> 14:58.140
<i>Inbound and outbound calls
count towards your allowance.</i>

14:58.172 --> 15:01.240
<i>Calls may be monitored
by staff for violations.</i>

15:01.273 --> 15:02.439
Whatever.

15:02.471 --> 15:04.273
I'd be lucky if I last a week.

15:05.274 --> 15:08.274
<i>Impact detected.</i>

15:08.306 --> 15:09.939
What does that mean?

15:11.240 --> 15:13.872
Something just hit the ship.

15:13.906 --> 15:16.373
<i>A drop in internal pressure has been detected.</i>

15:16.406 --> 15:17.507
Calm down.

15:18.539 --> 15:20.373
We need to focus.

15:20.405 --> 15:23.073
Eva, do you know where
the leak is coming from?

15:23.473 --> 15:24.472
<i>Unknown.</i>

15:25.972 --> 15:27.973
Water flows to microgravity.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.472
<i>Atmospheric pressure
currently at 96% and falling.</i>

15:43.338 --> 15:44.372
There.

15:44.405 --> 15:45.906
Eva,
how do we fix this?

15:45.940 --> 15:48.073
<i>Minor hull damage
can be sealed using</i>

15:48.106 --> 15:51.040
<i>the emergency repair kit
located below the gardens</i>

15:51.072 --> 15:53.206
<i>and blowtorch
mounted on the wall.</i>

16:13.940 --> 16:16.540
Eva, how big an impact
can this thing take?

16:16.573 --> 16:18.907
<i>Objects smaller than
ten millimeters</i>

16:18.940 --> 16:22.007
<i>at a maximum rate
of 8,000 meters per second.</i>

16:24.973 --> 16:26.472
That looks bigger
than a centimeter.

16:29.306 --> 16:30.473
Are you okay?

16:30.506 --> 16:31.472
I'm hit.

16:31.506 --> 16:33.273
<i>A second leak
has been detected.</i>

16:33.306 --> 16:34.806
That looks a lot bigger.

16:38.405 --> 16:40.405
At least we don't have to
look for it.

16:52.005 --> 16:54.174
<i>Atmospheric
pressure has stabilized.</i>

17:14.539 --> 17:16.207
How is it?

17:16.239 --> 17:18.074
It'll be okay,
it's not too deep.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.107
Lucky.

17:22.339 --> 17:24.940
I'd like to know
what you think is unlucky.

17:24.972 --> 17:26.472
<i>Incoming call
from Control.</i>

17:28.205 --> 17:30.073
<i>Skill,
Havelock, are you there?</i>

17:30.572 --> 17:31.806
Hello.

17:32.205 --> 17:33.405
Still here.

17:33.438 --> 17:35.072
<i>Lost you for a bit there.</i>

17:35.106 --> 17:36.340
<i>I have some bad news.</i>

17:37.238 --> 17:38.239
<i>The ship is gone.</i>

17:39.505 --> 17:41.107
<i>There may be other survivors,</i>

17:41.139 --> 17:42.939
<i>but we don't know
how many right now.</i>

17:43.905 --> 17:44.806
Gone?

17:44.839 --> 17:46.439
<i>Do you know
what happened?</i>

17:46.471 --> 17:49.505
I, uh, don't know,
we must have been asleep.

17:49.539 --> 17:50.439
We still don't know.

17:50.473 --> 17:52.405
What are you doing
to get us out of here?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.405
<i>We're working on it.</i>

17:54.439 --> 17:56.074
<i>Don't worry.
We'll get you out.</i>

17:58.039 --> 17:59.239
Who's worrying?

18:00.305 --> 18:01.539
You are.

18:04.271 --> 18:05.772
Hello?

18:05.806 --> 18:08.206
<i>Listen, your capsule is
currently falling out of orbit.</i>

18:08.238 --> 18:10.907
<i>Without adjustment,
you'll re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.</i>

18:11.873 --> 18:12.907
That sounds good to me.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.473
<i>No, that's not good.</i>

18:14.506 --> 18:16.939
<i>We don't know if your capsule
will survive re-entry</i>

18:16.972 --> 18:19.372
<i>due to the possible damage
sustained during the explosion.</i>

18:22.439 --> 18:23.473
<i>Are you there?</i>

18:23.506 --> 18:25.973
What do you want us to do?

18:26.006 --> 18:28.872
<i>Stand by for instructions.
We're working on it.</i>

18:28.906 --> 18:32.073
So you said.

18:32.106 --> 18:34.339
<i>In the meantime,
try to conserve your air.</i>

18:34.372 --> 18:36.806
<i>Don't breathe
too deeply or quickly.</i>

18:36.840 --> 18:37.840
<i>Try not to panic.</i>

18:38.438 --> 18:40.107
<i>Call failed.</i>

18:40.138 --> 18:42.405
Why on earth would we panic?

18:42.439 --> 18:45.807
<i>You have used two
of your ten calls this month.</i>

18:45.840 --> 18:48.907
<i>Inbound and outbound calls
count towards your allowance.</i>

18:48.939 --> 18:51.572
<i>Calls may be monitored
by staff for violations.</i>

18:51.606 --> 18:54.939
Eva, do me a favor
and don't bring that up again.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.006
<i>Okay, Issac.</i>

19:04.139 --> 19:06.306
What aren't you telling me?

19:07.105 --> 19:08.106
Sorry?

19:10.271 --> 19:11.807
You're so calm.

19:14.538 --> 19:15.438
Why do I get the feeling

19:15.473 --> 19:17.840
there's something you know
that I don't?

19:19.338 --> 19:20.940
I don't know.

19:20.972 --> 19:23.539
Sounds more like a "you"
problem than a "me" problem.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.339
Funny.

19:29.506 --> 19:31.240
So what did you do?

19:36.238 --> 19:39.973
Someone did something to me,
so I did something to him.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.039
<i>Incoming call.</i>

20:09.072 --> 20:11.206
<i>Hello, to who am I
speaking, please?</i>

20:14.939 --> 20:17.338
Uh, this is Issac Havelock.

20:17.372 --> 20:20.007
<i>Hi, Issac.
This is KNL News.</i>

20:20.038 --> 20:21.073
<i>Are you okay?</i>

20:21.105 --> 20:23.472
<i>We've heard there's been
an explosion up there.</i>

20:23.505 --> 20:26.006
Uh, yeah.
We're, we're fine.

20:26.606 --> 20:28.273
How did you get through?

20:28.306 --> 20:29.573
<i>We have our sources.</i>

20:29.605 --> 20:31.907
<i>Oh, good, Issac.
We're glad to hear that.</i>

20:31.939 --> 20:34.138
<i>Um, my name's Lucy James.
I'm a researcher with KNL.</i>

20:34.172 --> 20:36.139
<i>Would you mind
speaking to us on air?</i>

20:36.172 --> 20:38.573
- No.
- Um, not really.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.939
<i>Great! I'm patching
you through right now.</i>

20:41.305 --> 20:42.340
But I...

20:42.372 --> 20:45.939
<i>Issac, uh, this is
Ken Bradley with KNL News.</i>

20:45.973 --> 20:47.472
<i>You're live on the air.</i>

20:49.605 --> 20:50.672
Hi, Ken.

20:50.706 --> 20:53.106
<i>It's really great
to hear your voice.</i>

20:53.138 --> 20:56.005
<i>Um, now, you're the first person
we've heard from up there.</i>

20:56.039 --> 20:57.507
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

20:59.905 --> 21:00.906
<i>Issac?</i>

21:02.104 --> 21:03.405
- Hey!
- <i>Hello, Issac.</i>

21:03.438 --> 21:04.439
Come on.

21:06.205 --> 21:08.373
Uh, yeah. Still, still here.

21:08.405 --> 21:10.939
<i>Oh, good, good.
Yes, we've got you back.</i>

21:10.973 --> 21:12.840
<i>You were going to
tell us what happened.</i>

21:14.239 --> 21:15.907
Um, I was asleep.

21:17.538 --> 21:20.005
And then I woke up and
something was hitting the ship.

21:22.872 --> 21:26.405
And then there was
a large explosion outside.

21:26.439 --> 21:29.206
<i>My gosh, that sounds
very serious indeed.</i>

21:29.238 --> 21:30.305
<i>Um, and do you know</i>

21:30.339 --> 21:32.339
<i>what the condition of
the rest of the crew is?</i>

21:32.371 --> 21:34.205
I'm afraid I have no idea.

21:34.239 --> 21:36.972
<i>Well, it,
that must be very difficult.</i>

21:37.005 --> 21:40.273
<i>Well, our thoughts
are with you right now.</i>

21:40.305 --> 21:42.205
<i>You are incredibly brave.</i>

21:42.239 --> 21:45.273
<i>Do you mind telling us how you
deal with the psychological toll</i>

21:45.306 --> 21:48.573
<i>and the huge risks involved in
the long-distance space flight?</i>

21:48.605 --> 21:51.305
I honestly don't know
how to answer that right now.

21:51.339 --> 21:53.071
<i>I understand.</i>

21:53.105 --> 21:55.206
<i>What is the plan
for your recovery now?</i>

21:56.238 --> 21:58.238
You know
as much as I do.

21:58.272 --> 22:00.306
Control are trying
to figure out what happened

22:00.339 --> 22:02.373
and we hope to get an update
from them soon.

22:02.405 --> 22:05.072
<i>Well, in that case we
will, um, we will leave it there</i>

22:05.104 --> 22:09.339
<i>and, um, won't keep you. Thank you.
Uh, speak soon and good luck.</i>

22:09.371 --> 22:10.840
<i>Call terminated.</i>

22:21.371 --> 22:22.839
That was a huge mistake.

22:24.471 --> 22:26.372
I remember everything.

22:29.539 --> 22:30.972
Do you?

22:33.372 --> 22:35.106
I didn't mean to do it.

22:39.606 --> 22:41.106
Do what?

22:44.271 --> 22:46.905
Shot a man.

22:46.938 --> 22:49.506
Didn't mean to kill him,
but he died.

22:55.139 --> 22:56.473
Heard that one before.

22:58.871 --> 23:00.472
What do you mean?

23:03.405 --> 23:06.572
You just don't want to take
responsibility for your actions

23:06.605 --> 23:08.972
'cause you're scared how others
would perceive you.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.938
No, I really didn't mean to.

23:14.272 --> 23:16.340
Doesn't make you a bad person.

23:17.305 --> 23:20.039
Trust me... I'd know.

23:21.038 --> 23:23.539
All right. What?

23:25.171 --> 23:27.972
Why do you think I'm here?

23:28.004 --> 23:30.807
We're all just
criminals to them.

23:34.272 --> 23:36.306
It doesn't make any sense,
if we're criminals

23:36.339 --> 23:39.472
and they normally separate men and
women, why would they put us together?

23:54.272 --> 23:56.406
Isn't it obvious?

24:01.971 --> 24:03.971
Well,

24:04.004 --> 24:06.506
that's not happening.

24:09.338 --> 24:11.440
Don't you find me attractive?

24:12.573 --> 24:15.039
No, I think you're
very attractive.

24:17.172 --> 24:19.140
I'm just with someone.

24:22.104 --> 24:23.372
Really?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.506
Mm-hmm.

24:27.372 --> 24:29.340
Take a look around Issac,

24:30.338 --> 24:32.838
you might change your mind.

24:51.371 --> 24:53.305
Don't worry,

24:53.339 --> 24:54.905
I'm only messing with you.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.838
You gonna tell me
what you did?

25:12.371 --> 25:14.106
Maybe later.

26:03.272 --> 26:07.871
So, Chris, what are
the latest developments?

26:07.905 --> 26:10.106
Uh, well, not much right now.

26:10.138 --> 26:13.239
Uh, all we've got is an official
statement, saying there's been an incident

26:13.271 --> 26:15.071
and that they're working
on what's happened

26:15.104 --> 26:17.038
and what the status
of the crew is.

26:17.072 --> 26:19.406
Well, um, we will
keep and eye out for that.

26:20.105 --> 26:22.039
Now, um,

26:22.071 --> 26:24.105
if you had've told me
ten years ago

26:24.139 --> 26:27.939
that we would be sending prisoners into
space, I would have called you mad.

26:27.972 --> 26:30.106
Um, what do you think about it?

26:30.138 --> 26:33.472
Um, does it prove,
it was a... a bad idea?

26:33.506 --> 26:36.173
Well, this is what's
being unsaid.

26:36.206 --> 26:39.440
How we treat our prisoners reflects
on how we're doing as a society.

26:40.572 --> 26:42.806
And our prisons are full,

26:42.838 --> 26:44.373
conditions are terrible,

26:44.405 --> 26:46.971
and that's because,
if we look at the bigger picture,

26:47.005 --> 26:50.071
global, um, population
has exploded,

26:50.105 --> 26:51.839
and the climate is a disaster,

26:51.872 --> 26:54.139
and Earth is in
the state of upheaval.

26:54.171 --> 26:58.005
We need to colonize
other planets to survive.

26:58.039 --> 27:01.206
So in that sense, don't you think
this gives meaning to prisoners' lives

27:01.239 --> 27:04.072
that would otherwise
be spent in a cramped cell?

27:04.104 --> 27:06.472
It's an important,
noble cause.

27:06.505 --> 27:08.071
So this program
is very important.

27:08.105 --> 27:10.439
Yes, but these people
didn't choose to.

27:10.472 --> 27:13.340
It's just so incredibly risky as
demonstrated by what has gone wrong.

27:13.639 --> 27:15.106
I mean,

27:15.139 --> 27:17.306
if how we treat our prisoners

27:17.339 --> 27:19.205
reflects how
compassionate we are,

27:19.239 --> 27:21.072
well, doesn't this
reflect badly?

27:21.105 --> 27:22.573
There are
stacks of people

27:22.605 --> 27:25.573
who'd give their right arm
to go into space.

27:25.604 --> 27:27.938
This is an opportunity
to die for.

27:27.972 --> 27:30.939
Yes, well, I'm... You almost
have me convinced there.

27:30.971 --> 27:33.105
Um, but ask yourself this.

27:33.737 --> 27:36.005
Why was it done in secret?

27:36.039 --> 27:38.006
Why wasn't it done by consent?

27:38.039 --> 27:39.439
And why are we only
find out now

27:39.472 --> 27:42.139
something has gone
terribly wrong?

27:42.171 --> 27:44.539
Well, the Ministry of Justice
told us this morning

27:44.573 --> 27:47.005
that they specifically
selected prisoners

27:47.039 --> 27:50.139
who are
assessed to be, um,

27:50.172 --> 27:53.006
"psychologically suitable"
for the mission.

27:53.038 --> 27:56.971
And, the justice system was the
ideal way to assess many applicants

27:57.004 --> 27:59.971
with the prerequisite
personal situation.

28:00.005 --> 28:02.139
By that, I suppose
they mean no ties.

28:02.171 --> 28:03.872
All right, I hear you.

28:05.071 --> 28:07.338
And now
for a quick news update.

28:07.371 --> 28:09.472
Billionaire Inventor,
Robert Themis

28:09.506 --> 28:11.238
and his company Hyperion,

28:11.271 --> 28:12.905
have offered
the company's help

28:12.938 --> 28:14.906
in rescuing the stranded crew.

28:16.605 --> 28:19.173
Mr. Themis, Mr. Themis,
you said in your post

28:19.205 --> 28:20.539
that your company wants to help

28:20.572 --> 28:21.906
and that you're ready to go.

28:21.939 --> 28:23.372
What did you
mean by that, exactly?

28:23.406 --> 28:25.173
Yeah, uh, we've actually
been developing

28:25.205 --> 28:26.239
some escape pods

28:26.271 --> 28:28.405
for this exact situation
for NASA

28:28.439 --> 28:31.139
and we've got an unmanned
capsule ready for launch.

28:31.171 --> 28:32.839
We can get up there,
get a pilot,

28:32.871 --> 28:34.571
and bring this crew
safely back to Earth.

28:34.605 --> 28:36.406
Okay, and presumably,
you got enough

28:36.438 --> 28:37.871
for each of the survivors?

28:37.904 --> 28:39.538
Well, actually
it can hold two, but, uh,

28:39.572 --> 28:41.839
we can only dock
one craft per flight.

28:41.871 --> 28:44.071
So we need to do runs,
which could take many days,

28:44.105 --> 28:46.273
or we could get several
going at once.

28:46.306 --> 28:47.971
How many do you have exactly?

28:48.005 --> 28:49.373
We've got several, yeah.

28:49.405 --> 28:51.971
Well, some people
out there, they must all be

28:52.005 --> 28:53.871
just saying this is
another publicity stunt.

28:53.905 --> 28:54.939
Um, is it?

28:55.538 --> 28:57.905
No. Thanks for your time.

29:15.338 --> 29:17.405
<i>Sorry, but you've
used up your 30 minutes</i>

29:17.439 --> 29:19.473
<i>of television viewing
for today.</i>

29:19.505 --> 29:21.473
<i>Too much television
is bad for your health.</i>

29:23.138 --> 29:25.205
Who cares
about the news anyway?

29:25.239 --> 29:27.439
Money, death, the environment,

29:27.471 --> 29:29.038
blah, blah, blah.

29:29.072 --> 29:31.539
<i>Incoming call.</i>

29:31.571 --> 29:33.806
<i>Skill, Havelock,
it's Control.</i>

29:34.205 --> 29:35.505
Finally!

29:36.339 --> 29:38.172
<i>Havelock,
what was that?</i>

29:39.139 --> 29:40.439
Sorry, what?

29:41.272 --> 29:43.138
Told you.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.839
<i>Why did you
talk to the media?</i>

29:44.872 --> 29:47.238
<i>That was very insensitive
and ill advised.</i>

29:47.271 --> 29:49.372
You're kidding, right?

29:49.406 --> 29:51.406
We're trapped here
in this box about to die,

29:51.438 --> 29:54.504
and you're having a go at me
about talking to the media?

29:54.538 --> 29:57.072
<i>We're trying to
figure out what has happened.</i>

29:57.104 --> 29:58.538
<i>This is a live situation
and we...</i>

29:58.572 --> 30:00.972
Who even are you people?

30:01.004 --> 30:02.806
Is it all about
public perception to you?

30:02.838 --> 30:04.806
Do you give a fuck
about us at all?

30:06.904 --> 30:09.206
Are you even
listening to me?

30:12.605 --> 30:14.471
Temper, temper.

30:14.505 --> 30:16.406
<i>Issac, I'm sorry.</i>

30:16.438 --> 30:19.173
<i>We're in crisis mode here
and tempers are running high.</i>

30:19.671 --> 30:21.071
<i>Let's start again.</i>

30:21.105 --> 30:22.305
<i>We need to control</i>

30:22.338 --> 30:24.173
<i>what information is in the
public domain right now</i>

30:24.205 --> 30:26.805
<i>for the sake of the families
of the crew.</i>

30:32.004 --> 30:34.172
Okay, sir, I get it.

30:34.205 --> 30:35.838
<i>Thanks, Issac.</i>

30:39.871 --> 30:42.272
So, what do we do now?

30:42.306 --> 30:44.306
<i>The reason
I called you actually was</i>

30:44.338 --> 30:47.172
<i>that it's critical we put
you back into a stable orbit.</i>

30:47.206 --> 30:50.138
<i>Not just for your sake,
but for people on the ground.</i>

30:50.172 --> 30:52.972
<i>That thing most likely won't
break up in the atmosphere.</i>

30:53.005 --> 30:54.105
<i>In fact, it's designed</i>

30:54.139 --> 30:57.173
<i>for re-entry in an emergency
and has parachutes.</i>

30:57.206 --> 30:59.939
<i>But we don't know what the
state of your heat shields are</i>

30:59.972 --> 31:01.006
<i>after the explosion.</i>

31:01.039 --> 31:02.006
<i>And in any case,</i>

31:02.038 --> 31:04.572
<i>the re-entry angle
needs to be controlled.</i>

31:04.604 --> 31:06.273
Okay, what do we need to do?

31:06.305 --> 31:08.339
<i>Okay,
listen carefully.</i>

31:08.371 --> 31:09.504
<i>I'm going to talk you through</i>

31:09.538 --> 31:12.306
<i>how to manually pilot
the capsule back into orbit.</i>

31:13.372 --> 31:14.372
We're listening.

31:14.404 --> 31:16.404
<i>Good. Do you see
the control panel?</i>

31:19.437 --> 31:20.838
- Yes.
- <i>Good.</i>

31:20.872 --> 31:22.339
<i>Go to it, wake it up.</i>

31:22.371 --> 31:24.006
<i>Navigate to "systems".</i>

31:26.538 --> 31:27.906
Yeah.

31:27.938 --> 31:29.071
<i>"Advanced."</i>

31:29.105 --> 31:30.338
Yeah.

31:30.371 --> 31:31.506
<i>"Thrust control."</i>

31:32.904 --> 31:34.038
<i>"Manual override."</i>

31:34.438 --> 31:35.571
Okay.

31:35.604 --> 31:37.971
<i>You need to enter
the following code,</i>

31:38.004 --> 31:39.338
<i>Victor, Charlie,</i>

31:39.370 --> 31:40.938
<i>Yankee, Delta,</i>

31:40.971 --> 31:42.272
<i>One Niner.</i>

31:42.772 --> 31:43.905
Okay, done.

31:43.939 --> 31:46.173
<i>Now you need to open
"thrust vectoring"</i>

31:46.206 --> 31:48.039
<i>and type in
the following commands.</i>

31:48.071 --> 31:50.938
<i>Under "altitude", enter,
negative 11.</i>

31:50.971 --> 31:53.371
<i>Under "seconds", enter, four.</i>

31:53.404 --> 31:55.338
<i>Under "power", enter, 80%.</i>

31:57.838 --> 31:58.939
Got it.

31:58.972 --> 32:01.404
<i>Okay, stand by
to burn in ten seconds.</i>

32:01.438 --> 32:04.972
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

32:05.004 --> 32:07.806
<i>seven, six, five...</i>

32:07.838 --> 32:08.971
Okay.

32:09.004 --> 32:11.838
Four, three, two, one.

32:28.438 --> 32:29.539
<i>Incoming call.</i>

32:31.272 --> 32:32.372
<i>Havelock, Skill!</i>

32:34.071 --> 32:35.338
Yeah?

32:35.371 --> 32:37.172
<i>I see the burn went
well, which is great.</i>

32:37.205 --> 32:38.106
<i>Well done!</i>

32:38.140 --> 32:39.706
<i>Sorry we lost comms
there for a bit,</i>

32:39.738 --> 32:43.005
<i>but you did a great job. And you're
in a good spot for the time being.</i>

32:43.905 --> 32:45.006
Thanks.

32:45.039 --> 32:46.240
<i>How you holding up?</i>

32:48.172 --> 32:49.239
<i>Guys, can you hear me?</i>

32:50.872 --> 32:52.005
We can hear you,

32:52.038 --> 32:53.571
just don't know
what to tell you.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.539
<i>I get it,
must be hard.</i>

32:55.571 --> 32:58.404
<i>Don't worry, we're doing
everything we can.</i>

32:58.438 --> 33:00.072
<i>The room is hectic
at the moment.</i>

33:00.104 --> 33:01.906
<i>We've got
the night shift in to help,</i>

33:01.938 --> 33:03.972
<i>so double the amount
of people than normal,</i>

33:04.004 --> 33:06.806
<i>and we've got people here
from NASA and the military.</i>

33:06.838 --> 33:10.072
<i>The greatest minds in the country are
working on how to get you back safe.</i>

33:10.104 --> 33:11.404
But what exactly
is the problem?

33:11.437 --> 33:13.304
Why can't we just
turn this thing around,

33:13.338 --> 33:16.572
pull the parachute,
and you pick us up from the ocean?

33:16.605 --> 33:20.272
<i>Right now, we can't risk
anything until we know everything.</i>

33:20.304 --> 33:22.371
<i>I'm not a propulsion expert
or an engineer,</i>

33:22.405 --> 33:25.173
<i>I'm just a medic and your
welfare is my priority.</i>

33:27.105 --> 33:29.072
Sorry, you're a medic?

33:29.104 --> 33:30.505
What is it you specialize in?

33:30.537 --> 33:32.038
<i>Psychology, actually.</i>

33:32.071 --> 33:33.338
<i>but I have a general
medical training,</i>

33:33.370 --> 33:34.571
<i>applicable to space flight.</i>

33:35.672 --> 33:37.805
<i>Let's change
the subject, shall we?</i>

33:37.838 --> 33:40.172
<i>Either of you have anyone
significant back home?</i>

33:40.205 --> 33:41.872
<i>A girlfriend
or a boyfriend perhaps?</i>

33:43.039 --> 33:44.571
- No.
- Not anymore.

33:44.604 --> 33:46.005
<i>Kids?</i>

33:46.039 --> 33:48.438
- No.
- No.

33:48.471 --> 33:50.339
- <i>Close friends, then?</i>
- Not really.

33:51.271 --> 33:53.172
- No.
- <i>Family?</i>

33:53.206 --> 33:55.973
Look, what is this exactly?
Are you evaluating us?

33:56.706 --> 33:57.839
<i>Issac, I'm just...</i>

33:57.872 --> 34:00.805
Do you have a girlfriend-slash
boyfriend-slash-family?

34:00.838 --> 34:02.271
<i>Well, actually,
not really.</i>

34:02.305 --> 34:03.472
Not really?

34:03.505 --> 34:04.939
<i>No.</i>

34:04.971 --> 34:06.205
Don't you have a family?

34:07.071 --> 34:08.172
<i>Yes.</i>

34:08.205 --> 34:10.039
Are you reading this off
a piece of paper?

34:11.304 --> 34:12.338
<i>Sorry.</i>

34:13.469 --> 34:15.071
<i>Favor to ask.</i>

34:15.105 --> 34:16.737
What?

34:16.771 --> 34:19.571
<i>You able to tell me anything
more about what happened up there?</i>

34:19.605 --> 34:21.871
No, look, we've
been through this.

34:21.904 --> 34:24.271
This isn't going to help us at all.
What we need to know

34:24.304 --> 34:26.538
is what you're doing
to get us out of here.

34:26.571 --> 34:29.571
That's going to help us. Not going
around in a loop on the same thing.

34:29.603 --> 34:31.271
<i>I know,
we're working on it.</i>

34:31.304 --> 34:32.539
<i>The whole control room is.</i>

34:32.572 --> 34:34.371
<i>But this might help things.</i>

34:34.405 --> 34:37.906
<i>What happened up there?
One of you must know something.</i>

34:37.938 --> 34:39.205
We were sedated.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.038
What?

34:42.072 --> 34:43.272
<i>Who woke up first?</i>

34:44.471 --> 34:45.938
Issac work up first.

34:45.972 --> 34:47.871
Wait. No, you woke up first.

34:47.905 --> 34:49.338
And what are we talking
about, sedated?

34:49.370 --> 34:52.438
I though we were just
oxygen-deprived or something.

34:52.471 --> 34:54.371
<i>Everyone is sedated
during lift off</i>

34:54.405 --> 34:56.106
<i>until they dock
with the main ship.</i>

34:56.138 --> 34:57.339
<i>Keeps stress levels down.</i>

35:01.039 --> 35:02.339
Hello?

35:02.372 --> 35:04.471
<i>I've just been told
the capsule is about to pass</i>

35:04.504 --> 35:06.304
<i>behind the Earth.</i>

35:06.337 --> 35:08.237
Great!

35:08.270 --> 35:09.938
<i>Power levels
on board are low.</i>

35:09.972 --> 35:11.805
<i>They're recharged
by solar panel</i>

35:11.839 --> 35:14.139
<i>and you'll be in the shadow of the
Earth, for 45 minutes.</i>

35:14.539 --> 35:16.939
Meaning?

35:16.972 --> 35:19.172
<i>We may lose
radio contact for a while.</i>

35:20.437 --> 35:21.806
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

35:22.939 --> 35:24.138
<i>Bye.</i>

35:24.170 --> 35:25.539
<i>Call terminated.</i>

35:53.005 --> 35:54.405
Why did you lie to them?

36:01.004 --> 36:02.072
I didn't.

36:02.939 --> 36:04.272
You woke up first.

36:10.438 --> 36:11.806
But that's not true.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.172
Yeah, it is.

36:18.171 --> 36:21.773
<i>Warning! Power levels
at 9% and falling.</i>

36:27.205 --> 36:29.372
What happens
if we lose power?

36:29.404 --> 36:32.038
<i>Lighting, heating,
voice assist,</i>

36:32.070 --> 36:34.805
<i>communications and propulsion
will be unavailable.</i>

36:34.838 --> 36:38.438
<i>Mag-Grav and life-support systems
will switch to auxiliary power.</i>

36:39.871 --> 36:41.338
Is there anything
we can do about it?

36:41.671 --> 36:43.005
<i>No.</i>

36:43.537 --> 36:44.906
Then I'm going to sleep.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.238
Eva, turn off the lights.

36:49.270 --> 36:51.005
<i>Sure, Issac.</i>

38:57.604 --> 39:00.404
<i>Incoming call
from Control.</i>

39:00.438 --> 39:02.872
<i>Skill, Havelock.
Can you hear us?</i>

39:11.405 --> 39:13.506
<i>Guys,
we're standing by to hear from you.</i>

39:20.903 --> 39:23.772
<i>Alana, Issac.
Can you hear us?</i>

39:34.839 --> 39:36.905
<i>Guys, are you there?</i>

39:39.604 --> 39:40.971
<i>Guys.</i>

39:45.371 --> 39:48.205
<i>Pod 471,
please wake occupants</i>

39:50.238 --> 39:52.238
<i>Issac?</i>

39:52.270 --> 39:53.805
<i>Alana?</i>

39:54.504 --> 39:56.004
<i>Control is calling.</i>

39:59.903 --> 40:01.238
<i>Can you hear us?</i>

40:05.870 --> 40:06.938
Yup.

40:08.071 --> 40:09.505
Still here apparently.

40:09.538 --> 40:11.904
<i>We thought
we'd lost you there for a bit</i>

40:13.137 --> 40:15.304
It's so cold.

40:15.338 --> 40:17.871
<i>We think there may
be a power fault on board,</i>

40:17.904 --> 40:20.371
<i>because those batteries should
have lasted the dark period.</i>

40:21.638 --> 40:24.338
<i>They should recharge now
that you're in the sunlight,</i>

40:24.370 --> 40:26.539
<i>but you've got another one
coming up in 40 minutes,</i>

40:26.571 --> 40:29.005
<i>so we should expect it
to happen again.</i>

40:29.038 --> 40:31.505
I just want to go home.

40:31.537 --> 40:34.172
Have you got a plan
to get me out yet?

40:34.205 --> 40:35.971
<i>We're working
on it, Issac.</i>

40:36.003 --> 40:37.971
Come on, it's been hours.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.270
You must have a plan by now.

40:39.305 --> 40:42.204
<i>We're close, Issac,
just finishing up the details.</i>

40:42.238 --> 40:44.004
<i>I'll be back to you shortly.</i>

40:44.037 --> 40:45.538
<i>Call terminated.</i>

40:52.605 --> 40:54.172
Alana.

40:55.971 --> 40:56.971
What?

40:58.038 --> 40:59.138
You're awake?

40:59.171 --> 41:00.204
I never slept.

41:21.237 --> 41:22.238
<i>Incoming call.</i>

41:22.271 --> 41:24.571
<i>Issac, hello.
It's KNL News again.</i>

41:24.604 --> 41:26.337
Sorry, I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

41:26.370 --> 41:27.870
<i>Well, of course
you aren't.</i>

41:27.904 --> 41:29.038
<i>And why might that be, Issac?</i>

41:29.070 --> 41:31.538
Because those are the
instructions that Control gave me

41:31.572 --> 41:34.505
to be fair to the families
of the crew onboard this ship.

41:34.538 --> 41:37.038
<i>Hmm... You were in the
Army, weren't you, Issac?</i>

41:37.071 --> 41:39.572
I... Don't want to
talk about that.

41:39.605 --> 41:41.870
<i>I wouldn't either
if I were in your shoes.</i>

41:41.903 --> 41:43.471
<i>But unfortunately,
the truth is out.</i>

41:43.505 --> 41:46.305
<i>Would you like to tell the
ladies and gentlemen listening</i>

41:46.337 --> 41:48.838
<i>what you did
before you joined the mission?</i>

41:48.871 --> 41:50.404
Not really.
My private life is private.

41:50.438 --> 41:51.738
<i>Well, I'm afraid it isn't.</i>

41:51.770 --> 41:55.204
<i>Not when it's funded by the public
person, respectfully.</i>

41:55.238 --> 41:58.472
<i>Do you deny you killed a man
after leaving the military?</i>

41:58.505 --> 42:02.037
- Where did you get that from?
- <i>Just answer the question please, Mr. Havelock.</i>

42:02.071 --> 42:05.372
<i>Did you or did you not
kill a man?</i>

42:09.070 --> 42:11.937
- I shot a man, yes. But I...
- <i>Right. Good.</i>

42:11.971 --> 42:14.105
<i>So now,
we're getting somewhere.</i>

42:14.137 --> 42:17.437
<i>So, how can we trust you when you've
committed such a serious offence?</i>

42:17.471 --> 42:20.172
Well, luckily, you're not up here.
So you don't need to worry.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.970
<i>You can
be flippant, Mr. Havelock,</i>

42:22.004 --> 42:23.438
<i>but it won't help your case</i>

42:23.471 --> 42:24.871
<i>in the court
of public opinion.</i>

42:24.903 --> 42:28.304
<i>You killed a man and you don't
seem particularly contritious.</i>

42:28.337 --> 42:30.538
<i>The public will want
to know why.</i>

42:30.572 --> 42:32.505
<i>Why should you be saved?</i>

42:32.538 --> 42:34.405
Don't you think
the real question is

42:34.438 --> 42:37.471
is it right to send people on a
one-way journey against their will?

42:37.504 --> 42:40.504
- We got rid of the death penalty years ago.
- <i>No.</i>

42:40.537 --> 42:42.070
<i>No, I don't actually.</i>

42:42.104 --> 42:44.138
<i>I think the question is,</i>

42:44.171 --> 42:48.105
<i>given that yours is the only surviving
capsule we're aware of right now,</i>

42:48.138 --> 42:51.971
<i>and you clearly had a motive,
and have killed before,</i>

42:52.003 --> 42:55.037
<i>did you have something to do
with the explosion</i>

42:55.071 --> 42:57.438
<i>that has claimed the lives
of so many people?</i>

42:57.471 --> 42:59.505
How dare you?

42:59.538 --> 43:02.305
We're stuck up here with a slim
chance of making it out alive

43:02.337 --> 43:06.272
and you're sat there, making up rumors about
how I might have murdered all of those people?

43:06.304 --> 43:08.937
What kind of
sick person are you?

43:08.970 --> 43:12.471
<i>Yes, well, I'm sorry, Mr. Havelock,
that's our view. Best of luck to you, anyway.</i>

43:12.505 --> 43:15.471
<i>Time to take some calls
from you, um, now. Kevin!</i>

43:16.070 --> 43:18.138
<i>Call terminated.</i>

43:21.837 --> 43:23.239
What did you expect?

43:29.704 --> 43:31.139
I can kinda see it, actually.

43:31.537 --> 43:32.904
What?

43:33.903 --> 43:35.506
You, killing someone.

43:37.138 --> 43:38.372
I'm nothing like you.

43:40.903 --> 43:42.938
Of course you are.

43:42.970 --> 43:45.338
We're the same, you and I.
Why do you think you're here?

43:45.371 --> 43:46.404
Shut up!

43:51.071 --> 43:52.506
You going to make me?

43:59.170 --> 44:00.937
So, you're ex-Army,
are you?

44:00.970 --> 44:02.205
Don't talk to me right now.

44:09.337 --> 44:10.505
I'm interested.

44:14.238 --> 44:15.239
Really?

44:17.505 --> 44:18.905
So, what happened?

44:25.603 --> 44:27.405
Clara had a gambling problem.

44:29.270 --> 44:30.904
Clara, your bae?

44:36.437 --> 44:38.804
She was borrowing money off
this guy I used to work with.

44:40.538 --> 44:41.838
Ex-forces.

44:45.138 --> 44:47.772
Not someone you wanna mess
about with. He had a reputation.

44:50.237 --> 44:53.505
He was threatening her for the money,
so I sent her away to let it blow over.

44:57.538 --> 45:00.138
And I had to agree to work
for him to pay off her debt.

45:03.437 --> 45:06.072
Mostly having me
to rough up his punters.

45:08.170 --> 45:09.937
I knew he was never
gonna let us off the hook,

45:09.970 --> 45:12.837
so, one day I told him, "That's it.
I'm done. Piss off!"

45:15.304 --> 45:16.871
And it all went quiet
for a while.

45:20.237 --> 45:22.004
Didn't stay that way
for long, though.

45:51.038 --> 45:52.472
You know why I'm here.

45:52.503 --> 45:53.972
You know what you got to do.

45:54.570 --> 45:56.970
I can't do it.

45:57.003 --> 45:59.371
I'll pay him the money.
I told him I'll pay the money.

46:00.870 --> 46:02.438
It's too late for her now.

46:05.871 --> 46:07.005
Pick it up.

46:15.304 --> 46:17.937
See, we know where
you're hiding her.

46:17.971 --> 46:20.872
So you go now.
Or she dies.

46:25.171 --> 46:26.504
Be there at three.

47:23.403 --> 47:24.504
You got it?

47:34.938 --> 47:36.005
You're shaking.

47:38.537 --> 47:39.838
Have you got the money?

47:43.138 --> 47:44.438
Yeah, I have.

47:45.337 --> 47:46.371
Have you?

47:47.170 --> 47:48.238
No.

47:52.838 --> 47:54.038
I can't let you leave.

48:06.338 --> 48:07.937
You do this for him.

48:09.571 --> 48:10.872
Not for him.

48:12.436 --> 48:14.037
I'll send you away for this.

48:15.104 --> 48:16.338
It's just a flesh wound.

48:16.370 --> 48:18.271
I've see a lot of those.
Put pressure on it.

48:19.436 --> 48:20.837
You'll be all right.

48:39.838 --> 48:41.404
<i>And the prisoner
will stand up.</i>

48:43.004 --> 48:45.571
<i>Issac Havelock.</i>

48:45.604 --> 48:50.905
You have been found guilty of
the manslaughter of Richard Adams

48:50.938 --> 48:54.105
on April 14th, 2044,

48:54.138 --> 48:56.304
in contravention
of common law.

48:58.070 --> 48:59.570
In mitigation,

48:59.603 --> 49:03.503
you have stated that you were
coerced into this robbery

49:03.537 --> 49:05.870
by a third party.

49:05.903 --> 49:08.436
During the robbery, Mr. Adams,

49:08.469 --> 49:11.336
failing to obey an instruction,

49:11.370 --> 49:13.904
took a threatening approach
to you.

49:14.937 --> 49:18.137
You then shot him
in self-defense.

49:18.170 --> 49:20.470
Do you stand by
this statement?

49:20.504 --> 49:22.436
I do, but I did not kill him.

49:22.469 --> 49:23.570
Very well.

49:23.604 --> 49:30.970
This court recognizes this was
not a premeditated crime

49:31.003 --> 49:34.470
and that you have shown
remorse, however,

49:34.504 --> 49:38.471
it does not accept
your plea of self-defense,

49:38.504 --> 49:42.004
as no weapon was found
on Mr. Adam's body.

49:42.037 --> 49:44.904
It was right there, I told you.
Someone must have moved it.

49:44.938 --> 49:47.772
Stay silent, Mr. Havelock.

49:53.037 --> 49:58.204
The court recognizes your distinguished
military service to this country,

49:58.237 --> 50:03.070
and giving due consideration
to the mitigating factors,

50:03.103 --> 50:08.837
this court finds itself able
to offer you a second chance,

50:08.871 --> 50:11.138
and you will be
sentenced accordingly.

50:12.403 --> 50:13.804
Issac Havelock,

50:13.838 --> 50:18.505
you will be taken from this court
for transportation to the colonies.

50:19.403 --> 50:21.138
There, you will serve

50:21.170 --> 50:23.337
- the duration of your sentence.
- No.

50:24.205 --> 50:25.838
- Please.
- Silence!

50:27.037 --> 50:28.238
Remove the prisoner.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.304
Are you looking for sympathy?

51:17.303 --> 51:18.337
No.

51:20.570 --> 51:21.872
Good.

51:54.404 --> 51:55.772
Personal call?

51:57.370 --> 51:59.304
Yeah, if you don't mind.

52:18.270 --> 52:20.503
<i>Hey,
it's Clara, leave a message.</i>

52:20.536 --> 52:21.771
Damn it.

52:25.503 --> 52:27.004
Hi, Clara, it's Issac.

52:29.469 --> 52:30.904
I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

52:32.437 --> 52:34.103
You probably think
I just upped and left.

52:35.370 --> 52:37.238
But I promise you,
it wasn't like that.

52:41.971 --> 52:45.238
They threatened to hurt you and I
couldn't see anything bad happen to you.

52:48.102 --> 52:50.872
Long story short, I was arrested
and sentenced to the colony.

52:57.038 --> 52:58.470
<i>Something bad happened.</i>

53:01.303 --> 53:02.904
<i>I just want to know
you're okay.</i>

53:02.938 --> 53:04.905
<i>Issac, I'm here.</i>

53:04.937 --> 53:06.138
<i>I'm fine, by the way.</i>

53:09.304 --> 53:11.570
Hey, it's great to hear
your voice.

53:11.604 --> 53:14.538
<i>I saw it all on the news.
They said you volunteered.</i>

53:16.536 --> 53:18.837
Well, that's not true.

53:18.871 --> 53:20.571
Didn't anyone wonder
how they managed to get

53:20.604 --> 53:22.571
so many volunteers
for a one-way trip?

53:22.604 --> 53:23.871
<i>They didn't?</i>

53:24.104 --> 53:25.171
No.

53:28.469 --> 53:29.938
<i>Did you kill that man?</i>

53:32.938 --> 53:34.971
Yeah, I shot him.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.204
For a bloody briefcase.

53:37.270 --> 53:38.872
But I didn't mean to kill him.

53:40.236 --> 53:41.471
<i>I wish you hadn't.</i>

53:43.570 --> 53:44.905
Me, too.

53:47.871 --> 53:49.204
But I'd do it again
if I had to.

53:50.337 --> 53:51.838
<i>What was in the case?</i>

53:53.403 --> 53:54.804
Does that matter?

53:56.103 --> 53:58.905
<i>No, no,
it doesn't matter.</i>

54:00.870 --> 54:03.938
Well, on the bright side,
if I don't make it back,

54:03.971 --> 54:06.437
at least no one else is going
to have to go through this.

54:06.470 --> 54:07.905
<i>That's not funny.</i>

54:07.938 --> 54:09.071
It was cash.

54:10.036 --> 54:11.070
For what it's worth.

54:11.738 --> 54:14.371
<i>Oh, to pay the debt?</i>

54:16.204 --> 54:17.404
Didn't you wonder?

54:18.604 --> 54:20.071
<i>But I...</i>

54:21.337 --> 54:23.404
<i>I knew it must have had
something to do you.</i>

54:28.370 --> 54:29.972
<i>I just, um...</i>

54:31.002 --> 54:32.471
<i>I feel so guilty.</i>

54:32.503 --> 54:35.837
<i>Just tell me what I can do,
I'll call someone...</i>

54:35.870 --> 54:37.571
<i>Or... I don't know.</i>

54:37.603 --> 54:38.971
Don't.

54:41.003 --> 54:42.371
I'm where I'm meant to be.

54:43.304 --> 54:44.837
<i>Please, Issac.</i>

54:45.804 --> 54:49.004
<i>Just hold on
while they figure it out.</i>

54:50.436 --> 54:51.838
Listen.

54:55.437 --> 54:58.370
- I'm really glad I met you.
- <i>Me, too.</i>

55:01.570 --> 55:03.304
<i>I'll talk to you
in a bit then, yeah?</i>

55:03.336 --> 55:04.504
Yeah, sure.

55:05.503 --> 55:06.771
Love you.

55:08.536 --> 55:09.771
<i>Bye.</i>

55:14.603 --> 55:16.137
Cute.

55:17.536 --> 55:18.905
That your bae, then?

55:32.103 --> 55:33.805
You know an awful lot about me.

55:34.570 --> 55:36.437
I know nothing about you.

55:39.570 --> 55:41.237
What do you mean?

55:41.269 --> 55:44.270
You've been lying to me
this whole time, haven't you?

55:44.303 --> 55:45.937
Is anything you told
me the truth?

55:46.571 --> 55:47.936
Were you even attacked?

55:47.969 --> 55:49.136
Yes.

55:49.169 --> 55:52.438
You're telling me they put you
out here for self-defense?

55:54.838 --> 55:56.071
Not exactly.

55:57.603 --> 55:58.871
Well, then.

56:00.470 --> 56:02.071
What are you really here for?

56:06.069 --> 56:08.070
- Do you really want to know?
- Yeah.

56:16.137 --> 56:17.371
I'm an addict.

56:19.870 --> 56:21.171
Where do addicts go?

56:31.102 --> 56:32.304
Where do you think
you're going?

56:44.837 --> 56:45.838
Don't kill me.

56:47.136 --> 56:48.271
Get out of here.

56:58.604 --> 56:59.971
All right, mate?

57:14.037 --> 57:15.204
Go on, then.

57:25.437 --> 57:27.304
That's for screwing with
my mother.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.904
Your product is shit.

57:45.269 --> 57:49.137
You killed four people because you
didn't like the drugs they were selling?

57:50.236 --> 57:52.303
You killed someone
for a briefcase.

57:52.336 --> 57:53.836
I didn't kill him!

57:54.571 --> 57:57.138
Whatever. He died.

57:58.437 --> 57:59.837
You're a soldier.

58:00.870 --> 58:02.171
You know what it feels like.

58:08.170 --> 58:11.103
Killing is my drug.

58:11.136 --> 58:14.036
It's not like anyone would miss them.
They were drug addicts.

58:14.069 --> 58:16.104
You're telling me
you enjoyed it?

58:19.969 --> 58:21.003
You didn't?

58:21.869 --> 58:22.903
No.

58:26.070 --> 58:27.337
That's the best drug.

58:28.436 --> 58:29.903
You know it is.

58:31.836 --> 58:33.170
It's the most addictive.

58:37.037 --> 58:40.171
You won't admit it
because you're scared of me.

58:40.203 --> 58:41.970
I am not scared of you.

58:43.437 --> 58:44.837
Of course you are.

58:48.937 --> 58:51.304
You can keep lying to yourself
if you want to...

58:52.969 --> 58:57.069
But I know you got a kick
out of killing those people.

58:57.102 --> 59:00.203
You're just afraid that if you admit
it to yourself, you'll become like me.

59:01.936 --> 59:03.470
Truth is, you're already
like me.

59:04.469 --> 59:06.070
We both killed.

59:06.969 --> 59:08.271
We both enjoyed it.

59:10.403 --> 59:12.270
We're the same, you and I.

59:14.936 --> 59:16.004
Whatever.

59:34.836 --> 59:36.836
<i>Incoming call
from Control.</i>

59:36.870 --> 59:38.837
<i>Skill, Havelock,
are you there?</i>

59:38.870 --> 59:40.870
Where else would we be?

59:40.903 --> 59:43.037
<i>We're nearly ready
to bring you back.</i>

59:43.069 --> 59:45.936
<i>There's just one issue.</i>

59:45.970 --> 59:49.104
<i>We know that one of you went aboard
the ship before the explosion.</i>

59:50.437 --> 59:51.703
Get off me.

59:51.736 --> 59:53.270
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- What are you doing?

59:55.003 --> 59:56.937
Please.

59:56.970 --> 59:59.504
Stop it!
Just... Just leave me alone.

01:00:00.404 --> 01:00:02.570
<i>Step away
from each other.</i>

01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:04.437
I just said
I'm nowhere near her.

01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:07.303
He did it!
He blew up the ship,

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.870
and now he's trying to kill me
to stop me from talking.

01:00:09.903 --> 01:00:11.570
She's lying,
don't listen to her.

01:00:11.603 --> 01:00:13.203
It's true.

01:00:13.237 --> 01:00:14.903
<i>Alana, are you okay?</i>

01:00:14.936 --> 01:00:17.003
- Please!
- One more word and I swear...

01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:22.237
Please! Why would you put me
in a cell with this monster?

01:00:22.269 --> 01:00:23.802
- You're the monster.
- <i>Issac.</i>

01:00:23.836 --> 01:00:26.504
<i>If Alana comes to harm, we'll be
forced to abandon the rescue attempt.</i>

01:00:26.537 --> 01:00:29.104
- <i>Is that understood?</i>
- Yes.

01:00:29.137 --> 01:00:30.337
<i>Call terminated.</i>

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.036
What did you do?

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:37.069
You just set me up.

01:00:37.102 --> 01:00:38.970
- It wasn't difficult.
- Why?

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.903
You're my ticket out of here.

01:00:42.937 --> 01:00:44.370
That's why you're still alive.

01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:47.070
You blew up the ship.

01:00:47.103 --> 01:00:49.436
It was beautiful, wasn't it?

01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:52.270
- You murdered all of those people.
- I had to.

01:00:53.603 --> 01:00:57.371
- You've killed us.
- We're not dead yet.

01:00:57.403 --> 01:01:01.003
If they think either one of us
is responsible for that,

01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:02.570
they're never going
to rescue us.

01:01:02.603 --> 01:01:05.271
- Of course they will.
- Why would they do that?

01:01:07.036 --> 01:01:09.036
To save the helpless woman,
of course.

01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:12.370
Don't you see?

01:01:12.404 --> 01:01:14.971
I've saved you from a life
of slavery in the colony.

01:01:17.902 --> 01:01:20.503
And killed the future
of humanity in the process.

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:25.170
The future of humanity?

01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:27.136
Humanity is already dead

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.537
if they think sending us up here
is the way to save it.

01:01:32.203 --> 01:01:34.870
Don't tell me you believe
that bullshit.

01:01:38.837 --> 01:01:40.937
Who are you calling?

01:01:42.969 --> 01:01:45.103
I'm Issac Havelock's cellmate.

01:01:45.137 --> 01:01:46.937
- Do you want to know what he did?
- Don't.

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:54.069
<i>You're live on KNL Radio.</i>

01:01:54.103 --> 01:01:55.136
<i>What's your name?</i>

01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:59.337
I'm Alana Skill.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:00.902
<i>What do you want to
tell us, Alana?</i>

01:02:00.935 --> 01:02:04.236
My cellmate Issac just confessed that
he was the one that blew up the ship.

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:05.569
<i>What?</i>

01:02:05.602 --> 01:02:07.536
She's lying! God!

01:02:07.569 --> 01:02:09.569
<i>Is that Issac
in the background we can hear?</i>

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:13.137
He wants the world to know
what he did.

01:02:13.169 --> 01:02:15.804
He wants the program
to be dismantled.

01:02:15.836 --> 01:02:17.437
<i>Are you
talking freely, Alana?</i>

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:20.837
<i>Alana?</i>

01:02:22.536 --> 01:02:25.070
Please! Help me.

01:02:40.936 --> 01:02:43.537
That wasn't very gentlemanly.

01:03:10.937 --> 01:03:12.770
So weak.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:16.004
That's okay.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.337
How did you do it?

01:03:21.003 --> 01:03:23.371
<i>Fire detected
in the oxygen garden.</i>

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.238
Eva... Do something.

01:03:36.304 --> 01:03:38.804
<i>Fire suppressant
CO2 depleted.</i>

01:03:50.903 --> 01:03:53.804
<i>Carbon dioxide levels
are dangerously high.</i>

01:03:53.836 --> 01:03:56.469
<i>Oxygen level has fallen
to 17%.</i>

01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:04.503
I don't feel so good.

01:04:04.535 --> 01:04:07.469
<i>You may be suffering the
effects of oxygen deprivation.</i>

01:04:16.303 --> 01:04:18.503
So, this is how we die, huh?

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:06.836
<i>Pod 471.</i>

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.138
<i>Do you read?</i>

01:05:14.137 --> 01:05:15.271
<i>Pod 471.</i>

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:19.469
<i>This is the Orion escape pod.
Do you read?</i>

01:05:21.435 --> 01:05:24.303
I... I read you,
this is Issac Havelock.

01:05:24.336 --> 01:05:25.737
<i>Good to hear
your voice, Issac.</i>

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:29.836
<i>We're on final approach at a
range of approximately 70 miles.</i>

01:05:29.869 --> 01:05:31.303
<i>We're coming for you, buddy.</i>

01:05:31.336 --> 01:05:32.837
I love you, guys!

01:05:32.869 --> 01:05:35.435
<i>We're gonna need your
help with the docking procedure.</i>

01:05:35.468 --> 01:05:37.369
<i>So get ready to jump
on your control system.</i>

01:05:37.403 --> 01:05:39.037
Okay, I've got you.
No problem.

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:40.304
Just tell me what to do.

01:05:42.237 --> 01:05:43.303
<i>Standby.</i>

01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:44.970
<i>We're 40 miles and closing.</i>

01:05:55.435 --> 01:05:56.903
<i>Twenty miles.</i>

01:05:59.603 --> 01:06:00.904
I can see them.

01:06:02.368 --> 01:06:03.335
Yeah, this is it.

01:06:03.369 --> 01:06:05.403
I can't believe this is
actually happening.

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:10.837
<i>Performing a
burn to slow our approach.</i>

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:11.870
<i>Standby.</i>

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:14.804
<i>Okay, burn successful.</i>

01:06:16.936 --> 01:06:19.237
<i>Jump on your control
system and hit the button.</i>

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:29.036
<i>Auto-docking
procedure engaged.</i>

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:32.036
<i>Great. We see your beacon.
The ship is guiding us in.</i>

01:06:32.936 --> 01:06:34.335
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:36.903
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

01:06:37.502 --> 01:06:40.004
<i>six, five, four,</i>

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.370
<i>three, two...</i>

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:44.770
<i>One.</i>

01:06:48.837 --> 01:06:50.104
<i>Docking complete.</i>

01:06:50.137 --> 01:06:51.870
<i>Would you do the honors</i>

01:06:51.903 --> 01:06:53.303
<i>and unlock your door
for us, Issac?</i>

01:06:53.336 --> 01:06:54.436
Okay. I've got it.

01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:01.138
<i>Issac,
we need you to unlock the door.</i>

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.970
Eva, unlock the doors.

01:07:06.003 --> 01:07:08.504
<i>Sorry, the door cannot
be opened when undocked.</i>

01:07:09.602 --> 01:07:10.971
But we're docked!

01:07:11.836 --> 01:07:13.103
No, Issac.

01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:15.137
We're not.

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.804
Shit!

01:07:42.837 --> 01:07:45.103
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

01:07:46.169 --> 01:07:47.402
<i>What's wrong, Issac?</i>

01:07:47.436 --> 01:07:48.504
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:55.104
They left me here.

01:07:56.902 --> 01:07:57.971
<i>Who have?</i>

01:08:02.003 --> 01:08:03.302
It wasn't real.

01:08:06.937 --> 01:08:10.303
<i>Warning, oxygen
level at three percent.</i>

01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:22.370
Please.

01:08:22.403 --> 01:08:24.904
<i>Issac,
should I call Control?</i>

01:08:26.403 --> 01:08:27.970
Clara...

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:30.368
<i>Issac,
should I call Control?</i>

01:08:30.403 --> 01:08:35.002
Clar...
I can't breathe.

01:08:35.037 --> 01:08:37.437
<i>Warning, oxygen level
at two percent.</i>

01:08:42.036 --> 01:08:43.602
Repressurize!

01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:47.970
<i>Warning! Automatic repressurization
has been prevented due to fire.</i>

01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:49.136
<i>Would you
like to override?</i>

01:08:50.303 --> 01:08:52.270
Override!

01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:54.269
<i>Okay, confirmed.</i>

01:08:54.303 --> 01:08:55.370
<i>Repressurizing.</i>

01:09:09.368 --> 01:09:11.103
<i>Skill, can you hear us?</i>

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.502
<i>Are you there, Havelock?</i>

01:09:16.502 --> 01:09:18.236
<i>What have you done
to Alana?</i>

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:24.803
I think she's dead.

01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:33.002
I didn't destroy the ship.

01:09:34.469 --> 01:09:36.037
<i>We know.</i>

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:37.167
What do you mean?

01:09:37.203 --> 01:09:39.569
<i>We checked the
camera in your capsule.</i>

01:09:39.602 --> 01:09:42.202
<i>It confirms it was Alana
that entered the ship.</i>

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.403
<i>Docking complete.</i>

01:10:17.069 --> 01:10:18.804
Eva, lights up.

01:10:21.302 --> 01:10:23.803
How long does it
take for them to come 'round?

01:10:24.937 --> 01:10:26.870
Probably
about 30 seconds.

01:10:30.468 --> 01:10:32.202
Ah,
our first customer.

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:34.203
Oh.

01:10:34.235 --> 01:10:36.937
Hello,
Miss Skill.

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:38.537
Wakey, wakey, Skill.

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.470
Up! Get up.

01:10:50.937 --> 01:10:53.203
I thought this was meant
to be a second chance.

01:10:53.235 --> 01:10:55.269
Is
that what they told you?

01:10:55.303 --> 01:10:57.570
Nope. You're here
to work.

01:10:57.602 --> 01:10:59.536
You'll do what we tell you to.

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:01.870
And you're
going to be our little bitch.

01:11:40.268 --> 01:11:42.836
All right.

01:11:42.869 --> 01:11:44.068
Come on.

01:11:44.102 --> 01:11:46.303
Up you get.
Wakey, wakey!

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.803
Wakey, wakey!

01:11:51.935 --> 01:11:52.969
Up!

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:57.036
Come on!

01:12:00.302 --> 01:12:02.303
Get up!

01:12:15.902 --> 01:12:17.035
<i>Fire detected.</i>

01:12:17.069 --> 01:12:19.303
<i>Emergency separation
initiated.</i>

01:13:16.569 --> 01:13:18.335
What the...

01:13:18.369 --> 01:13:22.036
Good, you're awake.

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:30.969
I can't believe she really
killed all those people.

01:13:33.302 --> 01:13:34.835
<i>Listen, Havelock.</i>

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:36.803
<i>Your oxygen levels
are running very low</i>

01:13:36.836 --> 01:13:39.804
<i>due to a repressurization
that happened earlier.</i>

01:13:39.835 --> 01:13:43.302
<i>Most likely as a result
of the fire.</i>

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:46.403
<i>Unfortunately, it also looks
like you've got some damage</i>

01:13:46.436 --> 01:13:48.336
<i>to your ship's
electrical systems.</i>

01:13:48.368 --> 01:13:50.035
I already know all of this.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.502
So what are you telling me?

01:13:52.536 --> 01:13:54.570
<i>I'm sincerely sorry.</i>

01:13:54.602 --> 01:13:55.869
Why?

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:00.902
- <i>We've looked at every option.</i>
- No.

01:14:00.935 --> 01:14:02.370
<i>Every contingency plan.</i>

01:14:02.402 --> 01:14:04.169
<i>But there's no ship
in the vicinity,</i>

01:14:04.203 --> 01:14:07.236
<i>NASA, military, or our own
that can reach you.</i>

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:09.035
Please.

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.270
<i>And your oxygen
is going to expire</i>

01:14:11.303 --> 01:14:13.303
<i>before we can mount a rescue.</i>

01:14:13.336 --> 01:14:15.470
<i>I'm really,
really sorry, Issac.</i>

01:14:18.136 --> 01:14:20.003
What about re-entry?

01:14:20.036 --> 01:14:21.470
<i>It's highly unlikely</i>

01:14:21.503 --> 01:14:23.836
<i>the capsule would make it
through the atmosphere.</i>

01:14:23.868 --> 01:14:26.203
<i>I'm sorry, Issac.</i>

01:14:26.235 --> 01:14:28.936
<i>We've done everything
we can down here.</i>

01:14:35.468 --> 01:14:36.902
I'm sure you have.

01:14:40.168 --> 01:14:42.936
Let's stop pretending,
shall we?

01:14:42.968 --> 01:14:44.869
You were never going to rescue
us, because...

01:14:45.604 --> 01:14:47.936
Alana blew
the whole thing up.

01:14:48.402 --> 01:14:49.503
<i>No.</i>

01:14:53.235 --> 01:14:54.868
Are there loads
of other people

01:14:54.902 --> 01:14:56.902
trapped inside a capsule,
floating around?

01:14:58.101 --> 01:14:59.370
<i>Forty-nine.</i>

01:14:59.403 --> 01:15:01.170
<i>And no,
they're not innocent.</i>

01:15:01.203 --> 01:15:02.270
<i>They're criminals.</i>

01:15:08.469 --> 01:15:10.070
I'm not a murderer.

01:15:12.536 --> 01:15:14.003
I'm here because

01:15:14.035 --> 01:15:16.002
you plucked people
from the system

01:15:16.035 --> 01:15:18.303
under the pretense that...

01:15:18.335 --> 01:15:20.403
that they did something wrong.

01:15:22.368 --> 01:15:25.270
If you filled the whole
thing up with serial killers,

01:15:26.036 --> 01:15:27.770
you'd have no one
to do the work.

01:15:29.336 --> 01:15:31.370
So, my guess is

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:33.236
you made a mistake
with Alana.

01:15:36.068 --> 01:15:40.469
But there must be hundreds of
victims of this experiment of yours.

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:42.270
Tell me,

01:15:42.302 --> 01:15:44.136
are you planning on
rescuing any of them?

01:15:47.136 --> 01:15:49.270
<i>We're doing
everything we can.</i>

01:15:49.802 --> 01:15:51.137
Well, that's a no, then.

01:15:54.503 --> 01:15:56.070
<i>Goodbye, Issac.</i>

01:15:56.702 --> 01:15:58.403
<i>Call terminated.</i>

01:15:58.436 --> 01:15:59.469
Have a nice life.

01:16:03.135 --> 01:16:04.570
<i>Issac?</i>

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:06.469
What, Eva?

01:16:06.502 --> 01:16:10.202
<i>You have used nine of
your ten calls this month.</i>

01:16:10.235 --> 01:16:13.570
<i>Inbound and outbound calls
count towards your allowance.</i>

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:16.902
<i>Calls may be monitored
by staff for violations.</i>

01:16:34.503 --> 01:16:36.302
Eva.

01:16:36.336 --> 01:16:38.435
Do you think
we'll make re-entry?

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:41.203
<i>Odds of survival
are 22%.</i>

01:16:43.968 --> 01:16:45.269
Would you risk it?

01:16:45.302 --> 01:16:46.503
<i>No.</i>

01:16:49.369 --> 01:16:52.403
How long have I got
if I stay?

01:16:52.436 --> 01:16:55.369
<i>Water supply will
deplete in four days.</i>

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:57.570
<i>Food will deplete
in one day.</i>

01:16:57.602 --> 01:17:00.569
<i>Oxygen tanks will
deplete in nine hours.</i>

01:17:00.603 --> 01:17:04.436
<i>Stabilization system fuel
will deplete in 17 hours.</i>

01:17:04.469 --> 01:17:08.069
<i>Carbon dioxide levels will
become toxic in 18 hours.</i>

01:17:10.503 --> 01:17:12.102
So, I have a day.

01:17:12.136 --> 01:17:13.203
<i>Yes.</i>

01:17:17.368 --> 01:17:18.536
Eva, flip a coin.

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:21.237
<i>It's tails.</i>

01:17:23.469 --> 01:17:26.203
All right, so if I leave it up to
chance, I'm staying.

01:17:32.835 --> 01:17:34.169
Eva, call Clara.

01:17:34.203 --> 01:17:36.203
<i>Sure, Issac.
Dialing.</i>

01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:42.102
<i>Issac.</i>

01:17:43.069 --> 01:17:44.969
<i>You okay?</i>

01:17:45.001 --> 01:17:46.770
Better for hearing
your voice.

01:17:47.903 --> 01:17:50.236
<i>You know,
the Prime Minister was just on TV</i>

01:17:50.268 --> 01:17:52.269
<i>saying he'll pardon
anyone who makes it back.</i>

01:17:52.302 --> 01:17:54.469
That's 'cause
he doesn't think anyone will.

01:17:54.502 --> 01:17:56.302
<i>Don't be so negative.</i>

01:17:59.303 --> 01:18:01.236
Listen...

01:18:01.269 --> 01:18:03.003
There's no easy way
to say this...

01:18:05.503 --> 01:18:07.303
I've got some bad news.

01:18:09.069 --> 01:18:11.103
They're, they're not
coming to get me.

01:18:12.303 --> 01:18:14.137
My oxygen runs out in a day.

01:18:15.602 --> 01:18:17.003
So...

01:18:20.202 --> 01:18:22.436
So, I think...
I think this is goodbye.

01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:29.202
Are you there?

01:18:30.303 --> 01:18:31.437
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:18:35.835 --> 01:18:38.135
I'm sorry for everything.

01:18:38.169 --> 01:18:40.469
I'm sorry for what I did.

01:18:40.503 --> 01:18:42.336
That I'm here
and I can't get back to you.

01:18:42.368 --> 01:18:44.369
<i>You don't
need to apologize.</i>

01:18:44.402 --> 01:18:46.036
<i>This isn't your fault.</i>

01:18:51.835 --> 01:18:53.502
<i>Don't give up.</i>

01:18:53.534 --> 01:18:55.335
Clara, they said...

01:18:55.368 --> 01:18:56.802
<i>Don't listen to them.</i>

01:18:56.835 --> 01:18:57.902
<i>Is there a chance?</i>

01:19:01.102 --> 01:19:02.502
A very slim one.

01:19:02.534 --> 01:19:04.036
<i>Then you take it.</i>

01:19:06.202 --> 01:19:07.903
<i>Right, you hear me, right?</i>

01:19:07.935 --> 01:19:10.802
<i>Please... Issac.</i>

01:19:10.835 --> 01:19:12.935
<i>You know, people
are putting bets on you.</i>

01:19:13.602 --> 01:19:14.669
Clara, listen...

01:19:14.701 --> 01:19:17.902
<i>About whether
you make it back or not.</i>

01:19:17.935 --> 01:19:20.502
Listen to me, Clara.

01:19:20.534 --> 01:19:23.335
<i>The odds
are pretty one-sided</i>

01:19:23.368 --> 01:19:25.436
<i>but that means the
return would be great.</i>

01:19:26.568 --> 01:19:28.935
This is how we got
in this mess

01:19:28.968 --> 01:19:31.036
in the first place.
That's why I'm here!

01:19:31.068 --> 01:19:32.935
<i>I've already
done it!</i>

01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:42.003
Please tell me you didn't
bet on me making it back.

01:19:43.302 --> 01:19:45.102
<i>I'll tell you
when you get back.</i>

01:19:46.535 --> 01:19:48.137
<i>Don't be mad at me.</i>

01:19:48.436 --> 01:19:49.502
<i>Just...</i>

01:19:50.103 --> 01:19:52.969
<i>Promise me...</i>

01:19:53.002 --> 01:19:54.237
<i>...you're going to try.</i>

01:19:54.936 --> 01:19:56.070
I'll try.

01:20:00.303 --> 01:20:02.836
I love you.

01:20:02.868 --> 01:20:04.402
<i>I love you.</i>

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:07.936
<i>Call terminated.</i>

01:20:15.467 --> 01:20:16.503
Wish me luck.

01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:27.468
That woman's gonna be
the death of me.

01:20:29.202 --> 01:20:30.335
Not that one.

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:31.802
Not dead, then?

01:20:31.835 --> 01:20:33.969
Not yet.

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:36.468
Twenty-two percent.
I don't like those odds.

01:20:36.502 --> 01:20:37.936
We're going home.

01:20:37.969 --> 01:20:39.170
We have to try.

01:21:04.935 --> 01:21:05.935
Don't do this.

01:21:07.936 --> 01:21:09.336
Work with me?

01:21:09.368 --> 01:21:11.435
I want to take out the
people who sent us here.

01:21:13.467 --> 01:21:15.237
I just want
to see my family.

01:21:16.569 --> 01:21:19.002
Then you'll have to
kill me.

01:21:19.036 --> 01:21:21.535
Then you'll be
just as bad as I am.

01:21:21.569 --> 01:21:25.036
They'll watch it
back on the camera.

01:21:25.069 --> 01:21:27.803
They'll find any reason not to
pardon you when you get back.

01:21:30.335 --> 01:21:31.469
I don't want
to kill you.

01:22:08.535 --> 01:22:10.535
Don't struggle.

01:22:44.367 --> 01:22:46.802
So this is it.
