00:02.878 --> 00:04.880
What are you doing?

00:02.878 --> 00:04.880
Playing with ants.

00:04.922 --> 00:07.257
Looking for a little picnic,

00:04.922 --> 00:07.257
huh?

00:07.299 --> 00:09.551
Looks like you've come

00:07.299 --> 00:09.551
to the wrong place.

00:09.593 --> 00:10.886
There's one on your hand.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.221
Ha, ha...

00:13.263 --> 00:15.432
He's got a little

00:13.263 --> 00:15.432
surprise coming.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.685
Stupid ant.

(groaning)

00:58.934 --> 01:01.269
Since Stevie's mom deserted him,

01:01.311 --> 01:03.188
he's been living

01:01.311 --> 01:03.188
a little more dangerously.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.607
Yesterday he read a book

01:03.230 --> 01:05.607
in dim light.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.735
Now he's making

01:05.649 --> 01:07.735
his first prank phone call.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.319
(British accent):

01:07.776 --> 01:09.319
Hello...

01:09.361 --> 01:14.700
is your... refrigerator...

01:14.742 --> 01:17.327
(normal voice):

01:14.742 --> 01:17.327
Yeah... it's me.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.914
We have got to get tickets to

01:17.369 --> 01:19.914
this baseball card convention.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.122
You know who's going

01:19.955 --> 01:21.122
to be there?

01:21.164 --> 01:22.290
Reggie Jackson,

01:22.332 --> 01:25.126
Sammy Sosa, Barry Bonds

01:22.332 --> 01:25.126
and Pete Bucowski.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.754
Pete Bucowski!

01:26.795 --> 01:28.839
Who?

01:26.795 --> 01:28.839
Oh, for the...

01:28.881 --> 01:32.051
Only the first Polish-American

01:28.881 --> 01:32.051
lefty from the tri-county area

01:32.091 --> 01:34.678
to play two complete seasons

01:32.091 --> 01:34.678
in the majors.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.305
And you call yourselves fans.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.640
It's not in there either.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.308
I can't find my lucky shirt.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.143
Your what?

01:40.350 --> 01:42.143
My lucky shirt.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.729
The shirt that

01:42.185 --> 01:43.729
gives me good luck.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.147
I wear it and I'm lucky.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.399
Lucky shirt.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.026
You ever hear

01:47.441 --> 01:49.026
anything so stupid?

01:49.068 --> 01:51.612
You're asking me...

01:51.653 --> 01:53.781
about luck?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.532
DEWEY:

01:53.822 --> 01:55.532
Here it is! That's better.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.158
I don't know

01:55.574 --> 01:57.158
what I would've done

01:57.200 --> 01:58.159
without my lucky shirt.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.912
It's not a lucky shirt.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.163
Hey, look.

02:02.205 --> 02:05.000
An M&M.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.087
Here you go, Abe.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.254
Thank you so much

02:09.296 --> 02:11.590
for helping us bachelors

02:09.296 --> 02:11.590
with our laundry, Lois.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.175
Wow, the collars are so crisp.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.385
That's her signature.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.678
Oh, honestly.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.973
It's just a little spray starch

02:16.720 --> 02:18.973
and a firm hand.

02:19.014 --> 02:22.350
So, Abe, how's

02:19.014 --> 02:22.350
the divorce going?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.435
It's a nightmare, Hal.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.270
Kitty is out of control.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.065
She wears these outrageous

02:25.312 --> 02:28.065
miniskirts to court,

02:28.107 --> 02:29.190
flirts with the judge...

02:29.232 --> 02:30.191
What did your lawyer do?

02:30.233 --> 02:32.820
He asked me if she could

02:30.233 --> 02:32.820
sit at our table.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.029
Whoa.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.196
You know, Abe,

02:34.071 --> 02:35.196
it's been a while.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.075
Maybe you should think about

02:35.238 --> 02:38.075
getting out there again.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.284
Oh, I've taken care of that.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.120
I've decided to spend

02:39.326 --> 02:41.120
the rest of my life

02:41.161 --> 02:42.496
in misery and die alone.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.872
(door opens)

02:43.914 --> 02:46.207
Sorry, I was driving home and

02:43.914 --> 02:46.207
knew I wouldn't make it.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.460
This was the

02:46.249 --> 02:48.460
nearest safe house.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.253
Hot soup!

02:51.505 --> 02:52.923
I'm taking Jamie to the park.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.466
We're going to look

02:52.965 --> 02:54.466
for butterflies

02:54.508 --> 02:56.175
and talk about his birth trauma.

02:57.636 --> 02:58.512
Sounds good.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.638
Oh, Polly,

02:58.553 --> 02:59.638
this is Abe.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.514
Hi.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.182
Hi.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.227
Oh, my God.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
That woman fell

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
out of the sexy tree

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
and hit every branch

03:09.481 --> 03:10.816
on the way down.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.401
Abe, you dog.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.736
Why don't you

03:13.443 --> 03:14.736
ask her out?

03:14.778 --> 03:16.321
Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.699
To be honest, I didn't

03:16.363 --> 03:18.699
even ask Kitty out.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.452
My dad asked her dad,

03:18.740 --> 03:22.452
and we gave her family a ham.

03:22.494 --> 03:26.247
But maybe you could

03:22.494 --> 03:26.247
ask her for me.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.249
No. I don't

03:26.289 --> 03:28.249
do that anymore.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.294
My setups have a way

03:28.291 --> 03:31.294
of not working out.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.172
You just told me

03:31.336 --> 03:33.172
I should get out there

03:33.212 --> 03:35.256
and now you're

03:33.212 --> 03:35.256
crushing my dreams.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.967
Abe, you read about

03:35.298 --> 03:36.967
the guy who woke up

03:37.009 --> 03:39.178
in a tub full of ice

03:37.009 --> 03:39.178
with his kidney gone?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.554
One of my setups.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.263
And I had a really good

03:40.595 --> 03:42.263
feeling about that one.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.933
Please. I need this.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.101
Oh, all right.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.519
But I'm warning you,

03:47.561 --> 03:50.105
I have a really

03:47.561 --> 03:50.105
good feeling about

03:47.561 --> 03:50.105
this one, too.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.818
Halftime.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.196
POLLY:

03:55.694 --> 03:57.196
Nighty-night.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.074
Oh, if Jamie

03:57.237 --> 04:00.074
has that dream again--

04:00.115 --> 04:01.575
I think it's about

04:00.115 --> 04:01.575
a bad teddy--

04:01.616 --> 04:03.326
try and get him

04:01.616 --> 04:03.326
to ride it out.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.286
He's got to defeat

04:03.368 --> 04:05.286
that thing.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.205
Got it.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.748
Oh, listen, Polly,

04:07.789 --> 04:09.374
are you doing anything

04:07.789 --> 04:09.374
Friday night?

04:09.416 --> 04:13.879
Oh, my God,

04:09.416 --> 04:13.879
I've been dreading this day.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.090
This is what happened

04:13.921 --> 04:16.090
on my last job.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.299
Of course he told me he only

04:16.131 --> 04:18.299
had six months to live.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.801
And, boy, did he live.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.095
No. No, no.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.179
Polly, Polly...

04:22.221 --> 04:23.805
I was asking for

04:22.221 --> 04:23.805
my friend, Abe.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.306
He was here

04:23.847 --> 04:25.306
the other day.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.350
Oh. Stevie's dad?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.310
Yeah. Oh, he's a great guy.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.898
A lot of fun, a big heart,

04:29.352 --> 04:32.898
a great personality...

04:32.940 --> 04:34.315
I know he's fat, Hal.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
That wasn't...

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
Oh, no, that's okay.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.695
To tell you the truth,

04:36.359 --> 04:38.695
I prefer big men.

04:38.737 --> 04:39.780
So have him call me.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.989
All right!

04:41.031 --> 04:42.323
But this should

04:41.031 --> 04:42.323
not be construed

04:42.365 --> 04:43.825
as a setup in any way,

04:43.867 --> 04:46.494
because he was

04:43.867 --> 04:46.494
going to ask you out

04:43.867 --> 04:46.494
in the first place.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.747
If you're gonna do

04:46.536 --> 04:48.747
this, you need to

04:46.536 --> 04:48.747
promise in advance

04:48.789 --> 04:50.165
that you're not

04:48.789 --> 04:50.165
going to stalk him

04:50.207 --> 04:52.000
or run him over

04:50.207 --> 04:52.000
with a car

04:52.042 --> 04:53.334
or suddenly decide

04:53.376 --> 04:54.335
he looks like

04:53.376 --> 04:54.335
your stepbrother

04:54.377 --> 04:55.796
and throw a steam

04:54.377 --> 04:55.796
iron at him.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.423
I drifted off, Hal,

04:55.837 --> 04:58.423
but okay.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.052
And after the movie

05:00.050 --> 05:02.052
we took off our shoes

05:02.094 --> 05:03.804
and walked barefoot

05:02.094 --> 05:03.804
through the mall.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.347
I tell you, Hal,

05:03.845 --> 05:06.347
I feel like a new man.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.348
Yesterday

05:06.389 --> 05:07.348
I was watching

05:07.390 --> 05:09.350
a Pepe LePew cartoon

05:07.390 --> 05:09.350
and I thought,

05:09.392 --> 05:12.353
"So he doesn't get the cat.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.353
Is that anything to cry over?"

05:12.395 --> 05:14.815
Wow. That is a real

05:12.395 --> 05:14.815
breakthrough, Abe.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.566
I'm definitely going

05:14.856 --> 05:16.566
to see her again.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.026
Well, she's here tomorrow.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.026
I'll ask her...

05:18.068 --> 05:20.612
No, no, I already

05:18.068 --> 05:20.612
asked her out. Myself.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.529
It was amazing.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.033
I was like some

05:21.571 --> 05:25.033
magnificent beast.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.952
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:26.994 --> 05:30.122
I'm going to add

05:26.994 --> 05:30.122
my own fabric softener.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.209
Francis, look at

05:31.331 --> 05:34.209
this Visa bill.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.795
What did we say about

05:34.251 --> 05:36.795
expenditures over $100?

05:38.421 --> 05:40.381
I needed a new hat.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.800
Give me your card.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.469
Piama, this is stupid.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.888
Give me your card.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.021
(imitates whip crack)

05:55.689 --> 05:57.274
Thanks for letting me

05:57.316 --> 05:59.067
get ready here, Lois.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.068
Which earrings?

06:00.110 --> 06:01.402
Well, the dangly

06:00.110 --> 06:01.402
are a little...

06:01.444 --> 06:02.779
Oh, I was asking Jamie.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.907
I'm sorry, but he's

06:02.821 --> 06:05.907
really good at this.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.119
Oh, you're right.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.119
What was I thinking?

06:09.161 --> 06:11.038
I'm so nervous.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.041
This is the third date,

06:11.079 --> 06:14.041
and you know what that means.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.293
Well, Polly...

06:16.335 --> 06:17.418
Oh, no. Not that.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.713
I get that out of the way

06:17.460 --> 06:19.713
on the first date.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.256
Makes everyone more relaxed.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.258
No, tonight we're going to do

06:21.298 --> 06:23.258
tribal scarring

06:23.300 --> 06:25.552
and then go to Ben and Jerry's.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.430
Well, it may not be

06:26.845 --> 06:29.430
our idea of romance,

06:29.472 --> 06:31.141
but those two have

06:29.472 --> 06:31.141
really hit it off.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.060
And here I was convinced

06:31.183 --> 06:33.060
setting people up

06:33.101 --> 06:34.435
was a recipe for disaster.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.437
I was skeptical, too,

06:34.477 --> 06:36.437
but you know what?

06:36.479 --> 06:39.066
I was wrong,

06:36.479 --> 06:39.066
and I'm happy to admit it.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.650
(doorbell rings)

06:40.692 --> 06:42.736
(ringing)

06:40.692 --> 06:42.736
Hold on, lover boy.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.404
She's not quite...

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
Craig?

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
Hi.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.284
Is Polly ready?

06:50.369 --> 06:51.619
Hi, Craig.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.619
She'll be out in a minute.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.372
Don't you look nice?

06:53.412 --> 06:55.456
Thanks. I set my Flowbee

06:53.412 --> 06:55.456
on "hot."

06:55.498 --> 06:56.457
Hi.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.460
Mm, what is that

06:56.499 --> 06:59.460
intoxicating fragrance?

06:59.502 --> 07:00.545
Oh, it's Glade.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.089
It suits you.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.424
Have fun, you two.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.137
That's not Abe.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.555
No, that's Craig.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.555
What about it?

07:10.597 --> 07:13.058
She can't be dating Craig.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.058
She's dating Abe.

07:13.100 --> 07:13.975
What are you talking about?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.685
I set up Abe and Polly.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.479
I set up Craig and Polly.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.775
All the time we've been

07:19.898 --> 07:21.775
talking about Polly's date,

07:21.816 --> 07:24.069
we've been talking about

07:21.816 --> 07:24.069
two different people?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.070
I haven't been.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.154
I clearly remember saying,

07:26.196 --> 07:28.489
"Overweight,

07:26.196 --> 07:28.489
nearsighted, lonely,

07:28.531 --> 07:31.785
lost his kitty..."

07:31.826 --> 07:33.745
Oh, my God.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.082
I picked up some

07:34.955 --> 07:37.082
cold medicine for you.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.792
I told you I'm fine.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.711
You know what happens

07:38.833 --> 07:41.711
when you get that scratchy

07:38.833 --> 07:41.711
thing in your throat.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.797
I don't need it.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.007
I'm not gonna be up all

07:43.838 --> 07:46.007
night with you coughing.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.175
Just take it.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.428
Señora.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.179
Señora.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.223
(snickering)

07:53.265 --> 07:55.309
You have to stop

07:53.265 --> 07:55.309
telling me what to do.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.977
You are putting me

07:55.350 --> 07:56.977
in a horrible position

07:57.018 --> 07:59.520
in front of my guys, Piama,

07:57.018 --> 07:59.520
and it's getting worse.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.688
They're not doing the work?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.399
What? No, they do

08:00.730 --> 08:02.399
plenty of work.

08:02.441 --> 08:03.900
Then what's the problem?

08:03.942 --> 08:07.946
They're... teasing me.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.407
The other boys

08:07.988 --> 08:10.407
are teasing you.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.992
Let me explain something

08:10.449 --> 08:11.992
to you, Piama.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.787
The whole macho thing is

08:12.033 --> 08:15.787
very big in Mexican culture.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.539
No, it's actually big

08:15.829 --> 08:18.539
in every culture,

08:18.581 --> 08:20.167
and I'm not buying into it

08:20.208 --> 08:22.585
just because these guys

08:20.208 --> 08:22.585
are acting like jerks.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.882
(coughs)

08:28.675 --> 08:30.885
(coughing)

08:32.679 --> 08:33.930
(chuckles)

08:33.972 --> 08:35.849
That's a good boy.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.727
(laughing)

08:39.769 --> 08:41.271
I will not be mocked.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.605
(laughing)

08:42.647 --> 08:43.857
Do you hear me?!

08:43.898 --> 08:45.566
(laughing)

08:45.608 --> 08:46.567
I'm not kidding!

08:46.609 --> 08:47.986
I'm sorry.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.986
(laughing)

08:54.617 --> 08:56.244
Clean socks.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.789
Yes!

08:57.204 --> 08:59.789
Lucky shirt strikes again.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.501
It's not a lucky shirt.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.584
You shouldn't criticize things

09:03.626 --> 09:05.003
you're not equipped

09:03.626 --> 09:05.003
to understand, Malcolm.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.963
It's a shirt.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.963
It's just fabric.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.589
There's nothing

09:07.005 --> 09:08.589
in there but atoms.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.425
Luck atoms.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.759
There are no luck atoms.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.594
Everyone has some kind

09:11.801 --> 09:13.594
of luck, Malcolm.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.431
Like you, you're lucky

09:13.636 --> 09:16.431
at taking tests.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.600
I bust my ass

09:16.473 --> 09:19.600
to get good grades.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.686
Why does my lucky shirt

09:19.642 --> 09:21.686
make you so mad?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.604
Because believing in

09:21.728 --> 09:23.604
that kind of nonsense

09:23.646 --> 09:26.607
isn't smart or healthy

09:23.646 --> 09:26.607
or good for society.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.194
The world doesn't work

09:26.649 --> 09:29.194
by magic or superstition.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.653
It's rational.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.865
Maybe you believe that because

09:30.695 --> 09:33.865
all you're good at is thinking,

09:33.907 --> 09:35.200
and if the world

09:33.907 --> 09:35.200
isn't logical

09:35.242 --> 09:36.993
then you're lost.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.038
Okay, fine.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.038
You know what, Dewey, luck this.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.458
(shrieks, groans)

09:43.500 --> 09:46.627
This... proves nothing.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.213
(whimpers)

09:48.255 --> 09:50.715
ABE: I can't believe

09:48.255 --> 09:50.715
she's seeing someone else.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.342
She just came right

09:50.757 --> 09:52.342
out and said it

09:52.384 --> 09:53.510
like it was no big deal.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.053
Said she didn't want

09:53.552 --> 09:55.053
to be chained down.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.637
Chained down.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.637
Can you believe it?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.014
Yeah, I can.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.225
But then I've had some time

09:58.056 --> 10:00.225
to process it, Abe.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.643
You told me twice last night

10:00.267 --> 10:02.643
and the day before that

10:02.685 --> 10:03.811
when you showed up at work.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.938
I sense his presence, Hal.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.814
His essence lingering.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.233
Picture it, Hal.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.277
I want you

10:08.275 --> 10:10.277
to picture it.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.113
Her lips on

10:10.318 --> 10:13.113
another man's lips.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.364
Not mine.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.534
What's wrong

10:14.406 --> 10:17.534
with my lips?

10:19.286 --> 10:20.912
I wish I knew who it was.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.247
If I ever find out

10:20.954 --> 10:22.247
who it is

10:22.289 --> 10:26.334
I will track him down to

10:22.289 --> 10:26.334
his evil lair and... and...

10:26.376 --> 10:28.669
I'll probably just take

10:26.376 --> 10:28.669
a lot of telephoto shots

10:28.711 --> 10:30.046
and start dressing

10:28.711 --> 10:30.046
like him.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.090
You have to have some

10:30.088 --> 10:32.090
clue to his identity.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.174
Think, Lois, think!

10:33.216 --> 10:36.094
Craig, you're

10:33.216 --> 10:36.094
driving me crazy.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.138
I'm sorry.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.138
You're right.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.473
Absolutely right.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.475
Is he rich?

10:41.516 --> 10:43.268
Famous? Athletic?

10:43.310 --> 10:46.271
Muscular?

10:43.310 --> 10:46.271
Intellectual? Slim?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.897
Is he lit from within

10:47.939 --> 10:50.108
by a quiet, inner strength

10:47.939 --> 10:50.108
and steely resolve?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.359
It's so unfair.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.694
Why does he have

10:51.401 --> 10:53.694
to have my woman?

10:53.736 --> 10:54.779
Oh, God...

10:54.821 --> 10:56.906
it's not that hunk

10:54.821 --> 10:56.906
from the calendar

10:56.948 --> 10:58.158
holding the tires, is it?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.867
I can't compete with that.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.287
How can I compete with that?

11:02.329 --> 11:04.080
Sure, I've got my joke book,

11:04.122 --> 11:06.166
but that really

11:04.122 --> 11:06.166
only takes me so far.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.960
Why would God give me

11:06.207 --> 11:08.960
a glimpse of paradise

11:09.002 --> 11:11.212
just to slam the gate

11:09.002 --> 11:11.212
in my face?

11:11.254 --> 11:12.713
God hates me.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.635
(sobbing):

11:12.755 --> 11:16.635
I'm so unhappy.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.635
(sobbing):

11:12.755 --> 11:16.635
I'm so unhappy.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.725
You have

11:23.183 --> 11:24.725
to choose, Polly.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.726
I can't.

11:25.768 --> 11:29.230
I keep trying,

11:25.768 --> 11:29.230
but it just isn't easy.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.399
Honestly, Lois, as a woman,

11:31.441 --> 11:33.610
could you choose

11:31.441 --> 11:33.610
between Craig and Abe?

11:33.652 --> 11:35.445
Well, um, thankfully,

11:35.487 --> 11:39.782
I don't have to make

11:35.487 --> 11:39.782
such a difficult decision.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.451
But the important thing is,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.451
Polly,

11:41.493 --> 11:42.619
you do.

11:42.661 --> 11:43.828
But it's impossible.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.374
Every time I try and weigh

11:43.870 --> 11:47.374
their strengths and attractions,

11:47.415 --> 11:49.250
they come out even.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.170
Craig has that

11:49.292 --> 11:52.170
sexy self-confidence

11:52.212 --> 11:54.255
and love of fantasy play,

11:54.297 --> 11:57.925
and Abe is warm and kind

11:54.297 --> 11:57.925
and he gets one extra point

11:57.967 --> 11:58.801
because he's black.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.761
He just does.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.761
There, I've said it.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.847
Plus this is all complicated

12:00.803 --> 12:02.847
by the fact

12:02.889 --> 12:06.393
that I am having the most

12:02.889 --> 12:06.393
exciting time of my life

12:06.434 --> 12:08.186
and never want it to end.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.062
But, Polly...

12:09.103 --> 12:10.813
I'm sorry. I have to go.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.773
I'm meeting Craig for Laser Tag

12:12.815 --> 12:15.360
and then Abe

12:12.815 --> 12:15.360
at the Cheesecake Factory.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.655
You know,

12:15.402 --> 12:18.655
if society weren't so hung up,

12:18.697 --> 12:20.823
we'd have the solution.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.200
(door opens)

12:22.242 --> 12:23.784
Okay, we're just

12:22.242 --> 12:23.784
going to have

12:23.826 --> 12:25.412
to help make

12:23.826 --> 12:25.412
the decision for her.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.287
You're right.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.706
Can you get Abe

12:26.329 --> 12:27.706
to back off?

12:27.746 --> 12:28.665
What? Why Abe?

12:28.707 --> 12:30.208
Why can't you get Craig

12:28.707 --> 12:30.208
to back off?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.377
Craig will fall apart.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.377
Abe can take it.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.503
He's more mature.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.796
The man sleeps with

12:33.545 --> 12:35.796
a night-light, Lois!

12:35.838 --> 12:37.257
Eight hours, Hal!

12:37.298 --> 12:40.801
For eight hours

12:37.298 --> 12:40.801
I had to watch Craig

12:37.298 --> 12:40.801
practice revenge faces.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.803
Wait, wait, wait, wait,

12:40.843 --> 12:42.803
this is crazy.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.472
We shouldn't be fighting.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.057
We should just stay out

12:44.514 --> 12:46.057
of this whole thing.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.808
You're right.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.227
They're both our friends.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.811
One of them will screw up

12:49.269 --> 12:50.811
eventually.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.812
Exactly.

12:51.854 --> 12:56.109
I just wish I could stop

12:51.854 --> 12:56.109
picturing the sex.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.447
Pete Bucowski never got

12:57.569 --> 13:00.447
discouraged, even when

13:00.488 --> 13:02.823
he got sent down to the minors

13:00.488 --> 13:02.823
for the fifth time.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.823
Let's go over there.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.826
He just shrugged and grinned

13:02.865 --> 13:05.826
that grin he had and said,

13:05.868 --> 13:06.869
"Hey, what the hey."

13:06.911 --> 13:08.288
It was like his catchphrase.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.123
Look, goose bumps.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.458
Great, Mom.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.751
We're gonna find Reggie Jackson.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.835
Okay, but don't miss

13:12.791 --> 13:14.835
Pete Bucowski.

13:14.877 --> 13:18.423
He's only appearing

13:14.877 --> 13:18.423
at 11:30, 12:15, 1:00,

13:18.465 --> 13:21.842
2:30, 3:15,

13:18.465 --> 13:21.842
4:30 and 6:00!

13:21.884 --> 13:23.844
Thanks so much

13:21.884 --> 13:23.844
for inviting me.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.138
I really needed something

13:25.179 --> 13:27.265
to take my mind

13:25.179 --> 13:27.265
off of my love life.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.768
Well, that's why

13:27.307 --> 13:29.768
God invented baseball.

13:29.808 --> 13:30.851
And war.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.354
Look, Pete will come

13:30.893 --> 13:33.354
to your birthday party.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.149
Be sure to turn in your

13:33.396 --> 13:36.149
ticket stubs to be eligible

13:36.190 --> 13:38.109
for a chance to win

13:36.190 --> 13:38.109
Reggie Jackson's

13:38.151 --> 13:40.819
450th home run ball.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.824
I thought they said

13:42.322 --> 13:45.824
I'd be roped off.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.578
I won't let you touch the ball,

13:48.620 --> 13:51.872
but I will let you touch

13:48.620 --> 13:51.872
my hand after my hand

13:48.620 --> 13:51.872
has touched the ball.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.333
Shut up, Dewey.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.793
You know what?

13:53.374 --> 13:54.793
If you win,

13:54.833 --> 13:56.544
I will kiss Reese's butt

13:54.833 --> 13:56.544
on that stage.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.754
Deal. Shake.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.754
No take-backs.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.964
Fine.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.094
Any rituals you go through

14:01.924 --> 14:05.094
before a big game?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.847
Come on.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.847
You can talk to me.

14:09.848 --> 14:10.933
What? Does it violate

14:10.975 --> 14:12.811
your precious chicken code?

14:12.851 --> 14:13.894
Hal, come on.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.524
Guy gets too big to talk

14:13.936 --> 14:17.524
to the fans who made him!

14:17.565 --> 14:18.899
Hal?

14:18.941 --> 14:20.276
Lois?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.362
Polly?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.698
What an incredible coinky-dink.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.782
Hi, Craig.

14:25.824 --> 14:26.949
Hi, Craig.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.909
Hey, Polly, we'll take

14:26.991 --> 14:28.909
Jamie for a while

14:28.951 --> 14:31.621
if you two want to spend

14:28.951 --> 14:31.621
some time together.

14:31.663 --> 14:32.913
Mm...

14:32.955 --> 14:34.332
We had an agreement.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.583
How dare you, Lois!

14:35.625 --> 14:37.960
Polly,

14:38.002 --> 14:39.920
what an

14:38.002 --> 14:39.920
unbelievable surprise.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.422
Think how humiliated Abe--

14:41.464 --> 14:43.174
who coincidentally

14:41.464 --> 14:43.174
just arrived--

14:43.216 --> 14:44.759
is going to feel.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.802
Hi, Abe.

14:45.844 --> 14:46.927
Hi.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.930
Well, well, well. Well.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.976
Polly, you remember my crippled

14:49.972 --> 14:53.976
son Stevie who lost his mother?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.937
I'm... needy.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.189
Hey, Abe, Stevie.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.399
Craig, nice to see you.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.777
My golly, isn't this

14:59.440 --> 15:02.777
gut-wrenching?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.237
Polly, are you okay?

15:04.278 --> 15:06.531
Fine. I just seem to be having

15:06.573 --> 15:08.032
an out-of-body experience

15:08.074 --> 15:10.117
which my shaman would be

15:08.074 --> 15:10.117
very proud of,

15:10.159 --> 15:12.453
except I think I'm going

15:10.159 --> 15:12.453
to be falling down now.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.788
Oh.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.788
I got you, baby.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.790
Daddy's here, angel.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.959
You!

15:19.001 --> 15:19.960
Boys, please, please.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.882
Now, every conflict

15:20.002 --> 15:23.882
invites a dark angel

15:23.923 --> 15:25.383
and an angel of light.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.010
So let's summon

15:25.425 --> 15:28.010
an angel of light!

15:33.474 --> 15:34.975
I've waited

15:33.474 --> 15:34.975
for this moment.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.770
Not as much as I have.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.855
How do you know

15:36.811 --> 15:38.855
how much I have?

15:38.897 --> 15:39.814
Abe, come on.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.981
No, Hal.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.984
He's made a fool of me

15:41.023 --> 15:43.984
for the last time!

15:44.026 --> 15:45.695
Craig, don't do this!

15:45.737 --> 15:47.947
I will not stand by and let him

15:45.737 --> 15:47.947
put the horns on me, Lois.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.535
(yelling)

15:59.876 --> 16:02.295
Oh, my God,

15:59.876 --> 16:02.295
they're killing each other!

16:19.771 --> 16:21.522
CRAIG AND ABE:

16:19.771 --> 16:21.522
Oh! Ow! Oh!

16:21.564 --> 16:23.483
Ow!

16:23.524 --> 16:25.610
Get him... Dad!

16:25.652 --> 16:28.237
Slap him... silly.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.072
Had enough, Feldspar?!

16:30.114 --> 16:32.241
I haven't begun

16:30.114 --> 16:32.241
to have enough!

16:32.283 --> 16:34.410
To... have had enough.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.410
Time-out!

16:34.452 --> 16:36.370
Time-out!

16:40.082 --> 16:41.709
Time-in!

16:56.599 --> 16:59.352
Here's your tuna sandwich

16:56.599 --> 16:59.352
that you wanted.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.228
Thanks.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.272
I just hope I got it for you

17:01.270 --> 17:03.272
fast enough.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.650
Because I know

17:03.314 --> 17:05.650
when my man gets hungry,

17:05.692 --> 17:07.067
he wants to eat

17:05.692 --> 17:07.067
right away.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.695
And that's my job,

17:08.736 --> 17:11.030
to make my man happy.

17:15.326 --> 17:20.039
Well... I hope so, too.

17:20.623 --> 17:21.875
And let's just hope

17:21.916 --> 17:23.501
this isn't a repeat

17:21.916 --> 17:23.501
of the last time.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.127
I mean, let's face it.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.087
That sandwich was a joke.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.591
(quietly):

17:27.129 --> 17:30.591
Let's not turn a favor into

17:27.129 --> 17:30.591
something that you'll regret.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.177
As a matter of fact, I think

17:30.633 --> 17:33.177
I would prefer this toasted.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.890
And I'd like to see

17:33.219 --> 17:36.890
a little garnish this time!

17:36.931 --> 17:40.810
And I'd like you to think

17:36.931 --> 17:40.810
about a certain special thing

17:40.852 --> 17:44.063
that you love

17:40.852 --> 17:44.063
that's never gonna happen again.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.740
No, honey, wait! I'm sorry!

17:53.781 --> 17:55.825
(laughter)

17:57.326 --> 17:58.494
Hey, Reg,

17:58.536 --> 18:00.997
Pete Bucowski,

17:58.536 --> 18:00.997
the Polish Splinter.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.122
Oh, God, I hate

18:01.039 --> 18:02.122
these things.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.542
All the fans

18:02.164 --> 18:04.542
want a piece of you.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.960
Always getting mobbed.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.795
Yeah, yeah.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.795
What do you want me to sign?

18:07.837 --> 18:10.965
Just this ball.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.800
And the 12 shirts

18:11.007 --> 18:12.800
in this box.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.344
Anything you want me to sign?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.138
Okay, the Reggie Jackson

18:16.763 --> 18:18.138
home run ball

18:18.180 --> 18:20.058
will be raffled off

18:18.180 --> 18:20.058
in one minute.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.142
I think I'll put it

18:20.099 --> 18:22.142
on the mantle.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.520
Right after Malcolm

18:22.184 --> 18:24.520
plants one on my butt.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.980
It's a stupid bet.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.941
Yeah, but if he wins,

18:26.022 --> 18:27.941
you're doing it.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.943
Your brother bet you

18:27.982 --> 18:29.943
he'd win the ball?

18:29.984 --> 18:31.402
He thinks he has a lucky shirt.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.528
Lucky shirt.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.947
When I was in Little League,

18:33.988 --> 18:35.573
I had a pair

18:33.988 --> 18:35.573
of smelly old lucky socks

18:35.615 --> 18:36.824
that I wore all summer.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.158
Pretty dumb, huh?

18:38.200 --> 18:38.868
Yeah.

18:38.910 --> 18:39.953
I hit .475

18:39.994 --> 18:42.204
with 50 home runs that season.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.164
Don't let him welsh, kid.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.125
I won't, Reggie.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.752
When Dewey wins,

18:47.794 --> 18:50.088
you pucker up and I will, too.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.007
♪ ♪

19:00.431 --> 19:02.182

Stop this!

19:15.321 --> 19:17.364
Then you have

19:15.321 --> 19:17.364
to choose!

19:17.406 --> 19:19.199
Yeah, choose!

19:19.241 --> 19:20.200
Abe or me!

19:20.242 --> 19:22.244
The dumpy loser

19:20.242 --> 19:22.244
or the one who loves you?!

19:22.286 --> 19:23.412
I'm the one

19:22.286 --> 19:23.412
who loves you.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.455
Don't fall for

19:23.454 --> 19:24.455
his smooth line!

19:24.497 --> 19:26.124
I love you more!

19:26.165 --> 19:28.918
Okay, okay, okay. I choose...

19:26.165 --> 19:28.918
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.045
Jamie.

19:31.087 --> 19:34.214
I'm sorry, but my career's

19:31.087 --> 19:34.214
what's important to me.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.467
You guys have been

19:34.256 --> 19:36.467
a distraction.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.636
An unbelievable carnal

19:36.509 --> 19:38.636
delight...

19:38.678 --> 19:40.220
but a distraction nonetheless.

19:40.262 --> 19:44.183
Baby-sitting is the only thing

19:40.262 --> 19:44.183
I'm really good at.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.312
Uh, where's the baby?

19:48.354 --> 19:52.150
Oh, my God! Jamie!

19:55.277 --> 19:57.196
(baby cooing echoing)

20:07.957 --> 20:10.376
(metallic creaking)

20:17.591 --> 20:19.218
And the winner is...

20:20.302 --> 20:21.762
Give me that!

20:23.139 --> 20:24.849
You're not getting out

20:23.139 --> 20:24.849
of kissing my butt!

20:24.891 --> 20:26.684
Give me back my lucky shirt!

20:26.726 --> 20:28.268
It's not a lucky shirt!

20:28.310 --> 20:30.229
(audience gasps)

20:35.401 --> 20:37.904
Shut up, Dewey.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.532
Oh, my God!

20:42.324 --> 20:45.161
Pete Bucowski

20:42.324 --> 20:45.161
saved my baby!

20:45.203 --> 20:46.453
Glad I could

20:45.203 --> 20:46.453
help, ma'am.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.540
Want to buy an autographed

20:46.495 --> 20:49.540
Reggie Jackson shirt?

20:52.210 --> 20:53.211
It isn't the jacket that smells.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.879
There was a fried apple pie

20:53.252 --> 20:54.879
in the pocket.

20:54.921 --> 20:55.755
Thanks, Lois.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.715
So where are you players headed

20:55.796 --> 20:57.715
tonight?

20:57.757 --> 20:58.758
The Rusty Scupper.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.094
Uh-oh, we better get

20:58.799 --> 21:01.094
a wiggle on, Craig.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.762
Happy Hour starts

21:01.135 --> 21:02.762
in 20 minutes

21:02.803 --> 21:04.304
and the ladies won't wait.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.306
They'll wait for you

21:04.346 --> 21:06.306
in those new chinos.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.392
I won't have a chance with you

21:06.348 --> 21:08.392
in your leather jacket.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.896
Not if they get a load

21:08.434 --> 21:11.896
of your... (crying)

21:11.938 --> 21:12.897
Ah, ah, ah.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.897
Come on.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.108
How are you going

21:12.939 --> 21:15.108
to get on the scene?

21:15.149 --> 21:17.151
Like a sex machine.
