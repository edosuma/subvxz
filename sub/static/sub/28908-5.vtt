00:25.358 --> 00:28.028
Wow! Now this is what I call a pep rally!
[chuckles]

00:28.111 --> 00:31.489
Last year was so bad, the cheerleaders
started cheering for Poly.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.199
Not this year.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.744
This turnout says Poly's going down!

00:36.244 --> 00:38.163
That's right, an upset is up-ruined.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.749
You see what I just did there? Shut up.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.253
This turnout also says we have
total disregard for the fire codes.

00:45.837 --> 00:46.963
I might have to shut this down.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.717
I prefer last year's pep rallies,
when the aisles were clear

00:50.967 --> 00:52.343
and there were lots of empty seats.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.762
Like your birthday party? 

00:54.929 --> 00:58.183
Ooh! [laughs]
She burned you, bro! She burned you!

00:58.266 --> 00:59.976
Now you can call the fire marshal.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.927
People. [laughs]
People, that's not important.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.763
The important thing is, that streak ends

01:36.846 --> 01:40.058
-on Friday!
-[crowd cheers]

01:40.850 --> 01:41.851
Whoo!

01:41.935 --> 01:45.230
That's right, and it doesn't matter
if it's been five, seven,

01:45.313 --> 01:48.399
-or even ten years.
-Oh, it's definitely ten!

01:48.983 --> 01:50.026
We were in kindergarten.

01:51.111 --> 01:57.033
Well, this year, the Rocket's gonna

Man, I have never seen this school
so fired up,

04:06.246 --> 04:07.372
and I was at the assembly

04:07.455 --> 04:10.416
where the Drug Enforcement Panda
got arrested for selling weed.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.421
Well, nothing brings a community together
like the common purpose of football.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.049
The common purpose of hating people
that are different than you

04:18.132 --> 04:19.425
works pretty well, too.

04:21.302 --> 04:25.974
And this week, those two come together
because we all hate Poly football.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.058
[Paula] Mm!

Now that's the killer spirit
we're looking for, Abby.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.366
Well, she didn't have football
in her high school,

04:43.449 --> 04:45.576
so she really doesn't get rivalry week.

04:45.743 --> 04:48.162
Oh, we had a very bitter rivalry
back home.

-[Ray] Mm-hmm?
-With the Methodists.

I really enjoyed
my first Wilson-Poly game last year.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.847
I thought Poly did
some great touchdown dances.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.973
Why didn't we do any?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.143
No touchdowns.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.896
Heh. [clicks tongue] It's a new day, Gabe.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.857
I've broken down a ton of film on Poly,

05:15.940 --> 05:19.360
and I've engineered a game plan
that's gonna whoop their asses.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.154

on his project.

Heh. I'm Gomez. He's Trujillo.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.758

-Hey, Coach.
-Yep?

05:50.975 --> 05:52.226
Can you tell us apart?

05:54.228 --> 05:57.315
Please! You're the one wearing the hat.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.696
Anyway, I wanted to thank you
for being on board

06:03.780 --> 06:06.157
and keeping your priorities straight.
[clicks tongue]

Hey, look, nobody wants to beat Poly
more than I do,

06:10.912 --> 06:14.957
but I think our number one priority needs
to be teaching our kids. Right, Paula?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.337
Oh, sorry, Gabe. [sighs]
I wasn't listening,

06:19.420 --> 06:22.173
I was thinking about
what I was gonna wear to the victory rally

06:22.256 --> 06:23.508
after we beat Poly.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.717
[Ray] Mm-hmm?

06:25.301 --> 06:26.969
Is a bodysuit inappropriate?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.849
Oh, who cares? I call my own shots.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.780
All right, everybody,
hand in your take-home midterm

06:45.863 --> 06:47.657
on Plessy v. Ferguson.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.076
Separate but equal, my black ass!

06:52.537 --> 06:54.872
Just to ease your disappointment
in everyone else,

06:54.956 --> 06:57.834
you should probably grade mine last.
Kinda crushed this one.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.295
All right.
Crushing history, failing humility.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.592
What? Mikey, you're turning in
your assignment on time?

07:06.717 --> 07:07.635
I'm impressed.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.430
Hey, you said if we're failing,
we can't do any extracurrics.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.557
You know, I gotta stay secretary
of the Fortnite club.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.646
Well, uh, mine's more of a manifesto,
so I-- I used an alias.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.360
"Oznerol"?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.906
Yeah, that's "Lorenzo" backwards,
don't tell nobody.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.868
What about you, Rakeem?

07:32.618 --> 07:34.537
Um... I'm good.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.582
No, you're not. You're great.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.669
Damn, Walt, we all need to find someone
who looks at us

07:41.752 --> 07:42.920
the way you look at Rakeem.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.134
But seriously, Rocket,
where's your, uh... Where's your midterm?

07:48.384 --> 07:52.305
Um, it's here and here, and with Him.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.560
All right, well, uh,
have Him give it to you,

07:57.643 --> 07:58.811
and then give it to me.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.899
Dude, if you don't turn it in,
you're failing this class

08:02.982 --> 08:04.484
and you can't play against Poly.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.944
I won't be failing
till he actually grades mine.

08:08.821 --> 08:12.783
No, man, Grandmaster Gabe is cool.
He'll give me an extension.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.620
You had me at cool, lost me at extension.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.665
Come on, Mr. Iglesias, we all know
how much you wanna beat Poly. Right, guys?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.209
-[girl] Yeah.
-[boy] Come on.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.168
Look, of course.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.921
But school work comes first.
End of discussion.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.299
You gave me an extension on my FDR paper
when my mom was sick.

08:28.382 --> 08:31.385
And, full disclosure, my mom sleeps
at Uncle Roger's house when she's sick.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.560
Little too much disclosure, Mikey.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.439
Besides, I've given Rakeem extensions
on two other assignments.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.149
Football cannot be our only focus.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.194
Well, it-- it can this week, right?

08:48.277 --> 08:49.570
[Lorenzo] Yeah, come on.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.198
[all chanting] Let him play! Let him play!

08:52.281 --> 08:54.116
Let him play! Let him play!

08:54.200 --> 08:55.117
Fine, fine, fine,

08:55.201 --> 08:56.827
fine, fine. Look, Rakeem,
you can have another week.

08:56.911 --> 08:57.870
-[bell rings]
-Yeah!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.373
Yes. My man.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.416
Mm... Thank you.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.460
Thank you.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.045

09:08.923 --> 09:10.883
-[sighs]
-Well, well, well.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.261
Always looking forward to reading
your assignment, Marisol.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.680
You should. I worked hard on it.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.559
Really, really, really hard.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.021
You seem to be repeating yourself a lot.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.648
Do I?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.441
Do I?

09:28.818 --> 09:29.902
Do I?

09:33.614 --> 09:36.576
Look, you-- you like Rakeem.
We... We all like Rakeem.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.411
You know what I like more?

09:38.661 --> 09:41.414
A level playing field
where everyone is treated equal.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.085
Go, Bruins!

09:53.426 --> 09:56.178
[sighs] Hey, Tony. I tried your thing.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.222
Dancing like no one's watching?

10:01.517 --> 10:02.351
No.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.146
I let a kid slide in my class.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.524
-Oh. Yeah, pretty satisfying, right?
-Mm.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.067
-Hey, Gabriel.
-[Gabe] Yes, sir.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.404
We were just coaching up Abby here
on our football rivalry with Poly.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.322
Yeah.

10:14.405 --> 10:18.743
Wouldn't it be an even better rivalry
if we ever won? [chuckles]

10:23.164 --> 10:25.833
Iglesias, mi amigo.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.627
Heard what you did for Rocket,

10:27.710 --> 10:31.297
and I ordered the Spirit Squad
to buff your bus.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.302
That is not necessary or allowed.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.390
Well, they were more than happy
to help someone who's helping the cause.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.975
Barely had to raise my voice.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.436
Coach, just out of curiosity,

10:45.519 --> 10:47.938
what level do you think your voice is at
right now?

10:49.857 --> 10:51.567
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Paula.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.235
The other teachers
are cutting Rakeem some slack,

10:53.319 --> 10:56.113
but Gabe here is not having him do
a damn thing.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.032
Give that man a raise!

10:59.992 --> 11:02.870
Oh, no,
my tinnitus must be acting up again,

11:02.953 --> 11:05.247
'cause I didn't hear a damn word
the coach just said.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.459
Gotta get me some of that tinnitus.

11:09.418 --> 11:13.130
Look, all I wanna hear is the sound
of our fight song harmonizing

11:13.214 --> 11:15.758
with the wailing sobs
of those Poly chumps.

11:15.966 --> 11:19.762
Yeah. Sounds like sweet music to my ears.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.514
[chuckles]

11:21.722 --> 11:24.392
Look, you guys, we all want Rakeem
on the field this Friday,

11:24.475 --> 11:28.020
but what happens if we start caring more
about football than we do about teaching?

11:28.479 --> 11:29.939
We win the district title?

11:31.482 --> 11:32.608
I feel you, Gabe.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.445
You want it all: personality and knockers.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.327
But...
But you're never gonna get 'em both.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.624
In this situation,
football is the knockers.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.585
Everyone wants the knockers.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.466
That has been my experience.

12:01.762 --> 12:02.763
I don't know, guys,

12:02.847 --> 12:05.683
I kinda think schoolwork is the knockers.
[chuckles]

12:06.517 --> 12:10.354
Thanks, Abby. Uh, before HR gets here,
can we please stop saying "knockers"?

12:12.481 --> 12:13.566
Think about it, Gabriel.

12:13.941 --> 12:17.069
When we beat Poly,
our pride will be restored.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.530
And I'll be so proud of myself
for not betting,

12:19.613 --> 12:22.241
I probably won't even think about
how much money I could have won.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.161
Five hundred dollars.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.291
And my curriculum vitae will be complete.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.002
Paula, it's just us.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.587
You can say résumé.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.966
Look, is there anyone who thinks
I did the wrong thing

12:39.049 --> 12:40.718
by letting Rakeem slide on the rules?

12:41.051 --> 12:42.344
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.390
-Who?
-Those bitch-ass punks at Poly. [laughs]

12:48.058 --> 12:49.935
[chanting] Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!

12:50.019 --> 12:52.480
Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!

12:52.563 --> 12:54.648
[all] Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!

12:54.899 --> 12:57.067
Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!

12:59.445 --> 13:01.614
Hey, everybody, settle down. Settle down.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.408
Just a reminder,
your book reports are due Wednesday.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.368
Any Wednesday in particular? Or...?

13:07.411 --> 13:10.873
Yes. Uh, next Wednesday, in particular.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.293
Okay, so, uh, Walt's got his due date.
When's mine?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.923
Yeah, we kinda like the new
"whatever works for us" schedule.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.841
I'm thinking next Friday
would be good for me.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.552
[chuckles]
Look, you guys, that's not how this works.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.470
[scoffs]

13:25.304 --> 13:28.599
Where, oh where,
could they have gotten that idea?

13:29.767 --> 13:31.977
Look, I gave Rakeem an extension, okay?

13:32.061 --> 13:33.604
My rules haven't changed.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.482
Haven't they, though?

13:38.776 --> 13:39.777
Haven't they?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.113
Haven't they?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.827
Hey, Rakeem deserves an extension.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.288
He's differently abled! He runs a 4.5 40.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.209
Yeah, he's fast.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.920
He should be able to get his midterm
on my desk

13:58.003 --> 14:00.256
and make it back to his seat
without me even noticing.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.343
Thank you, Grace. You get it.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.178
Fan club president, huh?

14:06.762 --> 14:10.641
I'd prefer CEO of Licensing
and Distribution. [laughs]

14:11.392 --> 14:13.018
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

14:13.727 --> 14:17.273
Look, can anyone tell me
which judge opposed the majority

14:17.356 --> 14:18.524
in Plessy v. Ferguson?

14:19.817 --> 14:20.860
Not Marisol.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.196
Plessy?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.407
Oh, Ferguson.

14:29.785 --> 14:33.539
Look, okay, Justice Harlan was like me
against Lakewood.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.917
One man rolling against the tide.
[chuckles]

14:37.710 --> 14:39.086
Nerd alert! [scoffs]

14:41.630 --> 14:45.926
Except, unlike that fool Harlan, I won.
Hmm.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.554
-My man.
-[laughs]

14:49.930 --> 14:53.142
Hey, Rakeem, you didn't want to scribble
any of that on a piece of paper?

14:53.434 --> 14:55.769
Eh, that's... that's not really my thing.

14:57.187 --> 15:00.149
Look, Rakeem, if you let me help you,
we could have your midterm done today

15:00.232 --> 15:02.735
-like it was supposed to be.
-Oh, cool, cool, cool.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.863
So, you looking to join
the Rakeem Street Team, huh?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.991
What? No, no.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.118
No, I'm-- I'm looking to be the founder

15:11.201 --> 15:13.871
of the Restore Mr. Iglesias
Integrity Team.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.792
Good luck getting that on a T-shirt. 

15:20.210 --> 15:22.755
[laughs] Yeah, that team blows!

15:25.633 --> 15:29.219
Look, my integrity
has plenty of integrity, okay?

15:29.470 --> 15:31.597
Rakeem, that was a nice offer
Marisol made you.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.598
Why'd you spike it?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.851
Look, okay,
I'll get to that midterm when I get to it.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.896
But, Marisol,
if you want to throw on a crop top,

15:39.104 --> 15:42.608
I just might be able to get you
on the Spirit Squad, shorty. [chuckles]

15:44.318 --> 15:45.402
Hey, Rakeem,

15:45.778 --> 15:48.364
do you know why it's dangerous
for a receiver to go over the middle?

15:49.156 --> 15:51.283
Sure, I mean, he turns his head
to catch the ball,

15:51.367 --> 15:54.244
and he can get blown up by someone
much bigger than him.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.704
Good.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.667
'Cause you just went over the middle,
and I'm much bigger than you.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.421
Uh-oh.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.468
I'm not following this analogy at all.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.179
[whispering inaudibly]

16:12.346 --> 16:15.182
Look, Rakeem, you've been here long enough
to learn the two rules:

16:15.265 --> 16:16.642
work hard and be nice.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.143
Okay?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.647
Your extension's been revoked,
and until you turn in that midterm,

16:21.730 --> 16:24.817
you're failing this class,
which means you're not playing this week.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.904
-What?
-Mr. Iglesias!

16:29.154 --> 16:30.322
Did you forget?

16:30.698 --> 16:31.949
This week's the big game.

16:32.032 --> 16:35.327
Yeah, are-- are you smelling toast?
Are you stroking out? Like...

16:38.706 --> 16:39.623
Bench me instead!

16:39.707 --> 16:41.041
Yeah, bench me!

16:42.626 --> 16:44.128
Freakin' bench me!

16:44.461 --> 16:46.005
None of you play football.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.466
Bench the Rocket?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.969
[chuckles]

16:52.553 --> 16:54.096
That's hilarious. That's like--

16:54.179 --> 16:56.849
That's like benching Santa on Christmas.
[chuckles]

16:57.391 --> 16:59.184
Say hi to Krampus on campus.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.647
Ho-ho... no.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.155
[indistinct chatter]

17:21.540 --> 17:23.000
Hey, guys, what's up?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.299
[chuckles]

17:32.217 --> 17:35.971
This was supposed to be our year,
and now you're making us look silly.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.934
This coming from a grown man
in a bear costume?

17:42.728 --> 17:44.480
I think you got silly covered, bro.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.155
-Hey, bad news travels fast, right?
-Yeah.

17:53.363 --> 17:56.241
"Everybody hates Mr. Iglesias"
is already trending.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.535
Who started that?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.205
Huh? Uh, definitely not me.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.085
It was Chrissy Teigen. Chrissy Teigen.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.507
-Mr. Iglesias.
-Ugh.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.801
You did the right thing.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.304
You know, I never thought I'd see the day
where you were my only friend.

18:19.223 --> 18:23.435
[chuckles] No, I still don't like you,
but you did the right thing,

18:23.519 --> 18:26.480
and that forges
an unbreakable bond between us.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.107
I bet I can break it.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.073
[sighs] Hey, Paula.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.951
Oh, Gabe,

18:39.034 --> 18:41.036
you must feel terrible.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.789
Everyone's talking smack about you.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.836
All the students, every faculty member.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.672
All the alumni.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.343
People in the community, church groups.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.761
Look, I get it, okay?

18:58.178 --> 19:01.974
Well, they're all blaming you
for what's about to happen against Poly,

19:02.057 --> 19:03.350
and hating you for it.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.435
Didn't you want to add something
about admiring me

19:05.519 --> 19:08.897
-for standing up for what's right?
-No, I said what I wanted to say.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.699
Well, look who it is.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.534
Poly's double agent.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.080
Hey, man, I went to this school, okay?

19:25.164 --> 19:26.206
And I hated Poly

19:26.290 --> 19:28.500
long before you got canned
from that junior college

19:28.584 --> 19:29.877
for buying clean urine.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.174
First of all,
none of those dogs were harmed.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.931
Now, this is between you and me.

19:43.056 --> 19:44.266
Don't hurt the kid.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.936
Look, when he turns in that assignment,
he'll get his eligibility back.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.939
Iglesias, is this
because this is American football?

19:52.858 --> 19:55.110
Would you be more on board
if it was fútbol?

20:02.534 --> 20:06.496
Look, man, you better pump your brakes
before I put my foot in your balls.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.337
Goal!

20:17.299 --> 20:19.551
Do you even care about your kids' future?

20:20.135 --> 20:21.970
Do you think any of them are gonna go pro?

20:22.721 --> 20:23.722
Probably not.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.727
But if they learn what I teach,
they might make middle management

20:28.810 --> 20:31.021
at an Amazon Fulfillment Center.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.484
Which is, let's face it,
where most of these kids are ending up.

20:36.777 --> 20:37.861
I disagree.

20:37.945 --> 20:41.198
I want these kids to grow up
believing they can invent Amazon.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.662
Nice try.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.413
Already invented.

20:55.462 --> 20:59.549
-Finally, a friendly face.
-Dude, what the hell? You benched Rakeem?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.303
[clicks tongue] Okay, not so friendly.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.847
-How could you?
-[sighs]

21:05.931 --> 21:06.765
Wait...

21:07.432 --> 21:08.725
you got action on Poly?

21:10.727 --> 21:13.063
Look, I know this might seem weird
to the rest of you,

21:13.146 --> 21:14.815
but I'm just trying to be a good teacher.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.025
I warned you about trying.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.946
It always blows up in your face.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.907
Look, I was just trying to do
what everybody wanted.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.618
All right? Rakeem backed me into a corner.
[sighs]

21:26.702 --> 21:28.161
I just can't get through to him.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.540
Well, that's
because you treat him differently

21:31.623 --> 21:32.833
than all your other kids.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.419
-No, I don't.
-Of course you do.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.130
See, you see all of your other kids
as underdogs.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.882
Now you've finally got a winner,
you don't know what to do with him.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.177
Man, his head is just so big.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.057
Even Kanye's like, "Bro, dial it down."

21:52.686 --> 21:55.981
See, all your other kids remind you of us 
when we were in high school,

21:56.315 --> 21:57.524
so you fight for them.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.444
Rakeem reminds you of the kids
that used to pick on us.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.031
Yeah. He even looks like that kid
that stuffed you in a locker.

22:05.866 --> 22:09.911
What was his name?
I--Isai... Isaiah... Crawford.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.373
It wasn't so bad, though.
I actually had extra headroom.

22:15.584 --> 22:20.380
Look, you've never given up on a student. 
You shouldn't give up on Rakeem.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.091
When did you get so smart?

22:25.260 --> 22:27.429
You forget, I'm the honors teacher.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.018
And I probably heard something like that
on Dr. Phil.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.275
[grunting softly]

22:41.943 --> 22:43.362
Easy there, Mike Tyson.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.947
[panting] Mike Tyson?

22:46.323 --> 22:47.783
The actor from The Hangover?

22:49.576 --> 22:52.579
[imitates Tyson] "Hey, ese, I used to be
one of the best fighters in the world.

22:52.662 --> 22:53.955
They used to call me Iron Mike.

22:54.039 --> 22:57.459
Okay? And then I tattooed my face
and then I started playing with pigeons.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.212
Fly, pigeon, fly."

23:03.882 --> 23:06.593
Why are you here? Do you want to take away
my gym privileges, too?

23:06.676 --> 23:09.012
[in normal voice]
Hey, someone took away mine.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.056
It was me.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.893
I can't believe
you're not letting me play.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.978
Man, I was gonna run over those punks.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.939
I even had a new touchdown dance.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.608
Everybody was gonna be doing the "Rakeem."

23:21.942 --> 23:24.236
One part Kiki, two parts stanky leg.

23:24.444 --> 23:27.823
♪ Do the Rakeem, do the Rakeem
Do, do the Rakeem ♪

23:27.906 --> 23:30.742
♪ Back it up, oh
Back it up, hey, hey ♪

23:31.993 --> 23:32.869
I like it.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.663
Yeah,
I would have flipped the ratios, though.

23:34.746 --> 23:38.166
I would have done, uh, two part Kiki,
one part stanky leg, so...

23:38.417 --> 23:40.210
two part Kiki and then a stanky leg.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.503
-Yeah.
-You like that?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.296
-Like... Yeah, that's...
-Yeah.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.049
-That's pretty good, man.
-Yeah, I do yoga.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.427
No, okay, but I'm still mad at you.

23:48.802 --> 23:52.264
Ah, join the club.
Yeah, even I've got problems with me.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.891
Personal demons, but I digress.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.895
So, uh,
how long you been hitting that bag?

23:59.396 --> 24:01.022
-[sighs] Almost an hour.
-[Gabe] Hmm.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.359
But if you feel like sparring,
I'm sure I can go another round.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.779
An hour? You know, Rakeem,
if you can work this hard in here,

24:07.863 --> 24:09.364
you can work this hard in my classroom.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.657
Man, I know that.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.617
That's an hour
I'm not working on football.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.995
-[Gabe] Hmm.
-Which is the only thing I'm great at.

24:15.495 --> 24:18.457
Coach tells us, when you find
what you do well, stay in that lane.

24:18.623 --> 24:22.043
That's strange advice coming from someone
who swerves all over the faculty lounge.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.798
I know everyone around here wants
to define you as just a running back.

24:27.174 --> 24:30.302
[scoffs] I don't mind.
Have you ever been a star running back?

24:30.510 --> 24:31.928
[sighs] It's pretty awesome.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.142
I'm sure it is.
I believe you're more than that,

24:37.476 --> 24:39.186
and I want you to believe it, too.

24:39.811 --> 24:43.023
You knew all about Justice Harlan,
but you think it's off-brand for you,

24:43.106 --> 24:44.024
so you shut it down.

24:44.608 --> 24:48.987
[scoffs] Man. Harlan, he was a badass.
He didn't stay in his lane.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.113
Uh-uh.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.366
You saying
I should get outta my lane, too.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.284
Yes, I do.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.705
Damn, Mr. Iglesias.
Why do you care so much?

24:59.080 --> 25:00.916
Because that's my lane.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.669
[chuckles] It's what I'm good at.
That and Ms. Pac-Man.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.297
[imitates Ms. Pac-Man gobbling]

25:08.006 --> 25:10.008
[imitates game over sound]

25:11.801 --> 25:12.802
No?

25:13.053 --> 25:13.970
Google.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.890
So how we gonna do this
before tomorrow's game?

25:16.973 --> 25:18.642
[as Tyson] Simple,
we're gonna bite the dog ears

25:18.725 --> 25:19.601
off those books.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.394
We're gonna go 12 rounds
with American History.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.188
Fly, pigeon, fly.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.234
-My man.
-[in normal voice] Yeah. [laughs]

25:28.026 --> 25:29.945
[both grunting]

25:31.530 --> 25:33.365
[both imitate pigeon cooing]

25:36.076 --> 25:37.911
[crowd chanting] Bruins! Bruins!

25:37.994 --> 25:40.747
Bruins! Bruins! Bruins!

25:40.830 --> 25:42.791
Bruins! Bruins!

25:42.874 --> 25:45.085
Go, Wilson! Go, Wilson!

25:45.168 --> 25:46.461
[all chanting] Go, Wilson!

25:46.545 --> 25:49.881
Please keep the aisles clear!
Don't make me call the fire marshal!

25:50.757 --> 25:52.968
Or do, I'd love to call the fire marshal.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.054
You don't have to call him.
He's right there.

25:59.307 --> 26:05.814
And I'd to congratulate Coach Dixon
and his squad for whipping Poly's butt!

26:06.314 --> 26:08.024
[crowd cheers]

26:08.108 --> 26:09.776
Coach Dixon!

26:14.197 --> 26:16.491
I'd like to give away a couple game balls.

26:16.575 --> 26:20.287
First, to my guy, give it up for Rakeem!

26:20.829 --> 26:25.041
[crowd cheers and whoops]

26:27.502 --> 26:28.795
'Keem!

26:28.878 --> 26:32.299
And another to someone who taught me
a valuable lesson this last week.

26:33.049 --> 26:36.219
Well, you know,
I think we all learned a very valuable--

26:36.303 --> 26:37.220
Grace Lee!

26:39.598 --> 26:42.183
That direct snap through Keem 
on third down with a minute left?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.310
Grace's idea.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.813
So suck it, Poly!

26:46.896 --> 26:50.233
[whoops] Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!

26:50.317 --> 26:54.696
Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!
Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!

26:54.779 --> 26:57.949
[all chanting] Go, Rocket! Go, Rocket!
Go, Rocket!

26:59.492 --> 27:01.911
