01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:09.273
Come on.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.807
Mom, hurry!

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:13.043
Hurry!

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.984
Mom, come on. Hurry up!

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.325
Mom, are you okay?

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.763
What exactly is that?

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.366
Spider, man.

01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:40.203
Hey...

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:41.770
Hey, Chris, how'sthe lockdown holding

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.838
over there?

01:05:42.839 --> 01:05:44.373
This one's holdingpretty good.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:46.576
They're holding, but we
don't have much time.

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:49.278
Okay.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:50.779
All the doors arelocked and secured.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.081
No breaches at the front.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:54.017
I haven't heard a soundin a couple hours.

01:05:54.018 --> 01:05:55.284
I think the doors will hold.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.220
Someone ought toget back there and...

01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:58.354
Go.

01:05:58.355 --> 01:05:59.755
Sam,

01:05:59.756 --> 01:06:02.891
I think we have a right to knowwhat
the hell is going on here.

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.927
Those thingskilled Leroy.

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:06.929
And Bob Miller, my best customer,

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:08.731
was hangingfrom my ceiling.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:10.666
What am I doingon the radio all day?

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.768
I've been telling youabout
the alien invasion

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:13.802
for months.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.038
Am I talking to myself?

01:06:15.039 --> 01:06:17.373
I'm here for you.

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:19.108
You saying thosethings out there

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:20.577
are aliens?

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.979
Mom, they have tobe quiet.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.248
Those weren't aliens.

01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:27.050
Those werebig-ass spiders,

01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:28.084
really big ones!

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:30.419
Shut up.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.522
Let's listen to the kidfor once.

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.025
Go on, Mike.

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:39.862
All right.

01:06:39.863 --> 01:06:41.130
First of all,

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:42.798
the spiders are attractedto vibrations.

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:46.702
That includes loud noises,
movement, and talking,

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:51.740
so everybody just needs to stayas
calm and quiet as possible.

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.809
Sam, why didn't youcall in the Army,

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:55.078
for chrissake?

01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:56.912
Where have you been, Wade?

01:06:56.913 --> 01:06:58.481
The phones are dead.

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.883
Doesn't anyonehave a
cell phone around here?

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:03.252
You can use mine, if you'rewilling
to climb a mountain.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:05.088
Why don't youjust use the antenna

01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:06.755
up on the topof the mall?

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.557
That's how I getmy broadcast out.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:10.426
Have somebody climb upand get a signal out.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:11.994
That's a great idea, Harlan.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.430
Be a hero.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.633
I'll do it.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:19.168
No, Sam, let me.

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:20.804
I've got your back.

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:23.240
Great.

01:07:23.241 --> 01:07:24.773
I've been fightingthese aliens

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:26.041
my whole life.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.943
About timel busted up a few of them

01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:29.912
face to face.

01:07:29.913 --> 01:07:31.180
They're not aliens,

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:32.415
they're spiders!

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.782
Those of you whodon't have weapons

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.318
need to arm yourselves

01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:37.320
with anythingthat you can dig up,

01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.455
and then we'll all meetright back here.

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:40.656
Okay?

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.991
Go to the hardware storeand meet me here.

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:45.194
Norman...

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.929
show me the wayto the roof.

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.264
I'm sorry. Show you where?

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:49.265
The roof, Norman.

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:50.599
The roof!

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.801
The roof.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.634
How is it looking?

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:27.035
Roof's clear.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.636
Be careful, Chris.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:31.174
Thanks, Sam.

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:32.941
Listen, I've been tryingto
say something to you,

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.144
so I'll just come outand say it.

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:36.279
Okay.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.313
Here, take these.

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:38.581
You'll need them.

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:39.515
Perfume?

01:08:39.517 --> 01:08:40.582
Spiders,

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:42.318
they have a highly developedsense of smell.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.919
The perfumecould confuse them.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.188
Oh, great, you know,

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:47.756
if we die, we diesmelling nice.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:50.460
Nobody's dying, okay?

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:09.612
That's the one

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:10.845

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.456

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:41.470
That's great.

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:44.307
Now how about dialing?

01:10:44.308 --> 01:10:45.841

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:48.411

I swear it's the truth.

Our town is being attackedby giant spiders.

01:10:57.387 --> 01:11:00.122
We need military intervention.

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:02.090
This is an emergency
service, not Dial-a-Joke.

Through that door

01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:30.653

Centerand the Cinemaplex?

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:39.501
All right, let's move.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:40.535
Come on!

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:41.570
Let's go, everybody.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.874
Into the mines. Come on, hurry.

01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:48.310
There's got to be flashlightsor something.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:50.645
Keep moving.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:51.813
Grab one of these.

01:20:51.814 --> 01:20:55.017
Oh, cool, a miner's helmet.

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:56.619
I always wanted to try one.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.125
Chris?

01:21:03.126 --> 01:21:04.960
Can you leadthese people out?

01:21:04.961 --> 01:21:07.163
Come on, everybody, let's go.

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:20.609
This should hold him...

01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:27.682
I hope.

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:29.317
Chris?

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:31.219
How do we getout of here?

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.055
We follow these power linesto a generator.

01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:35.790
The generatorsare always near an exit.

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.225
Hurry.

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:38.260
Come on, everybody.

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:39.594
Not that way, this way.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:40.862
This way.

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:42.265
Follow the kid.

01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:45.567
Hurry up.

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:47.535
You went back therefor that?

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:48.803
God, lose that thing.

01:21:48.804 --> 01:21:50.205
It's going toslow us down.

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:51.906
You wouldn't believehow many times

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.376
this puppy saved my ass.

01:21:57.813 --> 01:21:59.414
What's that smell?

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.716
Wasn't me.

01:22:01.717 --> 01:22:03.618
Methane gas, a lot of it.

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:04.953
Listen up.

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:06.821
The slightest sparkor an open flame

01:22:06.822 --> 01:22:08.391
can blow us all to hell...

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:12.027
so be careful.

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:13.395
Let's go.

01:22:13.396 --> 01:22:16.598
The cables lead to a generator.

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:17.967
Follow the cables.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.035
Cables...

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:21.637
to a generator.

01:22:24.007 --> 01:22:26.575
You guys, it's this way.

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:32.147
Follow the cables.

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:34.682
The cables lead to a generator.

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:37.253
Follow the cables.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:22:59.841
Norman!

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:02.445
Somebody save him!

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.782
No. No, no. No gunfire.

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:08.950
No gunfire.

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:10.653
We'll set off the gas.

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:16.225
Catch.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:27.535
All right, come on, everybody, hurry,

01:23:27.536 --> 01:23:28.903
into the tunnel.

01:23:28.904 --> 01:23:30.506
Follow the cables.

01:23:36.779 --> 01:23:38.680
People, hold on.

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:40.416
What the hell is this?

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:43.851
What's going on?

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.087
I don't know.

01:23:45.088 --> 01:23:46.588
That spider back there,

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:48.090
was that the female?

01:23:48.091 --> 01:23:49.624
No.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.593
That was justanother male.

01:23:51.594 --> 01:23:54.163
The femaleis three times as big.

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:58.366
So she's probablystill close by, right?

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.302
Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so.

01:24:00.303 --> 01:24:02.204
Mike, go backwith your sister.

01:24:02.205 --> 01:24:03.805
Go back with your sister!

01:24:03.806 --> 01:24:05.274
Go.

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.312
What are you doing here?

01:24:10.313 --> 01:24:11.513
Mom sent me back.

01:24:11.514 --> 01:24:12.315
Why?

01:24:12.316 --> 01:24:13.782
You don't want to know.

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:19.854
We have to do it.

01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:21.856
It's the only way out.

01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:24.159
Okay.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.396
Oh, my God...

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.666
What the hell?

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.609
What is it?

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.680
I think it's alive.

01:24:49.652 --> 01:24:51.986
Don't touch it.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:53.189
Don't, don't...

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.231
It's Wade.

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:04.332
It's Wade.

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:05.767
Bret, just go, okay?

01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:06.768
Just go.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.703

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.306
Let's get him down.

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:16.911
Oops.

01:25:16.912 --> 01:25:18.481

01:25:19.882 --> 01:25:21.048
I don't feel so hot.

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:22.351
Hold on a second.

01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:44.873
Wow, look at the size of that.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.349
What the hellis this place, Mike?

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:57.285
It looks likean orb weaver den.

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:59.221
Okay, Chris, get usout of here fast.

01:25:59.222 --> 01:26:00.522
Sam, I can't.

01:26:00.523 --> 01:26:01.523
Why not?

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:03.958
Is there a chanceGladys is still alive?

01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:06.127
Well, it's possible.

01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:07.629
Are you crazy?

01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.364
Sam, you'll have toget out without me.

01:26:09.365 --> 01:26:11.098
Keep followingthose wires.

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:12.834
There's a wooden shedon the outside

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:14.168

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.903

What are you up to?

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:18.941
I've got an idea.

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:24.312
I get it.

01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:25.980
All right, everybody, come on.

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:27.081

Let's go. This way.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.116
Come on, Mark.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.286
Bret, I need your bike.

01:26:31.287 --> 01:26:32.887
Bret, just do it.

01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:34.088
All right, kids, come on.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.591
Just leave it there.

01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:38.760
I've tried to tell you thisfor a long time.

01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:40.328
Now?

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:42.897
I may not get another chance.

01:26:42.898 --> 01:26:45.199
I should have said thisa long time ago.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.368
I know.

01:26:46.369 --> 01:26:47.702
You beat up my ex

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:49.404
because you found outhe was cheating on me,

01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:50.838
and you couldn't tell me,

01:26:50.839 --> 01:26:52.507
because you didn't want
tobreak up my family,

01:26:52.508 --> 01:26:54.208
and you love me, you've always love me,

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.510
and if you'd told me sooner,

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:57.144
maybe our liveswould be different.

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:59.080
Exactly.

01:26:59.081 --> 01:27:01.148
Your father told me.

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:02.984
My dad told you?

01:27:02.985 --> 01:27:06.221
Yes. Now get moving, so you
canmake it up to me later.

01:27:07.523 --> 01:27:08.557
Go on.

that dragged that barrelout of the water.

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:57.598
I got completely coveredin the stuff.

01:33:57.599 --> 01:33:59.066
And your point is?

01:33:59.067 --> 01:34:00.267
Point?

01:34:00.268 --> 01:34:01.703
See this?

01:34:01.704 --> 01:34:03.304
All brand-new. Brand-new growth.

01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:04.571
Check it out, people,

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:06.507
brand-new.

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:08.509
Ma'am, are you all right?

01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:10.111
Do you smoke?

01:34:10.112 --> 01:34:11.478
No.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.914
Good.

01:34:12.915 --> 01:34:15.582
Dangerous habit.Disgusting.

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:16.518
Causes explosions.

01:34:16.519 --> 01:34:17.819
Wish I'd never started.

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.321
Are there any more
peopledown in those mines?

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:21.588
No. My Aunt Gladys

01:34:21.589 --> 01:34:23.124
was the only onel found alive.

01:34:23.125 --> 01:34:24.726
I checkedthe other cocoons,

01:34:24.727 --> 01:34:26.193
but nobody made it.

01:34:26.194 --> 01:34:27.194
Cocoons?

01:34:27.195 --> 01:34:29.130
Hey, guys, we've got cocoons!

01:34:29.131 --> 01:34:30.865
I told you it'dbe worth the ride!

01:34:30.866 --> 01:34:32.935
Glad you came back home?

01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:36.370
Yeah.

01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:38.605
Yeah, I am.

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:40.407
Me too.

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:42.243
And that, my friends, is the story

01:34:42.244 --> 01:34:44.011
of how the aliens attacked
our sleepy little town,

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.412
and to this day,

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.148
people refuseto believe the truth

01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:48.750
about what happened here.

01:34:48.751 --> 01:34:50.752
They'd lead you to believel
would embellish this story,

01:34:50.753 --> 01:34:52.353
that I would make it up,

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:54.621
but we know the truth.

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.023
Oh yeah,

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:58.025
two thingsl forgot to tell you...

01:34:58.026 --> 01:35:02.363
One, they never didget that probe near me.

01:35:02.364 --> 01:35:03.697
And two,

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:07.334
as far as Chris
McCormickreopening the gold mines

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:11.205
and putting everyoneback to work,

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:15.911
well, that, my friends, is
another story altogether.
