00:58.809 --> 01:00.475
Damn! Are y'all seeing this?!

01:00.477 --> 01:02.778
- Hey, my cartoon's on.
- Oh, my lord.

01:03.008 --> 01:04.541
Hey, dummy, my cartoon's on.

01:04.543 --> 01:06.509
Look at all the devastation.

01:06.511 --> 01:07.343
The [bleep] bitch!

01:07.345 --> 01:09.479
- Dang.
- Now we gonna change this or what?

01:09.481 --> 01:10.713
You whore!

01:10.715 --> 01:14.133
Is that that guy that
rented our house? Paul?

01:21.948 --> 01:23.219
Hey, my cartoon is on.

01:23.295 --> 01:25.184
Now you're still worked out here,
remember?!

01:26.115 --> 01:27.747
Not anymore! Ha ha!

01:27.825 --> 01:30.656
He looks like he's doing something
different with his hair.

01:30.662 --> 01:33.163
Let me show you something.

01:33.167 --> 01:35.834
Project Fightan, the
Fightin' Titan.

01:35.870 --> 01:39.138
Classified for over 20 years,
these blueprints were discovered

01:39.140 --> 01:40.873
in the antarctic wasteland by a

01:40.875 --> 01:44.377
team of weather scientists,
frozen in a block of ice

01:44.379 --> 01:47.947
300 miles thick, written
in alien sanskrit.

01:47.949 --> 01:53.252
Linguists could only decipher
two words: "Stop Paul."

01:53.254 --> 01:55.254
Man, you did the
narration on this, too?

01:55.256 --> 01:57.089
You're popping an
awful lot of P's.

01:57.091 --> 01:58.224
You got to watch that.

01:58.226 --> 01:59.425
Not P-a-a-u-u-l.

01:59.427 --> 02:00.993
- Paul.
- Shh!

02:00.995 --> 02:03.296
You know, I had a lot of
P's in "Open Season 3"...

02:03.298 --> 02:04.764
straight to video.

02:04.779 --> 02:07.446
They couldn't get my work into
the marketplace fast enough.

02:07.506 --> 02:08.906
Quiet, man!
This is the best part.

02:08.987 --> 02:11.888
A giant robot, equipped
with laser-guided lasers,

02:11.890 --> 02:14.423
flamethrower nose, and
twin booby cannons.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.092
According to this unknown alien

02:16.094 --> 02:19.762
source, this giant robot is
the only thing that can...

02:19.764 --> 02:22.331
Stop Paul.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.300
Well, that's a cool video.
What else is on?

02:24.302 --> 02:26.302
This ain't no video, Shake.
It exists.

02:26.306 --> 02:27.405
I know.

02:27.407 --> 02:30.241
But do you have other videos?

02:38.129 --> 02:41.119
It's not a playground. You said
you was building me a playground.

02:41.121 --> 02:43.254
- That's right. You did!
- Well, I wasn't.

02:43.256 --> 02:45.089
And this slide is no fun.

02:45.091 --> 02:47.825
Look, I didn't want to
alarm you guys, okay?

02:47.827 --> 02:49.260
But I knew this day would come.

02:49.262 --> 02:50.161
Looks broken.

02:50.163 --> 02:51.529
It comes in pieces, Shake.

02:51.531 --> 02:54.432
It's a sophisticated piece
of joining-robot technology.

02:54.434 --> 02:57.936
So that's kind of why I need
other people to help operate it.

02:57.938 --> 02:59.938
- Ooh! I call the head!
- No! I'm the head!

02:59.996 --> 03:01.962
I'm the loudest person
that I've ever met.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.999
It's only natural I'd be in the head of
the robot, right where the mouth is.

03:05.001 --> 03:07.401
But the foot is just as
important as the head.

03:07.403 --> 03:09.336
The foot kicks stuff,
smashes stuff.

03:09.338 --> 03:12.706
The foot is where it's at, man. But
that would mean I'd have to walk.

03:12.732 --> 03:13.998
I want to be the heinie.

03:14.065 --> 03:15.731
'Cause that's where
the booty shakes.

03:15.733 --> 03:19.802
You can be up in the head with me
and you can work the mustache.

03:19.804 --> 03:21.504
You are the mustache master.

03:21.529 --> 03:25.131
Second some kid breaks his
neck going down that slide,

03:25.133 --> 03:27.433
I'm gonna be there, laughing.

03:27.435 --> 03:30.069
Hey, Carl, you have anything
going on this afternoon?

03:30.071 --> 03:32.671
Eh. I'm pretty slammed.

03:35.176 --> 03:40.312
You think maybe you could find, uh, about
15 minutes to help us out with this, uh...

03:40.314 --> 03:41.380
Man, this is hard to explain.

03:41.382 --> 03:44.383
No, you want me to run the arms for
the giant robot. Yeah, I got that.

03:44.385 --> 03:46.118
Yeah! Yes, exactly!

03:46.120 --> 03:47.186
Wait a minute.

03:47.188 --> 03:49.088
- What the...
- Where are the arms?!

03:49.090 --> 03:51.157
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

03:51.159 --> 03:52.925
There we go, kitty.

03:52.927 --> 03:55.094
Are you an itchy kitty?

03:55.096 --> 03:56.128
Yes, you...

03:56.130 --> 03:57.596
No, no, no, don't do that!

03:57.598 --> 03:59.807
CPR program, go!

04:01.169 --> 04:04.070
No! No CPR! Stop the CPR!

04:04.072 --> 04:06.038
Where's the dong on this thing?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.340
- I want to run the dong.
- It doesn't have no dong, man.

04:08.342 --> 04:09.942
Well, why doesn't
it have a dong?

04:09.944 --> 04:12.311
- Yeah, Frylock.
- Look, there's no need for a dong!

04:12.313 --> 04:13.446
What about pleasure?

04:13.448 --> 04:14.346
Can it, like, drink?

04:14.348 --> 04:16.682
Robots gets pleasure
from a job well done.

04:17.685 --> 04:20.719
A <i>hand</i> job or a <i>blow</i> job?

04:20.721 --> 04:24.290
'Cause I get some serious pleasure
when them jobs are well done!

04:25.326 --> 04:28.294
I'm sorry, Carl, but it
does not have a dong.

04:28.296 --> 04:30.496
Give it a dong and we'll talk.

04:30.498 --> 04:32.965
'Cause I ain't riding
in no woman robot.

04:32.967 --> 04:35.234
They're inferior. That's
why we pay them less.

04:35.236 --> 04:37.203
Look, it's not
gender-specific, man!

04:37.205 --> 04:40.402
Well, then it's a shemale, 'cause you
give it some double-d's over there.

04:40.408 --> 04:41.707
Yeah, those are boobs!

04:41.709 --> 04:43.576
Booby-cannons, yes, of course.

04:43.578 --> 04:44.677
But that's weaponry.

04:44.679 --> 04:46.145
Make 'em bounce.

04:46.147 --> 04:47.379
Make 'em go up and down.

04:47.381 --> 04:49.313
You whore!

04:51.285 --> 04:54.520
This is where I proposed to you!
Ha!

04:54.522 --> 04:56.689
Now it's dust. Bitch!

04:56.691 --> 04:58.024
Look, we're running out of time.

04:58.096 --> 05:00.763
Let's just connect and see if we can
find Meatwad with the damn arms.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.333
I thought this was
a solo mission...

05:02.335 --> 05:03.968
For the iron boot of justice.

05:05.076 --> 05:07.417
We have to connect. Otherwise,
the damn thing won't work.

05:07.444 --> 05:09.611
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
my hands are tied.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.513
I can no longer be involved with

05:11.515 --> 05:14.449
the project until you bring
it up to spec, crotch-wise.

05:14.451 --> 05:17.018
Fine! I'll weld
on a dong, okay?!

05:17.020 --> 05:18.787
Yeah! Tonight!

05:18.789 --> 05:21.156
Hey, I'm gonna take
this for a test-spin!

05:21.254 --> 05:23.041
- Wait. Where you going?!
- I'll be back.

05:26.983 --> 05:28.015
Hey, buddy!

05:28.117 --> 05:31.418
You need to park whatever
that is outside.

05:31.420 --> 05:33.530
You're smashing out
all our floor lights.

05:33.531 --> 05:36.907
How'd you like it if I deposit
this giant copper foot

05:36.909 --> 05:40.911
so far up your fat ass that you'll
be tasting pennies for a week?

05:40.913 --> 05:43.914
What the hell happened to you?
And where's the foot?

05:43.916 --> 05:45.883
- I lost it.
- What do you mean
you lost the foot?!

05:45.920 --> 05:49.555
I got jumped by a street gang when I
was field-testing it, which is when

05:49.644 --> 05:53.712
I conveniently found out that
the bunion rays do not work!

05:53.741 --> 05:57.842
So I say we combine right now
and smush that guy into liquid!

05:57.930 --> 05:58.863
- Guy?
- You with me?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.860
You said it was a gang, and...

06:00.954 --> 06:02.654
You smell like gin and
smoke-machine oil!

06:02.762 --> 06:04.629
There's no way you can
smell that on me.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.564
You went to the damn
disco, didn't you?

06:06.566 --> 06:10.801
I heard screams coming from
inside a disco-type place,
and I went in to investigate.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.336
Aw, hell to the no!

06:12.338 --> 06:14.305
- And you would have done
the same exact thing!
- No, I wouldn't.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.241
- I told you I was the head!
- No, I'm the head,
because the head is the...

06:17.243 --> 06:19.710
I should have been the head or
this never would have happened!

06:19.712 --> 06:23.080
I know! 'Cause you'd have
took the head to the club
then that'd be missing, too!

06:23.082 --> 06:25.783
Just want to make sure that
we're all on the same page,

06:25.785 --> 06:28.319
- that that needs to be bigger.
- I know, Carl! Damn it!

06:28.321 --> 06:30.354
I know. I just... I
just want you to know.

06:30.356 --> 06:33.024
- I ain't no good at doin' this.
- What happened to you?

06:33.106 --> 06:35.740
I had an itch, but I
didn't pick my nose.

06:35.746 --> 06:38.647
I had an itch. Then I
scratched it wrong.

06:38.649 --> 06:42.851
And then I smushed three kitties
and a schnauzer and I helped

06:42.853 --> 06:44.953
an old lady across the street...

06:44.955 --> 06:47.022
like 3 miles across the street.

06:47.024 --> 06:50.125
I think, like, she in the ocean.

06:50.127 --> 06:51.778
Oh, my word.

06:54.131 --> 06:56.265
Have a good day now!

06:57.868 --> 07:00.769
Oh. I got to get me a boogie.

07:00.771 --> 07:04.006
Pick boogie... initiate.

07:04.008 --> 07:08.377
So, anyways, I'm thinkin' I want to
be the mustache again. Can I do that?

07:08.379 --> 07:12.347
Well, I got a news flash for y'all. We
ain't going no place without a foot.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.716
- Unless...
- Unless what?

07:14.718 --> 07:16.985
Unless you want to drive?

07:16.987 --> 07:19.087
- All right, I'll do it.
- Really?

07:19.089 --> 07:21.089
But we got to make
a side trip...

07:21.091 --> 07:22.324
to Boston.

07:24.995 --> 07:27.129
Yeah, that's right!

07:27.131 --> 07:28.563
Chomp down on that!

07:29.333 --> 07:33.402
Hey, Carl, last call for alcohol.
I know how much you like it.

07:33.404 --> 07:37.406
See if they'll sell you 12.
They cut it off after 17.

07:37.408 --> 07:39.341
Yeah!

07:39.343 --> 07:41.910
I'm a robot!

07:41.912 --> 07:44.179
That was totally worth it.
Wasn't that a rush?

07:44.181 --> 07:46.181
You think you got
home field advantage?

07:46.183 --> 07:47.983
No. It's an away game...

07:47.985 --> 07:50.285
When the giant robot is in town.

07:52.489 --> 07:54.089
Ahh. So where we goin'?

07:54.091 --> 07:55.958
You see that cloud of rubble?

07:55.960 --> 07:58.828
- You hear those shrieks?
- To the, uh...

07:58.918 --> 08:01.785
the big-ass monster there eating
all them skyscrapers, there?

08:01.857 --> 08:05.087
I hope you die with the devil's
dick in your mouth in hell!

08:05.093 --> 08:07.260
Oh, man, we're about
to hit the rush hour.

08:07.262 --> 08:08.862
Let me just drop you
off right here.

08:08.864 --> 08:09.896
Wait, Carl...

08:09.898 --> 08:12.132
It's a little bit of a walk,
but you'll get there.

08:12.134 --> 08:14.034
I-I need you to run
the torso, man.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.903
- I don't want to be a third wheel here.
- Carl! Carl!

08:16.905 --> 08:19.005
Hit me on my cell if you
need anything, okay?

08:19.007 --> 08:20.474
Carl!

08:21.243 --> 08:22.909
Oh, man, he bailed, didn't he?

08:22.911 --> 08:23.944
We're screwed.

08:23.946 --> 08:25.446
- That's it. Game over, man.
- No, no.

08:25.534 --> 08:26.633
You run the head.

08:26.635 --> 08:30.303
- Meatwad and I will man the mustache.
- There ain't no damn mustache, Shake!

08:30.305 --> 08:32.772
- No mustache?
- He'll recognize us!

08:32.782 --> 08:36.116
We need to push this back
until later in the summer.
He'll forget by then.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.011
No, we're gonna face the
music with what we have.

08:39.014 --> 08:43.149
Meatwad, Shake... man the arms.

08:43.150 --> 08:45.051
Is this enough space
for you, honey?!

08:45.053 --> 08:46.820
Paul! Paul!

08:46.822 --> 08:50.190
Calm down! It's okay!

08:50.192 --> 08:52.292
Who the "f" are you?!

08:52.348 --> 08:53.413
Wow. Language.

08:53.415 --> 08:56.550
I'm just concerned about you, man.
Want to talk about it?

08:56.552 --> 08:59.286
- She said I was dumb and ugly!
- No, Paul.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.589
- You smart and you good-looking.
- That's right, that's right.

09:02.591 --> 09:06.160
Good-looking people get ahead in life
'cause they're tall and good-looking.

09:06.233 --> 09:07.332
Plus, you're white.

09:07.334 --> 09:09.567
- White people get everything.
- Shut up, Shake!

09:09.569 --> 09:11.703
- Seen TV lately?
- Shake, shut up!

09:11.705 --> 09:14.339
Thousands of white
people and Beyoncé.

09:14.341 --> 09:16.040
- She lied!
- Paul.

09:16.042 --> 09:17.575
- To me!
- Settle down, man.

09:17.577 --> 09:19.644
I'll bet it's just a
misunderstanding.

09:19.646 --> 09:23.581
Come on, sit down.
I'm here for you.

09:23.583 --> 09:26.751
- Well, I'm with her, getting ice cream.
- Mm-hmm.

09:26.753 --> 09:30.121
And dad is there, and I love my
dad, but he's always with us.

09:30.123 --> 09:31.222
Oh, yeah.

09:31.224 --> 09:34.225
And it's weird because he shows
up, and I never mentioned

09:34.227 --> 09:37.595
- where we were gonna be,
but somehow he knew, right?
- Okay.

09:37.597 --> 09:40.398
So then she says, out of
nowhere, "I have to go to the

09:40.400 --> 09:42.267
car to check the
air in the tires."

09:42.269 --> 09:44.302
So I'm like, "okay,
that's responsible."

09:44.304 --> 09:45.303
Uh-huh.

09:45.305 --> 09:46.671
And then dad says he has to

09:46.673 --> 09:49.707
go to his car to get his shades,
and so I'm like, "Cool. Get back

09:49.709 --> 09:53.178
- soon, 'cause your ice
cream's gonna melt."
- Go ahead.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.280
And like two hours pass,
so I'm like, "what gives?"

09:55.282 --> 09:57.215
- And I go to the parking lot...
- Okay.

09:57.217 --> 09:59.651
...and they're in my car, and they
act all weird when I show up.

09:59.653 --> 10:01.753
And she puts her shirt on real
quick, and she's in his lap, and

10:01.755 --> 10:03.488
- I'm like, "what's going on?"
- Yeah.

10:03.490 --> 10:07.058
And they're all like, "he's just
a friend, and why can't I can be
friends with your father?"

10:07.060 --> 10:08.793
And I'm like, "well, what's his
dick doing in your hands?!"

10:08.795 --> 10:10.562
She's just trying to
get your attention.

10:10.564 --> 10:12.297
She cares about you, man.

10:12.322 --> 10:13.554
I know. I know she does.

10:13.556 --> 10:17.291
But they left me there, and they knew I
didn't have money for the ice cream.

10:17.293 --> 10:20.695
- That's weird, right?
- I'm sure her hand slipped, Paul.

10:20.697 --> 10:22.563
Hmm. That's what they said.

10:22.565 --> 10:25.866
I just... I just always feel like
people are lying to me and using me...

10:25.868 --> 10:27.668
Hit the booby cannons.

10:28.371 --> 10:30.471
- What's that?
- Oh, nothing.

10:30.473 --> 10:32.240
Good. 'Cause I... I thought
you said "hit the booby

10:32.297 --> 10:34.776
cannons," and that would've
made me awful mad.

10:34.827 --> 10:36.193
No, I didn't say nothin'.

10:36.289 --> 10:38.256
So, what else happened on
your little ice-cream trip?

10:38.258 --> 10:40.324
Wait, wait. Hang on. I got
booby cannons charging.

10:40.326 --> 10:42.626
Why are you charging
up booby cannons?

10:42.702 --> 10:44.869
- You really want to know?
- Why did he say that?

10:45.006 --> 10:47.473
Shake, the man is dealing with
a lot of pain right now, okay?

10:47.532 --> 10:49.031
So let's not talk about
what we're doing.

10:49.076 --> 10:51.143
He's gonna be dealing with a
lot more pain in about...

10:51.156 --> 10:54.625
45 minutes to charge?!
Oh, my God!

10:54.627 --> 10:57.661
Paul, tell me more
about your girlfriend.

10:57.663 --> 10:58.862
She's really hot.

10:58.864 --> 11:02.966
She dresses like a slut all the time,
especially when my dad's around.

11:02.968 --> 11:04.668
And I'm like, "You can
wear that to work?"

11:04.670 --> 11:06.637
And she's like, "yeah," and
I'm like, "okay, well..."

11:06.639 --> 11:10.140
Hey, yeah, jealousy can make
you crazy, you know?
Where we at, Shake?

11:10.142 --> 11:12.843
You don't even want to know. 3%.

11:13.913 --> 11:16.113
And then I go to my dad's, and
her car's parked there, and

11:16.115 --> 11:17.748
it turns out she's
not at work at all!

11:17.750 --> 11:21.051
Maybe she quit her job so she and your
dad could plan a surprise party for you.

11:21.053 --> 11:23.420
Weird. That is exactly
what she said.

11:23.422 --> 11:25.188
- Where we at, Shake?
- 4%.

11:25.190 --> 11:26.375
Wait. No, went back down.
