01:50.640 --> 01:52.835
Oh, Peg, I'm so excited.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.755
It has been so long. So very, very long.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.758
But in just a few brief moments...

01:59.000 --> 02:02.675
...a brand-new baseball season
officially begins.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.678
Well, Al, as long as I live...

02:07.880 --> 02:10.952
...I will never understand
your fascination with baseball.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.351
Well, if you'd promise
not to live too long I'd tell you.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.230
I mean, baseball is so boring.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.278
How come they don't have
a Harlem Globetrotters baseball team?

02:22.520 --> 02:25.398
They do. They're called the Mets.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.951
Hey, hey, hey.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.276
Do I smell trail mix?

02:39.520 --> 02:42.318
Fresh from under the sofa cushions.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.471
Grab a seat.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.473
Button.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.828
Oh, hey, before I forget...

02:51.040 --> 02:54.032
...Marcie wanted to invite you
to an April Fools' party tomorrow.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.879
Really? Man, I love April Fools' Day.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.079
Peg, remember Mrs. Quinn,
our Music teacher?

03:01.480 --> 03:03.550
Yeah. One April Fools'...

03:03.800 --> 03:08.237
...we faked a love note
from her to the female Gym teacher.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.639
And the school board
suspended her license.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.510
Just three days
before her retirement.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.197
And her husband divorced her,
left her penniless.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.357
Well, one April Fools' Day,
I called the operator...

03:27.600 --> 03:31.991
...said I couldn't get through to the zoo
because their lion was busy.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.472
You get it?

03:35.720 --> 03:37.392
Dad.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.874
Great news, Dad.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.156
Kelly and I wanna start up
our own business.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.960
So you'll loan us $5000?

03:51.840 --> 03:54.035
Well, sure.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.791
Jody, Buffy, let me truck on over
here to the wall safe. Nobody look.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.312
Well, strike me blind
and call me Charlie.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.357
It's been took.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.468
Quick. After them.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.678
I'll wait over here by the ball game.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.031
I didn't even know
we had a wall safe.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.517
Too bad it's gone.
Your brains were in it.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.355
Now, kids, if your father had been
a successful shoe salesman...

04:25.600 --> 04:28.672
Or husband, or lover or anything.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.758
- what business would it have been?
- A photography studio...

04:31.960 --> 04:34.838
...where lonely guys could get
pictures taken with pretty girls.

04:35.080 --> 04:39.039
Hey, now, that's not a bad idea.
How did you come up with that?

04:39.280 --> 04:42.670
Well, Saturday night and everyone
was out partying and everything...

04:42.920 --> 04:46.515
...so obviously Bud was upstairs
in his room looking at underwear ads.

04:46.760 --> 04:47.988
- Look.
- And I figured...

04:48.240 --> 04:50.913
It's not important
how she got the idea.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.230
The point is we need $5000.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.912
Well, a good panhandler
can pull in $500 a day.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.151
Five hundred dollars a day?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.436
We'll have Bud and Kelly's
open in no time.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.355
Hey, wait a minute. It was my idea.
We're gonna name it after me.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.996
There's already a place
called "In-N-Out."

05:18.200 --> 05:20.236
The game's starting.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.040
- Who are those guys?
- They're just a bunch of VIPs...

05:23.240 --> 05:24.593
...nobody cares about.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.319
That's the owner of the team.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.233
He's introducing a new guy
who just bought 10 percent of it.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.551
- That's him.
- Huh, that's who?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.597
That's him, Walter Traugott.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.274
I gotta go.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.398
Wait a second, Jefferson.
Come back here. What's wrong?

05:41.640 --> 05:43.756
Was it something Peg did?

05:44.680 --> 05:48.150
Because if it was, she'll be in
the basement until the All-Star break.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.908
Now who am I gonna
watch the game with?

05:55.360 --> 05:58.272
- Another thing about this baseball...
- No.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.114
Now, why does that guy
get to walk to the base?

06:01.360 --> 06:03.954
Because he got four balls.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.357
- Well...
- Don't even say it, Peg.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.797
If your mouth must open
and close, do it on this.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.560
If you paid as much attention to me
as you do to this...

06:24.760 --> 06:28.309
...I probably wouldn't mind so much.
- I do pay attention to you, Peg.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.437
No, he was safe.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.594
Al, I think I broke my tooth.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.518
He was safe.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.837
Safe. Safe. Safe.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.510
Please, Marcie,
I am not in the mood for this tonight.

06:59.160 --> 07:04.154
But, Jefferson,
it has been almost eight hours.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.991
Look, there's something
I have to tell you.

07:08.240 --> 07:12.028
Tonight I was watching the ball game
with Al and who do I see on the TV?

07:12.280 --> 07:14.669
Walter Traugott,
the new owner of the team.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.553
Odd that the owner
would be at the game.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.158
Mount me.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.428
Look, there's something else
I have to tell you.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.753
I haven't been completely honest
with you about my past.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.472
You mean you're not permanently
disabled and can work?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.670
No. Not that.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.993
Look, my real name
isn't Jefferson D'Arcy.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.629
I used to work for the CIA.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.553
And a few years ago
I was involved in a covert operation...

07:53.800 --> 07:56.951
...that sent a lot of bad people
to prison for a long time.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.715
But there was this one guy
that got away.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.997
The only person in the world
who can blow my cover.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.117
Walter Traugott.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.839
Well, thank God. I thought you
were gonna tell me you dated Cher.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.758
Well, I did, but...

08:19.480 --> 08:23.678
It wasn't part of the job,
it was just my turn.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.391
Now, I know you'll be upset.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.029
You'll probably go through
the classic...

08:32.280 --> 08:35.716
...denial, guilt, depression,
anger, acceptance syndrome.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.438
That is preposterous.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.477
Admit it. It's all my fault.
I should just kill myself.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.154
Or kill you, you son of a bitch.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.950
But I love you, whoever you are.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.428
What do we do now?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.148
I don't know.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.075
But if Traugott finds me,
I'm as dead as network TV.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.551
Maybe it's just a coincidence
that Traugott's in Chicago.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.716
I mean, Chicago is a big town.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.191
It's not like he's gonna come
through the window and get you.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.237
Jefferson.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.758
Gabby.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.593
Oh, my tooth.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.308
Jefferson, I can't stand to hear
Peg in so much pain.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.357
- You have any Novocain?
- No.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.275
Al, it's getting worse.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.750
How about some duct tape?

09:38.280 --> 09:40.077
- Hello?
- Hello.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.754
Yes, Golden Sunset
Retirement Home?

09:42.960 --> 09:45.190
Yes, I'm with the phone company.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.908
We've got a man
working on your phone lines...

09:48.120 --> 09:51.795
...so would you not pick up the phone
for the next five minutes or so...

09:52.000 --> 09:54.355
...or he'll be electrocuted.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.271
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.272
Bye.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.591
Hello?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.719
Oh, I love April Fools' Day.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.318
Hello, Chicago Memorial Hospital?

10:24.560 --> 10:27.120
Yes. Coronary Care unit, please.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.315
Room 410.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.754
I don't understand it.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.877
Well, we both look
desperate and homeless.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.396
Yet they give you all the money
and spit all over me.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.148
Why is that?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.436
You don't get it, do you?

10:45.400 --> 10:46.719
Look.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.599
This is not a fun-house mirror.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.311
This is actually what you look like.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.070
Now, on the other hand,
this is what I look like.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.512
And that is why
we're opening Kelly and Bud's.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.150
Spare change?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.509
- AI Bundy?
- Yes, officer?

11:29.720 --> 11:33.269
I'm innocent. I was abused.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.077
No, Mr. Bundy.
My name is Walter Traugott.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.432
Oh, the baseball-team owner.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.353
Yeah, I saw you on TV last night.
What are you doing here?

11:42.600 --> 11:47.037
I've got something to discuss with you
of a rather personal nature.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.872
Well, don't worry about it, Troggy.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.753
Your secret's safe with me.
I'll just go close the blinds...

11:51.960 --> 11:55.236
...and you can try on
anything you like here.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.190
For season tickets, I'll call a friend
of mine over at Victoria's Secret...

12:03.440 --> 12:06.477
...and you can coordinate.

12:11.520 --> 12:15.399
Thank you. No, Mr. Bundy,
I came here to ask you a question.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.349
Specifically, do you know
the man in this picture?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.675
Or this one.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.551
Or maybe this one.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.274
I'll cut to the chase.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.472
This man is one of the most
dangerous people in the world.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.029
Joey Bishop?

12:42.280 --> 12:44.714
I always suspected that.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.235
- That one.
- Him?

12:47.480 --> 12:51.598
- Why, that looks like...
- Like who, Mr. Bundy?

12:51.840 --> 12:54.229
Hey, now, If you're a cop,
I don't talk to the law...

12:54.440 --> 12:57.637
...I don't listen to the law,
I don't watch L.A. Law.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.033
Let me level with you.
The man I'm asking you about...

13:04.240 --> 13:07.437
...is a spy, Mr. Bundy.
A dangerous spy.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.797
And we want him. This is my card.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.873
I'll be in Chicago for two more days.

13:14.120 --> 13:18.079
Not that you'd put financial gain above
your country's national security...

13:18.320 --> 13:22.154
...but there is a reward for information
leading to the arrest of this man.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.877
Oh, rewards mean nothing to me.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.916
- How much is it, by the way?
- Fifty thousand dollars.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.876
I'll be talking to you.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.273
All right, Peg. I made the appointment
with the dentist.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.830
This better still hurt when we get there
because dentists aren't cheap.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.839
Hey, guys, what's up?

13:50.240 --> 13:51.958
Oh, nothing.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.670
Or as they say in the Kremlin,
"nyet."

13:59.320 --> 14:01.788
- AI.
- Peg, please just go wait in the car.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.996
- I'll be right there.
- Promise me, Al?

14:04.240 --> 14:05.719
Yes, I promise, Peg.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.351
- You swear to me, Al?
- Damn your hide, yes, I promise.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.710
Wait in the freaking car.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.679
Jeez, the things that women make
you say to show them you love them.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.397
- What do you want, buddy?
- Oh, nothing.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.837
It's just that I didn't get a chance
to talk to you much yesterday...

14:24.080 --> 14:28.153
...and I was just, you know,
wondering what was up, you know?

14:28.920 --> 14:31.150
- Nothing.
- Me neither.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.038
So...

14:33.560 --> 14:35.516
...ever been a spy?

14:38.520 --> 14:40.192
I beg your pardon?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.396
Okay. Okay.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.276
Let's get right to the point.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.512
Who won the World Series in '76?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.077
The Reds.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.958
- What?
- Interesting choice-ski, comrade.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.995
Look, shouldn't you be taking
Peggy to the dentist?

15:01.240 --> 15:03.879
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?

15:04.240 --> 15:06.310
- Do you know what I'm gonna do?
- What?

15:06.560 --> 15:09.996
I wanna play
Name the American Presidents.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.639
- You gotta be kidding.
- Afraid not.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.711
You go first.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.949
Okay. George Washington.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.078
- Eisenhower.
- John Adams.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.550
Eisenhower.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.748
Thomas Jefferson.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.917
Eisenhower.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.076
James K. Polk.

15:37.320 --> 15:41.279
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.791
Al, we have run through
the presidents 15 times.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.396
Just one more question.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.516
Big 'Uns magazine...

15:56.960 --> 15:58.712
...Hooters of the Month.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.035
November '88.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.794
Kimberly Nicholson. Born 1969.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.396
Turn ons: fast cars, walks
on the beach and young Rod Stewart.

16:09.640 --> 16:14.270
Turn offs: Men who smoke,
war and old Rod Stewart.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.348
Right?

16:16.920 --> 16:19.639
What's that?
I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.478
All right, let's say
you're an American.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.597
Of course I'm an American, Al.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.115
Look, what is going on here?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.039
Walter Traugott came into the store
today, told me you were a spy.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.670
Said he'd give me a $50,000 reward
if I turned you in.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.319
Did you?

16:45.920 --> 16:49.833
Do I look like I'm in Rio
without the wife and kids?

16:51.680 --> 16:53.511
Although there is a plane
leaving at 6.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.159
All right.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.839
- All right. Look, Al, I was a spy.
- Thank you.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.477
But for us.
Traugott's the bad guy.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.916
Besides, Al, you have known me
for three years.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.559
You know I'm an American.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.998
Well, so am I, that's why it's so hard
to turn down free money.

17:19.960 --> 17:23.396
I've got another reason for you
not to turn me in, Al.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.358
Because you're a Bundy...

17:25.599 --> 17:30.071
...and if you put a D
where the N is, you're a buddy.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.837
If you put the N where the D is,
I'm a bunny. What's your point?

17:41.320 --> 17:42.753
Look, I'm not gonna turn you in.

17:42.960 --> 17:48.671
There are three things a Bundy will
never be: rich, a snitch or regular.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.909
So relax. Your secret's safe with me.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.594
- Thanks, Al.
- One last question.

17:56.440 --> 18:02.037
Who was the vice-president
under President Eisenhower?

18:02.640 --> 18:04.392
I have no idea.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.236
You are an American.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.838
- AI.
- Oh, yeah, the dentist.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.117
- All right, let's go.
- I've already been, you kumquat.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.237
Here's the bill.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.199
- How am I supposed to pay this?
- Don't look at me.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.670
If only it were that easy.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.794
Dad, got some bad news.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.429
The traditional Bundy greeting.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.675
The police confiscated
our beggings.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.230
And we're being sued
for impersonating the homeless.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.313
You know what the worst part is?

18:44.560 --> 18:47.870
That it's too late to adopt
the Menendez boys?

18:52.520 --> 18:56.354
No. The photo studio
would have been a success.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.398
Panhandling. This is what we get
for listening to Mr. D'Arcy.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.359
Yeah. Boy, I wish
we had something on him.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.830
Fifty thousand dollars.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.310
Fifty thousand dollars.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.630
Fifty thousand dollars.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.308
Hi, Al.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.235
Hey, I got some great stuff
for the April Fools' party tonight.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.749
Check it out, fake vomit.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.956
And fake doggie doo-doo.

19:44.680 --> 19:48.150
Humans.
They really know how to party.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.117
I've been thinking about it
and I can't go to the party with you.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.228
Why not?

19:54.480 --> 19:57.597
Oh, it's the lame
April Fools' gags, huh?

19:57.840 --> 20:00.752
Well, that and I could get killed
hanging out with you.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.037
See, I don't wanna go that way.
I wanna go the way all Bundys go.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.077
I wanna hang myself
in my own basement...

20:06.320 --> 20:08.436
...by jumping off my workbench.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.869
Not that I have it planned out
or anything.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.872
But nobody knows who I am, Al.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.190
Unless you told.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.636
Now, why would I do that?
Who would I tell?

20:18.880 --> 20:22.714
Paging Mr. Traugott.
Paging Mr. Walter Traugott.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.869
Now, that page
could have come from anybody.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.999
Mr. Al Bundy paging Walter Traugott.

20:34.520 --> 20:38.513
What? Jefferson, now, I swear
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.991
I see now what I have to do.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.913
But I didn't have
nothing to do with that.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.472
You would think
after a few years...

20:52.720 --> 20:55.951
...you could count on a friend
to take him at his word.

20:56.800 --> 21:01.954
But I guess you just never know
who you can really trust, hey, buddy?

21:02.640 --> 21:05.916
That's bunny.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.397
With two N's.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.359
Don't grovel, Al.
Look, if you have to say anything...

21:19.160 --> 21:22.550
...I want you to take a deep breath...

21:22.800 --> 21:24.028
...and tell me...

21:26.200 --> 21:29.476
...who's the best damn April Fooler
in the whole world?

21:43.880 --> 21:45.836
- April Fool?
- That's right.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.310
April Fool.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.797
What about that guy
that came to my store?

21:51.720 --> 21:55.156
Walter Traugott? He's an old friend
of the family from D.C.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.755
I sent him into your store
with that story, Al.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.709
And you bought it
hook, line, and sinker.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.516
Oh, yeah? Well, you better not use
your phone for the next five minutes...

22:05.760 --> 22:08.638
...because someone's gonna be
working on your lines.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.831
Nice try.
Come on, let's go to the party.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.310
But you mean
none of that spy stuff was true?

22:17.560 --> 22:19.835
Oh, come on, Al.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.196
If I was really involved espionage...

22:22.400 --> 22:25.597
...couldn't I have just made one
phone call and had Traugott taken out?

22:25.840 --> 22:28.229
- I guess.
- Well, then, what do you think?

22:30.960 --> 22:33.520
And that's a ground out to third.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.032
Oh, my God.
Ladies and gentlemen...

22:38.280 --> 22:41.829
...Walter Traugott fell to the ground
from an upper deck luxury box.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.630
And now some other scores
around the league.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.798
In the fifth, Milwauk ee is leading
the White Sox 6 to 1.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.390
And in Los Angeles,
the Dodgers still suck.
