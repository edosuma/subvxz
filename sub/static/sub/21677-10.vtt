WEBVTT

00:12.875 --> 00:13.375
- Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:14.958 --> 00:16.417
- I'd love to take you
on a date with me.

00:18.833 --> 00:20.292
- Yeah.

00:20.292 --> 00:21.375
- Could've told me
you had a boyfriend.

00:21.375 --> 00:22.375
Let's just call it a day

00:22.375 --> 00:23.708
and get on with our lives.

00:23.708 --> 00:25.833
- I feel like Kyle expected
too much.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.375
- I'm gonna be nice,
but deep down,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.042
I'm just like, "F--- off."

00:29.042 --> 00:30.625
- Hey, Ben.
What's going on?

00:30.625 --> 00:32.208
- James is my older brother.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.708
Listen, I thought
it would be really cool

00:33.708 --> 00:35.958
if you came out and visited me.
- Yeah, sure.

00:35.958 --> 00:37.833
- The pool is floating away.

00:37.833 --> 00:39.458
- Are you guys leaving me?

00:39.458 --> 00:41.708
- Jesus Christ, could f--- up
a two-car funeral.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.708
- Why can't we make this be
a functional deck crew?

00:43.708 --> 00:45.542
- I need to come out
to West Hollywood with you two.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.125
All my friends are drag queens
and all that kind of stuff.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.208
- Whoa, we're both gay?

00:54.208 --> 00:55.417
- Who's Ashley?

00:57.333 --> 00:59.375
- You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.875
- How was your date?

01:23.875 --> 01:24.917
- Yeah, the date was
really good.

01:24.917 --> 01:25.917
It was so nice.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.000
We kissed.
- No way.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.250
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.083
- That did not sound positive.

01:45.583 --> 01:46.792
- Oh, fun.

01:48.417 --> 01:50.542
- But the things is,
I'm not, like, into dudes.

01:52.542 --> 01:55.208
- Like...what?

01:55.208 --> 01:57.792
I did not see this coming
at all.

01:57.792 --> 01:59.375
- Are you joking,
or are you serious?

02:00.292 --> 02:01.958
- Yeah.
Okay.

02:01.958 --> 02:04.917
Last week, Kyle was
aggressively pursuing Sierra,

02:04.917 --> 02:06.958
and now he has
a transgender girlfriend.

02:06.958 --> 02:08.208
Came out of nowhere.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.042
Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.250
- When I saw
how everyone was so cool

02:15.250 --> 02:16.750
with Kate being open
about her sexuality,

02:16.750 --> 02:17.792
I thought,
"These guys are all right.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.125
I'll say something."

02:19.125 --> 02:20.583
- How long
have you guys been dating?

02:21.667 --> 02:22.750
- Yeah?

02:24.333 --> 02:25.458
F---.

02:27.917 --> 02:30.208
- So, she's a man becoming
a woman?

02:31.792 --> 02:33.750
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know what I mean?

02:33.750 --> 02:34.792
- Yeah.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.500
- Dude, I have no judgments.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.667
Your personal beliefs
and all that,

02:42.667 --> 02:43.958
that sh--, man,

02:43.958 --> 02:45.958
I can't judge you on that.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.500
- How was your date, by the way?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.208
I feel like I haven't
talked to you.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.500
- Um...

02:56.500 --> 02:57.958
with old Ems?

02:57.958 --> 02:59.708
- Yeah. Well, unless you went
on another date.

02:59.708 --> 03:00.875
- Ha-ha.
- So, how was it?

03:00.875 --> 03:02.042
What did you do?

03:02.042 --> 03:03.875
- Um, what did we do?

03:03.875 --> 03:04.875
We had dinner.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.625
Um...

03:06.625 --> 03:07.625
- Tell me about it.

03:07.625 --> 03:09.375
- We, you know--

03:09.375 --> 03:10.792
- You want to elaborate at all?

03:10.792 --> 03:12.125
- And we went for a little walk.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.125
- Do you like long walks
on the beach?

03:14.125 --> 03:15.375
- Oh, yeah.
Tons.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.125
- So, you've got that
in common.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.375
You guys like London, art,
and long walks on the beach.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.833
- What are we doing here?
Are we just doing a tally?

03:22.833 --> 03:24.500
Like, a morning tally?

03:26.333 --> 03:28.958
- Do you want me not to ask
about you and Em anymore?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.292
I felt like it was
a little uncomfortable.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.000
- All right, okay.
Just trying to, you know,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.875
just--you know what I mean.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.417
I actually really like Emily,

03:37.417 --> 03:41.583
but I'm not sure if I want
to share that with Kate.

03:41.583 --> 03:44.250
- I'm not asking you to map out
your life plan with her.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.917
I was just seeing
how your date went.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.750
Okay.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.833
- I forgot to tell you...
- What?

03:58.500 --> 04:00.000
With a drag queen.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.875
And he said that he's dating
a transgender woman.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.417
- What?
- I was shocked.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.083
- So does that make you gay?

04:06.083 --> 04:08.167
- I mean, he went for you.
He's not gonna be gay, is he?

04:08.167 --> 04:09.250
He's bi.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.917
- I'm kind of manly.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.917
I'm a little confused
and a little hurt.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.500
It just seems crazy
that he's trying

04:15.500 --> 04:16.583
to pursue anything with me

04:16.583 --> 04:18.125
when he has a kid

04:18.125 --> 04:21.792
and then another whole situation
with another girl.

04:21.792 --> 04:22.875
Okay.

04:24.917 --> 04:28.958
- Kate, Ben, Kelley, I need
you guys in the crew mess ASAP.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.750
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.042
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

04:34.042 --> 04:35.958
- How we doing?
Number seven.

04:35.958 --> 04:39.542
Liza Sandler, Lori Gladstone.
They are best friends.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.708
Lori's a fashion stylist
and a personal shopper,

04:42.708 --> 04:45.292
which means
she probably married wealthy.

04:45.292 --> 04:46.625
They're bringing

04:46.625 --> 04:48.292
their best friends,
Glen and Pat,

04:48.292 --> 04:50.250
who are husband and husband,

04:50.250 --> 04:52.542
and these guys
have invited along

04:52.542 --> 04:54.375
Jimmy and Matt.

04:54.375 --> 04:56.625
Each picnic is for day one.

04:56.625 --> 04:58.000
- That's fine.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.333
- And they have planned
a surprise drag show

05:00.333 --> 05:01.958
and dance for Liza's birthday.

05:01.958 --> 05:04.625
- Kyle will be excited.

05:04.625 --> 05:08.833
Last night, Kyle shares with us
that he was a drag dancer,

05:08.833 --> 05:10.833
and now we have a charter guest

05:10.833 --> 05:12.583
that wants to have
a drag party.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.667
It's just so funny
how life works out.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.417
- Do your stews want
to get involved?

05:16.417 --> 05:19.000
- We might be busy serving
dinner and cleaning cabins.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.417
And you look so much better
in drag.

05:20.417 --> 05:21.667
- Yeah.

05:23.167 --> 05:24.917
- I haven't been in drag.

05:24.917 --> 05:26.000
- That's it, I'm done.
- I think it's gonna be

05:26.000 --> 05:27.083
super fun.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
- Are you busy?
Will you grab that

05:31.000 --> 05:32.458
and help me upstairs?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.500
- Upstairs.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.875
To the bridge salon.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.167
- Nico, Nico, Kelley.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.875
- Can you come to
the bridge deck aft?

05:52.875 --> 05:54.042
- Copy.

05:56.042 --> 05:57.042
What's going on?

05:57.042 --> 05:59.875
- Just a quick chit-chat.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.833
In the crew meeting about Kyle
and the wine and all that.

06:02.833 --> 06:05.042
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kyle, you own that one.

06:05.042 --> 06:06.542
- I was calling
over the radio as well,

06:06.542 --> 06:07.958
but obviously it wasn't heard,

06:07.958 --> 06:10.292
but I was on bridge deck
calling it out.

06:10.292 --> 06:11.875
- During that time
in front of the whole crew

06:11.875 --> 06:14.167
is not the time to say anything.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.542
- Is it that big of a deal
that I just said

06:15.542 --> 06:17.042
one comment about it?

06:17.042 --> 06:18.542
- The comment wasn't that bad.
It was just

06:18.542 --> 06:20.542
where it was placed
in front of everybody.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.083
It looks like we're divided
on deck.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.542
Just next time, if something
along that line happens,

06:24.542 --> 06:26.417
let's go to Captain afterwards
and talk to him.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.000
- If I were the boatswain,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.250
I would defend my deck team
in any situation.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.417
End of story.

06:31.417 --> 06:33.250
I don't care what Kelley says.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.333
- Thank you.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
- What's Ashley like?

06:38.500 --> 06:41.083
Like, she must be a lovely girl
if you're with her, right?

06:41.083 --> 06:42.500
- Oh, mate, f---.
- You're like--

06:44.917 --> 06:47.000
Excuse the pun, right?

06:49.250 --> 06:51.000
- I want to know
what she's like, or he's like.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.375
- It's she...

06:56.083 --> 06:58.333
My life has been topsy-turvy.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.583
You know, I was--
I got into a few situations

07:00.583 --> 07:03.375
in my life,
and I met Ashley one night,

07:03.375 --> 07:06.792
and since then, I just feel--
I feel all right.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.250
I feel like I belong somewhere.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.083
For years, I never felt
like I belonged.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.125
And when I met her...yeah.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.625
F---, man.

07:14.625 --> 07:15.958
- Has she done--
has she undergone

07:15.958 --> 07:17.417
any operations or anything
like that?

07:18.625 --> 07:19.625
- All right,
and then it will grow--

07:19.625 --> 07:20.958
her boobs will grow?

07:20.958 --> 07:23.958
- They're growing.
- And her...

07:23.958 --> 07:27.125
that kind of shrinks
a little bit, or...?

07:27.125 --> 07:28.792
- Kind of.
- It's just so--

07:28.792 --> 07:30.625
it's such a weird subject
to talk about,

07:30.625 --> 07:33.292
'cause people get offended
so easily about it, you know?

07:33.292 --> 07:34.375
It's just like...

07:39.417 --> 07:41.542
For years,
I never fit it anywhere.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.208
And then when I met Ashley,

07:43.208 --> 07:46.708
she made me feel like
that I was actually a person.

07:48.417 --> 07:49.833
- No, mate, no, I don't know.

07:49.833 --> 07:51.375
I think it's a beautiful thing.

08:05.667 --> 08:06.958
- Let's get the stainless done.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.958
- Thank you.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.167
- All right.
Hour and 20 minutes.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.083
- Before they come?
- Yeah.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.417
- You think too much.
- So do you.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.667
So, you know.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.000
- Ro?
- Can you see me?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.333
- Is the poor connection
me or you?

08:25.333 --> 08:26.917
You're super pixilated.

08:26.917 --> 08:29.792
- Um...are you there?

08:29.792 --> 08:31.875
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- I can't hear you.

08:31.875 --> 08:32.875
- Oh, babe, I'm sorry.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.625
Things with Ro are good,

08:34.625 --> 08:38.042
but I thought her visiting
would, like, make her understand

08:38.042 --> 08:40.042
how busy I am,

08:40.042 --> 08:41.750
how bad the Wi-Fi is.

08:44.042 --> 08:45.792
- I know it's frustrating.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.958
I'm really not used to being
in a relationship

08:47.958 --> 08:50.542
where the other person wants
this much attention.

08:50.542 --> 08:54.083
I think unless you've worked on
a yacht, you just don't get it.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.542
- Babe, I have to go to work.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.708
- No.
- I'm sorry.

08:58.708 --> 09:00.708
- Attention all crew:

09:00.708 --> 09:02.292
ten minutes
until the guests show up.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.292
Ten minutes.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.375
- Copy that.

09:08.708 --> 09:10.583
- Are we gonna get you

09:10.583 --> 09:12.417
out there on time?
- Yep, we are. I'm ready.

09:12.417 --> 09:13.583
- He's a changed man.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.542
- Twisted you up a little.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.750
- It's so beautiful out.
I'm so excited!

09:19.750 --> 09:22.875
- It's gorgeous out.
- Valor! Look at the oar.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.375
- So excited.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.417
- Max, Frank, you okay?

09:26.417 --> 09:28.417
- Okay.
Game faces, everybody.

09:28.417 --> 09:29.583
Showtime.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.750
- You were being nasty with me
when I did nothing wrong.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.250
- Oh, my God.
You're a queen.

09:40.167 --> 09:40.750
- Here we go!

09:40.458 --> 09:40.750
- So excited.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.750
- I hope the dogs are gonna
be okay.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.500
- Oh, my goodness.
- Showtime.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.750
- Hi, everyone!
- Welcome aboard.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.417
- Hi.
- Liza. Nice to meet you.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.625
- Welcome, Liza, I'm Kate.
- Hi, how are you?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.292
- Captain, how are you?
Pleasure.

09:53.292 --> 09:56.042
- It's so fun to have
a bunch of gay men on a boat.

09:56.042 --> 09:57.708
- Hi, there. Hi, guys.
- Hi, how are you?

09:57.708 --> 10:01.458
- The gayest charter season
ever!

10:01.458 --> 10:02.458
- Kate will show you
to your quarters

10:02.458 --> 10:03.792
and give you a tour of the boat,

10:03.792 --> 10:05.292
and we'll get moving.
- All right.

10:05.292 --> 10:06.625
- Great.
- We're gonna go around

10:06.625 --> 10:08.250
this way.
- Let's follow Kate.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.292
- Watch your step.
- So pretty.

10:09.292 --> 10:10.750
- This is beautiful.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.125
- So,
we'll go to the master first.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.958
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

10:13.958 --> 10:16.792
- This bathroom is huge.
- This toilet plays music

10:16.792 --> 10:17.917
and it's got heating.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.292
- Love, love, love.

10:19.292 --> 10:21.583
- And this is the bunny pad.
- The bunny pad!

10:21.583 --> 10:24.125
- Yeah.
It could be the doggy pad.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.958
- All right,
we're gonna go about astern.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.792
- Bow's clear.

10:28.792 --> 10:31.125
- All lines are clear, Cap.
All lines are clear.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.000
She's coming out.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.583
- Perfect.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.333
These past few charters have
been really bumpy.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.458
Captain's not happy,

10:37.458 --> 10:39.792
so I want us to do 110%.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.833
- Good job, deck crew.
Nicely done.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.917
- I don't have the boobs
like you do.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.333
- Yes, these boobs.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.500
- Would you like us
to unpack you?

10:51.500 --> 10:53.125
- No, no, we're cool.
- Okay.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.000
- This is what you're gonna
help me with later

10:55.000 --> 10:57.292
that they don't know about.
- I'm so excited already.

10:57.292 --> 10:59.167
- I've got a couple of things
going on in here.

10:59.167 --> 11:01.500
- Confetti cannons
and eyelashes.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.417
- Seems like this drag show

11:03.417 --> 11:06.000
is the pièce de résistance
for this entire charter.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.458
They've been planning it.
They packed luggage.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.000
It's a surprise.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.833
- If some of the crew would want
to put something on...

11:11.833 --> 11:16.708
- Actually, one deck member has
some experience.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.375
- All righty right.

11:20.042 --> 11:22.458
- Cheers.
- It's your birthday, so...

11:22.458 --> 11:23.542
- It's my birthday soon.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.042
- Hey, Kyle.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.625
- You're gonna be really pumped
when I tell you some good news.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.042
Um, the two primaries--

11:32.042 --> 11:33.500
they had a whole suitcase,

11:33.500 --> 11:37.000
like, five hot pink wigs,
sequin gowns,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.625
and I was like,

11:38.625 --> 11:43.500
"Actually, we have a crew member
that has some experience."

11:43.500 --> 11:45.708
- I love the way you're holding
a carrot right now.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.875
- Give me three shots.

11:55.417 --> 11:56.917
Lock it in.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.417
- Where's everyone going?
Are we having a picnic?

12:03.417 --> 12:06.208
- We're having a beach picnic.
- That's nice.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.583
- Kate, Kate, Kelley.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.042
I'm about to take over
all the drinks.

12:09.042 --> 12:10.750
Do you want to send
any of your stews?

12:10.750 --> 12:12.083
- Um, yeah, I'll come over.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.250
I'm gonna go over now.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.833
- Okay.
When should I head over?

12:14.833 --> 12:16.417
Are they gonna tell me?
- Yeah, we'll let you know.

12:16.417 --> 12:17.417
- Okay.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.500
- Emily...

12:20.708 --> 12:22.542
- Oh, copy.
Thank you.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.750
- Hey, Nico, we're gonna make
a first run to the beach.

12:28.250 --> 12:31.708
- Hello! Whoo!

12:31.708 --> 12:33.083
I don't know
where they breed them.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.375
- Those are Midwesterners.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.208
- Yeah, they're corn-fed.

12:36.208 --> 12:37.792
- Yeah, what I eat is corn.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.833
I want to eat his corn.

12:41.292 --> 12:42.958
- One, two, three.
Go.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.708
- Ugh.
What a life, hey?

12:56.708 --> 12:57.708
- Yes.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.750
- My face is white,
and my body is orange.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.292
- We forfeit.
We forfeit.

13:03.292 --> 13:06.458
- I'm gonna put deodorant
under my boobs.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.958
- What--what just happened here?

13:07.958 --> 13:09.792
- Kelley, Kelley, Lee.
Come on up the bridge.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.125
- En route.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.125
- Sierra, Sierra, Kate.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.792
- Go ahead.
- Can you come over

13:15.792 --> 13:17.292
with the food and the guests

13:17.292 --> 13:19.667
with plastic cups
and ice?

13:19.667 --> 13:21.917
- Copy that.
- What's up, Cap?

13:21.917 --> 13:23.458
- Okay, right now
they're just sitting around

13:23.458 --> 13:24.917
waiting for something to happen.

13:24.917 --> 13:26.667
- Yeah, all our stuff is
basically over there.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.083
We're just waiting on Sierra.

13:28.083 --> 13:31.125
- Look at the sea turtle.
Look at the turtle!

13:31.125 --> 13:32.500
- So I was just about to go
have a talk with her.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
- Okay.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
I like the way

13:34.500 --> 13:36.125
Kelley is attacking his job.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.000
I hope it continues
in this fashion.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.333
I hope it doesn't regress.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.167
- What are we doing?
Where are we going?

13:41.167 --> 13:43.333
- Sierra, Sierra, Kelley.
- Go ahead.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.000
- When do you think we're gonna
be taking the guests over?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.083
- Ben?
- What? Yeah?

13:47.083 --> 13:48.875
- Has the food gone over?
- No.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.750
- But when is the picnic?
- I don't know.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.292
- You want to go ask her
about the guests?

13:54.292 --> 13:56.000
- Do you know when?
- It can't go over

13:56.000 --> 13:57.292
until I finish
this vinaigrette...

13:58.500 --> 13:59.667
Which will be five minutes.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.167
- Are we leaving?
- No.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.833
There's not much organization.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.042
- Sorry.

14:05.792 --> 14:07.000
- I'm finding out right now.

14:09.458 --> 14:10.875
So we're waiting on you on that.
- I'm finding out.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.625
- All right.
- Hey, it's not up to me.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.375
- Well, when the food is
gonna be ready, right?

14:14.375 --> 14:15.875
- No, I know, but they're fine
to go and have drinks

14:15.875 --> 14:17.500
probably first.
- Okay, well, I'll find out.

14:19.042 --> 14:22.208
- Sierra's actions in general
annoy me.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.708
Her as a person annoys me.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.375
- When would you guys like
to head over to the beach?

14:26.375 --> 14:28.125
- Right now.
- Yeah, let's go.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.000
- So we'll head over now?
- That's awesome.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.333
- It's so weird.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.042
Usually a beach setup's
like, "Aah!"

14:33.042 --> 14:34.875
- Yeah.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.208
- No, I was telling her
what time it was.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.458
- They're gonna head over now.
Food is not gonna be ready

14:39.458 --> 14:41.500
until 1:45, lunch is planned.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.250
- Yeah.
We'll take them,

14:43.250 --> 14:44.833
and then we'll come back
and get the food.

14:44.833 --> 14:45.875
- Asshole.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.375
I'm having a conversation
with the guests,

14:49.375 --> 14:50.583
and he hears me say a time,

14:50.583 --> 14:51.833
and then he runs
and tells Kelley.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.500
Like, he has no clue.
Like,

14:53.500 --> 14:55.083
that should've been, like,
between Kelley and I...

14:55.083 --> 14:56.417
- Yeah.
- On the radio.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.417
- That's annoying.
- Chill out.

14:57.417 --> 14:58.917
I think he's a little...

14:58.917 --> 15:01.250
I don't have a problem with Kyle
as a person.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.083
But if I don't absolutely have
to talk to him,

15:03.083 --> 15:04.500
I don't think I'm going to.

15:06.667 --> 15:07.750
- You just got to let it go.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.083
- Kelley, Kelley, Kate.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.750
How's the status of the guests?

15:10.750 --> 15:12.583
- If she's not gonna do it,
I'll have you

15:12.583 --> 15:14.250
go up there and get the guests--
yep, go get them.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.083
I'm just loading up the guests
now in the rib.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.250
- Copy.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.167
- They're gonna head over.

15:20.167 --> 15:21.833
Enjoy your break.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.250
- Do you have the dog bowl?

15:23.250 --> 15:24.958
- I did.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.292
You do.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.792
Thank you.

15:27.792 --> 15:29.458
Bye-bye, have fun.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.792
Here you are, Pat.
Pardon my reach.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.042
- Oh, come on, man.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.292
- Hi, guys!

15:54.708 --> 15:57.125
- This is so nice.
- We have rosé on the table.

15:57.125 --> 16:00.375
And the food is coming over
in about five minutes.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.125
- Cheers, everyone.
- Thank you, Valor crew.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.875
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, guys.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.667
- Put them in the shade.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.917
- Oh, my God, guys.
This is so wonderful.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.458
- Thanks, brother.
- Okay. Cheers.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.292
- Katie, Kate,
food's incoming.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.083
Some vinaigrette, madam.
- Thank you.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.917
- If there's leftovers, eat.
- Ben's baby--watch your back.

16:20.917 --> 16:23.500
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, my God, that's fabulous.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.667
- You're welcome.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.083
- Yeah, I'm on my break now.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.667
- You want vegetables
and sautéed fish, right?

16:28.667 --> 16:31.167
- Oh, Ben, thank you.
I feel bad now.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.750
- Why, because you took
two minutes out of my day?

16:33.750 --> 16:36.000
- Thank you so much.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.500
- Oh, you're welcome, baby.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.458
You're welcome.
- Thank you.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.125
- Y'all need to deal with that
on y'all's own.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.333
I'm tired of hearing about it.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.000
My main problem
with Kyle and Sierra is

16:46.000 --> 16:47.792
that they both talk a lot.

16:47.792 --> 16:49.875
And they need to handle this
like mature adults

16:49.875 --> 16:53.208
so that we as a crew
don't have to deal with it.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.042
Lauren, Lauren, Kelley.
- Go ahead.

16:55.042 --> 16:56.875
- I'm gonna switch Kyle out
with you

16:56.875 --> 16:59.042
so you can come eat.
- All right.

16:59.042 --> 17:01.542
- Kyle, deal with Sierra.
Get that sh-- out of the way.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.292
- Come on, we're gonna bury her.
- We're--I got--

17:03.292 --> 17:04.500
- Sandy vagina.
- Ooh, I love it.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.875
I love it.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.625
Come see this.

17:09.625 --> 17:11.167
- So much drama.

17:11.167 --> 17:12.792
Girl, I don't know how you deal
with this.

17:12.792 --> 17:14.708
I feel like in the interior
we're just, like,

17:14.708 --> 17:16.625
"Okay, cool."

17:16.625 --> 17:19.042
Oh, speaking of
the handsome devil.

17:19.042 --> 17:20.958
The guys on this boat are
on their periods.

17:20.958 --> 17:23.208
Mood swings like crazy.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.208
- I'm gonna go with Kelley.
I trust you with the guests.

17:25.208 --> 17:26.208
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

17:26.208 --> 17:27.542
- Bye.

17:27.542 --> 17:30.333
- How'd it go?
- It went very well.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.417
You guys just want to get ready
to go and we'll head back.

17:32.417 --> 17:34.083
- Thank you very much.
- All right, then.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.333
- What do you need?

17:39.333 --> 17:40.500
- What do you need?

17:43.833 --> 17:46.167
- Excuse me? Yeah, we'll have
to take it down together.

17:46.167 --> 17:49.000
- Kyle, Kyle.
- Go for Kyle.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.792
- Well, Kyle,
now's a good time.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.125
- He said, "Now's a good time."

17:59.083 --> 18:00.083
- Kelley and I could've
worked that out

18:00.083 --> 18:01.667
through the radio communication.

18:02.708 --> 18:03.958
- Okay.

18:07.417 --> 18:08.958
- How was I being nasty to you?

18:10.375 --> 18:12.458
- Oh, my God,
with the theatrics, dude.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.792
I'm over it.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.917
- No, you are.
You're dramatic.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.792
Like, I'm not doing this.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.792
- Kelley and I were having
that conversation--

18:21.125 --> 18:23.042
- You're a queen, dude.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.542
- It's Liza's birthday tomorrow.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.125
You and I are gonna do a show.
- Okay.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.958
- You have an allergic reaction
to sea urchin?

18:31.958 --> 18:33.458
- Yeah.
- This will make you drowsy.

18:33.458 --> 18:34.417
Just to let you know.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.958
- Kyle?

18:35.958 --> 18:37.833
He's supposed to be dragged,
not drugged.

18:43.375 --> 18:44.083
- Oh, my God, dude.

18:43.792 --> 18:44.083
You're a queen.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.417
That's not a nice comment
to make, though, is it?

18:55.417 --> 18:56.708
- I'm sorry.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.833
- Not really.
No.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.250
If she never knew that
I slept with men or trans,

19:02.250 --> 19:03.833
she would've just called me
a f---ing dickhead,

19:03.833 --> 19:05.042
a prick,
or an asshole.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.083
- Thank you, Kyle.
I'll be back in a sec.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.500
- Did y'all get everything
sorted out?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.500
- Whatever the problem is,
like, that kind of reaction

19:15.500 --> 19:17.000
isn't necessary.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.458
I like a drama-free zone.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.125
I don't feel like I've ever,

19:20.125 --> 19:22.625
like, done anything offensive
towards Kyle.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.333
I don't know if it's because
he wanted to take me out

19:25.333 --> 19:26.833
and I didn't go for it.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.833
Like, all of the drama
with him--

19:28.833 --> 19:30.042
I don't deserve that.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.208
- These trousers are
a different fit.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.542
- They're darker than the ones
yesterday.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.292
- You notice everything,
don't you, Em?

19:38.292 --> 19:40.208
- Missed sign today, eh?
- Kyle's like,

19:40.208 --> 19:41.625
"You're nasty to me,"
and all this,

19:41.625 --> 19:43.542
and I'm like, "No, I'm not."

19:43.542 --> 19:45.542
I'm like,
"Did he ever even like me?"

19:47.208 --> 19:48.542
- So, what happened?

19:48.542 --> 19:50.208
- Ugh.
I had it out with her.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.042
Ugh.

19:59.042 --> 20:00.875
- He was riled up
when he got on the beach

20:00.875 --> 20:02.208
when Kelley's telling him to
have that confrontation with me.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.708
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

20:03.708 --> 20:05.500
- I don't know
why Kelley got into it.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.833
- Kelley gets into everything.
- Yeah, that's f---ed.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.125
I'd be really upset.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.708
Why the hell
would Kelley send Kyle

20:09.708 --> 20:11.000
out to see Sierra on the beach?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.875
It's so unprofessional.

20:12.875 --> 20:16.000
- Ugh, I just don't even want
to be, like, followed around.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.917
- So, it's Liza's birthday
tomorrow.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.583
- Yeah.
- We were gonna have dinner

20:20.583 --> 20:22.333
out on the table out there...
- Mm-hmm.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.000
- And then I was gonna
do a show solo,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.083
but I think you and I are
gonna do a double.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.375
- Okay.
- And this is

20:27.375 --> 20:28.667
my accessory closet.

20:28.667 --> 20:31.083
We have boas.
- Mm-hmm.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.333
- I've got pink wigs,
red wigs.

20:38.417 --> 20:40.375
- And my final weapon.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.542
- Yes.
- Okay.

20:41.542 --> 20:43.375
- What are you wearing?

20:43.375 --> 20:44.708
- Okay.
Deal.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.167
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:55.917 --> 20:56.917
- Hello.
- How we doing?

20:56.917 --> 20:58.083
- I'm good.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.708
You all clean up nicely.

21:02.708 --> 21:05.042
- Petite filet, scallop,

21:05.042 --> 21:07.792
butternut squash puree,

21:07.792 --> 21:09.625
asparagus, and brussels.

21:09.625 --> 21:10.750
Thanks, love.

21:10.750 --> 21:11.792
- Thank you.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.375
We have a petite filet
with scallops,

21:15.375 --> 21:17.250
asparagus, brussels sprouts.
- Wow.

21:17.250 --> 21:19.250
- Thank you, guys.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.125
- Eating steak,
drinking cabernet.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.458
What more do you want in life?

21:22.458 --> 21:24.792
- Um, I'll tell you what I want.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.792
- Are they enjoying?
- They are saying

21:27.792 --> 21:29.417
the filet is so wonderful.

21:29.417 --> 21:31.958
They love it.
And these Cheetos are fabulous.

21:31.958 --> 21:32.958
- Ugh!

21:34.125 --> 21:35.917
- You ready to be
a backup dancer?

21:35.917 --> 21:38.625
Oh, we should put
those eyelashes on you.

21:38.625 --> 21:42.125
- Umm, I don't know
about that one.

21:42.125 --> 21:44.250
- Night night.
I'm on earlies.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.500
See you tomorrow morning.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.167
- Okay, babe.
Here's a hug.

21:47.167 --> 21:48.958
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, always.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.458
- Good night.

21:51.458 --> 21:52.833
- We'll see you in the morning.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.792
- Good morning, you.

22:03.792 --> 22:05.417
- How are you, love?
- Amazing.

22:05.417 --> 22:06.958
- Oh, good for you.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.583
- Let's go see her.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.458
- Ready?
- Yep.

22:11.458 --> 22:14.125
- I got my big brother coming.
- Are you excited?

22:14.125 --> 22:15.417
- Yeah.
I am.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.625
I really am, actually.

22:16.625 --> 22:18.333
- When was the last time
you saw him?

22:18.333 --> 22:20.250
- Few months ago.
- Be nice to meet him.

22:20.250 --> 22:23.208
It's exciting for me to get
to meet Ben's brother,

22:23.208 --> 22:25.875
and hopefully learn
a bit more input about Ben

22:25.875 --> 22:27.667
and who I'm actually dating.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.042
Is he like you?

22:29.042 --> 22:31.375
- More eccentric, I'd say.
- You are?

22:31.375 --> 22:33.625
- I would say, yeah.
- Okay.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.042
- Wake up!
- She's up!

22:35.042 --> 22:36.875
- Fireball!

22:39.125 --> 22:40.167
- All right, this is quite nice.

22:40.167 --> 22:41.500
I might even have one of these.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.042
- I'll just wipe
the goat cheese off.

22:43.042 --> 22:45.125
I don't eat goat cheese.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.542
- Three, two, one, go.
- Go!

22:49.542 --> 22:51.875
- Whoo!
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

22:51.875 --> 22:52.875
Yeah!
- Go, go, go!

22:52.875 --> 22:54.542
- A shawl?
- Yeah!

22:54.542 --> 22:56.792
- Mm-hmm.
- Blow in the breeze, guys.

22:58.708 --> 23:01.042
- Who wants to dive?
- Happy birthday!

23:05.375 --> 23:06.542
- I've got you, Jack!

23:06.542 --> 23:09.083
- F---.
All righty.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.417
- Okay, Ben, the guests are
drying off and changing.

23:14.417 --> 23:16.167
It should be close.
- Thanks, Kate.

23:16.167 --> 23:17.750
- Mm-hmm.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.667
Do you think you're
about ready for lunch?

23:24.667 --> 23:26.208
- Yeah, just got to get dressed.
- Okay.

23:26.208 --> 23:28.250
- She was just doing that.
She was like...

23:28.250 --> 23:29.750
ahh.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.583
- This conch is a bit chewy.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.917
- Let me see.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.208
It tastes like conch-flavored
chewing gum.

23:40.917 --> 23:42.750
- I don't--I just don't think--
- It's very--

23:42.750 --> 23:43.917
- I don't think
I can serve that.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.625
What do you think, Em?

23:45.625 --> 23:47.458
- Well, the taste is delicious.

23:47.458 --> 23:48.792
- Right.

23:48.792 --> 23:50.583
You think I should put it out
or not?

23:50.583 --> 23:52.417
- I'd be okay with it.
- All right,

23:52.417 --> 23:54.083
let's just put the conch out,
okay?

23:54.083 --> 23:55.375
- Okay.

23:55.375 --> 23:56.625
It's very annoying to me

23:56.625 --> 23:59.750
that Ben goes around my head

23:59.750 --> 24:01.458
to ask Emily's opinion.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.125
Her answer is wrong.

24:03.125 --> 24:05.750
I would say it's edible,
but it's not ready yet.

24:05.750 --> 24:06.958
- I just want them to try it.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.458
- Okay.
Great.

24:08.458 --> 24:11.292
Peas and conch in a lime butter.

24:11.292 --> 24:12.583
- Oh, okay.
- Awesome.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.375
- Sounds interesting.
- Pardon me.

24:14.375 --> 24:17.417
- That's a horrible word,
"conch."

24:17.417 --> 24:19.292
- It's a little chewy.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.708
- It is a little chewy.

24:20.708 --> 24:22.708
- Too chewy?
- I'm picky, I'm picky.

24:22.708 --> 24:24.625
Like...

24:24.625 --> 24:26.667
- Are they happy?
- One of the ladies did say

24:26.667 --> 24:28.875
their conch was a little chewy.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.667
- Which one?
- Lori.

24:32.667 --> 24:33.792
- Okay.

24:33.792 --> 24:35.042
- I told you so.

24:40.833 --> 24:42.500
- So, you know this whole
thing's a surprise

24:42.500 --> 24:43.792
for Liza, right?
- Yeah.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.417
- I wanted to appear there.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.792
That's where the music should
come from.

24:55.458 --> 24:56.500
- Okay.

24:56.500 --> 24:57.583
- Yeah.
- That works.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.583
- ♪ It seems like
it was only yesterday ♪

25:04.583 --> 25:08.708
♪ You and I went
our separate ways ♪

25:08.708 --> 25:12.500
- I like drag because I wasn't
very confident in myself,

25:12.500 --> 25:14.000
'cause I had a sh-- childhood.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.792
And I was just sh--
at everything.

25:16.792 --> 25:18.542
But I did drag,
putting on a dress,

25:18.542 --> 25:19.958
and people were enjoying
themselves.

25:19.958 --> 25:23.208
So, it just showed the fact
that, yeah,

25:23.208 --> 25:24.625
I can do something I'm good at.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.958
And if I have to wear a dress
for it, f--- it.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.375
- Let's do it again.

25:35.875 --> 25:37.708
- It's happening.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.000
- Is it?
- Yeah.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.250
No.
It's one shoulder.

25:49.208 --> 25:51.333
- We're gonna say
that Peter Island is

25:51.333 --> 25:53.250
is having a firework show.
They're not.

25:53.250 --> 25:54.583
And move them up
to the bridge deck.

25:54.583 --> 25:56.750
- Okay.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.542
- Hey, Kyle.
Have you ever done uni?

25:58.542 --> 26:00.083
You want to try it?

26:00.083 --> 26:01.583
- Sea urchin.

26:01.583 --> 26:03.542
It's delicious.

26:03.542 --> 26:04.667
What do you think?

26:08.250 --> 26:10.583
- Oh, yeah, you can, man.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.083
Is everything all right?

26:14.667 --> 26:15.875
- Yeah, man.

26:19.083 --> 26:20.375
- Really?

26:23.417 --> 26:24.875
- F---, man.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.917
- F---.
- You just let us know

26:27.917 --> 26:29.417
if your throat starts swelling.

26:29.417 --> 26:32.042
- I promise.
I'm not trying to kill Kyle.

26:32.042 --> 26:33.375
- What is that?

26:35.958 --> 26:37.292
- You have an allergic reaction
to sea urchin?

26:37.292 --> 26:38.875
- Yeah.
- Sit down.

26:38.875 --> 26:41.958
- Yes. Antihistamine tablets.
- There we go, perfect.

26:41.958 --> 26:44.458
- Banophen.

26:44.458 --> 26:46.208
Diphenadrine.
This will make you drowsy.

26:46.208 --> 26:47.250
Just to let you know.

26:49.292 --> 26:51.625
Really careful.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.958
- I love that color combination
on you.

26:53.958 --> 26:55.042
It's fantastic.

26:55.042 --> 26:56.458
- It's--it's a Versace.

26:56.458 --> 26:57.625
Versace.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.208
- Emily, it's, um...

26:59.208 --> 27:00.917
- Figure it's about time now?
- Yes, please.

27:00.917 --> 27:03.625
- Hello, hello!
- I'm sitting in the middle.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.292
Kyle?

27:09.292 --> 27:11.792
- He's supposed to be dragged,
not drugged.

27:11.792 --> 27:15.500
This drag show is a surprise
for another guest.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.750
Like, could not be worse timing.

27:20.917 --> 27:22.333
- There he is.
Look at him.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.167
Good to see you.
- Great to see you, bub.

27:24.167 --> 27:25.750
- James is my older brother,

27:25.750 --> 27:28.083
and he's a little more reserved
than I am.

27:35.917 --> 27:36.292
- Is he passed out?

27:38.000 --> 27:39.625
- He's in a Benadryl coma.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.833
- Because you guys gave him
f---ing tranquilizers.

27:41.833 --> 27:44.458
- I didn't give him anything.
It's because you gave him uni.

27:44.458 --> 27:47.500
Sierra, go ahead and start
dinner service without me.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.333
- You gonna do his makeup
while he sleeps?

27:49.333 --> 27:52.750
- Mm-hmm, I wish somebody would
do this for me.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.417
I think he likes it.

27:54.417 --> 27:56.625
I'm gonna need
some Elmer's Glue.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.875
- I need a Red Bull
and an espresso.

27:59.875 --> 28:01.542
And a straw.
- And more espresso.

28:01.542 --> 28:03.708
- Hi, Captain!

28:03.708 --> 28:05.542
- All right, here we go.
Black caviar,

28:05.542 --> 28:07.875
uni, soy, and egg yolk.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.667
- Red Bull and an espresso.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.042
F---.

28:11.042 --> 28:13.042
- We have an uni shooter
with black caviar.

28:13.042 --> 28:14.375
- It's so good.
- Tasty.

28:14.375 --> 28:15.375
- Ugh!
- It was amazing.

28:16.542 --> 28:17.875
- Here.

28:17.875 --> 28:20.458
Just tilt your head--good.
Suck slowly.

28:21.958 --> 28:24.542
- Ladies, I think we're ready
for this.

28:24.542 --> 28:27.167
- Ben, it looks exquisite.
- Aw, thanks, babes.

28:27.167 --> 28:29.000
- Low setting, please.
Low setting, please.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.042
There's other functions.
I would prefer a brush.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.833
Ooh, actually,
that's quite nice.

28:32.833 --> 28:35.500
- Kate's such a legend
when it comes to parties.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.083
- Do not open your eyes.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.000
- And she always
makes it happen.

28:40.917 --> 28:42.917
- Keep away from fire or flame.
That's all.

28:42.917 --> 28:45.750
- That looks divine.
- Sweet potato puree,

28:45.750 --> 28:48.542
leeks, broccoli,
and lobster tail.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.417
- Ben, this is ridiculous!

28:50.417 --> 28:51.875
Are you okay?

28:51.875 --> 28:53.583
- Could you dance
with your eyes closed?

28:53.583 --> 28:54.917
- Here.
- Here we go.

28:54.917 --> 28:58.333
- Look at him.
- Let me get my eyes open.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.250
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

29:00.250 --> 29:01.583
- Oh, look.
You look great!

29:06.917 --> 29:08.250
- That was so amazing.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.583
I haven't had a lobster
that good

29:09.583 --> 29:10.833
in I can't even tell you
how long.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.583
- Now give me the kissy lips.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.417
- Liza, cheers.

29:14.417 --> 29:16.083
- Cheers!
- Thank you for making--

29:16.083 --> 29:18.625
- 21!
- L'chaim.

29:18.625 --> 29:20.083
- Thank you, everybody.
- Thank you.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.208
- I got to pee.

29:25.208 --> 29:26.375
- Let me feel.
- That's about a--

29:26.375 --> 29:27.458
that's about a good handful.

29:27.458 --> 29:28.458
- Do you guys want me to leave?

29:28.458 --> 29:29.458
- Want to feel?

29:29.458 --> 29:31.292
- Stop enjoying it.

29:31.292 --> 29:32.958
There are some fireworks
tonight,

29:32.958 --> 29:34.792
so we're gonna have dessert
up on the bridge deck.

29:34.792 --> 29:35.958
- Nice!
- Oh, awesome.

29:35.958 --> 29:38.292
- Just to change things up.

29:38.292 --> 29:40.750
- Liza,
we'll set your drink here

29:40.750 --> 29:41.917
if you'd like to sit
in the same spot.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.958
- Thank you.

29:43.958 --> 29:45.750
- Guys, it's right there.
- Thank you.

29:45.750 --> 29:49.250
- I feel like Charlie's Angels
right now.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.250
I'm not in the zone.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.292
- No.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.750
- The equilibrium's a bit off.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.250
- Guys? Ladies?
How'd you get up here?

29:56.250 --> 29:58.125
- Oh, the windows.
- That's amazing.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.792
- But the show must go on.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.625
- I can't wait for fireworks.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.833
- Fireworks, fireworks.

masculine and manly,

30:28.833 --> 30:31.000
but right now,
Kyle looks beautiful.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.667
I can tell this is not
his first gay rodeo.

done it without you guys.

31:03.125 --> 31:04.458
- That was great.

31:09.208 --> 31:10.375
- I'll see you in the morning,
honey.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.542
Thank you so much
for everything.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.042
- Good night.
No, thank you.

31:13.042 --> 31:14.542
- You're such a good fluffer.

31:20.875 --> 31:22.042
- There he is!

31:24.750 --> 31:26.417
- Morning.
- Hello.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.000
- Good morning.
- How are you?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.083
- I feel nauseated.
- Wonder why.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.250
Where's our superstar Kyle?
Is he around?

31:32.250 --> 31:33.917
- Hey, good-looking.
How are you?

31:33.917 --> 31:35.750
- Good, there's so much glitter
in my makeup bag.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.083
- I came on like a caterpillar.

31:38.083 --> 31:40.083
- And exploded like a butterfly.

31:40.083 --> 31:41.417
- You've still got glitter
in your beard.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.083
It looks like
you ate out Tinker Bell.

31:45.542 --> 31:48.208
- All right, you.
Here we go, yep.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.333
- Good morning.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.208
Good morning!

31:51.208 --> 31:52.500
- Oh, thank you.
With extra grease.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.750
- Cheers to our last meal.

31:53.750 --> 31:55.000
- Wonderful time.
- Cheers.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.375
- Whew.
- That's good.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.583
- Hey, we're
going to pull chain now.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.542
She's in the pot, Cap.
- Copy that.

32:04.542 --> 32:05.792
- That's my favorite part,
is locking that.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.625
Locking that, yeah.

32:14.625 --> 32:16.958
- Let's go ahead
and get prepped for docking.

32:16.958 --> 32:18.292
- Stern's all ready to go.

32:18.292 --> 32:19.292
- Switching stations.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.458
- We good?
- Yay!

32:26.458 --> 32:27.750
- Oh, you got that spring?

32:27.750 --> 32:29.208
- Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.
- Yep.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.958
- Go ahead and take up
the slack, Kyle.

32:30.958 --> 32:33.125
- Sitting perfect on the stern.
- I'm good here.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.125
- All right, lock it in.
- Good job, deck crew.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.292
Good job.
- Thank God.

32:37.292 --> 32:38.458
Thank you, Cap.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.583
- Ho-oh!
How perfect!

32:40.583 --> 32:42.458
Oh, that's awesome.

32:42.458 --> 32:44.292
- I'm gonna go and get some
trolleys for the luggage, yeah?

32:44.292 --> 32:45.542
- They're already getting them.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.625
- Attention all crew.
I need you on the aft deck now.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.833
- Want to say good-bye?

32:54.833 --> 32:56.000
Oh, whoa.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.667
- Break it up a bit.

32:59.667 --> 33:02.333
- The time has come.
The fun is done.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.917
Guys, thank you guys.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.250
- We had a great time.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.458
- Muah.
- We appreciate that.

33:09.792 --> 33:12.333
- Thank you for just an
absolutely amazing experience.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.167
- Incredible. Top-notch.
- Everything was fabulous.

33:14.167 --> 33:15.667
- Thank you so much.
- I'll give this to you

33:15.667 --> 33:16.958
and your crew.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.833
- Look, I'm, like, crying.
So sad!

33:18.833 --> 33:20.000
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!

33:21.000 --> 33:22.292
- Good work.

33:28.958 --> 33:31.125
Can I get everybody
in the crew mess ASAP?

33:36.542 --> 33:38.375
- Me and Sierra will never
get resolved,

33:38.375 --> 33:40.958
because I see her
for who she is.

33:42.625 --> 33:44.208
And she's a f---ing prick.

33:44.208 --> 33:45.333
- Can I squeeze in, toots?

33:46.375 --> 33:48.875
- Get in close.

33:48.875 --> 33:50.375
- I'm sandwiched.

33:51.625 --> 33:53.792
- So, I don't think there was

33:53.792 --> 33:55.958
anything we could've done
differently

33:55.958 --> 33:57.208
to make it any better.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.875
I thought
the drag show was good.

33:58.875 --> 34:02.042
Our tip this time's...

34:02.042 --> 34:04.042
not what we're used to.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.167
- I'm wasted!

34:08.167 --> 34:10.208
- Aah!
- Oh!

34:16.333 --> 34:16.750
- Our tip this time's...

34:19.083 --> 34:21.083
not what we're used to.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.667
$1,100 each.

34:24.667 --> 34:28.833
Kind of subpar,
but it happens, so...

34:29.833 --> 34:30.833
Ben.
- Thank you, sir.

34:30.833 --> 34:32.167
- Em, Lauren, Kate.

34:32.167 --> 34:33.250
- Thank you.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.750
- You got to do something
about that eyeliner, pal.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.750
- Cheers, Cap.
- And enjoy your night out,

34:41.750 --> 34:44.250
but we will finish up the boat
today.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.833
- Roger that.
- Thanks, guys.

34:48.833 --> 34:51.083
- How f---ing effective are we?
- Yeah.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.083
- I f---ing love
working with you, Nico.

34:55.292 --> 34:56.875
- Great job.
- All right, done.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.125
- Rosé?
Why not?

35:03.125 --> 35:05.375
- Maybe. My brother's coming in.
Let's make it special.

35:05.375 --> 35:07.125
- All right.
- I'm so excited to meet him.

35:07.125 --> 35:10.458
- We're gonna get loose, baby.
- Sh--.

35:12.125 --> 35:13.417
- There he is.
Look at him.

35:13.417 --> 35:14.750
There he is!

35:14.750 --> 35:16.125
- How are you, Ben?
- Give us a hug.

35:16.125 --> 35:17.958
Good to see you.
- Great to see you too,

35:17.958 --> 35:18.875
old sport.

35:18.875 --> 35:19.875
- Are you behaving yourself?

35:19.875 --> 35:21.583
- Of course I am.
I mean--

35:21.583 --> 35:22.625
- I don't believe a word of it.
- Of course I'm not.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.125
James is my older brother,

35:24.125 --> 35:25.958
and I've always looked up
to him.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.958
He's a little more conservative,

35:27.958 --> 35:29.375
a little more reserved
than I am.

35:29.375 --> 35:32.292
He's also really good-looking.

35:32.292 --> 35:34.167
- Hi!
- Miss Chastain.

35:34.167 --> 35:35.833
- Nice to see you again.
- Lovely to see you.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.833
- I really like James.
I've known him for a while now.

35:38.833 --> 35:43.125
And at this point, I'm more
happy to see James than Ben.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.792
- It's a beautiful boat,
isn't it?

35:44.792 --> 35:46.583
- It's gorgeous.
I can't wait to see Emily.

35:46.583 --> 35:47.833
- Oh, God.

35:47.833 --> 35:50.292
Hi!
- Hello, everybody.

35:50.292 --> 35:51.333
- I'm Lauren.
Nice to meet you.

35:51.333 --> 35:52.750
- Pleasure.
- Hello. Emily.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.458
- Emily? Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

35:54.458 --> 35:56.667
- Hi, I'm Sierra.
- Hi, I'm James.

35:56.667 --> 35:58.292
I know how hard you all work

35:58.292 --> 35:59.833
and how stressed
you all get, so...

35:59.833 --> 36:01.917
Ohh!

36:01.917 --> 36:05.458
- So, these were hand-rolled
in Grand Cayman.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.000
- James is so cute.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.833
So English and proper.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.833
And he sounds just like Ben.

36:10.833 --> 36:14.000
- So, how's Ben's cooking?
Is it any good?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.625
Oh, it's still horrible.

36:15.625 --> 36:17.375
- He gave me an allergic
reaction the other night.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.875
- That wasn't my fault.

36:18.875 --> 36:21.458
You need to be in control
of your allergies, my darling.

36:21.458 --> 36:23.042
- You guys are so hilarious.

36:24.375 --> 36:25.708
- You guys hang for a little.

36:25.708 --> 36:28.042
I'm gonna go find a shirt.
- Okay.

36:28.042 --> 36:30.500
- You guys sound so similar.
It's insane.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.625
- So, how was the date?

36:33.292 --> 36:34.625
Oh, you know about the date?

36:34.625 --> 36:36.500
- Yes, it was
all on the news this morning.

36:38.042 --> 36:39.458
- With Ben and James,

36:39.458 --> 36:40.708
there's definitely
similarities there.

36:40.708 --> 36:42.125
You can tell
they're siblings,

36:42.125 --> 36:44.375
but I think Ben's more manly.

36:44.375 --> 36:46.625
James is more well-groomed.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.542
- And you're English?
- I'm English, yes.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.625
I went to school in Sussex,
but I'm from London.

36:52.625 --> 36:53.708
- Nice.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.833
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Okay, have fun.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.583
- I'm in England. So, what about
you with immigration?

37:02.583 --> 37:04.333
- Should we get out of here?
Bye, gents.

37:04.333 --> 37:05.750
- Bye.
- After you now.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.208
Clearly, being a yachtie,

37:07.208 --> 37:09.542
we don't get
a lot of family time,

37:09.542 --> 37:12.583
and I really wanted to spend
some alone time with my brother.

37:12.583 --> 37:14.917
- The yacht is more impressive
than the family dinghy.

37:14.917 --> 37:16.917
- It is pretty ridiculous, yeah.

37:16.917 --> 37:18.250
- Night, Kel.
- See y'all in the morning.

37:18.250 --> 37:19.750
- What time are we up tomorrow?
- 8:00.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.750
- All right.
- The last three charters

37:21.750 --> 37:23.333
happened super rough.

37:23.333 --> 37:24.333
Let's get twisted.

37:24.333 --> 37:25.917
I want to get loose.

37:25.917 --> 37:27.542
You don't like it? That's fine.
Go to bed.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.917
- Cheers.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.000
We'll take the top three
appetizers, please.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.417
That's perfect.

37:36.417 --> 37:38.250
- Remember
when you were a little boy,

37:38.250 --> 37:40.542
Dad used to do the fish
and chips on a Friday night?

37:40.542 --> 37:43.125
He'd always pride himself
on how fresh the fish was.

37:43.125 --> 37:46.042
One week, he'd say, "I mean,
this fish was swimming

37:46.042 --> 37:47.625
at 3:00 a.m. this morning."

37:47.625 --> 37:49.458
And you looked over and said,

37:49.458 --> 37:51.125
"It kind of tastes like
the freezer."

37:51.125 --> 37:53.417
Dad was like,
"You little bastard!"

37:56.458 --> 37:58.292
- That's better.

37:58.292 --> 37:59.917
Get a nice, proper suck.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.125
You'll quite like it.

38:01.125 --> 38:03.375
Well, enjoy yourself.

38:08.125 --> 38:10.583
Since I've got here,
I've not masturbated once,

38:10.583 --> 38:12.958
so I thought it would be nice
to be in the master bedroom

38:12.958 --> 38:14.458
with a live television, which--

38:14.458 --> 38:16.958
there will probably be
some boobies.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.542
- You can sleep in the master.
- Thank you.

38:22.792 --> 38:24.167
Thank you very much.

38:24.167 --> 38:26.500
what do you think of Ems?

38:26.500 --> 38:30.000
- Um, she's very beautiful,
and very English.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.167
She could be perfect.

38:31.167 --> 38:32.500
- And she gets me.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.167
Can you imagine?
She gets me.

38:34.167 --> 38:36.083
- Ben, I think you may have
fallen in love.

38:36.083 --> 38:38.500
- Getting the approval
from my older brother is

38:38.500 --> 38:40.500
actually really important
to me,

38:40.500 --> 38:44.000
and for me, it kind of suggests
that I should pursue this.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.667
- As my prodigy, you're doing
much better than I ever did,

38:47.667 --> 38:48.750
so congrats.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.500
- Really?
So I should marry her?

38:52.333 --> 38:53.417
- Don't be juvenile.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.000
- Don't be juvenile.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.333
- I love you.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.542
- I just want to feel it.
I've never felt it before.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.458
- Okay, feel it.
- Okay.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.875
- You guys ready to f---ing get
nasty tonight, baby?

39:08.875 --> 39:10.042
- It's hot in here.
Where's the air con?

39:10.042 --> 39:11.542
- I don't know.
- Found it.

39:11.542 --> 39:13.042
- Let me do it.
- No, no, no, I've got it.

39:13.042 --> 39:14.542
- No. Let me do it.
- I literally just got it.

39:14.542 --> 39:16.792
- I know you do.

39:16.792 --> 39:20.875
- F---ing get up now.
- You f---ing idiot, right.

39:20.875 --> 39:23.042
- F---ing sh--.

39:23.042 --> 39:25.042
Someone needs a shot,

39:25.042 --> 39:26.042
apparently.

39:26.042 --> 39:27.500
- That's too funny.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.333
- Oh, yeah, let's plow him
with more alcohol.

39:30.333 --> 39:32.000
What a f---ing smart move.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.292
- I think it is.
- Yeah.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.458
- If everybody didn't get up
and leave.

39:44.417 --> 39:45.625
- I have to do it to you.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.917
- No, no, it's not.
It's not on your sheets.

39:48.917 --> 39:50.250
- We cool.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.708
- Ben seems happy.
And I'm happy.

39:52.708 --> 39:55.417
- You're both happy,
and it's very nice.

39:55.417 --> 39:57.833
- You've done well.
- Thank you.

39:57.833 --> 40:00.417
- He doesn't commit often
to many things.

40:00.417 --> 40:02.083
He doesn't like--

40:02.083 --> 40:04.583
- To be confined.
- By anything.

40:04.583 --> 40:06.542
- My trousers are--

40:06.542 --> 40:07.917
I don't know.
I just feel like--

40:07.917 --> 40:11.083
- Rules, bedtimes, uniforms.

40:11.083 --> 40:12.542
- All right,
take them off.

40:12.542 --> 40:14.375
- I feel like my trousers are
a little--

40:25.792 --> 40:26.667
- Ben, he doesn't like...

40:26.292 --> 40:26.667
- To be confined.

40:28.583 --> 40:29.583
I can sense that.
- By anything.

40:32.625 --> 40:34.083
I mean, I'm not saying forever,

40:34.083 --> 40:35.792
but for right now,
it's pretty cute.

40:35.792 --> 40:36.958
- It's fun.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.958
- Good night, you two.
I hope those boys have fun.

40:44.458 --> 40:46.042
- I love you.
- What a night.

40:46.042 --> 40:47.708
- All right, bub.
- See you, dude.

41:02.792 --> 41:04.208
- Yeah, baby.

41:04.208 --> 41:06.208
- Kate!
Come on in, girlfriend.

41:06.208 --> 41:08.333
- Come in and join us.
- I--no, I'm going to bed.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.667
But you guys have fun.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.375
And if there's a mess...

41:12.417 --> 41:13.583
- I know there won't be.

41:13.583 --> 41:15.042
- Okay.
- Love you!

41:16.500 --> 41:17.917
- Wahh!

41:17.917 --> 41:19.500
- Ow.
- What the hell?

41:19.500 --> 41:21.458
- The crew's partying
like it's 1999.

41:21.458 --> 41:24.833
I just hope this is not another
pizza-on-the-floor incident.

41:24.833 --> 41:26.000
- Whoa.

41:27.958 --> 41:29.167
- No.
You're fine.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.333
- We're fine.

41:32.333 --> 41:34.458
- Lauren has no respect
for the interior,

41:34.458 --> 41:36.167
and that's just not the f---ing
way to be.

41:36.167 --> 41:38.167
It's my f---ing night
in the master.

41:38.167 --> 41:40.500
You're not appreciating my time.

41:40.500 --> 41:44.458
- I just walked down the dock
completely ass-out

41:44.458 --> 41:46.750
'cause it was f---ing funny.

41:46.750 --> 41:50.042
- Ben, put some clothes on,
for God's sake.

41:50.042 --> 41:51.125
- I'm wasted!

41:58.042 --> 41:59.542
- I need to pee.

41:59.542 --> 42:01.042
- Yeah, you do.

42:02.875 --> 42:03.917
You love that.

42:10.542 --> 42:13.042
- And my brother,
he was breaking my ass up.

42:13.042 --> 42:15.042
- Oh! F---.

42:15.042 --> 42:16.792
- Oh, sh--.
- Are you all right?

42:16.792 --> 42:18.875
- This came out.
I think this came out.

42:18.875 --> 42:20.958
It needs to be reglued.
- It's broken.

42:20.958 --> 42:23.875
- It's gonna take
serious attention.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.875
- We are absolutely f---ed.

42:28.708 --> 42:30.375
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:30.375 --> 42:33.875
- Mr. Slover is back.
Somebody we all know and love.

42:33.875 --> 42:35.750
- This just didn't have--
didn't have a lot of flavor.

42:35.750 --> 42:39.250
- It's the only dish
that has ever been sent back.

42:39.250 --> 42:41.875
- There's a panel in the
bathroom that's off the wall.

42:41.875 --> 42:43.750
- This is not your personal
f---ing party palace.

42:43.750 --> 42:46.917
You four are gonna be confined
to the crew area.

42:46.917 --> 42:48.750
- Kate can go f--- herself.

42:48.750 --> 42:50.250
- Wait, do you think
Kate framed us?

42:50.250 --> 42:51.708
- She definitely did this.

42:51.708 --> 42:54.583
- What can I do with my brother?

42:54.583 --> 42:55.958
This is f---ing ridiculous.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.917
- Watch the bow, please.
God damn it! F---.

42:59.917 --> 43:01.417
I expected us to be
further along

43:01.417 --> 43:02.917
this far into the season.

43:02.917 --> 43:05.250
I'm gonna make some alterations.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.917
in bed, 10:00.
Everybody.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.417
- You're in bed by 10:00?
- Yeah, yeah.

43:08.417 --> 43:10.083
- Really? Really?
- You know what, guess what?

43:10.083 --> 43:11.583
- Don't come at me telling me--
- I can come at you

43:11.583 --> 43:13.125
however the f--- I want.
- You know what, do it!

43:13.125 --> 43:15.542
