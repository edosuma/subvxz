00:02.003 --> 00:03.959
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:04.046 --> 00:05.172
[wet thud]

00:07.008 --> 00:09.715
[George] Hang on, Naomi,
we’ll get you back here ASAP.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.008
I'm sorry, George.

00:11.095 --> 00:13.677
Just tell my sister that I love her.

00:15.433 --> 00:19.017
- You killed Naomi!
- She wants her people to come here.

00:19.103 --> 00:21.970
And trust me, when they do,
we had better be far away from here.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.851
If you want to live,
you need to come with me.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.319
No one's going anywhere
with you, John.

00:34.452 --> 00:37.194
- What are you doing?
- Same thing I've always done, Kate.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.119
Surviving.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.705
Thunder's getting louder.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.999
[helicopter]

00:53.262 --> 00:55.594
[static]

00:55.681 --> 00:57.672
[Pinging]

01:01.646 --> 01:04.058
[man #1 on radio] Sorry, Ron.

01:04.148 --> 01:08.482
Drone’s got nothing but seafood
at 5,000 meters below.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.273
You pickin’ anything up with yours?

01:13.491 --> 01:14.651
[Ron] Zip.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.859
I’m trying to get her a peek
over this ridge as soon as / can.

01:17.954 --> 01:20.286
Sonar's pinging up something now.

01:21.290 --> 01:24.077
- You want to switch feeds?
- [man #1] Roger that.

01:26.504 --> 01:30.338
I’m headed on a bearing
of about 137

01:30.424 --> 01:33.211
from the coordinates
we pulled off our guy’s map,

01:33.302 --> 01:35.293
but don't hold your breath.

01:38.182 --> 01:41.970
Magnetometer’s picking up a hell
of a lot of anomalies down here.

01:42.645 --> 01:46.103
- [Ron] A chest full of doubloons?
- [man #1] Keep dreaming, Ron.

01:46.190 --> 01:49.182
Let's swing around on the next grid
and recalibrate.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.273
[Ron] Are you getting this?

01:53.364 --> 01:55.650
[man #1] What? What’s up?

01:57.910 --> 02:00.868
[Ron] It’s... It’s an airplane.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.291
Oh, my God.

02:08.379 --> 02:11.712
It's Oceanic 815.

02:17.722 --> 02:21.010
[woman on TV] This haunting footage
comes to us from the Christiane l,

02:21.100 --> 02:23.056
a salvage vehicle in the Indian Ocean.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.726
For more than two months
it’s been scouring the depths

02:25.813 --> 02:28.646
of the Sunda Trench off Bali
in search of the remains

02:28.733 --> 02:30.269
of sunken trading ships.

02:30.359 --> 02:35.774
Late last night the Christiane deployed
two remote/y operated vehicles, RO Vs,

02:35.865 --> 02:40.655
that veriﬁed what the National
Transportation Safety Board long feared,

02:40.745 --> 02:42.701
[woman] How do you want
your eggs, Dan?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.824
- [sobs]
- [woman on TV continues]

02:44.915 --> 02:49.158
So, what happened?
They found that missing plane?

02:49.253 --> 02:52.837
- Dan?
- Oceanic 815 did crash at sea.

02:52.923 --> 02:56.006
- Dan?
- Even with this tragic discovery...

02:56.093 --> 02:58.960
Dan, why are you so upset?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.509
I don't know.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.683
- [thunder]
- [crackling]

03:08.522 --> 03:10.934
- I can't find my vest!
- Check under your seat!

03:11.025 --> 03:13.016
- [woman] I already did!
- Get ready!

03:13.110 --> 03:16.318
- Here, just take mine.
- All right!

03:16.405 --> 03:18.270
Everybody out, now!

03:18.741 --> 03:21.278
- Hey, genius! Go!
- No! No!

03:22.286 --> 03:25.244
- Go!
- [Dan shouting]

03:29.877 --> 03:32.619
[panting]

03:34.131 --> 03:35.917
[grunting]

03:37.093 --> 03:38.333
[groans]

03:39.720 --> 03:42.132
- [branch snaps]
- [gaSpS]

03:51.065 --> 03:53.147
[many branches snapping]

03:54.318 --> 03:56.559
[panting]

04:10.918 --> 04:14.001
Hey, there. Are you Jack?

04:18.134 --> 04:19.795
Yeah. I'm Jack.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.798
Who are you?

04:26.517 --> 04:28.348
I'm Daniel Faraday.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.725
I'm here to rescue you.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.974
Hey, Dan. The chopper,
how many of you were on it?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.800
Uh, four, including me.

05:11.896 --> 05:14.888
So, what happened to the rest of them?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.439
Yeah, yeah. I, uh,
I have no idea.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.484
I don't know how many of them
were able to get out before it...

05:20.571 --> 05:23.438
...went down. ljust,
ljumped, and I lost my, uh...

05:23.532 --> 05:26.148
What do you call it? My, my pack.
My phone was in my bag.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.235
- If I had my phone, lwould just, uh...
- We have a phone.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.075
[Dan] You, you have a phone. Uh...

05:33.709 --> 05:35.791
- [Kate chuckles]
- Thank you.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.869
[phone beeps]

05:38.839 --> 05:41.330
- [George] Minkowski.
- Hey, George, it's Daniel.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.461
Dan? The chopper comm went dead.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.713
- What happened up there?
- Yeah, I don't know.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.841
[stammers] There was an electrical
storm. All the instruments,

05:48.933 --> 05:52.721
lthink they went down. But, listen, I
made contact with some of the survivors,

05:52.811 --> 05:55.769
- and, uh, we were just, uh...
- Dan, am I on speaker?

05:59.902 --> 06:03.144
Would you give me just,
just one second? [scoffs]

06:05.866 --> 06:06.981
[quietly] Hey...

06:07.076 --> 06:10.284
- [unintelligible]
- Don't worry. Naomi covered for us.

06:11.497 --> 06:14.864
- They don't know what Locke did to her.
- You sure about that?

06:21.715 --> 06:25.128
OK, OK, so the boat hasn't heard
from anybody else yet,

06:25.219 --> 06:29.679
but, uh, there are GPS transponders,
my team and l are all wearing these.

06:29.765 --> 06:33.178
The transponders will send
the locations back to the ship,

06:33.269 --> 06:37.729
and the ship will send all locations
back in to the phones.

06:37.815 --> 06:40.272
- [phone beeps]
- Uh, that's my signal, right there,

06:40.359 --> 06:43.817
and we'll hopefully get the signals
from the rest of the team soon.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.237
- Will you help me find them?
- Absolutely.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.404
[Dan] OK. Thank you.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.529
Hey, where are the rest of your people?

06:54.623 --> 06:58.115
- Most of them are back at the beach.
- Most of them?

07:13.392 --> 07:17.351
Dude, what's wrong with you?
You're gonna get struck by lightning.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.931
The storm is about to pass, Hugo.

07:23.027 --> 07:25.188
It's a freakin' monsoon. We gotta...

07:31.994 --> 07:33.359
Let's go.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.504
Why are you going east?

07:45.591 --> 07:48.253
I thought you said the barracks
were due south.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.835
Because, James, we have to make
a little detour first.

07:50.929 --> 07:54.797
- Detour to what?
- There's a cabin l have to go to.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.258
I thought the cabin was back that way.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.684
What did you say, Hugo?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.892
Um...

08:03.567 --> 08:06.934
l, uh, thought you were talking
about the airplane cabin.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.280
Why are we wasting our time
going to some shack, anyway?

08:12.368 --> 08:14.404
- Because we're supposed to.
- Right.

08:14.495 --> 08:18.079
Like you were supposed to throw
a knife into that Naomi chick's back?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.536
Uh-huh.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.412
You mind us who you're getting
your orders from, Colonel Kurtz?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.415
I got 'em from Walt.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.602
Jack still isn't back.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.893
Anything?

08:50.406 --> 08:53.022
No. But it's a big island.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.950
The freighter could be approaching
from the other side.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.027
That's the spirit.

09:03.460 --> 09:07.123
Why would Ben say the people
coming here intend to do us harm?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.715
Because he's a liar,

09:08.799 --> 09:11.632
and he's trying to scare us.
That's what Ben does.

09:13.929 --> 09:17.592
Or because the people coming here
intend to do us harm.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.969
How many guns do you have left?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.265
[beeps]

09:36.410 --> 09:39.197
Hey. Is that from your chopper?

09:40.122 --> 09:42.408
Um...

09:42.499 --> 09:43.909
Yeah, yeah, that, uh... Yeah.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.243
They reduced the weight load
when they started going down.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.545
[laughs nervously]
Guess that's why they pushed me out.

09:52.468 --> 09:53.958
What's this for?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.252
Um...

09:58.891 --> 10:03.260
I'm not in charge of,
uh, packing, so, um...

10:03.353 --> 10:05.935
- You're not, huh?
- We should, uh...

10:06.023 --> 10:09.060
Hey, Daniel, why'd you bring the gun?

10:10.861 --> 10:12.101
[Dan] Uh...

10:14.990 --> 10:16.730
Uh, as a precaution.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.362
Precaution against what?

10:24.041 --> 10:25.997
Uh, OK, see, um...

10:27.920 --> 10:30.662
Rescuing you and your people...

10:32.007 --> 10:35.591
...I can't really say
it's our primary objective.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.086
Then what is?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.468
[phone beeps]

10:47.272 --> 10:49.103
[Dan] lt's Miles.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.898
lt's Miles. Come on.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.523
What the hell you mean
you saw Walt? In a dream?

10:55.614 --> 10:57.650
No dream. It was Walt.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.608
Only... taller.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.909
Taller? What, like a giant?

11:06.291 --> 11:10.079
- OK, what exactly did Walt tell you?
- He said I had work to do,

11:10.170 --> 11:14.163
that I had to stop this woman Naomi from
bringing the rest of her people here.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.340
You didn't ask him follow-up questions?

11:16.426 --> 11:19.168
Ben had shot me and left me for dead.
Walt saved my life,

11:19.263 --> 11:21.549
so I pretty much took him at his word.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.638
He shot you,

11:23.725 --> 11:27.309
yet here you are, fit as a fiddle,
tromping through the jungle.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.771
The bullet went in one side,

11:31.859 --> 11:33.645
came out the other.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.193
I'd probably be dead
if I still had a kidney there.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.950
Anything else?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.316
He's down there.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.653
Hey, Miles!

12:22.993 --> 12:23.982
Miles!

12:38.175 --> 12:40.336
Is he dead?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.008
Back up, handsome.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.759
Wait, whoa, whoa!
Miles, take it easy, it's OK.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.715
They're here to help us.
It's OK, Miles.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.938
- They're just trying to help.
- Hey! Back away from him!

12:52.022 --> 12:54.604
- Hands where I can see 'em!
- Kate, it's all right.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.942
It's OK.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.476
You're Kate?

13:00.781 --> 13:02.487
You want to tell me where Naomi is?

13:04.743 --> 13:07.234
- What?
- Naomi, the woman you killed.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.533
Where is she?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.758
[man on TV] For the friends and families
of the passengers of Oceanic 815,

13:23.845 --> 13:26.632
this can only be described
as the worst-case scenario.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.635
With the plane accounted for
and a salvage mission unlike/y,

13:29.726 --> 13:33.935
authorities are conﬁrming
all 324 passengers dead.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.652
Ms. Gardner, I'm Miles Straume.

13:50.747 --> 13:54.285
- We spoke on the phone earlier.
- Oh, oh, please come in.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.301
- Which room is it?
- lt's upstairs at the end of the hall.

14:10.934 --> 14:14.518
| get paid in advance.
Two hundred, cash only.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.855
You told me a hundred...

14:15.939 --> 14:19.932
That was before my buddy at the police
told me your grandson was murdered.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.269
It's gonna be two hundred.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.316
Fine.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.798
No matter what you hear,
don't come up.

15:33.850 --> 15:37.559
You're not doing your grandmother
any good staying here, man.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.012
You're causing her a lot of pain.

15:44.694 --> 15:48.027
l... I want to go downstairs
and tell her you've gone,

15:48.115 --> 15:51.482
but the only way
I'm gonna be able to do that

15:51.576 --> 15:54.113
is if you tell me where it is.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.374
So where is it?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.871
[clattering]

16:38.832 --> 16:40.163
You can go now.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.584
Did it work?

16:50.093 --> 16:51.253
Yeah.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.966
He's at peace now.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.604
Here.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.895
You get a refund. Half off.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.106
Wasn't as tricky as I thought.

17:14.326 --> 17:15.987
Thank you.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.784
Thank you.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.364
Miles. Miles!
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

17:22.459 --> 17:24.541
What are you doing?
These are good people.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.960
Why'd Naomi use the damn code? Yeah.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.834
You remember when she said,
"Tell my sister I love her?"

17:29.925 --> 17:32.462
Well, she doesn't have a sister.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.338
That's what we're supposed to say

17:34.429 --> 17:37.045
if we get captured,
have a gun to our heads.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.974
Like right now Jack here would say,
"Tell my sister I love her."

17:41.061 --> 17:43.427
- You get it?
- We didn't kill your friend.

17:45.065 --> 17:49.024
- Then take me to her body.
- Miles, what about Charlotte? Frank?

17:49.110 --> 17:52.147
- Take me to Naomi.
- Naomi was killed, but not by us.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.901
It was... it was a man
by the name of John Locke.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.028
- He's not with us anymore.
- Kate, if I have to ask you again...

17:58.119 --> 18:00.371
Even if I took you to her body
you wouldn't know...

18:00.455 --> 18:01.865
I'll know!

18:03.124 --> 18:05.115
Now take me to her body.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.423
Alex.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.102
Alex, hey.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.689
- What?
- Something I need to tell you.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.607
Keep your mouth shut, Mr. Linus.

18:32.696 --> 18:37.315
Karl. Now, if you're gonna sleep with
my daughter I insist you call me Ben.

18:38.326 --> 18:41.489
Easy, kid. Guy'sjust
trying to get in your head.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.204
Go take a walk or something.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.916
- Mind if I ask you a question, James?
- Yeah, I do.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.137
Why'd you leave Kate behind?

18:58.221 --> 19:01.338
[scoffs] You're wasting your time, Yoda.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.513
I know it's not pleasant,
but let's face it,

19:05.603 --> 19:07.980
you really don't stand a chance now.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.480
Chance at what?

19:10.567 --> 19:13.809
James, look at yourself.

19:13.903 --> 19:17.316
Yes, on this island,
you're brave, daring, handsome.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.490
You're someone,
but if you left with them...

19:21.494 --> 19:25.078
...back in the real world
a lowlife scam artist like you

19:25.165 --> 19:28.157
could never compete
with a first-class surgeon.

19:29.210 --> 19:33.078
I think Kate was really upset when
you made your choice to come with us.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.837
Thank God she has Jack there
to comfort her...

19:40.889 --> 19:42.095
James!

19:43.266 --> 19:44.847
- Don't!
- Don't what?!

19:45.810 --> 19:48.517
Anyone want to tell me
why we're keeping this guy alive?

19:48.605 --> 19:52.348
We're keeping him alive because
he's been on this island longer than us,

19:52.442 --> 19:54.774
because he has information we need.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.603
Because, apart from his mouth,
he's completely harmless.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.562
His mouth put that hole in your gut?

20:00.867 --> 20:04.906
OK, James, let's, let's execute him
right here, right now,

20:04.996 --> 20:07.078
in front of his daughter.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.346
It's only a matter of time
before he gets us, Johnny.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.893
And I'll bet he's already figured out
how he's gonna do it.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.810
So you walk him.

21:04.848 --> 21:06.384
What's he doing?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.393
The light...

21:09.477 --> 21:12.059
...is strange out here, isn't it?

21:12.147 --> 21:16.311
It's kind of like it doesn't,
it doesn't scatter

21:16.401 --> 21:17.686
quite right.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.855
Dan?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.861
- Your name is Dan, right?
- Hmm.

21:26.744 --> 21:31.454
Listen, Dan, I know that you don't
want anybody to get hurt, right?

21:31.541 --> 21:34.578
So why don't you just put that away.

21:36.045 --> 21:40.755
Uh... because, um,
Miles would kill me.

21:41.384 --> 21:44.547
- We're just trying to help...
- Kate, you're wasting your breath.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.004
Let's just let this play out
and see what happens, OK?

21:53.897 --> 21:56.809
They didn't kill her.
It happened like they said it did.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.231
- [phone beeps]
- Hey.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.435
[Dan] lt's Charlotte. She's only
three kilometers from here.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.394
All right. Let's go get her.

22:05.909 --> 22:08.651
- I said let's go.
- You need to put the guns down.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.986
- What?
- Put the guns down.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.745
- Now why would I do that?
- Our friends are in the jungle now

22:15.835 --> 22:18.497
holding a gun at your head
and his head.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.331
l'll forget about the misunderstanding.
Put the guns down.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.882
- Come on, how stupid do you think I am?
- [gunshots]

22:35.438 --> 22:36.939
I don't know, Miles.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.981
How stupid are you?

23:00.797 --> 23:03.209
[chatter]

23:15.478 --> 23:18.185
How many different languages
do you have to read that in

23:18.273 --> 23:20.309
before you believe it's true?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.857
How many different languages are there?

23:23.987 --> 23:27.229
[man speaks French]

23:27.323 --> 23:29.063
He wants to know if we're lost.

23:29.158 --> 23:32.400
Remind him people in our line
of work are terrible at keeping secrets.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.453
- I know about the dig.
- [woman responds in French]

23:38.626 --> 23:42.210
- He said the site is closed.
- Then tell him to open it.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.560
Dinosaur?

24:00.982 --> 24:02.768
Not by a few million years.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.690
It's an Ursus maritimus.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.234
[woman] Wait, ursus, as in bear?

24:13.786 --> 24:17.449
Charlotte, we're in the desert.
This is a hoax, right?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.542
He wants to know what
you're doing with the hammer.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.619
Excavating.

24:24.714 --> 24:28.548
[man continues in French]

24:31.012 --> 24:32.752
Is that a collar?

24:36.893 --> 24:39.885
[man continues in French]

24:41.022 --> 24:42.728
[gasps]

24:59.791 --> 25:01.406
[groans]

25:05.922 --> 25:07.503
Unh!

25:31.948 --> 25:33.779
[gasps]

25:53.803 --> 25:55.134
Hi.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.964
Hi yourself.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.898
We were worried
when you didn't get back,

26:08.985 --> 26:11.897
so we went out to the cockpit
and tracked you from there.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.944
Thanks for that, for what it's worth.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.020
Don't mention it.

26:15.116 --> 26:18.449
Somebody could've told me
that the cavalry were here.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.736
I gave you that... wink.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.407
What are your names?

26:26.502 --> 26:28.914
Um, I'm Daniel Faraday,
and this is Miles...

26:29.005 --> 26:30.495
Don't tell him my last name.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.505
I guess this is just Miles.

26:33.593 --> 26:36.585
- What do you do for a living, Daniel?
- I'm a physicist.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.510
I guess you can call me a physicist.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.805
I don't really like being pigeonholed...

26:40.892 --> 26:43.759
Dan, you say one more word
and I'll break your fingers.

26:43.853 --> 26:46.515
- What do you do, Miles?
- I collect soil samples.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.097
Oh, that's nice.
Well, maybe you can help me.

26:49.192 --> 26:51.604
You say you're not here
on a rescue mission,

26:51.694 --> 26:54.310
and the world at large
believes us to be dead.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.938
But here we are, alive and well,

26:57.033 --> 26:59.775
and you don't seem
remotely surprised to see us.

26:59.869 --> 27:04.238
Oh, my God, you guys were on
Oceanic flight 815! Wow!

27:04.332 --> 27:05.913
That better?

27:10.171 --> 27:12.162
I can't believe you're alive.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.964
How many of you are there?

27:17.470 --> 27:19.256
Why do you want to know?

27:20.223 --> 27:21.713
Why wouldn't I want to know?

27:25.812 --> 27:27.928
Forty-eight of us survived the crash.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.978
That's not counting the tail section.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.182
- They're pretty much dead...
- [Locke] Hugo.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.736
So you've all been living here
this entire time?

27:38.241 --> 27:39.651
Is that your baby?

27:40.910 --> 27:42.571
Yeah. This is Aaron.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.574
- Did you have him here on the island?
- Mm-hmm.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.246
That's amazing.

27:48.584 --> 27:52.452
Well, I've got about a million
more questions I want to ask you,

27:52.547 --> 27:55.334
but they can wait until
we get you back to the freighter.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.086
We've all got
one of these transponders,

27:58.177 --> 28:00.634
so if we sit tight
they're gonna be here soon, OK?

28:00.721 --> 28:03.588
This team of yours,
how many of you are there?

28:04.600 --> 28:05.851
Four, including me.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.894
- What happened to your helicopter?
- I don't know.

28:09.981 --> 28:12.848
- The pilot was trying to put it down.
- Where?

28:12.942 --> 28:14.933
I don't know.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.484
I had to jump. It was chaos.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.401
I'm lucky to be alive.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.448
Get up. You're coming with us.

28:27.290 --> 28:30.874
What? Why? We need to stay
where we are so that they can find us.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.575
See, there's your problem.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.626
We don't want to be found.

28:37.967 --> 28:39.628
[phone beeping]

28:39.719 --> 28:42.085
I wouldn't mess around with that
if I were you.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.431
It can't hurt to try and call
someone else.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.221
- Oh, it can hurt.
- [phone beeps]

28:46.309 --> 28:49.016
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.811
Your friend Charlotte,

28:52.899 --> 28:55.732
- she's moving.
- [beeping accelerates]

28:55.818 --> 28:57.399
And she's moving fast.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.273
She's running from something.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.844
According to this she's right here.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.600
- Charlotte?
- Charlotte!

29:42.698 --> 29:45.110
[rustling]

29:45.201 --> 29:46.862
Over there, over there.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.205
Vincent.

30:01.384 --> 30:02.590
Locke's got her.

30:19.235 --> 30:23.979
[man] We want to caution our viewers
the images are graphic in nature.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.984
Viewer discretion is advised.

30:26.075 --> 30:29.317
Authorities released footage
of the sunken remains

30:29.412 --> 30:31.994
of Oceanic flight 815.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.290
The National Transportation
Safety Board has set up a hotline

30:36.377 --> 30:39.619
for family members
of the Oceanic victims.

30:39.714 --> 30:43.047
The NTSB has begun
the victim identiﬁcation process.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.210
We have conﬁrmation
that this is the pilot,

30:47.304 --> 30:50.091
Captain Seth Norris.

30:50.182 --> 30:54.095
In a statement,
the NTSB said that,

30:54.186 --> 30:56.723
"Due to the sheer depth of the wreck...

30:57.940 --> 31:00.898
...recovery of the bodies
would be next to impossible.

31:00.985 --> 31:04.102
We can only hope that identiﬁcation
will provide closure

31:04.196 --> 31:06.278
to the families of the victims. "

31:17.793 --> 31:21.035
[woman] National Transportation Safety
Board, Oceanic hotline.

31:21.130 --> 31:22.791
Let me speak to your supervisor.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.498
Yes, sir. Are you a family member
of the deceased?

31:25.593 --> 31:27.879
No, but I got some information
on the crash.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.552
- May I speak to your supervisor?
- Sir, if you could...

31:30.639 --> 31:32.675
Look, I'm staring at the television now,

31:32.767 --> 31:36.601
you're broadcasting footage and saying
that's the pilot, Seth Norris.

31:36.687 --> 31:37.676
Yes, sir?

31:37.772 --> 31:39.478
Well, that's not him.

31:41.942 --> 31:43.318
Please hold.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.936
- [man] Who am I speaking with?
- Doesn't matter.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.943
You're showing footage of Seth Norris.
That's not him.

31:50.034 --> 31:54.027
He married his high school sweetheart
at 19, he always wore his wedding ring.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.952
There's no ring on that body.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.454
- Sir, it’s likely the ring fell off...
- I'm telling you that is not him.

32:01.378 --> 32:05.041
And how exactly is it that you know
all about Captain Norris?

32:06.675 --> 32:10.509
Because I was supposed to be flying
Oceanic 815 on that day.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.456
[grunts]

32:40.543 --> 32:42.579
[panting]

32:46.382 --> 32:47.588
[moos]

33:06.735 --> 33:08.236
[grunts]

33:19.957 --> 33:22.573
[panting]

33:33.762 --> 33:34.797
That's them.

33:34.889 --> 33:37.005
That's somebody from my team.

33:42.104 --> 33:45.346
What's wrong with you people?
We're here because of you.

33:45.441 --> 33:47.523
| just almost died jumping out
of a helicopter

33:47.610 --> 33:49.942
because you called us for help.

33:50.112 --> 33:53.195
Maybe we should see
who launched that flare.

33:53.282 --> 33:55.864
- They could be hurt, John.
- She's lying.

33:55.951 --> 33:59.489
Whatever they came for, it isn't us.
We keep moving fonivard as planned.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.697
[Sawyer] Sure. Who are we to argue
with Taller Ghost Walt?

34:02.791 --> 34:05.498
- Do whatever you want.
- I want you to come with us.

34:05.586 --> 34:08.749
I'm not asking for permission.
If you think you're gonna stop me

34:08.839 --> 34:10.704
- from getting to my...
- [gunshot]

34:14.637 --> 34:16.093
[grunts]

34:17.056 --> 34:19.468
[Sawyer] What did you do,
you son of a bitch?

34:24.688 --> 34:26.394
[gasps]

34:28.692 --> 34:31.069
- The vest.
- What?

34:31.153 --> 34:32.518
Vest.

34:32.613 --> 34:33.728
Vest.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.255
- [Dan] Is he alive?
- [Jack] He's got a pulse.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.045
Frank?

34:52.925 --> 34:54.756
Frank. Hey, hey.

34:54.843 --> 34:56.174
- Frank!
- [grunts]

34:58.847 --> 35:01.008
Are you OK? What happened?

35:03.519 --> 35:07.103
- We got struck by lightning.
- Frank, where's Charlotte?

35:07.189 --> 35:09.976
She bailed out just...
before we went down.

35:10.067 --> 35:13.275
- I don't know where she is.
- Where's the chopper?

35:13.362 --> 35:14.522
I saw a cow.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.366
Hey! Hey!

35:18.450 --> 35:21.157
Lapidus, where's the chopper?
Where did it crash?

35:21.245 --> 35:24.112
Crash? What the hell kind of pilot
do you think I am?

35:24.206 --> 35:26.663
I put her down safe and sound
right over there.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.733
[Naomi] So this is the team?

35:58.824 --> 36:01.691
[man] Have you familiarized yourself
with their profiles?

36:01.785 --> 36:03.321
[Naomi] Unfortunately, yes.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.903
These are the wrong people
for a mission like this.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.990
None of them have field experience,
military training.

36:09.084 --> 36:12.372
You can't just drop them in
unprotected. It'll be a disaster.

36:12.463 --> 36:14.795
They are not unprotected.
They have you.

36:14.882 --> 36:17.294
[scoffs] There's only so much I can do.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.002
Your modesty is positively charming.

36:21.096 --> 36:24.964
This is a high-risk covert op
in unstable territory.

36:25.059 --> 36:28.051
lt's dodgy enough without
having to baby-sit a head case,

36:28.145 --> 36:30.261
ghostbuster, anthropologist
and a drunk.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.438
To be fair he is also
a pretty good pilot.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.855
lt's madness.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.399
What if we find survivors from 815?

36:36.487 --> 36:38.819
- There were no survivors.
- Yes, I know.

36:38.906 --> 36:42.364
- But what if there are survivors?
- There were no survivors

36:42.451 --> 36:44.112
of Oceanic 815.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.195
Don't ask questions.
Just do what you were hired for.

36:47.289 --> 36:50.452
Every member of this team
was selected for a specific purpose.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.659
Everything relies on you
getting them in, getting them out

36:53.754 --> 36:56.291
and preventing anyone
from getting killed.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.213
Think you can do that?

37:00.969 --> 37:02.300
Sure.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.049
Why not?

37:24.410 --> 37:25.741
Well?

37:25.828 --> 37:29.537
There's some minor damage, but
the mechanical systems are intact.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.998
- So it will fly, then?
- Absolutely.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.956
Can I have the phone now?

37:37.005 --> 37:39.542
Tell you what. I'll give you the phone

37:39.633 --> 37:42.249
if you tell me what you people
are doing here.

37:42.344 --> 37:45.552
I'll tell you what we're doing here
if you give me the phone.

37:49.893 --> 37:52.054
Don't say anything about your sister.

37:52.146 --> 37:54.558
[phone beeps]

37:54.648 --> 37:57.105
- [woman] Hello?
- Regina, it's Miles.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.898
I need to talk to Minkowski.

37:58.986 --> 38:01.443
Minkowski can't come
to the phone right now.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.233
It's important. Go get him.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.701
Miles, he can't come
to the phone right now.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.947
All right, have him call me
when he can.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.448
I gotta go.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.954
Whoa, whoa! What are you
doing with her?

38:17.045 --> 38:20.378
- We're taking her with us.
- What's the point? That's not Naomi.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.048
- It's just meat.
- We can't just leave her here.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.545
Miles is right.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.462
We burned up most of the damn fuel
flying around in that storm.

38:28.557 --> 38:31.640
We barely got enough
to get back to the freighter.

38:31.727 --> 38:36.061
We're not gonna carry any unnecessary
weight. I'll take her on the next run.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.059
I promise, Dan.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.648
There's a blanket by my backpack.
Would you get it?

38:43.739 --> 38:44.899
Yeah.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.481
[Lapidus] Look as bad as it feels?

38:47.576 --> 38:49.316
[Juliet] How bad does it feel?

38:49.411 --> 38:51.322
[chuckles]

38:51.413 --> 38:53.574
- What's your name again?
- Juliet.

38:54.625 --> 38:57.367
Juliet. Juliet what?

38:58.420 --> 38:59.830
Juliet Burke.

38:59.922 --> 39:01.787
Juliet Burke.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.381
You weren't on that plane, were you?

39:08.597 --> 39:10.087
Miles!

39:11.433 --> 39:12.798
Yeah?

39:12.893 --> 39:16.181
This is Juliet,
and she was not on the plane.

39:17.606 --> 39:18.812
What?!

39:20.108 --> 39:21.063
You sure?

39:21.151 --> 39:23.984
You know how many times
I studied that damn manifest?

39:24.071 --> 39:27.063
There's no Juliet Burke on that plane.
She's a native.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.527
Really? Where is he?!

39:29.618 --> 39:31.609
- Back off!
- Where's who?

39:31.703 --> 39:34.445
You want to know why we're here?
I'll tell you why.

39:36.792 --> 39:39.454
We're here for Benjamin Linus.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.423
Now where is he?

39:48.595 --> 39:50.426
James, listen to me, please.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.551
- Keep your mouth shut.
- [Locke] Are you OK?

39:53.642 --> 39:56.884
I feel like I've got a cinder block
on my chest, but I'll survive.

39:56.979 --> 40:00.142
I'm sorry you got shot.
I didn't intend for that to happen.

40:00.232 --> 40:03.474
Really? It seemed like you were
about to shoot me yourself.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.230
What good would you be to me dead?

40:06.321 --> 40:08.983
[sarcastic] I feel much more
comfortable now. Thanks.

40:11.994 --> 40:15.532
I guess this is the part where
I'm supposed to say, "I told you so."

40:16.832 --> 40:18.322
James, I stand corrected.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.585
You want me to do it?

40:21.461 --> 40:24.168
No, it's my mess. I'll clean up.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.592
- No! Wait!
- Danielle, escort Alex away from here.

40:30.679 --> 40:32.340
- Let's go. Come on.
- No! No!

40:32.431 --> 40:33.466
She's right. Let's go.

40:33.557 --> 40:36.094
Anyone who doesn't want to see this
should leave now.

40:36.184 --> 40:37.515
We should talk about this...

40:37.603 --> 40:40.936
Claire, what if one of those bullets
had hit you or the baby?

40:41.023 --> 40:42.638
John, listen.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.316
I have information that you need.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.522
I have answers.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.569
What is the monster?

40:54.703 --> 40:57.365
- What?
- The black smoke, the monster.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.371
What is it?

41:00.667 --> 41:02.043
I don't know.

41:03.337 --> 41:06.374
- Goodbye, Benjamin.
- Her name is Charlotte Lewis!

41:10.719 --> 41:12.801
Charlotte Staples Lewis.

41:14.056 --> 41:17.514
Born July 2, 1979,
Essex, England.

41:17.601 --> 41:20.809
Parents David and Jeannette.
Eldest of three, all girls.

41:21.647 --> 41:24.980
She was raised in Bromsgrove.
Did her undergraduate studies at Kent.

41:25.067 --> 41:28.651
Took her Ph.D.
in cultural anthropology at Oxford.

41:28.737 --> 41:31.479
She's here with two other
team members and a pilot.

41:31.573 --> 41:34.610
Their names: Daniel Faraday,
Miles Straume,

41:34.701 --> 41:36.407
Frank Lapidus.

41:44.378 --> 41:47.165
Your instinct was right, John.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.416
These people are a threat.

41:50.592 --> 41:54.676
If you shoot me, you'll never know
how great a threat they were.

41:54.763 --> 41:57.550
Because I know what they're doing here.

41:57.641 --> 41:59.256
I know what they want.

42:00.268 --> 42:01.769
What do they want?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.937
Me, James. They want me.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.691
How do you know all this?

42:21.081 --> 42:23.948
Because I have a man on their boat.
