WEBVTT

00:00.850 --> 00:02.980
Previously, on damages...

00:02.990 --> 00:06.140
I'm agent harrison. This is
agent werner. We're with the fbi.

00:06.150 --> 00:08.320
You just want to arrest patty hewes.

00:08.330 --> 00:09.550
I want to destroy her.

00:09.590 --> 00:13.130
If I go public with what I know,
it could bring down an industry.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.140
Do you think your firm killed christine?

00:16.170 --> 00:17.770
Detective victor huntley, please?

00:17.810 --> 00:19.580
What is this in regard to?

00:19.630 --> 00:21.260
I killed my wife.

00:21.270 --> 00:25.230
Unr is using their power to
manipulate energy prices for profit.

00:25.270 --> 00:30.400
Kendrick is intermittently shutting
down power plants to drive up prices.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.000
Each entry corresponds to a brownout.

00:33.050 --> 00:37.910
And each brownout coincides
with a futures trade made by...

00:37.960 --> 00:38.980
Finn garrety.

00:39.020 --> 00:41.060
Dave, the car was stolen.

00:41.100 --> 00:45.870
So even if patty hewes managed
to figure out what's on the gps,

00:45.910 --> 00:47.910
it won't be admissible in court.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.810
Ellen parsons is getting closer.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.970
Take her out.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.860
She's not gonna use
me to bribe the judge.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.250
I think she's gonna use tom instead.

00:55.290 --> 00:56.430
Arrest him.

00:56.470 --> 00:57.730
How long you been lying to my face?

00:57.760 --> 01:00.280
We know she's planning to
use you to bribe judge oliver.

01:00.330 --> 01:04.150
Tell him you'll make it all go away
if he refuses to make the bribe.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.070
Then patty will be forced to use me.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.480
- Just this once, I-i cannot do
it! - I understand! I understand!

01:11.490 --> 01:12.670
You're fired.

01:12.700 --> 01:16.890
You see enemies everywhere, but you can't
see the people who actually care about you.

01:16.930 --> 01:18.550
I met with judge oliver.

01:18.570 --> 01:21.180
You were right-- I
think he'll play ball.

01:25.530 --> 01:28.810
So, it seems like you're not
gonna tell me the truth after all.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.160
That's okay.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.180
I lied, too.

02:51.100 --> 02:54.970
Your honor, mr. Betancourt
is our new general counsel.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.420
He's ably taken the
reins from ms. Maddox.

02:58.750 --> 03:02.120
Well, then I trust it, uh, won't
be necessary to delay this case.

03:02.150 --> 03:04.660
N-no, your honor, I am
entirely up to speed.

03:04.700 --> 03:09.860
And I see this motion as a matter of
ethical constraints, pure and simple.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.860
The only pure and simple thing about
this case is your client's malfeasance.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.660
Malfeasance? Really?

03:18.110 --> 03:24.650
Your honor, ms. Hewes is in violation of
the new york disciplinary rule 1-dash-102a,

03:24.660 --> 03:27.320
subsections three, four and five.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.830
You have no proof of that.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.630
The evidence ms. Hewes has proffered could
only have come from the suv in question,

03:33.640 --> 03:37.900
and the only way she could have
procured it is through criminal means.

03:38.490 --> 03:40.120
She stole the car.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.450
That is ludicrous.

03:42.460 --> 03:48.590
And I intend to present witnesses corroborating
unr's involvement in fraudulent commodities trading.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.490
Forget about your witnesses.

03:50.530 --> 03:55.810
Would you have this corroboration without the
information extracted illegally from the vehicle?

03:55.840 --> 03:58.240
All right, enough.
I'll read your briefs.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.170
Then I'll let you know...

04:01.180 --> 04:05.300
whether this, uh, suv
evidence is admissible.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.720
You'll hear from me again
after I've made my ruling.

04:08.730 --> 04:10.970
- Thank you, your honor.
- Thank you.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.650
Ms.Hewes?

04:14.950 --> 04:17.709
Based on what I've heard so far...

04:18.130 --> 04:20.630
I'm inclined to side with the defense.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.350
I understand, your honor.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.360
Patty? You wanted to see me?

04:35.340 --> 04:38.240
The judge needs these
to make his ruling.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.680
I want you to file this.

04:40.690 --> 04:43.220
- What is it?
- The gps codes.

04:43.230 --> 04:45.090
They'll be inadmissible.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.550
Just do it.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.230
Have you made arrangements
with judge oliver?

04:51.540 --> 04:54.430
Why did you fire tom?

04:54.880 --> 04:57.440
I'd prefer not to talk about that.

04:57.450 --> 05:00.730
He wouldn't go through
with it, would he?

05:05.550 --> 05:07.500
Let me do this for you.

05:07.510 --> 05:10.250
I told you, I don't want you involved.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.870
You're being investigated--
you can't do it yourself.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.730
Who says I'm gonna do it at all?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.110
What is the alternative?

05:16.160 --> 05:20.880
The alternative... is to believe
in our case and trust the system.

05:20.890 --> 05:23.150
Judge oliver doesn't
believe in the system.

05:23.180 --> 05:25.400
He believes in money.

05:31.850 --> 05:34.210
All right, ellen.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.350
Find out what his terms are.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.810
Did you do it?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.400
Ellen parsons...

05:55.440 --> 05:57.610
is alive and well.

05:58.980 --> 06:01.000
That's disappointing.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.250
Not gonna do it.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.360
You just made a big decision.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.510
I don't care what you do to me.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.570
I'm out.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.720
And good luck finding me.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.680
Thanks for coming.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.850
How's the baby?

06:30.880 --> 06:33.060
What do you want?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.780
I'm sorry... it had to be like this.

06:36.790 --> 06:39.080
- Are you?
- Yes.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.820
But you're better off this way.

06:42.850 --> 06:46.830
Oh, your ego is astonishing.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.730
Patty is going to jail, tom.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.190
The more distance you get from
her, the better off you are.

06:53.750 --> 06:58.730
I'll never be able to figure it out.In less
than six months you're in her inner circle,

06:58.740 --> 07:03.270
god knows why, and all you
had to do was stay loyal.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.590
- Oh, you think this is about loyalty?
- Look...

07:07.140 --> 07:12.010
patty is-is... is no saint--
she crosses the line sometimes.

07:12.020 --> 07:16.790
But she does it for a reason-- she fights for
people that nobody else gives a shit about.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.470
Why are you doing this to her?
What did she ever do to you?

07:34.980 --> 07:37.650
Don't do anything stupid, tom.

07:37.660 --> 07:41.790
You tip patty off, the feds can still
use everything they have against you.

08:50.170 --> 08:52.600
Wes, is that you?

08:59.910 --> 09:01.040
Wes?

09:01.050 --> 09:04.150
Yeah, it's me.

09:11.870 --> 09:14.200
You know, there's a
warrant out for your arrest.

09:14.230 --> 09:16.310
You stay away from her.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.780
The next time I see you,
there won't be a conversation.

09:23.140 --> 09:25.060
now leave.

09:25.070 --> 09:28.020
You can't proct her everywhere.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.200
So...

09:44.620 --> 09:46.850
you really did it?

09:48.930 --> 09:51.240
Yes.

09:58.730 --> 10:03.210
I know you can't help me with
aracite, but I still need you, daniel.

10:04.780 --> 10:08.650
You know how unr
conducted their business.

10:08.660 --> 10:11.670
You were privy to their fraud.

10:11.690 --> 10:14.670
You can still help
me to bring them down.

10:15.180 --> 10:18.290
You want the testimony of a murderer?

10:18.530 --> 10:22.890
Even if you killed christine,
they helped you cover it up.

10:24.010 --> 10:26.580
You'll never understand.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.000
Understand what?

10:29.020 --> 10:31.760
To find peace...

10:33.410 --> 10:37.400
I have to take full
responsibility for my sins.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.640
Forget your work, patty.

10:44.570 --> 10:47.700
Pay attention to your life.

10:49.740 --> 10:53.250
Your family. I mean,
it's too late for me.

10:57.960 --> 11:02.050
but there will be no more
betrayals, no more lies.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.520
I want my daughter to know...

11:12.510 --> 11:15.320
who I am.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.040
It must feel like you're
looking in a mirror.

11:23.050 --> 11:27.160
But there's a difference
between you and me.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.630
I've confessed.

11:36.310 --> 11:38.500
I got to go.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.880
Patty, wait.

11:47.580 --> 11:50.540
Tell michael...

11:52.970 --> 11:56.400
he doesn't have to be like us.

12:15.070 --> 12:20.190
This, uh, this gift
isn't for my personal use.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.700
It would be going straight
into my reelection campaign.

12:23.750 --> 12:27.060
We need to ensure the right
kind of judges stay on the bench.

12:27.070 --> 12:29.090
I agree.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.190
Looks like you've really
earned patty's trust.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.420
She knows that i believe
in what she's doing.

12:41.270 --> 12:44.910
Tell patty she can
contribute the usual amount.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.450
Thank you, your honor. I'll
let you know what she decides.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.220
How did it go with purcell?

13:01.960 --> 13:03.440
He won't be useful.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.580
Well, judge oliver's ready.

13:07.030 --> 13:08.470
What are his terms?

13:08.520 --> 13:11.140
He said "the usual."

13:13.400 --> 13:16.220
Should I tell him we're good?

13:18.360 --> 13:21.070
I don't know.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.690
There's something about it.

13:26.030 --> 13:28.350
Don't you think?

13:28.360 --> 13:31.140
What other choice do we have?

13:31.170 --> 13:33.350
We're out of options.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.660
There's no other way
to prove those trades.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.140
There's still one long shot.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.090
Yeah?

13:55.130 --> 13:56.960
- Mr. Garrety?
- Who are you?

13:56.970 --> 13:59.390
My name is patty hewes. I'm an attorney.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.510
- I'm not interested.
- I think you're going to want to talk to me.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.030
About what?

14:04.040 --> 14:07.670
The illegal energy trades
you made for walter kendrick.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.350
Never heard of him.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.950
Then let's talk about dave pell.

14:12.940 --> 14:16.360
I have a list of the stock
trades you made for mr. Pell.

14:16.610 --> 14:20.200
A man's wife was murdered
to protect your investments.

14:20.230 --> 14:24.740
And the company you've been trading has poisoned
thousands of people so you could turn your profits.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.450
I don't know anything about that.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.130
Maybe not. Anyway, I
don't care, mr. Garrety.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.380
I've been having one hell of a shitty
month, and someone is gonna pay.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.460
What do you want from me?

14:33.510 --> 14:38.020
I need you to corroborate how you used
gps coordinates to make your stock trades.

14:38.050 --> 14:39.780
I need you to testify.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.060
Why the hell would i do that?

14:42.100 --> 14:44.820
Because you're in
business with my enemies.

14:44.860 --> 14:47.190
And that's the last stupid
mistake you're gonna make.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.660
Listen, lady, you're lucky
I don't crack you in the jaw.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.810
Just ask around, mr. Garrety.

14:52.830 --> 14:57.660
Find out who I am, and then decide whose
side you want to be on-- theirs or mine.

14:57.670 --> 15:00.120
- Leave.
- Once.

15:00.820 --> 15:03.460
I'll make this offer once.

15:03.470 --> 15:08.150
You close this door, it
will never open again.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.690
Help me or you're going to
jail with the rest of them.

15:13.850 --> 15:16.550
I'll take my chances.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.870
Your choice.

15:33.370 --> 15:35.570
- Ms.Parsons.
- Yes?

15:36.790 --> 15:39.750
I'm detective rick messer, nypd.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.830
You look familiar.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.880
We met once before.

15:44.930 --> 15:47.920
I was working a string
of homicides downtown.

15:47.940 --> 15:50.570
Your fianc? s murder fit the profile.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.900
This is detective rick messer. He
asked if he could take a look around.

15:54.910 --> 15:58.990
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I hope they find the guy.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.900
Can we speak someplace private?

16:03.960 --> 16:06.560
Sure.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.330
His name is eliot tolken.

16:09.340 --> 16:12.490
He was a beat cop for
more than a decade.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.860
As you can see, his whereabouts
are currently unknown.

16:15.870 --> 16:19.350
But I have reason to believe he was involved
in the homicides i was investigating.

16:19.390 --> 16:21.740
And in the murder of my fianc?

16:21.780 --> 16:23.810
I want to help, ms. Parsons...

16:24.980 --> 16:27.310
but I'm not here in
an official capacity.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.790
Why are you here?

16:28.810 --> 16:32.090
Because if I'm right
and tolken was involved,

16:32.100 --> 16:36.690
then someone in my department may be
trying to stonewall my investigation.

16:37.970 --> 16:39.760
I see.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.810
I reopened your file.

16:41.850 --> 16:45.030
There is a partial print on the murder
weapon that was never identified.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.810
You think it's tolken's?

16:46.840 --> 16:49.360
I'm having it analyzed.

16:49.740 --> 16:53.500
I'm gonna solve this, ms. Parsons.

16:54.110 --> 16:57.390
But I suggest you keep this
conversation between us.

16:57.410 --> 17:02.300
Accusing a police officer of a crime
can be a very dangerous proposition.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.819
I understand.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.670
When the print comes
back, I'll be in touch.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.400
Thank you, detective.

17:22.390 --> 17:25.349
The detective who came
to see you is legit.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.400
How do you know?

17:27.410 --> 17:31.070
Rick messer has almost
20 years on the force,

17:31.080 --> 17:34.170
half a dozen commendations
and a sterling reputation.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.740
So we can trust him?

17:35.770 --> 17:39.600
Uh, I spoke to my contact
in the commissioner's office.

17:39.630 --> 17:41.900
Messer sounds like a stand-up guy.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.490
Good. He said he'd be in touch.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.300
This is what he had on officer tolken.

17:49.350 --> 17:51.960
You're sure this is the guy
that followed you on the street?

17:51.970 --> 17:52.930
Yes.

17:52.940 --> 17:55.010
- Can I hang onto this?
- Sure.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.780
We'll find out how this
guy connects to frobisher.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.660
I can't wait for you
to see this building.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.980
It's unbelievable, holly. They've got...

18:03.350 --> 18:06.490
they've got windmills on the roof. Yeah.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.400
Hey, ron, let me catch
up with you later.

18:08.430 --> 18:10.230
- I'm on the phone with
my ex-wife. - It's don.

18:10.240 --> 18:15.130
It's an environmentally responsible
leed-certified green building.

18:15.210 --> 18:18.100
Perfect headquarters for my new company.

18:18.650 --> 18:21.480
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

18:21.490 --> 18:25.350
Hey, I can't wait to
see you and the kids.

18:25.360 --> 18:29.350
I know-I know it's just a first
step, but I'm excited, babe.

18:29.390 --> 18:33.170
I-I tell you, the future's
looking bright again. Yeah!

18:34.450 --> 18:36.630
Hey, mom.

18:39.650 --> 18:42.050
I read your college essay.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.380
Oh, yeah? What did you think?

18:44.390 --> 18:46.930
- I was confused.
- Why?

18:46.940 --> 18:49.490
I told you I was writing
about daniel purcell.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.520
No.

18:51.560 --> 18:56.530
I was confused by the fact that all your
applications are still in your bedroom.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.880
Good. You went through my room.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.050
You never applied anywhere.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.110
Because I'm not going to college.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.090
Why not?

19:06.730 --> 19:09.480
For you, mom. Look at you.

19:10.290 --> 19:12.770
What is that supposed to mean?

19:12.790 --> 19:15.000
You need a man in your life.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.650
And you have no one left but me.

19:27.190 --> 19:28.910
Relax, walt.

19:28.930 --> 19:31.730
The judge won't be
ruling in patty's favor.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.260
I don't share your confidence.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.990
It doesn't matter anyway.
Patty's gonna bribe him.

19:37.740 --> 19:41.660
And when she does, the fbi
will be there to arrest her.

19:42.220 --> 19:44.340
How the hell do you know that?

19:44.400 --> 19:49.200
There's an informant in patty
hewes's firm working with the fbi.

19:52.110 --> 19:55.790
Goddamn, it's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.090
There's a finn garrety
here to see you, mr. Pell.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.210
What does he want?

20:00.260 --> 20:03.730
I have no idea. Send him in.

20:08.150 --> 20:10.360
Did you kill a woman?

20:11.580 --> 20:14.460
Oh, look, it's the asshole who runs unr.

20:14.470 --> 20:16.150
You don't want to talk to me like that.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.750
Really? Aren't you the
guy poisoning people?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.520
That's enough, mr. Garrety.

20:20.550 --> 20:23.380
Patty hewes came to see me.

20:23.390 --> 20:27.840
Wanted my testimony about
the trades we've been making.

20:27.880 --> 20:28.730
What'd you tell her?

20:28.770 --> 20:31.740
I told her to go screw herself, for now.

20:31.780 --> 20:32.440
For now?

20:32.490 --> 20:37.400
You put me smack in the middle
of a big pile of shit, gentlemen.

20:37.430 --> 20:42.160
I agreed to take your
codes, make some trades.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.610
You never told me
anything else was going on.

20:45.650 --> 20:47.740
What exactly do you want, mr. Garrety?

20:47.770 --> 20:51.280
Let's start with a piece of the
company, a major ownership stake.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.710
- You're out of your mind.
- Goddamn right.

20:53.720 --> 20:58.180
I'm a frickin' madman,
crazy enough to talk.

20:59.060 --> 21:04.540
You got 24 hours, or I cut
a deal with patty hewes.

21:21.420 --> 21:25.660
And I enjoy the diet. Everybody
has problems with diets today.

21:25.670 --> 21:30.020
They get bored with them, and
most diets, people don't stay on.

21:30.050 --> 21:34.670
People buy this machine because it's easy
to clean, but the food tastes so good.

21:34.700 --> 21:38.580
Now, if you're on a diet-- chicken,
fish or beef-- high protein.

21:38.610 --> 21:41.070
Well, that's what this machine
does: Chicken, fish or beef.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.410
So you always look
forward to eating the food.

21:44.440 --> 21:49.230
And that, I believe, is gonna encourage people to
stay on the diet, and that's the important thing.

21:49.270 --> 21:52.500
Now, once you reach that weight--
I've reached the weight already.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.970
In fact, I'm trying to gain a pound.
Then you start to increase the carbs.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.790
We can start eating a little bit...

22:01.030 --> 22:02.360
What's all this?

22:02.410 --> 22:07.640
Stefania's been going through uncle
pete's things, and she sent these over.

22:09.470 --> 22:12.300
Looks like some nice memories.

22:16.570 --> 22:19.100
Is this you?

22:50.300 --> 22:52.340
who's that?

22:54.870 --> 22:58.560
No idea. Never seen him before.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.930
Patty may bribe a judge.

23:11.940 --> 23:14.880
Feds could have her in custody soon.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.010
Congratulations.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.020
What's wrong?

23:24.870 --> 23:27.810
It's not enough.

23:27.820 --> 23:32.070
They arrest her for the bribe, she
goes to jail for a couple years, maybe.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.470
She'll be disbarred.

23:34.510 --> 23:37.100
She'll never practice law again.

23:41.210 --> 23:43.630
Do you still have frank's number?

23:43.860 --> 23:46.110
Frank?

23:46.130 --> 23:48.460
The guy who doesn't
get hung up on permits.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.550
What do you want a gun for?

23:50.580 --> 23:54.220
Now that I know how to shoot, I
should have one for protection.

23:56.850 --> 23:59.620
I'll give you the number, but ...

24:01.290 --> 24:04.050
why don't you let me pick it up for you.

24:04.060 --> 24:06.510
Okay. Thanks.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.350
Sure it's just for protection?

24:08.360 --> 24:12.810
Wes, do I look like a killer to you?

24:26.750 --> 24:28.990
Hello, michael.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.950
You remember jill?

24:32.980 --> 24:34.620
Of course.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.420
I'm just gonna get changed,
then we're heading to dinner.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.090
Take your time.

24:58.740 --> 25:01.740
- can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.

25:02.340 --> 25:06.260
I'm sorry to bother you. You know, michael
thought that, uh, that you'd still be at work.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.190
It's no bother at all.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.810
Jesus christ!

25:15.770 --> 25:17.610
All my shit is gone.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.940
You cleared out my entire room.

25:19.950 --> 25:22.810
- Yes.
- Why?

25:24.890 --> 25:30.360
You're not interested in college--
fine, but you don't live here anymore.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.710
You know what, um, why don't
I wait for you downstairs.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.740
No, no, stick around.

25:37.780 --> 25:41.510
You wanted
him-- he's yours.

25:42.580 --> 25:44.660
What did you do with all my stuff?

25:44.690 --> 25:47.100
I sent it to jill'S.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.470
Isn't that where you're
going to be living?

25:51.760 --> 25:55.940
You don't have any children. It'd be
nice to have a boy around the house.

25:55.950 --> 25:56.790
Ms. Hewes...

25:56.800 --> 26:02.580
Tell me the truth, jill, when
you look at him, do you see a man?

26:02.840 --> 26:04.480
Michael, let's go.

26:04.490 --> 26:08.210
Yes, go, michael.

26:08.880 --> 26:14.790
And when I want another man around the
house, I'll go out and find myself a real one.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.490
Come on.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.830
What's going on?

27:26.700 --> 27:29.680
I thought we took care of this bitch.

27:40.900 --> 27:44.240
Patty, come in here.

27:48.990 --> 27:51.330
Who invited them here?

27:51.750 --> 27:53.920
- You did.
- I want them to leave.

27:53.930 --> 27:59.300
They won't leave. People will always be
there, waiting to put a knife in your back.

27:59.650 --> 28:03.550
they hate you. everyone hates you.

28:04.180 --> 28:09.050
remember, patty... trust... no one.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.520
Ellen.

28:37.530 --> 28:39.900
Michael's gone.

28:39.910 --> 28:41.950
What happened?

28:41.980 --> 28:45.160
He refused to go to
college, so I kicked him out.

28:50.470 --> 28:53.070
What is it?

28:55.470 --> 28:59.950
Daniel purcell, phil, michael, tom...

29:01.950 --> 29:06.540
the only one that was
loyal to me was pete...

29:07.580 --> 29:09.880
and you.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.850
I haven't stuck by
you because of loyalty.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.940
No?

29:15.950 --> 29:18.480
I believe in what you do.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.390
Well, that's all I can ask for.

29:28.210 --> 29:33.490
This... thing with the judge...

29:36.170 --> 29:39.160
I wish we didn't have to do it.

29:41.510 --> 29:45.010
I didn't choose this case...

29:45.020 --> 29:47.010
but I can't just walk away from it.

29:47.050 --> 29:50.520
You're the only one who can help
those people in west virginia.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.860
I know it's risky.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.790
The feds are watching.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.520
Waiting for you to slip up.

30:01.770 --> 30:04.920
Are you sure you can trust judge oliver?

30:04.930 --> 30:08.250
I'm not sure I can trust anyone.

30:09.640 --> 30:14.820
Well, if we don't go through with it,

30:15.120 --> 30:20.610
unr, kendrick, pell,
all get off scot-free.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.770
I think we should do it.

30:27.310 --> 30:29.480
You do?

30:30.460 --> 30:32.660
Yes.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.580
Okay.

30:37.340 --> 30:40.240
Let's do it. Get a good night's sleep.

30:40.250 --> 30:43.670
This time tomorrow, it'll all be over.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.070
We can both move on.

30:53.930 --> 30:55.590
Good night, patty.

31:04.740 --> 31:06.280
We're on.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.320
What happened?

31:07.360 --> 31:09.370
Purcell and garrety won't testify.

31:09.410 --> 31:13.170
If she wants to win the case, she
has to go through with the bribe.

31:16.550 --> 31:18.600
Then this is it.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.810
As soon as I know, I'll
get you the time and place.

31:22.990 --> 31:25.420
Ellen...

31:26.780 --> 31:31.310
this is all because of
you. Congratulations.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.170
Why did you want to meet with me?

32:01.130 --> 32:04.170
I know you're manipulating
the energy market.

32:04.200 --> 32:08.350
You really think you can trust
finn garrety to keep his mouth shut?

32:08.970 --> 32:12.410
And I know you're
about to bribe a judge.

32:14.070 --> 32:17.520
Perhaps this meeting can
be mutually beneficial.

32:19.150 --> 32:23.640
You're behind this fbi
investigation, aren't you?

32:27.700 --> 32:33.420
I have an informant in my firm, don't I?

32:37.270 --> 32:39.740
Ellen parsons?

32:41.960 --> 32:46.300
Ms. Parsons has been working with
the feds for the past six months.

32:53.020 --> 32:55.530
How did they flip her?

32:56.320 --> 33:00.050
It was my understanding she
needed very little convincing.

33:05.890 --> 33:09.840
Patty, we can help each other here.

33:12.180 --> 33:14.640
What do you have in mind?

33:14.690 --> 33:17.990
I call off the feds for good,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.840
you forget everything you've
learned about the energy markets,

33:21.850 --> 33:24.570
the brownouts and the merger.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.530
I still want walter kendrick.

33:26.590 --> 33:29.940
If that's what it
takes, you can have him.

33:29.950 --> 33:34.040
I need evidence that unr
knew aracite was toxic.

33:34.050 --> 33:36.310
I can get you that.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.680
Do we have an agreement?

33:41.850 --> 33:44.220
One more thing.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.980
What's that?

33:47.030 --> 33:51.130
Ellen parsons is going
to bribe that judge.

33:51.790 --> 33:54.930
She's acting on her own.

33:56.870 --> 33:58.090
Understood.

33:58.110 --> 34:01.400
Talk to the people you
know. Destroy her file.

34:01.410 --> 34:04.430
Get the fbi to disown her.

34:05.930 --> 34:08.830
I want her arrested for it.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.639
We have a deal then?

34:15.480 --> 34:17.780
Yes.

34:24.380 --> 34:27.080
Mrs. Mckee. Hello.

34:27.760 --> 34:30.880
I was surprised to hear
from you. Is everything okay?

34:30.889 --> 34:35.489
I found something in peter's
closet. It has your name.

34:41.380 --> 34:45.310
<i>Make******</i>

34:47.170 --> 34:49.679
Yes, ma'am, yes,
ma'am, I'll take a look.

34:53.580 --> 34:55.909
Did he ever explain these to you?

34:56.330 --> 34:58.570
No.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.940
If pete did anything
bad, it was for patty.

35:06.780 --> 35:08.710
Why do you say that?

35:08.720 --> 35:13.230
Because everything he did was for patty.

35:14.910 --> 35:17.200
And now he's dead.

35:17.220 --> 35:20.000
I'm so sorry, mrs. Mckee.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.030
So, what's all this mean?

35:33.460 --> 35:36.260
It's evidence that
patty tried to kill me.

35:37.530 --> 35:40.360
It wouldn't mean anything to the
police, but if I showed it to patty,

35:40.380 --> 35:43.150
she wouldn't be able to deny it anymore.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.800
So, what are you going to do with it?

35:45.840 --> 35:48.890
I'm going to use it
to get her to confess.

35:57.850 --> 35:59.000
hello.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.900
Ms. Parsons, it's detective messer.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.950
Hello, detective.

36:03.990 --> 36:06.600
I have some new information for you.

36:06.610 --> 36:09.090
I'd like to discuss
it someplace private.

36:09.130 --> 36:12.650
Well, I'm busy today, but I could
probably find some time this afternoon.

36:12.930 --> 36:16.390
Good. I'll be expecting your call.

36:20.810 --> 36:22.680
Who was that?

36:22.690 --> 36:24.550
No one.

36:24.580 --> 36:27.180
Didn't sound like no one.
Who are you going to meet?

36:27.190 --> 36:30.830
Wes, I can't explain
everything to you. I'm sorry.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.670
You can't be around here today.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.540
Werner.

36:48.560 --> 36:50.350
It's dave pell.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.300
There's a change in plan.

36:52.310 --> 36:55.460
We're destroying all records
of of the hewes investigation.

36:55.470 --> 37:00.170
After the judge gets the
money, arrest ellen parsons.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.310
Copy that.

37:07.830 --> 37:09.110
Are you at the hotel?

37:09.130 --> 37:11.280
Yes. I've been waiting for your call.

37:11.290 --> 37:14.180
- I feel good about this, ellen.
- Me, too.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.120
Good. I'll see you in three hours.

37:23.550 --> 37:26.010
- So this is where the camera will be.
- Okay.

37:26.020 --> 37:28.780
We need her on tape
authorizing the bribe.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.850
No problem.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.750
- This investigation...
- What about it?

37:34.760 --> 37:37.070
I know it's corrupt.

37:38.730 --> 37:42.000
I don't care. We both
want the same thing.

37:42.380 --> 37:46.360
But if you want me to play
along, I need something from you.

37:46.370 --> 37:47.830
What's that?

37:47.860 --> 37:52.230
Whatever happens in this room
with patty, I need you to trust me.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.680
I'll get her to admit to
the bribe-- that's for you--

37:55.690 --> 37:59.500
but I'm gonna try and get
something else... for me.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.880
Yeah? What?

38:03.210 --> 38:06.160
I want her to admit
she tried to kill me.

38:06.510 --> 38:12.520
You do your job, and this bribe goes
through, ask her whatever the hell you want.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.730
I have to see patty.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.270
- You're not allowed in here.
- It's urgent.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.880
I have strict orders from ms. Hewes.

38:19.890 --> 38:22.500
Trust me, she's gonna want
to hear what I have to say.

38:22.530 --> 38:25.950
Sir, you're not allowed
in the building anymore.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.510
Let's do this the easy way.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.550
Oh, jesus.

38:32.390 --> 38:35.070
Well, tell patty that
I tried to warn her.

38:35.080 --> 38:39.610
And let her know that I'm filing suit
against her for wrongful termination!

38:41.960 --> 38:44.630
I called frank. I need
you to pick up the gun.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.240
- I'm not sure you should have one.
- What?

38:47.250 --> 38:49.670
I don't think you need it anymore.

38:50.010 --> 38:52.100
Wes, I need your help.

38:52.110 --> 38:54.980
I'm sorry, parsons, I can't do it.

39:02.650 --> 39:04.850
Tom, it's ellen.

39:04.860 --> 39:06.680
I have nothing more to say to you.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.890
Listen, I need your help.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.810
Why the hell would I help you?

39:11.820 --> 39:15.000
- Please, just hear me out.
- All right, you got 30 seconds.

39:15.010 --> 39:17.750
If you do what i ask, I can get
the feds off your back for good.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.710
Why should I trust you?

39:19.720 --> 39:22.780
Just do it, and I'll explain everything.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.610
Coming, baby.

39:38.730 --> 39:40.400
Where's you boyfriend, sweetheart?

39:40.410 --> 39:42.880
- I don't know who you're talking
about. - Finn garrety-- where is he?

39:42.890 --> 39:45.630
I don't know any finn garrety.

39:47.620 --> 39:50.020
Now...

39:50.350 --> 39:54.490
you see him again, you're
gonna deliver a message for me.

39:55.070 --> 39:57.530
- This is ellen parsons.
- You at the location?

39:57.540 --> 39:59.250
Yes, I'm here waiting.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.530
See you in 15 minutes.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.990
Shit.

40:39.540 --> 40:44.210
Here's what you wand on walter
kendrick, compliments of dave pell.

40:44.220 --> 40:47.410
The aracite documentation is on this?

40:47.420 --> 40:49.340
All of it.

40:54.170 --> 40:55.990
Okay, let's go.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.360
Who did this to you?

40:57.370 --> 40:59.420
He said his name was walter kendrick.

40:59.430 --> 41:01.530
Shit. Goddamn it!

41:01.540 --> 41:04.890
- He did this as a warning to you.
- Goddamn it!

41:06.280 --> 41:09.120
He said if you talk, he's
gonna have you killed.

41:09.130 --> 41:13.430
Shit. I'm gonna nail
that son of a bitch.

41:15.930 --> 41:20.870
Finn, don't leave me.

41:22.030 --> 41:24.430
Wes, I told you, you
can't be here today.

41:24.470 --> 41:27.180
I'm sorry, I just, um...

41:27.190 --> 41:29.660
What's wrong?

41:31.630 --> 41:33.480
I just had to see you.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.350
Are you okay?

41:35.980 --> 41:37.960
Yeah.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.230
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.780
Wes...

41:58.590 --> 42:01.370
Hello?

42:01.380 --> 42:04.400
Ten minutes?Okay.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.580
I gotta go.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.950
Do you always have to go?

42:09.990 --> 42:14.010
I told you there are things in
my life that i can't talk about.

42:14.370 --> 42:16.560
Who was that?

42:16.570 --> 42:19.320
- Leave it, wes.
- Seriously, who was that?

42:19.330 --> 42:22.310
Don't be here when I get back.

42:30.030 --> 42:31.630
Thanks, tom.

42:31.660 --> 42:34.220
I want the feds off my back.

42:35.570 --> 42:38.110
Hope you know what you're doing.

42:38.750 --> 42:40.740
I do.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.990
Is room 1909 available?

42:51.270 --> 42:54.270
That would be great.
Thank you very much.

43:01.330 --> 43:02.690
*****

43:02.730 --> 43:05.350
Patty hewes to see ellen parsons.

43:07.290 --> 43:08.210
Hello.

43:08.250 --> 43:10.690
Ms. Parsons, there's a
patty hewes here to see you.

43:10.700 --> 43:12.900
Send her up.

43:13.250 --> 43:15.580
Elevator's on the left.

43:38.630 --> 43:41.890
- Ms. Hewes.
- What are you doing here?

43:42.290 --> 43:45.280
- I followed you.
- Whatu o yowant?

43:45.290 --> 43:47.970
Walther kendrick came to see me.

43:47.990 --> 43:49.890
He threatened to kill me.

43:49.940 --> 43:54.200
You had your chance, mr. Garrety, and I was
very clear that you wouldn't have a second one.

43:54.210 --> 43:56.740
But I can help you. I can help you.

43:57.320 --> 43:58.720
We can help each other.

43:58.730 --> 44:00.950
I don't need your help.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.520
I am ready to testify.

44:03.560 --> 44:06.140
I've made my decision.

44:24.040 --> 44:27.110
- Everything okay?
- I'm fine.

44:28.430 --> 44:33.360
Come in. Have a seat.

44:39.850 --> 44:41.880
Is that the money?

44:41.890 --> 44:44.330
Yes.

44:46.350 --> 44:49.180
Before I go meet with the judge,

44:49.190 --> 44:54.980
you and I have some unfinished business
we need to discuss, don't you think?

45:00.040 --> 45:03.060
We don't have much time, ellen.

45:03.830 --> 45:06.640
You know what this is about, don't you?

45:09.550 --> 45:11.940
It's done.

45:13.660 --> 45:15.980
What do you mean?

45:15.990 --> 45:20.970
I want you to tell me something,
but I'd like a drink first.

45:39.510 --> 45:43.850
what's the matter? You
shouldn't be scared.

45:48.170 --> 45:50.810
Actually, ...

45:51.200 --> 45:53.670
I take that back.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.010
You should be scared.

46:00.070 --> 46:02.970
You should be terrified.

46:02.980 --> 46:07.690
It just would be so much
easier if you said the words...

46:09.090 --> 46:11.690
all I want you to do is tell the truth.

46:11.710 --> 46:16.200
But I know that can
be hard for you, so...

46:18.460 --> 46:21.420
I brought something that
i thought might help.

46:21.960 --> 46:26.710
And who knows? Maybe the
truth will set you free.

46:29.610 --> 46:34.640
Ellen, don'T. It's not who you are.

46:36.180 --> 46:41.300
You're right. You know me too
well. I would never use this.

46:42.090 --> 46:44.730
It's not even loaded.

46:46.710 --> 46:51.180
so it's just the two
of us, face-to-face.

46:52.130 --> 46:54.740
Just the two of us.

47:24.900 --> 47:28.210
<i>The******</i>

47:30.890 --> 47:34.090
It looks like you're not gonna
tell me the truth after all.

47:34.600 --> 47:37.300
You better not screw this shit up.

47:40.430 --> 47:42.550
Well, that's okay.

47:45.150 --> 47:47.620
I lied, too.

48:05.900 --> 48:08.270
surveillance camera.

48:10.540 --> 48:15.550
I'm an informant for the feds.
Don't know if you knew that.

48:16.700 --> 48:18.880
I didn'T.

48:19.230 --> 48:22.890
You know, working for
you this past year, I...

48:22.900 --> 48:25.940
think I understand you.

48:25.950 --> 48:30.580
You're corrupt, narcissistic, cruel...

48:31.330 --> 48:33.990
I can be.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.130
But so is the rest of the world.

48:38.290 --> 48:40.360
Yes.

48:40.380 --> 48:42.880
So I don't want you in jail.

48:43.630 --> 48:48.150
No more cameras, no
fbi, this is just for me.

48:53.220 --> 48:56.140
You know what I want to hear.

48:58.510 --> 49:01.900
During the frobisher case, you said that
fiske's suicide pushed you to a place

49:01.910 --> 49:04.570
that you'd never been before.

49:05.170 --> 49:08.670
It made you do things you never
thought you'd be capable of.

49:10.810 --> 49:16.450
The weekend I stayed at your
apartment, we both know what happened.

49:20.070 --> 49:23.900
I could put this gun to your
head and get you to say it...

49:24.870 --> 49:27.960
but I don't want it to be that way.

49:29.980 --> 49:34.430
I was... afraid.

49:34.760 --> 49:40.370
I didn't trust you. You knew things...

49:40.380 --> 49:43.520
so I...

49:44.310 --> 49:46.940
So you what?

49:47.340 --> 49:50.920
I told pete...

49:50.930 --> 49:53.950
You told pete what?

50:15.050 --> 50:18.580
I told pete...

50:19.060 --> 50:21.990
to have you killed.

50:36.120 --> 50:39.370
Thank you, patty.

50:58.270 --> 51:00.610
Go ahead.

51:05.970 --> 51:10.090
No. You're just going to
have to live with this.

51:15.010 --> 51:18.550
The feds are waiting for
you to bribe the judge, so...

51:22.970 --> 51:27.680
I guess we're gonna have to find
another way of winning the case.

51:28.850 --> 51:34.100
Just give the briefcase to the judge.

51:34.530 --> 51:37.590
If I do that, they'll arrest you.

51:38.990 --> 51:42.180
You have to trust me, ellen.

51:43.220 --> 51:45.780
*******

52:04.210 --> 52:06.390
Okay.

52:21.410 --> 52:23.670
Ellen, wait.

53:02.670 --> 53:04.700
- Please.
- I've made my decision.

53:06.010 --> 53:10.150
You had your chance, mr. Garrety, and I was
very clear that you wouldn't have a second one.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.810
I can help you. We can help each other.

53:12.820 --> 53:14.420
I don't need your help.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.190
I am ready to testify.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.340
I've made my decision.

53:20.320 --> 53:24.300
Yes... you have.

53:26.020 --> 53:29.600
And you're not sending
me to jail, bitch.

53:33.260 --> 53:36.410
bad decision.

53:42.700 --> 53:45.320
Oh, my god.

53:46.670 --> 53:48.970
Patty...

53:49.360 --> 53:52.610
there are things far worse than death.

53:54.380 --> 53:57.420
Like living with lies.

53:58.320 --> 54:01.200
You know what you've done.

54:02.320 --> 54:05.900
Now you have a chance
to set things right.

54:07.580 --> 54:09.630
Ray...

54:09.650 --> 54:13.230
There are things far worse than death.

54:14.930 --> 54:17.750
Don't worry about dying, patty.

54:18.800 --> 54:23.210
Face your fear. Face yourself.

54:28.190 --> 54:30.730
go to ellen.

54:30.740 --> 54:35.110
The truth is waiting
for you in that room.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.530
Everything okay?

55:20.400 --> 55:23.300
Oh, jesus christ!

55:25.620 --> 55:26.940
Dave pell.

55:27.220 --> 55:29.080
My informant just shot patty hewes.

55:29.090 --> 55:31.390
Just get to the courthouse
and make the arrest.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.110
If I leave her here, she's gonna die.

55:33.130 --> 55:35.240
That's not our problem.

55:52.990 --> 55:55.390
Oh, shit.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.920
*****

56:08.930 --> 56:11.230
Don't talk; save your energy.

56:24.400 --> 56:27.060
The gps codes will be
allowed into evidence.

56:27.070 --> 56:29.480
Thank you, your honor.

56:31.290 --> 56:35.290
Ellen parsons, you're under arrest.

56:35.650 --> 56:36.660
For what?

56:36.690 --> 56:38.410
Bribing an officer of the court.

56:38.460 --> 56:40.900
There must be some misunderstanding.

56:40.910 --> 56:42.160
Let's go.

56:42.180 --> 56:45.030
Did patty hewes get to you?
You working for her now?

56:52.230 --> 56:54.230
U.S.Marshal. Please step
away from the prisoner.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.260
She's in my custody.

56:56.270 --> 56:58.590
- And now you're in ours.
- Who are you?

56:58.600 --> 57:01.170
Cynthia shayes, U.S.Attorney's office.

57:01.180 --> 57:04.940
Sir, step away from the
prisoner. You're under arrest.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.100
What is going on?

57:13.140 --> 57:16.390
Ellen parsons is going
to bribe that judge.

57:16.410 --> 57:18.690
She's acting on her own.

57:18.720 --> 57:19.770
Understood.

57:19.790 --> 57:23.100
Talk to the people you
know. Destroy her file.

57:23.110 --> 57:26.210
Get the fbi to disown her.
I want her arrested for it.

57:26.220 --> 57:28.610
Done.

57:29.270 --> 57:32.210
Can you identify either of those voices?

57:34.510 --> 57:36.530
One of them is dave pell.

57:36.570 --> 57:39.100
How do you know mr. Pell?

57:43.000 --> 57:46.180
Agent werner, we know this
investigation is corrupt.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.250
Patty set this all up?

57:48.540 --> 57:50.270
Yep.

57:50.320 --> 57:53.630
When she figured out what was
going on, she hired me back.

57:53.640 --> 57:56.580
My sister knows everything.

57:56.590 --> 58:00.240
The U.S.Attorney's office is
going to need a statement from you.

58:00.250 --> 58:02.140
Of course.

58:02.170 --> 58:04.570
Dave pell's going to jail.

58:04.580 --> 58:07.410
U.S.Marshals. You're under arrest.

58:07.950 --> 58:10.710
You want to go with him?

58:12.550 --> 58:14.860
I want to cut a deal.

58:14.880 --> 58:19.130
Patty also... got this from dave pell.

58:19.750 --> 58:20.900
What is it?

58:20.930 --> 58:25.620
Evidence against walter kendrick
and ultima national resources.

58:25.640 --> 58:28.240
Put your hands behind your
back. You're under arrest.

58:28.250 --> 58:30.770
Bullshit! For what?

58:31.990 --> 58:34.830
Thanks, tom.

58:48.630 --> 58:52.230
<i>***</i>

59:05.260 --> 59:07.270
How you feeling?

59:09.460 --> 59:14.410
Doctor says putting the mind in neutral
will help speed up the healing process.

59:15.050 --> 59:19.340
Yeah, right. How is that going for you?

59:23.800 --> 59:26.740
the epa has begun the
cleanup in west virginia.

59:29.100 --> 59:31.050
Good.

59:31.060 --> 59:33.160
Still no word from ellen?

59:34.430 --> 59:36.470
No.

59:36.500 --> 59:39.420
Well, I called the hotel--
she checked out weeks ago.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.940
Her cell phone's disconnected, and...

59:41.970 --> 59:44.820
all my e-mails have bounced back.

59:56.240 --> 59:59.180
Things with patty didn't exactly...

59:59.190 --> 01:00:02.480
turn out the way I
thought they would, but...

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.710
I got what I needed from her. For now.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:15.040
What exactly did you say
to her in that hotel room?

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.180
It just feels so good to let it all go.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.230
I met someone else. I hope that's okay.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.690
I think I'll stay out here for a while.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.680
So let me know when she calls.

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.910
I don't think we're gonna see her again.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.580
I got a new job offer...

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:46.430
and I think I'm gonna take it.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:49.830
So I'll let you know how it goes.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.240
She'll be back. Trust me.
