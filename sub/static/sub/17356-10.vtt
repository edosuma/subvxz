00:07.508 --> 00:09.408
- ¶

00:09.410 --> 00:10.042
- Hey, Max.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.745
You ready for your big Z-Force
interview tomorrow?

00:12.747 --> 00:14.680
- Yup. That's why I'm
gettin' this haircut

00:14.682 --> 00:17.616
that says I care,
but not too much.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.719
- It also says
your barber has fleas.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.689
- Ha! Hank burn!

00:23.691 --> 00:25.491
- That's it. Shampoo girl!

00:25.493 --> 00:26.725
- CHLOE:
[whooshing]

00:26.727 --> 00:29.728
You heard the boss.
Beat it!

00:29.730 --> 00:31.463
- [whooshing]

00:31.465 --> 00:35.434
- Ahem!
So what about my tip?

00:35.436 --> 00:36.335
- Here's a tip--

00:36.337 --> 00:39.471
get paid before you
give the haircut.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.240
- Ach!

00:42.476 --> 00:45.144
- Hey, Max, nice sundress.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.111
- It's a barber's cape.

00:46.113 --> 00:49.815
- Well, whatever it is,
I'd love to borrow it sometime.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.352
- I'm gonna go try
on my new outfit.

00:54.221 --> 00:54.953
- What are you doing?

00:54.955 --> 00:56.588
You're supposed to be nerding
it up for our interview,

00:56.590 --> 00:58.223
not dumbing it
up with Cherry.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.758
- Don't worry, I've been
preppin' all week.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.393
Besides, Cherry really
needed help deciding

01:01.395 --> 01:03.228
what outfit to buy for
her ping pong tournament.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.131
- You are always dropping
everything to save Cherry.

01:06.133 --> 01:09.768
- That's not true.
- Phoebe, help!

01:11.238 --> 01:13.472
My outfit's trying
to eat me.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.406
- Oh.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.442
- Phoebe, we will not
make the finals

01:16.444 --> 01:18.610
if we don't ace
this interview.

01:18.612 --> 01:19.378
Remember the plan?

01:19.380 --> 01:23.749
You say smart things while
I wow them with my power pose.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.386
- You look like you're
holding in a fart.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.688
- It's my power pose!

01:31.392 --> 01:33.225
- This tournament
is gonna be awesome.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.761
And I can't lose with
my bestie by my side.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.629
- Cherry, I'm sorry.
I don't think I can come.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.498
I gotta be fresh
for my interview--

01:39.500 --> 01:41.867
especially if the guy
hates Max's power pose

01:41.869 --> 01:43.669
as much as I do.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.671
- But who will I high five,
if I win?

01:45.673 --> 01:47.272
Who will I cry on,
if I lose?

01:47.274 --> 01:49.575
Who will save me,
if I get stuck in the net?

01:49.577 --> 01:52.511
- Cherry!
Don't freak, okay?

01:52.513 --> 01:54.146
I'll be there for you.

01:54.148 --> 01:57.483
I just won't be
there for you.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.419
You're gonna do great.
- Yeah, you're right.

02:00.421 --> 02:05.124
And I don't need you to help
me with every little thing.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.825
I'll see ya.
- Okay.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.463
Pull, not push.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.567
- ¶

02:15.569 --> 02:19.471
- You're the most special-wecial
rose bush in the whole world.

02:19.473 --> 02:24.910
And you're gonna grow up to
be big boys, yes, you are!

02:24.912 --> 02:26.745
- Why is Mom talking
to her flowers?

02:26.747 --> 02:29.448
- It's not that weird.
I talk to trees.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.317
Hey, nice trunk, Herbie!

02:32.319 --> 02:36.321
- I'm leaving before
I catch crazy.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.289
[whooshing]

02:37.291 --> 02:40.359
- Your mother is using baby talk
to make her flowers grow

02:40.361 --> 02:42.594
so she can win
the Hiddenville Flower Fest.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.696
- Mrs. Wong may have
beaten me every year

02:44.698 --> 02:47.900
since we've moved here,
but this is my year.

02:47.902 --> 02:51.236
- Think again, bozo.

02:51.238 --> 02:55.807
Check it out.
My rose game is on fleek.

02:55.809 --> 02:56.608
[sniffs]
Ah...

02:56.610 --> 03:01.880
You will never know what
victory smells like, Barbara.

03:03.884 --> 03:04.683
- Ohhh!

03:04.685 --> 03:07.252
Just once I wish
I could beat her!

03:07.254 --> 03:09.388
- What you need
is some flower power.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.890
Remember that crazy
fertilizer back in Metroburg

03:11.892 --> 03:13.892
that makes
everything grow fast?

03:13.894 --> 03:14.593
- Whoa Grow?

03:14.595 --> 03:17.496
Hank, you always say
the Thundermans aren't cheaters.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.632
- I came up with that slogan
before I met Mrs. Wong.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.834
- No. I don't
have to cheat.

03:22.836 --> 03:26.738
I just need to get
my baby talk game on fleek.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.739
Don't I, boo-boos?

03:27.741 --> 03:30.342
- Hey. Let me
give it a try.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.377
Get your head in
the game, boo-boos!

03:32.379 --> 03:33.745
- Hank!

03:33.747 --> 03:35.747
This is why Max
quit football.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.482
- Well...

03:39.386 --> 03:40.686
- Billy, I have an idea.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.722
You run to Metroburg and get--
- BILLY: [zooming]

03:43.724 --> 03:44.890
I got the Whoa Grow.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.594
- That's the first time you've
had a clever idea before me.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.394
- It's obvious.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.431
You pour Whoa Grow on
the fence so it gets so big,

03:52.433 --> 03:55.267
Mrs. Wong can't
see over it.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.269
- That's better.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.671
Why don't we pour it on
Mom's roses instead?

03:59.673 --> 04:03.675
- Fine, if you think big
roses will do anything.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.647
- Just a little
more won't hurt.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.951
- ¶

04:12.953 --> 04:14.686
- There, perfect.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.756
I stop crime and wrinkles.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.425
- [cell phone dings]

04:20.427 --> 04:23.528
- Emergency text
from Cherry?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.931
You've gotta be kidding.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.834
You weren't kidding.
How did this even happen?

04:28.836 --> 04:32.404
- I pinged when
I should've ponged.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.007
- I'm sorry you lost.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.509
- No, I didn't lose.
I'm in the finals.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.745
This happened during
my victory dance.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.447
You wanna see it?
- No, no, no, no, no!

04:42.449 --> 04:47.519
- Okay, only one person stands
between me and the championship.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.857
- I'm gonna destroy you,
Cherry Seinfeld.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.458
- Don't listen to
Principal Bradford, okay?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.594
He's a pathetic middle-aged
man with nothing else to do

04:55.596 --> 04:58.897
but play in a stupid
ping pong tournament.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.599
No offense.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.467
- Hey, you girls gonna
gossip all night,

05:02.469 --> 05:05.337
or are we gonna
do this thing?

05:06.774 --> 05:10.709
- Oh, it would be so cool to
take a championship game selfie.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.012
- Sure. Go ahead
and take a picture.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.750
- Whoa!
- [heavy thud]

05:18.752 --> 05:19.885
- Phoebe!

05:19.887 --> 05:22.354
- I was never here!

05:22.356 --> 05:23.889
- Are you okay?

05:23.891 --> 05:26.925
- I really should've
stayed home.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.530
- ¶

05:31.532 --> 05:32.631
¶ What you see ¶

05:32.633 --> 05:33.832
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:33.834 --> 05:37.502
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:37.504 --> 05:38.970
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:38.972 --> 05:40.405
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:40.407 --> 05:41.940
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:41.942 --> 05:43.642
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

05:43.644 --> 05:45.510
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

05:45.512 --> 05:47.479
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

05:47.481 --> 05:48.780
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

05:48.782 --> 05:50.515
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

05:50.517 --> 05:52.384
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

05:52.386 --> 05:53.819
¶ It's our reality ¶

05:53.821 --> 05:54.920
¶ Just your average family ¶

05:54.922 --> 05:58.557
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

05:58.559 --> 06:02.794
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

06:06.600 --> 06:07.232
- Oh, sweet.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.000
You're ready for
our Z-Force interview

06:09.002 --> 06:11.169
like a good little nerd.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.306
[gasps]
My nerd is broken!

06:14.308 --> 06:15.640
- I'm sorry, Max.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.843
Cherry needed help at
her ping pong tournament,

06:17.845 --> 06:21.179
but I was the one
who got pinged...

06:21.181 --> 06:22.114
or ponged.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.249
It's a very
confusing sport.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.052
- We can't let the interviewer
see you like this.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.787
Z-Force members
don't get hurt--

06:28.789 --> 06:29.588
they do the hurting.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.857
- I know, I know, and
rescheduling isn't allowed.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.125
- You're supposed
to carry us.

06:33.127 --> 06:36.728
Now I have to carry you
because you can't walk.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.663
- And on the bright
side, Cherry won.

06:38.665 --> 06:39.731
- Ah, really?
Was it a close match?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.266
- Yeah, it actually
came down to--

06:41.268 --> 06:43.735
- I don't care!

06:43.737 --> 06:46.872
- Phoebe, how are
you feeling?

06:46.874 --> 06:47.439
- Oh, great.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.642
It's the girl who destroyed
our chances at the Z-Force.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.110
- Max, it's not her fault.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.645
- You're right, it's yours,

06:53.647 --> 06:55.147
because once again,
you had to go save Cherry.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.783
- Well, of course.
She always saves me.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.084
She's my super bestie.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.854
I just wish I could save her
from missing this interview.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.156
- Ow!

07:04.158 --> 07:05.924
- Not gonna happen,
unless you can replace her

07:05.926 --> 07:08.927
with someone who doesn't look
like they were hit by a bus.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.030
- Wait, Max, that's
a brilliant idea.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.199
If we can't fix me,
we can replace me

07:14.201 --> 07:18.069
with someone who knows
everything about me.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.772
- Where can we find
someone that can do that?

07:20.774 --> 07:24.843
Hey, I'm Phoebe Thunderman
and I have a twin brother.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.880
- There's no way anyone's
gonna believe Cherry's you.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.182
- Hey, Phoebe.

07:30.184 --> 07:32.284
- PHOEBE & CHERRY:
Told ya! Jinx!

07:32.286 --> 07:34.186
You owe me a soda!

07:34.188 --> 07:37.022
- Ugh, there's
two of them.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.960
- It's amazing how
well the Whoa Grow works.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.662
The roses are huge.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.331
- Let's get ready
for the flower show.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.067
- BOTH:
[screaming]

07:49.069 --> 07:51.036
Your hair's gray!

07:51.038 --> 07:53.905
- How did the years
go by so fast?

07:53.907 --> 07:58.210
- Wait, the Whoa Grow.
Maybe it did something to us.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.646
"Warning: Do not touch.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.248
May cause rapid aging."

08:03.250 --> 08:05.350
- BARB: Kids,
are you outside?

08:05.352 --> 08:07.419
- BOTH:
Oh, no!

08:08.822 --> 08:10.388
- There they are.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.958
- What's up with
your heads?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.927
- Um, we're wearing
these garden rally pots

08:15.929 --> 08:17.429
to help Mom win.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.698
- Yeah, aren't they gray?

08:19.700 --> 08:22.701
- Did you say gray?
- I heard "great".

08:22.703 --> 08:25.070
- Hank, look at my roses!

08:25.072 --> 08:27.973
- Are they behind these
really big roses?

08:27.975 --> 08:29.107
- No, these are mine!

08:29.109 --> 08:31.910
See, I told you--
baby-talking works.

08:31.912 --> 08:32.410
[gasps]

08:32.412 --> 08:35.013
Can't wait to see the look on
Wong's face when she loses!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.348
- Oh, let's get to
the garden show.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.116
Kids, wear those rally
pots for good luck.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.019
- Aren't they gray?
- Still heard "great"!

08:43.257 --> 08:46.258
- Okay, let's go over that
last question one more time.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.994
But first,
you look super pretty.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.328
- So do you.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.098
- I'm trapped in
my own nightmare.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.368
- Okay, so when he asks
you about your first save

08:56.370 --> 08:57.769
as Hiddenville's protector,

08:57.771 --> 09:01.273
you tell him you and Max saved
the water and power plant.

09:01.275 --> 09:04.743
- Pretty sure that
was you, Phoebe.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.012
- Oh, this was
a great idea.

09:07.014 --> 09:07.879
- [alarm beeping]

09:07.881 --> 09:09.848
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

09:09.850 --> 09:11.917
Z-Force interviewer
approaching.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.885
- Don't worry, I got this!

09:13.887 --> 09:17.022
It's my chance to finally
save you for once.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.424
- Ow, my neck!
- Sorry.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.193
- All right,
Phoebe, go hide.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.434
Hi! I'm Max Thunderman.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.171
- You look like
you're holding in a fart.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.173
You must be...

09:35.175 --> 09:36.408
Phoebe.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.509
- That's me, Pheeb to the B.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.745
Or Pheebs, or Queen Ph--
- MAX: [powers whooshing]

09:40.747 --> 09:43.014
- Just Phoebe is fine.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.785
- The name is Detail,
because I'm thorough.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.187
And I have a dog tail.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.456
No, you can't see it.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.924
- I didn't ask.

09:52.926 --> 09:53.925
- Everyone asks.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.993
And then they laugh.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.194
Then I fail them.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.863
And then I laugh.

09:58.865 --> 10:01.433
- So, are you
on the Z-Force?

10:01.435 --> 10:02.534
- I should be.

10:02.536 --> 10:03.935
I tried out 10 years ago,

10:03.937 --> 10:06.838
but my tail got stuck
in an escalator.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.442
It's how I got
the nickname "Tail Fail."

10:10.444 --> 10:13.278
You still can't see it,
so stop asking.

10:13.280 --> 10:18.550
Now, if the Z-Force passed over
a mighty man with a tail,

10:18.552 --> 10:22.053
what makes you think
you have what it takes?

10:22.055 --> 10:26.424
- Once you see our saves, I'm
sure you'll be really impressed.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.492
- DETAIL:
Doubt it.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.795
In this interview,
I wanna find out stuff

10:30.797 --> 10:34.432
no one else knows about you.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.500
- No one?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.435
Not even a best friend?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.805
- Oh, no.
- [quiet thud]

10:40.807 --> 10:42.974
- What was that?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.209
- [whistles]

10:44.211 --> 10:45.543
- [grunting]

10:45.545 --> 10:48.313
[heavy thud]

10:48.315 --> 10:50.215
Ow!

10:50.217 --> 10:53.018
- Do you mind?
I have a customer.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.855
That's the one I was
telling you about, Teddy.

10:56.857 --> 10:57.589
- What am I gonna do?

10:57.591 --> 11:00.525
There's no way Cherry's gonna
ace this interview without me.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.359
- Let me guess.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.828
You're gonna ask me to style
you to look like Cherry

11:03.830 --> 11:06.498
so you can crash
your own interview?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.001
- Howdy-do,
Thunderpeeps!

11:10.003 --> 11:13.338
It's Phoebe's
bestaroo, Cherry!

11:14.875 --> 11:18.143
- And the train
wreck continues.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.081
- ¶

11:23.083 --> 11:25.116
- Guys, I think
I might actually

11:25.118 --> 11:26.618
have a shot at
winning this year.

11:26.620 --> 11:31.322
- Mom's gonna kick
Wong's butt, baby!

11:31.324 --> 11:32.424
- Chloe...

11:32.426 --> 11:35.994
save it for when
Mrs. Wong's around to hear you.

11:38.598 --> 11:42.901
- Oh, no, I grew old
person nose hair.

11:42.903 --> 11:43.535
- Ew.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.137
It's like a gerbil
fell asleep in there.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.173
- That's it,
I'm running to Metroburg

11:48.175 --> 11:49.407
right now to find a cure.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.309
- Okay, but go after
we help Mom set up

11:51.311 --> 11:53.545
so she doesn't
get suspicious.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.312
- Cool.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.282
You have a nose
gerbil, too.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.950
- Okay, go now.

11:58.952 --> 12:03.221
- Ah, I always thought you
two had dirt for brains.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.557
Guess I was right.
[cackling]

12:05.559 --> 12:06.591
- For your information,

12:06.593 --> 12:09.327
my children are wearing
those pots to support me.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.464
- We sure are.
Woo-hoo! Go, Mom!

12:12.466 --> 12:14.265
Ow, my hip!

12:14.267 --> 12:18.603
- Your fan club is almost
as pathetic as your flowers.

12:18.605 --> 12:22.073
- Pathetic? Take a look.

12:22.075 --> 12:26.478
Barb's gonna kick
your butt, baby!

12:26.480 --> 12:29.447
- Hey, that's my thing!

12:29.449 --> 12:33.618
- I don't know what sorcery
you used on those flowers,

12:33.620 --> 12:36.020
but you'll never
beat me, Barbara!

12:36.022 --> 12:40.658
- Don't you listen to that mean
old Wong, my little boo-boos.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.161
- Oh, no, they're
growing too much.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.295
Your pot's cracking.

12:44.297 --> 12:49.134
- Luckily I have two super
fans with pots I can use.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.603
- Hands off,
whipper-snapper.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.438
- What? Why?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.507
- Because...Billy and I

12:55.509 --> 12:58.243
have inherited Dad's
sweaty head gene.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.980
- The doctor said it
would skip a generation.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.481
- Just hand over the pots.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.251
- Look, Mrs. Wong is
talking to your boo-boos.

13:06.253 --> 13:10.288
- Stop growing,
you dumb roses!

13:10.290 --> 13:14.392
What are you looking at,
you dumb people?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.261
- Where did Billy
and Nora go?

13:16.263 --> 13:20.532
- They're probably hiding so we
don't see their sweaty heads.

13:20.534 --> 13:23.401
Been there.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.271
- I don't think
they saw us.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.972
- BOTH:
[screaming]

13:27.974 --> 13:30.441
- [quivery voice]
Billy, we got even older.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.010
- [quivery voice]
I can't hear you.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.678
I think we got even older!

13:33.680 --> 13:37.649
I need to super speed to
Metroburg to find us a cure.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.556
- Your powers are old, too.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.090
What are we gonna do?

13:46.092 --> 13:48.593
- I don't know
what you're sayin'...

13:48.595 --> 13:51.062
but this feels right.

13:52.566 --> 13:55.300
- And saving her preschool class
from that snapping turtle

13:55.302 --> 13:59.504
got Pheebs named Metroburg's
supertoddler of the year.

13:59.506 --> 14:03.208
- Ah. Tell me again why
this non-supe is here.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.711
- I'm starting
to wonder why I'm here.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.147
- Okay, so, Phoebe,

14:09.149 --> 14:12.217
what was your first save
as Hiddenville's protector?

14:12.219 --> 14:14.118
- Uh, ah, Pheebs, weren't
you just saying that--

14:14.120 --> 14:16.321
- Z-z-zip it,
neck brace.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.057
I want to hear it from her.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.626
- Well, it was
when Max and I

14:21.628 --> 14:25.363
kept the water and power
plant from exploding.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.332
I actually did it!

14:27.334 --> 14:30.168
- We did it together.
Right, Phoebe?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.336
- CHERRY & PHOEBE:
Right.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.471
- [phone rings]
- Whoa!

14:33.473 --> 14:37.075
Metroburg's proton reactor
is having a meltdown.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.643
The Z-Force is busy!

14:38.645 --> 14:41.546
So they're calling me!

14:41.548 --> 14:44.048
This is my chance
to redeem myself.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.184
You two are coming with me.

14:46.186 --> 14:46.818
- ALL:
What?

14:46.820 --> 14:47.852
- Consider it part
of your interview.

14:47.854 --> 14:51.356
You have heat breath, freeze
breath, and telekinesis.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.459
I have...a tail.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.227
- For someone who's
so ashamed of his tail,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.363
you sure talk
about it a lot.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.132
- Ha ha!
There's our chopper!

15:01.134 --> 15:01.966
- [chopper blades whirring]

15:01.968 --> 15:04.369
- Let's go show
the Z-Force what I can do.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.470
- No, no, no, no, wait!

15:05.472 --> 15:07.639
Uh, I...I'm Phoebe's
good luck charm.

15:07.641 --> 15:08.506
You have to let me go.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.809
- I don't have to do anything--
especially show you my tail!

15:11.811 --> 15:14.646
Stop asking! Huh!

15:14.648 --> 15:17.482
- I never asked!

15:21.788 --> 15:28.726
- ¶

15:28.728 --> 15:30.728
- [alarm buzzing]

15:30.730 --> 15:34.332
- Okay, it looks like we're
approaching meltdown level two.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.201
- Oh, that's not so bad.
How many levels are there?

15:37.203 --> 15:37.869
- Two.

15:37.871 --> 15:41.406
One reactor's overheating,
the other is freezing.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.275
Stabilize them while I go
run around the building,

15:44.277 --> 15:45.843
taking credit for all of this.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.745
- Wait. What if we can't
stop the meltdown?

15:47.747 --> 15:50.782
- Then you'll be puddles
of radioactive goo.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.184
And I'll still
be Tail Fail.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.352
Don't let me down.

15:54.354 --> 15:59.457
Never fear!
Detail is here!

16:01.227 --> 16:01.826
- [door shuts]

16:01.828 --> 16:03.194
- All right, Max.
What can I do?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.229
- Get out of my way.
- Okay.

16:05.231 --> 16:09.367
- All I gotta do is use my
freeze breath on this core...

16:09.369 --> 16:11.235
[frosty breath gusting]

16:11.237 --> 16:12.370
- [ice crackling]

16:12.372 --> 16:14.639
- ...and use my heat
breath on this core.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.908
[fiery breath gusting]

16:16.910 --> 16:17.508
Ha.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.244
- [powering on]
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

16:20.246 --> 16:23.581
- Max, you really need to
work on your victory cheer.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.417
How about yippity-dippity?

16:26.419 --> 16:28.353
- No. That core just
heated up again.

16:28.355 --> 16:32.523
We have to freeze one and heat
the other at the same time--

16:32.525 --> 16:33.624
which means I won't
be able to

16:33.626 --> 16:35.626
stop this meltdown
without Phoebe.

16:35.628 --> 16:40.365
- Well, lucky for you,
I am Phoebe.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.601
Oh, you meant the real Phoebe?
Yeah, she's not coming.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.972
- Okay, Billy, if we can't
super speed to Metroburg

16:47.974 --> 16:52.944
to find a cure, then we need
to teleport there with Chloe.

16:52.946 --> 16:56.681
- Zoe? Who's Zoe?

16:56.683 --> 17:00.785
There's Chloe.
Maybe she knows Zoe.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.255
- Excuse me, pardon me.
Excuse me, pardon me.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.425
Excuse me, pardon me.
Chloe, I need your help.

17:07.427 --> 17:10.962
- What the heck
happened to you?

17:10.964 --> 17:11.662
- Long story.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.332
[quietly] I need you to
teleport me to Metroburg.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.566
Come on.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.335
- NORA:
[huffing]

17:17.337 --> 17:19.837
No-o-o-o!

17:19.839 --> 17:21.439
- Now what?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.307
Phoebe took Chloe away.

17:23.309 --> 17:27.045
- That was Phoebe?
I thought it was Max.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.049
- Excuse me, can you
please take a photo of us

17:31.051 --> 17:32.817
in front of my flowers?

17:32.819 --> 17:36.354
- Get off my lawn!

17:36.356 --> 17:37.755
- Is that you, Nora?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.724
- What did the big
fella say?

17:39.726 --> 17:40.992
- Billy?

17:40.994 --> 17:42.627
- How did this happen?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.996
- We were trying to
help Mom beat Mrs. Wong,

17:44.998 --> 17:48.833
so we used Whoa Grow.
Right, Billy?

17:48.835 --> 17:51.569
Oh, wake up,
you old bag of bones.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.906
- Huh? Where am I?

17:54.908 --> 17:58.076
- Oh, my poor
little babies!

17:58.078 --> 17:58.743
- Don't worry.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.412
We will change you back
right after Mom wins.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.882
- No, I don't want
to win like this.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.092
- Salt's the cure?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.627
Ain't that a kick
in the pants?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.629
- Yeah.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.597
- Barbara!

18:19.599 --> 18:21.866
I'm going to tell
the judges you cheated,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.501
because your flowers are...

18:23.503 --> 18:25.503
[gasps]
...tiny now!

18:25.505 --> 18:28.639
That means I'm definitely
going to win!

18:28.641 --> 18:31.776
- [gasps]
I won!

18:31.778 --> 18:34.946
Forget ping pong.
Gardening's ma jam.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.615
Tad Bradford's life
is not sad!

18:37.617 --> 18:41.519
- [pots shattering]
- [objects clattering]

18:41.521 --> 18:44.055
- I was never here!

18:44.057 --> 18:45.790
- Woo-hoo! Yeah!

18:45.792 --> 18:48.126
- Why are you cheering?
You didn't win.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.095
- Well, turns out I just
wanted to see you lose.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.097
And you did!

18:55.768 --> 18:59.670
- Can you change us back
before our teeth fall out?

18:59.672 --> 19:01.806
- Too late.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.641
- Oh, Hank,
let's turn 'em back

19:03.643 --> 19:06.444
before anything
else falls out.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.914
- [salt shaker shaking]

19:10.950 --> 19:12.416
- We're young again.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.452
- Yes, but you're
also grounded.

19:14.454 --> 19:18.990
- You can ground me, but you
can't make me give this up.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.994
Ah, this is so right!

19:25.098 --> 19:28.866
- [alarm buzzing]

19:32.539 --> 19:35.506
- [panting]
This is no use.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.975
We're gonna have to tell Detail
the truth and get outta here.

19:37.977 --> 19:43.714
Man, I hate to admit it, but
I really wish Phoebe was here.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.551
- Ow, ow, ow.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.119
- Phoebe, you're here!

19:48.121 --> 19:49.820
- Ow!

19:49.822 --> 19:53.591
- Well, I'm...not that
excited to see you.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.592
- Oh, really?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.861
- MAX ON RECORDING:
I really wish Phoebe was here.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.831
- Heard it, recorded it,
and made it my ringtone.

20:00.833 --> 20:01.532
- Let's do this.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.734
It'll be easy with
Detail out of the room.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.769
- DETAIL:
[laughing]

20:04.771 --> 20:09.473
And you can tell everyone
that Detail saved you!

20:09.475 --> 20:12.777
[gasps]
You guys aren't done yet?

20:12.779 --> 20:16.447
I just texted my mom
that I did it.

20:16.449 --> 20:20.451
- We're just regulating
some regulators.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.186
[quietly] We'll never
be able to pull this off

20:22.188 --> 20:23.120
with him watching.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.755
- Then I'll make sure
he's not watching.

20:24.757 --> 20:28.025
Hey, Mr. Tail, why don't you
let me get a picture of you

20:28.027 --> 20:31.696
stopping this whole meltdown
thing for the Z-Force?

20:31.698 --> 20:32.763
- Oh, good thinking.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.899
It would be proof
of my save.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.968
[laughing]

20:39.472 --> 20:41.505
Yeah? Uh-huh.
- [camera shutter clicking]

20:41.507 --> 20:44.041
- Stop! That's really
bright! Ow!

20:44.043 --> 20:44.942
- All right, quick.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.510
You blow freeze breath
on that core,

20:46.512 --> 20:47.511
and I'll heat
this one. Go!

20:47.513 --> 20:49.580
- [frosty breath gusting]
- [fiery breath gusting]

20:49.582 --> 20:51.782
- Work it.
Show me...hero.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.518
- [camera shutter clicking]
- I love it!

20:54.520 --> 20:58.055
- [fiery breath gusting]
- [frosty breath gusting]

20:59.125 --> 21:01.192
- Hey, we did it!
- Okay, hide!

21:01.194 --> 21:02.493
- Okay.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.529
- That's enough!
[grunts]

21:05.531 --> 21:09.567
[gasps]
Hold on! You did it?

21:09.569 --> 21:12.203
[laughing]

21:12.205 --> 21:13.004
Woo!

21:13.006 --> 21:15.072
Goodbye, Tail Fail!

21:15.074 --> 21:16.207
- So did we pass
the interview?

21:16.209 --> 21:19.076
- Yeah and you made me
look good doing it.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.512
Oh, I can't wait to
tell the Z-Force!

21:21.514 --> 21:23.180
I'm recommending
you for the finals.

21:23.182 --> 21:27.251
And as a reward, I'll give you
what you've been asking for.

21:27.253 --> 21:30.021
You can watch my tail wag.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.961
- Is it weird I want
a tail now?

21:38.264 --> 21:39.030
- I did it, Phoebe!

21:39.032 --> 21:42.900
All those times you've saved me,
and now I've finally saved you.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.902
- Of course,
you did, Cherry.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.672
You're my super bestie.

21:49.008 --> 21:49.974
- Thanks, Cherry.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.843
Our dream is still
alive because of you.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.946
You'll never hear
me say that again.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.315
- Please tell me
you got that.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.816
- MAX ON RECORDING:
Thanks, Cherry.

21:58.818 --> 22:02.153
Our dream is still
alive because of you.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.690
- Man, you are just full
of ringtones today.

22:10.897 --> 22:26.877
- ¶
