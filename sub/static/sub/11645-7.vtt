WEBVTT

00:04.048 --> 00:06.007
You keep looking until you find it.

00:06.118 --> 00:10.117
Who is she? She was my girlfriend.
She died.

00:11.918 --> 00:13.837
I thought we could go away together.

00:13.838 --> 00:15.117
Like a holiday?

00:15.118 --> 00:17.597
I was thinking Morocco, somewhere
like that.

00:17.598 --> 00:18.797
What, you found it?

00:18.798 --> 00:21.117
I thought you'd be a little more
excited.

00:21.118 --> 00:22.837
It's complicated.

00:22.838 --> 00:25.757
If the probation worker goes missing
and we don't turn up to community
service,

00:25.758 --> 00:26.957
it looks suspicious.

00:26.958 --> 00:29.557
Something's going on with my power.

00:29.558 --> 00:30.757
I can't switch back.

00:30.758 --> 00:31.837
I'm stuck!

00:31.838 --> 00:34.517
I can help you, but I need you to do
something for me.

00:34.518 --> 00:36.637
I'll do it. I've got another power,

00:36.638 --> 00:39.837
and you'll have to use it for me.
The power to bring people back from
the dead.

00:39.838 --> 00:40.957
Like who?

00:40.958 --> 00:44.957
My dead girlfriend.

00:52.598 --> 00:56.317
What's she going to be like?

00:56.318 --> 00:58.677
Jesus, what's she going to say?

00:58.678 --> 01:00.677
She's going to freak out.

01:00.678 --> 01:03.957
What do I say to her?

01:03.958 --> 01:06.437
Well, have you got any advice?

01:06.438 --> 01:10.317
I guess you play it cool.

01:10.318 --> 01:14.317
Play it down, like...

01:14.758 --> 01:17.517
hi.

01:17.518 --> 01:18.637
Hi?!

01:18.638 --> 01:20.517
Well, I don't know.

01:20.518 --> 01:24.517
I've been mixed up with some
seriously weird shit, but this...

01:26.198 --> 01:30.197
this is definitely out there.

01:33.758 --> 01:37.757
You don't tell Kelly I was involved.

01:40.718 --> 01:44.717
Let's go resurrect my dead
girlfriend.

Are you sure you want to do this?

02:34.798 --> 02:38.797
Do it.

03:36.318 --> 03:40.317
What the fuck is going on?

03:40.326 --> 03:41.680
Hi.

05:15.052 --> 05:17.891
Are you OK?

05:17.892 --> 05:21.891
Shannon?

05:22.092 --> 05:24.531
Sorry.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.011
I made your favourite - lasagne.

05:28.012 --> 05:32.011
Well, I say I made it... I bought it
and stuck it in the oven.

05:33.932 --> 05:36.691
So...

05:36.692 --> 05:40.371
how've you been?

05:40.372 --> 05:43.171
After you died...

05:43.172 --> 05:46.971
the funeral and everything...

05:46.972 --> 05:50.731
I was a mess.

05:50.732 --> 05:53.731
I should've never have let you have
the gear.

05:53.732 --> 05:55.291
I could've stopped you.

05:55.292 --> 05:57.931
You didn't force me to take it.

05:57.932 --> 06:01.931
Yeah, well, I'm going to make it
right.

06:03.052 --> 06:07.051
We've got a second chance.

06:11.012 --> 06:15.011
Are you OK?

06:15.652 --> 06:17.691
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

06:17.692 --> 06:21.691
What about dinner?

06:21.692 --> 06:25.451
I'm not hungry.

06:25.452 --> 06:29.451
I'm sorry.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.971
It'll be OK.

06:32.972 --> 06:36.971
I promise.

07:04.812 --> 07:06.691
Are you all right?

07:06.692 --> 07:07.971
He's dead.

07:07.972 --> 07:11.971
Mr Miggles. A car hit him.

07:11.972 --> 07:14.051
He's dead.

07:14.052 --> 07:15.771
Do...

07:15.772 --> 07:18.851
Do you want me to take a look at
him? What are you going to do?

07:18.852 --> 07:21.571
I'm a vet.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.491
You don't look like a vet.

07:23.492 --> 07:25.331
You don't think black people can be
vets?

07:25.332 --> 07:29.331
No, no, no, no.

07:36.572 --> 07:38.731
What are you doing to him? Well...

07:38.732 --> 07:41.011
Well, CPR, innit?

07:41.012 --> 07:43.931
You never watch those hospital shows
on TV?

07:43.932 --> 07:47.931
Well, back up! Give me some space.

08:02.372 --> 08:04.531
Mr Miggles!

08:04.532 --> 08:08.051
Mr Miggles! Thank you.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.371
I want to kiss you!

08:09.372 --> 08:11.411
Oh, no, no, you're all right.

08:11.412 --> 08:14.651
Would you like a cup of tea? No. I
have to go.

08:14.652 --> 08:17.611
What about cake? I've got a Victoria
sponge. Please!

08:17.612 --> 08:21.611
All right. I'll take the cake.

08:23.812 --> 08:26.651
You will promise to bring
my cake tin back, won't you?

08:26.652 --> 08:30.651
Yeah, yeah. I'll bring your cake tin
back.

08:54.132 --> 08:56.011
Is this turning you on?

08:56.012 --> 08:58.291
No.

08:58.292 --> 09:01.091
You should get her one of those
costumes, mate.

09:01.092 --> 09:05.091
One of those short little skirts.
I'm not dressing as a cheerleader.

09:08.212 --> 09:10.571
All right, maybe I'll do it for your
birthday.

09:10.572 --> 09:13.331
Cheerleaders?

09:13.332 --> 09:15.251
Sweet!

09:19.292 --> 09:22.371
What's that? Victoria sponge.

09:22.372 --> 09:24.451
Why have you got a Victoria sponge?

09:24.452 --> 09:26.971
I baked it.

09:26.972 --> 09:28.811
You baked a cake?

09:28.812 --> 09:32.131
What, you didn't know that about me?

09:32.132 --> 09:35.731
I love to bake.

09:35.732 --> 09:37.531
Fucking voicemail.

09:37.532 --> 09:41.531
It's me. I've left four messages.
What's going on? Where are you?

09:42.812 --> 09:44.811
Just give me a call, yeah?

09:44.812 --> 09:46.931
Morning, my lovelies.

09:51.332 --> 09:53.331
Jesus!

09:56.092 --> 10:00.091
Fucking cheerleaders!

10:08.652 --> 10:10.931
How are you feeling?

10:10.932 --> 10:14.691
I'm... sorry...

10:14.692 --> 10:17.131
I was so weird last night.

10:17.132 --> 10:19.491
You were brought back from the dead.

10:19.492 --> 10:23.491
You're entitled to be a little bit
freaked out.

10:25.892 --> 10:29.411
It hasn't changed.

10:29.412 --> 10:33.411
I still feel the same way about you.

11:01.332 --> 11:04.771
Are you OK?

11:04.772 --> 11:08.771
Yeah.

11:08.852 --> 11:12.851
I won't be long.

11:35.012 --> 11:39.011
Hello?

11:41.172 --> 11:45.171
Hello?

11:48.572 --> 11:52.571
Are you OK?

12:16.212 --> 12:21.411
You're not going to believe this!

12:28.932 --> 12:32.931
Is there something up with your
phone? I've left loads of messages.

12:33.972 --> 12:35.771
I can't see you any more.

12:35.772 --> 12:37.291
What?!

12:37.292 --> 12:40.491
I'm sorry.
You're dumping me?

12:40.492 --> 12:43.011
I have to. It was a mistake...

12:43.012 --> 12:46.451
I'm a mistake? Fuck you, you prick!

12:46.452 --> 12:48.211
No. I didn't mean it like that.

12:48.212 --> 12:51.731
Kelly, I really like you.

12:51.732 --> 12:55.731
So, why are you dumping me?

12:56.172 --> 12:59.211
I found someone with the power to
bring dead people back to life.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.451
What are you talking about?

13:01.452 --> 13:04.411
I brought her back.

13:04.412 --> 13:06.531
Shannon's alive.

13:06.532 --> 13:10.051
I had to. It was my fault she died.

13:10.052 --> 13:12.611
How could you do that to me?

13:12.612 --> 13:13.411
I'm sorry.

13:13.412 --> 13:15.011
Yeah, well, you did it.

13:15.012 --> 13:19.011
And you can fuck off
back to your dead girlfriend.

13:20.492 --> 13:22.171
Just fuck off! Go!

13:22.172 --> 13:26.171
Fuck off.

13:39.332 --> 13:42.571
What's all this about a cat?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.411
Curtis says
he's trapped in the bathroom.

13:44.412 --> 13:48.411
There's a crazy killer cat in there.

13:56.652 --> 14:00.331
Oh, now, come on now. Nobody told me
we were getting tooled up.

14:00.332 --> 14:04.331
Can we just go and kill
this fucking cat?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.811
"Crazy killer cat" -
it sounds like the sort of shit

14:08.812 --> 14:11.691
you'd use to lure someone
into a surprise birthday party.

14:11.692 --> 14:15.691
He's probably waiting in there
with a load of his mates,

14:15.892 --> 14:19.051
some party poppers.

14:19.052 --> 14:21.131
Maybe not.

14:21.132 --> 14:22.851
Curtis!

14:28.892 --> 14:30.371
What happened?

14:30.372 --> 14:34.371
It was her cat. It was...
it was eating her face.

14:35.372 --> 14:39.371
Well, it came after me.
It's gone psycho!

14:40.012 --> 14:44.011
It's in here somewhere.

14:49.732 --> 14:51.251
Mr Miggles?

14:51.252 --> 14:52.811
Here, kitty, kitty.

14:52.812 --> 14:56.811
He's under the sofa!

14:57.892 --> 15:01.891
The blanket. That blanket.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.491
Now what are we gonna do with it?!

15:22.492 --> 15:26.491
We kill it.

15:39.812 --> 15:41.651
- I can't do it.
- Aw.

15:41.652 --> 15:43.051
Why should I do it?

15:43.052 --> 15:44.891
I'm not doing it!

15:44.892 --> 15:47.051
No way! It's bad luck to kill a cat.

15:47.052 --> 15:48.771
Now, come on.

15:48.772 --> 15:52.091
You can kill numerous probation
workers... you can't kill one cat?

15:52.092 --> 15:55.531
Probation workers don't count.
Well, then, it's your lucky day,

15:55.532 --> 15:57.571
because I hate cats.

15:57.572 --> 16:01.571
All that fucking miaowing.
Here you are, man. Right.

16:10.852 --> 16:14.291
No, no, no, no.
I can't kill a cat, man.

16:14.292 --> 16:16.891
It's just...
It's out of order, innit?

16:16.892 --> 16:20.891
Oh!

16:21.572 --> 16:23.011
What are you doing?

16:23.012 --> 16:26.451
We thought Mr Miggles killed you!

16:26.452 --> 16:28.651
He attacked me.
Yes, he has!

16:28.652 --> 16:32.651
He's eaten a bit of your face there.

16:37.092 --> 16:38.531
Cornetto?

16:38.532 --> 16:42.531
No?

16:47.172 --> 16:51.171
Oh, ooh! Get her off me, man!

16:54.052 --> 16:56.451
Oh, Lord God!

16:57.692 --> 16:59.331
Oh, mate!

16:59.332 --> 17:02.771
Oh!

17:02.772 --> 17:06.330
Urgh!

17:06.332 --> 17:08.611
What the fuck is going on?!

17:08.612 --> 17:12.531
Mr Miggles got hit by a car.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.330
I brought him back to life.

17:14.332 --> 17:17.290
It was you?

17:17.291 --> 17:19.371
You brought Shannon back, didn't you?

17:19.372 --> 17:22.050
It was the only way
to get rid of my old power.

17:22.051 --> 17:24.330
Otherwise I would've been a girl
forever!

17:24.332 --> 17:27.810
I got dumped because of you.
Thanks a lot, mate.

17:27.811 --> 17:30.091
It's like a zombie film.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.451
Never watched one, mate.
I'm more of an ET man, me.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.131
I fucking love that little cunt...

17:34.132 --> 17:36.531
How do you mean,
it's like a zombie film?

17:36.532 --> 17:39.331
Anyone who was brought back to life,
it's like they need to feed.

17:39.332 --> 17:41.171
It's infectious.

17:41.172 --> 17:43.091
If you get bitten,
you become one of them.

17:43.092 --> 17:44.851
Hang on a minute.

17:44.852 --> 17:47.531
He brought Shannon back from the
dead. Are you saying she's a zombie?

17:47.532 --> 17:48.971
Who's Shannon?

17:48.972 --> 17:51.331
Wait, Kelly!

17:53.492 --> 17:57.491
What are we gonna do
with this frigging cat?

18:21.132 --> 18:24.291
You OK?

18:24.292 --> 18:28.291
Just tired.

18:29.772 --> 18:33.251
Have you seen Iggy?

18:33.252 --> 18:35.211
Shit.

18:35.212 --> 18:39.211
Must've got out.

19:01.292 --> 19:03.571
Where is she?
Kelly, don't do this.

19:03.572 --> 19:04.891
She's a fucking zombie!

19:04.892 --> 19:06.491
What?! What are you talking about?

19:06.492 --> 19:09.291
When you bring people back from the
dead, they turn into a zombie.

19:09.292 --> 19:11.611
We just had to kill some old woman -
a cat ate her face.

19:11.612 --> 19:14.131
Curtis brought her cat back from the
dead. It went zombie.

19:14.132 --> 19:17.171
Who's she?

19:17.172 --> 19:19.651
I was his girlfriend
until he dug you up.

19:19.652 --> 19:23.051
Look, it's not like you think.
What's she talking about?

19:23.052 --> 19:25.291
It's nothing.
You're a zombie!

19:25.292 --> 19:26.971
I'm a what?!

19:26.972 --> 19:29.451
You have to kill her
before she bites you.

19:29.452 --> 19:31.851
Right, get out.
You've got to kill her!

19:31.852 --> 19:33.771
She's gonna bite...
She's a fucking zombie!

19:33.772 --> 19:37.771
You stay away from her!

19:38.692 --> 19:41.451
She's a zombie
and she's going to kill you, Seth!

19:41.452 --> 19:44.491
Open the fucking door!

19:44.492 --> 19:48.491
Grrr!

19:54.612 --> 19:58.611
We only got together when I thought
I couldn't bring you back.

19:59.292 --> 20:01.291
Just stay away from me.

20:01.292 --> 20:05.291
Shannon!

20:33.292 --> 20:33.811
Ahh.

20:33.812 --> 20:36.011
Ahh.

20:36.012 --> 20:38.531
Whoa! Easy, tiger!

20:38.532 --> 20:42.531
For crying out loud.

20:45.932 --> 20:48.211
Have you got any change
for the vending machine?

20:48.212 --> 20:50.571
Just... fuck off!

20:50.572 --> 20:52.411
No, no, no, no, no, don't touch me!

20:52.412 --> 20:54.491
Don't touch me! Fuck off!

20:54.492 --> 20:58.491
Fucking fuckers.

21:20.052 --> 21:21.251
Are you OK?

21:24.572 --> 21:26.611
I was 13.

21:26.612 --> 21:29.651
I'd just come in from school, so...

21:29.652 --> 21:33.291
I poured myself a nice, cold,
nourishing glass of milk.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.691
Head into the lounge
to watch Blue Peter,

21:36.692 --> 21:40.131
good, wholesome family
entertainment.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.371
I open the door...

21:43.372 --> 21:46.131
and I see my dad.
And he is just...

21:46.132 --> 21:49.291
he's just fucking the hell
out of my mum.

21:49.292 --> 21:52.051
Faces all, like, contorted,
like that.

21:52.052 --> 21:55.451
Like a wild animal.

21:55.452 --> 21:57.971
She was dressed like a cheerleader.

21:57.972 --> 22:01.531
Little skirt...

22:01.532 --> 22:05.531
pompoms, everything.

22:06.052 --> 22:07.131
Is that it?

22:07.132 --> 22:10.931
Whoa! That image haunted me
all the way through puberty.

22:10.932 --> 22:12.971
I can't even sit down
and have a relaxing wank

22:12.972 --> 22:14.531
without it popping into my head.

22:14.532 --> 22:18.371
Every time I shut my eyes.
It scarred me. It scarred me.

22:18.372 --> 22:22.371
You know some people are scared of
clowns? For me, it's cheerleaders.

22:24.532 --> 22:26.611
No-one's scared of clowns.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.011
It's called coulrophobia.

22:28.012 --> 22:31.491
Yeah, well, so, imagine your dad
is dressed as a clown

22:31.492 --> 22:35.491
and he's... fucking your mum,
like that.

22:37.212 --> 22:39.011
Why would my dad be
dressed as a clown?

22:39.012 --> 22:40.691
Well, I don't know
what he gets up to

22:40.692 --> 22:44.691
in the privacy of his own home,
sick pervert, do I?

22:45.252 --> 22:47.091
Fucking cheerleaders, man.

22:47.092 --> 22:51.091
Fuck.

22:57.092 --> 22:59.251
It's the only way
he'd take my power.

22:59.252 --> 23:03.251
I couldn't have a baby.
How the fuck's that gonna work?

23:06.612 --> 23:10.611
I'm sorry, yeah?

23:15.972 --> 23:18.331
So, what happened
when you went down there?

23:18.332 --> 23:19.531
He didn't believe me.

23:19.532 --> 23:23.531
He's just acting like
nothing's wrong.

23:23.612 --> 23:25.491
What are you gonna do?

23:25.492 --> 23:27.211
I should let her eat the prick.

23:27.212 --> 23:30.771
He thinks I'm saying it
cos I'm jealous.
It's him I'm pissed off with.

23:30.772 --> 23:34.771
I'm not some nasty, jealous
little skank. I hate that.

23:36.092 --> 23:40.091
I'm gonna have to fucking kill her,
aren't I?

23:40.532 --> 23:44.531
Do you want a hand with that?

24:06.132 --> 24:07.731
Hi. I, er...

24:07.732 --> 24:11.731
I live next door. I was just
dropping this back for Seth.

24:13.332 --> 24:14.771
Er...

24:14.772 --> 24:18.771
Seth's in the kitchen. Come in.

24:35.267 --> 24:39.600
What are you doing?
Get off me! Argh!

24:56.612 --> 24:59.571
What did you do to me?

24:59.572 --> 25:02.531
I'm sorry.

25:02.532 --> 25:05.971
I couldn't help myself.

25:05.972 --> 25:09.971
Oh, fuck!

25:10.972 --> 25:14.211
You bit me?!

25:14.212 --> 25:18.211
Oh, you crazy bitch!

25:28.412 --> 25:30.491
What are you doing?!

25:30.492 --> 25:34.491
Well, it beats a fucking
Cornetto, doesn't it?

25:44.732 --> 25:48.731
Shannon!

25:50.852 --> 25:54.851
We have to go.

26:02.532 --> 26:06.531
What's going on? It's Kelly and her
mates. They're coming for you.

26:12.532 --> 26:14.931
No! Don't. You can't.

26:14.932 --> 26:18.931
Shannon, they think you're a
zombie. They're coming to kill you.

26:19.452 --> 26:23.451
We need to hide in your flat.

26:44.252 --> 26:45.691
What?!

26:45.692 --> 26:49.411
You try carrying it up all them...
I can't feel my arms!

26:49.412 --> 26:53.411
Eh?

27:06.532 --> 27:10.531
What's going on? Shh.

27:19.532 --> 27:21.251
Smash it down.

27:21.252 --> 27:25.251
A-ha! Now, who's the big man with the
bloody great hammer? Eh? Is it you?

27:32.092 --> 27:36.091
Shouldn't be a... Shouldn't be a
problem. So...

27:40.452 --> 27:44.331
Jesus!

27:44.332 --> 27:45.811
Miss.

27:45.812 --> 27:49.811
One more. Hmm?

27:55.852 --> 27:59.331
What the fuck is going on out there?
Some people are after Shannon.

28:13.492 --> 28:15.451
Oh!

28:15.452 --> 28:18.891
Hang on, guys.

28:18.892 --> 28:20.331
Oh, man.Give me a minute!

28:20.332 --> 28:22.971
Fuck's sake.

28:22.972 --> 28:26.971
Oi, it's harder than it looks.
It's hard, man, it's really hard.

28:44.492 --> 28:48.491
We could try his office.

28:49.852 --> 28:53.771
So, now I have to carry it back
down to the car. How is that fair?

28:53.772 --> 28:57.771
I carried it up here!

29:05.212 --> 29:07.451
Sorry, man, there was nowhere else to
go.

29:07.452 --> 29:11.451
I owe you one.

29:16.172 --> 29:20.171
Argh!

29:30.172 --> 29:31.851
It's like a hunger.

29:31.852 --> 29:33.611
Ever since you brought me back.

29:33.612 --> 29:37.491
I've tried to fight it. At the
start, I could control it, but...

29:37.492 --> 29:39.531
it's too strong.

29:39.532 --> 29:42.531
I need to feed.

29:42.532 --> 29:43.731
Iggy!

29:43.732 --> 29:45.731
I had to.

29:45.732 --> 29:49.731
It was the only way that I could
stop myself from feeding on you.

29:50.252 --> 29:53.331
This is my fault. I did this to you.

29:53.332 --> 29:56.571
You didn't know.

29:56.572 --> 30:00.171
Right, I'll find someone
with the power to fix this.

30:00.172 --> 30:01.811
There's powers for everything.

30:01.812 --> 30:04.011
And, until then, what do we do?

30:04.012 --> 30:08.011
If I don't feed, I won't be able to
stop myself.

30:08.252 --> 30:12.251
I'll kill you.

31:47.612 --> 31:49.531
I'll go to a pet shop.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.331
What are you going to get me?

31:51.332 --> 31:52.771
What do you mean?

31:52.772 --> 31:54.891
What are you going to get me to feed
on?

31:54.892 --> 31:58.051
Dunno. What do you want?

31:58.052 --> 31:59.731
Gerbil?

31:59.732 --> 32:01.811
Puppy might be better.

32:01.812 --> 32:05.811
It's bigger.

32:15.052 --> 32:16.451
Don't go out.

32:16.452 --> 32:20.451
I won't be long.

32:28.652 --> 32:31.051
He wants blood.

32:31.052 --> 32:35.051
Let's get him a mouse and let him
chow down on that little fucker.

32:35.292 --> 32:38.651
And then we'd have a zombie mouse
as well.

32:38.652 --> 32:42.651
This is just getting like
a zombie Noah's ark!

32:42.812 --> 32:45.611
Right, let's pull straws.

32:45.612 --> 32:49.611
And someone is going to kill this
cat, cos I am sick of carrying it
around now.

33:17.092 --> 33:21.091
Will you just pick one?! All right.

33:22.612 --> 33:24.451
Come on...

33:24.452 --> 33:26.211
Get in!

33:26.212 --> 33:30.211
Fuck you, you fucking loser!

33:33.972 --> 33:35.851
It's not about the winning.

33:35.852 --> 33:37.731
Is it?

33:37.732 --> 33:40.731
It's about the taking part. Go on,
kill the cat.

33:40.732 --> 33:44.731
Go on.

33:58.332 --> 33:59.771
Is Kelly here?

33:59.772 --> 34:02.771
Not yet.

34:02.772 --> 34:06.771
You know, I think this new power you
gave me has some pretty serious side
effects.

34:09.092 --> 34:13.091
How's it going with Shannon?

34:13.931 --> 34:15.650
So, it turns out...

34:15.652 --> 34:18.891
she's a zombie.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.091
She's killed my neighbour, my pet
iguana.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.531
She's killed your iguana?

34:22.532 --> 34:23.971
Drained him dry.

34:23.972 --> 34:27.251
Shit!

34:27.252 --> 34:31.251
I need to ask you a favour.

34:32.371 --> 34:36.051
I need you to kill Shannon.

34:36.052 --> 34:40.051
I can't do it. I can't kill her.

34:51.851 --> 34:54.531
Mr Miggles escaped from his cage.
Shit!

34:54.532 --> 34:57.371
You keep someone in a cage?
It's a cat.

34:57.372 --> 35:01.371
A zombie cat.

35:22.372 --> 35:25.051
We can't let Mr Miggles get out of
the community centre.

35:25.052 --> 35:28.491
Right, well, put yourself in his paws
and find out where he is, yeah?

35:30.492 --> 35:34.491
I think we can probably guess where
he is.

36:04.892 --> 36:06.211
What's happening?

36:06.212 --> 36:10.211
Well, let's just say it's not good.
It's not.

36:13.732 --> 36:17.531
Oh, my God!

36:17.532 --> 36:21.531
Oh, come on. Give up! Oh, come on,
it's over!

36:22.292 --> 36:26.291
It's over, it's over.

36:29.372 --> 36:32.051
Urgh!

36:32.052 --> 36:35.851
Fucking cheerleaders.

36:35.852 --> 36:38.731
Morning!

36:38.732 --> 36:40.091
What the fuck is going on?!

36:40.092 --> 36:42.611
Mr Miggles got loose.

36:42.612 --> 36:46.611
Might've infected... one or two
cheerleaders.

36:46.892 --> 36:49.851
He infected all of them. All of 'em.

36:49.852 --> 36:52.531
What are you doing here?

36:52.532 --> 36:55.251
What you said about Shannon... I know
it's true.

36:55.252 --> 36:59.251
Well, you should've fucking listened
to me, then, shouldn't you?

36:59.412 --> 37:03.211
So, what are we going to do about
the rest of them?

37:03.212 --> 37:05.811
We kill them all.

37:05.812 --> 37:09.331
We smash their skulls to destroy
their brains.

37:09.332 --> 37:12.051
That's a lot of killing... even for
us.

37:12.052 --> 37:14.851
If we don't, the infection will
spread.

37:14.852 --> 37:18.851
We'll end up the sole survivors,
locked in a shopping centre.

37:20.452 --> 37:21.931
That's what happens.

37:21.932 --> 37:25.931
There's no middle ground? We can't
just keep a low profile, let it all
blow over?

37:27.252 --> 37:28.291
Oh.

37:28.292 --> 37:30.491
Oh, for fuck's sake!

37:34.332 --> 37:38.331
Don't let any of them go!

37:44.932 --> 37:47.491
I'm just going to go and help...

37:47.492 --> 37:49.611
batter some cheerleaders.

37:49.612 --> 37:53.611
Happy days.

37:55.212 --> 37:59.211
Sorry.

38:12.932 --> 38:16.931
They bit me.

38:16.932 --> 38:18.371
Call an ambulance!

38:18.372 --> 38:20.011
We're going to have to kill her.

38:20.012 --> 38:23.251
I can't do it before she changes.

38:23.252 --> 38:26.331
What are you saying? I need an
ambulance!

38:26.332 --> 38:28.091
How long does it take?

38:28.092 --> 38:32.091
It seems to vary. I need help!

38:33.052 --> 38:37.051
Give her a few more minutes.

38:37.972 --> 38:39.771
We'll get you an ambulance.

38:39.772 --> 38:42.091
Just... just hold in there.

38:42.092 --> 38:46.091
You'll be fine.

38:52.716 --> 38:54.675
If you were planning on bringing her
back from the dead,

38:54.676 --> 38:56.715
why did you get together with me?

38:56.716 --> 38:58.515
Was I just the shag until you dug
her up?

38:58.516 --> 39:01.035
No!

39:01.036 --> 39:03.875
I thought it wasn't going to happen.

39:03.876 --> 39:05.355
And then I met you, and...

39:05.356 --> 39:08.595
everything changed.

39:08.596 --> 39:12.595
Then I found the power, and... I
didn't know what to do.

39:12.916 --> 39:15.635
When you was with me, did you think
of her?

39:15.636 --> 39:18.835
No.

39:27.596 --> 39:31.595
Still want me to dress up as a
cheerleader for your birthday?

39:32.316 --> 39:34.395
No.

39:34.396 --> 39:38.395
Can we just find
the other two, yeah?

40:07.396 --> 40:11.395
Oh, fucking cheerleaders!

40:14.876 --> 40:18.875
Urgh, urgh!

40:18.916 --> 40:22.555
Oh, that's enough!

40:22.556 --> 40:24.115
Ohhh!

40:24.116 --> 40:28.115
Have you... have you finished?

40:32.876 --> 40:36.115
Nice! Eh?

40:36.116 --> 40:38.035
You got 'em. Yes!

40:38.036 --> 40:42.035
Yes.

40:42.156 --> 40:45.755
It's not really an 'igh-five
moment, is it?

40:45.756 --> 40:47.555
It's not.

40:47.556 --> 40:50.875
I screwed up, all right?

40:50.876 --> 40:53.715
I know I hurt you.

40:53.716 --> 40:57.435
I'm sorry.There you are. Nice
one.

40:57.436 --> 40:59.475
You got one. We got another three!

40:59.476 --> 41:00.995
You didn't do fuck all!

41:00.996 --> 41:02.555
You hid in the fucking kitchen.

41:02.556 --> 41:06.555
So, how many does that leave?
Just one.

41:23.956 --> 41:25.355
Who are you?

41:25.356 --> 41:27.635
I'm the new probation worker.

41:29.436 --> 41:33.435
Oh, shit!

41:42.756 --> 41:44.595
Jesus!

41:44.596 --> 41:48.595
She bit me!

41:54.916 --> 41:56.995
She's been bitten?

41:56.996 --> 41:59.315
We're going to have to kill her when
she changes.

41:59.316 --> 42:01.515
So, even when we don't kill our
probation worker,

42:01.516 --> 42:03.195
we have to kill our probation
worker.

42:03.196 --> 42:06.035
Oh, come on, someone's definitely
fucking with us here!

42:06.036 --> 42:09.835
We should really do something about
all these bodies.

42:09.836 --> 42:13.835
So, who's going to kill the probation
worker?

42:14.516 --> 42:18.515
I'll go and get the straws.

42:21.116 --> 42:25.115
Get a decent-sized boot on these
BMWs, don't you?

42:25.796 --> 42:29.795
I'll go and get the shovels.

42:35.476 --> 42:38.475
He was mine.

42:38.476 --> 42:39.915
And you took him from me!

42:39.916 --> 42:42.315
I didn't take him from no-one. You
were dead!

42:42.316 --> 42:45.795
He doesn't want me any more, and
it's all because of you.

42:45.796 --> 42:47.595
Look, I didn't go out to steal your
boyfriend.

42:47.596 --> 42:49.795
Other than you being a zombie, I
haven't got a problem with you.

42:49.796 --> 42:52.315
When you're like me, he won't want
you either!

42:52.316 --> 42:56.155
Get away from her!

42:56.156 --> 42:57.795
What are you going to do?

42:57.796 --> 43:01.675
Are you going to kill me again?!

43:01.676 --> 43:04.835
I love you!

43:04.836 --> 43:07.315
And I loved you.

43:07.316 --> 43:10.995
But after I brought you back, it was
different.

43:10.996 --> 43:14.515
I'd changed.

43:14.516 --> 43:17.435
I love someone else.

43:17.436 --> 43:19.235
You bastard.

43:19.236 --> 43:21.795
I'm sorry.

43:34.396 --> 43:38.395
Did you mean what you just said to
her?

43:38.476 --> 43:41.355
Yeah.

43:41.356 --> 43:44.915
Good, cos I fucking love you too.
Just don't ever do anything like
that again.

43:44.916 --> 43:48.915
I won't.

44:03.076 --> 44:07.075
We just want you to know that, um...

44:07.716 --> 44:11.715
this isn't our fault. We're... in
the wrong place...

44:13.556 --> 44:16.475
at the wrong time.

44:16.476 --> 44:20.475
A lot.

44:20.916 --> 44:23.035
We're really not bad kids.

44:23.036 --> 44:25.315
Yeah.

44:56.596 --> 44:58.475
We did it.

44:58.476 --> 45:02.115
We stopped the zombies infecting
everyone.

45:02.116 --> 45:04.275
I can't believe we didn't screw that
up!

45:04.276 --> 45:06.995
Are you actually saying we saved the
world?

45:06.996 --> 45:08.995
We saved the world.

45:08.996 --> 45:12.155
That is proper superhero shit.

45:12.156 --> 45:14.515
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is!

45:14.516 --> 45:18.515
Eh? And I think I'm over my old
cheerleader phobia, you know?

45:18.796 --> 45:20.675
That brutal killing's been really
cathartic.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.235
In fact, if we hadn't killed 'em
all,

45:22.236 --> 45:24.555
I think I could've brought myself to
fuck one of 'em.

45:24.556 --> 45:28.555
Which is nice, so...

45:34.636 --> 45:38.035
What happened to Mr Miggles?

45:38.036 --> 45:42.035
Oh, shit!

45:43.156 --> 45:46.195
I'm getting a message from the
spirit world. It's for you...

45:46.196 --> 45:50.195
She's crying. She wants to know
why...

45:50.796 --> 45:52.355
why you did it.

45:52.356 --> 45:54.115
You're supposed to be dead.

45:54.116 --> 45:56.115
I think I've come back for you.

45:56.116 --> 45:57.155
What is it?

45:57.156 --> 45:59.075
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

45:59.076 --> 46:00.595
Why do they come back?

46:00.596 --> 46:03.155
Usually it's cos they've got some
unfinished business with the living.

46:03.156 --> 46:04.195
What is this?

46:04.196 --> 46:05.675
Isn't that the girl who brainwashed
us?

46:05.676 --> 46:07.355
Would you like to see my penis?

46:07.356 --> 46:11.355
It's the probation worker. He's come
back from the dead! He's just chased
me!

46:12.076 --> 46:14.953
I'm going to need to get some new
powers.

46:14.978 --> 46:20.278
