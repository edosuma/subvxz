00:12.170 --> 00:13.920
We have won the Great War.

00:15.045 --> 00:16.503
Now we will win the last war.

00:16.879 --> 00:19.003
The objective here is to remove Cersei

00:19.086 --> 00:20.961
without destroying King's Landing.

00:23.295 --> 00:24.920
You heading to King's Landing?

00:25.128 --> 00:26.961
There's some unfinished business.

00:27.253 --> 00:28.170
Me too.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.253
I don't plan on coming back.

00:31.086 --> 00:32.420
Neither do I.

00:34.045 --> 00:37.295
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

00:38.253 --> 00:39.920
Seems like I won't get the chance.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.712
Stay with me.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.086
Please.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.920
Cersei's hateful...

00:49.420 --> 00:50.462
And so am I.

00:59.337 --> 01:00.795
I need to tell you something.

01:03.295 --> 01:06.253
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

01:06.337 --> 01:09.420
What if there's someone else?
Someone better.

01:09.879 --> 01:12.629
At a certain point, you choose
a person you believe in,

01:12.712 --> 01:14.045
and you fight for that person.

01:14.128 --> 01:16.337
Even if you know it's a mistake?

01:19.128 --> 01:20.629
He has the better claim to the throne.

01:20.712 --> 01:22.253
Every time a Targaryen is born,

01:22.337 --> 01:23.337
the gods flip a coin.

01:23.754 --> 01:25.337
The Mad King
gave his enemies the justice

01:25.420 --> 01:26.462
he thought they deserved.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.712
Children are not their fathers.

01:28.337 --> 01:29.879
- Be a dragon.
- You have a gentle heart.

01:29.961 --> 01:32.378
A Targaryen alone in the world

01:32.462 --> 01:33.670
is a terrible thing.

01:34.003 --> 01:35.795
You don't
want to awake the dragon, do you?

03:20.610 --> 03:30.610
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

04:05.295 --> 04:06.211
Come in.

04:10.211 --> 04:11.337
And?

04:13.128 --> 04:14.670
Nothing?

04:14.754 --> 04:16.378
She won't eat.

04:21.253 --> 04:23.462
We'll try again at supper.

04:25.712 --> 04:27.378
I think they're watching me.

04:28.378 --> 04:32.295
- Who?
- Her soldiers.

04:32.378 --> 04:36.337
Of course they are.
That's their job.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.295
What have I told you, Martha?

04:49.629 --> 04:52.837
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

04:54.170 --> 04:57.045
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.211
The Northern armies?

05:22.295 --> 05:23.795
Just crossed the Trident.

05:23.879 --> 05:26.754
They'll be at the walls
of King's Landing in two days.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.420
How is she?

05:29.503 --> 05:32.128
She hasn't seen anyone
since we returned.

05:32.211 --> 05:35.545
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.462
She shouldn't be alone.

05:38.545 --> 05:41.629
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

05:41.712 --> 05:43.587
Aren't you worried for her?

05:43.670 --> 05:45.795
I'm worried for all of us.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.045
They say every time
a Targaryen is born,

05:48.128 --> 05:51.337
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.170
We're not much for riddles
where I'm from.

05:54.253 --> 05:57.086
We both know what she's about to do.

06:02.961 --> 06:05.086
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

06:05.170 --> 06:09.295
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

06:11.837 --> 06:13.629
What do you want?

06:13.712 --> 06:15.462
All I've ever wanted.

06:15.545 --> 06:18.462
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.

06:20.003 --> 06:22.837
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.253
But I'm quite certain about yours.

06:34.295 --> 06:36.211
I don't want it.

06:36.295 --> 06:37.629
I never have.

06:40.086 --> 06:43.795
I have known more kings
and queens than any man living.

06:43.879 --> 06:45.545
I've heard what they say to crowds,

06:45.629 --> 06:47.462
and seen what they do in the shadows.

06:47.545 --> 06:50.920
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

06:51.003 --> 06:53.712
But what I tell you now is true:

06:53.795 --> 06:57.003
You will rule wisely and well,
while she--

06:57.086 --> 06:58.879
She...

06:58.961 --> 07:00.045
is my queen.

07:21.879 --> 07:23.337
Your Grace?

07:48.545 --> 07:51.003
There's something you need to know.

07:52.295 --> 07:54.545
Someone has betrayed me.

08:00.712 --> 08:02.086
Yes.

08:06.045 --> 08:07.837
Jon Snow.

08:13.712 --> 08:14.670
Varys.

08:16.879 --> 08:19.003
He knows the truth about Jon.

08:20.295 --> 08:21.837
He does.

08:26.587 --> 08:28.920
Because you told him.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.961
You learned from Sansa.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.587
And she learned from Jon,

08:35.669 --> 08:38.253
though I begged him not to tell her.

08:39.629 --> 08:41.462
As I said...

08:42.211 --> 08:43.294
he betrayed me.

08:43.378 --> 08:45.211
I'm glad Sansa told me.

08:45.295 --> 08:46.837
I am your Hand.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.420
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.211
And Varys?

08:52.295 --> 08:55.420
Your Master of Whisperers
needs to be aware too.

08:56.253 --> 08:58.670
You spoke to him first.

08:58.754 --> 09:00.003
Without coming to me.

09:00.086 --> 09:02.545
Without asking my permission.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.795
It was a mistake.

09:08.795 --> 09:11.587
Why do you think Sansa told you?

09:11.670 --> 09:13.378
What do you think she hoped to gain?

09:13.462 --> 09:17.086
- She trusts me.
- Yes, she trusts you.

09:18.211 --> 09:22.295
She trusted you to spread secrets

09:22.378 --> 09:25.462
that could destroy your own queen.

09:27.462 --> 09:29.754
And you did not let her down.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.961
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

09:38.837 --> 09:41.128
Our intentions were good.

09:42.545 --> 09:46.128
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.211
Varys as much as anyone.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.045
But it doesn't matter now.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.170
No.

10:05.503 --> 10:07.170
It doesn't matter now.

12:07.629 --> 12:09.587
It was me.

12:14.961 --> 12:16.587
I hope I deserve this.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.337
Truly, I do.

12:18.420 --> 12:20.503
I hope I'm wrong.

12:28.045 --> 12:29.128
Goodbye, old friend.

13:10.629 --> 13:11.712
Lord Varys.

13:13.462 --> 13:15.629
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,

13:15.712 --> 13:17.545
First of My Name,

13:17.629 --> 13:20.879
Breaker of Chains
and Mother of Dragons...

13:22.712 --> 13:24.754
sentence you to die.

13:35.253 --> 13:36.378
Dracarys.

14:27.545 --> 14:29.128
This was all she brought with her

14:29.211 --> 14:31.128
when we crossed the Narrow Sea.

14:32.211 --> 14:34.253
Her only possession.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.170
_

15:21.290 --> 15:22.652
_

15:49.961 --> 15:52.587
What did I say would
happen if you told your sister?

15:52.670 --> 15:55.961
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

15:57.253 --> 15:59.462
She betrayed your trust.

15:59.545 --> 16:01.295
She killed Varys as much as I did.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.378
This was a victory for her.

16:06.879 --> 16:08.086
Now she knows what happens

16:08.170 --> 16:10.086
when people hear the truth about you.

16:12.712 --> 16:16.712
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.587
I don't have love here.

16:23.045 --> 16:25.086
I only have fear.

16:28.003 --> 16:29.879
I love you.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.211
And you will always be my queen.

16:42.045 --> 16:44.045
Is that all I am to you?

16:45.795 --> 16:47.754
Your queen?

17:24.628 --> 17:26.587
All right, then.

17:33.961 --> 17:35.795
Let it be fear.

17:39.795 --> 17:43.045
The people who live
there, they're not your enemies.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.879
They're innocents, like the ones
you liberated in Meereen.

17:45.961 --> 17:47.879
In Meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

17:47.961 --> 17:51.045
and liberated the city
themselves the moment I arrived.

17:51.128 --> 17:52.337
They're afraid.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.670
Anyone who resists Cersei

17:53.754 --> 17:55.879
will see his family butchered.

17:55.961 --> 17:58.170
You can't expect them to be heroes.

17:58.253 --> 18:00.378
- They're hostages.
- They are.

18:00.462 --> 18:03.795
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

18:03.879 --> 18:06.503
What does it matter whose fault it is?

18:06.587 --> 18:09.462
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

18:09.545 --> 18:10.795
Your sister knows how to use

18:10.879 --> 18:12.920
her enemies' weaknesses against them.

18:13.003 --> 18:15.420
That's what she thinks our mercy is:

18:15.503 --> 18:16.670
weakness.

18:16.754 --> 18:18.837
- I beg you, my queen--
- But she's wrong.

18:19.712 --> 18:21.503
Mercy is our strength.

18:22.754 --> 18:25.128
Our mercy towards future generations

18:25.211 --> 18:27.795
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

18:33.754 --> 18:35.378
Ready the Unsullied.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.003
Tonight you sail for King's Landing

18:37.086 --> 18:38.920
- to join the Northern armies.
- Cersei's followers

18:39.003 --> 18:40.879
will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

18:40.961 --> 18:42.128
Give them that chance.

18:42.211 --> 18:44.503
If the city surrenders,

18:44.587 --> 18:46.629
they will ring the bells
and raise the gates.

18:46.712 --> 18:50.378
Please, if you hear them ringing
the bells, call off the attack.

18:58.545 --> 19:00.545
Wait for me outside the city.

19:01.629 --> 19:03.337
You'll know when it's time.

19:32.879 --> 19:36.754
Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

19:41.086 --> 19:44.587
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

19:50.295 --> 19:51.920
The next time you fail me...

19:53.295 --> 19:55.754
will be the last time you fail me.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.545
Let them pass.

20:25.961 --> 20:27.545
Through the gate.

20:27.629 --> 20:28.961
Get going.

21:10.545 --> 21:13.462
The rearguard
should be here by daybreak.

21:13.545 --> 21:16.003
She wants to attack now.

21:17.211 --> 21:18.670
Daybreak at the earliest.

21:20.170 --> 21:23.337
- Careful with that.
- My lord.

21:25.795 --> 21:27.003
Davos.

21:29.587 --> 21:31.879
I need to ask you a favor.

21:34.003 --> 21:36.503
You're the greatest smuggler
alive, aren't you?

21:38.045 --> 21:41.420
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

21:41.503 --> 21:43.961
He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

21:44.045 --> 21:47.211
Problem is when he's got drink in him.

21:47.295 --> 21:48.754
See what he did the other week?

21:48.837 --> 21:50.420
Aye. Fighting as well.

21:50.503 --> 21:51.879
Commander nearly caught him.

21:51.961 --> 21:54.837
Ay up. Where you going?

21:56.253 --> 21:58.253
I'm Arya Stark.

21:58.337 --> 22:00.879
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

22:05.378 --> 22:06.378
Think about it.

22:06.462 --> 22:09.086
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

22:09.170 --> 22:12.545
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

22:15.837 --> 22:17.670
I need to go talk to my captain.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.754
Go ahead, talk to him.

22:22.503 --> 22:24.211
Where's he going?

22:38.253 --> 22:41.754
_

22:43.434 --> 22:46.325
_

22:50.871 --> 22:53.991
_

22:54.337 --> 22:55.920
We speak the common tongue.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.837
Ah. Good.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.670
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.920
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

23:03.003 --> 23:05.378
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

23:05.462 --> 23:07.253
Ordered by whom?
The queen herself?

23:08.462 --> 23:10.420
- No.
- Well, in that case,

23:10.503 --> 23:13.462
as Hand of the Queen, I outrank
whomever gave your order.

23:13.545 --> 23:15.086
Probably by quite a lot.

23:38.795 --> 23:40.795
How did they find you?

23:48.961 --> 23:51.378
Did you consider taking it off?

23:52.837 --> 23:56.295
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

23:57.795 --> 24:01.045
And you're going back to her,
to die with her.

24:02.211 --> 24:03.837
You've underestimated her before.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.295
She's going to die.

24:06.462 --> 24:07.879
Unless you can convince her

24:07.961 --> 24:09.587
to change her course of action.

24:09.670 --> 24:11.670
Difficult to do from here.

24:17.295 --> 24:20.420
When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

24:20.503 --> 24:22.086
Try.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.128
If not for yourself, if not for her,

24:24.211 --> 24:26.961
then for every one of the
million people in that city,

24:27.045 --> 24:28.378
innocent or otherwise.

24:28.462 --> 24:31.462
To be honest, I never really
cared much for them.

24:31.545 --> 24:33.211
Innocent or otherwise.

24:34.545 --> 24:36.670
You do care for one innocent.

24:37.587 --> 24:39.086
I know you do.

24:39.170 --> 24:40.920
And so does Cersei.

24:42.211 --> 24:43.920
She has a reason now.

24:45.378 --> 24:49.128
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

24:49.211 --> 24:51.003
All the worst things she's ever done,

24:51.086 --> 24:53.462
she's done for her children.

24:53.545 --> 24:55.712
It's not impossible that she'll win.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.003
She won't.

24:57.086 --> 24:58.961
Her enemy's forces have been depleted,

24:59.045 --> 25:00.420
as she said they would be.

25:00.503 --> 25:02.754
Two of the three dragons are dead.

25:02.837 --> 25:05.378
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.378
She has the Lannister army,
she has the Golden Company--

25:07.462 --> 25:09.170
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

25:09.253 --> 25:11.837
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.170
Then I suppose I'll die
tomorrow, if not before.

25:14.253 --> 25:15.920
Why?

25:22.128 --> 25:23.629
Escape.

25:23.712 --> 25:25.712
The two of you, together.

25:25.795 --> 25:27.045
Remember where we met,

25:27.128 --> 25:28.795
where they keep the dragon skulls,

25:28.879 --> 25:29.920
beneath the Red Keep?

25:31.587 --> 25:32.879
Take her down there.

25:32.961 --> 25:34.629
Keep following the stairways down,

25:34.712 --> 25:36.086
down as far as they'll go.

25:36.170 --> 25:38.503
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

25:38.587 --> 25:40.545
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

25:41.754 --> 25:43.128
Sail out of the bay.

25:43.211 --> 25:45.920
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to Pentos.

25:47.086 --> 25:49.503
Start a new life.

25:52.837 --> 25:56.170
Sail right past the Iron Fleet
and into a new life?

25:56.253 --> 25:58.920
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war--

25:59.003 --> 26:01.629
There won't be an Iron Fleet
for much longer.

26:02.837 --> 26:04.086
Do it.

26:04.170 --> 26:07.295
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.961
Swear to me.

26:18.253 --> 26:20.170
You have my word.

26:24.795 --> 26:26.211
If it works,

26:26.295 --> 26:27.961
give the order to ring all the bells

26:28.045 --> 26:29.795
in King's Landing and open the gates.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.670
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

26:32.754 --> 26:34.211
I'll try.

26:35.629 --> 26:38.003
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

26:38.086 --> 26:40.795
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

26:40.879 --> 26:43.420
Your queen will execute you for this.

26:43.503 --> 26:45.253
If Daenerys can make it to the throne

26:45.337 --> 26:47.337
without wading through
a river of blood,

26:47.420 --> 26:48.545
maybe she'll show mercy

26:48.629 --> 26:50.837
to the person who made that possible.

26:56.587 --> 26:59.337
Tens of thousands of innocent lives...

27:00.629 --> 27:03.837
one not particularly innocent dwarf...

27:05.253 --> 27:07.837
it seems like a fair trade.

27:14.378 --> 27:16.378
If it weren't for you,

27:16.462 --> 27:18.629
I never would've survived my childhood.

27:20.754 --> 27:22.587
You would have.

27:30.211 --> 27:31.754
You were the only one

27:32.961 --> 27:35.879
who didn't treat me like a monster.

27:38.462 --> 27:40.712
You were all I had.

28:51.587 --> 28:54.003
Eyes on the horizon!

28:55.295 --> 28:57.295
Load the scorpion!

29:10.545 --> 29:11.961
Archers, close up!

29:12.045 --> 29:13.420
Come on!

29:13.503 --> 29:15.503
Up to the espringal!

29:15.587 --> 29:17.795
To the back of it!

29:29.754 --> 29:31.462
Archers, line up!

29:39.503 --> 29:41.003
This way! Come on!

29:41.086 --> 29:42.670
Clear the streets now!

29:42.754 --> 29:45.003
- No!
- In, now.

29:45.086 --> 29:47.754
- And you, come on.
- Inside, now!

29:47.837 --> 29:49.253
Quickly.

29:49.337 --> 29:50.420
Yes. Follow down there.

29:50.503 --> 29:52.295
They're here.
Get to the Red Keep.

29:54.003 --> 29:55.961
- My son!
- Get inside!

30:00.295 --> 30:02.211
Just ahead of you, I can see it!

30:02.295 --> 30:03.629
All right, move it!

30:03.712 --> 30:05.545
- Come on!
- Keep moving!

30:05.629 --> 30:07.295
- Keep going!
- Keep moving!

30:07.378 --> 30:09.128
- Quickly!
- All the way!

30:09.211 --> 30:11.128
- Come on!
- Come on!

30:11.211 --> 30:13.337
Hold your mother's hand!

30:26.086 --> 30:30.003
Make way for the Golden Company!

30:39.045 --> 30:40.295
Close the gate!

31:44.754 --> 31:47.795
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

31:47.879 --> 31:49.795
Call off your men.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.378
Move along now, lads.

32:33.128 --> 32:35.712
- That's it.
- Go on, move it.

32:38.961 --> 32:42.211
Come on, move, move.
Faster, faster. Come on, move it.

32:42.295 --> 32:44.128
- Keep going.
- Keep moving.

32:47.961 --> 32:50.337
- Move.
- Stay with him.

32:51.545 --> 32:53.128
- Hold on.
- Hold my hand.

32:53.211 --> 32:54.420
Get behind there.

32:54.503 --> 32:56.629
Close the gate!

32:56.712 --> 32:58.337
No more through.

33:01.211 --> 33:03.754
- No.
- No. Mommy.

33:03.837 --> 33:06.629
- Vicky! Please!
- No, please, sir!

33:06.712 --> 33:09.086
- Open the gate!
- Close the gate!

33:09.170 --> 33:11.003
- Open it!
- Open the gate!

33:11.086 --> 33:14.879
- Get back.
- Look, try that one. Go. Go.

33:20.712 --> 33:22.795
The gates are locked now!

33:22.879 --> 33:24.211
Open!

33:24.295 --> 33:26.462
- Get back!
- Open the gate!

33:26.545 --> 33:29.253
Soldier! Soldier!

33:29.337 --> 33:32.337
- Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!

33:32.420 --> 33:33.920
Stay back! It's closed!

33:34.003 --> 33:35.420
Soldier!

33:36.920 --> 33:38.211
Move away! Stop!

33:38.295 --> 33:40.961
Let us in!

33:43.420 --> 33:45.587
We're not leaving!

34:54.045 --> 34:55.337
Turn!

35:14.503 --> 35:18.337
- Turn it around!
- Turn it around!

35:21.170 --> 35:23.170
Get back! Back!

35:27.754 --> 35:29.128
Fire!

35:49.378 --> 35:51.670
I can see her!

35:51.754 --> 35:52.920
Ready!

35:53.003 --> 35:54.337
Move!

35:56.545 --> 35:57.670
Fire!

36:01.879 --> 36:03.837
- Reload!
- Reload!

36:03.920 --> 36:05.587
Faster!

36:05.670 --> 36:06.879
Hurry!

36:16.170 --> 36:17.211
Fire!

39:38.629 --> 39:40.295
Go!

39:43.545 --> 39:45.462
Run!

39:57.837 --> 39:58.920
Your Grace.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.253
All we need is one good shot.

40:02.337 --> 40:06.128
The scorpions have
all been destroyed, Your Grace.

40:07.961 --> 40:10.754
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay.

40:12.170 --> 40:14.045
Euron killed one of her dragons.

40:14.128 --> 40:15.545
He can kill another.

40:15.629 --> 40:18.795
Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning.

40:18.879 --> 40:21.045
The gates have been breached.

40:21.128 --> 40:22.587
The Golden Company--

40:22.670 --> 40:26.128
Our men will fight harder
than sellswords ever could.

40:27.795 --> 40:29.879
They will defend their queen
to the last man.

40:29.961 --> 40:33.170
- Yes, Your Grace.
- The Red Keep has never fallen.

40:33.253 --> 40:35.211
It won't fall today.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.712
No, no, no!

41:08.920 --> 41:10.879
Move, move!

42:12.503 --> 42:13.920
Run.

42:14.003 --> 42:15.503
Run!

42:15.587 --> 42:16.754
Come on!

43:08.378 --> 43:11.837
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

43:12.712 --> 43:14.045
The bells!

43:14.128 --> 43:17.211
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

43:17.295 --> 43:19.420
Ring the bloody bells!

43:19.503 --> 43:22.170
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

43:23.587 --> 43:25.462
Tell the queen to ring the bells.

43:25.545 --> 43:27.961
Ring the bells! Ring the bell!

43:36.170 --> 43:37.503
This way.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.211
Ring the bell!

43:45.211 --> 43:46.920
Ring the bell!

43:47.003 --> 43:48.337
Ring them!

43:51.629 --> 43:53.712
Ring the bells!

43:57.086 --> 43:59.587
Ring the bells!

43:59.670 --> 44:03.128
- Ring the bells!
- Help us!

44:03.211 --> 44:04.503
In the name of the--

44:06.045 --> 44:08.003
Queen! We're surrounded!

44:15.211 --> 44:17.712
- Ring the bells!
- Now! Come on!

44:24.837 --> 44:25.879
Hurry up!

44:35.712 --> 44:36.961
Ring the bells!

47:01.879 --> 47:03.045
No!

47:03.128 --> 47:04.253
Get back!

47:04.337 --> 47:05.378
Get back!

47:06.879 --> 47:08.920
Stay! Stay!

48:31.712 --> 48:33.462
No, no, no, no, no.

48:42.545 --> 48:44.670
Quickly. Quickly.

48:46.712 --> 48:48.170
Stop!

49:11.503 --> 49:14.337
- Get off me! Get off, bitch!
- No, get off! Help! Help!

49:15.378 --> 49:16.462
No!

49:46.462 --> 49:47.670
Go!

49:49.045 --> 49:50.170
Go!

50:27.837 --> 50:29.712
Find somewhere to hide.

50:54.211 --> 50:55.462
My God!

51:14.420 --> 51:16.295
The Kingslayer.

51:18.795 --> 51:21.712
We need to get the
queen out of King's Landing.

51:21.795 --> 51:23.420
Listen.

51:23.503 --> 51:26.961
That's the sound of a city dying.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.086
It's over.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.003
Well, maybe for you.

51:33.295 --> 51:36.337
If you kill another king
before you die...

51:37.545 --> 51:39.295
they'll sing about you forever.

51:40.337 --> 51:42.003
You're no king.

51:42.086 --> 51:43.503
Oh, but I am.

51:45.295 --> 51:47.003
And I fucked the queen.

51:50.670 --> 51:51.712
If I win...

51:52.961 --> 51:54.420
I'll bring your head to Cersei

51:54.503 --> 51:57.587
so you can kiss her one last time.

53:41.253 --> 53:43.420
Your Grace, it isn't safe here
any longer.

53:43.503 --> 53:45.545
The Red Keep is the safest place
in the city.

53:45.629 --> 53:49.003
The Unsullied have
breached the gates of the Red Keep.

53:57.545 --> 54:00.712
Maegor's Holdfast
would be a better place

54:00.795 --> 54:02.170
to wait out the storm.

54:39.545 --> 54:41.503
You fought well...

54:42.503 --> 54:43.879
for a cripple.

55:28.211 --> 55:29.545
Another king for you.

55:44.795 --> 55:45.795
But I got you!

55:49.045 --> 55:50.086
I got you!

55:56.587 --> 55:59.420
I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.

56:23.879 --> 56:24.961
Go home, girl.

56:26.086 --> 56:27.670
The fire will get her,

56:27.754 --> 56:29.503
or one of the Dothraki.

56:30.754 --> 56:33.462
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

56:33.545 --> 56:35.545
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

56:35.629 --> 56:38.420
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

56:39.462 --> 56:40.837
I'm going to kill her.

56:42.378 --> 56:45.211
You think you wanted revenge
a long time?

56:45.295 --> 56:46.920
I've been after it all my life.

56:47.003 --> 56:49.170
It's all I care about.

56:49.253 --> 56:51.629
And look at me. Look at me!

56:53.629 --> 56:55.961
You wanna be like me?

57:02.795 --> 57:07.003
You come with me, you die here.

57:20.378 --> 57:21.795
Sandor.

57:28.670 --> 57:30.337
Thank you.

58:32.629 --> 58:34.378
Your Grace.

58:51.086 --> 58:53.420
Hello, big brother.

58:59.337 --> 59:01.920
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

59:11.837 --> 59:13.211
Ser Gregor, I command you.

59:13.295 --> 59:14.837
Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.879
Yeah, that's you.

01:00:17.128 --> 01:00:19.003
That's what you've always been.

01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:55.086
You're hurt.

01:01:56.961 --> 01:01:58.295
It doesn't matter.

01:02:05.961 --> 01:02:07.795
You're bleeding.

01:03:50.337 --> 01:03:52.295
Alanna!

01:03:52.378 --> 01:03:54.795
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

01:03:54.879 --> 01:03:56.670
Have you seen my wife?

01:03:56.754 --> 01:03:58.378
- Let go.
- Have you seen my wife?

01:04:14.295 --> 01:04:15.754
Out of the way!

01:04:43.337 --> 01:04:44.629
No!

01:05:15.503 --> 01:05:16.961
Oh.

01:05:46.253 --> 01:05:47.754
Take my hand.

01:05:47.837 --> 01:05:49.754
Take my hand.

01:05:49.837 --> 01:05:51.295
Get up. Get up.

01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:03.086
- No. No.
- Wait! Wait!

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:04.170
No!

01:06:48.712 --> 01:06:50.253
Fucking die!

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:26.211
We need to fall back!

01:08:26.295 --> 01:08:29.170
Fall back behind the wall!

01:08:30.337 --> 01:08:31.920
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

01:08:32.002 --> 01:08:33.502
Get out of the city!

01:08:35.002 --> 01:08:36.295
Fall back!

01:08:40.002 --> 01:08:41.377
Fall back!

01:08:41.462 --> 01:08:43.127
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

01:10:39.295 --> 01:10:41.670
You can't stay here.

01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:43.378
You have to keep moving.

01:10:43.462 --> 01:10:45.045
We can't go out there.

01:10:45.128 --> 01:10:46.086
You have to.

01:10:47.337 --> 01:10:49.170
Everyone out there is dead.

01:10:50.462 --> 01:10:52.629
If you stay here, you'll die.

01:10:54.253 --> 01:10:55.253
Follow me.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:58.170
Follow me!

01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:03.462
Come on, quickly. Come to me.

01:11:03.545 --> 01:11:05.337
Lean him up there.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:07.337
Come on, quickly. All of you!

01:11:11.337 --> 01:11:12.337
Run!

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:19.128
Run!

01:11:24.003 --> 01:11:26.003
Mama!

01:11:26.086 --> 01:11:27.378
Mama!

01:11:27.462 --> 01:11:29.420
Mama! No.

01:11:29.503 --> 01:11:31.378
Mama! Mama!

01:11:32.712 --> 01:11:33.670
Mama!

01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:40.295
Get up.

01:11:40.378 --> 01:11:41.795
Get up!

01:11:45.712 --> 01:11:46.920
We have to keep moving.

01:11:48.462 --> 01:11:49.961
Take her.

01:11:50.045 --> 01:11:51.920
Take her!

01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:54.503
- Take her.
- Come on!

01:11:54.587 --> 01:11:55.545
Come on!

01:12:16.211 --> 01:12:17.211
This way.

01:13:07.587 --> 01:13:10.086
I want our baby to live.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.295
I want our baby to live.

01:13:17.879 --> 01:13:19.629
I want our baby to live.

01:13:21.295 --> 01:13:23.837
Don't let me die, Jaime.
Please don't let me die.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.045
It's all right.

01:13:25.128 --> 01:13:26.961
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

01:13:27.045 --> 01:13:28.003
I don't want to die.

01:13:30.795 --> 01:13:32.545
Just look-- Look at me.

01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:34.670
- Look at me.
- Not like this.

01:13:34.754 --> 01:13:36.211
Not like this. Not like this.

01:13:36.295 --> 01:13:38.045
Look-- Look-- Look me in the eye.

01:13:38.128 --> 01:13:39.587
Don't look away. Don't look--

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:41.920
Look at me! Just look at me.

01:13:46.462 --> 01:13:48.670
Nothing else matters.

01:13:51.211 --> 01:13:53.253
Nothing else matters.

01:13:53.337 --> 01:13:55.211
Only us.
