00:01.169 --> 00:03.204
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer--

00:03.237 --> 00:06.474
All right.
You want to fry a witch?
I'll give you a witch.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.343
Before thee,
let the unclean thing crawl!

00:12.445 --> 00:14.414
WILLOW:
 She's a perfectly normal girl.

00:14.448 --> 00:18.652
-Then she's a rat.
-Maybe we should get her one
of those wheel thingies.

00:18.686 --> 00:22.989
-Can-- Can we not do this now?
-Forget it ever happened.

00:23.022 --> 00:25.024
Forget.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.393
What is wrong with you?

00:26.426 --> 00:28.096
I know you used
that spell on me.

00:28.129 --> 00:31.664
I will go a month
without doing any magic.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.268
-Go a week.
-Fine. That's easy.

00:34.301 --> 00:39.707
When the fire goes out,
when the crystal turns black,
the spell will be cast.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.509
TARA:
 I don't think
 this is gonna work.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.279
WILLOW:
 Are you saying
 you're gonna leave me?

00:45.313 --> 00:47.081
I'm placing an order.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.948
Oh, no, no. I'm not making
any more girls.

00:48.981 --> 00:52.753
Sure you are.
Here's your specs.

00:52.786 --> 00:56.055
So, you guys wanna team up
and take over Sunnydale?

00:57.125 --> 00:58.725
Okay.
Okay.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.228
WARREN:
 The trio versus the Slayer.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.864
We're like super-villains.
(diabolical laugh)

01:04.897 --> 01:07.900
I can't do this without you.
You can.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.602
That's why I'm going.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.906
I'm headed back to England,

01:12.939 --> 01:15.709
and I plan to stay.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.777
We have to talk.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.447
About what?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.149
We kissed, Buffy.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.293
I'm sure we can
work something out.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.462
A deal of some sort.
Anything you want.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.963
BUFFY:
I always wanted a pony.

01:36.996 --> 01:40.901
Oh. You weren't really
speaking to me, were you?

01:40.933 --> 01:43.503
My bad. Well,
as long as I'm here--

01:45.539 --> 01:47.841
MAN: Lady!
BUFFY:
Wow. A mugging.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.611
Haven't gotten
one of those in a while.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.682
Usually it's blood,
and with the horror--

01:54.715 --> 01:57.016
just a good
old-fashioned mugging.

01:57.049 --> 01:59.652
Kinda sweet, actually.

01:59.686 --> 02:02.423
Oh, well,
probably not for you.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.358
Here. Go. Now.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.832
Not too sweet
for you, either, huh?

02:12.865 --> 02:15.368
Well, come on. Rush me.
It'll be funny.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.570
-(Spike yells)
-No!

02:21.709 --> 02:24.777
-(frustrated sigh)
-Ow!

02:24.812 --> 02:28.681
-What the hell are you doing?
-I thought they were demons.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.352
Way to go with
the keen observy-ness,
Jessica Fletcher.

02:31.384 --> 02:34.987
-Remind me not to help you.
 -More often?

02:35.021 --> 02:38.225
Hey, a little sympathy for
the man with the migraine
here, can we?

02:38.259 --> 02:40.860
Well, that's what you get
for attacking a human.

02:40.894 --> 02:44.798
Yeah. You'd think if
the government was gonna
put a chip in my head,

02:44.831 --> 02:46.866
they'd at least make it
so I could attack criminals
and that sort.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.638
Yes, because muggers
deserve to be eaten.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.605
You just have to get
your rocks off fightin' demons.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.408
There are other ways.

02:56.776 --> 02:59.413
And to that,
an extreme "see you later."

03:01.514 --> 03:02.616
Buffy.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.687
(sighs)
Spike, it's late, okay?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.757
Can we just finish this
another time?

03:09.789 --> 03:13.360
Oh, so you wanna jump
right to the kissing, then, eh?

03:14.895 --> 03:17.664
I am not kissing you, Spike.
Once was--

03:17.698 --> 03:21.100
-Twice.
-But not again.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.372
You're a tease.
You know that, Slayer?

03:25.406 --> 03:28.408
Get a fella's motor revvin',
let the tension marinate
a couple of days,

03:28.442 --> 03:31.110
then bam-- crown yourself
the ice queen.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.213
You need a few more metaphors
for that little mix?

03:34.247 --> 03:38.252
It's only a matter of time
before you realize I'm
the only one here for you, pet.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.819
You got no one else!

04:00.073 --> 04:03.009
(squeaking)

04:07.146 --> 04:08.581
What's the matter, Amy?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.318
You lonely?

04:13.186 --> 04:16.255
Oh, we need to get you
a nice companion rat

04:16.290 --> 04:21.394
that you can love, play with,
and grow attached to

04:21.428 --> 04:24.798
until one day they leave you
for no good reason.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.033
Won't that be fun?

04:27.867 --> 04:29.370
Relax, Amy,
I'm just kidding.

04:31.504 --> 04:35.843
I swear, if I could figure out
how to turn you back--

04:38.211 --> 04:39.379
Any way.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.516
(speaking foreign word)

04:48.521 --> 04:52.692
(speaking foreign language)

05:11.512 --> 05:12.480
(screams)

05:14.213 --> 05:16.584
(theme music playing)

06:24.418 --> 06:25.853
Dude, what are you doing?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.387
We're not breaking
into Langley here.
It's Sunnydale.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.290
Well, you never know
what new stuff they have.

06:30.322 --> 06:31.792
Better safe than--

06:31.824 --> 06:34.562
Okay, the security system here
is a guy named Rusty.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.137
-Now get up.
-Whoa, head rush. Cool.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.574
Guys, come on. All right?
Quit jerkin' around.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.882
See, that's cool.
How come he gets to play

06:54.915 --> 06:56.483
with all the cool stuff?

06:56.516 --> 06:57.884
Because I'm allergic to methane

06:57.918 --> 06:59.386
and you're still
afraid of hot things.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.821
I know.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.524
Besides, the tank kept making
both of us tip over, remember?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.435
-Got it.
-It's beautiful.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.805
Boys, congratulations.
Phase one of the plan
is now complete.

07:18.838 --> 07:22.442
-Let's get the hell outta here.
-RUSTY: What are you boys doing?

07:22.475 --> 07:25.045
Um, we're with
a tour group.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.481
The get-the-freeze-ray
tour group.

07:28.516 --> 07:31.685
-Must have gotten separated.
-Museum closed five hours ago.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.086
Really?
Uh-huh.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.788
Huh. Guess we just
lost track of time,

07:35.822 --> 07:38.658
and should probably
just get the freeze ray
out of here now.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.968
'Cause we love
the learnin', Rusty.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.637
Museums, libraries,
Disney Hall of Presidents.

07:50.670 --> 07:55.576
Not boring. But more
to the point-- good-bye.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.348
Dude, that is so cool!

08:03.550 --> 08:08.221
The freeze ray
totally worked.
Yeah, uh, not exactly.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.391
So there's a kink or two.
It's just a prototype.
I mean, soon we'll have--

08:11.423 --> 08:13.160
Hey, that's
really neato and stuff,

08:13.192 --> 08:17.163
but in the meantime,
you know, ow!

08:17.197 --> 08:19.365
-Be a bigger wuss.
-Can we just go back
to the lair?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.334
Because I can't really
feel my fingers.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.036
Yeah, yeah, come on.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.009
-Is he gonna, like--
-He'll be fine.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.980
Yeah, he'll defrost
in a couple days.
No harm, no foul.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.914
Won't he tell on us?
And say what?

08:35.948 --> 08:38.018
"Two guys and a mime took
me out with their freeze ray"?

08:38.051 --> 08:41.187
Isn't likely. Come on.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.895
(door opens)

08:48.928 --> 08:52.665
Hey. Here's some
hot chocolate. You want--

08:52.700 --> 08:53.933
No, thanks.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.904
I'm still kinda queasy.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.575
Okay. Maybe later.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.143
(siren)

09:05.044 --> 09:07.914
Hey, no. It-It's okay.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.283
It's-- It's just a siren.

09:10.317 --> 09:14.386
It's o-- it's all right.
Okay? You okay?

09:14.421 --> 09:17.625
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.292
Just, you know--

09:20.559 --> 09:22.596
(whispering)
Everything feels weird.

09:22.629 --> 09:26.634
I mean, it's like--
I felt like I was
in that cage for weeks.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.870
But it can still be okay.
Right?

09:30.903 --> 09:33.807
I-I can still get into
the swing of things, like...

09:35.174 --> 09:36.375
prom's coming up.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.711
I was so hoping
Larry would ask me.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.681
We would make
such a splash at--

09:43.149 --> 09:46.385
Oh. Oh, God.

09:46.418 --> 09:49.255
(sighs)
He hasn't asked
someone else, has he?

09:50.322 --> 09:51.524
Uh, Amy...

09:52.993 --> 09:55.928
three things we
have to talk about.

09:55.962 --> 10:01.100
One, Larry's gay.
Two, Larry's dead.

10:01.134 --> 10:06.339
And three, high school's...
kinda over.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.878
How long was I
in the cage?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.014
How long?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.456
Willow?

10:29.663 --> 10:32.131
Hey.
How you doin'?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.836
Oh, um, okay.

10:36.870 --> 10:42.174
Yeah?
Yeah. Not parades
and cotton candy, but okay.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.380
Wil, um, can I talk
to you about something?
Of course.

10:48.414 --> 10:52.318
Right. Okay, um...

10:54.321 --> 10:57.190
you know how we
all make choices,

10:57.224 --> 10:59.225
and sometimes they're good,

10:59.259 --> 11:03.029
and sometimes
they're... less good.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.397
Uh-huh.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.701
Well, lately I haven't--
(door opens)

11:08.735 --> 11:10.602
Oh, Tara, hey--

11:12.438 --> 11:14.841
BUFFY:
Amy?
The whole school?

11:16.844 --> 11:21.148
By a giant snake thing?
Okay, still adjusting.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.183
-Hi, Buffy.
-Hi.

11:26.953 --> 11:30.490
-How've you been?
-Rat. You?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.359
-Dead.
-Oh.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.596
Well, I should let you guys
catch up. I can--

11:36.629 --> 11:40.366
No, no, no, no. Stay.
Do you have any cookies?

11:41.467 --> 11:43.336
Uh, yeah. Wh-what kind?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.905
Any kind. Not cheese.

11:45.938 --> 11:49.408
Um, sure.
In the-the kitchen.
I'll just get 'em.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.278
No, no.
I'll grab 'em.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.715
Okay, well, um, at least,
you know, let me make up
the couch for you.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.018
It's late.
You should stay here.
Everybody does.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.652
Thank you.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.494
Wow!
I know.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.197
Is she gonna be okay?

12:11.230 --> 12:16.469
Don't know.
She's kinda freaked out.
But then, I would be too.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.270
Wow.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.474
Yeah, I--
I just realized I could.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.144
Thought of
the right thing and--

12:24.177 --> 12:28.615
It's nice having another
magically-inclined
friend around.

12:31.683 --> 12:35.422
So, what were you
gonna tell me? You were
sounding all serious.

12:35.455 --> 12:39.625
Huh?
Oh, it's nothing.

12:39.658 --> 12:42.895
I mean, the whole
Amy-rat-Amy thing,

12:42.929 --> 12:44.831
no way I'm topping that.

12:47.835 --> 12:51.504
(man speaking on TV)

12:55.008 --> 12:59.145
Hey. How you doin'?
You need anything?
(TV shuts off)

12:59.178 --> 13:01.815
No, thanks.
Good cookies.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.788
-Sorry about your mom.
-Thanks.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.692
It's crazy, all the things
that have happened
since I went away.

13:12.725 --> 13:16.830
-No kidding.
-Snyder got eaten by a snake,

13:16.864 --> 13:18.831
the high school
got destroyed.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.768
Oh, Gatorade
has a new flavor. Blue.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.870
See? Head spinning.

13:26.505 --> 13:30.277
People getting frozen,
Willow's dating girls...

13:30.309 --> 13:32.511
and did you hear
about Tom and Nicole?

13:32.544 --> 13:35.381
-People are getting frozen?
-(TV on)

13:35.414 --> 13:39.719
In critical yet stable
condition as local authorities
continue their investigation

13:39.751 --> 13:42.855
into the robbery that left
one man frozen solid.

13:42.889 --> 13:47.860
-Live from the museum,
Brian Morris, K-OUS.
-Weird.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.596
(siren blaring)

13:56.202 --> 13:59.206
Oh. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Thanks.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.809
Anything can happen.
I'm not sure what it is.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.879
Careful.
(clinking)

14:05.913 --> 14:09.917
-Wait here, wait here.
-(chattering)

14:21.928 --> 14:27.167
-Great.
-Well, well, well, look who
decided to show up.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.536
What are you
doing here, Spike?

14:29.568 --> 14:34.173
Well, you know a man
was frozen alive in there.
A little compassion, love.

14:34.206 --> 14:38.745
Uh, you know, as long as
we're both here,
you might as well tag along.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.880
I mean, as a team we could--
Yeah, that never really
ends well, does it?

14:41.914 --> 14:43.917
It did
the other night.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.619
You really seem
awfully fixated on
a couple of kisses, Spike.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.889
And you seem awfully quick
to forget about 'em.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.428
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

14:56.462 --> 14:58.898
I'm-I'm sorry if you thought
that it meant more.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.967
But?

15:02.802 --> 15:05.871
But when I kissed you,

15:05.904 --> 15:08.075
you know I was thinking
about Giles, right?

15:08.107 --> 15:10.809
You know, I always wondered
about you two.

15:10.842 --> 15:12.544
What?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.081
Oh, gross, Spike!

15:16.448 --> 15:18.717
He left,
I was depressed,

15:18.750 --> 15:22.254
ergo, vulnerability
and bad kissing decisions.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.792
But that's all that it was.
You have to let it go.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.263
-Did it work?
-What?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.831
You convince yourself?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.668
Please stop.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.105
A man can change.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.875
You're not a man.
You're a thing.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.879
Stop walking away.
Don't touch me!

15:51.217 --> 15:53.786
(yelling)

16:00.460 --> 16:02.095
You're a thing.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.131
An evil, disgusting thing.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.721
Look at all the goodies.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.677
(screams)
That's right.
You should scream.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.515
Creature of the night
here, yeah?
Some people forget that.

16:56.548 --> 17:00.886
-Please.
-She thinks I'm housebroken.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.690
-She forgot who
she's dealing with.
-Anything you want--

17:03.722 --> 17:06.759
Just 'cause she's confused
about where she fits in,
I'm supposed to be too?

17:06.791 --> 17:08.661
'Cause I'm not.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.664
I know what I am.
I'm dangerous. I'm evil.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.401
I-I-I'm sure
you're not evil.

17:14.433 --> 17:18.171
Yes, I am.
I am a killer.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.606
That's what I do.
I kill.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.443
And, yeah, maybe it's been
a long time, but...

17:25.444 --> 17:26.613
it's not like
you forget how.

17:26.645 --> 17:33.220
You just do it,
and now I can again,
all right?

17:34.121 --> 17:35.322
So, here goes.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.094
(screams)
This might hurt a little.
(growls)

17:42.095 --> 17:43.563
(yells)

17:46.165 --> 17:50.436
(panting)
What the hell is going on?

17:55.775 --> 17:58.310
Good God,
that's a lot of shake.

17:58.345 --> 18:03.115
I mean, I know part of our big
movie and milk shake fun day,

18:03.150 --> 18:06.885
but, good God,
that's a lot of shake!

18:06.919 --> 18:09.888
Helps to wash down
the Raisinets.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.325
Promise me that you will
eat something green tonight.

18:12.358 --> 18:16.429
Leafy green,
not Gummi green.
(giggles)

18:17.630 --> 18:19.766
Movie was fun.

18:19.798 --> 18:23.068
Yeah. It was ironic
when all those
cute inner-city kids...

18:23.102 --> 18:25.070
taught their coach
a valuable lesson.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.407
You know that I will always
be there for you, right?

18:28.441 --> 18:32.845
There-There's actually
more of a lead-in when
I practiced that at home.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.817
I know.
It's just,

18:38.851 --> 18:41.488
I wanted you to know that...

18:41.520 --> 18:46.125
my moving out had nothing
to do with you, and I'm--
I will never stop loving you.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.528
I know.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.300
(sighs)
Do you think you'll
ever get back together?

18:54.334 --> 18:55.867
I wish I knew.

18:58.069 --> 19:01.173
But you still love her.
Very much. I just--

19:03.343 --> 19:07.046
Sometimes... other things
get in the way.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.648
I know.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.885
She's been doing
a lot better lately though.

19:13.920 --> 19:18.391
She's been really good
about being careful
a-about stuff.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.127
Well, good.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.864
Great.
That's-That's great.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.803
Here. Says the guard's
definitely gonna live.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.973
He's all thawed out. Says
they used hair dryers. Huh.

19:35.007 --> 19:39.412
Everything slowed down.
His nervous system,
circulatory system.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.749
-He's still unconscious.
-(whimpering)

19:42.781 --> 19:46.051
-Anya?
-It's such a pain.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.755
The text I wanted--
Giles took it with him.

19:48.788 --> 19:53.359
He has this thing that
owning a book makes it,
like, his property.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.329
What should we do?
Should we call him?

19:57.364 --> 20:00.500
It's like the middle
of last night there.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.369
Maybe it's tomorrow.
Anyone remember
how that works?

20:03.403 --> 20:07.073
It's okay. No one freak.
We'll just do it another way.

20:07.105 --> 20:10.977
I don't think we need to
resort to-- I mean--

20:13.078 --> 20:14.713
Oh. Hey. Cool.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.715
All right,
back to basics.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.184
A little old-fashioned,
state-of-the-art hacker action.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.221
That's great, Wil.
I haven't seen you
do that in a long time.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.760
I-I don't remember
that part.

20:28.795 --> 20:32.265
It's quicker.
It'll just take me a sec
to go through the files.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.768
Okay, internal police report.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.605
A diamond was stolen
from the museum last night.

20:38.637 --> 20:42.275
A big one, on loan
from the British Museum.

20:42.308 --> 20:45.677
They're withholding information
to smoke out the criminals.

20:46.813 --> 20:50.450
Oh, it's pretty.
There's a picture.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.052
Well, is it
a supernatural diamond?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.722
You know, like,
healing powers or--
or good-lucky?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.758
Maybe it's cursed.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.159
Diamonds are excellent
for cursing.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.095
We'll keep checking,
shall we?

21:03.128 --> 21:06.898
Well, you know,
I am kinda beat,

21:06.932 --> 21:11.637
and I bet you
that's tiring, that...
thing you're doing there.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.644
Guys, I'm fine.
What's the deal with--

21:17.676 --> 21:20.413
Oh, for crying out loud!
This is bizarre.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.982
You're all la-la-la
with the magic
and the not talking,

21:24.016 --> 21:26.853
like everything's normal,
when we all know that
Tara up and left you,

21:26.885 --> 21:28.387
and now everyone's scared
to say anything to you.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.191
Except me.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.827
Is this that thing I do
that you were commenting--
(whispers) Uh-huh.

21:35.862 --> 21:39.699
Guys, it's okay.
It's hard...

21:40.666 --> 21:42.000
but, it-it's better this way.

21:43.903 --> 21:49.107
Little things
just started taking over.
Things that didn't matter.

21:49.141 --> 21:53.945
But we saw them differently,
so they got blown out
of proportion.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.784
And this time away will
help us sort through things.

21:57.817 --> 22:02.888
Really. Now, let's
just keep working on this.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.525
I don't want to leave Amy
alone in the house so long.

22:05.557 --> 22:09.729
Amy. Is she--
How is she adjusting?

22:10.997 --> 22:12.398
It's hard to say.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.333
It's a lot to take in.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.803
I keep expecting her
to do, like, ratty stuff.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.005
You know,
licking her hands clean,

22:19.038 --> 22:22.409
shredding newspaper,
leaving little pellets
in the corner.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.612
Let's definitely not
leave her alone in
the house too long.

22:28.515 --> 22:32.018
-I didn't know
it'd be so sparkly.
-And so big.

22:32.050 --> 22:36.055
Yes, gentlemen, it turns out
size is everything.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.657
No offense, man.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.626
It makes colors
with the light.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.697
All right. I think
we've finished the first part.

22:44.730 --> 22:48.267
Now it's time for phase two.
Is the van fired up?
Check.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.045
Hello?
It's called knocking.

23:00.946 --> 23:04.416
Knock knock, robot boy.
You need to look at my chip.

23:04.451 --> 23:07.953
Is that, like, British
slang or something?
'Cause we're not--

23:07.987 --> 23:10.056
In my head.
The chip in my head.

23:10.088 --> 23:11.758
We're kind of in the middle
of something.

23:11.790 --> 23:15.126
Well, you can play holodeck
another time.
Right now, I'm in charge.

23:15.161 --> 23:19.365
Yeah, what are you gonna do
if we don't especially
feel like maybe playing your--

23:19.397 --> 23:22.201
What are-- wait,
what are you doing?

23:22.233 --> 23:27.606
Examine my chip or else Mr. Fett
here is the first to die.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.042
Hey! All-- All right.
Let's not-- Let's not
do anything crazy here.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.447
That's a limited edition,
1979, mint condition Boba Fett.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.415
WARREN:
All right, dude, chill.

23:37.450 --> 23:41.788
You can still make it right.
You know you don't
wanna do this.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.824
What I want
is answers, nimrod.

23:44.856 --> 23:47.926
Right. But you don't want
to hurt the Fett,

23:47.960 --> 23:50.962
because, man, you're not
comin' back from that!

23:50.997 --> 23:53.432
You know, you don't just
do that and walk away.

23:53.465 --> 23:56.702
-That right?
Let's find out.
-One sec-- One second.

23:58.805 --> 24:01.574
Dudes, I think that's Spike.
Of course it is,
and he's evil.

24:01.607 --> 24:05.076
Completely capable
of removing that head.
I'm gonna help him out.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.815
Are you sure we can trust him?
I mean, we all have heads too.

24:08.847 --> 24:11.817
See, we help him,
and he owes us one.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.520
See, we get Spike on our side,
we get info on Buffy.

24:14.554 --> 24:17.757
And maybe-- maybe we can
even find a way to keep her
out of phase two.

24:17.789 --> 24:22.094
-Jonathan's right.
Can we trust him?
-Of course not.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.329
But alliances
aren't about trust.

24:24.363 --> 24:27.599
See, he needs us,
we need him. Well, that's
how these things work.

24:27.634 --> 24:31.069
I think we're ready.
Agreed?
Agreed.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.374
Do what you
need to do.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.813
I think we can
work something out.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.950
I'll take a look at your chip.
It'll be a deal.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.518
We scratch your back,
you scratch--

24:45.551 --> 24:47.318
I'm not scratching
your anything.

24:47.353 --> 24:51.323
You do what I tell you.
That's the deal. Deal?

24:51.356 --> 24:53.660
-Deal.
-Then let's go.

24:56.895 --> 25:02.101
(gasps)
It's okay, it's okay.
It'll be fine.

25:08.240 --> 25:12.310
-Amy?
-Oh, God, you're back!

25:12.344 --> 25:14.380
I thought you said
you wouldn't be gone
that long.

25:14.413 --> 25:17.849
-I wasn't. I mean,
I thought I was--
-Let's go somewhere.

25:17.884 --> 25:21.688
-Don't you want to
go see your dad?
-No. Can't.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.356
Not yet.
Too many questions.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.425
About where you were?

25:27.459 --> 25:30.061
No. About how I got there.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.000
I wish there was a way that
I could make him forget
about the last three years.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.869
Oh, well, hey,
I can help you with that.

25:37.903 --> 25:43.576
Only you might want to
sew your name into your clothes
first or something.

25:43.609 --> 25:46.578
No. I just don't wanna
deal with him right now.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.781
I think
I would be... bored.

25:49.816 --> 25:53.219
-Well--
-Come on. Let's get
outta here.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.756
Well, what do you want to do?

25:57.757 --> 26:00.558
I don't know.
Something fun.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.662
Anything not involving
a big wheel.

26:03.996 --> 26:09.234
Or maybe... you'd rather
sit home all night,

26:09.268 --> 26:12.104
alone,
like in high school.

26:12.137 --> 26:17.409
No. No, you know what?
I can have fun.

26:17.442 --> 26:19.444
Heck, I-I deserve some fun.

26:19.478 --> 26:23.082
-Yeah, you do.
-I can party.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.685
Not like I owe anyone anything.
I am totally free.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.922
So, let's make with the fun.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.459
(beeping)

26:43.169 --> 26:44.804
You're English, right?

26:46.505 --> 26:48.173
Yeah?

26:48.207 --> 26:50.342
I've seen every episode
of Dr. Who.

26:51.978 --> 26:55.114
Not Red Dwar though,
'cause, um--

26:55.146 --> 26:57.348
'Cause it's
not out yet on DVD.

26:57.383 --> 27:00.819
Right. It's
not out yet on... DVD.

27:01.887 --> 27:04.656
-Warren!
-Here I am. Here.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.659
Bloody hell.
Get on with it, then.

27:08.493 --> 27:11.029
Help me out here, Spock.
I don't speak loser.

27:11.063 --> 27:15.166
Okay. Right.
Well, um, your chip
works fine. Yeah.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.839
-There's gotta be
something wrong--
-No, no, listen.

27:20.873 --> 27:24.777
I don't know what
that thing does.
I'd like to.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.645
-Hey.
-But whatever it is,
it works fine.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.381
There's no deterioration
of the signal. It still is
coming through

27:29.414 --> 27:32.417
in a steady pulse,
which it's supposed to.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.490
If you're lying to me--
No. It's all right here.

27:38.523 --> 27:42.560
I mean, it is. It's really
not that hard to figure out
if you just-- What?

27:47.566 --> 27:50.301
You tell anyone
about this--
I won't. I-I promise.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.005
Who would I tell?
I don't even know
what this is about.

27:53.038 --> 27:55.974
It's about the rules
having changed.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.509
Everything's different now.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.549
Nothing wrong with me.
Something wrong with her.

28:11.123 --> 28:14.226
Hello? We're home.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.261
Looks like
no one's here.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.497
Well, I'm sure
they'll be back soon.

28:18.529 --> 28:22.034
Um, I know Willow and Buffy
were meeting up with Xander
to do some research.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.569
Well, then I-I should
probably get back.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.506
Or you can stay
and wait for them.

28:27.538 --> 28:31.343
Then you can get a chance to
catch up with... everyone.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.579
Yeah, I-I don't think
that's such a great idea.

28:34.613 --> 28:37.249
Okay. Your call.

28:37.282 --> 28:40.719
I have the TV
to keep me company
till they get back.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.721
(TV on)

28:43.756 --> 28:46.424
You notice how
it's been getting dark
so much earlier these days?

28:48.394 --> 28:51.596
Ha. Talking cat.

28:53.598 --> 28:57.135
Fine. I'll stay,
but just until
they get back.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.703
And only to make sure
that you are not alone.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.340
This has nothing to do
with... anyone else.

29:03.308 --> 29:06.846
Sure. Cool.
Up to you.

29:11.282 --> 29:15.821
* Low country wars

29:15.855 --> 29:17.890
* Oh, there's a demon

29:17.923 --> 29:21.126
* She's drinkin' and thinkin'
and runnin' away *

29:21.160 --> 29:23.962
I know. Xander engaged.
I couldn't believe it either.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.833
It's just so weird.

29:28.666 --> 29:31.237
So, what's she like?

29:31.269 --> 29:35.240
A thousand-year-old
capitalist ex-demon
with rabbit phobia.

29:35.273 --> 29:40.846
Well, that's so his type.
* I'm losing or am I winning?

29:40.880 --> 29:44.615
* I'm getting caught
in the corners *

29:44.650 --> 29:46.417
* Of her vermilion borders

29:46.451 --> 29:49.320
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.689
* She's moving backwards
and forwards *

29:50.721 --> 29:52.023
Hey.

29:52.057 --> 29:55.161
* And she's ugly
when she's insecure *

29:55.193 --> 29:59.097
-* That makes her beautiful
-Well, let's go, then.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.133
We're gonna go dance.
Do you wanna come?

30:01.166 --> 30:04.002
Oh, uh, no. You go.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.505
-I-I'll keep an eye
on our drinks.
-Okay.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.008
I mean, because if
you want something
a little more your style--

30:12.310 --> 30:14.413
I'm sure we can swing that.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.183
No. Really. No.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.693
Hi. Brie.
Willow.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.897
Nice, um, top.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.833
-No. Thanks, but no.
-Are you sure?

30:37.169 --> 30:39.939
-I'm not-- Sh-sh-- I'm still--
-It's cool.

30:42.273 --> 30:44.911
Oh. Uh, sorry.

30:47.212 --> 30:52.218
-MAN:
So, uh, are we gonna go?
-Yes. You're gonna be okay?

30:52.250 --> 30:54.752
Yeah, go. I'm
all kinds of good.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.822
* I'm losing

30:56.855 --> 31:00.826
* Or am I winning?

31:00.858 --> 31:03.862
* I'm getting caught
in the corners *

31:03.895 --> 31:07.566
* Of her vermilion borders

31:07.598 --> 31:10.001
* She's moving backwards
and forwards *

31:10.036 --> 31:12.770
* And she's ugly
when she's inse-- *

31:18.710 --> 31:20.778
No use looking at me
like that.

31:20.811 --> 31:22.647
It's the gullet
for you, mister.

31:25.416 --> 31:28.319
Hey. Sorry. I kind of
got caught up.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.388
No. It's okay.

31:32.959 --> 31:36.095
You know,
if rats could dance,

31:36.127 --> 31:37.997
they probably
wouldn't gnaw so much.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.934
Hey, come on.
We're just
gettin' started.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.305
I think I'm gonna
sit this one out.
MAN: Uh-uh.

31:46.337 --> 31:49.208
You can't just work us up
like that and then just--
Hey!

31:49.240 --> 31:53.845
-I think she said no.
-Well, nobody
asked you, Ellen.

31:58.616 --> 32:01.252
-You wanna dance?
-That's all.

32:01.287 --> 32:04.155
Nice, slow,
relaxing dance.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.603
Gee.
I think I do
feel more relaxed.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.939
XANDER:
Aha! I got it!

32:20.972 --> 32:22.340
Here's our villain
right here.

32:25.711 --> 32:26.979
What?

32:27.012 --> 32:29.315
That's a D&D manual,
sweetie.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.782
No, but it--

32:34.452 --> 32:36.622
-Oh.
-Let's face it.

32:36.654 --> 32:39.090
We're not gonna find this thing
because it doesn't exist.

32:39.125 --> 32:42.594
There's no such thing
as a frost monster
who eats diamonds.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.131
Well, maybe
he doesn't eat them.

32:45.163 --> 32:48.000
You know, maybe he just...
thinks they're pretty.

32:51.136 --> 32:55.040
-We suck.
-We need new brains.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.376
-What's up with Willow?
-Out with Amy, I guess.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.979
Great. Someone to do
more magic with.

33:01.012 --> 33:05.951
But at least she's not
all cooped up and crying.
That's forward momentum.

33:05.983 --> 33:09.188
I know that I don't know
everything that happened
with her and Tara, but it--

33:09.221 --> 33:13.625
Tara thinks Willow is
doing too much magic,
and she's not the only one.

33:13.659 --> 33:17.296
I know. But I think she'll
be fine, you know?

33:17.328 --> 33:20.132
It's-- It's Willow,
she of the level head.

33:20.165 --> 33:24.303
Well, those are the ones you
have to watch out for the most.
Responsible types.

33:24.336 --> 33:28.074
Right. She might
go crazy and start
alphabetizing everything.

33:28.106 --> 33:31.910
I'm serious.
Responsible people
are always so concerned

33:31.942 --> 33:35.213
with being good all the time
that when they finally
get a taste of being bad,

33:35.247 --> 33:38.849
they can't get enough--
It's like all kablooey.

33:38.884 --> 33:42.688
-That's not true.
-Okay, not kablooey.
More like bam!

33:42.721 --> 33:45.356
It's human nature, Buff.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.660
Wil's getting a taste of
something powerful,
way bigger than her.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.863
Yeah, and she was getting
out of control with it
before Tara left,

33:51.896 --> 33:56.234
-and now that she's gone--
-XANDER: It's gotta be seductive
just giving in to it,

33:56.268 --> 33:57.969
going totally wild.

33:59.570 --> 34:02.240
-We need to keep
an eye on her.
-Okay.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.509
Okay. We'll--
we'll keep an eye.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.413
But we can't assume that
everybody's getting seduced.
You know, sometimes--

34:07.445 --> 34:10.148
(phone rings)

34:14.119 --> 34:17.289
-Hello, Magic Box.
-Slayer.

34:17.322 --> 34:21.693
-Spike?
-Meet me at the cemetery.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.795
Twenty minutes.
Come alone.

34:25.896 --> 34:28.567
-Spike?
-(sighs)

34:28.599 --> 34:31.202
Bloody hell.
Yes, it's me.

34:31.237 --> 34:35.806
-You're calling me
on the phone?
-Just be there.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.143
Why, are you
helping again?

34:39.177 --> 34:41.480
You have a lead on
this frost monster thingie?

34:41.512 --> 34:43.815
Something like that, yeah.

34:43.849 --> 34:46.117
Thought you might be up
for a little grunt work.

34:46.152 --> 34:49.655
What? No.
No-No grunting.

34:51.822 --> 34:56.561
I was talking shop, love,
but if you got other
ideas, you, me,

34:56.594 --> 34:58.130
cozy little
tomb with a view--

35:04.101 --> 35:06.637
So, what did
Captain Peroxide want?

35:06.672 --> 35:10.007
Nothing. He just, you know,
wanted to see if I--

35:10.041 --> 35:13.445
I wanted to patrol for
the-the monster.

35:13.478 --> 35:16.215
But I-I told him
that I... would not.

35:19.985 --> 35:23.355
BUFFY: I'm telling you.
I think there's something
about this thing.

35:23.389 --> 35:26.492
I don't know, Buff.
It seems like we've
been through every book.

35:26.525 --> 35:29.494
Yeah, even the ones
that weren't so boring
you wanted to kill yourself.

35:29.527 --> 35:33.199
We have those?
I'm just saying, all the things
that have happened lately--

35:33.231 --> 35:36.335
Okay, the--
the bank robbery,
the jewelry heist.

35:36.367 --> 35:40.206
-Exploding lint.
-Is it me or do these
things seem really--

35:40.239 --> 35:41.206
Lame?

35:43.141 --> 35:45.210
Well, I was gonna go
with unusual, but yeah.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.146
I don't know.
I'll do a quick
patrol tonight,

35:49.181 --> 35:51.682
and after a good night's sleep,
we can solve this tomorrow.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.119
Optimism.
I remember optimism.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.789
-That's because you're
like a thousand.
-Good night, guys.

35:57.822 --> 35:58.824
Night.
Night.

36:04.695 --> 36:05.831
Slayer.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.233
And so my night
is now complete.

36:08.266 --> 36:12.438
You never showed.
Sorry. Little busy
actually doing stuff.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.572
You shouldn't
be so flip, love.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.407
What are you gonna do,
walk behind me to death?

36:16.442 --> 36:18.277
I'm just saying things
might be a little different.

36:19.945 --> 36:23.114
You ought to be careful.
Enough.

36:26.251 --> 36:29.588
Get out of my way.
Or what?

36:40.266 --> 36:44.235
(panting)
Oh, the pain, the pain...

36:44.269 --> 36:46.204
is gone.

36:47.405 --> 36:50.442
Guess what
I just found out.

36:50.476 --> 36:53.043
Looks like I'm not as toothless
as you thought, sweetheart.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.746
How?

36:55.780 --> 36:59.885
Don't you get it?
Don't you see?

36:59.918 --> 37:02.387
You came back wrong.

37:20.838 --> 37:24.074
It's a trick.
You did something to
the chip. It's a trick.

37:24.108 --> 37:26.945
It's no trick.
It's not me. It's you.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.481
Just you, in fact.
That's the funny part.
You're the one that's changed.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.918
That's why
this doesn't hurt me.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.954
Came back a little
less human than you were.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.358
You're wrong.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.963
Then how come
you're so spooked, love?
And why can I--

37:45.996 --> 37:46.998
do that?

37:52.003 --> 37:53.038
You're wrong.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.454
* What is wrong here?

38:08.487 --> 38:10.956
* What is
wrong here? *

38:10.989 --> 38:15.860
* What is wrong with you?

38:15.893 --> 38:18.530
* What is wrong here?

38:18.563 --> 38:20.831
* What is
wrong here? *

38:20.865 --> 38:23.869
* Where is your head?

38:23.902 --> 38:26.070
You know, this music
isn't quite--

38:29.239 --> 38:33.644
* Because I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone *

38:33.679 --> 38:35.646
* No, no, no
* I don't wanna go

38:35.681 --> 38:39.784
* I don't wanna
go it alo-o-one *
 * Alo-o-one

38:39.818 --> 38:45.056
* Every time
I see you, I can't find
the words to say *

38:45.090 --> 38:50.829
* I just wanna turn
and run away *

38:50.862 --> 38:53.465
* I can't find
the time or place *

38:53.498 --> 38:56.166
* To say what
I need to sa-a-ay *

38:56.201 --> 39:01.572
* I just wanna run away

39:01.606 --> 39:05.010
* I just wanna run

39:19.791 --> 39:23.628
(chuckling)
Oh, poor,
little, lost girl.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.269
She doesn't fit in anywhere.
She's got no one to love.

39:36.942 --> 39:40.711
Me? I'm lost?
Look at you, you idiot.

39:40.746 --> 39:44.583
Poor Spikey.
Can't be a human,
can't be a vampire.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.585
Where the hell
do you fit in?

39:52.322 --> 39:54.259
Your job is
to kill the Slayer,

39:54.291 --> 39:57.262
but all you can do is
follow me around
making moon eyes.

39:57.295 --> 40:00.532
-I'm in love with you.
-You're in love with pain.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.268
Admit it. You like me

40:03.300 --> 40:05.603
because you enjoy
getting beat down.

40:05.637 --> 40:09.440
So really,
who's screwed up?
Hello. Vampire.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.411
I'm supposed to be
treading on the dark side.

40:22.119 --> 40:24.289
What's your excuse?

40:32.664 --> 40:35.132
* I can't find the time
and place *

40:35.166 --> 40:37.902
* To say what
I need to sa-a-ay *

40:37.936 --> 40:40.005
* I just wanna run away

40:40.038 --> 40:42.039
So we've kind of
played this scene.

40:43.273 --> 40:46.311
Yeah.
Return.

40:46.344 --> 40:51.617
* What is wrong with you?

40:51.650 --> 40:54.018
* What is wrong here?

40:54.052 --> 40:59.891
I-- I just keep thinking
there's gotta be someplace,
like, bigger than this.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.630
Besides, it's way too early
to go home yet.

41:11.168 --> 41:13.605
I wasn't planning
on hurting you... much.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.806
You haven't even come
close to hurting me.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.141
Afraid to give me
the chance?

41:22.648 --> 41:24.181
You afraid I'm gonna--

41:49.740 --> 41:51.543
(zipper unzipping)

42:01.418 --> 42:04.856
(grunting)

42:13.965 --> 42:16.568
(inaudible)

43:11.356 --> 43:13.759
Grr! Arrgh!
