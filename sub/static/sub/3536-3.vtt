WEBVTT

00:01.413 --> 00:03.502
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:03.655 --> 00:05.877
for the murders of 14 young women.

00:05.978 --> 00:07.299
We need you in Virginia, Ryan.

00:07.423 --> 00:08.683
I'm not an agent anymore.

00:08.781 --> 00:10.940
You caught Carroll.
No one knows him like you do.

00:11.119 --> 00:12.736
So what's my sequel about, Joe?

00:12.893 --> 00:14.860
We're gonna write this together, Ryan.

00:15.302 --> 00:16.133
Ohh!

00:16.728 --> 00:19.314
Even though you slept with my wife.

00:19.413 --> 00:22.910
I have so many surprises
waiting for you.

00:23.676 --> 00:25.350
He fancies himself Edgar Allan Poe.

00:25.449 --> 00:26.891
That was the impetus
for writing his novel.

00:27.077 --> 00:28.210
We got more bodies.

00:28.316 --> 00:30.316
He removed the eyes,
Carroll's signature.

00:30.439 --> 00:32.857
He used this prison guard
to gain access to the internet

00:33.001 --> 00:33.965
to create a cult.

00:34.182 --> 00:35.734
Agent Parker's taking the lead.

00:35.919 --> 00:37.880
Cults, my specialty.

00:37.999 --> 00:39.745
Ice pick lady, gay neighbors,

00:39.872 --> 00:43.402
and the nanny, how do they
figure into your new plot?

00:43.521 --> 00:45.821
Where is he? Joey?
Where is my son?!

00:46.117 --> 00:47.730
Carroll knows where the kid is.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.834
He's not gonna tell us.

00:48.955 --> 00:50.181
He might tell his wife.

00:50.874 --> 00:53.558
You son of a bitch, where's my son?

00:55.948 --> 00:58.301
"Take thy beak from out of my heart,

00:58.421 --> 01:01.025
and take thy form
from off my door."

01:01.226 --> 01:04.125
Quoth the raven "nevermore."

01:04.370 --> 01:07.629
And the raven, never flitting,
still is sitting,

01:07.764 --> 01:08.980
still is sitting...

01:09.097 --> 01:10.002
If you don't like the piece,

01:10.115 --> 01:11.712
call my editor, scream at him.

01:11.919 --> 01:15.242
It is too early for this crap.

01:15.348 --> 01:16.537
You have a nice day.

01:16.887 --> 01:18.354
Lies floating on the floor

01:18.491 --> 01:22.170
shall be lifted--
nevermore!

02:10.684 --> 02:12.149
Good morning, Claire.

02:13.854 --> 02:15.087
Aah!

02:23.956 --> 02:25.059
Good morning, ma'am.

02:25.176 --> 02:26.586
Is Ryan Hardy here?

02:26.697 --> 02:29.604
No, ma'am.
He left over an hour ago.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.152
How'd you sleep?
That motel they stuck us in sucks.

02:46.273 --> 02:47.203
The bed is bricks.

02:47.321 --> 02:48.249
How many fingerprints?

02:48.349 --> 02:51.297
9 in total.
Several were older prints,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.596
but upstairs in the attic room,

02:53.693 --> 02:55.715
that is where we found 6 sets.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.131
They're the newest ones we found.

02:57.298 --> 03:00.107
I'm guessing that's where
they gathered most.

03:00.218 --> 03:03.847
4 of the sets belong to Emma,
Jacob, Paul, and Jordy.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.292
Yeah. That's 4. The guy with
the Poe mask that attacked me.

03:07.413 --> 03:08.137
5.

03:08.251 --> 03:11.058
You really think that this
cult is limited to 6 people?

03:11.985 --> 03:14.563
We weren't supposed to find
their little clubhouse.

03:15.143 --> 03:17.043
I tell you, there's
got to be something here

03:17.168 --> 03:19.084
that will tell us
where Joey Matthews is.

03:19.216 --> 03:21.166
Uh-uh. I've been
through every piece of it.

03:21.292 --> 03:24.155
Nothing points to where he
is or why they took him.

03:24.428 --> 03:26.504
I want to understand
what this cult is about.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.181
I mean, what's Carroll's message?

03:28.332 --> 03:31.051
Koresh, Jones, Manson--
they all used mind control

03:31.183 --> 03:34.048
to reinforce their message of family
and unity over the individual.

03:34.159 --> 03:35.566
Didn't Manson convince
his family to kill

03:35.672 --> 03:37.114
for his own selfish needs?

03:37.229 --> 03:39.779
Yeah, but he dressed it up in
several different motives at once.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.968
He'd test his followers

03:42.085 --> 03:44.714
with acts of murder in order
to prove their devotion.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.437
He was a brilliant manipulator,

03:46.580 --> 03:48.597
get anyone to do anything.

03:49.893 --> 03:51.510
Joe was a teacher.

03:51.846 --> 03:52.937
He was a man of ideas,

03:53.084 --> 03:54.598
and he was brilliant at it.

03:54.844 --> 03:55.893
I witnessed him at class

03:56.033 --> 03:59.077
he could engage
and inspire his students

03:59.204 --> 04:01.779
in ways that I'd never seen before.

04:02.883 --> 04:06.441
Hester had
broken free from all of that.

04:06.553 --> 04:11.177
She had-- she had created
her own moral code.

04:11.560 --> 04:18.084
Are we not able to break free
and-- and do whatever we want

04:18.874 --> 04:23.017
as long as we are willing
to pay life's consequences?

04:23.755 --> 04:27.543
What is-- what is
your moral code?

04:28.427 --> 04:32.497
Make it unique unto yourself,

04:32.691 --> 04:36.308
and it will bleed into your writing.

04:39.002 --> 04:40.099
Yeah.

04:41.132 --> 04:42.332
Thank you.

04:43.014 --> 04:44.463
How's your bedside manner?

04:44.572 --> 04:45.612
Jordy's awake.

04:47.365 --> 04:49.346
Hey, Jordy.
How you feeling?

04:49.460 --> 04:51.253
How am I feeling?
You shot me.

04:51.368 --> 04:52.700
Yeah. Sorry about that.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.149
Tell us where Joey Matthews is.

04:56.237 --> 04:57.891
Oh, is that all?

04:58.341 --> 04:59.880
Do you think I'm stupid?

05:00.681 --> 05:01.827
I'm not talking.

05:01.952 --> 05:03.973
I think you're looking
at the death penalty.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.174
I'll never make it to the chair.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.810
I'm a correctional officer.

05:07.931 --> 05:10.033
I won't last a week in prison,

05:11.085 --> 05:13.351
but can I tell you a little secret?

05:14.383 --> 05:16.876
It was worth it

05:17.158 --> 05:19.336
to kill those girls,

05:19.986 --> 05:22.789
to hold them in my
hands while they died,

05:22.928 --> 05:24.327
felt their last breath.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.056
You know I talked to Joe, right?

05:26.569 --> 05:29.774
He was very upset to find out
that you were still alive.

05:29.911 --> 05:31.343
He wanted you dead.
You failed.

05:31.507 --> 05:32.745
You were supposed to
kill Claire Matthews.

05:32.873 --> 05:34.507
Weren't those the rules?

05:37.010 --> 05:39.281
I know what you're doing.

05:39.515 --> 05:40.865
It's not gonna work.

05:40.993 --> 05:42.432
Come on, Jordy.

05:42.626 --> 05:44.012
Where's Joey?

05:45.884 --> 05:47.592
♪ La la la ♪

05:47.727 --> 05:49.262
I can't hear you.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.533
♪ Look at what's happened to me ♪

05:51.669 --> 05:52.886
Come on. Just tell
us where--

05:52.998 --> 05:54.735
♪ I can't believe it myself ♪

05:54.880 --> 05:58.218
♪ suddenly I'm up on top of the world ♪

05:58.328 --> 06:00.018
Jordy! Jordy!

06:00.448 --> 06:01.388
♪ Should have been somebody else ♪

06:01.494 --> 06:02.540
Aah!

06:02.649 --> 06:04.928
- Hey! - Sorry. I slipped.
- You can't do that!

06:05.120 --> 06:07.633
You can't do that!

06:07.760 --> 06:09.795
Hey! Hey!
No, no, no, no!

06:10.063 --> 06:11.031
Sorry for the shaky cam.

06:11.146 --> 06:12.825
- It's from a witness' cell.
- What are we watching?

06:12.966 --> 06:14.335
Street performance
by a man dressed as Poe

06:14.451 --> 06:15.340
early this morning.

06:15.457 --> 06:16.484
Recognize the mask?

06:17.287 --> 06:18.579
He was doing this on the street?

06:18.684 --> 06:20.639
It's very common.
It's the historical district,

06:20.853 --> 06:22.782
and here it comes.

06:26.582 --> 06:28.721
Hey. Wait.
Who's the victim?

06:28.837 --> 06:30.922
Stan Fellows, book critic.

06:31.038 --> 06:33.459
Yeah. Richmond paper.
I know this guy.

06:33.603 --> 06:34.690
I interviewed him for my book.

06:34.809 --> 06:36.574
He wrote a scathing review

06:36.702 --> 06:38.229
of Carroll's book
"The Gothic Sea."

06:38.340 --> 06:39.121
It was the worst I read.

06:39.237 --> 06:41.066
Suspect threw confetti on the crowd.

06:41.373 --> 06:42.266
It's got writing on it.

06:42.373 --> 06:44.263
"Generous Critic
fann'd the Poet's fire,

06:44.386 --> 06:46.220
and taught the world
with reason to admire."

06:46.327 --> 06:47.192
That's Poe.

06:47.327 --> 06:48.578
So Carroll wants his followers

06:48.701 --> 06:50.510
to exact revenge on his critics?

06:50.930 --> 06:52.330
That could take a while.

06:53.051 --> 06:54.115
The recent string of murders

06:54.240 --> 06:55.988
in the wake of Joe Carroll's
prison escape

06:56.104 --> 06:58.285
is raising all kinds of speculation.

06:58.456 --> 07:00.937
Is this the work of a cult?

07:00.964 --> 07:04.595
Hey. The press is
officially calling us a cult,

07:04.708 --> 07:05.970
but the FBI won't confirm it,

07:06.100 --> 07:08.043
so they've issued a media blackout.

07:08.159 --> 07:10.174
That's because they're
completely clueless.

07:10.372 --> 07:11.723
Have you talked to Emma?

07:11.885 --> 07:13.234
No. No. Why?

07:14.137 --> 07:15.945
Things are weird between you guys,

07:16.315 --> 07:20.460
and to be fair, you haven't
been that nice to her.

07:21.988 --> 07:24.862
Oh. Is that Rick?
Awesome!

07:25.231 --> 07:27.184
Look. Here's some
cool footage of the fire.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.477
So-- so torch man's
a hit, huh?

07:31.062 --> 07:33.121
I knew it would work.

07:33.979 --> 07:36.157
If you hate blood so
much, what about fire?

07:36.267 --> 07:37.269
It's flashy.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.817
I don't hate blood.

07:39.984 --> 07:41.880
What about removing the eyes?

07:42.019 --> 07:43.612
You can't do that with fire.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.378
Actually you can, doofus.

07:46.535 --> 07:49.283
What Jordy means is the
eyes are Joe's signature.

07:49.676 --> 07:52.095
Fire doesn't go with gouging eyes.

07:52.207 --> 07:53.195
You're being literal.

07:53.311 --> 07:55.603
Besides, we're supposed
to find our own voice,

07:55.782 --> 07:59.420
not just copy Joe's story, doofus deux.

07:59.543 --> 08:00.892
I like Joe's story.

08:00.995 --> 08:02.401
Then have at it, Jordy.

08:02.509 --> 08:04.432
You do it your way, I'll do it mine.

08:08.292 --> 08:10.373
Just talk to Emma, okay?

08:10.468 --> 08:12.018
You don't see it, do you?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.963
I mean, that girl wears a lot of faces.

08:15.275 --> 08:17.294
I don't get the Emma you get.

08:17.388 --> 08:19.099
What Emma is that, Paul?

08:19.771 --> 08:21.098
Oh, we were just
talking--

08:21.202 --> 08:22.724
Don't cover for him.

08:23.059 --> 08:24.876
If he has something to say...

08:28.178 --> 08:29.664
Forget it.

08:41.893 --> 08:43.181
Hey, guys. We got him.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.295
There's a business owner
downtown with a security camera

08:45.415 --> 08:46.725
in an alley two blocks away.

08:46.848 --> 08:48.040
Can you get a license plate?

08:48.390 --> 08:49.409
Way ahead.

08:49.523 --> 08:50.980
Car's registered to...

08:51.091 --> 08:52.854
Rick Kester. He's 29.

08:53.015 --> 08:54.333
120 Churchill.

09:19.033 --> 09:20.383
This room is clear.

09:21.143 --> 09:21.955
Clear.

09:22.053 --> 09:23.163
Hey.

09:42.274 --> 09:43.545
Aah!

09:43.715 --> 09:46.319
Please don't hurt me.

09:46.496 --> 09:47.749
We're not gonna hurt you.

09:47.934 --> 09:48.913
Who are you?

09:49.194 --> 09:50.802
Maggie Kester.
I live here.

09:50.930 --> 09:53.779
- You know Rick Kester?
- Yes, I do. He's my husband.

09:59.757 --> 10:01.744
Thank you for agreeing
to come down and talk to us.

10:01.844 --> 10:03.981
Are you kidding?
I don't want to stay in that house alone.

10:04.095 --> 10:05.940
When was the last time you
heard from your husband?

10:06.109 --> 10:07.597
Last night.

10:07.894 --> 10:10.953
He... called.
I didn't pick up.

10:11.807 --> 10:13.403
We're separated.

10:14.692 --> 10:16.413
6 months now.

10:16.828 --> 10:17.773
Um...

10:19.073 --> 10:22.491
7:15. He didn't
leave a message.

10:22.751 --> 10:23.932
Why were you hiding from us?

10:24.053 --> 10:25.722
I didn't know it was you.
I was scared.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.044
He still has a key,

10:29.191 --> 10:31.470
and he's been bothering me, calling me,

10:31.588 --> 10:32.915
showing up at work.

10:33.029 --> 10:37.683
Rick can be... scary
when he wants to be.

10:37.807 --> 10:41.326
We pulled your records,
and your story checks out,

10:41.447 --> 10:44.702
but I'm curious
about this police report

10:44.824 --> 10:47.573
that you filled out
a couple of years back

10:47.686 --> 10:49.483
in the Emergency Room.

10:50.934 --> 10:53.525
Why did your husband try to kill you?

10:58.441 --> 11:00.721
I asked him for a divorce.

11:00.843 --> 11:02.532
So he took a knife to you?

11:06.248 --> 11:07.390
Unh!

11:08.190 --> 11:09.238
Ugh!

11:20.049 --> 11:21.470
They never pressed charges.

11:21.607 --> 11:24.240
I wouldn't testify
because he was sorry.

11:24.355 --> 11:28.058
He was. He wasn't...
always like this.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.354
When did you notice a change?

11:29.498 --> 11:31.401
He lost his job
and had all this free time

11:31.606 --> 11:35.219
and started hanging out
with these new friends.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.303
Did you ever meet any of them?

11:36.418 --> 11:38.348
No. I didn't want
anything to do with them.

11:38.459 --> 11:40.050
He would come home
with these weird ideas

11:40.204 --> 11:42.113
and saying crazy things.

11:42.227 --> 11:43.134
What things?

11:43.264 --> 11:44.579
He started talking a lot about death,

11:44.720 --> 11:46.819
how life didn't matter.

11:46.952 --> 11:50.001
He got really dark.
He was depressed.

11:54.723 --> 11:56.220
We're gonna give you protection

11:56.332 --> 11:57.827
till we find your husband.

11:58.278 --> 11:59.273
Excuse me.

12:05.153 --> 12:06.473
So you believe her?

12:06.593 --> 12:09.030
Yeah, I do.
She's tragic and pathetic,

12:09.146 --> 12:10.411
and I know her well.

12:10.527 --> 12:11.476
How so?

12:11.589 --> 12:12.725
She wants the man in her head,

12:12.828 --> 12:14.012
not the one she married.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.302
She's my mother,
my sister, my other sister.

12:16.906 --> 12:19.530
No one ever wants to see
what's really there.

12:20.264 --> 12:21.279
We need to find the husband.

12:21.398 --> 12:23.744
He's the closest thing
we have to finding Joey.

12:24.095 --> 12:25.107
Why don't you let me see Joe again,

12:25.218 --> 12:26.605
see if I can get him to talk?

12:26.738 --> 12:27.992
Let me try.

12:28.153 --> 12:30.449
I think it's time Joe and I met anyway.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.089
What do you want, Paul?

12:44.043 --> 12:45.635
You need any help?

12:46.055 --> 12:47.198
No.

12:49.555 --> 12:50.984
Look. I'm sorry

12:52.105 --> 12:54.615
about before and whatever I've done.

12:54.722 --> 12:55.836
We're all in this together,

12:55.945 --> 12:58.004
and I don't want things
to be like this.

12:59.225 --> 13:00.658
I don't either, Paul.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.675
Can we sort of pretend
that we like each other

13:04.059 --> 13:06.531
and, I don't know, see where that goes?

13:10.583 --> 13:12.107
Truce?

13:15.553 --> 13:17.447
Unh! You bitch!

13:17.584 --> 13:19.696
Don't try to turn Jacob against me.

13:20.045 --> 13:21.406
It won't work.

13:26.547 --> 13:28.325
Bitch!

13:30.042 --> 13:32.702
Hi. I'm Agent Parker.

13:33.015 --> 13:34.368
We haven't officially met.

13:34.674 --> 13:35.817
How's your hand?

13:38.726 --> 13:41.611
First of all, awesome job.

13:41.766 --> 13:43.062
I'm very impressed.

13:43.288 --> 13:45.811
How much planning did all of this take?

13:46.092 --> 13:49.191
Seriously, you are doing a great job.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.266
Thank you for my book.

13:54.578 --> 13:56.112
You're welcome.

13:59.303 --> 14:01.382
Why torch your critics?

14:01.482 --> 14:03.192
That seems a little petty.

14:03.299 --> 14:06.966
Oh, dear. Has someone been
playing with matches?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.674
I like fire, sir.

14:09.769 --> 14:11.998
It started when I was a
kid, and it just stuck.

14:12.134 --> 14:13.402
I'm not good at knives.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.434
I've been practicing getting better,

14:15.607 --> 14:17.729
but I still prefer fire.

14:18.104 --> 14:20.573
Definitely makes a statement.

14:21.524 --> 14:23.059
Tell me more.

14:23.343 --> 14:25.615
Poe often wrote of revenge.

14:25.752 --> 14:29.013
I want my chapter to be about revenge.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.696
I want to target the people
who hurt you professionally.

14:34.616 --> 14:37.094
I've done my research.
I know who they are.

14:38.469 --> 14:40.968
I'm not above revenge, Agent.

14:41.095 --> 14:42.331
I think I've proved that.

14:42.746 --> 14:45.523
Revenge is primal.
It's a universal theme,

14:45.643 --> 14:47.699
and every good story needs one.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.489
Don't you agree, Ryan?

14:51.365 --> 14:55.452
Of course, his theme...
somewhat different.

14:55.611 --> 14:58.695
So your acolytes come up
with ways to make you proud

14:58.827 --> 15:00.687
with these little tributes.

15:00.829 --> 15:02.321
Is that the way they're
helping you write your book?

15:02.439 --> 15:06.417
Right. Everyone has
a story to tell, Agent.

15:07.211 --> 15:11.418
Your little devotee, is he
gonna torch all your critics?

15:11.548 --> 15:14.372
There are really only 3 people
that I hold accountable

15:14.526 --> 15:17.618
for my professional downfall, Agent.

15:17.771 --> 15:20.057
Isn't that right, Ryan?

15:21.351 --> 15:24.056
I wonder who he holds accountable...

15:24.187 --> 15:26.613
for his downfall.

15:26.762 --> 15:28.572
Must be very hard for you

15:29.093 --> 15:34.233
to be surrounded by the
stench of death again.

15:35.181 --> 15:39.617
I know this takes
a terrible toll on you,

15:39.932 --> 15:42.153
and you must be careful,

15:43.334 --> 15:44.982
what with that...

15:45.602 --> 15:48.095
little heart of yours.

15:59.087 --> 16:00.214
What are you doing?

16:00.359 --> 16:04.022
3 people responsible for
Joe's downfall-- his words.

16:04.128 --> 16:06.543
That would be me, the dead critic,

16:06.951 --> 16:08.397
and this guy.

16:08.517 --> 16:10.653
He was a professor at the university.

16:10.764 --> 16:12.138
I interviewed him.
He was a dean.

16:12.296 --> 16:14.760
After Joe's book failed,
this guy denied him tenure,

16:14.896 --> 16:16.156
said that Joe wasn't worthy.

16:16.269 --> 16:17.456
It was a big blow to Joe's career.

16:17.568 --> 16:20.516
Here it is.
Phillip Barnes, Dean of Literature.

16:20.621 --> 16:21.959
Do you think he's still the dean?

16:22.173 --> 16:25.092
As far as I know.
This was years ago.

16:35.149 --> 16:36.721
May I help you?

16:37.076 --> 16:38.567
Did we have an appointment?

16:39.401 --> 16:42.169
Why did you deny Joe Carroll tenure?

16:43.911 --> 16:44.961
I beg your pardon.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.121
I asked you a question.

16:46.244 --> 16:47.526
Is this a joke?

16:48.617 --> 16:49.907
I'm sorry.
You need to leave.

16:50.019 --> 16:51.397
Ooh!

16:51.660 --> 16:53.399
No. You need to sit.

16:54.751 --> 16:56.795
Why did you deny Carroll tenure?

16:56.940 --> 16:58.340
Answer me.

17:00.764 --> 17:02.207
Unh!

17:19.766 --> 17:22.439
I never killed anyone
with a knife before.

17:35.693 --> 17:37.648
Press is using the cult word.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.671
It's out there.
We gonna comment?

17:40.042 --> 17:42.948
No. Let them speculate.
Where's Ryan?

17:43.063 --> 17:44.196
He went outside.

17:48.093 --> 17:50.110
There's no way you could
have stopped this.

17:50.657 --> 17:51.836
Yeah.

17:52.345 --> 17:53.399
I could have.

17:53.515 --> 17:55.281
See, that's the point.

17:55.387 --> 17:56.580
He's baiting me!

17:56.699 --> 17:58.143
I should have seen it coming.

17:58.258 --> 18:01.066
Why? Because you interviewed
him 8 years ago?

18:01.174 --> 18:04.574
Seriously? You know Carroll's
out to torture you.

18:05.588 --> 18:07.306
Well, it's working.

18:21.772 --> 18:23.135
- Professor Carroll.
- Hmm?

18:23.278 --> 18:24.957
Hi. Ryan Hardy, FBI.

18:25.075 --> 18:27.556
Oh, yes, yes.
My wife said to expect you.

18:27.761 --> 18:29.941
It's a pleasure, Agent Hardy.
How can I help?

18:30.069 --> 18:32.648
I was hoping to pick your brain
on a case I'm working on.

18:32.803 --> 18:36.245
Oh, the murders. Yes. Oh, gosh.
Awful. Poor girls.

18:36.361 --> 18:38.220
No. I'd relish
the opportunity.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.750
"Relish." I don't
mean relish.

18:39.871 --> 18:42.820
I mean, it's not every day
one gets to aid the FBI

18:42.947 --> 18:44.456
in a murder investigation, is it?

18:44.570 --> 18:45.363
Now a good time?

18:45.472 --> 18:48.726
No. I'm afraid not.
I'm already late for an appointment,

18:48.832 --> 18:50.660
but, uh, look.
Just call my office.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.200
I'm free every night this week.

18:52.313 --> 18:54.008
I'll do that.
Thank you, sir.

18:55.008 --> 18:58.025
Please call me Joe.
Nice to meet you.

19:08.696 --> 19:10.195
All right.
Get in closer.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.511
Smile!

19:11.817 --> 19:13.324
How was it?

19:13.433 --> 19:15.075
I don't like it.
One more.

19:15.471 --> 19:17.424
- Come here. Ohh!
- Ha ha ha!

19:17.561 --> 19:19.305
All right.
1... 2... 3.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.518
Can I call mom now?

19:21.714 --> 19:26.424
No, you cannot,
and stop asking me that!

19:33.466 --> 19:35.400
No. We can't
pretend to be gay.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.421
Sarah Fuller has major issues.

19:37.647 --> 19:39.039
She's not gonna warm
up to a straight guy

19:39.155 --> 19:40.717
the way that she would to a totally

19:40.882 --> 19:42.499
nonthreatening gay couple.

19:42.636 --> 19:44.791
Uh, I don't know.

19:45.494 --> 19:47.294
Joe thinks it's a great idea.

19:49.244 --> 19:50.810
But we're straight.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.965
Details. Come on.

19:54.172 --> 19:56.380
Expand your minds.

19:57.343 --> 19:58.453
Let's try.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.632
Kiss.

20:01.142 --> 20:01.937
What, now?

20:02.061 --> 20:03.656
Let's see if you can pull it off.

20:06.983 --> 20:08.869
No, no, no.
No way, no way.

20:08.993 --> 20:11.253
You guys are losers!

20:12.125 --> 20:13.927
So what am I gonna tell Joe?

20:20.556 --> 20:24.240
Okay. Okay. Let's do this.

20:24.373 --> 20:25.394
Come on.

20:26.135 --> 20:27.557
Gay chicken.

20:55.623 --> 20:57.134
What's wrong with him?

21:00.156 --> 21:01.405
Hey!

21:01.679 --> 21:02.451
What do you think you're doing?

21:02.553 --> 21:03.756
- Get away.
- Come on, man.

21:03.891 --> 21:05.079
Don't do this.

21:05.249 --> 21:06.463
Where are you going, huh?

21:06.571 --> 21:08.889
Hey. Your face is all
over the news right now.

21:08.994 --> 21:10.273
Don't be stupid.

21:10.439 --> 21:11.677
You're a liar.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.257
Authorities have yet to confirm or deny

21:23.386 --> 21:25.664
any cult activity
surrounding Joe Carroll.

21:40.027 --> 21:42.945
So does the coffee work
as an equalizer?

21:43.146 --> 21:46.868
That's the idea.
Rick Kester's records just came in.

21:46.990 --> 21:48.418
Take a look at this.

21:50.748 --> 21:52.237
Wait.

21:53.994 --> 21:55.597
A critic for the "Richmond Herald"

21:55.759 --> 21:57.308
Stan Fellows is dead.

21:57.448 --> 21:59.606
The assailant, a street performer,
is currently at large...

22:00.859 --> 22:01.895
Several eyewitness caught
the incident on camera.

22:02.002 --> 22:03.014
Come in?

22:03.820 --> 22:04.944
Excuse me.

22:07.163 --> 22:08.259
Claire?

22:08.364 --> 22:10.188
I'm watching the news.
What's happening?

22:10.285 --> 22:11.667
Listen. We have
a suspect.

22:11.781 --> 22:13.297
I need to ask you something.

22:13.410 --> 22:15.037
The man who's starting the fires?

22:15.150 --> 22:18.101
Right. I've just got
his credit card statements,

22:18.216 --> 22:20.289
and there's a couple of items

22:20.413 --> 22:23.053
that I just need
to confirm with you--

22:23.171 --> 22:28.839
All Pro sponge ball, Ridley Race
car set, dragon ninja warrior--

22:28.969 --> 22:30.852
Action figure. Yeah.

22:32.057 --> 22:34.076
Those are all Joey's favorite toys.
What's going on?

22:34.200 --> 22:35.679
This is good news, Claire.

22:36.425 --> 22:37.810
They bought him toys.

22:37.915 --> 22:39.668
Wherever he is,
they're not hurting him.

22:39.774 --> 22:42.882
I want him home, Ryan.
He's not gonna be safe until he's home.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.330
I know.

22:45.255 --> 22:46.665
I got to go.

22:46.772 --> 22:48.530
I'll call you later, okay?

22:49.187 --> 22:51.577
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

22:53.846 --> 22:56.267
I've been here all day.
Can I go now?

22:56.388 --> 22:57.611
Soon.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.639
Any idea why your husband
would purchase toys?

23:03.872 --> 23:07.763
I don't know.
It's his credit card.

23:07.866 --> 23:09.195
You'll have to ask him.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.448
It's Rick.

23:15.297 --> 23:17.957
Answer it.
Put it on speaker phone.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.289
Rick.

23:30.393 --> 23:31.771
Where are you?

23:32.393 --> 23:34.981
The FBI came to the house, Rick.

23:35.103 --> 23:36.609
What have you done?

23:38.051 --> 23:39.454
Are you with them now?

23:39.688 --> 23:42.217
Y-yes. Yes.

23:42.344 --> 23:43.468
They're looking for you, Rick.

23:43.566 --> 23:44.644
You're in trouble.

23:44.738 --> 23:46.863
How could you hurt those people?

23:47.907 --> 23:49.998
Where are you, Rick?

23:52.549 --> 23:54.597
Is Ryan Hardy there?

23:56.586 --> 23:59.144
Tell Ryan it was all for him.

24:10.661 --> 24:12.344
He's using the same
setup at their internet.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.370
It's being routed internationally.
We can't trace it.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.476
What do you think?

24:16.639 --> 24:18.073
We try and make contact?

24:18.317 --> 24:19.523
I don't know.

24:20.174 --> 24:21.780
Take her home, stay with her.

24:21.886 --> 24:23.276
I'll send someone to relieve
you in the morning.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.278
I'll go with him.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.000
No. What you're gonna
do, vodka breath,

24:26.103 --> 24:28.194
is go back to that dumpy,
little motel the FBI put us in

24:28.309 --> 24:29.158
and get some rest.

24:29.282 --> 24:30.247
I feel totally fine.

24:30.380 --> 24:32.468
When was the last time you had
more than an hour of sleep?

24:32.580 --> 24:34.555
You're gonna go, and you're
gonna get some sleep, Ryan,

24:34.664 --> 24:36.178
and tomorrow, we're gonna find Joey.

24:36.281 --> 24:37.787
Do you understand?

24:38.318 --> 24:41.289
Look. I get it.
You overidentify with the victims,

24:41.401 --> 24:43.981
the guilt makes it
personal, you unravel.

24:44.732 --> 24:46.419
I get it.

24:59.338 --> 25:00.784
You okay?

25:03.907 --> 25:06.287
Not going back to the
hotel to sleep, are you?

25:06.537 --> 25:09.559
I think Rick Kester
knows where Joey is.

25:10.849 --> 25:12.749
Well, they gave me a rental car.

25:18.421 --> 25:20.042
Joey's in his room.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.474
He thinks we got into a little fight.

25:24.062 --> 25:25.757
Paul just needed to
blow off some steam.

25:25.862 --> 25:27.975
Our faces are all over the news.

25:29.026 --> 25:30.338
What if he goes into town?

25:30.452 --> 25:32.700
I know Paul, okay?

25:32.897 --> 25:35.587
He's not gonna go into town.

25:37.209 --> 25:38.479
Did you send
that e-mail?

25:38.606 --> 25:41.410
Not yet.
I was waiting for Rick to call.

25:41.614 --> 25:44.428
Why is no one doing what
they're supposed to do?

25:44.758 --> 25:45.961
Damn it.

26:22.293 --> 26:25.288
Excuse me. Megan?

26:25.843 --> 26:26.778
Heh heh.

26:26.895 --> 26:28.230
Where would I find the wine?

26:28.350 --> 26:30.198
Oh. We don't sell wine.

26:30.577 --> 26:32.878
All we have is beer.
That's the law.

26:32.972 --> 26:34.655
Well, I really wanted wine.

26:34.764 --> 26:36.207
Hmm. Heh heh.

26:38.075 --> 26:39.363
Uh...

26:42.243 --> 26:45.515
So, uh, red or white?

26:47.393 --> 26:49.421
G-go with the red.

26:49.830 --> 26:53.436
And, uh, what time do you get off?

27:07.293 --> 27:10.655
Do you really think
he's gonna come here?

27:12.027 --> 27:14.476
We just want to keep
you safe, that's all.

27:16.238 --> 27:17.722
Do what you normally do.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.110
Pretend I'm not even here.

27:19.215 --> 27:23.343
Um, help yourself to the fridge.

27:28.049 --> 27:29.165
Yo.

27:29.289 --> 27:30.764
Okay. Hardy and I
are outside.

27:30.914 --> 27:31.914
What?

27:32.031 --> 27:33.410
Does Parker know?

27:34.969 --> 27:36.177
Yeah.

27:40.473 --> 27:44.755
Do you really think Kester would
be stupid enough to come here?

27:44.872 --> 27:46.623
He's already killed two people today.

27:47.002 --> 27:49.781
He's escalating, he's getting bolder.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.272
We'll be outside if you need us.

27:51.469 --> 27:52.629
Yeah.

27:56.585 --> 27:58.386
Does Parker know we're here?

27:59.796 --> 28:01.780
She told me to watch you.

28:03.823 --> 28:05.758
Look. I know you march to
your own drum and everything,

28:05.890 --> 28:07.407
and, hey, that's cool.

28:07.513 --> 28:09.462
Maybe someday I can, but I'm
the second youngest agent

28:09.587 --> 28:11.905
in the BAU, and people
still look at me funny.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.261
This is my career, sir.

28:20.870 --> 28:22.634
You still live in Brooklyn?

28:22.852 --> 28:23.819
Yeah.

28:23.943 --> 28:25.538
You ever make it up to Albany?

28:26.508 --> 28:29.037
I read your book.
I know you grew up there.

28:29.526 --> 28:32.188
Not for years.
No reason.

28:33.949 --> 28:37.729
Right. Family.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.832
Sorry. Um, I'm
a military brat.

28:41.941 --> 28:42.928
Was born in San Diego.

28:43.034 --> 28:44.022
I've lived
everywhere--

28:44.125 --> 28:45.570
I'm gonna take a look around,

28:45.677 --> 28:46.923
stretch my legs.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.487
Ryan, good to see you.
Come on in.

29:03.629 --> 29:05.068
I'm afraid it's only me tonight.

29:05.195 --> 29:06.345
Claire's out with the little one.

29:06.449 --> 29:07.219
Can I get you a drink?

29:07.314 --> 29:08.423
No. I'm fine. Thanks.

29:09.963 --> 29:11.378
My God.

29:12.104 --> 29:15.945
This is a moment when it
all becomes very real.

29:16.399 --> 29:18.272
Your wife mentioned Edgar Allan Poe

29:18.392 --> 29:19.986
as a reference for the eyes.

29:20.098 --> 29:23.004
Yes. Yes. What makes you
think that your killer has

29:23.135 --> 29:24.476
a greater literary purpose?

29:24.589 --> 29:27.329
Well, there's a sophistication
to the murders,

29:27.448 --> 29:29.649
the way the bodies are
handled and displayed.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.702
There's a...
romance to it.

29:32.825 --> 29:36.073
Poe's eye allegories
would certainly fit,

29:36.202 --> 29:42.036
and you'll find his symbolism
full of haunting romance.

29:42.143 --> 29:43.132
Here.

29:43.238 --> 29:46.089
Wow. Great.
Thanks a lot.

29:46.584 --> 29:47.768
I'll get this right back to you.

29:47.872 --> 29:48.924
No, no, no.
Don't you dare. No.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.610
This has-- this has
been a treat for me.

29:53.181 --> 29:56.595
Now please may I offer you a drink?

30:00.935 --> 30:02.313
All right.
Sure. Yeah.

30:02.424 --> 30:03.875
Whatever you're drinking.

30:16.821 --> 30:18.367
Hey. I need a breather.

30:19.071 --> 30:21.936
And more wine.
Ha ha ha!

30:22.612 --> 30:23.752
Sure.

30:29.113 --> 30:30.817
We're not having sex, okay?

30:30.926 --> 30:33.226
Let's just take that off the table.

30:33.345 --> 30:34.722
Okay.

30:41.955 --> 30:43.053
Unh!

30:43.155 --> 30:44.550
Wait. No.
That hurt.

30:44.781 --> 30:46.351
Were you just choking me?

30:46.463 --> 30:49.862
No. No. Of course not.

30:49.968 --> 30:52.014
We should get going.
It's getting late.

30:52.119 --> 30:52.952
But--

30:53.056 --> 30:54.930
I need to get home.

30:55.361 --> 30:57.359
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:58.785 --> 31:00.539
Okay.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.317
Wait. Let me get
the door for you.

31:08.005 --> 31:08.837
Aah!

31:20.944 --> 31:22.563
Don't be so happy to see me.

31:22.683 --> 31:23.986
Will you excuse us, please?

31:29.999 --> 31:31.717
I'm not talking to you.

31:32.164 --> 31:33.578
Well, you're gonna have to.

31:33.688 --> 31:35.540
I need some information
from you, Jordy.

31:36.540 --> 31:38.826
♪ Believe it or not,
I'm walking on air ♪

31:38.920 --> 31:40.124
So I was talking to Joe.

31:40.227 --> 31:41.465
♪ I never-- ♪

31:42.441 --> 31:44.605
And he wants to see you.

31:46.630 --> 31:48.194
I want to see him.

31:48.304 --> 31:49.569
I can make that happen,

31:49.676 --> 31:52.198
but I can't if you won't talk to me.

31:57.636 --> 31:59.184
You okay in here?

31:59.609 --> 32:01.429
Yeah, I guess.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.677
Are you married, Agent Riley?

32:06.794 --> 32:08.181
Divorced.

32:09.775 --> 32:11.970
Was she a good woman?

32:12.768 --> 32:14.479
She wasn't the problem.

32:18.559 --> 32:20.021
What was that?

32:25.467 --> 32:27.718
Was that inside or outside?

33:03.935 --> 33:04.935
Yeah.

33:05.035 --> 33:06.923
- You okay?
- I'm not sure.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.852
There's someone in the backyard.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.523
I'm coming in.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.397
How do I know you're not lying?

33:13.503 --> 33:15.688
What if I tell you stuff and
you don't let me see Joe?

33:15.802 --> 33:18.038
Character, Jordy.
I say what I mean,

33:18.173 --> 33:19.401
and I mean what I say.

33:19.507 --> 33:21.258
What if I tell you stuff and you
don't like the stuff I tell you?

33:21.364 --> 33:22.496
Do I still get to see Joe?

33:22.641 --> 33:24.114
Just talk to me, Jordy.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.236
I'll let you see Joe.

33:27.401 --> 33:28.576
I don't know where the kid is.

33:28.687 --> 33:29.866
Oh, come on, Jordy.

33:30.003 --> 33:31.253
I don't.

33:31.404 --> 33:34.341
We divide the secrets so no
one person knows everything

33:34.460 --> 33:36.576
in case one of us gets caught.

33:37.365 --> 33:38.510
So who has Joey?

33:38.640 --> 33:39.876
Emma and Jacob and Paul,

33:40.011 --> 33:41.385
but I don't know where they are,

33:41.515 --> 33:42.880
and that's the truth.

33:43.013 --> 33:44.050
Can I see Joe now?

33:44.176 --> 33:45.249
Does Rick know where Joey is?

33:45.369 --> 33:46.754
I don't know, but his wife does.

33:46.873 --> 33:48.027
What?

33:48.164 --> 33:50.556
Maggie. She and Emma
planned that part.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.465
Something's up.

33:57.867 --> 33:59.186
Hello.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.806
You lied!

34:00.917 --> 34:02.497
It's Parker.
Jordy just told me

34:02.600 --> 34:05.162
Maggie Kester is one of them.
She's lying.

34:05.456 --> 34:06.709
Maggie's one of them.

34:11.491 --> 34:13.495
Maggie, you're getting a message.

34:14.452 --> 34:15.695
What does it say?

34:15.784 --> 34:18.681
It says, "now."

34:19.784 --> 34:20.876
What the?

34:28.818 --> 34:30.563
Unh!

34:35.734 --> 34:37.246
Ugh!

34:44.049 --> 34:45.065
Oh, my God.
Baby, are you okay?

34:45.172 --> 34:45.998
You went too deep.

34:46.072 --> 34:47.913
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

34:48.032 --> 34:49.610
You lose.
You suck at games.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.344
He sucks at knives.

34:51.775 --> 34:53.670
All right. Who's next?
Truth or dare?

34:53.835 --> 34:54.980
Guys, she needs a hospital.

34:55.077 --> 34:57.445
What? Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm so sorry.

34:57.590 --> 34:58.895
Baby, I'm so sorry.

34:59.814 --> 35:01.385
There's no time.
We have to go.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.839
Oh, my God.

35:10.970 --> 35:12.158
Get an ambulance!

35:15.425 --> 35:16.427
Here. Hold pressure on this.

35:16.545 --> 35:19.234
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Hold on. I got it. Okay.

35:19.738 --> 35:21.217
Hey, Troy. Look at me.

35:21.339 --> 35:22.500
You're gonna be okay.

35:22.801 --> 35:23.848
Stop!

35:24.767 --> 35:25.715
Stop!

35:26.199 --> 35:29.588
No. Please, please.
He's gonna kill me.

35:30.299 --> 35:31.669
I don't think so, Maggie.

35:38.298 --> 35:42.870
No! Ah, ah ah!

36:25.430 --> 36:26.660
What is that?

36:30.032 --> 36:31.743
What the hell?

36:33.033 --> 36:35.802
Hey, guys.
This is Megan.

36:35.909 --> 36:38.304
Megan, this is Emma and Jacob.

36:38.438 --> 36:39.327
Who is she?

36:39.435 --> 36:41.288
She's a friend, and she's gonna be

36:41.401 --> 36:43.135
staying with us for a while.

36:44.381 --> 36:46.005
You have lost your mind.

36:46.349 --> 36:48.896
Yeah. I'm done
listening to her.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.765
Hey. I'll
take care of this.

36:52.144 --> 36:53.507
Go check on Joey.

36:55.845 --> 36:57.240
Go.

37:04.598 --> 37:05.937
What are you doing, Paul?

37:06.045 --> 37:07.703
I'm tired of being the third wheel,

37:08.474 --> 37:09.975
and now I'm not.

37:11.248 --> 37:12.857
I know you're mad at me right now,

37:12.976 --> 37:15.613
but you can't ruin things for everyone.

37:15.728 --> 37:19.719
Does Emma know what a liar you are?

37:20.216 --> 37:23.027
We promised we wouldn't tell anyone...

37:24.982 --> 37:26.904
especially Emma.

37:29.007 --> 37:31.772
I drank too much.
Sarah's gonna think I'm a drunk.

37:32.136 --> 37:33.719
Are you kidding?
She loves you.

37:34.270 --> 37:37.635
You had a few too many, too.
You know that?

37:37.747 --> 37:39.590
So touchy-feely
when you drink.

37:39.706 --> 37:41.148
Hey. It's for Sarah,
all right?

37:41.257 --> 37:43.039
I mean, we go to look
like a real couple.

37:43.143 --> 37:44.768
So touchy...

37:44.872 --> 37:45.916
Ha ha ha!
Stop that.

37:46.032 --> 37:47.834
- Ohh.
- Ha ha ha!

37:51.290 --> 37:54.341
♪ Under a blue moon I saw you ♪

37:54.478 --> 37:58.858

38:09.787 --> 38:11.037

38:13.584 --> 38:15.537
We can't keep her here.

38:15.669 --> 38:19.193
Look. I'll help you take her
into the basement, okay?

38:43.952 --> 38:46.464
That woman fooled me today, and I am...

38:47.656 --> 38:49.684
mad.

38:50.345 --> 38:51.912
Riley didn't have to die.

39:00.232 --> 39:01.261
Thanks a lot.

39:01.383 --> 39:03.070
I'll read it right way, I promise.

39:03.178 --> 39:04.706
Well, feel free to hate it.

39:04.790 --> 39:06.419
Everyone else has. Heh.

39:06.586 --> 39:07.697
It's not doing well?

39:07.812 --> 39:10.413
I think that's the third copy.

39:10.524 --> 39:11.791
Maybe I should give you
20 bucks or something.

39:11.894 --> 39:13.104
Ha ha ha!

39:13.218 --> 39:15.954
Listen.
I really appreciate tonight, Joe.

39:16.083 --> 39:19.086
Well, if nothing else
it's good scotch, huh?

39:19.188 --> 39:20.454
It's great scotch.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.222
You know, I've been working
on this case nonstop

39:24.323 --> 39:25.400
for months now.

39:25.517 --> 39:28.371
Sometimes I just forget to stop

39:28.497 --> 39:31.328
and turn it off for a few hours.

39:31.432 --> 39:34.425
I couldn't turn it off if I were you.

39:34.914 --> 39:38.064
Must be hard with friends and family

39:38.171 --> 39:41.555
when you're running around,
trying to chase down the bad guy.

39:42.884 --> 39:46.948
I imagine it, uh, it gets quite lonely.

39:50.914 --> 39:52.480
But the payoff, huh?

39:53.962 --> 39:57.165
Helping people, saving lives.

39:58.935 --> 40:01.492
You know, I think what you do

40:02.880 --> 40:05.821
is quite remarkable.

40:10.478 --> 40:12.295
One more, huh?

40:14.050 --> 40:15.525
Sure. Why not?

40:19.674 --> 40:21.225
Joe fooled me.

40:23.672 --> 40:24.964
I should have known from
the first time I met him

40:25.074 --> 40:26.248
he was the man I was looking for,

40:26.390 --> 40:28.969
but he had this power.

40:30.019 --> 40:31.931
I'm sorry, Joe.

40:32.076 --> 40:35.233
I'm sorry, Joe!

40:36.082 --> 40:39.157
Charmed and seduced.

40:40.185 --> 40:42.426
I know what his followers feel.

40:43.610 --> 40:49.448
♪ As I run blindly ♪

40:51.584 --> 40:55.830
♪ from the fear I know is not real ♪

40:55.960 --> 40:58.104
They're better for being near him.

40:58.839 --> 41:01.548
He knows how to give them
a little piece of...

41:02.606 --> 41:04.772
what they're missing.

41:07.695 --> 41:10.396
I'm sorry, Joe.

41:15.436 --> 41:17.127
I fell for it.

41:25.298 --> 41:27.416
And 5 more girls were murdered.

41:28.674 --> 41:34.720
♪ Let me hate for you ♪

41:36.295 --> 41:42.203
♪ and hate for me ♪

41:43.994 --> 41:46.009
I got your message.
What is it?

41:47.017 --> 41:48.623
I got an e-mail.

41:55.151 --> 41:56.954
See? If you catch
the sun just right,

41:57.082 --> 41:58.647
the bug catches fire.

41:58.764 --> 42:00.602
Why do you want to kill a bug?

42:01.217 --> 42:02.638
Because we can.

42:03.057 --> 42:05.342
See, if you kill the bug,

42:05.579 --> 42:08.529
then it dies, and your
life means a little more.

42:09.148 --> 42:10.614
I-- I don't understand.

42:10.738 --> 42:11.980
Look at this little guy.

42:12.121 --> 42:13.990
Whoa! Where did you get
a cute, little mouse?

42:14.103 --> 42:15.276
Caught him in a trap.

42:15.383 --> 42:16.686
Here. Screw
the lid on.

42:16.789 --> 42:18.130
It's got to be real tight.

42:18.241 --> 42:19.412
Then it's gonna suffocate.

42:19.530 --> 42:20.476
It-- it will die.

42:20.597 --> 42:22.684
Exactly. Here.
Screw the lid on.

42:22.828 --> 42:23.995
I don't want to.

42:24.223 --> 42:26.040
It's okay, sweetie.
Go ahead.

42:27.932 --> 42:30.120
Then we watch it go straight to heaven.

42:30.235 --> 42:32.336
- There you go.
- Yeah. Good job.

42:33.272 --> 42:35.190
I never killed anything before.

42:36.231 --> 42:38.123
We're just getting started.

42:38.799 --> 42:40.185
They're teaching him.

42:40.454 --> 42:44.261
Claire, we are going to find him.

42:44.389 --> 42:45.568
Then do it!

42:45.901 --> 42:47.652
Claire!
Claire, wait.

42:47.758 --> 42:48.822
Joey, can you wave to the camera

42:48.966 --> 42:50.688
and say, "hi, Ryan"?

42:50.776 --> 42:51.785
Who's that?

42:51.905 --> 42:52.935
He's a friend.

42:53.044 --> 42:54.731
Come on.
Just say it for me.

42:54.899 --> 42:56.596
Hi, Ryan!
