01:05.610 --> 01:07.570
<i>I have long feared...</i>

01:08.480 --> 01:11.990
<i>... that my sins would return
to visit me.</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:16.120
<i>And the cost is more than I can bear.</i>

01:44.100 --> 01:46.150
Samuel! A postrider!

01:57.280 --> 01:58.280
An "R."

01:58.530 --> 01:59.700
Good.

02:01.540 --> 02:02.700
What about this one?

02:41.240 --> 02:43.120
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:25.620 --> 03:28.080
Father! Father!

03:29.500 --> 03:33.420
Nine pounds, eleven ounces.
That's perfect. Perfect.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.960
Father, a postrider!

03:36.670 --> 03:38.180
Did you finish planting
the field?

03:38.630 --> 03:39.630
More than half.

03:39.890 --> 03:43.220
Those swimming breaks really cut
into the day, don't they?

03:45.430 --> 03:46.810
Told you.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.490
Thomas.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.070
Wait for Father.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.130
Sorry.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.040
That's her. The North Star.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.550
See?

05:39.920 --> 05:43.180
You start from the front two stars
of the Big Dipper.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.260
And then you count up.

05:45.390 --> 05:48.720
You count up five finger lengths...

05:48.970 --> 05:51.680
...and it's right there.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.810
And she'll always be
looking down on us.

05:56.150 --> 05:59.230
And protect us. Forever.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.820
Come. Into bed.

06:10.410 --> 06:12.870
Good night. Good night, Meg.

06:14.580 --> 06:17.330
It helps her to know Mother's there.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.920
Good night.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.970
So what was in the mail?

07:18.730 --> 07:21.190
"The New York and
Pennsylvania assemblies...

07:21.310 --> 07:23.650
...are debating independence."

07:23.860 --> 07:26.400
What about the middle colonies?

07:29.030 --> 07:31.320
"In Chestertown,
they burned the customs house...

07:31.530 --> 07:33.830
...and tar and feathered
two magistrates.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.500
They died of... They died of burns."

07:36.710 --> 07:38.750
Damn fools.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.170
Who? The writers or the magistrates?

07:42.880 --> 07:45.880
What does it say about
the Continental Congress?

07:48.630 --> 07:53.180
It says here they'll make
a declaration of independence by July.

08:10.610 --> 08:12.660
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.460
He's 17, a year younger than I.

08:32.220 --> 08:36.260
Well, the assembly's been convened,
so I've been called to Charles Town.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.480
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.100
We leave in the morning.

09:22.940 --> 09:24.270
Charlotte.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.440
The children are here.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.650
Thank you.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.780
Aunt Charlotte!

09:38.950 --> 09:40.870
Margaret, William, look at you.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.420
Missed you.

09:44.170 --> 09:46.790
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

09:47.630 --> 09:51.130
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.

09:52.170 --> 09:55.640
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait until you see what I have.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.430
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.100
Keep an eye on these heathens,
will you?

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
Sorry.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.820
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.040
She's still not talking?

10:26.540 --> 10:27.880
No.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.590
It does me good to see you.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.520
Look, there's Gabriel.

10:50.690 --> 10:52.820
Gabriel.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.950
Hang King George!

11:08.000 --> 11:10.130
Harry Burwell is here recruiting.

11:10.380 --> 11:13.340
The governor has vowed if the
assembly votes a single shilling...

11:13.510 --> 11:16.340
...to the Continental Army,
he'll dissolve the body.

11:18.220 --> 11:22.930
Wouldn't that force our delegates in
Philadelphia to vote for independence?

11:23.140 --> 11:24.930
Yes.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.190
Send us off to war alongside
Massachusetts.

11:31.270 --> 11:34.280
Get King George!

11:34.940 --> 11:38.030
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!

11:39.530 --> 11:41.580
That's enough.
Very well, children, inside.

11:41.780 --> 11:45.120
Come along now. Inside now.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.220
Burwell will be counting on your vote.

11:57.380 --> 12:00.760
And he'll expect you
to be the first to enlist.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.680
Yes, I imagine so.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.100
I'm sorry, the heathens are...

12:11.020 --> 12:13.230
They have long needed
a woman in their lives.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.780
A mother.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.240
Especially Susan.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.040
My name is Peter Howard.

12:32.710 --> 12:36.210
I lost most of my hearing
and my left leg...

12:36.670 --> 12:40.090
...fighting for the Crown
in the French and Indian War.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.510
And how did King George reward me?

12:43.800 --> 12:46.520
He cuts off my other leg
with his taxes.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.770
Miss Howard, isn't it?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.900
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.530
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.660
I believe that was one of my younger
brothers. Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.

13:04.160 --> 13:08.290
It was you, and it turned
my teeth black for a month.

13:10.830 --> 13:15.630
- and send a message to King George
he will never forget!

13:17.920 --> 13:19.300
Our first order of business...

13:19.550 --> 13:21.430
And our last, if we vote a levy!

13:21.930 --> 13:23.010
Order, order!

13:23.140 --> 13:25.220
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.680
First, an address by Colonel
Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.

13:29.890 --> 13:31.270
Colonel Burwell.

13:35.110 --> 13:37.230
You all know why I'm here.

13:37.730 --> 13:39.480
I'm not an orator.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.450
And I would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.330
I'm a soldier.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.250
And we are at war.

13:50.950 --> 13:54.420
From Philadelphia, we expect
a declaration of independence.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.750
8 of the 13 colonies have
levied money...

13:57.960 --> 14:00.090
...in support of a continental army.

14:00.550 --> 14:02.760
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.

14:03.470 --> 14:06.640
Massachusetts and Virginia
may be at war...

14:06.930 --> 14:09.010
...but South Carolina is not!

14:09.260 --> 14:10.270
Hear, hear.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.640
This is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies...

14:14.980 --> 14:17.190
...but for the independence
of one nation.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.440
And what nation is that?

14:19.690 --> 14:21.900
An American nation!

14:22.110 --> 14:24.650
There is no such nation
and to speak of one is treason.

14:24.950 --> 14:27.780
We are citizens
of an American nation.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.700
And our rights are being threatened...

14:30.910 --> 14:33.460
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.120
Would you tell me, please,
Mr. Howard...

14:36.420 --> 14:40.250
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...

14:40.500 --> 14:43.380
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?

14:48.350 --> 14:52.640
An elected legislature can trample
a man's rights as easily as a king can.

14:53.850 --> 14:55.190
Captain Martin...

14:56.730 --> 14:58.440
...I understood you to be a patriot.

14:58.980 --> 15:02.570
If you mean by "patriot," am I angry
about taxation without representation?

15:02.730 --> 15:04.070
Well, yes, I am.

15:05.150 --> 15:09.450
Should the American colonies govern
themselves independently?

15:09.830 --> 15:12.620
I believe they can. And they should.

15:13.500 --> 15:17.080
But if you're asking me am I willing
to go to war with England...

15:17.330 --> 15:19.920
...then the answer is
most definitely no.

15:24.420 --> 15:28.680
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...

15:29.090 --> 15:30.970
...during the Wilderness campaign?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.180
I was intemperate in my youth.

15:34.430 --> 15:36.310
Temperance can be
a disguise for fear.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.980
Mr. Middleton, I fought
with Captain Martin...

15:40.190 --> 15:42.900
...under Washington
in the French and Indian War.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.150
There's not a man in this room...

15:45.360 --> 15:49.570
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.

15:50.570 --> 15:52.780
There are alternatives to war.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.040
We take our case before the king.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.710
- We plead with him.
- We tried.

15:57.910 --> 16:01.420
Well, then, we try again and again
if necessary to avoid a war.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.420
I was at Bunker Hill.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.340
The British advanced three times.

16:07.630 --> 16:11.640
We killed 700 at point-blank range
and still they took the ground.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.930
That is the measure of their resolve.

16:15.930 --> 16:18.230
If your principles dictate
independence...

16:18.310 --> 16:20.770
...then war is the only way.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.860
It is come to that.

16:23.070 --> 16:24.570
Hear, hear.

16:26.650 --> 16:28.570
I have seven children.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.820
My wife is dead.

16:32.660 --> 16:34.870
Now, who's to care for them
if I go to war?

16:37.410 --> 16:40.670
Wars are not fought
only by childless men.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.540
Granted.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.420
But mark my words.

16:49.590 --> 16:53.600
This war will be fought,
not on the frontier...

16:53.760 --> 16:56.600
...or on some distant battlefield...

16:57.640 --> 16:59.270
...but amongst us.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.440
Among our homes.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.569
Our children will learn of it
with their own eyes.

17:08.650 --> 17:11.490
And the innocent will die
with the rest of us.

17:15.490 --> 17:17.079
I will not fight.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.869
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...

17:21.119 --> 17:23.880
...that will send others to fight
in my stead.

17:26.089 --> 17:28.089
And your principles?

17:31.630 --> 17:34.800
I'm a parent. I haven't got
the luxury of principles.

17:43.810 --> 17:45.610
We must vote to levy!

18:00.160 --> 18:02.580
28 to 12! The levy passed!

18:32.740 --> 18:34.700
You intend to enlist
without my permission?

18:35.320 --> 18:36.780
Yes, I do.

18:42.500 --> 18:46.380
Father, I thought you were
a man of principle.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.670
When you have a family of your own,
perhaps you'll understand.

18:56.390 --> 18:59.550
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.

19:15.820 --> 19:19.660
He's as imprudent as his father was
at his age.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.700
Regrettably so.

19:23.660 --> 19:26.210
I'll see to it that he
serves under me.

19:27.250 --> 19:31.420
Make him a clerk or quartermaster,
something of that sort.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.380
Good luck.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.830
<i>Dear Thomas:
Though many seasons have passed...</i>

20:03.030 --> 20:07.290
<i>... it seems like only yesterday when we
last saw each other in Charles Town.</i>

20:07.960 --> 20:11.040
<i>With sadness, I learned
of its recent fall to the British...</i>

20:11.290 --> 20:12.920
<i>... under General Cornwallis.</i>

20:17.090 --> 20:19.090
<i>I received a letter
from Aunt Charlotte...</i>

20:19.180 --> 20:22.760
<i>... saying she closed her home
in Charles Town after the city fell...</i>

20:22.930 --> 20:25.850
<i>... and moved to her plantation
on the Santee.</i>

20:36.150 --> 20:40.780
<i>Here in the north, our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation.</i>

20:42.490 --> 20:44.620
<i>Our losses have been grievous.</i>

20:50.920 --> 20:55.170
<i>My good friend, Peter Cuppin,
fell at Elizabethtown.</i>

21:01.930 --> 21:04.640
<i>His death has been difficult to bear.</i>

21:17.570 --> 21:19.990
<i>We will march south
with General Gates...</i>

21:20.240 --> 21:23.030
<i>... to fight the Redcoats
under Cornwallis.</i>

21:26.160 --> 21:27.160
Thank you, sir.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.590
<i>I envy you...</i>

21:42.840 --> 21:47.310
<i>... your youth and distance from this
cruel conflict of which I am a part.</i>

21:48.770 --> 21:51.560
"But I am fortunate to be
serving the cause of Liberty.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.940
And though I fear death...

21:55.110 --> 21:57.900
...each day in prayer I reaffirm
my willingness...

21:58.110 --> 22:00.320
...to give my life in its service.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.400
Pray for me.

22:04.070 --> 22:06.450
But above all, pray for the cause.

22:07.580 --> 22:09.450
Your loving brother, Gabriel."

22:45.740 --> 22:46.740
What are you doing?

22:53.500 --> 22:54.790
Turn around.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.800
Not yet, Thomas.

23:02.260 --> 23:03.260
When?

23:08.430 --> 23:09.430
Seventeen.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.810
That's two years.
It's already been two.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.060
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.070
All right. Seventeen.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.660
All right.

23:36.210 --> 23:37.710
Put it back, please.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.340
Father?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.880
What happened at Fort Wilderness?

23:50.180 --> 23:51.430
Put it away.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.900
- Throw it faster.
- You throw it faster. You're the one...

24:12.950 --> 24:16.460
Margaret, you go get your brothers
back up here right now.

25:21.560 --> 25:25.020
Back to the house. Come on.
Back to the house now.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.280
Come with me. Margaret, go now.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.870
They're going to come.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.960
Quiet. Sit down.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.110
Six-pounders.

26:14.610 --> 26:15.620
Lots of them.

26:16.580 --> 26:17.870
How far away?

26:18.870 --> 26:22.790
They're a long way off. They're most
likely heading the other direction.

26:24.620 --> 26:26.210
Put those in the house.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.170
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?

26:32.670 --> 26:35.550
Let's all stay close in to the house,
all right?

26:55.740 --> 26:57.120
We'll have to fight them off.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.200
Won't Father do that?

27:00.240 --> 27:02.620
They'll probably kill us men...

27:04.500 --> 27:06.630
...and do Lord-knows-what
to you women.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.460
Nathan!

27:35.030 --> 27:36.320
Slowly turn.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.120
Father.

27:44.410 --> 27:45.710
Abigale!

27:46.500 --> 27:48.130
Water and bandages, fast.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.670
The battle. Were you there?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.930
Have you seen any Redcoats?

27:57.180 --> 27:58.720
No, not yet.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.470
Abigale, the children, please.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.140
Children, come. Upstairs.

28:09.940 --> 28:12.320
Gates marched us straight
at the Redcoats.

28:12.520 --> 28:16.280
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.

28:16.530 --> 28:18.740
I was given these dispatches.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.910
As I left, I saw
the Virginia Regulars surrender.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.040
The Dragoons rode into them.

28:29.790 --> 28:30.790
Killed them all.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.800
Over 200 men.

28:35.300 --> 28:36.840
I have to get these dispatches
to Hillsborough.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.260
You can't ride.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.720
I can't stay here!
It's not safe for...

29:14.090 --> 29:15.550
Fire!

29:23.890 --> 29:25.350
Fire!

31:49.120 --> 31:51.540
Thank you for the care
of His Majesty's soldiers.

32:22.820 --> 32:25.820
Have a detachment take our wounded
to our surgeons at Winnsboro.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.450
Yes, sir.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.490
Fire the house and barns.

32:32.950 --> 32:36.120
Let it be known if you harbor
the enemy you will lose your home.

32:40.210 --> 32:42.090
By order of King George...

32:42.290 --> 32:45.710
...all slaves of the American colonies
who fight for the Crown...

32:46.010 --> 32:49.340
...will be granted their freedom
with our victory.

32:51.340 --> 32:54.930
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.230
Then you're freedmen who will have
the privilege...

32:58.480 --> 33:00.600
...of fighting in the king's army.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.360
Rebel dispatches, sir.

33:14.830 --> 33:16.200
Who carried this?

33:25.380 --> 33:26.420
Who carried this?!

33:27.460 --> 33:28.510
I did, sir.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.390
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.

33:38.430 --> 33:40.810
They have nothing to do
with the dispatches.

33:43.770 --> 33:45.650
Take this one to Camden.
He is a spy.

33:45.900 --> 33:48.030
Hang him, put his body on display.

33:48.570 --> 33:50.400
He's a dispatch rider.

33:50.650 --> 33:53.370
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.

33:54.070 --> 33:57.910
Colonel, this is a uniformed
dispatch rider carrying a marked case.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.450
He cannot be held as a spy.

33:59.660 --> 34:02.370
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.500
- Colonel...
- Father!

34:10.920 --> 34:13.889
Oh, I see. He's your son.

34:14.889 --> 34:17.760
Perhaps you should've taught him
something of loyalty.

34:19.100 --> 34:23.310
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.
By the rules of war...

34:23.520 --> 34:27.110
Would you like a lesson, sir,
in the rules of war?

34:30.030 --> 34:31.739
Or perhaps your children would.

34:36.870 --> 34:38.370
No lesson is necessary.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.540
Sir.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.620
What of the rebel wounded?

34:47.130 --> 34:48.380
Kill them.

34:53.340 --> 34:54.429
Father.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.270
Father, do something!

35:00.560 --> 35:01.560
Be quiet!

35:14.360 --> 35:16.240
Gabriel, run!

35:17.370 --> 35:18.370
Wait!

35:21.120 --> 35:22.370
No!!

35:48.940 --> 35:50.820
Stupid boy.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.070
Captain.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.700
Thomas!

37:00.010 --> 37:01.430
Come, child.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.680
I'm not leaving these children!

37:05.890 --> 37:07.270
Mercy!

37:08.520 --> 37:10.060
Get ready!

37:10.230 --> 37:11.230
Present!

37:11.440 --> 37:12.520
Fire!

37:56.730 --> 37:58.150
All of you, stay here.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.020
Nathan, Samuel.

38:39.820 --> 38:40.990
Margaret.

38:43.410 --> 38:45.950
Hide in the fields
with William and Susan.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.990
If we're not back by sunset,
take them to Aunt Charlotte's.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.540
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

38:52.210 --> 38:53.290
Boys.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.930
It's a good spot.

39:49.350 --> 39:51.470
Boys, listen to me.

39:51.970 --> 39:53.680
I'll fire first.

39:55.770 --> 39:58.690
Start with the officers
and work your way down.

39:58.900 --> 40:00.570
Can you tell the difference?

40:00.770 --> 40:01.610
Yes, Father.

40:02.070 --> 40:03.690
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.820
Samuel, after your first shot,
reload for Nathan.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.120
Now...

40:09.410 --> 40:12.040
...if anything should happen to me,
drop your weapons.

40:12.370 --> 40:14.000
Run as quickly as you can.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.710
Get your brother and your sisters...

40:16.920 --> 40:19.670
...and take them to
Aunt Charlotte's. Understood?

40:21.210 --> 40:22.840
What did I say about shooting?

40:23.380 --> 40:24.550
Aim small, miss small.

40:25.130 --> 40:26.840
Aim small, miss small.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.220
Boys...

40:29.720 --> 40:31.050
...Samuel...

40:31.430 --> 40:32.760
...steady.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.770
Lord, make me fast and accurate.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.690
Aim small, miss small.

41:26.940 --> 41:29.700
Aim small, miss small.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.660
Aim small, miss small.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.960
- On the right!
- To the left!

41:54.220 --> 41:56.310
Behind us! Up on the ridge!

42:00.810 --> 42:02.150
Form right!

42:04.150 --> 42:05.150
To the right!

42:07.280 --> 42:08.650
About face!

42:11.490 --> 42:12.990
On the right to the rear!

42:14.320 --> 42:15.830
To the right!

42:15.990 --> 42:16.990
Fire!

42:18.200 --> 42:20.290
- Reload!
- Reload!

42:39.600 --> 42:40.980
Behind you!

42:45.900 --> 42:47.400
Look on the rear!

47:15.290 --> 47:16.420
Lord...

47:17.670 --> 47:20.380
...we pray that you accept this child...

47:20.550 --> 47:23.550
...and keep him at your side
with his mother.

47:24.720 --> 47:27.470
We ask that you embrace him...

47:29.770 --> 47:34.140
...and help us to understand the
manner in which your mercy works.

47:34.640 --> 47:37.480
And forgive us our sins.

47:37.650 --> 47:40.820
This we ask in your name.

47:40.980 --> 47:42.780
Amen.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.640
Sir, we have the private
the Cherokee scouts brought in.

48:22.110 --> 48:23.530
Private?

48:23.820 --> 48:24.820
Private.

48:25.070 --> 48:27.030
Colonel William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.

48:27.950 --> 48:30.240
What happened? Who did this?

48:31.160 --> 48:32.240
Him.

48:33.580 --> 48:35.000
It was mad.

48:35.870 --> 48:37.500
I couldn't tell you who it was.

48:37.750 --> 48:39.790
Calm down. Calm down, man.

48:40.460 --> 48:43.300
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers
are dead.

48:43.510 --> 48:45.880
And I need to know how.

48:46.090 --> 48:48.180
- He said there was...
- Were you there?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.800
Then let him speak.

48:51.300 --> 48:54.810
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?

48:55.060 --> 48:56.940
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?

48:57.480 --> 48:59.650
I don't really remember how many.

49:02.230 --> 49:03.320
Maybe one.

49:05.570 --> 49:07.990
One man. Really?

49:08.360 --> 49:10.070
He was in the flank.

49:11.580 --> 49:13.200
All around us.

49:13.580 --> 49:15.080
Amongst us.

49:15.660 --> 49:18.290
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.

49:18.420 --> 49:20.080
He just vanished.

49:21.290 --> 49:23.630
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.

49:24.050 --> 49:25.590
A ghost.

49:27.050 --> 49:28.760
He was like a ghost.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.680
Enough.

49:33.810 --> 49:36.520
Bordon? Take a patrol.

49:36.730 --> 49:39.690
Capture this ghost before
word of his exploits spread.

49:39.900 --> 49:42.810
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

49:43.020 --> 49:46.530
He was with the Loyalist Colonial
Militia. He might be of use.

49:47.030 --> 49:48.650
Another colonial.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.780
Captain Wilkins,
where do your loyalties lie?

49:52.070 --> 49:53.160
To king and country.

49:53.490 --> 49:55.950
Why should I trust a man who'd
betray his neighbors?

49:56.790 --> 49:59.790
Those neighbors of mine who stand
against England...

50:00.040 --> 50:01.750
...deserve to die a traitor's death.

50:02.920 --> 50:03.920
We'll see.

50:10.260 --> 50:11.590
Mr. Martin!

50:18.060 --> 50:19.680
Miss Charlotte!

50:31.320 --> 50:34.120
You're safe now. Try to sleep.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.580
Good night.

50:35.950 --> 50:37.040
Good night.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.000
Father?

50:39.250 --> 50:40.500
Yes.

50:41.460 --> 50:43.580
I killed those men.

50:44.840 --> 50:46.290
You did what I told you to do.

50:47.750 --> 50:50.840
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.

50:53.300 --> 50:55.390
I'm glad I killed them.

50:59.060 --> 51:00.600
I'm glad.

51:10.440 --> 51:11.950
Get some rest.

51:19.620 --> 51:20.950
Samuel.

51:41.680 --> 51:45.020
You've done nothing for which
you should be ashamed.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.480
I've done nothing.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.320
And for that, I am ashamed.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.030
We'll go to Saint Helena.

52:34.440 --> 52:38.620
That's a free slave island
just north of Charles Town.

52:39.660 --> 52:41.240
Right under the British noses.

52:41.410 --> 52:44.750
- They won't think of look...
- I'm joining up with them.

52:45.410 --> 52:46.960
Gabriel.

52:49.040 --> 52:51.090
No. Your place is here now.

52:51.130 --> 52:53.420
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.

52:54.260 --> 52:56.340
Your duty is to your family.

52:58.090 --> 52:59.970
Don't you walk away from me, boy!

53:00.140 --> 53:01.510
I'll find you when it's over.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.520
No, I forbid you to go!

53:03.640 --> 53:06.180
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!

53:08.850 --> 53:10.310
Goodbye, Father.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.280
Gabriel.

53:13.940 --> 53:15.570
Thomas is dead.

53:16.150 --> 53:18.990
How many more have to die
before you'll heed my word?

53:49.060 --> 53:51.020
I'm losing my family.

53:54.730 --> 53:56.820
When will you be back, Father?

53:57.860 --> 53:59.240
I don't know.

53:59.700 --> 54:00.990
Tomorrow?

54:01.410 --> 54:03.080
No, not tomorrow.

54:03.700 --> 54:05.410
You say your prayers.

54:05.660 --> 54:06.830
I will.

54:07.580 --> 54:11.170
Take care of your brothers and sisters
and your Aunt Charlotte.

54:11.420 --> 54:13.290
I'm depending on you.

54:14.290 --> 54:16.170
As I am on you, Samuel.

54:17.670 --> 54:18.720
All right.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.930
Susan...

54:29.140 --> 54:30.440
...goodbye.

54:45.370 --> 54:46.620
Thank you.

56:54.700 --> 56:56.120
Halt!

57:00.340 --> 57:01.960
Make ready!

57:06.840 --> 57:08.430
Take aim!

57:12.850 --> 57:14.220
Fire!

57:26.280 --> 57:27.990
I'm not going back.

57:28.700 --> 57:30.910
No, I didn't expect you would.

57:35.500 --> 57:37.790
That Gates is a damn fool.

57:39.750 --> 57:42.040
He spent too many years
in the British army.

57:42.380 --> 57:46.420
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats
in open field. It's madness.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.220
Halt!

57:48.680 --> 57:50.390
Make ready!

57:51.050 --> 57:52.850
Present!

57:53.890 --> 57:55.140
Fire!

58:17.910 --> 58:20.540
This battle was over before it began.

58:30.220 --> 58:31.470
Retreat!

58:32.090 --> 58:33.930
Retreat!

58:41.020 --> 58:43.560
These rustics are so inept.

58:43.980 --> 58:46.440
Nearly takes the honor
out of victory.

58:47.360 --> 58:48.530
Nearly.

59:10.260 --> 59:12.300
Hello general, gentlemen.

59:12.510 --> 59:15.260
A glorious day
for His Majesty and England.

59:15.430 --> 59:17.560
Colonel Tavington.

59:17.810 --> 59:20.680
Always too early.

59:20.930 --> 59:22.440
Always too eager for glory.

59:23.770 --> 59:26.520
For victory, my lord.

59:27.110 --> 59:28.980
I believe we took the field.

59:29.150 --> 59:31.780
Next time, you'll wait
for my command.

59:32.360 --> 59:36.740
It appears that Colonel Tavington
prefers to follow his own commands.

59:36.990 --> 59:38.330
General O'Hara tells me...

59:38.490 --> 59:42.330
...you've earned the nickname
"The Butcher" among the populous.

59:42.540 --> 59:44.500
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.500
Gentlemen, my compliments.

59:47.670 --> 59:50.130
- To a victory.
- Hear, hear.

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:01.480
Hold him firm.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.620
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.170
It's a lost cause.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.520
Benjamin Martin.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.690
I'm in no mood for a lecture.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.360
Where's your General Gates now?

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.870
The last anyone saw,
riding hard northeast...

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.040
...his staff 100 yards behind,
trying to catch up.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.620
So who's in command?

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.420
I am.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.920
I think.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.460
What are my orders?

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.550
We're a breath away from losing
this war, Benjamin.

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:25.390
In the north, Washington is
reeling from Morristown.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.350
He's running and hiding
from 12,000 Redcoats.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.110
In the south, Cornwallis has
broken our back.

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:34.570
Captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took Charles Town.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.900
And he destroyed the only army
between him and New York.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.910
Nothing will stop him from
heading north to finish off Washington.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:47.080
Unless we can keep Cornwallis
in the south till the French arrive.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.210
They've promised a fleet
and 10,000 troops.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.090
When?

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:56.470
Six months at the earliest.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.090
You trust the French
to keep their word?

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.640
<i>Absolument.</i>

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.720
Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.600
French Seventh Light Foot.
He will help train the militia.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.770
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.780
You really expect to hold Cornwallis
here using just militia?

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.280
Not me. You.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.500
They're not soldiers, they're farmers.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.420
They'd be better off letting
the British march through.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.290
They'd be better off,
but the cause wouldn't.

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.380
How many men
does Cornwallis have?

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.800
8000 infantry.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.300
Around 600 cavalry.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.220
I'm giving you a field commission
as a colonel.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.520
Might I request that you transfer
my son under my command?

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.060
Sir, no, I...

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.600
That's done.

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:55.190
Thank you.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.030
Colonel, I've been a soldier
for two years.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.860
As a scout, horseman,
marksman, scavenger.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.620
- Is that so?
- I'd be of better use with Regulars.

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.950
Where'd you learn all that
riding, shooting, scavenging?

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.790
My father taught me.

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.420
Teach you any humility?

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.670
He tried. It didn't take.

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.760
He also taught you every trail
between here and Charles Town...

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.720
...which is why he transferred you.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:25.050
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of...

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.510
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.480
Very well, corporal. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:39.030
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:44.110
Corporal.

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.370
Be careful.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.830
Yes, sir.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.290
You have children?

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.380
French.

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:29.280
It skirts the mountain and then...

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:31.830
...extends down towards
the headwater here...

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.620
...and right across to the far bank
of the Ohio River.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.290
It's 100,000 acres.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.840
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:42.760
You will be a country unto yourself.

01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:48.140
His Majesty is most generous.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:54.770
Though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift.

01:04:55.730 --> 01:05:00.440
Yes, this is how His Majesty
rewards those...

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:02.730
...who fight for him as gentlemen.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:07.070
I dare to presume my own meager
contributions will be rewarded one day.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.320
You may presume too much.

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:13.540
His Majesty, like history,
judges us by the outcome of the war...

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.870
...and the manner in which
it was fought.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.790
We serve the Crown, and we must
conduct ourselves accordingly.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.840
Surrendering troops
will be given quarter.

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.380
These brutal tactics must stop!

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.470
Is it not enough that I have
never lost a battle?

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.890
You serve me...

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:34.390
...and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me!

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:39.060
I would've thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours...

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:40.650
...would understand that.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:45.570
My late father squandered any esteem
in which we were held...

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.650
...along with my inheritance.

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:53.790
I advance myself
only through victory.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.290
You advance yourself
only through my good graces.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.040
These Colonials are our brethren.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:06.090
And when this conflict is over, we
will re-establish commerce with them.

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:08.470
Do you understand, colonel?

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.510
Perfectly, my lord.

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.520
Reverend, with your permission,
I'd like to make an announcement.

01:06:57.810 --> 01:07:00.850
Young man, this is a house of God.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.060
I understand that, reverend.
I apologize.

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.940
The South Carolina Militia is
being called up.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.200
I'm here to enlist every man willing.

01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:13.450
Son...

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.950
...we are here to pray...

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.040
...for the souls of those men
hanging outside.

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.120
Yes, pray for them.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.670
But honor them by
taking up arms with us.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.550
And bring more suffering
to this town?

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.590
If King George can hang those men,
he can hang any one of us.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.800
Dan Scott...

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:38.470
...barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence.

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:43.690
Mr. Hardwick, how many times
have I heard you...

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.650
...speak of freedom
at my father's table?

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.530
Half the men in this church,
including you, Father...

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.570
...and you, reverend...

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.990
...are as ardent patriots as I.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:07.130
Will you now, when you are needed
most, stop at only words?

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:09.420
Is that the sort of men you are?

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.220
I ask only that you act
upon the beliefs...

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.350
...of which you have
so strongly spoken...

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.399
...and in which you
so strongly believe.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.040
Who's with us?

01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:44.890
Mr. Howard.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.100
Sir...

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.810
...may I have permission to
write to Anne?

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:56.820
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.240
You have permission...

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.660
...to write me.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.990
Oh, write her.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.830
Very well.

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.040
Thank you, sir.

01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:13.840
Reverend?

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.850
A shepherd must tend his flock.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.390
And, at times, fight off the wolves.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.520
Are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia?

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.490
God save King George!

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.220
I think we came to the right place.

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:49.730
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:54.230
But you can keep or sell me the muskets
and gear of any Redcoat you kill.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.830
They hanged my brother
down in Acworth.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.290
Every damned one of them Redcoats
deserves to die.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.080
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:17.290
...I wouldn't make it through
the first skirmish. No, sir.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.420
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:22.090
Occam! Get over here.

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:27.100
Ain't overly smart.
He's strong as a bull.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.350
Can you write?

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:31.220
No, no, sir.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.190
- Well, then, make your mark.
- Why?

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.350
I just signed him over to you.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.730
If you're willing, make your mark.

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:45.570
That'll do.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.660
I'll kill me some Redcoats.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:54.920
I believe you would.

01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:56.460
How old are you?

01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:59.250
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.960
John Billings.
I was hoping you'd turn up.

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:04.670
There's a story going around
about 20 Redcoats...

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.590
...got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.430
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.560
Aren't you a little old to be
believing in ghost stories?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.420
How many did you get?

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920
Twelve.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:25.710
Good.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.630
These men,
they're not the sort we need.

01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.060
They're exactly the sort we need.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.390
They've fought
this kind of war before.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.900
What about me?
Am I one of that sort?

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:45.860
Hell, no.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.450
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.450
I want accuracy and precision.

01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:59.120
Make ready!

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.420
Take aim!

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:11.930
Fire!

01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:52.680
<i>Dear Anne:</i>

01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:55.010
<i>Our force continues to grow.</i>

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:59.680
<i>As long as we continue to fight,
others will come to fight beside us.</i>

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:02.890
<i>I long to see you and speak to you.</i>

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:05.690
<i>I'm hopeful that our duties
will bring me near you.</i>

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:10.240
<i>Until then, I am and will remain
most affectionately yours.</i>

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.450
<i>Gabriel.</i>

01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:39.430
We surrender!

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.020
No! God, stop!

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:44.690
For the love of God, we...

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.520
These men were about to surrender!

01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:50.900
Perhaps.

01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:52.150
We will never know.

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:53.650
This is murder!

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.370
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats.
They've earned it.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.580
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:04.660
I know the difference
between fighting...

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.540
Go back to church!

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:08.040
Quiet!

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.210
He's right.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.550
Quarter will be given to British
wounded and any who surrender.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.510
They gave no quarter when they fired on
a ship carrying my wife and daughters.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.890
I watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.480
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.

01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:30.480
Who are you to give such an order?

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.440
I know what you did
to my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:40.410
We're militia.
This is not regular army.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.950
Every man here is free to
come and go as he pleases.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.330
But while you're here...

01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:48.170
...you will obey my command
or I will have you shot.

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:56.130
- Damn dogs!
- Shoot the damn things!

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.470
- Stay that pistol.
- They won't let you near the wagon.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.890
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.310
Officers' uniforms.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.400
What you think all this is worth?

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:16.240
It's the personal correspondence
of Lord Cornwallis.

01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:19.570
This is his journal.

01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:24.950
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs
and use the papers for musket wadding.

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:26.750
Eat the dogs?

01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:29.710
Dog is a fine meal.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.250
Good heavens.

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.390
I have some maps here for you.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:51.310
Put them down over there.
Thank you.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.860
Here. A proper musket for you.

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:59.280
I don't know about you, but I don't like
the idea giving muskets to slaves.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:04.240
Your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.750
Don't listen to them.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.420
If we win this war,
a lot of things will change.

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.880
What will change?

01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:25.930
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.100
But we'll have a chance
to build a new world.

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:38.690
A world where all men are
created equal under God.

01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:40.740
Equal.

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.780
Sounds good.

01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:47.330
I've just been in the mind
of a genius.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:54.630
Cornwallis knows more about warfare
than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.

01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:56.550
That's cheerful news.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.300
His victories at Camden and
Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.220
And he knows it, what's more.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.970
Perhaps that's his weakness.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:09.640
Sir?

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:12.100
Pride.

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:14.730
Pride's a weakness.

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.820
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.

01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:21.450
Pride will do.

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.460
Finished, my lord.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.920
I've taken it in at the back...

01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:39.880
...added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding.

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:42.880
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.720
It's really quite nice.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:48.850
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.520
Colonel Tavington,
why, after six weeks...

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:56.810
...am I still attending a ball
in South Carolina...

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.780
...when I should be attending balls
in North Carolina?

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.360
First, the theft of my baggage...

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.490
...including my memoirs,
on which I spent countless hours.

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:08.580
Then half the bridges and ferries
between here and Charles Town burned.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.790
If you can't protect our supply lines
against militia...

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.580
...how do you intend doing so against
the Regulars or the French?

01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:18.420
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.

01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:21.090
Colonel, they're militia.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.050
They're farmers with pitchforks!

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.340
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.560
Made so by their commander,
this ghost.

01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:33.640
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.

01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.810
You created this ghost, colonel.

01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:39.440
Your brutality swelled his ranks.

01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:41.980
Without them this ghost
would've disappeared...

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.570
...and I'd be
in North Carolina by now!

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.070
In my defense, my lord...

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.160
Oh, enough, enough!

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:53.120
A fine soldier you are,
bested by a bedtime story.

01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:56.420
Give me the horse blanket.

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:02.710
O'Hara, our supply ship appears
to have arrived.

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.760
Yes, my lord, it has.

01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:07.430
Then why am I still wearing this rag?

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:10.550
Your replacement wardrobe is
aboard ship, but...

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.850
...Colonel Tavington thought it best to
secure our arms and munitions first.

01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.180
They are being unloaded.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.360
You look good in that color.

01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:32.740
It stinks.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.540
Well, it's had a dead man in it.

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:38.710
The beasts took your dogs too?

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.330
Yes.

01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:44.500
Fine animals.
A gift from His Majesty.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.970
Dead now, for all I know.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:49.630
Is there no decency?

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:02.650
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.180
Mr. Howard.

01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:39.270
I've come to call on Anne.

01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:48.150
I've come to call on Anne!

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.610
Well, of course you
call yourself a man.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.950
Father, stop it. You heard him.

01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:58.500
Well...

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.710
...call on her.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.820
I'm nearly finished.

01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:31.360
You needn't worry, Father.

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:33.030
Yeah, I know.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:37.450
Bundling bags are a wonderful
tradition. I don't mind in the least.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.790
Be still.

01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:42.410
Tea?

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:44.790
Please.

01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:47.630
There.

01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.430
Come, dear.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.440
It's very good.

01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:15.660
I'm pleased that you like it.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:25.670
Peter.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.000
Don't worry. I sew better
than my mother did.

01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:34.550
I hope so.

01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:42.850
If you're just gonna stand there...

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:44.850
...why don't you read it for us?

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.690
I can't read.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.730
I can.

01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.990
"Take notice.

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.410
By order of General Washington
and the Continental Congress...

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:02.700
...all bound slaves who give
minimum one year service...

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.620
...in the Continental Army...

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.500
...will be granted freedom...

01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:11.920
...and be paid a bounty of five
shillings for each month of service."

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.800
Did you hear that?

01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:16.260
First they'll free them,
then they'll pay them.

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:19.800
Only another six months.

01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:24.270
What will you do with freedom?

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.320
I made this for you.

01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:55.510
Look after your mother.

01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:02.510
You know, Peter...

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.810
...I can't pay you for this.

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:09.190
Benjamin, you pay me what you can,
when you can.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.060
I'm obliged.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.690
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.150
No, no, he's more like his mother.

01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:22.160
Corporal!

01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.580
Take your time. Dogs.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.850
Sir.

01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:32.140
This road is closed.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.860
These wagons now belong to
the Continental Army.

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.770
Ready arms!

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.000
By twos!

01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:04.630
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.890
This is the king's highway.

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:10.020
And I advise you and your men
to make way.

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:18.020
Charge!

01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:20.150
Fire!

01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:22.860
Retreat!

01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:31.240
Save yourselves!

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.440
Retreat!

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.290
Ambush! Ambush!

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.620
I have the count.

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.880
22 are dead.

01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:03.000
18 wounded and 20 are missing.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.630
I'm through.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.260
He won't be the last to leave.

01:31:12.970 --> 01:31:15.180
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.

01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:17.390
- The French army is...
- To hell with you.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.190
And to hell with the French army.

01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:20.480
We don't need them.

01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:23.860
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.830
Father.

01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:44.710
Men always buy you drinks because
of what happened at Fort Wilderness.

01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:49.840
Strangers know more
about you than I do.

01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:53.550
Tell me what happened.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:59.310
Your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born.

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:04.860
I was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it.

01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:14.950
The French and the Cherokee
had raided along the Blue Ridge.

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.790
The English settlers had sought refuge
at Fort Charles.

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:22.250
By the time we got there,
the fort was abandoned.

01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:25.880
They'd left about a week before.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:29.880
But what we found was...

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.930
Go on.

01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.560
They'd killed all the settlers,
the men.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.400
With the women and...

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.820
...some of the children, they had...

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:52.860
We buried them all,
what was left of them.

01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:58.240
We caught up with them
at Fort Wilderness.

01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:02.910
We took our time.

01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:08.130
We cut them apart slowly.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.630
Piece by piece.

01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.930
I can see their faces.

01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.440
I can still hear their screams.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:28.900
All but two. We let them live.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.400
We sent the heads on a pallet...

01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:35.240
...with the two that lived
back to Fort Ambercon.

01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:39.240
The eyes, tongues, fingers...

01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:41.410
...we put in baskets.

01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:44.620
Sent them down the Asheulot
to the Cherokee.

01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:50.250
Soon after, the Cherokee broke
their treaty with the French.

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.050
That's how we justified it.

01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:05.480
We were...

01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:08.520
...heroes.

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:13.070
And men bought you drinks.

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:21.830
Not a day goes by where I don't ask
God's forgiveness for what I did.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.010
Thomas was my brother,
as well as your son.

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:38.260
You may not believe this, but I want
satisfaction as much as you do.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.350
But not at the expense of our cause.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:46.140
There will be a time for revenge.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.600
But until then, stay the course.

01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:54.900
Your mother said that when
I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:57.610
She'd say it to me
when I picked on Thomas.

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:04.910
I miss him.

01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:24.640
The British got 18 of our men
at Fort Carolina.

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.100
They'll be hung one at a time until
they give up the rest of us.

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.330
Reverend...

01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.540
...can you write a letter for me?

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.620
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:53.790
But first let us pray.

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:09.560
<i>My lord...</i>

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.650
...there is a rider at the gates.

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:14.770
A civilian carrying a white flag.

01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:16.730
I am occupied.

01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:19.610
He has a pair of dogs with him.

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.660
Great Danes.

01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.620
<i>And dear Lord...</i>

01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:27.120
...protect us in this,
our hour of need.

01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:31.040
This we ask in the name
of the Father, the Son...

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:32.960
And the Holy Ghost.

01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:39.300
<i>Wait here.</i>

01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:41.880
General Lord Cornwallis will be
with you shortly.

01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:28.350
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.

01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:32.270
Come.

01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:39.690
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well fed.

01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:43.150
I thank you for that.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.910
I'm afraid I don't know your name.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.370
I'm a colonel in the Continental Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.700
As you wish.

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:54.710
Please be seated.

01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:55.920
Thank you.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.670
Would you, as the initiating officer,
care to begin?

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:05.220
I will, unless you'd like to
claim aggrieved status.

01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:08.100
Yes, I would like to claim
aggrieved status.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.011
Very well, sir. Proceed.

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:14.731
You have in your possession
belongings of mine including clothing...

01:38:15.021 --> 01:38:18.521
...furniture, personal effects
of a non-military nature...

01:38:19.231 --> 01:38:20.941
...which I'd like returned to me.

01:38:21.401 --> 01:38:24.151
Indeed. I will do so
as soon as possible.

01:38:25.741 --> 01:38:26.821
Thank you.

01:38:27.161 --> 01:38:30.332
Now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting...

01:38:30.452 --> 01:38:32.452
...of officers during engagements.

01:38:32.912 --> 01:38:36.082
You must know that in civilized
warfare, officers in the field...

01:38:36.292 --> 01:38:40.672
...must not be accorded inappropriate
levels of hostile attention.

01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:45.262
To your mind, what are appropriate
levels of hostile attention?

01:38:45.472 --> 01:38:47.762
Imagine the chaos that would follow...

01:38:48.012 --> 01:38:51.183
...from leaderless armies
having at each other.

01:38:51.643 --> 01:38:54.813
There must be gentlemen in command
to lead...

01:38:55.063 --> 01:38:58.403
...and, where necessary,
restrain their men.

01:38:59.403 --> 01:39:03.533
Restrain them from, say, targeting
civilians. Women, children and such.

01:39:06.863 --> 01:39:07.993
That's a separate issue.

01:39:08.283 --> 01:39:10.073
No. I consider them linked.

01:39:10.913 --> 01:39:13.624
And as long as your soldiers
attack civilians...

01:39:13.834 --> 01:39:16.914
...I will order the shooting
of officers at every engagement.

01:39:19.464 --> 01:39:21.924
And my men are excellent marksmen.

01:39:26.174 --> 01:39:27.184
Very well.

01:39:27.804 --> 01:39:30.764
- Now, let us move on to...
- Prisoner exchange.

01:39:31.935 --> 01:39:32.935
Sir?

01:39:33.775 --> 01:39:37.105
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.

01:39:43.945 --> 01:39:48.575
I do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death...

01:39:48.865 --> 01:39:51.325
...but I hold no prisoners of war.

01:39:51.785 --> 01:39:54.876
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.

01:39:55.126 --> 01:39:57.006
Nineteen, if you hang me
with my men.

01:39:57.416 --> 01:39:58.416
My officers?

01:39:58.666 --> 01:39:59.676
Sir.

01:40:07.266 --> 01:40:10.226
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Below the tree line.

01:40:23.367 --> 01:40:24.527
Their names and ranks?

01:40:24.867 --> 01:40:28.787
They refused to give names. There are
9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors...

01:40:29.037 --> 01:40:30.827
...and one fat colonel
who called me...

01:40:32.787 --> 01:40:34.498
...a cheeky fellow.

01:40:34.958 --> 01:40:37.668
This is not the conduct
of a gentleman.

01:40:37.958 --> 01:40:40.798
If the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman...

01:40:41.218 --> 01:40:43.258
...I'll take that as a compliment.

01:40:45.298 --> 01:40:46.468
Get my men.

01:40:50.438 --> 01:40:53.188
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.

01:40:53.308 --> 01:40:54.608
Thank you, sir.

01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:27.720
Release the prisoners!

01:41:32.690 --> 01:41:34.810
- What is this?
- Prisoner exchange.

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:36.610
He has 18 of our officers.

01:41:36.810 --> 01:41:38.691
Who is he? I recognize him.

01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:40.821
He's the commander of the militia.

01:41:42.321 --> 01:41:45.161
- Your ghost.
- Stay that sword, colonel!

01:41:45.451 --> 01:41:47.781
He rode in under a white flag
for formal parley.

01:41:48.121 --> 01:41:49.371
This is madness.

01:41:50.081 --> 01:41:52.211
If you harm him,
you condemn our officers.

01:41:53.791 --> 01:41:57.962
With respect, sir, he's killed as many
officers in the last two months.

01:41:58.292 --> 01:42:02.762
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.

01:42:03.092 --> 01:42:04.632
Has he not?

01:42:08.222 --> 01:42:09.222
You!

01:42:09.972 --> 01:42:12.932
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!

01:42:13.142 --> 01:42:15.192
On that farm! That stupid little boy!

01:42:22.243 --> 01:42:23.613
Did he die?

01:42:27.743 --> 01:42:28.833
You know...

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:31.913
...it's an ugly business,
doing one's duty.

01:42:32.123 --> 01:42:34.253
But just occasionally...

01:42:34.913 --> 01:42:36.543
...it's a real pleasure.

01:42:40.674 --> 01:42:43.514
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.

01:42:46.974 --> 01:42:48.644
Why wait?

01:42:57.984 --> 01:42:59.154
Soon.

01:43:32.186 --> 01:43:33.356
Move out!

01:43:38.066 --> 01:43:41.526
But I still think it's imperative
to push north.

01:43:44.697 --> 01:43:46.997
One of our captured officers, my lord.

01:43:51.917 --> 01:43:55.167
<i>My reputation suffers
because of your incompetence!</i>

01:43:55.417 --> 01:43:58.337
That man insults me!

01:43:59.217 --> 01:44:02.887
Quite impressive for a farmer with
a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?

01:44:10.098 --> 01:44:12.808
I want you to find that man.

01:44:13.518 --> 01:44:15.568
I want you to capture him.

01:44:16.978 --> 01:44:19.198
The man has
the loyalty of the people.

01:44:19.698 --> 01:44:22.068
They protect him. Protect his family.

01:44:22.278 --> 01:44:23.908
Protect the families of his men.

01:44:25.329 --> 01:44:27.289
I can capture him for you.

01:44:28.869 --> 01:44:32.709
But to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat...

01:44:33.999 --> 01:44:36.209
What was the word
your lordship used?

01:44:38.089 --> 01:44:39.589
"Brutal," I think.

01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:49.430
Go on.

01:44:58.610 --> 01:45:01.150
I am prepared to do
what is necessary.

01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:05.951
I alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions...

01:45:06.161 --> 01:45:08.291
...free of the chain of command...

01:45:08.491 --> 01:45:10.711
...rendering you blameless.

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:12.751
However...

01:45:12.961 --> 01:45:14.751
...if I do this...

01:45:14.961 --> 01:45:18.881
...you and I both know that I can
never return to England with honor.

01:45:22.181 --> 01:45:25.931
What, I wonder, is to become of me?

01:45:33.522 --> 01:45:36.482
When this war is over here
in the Colonies...

01:45:36.942 --> 01:45:38.732
...the new aristocracy...

01:45:40.822 --> 01:45:42.612
...will be landowners.

01:45:49.953 --> 01:45:52.583
Tell me about Ohio.

01:45:58.213 --> 01:45:59.383
Make way.

01:46:00.513 --> 01:46:01.763
As you were.

01:46:04.883 --> 01:46:08.974
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles
from Wakefield, on the Santee...

01:46:09.184 --> 01:46:11.354
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?

01:46:13.434 --> 01:46:14.944
Benjamin Martin.

01:46:15.144 --> 01:46:16.854
He's the ghost.

01:46:17.614 --> 01:46:19.024
What do you know about him?

01:46:19.234 --> 01:46:22.824
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:27.574
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?

01:46:36.375 --> 01:46:39.045
His wife's sister has a plantation.

01:46:39.505 --> 01:46:41.135
It's not far.

01:47:14.917 --> 01:47:18.087
Aunt Charlotte!
Wake up, someone's coming!

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:25.267
Get the boys.

01:47:27.727 --> 01:47:30.347
Margaret, come quickly.

01:47:30.557 --> 01:47:33.358
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.

01:47:33.938 --> 01:47:34.778
Go.

01:47:39.608 --> 01:47:41.318
Stay close.

01:47:47.118 --> 01:47:48.538
This way.

01:48:05.009 --> 01:48:06.269
Follow me.

01:48:09.689 --> 01:48:12.229
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.660
Margaret, quick!
Get down there! Fast!

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.591
Samuel, get down there fast!

01:49:31.933 --> 01:49:33.903
Beneath the sill. There.

01:49:36.483 --> 01:49:38.024
There's no one in the house.

01:49:38.234 --> 01:49:39.694
They can't be far.

01:49:40.114 --> 01:49:42.494
Search the outbuildings
and the woods, quickly.

01:50:20.236 --> 01:50:22.116
Prepare to fire the house.

01:50:22.906 --> 01:50:24.286
Go.

01:50:44.017 --> 01:50:45.977
This one's head of the house slaves.

01:50:51.187 --> 01:50:52.777
Where are they hiding?

01:50:56.607 --> 01:50:58.987
Keep looking!
They're here somewhere!

01:51:04.828 --> 01:51:06.458
- Gabriel.
- Where's Father?

01:51:06.788 --> 01:51:08.498
Torch the house!

01:51:26.139 --> 01:51:27.139
To horse!

01:51:34.529 --> 01:51:36.239
Come on! It's all right.

01:51:36.439 --> 01:51:38.319
Susan, come here.

01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:48.710
Charlotte!

01:52:04.561 --> 01:52:07.431
They won't stop looking for us.

01:52:09.731 --> 01:52:11.851
You'll be safe where we're taking you.

01:52:12.731 --> 01:52:15.271
Father said it was
a perfect place to hide.

01:52:17.901 --> 01:52:19.401
How is he?

01:52:24.662 --> 01:52:26.412
I don't know. I'm his son.

01:52:26.702 --> 01:52:28.582
Where is Father?

01:52:30.122 --> 01:52:31.712
Speaking for months now.

01:52:31.922 --> 01:52:33.502
Speaking for months.

01:52:33.712 --> 01:52:35.502
Why did he go?

01:52:37.712 --> 01:52:41.552
He didn't want those mean men
to find you, so he led them away.

01:52:41.802 --> 01:52:44.182
He'll come see you
as soon as he can.

01:52:44.472 --> 01:52:47.103
I don't care. I hate him.

01:52:48.853 --> 01:52:50.563
Susan, you don't hate him.

01:52:50.733 --> 01:52:54.273
I hate him, and I hope
he never comes back.

01:53:28.105 --> 01:53:29.975
It's the children.

01:53:31.025 --> 01:53:32.025
Abigale!

01:53:33.945 --> 01:53:35.485
You're alive!

01:53:45.625 --> 01:53:49.456
I know it's not much,
but you can stay here with me.

01:54:08.517 --> 01:54:10.977
It's beautiful.

01:54:11.527 --> 01:54:13.107
Thank you.

01:54:25.407 --> 01:54:29.248
She spoke. Susan talked to you?

01:54:29.458 --> 01:54:31.088
In full sentences.

01:54:31.338 --> 01:54:33.968
As if she'd been speaking all along.

01:54:36.338 --> 01:54:38.138
Damn, I wasn't there for it.

01:54:39.508 --> 01:54:40.598
What did she say?

01:54:43.178 --> 01:54:44.978
She said...

01:54:46.478 --> 01:54:49.608
...that she loves you
and misses you...

01:54:50.019 --> 01:54:52.319
...but understands
why you can't be with her.

01:54:55.699 --> 01:54:57.489
My Lord, she said that.

01:54:58.199 --> 01:54:58.989
Isn't that something?

01:55:03.449 --> 01:55:06.289
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...

01:55:06.539 --> 01:55:08.369
...killing whomever resists.

01:55:09.039 --> 01:55:12.460
- Where?
- Seven homes along the Santee so far.

01:56:00.512 --> 01:56:02.392
John.

01:56:11.192 --> 01:56:13.523
John, this is not a time
for vengeance.

01:56:14.403 --> 01:56:16.983
This is a time for mourning.

01:56:21.613 --> 01:56:23.373
John.

01:56:32.133 --> 01:56:33.423
No!

01:56:51.444 --> 01:56:53.194
Attend to your families.

01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:57.865
One week furlough for all men.

01:56:58.695 --> 01:57:02.995
Any man who does not return will not
be thought a coward or uncommitted.

01:57:19.096 --> 01:57:20.426
Father!

01:57:21.846 --> 01:57:23.556
Papa!

01:57:29.606 --> 01:57:31.776
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

01:57:31.936 --> 01:57:35.066
They're from good stock
on their father's side.

01:57:43.747 --> 01:57:45.037
Susan?

01:58:25.209 --> 01:58:28.579
I see it. There it is. Look.
Look, Father.

01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:32.629
I got it! I got it!

01:58:33.009 --> 01:58:34.049
You got it.

01:58:34.839 --> 01:58:36.219
I got it!

01:58:36.429 --> 01:58:37.509
- Careful.
- I caught it.

01:58:37.719 --> 01:58:40.350
- All the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.

01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:49.110
Father, what changed you?

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.400
Are you sure I have?

01:58:53.610 --> 01:58:56.570
Yes. You changed.

01:59:04.041 --> 01:59:05.411
That's simple.

01:59:06.121 --> 01:59:07.171
It was your mother.

01:59:12.591 --> 01:59:15.511
A woman can have a strange effect
on a man.

01:59:16.801 --> 01:59:18.431
There were times...

01:59:19.091 --> 01:59:21.352
...I had trouble breathing
around your mother.

01:59:22.562 --> 01:59:24.222
I know the feeling.

01:59:26.312 --> 01:59:27.942
You once said...

01:59:30.902 --> 01:59:33.442
...when I had a family of my own,
I'd understand.

01:59:37.402 --> 01:59:38.952
You were right.

01:59:41.532 --> 01:59:43.413
You're trying to tell me something.

02:00:00.303 --> 02:00:01.683
- Apple?
- Thank you.

02:00:08.684 --> 02:00:09.734
Congratulations.

02:00:10.104 --> 02:00:11.774
<i>Anne Patricia Howard...</i>

02:00:12.064 --> 02:00:16.194
...will you have this man to be
your husband to live in marriage?

02:00:16.534 --> 02:00:19.114
Will you love, comfort
and honor him...

02:00:19.324 --> 02:00:21.534
...for so long as you both shall live?

02:00:22.124 --> 02:00:23.494
I will.

02:00:23.915 --> 02:00:27.125
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have
this woman to be your wife...

02:00:27.335 --> 02:00:30.005
...to live together
in the covenant of marriage?

02:00:30.375 --> 02:00:34.295
Will you love, comfort and honor her
as long as you both shall live?

02:00:34.755 --> 02:00:35.805
I will.

02:00:36.055 --> 02:00:38.885
Then by the power vested in me
by our mutual faith...

02:00:39.135 --> 02:00:41.015
...in the Lord, our God...

02:00:41.265 --> 02:00:44.555
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

02:01:11.717 --> 02:01:13.967
I'm sorry we didn't give you
more warning.

02:01:14.177 --> 02:01:15.217
It's fine.

02:01:15.797 --> 02:01:17.217
I have something for you.

02:01:19.967 --> 02:01:21.677
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.

02:01:21.927 --> 02:01:23.637
It's beautiful.

02:01:24.647 --> 02:01:25.857
Allow me.

02:01:27.228 --> 02:01:28.688
It's the North Star.

02:01:29.278 --> 02:01:32.858
That's the only star in the sky
that never moves.

02:01:33.148 --> 02:01:36.198
It's constant, unwavering.

02:01:36.698 --> 02:01:38.028
A guide.

02:01:41.498 --> 02:01:43.118
I'd be honored.

02:01:48.379 --> 02:01:49.419
May I?

02:01:49.629 --> 02:01:51.709
- If you must.
- I must.

02:02:07.979 --> 02:02:09.480
May I sit with you?

02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:11.730
It's a free country.

02:02:12.490 --> 02:02:13.820
Or at least it will be.

02:02:26.170 --> 02:02:28.250
I'm not my sister.

02:02:29.291 --> 02:02:30.961
I know that.

02:02:31.551 --> 02:02:33.131
Do you?

02:02:34.421 --> 02:02:35.971
Yes, I do.

02:02:37.011 --> 02:02:38.591
Very well, then.

02:02:43.021 --> 02:02:44.061
Well?

02:02:45.941 --> 02:02:47.191
Well what?

02:03:09.422 --> 02:03:11.173
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.

02:03:11.463 --> 02:03:13.213
Not soon enough.

02:03:13.883 --> 02:03:15.803
I'm counting on you to make sure...

02:03:16.013 --> 02:03:17.433
- I know.
- What?

02:03:17.763 --> 02:03:21.303
- Say my prayers, take care of everyone.
- Couldn't have said it better.

02:03:26.103 --> 02:03:27.143
Goodbye.

02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:28.903
Goodbye.

02:03:49.174 --> 02:03:50.424
Goodbye, Susan.

02:03:52.885 --> 02:03:54.175
Goodbye?

02:03:57.305 --> 02:03:58.975
Just one word, that's all I want.

02:04:08.185 --> 02:04:09.275
All right.

02:04:36.967 --> 02:04:38.387
Papa!

02:04:41.057 --> 02:04:43.437
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.

02:04:48.147 --> 02:04:49.567
Please, Papa.

02:04:51.987 --> 02:04:54.027
I'll say anything you want.

02:04:54.237 --> 02:04:57.368
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything.

02:05:00.248 --> 02:05:03.038
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.

02:05:04.168 --> 02:05:05.498
I promise.

02:05:06.378 --> 02:05:07.838
I'll come back.

02:05:08.668 --> 02:05:10.718
I'll come back. You believe me?

02:05:14.138 --> 02:05:16.219
You know, you make me very happy.

02:05:52.290 --> 02:05:53.960
Just the three of us?

02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:56.920
John Raskin did come by earlier.

02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:59.681
He looked around, then he left.

02:06:00.761 --> 02:06:02.091
He would've made four.

02:06:02.601 --> 02:06:04.351
Four would have been better.

02:06:39.631 --> 02:06:42.971
I got another two months to go
before I get to twelve months.

02:06:48.391 --> 02:06:49.431
Colonel.

02:06:50.601 --> 02:06:51.891
Reverend.

02:06:55.399 --> 02:06:56.859
Trust the French.

02:06:57.569 --> 02:06:58.859
Yes, trust the French.

02:06:59.069 --> 02:07:02.660
Where else do I get the opportunity
to kill a few Redcoats?

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:06.410
Perhaps a few wounded ones
when you are not looking.

02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:35.100
Everyone must gather at the church.

02:07:35.730 --> 02:07:36.770
Mr. Wilkins?

02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:41.360
Colonel Tavington wishes to address
the whole village.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.131
This town has given aid to
Benjamin Martin and his rebels.

02:08:03.721 --> 02:08:05.551
I wish to know his whereabouts.

02:08:07.011 --> 02:08:08.351
So...

02:08:08.471 --> 02:08:10.470
...anyone who comes forward...

02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:13.020
...may be forgiven their treason.

02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:19.730
Very well.

02:08:19.940 --> 02:08:22.440
- You had your chance.
- Wait!

02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:25.781
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!

02:08:25.991 --> 02:08:27.951
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!

02:08:28.161 --> 02:08:30.241
In the marsh,
by the old Spanish mission.

02:08:31.241 --> 02:08:32.411
This man here?

02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:34.790
- Yes.
- The Black Swamp, you say?

02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:37.170
By the old Spanish mission.

02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:40.670
Thank you very much.

02:08:46.841 --> 02:08:48.391
Shut the doors.

02:08:50.601 --> 02:08:52.561
But you said we'd be forgiven.

02:08:52.771 --> 02:08:54.021
And indeed you may!

02:08:56.771 --> 02:08:58.441
That's between you and God.

02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:06.860
Be strong. We must.

02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:10.660
I'll fire the town on your orders.

02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:12.080
The town?

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:14.500
Burn the church.

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.790
There's no honor in this.

02:09:21.130 --> 02:09:23.920
Didn't you say all those who stand
against England...

02:09:24.130 --> 02:09:26.630
...deserve to die a traitor's death?

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:31.890
Burn the church, captain.

02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:45.150
Give me the torch.

02:10:28.190 --> 02:10:30.821
The honor is found in the end,
not the means.

02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:33.821
This will be forgotten.

02:10:34.451 --> 02:10:35.701
Bordon.

02:12:15.341 --> 02:12:16.641
Anne!

02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:22.480
Mrs. Howard?

02:12:26.650 --> 02:12:28.400
Where is everybody?

02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:35.401
They're not here.

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.220
Gabriel's gone.

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:32.900
To arms! To arms!

02:18:52.531 --> 02:18:53.821
Father.

02:18:55.241 --> 02:18:57.411
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

02:19:03.879 --> 02:19:05.000
Father.

02:19:05.379 --> 02:19:07.709
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:10.049
I'll take care of you.
You'll be all right.

02:19:13.091 --> 02:19:16.681
I'm sorry about Thomas.

02:19:22.601 --> 02:19:24.939
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.

02:19:29.029 --> 02:19:30.279
That was mine.

02:19:34.570 --> 02:19:37.700
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:43.420
Don't go. Gabriel, don't.

02:20:12.490 --> 02:20:14.780
Oh, God help me. God help me.

02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:50.150
Where is he?

02:20:57.991 --> 02:20:59.991
I'll help you bury him.

02:21:02.161 --> 02:21:03.501
I'll bury him.

02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:09.460
My wife in Alexandria is with child.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.590
My first.

02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:15.220
I fight for that child.

02:21:17.801 --> 02:21:20.351
Benjamin, nothing will replace
your sons.

02:21:21.681 --> 02:21:25.851
But if you come with us,
you can justify their sacrifice.

02:21:27.691 --> 02:21:29.111
Why?

02:21:30.859 --> 02:21:34.859
Why do men feel
they can justify death?

02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:43.370
Is it arrogance or?

02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:50.040
I have long feared...

02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:55.299
...that my sins would return
to visit me.

02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.890
And the cost is more than I can bear.

02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:06.060
Benjamin, we have a chance.

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:09.810
Greene and Dan Morgan are
down from Virginia.

02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:16.070
If we win this next battle, victory
in the war is within our grasp.

02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:17.240
Go, then.

02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:19.321
Seek your victory.

02:22:22.740 --> 02:22:25.830
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.580
You matter to your men...

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.830
...and to others as well.

02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:34.210
Your victories...

02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:36.300
...and your losses...

02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:39.841
...are shared by more than you know.

02:22:40.931 --> 02:22:43.101
Stay with us.

02:22:43.601 --> 02:22:45.390
Stay the course.

02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:57.440
I have run my course.

02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:19.800
You men will be leaving with us.

02:23:22.801 --> 02:23:24.351
Prepare the baggage.

02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:29.910
Jean.

02:25:28.431 --> 02:25:30.551
You will be missed tomorrow, colonel.

02:25:30.891 --> 02:25:33.271
- Missed, my lord?
- Your wound.

02:25:34.521 --> 02:25:36.891
It's nothing, my lord.

02:25:37.231 --> 02:25:40.309
I am, as ever, ready to serve.

02:25:40.479 --> 02:25:42.359
Very well.

02:25:42.529 --> 02:25:44.939
Make sure you do.

02:25:45.489 --> 02:25:48.910
I stand on the eve of the greatest
victory of my career. Don't fail me.

02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:54.660
My efforts in no small measure
have brought you here.

02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:56.460
I grant you that small measure...

02:25:56.620 --> 02:26:00.130
...in spite of your failure
to deliver the ghost to me.

02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:02.750
Thus far.

02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:07.049
I will not tolerate
a premature charge...

02:26:07.219 --> 02:26:11.050
...born of your eagerness for glory.

02:26:11.470 --> 02:26:14.850
Wait for my order.

02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:19.560
Or you may abandon
any hope of Ohio.

02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:26.190
Tomorrow's battle can alter
the course of the war.

02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:29.410
General Greene, what exactly is
the task before us?

02:26:29.570 --> 02:26:32.700
Gentlemen,
Cornwallis has us cornered.

02:26:33.370 --> 02:26:35.080
Not only does he outnumber us...

02:26:35.290 --> 02:26:38.330
...but nearly half of our force
is militia.

02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:41.960
Unreliable, at best.

02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:44.130
Excuse me, sir.

02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:47.590
You underestimate our militia.

02:26:49.801 --> 02:26:51.181
All of you do.

02:26:51.971 --> 02:26:54.600
We've seen our militia lines break
time and again.

02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:56.470
Kips Bay, Princeton.

02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:58.770
But the British have seen that too.

02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:03.610
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that
he has no respect for the militia.

02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:06.730
What are you suggesting, Ben?

02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:10.070
I'm suggesting we use that.

02:27:17.251 --> 02:27:21.250
I know you men have sacrificed
a lot so far.

02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:24.840
But all I'm asking is that you...

02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:28.210
...let the front line of the militia
fire two shots tomorrow.

02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:33.471
A lot can happen in the time it takes
to fire two shots.

02:27:33.761 --> 02:27:36.221
Especially against British Regulars.

02:27:37.221 --> 02:27:40.981
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you
to fire three.

02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:40.490
If I die, I will die well dressed.

02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:27.830
Fire!

02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:34.550
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!

02:29:51.649 --> 02:29:52.729
Harry...

02:29:53.689 --> 02:29:55.649
...will you give this to my children?

02:30:06.210 --> 02:30:07.370
Thank you.

02:30:16.589 --> 02:30:18.299
It's October now.

02:30:20.930 --> 02:30:22.100
I know.

02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:25.020
It's more than 12 months.

02:30:25.470 --> 02:30:26.770
You're a free man.

02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:30.730
I'm here now on my own accord.

02:30:34.570 --> 02:30:36.650
I'm honored to have you with us.

02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:40.240
Honored.

02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:44.410
Shoulder arms!

02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:51.750
Forward...

02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:53.840
...march!

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:00.591
How old were your daughters?

02:31:02.681 --> 02:31:05.180
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.

02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:08.310
They had green eyes.

02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:11.350
I'm sure they were lovely.

02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:14.820
Yes, they were.

02:31:26.541 --> 02:31:27.751
- Battalion!
- Company!

02:31:28.121 --> 02:31:29.290
March!

02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:32.790
Fire!

02:31:35.540 --> 02:31:36.800
Unless I'm dreaming...

02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:41.340
...I believe I see militia forming
at their center.

02:31:55.899 --> 02:31:58.229
Battalion, halt!

02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:18.210
Dress ranks!

02:32:27.010 --> 02:32:28.510
Make ready!

02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:42.070
Battalion!

02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:43.320
Halt!

02:32:46.410 --> 02:32:47.580
Take aim!

02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:52.120
Fire!

02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:04.300
Fire!

02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:26.571
Hold the line!

02:33:32.541 --> 02:33:35.790
- Prepare to charge!
- We haven't been given that order.

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:37.420
Charge!

02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:39.670
Charge!

02:33:43.210 --> 02:33:44.590
Tavington.

02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:47.011
Damn him! Damn that man!

02:33:48.891 --> 02:33:50.391
Make ready.

02:33:50.971 --> 02:33:52.471
Take aim!

02:33:53.351 --> 02:33:54.391
Fire!

02:33:55.691 --> 02:33:56.891
Take aim!

02:33:57.941 --> 02:33:59.109
Fire!

02:33:59.149 --> 02:34:00.269
Retreat!

02:34:06.279 --> 02:34:10.320
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes
the glory from this field.

02:34:10.700 --> 02:34:12.290
Charge!

02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:33.390
Congratulations, my lord.

02:34:33.810 --> 02:34:35.430
Infantry reserve into the center.

02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:36.930
But you've taken the field.

02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:38.520
Now we'll take their spirits.

02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:41.730
Send the battalion over that hill
and crush them.

02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:43.440
It ends today.

02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:07.800
Hold the charge!

02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:09.880
Fire!

02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:12.431
Hold the charge!

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:17.560
Fire!

02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:24.190
Take aim!

02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:27.490
Fire!

02:35:35.741 --> 02:35:37.291
Charge!

02:35:44.130 --> 02:35:45.710
Charge bayonets!

02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:16.080
Halt!

02:36:17.290 --> 02:36:18.700
Hold! Dress your ranks!

02:36:21.330 --> 02:36:22.540
Fire!

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.590
Charge!

02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:52.900
Retreat!

02:36:58.160 --> 02:36:59.240
Colonel!

02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:02.500
The line is faltering!

02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:06.540
Retreat! Retreat!

02:37:14.430 --> 02:37:15.841
Wait!

02:37:16.641 --> 02:37:18.391
No retreat!

02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:24.390
Hold the line!

02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:28.150
Hold the line!

02:37:39.871 --> 02:37:42.911
Push forward, men!

02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:34.669
Artillery, concentrate on the center.

02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:53.610
If we reform and wheel right,
we may be able to turn their flank.

02:38:53.900 --> 02:38:55.820
You dream, general.

02:41:58.330 --> 02:42:00.710
Kill me before the war is over,
will you?

02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:05.220
It appears you are not...

02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:07.640
...the better man.

02:42:21.319 --> 02:42:22.359
You're right.

02:42:27.149 --> 02:42:29.280
My sons were better men.

02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:58.480
Sound the retreat.

02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:03.480
Sound...

02:43:04.610 --> 02:43:05.820
...retreat.

02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:24.880
<i>Dear Charlotte:</i>

02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:27.260
<i>The war has turned.</i>

02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:31.090
<i>General Cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north.</i>

02:43:31.261 --> 02:43:34.470
<i>We continued to engage the British,
and in the following months...</i>

02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:37.890
<i>... Cornwallis entrenched himself
at Yorktown, Virginia.</i>

02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:41.690
<i>Washington escaped from the north...</i>

02:43:41.850 --> 02:43:44.980
<i>... and surrounded Cornwallis,
who could not retreat to the seas.</i>

02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:48.650
<i>It was blocked off by
our long-lost friends...</i>

02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:51.240
<i>... who had finally arrived.</i>

02:43:55.911 --> 02:43:57.331
<i>Vive la France.</i>

02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:01.620
<i>Vive la liberté.</i>

02:44:13.801 --> 02:44:15.681
My lord, I beseech you.

02:44:16.261 --> 02:44:18.561
You must order the surrender.

02:44:19.391 --> 02:44:22.521
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.

02:44:23.231 --> 02:44:24.609
Peasants.

02:44:26.689 --> 02:44:28.779
Everything will change.

02:44:32.279 --> 02:44:34.280
Everything has changed.

02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:37.120
<i>Though he eventually surrendered...</i>

02:44:37.330 --> 02:44:39.790
<i>... Cornwallis himself hid in shame...</i>

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:43.580
<i>... appointing his subordinate to
relinquish his sword.</i>

02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:47.920
<i>With the war ending,
and our militia disbanding...</i>

02:44:48.130 --> 02:44:50.669
<i>... I take measure of what
we have lost...</i>

02:44:51.009 --> 02:44:52.549
<i>... and what we have won.</i>

02:44:53.719 --> 02:44:58.430
<i>My hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many...</i>

02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:02.520
<i>... will spawn and fulfill the promise
of our new nation.</i>

02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:07.860
<i>Tell the children, and especially
Susan, that I will keep my promise...</i>

02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:11.530
<i>... as I will be returning
to you all soon.</i>

02:45:17.780 --> 02:45:19.490
Where will you go now?

02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:22.500
Home. Start over.

02:45:22.750 --> 02:45:25.080
Your wife's expecting a child,
isn't she?

02:45:25.290 --> 02:45:28.040
She gave birth to a son
three weeks ago.

02:45:29.210 --> 02:45:30.590
What'd you name him?

02:45:32.670 --> 02:45:34.680
We named him Gabriel.

02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:41.310
Thank you, Harry.

02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:51.150
Gabriel is a good name for a farmer.

02:45:51.730 --> 02:45:54.150
It is. It is.

02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:55.820
Jean.

02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:57.110
Ben.

02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:07.230
Gabriel said if we won the war...

02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:09.560
...we could build a whole new world.

02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:13.360
Just figured we'd get started
right here...

02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:16.490
...with your home.

02:47:20.489 --> 02:47:21.870
Sounds good.

02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:26.370
Thank you.

02:47:31.170 --> 02:47:32.210
Ma'am.
