Make sure you're congratulating these
when they get back now.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.932
Just wanted to, you know,
remind you that you're in a competition

06:31.015 --> 06:32.642
and, you know, make sure that,

06:32.725 --> 06:35.687
you know,
you embrace that competition.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.732
Continue to show
that you're the alpha dog out there

06:39.816 --> 06:41.943
and just make sure
they see your work ethic.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.509
I got sweat in my eyes.

13:12.666 --> 13:13.918
You're doing good.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.753
As far as I can tell.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.996
He know what he talking about.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.763
Chauncey must've took
a lot of classes at Georgia.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.337
Bro, it's just 'cause my mama
had just came up here, bro.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.173
Yeah, you do got a lot of snacks.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.715
My mama just came up here.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.427
Lemme get
one of them jawns, Chauncey.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.794
What's the moral to the story?

26:20.495 --> 26:21.997
Let's go, Kam!

26:51.651 --> 26:54.112
If it come out on the ground,
it's called a fumble.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.872
I can't drop my head down
when I make a mistake.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.560
I missed your play
by, like, five minutes.

34:24.019 --> 34:25.020
I'm so mad.

34:41.371 --> 34:44.457
Yeah, I watched it this morning
with Coach Gasper.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.505
You're still not gonna beat
my record, though.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.466
You ain't gonna be able to do it.

42:23.457 --> 42:25.751
I always get answers
for them quizzes and something.

43:14.049 --> 43:15.968
Gotta ride with me one time,
Miss Brittany.

43:18.345 --> 43:20.681
Y'all, I can't never
get buck with Miss Brittany, bro.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.474
She always gotta cry, bro.

43:25.019 --> 43:27.521
Before I leave,
you gotta get buck one time now.

48:26.445 --> 48:28.197
Does the light hurt your head?

48:37.914 --> 48:41.293
I know you don't wanna do it,
but you have to put that helmet back on.

48:45.672 --> 48:47.132
The choice is yours.

48:49.343 --> 48:52.596
I don't want you risking getting
a worse...

48:52.679 --> 48:55.349
a worse concussion
than what you already have.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.809
But we need somebody to score.
