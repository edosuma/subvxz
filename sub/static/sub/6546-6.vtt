00:01.043 --> 00:02.169
-announcen
Previously on "Haven"...

00:02.253 --> 00:03.914
- For the love of Pete.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.499
No.

00:06.591 --> 00:09.207
What the hell am I doing
in Vince's body?

00:09.302 --> 00:10.291
- You guys switched?

00:10.386 --> 00:12.126
- We didn't even know
where it started,

00:12.221 --> 00:13.961
down here--
- Or up there.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.921
- You're gonna help us
solve a Trouble.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.006
We're taking her on a case.

00:17.101 --> 00:19.092
- Because Audrey's at her best
when she's helping the Troubled.

00:19.187 --> 00:22.099
Remember that night
in the hotel in Colorado?

00:25.109 --> 00:26.940
Audrey.
- Duke.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.268
- We found one name
at the Freddy

00:28.362 --> 00:29.442
who comes from Manteo,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.942
a long-time patient,
last name Doohan.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.945
- This patient's name
is Jeffrey Doohan.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.152
Nathan: I'm just gonna ask him
a couple questions.

00:39.207 --> 00:42.620
- Oh, damn.
man: Jeffrey, stay there, man!

00:42.710 --> 00:44.120
- This is not good.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.748
We switched.
- Yeah.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.374
- That is not Audrey, Nathan.

00:47.465 --> 00:50.332
That is Mara
pretending to be Audrey.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.541
- I don't feel so well.

00:51.636 --> 00:53.046
- You're walking
towards a thinny!

00:53.137 --> 00:54.547
- What?

01:07.443 --> 01:09.650
- Hey, taxi!

01:09.737 --> 01:10.726
Train station, now.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.357
- Let's see
the cash first, pal.

01:13.366 --> 01:14.697
- I don't have any cash.

01:14.784 --> 01:16.240
- Probably because you're
supposed to be in the hospital.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.318
- I can't go back there.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.198
I don't want to do this, but...

01:20.289 --> 01:22.029
- Hey!

01:24.252 --> 01:25.913
What's going on?
Where am I?

01:28.881 --> 01:30.542
Who the hell are you?

01:31.550 --> 01:33.541
(tires squeal)

01:40.142 --> 01:41.473
Duke:
So, after the phone call,

01:41.560 --> 01:43.471
she went back
to being Mara again.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.723
I guess she always was.

01:45.815 --> 01:46.930
Nathan: No, not always.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.401
I know she was really Audrey
back in the Cabin.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.725
I'm sure of it.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.311
Then Mara realized that Audrey
was coming back to the surface.

01:53.406 --> 01:56.443
- And that's when she decided
she could start playing us.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.569
- Yeah.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.196
- But now we've got
the advantage.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.868
- And hoW's that?

02:00.955 --> 02:02.661
- She doesn't know that we know

02:02.748 --> 02:05.239
that she's pretending
to be Audrey.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.747
And she doesn't know that
we've gone all "Freaky Friday",

02:08.838 --> 02:09.827
switched bodies.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.123
It's weird.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.457
- Yeah.

02:14.552 --> 02:15.541
Okay.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.427
All right, you made your point.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.924
- Your whole body is numb.

02:20.016 --> 02:21.881
- Yeah, and I didn't realize...

02:23.477 --> 02:24.933
you went commando.

02:25.021 --> 02:26.682
- Lets things breathe.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.022
Nathan, how long
have you known me?

02:32.028 --> 02:33.438
- Maybe we can use our switch,

02:33.529 --> 02:35.360
come at her
from different angles,

02:35.448 --> 02:38.281
trip Mara up,
get Audrey to come out for real.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.949
- Well, you're gonna have
to start talking more like me.

02:41.037 --> 02:44.074
- So Audrey can reminisce
more about Colorado?

02:44.165 --> 02:45.996
- Hey, Nathan,
she is just trying

02:46.083 --> 02:47.619
to get us to turn on each other.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.326
- (groans)
She may not have to.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.457
Duke, I didn't realize
it was this bad.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.163
- My body needs
to let out a Trouble,

02:54.258 --> 02:55.498
or it's gonna explode.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.629
- And I am in your body.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.085
- Doesn't really matter.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.796
If you die, we both die.

03:01.891 --> 03:04.132
- Maybe not,
if we get Audrey up first.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.354
(gasps)

03:09.231 --> 03:10.391
(Nathan groans)

03:15.780 --> 03:17.771
Mara: What the hell are you two
doing out there?

03:17.865 --> 03:21.232
Why isn't one of you trying
to force-feed me carbs?

03:21.327 --> 03:23.488
- Breakfast on the go today,
Parker.

03:23.579 --> 03:26.662
We got a Trouble to solve...
Parker.

03:26.749 --> 03:28.114
See, Nathan?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.245
I can totally sound like you.

03:30.336 --> 03:34.830
Just stick-up-my-ass serious,
sprinkle in a few "Parkers."

03:34.924 --> 03:36.255
- Well, I'll just try
to look annoyed

03:36.342 --> 03:37.377
at everyone all the time.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.880
- Ain't easy being me, Nathan.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.710
Let's figure out who's causing
this switching Trouble

03:41.806 --> 03:42.841
and get Audrey out.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.923
- Come on.

03:48.604 --> 03:49.935
J‘J‘

04:21.387 --> 04:24.754
- This is a disaster, Dave.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.340
Mara is looking everywhere
for an open thinny.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.300
What if she discovers
there's one right here

04:29.395 --> 04:30.885
outside Allison's house?

04:30.980 --> 04:33.016
- Not just any thinny, Vince.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.348
This could be where I was...

04:35.443 --> 04:38.105
when I first came
into the world as a baby.

04:38.195 --> 04:42.529
- Well, according
to historical society database,

04:42.616 --> 04:44.026
the house was occupied

04:44.118 --> 04:45.858
by Allison's grandparents
backthen.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.740
There's no record
that anyone in her family

04:48.831 --> 04:50.742
ever gave a baby up
for adoption.

04:50.833 --> 04:54.166
- Well, then how did
Agent Howard get a hold of me?

04:54.253 --> 04:58.587
And what does it all have to do
with the body-switching?

04:58.674 --> 05:01.381
- I have no idea.
We need to solve that first.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.131
The moment we switched,
what were you doing?

05:05.139 --> 05:06.174
- Nothing unusual.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.096
l was just getting
our morning coffees.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.391
Jeffrey Doohan couldn't
have been in the shop.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.469
He was still locked up
in the Freddy.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.396
- But when l was in
The Old Croatoan Cafe,

05:15.483 --> 05:17.269
maybe his brother Skip
was there.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.486
- And Troubles run
in the family.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.935
- Right.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.941
- Both brothers
must have it now.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.772
- I suggest we have
another chat--

05:24.867 --> 05:27.324
both: With Skip's wife.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.070
Duke:
It's so weird you're Dwight.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.905
- Shut up and listen, Nathan.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.286
So it looks like
when Jeffrey touched the cabbie,

05:35.377 --> 05:37.117
the cabbie switched
with his wife,

05:37.213 --> 05:39.169
who was having a nooner
with her contractor.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.633
The wife rushes home
in her husband's body

05:41.717 --> 05:45.301
and is immediately assaulted
by her cabbie husband,

05:45.387 --> 05:47.298
who is in her body.

05:47.389 --> 05:51.758
- So we have to find Jeffrey
before he switches more people.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.183
- This body-switching
is dangerous,

05:53.270 --> 05:54.430
and it has to be stopped.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.013
Now, the cabbie said he's
on his way to the train station,

05:57.107 --> 05:58.768
which I can check out

05:58.859 --> 06:00.975
while you find out what's
going on at the Freddy.

06:01.070 --> 06:03.152
Ah, I will be so glad

06:03.239 --> 06:05.696
when I have control
over my body again.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.648
Gloria's bunions
are killing me.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.369
- There's one more thing,
Dwight.

06:12.456 --> 06:16.119
I need to make sure
that I have the combination

06:16.210 --> 06:17.325
to the gun locker.

06:18.337 --> 06:23.127
Also, I seem to have
misplaced my key

06:23.217 --> 06:24.252
to the evidence room.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.923
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.596
Duke.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.968
- Feels about as weird
as you look, Squatch.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.179
- Well, at least
you're the same gender.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.731
- Well...
- When?

06:40.818 --> 06:41.978
- We switched this morning.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.185
But Mara doesn't know,
and we are not telling her.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.316
- This is a disaster.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.238
I mean, are you getting
anywhere with Audrey?

06:48.325 --> 06:50.441
ls working the case
doing anything at all?

06:50.536 --> 06:53.699
- We thought it was,
but Mara was gaming us.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.199
We need a new strategy.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.747
- Yeah, we need
to solve this Trouble.

06:56.834 --> 06:59.496
I hate to be the one
to ask this, but...

06:59.587 --> 07:03.171
are you sure Audrey's
still in there?

07:03.257 --> 07:04.713
- If you'd asked me
this morning,

07:04.800 --> 07:07.132
I would have said definitely,
but now--

07:09.513 --> 07:11.845
Just have to keep trying.

07:14.184 --> 07:17.312
Duke: Well, threatening her
with the Taser works.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.808
- Yeah, now we just got
to get Audrey out.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.851
- What would Nathan
do right now?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.278
- I thought you knew me so well.
- Oh, I do.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.072
Thinking like Nathan the cop,

07:31.160 --> 07:34.573
let's just say it doesn't
exactly come naturally to me.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.574
- This is a problem, Duke,
it's only a matter of time

07:36.665 --> 07:39.077
before Mara figures out
we switched.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.578
And back when she was
pretending to be Audrey,

07:40.669 --> 07:41.704
we didn't tell her.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.207
So she's gonna know
that we're onto her.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.664
We need a new plan.

07:46.759 --> 07:48.920
(gasps)

07:49.011 --> 07:50.592
- You're bleeding.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.092
Don't let it hit the ground,
or you'll cause another Trouble.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.264
- Don't let it touch anything.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.444
- What does this mean?

08:13.535 --> 08:14.991
- It means we don't
have any time.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.786
Nathan, I got to get you
to let out a Trouble.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.579
- I thought you needed
Mara's help for that.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.656
- No, no.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.163
See, that's what Mara
wants me to think,

08:23.253 --> 08:26.962
but I let out
that monkey Trouble by myself,

08:27.049 --> 08:28.459
killed the grass too.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.585
- You can't control it, Duke.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.339
I'm not gonna let out some
Trouble that could kill people.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.418
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.681
What if we find something

08:37.768 --> 08:40.635
that we can actually use
to help us?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.515
I remember reading about this.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.471
My great-grandfather
killed this guy

08:44.566 --> 08:45.897
with a reincarnation Trouble.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.315
Different past lives
would come out.

08:47.403 --> 08:50.270
What if you bleed on the ground,
release that Trouble?

08:50.364 --> 08:52.980
Maybe we use that on Mara,

08:53.075 --> 08:54.440
get Audrey to pop out.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.524
- It won't work.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.780
Mara is immune to the Troubles.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.487
- But is she immune
to my Trouble?

09:00.582 --> 09:05.451
Back in the cabin when I had
that gibberish thing, she--

09:05.546 --> 09:06.661
She couldn't understand me.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.168
If she's immune,
she should have been able to.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.716
And then Audrey,
or who we thought was Audrey,

09:12.803 --> 09:14.464
told me I'm something new.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.712
Mara doesn't even know

09:16.807 --> 09:19.139
what these Troubles inside me
are capable of.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.262
- Mara lied to you.
- Maybe.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.342
But if I'm playing someone,

09:22.438 --> 09:25.180
I sprinkle in a bit of the truth
now and then.

09:25.274 --> 09:29.017
- You really think I can let out
a reincarnation Trouble

09:29.111 --> 09:31.523
that will bring Audrey
out of Mara?

09:31.613 --> 09:32.602
- Yeah.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.610
I'll talk you through it.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.743
We get this right,
my body doesn't blow,

09:39.830 --> 09:42.162
and we get Audrey back.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.662
- And if we're wrong...
we're all dead.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.465
Let's go get our happy camper.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.175
- We just want to know
why you lied to us about Haven,

09:59.266 --> 10:00.927
when your brother-in-law
is locked up

10:01.018 --> 10:02.383
in its local loony bin.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.093
- And why you called them.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.645
- They actually called me.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.224
- They told you what happened

10:10.319 --> 10:12.401
between the orderly
and the inmate?

10:12.488 --> 10:15.525
Someone at the Freddy
tell you about the body switch,

10:15.616 --> 10:17.447
how it was Jeffrey's doing?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.070
- You know about--
About the--

10:19.161 --> 10:20.196
- Troubles?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.949
Oh, my dear,
more than we want to.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.905
- Especially right now.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.958
- The two of you switched?

10:28.045 --> 10:29.034
- Yeah.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.621
- Well...

10:31.715 --> 10:34.297
- What can you tell us about
your brother-in-law Jeffrey?

10:34.384 --> 10:37.342
Why is he institutionalized?

10:37.429 --> 10:40.387
- The man up in Haven
is actually Skip...

10:42.059 --> 10:43.048
my husband.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.392
They switched years ago.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.768
- So, if Nathan can leak
a Trouble out of my body

10:53.862 --> 10:58.071
that turns Mara into Audrey,
then... we're golden.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.614
Dwight: Oh, yeah, piece of cake.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.612
Where '3 Nathan right now?

11:01.703 --> 11:03.989
- With Mara, setting the trap.

11:04.081 --> 11:07.915
- Jeffrey came here
about 12 years ago.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.332
I had just started.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.329
He was completely delusional--

11:13.423 --> 11:16.130
Crazy fantasies
of being someone else.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.085
I always felt sorry for him.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.297
- You cared...
when no one else did.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.225
- Glad you're feeling better,
Detective.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.983
- I haven't been in the field
in a while.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.186
Tell us more about Jeffrey.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.148
- Skip and I had been married
a couple of years

11:40.242 --> 11:41.527
when the switch happened.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.405
I actually met Jeffrey first.

11:44.496 --> 11:48.535
He was always
so quiet and kind.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.992
Skip was the more outgoing
and confident one.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.044
Skip and I got married,

11:55.132 --> 11:57.623
and things were good
for a while...

12:00.137 --> 12:05.757
until-- until I found out about
the lying and the cheating.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.846
And I was... too young

12:11.940 --> 12:14.181
and too afraid to leave.

12:14.276 --> 12:17.985
Finally,
Jeffrey confronted him.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.323
- His brother Jeffrey
was in love with you?

12:21.783 --> 12:24.525
- And I never knew it
until then.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.531
When he confronted Skip,
something happened,

12:26.622 --> 12:29.159
and that triggered the switch.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.538
And then, suddenly,
my life was wonderful.

12:33.629 --> 12:37.622
I was with the man I was
always supposed to be with.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.668
- How did your
brother-in-law Jeffrey

12:41.762 --> 12:43.377
wind up in Haven?

12:43.472 --> 12:46.555
- Jeffrey was brought in
by his sister-in-law.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.883
She was there on behalf
of the family.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.389
They wanted him
to be well taken care of,

12:51.480 --> 12:54.813
but his delusions had become
too much for his loved ones.

12:54.900 --> 12:59.690
- We convinced Jeffrey
that he had lost his mind.

12:59.780 --> 13:03.739
And I took him to Haven
to be institutionalized.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.281
- Why Haven?

13:05.369 --> 13:06.779
- My mother had always told me

13:06.870 --> 13:08.826
that Haven was a safe place
for the Troubled.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.325
It's been the burden
of our family

13:11.416 --> 13:13.748
to watch over
the weird occurrences

13:13.835 --> 13:15.371
in this part of the world.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.499
- So, after you left Jeffrey
at Haven,

13:18.590 --> 13:19.796
did you stay in contact?

13:19.883 --> 13:23.796
- Yeah, I called once in a while
to check in,

13:23.887 --> 13:25.593
make sure he was okay,

13:25.681 --> 13:28.923
and to make sure no one else
had been switched.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.099
- You knew that Skip
and Jeffrey

13:31.186 --> 13:33.051
could do that to other people.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.934
- We hoped
it wouldn't happen again.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.981
But, uh, obviously...

13:39.069 --> 13:40.650
then when you showed up,

13:40.737 --> 13:42.773
talking about
those two brothers,

13:42.864 --> 13:44.525
the one from Haven
and the other from Manteo--

13:44.616 --> 13:47.824
- Skip must have overheard
and panicked,

13:47.911 --> 13:50.243
accidentally jacking up
the Troubles

13:50.330 --> 13:51.740
so it began affecting
other people.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.665
- And since the two brothers
are connected,

13:54.751 --> 13:56.491
Jeffrey's Trouble
was activated too.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.794
- Next thing you know,
there's a message on my desk.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.382
Someone had called from Haven.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.424
- I only called to let them know
Jeffrey was all right.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.500
- It's okay.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.631
You didn't know
what it all meant.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.261
- Skip's been at home
in hiding ever since,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.468
afraid to touch anyone.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.225
- We have to figure out
a way to stop this.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.852
- You can stop these Troubles?

14:19.943 --> 14:22.309
- The Troubles are usually
triggered by emotions.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.440
It sounds like your husband

14:24.531 --> 14:27.864
has a lot of unresolved ones
about his brother.

14:27.951 --> 14:31.159
Our best hope is to get
the two of them together.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.486
- There's a slight problem.

14:32.581 --> 14:33.991
Jeffrey's on the run,

14:34.082 --> 14:36.198
and he's switching people
all over Haven.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.908
- You should talk to Skip.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.834
- Maybe we should see if we can
find anything in Jeffrey's room.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.209
- That's his room right there.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.713
- Thank you for your help.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.838
- Parker...

14:50.223 --> 14:51.633
It's really you, isn't it?

14:53.977 --> 14:55.183
- Yeah.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.352
Yeah, it is.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.855
- That bitch was really starting
to get on my nerves.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.361
I don't know how William
put up with her for so long.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.813
- I know.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.648
It's hard on me too.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.404
- And I know that it's risky

15:11.495 --> 15:14.362
bringing you back out
on a case.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.536
Between you and me,

15:15.624 --> 15:17.455
I don't think Nathan
wants us spending

15:17.542 --> 15:18.998
that much time together.

15:19.086 --> 15:23.705
- Well, In I think we can both
understand why.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.917
- Yeah.

15:29.805 --> 15:32.717
We're here now.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.639
What else can we do?
How can we help?

15:36.645 --> 15:39.762
- Can you take off
this stun belt, please?

15:39.856 --> 15:42.268
I think that the pain,
it strengthens her,

15:42.359 --> 15:44.190
but it pushes me down.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.947
- Come on, let's get
that thing off you.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.567
- Okay.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.116
- I swiped the keys
off of Nathan this morning

15:53.203 --> 15:54.363
when he wasn't looking.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.115
(door slams and locks)

15:58.750 --> 15:59.785
- What's happening, Duke?

16:02.671 --> 16:06.084
- What's wrong... Mara?

16:09.553 --> 16:11.885
- You son of a bitch!

16:11.972 --> 16:13.508
Stop!

16:15.183 --> 16:18.550
Let me out.
Let me out!

16:18.645 --> 16:20.476
Let me out!

16:20.564 --> 16:22.555
Let me go.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.812
Let me out!

16:30.824 --> 16:33.315
(pounding on door)
Come on! You need to let me out!

16:37.539 --> 16:40.656
You bastard.
- (groaning)

16:42.419 --> 16:44.956
- You--

16:50.594 --> 16:52.380
(laughing)

16:57.225 --> 17:02.219
You can't do it.
You can't do it.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.098
You're not strong enough.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.182
(laughs)

17:08.904 --> 17:12.271
- I can't.
I can't focus.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.651
You have to do it.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.488
- Nathan.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.821
- You switched.
I knew it.

17:20.916 --> 17:24.283
- You, shut your mouth,
or I swear to God--

17:24.377 --> 17:25.412
- Or what?

17:25.503 --> 17:26.492
man: Hey, what's going on
in there?

17:26.588 --> 17:28.670
- What, you're gonna tase me?
Go right on ahead.

17:28.757 --> 17:29.837
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, thank God.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.506
He's gone crazy.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.333
He tried to cut me,
and he was going to let him.

17:33.428 --> 17:36.010
- No, no, she-- she is lying.
- No.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.507
- she's impersonating
an officer.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.385
Look, she-- Hey.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.842
- Look, right here, okay?

17:41.937 --> 17:44.053
Detective Audrey Parker.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.353
All right?
Right here.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.021
I don't know what happened.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.848
They-- they threw me
in the room.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.354
They locked it.
They took away my weapon.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.901
- Make her take off her shirt.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.023
- What?
- Make her take off her shirt.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.194
- What?

17:54.282 --> 17:56.443
- Take off your shirt.
Show them. Show-- God!

17:56.534 --> 17:59.492
You have to believe me.
I am Nathan Wuornos.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.662
I am Haven P.D.
I am Haven P.D.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.456
- If he was really
Nathan Wuornos, Haven P.D.,

18:05.543 --> 18:06.623
you'd be able to tell me

18:06.711 --> 18:08.576
what the number
for the police station is.

18:08.672 --> 18:11.254
What is it?
It's easy. Go ahead.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.379
- It's-- it's 911.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.880
- Okay, right?

18:16.972 --> 18:18.553
- Okay, just calm down, sir.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.755
- What--
- Just calm down.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.180
- Clearly, I need to call
for some backup

18:21.268 --> 18:22.553
from the Bronco, all right?

18:22.644 --> 18:23.759
Just secure them

18:23.853 --> 18:26.014
so I can find where Jeffrey is.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.893
Oh, it's gonna be a good idea
if I take this.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.315
Thank you.
- You guys-- No!

18:31.611 --> 18:33.693
- Lock him in.
- Hey, no, no!

18:33.780 --> 18:34.769
(pounding on door)

18:37.284 --> 18:40.071
(train horn blows)

18:47.419 --> 18:48.625
- Jeffrey Doohan.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.172
- Oh, no, you don't, junior.
- (straining)

18:56.303 --> 18:58.259
- Feel anything, Dwight?
Does this work?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.463
- Nothing, still you.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.219
- So much for that theory.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.598
How did you switch us?
Can you switch us back?

19:06.688 --> 19:08.474
- I don't know.
Just let me go, man.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.554
Mara: I'll take it from here.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.105
(people screaming)

19:11.192 --> 19:12.773
- Not gonna happen.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.442
- Well, if you don't want
your party crashed,

19:14.529 --> 19:17.236
don't broadcast your address
over the police scanner.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.565
Your Trouble just keeps getting

19:19.659 --> 19:21.615
better and better
and better and better.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.410
Gives a whole new meaning
for "taking one for the team."

19:24.497 --> 19:25.486
(gunshot)

19:32.213 --> 19:33.248
- (groans)

19:33.340 --> 19:34.329
(people scream
- No! )

19:35.842 --> 19:36.831
- Ugh!

19:38.511 --> 19:39.796
Why didn't you switch?

19:39.888 --> 19:42.675
- I'm not a loser.
Dwight: Help!

19:45.393 --> 19:46.849
Somebody help!

19:46.936 --> 19:48.642
- Switch bodies?
Really?

19:48.730 --> 19:52.848
- It sounds crazy,
but it is really me-- Duke.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.103
I swear.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.652
Okay, you leave me no choice.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.650
Normally I am a gentleman,

19:59.741 --> 20:03.325
but in this particular
situation,

20:03.411 --> 20:06.153
I am forced to kiss and tell.

20:09.084 --> 20:14.624
Dirty...
District Attorney Becca.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.459
- Judge Crocker?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.510
(whispering)
- You're out of order.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.089
- (giggles)

20:27.102 --> 20:29.388
(whispering) We haven't
played that game in years.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.148
It is you.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.401
l'll-- I'll get-- Okay.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.154
- (exhales deeply)

20:45.829 --> 20:46.864
I was single.

20:46.955 --> 20:47.990
- You're always single.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.821
- Oh, I'm sorry that we can't

20:49.916 --> 20:52.498
all find true love
like you, Nathan.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.247
Do you ever wonder
if maybe it's because...

20:56.631 --> 20:59.043
Audrey is the only person
you can feel?

20:59.134 --> 21:00.670
- No.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.749
- Really?

21:01.845 --> 21:04.552
Because now that I've been
in your body, I sort of--

21:04.639 --> 21:06.470
- You still talk too much.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.768
- (exhales deeply)

21:15.525 --> 21:17.390
- I'm sorry I couldn't
let out the Trouble.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.316
Maybe we do need Mara.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.393
- No.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.651
It was working.
Mara felt it.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.410
We need to switch back
so we can try again.

21:29.497 --> 21:32.330
- Which means we need
to find Jeffrey.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.923
- I'm a bit woozy,
but I can do this.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.002
- No.
We're gonna wait right here.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.473
I'm not letting my body
get any closer to that thinny.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.764
- We're not even completely sure
that's what it is.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.684
- Oh, thinnies, Troubles,
intolerable weather--

21:52.770 --> 21:54.146
We may as well never
have left Haven.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.307
- Don't you all want
to come inside?

21:58.401 --> 22:01.108
- Uh, we're good here, Skip.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.312
Or should I say Jeffrey?

22:04.657 --> 22:07.399
- Look, I'm so terribly sorry
about all this.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.780
I told Allison I have no idea
why it's happening again.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.408
Maybe if I touch you both
at the same time,

22:12.499 --> 22:13.488
you'll switch back.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.619
- Yeah.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.120
- It's worth a shot.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.349
Oh, blast it all.

22:37.440 --> 22:41.683
- Looks like we need to go
back to Haven to fix this,

22:41.778 --> 22:42.813
talk to Jeffrey.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.519
- No.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.526
How can I face my brother
after all these years?

22:47.617 --> 22:48.982
- No, please.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.863
- No, I can't. I won't.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.111
- No, please.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.492
- You have to
set things straight.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.619
This isn't just
about your family anymore.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.666
(air surges)

22:59.754 --> 23:01.915
(gasping)

23:03.091 --> 23:04.877
- Vince, stop.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.128
- I can't stop.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.334
- Vince!

23:07.428 --> 23:09.214
- Help!
Help me!

23:09.305 --> 23:11.091
- What is this?
- Don't get any closer.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.173
I got you.
Hold on!

23:14.269 --> 23:16.351
- I'm sorry.
- I am too.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.395
But I'm not losing you.
- (screaming)

23:22.402 --> 23:24.358
(loud creaking)
- Help!

23:27.282 --> 23:30.024
(loud creaking)

23:36.249 --> 23:37.534
- (screaming)

23:41.462 --> 23:42.838
Oh, God!

23:42.922 --> 23:45.959
(loud creaking continues)

23:49.262 --> 23:50.752
- Keep going. Keep going.
Get away from here.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.927
- Oh, my God.
(breathing heavily)

23:59.022 --> 24:00.387
That thing's been here
the whole time?

24:00.481 --> 24:01.766
How come we've never
seen this before?

24:01.858 --> 24:05.021
- It's me the thinny wants,
but it almost took you.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.067
No, Vince, I won't allow it.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.521
We have to get away
from this place, far away.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.106
- And we have to switch back.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.363
Being in each other's bodies
almost got us killed.

24:14.454 --> 24:17.946
- Oh, man.
Okay.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.702
Okay, I'll go back
to Haven with you.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.293
Maybe if my brother
and I switch back,

24:21.377 --> 24:22.457
everybody else will too.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.503
- All right, good.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.425
- How is... she?

24:31.512 --> 24:33.798
- Well, the flak jacket
did its job,

24:33.890 --> 24:35.471
but the impact cracked a rib,

24:35.558 --> 24:36.764
but she'll be okay
in a few days.

24:36.851 --> 24:39.433
- What about Mara
and, uh, Jeffrey?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.932
- Well, she took off with him,
but why?

24:42.023 --> 24:44.765
- We think she's not immune
to the Troubles inside of Duke.

24:44.859 --> 24:47.851
She needs
to keep Jeffrey alive.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.105
He's Trouble-active.

24:49.197 --> 24:50.152
- Because if we switch back,

24:50.239 --> 24:52.104
I might be able
to let out a Trouble

24:52.200 --> 24:53.565
that could take Mara down.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.946
- So she took Jeffrey
to buy time

24:56.037 --> 24:57.447
for Duke's body to blow.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.666
So you both die?
- Pretty much exactly.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.162
- Well, I have an A.P.B. out
on Gloria's car.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.788
- She's in Gloria's car?

25:04.879 --> 25:05.868
- Yeah.

25:05.963 --> 25:08.579
- I bought Gloria a G.P.S.
for Christmas last year.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.586
- I'm on it.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.389
- (grunts)

25:17.517 --> 25:20.384
I don't understand
how you didn't switch.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.763
- I don't keep secrets.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.345
I'm more of a "tell it
like it is" kind of a gal.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.022
- Secrets, huh?

25:27.110 --> 25:28.190
That's how this works?

25:28.277 --> 25:30.609
- Whoever you're keeping
a secret from,

25:30.697 --> 25:32.653
that's who you switch with.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.324
It's the most fun with spouses.

25:36.411 --> 25:38.242
- How do you know this?

25:40.790 --> 25:43.748
- Tell me,

25:43.835 --> 25:46.292
what secrets were you
and your brother keeping?

25:46.379 --> 25:48.040
- I wasn't keeping
any secrets.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.417
- Then he was.

25:50.508 --> 25:51.668
Let me guess.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.341
He loved your wife.

25:54.429 --> 25:57.171
That's classic.

25:57.265 --> 26:02.680
You must be aching to kill him
after locking you away.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.101
- No.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.226
I'm not like you.

26:07.316 --> 26:11.184
I don't want to hurt anyone.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.816
Not anymore.

26:15.950 --> 26:16.939
(screw clatters)

26:18.327 --> 26:20.943
- I wonder what secrets
Wuornos and Crocker have.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.706
- None.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.079
- You're not gonna hurt me.

26:28.171 --> 26:29.832
You love Audrey too much.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.915
- Actually, I'm not in love
with Audrey.

26:34.010 --> 26:34.999
(zapping)
- (grunting)

26:39.056 --> 26:40.967
- Remember?

26:41.058 --> 26:42.969
I'm Duke.

26:46.481 --> 26:49.268
- You've been waiting to do that
all day, haven't you?

26:57.533 --> 26:59.740
- We should have taken
that last turn, Vince.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.158
- I know where I'm going.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.076
- (laughs mockingly)

27:03.164 --> 27:05.371
- Actually, you know,
I think he's right.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.868
- Yeah, Skip knows
what he's doing.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.872
- Oh, pipe down,
or I'll stop the car and--

27:14.801 --> 27:17.759
(man screaming)

27:30.858 --> 27:33.099
- (screaming)

27:43.079 --> 27:44.068
(tires squealing)

27:45.540 --> 27:46.825
- Look out!

27:46.916 --> 27:49.578
(tires screeching,
loud crash)

27:55.007 --> 27:57.623
- (groans)
- Oh.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.175
- What happened?
Why did he lose control?

28:00.263 --> 28:02.925
- I don't know.
Vince.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.267
Vince!

28:05.351 --> 28:09.014
Vince.
Oh, my God.

28:19.949 --> 28:23.783
- Well, t-they're keeping him
overnight for observation,

28:23.870 --> 28:25.201
but he should be fine.

28:25.288 --> 28:26.949
- Oh, thank God.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.156
- I know you have hard feelings
towards your brother,

28:30.251 --> 28:32.867
but he is still a part of you.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.209
Gloria?

28:38.301 --> 28:40.007
- Try again, Dave.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.300
I'm Dwight.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.342
- Wow.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.670
- Yeah, tell me about it.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.095
I'm sorry it took me so long,

28:45.182 --> 28:47.343
but I'm not as quick
as my old self.

28:47.435 --> 28:50.677
- Uh, Dwight,
this is Skip Doohan.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.763
He, uh-- Well, she is going
to escort you to Haven.

28:53.858 --> 28:54.847
- We found Jeffrey.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.858
He's anxious to see you.
- Really?

29:00.656 --> 29:02.157
- HoW's Vince?

29:02.241 --> 29:04.402
- Oh, he'll be okay.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.324
And if he's not and we both
end up in the ground,

29:06.412 --> 29:07.572
well, that's all right too.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.699
I wouldn't want to go on
without him.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.077
- Yeah.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.079
Hang in there, man.

29:19.175 --> 29:20.756
- After you both explode,

29:20.843 --> 29:24.051
how long until you think
someone comes to look for you?

29:37.818 --> 29:38.978
- Just hold on.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.560
Dwight's on his way
with the brother,

29:40.655 --> 29:42.020
and we're gonna figure out
a way to switch back.

29:43.658 --> 29:44.989
And when I'm back in my body,

29:45.076 --> 29:47.442
I'm gonna release a Trouble
that gets Audrey out.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.118
One way or another,
this is all gonna be over soon.

29:52.541 --> 29:55.749
(vehicle approaching)

30:20.403 --> 30:24.362
J‘J‘

31:13.247 --> 31:16.205
- (gasps)

31:20.671 --> 31:21.660
- Vince...

31:22.673 --> 31:24.459
it's you.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.086
- Yes, Dave.

31:28.429 --> 31:29.760
Thank God.

31:32.975 --> 31:36.934
J‘J‘

31:46.781 --> 31:50.273
- Duke,
how you feeling?

31:52.286 --> 31:53.651
- Terrible.

31:55.122 --> 31:56.987
- You switched back.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.199
Doesn't change a thing.

31:59.293 --> 32:02.626
He's going to blow,
and you're both going to die.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.710
- It was terrifying,

32:06.801 --> 32:09.713
like a nightmare
I couldn't wake up from.

32:09.804 --> 32:12.216
I can't believe
I wrecked the car.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.341
- Forget the car.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.673
Was it the same vision
I had of the cave?

32:15.768 --> 32:17.929
- No, I was running
through the woods,

32:18.020 --> 32:19.851
and there was this
terrible screaming,

32:19.939 --> 32:21.600
and I was chasing someone.

32:21.690 --> 32:25.808
And then when I caught them--

32:28.906 --> 32:30.942
I'm sorry, Dave.
I have no idea.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.740
- What does it mean?

32:33.828 --> 32:35.443
And why did you have a vision
this time?

32:35.538 --> 32:37.278
- They must be tied
to your body somehow,

32:37.373 --> 32:39.284
like people's Troubles stayed
with their bodies

32:39.375 --> 32:40.410
when they switched.

32:40.501 --> 32:42.457
- Are you saying
that these visions

32:42.545 --> 32:43.751
are some kind of Trouble?

32:43.838 --> 32:45.578
- I don't know.

32:45.673 --> 32:46.833
(lightly knocking)

32:48.467 --> 32:49.798
- I drove up
as soon as I heard.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.546
Are you both okay?

32:51.637 --> 32:53.593
- Remarkably unharmed.

32:53.681 --> 32:54.796
- Speak for yourself.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.474
But at least we're back
to our old bodies.

32:58.561 --> 33:00.973
-Hmm.

33:01.063 --> 33:02.473
- I want to apologize.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.851
I should have told you.

33:04.942 --> 33:06.773
- About the thinny
outside your house.

33:06.861 --> 33:08.567
You should have.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.519
- Well, I never knew
what it was called.

33:10.614 --> 33:11.945
My mother had stories,

33:12.032 --> 33:14.739
but! had no idea
it was so powerful.

33:14.827 --> 33:17.443
- How long has your family
watched over Manteo?

33:17.538 --> 33:19.950
- All the way back
to the 16th century.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.497
- Oh, that's when
the Roanoke colony went missing.

33:22.585 --> 33:25.702
- Schoolchildren all learn
the official story,

33:25.796 --> 33:28.458
but I heard something
a bit different.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.540
- It had something to do
with the thinny, didn't it?

33:30.634 --> 33:31.623
- Maybe.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.334
The Secotan tribe
told my family

33:33.429 --> 33:36.216
that in the days
before the colony disappeared,

33:36.307 --> 33:39.765
the woods were filled
with an odd greenish mist

33:39.852 --> 33:42.844
that infused fear
in whoever traveled through it.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.769
- Like the mist we saw
in the cave.

33:44.857 --> 33:48.145
- Then a Secotan trading party
arrived at the colony

33:48.235 --> 33:49.850
to find it deserted.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.322
The colonists had vanished.

33:52.406 --> 33:53.646
- When the Secotans arrived,

33:53.741 --> 33:55.777
how long had the colonists
been gone?

33:55.868 --> 33:57.358
- They were never sure.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.409
Once the trading party
went back to their village,

33:59.496 --> 34:02.363
they discovered that they
had lost an entire afternoon.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.289
No one could remember a thing.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.833
- The green mist,
missing time

34:06.921 --> 34:08.286
like what happened to us,

34:08.380 --> 34:09.881
except we haven't
been wiped out yet.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.421
And I'm tied into this somehow.

34:12.509 --> 34:16.627
My attraction to the thinny,
my adoption.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.804
- I checked
my family records again,

34:18.891 --> 34:20.973
and there is no mention
of a baby.

34:21.060 --> 34:23.893
Are you sure it's my address
you were taken from?

34:23.979 --> 34:27.938
- I've got his adoption file
right here.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.778
- (gasps)

34:34.865 --> 34:36.480
Vince: What is it?

34:36.575 --> 34:38.156
- This man--
I've seen him before.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.032
- His name is Agent Howard.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.250
He arranged my adoption.

34:45.334 --> 34:47.666
- He wanted to buy the house
from my mother--

34:47.753 --> 34:48.868
Very persistent.

34:48.963 --> 34:50.419
- When was this?

34:50.506 --> 34:53.498
- Ten years ago,
before she passed.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.050
But this photo looks
like it's from the 1930s,

34:57.137 --> 35:00.675
and he looked exactly the same.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.052
- One of the many mysteries
we're trying to solve.

35:09.233 --> 35:10.973
- So did you get the final
autopsy report

35:11.068 --> 35:12.183
on Barry and Hopkins?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.189
- You got it.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.396
- I know you're gonna miss those
doughnuts and cheeseburgers.

35:16.490 --> 35:18.651
- Trust me,
I'm very happy to be back

35:18.742 --> 35:21.233
to my old
lactose-intolerant self.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.364
- You should get those bunions
checked out too.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.490
- Yeah.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.913
Can we just, like, not talk
about my body, Chief, okay?

35:27.001 --> 35:28.707
- Yeah.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.581
- Actually, I do have
something else for you.

35:31.672 --> 35:32.912
- Let me guess,
it's about Cincinnati.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.168
- HoW'd you know?
- Our switch.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.591
We had to have a secret
for it to happen.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.387
So what is it?
What's in Cincinnati?

35:41.473 --> 35:42.883
- Your sister.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.761
- I didn't know
she was in Cincinnati.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.593
- For the past three years.

35:47.688 --> 35:48.643
- We don't talk,

35:48.731 --> 35:50.767
but you already know that,
since you were there.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.268
So, uh, yeah,

35:52.359 --> 35:53.940
I didn't know you were
still in contact.

35:54.028 --> 35:56.064
- You know, I hadn't heard
from her for three weeks,

35:56.155 --> 35:57.395
and you know me,
I'm a worrier,

35:57.489 --> 35:58.990
so I checked it out.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.780
- And?

36:00.868 --> 36:03.325
- Her Trouble activated.

36:06.957 --> 36:08.788
- So, uh, she was shot.

36:08.876 --> 36:12.334
Is she, uh--
She in the hospital?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.046
- I'm sorry, Chief.

36:36.528 --> 36:40.521
- Nathan explained exactly what
the Trouble was-- Secrets.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.607
Couldn't have been
the adoption file

36:42.701 --> 36:46.319
or North Carolina,
because I knew about it.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.404
So what was it, Dave?

36:50.417 --> 36:51.452
Hmm?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.625
Youradopﬂon?
Croatoan?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.498
Your visions are all
tied together.

36:55.589 --> 36:58.581
What else are you hiding
from me?

37:01.303 --> 37:03.715
- (sighs)
The lost hour.

37:06.600 --> 37:11.344
Ever since we were in that cave
and lost that hour,

37:11.438 --> 37:13.224
I can't help thinking

37:13.315 --> 37:15.055
about the other time
it happened to me.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.983
- And I'm still waiting for you
to tell me when that was.

37:20.155 --> 37:24.740
- There was another incident
of missing time in Haven

37:24.827 --> 37:25.942
30 years ago.

37:27.830 --> 37:31.197
- Oh, yes.
Of course.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.156
The day the Colorado Kid died.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.546
Why didn't I put that
together before?

37:36.630 --> 37:41.841
- Vincent, that was the day
I was pulled into the void,

37:41.927 --> 37:43.758
the day I woke up on the beach.

37:43.846 --> 37:49.057
But what I didn't tell you
before was which beach.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.890
Lying beside me...

37:53.981 --> 37:55.562
was the Colorado Kid.

37:55.649 --> 37:56.889
- What?

37:56.984 --> 38:00.067
- Audrey's son,
without a mark on him,

38:00.154 --> 38:01.439
butdead.

38:03.282 --> 38:08.242
I don't remember anything.
So did I kill him?

38:08.328 --> 38:10.705
Did I kill Audrey's son?
- No, Dave.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.952
I can't believe that.
No, I won't believe it.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.953
- But what else
could have happened?

38:16.044 --> 38:17.955
- We'll find out.

38:25.512 --> 38:26.672
- Give up, all right?

38:26.763 --> 38:29.175
She's dead and gone,
so get over it.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.930
- I can't do this anymore.

38:34.021 --> 38:35.602
She's all yours.

38:35.689 --> 38:37.225
- Go ahead.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.056
Leave me with him.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.266
But you've run out of time.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.816
He's as good as dead.

38:41.904 --> 38:43.394
Say bye-bye, Crocker.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.113
- If Duke dies,

38:50.204 --> 38:51.193
you're next.

38:52.915 --> 38:54.371
You might be immune
to the Troubles,

38:54.458 --> 38:55.948
but you're not to this.

38:56.043 --> 38:58.750
- You don't have the balls.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.704
- If Duke is gone,

39:01.798 --> 39:03.538
there's no chance
I can get Audrey back.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.426
That leaves no reason
for you to exist.

39:11.892 --> 39:14.099
- You're more pathetic
than I thought.

39:14.186 --> 39:16.427
You would leave the fate
of blondie

39:16.522 --> 39:19.889
in the hands of the man
who almost stole her from you?

39:21.944 --> 39:23.024
- It's time.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.324
- (grunts)

39:39.419 --> 39:44.834
(low rumbling)

40:05.696 --> 40:07.482
- Duke.

40:08.865 --> 40:12.574
Duke, hey.
- (groans)

40:17.040 --> 40:18.029
Did it work?

40:18.125 --> 40:21.037
- Something happened,
I have no idea what.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.369
- (Mara laughing)

40:25.632 --> 40:27.042
Nothing happened.

40:27.134 --> 40:28.544
You're both idiots.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.045
- (sighs)

40:31.930 --> 40:33.761
(woman sobbing)

40:35.851 --> 40:37.216
- Who the hell is that?

40:38.687 --> 40:40.769
J‘J‘

41:30.280 --> 41:31.781
- Thank you.

41:52.094 --> 41:52.128
J‘J‘

41:52.135 --> 41:55.343
J‘J‘
