I have a ghost.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.395
You want a ghost to come here?

10:46.479 --> 10:49.398
Well, if it shows up,
that means it needs something.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.025
And maybe I can help.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.943

13:06.160 --> 13:09.413
What do you think
about Super Speedygirl having a sidekick?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.624
Slo-Mo Girl!

13:11.790 --> 13:14.460
[speaking slowly] That sounds cool!

13:15.127 --> 13:16.420
[in normal voice] Come on.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.091
-[Shelby] It's Slo-Mo Girl!
-[Isabella laughs]

13:21.175 --> 13:22.259
Ah, neat!

13:31.727 --> 13:33.979
Hello, nice ghosty-ghost.

13:34.063 --> 13:37.942
If you're nearby, send us a signal
and turn on the light.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.151
[buzzing]

13:40.152 --> 13:42.404
Whoa. You're here?

13:43.155 --> 13:47.117
Oh, that was just me.
I plugged in the lamp.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.663
Ahoy there, cousin!

13:50.913 --> 13:54.708
-Great costume, Kyle.
-Thanks. You too.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.211
Why do you have a rat?
Shouldn't it be a parrot?

13:57.419 --> 14:01.507
Pirate ships have more rats than parrots.
So, I brought one Magic.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.133
Good point.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.719
Ver-rr-y authentic! [chuckles]

14:05.928 --> 14:10.015
How's your dad? Still nervous
about presenting the best prize award?

14:10.099 --> 14:11.600
See for yourself.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.936
Where is he?

14:19.900 --> 14:20.818
Hey, Skye!

14:23.696 --> 14:26.156
It's me, Mr. Oakley!

14:26.323 --> 14:27.575
And I feel great.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.286
I am so protected in this armor.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.915
If nobody laughs, the silence
is just gonna bounce right off!

14:34.999 --> 14:38.252
Listen, thank you for giving me
the confidence to try this.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.630
Between practicing and this costume,
you're gonna do fine.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.299
-I know it.
-[latch clicks]

14:43.382 --> 14:46.427
Well, the doors are open.
So, you're on in five.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.554
[indistinct chattering]

14:54.643 --> 14:58.314
Who's gonna win Best Costume tonight?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.858
Oh, I wonder who.

15:00.941 --> 15:05.404
-I know! It's you, my darling girl.
-[growling]

15:05.738 --> 15:06.947
You are.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.992
Off you go. Go enjoy the party.

15:10.534 --> 15:13.329
Oh. Hmm.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.331
Ooh!

15:16.916 --> 15:19.460
I like your costume, Bianca.

15:19.543 --> 15:24.798
Oh, and I love your outfit,
Super Speedygirl.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.092
Who's the sidekick?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.970
I'm Super Slo-Mo Girl. I can slow time.

15:30.262 --> 15:34.016
[speaking slowly] What are you?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.018
Mermaid.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.646
Witch. [growls]

15:38.729 --> 15:40.397
Movie star!

15:41.065 --> 15:42.232
I'm a triple threat.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.860
It doesn't look like a threat.
It looks fun.

15:45.361 --> 15:50.074
And Shelby, I had
a beautiful princess dress for you!

15:50.699 --> 15:55.704
Mom, in this family,
one costume is just not enough.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.333
And mummy and fairy
just went together perfectly!

15:59.416 --> 16:02.711
Oh! Like mother, like daughter.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.546
[Bianca sighs] Oh.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.173
Oh.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.343
Hello!

16:10.052 --> 16:13.889
Oh, Houston, we have no problem...

16:14.181 --> 16:16.934
with your fabulous costumes!

16:17.017 --> 16:20.771
-One small step for man...
-One giant leap for Ponysitters Club.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.064
Oh!

16:22.439 --> 16:23.857
-Ooh, love your mask.
-Oh!

16:25.275 --> 16:26.777
You're a superhero!

16:26.860 --> 16:28.946
Oh, no, no. Not a superhero.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.198
But thank you. I do look great.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.162
Hello. Welcome.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.584
[mimics Dracula] Welcome. [laughs]

16:42.668 --> 16:46.255
I am here to win the prize. [laughs]

16:46.338 --> 16:48.632
Not so fast, mister...

16:48.716 --> 16:51.343
toothy cape guy.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.472
The Duchess of Tiara
has that all wrapped up.

16:55.556 --> 16:59.059
Fangs trump tiaras, Bianca.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.478
Every time.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.188
[laughs]

17:08.277 --> 17:09.111
Billy?

17:09.903 --> 17:12.865
You look... awful.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.326
-[growls] I'm a zombie!
-Oh!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.120
Charming.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.873
Can you guess what I am right now?

17:24.168 --> 17:25.002
[growls]

17:26.545 --> 17:27.379
Huh?

17:28.922 --> 17:32.509
-[in normal voice] I'm confused.
-[groans] It's not confusing.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.387
It's mermaid, witch, movie star!

17:41.143 --> 17:43.020
Oh, a bumblebee.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.773
Bzz-zz.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.363
[rapping] Excuse me!

17:55.616 --> 17:57.326
You can do it, Dad!

17:58.535 --> 18:01.955
Welcome, jadies and lentlemen,

18:02.039 --> 18:04.625
[laughter]

18:04.708 --> 18:07.461
Birls and lentleboys!

18:08.128 --> 18:13.050
To our Epic Costume
and Halloween Dance Party!

18:13.133 --> 18:16.053
-[cheering]
-[Mr. Oakley] We're gonna have music.

18:16.136 --> 18:20.724
And on that note,
what's a mummy's favorite style of music?

18:21.809 --> 18:22.726
A wrap!

18:22.810 --> 18:25.354
[laughter]

18:25.437 --> 18:28.649
[Mr. Oakley] And help yourselves
to snacks and refreshments.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.360
And, hey, snacks and refreshments?

18:31.443 --> 18:34.113
Where does Dracula like to have his lunch?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.824
[mimics Dracula]
The casketeria, of course!

18:36.907 --> 18:38.575
[laughter]

18:39.952 --> 18:42.621

19:32.754 --> 19:34.715
[Skye] Thank you, Mr. Oakley.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.302
The costumes were fantastic.
The votes have been--

[lights buzzing]

19:42.431 --> 19:45.851
-Um, the votes have been--
-[lights buzzing]

19:45.934 --> 19:47.269
[whispers] Just breathe.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.770
[inhales, exhales]

19:48.854 --> 19:51.648
-We got the lights...
-[lights buzzing]

19:52.149 --> 19:54.943
It's gotta be a loose fuse. I'll go check.

19:55.235 --> 19:58.447
This reminds me of those creepy overnights
you loved when we were kids.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.909
-[scoffs] I know. I used to get so scared!
-[both chuckle]

20:01.992 --> 20:05.370
The lights are flickering... a bit.
[laughs]

20:05.454 --> 20:07.915
Not much. It's not a big deal.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.750
We're not scared.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.715
Ghost? Is that you?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.137
[both] Ghost?

20:22.638 --> 20:23.889
Ghost?

20:23.972 --> 20:26.975
[speaking slowly] Ghost!

20:27.059 --> 20:29.811
Yep. Ghost.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.776
Um, without further ado,
the winner is...

20:35.859 --> 20:37.277
[buzzing]

20:38.195 --> 20:40.614
[whines]

20:42.407 --> 20:43.575
[laughter]

20:44.368 --> 20:45.953
Oh, Tiara.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.163
Yes! Ha-ha!

20:48.247 --> 20:49.706
Yes! [laughs]

20:49.790 --> 20:54.253
Actually, uh,
the prize winner is... Grandpa!

20:54.670 --> 20:56.171
[cheering]

20:59.633 --> 21:00.592
[laughs]

21:00.842 --> 21:03.512
-I still don't know who he is.
-He's got to be Irish.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.180
[laughing]

21:08.016 --> 21:09.309
-Was that too scary?
-Hmm.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.061
[both chuckle]

21:11.144 --> 21:14.356
Sorry, Duchess.
Your teeth just aren't as weird.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.401
[cheering]

21:18.777 --> 21:21.446
[sniffles] I'm okay.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.741
-Ooh!
-[man] Oh, excuse me.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.536
I love your mermaid,
witch, movie star costume.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.870
Thank you!

21:29.496 --> 21:32.124
[Bianca] And you came
in a very good costume, young man.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.584
You went for realism!

21:34.668 --> 21:38.338
It's just my work gear.
We're working at Concession 10 all week.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.716
Oh, that's near our ranch.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.260
After I'm done, the electrical grid
will be back to normal.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.595
You won't experience
interruptions anymore.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.723
[Olivia] Interruptions?

21:48.432 --> 21:49.933
[both] Not a ghost!

21:50.017 --> 21:52.894
[laughter]
