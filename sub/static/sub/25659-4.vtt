e tenth message he's left today.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.520
he doesn't know what else to do?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.560
-I'll make myself scarce...
-No, you don't have to.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.800
do understand why I had to lie,
don't you?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.400
He's my brother.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.760
[sighs]

15:55.200 --> 15:56.080
Hey.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.280
-You two need a moment?
-No, we're done.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.000
You've been ringing Eve?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.040
I've left messages...

16:09.640 --> 16:11.720
put in an impossible situation.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.200
Suri] How are we gonna find her?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.800
lake has got the secret services
to help him disappear.

16:21.640 --> 16:25.640
on't care. I made Eve go and see
Blake, I put her in danger.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.600
ook a man out in broad daylight.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.760
do we take down a man like that?

16:29.800 --> 16:31.600
-I have to try!
-For God's sake, Harry.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.440
can't even walk down the street.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.240
We'll do this in stages.
d out how far into this Gray is.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.120
Then, once I've done that,
we'll take her apart together.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
You can't try to save the world
on your own.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.440
can only push your luck so far.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.600
[beeping]

17:16.280 --> 17:17.320
Don't do that.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.600
You need them.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.120
You weren't in the best state
we pulled you out of the river.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.400
You put me there to die!

17:26.280 --> 17:29.200
I put you there to show you
Clayton doesn't care about you.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.160
-Get this stuff of me.
-Eve, stop.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.000
[frightened sigh]

17:40.000 --> 17:43.200
need to break free from the lies
t have kept you trapped so long.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.680
I only know the truth...

17:52.800 --> 17:54.360
because it was forced on me.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.760
[agitated breathing]

18:00.600 --> 18:01.800
[gasps]

18:04.680 --> 18:05.720
What happened?

18:07.160 --> 18:08.400
[imagined scream]

18:17.000 --> 18:18.400
The bracelets happened.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
Why do you think
Harry chose to let you fall?

18:25.440 --> 18:26.720
He blames you...

18:28.040 --> 18:29.640
tting the bracelet on his wrist.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.240
He thinks you cursed him.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.400
He'll never forgive you.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.000
It's not a curse.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.200
It is not meant to be.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.520
He shouldn't blame you.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.000
You're a prisoner to it,
just as much as he is.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.160
at what it's done to all of us.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.160
can't stay here. I have to go...

18:55.200 --> 18:56.360
Not yet.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.160
-Let me help you.
-[agitated gasps]

19:00.440 --> 19:02.400
octors can do incredible things.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.480
You'll see.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.200
No. What's that?

19:10.240 --> 19:11.800
What... what is that?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
[Harry] Ace of hearts.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.600
Jack of diamonds.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Three of clubs.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.280
It's getting worse.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.240
I'll be all right...

19:32.640 --> 19:34.720
Look, let me make a few calls.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.760
I know a guy who deals
with Chinese antiquities.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.280
He's an old friend of ours.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.440
What do I do?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.640
Try not get arrested...

19:43.680 --> 19:46.520
killed or in any sort of trouble
in the next few hours.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.440
[bell chimes]

20:16.560 --> 20:17.520
Arthur?

20:19.800 --> 20:21.040
Arthur?

20:22.640 --> 20:23.600
Arthur!

20:29.200 --> 20:30.320
[sighs]

20:35.800 --> 20:37.280
-[yells] Arthur!
-Agh! I've got a gun!

20:39.600 --> 20:40.520
Richard?

20:41.680 --> 20:43.760
Richard Clayton?
What a sight for sore eyes!

20:44.400 --> 20:47.800
For God's sake, Arthur.
any times do I need to tell you?

20:48.040 --> 20:50.160
You can't just fall asleep
in the middle of the day.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.240
What are they going to do,
a first edition of Oscar Wilde?

20:53.280 --> 20:56.360
one comes in these days anyway.
It's very lonely.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.760
Do you fancy a stiffener?

20:57.800 --> 20:59.200
I need your expertise.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.600
t to oil the wheels of industry?

21:01.800 --> 21:03.640
Oh, all right, what do you want?

21:04.120 --> 21:05.720
Tang Dynasty literature.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.240
Tang? You'd be better off
at the British Museum.

21:09.720 --> 21:10.800
I went.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.240
We both know what happened
to Babs because of it.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.000
I'm so very, very sorry.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.400
Before she was, um...

21:23.360 --> 21:24.560
murdered...

21:26.080 --> 21:28.360
ld me that you'd taken ownership
f the most incredible collection

21:28.400 --> 21:31.200
cient Chinese art and artifacts?

21:31.240 --> 21:34.240
-Myths and legends, and stuff.
-Not me, old chap.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.720
Yes, it was you.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.680
Well, if it was,
passed them on a long time ago.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.400
d... I'm sorry I can't help you.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.200
All right.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.560
No problem.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.120
But just to make sure...

21:55.160 --> 21:58.440
g to get my brother to pop down,
to help us have a look around.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.120
He's a detective now, you know.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.000
I dread to think what else
he'll find in here.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.040
All right...

22:09.400 --> 22:10.520
[sighs]

22:16.280 --> 22:19.680
for God's sake don't tell anyone
I showed you this.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.560
What is it?

22:43.600 --> 22:45.720
Forensics report
on the Morrison murder, ma'am.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.480
Nothing helpful on the bullet.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.360
But you wanted to see it
as soon as it came in.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.320
Thank you.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.320
Has Suri seen this yet?

22:52.680 --> 22:54.040
No.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.000
-No, not yet. She's out.
-Doing what?

22:56.320 --> 22:57.400
Didn't say.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.760
h, she was asking where you were
when Morrison was shot.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.160
-What?
ell, you weren't in your office.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.200
t wanted to know where you were.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.080
Okay.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.400
[Rich] Yeah, just give us
ten more minutes, Arthur.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.080
And then we can have a glass
tever bottle takes your fancy...

23:42.400 --> 23:43.720
[speaking Chinese]

23:45.440 --> 23:47.480
ait, wait, wait! Arthur! Arthur!

23:47.520 --> 23:50.480
sorry! They said if anyone came
for the scrolls, I had to call.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.440
What?

23:53.320 --> 23:54.760
o, no, there's no need for that.
-[shouts in Chinese]

23:54.800 --> 23:56.120
[Arthur] He's a friend.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.000
Leave him alone.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.400
[speaking Chinese]

24:20.520 --> 24:23.200
ou had to follow me, didn't you?
-Oh, no, no, don't thank me.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.040
total control of that situation.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.520
t like when you got Auntie Sadie

24:26.560 --> 24:28.160
that wee girl that beat you up!

24:28.200 --> 24:30.000
t wee girl was three years older
than me and...

24:30.200 --> 24:31.640
that wee girl was a boy!

24:32.040 --> 24:32.800
Yeah. Yeah.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.560
Anyway...

24:35.920 --> 24:38.160
One of you two clowns
ant to explain what is going on?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.600
Okay, you come with us.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.080
What the hell did you do?

24:53.800 --> 24:55.000
He was gonna talk.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.400
He wasn't even a cop.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.160
hought I was doing MI6 a favour.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.560
I understand you're confused.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.520
ed to kill one of my colleagues!

25:05.040 --> 25:07.240
You weren't complaining
when I helped you before.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.280
That was different.
That was bits of information.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.040
No, it was exactly the same.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.800
nly difference is that this time
you saw it close up.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.000
realise what you've done to me?
The position I'm now in?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.560
The lad's gone.
othing to link you to any of it.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.280
I've got an ambitious DI
who thinks differently.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.320
-I can deal with Chohan.
-Really?

25:29.040 --> 25:30.160
Why are you here, Elsa?

25:31.440 --> 25:33.080
I can't be involved in murder.

25:34.280 --> 25:38.520
I've told you, it's all sorted.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.600
Now go away and pretend to be
good cop. You do it really well.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.440
This way.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.760
[Harry] Madame Cheung.

26:22.600 --> 26:26.640
Even when I'm sitting at home,
trying to recuperate,

26:26.680 --> 26:30.400
all I hear are stories
about Harry Clayton.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.640
It's not very restful.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.320
I'm sorry, Madame Cheung.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.720
delighted to see that you're...
feeling better.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.120
You sound as if being stabbed
in the stomach is a big deal.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.440
[speaking Chinese]

26:48.320 --> 26:50.440
machines are worse than at home.

26:53.200 --> 26:57.200
Why are you prying
into our ancient scrolls?

26:57.400 --> 26:59.720
Oh, sorry, that was me.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.200
Hi, I'm Rich Clayton.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.200
I know who you are.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.600
I was just trying to figure out
t's happening with the bracelet.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.200
Tell me...

27:09.760 --> 27:11.440
has your luck changed?

27:11.640 --> 27:16.280
es good, sometimes bad. Yes? No?

27:16.720 --> 27:17.640
Yes.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.600
I see.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.400
I fear this will get worse.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.720
y, the bracelet will turn black.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.400
Next...

27:29.200 --> 27:30.200
you will die!

27:30.680 --> 27:33.680
-What?
-You still have time, Harry.

27:35.160 --> 27:39.000
Get the second bracelet to me
as we agreed...

27:39.440 --> 27:41.800
and I will remove yours.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.200
All will be well.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.520
we will all die. One of the two.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.320
You may go now.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.720
I fear your bracelet
is interfering with my game.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.320
-[jackpot alarm]
-[shouts]

28:07.200 --> 28:08.400
So now it's gonna kill you?

28:08.800 --> 28:09.680
Maybe...

28:10.280 --> 28:11.600
But it hasn't got me yet.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.520
I'm gonna get all the evidence
we've got on Gray

28:24.560 --> 28:26.000
take it to the Met Commissioner.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.200
That way, MI6 can't get at it.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.360
You don't have enough.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.280
There's no physical evidence
her to Dan Morrison or to Blake.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.640
It's purely speculation.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.400
-I've got Dan's phone.
-What? Suri, what are you doing?

28:37.440 --> 28:38.640
It's got recordings on it.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.160
an recorded his calls with Blake
s some sort of insurance policy.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.600
They talk about Gray
her involvement with everything.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.720
-I have got her.
-Yeah...

28:49.200 --> 28:50.200
[Orwell] Put it away, yeah.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.040
Just give it to me.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.120
t's not safe for you to have it.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.240
[Suri] Call Harry.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.120
We can take her down with this.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.000
[phone rings]

29:05.160 --> 29:06.400
-Yes?
man] They have Morrison's phone.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.640
Morrison's phone?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.480
-[man] Shall I contact Blake?
-No, no. No, I'll do it.

29:10.520 --> 29:11.720
I can deal with both of them.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.040
[man] Yes, ma'am...

29:15.680 --> 29:16.680
[Orwell] Suri has a plan.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.400
Okay, good. See you there.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.000
So, Orwell's got the phone.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.200
e you a call if I need your help
on this one.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.600
now, I've got this personal rule

29:25.640 --> 29:28.040
t I'm only allowed to nearly die
once a week.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.440
Nearly die? That was nothing.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.040
Oh, you again?

29:43.720 --> 29:47.520
You failed to tell me
that Eve had been kidnapped.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.400
seem like quite the right time.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.720
ake pulled her out of the water.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.720
And you chose to save
your police friend instead.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.520
Is this right?

30:01.280 --> 30:02.320
Yeah.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.600
But I'll find her.
I'll get her away from him.

30:06.120 --> 30:10.160
Now he's got the power
t the other one when Harry dies.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.360
If I die.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.640
There are rumours...

30:17.160 --> 30:20.320
ai Jing is travelling to London.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.680
I'm sorry, Tai who?

30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
You'll find out.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.040
d out more than you ever wanted.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.600
t Eve, get the other bracelet...

30:34.320 --> 30:36.000
and bring them to me.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.560
wouldn't want to disappoint me.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.200
Would you?

30:50.280 --> 30:51.440
[imagined screams]

30:56.480 --> 30:58.520
[imagines high-pitched whine]

31:02.040 --> 31:03.400
[sighs]

31:13.120 --> 31:14.680
My mother was an aid worker,

31:14.720 --> 31:18.600
livering... food and medicine...

31:19.040 --> 31:23.000
to Vietnamese refugees
on the Cambodian border.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.800
She was caught
in the bracelet's crossfire.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.720
Collateral damage.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.680
suppose you could say she was...
unlucky.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.280
I'm sorry.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.520
The evil that men do.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.040
Greed...

31:49.560 --> 31:50.760
The pain they inflict.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.520
But I serve them. It's my...

31:55.560 --> 31:57.680
Your what? Your job?

31:57.720 --> 31:58.640
Your destiny?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.760
Look at you,
ning around after Harry Clayton,

32:01.800 --> 32:04.440
le the bracelet tears him apart,
no matter what you do.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.320
Just like Isabella.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.560
It was my fault.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.200
No, no, that's what I'm trying
to tell you.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.640
She was your best friend...

32:18.280 --> 32:19.440
Someone you loved.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.000
n the end, she became a monster.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.720
Why Eve?

32:26.680 --> 32:27.720
The bracelet.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.000
She wouldn't let me guide her.

32:32.280 --> 32:36.520
now you know that Harry Clayton
is just the same.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.760
He thinks he doesn't need you,
s he doesn't need your guidance.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.280
Why else would he let you die?

32:45.400 --> 32:47.520
ything you've sacrificed, Eve...

32:50.360 --> 32:51.440
You're the victim.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.280
Help me... fight back.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.320
] Steve, you've got Dan's phone?

33:18.000 --> 33:18.800
Thanks.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.720
You looking for this?

34:14.200 --> 34:15.680
That's incredibly stupid of you.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.520
hat has Samuel Blake got on you?

34:19.600 --> 34:23.440
Harry Clayton, I'm arresting you
the murder of Isabella Augustin.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.480
fuck off. You hired Dan Morrison
on Blake's orders

34:26.520 --> 34:27.640
and then you had him killed.

34:27.680 --> 34:29.160
What? No.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.640
-No way, I--
-So you led his killers to him.

34:32.720 --> 34:36.280
was asked by MI6 to help extract
you and Eve Alexandri

34:36.320 --> 34:38.440
lp progress their own operation.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.680
That makes you
an accessory to murder, ma'am.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.800
, you're not pinning this on me.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.600
-You're bent.
-I'm not!

34:45.600 --> 34:48.640
o, what happened to the evidence
sent you, proving my innocence?

34:49.160 --> 34:50.200
You binned that, didn't you?

34:51.760 --> 34:53.800
Yes, but that's...

34:54.440 --> 34:56.560
because I put my trust
in the wrong person.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.720
ecause of that, I'm a wanted man
and Bobby Hayes is dead.

35:00.320 --> 35:03.160
hen the powers that be find out,
er'll be over at the very least.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.440
You're a criminal on the run.
No one will believe you.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.320
[Suri] I believe him.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.600
And I've got it all recorded.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.320
Probably worked out

35:15.360 --> 35:18.160
Morrison didn't actually record
any conversations on his phone.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.560
[Harry] Oh, dear.

35:22.080 --> 35:25.000
o... if you wanna keep your job,
re going to be doing two things.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.280
kill the investigation into me.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.560
I can let it die under red tape,

35:30.600 --> 35:32.640
but what's Blake gonna think
if I just kick it out?

35:33.800 --> 35:36.360
can remain a person of interest
but not a priority,

35:36.400 --> 35:38.720
that's all I can do.
I'm a DSI, not the Pope.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.680
-And the second thing?
ou are gonna help us find Blake.

35:44.120 --> 35:47.680
ad his own man shot in the head!
i] I almost died because of you.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.800
you are still working with him.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.640
I'm not, I trying to tell you--

35:53.800 --> 35:55.320
Today, after a man was killed,

35:55.360 --> 35:57.600
after I was nearly murdered,
you met Blake!

35:58.200 --> 36:00.720
You didn't try to arrest him
or tell anyone.

36:00.760 --> 36:04.000
m walk away to protect yourself.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.480
You are now working for me.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.720
And you're gonna tell us
where Blake is. Okay?

36:13.200 --> 36:14.480
[panting]

36:16.360 --> 36:17.360
Okay.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.080
I'm sorry.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.600
But, yes, I'll help you.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.200
[Blake] You're healed.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.480
Better than you were before.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.240
Go, if you want.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.400
I won't stop you leaving.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.400
It's up to you.

37:40.600 --> 37:44.600
motorbike's been spotted outside
Cemetery. It's Eve Alexandri's.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.560
-The cemetery? Why?
-Her mother's buried there.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.080
-Is she there?
don't know. It could be a trap.

37:50.480 --> 37:51.640
Set up by you?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.600
I keep telling you,
no idea what kind of man he was.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.520
You be careful, Suri.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.400
[sobs]

38:29.000 --> 38:30.360
[brakes screech, car horns]

38:30.400 --> 38:32.560
[Suri] Harry,
you are driving like a maniac...

38:35.240 --> 38:36.400
Red light... Red light!

38:37.000 --> 38:38.080
[car horn honks]

38:38.760 --> 38:40.080
Harry!

38:40.120 --> 38:41.160
to make sure we don't miss her.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.120
Whatever it takes, huh?

38:48.280 --> 38:50.320
g jerk! Look where you're going!

38:52.160 --> 38:53.480
-Sorry.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.720
[sobs]

39:09.160 --> 39:11.200
[Suri] Harry, when we find Eve,
what are you going to do?

39:11.240 --> 39:13.200
[Harry] You can have her,
but I need to explain what I did

39:13.400 --> 39:15.160
e thing is, I don't believe you.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.200
I'm sorry. The way you've been
behaving, I've got no choice.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.160
What? Suri!

39:20.200 --> 39:21.560
When it comes to Eve,
you just can't control yourself.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.480
y I've got to do this on my own.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.240
But Blake could be up there!

39:25.280 --> 39:26.560
Shit! Suri!

39:26.600 --> 39:28.400
Suri! Suri!

39:29.040 --> 39:30.080

Let me make it right.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.560
Harry, stay out of my way.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.320
I've got to take her in.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.200
Look at her. I need to find out
what Blake's done to her.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.160

41:24.600 --> 41:26.440
-And I'm gonna make it right.
-You can't.
