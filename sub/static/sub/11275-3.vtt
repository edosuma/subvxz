                Carla's marrying
                Eddie LeBec.    

05:51.800 --> 05:55.700
Oh, that cute little guy        
with the dents in his nose.     

05:57.600 --> 05:59.600
Hey, listen up, everybody.      

05:59.600 --> 06:01.000
Wait, wait, wait,               
here we go.                     

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
    Here we go, here we go.     

06:02.000 --> 06:03.600
I want                          
to be making a toast            

06:03.700 --> 06:05.000
                 to my beautiful
                 bride-to-be.   

06:05.000 --> 06:06.600
Listen, you know,               
I don't make my living          

06:06.700 --> 06:08.400
using words, so this            
is gonna be kind of hard        

06:08.500 --> 06:10.800
            for me, okay,       
            but here it goes.   

06:10.800 --> 06:14.200
                    Uh, Carla...

06:14.200 --> 06:16.800
                 Well, you know.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.900
              ALL:              
        Well, you know.         

06:20.900 --> 06:22.400
Yeah.                           

06:22.400 --> 06:24.800
            I love you, sweetie.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.700
Hey, congratulations, man.      
    This is terrific.           

06:26.700 --> 06:27.700
                    Thanks.     

06:27.800 --> 06:29.000
     Are you gonna take her     
        on a honeymoon?         

06:29.100 --> 06:30.800
Hey, got any suggestions?       
                        Yeah.   

06:30.800 --> 06:32.000
                    New Orleans.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.600
        I found a great         
     little honeymoon spot      

06:33.600 --> 06:35.700
    just kind of tucked away    
      off Bourbon Street.       

06:35.700 --> 06:38.800
Great food, very romantic,      
  steamy atmosphere, you know.  

06:38.900 --> 06:41.000
                Yeah, I had the 
                time of my life,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.200
 and then Vera tracked me down. 

06:44.200 --> 06:46.900
  Well, if I get any time off   
      from training camp,       

06:47.000 --> 06:49.400
      I thought maybe Carla     
      might like to see Waikiki.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.600
Waikiki...                      
Honolulu, Hawaii?               

06:52.600 --> 06:54.000
    Sure, we'll hit them all.   

06:54.000 --> 06:56.700
    Yeah, right!                

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
          I only hope           
    I can get some time off     

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
    from the Howitzer.          

07:01.100 --> 07:03.700
Sorry. <i>Miss</i> Howitzer.           

07:04.900 --> 07:05.900
                Time off?       

07:05.900 --> 07:08.000
      Well, you'll be having    
      all the time in the world.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.400
        You think I'd be        
        having a wife of mine   

07:09.400 --> 07:10.700
                work in a crummy
                bar like this?  

07:11.700 --> 07:14.100
      No offense, Miss Howitzer.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.200
        It's Miss Howe.         

07:16.200 --> 07:17.300
    Oh, take it easy.           

07:17.400 --> 07:19.700
They're just complimenting      
         your big guns.         

07:21.500 --> 07:22.100
Wait a minute.                  

07:22.100 --> 07:23.600
Y-You're telling me             

07:23.700 --> 07:26.600
that I don't have               
to work anymore?                

07:26.700 --> 07:30.000
You mean, I can just            
sit around the house all day,   

07:30.000 --> 07:31.800
eating peanut butter            
out of a jar,                   

07:31.900 --> 07:35.000
and watching                    
my toenails grow?               

07:35.000 --> 07:36.900
 She's, uh, quite a catch, Ed.  

07:41.700 --> 07:43.700
         Boy, you know,         
I'm gonna miss you around here. 

07:43.700 --> 07:47.300
    Oh, Sammy, I'll drop by     
        once in a while         

07:47.300 --> 07:48.800
to watch all you 9-to-5'ers     

07:48.800 --> 07:50.900
spill drinks                    
on your butler suits.           

07:52.200 --> 07:53.500
So, when's                      
the big day, Carla?             

07:53.500 --> 07:55.600
Well, I'd like to do it         
as soon as possible             

07:55.600 --> 07:57.600
before my little hunk           
of back bacon here              

07:57.600 --> 07:58.700
changes his mind.               

07:58.800 --> 08:00.400
             Ah, no way, I'm not
             one of those flakes

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
        you used to go out with.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.100
             Oh, but listen, we 
             have to get married

08:03.100 --> 08:04.200
                on a day with   
                a two in it     

08:04.200 --> 08:05.600
                'cause two's    
                my lucky number.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.700
Rats. Mine's three.             

08:07.700 --> 08:08.900
                Oh, no sweat.   

08:08.900 --> 08:10.500
    Lucky two, lucky three...   

08:10.600 --> 08:12.900
        We can get married on   
        the 23rd or the 32nd.   

08:15.200 --> 08:16.300
      That's right, honey.      

08:16.300 --> 08:17.300
            Oh, right, right.   

08:17.300 --> 08:18.400
                    No, um...   

08:18.400 --> 08:19.900
             As long as it's not
             on a Wednesday.    

08:20.000 --> 08:21.300
      Ooh, yeah, bad juju.      

08:21.300 --> 08:22.900
                        Yeah.   

08:22.900 --> 08:24.700
      This is going to be       
    an interesting wedding--    

08:24.700 --> 08:27.100
the two most superstitious      
      people in the world.      

08:27.100 --> 08:30.700
Hey, hey, don't say that,       
it's bad luck.                  

08:30.700 --> 08:33.500
    Listen, whatever you do,    
don't make any plans afterwards 

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
'cause we're going to throw you 
 the biggest wedding reception  

08:36.600 --> 08:37.400
in history right here...        

08:37.600 --> 08:38.799
                    Oh, great!  
          ( <i>applause</i> )          

08:38.900 --> 08:40.700
    ( <i>clears throat</i> )           

08:40.700 --> 08:42.799
     I'm sorry, I'm sorry.      

08:42.799 --> 08:43.700
        Force of habit.         

08:43.799 --> 08:46.000
    Not my place to do that.    
        I'm sorry.              

08:46.000 --> 08:50.100
 Ms. Howe's going to throw you  
the biggest wedding reception...

08:50.100 --> 08:51.600
          ( <i>cheering</i> )          

08:51.600 --> 08:54.800
I need to talk to you           
right now.                      

08:54.900 --> 08:56.500
          Uh, wait...           

08:56.500 --> 08:58.700
before you say anything,        
let me just, uh...              

08:58.700 --> 08:59.900
I had an idea.                  

08:59.900 --> 09:01.700
Why don't you                   
invite your boss,               

09:01.700 --> 09:03.400
what's-his-name,                
Evan Drake.                     

09:03.500 --> 09:05.100
You know,                       
he's a sports fan, so I hear.   

09:05.100 --> 09:07.400
Maybe he'd enjoy                
meeting Eddie LeBec there.      

09:07.400 --> 09:09.300
You know, you could             
throw him a big bash,           

09:09.400 --> 09:11.700
impress the pants off him.      

09:11.700 --> 09:13.400
What were you                   
going to say?                   

09:13.500 --> 09:16.400
             I was going to tell
             you to smile more. 

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
    Mm-hmm.                     

09:17.500 --> 09:20.300
            I didn't say smugly.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.200
        Excuse me,              
  I have a phone call to make.  

09:23.800 --> 09:24.900
      Hey there, Eduardo,       

09:24.900 --> 09:27.400
looks like you and Carla aren't 
  the only lovebirds in town.   

09:27.500 --> 09:29.400
        Check out DeeDee        
        and David there.        

09:29.400 --> 09:30.700
    Who?                        

09:30.700 --> 09:32.200
  DeeDee and David Lefsowski,   

09:32.300 --> 09:36.000
      the <i>Weekly Gabbers'</i>       
    <i>odd couple of the month.</i>    

09:36.000 --> 09:39.300
    See, she weighs in there    
         at 480 pounds,         

09:39.400 --> 09:45.200
     and he tips the scales     
    at a mere, uh, 92.          

09:45.200 --> 09:48.100
     But I mean, just look      
    at the love in his eyes.    

09:48.100 --> 09:49.900
  I think that's fear, Cliff.   

09:52.200 --> 09:53.400
Cute baby he's holding.         

09:53.500 --> 09:55.700
     That's her arm, Woody.     

09:55.700 --> 09:58.000
Cute arm he's holding.          

09:59.700 --> 10:01.500
Hey. Picked a date yet?         

10:01.600 --> 10:02.600
                    Yep.        

10:02.600 --> 10:04.400
        Eddie wants to do it    
        a week from Saturday,   

10:04.400 --> 10:06.200
        anytime before 4:00 p.m.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.300
                which is okay   
                with my psychic,

10:08.300 --> 10:11.400
     as long as our auras remain
     in the blue spectrum,      

10:11.500 --> 10:13.400
                  and there's no
                  solar eclipse.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.300
It's really tough               
planning a wedding, isn't it?   

10:16.300 --> 10:18.100
          Ooh, tell me about it.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.200
              You know, I'm just
              a little nervous  

10:20.200 --> 10:22.300
    about waiting eight days.   

10:22.300 --> 10:24.000
                 Gives Eddie an 
                 awful long time

10:24.000 --> 10:25.200
          to come to his senses.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.900
Look at him.                    

10:26.900 --> 10:28.600
             He's absorbed in   
             thought over there.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.300
                Well, maybe not.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.800
        There.                  

10:41.800 --> 10:43.100
The table looks nice.           

10:43.100 --> 10:45.000
Woody, don't you think          
the table looks nice?           

10:45.100 --> 10:46.100
I think it looks nice.          

10:46.100 --> 10:47.200
                     Looks nice.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.000
You think so?                   

10:49.400 --> 10:51.300
Oh, damn,                       
I bet chucklebrain              

10:51.300 --> 10:52.900
forgot to pick up               
the napkins.                    

10:53.000 --> 10:55.700
      Oh, no, Sam didn't forget.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.900
  Eddie brought these special   
  wedding ones they had made up.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.300
"We don't want                  
to get married.                 

11:02.300 --> 11:06.400
We have to. Ha, ha."            

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
        Cute.                   

11:08.500 --> 11:09.900
                You see the     
                little hillbilly

11:10.000 --> 11:12.100
            with the shotgun?   

11:12.100 --> 11:14.700
Yes, he's nice, isn't he?       

11:14.700 --> 11:16.900
But I think these are           
just a little too funny         

11:16.900 --> 11:18.300
for the reception.              

11:18.300 --> 11:19.600
    Burn them.                  

11:20.900 --> 11:23.800
    Did you remember to get     
the cinnamon almond decaf?      

11:23.800 --> 11:25.200
          Yeah, I did.          

11:25.200 --> 11:27.000
        Who likes that?         

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
        Evan does.              

11:28.000 --> 11:30.200
         Everyone does.         

11:30.200 --> 11:32.400
     Excuse me, Miss Howe,      

11:32.400 --> 11:35.500
        I know it's none        
     of my beeswax, but...      

11:35.600 --> 11:38.000
          it seems to me like   
          you're awfully nervous

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
                about Mr. Drake 
                coming by today.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.300
                 Do you like him
                 or something?  

11:44.300 --> 11:46.200
In a business sense, yes.       

11:46.200 --> 11:49.300
I admire his skills             
and accomplishments.            

11:49.300 --> 11:51.100
                You like him.   

11:54.500 --> 11:56.200
                         Boys...

11:56.200 --> 11:57.800
        we're all set up        
      with my buddy Bruce.      

11:57.800 --> 11:59.900
     He can get us the same     
     silverware Carla picked out

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
    from the Filene's catalog   
    for over two-thirds off.    

12:02.000 --> 12:03.400
Oh, yeah.                       

12:03.400 --> 12:05.100
So what's the bite-ski?         

12:05.100 --> 12:06.100
        20 bucks apiece.        

12:06.100 --> 12:07.300
I'll catch you guys later.      

12:07.400 --> 12:09.000
                Say, Norm, there
                isn't any chance

12:09.000 --> 12:11.100
        that this stuff         
is stolen merchandise, is there?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.400
    No, of course not.          

12:12.400 --> 12:14.000
Listen, if anyone asks,         

12:14.000 --> 12:16.100
    we never heard of Bruce,    
we can't find the receipt,      

12:16.200 --> 12:17.900
     and if you run into me     
    up on the street,           

12:17.900 --> 12:20.200
         call me Larry.         

12:21.900 --> 12:24.200
              My mind's at ease.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.300
        So, Sam, what are you   
        concocting there?       

12:26.300 --> 12:29.100
You know how superstitious      
Carla and Eddie are.            

12:29.200 --> 12:31.000
I thought I'd mix them          
up a batch                      

12:31.100 --> 12:32.800
of my good-luck                 
wedding punch.                  

12:32.800 --> 12:34.100
It never fails.                 

12:34.200 --> 12:35.600
             Isn't that the same
             stuff you made     

12:35.700 --> 12:37.000
                 when you were  
                 getting married

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
            to Miss Chambers?   

12:40.400 --> 12:42.800
Woody, you want to flush this   
down the toilet.                

12:44.400 --> 12:45.500
        Hi, guys.               

12:45.500 --> 12:47.100
                        Hey.    
                    Hey.        

12:47.100 --> 12:50.200
Carla, what are you doing       
here on your wedding day?       

12:50.300 --> 12:53.400
      Oh, oh, actually I came by
      to get my last paycheck.  

12:53.400 --> 12:54.900
            See, the bridal shop
            has this policy     

12:55.000 --> 12:56.100
     about their wedding gowns--

12:56.200 --> 12:58.200
    "Fork over the jack,        
    or it stays on the rack."   

12:58.200 --> 12:59.400
                 So where is it?

12:59.400 --> 13:02.100
Oh, I'm so sorry                

13:02.200 --> 13:05.700
that I don't have it ready      
for you right this very second. 

13:05.700 --> 13:07.400
I guess                         
I've just been busy             

13:07.400 --> 13:08.900
putting up                      
every single decoration         

13:08.900 --> 13:10.500
and ordering                    
all the hors d'oeuvres          

13:10.500 --> 13:12.900
and getting a band together     
at the very last minute         

13:13.000 --> 13:16.300
so that your reception          
could be just perfect for you.  

13:16.300 --> 13:18.000
        Could you step on it?   
        I'm in a hurry.         

13:19.300 --> 13:21.400
    Soda, bartender.            

13:21.400 --> 13:23.700
                Coming right up.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.400
              So how's the bride
              on her big day?   

13:26.400 --> 13:27.900
Couldn't be better, Sammy.      

13:27.900 --> 13:30.300
      All celestial omens       
         are favorable.         

13:30.300 --> 13:33.300
 Seems that Eddie and I picked  
    the one day this century    

13:33.300 --> 13:35.500
      when all the planets      
    and constellations          

13:35.500 --> 13:36.900
are in perfect alignment.       

13:37.000 --> 13:39.600
    So either we get married    
         by 4:00 today,         

13:39.700 --> 13:41.900
        or we wait              
      until the year 2042.      

13:43.200 --> 13:44.600
              I don't know, call
              me old-fashioned, 

13:44.700 --> 13:46.300
        but I still think you   
        ought to get married    

13:46.300 --> 13:47.600
          before your baby does.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.400
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )          

13:49.400 --> 13:51.900
         How'd you manage to    
         swing a church wedding?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
            You know, being     
            divorced and all.   

13:54.000 --> 13:55.400
Don't you remember?             

13:55.500 --> 13:58.100
I had my marriage to Nick       
      annulled years ago.       

13:58.100 --> 14:00.300
Oh, right, right,               
right, right. Took forever.     

14:00.300 --> 14:01.400
                        Mm-hmm. 

14:01.400 --> 14:02.900
                  But things got
                  speeded up    

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
    when Nick tried to sell     
     the Bishop his watch.      

14:06.900 --> 14:08.800
Oh, hey,                        
isn't that Eddie LeBec          

14:08.800 --> 14:10.600
            sashaying down those
            stairs, there, Doc? 

14:10.600 --> 14:12.000
             Sure looks like it.
But Carla's here.               

14:12.100 --> 14:13.200
Isn't there                     
some superstition               

14:13.200 --> 14:15.400
about the groom seeing the bride
before the wedding?             

14:16.500 --> 14:17.600
          ( <i>screams</i> )           

14:17.700 --> 14:19.400

14:21.100 --> 14:22.700

                in that anymore.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.300
                     You saw me.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.000
        I saw you.              

14:32.100 --> 14:32.800
    I saw you see me.           

14:32.800 --> 14:34.000
I saw you see me see you.

You're making it worse.         

14:37.100 --> 14:38.900
                     Oh, my God.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.900
    We were so careful          
    about every single thing,   

14:41.000 --> 14:42.400
                and then we blew

14:42.500 --> 14:45.000
    the single most important   
    superstition of all--       

14:45.000 --> 14:47.500
         seeing the bride on    
         the day of the wedding.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.800
                    What are you
                    doing here? 

14:48.900 --> 14:50.800
    I was meeting my mother.    
    What are you doing here?    

14:50.800 --> 14:53.200
      I came by to get my check!

14:53.200 --> 14:54.900
                      That's it.

14:55.000 --> 14:55.700
                 We've blown it.

14:55.700 --> 14:56.900
                    We can't get
                    married now.

        Come on. Eddie.         

15:05.500 --> 15:08.600
         Wait a minute.         
        What am I doing?        

15:08.600 --> 15:10.400
            Carla...            

15:10.400 --> 15:12.500
Look, I don't want              
to give up the best thing

          superstitious as I am.

Well, not anymore.              

15:18.900 --> 15:20.200
And I'm going                   
to prove to you

there's nothing

                    going to do?

day of my life.                 

16:52.900 --> 16:54.500
        Lighten up.             

16:54.500 --> 16:57.000
          Lighten up.           

16:57.000 --> 17:00.200
Carla... Carla,                 
this is great.                  

17:00.300 --> 17:03.300
                Eddie...        

17:04.700 --> 17:06.599
             You're really happy
             about this?        

17:06.700 --> 17:09.300
I'm the happiest                
man on Earth.                   

17:09.300 --> 17:11.599
Listen, Carla,                  
you and me, we can...           

17:11.599 --> 17:13.400
we can overcome                 
any obstacles                   

17:13.500 --> 17:14.800
that are in our way.            

17:16.500 --> 17:20.700
      You're a great guy, Eddie.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.300
          Dumb as a skate blade,

17:22.300 --> 17:24.700
                but a great guy.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.500
    Ma!                         

17:26.599 --> 17:28.099
            Oh, my baby's home! 

17:28.099 --> 17:31.100
        You see? I knew         
        things would look up.   

17:31.200 --> 17:32.400
                What's wrong?   

17:32.400 --> 17:33.400
          Ma, nothing.          

17:33.500 --> 17:34.500
    Everything's aces.          

17:34.500 --> 17:36.400
It's just that, hey,            
when you called                 

17:36.500 --> 17:37.800
about getting remarried,        

17:37.800 --> 17:39.400
I realized                      
how much I love you.            

17:39.500 --> 17:41.800
I just wanted to be             
with you on this day.           

17:41.800 --> 17:43.200
                    And?        

17:43.200 --> 17:45.500
    Uh, and Dad's TV shop--     
         it went under.         

17:45.600 --> 17:47.900
We got evicted,                 
and I can't get unemployment    

17:48.000 --> 17:50.400
'cause Daddy didn't declare me  
an employee.                    

17:51.200 --> 17:52.900
             Well, I'm just glad

17:53.000 --> 17:55.800
            my little boy's     
            here for my wedding.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.300
  What about his lovely wife?   

17:58.300 --> 18:01.200
      I'm just glad my little   
      boy's here for my wedding.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.100
Actually,                       
Mother Tortelli,                

18:05.100 --> 18:08.400
we didn't want                  
to return to Vegas.             

18:08.500 --> 18:09.700
We don't think                  
it's any place                  

18:09.700 --> 18:11.100
for children                    
to grow up.                     

18:11.100 --> 18:13.200
      You're having a kid?      

18:13.200 --> 18:15.300
I'm talking about us.           

18:17.100 --> 18:20.500
So, if we could find            
someone here in Boston          

18:20.500 --> 18:22.100
with an nice house              

18:22.100 --> 18:23.900
and lots of extra room...       

18:23.900 --> 18:26.900
Do you know anyone              
like that, Mother Tortelli?     

18:26.900 --> 18:28.100
          No, no, no.           

18:28.100 --> 18:30.100
  You don't want to come live   

18:30.200 --> 18:33.100
      in my little, tiny,       
      overcrowded house.        

18:33.200 --> 18:34.500
        Ma, it's just temporary.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
                Just till I get 
                back on my feet.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.200
         Hey, if it's a problem,

18:39.300 --> 18:41.400
            we'll find someplace
            else to stay.       

18:41.400 --> 18:42.600
Yeah. I think I saw             

18:42.600 --> 18:44.700
a nice cardboard box            
in the alley.                   

18:44.800 --> 18:46.600
        See, see?               
      What did I tell ya?       

18:46.600 --> 18:49.700
      This is the bad luck      
  I've been warning you about.  

18:49.800 --> 18:51.700
                 Carla, don't   
                 worry about it.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.800
                I mean, the more
                the merrier.    

18:52.900 --> 18:53.900
          Look, I'm going to get

18:53.900 --> 18:55.300
             a major salary bump
             this season,       

18:55.400 --> 18:57.900
    and then I'll buy us all    
    the biggest house in Boston.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.600
Wow. A new house?               

19:00.600 --> 19:01.900
                    You bet.    

19:02.000 --> 19:03.500
                 Now do you     
                 finally believe

19:03.500 --> 19:05.700
             that nothing bad   
             is going to happen?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.200
No. I'll just have              
more closet space               

19:07.200 --> 19:08.700
when it does.                   

19:08.700 --> 19:12.400
Anthony, I'm Eddie LeBec.       

19:12.400 --> 19:13.800
                I guess I'm your
                new stepfather. 

19:13.900 --> 19:16.000
        I'm hoping one day      
        you'll call me "Dad."   

19:16.000 --> 19:19.700
Hey, Nick Tortelli              
is my dad.                      

19:19.700 --> 19:21.900
You are not my father,          

19:21.900 --> 19:23.100
and you never will be!          

19:23.100 --> 19:23.700
            Anthony!            

19:23.700 --> 19:24.800
You only knocked up my ma       

19:24.800 --> 19:26.100
so she'd have to marry you.     

19:27.300 --> 19:30.400
         Ma, I'm sorry.         
The guy was asking for it.      

19:32.400 --> 19:33.500
Come on, Annie,                 
let's go.                       

19:33.500 --> 19:35.300
Forgive him.                    

19:35.300 --> 19:37.400
He has the hot passion          
of his race,                    

19:37.400 --> 19:40.000
and I have the envy             
of every woman I know.          

19:45.000 --> 19:47.400
            Well, this is it.   

19:47.400 --> 19:48.400
        This is the bad luck.   

19:48.400 --> 19:49.800
                  I mean, what  
                  could be worse

19:49.800 --> 19:51.600
              than my kid hating
              my husband?       

19:51.600 --> 19:52.500
Look, it's okay.                

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
He's just a kid.                

19:53.700 --> 19:55.500
                  Oh, you don't 
                  get it, Eddie.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.300
                 He's the nicest
                 one I got.     

19:58.800 --> 20:02.000
Look, Carla, he's just          
being protective of his mother. 

20:02.100 --> 20:04.000
God knows                       
that I think my <i>maman's</i>         

20:04.000 --> 20:05.600
the greatest woman              
on Earth.                       

20:05.600 --> 20:08.700
And I can only hope             
that our kids feel the same way.

20:08.700 --> 20:12.100
    Are you from this planet?   

20:15.000 --> 20:17.500
Carla, here's your              
final paycheck.                 

20:17.600 --> 20:18.800
    Thank...                    

20:18.900 --> 20:22.000
    I might say that you have   
    been a unique employee,     

20:22.000 --> 20:23.500
            and it's going to   
            be very difficult   

20:23.600 --> 20:24.700
        to fill your uniform.   

20:24.800 --> 20:25.900
    Thanks.                     

20:25.900 --> 20:27.300
        You don't happen to know

20:27.300 --> 20:30.500
    any other short, pregnant   
    cocktail waitresses, do you?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.500
     Yeah, can I help you?      

20:36.500 --> 20:38.100
          Eddie LeBec.          

20:38.100 --> 20:40.000
                     <i>Maman?!</i>    

20:40.100 --> 20:41.600
       <i>Tu es merveilleuse!</i>      

20:41.600 --> 20:46.500
 <i>Je ne peux plus attendre</i>       
 <i>pour que tu rencontre Carla.</i>   

20:46.600 --> 20:48.600
               <i>Là voil, au bar.</i> 

20:51.700 --> 20:53.500
            Carla...            

20:53.500 --> 20:55.600
         Carla. Carla.          

20:55.600 --> 20:58.500
 <i>Non, Maman...</i>                  
 <i>Maman...</i>                       

20:58.500 --> 21:01.800
 <i>Eddie, c'est qu'elle est belle.</i>

21:01.900 --> 21:03.700
 <i>Non, non, Maman.</i>               

21:03.800 --> 21:05.200
 <i>C'est Carla.</i>                   

21:06.700 --> 21:08.700
                ( <i>chuckling</i> )   

21:08.700 --> 21:10.200
                Carla!          

21:10.200 --> 21:12.600
 <i>Non, non, Maman.</i>               

21:13.900 --> 21:15.400
                 No, no, no, no.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.700
                     Me Rebecca.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.400
                      Her Carla.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.000
                          Enjoy.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.000
             Carla.             

21:26.100 --> 21:27.700
                    I'm so happy
                    to meet you.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.900
         <i>Non. Non.</i>              

21:29.900 --> 21:32.700
             <i>Je ne permettrai</i>   
             <i>jamais mon fils</i>    

21:32.700 --> 21:33.900
 <i>à marier ce petit souris</i>       

21:34.000 --> 21:35.400
      <i>avec le grand ventre.</i>     

21:35.400 --> 21:38.100
     <i>Maman... Maman...</i>          
 <i>Je ne permettrai ce mariage...</i> 

21:38.100 --> 21:40.800
 <i>noon, avec le...</i>               
                     <i>Maman.</i>     

21:40.800 --> 21:42.800
 <i>O, mon Dieu!</i>                   

21:42.800 --> 21:45.100
She says she has to catch a bus.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.700
             <i>Maman!</i>             

21:49.700 --> 21:52.700
    I get the feeling           
she wasn't nuts about me.       

21:54.000 --> 21:54.900
What'd she say?                 

21:54.900 --> 21:56.600
                 What makes you 
                 think I'd know?

21:56.700 --> 21:58.900
'Cause all you pompous          
windbags speak French.          

22:00.900 --> 22:03.300
        She said she'll never   
        allow this marriage.    

22:03.300 --> 22:05.000
                 Especially to a
                 pregnant hussy 

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
            who's only trying   
            to trap her son.    

22:07.000 --> 22:10.100
      Then she said she'd rather
      be dragged around town    

22:10.100 --> 22:11.600
                by her tongue...

22:11.700 --> 22:15.700
          or else she called you
          a small grapefruit.   

22:17.100 --> 22:20.000
  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,   
         wait a minute.         

22:20.000 --> 22:21.900
        Before you say anything,

22:21.900 --> 22:24.100
                I know what your
                mother said.    

22:24.100 --> 22:27.600
                  And it doesn't
                  matter to me. 

22:27.600 --> 22:31.000
    You finally convinced me    
    that our love can conquer   

22:31.100 --> 22:33.400
            any bad luck that   
            comes our way.      

22:33.400 --> 22:34.600
                      I mean it.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.200
            Anthony and Annie   
            moving in,          

22:36.200 --> 22:37.600
              your ma hating me,

22:37.700 --> 22:39.800
                  Anthony hating
                  you, twins... 

22:39.800 --> 22:41.100
         Every time one of these

22:41.200 --> 22:42.500
                 little piddling
                 things came up,

22:42.500 --> 22:43.600
                 I kept thinking

22:43.700 --> 22:45.600
        you were going to say   
        the wedding's off.      

22:45.600 --> 22:46.700
The wedding's off.              

22:46.800 --> 22:47.900
        Yeah, that's what I kept

22:48.000 --> 22:49.100
        expecting you to say.   

22:49.100 --> 22:50.000
The wedding's off.              

22:50.000 --> 22:51.400
                 Yeah, yeah,    
                 we're all clear

22:51.400 --> 22:52.900
            on what I thought   
            you'd say.          

22:52.900 --> 22:54.600
The wedding's off.              

22:57.600 --> 22:59.800
     But you never said it.
