00:01.002 --> 00:02.879
Previously on Lucifer...

00:04.673 --> 00:05.674
What does Father want?

00:05.882 --> 00:07.509
Someone's escaped from Hell.

00:07.717 --> 00:09.844
<i>I think He wants me
to bring our jailbird back.</i>

00:10.053 --> 00:10.679
Mum.

00:10.887 --> 00:11.972
What are you hiding?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.348
<i>Nothing.</i>

00:13.556 --> 00:14.599
I admire the steps
you're taking.

00:14.808 --> 00:17.143
It's hard going out on your own.

00:17.352 --> 00:18.186
I need to figure out

00:18.395 --> 00:19.604
where I fit in in this world,

00:19.813 --> 00:21.648
and to do that,
I need some space.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.108
You see, I did make a promise.

00:23.316 --> 00:24.693
I told you that
you could stay here

00:24.901 --> 00:27.821
until I figured out how
to reconcile my deal with Dad,

00:28.029 --> 00:29.072
and now I have.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.449
You shall remain right here,

00:31.658 --> 00:33.201
on Earth, amongst the creatures

00:33.410 --> 00:34.494
you so despise,

00:34.703 --> 00:35.495
as one of them.

00:35.704 --> 00:36.621
But that husband...

00:36.830 --> 00:37.789
And there's children, right?

00:37.998 --> 00:38.707
<i>Have you considered</i>

00:38.915 --> 00:39.958
<i>how your fighting</i>

00:40.166 --> 00:41.501
affects those caught
in the middle?

00:41.710 --> 00:43.712
<i>You've been working</i>
<i>so hard to make it right.</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:45.463
You were right, before.
We've been living

00:45.672 --> 00:46.881
in the past for too long.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.299
It's time we get a divorce.

01:09.362 --> 01:10.697
Damn it, Leroy.

01:21.708 --> 01:22.751
Damn it, Leroy.

01:45.315 --> 01:46.441
Damn it, Leroy.

01:52.614 --> 01:54.783
S-H-A-G.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.286
"Shag."

01:58.703 --> 02:01.247
Oh, eight points to me
and suck it, Maze.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.500
I see you have a new toy.

02:03.708 --> 02:04.542
Oh, this?
No, no, no.

02:04.751 --> 02:05.960
This is for work.

02:06.252 --> 02:07.837
It's hard to believe
I've never had one before.

02:08.045 --> 02:11.091
I actually have a rule about...
phones during session.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.592
- Really?
- No phones

02:12.801 --> 02:13.635
during session.

02:13.843 --> 02:14.969
Oh, why not?

02:15.178 --> 02:16.679
These things are
incredibly therapeutic.

02:16.888 --> 02:19.140
1,000 Tinder dates
and Sex Words With Friends?

02:19.349 --> 02:21.476
Gosh, it's more addictive
than a whore's navel cocaine.

02:21.684 --> 02:22.852
Uh...

02:24.813 --> 02:25.814
Fine.

02:26.481 --> 02:27.107
Oh!

02:27.774 --> 02:28.900
Lovely. Gummies.

02:29.109 --> 02:30.068
Love these.

02:30.777 --> 02:33.154
And, do you know,
I've never understood these.

02:33.488 --> 02:35.824
Are they just decorative,
or are they for juggling?

02:36.032 --> 02:36.825
I mean...

02:37.033 --> 02:39.577
Yeah, you seem
very distracted today.

02:40.829 --> 02:41.621
Oi!

02:42.122 --> 02:43.206
Oh, nearly.

02:44.541 --> 02:45.166
Okay.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.085
Sometimes, when we're in crisis,

02:47.293 --> 02:49.129
we create distractions
for ourselves,

02:49.671 --> 02:51.548
also known as
barriers to facing

02:51.756 --> 02:53.633
our deepest fears.

02:54.926 --> 02:55.552
Oh, sorry... right.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.011
This is the part where you, um,

02:57.846 --> 03:00.723
dissect my deep
psychological wounds, eh?

03:00.932 --> 03:03.143
The emotion-charged gong show
of a child of divorce

03:03.351 --> 03:05.019
who may or may not have
broken a deal with his dad

03:05.228 --> 03:06.646
by allowing his mum
to stay on Earth.

03:06.855 --> 03:09.023
Mm. Has the visit
with your mom been hard?

03:09.858 --> 03:10.900
Piece of cake, actually.

03:11.317 --> 03:12.652
Mum's all sorted; not a problem.

03:13.027 --> 03:13.820
Really?

03:14.028 --> 03:15.196
Because the last time
you were here,

03:15.405 --> 03:16.739
you used the word "frightened."

03:18.575 --> 03:19.534
And that's not like you.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.286
Well, turns out Mum's a peach.

03:21.494 --> 03:23.913
Hmm. And the "deal"
with your dad?

03:24.205 --> 03:24.998
To send Mum home?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.833
What, you think I'm scared
of Him or something?

03:27.584 --> 03:31.004
I think you're trying to avoid
the unpleasantness of conflict.

03:33.006 --> 03:33.631
Hold on.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.258
So you're saying

03:35.466 --> 03:37.802
that distraction is a way
to avert your problems.

03:38.011 --> 03:39.429
- No.
- Ergo, the more I distract,

03:39.637 --> 03:40.430
the less I worry.

03:40.638 --> 03:41.890
No, I did not say that.

03:42.098 --> 03:43.641
Well, you didn't need to,
Doctor, I just did,

03:43.850 --> 03:45.226
and it's bloody brilliant.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.187
Right.

03:49.022 --> 03:49.981
Where are you going?

03:50.190 --> 03:51.524
Distraction calls.

03:52.025 --> 03:53.860
This really is a breakthrough;
thank you.

03:55.612 --> 03:56.821
- I'm just gonna...
- Sure.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.207
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>who needs a gun and a badge</i>

04:07.415 --> 04:09.292
when I've got... oh!

04:09.709 --> 04:11.085
Hey, it's a crime scene.
Will you focus?

04:12.253 --> 04:13.755
Well, someone's a
grumpy pants today.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.465
Well, sorry,
I got a lot on my mind.

04:16.216 --> 04:17.466
Yes, sorry, you have,
haven't you?

04:17.675 --> 04:20.345
D-word, moving out of your
mum's, finding a new place...

04:20.553 --> 04:22.722
Yeah, well, I'm a big girl
and I need my space,

04:22.931 --> 04:23.848
and it's time.

04:24.057 --> 04:26.017
Not that I have much
with work and Trixie.

04:26.226 --> 04:27.685
Stress can be so aging.

04:27.894 --> 04:28.811
You need a distraction

04:29.020 --> 04:30.063
from your woes, Detective.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.105
It's a highly effective tool.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.523
Mm-hmm.

04:32.732 --> 04:33.733
When was the last
time you had fun?

04:34.901 --> 04:35.944
Oh... well...

04:36.152 --> 04:36.778
No, seriously,

04:36.986 --> 04:38.529
name three friends
you could call right now

04:38.738 --> 04:40.073
for a drink.
And you can't say me,

04:40.281 --> 04:41.574
your child or the man
you're divorcing.

04:41.783 --> 04:42.700
Well, trust me,

04:42.909 --> 04:44.118
Dan is not on my list
of drinking buddies.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.495
Ah. Well...

04:45.995 --> 04:46.955
- Daniel.
- Hey.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.414
I didn't mean it like that.

04:48.623 --> 04:49.624
She did.

04:49.832 --> 04:50.667
What do we have
on the Vic?

04:51.709 --> 04:52.460
Young female.

04:52.669 --> 04:53.711
C.O.D. unknown.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.171
Another fresh-faced ingenue.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.881
- Truly tragic.
- I.D.?

04:57.382 --> 04:58.925
No personal belongings,
just a, uh,

04:59.133 --> 05:00.760
a triangular-shaped
ink stamp on her hand.

05:00.969 --> 05:02.428
Oh, hold on. I might be
able to help with this.

05:02.971 --> 05:05.139
This is something someone might
find at a "night club."

05:05.348 --> 05:07.058
You know, where humans
go to have "fun"?

05:07.267 --> 05:09.227
We found an abandoned
vehicle registered to Uber.

05:09.811 --> 05:10.937
No sign of the driver.

05:13.398 --> 05:15.316
Password's "Carnal,"
capital "C."

05:15.984 --> 05:16.985
Uber I.D.s are usually linked

05:17.193 --> 05:19.821
to the driver's phone,
not the car.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.489
And now that we have
his number,

05:21.864 --> 05:23.199
by the looks of this map,

05:23.408 --> 05:25.285
our guy is on the corner
of Crescent and Third.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.452
Impressive.

05:26.786 --> 05:27.662
Yeah, it's called
"police work."

05:28.663 --> 05:29.664
Let's solve a murder.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.165
I can assist you with that.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.667
It's brilliant.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.470
Her name's Daria Mitchell.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.265
We traced her credit card
to a small bank in Nebraska.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.517
We know you were
the last one to see her alive.

05:49.976 --> 05:51.561
- I didn't touch her!
- Well...

05:51.769 --> 05:54.814
except to toss her cold, dead
corpse into the bushes and run.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.316
I told you.

05:56.649 --> 05:58.735
I picked her up on the corner
of Gower and Franklin,

05:59.485 --> 06:00.486
gave her a ride,

06:00.695 --> 06:02.322
and then she jumped
out of my moving car.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.032
You just left her there to die?

06:04.240 --> 06:06.659
By the time I pulled over and
found her, she was already...

06:09.287 --> 06:11.956
I'm on new meds.
I wasn't thinking straight.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.292
I just got this job.
I panicked.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.336
"I panicked,"
closely followed by...

06:16.544 --> 06:17.712
T-Talk to the other guy!

06:18.671 --> 06:20.214
- What other guy?
- She used

06:20.423 --> 06:21.758
my phone to call somebody.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.343
Her boyfriend, I don't know.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.053
She wanted to go
over to his place,

06:25.595 --> 06:26.846
he threatened to kill her.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.306
Oh! Excuse me.

06:30.141 --> 06:30.975
Oh, it's you.

06:31.726 --> 06:32.810
Ella's got something.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.408
Looks delicious.

06:49.869 --> 06:51.412
Did you come here to gloat?

06:52.663 --> 06:54.248
I just came to see how the

06:54.457 --> 06:56.959
supreme goddess was acclimating.

06:57.168 --> 06:58.628
Well, I wouldn't plan
a festival of celebration

06:58.836 --> 07:00.171
just yet, my dear.

07:00.922 --> 07:02.256
I will not let this...

07:02.757 --> 07:05.676
spicy chicken casserole beat me.

07:05.927 --> 07:07.470
I'm stronger
than you think.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.555
Glad to see
you're fitting in so well.

07:09.764 --> 07:12.433
Ha. Well, of course
there have been challenges.

07:13.101 --> 07:14.727
Nothing I can't handle.

07:15.478 --> 07:16.813
I'm still on
a sabbatical from work,

07:17.021 --> 07:18.439
so I spend the bulk of my day

07:19.065 --> 07:21.484
at home with the... children.

07:22.110 --> 07:23.277
Factories of filth.

07:23.986 --> 07:24.904
Of mire.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.491
They remind me of you, actually,
if I'm being honest.

07:29.659 --> 07:31.411
And how's that human husband?

07:31.911 --> 07:33.621
I discovered a trick with him.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.332
Whenever he asks a question,
I just have sex with him.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.126
Seems to render him mute.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.337
Hmm. Took me a while
to figure that one out.

07:41.546 --> 07:43.089
As for the rest of it,

07:43.673 --> 07:46.217
for lack of a better word,
it is absolute...

07:47.051 --> 07:47.927
hell.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.889
Well, if it's so bad,
why don't you just go back?

07:52.098 --> 07:52.723
Why?

07:52.932 --> 07:54.434
So that you could go back
to torturing me

07:54.642 --> 07:55.601
for another millennia?

07:56.561 --> 07:58.938
- Sounds like fun to me.
- Yes, these humans

07:59.147 --> 07:59.981
are awful.

08:00.565 --> 08:02.567
They breathe through their
mouths, and they won't...

08:02.775 --> 08:05.611
<i>shut up</i> about something
called gluten.

08:05.820 --> 08:07.655
But existing in this punishment

08:08.489 --> 08:11.159
allows me to be closer
to my family.

08:11.576 --> 08:12.410
Understand?

08:12.618 --> 08:13.453
Of course not.

08:13.953 --> 08:14.954
You're all alone.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.804
Oh. Sorry. I...

08:32.013 --> 08:34.849
I like to rock it old school
when I'm working.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.601
- Know-what-I'm-sayin'?
<i>- I d</i> o.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.059
And rock you should.

08:38.269 --> 08:40.188
I'm sure, studying
murder all day,

08:40.395 --> 08:41.981
you could use a
little diversion.

08:42.190 --> 08:43.357
Everybody could!

08:43.566 --> 08:44.358
Mm!

08:48.029 --> 08:49.530
Thank you.

08:49.739 --> 08:52.116
- What do you got for me?
- Well...

08:52.325 --> 08:54.243
I found a poison
in Daria's stomach contents.

08:54.452 --> 08:55.411
It's called mandrake,

08:55.620 --> 08:57.872
it's like this
crazy organic hallucinogen,

08:58.080 --> 09:00.416
and... you want to know
the really interesting part?

09:00.625 --> 09:01.375
Mm-hmm!

09:01.584 --> 09:03.294
It would've taken
at least 90 minutes

09:03.503 --> 09:04.921
- for it to kick in.
- The Uber driver

09:05.129 --> 09:06.339
had back-to-back
rides all night,

09:06.547 --> 09:08.341
and he didn't pick up Daria
until 30 minutes

09:08.549 --> 09:09.300
before she died.

09:09.509 --> 09:10.885
Exactly.
He would've barely had time

09:11.093 --> 09:13.012
to torture her with
his subpar jazz and creepy

09:13.221 --> 09:14.931
dude cologne,
let alone poison her.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.558
Right. We get anything
from vice on the hand stamp?

09:17.892 --> 09:18.851
Nada.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.562
But tech did track down
that number that Daria called.

09:21.771 --> 09:23.105
Davis Fitzgerald.

09:23.314 --> 09:25.107
Owns some hot restaurant
in Silver Lake.

09:25.316 --> 09:27.109
Food is supposed
to be amaze-balls.

09:27.318 --> 09:28.402
Deadly and delicious.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.029
Mm-hmm.
It's been on my list of places

09:30.238 --> 09:31.197
to check out since I moved here.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.032
Oh, social butterfly, are we?

09:33.241 --> 09:36.077
Perhaps you should, uh,
drop by Lux sometime, and we...

09:36.285 --> 09:38.496
could, you know...
Yeah.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.665
Thanks, Ella.

09:48.798 --> 09:50.883
Well, looks
our murderous boyfriend's

09:51.092 --> 09:51.968
doing well for himself.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.387
Yes, your realtor did say
this is a lovely area.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.847
- I have a realtor?
- Well, I took the liberty

09:57.056 --> 09:58.307
of calling several on
your behalf, actually.

09:58.516 --> 09:59.809
It was a good hour
of distraction.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.144
A) Since when
have you ever cared

10:02.353 --> 10:03.980
about my living
situation, and B)

10:04.188 --> 10:05.940
- I could <i>never</i>
afford this place.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.693
Well, I...

10:09.902 --> 10:11.571
Get the hell off of my property!

10:13.531 --> 10:14.615
Well, you're in luck, Detective.

10:14.824 --> 10:16.242
If this home's the site
of a recent massacre,

10:16.450 --> 10:18.995
you may well be in an excellent
negotiating position.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.257
Put down the knife, and no
one else needs to get hurt.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.633
Yes, the Sweeney
Todd thing's

10:32.842 --> 10:34.135
a bit histrionic,
don't you think?

10:34.343 --> 10:35.386
Oh, you're cops?

10:35.595 --> 10:37.972
Sorry. The militant
vegans next door

10:38.180 --> 10:40.182
been up in my grill
all day long.

10:40.391 --> 10:41.559
I assumed
it was them again.

10:41.767 --> 10:42.893
Come on out back.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.354
I hope you hungry.

10:45.563 --> 10:47.356
Tasty as charged.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.360
See?

10:51.861 --> 10:53.321
We're making artisanal sausage.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.448
Ah. DIY butchery?

10:55.823 --> 10:57.366
Macramé class all
full up, was it?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.910
Farm to table, man.
For my restaurant Ellipsis.

11:00.119 --> 11:02.663
Oh, yes. I've heard
the grilled polenta's divine.

11:02.872 --> 11:04.582
We also brew our own
kombucha, keep bees.

11:04.790 --> 11:05.958
Hmm. Keeping it real.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.543
Yeah, there's no hormones
in this meat.

11:07.752 --> 11:09.211
And speaking
of your meat, Davis...

11:09.420 --> 11:11.631
are blonde Nebraskans
organic or GMO?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.924
Your girlfriend Daria Mitchell
was found murdered last night.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.343
- Murdered?
- Girlfriend?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.762
Is there a waitress
you haven't slept with?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.097
My gosh. Is hipster infidelity

11:20.306 --> 11:21.849
really more egregious
than homicide?

11:22.058 --> 11:23.309
Babe, I don't know
anything about that!

11:23.517 --> 11:24.852
- Infidelity or homicide?
- Just...

11:25.770 --> 11:26.437
Either.

11:29.065 --> 11:31.275
Okay, look, I had
a little fling with Daria,

11:31.484 --> 11:32.151
but I didn't kill her.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.361
We got into a fight
last night when

11:33.569 --> 11:34.820
she wanted to come over,
because I was with...

11:35.029 --> 11:36.113
So you're saying
your wife is your alibi?

11:36.322 --> 11:37.114
Actually, no.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.366
I was with another waitress,

11:38.574 --> 11:39.825
- Oh.
- ...and Daria found out
about that.

11:40.034 --> 11:41.577
And that's what
we were fighting about.

11:41.786 --> 11:42.578
Okay, well, I'll need the name

11:42.787 --> 11:43.954
and number of
the other waitress.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.582
Yes, and I'd like to talk to you
about your herb garden, Davis,

11:46.791 --> 11:49.043
because I was thinking about
taking up rooftop botany.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.169
You know...

11:51.796 --> 11:52.922
Excuse us.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.592
Botany? Realtors?

11:57.259 --> 11:58.803
Look, I get it. I know
your mom's in town.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.554
We're both going
through some stuff.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.181
If you need to talk,
I'm here, okay?

12:02.390 --> 12:03.724
- All right, understood.
- No, now.

12:03.933 --> 12:06.394
What's going on with you? Why is
it so hard for you to focus?

12:06.602 --> 12:07.895
What's up?

12:08.104 --> 12:09.939
Just give me
a minute, would you?

12:12.441 --> 12:13.401
Face chat Maze.

12:15.361 --> 12:15.986
What?

12:16.195 --> 12:17.363
My hands are
kind of full right now.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.864
Right, well, here's the sitch:

12:19.281 --> 12:20.658
The detective is annoying me
with questions

12:20.866 --> 12:22.827
that clearly won't lead
anywhere, so I need a favor.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.203
Favors are your thing, not mine.

12:24.412 --> 12:25.037
All right, then.

12:25.246 --> 12:26.038
What about a wager?

12:26.580 --> 12:27.331
What's in it for me?

12:27.540 --> 12:28.457
Whatever you want.

12:28.791 --> 12:29.500
Your convertible.

12:29.709 --> 12:30.710
Fine. But you need to take

12:30.918 --> 12:32.545
the detective out and have fun.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.754
Three drinks
should do the trick.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.674
Sucker's bet. Easy.

12:36.882 --> 12:37.967
Yes, but you're not allowed
to tie her up

12:38.175 --> 12:39.343
and pour booze down her throat.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.469
Less easy.

12:41.303 --> 12:41.929
Fine.

12:42.138 --> 12:44.223
- All right. Deal.
- I said get naked!

12:44.557 --> 12:45.266
Oh, hello.

12:46.809 --> 12:47.768
Want to watch?

12:49.270 --> 12:50.813
Okay, you were the last one
to talk to Daria;

12:51.021 --> 12:52.440
you're telling me
you have no idea

12:52.648 --> 12:53.774
who she was with
last night?

12:53.983 --> 12:56.819
No. She was having
a girls' night.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.531
She was roomies with
another waitress, uh, Naomi.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.283
Maybe she was with her.

13:03.159 --> 13:04.160
Do not leave town.

13:06.579 --> 13:08.247
So did Casanova's
alibi check out?

13:08.706 --> 13:09.915
Working on it,
but in the meantime,

13:10.124 --> 13:12.543
Daria's roommate, Naomi, might
have an idea of her timeline.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.045
Oh, lovely. Then can we go
for grilled polenta?

13:15.546 --> 13:17.798
Well, I can't focus
on an empty stomach, Detective.

13:20.426 --> 13:21.177
Hey...

13:30.561 --> 13:32.062
Oh. Hi.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.355
Hey, uh...

13:33.814 --> 13:35.399
I just wanted
to return this.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.276
Oh. Uh...

13:37.485 --> 13:38.694
<i>Therapeutic Truth.</i>

13:40.154 --> 13:41.155
So much for that, right?

13:44.033 --> 13:45.159
Are you okay?

13:48.579 --> 13:51.332
One exhalation yes, two...

13:51.999 --> 13:53.167
- none of my business?
- Yeah, listen.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.419
Thanks for your concern,
but, um, I'm fine.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.713
No more false pretenses,
remember?

13:59.131 --> 14:00.591
Friendship
means honesty.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.384
You can talk to
me, Amenadiel.

14:03.052 --> 14:04.845
Apparently, that <i>is</i>
your real name.

14:05.054 --> 14:07.348
It is.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.771
This is hard to explain.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.856
Uh, it's kind of a, uh...

14:16.273 --> 14:17.316
physical problem.

14:17.858 --> 14:18.526
Oh?

14:19.193 --> 14:20.861
And things aren't working
the way they used to.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.114
Oh.

14:24.365 --> 14:26.200
And I-I don't, I don't know
what to do about that.

14:26.408 --> 14:29.411
I see. Well, you know,
it's very common.

14:30.037 --> 14:30.663
I doubt that.

14:30.871 --> 14:31.872
Generally stress related.

14:32.081 --> 14:33.207
It <i>is</i> very stressful.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.333
My advice?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.210
Don't overthink it.

14:36.669 --> 14:39.421
You need to relax.
Try to put it out of your mind.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.257
Maybe have a bit of fun.

14:41.507 --> 14:42.466
- Fun?
- Yes.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.802
Maybe a cocktail.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.221
And before you know it...

14:52.393 --> 14:54.645
It doesn't make you any
less of a man, Amenadiel.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.355
Not even a bit.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.614
Was everything okay?

15:05.948 --> 15:08.242
I haven't seen Daria
or Naomi all week.

15:08.701 --> 15:09.869
We feed each other's cats.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.538
Oh, gosh, I detest cats.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.582
Want an animal to stare at you
with contempt?

15:14.790 --> 15:16.876
Get a cat. Open box
of excrement

15:17.084 --> 15:18.252
in your house? Cat.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.587
Oh, gosh.
Can you smell that?

15:19.795 --> 15:21.797
Foul, incontinent creatures.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.383
That's not a cat smell.
That's a dead smell.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.681
Oh, my God! Naomi!

15:36.937 --> 15:39.565
She's got the same
triangular stamp as Daria.

15:40.691 --> 15:41.775
Same signs of poison.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.778
Well, well. Talk about
a girls' night gone wrong.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.959
Lovely. Why don't we go
up to the penthouse,

15:59.168 --> 16:01.128
and I can show you the original
Stairway to Heaven.

16:02.463 --> 16:03.547
Ah, Detective.

16:04.340 --> 16:05.466
After 6:00 on a school night?

16:05.674 --> 16:07.092
Ella's final
forensic report came in.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.135
Right.

16:08.344 --> 16:08.969
Um...

16:09.845 --> 16:11.013
Sorry. Can this wait?

16:11.221 --> 16:11.972
I mean,

16:12.181 --> 16:13.766
those deaths were
fiendishly tragic,

16:13.974 --> 16:16.185
but I'm pretty certain that
tomorrow, during office hours,

16:16.393 --> 16:17.895
our dead girls
will still be dead.

16:18.103 --> 16:18.938
I just wanted to run a couple...

16:19.146 --> 16:20.314
Good. Saved me a trip.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.899
You, me, drinking. Now.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.692
- I'm in!
- What are you doing here?

16:23.901 --> 16:25.986
- Lucifer said I should drop by.
- But we're working.

16:26.195 --> 16:27.029
No, <i>you're</i> working.

16:27.237 --> 16:27.988
Who the hell is she?

16:28.197 --> 16:29.949
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Ella!

16:30.240 --> 16:32.618
I was about
to give him the rundown

16:32.826 --> 16:33.869
on your report.
Do you want to...

16:34.078 --> 16:35.663
No, go for it.
I got to dehydrate. Whew!

16:35.871 --> 16:39.249
Okay. Anyhow, first off,
there was tissue damage

16:39.458 --> 16:40.334
to Daria's stomach lining,

16:40.542 --> 16:41.794
caused by liquid nitrogen,

16:42.002 --> 16:43.837
the stuff that makes
fancy cocktails smoke.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.506
It's probably how
she ingested the poison.

16:45.714 --> 16:46.715
Well, excellent lead, Detective,

16:46.924 --> 16:48.217
but you just ruined
my ménage à trois.

16:48.425 --> 16:51.762
Second, I assumed that Daria
was at a club on Gower,

16:51.971 --> 16:53.514
and we found an abandoned
building on the corner.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.349
It looked like they had
recently had a party there.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.266
Fascinating.

16:56.475 --> 16:57.810
I'm thinking
it was a rave, so...

16:58.018 --> 16:59.520
Any way you could make
some phone calls to help me out?

16:59.728 --> 17:01.355
You know, you seem to have
your finger on the pulse.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.357
Not the appendage
I'd hoped to be pulsing by now.

17:03.899 --> 17:04.817
I know that hood.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.276
There's a great tiki bar

17:06.484 --> 17:07.861
across the street
from that building.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.029
I know the bartender.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.280
Course you do.

17:10.489 --> 17:11.906
We could go and
have a drink,

17:12.657 --> 17:13.450
ask about the
dead girls.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.868
Yes. That sounds like
a very good lead, Detective.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.371
If you want to
retrace the steps

17:17.579 --> 17:19.289
of two hot girls
on a girls' night,

17:19.498 --> 17:22.417
you need to think like two
hot girls on a girls' night.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.585
With your lady parts.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.005
And piña coladas
in hand.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.881
Oh, my God, I <i>love</i> piña coladas!

17:28.716 --> 17:29.550
Lovely!

17:41.311 --> 17:43.188
So, I was watching
<i>Chinatown,</i> right?

17:43.814 --> 17:44.982
And all of a sudden,
it hits me.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.568
I need to go to L.A.
I mean, do you ever feel like

17:47.776 --> 17:49.278
God is telling you
to do something?

17:49.486 --> 17:50.112
No.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.698
Oh. You think Chloe's
gonna drink that?

17:52.906 --> 17:53.532
No.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.161
Hey, guys. Do you
recognize this hand stamp?

17:59.288 --> 18:00.247
What about these women?

18:01.498 --> 18:02.124
No.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.751
Okay, look. I'm LAPD,

18:03.959 --> 18:05.085
and if there's any info
that you can give me

18:05.294 --> 18:07.087
on any...

18:07.588 --> 18:09.715
How <i>not</i> to get laid.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.176
I'm not trying
to get laid, Maze.

18:13.177 --> 18:13.844
I don't get it.

18:14.678 --> 18:15.554
Well, did you talk
to the bartender?

18:15.763 --> 18:18.015
Yeah. He said
something was going on

18:18.223 --> 18:19.433
across the street in
the abandoned building.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.226
I put a call in for
a warrant to the judge,

18:21.435 --> 18:22.519
and I'm waiting
to hear back.

18:22.728 --> 18:24.480
Great. Looks like you have
some time to kill.

18:24.855 --> 18:25.481
Have a drink.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.107
No. I'm gonna
call it a night.

18:27.566 --> 18:28.442
Hello, ladies.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.569
Hi. What are
you doing here?

18:31.278 --> 18:32.071
Maze invited me.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.031
- She said it's girls' night.
- Yeah.

18:34.615 --> 18:36.909
No. I'm working
a double homicide.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.661
Would it kill you
to just relax for once?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.038
All you do is

18:41.246 --> 18:42.539
work, work, work.

18:42.748 --> 18:43.791
Wow. Like you're one to talk.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.001
You're at Lucifer's
beck and call 24/7.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.669
It's like you're
his personal concierge.

18:47.878 --> 18:50.631
I'm not his personal
anything, anymore.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.634
Hmm. Well, you basically still
live there, and it's not like

18:53.842 --> 18:55.135
he's pouring <i>you</i> any drinks.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.138
Least I know how to have fun.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.390
What about pleasure?

19:01.475 --> 19:02.267
Men?

19:03.435 --> 19:05.145
When's the last time
you had sex?

19:05.395 --> 19:06.563
Hey, why does everything
always have to be

19:06.772 --> 19:08.398
- about work or sex?
- Yeah, I agree.

19:08.607 --> 19:12.111
Girls' night, done right,
is about female bonding.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.404
- Exactly.
- Really getting
to know each other.

19:14.613 --> 19:18.117
Sharing problems,
origin stories, secrets.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.785
- Can't we just drink?
- Fine.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.787
I'll start. Um...

19:22.287 --> 19:23.914
I worked my way
through med school as

19:24.123 --> 19:25.791
a phone sex operator.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.794
1-800-ProfessorFeelGood.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.046
I would totally
call that.

19:31.255 --> 19:32.047
Nice.

19:32.256 --> 19:33.423
I'm Ella, by the way.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.801
- I love that we just
skipped the small talk.
- Yes.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.178
Um, okay. I'll go next,
I guess. Um...

19:38.387 --> 19:39.513
I used to steal cars.

19:41.348 --> 19:41.974
Who's next?

19:42.432 --> 19:43.976
I was forged in
the bowels of Hell

19:44.184 --> 19:46.478
to torture the guilty
for all of eternity.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.189
Interesting share.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.191
Okay, so...

19:51.567 --> 19:52.526
Now, you go, Chloe.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.278
Female trust.

19:55.070 --> 19:55.696
Come on.

19:55.904 --> 19:56.738
What's on your mind?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.740
What's on my mind...

19:58.949 --> 20:00.701
like, other than the case?

20:01.493 --> 20:02.119
Yeah.

20:05.789 --> 20:06.540
Um...

20:08.542 --> 20:09.668
A little divorce.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.003
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.297
Single parenthood...

20:15.215 --> 20:17.926
uh, possible homelessness and...

20:18.677 --> 20:21.889
most likely many, many cats
in my future.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.724
Or things
that require batteries.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.058
Okay, you know,
that's-that's...

20:25.267 --> 20:26.393
that's what I'm talking about.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.062
You guys,
this is so fun!

20:29.271 --> 20:30.189
- Is it?
- Yes!

20:30.397 --> 20:32.566
Yeah, uh, tequila, stat.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.234
- Yes.
- Keep 'em coming!

20:34.443 --> 20:35.652
This is really
gonna help you feel,

20:35.861 --> 20:37.237
you know, anything.

20:41.158 --> 20:41.783
Ugh!

20:41.992 --> 20:43.160
Cosmopolitan?

20:43.368 --> 20:45.078
Perhaps this really
<i>is</i> girls' night.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.915
There are only two reasons
to drink alone, brother.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.708
Either you're a chronic dullard,

20:49.917 --> 20:51.460
or you're trying
to avoid your problems.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.878
If it's the
latter, I approve.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.713
My problems
<i>are</i> your problems.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.382
Ooh! Aren't we
the little empath?

20:57.716 --> 21:00.677
You think letting Mom stay here
on earth doesn't affect us all?

21:01.720 --> 21:02.804
Why? Because you think Dad is gonna

21:03.013 --> 21:04.890
forgive and forget about
the fact that you broke a deal?

21:05.098 --> 21:06.350
Haven't broken anything.

21:06.558 --> 21:07.476
I found a loophole.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.353
As such, I'm not thinking
about it at all.

21:09.561 --> 21:10.354
You should try it.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.231
There will be consequences!

21:14.900 --> 21:15.776
I don't get it.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.778
If you're so concerned,
why don't you just

21:17.986 --> 21:19.154
fly Mum back to Hell?

21:19.947 --> 21:21.657
Because I can't!

21:23.533 --> 21:25.077
That was a tad dramatic.

21:25.285 --> 21:25.911
Why not?

21:26.286 --> 21:27.287
It's complicated.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.666
Never fear,
fun brother's here.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.918
I'm gonna show you the magic
of distraction.

21:33.085 --> 21:35.045
But no more girly drinks.
All right?

21:36.004 --> 21:37.005
Cosmos are yummy.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.259
Oh... Bourbon. Stat.
Keep 'em coming.

21:53.981 --> 21:54.773
Yes!

21:54.982 --> 21:57.109
Thank you, Los Angeles!

22:01.321 --> 22:02.698
And then Lucifer's
all like...

22:03.323 --> 22:05.826
"Hey Chloe,
name three friends

22:06.034 --> 22:08.954
that you could go call
and have a drink with."

22:09.162 --> 22:10.455
- So smug, you know?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:10.664 --> 22:12.791
Well, one...two...three!

22:13.000 --> 22:13.667
So, you're saying,

22:13.875 --> 22:15.002
if I called you guys,

22:15.585 --> 22:16.586
you would drop everything

22:16.795 --> 22:18.088
and come and have
a drink with me?

22:18.297 --> 22:20.465
Mm-hmm. 'Cause that is what
girlfriends do for each other.

22:20.674 --> 22:22.676
Yes, especially during
tough times.

22:22.884 --> 22:23.677
Exactly.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.096
I've never had friends
like that.

22:26.763 --> 22:27.514
Like, ever.

22:27.723 --> 22:29.057
Well, you're a lot
more tolerable

22:29.266 --> 22:30.183
when you're drunk,
Decker.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.435
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

22:31.643 --> 22:32.811
And then Lucifer's like,

22:33.020 --> 22:35.981
"You use work to avoid
having fun."

22:36.189 --> 22:37.566
Oh, yeah.
Well, not anymore, lady.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.067
'Cause we're your tribe, now.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.403
And we like to party!

22:42.904 --> 22:45.115
I wish I had my knives.
We could have made a blood pact.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.366
- Ooh, next time.
- Aww...
- Yeah, yeah.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.201
Next time?
This is progress.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.411
To tribes!

22:49.619 --> 22:51.204
To tribes!

22:52.164 --> 22:52.998
Sip it.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.209
I think we should go back
up there.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.378
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

22:59.254 --> 23:00.339
Mm.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.176
Oh, it looks like
someone's made a fourth friend.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.553
Oh, you get it, girl!

23:06.762 --> 23:08.055
Oh, no!

23:08.263 --> 23:10.307
- Abort! Chloe!
- Oh... don't do that.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.892
I don't
think she...

23:12.100 --> 23:13.477
Does she wear contacts?

23:13.685 --> 23:15.062
She's really into him.
And she's bringing
him over.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.313
- Is she?
- Look!

23:17.439 --> 23:18.231
Same hand stamp

23:18.440 --> 23:19.316
as Daria
and Naomi!

23:19.524 --> 23:20.484
Where did you get this?

23:20.692 --> 23:22.444
I saw some
hot women, uh,

23:22.652 --> 23:24.613
g-going into a party
across the street last night.

23:24.821 --> 23:25.781
- Okay.
- It was just...

23:25.989 --> 23:26.907
Do you recognize these women?

23:27.115 --> 23:27.824
Did you see
these girls there?

23:29.201 --> 23:29.910
What's your deal?

23:30.118 --> 23:31.828
Hey, she's just asking
a few questions.

23:32.037 --> 23:34.122
Well, he's taken.
So back off, skank!

23:34.331 --> 23:35.374
- I...
- Hey!

23:35.582 --> 23:37.959
No one calls my skank a skank.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.503
I'm hurting her.
No!
Oh, no, no...

23:39.711 --> 23:41.213
- No.
- Okay, no. No, no, Maze.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.506
Maze...

23:42.714 --> 23:44.299
Wipe that smile
off her face.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.760
Maze, remember...
aggression

23:46.968 --> 23:48.261
is not the answer, okay.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.930
Clearly, this woman is having

23:50.138 --> 23:51.264
some serious
trust issues.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.224
Clearly.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.101
Or maybe she's just
a raging bitch.

23:54.309 --> 23:55.185
Oh!

24:10.450 --> 24:12.369
LAPD! Hey!

24:12.577 --> 24:14.121
Everybody take a breath!

24:14.329 --> 24:16.373
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

24:17.082 --> 24:17.874
What is happening?!

24:24.548 --> 24:25.465
Maze, Maze, Maze!

24:29.136 --> 24:30.637
Maze, I wasn't done
questioning him!

24:34.474 --> 24:35.267
Ugh!

24:37.436 --> 24:38.395
Carry on.

24:38.979 --> 24:39.646
Hey.

24:40.147 --> 24:41.356
Did you see these girls?

24:42.023 --> 24:42.691
Yeah, maybe.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.151
- Where?
- It was-- it was--

24:44.359 --> 24:45.735
- Where?!
- It was a crowded
sex club,

24:46.278 --> 24:47.279
and there was so many
hot girls...

24:47.487 --> 24:48.405
A sex club?

24:48.780 --> 24:49.781
Yeah, just...

24:51.366 --> 24:52.993
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Just...

24:56.788 --> 24:58.665
Girls' night out.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.177
Oh...

25:10.677 --> 25:13.054
Oof. Happy hour
over already?

25:13.472 --> 25:14.514
Must have been
some party.

25:15.015 --> 25:15.849
Yeah...

25:16.057 --> 25:17.851
other than the half hour-ish

25:18.059 --> 25:20.187
from 8:47 to 9:17

25:20.395 --> 25:22.022
that I can't quite remember
anything.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.274
Classic Chloe.

25:24.483 --> 25:25.817
Only you would make a point
of remembering

25:26.026 --> 25:27.944
the exact amount of time
you can't remember.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.613
Mm. Well,

25:29.821 --> 25:32.240
I was lucid enough to
destroy a tiki bar

25:32.449 --> 25:34.701
and get a lead
on our two dead blondes.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.870
I found a guy with a hand stamp.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.788
The same club that
Daria and Naomi went to?

25:40.248 --> 25:41.166
Not a club.

25:41.374 --> 25:45.295
More like a roving,
pop-up sex party.

25:45.504 --> 25:46.963
Secretive,
invite-only,

25:47.172 --> 25:49.216
caters to rich jerks
who like to pay for it.

25:49.424 --> 25:50.050
So gross.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.760
So those two girls
were sex workers?

25:53.178 --> 25:53.803
Looks like it.

25:54.012 --> 25:55.430
But the only way
to know for sure

25:55.639 --> 25:57.224
is to get you
into the next shindig.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.100
Which hand stamp guy told me--

25:59.643 --> 26:00.560
right before he passed out--

26:01.353 --> 26:02.521
is happening as we speak.

26:03.522 --> 26:04.147
Me?

26:04.773 --> 26:06.983
Uh-huh. Men only.
And I got you a date.

26:08.443 --> 26:09.277
- Nope.
- Yes.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.862
- Mm-mm. No way.
- Yes.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.489
It's good to have Lucifer
there with you as back up.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.157
So they don't think
you're a cop.

26:16.701 --> 26:17.827
I don't look like a cop.

26:19.829 --> 26:20.956
Uh-huh.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.251
Hey.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.418
Do I look like a cop?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.843
Ah. Finally, you're here. Right.

26:34.302 --> 26:35.262
I promise this will be more fun

26:35.470 --> 26:36.972
than light beers
and <i>Bachelor</i> reruns.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.557
Your jokes
never get old.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.850
Oh, come on, who doesn't
love a sex party?

26:41.059 --> 26:41.685
Then again, if you're me,

26:41.893 --> 26:43.520
every party's a sex party
of sorts.

26:43.728 --> 26:44.646
It's illegal, for starters.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.273
Why do you think they
change the location every night?

26:46.773 --> 26:48.233
No liquor license,
underage girls...

26:48.441 --> 26:49.734
Well, the world's
oldest profession

26:49.943 --> 26:51.611
seems to be surviving
quite nicely.

26:51.820 --> 26:52.946
Hello, chaps.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.782
Yes, my first startup
was a sex club, actually.

26:55.991 --> 26:57.617
Little place called "Eden".
Perhaps you've heard of it?

26:57.826 --> 26:59.619
I'm... good.
Thank you.

27:01.079 --> 27:03.039
Best case scenario,
this club exploits women.

27:03.248 --> 27:04.958
Worst case? It got those girls
a belly full of poison.

27:05.166 --> 27:05.959
Mm.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.003
- One other thing.
- Hm?

27:08.420 --> 27:10.046
I'm not sure
why he's here.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.258
Only dullards drink alone.

27:13.466 --> 27:14.968
Yes, he's a tad anxious
these days.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.469
I thought a night out
would do him good.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.221
Right. Well,
we have one mission:

27:18.930 --> 27:20.473
to find out who
knew the dead girls.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.726
And remember--
we're undercover, okay?

27:22.934 --> 27:25.186
As if you could look like
anything other than a cop.

27:25.395 --> 27:26.521
I do not look like a cop!

27:27.022 --> 27:27.689
Cop.

27:30.358 --> 27:31.818
All right, will you guys
just please,

27:32.027 --> 27:33.361
for God's sake, be chill?

27:33.945 --> 27:36.239
no drinking, no touching...

27:36.823 --> 27:38.491
...and just keep everything
low-key.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.952
Yes!

27:41.161 --> 27:43.538
Oh, my God.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.166
This is not helping us find out
who knew the dead girls.

27:46.374 --> 27:48.501
Agreed. His shimmy is
a tad off-putting.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.836
Come on, Luci!

27:50.045 --> 27:51.838
Come cut a rug
with your big bro!

27:52.047 --> 27:53.006
Uh. No, no,
no, no, no.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.341
White man's overbite,

27:54.549 --> 27:55.925
that is definitely
where I draw the line.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.218
Hold on a second.

27:57.427 --> 27:58.511
Look at the bar.

28:00.722 --> 28:01.765
It's liquid nitrogen.

28:01.973 --> 28:03.141
It's the same thing
that caused damage

28:03.350 --> 28:04.684
to Daria Mitchell's
stomach lining.

28:04.893 --> 28:05.852
Yes.

28:08.229 --> 28:09.064
Hey, buddy.

28:09.272 --> 28:09.939
Hey.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.650
What do you know
about these two girls?

28:16.071 --> 28:17.572
Not so fast,
buddy boy.

28:17.781 --> 28:20.367
Seems my martini isn't the
only thing here that's dirty.

28:20.575 --> 28:21.993
Mmm.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.495
A drink to savor,
don't you think?

28:23.703 --> 28:25.121
Ah...

28:25.330 --> 28:26.706
Want to explain
why you ran?

28:27.749 --> 28:29.250
Come on.
You're obviously a cop.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.919
Shut it.

28:31.127 --> 28:32.504
I figured you were
here to bust me.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.381
Yes, we are
here to bust you.

28:34.589 --> 28:36.966
For the untimely fate of
two innocent Nebraskan girls.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.010
Wait... what?

28:39.260 --> 28:40.178
It's funny
how killers go deaf

28:40.387 --> 28:41.638
at the moment of reckoning,
isn't it?

28:41.846 --> 28:42.639
No, no. I...

28:43.098 --> 28:44.099
I'm no killer.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.559
I-I-I keep an eye on
the girls that work here

28:47.018 --> 28:48.436
and serve the pervs drinks.

28:48.853 --> 28:49.646
And pot...

28:50.605 --> 28:51.439
Maybe a bit of "E."

28:51.648 --> 28:53.650
- What about mandrake?
- Who's Mandrake?

28:53.858 --> 28:56.027
Did you put poison in these
two girls' drinks?

28:56.361 --> 28:58.697
No-no. What? No.
I-I remember these girls.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.740
Their drinks were clean
when I made 'em.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.242
Who was paying for 'em?

29:02.450 --> 29:05.328
I don't know, it was some
Hollywood dirtbag with a gold card.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.706
You'll need to be
a little more specific.

29:08.373 --> 29:10.417
It's... Yuri something.

29:10.625 --> 29:11.668
He's not here
tonight though.

29:12.836 --> 29:13.670
I guess your two dead girls

29:13.878 --> 29:15.004
and the other blonde must have
really worn him out.

29:15.213 --> 29:15.839
Wait a minute.

29:16.047 --> 29:17.048
- There were <i>three</i> blondes?
- Yeah.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.550
Your two newbies

29:18.758 --> 29:19.592
and their hot friend.

29:19.801 --> 29:20.468
Right. First name:

29:20.677 --> 29:21.928
"Hot", last name "Friend"?

29:22.262 --> 29:24.013
They don't use
their real names.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.765
She's one of our
regulars though.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.684
You know, life of the party.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.102
Oh, she won't be
the life of anything,

29:29.310 --> 29:31.229
if we don't get to her before
lady killer Yuri has his way.

29:31.521 --> 29:32.439
If he hasn't already.

29:32.647 --> 29:33.523
Thank you.

29:38.111 --> 29:39.446
Oh, silly me.

29:41.990 --> 29:43.783
Come on. Rise and shine,
Crantini.

29:43.992 --> 29:44.868
Time to go.

29:45.076 --> 29:46.161
Yeah.
Let's do this.

29:51.124 --> 29:52.292
Gosh, I wish I got that
on video.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.501
Oh, I can get that
on video!

29:53.710 --> 29:55.128
Hold on.
Douche-cam.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.272
Must have been some party.

30:14.731 --> 30:16.107
Ah, that's funny.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.443
And I'll laugh after we find
this Yuri scumbag.

30:19.027 --> 30:20.278
You have anything
on the third girl?

30:20.487 --> 30:22.322
Bartender said she was,
"Blonde, hot,

30:22.530 --> 30:23.448
and had an exposed midriff".

30:23.656 --> 30:25.950
Which describes half
the population of L.A.

30:26.159 --> 30:26.868
Well, the chef's wife,

30:27.076 --> 30:28.077
Gisele, fits
that description.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.455
Yeah, but when you saw her,
she was healthy.

30:30.663 --> 30:31.831
You think she could have
worked with Naomi

30:32.040 --> 30:33.166
and Daria
at the sex club?

30:34.167 --> 30:34.793
She knew them

30:35.001 --> 30:36.211
through her husband's
restaurant.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.171
I mean, but part-time
sex worker?

30:38.379 --> 30:40.340
Would that be the first thing
you put on your résumé?

30:40.840 --> 30:42.342
No. But if she was there,

30:42.550 --> 30:44.385
she was witness to everything
that went down that night.

30:45.386 --> 30:46.679
So, maybe Yuri's after her.

30:46.888 --> 30:47.972
Yeah, well, the tech
got Yuri's info

30:48.181 --> 30:49.724
from the credit card
he used at the sex party.

30:49.933 --> 30:50.975
Only has a P.O. box.

30:51.184 --> 30:53.269
No home address, but I did get
a cell and a plate number.

30:53.478 --> 30:54.103
Okay, good.

30:54.312 --> 30:55.480
Lucifer and I
will go find Yuri,

30:55.688 --> 30:56.648
and, uh,

30:57.357 --> 30:58.233
and, um...

30:58.441 --> 31:00.026
...you track down Gisele.

31:02.779 --> 31:03.404
Oh...

31:03.613 --> 31:04.364
Copy that.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.574
That is...

31:08.660 --> 31:10.036
What did Maze win

31:10.245 --> 31:12.372
and why does it involve
my tragic drunk face?

31:12.580 --> 31:13.665
Just a little wager.

31:14.582 --> 31:15.458
Well, you had a lot
on your mind,

31:15.667 --> 31:16.960
so I decided
to distract you,

31:17.627 --> 31:18.545
with "girls' night."

31:21.214 --> 31:22.173
Last night was a setup?

31:22.382 --> 31:24.092
Yes. Well, you had fun,
didn't you?

31:24.300 --> 31:25.260
You should be
thanking me.

31:28.513 --> 31:29.430
What are you doing?

31:30.723 --> 31:31.850
Detective...

31:39.190 --> 31:40.316
Uh, hey, Davis
hasn't seen Gisele,

31:40.608 --> 31:42.151
and she's, uh,
not answering her cell,

31:42.360 --> 31:44.112
so if Yuri has her,
we've got to get there fast.

31:44.362 --> 31:45.154
I'm on my way.

31:45.363 --> 31:46.447
Detective...

31:47.740 --> 31:49.200
What did you say to her?

31:58.293 --> 32:00.461
LAPD. Get out
of the car, Yuri.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.547
Good Lord, you could at least

32:02.755 --> 32:04.424
fork out for a room, Yuri.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.259
No, no, no, no!

32:06.467 --> 32:07.468
Not the Italian leather!

32:07.677 --> 32:09.178
Bloody hell!

32:09.596 --> 32:11.055
Yeah, more like karma.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.267
We know you were
at the sex club last night,

32:14.475 --> 32:16.352
and you're responsible
for the death of two girls.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.104
What do you know
about Gisele?

32:18.521 --> 32:20.565
I don't know anyone
named Gisele.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.025
You have it all wrong.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.319
I only went to that club

32:24.527 --> 32:27.447
because Crystal
promised me newbies.

32:27.864 --> 32:29.866
I paid five grand apiece

32:30.074 --> 32:31.367
for those two
sweethearts.

32:31.576 --> 32:32.452
Who's Crystal?

32:33.036 --> 32:34.454
She was with Daria
and Naomi.

32:34.662 --> 32:36.748
Then you should most
definitely ask for a refund.

32:36.956 --> 32:40.168
I know. Those girls had no
idea that I was their date.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.544
You're telling me
Daria and Naomi

32:41.753 --> 32:43.129
had no idea
it was a sex club?

32:43.338 --> 32:44.422
No.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.050
When they found out,
they wanted to leave.

32:47.592 --> 32:49.218
Crystal bought them drinks,

32:49.427 --> 32:51.846
but they drank them
and bailed anyway.

32:52.055 --> 32:54.766
I was so upset that
I took the last sip and--

32:54.974 --> 32:56.392
You drank the rest
of the poison.

32:58.603 --> 33:00.897
I have been sick
ever since.

33:01.105 --> 33:02.106
Oh, God.

33:02.315 --> 33:04.025
Oh, no, no, no.
Not again.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.111
Is Gisele Crystal?

33:07.320 --> 33:08.529
Oh, you mean the chef's wife?

33:08.738 --> 33:10.156
Could she be the one
who killed Daria and Naomi?

33:10.365 --> 33:11.741
Well, Daria was sleeping
with her husband,

33:11.950 --> 33:13.701
so if anyone had a bone to pick,
it would be her.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.122
Yuri, do you know
Crystal's real name?

33:18.331 --> 33:20.875
No. But I have a picture.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.794
Oh, lovely.
I'll take that.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.630
Right. Ooh, pecker pic.

33:26.756 --> 33:27.924
- Pecker pic.
- Eww!

33:28.633 --> 33:29.592
Oh, hold on.

33:30.885 --> 33:32.345
That's not Gisele.

33:32.553 --> 33:34.639
No, and that blonde hair
doesn't look real either.

33:35.807 --> 33:36.641
You're right, it's a wig.

33:36.849 --> 33:39.185
And the girl wearing it
looks real familiar.

33:45.108 --> 33:47.694
Oh, it's just rush, rush, rush
in this town, isn't it?

33:47.902 --> 33:49.529
Oh, hi, detectives.

33:50.238 --> 33:52.115
I'm just putting
a few things in storage.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.533
I'm going back home.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.284
Right, you can take the girl
out of Nebraska,

33:55.493 --> 33:57.370
but you can't take Nebraska
out of the girl.

33:57.870 --> 33:58.746
Or can you?

33:59.372 --> 34:01.290
I don't feel safe
in L.A. anymore.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.376
You wouldn't either
if two of your neighbors

34:03.584 --> 34:04.460
wound up dead.

34:04.669 --> 34:06.004
Don't you just hate that?

34:06.796 --> 34:08.339
I'm sorry, I have
a flight at 3:00.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.257
Yes, and I've
just discovered

34:09.465 --> 34:10.925
this wonderful thing
called Facebook.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.844
- Have you heard of it?
- I have to go, please.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.637
'Cause Facebook's
heard of you.

34:14.846 --> 34:17.306
It knows that you're a big
deal in your small town.

34:17.681 --> 34:21.561
A ten back home,
but in L.A., just a five.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.938
Things haven't worked out
for you here, have they, Lily?

34:24.605 --> 34:27.817
So much heartache,
struggle, compromise.

34:28.484 --> 34:29.610
It made you
desperate enough

34:29.819 --> 34:31.279
to turn against your own
sorority sisters,

34:31.487 --> 34:32.612
Daria and Naomi.

34:32.822 --> 34:34.949
No. Daria and Naomi
were my friends.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.367
Were they?

34:36.909 --> 34:38.870
Because we know you were
with them the night they died.

34:39.203 --> 34:40.871
You said you hadn't
seen 'em for a week.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.040
You have no proof of that.

34:42.248 --> 34:45.543
Except for a photo taken
by your charming buddy Yuri.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.253
Nice wig, by the way.

34:47.712 --> 34:49.714
Really brings out
the murder in your eyes.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.387
Seems kitties do have claws.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.061
Please, just let me go.

35:03.394 --> 35:04.937
Is this the part where you wish
I had a gun, Detective?

35:05.146 --> 35:06.731
Shut up, Lucifer,
I got this.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.816
You pretended to be
a friend to those girls.

35:09.025 --> 35:10.276
Shame on you.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.070
They called <i>me!</i>

35:12.278 --> 35:13.946
They were desperate
for my help.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.991
The best workout class,
where to hike...

35:17.241 --> 35:18.117
this apartment!

35:18.326 --> 35:20.411
They asked you for help
and you preyed on them?

35:20.620 --> 35:21.996
I was doing them
a favor.

35:22.205 --> 35:23.956
What, by putting mandrake
in their drinks?

35:24.165 --> 35:26.334
I thought it was
an organic kind of roofie.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.086
I didn't know that
it would kill them.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.171
I was just trying
to loosen them up.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.631
You were trying to make
an extra buck

35:31.839 --> 35:33.132
by bringing in
a couple newbies.

35:33.633 --> 35:36.677
I won the Dame Judith
acting award in college.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.472
I was the <i>president</i> of our sorority.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.724
I should have
made it by now!

35:41.933 --> 35:44.227
L.A. was supposed
to be easy!

35:45.061 --> 35:46.813
Oh, phones...

35:47.021 --> 35:48.773
They can be
so distracting.

35:53.027 --> 35:57.365
There's a special place in Hell
for women who fake friendships

35:57.573 --> 36:01.119
as a way of manipulating
other women!

36:02.370 --> 36:03.663
She's right, you know.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.000
And I think we have
a silver lining, Detective.

36:08.167 --> 36:10.837
What with Lily going away,
and Daria and Naomi dead,

36:11.045 --> 36:12.839
I believe that there's
an apartment vacancy.

36:13.631 --> 36:15.466
Are you seriously suggesting
that I should move

36:15.675 --> 36:16.801
into a dead girl's apartment?

36:17.009 --> 36:19.303
No, no, no, the killer's place
is much nicer.

36:19.512 --> 36:22.140
I mean, just look
at this view!

36:48.207 --> 36:48.958
How'd you get
in here?

36:50.126 --> 36:53.462
Let's just say Samantha at the front
desk is no longer into men.

36:55.882 --> 36:57.133
What, you still mad?

36:58.217 --> 37:00.219
What was all that stuff
about being my tribe?

37:00.803 --> 37:01.888
You had fun,
didn't you?

37:04.056 --> 37:05.016
I don't have time for this.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.976
I have work to do.
You can go.

37:12.648 --> 37:14.025
I wasn't totally
faking it.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.488
Like when I strangled
psycho chick for the win.

37:19.697 --> 37:20.990
<i>That</i> was genuine.

37:21.365 --> 37:22.408
Gee, thanks.

37:23.534 --> 37:25.870
You know, I wouldn't just
kick ass for anyone.

37:26.746 --> 37:28.331
Okay, fine, I would.

37:28.539 --> 37:31.834
But this time
it was... sweeter.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.879
This is some twisted
version of an apology?

37:35.213 --> 37:36.589
I don't do apologies.

37:37.381 --> 37:38.633
But I don't want
to kill you anymore.

37:40.051 --> 37:42.595
You're a very,
very deranged person.

37:43.054 --> 37:44.055
Thanks.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.475
So, we're still good
to be roomies, right?

37:47.683 --> 37:48.643
What are you
talking about, <i>roomies?</i>

37:48.851 --> 37:49.810
We shook on it.

37:50.019 --> 37:51.687
Post-karaoke,
pre-potbelly dude.

37:52.647 --> 37:53.272
What?

37:53.481 --> 37:55.024
I told you I was
in between places.

37:55.233 --> 37:56.484
You said that you were
looking for someone

37:56.692 --> 37:57.818
to share expenses.

37:58.027 --> 37:58.945
Don't you remember?

38:02.156 --> 38:03.532
The missing half hour.

38:03.824 --> 38:06.410
Look... I've got money.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.163
I like your kid,
and you dress like crap,

38:09.580 --> 38:11.374
so I won't be stealing
any of your clothes.

38:11.749 --> 38:13.459
What, you got
a better plan?

38:16.921 --> 38:18.589
You said you wanted
fun, Decker.

38:20.424 --> 38:21.300
Fun.

38:22.677 --> 38:23.678
Oh, my...

38:27.473 --> 38:28.391
Roommates?

38:28.599 --> 38:29.684
You and Detective Decker?

38:29.892 --> 38:32.228
No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:32.436 --> 38:34.647
And have I mentioned "no,"
and also, "no"?

38:34.855 --> 38:37.024
- You're not my boss anymore.
- Well, that may be.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.985
But I can't have the women
in my life teaming up.

38:39.193 --> 38:40.361
I'll be outnumbered.

38:40.569 --> 38:43.531
Dad forbid you manage to
have sex with her before I do.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.908
Oh, actually, can I interest you
in another wager?

38:46.117 --> 38:48.119
No. Done deal.
Pay up.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.913
Fine,
the convertible's yours.

38:51.122 --> 38:52.164
I'm over that.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.833
Well, the hot,
new bartender.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.126
Been there, done that.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.544
Well, spit it out
then, Maze.

38:56.752 --> 38:57.712
What is it you want?

39:02.717 --> 39:03.884
I want a drink.

39:05.136 --> 39:06.595
What, that's it?

39:06.804 --> 39:08.431
Fine. Pick any bottle,
pull two glasses.

39:08.639 --> 39:12.226
No, I want you
to pour <i>me</i> a drink.

39:14.228 --> 39:15.104
All right.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.492
To newly defined
relationships.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.244
Cheers.

39:34.457 --> 39:36.667
Oh... please...

39:36.876 --> 39:38.461
don't drink
in front of me.

39:38.878 --> 39:40.796
Bad case of the
distractions, brother?

39:41.547 --> 39:43.466
Well, I better go.

39:43.674 --> 39:45.343
I'll let you deal
with the lightweight.

39:46.844 --> 39:48.679
Judging from your
behavior last night,

39:48.888 --> 39:51.015
that lunatic dancing,
I fear that my advice

39:51.223 --> 39:53.059
may have created a whole
new set of problems.

39:53.267 --> 39:55.853
No more turning
a "blind eye," Lucifer.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.646
Listen...

39:59.982 --> 40:02.735
We both know that Dad
is not the kind

40:02.943 --> 40:03.694
to forgive and forget.

40:03.903 --> 40:06.614
No distraction on earth
is gonna change that.

40:06.989 --> 40:08.407
I said that I would
punish Mom,

40:08.616 --> 40:10.534
and I'm doing so
here on earth.

40:10.743 --> 40:12.536
Deal maintained,
loophole achieved.

40:12.745 --> 40:13.871
What if He doesn't
feel that way?

40:15.247 --> 40:17.083
There will be real
consequences, Luci,

40:17.291 --> 40:18.376
for all of us.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.794
Especially me.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.129
You know, I liked
you better drunk.

40:22.338 --> 40:24.799
Tell me something, brother,
what deal <i>did</i> you make?

40:25.383 --> 40:27.468
What was worth writing
Father, of all people,

40:27.676 --> 40:28.552
a blank check?

40:28.761 --> 40:30.971
Not a what.
A who.

40:39.522 --> 40:41.607
You made a deal
for Chloe's <i>life?</i>

40:41.816 --> 40:43.150
Don't look at me like that!

40:43.359 --> 40:44.985
At the time, it made
a certain amount of sense.

40:45.194 --> 40:46.320
Don't you understand?

40:47.738 --> 40:49.448
You made a deal
to return Mom to Hell.

40:49.657 --> 40:52.284
In exchange,
Chloe's life was spared.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.994
Well, that's one
interpretation.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.288
Despite whatever loopholes
you think you found,

40:56.497 --> 40:58.749
and the lies that
you have told yourself,

40:58.958 --> 41:01.419
you still haven't delivered
on your end of the bargain.

41:02.086 --> 41:04.672
Luci, what if Dad
decides to

41:05.297 --> 41:06.882
take back His side
of the deal?

41:10.219 --> 41:12.596
One silly human soul?

41:13.681 --> 41:16.475
I can't imagine Dad would
take much interest in that.

41:17.601 --> 41:19.645
<i>Yes, two adult women and a child.</i>

41:19.854 --> 41:20.980
Just bring over a deposit,

41:21.188 --> 41:22.022
and the apartment's yours.

41:22.231 --> 41:25.317
Really? Oh, yeah,
I will, uh...

41:25.526 --> 41:27.319
Great, I'll drop off
a check right away.

41:27.528 --> 41:29.238
- Okay, thank you.
- Of course.
