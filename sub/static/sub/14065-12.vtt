<i>Previously on Boston Legal:</i>

00:02.111 --> 00:04.738
This is Vanessa Walker.
She's from our New York office.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.698
She invited me to join
Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

00:07.865 --> 00:10.908
- I'm a fan of diversity. I date midgets.
- And their mothers.

00:11.075 --> 00:13.368
- I got kicked out of my gym.
- An all-girls gym.

00:13.535 --> 00:17.455
That's why you went back to that club
as Clarence, so Sandy could meet you.

00:17.621 --> 00:19.247
I'd love to have dinner with you.

00:19.414 --> 00:24.001
I'm hearing that Jeffrey Coho
has set his little antennae on Denise.

00:24.168 --> 00:26.753
- I'd like to start seeing you.
- Friends with benefits?

00:26.919 --> 00:29.463
Do you know what
"friends with benefits" means?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.464
You slut.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:48.100 --> 00:54.480
Denise, I couldn't help but notice
your busy hands from afar.

00:54.688 --> 01:00.692
I find there's little more intoxicating
than a pretty woman with a busy hand.

01:00.859 --> 01:06.237
I imagine later tonight,
when I let my mind wander to you...

01:06.404 --> 01:11.574
...as it so invariably does,
my hand, too, will become busy.

01:11.741 --> 01:15.035
Alan, you've met Vanessa, right?

01:20.371 --> 01:24.625
Out of curiosity, how many times
have women in the workplace sued you?

01:24.833 --> 01:28.293
It never gets old.
Will you be suing me?

01:29.377 --> 01:31.545
- I can't fly.
- You're just discovering this?

01:31.712 --> 01:35.006
Bella and I were headed for Hawaii.
I got detained at the airport.

01:35.215 --> 01:37.132
- They wouldn't let me board.
- Why?

01:37.341 --> 01:39.426
According to their records,
I'm a terrorist.

01:39.593 --> 01:41.677
- What?
- That's what they said. A terrorist.

01:41.844 --> 01:44.804
- Bella's in Hawaii and I'm not. Help me.
- Okay.

01:44.971 --> 01:48.015
Nobody gets away
with calling Denny Crane a terrorist.

01:48.224 --> 01:51.226
- What would you like me to do?
- Perfect world, we blow them up.

01:51.392 --> 01:53.477
- Short of that.
- Sleep with their wives.

01:53.644 --> 01:54.895
- Do better.
- Daughters?

01:55.061 --> 01:56.395
Denny, you're an American.

01:56.562 --> 01:59.356
What does any true,
red, white and blue American do...

01:59.522 --> 02:03.317
...when he's been wronged,
or even slightly put out, for that matter?

02:05.568 --> 02:06.903
We sue.

02:41.175 --> 02:43.468
Vanessa, thanks for coming.

02:45.136 --> 02:47.346
This is Helen Choi.

02:47.763 --> 02:49.597
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

02:49.764 --> 02:52.349
Let's just jump right in,
since time is running short.

02:53.308 --> 02:55.184
Helen teaches first grade in Allston.

02:55.393 --> 02:58.520
She tragically had
one of her students pass away...

02:58.687 --> 03:00.855
...due to an allergic reaction
to peanuts.

03:01.063 --> 03:02.731
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:02.940 --> 03:06.984
The parents are suing her, citing
her negligence in the death of the child.

03:07.150 --> 03:08.485
The trial starts Wednesday.

03:08.652 --> 03:12.071
I had another lawyer, but the parents'
attorneys are from a big firm...

03:12.238 --> 03:14.280
...and they seemed
to have overwhelmed him.

03:14.489 --> 03:16.573
Why are they claiming
you were negligent?

03:17.408 --> 03:20.868
First, for allowing the peanuts
to even get in the room.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.662
We check the lunches...

03:23.829 --> 03:27.707
...but another student had brought in
a candy bar that I didn't know about.

03:27.873 --> 03:31.792
And also, at the time of the incident,
I was on my cell phone.

03:32.543 --> 03:36.796
It probably did distract me for a few
seconds before I got to the EpiPen.

03:37.003 --> 03:41.048
I've scheduled a settlement conference
for today. I'd like you to join us.

03:41.215 --> 03:43.842
How long after that did the child die?

03:46.844 --> 03:51.264
He died right there in the classroom.

03:54.850 --> 03:57.685
Okay, Denny. It's true.
You're on a No Fly List.

03:57.852 --> 04:00.478
- See, I told you.
- They've confused you with somebody.

04:00.645 --> 04:03.272
I arranged a meeting with a man
from Homeland Security.

04:03.439 --> 04:05.606
- Excellent.
- He's coming here, actually.

04:05.815 --> 04:08.692
His office is in some disarray.

04:10.401 --> 04:12.319
And we won't be needing any guns.

04:12.486 --> 04:16.447
Just wanna show him I've got them,
like a good American. Why's he coming?

04:16.613 --> 04:20.700
Well, he didn't want you going there,
in case you also turned out to be...

04:23.076 --> 04:25.786
- What?
- Well, a spy.

04:25.953 --> 04:28.746
- A spy?
- Denny, we'll clear it up. I promise.

04:28.913 --> 04:31.707
- A spy?
- Isn't there anyone you know?

04:31.874 --> 04:35.626
Well, I can't get anybody. I called
Tom DeLay. His number's disconnected.

04:35.793 --> 04:38.712
Foley's hands are full.
Frist said, "Don't take it personal."

04:38.879 --> 04:41.714
Clarence Thomas'
office said he was indisposed.

04:41.881 --> 04:44.215
- Have you tried going right to the top?
- Cheney?

04:44.382 --> 04:46.425
- Boys?
- Shirley.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.260
Did you hear? Denny can't fly.

04:48.677 --> 04:52.012
- Tell me about it. Have you seen Claire?
- No. Why?

04:52.512 --> 04:55.014
Her assistant's causing
a bit of a stir in reception.

04:55.222 --> 04:57.099
- Clarence?
- Lf only it were Clarence.

04:57.308 --> 04:58.850
- Clarice?
- I still wish.

04:59.058 --> 05:01.935
- Who?
- Oprah.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.939
Oh, my...

05:09.399 --> 05:13.860
- He's hot.
- Why is everybody hugging her?

05:14.319 --> 05:17.905
She just gave them all cars.
Evidently, high-end.

05:20.031 --> 05:22.824
- Denny Crane.
- Hello, Denny.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.962
- Clarence, did something happen?
- Nothing happened, child.

05:43.129 --> 05:45.506
It's just, January
is Martin Luther King Month.

05:45.715 --> 05:47.507
I used to dress up as Dr. King.

05:47.716 --> 05:50.968
But kids today,
half of them don't know who he is.

05:51.135 --> 05:52.969
But they all know Oprah.

05:54.179 --> 05:58.056
Excuse me, Homeland Security
is in your office.

05:59.891 --> 06:01.224
Okay.

06:01.391 --> 06:04.268
And why would Homeland Security
be in your office?

06:04.435 --> 06:06.354
Do you really wanna know, Paul?

06:07.562 --> 06:08.939
No.

06:09.105 --> 06:12.441
Dennis Crane, the one we targeted,
is a Canadian-born citizen...

06:12.608 --> 06:17.110
...who converted to Islam and took up
jihad against the U.S. After 9/11.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.071
He visited several terrorist
training camps in Pakistan...

06:20.237 --> 06:21.781
...with known ties to al Qaeda.

06:22.489 --> 06:24.658
He changed his name
to Mohammad Alzwari.

06:24.865 --> 06:27.242
But his passport still lists him
as Dennis Crane.

06:27.409 --> 06:29.577
Which is why the name
is on the No Fly List.

06:30.286 --> 06:31.703
So...

06:33.288 --> 06:37.040
- Now that we've cleared it up...
- It's not that simple.

06:37.540 --> 06:40.376
The current technology
doesn't provide airline officials...

06:40.542 --> 06:43.836
...with the target's date of birth,
race or physical description.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.421
- Just a name.
- Wait, are you saying...

06:46.588 --> 06:48.839
...anyone named Dennis Crane...?

06:49.048 --> 06:51.800
Will not be allowed to fly
on commercial airliners.

06:51.966 --> 06:55.678
Unless he can get on the list
of people on the No Fly List who can fly.

06:55.886 --> 06:59.430
- Okay. So put him on that list.
- Also not simple.

06:59.597 --> 07:02.724
He'll have to fill out a form
and wait for approval.

07:02.933 --> 07:06.976
- Well, how long will that take?
- It's indeterminate.

07:08.186 --> 07:09.521
You're joking.

07:09.688 --> 07:11.522
The government
has no sense of humor.

07:11.689 --> 07:14.315
Neither should you,
when it comes to the war on terror.

07:14.482 --> 07:16.316
- Let me shoot him.
- Mr. Murch...

07:16.525 --> 07:19.819
...there is nobody more
red, white and blue than this man here.

07:20.027 --> 07:23.613
He's for the death penalty, he's pro-life,
he doesn't read newspapers.

07:23.822 --> 07:27.116
He's exercised every loophole
to avoid paying taxes.

07:27.282 --> 07:29.659
He's even donated
to the Jack Abramoff ball.

07:29.867 --> 07:34.286
I sympathize with you, I really do.
But these are the prices we pay...

07:34.495 --> 07:37.497
...to live in a free and democratic society
which is safe.

07:37.705 --> 07:39.873
- Let me shoot him.
- Are you threatening me?

07:40.082 --> 07:43.126
No. That job falls to me, Mr. Murch.

07:43.334 --> 07:47.504
I will ask you nicely
to put Denny's name on the fly list...

07:47.712 --> 07:50.631
...or I will complicate your life
in federal court.

07:50.798 --> 07:53.716
By the time I'm finished,
your superiors won't be saying:

07:53.883 --> 07:56.051
"Heck of a job, Murchie."

07:58.594 --> 08:00.471
You're threatening
to mess up my life?

08:01.263 --> 08:03.223
You're talking to Homeland Security.

08:04.515 --> 08:06.517
We're the master.

08:10.519 --> 08:13.146
We couldn't have been
more clear with her.

08:13.312 --> 08:16.314
We had a meeting
to specifically discuss the allergy.

08:16.481 --> 08:18.150
We went over the precise procedure.

08:18.316 --> 08:22.235
- She knew the severity of the risk.
- We understand, Mrs. Beckett.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.903
Nobody's denying the tragedy
that occurred.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.364
But you're denying her culpability,
are you not?

08:27.573 --> 08:32.241
Mr. And Mrs. Beckett, I'm sure you can
appreciate that as Helen's lawyers...

08:32.450 --> 08:35.995
...we can't admit any liability
on her part, but let's assume...

08:36.162 --> 08:39.664
...for the sake of argument,
she bears some responsibility.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.206
She has no assets.

08:41.373 --> 08:44.041
Any judgment you get
would not be recoverable.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.042
This is not about money,
Ms. Schmidt.

08:46.459 --> 08:51.380
Okay. Then if I may ask,
what is it about?

08:53.923 --> 08:55.257
We wanna send a message.

08:55.757 --> 09:01.344
We wanna put the word out
that teachers like her need to take care.

09:02.762 --> 09:04.471
You need to take care.

09:13.477 --> 09:17.314
- Take off the wig, Clarence.
- This wig doesn't come off as easily.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.940
It doesn't just pop off
like a hood ornament.

09:20.149 --> 09:22.400
What happened?
Something went wrong with Sandy.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.277
Sandy's a darling girl.

09:24.444 --> 09:27.487
But she wasn't remotely in a place
to have a relationship.

09:27.695 --> 09:29.030
What happened?

09:30.239 --> 09:32.282
There weren't any
precipitating factors.

09:32.490 --> 09:36.201
Sometimes two people,
despite having a lot in common...

09:36.410 --> 09:39.495
- Can you just take off the wig?
- Enough with the wig!

09:39.912 --> 09:43.456
- Forget the wig.
- Who was that?

09:44.874 --> 09:47.250
From the sound of his voice,
I'd say Clavant.

09:48.627 --> 09:51.295
Clarence, you're not schizophrenic.

09:51.503 --> 09:55.422
You're just choosing to hide behind
these personas, especially when...

09:58.507 --> 10:03.595
- What exactly happened with Sandy?
- You know, honey, I'll make a deal.

10:03.802 --> 10:06.180
We'll talk about Clarence
and his personal life...

10:06.347 --> 10:11.224
...if we can first discuss yours.
Do you have a personal life, Claire?

10:11.433 --> 10:14.477
- In the workplace, absolutely not.
- Anyplace?

10:15.019 --> 10:17.479
Why do you dress the way you do?

10:17.687 --> 10:21.731
- What's the wrong with the way I dress?
- It just isn't very sexual.

10:21.939 --> 10:24.733
You appear to have a very good body,
and you cover it up.

10:24.941 --> 10:27.069
I do not.

10:33.448 --> 10:36.200
Have you been sexually assaulted,
Claire?

10:37.533 --> 10:41.662
Okay, Oprah. Isn't this when,
on your show, you cut to a commercial?

10:41.828 --> 10:43.996
You ask a big, loaded,
melodramatic question.

10:44.205 --> 10:47.082
And then you say,
"We'll be right back after this."

10:47.248 --> 10:49.249
Why don't you say that?

11:06.595 --> 11:08.846
One second, Denny.

11:09.013 --> 11:13.599
Denny and I are off to federal court.
Seems he's on the No Fly List.

11:14.308 --> 11:16.059
Gee.

11:16.226 --> 11:20.938
I thought you'd be more sympathetic.
Denny can't spread his wings.

11:21.146 --> 11:22.814
Imagine how you'd feel...

11:23.022 --> 11:27.900
...if you were robbed of the opportunity
to spread yours.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.735
That is so lame.

11:30.902 --> 11:34.154
- Why do you smell of sex, Denise?
- Excuse me?

11:34.321 --> 11:37.365
A woman gives off a certain scent
when she's having sex.

11:38.408 --> 11:42.536
- Who are you having sex with, Denise?
- Okay, you are out of your mind.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.246
It smells like Brad. Is it Brad?

11:49.123 --> 11:50.791
- What was that all about?
- He knows.

11:50.958 --> 11:53.334
- Knows what?
- That we're having sex.

11:53.501 --> 11:54.544
Did you tell anybody?

11:54.709 --> 11:57.462
How could he possibly know
unless you told somebody?

11:57.670 --> 12:01.631
I didn't tell anybody.
He smelled it on me.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.468
Oh, stop it.

12:13.139 --> 12:15.723
I had checked the lunches.
I check them all every day.

12:15.932 --> 12:18.518
The school has a strict
no-peanut policy.

12:18.725 --> 12:21.686
Yes. And all parents
were notified verbally and in writing...

12:21.853 --> 12:24.522
...not to bring anything
with nuts to class.

12:24.688 --> 12:27.565
- So, what happened?
- Well, the children were eating.

12:27.731 --> 12:30.567
All of a sudden, Nate...

12:30.733 --> 12:33.069
He was on the floor.

12:33.694 --> 12:36.821
I went over. He had gone into shock.

12:37.155 --> 12:39.365
- And then?
- And then I followed the protocol.

12:39.532 --> 12:42.616
I unlocked the first-aid cabinet.
I got out an EpiPen.

12:42.783 --> 12:44.493
I jammed it into his thigh, but...

12:46.369 --> 12:47.787
It was too late.

12:48.579 --> 12:50.831
It turns out, another student
had brought in...

12:50.998 --> 12:53.624
...a mini candy bar
with nuts in it, and...

12:53.958 --> 12:57.252
- I never saw it.
- What exactly were you doing...

12:57.419 --> 12:59.837
...when Nate Beckett
went into anaphylactic shock?

13:00.962 --> 13:02.630
I was talking on my cell phone.

13:02.797 --> 13:06.341
Is that permissible, for teachers
to be on their cell phones during class?

13:06.508 --> 13:09.926
It was during lunch.
But, no, it is not permissible.

13:10.886 --> 13:14.555
My father had had surgery that morning.
I was anxious to check up on him.

13:14.763 --> 13:18.182
You had your back turned on your
students as you spoke on the phone.

13:18.349 --> 13:20.350
My father had
a life-threatening condition.

13:20.517 --> 13:22.143
I didn't wanna alarm the students.

13:22.310 --> 13:25.145
How long had Nate been on the floor
before you noticed him?

13:25.312 --> 13:27.813
Well, the children started
to scream, so...

13:29.023 --> 13:31.399
- I don't know. Not long.
- Twenty seconds?

13:31.566 --> 13:34.901
- At the most. I would say under.
- But possibly 20 seconds?

13:36.986 --> 13:38.863
Possibly.

13:39.030 --> 13:41.948
- How long have you been a teacher?
- Seven years.

13:42.157 --> 13:45.367
- Do you like it?
- I love it. It's all I ever wanted to do.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.869
Has anything like this ever happened
in your class before?

13:49.036 --> 13:51.746
No. God, no.

13:52.663 --> 13:54.457
I just...

13:56.082 --> 13:58.375
I know I shouldn't have been
on my cell phone.

13:59.209 --> 14:03.629
If I may ask, what was the outcome
of your dad's surgery?

14:04.755 --> 14:06.797
He didn't make it.

14:08.049 --> 14:09.883
We're back
from that commercial break...

14:10.050 --> 14:12.926
...in case you wanna continue
our conversation.

14:13.093 --> 14:15.720
Know what? You wanna
take off that wig and talk? Fine.

14:15.887 --> 14:17.722
But I'm not sharing my life
with Oprah.

14:17.889 --> 14:21.433
I'm not capable of having that talk
as Clarence, which you know.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.976
You got issues, girl.
You can go through life...

14:24.143 --> 14:26.686
...letting people in
or keeping them shut out.

14:26.853 --> 14:28.687
Your choice.

14:28.854 --> 14:31.647
I have never been sexually assaulted.

14:31.856 --> 14:34.941
I have certainly been groped
on the odd date.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.027
But let's just say,
it's nothing I couldn't handle.

14:38.235 --> 14:41.863
Is one of the ways you handle it
by dressing in a non-sexual way?

14:42.072 --> 14:44.865
I don't think I dress that way.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.909
I dress maybe
a little conservatively but...

14:48.076 --> 14:51.494
Why? Conservative is not a word
I'd use to describe you, Claire.

14:51.660 --> 14:53.913
You're a balls-out kind of girl.

14:54.080 --> 14:59.083
In case you haven't noticed, this place
is a rather spectacular boys' club.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.709
If you so much as turn your back
on Denny Crane...

15:01.918 --> 15:03.668
...he tries to mount you.

15:03.877 --> 15:06.254
<i>Alan Shore
is in the Guinness Book of Lechers.</i>

15:06.463 --> 15:07.922
I don't believe you.

15:08.756 --> 15:13.842
- I am standing here talking to Oprah.
- Shirley Schmidt is a name partner.

15:14.051 --> 15:17.637
And a queen bee,
which is how she'd like to keep it.

15:17.804 --> 15:20.722
Look, I'm busy.
Let's cut to another commercial.

15:20.889 --> 15:25.141
One reason this may be an old boys' club
is because the women here...

15:25.308 --> 15:27.935
...feel they have to become
one of the boys to succeed.

15:28.477 --> 15:30.395
You're a tough broad, Claire.

15:30.561 --> 15:34.106
If any girl's got a shot at crashing
through that Plexiglas ceiling...

15:34.272 --> 15:37.608
...it's got to be you.
Don't be afraid to be sexy.

15:38.234 --> 15:43.779
And don't be afraid to be soft.
Succeed on your terms here, not theirs.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.782
How about we both try
and work on that?

15:49.366 --> 15:54.536
Clarence needs to come back to work.
I can't afford Oprah.

15:55.161 --> 15:57.871
They pulled me out before I boarded,
put me in this room.

15:58.038 --> 16:01.040
At some point, somebody joined you
in the little room.

16:01.207 --> 16:03.417
Somebody
from Transportation Security.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.919
- Told me I can't fly.
- Did he say why?

16:07.086 --> 16:10.296
- My name's on the No Fly List.
- You've since cleared the confusion?

16:10.505 --> 16:13.131
The confusion, but not the problem.
Still can't fly.

16:13.298 --> 16:18.261
Unless I get these special papers,
which will take who knows how long?

16:18.426 --> 16:21.304
It's ridiculous.
That's why I usually fly private.

16:21.512 --> 16:23.681
- You're still not allowed to fly?
- No.

16:24.223 --> 16:25.974
Why has this reached my courtroom?

16:26.182 --> 16:28.392
Mr. Crane is looking
for special treatment.

16:28.600 --> 16:32.937
Special treatment? To fly on an airplane
without government interference?

16:33.104 --> 16:36.106
The special treatment he seeks
is to get off the No Fly List...

16:36.273 --> 16:39.566
...without the specified papers
taxpayers on the list must wait for.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.110
Why are typical taxpayers
even on the list?

16:42.318 --> 16:44.069
Look. In case you haven't noticed...

16:44.236 --> 16:46.070
- Here it comes.
- We're in a war on terror.

16:46.279 --> 16:49.239
People screamed after 9/11
we didn't do enough to prevent it.

16:49.447 --> 16:51.199
- Now we're doing too much?
- You are.

16:51.407 --> 16:54.659
Law-abiding, loyal Americans
are being treated like shoe bombers.

16:54.826 --> 16:56.911
Shoe bombers
don't declare themselves...

16:57.078 --> 17:00.372
Mr. Randolph, I am not persuaded.
Who have you got?

17:00.580 --> 17:01.872
I have Linwood Winchell...

17:02.039 --> 17:04.499
...from the Transportation
Security Administration.

17:04.665 --> 17:06.209
Get his ass up here.

17:08.419 --> 17:09.752
I like you.

17:15.964 --> 17:19.300
Anaphylactic shock can come on
suddenly, which is what happened here.

17:19.509 --> 17:22.386
The airways can become clogged
in less than 30 seconds.

17:22.553 --> 17:25.430
If the EpiPen isn't administered,
it can be fatal.

17:25.597 --> 17:27.763
If Ms. Choi had gotten
to your son sooner...

17:27.931 --> 17:31.726
We obviously can't know for sure,
but he had had these attacks before.

17:32.226 --> 17:35.604
And the EpiPen, along with the pills,
had proven effective.

17:35.812 --> 17:39.273
So her delay might very well
have contributed to his death.

17:40.857 --> 17:43.608
- Yes.
- Now, Mr. Beckett.

17:43.817 --> 17:45.985
She's a teacher, not a doctor.

17:46.193 --> 17:49.571
No, teachers are trained in first aid,
including the use of an EpiPen.

17:49.738 --> 17:53.407
This teacher, in fact, had been trained.
We made sure of it.

17:53.615 --> 17:57.451
But realistically, is what happened here
really a foreseeable thing?

17:57.617 --> 18:00.745
Yes. Healthcare-need students
are now typically mainstream.

18:00.953 --> 18:03.580
Between 10 and 20 percent
of public-school students...

18:03.747 --> 18:07.082
...have chronic physical,
emotional or social problems.

18:07.291 --> 18:10.043
And the peanut allergy is a big one.

18:10.877 --> 18:12.669
Which she knew.

18:13.086 --> 18:15.921
Ten to 20 percent
of our high-school students...

18:16.130 --> 18:18.341
...have chronic medical
or social problems?

18:18.506 --> 18:21.842
Fifty million Americans suffer
from some kind of autoimmune disease.

18:22.051 --> 18:23.552
It's become epidemic.

18:23.719 --> 18:25.970
Are we increasing the nurses
in public schools?

18:26.179 --> 18:29.598
- As far as I know, no.
- So we just hand off to the teachers?

18:29.765 --> 18:32.141
Reading, writing, arithmetic
and epidemics?

18:32.308 --> 18:35.810
She knew her responsibilities,
accepted them...

18:36.019 --> 18:37.811
...and failed to live up to them.

18:43.607 --> 18:45.483
Look, we're all sorry for the mix-up.

18:45.649 --> 18:49.402
But we are in a pitched battle
with religious fanatics...

18:49.569 --> 18:53.280
...who use civilian aircraft as missiles
against high-density targets.

18:53.489 --> 18:56.282
Well, can't you just take
Mr. Crane's name off the list?

18:56.449 --> 18:58.241
In which case, the one we targeted...

18:58.408 --> 19:01.202
...that terrorist with the jihad,
is allowed to travel.

19:01.368 --> 19:03.995
- None of us want that.
- The system can't differentiate?

19:04.204 --> 19:06.247
In time, it will be able to.

19:06.455 --> 19:10.750
But for now, let's make the skies safe.
And we're doing that, by the way.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.919
There hasn't been an aviation hijacking
since 9/11.

19:14.461 --> 19:18.214
Mr. Crane left that detail
out of his lawsuit.

19:18.379 --> 19:20.632
You seem quite pleased with yourself.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.801
Actually, Mr. Shore,
my tone is more exasperated.

19:24.009 --> 19:27.427
I'm rather sick of everyone
dumping on Homeland Security.

19:27.636 --> 19:30.471
- By everyone, you mean...?
- The media.

19:30.679 --> 19:32.556
The lawyers who love to file suit.

19:32.765 --> 19:36.433
The 9/11 Commission, they dumped
on you pretty good, didn't they?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.435
- Somewhat.
- Somewhat?

19:38.894 --> 19:43.104
A D in port security, an F in improving
communications for first responders.

19:43.271 --> 19:46.148
A D in border security.
An F in aviation security.

19:46.357 --> 19:50.068
A D in chemical-plant security.
These aren't passing grades.

19:50.276 --> 19:53.862
We're doing what we can,
and lawsuits like this one don't help.

19:54.071 --> 19:56.280
I read Ted Kennedy
was on your No Fly List.

19:56.447 --> 20:00.075
- Does he take the train now?
- That situation was resolved.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.368
And yet the British suspects
who were arrested last summer...

20:03.535 --> 20:06.537
...for plotting to blow up aircraft,
they weren't on the list.

20:06.703 --> 20:11.290
Despite being under surveillance
for over a year. How is that possible?

20:11.499 --> 20:15.126
- The more dangerous ones, we leave off.
- Excuse me?

20:15.334 --> 20:18.586
If suspected terrorists knew
their names were on the list...

20:18.753 --> 20:22.172
...they could change operational plans
and make them harder to capture.

20:22.381 --> 20:25.299
So Mr. Crane, an American citizen...

20:25.508 --> 20:28.760
...who has no ties to any
terrorist organization, is on the list.

20:28.927 --> 20:32.221
But some of the most
dangerous terrorists are not?

20:32.388 --> 20:33.805
I'll tell you this, Mr. Smug.

20:33.972 --> 20:37.432
For every innocent caught in the net,
there is 10 guilty ones.

20:37.599 --> 20:39.809
- So don't tell me...
- Really? Like whom?

20:39.976 --> 20:44.229
- I can't reveal classified information.
- Lucky for me, I have my own sources.

20:44.437 --> 20:48.190
A recent study
of the 441 terrorism-related arrests...

20:48.356 --> 20:52.442
...made in the United States
revealed that virtually all of them...

20:52.609 --> 20:58.655
...involved lesser charges,
like visa violations, fraud, not terrorism.

20:58.822 --> 21:03.658
You know, sir, I go to work every day
and try to make America safer.

21:03.825 --> 21:06.618
What do you do?
I'll tell you what you do.

21:06.827 --> 21:09.287
You represent a lot of people
like Mr. Crane...

21:09.453 --> 21:11.956
...who have a lot of time and money
on their hands...

21:12.123 --> 21:14.749
...who can afford to manipulate
the legal system...

21:14.916 --> 21:16.667
...to make my job tougher.

21:18.459 --> 21:19.961
I suppose you're right.

21:20.169 --> 21:24.547
One has to wonder
how many Denny Cranes are out there...

21:24.714 --> 21:29.134
...being denied the right to fly,
who can't afford an attorney.

21:30.093 --> 21:33.053
Do we have any with us today?
If so, please stand.

21:39.724 --> 21:43.018
Everyone here is named Denny Crane.

21:43.184 --> 21:46.186
These are just the ones
within driving distance, of course...

21:46.353 --> 21:48.438
...since airplane travel
was not an option.

21:53.942 --> 21:55.609
Thank you.

22:10.828 --> 22:13.329
- Would you please?
- You still smell of sex.

22:13.496 --> 22:17.082
This time with a tinge
of Jeffrey Coho.

22:18.042 --> 22:19.959
- Are you on drugs?
- Hi, guys.

22:20.835 --> 22:26.380
- Are you sleeping with Denise, Jeffrey?
- He is not.

22:29.090 --> 22:30.424
- So, what did he want?
- Who?

22:30.591 --> 22:33.760
- Shore. I saw him in there.
- Usual nonsense.

22:33.926 --> 22:37.846
If it's any help, Sally said
that he can't take any role reversal.

22:38.055 --> 22:41.015
- What does that mean?
- When the woman becomes a predator...

22:41.182 --> 22:42.932
...he runs away like a little bunny.

22:44.350 --> 22:46.101
Really?

22:51.605 --> 22:56.192
Now, Mrs. Beckett,
this lawsuit can't bring your son back.

22:56.358 --> 22:59.194
No, but maybe
it can save someone else's child.

22:59.611 --> 23:03.446
Like my husband said, there are millions
of children with autoimmune diseases...

23:03.654 --> 23:06.490
...many in public schools,
relying on a standard of care.

23:06.865 --> 23:09.658
If this lawsuit can sound a bell...

23:09.825 --> 23:14.579
We count on our teachers.
My God, we trust you with our babies.

23:16.163 --> 23:18.081
I don't mean to be insensitive.

23:18.289 --> 23:21.416
But you're a person of means,
are you not, Mrs. Beckett?

23:22.375 --> 23:24.335
I'm financially secure.

23:24.543 --> 23:28.171
- Lf you think that eases my pain...
- I'm sure that it doesn't, but...

23:28.379 --> 23:31.548
And I'm sorry
if this does sound insensitive.

23:32.174 --> 23:36.676
But you had the means
to hire a shadow nurse, didn't you?

23:36.843 --> 23:38.303
Some parents do that.

23:38.470 --> 23:42.972
They sit in the back of the classroom
pretending to be a lab teacher, or...

23:44.098 --> 23:48.768
Or you could've put your son
in private school...

23:49.143 --> 23:52.145
...where the teacher-student ratio
is less than 30-to-1.

23:52.312 --> 23:55.022
- How dare you?
- I apologize, Mrs. Beckett.

23:55.231 --> 23:58.441
But you're sitting in that chair
playing armchair quarterback...

23:58.608 --> 24:02.778
...saying that my client
could've prevented this tragedy.

24:03.945 --> 24:05.905
When, in fact, you could've as well.

24:07.364 --> 24:10.866
I would have done whatever
I thought necessary, Miss Walker...

24:11.075 --> 24:14.202
...including private schools
or shadow nurses.

24:14.369 --> 24:18.246
After meeting with your client,
I didn't believe that to be necessary.

24:18.454 --> 24:22.874
Because my client struck you
as being both capable and dedicated.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.585
Yes.

24:28.544 --> 24:30.462
Thank you.

24:34.257 --> 24:37.384
We live in a different world
since 9/11.

24:37.592 --> 24:41.553
But no one here seems really willing
to live in that world.

24:41.845 --> 24:45.180
Sergeant Mike Krause of the Army's
101 st Airborne Division...

24:45.347 --> 24:47.140
...in both Iraq and Afghanistan...

24:47.307 --> 24:50.101
<i>...was recently quoted
in the New York Times. He said:</i>

24:50.268 --> 24:54.770
"We're nowhere close to sharing
the sacrifice. And it must be shared.

24:54.979 --> 24:58.231
Because it's only in that sharing
that society will truly care...

24:58.398 --> 25:00.691
...about what's going on over there."

25:00.857 --> 25:02.609
In previous wartimes, the public...

25:02.818 --> 25:05.152
...was called upon
to make great sacrifices.

25:05.361 --> 25:07.862
They were told to give up meat
and rubber and steel.

25:08.029 --> 25:10.364
Young men were drafted
into the military.

25:10.572 --> 25:13.199
Today, there's no draft,
there's no rationing.

25:13.366 --> 25:16.785
No one's telling you to buy war bonds.
No one's rounding you up...

25:16.952 --> 25:20.079
...to put you in internment camps
because of your nationality.

25:20.287 --> 25:23.498
The No Fly List is an inconvenience,
Your Honor...

25:23.665 --> 25:26.750
...and an inconvenience
for a very small part of the population.

25:27.125 --> 25:31.128
Just think, if we had been able
to stop those 9/11 hijackers...

25:31.294 --> 25:35.381
...from ever getting on those planes,
because their names were on a list...

25:35.548 --> 25:39.508
...warning us
of their potential for harm.

25:40.634 --> 25:46.346
But all Mr. Crane seems to care about is
he's delayed getting to Maui.

25:47.597 --> 25:49.890
Some sacrifice.

25:53.351 --> 25:55.185
This is going to be long, isn't it?

26:02.858 --> 26:05.234
Some of the new iPods...

26:05.443 --> 26:10.195
...you can load up to 20,000 songs
on them.

26:10.612 --> 26:14.907
Streams of videos, pictures,
all on a thing this big.

26:15.115 --> 26:20.119
The technology in this country
is staggering.

26:20.327 --> 26:24.246
And yet the government
can't get their computers...

26:24.413 --> 26:27.248
...to erase my client
from the No Fly List...

26:27.415 --> 26:29.876
...even though they admit
he shouldn't be on it.

26:30.208 --> 26:34.420
Instead, anybody named Denny Crane
can't fly.

26:34.587 --> 26:37.088
Now, Mr. Winchell is correct.

26:37.255 --> 26:39.840
He doesn't need me
to indict Homeland Security.

26:40.007 --> 26:42.049
The 9/11 Commission already did that.

26:42.216 --> 26:44.927
The American public
doesn't need to hear it from me.

26:45.093 --> 26:50.389
No. What Homeland Security
could really use from me or others...

26:50.556 --> 26:53.183
Preferably others... . Is a little help.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.559
Why not get it?

26:55.768 --> 26:59.770
I'm sure Tom Ridge
is a very nice man, capable too.

26:59.937 --> 27:05.733
As is Michael Chertoff.
But I can get 20,000 songs on my iPod.

27:05.941 --> 27:10.527
We have geniuses in this country,
true pioneers of innovation.

27:10.736 --> 27:14.697
Steve Jobs, Steven Wozniak,
Steve Ballmer.

27:14.864 --> 27:17.115
If we just could round up
our best Steves...

27:17.282 --> 27:21.910
We've got kids in garages
inventing Google and YouTube.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.328
Jets can not only fly by computer...

27:24.495 --> 27:27.538
...but they can now take off
and land on autopilot.

27:27.747 --> 27:32.626
Should we truly be stumped
by this No Fly computer list?

27:32.834 --> 27:35.836
How about something so simple
as issuing a flyer's license?

27:36.044 --> 27:38.671
It could have your picture,
fingerprints.

27:38.838 --> 27:41.131
Scan the card
and your fingers at the gate.

27:41.298 --> 27:45.634
If it's a match, you get your aisle seat.
This can't be undoable.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.135
Expensive, maybe.

27:47.302 --> 27:49.595
But judging from
recent spending patterns...

27:49.762 --> 27:51.596
...we've got billions to throw around.

27:51.804 --> 27:55.098
Halliburton alone has profited
over 10 billion from the war.

27:55.265 --> 27:57.516
Maybe we could get them to kick in.

27:57.683 --> 28:02.604
Why is it our government leaders
only tap into the private sector...

28:02.771 --> 28:06.564
...for campaign contributions
or to pass out contracts to cronies?

28:06.773 --> 28:10.567
Bill Gates is out there. Paul Allen.
Has anybody called them?

28:10.776 --> 28:14.986
I bet Mark Cuban would personally fund
the computer upgrades...

28:15.153 --> 28:16.821
...if you gave him free publicity.

28:16.988 --> 28:21.699
Is it really against national policy
to think outside the box?

28:22.533 --> 28:27.286
This isn't about beating up
on Homeland Security.

28:27.495 --> 28:31.206
Everybody knows they're trying.
I'm sure they're good people.

28:31.373 --> 28:36.668
But they simply cannot dispatch
a representative to this courtroom...

28:36.834 --> 28:39.169
...to say the problem isn't fixable...

28:39.378 --> 28:43.047
...while thousands of Americans
are being denied due process.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.548
It so easily has to be fixable.

28:45.757 --> 28:48.217
And in the meantime,
my client sits here today...

28:48.384 --> 28:53.680
...a law-abiding man, grounded,
while Bella lays writhing in Maui.

29:02.352 --> 29:04.353
Too long?

29:14.276 --> 29:16.069
- Stop it. I'm serious.
- Just one waft.

29:16.236 --> 29:17.987
Alan, I am not finding this amusing.

29:18.153 --> 29:21.197
I'm about to register you
as a sex offender.

29:22.198 --> 29:23.533
What?

29:23.700 --> 29:26.034
This time I detect
both Brad and Jeffrey.

29:27.284 --> 29:30.412
Denise, if it's a public course,
I should be allowed to play.

29:34.289 --> 29:37.750
Alan, let's go
to your office for a minute.

29:39.334 --> 29:41.336
Really?

29:50.634 --> 29:54.177
- Wanna pull out your 3 wood?
- I was thinking my sand wedge.

29:54.886 --> 29:57.263
- Let's go.
- Sorry?

29:57.471 --> 30:02.892
See, you like to talk. I don't.
I like to do.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.436
I also like to be spontaneous.

30:05.644 --> 30:07.186
What are you saying?

30:07.770 --> 30:11.815
I'm saying you've got five minutes.
Your desk looks available.

30:12.648 --> 30:16.901
- You wanna have sex on my desk?
- Right now.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.945
Surely, you jest?

30:22.405 --> 30:24.239
Don't you?

30:24.614 --> 30:27.992
I don't joke about sex.

30:28.826 --> 30:33.537
So we on the desk or not?

30:45.003 --> 30:47.088
You can tell Sally she was wrong.

30:48.172 --> 30:50.799
- Hey.
- No, no.

30:57.219 --> 31:01.181
Helen Choi was specifically trained
to use an EpiPen.

31:01.347 --> 31:04.349
She knew how critical
even a few lost seconds could be.

31:04.558 --> 31:07.643
She was on her cell phone,
against school policy...

31:07.852 --> 31:09.728
...had her back
turned to her students.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.271
She didn't notice Nate
when he first went down.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.981
And with anaphylactic shock...

31:14.148 --> 31:17.941
...the difference between life and death
is seconds.

31:18.150 --> 31:20.319
Now, if this
were an isolated incident...

31:20.527 --> 31:23.196
...if Nate had suffered
some sort of freak reaction...

31:23.404 --> 31:27.740
...I suppose we could all say,
"Well, sometimes bad things happen."

31:28.199 --> 31:32.035
But the reality is that kids
with special needs, with medical needs...

31:32.202 --> 31:34.369
...are now mainstreamed
in our public schools.

31:34.536 --> 31:38.623
Our teachers need to be vigilant,
and she wasn't.

31:38.789 --> 31:41.541
As a result, a little boy died.

31:42.208 --> 31:45.335
We need you to send a message,
not just to Helen Choi...

31:45.501 --> 31:49.379
...but to all teachers,
that this is not acceptable.

31:49.546 --> 31:52.173
Like Rachel Beckett said:

31:53.716 --> 31:55.967
"We trust you with our babies."

32:11.436 --> 32:15.521
Lawsuits are about allocating burden.

32:15.688 --> 32:17.940
For example,
we want our cars to be safer...

32:18.106 --> 32:20.567
...so we hit the manufacturers
with a judgment...

32:20.734 --> 32:23.819
...that makes it more cost-effective
to install the airbag.

32:24.027 --> 32:27.404
The problem here,
as Ms. Bixby correctly states...

32:27.571 --> 32:30.156
...is we have more and more
special-needs kids...

32:30.323 --> 32:32.116
...going into our public schools...

32:32.325 --> 32:34.826
...combined
with an unprecedented escalation...

32:34.993 --> 32:37.495
...in autoimmune diseases, autism.

32:37.703 --> 32:41.956
The peanut allergy alone
has doubled in recent years.

32:42.164 --> 32:45.083
So who do we heap
this responsibility on?

32:45.249 --> 32:48.168
Who else? The teachers.

32:48.335 --> 32:54.422
The average annual starting salary
for a teacher is $32,000.

32:55.090 --> 32:59.718
For that, we ask them to teach, police,
provide emotional and social guidance.

32:59.884 --> 33:02.595
In some schools,
they actually have to clean the toilets.

33:02.762 --> 33:04.930
Now, let's throw in healthcare.

33:05.097 --> 33:09.099
This teacher,
she works 65-hour weeks.

33:09.641 --> 33:11.975
In addition
to her actual classroom duties...

33:12.184 --> 33:15.061
...she teaches sex education
to the older kids.

33:15.228 --> 33:17.813
She teaches a standardized test
the school mandates...

33:17.979 --> 33:22.149
...in order to qualify for funding
under the No Child Left Behind Act.

33:22.316 --> 33:25.527
She spends another 10 hours a month
meeting with parents.

33:25.694 --> 33:30.780
She supervises extracurricular activities,
goes on overnight class trips...

33:30.988 --> 33:33.240
...cleans and disinfects toys, coaches.

33:33.407 --> 33:36.575
She teaches fire drills,
safety procedures, healthy eating habits.

33:36.742 --> 33:39.828
She's certified in CPR, first aid
and food sanitation.

33:39.994 --> 33:41.621
She is so over-extended...

33:41.787 --> 33:43.956
...that when her own father
had to undergo...

33:44.123 --> 33:48.125
...a life-threatening medical procedure,
she couldn't be at the hospital.

33:48.542 --> 33:52.795
So she called on her cell phone
to see if he had lived...

33:52.962 --> 33:54.879
...which he hadn't.

33:55.839 --> 33:57.798
She then turned away
from her students...

33:57.965 --> 34:00.550
...so as not to traumatize them
with her grief...

34:00.716 --> 34:03.343
...which as a teacher,
she was expected to internalize.

34:04.386 --> 34:06.846
She has no savings, no house.

34:07.054 --> 34:09.973
And today she's being sued
because, without her knowledge...

34:10.139 --> 34:12.808
...one of her students
snuck a bite-size candy bar...

34:12.975 --> 34:17.186
...containing traces of peanut
into her classroom.

34:18.103 --> 34:21.772
Now she's being publicly blamed
for the death of a child...

34:21.981 --> 34:26.609
...whose parents had the means
to implement a multitude of safeguards.

34:26.775 --> 34:30.820
They implemented none of them
except a teacher.

34:31.779 --> 34:33.572
Is it any wonder half our teachers...

34:33.737 --> 34:37.408
...are quitting the profession outright
within five years?

34:38.492 --> 34:40.659
Never mind who's going to handle
the EpiPen.

34:41.743 --> 34:43.078
Who's going to teach?

35:07.678 --> 35:09.596
Thank you.

35:09.971 --> 35:11.930
Clarence.

35:12.389 --> 35:16.642
I believe the deal was,
if I dish, you dish.

35:17.393 --> 35:19.936
So, what happened with Sandy?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.564
She just...

35:24.272 --> 35:27.733
She just didn't like me that way.

35:31.736 --> 35:34.404
Could I get you to look at me
for a second?

35:38.157 --> 35:40.366
There will be women who do.

35:44.036 --> 35:47.580
- Is that all?
- Yeah, that's all.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.047
Mr. Randolph,
I realize that Homeland Security...

36:01.213 --> 36:03.298
...has had a pretty rough go of late.

36:03.465 --> 36:06.759
And I certainly don't want to pile on.

36:06.926 --> 36:10.178
But I have to agree with Mr. Shore.

36:10.345 --> 36:15.932
Given the capacity of technology today,
this has to be a fixable problem.

36:16.098 --> 36:20.268
I don't think Mr. Crane should have to
sit around waiting for you to fix it.

36:20.435 --> 36:25.146
It is the order of this court that you
take the petitioner off the No Fly List.

36:25.313 --> 36:28.649
Or in the alternative, put him
on the list of those who can fly...

36:28.857 --> 36:30.983
...even though
they're on the No Fly List.

36:32.817 --> 36:34.569
We're adjourned.

36:36.737 --> 36:39.364
Mai tais, Bella.

36:39.530 --> 36:43.241
Midnight Hawaii time, my head
will be the center of a thigh sandwich.

36:43.617 --> 36:47.286
Due process does have its dividends.

36:47.453 --> 36:50.038
- Maybe you should come with.
- Forget it.

36:50.205 --> 36:53.499
I'm not getting sloppy seconds
after Bella...

36:53.706 --> 36:57.918
- Denny?
- Bethany, what a coincidence.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.877
Actually, not. I heard you were here.

37:01.087 --> 37:04.756
Listen, I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what you said.

37:04.964 --> 37:08.258
Never mind all the reasons
not to date somebody.

37:08.467 --> 37:14.221
What does your heart say?
Because mine says to give this a chance.

37:16.013 --> 37:18.264
Can I take you to dinner?

37:18.890 --> 37:21.141
Well, actually, I'm getting
on a plane tonight.

37:21.350 --> 37:24.227
- Where are you going?
- Hawaii.

37:26.062 --> 37:28.063
I see.

37:28.772 --> 37:34.526
- With somebody?
- Well, actually...

37:35.068 --> 37:36.193
...yes.

37:38.070 --> 37:40.321
Is it my mother?

37:40.738 --> 37:44.157
Technically, yes.

37:46.242 --> 37:48.034
I see.

37:50.036 --> 37:52.496
Have a lovely time.

37:52.663 --> 37:54.622
Sorry to bother you.

38:00.668 --> 38:04.003
Denny, I'm a fairly staunch advocate
of telling the truth.

38:04.170 --> 38:07.089
But sometimes,
it's more humane to lie.

38:07.256 --> 38:09.215
I felt like a deer in the headlights.

38:09.549 --> 38:11.967
I hope I didn't hurt her.

38:12.384 --> 38:14.969
At least my mother taught me
how to tackle.

38:15.761 --> 38:18.930
Goodbye, Denny Crane.

38:19.139 --> 38:21.974
And tell Bella
she better watch her back.

38:28.395 --> 38:29.979
That is one tough broad.

38:40.611 --> 38:43.905
Mr. Foreman,
the jury has reached a verdict?

38:44.114 --> 38:46.907
- We have, Your Honor.
- What say you?

38:47.116 --> 38:50.701
<i>In the matter of The Estate
of Nathaniel Beckett v. Helen Choi...</i>

38:50.868 --> 38:54.704
...we, the jury, find
in favor of the defendant.

38:54.871 --> 38:57.080
Thank you for your service.
You're dismissed.

38:57.247 --> 38:59.499
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

38:59.665 --> 39:02.625
- Thank you both so, so much.
- Congratulations.

39:02.792 --> 39:05.295
We can help you get reinstated
if you like.

39:06.670 --> 39:10.548
Thank you, but my brother-in-law
has a real-estate business.

39:10.756 --> 39:13.425
And, well, I decided to go
for my broker's license.

39:15.843 --> 39:19.554
- Okay.
- Yeah. It's a really exciting opportunity.

39:19.762 --> 39:23.639
And I'd be crazy not to take it.
There's room for growth and...

39:24.223 --> 39:28.435
You know, I think it might be something
I'd enjoy. So I figured, why not? Right?

39:28.602 --> 39:29.935
Yeah.

39:43.236 --> 39:46.697
- What time's your flight?
- Nine.

39:46.864 --> 39:49.324
You can still change your mind.

39:50.824 --> 39:54.910
I'm sure by now Mr. Winchell
has added my name to the No Fly List.

39:55.077 --> 39:57.412
Alan, I'm grateful
for everything you did...

39:57.579 --> 40:00.289
...but I wasn't crazy about you
attacking the government.

40:01.290 --> 40:04.542
Don't be silly.
I'm sure you were a little crazy.

40:05.293 --> 40:08.003
I agree with a lot
of what Randolph said in his closing.

40:08.170 --> 40:10.963
People in this country
gotta sacrifice more.

40:11.172 --> 40:15.257
Is that why you're flying commercial
and not taking your Gulfstream?

40:15.883 --> 40:18.635
It doesn't do any good
to sit back and criticize.

40:18.843 --> 40:20.511
Sometimes it does, Denny.

40:21.595 --> 40:25.056
Sometimes the most patriotic thing
you can do is criticize.

40:25.222 --> 40:29.184
Liberty in this country was founded
on that very ideal.

40:29.392 --> 40:34.270
How did it happen that dissent
became some form of heresy?

40:34.437 --> 40:38.273
Well, I'm all for dissent
when I'm sure I'm right.

40:41.983 --> 40:44.361
Denny, I'm not sure
I've ever told you this...

40:44.526 --> 40:46.320
...but I truly love America.

40:46.987 --> 40:49.989
I would never consider
living anywhere else.

40:50.198 --> 40:54.325
But this country's only 200 years old.
It's a work in progress, especially lately.

40:54.533 --> 40:58.912
All right, Mr. Smarty-Pants.
You get to change one thing. What is it?

40:59.120 --> 41:01.372
Get rid of all stores
that end with "mart."

41:02.538 --> 41:06.792
- Besides that.
- One change.

41:08.335 --> 41:11.295
Well, first, I'd like to stop people
from passing off...

41:11.503 --> 41:14.214
...narrow-mindedness
and intolerance as family values.

41:14.381 --> 41:17.216
No, no, no.
That's political, doesn't count.

41:17.715 --> 41:22.594
Name a change that relates to this issue.
Government technology.

41:23.178 --> 41:24.970
I made that suggestion in court.

41:25.137 --> 41:28.556
Hire the geniuses, not the guy
who's got the best lobbyist...

41:28.765 --> 41:32.142
...or the rich friend
who'll take you to his quail ranch...

41:32.309 --> 41:35.644
...and let you shoot him.
Hire the thinkers.

41:35.811 --> 41:37.437
- The Steves?
- For a start.

41:37.646 --> 41:41.315
Instead of every Tom, Dick and Brownie,
let's turn our visionaries loose.

41:41.523 --> 41:43.900
At the very least,
we'll be rid of those stores...

41:44.067 --> 41:47.152
...where you can buy both meat
and CDs.

41:47.361 --> 41:49.779
- What would you change?
- Not a thing.

41:49.987 --> 41:52.197
- Not a thing?
- This country works, Alan.

41:52.405 --> 41:55.741

I'm not saying there aren't kinks.

41:55.950 --> 41:58.535
Foam chips off
the occasional spacecraft...

41:58.701 --> 42:00.744
...we start the odd war
on false pretenses.

42:00.911 --> 42:04.163
But by and large, America works.

42:05.789 --> 42:09.291
That's why
I'm completely nuts about it.

42:12.126 --> 42:14.753
- To Denny Crane.
- Completely nuts.
