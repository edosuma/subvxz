Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, 1988, Day 1

01:16.920 --> 01:19.320
- Don't cry, please.

01:19.320 --> 01:23.240
Two years.
It's only two years.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.200
- Vorobiov! 
- Yes.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.040
- Tchougaïnov! 
- Yes.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.160
I have to go now.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.120
- Is Riabokon here? 
- There he goes, they`re carry him

01:43.040 --> 01:46.960
The enemies will not pass!

01:47.800 --> 01:51.720
Mama!

01:52.320 --> 01:54.920
Well, it's time to say goodbye.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.120
This is for you.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.040
My brothers, the border is locked
and the key is in the pocket.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.480
Come on! Go! Quick!

02:09.160 --> 02:11.160
Put your stuff on the table! 

02:12.320 --> 02:16.240
Bags here! 
Beer, vodka and other booze on the table!

02:17.320 --> 02:21.240
Is she your girlfriend?
Have you fucked her at least for one last time?

02:22.800 --> 02:25.720
What? She didn`t want?

02:26.920 --> 02:30.720
All right, don`t worry.
Everything will be all right.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.520
There are many nice guys out here
that`ll take care of her

02:33.520 --> 02:36.720
- What's this? 
- Paint.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.640
Soldier, what are you going to draw there?
Wheels of tanks?

02:41.120 --> 02:44.320
You might also have brought 
a easel painter.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.440
Gioconda.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.040
Next.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.960
You think she's gonna wait for you?
While you`ll write her love letters, she'll be fucking with her two holes.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.800
What do you want from me?
What have I done to you?

02:55.800 --> 02:59.720
Oh, you find your voice! 
So, you wanna punch me in the face? Come on.

03:00.600 --> 03:04.520
Come here! Jerk!

03:27.320 --> 03:31.240
Relax son. 
I'm gonna make you a real Soldier.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.920
Do you know the first rule in the army?

03:35.920 --> 03:39.840
Soldiers should firmly endure the toughness 
and difficulties of the army life.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.720
Say, why you wear a suit?
You think this is a party?

03:46.800 --> 03:47.720
I have no other clothes.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.640
Let's switch.
I'll give you mine, plus cigarettes.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.520
You don't need them anymore, right? 
And I need go out to the city, to the disco and girls

03:56.520 --> 03:58.800
Can you understand?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.040
Yes, nice service you got.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.960
You bet. It's like a beautiful dream 
which you don't wanna wake up from.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.040
So, deal?

04:08.040 --> 04:11.040
- Of course.
- Great!

04:11.040 --> 04:14.960
- Take the sheet away
- Sure.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.360
- Beautiful dream, you say?
- Yeah

04:25.600 --> 04:28.040
- Hey you! What you are doing?
- Hold it motherfuckers!

04:28.040 --> 04:31.960
Hold it, I said!

04:32.120 --> 04:35.120
Relax son.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.720
- Stop it! 
- What you said about enduring toughness and difficulties, huh?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.040
Let go of me, bastard!
Let go

04:39.040 --> 04:40.920
Remember?
Can you remember?

04:40.920 --> 04:44.840
Can you remember?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.800
Finish your hair yourself

05:08.120 --> 05:11.120
Guys, is this the 6th unit?

05:11.120 --> 05:13.920
And where you think you going Rambo? 
Piss off!

05:13.920 --> 05:15.720
- Chill out, Chugun. 
- What?

05:15.720 --> 05:18.920
Nothing. 
Your name is?

05:18.920 --> 05:21.720
Volodia Vorobiov

05:21.720 --> 05:25.640
Loutaïev Oleg, for short: Louti (Fierce)

05:25.920 --> 05:29.840
This is Ruslan, the Gioconda

05:31.320 --> 05:32.720
Stas, Seri

05:32.720 --> 05:33.440
It's good to see you.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.520
Volodia

05:35.520 --> 05:39.440
Riaba (Pocky), Chougoun(Pig-iron)

05:42.600 --> 05:45.120
Move, mate

05:45.120 --> 05:47.600
Sit, Vorobey (Sparrow)

05:47.600 --> 05:51.320
Continue, Riaba

05:51.320 --> 05:54.120
I wake up in the morning

05:54.120 --> 05:55.600
My head's exploding

05:55.600 --> 06:01.520
Open my eyes with my fingers, look around...
Whatta hell's this house?

06:01.940 --> 06:04.610
How the hell did I get here?

06:05.020 --> 06:06.370
Next to me sat a girl.

06:06.610 --> 06:07.550
Smiling

06:07.605 --> 06:08.900
Naked!

06:09.200 --> 06:10.320
Woo-hoo.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.440
And her father stands me, 
like above a dead man in a coffin

06:12.440 --> 06:16.360
He says: "my boy, you real fucked up, and she hasn`t even 18.
So decide, either the registry office for marriage,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.200
or the police".

06:20.200 --> 06:23.600
And the slut covered her tits with a blanket,
and looks innocently

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
Like nothing happened.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.520
And ugly....
Like a bulldog.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.920
And I said no, dear father

06:31.920 --> 06:33.200
I would rather lie under a tank.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.200
than with her.
Then I grabbed my feet and start running.

06:36.200 --> 06:40.120
Hoping I got here first,
before him getting to the police station.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.320
And I got married yesterday.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.120
The wedding and the goodbye ceremony.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.040
What? Congratulations!

06:47.040 --> 06:50.120
Pretty boy.

06:50.120 --> 06:54.040
Allright, she said: 
"now I am yours, come, I`am your wife".

06:54.200 --> 06:58.120
She thinks I am a fool.
I open the door and be out for 2 years, while she hangs around.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.800
She cried all night long.
Married and I didn't touch her.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.720
But I said to her: "when I get back.
I will check it and see"

07:06.920 --> 07:10.840
And if you aren`t a virgin anymore, 
I'll kill you bitch

07:13.720 --> 07:15.800
That`s what I left.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.600
That's him. That one.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.200
Wearing a suit.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.040
What's wrong with you sucker?
Who are you pointing at?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.800
Quiet, quiet.
Go have a rest.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.720
I'll punch your head myself!
These are Afghans Units you idiot!

07:28.040 --> 07:31.320
Come here jerk!

07:31.320 --> 07:35.240
Ahh... Oh...

09:44.840 --> 09:49.840
Fergana, Uzbekistan, Day 3

09:52.320 --> 09:56.240
Where are you from?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I am from Grozny.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.720
Where?

10:00.720 --> 10:03.720
Grozny

10:03.720 --> 10:07.720
From Grozny.
So you'll be called Pinochet from now on.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.000
- What?
- Pinochet.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.720
Why Pinochet?

10:12.720 --> 10:16.640
I don't know. Why not Pinochet?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.920
Is he coming for us?

10:30.320 --> 10:32.480
What a face.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.000
Where are you from, clowns?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.600
From Siberia,
Comrade Commander.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.000
I am Lieutenant Dygalo

10:40.000 --> 10:42.320
What?

10:42.320 --> 10:45.600
Are you hard of hearing?
Get up!

10:45.600 --> 10:47.480
Get up quickly!

10:47.480 --> 10:49.000
Stand in a line! Quickly!

10:49.000 --> 10:52.880
Put your hats on

10:52.880 --> 10:55.200
In line! Attention!

10:55.200 --> 10:58.720
I don't think there's any blinds here.
These mountains are ours.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.720
Beyond it is Afghan.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.640
And for you not to die,
on the first day you get there

11:05.320 --> 11:09.240
I will train you for 3 months,
24 hours a day.

11:10.200 --> 11:15.270
From this minute on. 
Any questions?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
No questions.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.880
Turn right.

11:21.880 --> 11:25.800
Follow me to our camp.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.880
Run

11:27.880 --> 11:30.760
When I order to run,
you should bend your arms!

11:30.760 --> 11:34.680
Go!

11:46.720 --> 11:48.080
Name? 

11:48.080 --> 11:51.480
Private Riabokon

11:51.480 --> 11:54.200
- Name?
- Private Tchougaïnov

11:54.200 --> 11:58.200
The girdle is not
for holding the balls, Soldier.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.480
- Name? 
- Private Bekbulatov.

12:01.480 --> 12:05.400
- N...
- Private Stasenko

12:06.000 --> 12:08.880
Private Petrovsky

12:08.880 --> 12:09.720
It's you, our painter?

12:09.720 --> 12:11.000
It's me, Comrade Lieutenant.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.600
What are you doing here, son?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.400
Should`ve stay at home.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.320
To draw naked women 
or flowers in gardens

12:21.000 --> 12:23.600
You see, Comrade Lieutenant,
accordingly to dr. Freud

12:23.600 --> 12:27.520
Any painting is a sublimation of
subconscious instincts.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.720
Including the instinct of violence.
But you can disagree with this.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.400
Because Soviet science does not recognize 
the bourgeois doctrine of dr. Freud.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.480
Very clever.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.400
Sorry, I'll fix it with your help, 
Comrade Lieutenant.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.720
Rule No.1

12:46.720 --> 12:50.640
Paratroppers should be always ready 
for a sudden attack.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.720
Very good. Name.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.000
Private Lutaïev

12:57.000 --> 12:58.800
Rule No.2

12:58.800 --> 13:02.000
Brighter than a Lieutenant  
is only the First Lieutenant 

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Forget who you were and what you knew.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.720
Remember well, clowns!

13:06.720 --> 13:09.000
Here, you`re neither good or bad.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.920
No bright nor stupid, not even a painter. 
Here, you are nothing!

13:13.880 --> 13:17.800
You are not even humans.
Here you are shit.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.920
I'm the one who will make humans of you,
using these very hands

13:23.400 --> 13:24.600
Clear?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.080
Yes, sir!

13:26.080 --> 13:28.080
I did not hear it.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.320
Yes, sir.

13:29.320 --> 13:29.720
Louder.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.400
Yes sir!

13:31.400 --> 13:34.320
Fill it up!

13:34.320 --> 13:38.200
Comrade Lieutenant, 
the first unit runs with light equipment.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.800
With your girlfriend, 
who can run to the bushes with light equipment.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.720
Here, the more ammo you bring, 
the more chances you have to survive.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.800
The mission is,
to beat the armed enemy.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.720
Take the height, confirm your position,
and report me the situation.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.320
Comrade Lieutenant. 
The second unit is ready.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.480
The preparation of the mission is complete.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.800
Stand up.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.720
Run, forward!

14:25.400 --> 14:29.000
Forward, forward.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.920
Forward.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.880
The mission failed

14:46.880 --> 14:50.600
You are all corps.
You, you and you.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.080
Cargo 200 in the black tulip.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.000
A piece of shit in a zinc coffin.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.320
The convoy which passes by 

14:59.320 --> 15:01.800
has fallen in a enemy ambush

15:01.800 --> 15:05.000
You know what's the meaning 
of a machine-gun?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.800
Up there, on the height?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.000
Huh!

15:08.000 --> 15:08.800
Do you know?

15:08.800 --> 15:12.720
Get up, dead men,
put on your helmets. Run Down

15:13.080 --> 15:17.000
I said run! Run!

15:28.800 --> 15:32.720
I wish I was already in Afghanistan.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.600
Sparrow.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.400
What do you want?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.720
Take my dick to piss
I`m so tired that I can't get up

15:41.720 --> 15:45.640
Him? Nah...
He`ll overstrain himself.

15:53.080 --> 15:57.000
Look! Snow White!

15:57.200 --> 15:59.720
Come over here.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.080
Snow White.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.600
Snow White, come over here, sit with us.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.520
Snow White, come here.
Come over here. Don't be afraid.

16:11.320 --> 16:14.600
Dammit, now it'll stand till next morning.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.400
Who's her?

16:16.400 --> 16:22.420
Were you born yesterday?
She is Snow White, the paramedic's daughter.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.000
Half of Afghanistan have fucked her

16:25.000 --> 16:28.920
They say she's hot.
You don`t fuck her, she fucks you.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.320
There's a disease like that.
How do you call it?

16:32.320 --> 16:35.800
Get lost, scholar.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.400
Could you try to arrange it with her?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.000
Why arrange?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.920
She's non-refusable, just like a Kalashnikov gun.
Grab and go

16:43.360 --> 16:45.360
How we gonna get her through two sentinels?

16:47.720 --> 16:49.720
Stop Guys. Let´s forget it.

16:50.020 --> 16:53.620
The previous call up 
is leaving in a couple of days.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.320
And we will stay here
for three months.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.320
If we get caught,
it's your end.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.240
Listen, Lutyi. 
Would you sleep with her, after fourty men?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.000
No.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Me neither. 
It's better to burst with hunger than eat from garbage cans.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.920
Yeah?
But I ate. I ate.

17:20.079 --> 17:23.599
Have you ever been starving so bad,
that you can't even sleep?

17:23.599 --> 17:25.480
So shut the fuck up your mouth!

17:25.480 --> 17:27.599
For us the dinner was three spoons
of carpenters glue.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.400
And after eating that 
we would wandering through the city

17:29.400 --> 17:32.880
Looking how those like you 
sit there in a restaurant with their bitches

17:32.880 --> 17:36.800
Hoping to get your leftovers after! 
Do you get it?

17:36.800 --> 17:39.000
And the bitches I had were all like her.
I can't have something else, fuckface

17:39.000 --> 17:40.480
Guys, that´s enought.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.000
Shut up!
First smell a woman, then talk.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Enough! Calm down!

17:44.000 --> 17:47.080
Why I shoud calm myself?
You don't touch mine

17:47.080 --> 17:49.320
and I won't touch yours, understood?

17:49.320 --> 17:50.480
Pick from the garbage cans...

17:50.480 --> 17:53.400
Maybe she's better
than all your rich sluts.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.320
You bastard, one more word from you
and you'll eat shit. Got it?

18:00.080 --> 18:03.080
What is a Soviet Paratropper?

18:03.080 --> 18:04.880
A Soviet Paratropper

18:04.880 --> 18:09.880
is the glory, the power and pride 
of the military forces

18:13.320 --> 18:16.600
What is a Soviet Paratropper?

18:16.600 --> 18:20.520
A Soviet Paratropper is the assurance
of all units and people

18:24.480 --> 18:27.400
Who the hell are you?

18:27.400 --> 18:31.320
We are the shame of all units 
and you personally.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.880
Listen.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.600
Listen, he is an idiot.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.520
Nah, he's cool
I don't get only one thing.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.000
Why the first unit is
always in the front?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.800
They run with light equipment,
and have an hour to sit and moke.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.880
While we eat shit here.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.200
We have done nothing bad.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.880
Should be by turns. 
One time for them, one time for us.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.080
Yes, is because their Lieutenant is sane.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.000
And us, we have this idiot Dygalo!

19:07.320 --> 19:11.240
Making his ranks on us

19:11.600 --> 19:14.200
No, in fact, he was hurt badly.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.880
in the head

19:16.880 --> 19:18.880
He lost all his men
in Afghanistan

19:18.880 --> 19:22.800
He's the only one who survived.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.160
He's been reassigned here

19:27.400 --> 19:30.400
But he writes to the minister,
wants to go back

19:30.400 --> 19:33.360
But with his head injury,
who needs him there? 

19:33.520 --> 19:35.520
So he's going mad on us.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.120
We are in the deep shit guys.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.880
Company get up!

19:51.880 --> 19:53.880
Put on your uniform

19:53.880 --> 19:56.320
Stand in line

19:56.320 --> 20:00.200
Why you move like a pregnant women?
I don't get it!

20:01.800 --> 20:03.880
What's taking so long?

20:03.880 --> 20:07.200
You are not Soldiers,
but pregnant cockroaches!

20:08.800 --> 20:10.320
What's the matter girls?
Is it too heavy?

20:10.320 --> 20:12.000
Is because of your skirts?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.480
What the hell is this line?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.600
Dismissed!

20:15.600 --> 20:18.480
Dismissed!

20:18.480 --> 20:21.720
Come on, help your wearing muscles!

20:21.720 --> 20:23.720
Company get up!

20:23.720 --> 20:27.640
Get up!

20:28.200 --> 20:30.600
How do you want to fight like this?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.400
Return, clowns

20:35.600 --> 20:37.480
Take along Tchougaïnov

20:37.480 --> 20:39.320
Run

20:41.800 --> 20:43.600
Go!

20:43.600 --> 20:46.720
Dismissed

20:46.720 --> 20:48.600
Lower, lower!

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
Keep your ass lower, dammit!

20:50.600 --> 20:52.600
Company stand up!

20:52.600 --> 20:55.320
Stand up!

20:55.320 --> 20:58.800
Lower you head, lower

21:00.200 --> 21:01.720
Raising your head like this
is a gift for the snipers

21:01.720 --> 21:04.320
And your mothers will get obituaries!

21:04.320 --> 21:05.320
I said faster!

21:05.320 --> 21:06.400
Faster!

21:08.140 --> 21:10.140
Dismissed

21:21.880 --> 21:25.800
Turn back

21:36.000 --> 21:39.920
You screwed Soldier,
after dismissed come to my office

22:02.720 --> 22:06.640
Company get up!
Run!

22:11.800 --> 22:15.720
Raise your weapon!

22:33.800 --> 22:37.720
Faster!

23:05.400 --> 23:08.000
Second squad, come back!

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Run back!

23:11.000 --> 23:14.320
Lutaev, Ryabokon, pick up the Soldier

23:14.320 --> 23:18.080
Remember,
never leave your Soldiers behind

23:18.080 --> 23:22.000
Forward! I said forward! 

23:30.320 --> 23:34.000
10 minutes rest

23:34.000 --> 23:36.200
Take it!

23:36.200 --> 23:40.120
Shithead!

23:43.800 --> 23:47.720
Tell me Sparrow, do I need to
carry you like this every time?

23:48.320 --> 23:51.400
I got enough shit of my own

23:51.400 --> 23:53.400
So, kill me, come on,
kill me!

23:53.400 --> 23:57.320
Cool off!

23:58.720 --> 24:02.640
I can't stand it anymore! 

24:02.800 --> 24:06.720
Then fuck off, if you cant´t stand it step forward 
and tell everyone about it, the ceremony is tomorrow

24:06.880 --> 24:10.480
Yeah, I will tell!
What?! You despise me?!

24:10.480 --> 24:14.400
I don't give a shit,
I don't care.

24:15.600 --> 24:19.520
Olga's waiting there for you,
she can't wait anymore

24:24.320 --> 24:27.400
Tomorrow I quit too, guys

24:27.400 --> 24:30.320
Got a letter from my mom

24:30.320 --> 24:34.240
It's been a while already,
she is sick

24:36.480 --> 24:40.000
If I die,
she`ll have no one

24:40.000 --> 24:43.600
I didn't want to be 
the first to quit

24:43.600 --> 24:47.520
Ok, guys.
Is there someone else who wants to leave?

24:48.200 --> 24:50.400
I heard from the first call up

24:50.400 --> 24:54.320
In Afghanistan you make one week out 
and two at the base 

24:57.800 --> 25:01.720
And here Dygalo will finish you, 
even before you get to war.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.200
He'll break you.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.120
What do you say, Riaba?

25:12.320 --> 25:15.320
Sparrow, then we decided

25:15.320 --> 25:19.240
We quit together, ok?

25:23.400 --> 25:27.320
Eyes to the center, attention!

25:33.720 --> 25:36.080
Comrade Colonel, 

25:36.080 --> 25:39.000
The regiment is ready.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.320
- Hello, Comrades Paratroopers
- Salut, Comrade Colonel

25:45.800 --> 25:49.720
At ease

25:49.880 --> 25:53.800
Everyone of you, voluntarily

25:55.800 --> 25:58.080
has made a decision to serve in Afghanistan

25:58.080 --> 26:02.000
Now I must ask you one question:

26:02.320 --> 26:06.240
Is there anyone who has changed his mind?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.320
I`ll not ask why

26:08.320 --> 26:12.240
Your will be merely reassigned 
to another territorial division

26:15.800 --> 26:19.720
Who doesn't want to go to Afghanistan?

26:56.880 --> 27:00.320
I thank you for your engagement

27:00.320 --> 27:04.240
I serve the Soviet Union!

27:08.600 --> 27:09.880
Harder!

27:09.880 --> 27:12.400
Harder!

27:12.400 --> 27:15.320
It ain't no girl but a machine gun!

27:15.320 --> 27:18.480
Kill him

27:18.480 --> 27:22.400
Kill him! Don't fear
Kill!

27:22.600 --> 27:26.000
You only have one strike
to save your ass!

27:26.000 --> 27:27.200
Crush the ribs, rip the guts!

27:27.200 --> 27:28.720
Take'em down

27:28.720 --> 27:30.080
Give it to me, look!

27:30.080 --> 27:31.320
Like this!

27:31.320 --> 27:34.200
Like this, kill him!

27:34.200 --> 27:36.000
Come, Soldier, kill him!

27:36.000 --> 27:37.600
Kill!

27:37.600 --> 27:38.720
Vorobyov!

27:38.720 --> 27:39.600
Yes.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.400
Come here!

27:40.400 --> 27:42.080
Yes, Comrade Lieutenant

27:42.080 --> 27:43.320
Stasenko.

27:43.320 --> 27:47.240
Come here!
Take off your weapon and put down your bag.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.880
Fast!

27:49.880 --> 27:51.600
Soldiers

27:51.600 --> 27:54.720
Take the stuff away

27:54.720 --> 27:57.600
Beat him,
punch him in the face!

27:57.600 --> 28:01.600
You are going to war,
do it!

28:01.600 --> 28:04.800
That's how you pet your girlfriend
has a civilian?

28:04.800 --> 28:08.720
Punch his mouth!

28:08.880 --> 28:12.800
Stronger, quick! 
Both of you!

28:13.400 --> 28:14.800
Sparrow,
Hit first!

28:14.800 --> 28:17.400
Yeah, that's it!

28:17.400 --> 28:19.000
Come on Sparrow!

28:19.000 --> 28:21.600
Don't back off, without fear!

28:21.600 --> 28:25.520
One more!

28:27.400 --> 28:29.880
Get up!

28:29.880 --> 28:32.480
Come on Sparrow, hold on!

28:32.480 --> 28:36.400
Get up!

28:36.800 --> 28:39.800
Come on, come on!

28:39.800 --> 28:42.400
Come on, more!

28:42.400 --> 28:46.320
Get up Soldier, punch him!

28:59.600 --> 29:03.520
Finish him, Stas!

29:09.800 --> 29:11.480
Get up! 
When he falls down, finish him!

29:11.480 --> 29:15.400
Only dead man 
won't shoot you in the back

29:16.480 --> 29:19.200
Sorry Sparrow, forgive me

29:19.200 --> 29:23.120
Well done Sparrow!

29:34.000 --> 29:37.920
Let's continue.

29:40.800 --> 29:44.720
Looks like plasticine

29:46.320 --> 29:47.720
Everybody can touch it

29:48.800 --> 29:50.880
Touch it, feel it

29:50.880 --> 29:51.720
You see how it's soft

29:53.600 --> 29:56.600
It can take any form,

30:00.080 --> 30:02.080
like a harmless toy, 
which everyone of you had

30:02.080 --> 30:06.000
Every one of you`ve molded,
squirrels, rabbits...

30:06.720 --> 30:09.000
But in a fact, in your hands

30:09.000 --> 30:12.920
you hold a powerful weapon

30:13.480 --> 30:17.400
Plastic explosive

30:18.000 --> 30:20.760
Stas!

30:20.760 --> 30:24.680
It has it`s chemical formula

30:24.800 --> 30:27.400
But you do not need to know this

30:27.400 --> 30:31.200
Plastid is irreplaceable,

30:31.200 --> 30:37.120
that`s why we find him 
in the equipement of every Paratropper

30:37.200 --> 30:41.120
One question: why?

30:43.320 --> 30:47.240
First, in this condition

30:49.200 --> 30:54.120
It's absolutely safe, easy to store 
and always available

30:54.600 --> 30:58.520
Like we say, 
one has it in the pocket.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.880
But in combat

31:01.880 --> 31:03.400
It is very effective

31:03.400 --> 31:07.320
and has enormous destructive power

31:07.320 --> 31:12.240
But you've got to be skilled
for using it

31:12.320 --> 31:16.240
Soldiers

31:17.880 --> 31:21.800
There are two simple rules
you must know:

31:25.400 --> 31:30.320
First, the more you squeeze it,
the more it blows

31:30.800 --> 31:34.720
Number two,
don't stick it everywhere!

31:36.320 --> 31:40.200
But by itself this thing won't work

31:40.200 --> 31:43.080
For it to blow we need what?

31:43.080 --> 31:46.040
A detonator.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.880
Exactly.

31:47.880 --> 31:51.800
We need to insert a detonator.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.080
Your name Soldier?

32:14.080 --> 32:16.600
Soldier Petrovsky

32:16.600 --> 32:20.520
You screwed, Soldier.
I'll report to your Commander.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.600
Yes

32:33.600 --> 32:36.000
Comrade Lieutenant, Private Petrovsky

32:36.000 --> 32:39.920
Come in.

32:45.320 --> 32:49.240
Well molded, quite realistic.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.480
Can you paint?

33:00.480 --> 33:04.400
I learned painting.

33:06.080 --> 33:10.000
A portrait, kind of big

33:11.000 --> 33:14.920
I could...

33:18.080 --> 33:22.000
A woman has write to me...

33:25.320 --> 33:29.240
We met before the war

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
She wants my photo

33:33.080 --> 33:37.000
What am I going to do?
Send it with my scar?

33:38.000 --> 33:41.920
Can you, like... without... 
the scar and more handsome?

33:44.480 --> 33:47.320
Yes, I just need some time,
a couple of days

33:52.600 --> 33:56.520
I certainly won't go to
see her after the war

34:01.720 --> 34:05.640
Just let her write for the meanwhile

34:12.800 --> 34:15.080
Attention!

34:15.080 --> 34:19.000
Go!

34:19.800 --> 34:23.719
Goddam tanks...

34:52.199 --> 34:56.120
Eat this!

35:04.600 --> 35:08.520
Look!

35:08.800 --> 35:11.480
He pissed his pants

35:11.480 --> 35:15.400
You laugh? 
I sleep just under him!

35:16.200 --> 35:19.800
So sparrow, 
do I need to sleep now with a umbrella?

35:19.800 --> 35:21.200
I don't get it, Soldier

35:21.200 --> 35:22.320
Did you see something?

35:22.320 --> 35:23.720
Nothing, Comrade Lieutenant

35:23.720 --> 35:24.880
And you?

35:24.880 --> 35:26.200
I misunderstood, Comrade Lieutenant

35:26.200 --> 35:27.480
Then tell me what's it all about!

35:27.480 --> 35:30.400
I also wanna share you joy

35:30.400 --> 35:32.400
You can swallow your snots,
call your mother

35:33.600 --> 35:36.000
or piss your pants, 
but your mission must be accomplished

35:36.000 --> 35:39.920
Die but do it, and he did 

35:41.200 --> 35:45.120
Turn back! March!

36:04.000 --> 36:07.880
Some basic knowledge of 
your communication with the locals

36:07.880 --> 36:11.800
you`ll get from this handbook

36:12.200 --> 36:15.480
But,

36:15.480 --> 36:19.400
the first thing you should remember,
when you cross the border,

36:19.880 --> 36:23.800
is that you're in a muslim country

36:27.800 --> 36:31.720
Islam it's not merely another religion

36:32.400 --> 36:34.480
It's another world with its own laws

36:34.480 --> 36:38.400
Another approach to life and death

36:42.600 --> 36:46.000
A muslim isn`t afraid to die fighting the infidel, 
and that`s what we are for them

36:46.000 --> 36:49.920
If he gets killed 
he goes straight to heaven

36:52.720 --> 36:56.640
Where all he has missing in this life
is awaiting him there

36:56.800 --> 36:58.880
Water

36:58.880 --> 37:02.800
Gardens full of fruits,
beautiful maids

37:06.720 --> 37:10.640
How Muslims treat women
it's another topic

37:13.600 --> 37:17.520
The most important holy thing for muslim 
is his house or "Harram"

37:18.000 --> 37:21.400
From which derived the word "Harem"

37:21.400 --> 37:25.320
The word has a second meaning which is
"forbidden", "prohibited"

37:27.000 --> 37:29.480
Looking at the muslim women is harram

37:29.480 --> 37:31.880
Everything regarding sex is harram

37:31.880 --> 37:34.720
Is harram to show a muslim indecent gestures,

37:34.720 --> 37:37.000
those you all are so used to

37:37.000 --> 37:40.080
For this you can get a bullet,
even from a common peasant

37:40.080 --> 37:44.000
Another important thing,
a muslim will never profane his house with blood

37:46.240 --> 37:50.160
That means when you enter their village, 
you are their guests

37:50.320 --> 37:54.240
To kill a guest,
even an infidel, is harram

37:56.080 --> 38:00.000
So, you must remember this one:

38:00.000 --> 38:03.480
as long as you're in the village,
you`re safe.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.720
But after you crossed
the borderline of the village

38:06.720 --> 38:10.400
The same man, 
who's been drinking tea with you 5 minutes ago,

38:10.400 --> 38:14.000
may shoot you in the back

38:14.000 --> 38:17.920
Because it is a glory 
to kill an infidel

38:20.000 --> 38:23.920
Is a staircase to heaven.

38:27.200 --> 38:31.120
I'm telling it for you, Soldier

38:31.720 --> 38:35.640
Ah...

38:38.400 --> 38:42.320
Also, Afghanistan is a 
multinational country.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.200
Over 20 nations live there.

38:50.200 --> 38:53.200
Tajiks, Turkmen, Uzbeks

38:53.200 --> 38:55.600
Pushtuns along the Pakistan border

38:55.600 --> 38:59.520
In the north Khazars,
since the mongol invasion

39:05.400 --> 39:09.320
The word khazar means 
"thousand" in turkish language.

39:11.720 --> 39:15.640
Am I boring you, Soldier?

39:17.880 --> 39:21.800
Comrade Captain, 
does it matter who you shoot?

39:24.480 --> 39:28.400
During the whole history

39:29.400 --> 39:33.320
No one ever succeded to conquer Afghanistan

39:35.880 --> 39:39.800
No one, ever

39:51.320 --> 39:54.200
Squad, get up!

39:54.200 --> 39:57.720
What are we doing in Afghanistan?

39:57.720 --> 40:01.640
Fulfilling our international duty,
and help our Afghan brothers

40:01.880 --> 40:06.800
to resist the aggression of imperialism.

40:07.880 --> 40:11.800
Fire!

40:13.320 --> 40:16.080
Soldier Riabokon
Done!

40:16.080 --> 40:17.400
Private Tchougaïnov 
Done!

40:17.400 --> 40:18.600
Lower

40:18.600 --> 40:22.520
You pull the trigger too sharp

40:23.000 --> 40:26.920
Very dense, but too high.
Breath slowly.

40:33.080 --> 40:37.000
Ok

40:47.400 --> 40:48.720
Have you ever shot before?

40:48.720 --> 40:51.880
No Comrade Lieutenant, 
I'm a painter and I`ve a accurate eye

40:53.600 --> 40:55.400
Over here.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.600
Yes sir

40:58.600 --> 41:01.320
Give him.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.400
Private Vorobyov

41:02.400 --> 41:03.320
Yes

41:03.320 --> 41:04.600
Put down the gun 
and come here.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.800
Yes, Comrade Lieutenant!

41:07.800 --> 41:10.080
Here. Put it there.

41:10.080 --> 41:10.600
Yes, Comrade Lieutenant!

41:10.600 --> 41:14.520
Run!

41:47.800 --> 41:50.800
Oh! Not bad, Gioconda

41:50.800 --> 41:54.800
Good!

41:54.800 --> 41:56.600
Listen, Gioconda, tell me honestly.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.480
Why do you want to come to Afghanistan?

41:58.480 --> 42:01.400
You could sit at the headquarters and draw.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.600
You won't understand

42:02.600 --> 42:04.320
So make it simple

42:04.320 --> 42:07.480
Simple?

42:07.480 --> 42:10.400
Do you see the tank?

42:10.400 --> 42:13.880
Beautiful, isn't it?
What a power!

42:13.880 --> 42:17.800
And hasn`t nothing superfluous,
not a line

42:20.800 --> 42:22.320
Weapons are even more beautiful!

42:22.320 --> 42:25.600
The most beautiful thing mankind created

42:25.600 --> 42:28.200
So?

42:28.200 --> 42:31.480
In the renaissance period
there was an artist named Michelangelo 

42:31.480 --> 42:34.880
One day, someone asked him 
how he creates his sculptures.

42:34.880 --> 42:38.600
He simply said, I just take a rock 
and get rid of the superfluous parts

42:38.600 --> 42:42.600
Do you understand? 
Beauty keeps only the essential

42:42.600 --> 42:46.520
Without anything superfluous.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.320
In war,
there is only life and death,

42:50.320 --> 42:54.240
nothing more

42:54.480 --> 42:56.800
War is beauty in itself.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.400
Listen, Gioconda, 
I don't understand you

42:58.400 --> 43:01.480
Are you a fool or what?

43:01.480 --> 43:02.400
What is so beautiful?

43:02.400 --> 43:05.880
When the guts are twisted 
under the tank tracks?

43:05.880 --> 43:08.800
You think it's a kids play?

43:08.800 --> 43:10.000
I said you wouldn`t understand

43:10.000 --> 43:13.920
Get lost, freak!

43:19.840 --> 43:22.480
Guys, letters!

43:22.480 --> 43:25.880
Calm down!

43:25.880 --> 43:28.880
- Stasenko!
- Here

43:28.880 --> 43:29.480
What day is today?

43:29.480 --> 43:33.400
Wednesday. Third!

43:33.800 --> 43:36.000
- Sparrow!
- Yes

43:36.000 --> 43:37.600
- Loutaïev
- Here

43:37.600 --> 43:38.720
- Suvorov
- Here!

43:38.720 --> 43:42.080
Riabokon

43:42.080 --> 43:43.600
That's it.

43:43.600 --> 43:47.520
That's it?

43:58.800 --> 44:00.480
My friends asked me whether I would
like to go out to a pub.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.800
But I will not go without you,
because I love you!

44:02.800 --> 44:03.880
Give it to me!

44:03.880 --> 44:08.800
But then I found two nice boys...

44:13.400 --> 44:17.320
You fucking got tough! 
Motherfucker!

44:18.880 --> 44:22.800
Come on! Come on!

44:25.320 --> 44:29.240
Come on, sparrow!

44:29.880 --> 44:31.480
Ah... 

44:31.480 --> 44:34.000
Attention, Soldiers!

44:34.000 --> 44:37.920
Stand at attention! You screwed Soldiers!

44:38.480 --> 44:42.400
You two come to see me later.

44:51.320 --> 44:53.400
Very good!

44:53.400 --> 44:55.320
Very good, man.

44:55.320 --> 44:58.400
Stand at attention!

44:58.400 --> 45:00.800
Turn back and march!

45:00.800 --> 45:02.480
March!

45:02.480 --> 45:05.000
Ok, guys. Listen carefully

45:05.000 --> 45:06.480
March steady. 

45:06.480 --> 45:07.720
Don't disperse until the top of that rock.

45:07.720 --> 45:10.080
Sparrow, Stas and Riaba, 
hold their legs and push them over.

45:10.080 --> 45:12.320
I don't give a fuck how, 
even bite 'em

45:12.320 --> 45:14.880
Pinochet, Chougoun, Gioconda,
you come with me.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.600
All come with me!

45:16.600 --> 45:20.400
March!

45:20.400 --> 45:24.320
Be steady! 

45:52.880 --> 45:56.800
Hooray!

46:10.480 --> 46:11.400
All squads stand up!

46:11.400 --> 46:14.320
Stand up, I said!

46:14.320 --> 46:16.320
Come out, lie down!

46:16.320 --> 46:19.000
All to the ground!

46:19.000 --> 46:21.600
Crawl! That´s an order!

46:21.600 --> 46:24.600
Crawl quickly! All! 
What?

46:24.600 --> 46:26.600
What did you say?
I didn´t understand!

46:26.600 --> 46:30.000
Stand up!

46:30.000 --> 46:31.400
Someone said something 
I didn`t understand.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.200
Who said it? 
Who?

46:33.200 --> 46:34.600
Who said it? 
I don´t know.

46:34.600 --> 46:37.320
Who?

46:37.320 --> 46:39.480
Was you?

46:39.480 --> 46:40.720
I don't know who said it.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.480
Who said it?

46:41.480 --> 46:42.400
I don't know.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.200
Come here, you!

46:44.200 --> 46:45.200
Do you want to tell me?

46:45.200 --> 46:48.320
Tell me. Tell me what you know.
Tell to my ears!

46:48.320 --> 46:49.720
Whisper it and I`ll forgive you!

46:49.720 --> 46:53.600
All of you!
Come on, I'm alone

46:53.600 --> 46:57.080
Come on, you and me,
nobody will know

46:57.080 --> 46:59.600
Do we have here normal people?

46:59.600 --> 47:03.520
Or just fucking freaks?

47:28.320 --> 47:31.080
Was it a bad dream or what?

47:31.080 --> 47:33.800
Maybe he dreamed something.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.880
Looks like he´s going nuts

47:35.880 --> 47:39.800
Wait! I heard that he again 
wrote a request to the headquarters.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.920
He wanted to go to Afghanistan with us.

47:47.600 --> 47:51.520
He was refused

48:06.200 --> 48:08.400
Hold on.
Who's there?

48:08.400 --> 48:11.000
What are you doing?
Stay where you are!

48:11.000 --> 48:14.920
Come on, quickly! Silent!

48:17.000 --> 48:20.480
Hold it.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.720
Is there any pot left?

48:23.720 --> 48:25.640
Quiet!

48:56.400 --> 48:58.480
Heh! She sings again!

48:58.480 --> 49:02.400
Did you hear it?
She comes like a machine gun

49:05.480 --> 49:09.400
Guys, Dygalo won't be looking for us?

49:10.720 --> 49:12.480
Nope!

49:12.480 --> 49:15.320
Why?

49:15.320 --> 49:19.240
Because...

49:22.880 --> 49:26.800
Ah Lutyi!
I thought I smelled something good!

49:27.800 --> 49:29.080
Something left?

49:29.080 --> 49:33.000
Take..

49:34.200 --> 49:41.120
I fucked so hard, 
that it won't rise for a whole year

49:41.320 --> 49:44.320
Guys, let's smoke another one?

49:44.320 --> 49:45.800
Ah, Sparrow, bird`s head!

49:45.800 --> 49:48.080
You know how we used to smoke
in the orphan house?

49:48.080 --> 49:50.720
Like Gypsies, one joint for all.
Wanna see?

49:50.720 --> 49:54.640
Show me.

49:56.800 --> 50:00.720
Look at what they`re doing!

50:10.320 --> 50:12.480
Hey, guys, you are so good,
I love you all

50:20.800 --> 50:24.320
Bird had enough! Don't give him more

50:24.320 --> 50:26.800
Otherwise we'll need to carry him again

50:26.800 --> 50:29.800
Ok

50:29.800 --> 50:33.720
I'm going

50:34.320 --> 50:38.240
Tell me, are you a man?

50:38.720 --> 50:42.720
No really, tell me,
are you a man or what?

50:42.720 --> 50:46.080
Stop it, Oleg

50:46.080 --> 50:47.200
What?

50:47.200 --> 50:48.800
I have a girl, Olga,
you know how she is.

50:48.800 --> 50:48.880
Ah, Olga

50:48.880 --> 50:52.800
So love your Olga.
Everyone has his Olga,

50:53.080 --> 50:57.000
We all have,
but do you remember what you were?

50:58.800 --> 51:02.720
Now you`ve became a real man,
and there's only a last test.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.600
You must go there, bird,
You must!

51:05.600 --> 51:07.320
It's not a resort we are going to

51:07.320 --> 51:09.080
maybe this is your last chance

51:09.080 --> 51:10.800
You can't go virgin to the war

51:10.800 --> 51:13.200
it's a men thing, understand?

51:13.200 --> 51:16.320
Come on, Sparrow, 
go for it, come on!

51:16.320 --> 51:18.800
Maybe she doesn`t want me

51:18.800 --> 51:22.800
Are you fool?!
She likes you the most

51:22.800 --> 51:24.080
Really? You kidding me

51:24.080 --> 51:26.320
I swear, ask the boys
I am not kidding

51:26.320 --> 51:29.800
C'mon c'mon, go!

51:29.800 --> 51:31.400
She has seen you many times at the camp

51:31.400 --> 51:34.320
But you paid no attention
and she felt hurt

51:34.320 --> 51:37.600
No, I can't do like this... 
before you all...

51:37.600 --> 51:41.520
Well, drink in the meantime,
I'll be back

51:44.880 --> 51:48.200
His he so special?

51:48.200 --> 51:49.600
- Better than others,
- I don't get it!

51:49.600 --> 51:51.600
Shut up!
I'll explain to you later

51:51.600 --> 51:55.200
You need help Sparrow? 
Want me to hold her legs?

51:55.200 --> 51:59.120
Sparrow, just go!

51:59.600 --> 52:03.000
Go fight! 
Take the sword out!

52:03.000 --> 52:06.800
If I don't come back

52:06.800 --> 52:09.800
You`ll write, he died bravely

52:09.800 --> 52:13.720
Soldiers, forward!

52:24.400 --> 52:27.400
Stas, what's the matter?

52:27.400 --> 52:29.720
Why are you sad?

52:29.720 --> 52:33.640
I miss my family.
Give me one

52:40.400 --> 52:44.320
It's a bit scary, isn't it guys?

52:45.800 --> 52:49.720
If you`re honest, 
without any bullshit.

52:50.880 --> 52:54.080
It´s scary.

52:54.080 --> 52:56.320
Not all die...

52:56.320 --> 53:00.240
If it happens fast,
it's not that scary

53:00.600 --> 53:03.720
The worst thing is if you get crippled

53:03.720 --> 53:07.640
When I was in Tachkent, I went to that hospital
and some Soldiers were there

53:07.800 --> 53:10.200
In a whole ward

53:10.200 --> 53:14.120
Each one occupying only half a bed...

53:22.080 --> 53:25.080
I knew a guy who came from the battlefield                       

53:25.080 --> 53:32.000
He was complete, 
but his belly was cut by a splinter.

53:32.200 --> 53:36.120
He got a pipe coming from his stomach,
and a bag tied to a leg.

53:45.360 --> 53:49.280
They call him bagpipes...

53:57.880 --> 54:01.800
What's up with Sparrow?
Is he sleeping or reading books?

54:03.600 --> 54:07.520
Wait, I'm going to see.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.480
You are bruts!
Understand, animals!

54:12.480 --> 54:16.400
You are like animals,
don't care with whom and where

54:16.400 --> 54:20.320
I can't do like this!
You all are animals!

54:24.600 --> 54:28.520
I thought that`ll make you some good...

54:50.000 --> 54:53.920
What are you looking at?

54:57.320 --> 55:01.240
Have anyone told you
that you are very beautiful?

55:03.480 --> 55:07.400
Are you in love with me?
So marry me and they`ll be invited.

55:14.720 --> 55:18.640
You must know it,
you are so beautiful

55:24.320 --> 55:28.080
Are you an idiot or what?

55:28.080 --> 55:32.000
I`m an artist

55:36.400 --> 55:40.320
Cyprida (Aphrodite)

55:45.080 --> 55:48.000
Aphrodite, coming from the sea

55:48.000 --> 55:51.920
Aphrodite!

55:52.320 --> 55:55.080
Goddess of beauty

55:55.080 --> 55:58.400
The sea washes away
all the sins

55:58.400 --> 56:00.880
Eternal purity

56:00.880 --> 56:02.480
Goddess

56:02.480 --> 56:05.880
Everyone worship her!

56:05.880 --> 56:09.800
On your knees!

56:27.200 --> 56:31.120
Guys, I love you!

56:43.480 --> 56:47.400
Rank

56:49.000 --> 56:52.920
- Comrade Lie... 
- At ease.

57:04.480 --> 57:08.400
We'll...

57:16.800 --> 57:20.720
Left

57:21.880 --> 57:25.800
Run to the plane, move!

59:25.880 --> 59:28.200
Krasnoyarsk?

59:28.200 --> 59:30.320
Is there someone from Krasnoyarsk?

59:30.320 --> 59:31.880
Krasnoyarsk?

59:31.880 --> 59:33.080
I am

59:33.080 --> 59:35.320
Where are you from?

59:35.320 --> 59:36.480
Kraza

59:36.480 --> 59:39.880
And I'm from Yershovka.
My countryman!

59:39.880 --> 59:42.080
Just stay cool

59:42.080 --> 59:43.320
Ok

59:43.320 --> 59:46.800
I got back and you'll come back too!

59:46.800 --> 59:49.080
Here, this is a amulet

59:49.080 --> 59:51.200
Take it

59:51.200 --> 59:55.120
4 over-periods, 28 missions,
and not a scratch

59:56.320 --> 59:59.400
Wear this and don't take it off,
do you understand?

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.720
Yes

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.640
Countryman, don't take it off

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.720
Then pass it to others when you come back. 
Just wear it

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.600
Aye

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.800
What's your name?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.000
Oleg, and you?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.920
Kolia

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.200
Look there, guys

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.120
Commander! On the right!

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.400
Where are the brakes?

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.720
Keep it steady!

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.520
Help us!

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.400
- Melkoumov
- Yes

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.320
- Sitroïlov
- Yes

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.320
- Riabokon
- Yes

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.200
- Vanifatiev
- Yes

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:40.880
- Demtchenko
- Yes

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.800
- Bekbulatov
- Yes

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.720
Go to the 4th company,
follow me

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.480
Bye, guys

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.720
Take care.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.640
So long, man, bye

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.480
For the junkies, alcoholics and sex maniacs,

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.600
the 9th company

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.520
Follow me

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.000
Oh, fresh meat is coming

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.400
Get hanged, ghosts

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.480
Attention!

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.400
Stand at attention!

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.720
Soldiers, congratulations! 
Welcome to the valiant 9th company!

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.200
I don't get it,
Soldiers

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.600
Welcome

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.720
To

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.600
The valiant 9th

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.880
Company

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.200
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.120
Fuck off Ukrainian.
Take them outside and wank them there.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.520
I am Lieutenant Pogrebniak.
Forget all you've known.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.400
Here you`re neither bad or good
Here, you're nothing

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.400
Yes, we've already heard it 
in some other place

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.320
I plan to deal with you day and night,
until you become real Soldiers

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.800
Is it clear?

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.720
Yes, Comrade Lieutenant

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.880
Huh?

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.800
Yes, Comrade Lieutenant

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.320
That's good.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.240
Private Tchougaïnov

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.320
Why is it so wear?

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.240
This machine gun was Samuilin`s.
He died like an hero.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.600
He killed 8 ghosts with it!

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.400
And got a medal

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.480
It's scratched a bit,
because he died of a grenade

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.400
It's not such a big deal.
Glue it.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.800
The barrel is skewed,
How am I gonna shoot?

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.800
You are very lucky, asshole

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.000
This gun is special

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You should feel proud,
instead of complaining

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.920
Comr...
Soldier! Sign here!

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.640
Turn left, march!

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.800
Who was your former officer?

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.720
1st Lieutenant Dygalo

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.640
Sashka...

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.240
I thought he retired.
He slept there

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:14.000
Screaming whole night long before
going to combat, no one could sleep anymore

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.000
Then I guess they took him to the hospital
at Tachkent.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.400
Aha

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.320
Was a good guy, joyful, 
used to laugh all the time.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.800
He had some illness.
Hey doc, how'd you call it?

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.400
It is called contusion

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.320
I thought you'd say something clever.
What a jerk!

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.480
Oh, shut up!

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.480
And White Snow, always there?

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.400
Yeah, always there.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.000
Say, painter

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.400
Is this good?

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.200
More or less.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.120
A guy made it by memory

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.600
Listen Ukrainian

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.520
Pomidor, that son of a bitch,
gave him the broken Samuilin`s gun

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.720
And the new one was probably sold out...

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.240
What? He trades weapons?

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.240
In war, some die
and some make profits of it

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:21.240
Comrade Lieutenant, I heard that we'll go to combat 
in two or three days, is that right?

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:25.640
Not a combat, but we go out.
Our mission is to occupy a height

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.640
Hold the line of defence,
protecting our convoys

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:36.399
Is that all?

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:40.319
Yes, you thought that it was Stalingrad here?

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:35.319
What a monument,
like a bronze statue.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.600
Kagraman

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.800
What?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.880
Kag-ra-man

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.399
Douchmans call him so

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.800
It means angry giant

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.600
Our commander is the only one,
in the whole Afghanistan,

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.479
who`s been nominated for hero three times

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.720
But each time he returns from combat,
he beats shit out of some brass hat

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.640
They don't take him to the martial court, 
though

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.320
But he ain't getting his star.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.880
Afanasui, who are them?

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.600
They are the green

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.000
The Afghanistani army,
our Allies

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.920
There is nothing worse
than working with them

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.640
When it gets tough a little, they run

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.880
While you think they cover your flank,
they're far behind

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.720
Three kilometers away

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.000
Once we got surrounded because of these assholes.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Where begins the Douchmans`s territory?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.480
After the block station

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.000
There they are

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.480
They say: 
Russians are our friends and brothers

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.400
But when the night falls, 
they dig out their guns

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.000
And cried Allah Akbar and other shit

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.400
So do not be in a hury to join this war, guys.
You'll get it anyway.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.880
You probably already made a bet 
who kills a ghost first.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.880
Of course

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.080
Bet on what?

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.720
A Marlboro pack

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.880
I add another one

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.880
And on your premise who was the first, 
Comrade Lieutenant?

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.800
Samuilin, 
he killed the first ghost

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.720
He also left first, in the zinc box,
what remained of him, the pieces we could gather

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.800
There they are, the savages

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.800
The frontier guard

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.720
We'll drop some ammo and food 
and go on

01:11:34.305 --> 01:11:40.521
