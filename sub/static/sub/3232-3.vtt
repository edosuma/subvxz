00:12.267 --> 00:14.228
Okay. That's okay.

00:27.282 --> 00:28.825
Get that.

00:30.786 --> 00:32.371
Hey.

01:45.110 --> 01:48.530
Oh, God. Please.
-Oh, jeez.

01:48.739 --> 01:50.157
Please.

01:50.365 --> 01:51.658
Please.

01:58.999 --> 02:01.835
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

02:02.044 --> 02:03.837
You sure this is the way to go?

02:05.047 --> 02:06.298
Yeah.

02:06.507 --> 02:07.841
Yeah.

03:30.841 --> 03:31.925
You see that?

04:02.414 --> 04:05.083
What does he remember?
-Not a whole lot.

04:05.292 --> 04:07.127
He came in dehydrated
and disoriented...

04:07.336 --> 04:10.047
...but once we gave him fluids
he stabilised pretty quickly.

04:10.255 --> 04:11.381
But I mean...

04:11.590 --> 04:14.968
He knows where he is?
-Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

04:15.177 --> 04:18.514
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

04:18.721 --> 04:21.308
Go on in. He's probably awake.

04:27.564 --> 04:28.982
My God.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.235
Walter.

04:33.362 --> 04:35.072
I'm so sorry.

04:42.788 --> 04:43.997
Come here.

04:44.206 --> 04:46.500
You know who I am, right?

04:47.292 --> 04:48.835
Yes, son. I know who you are.

04:49.044 --> 04:51.880
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

04:56.718 --> 04:58.011
It's so good to see you.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.099
How do you feel?

05:06.562 --> 05:07.813
Better.

05:08.021 --> 05:09.857
Yeah. I...

05:10.065 --> 05:12.317
I feel like myself.

05:12.526 --> 05:14.528
Really, I mean, in...

05:16.154 --> 05:19.825
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that...

05:20.033 --> 05:21.076
...I feel fine.

05:21.285 --> 05:23.287
My God, Walt.

05:25.706 --> 05:27.875
What a day this has been.

05:28.083 --> 05:31.211
So, Uncle Hank,
he was in a shootout?

05:32.212 --> 05:33.547
A shootout?

05:33.755 --> 05:36.717
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

05:36.925 --> 05:37.926
Uncle Hank wasted him.

05:38.135 --> 05:40.804
Oh, my God. Is he all right?
-Absolutely fine.

05:41.013 --> 05:44.808
Where did this happen? How could-?
-Walt, everything's okay.

05:46.143 --> 05:48.437
We're all okay.

05:49.313 --> 05:50.314
We'll be all right.

05:50.522 --> 05:53.150
<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>

05:53.358 --> 05:54.568
No.

05:54.776 --> 05:57.738
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

05:57.946 --> 06:01.909
<i>But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?</i>

06:02.618 --> 06:04.244
I really...

06:05.954 --> 06:08.999
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

06:09.208 --> 06:10.709
Well, which supermarket?

06:10.918 --> 06:13.962
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

06:14.171 --> 06:16.882
<i>-Marie.
-I... Don't get me wrong.</i>

06:17.090 --> 06:22.095
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

06:22.304 --> 06:24.097
I just, I mean...

06:25.766 --> 06:27.935
He... Naked?

06:28.143 --> 06:30.938
He was naked.

06:31.146 --> 06:32.898
Naked.

06:33.106 --> 06:34.691
In a supermarket.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.276
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

06:37.319 --> 06:39.821
<i>In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

06:40.030 --> 06:43.075
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

06:43.283 --> 06:44.701
How's Hank?

06:44.910 --> 06:47.454
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of...

06:47.663 --> 06:50.958
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

06:51.166 --> 06:54.002
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

06:54.211 --> 06:57.339
...they'd let him go home on time.

06:58.674 --> 07:00.759
But how is he? Really?

07:03.178 --> 07:04.471
Hank?

07:07.224 --> 07:09.852
He's indestructible, you know that.

07:10.853 --> 07:15.440
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

07:15.649 --> 07:18.318
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

07:18.527 --> 07:21.822
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

07:22.030 --> 07:25.617
He was shot previous to your arrival?
-Yes, sir.

07:25.826 --> 07:29.454
Again I instructed him
to show his hands.

07:29.663 --> 07:31.832
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle...

07:32.040 --> 07:35.586
...and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

07:35.794 --> 07:37.838
I returned fire and sought cover...

07:38.046 --> 07:41.091
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

07:42.426 --> 07:44.970
When he paused to reload...

07:45.470 --> 07:47.556
...I was able to take
an effective shot.

07:49.808 --> 07:51.143
Agent Schrader...

07:51.351 --> 07:54.771
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

07:54.980 --> 07:57.691
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.485
I was tending to another matter.
-What other matter?

08:04.907 --> 08:06.617
An unrelated family matter.

08:07.075 --> 08:09.870
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

08:10.662 --> 08:13.582
Your brother-in-law?
-Yes, sir. He's since been found.

08:13.790 --> 08:16.543
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

08:16.752 --> 08:18.670
At the time, he'd been missing
for hours...

08:18.879 --> 08:22.382
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

08:22.591 --> 08:24.510
I was talking to his acquaintances...

08:24.718 --> 08:26.970
...trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

08:27.179 --> 08:30.766
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

08:30.974 --> 08:34.102
...a Jesse Pinkman.

08:34.311 --> 08:38.899
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

08:39.107 --> 08:42.361
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

08:42.568 --> 08:46.281
Have you run him down yet?
-Not yet, but we're working on it.

08:58.001 --> 09:00.587
Man, they're like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

09:00.796 --> 09:02.214
They don't give up.

09:03.382 --> 09:05.676
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

09:05.884 --> 09:09.179
They need probable cause.
-Probable cause?

09:09.388 --> 09:11.181
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

09:11.390 --> 09:14.768
I told you, this is serious shit.

09:15.143 --> 09:17.020
I'm like an outlaw.

09:17.229 --> 09:18.397
Okay.

09:27.656 --> 09:29.366
Let's do this.

09:41.295 --> 09:42.796
Holy Christ!

09:44.298 --> 09:45.465
You're Willy Wonka.

09:45.674 --> 09:48.427
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

09:50.220 --> 09:51.722
Put me on your magical boat, man.

09:51.930 --> 09:55.058
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

09:55.267 --> 09:56.602
So where you keep the pseudo?

09:56.810 --> 10:00.564
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

10:00.772 --> 10:04.443
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

10:04.651 --> 10:06.403
No pseudo?

10:06.862 --> 10:10.824
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

10:12.034 --> 10:14.745
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

10:16.163 --> 10:18.665
But I can't just let you
break this down.

10:18.874 --> 10:21.502
That'd be sacrilege.
-I told you, that's why we're here.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.337
You saw the cops. Right?
-Sure.

10:23.545 --> 10:25.881
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

10:26.089 --> 10:28.842
You know, for the road?
-No, forget it, all right?

10:29.051 --> 10:32.888
This stuff has to go, like, now.
-Dude, you owe me.

10:34.598 --> 10:37.768
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

10:37.976 --> 10:39.561
God, Badger!

10:40.979 --> 10:44.399
Don't mess with me.

10:44.983 --> 10:47.027
Got it?

10:49.905 --> 10:52.658
Yeah, I got it.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.969
Oh, my God.

11:16.306 --> 11:17.558
Okay, that's all of it.

11:18.892 --> 11:20.435
This was a bad choice.

11:25.816 --> 11:27.609
You sure about this guy?

11:27.818 --> 11:29.987
He's totally, totally cool.

11:30.195 --> 11:31.947
He's my cousin.

11:35.742 --> 11:39.580
Yo, what'd we say, 500?
-We didn't say, and it's 1000.

11:39.788 --> 11:41.164
Thousand bucks?

11:41.373 --> 11:44.042
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

11:44.418 --> 11:46.044
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

11:49.131 --> 11:50.924
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

11:55.721 --> 11:57.014
...560.

11:57.890 --> 11:59.308
You know what?
-Hey-No-

11:59.516 --> 12:02.394
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

12:02.603 --> 12:06.106
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

12:06.315 --> 12:10.485
That right? You a stand-up dude?
-Yeah, I am.

12:10.694 --> 12:12.905
I will get you the other 500.

12:13.113 --> 12:14.281
Five hundred more.

12:15.657 --> 12:17.743
Your word's your bond, right?

12:18.410 --> 12:19.786
Right.

12:25.626 --> 12:30.047
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

12:30.672 --> 12:33.300
What are you doing now, exactly?

12:33.675 --> 12:35.385
I'm giving you, like, two hours...

12:35.594 --> 12:39.056
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

12:39.264 --> 12:40.807
You're not using your own name.

12:41.016 --> 12:45.812
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

12:46.021 --> 12:48.065
Why do you gotta go and do this?

12:48.690 --> 12:50.943
They need probable cause.

12:51.151 --> 12:52.486
I'm giving it to them.

13:05.457 --> 13:07.751
What's the last thing
you remember?

13:08.877 --> 13:12.506
Well, I was driving home.

13:13.048 --> 13:14.341
I think.

13:15.801 --> 13:16.969
And...

13:17.886 --> 13:19.429
Do you remember coming home?

13:20.389 --> 13:22.766
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

13:25.811 --> 13:29.523
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

13:30.399 --> 13:32.150
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

13:32.359 --> 13:37.698
Nothing else? No fleeting images?
-Well, no. I...

13:39.032 --> 13:40.242
I was-

13:40.450 --> 13:47.040
I was walking down some road
or highway...

13:47.958 --> 13:50.419
...with a lot of headlights...

13:50.627 --> 13:54.756
...and I remember feeling fear.

13:57.509 --> 13:59.011
That's it.
-All right. Thank you.

13:59.219 --> 14:02.222
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

14:02.431 --> 14:04.933
The MRI shows no metastases.

14:05.142 --> 14:08.020
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

14:08.228 --> 14:10.063
Yeah, we're looking really good.

14:10.272 --> 14:12.024
Oh, thank God.

14:13.734 --> 14:15.944
So, what was it, then?

14:16.153 --> 14:19.531
There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
-And considering your condition...

14:19.740 --> 14:21.408
...the blood panel looks good.

14:21.783 --> 14:24.745
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

14:25.120 --> 14:28.207
As of right now, we really...

14:28.415 --> 14:29.791
...can't say.

14:30.709 --> 14:33.420
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field...

14:33.629 --> 14:36.256
...but isn't it possible
that this had something to do...

14:36.465 --> 14:38.592
...with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

14:38.800 --> 14:40.344
There's the antiemetic...

14:40.552 --> 14:42.387
...the antitussive...

14:42.596 --> 14:46.099
...the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

14:48.268 --> 14:52.648
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say...

14:52.856 --> 14:54.733
...I'm feeling much better.

14:54.942 --> 14:57.528
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications...

14:57.736 --> 15:00.239
...the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

15:00.447 --> 15:04.451
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

15:04.660 --> 15:07.871
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

15:08.080 --> 15:11.792
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.878
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

15:15.671 --> 15:17.089
Stressed out? I-

15:17.297 --> 15:19.299
No, I don't think I'm-
-Walt, please.

15:19.508 --> 15:21.802
Stressed out is putting it...

15:22.010 --> 15:23.262
...mildly.

15:25.472 --> 15:31.061
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said...

15:31.270 --> 15:32.938
...I'm feeling much better.

15:33.146 --> 15:35.816
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

15:36.024 --> 15:38.944
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.697
A ways down the road?

15:41.905 --> 15:46.076
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

15:48.161 --> 15:51.498
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

15:51.707 --> 15:54.042
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

15:54.459 --> 15:56.503
But until we know
what caused this incident...

15:56.712 --> 15:59.089
...we can't be certain it won't recur.

16:42.841 --> 16:46.053
That your last hit?
-Yeah.

16:46.261 --> 16:48.555
Finish it quick.

17:21.463 --> 17:23.382
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

17:23.589 --> 17:27.594
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

17:33.767 --> 17:35.644
I'm going, I'm going.

17:36.311 --> 17:37.646
What's going on?

17:37.855 --> 17:39.857
What did I do?

17:43.151 --> 17:44.778
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

18:05.465 --> 18:08.135
What, man?
-Tell me again.

18:09.344 --> 18:10.429
Again?

18:10.637 --> 18:13.473
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

18:13.682 --> 18:16.643
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

18:16.852 --> 18:20.189
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

18:20.397 --> 18:21.773
Taco? I don't know any Taco...

18:21.982 --> 18:24.568
...and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

18:24.776 --> 18:26.403
Three days,
you must have got hungry.

18:26.612 --> 18:27.863
Yeah, I guess.

18:28.071 --> 18:30.365
You order take-out?
-Yeah.

18:30.574 --> 18:32.576
Yeah, where from?

18:33.035 --> 18:35.412
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan...

18:35.621 --> 18:37.748
...from that chink place
around the corner?

18:37.956 --> 18:41.668
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

18:41.877 --> 18:43.504
You know, Funyuns.

18:43.712 --> 18:45.172
I had a Hot Pocket.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.883
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

18:48.091 --> 18:49.718
You didn't notice your car
was gone?

18:49.927 --> 18:52.471
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

18:52.679 --> 18:54.765
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

18:54.973 --> 18:57.017
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

18:57.226 --> 19:00.187
You weren't answering your phone.
-It was in my car.

19:01.522 --> 19:03.190
That right?
-Yeah.

19:04.942 --> 19:07.236
We found your car...

19:07.444 --> 19:09.571
...but your phone wasn't in it.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.281
You found my car?

19:12.115 --> 19:13.534
You found my car?

19:13.742 --> 19:17.079
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

19:20.290 --> 19:22.876
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

19:23.085 --> 19:25.712
Did you leave anything else
in the car?

19:25.921 --> 19:27.047
Like what?

19:28.882 --> 19:30.676
Like what? Like...

19:30.884 --> 19:33.220
I don't know. Like this?

19:41.103 --> 19:46.567
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

19:46.775 --> 19:48.402
That's not mine.

19:48.610 --> 19:50.404
That's not yours?

19:50.946 --> 19:53.407
He says it's not his, Gomie.

19:53.615 --> 19:55.951
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

19:56.159 --> 19:59.746
I wish.
-Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

19:59.955 --> 20:02.040
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't you?

20:02.249 --> 20:05.127
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

20:05.419 --> 20:07.838
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

20:08.046 --> 20:09.715
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

20:09.923 --> 20:12.342
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

20:13.677 --> 20:15.888
So who's your chief, little Injun?

20:16.096 --> 20:17.598
What?

20:17.806 --> 20:20.809
What does that even mean?
-I think your story's bullshit.

20:21.018 --> 20:23.478
I think you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

20:23.687 --> 20:25.606
Your car was there
because you were there.

20:26.148 --> 20:30.110
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

20:31.153 --> 20:33.197
So, what are you saying?

20:33.405 --> 20:35.324
I shot someone?

20:35.532 --> 20:38.994
With, like, a gun?
-You?

20:39.661 --> 20:41.079
No.

20:41.288 --> 20:44.374
Only shooting you do
is into a Kleenex.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.711
But I think you know
the badass who did.

20:48.962 --> 20:53.383
Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

20:54.218 --> 20:56.845
Funyuns and boom-boom.

20:57.596 --> 20:59.097
No.

20:59.306 --> 21:01.141
I don't think so.

21:02.559 --> 21:04.478
Tell you what. We're gonna...

21:04.686 --> 21:08.690
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

21:08.899 --> 21:10.567
And you know what?

21:12.736 --> 21:16.615
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

21:20.244 --> 21:22.120
Don't go nowhere.

21:35.926 --> 21:39.930
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

21:40.138 --> 21:43.183
I got medical issues.
-Medical issues?

21:43.392 --> 21:45.352
Like, what kind of medical issues?

21:45.561 --> 21:47.229
You got penis withdrawal?

21:47.437 --> 21:49.773
You got schlongus interruptus?

21:50.732 --> 21:53.026
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...

21:53.235 --> 21:55.070
...and you get a root beer
and a tinkle.

21:55.279 --> 21:57.239
Tell me the last three days.
-I told you...

21:57.447 --> 21:59.992
...we were shacked up
since Saturday.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.412
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

22:04.204 --> 22:07.124
Not even for a second?

22:08.834 --> 22:11.461
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.422
Maybe?

22:13.630 --> 22:15.382
Did Jesse leave the room?

22:16.550 --> 22:18.302
He did, didn't he?

22:19.011 --> 22:21.889
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

22:22.681 --> 22:25.350
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

22:25.851 --> 22:29.188
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

22:30.898 --> 22:33.358
It's you. I know you.

22:33.567 --> 22:36.904
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

22:37.112 --> 22:38.864
What?
-The kid with the crutches.

22:39.072 --> 22:41.366
The football player.
-How about we stay on topic?

22:41.575 --> 22:45.662
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

22:45.871 --> 22:48.665
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

22:48.874 --> 22:50.584
And that's all I'm saying about that.

22:51.251 --> 22:52.377
Now, come on.

22:52.586 --> 22:54.755
Where's my root beer?

22:58.133 --> 23:00.385
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

23:00.594 --> 23:02.095
It's a long story, Gomie.

23:02.304 --> 23:05.807
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

23:06.016 --> 23:09.186
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

23:16.318 --> 23:18.487
And how are you sleeping?

23:21.990 --> 23:24.368
Fine. Most nights.

23:24.868 --> 23:25.869
Good.

23:26.078 --> 23:28.455
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images...

23:28.664 --> 23:30.791
...things you can't
get out of your head?

23:36.046 --> 23:38.465
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

23:38.674 --> 23:42.469
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

23:42.845 --> 23:45.639
...but where is this going, exactly?

23:45.848 --> 23:49.226
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

23:49.434 --> 23:53.146
Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
-Ongoing for how long?

23:53.355 --> 23:54.648
I just met you. Hard to say.

23:54.857 --> 23:57.860
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

23:59.528 --> 24:03.156
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

24:03.365 --> 24:04.658
Now...

24:04.867 --> 24:10.164
...if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

24:10.873 --> 24:13.000
Walt...

24:13.208 --> 24:16.753
...a fugue state
is a very serious event.

24:16.962 --> 24:19.089
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

24:19.298 --> 24:20.382
Get into a situation...

24:20.591 --> 24:22.509
...where you could be shot
by the police?

24:22.718 --> 24:24.386
We can't allow you to leave...

24:24.595 --> 24:27.681
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

24:27.890 --> 24:30.642
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

24:36.690 --> 24:39.484
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

24:39.693 --> 24:40.861
It's very straightforward.

24:41.069 --> 24:44.448
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

24:44.656 --> 24:45.949
What about my family?

24:46.158 --> 24:49.494
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

24:49.703 --> 24:52.331
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

24:52.539 --> 24:56.210
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

24:57.961 --> 25:00.047
And you, as a medical practitioner...

25:00.255 --> 25:02.424
...you abide
by these strictures absolutely.

25:02.633 --> 25:03.967
Yes.

25:10.265 --> 25:11.433
All right.

25:14.269 --> 25:16.188
There was no fugue state.

25:18.106 --> 25:20.108
I remember everything.

25:24.738 --> 25:26.782
The truth is...

25:26.990 --> 25:30.619
...I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

25:30.827 --> 25:34.248
I just had to get out...

25:34.957 --> 25:36.124
...and so I left.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.502
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

25:38.710 --> 25:45.092
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

25:45.968 --> 25:48.762
I got as far as Gallup...

25:52.224 --> 25:55.310
...and then it was just time
to come home.

25:55.519 --> 25:57.104
So...

25:57.312 --> 26:00.148
...being found naked
in a supermarket...

26:00.357 --> 26:03.902
...that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

26:04.111 --> 26:07.322
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

26:14.997 --> 26:16.707
Why run away?

26:16.915 --> 26:19.960
What did you feel
you had to run from?

26:26.091 --> 26:28.093
Doctor, my wife
is seven months pregnant...

26:28.302 --> 26:30.304
...with a baby we didn't intend.

26:31.346 --> 26:34.975
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

26:35.184 --> 26:39.521
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

26:39.730 --> 26:44.526
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

26:44.735 --> 26:46.778
I have watched
all of my colleagues...

26:46.987 --> 26:49.364
...and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable...

26:49.573 --> 26:53.452
...and within 18 months,
I will be dead.

26:55.579 --> 26:58.081
And you ask why I ran?

27:32.157 --> 27:33.742
Gomie, you wanna do the honours?

27:43.293 --> 27:45.003
What's that mean?
-That means yes.

27:45.212 --> 27:49.216
Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
-Come on, this is bullshit.

27:49.424 --> 27:53.053
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

27:53.262 --> 27:54.721
Señor...

27:55.347 --> 27:57.057
...are we on the planet Mars?

28:00.978 --> 28:02.729
Are we on the planet Saturn?

28:05.148 --> 28:06.775
Are we on the planet Earth?

28:09.444 --> 28:12.573
Señor, is today Friday?

28:13.031 --> 28:14.408
Is today Monday?

28:15.576 --> 28:17.161
Is today Tuesday?

28:17.911 --> 28:20.497
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

28:22.666 --> 28:23.834
Señor...

28:25.419 --> 28:28.255
...was this man
at your house yesterday?

28:35.762 --> 28:40.350
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

28:48.192 --> 28:51.111
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

28:51.320 --> 28:53.572
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

28:55.449 --> 28:59.453
Señor, are you scared of this man?

29:00.996 --> 29:03.457
No, he's not scared.

29:07.169 --> 29:09.421
Come on, Granddad.

29:09.630 --> 29:11.882
Don't you wanna help us out?

29:29.191 --> 29:31.318
Oh, man.

29:38.784 --> 29:40.327
I guess that's a no.

29:42.704 --> 29:45.332
I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

29:45.541 --> 29:47.668
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

29:47.876 --> 29:50.921
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

29:51.129 --> 29:55.175
All right. It was worth a try at least.
-We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

29:55.384 --> 29:57.302
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

29:57.511 --> 29:59.596
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

29:59.805 --> 30:03.100
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do...

30:03.308 --> 30:05.394
...with shooting Tuco, man.

30:07.229 --> 30:09.857
Dad? Hey, Dad.

30:10.065 --> 30:11.859
Hey, can you hear me?

30:12.860 --> 30:15.737
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

30:17.239 --> 30:18.240
What's-?

30:18.448 --> 30:21.410
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

30:21.618 --> 30:23.370
You know, I actually...

30:23.579 --> 30:26.331
...lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

30:26.540 --> 30:27.749
I've been busy as...

30:27.958 --> 30:29.835
As totally productive.

30:30.043 --> 30:33.338
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

30:33.547 --> 30:36.842
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

30:37.050 --> 30:39.511
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.055
Hey, could you give me a ride?

30:42.264 --> 30:46.685
I'm actually-
I'm downtown and my car's in the...

30:49.563 --> 30:51.481
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will-

30:51.690 --> 30:55.402
I'll call you later
when you have some...

30:56.236 --> 30:58.155
Okay. Yeah. No. I-

30:58.363 --> 31:00.991
I get it. I get it.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.577
Okay, bye.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.880
Thanks.

31:15.088 --> 31:17.841
So, what are you doing now?

31:18.050 --> 31:20.010
Waffle House?

31:22.137 --> 31:23.430
Waffle House is good.

31:58.131 --> 31:59.132
Pay phone?

31:59.341 --> 32:02.010
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

32:02.219 --> 32:03.220
So how did it go?

32:05.180 --> 32:06.640
Okay. You?

32:06.849 --> 32:11.144
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

32:11.478 --> 32:13.689
So you getting out of there?
-Tomorrow.

32:13.897 --> 32:15.899
So who came for you?

32:16.108 --> 32:17.860
The DEA? What did they ask you?

32:18.068 --> 32:21.530
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law...

32:21.738 --> 32:23.282
...took my rainy-day fund.

32:23.490 --> 32:25.284
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>

32:25.492 --> 32:28.745
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

32:28.954 --> 32:30.873
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

32:31.081 --> 32:33.000
Now I got like 80 bucks
to my name.

32:33.208 --> 32:34.585
Wait, wait. What does he know?

32:34.793 --> 32:36.378
Does he know it's your money?

32:36.587 --> 32:39.089
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

32:39.298 --> 32:40.841
The plan worked.

32:41.049 --> 32:42.259
They bought it.

32:42.467 --> 32:44.928
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

32:45.137 --> 32:49.266
<i>-Did he mention my name?
-No. Thanks for caring.</i>

32:51.643 --> 32:54.354
What about the basement?
-It's clean.

32:54.563 --> 32:56.523
<i>And the RV?</i>

32:56.732 --> 33:00.569
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

33:00.777 --> 33:03.113
Can he get it running again?

33:04.364 --> 33:06.950
<i>-Why?
-So we can cook.</i>

33:08.160 --> 33:09.912
So you still wanna cook?

33:10.120 --> 33:11.580
Seriously?

33:13.290 --> 33:15.542
What's changed, Jesse?

33:24.843 --> 33:27.554
Seven-hundred
thirty-seven thousand.

33:27.763 --> 33:29.723
Twenty-one pounds...

33:29.932 --> 33:32.267
...minus cash on hand...

33:33.101 --> 33:34.228
Cash on hand.

36:09.925 --> 36:14.388
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
-No, I was awake.

36:15.389 --> 36:19.726
Want some cornflakes?
-Yeah, sure.

36:25.774 --> 36:28.151
You okay?
-Yeah.

38:29.731 --> 38:31.733
Southwest Aniline again?

38:33.193 --> 38:34.194
What's this?

38:34.403 --> 38:36.738
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

38:36.947 --> 38:40.409
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

38:40.617 --> 38:42.953
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

38:43.579 --> 38:45.497
P2P, huh?

38:45.706 --> 38:47.249
So, what are you thinking?

38:47.457 --> 38:49.334
The two stooges over here
cooked it?

38:50.169 --> 38:53.505
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

38:53.714 --> 38:55.215
At least since this.

38:55.716 --> 38:58.051
Krazy-8.
-Yeah.

38:59.344 --> 39:02.264
Krazy-8, Tuco...

39:02.931 --> 39:06.185
Somehow, some way,
it's all connected.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.229
A simple explanation...

39:09.438 --> 39:11.982
...only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

39:12.191 --> 39:14.735
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

39:14.943 --> 39:17.237
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

39:17.779 --> 39:19.364
It's 11 in the morning.

39:19.573 --> 39:20.574
I'm buying.

39:20.782 --> 39:22.034
You're buying? Holy crap.

39:22.242 --> 39:25.078
What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
-Oh, yeah.

39:28.457 --> 39:30.918
Surprise.

39:31.627 --> 39:34.838
You little sneaky bastard, you.

39:35.422 --> 39:36.673
Very nice work.

39:37.674 --> 39:38.926
Thank you, sir.

39:41.094 --> 39:43.514
What's this?
-Look what we got you.

39:44.473 --> 39:46.850
Look at that, I love it.
-They got the gut right.

39:47.059 --> 39:49.102
Hey.
-There you go.

39:49.311 --> 39:50.938
Hey, thanks, man.
-Thank you.

39:53.148 --> 39:56.944
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

39:57.152 --> 39:59.112
You shouldn't have.

39:59.947 --> 40:03.450
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

40:03.659 --> 40:05.369
I love it.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.459
You going to finish
your apple juice?

40:13.836 --> 40:15.462
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

40:17.297 --> 40:19.049
You're supposed to drink it.

40:19.258 --> 40:22.678
The nurse said
you have to stay hydrated.

40:23.303 --> 40:24.930
But I'm not thirsty.

40:25.138 --> 40:28.392
Dad. Drink it.

40:38.318 --> 40:41.321
Hey.

40:41.530 --> 40:43.282
Better late than never, huh?

40:43.490 --> 40:45.409
Hey.
-Hey.

40:46.535 --> 40:48.245
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

40:48.453 --> 40:50.497
I see
the mark of the beast there, huh?

40:50.706 --> 40:52.875
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.961
They really cheer the place up.

40:57.546 --> 41:00.174
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

41:00.382 --> 41:03.844
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

41:04.344 --> 41:07.139
So tell us about the shootout.

41:07.347 --> 41:10.684
I was, you know, just doing my job.

41:10.893 --> 41:13.353
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

41:13.562 --> 41:15.480
Say, Walt, you know...

41:15.689 --> 41:18.400
...how are you?

41:19.109 --> 41:20.360
I'm okay.

41:20.569 --> 41:23.155
Really, I'm feeling fine.

41:23.489 --> 41:25.657
Yeah?
-Yeah. Yeah.

41:25.866 --> 41:28.702
The doctor is calling it a...

41:28.911 --> 41:32.956
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

41:33.165 --> 41:34.708
Damn.

41:34.917 --> 41:36.543
Which means non-recurring.

41:36.752 --> 41:38.921
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

41:39.129 --> 41:40.547
Sounds real good.

41:40.756 --> 41:44.384
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

41:44.593 --> 41:47.429
Listen, Hank.

41:48.388 --> 41:49.973
I don't know what to say. I mean...

41:50.182 --> 41:56.104
...you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so...

41:56.313 --> 41:59.983
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

42:00.192 --> 42:02.778
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

42:02.986 --> 42:06.406
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

42:06.615 --> 42:09.910
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake...

42:10.118 --> 42:12.120
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?

42:12.329 --> 42:15.499
You ought to disappear more often.

42:15.707 --> 42:18.085
Just kidding. Don't do that.

42:18.836 --> 42:20.963
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

42:21.171 --> 42:22.756
Look what they gave me.

42:22.965 --> 42:24.216
What is it?

42:24.424 --> 42:28.887
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

42:29.930 --> 42:31.306
His grill?
-Yeah.

42:31.515 --> 42:34.101
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

42:34.309 --> 42:36.603
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

42:36.812 --> 42:39.439
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

42:39.648 --> 42:41.441
Wow, cool.

42:41.650 --> 42:42.651
Yeah.

43:08.677 --> 43:11.430
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

43:18.687 --> 43:20.564
I'll get these in the wash.

43:20.772 --> 43:22.107
Okay.

43:58.727 --> 44:00.896
Say, honey, I...

44:01.104 --> 44:06.068
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

44:12.074 --> 44:15.786
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

44:27.714 --> 44:29.967
Skyler, listen to me.

44:32.594 --> 44:35.556
This will not happen again, okay?

44:35.764 --> 44:36.890
I won't let it.

44:38.100 --> 44:40.602
I'm still here. I'm me...

44:41.728 --> 44:44.189
...and we're gonna be okay.

44:50.112 --> 44:51.780
Walt...

44:54.741 --> 44:56.618
...do you have a second cell phone?

44:59.955 --> 45:01.456
A second cell phone?

45:01.665 --> 45:05.878
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath...

45:06.086 --> 45:08.172
...and you were very upset.

45:09.006 --> 45:11.925
It was like something
terrible had happened.

45:12.134 --> 45:14.970
And then your cell phone rang.

45:15.179 --> 45:18.432
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

45:18.640 --> 45:21.101
...and just disappeared.

45:22.853 --> 45:24.313
Yeah.

45:24.521 --> 45:26.815
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

45:27.024 --> 45:30.027
...there was no call.

45:30.485 --> 45:33.947
No call on the phone I know about.

45:38.827 --> 45:40.454
That is...

45:40.662 --> 45:42.372
...odd.

45:43.123 --> 45:45.542
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

45:45.751 --> 45:50.714
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

45:53.467 --> 45:55.010
Okay.
