why are you being so stubborn about this
I'm not being stubborn and all I just

13:51.288 --> 13:54.678
can't understand why you can't let go of
this because the other people's

13:54.678 --> 14:00.019
community won't take a nap reviews on
friendship or business or whatever

14:00.649 --> 14:05.479
I care Lee you handle the center's
business

14:05.479 --> 14:08.479
I don't need your opinion on the rest of
my life ok

14:12.419 --> 14:15.778

distance swimming must be really hard to

14:39.539 --> 14:41.458
work with the money gets home

14:41.458 --> 14:46.768
sure every time I feel like I've made a
breakthrough with that man invents a

14:46.769 --> 14:48.120
brand new square one

14:48.120 --> 14:51.600
well he's got a lot more walls and
you've got breakthroughs honey

14:51.600 --> 14:58.800
tell me something your frustration is
about your business your professional

14:58.799 --> 15:00.179
relationship right

15:00.179 --> 15:05.129
yeah of course right I'm not into him or
anything like that

15:05.970 --> 15:09.200
sometimes I don't even like right now

15:09.200 --> 15:13.520
of course there's one problem just now
you told him how much you cared about

15:13.519 --> 15:15.199
the center

15:15.200 --> 15:18.890
it came out wrong that's all what
difference does it make to you

15:19.610 --> 15:23.029
I know what it's like that Sean's hot
and cold

15:23.570 --> 15:28.190
I hate to see him hurt you like you hurt
me I don't see how that happened

15:28.190 --> 15:32.390
obviously he doesn't let anybody close
can think about anybody but his family

15:32.389 --> 15:34.759
the guilt keeps him from being with
other women

15:34.759 --> 15:43.039
yeah yeah well he was with me many many
nights and honestly it was great

15:46.620 --> 15:49.799
until he walked out on me like it was
nothing at all

15:49.799 --> 15:52.799
hate to see that happen to you leave

15:53.690 --> 15:56.780
I think I'd rather finish up the boat
myself okay Jenna

15:57.769 --> 16:00.769
whatever you say

16:11.129 --> 16:14.129
I cannot believe you actually got us
into Hollywood jobs

16:15.629 --> 16:20.970
I never thought dinner was actually
worth an arm and a leg man this is

16:20.970 --> 16:24.420
intense

16:24.419 --> 16:30.149
it makes me happy to see someone so and
through have one that if nothing else

16:31.350 --> 16:34.350
so I'm think you're gonna win this big
volleyball tournament

16:35.460 --> 16:38.879

world with this one

16:38.879 --> 16:42.179

did last night I acted like an idiot

20:07.980 --> 20:11.339
I can't believe I spilled what I did to
you about Sean and left there like that

20:11.339 --> 20:13.798
women shouldn't do that to each other

20:13.798 --> 20:16.858

problem not yours and I shouldn't put it

20:24.919 --> 20:31.070

guess in a way i do - it's just you have

20:31.069 --> 20:34.069
to work under him

20:35.140 --> 20:36.750

control freaks I Sean doesn't hurt the

20:41.309 --> 20:42.089
center

20:42.089 --> 20:49.230
he knows so much there are other things
he's just blind to tell me about it and

20:49.230 --> 20:50.430
he's always been like that

20:50.430 --> 20:54.570
like this thing with skipper yesterday a
prominent man on the north shore with a

20:54.569 --> 20:55.829
lot of influence

20:55.829 --> 21:01.799
he's how about a big employer but maybe
there's a way I can help you keep this

21:01.799 --> 21:04.230
place safe from harm

21:04.230 --> 21:08.789
