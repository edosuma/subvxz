WEBVTT

00:01.357 --> 00:03.324
You took this case
without running it by me.

00:03.360 --> 00:04.826
- Jessica--
- That's enough. Dump it.

00:04.861 --> 00:06.094
Or I will.

00:06.129 --> 00:07.028
You think
this case is a winner?

00:07.063 --> 00:08.063
I do.

00:08.064 --> 00:09.597
Then what do you say
we do it together?

00:09.632 --> 00:11.032
(Rachel) I'm afraid you're gonna end up
hating each other.

00:11.067 --> 00:13.267
If I'm lucky, I'm gonna fight
with him about a lot of things.

00:13.303 --> 00:15.753
Why not start with a fight where
we're both on the same side?

00:15.805 --> 00:17.538
This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

00:17.574 --> 00:19.223
and I found them
sitting in the copy machine.

00:19.259 --> 00:20.775
You came to work for me.

00:20.810 --> 00:22.050
You knew who I was
when you did,

00:22.078 --> 00:23.277
so now it's time
for you to decide.

00:23.313 --> 00:24.412
Are you with me or not?

00:24.447 --> 00:26.280
You always said,
once you pick a side,

00:26.316 --> 00:27.315
if you're not loyal
to that side,

00:27.350 --> 00:28.716
then who the hell are you?

00:28.752 --> 00:30.251
You should've thought of that
before you picked someone

00:30.253 --> 00:32.293
who would do something like this
in the first place.

00:33.239 --> 00:36.090
You ever take sides with
Jack Soloff against me again,

00:36.126 --> 00:38.126
I will bury you.

00:42.799 --> 00:45.166
[elevator bell dings]
- Well, you look happy.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.151
Becky just tell Susie
she like-likes you?

00:47.203 --> 00:49.504
Eh, more like Kelton Insurance
just told Robert Zane

00:49.539 --> 00:51.005
they're scared-scared of us.

00:51.041 --> 00:52.006
You got a settlement offer?

00:52.042 --> 00:53.408
Just like he said
we would.

00:53.443 --> 00:55.593
I got to hand it to him,
he played them perfectly.

00:55.645 --> 00:57.311
Did he now?

00:57.364 --> 00:58.379
What?

00:58.415 --> 00:59.415
Nothing.

00:59.416 --> 01:01.015
Look, I take it back
about Becky.

01:01.051 --> 01:02.750
The only one with a crush
around here is you.

01:02.802 --> 01:04.385
Sounds like someone's worried
that Robert Zane

01:04.437 --> 01:05.720
might be better than him.

01:05.772 --> 01:08.689
Nice try, tiger, but did Magic
ever worry about Bird?

01:08.691 --> 01:09.690
First of all, yes, he did.

01:09.692 --> 01:10.792
Second of all, you realize

01:10.827 --> 01:12.043
you're the white guy
in this scenario, right?

01:12.078 --> 01:13.811
I know I'm the bigger badass
in every scenario.

01:13.847 --> 01:17.081
Okay, Mr. Badass, which one
are you, Magic or Bird?

01:17.133 --> 01:18.266
I think we both know
I'm...

01:18.301 --> 01:20.118
(both)
Jordan.

01:20.170 --> 01:22.653
Hey, why don't you go meet
your boyfriend Robert Zane?

01:22.689 --> 01:24.705
I think I just left something
at security.

01:24.741 --> 01:28.376
Oh. Look who like-likes
someone now.

01:28.411 --> 01:30.111
Ma'am, the last time
I let someone up

01:30.146 --> 01:31.712
that he wasn't expecting,

01:31.748 --> 01:33.481
he threatened
to have me executed.

01:33.516 --> 01:36.117
I'm sure he did,
but I'm telling you that--

01:36.152 --> 01:38.453
That Gretchen obviously forgot
to phone down, Carl,

01:38.488 --> 01:41.122
because we have a meeting
scheduled for right now.

01:41.157 --> 01:42.323
That isn't what she just--

01:42.358 --> 01:44.859
Carl.

01:48.765 --> 01:51.365
A meeting with you.
Really?

01:51.418 --> 01:53.134
I promise
I'm much better-looking

01:53.169 --> 01:54.569
than whoever
you were supposed to meet.

01:54.604 --> 01:57.738
You have no idea
how right you are.

01:57.774 --> 01:59.874
But I could have sworn
you were just on your way out.

01:59.909 --> 02:02.176
Oh, that's not a problem.
The mayor can wait.

02:02.212 --> 02:04.846
But I'm not sure
the governor can.

02:04.881 --> 02:06.614
Are you trying
to out-name-drop me?

02:06.649 --> 02:09.150
If I were,
I think I just did.

02:09.185 --> 02:12.587
But I'll let you in
on a little secret.

02:12.622 --> 02:14.956
I don't really care
about names that much.

02:14.991 --> 02:16.390
Well, if you don't care
about names, why don't we

02:16.426 --> 02:18.726
skip the introductions
and just get down to breakfast?

02:18.761 --> 02:20.211
What if I already
had breakfast?

02:20.246 --> 02:22.897
I'm talking about
tomorrow morning, in my kitchen.

02:22.932 --> 02:25.566
Or yours, I mean, you look like
you have a nice place.

02:28.888 --> 02:34.041
As tempting as that is,
maybe another time.

02:36.846 --> 02:38.079
Good luck
in your meeting.

02:42.051 --> 02:44.952
So how's my favorite
pain-in-the-ass lawyer?

02:44.988 --> 02:47.488
I thought Louis was your
favorite pain-in-the-ass lawyer.

02:47.524 --> 02:50.658
He is, but Louis
isn't responsible

02:50.710 --> 02:52.627
for me getting to work
on this.

02:55.999 --> 02:58.332
You're doing the grunt work
on our case?

02:58.368 --> 02:59.967
I pulled some strings--
thought it might give us

03:00.003 --> 03:01.102
a chance
to work together.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.237
You know I'm engaged,
right?

03:03.273 --> 03:04.639
Yes, Mike,
that's my plan,

03:04.674 --> 03:06.374
to steal you
from my boss's daughter.

03:06.409 --> 03:09.377
It's a thing.
It's been done.

03:09.412 --> 03:11.362
Well, I didn't come here
to steal you.

03:11.397 --> 03:13.981
I came here
to thank you.

03:14.017 --> 03:14.949
For what?

03:14.984 --> 03:15.883
Come on, Mike.

03:15.919 --> 03:17.185
I get fired,

03:17.220 --> 03:20.154
and two days later, I get
an offer from Rachel's father?

03:20.190 --> 03:23.424
Whatever you did,
I owe you one.

03:23.459 --> 03:25.359
Actually,
you owe Rachel one.

03:25.395 --> 03:27.128
No shit.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.597
Shit.

03:29.632 --> 03:32.517
(both as Clay Davis from <i> The Wire)</i>
Shiiit.

03:34.404 --> 03:37.438
By the way, you're
in the wrong conference room.

03:43.079 --> 03:44.712
Okay, Esther,
what are you doing here?

03:44.747 --> 03:46.814
What,
a woman can't stop by

03:46.816 --> 03:48.349
to see her brother,
who she loves?

03:48.384 --> 03:51.485
Please, you know damn well
we don't love each other.

03:51.521 --> 03:54.755
In that case,
I need a lawyer.

03:54.791 --> 03:56.424
[laughs]
You? For what?

03:56.459 --> 03:59.594
Did you give someone salmonella
with your stupid muffins?

03:59.629 --> 04:00.962
I'm getting a divorce.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.167
Well, good.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.935
I knew that guy was dead weight
the second I met him.

04:07.971 --> 04:10.538
I know, I think that was
your speech at our wedding.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.373
And your sympathy
is touching,

04:12.408 --> 04:14.659
but I didn't come here
to vindicate you.

04:14.694 --> 04:15.743
No, I know you didn't.

04:15.745 --> 04:17.043
You came to get me

04:17.079 --> 04:19.346
to slaughter Jeffrey for you,
and I will.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.616
When I'm done with him,
he won't have a pot to shit in.

04:21.618 --> 04:23.751
It's "piss in."

04:23.786 --> 04:25.820
And, Louis, I don't want you
to slaughter Jeffrey.

04:25.855 --> 04:26.787
Why the hell not?

04:26.823 --> 04:28.356
Because I want
Harvey Specter to.

04:28.391 --> 04:29.423
Come again?

04:29.459 --> 04:31.025
You said he was
the best attorney in the city.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.927
No, Esther, I told you
he was my best friend.

04:32.962 --> 04:35.296
Which is exactly what you said
about Jeremy Henschell

04:35.331 --> 04:37.081
in tenth grade,
which really meant

04:37.133 --> 04:38.866
you worshipped him
from afar,

04:38.901 --> 04:40.368
you wrote in your diary
about him,

04:40.403 --> 04:42.436
and you never
actually hung out.

04:42.472 --> 04:44.105
Okay, you swore
you never read my diary.

04:44.157 --> 04:46.274
And you swore you didn't spy
on me and Jeremy.

04:46.276 --> 04:47.441
Oh, please,
that was one time.

04:47.493 --> 04:48.943
I was on my way
to get a glass of milk,

04:48.995 --> 04:50.111
and for your information,

04:50.113 --> 04:51.445
I've been lactose intolerant
ever since.

04:51.447 --> 04:52.913
Louis, are you gonna
get me Harvey,

04:52.949 --> 04:54.498
or do I have to get him
myself?

04:54.534 --> 04:57.752
Harvey is not taking on
any new clients right now,

04:57.787 --> 05:00.788
and he's out of town
for the next few years.

05:02.675 --> 05:05.626
Louis, I know
what you're doing.

05:05.678 --> 05:07.628
You think I want Harvey
because I don't think

05:07.630 --> 05:09.213
you're good enough.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.182
You're wrong.

05:11.217 --> 05:13.301
I know how good you are,

05:13.353 --> 05:14.685
but this is personal for me,

05:14.721 --> 05:16.771
which means
it will be personal for you,

05:16.806 --> 05:20.524
and I can't have that.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.811
So please,
will you get me Harvey?

05:25.315 --> 05:28.316
I'll make it happen.

05:29.736 --> 05:32.486
Thank you, Louis.

05:38.628 --> 05:40.161
That was Esther?

05:40.163 --> 05:41.912
Yes, I know what you're gonna
say--we look exactly alike.

05:41.964 --> 05:43.047
That actually wasn't--

05:43.082 --> 05:44.215
I get it--it's like
looking at me in a wig.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.299
I've heard it
a thousand times.

05:45.335 --> 05:48.753
Yeah, the resemblance
is uncanny.

05:48.805 --> 05:50.338
What?

05:50.340 --> 05:51.972
I'm just wondering why you're
not getting up to go ask Harvey.

05:52.008 --> 05:53.174
Because I'm not gonna
ask him.

05:53.176 --> 05:55.226
I'm gonna save some time
and tell her he said no.

05:55.261 --> 05:56.394
Louis--

05:56.429 --> 05:58.562
Donna, we all know
that Harvey's furious at me.

05:58.598 --> 05:59.730
There's no way
he's gonna do it.

05:59.766 --> 06:02.316
Maybe not.

06:02.352 --> 06:04.935
But, Louis, she's family,

06:04.987 --> 06:07.988
and if there's one thing that
Harvey understands, it's that.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.109
Where the hell have you been?

06:12.161 --> 06:14.362
Sorry, I got stuck
in really bad traffic.

06:14.414 --> 06:16.747
So you were
in the wrong conference room.

06:16.783 --> 06:19.200
For about 20 minutes.

06:19.202 --> 06:21.786
So what did we get?

06:21.838 --> 06:23.754
Want to take a guess?

06:23.790 --> 06:24.922
$90 million.

06:24.957 --> 06:27.007
Want to take a real guess?

06:27.043 --> 06:28.043
That was a real guess.

06:28.044 --> 06:29.477
Son, what planet
are you living on?

06:29.512 --> 06:30.478
The planet
where you called

06:30.513 --> 06:32.046
to say we got
a great settlement.

06:32.081 --> 06:35.316
$25 million is
a great settlement.

06:35.351 --> 06:36.283
$25 million?

06:36.319 --> 06:38.052
Robert, after fees,

06:38.087 --> 06:40.121
that's less than $70,000
per person.

06:40.156 --> 06:41.956
[laughs] Then what do you
suggest we counter with?

06:41.991 --> 06:43.691
I suggest we counter
with a trial.

06:43.726 --> 06:45.142
Are you nuts?
You don't go to trial.

06:45.178 --> 06:47.061
You turn up the pressure,
and then you settle.

06:47.063 --> 06:49.163
Going to trial is
turning up the pressure.

06:49.198 --> 06:50.848
The second we finish
opening arguments,

06:50.883 --> 06:52.199
that offer is
gonna triple.

06:52.235 --> 06:54.201
Look, I've sat across the table
from these two

06:54.203 --> 06:55.419
four times
in the last six years,

06:55.471 --> 06:56.754
and when they say
this is their best offer,

06:56.806 --> 06:58.739
it's their best offer,
and we're recommending it.

06:58.775 --> 07:00.074
Well, you can recommend
whatever you want.

07:00.109 --> 07:01.208
I'm recommending
we reject it.

07:01.210 --> 07:04.211
You don't give clients
conflicting opinions.

07:04.247 --> 07:05.647
You work it out
behind closed doors.

07:05.648 --> 07:06.697
Well, maybe that's the problem.

07:06.749 --> 07:08.332
You want to do things
behind closed doors.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.383
I actually want to be honest.

07:09.419 --> 07:10.384
Hey, watch yourself, Mike.

07:10.436 --> 07:13.020
You tell me this,
would $70,000 per person

07:13.022 --> 07:14.755
be a great settlement
if we were talking

07:14.791 --> 07:16.173
about Laura's life
or Rachel's?

07:16.225 --> 07:17.625
You get out of here!

07:17.660 --> 07:18.859
You don't come back

07:18.911 --> 07:20.694
until you wrap your head
around recommending this offer.

07:20.747 --> 07:23.030
And don't you ever
use them against me again!

Don't tell me
he wasn't in here either.

08:07.815 --> 08:09.248
He was in here,
all right.

08:09.283 --> 08:11.784
What happened?
Did the settlement fall through?

08:11.819 --> 08:14.620
No, it didn't,
but it should've.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.189
They gave us a shitty offer.
Robert's ready to take it.

08:17.225 --> 08:19.959
Come on, if it's really
that bad, why would he take it?

08:19.994 --> 08:21.894
Because he knows his clients
will jump all over it

08:21.929 --> 08:23.362
and it's the easy way out.

08:23.397 --> 08:25.397
So you think Robert doesn't care
about his clients?

08:25.433 --> 08:26.532
It sure seems that way.

08:26.567 --> 08:28.601
Mike, I've only been here
a few months,

08:28.636 --> 08:32.104
and there are a lot of things
you can say about Robert Zane,

08:32.139 --> 08:35.073
but what you can't say
is that he doesn't care

08:35.109 --> 08:36.491
about his clients.

08:42.049 --> 08:43.082
Go away, Louis.

08:43.116 --> 08:44.350
I would, but then
I couldn't tell you

08:44.352 --> 08:46.485
about the $50-million company
I'm giving you.

08:46.521 --> 08:47.786
And why would you do that?

08:47.822 --> 08:50.256
'Cause I want to make up
for our little misunderstanding.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.524
We didn't have
a misunderstanding.

08:51.559 --> 08:54.093
You went after my money,
so if you're giving me a client,

08:54.128 --> 08:55.494
there's some other
misunderstanding

08:55.530 --> 08:57.329
that you're too chickenshit
to tell me about.

09:00.101 --> 09:02.468
It's my sister's company.

09:02.503 --> 09:04.136
I'll give you her business.

09:04.171 --> 09:05.905
All you have to do
is handle her divorce.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.389
I don't want
your sister's business.

09:07.425 --> 09:08.474
Now get out.

09:12.847 --> 09:14.747
Harvey, this is my family.

09:14.782 --> 09:18.751
My sister, she...has never
asked me for anything

09:18.786 --> 09:21.020
her entire life,
not once.

09:21.055 --> 09:25.157
Now the one time she does,
I just can't let her down.

09:27.094 --> 09:28.794
Louis, I'm not
a divorce attorney.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.346
When has a shitty detail
like that

09:30.381 --> 09:32.381
ever stopped you before?

09:35.970 --> 09:38.220
All right, I'll do it,
on two conditions.

09:38.272 --> 09:41.440
First, you stay completely
out of this case.

09:41.475 --> 09:43.142
Done. Second?

09:43.144 --> 09:45.377
I'll let you know
when I think of it.

09:45.413 --> 09:47.363
How do I know it won't be
something I can't stomach?

09:47.398 --> 09:50.616
You don't, but those are
my two conditions.

09:50.651 --> 09:54.620
Okay, Harvey,
You have a deal.

09:54.655 --> 09:57.489
One thing.

09:57.491 --> 09:59.992
Promise me you won't
sleep with Esther.

10:00.044 --> 10:02.795
Believe me, Louis,
the last thing I want to do

10:02.830 --> 10:05.831
is sleep with your sister.

10:07.585 --> 10:09.418
(Robert)
I'm glad you agree.

10:09.470 --> 10:12.471
I'll let you know
when the paperwork's finished.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.676
I know you didn't wrap your head
around this deal

10:17.712 --> 10:19.511
in the last ten minutes,

10:19.513 --> 10:21.013
so what are you still
doing in my office?

10:21.015 --> 10:23.182
Exactly what you'd be doing
in my place.

10:23.184 --> 10:25.451
Robert, I know you said
that you know these two lawyers,

10:25.503 --> 10:27.019
but I don't.

10:27.054 --> 10:29.321
I need to see for myself
what they will or won't do.

10:29.357 --> 10:30.623
And you still want
to counter.

10:30.658 --> 10:31.857
I want to at least try.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.452
Except you don't want to go
by yourself,

10:33.461 --> 10:34.393
you want me to go
with you.

10:34.428 --> 10:36.395
Yes, I do.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.063
Because you and I both know,
if we don't go together,

10:38.099 --> 10:39.264
we don't stand a chance.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.935
I know we don't stand a chance
either way.

10:42.970 --> 10:45.170
And if I do go, it makes me
look like a fool.

10:45.206 --> 10:49.742
Robert, I saved you from looking
like a fool in that courtroom.

10:49.777 --> 10:52.277
I came through for you.

10:52.313 --> 10:55.047
Now I'm asking you
to come through for me on this.

10:55.082 --> 10:57.549
You and Rachel are
peas in a pod.

10:57.585 --> 10:59.885
[chuckles]

10:59.920 --> 11:01.754
Can't believe she's really
worth $50 million.

11:01.756 --> 11:03.839
I can't believe you've never
heard of her company.

11:03.891 --> 11:06.158
Do I look like I buy
a lot of potholders?

11:06.193 --> 11:07.493
She doesn't just sell
potholders.

11:07.528 --> 11:09.628
She has a brand
like Martha Stewart.

11:09.664 --> 11:11.563
Look, I get that you think
she's impressive,

11:11.599 --> 11:13.983
but to me,
she's just Louis's sister,

11:14.018 --> 11:16.235
which, as far as I'm concerned,
is strike number two.

11:16.287 --> 11:17.403
What's strike number one?

11:17.455 --> 11:19.004
The fact that
she's Louis's sister.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.956
Oh, come on,
Harvey, listen.

11:21.008 --> 11:23.308
Are you gonna take this
seriously or not?

11:23.344 --> 11:24.309
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

11:24.345 --> 11:25.461
I'm gonna go walk there.

11:25.496 --> 11:26.745
I'm gonna shake
this woman's meaty hand.

11:26.781 --> 11:29.815
I'm gonna get this over with
as quickly as possible.

11:33.804 --> 11:34.804
You?

11:34.822 --> 11:36.355
You've got to be
kidding me.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.856
You two know each other?

11:37.892 --> 11:39.391
So you weren't meeting
the governor.

11:39.427 --> 11:41.460
You're telling me you were
really gonna blow off the mayor?

11:41.495 --> 11:43.662
The mayor.
You don't know the mayor.

11:43.698 --> 11:47.499
I'm so sorry, let me introduce
my soon-to-be former associate.

11:47.535 --> 11:48.801
[chuckles]
Rachel Zane.

11:48.836 --> 11:51.954
Esther Edelstein.

11:51.989 --> 11:54.006
It's nice to finally
meet the man

11:54.008 --> 11:55.441
I've heard
such good things about.

11:55.476 --> 11:56.575
It's nice to meet
the woman

11:56.610 --> 11:59.912
I've obviously heard
nothing but lies about.

12:02.717 --> 12:04.283
Let's get to it.

12:04.335 --> 12:05.384
Yes.

12:05.386 --> 12:07.686
I just have to know,

12:07.722 --> 12:10.255
were one of the two of you
adopted?

12:11.459 --> 12:14.460
I've been asking that
for years.

12:15.362 --> 12:17.329
Hey.
Get out.

12:24.205 --> 12:26.438
Shit.

12:26.474 --> 12:28.794
Come on, speak up, narcissist,
it's not a freakin' library.

12:31.345 --> 12:32.711
Reminder to thin the walls

12:32.747 --> 12:34.897
in the conference room/
make a peephole.

12:34.949 --> 12:35.881
What do you think
you're doing?

12:35.916 --> 12:37.049
What happened?

12:37.051 --> 12:38.050
Oh, I was just checking
the sound-proofing,

12:38.085 --> 12:39.017
making sure
they thicken the walls

12:39.053 --> 12:40.119
in the conference room.

12:40.154 --> 12:41.887
So if I walk out this door
and I turn to the right,

12:41.922 --> 12:43.622
I won't see Harvey
in there with Esther?

12:43.657 --> 12:44.977
Esther's here?
I didn't know that.

12:44.992 --> 12:46.558
Louis, listening
through the wall

12:46.594 --> 12:47.826
is not staying
out of her case,

12:47.862 --> 12:49.728
and if Harvey finds out,
he's gonna drop her.

12:49.764 --> 12:51.897
Look, it's my sister,
All right?

12:51.932 --> 12:53.532
I just want to make sure
he does right by her.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.607
And you never would have
asked him to take this case

12:55.636 --> 12:57.636
if you didn't trust
that he would do just that.

12:57.671 --> 13:00.672
So put the glass down,
go back to your office,

13:00.708 --> 13:02.641
and let him do his job.

13:04.779 --> 13:05.978
You know it'd be easier
for both of us

13:06.013 --> 13:07.930
if you were wrong
every once in a while.

13:11.218 --> 13:13.552
When we decided to get divorced,
Jeffrey and I agreed

13:13.554 --> 13:17.189
he would get 20% of the company,
no need to involve lawyers.

13:17.224 --> 13:20.559
The next thing I knew,
I got a letter from a lawyer.

13:20.594 --> 13:22.728
Jeffrey doesn't think
20% is enough anymore.

13:22.763 --> 13:25.297
No, he doesn't.

13:25.332 --> 13:26.632
Esther, I'm gonna ask you
a question,

13:26.667 --> 13:28.667
and I want you
to answer me honestly.

13:28.702 --> 13:31.069
Who's leaving who?

13:31.105 --> 13:32.137
It's mutual.

13:32.173 --> 13:33.639
It's never mutual.

13:33.674 --> 13:36.625
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Who's driving this decision?

13:38.629 --> 13:39.629
I am.

13:39.630 --> 13:40.913
Then the answer
to our problem

13:40.965 --> 13:42.915
is for you to stay away
from the negotiations.

13:42.917 --> 13:45.918
What?
No, I'm not staying away.

13:45.970 --> 13:46.970
Listen to me.

13:46.971 --> 13:48.220
He's going back on your deal

13:48.255 --> 13:49.671
because he wants
to prolong the fight.

13:49.723 --> 13:50.723
I don't care.

13:50.758 --> 13:52.558
I spent 12 years
building the company.

13:52.593 --> 13:54.426
I'm not gonna sit back
and let someone else decide

13:54.428 --> 13:55.761
how much
I'm allowed to keep.

13:55.813 --> 13:57.013
Then what'd you
come to me for?

13:57.014 --> 13:58.897
Because you're supposed to be
the best.

13:58.933 --> 14:00.816
I am the best,
and I didn't get that way

14:00.851 --> 14:02.601
letting someone else
call the shots.

14:02.653 --> 14:04.319
So you're either gonna
let me do that,

14:04.355 --> 14:06.939
or you're gonna get yourself
another lawyer.

14:11.694 --> 14:13.372
All right, here's what
I need you to do.

14:13.373 --> 14:14.805
You can tell me what you
need me to do in a minute.

14:14.841 --> 14:16.733
First we're gonna talk
about what happened back there.

14:16.734 --> 14:18.851
What happened is,
I laid down the law,

14:18.852 --> 14:20.485
she accepted,
I'm the man.

14:20.487 --> 14:21.619
Yep, uh-huh.

14:21.655 --> 14:23.288
Okay, I'm not talking
about that.

14:23.323 --> 14:25.039
I'm talking about how the moment
you walked through the door,

14:25.091 --> 14:26.641
you looked like you were struck
by a bolt of lighting.

14:26.693 --> 14:28.193
- I did not.
- You most certainly did.

14:28.228 --> 14:30.094
In fact,
before you started fighting,

14:30.130 --> 14:31.930
I was afraid the two of you were
gonna go at it on the table.

14:31.982 --> 14:32.982
Afraid or hoping?

14:32.983 --> 14:34.232
That's unsavory.

14:34.267 --> 14:36.100
And you making lewd comments
about our client isn't?

14:36.136 --> 14:38.002
Lewd comments
about what client?

14:38.038 --> 14:39.571
Harvey likes
Louis's sister.

14:39.606 --> 14:41.706
That's funny, 'cause that's
exactly what I came in here

14:41.741 --> 14:42.674
to talk to him about.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.342
You like Louis's sister?

14:44.377 --> 14:45.677
Not enough to fight you
for her.

14:45.712 --> 14:47.612
Well, you should reconsider.
She's lovely.

14:50.217 --> 14:52.817
And I'm leaving.

14:54.154 --> 14:57.388
Harvey, why are you
all of a sudden

14:57.424 --> 14:59.224
taking on Esther Edelstein
as a client?

14:59.276 --> 15:01.693
And don't tell me
it's because she's lovely,

15:01.728 --> 15:03.428
because I'm not sure
I believe that.

15:03.463 --> 15:05.230
I took her on
because Louis asked me to.

15:05.265 --> 15:07.866
And the last I heard, you and I
were both pissed at him.

15:07.901 --> 15:09.701
And I still am.

15:09.736 --> 15:11.102
But he told me
this was family,

15:11.137 --> 15:13.771
and...I thought
this might be a chance

15:13.807 --> 15:15.740
for us all to get
back on track.

15:15.775 --> 15:17.342
I like that, Harvey.

15:17.377 --> 15:18.393
You just might turn out

15:18.445 --> 15:21.329
to be a half decent name partner
after all.

15:22.832 --> 15:23.832
I doubt it.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.783
So do I.

15:27.554 --> 15:29.170
Well, frankly, Robert,
I'm surprised

15:29.206 --> 15:30.288
you called
for another meeting.

15:30.323 --> 15:32.056
Surprised
by a routine counter?

15:32.108 --> 15:35.126
When the first offer is
as generous as ours, I am.

15:35.161 --> 15:37.795
Just hear the man out,
Will.

15:37.831 --> 15:40.798
Campbell v. State Health.
Wilson v. GenRX.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.901
Friedman v. MedFirst.

15:42.936 --> 15:44.216
Those are
identical class actions

15:44.237 --> 15:45.169
in which the average payout

15:45.205 --> 15:46.905
was $1/2 million
per plaintiff.

15:46.940 --> 15:49.107
They were jury awards,
and two of them were reduced

15:49.142 --> 15:50.575
for being
excessively punitive.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.644
Dollar amount was still higher
than what's on the table.

15:52.679 --> 15:53.962
After seven years
of appeals.

15:54.014 --> 15:56.114
Yeah, and like we said,
we don't care how long it takes.

15:56.149 --> 15:57.982
We want triple
what you're offering.

15:58.018 --> 16:00.285
And I want to skinny dip
with Sofia Vergara,

16:00.320 --> 16:02.153
but <i> no puedo hacerlo.</i>

16:02.188 --> 16:04.622
That's Spanish for "we're not
giving you another nickel."

16:04.658 --> 16:06.791
And what's Spanish
for "we'll see you in court"?

16:06.826 --> 16:07.826
Bring it on.

16:07.827 --> 16:08.793
That's enough.
Come on, Will.

16:08.795 --> 16:09.961
We're just having
a conversation.

16:09.963 --> 16:11.279
Conversation?

16:11.314 --> 16:12.830
I gave you
a fair offer, Robert,

16:12.866 --> 16:14.432
because I respect you,

16:14.467 --> 16:16.234
and I thought that
you respected me enough to know

16:16.269 --> 16:18.636
that I meant it when I said
it's the best I could do.

16:18.672 --> 16:20.872
Then he comes in here
threatening a trial.

16:20.907 --> 16:21.940
Well, you know what?

16:21.975 --> 16:23.708
You don't like
what's on the table,

16:23.760 --> 16:26.377
we can pull
the whole damn thing.

16:29.783 --> 16:31.049
I told you
he wasn't messing around.

16:31.084 --> 16:32.124
You were right about that.

16:32.152 --> 16:33.651
Now I'm right
about taking this to trial.

16:33.687 --> 16:35.270
You aren't right
about anything.

16:35.322 --> 16:36.988
I owed you. I paid up.
We're done.

16:37.023 --> 16:38.156
No, we're not done,
and I'm still not

16:38.191 --> 16:39.774
recommending this offer
to my clients.

16:39.826 --> 16:42.877
Well, that's too bad,
because they already signed off.

16:42.912 --> 16:45.897
What?

16:45.949 --> 16:48.199
You talked to our clients
before we even went in there?

16:48.234 --> 16:49.500
You're damn right I did.

16:49.536 --> 16:51.402
We took a shot,
and it didn't work.

16:51.438 --> 16:52.870
Now, in the meantime,
we had an obligation

16:52.906 --> 16:54.639
to show their offer
to our clients, and I did.

16:54.674 --> 16:56.407
Don't give me
some bullshit justification.

16:56.443 --> 16:57.809
You went behind my back.

16:57.811 --> 17:00.561
I didn't go behind your back.
I went over your head.

17:00.597 --> 17:02.246
What the hell
are you talking about?

17:02.282 --> 17:03.698
You know what the hell
I'm talking about.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.917
I went to your boss's boss,
and you know what?

17:06.953 --> 17:08.619
She and I see things
the same way.

17:08.655 --> 17:10.821
And as far as I'm concerned,
this case is settled.

17:16.579 --> 17:19.696
Why don't you two have a seat?
I suggest we get right to it.

17:19.749 --> 17:21.214
Wait a second,
where's Esther?

17:21.251 --> 17:23.334
She won't be joining us,
but I've been authorized

17:23.369 --> 17:24.669
to negotiate
on her behalf.

17:24.704 --> 17:28.406
No. No, I'm not agreeing
to anything without her here.

17:28.441 --> 17:30.241
That's because you don't really
want to negotiate,

17:30.276 --> 17:31.576
you just want to stay
connected to her,

17:31.578 --> 17:33.044
and that's not
gonna happen.

17:33.079 --> 17:35.013
I don't know when you decided
to become a divorce attorney,

17:35.048 --> 17:36.481
but that's not
how it works.

17:36.516 --> 17:37.836
I didn't become
a divorce attorney

17:37.851 --> 17:39.183
because it's
the minor leagues,

17:39.219 --> 17:41.869
but this is how it works
with me.

17:43.356 --> 17:44.272
What the hell is this?

17:44.307 --> 17:46.024
That's our new offer,
nothing.

17:46.059 --> 17:46.991
This is bullshit.

17:46.993 --> 17:48.826
You thinking
you deserve even 20%

17:48.862 --> 17:50.778
of our client's business
is bullshit.

17:50.814 --> 17:52.230
So you're either gonna
accept the terms

17:52.265 --> 17:55.266
that you and Esther agreed to,
or you can take our new offer.

17:55.301 --> 17:57.568
You can threaten all you want,
but my client has a right

17:57.604 --> 18:00.338
to what's his,
and that's half the company,

18:00.373 --> 18:03.508
because 12 years ago, that's
what your client agreed to.

18:03.543 --> 18:05.843
See, I wasn't just gonna be
Esther's husband.

18:05.879 --> 18:09.013
I was gonna be a doctor,
but I put that on hold

18:09.015 --> 18:10.915
while Esther got her company
off the ground,

18:10.950 --> 18:13.451
and when I said
I was willing to do that,

18:13.486 --> 18:14.786
she said I'd get half.

18:14.821 --> 18:17.355
Which constitutes
an enforceable verbal contract.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.774
(Jeffrey) So I don't care
whether Esther's here or not.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.075
She promised to spend
our lives together,

18:21.127 --> 18:23.594
and she's breaking
that promise.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.296
There's nothing I can do
about that one,

18:25.348 --> 18:27.298
but I'm sure as hell gonna
hold her to the other one.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.517
You have no proof
she ever made that promise.

18:29.552 --> 18:31.602
Ask your client about it,
because when we depose her

18:31.638 --> 18:34.355
under oath,
you can rest assured we will.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:49.941 --> 18:51.524
You authorized
the settlement?

18:51.560 --> 18:52.909
You want to change
that tone?

18:52.961 --> 18:54.144
No, I don't,
because you told

18:54.179 --> 18:55.562
Robert Zane to treat me
like a partner,

18:55.597 --> 18:57.263
and then you turned around,
and you cut my legs out.

18:57.299 --> 18:59.032
I told him that
because you were my proxy,

18:59.067 --> 19:00.967
but you're not my proxy
with me.

19:01.003 --> 19:03.670
And I don't appreciate
my decisions being questioned.

19:03.705 --> 19:04.945
Did you even look
at that offer?

19:04.973 --> 19:07.357
Mike, I'm going to explain
something to you that,

19:07.392 --> 19:09.075
based on your approach
to this conversation,

19:09.111 --> 19:10.944
you clearly don't understand.

19:10.979 --> 19:12.379
This trial
will cost millions.

19:12.414 --> 19:13.913
And Arcadian has
deep pockets.

19:13.949 --> 19:16.149
And they're not looking
to empty them on a gamble.

19:16.184 --> 19:17.617
So this is all
just about the money.

19:17.653 --> 19:19.986
Were you born yesterday?

19:20.022 --> 19:21.655
The clients are looking
for money.

19:21.690 --> 19:22.889
We're looking for money.

19:22.924 --> 19:26.459
The insurance company's
looking to keep money.

19:26.495 --> 19:27.694
It's always
about the money.

19:27.729 --> 19:30.664
And if you had some balls,
we'd get a whole lot more.

19:33.735 --> 19:35.869
Listen to me,
I don't know what you thought

19:35.921 --> 19:38.872
marching in here was going to do
other than piss me off,

19:38.907 --> 19:40.874
but you're going to march
the hell back out

19:40.926 --> 19:43.943
because I have better things
to do with my time

19:43.945 --> 19:47.614
than to explain to you
how the world works.

19:49.868 --> 19:51.151
[scoffs]

19:51.186 --> 19:53.653
Hey, I got your message.

19:53.689 --> 19:55.472
Jeffrey signed the agreement?

19:55.524 --> 19:56.940
He did.

19:56.992 --> 19:59.426
All it needs
is your John Hancock.

20:04.566 --> 20:07.500
Wait, this doesn't say 20%.
It says 50%.

20:07.536 --> 20:10.270
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I forget to mention

20:10.305 --> 20:12.806
that he said you promised him
50% of your company

20:12.841 --> 20:14.041
for putting off
medical school?

20:14.042 --> 20:17.911
Because you sure forgot
to mention that to me.

20:17.946 --> 20:19.279
[laughs]

20:19.314 --> 20:20.547
You have got to be
kidding me.

20:20.582 --> 20:21.548
How could you not
tell me that?

20:21.600 --> 20:23.516
Because it was
a throwaway conversation

20:23.552 --> 20:25.719
we had 12 years ago
on the New Jersey Turnpike.

20:25.721 --> 20:27.721
Well, it wasn't throwaway
to him, and he's gonna use it

20:27.773 --> 20:29.155
because he's feeling
betrayed.

20:29.191 --> 20:30.557
Well, I don't really care
what he's feeling

20:30.609 --> 20:33.059
because he's the one
who had the affair.

20:35.731 --> 20:38.031
You wanted to know the
circumstances of our divorce.

20:38.066 --> 20:39.899
Well, that's what they are.

20:39.901 --> 20:41.651
That's why I'm leaving him.

20:41.703 --> 20:43.903
I am sure you wouldn't
understand what's it like

20:43.955 --> 20:47.457
to experience infidelity.

20:47.492 --> 20:49.909
I would, and I do,

20:49.911 --> 20:52.212
but that doesn't change the fact
that you made a contract.

20:52.247 --> 20:54.547
What about our other contract?
20%.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.833
The original agreement
supersedes it,

20:56.885 --> 20:59.753
and an affair
doesn't change that.

20:59.755 --> 21:01.921
Except he doesn't have
any proof

21:01.923 --> 21:03.840
I ever made
the original agreement.

21:03.892 --> 21:05.725
Esther, they're gonna
put you under oath

21:05.761 --> 21:08.728
and ask you point-blank
if this happened.

21:08.764 --> 21:10.563
And I'm going to say
it didn't.

21:10.599 --> 21:12.482
That's perjury, and I'm not
gonna let you do that.

21:12.517 --> 21:13.900
What are you,
some white knight

21:13.935 --> 21:15.518
who never crosses the line
to win?

21:15.570 --> 21:17.403
No, but I'm not gonna let you
make a decision

21:17.439 --> 21:18.571
in the heat of the moment

21:18.607 --> 21:19.939
that you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

21:19.991 --> 21:22.609
Well, then you better find some
other way to void this deal,

21:22.611 --> 21:25.445
because there's no way
I'm giving my shit bag husband

21:25.447 --> 21:28.181
half of everything I own.

21:32.087 --> 21:33.953
I need you to find
every loophole there is

21:34.005 --> 21:36.256
around verbal contracts.

21:36.291 --> 21:37.674
So Jeffrey was
telling the truth?

21:37.709 --> 21:39.559
Yes, and she'd rather
slit her wrists

21:39.594 --> 21:41.461
than give him 50%,
and I don't blame her.

21:41.496 --> 21:43.396
Yeah, but she's the one
who's leaving him, so--

21:46.001 --> 21:47.867
He cheated on her,
didn't he?

21:47.903 --> 21:51.171
Well, that's between our client
and her soon-to-be ex-husband,

21:51.206 --> 21:52.539
and I have no intention
of letting him

21:52.591 --> 21:54.507
get the better of her.

21:55.677 --> 21:57.010
What?

21:57.045 --> 22:00.213
You're being protective.
It's sweet.

22:00.248 --> 22:01.848
Okay, listen to me,
we're protecting Esther

22:01.883 --> 22:04.217
because it's our job
to protect her.

22:04.252 --> 22:06.052
And if we don't figure
a way out of this,

22:06.054 --> 22:07.754
she's gonna lose
millions of dollars,

22:07.789 --> 22:10.089
so you want to make observations
about the two of us,

22:10.125 --> 22:12.742
do it all you want
after we've won.

22:12.794 --> 22:14.727
I'm on it.

22:17.999 --> 22:22.485
Okay, so final deal memos here,
check authorizations here.

22:22.521 --> 22:27.340
Now all we need to do is get
Kelton to sign, and we are done.

22:29.661 --> 22:32.278
Mike, I know you think
this deal sucks,

22:32.314 --> 22:34.814
but there is
a silver lining.

22:34.850 --> 22:36.716
We got to work together
again.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.669
What?

22:39.721 --> 22:41.621
I was just thinking
about when we started.

22:41.656 --> 22:43.156
Who would've thought that
working with you

22:43.191 --> 22:45.725
would ever have been
a silver lining?

22:45.777 --> 22:47.060
Me?

22:47.095 --> 22:48.061
[laughs]
Yeah, you.

22:48.063 --> 22:49.162
What about you?

22:49.197 --> 22:50.396
What are you talking about?

22:50.398 --> 22:52.365
I have been a gentleman
since day one.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.633
- Really?
- Yes.

22:53.685 --> 22:55.235
Remember the whole
airplane incident?

22:55.270 --> 22:58.171
Do I?
Yes, you were the one who--

23:00.075 --> 23:02.492
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:02.527 --> 23:03.943
Wait a second.
Delta Financial.

23:03.979 --> 23:05.011
What about them?

23:05.046 --> 23:06.412
There was a brochure
for Delta Bauer Financial

23:06.448 --> 23:08.081
on Robert Zane's desk.

23:08.116 --> 23:09.449
And on top of that,
they were listed

23:09.484 --> 23:11.918
as a subsidiary
on Arcadian's annual report.

23:11.953 --> 23:13.686
As are 50 other funds.

23:13.722 --> 23:16.931
50 other funds that don't have a
brochure on Robert Zane's desk.

23:16.931 --> 23:18.180
Mike--

23:18.216 --> 23:19.632
Katrina, I need to know
if they're one of your clients.

23:19.667 --> 23:20.749
You know
I can't tell you that.

23:20.751 --> 23:21.851
Okay, well,
you just did.

23:21.886 --> 23:23.652
Now I need to know
if they own shares of Kelton.

23:23.688 --> 23:25.888
I don't know if they own shares,
and I'm not gonna find out.

23:25.923 --> 23:28.324
You don't care if Robert Zane
is manipulating a case

23:28.359 --> 23:29.359
to service a hedge fund?

23:29.360 --> 23:30.659
It doesn't matter
if I care.

23:30.711 --> 23:31.994
I can't violate
attorney-client privilege.

23:32.046 --> 23:33.529
You said you owe me.

23:33.564 --> 23:35.397
And you said
I owe Rachel.

23:35.433 --> 23:37.500
Katrina, please.

23:37.535 --> 23:39.568
You said that Robert is
doing right by his clients.

23:39.604 --> 23:41.504
Well, I just need to know
which clients

23:41.506 --> 23:43.405
he's doing right by.

23:45.443 --> 23:46.976
[sighs]

23:51.148 --> 23:54.316
Hey.
Do you have a minute?

23:54.352 --> 23:57.319
The last time I asked you that,
you told me the answer was no.

23:57.355 --> 23:59.021
And I still gave you
the minute.

23:59.056 --> 24:00.589
Well, I happen to be
in the middle

24:00.625 --> 24:02.558
of trying to get Louis's sister
out of a huge mess, so--

24:02.593 --> 24:04.043
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

24:04.095 --> 24:05.455
Louis promised
to stay out of this.

24:05.479 --> 24:07.796
And he is, and I'm not here
because he asked me to be.

24:07.832 --> 24:09.098
I'm here because I care
about him and--

24:09.100 --> 24:11.133
That's not my problem.

24:11.168 --> 24:13.302
Harvey, I'm not
the enemy here.

24:13.337 --> 24:15.437
And Louis is your partner
and your friend,

24:15.473 --> 24:17.139
and right now, he needs
a little reassurance.

24:17.174 --> 24:18.841
And I told you before,
I'm not the guy

24:18.843 --> 24:20.426
that gives you a hug
when you're scared.

24:20.478 --> 24:22.228
I'm the guy that wins
when you need it the most.

24:22.263 --> 24:23.345
Why can't you for once--

24:23.397 --> 24:24.847
You know what, Donna,
when I came to you for help,

24:24.882 --> 24:26.582
you said that I don't
get to do that anymore.

24:26.617 --> 24:28.137
Well, you don't get
to do this anymore.

24:28.152 --> 24:31.587
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

24:33.157 --> 24:35.057
You know what,
Harvey?

24:35.092 --> 24:36.959
Louis was afraid to let you
take this case,

24:36.994 --> 24:39.194
and I told him not to be
because I trusted

24:39.230 --> 24:40.629
that at the end of the day,

24:40.665 --> 24:43.098
you'd remember
that we're family.

24:43.134 --> 24:45.267
But maybe I was wrong.

24:45.303 --> 24:47.803
Because I spent 12 years
putting you first,

24:47.838 --> 24:51.006
and the day I finally decided
to do something for myself,

24:51.042 --> 24:53.642
you didn't just stop
treating me like family,

24:53.678 --> 24:56.595
you started treating me
like a stranger.

24:56.647 --> 24:59.331
And for your information,
that is a thousand times worse

24:59.367 --> 25:02.685
than if you treated me
like your enemy.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.167
Louis, did you need
something?

25:18.202 --> 25:20.536
I need you to know
how proud I am of you,

25:20.571 --> 25:22.271
'cause seeing you working
like this

25:22.306 --> 25:24.907
just reminds me how
you persevered with the LSATs

25:24.942 --> 25:27.309
and how you got into law school,
and now--

25:27.345 --> 25:28.577
Louis, I'm not telling you
about Esther's case.

25:28.613 --> 25:31.463
Well, then what the hell
good are you?

25:31.515 --> 25:34.350
Louis, you promised Harvey
you would stay out of it.

25:34.385 --> 25:35.634
I just need to know
what happened.

25:35.686 --> 25:36.686
What happened with what?

25:36.687 --> 25:38.020
What happened with them.

25:38.055 --> 25:39.775
I mean, it's no secret
that I hated Jeffrey,

25:39.807 --> 25:43.559
but Esther,
she loved him,

25:43.611 --> 25:46.779
and for them to just--

25:46.814 --> 25:49.131
I need to know why.

25:51.435 --> 25:54.069
He cheated on her.

26:01.078 --> 26:04.213
Well, then you promise me
that the two of you...

26:04.248 --> 26:06.298
stick it
to that sack of shit.

26:06.334 --> 26:09.418
What do you think
I'm working on?

26:22.380 --> 26:23.818
We're all squared away
on the paperwork?

26:23.819 --> 26:25.204
No, we're not squared away
on shit

26:25.205 --> 26:26.554
until you tell me
whether or not you knew.

26:26.591 --> 26:27.957
You want to run that
by me again?

26:27.992 --> 26:29.825
Delta Financial,
your client.

26:29.861 --> 26:31.694
Did you know they were
heavily invested in Kelton?

26:31.729 --> 26:33.262
Are you accusing me
of something, Mike?

26:33.297 --> 26:34.680
Because you better watch
what you say.

26:34.715 --> 26:35.931
You still haven't answered
my question.

26:35.983 --> 26:37.683
Did you know a subsidiary
of the hedge fund

26:37.735 --> 26:40.936
backing our suit just purchased
a huge block of Kelton shares?

26:40.972 --> 26:43.305
I am their lawyer,
not a stock analyst.

26:43.307 --> 26:46.008
Then maybe you can
explain to me why you have

26:46.043 --> 26:48.244
one of their brochures
on your desk?

26:48.279 --> 26:51.780
Okay, listen to me,
Mr. Photographic Memory.

26:51.816 --> 26:54.717
Underneath this brochure
are another 35

26:54.752 --> 26:56.485
that have been piling up there
for a year and a half

26:56.520 --> 26:57.686
because I'm looking
to invest my money

26:57.722 --> 26:59.088
that someday may be going
to your children.

26:59.123 --> 27:01.156
Wait, you think we want money
that comes from some stock

27:01.192 --> 27:02.524
that went through the roof
because you authorized

27:02.560 --> 27:04.326
a settlement
lower than street expectations?

27:04.362 --> 27:06.896
Okay, you've said your piece.
Now I'm gonna say mine.

27:06.931 --> 27:09.865
I have been a lawyer
and an officer of the court

27:09.901 --> 27:12.968
longer than
you've breathed air,

27:13.004 --> 27:14.169
and I'm looking you
straight in the eye

27:14.205 --> 27:16.672
and telling you
that I am an honest man.

27:16.707 --> 27:19.541
You know as an honest man that
now that we've discovered this,

27:19.577 --> 27:22.044
we have to disclose it
as conflict of interest.

27:22.079 --> 27:26.115
Then bury it,
deep in the fine print,

27:26.150 --> 27:28.150
because it had nothing to do
with my recommendation,

27:28.185 --> 27:32.288
and I'm not gonna let it
blow this goddamn deal.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.837
Since when did this become
a deposition?

27:48.873 --> 27:52.641
It didn't, but since you seemed
so anxious to ask Esther

27:52.677 --> 27:54.243
about what she said
in the past,

27:54.278 --> 27:56.078
I thought I'd just save us
all the trouble

27:56.113 --> 27:57.613
and get it
on the record myself.

27:57.648 --> 27:59.682
What?
I never agreed--

27:59.717 --> 28:03.319
You promised Jeffrey
50% of your company, didn't you?

28:06.657 --> 28:08.424
Yes, I did.

28:08.459 --> 28:09.391
Then it's settled.

28:09.427 --> 28:10.659
Well, not quite.

28:10.711 --> 28:12.861
Now that our client has admitted
that she made the agreement,

28:12.897 --> 28:14.213
we'd like to discuss
the circumstances

28:14.248 --> 28:15.397
under which she did.

28:15.433 --> 28:17.433
What do you mean
the circumstances?

28:17.468 --> 28:19.134
She promised me 50%,
period.

28:19.170 --> 28:22.738
No, she promised you 50%
because you forfeited

28:22.773 --> 28:24.053
your admission
to medical school.

28:24.075 --> 28:26.208
That's right, and instead
of going to Stanford,

28:26.243 --> 28:28.744
I stayed home
and took care of our family.

28:28.779 --> 28:30.012
(Rachel) Then why is there
no record of you

28:30.047 --> 28:32.581
ever being admitted
to Stanford?

28:32.616 --> 28:35.167
Or any school,
for that matter?

28:35.219 --> 28:38.487
Just a pile
of rejection letters.

28:40.107 --> 28:41.156
You lied to me?

28:41.192 --> 28:42.925
This is ridiculous.

28:42.927 --> 28:44.743
Lots of people
don't get into medical school

28:44.779 --> 28:46.028
on the first try.

28:46.063 --> 28:48.630
You were gonna take half
of my company on the first try.

28:48.632 --> 28:49.632
30%.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.216
He's not getting
another penny

28:51.268 --> 28:53.268
of the business
I built myself.

28:53.304 --> 28:55.137
(Jeffrey) You want to talk
about doing things yourself?

28:55.189 --> 28:58.807
Who do you think stayed home
and kept our family together

28:58.859 --> 29:00.526
while you were too busy
baking muffins

29:00.561 --> 29:01.810
to make dinner
for your kids?

29:01.812 --> 29:03.812
(Esther) Don't you dare attack me
as a mother!

29:03.864 --> 29:05.981
You cheated on me!

29:05.983 --> 29:09.284
Esther, I'm sorry.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.071
I made a mistake.

29:12.123 --> 29:14.456
But I did give up everything
for you.

29:14.492 --> 29:16.709
I put my life on hold.

29:16.744 --> 29:18.827
I sacrificed my dream
for yours.

29:18.829 --> 29:19.995
I'm never gonna get
those years back.

29:20.047 --> 29:21.830
(Esther)
No, Jeffrey.

29:21.832 --> 29:24.833
We had everything,

29:24.835 --> 29:26.218
and you ruined it.

29:26.253 --> 29:29.972
All right, that's enough.

29:30.007 --> 29:33.008
You have our final offer.

29:36.180 --> 29:38.430
This better not be
about Robert Zane again.

29:38.482 --> 29:40.749
- Just give me one minute.
- God damn it.

29:40.785 --> 29:42.785
One of his clients purchased
shares of Kelton,

29:42.820 --> 29:44.620
and if they acted
on privileged information--

29:44.655 --> 29:45.888
I know the law.

29:45.923 --> 29:47.322
Well, then you know
it's unethical at best

29:47.358 --> 29:50.092
and illegal at worst.

29:50.127 --> 29:52.227
What do you want from me?

29:52.263 --> 29:53.663
I want to know
if you think he knew.

29:53.697 --> 29:55.431
What the hell difference
does that make?

29:55.466 --> 29:57.099
It's the difference
between a legitimate settlement

29:57.134 --> 29:58.700
and stock manipulation.

29:58.736 --> 30:01.670
You mean it would make him
a fraud?

30:04.175 --> 30:05.941
This isn't the same thing,
and you know it.

30:05.976 --> 30:07.776
I'm not trying to screw over
my clients.

30:07.778 --> 30:09.328
Why would you even bring that up
right now?

30:09.380 --> 30:10.740
Because you begged me
for this case

30:10.765 --> 30:12.448
and a chance to work
with that man.

30:12.483 --> 30:13.715
And if he colluded with them,

30:13.751 --> 30:15.984
we can stick a better settlement
down their throats.

30:16.020 --> 30:19.121
Do you really think Robert Zane
is dirty enough to do that?

30:19.156 --> 30:21.223
I don't know,
but I find it hard to believe

30:21.258 --> 30:22.758
that he's dumb enough
not to know.

30:22.793 --> 30:26.261
My dad's not dumb.

30:26.297 --> 30:27.729
- And he's not dirty.
- Rachel...

30:27.765 --> 30:30.065
And the last time
someone called him shady,

30:30.101 --> 30:32.501
it was Louis, and you
almost punched him over it.

30:32.536 --> 30:33.536
This is different.

30:33.537 --> 30:35.270
This is the same.

30:35.306 --> 30:37.473
You were gonna punch him
because an attack on me

30:37.508 --> 30:39.341
is an attack on you.

30:39.376 --> 30:41.660
Well, attack on my father
is an attack on me,

30:41.712 --> 30:42.978
and you're the one
who's doing it.

30:43.013 --> 30:44.179
Nobody's attacking anybody.

30:44.215 --> 30:47.216
Mike, you once came to me

30:47.251 --> 30:50.519
asking me to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

30:50.554 --> 30:52.821
and I gave it to you.

30:52.857 --> 30:55.257
So the least you can do
is give it to him.

31:05.069 --> 31:06.935
I was hoping
you had good news,

31:06.971 --> 31:10.873
but you're not pouring that
drink because we have a deal.

31:10.908 --> 31:13.575
We don't, but we can.

31:13.611 --> 31:16.578
What are you saying?

31:16.647 --> 31:21.750
I'm saying they offered 30%,
and I talked them down to 25%.

31:21.785 --> 31:23.185
And why should I take it?

31:23.220 --> 31:25.721
Because he's not the one
dragging this fight out anymore.

31:25.756 --> 31:26.855
You are.

31:26.891 --> 31:28.757
And whether or not you believe

31:28.792 --> 31:30.976
he gave up everything for you,
he does.

31:33.264 --> 31:36.231
Tell me I don't have the right
to be angry.

31:38.552 --> 31:40.953
Do you know why
I never even considered

31:40.988 --> 31:42.337
becoming a divorce attorney?

31:42.373 --> 31:44.289
Because it's beneath you.

31:44.325 --> 31:47.593
Because there are children
involved.

31:47.628 --> 31:52.664
When people get caught up
in divorce...

31:52.700 --> 31:54.300
they forget
there are some things in life

31:54.301 --> 31:56.134
that are more important
than money.

32:03.711 --> 32:06.511
Okay, Harvey.

32:06.547 --> 32:08.146
25%.

32:15.689 --> 32:18.907
You know,
you're not exactly

32:18.943 --> 32:21.093
the Harvey Specter
I was expecting.

32:21.128 --> 32:23.128
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

32:23.163 --> 32:24.663
A good thing.

32:24.698 --> 32:27.866
You're not exactly the
Louis's sister I was expecting.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.484
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

32:29.536 --> 32:33.171
A good thing.
Definitely a good thing.

32:35.843 --> 32:40.045
Would you like
to take me home tonight?

32:40.097 --> 32:41.763
I would.

32:41.799 --> 32:43.932
But I need you
to sign that first.

32:43.968 --> 32:45.117
Why is that?

32:45.152 --> 32:48.020
Because then you won't be
my client anymore.

32:51.141 --> 32:53.058
A man with a code.

32:55.062 --> 32:57.479
Maybe you are a white knight
after all.

32:57.531 --> 33:00.616
Come on,
let's get out of here.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.445
Louis, it's midnight.
What's--

33:18.480 --> 33:19.613
Harvey's screwing Esther.

33:19.648 --> 33:21.949
- What?
- Look at this.

33:21.984 --> 33:23.750
It's an agreement
that Esther signed

33:23.786 --> 33:25.719
that agrees
to give Jeffrey 25%.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.188
That's 5% more than she needs
to pay that son of a bitch.

33:28.224 --> 33:29.323
Where did you get this?

33:29.358 --> 33:30.390
Well, I was walking
down the hall.

33:30.426 --> 33:33.293
I saw two glasses,
a bottle of scotch, and that.

33:33.329 --> 33:34.695
He got her drunk,
so he could screw me over.

33:34.730 --> 33:39.199
Okay, there is no way
Harvey would ever do that.

33:39.235 --> 33:41.368
You woke me up in the middle
of the night to tell me that?

33:41.403 --> 33:44.137
Donna, 5% extra is $3 million.
How do you explain that?

33:44.173 --> 33:45.839
- I can't.
- I can.

33:45.874 --> 33:47.708
He's trying to get me back
about his compensation

33:47.743 --> 33:49.209
by trying to screw over
another Litt.

33:49.211 --> 33:50.544
So what I need you to do--

33:50.579 --> 33:52.379
Louis, the only thing
that I need to do

33:52.414 --> 33:54.581
is tell you you're crazy
and go back to sleep.

33:54.617 --> 33:57.417
And if you do anything
between now and tomorrow

33:57.453 --> 33:59.886
other than confront Harvey
face-to-face, so help me God,

33:59.922 --> 34:02.122
you will not have a secretary
in the morning.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.135
Hey.

34:15.170 --> 34:18.105
Hey.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.438
I'm letting it go.

34:19.475 --> 34:20.806
Does that have
something to do

34:20.842 --> 34:22.609
with where you've been
so early in the morning?

34:22.645 --> 34:24.478
Yeah.

34:24.513 --> 34:25.445
You went to see my dad?

34:25.481 --> 34:26.913
I went to see Emma Powell,

34:26.949 --> 34:30.751
asked her how she felt
about the settlement.

34:30.786 --> 34:32.252
She said it would
change her life.

34:32.288 --> 34:34.321
You said
it wasn't enough money.

34:34.356 --> 34:36.023
She didn't even
mention the money.

34:36.058 --> 34:37.824
She said, for her,
the settlement was proof

34:37.860 --> 34:39.793
that Kelton didn't do right
by her husband,

34:39.828 --> 34:41.728
and that was
all she needed.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.496
[chuckles]
Okay.

34:43.532 --> 34:44.891
So because the plaintiff
was happy,

34:44.900 --> 34:46.533
all of a sudden, you think
my dad's an honest man.

34:46.568 --> 34:48.368
No.

34:48.404 --> 34:50.904
I went there to see
if I could let it go.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.141
I know your dad is
an honest man

34:55.177 --> 34:58.745
because he's raised
someone like you.

34:58.781 --> 35:00.447
You were right.

35:00.499 --> 35:04.551
I never should have
questioned his integrity.

35:04.586 --> 35:06.186
I was also right

35:06.221 --> 35:08.221
that you never
should've taken this case.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.490
No, you were wrong
about that.

35:10.492 --> 35:12.793
I told you
we might fight,

35:12.828 --> 35:14.561
but it would bring us
closer together,

35:14.596 --> 35:16.563
and it did.

35:16.598 --> 35:18.231
And not just
me and your father.

35:18.267 --> 35:19.399
What does that mean?

35:19.435 --> 35:21.635
I mean you and your father.

35:21.670 --> 35:22.936
[chuckles]

35:22.971 --> 35:24.538
I have never seen you leap
to his defense like that.

35:24.573 --> 35:27.808
I did leap to his defense,
didn't I?

35:27.860 --> 35:29.459
You sure did.

35:34.516 --> 35:36.183
You think our daughter
will leap to my defense

35:36.218 --> 35:38.568
like that one day?

35:38.604 --> 35:40.604
She sure will.

35:50.766 --> 35:52.999
Louis, what are you
doing here?

35:53.001 --> 35:54.434
I'll tell you what
I'm doing here.

35:54.470 --> 35:56.670
I'm coming to you face-to-face
about screwing my sister.

35:56.672 --> 35:58.238
Excuse me?

35:58.273 --> 36:00.273
I saw the terms, Harvey.
They're a joke.

36:00.309 --> 36:02.809
No, they're what
Esther wanted.

36:02.811 --> 36:05.145
And you swore
you'd stay out of this.

36:05.180 --> 36:06.947
Well, it's a good thing
I didn't

36:06.999 --> 36:08.331
because there's no way
she wanted to give away

36:08.384 --> 36:09.783
millions of dollars.

36:09.818 --> 36:11.918
It's called being charitable
in order to move on.

36:11.954 --> 36:13.987
It's called
Jeffrey's a piece of shit,

36:14.022 --> 36:15.539
not the March of Dimes.

36:15.591 --> 36:16.490
He should be
getting nothing.

36:16.525 --> 36:18.658
Instead of being focused
on what he gets,

36:18.711 --> 36:20.594
you should be focused
on what Esther gets,

36:20.629 --> 36:21.629
which is to be happy.

36:21.630 --> 36:22.863
Wrong, Litts are never happy,

36:22.898 --> 36:23.847
and you're using her
to get to me.

36:23.899 --> 36:24.848
How the hell
am I doing that?

36:24.900 --> 36:26.180
You think
I went after your money

36:26.201 --> 36:27.601
by changing the firm's
compensation structure.

36:27.636 --> 36:29.035
You did
come after my money!

36:29.088 --> 36:31.037
And now you're going after
Esther's to even the score.

36:31.073 --> 36:32.506
If I wanted
to even the score,

36:32.541 --> 36:33.924
I wouldn't come
after your sister.

36:33.976 --> 36:35.409
I'd be coming after you.

36:35.444 --> 36:37.477
And for your information,
I convinced her

36:37.513 --> 36:39.146
to be forgiving
by telling her

36:39.181 --> 36:40.447
that there are
some things in life

36:40.482 --> 36:41.748
that are more important
than money.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.483
Bullshit!
You don't believe that.

36:43.519 --> 36:46.019
Louis, I didn't take this
to get back at you.

36:46.054 --> 36:48.388
I took it because it was
a chance to bury the hatchet

36:48.424 --> 36:50.090
and move on.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.925
So either
let these terms stand,

36:51.927 --> 36:54.294
or do what you always do
and screw everything up.

37:03.071 --> 37:04.855
Robert,
I'm glad you're here--

37:04.907 --> 37:07.207
What the hell
did you do?

37:07.242 --> 37:09.042
What are you
talking about?

37:09.044 --> 37:10.444
I went to see
Emma Powell,

37:10.479 --> 37:12.112
but I swear to God, I did
not undermine the settlement.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.380
I'm not talking about that.

37:13.415 --> 37:16.283
I'm talking about you going
behind my back to Arcadian.

37:16.318 --> 37:17.617
I didn't do that.

37:17.653 --> 37:18.819
Oh, you expect me
to believe that

37:18.854 --> 37:20.420
after all the shit you told me
the last time I saw you?

37:20.456 --> 37:21.638
You can believe it or not,

37:21.673 --> 37:22.823
but I'm telling you
I didn't do anything.

37:22.858 --> 37:24.624
- Then who did?
- I did.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.694
You said if he colluded
with Arcadian,

37:27.729 --> 37:29.963
then we could shove a bigger
settlement down their throats.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.398
But he didn't
have to collude,

37:31.433 --> 37:34.301
because Arcadian already had
access to that settlement.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.069
Which makes it
insider trading anyway.

37:36.104 --> 37:37.270
And I pointed out to them

37:37.272 --> 37:39.206
that if they were
to divest their shares

37:39.241 --> 37:42.008
to our clients who don't
have insider knowledge,

37:42.044 --> 37:43.543
then they've done
nothing wrong.

37:43.579 --> 37:44.579
No harm done.

37:44.580 --> 37:46.346
The harm is
you lost me my client

37:46.381 --> 37:47.814
and made me look
like a fool.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.049
No, Robert, they did that

37:49.084 --> 37:50.450
by not telling you
what they did.

37:50.486 --> 37:51.852
Which means the client
you lost

37:51.887 --> 37:53.353
was breaking the law.

37:53.388 --> 37:54.838
And worse than that,

37:54.890 --> 37:56.056
they were lying
to their lawyer.

37:56.091 --> 37:57.257
So you think
this is funny?

37:57.292 --> 37:59.776
No, I don't.

37:59.812 --> 38:01.695
I think
your future son-in-law

38:01.730 --> 38:03.847
trusted you had nothing
to do with it

38:03.882 --> 38:06.500
and then saved your ass
from committing a crime.

38:06.535 --> 38:08.068
You're...welcome?

38:11.440 --> 38:14.207
Thank you.

38:14.243 --> 38:15.876
And you have
my condolences.

38:15.911 --> 38:17.677
- For what?
- For having to deal with him.

38:17.713 --> 38:20.046
Oh, you have no idea.

38:20.082 --> 38:22.232
Hey, right here.
I'm standing right here, guys.

38:22.267 --> 38:25.335
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Mm-hmm.

38:26.588 --> 38:29.122
If you guys, you know,
need anything fixed or saved

38:29.157 --> 38:31.958
that no one else seems to be
able to do, I'll be right here.

38:33.829 --> 38:34.928
Hey.

38:34.930 --> 38:37.430
Hey.

38:37.466 --> 38:41.051
What are you
doing here?

38:41.103 --> 38:43.603
I wanted to tell you
how grateful I am.

38:43.639 --> 38:45.672
- You don't need to do that.
- Yes.

38:45.707 --> 38:47.407
I do.

38:49.344 --> 38:51.711
This whole mess

38:51.747 --> 38:56.066
has been the hardest thing
I've ever gone through.

38:56.118 --> 38:57.558
And I wouldn't have
gotten through it

38:57.586 --> 39:00.020
without you reminding me
what's really important.

39:03.892 --> 39:06.393
Thank you for that.

39:06.428 --> 39:07.794
Take care, Harvey.

39:07.829 --> 39:10.230
Good luck, Esther.

39:12.968 --> 39:15.385
Oh, by the way,

39:15.420 --> 39:16.469
Louis wanted me
to tell you

39:16.521 --> 39:18.705
how grateful he is too.

39:36.158 --> 39:38.925
- Harvey.
- Louis.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.677
What can I do for you?

39:40.729 --> 39:42.178
Remember when I said,
if wanted you

39:42.230 --> 39:44.264
to make up
for the compensation vote,

39:44.299 --> 39:46.683
I would come
to you directly?

39:46.735 --> 39:47.834
Well, now I am.

39:47.869 --> 39:50.503
Well, what happened to

39:50.539 --> 39:53.006
"some things in life are
more important than money"?

39:53.041 --> 39:54.874
This isn't about the money.

39:54.910 --> 39:57.377
This is about
making things right.

40:01.783 --> 40:04.651
I'm sorry, Harvey.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.119
For what?

40:06.154 --> 40:07.704
I act like I don't know
Esther's beautiful,

40:07.739 --> 40:10.957
but I do.

40:10.993 --> 40:12.792
It started when we
were in junior high

40:12.828 --> 40:14.461
and all the cool kids
would hang out with me

40:14.496 --> 40:17.330
just so they could
get close to her.

40:17.382 --> 40:19.382
Sometimes it worked,
and sometimes it didn't,

40:19.418 --> 40:25.221
but either way,
when it was over...

40:25.257 --> 40:28.675
they all acted like
they didn't know me at all.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.929
So when I thought

40:32.981 --> 40:35.098
you were using her
to get to me, I, uh--

40:35.150 --> 40:38.101
I wasn't doing that, Louis.

40:38.153 --> 40:40.153
I know.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.241
I'll take care
of the compensation issue.
