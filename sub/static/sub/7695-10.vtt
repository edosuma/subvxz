WEBVTT

00:40.921 --> 00:42.002
( screaming )

00:42.002 --> 00:44.004
Guys, wake up!

00:44.004 --> 00:46.667
We did it!
We did it! We did it!

00:46.667 --> 00:47.838
We were sleeping!
We were sleeping!

00:47.838 --> 00:48.879
We were sleeping!

00:50.841 --> 00:52.843
Chase, it is 5:30
in the morning.

00:52.843 --> 00:54.014
What's going on?

00:54.014 --> 00:56.847
It took five years
but Mr. Davenport

00:56.847 --> 00:58.679
and I finally cracked it.

00:58.679 --> 01:00.681
We created
a new technology

01:00.681 --> 01:01.812
that's gonna revolutionize

01:01.812 --> 01:04.024
the way the world
gets its energy.

01:04.024 --> 01:06.066
( excited squeal )

01:06.066 --> 01:09.950
Did he just wake us up
to talk about science?

01:09.950 --> 01:11.652
I don't care
where you hit him,

01:11.652 --> 01:12.743
just make it hurt.

01:12.743 --> 01:13.864
Come on!

01:16.036 --> 01:18.909
Oh, you are so beautiful.

01:18.909 --> 01:20.040
Oh, yes you are.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.043
I love you, I love you,
I love you. I--

01:24.755 --> 01:28.008
Were you just talking
to a glass cube?

01:28.008 --> 01:29.800
No!

01:29.800 --> 01:32.763
I was talking to my
reflection in a glass cube.

01:34.715 --> 01:35.846
Here she is.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.679
The "DavenChase
Energy Transponder."

01:38.679 --> 01:41.142
That little thing
is what you two have been

01:41.142 --> 01:44.685
working on
for the past five years?

01:44.685 --> 01:47.938
Your genius is fading,
young Chase.

01:47.938 --> 01:49.990
Yeah, if you think
that's impressive,

01:49.990 --> 01:51.902
I've got a log cabin
made of popsicle sticks

01:51.902 --> 01:54.865
that will blow your mind.

01:55.996 --> 01:58.739
So, uh, what does it do?

01:58.739 --> 02:01.121
It's kind of like Leo's
energy-transference ability.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.953
It wirelessly harnesses energy

02:02.953 --> 02:05.666
from sources around it,
then stores it.

02:05.666 --> 02:07.748
So it's the ultimate
power source.

02:07.748 --> 02:09.008
Aw, cool!

02:09.008 --> 02:10.841
I've been looking
for a new phone charger.

02:10.841 --> 02:12.713
Crack her open
and juice me up.

02:12.713 --> 02:14.805
It's not a phone charger,
Adam.

02:14.805 --> 02:16.967
It's a billion-dollar piece
of technology.

02:16.967 --> 02:19.019
This little device packs
enough punch

02:19.019 --> 02:21.682
to power
an entire skyscraper.

02:21.682 --> 02:24.855
So what'll that give me, like,
15 hours of talk time?

02:27.728 --> 02:30.861
Right now, this is just
a one-of-a-kind prototype.

02:30.861 --> 02:35.075
But soon, the entire world
will run on my technology.

02:35.075 --> 02:39.830
Uh, I think you mean
 our technology?

02:39.830 --> 02:41.912
Yeah.
My technology.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.875
Here, let me show you
how it works.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.086
For security reasons,
we're keeping it

02:46.086 --> 02:47.788
in this impenetrable cube

02:47.788 --> 02:50.050
that can only be opened
with my retina scan.

02:57.007 --> 03:00.761
"Eye" am impressed.
( chuckles )

03:00.761 --> 03:04.014
Get it? 'Cause he has to use
the eye to open the thing.

03:04.014 --> 03:07.067
Oh, you're so--

03:07.067 --> 03:09.940
Careful, careful.

03:11.021 --> 03:12.733
Isn't it amazing?

03:12.733 --> 03:13.984
It's not doing any--

03:13.984 --> 03:16.817
It's harvesting energy!

03:16.817 --> 03:19.870
Yeah, sorry, but all
I see is a phone charger.

03:19.870 --> 03:22.703
Does it come with a cute,
little carrying case?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.745
Okay, Adam.

03:24.745 --> 03:25.826
Still think
it's a phone charger?

03:25.826 --> 03:27.037
Go ahead,
put your phone on there.

03:27.037 --> 03:28.919
Thank you.
Don't mind if I do.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.095
You still think
it's a phone charger?

03:35.095 --> 03:38.138
Nope, I'm just glad I tried it
on your phone instead of mine.

03:47.808 --> 03:50.020
All right, guys,
millions of people are online

03:50.020 --> 03:52.062
waiting for the global
webcast to start.

03:52.062 --> 03:54.735
Oh, this is so exciting.
How do we look?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.117
Like a couple of hit-men
from the "Mini Man Mob."

03:58.949 --> 04:00.861
Hey, wait.
What about the sign?

04:00.861 --> 04:02.823
Oh, right.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.870
Are you kidding me?

04:09.870 --> 04:12.002
I know, your name was
supposed to be much smaller.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.005
Great, so once again,
it's all about you.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.759
Chase, relax.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.930
I have no problem
sharing the spotlight.

04:20.930 --> 04:23.934
Guys, we're
on in three, two--

04:23.934 --> 04:25.806
You're in my light.
You're in my light.

04:27.728 --> 04:28.979
( grunting )

04:28.979 --> 04:31.652
How come I always
get stuck on laundry duty?

04:31.652 --> 04:33.944
You volunteered,
remember?

04:33.944 --> 04:37.988
So you could play your little
"Guess the Stain" game.

04:37.988 --> 04:38.989
Oh, yeah.

04:38.989 --> 04:40.781
Ooh,
this is a good one.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.864
( sniffs )

04:43.864 --> 04:45.826
Grape jelly and tuna.

04:45.826 --> 04:47.748
Healthy.
Must be Bob's.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.670
Hey, come on,

04:49.670 --> 04:50.831
let's go get ready
for training.

04:50.831 --> 04:52.963
Wait a minute,
I'm not done.

04:52.963 --> 04:57.798
Ugh. Whoa,
that smells horrible.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.879
But how does it taste?

04:58.879 --> 05:00.010
Adam!

05:06.016 --> 05:07.848
( audience cheering )

05:07.848 --> 05:09.930
Uh, Kaz?

05:09.930 --> 05:11.021
Where are we?

05:11.021 --> 05:12.643
You told me
we were going

05:12.643 --> 05:13.894
to a comic book festival
in Amsterdam!

05:13.894 --> 05:16.647
Have you ever been
to Amsterdam?
No.

05:16.647 --> 05:19.650
Then welcome
to Amsterdam.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.902
Look, man, I heard about
this Bionic Academy

05:21.902 --> 05:22.993
and I had to check it out.

05:22.993 --> 05:24.785
Bionic Academy?

05:24.785 --> 05:26.997
Yeah, this guy
Donald Davenport created it

05:26.997 --> 05:28.749
and there's like
a hundred kids

05:28.749 --> 05:30.831
with all different abilities
that train here.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.753
They're like high-tech
warriors.

05:32.753 --> 05:34.084
Great.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.667
'Cause that's the place
you want to break into.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.008
Come on, man.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.920
This could be the key
to me finally getting powers.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.011
All we have to do
is borrow

05:41.011 --> 05:42.843
whatever device
installs bionics

05:42.843 --> 05:44.014
and no one will ever know.

05:44.014 --> 05:45.676
If you keep this up,

05:45.676 --> 05:47.137
I'm gonna stop wormholing
with you.

05:49.139 --> 05:51.932
Quit worrying,
I got us covered.

05:53.814 --> 05:54.815
( sniffs ) Oh.

05:55.976 --> 05:57.738
Guess this academy

05:57.738 --> 05:59.940
doesn't train kids
to put on deodorant.

05:59.940 --> 06:01.982
( sniffs )
Ooh!

06:01.982 --> 06:05.786
Grape jelly and tuna.
Fancy.

06:08.949 --> 06:11.081
That presentation
went great.

06:11.081 --> 06:12.703
I didn't even get to talk.

06:12.703 --> 06:15.706
Like I said,
it went great.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.798
Let's just get started
on finding a company

06:17.798 --> 06:19.710
to mass produce
the transponders.

06:19.710 --> 06:20.921
I already did it.

06:20.921 --> 06:23.003
What?

06:23.003 --> 06:25.135
Yeah, soon
as the presentation was over

06:25.135 --> 06:27.007
I made one phone call,
deal was done.

06:27.007 --> 06:30.140
Why didn't you consult me?

06:30.140 --> 06:32.012
Because
if I consulted you,

06:32.012 --> 06:35.776
then I would have
to listen to your opinions.

06:35.776 --> 06:38.979
Well, did you at least go
with a company

06:38.979 --> 06:40.821
that's environmentally
conscious?

06:40.821 --> 06:43.824
I considered that
and many, many other factors

06:43.824 --> 06:45.115
and in the end,
I went with the guy

06:45.115 --> 06:46.116
who paid the most.

06:46.116 --> 06:47.908
Ka-ching!

06:54.745 --> 06:56.126
Yeah, I don't get it.

06:56.126 --> 06:58.879
These bionics have got to be
around here somewhere.

06:58.879 --> 07:00.921
Okay, let's say
you do get the bionics,

07:00.921 --> 07:02.132
what are you gonna do
with all that power?

07:02.132 --> 07:04.805
That is between me

07:04.805 --> 07:07.758
and the rest
of the weird bionic people.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.852
Hey!

07:11.852 --> 07:14.855
What are you two
doing here?

07:14.855 --> 07:15.936
You're supposed
to be training.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.648
Get with
the other students.

07:17.648 --> 07:19.109
All right, fall in.

07:19.109 --> 07:22.733
Yes we will...

07:22.733 --> 07:24.064
get with
the other students...

07:24.064 --> 07:27.067
because
we are students...

07:27.067 --> 07:28.659
of the island.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.952
Smooth.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.745
All right,
for todays combat exercise

07:34.745 --> 07:35.916
you'll be pairing up

07:35.916 --> 07:38.078
and fighting each other
using your bionics.

07:38.078 --> 07:39.670
Any questions?

07:39.670 --> 07:40.841
And I hope not

07:40.841 --> 07:41.922
because I can
pretty much guarantee

07:41.922 --> 07:43.794
I don't know the answer.

07:43.794 --> 07:47.087
Can we practice fighting
without bionics

07:47.087 --> 07:49.680
and also
without fighting?

07:49.680 --> 07:51.892
I would say yes

07:51.892 --> 07:53.934
but I'm afraid
no one would get hurt.

07:55.896 --> 07:58.058
Now, let's see
if we can find

07:58.058 --> 08:00.060
an even match
to pair with you.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.903
Ah, there we go.

08:04.695 --> 08:05.946
This shouldn't be too bad.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.870
( screams )

08:12.072 --> 08:14.745
If it's okay, I actually
already have a partner.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.077
And if it's not okay,
can he be her partner?

08:25.966 --> 08:28.719
Uh, excuse me.

08:28.719 --> 08:30.801
This is a restricted area.
Can I help you?

08:30.801 --> 08:32.803
I'm looking
for Mr. Davenport.

08:32.803 --> 08:33.974
I represent
a group of buyers

08:33.974 --> 08:34.975
and we'd like
to make an offer

08:34.975 --> 08:36.687
for his energy transponder.

08:36.687 --> 08:39.058
He's not here.

08:39.058 --> 08:42.062
And you're too late,
he already made a deal.

08:43.854 --> 08:47.067
Wait, I saw you standing
behind him on the webcast.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.780
Aren't you the other guy
that created the transponder?

08:49.780 --> 08:52.913
Well, I don't mean
to brag but, yes.

08:52.913 --> 08:56.917
I am Chase, the most
brilliant man in the world.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.660
Well, if you
don't mind me asking,

08:59.660 --> 09:00.921
who did he make
the deal with?

09:00.921 --> 09:02.833
I couldn't tell you.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.875
I was left out
of the negotiations.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.086
I don't know
if you noticed,

09:06.086 --> 09:08.128
but my father's
a bit of an egomaniac.

09:08.128 --> 09:12.012
I did notice that,
Lower Case Chase.

09:14.134 --> 09:16.807
Well, I guess
I'm wasting my time, kid.

09:16.807 --> 09:17.888
I'm used to dealing
with the people

09:17.888 --> 09:19.680
who make the decisions.

09:22.643 --> 09:23.684
Wait!

09:24.775 --> 09:25.946
I had just as much to do

09:25.946 --> 09:27.107
with the transponder
as he did.

09:27.107 --> 09:29.029
And the prototype
is still here...

09:29.029 --> 09:31.652
I'll double
whatever offer you have.

09:31.652 --> 09:32.953
I don't care about
the money.

09:32.953 --> 09:34.995
I just want
the transponders produced

09:34.995 --> 09:37.037
in an environmentally
friendly way.

09:37.037 --> 09:39.079
Of course!
That's our motto.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.912
Nature first...

09:41.912 --> 09:43.754
everything else second.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.797
So do we have a deal?

09:46.797 --> 09:49.760
You know what?

09:49.760 --> 09:52.843
Yes.
Yes, we do.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.886
And my dad
is going to kill me.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.101
There it is.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.102
Wow.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.775
It's beautiful.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.026
Yeah, I know.

10:06.026 --> 10:08.068
Who needs a girlfriend
when you got gadgets.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.864
I mean, it's very shiny.

10:17.077 --> 10:18.869
Um, by the way,

10:18.869 --> 10:21.041
I never caught your name.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.796
How rude of me.
It's--

10:27.127 --> 10:29.880
The Incapacitator.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.141
Great work, you two.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.064
When both students
are completely passed out,

10:44.064 --> 10:45.896
I know I've done my job.

10:47.728 --> 10:48.899
All right,
you guys are up next.

10:48.899 --> 10:49.980
What are your names
again?

10:49.980 --> 10:53.864
Francois Bouchon
De La Guerra.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.827
But you can call me Frank.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.780
And you are?

10:59.780 --> 11:02.042
Frank.

11:04.835 --> 11:07.047
All right, everybody,
it's Frank on Frank.

11:07.047 --> 11:08.668
Let's see what they got!

11:10.000 --> 11:11.051
What do we do?

11:12.672 --> 11:13.714
Follow my lead.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.675
( clears throat )

11:16.927 --> 11:19.970
( screaming )

11:19.970 --> 11:22.803
( both screaming )

11:22.803 --> 11:24.684
Make it stop,
make it stop!

11:24.684 --> 11:26.646
What are you doing
to him?

11:26.646 --> 11:29.730
I can attack other people's
brains with my brain.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.732
That's not a real ability.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.733
Yes, it is.

11:32.733 --> 11:33.904
Okay,
you convinced me.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.907
Frank,
what are you doing?

11:36.907 --> 11:38.739
Fight back.
What's your ability?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.911
I...
have the same ability.

11:40.911 --> 11:41.912
Seriously?

11:43.824 --> 11:48.749
( both screaming )

11:50.751 --> 11:52.002
Adam,
Chase was just attacked

11:52.002 --> 11:53.754
in the transponder room,
come on!

11:53.754 --> 11:55.095
Guys, I got to run.
Frank, you're in charge.

11:55.095 --> 11:57.007
Frank,
keep an eye on Frank.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.761
Chase!

12:00.761 --> 12:02.102
What happened?

12:02.102 --> 12:05.725
I was showing the transponder
to a potential buyer.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.768
You brought
a complete stranger in here?

12:07.768 --> 12:10.941
That guy blasted me
with some kind of energy force.

12:10.941 --> 12:12.813
Where's the transponder?

12:12.813 --> 12:14.905
He must have taken it.

12:14.905 --> 12:17.067
Great. Chase,
what were you thinking?

12:17.067 --> 12:20.030
Oh, I don't know,
maybe that you made a deal

12:20.030 --> 12:21.121
without me
so I was gonna make

12:21.121 --> 12:22.823
an even better
one without you?

12:22.823 --> 12:24.124
Well, if your deal was
to get knocked out

12:24.124 --> 12:26.706
and robbed,
you did a bang up job.

12:27.868 --> 12:29.920
We need to find
the guy who did this.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.792
It wasn't just some guy.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.924
That energy blast
wasn't human.

12:33.924 --> 12:35.085
Okay,
then what was he?

12:35.085 --> 12:36.797
Bionic?
An android?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.138
( gasps )

12:38.138 --> 12:41.051
What if he's an evil spirit
from a galaxy far away?

12:41.051 --> 12:43.723
We're no match
for a space ghost!

12:46.016 --> 12:47.808
So we don't know
who we're dealing with

12:47.808 --> 12:49.059
or what he's capable of.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.730
I'll contact the authorities.

12:50.730 --> 12:51.942
Get in your mission suits.

12:51.942 --> 12:54.734
This guy could still be
on the island.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.817
Until further notice,
everyone's on high alert.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.954
Hey, Franks.

13:05.906 --> 13:07.747
Howdy, Teach.

13:07.747 --> 13:10.080
Oh, hey, I've been
meaning to ask you,

13:10.080 --> 13:12.122
I know I have
all these bionics,

13:12.122 --> 13:14.835
but if I wanted
more of the bionics,

13:14.835 --> 13:16.917
where would I go
for that?

13:18.678 --> 13:20.881
Yeah, is there like
a room, a cubbie,

13:20.881 --> 13:23.723
maybe a bionic
vending machine?

13:25.015 --> 13:28.688
I wish, but no one
will listen to me.

13:31.892 --> 13:33.063
Adam.
Who are they?

13:33.063 --> 13:34.895
Oh, these are
our new students.

13:34.895 --> 13:40.820
Frank and, um, I forgot
the other guy's name.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.823
We don't have
any new students.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.867
We don't?
Wait a minute.

13:46.867 --> 13:47.998
( sniffs )

13:47.998 --> 13:49.870
A-ha!
I should've known.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.832
That's Bob's jelly
tuna shirt!

13:52.832 --> 13:54.834
Look, I--
I can explain everything.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.838
But Frank, you'd probably
do a better job so...

14:01.051 --> 14:02.842
Who are you guys?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.724
They're intruders.

14:04.724 --> 14:06.726
Too bad,
this one's kind of cute.

14:08.808 --> 14:10.850
As far as intruders go.

14:12.732 --> 14:15.105
I bet they're with the guy
who stole the transponder.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.106
Where is he?

14:16.106 --> 14:17.687
Where's the transponder?

14:17.687 --> 14:18.688
Transponder?
No, no, no.

14:18.688 --> 14:19.739
Kaz was just trying--

14:19.739 --> 14:20.820
Get 'em!

14:20.820 --> 14:21.861
TECTON:
Get away from them.

14:23.653 --> 14:24.945
Tecton!

14:24.945 --> 14:28.038
Gray Granite,
Gamma Girl.

14:28.038 --> 14:31.831
Guys,
a surprise costume party?

14:31.831 --> 14:33.083
It's not
even my birthday.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.917
What's going on?

14:36.917 --> 14:38.128
I don't know.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.000
We've been tracking
the Incapacitator.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.003
His infrared
energy trail led us here.

14:43.003 --> 14:45.805
( chuckles )

14:45.805 --> 14:47.717
Look, Superboy,

14:47.717 --> 14:49.889
I don't know what movie
theater your mom thought

14:49.889 --> 14:51.891
she was
dropping you off at,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.103
but you're
in the wrong place.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.018
He's got
energy transference.

14:58.018 --> 14:59.689
Just like
the Incapacitator.

15:01.861 --> 15:04.114
Oh, yeah?
Two can play that game.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.829
Yeah, he definitely
did not get that

15:09.829 --> 15:11.741
out of a vending machine.

15:14.124 --> 15:15.795
I don't know
who this guy is,

15:15.795 --> 15:17.837
but he's a major threat.

15:17.837 --> 15:20.750
Just have everyone
at the FBI be on lookout.

15:22.752 --> 15:24.714
You're the guy
who attacked Chase.

15:24.714 --> 15:26.716
They call me
the Incapacitator.

15:26.716 --> 15:28.048
Really?

15:28.048 --> 15:29.889
Is that like on your driver's
license and everything?

15:31.721 --> 15:33.053
What do you want
with my transponder?

15:33.053 --> 15:35.105
Right now, I can touch
any power source

15:35.105 --> 15:37.647
and transfer the energy
into my body.

15:37.647 --> 15:39.939
The problem is,
that energy runs out.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.901
Well,
have you tried juices?

15:41.901 --> 15:43.943
I mean, there's
this great kiwi, kale blend

15:43.943 --> 15:45.735
or seaweed and berries.

15:45.735 --> 15:47.067
You know,
pineapple, mint--

15:47.067 --> 15:49.029
Okay.

15:52.122 --> 15:53.663
Since you've created
a way for me

15:53.663 --> 15:55.665
to obtain energy wirelessly,

15:55.665 --> 15:57.957
I can continuously absorb it
from everything around me

15:57.957 --> 16:00.000
and never have to recharge.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.923
Well, thanks for explaining
how my own technology works.

16:03.923 --> 16:05.845
What do you think
you're gonna do with it?

16:05.845 --> 16:08.798
I'm going to drain the entire
planet of all its energy,

16:08.798 --> 16:11.851
and become the most
powerful being in the world.

16:11.851 --> 16:14.684
Open this case.
Now.

16:14.684 --> 16:15.855
Never.

16:15.855 --> 16:17.647
That's an
impenetrable polymer

16:17.647 --> 16:20.730
and the only way into that
case is using my retina scan.

16:21.901 --> 16:24.814
I mean, there is no way
to get in that case!

16:26.026 --> 16:27.067
I don't suppose
you're gonna give me

16:27.067 --> 16:28.658
a running head start,
are you?

16:30.950 --> 16:33.823
( grunting )

16:47.677 --> 16:49.759
Hey, crater face,

16:49.759 --> 16:51.051
this one's for you.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.730
Did you see that?

17:00.730 --> 17:02.902
Yeah, you won't see
that in Amsterdam!

17:02.902 --> 17:04.904
Oh, no, okay,

17:04.904 --> 17:07.067
I left the wormhole
transporter in my pants.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.778
Okay, I'll come with you
but please,

17:08.778 --> 17:10.029
don't ever say that again.

17:26.925 --> 17:28.127
Adam, a little help!

17:54.904 --> 17:57.036
Let's see how tough you are
without your little stick.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.912
All right,
that's pretty tough.

18:06.666 --> 18:09.088
( groans )

18:09.088 --> 18:11.841
Okay...

18:13.923 --> 18:15.014
Guys! Help!

18:16.676 --> 18:17.677
Big D!

18:17.677 --> 18:18.928
Get up here, quick!

18:18.928 --> 18:20.019
Who is that?

18:20.019 --> 18:21.100
Our father.

18:23.683 --> 18:24.894
Who's that?

18:24.894 --> 18:26.816
That's the guy
who stole the transponder.

18:26.816 --> 18:29.068
That's the Incapacitator.

18:29.068 --> 18:30.990
Wait, you guys
don't work for him?

18:30.990 --> 18:32.652
No.

18:32.652 --> 18:33.863
But I am looking
for a weekend gig.

18:33.863 --> 18:34.904
Is he hiring?

18:36.736 --> 18:38.037
The Incapacitator
is a villain.

18:38.037 --> 18:41.000
That's who these guys
came to take down.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.083
Oh, right.
Bionic heroes, superheroes.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.875
Superheroes, bionic heroes.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.667
I probably
should have done that

18:47.667 --> 18:49.749
before the battle
but I am so glad I didn't.

18:50.920 --> 18:54.053
Wait, so you guys
are real superheroes?

18:56.015 --> 18:58.718
Like the ones
in the comic books?

18:58.718 --> 19:00.810
And on my lunch box?

19:01.971 --> 19:03.973
Which I no longer use.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.728
Bro, that is so cool!

19:08.728 --> 19:11.731
It must be an honor
for you to meet me.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.112
You, too?

19:13.112 --> 19:15.655
Yeah.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.946
Just so you know,

19:16.946 --> 19:18.988
I totally would've helped you
if I could have.

19:18.988 --> 19:21.080
It's okay,
you're still cute.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.832
Who me?
 Yes, you.

19:22.832 --> 19:24.784
Your little red shirt,
you're so adorable.

19:24.784 --> 19:26.085
Let's go, lover girl!

19:27.957 --> 19:29.879
We have to go help
Mr. Davenport.

19:33.092 --> 19:34.133
No.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.925
What are you doing?

19:35.925 --> 19:38.968
Making
my own retina scan.

19:40.139 --> 19:43.142
( groans )

19:52.942 --> 19:55.024
You'll never get away
with this.

19:58.658 --> 20:00.660
Don't move,
Incapacitator.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.031
Who are they?

20:02.031 --> 20:04.874
They're superheroes!

20:06.125 --> 20:07.877
You're too late,
Tecton.

20:07.877 --> 20:09.749
I already have
what I need to make you

20:09.749 --> 20:12.962
and the entire world
bow down at my feet.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.801
Take him down.

20:35.945 --> 20:37.777
That's it.

20:37.777 --> 20:40.740
I got us into this mess,
I'm gonna get us out.

20:42.662 --> 20:44.123
No, Chase.
He's too powerful.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.077
( grunting )

20:49.709 --> 20:50.960
Chase!

20:52.081 --> 20:53.793
With this transponder,

20:53.793 --> 20:55.965
my energy
will continue to grow.

20:55.965 --> 20:57.086
I've already taken down

20:57.086 --> 21:00.970
one of your
so-called bionic heroes.

21:00.970 --> 21:02.722
Just imagine
what I'm going to do

21:02.722 --> 21:03.883
to the rest of the world.

21:03.883 --> 21:06.145
( evil laugh )

21:08.097 --> 21:10.099
He's still alive
but he's fading.

21:10.099 --> 21:11.651
What do we do?

21:11.651 --> 21:13.022
I don't know.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.854
He's fried Chase's
entire bionic infrastructure.

21:14.854 --> 21:16.986
I don't think I have
the equipment here to save him.

21:16.986 --> 21:19.899
Don't worry.
We can.

21:19.899 --> 21:20.990
What?

21:20.990 --> 21:22.662
I'm Kaz and this is Oliver

21:22.662 --> 21:23.743
and we work at a place
called Mighty Med.

21:23.743 --> 21:25.745
It's a hospital
for superheroes.

21:25.745 --> 21:27.957
We deal with this kind
of stuff all the time.

21:27.957 --> 21:29.829
We can save him.

21:29.829 --> 21:31.671
Big D,
we barely know them.

21:31.671 --> 21:32.962
Are you really
considering this?

21:32.962 --> 21:35.795
Trust me, we save
heroes' lives every day.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.007
I promise you,
he'll be fine.

21:38.007 --> 21:40.049
Mr. Davenport,
what do we do?

21:40.049 --> 21:41.881
Go.
I'm not gonna risk his life.

21:41.881 --> 21:43.763
I'll stay here
and get the word out about

21:43.763 --> 21:44.974
the Incapacitator.

21:47.687 --> 21:49.138
Okay, well, how are we gonna
get him there?

21:49.138 --> 21:50.850
Through a wormhole.

21:50.850 --> 21:52.772
Look I know
we're friends

21:52.772 --> 21:55.775
but is now really the time
to make fun of Chase's size?

21:57.897 --> 21:59.739
I don't care
what you have to do.

21:59.739 --> 22:00.940
Save my son.

22:11.911 --> 22:13.122
Welcome to Mighty Med,

22:13.122 --> 22:14.914
the world's best
superhero hospital.

22:14.914 --> 22:16.916
First I get to travel
through a wormhole

22:16.916 --> 22:19.008
and now I'm
in a superhero hospital.

22:19.008 --> 22:20.840
This is the best day ever!

22:20.840 --> 22:22.672
If you don't count
the part

22:22.672 --> 22:24.053
where our brother got blasted
and is about to die.

22:24.053 --> 22:27.847
Wow, you really know
how to ruin a guy's day.

22:28.928 --> 22:30.770
Here,
put him over here.

22:33.893 --> 22:36.896
Horace, Chase was blasted
by the Incapacitator.

22:36.896 --> 22:38.648
He needs immediate
medical attention!

22:38.648 --> 22:40.820
Oh, no!
Not Chase!

22:40.820 --> 22:41.901
This is terrible!

22:41.901 --> 22:44.033
Who's Chase?

22:44.033 --> 22:45.905
Him.

22:47.747 --> 22:50.039
Nice to meet you.

22:50.039 --> 22:51.701
He's not very friendly,
is he?

22:52.952 --> 22:55.915
So, what type
of superhero is Chase,

22:55.915 --> 22:58.087
other than
an impolite one?

22:58.087 --> 22:59.999
No, no,
he's not a superhero.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.761
He's a human
with a bionic chip that

23:01.761 --> 23:03.092
gives him super-abilities.

23:03.092 --> 23:04.964
Except for the ability
to say hello.

23:04.964 --> 23:07.887
Chase,
you're embarrassing us.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.680
What's going on?
Who are these people?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.812
I'll explain later,
but the short version is--

23:12.812 --> 23:14.774
Bionic-arm,
super-strength,

23:14.774 --> 23:16.976
super-fast
and super-unconscious.

23:18.688 --> 23:19.689
Can you help him?

23:19.689 --> 23:20.820
Don't worry,

23:20.820 --> 23:22.782
I have everything
under control.

23:22.782 --> 23:23.903
Chase will be
perfectly fine.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.867
Kaz, Oliver,
come with me.

23:27.867 --> 23:29.699
I have a conference
to attend,

23:29.699 --> 23:31.030
but I'll brief you
on what to do next.

23:31.030 --> 23:33.663
Horace, I'm so relieved
you know how to cure Chase.

23:33.663 --> 23:34.954
Oh, me, too.

23:34.954 --> 23:36.916
But there
is one minor issue.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.798
I don't know
how to cure Chase.

23:39.839 --> 23:41.961
What?

23:41.961 --> 23:43.963
I'm sorry,
but I've never seen

23:43.963 --> 23:45.805
bio-technology
like that before.

23:45.805 --> 23:47.046
Then why'd you say
you could cure him?

23:47.046 --> 23:48.758
Oh, it's just
so much easier than

23:48.758 --> 23:50.890
telling people
you can't cure them.

23:50.890 --> 23:53.142
Good news,
I can cure you.

24:01.110 --> 24:02.982
This is bad.

24:02.982 --> 24:04.734
We insisted
we bring Chase here.

24:04.734 --> 24:05.905
We promised
he'd be fine.

24:05.905 --> 24:06.906
Okay, if Horace
can't cure him,

24:06.906 --> 24:08.828
we'll just--

24:08.828 --> 24:09.909
we'll just have to figure out
a way to do it ourselves.

24:09.909 --> 24:11.070
In the meantime,

24:11.070 --> 24:12.832
just pretend
everything's fine.

24:12.832 --> 24:13.873
Act confident.
 Okay.

24:13.873 --> 24:15.074
( clears throat )

24:17.997 --> 24:19.078
Wow.

24:19.078 --> 24:22.001
These guys seem
really confident.

24:23.713 --> 24:24.844
Thank you
for bringing us here

24:24.844 --> 24:25.885
and finding
a cure for Chase.

24:25.885 --> 24:27.847
I have to admit,
I had my doubts.

24:27.847 --> 24:29.929
Well, I never doubted Oliver
for a second.

24:29.929 --> 24:31.090
He has such
a trustworthy face,

24:31.090 --> 24:32.091
just look at it.

24:36.015 --> 24:37.937
This orange is really sour.

24:39.058 --> 24:40.980
Aw!

24:40.980 --> 24:44.694
Look at his weird,
cute, twisted face.

24:45.905 --> 24:48.658
Mm,
what's with that?

24:48.658 --> 24:49.949
Oh, she has a crush
on Oliver.

24:49.949 --> 24:51.781
I'll explain later.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.784
Although, there really
is no logical explanation.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.998
Listen, we need
to stop the Incapacitator,

24:58.998 --> 25:00.670
how long till Chase
is good to go?

25:00.670 --> 25:03.713
Eh, you know, uh,

25:03.713 --> 25:06.836
I really wouldn't wait
around for Chase.

25:06.836 --> 25:08.888
Yeah, I think some of us
should focus on

25:08.888 --> 25:10.009
stopping
the Incapacitator

25:10.009 --> 25:11.050
and some of us
should stay here

25:11.050 --> 25:13.683
with Chase,
who will be fine.

25:13.683 --> 25:16.726
I'm fully confident.

25:16.726 --> 25:20.640
Well, you do look
confident, so, okay.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.852
All right, Leo, you and Kaz
stay behind with Chase.

25:22.852 --> 25:28.027
And I'll go with Oliver,
because he...is...cute.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.069
So...are...you.

25:30.069 --> 25:34.654
I'll...come...too.

25:34.654 --> 25:35.955
Okay.

25:35.955 --> 25:37.787
Skylar will go
with you guys,

25:37.787 --> 25:39.959
and Adam
will stay with us.

25:39.959 --> 25:42.121
Oh, cool.
What's this thing do?

25:42.121 --> 25:43.793
Oh, that's
a reflex hammer.

25:43.793 --> 25:44.924
Oh.

25:44.924 --> 25:45.925
( groans )

25:47.837 --> 25:51.130
Wow,
he's got great reflexes.

25:53.052 --> 25:56.766
Okay, new plan.
Adam's on your team.

26:04.644 --> 26:06.986
So, aren't you going to do
something to help Chase?

26:06.986 --> 26:10.650
Yeah, uh, I just have
to give him a urine test.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.864
Chase, "you're in"
what hospital right now?

26:17.867 --> 26:19.869
He's failed his urine test.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.703
You have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

26:25.705 --> 26:27.757
Before I answer
that question,

26:27.757 --> 26:30.049
do you have
any bionic ability to tell

26:30.049 --> 26:32.922
when someone's lying?
No.

26:32.922 --> 26:34.884
Then I know exactly
what I'm doing.

26:36.716 --> 26:37.927
You're lying.

26:37.927 --> 26:40.890
So you do have
a bionic lie-detecting ability!

26:41.891 --> 26:45.064
No.
I'm just not stupid.

26:45.064 --> 26:48.067
Chase needs help now.

26:48.067 --> 26:49.899
But the only person smart
enough to figure out

26:49.899 --> 26:52.942
how to cure Chase
is Chase.

26:52.942 --> 26:54.824
Hold on a second.

26:54.824 --> 26:55.905
You just gave me an idea.

26:56.946 --> 27:00.039
This is a neuro-physiolomogra--

27:00.039 --> 27:03.002
physiologigra--

27:03.002 --> 27:05.915
It's a brain-switching machine.

27:05.915 --> 27:10.920
We also use it
to slice deli meat.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.013
You're gonna transfer
Chase's brain into yours,

27:14.013 --> 27:17.887
cure Chase,
then make a sandwich?

27:17.887 --> 27:19.969
Because I'm starving.

27:19.969 --> 27:21.681
No, I'm not taking
his entire brain,

27:21.681 --> 27:22.682
just his...

27:22.682 --> 27:24.894
cojnativ--
congative--

27:24.894 --> 27:27.066
his smarty bits.

27:29.068 --> 27:32.071
( whirring )

27:37.777 --> 27:39.658
Did it work?

27:39.658 --> 27:40.910
The only way
to know conclusively

27:40.910 --> 27:42.661
would have been
if we'd measured my baseline

27:42.661 --> 27:44.954
intelligence level
before the transfer.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.916
But based on my use
of the phrase

27:46.916 --> 27:48.087
"baseline intelligence level,"

27:48.087 --> 27:50.669
yeah,
I'd say it worked.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.882
So now
you can cure Chase?

27:52.882 --> 27:55.925
Yes,
but more importantly...

27:57.096 --> 27:59.719
Turkey or roast beef?

27:59.719 --> 28:04.063
Dude!
Obviously roast beef.

28:07.767 --> 28:09.068
Okay, okay,
I think I've figured out

28:09.068 --> 28:10.770
how to find out
where the Incapacitator is.

28:10.770 --> 28:11.811
Me, too.

28:11.811 --> 28:13.072
We just have
to dress him up

28:13.072 --> 28:15.024
in these red and white
stripes and glasses

28:15.024 --> 28:18.697
and tell him to go
to a crowded beach.

28:18.697 --> 28:22.992
Okay,
while you're doing that,

28:22.992 --> 28:25.034
I'll go find Ambrose,
our comic book artist.

28:25.034 --> 28:27.126
His visions allow him to see
superheroes and villains

28:27.126 --> 28:28.878
and draw their location,

28:28.878 --> 28:30.709
he even sees them
when they're sleeping.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.133
He's like Santa except
creepier and less jolly.

28:35.674 --> 28:37.006
Okay, in the meantime,

28:37.006 --> 28:38.968
I'll recruit some
superheroes to help us out.

28:38.968 --> 28:42.141
Thanks, but that's not
really necessary.

28:42.141 --> 28:43.973
Adam and I are here.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.936
Yes, I know, but technically
you're not superheroes.

28:46.936 --> 28:50.850
You're more like
super-impressive appliances.

28:53.022 --> 28:54.854
Anyway,
we can get the Crusher.

28:54.854 --> 28:56.986
He's the strongest man
in the universe.

28:56.986 --> 28:59.028
Show 'em, Crusher.

29:04.914 --> 29:08.828
Not bad, but Adam is easily
as strong as that.

29:08.828 --> 29:09.829
Show them, Adam.

29:21.841 --> 29:25.935
Well, I guess
the Crusher's not coming.

29:25.935 --> 29:29.058
Hey, dude, you're using
those weights wrong.

29:36.986 --> 29:38.657
Have you figured
out the problem?

29:38.657 --> 29:40.069
Yes.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.741
This sandwich needs
more mayonnaise.

29:44.073 --> 29:47.746
Also, it seems that
Chase's chip was destabilized

29:47.746 --> 29:49.748
by an excess
of negative ionization.

29:49.748 --> 29:51.911
But we should be
able to cure him

29:51.911 --> 29:54.713
with a positive
electrostatic pulse.

29:55.875 --> 29:58.757
Okay.
Stand back.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.682
( gasps )

30:03.682 --> 30:06.055
You did it.
It worked!

30:06.055 --> 30:09.018
This sandwich is much better
with mayonnaise!

30:10.729 --> 30:12.932
Oh,
and Chase is cured.

30:12.932 --> 30:16.695
Check me out,
I'm a rooster!

30:20.069 --> 30:22.992
What is wrong
with me?

30:22.992 --> 30:24.944
You were badly injured

30:24.944 --> 30:26.655
so we had
to temporarily switch

30:26.655 --> 30:27.997
your intelligence
with Kaz's,

30:27.997 --> 30:29.828
so he could figure out
how to cure you.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.002
I have Kaz's intelligence?

30:33.002 --> 30:36.045
But I don't want to be...
what's the word?

30:36.045 --> 30:38.087
I can't think
of the word!

30:38.087 --> 30:40.009
My thinking place hurts!

30:40.009 --> 30:41.670
( beeping )

30:41.670 --> 30:42.761
What's happening?

30:46.765 --> 30:47.846
Chase's injury
has created

30:47.846 --> 30:49.678
a hardware virus
in his chip.

30:49.678 --> 30:52.061
It's causing the chip
to generate protonic energy.

30:52.061 --> 30:53.893
He's stable for now,

30:53.893 --> 30:56.976
but if his blood pressure
gets too high, he'll explode.

30:56.976 --> 30:58.938
We cannot
let him know that,

30:58.938 --> 31:01.820
or his blood pressure
will skyrocket.

31:01.820 --> 31:02.821
We need
to keep him calm.

31:02.821 --> 31:03.822
( alarm sounding )

31:03.822 --> 31:04.863
( screaming )

31:04.863 --> 31:06.865
Hey! Hey!

31:06.865 --> 31:08.077
Is that an alarm?

31:08.077 --> 31:10.829
Are we under attack?
What's going on?

31:10.829 --> 31:12.751
Don't worry,
it's only a drill.

31:12.751 --> 31:13.872
A drill for what?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.664
To test how panicky
everyone gets

31:15.664 --> 31:17.997
when I set off
a terrifyingly loud alarm.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.920
You passed the test.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.841
You also passed
the urine test.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.053
"You're in"
a state of panic.

31:24.053 --> 31:26.765
( panting )

31:30.769 --> 31:32.061
Okay, I got Ambrose
to draw

31:32.061 --> 31:33.892
the location
of the Incapacitator.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.014
I also got him to draw

31:35.014 --> 31:36.725
this caricature
of the four of us.

31:38.107 --> 31:39.898
That looks nothing
like me.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.900
My ears are nowhere
near that small.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.692
That's Skylar.

31:43.692 --> 31:45.074
Oh.

31:45.074 --> 31:47.947
Ew.

31:52.741 --> 31:55.664
Anyway,
where's the Incapacitator?

31:55.664 --> 31:57.666
According to this,
he's at the Eiffel Tower.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.958
We need to stop him.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.000
We can use the wormhole
transporter to get to Paris.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.711
Whoa,
we're going to Paris?

32:02.711 --> 32:03.842
Booyah!

32:07.006 --> 32:09.718
Uh, that broke.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.682
Okay,
everyone ready?

32:13.682 --> 32:14.723
Huddle up.

32:28.117 --> 32:30.909
Where's
the Incapacitator?

32:30.909 --> 32:32.121
Wait.

32:32.121 --> 32:33.742
Look in the background.

32:33.742 --> 32:35.034
There's
the Statue of Liberty.

32:35.034 --> 32:37.836
And the Great Pyramid.
And King Arthur's castle.

32:37.836 --> 32:40.839
The Incapacitator isn't
at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

32:40.839 --> 32:42.791
He's at the replica of it
in Las Vegas.

32:42.791 --> 32:46.135
Man, no wonder
they call this the Awful Tower.

32:46.135 --> 32:50.969
It's pronounced Eiffel.
E-I-F-F-E-L.

32:50.969 --> 32:54.683
I'm pretty sure
you just spelled "falafel."

32:55.894 --> 32:57.646
Okay, no problem.

32:57.646 --> 32:59.058
We'll just use
the wormhole transporter.

32:59.058 --> 33:00.939
It'll get us to Vegas
in a matter of seconds.

33:00.939 --> 33:02.861
Whoa,
we're going to Vegas?

33:02.861 --> 33:04.063
Booyah!

33:09.818 --> 33:11.660
This is awful!

33:11.660 --> 33:13.742
I believe
it's pronounced "falafel."

33:20.669 --> 33:22.041
I can't believe you lost
the wormhole transporter.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.922
Now how are we supposed
to go to Las Vegas

33:23.922 --> 33:25.124
and stop
the Incapacitator?

33:29.758 --> 33:31.009
Where did you get that?

33:31.009 --> 33:34.763
At a street fair.
In Tel Aviv.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.728
All this talk about
falafel made me want one.

33:39.728 --> 33:41.770
Ooh, I also got
a mini license plate

33:41.770 --> 33:44.903
with my name on it.

33:44.903 --> 33:46.905
Bree, that's it!
Your super-speed!

33:46.905 --> 33:48.817
You can use it to carry
all of us to Las Vegas!

33:48.817 --> 33:50.028
Ooh, good idea!

33:50.028 --> 33:51.860
But because
we're going over water,

33:51.860 --> 33:53.912
I can't carry all three
of you at the same time.

33:53.912 --> 33:55.114
Can you take one of us,

33:55.114 --> 33:56.915
and then run back
and get the other two?

33:56.915 --> 34:00.038
I could do that.
And I'll take Oliver first.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.920
I have a better idea.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.713
You take Adam first,
and I'll wait here with Oliver.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.717
So you can stay
alone with Oliver

34:08.717 --> 34:10.668
in the most romantic city
on earth while I'm gone?

34:10.668 --> 34:11.719
No thanks.

34:13.672 --> 34:14.973
Well, I don't care
when I go,

34:14.973 --> 34:16.054
just as long
as I'm not staying

34:16.054 --> 34:17.096
anywhere by myself.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.056
I get lonely.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.021
Okay, stop.

34:23.021 --> 34:26.063
This is getting ridiculous.
And weird.

34:29.027 --> 34:31.860
Besides, I think
I have a solution.

34:39.998 --> 34:42.701
Ah!
A jellyfish!

34:42.701 --> 34:44.002
Oh, man.

34:44.002 --> 34:46.083
If we had a peanut
butter fish, we'll be set.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.888
Hey, buddy.

35:01.890 --> 35:02.981
I know being
in a strange place

35:02.981 --> 35:04.102
can make you tense,

35:04.102 --> 35:06.645
so I brought you
some herbal tea.

35:06.645 --> 35:08.727
And I thought
it would help to listen

35:08.727 --> 35:10.989
to some relaxing
whale songs.

35:10.989 --> 35:17.696
( imitating whale sounds )

35:17.696 --> 35:19.828
Stop!

35:19.828 --> 35:22.080
I didn't even get
to the chorus.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.663
( chimes )

35:24.663 --> 35:26.084
I just got a text
from Adam.

35:26.084 --> 35:27.836
Those guys are
on their way to fight

35:27.836 --> 35:29.087
the Incapacitator
in Las Vegas.

35:29.087 --> 35:30.669
We have
to go help them.

35:30.669 --> 35:31.840
No.
We can't!

35:31.840 --> 35:33.011
Fighting is stressful,

35:33.011 --> 35:35.013
and you can't be
stressed out right now.

35:35.013 --> 35:36.675
Adam and Bree
are in danger,

35:36.675 --> 35:37.756
and I'm going
to go help them.

35:42.681 --> 35:43.642
Now what?

35:43.642 --> 35:45.974
Okay, uh--
you go find Chase

35:45.974 --> 35:47.976
and I'll get
the invisible ambulance

35:47.976 --> 35:49.067
to take us
to Las Vegas.

35:49.067 --> 35:51.069
But it might take
a while.

35:51.069 --> 35:52.821
I forgot where it's parked.

35:52.821 --> 35:54.653
And it's invisible.

35:56.985 --> 35:58.907
( crash )

36:00.989 --> 36:03.081
Oh, good.
You found it.

36:11.129 --> 36:13.051
Ugh.

36:13.051 --> 36:16.134
Wow, I am spent.

36:16.134 --> 36:18.757
When did running
6,000 miles across mountain,

36:18.757 --> 36:22.060
ocean and desert
become so exhausting?

36:22.060 --> 36:24.723
Adam might have made things
worse by dragging

36:24.723 --> 36:26.975
that giant tuna
the last 5,000 miles.

36:33.071 --> 36:34.863
People come to Vegas
for many reasons.

36:34.863 --> 36:37.115
I guess you came
to be incapacitated.

36:37.115 --> 36:39.698
And for the buffet.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.950
Adam, blast wave!
Now!

36:43.662 --> 36:46.665
( grunting )

36:46.665 --> 36:48.667
The Incapacitator's
absorbing his energy!

36:52.751 --> 36:55.003
And now, with
the Davenport Transponder,

36:55.003 --> 36:57.756
I can absorb
all the power in the world,

36:57.756 --> 36:59.968
and plunge the earth
into darkness.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.692
Give it up, Incapacitator.

37:13.692 --> 37:15.734
You're totally
outnumbered.

37:22.911 --> 37:24.703
Technically
you're still outnumbered,

37:24.703 --> 37:26.955
so my statement holds up.

37:31.039 --> 37:35.834
( grunting )

37:40.879 --> 37:47.766
( grunting )

38:00.819 --> 38:02.070
( grunting )

38:10.999 --> 38:12.751
Look out!

38:12.751 --> 38:15.914
( grunting )

38:21.920 --> 38:23.922
Goodbye, Skylar Storm.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.975
Hello, Incapacitator.

38:26.975 --> 38:29.097
( grunts )

38:31.640 --> 38:32.931
( ambulance alarm beeps )

38:32.931 --> 38:36.735
( grunting )

38:36.735 --> 38:37.986
Kaz, you cured Chase.

38:37.986 --> 38:40.989
Uh, not really.
He's going to blow up.

38:44.743 --> 38:46.114
( roars )

38:46.114 --> 38:47.906
He has a hardware virus

38:47.906 --> 38:49.748
that's building up energy
in his bionic chip.

38:49.748 --> 38:52.911
If his blood pressure
gets too high, he'll explode.

38:52.911 --> 38:54.663
Wait a second.

38:54.663 --> 38:56.084
If Chase has a hardware virus,
those can be--

38:56.084 --> 38:57.876
Transferred
from one device to another!

38:57.876 --> 38:59.668
I'm way ahead of you.

38:59.668 --> 39:01.760
I'm super-smart now.
I'll explain later.

39:02.921 --> 39:06.054
( grunting )

39:06.054 --> 39:09.137
I hope you're all ready
to be destroyed.

39:09.137 --> 39:11.059
I have a plan.
Chase, jump off the tower.

39:11.059 --> 39:14.773
Do you maybe have
a different plan?

39:14.773 --> 39:15.894
You have protonic energy

39:15.894 --> 39:17.776
building up
in your bionic chip.

39:17.776 --> 39:20.108
You can't let him absorb it,
or he'll be unstoppable!

39:20.108 --> 39:22.741
He has protonic energy
in him?

39:22.741 --> 39:25.073
I'll take that,
thank you very much.

39:25.073 --> 39:27.075
( groans )

39:29.077 --> 39:30.659
What's he doing to Chase?

39:32.791 --> 39:34.122
Chase is fine.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.955
All the Incapacitator
did was remove the virus.

39:36.955 --> 39:39.087
Virus?
What virus?

39:39.087 --> 39:40.839
You know, the one that
makes you explode

39:40.839 --> 39:43.051
if your blood pressure
gets excessively high.

39:43.051 --> 39:46.004
Like if you realize that
some kid in high school

39:46.004 --> 39:49.057
just tricked you
and ruined your entire plan.

39:49.057 --> 39:50.098
What?!

39:51.139 --> 39:52.851
Yeah, like that.
Everybody duck!

39:54.723 --> 39:58.937
( roaring )

40:10.869 --> 40:11.870
You did it!

40:11.870 --> 40:13.081
It worked!

40:13.081 --> 40:14.793
Did you ever doubt me?

40:14.793 --> 40:18.747
Yeah, ever since
the urine test.

40:20.038 --> 40:23.001
Wait, Adam's missing!
Where's Adam?

40:28.717 --> 40:29.808
There he is.

40:29.808 --> 40:34.012
Oh, man.
I'm falafel at hiding.

40:38.817 --> 40:41.730
( whirring )

40:41.730 --> 40:43.111
Did it work?

40:43.111 --> 40:45.824
Please tell me our intelligence
switched back, please!

40:46.865 --> 40:48.026
( laughs )

40:48.026 --> 40:50.869
Check it out,
I'm a dairy cow.

40:54.072 --> 40:56.995
It worked.

40:56.995 --> 40:59.878
Oliver,
Kaz, congratulations.

40:59.878 --> 41:00.919
Well done.

41:00.919 --> 41:02.841
See?

41:02.841 --> 41:05.083
That's how you respond
to an offer of a handshake.

41:05.083 --> 41:06.885
Not like this.

41:09.928 --> 41:12.090
Hey, Skylar.

41:12.090 --> 41:18.056
Listen, I am really sorry
for underestimating you.

41:18.056 --> 41:23.061
Superheroes are pretty great,
with or without powers.

41:23.061 --> 41:25.063
I'm sorry, too.

41:25.063 --> 41:27.816
I guess it's not important
if you're bionic,

41:27.816 --> 41:29.067
or have superpowers,

41:29.067 --> 41:31.990
or are completely
unspecial like Kaz.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.993
( laughs )

41:36.074 --> 41:37.786
Anyone can be a hero.

41:39.918 --> 41:42.961
Oliver,
I'm going to miss you.

41:42.961 --> 41:44.883
You're so smart
and kind.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.676
And you remind me
of someone,

41:47.676 --> 41:49.087
but I just can't think
of who.

41:49.087 --> 41:52.010
Oh, is it Thomas
the Tank Engine?

41:52.010 --> 41:54.092
I get that a lot.

41:54.092 --> 41:57.896
I mean, personality-wise.
I'm not a train.

41:57.896 --> 42:01.980
No, it's not
a make-believe train.

42:01.980 --> 42:03.732
It's someone I know...

42:03.732 --> 42:06.775
He reminds me of Chase.
Your brother.

42:06.775 --> 42:09.027
Yes! Chase!

42:09.027 --> 42:10.779
You remind me
of Chase!

42:11.910 --> 42:13.702
You remind me
of Chase, ew!

42:16.915 --> 42:18.917
Hey,
what was that about?

42:18.917 --> 42:20.078
I thought
you didn't like Oliver.

42:21.710 --> 42:23.962
Maybe I like him
more than I realized.

42:32.010 --> 42:34.803
I'm over it.

42:35.844 --> 42:37.055
Bye, guys!

42:37.055 --> 42:38.937
Sorry for breaking
so much of your stuff.

42:41.770 --> 42:44.062
The doors open automatically.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.815
Not anymore.

42:54.903 --> 42:56.074
Where'd your friends go?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.696
Oh, they left.

42:57.696 --> 42:59.748
Without saying goodbye?

42:59.748 --> 43:02.000
What, were they raised
in a basement?
