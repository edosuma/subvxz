00:00.001 --> 00:03.335
<i>- Previously on
"The Magicians"...</i>

00:03.337 --> 00:05.070
<i>- My hands won't cast.</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:07.206
- We can help you, penny.
- What's the catch?

00:07.208 --> 00:08.407
"Bound in service to the library

00:08.409 --> 00:10.509
up to and after my death"?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.078
<i>- That isn't just any door.
- Then what is it?</i>

00:13.080 --> 00:14.179
- The poison room.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.447
There is knowledge
behind that door

00:15.449 --> 00:17.216
that could destroy
more than just people.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.417
It could destroy worlds.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.219
<i>- "The ars deicidium"?</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:22.087
<i>- "The art of killing gods."</i>

00:22.089 --> 00:24.423
- King Idri is our
honored guest.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.758
<i>We're getting married.</i>

00:25.760 --> 00:28.360
One big, royal
polyamorous family.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.462
- The fairies can bring back
the wellspring?

00:30.464 --> 00:31.463
- They can.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.232
- And in return?

00:33.234 --> 00:35.200
<i>- The child that grows
in the womb</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:37.036
<i>of the high king's wife.</i>

00:37.038 --> 00:39.772
<i>- Some friends
and I summoned a goddess.</i>

00:39.774 --> 00:42.374
- You may address me
as Reynard the fox,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.276
<i>trickster of the very stupid.</i>

00:44.278 --> 00:46.812
<i>- Reynard's son is John Gaines?</i>

00:46.814 --> 00:48.447
<i>- My son...</i>

00:50.283 --> 00:52.384
<i>- Jules, I talked to your shade.</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:53.552
She's not gone.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.220
- So where is she?

00:55.222 --> 00:57.256
- Shades go to the underworld.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.158
The living can access
the underworld

00:59.160 --> 01:00.325
with the help of a gatekeeper.

01:00.327 --> 01:04.196
- I think I figured out
what an ancient one is.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.571
- Look, Q, you don't have to
come with me.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.474
In fact,
I don't think that you should.

01:15.476 --> 01:18.444
- Noted, but I'm coming.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.846
You feel the energy
coming off that?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.549
- Yeah, also the stink.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.822
- I don't know, my ancient Greek
is a little rusty.

01:29.824 --> 01:32.357
- "The old reveals itself
to the new

01:32.359 --> 01:35.561
at the fall of milk teeth."

01:35.563 --> 01:37.596
Milk teeth?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.431
- Oh, baby teeth.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.867
You think we have to
stick one in to open it up?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.435
- I mean, I could write a spell.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.105
Uh, we could find
the nearest child's house

01:46.107 --> 01:47.306
expecting the tooth fairy and...

01:47.308 --> 01:49.875
- break in
and steal their teeth?

01:49.877 --> 01:52.377
- I'd leave money.

01:53.646 --> 01:55.481
- Uh, I hate to bring this up,
but I actually...

01:55.483 --> 01:57.182
I still have one...

01:57.184 --> 01:58.450
A molar that never came in.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.519
- Oh,
I know an extraction spell.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.553
- Ah!

02:01.555 --> 02:03.522
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

02:06.559 --> 02:08.660
- This dragon better be
fucking cool.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.470
- Hmm...

02:18.472 --> 02:20.639
Or not.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.458
- I wouldn't have guessed
baby teeth.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.927
Why would a dragon want
baby teeth?

02:41.929 --> 02:45.664
- Shit.
<i>- I collect baby teeth.</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:48.267
<i>As I collect many things,
little mammal.</i>

02:53.507 --> 02:55.741
- uh, greetings, your ladyship.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.676
<i>- "Your ladyship"?</i>

02:57.678 --> 03:00.679
<i>I am a queen of the great worms.</i>

03:00.681 --> 03:02.648
- Of course you are.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.284
Uh, that's awesome... I wasn't
suggesting that you weren't.

03:05.286 --> 03:08.220
<i>- Your manner does not endear
me to you, human.</i>

03:11.658 --> 03:14.726
- We seek passage to the
underworld, oh ancient one.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.232
<i>- Hmm.
- You seek to die.</i>

03:20.234 --> 03:24.436
- Uh, no, actually, we were
hoping to come back after.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.505
<i>- Suit yourself.</i>

03:26.507 --> 03:28.574
I require a gift.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.276
- A gift?
- Um...

03:31.278 --> 03:32.644
Yeah, I mean, name it,

03:32.646 --> 03:34.613
and we'll get it for you.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.716
- You already have it.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.285
It's in your pocket.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.229
- No.
- Pick something else.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.231
- No, if it gets you
your shade back...

03:52.233 --> 03:53.665
- no.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.567
Fillory is your home.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.369
And what about your friends?
What if they need you?

03:57.371 --> 03:59.304
We can't.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.509
- Queen of the great worms.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.645
What if I, uh,
needed to borrow it

04:06.647 --> 04:08.647
in the future,
just super briefly?

04:08.649 --> 04:10.015
<i>- No.</i>

04:10.017 --> 04:11.717
If you wish to return home,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.752
you must find other means.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.522
<i>The first door remains open,
little mammal.</i>

04:17.524 --> 04:21.793
- Great, um,
I super love riddles.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.303
- Are you giving me
the button or not?

04:40.313 --> 04:43.649
- Your bodies will stay here,
and your souls will travel.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.018
You have 24 hours
to return to the portal.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.619
- Or?

04:47.621 --> 04:51.023
- I sit patiently,
waiting for you to come back.

04:51.025 --> 04:54.760
No, I eat you... I'm a fucking
dragon, what do you expect?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.461
- Great, good to know.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.298
- Then it's settled.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.372
- Jesus,
a little warning next time.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.541
- Really.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.678
Q, look.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.446
<i>- Time to go.</i>

05:17.517 --> 05:19.651
Fucking millennials.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.477
- Welcome to the underworld.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.815
Please take a number.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.555
- The fuck?

06:11.904 --> 06:13.905
- Idri is almost here.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.109
And does anyone know
where fen is?

06:21.681 --> 06:24.716
- I present king Idri of Loria.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.956
- My life is perfect.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.591
Hello.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.593
Josh... wine, canapÃ©s.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.428
I said have it ready.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.930
- We have a lovely blend of...

06:38.932 --> 06:40.432
<i>Ahem. Okay.</i>

06:40.434 --> 06:41.600
- And where are
the fire dancers?

06:41.602 --> 06:44.736
I don't know.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.471
I'm sorry,
I had a whole thing...

06:46.473 --> 06:47.939
- your majesty,
this presentation

06:47.941 --> 06:50.976
is beautiful, but...

06:50.978 --> 06:53.478
- It would be so much better
with fire dancers, I know.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.881
- I hope my arrival isn't
causing undue stress.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.783
- Stress?

06:57.785 --> 07:00.786
- I'm not stressed...
- Eliot.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.855
- I don't care about ceremony.
- You don't?

07:03.857 --> 07:07.459
- But...
- but I came here for you.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.996
- Oh.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.964
Well...

07:12.966 --> 07:16.501
The feeling's mutual.

07:16.503 --> 07:21.006
- Take me somewhere we can
become a bit better acquainted.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.041
Alone.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.914
- Congratulations, you're dead.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.651
You've passed through the veil
to the underworld.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.519
<i>Is this your final destination?</i>

07:34.521 --> 07:35.887
<i>No.</i>

07:35.889 --> 07:37.923
<i>It's the first leg
of your journey.</i>

07:37.925 --> 07:41.226
<i>We designed this part
of the underworld for you,</i>

07:41.228 --> 07:43.728
<i>based on your life
and personal expectations</i>

07:43.730 --> 07:46.798
<i>to facilitate a comfortable
transition.</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:50.669
<i>You've been grouped with others
who have similar expectations.</i>

07:50.671 --> 07:51.903
<i>Perfect, right?</i>

07:51.905 --> 07:55.207
- Ow.
- What?

07:55.209 --> 07:57.976
<i>- Settle into this
next stage of your existence.</i>

07:57.978 --> 08:00.545
<i>In the unlikely event
you're missing your shade,</i>

08:00.547 --> 08:02.948
<i>please report to
a bellhop immediately.</i>

08:02.950 --> 08:05.050
<i>Enjoy your wait.</i>

08:08.788 --> 08:10.522
- I guess we need to
find a bellhop.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.923
<i>- Security,
we have a shade-less patron!</i>

08:11.925 --> 08:13.592
<i>- What?
- Hey!</i>

08:13.594 --> 08:14.860
- Take him away.
- Why? Where are you taking me?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.995
- Thank you, thank you.
- Read me my rights!

08:16.997 --> 08:19.498
Hey, let go!
Wait, ow!

08:19.500 --> 08:21.933
- Or, you know, we take a beat.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.768
- 173.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.072
- I'm 173.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.607
- Place your hands
on the counter

08:28.609 --> 08:30.876
for identification, please.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.881
- Hey, do you know where they
were taking that guy just now?

08:36.884 --> 08:40.652
- Oh, his soul is missing
a little piece.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.886
They just took him
somewhere where

08:41.889 --> 08:43.722
he would be more comfortable.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.056
- So he could be
reunited with it?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.958
- I doubt it, that's very
difficult to do.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.528
Especially after
a prolonged separation.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.729
- Yeah,
but you can't just take...

08:50.731 --> 08:52.097
- I assure you, all the shades

08:52.099 --> 08:55.600
are safe and well protected
for their eternity.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.602
Nothing to worry over.

08:57.604 --> 08:58.770
Ah, here we are.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.740
Wicker and Coldwater.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.608
Oh.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.876
Oh, my.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.851
- What?
- You've both died 39 times.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.687
Aha... time loop.
Thought so.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.123
Our computers do not
handle these well.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.026
This will take a bit
to sort out.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.961
Once you're in the system,
we'll reunite you

09:22.963 --> 09:24.629
with your immediate
karmic circle,

09:24.631 --> 09:26.631
but until then, I'll need to
stick you somewhere.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.966
Do you like skiing?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.901
- Look, I thought
this was just a waystation.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.037
- We're kind of in a hurry...
- oh, it is.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.839
But souls do stay a while,

09:34.841 --> 09:37.576
until they're ready to...

09:37.578 --> 09:38.910
Move on.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.979
Snorkeling?
Art museums?

09:40.981 --> 09:43.915
- Actually, is it possible
to check on a few names?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.952
I think I might have
a karmic circle we could visit.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.696
- You're making progress.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.863
- Am I?

09:58.865 --> 10:00.966
Nothing's happening.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.835
- It's an exceedingly
difficult way to do magic.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.938
Trying to isolate muscles not
generally associated with...

10:06.940 --> 10:08.873
- call it what it is.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.742
Sphincter magic.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.143
Gets me there, no shame.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.712
- And if it doesn't,

10:13.714 --> 10:15.880
we all need
a healthy pelvic floor.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.782
Now, I'm afraid
study time is over.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.718
I have your next job.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.354
- Re-shelving books.
- Great.

10:22.356 --> 10:24.789
- Any questions,
direct them to...

10:24.791 --> 10:25.924
Where'd she go?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.726
- Sylvia!
<i>- What?</i>

10:27.728 --> 10:29.060
- Shh!

10:33.199 --> 10:37.102
Penny, Sylvia.
Sylvia, penny.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.970
- So what, I'm babysitting now?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.105
- Oh, no.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.840
Sylvia is your supervisor.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.009
Good luck, I'll check back.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.114
- Nice scarf.

10:51.384 --> 10:55.687
- Anyway, I married fen
because I had to.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.923
But I didn't know her at all.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.660
And now...

11:01.662 --> 11:04.796
I don't know you.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.431
- My wife used to say,
there's one way

11:06.433 --> 11:10.235
to learn to be with
another person.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.404
- The hard way?

11:12.406 --> 11:15.140
- Actually, yes.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.908
Stand up.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.116
Would you mind removing this?

11:32.858 --> 11:34.959
Buttons, too, please.

11:37.129 --> 11:40.165
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.868
This is a lesson.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.072
All of them.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.473
Please.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.813
- I really hate
to bring this up,

11:54.815 --> 11:58.249
but you do realize there's
nothing we can actually do.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.118
- Oh, I know.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.189
And yet,
there's so much we can do.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.827
I can't touch you,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.196
you can't touch me,

12:11.198 --> 12:14.833
but I can tell you
how I want to touch you.

12:14.835 --> 12:18.903
And you can show me
how you like to be touched.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.906
- I admire your
commitment to education.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.878
If you're waiting for
my permission, don't.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.024
What the fuck?

12:41.762 --> 12:43.895
Eliot, Heloise just
turned into a rat!

12:45.899 --> 12:47.065
Who is that?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.035
- I'm not getting laid
tonight, am I?

12:54.473 --> 12:57.208
- This is all of them?
- We can't be sure.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.777
So many people have vanished

12:58.779 --> 13:00.912
and there are so many rats
in the castle already.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.815
Well, one of 'em has to be fen.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.917
Okay, bottom line it for me.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.252
What the fuck is going on?

13:07.254 --> 13:08.787
- I'm sorry, your highness.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.889
But this magic,
I've never seen it before.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.259
- Abigail?
- If you can hear me, squeak.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.994
Let me know you're okay.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.831
Why didn't I study
how to speak rat in school?

13:21.233 --> 13:23.001
- Okay, search the castle.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.202
Find every rat.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.904
And then council meeting.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.506
Or what's left of the council.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.361
- What do we call that?

13:50.363 --> 13:52.030
- Mm...

13:52.032 --> 13:54.966
In-sex-tion?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.535
- Inter-cepti-course?

13:57.537 --> 14:00.572
Incepti-sex.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.941
"Incepti-sex."

14:02.943 --> 14:05.210
I like that.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.346
That said,
I like real life better.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.582
- Mm.

14:10.584 --> 14:14.319
- But at least this way, we
don't have to get up for beers.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.958
- Thank you.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.898
- So, no pressure,

14:26.900 --> 14:29.400
but...

14:29.402 --> 14:30.902
Any word on the poison room?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.337
- Believe me,
I want to get in there.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.972
It's... it's above my pay grade.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.007
I need a code to get in.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.642
- Well, what about
that librarian?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.377
- Oh, man, if she has the code,

14:39.379 --> 14:41.279
it is locked down tighter
than a nun's pussy.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.281
- Right, of course it is.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.985
Hey, does she have
a book of her?

14:46.987 --> 14:49.988
- Everyone has a book.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.055
You're thinking...

14:51.057 --> 14:53.658
- If the room
is that important...

14:53.660 --> 14:56.094
- it's in her book.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.528
Okay.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.564
I can work on that.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.666
Hey, what's up with the senator?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.101
- He went back to work.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.602
He made up some bullshit excuse

15:04.604 --> 15:06.004
about the kidnapping.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.006
All the news outlets bought it.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.674
But hey, get this...

15:09.676 --> 15:12.410
I saw Reynard in the back of
a press photo.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.946
In a suit,
like an advisor or something.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.981
- Are you kidding me?

15:16.983 --> 15:19.350
- He's a trickster.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.019
Guess that includes his own son.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.420
- Jesus Christ.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.657
- We can't get one more vote?

15:25.659 --> 15:27.926
- We're in touch with
Matthews, Bauer, Wheeler.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.295
Just give 'em a couple of days,
they'll come to their senses.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.629
- Call in senator Cowden.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.431
- Why bother?
- He won't budge.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.633
- We can change his mind.
- Trust me.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.002
- How?

15:38.004 --> 15:40.138
- Everyone, give us a minute.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.579
- So they're taking
your orders now?

15:48.581 --> 15:49.948
- Have been for a while.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.050
I controlled their minds.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.019
Just like you have,
many, many times.

15:55.021 --> 15:56.587
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.623
- You know you have that power.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.326
You've been using it
your whole life.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.662
- I always thought
I had some kind of...

16:04.664 --> 16:08.333
God-level good luck.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.069
- True, you've only used it
instinctively,

16:11.071 --> 16:12.704
but I'm here now.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.706
I can teach you
how to use it at will.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.541
Easy.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.643
And once you've mastered it,

16:18.645 --> 16:21.412
that's how you get
Cowden's vote.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.747
- I don't know that
I want to do that.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.683
- It feels like cheating.
- They all don't cheat?

16:25.685 --> 16:27.986
Everyone uses whatever
they've got, John,

16:27.988 --> 16:30.088
and the bad ones don't hesitate.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.489
So someone like you,

16:31.491 --> 16:33.424
someone who wants to do some

16:33.426 --> 16:35.493
actual good in the world,

16:35.495 --> 16:38.496
how can you not?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.565
Here's all you have to do.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.600
Look at me.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.505
You look him
straight in the eye,

16:47.507 --> 16:50.208
and you tell him, plainly.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.610
Directly.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.013
- That's it?

16:55.015 --> 16:58.182
- It's that simple.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.018
Good luck with the meeting,
senator.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.198
- Why would anyone
want their afterlife

17:14.200 --> 17:16.701
to look like a terrible
middle school birthday party?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.435
- Is this about your "incident"?

17:18.438 --> 17:20.405
- I moved on.
- Have you?

17:20.406 --> 17:21.806
- Julia?
- Julia!

17:21.808 --> 17:23.808
- Julia!
- Oh, welcome!

17:23.810 --> 17:26.176
Welcome!

17:26.179 --> 17:27.712
- Where's bender?
- Is he okay?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.480
- He's great.
- He moved on.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.183
- Uh, who's your friend,
and what's his shoe size?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.252
- Uh, we're not really
here to bowl.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.154
- Kid, the first rule
of being dead,

17:36.156 --> 17:38.189
if you're here, ya bowl.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.690
- We're actually not dead,
either.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.125
Uh, we're here because
we need your help.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.794
<i>- Julia?</i>

17:49.768 --> 17:52.270
What?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.704
- Nothing.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.706
It's... it's good to see you,
Richard.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.176
- I mean, the real you.
- The real me?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.511
What happened?

18:00.513 --> 18:01.679
- I need your help.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.748
I need to find my shade.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.516
- Okay.

18:08.153 --> 18:11.189
- The underworld is massive.
- There's every ecosystem.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.357
Nearest we can tell,
about 2,000 islands

18:13.359 --> 18:15.159
built to look like Hawaii.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.394
- And you went with
a bowling alley?

18:16.396 --> 18:17.395
- Fuck yeah.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.629
- And the powers that be

18:18.631 --> 18:21.099
are into whatever
helps us settle in

18:21.101 --> 18:22.600
so that we can move on.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.602
- Ow, yeah!
- Whoo!

18:24.604 --> 18:27.171
- "Powers that be"?
- Yeah. Gods.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.639
We were right about
them being real.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.374
Hades created the underworld,

18:30.376 --> 18:31.742
runs it with his wife,
Persephone.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.512
They live in a big house
way over here.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.215
It's a beautiful area
called Elysium.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.383
- Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork

18:39.385 --> 18:41.686
every fall and spring,
but a while back,

18:41.688 --> 18:43.321
they just disappeared.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.390
- Wait, why are you
doing all this, Richard?

18:46.392 --> 18:48.659
I know you.
This is a project.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.561
- I'm trying to find my son.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.297
I don't know where he is,
if he's even still here.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.732
But he's got to be somewhere.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.535
And they won't tell me
a damn thing.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.770
- Why not?

18:59.772 --> 19:03.274
- I'm flagged as culpable
in his death.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.675
There are rules.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.145
And friends to help me
break them.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.249
- Okay, so wait, so where
do they keep the shades?

19:11.251 --> 19:12.583
- Sorry, we don't know that yet.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.152
- So we're flying blind?

19:14.154 --> 19:16.420
- Hun,
you're gonna have to bowl.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.356
- No, look, I had an incident
when I was a kid.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.224
- My fingers got stuck in the...
- oh, get over it.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.526
Your girl would.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.561
- She's not my girl.
- No shit.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.263
She's tough as granite.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.365
And you're afraid to bowl.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.432
- Fine.

19:33.572 --> 19:37.308
- How long before the dragon
eats you and Quentin?

19:37.310 --> 19:39.210
- Tomorrow morning.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.478
- Always the one
to tell the impossible

19:40.480 --> 19:41.712
to go fuck itself, huh?

19:41.714 --> 19:45.483
- Yeah, well,
it doesn't always listen.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.585
- They'll know where the shades
are kept at reception.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.720
- I don't know,
they didn't seem too keen

19:49.722 --> 19:52.356
on helping out a person
who looked like this.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.426
Shit, it seems to be closing up

19:55.428 --> 19:57.495
much faster down here.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.263
- Okay, so we hurry.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.232
But just... not for nothing,
reception isn't keen

20:01.234 --> 20:03.668
to help much of anyone... I can't
count the number of times

20:03.670 --> 20:07.772
I've been kicked out of there,
trying to find my little boy.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.575
- I have an idea.
- Oh, my god, Julia!

20:10.577 --> 20:12.577
I... I got a strike.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.578
- Whoo!

20:13.580 --> 20:15.479
Yeah, q!

20:15.481 --> 20:17.515
- The thing about the
underworld is, the first week,

20:17.517 --> 20:19.417
it's always a strike.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.355
- Let him have this one.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.257
Whoo!
Go, q!

20:26.259 --> 20:27.358
Ow!

20:33.533 --> 20:37.368
- You wanted to talk?
- You lying son of a bitch.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.871
You turned fen into a rat,
along with half the castle.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.807
- Fen is in her human form,

20:42.809 --> 20:44.709
in the fairy realm.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.377
And she was taken
because you tried to

20:46.379 --> 20:47.645
get clever with our deal.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.848
- So you turned half my staff
into snake food?

20:50.850 --> 20:53.384
- That wasn't the fairies.
- Oh.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.687
Well, it sure smells like
their whimsical bullshit.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.258
- "Whimsical."

21:00.260 --> 21:01.826
It's the mark of the stupid
and the arrogant

21:01.828 --> 21:04.262
to attack what you can't
comprehend.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.763
- Fine.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.598
Get it out of your system.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.734
Then if you know
what's going on,

21:09.736 --> 21:11.802
just tell me.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.771
- I take it back.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.275
You're not entirely
simple-minded.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.576
There's another power,

21:18.578 --> 21:20.645
which you made the mistake
of overlooking.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.680
- You want to be specific,
or not?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.715
- A power without logic.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.886
A power that acts, not for gain,
but solely because it can.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.622
That's the true danger.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.424
Face that.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.793
Or face the end of your kingdom.

21:45.437 --> 21:47.338
- Uh, hey.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.341
- I got a question for you.
- Of course.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.343
How can I help?

21:52.345 --> 21:55.680
- You know,
I never got your name.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.582
- You may call me
head librarian.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.552
And, uh...

22:01.554 --> 22:04.555
What do I get to call you
outside of work?

22:04.557 --> 22:06.624
- I see what you're getting at.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.527
But interoffice courtship
is expressly prohibited.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.729
I'm flattered,
but rules are rule.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.597
- Are they?

22:13.599 --> 22:16.701
Always?

22:16.703 --> 22:19.503
- Penny, please don't
take it personally,

22:19.505 --> 22:22.373
but you're not my type.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.608
You're a touch
emotionally insecure,

22:24.610 --> 22:27.545
for which you compensate heavily
with boisterousness

22:27.547 --> 22:29.914
and foul language.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.949
I'm here if you need
anything else.

22:45.630 --> 22:47.765
- Hey, guys.
- Mr. Corrigan.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.667
Uh, Mr. Corrigan, you have
no need to be in here.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.901
- Just a couple of questions.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.837
- I'm gonna take a number.
- Please, sir.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.905
- Um, you know what, I'm gonna
take a couple of numbers,

22:54.907 --> 22:57.408
just in case I don't...
I don't hear the first number.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.776
<i>Yeah, wow, you guys got
a lot of numbers.</i>

22:58.778 --> 23:00.511
- Mr. Corrigan,
I beseech you.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.380
- Oh, no, does this thing
run out of numbers?

23:02.382 --> 23:03.981
- There we go.
- Playtime's over, Mr. Corrigan.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.783
<i>- I'm not playing,
I really have questions.</i>

23:05.785 --> 23:07.518
<i>- Quite the jokester you are.
- That is it.</i>

23:07.520 --> 23:09.787
- Security!
- Don't call security, Thomas.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.655
- Security!
- Oh, no, security.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.557
<i>- They're on their way.
- No, no, no.</i>

23:13.559 --> 23:15.526
<i>- I'm just getting a number here.
- Ha ha, very funny.</i>

23:15.528 --> 23:17.528
<i>- Does this thing
run out of numbers?</i>

23:17.530 --> 23:18.996
- It's locked.

23:18.998 --> 23:22.400
<i>Security!</i>

23:22.402 --> 23:23.934
- "Disconnected shade."
- Where?

23:23.936 --> 23:25.403
- It doesn't say.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.839
Just says "E."

23:28.841 --> 23:30.841
Another one,
"disconnected shade, 'E.'"

23:30.843 --> 23:33.878
- wait, if they all say "E"...

23:33.880 --> 23:35.913
- Elysium.
- Yes.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.983
- Okay, great, it's the complete
opposite end of the underworld.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.685
- Take him away for
disciplinary processing.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.020
- Thank you.
- There's no need, guys.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.855
Okay, you got me.

23:44.857 --> 23:48.559
- Hope you had some fun to make
your confinement worthwhile.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.694
- Oh, what's a few weeks
out of eternity?

23:58.571 --> 24:00.971
- This is books for school kids.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.506
- If it's so important,

24:02.508 --> 24:04.942
finding me that five mil
can't be too hard.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.710
- I'm not adding
another amendment.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.879
- You invited me in.

24:08.881 --> 24:11.482
You knew what you were
getting into.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.451
- Right.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.829
You're going to support
this bill.

24:24.831 --> 24:28.032
In fact, your yes will be
the first vote cast.

24:31.938 --> 24:35.539
- John, this bill should've
been passed a long time ago.

24:35.541 --> 24:38.709
And I'm sorry for trying to
drag you into the ditch on this.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.545
You have my vote.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.747
- Then I thank you
for your help.

24:45.684 --> 24:46.817
You all right?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.922
- Let me get you some water.

24:51.924 --> 24:55.025
- I... I must've
stood up too fast.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.895
Here you go.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.597
I... I need to make a...

24:59.599 --> 25:00.898
- Becca!

25:00.900 --> 25:03.667
Becca, get the doctor.
Get the doctor now!

25:06.137 --> 25:09.039
- John, I'm sorry,
. But...

25:09.041 --> 25:11.108
I think you're overestimating
yourself, here.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.545
- No, honey,
I'm being 100% literal.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.213
I am not human, Cindy.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.716
And I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it is true.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.217
- Okay...

25:20.219 --> 25:22.219
I think that you have
been working too hard...

25:22.221 --> 25:23.254
- no, I haven't.

25:23.256 --> 25:26.156
I haven't.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.992
I am telling you the truth.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.593
Because you are the one I trust.

25:29.595 --> 25:32.696
You are the only one, really.

25:32.698 --> 25:36.166
And I really just need
your support right now, babe.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.604
- Of course, honey.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.607
I apologize.

25:43.609 --> 25:46.277
I know that you always find
a way to do the right thing,

25:46.279 --> 25:48.145
and I am here for you.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.780
Whatever you need.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.286
Now come on.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.054
Let's go home.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.217
- It's like a shade orphanage.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.319
- We should hurry.

26:28.321 --> 26:29.587
We're running out of time.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.221
We should split up.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.190
- I kind of have a thing about
splitting up in houses

26:33.192 --> 26:34.892
full of creepy kids.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.136
Hey, can we ask you a question?

26:46.138 --> 26:48.272
- Sure.
- What was that?

26:48.274 --> 26:49.840
That you just did
with the money?

26:49.842 --> 26:52.343
- For the little boy?

26:52.345 --> 26:53.677
- What little boy?

26:53.679 --> 26:55.713
- The little boy
with the shitty dad.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.914
He ran away.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.649
And now he's cold and hungry.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.818
He'll find it on the sidewalk
any minute.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.155
- And that...

27:05.157 --> 27:06.824
- She's in a hospital room.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.626
She's making them bloom.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.362
It's a really obvious miracle,
but that's okay.

27:11.364 --> 27:13.697
The girl in the room
is gonna die anyways.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.633
- So you're all making miracles.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.801
- Just little tiny ones, though.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.236
- Cool.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.206
Um, we were looking for a shade.

27:22.208 --> 27:26.310
- Her name's Julia.
- Yeah, uh, she looks like her.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.178
Kind of.
Um, and...

27:28.180 --> 27:30.114
- well, she's a...
- She's a mess.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.383
- We all were when we got here.

27:32.385 --> 27:33.717
Anything else?

27:33.719 --> 27:35.819
- Um, she's brave.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.355
And funny,
and she probably made friends

27:38.357 --> 27:41.258
with some of the most shy,
maladjusted shades.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.662
She's curious, and she won't
take no for an answer.

27:45.864 --> 27:48.666
- Are you looking for
the kind of new one,

27:48.668 --> 27:51.168
who's always getting in trouble
and sneaking into

27:51.170 --> 27:52.903
Ms. Persephone's room...
Because, you know,

27:52.905 --> 27:54.705
we're never supposed to
go in there.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.942
Yeah.
Yeah, that does sound like her.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.679
- I just saw her.
- This way.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.350
Up those stairs.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.252
Last door.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.423
- Eugene?
- Yeah?

28:12.425 --> 28:14.158
- Who's that?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.459
- That's Ms. Persephone.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.795
She hasn't been here
for a really long time

28:17.797 --> 28:19.329
and no one knows where she is.

28:21.767 --> 28:24.034
- Thank you so much
for all your help.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.775
That's our lady underground.

28:31.777 --> 28:33.277
- What?

28:33.279 --> 28:35.245
The one that you...

28:42.254 --> 28:45.789
- so you were real
all along, huh?

28:45.791 --> 28:48.025
Just completely awol.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.728
Self-centered bitch.

28:53.466 --> 28:57.034
We were so stupid to love you.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.969
<i>- Jules...</i>

28:58.971 --> 29:01.271
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

29:01.273 --> 29:05.242
Look, I'm glad I know.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.010
It's always better to know, q.

29:07.012 --> 29:08.912
You keep watch.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.347
I'll sneak in
and find the part of me

29:10.349 --> 29:11.949
that already snuck in.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.884
Hmm.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.258
- We're under attack.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.895
The rattening, now reports of
upside down rain.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.865
- Correct... as well as ant hills
turning into volcanoes,

29:27.867 --> 29:30.367
the balmy sea turning to acid,

29:30.369 --> 29:33.504
and the mysterious disappearance
of all blondes

29:33.506 --> 29:35.472
in the province of
Crickety Cove.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.976
- The talking animals report
this includes palomino horses.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.845
Also, every chicken in Fillory
has laryngitis.

29:41.847 --> 29:45.082
- Is there a pattern
to any of this?

29:45.084 --> 29:46.550
- None that we can tell.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.952
Only that whatever it is,
it is increasing.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.922
- Idri's turned into a rat,
so it isn't the Lorians.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.391
We've incapacitated
the fu fighters.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.059
That leaves...

29:56.061 --> 29:57.995
The people in this room.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.566
- Your highness?

30:02.568 --> 30:04.802
- If anyone has anything
to say...

30:04.804 --> 30:06.570
- I'm embezzling funds
from the royal treasury.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.472
- Why did I just say that?
- Hah!

30:08.474 --> 30:11.842
Because there's truth serum
in this wine.

30:11.844 --> 30:15.546
I've truthied you.
Anyone else?

30:15.548 --> 30:18.549
- Abigail and I have been using
the castle guards

30:18.551 --> 30:20.017
to run an escort service.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.585
- Gross.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.287
But clever.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.422
Doesn't help us.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.990
Should've made this stronger.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.428
- It was me.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.603
I made a deal with the fairies
and I know where fen is.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.979
- You got to be kidding me.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.948
- It's not your break.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.354
- So what?
- You, uh... you gonna report me?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.857
- Answer a question,
maybe I'll forget to.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.160
- What's your question?

31:03.162 --> 31:04.895
- You trying to fuck that
librarian?

31:04.897 --> 31:05.996
- No!

31:05.998 --> 31:07.865
- I saw you.
- You want to fuck her.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.099
You want to
lick her butthole, huh?

31:09.101 --> 31:10.634
- Whoa, Jesus, no!

31:10.636 --> 31:12.603
- Then why are you
scamming her so hard

31:12.605 --> 31:15.505
that I nearly blew you?

31:15.507 --> 31:17.140
- I just need her name, okay?

31:17.142 --> 31:18.942
- Oh, why didn't you ask?
- Here.

31:21.913 --> 31:24.548
The "s" stands for shot,
or maybe it's schiff.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.149
Let me know if you find
anything gross in her book.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.018
I have a feeling she's a total
freak in the sack.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.386
- Okay.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.888
What's your deal?

31:30.890 --> 31:33.490
- I have no deal.
- You're a child.

31:33.492 --> 31:34.958
- Okay, grandpa,
that's a little...

31:34.960 --> 31:39.463
- what are you even
doing stuck here?

31:39.465 --> 31:41.899
What do they have on you?

31:41.901 --> 31:44.668
- Nothing.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.136
Okay, fine,
they're protecting me.

31:46.138 --> 31:49.072
- Protecting you from what?

31:49.074 --> 31:52.042
- My dad is a businessman

31:52.044 --> 31:54.411
and sometimes his competition
can get a little rough,

31:54.413 --> 31:55.946
so he sent me here.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.649
- Like, he's a...
- Legitimate businessman.

31:58.651 --> 32:00.384
Can we please not talk about it?

32:00.386 --> 32:02.986
- My god, you're like
that whiny little kid

32:02.988 --> 32:05.389
in "the sopranos," Willow.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.157
- Jesus Christ, you are so lame.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.926
Please.

32:10.228 --> 32:12.229
And her name was Meadow.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.236
- You truthied me?

32:19.238 --> 32:21.171
I can't lie.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.573
Eliot, I did this for you.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.176
- There was no other way.
- Don't.

32:28.012 --> 32:30.614
You started this
when you declared war.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.550
Now my wife and child are gone.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.118
I need to deal with the rats.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.722
I can't risk having to
clean up your next mess.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.162
Guards.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.064
- No, Eliot.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.600
- What are you doing?
- I don't know what else to do.

32:50.602 --> 32:54.004
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

32:54.006 --> 32:56.707
Eliot...

32:56.709 --> 32:58.642
I'll fix this.

33:00.712 --> 33:04.047
- Make sure she gets
the best room.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.550
And see that she gets
her coconut oil.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.585
Good-bye, Margo.

33:17.061 --> 33:19.997
<i>- Oh, shit!</i>

33:42.588 --> 33:45.022
- I know you're in there.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.623
Come out.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.558
It's okay.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.060
It's me.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.566
Oh, my god.

34:00.204 --> 34:05.242
- Julia, I found her.
- She's...

34:05.244 --> 34:06.543
- Quentin.

34:08.446 --> 34:11.248
I missed you so much.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.617
- Oh, my god.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.185
Hi.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.158
- Are you okay?

34:21.159 --> 34:22.492
- Yeah.
- Are you?

34:22.494 --> 34:25.328
- Not really.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.696
Without you.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.632
- Did you get Reynard yet?

34:29.635 --> 34:31.668
- I'm trying.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.545
- She talks about him
all the time.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.614
Says he's a good guy.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.250
Stupid sometimes, but good.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.589
- Is there any way
we can take her with us too?

35:06.537 --> 35:09.272
- I know you told security
to keep me out,

35:09.274 --> 35:11.575
but then I suggested
they let me in.

35:11.577 --> 35:14.277
Stalemate, I guess.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.146
Is this about Cowden?

35:16.148 --> 35:18.448
I think you just
overwhelmed him a little.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.218
I know it's a lot,
but it's worth it.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.320
- My wife.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.689
Is anything about our
relationship real?

35:25.691 --> 35:28.792
I've been controlling her
from the day we met, right?

35:28.794 --> 35:31.294
- Yes.
- Lucky her.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.230
- How is that?

35:33.232 --> 35:34.698
She's a person.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.233
- Yes.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.501
And you're not.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.302
The sooner you wrap
your head around that...

35:39.304 --> 35:41.538
- no, no.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.572
I don't want it.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.741
- You want to be president

35:44.743 --> 35:47.244
of this entire idiotic country.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.412
You have always
sensed your place.

35:49.414 --> 35:51.715
- Julia and Kady, they said
you did terrible things.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.617
I should've looked you up
on the spot.

35:53.619 --> 35:56.520
- You didn't because I
gently suggested you don't.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.255
It's for your own good, kid.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.223
- So it's all true.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.725
Those poor women.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.593
Those women were hardly victims.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.829
- They said they were just
trying to summon a little help

36:05.831 --> 36:07.430
from some kind of goddess...

36:07.432 --> 36:10.600
- they were summoning
an evil bitch!

36:10.602 --> 36:12.602
You looked me up,
says trickster.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.204
See, that's honest.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.505
Yes, I fuck with the weak.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.407
You know what that does?
Improves the herd.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.843
I help the same little creatures
you want to help.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.578
It's not surprising,
you're my son,

36:21.580 --> 36:23.480
how else could it be but her?

36:23.482 --> 36:26.316
The benevolent
"our lady underground."

36:26.318 --> 36:27.851
It is all about her.

36:27.853 --> 36:31.688
Power, attention, grinding men
and gods into the fucking dirt

36:31.690 --> 36:33.757
and then she leaves!

36:43.534 --> 36:47.504
You loved her.

36:47.506 --> 36:50.574
- Guess there's some things
you can't control, after all.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.511
- I can see you're upset.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.379
But I need you
to move past that.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.748
Stop worrying about humans.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.650
They're beneath you.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.553
This is your birthright, son.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.388
We're gonna do so much together.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.361
- How'd you do it?
- You know, turn me back?

37:11.363 --> 37:13.296
- A special Fillorian mint.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.632
And about 50 straight minutes
of casting,

37:15.634 --> 37:18.768
so I'm gonna need a minute
to recharge.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.671
You sure you don't want
any clothes, or...

37:21.673 --> 37:23.440
- Eh.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.574
Can't you get Margo to help?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.276
You know, give you a break?

37:26.278 --> 37:27.811
- I kind of threw her
in the dungeon.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.479
- Got ya.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.448
Well, you'll run yourself dead,

37:31.450 --> 37:32.582
doing everything on your own.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.284
- Believe me, I know.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.786
- Pass some shit down the chain
to the governors

37:36.788 --> 37:41.658
or the Dukes or whatever.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.294
You don't have any governors?

37:44.296 --> 37:45.762
No Dukes?

37:45.764 --> 37:49.366
- Get you some delegates, son.
- Right, really good idea.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.768
Select governors.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.737
Yet another task
for the high king.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.473
- Or you just hold an election.

37:56.475 --> 38:00.577
Let the people pick their own,
you do <i> nada.</i>

38:00.579 --> 38:01.878
- That's...
- Stupid, is it stupid?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.747
- I'm sorry.
- Brilliant, Josh.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.683
I think you just invented
democracy,

38:06.685 --> 38:08.585
and it's going to save Fillory.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.887
- Well, high five, brother.

38:15.661 --> 38:18.828
- Eliot?
- What the hell?

38:20.798 --> 38:23.900
- Dude, I thought you were
off being, like,

38:23.902 --> 38:26.403
the high king of Fillory?

38:26.405 --> 38:28.538
- I am.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.441
I was.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.543
I think I just got kicked out.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.555
<i>- Of course her book
is relocated</i>

38:45.557 --> 38:47.857
to the poison room.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.359
- Okay.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.061
So what's our next move?

38:51.063 --> 38:52.529
- Admit I'm fucking cursed?

38:52.531 --> 38:53.530
<i>- Is this all you guys do?</i>

38:53.532 --> 38:55.065
Talk about your fee-fees?

38:55.067 --> 38:57.434
I was kind of hoping
you'd get to fucking.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.069
- How did you...

38:59.071 --> 39:01.805
- oh, hopped into your mind
when you hopped into hers.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.373
It's a little trick
my dad's friends taught me.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.409
- Your dad's friends
are perverts?

39:06.411 --> 39:07.944
- Thugs.
- Magic mobsters.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.012
- No, they're not.
- Jesus.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.413
- Which is why I'm leaving.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.415
- So's Willow.
- Meadow, doofus.

39:12.417 --> 39:13.583
Fine, kick me out.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.085
You really don't need my help.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.553
- Help with what?

39:16.555 --> 39:19.356
- Trying to break into
the poison room.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.524
I've been in your crappy Nolan
movie for, like, 20 minutes.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.393
I heard everything.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.661
Been trying to get in there
myself, 'cause, you know,

39:24.663 --> 39:26.463
I'm curious about a few things.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.431
So you can either start from
square one on your own,

39:28.433 --> 39:31.534
or you can hop the line
and join...

39:33.003 --> 39:34.938
- Well, the pervy mob girl
has a point.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.040
- No.
- It's dangerous.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.843
- You know what's safe?
- Nothing.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.144
You're not responsible
for me, okay?

39:41.146 --> 39:44.647
Free will, I exercise that shit.

39:44.649 --> 39:45.882
- I'm gonna hate this.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.450
- You hate everything.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.519
That's why I like you.

39:49.521 --> 39:52.155
<i>- Kady.
- Kady!</i>

39:52.157 --> 39:54.057
<i>Kady, wake up.</i>

39:56.894 --> 39:58.862
- Kady.
- Hey.

39:58.864 --> 40:02.031
- What?
- Hey, you, uh, you got a guest.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.502
Professor Lipson told me
to bring him here.

40:10.007 --> 40:12.475
- If you're still after Reynard,

40:12.477 --> 40:14.511
I want in.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.183
- Eliot?

40:22.654 --> 40:24.421
Oh, you.

40:24.423 --> 40:27.090
- I shouldn't be here, but...

40:29.460 --> 40:32.061
Please.
Your majesty.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.597
- Be careful.
- So not a nice scotch, then?

40:34.599 --> 40:38.701
- It will transport you
to the fairy realm.

40:38.703 --> 40:42.172
I must warn you, few return.

40:42.174 --> 40:45.508
But it is a chance to save fen,

40:45.510 --> 40:47.911
the baby.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.579
I would go, but...

40:49.581 --> 40:52.015
- you're a pussy who's in love
with a sloth,

40:52.017 --> 40:54.451
who's currently a rat.

40:54.453 --> 40:58.188
And end of the day,
it's my mess to clean up.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.457
Tell Eliot that.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.035
<i>- Q, it's time.</i>

41:14.104 --> 41:16.206
- This is it.

41:16.208 --> 41:17.774
It's who I couldn't make
the math work.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.108
- What math?

41:19.110 --> 41:20.977
- Uh, the spell
to bring Alice back.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.012
I knew something was missing,
I just didn't know...

41:23.014 --> 41:27.050
- It was me.

41:27.052 --> 41:28.685
You have to go now.

41:28.687 --> 41:30.687
There's a portal in there,

41:30.689 --> 41:32.755
back to reception.

41:32.757 --> 41:34.991
And I'm glad we got to
say good-bye.

41:38.562 --> 41:41.231
Um, I'm gonna be back here
for good one day,

41:41.233 --> 41:44.634
and I am going to find you.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.139
Okay.

41:59.551 --> 42:00.817
- You first.

42:20.738 --> 42:23.706
- Jules, what the hell?
- This isn't up for debate.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.141
- We came here
so that you could...

42:25.143 --> 42:27.143
- yeah?
- So?

42:27.145 --> 42:29.145
Things change.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.713
- If you do this...
- I know.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.749
This is my one shot.

42:32.751 --> 42:34.584
And this is what
I want to do with it.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.553
- I found them!
- Stop!

42:36.555 --> 42:37.787
- Come on,
or we'll lose her, too.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.122
<i>- You can't take that shade!</i>

42:41.159 --> 42:43.626
- It's all going to be okay,
Quentin.
