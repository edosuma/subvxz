Christmas.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.826
Also, the house was ransacked

17:06.859 --> 17:08.495
in search of what,
we're not yet sure.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.897
But, as of yesterday,
we pinned the crime

17:10.930 --> 17:13.233
on an ex-convict
named Maurice LeFay.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.835
This is from hard evidence,
fingerprints and the like.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.271
Turns out your brother
was his parole officer.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.339
-Ray?
-WINNIE: Yes, sir.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.507
And that got us wondering,

17:20.540 --> 17:21.908
especially since
Mr. Stussy, Raymond,

17:21.941 --> 17:24.244
his car got rammed into
by another vehicle

17:24.277 --> 17:25.945
registered to your company
and...

17:25.978 --> 17:27.680
Allegedly,
words exchanged between Ray

17:27.714 --> 17:30.183
and a yet-to-be-identified
member of your team.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.751
-My team?
-Yes, sir.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.120
And we thought it curious

17:33.153 --> 17:34.954
the house being targeted
and searched as it was

17:34.987 --> 17:37.190
that he shared the same last
name as you and your brother.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.525
The same first initial.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.393
WINNIE: Lived in towns
with similar names.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.396
What are they...

17:44.764 --> 17:47.567
Is there some kind of feud
between you and Ray?

17:49.102 --> 17:50.870
A feud? No.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.573
'Cause we had your brother
into the station,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.542

17:55.575 --> 17:56.876
EMMIT: Well, I mean...

17:56.909 --> 17:59.112
Okay, we had our differences
over the years.

brother and the victim?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.396

kind of disagreement

19:05.512 --> 19:07.280

you and your brother?

36:17.609 --> 36:19.044
I'm at Ray's.

36:19.077 --> 36:21.847

(DOOR CLOSES)

38:52.998 --> 38:54.199
Did anyone see you?

38:55.834 --> 38:59.237
I'm so rarely seen,
maybe I don't even exist.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.309
(WHISTLES)

39:04.342 --> 39:05.844
What's he doing here?

39:06.678 --> 39:08.213
You called for help.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.349
This is what help looks like.

39:14.219 --> 39:17.222
I wanted to find his pulse,
but I was afraid.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.226
Afraid you'd
leave fingerprints?

39:22.861 --> 39:25.697
Where else might we find
your fingerprints?

39:26.898 --> 39:28.934
Uh, I came in that door.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.269
So, the knob, inside and out.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.805
(STAMMERING)
That frame, the glass.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.042
MEEMO: Bury the body,
missing person?

39:43.248 --> 39:44.282
No.

39:46.251 --> 39:47.586
Collect the frame
and the stamp,

39:47.619 --> 39:49.054
and leave the glass.

39:53.258 --> 39:56.394
Is there someplace you're
supposed to be right now?

40:00.966 --> 40:04.536
Is there someplace you're
supposed to be right now?

40:04.570 --> 40:06.438
Uh, what time is it?

40:08.974 --> 40:10.876
(STAMMERS)
A meeting, a dinner.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.378
Which is it,
a meeting or a dinner?

40:13.411 --> 40:14.780
Uh, dinner.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.247
With whom?

40:17.148 --> 40:19.384
-Sy.
-Which restaurant?

40:19.417 --> 40:21.553
Uh, it's in my phone.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.622
Never mind, never mind.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.323
Listen, this is important.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.258
If the restaurant
has a back door,

40:27.292 --> 40:28.560
go to the bathroom

40:28.594 --> 40:30.496
and wash your face and hands
in very cold water,

40:30.529 --> 40:32.731
then go to the table.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.900
That way,
if any witnesses see you,

40:34.933 --> 40:36.768
they won't be able
to time your arrival.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.236
Do you understand?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.738
Yeah, but...

40:39.771 --> 40:41.172
Emmit.

40:42.474 --> 40:43.875
Look at me.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.512
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

40:50.348 --> 40:52.851
Your brother

40:52.884 --> 40:57.055
was killed by
his ex-convict girlfriend.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.126
He'd been abusing her,
you see?

41:01.159 --> 41:03.629
Beating her in places
you don't show.

41:03.662 --> 41:07.032
And tonight she'd had enough,
so she cut his throat.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.969
And watched him bleed.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.038
Now,

41:13.071 --> 41:14.973
the police will
contact you tonight

41:15.006 --> 41:16.708
to inform you of his death.

41:16.742 --> 41:19.377
Be upset, not too upset.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.947
Volunteer nothing,
you haven't seen him for days,

41:21.980 --> 41:23.615
you haven't spoken to him.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.817
I called him on his cell.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.353
-When?
-Yesterday.

41:28.386 --> 41:31.222
Right. Well,
there'll be a record of that.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.560
Did you speak for long?

41:34.593 --> 41:35.994
Just a few minutes.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.665
All right.
Well, it's just a quick call,

41:39.698 --> 41:41.332
just to catch up, innit?

41:42.267 --> 41:43.501
Be vague.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.108
I didn't mean to...

41:53.845 --> 41:55.413
No one ever does.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.387
Walk him to his car,
out in the back.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.890
Make sure you're not seen.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.011
EMMIT: ...nothing like a feud.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.378
VARGA:
Will wonders never cease?

42:27.412 --> 42:29.080
RAY: Go figure.
It's a pretty common name.

42:29.114 --> 42:30.949
-There's jealousy there.
-VARGA: Ladies shoes.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.383
(EMMIT LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

42:32.417 --> 42:33.418
Screw it.

42:44.462 --> 42:46.131
FEMALE DISPATCHER:
Go ahead, Eden Valley.

42:46.164 --> 42:48.634
Yeah, I'm trying to get
a message to Officer Lopez.

42:48.667 --> 42:51.102
Tell her I'm heading back
to the PO's domicile.

42:51.136 --> 42:52.638
Have her meet me there.

42:52.671 --> 42:53.905
Will do.
