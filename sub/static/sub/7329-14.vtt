WEBVTT

00:06.307 --> 00:08.418
Okay, I came to a bar with you.

00:08.442 --> 00:09.586
Now let's go.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.421
No. No way.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.323
I've been listening to you
complain the entire year

00:13.347 --> 00:14.591
you don't have
a girlfriend, okay?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.981
All right, well,
here they all are.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.631
Yeah, I'm not very good
at picking up girls.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.800
Look, even the worst
pickup lines are better

00:23.824 --> 00:25.435
than not trying.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.803
Now, come on. Give me something.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.318
So, is it hot in here
or is it just you?

00:31.165 --> 00:33.176
Give me something else.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.312
You Jamaican?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.964
'Cause you Jamaican me crazy.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.051
I stand corrected.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.853
That's absolutely worse
than not trying.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.902
Maybe you should
just try being yourself.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.350
Just be cool.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.763
Yeah, well, if I was being
myself, I wouldn't be here.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.599
Yeah, I know how you feel.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.567
My name's Lynne.

00:57.591 --> 00:58.591
Alfonso.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.422
If you don't want
to be here, how come, uh...

01:09.870 --> 01:12.349
Don't have a TV at home?

01:12.373 --> 01:14.484
Not being cool.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.544
That's, uh,
that's my brother's car.

01:23.951 --> 01:27.063
Roman, what the hell's
going on, man?!

01:27.087 --> 01:28.898
Alfonso, listen
carefully. It's happening.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.380
Wherever you are,
you've got to run! Now!

02:05.292 --> 02:06.903
Dancing lessons?

02:06.927 --> 02:08.238
You cannot be serious.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.839
May 25, National Tap Dance Day.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.007
I want to be prepared.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.509
What if you're unprepared?

02:12.533 --> 02:15.245
Well, the unprepared do not
get invited to the National.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.081
Tap Dance parties,
and I want to go.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.116
I got a tweet to go to this blog

02:20.140 --> 02:22.152
that linked me
to this holiday site.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.487
Do you know
how many holidays there are

02:24.511 --> 02:25.722
that fly underneath the radar?

02:25.746 --> 02:26.890
It's astonishing.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.758
Lot of ladies at those parties.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.859
I went to an International.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.828
Talk Like a Pirate Day party
last year.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.897
You did not. Excellent.

02:33.921 --> 02:34.898
Argh!

02:34.922 --> 02:36.266
Let me hear some pirate speak.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.492
Why is McGee wearing
a tuxedo jacket?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.741
Yes.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.276
Tuxedo.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.945
It's a bold fashion choice
for a young investigator.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.266
Shh.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.317
Watch Someone
Get Married at Work Day?

02:54.341 --> 02:55.685
It's an online wedding.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.420
Of course it is.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.923
Look, it's a gamer buddy
from Spain.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.792
He set this up for people
that couldn't make it, okay?

03:02.816 --> 03:04.794
I would be laughing if

03:04.818 --> 03:06.930
I weren't on the edge
of tears. This is sad.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.421
Grab your gear. We got a...

03:10.124 --> 03:11.167
He's at a wedding.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.836
In Spain.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.794
Uh, boss, it's almost done.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.375
Take your time.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.377
I think McGee is taking
this technology thing

03:20.401 --> 03:21.478
a little too far.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.046
And this is coming from the man

03:23.070 --> 03:25.436
who follows tweets
to blogs to Web sites.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.019
All done, boss. Thanks.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.354
Let's go.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.356
Grab your gear.
Got an exploding car.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.681
Got a dead Marine.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.028
Could I just have a minute to...

03:39.052 --> 03:40.888
Nope. You've had
your minute, McGee.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.701
Lucky the blast was isolated.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.853
Considering the debris radius,
this could have been much worse.

03:48.595 --> 03:49.806
Not for this guy.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.174
Boss, the car was registered to

03:51.198 --> 03:53.476
a Lance Corporal Roman Vega,
stationed at Quantico,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.578
just back
from his second tour in Iraq.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.080
The chase started at Olive

03:57.104 --> 03:58.715
and 29th when Vega
ran a stop sign.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.484
About a half mile later, the car
hit a pothole and kaboom.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.186
Acetone hydroxide.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.321
Bless you.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.823
It is an explosive, Tony.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.725
It was in the trunk.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.194
Has a very distinctive odor,
highly volatile.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.396
Given the lack
of any discernible trigger

04:13.420 --> 04:14.731
and timing of detonation,

04:14.755 --> 04:17.200
the explosion was likely
an accident.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.935
Why would a Marine be driving
around with explosives

04:19.959 --> 04:21.271
in his trunk?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.273
- We found the torso.
- Yes.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.408
It's resting in peace
around the corner there

04:25.432 --> 04:26.776
by that Dumpster.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.344
Matches Corporal Vega's
general build,

04:28.368 --> 04:29.913
but, uh, the burns
are extensive.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.581
We will probably need

04:31.605 --> 04:34.184
DNA for a positive
identification.

04:34.208 --> 04:37.287
In the meantime, uh,
he's ready for his close-up.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.457
We're still missing

04:40.481 --> 04:43.393
several major body parts.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.694
Ah. Yeah, sorry.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.117
I forgot about this.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.203
It's the head. Yeah.

04:53.227 --> 04:55.038
- What's left of it.
- DNA.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.706
Yeah, landed, uh,

04:56.730 --> 04:59.209
back behind an old
bowling alley, of all places.

04:59.233 --> 05:02.779
I do hope, if the time comes,

05:02.803 --> 05:05.915
when your head finds itself
removed from your body,

05:05.939 --> 05:07.784
it is treated with more respect.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.319
Ducky, I...

05:09.343 --> 05:11.321
- Mr. Palmer!
- Yes, sir?

05:11.345 --> 05:15.558
We are still missing
two patellas and a shin bone.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.927
- McGee!
- Boss, you know I didn't mean to be disrespectful.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.162
Get a tow truck.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.619
Right.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.304
That's weird.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.907
Weirder than you carrying
a head around in a bag

05:30.931 --> 05:32.208
and forgetting about it?

05:32.232 --> 05:33.443
What?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.111
No, no, no, no, no.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.280
See, I get a signal over here.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.850
Closer to the car,
drops off in inches.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.453
Yeah, I got a dead spot like
that in my therapist's office.

05:43.477 --> 05:47.423
Well, dead zones
are common inside, but out...

05:47.447 --> 05:49.425
Therapist?

05:49.449 --> 05:51.995
Physical therapist.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.530
Why are you seeing
a physical therapist?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.365
Hurt my knee.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.533
How'd you do that?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.868
Kneeling.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.069
I don't believe you.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.526
Come on.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.815
What's that, a lie detector?

06:12.839 --> 06:15.051
No. It's a Geiger counter.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.452
Just thought of something
that could

06:16.476 --> 06:18.412
cause localized RF interference.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.893
Whoa.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.062
Ooh.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.077
Radiation.

06:35.996 --> 06:39.142
First, uh, plague,
now radiation poisoning.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.411
I'm starting to think
someone really has it in for me.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.246
I was there, too,
near the car, you know.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.747
We all were.

06:44.771 --> 06:47.050
But don't let that stop you
from thinking about yourself.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.184
This isn't about me.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.186
It's about my little
DiNozzo makers.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.221
They've been nuked.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.823
- I know.
- Do you?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.892
I mean, sure, Tim,
your kids are gonna be smart,

06:55.916 --> 06:59.996
but mine had a shot
at being really beautiful.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.353
Well, hopefully, Gibbs will
bring us some good news.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.293
Oh, that doesn't look
like good news.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.238
I was so worried!

07:09.262 --> 07:10.490
Abby?

07:14.234 --> 07:15.445
I hitched a ride

07:15.469 --> 07:17.113
with the Emergency
Response Team when I heard.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.348
You guys okay?

07:18.372 --> 07:19.549
You tell us.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.850
Yeah, you're okay.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.653
They only found minute traces
of radiation on the car.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.755
You guys could even get
your clothes back.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.423
Nice work, McPanic.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.858
What was the source
of the radiation?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.026
Well, the good news is

07:30.050 --> 07:31.594
that it wasn't
from the explosion.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.429
But the vehicle...
it had been used

07:33.453 --> 07:34.964
to transport something
called cobalt-60.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.133
It's a by-product
of nuclear reactors.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.103
It's used for, like, industrial
mining and X-ray machines.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.971
Dirty bombs.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.606
And why was Lance Corporal Vega

07:43.630 --> 07:45.375
transporting
radioactive material?

07:45.399 --> 07:47.443
If it can be used
to make a dirty bomb,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.061
where is it now?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.918
All ATM footage
from the terminal, okay?

07:55.942 --> 07:58.321
All the information regarding
international travel...

07:58.345 --> 08:00.223
All right, and nobody
talks to the press.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.924
- And do not talk to the press!
- And don't talk to the press!

08:01.948 --> 08:03.760
This just in.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.461
Actually, I think
it's a little too late for that.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.463
Concerns that a radiological
dispersal device,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.232
commonly known as
a dirty bomb...

08:09.256 --> 08:10.566
"Dirty bomb loose in D.C."?

08:10.590 --> 08:12.301
We don't even know there is
a dirty bomb out there.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.469
Nope, but it's good for ratings.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.804
Okay, Corporal Vega...
Gibbs is gonna want

08:14.828 --> 08:16.739
a full briefing when
he gets done talking to Vance.

08:16.763 --> 08:17.740
What do we got?

08:17.764 --> 08:19.942
Well, we did
a preliminary workup

08:19.966 --> 08:21.835
while you were showering
for the third time.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.814
Lance Corporal Roman Vega.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.115
Born in Lima, Peru, 1981.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.317
He and his younger brother
Alfonso went to live

08:28.341 --> 08:30.253
with their aunt in Maryland
after their parents were killed.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.688
Cell records show

08:31.712 --> 08:33.222
that Roman placed
a call to his brother

08:33.246 --> 08:34.390
during the police chase.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.525
Well, let's bring him in.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.626
No one knows where he is.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.461
Well, then find him!

08:38.485 --> 08:39.761
Kind of busy, Leon.

08:39.785 --> 08:41.297
You're gonna want to hear this.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.700
Special Agent Gibbs,
meet Walter Kane.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.435
I'm glad to
finally meet you, Gunny.

08:45.459 --> 08:46.969
Been following you
for some time.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.971
Yeah? Really?

08:48.995 --> 08:50.506
What, on my blog?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.742
Not exactly,
but I do my own research.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.977
I knew we'd be meeting up
eventually.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.312
How's that?

08:56.336 --> 08:58.781
Lance Corporal Roman Vega.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.783
Mr. Kane runs
a private intelligence firm.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.385
They do work for the Pentagon.

09:02.409 --> 09:03.820
Yeah, between Iraq
and Afghanistan,

09:03.844 --> 09:06.556
our country's own intel services
are stretched thin, so...

09:06.580 --> 09:08.658
So we outsource firms
like Mr. Kane's

09:08.682 --> 09:10.727
for countries
that we're not at war with.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.428
- Like Peru.
- Good guess.

09:12.452 --> 09:13.896
We handle it exclusively.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.567
Currently, we're tracking
a group out of Lima

09:17.591 --> 09:19.368
called Libertad Nueva.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.369
Means...

09:20.393 --> 09:21.504
New Liberty?

09:21.528 --> 09:23.940
They claim to be
a grassroots organization,

09:23.964 --> 09:27.543
formed to protest U.S.
anti-drug policies in Peru.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.213
Which they say have caused
civilian casualties.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.748
It's a lie.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.349
They're not freedom fighters.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.085
They're drug dealers who just
want the U.S. out of their hair.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.720
We think
they're planning an attack,

09:37.744 --> 09:39.822
hoping to weaken our resolve.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.457
What do you got on Vega?

09:41.481 --> 09:43.559
Well, he's been seen
with suspected.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.727
LN members in Lima.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.096
And for a man
with no family in Peru,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.698
he travels there quite a bit.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.466
That's it?

09:50.490 --> 09:53.136
That and the fact
that his car glows in the dark.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.570
I don't deny

09:54.594 --> 09:56.939
our intelligence linking Vega
to these terrorists is slim.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.241
We're victims of budget cuts

09:58.265 --> 10:00.042
like everyone else,
but we're sure

10:00.066 --> 10:01.511
there's a cell here.

10:01.535 --> 10:03.780
And Vega was our only link
to them.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.581
Well, thank you.
We'll take it from here.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.596
Thank you, sir.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.623
I have to testify
before the Senate.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.259
An upcoming
defense contractor bill.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.094
Reason we don't have money
for real intelligence is,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.929
the boys on the Hill
love to spend money

10:19.953 --> 10:21.388
on toys that
we don't really need.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.867
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Vega just checked

10:24.891 --> 10:26.536
his e-mail at the Belmont Hotel.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.537
I'll be right down.

10:27.561 --> 10:29.138
Got a lead on Roman's brother.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.874
He just logged on
to his e-mail account.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.309
Belmont Hotel.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.245
Hotel manager said Vega came
into the lobby two hours ago,

10:36.269 --> 10:37.513
used the guest computer...

10:37.537 --> 10:39.115
Then checked into Room 102.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.217
People have been coming
and going ever since.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.385
What kind of people?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.587
He said the kind of people
he wouldn't want

10:44.611 --> 10:46.322
to mess with.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.447
- We knocking?
- No.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.515
Would you like the honors?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.846
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.670
NCIS! Federal agents!

11:00.694 --> 11:02.071
Authorities believe a Peruvian

11:02.095 --> 11:03.072
terrorist organization called...

11:03.096 --> 11:04.974
- What the?
- Put them down!

11:04.998 --> 11:06.142
You put them down!
Federal agents.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.224
Don't see any I.D.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.412
That won't be necessary.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.947
Put your weapons down.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.916
Hello, Mr. Gibbs.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.931
You know each other?

11:17.043 --> 11:19.355
He's my client.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.090
Your client?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.291
That's right.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.459
Since when, Alfonso?

11:23.483 --> 11:25.595
Don't answer that.

11:25.619 --> 11:27.496
This is going to get ugly.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.332
I hope so.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.690
Go on. Get out of here.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.004
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Give us a minute.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.572
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.596
Come on.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.617
You seen the news lately?

11:47.641 --> 11:48.784
I have.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.819
We don't have time for this.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.554
For what? The rule of law?

11:51.578 --> 11:54.274
I don't have a problem
with the law.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.561
Roman Vega was
a new client of mine.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.329
He contacted me a few weeks ago.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.464
About?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.566
Sorry, attorney-client
privilege.

12:03.590 --> 12:07.370
After Mr. Vega was killed,
his brother called me.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.504
He was scared.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.939
He wanted to talk.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.488
Don't bother asking
me about... what.

12:18.672 --> 12:21.150
As a precaution,
I told him to meet me here,

12:21.174 --> 12:22.551
and I arranged
for private security.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.543
Colonel Bell's men?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.858
Colonel Bell owed me a favor
after I rescued him

12:28.882 --> 12:30.993
from that Mexican hellhole
you sent him to.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.963
Not me, the rule of law.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.699
Which also says I have
the right to talk to Alfonso.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.601
Yes, it does.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.671
And you're more than welcome.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.526
As long as I'm in the room.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.721
Did I miss it?

12:58.745 --> 12:59.956
Nope, just starting.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.709
Where's Ziva?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.178
Bringing the popcorn.

13:09.889 --> 13:13.636
Mr. Gibbs is trying
to make you nervous.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.820
Don't let him.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.274
Special Agent.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.642
Excuse me?

13:19.666 --> 13:22.294
Special Agent Gibbs.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.015
And I'm not trying
to make you nervous.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.083
I just need answers.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.151
And I think
you want answers, too,

13:29.175 --> 13:30.653
considering your brother
is dead.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.589
Now he's trying to piss you off.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.171
Just ask the questions.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.728
You talked to
your brother, right,

13:38.752 --> 13:40.329
before the explosion?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.164
Yeah.

13:42.188 --> 13:44.156
What did he say?

13:45.191 --> 13:47.069
He told me to run.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.471
Why?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.072
Don't answer that.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.907
Did he tell you
why he was transporting

13:51.931 --> 13:53.275
radioactive material?

13:53.299 --> 13:54.577
Don't answer that.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.212
Did you know
that he was a member

13:56.236 --> 13:57.726
of Libertad Nueva?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.285
Looks like you didn't.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.321
Nicely done.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.257
Ziva better hurry
or she is going to miss it.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.493
Would you like to confer
with your client?

14:10.517 --> 14:13.195
Because I think he knows
something you don't know.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.697
Look, Roman didn't
do anything wrong.

14:14.721 --> 14:15.798
- We need a moment alone.
- No.

14:15.822 --> 14:16.999
Yes!

14:17.023 --> 14:19.101
He's fishing,
and that's dangerous.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.003
Mr. Gibbs has put
plenty of guilty men

14:21.027 --> 14:23.506
behind bars, but he's also
put some innocent ones away.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.707
What's Libertad Nueva?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.308
They're drug dealers,
terrorists.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.310
No.

14:28.334 --> 14:29.979
Roman would never be involved
in either one of those.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.714
But he was involved
with something.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.717
Don't answer that.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.208
I want answers, too.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.956
I don't know what
Roman was messed up in,

14:40.980 --> 14:42.958
but whatever it was...

14:42.982 --> 14:44.711
had him really freaked out.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.664
He wouldn't give me
any details, but...

14:48.688 --> 14:50.315
He wanted you to do something.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.671
I work for a cell phone company.

14:55.695 --> 14:59.675
He asked me to back-trace

14:59.699 --> 15:02.964
some calls to a warehouse
in Virginia.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.681
He wouldn't tell me why.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.229
He just told me
not to trust anybody.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.245
I hope I'm not making
a mistake trusting you.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.932
Think he's telling the truth?

15:22.956 --> 15:25.117
He's telling a story...
not sure whose.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.070
The popcorn!

15:28.094 --> 15:31.231
I burnt the first batch, but...

15:32.699 --> 15:35.678
DiNozzo, take Ziva
and check out that warehouse.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.712
Taking Ziva.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.904
Checking out the warehouse.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.130
Well, I'm sure you're
feeling pretty satisfied.

15:45.979 --> 15:49.972
I am going to go get a haircut.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.701
Yeah. I'm feeling
pretty satisfied.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.669
Good.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.404
Then you can release my client.

16:02.428 --> 16:03.939
I can.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.242
You have no right to hold him.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.743
You haven't charged him
with anything.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.860
Terrorism. Don't need to.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.816
Spoken like
a Third World dictator.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.117
Hey, I don't make the rules.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.418
He's telling the truth,
he's better off here.

16:16.442 --> 16:17.419
Oh, how noble of you.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.688
Fine!

16:19.712 --> 16:22.424
Well, then if he's staying,
I'm staying.

16:22.448 --> 16:23.826
Fine.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.977
Just past the door
to the vending machines.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.333
Gun battle?

16:31.357 --> 16:32.334
Gibbs.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.736
Hand-to-hand?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.304
Gibbs.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.106
- Knife fight?
- Ooh.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.908
Right?

16:38.932 --> 16:41.043
Something about our friendly
neighborhood counselor

16:41.067 --> 16:43.136
makes you think she might
be good with a blade.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.916
Well, she is tenacious.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.717
And training is important
in a knife fight,

16:48.741 --> 16:50.777
but not as important as spirit.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.542
What is that?

16:58.585 --> 17:00.462
It's a Geiger counter.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.665
Can't be too careful.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.534
What do you think Corporal Vega
was doing at an empty warehouse?

17:05.558 --> 17:08.704
I don't know. Why don't you
pick the lock and find out?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.973
We do not have a warrant.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.508
This building is foreclosed,

17:12.531 --> 17:14.042
which means it's owned
by the banks, and since

17:14.067 --> 17:15.211
the people own the banks,

17:15.234 --> 17:16.896
I think technically
we own the building.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.596
Wow.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.219
Lock picked.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.222
I do not think our friendly
neighborhood counselor

17:26.246 --> 17:28.022
- would approve.
- Yeah.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.126
Well, let her spend a night
working a homicide.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.995
Tell ya...

17:33.019 --> 17:35.331
things aren't so
black-and-white when the walls

17:35.355 --> 17:37.733
are all splattered
with red, are they?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.969
Or when your way of life
is threatened.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.620
Exactly.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.007
Wait a second.
Are you mocking me?

17:45.031 --> 17:47.610
No, Tony, I was not mocking you.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.646
It's just that, uh... when I was

17:50.670 --> 17:52.648
held hostage in Somalia,
Saleem used

17:52.672 --> 17:55.217
similar justifications
for his actions.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.987
Saleem.

17:58.011 --> 18:01.323
- Caf-POW!
- Swilling sociopath was a terrorist, Ziva.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.791
I'm sure he would say

18:02.815 --> 18:04.442
he was just protecting
his way of life.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.529
You're not seriously
defending him, are you?

18:07.553 --> 18:09.565
No, Tony. His actions
were indefensible,

18:09.589 --> 18:12.034
regardless of his reasons.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.083
And that is my point.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.740
This country holds itself
to a higher standard.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.209
It is a nation of laws,
which are to be followed

18:20.233 --> 18:22.098
not only when it is
convenient or easy.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.315
I have seen firsthand
what happens

18:26.339 --> 18:29.831
when convenience wins out.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.502
You never talk about it.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.213
What is there to talk about?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.712
Come on, Ziva.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.452
What Saleem did was bad enough.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.956
Becoming like him
would be worse.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.884
The food is fresh.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.876
Whoever was here
left in a hurry.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.708
They had a little
bonfire before they split.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.328
Acetone hydroxide.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.683
Lots of wires.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.785
Couple of timers.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.558
They were building a bomb.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.439
It's definitely the dirty kind.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.341
I found traces of cobalt-60

19:25.365 --> 19:28.177
on all the evidence
that Tony and Ziva brought in.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.635
Is it safe?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.848
Yeah, totally.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.550
This was just way
too cool to take off.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.476
And I like the sound
it makes when I move.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.855
So did Tony and Ziva
get any prints?

19:39.879 --> 19:41.590
Oh, hundreds.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.193
But judging by
the decomposition of skin oil,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.295
I'm thinking that they belong

19:46.319 --> 19:48.297
to the building's old occupants.
I'm running them now.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.099
Any idea how big a bomb
could be out there?

19:50.123 --> 19:52.801
It looks like they mixed
enough acetone hydroxide

19:52.825 --> 19:55.137
to blow up Roman Vega's car,
like, five times over.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.606
So most of it is
still out there.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.942
Tony and Ziva
also found an old laptop.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.477
It's burnt to a crisp,

20:01.501 --> 20:03.979
but I still think I can get
something off the hard drive.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.147
All right, well, let me know.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.548
I got to report back to Gibbs.

20:06.572 --> 20:08.301
Wait, wait, wait!

20:12.311 --> 20:14.623
What?

20:14.647 --> 20:15.891
I can't believe this.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.359
I had my whole presentation
timed out perfectly.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.560
So when I said, "I can still

20:18.584 --> 20:20.129
pull something
off the hard drive,"

20:20.153 --> 20:21.821
my decryption algorithm
was supposed to...

20:23.890 --> 20:25.825
Better late than never.

20:26.893 --> 20:31.073
Okay, so there's only two things
on the laptop:

20:31.097 --> 20:33.842
An encrypted video file
and solitaire.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.878
I guess terrorists
get bored, too.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.529
Here's the file.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.350
Hola, mis hermanos.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.419
Get the package in position.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.521
Wait for my order to detonate.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.722
I repeat:

20:46.746 --> 20:49.925
Do not detonate
until you hear from me.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.427
Buena suerte.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.463
I'm guessing by "package,"
he means "bomb."

20:54.487 --> 20:55.831
Yeah.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.666
Well, look at the bright side.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.101
If there's a bomb out there,

20:59.125 --> 21:01.437
with Corporal Vega dead,
we've bought some time.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.273
I'm afraid not as much
as you might think.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.542
Here.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.057
Uh, I need to talk to Gibbs.

21:13.372 --> 21:14.683
The cause of death

21:14.707 --> 21:15.918
was as we expected.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.110
Multiple traumas
caused by the...

21:21.214 --> 21:23.292
Uh, uh, sorry, um...

21:23.316 --> 21:26.128
Agent DiNozzo actually
invited me to, to, um...

21:26.152 --> 21:27.396
It's not important.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.630
Um, won't happen again.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.466
Yes, well...

21:30.490 --> 21:33.235
dismemberment was
the cause of death.

21:33.259 --> 21:37.473
I found a wound
that-that predates the blast.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.107
It's a cigarette lighter?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.108
Yeah.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.743
It's the one from the car.

21:41.767 --> 21:45.614
And the angle suggests that
it was not self-inflicted.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.683
Oh, he wasn't
in the car alone, then?

21:47.707 --> 21:49.585
Well, whoever was there with him

21:49.609 --> 21:51.753
apparently got out of
the car at some point

21:51.777 --> 21:53.722
during the police chase.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.924
But that's not why
I called you down here.

21:55.948 --> 21:56.925
Mr. Palmer.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.994
I just sent some DNA up to Abby

21:59.018 --> 22:00.496
for positive identification,

22:00.520 --> 22:03.365
but before that,
we made a dental impression

22:03.389 --> 22:05.868
of the most perfect set
of teeth I've ever seen.

22:05.892 --> 22:06.969
Not a single cavity.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.203
No rotations.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.972
Had all of his wisdom teeth.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.829
Something Corporal Vega
did not have.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.746
This isn't Vega.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.882
Yeah, the corporal is alive

22:19.906 --> 22:22.484
to give whatever orders
he wishes,

22:22.508 --> 22:24.169
whenever he wishes.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.796
This isn't Corporal Vega?

22:34.820 --> 22:35.998
Then who is it?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.299
His name's John Cook.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.834
He's a former sergeant.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.970
Served briefly in the Second
Gulf War before being

22:41.994 --> 22:43.505
dishonorably discharged
for looting.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.008
Ducky finally found intact DNA.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.043
- Victim or involved?
- Involved.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.712
Abby lifted his prints off
of one of the bomb timers

22:50.736 --> 22:52.447
Tony and Ziva found
in the warehouse.

22:52.471 --> 22:55.551
So Cook makes the bombs, and
Vega gives the when and where.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.686
So, when and where?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.055
We're working on it.

23:00.079 --> 23:03.392
Unfortunately,
Cook was our best link to Vega.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.927
We've been doing
deep background,

23:04.951 --> 23:06.295
going through
credit card statements.

23:06.319 --> 23:08.297
So far,
nothing unusual shows up.

23:08.321 --> 23:10.189
- Back it up.
- Back it up.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.836
Dr. Mallard's report said
Cook had perfect teeth, right?

23:14.860 --> 23:16.171
That's right.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.330
These right here.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.978
Well, then why was he going
to a new dentist every two days?

23:23.002 --> 23:24.947
That does qualify as unusual.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.248
I'm gonna go find out.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.983
I have to brief
the Joint Chiefs.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.384
You have any idea

23:29.408 --> 23:31.486
how Vega plans
to relay the detonation orders?

23:31.510 --> 23:33.689
- Take your choice.
- Then we prepare for the worst.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.991
I've been told that the risk
of radiation exposure

23:36.015 --> 23:37.759
from a dirty bomb
is fairly negligible.

23:37.783 --> 23:40.429
Most of the injuries will be
from the explosion itself.

23:40.453 --> 23:43.665
But the real threat
to the city is panic.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.900
That's why they call
the dirty bombs

23:44.924 --> 23:46.902
weapons of mass disruption.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.438
When people get scared,
it gets deadly.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.940
Well, they are scared, Leon.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.375
Been having second thoughts

23:53.399 --> 23:56.211
about my testimony against
the defense contractor bill.

23:56.235 --> 23:59.762
Seemed like overkill...
yesterday.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.187
Oh, yes, I remember him.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.388
A walk-in.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.557
Showed up,
wanted his teeth cleaned.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.058
Then he left.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.927
Did you notice anything unusual?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.162
Only that he had
about the most perfect teeth

24:14.186 --> 24:15.430
I'd ever seen.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.767
We heard, from the last two
dentists we visited.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.202
Yeah.

24:20.226 --> 24:23.205
Well, working on him was...
almost orgasmic.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.507
Didn't really need to hear that.

24:25.531 --> 24:29.378
His retromolar pad was shaped
just like a Renaissance bosom.

24:29.402 --> 24:31.580
Okay. Uh...

24:31.604 --> 24:33.448
We're gonna go. Thank you.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.817
You think he had something to do
with the robbery?

24:35.841 --> 24:37.452
Robbery?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.254
Isn't that why you're here?

24:39.278 --> 24:42.324
Couple days later,
someone broke in.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.893
Thieves cleaned out
all our X-ray machines.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.261
How many exactly?

24:46.285 --> 24:48.063
Well, in the entire

24:48.087 --> 24:50.832
practice, uh... 15.

24:50.856 --> 24:53.335
And these weren't those cheap

24:53.359 --> 24:54.903
tube machines.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.727
These were top-of-the-line
cobalt-based units.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.807
Excuse me, Dr. Shore,

24:58.831 --> 25:00.509
you're needed in Room 1.

25:00.533 --> 25:03.278
Yes, I'm-I'm on my way.
Thank you.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.914
Uh... I have a patient waiting.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.015
Uh, is that all?

25:07.039 --> 25:08.684
No, that's all for now. Thanks.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.039
Thank you.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.790
Well, that explains
the credit card charges.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.925
Cook was casing
dentists' offices,

25:16.949 --> 25:17.993
looking for
radioactive material.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.128
At the dentist?

25:20.152 --> 25:22.898
It's a dirty secret
about dirty bombs.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.299
Sources are everywhere.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.333
Oil platforms,
medical equipment.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.968
There's too many
to keep track of.

25:26.992 --> 25:31.039
Is the cobalt of 15 machines
enough to make a dirty bomb?

25:31.063 --> 25:34.055
Once the material's powderized,
it's enough to make five.

25:35.634 --> 25:36.812
Five.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.847
Fantastic.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.515
You tell Gibbs.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.750
Okay, well, get back here.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.118
There's computery stuff
for you to do.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.986
And is set to
address the nation tonight.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.978
Tell Gibbs about what?

25:48.614 --> 25:49.958
You're still here. How nice.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.728
Told you I'm not leaving
until my client is released.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.197
Well, we could always have
security escort you out.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.798
The Transit Authority
is reporting gridlock

25:56.822 --> 25:58.533
- throughout the D.C. area...
- I was just

25:58.557 --> 26:00.402
playing with words... putting
them together in random orders.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.894
Uh, that is Gibbs' desk.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.410
Where is Mr. Gibbs?

26:08.434 --> 26:11.079
He hasn't left MTAC all day.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.781
I hope it's not because of me.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.016
It's probably more to do with
the impending terrorist attack

26:15.040 --> 26:16.084
your client is planning.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.652
Allegedly planning.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.488
And I was as surprised
as you were

26:19.512 --> 26:22.124
that he was still alive.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.993
Tell me something.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.828
Who cuts Mr. Gibbs' hair?

26:26.852 --> 26:28.163
Excuse me?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.632
I think you can tell
a lot about a man

26:30.656 --> 26:32.167
by who cuts his hair.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.503
Who cuts your hair?

26:34.527 --> 26:36.395
My sister.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.707
She has for years.

26:38.731 --> 26:42.344
I imagine you spend
more on your hair

26:42.368 --> 26:45.070
than it'd cost to feed
a Third World family for a year.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.151
How much does that cost?

26:49.175 --> 26:53.255
And Mr. Gibbs... well, I see him
getting his hair cut

26:53.279 --> 26:56.491
at the same mom-and-pop shop
he's been going to for years.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.760
Hey, get out of my chair.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.896
You talk to McGee?

27:00.920 --> 27:03.431
Uh, I... Yes.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.101
Um...

27:06.125 --> 27:07.402
Five.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.688
What's the plan?

27:12.698 --> 27:17.012
Oh, I would be happy to leave...

27:17.036 --> 27:19.781
as soon as you
release my client.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.017
Like I said before,
he's better off here.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.019
Is that how you justify
denying him

27:24.043 --> 27:25.587
his right of habeas corpus?

27:25.611 --> 27:27.722
That what I'm doing?

27:27.746 --> 27:29.648
You know what I can justify?

27:32.384 --> 27:36.431
Filing suit against NCIS
and you personally

27:36.455 --> 27:38.400
for violating over ten federal

27:38.424 --> 27:41.069
and state
constitutional protections.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.238
DiNozzo.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.773
Uh, calling security, yeah.

27:44.797 --> 27:45.991
Let him go.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.412
Let him go?

27:50.436 --> 27:51.880
You heard him.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.304
Release my client.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.699
Uh, releasing the client.

28:01.914 --> 28:05.160
I have a visual on the target.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.895
He's being cautious.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.630
This is the third place
he stopped

28:08.654 --> 28:10.723
after his lawyer
dropped him off at home.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.736
But the first time
he has sent his taxi away.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.671
Why do I get a funny feeling
Gibbs planned

28:16.695 --> 28:19.274
on using this guy as bait
from the beginning?

28:19.298 --> 28:21.027
Because he is Gibbs.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.414
Well, I sure hope I'm not around

28:26.438 --> 28:30.552
when Ms. Hart finds out
he used her client as bait.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.120
Or maybe I do.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.356
This is
all assuming the brothers had

28:34.380 --> 28:35.857
a prearranged meeting place.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.225
He's here.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.227
Mm-hmm, yes,
we should think positive.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.029
No. I mean, he's here.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.532
Right in front of me,
coming out the door.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.501
All right, let's take him.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.959
- I screwed up; It's my fault.
- All right...

28:50.896 --> 28:51.954
NCIS! Freeze!

28:53.065 --> 28:54.976
He said freeze!

28:55.000 --> 28:57.379
You're making a mistake.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.114
Really? Good.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.766
I know some place quaint
we can talk.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.564
I told your agents

29:16.588 --> 29:18.233
I want to talk to my lawyer.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.734
Yeah.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.137
She's on her way.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.629
So you can't ask me
any questions.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.996
That is right.

29:34.873 --> 29:37.052
You know you got the wrong guy.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.873
I am not a terrorist.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.892
Hola, mis hermanos.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.894
Get the package in position.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.586
Wait for my order to detonate.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.199
I can explain that.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.088
I can't wait.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.869
All right,
screw the lawyer. I...

30:10.409 --> 30:13.021
What is that?

30:13.045 --> 30:15.036
An attorney waiver.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.101
What is the matter
with you, Marine?!

30:26.125 --> 30:27.922
- I'm being set up.
- By who?

30:28.994 --> 30:30.705
Look, I don't know
his real name.

30:30.729 --> 30:33.441
He said he worked
for the Department of Defense.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.644
Said they needed native
Spanish speakers to perform

30:36.668 --> 30:38.146
in a top secret training video.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.281
That him?

30:40.305 --> 30:41.449
That's him.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.084
Well, he does not
work for the DOD.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.520
He had all the credentials.

30:45.544 --> 30:46.921
He took me to this building.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.791
It was set up to look
like a terrorist hideout.

30:49.815 --> 30:53.361
I recorded all kinds of messages
for the video.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.864
Uh, bioterror,
dirty bomb attacks.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.633
Hell, I even did
a militia insurrection.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.135
- It was all fake.
- Not all.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.184
- It was supposed to be!
- Well, it wasn't!

31:07.800 --> 31:09.744
A few days later, I noticed
somebody was following me.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.913
So I got suspicious,

31:11.937 --> 31:14.482
and I started asking around
about the training program.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.633
No one had heard about it.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.021
I knew I was in trouble.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.023
And you go hire a lawyer

31:22.047 --> 31:23.425
instead of going
to your superior?

31:23.449 --> 31:24.993
Look, I didn't know
who to trust.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.961
I read an article
about this woman.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.430
Heard that she helps people
like me.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.031
We played phone tag for a while,

31:30.055 --> 31:32.133
but before we could talk,
my recruiter shows up,

31:32.157 --> 31:35.470
and he sticks a gun in my back,
and he says, "Drive."

31:35.494 --> 31:36.938
Luckily, I saw a cop.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.907
I blew a stop sign
to get his attention.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.675
I bailed in an alley
during the chase.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.844
My recruiter had no choice
but to keep on going.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.045
I called my brother,

31:44.069 --> 31:46.714
and then I heard the explosion
right after.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.516
And then what,
you just play dead

31:48.540 --> 31:50.785
until you figure out
what else to do?

31:50.809 --> 31:52.743
Do you believe me?

31:56.949 --> 31:58.626
Well, you better.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.029
Because whatever terrorist
attack they're planning,

32:01.053 --> 32:03.112
I don't know a thing about it.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.075
Yeah, well,

32:14.099 --> 32:15.110
the cell records do confirm

32:15.134 --> 32:16.744
the game of phone tag
with the lawyer,

32:16.768 --> 32:18.813
and, uh, we found traces
of blood on the street

32:18.837 --> 32:20.582
where Vega said
he leapt from the car.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.117
His blood?

32:22.141 --> 32:23.718
Down to the last chromosome.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.278
What about the trips to Peru?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.627
Looks like pleasure,
not business.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.329
Her name is...

32:34.353 --> 32:38.700
Gloria García Ramírez
de Arroyo Fuentes.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.502
She's a nurse in Lima.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.137
There's no way he's our guy.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.771
Not a suicide bomber
in the world

32:43.795 --> 32:46.732
who'd have a girlfriend
looks like that.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.878
Unless, you know,
your gut says otherwise.

32:49.902 --> 32:51.927
He said he was set up.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.184
Libertad Nueva needed
a fall guy.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.087
And Corporal Vega
fit the profile.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.956
Well, I guess we can assume
the upcoming attack's real.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.859
It's too bad we lost
our number one suspect.

33:04.883 --> 33:07.128
The dentist.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.763
I sent a forensic team
to his place.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.965
Assistant said he left
for lunch after our visit,

33:10.989 --> 33:12.066
never returned.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.902
- Get a BOLO.
- Already out.

33:13.926 --> 33:16.171
That's not why I came down here.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.772
You have to see this.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.073
Received verification

33:19.097 --> 33:20.575
from several sources,

33:20.599 --> 33:21.976
and now ZNN can confirm

33:22.000 --> 33:25.213
the message was e-mailed
to our Washington bureau chief.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.482
It warns that,
unless the U.S. agrees

33:27.506 --> 33:29.484
to halt its anti-drug operations
in Peru,

33:29.508 --> 33:31.286
Libertad Nueva is going to blow

33:31.310 --> 33:34.222
one dirty bomb per day
in the DC metro area,

33:34.246 --> 33:35.857
starting in one hour.

33:35.881 --> 33:38.059
Homeland Security is advising
people to stay home.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.128
Panic is the greater threat
at this time.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.863
Ziva, I need a copy
of that e-mail now.

33:41.887 --> 33:42.897
- On it.
- DiNozzo...

33:42.921 --> 33:44.566
You need to talk
to the Metro PD chief.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.000
Hey, McGee, find the dentist.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.001
Already on it.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.170
Gibbs, tell me
you got something.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.505
Joint Chiefs want a sit-rep now.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.639
What can I give them?

33:51.663 --> 33:52.707
Not Roman Vega.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.509
I heard. What can I give you?

33:54.533 --> 33:55.577
Lawyer.

33:55.601 --> 33:56.844
Already banned her
from the building,

33:56.868 --> 33:58.413
but she's the least
of our concerns.

33:58.437 --> 33:59.847
We've already had
two traffic fatalities

33:59.871 --> 34:01.516
in the rush to get
out of the city.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.984
Do you have any leads
on the target?

34:03.008 --> 34:05.019
Boss, I think
I got something here.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.321
Our dentist may be MIA,

34:06.345 --> 34:08.389
but there's activity
on a site he belongs to

34:08.413 --> 34:09.690
called OralHappiness. Com,

34:09.715 --> 34:12.726
a social networking site
for oral care providers.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.330
Anyway, uploaded photos

34:15.353 --> 34:17.498
of a bus station off G Street.

34:17.522 --> 34:19.867
Either this guy has
a serious Greyhound fetish...

34:19.891 --> 34:21.369
Anybody else looking at these?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.837
Well, the photos
were recently viewed.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.138
It was from behind a firewall,

34:24.161 --> 34:26.007
but the IP address
is out of Peru.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.643
Must be how they're relaying
information on the target.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.225
Let's go. We're moving.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.853
Bomb squad's on their way.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.054
They're not going to make it.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.422
DiNozzo, Ziva,
coordinate with local LEOs.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.059
Evacuate the building,
but nobody leaves!

34:45.083 --> 34:46.793
All right, Gibbs.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.228
Radiation sensors.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.130
They only work
if the bomb's unshielded,

34:50.155 --> 34:51.165
but it's better than nothing.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.567
Hey, McGee,

34:52.591 --> 34:54.369
- come on, you're with me!
- Where we going?

34:54.393 --> 34:55.726
To find the bomb!

34:57.696 --> 34:59.073
Don't make me say it, McGee.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.088
We'll be careful, Tony.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.978
- Let's go!
- Move it!

35:04.002 --> 35:05.003
Move it!

35:09.374 --> 35:10.351
Hey, how much time?

35:10.375 --> 35:12.487
Less than five.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.788
What are we looking for?

35:13.812 --> 35:16.157
Uh... in a inside setting

35:16.181 --> 35:17.525
like this, something small.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.526
How small?

35:18.550 --> 35:21.053
Uh, briefcase, maybe smaller.

35:22.087 --> 35:23.431
Boss, it's somewhere over here,

35:23.455 --> 35:26.224
but something's
blocking the sensor.

35:27.492 --> 35:28.870
Boss, evacuation is complete.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.872
You want us to hold
our positions out here?

35:30.896 --> 35:32.158
Yeah, you stay outside.

35:33.432 --> 35:36.535
Gives a whole new spin
to "dirty bomb."

35:38.837 --> 35:40.099
Oh, boss?

35:49.348 --> 35:50.491
Lead-lined.

35:50.515 --> 35:51.926
That's why it was
blocking our sensor.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.461
You recognize the design?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.596
Not really, I mean,
I know the good old

35:55.620 --> 35:58.232
black and red wires...
probably supplies the power.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.435
We're going to have to do better
than a probably.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.203
Well, we definitely have
time to run.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.304
Then run.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.505
Well, the building's
been evacuated.

36:04.529 --> 36:05.807
We just let it blow.

36:05.831 --> 36:06.941
Go. Leave.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.976
Boss, the-the threat

36:09.000 --> 36:12.080
of contamination is minimal.

36:12.104 --> 36:14.115
Go! That's an order. Now, leave.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.471
It's an order I'm disobeying.

36:20.445 --> 36:22.824
Okay, if it's a tamper-resistant
circuit, we're dead,

36:22.848 --> 36:25.408
but I'd say cut the black...

36:33.258 --> 36:34.902
Well, I was going
to say black, but...

36:34.926 --> 36:36.723
guess red works.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.310
Actually, no, it didn't.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.611
McGee was right.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.013
There's a tamper-resistant
circuit.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.516
As soon as you cut
any of the wires,

36:48.540 --> 36:49.951
the bomb should have detonated.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.519
I'm still here, Abbs.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.522
The explosive
was mixed incorrectly.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.657
The first batch was
made too unstable,

36:56.681 --> 36:58.626
so it blew up
Roman Vega's trunk.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.962
I don't know,
I guess they overcompensated

37:00.986 --> 37:04.132
for the second batch,
made it too lean.

37:04.156 --> 37:07.301
These terrorists...
they get an A for terrorizing,

37:07.325 --> 37:09.704
but, gratefully,
an F in chemistry.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.272
Been over
the security tapes, boss.

37:11.296 --> 37:15.076
Whoever planted the bomb
knew to avoid the cameras.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.178
I vote for the dentist.

37:17.202 --> 37:20.114
Ever since Marathon Man,
I always vote for the dentist.

37:20.138 --> 37:21.349
Well, if it was him,

37:21.373 --> 37:23.117
that'll be the last bomb
he was planting.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.218
Look at this, boss.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.620
BOLO came back.

37:25.644 --> 37:29.157
Metro PD found his body
under the McGregor Bridge.

37:29.181 --> 37:30.625
They're calling it a suicide.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.627
Yep, left a note.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.429
Took credit for everything.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.430
Did he now?

37:35.454 --> 37:36.564
Guy disappears suspiciously.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.933
Then plants a bomb
for a terrorist group

37:38.957 --> 37:40.067
he has no connection to.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.469
Yeah, and then kills himself.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.304
I usually like things
all nice and tidy.

37:43.328 --> 37:45.306
It does not add up.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.642
Libertad Nueva has been
very careful up until now.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.578
Corporal Vega was
their original fall guy.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.337
Maybe they're improvising now.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.649
Despite calls for calm

37:54.673 --> 37:55.750
from several
government agencies,

37:55.774 --> 37:57.351
panic has engulfed the city.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.653
What about the other four bombs?

37:58.677 --> 38:01.589
Traffic through
the entire tristate area.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.524
Gibbs, if you're wrong
about this,

38:03.548 --> 38:05.359
we're putting a lot
of lives in jeopardy.

38:05.383 --> 38:06.360
I'm not.

38:06.384 --> 38:08.496
I got here as quick as I could.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.511
Thank you.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.071
As our resident
Libertad Nueva expert,

38:17.095 --> 38:19.440
I wanted to get your take
on something before I went

38:19.464 --> 38:21.742
to the Joint Chiefs.

38:21.766 --> 38:24.245
Next bomb's set to go off
in 12 hours.

38:24.269 --> 38:28.282
To prepare, Agent Gibbs thinks
that we should do nothing.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.585
Nothing?

38:30.609 --> 38:33.187
Not gonna be another bomb.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.922
Yeah, he says it's all for show.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.691
LN isn't given
to making idle threats.

38:36.715 --> 38:37.909
What's the endgame?

38:38.917 --> 38:40.862
The Senate is set

38:40.886 --> 38:43.064
to vote on
a new defense bill tonight.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.600
It's a terrible bill;
It was never going to pass.

38:45.624 --> 38:49.270
Gave away billions in pork
to defense contractors.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.305
But now, after the attacks,

38:51.329 --> 38:54.075
looks like it might go through.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.210
What, you think
Libertad Nueva is trying

38:56.234 --> 38:57.478
to influence the Senate vote?

38:57.502 --> 38:59.493
No, you are.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.783
Did some checking.
Your company stands to

39:02.807 --> 39:05.453
make tens of millions of dollars
if that bill should pass.

39:05.477 --> 39:08.222
You know, the funny thing
about all the intel we got

39:08.246 --> 39:12.827
on Libertad Nueva is
it comes from your company.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.830
All we could verify
independently of the group

39:15.854 --> 39:17.798
was a kid with a Web site.

39:17.822 --> 39:19.734
13-year-old kid.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.570
You know, it's not unheard of
for somebody in your position to

39:22.594 --> 39:25.239
amplify things
for their own personal gain.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.141
People get scared,
they make bad decisions.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.277
You were counting on it.

39:29.301 --> 39:30.845
You cooked the intelligence.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.080
You created a fake sleeper cell.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.448
No senator would ever vote

39:34.472 --> 39:36.784
against any defense bill
at threat level red.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.619
Oh, this is ridiculous.

39:38.643 --> 39:39.905
Sit down.

39:48.853 --> 39:50.331
Our people traced the IP address

39:50.355 --> 39:53.034
that uploaded
the bus station photos.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.202
Came from a computer
in your office.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.805
You did your best
to camouflage it.

39:57.829 --> 40:01.287
Well, I guess we just have
better nerds than you do.

40:05.070 --> 40:08.649
You cop to it now, right now,

40:08.673 --> 40:11.118
you let me get
this city off alert,

40:11.142 --> 40:14.202
I'll ask the attorney general
to waive the death penalty.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.292
You got ten seconds.

40:18.316 --> 40:21.195
After that, you can start
thinking about which vein

40:21.219 --> 40:23.551
you want us
to shut you off with.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.021
Five seconds.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.042
I'll need to talk
to my lawyers first.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.226
Oh, yeah, I bet you do.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.248
We finally traced the photos
from the bus station.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.638
They came from a computer
in Kane's office.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.914
You were bluffing.

40:52.384 --> 40:53.652
Cuff him.

41:11.269 --> 41:14.215
Am I the only one
who needs a warrant?

41:14.239 --> 41:16.017
Door was unlocked.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.736
Well, that's going to end soon.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.723
How dare you use
my client as bait.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.959
Your client was lying to me.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.627
He knew how to find his brother.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.562
He was protecting his brother.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.965
Roman was innocent,
in case you didn't notice.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.633
Well, then he didn't
need protection.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.503
Oh, is that how it works?

41:35.527 --> 41:37.872
You never put
the wrong guy away?

41:37.896 --> 41:40.592
And you've never helped
the wrong guy get away?

41:48.273 --> 41:50.418
That's a very nice suit
you're wearing.

41:50.442 --> 41:53.320
Roman Vega isn't going
to pay for that.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.923
It's scum like
Colonel Bell that do.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.992
Everyone is entitled
to a defense.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.261
Yeah, but you don't have
to be the one to do it.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.796
I guess with rates like yours,

42:01.820 --> 42:03.631
you don't ask
too many questions.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.800
I do plenty of pro bono work.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.568
Yeah, you know what?
I checked into that.

42:07.592 --> 42:11.172
You get... oh, I don't know...
maybe five requests a week,

42:11.196 --> 42:13.441
but the only ones you seem to do

42:13.465 --> 42:16.577
are the ones that take you
across my path.

42:16.601 --> 42:19.080
Are you really that conceited?

42:19.104 --> 42:20.648
You're standing in my house!

42:20.672 --> 42:22.583
You didn't know anything
about Roman Vega's case,

42:22.607 --> 42:24.452
but you took him on
as a client anyway.

42:24.476 --> 42:25.586
He needed help.

42:25.610 --> 42:29.356
You knew that it was
going to land you...

42:29.380 --> 42:30.691
in front of me.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.461
Don't flatter yourself.

42:33.485 --> 42:37.498
Yet here you are... again.

42:37.522 --> 42:39.166
I have my reasons.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.935
Yeah?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.154
And I have a job to do.

42:44.863 --> 42:47.957
And you keep getting in the way.
