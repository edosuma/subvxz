[breathing]

01:07.073 --> 01:09.604
[gasps]

01:09.606 --> 01:12.475
[static buzzing]

01:38.773 --> 01:41.471
And you say you have
no memory of anything?

01:41.473 --> 01:47.138
Nothing. I remember telling Eddie
we needed sugar, that's all.

01:47.140 --> 01:50.505
Eddie?
You mean Edward, your husband?

01:50.507 --> 01:52.174
Yes.

01:53.306 --> 01:55.204
Husband's body
is with the coroner.

01:55.206 --> 01:56.670
Looks like a heart attack.

01:56.672 --> 01:59.239
Doctor's outside
waiting to have a word.

01:59.241 --> 02:04.738
- And you were gardening?
- Yes. I mean, I think I...

02:04.740 --> 02:09.239
Please, just try your best
to remember, Mrs. Royce.

02:09.241 --> 02:12.604
I've told you, I don't know.

02:12.606 --> 02:15.140
I can't remember.

02:16.774 --> 02:20.041
I'm afraid that's not
very helpful, Mrs. Royce.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.640
Harris.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.304
Yes?

02:29.306 --> 02:32.171
She's still shaken.
Let's give her some time.

02:32.173 --> 02:34.505
I'm being thorough,
that's all.

02:34.507 --> 02:36.039
We don't have time.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.704
You heard her,
she forgets more and more.

02:37.706 --> 02:39.571
Harris, her old man's died.

02:39.573 --> 02:42.372
Probably because he's an old man.
It's as simple as that.

02:42.374 --> 02:43.738
Let's wrap this up.

02:43.740 --> 02:47.105
- Don't you think we should...
- He's tried.

02:47.107 --> 02:49.072
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I do hope you're not planning

02:49.074 --> 02:52.371
on keeping my patient
in there any longer.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.670
Dr. Joanne Hill,
Mrs. Royce's doctor.

02:54.672 --> 02:57.438
- She has had rather a night.
- Haven't we all?

02:57.440 --> 03:00.805
[Joanne] I did actually encourage her
to stop driving a few months ago,

03:00.807 --> 03:03.304
but she just drove off into town
and forget what she'd came for.

03:03.306 --> 03:04.737
I mean,
she's completely harmless

03:04.739 --> 03:07.670
but driving licenses
are a bit of a gray area

03:07.672 --> 03:09.406
with dementia patients.

03:09.408 --> 03:11.105
It's OK, I'll take her home.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.372
- Barnes.
- What?

03:13.374 --> 03:15.470
Isn't it your anniversary?

03:15.472 --> 03:17.404
Shit.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.570
It's OK, I'm almost done.

03:18.572 --> 03:21.438
I'll take Mrs. Royce home.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.107
Go, go home to Sara, go.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.473
After you.

03:35.306 --> 03:38.674
Hey.
I knew you'd still be here.

03:40.639 --> 03:42.771
You know you just
assaulted a detective.

03:42.773 --> 03:44.604
Need to get you
down to the station.

03:44.606 --> 03:46.304
Come on,
I'm dragging you home.

03:46.306 --> 03:49.305
I will, but I've just
got to finish this up.

03:49.307 --> 03:53.139
- Then I'm all yours.
- Ryan, it's our anniversary.

03:53.141 --> 03:56.537
I know.
And I love you more than ever.

03:56.539 --> 03:59.705
Come on, give me half an hour.
I promise.

03:59.707 --> 04:03.470
Half an hour.
All right, it better be,

04:03.472 --> 04:05.570
or else I'll be locking you up.

04:05.572 --> 04:08.172
Oh, really?

04:08.174 --> 04:09.571
Are you mad?

04:09.573 --> 04:11.504
Eat some bread, will ya?

04:11.506 --> 04:14.305
Mike Evans.
Disorderly again.

04:14.307 --> 04:18.041
And I can't put him in the cells
'cause they're flooded, so...

04:22.707 --> 04:24.172
Mike.

04:24.174 --> 04:26.072
What we gonna do with you?

04:26.074 --> 04:27.705
I know things are tough
with your daughter

04:27.707 --> 04:29.570
and her transplant
but this isn't helping.

04:29.572 --> 04:31.305
I'm OK.

04:31.307 --> 04:34.041
Just need to go home
and sleep it off, all right?

04:38.472 --> 04:41.640
Yep, all right, fine.
Go on, let him go.

04:47.439 --> 04:48.741
Stay out of trouble.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.570
And leave your truck
where it is.

04:51.572 --> 04:53.573
A walk will do you good.

04:56.706 --> 04:59.574
All right, what do I got left?

05:12.440 --> 05:14.072
Do you have
any anniversary cards?

05:14.074 --> 05:15.241
Over there.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.741
Two-thirty.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.008
[vehicle zooms by]

05:38.439 --> 05:39.606
Cheers.

05:40.472 --> 05:42.041
[door shuts]

[woman on TV indistinct]

06:07.173 --> 06:10.040
[phone buzzing]

06:23.439 --> 06:28.471
[voicemail] <i>Message
received today at 9:15 p.m.</i>

06:28.473 --> 06:30.370
[Sara]
<i>Hey, when are you coming home?</i>

06:30.372 --> 06:32.671
<i>You said you'd be back
nearly an hour ago.</i>

06:32.673 --> 06:36.038
<i>Also, I can't remember if you said
you liked salt or sweet popcorn.</i>

06:36.040 --> 06:38.704
<i>Isn't that awful?
Married six years,</i>

06:38.706 --> 06:41.105
<i>and I still don't know
what popcorn you like.</i>

06:41.107 --> 06:42.005
[engine revving]

06:42.007 --> 06:43.537
- <i>Anyway, I...</i>
- [tires squealing]

[Velcro ripping]

07:23.439 --> 07:25.507
[gasps]

07:27.240 --> 07:28.741
Good afternoon.

07:42.273 --> 07:43.571
How long have I been out?

07:43.573 --> 07:45.441
Couple of hours.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.804
Look like you need
a couple more.

07:48.806 --> 07:50.506
Yeah.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.238
You know, you don't need
to be here all the time.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.474
We can look after her.

08:21.306 --> 08:23.370
Do you know who left this?

08:23.372 --> 08:24.707
No.

08:46.372 --> 08:47.704
[Ryan] Anything?

08:47.706 --> 08:50.270
[man] <i>They're cut and dry.</i>

08:50.272 --> 08:52.038
So he just keeled over.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.039
[man]
<i>That's what the medic thinks.</i>

08:54.041 --> 08:57.574
<i>Seen it before.
Must have been the excitement.</i>

08:59.607 --> 09:02.641
Yeah, I thought fishing
was supposed to be relaxing.

09:26.072 --> 09:27.103
[car door shuts]

09:27.105 --> 09:28.171
Morning.

09:28.173 --> 09:29.571
[Ryan] Who is it?

09:29.573 --> 09:32.771
Jack Dowling,
collapsed while fishing.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.103
Do I need to go down there?

09:35.105 --> 09:36.070
I'll sign it off.

09:36.072 --> 09:37.740
Come on, I'll buy you a coffee.

09:40.373 --> 09:42.741
[dinging]

09:49.707 --> 09:52.538
My old man used to fish.

09:52.540 --> 09:54.772
I never really saw the point.

09:54.774 --> 09:58.140
Just sitting there waiting
for something to happen.

10:01.473 --> 10:03.006
You look rough.

10:08.572 --> 10:10.173
I found this.

10:12.305 --> 10:13.707
In Sara's room.

10:22.774 --> 10:25.038
I understand why you're angry.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.570
I get it.

10:27.572 --> 10:31.270
When my old man died,
my mum, she cried for days

10:31.272 --> 10:32.973
because he left her.

10:33.706 --> 10:36.037
You can't let it eat at you.

10:36.039 --> 10:39.571
You can't think that
everyone is against you.

10:39.573 --> 10:41.107
This...

10:42.173 --> 10:44.040
It's just a lost book.

10:52.039 --> 10:55.071
Maybe you should take
some more time off.

10:55.073 --> 10:56.441
What do you think?

11:05.472 --> 11:07.106
[man] Barnes?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.437
So they put it down
to a heart attack.

11:15.439 --> 11:17.606
You look confused.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.670
Maybe I am.

11:21.672 --> 11:25.037
- [sirens wailing]
- [woman] What do you need, Ryan?

11:25.039 --> 11:27.038
I just need to know if there
have been any other visitors

11:27.040 --> 11:28.571
in the past couple days
besides me or family?

11:28.573 --> 11:31.037
Not that I know of.
I'm not aware of this.

11:31.039 --> 11:33.705
- Just give me the records.
- I can't access the records.

11:33.707 --> 11:36.505
Ryan, stop, I can't...
I'm trying to help you!

11:36.507 --> 11:39.441
- Jessica, please!
- Ryan.

11:41.239 --> 11:43.174
I want to know who wrote this.

11:45.139 --> 11:49.073
I understand you're upset but you
can't just go barging in here.

11:49.707 --> 11:51.641
Get me the records, Jessica.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.174
[beeping]

12:06.272 --> 12:07.337
[man] I want to see her.

12:07.339 --> 12:09.037
Where is she? Where is she?

12:09.039 --> 12:11.638
- Get security, Daniel.
- Go home, Mike, you're drunk.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.705
No, you don't, where is she?
Is it this one, eh?

12:13.707 --> 12:16.571
Or this one?
Well, where is she?

12:16.573 --> 12:19.505
Well, you lot can't help us so I'm
taking her somewhere that can.

12:19.507 --> 12:21.571
Oh, so now
you want to help her?

12:21.573 --> 12:23.371
Do you realize what
she went through

12:23.373 --> 12:24.670
when you were in prison?

12:24.672 --> 12:26.638
You're a terrible father, Mike.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.704
Don't make this worse
than you already have.

12:28.706 --> 12:32.240
- Just go...
- Stay away from me, will ya?

12:36.173 --> 12:37.574
Holly.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.705
It's Daddy, come with Daddy.

12:41.707 --> 12:43.470
I don't want any trouble.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.771
I just want to see my daughter.

12:44.773 --> 12:48.271
- Michael...
- Come on, come with Daddy.

12:48.273 --> 12:49.471
[Michael] Holly.

12:49.473 --> 12:50.772
[woman]
Holly, stay where you are, baby.

12:50.774 --> 12:53.438
You cannot stop me
from helping my daughter.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.471
Holly.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.238
He just assaulted a patient.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.673
You're leaving.

13:01.472 --> 13:04.038
Dad...

13:04.040 --> 13:05.540
Just go.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.171
[banging]

13:19.173 --> 13:21.171
[gasps]

13:21.173 --> 13:23.007
[Michael yelling]

13:25.407 --> 13:27.038
Get off me!

13:27.040 --> 13:29.507
[siren blaring]

13:33.205 --> 13:34.470
That's how you deal with things,

13:34.472 --> 13:36.103
have another pop
if it makes you feel better.

13:36.105 --> 13:37.173
Yeah?

13:39.472 --> 13:41.570
Say something else.

13:41.572 --> 13:42.771
Go on, say one more thing.

13:42.773 --> 13:45.470
I just want
to see my daughter.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.605
She's in there.
She needs me.

13:47.607 --> 13:51.538
My wife's in a fucking
coma because of you!

13:51.540 --> 13:54.338
Leave me alone, will ya?

13:54.340 --> 13:55.570
Ryan!

13:55.572 --> 13:57.170
Ryan, please stop.

13:57.172 --> 13:58.204
Get him off me!

13:58.206 --> 14:00.271
[grunts]

14:00.273 --> 14:01.674
Ryan!

14:03.305 --> 14:05.304
What the fuck are you doing?

14:05.306 --> 14:07.174
Leave now!

14:09.472 --> 14:11.473
[mumbling]

14:13.305 --> 14:14.973
All right?

14:32.406 --> 14:34.304
- Are you stupid?
- What?

14:34.306 --> 14:37.506
I can't keep clearing up after
you every time you go for him.

14:39.272 --> 14:43.070
I was with Sara, he was here,
so I dealt with it.

14:43.072 --> 14:44.304
You dealt with it.

14:44.306 --> 14:46.071
That's you dealing with it,
is it?

14:46.073 --> 14:47.705
He files a report
and you're suspended.

14:47.707 --> 14:50.104
Do you understand that?

14:50.106 --> 14:52.007
Do you understand?

14:53.606 --> 14:55.574
Don't worry about me.

15:46.172 --> 15:47.973
[man] How's Sara?

15:50.039 --> 15:51.672
She's the same.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.570
You don't have to ask every day.

16:00.572 --> 16:02.071
- [radio static]
- [man] Yeah?

16:02.073 --> 16:03.337
[man on radio]
<i>We've got a situation</i>

16:03.339 --> 16:04.338
<i>over at the Royce's house.</i>

16:04.340 --> 16:05.405
[man] We're on our way.

16:05.407 --> 16:08.140
[indistinct radio chatter]

16:35.205 --> 16:37.138
[man] We called the water board
to shut off the pipes.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.338
Her neighbor said the water
was pouring down the path.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.703
That's when he found her.

16:40.705 --> 16:43.037
Water was coming from
an outside tap over there.

16:43.039 --> 16:45.438
He turned it off
and called it in.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.039
Apart from that,
no one's touched a thing.

16:49.705 --> 16:52.304
Two bodies in two days.

16:52.306 --> 16:54.371
Bit of a coincidence.

16:54.373 --> 16:56.337
Could just be
old age though, right?

16:56.339 --> 16:59.706
Let's just wait for the coroner's report.
She's on her way.

17:00.573 --> 17:03.170
You all right with this?

17:03.172 --> 17:05.405
Yeah.

17:05.406 --> 17:07.069
Last time I saw her was...

17:07.071 --> 17:08.804
[man] Was the night
of Sara's accident.

17:08.806 --> 17:12.337
She didn't know what day of the
week it was then, poor old girl.

17:12.339 --> 17:14.170
Maybe this was for the best, eh?

17:14.172 --> 17:16.571
Poor choice of words.

17:19.806 --> 17:24.569
She could have slipped,
knocked herself out.

17:24.571 --> 17:27.203
No wounds
from the fall though.

17:27.204 --> 17:29.203
There's no signs
of a struggle either.

17:29.205 --> 17:33.239
- [man] I'd say natural causes.
- Thank you, doctor.

17:36.239 --> 17:39.371
There's a small puncture
at the back of her neck.

17:39.373 --> 17:40.672
What?

17:42.738 --> 17:45.704
Could be nothing
but it's worth looking into.

17:45.706 --> 17:49.203
Harris, request a
full toxicology report

17:49.205 --> 17:51.441
on both the Royce's.

17:57.439 --> 17:59.203
Found this in the kitchen.

17:59.205 --> 18:02.507
It was open on today's date.
Thought it might be useful.

18:16.571 --> 18:19.536
Same thing every day.

18:19.538 --> 18:21.570
It's just the same thing.

18:21.572 --> 18:25.506
Prayers, pensions,
see doctor, shopping.

18:28.039 --> 18:30.736
Page after page.

18:30.738 --> 18:33.739
[man] When we found her,
she barely knew her own name.

18:38.406 --> 18:40.539
Why go to the doctor's
every day?

18:41.472 --> 18:43.973
Want to pay Hill a visit?

18:46.571 --> 18:49.139
No, let's go see
Mrs. Dowling first.

18:50.471 --> 18:53.171
Great, Mrs. Dowling.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.238
I don't understand.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.603
They told me yesterday
Jack had a heart attack.

18:57.605 --> 18:59.771
[man] Yes. The medics think
that was the reason

18:59.773 --> 19:02.038
you husband drowned
in the river.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.569
However...

19:04.571 --> 19:08.037
Look, there's been
a series of heart attacks.

19:08.039 --> 19:10.640
We'd appreciate
any help you can give us.

19:11.738 --> 19:13.569
Did you notice
anything odd at all,

19:13.571 --> 19:16.570
leading up to your
husband's death?

19:16.572 --> 19:19.570
He wasn't a well man
towards the end.

19:19.572 --> 19:22.174
I'm sure he would
have welcomed it.

19:23.173 --> 19:26.437
He drank and smoked
since he was a boy.

19:26.439 --> 19:31.240
Thinking about it now, I'm surprised he
didn't have a heart attack 10 years ago.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.371
Perhaps you'd better
ask Dale Jacobs.

19:35.373 --> 19:37.237
Why?

19:37.239 --> 19:42.073
Dale always went fishing with Jack.
He was there that day.

19:47.306 --> 19:50.439
I presume you knew that,
detectives?

19:52.438 --> 19:54.439
Thanks for your help.

20:01.438 --> 20:03.673
The report said
he was on his own.

20:09.172 --> 20:11.238
Okay, great, thanks.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.737
Dale Jacobs lives at Lemington
Drive with his granddaughter.

20:14.739 --> 20:15.704
Amanda.

20:15.706 --> 20:19.107
Yeah. You know her?

20:20.173 --> 20:22.107
We were friends growing up.

20:23.538 --> 20:26.570
Are you sure they closed the
path to the Royce's back garden?

20:26.572 --> 20:29.470
Single officers on duty
until we know...

20:29.472 --> 20:31.440
Got it.

20:46.039 --> 20:48.137
- Bring her out!
- Granddad, please.

20:48.139 --> 20:50.304
- Bring her out!
- Please, Granddad.

20:50.306 --> 20:51.673
Dale?

20:55.471 --> 20:57.436
Who are you?

20:57.438 --> 20:59.703
It's Ryan.
This is Detective Harris.

20:59.705 --> 21:02.138
- Can you put that down, please?
- Right.

21:02.140 --> 21:04.504
Well, there's a
strange woman in there,

21:04.506 --> 21:06.570
and she won't let me
see my wife.

21:06.572 --> 21:08.436
Let's see if we can
sort it out.

21:08.438 --> 21:10.137
Just put that down first.

21:10.139 --> 21:13.204
Ryan, please don't worry,
he's just confused.

21:13.206 --> 21:17.171
Granddad, Granny went
a long time ago, OK?

21:17.173 --> 21:19.238
Please, Dale, just relax.

21:19.240 --> 21:24.140
I'll fucking relax
when you find my wife!

21:26.406 --> 21:27.737
My wife.

21:27.739 --> 21:31.203
Ruth. I was at the funeral.

21:31.205 --> 21:33.007
You remember, it's me, Ryan.

21:36.239 --> 21:38.106
Yeah.

21:44.273 --> 21:46.107
Amanda?

21:47.772 --> 21:49.670
I'm here, it's OK, Granddad.

21:49.672 --> 21:52.303
- What did I do?
- It's OK, it's OK.

21:52.305 --> 21:54.803
- What did I do?
- Doesn't matter.

21:54.805 --> 21:58.569
We wanted to ask you about your
fishing trips with Jack Dowling.

21:58.571 --> 22:02.539
- Jack?
- Is everything OK?

22:04.639 --> 22:07.174
Kim, can you go inside, please?

22:09.205 --> 22:10.704
[door shuts]

22:10.706 --> 22:14.302
He had a heart attack.
He was found dead by the lake.

22:14.304 --> 22:16.436
[breathing heavily]

22:16.438 --> 22:20.037
Ryan, I need my inhaler.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.103
It's in the car.

22:22.105 --> 22:25.039
- You sure?
- Yeah. He's fine, go on.

22:31.172 --> 22:33.537
[Harris] Mrs. Dowling told us
that Dale was there too,

22:33.539 --> 22:35.404
so we just came to
ask a few questions.

22:35.406 --> 22:39.303
He was meant to go but he had
a bad turn that morning.

22:39.305 --> 22:41.103
Took some time to calm him down.

22:41.105 --> 22:42.771
And he spent all day
in his chair.

22:42.773 --> 22:44.470
How long has he
been like this?

22:44.472 --> 22:46.804
Couple of years now.
Usually, it's manageable

22:46.806 --> 22:49.536
but every now and then,
he has these outbreaks.

22:49.538 --> 22:52.436
The tablets just don't
do anything anymore.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.038
[car engine starting]

22:54.040 --> 22:55.137
Granddad, wait!

22:55.139 --> 22:57.171
Ryan, he's not supposed
to drive.

22:57.173 --> 22:59.437
- Stay here, I'll go.
- Please, make sure he's OK.

22:59.439 --> 23:01.570
He really wouldn't hurt anyone.

23:01.572 --> 23:03.740
[tires squealing]

23:27.204 --> 23:28.706
Shit.

24:22.439 --> 24:24.040
Quite a view.

24:26.171 --> 24:27.707
I painted this once.

24:29.571 --> 24:34.106
Now my fingers don't hold the
paintbrush the way they used to.

24:36.171 --> 24:40.540
I can't even paint Amanda
a picture for her birthday.

24:52.039 --> 24:53.205
It's peaceful.

24:56.438 --> 24:58.639
I think we
take that for granted.

25:01.506 --> 25:08.270
"An hour is the sea
between others and me.

25:08.272 --> 25:11.973
With them would shelter be."

25:14.104 --> 25:18.369
I saw that written
on a pebble once.

25:18.371 --> 25:22.504
One of those things they sell
in the seaside gift shops.

25:22.506 --> 25:25.573
It's the small things
we remember.

25:32.706 --> 25:35.572
It's only gonna get
worse with me, you know.

25:36.438 --> 25:41.103
Medical bills, care homes.

25:41.105 --> 25:43.539
They're gonna be
feeding me like a baby.

25:47.739 --> 25:51.106
I just want to feel
important to someone.

25:55.171 --> 25:57.436
I'd be better off gone.

25:57.438 --> 25:59.740
If not for me,
at least for Amanda.

26:07.039 --> 26:10.672
Dale, I understand
what you're going through.

26:14.438 --> 26:16.439
After Sara, I just...

26:18.806 --> 26:21.707
I just stopped
talking about everything.

26:25.438 --> 26:26.605
At first, it was a...

26:28.239 --> 26:33.439
Made me feel bad, but then it
just became a way to get by.

26:42.538 --> 26:44.302
Listen...

26:44.304 --> 26:45.569
You have someone at home

26:45.571 --> 26:48.572
that loves you
and cares for you.

26:51.706 --> 26:55.436
So why don't you let me
take you home

26:55.438 --> 26:57.106
so she can see you?

27:00.406 --> 27:02.039
Okay?

27:15.239 --> 27:18.403
[Harris] Just give us a call
if you come across anything.

27:18.405 --> 27:20.469
You sure you're gonna be
all right on your own with him?

27:20.471 --> 27:24.269
- Yeah, we'll be fine.
- Okay.

27:24.271 --> 27:25.703
Thank you.

27:25.705 --> 27:30.337
- Detective...
- Oh, it's Harris.

27:30.339 --> 27:32.236
I'm new.

27:32.238 --> 27:33.238
I figured.

27:38.805 --> 27:41.369
Hey...

27:41.371 --> 27:43.703
Hello, sweetheart.

27:43.705 --> 27:47.038
Ryan, my collection, back here.

27:58.304 --> 27:59.570
This is my space.

27:59.572 --> 28:01.503
This is where I do my work.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.703
I got light, light, light,

28:03.705 --> 28:06.105
and it's where I do
all my paintings.

28:08.304 --> 28:09.473
This one?

28:13.772 --> 28:14.740
Here.

28:17.773 --> 28:19.302
You have this.

28:19.304 --> 28:20.771
It's a gift.

28:20.773 --> 28:22.436
I love it.

28:22.438 --> 28:24.605
Royce's will
is on its way over.

28:27.605 --> 28:29.669
Tell you what,
can you hold onto it for now?

28:29.671 --> 28:33.536
- Sure.
- Gives me an excuse to swing by.

28:33.538 --> 28:36.206
- Okay.
- It's beautiful.

28:46.304 --> 28:49.569
Both the Royce's recently
made changes to their wills.

28:49.571 --> 28:51.269
They had a joint bank account.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.737
They left most of their money
to the BCA.

28:53.739 --> 28:56.439
- The Blackrock Church Association.
- Correct.

28:57.304 --> 28:58.604
I've spoken to Dan's bank.

28:58.606 --> 29:01.403
He also recently made
donations to the church.

29:01.405 --> 29:02.670
There's more.

29:02.672 --> 29:05.302
This guy, Reverend James Shaw.

29:05.304 --> 29:08.706
Forced to leave his last parish
because of financial irregularities.

29:18.472 --> 29:19.703
Doesn't seem like
it's received

29:19.705 --> 29:21.606
a chunk of inheritance money.

29:23.171 --> 29:24.206
Hello?

29:27.339 --> 29:28.606
There's no one here.

29:38.304 --> 29:41.336
Every one of these
gold plaques has a name on it.

29:41.338 --> 29:44.302
Mr. and Mrs. Royce.
Jack Dowling.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.572
They've all got one.

29:47.172 --> 29:48.537
Can I help you?

29:48.539 --> 29:50.636
I'm afraid we're closed
for refurbishments.

29:50.638 --> 29:53.439
There's no service here
until the roof is done.

29:56.039 --> 29:59.206
- We're not here for service.
- Oh.

30:00.204 --> 30:01.771
Can I help you then?

30:01.773 --> 30:04.436
Detective Harris,
this is Detective Barnes.

30:04.438 --> 30:06.369
We're just chasing
a few inquiries.

30:06.371 --> 30:07.703
Mm-hmm.

30:07.705 --> 30:09.437
The people on these plaques,

30:09.439 --> 30:11.137
they've given money
to the church?

30:11.139 --> 30:13.603
That's right.
Benefactors have the privilege

30:13.605 --> 30:16.739
of having their name forever
on the memorial pillars.

30:17.705 --> 30:19.469
Did you have
a close relationship

30:19.471 --> 30:21.437
to all these people?

30:21.439 --> 30:23.802
I'm sorry,
why are you here again?

30:23.804 --> 30:25.706
Just asking some questions.

30:28.638 --> 30:31.570
[Harris] How well did you know
Mrs. Royce?

30:31.572 --> 30:33.470
She and Edward
were devoted worshipers

30:33.472 --> 30:35.506
since they retired to Blackrock.

30:37.338 --> 30:38.740
And Mr. Dowling?

30:39.805 --> 30:43.137
Tragic, but it
wasn't a surprise.

30:43.139 --> 30:45.537
The poor man
was riddled with problems.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.039
Was he not?

30:49.239 --> 30:51.370
Is that everything, gentlemen?

30:51.372 --> 30:53.540
Or can I help you
with anything else?

30:55.239 --> 30:56.606
No, that's it.

31:11.605 --> 31:14.205
How did Dowling's plaque
go up so quickly?

31:23.371 --> 31:24.706
What's that for?

31:26.006 --> 31:29.106
Let's get back to the office.
There's something I need to check.

31:33.606 --> 31:35.440
[Harris]
<i>What's this gonna prove?</i>

31:36.338 --> 31:37.437
Just pull it up.

31:37.439 --> 31:40.206
[clicking]

31:43.371 --> 31:47.138
[printer whirring]

31:50.205 --> 31:53.103
Remember the Royce's house
two days ago?

31:53.105 --> 31:55.670
This is their house
two years ago.

31:55.672 --> 31:57.738
[Harris] Yeah, so?

31:59.238 --> 32:00.639
Notice anything different?

32:03.039 --> 32:04.370
Scaffolding.

32:04.372 --> 32:06.536
[soft grunt]

32:06.538 --> 32:08.038
Mike Evans.

32:17.038 --> 32:19.369
We have an inebriated driver
coming in.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.238
Can you get
a cell ready, please?

32:24.172 --> 32:27.169
It was all so quick.
I just lost...

32:27.171 --> 32:29.337
Do you realize how many
people you could have killed?

32:29.339 --> 32:30.337
Get off me!

32:30.339 --> 32:31.569
The fuck are you on about?

32:31.571 --> 32:32.736
Do I even know you?

32:32.738 --> 32:36.203
Ryan!
He's not the drunk.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.573
She is.

32:39.606 --> 32:41.369
You need serious help, mate.

32:41.371 --> 32:43.269
For fuck's sake.

32:43.271 --> 32:44.539
Just book her in.

32:45.572 --> 32:46.739
You all right?

32:56.471 --> 32:58.604
What was all that about?

32:58.606 --> 33:00.173
Just forget it.

33:05.638 --> 33:07.540
You're lucky he cares.

33:08.539 --> 33:10.706
He wouldn't do that
for anyone else.

33:13.072 --> 33:14.238
Yeah, I know.

33:16.171 --> 33:21.103
So, I say tomorrow we wait
and see what the reverend does.

33:21.105 --> 33:23.169
Shall we get a man on him
and one on Mike Evans?

33:23.171 --> 33:26.536
Keep an eye on both? But we don't
have anything on the reverend yet.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.337
What about the plaques?
And the donations?

33:29.339 --> 33:30.702
Bollocks to them.

33:30.704 --> 33:33.671
We need hard evidence,
something concrete.

33:34.705 --> 33:36.070
I hope you're right

33:36.072 --> 33:37.369
and not just wanting
to focus on Evans

33:37.371 --> 33:38.572
because of what's going on.

33:39.704 --> 33:42.703
I've just had an interesting
conversation with the mayor.

33:42.705 --> 33:45.302
About the church...

33:45.304 --> 33:48.369
Cool off on the reverend unless
you've got something worthy.

33:48.371 --> 33:49.769
And if you do,
you bring it to me first.

33:49.771 --> 33:52.539
Otherwise this
investigation ends here.

33:53.538 --> 33:55.369
We think we might
have something.

33:55.371 --> 33:57.571
Think is not enough!

34:02.238 --> 34:03.738
[sighs]

34:13.405 --> 34:15.005
Wait.

34:17.039 --> 34:18.106
What?

34:25.072 --> 34:28.437
Didn't Dowling have an excess
of insulin in his blood?

34:28.438 --> 34:31.503
Yeah.
But he had diabetes.

34:31.505 --> 34:34.538
- And the Royce's?
- Same.

34:36.536 --> 34:38.172
Look at this.

34:44.271 --> 34:46.005
Mrs. Royce wasn't diabetic.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.440
There's our proof.

34:50.304 --> 34:52.469
Get a list straight away
of everyone who passed away

34:52.471 --> 34:54.137
in the last year
through diabetes.

34:54.139 --> 34:56.505
Confirm they all had
the insulin dose.

35:36.738 --> 35:41.568
[Harris] <i>So at the moment, we can
only prove Mrs. Royce was killed.</i>

35:41.570 --> 35:46.635
We need to try and link
both the Royce's to Dowling,

35:46.637 --> 35:49.770
otherwise it just looks like
they accidentally overdosed.

35:49.772 --> 35:52.671
With their age and diabetes,
it could hold up.

35:54.537 --> 35:57.337
The killer knows
the insulin covers it.

35:57.339 --> 35:58.703
I'll check the hospital

35:58.705 --> 36:00.703
and other areas
that store insulin.

36:00.705 --> 36:04.173
You think we should look into any
other beneficiaries of the church?

36:05.604 --> 36:07.536
Make a list.

36:07.538 --> 36:10.005
Let's not pin our hopes
on a killer priest.

36:12.172 --> 36:14.103
You still convinced
it's Evans?

36:14.105 --> 36:15.205
I don't know.

36:17.704 --> 36:20.038
He isn't this calculated.

36:27.538 --> 36:29.139
Busy, boys?

36:31.372 --> 36:33.136
Toxicology report, sir.

36:33.138 --> 36:35.538
It suggests we're
dealing with murders.

36:39.371 --> 36:42.536
We confirmed all the victims
had insulin in them.

36:42.538 --> 36:43.803
With their age
and health problems,

36:43.805 --> 36:46.103
it was just enough to kill 'em.

36:46.105 --> 36:49.703
Anyone young and healthy
and they could have survived.

36:49.705 --> 36:51.370
We know he's only
going after OAPs

36:51.372 --> 36:53.169
with ongoing health problems.

36:53.171 --> 36:55.671
Easy targets,
going after vulnerable.

36:57.071 --> 36:58.469
Impressive.

36:58.471 --> 36:59.803
Call me if you get anything.

36:59.805 --> 37:01.636
And both of you, have a shower.

37:01.638 --> 37:04.073
Smells like someone
died in here.

37:06.038 --> 37:07.173
Good work.

37:09.371 --> 37:10.705
Right.

38:03.238 --> 38:06.502
[voicemail]
<i>You have one saved message.</i>

38:06.504 --> 38:08.170
[Sara]
<i>Hey, when are you coming home?</i>

38:08.172 --> 38:10.502
<i>You said you'd be back
nearly an hour ago.</i>

38:10.504 --> 38:14.369
<i>Also, I can't remember if you said
you liked salt or sweet popcorn.</i>

38:14.371 --> 38:16.335
<i>Isn't that awful?</i>

38:16.337 --> 38:18.438
[beeping]

38:34.039 --> 38:35.539
Hey, Ryan.

38:36.505 --> 38:38.472
Got those records you asked for.

38:46.338 --> 38:48.703
No unexpected visitors.

38:48.705 --> 38:52.106
Just family, hospital staff,
and yourself.

38:55.303 --> 38:56.571
Thanks.

38:58.138 --> 38:59.471
Means a lot.

39:01.571 --> 39:04.036
Everyone's
looking out for you.

39:04.038 --> 39:05.538
Both of you.

39:07.605 --> 39:09.105
Yeah, I know.

39:13.671 --> 39:15.403
I'm sorry I flipped out.

39:15.405 --> 39:19.301
It's OK. I understand.

39:19.303 --> 39:21.102
I know what you're up against.

39:21.104 --> 39:25.438
You need to trust me and take
some advice and get some rest.

39:28.270 --> 39:29.671
How's work?

39:33.771 --> 39:36.438
Starting to get somewhere
with a case.

39:37.504 --> 39:39.038
Feels good.

39:40.537 --> 39:43.072
When I'm there, time just...

39:45.438 --> 39:48.137
doesn't stop for a second.

39:48.139 --> 39:51.504
And then I come here
and see her like this and...

39:57.203 --> 39:58.572
She'll get through this.

40:00.303 --> 40:01.438
I know she will.

40:02.604 --> 40:05.039
I really hope she does.

40:38.671 --> 40:40.669
[Dale] So I just write it down.

40:40.671 --> 40:44.103
It makes me feel like
I know what to do.

40:44.105 --> 40:46.102
Okay, so I think the key point
to understand here

40:46.104 --> 40:50.436
is that Dale controls his
impulses by observing routines.

40:50.438 --> 40:53.201
And these routines
offer him comfort

40:53.203 --> 40:57.072
and a chance to notice if
things are beginning to slip.

40:57.737 --> 40:59.668
So would you say that you notice

40:59.670 --> 41:02.569
when your state of mind
begins to change?

41:02.571 --> 41:05.535
[Dale] It just happens.
There's no warning.

41:05.537 --> 41:08.668
One minute, everything's
all right and the next...

41:08.670 --> 41:11.535
And it's worse in the evenings.

41:11.537 --> 41:14.403
Yes, that's sundowning.

41:14.405 --> 41:17.569
It's actually the time of day
when sufferers of Alzheimer's

41:17.571 --> 41:20.636
and dementia feel most confused,

41:20.638 --> 41:22.703
because of course
as the sun dims,

41:22.705 --> 41:24.703
so too can consciousness.

41:24.705 --> 41:26.469
It's actually
an evolutionary trait

41:26.471 --> 41:28.402
that we're all inherited.

41:28.404 --> 41:33.169
But for dementia patients,
it is acutely heightened.

41:33.171 --> 41:35.603
Okay, and on that note,
we are out of time, I'm afraid,

41:35.605 --> 41:37.268
so we will call it a day.

41:37.270 --> 41:39.668
But I'll look forward
to seeing you all next week.

41:39.670 --> 41:41.137
Thank you, doctor.

41:45.171 --> 41:46.735
Detective.

41:46.737 --> 41:49.236
Would you like
to come to my office?

41:49.238 --> 41:50.605
Sure.

41:52.438 --> 41:56.169
So, detective,
what can I help you with?

41:56.171 --> 41:59.635
Mike Evans.
He's usually in your group.

41:59.637 --> 42:02.502
Not today.
He is a regular though.

42:02.504 --> 42:05.038
Does he open up to you
like the others?

42:06.337 --> 42:07.669
I can't really go into detail

42:07.671 --> 42:10.336
about what a patient
says in my sessions.

42:10.338 --> 42:13.802
That's private and confidential,
you should know that.

42:13.804 --> 42:18.435
Aren't there exceptions
if other lives are in danger?

42:18.437 --> 42:20.469
To an extent, yes.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.006
But can you confirm that?

42:24.304 --> 42:27.039
No. No, not yet.

42:28.670 --> 42:33.435
Look, I understand
your pain towards Mike

42:33.437 --> 42:36.703
and I really want to help but I
honestly don't know where he is.

42:36.705 --> 42:38.803
This isn't about my wife.

42:38.805 --> 42:40.739
It's about something else.

42:42.538 --> 42:45.502
Okay, um...

42:45.504 --> 42:49.268
He's not in the most
stable condition, mentally.

42:49.270 --> 42:55.235
He... he rarely talks
in sessions, let alone opens up.

42:55.237 --> 42:58.169
He sometimes storms out
halfway through a session

42:58.171 --> 43:00.703
and the only real
conversations I've had with him

43:00.705 --> 43:03.135
are about his daughter.

43:03.137 --> 43:05.571
Does he speak to
anyone in the group?

43:06.570 --> 43:08.739
Only Mr. Jacobs.

43:10.304 --> 43:12.236
Dale.

43:12.238 --> 43:13.603
Yes.

43:13.605 --> 43:15.202
You know him?

43:15.204 --> 43:17.672
Yeah, I know the family.

43:19.170 --> 43:22.703
Look, I know Mike's not
the most popular person in town,

43:22.705 --> 43:25.435
but he has actually really
helped Mr. Jacobs

43:25.437 --> 43:27.169
control some of his outbursts.

43:27.171 --> 43:30.468
The two just seem to relate
about Mike's daughter,

43:30.470 --> 43:32.169
Dale's granddaughter.

43:32.171 --> 43:34.803
Oh, and they recently went
on a fishing trip together,

43:34.805 --> 43:36.203
I believe.

43:36.205 --> 43:40.402
Evans attended counseling but no sign
or contact since his last visit.

43:40.404 --> 43:41.702
I think I know
who can find him though.

43:41.704 --> 43:44.302
- Who?
- Dale Jacobs.

43:44.304 --> 43:46.135
I looked through
all the records.

43:46.137 --> 43:48.235
There was a break in at the
hospital about nine months back.

43:48.237 --> 43:51.268
Needles, morphine,
fentanyl, oxycodone,

43:51.270 --> 43:52.702
midazolam and insulin.

43:52.704 --> 43:54.703
All on the list
of missing items.

43:54.705 --> 43:57.269
Guess who was brought in for it?

43:57.271 --> 43:58.335
Mike Evans.

43:58.337 --> 43:59.669
I signed it off.

43:59.671 --> 44:02.335
If you find him, bring him in.

44:02.337 --> 44:03.971
But don't do anything stupid.

44:10.405 --> 44:12.169
Has to be him, but why?

44:12.171 --> 44:14.502
What satisfaction can
he be getting out of it?

44:14.504 --> 44:19.635
I looked into it. Starts off with
drowsiness, then you fall asleep,

44:19.637 --> 44:20.770
except you never wake up.

44:20.772 --> 44:23.571
Yeah,
there's worse ways to go.

44:27.571 --> 44:29.335
Does he think he's helping them?

44:29.337 --> 44:34.301
[scoffs] No, that can't be
his motive for these killings.

44:34.303 --> 44:37.568
Let's check if all the victims
are on the transplant list.

44:37.570 --> 44:40.802
Maybe Holly was ahead of them and
Mike's killing them off to speed it up.

44:40.804 --> 44:43.471
I checked already.
None were.

44:46.037 --> 44:47.435
There's something
missing here.

44:47.437 --> 44:49.668
- I need to talk to Dale.
- Want me with you?

44:49.670 --> 44:52.604
On my own.
It's less stress for him.

45:10.171 --> 45:11.402
Hey.

45:11.404 --> 45:12.803
Hey, how are you?

45:12.805 --> 45:14.301
All right, yeah.

45:14.303 --> 45:15.669
Dale and Kim?

45:15.671 --> 45:18.101
Kim's at her father's.

45:18.103 --> 45:20.036
Grandpa's all right.

45:20.038 --> 45:24.035
He's been much more
in control since, you know.

45:24.037 --> 45:25.036
Yeah.

45:25.038 --> 45:26.336
How are you?

45:26.338 --> 45:28.035
Is there any progress?

45:28.037 --> 45:29.268
Still the same.

45:29.270 --> 45:32.171
The doctors are doing
everything they can but...

45:35.704 --> 45:39.336
Actually came to talk to Dale,
about his therapy sessions.

45:39.338 --> 45:42.369
- Is he about?
- Yeah, he's at the back, painting.

45:42.371 --> 45:44.472
[gunshot]

45:50.303 --> 45:52.171
[screams]

46:32.772 --> 46:34.801
[Sara's voice echoing]
<i>Hey.</i>

46:34.803 --> 46:38.635
<i>Hey, when are you coming home?</i>

46:38.637 --> 46:42.169
<i>I knew you'd still be here.</i>

46:42.171 --> 46:46.502
<i>You said you'd be back
nearly an hour ago.</i>

46:46.504 --> 46:48.439
<i>Isn't that awful?</i>

46:50.303 --> 46:53.204
[voice echoing indistinct]

46:55.037 --> 46:57.169
<i>Hey, when are you coming home?</i>

46:57.171 --> 47:00.738
<i>Said you'd be back
nearly an hour ago.</i>

47:06.405 --> 47:09.104
<i>Ryan, it's our anniversary.</i>

47:25.538 --> 47:29.171
[beeping]

47:31.570 --> 47:34.503
Let me go.

47:34.505 --> 47:36.639
[gasps]

47:47.605 --> 47:51.037
[sirens wailing]

48:06.571 --> 48:10.036
- How is he?
- Could be a crack to the bone.

48:10.038 --> 48:13.472
He'll have a hell of a bruise
but hopefully nothing severe.

48:17.704 --> 48:20.072
Hey. How you doing?

48:21.170 --> 48:23.971
I found this
a couple of days back.

48:25.703 --> 48:30.038
I didn't think much
of it but now...

48:33.671 --> 48:36.238
We had our problems, but...

48:43.271 --> 48:44.439
Hey.

48:48.803 --> 48:50.237
Ryan?

48:51.405 --> 48:53.471
Promise you'll catch
whoever did this.

48:54.637 --> 48:57.205
I will. I promise.

49:38.338 --> 49:39.469
Cheers.

49:39.471 --> 49:41.168
Next time call for backup

49:41.170 --> 49:43.504
before running into the woods
after an armed killer.

49:50.070 --> 49:51.571
How's Amanda?

49:53.538 --> 49:56.539
Coping. Nothing we can do.

50:00.071 --> 50:01.369
Ballistics?

50:01.371 --> 50:02.972
No results.

50:05.238 --> 50:06.604
You see anything?

50:07.636 --> 50:09.169
Happened so fast.

50:09.171 --> 50:10.604
Just came out of nowhere.

50:12.037 --> 50:14.104
You proved a murderer exists.

50:16.204 --> 50:18.104
Yeah, he knew the area well.

50:19.204 --> 50:20.668
And smart.

50:20.670 --> 50:23.535
Forensics have searched
the woods, found nothing.

50:23.537 --> 50:25.705
We started work
on locals with guns.

50:28.271 --> 50:30.205
It's flagged Mike Evans.

50:31.704 --> 50:34.638
He's had a gun license
since Summer '96.

50:36.504 --> 50:39.036
Let's bring him in.
That's enough.

50:39.038 --> 50:41.035
We're watching his house
and his work.

50:41.037 --> 50:43.567
We have blanket surveillance
on his phones.

50:43.569 --> 50:45.504
We'll wait for him to show up.

50:47.370 --> 50:48.604
Ryan.

50:50.338 --> 50:52.171
I know you want it to be him.

50:53.437 --> 50:55.704
He should have
killed me in the woods.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.135
Shit.

51:06.137 --> 51:08.235
Let's go.

51:08.237 --> 51:10.436
[car door opens, shuts]

51:10.438 --> 51:13.168
Can we get a comment on the
recent shootings, detective?

51:13.170 --> 51:16.403
No comment, boys. I'll answer all your
questions tonight at the conference, OK?

51:16.405 --> 51:18.169
Are there rumors
of a killer on the loose?

51:18.171 --> 51:20.136
- Can you confirm or deny this?
- No comment. Get rid of him.

51:20.138 --> 51:22.235
All right, lads,
that's it, go on...

51:22.237 --> 51:24.535
- Sir, do you not think the public deserve to know...
- Off you go!

51:24.537 --> 51:26.038
Thank you!

51:32.037 --> 51:34.501
[beeping]

51:34.503 --> 51:37.101
Ryan, she's got worse.

51:37.103 --> 51:38.537
I tried calling.

51:39.504 --> 51:42.438
She's developed an infection
in her blood.

51:44.203 --> 51:46.768
Doing everything we can.

51:46.770 --> 51:50.438
She's stable for now,
but it's not looking good.

51:52.503 --> 51:54.435
When's the specialist come in?

51:54.437 --> 51:56.301
Tomorrow.

51:56.303 --> 51:57.634
What do you mean, tomorrow?

51:57.636 --> 51:59.537
I want him here now!

52:01.338 --> 52:05.402
Look, Ryan, this place is
full of people in need of help.

52:05.404 --> 52:09.501
I've witnessed it all. Ninety-year-olds
surviving a dozen heart attacks,

52:09.503 --> 52:11.568
people beating cancer,

52:11.570 --> 52:14.201
people waking from
comas after years.

52:14.203 --> 52:15.436
So there is hope?

52:15.438 --> 52:17.302
I'm not saying there isn't.

52:17.304 --> 52:21.169
I'm just saying you need to be
prepared for the worst.

52:21.171 --> 52:24.571
Because those people are
as rare as lottery winners.

52:27.704 --> 52:30.035
Sorry, I have to go home.

52:30.037 --> 52:33.438
It's been a long day, and back
first thing in the morning.

52:44.736 --> 52:46.534
[man]
<i>We have a sighting of Evans.</i>

52:46.536 --> 52:47.734
<i>A neighbor called it in,</i>

52:47.736 --> 52:49.972
<i>Coldwater Lane,
ten minutes ago.</i>

52:51.703 --> 52:53.738
He's armed, remember?

Shit.

55:02.469 --> 55:05.101
[dialing]
[phone ringing]

55:05.103 --> 55:07.368
I need an ambulance
on Stanton Street, quick.

55:07.370 --> 55:08.604
I'm OK.

55:09.703 --> 55:11.470
Just get after him.

55:12.503 --> 55:14.104
Fuck.

55:25.569 --> 55:28.171
[rustling]

55:36.038 --> 55:37.570
[grunting]

55:39.203 --> 55:41.537
[grunting]

55:45.770 --> 55:47.504
Okay, OK.

55:50.436 --> 55:52.971
I know you hate me
for what I did.

55:53.636 --> 55:55.670
Can't change that.

55:56.604 --> 55:58.534
You got any sense of mercy,

55:58.536 --> 56:00.705
you'll help me
save my little girl.

56:03.303 --> 56:05.137
I wake up...

56:07.137 --> 56:09.037
I wake up every day...

56:11.670 --> 56:14.502
thinking about what I did.

56:14.504 --> 56:16.504
How I hurt you.

56:17.470 --> 56:20.205
Pleading that you wake up.

56:22.302 --> 56:24.402
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56:24.404 --> 56:28.069
- It's a little late for sorry.
- No. No, no, no, it's not.

56:28.071 --> 56:30.005
See, I hate myself.

56:31.469 --> 56:33.570
But I love my little girl.

56:35.469 --> 56:38.437
I know this is gonna be
the last time...

56:40.302 --> 56:44.004
I know it's gonna be the last
time I ever see her again.

56:46.403 --> 56:47.538
But you...

56:49.369 --> 56:52.172
you can help her
have a life to live.

56:54.669 --> 56:56.734
Answer me one thing.

56:56.736 --> 56:59.570
Why didn't you
kill me at Dale's?

57:02.237 --> 57:04.204
I didn't kill anyone.

57:06.269 --> 57:09.102
[groaning]

57:09.104 --> 57:11.471
No, no, no,
what have you done?

57:13.170 --> 57:15.637
What have you done,
why did you do that?

57:17.771 --> 57:19.038
Answer me!

57:23.169 --> 57:26.104
I'm sorry about your wife.

57:29.070 --> 57:32.036
No, no, stay with me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

57:32.038 --> 57:33.038
Stay...

Hello?

[beeping]

01:00:33.669 --> 01:00:36.070
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:41.570
We had to move her over to life
support or she would have...

01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:53.171
Is there anything
that can be done?

01:00:56.369 --> 01:01:00.537
At the moment... no.

01:01:06.469 --> 01:01:09.704
[crying]

01:02:28.436 --> 01:02:31.604
[panting]

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:46.567
Shouldn't you be resting?

01:02:46.569 --> 01:02:49.170
I was, but I'm bored already.

01:02:50.403 --> 01:02:52.401
So, Holly Evans
made it through then?

01:02:52.403 --> 01:02:53.601
Yeah.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.401
Surgeon said she'll make
a full recovery.

01:02:56.403 --> 01:02:58.037
That's great.

01:03:00.803 --> 01:03:02.467
I don't think Evans did it.

01:03:02.469 --> 01:03:05.035
What? Why?

01:03:05.037 --> 01:03:08.168
Before he died, he told me
he didn't kill anyone.

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.668
Why would he lie with
the last breath he had in him?

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:13.101
This is Mike Evans
we're talking about.

01:03:13.103 --> 01:03:15.268
I thought you would have
been more relieved.

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:19.101
Yeah, I know. But after seeing the
sacrifice he did for his daughter,

01:03:19.103 --> 01:03:22.067
that's not the personality
of a cold-blooded killer.

01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:26.501
What else we got?
What about Dr. Hill?

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.235
Already cleared.

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:30.568
She was running one of her
therapy sessions at the time.

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:33.300
So this is what
heroes look like.

01:03:33.302 --> 01:03:35.737
Well done, boys,
you made the headlines.

01:03:39.436 --> 01:03:41.570
OK, what's the problem?

01:03:43.771 --> 01:03:45.567
Not convinced.

01:03:45.569 --> 01:03:48.635
- About what?
- The case.

01:03:48.637 --> 01:03:52.167
Everything we needed
was found in Evans's yard.

01:03:52.169 --> 01:03:53.970
It's done.

01:03:56.802 --> 01:03:58.704
[sighs]

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:03.035
Something about
that care home.

01:04:03.037 --> 01:04:04.704
It's all connected somehow.

01:04:05.769 --> 01:04:07.035
How?

01:04:07.037 --> 01:04:11.168
Royce's, Dale, Evans, Dowling.

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:12.738
They were all there.

01:04:14.504 --> 01:04:16.204
That's our link.

01:04:40.437 --> 01:04:42.570
[chattering]

01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:56.567
[Joanne] And how are you
feeling about life now, Ryan?

01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:59.437
- The same.
- [Joanne] How so?

01:05:01.604 --> 01:05:04.671
I'm fine just
to go through each day.

01:05:08.102 --> 01:05:10.503
[Joanne] Is the medication
helping at all?

01:05:14.037 --> 01:05:16.203
Still having
the nightmares but...

01:05:17.236 --> 01:05:19.104
I'm used to 'em now.

01:05:26.436 --> 01:05:28.503
And your wife...

01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:31.503
is she still on life support?

01:05:33.703 --> 01:05:35.137
Yeah.

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:41.733
I keep seeing her
in a crowd of people

01:05:41.735 --> 01:05:44.637
and then she just disappears.

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:49.367
She's...

01:05:49.369 --> 01:05:52.037
She's watching me,
following me everywhere I go.

01:05:53.637 --> 01:05:59.004
I know it's not real,
but I don't want to wake up.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.168
[sighs]

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.636
[Joanne writing]

01:06:18.237 --> 01:06:20.137
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:06:21.802 --> 01:06:24.100
What city?

01:06:24.102 --> 01:06:26.368
Antwerp, Belgium.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:27.700
[phone ringing]

01:06:27.702 --> 01:06:30.170
My grandfather lived there.

01:06:31.137 --> 01:06:34.335
I used to visit
all the time as a kid.

01:06:34.337 --> 01:06:36.103
I'm sorry, would you just...

01:06:37.169 --> 01:06:39.203
Excuse me for a moment.

01:06:41.303 --> 01:06:43.071
Yeah, sure.

01:07:41.802 --> 01:07:43.236
Shit.

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:57.335
[Mike on tape] <i>I understand this is the
only way to save my daughter's life.</i>

01:07:57.337 --> 01:07:59.402
<i>There's no other way.</i>

01:07:59.404 --> 01:08:02.100
<i>That's why I know us both.</i>

01:08:02.102 --> 01:08:03.235
[Jessica] <i>Hello?</i>

01:08:03.237 --> 01:08:04.800
Jessica, listen,
about nine months ago,

01:08:04.802 --> 01:08:06.435
there was a break in
at the hospital, right?

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:07.567
[Jessica] <i>What?</i>

01:08:07.569 --> 01:08:09.567
Needles and a bag
full of drugs.

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:11.701
[Jessica]
<i>Yes, but Mike Evans was...</i>

01:08:11.703 --> 01:08:14.600
Forget Evans. Listen, was there
anything that didn't make sense?

01:08:14.602 --> 01:08:16.234
[Jessica] <i>Ryan, it was
nine months ago.</i>

01:08:16.237 --> 01:08:19.167
Jessica, please,
just try and remember.

01:08:19.169 --> 01:08:21.734
[Jessica] <i>Well, at the time,
I thought it was odd</i>

01:08:21.736 --> 01:08:23.368
<i>that it happened
at the exact moment</i>

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:26.501
- <i>security was swapping shifts.</i>
- Anything else?

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:27.800
[Jessica] <i>It's about
the only time in the day</i>

01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:29.367
<i>that someone could pull it off.</i>

01:08:29.368 --> 01:08:30.700
- <i>Are you OK?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:30.702 --> 01:08:32.167
Look, I'm just gonna get home.

01:08:32.169 --> 01:08:34.438
I'll call you in a bit, OK?
Just...

01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:56.171
[breathing heavily]

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.469
What are you doing, where am I?

01:09:02.568 --> 01:09:04.670
[Joanne]
You'll understand shortly.

01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:09.402
Understand what?
You killed those people.

01:09:09.404 --> 01:09:12.569
I was 21
when I first met Giles.

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.234
I was rushing up
these big stone steps

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:24.368
to get to my class and I had this
ridiculous dress on, so I slipped.

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:28.636
I was falling backwards
and it was Giles that caught me.

01:09:30.102 --> 01:09:31.268
And that was that.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:34.603
I mean, I literally fell
for him right then and there.

01:09:38.569 --> 01:09:41.636
And we had Amy
when we were very young.

01:09:43.303 --> 01:09:47.636
She just made everything
100 times more beautiful.

01:09:54.337 --> 01:09:55.667
And then Giles got sick

01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:58.167
<i>and in those days,</i>

01:09:58.169 --> 01:10:00.466
<i>dementia was much more
difficult to treat</i>

01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:04.569
<i>so his condition
escalated very quickly.</i>

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:08.267
He was always so restless.

01:10:08.269 --> 01:10:11.603
<i>Dementia patients are very hard
to look after when they're young.</i>

01:10:13.037 --> 01:10:15.466
Just about the only time
he was calm

01:10:15.468 --> 01:10:17.300
was when he played with Amy.

01:10:17.302 --> 01:10:21.636
He always knew who she was
but he often...

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:25.300
He often forgot who I was.

01:10:25.302 --> 01:10:27.135
He became so protective of her.

01:10:27.137 --> 01:10:29.701
Sometimes it was almost
as though he thought he needed

01:10:29.703 --> 01:10:34.700
to protect her from me,
like I was some sort of threat.

01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:38.436
Of course, he would often
just wander off on his own.

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:44.467
You know, you of all
people should relate.

01:10:44.469 --> 01:10:45.634
You've lost your wife...

01:10:45.636 --> 01:10:47.703
My wife's not gone!

01:10:50.668 --> 01:10:52.235
What are you doing?

01:10:52.237 --> 01:10:53.503
Where are we?

01:10:54.468 --> 01:10:56.469
What are we doing here?

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:16.034
You've just got no idea
what it's really like

01:11:16.036 --> 01:11:18.037
to see your loved ones
fade away.

01:11:20.036 --> 01:11:23.300
Or in Giles's case,
to see his mind just go

01:11:23.302 --> 01:11:26.236
to the point where they have
no idea who you are anymore.

01:11:27.735 --> 01:11:30.170
And they can cause
harm to themselves.

01:11:31.802 --> 01:11:33.700
And others.

01:11:33.702 --> 01:11:36.569
So I made it my business
to care for those people.

01:11:39.236 --> 01:11:40.533
When Giles was hospitalized,

01:11:40.535 --> 01:11:42.300
I would visit him
as much as I could.

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:43.701
I would take Amy to see him,

01:11:43.703 --> 01:11:46.168
but that was hard on them, too.

01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:50.569
So I'd just sit there
by myself for hours and hours.

01:11:51.803 --> 01:11:54.204
Just like you do with Sara.

01:11:55.202 --> 01:11:57.466
Just waiting for
something to happen.

01:11:57.468 --> 01:12:00.036
You're praying
that she gets better.

01:12:05.269 --> 01:12:09.101
One night when Giles
was home with us,

01:12:09.103 --> 01:12:14.437
he woke up and he took
my baby girl from her cot.

01:12:16.403 --> 01:12:18.200
<i>I was asleep.</i>

01:12:18.202 --> 01:12:22.036
<i>I couldn't watch him all
the time, it was impossible.</i>

01:12:25.368 --> 01:12:27.704
All I ever wanted
was a daughter,

01:12:29.403 --> 01:12:31.767
a best little friend,

01:12:31.769 --> 01:12:34.171
and she was taken away from me.

01:12:38.636 --> 01:12:41.400
So, you see, I'm not a murderer.

01:12:41.402 --> 01:12:43.970
It was an act of mercy.

01:12:44.803 --> 01:12:47.737
My patients were
relieved from their pain.

01:12:49.236 --> 01:12:51.733
That doesn't make it right.

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:54.503
- Who gives you the authority?
- They do.

01:12:55.335 --> 01:12:58.637
- What?
- It is their decision.

01:13:00.235 --> 01:13:02.636
And Evans? What about him?

01:13:04.703 --> 01:13:07.570
Well, that was easy because you
wanted to believe it was him.

01:13:12.436 --> 01:13:13.768
You're sick.

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:16.168
[scoffs]

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:18.036
You think that's...

01:13:21.335 --> 01:13:22.971
At Dale's.

01:13:25.302 --> 01:13:26.436
That couldn't have been you.

01:13:28.702 --> 01:13:32.037
You don't surely think I could
do this by myself, do you?

01:14:01.803 --> 01:14:03.170
Enough.

01:14:10.369 --> 01:14:11.637
Why?

01:14:12.569 --> 01:14:14.236
Listen to me, Ryan.

01:14:15.569 --> 01:14:18.502
Joanne looked after my father
when he was ill.

01:14:20.036 --> 01:14:24.367
We spent three years looking
at him, watching him fade away.

01:14:24.369 --> 01:14:25.666
When my mother was diagnosed,

01:14:25.668 --> 01:14:27.437
I didn't want her to suffer
in the same way.

01:14:29.168 --> 01:14:35.566
Joanne helped her...
just pass peacefully...

01:14:35.568 --> 01:14:37.436
with dignity.

01:14:38.436 --> 01:14:39.500
That's your justification

01:14:39.502 --> 01:14:41.700
for going on a killing spree?

01:14:41.702 --> 01:14:43.701
You think you can just
go round playing God,

01:14:43.703 --> 01:14:45.367
deciding who lives and who dies?

01:14:45.369 --> 01:14:46.701
We didn't decide.

01:14:46.703 --> 01:14:48.800
We gave them an option.

01:14:48.802 --> 01:14:50.667
They made their own choice.

01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:54.570
Ryan, we brought you here
to try and reason with you.

01:14:55.636 --> 01:14:57.166
I thought you would understand

01:14:57.168 --> 01:14:59.036
after everything
that's happened with Sara.

01:15:00.335 --> 01:15:03.566
I mean, what have you gained
from all those months

01:15:03.568 --> 01:15:05.433
just watching her waste away?

01:15:05.435 --> 01:15:07.436
Don't you dare
use Sara as a reason...

01:15:08.236 --> 01:15:10.704
Ryan, she can't be saved.

01:15:12.603 --> 01:15:16.299
We thought of ways to help,
trust me.

01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:18.036
Trust you?

01:15:18.802 --> 01:15:20.437
No.

01:15:22.535 --> 01:15:24.467
You were like family to me!

01:15:24.469 --> 01:15:26.167
You know what, Ryan?

01:15:26.169 --> 01:15:27.768
- [gun cocks]
- None of this really matters

01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:30.034
because I cannot
let you end this.

01:15:30.036 --> 01:15:32.533
We have far bigger
plans than you!

01:15:32.535 --> 01:15:34.170
Joanne, please.

01:15:37.235 --> 01:15:38.569
He's not part of this.

01:15:40.101 --> 01:15:41.502
We need to leave.

01:15:42.568 --> 01:15:45.300
No, he'll come after us.

01:15:45.302 --> 01:15:47.366
You and I both agreed, OK?

01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:50.166
We'd make a fresh start,
just you and me.

01:15:50.168 --> 01:15:52.234
We have to go now.

01:15:52.236 --> 01:15:53.567
No... they will come after us.

01:15:53.569 --> 01:15:56.133
I'm not willing
to take that risk.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:58.233
"Serial Killers
Sentenced to Life,"

01:15:58.235 --> 01:15:59.800
that is what
the headlines will say.

01:15:59.802 --> 01:16:03.434
Joanne, you're not a killer.
Now, give me the gun!

01:16:03.436 --> 01:16:05.801
No.

01:16:05.803 --> 01:16:09.566
- Give me the gun.
- Please, John, don't do this.

01:16:09.568 --> 01:16:10.633
Give me the gun!

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:13.500
[gunshot]
[screams]

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:16.169
[crying]

01:16:17.235 --> 01:16:20.136
No, no!

01:16:33.302 --> 01:16:34.669
It's you!

01:16:35.536 --> 01:16:38.236
You made me do this!

01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:42.567
Joanne, it's over, OK?

01:16:42.569 --> 01:16:45.202
Just put down the gun, please.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:49.801
I can't do this without John.

01:16:49.803 --> 01:16:52.436
- I can't do...
- Joanne, listen to me.

01:16:53.235 --> 01:16:54.400
I can help you.

01:16:54.402 --> 01:16:58.133
Just put the gun down, OK?

01:16:58.135 --> 01:16:59.570
Listen to me.

01:17:02.135 --> 01:17:03.436
Please.

01:17:05.268 --> 01:17:06.768
Joanne...

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:08.704
Joanne, what are you doing?

01:17:11.301 --> 01:17:12.500
Joanne!

01:17:12.502 --> 01:17:14.570
Joanne, listen to me.

01:17:16.435 --> 01:17:19.537
[baby crying]

01:17:25.236 --> 01:17:28.200
Joanne, wait! Joanne!

01:17:28.202 --> 01:17:29.703
Joanne, no, wait!

01:17:30.568 --> 01:17:31.704
Joanne!

01:17:35.503 --> 01:17:37.035
Joanne, no!

01:17:44.436 --> 01:17:46.704
[groans]

01:17:47.702 --> 01:17:51.002
[panting]

01:17:55.502 --> 01:17:58.235
Stay with me.
Look at me.

01:17:59.668 --> 01:18:02.199
[mumbles indistinct]

01:18:02.201 --> 01:18:04.500
Just leave me.

01:18:04.502 --> 01:18:06.300
No, no, no.

01:18:06.302 --> 01:18:08.033
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

01:18:08.035 --> 01:18:09.202
[John] It's OK.

01:18:14.368 --> 01:18:16.070
I'm not scared.

01:18:18.036 --> 01:18:19.036
No.

01:18:20.268 --> 01:18:21.970
Hold on, hold on.

01:18:55.102 --> 01:18:58.103
[beeping]

01:19:55.235 --> 01:19:56.235
[Jessica] Hey.

01:19:58.602 --> 01:20:02.169
If you need anything, I'm here.

01:20:30.436 --> 01:20:33.103
[air pumping]

01:20:47.067 --> 01:20:52.067
