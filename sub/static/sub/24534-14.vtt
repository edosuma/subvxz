WEBVTT

00:26.310 --> 00:30.269
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- Martha.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.444
Just stay with me. Just stay with me.

00:37.530 --> 00:41.614
The blood's comin' out too fast.

00:41.700 --> 00:46.285
Someone will stop. Mmm-hmm.
Someone will help us.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.200
Okay? Okay.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.082
- Martha--
- But you can't go to sleep.

00:52.170 --> 00:55.799
No. You gotta stay with me, okay?

00:55.890 --> 00:57.676
Someone will come, baby.

00:58.430 --> 01:02.423
Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't cry.

01:07.980 --> 01:12.394
Hey! Hey! Help! We need help!

01:24.210 --> 01:28.032
Hey. Hey. We need... Damn it!

01:29.590 --> 01:32.241
Stop. Please!

02:05.540 --> 02:09.533
Well... Oh, please.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.451
My husband...

02:56.800 --> 03:00.759
Someone will help us. Someone will come.

03:07.730 --> 03:11.643
- I won't survive.
- No, no, no. No, no.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.977
No.Shh".

04:02.530 --> 04:07.615
Someone will come.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.541
I don't want to be here,
and I don't know why you didn't take me.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.631
I don't want to be here!
I don't want to be here.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.474
And I don ’t know why you did/7 ’1‘ take me!
’Cause he was so much better.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.768
He was so much better than me.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.101
I don ’1‘ even understand it!

06:02.190 --> 06:04.317
You're a shitty-ass god,
'cause he was a better...

06:04.440 --> 06:05.429
No!

07:20.480 --> 07:24.849
Hey. There something you need?

07:24.940 --> 07:27.181
Some fresh clothes, maybe?

07:27.280 --> 07:30.772
Food? Water?

07:30.860 --> 07:33.488
This is just a few this-and-that
to help people out.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.696
We like to drop 'em about every 10 miles.

07:37.620 --> 07:40.953
- It's "farther".
- What is?

07:41.040 --> 07:45.374
It's "farther". "Further" denotes degree.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.872
"Farther", distance.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.541
I was an English teacher.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.475
Drove everyone up the wall
correcting their grammar.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.972
But words matter.

08:02.060 --> 08:05.689
When we're gone,
they're all we leave behind.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.186
Well, thank you...

08:08.070 --> 08:09.105
- Martha.
- Martha.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.481
Stevie.

08:11.570 --> 08:14.733
Well, you really helped
keep me from looking the fool.

08:16.990 --> 08:20.778
- I what?
- You really helped me there.

08:21.790 --> 08:25.282
I don't.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.166
- Don't what?
- Help.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.046
I don't help.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.757
- You don't help?
- No.

08:38.890 --> 08:41.927
And neither do you.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.577
Why are you doing this?

09:41.700 --> 09:44.828
When you help people,

09:44.910 --> 09:49.586
they never learn to
take care of themselves.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.955
- Who is he?
- Who?

09:52.250 --> 09:57.426
One of your people told me
about the man who started this.

09:57.510 --> 09:59.080
He calls himself "Polar Bear".

09:59.300 --> 10:00.710
I'm not telling you shit!

10:02.930 --> 10:03.965
Maybe not.

10:07.440 --> 10:12.514
But when the time comes,
you'll kill him for me.

10:22.370 --> 10:24.440
That you, Polar Bear?

10:24.540 --> 10:27.828
Do you copy? Over.

10:29.790 --> 10:33.248
Do you copy? Over.

10:33.340 --> 10:36.662
Um, ne/lo?

10:36.760 --> 10:41.709
- Who is this?
- Uh, my name...

10:41.850 --> 10:48.016
I think I hitched a ride accidental/y
/'n the back of a sem/Z

11:51.790 --> 11:53.951
Morgan.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.468
Sarah! Sarah!

12:04.760 --> 12:05.636
It's coming back.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.340
Okay.

12:08.470 --> 12:10.426
- It's jammed!
- Yeah, you think?

12:10.680 --> 12:11.726
Come on, man!

12:13.900 --> 12:14.889
- Okay.
- Come on!

12:14.980 --> 12:16.390
Get off my arm, and get down!

12:19.230 --> 12:21.312
No, down. No, down, down.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.616
Stay down.

12:32.620 --> 12:36.454
- No. No.
- Stay down. Okay?

12:41.210 --> 12:46.045
Are you okay? You okay?

12:46.260 --> 12:49.002
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:49.220 --> 12:50.847
What is she waitin' for?

12:52.520 --> 12:55.762
- Psycho used up all my ammo.
- Yeah.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.477
What the hell is she doing?

12:57.860 --> 12:58.849
You're bleeding.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.066
- Yeah.
- Here. Stay here.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.890
- Keep the pressure on.
- Okay.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.278
- What the hell are you doing?
- He's got this.

13:05.990 --> 13:07.275
Yeah.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.497
We can't stay here.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.161
- I'm gonna help you up, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.912
- Got ya.
- I got it.

13:23.550 --> 13:25.120
Shit in a sandbox.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.715
Get down.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.979
- Okay?
- Yeah.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.140
Al.

13:38.230 --> 13:41.609
- Al!
- Hey. Al! Al, wait!

13:51.280 --> 13:53.362
Hey, hey, hey! Don't do this to them.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.782
I didn't. You did.

13:58.210 --> 14:02.249
You want me to pay for
whatever it is you think I'm doing?

14:03.090 --> 14:05.217
Then make me pay.

14:05.340 --> 14:08.889
You won't end up like them.
You have so much more potential.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.920
You're stuck.

14:14.890 --> 14:18.894
- I was, too.
- I know.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.895
June!

14:33.870 --> 14:36.282
Don't move. Next one lay you down.

14:44.210 --> 14:48.374
- Oh, that's not good.
- Step to, now!

14:49.380 --> 14:51.177
Hug the asphalt!

15:05.480 --> 15:06.526
The boxes.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.450
Oh!

15:22.580 --> 15:23.956
My yeast-cake was in there!

15:27.460 --> 15:30.793
- How many slugs you got?
- Two bird, and one deer.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.580
It's not enough.

15:35.930 --> 15:38.672
Where's the rest of the guns?

15:38.770 --> 15:40.556
They're with your yeast-cake, Jimbo.

15:41.770 --> 15:44.182
They'll finish it.

15:44.650 --> 15:47.471
- That's what they do.
- I said, "don't move!"

15:52.240 --> 15:53.946
Wendell!

15:59.580 --> 16:01.366
Make that one bird.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.876
We need to move.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.866
Where are they?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.242
- Alicia?
- Stay in the car, Charlie.

16:47.630 --> 16:49.621
Morgan?

16:53.090 --> 16:54.580
Morgan!

16:59.220 --> 17:00.209
Alicia?

17:03.940 --> 17:06.898
That woman on the walkie?

17:09.940 --> 17:12.067
Why would she do this?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.826
Alicia?

17:39.800 --> 17:42.553
- They could still be out there.
- They could be anywhere.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.629
That doesn't mean...

17:49.360 --> 17:53.603
They could be any direction.
I'm picking East.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.210
Shit in a sandbox.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.488
And it's just gonna keep building.

18:42.450 --> 18:45.783
You're doin' great.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.799
Shit.

18:53.880 --> 18:58.089
- My ears still ring.
- You probably have a ruptured eardrum.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.876
At least you're mobile.

18:59.970 --> 19:04.213
- You directing that at me, Jimbo?
- No.

19:05.350 --> 19:09.138
Out of all of us, how are you the only one
without a scratch on you?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.931
- Because I'm good.
- Yeah. At ducking.

19:12.690 --> 19:13.725
At living.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.182
- How we looking?
- Picking up bogies every minute.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.351
"Bogies"? Were you military?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.270
- Marines.
- Until?

19:22.370 --> 19:25.237
I didn't exactly fulfil my service
with the United States government.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.117
We can't keep moving like this.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.454
We got to find a place where I can take a
look at everyone before things get worse.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.668
- We can't slow down.
- Maybe we can.

19:36.590 --> 19:38.797
Good eye, Mo-Mo.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.962
We get there. Then what? Wait 'em out?

19:45.810 --> 19:48.973
We need to keep moving away
from the things that want to eat us.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.058
You think you'd get up ahead of 'em,
but you won't.

19:57.610 --> 20:00.693
You know what? I'll take my chances.

20:02.110 --> 20:04.158
Hey, asshole.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.860
You wouldn't even be here

20:05.950 --> 20:08.783
if Mo-Mo hadn't saved your ass
from those meat-munchers.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.788
- You owe the man.
- For what?

20:12.870 --> 20:17.045
We all got shot at
because he brought us back here.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.667
Because he wouldn't listen
to what that wacko said.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.797
She wants him, not us.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.717
If he wants to go, he should go.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.631
Yes.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.898
- You okay?
- Yeah. We gotta move.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.767
Gotta move. Come on.

20:40.070 --> 20:41.947
You really think it's gonna be safe there?

20:42.030 --> 20:45.193
I do.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.248
You coming?

21:35.040 --> 21:39.625
Sarah and Wendell are stitched up.
Ringing in AI's ear is gone.

21:39.710 --> 21:42.838
Luciana's got a mild concussion.

21:42.920 --> 21:47.539
Jim's... Well, he's Jim.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.598
Let me take a look.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.263
We're not gonna be able to stay
in this place for long.

21:59.770 --> 22:02.819
We got medical supplies.
A chance to catch our breath.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.276
We'll move on if we have to.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.247
This was the right call.

22:46.150 --> 22:49.404
- Our lucky day.
- I wouldn't use them.

22:49.490 --> 22:52.732
- That woman might be listening.
- Hmm. Let her hear.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.229
If she's still alive and wants a piece,

22:54.330 --> 22:57.288
I'm sure my brother'd be more than happy
to light her up like a pinball machine.

22:57.370 --> 22:59.668
Nah. I already clipped her pretty good.

22:59.750 --> 23:03.789
Wouldn't feel right
kicking her when she's down.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.335
She shot you.

23:08.420 --> 23:11.833
- Yeah, but I get where she's coming from.
- Seriously?

23:11.930 --> 23:14.501
Shit happens
when you try to help people, man.

23:19.810 --> 23:21.186
That how you got in that chair?

23:22.610 --> 23:24.601
You always ask this many questions?

23:24.690 --> 23:26.646
What happened?

23:27.530 --> 23:28.849
I was 10.

23:28.950 --> 23:32.158
This kid kicked a ball in the street,
and he ran after it.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.573
He didn't see the car that was coming.
I did.

23:35.660 --> 23:40.154
I pushed him out of the way. He got up.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.865
I didn't.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.546
And that's what changed you.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.337
Made you not want to help people?

23:54.010 --> 23:58.174
Hell no.
It made me want to help people even more.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.886
I just thought
I'd have to work harder for things.

24:01.850 --> 24:03.147
What things?

24:05.360 --> 24:10.525
After this, I thought
helping people was my new path.

24:11.740 --> 24:14.652
After I graduated, I rolled my ass down

24:14.740 --> 24:16.901
to that registration office
for the Marines.

24:17.450 --> 24:20.283
Proudest day of my life.

24:20.370 --> 24:23.282
Until that recruiting ofﬁcer
laughed my ass out of that office.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.082
Wouldn't even file my application.

24:30.130 --> 24:32.371
Bad shit happens
when you try to help people.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.836
Now, you're gettin' it.

24:36.260 --> 24:39.093
Now, you gettin' it.

24:51.070 --> 24:53.061
- I didn't see any other cars.
- We'll find one.

24:53.150 --> 24:56.563
- We'll get what we need.
- Maybe we should turn back.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.287
We got to keep moving. Come on.

25:16.840 --> 25:21.925
Nothing. Come on.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.932
- Alicia.
- Yeah?

25:27.440 --> 25:32.776
How would they have gotten this far?
With what happened to them?

25:34.570 --> 25:39.940
We're not looking for Morgan,
or the others.

25:40.030 --> 25:43.864
- Where are we going?
- Galveston.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.032
What? Why?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.917
It's where the beach is.

25:52.670 --> 25:57.835
We only have right now, and who knows
how long we'll have that?

25:57.930 --> 26:01.218
You've never been to the beach.
I'm gonna take you to the beach.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.301
That's one thing I know I can do.

26:22.490 --> 26:26.324
There you are.

26:30.170 --> 26:36.040
You got me out
of some real shit situations,

26:36.130 --> 26:38.712
when you didn't have to.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.008
Still not sure what the hell
I did to make you want to.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.967
Figure I must have charmed you somehow,

26:45.060 --> 26:47.802
or maybe you're just looking forward
to some of my brew.

26:53.400 --> 26:58.736
I was never great at this,
so, I'm just gonna say it.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.448
Earlier, when I said
all this was your fault--

27:06.450 --> 27:08.862
It's not gonna hold.

27:09.370 --> 27:10.359
Go.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.495
Go!

27:42.320 --> 27:44.276
We need to get out of here.

27:44.370 --> 27:45.689
- The ambulance bay.
- Okay.

27:45.790 --> 27:46.984
We just came from there.

27:47.080 --> 27:50.538
- We're not getting out that way.
- Oh!

27:50.620 --> 27:51.951
You said we'd be safe!

27:52.830 --> 27:55.458
That this was the right choice!
That you knew!

27:55.540 --> 27:57.588
Gonna have to ask you
to shut your damn flaphole.

27:57.670 --> 28:00.833
No. No. This guy got us into this.

28:01.090 --> 28:04.298
He had the answer. Had it for all of us.

28:04.470 --> 28:05.880
Well, what now, shot caller?

28:05.970 --> 28:10.009
Because we are all in with you
and you need to get us out of this!

28:17.230 --> 28:22.065
Up. We go up.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.366
Gotta keep going.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.418
- Let's get a move on.
- How many floors are we talking here?

28:35.750 --> 28:39.413
- Wendell, you gotta lay off my beer, man.
- You think this is fun for me?

28:48.890 --> 28:51.131
Higher!

28:51.430 --> 28:54.149
Come on, now.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.997
In here.

29:41.400 --> 29:46.940
What, now?

29:47.030 --> 29:51.569
We need to make sure
all the other stairwells are secure.

29:57.460 --> 30:00.623
Marines. You didn't scrub out?

30:00.710 --> 30:04.373
-Iqmt
-VVhy?

30:04.470 --> 30:07.678
I didn't agree with their code of conduct.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.547
'Cause they rejected Wendell?

30:10.640 --> 30:15.418
Like I said,
didn't agree with their code of conduct.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.890
We can't use the east stairs.

30:26.990 --> 30:31.575
They were dumping the dead in there,
until whoever was left ended up dead, too.

30:31.660 --> 30:36.780
Couldn't even get to the west stairs.
Roof caved in.

30:36.870 --> 30:39.031
Morgan, the barricade.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.410
It's not gonna hold.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.127
Morgan?

30:45.920 --> 30:46.796
Morgan!

30:49.340 --> 30:51.137
Answer the phone already.

30:52.890 --> 30:55.176
The roof.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.420
We 7/ find a way down.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.130
I thought you said the stairs
were a no-go.

30:59.230 --> 31:02.472
I'm not talking about the stairs.
We'll take the elevators.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.397
Wait. Whoa, whoa! Hell no! I can't climb!

31:06.490 --> 31:09.448
No. Luciana, we're on the top floor.

31:09.530 --> 31:12.943
Hospitals put the generators up high
in case of flooding.

31:13.030 --> 31:15.487
- I'm on it.
- No.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.958
You have to make sure everyone
gets to the elevator.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.531
- We got this.
- Let's stir some beef.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.215
We get out of here alive,

31:31.300 --> 31:33.962
can you please just drive us to wherever
the hell in Virginia you're gonna take us?

31:34.050 --> 31:36.348
We will get there soon enough.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.552
Stay there.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.440
Morgan!

31:52.700 --> 31:53.906
Hang on!

32:33.910 --> 32:39.155
- You okay?
- That wasn't so hard.

32:39.240 --> 32:43.279
We found the generators.
- Copy that.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.826
Get it working and meet us
at the elevators, yeah?

32:45.920 --> 32:46.784
Hurry!

32:47.380 --> 32:49.621
We can't hold much longer!

32:54.470 --> 32:56.381
We both go in, we might not
get back out in time.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.050
- Your point?
- Go!

32:58.140 --> 32:59.801
- Be with your brother.
- Al!

32:59.930 --> 33:01.841
There will come a time_
you won't get to be WIth him.

33:01.930 --> 33:03.431
That's not now.

33:05.270 --> 33:07.556
Trust me, it's harder than you think.

33:07.770 --> 33:08.816
Go.

33:08.900 --> 33:09.810
_ A|--
- Go!

33:27.040 --> 33:28.621
We gotta go!

33:31.300 --> 33:33.757
We're on the move! Now!

33:44.520 --> 33:46.431
Al, how we looking?

33:46.520 --> 33:49.011
Stand by.
You should be up and running soon.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.509
We're about to have company.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.311
They're not gonna make it
before the dead arrive.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.061
I'm here. AI's gone solo.

33:55.150 --> 33:57.778
Al, what's going on?
What is Sarah talking about?

33:57.870 --> 34:00.077
Didn ’t make sense for both of us
to get stuck in this broom Closet.

34:00.370 --> 34:01.940
Come on! Come on!

34:02.040 --> 34:03.655
Why the hell isn't it on yet?

34:04.410 --> 34:06.822
Come on. Tell me how it's lookin'.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.793
- Shit. Get ready.
- Come on.

34:19.390 --> 34:21.255
Come on!

34:24.850 --> 34:26.090
Okay.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.839
- You did it?
- I got it! It's open!

34:28.940 --> 34:29.975
- Go, go!
- I opened it!

34:30.060 --> 34:31.061
Come on! Get in!

34:31.150 --> 34:34.108
_ - Come on!
- Get In! We've gotta go!

34:56.880 --> 34:58.211
Clear.

35:05.350 --> 35:10.799
Al? Al, you copy?

35:12.190 --> 35:14.772
She's smart. Resourceful.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.481
She will find a way up here.

35:26.830 --> 35:28.866
Ah, shit.

35:30.210 --> 35:31.746
Fire escape is out?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.049
I don't think
we'd want to go down there if we could.

35:39.050 --> 35:41.462
Hey, what happened there, Jimbo?

35:41.550 --> 35:43.256
Ah...

35:43.350 --> 35:46.808
Went through a window...
killing one of the dead.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.095
You killed one of them?

35:49.230 --> 35:51.266
Yeah. Why?

35:51.650 --> 35:55.893
I should clean that.
Get any glass out before it gets infected.

36:08.330 --> 36:12.744
- Jim.
- What?

36:12.830 --> 36:16.379
- You...
- What?

36:19.170 --> 36:21.502
You didn't get cut by glass.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.560
Do something.

36:38.570 --> 36:42.529
There's... I'm sorry.

36:42.990 --> 36:48.075
There's nothing I can do.

36:48.410 --> 36:49.900
No.

36:50.830 --> 36:56.587
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I have beer to make.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.047
I have beer to make.

37:20.860 --> 37:24.318
- How long is this gonna take?
- I don't know.

37:24.400 --> 37:28.404
Depends on... Don't know.

38:00.230 --> 38:04.735
He asked for my help.

38:04.820 --> 38:07.311
With the walker. He asked me to save him.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.819
You did. As long as you could.

38:19.080 --> 38:23.505
AI's gonna make it back.

38:23.590 --> 38:25.751
We made it here.

38:49.240 --> 38:54.109
- So, what's next?
- You?

38:58.750 --> 39:02.379
You're asking me?

39:02.460 --> 39:05.088
You got us here.

39:06.720 --> 39:10.429
Oh, that's right. I did.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.091
Can you get us out?

39:16.770 --> 39:19.136
The thing is, I can't.

39:27.900 --> 39:29.902
You will.

39:41.250 --> 39:46.790
A little farther,
and we'll hit this road.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.293
Maybe we'll have better luck
finding a car there.

39:50.380 --> 39:55.135
We're hundreds of miles
from the coast.

40:02.190 --> 40:03.305
Charlie?

40:05.770 --> 40:07.567
We should have kept looking for them.

40:08.650 --> 40:11.778
- Wouldn't make a difference.
- You're wrong.

40:12.070 --> 40:13.401
Okay? We should have helped them.

40:13.490 --> 40:15.731
- They need our help.
- How?

40:15.910 --> 40:19.073
They could be anywhere.
They could be dead.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.323
- We don't know.
- No, we don't. We don't know.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.627
We could find them.
Or we could find them dead.

40:24.710 --> 40:26.496
Or we could die trying to find them.

40:29.130 --> 40:32.964
I'm trying to
take you to Galveston.

40:44.060 --> 40:45.516
I just thought if I could help you,

40:45.610 --> 40:51.276
ifI could get you there,
if I could do that, that would be good.

40:54.160 --> 40:58.028
Like, if I could get you to the beach,
I know that would be good.

41:03.290 --> 41:07.533
I just need something to be good.

41:12.800 --> 41:17.419
Yeah. I do, too.

41:25.310 --> 41:26.607
Do you hear that?

41:34.320 --> 41:37.198
Sounds like water.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.993
I don't understand.
It's not on the map.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.660
It flooded.

41:54.300 --> 41:57.428
Alicia. A beach.

42:13.690 --> 42:16.352
Over here.

42:39.010 --> 42:42.594
Alicia. Look.

42:54.730 --> 42:56.812
Holy shit.
