WEBVTT

00:08.258 --> 00:09.844
<i>Previously on "You Me Her"...</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:12.053
We're together. We're a throuple.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.514
I got a connection at Griffin College,

00:13.597 --> 00:15.265
and they're expanding their psych department.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.559
So I will get you a meeting,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.559
little brother.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.478
Do you even want to be a college professor?

00:19.561 --> 00:21.313
I mean, 'cause I don't want to push you into anything.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.064
Pbht. What's that supposed to mean?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.900
Pbht? I just can't help but feel

00:24.984 --> 00:27.778
a little bit Lori-esque, like maybe we've become uncool.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.071
So, you're saying that we're provincial and we're judgmental

00:30.155 --> 00:31.657
because, what, we're not cool anymore?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.909
No.  N-No.

00:33.993 --> 00:35.452
Oh, okay. Because I was gonna say yes.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.205
The Trakarskys and the Amaris

00:38.288 --> 00:39.999
are scheming against me.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.668
Only this time, they've recruited my own daughter.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.920
And, little missy, you can say bye-bye

00:45.004 --> 00:46.714
to that shiny new 3 Series.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.884
Please tell me that you did not threaten to break the leg

00:49.967 --> 00:52.177
of a Hamilton student? Uhhh...

00:52.260 --> 00:54.095
We're just going to delay the announcement of

00:54.179 --> 00:55.472
your promotion a couple of weeks.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.182
Think they even noticed that we left?

00:57.265 --> 00:59.142
Oh, is this about the thing I said about the bike?

00:59.226 --> 01:01.770
You don't think Emma's bi

01:03.647 --> 01:05.566
Who doesn't love a spirited public cuckolding?

01:05.649 --> 01:08.235
Am I the only one questioning their life choices right now?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.779
-I love you. -I love you more.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.575
♪♪

01:23.417 --> 01:26.879
O-kay. Th-e-ere we go.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.674
♪♪

01:45.146 --> 01:47.566
Morning, hottest senator on the hill.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.402
Wish I'd brushed my teeth.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.531
Does Izzy need to get up?

01:54.615 --> 01:55.908
I'll check when I get in the shower.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.285
Kept dreaming Leatherface

01:55.991 --> 01:58.285
was chasing me.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.793
Kind of feel like I'm walking into a fight.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.629
I overreacted.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.299
I was drunk and well up my own ass.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.642
So, what's with the dazzling

02:18.680 --> 02:21.642
dapper

02:21.725 --> 02:24.394
I'm going to the interview at Griffin.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.938
Yeah?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.774
You're positive I'm not

02:28.857 --> 02:31.026
pushing you into anything you don't want to do?

02:31.110 --> 02:33.236
Do you want coffee?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.363
Just say it, Jack.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.198
It's so much worse when you don't.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.955
Okay. We never actually discussed inviting Izzy

02:43.038 --> 02:44.790
to move in with us. You just did it.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.921
So, I've already pushed you into something you don't want to do?

02:51.005 --> 02:53.090
No. I mean, I don't know.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.302
It's just all happening so fast.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.763
Maybe that's why the kitchen's rotating.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.264
Vodka guzzled by the bottle

03:01.348 --> 03:04.059
might be another contributing factor.

03:04.143 --> 03:07.062
Yeah. I heard that doesn't mix very well with fertility meds.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.939
Probably not.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.030
I should've danced. Okay?

03:16.113 --> 03:18.115
Sorry I was acting like such a dick.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.701
Oh, let's just go back to being dizzy together.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.870
All right

03:22.953 --> 03:27.248
Okay. I will make out with you, but brush your teeth.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.877
Yeah. A lot of last night's still in there.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.129
Ew.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.549
Hey, are you nervous?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.300
For the interview?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.219
No, not really.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.471
Well, stressed?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.306
Would you say you're stressed?

03:44.141 --> 03:45.350
Oh, I get it.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.728
Yeah. Super stressed.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.064
Like, I'm having a full-blown panic attack.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.900
Okay, well, don't go anywhere. I will be right back.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.902
Okay.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.075
It's gonna be much better than me and you in

03:58.780 --> 04:01.075
the shower tonight, buddy.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.035
Stop talking to your dick!

04:03.911 --> 04:05.537
Sorry.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.582
But, seriously, it's gonna be awesome.

04:08.665 --> 04:12.002
Good morning. Hey, were you guys talking across me last night?

04:12.086 --> 04:14.671
Uh, no. Must've been a dream.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.798
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.009
'Cause you guys were talking about me snoring,

04:19.093 --> 04:20.552
and I definitely don't snore.

04:20.635 --> 04:24.014
Well, there you go. Clearly a dream.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.810
I got to go blow Jack.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.353
You have to blow Jack?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.940
Was that part of your marriage vows?

04:33.023 --> 04:35.025
Seriously, though, is this, like, an every morning thing

04:35.109 --> 04:36.484
or just to start the week? Shut up.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.445
Does it go both ways?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.448
Can I get in on this situation?

04:43.867 --> 04:46.327
Do you always brush your teeth first?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.421
Actually, got to go now.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.090
Sorry. Can I get a rain check?

04:58.173 --> 04:59.716
Seriously?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.635
It's the thought that counts, right?

05:01.718 --> 05:04.638
Yeah, well, I bet he disagrees.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.307
Yeah, well, he is a total dick, so...

05:07.390 --> 05:09.059
Bye.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.656
Everything okay?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.783
Yeah.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.411
You know, you brushed the hell out of your teeth and gargled.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.623
It seems a shame to waste all that.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.297
I can get out here.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.466
Sure you can, if you want another month without your car.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.801
You realize you're making me hate you

05:42.884 --> 05:44.385
like everybody else does.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.805
Your problem's in the mirror, kiddo.

05:46.888 --> 05:50.558
I am just a kindly mother giving her daughter a ride...

05:50.642 --> 05:54.562
all the way to the main steps.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.732
That's for Freshmen and Sophomores!

05:57.816 --> 06:00.694
And Juniors who conspire with pervy neighbors

06:00.777 --> 06:02.821
against their own mothers.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.199
What --

06:05.282 --> 06:07.284
What is that about?

06:07.366 --> 06:10.745
Do not imagine killing me in my sleep.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.082
Wore that one out.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.542
Whoa, whoa. Unh-unh. Nope.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.460
Get back in.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.628
That is an order. I'm making a silent vow

06:19.880 --> 06:22.049
to never, ever end up like you.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.675
That's not silent. I can hear you.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.345
Well, oops. Guess the cat's

06:23.758 --> 06:26.345
out of the bag.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.972
I may as well start immediately. Every single choice I make,

06:29.056 --> 06:31.892
I'm gonna ask myself, "WWLD --

06:31.975 --> 06:33.685
What would Lori do?"

06:33.768 --> 06:36.230
And then I'm gonna do the exact opposite.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.606
Look at you, thinking you're getting to me.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.026
Look at me, knowing I am.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.777
You'll always be like me. I'll literally be

06:42.861 --> 06:44.529
your polar opposite.

06:44.612 --> 06:48.033
Two months. No car for two months.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.827
Make it three. I like these chats.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.704
Fun, right

06:57.416 --> 06:59.336
Oh, dear God.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.296
I made that.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.674
♪♪

07:10.222 --> 07:13.350
I am so sorry. I just found out

07:10.222 --> 07:13.350
that I'm --

07:15.185 --> 07:16.603
I'm pinch-hitting.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.646
Oh, this just got weird.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.567
Ruby.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.819
Jack.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.571
What are you doing here?

07:26.654 --> 07:29.449
Well, I, uh -- I just walked out of an office that says

07:29.532 --> 07:31.659
"Professor Shivani" on the door, so...

07:31.743 --> 07:33.620
You work here.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.123
Are you interviewing me?

07:36.206 --> 07:39.084
Head of the department called in sick,

07:39.167 --> 07:41.878
or disinterested, or both.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.965
So, yep, I'm interviewing you.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.761
Ruby Shivani.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.513
Jack Trakarsky.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.564
So, whatever happened to the skinny, Nordic-looking chick

08:01.648 --> 08:05.193
you started dating immediately...after...

08:05.277 --> 08:07.195
After you dumped me?

08:07.279 --> 08:10.698
Yeah.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.533
You ever see her?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.787
Occasionally. Here and there.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.999
Mainly 'cause I married her about a decade ago.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.792
No shit. Not an ounce of shit.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.879
Kids?

08:25.964 --> 08:28.342
That's been a trickier road.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.136
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

08:32.471 --> 08:34.348
What about you? What about that ex-boyfriend

08:34.431 --> 08:36.308
that you got back together with and then told me about

08:36.391 --> 08:39.519
by text message?

08:39.602 --> 08:44.107
That was such a dick move that I have tried so hard to forget.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.819
Um, I married mine, too.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.654
I'm not sensing a happy ending.

08:49.737 --> 08:53.408
I wanted kids. He wasn't ready.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.577
Now he has two with someone else.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.873
Look, I'm not trying to make excuses,

08:59.956 --> 09:02.501
but I could tell that your parents didn't like me.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.545
I always wondered, was it an ethnic thing?

09:05.628 --> 09:08.465
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're so Third World, and my dynastic

09:08.548 --> 09:10.884
fox-hunting family would've never accepted you as anything

09:10.967 --> 09:12.427
but the maid?

09:12.511 --> 09:14.721
You did manage to find a chick whiter than you.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.224
That's fair.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.559
Sometimes our photos look like they came with the frames.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.065
It wasn't an "ethnic thing."

09:25.148 --> 09:29.194
It was a "prissy-self-involved thing," to quote my mother.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.946
Yeah. I-I do that when I'm nervous.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.039
Look... I'm sorry.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.177
Antioxidants, Omega

09:54.261 --> 09:55.887
I have no clue what any of those things are,

09:55.970 --> 09:58.348
yet I'm convinced I can't live without them.

09:58.432 --> 10:03.270
So, as they say, about last night?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.439
Get over it. It wasn't that bad.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.191
It was that bad with a dollop of shit on top.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.152
Not sure what was cringier, you and Izzy publicly vacuuming

10:11.236 --> 10:13.738
each other's mouths or Jack awkwardly watching it.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.241
It's not like he's never seen us kiss before.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.119
Well, the untrained eye might mistake you two for

10:19.202 --> 10:22.747
a couple of full-blooded lesbians, not bisexuals.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.541
Well, when I'm with a girl,

10:24.624 --> 10:26.376
how can anyone make that distinction?

10:26.460 --> 10:29.087
What, should I wear a bisexual I.D. badge?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.508
Are you kidding me?

10:33.592 --> 10:35.343
You're kidding me, right?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
After almost a decade of marriage to the love of my life

10:38.763 --> 10:40.014
and -- and you're wondering --

10:40.098 --> 10:41.558
I'm wondering because Jack's wondering.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.853
We're in love. All three of us.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.855
Why -- Why can't you just -- Who are you pitching

10:47.939 --> 10:49.857
this to, me or you?

10:49.941 --> 10:52.068
Or were you practicing for Jack?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.903
Aren't you the sanctimonious -- Whoa, whoa.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.738
That's an open wound.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.532
Let's just...

10:57.616 --> 10:58.908
stick to your mess for now

10:58.992 --> 11:01.995
and we'll circle back to my Crisis of Cool.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.332
What'd he say?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.667
He and Dave were discussing

11:07.750 --> 11:10.211
how fast you remembered how to ride that bike.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.671
The bike being -- Yeah, no, I get it.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.507
Vagina. The bike's a vagina. Carm, I get it.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.426
It's my job, Em. You know that.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.928
Well, you're fired. Doesn't work that way.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.516
As far as that uncool thing goes,

11:22.599 --> 11:24.058
you know, maybe --

11:24.142 --> 11:26.227
maybe you should start a support group...

11:26.311 --> 11:28.229
with Lori.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.024
I-I'm gonna count to 10,

11:31.107 --> 11:33.610
and then I'm gonna throw this murky shit at your head.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.655
So, if I were you, I would try to achieve maximum distance.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.947
Yeah. You wouldn't.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
One, two, three-four-five --

11:42.869 --> 11:45.664
You're just lucky this grainy-ass piss is so expensive.

11:47.706 --> 11:50.502
Oh, God. That's just fucking awful!

11:50.585 --> 11:52.753
Now, Emma wants to quit her job, too.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.591
So, basically, you two are going white-people crazy

11:56.675 --> 11:58.259
because you can't make babies.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.720
I would love to deny that.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.598
Well, I'm a professional, Jack,

12:03.682 --> 12:05.600
which is how I know you really don't want to be

12:05.684 --> 12:07.644
a college professor.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.896
What do you want to do?

12:11.648 --> 12:13.233
I just want to help as many kids

12:11.648 --> 12:13.233
as possible

12:13.316 --> 12:16.486
get safely and sanely to the other side of 18.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.326
I'm starting to think I want the job I walked away from.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.328
Or some version of that.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.541
Oh, shit. I got a thing.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.376
Um, can I see you again?

12:31.459 --> 12:34.921
Like, just for coffee or something?

12:35.004 --> 12:37.591
Confession?

12:37.674 --> 12:39.551
Okay.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.596
I had created this kind of dark fantasy in my mind

12:42.679 --> 12:44.931
about what it would be like if we ever saw each other again.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.225
How did it measure up?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.809
Is divorced enough for you?

12:48.893 --> 12:51.646
Oh, did I mention, I'm on, like, 11 dating sites?

12:51.730 --> 12:53.940
Hmm. You could've had the common decency to at least be

12:54.023 --> 12:56.693
morbidly obese, or have terrible skin,

12:56.775 --> 12:58.903
or peg leg due to diabetes.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.697
Sorry.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.543
I forgave you a long time ago.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.763
Thanks. Bye.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.401
Professor Shivani?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.069
Yeah.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.195
She's hot.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.364
She is.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.158
You thinking about bringing her in the mix, too?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.245
Andy.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.664
Yep.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.873
Who knows Izzy. Yep.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.544
Just to explain this,

13:56.628 --> 13:59.172
we were friends, like a million years ago.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.382
Really good friends, Ruby and I.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.259
Got it. Yeah?

14:05.219 --> 14:07.681
All right, fine. She was my ex.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.848
Okay. My ex-girlfriend before Emma.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.559
Can we keep this between us?

14:11.643 --> 14:13.436
If you ran into an old flame, I mean,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.313
why do you got to keep that a secret?

14:15.396 --> 14:17.064
And you're right about -- yeah.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.857
Can we also keep that between us,

14:18.941 --> 14:21.695
the fact that I asked you to keep it between us?

14:21.778 --> 14:24.405
Here's my deal, okay?

14:24.489 --> 14:28.368
You buy lunch, one hour of free counseling,

14:28.451 --> 14:32.789
and I never saw you, uh, mooning after your ex.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.999
Fine.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.711
Why does everyone keep blackmailing me these days?

14:37.794 --> 14:39.546
You're going through some very strange shit,

14:39.629 --> 14:41.130
ain't you, Uncle Jack?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.050
I am. Yeah. I am going through some tough stuff. Yeah.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.931
Look, I'm getting this vibe like Nina's...

14:51.015 --> 14:55.395
holding back, playing it cool, you know?

14:55.478 --> 14:59.065
So, scary Nina That's what we're talking about?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.442
Yeah. Scary Nina. Really.

15:01.526 --> 15:05.196
Okay. You're serious about her?

15:05.279 --> 15:06.906
Yeah.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.033
I know it's fast, but it's like I snapped out of this coma

15:09.116 --> 15:11.411
and she was the first face that I saw.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.079
Aww.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.206
Bro. Sorry.

15:15.289 --> 15:18.251
I'm guessing that Nina is scary

15:18.334 --> 15:20.336
because she's scared.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.340
Listen to that man. That is some profound shit.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.175
So, you got to hold her close, man.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.052
Got to hold her real tight, like a...

15:28.135 --> 15:30.179
autism blanket,

15:30.263 --> 15:34.183
until the spasms and the fits subside.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.102
And then we're good? No.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.355
Then she'll have even more fits and more spasms.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.816
That's fuckin' awful.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.777
Mm.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.695
But then, at the end of that, at least she'll finally

15:45.779 --> 15:47.572
believe in you.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.825
Anyway, that's what you're signing up for.

15:50.909 --> 15:54.078
That is so fucking good,

15:54.161 --> 15:55.830
I'm gonna

15:55.914 --> 15:57.957
So, we got autism,

15:58.040 --> 16:02.879
fits, persistence, right? Looks like you got it.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.005
Hello?

16:05.089 --> 16:09.260
Ruby. No. I'm actually just a few blocks away. Why?

16:09.343 --> 16:11.721
Sure. I'll be right there.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.598
I got to run.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.391
You're making this really rough on me, Uncle Jack.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.101
What're you talking about

16:17.184 --> 16:18.352
I'm talking about you.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.730
Professor Shivani. That was serious, right?

16:20.814 --> 16:21.815
No. Yes.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.023
You got it all wrong, man.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.358
The road not taken.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.278
No. There's nothing. It's nothing going on.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.196
You sure? Yes, I'm sure.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.616
Fuckin'-A. I can't just walk and --

16:31.699 --> 16:33.033
Just calm down. Just get accusations

16:33.117 --> 16:34.828
thrown left and right. There's nothing going on.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.871
Fuck!

16:38.456 --> 16:40.708
But, um, I was never here.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.294
This never happened.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.755
Hmm... Right?

16:45.839 --> 16:48.132
Sure. Do I need a receipt or...

16:48.215 --> 16:50.468
We don't do receipts.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.136
Okay, don't leave my tab open.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.266
I left his tab open.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.864
So, how would you feel about helping kids

17:10.947 --> 17:14.158
get to the other side of 21 instead of 18?

17:16.494 --> 17:20.039
Like, counseling for Griffin students?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.542
Like a wellness center.

17:22.625 --> 17:27.087
What an amazing idea. You are so smart, Jack.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.256
All kidding aside,

17:29.340 --> 17:31.133
I really wish women still did that.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.969
Well, we don't, so get over it.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.846
Okay.

17:34.929 --> 17:38.725
This is probably me making this unnecessarily weird,

17:38.808 --> 17:41.143
but, um...

17:41.227 --> 17:44.981
you ever think about me over the last dozen years?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.900
Um... Oh, God. That was so stupid.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.234
I'm sorry. Yeah, no. No.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.777
That -- Rewind. Erase.

17:49.861 --> 17:53.239
Look, I got to go, so, I will call you and --

17:53.322 --> 17:56.784
Your watch is on the other wrist, by the way.

17:56.868 --> 18:00.747
And yes. Yeah, of course I've thought of you.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.007
I'll call you about the wellness center.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.258
Cool. Cool. Yeah.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.343
Okay.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.602
We need you guys to know this was not an easy call for me.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.478
Are you fucking kidding me right now, Andy?

18:24.562 --> 18:27.231
You barely know Uncle Jack.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.401
It's not even really like he was doing anything wrong.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.738
You know, it's not like they were making out or something.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
Okay, if it was all so inconsequential,

18:35.823 --> 18:38.117
why the fuck are you telling us?

Answer the girl.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.415
Okay, um...

18:44.498 --> 18:49.211
Because it -- She didn't seem like an ex.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.714
She seemed like<i> the</i> ex.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.884
The one that got away.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.511
Why else would he tell me not to say anything?

18:57.595 --> 18:59.305
Oh, fuck.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.974
Yeah. It's okay.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.059
Why would he do this?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.936
Because he's insecure about his place

19:05.019 --> 19:08.022
in this wacky new relationship.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.108
Because men?

19:10.190 --> 19:12.860
Oh, nice. What would happen if I said, "because women"

19:12.944 --> 19:14.236
about anything?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.906
Maybe some day, when we're all squared up, okay?

19:18.365 --> 19:22.202
It feels fragile. The three of us.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.663
So shocking. Ow!

Stop. Do not hit me back.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.036
I fucking do, too.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.871
Are you gonna finally be honest and say what you fucking think?

23:33.954 --> 23:35.497
All right. Here it is. Let's hear it.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.333
You guys have been third- wheeling the shit out of me!

23:37.415 --> 23:38.959
Ka-fucking-blam!

23:39.043 --> 23:40.794
Okay. Okay, just let me get this straight.

23:40.878 --> 23:44.506
So, you get to "undercurrent" all over your primary ex

23:44.590 --> 23:49.511
because you've decided that I'm not fluid, I'm a lesbian?

23:49.636 --> 23:51.555
That's right. Jack told the Imaris I might be

23:51.638 --> 23:52.806
full-blown gay.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.308
That's not at all what I said.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.102
So, I guess that means that you've decided for me too?

23:56.185 --> 23:59.188
Are you the official Minister of Sexual Orientation?

23:59.272 --> 24:01.899
Congratulations. You know what? Fuck you, Jack.

24:01.982 --> 24:05.027
Fuck you and your fragile, little male ego.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.112
Really

24:06.195 --> 24:07.363
Yeah. Okay, well, fuck you

24:07.445 --> 24:08.906
for making massive life decisions

24:08.989 --> 24:10.908
completely on your own that affect both of us.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.701
Is that

24:12.785 --> 24:14.661
Um... Are you talking about me?

24:14.745 --> 24:17.748
Well, then, fuck you both

24:17.831 --> 24:21.335
for chasing me down half-cocked, you matching set of dumbshits!

24:21.419 --> 24:23.129
We should've thought it through more. That was --

24:23.212 --> 24:25.047
Yeah. That was on both of us.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.474
This is good, because we're throwing all of our shit

24:36.558 --> 24:39.228
on the table to flop around where we can see it.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.273
But why would shit be flopping around?

24:42.356 --> 24:44.150
Yeah. It probably should've been fish.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.693
The-- Then it's a fish.

24:46.777 --> 24:50.656
The point is, is that we knew this wasn't gonna be easy.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.662
Right.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.291
I'm sorry for making you feel like the odd man out.

25:00.374 --> 25:03.043
Me, too.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.380
And I'm sorry for keeping

25:06.464 --> 25:10.050
the "girl-girl-girl" thing from you.

25:10.134 --> 25:13.012
I know that's a big part of what you're feeling.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.601
Well, I'm sorry if I "subtextually" acted out

25:19.685 --> 25:22.438
instead of just talking to you guys about it.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.359
This is good.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.068
We've done good work here.

25:28.152 --> 25:32.448
And now we're gonna have sex.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.658
Well, that was a sharp turn.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.534
Mm, yep. We're gonna fuck it out.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.787
I think the term is "hug it out," right, Jack?

25:38.871 --> 25:41.957
You guys are more than welcome to keep talking,

25:42.041 --> 25:45.711
but I'm gonna go

25:45.794 --> 25:47.463
back up to the bedroom,

25:47.545 --> 25:49.547
and I'll leave this dress here.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.549
But I can keep the heels on.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.597
So 26.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.476
"Fuck it out." You think that's gonna work?

26:02.769 --> 26:04.271
Okay, so I'm good.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.689
Hmm. Me, too.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.900
Told you.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.735
Mm.

♪♪

26:20.120 --> 26:22.081
So, apparently, "Fuck it out" doesn't actually work

26:22.164 --> 26:24.417
for suburban 30-somethings.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.377
Good thing, because I'd be out of business.
