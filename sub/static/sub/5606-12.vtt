00:01.769 --> 00:03.602
<i> Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:03.604 --> 00:05.070
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:05.072 --> 00:06.638
Aunt Deb?
(chuckles)

00:06.640 --> 00:08.774
DEB:
<i> So, I went to the doctor, and</i>

00:08.776 --> 00:10.542
they ran a whole bunch of tests,

00:10.544 --> 00:11.610
and, um,

00:11.612 --> 00:13.612
I have a tumor in my brain.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.280
STEVE:
<i> Aunt Deb, she's sick.</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:16.615
It's inoperable.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.717
But she's refusing
any other kind of treatment.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.219
I guess that's her choice,
right?

00:20.221 --> 00:22.054
Well, yeah, it's her choice,
but here's the thing:

00:22.056 --> 00:24.456
I mean, it's not just her
who's gonna be affected by this.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.126
<i> Aunt Deb practically raised</i>
<i> my sister Mary.</i>

00:27.128 --> 00:28.127
We're gonna get through this.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.261
(sniffles)

00:29.263 --> 00:32.498
You know that?

00:32.500 --> 00:35.167
Listen, I'm so glad
you decided to fight back, Deb.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.635
DEB: You can thank
Leonard for that.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.736
Leonard popped the question,

00:37.738 --> 00:41.106
and I said yes.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.642
Who here presents
this lovely bride

00:43.644 --> 00:46.345
to be married
to this man?

00:46.347 --> 00:48.147
I do.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.115
You may kiss
the bride.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.618
(applause)

00:52.620 --> 00:56.121
DEB: <i> I remember
everything</i> <i> about that day.</i>

00:56.123 --> 01:00.159
I was wearing
this wedding dress.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.061
The trade winds had settled,

01:02.063 --> 01:05.364
and there wasn't a cloud
in sight.

01:05.366 --> 01:10.102
The ocean was as blue
as the sky.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.571
It was magnificent.

01:13.808 --> 01:17.676
But compared to you...

01:17.678 --> 01:20.546
(sighs) You were standing
there in your tuxedo,

01:20.548 --> 01:24.149
so... so handsome, so dapper.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.454
You called me
your angel.

01:28.456 --> 01:31.223
Your one in
a million.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.726
I had never been so happy.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.728

01:36.730 --> 01:39.765

KONO: Liani's father was back at camp.
He heard

10:03.170 --> 10:04.703
the gunshots,
and he ran into the jungle

10:04.705 --> 10:06.638
and found his son lying here
with two gunshot wounds

10:06.640 --> 10:09.641
to the chest. No sign of a shooter.
All right, well, the kid

10:09.643 --> 10:11.643
is still in surgery.
According to the nurse,

10:11.645 --> 10:14.913
in addition to the injuries
that he got from the bullets,

10:14.915 --> 10:16.381
he also sustained
several fractures

10:16.383 --> 10:18.817
consistent
with a very serious fall.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.320
Hey, that's a koa tree.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.322
It's the wood
that Liani would've needed

10:24.324 --> 10:26.024
to carve his spear. CHIN: Okay.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.193
So he got shot up there,
and either

10:28.195 --> 10:30.395
he fell over the side
or he got thrown off.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.198
Look. Looks like he cut a path
through here on his way up.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.969
GROVER:
Okay. Kono and I

10:37.971 --> 10:39.237
will go up and
take a look.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.705
Okay. We'll go talk
to the other kids,

10:40.707 --> 10:41.873
see if they saw
anything.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.843
Okay.

10:46.713 --> 10:47.412
Hey, you think they're, uh...

10:47.414 --> 10:50.048

10:50.050 --> 10:52.317

11:03.897 --> 11:05.964
Footprints.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.373
I got gravitational blood drops.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.242
This is definitely
our crime scene.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.782
Okay.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.384
I got a second set
of footprints.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.820
Tire tracks.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.003
Kono.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.274
These drag marks are fresh.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.775
This door has been
opened recently.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.059
The hell is this place?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.061
During World War II,
the U.S. military

12:10.063 --> 12:12.163
had munitions bunkers
all over the island.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.232
Yeah?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.301
Well, I don't think
this was one of 'em.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.940
That flag represents
the Empire of Japan.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.809
After Peal Harbor,
some Japanese Americans

12:24.811 --> 12:26.010
sympathetic to the emperor

12:26.012 --> 12:27.779
went underground
to avoid internment.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.781
This could've been
a hiding place.

12:29.783 --> 12:33.184
GROVER:
Okay. I'll buy that.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.186
That still doesn't explain

12:35.188 --> 12:37.355
what our shooter
was doing in here.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.757
Look-- more footprints.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.880
Well, he's not gonna have
any answers for us.

13:07.789 --> 13:09.488
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

13:14.228 --> 13:18.297
Well, judging by the size
and density of the radius,

13:18.299 --> 13:21.901
I'd say these are the remains
of a mature adult male.

13:21.903 --> 13:23.536
Furthermore,
I'd estimate

13:23.538 --> 13:26.205
they're as old
as this rather spacious crypt.

13:26.207 --> 13:28.207
Okay, well,
without the rest of him,

13:28.209 --> 13:31.210
I imagine it's gonna be pretty
tough to determine C.O.D.

13:31.212 --> 13:32.211
Well, perhaps not.

13:32.213 --> 13:34.380
CSU found this

13:34.382 --> 13:35.514
in the soil among the bones.

13:39.921 --> 13:42.254
Oh, a slug.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.256
Hey, what if the person
who shot Liani

13:44.258 --> 13:46.258
was in here covering up
an old murder?

13:46.260 --> 13:49.228
Yeah, but why now,
75 years after the fact?

13:49.230 --> 13:51.163
Hey, guys.

13:51.165 --> 13:52.598
I got something
you need to see.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.051
<i> Based on the width of the axle</i>

13:56.052 --> 13:58.102
and the size of the tires,
I'd say our shooter was driving

13:58.105 --> 14:00.206
some sort of cargo van.
Once I get these impressions

14:00.208 --> 14:02.408
back to the lab, I'll narrow
down a make and model,

14:02.410 --> 14:04.243
no problem. But in the meantime,
check this out.

14:04.245 --> 14:06.912
The approaching
tread impression is shallow,

14:06.914 --> 14:08.731
the departing
is deep.

14:08.732 --> 14:10.549
So the van came up here empty
and left full.

14:10.551 --> 14:12.551
Best guesstimate,
about 2,000 pounds full.

14:12.553 --> 14:14.119
GROVER:
Well, this wasn't about

14:14.121 --> 14:15.221
some old bones, then.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.322
There was something else
in that bunker.

14:23.397 --> 14:27.266
STEVE: Morning's yours, Aunt Deb.
What do you want to do?

14:27.268 --> 14:28.901
What do I want to do?

14:28.903 --> 14:30.436
I want to drive your truck.

14:30.438 --> 14:31.871
What?

14:31.873 --> 14:33.339
Your pickup truck.
I-I want to take

14:33.341 --> 14:35.341
that bad boy for a spin.
Oh, my gosh.

14:35.343 --> 14:37.243
Do you even know
how to drive, Aunt Deb?

14:37.245 --> 14:40.179
Honey, I lived in Los Angeles
my whole life.

14:40.181 --> 14:43.182
I was driving before
you were in camo diapers.

14:43.184 --> 14:44.516
I-I know, but why

14:44.518 --> 14:46.385
the sudden urge
to drive a truck?

14:46.387 --> 14:48.520
Well, you know, actually,
it's for Leonard.

14:48.522 --> 14:51.290
Uh, last year, we got together

14:51.292 --> 14:53.292
and we made up a list of things

14:53.294 --> 14:55.594
that each one of us
wanted to do before we died.

14:55.596 --> 14:57.162
Like a bucket list?
Yeah.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.497
What was on it?

14:58.499 --> 15:00.366
Well, we wanted
to see the pyramids,

15:00.368 --> 15:02.434
we wanted to learn
how to ski, and...

15:02.436 --> 15:04.169
I wanted to get a tattoo.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.471
Oh, don't get
a tattoo.

15:05.473 --> 15:06.906
Trust me, it's not the...

15:06.908 --> 15:09.375
It's too late. (laughs)
Wow.

15:09.377 --> 15:10.542
Look.

15:10.544 --> 15:12.411
Yeah, sorry, kiddos,
but the two of you

15:12.413 --> 15:15.314
are not the only ones
in the family now with ink.

15:15.316 --> 15:18.350
Okay, good. I'm glad you have ink.
(laughs)

15:18.352 --> 15:20.519
So, um, anyway, we never did

15:20.521 --> 15:23.188
get to finish the list,
but one of the items

15:23.190 --> 15:25.057
on Leonard's list was

15:25.059 --> 15:27.960
he wanted to drive a police car.

15:27.962 --> 15:30.062
That's such a boy thing.
So, uh,

15:30.064 --> 15:31.397
how many ponies under that hood?

15:31.399 --> 15:32.998
I'd really... I'd really prefer

15:33.000 --> 15:35.501
you didn't find out.
Steven, I hate to play

15:35.503 --> 15:38.504
this card,
but I just lost my husband,

15:38.506 --> 15:41.240
so you're not really
gonna deny me this, are you?

15:43.177 --> 15:45.611
(siren wailing)

15:45.613 --> 15:47.579
(laughing)

15:48.549 --> 15:50.616
JOAN:
<i> We're flying!</i>

15:53.020 --> 15:55.421
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

15:55.423 --> 15:58.090
You look a little green. No, I'm...
Can you please watch the road?

15:58.092 --> 15:59.458
Please keep your eyes
on the road.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.161
This is torture
for you, isn't it?

16:02.163 --> 16:03.529
Mm-hmm.
(Joan laughs)

16:03.531 --> 16:05.130
Are you gonna puke?

16:05.132 --> 16:06.365
(laughs) Puke, puke!
Uh, no, Jo...

16:06.367 --> 16:08.701
Joanie, don't.
I'm not gonna puke, Joanie.

16:08.703 --> 16:10.369
JOAN:
Puke, puke, puke,

16:10.371 --> 16:11.437
puke, puke...
He's gonna puke.

16:11.439 --> 16:12.972
I'm not gonna puke!
...puke, puke...

16:12.974 --> 16:14.006
Tell her to be quiet.

16:14.008 --> 16:16.008
(tires screech)

16:16.010 --> 16:18.477
(whoops, laughs)

16:27.221 --> 16:28.520
Hey.

16:28.522 --> 16:31.156
Hey. You look like
you just saw a ghost.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.058
Rough commute.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.027
How's your aunt?

16:35.029 --> 16:37.196
She's fine. She's, uh...
she's actually not bad,

16:37.198 --> 16:39.431
everything considered.
Thanks for asking.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.700
Kono filled me in,
but what's the latest?

16:41.702 --> 16:42.885
Well, couple developments.

16:42.886 --> 16:44.069
For starters,
ballistics just came in.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.204
Yeah, the two slugs
pulled out

16:45.206 --> 16:46.538
of the kid and the one
found with the bones

16:46.540 --> 16:48.374
were fired from
the same weapon.

16:48.376 --> 16:50.175
A Japanese Nambu pistol.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.444
Standard issue for the Japanese
military during World War II.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.313
Discontinued,
1945.

16:54.315 --> 16:56.582
Wait a minute, this thing was
in the bunker all these years,

16:56.584 --> 16:58.150
then that kid walks in

16:58.152 --> 17:00.486
and our suspect picks this up
and shoots him with it?

17:00.488 --> 17:03.155
Yep. And now he's fighting
for his life at King's Medical.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.724
Okay. What else we got?

17:05.726 --> 17:07.526
Check this out.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.361
(whoops)

17:09.363 --> 17:11.263
What was inside?

17:11.265 --> 17:12.464
Cyanide.

17:13.434 --> 17:14.466
Cyanide?

17:14.468 --> 17:15.734
I know, crazy, right?

17:15.736 --> 17:17.436
The secret bunker,
the World War II pistol,

17:17.438 --> 17:20.139
the kill pill in the ring
with the hidden compartment?

17:20.141 --> 17:21.440
I mean, this is some real-deal

17:21.442 --> 17:23.509
secret agent stuff.
Take it easy.

17:23.511 --> 17:25.110
Obviously, we think
the remains in the bunker

17:25.112 --> 17:26.478
could've been those
of a Japanese spy.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.247
Yeah, Max managed to scrape
together a DNA sample.

17:28.249 --> 17:29.815
We're hoping Japan
will help us I.D. it.

17:29.817 --> 17:32.051
Yeah, once we figure out who
the rotting corpse belongs to,

17:32.053 --> 17:34.186
it'll help us figure out who was
up there this morning and why.

17:34.188 --> 17:35.654
And what about the rest
of the evidence?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.121
Actually, I was just
getting to that when you

17:37.124 --> 17:39.324
walked in. Now, I can tell
you what all this stuff is,

17:39.326 --> 17:41.693
but I got no idea what any of
this means. This is washi.

17:41.695 --> 17:44.396
A light but durable paper
made from the mulberry bush.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.764
Definitely of Japanese
origin. Over here

17:45.766 --> 17:47.433
we got canvas bags,
some bungee cables.

17:47.435 --> 17:49.701
Now, the only thing I can
tell you about these items is,

17:49.703 --> 17:52.504
like the paper, it's old. Like,
circa 1904s-old. (phone dings)

17:52.506 --> 17:54.840
Also made
in Japan.

17:54.842 --> 17:58.410
CHIN: I just got a "Jerry
Alert." STEVE: Yeah, me too.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.412
Same.  Yeah, hope
you don't mind,

18:00.414 --> 18:01.580
I took some initiative.

18:01.582 --> 18:03.248
Fed your boy Ortega
some of this intel.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.616
Figured it was in
his wheelhouse.

18:12.660 --> 18:15.094
Hey.

18:15.096 --> 18:16.562
Beautiful day,
isn't it?

18:16.564 --> 18:18.764
Uh-huh.
God, I love the ocean.

18:18.766 --> 18:20.466
It just calms me.

18:20.468 --> 18:22.634
Huh. Well, actually,
it's overcast today.

18:22.636 --> 18:23.919
Not in here.
It's always perfect.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.203
All right,
I know it's not real,

18:25.206 --> 18:27.506
but I had to do something.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.807
My mother's basement had more
natural light than this place.

18:29.810 --> 18:31.543
Plants won't even
grow down here.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.178
I was starting to lose it.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.513
Jerry, your text
said it was urgent.

18:34.515 --> 18:36.348
You're not exactly
radiating urgency.

18:36.350 --> 18:39.184
Okay, gather round and prepare
to have your minds blown.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.587
And I'm not just talking
figuratively. Pun intended here.

18:41.589 --> 18:43.622
Okay, Jer.
Right. So...

18:43.624 --> 18:46.391
In 1944, the Japanese military

18:46.393 --> 18:48.494
initiated a program
called Operation Fugo.

18:48.496 --> 18:50.596
They used the winter
trade winds to launch

18:50.598 --> 18:52.564
thousands of balloon bombs
from Japan,

18:52.566 --> 18:54.800
across the Pacific,
timed to detonate

18:54.802 --> 18:56.435
when they reached
the U.S. mainland.

18:56.437 --> 18:59.805
As it happens, these balloons
were made of paper.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.273
Anybody want to guess
which kind?

19:01.275 --> 19:02.674
Uh, washi?

19:02.676 --> 19:05.844
Gold star for you, Inspector.

19:05.846 --> 19:08.747
Canvas bags filled with sand
and bungee cords

19:08.749 --> 19:11.717
were used as part of the ballast
to help control the trajectory.

19:11.719 --> 19:14.720
Each of these balloons
was equipped with an incendiary

19:14.722 --> 19:17.756
explosive device
and a 15-kilogram bomb.

19:17.758 --> 19:20.826
These bombs were designed
to fall on populated areas,

19:20.828 --> 19:22.895
kill civilians
and ignite forest fires.

19:22.897 --> 19:25.697
The concept was genius.

19:25.699 --> 19:27.766
But the operation
was an epic fail.

19:27.768 --> 19:29.434
Well, maybe 'cause it
sounds like a plan

19:29.436 --> 19:31.920
concocted by
Wile E. Coyote.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.405
Look, if this Fugo operation
was launched in Japan,

19:34.408 --> 19:37.643
why did we find all the materials in
a bunker on Oahu? JERRY: Here's why:

19:37.645 --> 19:39.711
My Far East sources-- the same
ones that helped us with

19:39.713 --> 19:41.580
the Chinese satellite situation
a couple years back--

19:41.582 --> 19:45.651
tell me that there's classified
intel that in the summer of 1940

19:45.653 --> 19:46.885
the Japanese government

19:46.887 --> 19:49.254
was secretly
developing Fugo here on Oahu,

19:49.256 --> 19:50.589
with a planned launch

19:50.591 --> 19:52.591
coinciding with the bombing
of Pearl Harbor.

19:52.593 --> 19:55.627
All the necessary supplies
were smuggled in,

19:55.629 --> 19:58.730
but something happened
and it never became operational.

19:58.732 --> 20:00.432
So what you're saying
is you think

20:00.434 --> 20:03.335
that bunker may have
been full of bombs. Yeah.

20:03.337 --> 20:04.770
That sounds like something
someone might shoot a kid over.

20:04.772 --> 20:06.405
ABBY:
According to Eric,

20:06.407 --> 20:07.673
that van weighed almost a ton

20:07.675 --> 20:09.241
when it left the area.

20:09.243 --> 20:10.776
That's a lot of explosives.

20:10.778 --> 20:12.444
Yeah, it is.
And after all this time,

20:12.446 --> 20:14.129
they're gonna
be highly unstable.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.813
Which means that detonation--
whether intentional

20:15.816 --> 20:18.784
or otherwise--
in a populated area...

20:18.786 --> 20:20.786
We're gonna be looking
at a mass body count.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.829
NICKY: Is there anything in
this place that is not fried?

20:31.831 --> 20:34.799
The napkins.
(laughs)

20:34.801 --> 20:37.768
So... tell me, Nicky,
how's the singing racket?

20:37.770 --> 20:41.872
Not bad, but it would be
a lot better if I had a partner.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.908
My nephew warned
me about this.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.376
Don't think about it.
Just say yes.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.844
No, I'm afraid not, Nicky.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.646
That ship has sailed.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.515
Oh, the hell it has.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.383
Do you remember Thanksgiving
a couple years ago,

20:52.385 --> 20:54.785
you got up on stage,
you belted out

20:54.787 --> 20:56.954
an Irving Berlin number?

20:56.956 --> 20:59.523
You were dynamite.
The club loved you.

20:59.525 --> 21:00.992
That was a nice
night, wasn't it?

21:00.994 --> 21:03.728
And there'll be
many other nights just like it.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.329
No, I don't think so.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.497
Listen to me,
I get your apprehension,

21:06.499 --> 21:08.466
but just hear me out.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.767
Nicky.
Renovations on the club,

21:09.769 --> 21:11.335
they'll be done
in a couple of months.

21:11.337 --> 21:12.803
Look, honey...
The next time you come out...

21:12.805 --> 21:15.373
Honey... ...we'll bang
out a couple of duets...

21:15.375 --> 21:16.874
Nicky.
...and you'll love it.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.975
Please. I'm telling you,
you'll just go cra...

21:17.977 --> 21:20.011
Please.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.648
There's not
gonna be a next time.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.289
How long?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.026
Not long.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.831
Nicky, it's okay.
I've made peace with it.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.769
Did you tell Steve and Mary?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.404
No.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.939
And I-I'm not going to, uh...

21:48.941 --> 21:51.008
When I told them the first time,
they were devastated.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.610
Especially Mary.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.613
I... I'm not gonna
put 'em through that again.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.950
Is there...
anything that I can do?

21:59.952 --> 22:02.386
Yeah, there is one thing.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.387
Name it.

22:03.389 --> 22:05.956
(sighs):
Okay. After I'm gone,

22:05.958 --> 22:08.392
Steve is gonna need
someone in his life

22:08.394 --> 22:09.794
with a little wisdom.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.630
I'll be there.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.932
Actually, I was going to ask
if you knew someone.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.802
(laughs)

22:17.804 --> 22:19.804
Very funny.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.006
Yeah, I know you're
gonna be there for him.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.874
Thank you.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.879
You know, your friendship has
meant everything to me, Nicky.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.448
WAITER:
Excuse me.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.882
Can I get you
anything else?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.551
Oh, yes, anything you haven't had.
What?!

22:33.553 --> 22:35.119
Come on!
What do you want to do,

22:35.121 --> 22:38.089
take me with you? My arteries
are getting hard as we speak.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.825
Oh, we haven't had
the jalapeño poppers

22:40.827 --> 22:42.560
or the fried zucchini.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.028
That would be g...
Oh, and also,

22:44.030 --> 22:45.696
would you bring my friend here

22:45.698 --> 22:47.365
(groans)
some cholesterol medication?

22:47.367 --> 22:48.366
(laughs):
Very well.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.500
Cheers.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.074
All right, thanks.
That was Eric.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.876
The tire treads
at the crime scene

22:58.878 --> 23:00.878
belong to a
Nissan NV1500.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.880
HPD's flagged
all the plates,

23:02.882 --> 23:04.882
and Duke's got unis
going door-to-door.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.484
Should be just a
matter of time

23:06.486 --> 23:07.852
before we talk to every
registered owner.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.854
Time is something
we don't have.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.589
Hey. All right, who
we looking at here?

23:11.591 --> 23:13.858
So, we got a hit on the DNA
profile that Max sent out.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.926
Remains in the bunker
belong to 2nd Lieutenant

23:15.928 --> 23:18.796
Aki Hiroda-- which
is interesting,

23:18.798 --> 23:21.866
considering that
the Japanese army lists him

23:21.868 --> 23:24.769
as killed in action in the
Battle of Changsha, China,

23:24.771 --> 23:25.970
in the spring of 1940.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.938
So what,
they faked his death?

23:27.940 --> 23:29.974
Or they gave him a new life.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.976
The KIA story is
classic espionage stuff.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.445
They kill Hiroda on paper,
then they send him out here

23:34.447 --> 23:37.014
to work as an agent with a new identity.
All right, well,

23:37.016 --> 23:39.049
there's no way that Fugo was
a one-man operation.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.818
They had to have
other players involved.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.486
That's a safe bet.
Also safe to assume

23:42.488 --> 23:44.989
that our perp has a close
connection with one of them,

23:44.991 --> 23:46.574
maybe even Hiroda himself.

23:46.575 --> 23:48.158
Otherwise, how would he know
about this secret bunker

23:48.161 --> 23:50.795
and what was inside of it?
Yeah, it would also explain

23:50.797 --> 23:52.430
why they tried
to take all the bones--

23:52.432 --> 23:54.549
they didn't want us
getting an I.D.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.667
Yeah, and we did get an I.D.-- it's
still gonna be hard to link someone

23:56.669 --> 23:58.436
to that bunker. Steve's right.
We've also got to find

23:58.438 --> 23:59.670
the alias
that Hiroda was working under.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.971
I'll get that.  ABBY:  How?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.007
It's not like the
Japanese consulate's

24:03.009 --> 24:04.508
gonna voluntarily
turn over information

24:04.510 --> 24:05.910
regarding an attack
on this country.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.779
I'm not gonna ask them.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.852
(electronic chime)

24:14.854 --> 24:17.054
Looks like Liani's
gonna be okay.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.923
He was just moved
to recovery.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.091
Oh, that's excellent.
Yeah. Doctors said that

24:21.093 --> 24:24.094
he may be able to be questioned
in a few hours. Good.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.731
How are you holding up?

24:27.733 --> 24:30.734
Um... hanging in there. Thanks.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.037
What about Adam?

24:33.039 --> 24:35.873
He's keeping his head down,
doing his time.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.475
You know, so far
the other inmates

24:37.477 --> 24:39.076
seem to be giving him
plenty of space.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.579
I was worried that he'd
be a target in there

24:41.581 --> 24:43.781
'cause of me,
but it looks like

24:43.783 --> 24:45.616
being the son
of Hiro Noshimuri

24:45.618 --> 24:49.053
matters a lot more
than being married to a cop.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.055
Hey, listen, you
make sure Adam knows

24:51.057 --> 24:53.190
that if he needs
anything at all...

24:53.192 --> 24:54.658
All right?

24:54.660 --> 24:56.093
Thanks.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.933
Hey, hey, hey.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.102
That's my guy.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.016
All right, here we go.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.218
Hiroda's spy name
was Saburo Mori.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.654
He came here
on a temporary visa

25:23.656 --> 25:26.190
to work the sugar plantations
in the summer of 1940.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.058
Except he wasn't here
to harvest sugarcane;

25:28.060 --> 25:29.760
he was here to stage
a terrorist attack.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.829
Right. After Pearl Harbor,

25:31.831 --> 25:33.097
Japanese intelligence assumed
he'd been arrested

25:33.099 --> 25:34.999
or rounded up
and sent to an internment camp,

25:35.001 --> 25:36.967
but there was
no record of that.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.802
Then, after the fall
of 1941,

25:38.804 --> 25:40.938
there was no record
of him at all.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.573
Until this morning.
Right.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.174
My contact said
that these

25:44.176 --> 25:45.776
are all the classified documents

25:45.778 --> 25:48.746
related to Operation Fugo,
including names of other agents

25:48.748 --> 25:50.047
who were part of the program

25:50.049 --> 25:52.249
when it was here on Oahu
being developed.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.018
That's microfilm.
Yeah.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.087
I haven't even seen that stuff
since I was in grade school.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.956
Wait, can the table read that?

25:58.958 --> 26:01.325
No, the table can't read it.
We need a projector.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.794
And where do you suppose
we'll get that from?

26:03.796 --> 26:07.231
I'll have the projector back
before you close. I swear it.

26:07.233 --> 26:11.168
Like you brought back
<i> The Doubt Factory</i> and...

26:11.170 --> 26:12.703
<i> Alien Agenda:</i>

26:12.705 --> 26:16.006
<i> Investigating</i>
<i> Extraterrestrials Among Us?</i>

26:16.008 --> 26:18.042
Okay, those books were stolen
from my basement

26:18.044 --> 26:19.643
by a British terrorist.

26:19.645 --> 26:22.012
Along with your tinfoil hat,

26:22.014 --> 26:24.131
I'm sure.

26:24.132 --> 26:26.249
Look, I get it if you don't want
to do this for me,

26:26.252 --> 26:29.086
but how about being a good
citizen and doing it for Five-O?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.121
For $63.49

26:31.123 --> 26:34.124
in late fees,
I'll be a good citizen.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.194
As we discussed, I'm a little
short on cash at the moment.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.129
And I'm short...

26:39.131 --> 26:41.131
on microfilm projectors.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.700
Are you serious?
It's a dead technology.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.134
Who's using it?
Not you.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.604
All right, lady,
I didn't want to do this,

26:46.606 --> 26:47.871
but you forced me.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.074
We're on the verge
of a catastrophe

26:50.076 --> 26:51.241
of biblical proportions.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.143
Dozens of
Japanese-made bombs

26:53.145 --> 26:54.712
were stolen by some wack job

26:54.714 --> 26:56.880
who already tried to kill a kid
this morning.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.782
<i> And</i> without receiving
any demands,

26:58.784 --> 27:01.352
we're thinking he may just want
to blow up the island

27:01.354 --> 27:03.253
with said
weapons of mass destruction.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.056
So if you selfishly want
to stand in the way

27:06.058 --> 27:09.727
and take on the responsibility
of a million lives, be my guest.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.172
HPD sector car patrolling Manoa

27:22.174 --> 27:24.074
just went in pursuit
of a Nissan van.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.877
Could be our guy. Stand down.
Have them stand down.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.245
We don't have aviation up yet.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.380
Let it go.
I'm telling you,

27:29.382 --> 27:30.881
those bombs are
already unstable.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.249
A pursuit could trigger
a detonation,

27:32.251 --> 27:33.334
and in that neighborhood,

27:33.335 --> 27:34.418
there's gonna be
mass casualties.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.086
All right, we stand down,
we lose him.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.605
He's not gonna get far.

27:37.606 --> 27:39.123
Let's just wait till we got
those birds in position.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.125
Copy that.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.894
Duke, terminate the pursuit.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.864
I know, I know, but have all
units stand down immediately.

27:52.738 --> 27:55.139
(screaming, crying,
panicked shouts)

27:57.710 --> 28:00.177
(screaming, crying,
panicked shouts continue)

28:00.179 --> 28:02.680
(siren wailing)

28:10.356 --> 28:11.839
Hey, what happened?

28:11.840 --> 28:13.323
So, as soon as HPD pulled back,
the driver ditched his van

28:13.325 --> 28:15.259
and took off on foot.
As far as we know,

28:15.261 --> 28:16.760
the explosives are still inside.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.262
Wait a minute,
our perp had a clean getaway

28:18.264 --> 28:19.797
and he got out of the van
and bailed?

28:19.799 --> 28:20.998
Strange, right?

28:20.999 --> 28:22.198
We get a description
on this guy?

28:22.201 --> 28:23.818
Partial.
Two witnesses say

28:23.819 --> 28:25.436
he's male, he was wearing
a hat and sunglasses,

28:25.438 --> 28:26.904
so he could be anywhere between

28:26.906 --> 28:27.905
mid 20s and late 40s.

28:27.907 --> 28:28.906
All right, what about the van?

28:28.908 --> 28:29.973
We know anything about the van?

28:29.975 --> 28:31.275
It was reported stolen
last night.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.843

<i> Turns out the Navy had</i>

30:22.021 --> 30:23.520
some intel on our spy.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.855
According to them,

30:24.857 --> 30:26.423
Hiroda, aka Saburo Mori,

30:26.425 --> 30:28.492
had a handler here on Oahu.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.561
His name was Jiro Takaki.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.396
He worked at the
Consul General's Office

30:32.398 --> 30:35.132
as a diplomat, but
after Pearl Harbor

30:35.134 --> 30:37.835
he was picked up by Naval
Intelligence for questioning.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.138
INTERROGATOR:
Items we found in your home

30:41.140 --> 30:43.006
directly link you
to Saburo Mori.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.408
We also know Mr. Mori's planning

30:44.410 --> 30:47.144
some kind of attack
on the U.S. mainland.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.579
Now he's up and vanished.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.914
I'm gonna make this simple,
Mr. Takaki.

30:50.916 --> 30:54.051
I want to know
where Mr. Mori is right now.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.953
I want details on the attack:

30:55.955 --> 30:58.856
time, place and method.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.191
I cannot tell you

31:08.868 --> 31:10.634
I swear I'm telling the truth.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.636
I don't know where Mr. Mori is,

31:12.638 --> 31:14.438
and I don't know
operational details.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.474
I help with logistics
and money, that's it.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.577
All I can tell you is Mr. Mori
and I were supposed to meet

31:20.579 --> 31:22.479
at Natsunoya Teahouse last week.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.082
That's when he was going
to tell me his plan.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.250
But he didn't show.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.352
INTERROGATOR:
Who else is involved?

31:28.354 --> 31:30.287
I want names.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.322
There is no one else.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.358
Just Mr. Mori.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.027
Okay, spoiler alert--
Takaki's lying.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.529
According to documents
I found on the microfilm,

31:39.531 --> 31:41.598
there was one other person
involved in the plot.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.033
And that's this guy.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.568
Yuri Musaka.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.570
He was an officer
in the Imperial Japanese Navy

31:46.572 --> 31:48.672
who was sent here
around the same time as Hiroda.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.041
Oh, my God,
I can hardly keep up.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.043
Okay, so there's Hiroda...

31:53.045 --> 31:54.544
and now Takaki...

31:54.546 --> 31:56.480
and then here's Musaka.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.532
So that makes it
at last three guys

31:58.533 --> 32:00.583
who knew about this bunker
and knew the contents inside.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.386
Correct.
Okay, so we know

32:02.388 --> 32:04.521
that our shooter's probably
connected to one of them,

32:04.523 --> 32:05.956
and we're already
looking into Hiroda.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.457
What else can you tell us

32:07.459 --> 32:09.393
about the other two?
Unfortunately, not much.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.696
Takaki was sent back to Japan
after the war in a POW exchange.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.531
He died of cancer
two years later.

32:14.533 --> 32:15.999
There's no surviving family.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.000
How about Musaka?

32:17.002 --> 32:18.468
Still looking.
(sighs)

32:18.470 --> 32:21.238
Problem is, unlike Hiroda,
I don't have his alias--

32:21.240 --> 32:23.573
the legend he used
when he first got here.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.242
I've been combing
through the microfilm,

32:25.244 --> 32:26.610
but so far I've found nothing.

32:26.612 --> 32:27.845
Okay, well, keep digging.

me and Joanie--

33:35.581 --> 33:37.414
we'll go get the car, okay?
Okay, yeah.

33:37.416 --> 33:38.582
You can wait
here, all right?

33:38.584 --> 33:40.183
Oh, all right, sweetheart.
That sounds good.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.551
All right, I'll be right back.
Oh, Mary?

33:41.553 --> 33:43.070
Yeah. Take your
time, sweetheart.

33:43.071 --> 33:44.588
Uh, I've got something
I have to do first.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.622
Can I give you those?
Yeah.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.624
Okay.
Okay. You all right?

33:47.626 --> 33:48.658
Yeah, I'm fine. Okay.
Are you sure?

33:48.660 --> 33:50.193
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.762
Take your time. All
right, I'll be right back.

33:51.764 --> 33:52.930
Okay.
Okay.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.097
(Joan chattering)
MARY: Yeah.

33:54.099 --> 33:55.332
(sighs)

33:55.334 --> 33:57.501
Thank you.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.250
Hello. Uh, I'd like
to talk to someone

34:13.252 --> 34:16.053
about an asset transfer.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.724
Hey, I got your message.
You have something for me?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.592
You know it, Lou.
What?

34:22.594 --> 34:24.361
Short for "lieutenant."

34:24.363 --> 34:27.130
Don't you find that
a tad bit confusing,

34:27.132 --> 34:29.699
considering Captain Grover's
first name is Lou?

34:31.403 --> 34:32.836
Yeah, you might be right.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.539
Let's just stick
with Lieutenant Kelly.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.391
Copy that.
What have you got?

34:37.392 --> 34:39.242
Found a fresh print on that
old pistol you guys recovered.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.445
Pretty good chance it belongs
to whomever shot the kid.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.813
Ran it through AFIS,
came up snake eyes.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.648
But I did find a different
set of prints on the bullets

34:44.650 --> 34:46.716
inside the magazine.
Pretty sure

34:46.718 --> 34:48.752
these babies were left
there over 75 years ago.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.754
I was able to lift them during
a process called cyanoacrylate

34:50.756 --> 34:53.090
fuming, ironically a technique
invented by the Japanese.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.125
Eric... did you get a hit?

34:56.161 --> 34:58.495
Indeed I did.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.263
CHIN: So the prints
that Eric lifted

35:00.265 --> 35:01.765
came back
to this guy.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.166
Recognize him?

35:03.168 --> 35:05.168
KONA: Yeah, that's
Hiroda's coconspirator,

35:05.170 --> 35:06.736
Yuri Musaka.
Right.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.839
Except when he got
to Oahu in 1941,

35:08.841 --> 35:11.208
he was using
the name Youshi Tamuro.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.810
Now, the only reason his prints
are in the system to begin with

35:13.812 --> 35:17.347
is because, from 1942 to 1946,

35:17.349 --> 35:19.516
he was a prisoner at
Honouliuli Internment Camp.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.717
And it gets better.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.185
Now, Musaka,

35:22.187 --> 35:23.887
still using the name "Tamuro,"

35:23.889 --> 35:26.156
stayed on the island
even after the war ended.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.692
In 1947, the guy
got married.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.660
In 1949, he started
a construction business.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.696
And then, just three days ago,

35:32.698 --> 35:35.365
at the age of 100,
he passed away.

35:38.337 --> 35:41.471
So Musaka kills his partner
in cold blood.

35:41.473 --> 35:45.275
Then he stays here living
under the radar for 75 years.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.844
And now, after all this time,
he dies,

35:47.846 --> 35:50.747
and somebody goes right to the
secret bunker and cleans it out.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.182
Anybody else thinking
what I'm thinking?

35:52.184 --> 35:53.750
Yeah, this was never
about the bombs.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.886
Whoever shot Liani
went in there

35:55.888 --> 35:57.821
to destroy anything
that would tie Musaka

35:57.823 --> 35:59.756
to the spy ring
or Operation Fugo.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.358
All right,
for all we know, they had

36:01.360 --> 36:02.559
every intention
of discarding those bombs.

36:02.561 --> 36:05.462
I think I may know
who that person is.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.565
I looked into
Musaka's next of kin.

36:08.567 --> 36:09.733
He's survived by two daughters,

36:09.735 --> 36:11.334
both of whom live
on the mainland,

36:11.336 --> 36:15.805
and a grandson
who lives here on the island.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.407
His name is
Kyle Tamuro.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.442
And according to
his social media,

36:19.444 --> 36:21.344
he and his grandfather
are very close.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.812
Chin, ping his phone.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.915
(computer chirping
and trilling)

36:24.917 --> 36:26.416
I got him.

36:26.418 --> 36:27.817
Where is he?

36:27.819 --> 36:29.886
He's in the building.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.265
Hey! (whistles)

36:43.235 --> 36:44.601
Kyle Tamuro.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.536
On your knees right now.
Put your hands behind your head.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.672
Please. Please. Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.373
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.375
I came here to tell you
this was all a mistake.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.314
<i> I was in the bunker</i>
<i> cleaning out the place.</i>

36:57.316 --> 37:00.350
<i> No one had been there</i>
<i> since the war.</i>

37:00.352 --> 37:02.852
<i> I didn't think anyone else</i>
<i> even knew that it existed.</i>

37:04.656 --> 37:06.423
(door closes)
<i> But then I heard a noise.</i>

37:06.425 --> 37:08.358
<i> Someone was coming in.</i>

37:08.360 --> 37:09.526
<i> And there wasn't</i>
<i> any other way out.</i>

37:09.528 --> 37:11.728
<i> I was trapped.</i>

37:14.499 --> 37:15.498
(two gunshots)

37:15.500 --> 37:17.334
Look, all I saw

37:17.336 --> 37:19.436
was someone holding a knife,
and I panicked.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.937
Look, I'm so sorry.

37:20.939 --> 37:24.241
I was only trying to protect
my grandfather's legacy.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.742
That bunker was
hidden for 75 years.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.444
You could have
just left it alone.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.878
No, I couldn't.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.513
I mean, that area is about
to be developed.

37:30.515 --> 37:33.283
My family's company was
asked to submit a bid.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.018
When I mentioned it
to my grandfather,

37:35.020 --> 37:36.987
that's when
he revealed the truth.

37:36.989 --> 37:39.723
Confessed he had been a spy
for the Japanese government.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.358
And a killer.
Let's not forget that.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.027
It was kill or be killed.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.795
He said, when it came time
to do the mission,

37:45.797 --> 37:46.997
he had a change of heart.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.865
He went to Hiroda,
tried to get him

37:48.867 --> 37:50.500
to stand down,
but Hiroda wouldn't hear of it.

37:50.502 --> 37:53.270
There was a struggle
inside the bunker.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.273
My grandfather had no choice.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.609
He did what he had to do
to stay alive.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.445
Look, he was a proud man.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.682
He didn't want anyone
to know about his past.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.519
He didn't want
to bring shame on our family.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.624
Okay, get up.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.760
(panting)

38:16.762 --> 38:18.495
How's the boy?

38:19.498 --> 38:20.830
He's all right.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.666
He's got a long road
ahead of him.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.438
Please tell his parents
I'm very sorry.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.043
(knocking)
JERRY:<i> Yeah?</i>

38:34.513 --> 38:36.546
Hey, Jer.
Commander.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.015
We, uh... we closed the case.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.484
You know that, right?
Yeah, Chin texted me.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.954
Yet you are still going through
the old files.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.324
Yeah, well, it's not every day
you get to look

38:47.326 --> 38:48.692
at unredacted government files
from the '40s.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.328
Oh. This is like
Christmas morning for you.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.430
It's better.
Hey, uh, Jerry,

38:53.432 --> 38:55.498
you know you're not gonna find
anything on Roswell in there,

38:55.500 --> 38:56.866
right? Course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.034
These are Navy files.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.503
Air Force covered
up Roswell.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.339
Right. Uh, okay.

39:02.341 --> 39:05.508
Anyway, I just... I just wanted
to come and say good job,

39:05.510 --> 39:07.477
and, uh, you know?

39:07.479 --> 39:09.012
Good job.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.014
Appreciate it.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.049
Hey, did you know the
Naval Investigative Service

39:13.051 --> 39:15.752
kept Musaka under surveillance
even after the war was over?

39:15.754 --> 39:17.587
No, I didn't know that.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.489
Check it out.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.390
Obviously, they only knew him
as Youshi Tamuro,

39:21.393 --> 39:23.026
but they considered him
a person of interest.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.427
Kept tabs on
him for years.

39:24.429 --> 39:26.429
But the guy was
a model citizen,

39:26.431 --> 39:28.765
put down roots, even married
a local girl-- Olina Hoku.

39:28.767 --> 39:31.868
They actually met before
Pearl Harbor, but they stayed

39:31.870 --> 39:34.437
in touch the entire time he
was in the internment camp.

39:34.439 --> 39:36.439
Wait a minute.

39:36.441 --> 39:39.943
She's the reason
he changed his mind.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.978
Look, Musaka came here
for one purpose,

39:41.980 --> 39:44.814
and that was
to do us harm, right?

39:44.816 --> 39:46.416
Then he falls for this girl.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.917
And in the end, his love for her

39:47.919 --> 39:49.886
outweighed his loyalty
to his country.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.822
Love's a pretty powerful thing.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.593
Yes, it is.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.666
STEVE:
<i> That is beautiful, Joanie.</i>

40:03.668 --> 40:05.668
<i> Look at that. </i>
(Joan giggles, chatters)

40:05.670 --> 40:07.971
Yes. Do some spirals.
Do another one.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.592
Hey, you should
flip that.

40:12.593 --> 40:14.009
Okay, well, I know my pancakes,
and I'll flip it when I'm ready.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.879
It's bubbling. It's just,

40:15.881 --> 40:17.680
when it's bubbling,
it's ready to be flipped.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.783
Wow. Micromanage much?
Hey. You don't need

40:19.785 --> 40:22.018
to get all Danny Williams on me.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.187
All right, well, if you want to
be helpful, then why don't you

40:24.189 --> 40:26.423
go wake up Aunt Deb and tell her
breakfast is ready?

40:26.424 --> 40:28.285
You mean burned, right?
It's not gonna be burned.

40:28.311 --> 40:29.158
You're gonna love it.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.028
Okay, hold on. JOAN: Uh-oh.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.564
(Joan chatters)
Joanie, listen to me, okay?

40:34.566 --> 40:35.865
Keep an eye
on your mother.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.534
She's got that weird
look in her eye.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.169
I don't want her to burn the house down.
Oh, my gosh.

40:39.171 --> 40:40.637
Go!
All right?

40:40.639 --> 40:41.938
(laughing):
Stop.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.274
(whispering):
Joanie, watch her.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.609
(whispering): Don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him.
