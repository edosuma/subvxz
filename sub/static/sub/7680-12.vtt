00:05.920 --> 00:11.400
There are some places in this world that are a lot easier to get into than out of...

00:11.400 --> 00:16.480
like East Berlin, for instance.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.760
I mean, look at me.

00:24.120 --> 00:35.120
I'm dying to leave.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.520
So far, so good.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.560
But the next part's where it could get a little touchy.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.200
My grief-stricken mourners here to lend a helping hand.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.000
Gettin' a little warm in here.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.440
- Open the gate
- Vorsicht!

02:18.000 --> 02:21.400
Kannst du bitte helfen?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.920
Danke schoen.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.000
Hier Kontrol. Ja wohl!

02:41.560 --> 02:44.840
Ja wohl! Ja wohl!

02:44.840 --> 02:50.000
Huh-oh. Sounds like trouble.

03:39.280 --> 03:47.160
I guess this makes me about the first guy who ever attended his own funeral and lived to tell about it.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.480
M A C G Y V E R
Episode 1x12 DEATHLOCK

04:43.480 --> 04:46.360
We have reviewed your proposal.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.920
Yes, sir! It is correct in every detail.

04:49.920 --> 04:55.640
We have had assurances like this from you in the past, Quayle, particularly where they concern MacGyver.

04:55.640 --> 05:00.160
MacGyver is the only blemish on my records, gentlemen.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.960
- I have never failed you in anything except...
- We know that dreary story, Quayle.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.800
He made a fool of you. Of us.

05:08.800 --> 05:14.200
He was lucky. Extremely lucky.
And I admit I underestimated him.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.120
But this time I'm ready for him.
I can guarantee you success.

05:18.120 --> 05:22.600
You guarantee? To neutralize the information he took from us in East Berlin?

05:22.600 --> 05:24.280
Absolutely.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.600
Promises. Always promises.
We must have results.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.520
We must prevent that information from reaching American intelligence.

05:31.520 --> 05:36.080
- Consider it done.
- And suppose you fail again?

05:36.080 --> 05:37.160
I won't.

05:37.160 --> 05:43.240
I see you remember what happened to you after your last failure.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.440
Yes, sir. I remember.

05:46.440 --> 05:51.960
Then let that memory be an inspiration, Quayle.
Let it guide you in your efforts.

05:51.960 --> 05:57.320
What he means, Quayle, is this is your chance for redemption.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.080
And it's definitely your last chance.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.800
- I understand - thank you, sir.
- Good.

06:03.800 --> 06:11.000
It is the decision of this tribunal to authorize your operation... based on your personal guarantee.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.360
Thank you, sir. Thank you!
You won't regret it.

06:14.360 --> 06:20.160
I appreciate the opportunity to redeem myself in your eyes, to reestablish my value in the cause...

06:20.160 --> 06:22.120
Better get started, Quayle.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.600
Our sources have traced MacGyver halfway around the world.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.120
He's about to return home.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.720
I'll be waiting.

07:32.360 --> 07:37.440
Baby!

07:37.440 --> 07:39.720
You look terrific!

07:39.720 --> 07:43.960
Boy, is it good to see you!
What a sight!

07:43.960 --> 07:47.760
Especially with the three heavies that are setting you up for a hit.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.720
Peter Thornton sent me.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.080
How's the General?

07:54.080 --> 07:57.200
Generally good, except Thornton is a colonel.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.320
And he asked me to remind you that he owes you a camel.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.800
And you came all the way down here just to tell me that?

08:04.800 --> 08:08.000
Oh, sweet Lulubelle.

08:11.720 --> 08:17.120
I love this girl! I love her! She's great!
I love, I love her! You'd love her, too.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.960
- Let's go, Lulubelle.
- Name's Karen Blake.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.240
Look more like a Lulubelle to me.
So how's Peter?

08:23.240 --> 08:27.560
Waiting for you. So hold on, lover!

08:33.480 --> 08:39.320
- Aren't we goin' to Pete's office?
- No, he set up a special safe house.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.880
You been with the Company long?

08:49.880 --> 08:55.080
- Why?
- Well, I thought I knew all the pretty girls in the office.

08:55.080 --> 09:00.800
Business must be good.
Since when do safe houses look like this?

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Look, I was just told to bring you here for a high-level debriefing.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.160
High level lives in high places.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.880
I've just got one question.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.840
- Hey, I'm only a courier.
- I'm only hungry. When do we eat?

09:18.840 --> 09:23.480
Good to see you again... MacGyver.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.720
Quaint.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.120
We thought so.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.880
Pete!

09:32.680 --> 09:35.000
- Great!
- Good to see you!

09:35.000 --> 09:38.320
And I thought all secret agents were cold and heartless.

09:38.320 --> 09:43.240
No, Pete and I go way back to some pretty funny places.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.000
Is that what the camel was about?

09:45.000 --> 09:50.520
Well, the first time I met this fella, he pulled me out of the quicksand in the Wadi Nefud.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.960
Deep desert.

09:51.960 --> 09:57.080
Then he put me on a camel and he gave it this gigantic swat. Ha!

09:57.080 --> 09:59.880
- What happened?
- Oh, we just rode on out.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.280
Yeah, for six days.
I couldn't sit easy for a week.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.720
Anyway, it's good to see you.
And congratulations.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.840
You had some problems getting out of East Berlin.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.080
Uh, yeah. Had some real unfriendlies waitin' for me.

10:11.080 --> 10:15.640
- I sorta had to cut and run for the border.
- Turned a coffin into a jet ski.

10:15.640 --> 10:19.600
Yeah, that part was fun.
I had a real good time.

10:19.600 --> 10:24.440
- Me and, uh, junior here.
- That is very important. So, thanks.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.480
You're welcome.
And congratulations to yourself.

10:27.480 --> 10:31.400
I heard... Deputy Chief of the Department.
Big deal.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.200
- You can call me sir.
- Yeah, I noticed.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.160
This place?
Yeah, it's been out of use for quite a while.

10:38.160 --> 10:42.120
Off the list and unofficial...
which is exactly what we need.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.760
It seems we have a very large hole in departmental security.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.680
- What leaked?
- Your name. And what you brought back.

10:49.680 --> 10:54.200
- Terrific.
- So I'm handling it personally from here on.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.600
Here, now, and quietly.
My own office doesn't even know we're here.

10:58.600 --> 11:02.960
- No one does. It's perfect.
- Yes, it is.

11:03.680 --> 11:09.480
- Right in here.
- Cozy.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.040
Thought you'd appreciate it.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.160
And in a way it fits.
We are hunting big game.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.920
Dangerous game.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.520
You know Mrs. Chung?

11:17.520 --> 11:20.040
By reputation. It's a pleasure.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.000
How do you do?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.200
The best crypt analyst alive.

11:23.200 --> 11:28.440
Oh, Peter, stop it! He's a politician.
I solve puzzles.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.600
And, uh, I understand you have brought us one today.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.840
Yes, Ma'am.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.160
Should I be here, sir?

11:34.160 --> 11:38.080
Oh yes, we're all staying right here until Mrs. Chung decodes the microfilm.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.880
Thank you. This computer is fully programmed for our system, MacGyver.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.360
Well, that's fine with me.
I just came for lunch.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.680
I have not activated it!

11:53.040 --> 11:54.520
What in hell is this?

11:54.520 --> 11:59.880
A joke, Peter.
Trick or treat. It's April Fool's.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.840
Peter! Peter!

12:22.960 --> 12:28.800
Don't touch that door!

12:30.160 --> 12:33.360
Hello, MacGyver. Long time no see.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.160
Make the lady comfortable and don't worry about her, MacGyver.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.160
She's not dead, only sedated.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.400
He knows you. Who is he?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.040
Use the name Quayle.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.560
Sold the British out to the Russians.
Double-crossed the Russians for the Ayatollah.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.320
Ah ha ha, those dear fun days.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.040
I ran into him movin' a planeload of stolen military computers.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.000
What happened?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.360
Uh, I stole the plane back.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.320
Your people weren't too happy with you, huh, Quayle?

13:02.320 --> 13:05.880
No, they punished me... because of you.

13:05.880 --> 13:12.160
But now, this is my game, my board, my rules.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.240
Security leak a little bigger than you thought?

13:14.240 --> 13:16.000
As big as a house.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.480
- For this?
- No, no, no.

13:17.480 --> 13:22.520
No, I was commissioned to destroy it and deal with you.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.520
No!

13:23.520 --> 13:26.680
Frightened, Karen? All in a day's work.

13:26.680 --> 13:33.080
And in your case, with great pleasure, MacGyver.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.440
Peter Thornton here.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.760
Don't be stupid!
But do be adventurous!

13:42.760 --> 13:47.680
Try to escape. Try to find me! Please!

13:47.680 --> 13:49.480
Don't touch anything, Peter.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.760
- What do you mean?
- Ah, he's got the whole place rigged.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.800
- To kill us?
- Yeah. Sooner or later.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.720
- First the man wants to have some fun.
- MacGyver, that's crazy!

14:00.720 --> 14:03.520
- So is Quayle.
- His gears don't mesh.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.400
Let's see if we can get outta here.
Maybe he's missed a trick or two.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.400
I don't wanna leave Mrs. Chung back there very long.

14:10.400 --> 14:15.040
The best thing we can do for her is to get to Karen's car and get some help.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.880
No! Where's my car?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.320
Damn! It's gone!

14:32.080 --> 14:35.880
- Well, that's scary stuff.
- The door has got to be booby-trapped.

14:35.880 --> 14:41.840
Yeah. Let's see if we can figure out how.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.840
It's not electrified.

15:10.560 --> 15:16.000
- I don't believe it.
- I don't either.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.160
- Gonna run a test, huh?
- Yeah.

16:03.240 --> 16:07.880
A hit, MacGyver! A palpable hit!

16:07.880 --> 16:10.560
You always did like to talk, didn't ya, Quayle?

16:10.560 --> 16:17.040
Karen, give me that sheet.
It's an incredible weakness of yours.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.520
Kitchen.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.760
Always had to say how great you were, didn't ya, Quayle?

16:29.760 --> 16:33.680
- Afraid maybe people wouldn't notice.
- You'll be the last one to die.

16:33.680 --> 16:39.240
That's what I figure, too.
Of old age, hopefully.

16:45.280 --> 16:50.000
- Well, here it is.
- Why here?

16:50.000 --> 16:54.800
You can find lots of handy stuff in the kitchen.
Let's look around.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.400
Still with us, big guy?
You certainly are talented, Quayle.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.200
- I mean, this guy has got it!
- Got us, you mean!

17:03.200 --> 17:06.640
Like pigeons in a coop.
Like rats in a trap.

17:06.640 --> 17:11.200
I have never been nailed down so tight in my entire life.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.119
Your appreciation is not wasted, MacGyver.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.200
Quayle... Take your bows, gent.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.440
It's not every day I run into pure perfection.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.400
Let's just say you were my perfect challenge.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.640
Yeah, you certainly have met that challenge.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.240
He is definitely back at the top of his form.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.680
A new chess game with a new master, MacGyver.

17:30.680 --> 17:36.640
You got that straight.
Brilliance, Quayle. Pure brilliance.

17:36.640 --> 17:44.120
Compliment acknowledged, but you aren't going to give up so easily, are you?

17:46.120 --> 17:47.960
What's that fidgeting you're up to?

17:47.960 --> 17:51.440
Messing around with pots and pans won't help you.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.520
So why don't you just put away the tinker toys...

17:54.520 --> 18:00.360
- ... and play the game?
- Absolutely. Positively.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.200
Let the games begin.

18:02.200 --> 18:07.640
Quayle was listening on a radio frequency, so I figured by using every electronic gadget around,

18:07.640 --> 18:13.360
I could heterodyne his frequency and give the man an earful of static.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.120
- MacGyver!
- You built an electronic jammer!

18:32.120 --> 18:36.920
Yep! Quayle's gonna get nothin' but white noise. So we got a little privacy in here.

18:36.920 --> 18:42.360
All right, I figure if we split up and keep movin' around this house, I can find a way to bust out while he's not lookin'.

18:42.360 --> 18:48.960
- Keep him busy tracking the three of us?
- My radiophone! It's in the library in my case.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.120
- If I can get to it without Quayle watching.
- Nice touch.

18:52.120 --> 18:56.320
Okay, here we go. One at a time.
Keep him guessing.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.040
Stay low, move fast, think smart, and...

18:59.040 --> 19:05.880
- ... if you go, take company along.
- Get outta here!

19:43.360 --> 19:45.240
Deputy Chief Peter Thornton.

19:45.240 --> 19:50.520
Red. Red. Repeat, red. Red. Details...

19:50.520 --> 19:53.800
But I already know the details, Peter.

20:06.200 --> 20:11.880
Now I guess it's my turn to go out and distract Quayle.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.800
Hey...

20:19.800 --> 20:22.000
it's gonna be all right.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
We're gonna make it.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.160
Heh, thanks, I needed that.

20:34.160 --> 20:38.800
Come on, let's get outta here.
Whatta you say?

21:01.640 --> 21:10.360
Quayle was a thorough kind of guy, so it figured he had all the windows and doors either booby-trapped or covered by the guns outside.

21:10.360 --> 21:21.760
But maybe I could make myself a set of wheels that'd draw his fire... get me outta this homemade prison.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.640
I'm listening to your symphony, MacGyver. Or is it a requiem?

21:27.640 --> 21:33.600
When I was a kid, I used to build model planes with rubber band motors.

21:33.600 --> 21:42.520
Then I discovered batteries.
It sure did increase the mileage.

21:51.080 --> 21:57.440
Ah, my dear Karen. Welcome to my fortress.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.840
It's going rather well, don't you think?

21:59.840 --> 22:03.840
Well, Quayle, I really didn't expect all this to be happening.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.960
I mean, you said this was gonna be over quickly.

22:05.960 --> 22:10.160
It will be. But you mustn't deny me my brief moment of fun.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.800
Fun? I'm shaking!

22:12.800 --> 22:15.440
Are you afraid they might find you out?

22:15.440 --> 22:18.720
Who could suspect such a darling innocent?

22:18.720 --> 22:23.120
But this MacGyver is, is very smart.
And Thornton is no dummy either.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.600
Yes, that's what makes you my, uh, what shall I call you?

22:26.600 --> 22:30.080
My little mole. No, that's far too unflattering.

22:30.080 --> 22:34.800
My perfect collaborator in this delicious charade.

22:34.800 --> 22:40.240
I'm telling you, Quayle, I'm scared... of them and of you.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.320
You said that we were just gonna do a simple job without hurt.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.640
I'm just teasing. Just toying with them.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.840
- But Mrs. Chung is down...
- She's a stranger.

22:47.840 --> 22:54.160
There's someone much closer to you that you ought to be worried about.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.760
All right. I'll do what you say.

22:57.760 --> 23:01.800
Perfect! Now what is MacGyver doing in the kitchen?

23:01.800 --> 23:04.720
When I left him, he was taking the motor out of a blender.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.840
Ah, yes, that's the handyman side of MacGyver.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.240
He likes to make clever little things out of odd bits.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.000
- But I must have more details.
- I must know exactly what he is doing!

23:14.000 --> 23:18.560
- I'll go see.
- Yes, you do that, my dear. No time to waste.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.520
The sooner we deal with MacGyver, the sooner this'll be over.

23:22.520 --> 23:29.040
There's my perfect collaborator. Stay in touch.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.880
What sort of a fantasy is MacGyver indulging?

24:34.880 --> 24:39.320
Answer me, Karen. Are you there?

24:39.320 --> 24:45.480
Yes. He's at the, uh, rear kitchen door and he's built some kind of wheeled cart with a piece of the suit of armor on top.

24:45.480 --> 24:50.240
It's the position I care about!
He'll be coming out of the back door...

24:50.240 --> 24:53.080
And I'll be waiting for him.
Very good, Karen.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.680
- What're you gonna do?
- Dear...

24:55.680 --> 25:02.760
Sweet Karen, I only intend to embarrass them painfully... even MacGyver.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.040
Especially MacGyver.

26:46.920 --> 26:52.080
Obviously the guns are target to shoot at a given height, at anything that moves.

26:52.080 --> 26:58.800
But they can't shoot in two directions at once, so if I can get 'em aiming down there...

27:22.080 --> 27:24.880
Quayle! I think he's gotten clear.

27:24.880 --> 27:28.920
Don't worry...
I'll get him back, Karen.

27:29.400 --> 27:35.080
MacGyver, come back!
I've got Thornton!

27:35.080 --> 27:39.800
You want to see Thornton alive?
Now is the time.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.280
He's waiting for you in the trophy room.

27:42.280 --> 27:48.520
I've turned my guns off so you can come back.

27:49.160 --> 27:55.960
The game is not over... yet.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.360
He's coming back to us, Karen.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.400
But did I detect a note of concern for MacGyver?

28:10.400 --> 28:14.840
We can't afford a major incident, like a multiple-VIP murder.

28:14.840 --> 28:20.560
Look, my orders are to retrieve a piece of intelligence, not to carry out your damned blood feud!

28:20.560 --> 28:23.440
I give the orders, my girl!

28:23.440 --> 28:26.080
And I'm ordering you to the trophy room.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.840
You can get the roll of film from Thornton there.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.160
Now get going before MacGyver gets there!

28:32.160 --> 28:34.480
Thornton's not gonna give it to me!

28:34.480 --> 28:38.080
He won't object.
I've given him the shock of his life.

28:38.080 --> 28:43.080
- Now go on, girl!
- Right.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.720
He's dead! Electrocuted!

29:12.760 --> 29:19.200
- He's not dead.
- Oh my God! I thought...

29:24.200 --> 29:28.600
She's still the same.
They'll both be all right if we get 'em help in time.

29:28.600 --> 29:33.680
Yeah. MacGyver, I know you would've gotten away.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.440
It's all right. I changed my mind anyway.

29:36.440 --> 29:40.880
If I get away, Quayle gets away.
And I want him.

29:40.880 --> 29:45.360
Let's go somewhere where we can't be seen or heard.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.560
Quayle's got the house rigged electronically.

29:51.560 --> 29:55.360
The main power line which is probably in the basement.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.080
I saw some vinegar here. Yeah.

29:58.080 --> 30:03.880
Now if we can cut or control that power line, Quayle goes deaf, dumb and blind.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.920
He loses his edge.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.800
MacGyver, what the hell are we doing?

30:09.800 --> 30:16.480
- Making some preparations.
- MacGyver! /- Thank you.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.200
Now you want to tell me if Quayle hired you locally or were you assigned to him?

30:20.200 --> 30:24.200
It was an assignment.
How did you know?

30:24.200 --> 30:27.520
Well, first of all, you were a little too quick and cool gettin' me out of that hit.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.880
Now the hit men didn't even try to follow.

30:29.880 --> 30:35.400
Secondly, you took one look at Pete from across the room and assessed that he'd been electrocuted.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.000
You're very quick, MacGyver.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.920
Not quick enough to save Pete from a pretty good jolt.

30:39.920 --> 30:43.880
- It could've killed him, you know.
- I was told no killing.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.440
Only that we would get the film back.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.720
Why draw the line at murder?
Quayle doesn't.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.440
I didn't know that!
I've never worked with him before.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.480
- I told you they assigned me.
- For how much?

30:54.480 --> 30:57.360
How much money they givin' ya to betray your country? Huh?

30:57.360 --> 31:01.880
Money? It's not - I wouldn't do it for money!

31:01.880 --> 31:05.720
Look, I've never done anything like this before.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.600
Oh, please, don't tell me you're one of those political mal...

31:08.600 --> 31:12.760
They've got my brother!

31:15.200 --> 31:18.560
He works for Mr. Thornton, too.
For the Company.

31:18.560 --> 31:22.600
But he was on assignment in Czechoslovakia and he got caught.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.000
And they said they would kill him unless...

31:25.000 --> 31:31.840
Unless you cooperated. Work for them.

31:35.840 --> 31:39.760
There's another way, Karen.
You don't have to give into their blackmail.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.120
But my brother, he's my only family.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.920
Help me catch Quayle.
We'll use him as a bargaining chip.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.840
- Trade Quayle for your brother.
- What if they won't?

31:49.840 --> 31:54.200
Then I'll go in and get him. Personally.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.840
You would do that for me after... everything?

31:57.840 --> 32:00.520
Will you help me?

32:00.520 --> 32:01.560
What do you want me to do?

32:01.560 --> 32:05.160
Well, I think we should start by forcing Quayle out of his electronic fortress.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.640
- How?
- By unplugging all his gadgets.

32:08.640 --> 32:13.680
We've gotta get to the power room in the basement. Let's go.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.880
He could be anywhere.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.000
Or everywhere.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.400
You thought I couldn't track you, MacGyver.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.160
Well, we all make mistakes.

32:27.160 --> 32:31.160
This one is, I'm afraid, fatal.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.560
- Quayle!
- Goodbye, Karen.

32:42.560 --> 32:47.640
I'll try to arrange a posthumous medal.
Watch the moving dot.

32:47.640 --> 32:50.480
Whatever it touches, it kills.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.960
- Damn!
- Closer and...

32:51.960 --> 32:56.200
...closer. I could hit you at any time.

32:56.200 --> 33:01.480
These are your last moments.
So enjoy them.

33:06.640 --> 33:12.360
My daddy used to say you can't hit what you can't see.

33:19.040 --> 33:23.640
A smokescreen. That won't save you.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.840
Now we're invisible.

33:31.840 --> 33:36.320
Okay, follow me.

33:45.480 --> 33:50.920
Come on. The back stairs where Quayle can't see or hear us.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.240
Damn it!

34:01.000 --> 34:10.000
MacGyver! Karen!
There really is no escape.

34:11.760 --> 34:17.159
MacGyver! I know where Quayle is.
He's down that corridor to the right.

34:17.159 --> 34:20.600
His control room is down at the end.
The door is steel.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.960
He's got a lot of security and weapons.

34:22.960 --> 34:29.880
All right. Maybe it's time for him to come out and play.

34:46.960 --> 34:51.400
Hey! I've got an idea.

34:51.400 --> 34:55.040
Let's make an early warning system.
It'll let us know when Quayle's on the way.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.240
And what makes you so sure Quayle's gonna leave his control room?

34:58.240 --> 35:01.160
It's the only way to get to the power room. Right?

35:01.160 --> 35:06.640
Well, if we can cut off his electricity, he's bound to come lookin' for us.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.640
Easy.

36:00.800 --> 36:05.760
What're you gonna do?

36:05.760 --> 36:09.080
Invite the man to a party.

36:12.760 --> 36:18.800
- Rusted junk machinery... I don't get it.
- Line it up, Karen. Sorta casual clutter.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.760
What're you doing?
Those wires look like spaghetti.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.760
Well, I traced all the heavy wiring into Quayle's fortress.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.560
- So?
- I'm gonna punch his lights out.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.600
Keep stackin' that junk.

36:30.600 --> 36:37.280
When Quayle comes in here, he's gotta walk forward only one way.

36:43.360 --> 36:47.560
Oh, how's this?

36:47.560 --> 36:50.800
Perfect. Primrose path.

36:50.800 --> 36:55.320
Pull that cabinet over, too, will ya?

36:55.320 --> 36:59.920
You know, I sure could use a mirror.
Think you could find me one?

36:59.920 --> 37:04.960
Yeah, just what I want to do is look in a mirror right now.

37:08.520 --> 37:14.320
Okay, okay, I'll go find a mirror.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.040
- That's perfect. That's just what we need.
- So now we've got a mirror.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.760
Yeah, sort of. Come here.

37:37.760 --> 37:45.480
Stand right here. Don't move.

37:47.880 --> 37:52.960
Oh, I see. So you're making a periscope so we can see Quayle, right?

37:52.960 --> 37:56.560
Yeah, that's right. Without being seen.

37:56.560 --> 38:01.000
- Why?
- Because he'd probably blow us away.

38:01.000 --> 38:09.640
Where are you? You can't escape.
I'll find you. I'll find you.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.520
And we've got a mirror.

38:12.520 --> 38:17.960
And a kind of water cannon.
I don't wanna lose pressure.

38:17.960 --> 38:21.600
The problem we're gonna have, though, is gettin' him in and standing right there.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.000
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

38:23.000 --> 38:30.000
Where are they? Nothing! Nothing!

38:32.240 --> 38:35.800
Why aren't I finding them?

38:37.080 --> 38:42.520
We'll keep the lights on in here and in the corridor.

38:42.520 --> 38:49.640
And so... this must be his power.

38:58.480 --> 39:01.200
Power failure.

39:02.760 --> 39:06.480
Auxiliary generator.

39:08.160 --> 39:13.800
Your handy work, I suppose, MacGyver.
Damn it!

39:15.280 --> 39:22.760
You're right, MacGyver.
No more games.

39:31.040 --> 39:35.400
MacGyver...

39:48.880 --> 39:54.320
That was just in case.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.840
Nice thought.

41:04.080 --> 41:10.280
Out in clear sight now.

41:10.280 --> 41:17.880
Quayle! Thank God you found us!
MacGyver was setting a trap.

41:17.880 --> 41:24.520
- I thought I could trust you.
- We're on the same side, huh, Quayle?

41:24.520 --> 41:32.080
I'm a geometric rarity, my dear.
There's only one side. Myself.

41:32.080 --> 41:44.840
Gosh, Quayle, and all this time I thought you were just scum.

41:45.920 --> 41:53.320
This one's free of charge.

42:03.400 --> 42:10.360
- You took a big chance trusting me.
- That's what it's all about.

42:10.360 --> 42:13.160
All right, let's wrap him up and see how the rest are doin', all right?

42:13.160 --> 42:14.800
Okay.

42:14.800 --> 42:22.000
Yes, I think we've plugged the leak.
Quayle. That's right.

42:23.160 --> 42:29.560
I'm sorry. Now where were we?

42:30.080 --> 42:34.760
Oh yes, solving a puzzle.

42:34.760 --> 42:40.880
That's okay, Mrs. Chung.
I think we just took care of that.

42:44.240 --> 42:48.800
