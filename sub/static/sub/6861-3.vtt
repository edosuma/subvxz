WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:05.073
I'm from
BlueBell, Alabama.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.340
EMMELINE:
 Harley Wilkes was your father.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.609
What?
He left you
his practice.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.844
He shares it with Dr. Breeland,
 and Brick--

00:10.844 --> 00:12.046
he's been waiting
a long time

00:12.046 --> 00:14.082
to get BlueBell
all to himself.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.216
We haven't met.
I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.985
I'm not gonna share this
office, not for one minute.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.621
EMMELINE:
 Zoe, this is Lemon Breeland.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.989
You're Brick's daughter,
right?

00:21.989 --> 00:23.557
I'm, uh,
George Tucker.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.595
You're the mayor--
Lavon Hayes the linebacker?

00:27.595 --> 00:30.231
You share a generator with
the guy in the gatehouse--

00:30.231 --> 00:32.232
Wade Kinsella.
LEMON:
 You here on a date

00:32.232 --> 00:34.468
with that, uh, Dr. Hart?
If I do recall, we are

00:34.468 --> 00:36.504
at your engagement party.
LEMON:
 You know how difficult

00:36.504 --> 00:39.240
this is for me.
Difficult never stopped me.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.941
I can't see how you can contest

00:40.941 --> 00:42.143
Harley Wilkes' will.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.778
Find me a way.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.514
30% of the revenue
every billing quarter,

00:46.514 --> 00:49.650
the other partner
can buy him or her out.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.352
I apologize for what
I'm about to do.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.953
Wade, I need to
create a diversion.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.222
(screaming)

00:54.222 --> 00:56.090
LEMON:
 And I think I speak

00:56.090 --> 00:57.391
for everyone
when I say

00:57.391 --> 00:59.293
we don't want you here.

01:01.829 --> 01:02.830
(buzzing, crackling)

01:02.830 --> 01:04.831
ZOE:
Whoo!

01:08.869 --> 01:10.671
WADE:
Well, hey there.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.441
Notice how whenever I come
around, there's always sparks?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.676
If you like that, wait
till you see my Taser.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.812
Listen, you want me to help
you fix the fuse box or not?

01:18.812 --> 01:21.449
The fuse keeps blowing
because of your new amp,

01:21.449 --> 01:24.685
so, no, I do not want
or need your help.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.154
you're overloading it
with all your girl stuff.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.955
Yeah, that's me,

01:27.955 --> 01:30.824
with my girly Wi-Fi connection
and my silly cell phone

01:30.824 --> 01:34.228
that I only use to look
at pictures of ponies.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.464
I have alienated most of
the people in this town.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.266
More like all of 'em.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.433
So the Internet
and the phone

01:39.433 --> 01:42.703
are my only contact
with humanity.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.873
Okay, I'm gonna get
a bucket of lake water,

01:45.873 --> 01:48.576
so when you catch on fire,
it doesn't spread my way.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.383
* *

02:14.935 --> 02:16.637
Hey.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.940
You're the one who ruined
our parade, aren't you?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.875
Yeah, that was me.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.244
Thanks for remembering.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.749
Hi.
Oh, good morning,
Shelley.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.850
I'm in the mood

02:29.850 --> 02:31.219
for an egg-white Greek omelet

02:31.219 --> 02:32.886
with feta cheese
and kalamata olives.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.256
Get over that mood--
you get fried or scrambled.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.658
Scrambled, be great.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.793
Okay, scrambled to go.
I didn't say to go.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.563
I'm just thinking
about your safety.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.403
Hello there,
Dr. Hart.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.206
Hey, are you sure you want to be
seen talking to me?

02:52.206 --> 02:55.809
Um... yeah, I'll
take my chances.

02:55.809 --> 02:56.977
What's with the suit?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.512
You have a funeral to get to?

02:58.512 --> 03:01.014
No, I'm just taking some
depositions up to Mobile,

03:01.014 --> 03:02.916
but I just wanted
to warn you,

03:02.916 --> 03:06.053
that I think someone, as a joke,
signed you up

03:06.053 --> 03:08.989
Did it occur to you that
I may have signed up myself?

03:08.989 --> 03:11.259
No, it did not.
Because I did.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.226
You did?
I love to cook.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.627
I cook like crazy.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.496
Cook all the time,
watch the cooking shows

03:15.496 --> 03:17.498
on the Cooking Show Channel.
Do you?

03:17.498 --> 03:20.868
I don't think
I get that channel.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.338
'cause it is an excellent venue
for shows about cooking,

03:24.338 --> 03:25.973
which I love to do.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.842
Okay, then.

03:28.842 --> 03:33.146
that Brick Breeland pretty
much always wins our cook-off.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.915
So I have heard,
but I don't care.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.385
Face it, I haven't
started off well

03:37.385 --> 03:40.554
in BlueBell,
with sabotaging the parade,

03:40.554 --> 03:43.023
making an archenemy
of your fiancée...

03:43.023 --> 03:44.292
Misdiagnosing a tick bite.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.693
I'm glad you are keeping track,

03:45.693 --> 03:47.961
but you know more
than anyone, I need

03:47.961 --> 03:50.831
30% of the patients
to keep my part of the practice.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.200
Yeah, and gumbo
is gonna do that how?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.035
but apparently
the people of BlueBell

03:55.035 --> 03:56.770
are quick to distrust strangers.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.607
I need to prove to this town
that I belong here.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.109
And what better way
than participating

04:02.109 --> 04:04.312
If I beat Brick Breeland
while I'm at it,

04:04.312 --> 04:07.080
well, that would just be
the cherry on...

04:07.080 --> 04:09.016
the gumbo.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.219
Well, okay.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.987
LEMON:
 All right, Annabeth,

04:13.987 --> 04:17.124
now what is it that you want
to tell us about that Dr. Hart?

04:17.124 --> 04:20.394
Well, I heard from my cousin
Rhonda's boyfriend Lane,

04:20.394 --> 04:22.663
who's, like, best friends
with the kid Zander

04:22.663 --> 04:25.666
Oh, my goodness, Annabeth,
I can feel myself aging.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.734
Sorry.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.201
The lawn boy says
sometimes

04:28.201 --> 04:30.103
Zoe Hart has breakfast
with the mayor.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.940
In his home?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.174
Mm-hmm.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.344
Is your lawn
boy suggesting

04:36.344 --> 04:37.911
that they are
sleeping together?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.613
What?
Oh, Lord, no.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.515
She comes in from
the carriage house to eat.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.117
First thing, wakes up
and walks right over.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.321
Of course she does, silly,
that's where the food is.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.656
Now, if they're not
sleeping together,

04:48.656 --> 04:50.358
what was the point
of your epic tale?

04:50.358 --> 04:53.361
She parades around
in front of the mayor

04:53.361 --> 04:55.863
without a stitch of makeup.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.632
(laughs)
Well, obviously
that girl...

05:03.771 --> 05:06.974
Continue your
reconnaissance, Annabeth.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.942
That girl is a walking...

05:08.942 --> 05:10.110
(chuckles)

05:10.110 --> 05:11.979
Hello.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.316
A walking menace.

05:18.719 --> 05:22.155
Name, insurance carrier, and Dr.
Breeland will be right with you.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.357
Actually, I'm a doctor.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.958
I work here.

05:24.958 --> 05:29.129
Who are you?
Didi-- your new receptionist?

05:29.129 --> 05:32.800
Dr. Breeland never mentioned
anything about another doctor.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.368
It's not that
strange, really.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.837
BRICK:
Folks, I'm sorry,
you can wait

05:36.837 --> 05:41.509
but Doris Culp thinks Albert
is having a heart attack again.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.811
she's just trying to handicap
my gumbo-making,

05:43.811 --> 05:47.915
but little does she know
that I put my pot on last night.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.584
How could you hire
a new receptionist

05:50.584 --> 05:52.019
without consulting me?
We share this practice,

05:52.019 --> 05:53.153
50-50.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.822
Except all the
patients are mine,

05:54.822 --> 05:56.557
but, you know, if
you want to choose

05:56.557 --> 06:00.027
the kind of lollipops we
hand out, that's all yours.

06:03.431 --> 06:06.734
I vote for lime
or cherry, not grape.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.201
LAVON:
Oh, you're back
in here again.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.169
Hi.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.471
I'm so sorry,

06:10.471 --> 06:12.440
but Dr. Breeland
just stepped out.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.974
What-- excuse me,

06:13.974 --> 06:15.743
how do you know he's here
to see Brick and not

06:15.743 --> 06:16.710
here to see me?
I will ask,

06:16.710 --> 06:17.711
but I don't want you

06:17.711 --> 06:18.846
to get your hopes up.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.548
I was in the
neighborhood, thought

06:20.548 --> 06:22.049
I'd look in
on Dr. Hart.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.717
How you doing?
Hey.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.586
(chuckles)
I'm, I'm Lavon Hayes.

06:25.586 --> 06:29.322
I don't believe we've met.
Hi,

06:29.322 --> 06:31.425
Just moved out from Georgia
about a month ago.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.727
Oh, well, please
allow the mayor

06:33.727 --> 06:36.329
of our fair town
to welcome you.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.833
The mayor?! W-Wow, w...

06:39.833 --> 06:41.435
Look at me, getting
all flustered

06:41.435 --> 06:44.037
around famous people.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.939
He had to leave.
Can I help you?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.374
Are you a doctor?

06:47.374 --> 06:48.809
I know, right?

06:48.809 --> 06:50.343
Weird.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.612
My son was bitten by a snake.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.613
Okay, no problem,

06:52.613 --> 06:53.947
let's check it out.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.884
MOTHER:
 He had a sleepover

06:56.884 --> 06:58.085
at his friend's,
and they went

06:58.085 --> 06:59.720
to explore
inside the old Hooper house,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.322
where I have told him
a million times not to play.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.057
Right, and there was a snake?
Well, he didn't see it,

07:04.057 --> 07:06.460
but he stepped into a hole
in the floor and it bit him,

07:06.460 --> 07:08.462
which is why we don't play
in that house.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.497
No cyanosis,

07:09.497 --> 07:11.131
minor swelling, and no fever.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.132
(sighs)

07:12.132 --> 07:13.834
So it wasn't poisonous?

07:13.834 --> 07:15.669
Probably.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.606
Probably it was
or probably it wasn't?

07:18.606 --> 07:22.309
I'm gonna go get him
an antihistamine.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.145
Excuse me.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.948
Sorry, I need to check
something online.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.218
(typing)

07:31.218 --> 07:34.988
So is that Lavon guy single?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.324
Huh?

07:37.324 --> 07:40.894
He seems really nice and cute,
but, I mean, he's the mayor,

07:40.894 --> 07:44.464
so I'm sure he's got tons
and tons of girls swooning...

07:44.464 --> 07:48.135
you need to determine the kind
of snake that made the bite.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.270
Crap.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.273
Did you just Ask Jeeves
how to cure a snakebite?

07:53.273 --> 07:55.442
Here you go.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.877
So, luckily, the
reaction is local,

07:56.877 --> 07:59.880
so the chance of
envenomation is small,

07:59.880 --> 08:02.082
exactly what kind of snake
we're dealing with,

08:02.082 --> 08:04.117
so I'm just going to do
some quick research.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.118
You sit tight.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.119
I'll take that.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.026
WADE:
 First the fuse box.
 You don't have a car.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.028
Admit it, Doc...

08:17.164 --> 08:19.567
You need my help.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.103
Technically,
I did not need your help.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.073
I finally get my first patient
and it's a freaking snakebite.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.675
I simply needed you
to take me to the snake.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.043
You are my ride,
not my help.

08:30.043 --> 08:30.844
Very different.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.445
Okay, well, you
got your ride.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.014
But...

08:34.881 --> 08:36.482
But there's
a snake in there.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.451
Probably a few.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.587
Aren't you going
to come in, too?

08:40.587 --> 08:43.190
No, I'm just the driver.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.596
Say "please," Doc.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.298
Please.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.936
Here, snakey-snakey-snakey.

08:59.940 --> 09:04.111
Ah, the old Hooper house.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.413
I used to bring my
high school girlfriends here.

09:06.413 --> 09:10.884
Please tell me they were
still breathing at the time.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.920
There's no need
to look up.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.824
Poisonous ones don't climb--
well, cottonmouths sometimes,

09:16.824 --> 09:21.028
but none in these parts...
usually.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.130
What do you
mean, usually?

09:23.130 --> 09:26.266
No, what we're
looking for is a...

09:26.266 --> 09:29.569
a rattler
or a copperhead.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.973
It's a real, real pretty tan
thing with brown blotches.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.113
Oh, my God.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.983
What?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.752
Ho!

09:44.752 --> 09:45.986
(screams)
(laughs)

09:45.986 --> 09:46.787
Wade.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.256
Oh, it's a rope.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.124
Okay? You are so city.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.126
Copperhead.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.127
What?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.996
Copperhead.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.799
Wow, that
was quick.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.634
Lucky we found it.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.535
Not really.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.705
Oh.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.846
(squawking)

10:20.120 --> 10:21.021
This is so stupid.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.823
You don't need
to carry me.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.493
First rule of a
snakebite, Doc--

10:26.493 --> 10:29.362
What's the second rule-- apply
pressure to side of boob?

10:29.362 --> 10:31.231
Hmm.
Put me down.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.069
Well, glad I
could be of help.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.172
DIDI: Oh, no, hon,
what happened?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.308
I found the snake
and vice versa.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.343
Oh, my Lord, thank
God for Dr. Breeland.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.278
He knew
exactly

10:45.278 --> 10:47.915
what kind of snake bit my son--
a copperhead--

10:47.915 --> 10:50.283
without going anywhere,
and he could tell

10:50.283 --> 10:53.320
how much venom was in there
without going anywhere.

10:53.320 --> 10:57.725
Yeah, well, I got proof
firsthand. And...

10:59.259 --> 11:00.560
You poor thing.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.295
Let's get you in
to see the doctor.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.630
I am the doctor.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.465
The other doctor.
Come on, come on.

11:05.465 --> 11:09.102
Maybe if you wore
a stethoscope or something.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.340
Well, you should have
just called me.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.509
I've seen about a thousand
copperhead bites in my career.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.012
Well, unfortunately,
by the time

11:19.012 --> 11:21.348
my people settled onto the
island of Manhattan,

11:21.348 --> 11:23.216
the copperhead population
had dwindled a bit.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.618
Well, I think we can agree
that after this,

11:25.618 --> 11:28.722
between the two of us,
one of us belongs in this town.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.858
The other does not.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.329
ZOE:
 Can you believe he said that?

11:36.329 --> 11:39.066
Well, it's going to make it
all the more delicious

11:39.066 --> 11:41.268
when I destroy him in
the gumbo contest.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.070
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.773
I'm looking for
the wrong thing.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.440
You want the magic
gumbo pot.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.977
Oh, hey,

11:49.977 --> 11:51.879
I forgot to tell you--

11:51.879 --> 11:53.781
our new receptionist Didi
asked about you.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.348
She did?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.717
Uh-huh. She thinks
you're cute. Ask her out.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.053
Yeah, um...

12:00.053 --> 12:01.822
There's something--

12:01.822 --> 12:04.324
someone-- I'm still kind
of trying to get over.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.793
Thanks, though.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.361
Mm, here it is.
I knew I had one.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.831
Banged on it once
to scare off a possum.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.265
Perfect.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.535
Doesn't come with the gumbo
already in it, you know.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.772
(chuckles)

12:18.772 --> 12:21.341
I hope you know gumbo
takes a while to prepare.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.645
You see, the word "prepare"
can be interpreted in many ways.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.215
that Emeril Lagasse is
one of my mother's clients,

12:28.215 --> 12:30.884
and he agreed to overnight me
a vat of his best gumbo.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.854
I am "prepared"
for it to arrive,
at which point

12:33.854 --> 12:35.823
I will "prepare"
to put it into this pot.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.125
I did not hear any of that,
you understand?

12:38.125 --> 12:42.129
I am the mayor of this town,
sworn to uphold the laws,

12:42.129 --> 12:45.565
and the traditions, and the
integrity of the gumbo festival.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.401
I just want to beat Brick.
Just let me win, come on.

12:48.401 --> 12:52.705
Hey, Doc, I, uh, found this
package, or what's left of it,

12:52.705 --> 12:54.908
on your stoop.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.343
Ba-blouw.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.777
(gasps)

12:57.777 --> 12:59.312
It's my gumbo!

12:59.312 --> 13:00.547
Look at this.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.316
I'm going to sue that stupid
overnight carrier.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.854
Well, you might have to sue
the mayor's alligator.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.155
I saw him

13:08.155 --> 13:09.789
slithering away
one happy reptile.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.926
Burt Reynolds ate my gumbo!

13:12.926 --> 13:16.729
Besides, keeps me from
having to disqualify you.

13:16.729 --> 13:20.700
Hey, listen, my Uncle Mo's got
a pretty kick-ass gumbo recipe.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.136
If you want my help, I'm...
I don't need
your help, Wade.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.039
Okay? Last time I had your help,
I also got this.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.310
What are you going
to do now?
I have no choice.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.014
I'll have Emeril
e-mail me his recipe

13:34.014 --> 13:35.282
and I'll make
my own gumbo.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.184
Do you even know
how to cook?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.952
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

13:38.952 --> 13:42.489
Uh, because we don't
think you can cook.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.591
I'm going to
figure it out, okay?

13:44.591 --> 13:49.596
Come hell or high water,
I'm going to become a
respected part of this...

13:49.596 --> 13:52.765
extremely charming community.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.402
(doorknob rattling)

13:55.402 --> 13:58.638
LEMON: How was your breakfast
 this morning

13:58.638 --> 14:00.173
at the Rammer Jammer?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.309
Same as it is most days.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.745
Had the fruit plate.
Mm-hmm.

14:05.745 --> 14:09.282
Lemon, if you would like to ask
me if I ran into Zoe Hart,

14:09.282 --> 14:11.351
well, I can't take
the suspense.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.752
You've got eyes
all over this town.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.254
You know very well I did.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.924
Well, why is all
I want to know.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.259
I mean, why would you
be treating a woman

14:19.259 --> 14:21.361
who is so obviously
out to destroy me

14:21.361 --> 14:23.330
with such
unapologetic kindness?

14:23.330 --> 14:26.967
Well, we're supposed to treat
everyone kindly, sweetheart.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.137
Mm-hmm, there's also something
in there about being loyal

14:30.137 --> 14:32.872
to your fiancée against
her sworn enemies.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.042
That's Deuteronomy,
right, that one?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.945
What would you have me do,
avoid all contact?

14:39.846 --> 14:41.748
You can't be serious.
Why?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.516
Do you want contact with her?

14:43.516 --> 14:46.619
No, I have no interest in
Zoe Hart, but I also don't...

14:46.619 --> 14:48.388
Well, see, there's no
problem then, is there?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.756
Yay, we agree!
You don't talk to her,

14:49.756 --> 14:52.125
and then everyone sees that
we are on the same team.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.230
Have a good day, sweetheart.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.569
(sighs)

15:07.607 --> 15:10.043
Hey.

15:11.011 --> 15:15.048
Well, hey yourself,
Mr. Mayor.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.585
Good to see you.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.001
The recipe says that the
shrimp can't have veins.

15:34.001 --> 15:37.637
Ma'am, I don't know what kind
of shrimp you got in New York,

15:37.637 --> 15:41.441
Now, you want 'em de-veined,
you're gonna have to
do that yourself.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.310
You can use our
butcher block out back.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.012
I don't know how
to de-vein a shrimp.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.314
You're the new doctor, right?

15:47.314 --> 15:50.050
Just pretend like
you're doing surgery

15:50.050 --> 15:52.519
on a little teeny-tiny
shrimpy patient.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.660
ZOE:
I hate damn shrimp!

16:03.063 --> 16:04.597
Come on, shrimp...

16:05.765 --> 16:07.400
Having problems?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.536
I'm so sorry I wasted
my time in medical school

16:09.536 --> 16:12.072
when all I needed was a simple
course in Cajun cooking.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.775
And now the cook-off
is tomorrow,

16:15.775 --> 16:19.346
And now I'm cutting the veins
out of shrimp with one hand,
and they're slippery

16:19.346 --> 16:22.949
and they're slimy,
and hasn't this
town ever heard

16:22.949 --> 16:25.218
What I got out
of that mishmash
is that you're

16:25.218 --> 16:27.687
having problems
with your gumbo.
My gumbo?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.622
Yeah.
Try everything.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.791
Whatever I do down here
reflects on the memory

16:31.791 --> 16:34.794
of Harley Wilkes,
and I have got to
make the people believe

16:34.794 --> 16:37.364
that I am worthy
of following in
his footsteps.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.733
So it may sound silly,
but it seems that

16:40.733 --> 16:44.571
the only way to make that happen
is by winning this cook-off.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.309
Put down the knife.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.313
And back away from the shrimp.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.650
You're coming with me, okay?
I've got an idea.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.752
Good, 'cause I'm losing my mind.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.388
Come on.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.765
ZOE: Stop. You're making me
hungry for New York.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.568
You know what
I really love?

17:15.568 --> 17:18.438
The buttercup cod
at Bond Street.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.607
I used to dream about that.
Oh, yeah?

17:20.607 --> 17:24.010
Yes.
No, no, no, my favorite sushi is
at Jewel Bako on 5th Street.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.112
Never had it.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.878
No?
No.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.116
All right, favorite dish...

17:29.116 --> 17:32.585
Mine is the sweet corn...

17:32.585 --> 17:34.421
The risotto at Per Se!
Per Se.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.822
Yeah.
That's my favorite, too.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.124
It's so good.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.426
I used to go on my nights
off from the hospital.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.528
Wow. Yeah, my-my office was
right around the corner.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.664
I used to take clients
all the time.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.033
I wonder if we were ever
there at the same time.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.102
Though I'd probably
remember that.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.173
All right, Zoe Hart, well...
Hmm, what?

17:53.173 --> 17:55.175
you may be an expert
at New York cuisine.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.609
Mm-hm?
But I know gumbo.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.279
And the secret to a good gumbo
is the base.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.880
You got to use
fresh tomatoes,
like this one.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.082
Is this not the most
incredible tomato
you've ever seen

18:03.082 --> 18:05.051
in your life?
Worth the drive alone.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.520
Yeah, nothing like
all other tomatoes.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.323
(laughing)

18:10.323 --> 18:14.127
So, how is the wedding
planning coming?

18:14.127 --> 18:17.096
Oh, well, it's,
uh, fairly insane.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.098
Tastings, florists.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.334
Lemon wants it to be
the event of the season.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.470
And by season,
she means millennium.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.805
Lemon just
wants the best

18:25.805 --> 18:27.740
for everything, I guess.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.376
Well, then you should
definitely get her

18:29.376 --> 18:31.611
some of those world
famous tomatoes, too.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.813
Yeah, I don't think
she needs any.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.683
Oh, my God.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.185
What?

18:38.185 --> 18:39.652
That's the reason why we drove

18:39.652 --> 18:42.355
out to the middle of nowhere
to this farm stand.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.790
Lemon doesn't know
you're with me.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.693
Well, you're not exactly
one of her favorite people.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.162
Yeah.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.166
She asked me not
to talk to you.

18:53.166 --> 18:57.103
Of course she did. I'm the
lunatic that ruined her parade.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.939
Stay away from crazy
Zoe and her witchy,

18:59.939 --> 19:01.774
Blue State black magic!

19:01.774 --> 19:04.811
I didn't think that you'd
believe that, too.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.990
Just "Hey."
That was it,
just... just "Hey"?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.626
Just "Hey."

19:19.626 --> 19:22.829
Then I might've said, uh...
"Nice to see you."

19:22.829 --> 19:23.996
Whoa.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.732
I know.

19:25.732 --> 19:29.269
Well, I thought you said
you laid on the charm
when you first saw her.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.038
That was before I knew
she was into me. I froze.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.907
I had no idea

19:34.907 --> 19:36.709
How you normally start
things. Go back to that.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.279
Lavon Hayes was
a pro football player.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.113
People started things for me.

19:41.113 --> 19:44.016
Look, you just...
You're a little out
of shape is all, champ.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.319
Practice.
Practice?

19:46.319 --> 19:49.489
You can't go into
a game all cold.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.158
Act like I'm... Wait,
what's her name again?
Didi.

19:52.158 --> 19:55.362
Then I'm Didi.
I wish I had my gun.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.863
Is it D-I-D-I
or D-double-E, D-double-E,

19:56.863 --> 19:58.865
'cause I've seen it
spelled both ways.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.401
Why is that important?
I'm just trying to
understand my character.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.337
All right,
go ahead, I'm her.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.177
Hey,

20:11.177 --> 20:13.145
Didi.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.615
(feminine voice):
Well, hey there.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.183
Don't you just look fine.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.217
Oh, dear God.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.952
Why would
you say that?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.621
I... I mean...

20:21.621 --> 20:24.591
You know, 'cause she thinks
you're hot or something.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.793
Yeah, but she wouldn't
say it first thing.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.094
Girls do to me.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.797
Well, we're not pretending
like it's you.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.700
Hey, dude, I'm... I'm trying
to help you out here.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.436
You're really bad at this.
Okay, fine. You know what?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.705
I'm calling an audible.
Whole new plan.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.973
Ignore her.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.910
Freeze her out.
I know for a fact
chicks dig that.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.478
Really?

20:45.478 --> 20:46.713
Okay, I have to put

20:46.713 --> 20:49.882
a stop to this.
Asking Wade how to woo women

20:49.882 --> 20:52.685
is like asking a hunter
how to train bears.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.487
A woman wants

20:54.487 --> 20:57.824
a romantic gesture.
Do that.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.461
I don't know.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.829
Could be a trick.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.635
I should have asked
for another paper bag.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.971
So I could cover my head and you
could sneak me into your car.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.806
You're funny.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.475
Someone call 911!

21:15.475 --> 21:17.677
I'm a doctor. What is it?

21:17.677 --> 21:20.179
The farmer's been
in an accident.

21:20.179 --> 21:24.016
I'm going to go help out.
Just go. I'll find a way home.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.487
MAN:
He was trying to fix it,

21:27.487 --> 21:29.456
and it just... the thing
collapsed on him.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.292
Pulse is weak.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.695
Okay, let's get it off him.
Come on.

21:35.695 --> 21:40.266
Wait, stop. This part is
gouging into a major artery.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.102
It's stopping the blood flow.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.038
Well, we can't just leave
him under there. We got to
get him to the hospital.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.974
Yeah, but the hospital's
30 minutes away.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.410
All right, go out to the road,
wait for the ambulance.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.778
Direct it back here, okay?
All right.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.180
Give me your tie.
Yeah, of course.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.948
Even when the ambulance gets
here, it's still going

21:55.948 --> 21:58.150
to take 30 minutes to get
him back to the hospital.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.419
He won't make it.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.355
We have to stop the bleeding.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.592
Oh, God, I only
have one hand.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.927
I can't do this
by myself.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.562
We have no choice.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.164
We have to call Brick.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.467
I know.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.503
I'll call him.

22:18.938 --> 22:23.209
DIDI: Okay, I've paged Dr.
Breeland. Good luck, George.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.312
My goodness,
what lovely flowers.

22:26.312 --> 22:27.547
Hello there.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.782
You must be Didi.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.718
It's a pretty name.
I'm Dr. Breeland's daughter.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.753
When Daddy told me that he hired
a new receptionist,

22:33.753 --> 22:35.655
I said, "Lemon,
you have just got to bring

22:35.655 --> 22:38.157
that girl a covered dish."
That is so
sweet of you.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.492
Well, I ought to feel

22:39.492 --> 22:40.993
welcome by now.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.496
A casserole from you,
flowers from the mayor.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.867
Mayor?

22:47.867 --> 22:51.604
Why, yes, I-I know
who our mayor is, dear.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.606
That is just so thoughtful
of him.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.742
He is quite the public servant,
isn't he?

22:55.742 --> 22:56.976
Oh, my gosh, he is so nice.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.178
I was just about to call
him and thank him.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.880
You know what, I would wait.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.582
Because men,
they enjoy the chase.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.183
You might be right.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.885
Hey, listen, Didi,
you know what?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.720
There don't seem to be
any more patients waiting.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.722
Why don't you close up
early and you and I go out

23:09.722 --> 23:11.924
for a drink, get
to know each other better.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.693
Really?
Yeah.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.894
Wow.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.096
That would be great.
I-I would just love that.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.332
Okay, okay, here I am.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.101
As are the two of you.

23:25.572 --> 23:29.075
Oscar, it's Dr. Breeland.
Can you hear me?
You know him?

23:29.075 --> 23:31.511
Of course I do. Have you
talked to his wife?

23:31.511 --> 23:32.779
There wasn't time.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.414
We've been busy putting
on his tourniquet

23:35.414 --> 23:37.650
I'm guessing he's lost
over 500 CCs of blood.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.652
The only reason he
hasn't bled to death

23:39.652 --> 23:42.388
is because this thing is
acting as an arterial clamp.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.256
Yeah, and if they
lift it, he will die.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.425
Right. Our only hope is
to do an arterial cut-down

23:46.425 --> 23:49.328
above the point of impact,
but I only have one hand, so...

23:49.328 --> 23:52.799
An arterial cut-down?
Look, I've done
a lot of them, Brick.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.802
I can talk you through it.
Oh, you want me
to be your puppet?

23:55.802 --> 23:58.505
I want us to save his life.

24:13.252 --> 24:17.857
eight centimeters distal
to the antecubital fossa--
using an 11-blade scalpel.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.626
Yeah.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.632
All right.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.702
I have made the incision.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.103
Now, I need you
to use your fingers

24:31.103 --> 24:33.105
to push until you palpate
the radial artery.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.575
The radial artery is
connected to the thumb.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.943
I know where the
radial artery is.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.678
I did go to
medical school, too.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.780
Fine. Just let me know
when it's isolated.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.016
Yeah, I got it.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.552
Now remember--
the radial nerve

24:45.552 --> 24:46.986
is immediately lateral
to the radial artery.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.689
You need to maneuver around it.

24:49.689 --> 24:54.961
Again, I know.
Now with one hand I need you
to push aside the muscle,

24:54.961 --> 24:57.630
and with the other,
I need you to clamp the artery.

25:04.470 --> 25:05.872
(Oscar groans)

25:05.872 --> 25:07.406
He's waking up.
No, he can't move.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.241
He'll rip the artery.
No, no, you
can't move now.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.410
I'm doing this as quick
as I can, Oscar.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.380
Look, I know it hurts,
I know it hurts,

25:14.380 --> 25:17.116
Just think of Patty and Tyler
and just think of little Maggie.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.785
Come on, can you
do this for them?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.953
That's it,
that's it.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.322
That's it.
(groaning stops)

25:23.322 --> 25:25.658
Good job, Brick.
Yeah.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.229
All right, apply the clamp.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.274
Yeah, it's clamped.

25:42.274 --> 25:45.311
Now you need to slowly bring
the systolic down to test it.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.337
Oh, thank the Lord.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.538
He's not bleeding out.

26:12.538 --> 26:16.342
(relieved sighs)

26:16.342 --> 26:19.145
All right. All right,
let's get him out of here.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.215
Hang in there, Oscar.
Come on now.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.217
(siren grows louder)

26:27.419 --> 26:29.656
Hey.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.162
I don't get it.

26:36.162 --> 26:39.365
You send someone flowers and
they're supposed to call

26:39.365 --> 26:40.700
and-and say thank you.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.569
Maybe she's allergic
to flowers, you know.

26:43.569 --> 26:48.540
Maybe her face
is all... (yells)

26:48.540 --> 26:52.679
Zoe said Didi likes me.
So why don't she call?

26:52.679 --> 26:53.713
Hey, Bridget Jones,

26:53.713 --> 26:55.247
why don't you
quit whining,

26:55.247 --> 26:56.783
beer up, come sit down

26:56.783 --> 26:59.719
so I can whip your ass
in this game real fast.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.253
Thank you.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.792
You're right.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.993
You're right.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.828
Screw it.
Thank you.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.764
If she want to pass up
a shot at Lavon Hayes...

27:11.764 --> 27:13.599
Lavon Hayes!
I'm sayin'.

27:13.599 --> 27:14.834
It's her loss.
Right?

27:14.834 --> 27:16.202
Dirt off your shoulder, man.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.770
Yeah.
(chuckles)
Let's do this.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.205
(explosion on television)

27:20.773 --> 27:25.011
Hey, could we lower
the volume a bit?

27:25.011 --> 27:27.079
In case, you know,
the phone rings.

27:29.515 --> 27:32.952
Do you want to settle
down in BlueBell?
Permanently?

27:32.952 --> 27:35.554
It's a real beautiful town,
and everyone seems real sweet.

27:35.554 --> 27:37.423
Starting with the mayor.
He is...

27:37.423 --> 27:38.858
So nice.
...so nice.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.860
Yes, we covered
this already.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.295
So tell me, Didi,
what do you want to do?

27:43.295 --> 27:45.765
I mean, I can't imagine
a bright girl like you

27:45.765 --> 27:47.366
would want to be a
receptionist forever.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.136
Oh, no, no. Obviously,
this isn't my dream job,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.338
and it doesn't
pay very well.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.874
But Dr. Breeland said I was
definitely gonna get a raise.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.409
(laughing)
Daddy!

27:57.409 --> 27:58.745
Oh, my goodness.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.279
You know what, honey,
let me tell you,

28:00.279 --> 28:02.381
since we are talking
about nice men,

28:02.381 --> 28:03.750
my daddy is the nicest man,

28:03.750 --> 28:05.852
but when he says that
he will pay you more,

28:05.852 --> 28:08.487
he means more compliments
and that is about it.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.622
Oh, oh.

28:10.622 --> 28:14.026
You know what?
I think I know a way

28:14.026 --> 28:16.228
where you can make
twice as much money.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.964
Really?
Yes, we are
Alabama women.

28:17.964 --> 28:21.233
We need to help each
other whenever we can.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.935
Wow.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.341
You were-- you were so focused
and in control in there.

28:29.341 --> 28:32.044
That was-- whew, it was--
that was impressive.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.246
But that was surgery. I've
trained for it my whole life.

28:34.246 --> 28:37.549
I've just never done it via
proxy, or ankle deep in manure.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.685
I'm going to get you to the
hospital real quick now, Oscar.

28:39.685 --> 28:42.254
Don't you worry about Patty.
I'm going to stop by the house,

28:42.254 --> 28:44.991
I'm going to tell her
you are going to be fine.
Thank you.

28:44.991 --> 28:47.359
Where's the doctor
who saved you?

28:47.359 --> 28:49.495
OSCAR:
There he is.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.097
Dr. Breeland.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.500
Nice job, sir.
You performed a miracle.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.735
BRICK:
I did what I had to do.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.205
And you...

29:00.339 --> 29:02.909
...might want to be
getting home now, George.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.211
It's getting late.

29:14.787 --> 29:15.988
I had to stand there and watch

29:15.988 --> 29:17.356
while he took
all the credit for it.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.791
That sucks.
Oh, that's not salt.

29:18.791 --> 29:22.394
That's cleanser.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.931
You're not the only one
saving lives around here.

29:24.931 --> 29:28.534
I've been up all night
cooking this stuff.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.970
What did I do to make
Brick hate me so much?

29:30.970 --> 29:32.171
It's not you, sweetheart,
it's him.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.673
He's an arrogant
son of a bitch.

29:34.673 --> 29:37.443
One thing I can bet those
little shorts of yours on,

29:37.443 --> 29:42.514
the entire town's gonna
think he's a hero by now.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.617
You know what, screw George.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.486
George?
I'm gonna set
everyone straight.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.488
I'm going to march
into that cook-off

29:49.488 --> 29:52.358
and I am going to tell everyone
what a phony Brick Breeland is.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.793
No, you're not.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.296
that you're one of them, you're
going to go to the cook-off,

29:57.296 --> 29:59.331
put your game face on,
suck it up

29:59.331 --> 30:02.501
and mix in with the community,
hmm?

30:03.502 --> 30:06.505
Fine. You're right.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.841
Maybe I could still win
the gumbo contest.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.910
Will you try it?

30:17.884 --> 30:19.818
A moral victory's good, too.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.321
(Wade laughing)
Aw.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.124
Oh, man!

30:25.124 --> 30:26.392
Do you have a
garbage disposal?

30:26.392 --> 30:29.495
Wait, wait, no. Hang on.
Shame to waste...

30:32.965 --> 30:34.466
Burt Reynolds!

30:34.466 --> 30:36.468
Breakfast time!

30:36.468 --> 30:39.571
* *

30:54.653 --> 30:58.891
I heard he did the entire
procedure lying on the ground.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.359
On his stomach.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.029
And then got home in time
to make his gumbo

31:03.029 --> 31:06.098
even more scrumptious
than last year.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.171
Daddy, I'm just so proud
of you, I could burst.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.306
How about a good, tall glass of
lemonade for the town hero?

31:14.306 --> 31:17.376
All right, now no more
of that hero talk from
you, Lemon Meringue,

31:17.376 --> 31:19.745
but a nice cold
drink sounds good.
George?

31:19.745 --> 31:21.948
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

31:23.916 --> 31:28.587
So you are really going to
let all these people think
it was all your doing, huh?

31:28.587 --> 31:30.789
Well, you gonna contradict me?

31:30.789 --> 31:34.560
You see, then you'd have to
explain what you were doing
outside of town, all alone

31:34.560 --> 31:37.596
with that woman...
Brick, you know damn well
nothing was going on.

31:37.596 --> 31:42.368
Why, you and I may believe
that, but I'm not so sure
that my daughter will.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.210
MAN:
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor.
Yes, yes.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.945
Did you hear the news?
No.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.180
You know, Brick saved

31:54.180 --> 31:56.182
that man's arm,
and his life.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.450
The next town hall meeting,
we've got to take a vote

31:58.450 --> 31:59.918
on having a Brick Breeland Day,
right?

31:59.918 --> 32:01.420
I will consider that.
All right, now.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.654
Thank you.

32:02.654 --> 32:06.858
Moral victories bite.
I'm getting a drink.

32:06.858 --> 32:10.696
Mr. Mayor, I just want to
say thank you so much for
the beautiful flowers.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.098
Flowers?

32:12.098 --> 32:14.200
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I did send flowers.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.235
I'm glad you like 'em.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.938
Well, okay.
Thanks again.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.542
Bye.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.513
Uh, Didi, uh, would you like
to go out to dinner sometime?

32:27.513 --> 32:28.947
With me, I mean.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.184
Oh, gosh, um...

32:32.184 --> 32:34.553
Wow. Uh, I'm sorry.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.355
I'm moving to Montgomery
in a couple days.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.324
I'm sorry, you're moving?

32:38.324 --> 32:40.326
Yeah. I got a job
at a law firm up there

32:40.326 --> 32:41.860
and the salary's way more

32:41.860 --> 32:43.229
than I'm making now.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.364
I still got a lot
of school loans to pay.

32:45.364 --> 32:48.000
So, um... I'm sorry.
I like you,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.203
but there's no point in getting
involved if I'm not staying.

32:51.203 --> 32:54.006
Right, no. Yeah, I get it.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.308
Good for you, yeah.
And good luck to you.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.610
Oh, there's Lemon.
I have to go thank her.

32:58.610 --> 33:02.781
She called in a favor and got me
the job. How nice is that?

33:02.781 --> 33:06.585
Are you not telling the
truth to protect George Tucker

33:06.585 --> 33:08.920
for some reason? 'Cause if you
were, that'd be real stupid.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.258
For the 400th time, I do not
need your advice, your help,

33:12.258 --> 33:13.259
or your Alabama lovin'.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.627
Get me another water, okay?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.463
Yup.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.665
I'll have another
lemonade, son.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.433
You got it.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.703
Hope you're not boozing.

33:24.703 --> 33:28.174
You've got office hours
this afternoon.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.341
Course, seeing
as you don't have

33:29.341 --> 33:30.909
any patients, what
the hell? Drink up!

33:30.909 --> 33:33.145
I know my responsibilities.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.847
Oh?
Brick, I just spoke
to a guy down at WBMA.

33:35.847 --> 33:39.751
He said the radio station wants
to do a story about you

33:39.751 --> 33:40.952
for saving
Oscar Balderrama.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.855
Well, that
sounds good, Tom.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.524
How dare you!
Excuse me?

33:45.524 --> 33:50.096
How can you stand there and take
credit for something that I did?

33:50.096 --> 33:53.665
If you would have
been there alone yesterday,

33:53.665 --> 33:57.736
You know damn well that I was
the brains behind the procedure.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.706
Dr. Brick Breeland is
no one's assistant.

34:00.706 --> 34:04.443
Most certainly not some
arrogant New York newbie.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.479
I may be a newbie,
but I am also a surgeon.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.715
And like it or not,
I was useful yesterday.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.882
You know how much
it would mean to me

34:11.882 --> 34:13.219
to finally prove myself.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.985
You know
that I need patients

34:14.985 --> 34:16.455
to hold onto
my father's practice.

34:16.455 --> 34:19.291
But you are a prideful Southern
man who can't admit

34:19.291 --> 34:21.327
that he had to defer
to a woman!

34:21.327 --> 34:25.731
Ms. Hart,
that is my practice, too.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.266
One that I have worked
a long time for.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.302
One that I deserve
to have all to myself.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.003
And yes, you may have

34:32.003 --> 34:34.172
lead the way on
that cut-down,

34:34.172 --> 34:36.908
but that is not all
that happened out there.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.944
When Oscar was panicking
and pushing that plow off

34:38.944 --> 34:43.449
and about to bleed out,
I am the one who got him calm.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.051
And I am the one who
went to the hospital

34:46.051 --> 34:48.387
and stayed with him.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.989
And I am the one
who went out to that farm

34:50.989 --> 34:52.190
and talked to his wife,

34:52.190 --> 34:55.261
and I promised her
her husband was

34:55.261 --> 34:56.395
gonna be all right,

34:56.395 --> 34:58.164
that his arm was
gonna be all right,

34:58.164 --> 35:00.098
that their farm was
gonna be all right.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.134
I don't recall seeing you
out there.

35:05.437 --> 35:10.509
Yes, I, I admit,
I may be a proud man...

35:10.509 --> 35:14.112
and maybe I did take credit
for a procedure

35:14.112 --> 35:15.547
I didn't wholly do.

35:17.683 --> 35:21.787
But if you can't admit
that I saved Oscar's life

35:21.787 --> 35:23.189
just as much as you did,

35:23.189 --> 35:25.591
then you are just
as prideful as I am.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.534
(cowbell jangles)

35:35.534 --> 35:37.703
DEWITT:
May I have your attention,
please?!

35:37.703 --> 35:40.071
Attention, please?!

35:40.071 --> 35:41.673
It's that time again.

35:41.673 --> 35:47.145
And the winner of
this year's gumbo cook-off--

35:47.145 --> 35:50.882
and still champion--
our local hero,

35:50.882 --> 35:52.751
Dr. Brick Breeland!

35:52.751 --> 35:54.286
(cheering)

35:54.286 --> 35:55.554
Come on
down here.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.224
Brick! Brick!
Speech!!

35:59.758 --> 36:03.329
Well, thank y'all, thank y'all
so much. I really appreciate it.

36:03.329 --> 36:06.298
Um, you know,
as they say in Hollywood,

36:06.298 --> 36:08.434
my gumbo was honored
just to be nominated.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.536
(laughter)
But I gotta
tell ya...

36:10.536 --> 36:14.840
Congratulations. Your gumbo
won second prize.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.108
...if I didn't give a nod
to all my opponents because

36:17.108 --> 36:19.678
it was so good, and I did take
a taste of everybody's gumbo,

36:19.678 --> 36:21.480
and I don't know how
the judges picked a winner...

36:21.480 --> 36:25.284
Oh, my God, I hope that
Daddy doesn't make that
"dumbo" joke again.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.486
(sighs)
You okay, honey?

36:27.486 --> 36:29.855
Lemon, I'm about
to do something

36:29.855 --> 36:32.023
that's gonna make
you really angry.
What?

36:32.023 --> 36:33.392
Just remember
that I love you.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.160
Folks, I must tell you
how-how happy I am...

36:35.160 --> 36:38.397
I'm gonna go up there
and I'm gonna tell the truth

36:38.397 --> 36:39.598
about what
happened yesterday.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.467
And I don't care
if Lemon finds out,

36:41.467 --> 36:43.635
because people need to know
who really saved that farmer.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.171
No, wait. George, don't.
It's not as simple as that.

36:46.171 --> 36:49.140
Brick may have done more
than I realized.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.710
BRICK:
It just goes to prove
what I've always said,

36:51.710 --> 36:53.779
"Any dumbo can make some gumbo!"

36:53.779 --> 36:55.281
(laughter)

36:55.281 --> 36:57.716
But enough of my yapping.
Let's eat!

36:57.716 --> 36:59.851
(cheering)

37:01.353 --> 37:05.090
Folks? Uh, folks,
if I could just add one thing.

37:05.090 --> 37:11.196
I just learned that my gumbo
took second prize... somehow.

37:11.196 --> 37:13.632
And as runner-up,
I would like to offer

37:13.632 --> 37:16.802
my personal congratulations
to Dr. Breeland.

37:16.802 --> 37:20.038
I'm sure your gumbo is
excellent,

37:20.038 --> 37:22.841
and I look forward to learning
the secret of making it,

37:22.841 --> 37:24.443
just as I look forward

37:24.443 --> 37:28.079
to learning from you in
our medical practice.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.181
(applause)

37:30.181 --> 37:31.783
To Brick.

37:35.521 --> 37:36.922
Hey, man,
I need a favor.
Yeah?

37:36.922 --> 37:39.124
Is, is Thelma still planning
to stay with her mom

37:39.124 --> 37:40.292
up in Tuscaloosa?

37:40.292 --> 37:41.660
LEMON:
George?
I think so.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.830
Um, can... can I
just have a minute?

37:44.830 --> 37:47.466
So what on Earth am I supposed
to be so mad at you about?

37:47.466 --> 37:49.535
Uh, well, I was,
I was just gonna,

37:49.535 --> 37:52.438
I was gonna go up there
and I was gonna say how

37:52.438 --> 37:53.905
I just didn't think
it was fair

37:53.905 --> 37:57.275
that the same person won
two years in a row.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.511
That's...

37:59.511 --> 38:01.547
that's not what
I was gonna say.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.715
I didn't go to a meeting
yesterday.

38:03.715 --> 38:08.587
I took Zoe Hart to go get
ingredients for her gumbo.

38:08.587 --> 38:12.791
Wait, but I specifically asked
you not to.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.127
I know.
But Zoe is-is new in town,

38:16.127 --> 38:20.499
she doesn't have any friends,
and, and... Lemon...

38:20.499 --> 38:22.033
I don't like ultimatums.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.769
And I like to be trusted.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.410
You're right. And I do

38:31.410 --> 38:33.078
trust you, sweetheart,

38:33.078 --> 38:35.347
but where Zoe Hart is concerned,

38:35.347 --> 38:38.417
we're just gonna have to...

38:38.417 --> 38:40.452
agree to disagree.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.054
You're such a cute mayor. Mmm!

38:43.054 --> 38:44.956
LAVON:
Thank you.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.159
Hey, I can't believe

38:48.159 --> 38:49.428
that you made my gumbo.

38:49.428 --> 38:52.097
Thank you.
You are a good friend.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.766
Uh, what are you
talking about?

38:54.766 --> 38:57.603
Geez, Lavon, cheating
for a girl?

38:57.603 --> 38:59.337
Where have your
mayoral ethics gone?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.606
Wade, can't you

39:00.606 --> 39:02.774
ever just let us
have a nice moment?

39:02.774 --> 39:04.776
Sorry.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.779
* *

39:09.581 --> 39:11.249
DIDI:
Lemon! Lemon.
Hi.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.685
I was just about
to call you.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.488
Listen, I so, so appreciate
you finding me that job,

39:16.488 --> 39:17.723
but the thing is, well,

39:17.723 --> 39:19.290
I don't want
to go to Montgomery.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.893
But, honey,
it's a good job.
It's a great salary.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.795
I know, but I got
offered another job

39:23.795 --> 39:25.831
right here in BlueBell
for the same exact money!

39:25.831 --> 39:28.767
What? What job?
I start next week.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.636
I'm gonna be George Tucker's
assistant.

39:30.636 --> 39:31.970
Which is great,
right? 'Cause with him

39:31.970 --> 39:33.371
being your fiancé,
you and I'll

39:33.371 --> 39:35.140
get to see each other
all the time.

39:35.140 --> 39:38.910
George? His assistant? Yay.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.480
And the whole thing
was the mayor's idea.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.882
Oh, my God, he is so...

39:43.882 --> 39:46.084
Don't say it.

39:46.084 --> 39:51.089
He is, um, he's
just such an angel.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.926
(video game playing)

39:54.926 --> 39:58.196
What I don't get is
how you did it.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.566
Well, you must've been
cooking all night.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.902
Your Uncle Mo
would be proud of you.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.404
I don't know what you been
drinking, Lavon.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.640
You're acting crazy
as all get-out.

40:08.640 --> 40:13.311
Uh-huh. I know what I know.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.681
You did Zoe a solid.

40:15.681 --> 40:18.249
Oh, you a good guy.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.818
I don't know what

40:19.818 --> 40:21.820
you're talking about, Mr. Mayor,

40:21.820 --> 40:24.189
but, uh, Zoe Hart,
she doesn't need my help.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.658
You can just ask her yourself.

40:37.669 --> 40:42.307
Okay, well, I'll let
Dr. Breeland know you're here.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.342
that there are two doctors,
but she won't...

40:44.342 --> 40:45.744
It's okay.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.746
Now, Harold, why don't
you come on in?

40:47.746 --> 40:50.181
Right on back
in there.

40:50.181 --> 40:51.983
Uh, Mrs. Dixon,
it's gonna be a while.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.986
Um... why don't you see
Dr. Hart today?

40:54.986 --> 40:57.589
She'll take
good care of you.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.563
2:14, October 10.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.231
Write that down somewhere,
would you?

41:07.866 --> 41:09.200
Mrs. Dixon?
