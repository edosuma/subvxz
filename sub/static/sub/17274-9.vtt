Your EKG looks
a little erratic.

00:03.621 --> 00:05.990
And the blood test revealed
traces of nitrate medication.

00:06.244 --> 00:07.912
Why did you change
my medical records?

00:08.096 --> 00:10.181
Hayley Price found out
about your heart condition.

00:10.265 --> 00:11.482
Don't you want to hear
my side of the story?

00:11.600 --> 00:12.650
Unless it's you telling us

00:12.767 --> 00:14.018
that you don't have
a heart condition,

00:14.102 --> 00:16.103
it's not going to change
our position.

00:16.238 --> 00:17.688
You'll be reassigned
as a language officer

00:17.856 --> 00:19.023
in the DPD.

00:19.191 --> 00:21.609
Mueller definitely
wasn't responsible for Chicago.

Got a guy deep
in the Russian embassy

00:23.195 --> 00:25.246
who says he has proof someone
else was behind the attack.

00:25.396 --> 00:27.581
Hey! What are you
doing here?

00:27.732 --> 00:28.749
You don't live
in the building.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.000
You're following me!

00:30.118 --> 00:32.753
[Car crashes, people gasp]

00:32.904 --> 00:36.707
Roger said he had
an FSB file from a source

00:36.875 --> 00:38.876
deep in the Russian embassy.

00:39.044 --> 00:41.512
He was found
with conspiracy theories.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.547
You're suspended.
We'll get it on the next one.

00:43.715 --> 00:45.299
There's not gonna
be a next one,

00:45.433 --> 00:47.274
not for me, anyway.
You're staying for a drink.

00:47.302 --> 00:49.687

said was following him.

a work thing.

01:36.401 --> 01:38.269
You're not leaving,
are you?

01:43.975 --> 01:46.577

that coffee.

02:01.343 --> 02:04.295
Hey, Joe, what can I do
for you and the DCI?

02:04.462 --> 02:06.213
The DCI wants us to talk.

02:06.348 --> 02:08.132
Talk about what?

02:08.265 --> 02:09.967
It's better if we talk
in person--

02:10.134 --> 02:12.186
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

02:12.337 --> 02:14.221
You got it.

02:23.031 --> 02:24.698
You see him?
No.

02:24.816 --> 02:26.400
What do we have
on the security feeds

02:26.534 --> 02:28.118
from the Brunswick
train station?

02:28.236 --> 02:30.120
- I'm on it.
- Maybe he tailed Roger there.

02:30.205 --> 02:32.539
Or McQuaid could have
given him the heads-up.

02:32.690 --> 02:34.742

[Keys clacking]

02:34.859 --> 02:36.327
[Computer beeps]
There.

02:36.461 --> 02:38.462
He's there, walking away
from the accident.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.714
Okay, so this guy,
who was tailing Roger

02:40.865 --> 02:43.384
and was there
at the time of Roger's death,

02:43.534 --> 02:44.752
shows up at McQuaid's house
the next day?

02:44.869 --> 02:47.504
They definitely seemed
like they knew each other.

02:47.672 --> 02:49.006
I got to take this
to the DPD.

02:49.174 --> 02:50.974
I'll work up a game plan.

02:51.092 --> 02:53.093
If we take this to the DPD,
they'll take over.

02:53.228 --> 02:56.180
You know no one has better
access to McQuaid than I do.

02:56.314 --> 02:59.850
And you know you're
under suspension, right?

02:59.934 --> 03:01.852
I do.

03:01.936 --> 03:03.237
That's part of my plan.

03:03.388 --> 03:05.522
Mm-hmm.

03:17.952 --> 03:20.704
Annie, if you're here
to discuss your suspension,

03:20.789 --> 03:22.539
there's nothing
I can do about it.

03:22.674 --> 03:24.675
I'm resigning.

03:26.628 --> 03:28.512
Resigning?

03:30.715 --> 03:32.633
So our last conversation
didn't go the way you wanted,

03:32.767 --> 03:34.301
and you're just giving up?

03:34.436 --> 03:35.719
I'm not giving up.

03:35.887 --> 03:38.355
My place is in the field.

03:38.473 --> 03:41.392
So you're resigning
on principle?

03:41.559 --> 03:44.311
Because you haven't even tried
being an analyst.

03:44.429 --> 03:46.313
I've made up my mind.

03:47.899 --> 03:49.733
Is there something else
going on?

03:49.868 --> 03:52.202
Other than being suspended
by the Agency

03:52.287 --> 03:56.573
I've faithfully served,
no, nothing at all.

03:59.127 --> 04:00.994
Annie...

04:02.497 --> 04:05.749
I accept
that you don't view me

04:05.834 --> 04:09.753
as the kind of friend or leader
that I have tried to be.

04:09.888 --> 04:11.755
But if you resign,

04:11.890 --> 04:14.925
this is you losing faith,
not only in me and the Agency,

04:15.093 --> 04:16.927
but also in yourself.

04:39.484 --> 04:41.752
I took the liberty
of ordering you a neat one.

04:41.870 --> 04:43.954
Thank you.

04:44.122 --> 04:45.756
How are you?

04:45.874 --> 04:48.759
I know what's next
for me.

04:48.877 --> 04:50.594
What's that?

04:50.712 --> 04:52.513
You were right.

04:52.663 --> 04:55.048
The CIA is not
a two-way street.

04:55.183 --> 04:57.518
I'm worth more than they are
valuing me at,

04:57.668 --> 04:59.887
and I'm gonna make a move
to the private sector.

05:00.021 --> 05:01.939
[Chuckles]

05:02.056 --> 05:05.559
Well, that is incredible.
How about a toast?

05:05.693 --> 05:07.895
How about a job?

05:08.029 --> 05:09.646
Really?

05:09.781 --> 05:13.867
You've been trying
to recruit me since we met.

05:13.985 --> 05:15.819
Are you sure that this
is the best path?

05:15.954 --> 05:17.154
Because of my heart?

05:17.238 --> 05:19.323
No, I'm saying
because we kissed this morning.

05:19.407 --> 05:21.492
I don't want this job to prevent
what happened this morning

05:21.626 --> 05:23.494
from happening again.

How do I look?

You always look great.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.654
I was able to get
facial rec

05:53.789 --> 05:56.374
on the security photo
of our friend.

05:56.491 --> 05:57.658
His name is Allen Langer.

05:57.793 --> 05:59.911
He worked for McQuaid
up until three years ago.

06:00.045 --> 06:01.746
Allen Langer.

06:01.830 --> 06:04.582
I'll see what I can find
on the McQuaid database.

06:04.716 --> 06:08.252
Or in McQuaid's
personal computer.

06:08.420 --> 06:10.504
- What's that?
- It's called a salvage rabbit.

06:10.622 --> 06:13.257
You just need to keep it within
a meter of McQuaid's computer.

06:13.392 --> 06:14.809
That sounds easy.
What's the catch?

06:14.960 --> 06:16.561
The catch
is McQuaid Security

06:16.678 --> 06:18.179
has some of the most
sophisticated encryption

06:18.313 --> 06:19.730
on the planet.

06:19.848 --> 06:21.599
A hot sync could take
five minutes or more.

06:21.767 --> 06:23.401
Still sounds pretty
straightforward.

06:23.518 --> 06:25.269
Well, it is, except his
computer's gonna freeze up

06:25.404 --> 06:26.904
during the hot sync.

06:27.022 --> 06:29.223
So, if he tries to use it,
he'll know something's wrong.

06:29.241 --> 06:33.444
You really think McQuaid
wanted to silence Roger?

06:35.414 --> 06:36.781
Yeah. Look, Annie,

06:36.949 --> 06:38.916
we're gonna be spying
on McQuaid together,

06:39.034 --> 06:40.952
so I need to know,

06:41.119 --> 06:43.287
are you emotionally involved
with him?

06:45.123 --> 06:47.541
No. I'm not.

06:47.676 --> 06:49.627
When I talked to you
about Roger,

06:49.761 --> 06:51.681
you were in McQuaid's house
at the crack of dawn,

06:51.713 --> 06:53.965
and that was before
any of this.

06:54.099 --> 06:55.299
It's not an issue.

06:55.467 --> 06:56.884
My head's in the game.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.638
Okay, that's all
I need to know.

07:06.278 --> 07:08.396
In the aftermath
of the DNI inquest,

07:08.530 --> 07:11.282
which, let's face it,
was a debacle,

07:11.400 --> 07:12.700
we have some serious
questions

07:12.851 --> 07:15.236

respond to your directorship.

I'm not talking

07:18.156 --> 07:20.541
about Annie Walker.
She is already gone.

07:20.692 --> 07:22.159
Then who are you
talking about?

07:22.244 --> 07:25.129
The DCI believes that
Auggie Anderson was involved

07:25.247 --> 07:27.298
with Walker's efforts
to lie to our Agency,

07:27.416 --> 07:29.133
to hide her heart condition.

07:29.251 --> 07:30.334
Now, she may be gone,

07:30.502 --> 07:32.253
but the questions
should be expanded to Anderson.

07:32.387 --> 07:33.971

Auggie Anderson
is one of my top handlers.

07:37.259 --> 07:39.260
I've trusted him
with a great deal in the past,

07:39.394 --> 07:41.479
and he's never let me down.

07:41.596 --> 07:43.264
He's also a friend.

07:43.398 --> 07:44.598
Well, that's worse.

07:44.733 --> 07:46.233
Your employee,
who's also your friend,

07:46.384 --> 07:48.019
seems to be lying to you.

07:48.153 --> 07:49.687
So what are you
asking me to do?

07:49.855 --> 07:51.176
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

07:51.189 --> 07:53.024
I'm informing you
of a potential problem.

07:53.191 --> 07:56.494
How you handle that
is up to you.

08:53.468 --> 08:54.885
Mr. McQuaid is not in
right now,

08:55.003 --> 08:56.087
but I can take a message.

08:56.171 --> 08:58.639
You are?
Annie Walker.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.892
Why don't you come with me?
Your office is one level down.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.484
And here we are.

As soon as you finish

risk-assessing 15 skyscrapers
in Dubai.

09:22.247 --> 09:25.116
Now, as a probationary hire,

09:25.250 --> 09:27.251
you have a clearance level
of one.

09:27.369 --> 09:30.704
It's a company policy.
There are no exceptions.

09:30.822 --> 09:32.673
I understand.

that I introduce

10:11.913 --> 10:16.467
I got to see Annie work
firsthand on a few operations.

10:16.585 --> 10:20.304
Working side by side,
I witnessed a dedicated patriot

10:20.388 --> 10:24.258
who will pursue a target
at any cost

10:24.392 --> 10:27.511
and a comrade who will gladly
share a bourbon with you

10:27.679 --> 10:29.763

Welcome aboard.
Thanks.

10:42.611 --> 10:44.995
My first day at the farm
they gave me a two-hour lecture

10:45.080 --> 10:46.697
on the code of conduct.
[Laughs]

10:46.865 --> 10:48.065
We do things differently here.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.251
We should speak
in the next couple of days

10:50.368 --> 10:52.036
about what your first assignment
might be.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.205
Okay.

10:57.742 --> 11:00.044
I wish you'd given me
the heads-up about this.

11:00.212 --> 11:02.092
Well, you knew that Annie
was coming over to us.

11:02.097 --> 11:03.380
But not that you were gonna
promote her

11:03.548 --> 11:04.682
to the field immediately.

11:04.799 --> 11:06.717
This is the right thing.
Trust me.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.641
Well, I knew we got
a fast-track hire,

11:13.775 --> 11:16.143
but I can't believe
it's you.

11:16.278 --> 11:19.230
A lot's changed
in the past couple days.

11:19.364 --> 11:21.482
I know.
Joan told me.

11:21.616 --> 11:24.201
- She's upset.
- She cares about you.

11:24.319 --> 11:26.203
But I get it.

11:26.288 --> 11:27.849
You're not the only one
who left the CIA

11:27.906 --> 11:30.791
and found a home
at McQuaid Security.

11:30.942 --> 11:32.660
Thanks.

11:32.794 --> 11:34.912
Welcome aboard.

11:36.965 --> 11:38.916
She's up to something.

11:39.050 --> 11:41.585
You didn't think the private
sector would snatch her up?

11:41.720 --> 11:43.587
McQuaid was just lucky he had
a personal connection with her,

11:43.755 --> 11:46.090
just like he had with me.
No, none of this adds up.

11:46.174 --> 11:50.094
Why would she close the chapter
on her CIA career so quickly?

11:50.228 --> 11:51.262
Because your protocol

11:51.396 --> 11:53.264
mandated that she be relegated
to a desk.

11:53.398 --> 11:55.065
You know that doesn't work
for Annie.

11:55.183 --> 11:56.567
So then why
didn't she fight it?

11:56.685 --> 11:58.125
There's got to be something
going on.

11:58.153 --> 12:00.404
So you think she's running
an Op on her own?

12:00.522 --> 12:02.439
Well, this is Annie
we're talking about.

12:02.607 --> 12:04.525
I'll keep an eye on her.

12:06.624 --> 12:09.843
I thought I would have been
able to get in there by now.

12:09.961 --> 12:12.629
Maybe we should try
plan "B."

12:12.764 --> 12:13.847
What's plan "B"?

12:13.965 --> 12:15.599
There isn't one.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.768
Do we need
to think of one?

12:20.521 --> 12:21.555
What are you getting at?

12:21.639 --> 12:23.557
Annie, this just
doesn't sound like you.

12:23.725 --> 12:24.808
Is something going on?

12:24.942 --> 12:27.027
There's no problem.

12:27.111 --> 12:29.946
Okay.

12:34.068 --> 12:36.055
Costa, I'm back from state.
What's my next meeting?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.341
I am.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.476
You had to make
an appointment?

12:40.594 --> 12:43.229
I did. I saw you more of you
when I worked at the CIA

12:43.380 --> 12:44.680
than I do now.

12:44.815 --> 12:47.066
Well, it's my company,
and while it doesn't leave me

12:47.217 --> 12:49.040
with a lot of personal time,
I do what needs to be done.

12:49.041 --> 12:50.908
And I-I give it
everything that I have.

12:51.076 --> 12:53.244
I know.

12:53.328 --> 12:55.246
I, uh...

12:55.381 --> 12:59.659
I'm wondering why you still
haven't given me an assignment.

13:01.191 --> 13:03.326
Is it because of my heart,

13:03.494 --> 13:06.546
or is there
something else?

13:06.696 --> 13:10.082
I am just waiting
for the right opportunity.

13:11.969 --> 13:15.805
You were talking
in your speech about trust,

13:15.889 --> 13:18.891
but I feel like
you're holding something back.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.012
[Chuckles]
You know what? You're right.

13:23.096 --> 13:24.313
I should have found you
something.

13:24.398 --> 13:26.349
So I'm gonna do that right now.

13:26.483 --> 13:29.018
Is that the stuff
from Venezuela?

13:32.055 --> 13:34.440
The very same.

13:34.558 --> 13:37.243
[Laughs]

13:37.361 --> 13:39.695
Would you like a drink?

13:39.863 --> 13:43.082
I would love one.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.084
[Sighs]

13:48.071 --> 13:49.422
You know,

13:49.573 --> 13:53.543
I hope that you have
a little time,

13:53.677 --> 13:56.012
because this
is the kind of stuff

13:56.129 --> 13:58.548
that you need to sip.

13:58.715 --> 14:00.766
I've got at least
five minutes.

14:04.888 --> 14:07.557
I've been digging through
McQuaid's files one by one--

14:07.691 --> 14:10.560
nothing suspicious,
nothing on Allen Langer.

14:10.644 --> 14:13.062
And then I found a file
that is heavily encrypted.

14:13.197 --> 14:15.198
Took me nearly an hour
to crack it.

14:15.315 --> 14:18.150
All that was inside the file
was a collection of profiles.

14:18.285 --> 14:19.819
The names on these profiles

14:19.936 --> 14:23.322
are all former McQuaid employees
with strong tactical training.

14:25.108 --> 14:26.459
- Well, that's Langer.
- Yep.

14:26.577 --> 14:28.244
Each profile has
payment information

14:28.378 --> 14:31.080
and is filed
under a code name--Flint.

14:31.215 --> 14:32.748
- What's Flint?
- I don't know.

14:32.883 --> 14:35.384
Look who else is in Flint.

14:35.469 --> 14:37.136
Borz?

14:37.287 --> 14:39.422
One and the same.

14:39.556 --> 14:42.391
Borz Altan
worked for Flint.

14:42.509 --> 14:46.145
There are payments to Borz
up until just before Chicago.

14:48.565 --> 14:50.683
So McQuaid lied.

14:50.817 --> 14:53.069
Borz worked for him
for more than four months.

14:53.186 --> 14:55.271
The only question is
how deep those lies go.

14:55.405 --> 14:59.525
Annie, there's a version of this
that ties McQuaid to Chicago.

15:05.876 --> 15:07.186
You wanted to see me?

15:07.266 --> 15:09.150
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.

15:09.301 --> 15:10.852
What's up?

15:10.986 --> 15:12.437
Why don't you have a seat?

15:12.521 --> 15:14.439
No, I'm good.

15:16.013 --> 15:17.814
Is this
about the DNI investigation?

15:17.931 --> 15:21.234
Exactly.
They're angry about Annie.

15:21.385 --> 15:23.936
And they're angry about you.

15:24.071 --> 15:25.688
Because I'm Annie's friend?

15:25.856 --> 15:28.241
Because they think
you had something to do

15:28.359 --> 15:31.110
with covering up
Annie's medical condition.

15:31.228 --> 15:33.413
Annie kept that secret
from everyone.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.198
You're not everyone.

15:37.534 --> 15:42.205
Auggie, I'm asking you
as a friend.

15:42.339 --> 15:44.841
I can't protect you
if you lie to me.

15:44.925 --> 15:48.211
You don't need
to protect me.

15:52.966 --> 15:55.385
Okay. We're good.

15:55.552 --> 15:56.552
That's it?

15:56.637 --> 15:58.938
That's it.

16:06.063 --> 16:08.147
[Distant siren blaring]

16:08.282 --> 16:10.983
[Sighs]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

16:11.101 --> 16:12.201
I'm told it's important.

16:12.286 --> 16:14.570
Matters of national security,
I'm afraid.

16:14.705 --> 16:16.656
How can I help?

16:16.790 --> 16:18.270
Three weeks ago
you treated this woman

16:18.275 --> 16:19.542
after a car accident.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.411
Her file says
that her blood work is clean,

16:21.545 --> 16:24.414
but I'm wondering why you didn't
discover her heart condition.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.049
How did you get a hold
of her file?

16:26.166 --> 16:28.251
You're not answering
my question.

16:28.385 --> 16:30.803
It's illegal for me to share
any patient information.

16:33.123 --> 16:35.591
Let me put this
in perspective for you.

16:35.759 --> 16:38.094
I can make a call,
have this hospital shut down,

16:38.262 --> 16:41.431
and have a team of analysts
comb through all your files,

16:41.515 --> 16:43.316
or you can just confirm
what I already know.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.268
When this woman came in here
that night,

16:45.402 --> 16:47.653
did you discover
her heart condition?

16:49.156 --> 16:50.273
Yes.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.108
And you put it
in the hospital record?

16:52.276 --> 16:54.577
Yes.
Standard procedure.

16:54.695 --> 16:57.163
Are you aware that it was
erased from her file?

16:57.314 --> 16:58.748
No.

16:58.866 --> 17:01.334
Thanks, Doc.

17:01.452 --> 17:02.702
[Sighs]

17:02.836 --> 17:04.287
- Arthur.
- Annie.

17:04.421 --> 17:05.755
I wonder if I could get
your help with something.

17:05.873 --> 17:07.623
I need help accessing
the database.

17:07.758 --> 17:09.625
I'm only
a level one clearance.

17:11.627 --> 17:13.108
What do you need my help
looking into?

17:13.163 --> 17:15.298
I just need to search
for something.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.133
Well, if you want to use
my key code

17:17.267 --> 17:18.351
to access secure files,

17:18.502 --> 17:19.519
you're gonna have
to tell me why.

17:19.636 --> 17:22.137
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

17:24.474 --> 17:26.192
Well, who's running the Op?

17:26.343 --> 17:28.895
I mean, I know Joan's
out of the loop.

17:29.029 --> 17:30.646
It's not an Op.

17:30.781 --> 17:32.949
I'm not working
for the CIA.

17:33.066 --> 17:35.651
Annie, no spy worth his salt

17:35.736 --> 17:37.036
would agree to the deal
you're offering me.

17:37.187 --> 17:40.072
You need to read me in
if you need my help.

17:40.207 --> 17:42.708
I can't. I'm sorry.

17:42.859 --> 17:45.161
Um, forget I said anything.

17:51.802 --> 17:53.803
- Annie.
- Hi.

17:53.921 --> 17:56.088
Can I talk to you
for a second?

17:56.223 --> 17:58.558
No problem.

18:03.230 --> 18:07.183
I've got your assignment,
like you asked.

18:07.317 --> 18:09.268
Thanks.

18:09.403 --> 18:10.520
South Africa--

18:10.687 --> 18:12.104
I haven't been there
in a while.

18:12.239 --> 18:13.990
I think
you're gonna do great.

18:14.107 --> 18:16.859
Our team on the ground there
is exceptional.

18:16.994 --> 18:19.695
I think you're really gonna
like the assignment.

18:21.748 --> 18:24.700
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said to me.

18:24.835 --> 18:26.619
Um...

18:26.736 --> 18:27.870
Your instincts--

18:28.038 --> 18:32.458
you knew that I was keeping
something from you.

18:32.593 --> 18:34.877
And I have something
to tell you.

18:38.382 --> 18:39.632
Uh...

18:39.766 --> 18:41.884
I haven't been honest
with you, Annie.

18:46.723 --> 18:48.391
[Sighs]
I...

18:48.525 --> 18:50.026
This has been weighing on me
for quite a while,

18:50.110 --> 18:52.361
so I just need to put it
all out there, okay?

18:52.446 --> 18:54.063
Okay.

18:57.434 --> 19:00.369
You and I--
we started with a lie.

19:02.573 --> 19:04.207
The very first thing
you asked me about was Borz,

19:04.324 --> 19:05.708
and I didn't tell you
the truth.

19:05.826 --> 19:08.995
He--he didn't just do
a few missions for me.

19:11.582 --> 19:15.751
- No?
- No. He...

19:15.886 --> 19:18.588
The truth is that he did
many missions for me.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.426
He was a member of...

19:26.013 --> 19:27.897
An elite group...

19:30.267 --> 19:32.768
That I employ
outside of my company.

19:32.903 --> 19:36.105
This group has contracts
for the D.O.D.

19:36.273 --> 19:39.742
And some of the other
federal government agencies--

19:39.860 --> 19:41.911
the highest clearance,
the most secretive missions.

19:42.029 --> 19:44.497
And I am--I am committing
a federal crime

19:44.648 --> 19:48.034
by having this conversation
with you right now.

19:48.151 --> 19:49.285
[Sighs]

19:49.453 --> 19:52.755
Uh, uh, an elite group,
like--like black Ops?

19:54.875 --> 19:57.510
Code name--Flint.

19:57.661 --> 20:00.796
When I was, uh, 9 years old,

20:00.931 --> 20:04.467
I went on a fishing trip
with my dad on the Flint River.

20:04.601 --> 20:07.520
Why are you telling me
this now?

20:10.023 --> 20:12.024
Because I like you, Annie.

20:13.944 --> 20:15.528
And I don't know exactly
where we stand right now,

20:15.679 --> 20:19.982
but I figure the truth
is a pretty good place to start.

20:20.150 --> 20:24.487
We can't get any closer if we
have these secrets between us.

20:33.463 --> 20:35.631
Auggie.

20:35.749 --> 20:37.500
Hey.
Thank you.

20:37.668 --> 20:39.502
What did you find out
about Flint?

20:39.670 --> 20:41.504
McQuaid came clean about it.

20:41.638 --> 20:43.673
What? Why?
How'd that happen?

20:43.757 --> 20:44.840
He did it on his own.

20:44.975 --> 20:47.176
He said he wanted to be
completely open with me.

20:47.344 --> 20:49.645
He said Borz
was on the Flint payroll

20:49.763 --> 20:51.347
and that they are
a black Ops group

20:51.481 --> 20:53.683
that does classified
government ops.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.457
He said he couldn't come clean
to the CIA.

20:55.485 --> 20:56.519
He wasn't at liberty to.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.688
Why did he come clean
to you?

21:02.559 --> 21:04.443
Did he show you any proof?

21:04.561 --> 21:06.862
Proof of a clandestine
black Ops group?

21:07.030 --> 21:08.247
No, he didn't.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.282
How do you know
this isn't just more lies?

21:10.417 --> 21:11.917
This is counterespionage 101.

21:12.035 --> 21:13.836
If McQuaid knows
you're investigating him,

21:13.954 --> 21:15.705
he'll throw you a bone
to distract you from the truth.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.089
He doesn't know
I'm investigating him.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.374
You don't know that.

21:18.458 --> 21:19.842
He's a smart man
with something to hide.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.011
Maybe he can read you.
What are you saying?

21:22.129 --> 21:24.213
I think you've let
your guard down.

21:24.381 --> 21:25.464
Anyone else with this kind

21:25.599 --> 21:27.183
of incriminating evidence
piled against them,

21:27.300 --> 21:29.185
and you wouldn't hesitate
to bring them in.

21:29.302 --> 21:31.604
My gut is telling me
differently.

21:31.755 --> 21:34.023
What if Flint is doing
aboveboard Ops?

21:34.141 --> 21:36.892
Your gut's telling you this
or your heart?

21:38.812 --> 21:39.862
Auggie.

21:39.946 --> 21:41.697
Annie, I think
he's playing you.

21:41.815 --> 21:43.399
I've got to take this to Joan.

21:43.483 --> 21:45.735
Please don't take this
to Joan.

21:45.819 --> 21:47.236
Let me see this through.

21:47.404 --> 21:49.455
Let me do this my way.

21:49.573 --> 21:51.540
You know, I asked you
to give me the same trust

21:51.658 --> 21:54.043
when we were in Paris,
and you didn't listen to me.

21:54.161 --> 21:56.161
You sacrificed Natasha
for the sake of the mission.

21:56.279 --> 21:58.464
- I should have trusted you.
- Now you want me to--

21:58.615 --> 22:00.216
- I should have trusted you
in Paris,

22:00.300 --> 22:02.418
and now I am asking you
to trust me.

22:02.502 --> 22:05.755
Can you do that?

22:05.889 --> 22:07.890
I'll give you a day.

22:30.668 --> 22:32.919
This is what I can tell you--

22:33.087 --> 22:34.504
I'm looking for intel

22:34.639 --> 22:37.808
on a black Op team
called "Flint."

22:37.925 --> 22:39.593
Have you heard of them?

22:39.727 --> 22:41.812
No. Why?

22:41.929 --> 22:44.765
This is about helping McQuaid.
Can you trust me on that?

22:46.434 --> 22:48.351
What do you need from me?

22:48.486 --> 22:51.188
I need you to go to your
top-level government contacts

22:51.322 --> 22:53.824
and find out
if the Department of Defense,

22:53.941 --> 22:55.692
the DIA,
even the White House,

22:55.810 --> 22:57.527
uses these guys.

22:57.645 --> 23:01.615
I need to verify that Flint does
black Ops for our government.

23:01.699 --> 23:04.451
As opposed to?

23:04.585 --> 23:07.454
You don't want to know.

23:08.873 --> 23:10.457
You can't see this,
but it's a file

23:10.625 --> 23:12.008
from Georgetown Hospital.

23:12.126 --> 23:13.176
Annie's medical records

23:13.327 --> 23:15.462
from the night
of her car accident...

23:15.596 --> 23:18.715
Re-corrected.

23:18.850 --> 23:20.467
Well, I'm glad the doctor
stuck with it.

23:20.601 --> 23:22.686
We really do have
great health care.

23:22.837 --> 23:25.472
You hacked the hospital
and our databases

23:25.556 --> 23:29.142
and changed her records.

23:29.227 --> 23:30.828
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:30.895 --> 23:32.729
Auggie...

23:32.864 --> 23:35.065
You're lying.

23:35.199 --> 23:36.483
Send me to a polygraph.

23:36.617 --> 23:38.568
I'm trying
to help you here, man.

23:38.703 --> 23:39.903
Help me?
You think I need help?

23:40.020 --> 23:41.420
Yes, I do,
because I think right now

23:41.539 --> 23:44.741
I'm the only friend
on the seventh floor you've got.

23:44.876 --> 23:46.827
So they want me out?

23:48.796 --> 23:50.247
If I show them this file,
they will.

23:50.381 --> 23:51.581
Then don't.

23:51.716 --> 23:53.800
You lied to me,

23:53.918 --> 23:55.669
and you still are.

23:55.803 --> 23:57.804
What else is going on
that I should know?

23:59.206 --> 24:01.508
[Sighs]

24:01.642 --> 24:05.061
What is this shit, Auggie?
I thought we trusted each other.

24:05.212 --> 24:08.064
Last year, I was right next
to you taking the same risks.

24:08.215 --> 24:09.536
I helped Annie
fake her own death.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.234
I helped you track down
Henry Wilcox.

24:11.352 --> 24:13.653
And you're gonna
shut me out now?

24:15.222 --> 24:16.690
I'm sorry, Calder.

24:27.502 --> 24:29.169
I'm opening
a full investigation

24:29.287 --> 24:30.537
into your involvement

24:30.705 --> 24:32.923
in falsifying
Annie Walker's medical records.

24:33.073 --> 24:34.257
You're what?

24:34.408 --> 24:36.343
You're not to handle
any more of my operatives

24:36.460 --> 24:37.544
until further notice.

24:37.678 --> 24:39.129
You have got
to be kidding me.

24:39.246 --> 24:41.715
Don't you dare
act surprised.

24:41.883 --> 24:44.551
Close the door
on your way out.

24:54.228 --> 24:56.062
[Door closes]

25:02.320 --> 25:03.653
Anything?

25:03.788 --> 25:05.789
I had to call in
just about every favor I had,

25:05.940 --> 25:07.123
and it still wasn't enough.

25:07.274 --> 25:09.409
You didn't find anything?

25:10.611 --> 25:12.712
This is serious stuff.

25:12.830 --> 25:14.548
A good friend,
who I'm not gonna be naming,

25:14.665 --> 25:15.945
completely denied
and discredited

25:16.050 --> 25:18.335
the notion of there
being a black-bag unit

25:18.452 --> 25:20.420
employed
by the Department of Defense.

25:20.555 --> 25:22.472
So Flint doesn't do
any government work?

25:22.623 --> 25:24.391
But then he said
if such a company existed,

25:24.508 --> 25:27.177
the D.O.D. would use
a fax line

25:27.294 --> 25:28.812
to make
the initial communication

25:28.963 --> 25:30.397
with said black Ops unit.

25:30.514 --> 25:34.901
So Flint is a legitimate
government black Ops team?

25:35.019 --> 25:37.103
It looks that way.

25:37.238 --> 25:38.655
I had another friend at NSA

25:38.773 --> 25:40.607
who was able to produce
a physical address

25:40.741 --> 25:42.742
from that a fax line.

25:42.860 --> 25:45.028
I can't thank you enough.

26:05.383 --> 26:07.601
[Engine turns off]

26:46.057 --> 26:48.508
[Beeps]

28:08.589 --> 28:11.424
[Distant clatter]

28:25.940 --> 28:27.273
[Gasps]

28:27.408 --> 28:29.609
What are you doing here?

28:29.744 --> 28:31.694
I followed you here.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.415
McQuaid may give you
the benefit of the doubt,

28:35.533 --> 28:38.368
but I know you're spying on us
for the CIA.

28:38.502 --> 28:41.121
What are you talking about?

28:41.255 --> 28:42.622
You showed up barely a day

28:42.757 --> 28:44.457
after you got bounced
out from Langley.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.259
Can't be a coincidence.

28:46.343 --> 28:50.764
They suspended you so you could
infiltrate McQuaid Security.

28:52.833 --> 28:53.967
That's not true.

28:54.101 --> 28:55.468
You met with your handler.

28:55.636 --> 28:57.937
You met with Arthur
outside the office,

28:58.055 --> 28:59.439
and now this place.

28:59.557 --> 29:01.441
[Distant loud clatter]

29:01.559 --> 29:04.227
I'm gonna ask you one time.

29:04.361 --> 29:05.728
You know who's down there?

29:05.863 --> 29:09.199
I told you,
I followed you.

29:12.186 --> 29:14.037
You first.

30:04.121 --> 30:06.506
[Gasps]

30:46.046 --> 30:48.915
[Both breathing heavily]

30:58.937 --> 31:00.738
Did you hit him?

31:00.856 --> 31:02.773
He got away.

31:02.908 --> 31:04.825
Ugh!

31:06.078 --> 31:07.361
Who's this guy?

31:07.496 --> 31:09.747
He used to work for us.

31:09.865 --> 31:11.949
I have no idea
what he's doing here.

31:12.117 --> 31:13.951
Why should I believe you?

31:14.086 --> 31:16.621
Well, I just saved your life.
Do you believe that?

31:16.788 --> 31:18.623
Here, put that on your face
and press tight.

31:18.757 --> 31:21.092
[Exhales sharply]

31:21.176 --> 31:22.677
[Sighs]

31:22.794 --> 31:25.513
- What's he doing here?
- That's what I want to know.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.160
Calder, I was just coming
to see you.

31:33.221 --> 31:34.522
Can it wait?

31:34.673 --> 31:37.642
Sacrificing the career of an
immeasurable tech op and friend?

31:37.776 --> 31:40.111
No, it cannot wait.
Joan, Auggie made his own bed.

31:40.228 --> 31:42.613
Auggie has been
a loyal handler.

31:42.698 --> 31:44.231
Are we gonna punish him
for that?

31:44.366 --> 31:46.233
We don't know to what extent
he'll be punished.

31:46.351 --> 31:48.319
With all due respect,
that is a cop-out.

31:48.453 --> 31:51.288
It's gonna be dire,
and you know it.

31:51.406 --> 31:52.990
If you're gonna be
Machiavellian, do it.

31:53.158 --> 31:55.493
But don't be a hypocrite.
I need to be crystal clear

31:55.627 --> 31:57.378
with my operatives--
if you lie to me,

31:57.529 --> 31:58.996
go behind the back
of the Agency,

31:59.131 --> 32:00.297
there will be consequences.

32:00.415 --> 32:02.583
So you're gonna play
that card?

32:02.718 --> 32:04.168
What card?

32:04.302 --> 32:05.503
I just didn't expect you
to be the one to call out

32:05.637 --> 32:07.277
somebody else for their secrets.
So, what-

32:07.372 --> 32:09.173
you're gonna leverage me
if I leverage Auggie?

32:09.341 --> 32:11.301
I'm saying I know you're
gonna do the right thing.

32:15.295 --> 32:17.167
Got here as fast
as I could.

32:17.168 --> 32:18.452
What do we have?

32:18.586 --> 32:20.370
It looks like
an explosion went off

32:20.505 --> 32:21.922
in the center of this room.

32:22.039 --> 32:25.759
What would McQuaid
want to detonate in here?

32:27.462 --> 32:29.212
Grab a light
and scan the area.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.381
I want to see
the whole thing.

32:31.499 --> 32:34.551
It looks like
there were walls here.

32:37.505 --> 32:39.723
It's the outline
of a structure.

32:39.857 --> 32:41.358
Does McQuaid Security
do mock-ups

32:41.509 --> 32:43.226
of the Ops
you're planning?

32:43.361 --> 32:44.978
Yes.

32:45.112 --> 32:46.279
Full scale?

32:46.397 --> 32:48.277
Well, you know McQuaid.
He replicates an embassy

32:48.316 --> 32:51.485
we're about to storm
or an outpost we're gonna secure

32:51.619 --> 32:54.037
with intense detail.

32:59.693 --> 33:02.496
It must be a Flint Op.

33:10.972 --> 33:12.839
What?

33:15.593 --> 33:17.477
This is a bullpen.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.514
Four offices,
an interrogation room,

33:20.681 --> 33:22.933
and a bullpen in the center.

33:26.487 --> 33:29.239
What are you talking about?

33:29.390 --> 33:31.691
It's the Chicago facility.

33:34.061 --> 33:36.029
This is where they planned
the Chicago attack.

33:36.163 --> 33:38.448
You can't be sure.

33:38.566 --> 33:40.700
I was supposed to die
in that blast.

33:40.835 --> 33:42.869
Walking through that office
with Charlie

33:43.037 --> 33:47.424
has played over and over again
in my mind ever since.

33:47.575 --> 33:49.376
I know it's Chicago.

33:49.510 --> 33:51.378
Well, maybe McQuaid built
a replica to study the blast.

33:51.512 --> 33:53.463
Maybe he was contracted
to look for clues.

33:53.598 --> 33:55.181
Were you?

33:55.299 --> 33:57.968
Not to my knowledge.

33:58.102 --> 34:01.555
You say McQuaid goes all the
way with these practice runs.

34:01.689 --> 34:05.642
If he was going
to use explosives in an op,

34:05.776 --> 34:07.861
would he detonate
in the rehearsal?

34:07.979 --> 34:11.147
Always.

34:11.264 --> 34:14.400
Semtex is what
Mykola Altan used

34:14.534 --> 34:16.402
to take out
the Chicago facility.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.655
If the chemical
signature here

34:18.789 --> 34:20.907
matches what we found
in Chicago,

34:21.042 --> 34:24.744
then we can be sure this is
where they planned the attack.

34:24.911 --> 34:29.498
My former student,
a serviceman, a patriot...

34:29.634 --> 34:31.835
And now we're saying
he's a terrorist?

34:31.969 --> 34:34.254
I don't believe it.

34:34.422 --> 34:36.089
Not Ryan.

34:36.223 --> 34:39.926
This doesn't make
any sense.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.929
It's time we took this
to Langley.

34:46.233 --> 34:49.101
[Whispering indistinctly]

34:51.022 --> 34:52.938
What did the lab say?

34:54.992 --> 34:56.242
It's a match.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.389
The Semtex used in Chicago

34:58.390 --> 35:00.641
was the same you found
in McQuaid's facility.

35:03.595 --> 35:05.063
What could be his motive?

35:05.213 --> 35:07.932
Caitlyn helped me access
McQuaid Security's accounting.

35:08.067 --> 35:10.268
To put it bluntly,
before Chicago,

35:10.402 --> 35:12.103
that company was about
to go bankrupt.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.355
Did you know that?

35:14.490 --> 35:17.191
I knew we were discussing
selling large stock options

35:17.359 --> 35:19.694
to a handful
of foreign investors,

35:19.828 --> 35:21.662
but I didn't realize
the company was in peril.

35:21.747 --> 35:25.366
McQuaid lost 9
of his last 13 bids.

35:25.501 --> 35:27.181
Then he hired Arthur,
and Chicago happened.

35:27.252 --> 35:29.837
With Arthur's access
to CIA contacts,

35:29.955 --> 35:32.507
McQuaid got
what he always wanted--

35:32.624 --> 35:34.042
booming business.

35:34.126 --> 35:36.210
Is this true?

35:36.378 --> 35:39.013
Was Chicago a game changer
for your company?

35:39.131 --> 35:41.049
Yes.

35:41.216 --> 35:43.601
Pull McQuaid in.

35:51.527 --> 35:53.394
Annie.

36:03.822 --> 36:06.541
I know you don't work
for me anymore,

36:06.658 --> 36:09.127
but great job.

36:10.996 --> 36:13.047
Thanks.

36:21.757 --> 36:23.391
How are you holding up?

36:23.509 --> 36:25.226
Oh, I'm questioning
all my instincts.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.761
Other than that,
I'm great.

36:26.895 --> 36:29.430
Sounds like you need a drink.
Let's make that happen.

36:29.565 --> 36:32.100
Sounds good.
Let me change into something

36:32.234 --> 36:33.851
that doesn't have
Caitlyn's blood on it,

36:33.969 --> 36:35.853
and I'll meet you there.
Okay.

36:40.692 --> 36:42.076
Auggie.

36:42.194 --> 36:44.245
It's Miller time
for me, Calder.

36:44.363 --> 36:46.330
Did you hand off all your
operatives like I asked you to?

36:46.448 --> 36:48.082
Yep...

36:48.200 --> 36:50.001
Like a good soldier.

36:51.503 --> 36:55.123
Good, because I want all your
attention on the McQuaid Op now.

36:57.325 --> 36:58.325
What about the DCI?

36:58.377 --> 36:59.760
What about Annie's
health records?

36:59.845 --> 37:02.763
Let the sheriff worry
about that.

37:02.881 --> 37:04.715
Calder...

37:04.850 --> 37:06.467
I haven't forgotten...

37:06.552 --> 37:09.470
About how you helped Annie and I
with Henry Wilcox.

37:09.605 --> 37:11.105
I won't forget that.

37:11.223 --> 37:12.974
Just so we're clear.

37:13.142 --> 37:15.560
Have a good night,
Anderson.

37:24.686 --> 37:26.654
Annie.

37:28.073 --> 37:29.957
You scared me.

37:30.075 --> 37:32.043
Listen, I'm in trouble.

37:32.161 --> 37:35.163
There's a manhunt coming
for me--FBI, CIA, you name it.

37:36.999 --> 37:38.916
What are you talking about?

37:39.051 --> 37:40.501
A friend at Justice
tipped me off.

37:40.586 --> 37:42.720
He said that they think

37:42.871 --> 37:45.006
that I had something to do
with the Chicago attack.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.924
Why would they think that?

37:47.042 --> 37:49.143
I don't know.

37:49.261 --> 37:52.597
I think I'm being set up.

37:52.731 --> 37:55.016
Come inside.

37:55.150 --> 37:56.734
No matter
what happens, Annie,

37:56.885 --> 37:58.325
I want you to know
that I'm innocent.

37:58.437 --> 38:00.104
You know that, right?
Of course.

38:00.239 --> 38:04.075
I mean, I-I have
some enemies, but...

38:07.446 --> 38:08.913
[Scoffs]

38:09.064 --> 38:10.498
What are you doing?

38:10.616 --> 38:13.618
I'm taking you in.

38:26.177 --> 38:29.259
How could you think
that I did this?

38:29.260 --> 38:32.679
I saw Allen Langer
at your house that morning.

38:32.797 --> 38:34.298
He's an employee of mine.

38:34.466 --> 38:36.133
I know he works for Flint.

38:36.301 --> 38:38.469
You had him kill Roger Bennett

38:38.636 --> 38:40.637
after he found out the truth
about Chicago.

38:40.722 --> 38:42.473
[Siren wailing]
Chicago?

38:42.607 --> 38:45.142
Are you saying that Allen
was involved in Chicago,

38:45.310 --> 38:46.810
or is he saying that I was?

38:46.945 --> 38:49.813
He didn't have to.

38:49.948 --> 38:53.066
I found the bunker
where you planned the attack.

38:53.151 --> 38:56.703
Annie, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:56.821 --> 38:59.156
What bunker?
Ah, step back.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.325
Okay.

39:07.715 --> 39:08.832
Someone is setting me up.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.667
And after everything
that I've seen,

39:10.835 --> 39:12.753
that someone could be you.

39:14.088 --> 39:15.923
Me?

39:16.057 --> 39:17.925
You coming to my company
three days ago,

39:18.059 --> 39:20.844
and this situation
can't be a coincidence.

39:22.430 --> 39:25.566
You know, a spy's tool
of last resort is his intuition,

39:25.683 --> 39:28.519
and my gut is telling me
to trust you.

39:31.439 --> 39:33.690
And now I'm asking you

39:33.825 --> 39:36.910
to trust your intuition.

39:37.028 --> 39:39.163
You have the best instincts
of anyone that I have ever met.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.198
Don't ignore them now.

39:41.282 --> 39:44.251
Think about every moment
that you have shared with me.

39:44.369 --> 39:46.537
I mean, that is real...

39:46.704 --> 39:48.672
Not this.

39:53.261 --> 39:55.379
Don't, Ryan.

40:03.271 --> 40:06.190
If you think...

40:06.307 --> 40:10.027
that I am capable
of this atrocity,

40:10.111 --> 40:12.863
then shoot me...

40:12.981 --> 40:14.698
Because I'm not gonna spend
the next six months

40:14.816 --> 40:17.117
in some dungeon at Langley
waiting for whoever set me up

40:17.235 --> 40:19.286
to carry out
the rest of their plan.

40:21.239 --> 40:23.907
I have to get
to the bottom of this.

40:42.093 --> 40:43.560
What the hell is going on?

40:43.678 --> 40:45.762
You really believe
McQuaid Security

40:45.897 --> 40:46.930
is behind Chicago?

40:47.098 --> 40:48.578
If you'll pardon me
for a second, Joe,

40:48.600 --> 40:51.768
my responsibility
is to the truth.

40:51.853 --> 40:54.404
Auggie Anderson and Annie Walker
uncovered the truth

40:54.522 --> 40:56.156
about McQuaid's involvement,
while the rest of us,

40:56.274 --> 40:59.326
myself included,
were ready to close a case

40:59.444 --> 41:00.777
that had yet to be solved.

41:00.912 --> 41:03.947
I won't reprimand Auggie.
He's too valuable.

41:04.082 --> 41:06.833
All right.

41:06.951 --> 41:09.836
I will be sure to let the DCI
know how you feel.

41:09.954 --> 41:12.005
You do that.

41:12.123 --> 41:15.042
Have him give me a call
if he has any questions.

41:24.302 --> 41:26.637
Thank you.

41:29.140 --> 41:30.641
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

41:30.775 --> 41:32.976
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah. Just a little traffic.

41:33.111 --> 41:35.062
Look, I hate to do this,
but I got to cut out.

41:35.196 --> 41:36.647
What's going on?

41:36.814 --> 41:39.032
Someone tipped McQuaid off
about the manhunt.

41:39.150 --> 41:40.150
He's in the wind.

41:40.201 --> 41:41.618
I got to get back
to Langley

41:41.703 --> 41:43.070
and help Calder
with the dragnet.

41:43.204 --> 41:44.655
Now, we've cut him off
from all of his resources,

41:44.822 --> 41:47.142
so he may be reaching out to
people he thinks he can trust.

41:47.208 --> 41:49.076
You think he'd try
to contact you?

41:50.662 --> 41:53.630
No. He's got to know
what side I'm on by now.

41:53.715 --> 41:55.582
Annie,

41:55.667 --> 41:57.468
I shouldn't have thought
you were compromised.

41:57.502 --> 41:58.835
You did great work.

41:58.970 --> 42:01.672
I'll let you know
when we find him.
