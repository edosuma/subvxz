01:10.357 --> 01:13.145
<i>With the coming
of the Second World War...</i>

01:13.486 --> 01:17.483
<i>... many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...</i>

01:17.823 --> 01:20.493
<i>... toward the freedom of the Americas.</i>

01:20.743 --> 01:23.364
<i>Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.</i>

01:23.579 --> 01:26.746
<i>But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.</i>

01:27.166 --> 01:30.831
<i>And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.</i>

01:31.879 --> 01:33.504
<i>Paris to Marseilles...</i>

01:39.512 --> 01:42.181
<i>... across the Mediterranean to Oran.</i>

01:49.522 --> 01:53.982
<i>Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...</i>

01:54.193 --> 01:56.684
<i>... to Casablanca in French Morocco.</i>

01:56.946 --> 02:01.442
<i>Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...</i>

02:01.784 --> 02:05.117
<i>... might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.</i>

02:05.496 --> 02:07.738
<i>And from Lisbon to the New World.</i>

02:07.957 --> 02:11.123
<i>But the others wait in Casablanca.</i>

02:11.794 --> 02:15.293
<i>And wait and wait...</i>

02:15.464 --> 02:17.291
<i>... and wait.</i>

02:17.466 --> 02:19.874
<i>Chattering</i>

02:26.934 --> 02:28.512
To all officers:

02:28.686 --> 02:33.562
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

02:33.774 --> 02:36.775
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

02:36.986 --> 02:40.770
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

02:41.198 --> 02:42.527
Important.

02:49.373 --> 02:50.571
<i>Speaks in French</i>

02:50.791 --> 02:52.998
<i>Siren Wailing</i>

03:14.315 --> 03:15.690
May we see your papers?

03:16.025 --> 03:17.685
I don't think I have them on me.

03:17.902 --> 03:21.187
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

03:21.363 --> 03:23.486
Yes. Here they are.

03:26.619 --> 03:29.536
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

03:29.747 --> 03:31.371
Halt!

03:32.124 --> 03:33.666
Halt!

03:33.959 --> 03:36.118
<i>Gunshot</i>

03:58.526 --> 04:01.277
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

04:01.529 --> 04:03.936
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, Madame.
Have you not heard?

04:04.115 --> 04:06.902
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

04:07.118 --> 04:09.573
Two German couriers
were found murdered in the desert.

04:09.704 --> 04:10.735
The unoccupied desert.

04:10.955 --> 04:13.446
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

04:13.624 --> 04:17.242
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

04:21.923 --> 04:23.964
Along with these unhappy refugees...

04:24.093 --> 04:26.548
...the scum of Europe
has gravitated to Casablanca.

04:26.679 --> 04:28.755
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

04:28.889 --> 04:31.926
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

04:32.143 --> 04:34.135
This place is full of vultures.

04:34.311 --> 04:37.063
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

04:37.231 --> 04:40.018
<i>- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all. Au revoir, monsieur.</i>

04:40.151 --> 04:41.728
<i>- Au revoir, Madame.
- Au revoir.</i>

04:41.861 --> 04:43.734
What an amusing little fellow.

04:43.946 --> 04:45.227
Waiter.

04:46.782 --> 04:48.609
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

04:48.784 --> 04:51.156
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

<i>Plane Engine Roaring</i>

05:07.011 --> 05:08.968
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

05:34.288 --> 05:36.197
<i>- Heil Hitler.

05:36.374 --> 05:38.413
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

05:38.626 --> 05:39.788
Thank you, thank you.

05:40.127 --> 05:44.255
May I present Captain Renault, police
prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

05:44.423 --> 05:46.463
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

05:46.801 --> 05:48.627
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

05:48.844 --> 05:51.466
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

05:51.639 --> 05:54.094
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.464
That is kind of you.

<i>Speaking in Italian</i>

06:01.941 --> 06:04.776
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

06:04.944 --> 06:08.609
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

06:08.948 --> 06:10.940
Perhaps you
weren't referring to weather.

06:11.075 --> 06:12.190
What else?

06:12.326 --> 06:14.319
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

06:14.495 --> 06:18.279
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

06:18.457 --> 06:20.284
But we know already
who the murderer is.

06:20.418 --> 06:21.497
Good. Is he in custody?

06:21.711 --> 06:24.628
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

06:24.797 --> 06:28.296
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

07:30.696 --> 07:32.938
But can't you make it just a little more?

07:33.074 --> 07:34.105
Please?

07:34.283 --> 07:37.699

Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

08:26.585 --> 08:29.919
He never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

08:30.756 --> 08:32.962
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

08:33.174 --> 08:34.456
Perhaps if you told him...

08:34.592 --> 08:37.215
...I ran the second-largest
banking house in Amsterdam.

08:37.346 --> 08:39.837
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

Excuse me.

09:23.392 --> 09:25.599
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

09:25.895 --> 09:29.394
Of all the nerve. Who do you think..?
I know there is gambling in there.

09:30.066 --> 09:32.735
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

09:32.902 --> 09:35.903
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

09:36.113 --> 09:39.150
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this...

09:39.283 --> 09:40.446
...you're much mistaken.

Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

09:44.955 --> 09:46.747
Your cash is good at the bar.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.909
What? Do you know who I am?

09:49.126 --> 09:51.083
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

09:51.295 --> 09:54.249
<i>This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.</i>

09:57.093 --> 10:01.589
Watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

10:01.764 --> 10:04.599
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

10:04.809 --> 10:08.758
- But when you first came, I thought...
- You thought what?

10:09.230 --> 10:11.436
What right do I have to think?

10:16.529 --> 10:17.774
May I?

10:18.906 --> 10:21.444
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

10:21.617 --> 10:24.286
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

10:24.453 --> 10:26.742
...today they are the honored dead.

10:27.331 --> 10:30.782
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

10:31.001 --> 10:32.116
I forgive you.

10:32.294 --> 10:33.954
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

10:34.171 --> 10:37.125
I forgot, you never drink with...
I'll have another, please.

10:38.092 --> 10:39.800
You despise me, don't you?

10:40.136 --> 10:42.175
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

10:42.388 --> 10:43.668
But why?

10:44.557 --> 10:46.799
Do you object
to the kind of business I do?

10:47.476 --> 10:51.972
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot here if I didn't help them.

10:52.148 --> 10:56.726
That's not so bad. Through ways of
my own, I provide them with exit visas.

10:56.944 --> 10:59.150
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

11:00.698 --> 11:03.734
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

11:03.951 --> 11:07.320
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

11:07.496 --> 11:11.114
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.669
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

11:14.837 --> 11:17.542
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

11:17.715 --> 11:20.799
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

11:21.135 --> 11:24.468
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

11:24.972 --> 11:26.003
Look, Rick.

11:26.849 --> 11:28.343
Know what this is?

11:28.809 --> 11:31.644
Something that even you
have never seen.

11:31.854 --> 11:34.974
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

11:35.191 --> 11:38.476
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

11:38.611 --> 11:39.642
One moment.

11:39.862 --> 11:43.112
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

11:43.282 --> 11:46.117
<i>And then, addio, Casablanca.</i>

11:46.535 --> 11:49.073
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow...

11:49.205 --> 11:52.241
...just because you despise me,
you are the only one I trust.

11:52.541 --> 11:54.333
Will you keep these for me, please?

11:54.543 --> 11:57.295
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

11:57.463 --> 12:00.215
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

12:00.383 --> 12:02.007
Please keep them for me.

12:02.218 --> 12:04.376
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

12:04.887 --> 12:06.880
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

12:07.056 --> 12:09.926
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

12:11.143 --> 12:12.175
Rick...

12:12.395 --> 12:14.471
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

12:15.815 --> 12:19.065
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my
good luck with your roulette wheel.

12:19.235 --> 12:20.349
Just a moment.

12:22.405 --> 12:26.568
I heard a rumor those two German
couriers were carrying letters of transit.

12:26.826 --> 12:28.284
Huh?

12:28.411 --> 12:32.823
Oh. I've heard that

How's business at the Blue Parrot?

14:01.837 --> 14:04.328
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

14:04.548 --> 14:07.752

- It's not for sale at any price.

- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.839
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

14:14.016 --> 14:15.973
In refugees alone
we could make a fortune...

14:16.102 --> 14:18.094
...if you'd work with me
in the black market.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.678
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

14:21.482 --> 14:23.938
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

14:24.110 --> 14:25.189
Suppose we do.

14:25.361 --> 14:27.768
When will you realize
that in this world today...

14:27.905 --> 14:30.361
...isolationism is no longer
a practical policy?

14:30.616 --> 14:33.285
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

14:33.452 --> 14:34.531
Oh, I like it fine here.

14:34.745 --> 14:36.156
He'll double what I pay you.

14:36.288 --> 14:38.614
I ain't got time to spend
what I make here.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.083

14:44.463 --> 14:46.255
The boss's private stock...

14:46.424 --> 14:48.879

Uh-oh.

14:55.057 --> 14:57.465
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.

14:57.727 --> 15:00.396

15:07.069 --> 15:09.358
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

15:09.697 --> 15:13.030
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

15:14.326 --> 15:15.571
Give me another.

15:15.745 --> 15:18.496
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

- Sascha, call a cab.

15:23.753 --> 15:26.125
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

15:26.297 --> 15:28.870

15:36.348 --> 15:38.092
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.307
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

15:40.478 --> 15:43.147
- And come right back.
- Yes, boss.

15:54.950 --> 15:56.610
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

15:56.786 --> 15:59.074
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

15:59.288 --> 16:00.948
Someday they may be scarce.

16:01.457 --> 16:03.414
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

16:03.626 --> 16:05.203
Maybe get her on the rebound.

16:05.378 --> 16:07.500
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

16:08.297 --> 16:11.132
<i>Speaking in French</i>

16:17.807 --> 16:20.808
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

16:21.018 --> 16:22.049
<i>Plane Engine Roaring</i>

16:25.147 --> 16:26.807
The plane to Lisbon.

16:31.487 --> 16:33.278
You would like to be on it?

16:33.489 --> 16:35.149
Why? What's in Lisbon?

16:35.491 --> 16:37.365
The clipper to America.

16:37.576 --> 16:40.281
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

16:40.496 --> 16:44.410
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

16:44.834 --> 16:47.503
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.330
It's a combination of all three.

16:49.547 --> 16:52.002
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

16:52.174 --> 16:54.630
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

16:54.927 --> 16:58.094
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

16:58.681 --> 17:01.088
- I was misinformed.
- Hm.

17:03.102 --> 17:04.430
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

17:04.603 --> 17:07.439
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

17:07.815 --> 17:10.021
...and the cashier
would like some money.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.605
I'll get it from the safe.

17:12.778 --> 17:14.356
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I...

17:14.530 --> 17:17.151
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

17:17.366 --> 17:19.109
I'm awfully sorry.

17:24.707 --> 17:28.372
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

17:28.544 --> 17:30.252
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

17:30.463 --> 17:31.838
A murderer, no less.

17:32.465 --> 17:36.047
If you're thinking of warning him, don't
put yourself out. He cannot escape.

17:36.260 --> 17:40.044
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

17:40.306 --> 17:43.556
<i>Speaks in French</i>

17:43.809 --> 17:46.347
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.643
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

17:48.814 --> 17:50.308
It will amuse your customers.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.976
Our entertainment's enough.

17:53.527 --> 17:55.603
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

17:55.821 --> 17:58.312
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

17:58.491 --> 18:00.649
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

18:00.826 --> 18:03.400
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

18:03.579 --> 18:05.488
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

18:05.706 --> 18:09.574
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

18:09.794 --> 18:10.908
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

18:11.087 --> 18:13.210
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

18:13.422 --> 18:16.257
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

18:16.425 --> 18:17.919
How observant you are.

18:18.260 --> 18:20.965
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

18:21.097 --> 18:22.128
Yeah?

18:22.431 --> 18:24.720
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

18:25.851 --> 18:27.844
There are many exit visas
sold in this café...

18:27.978 --> 18:29.852
...but we know
that you've never sold one.

18:30.356 --> 18:32.514
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

18:32.691 --> 18:34.980
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

18:35.152 --> 18:36.397
That is another reason.

18:36.612 --> 18:39.364
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

18:39.573 --> 18:42.444
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

18:42.618 --> 18:45.109
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

18:45.496 --> 18:46.907
Victor Laszlo?

18:47.081 --> 18:49.654
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.826
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

18:52.002 --> 18:55.454
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

18:55.631 --> 18:58.632
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

18:58.926 --> 19:00.883
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

19:01.095 --> 19:03.218
- Manages what?
- His escape.

19:03.431 --> 19:05.304
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

19:05.474 --> 19:07.348
He escaped from a concentration camp.

19:07.476 --> 19:09.469
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

19:09.603 --> 19:13.435
- This is the end of the chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

19:13.649 --> 19:14.978
Is that a serious offer?

19:15.317 --> 19:17.476
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

19:17.820 --> 19:20.489
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

19:21.323 --> 19:22.486
- Okay.
- Done.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.698
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

19:27.163 --> 19:29.202
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

19:29.415 --> 19:32.120
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

19:32.418 --> 19:35.039
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

19:35.588 --> 19:37.664
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

19:37.882 --> 19:40.005
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

19:40.217 --> 19:43.467
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

19:44.096 --> 19:47.679
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

19:48.059 --> 19:51.225
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

19:51.395 --> 19:53.139
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

19:53.773 --> 19:56.690
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

19:56.942 --> 19:59.018
Let me point out just two items:

19:59.361 --> 20:03.359
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

20:03.532 --> 20:07.447
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

20:07.661 --> 20:09.950
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

20:10.164 --> 20:12.453
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.742
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

20:14.919 --> 20:17.125
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

20:17.338 --> 20:19.081
I have my orders.

20:19.882 --> 20:21.709
I see. Gestapo spank.

20:21.926 --> 20:24.713
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

20:24.929 --> 20:28.262
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

20:28.474 --> 20:30.550
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

20:30.726 --> 20:32.885
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

20:33.062 --> 20:35.268
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

20:45.074 --> 20:48.277
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

20:48.494 --> 20:50.368
I have already given him the best...

20:50.496 --> 20:53.069
...knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

20:55.251 --> 20:57.327
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

20:57.461 --> 20:59.335
Yes, sir.

21:02.842 --> 21:05.380
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.425
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

21:13.602 --> 21:15.595
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

21:16.689 --> 21:20.437
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

21:20.609 --> 21:23.314
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

21:23.446 --> 21:26.150
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir.

21:26.449 --> 21:29.652
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

21:29.869 --> 21:33.451
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

21:33.622 --> 21:35.165
I expected no less, captain.

21:35.416 --> 21:36.958
Monsieur Ugarte.

21:37.585 --> 21:39.827
Oh. Yes?

21:40.004 --> 21:42.376
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

21:43.758 --> 21:45.631
May I first please cash my chips?

21:46.260 --> 21:48.502
<i>Dealer Speaking in French</i>

21:52.725 --> 21:55.394

22:02.610 --> 22:04.567
Thank you.

22:14.497 --> 22:16.785

22:17.291 --> 22:19.200

22:19.460 --> 22:23.505
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

22:31.180 --> 22:32.508
Excellent, captain.

22:32.681 --> 22:35.351
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

22:35.518 --> 22:37.594
I stick my neck out for nobody.

22:37.853 --> 22:41.637
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

22:41.857 --> 22:44.858
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

22:44.985 --> 22:46.444
Okay, boss.

<i>Band Playing</i>

22:51.492 --> 22:52.903
Rick.

22:53.202 --> 22:56.653
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

22:56.831 --> 22:58.704
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

22:58.874 --> 23:01.033
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

23:01.210 --> 23:03.701
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

23:07.299 --> 23:08.877
We are very honored tonight.

23:09.051 --> 23:13.215
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

23:13.389 --> 23:16.343
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

23:16.559 --> 23:19.132
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

23:20.271 --> 23:22.347
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

23:22.565 --> 23:25.103
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

23:25.276 --> 23:27.897
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

23:29.488 --> 23:31.528
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

23:31.824 --> 23:34.362
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

23:34.910 --> 23:38.077
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

23:38.247 --> 23:39.990
There seems to be no secret about that.

23:40.207 --> 23:41.666
Are you one of those people...

23:41.792 --> 23:44.627
...who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

23:44.754 --> 23:46.746
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

23:46.964 --> 23:48.838
Can you imagine us in London?

23:49.967 --> 23:51.461
When you get there, ask me.

23:51.927 --> 23:53.090
Diplomatist.

23:53.262 --> 23:54.425
How about New York?

23:54.597 --> 23:56.922
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

23:57.058 --> 23:58.884
...that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

23:59.018 --> 24:00.097
Uh-huh.

24:00.227 --> 24:02.897
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

24:03.064 --> 24:05.352
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

24:05.483 --> 24:07.724
And that takes in the field
of women too.

24:07.943 --> 24:10.150
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

24:10.279 --> 24:12.188
We have a complete dossier on you.

24:13.949 --> 24:18.196
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

24:18.954 --> 24:21.955
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

24:22.124 --> 24:23.749
And also we know why you left Paris.

24:23.876 --> 24:25.869
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

24:26.045 --> 24:27.290
Are my eyes really brown?

24:27.463 --> 24:30.666
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

24:30.841 --> 24:33.083
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

24:33.260 --> 24:36.261
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

24:36.472 --> 24:40.470
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

24:41.310 --> 24:44.430
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

24:44.647 --> 24:48.098
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

24:48.359 --> 24:51.276
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

24:51.445 --> 24:53.023
...until the day we marched in.

24:53.197 --> 24:57.526
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

24:57.743 --> 25:00.413
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

25:00.830 --> 25:03.831
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

25:03.999 --> 25:07.914
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

25:08.087 --> 25:11.538
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

25:11.757 --> 25:13.584
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

25:14.260 --> 25:16.751
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

25:17.471 --> 25:18.503
Perhaps.

25:22.351 --> 25:23.549
Yes, monsieur?

25:23.728 --> 25:27.595
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

25:54.759 --> 25:56.502
Two Cointreaux, please.

25:58.596 --> 26:01.003
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

26:01.265 --> 26:04.301
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

26:04.477 --> 26:07.394
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

26:07.563 --> 26:10.766
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

26:11.567 --> 26:14.319
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

26:14.445 --> 26:15.476
Well?

26:15.696 --> 26:19.990
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

26:20.201 --> 26:22.692
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

26:22.912 --> 26:24.370
The ring is quite unique.

26:26.499 --> 26:30.164
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

26:30.711 --> 26:31.742
What is your name?

26:31.962 --> 26:34.251
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

26:34.590 --> 26:35.621
Victor.

26:35.841 --> 26:38.000
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

26:38.219 --> 26:40.757
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

26:40.930 --> 26:43.088
Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

26:43.224 --> 26:44.932
I'm sorry, it is.

26:46.811 --> 26:48.934
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

26:49.146 --> 26:51.139
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

26:51.315 --> 26:52.478
Yes, what is it you want?

26:52.691 --> 26:55.776
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

26:55.986 --> 26:58.691
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

26:58.906 --> 27:01.314
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

27:01.534 --> 27:05.033
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

27:05.246 --> 27:07.119
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

27:08.874 --> 27:11.792
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

27:11.961 --> 27:13.752
That was a gross understatement.

27:14.213 --> 27:15.244
You're very kind.

27:15.464 --> 27:17.955
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

27:18.342 --> 27:21.462
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

27:21.595 --> 27:24.466
- Captain, please.
- It's a game we play.

27:24.598 --> 27:27.683
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

27:28.561 --> 27:31.348
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

27:32.022 --> 27:33.481
Somewhere I've seen him.

27:33.691 --> 27:35.233
- Sam?
- Yes.

27:35.401 --> 27:37.144
He came from Paris with Rick.

27:37.319 --> 27:38.778
Rick? Who is he?

27:38.946 --> 27:41.567
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is...

27:41.699 --> 27:43.276
- Is what?
- Mademoiselle...

27:43.409 --> 27:46.078
...he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

27:46.203 --> 27:48.694
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

27:48.914 --> 27:52.449
But what a fool I am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

27:53.878 --> 27:54.909
Excuse me.

27:55.087 --> 27:56.914
Major.

27:58.466 --> 28:01.585
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

28:01.761 --> 28:02.792
How do you do?

28:02.970 --> 28:04.963
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

28:05.181 --> 28:07.672
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

28:07.850 --> 28:10.008
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

28:10.269 --> 28:14.314
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you are a subject of the German Reich.

28:15.483 --> 28:18.934
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

28:19.153 --> 28:22.901
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

28:23.074 --> 28:24.698
This is hardly the time or place.

28:24.909 --> 28:27.115
Then we shall state
another time and place.

28:27.244 --> 28:29.320
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

28:29.538 --> 28:30.736
With mademoiselle.

28:32.375 --> 28:35.459
Captain, I am under your authority.

28:35.628 --> 28:37.704
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

28:37.880 --> 28:41.747
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

28:41.967 --> 28:43.794
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.

28:43.928 --> 28:45.885
Mademoiselle.

28:47.431 --> 28:50.516
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

28:50.935 --> 28:54.767
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

28:55.189 --> 28:57.858

haven't we?

29:33.269 --> 29:36.472
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

29:54.331 --> 29:56.573
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

29:56.709 --> 29:57.740
- Yes.
- Monsieur?

29:57.877 --> 29:59.157

30:00.004 --> 30:02.756
I recognize you from the news

one is apt to lose a little weight.

30:06.052 --> 30:09.052
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

30:09.263 --> 30:12.098
As you see,
it was true every single time.

30:12.308 --> 30:13.802
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

30:13.976 --> 30:17.511
I'm looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

30:18.189 --> 30:20.477
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

30:20.649 --> 30:24.861
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

30:25.488 --> 30:26.602
I see.

30:27.114 --> 30:31.159
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

30:36.916 --> 30:38.114

30:38.250 --> 30:39.910
Monsieur.

30:52.056 --> 30:54.381
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

30:54.558 --> 30:56.681
Very well, mademoiselle.

30:58.854 --> 31:02.188
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

31:02.358 --> 31:03.935
Too bad you weren't here earlier.

31:04.068 --> 31:06.523
We had quite a bit of excitement,
didn't we, Berger?

31:06.779 --> 31:08.238
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

31:19.041 --> 31:21.532

31:22.044 --> 31:23.836

- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

31:50.614 --> 31:52.358

- Oh, he never...

33:45.855 --> 33:48.143
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

33:48.357 --> 33:51.856
Oh, you've already met Rick,

33:52.027 --> 33:53.356
This is Mr. Laszlo.

33:53.571 --> 33:54.946
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

33:55.364 --> 33:57.404
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

33:57.783 --> 33:59.575

33:59.785 --> 34:01.908
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

34:02.079 --> 34:03.953
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

34:04.123 --> 34:07.040
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

34:11.547 --> 34:13.041
- What for?
- Your work.

34:13.215 --> 34:14.922
Thank you. I try.

34:15.842 --> 34:17.717
We all try. You succeed.

34:17.969 --> 34:20.259
She was asking about you earlier, Rick...

34:20.389 --> 34:22.797
...in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

34:23.684 --> 34:25.226
I wasn't sure you were the same.

34:25.936 --> 34:28.806
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

34:30.399 --> 34:32.308
How nice. You remembered.

34:32.485 --> 34:35.272
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

34:35.487 --> 34:38.239
- Not an easy day to forget.
- No.

34:38.407 --> 34:42.156
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

34:43.579 --> 34:46.152
Yes. I put that dress away.

34:46.373 --> 34:48.699
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

34:48.918 --> 34:52.998
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

34:53.422 --> 34:56.625
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

34:56.842 --> 34:59.547
So it is.
We have a curfew in Casablanca.

34:59.678 --> 35:03.094
It would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours.

35:03.391 --> 35:05.051
I hope we didn't
overstay our welcome.

35:05.184 --> 35:06.215
Not at all.

35:06.519 --> 35:08.096
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

This has been a very interesting evening.

35:12.108 --> 35:16.022

- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

35:21.158 --> 35:25.203
There's still nobody in the world who
can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

35:25.746 --> 35:28.202

35:47.476 --> 35:50.014

- We'll be there.

36:43.574 --> 36:44.605

We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

Let's see.

44:11.439 --> 44:15.306
Yes, I was having a brace put
on my teeth. Where were you?

44:15.985 --> 44:17.479
Looking for a job.

44:19.530 --> 44:21.404
<i>Rumbling</i>

44:24.160 --> 44:25.702
Was that cannon fire?

44:26.704 --> 44:28.115
Or is it my heart pounding?

44:28.330 --> 44:32.375
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

44:34.670 --> 44:36.829
And getting closer every minute.

44:38.007 --> 44:39.169
Here, here, drink up.

44:40.009 --> 44:41.717
We'll never finish the other three.

44:41.927 --> 44:45.343
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

44:45.514 --> 44:47.673
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

44:47.850 --> 44:50.851
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

44:51.353 --> 44:52.682
It's strange.

44:53.397 --> 44:57.265
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

44:57.443 --> 44:59.815
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

45:01.113 --> 45:03.984
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.314
No, we must leave.

45:06.243 --> 45:07.702
Yes, of course. We.

45:07.912 --> 45:11.530
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

45:11.665 --> 45:14.869
No, no. Not at my hotel. I...

45:15.920 --> 45:18.625
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

45:19.215 --> 45:20.875
I'll meet you at the station.

45:21.133 --> 45:23.256
All right, at a quarter to 5.

45:23.511 --> 45:25.337
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

45:28.808 --> 45:29.839
<i>Stammers</i>

45:30.017 --> 45:31.725
That's too far ahead to plan.

45:31.894 --> 45:33.685
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

45:34.980 --> 45:37.816
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

45:37.942 --> 45:38.973
Oh, darling...

45:39.110 --> 45:42.728
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

45:43.406 --> 45:44.864
Hey...

45:45.032 --> 45:46.147
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

45:52.707 --> 45:54.414
I love you so much.

45:57.086 --> 45:59.577
And I hate this war so much.

46:01.507 --> 46:04.259
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

46:05.886 --> 46:07.844
If you shouldn't get away...

46:08.013 --> 46:09.389
I mean if...

46:09.598 --> 46:11.924
If something should keep us apart...

46:12.852 --> 46:14.761
...wherever they put you...

46:14.937 --> 46:18.187
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

46:20.443 --> 46:22.601
<i>Rumbling</i>

46:23.779 --> 46:25.024
Kiss me.

46:25.448 --> 46:28.365
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

46:32.997 --> 46:35.832
<i>Yelling in French</i>

46:53.350 --> 46:57.099
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

47:04.361 --> 47:05.820
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

47:05.988 --> 47:08.526
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

47:08.741 --> 47:10.817
But this note came just after you left.

47:24.298 --> 47:25.792
<i>Whistle Blows</i>

47:25.966 --> 47:27.674
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

47:28.427 --> 47:29.921
Do you hear me?

47:30.638 --> 47:33.555
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

47:40.523 --> 47:42.848
<i>Train Whistle Blows</i>

47:56.455 --> 47:58.697
<i>Piano Stops</i>

48:25.234 --> 48:28.105
- Rick, I have to talk to you.
- Uh-huh.

48:28.404 --> 48:31.737
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

48:32.408 --> 48:35.029
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

48:36.495 --> 48:40.030
Why did you have to come to
Casablanca? There are other places.

48:40.249 --> 48:42.574
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

48:43.335 --> 48:45.293
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

48:45.463 --> 48:48.879
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

48:49.050 --> 48:51.126
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

48:51.594 --> 48:54.963
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

48:55.890 --> 48:57.681
I can understand how you feel.

48:58.559 --> 49:00.682
You understand how I feel.

49:01.437 --> 49:03.145
How long was it we had, honey?

49:04.106 --> 49:06.265
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

49:06.609 --> 49:08.020
Every one of them.

49:08.694 --> 49:10.603
Mostly I remember the last one.

49:11.614 --> 49:15.362
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

49:15.534 --> 49:17.278
...with a comical look on his face...

49:17.453 --> 49:19.446
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

49:21.457 --> 49:23.615
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

49:23.793 --> 49:26.284
Does it got a wild finish?

49:26.462 --> 49:28.620
I don't know the finish yet.

49:28.798 --> 49:32.214
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

49:34.678 --> 49:38.462
It's about a girl who had just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

49:38.641 --> 49:40.349
At the house of some friends...

49:40.518 --> 49:43.388
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

49:43.562 --> 49:46.766
A very great and courageous man.

49:47.149 --> 49:49.438
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

49:49.610 --> 49:52.183
...full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals.

49:52.613 --> 49:56.480
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

49:56.659 --> 49:58.402
And she looked up to him...

49:58.661 --> 50:00.155
...and worshiped him...

50:00.329 --> 50:03.164
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

50:03.332 --> 50:05.455
Yes, that's very pretty.

50:05.626 --> 50:09.327
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

50:09.505 --> 50:12.292
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

50:12.466 --> 50:14.792
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

50:15.261 --> 50:20.302
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

50:22.601 --> 50:26.350
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

50:26.522 --> 50:27.637
Tell me...

50:28.566 --> 50:30.689
...who was it you left me for?

50:30.860 --> 50:33.695
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

50:34.405 --> 50:36.730
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

50:50.546 --> 50:52.373
<i>Door Closes</i>

51:02.058 --> 51:05.640
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

51:05.811 --> 51:08.183
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

51:08.355 --> 51:11.392
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

51:11.650 --> 51:13.690
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

51:13.861 --> 51:16.434
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

51:16.614 --> 51:18.690
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

51:18.866 --> 51:22.780
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

51:22.953 --> 51:25.871
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

51:26.040 --> 51:29.872
It may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

51:34.924 --> 51:37.593
There is nothing we can do.

51:38.594 --> 51:41.263
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

51:41.389 --> 51:42.420
I slept very well.

51:42.598 --> 51:45.219
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

51:46.477 --> 51:48.802
- May we proceed?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

51:48.938 --> 51:50.847
Thank you.

51:52.566 --> 51:55.935
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

51:56.112 --> 51:58.437
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

51:58.906 --> 52:00.448
You have reached Casablanca.

52:00.658 --> 52:03.363
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

52:03.619 --> 52:05.695
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

52:05.871 --> 52:08.623
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

52:08.791 --> 52:11.496
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

52:11.669 --> 52:13.994
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

52:14.255 --> 52:16.294
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

52:16.882 --> 52:18.590
And mademoiselle?

52:18.759 --> 52:22.294
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

52:22.471 --> 52:25.389
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

52:25.558 --> 52:28.227
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

52:28.394 --> 52:30.303
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

52:30.479 --> 52:32.686
- On one condition.
- And that is?

52:32.982 --> 52:36.148
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

52:36.360 --> 52:37.689
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

52:37.903 --> 52:40.145
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

52:40.364 --> 52:42.938
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

52:43.117 --> 52:45.738
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

52:45.911 --> 52:47.655
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

52:47.955 --> 52:50.624
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

52:51.333 --> 52:53.492
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

52:54.003 --> 52:57.454
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

52:59.008 --> 53:01.499
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

53:01.719 --> 53:04.636
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

53:04.847 --> 53:07.420
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

53:07.892 --> 53:10.264
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

53:10.478 --> 53:12.020
What if you murdered all of us?

53:12.188 --> 53:16.517
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

53:16.692 --> 53:19.017
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

53:19.195 --> 53:22.729
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

53:22.907 --> 53:24.531
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

53:24.700 --> 53:27.238
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

53:27.411 --> 53:28.953
But there is one exception.

53:29.163 --> 53:31.736
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

53:31.916 --> 53:34.833
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

53:35.211 --> 53:37.536
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

53:37.713 --> 53:39.255
This is still unoccupied France.

53:39.715 --> 53:42.550
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

53:42.718 --> 53:45.423
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

53:45.596 --> 53:49.724
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

53:50.142 --> 53:54.222
- Yes?
- I believe you have a message for him?

53:54.397 --> 53:56.638
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

53:57.191 --> 54:00.227
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

54:00.403 --> 54:02.229
Signor Ugarte is dead.

54:08.869 --> 54:10.364
I'm making out the report now.

54:10.538 --> 54:13.111
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

54:13.791 --> 54:15.665
...or died trying to escape.

54:17.294 --> 54:19.999
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

54:20.214 --> 54:21.708
Good day.

54:26.095 --> 54:28.764
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

54:28.889 --> 54:29.921
Excuse me, captain.

54:30.141 --> 54:33.142
Another visa problem has come up.

54:33.602 --> 54:36.520
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

54:45.197 --> 54:48.234
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

54:48.409 --> 54:51.161
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

54:51.328 --> 54:53.535
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

54:53.706 --> 54:56.327
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

54:56.542 --> 54:58.618
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

54:59.295 --> 55:00.955
Thanks.

55:12.808 --> 55:14.184
Don't be too downhearted.

55:14.393 --> 55:16.469
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

55:16.645 --> 55:17.974
Thank you very much, signor.

55:18.147 --> 55:20.555
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

55:20.733 --> 55:22.891
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

55:23.110 --> 55:25.150
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

55:25.321 --> 55:26.649
I never drink in the morning.

55:26.781 --> 55:29.532
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

55:29.700 --> 55:31.657
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

55:31.827 --> 55:33.156
Here, sit down.

55:33.329 --> 55:35.998
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

55:36.165 --> 55:37.790
Bourbon.

55:38.042 --> 55:39.999
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

55:40.169 --> 55:43.336
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

55:43.756 --> 55:46.543
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

55:46.717 --> 55:48.757
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

55:48.928 --> 55:50.208
Practically no one.

55:50.429 --> 55:52.671
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

55:52.973 --> 55:55.013
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

55:55.226 --> 55:57.551
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

55:57.686 --> 55:59.264
I'll handle the entire transaction.

55:59.397 --> 56:02.101
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

56:02.316 --> 56:03.810
And the carrying charges?

56:03.984 --> 56:06.736
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

56:07.446 --> 56:09.854
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

56:10.032 --> 56:11.574
I'll tell him when he comes in.

56:11.742 --> 56:14.364
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

56:14.662 --> 56:17.865
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

56:23.546 --> 56:26.582
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

56:26.757 --> 56:30.091
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

56:30.261 --> 56:32.218
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

56:35.808 --> 56:36.839
Morning.

56:36.976 --> 56:39.549
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

56:44.233 --> 56:46.854
You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

56:47.069 --> 56:48.350
Only 700 francs.

56:48.571 --> 56:51.737
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

56:51.907 --> 56:55.027
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

56:55.244 --> 56:57.735
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

56:57.913 --> 57:01.579
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

57:01.709 --> 57:02.740
Doesn't matter.

57:02.918 --> 57:06.868
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

57:07.048 --> 57:10.084
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

57:10.259 --> 57:11.884
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

57:12.053 --> 57:14.757
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

57:14.930 --> 57:18.549
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

57:18.726 --> 57:19.757
Yes.

57:19.935 --> 57:22.261
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

57:22.521 --> 57:24.063
I don't think I will, Rick.

57:24.231 --> 57:26.805
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

57:26.942 --> 57:28.520
I think I'm entitled to know.

57:28.694 --> 57:30.901
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

57:31.572 --> 57:34.775
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

57:34.950 --> 57:37.524
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

57:39.080 --> 57:42.116
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

57:43.250 --> 57:47.295
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

57:47.463 --> 57:48.791
If we leave it that way...

57:48.923 --> 57:52.292
...maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

57:52.760 --> 57:53.875
Not last night.

57:54.553 --> 57:57.803
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

57:57.973 --> 58:00.844
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

58:01.018 --> 58:02.726
You can believe that if you want to.

58:02.937 --> 58:05.642
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

58:05.815 --> 58:07.641
Above a saloon, it's true...

58:07.817 --> 58:09.275
...but walk up a flight...

58:09.443 --> 58:11.151
...I'll be expecting you.

58:13.239 --> 58:16.026
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.943
You'll be there.

58:19.453 --> 58:20.484
No, Rick.

58:21.914 --> 58:24.156
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

58:25.209 --> 58:28.792
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

58:33.342 --> 58:37.921
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

58:38.097 --> 58:40.006
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

58:40.182 --> 58:42.969
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

58:43.102 --> 58:44.762
...I am influential and respected.

58:44.937 --> 58:48.353
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

58:48.524 --> 58:50.351
You, however, are a different matter.

58:50.818 --> 58:55.195
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

58:55.614 --> 58:58.734
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

58:58.951 --> 59:02.201
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

59:02.371 --> 59:04.198
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

59:04.373 --> 59:07.825
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

59:08.294 --> 59:10.417
We are only interested in two visas.

59:10.588 --> 59:12.876
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

59:13.215 --> 59:15.291
You two will want to discuss this.

59:15.468 --> 59:17.425
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

59:21.307 --> 59:23.098
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

59:23.267 --> 59:26.636
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

59:26.896 --> 59:28.687
But if the situation were different...

59:28.856 --> 59:31.394
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

59:31.567 --> 59:32.895
...would you take it?

59:34.070 --> 59:35.184
Yes, I would.

59:36.405 --> 59:37.568
Yes, I see.

59:38.741 --> 59:42.655
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

59:42.828 --> 59:45.035
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

59:45.164 --> 59:48.865
...and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

59:50.169 --> 59:52.660
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

59:55.132 --> 59:56.591
I love you very much, Ilsa.

59:57.802 --> 59:59.925
Your secret will be safe with me.

01:00:00.971 --> 01:00:03.094
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:05.591
Not more than 50 francs.

01:00:10.314 --> 01:00:12.105
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

01:00:12.274 --> 01:00:15.643
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.777
Well, good luck, but be careful.

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:20.782
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:24.153
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.075
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

01:00:27.248 --> 01:00:29.121
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:32.500
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:33.659
Yes, something.

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:37.041
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:39.209
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:42.463
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:44.170
Rick?

01:00:44.348 --> 01:00:47.551
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

01:00:47.768 --> 01:00:49.393
But it is worth a chance.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:52.766
Thank you very much.
Good day.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.224
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:57.233
I shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

01:00:57.361 --> 01:00:59.733
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

01:00:59.905 --> 01:01:02.313
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

- Good luck.

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:15.705
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:19.670
I have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.167
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:24.509
- Goodbye.
- It has been a pleasure to meet you.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.340
I'm sorry.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:45.863
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best customer.

01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:50.284
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:52.365
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:54.867
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.036
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.501
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

01:01:59.673 --> 01:02:01.796
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

01:02:01.967 --> 01:02:03.877
You know how
that impresses Germans.

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.546
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.013
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:15.103
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

01:02:15.272 --> 01:02:17.894
- It looks like you're a little late.
- Huh?

01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:26.859
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:30.783
Who knows? In her own way, she
may constitute an entire second front.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:34.704
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:36.953
Sascha!

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.159
French 75's.

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:42.044
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

01:02:42.216 --> 01:02:43.544
We will begin with two.

Would you kindly repeat it?

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.389
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:08.237
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

01:03:12.621 --> 01:03:14.164
You see, captain?

01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:16.787
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:18.875
We try to cooperate
with your government.

01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:21.328
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

01:03:21.505 --> 01:03:23.664
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.125
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

01:03:26.343 --> 01:03:27.624
I blow with the wind...

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:30.211
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:32.139
And if it should change?

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:34.550
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:36.803
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:40.437
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

01:03:40.941 --> 01:03:43.646
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

01:03:43.819 --> 01:03:45.064
A leader? Like Laszlo?

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.319
Mm-hm. I have been thinking.

01:03:47.656 --> 01:03:50.990
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.951
I see what you mean.

- No, of course not. You mind if I do?
- Oh, no.

...is he trustworthy?
Is his word..?

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:24.701
Just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?

01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:26.296
He did. Captain Renault did.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:28.540

- Eight weeks.

We do not want our children

- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.989
But we haven't much money...

01:05:57.161 --> 01:05:59.617
...and traveling is so expensive

to get here.

- Yes.

- And you want to know..?
- Will he keep his word?

...so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world...

...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:48.207
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:41.549
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.551
Right this way, if you please.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:47.474
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.975
Thank you.

Marquons les jeux, mesdames et

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.935
No. No, I guess not.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.978
Have you tried 22 tonight?

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:33.942
I said 22.

Cash it in and don't come back.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.264
Are you sure this place is honest?

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:17.648
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

01:09:20.613 --> 01:09:21.943
How are we doing tonight?

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.952
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:30.621
Monsieur Rick...

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.163
I... Oh...

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.296
He's just a lucky guy.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.879
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:45.130
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

01:09:48.642 --> 01:09:50.136
Captain Renault, may I..?

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.683
Not here.
Come to my office in the morning.

01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:54.521
We'll do everything businesslike.

01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:57.186
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.186
I'm very happy for both of you.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.484
Still, it's very strange that you won.

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:03.897
Well, maybe not so strange.

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.910
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:08.905
No!

Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.705
Go away, you crazy Russian.

01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:33.602
As I suspected.
You're a rank sentimentalist.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:34.808
Yeah? Why?

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:36.812
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:38.851
Put it down as a gesture to love.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.568
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.571
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.946
And it'll make me very happy
if she loses.

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:48.159
Mm-hm.

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:52.326
Mr. Blaine,
I wonder if I could talk to you.

01:10:52.456 --> 01:10:54.947
- Go ahead.
- Well, isn't there some other place?

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:57.658
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.872
- In my office.
- Right.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:05.594
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.762
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.722
You know what I've been doing.

01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:14.806
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:17.268
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.850
I'm not interested in politics.

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:21.516
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:22.892
I'm a saloonkeeper.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:26.772
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.491
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:30.367
You fought against
the fascists in Spain.

01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:31.526
What of it?

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.871
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:36.991
Yes, I found that
a very expensive hobby.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.451
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:42.962
Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:46.003
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.923
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.929
My answer would still be the same.

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.257
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:54.590
There is.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.183
I suggest that you ask your wife.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.149
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.890
- My wife?
- Yes.

a café can inspire this demonstration...

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:07.980
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.145
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:13.400
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:14.772
The place is to be closed.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.987
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

This café is closed until further notice.

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:28.832
Clear the room at once.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.630
How can you close me up?

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:37.296
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.382
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:40.803
Everybody out at once.

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:49.187
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.147
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:55.275
That is also true, except for one
destination: Occupied France.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.362
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:14:59.609
Of what value is that?

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:02.823
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:06.249
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.411
The French authorities
may find a reason...

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:10.704
...to put him
in the concentration camp here.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:11.996
The other alternative?

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.500
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed...

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:16.924
...that in Casablanca
human life is cheap.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.424
Good night, mademoiselle.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:32.649
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.544
Our faithful friend is still there.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:00.633
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:01.969
I must.

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:05.592
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:09.103
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:11.142
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.724
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:15.569
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:18.657
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.451
Victor, why don't you tell me
about Rick? What did you find out?

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.992
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:26.742
But no intention of selling them.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:30.581
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:32.331
Did he give any reason?

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:35.796
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:38.167
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:40.928
I don't know why he said that.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:56.194
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:59.398
I'll be going in a few minutes.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.941
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.488
When I was in the concentration camp...

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:10.620
...were you lonely in Paris?

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.079
Yes, Victor, I was.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:18.001
I know how it is to be lonely.

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:21.418
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:25.423
No, Victor, there isn't.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.600
I love you very much, my dear.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:35.435
Yes.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.936
Yes, I know.

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.187
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I..?

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:44.070
You don't even have to say it.

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:45.986
I'll believe.

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:49.450
Good night, dear.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:52.787
Good night.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:02.511
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:09.184
Be careful.

01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.347
Of course I'll be careful.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:58.893
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.859
How long can I afford to stay closed?

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:02.809
Two weeks, maybe three.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.237
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:07.691
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.244
Thank you, Herr Rick.

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:12.745
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:16.167
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:19.455
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:20.828
I won't.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.087
Good night.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:25.796
Good night, Mr. Rick.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:45.860
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:49.365
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:50.780
Well, won't you sit down?

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:54.867
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:58.326
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:01.249
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.043
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:06.790
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:09.088
I know how you feel about me...

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:12.015
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:14.638
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.803
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:18.308
It was your cause too.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.978
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:24.147
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:26.354
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:32.732
Richard.

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:36.488
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you...

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.583
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:43.203
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:45.457
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

01:20:45.633 --> 01:20:48.669
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.642
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:58.561
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.433
One woman has hurt you...

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.316
...and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:06.022
You're a coward and a weakling.

01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:12.277
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.323
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:19.202
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:20.406
What of it?

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:23.254
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:31.921
Now, if you'll...

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:35.587
All right.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.806
I tried to reason with you.

01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:40.219
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:43.724
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:47.191
Put them on the table.

01:21:49.029 --> 01:21:50.061
No.

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:53.274
For the last time,
put them on the table.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:58.574
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:01.991
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:08.120
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:14.927
Richard...

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:17.469
...I tried to stay away.

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:20.519
I thought I would never see you again.

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:24.101
That you were out of my life.

01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:46.416
The day you left Paris...

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.956
...if you knew what I went through.

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:54.303
If you knew how much I loved you.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:58.139
How much I still love you.

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:13.060
And then?

01:23:15.116 --> 01:23:19.445
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.155
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.040
Just a two-line item in the paper:

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.830
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.330
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:32.830
Then it came.

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.209
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:39.003
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

01:23:40.433 --> 01:23:41.843
Then I met you.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:45.518
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:48.814
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.516
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

01:23:51.986 --> 01:23:54.940
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:58.441
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:00.160
...and for those working with us.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:03.111
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:06.703
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:09.283
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:12.581
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:14.916
He was sick. He needed me.

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:19.132
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

01:24:19.305 --> 01:24:23.255
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.053
Well...

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.055
...well, you know the rest.

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:34.061
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:35.399
What about now?

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:37.603
Now?

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:39.949
I don't know.

01:24:40.618 --> 01:24:43.654
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

01:24:44.872 --> 01:24:45.903
And Laszlo?

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:49.540
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:53.044
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

01:24:53.214 --> 01:24:54.708
All except one.

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:57.586
He won't have you.

01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:01.505
I can't fight it anymore.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:05.591
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:11.640
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:13.892
You have to think for both of us.

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:16.277
For all of us.

01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:22.576
All right. I will.

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.413
Here's looking at you, kid.

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:33.293
I wish I didn't love you so much.

01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:47.759
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:49.928
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.093
Come inside.

01:25:55.401 --> 01:26:00.277
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:02.281
hank you.

01:26:19.717 --> 01:26:21.875
Carl, what happened?

01:26:22.053 --> 01:26:24.092
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:25.680
We escaped at the last moment.

01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:28.178
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:31.684
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:34.559
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

01:26:35.274 --> 01:26:37.516
Yes, I come. I will do it.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:48.700
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:59.673 --> 01:27:02.793
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:04.712
This might come in handy.

01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:06.043
Thank you.

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:08.885
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:13.645
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

01:27:13.813 --> 01:27:15.722
I mean, what you're fighting for.

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:18.855
We might as well question
why we breathe.

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:20.568
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:23.192
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

01:27:23.364 --> 01:27:25.606
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

01:27:25.783 --> 01:27:27.941
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

01:27:28.119 --> 01:27:30.360
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

01:27:30.496 --> 01:27:32.785
...of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:36.082
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:39.123
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:42.583
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:44.336
...and that you'll never succeed.

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.752
You seem to know all about my destiny.

01:27:48.556 --> 01:27:51.129
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:53.723
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

01:27:53.936 --> 01:27:55.679
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

01:27:55.855 --> 01:27:58.772
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:01.099
The first evening I came into this café...

01:28:01.277 --> 01:28:03.602
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

01:28:04.447 --> 01:28:06.107
Since no one is to blame...

01:28:06.532 --> 01:28:08.525
...I demand no explanation.

01:28:08.701 --> 01:28:11.986
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

01:28:12.163 --> 01:28:13.740
All right.

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.824
But I want my wife to be safe.

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:17.536
I ask you as a favor...

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:20.627
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:21.911
You love her that much?

01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:24.883
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:28.047
Well, I am also a human being.

01:28:28.888 --> 01:28:30.382
Yes, I love her that much.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.015
<i>Clattering</i>

01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:39.469
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:42.186
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

01:28:42.318 --> 01:28:43.349
On what charge?

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:45.734
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

01:28:45.905 --> 01:28:48.656
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:04.583
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:07.082
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

01:29:07.218 --> 01:29:08.842
You might as well let him go now.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:12.012
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

01:29:12.181 --> 01:29:13.675
If you were to help him escape...

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:16.257
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.891
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:22.183
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

01:29:22.358 --> 01:29:25.442
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:27.485
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

01:29:27.655 --> 01:29:29.030
They're all excellent reasons.

01:29:29.198 --> 01:29:31.155
Don't count too much on my friendship.

01:29:31.325 --> 01:29:34.776
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

01:29:35.121 --> 01:29:39.699
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:41.370
Yes, I have the letters.

01:29:41.544 --> 01:29:43.371
But I intend using them myself.

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:47.289
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:50.551
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.677
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

01:29:52.847 --> 01:29:56.429
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.640
The last man I want to see in America.

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:02.061
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

01:30:02.231 --> 01:30:05.398
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

01:30:05.568 --> 01:30:08.237
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

01:30:08.404 --> 01:30:12.615
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

01:30:12.867 --> 01:30:14.824
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

01:30:14.994 --> 01:30:17.117
...but people have been held
in Casablanca...

01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:18.906
...in spite of their legal rights.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.913
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

01:30:21.042 --> 01:30:22.073
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:24.920
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:26.629
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:30.332
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

01:30:30.509 --> 01:30:33.759
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:36.551
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

01:30:36.724 --> 01:30:38.882
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.091
Then release him.

01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:42.938
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

01:30:43.105 --> 01:30:45.596
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

01:30:45.816 --> 01:30:48.438
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

01:30:48.694 --> 01:30:50.983
You get him, and we get away.

01:30:51.155 --> 01:30:54.072
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

01:30:54.283 --> 01:30:57.070
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

01:30:57.286 --> 01:30:59.955
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:02.447
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:05.294
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

01:31:05.878 --> 01:31:08.286
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

01:31:08.464 --> 01:31:11.299
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

01:31:11.467 --> 01:31:12.712
I'm gonna miss you.

01:31:12.843 --> 01:31:15.963
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than I.

01:31:16.222 --> 01:31:17.467
Oh, thanks.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.219
Go ahead, Ricky.

01:31:19.433 --> 01:31:22.138
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

01:31:22.269 --> 01:31:24.179
I don't want them around this afternoon.

01:31:24.313 --> 01:31:26.306
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:36.479
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

01:31:36.659 --> 01:31:39.909
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

01:31:40.204 --> 01:31:43.538
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

01:31:43.749 --> 01:31:49.170
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

01:31:49.338 --> 01:31:52.125
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

01:31:52.299 --> 01:31:55.253
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

01:31:55.469 --> 01:31:57.877
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

01:31:58.055 --> 01:31:59.384
Well, so long.

01:31:59.557 --> 01:32:02.593
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:05.259
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

01:32:15.114 --> 01:32:16.145
<i>Stepping</i>

01:32:25.499 --> 01:32:27.492
<i>Knocking</i>

01:32:40.097 --> 01:32:41.128
You're late.

01:32:41.265 --> 01:32:44.432
I was informed when Laszlo
left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.

01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:47.638
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

01:32:47.813 --> 01:32:49.889
This place will never be
the same without you.

01:32:50.107 --> 01:32:53.642
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

01:32:53.819 --> 01:32:56.571
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

01:32:56.739 --> 01:32:58.897
When we searched the place,
where were they?

01:32:59.075 --> 01:33:00.237
Sam's piano.

01:33:00.993 --> 01:33:02.902
<i>Serves me right for not being musical.
Tires Squealing</i>

01:33:03.204 --> 01:33:04.235
Here they are.

01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:06.455
You better wait in my office.

01:33:14.673 --> 01:33:16.002
Here.

01:33:16.175 --> 01:33:18.748
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

01:33:18.928 --> 01:33:19.959
Not yet.

01:33:20.096 --> 01:33:21.720
But you were able to
arrange everything?

01:33:21.847 --> 01:33:22.927
Everything is quite all right.

01:33:23.099 --> 01:33:26.099
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:28.095
Please trust me.

01:33:30.147 --> 01:33:31.392
Yes, I will.

01:33:36.612 --> 01:33:40.692
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

01:33:42.493 --> 01:33:45.613
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

01:33:45.996 --> 01:33:47.906
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

01:33:48.082 --> 01:33:51.367
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

01:33:51.544 --> 01:33:53.869
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

01:33:54.046 --> 01:33:56.454
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:58.043
Victor Laszlo.

01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:01.297
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:05.674
The charge of accessory to the murder...

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:07.931
...of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

01:34:08.519 --> 01:34:11.769
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

01:34:11.981 --> 01:34:14.935
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

01:34:15.735 --> 01:34:20.147
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:22.315
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

01:34:22.491 --> 01:34:24.650
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

01:34:24.827 --> 01:34:26.654
...but I will if you take one more step.

01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:29.613
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:36.334
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

01:34:36.505 --> 01:34:38.664
I do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

01:34:38.841 --> 01:34:40.419
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

01:34:40.593 --> 01:34:43.214
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

01:34:43.387 --> 01:34:45.795
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

01:34:45.973 --> 01:34:48.049
That is my least vulnerable spot.

01:34:55.608 --> 01:34:58.562
- Hello? Is that the airport?
- Huh?

01:34:58.986 --> 01:35:00.646
This is Captain Renault speaking.

01:35:00.863 --> 01:35:03.401
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

01:35:03.574 --> 01:35:05.365
There's to be no trouble about them.

01:35:05.785 --> 01:35:06.816
Good.

01:35:07.244 --> 01:35:09.735
Hello? Hello?

01:35:10.998 --> 01:35:12.576
<i>Buzzing</i>

01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:14.622
My car, quickly!

01:35:14.752 --> 01:35:16.163
<i>Speaks in German</i>

01:35:16.587 --> 01:35:17.702
This is Major Strasser.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.336
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

01:35:20.508 --> 01:35:21.788
At once, do you hear?

01:35:28.933 --> 01:35:30.972
Hello, radio tower?

01:35:31.143 --> 01:35:34.228
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

01:35:34.522 --> 01:35:36.977
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:41.064
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

01:35:41.237 --> 01:35:43.988
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

01:35:56.502 --> 01:35:59.254
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

01:35:59.422 --> 01:36:01.165
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

01:36:01.382 --> 01:36:03.540
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

01:36:03.676 --> 01:36:04.755
Yes, sir.

01:36:04.885 --> 01:36:05.917
This way, please.

01:36:07.805 --> 01:36:10.925
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.139
You think of everything, don't you?

01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:15.766
And the names are
Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

01:36:15.938 --> 01:36:19.521
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

01:36:19.692 --> 01:36:21.269
I don't understand.
What about you?

01:36:21.444 --> 01:36:23.567
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

01:36:23.738 --> 01:36:25.730
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

01:36:25.906 --> 01:36:27.698
Last night we said a great many things.

01:36:27.867 --> 01:36:29.776
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

01:36:29.952 --> 01:36:32.621
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

01:36:32.788 --> 01:36:34.781
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

01:36:34.915 --> 01:36:37.453
- Richard, no...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

01:36:37.626 --> 01:36:40.497
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

01:36:40.671 --> 01:36:43.957
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

01:36:44.133 --> 01:36:46.422
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

01:36:46.594 --> 01:36:50.010
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

01:36:50.222 --> 01:36:52.464
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

01:36:52.641 --> 01:36:54.967
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

01:36:55.144 --> 01:36:58.015
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:01.730
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:04.686
But what about us?

01:37:04.862 --> 01:37:06.273
We'll always have Paris.

01:37:06.447 --> 01:37:09.448
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

01:37:09.825 --> 01:37:11.485
We got it back last night.

01:37:12.411 --> 01:37:16.160
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:18.160
But I've got a job to do too.

01:37:18.376 --> 01:37:19.870
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

01:37:20.002 --> 01:37:22.125
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

01:37:22.713 --> 01:37:24.255
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

01:37:24.423 --> 01:37:27.875
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

01:37:28.052 --> 01:37:30.757
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:33.468
Someday you'll understand that.

01:37:34.642 --> 01:37:36.385
Now, now.

01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.345
Here's looking at you, kid.

01:37:49.323 --> 01:37:50.983
<i>Horn Honks</i>

01:37:55.496 --> 01:37:57.987
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

01:37:58.207 --> 01:38:00.365
There's something you should know.

01:38:00.584 --> 01:38:02.376
I don't ask you to explain anything.

01:38:02.545 --> 01:38:05.664
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.713
- You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
- Yes.

01:38:07.883 --> 01:38:10.718
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:14.338
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

01:38:14.765 --> 01:38:16.010
Yes.

01:38:16.183 --> 01:38:18.223
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

01:38:18.394 --> 01:38:21.893
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

01:38:22.064 --> 01:38:24.602
But that was all over long ago.

01:38:24.775 --> 01:38:28.061
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

01:38:28.571 --> 01:38:30.195
I understand.

01:38:30.364 --> 01:38:32.571
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

01:38:33.242 --> 01:38:35.069
I appreciate it.

01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:37.703
Welcome back to the fight.

01:38:37.913 --> 01:38:40.404
This time I know our side will win.

01:38:54.138 --> 01:38:56.296
Are you ready, Ilsa?

01:38:58.184 --> 01:38:59.559
Yes, I'm ready.

01:39:02.688 --> 01:39:04.063
Goodbye, Rick.

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.814
God bless you.

01:39:08.152 --> 01:39:10.857
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

01:39:28.923 --> 01:39:30.832
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

01:39:31.008 --> 01:39:33.843
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:39:34.011 --> 01:39:35.340
What you just did for Laszlo.

01:39:35.513 --> 01:39:37.920
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

01:39:38.099 --> 01:39:40.424
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

01:39:40.643 --> 01:39:42.635
But she knew you were lying.

01:39:42.812 --> 01:39:44.769
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

01:39:44.939 --> 01:39:48.224
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

01:39:48.359 --> 01:39:49.557
Especially for you.

01:39:49.693 --> 01:39:52.897
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

01:39:59.954 --> 01:40:01.863
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

01:40:01.997 --> 01:40:04.286
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

01:40:06.836 --> 01:40:08.959
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

01:40:09.130 --> 01:40:11.169
Ask Monsieur Rick.

01:40:13.467 --> 01:40:16.302
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

01:40:16.512 --> 01:40:19.762
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

01:40:21.726 --> 01:40:23.303
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

01:40:23.477 --> 01:40:25.351
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

01:40:40.369 --> 01:40:41.947
Major Strasser has been shot.

01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:49.378
Round up the usual suspects.

01:40:57.076 --> 01:41:00.204
Allez. Cette voiture.
Vous allez là.

01:41:13.069 --> 01:41:15.227
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

01:41:15.362 --> 01:41:17.022
...but you've become a patriot.

01:41:17.156 --> 01:41:19.362
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

01:41:19.492 --> 01:41:21.484
I think perhaps you're right.

01:41:46.268 --> 01:41:49.969
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

01:41:50.147 --> 01:41:52.603
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

01:41:52.775 --> 01:41:56.559
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

01:41:56.779 --> 01:41:58.024
I could use a trip.

01:41:58.239 --> 01:42:01.489
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

01:42:01.742 --> 01:42:04.613
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

01:42:04.787 --> 01:42:06.696
- "Our" expenses?
- Mm-hm.

01:42:06.872 --> 01:42:11.084
- Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
