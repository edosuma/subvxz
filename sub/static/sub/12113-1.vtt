01:09.499 --> 01:12.172
<i>I am packing my belongings
in the shawl my mother</i>

01:12.185 --> 01:14.493
<i>used to wear when she
went to the market...</i>

01:14.587 --> 01:16.959
<i>and I am going from my valley.</i>

01:17.048 --> 01:19.799
<i>And this time I shall never return.</i>

01:20.843 --> 01:23.963
<i>I am leaving behind me
my 50 years of memory.</i>

01:25.014 --> 01:26.805
<i>Memory.</i>

01:26.891 --> 01:31.268
<i>Strange that the mind will forget so much
of what only this moment is passed...</i>

01:31.353 --> 01:35.303
<i>and yet hold clear and bright the
memory of what happened years ago...</i>

01:35.399 --> 01:37.891
<i>of men and women long since dead.</i>

01:38.820 --> 01:42.022
<i>Yet who shall say what
is real and what is not?</i>

01:42.655 --> 01:45.028
<i>Can I believe my friends all gone...</i>

01:45.117 --> 01:48.402
<i>when their voices are
still a glory in my ears?</i>

01:48.829 --> 01:52.826
<i>No. And I will stand to
say no and no again...</i>

01:52.916 --> 01:56.035
<i>for they remain a living
truth within my mind.</i>

01:56.127 --> 01:59.461
<i>There is no fence nor hedge
around time that is gone.</i>

01:59.548 --> 02:02.964
<i>You can go back and have what you
like of it, if you can remember.</i>

02:03.051 --> 02:06.835
<i>So I can close my eyes on my valley
as it is today and it is gone...</i>

02:06.930 --> 02:10.180
<i>and I see it as it was when I was a boy.</i>

02:10.265 --> 02:13.221
<i>Green it was, and possessed
of the plenty of the earth.</i>

02:13.312 --> 02:16.015
<i>In all Wales, there was none so beautiful.</i>

02:17.314 --> 02:21.609
<i>Everything I ever learnt as a
small boy came from my father...</i>

02:21.694 --> 02:25.906
<i>and I never found anything he ever
told me to be wrong or worthless.</i>

02:25.990 --> 02:29.572
<i>The simple lessons he taught me are
as sharp and clear in my mind...</i>

02:29.660 --> 02:32.198
<i>as if I had heard them only yesterday.</i>

02:34.332 --> 02:39.457
<i>In those days, the black slag,
the waste of the coal pits...</i>

02:39.545 --> 02:43.128
<i>had only begun to cover
the side of our hill...</i>

02:43.215 --> 02:48.458
<i>not yet enough to mar the countryside,
nor blacken the beauty of our village.</i>

02:49.514 --> 02:55.136
<i>For the colliery had only begun to poke its
skinny black fingers through the green.</i>

02:58.564 --> 03:01.849
<i>I can hear even now the voice
of my sister Angharad.</i>

03:02.192 --> 03:02.692
Huw!

03:09.742 --> 03:13.905
Angharad!

03:19.959 --> 03:24.669
<i>Coal miners were my father and all my
brothers, and proud of their trade.</i>

03:24.756 --> 03:28.373
● Gwilym Morgan, three pounds seven.
● Thank you, sir.

03:28.467 --> 03:31.635
Ianto Morgan, three pounds seven.

03:35.266 --> 03:37.674
Ivor Morgan, three pounds seven.

03:37.768 --> 03:40.390
Davy Morgan, two pounds five.

03:42.564 --> 03:44.972
Owen Morgan, two pounds five.

03:45.693 --> 03:49.311
Young Gwilym Morgan, one pound ten.

03:51.032 --> 03:53.107
<i>Someone would strike up a song...</i>

03:53.200 --> 03:56.783
<i>and the valley would ring with
the sound of many voices.</i>

03:56.870 --> 04:00.620
<i>For singing is in my people
as sight is in the eye.</i>

05:30.878 --> 05:33.916
<i>Then came the scrubbing,
out in the back yard.</i>

05:34.508 --> 05:39.965
<i>It was the duty of my sister Angharad to
bring the buckets of hot water and cold...</i>

05:40.056 --> 05:43.091
<i>and I performed what
little tasks I could...</i>

05:43.182 --> 05:47.051
<i>as my father and brothers scrubbed
the coal dust from their backs.</i>

05:47.145 --> 05:50.977
<i>Most would come off them, but
some would stay for life.</i>

05:51.066 --> 05:53.639
<i>It is the honorable badge
of the coal miner...</i>

05:53.735 --> 05:57.317
<i>and I envied it on my father
and grown-up brothers.</i>

05:57.405 --> 06:01.902
<i>Scrub and scrub, Mr. Coal would
lie there and laugh at you.</i>

07:05.763 --> 07:10.971
<i>There was always a baron of beef or a
shoulder or leg of lamb before my father.</i>

07:12.229 --> 07:15.479
<i>There was never any talk
while we were eating.</i>

07:15.565 --> 07:20.143
<i>I never met anybody whose talk
was better than good food.</i>

07:20.236 --> 07:22.442
<i>My mother was always on the run...</i>

07:22.530 --> 07:26.943
<i>always the last to start her
dinner, and the first to finish.</i>

07:27.035 --> 07:31.826
<i>For if my father was the head of our
house, my mother was its heart.</i>

07:33.708 --> 07:37.539
<i>After the dishes had been washed,
the box was brought to the table...</i>

07:37.628 --> 07:40.713
<i>for the spending money to be handed out.</i>

07:40.799 --> 07:43.371
<i>No one in our valley had ever seen a bank.</i>

07:43.467 --> 07:46.587
<i>We kept our savings on the mantelpiece.</i>

07:46.679 --> 07:50.130
<i>My father used to say that
money was made to be spent...</i>

07:50.224 --> 07:54.435
<i>just as men spend their strength
and brains in earning it...</i>

07:54.520 --> 07:56.892
<i>and as willingly.</i>

07:56.980 --> 07:59.471
<i>But always with a purpose.</i>

08:19.085 --> 08:21.373
Thank you, Dadda.

08:25.926 --> 08:30.753
<i>Out of the house and across the street,
as I had run a hundred times before.</i>

08:33.099 --> 08:38.307
<i>Softly now, for respect for chapel was
the first thing my father taught us.</i>

08:41.899 --> 08:44.651
<i>Then straight to Mrs. Tossal the Shop...</i>

08:44.735 --> 08:49.693
<i>for that toffee which you could
chew for hours, it seems to me now.</i>

08:49.782 --> 08:53.731
<i>And even after it had gone
down, you could swallow...</i>

08:53.827 --> 08:57.778
<i>and still find the taste of
it hiding behind your tongue.</i>

08:59.083 --> 09:02.748
<i>It is with me now, so many years later.</i>

09:04.296 --> 09:08.128
<i>It makes me think of so much
that was good that is gone.</i>

09:12.722 --> 09:18.509
<i>It was on this afternoon that
I first saw Bron - Bronwyn.</i>

09:18.602 --> 09:23.940
<i>She had come over from the next valley for
her first call on my father and mother.</i>

09:29.071 --> 09:31.070
Is this Gwilym Morgan's house?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
You must be Huw.

09:56.956 --> 09:59.706
● Is that you, Bronwyn?
● Yes.

10:02.521 --> 10:04.521
There's lovely you are.

10:05.731 --> 10:08.567
<i>I think I fell in love with Bronwyn then.</i>

10:09.235 --> 10:12.090
<i>Perhaps it is foolish
to think a child could</i>

10:12.103 --> 10:14.905
<i>fall in love, but I am
the child that was...</i>

10:14.991 --> 10:18.774
<i>and nobody knows how I
felt, except only me.</i>

10:27.336 --> 10:31.001
● I'm so proud for Ivor.
● I'm the one to be proud.

10:31.090 --> 10:35.419
You think well of our Ivor?
It seems only a few months...

10:35.511 --> 10:39.343
since he was scratching around here
like this one, with his mouth open.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.971
This is Bronwyn, Huw,
who's to be your sister.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.554
We have met already.

10:49.608 --> 10:53.309
Be careful of the basket.
There's shortcake in it.

11:30.064 --> 11:34.643
This is not for you. You will have
your time to come. Run along now.

12:42.593 --> 12:46.722
<i>Bronwyn and Ivor were to be married
by the new preacher, Mr. Gruffydd...</i>

12:46.806 --> 12:49.593
<i>who had come from the
university at Cardiff.</i>

12:49.684 --> 12:52.175
<i>This was my first sight of him.</i>

15:17.245 --> 15:21.325
♪ Now here's a man won't get drunk,
can't get drunk, shan't get drunk

15:21.416 --> 15:25.283
♪ Here's a man won't get drunk, Peter O'Pea

15:25.378 --> 15:30.170

15:45.022 --> 15:48.141
● Good evening, Mr. Morgan.
● Yes, indeed, sir.

15:50.236 --> 15:52.691
● Excuse me.
● Thank you.

17:09.913 --> 17:12.535
Come now, boys. Back to work.

17:16.045 --> 17:19.911
Ivor, find Dai Griffiths and Idris John
and bring them to Mr. Evans's office.

17:20.006 --> 17:23.257
● Will we come with you?
● No. This is a matter for the older men.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.550
● Home to your mother.
● But -

17:25.637 --> 17:27.878
Leave it now, Davy.

17:27.973 --> 17:30.262
Well, come.

17:42.363 --> 17:45.944
● Why aren't you washed?
● We were waiting for you.

17:48.951 --> 17:52.403
The cut is only a few shillings.
There will still be plenty for us.

17:52.497 --> 17:54.988
A bit of supper now, is it, girl?

17:56.584 --> 17:59.668
It is because they are not
getting the old price for coal.

17:59.754 --> 18:03.087
● Come and wash now.
● May we speak first, sir?

18:04.509 --> 18:07.544
● Yes.
● They did not give you the real reason.

18:07.636 --> 18:11.337
We've been expecting it since the
ironworks at Dowlais closed down.

18:11.432 --> 18:13.389
What have the ironworks to do with us?

18:13.476 --> 18:18.269
The men from Dowlais will work for any
wage, so all our wages must come down.

18:18.356 --> 18:21.356
And this is only the beginning. Watch now.

18:21.442 --> 18:24.717
They will cut us again
and still again, until

18:24.730 --> 18:27.730
they have this as empty
as their promises.

18:27.823 --> 18:32.900
● A good worker is worth good wages. ● Not
while there are three men for every job.

18:32.995 --> 18:35.949
Why should the owners pay more
if men will work for less?

18:36.039 --> 18:39.539
Because the owners are not savages.
They are men too, like us.

18:39.627 --> 18:41.869
Men, yes, but not like us.

18:41.962 --> 18:45.164
Would they deal with you just
now, sir, when you went to them?

18:45.256 --> 18:48.211
● No.
● Because they have power and we have none.

18:48.302 --> 18:52.963
● How will we get power, then? From the
air? ● No. From a union of all the men.

18:53.056 --> 18:59.010
Union, is it? I never thought I'd hear
my own sons talking socialist nonsense.

18:59.103 --> 19:01.642
● It's good sense.
● Unless we stand together -

19:01.732 --> 19:05.681
● I've had enough of this talk.
● But, Father, it does -

19:09.072 --> 19:11.444
Come and wash now.

19:11.532 --> 19:14.106
Your good mother will be waiting.

19:36.015 --> 19:38.344
Do you think I'll let
them make you stand in

19:38.357 --> 19:40.593
the rain and not raise
my hands to stop it?

19:40.686 --> 19:42.810
Hush, Davy.

19:43.523 --> 19:47.222
● Who gave you permission to speak?
● It is too important for silence.

19:47.317 --> 19:52.941
● They're trying to punish you because - ●
It is not more important than good manners.

19:53.324 --> 19:57.238
But what are we going to do about it?
You'll die of cold when it comes to snow.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.901
Let us stand together and
see how they act then.

19:59.997 --> 20:03.246
Right. The men will come
out if we say the word.

20:03.333 --> 20:06.085
All the pits are ready.

20:06.170 --> 20:08.562
You'll not make me a
plank for your politics.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.665
I will not be the
excuse for any strike.

20:10.965 --> 20:15.260
But if they do that to the spokesman,
what will they try and do to the men?

20:15.345 --> 20:17.836
We will see. Be silent now.
Finish your supper.

20:17.931 --> 20:19.758
● Father -
● Enough now.

20:19.850 --> 20:22.422
● But -
● On with your work.

20:23.769 --> 20:27.684
● It is not enough.
● Wait until you have permission to speak.

20:27.774 --> 20:32.067
I will speak against injustice anywhere,
with permission or without it.

20:32.152 --> 20:35.604
● Not in this house.
● In this house and outside, sir.

20:36.824 --> 20:40.028
● Leave the table.
● I will leave the house.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.239
● Tell your father you're sorry.
● I'm not sorry.

20:43.331 --> 20:46.533
I'm with you. We can find
lodgings in the village.

20:46.626 --> 20:48.702
Gwilym.

20:54.634 --> 20:56.958
All of you, then?

21:01.349 --> 21:05.014
For the last time, sit down, finish
your supper. I will say no more.

21:05.102 --> 21:08.104
We are not questioning your authority, sir.

21:08.188 --> 21:13.395
But if manners prevent our speaking the
truth, we will be without manners.

21:14.236 --> 21:16.906
Get your clothes and go.

21:31.962 --> 21:37.336
● I'm going with them to look after them. ●
Hold your tongue. Get on with your dishes.

21:58.446 --> 22:01.649
Yes, my son, I know you are there.

22:55.127 --> 22:57.617
The men have struck.

23:17.107 --> 23:19.680
What does it mean, Mr. Gruffydd?

23:21.151 --> 23:23.524
It means that...

23:25.406 --> 23:29.735
something has gone out of this
valley that may never be replaced.

23:29.828 --> 23:33.906
Home to your father and mother, boy.
They'll need you today.

23:54.768 --> 23:59.845
<i>Twenty-two weeks the men were out
as the strike moved into winter.</i>

23:59.940 --> 24:05.279
<i>It was strange to go out into the street
and find the men there in the daytime.</i>

24:05.362 --> 24:07.853
<i>It had a feeling of fright in it.</i>

24:08.574 --> 24:11.609
<i>And always the mood of
the men grew uglier...</i>

24:11.700 --> 24:16.078
<i>as empty bellies and desperation
began to conquer reason.</i>

24:18.333 --> 24:22.626
<i>Any man who was not their
friend became their enemy.</i>

24:23.254 --> 24:26.540
<i>They knew that my father
had opposed the strike...</i>

24:26.633 --> 24:29.550
<i>and now it was they who opposed him.</i>

25:18.809 --> 25:22.307
Huw, there's a meeting of the men
in the hills tonight, is it?

25:22.395 --> 25:24.305
● Yes, Momma.
● You will take me.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.473
No, Momma. It is no place for women.

25:26.566 --> 25:31.394
There is a place for this woman
there tonight, upon my soul.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.734
Wait. Wait till you hear me.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.825
I am Beth Morgan, as you damn well know.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.770
I have come to tell you
what I think of you,

25:40.783 --> 25:43.286
because you are talking
against my husband.

25:43.374 --> 25:46.410
You're a lot of cowards to go against him.

25:46.502 --> 25:50.167
He would do nothing against you and
he never has, and you know him well.

25:50.255 --> 25:57.219
How you smug-faced hypocrites can sit in
the same chapel with him, I cannot tell.

25:57.554 --> 26:01.635
To say he is with the owners is not only
nonsense, but downright wickedness.

26:02.017 --> 26:05.220
There's one thing more I've
got to say, and it is this.

26:05.312 --> 26:08.148
If harm comes to my Gwilym...

26:08.232 --> 26:13.523
I'll find out the men and I will
kill them with my two hands.

26:13.612 --> 26:16.898
And this I will swear by God Almighty.

26:53.443 --> 26:55.851
Ianto! Help!

27:03.912 --> 27:06.996
Hold on, Momma. They've heard us.
They're coming.

27:50.290 --> 27:52.781
He was awake just now.

27:56.380 --> 28:00.875
He'll do, then. But it's
beyond me to say why.

28:02.051 --> 28:05.467
You're breeding horses in
this family, Mr. Morgan.

28:06.682 --> 28:10.299
This boy should be in his
coffin, for my part.

28:10.392 --> 28:12.681
He's a Morgan then, is it, sir?

28:13.897 --> 28:17.645
He should be fed now, Mrs.
Ivor. A little soup...

28:19.610 --> 28:22.101
and some warm smiles.

28:32.707 --> 28:35.280
Horse.

28:35.668 --> 28:39.582
● Good day. Wait, wait, wait.
● Huw was awake just now. He spoke to Bron.

28:39.671 --> 28:42.958
● How long then for the little one?
● It's hard to tell.

28:43.050 --> 28:47.047
His legs were frozen to the bone. A
year, two years, quiet like that.

28:47.137 --> 28:52.380
But I can't promise that he'll ever walk
again. Nature must take her course. Gee up.

28:53.602 --> 28:56.520
Mind your tongue. I think he heard you.

29:16.040 --> 29:19.624
Where is the light I thought
to see in your eye?

29:21.922 --> 29:24.209
Are you afraid, boy?

29:30.972 --> 29:34.009
● You heard what the doctor said?
● Yes, sir.

29:34.642 --> 29:37.132
And you believed it?

29:37.728 --> 29:39.805
Yes, sir.

29:40.940 --> 29:43.431
You want to walk again, don't you?

29:43.526 --> 29:45.815
Yes, sir.

29:46.779 --> 29:49.104
Then you must have faith.

29:49.198 --> 29:54.109
And if you have, you will walk again,
no matter what all the doctors say.

29:55.454 --> 29:59.154
But he said nature must take her course.

30:01.919 --> 30:04.754
Nature is the handmaiden of the Lord.

30:06.339 --> 30:11.334
I remember one or two occasions when she
was given orders to change her course.

30:11.427 --> 30:15.046
● You know your scriptures, boy.
● Yes, sir.

30:15.140 --> 30:19.766
Then you know that what's been done
before can be done again, for you.

30:21.355 --> 30:23.726
Do you believe me, Huw?

30:24.357 --> 30:26.895
● Yes, sir.
● Good.

30:26.984 --> 30:30.484
You will see the first
daffodil, out on the mountain.

30:30.572 --> 30:34.071
● Will you?
● Indeed I will, sir.

30:34.658 --> 30:37.067
Then you will.

30:40.373 --> 30:42.865
I could almost wish...

30:42.959 --> 30:46.162
that I were lying there in your place...

30:46.254 --> 30:50.204
if it meant reading this book
again for the first time.

30:51.175 --> 30:54.924
<i>Treasure Island.</i>

31:23.790 --> 31:25.997
Mr. Gruffydd?

31:27.127 --> 31:31.456
● I couldn't let you go without thanking
you. ● It was only my duty, girl.

31:31.548 --> 31:33.874
No. It was more than duty.

31:34.968 --> 31:37.423
Yes. Huw's a fine boy.

31:37.512 --> 31:40.430
And you're a fine family.

31:40.515 --> 31:44.347
You'd better be going in now.
You'll catch your death.

31:45.186 --> 31:48.637
Will you be coming to supper soon?

31:48.731 --> 31:52.396
Yes. Later, when you're
finished with doctors and such.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.150
● I will hurry them away, then.
● Good.

32:02.078 --> 32:05.945
"Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and
the rest of these gentlemen...

32:06.040 --> 32:11.247
"having asked me to write down the whole
particulars about Treasure Island...

32:14.631 --> 32:17.129
"from the beginning to
the end, keeping nothing

32:17.142 --> 32:19.128
back but the bearings
of the island...

32:19.220 --> 32:22.387
"and that only because there is
still treasure not yet lifted...

32:22.474 --> 32:27.348
"I take up my pen in the
year of grace 1785...

32:33.108 --> 32:37.272
"and go back to the time when my
father kept the Admiral Benbow inn."

32:39.865 --> 32:44.112
<i>All the noble books which have
lived in my mind ever since...</i>

32:44.495 --> 32:47.067
<i>and always I hoped, and kept my faith.</i>

32:48.122 --> 32:51.658
<i>For the first months my
mother was still upstairs...</i>

32:51.752 --> 32:55.286
<i>and we could talk to each
other with tappings.</i>

34:01.486 --> 34:03.609
Spring?

34:15.917 --> 34:18.206
There you are, girl.

34:20.130 --> 34:22.371
Easy.

34:22.466 --> 34:24.541
There.

34:26.510 --> 34:28.585
Wait.

34:41.067 --> 34:43.355
It's the old snow got into it.

35:48.216 --> 35:50.291
Gwilym.

35:51.093 --> 35:54.033
There is a wife you have,
resting in her bed

35:54.046 --> 35:56.800
and letting strangers
care for her family.

35:56.891 --> 35:59.382
There is a wife I have, then.

35:59.477 --> 36:01.932
Go along with you, boy.

36:06.379 --> 36:14.379
♪ Paham mae dicter, O Myfanwy
♪ Yn llenwi'th lygaid duon di

36:20.977 --> 36:28.977

37:12.882 --> 37:15.586
Will you say something, Mother?

37:17.761 --> 37:20.300
Go on, say something.

37:20.390 --> 37:22.678
What can I say?

37:23.230 --> 37:26.086
You found plenty to say
last time you spoke.

37:26.099 --> 37:28.520
It should be easier
now, with friends.

37:31.915 --> 37:34.074
Well -

37:34.237 --> 37:37.521
Well. Come and eat, everyone.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.906
More, is it, boys?

37:56.633 --> 37:58.709
Ianto.

37:58.802 --> 38:01.553
I haven't seen you in chapel lately.

38:01.637 --> 38:05.386
● I have been too busy.
● What business, may I ask?

38:05.475 --> 38:09.639
● Mine.
● Only asking a civil question, I was.

38:09.730 --> 38:13.678
And having a civil answer. I
have been busy with the union.

38:14.316 --> 38:18.979
Unions are the work of the Devil.
You will come to no good end.

38:19.072 --> 38:22.357
At least I am not sitting on
it, talking rubbish in chapel.

38:22.450 --> 38:26.578
● Look here - ● Leave it, or
I'll say something to be sorry.

38:26.662 --> 38:29.331
This is a matter that requires airing.

38:30.374 --> 38:34.503
Ianto, why do you think we
at the chapel talk rubbish?

38:35.046 --> 38:37.881
My remark was not aimed at you.

38:37.965 --> 38:40.254
Then aim it.

38:41.593 --> 38:43.669
Very well.

38:45.098 --> 38:49.675
Because you make yourselves out
to be shepherds of the flock...

38:49.768 --> 38:54.181
and yet you allow your sheep
to live in filth and poverty.

38:54.273 --> 38:57.523
And if they try and raise
their voices against it...

38:57.609 --> 39:02.271
you calm them by telling them their
suffering is the will of God.

39:03.323 --> 39:09.112
Sheep, indeed. Are we sheep to be herded
and sheared by a handful of owners?

39:10.872 --> 39:15.333
I was taught man was made in
the image of God, not a sheep.

39:15.418 --> 39:18.538
● lanto.
● I haven't expressed my views...

39:18.630 --> 39:23.506
because I haven't had any wish to
interfere in a family disagreement.

39:23.593 --> 39:26.546
You have my permission to speak.

39:26.637 --> 39:29.971
Very well, then. Here is what I think.

39:30.058 --> 39:33.142
First, have your union.

39:33.227 --> 39:38.138
You need it. Alone, you are weak.
Together, you are strong.

39:38.232 --> 39:43.523
But remember that with strength goes
responsibility, to others and yourselves.

39:43.613 --> 39:47.397
For you cannot conquer injustice
with more injustice...

39:47.491 --> 39:49.816
only with justice, and the help of God.

39:49.910 --> 39:53.694
Are you coming outside your
position in life, Mr. Gruffydd?

39:53.789 --> 39:56.115
Your business is spiritual.

39:56.209 --> 39:59.412
My business is anything between
man and the spirit of God.

39:59.503 --> 40:03.335
The deacons shall hear that you
have been preaching socialism.

40:03.424 --> 40:05.879
● Mr. Parry -
● Loose the old devil.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.044
● Mr. Parry -
● Stop now. He is our guest.

40:08.136 --> 40:10.787
● Beth, a pint of home-brew for Mr.
Parry. ●

40:10.800 --> 40:13.343
I'll give him a clout
with the frying pan.

40:14.684 --> 40:18.932
Miss Jenkins. A sweet song. The harp,
is it? Come on, men. Get in here.

40:19.022 --> 40:21.311
Now look, a little song -

40:38.792 --> 40:40.867
Angharad.

40:40.960 --> 40:46.002
Mr. Gruffydd, will we always be in your
debt? Now you have made us a family again.

40:48.718 --> 40:51.089
Here. Let me.

41:01.438 --> 41:04.273
Your hands. There's a pity.

41:04.358 --> 41:06.647
No matter.

41:09.864 --> 41:12.189
Have you ever been down the collieries?

41:12.283 --> 41:14.856
● Ten years.
● Ten years?

41:14.952 --> 41:17.443
While I was studying.

41:19.289 --> 41:22.410
● A bit of soap now.
● Don't bother, please.

41:25.962 --> 41:29.747
There's a man for you, spoiling
his good handkerchief.

41:30.759 --> 41:35.885
Look now, you are king in the chapel,
but I will be queen in my own kitchen.

41:35.973 --> 41:38.677
You will be queen wherever you walk.

41:41.394 --> 41:44.182
What does that mean?

41:44.273 --> 41:46.479
I should not have said it.

41:46.566 --> 41:48.855
Why?

41:50.612 --> 41:53.316
I have no right to speak to you so.

41:58.912 --> 42:01.200
Mr. Gruffydd?

42:02.956 --> 42:05.448
If the right is mine to give...

42:06.878 --> 42:09.369
you have it.

42:26.480 --> 42:31.521
<i>Then the strike was settled, with the
help of Mr. Gruffydd and my father.</i>

42:31.610 --> 42:36.984
<i>Work again, work to wipe out the
memory of idleness and hardship.</i>

42:37.074 --> 42:40.277
<i>The men were happy going
up the hill that morning.</i>

42:40.369 --> 42:42.445
● One and nine.
● One and ten.

42:48.586 --> 42:52.796
<i>But not all of them, for there were
too many now for the jobs open...</i>

42:52.880 --> 42:58.551
<i>and some learned that never again would
there be work for them in their own valley.</i>

43:14.777 --> 43:17.399
It is the same all over South Wales, it is.

43:18.448 --> 43:24.202
Father, in Cardiff the men are standing in
line to have bread from the government.

43:24.287 --> 43:26.492
Not for us, eh, lad?

43:30.376 --> 43:35.002
We will have our share of the
box and go, if you please, sir.

43:35.674 --> 43:38.590
● Where will you go?
● America.

43:53.607 --> 43:56.062
● My share too, Owen.
● And mine.

43:56.151 --> 43:59.153
No. Our own.

43:59.238 --> 44:03.021
● We will take no charity.
● Not charity, man. Sense.

44:03.116 --> 44:05.489
No, only our own.

44:09.623 --> 44:14.913
Say nothing of this to your mother.
Let this day be over first.

44:15.003 --> 44:17.624
Never mind saying nothing.

44:17.713 --> 44:20.003
I heard.

44:24.220 --> 44:26.794
America.

44:26.889 --> 44:29.380
My babies.

44:42.238 --> 44:44.729
Shall we have a chapter, my sons?

44:50.537 --> 44:53.324
What shall we have, sir?

44:53.415 --> 44:55.658
Isaiah 55.

44:57.294 --> 44:59.832
Those two gone. This is only the beginning.

44:59.922 --> 45:03.207
Then all of you will go, one
after the other. All of you.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.458
I will never leave you, Momma.

45:05.552 --> 45:10.131
Huw, boy, if you should ever leave
me, I'll be sorry I ever had babies.

45:11.183 --> 45:13.674
Why did you have them?

45:15.354 --> 45:17.560
Indeed to goodness, boy, why?

45:17.648 --> 45:21.515
To keep my hands in water and
my face to the fire, perhaps.

45:42.046 --> 45:44.538
For Mr. Ivor Morgan.

45:46.301 --> 45:48.970
From Windsor Castle it is.

46:23.295 --> 46:27.458
"Mr. Ivor Morgan is commanded
to appear before Her Maj -

46:28.925 --> 46:33.718
"Mr. Ivor Morgan is commanded to appear
before Her Majesty at Windsor Castle...

46:33.806 --> 46:36.483
"with chosen members of
his choir, on the 14th

46:36.496 --> 46:39.012
of May between the hours
of three and five."

46:44.774 --> 46:47.231
To sing before the Queen.

46:47.319 --> 46:50.687
My son, I never thought to
see this beautiful day.

46:50.780 --> 46:55.739
Idris, Owen, all of you. Fetch
everyone from all the valleys round.

46:55.911 --> 46:59.445
Davy, over to the other collieries.
Invite everyone.

46:59.539 --> 47:04.746
Ianto, down to the Three Bells for beer.
Open house tonight for all who will come.

47:10.884 --> 47:14.880
My sons, you shall have a
sendoff worthy of the Morgans.

47:46.418 --> 47:51.329
Our Heavenly Father, I give thanks
from the heart to live this day.

47:51.882 --> 47:56.460
I give thanks for all I have, and I
do give thanks for this new blessing.

47:57.303 --> 48:01.765
For you are our Father, but we
look to our Queen as our mother.

48:02.059 --> 48:05.143
Comfort her in her troubles, O God...

48:05.228 --> 48:09.771
and let her worries be not more
than she shall bear at her age.

48:11.359 --> 48:14.858
And grant that sweetness
and power and spirit...

48:14.946 --> 48:18.528
may be given to these voices
that shall sing at her command.

48:18.699 --> 48:20.989
● Amen.
● Amen.

49:20.260 --> 49:23.464
Good morning, Mr. Gruffydd.
Angharad is down to the market.

49:23.555 --> 49:25.762
Angharad? I've come for Huw.

49:25.849 --> 49:28.137
For Huw?

49:28.809 --> 49:31.846
● The daffodils are out, Momma.
● Where are your clothes?

49:31.938 --> 49:35.982
Under my pillow. For these
months, ready for today.

49:36.067 --> 49:40.111
Come you, then, and you shall bring
back a posy fit for a queen...

49:40.821 --> 49:42.897
for your brave mother.

49:42.990 --> 49:45.482
Indeed I will, sir.

49:52.458 --> 49:54.913
● Almost there, Huw.
● Yes, sir.

49:55.336 --> 49:58.420
● Low bridge there. Watch out.
● It's fun.

49:58.505 --> 50:00.997
● All right?
● Yes, sir.

50:11.602 --> 50:14.093
● All right?
● Yes, sir.

50:24.990 --> 50:27.481
Easy it is, now.

50:27.576 --> 50:29.652
There.

50:36.585 --> 50:38.874
Cwm Rhondda.

50:45.927 --> 50:48.419
You can walk, Huw, if you try.

50:50.349 --> 50:53.432
Come, lad. You can walk.

50:56.938 --> 50:59.429
Huw. Walk.

51:07.323 --> 51:10.241
There's a good lad. Come on.

51:15.455 --> 51:17.495
See?

51:17.583 --> 51:19.990
There's a good old man.

51:24.549 --> 51:26.956
You've been lucky, Huw.

51:27.051 --> 51:32.472
Lucky to suffer, and lucky to
spend these weary months in bed.

51:33.724 --> 51:39.229
For so God has given you a chance
to make spirit within yourself.

51:39.312 --> 51:43.855
And as your father cleans his
lamp to have good light...

51:43.942 --> 51:46.315
so keep clean your spirit, huh?

51:46.403 --> 51:48.526
How, sir?

51:52.158 --> 51:54.828
By prayer, Huw.

51:54.911 --> 51:58.114
And by prayer I don't mean
shouting and mumbling...

51:58.206 --> 52:02.121
and wallowing like a hog
in religious sentiment.

52:02.210 --> 52:07.205
Prayer is only another name for
good, clean, direct thinking.

52:08.883 --> 52:11.967
When you pray, think.

52:12.053 --> 52:14.130
Think well what you're saying.

52:14.222 --> 52:17.258
Make your thoughts into
things that are solid...

52:17.349 --> 52:20.684
and in that way your
prayer will have strength.

52:20.770 --> 52:25.764
And that strength will become a part
of you, body, mind, and spirit.

52:27.193 --> 52:31.985
And the first duty of these new legs
is to get you to chapel on Sunday.

52:33.240 --> 52:37.618
● Indeed they will, sir.
● There's a good old man again.

52:40.497 --> 52:42.786
Give me your hand.

52:49.549 --> 52:51.836
Come on, now.

53:54.236 --> 53:59.230
Will you please remain in your places?
There's to be a meeting of the deacons.

54:17.425 --> 54:19.501
Meillyn Lewis.

54:21.430 --> 54:23.921
Step forward.

54:55.921 --> 54:58.460
Your sins have found you out.

54:59.217 --> 55:02.466
And now you must pay the
price of all women like you.

55:02.887 --> 55:07.679
You have brought a child into the
world against the commandment.

55:07.766 --> 55:10.008
Prayer is wasted on your sort.

55:10.394 --> 55:15.021
You shall be cast out into the utter
darkness till you have learned your lesson.

55:16.232 --> 55:20.065
Meillyn Lewis, do you admit your sin?

55:27.119 --> 55:29.027
Yes.

55:30.496 --> 55:32.988
Then prepare to suffer your punishment.

55:33.083 --> 55:35.918
Stop it. Leave her alone, you hypocrite.

55:36.002 --> 55:38.125
● Leave it now, Mr. Morgan.
● Sit down.

55:38.213 --> 55:40.289
Angharad.

55:45.720 --> 55:50.631
How could you watch them? Cruel old men,
groaning and nodding to hurt her more.

55:50.725 --> 55:55.434
That is not the word of God. "Go
thou and sin no more," Jesus said.

55:58.107 --> 56:00.183
Angharad.

56:10.494 --> 56:13.059
● You know your Bible too
well, life too little.

56:13.072 --> 56:15.490
● I know Meillyn Lewis
is no worse than I am.

56:15.584 --> 56:19.366
● Angharad.
● What do the deacons know about it?

56:19.461 --> 56:23.294
What do you know about what could
happen to a poor girl when...

56:23.382 --> 56:28.458
when she loves a man so much that even to
lose sight of him for a moment is torture?

56:41.045 --> 56:43.046
Meillyn.

56:46.405 --> 56:49.026
● Does it hurt you, Huw?
● Easy, now.

56:49.783 --> 56:51.860
Huw?

56:58.625 --> 57:00.914
Angharad.

57:01.002 --> 57:04.372
I am a man now. Kindly leave the kitchen.

57:04.465 --> 57:06.955
So you're a man now, is it?

57:12.139 --> 57:16.432
Beth. Blasphemy, sacrilege, and hypocrisy.

57:16.518 --> 57:19.435
Can't a man smoke and read
a paper on the Sabbath?

57:19.520 --> 57:21.809
Go and blow your nose.

57:25.317 --> 57:27.192
Come in.

57:27.946 --> 57:30.021
Come in.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.828
What under the blazes -

57:38.914 --> 57:42.746
● Good morning, Morgan.
● Good morning, Mr. Evans.

57:42.834 --> 57:46.417
● Sit down, sir. Sit down, sir.
● Thank you.

57:49.008 --> 57:51.629
Mr. Evans.

57:51.719 --> 57:54.506
The mine owner himself.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.589
Angharad.

58:02.771 --> 58:05.261
● Now to business.
● Yes, sir.

58:09.778 --> 58:14.190
I've come here on a very
delicate mission, Morgan.

58:14.282 --> 58:17.236
● No trouble, sir?
● No. No trouble.

58:17.327 --> 58:21.075
● But it worries me.
● Yes, sir.

58:22.541 --> 58:25.791
I'm here to get your permission...

58:27.670 --> 58:30.375
that my son lestyn

58:31.340 --> 58:33.416
may have permission -

58:35.344 --> 58:37.421
● Bless you, Morgan.
● Thank you, sir.

58:39.891 --> 58:42.844
● Now where was I?
● "Permission"?

58:42.934 --> 58:46.138
Yes. That my son lestyn...

58:46.230 --> 58:50.358
may have permission, with
your daughter's permission...

58:50.442 --> 58:53.147
to call upon her. There we are.

59:00.870 --> 59:03.906
We are a very proud family, Mr. Evans.

59:03.997 --> 59:06.571
Yes, I know. I know, Morgan.

59:06.667 --> 59:10.534
But this is not my doing, Morgan.
It's that young whelp of a -

59:10.629 --> 59:14.793
Mr. Evans. Your son has my
permission to speak to me.

59:15.843 --> 59:19.176
Thank you, Morgan. I'm
very much obliged to you.

59:19.262 --> 59:21.338
Yes, sir.

59:21.806 --> 59:25.471
Good old Welsh blood, you know,
and all that sort of thing.

59:25.560 --> 59:29.427
● I'm very much obliged, Morgan.
● Yes, sir.

59:30.273 --> 59:32.230
Beth.

59:32.316 --> 59:35.437
Come, come, come. My shoes. Get my shoes.

59:35.528 --> 59:40.357
You, girl. Get up to your room. Have you
no modesty left in you? Get up there.

59:40.451 --> 59:43.367
Get your hands out. My shoes.
Find the shoes.

59:43.452 --> 59:45.943
Why don't you get your jackets on?

59:52.879 --> 59:54.871
Mr. Morgan?

59:54.964 --> 59:57.253
Sit down.

01:00:07.058 --> 01:00:09.348
This is my wife, Mrs. Morgan.

01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:12.597
How do you do?

01:00:13.816 --> 01:00:16.671
Mr. Morgan, I've come
to ask your permission

01:00:16.684 --> 01:00:18.976
to speak to your
daughter, Angharad.

01:00:30.624 --> 01:00:32.996
These are my sons.

01:00:33.627 --> 01:00:35.785
Yes. I know them.

01:00:43.594 --> 01:00:45.967
God bless you.

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:50.117
You shouldn't be here.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.543
I couldn't spend another
night without knowing.

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.500
What has happened? Is anything wrong?

01:01:56.591 --> 01:02:00.042
● Wrong?
● You know what I mean.

01:02:00.136 --> 01:02:04.430
Why have you changed towards me?
Why am I a stranger now?

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:07.006
Have I done anything?

01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:10.887
No.

01:02:12.565 --> 01:02:14.641
The blame is mine.

01:02:16.027 --> 01:02:18.268
Your mother spoke to me after chapel.

01:02:18.362 --> 01:02:22.027
She's happy to think you'll be
having plenty all of your days.

01:02:22.115 --> 01:02:24.405
With lestyn Evans.

01:02:26.954 --> 01:02:29.989
● You could do no better.
● I don't want him.

01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:31.991
I want you.

01:02:32.084 --> 01:02:34.041
Angharad?

01:02:39.675 --> 01:02:43.125
I have spent nights too,
trying to think this out.

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:48.678
When I took up this work,
I knew what it meant.

01:02:48.767 --> 01:02:51.804
It meant sacrifice and devotion.

01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:58.478
It meant making it my whole life to the
- to the exclusion of everything else.

01:02:59.403 --> 01:03:02.107
That I was perfectly willing to do.

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:07.398
But to share it with another -

01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:10.954
do you think I will have
you going threadbare...

01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:14.076
depending on the charity of
others for your good meals?

01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:17.038
Our children growing up
in cast-off clothing...

01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:20.711
and ourselves thanking God for
parenthood in a house full of bits?

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:25.425
No. I can bear with such a life
for the sake of my work...

01:03:26.262 --> 01:03:28.967
but I think I'd start to kill if -

01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:35.267
if I saw the white come to your
hair 20 years before its time.

01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:38.723
Why?

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.144
Why would you start to kill?

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:47.608
Are you a man or a saint?

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:52.276
I am no saint. But I
have a duty towards you.

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:54.778
Let me do it.

01:05:36.848 --> 01:05:41.225
Is there to be no singing for my
daughter's wedding, Dai Bando?

01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:34.377
Now then. The bathtub holds 100 gallons.

01:06:36.865 --> 01:06:41.693
"A" fills it at the rate
of 20 gallons a minute...

01:06:42.621 --> 01:06:45.824
and "B" at the rate of
ten gallons a minute.

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:50.248
● Got that, Mr. Morgan?
● Twenty and ten gallons. Yes, sir.

01:06:50.337 --> 01:06:55.793
Now then. "C" is a hole that empties it
at the rate of five gallons a minute.

01:06:56.467 --> 01:06:59.883
How long to fill the tub?

01:07:05.226 --> 01:07:09.306
There is silly. Trying to fill a
bathtub full of holes, indeed.

01:07:09.856 --> 01:07:13.307
A sum it is, girl. A sum.
A problem for the mind.

01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:16.854
● For his examination into school.
● That old national school.

01:07:16.946 --> 01:07:19.086
'Tis silly they are
with their sums. Who

01:07:19.099 --> 01:07:21.407
would pour water in a
bathtub full of holes?

01:07:21.492 --> 01:07:25.359
● Who would think of it? Only a madman.
● It is to see if the boy can calculate.

01:07:25.454 --> 01:07:29.239
Figures, nothing else. How
many gallons, and how long.

01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:32.157
In a bathtub full of holes.

01:07:34.754 --> 01:07:37.756
Now I know why I have such a tribe of sons.

01:07:37.842 --> 01:07:40.167
It is you, Beth Morgan, is the cause.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.090
Look you, Mr. Gruffydd.
Have you something else?

01:07:44.181 --> 01:07:46.469
The decimal point.

01:07:47.976 --> 01:07:50.384
The decimal.

01:07:50.479 --> 01:07:53.895
The decimal point, then,
and peace to my house.

01:07:53.982 --> 01:07:56.555
● Go and scratch.
● Well, it's getting late.

01:07:56.651 --> 01:08:01.147
I've got to get along. We'll follow
the decimal point tomorrow night.

01:08:01.239 --> 01:08:03.730
● Good night.
● Good night, Mrs. Morgan.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:11.531
<i>Who is there that cannot look back and
remember his first day at a new school?</i>

01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:15.918
<i>To go alone the long walk over
the hills to the next valley...</i>

01:08:16.004 --> 01:08:21.045
<i>the first of my family to have the
privilege of attending a national school.</i>

01:08:58.044 --> 01:09:00.582
So you're the new boy?

01:09:01.381 --> 01:09:03.872
● Yes, sir.
● You're late.

01:09:05.426 --> 01:09:07.502
Yes, sir.

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.046
What a dirty little sweep it is.

01:09:12.017 --> 01:09:14.091
Who are your people?

01:09:14.185 --> 01:09:16.594
● Where are you from?
● Cwm Rhondda.

01:09:17.314 --> 01:09:19.390
Cwm Rhondda?

01:09:21.317 --> 01:09:23.987
A little genius from the coal pits.

01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:28.020
And they expect me to make a scholar of it.
All right, come in.

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:35.408
Were you brought up in stables?

01:09:35.497 --> 01:09:38.072
Well, shut the door.

01:10:12.118 --> 01:10:14.608
Your boots are muddy.

01:10:16.914 --> 01:10:19.998
They were clean when I left home.

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:23.534
You will address me as "sir", or
I'll put a stick about your back.

01:10:23.628 --> 01:10:26.334
● Now sit down here.
● Yes, sir.

01:10:57.078 --> 01:11:00.162
Come here, you dirty little sweep.

01:11:01.499 --> 01:11:03.990
What have we here?

01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:06.658
A pencil box.

01:11:06.754 --> 01:11:09.043
Pretty, too.

01:11:13.218 --> 01:11:15.710
You broke my pencil box.

01:11:24.104 --> 01:11:26.678
Mervyn, stop it. You'll hurt him.

01:12:02.976 --> 01:12:05.052
I fell on the mountain.

01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:10.644
Did you win, Huw?

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.477
No.

01:12:15.405 --> 01:12:17.480
Ianto.

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.579
● Fetch Dai Bando.
● Dai Bando, is it?

01:12:59.864 --> 01:13:02.985
● Are you willing to go to school tomorrow?
● Yes, sir.

01:13:03.076 --> 01:13:08.662
Good. You shall get a penny for every mark
on your face, sixpence for a bloody nose...

01:13:08.747 --> 01:13:11.951
a shilling for a black eye, two
shillings for a broken nose.

01:13:12.043 --> 01:13:14.997
Gwilym. Stop it. Fight again...

01:13:15.088 --> 01:13:18.956
and when you come home, not a look
will you get from me, not a word.

01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:23.214
Break your own nose, then. Break my heart
every time you go out of the house.

01:13:23.304 --> 01:13:26.389
● A boy must fight, Beth.
● Fight?

01:13:26.474 --> 01:13:29.475
Fight? Another beating like
that, he will walk home dead.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.803
Beating? He's had no beating.

01:13:31.897 --> 01:13:33.972
A hiding, yes, but no beating.

01:13:34.064 --> 01:13:38.229
Give the boy time, it will be he
that's giving the beating, is it?

01:13:38.319 --> 01:13:40.395
Dai Bando. Come into the house.

01:13:41.864 --> 01:13:44.984
● Good evening, Mrs. Morgan.
● Leave off your hat.

01:13:58.714 --> 01:14:01.383
Dai Bando is going to
teach you to box, Huw.

01:14:01.467 --> 01:14:05.797
To fight first. Too many call themselves
boxers who are not even fighters.

01:14:05.888 --> 01:14:08.674
● Boxing is an art, is it?
● It is, it is.

01:14:09.849 --> 01:14:12.422
Go along with you, girl. A
cup of tea for the men.

01:14:12.518 --> 01:14:14.595
● Tea?
● Tea?

01:14:14.688 --> 01:14:17.357
No tea, Mrs. Morgan.

01:14:17.858 --> 01:14:20.147
In training, he is.

01:14:20.652 --> 01:14:23.855
A glass of beer, if you please.

01:14:26.699 --> 01:14:29.108
Baths full of holes.

01:14:29.536 --> 01:14:31.908
And now prizefighters.

01:15:04.862 --> 01:15:08.775
So our little coal miner has been
indulging in his favorite sport again?

01:15:08.865 --> 01:15:12.733
● Mr. Phillips, make a back. Make a back.
● I refuse, sir.

01:15:12.828 --> 01:15:15.319
Mr. Wells, make a back.

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:21.043
Here. Put this in between your teeth.

01:15:21.753 --> 01:15:24.042
Bite it hard.

01:15:44.401 --> 01:15:46.689
Well, the scholar.

01:16:02.919 --> 01:16:06.253
● Huw, lad.
● Well, I will go to my death.

01:16:07.132 --> 01:16:10.665
● Did you get that in school?
● He has cut you to the bone. Who was it?

01:16:10.759 --> 01:16:13.333
● Mr. Jonas, is it?
● We'll have a word with Mr. Jonas.

01:16:13.429 --> 01:16:15.422
● No.
● And why not?

01:16:15.515 --> 01:16:19.179
● I broke the rule when I fought.
● There is no rule for that.

01:16:19.268 --> 01:16:21.593
● But he warned me.
● Rubbish, boy. I'll -

01:16:21.687 --> 01:16:23.810
Hush, Davy.

01:16:23.897 --> 01:16:27.432
This is Huw's affair. He shall decide.

01:16:27.527 --> 01:16:31.144
Say the word, lad, and we will
have the bones hot from his flesh.

01:16:31.238 --> 01:16:33.693
No. Leave him alone.

01:16:37.244 --> 01:16:40.862
I think our baby brother
is becoming quite a man.

01:17:05.605 --> 01:17:10.148
These denominations are used
in measuring distances and -

01:17:12.487 --> 01:17:14.942
● Yes?
● Right.

01:17:17.951 --> 01:17:20.109
● Good morning, Mr. -
● Jonas.

01:17:20.203 --> 01:17:24.615
Mr. Jonas. We have come to
the right place indeed.

01:17:26.918 --> 01:17:28.293
What can I do for you?

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:32.328
A man is never too old to
learn, is it, Mr. Jonas?

01:17:33.174 --> 01:17:35.925
● No.
● I was in school myself once.

01:17:36.009 --> 01:17:40.090
● But no great one for knowledge.
● Look here, what do you want?

01:17:40.181 --> 01:17:42.257
Knowledge.

01:17:42.349 --> 01:17:48.802
How would you go about taking the
measurement of a stick, Mr. Jonas?

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:52.396
● By its length, of course.
● And how would you measure a man...

01:17:52.484 --> 01:17:55.355
who would use a stick on a
boy one third his size?

01:17:55.446 --> 01:17:59.394
● Tell us.
● Now, you are good in the use of a stick.

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:04.319
But boxing is my subject, to the rules laid
down by the good Marquess of Queensberry.

01:18:04.412 --> 01:18:06.821
God rest his soul.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:10.915
And happy I am to pass
on my knowledge to you.

01:18:14.047 --> 01:18:17.083
Mr. Mottshill. Mr. Mottshill.

01:18:17.175 --> 01:18:19.547
All right, get him into position, now.

01:18:19.636 --> 01:18:24.796
Look, to make a good boxer, you
must have a good right hand.

01:18:24.891 --> 01:18:26.966
You see?

01:18:27.768 --> 01:18:31.517
Now, that is how you will punish
your man, with a right and a left.

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:33.728
And put your soul into it, with -

01:18:33.815 --> 01:18:36.521
The gentleman is talking to you.

01:18:37.862 --> 01:18:40.732
● Raise him up.
● Come, come, come. Up, up, up.

01:18:40.823 --> 01:18:43.315
Position again.

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:46.737
Could I have your
attention, boys and girls?

01:18:48.997 --> 01:18:51.571
I am not accustomed to
speaking in public...

01:18:51.667 --> 01:18:54.205
● Only public houses.
● but this...

01:18:55.296 --> 01:19:00.041
never use. It's against the rules.
Break a man's nose. Now the -

01:19:04.388 --> 01:19:09.180
● I'm afraid he will never make a boxer.
● No aptitude for knowledge.

01:19:45.319 --> 01:19:47.608
Mr. Gruffydd.

01:20:26.067 --> 01:20:29.769
Ivor. Fell under a tram. Lower level.

01:21:36.945 --> 01:21:39.021
Ivor!

01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:27.784
● We have our first grandson, Gwil.
● Well, give one and take the other.

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:30.658
Tell that to that girl up there.
She will answer you.

01:22:30.748 --> 01:22:34.164
● Hist now, Beth. Do not kindle the wrath.
● To hell with the wrath.

01:22:34.251 --> 01:22:36.921
And I'm saying it plain to be heard.

01:22:42.759 --> 01:22:45.761
'Tis good. With honors, then.

01:22:45.846 --> 01:22:48.336
Our son is a scholar.

01:22:49.307 --> 01:22:52.558
What is it, Huw? I can't
make sense with it.

01:22:52.644 --> 01:22:55.314
● Latin, it is.
● Latin, is it?

01:22:55.397 --> 01:22:58.399
Why not good Welsh, or even English?

01:22:59.234 --> 01:23:01.641
● It is the fashion.
● Fashion.

01:23:01.736 --> 01:23:05.153
Frenchies, decimal points,
and bathtubs full of holes.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.490
My poor Huw. They've stuffed
your head with Latin, then?

01:23:08.577 --> 01:23:11.556
● Beth, my old beauty, you.
A black eye, is it?

01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:14.247
● Go ahead, shout. Wake
up the baby, then.

01:23:14.332 --> 01:23:18.412
There is beautiful. The
image of my father, he is.

01:23:19.963 --> 01:23:22.252
What bloody nonsense.

01:23:25.384 --> 01:23:28.635
Now then, Huw. What will it be?

01:23:28.721 --> 01:23:33.929
To Cardiff to school, then the university
to be a lawyer, is it, or a doctor?

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:40.475
Dr. Huw Morgan. Well, Uncle Huw,
that will be something special.

01:23:40.566 --> 01:23:43.279
Yes, indeed, with a lovely
horse and trap, and

01:23:43.292 --> 01:23:45.726
a good black suit and
a shirt with starch.

01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:49.356
There is good, my little one. Now,
a glass of buttermilk for you...

01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:51.940
with all your knowledge.

01:23:52.578 --> 01:23:56.161
Yes, Mother. And some of Bron's shortcake.

01:23:56.249 --> 01:23:58.786
And my shortcake is to be
fed to the pigs, is it?

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:03.787
No. Only I finished yours yesterday,
and today is shortcake day with Bron.

01:24:04.089 --> 01:24:07.422
I'm sorry, Huw. Only currant
bread I made today.

01:24:08.468 --> 01:24:11.338
Nobody to eat it now.

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:24.774
Mother. I am lonely without him.

01:24:25.735 --> 01:24:29.186
I put his boots and clothes
ready every night...

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:33.616
but they are there still in the morning.

01:24:35.828 --> 01:24:38.319
There is lonely I am.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:51.423
Gwil, I will have Bron here
to live if she will come.

01:24:52.595 --> 01:24:55.133
Not Bron.

01:24:55.222 --> 01:24:57.713
One mistress in the house.

01:24:59.935 --> 01:25:02.391
Now, Huw, what will it be?

01:25:03.438 --> 01:25:06.144
I will go down the colliery with you, sir.

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:09.982
Have sense, boy. The colliery
is no place for you.

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:12.311
Why not try for a respectable job?

01:25:12.406 --> 01:25:16.569
Respectable? Are you and his brothers
a lot of old jailbirds, then?

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:20.326
Leave it now, Beth. I only
want the best for the boy.

01:25:20.414 --> 01:25:23.948
If he is as good a man as you and
his brothers, I will rest happy.

01:25:24.042 --> 01:25:27.542
I am thinking of the boy's future.
It was different in our day.

01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:31.413
There was good money and fair play for all.
But Huw is a scholar.

01:25:31.508 --> 01:25:34.130
Why take brains down a coal mine?

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:36.710
I would rather, sir.

01:25:44.354 --> 01:25:46.560
All right.

01:25:46.648 --> 01:25:49.055
Decide for yourself.

01:25:49.734 --> 01:25:52.439
But blame yourself if you are wrong.

01:25:53.696 --> 01:25:56.104
The colliery, sir.

01:25:57.867 --> 01:26:00.440
● All right, the colliery it is.
● Good.

01:26:06.667 --> 01:26:09.337
● Where are you going?
● To get drunk.

01:26:12.965 --> 01:26:15.041
Bron?

01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:22.223
● I am going down the colliery.
● The colliery, is it?

01:26:24.059 --> 01:26:26.811
The old coal will be shaking in its seam.

01:26:32.693 --> 01:26:34.769
Bron -

01:26:38.157 --> 01:26:39.948
Bron...

01:26:40.033 --> 01:26:44.327
would you have me to live in
this house, and have my wages?

01:26:44.622 --> 01:26:48.239
● Your home is with your mother.
● It was she who sent me.

01:26:49.292 --> 01:26:52.210
● From pity.
● No, from sense.

01:26:52.296 --> 01:26:56.375
If you put clothes night and
morning, let them be my clothes.

01:26:57.592 --> 01:27:01.459
● Good old man.
● Yes or no, Bron?

01:27:03.347 --> 01:27:06.183
● Yes.
● Good.

01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:09.723
Good. I will get my bed.

01:28:43.946 --> 01:28:47.529
● So it is a man now, is it?
● And could I carry such a man?

01:28:47.617 --> 01:28:49.941
Ianto! No.

01:29:03.632 --> 01:29:05.920
Five shillings.

01:29:07.762 --> 01:29:10.252
Seven and tuppence.

01:29:10.347 --> 01:29:13.430
● Move along.
● Thank you, sir.

01:29:13.934 --> 01:29:16.222
Three shillings.

01:29:17.646 --> 01:29:19.934
Two and nine.

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:22.765
One pound two.

01:29:24.569 --> 01:29:26.645
Two pounds ten.

01:29:26.737 --> 01:29:29.229
Discharged, Morgan.

01:29:30.408 --> 01:29:32.484
Move along.

01:29:33.786 --> 01:29:35.863
Two pound ten.

01:29:35.956 --> 01:29:38.446
Discharged, Morgan.

01:29:42.462 --> 01:29:44.538
One pound ten.

01:29:56.893 --> 01:30:01.969
<i>And so it came to lanto and Davy,
the best workers in the colliery...</i>

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:06.643
<i>but too highly paid to compete
with poorer, more desperate men.</i>

01:30:45.858 --> 01:30:49.391
● Will you read us a chapter, Father?
● Yes, my son.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:56.151
"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:59.278
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...

01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:02.205
"he leadeth me beside the still waters.

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.578
"He restoreth my soul...

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:08.879
"he leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:12.462
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

01:31:12.549 --> 01:31:16.417
"I will fear no evil:
for thou art with me...

01:31:16.512 --> 01:31:20.046
"thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:24.636
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies...

01:31:24.728 --> 01:31:27.432
"thou anointest my head with oil...

01:31:37.532 --> 01:31:40.319
"my cup runneth over."

01:31:55.341 --> 01:32:00.004
One line to Owen and Gwil,
down to Cape Town to Angharad.

01:32:01.514 --> 01:32:04.551
Over here to Canada to lanto...

01:32:04.643 --> 01:32:08.011
and down here to Davy in New Zealand.

01:32:08.813 --> 01:32:12.857
And you are the star, shining
on them from this house...

01:32:12.942 --> 01:32:15.563
all the way across the
continents and oceans.

01:32:15.653 --> 01:32:17.645
All the way?

01:32:17.738 --> 01:32:22.733
How far am I shining then, if you can
put it all on a little piece of paper?

01:32:22.827 --> 01:32:27.489
Now, a map it is, my old beauty. A picture
of the world to show you where they are.

01:32:27.581 --> 01:32:30.473
I know where they are,
without any old maps,

01:32:30.486 --> 01:32:32.873
or scratches, or
spiders, or pencils.

01:32:35.798 --> 01:32:38.205
They are in the house.

01:32:59.154 --> 01:33:03.401
<i>Then Angharad came back from
Cape Town without her husband.</i>

01:33:03.491 --> 01:33:07.786
<i>She did not come to us, but
stayed at the big Evans house.</i>

01:33:07.871 --> 01:33:10.362
<i>Her house, on top of the hill.</i>

01:33:27.223 --> 01:33:29.928
● To see Mrs. Evans, please.
● Who is it?

01:33:30.018 --> 01:33:32.094
Huw Morgan.

01:33:36.566 --> 01:33:38.973
Her brother, is it?

01:33:39.735 --> 01:33:42.024
Come in.

01:33:50.913 --> 01:33:53.202
Huw.

01:33:57.587 --> 01:34:01.334
Mrs. Nicholas, will you
bring some tea, please?

01:34:07.888 --> 01:34:09.964
Sit down, Huw.

01:34:12.143 --> 01:34:14.430
There is grown you are.

01:34:14.519 --> 01:34:17.010
● And changed.
● You too.

01:34:19.441 --> 01:34:22.727
I look ill and ought to
take care of myself.

01:34:22.819 --> 01:34:29.153
Everyone coming in the house says so, so
you say it too, and let us finish with it.

01:34:29.242 --> 01:34:31.531
But tell me all the news.

01:34:31.619 --> 01:34:33.909
How is -

01:34:35.916 --> 01:34:38.951
how are all the boys and
girls we used to know?

01:34:41.504 --> 01:34:43.580
Well -

01:34:44.549 --> 01:34:47.041
the Jenkins girls are married.

01:34:48.178 --> 01:34:50.882
Maldwyn Hughes has gone to be a doctor.

01:34:52.264 --> 01:34:57.603
Rhys Howell is in a solicitor's office,
and is sending home ten shillings a week.

01:34:59.397 --> 01:35:01.685
And Mr. Gruffydd...

01:35:01.774 --> 01:35:04.478
is still first up and last to bed.

01:35:06.487 --> 01:35:08.813
How is he, Huw?

01:35:08.906 --> 01:35:11.314
Not as he was.

01:35:12.618 --> 01:35:14.859
Is he ill?

01:35:14.953 --> 01:35:17.195
Inside.

01:35:17.289 --> 01:35:20.658
In his eyes and in his voice.

01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:26.417
Like you.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.840
Please go home, Huw.

01:35:38.727 --> 01:35:41.846
● I'm sorry.
● Now then, Mrs. Evans. Tea, is it?

01:35:52.949 --> 01:35:56.033
Leave it, Mrs. Nicholas. I will pour.

01:35:56.119 --> 01:35:58.029
Well.

01:35:58.121 --> 01:36:01.869
I always did the pouring for Mr.
Iestyn's poor mother.

01:36:03.042 --> 01:36:06.743
● I will pour.
● Yes, Mrs. Evans.

01:36:10.508 --> 01:36:12.881
A new mistress is like new sheets.

01:36:12.969 --> 01:36:16.088
Yes. A little bit stiff...

01:36:17.431 --> 01:36:19.923
but washing's to come.

01:36:22.353 --> 01:36:24.642
Why do you have her here?

01:36:26.105 --> 01:36:28.432
37 years with the family.

01:36:28.525 --> 01:36:30.684
Or so she tells me 60 times a day.

01:36:31.153 --> 01:36:34.273
● Have some tea, Huw.
● You don't want me to go?

01:36:36.325 --> 01:36:38.649
No. No, Huw.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.617
I'm sorry for being nasty.

01:36:41.705 --> 01:36:44.030
Please stay.

01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:48.127
Huw. I tried to tell Mother, but -

01:36:54.342 --> 01:36:56.715
Not for me to say.

01:36:56.803 --> 01:36:59.674
Only the housekeeper I am.

01:36:59.764 --> 01:37:02.302
37 years in the family...

01:37:02.392 --> 01:37:04.883
and living to curse the day.

01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:12.521
It will not surprise me any day to see
the old master rise from his grave.

01:37:14.653 --> 01:37:17.690
'Tis only the gravestone holding
him down, I will swear.

01:37:17.782 --> 01:37:20.189
Then what is it, Mrs. Nicholas?

01:37:34.465 --> 01:37:36.541
Divorce.

01:37:36.634 --> 01:37:39.089
Divorce.

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:45.807
Saying nothing, I am. But
that is what is in her mind.

01:37:46.686 --> 01:37:49.176
She is here without her husband, is it?

01:37:49.271 --> 01:37:53.518
And why? It is because she is
in love with this preacher.

01:37:55.736 --> 01:37:58.273
Preacher, I said. Mr. Gruffydd, it is.

01:37:58.363 --> 01:38:01.281
But Mr. Gruffydd has not
been near the house.

01:38:01.367 --> 01:38:03.987
What difference is that, girl?

01:38:04.077 --> 01:38:06.568
Get on with your work.

01:38:08.081 --> 01:38:10.537
We will not say a word, Mrs. Nicholas.

01:38:10.625 --> 01:38:12.702
No.

01:38:20.802 --> 01:38:23.293
You're a filthy liar!

01:38:32.938 --> 01:38:35.857
● Let up!
● Let me at him!

01:38:39.403 --> 01:38:41.480
Liar!

01:39:04.761 --> 01:39:07.466
<i>As the slag had spread over my valley...</i>

01:39:07.556 --> 01:39:11.934
<i>so now a blackness spread
over the minds of its people.</i>

01:39:12.019 --> 01:39:17.475
<i>For the first time in my memory, our front
door was shut tight in the daytime.</i>

01:39:35.166 --> 01:39:37.242
Dadda?

01:39:39.796 --> 01:39:41.954
Well, Huw?

01:39:42.048 --> 01:39:44.966
Trouble with the Philistines, is it?

01:39:45.051 --> 01:39:48.052
Huw, what is it now? Look at your hands.

01:39:50.847 --> 01:39:53.137
Evan John.

01:39:53.684 --> 01:39:58.013
He, he said things about
Angharad and Mr. Gruffydd.

01:39:59.983 --> 01:40:02.355
Children too.

01:40:06.239 --> 01:40:08.646
You were right, my son.

01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:23.662
● I will be back for breakfast.
● You will not go to chapel?

01:40:23.756 --> 01:40:25.832
No.

01:40:35.267 --> 01:40:38.268
And if they do this thing...

01:40:38.354 --> 01:40:42.303
I will never set foot in the
chapel again as long as I live.

01:40:43.316 --> 01:40:46.021
I will have the sheets warm on your bed.

01:40:48.029 --> 01:40:51.647
● There is an old beauty you are.
● Go and scratch, boy.

01:41:03.961 --> 01:41:06.499
What is this about the chapel, Mother?

01:41:07.757 --> 01:41:10.331
Tonight, after the service.

01:41:10.427 --> 01:41:13.214
A deacons' meeting over Angharad.

01:41:13.304 --> 01:41:16.672
Angharad? But she has done nothing.

01:41:16.765 --> 01:41:20.929
Nothing is enough for people
who have minds like cesspools.

01:41:22.813 --> 01:41:25.815
Huw, my little one.

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:30.276
I hope when you're grown, their
tongues will be slower to hurt.

01:41:31.989 --> 01:41:36.817
● Will Angharad have to be at the meeting?
● No. None of us will be there.

01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:39.532
But the disgrace will not stay away.

01:41:40.205 --> 01:41:42.660
I will go, Mother.

01:42:25.875 --> 01:42:29.825
This is the last time I
will talk in this chapel.

01:42:34.341 --> 01:42:37.592
I am leaving the valley with regret...

01:42:39.179 --> 01:42:42.300
toward those who have helped me here...

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.635
and who have let me help them.

01:42:50.275 --> 01:42:52.349
But...

01:42:54.027 --> 01:42:56.519
for the rest of you...

01:42:57.781 --> 01:43:02.941
those of you who have only proved that
I have wasted my time among you...

01:43:03.036 --> 01:43:05.788
I have only this to say.

01:43:05.872 --> 01:43:08.908
There is not one among you
who has had the courage...

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.334
to come to me and accuse me of wrongdoing.

01:43:12.421 --> 01:43:15.126
And yet, by any standard,
if there has been a sin...

01:43:15.215 --> 01:43:18.548
I am the one who should
be branded the sinner.

01:43:19.928 --> 01:43:23.510
Will anyone raise his voice
here now to accuse me?

01:43:27.269 --> 01:43:29.344
No.

01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:33.350
You're cowards, too, as well as hypocrites.

01:43:34.901 --> 01:43:37.771
But I don't blame you.

01:43:37.862 --> 01:43:41.065
The fault is mine as much as yours.

01:43:43.117 --> 01:43:45.323
The idle tongues...

01:43:46.204 --> 01:43:50.367
the poverty of mind which you have shown...

01:43:51.417 --> 01:43:56.838
mean that I have failed to reach most of
you with the lesson I was given to teach.

01:43:58.173 --> 01:44:00.250
Huw -

01:44:01.886 --> 01:44:07.591
I thought when I was a young man that I
would conquer the world, with truth.

01:44:09.768 --> 01:44:14.396
I thought I would lead an army greater
than Alexander ever dreamed of.

01:44:16.858 --> 01:44:21.770
Not to conquer nations,
but to liberate mankind.

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:24.980
● Yes, sir.
● With truth.

01:44:26.785 --> 01:44:29.074
With the golden sound of the Word.

01:44:30.914 --> 01:44:33.405
But only a few of them heard.

01:44:34.959 --> 01:44:37.747
Only a few of you understood.

01:44:38.714 --> 01:44:42.046
The rest of you put on
black and sat in chapel.

01:44:43.385 --> 01:44:45.710
Why do you come here?

01:44:46.763 --> 01:44:52.053
Why do you dress your hypocrisy in black
and parade before your God on Sunday?

01:44:52.685 --> 01:44:58.190
From love? No. For you've shown that
your hearts are too withered...

01:44:58.274 --> 01:45:01.061
to receive the love of your divine Father.

01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:04.278
I know why you've come.

01:45:04.363 --> 01:45:09.155
I've seen it in your faces Sunday after
Sunday as I've stood here before you.

01:45:09.243 --> 01:45:13.740
Fear has brought you here.
Horrible, superstitious fear.

01:45:13.831 --> 01:45:16.617
Fear of divine retribution.

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:20.170
A bolt of fire from the skies...

01:45:20.254 --> 01:45:24.002
the vengeance of the Lord,
and the justice of God.

01:45:27.011 --> 01:45:29.927
But you have forgotten the love of Jesus.

01:45:31.931 --> 01:45:34.423
You disregard his sacrifice.

01:45:36.145 --> 01:45:38.303
Death. Fear.

01:45:38.397 --> 01:45:43.817
Flames, horror, and black clothes.
Hold your meeting, then.

01:45:43.902 --> 01:45:47.734
But know if you do this in the name
of God, and in the house of God...

01:45:47.823 --> 01:45:50.740
you blaspheme against him and his Word.

01:45:56.664 --> 01:46:01.244
Wait. There is a meeting, Master Morgan.

01:46:17.309 --> 01:46:19.551
Well, Huw.

01:46:20.187 --> 01:46:22.975
● I'm glad you've come.
● Thank you, sir.

01:46:24.359 --> 01:46:26.932
Is there anything I can do?

01:46:27.028 --> 01:46:29.483
Indeed there is.

01:46:29.572 --> 01:46:32.062
You can do me a great service.

01:46:33.575 --> 01:46:36.149
This watch.

01:46:36.245 --> 01:46:39.579
My father gave it to me when
I entered the ministry.

01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:43.031
It's marked time we've both loved.

01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:47.339
● Take it.
● No, sir.

01:46:48.715 --> 01:46:51.385
A service, I said you'd be doing me.

01:46:53.511 --> 01:46:56.547
No need for us to shake hands.

01:46:56.739 --> 01:46:59.445
We will live in the minds of each other.

01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.524
Mr. Gruffydd, won't you see
Angharad before you go?

01:47:08.902 --> 01:47:11.309
She wants you to.

01:47:15.617 --> 01:47:17.692
No.

01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:21.361
If I were to see her again...

01:47:23.458 --> 01:47:26.543
I couldn't find the strength to leave her.

01:47:30.506 --> 01:47:32.582
Goodbye, Huw.

01:47:32.674 --> 01:47:35.297
And there's a good old man you are.

01:48:01.621 --> 01:48:04.194
What is it now? Fire, or flood, or what?

01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:06.447
A cave-in, they are saying.

01:48:06.641 --> 01:48:10.935
● Take me up there.
● What good in the darkness of a mine?

01:48:11.021 --> 01:48:14.769
Your eyes are no good in daylight from
the blows you've taken in the ring.

01:48:14.858 --> 01:48:19.815
I can still swing a pick deeper
than any man. Take me up there.

01:48:57.441 --> 01:49:02.234
Men. Men. Women. Those
of you with relatives.

01:49:02.321 --> 01:49:04.811
Let them to the pit.

01:49:09.494 --> 01:49:11.653
● Gwilym Morgan?
● Not yet, sir.

01:49:11.746 --> 01:49:14.499
Mr. Gruffydd. On the lower level, he was.

01:49:48.366 --> 01:49:50.857
● My father?
● Not yet, Mrs. Evans.

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:06.515
Angharad.

01:51:16.995 --> 01:51:19.567
Who is for Gwilym Morgan and the others?

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:23.705
I for one. He is the blood of my heart.

01:51:25.711 --> 01:51:27.954
Come, Cyfartha.

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:30.716
'Tis a coward I am.

01:51:30.799 --> 01:51:33.290
But I will hold your coat.

01:52:06.782 --> 01:52:08.782
Goodbye

01:52:56.174 --> 01:52:58.926
Dadda!

01:53:35.338 --> 01:53:37.829
Dadda!

01:53:52.272 --> 01:53:54.761
Dadda!

01:54:01.322 --> 01:54:03.648
Huw, lad.

01:54:18.255 --> 01:54:20.331
Dadda!

01:54:49.869 --> 01:54:52.194
● Dadda!
● Huw.

01:54:56.559 --> 01:54:58.634
Mr. Gruffydd!

01:55:05.885 --> 01:55:08.376
There's a good old man you are.

01:55:17.522 --> 01:55:20.011
He came to me just now.

01:55:20.565 --> 01:55:22.974
Ivor was with him.

01:55:24.194 --> 01:55:26.483
He spoke to me...

01:55:26.572 --> 01:55:29.408
and told me of the glory he had seen.

01:55:45.048 --> 01:55:47.124
Look.

01:56:36.849 --> 01:56:40.099
<i>Men like my father cannot die.</i>

01:56:40.286 --> 01:56:45.385
<i>They are with me still, real in
memory as they were in flesh...</i>

01:56:45.598 --> 01:56:48.386
<i>loving and beloved forever.</i>

01:56:48.477 --> 01:56:50.477
<i>How green was my valley then.</i>

01:56:51.305 --> 01:56:57.407
