<i>Relationships can be defined</i>
<i>by how long they are...</i>

00:08.960 --> 00:10.757
I'm late, I don't have time to eat.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.752
- <i>A few weeks...</i>
- Do you wanna have sex?

00:13.840 --> 00:15.159
Yes.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.593
- <i>... or three years.</i>
- Baby?

00:21.680 --> 00:25.036
What about getting
pregnant right after the wedding?

00:27.200 --> 00:28.792
See ya.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.958
You can't ask a guy
that while he's driving.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.359
My bad.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.276
Yes, it was your bad, Carla.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.590
<i>... or whether you've been together</i>
<i>for more than five years.</i>

00:48.680 --> 00:51.319
Why don't we ever have sex?

00:52.240 --> 00:54.356
I find it a little hard to feel sexy

00:54.440 --> 00:57.398
since I passed a human being
out of my body six months ago.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.553
I had ringside seats to that bloodbath.
It hadn't affected my sex drive.

01:01.640 --> 01:06.111
No, you asked the lactation nurse if
she needed help getting things started.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.599
Right.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.240
A lot of men would be happy
just to have a baby.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.677
- You're on the pill, right?
- Yes! Please just drop it.

01:14.760 --> 01:18.958
OK. You know you've gotta take it
the same time every day? Right.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.032
I went to Europe for a month
and forgot to take my pills.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.271
- I took 30 the day I got home.
- What happened?

01:26.240 --> 01:29.437
Elliot! Your homecoming date is here!

01:30.360 --> 01:32.271
Stall him!

01:36.920 --> 01:38.194
Nothing.

01:38.280 --> 01:43.035
Todd, you must sample one of these
tea buns my mum sent over from Sussex.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.069
Up high two times. Once for "buns,"
once for the 'sex' part of "Sussex."

01:48.160 --> 01:51.311
- Come on!
- An American high five!

01:52.960 --> 01:55.269
- How perfectly vulgar.
- Yeah.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.669
The Janitor's pretending to be British.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.637
You mean Klaus, the German guy?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.038
Thanks.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.151
- That means "nice hair cut".
- No, it doesn't.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.913
Mind your own beeswax.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.151
<i>I guess around here,</i>
<i>you have to be prepared for anything.</i>

02:14.240 --> 02:16.151
Britishy.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.432
<i>Especially when a patient</i>
<i>needs emergency surge</i> ry.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.239
Where's Dr Wen?
This patient's ready to go.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.834
<i>He got in a car accident,</i>
<i>so he can't make it.</i>

02:26.920 --> 02:29.309
Don't you play with me,
I will find you.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.119
<i>Relax, Dr DiStefano is on call.</i>

02:32.200 --> 02:36.398
Thank God.
We just dodged a bullet because...

02:36.480 --> 02:39.916
I am nowhere near ready
to perform this procedure solo.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.958
I'd have been terrified,
you'd have sensed it.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.429
It would've been horrible
for all of us.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.593
<i>Dr DiStefano is stuck in surge</i> ry.
<i>It's all on you, Dr Turk.</i>

02:49.680 --> 02:51.477
Piece of cake. Who's with me?

03:05.520 --> 03:08.478
<i>News of Turk's successful surge</i> ry
<i>had spread quickly.</i>

03:08.560 --> 03:10.232
<i>He was the stud of the hospital.</i>

03:12.760 --> 03:16.673
<i>Who's the black surgeon that</i>

03:16.760 --> 03:18.113
<i>Turk!</i>

03:18.200 --> 03:19.838
<i>That's right, baby</i>

03:19.920 --> 03:24.198
<i>Who is the doc that won't cop out</i>
<i>when no attendings are about?</i>

03:24.280 --> 03:25.872
<i>Turk!</i>

03:25.960 --> 03:27.473
<i>Right on</i>

03:27.560 --> 03:30.233
- <i>Turk!</i>
- What?

03:30.320 --> 03:33.756
You must be dancing
on the wind right now.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.910
That sounded straighter in my head.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.390
Today, I had to sink or swim
all on my own and guess what?

03:39.480 --> 03:42.631
- A brother swam.
- That is so fabulous.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.756
What is wrong with me today?

03:44.840 --> 03:47.434
Dr Wen, I was scared
when you didn't show up,

03:47.520 --> 03:51.149
but your car accident was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.151
My wife broke both her legs.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.514
Still.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.919
Maybe it's Buddha's way of
telling her to slow down a little.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.712
I hope you haven't eaten yet

04:07.800 --> 04:11.793
because I'm about to force feed you
a can of my homemade Whup-Ass.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.950
Miguel doesn't speak English, baby.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.956
Thanks, sweetness.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.472
Hey, Gandhi. Just because you broke out
your Fisher Price surgery set,

04:31.560 --> 04:35.678
and managed to not kill somebody,
doesn't mean you're queen of the world.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.957
- You can do better, old man?
- Watch and learn.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.717
How's that taste? Is it delicious?

05:00.720 --> 05:02.950
<i>Oh, Lord. My back.</i>

05:03.040 --> 05:05.395
- Are you OK?
- Come on.

05:05.480 --> 05:08.392
I'm posing so your boyfriend
can get a picture of me

05:08.480 --> 05:12.359
for his "People Who Make Me Feel
Like A Little Girl" scrapbook.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.317
Let's go.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.198
Oh, God.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.511
You know, Nigel, I'm 25% British.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.797
Really? I'm 100% not interested.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.351
Classic Nigel!

05:28.240 --> 05:31.710
I've been asking around and you're
known as one of three people.

05:31.800 --> 05:36.430
Nigel the Brit, Klaus the dim-witted
German... Yes, I said dim-witted.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.318
Or a simple, good-natured
stutterer named Efram.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.470
Am I the only one
that knows the real you?

05:41.560 --> 05:45.678
Who says this is the real me?
Perhaps this is.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.320
- Or this.
- Hey, Klaus.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.356
How come Hamburg and Frankfurt

05:50.440 --> 05:52.908
have nothing to do with
hamburgers or hotdogs?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.754
Why is your Lake Titicaca
not filled with boobs and poop?

05:59.160 --> 06:01.879
- What do you do?
- I work at a hospital.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.110
I'm a resident,
which is like a student.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.476
Not as in dorm rooms, pizza runs
and crazy drunken parties,

06:07.560 --> 06:11.155
which I know still go on in Radiology,
more of a student in the...

06:11.240 --> 06:13.754
Excuse me.
Dude, she's got a boyfriend.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.592
Thanks, man.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.635
Why didn't you tell him
you were a doctor?

06:18.720 --> 06:22.030
I guess I just still don't feel
like a doctor, you know?

06:22.120 --> 06:24.236
That thing with Turk got me thinking.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.029
I've ran codes before but there's
always been someone to bail me out.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.989
I've never had that one, defining,
sink-or-swim moment. Have you?

06:33.080 --> 06:36.277
Yeah, but I didn't like
make a big deal out of it.

06:39.240 --> 06:44.234
I was just made partner at my law firm,
I drive a Beamer, and this is my wife.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.279
This is Mr Booker.
He's alive because of me.

06:48.360 --> 06:53.354
- Thought you said there'd be bitches.
- We just got here. Look around.

06:53.440 --> 06:58.070
We had a fun night until he urinated
all over my rental car.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.599
So your mom made you
pancakes this morning

07:04.680 --> 07:08.309
and you didn't even know that
it was Pancake Day in the cafeteria?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.630
- Get outta here!
- The craziest thing...

07:10.720 --> 07:13.439
I'm serious, Nervous Guy.
Get outta here.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.275
Why won't you admit
you hurt your back?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.793
Carla, come on.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.509
Back injuries are for 80-year-olds
named Norman with pants to here,

07:22.600 --> 07:26.718
nose hairs to here, who start every
sentence with a very elegant...

07:30.840 --> 07:34.150
Oops! You dropped your badge.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.028
Your move, there... Norman.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.151
That's impressive.

08:15.640 --> 08:19.349
- Wanna know what the Janitor did today?
- No, Bambi, you idiot.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.830
<i>The Fugitive.</i> Would you sleep with
Tommy Lee Jones or Harrison Ford?

08:22.920 --> 08:25.354
Harrison Ford hands down.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.830
You were probably talking to Carla.
I'm having such a gay day.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.273
Day?

08:30.360 --> 08:33.033
This Janitor thing
has thrown me for a loop...

08:33.120 --> 08:37.193
We should watch in Turk's room.
He'll keep talking about the Janitor.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.635
I won't, sweetie. Trust me.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.119
Let's go.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.716
What kind of freak spends all day
pretending to be somebody else?

08:46.560 --> 08:52.829
<i>Transit Unit 23. I got a possible</i>
<i>sighting of Richard Kimble, northbound.</i>

08:53.640 --> 08:55.312
<i>Kimble!</i>

08:58.440 --> 09:00.510
Janitor.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.591
I don't want to make any promises

09:02.680 --> 09:06.389
but your cellulitis is resolving.
You'll be out of the woods soon.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.233
Tell me something.
How did an old geezer like me

09:09.320 --> 09:12.278
end up with the prettiest
young doctor in the place?

09:12.360 --> 09:16.558
It's based on when your shift started
and the last patient you've seen...

09:16.640 --> 09:20.030
Sweetheart, I'm just
paying you a compliment.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.273
I have to go.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.912
Thanks for saying I'm pre <i>tty</i>.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.034
Oh, yeah. Hello, sweet...

09:32.120 --> 09:34.236
...sweet couch.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.833
I've been thinking about
what you said this morning,

09:40.920 --> 09:44.754
and you're right, we have not
been having enough sex lately.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.115
Turns out, yes... Yes, we have.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.079
We haven't. Tonight we're doing
it the way you always fantasized about.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.720
Laying down in a big tub of ice?

09:53.800 --> 09:59.238
Standing up against the wall, you
holding me up. What do you say, Romeo?

09:59.320 --> 10:04.394
<i>Sometimes the moment you've waited for</i>
<i>comes at the most inopportune time.</i>

10:04.480 --> 10:06.755
Let's do this.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.518
Oh, yeah.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.638
<i>Sometimes the moment comes when you</i>
<i>feel like you've waited your whole life.</i>

10:17.720 --> 10:20.518
<i>You just have to hope that</i>
<i>no one steals your thunder.</i>

10:20.600 --> 10:25.037
<i>If they do, you'll just end up</i>
<i>standing in the corner, watching.</i>

10:25.120 --> 10:26.439
Complete heart block.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.398
Transcutaneous pads, atropine.
Where's the cart?

10:29.480 --> 10:30.469
Elliot.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.710
They're trying to get through.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.509
Start a line.
Hyperventilate. Here we go.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.160
You're not going anywhere.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.879
Dr Dorian, you can't imagine
how grateful we are.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.916
Who's the cool doc you call

10:54.000 --> 10:56.195
When you want to save
your husband Paul?

10:56.280 --> 10:57.713
JD.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.350
It's from <i>Shaft.</i>
How could you guys not get that?

11:02.440 --> 11:07.992
Yeah, that's our <i>Citizen Kane.</i> Anyway,
thanks again. You're a real hero.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.834
Oh, please, I put my pants on
one leg at a time, just like you.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.992
Except after I put my pants on,
I save your husband's life.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.914
Oh, no, he didn't!
Smelliot, what's the happy-hap?

11:28.720 --> 11:32.030
I was in a sex coma.
How'd you sleep?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.473
Great.

11:34.560 --> 11:38.712
Oh, and Perry, I know I asked you
to be more sensitive when we do it,

11:38.800 --> 11:41.234
but I was hoping
you wouldn't curse as much.

11:41.320 --> 11:45.393
I mean, to actually cry during sex,
what's that about?

11:45.480 --> 11:49.155
I guess I just love you so much.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.193
What is wrong? Is it because
I called you Smelliot?

11:55.280 --> 11:56.918
You haven't heard that before?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.515
- I don't care if you call me that.
- She's cool with Smelliot.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.797
He can call you Smelliot
but I can't call you Vagina-face?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.996
Not the same, Todd.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.198
Look, that was my patient. I was
one step behind you and you knew it.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.590
- You stole my moment.
- This is about saving lives.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.956
- When I put my pants...
- I don't want to hear about your pants.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.996
We both know what this is about.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.152
From the second I started dating Sean,
you weren't happy.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.073
I thought that would change,
but I've moved on and...

12:25.160 --> 12:27.276
...you're just acting like you have.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.555
OK. Prepare for a storm-off.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.635
The night we got engaged,
you said you couldn't wait to have kids.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.234
You can't hold that against me.
You were naked.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.551
So I should just disregard
everything you say when I'm naked?

12:43.640 --> 12:47.679
You know that's not actually a bad idea.
We can call it the naked rule.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.591
It should apply retroactively

12:49.680 --> 12:52.592
so... can you get yourself
to the airport next weekend?

12:52.680 --> 12:53.999
Fine.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.071
Gotta love the naked rule.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.598
Say, Carla. You look nice.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.193
You're pathetic.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.875
How's about we skip the insults
and you do something helpful like...

13:13.960 --> 13:17.316
...prop me up, or throw on a skirt?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.150
- You're an actor.
- You're a fireman.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.276
- What are we doing?
- Game over, Klaus.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.839
I saw you in <i>The Fugitive.</i>

13:28.920 --> 13:34.119
Oh, yeah. I was in a Harrison Ford
movie, but I chose this life instead.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.918
It's a little more glamorous.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.551
Hey, champ. There's some vomit
on the back steps with your name on it.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.473
That's my cue. Action!

13:48.760 --> 13:50.239
Cut.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.710
Young lady, would it
brighten your day any if I told you

13:53.800 --> 13:57.839
I thought you were the best damn doctor
in this hospital?

13:57.920 --> 14:00.354
Why couldn't my father
be more like you?

14:00.440 --> 14:04.513
If I had a dollar when I got depressed
and my dad didn't make me feel better...

14:04.600 --> 14:07.990
Actually, he did give me a dollar
every time I got depressed.

14:08.080 --> 14:13.598
By the end of junior high I had $170
and then got mugged and lost it all.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.558
By the end of that night,
I was back up to a dollar.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.598
Why don't you tell me
what's really upsetting you?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.559
Him.

14:23.640 --> 14:27.315
She says I beat her to that code
because I have feelings for her.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.197
I don't think about her that way.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.316
You can't not think about her that way.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.994
- Whatever.
- Think about her right now.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.513
Now think about her and Sean together.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.428
Now think about her and me together.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.113
That's what's up.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.431
Kissing her each time except
the third time you were black?

14:57.520 --> 14:58.748
Yeah.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.638
Let me do it... OK.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.280
You are entering
a new phase in your life.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.670
- Why are you fighting it?
- I'm not. I'm not fighting anything.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.990
So even though you have
a full head of hair,

15:10.080 --> 15:13.072
you take Propecia because
you like the way it tastes?

15:13.160 --> 15:18.359
The other day,
I found a grey hair in my happy trail.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.159
Is that the hair from
your belly button to your peep?

15:21.240 --> 15:24.118
- It is indeed.
- So you have a grey happy trail.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.191
A lot of women find it distinguished.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.918
I have a six month old child.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.470
I'm gonna be one of those weird old guys
who brings my son to the park

15:31.560 --> 15:34.836
where everybody is like,
"Is he the dad? Is he the granddad?"

15:34.920 --> 15:37.309
"Is he the granddad's granddad?
Oh, my God,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.755
why is he pushing
a traffic cone on the swing

15:39.840 --> 15:42.559
while his five-year-old boy
is in the mud crying?"

15:42.640 --> 15:45.108
"Is he taunting the little boy? No."

15:45.200 --> 15:47.760
"He can't even see the little boy.
And now look,

15:47.840 --> 15:51.150
he's putting the traffic cone
in the minivan and driving away,

15:51.240 --> 15:54.789
while the little boy cries
and the traffic cone sits quietly

15:54.880 --> 15:57.155
and watches <i>Finding Nemo</i> on DVD."

16:01.040 --> 16:05.909
For what it's worth, instead of marrying
a long time ago, I'm marrying a guy

16:06.000 --> 16:10.118
who probably won't be ready to have kids
for another ten years.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.590
That'll make me like thirty...

16:13.680 --> 16:15.750
More like forty...

16:15.840 --> 16:17.831
But you know what?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.675
It's OK. Because I couldn't handle
marriage until now.

16:22.760 --> 16:26.469
I knew you when you were younger and
you would have been a horrible dad.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.790
Now, we're both ready.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.394
Do you think that my son will like me?

16:32.480 --> 16:33.993
Oh, God, no.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.029
Dr Reid, I need to get Enid
a birthday present.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.396
- When's her birthday?
- I think it was last week.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.476
Well, a scarf is always nice.

16:47.560 --> 16:52.031
It's perfect. It's simple, it's elegant,
and it'll hide her turkey neck.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.313
- Mr Moran is coding.
- Dr Reid...

17:07.760 --> 17:12.992
<i>Medicine's pretty competitive so I guess</i>
<i>you have to do whatever's right for you.</i>

17:14.520 --> 17:15.589
Go.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.877
Start a central line.
Detach and get the crash cart.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.713
- Have we established an airway?
- It's obstructed.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.109
We need to do an emergency trach,
get the scalpel and trach kit.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.835
<i>Watching Elliot in there,</i>
<i>I couldn't help but be impressed.</i>

17:30.920 --> 17:33.673
- Hurry, faster.
- <i>She was amazing.</i>

17:33.760 --> 17:38.151
<i>Unfortunately, in medicine,</i>
<i>even if you do everything perfectly...</i>

17:41.640 --> 17:44.029
<i>... there are still no guarantees.</i>

17:47.360 --> 17:48.679
Sorry.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.033
Evenin', Guv'nor.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.670
What's up your bum?

18:05.760 --> 18:08.593
You know why I wanted
that to be you in <i>The Fugitive?</i>

18:08.680 --> 18:12.070
It would mean you used to be a guy
who had dreams and ambitions,

18:12.160 --> 18:16.119
and though things didn't work out,
it'd explain why you're the way you are,

18:16.200 --> 18:17.679
and make you human.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.558
Instead, it turns out you're
nothing more than a jerk

18:20.640 --> 18:23.438
who likes to mess with people
for no reason.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.719
Kimble!

18:30.760 --> 18:33.115
You tell anybody, I'll kill you.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.194
Good night, Efram.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.070
Good night, Doctor.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.839
<i>Some people hide</i>
<i>from who they really are.</i>

18:44.200 --> 18:46.430
Baby, Todd and I
are going to the arcade.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.318
I'm going to get some quarters
out your purse.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.114
I'm old.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.589
<i>Others eventually accept who they are.</i>

18:54.680 --> 18:57.592
I'm older. Would you please
get me down to my damn car?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.434
Sure. Let's get
your big Irish ass to your car

19:01.520 --> 19:06.116
so nobody knows you hurt your back.
Let's not worry about my back.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.871
<i>Sometimes it's the tough moments</i>

19:09.960 --> 19:13.396
<i>that help you realise</i>
<i>who you've finally become.</i>

19:14.800 --> 19:17.030
You work in there?

19:17.120 --> 19:18.872
What do you do?

19:18.960 --> 19:21.520
I'm a doctor.
You shouldn't smoke.
