WEBVTT

01:44.554 --> 01:47.056
Go on. I ain't got nothin'. Psst!

02:23.844 --> 02:25.594
Sweet Jesus!

02:30.267 --> 02:32.893
Oh, God! No! No! No!

04:50.949 --> 04:54.535
Yeah,
this is definitely our campsite.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.002
- So...
- So we're here. Come on.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.086
Can you help me with this?

05:07.799 --> 05:11.219
Here. Over there, by the fire pit.

05:11.219 --> 05:14.389
- Oh, here, here, here, here.
- Oh, yeah. You need that.

05:14.389 --> 05:16.474
Need the hatchet.

05:28.236 --> 05:31.782
- Thank you for doing this.
- I was made for camping.

05:31.782 --> 05:33.909
- This is, like, my thing.
- Hm-hm.

05:33.909 --> 05:36.619
- What? Oh, really?
- Hm-hm.

05:37.621 --> 05:39.915
- You know what?
- What?

05:39.915 --> 05:42.542
- I think I'm gonna like camping.
- Yeah?

05:42.542 --> 05:44.627
- Hm-hm.
- I told you.

05:47.255 --> 05:49.340
Ow! Wait a minute.

05:51.051 --> 05:55.514
- Did you get the bug stuff?
- Come on. Let's get this tent up.

05:55.514 --> 05:57.598
Come on.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.150
Shit, shit, shit.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.698
- The engine's fucking destroyed.
- This ain't how you talked it, D.

06:12.698 --> 06:16.785
Mexico is just around the corner,
sweetheart. Come on.

06:16.785 --> 06:18.620
It's not.

06:18.620 --> 06:22.707
Well, this truck ain't getting us
any closer, alright? Let's go.

06:27.337 --> 06:30.298
- Mine's in.
- It can't be. I... Hold on.

06:30.298 --> 06:33.051
- Well, just hold that. Just trust me.
- OK.

06:33.051 --> 06:35.971
- Hey, got it.
- OK, mine's in.

06:35.971 --> 06:38.640
Ow! Well, now mine's not.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.475
- Are you OK?
- This is...

06:40.475 --> 06:44.104
- Are you sure you got the right hole?
- OK, is this the right pole?

06:44.104 --> 06:48.066
- Look how short that pole is.
- Yeah, it's... Yeah.

06:48.066 --> 06:50.861
I'm starting to think
we're not wilderness people.

06:50.861 --> 06:54.531
Of course we are.
We can't let this tent beat us, OK?

06:54.531 --> 06:58.326
You always say we have to be smarter
than what we're working against.

06:58.326 --> 07:01.121
You know what I'm definitely
smarter than? A motel.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.583
No. You can't see the stars
from a motel. And that wasn't the deal.

07:04.583 --> 07:08.377
The deal was anniversary sex
under the stars.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.089
OK, that part sounds kind of familiar.

07:13.383 --> 07:15.634
Alright, hold your end.
I'll get this in.

07:18.597 --> 07:20.599
- OK.
- You ready? You got it?

07:20.599 --> 07:21.849
OK.

07:26.938 --> 07:28.147
Oh!

07:29.316 --> 07:31.485
Are you kidding me?

07:31.485 --> 07:33.736
Tell me you remembered the spare tent.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.034
No.

07:39.034 --> 07:41.787
Come here. Come here.

07:41.787 --> 07:45.164
Motel. Motel. Motel.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.626
Come on. Come on!

07:50.712 --> 07:52.588
OK.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.559
What are you doing?

08:08.021 --> 08:10.690
Hey, D. That's all our stuff.

08:10.690 --> 08:15.278
We're getting all new stuff, baby.
All new stuff.

08:15.278 --> 08:18.281
Hey, who's the cowgirl, huh?

08:18.281 --> 08:20.866
I fucking hate it when you call me that.

08:23.537 --> 08:27.207
Hey, there's my cowgirl. There she is.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.666
Let's go.

08:30.669 --> 08:35.131
Just gotta hang on a little while
longer. We're almost fucking there.

08:37.842 --> 08:40.636
Who's my lady Lacey, huh?

08:40.636 --> 08:46.308
There you are, baby. Just gotta hang on
a little while fucking longer, alright?

08:50.981 --> 08:55.777
- Do you realise how old this forest is?
- No. Please tell me.

08:55.777 --> 09:01.825
The whole area mostly sucks for logging,
so these trees are completely untouched.

09:01.825 --> 09:04.411
Some of them are 400 years old,
maybe more.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.873
- Really?
- They just grow older and older.

09:07.873 --> 09:12.377
You know, if you spent half as much time
in nature as you do reading
about it,

09:12.377 --> 09:15.714
we'd be cuddling
under the stars tonight.

09:15.714 --> 09:17.798
Cuddling.

09:18.717 --> 09:20.801
Hey, come on.

09:22.721 --> 09:28.935
Now we get to spend our anniversary
basking in the glow of free cable TV.

09:28.935 --> 09:32.439
Next year we're camping.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.023
- Alright.
- OK.

10:03.011 --> 10:07.099
See that tree right there? That's a post
oak, a 300-year-old tree at
least.

10:07.099 --> 10:10.102
Baby, could we please
just have a moment of silence,

10:10.102 --> 10:12.938
you know, to mourn the loss of our tent?

10:12.938 --> 10:16.274
OK. Look at the positives here
for two seconds. Just go with me.

10:16.274 --> 10:18.819
- OK.
- We get to stay at a ghetto-ass motel.

10:18.819 --> 10:22.364
There's gonna be bugs everywhere.
The AC will probably be broken.

10:22.364 --> 10:26.243
It's gonna be every bit as uncomfortable
as sleeping in the wilderness.

10:26.243 --> 10:29.955
- So why are you complaining?
- Will there be holes in the sheets?

10:29.955 --> 10:32.708
We won't stop
until we find a place that does.

10:32.708 --> 10:36.502
- Or I'll poke holes in them myself.
- I love you.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.882
Oh! Look at that tree. That's gotta be
at least 400 years old, right?

10:40.882 --> 10:43.593
- Look how big that one is.
- That's an old tree.

10:43.593 --> 10:47.973
I'd say closer to 100 or 200.
See it has stumps halfway up?

10:47.973 --> 10:51.268
You're gonna laugh at me?
You're gonna laugh at me when I'm...

10:51.268 --> 10:54.563
I think you're cute.
It's adorable when you talk about trees.

10:54.563 --> 10:57.273
I'm not gonna talk about 'em any more.

11:01.319 --> 11:02.653
What the?

11:08.535 --> 11:09.577
Did you?

11:10.245 --> 11:14.708
- What's she doing out here by herself?
- She looks... not right.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.169
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- Hm.

11:17.169 --> 11:20.588
- She's coming up here.
- I don't know. I think it's weird.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.092
- It's OK. Go.
- Maybe he's with her.

11:24.092 --> 11:25.801
- No, thank you.
- I don't know.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.308
- Oh, my God, Seth.
- Are you fucking deaf?

11:33.143 --> 11:36.229
- Whoa, whoa!
- Out of the fucking car now. Out.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.774
- Baby, no!
- We're good, baby. We're good.

11:38.774 --> 11:41.985
Turn it off. Get out of the car.

11:41.985 --> 11:45.072
Nice and easy, alright?
Get out of the car.

11:45.072 --> 11:49.158
- Just... Just...
- Get out of the fucking car now!

11:50.202 --> 11:51.370
- Oh, God!
- OK, OK.

11:51.370 --> 11:53.413
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.041
Clear the back seat.
Make room for two more.

11:56.041 --> 11:59.002
No, D, you can't change the plan.
You said no hostages.

11:59.002 --> 12:01.963
I know what I said, baby.
I know what I said. Listen to me.

12:01.963 --> 12:04.591
Plat's 40 miles up the road.

12:04.591 --> 12:08.136
The bank's closed. It don't open
till 8am. Listen to me. Trust me.

12:08.136 --> 12:11.348
We're gonna do this right.
Come here. Come here.

12:11.348 --> 12:14.768
Listen to me. You gotta trust me, OK?
You trust me? You trust me?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.353
OK, give me a kiss.

12:23.318 --> 12:27.822
OK, go get in the front seat.
Let's go, kid.

12:30.033 --> 12:32.202
That's twice.

12:32.202 --> 12:34.286
OK.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.418
- Up.
- Oh, God. God.

12:39.418 --> 12:42.045
- You, around the front. Drive.
- I can drive.

12:42.045 --> 12:45.507
- I wasn't talking to you. Drive.
- What? I can't...

12:45.507 --> 12:48.592
- Drive the fucking car!
- I can't drive stick, OK?

12:51.346 --> 12:53.849
Fuck! Get in the fucking car.

12:53.849 --> 12:57.269
Hands on the wheel,
off the fucking locks.

12:57.269 --> 13:00.188
You, in back, over here.
Lacey's up front.

13:00.188 --> 13:02.648
Go on. Step in there, Lacey.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.527
Get in the fucking car.

13:05.527 --> 13:08.195
Everybody nice and fucking comfy now?

13:16.288 --> 13:18.749
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah. I'm cold.

13:18.749 --> 13:22.752
OK, OK. Just relax, just relax.
Let's go.

13:25.464 --> 13:28.633
- OK, OK.
- What's the problem? Yeah? OK?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.718
OK. Uh-uh.

13:45.817 --> 13:47.985
Wallets and cellphone, give 'em up.

13:53.158 --> 13:57.621
- Same page, friend?
- Seth, just give him the damn thing.

13:57.621 --> 14:00.331
Yeah, just give it to me, Seth.

14:08.632 --> 14:13.094
Jesus. Five bucks?
Don't anybody carry cash any more?

14:19.893 --> 14:24.605
Here, baby. Take that. See if you can
find anything for you in there.

14:28.318 --> 14:31.320
Seth Turner. Polly Watt.

14:32.447 --> 14:36.867
Same address, different names.
Hm. Not married?

14:37.536 --> 14:40.789
- Living together in sin?
- Come on, Dennis.

14:40.789 --> 14:43.082
That ain't your business, now.

14:45.544 --> 14:47.712
Student ID. A little old, ain't you?

14:49.715 --> 14:52.217
- It's a PhD.
- Oh.

14:52.217 --> 14:55.095
- You a doctor?
- Not yet, no.

14:55.095 --> 14:59.558
- But you can do script, huh?
- What?

14:59.558 --> 15:05.480
- Can you write prescriptions?
- No. No, it's a biology PhD.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.399
- Lacey.
- OK. Then you ain't a fucking doctor.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.028
Great.

15:11.028 --> 15:12.653
Not yet.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.199
Where are we going?

15:16.199 --> 15:21.079
Just drive till I say different.
This is a dictatorship from here on
out.

15:21.079 --> 15:23.497
If you wanna make life easy,
don't talk no more.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.837
Shit, what was that?

15:28.837 --> 15:30.589
- We hit something.
- What?

15:30.589 --> 15:33.175
Ginger. Ginger.

15:33.175 --> 15:36.261
- Ginger? Ginger's dead, baby.
- We've got a flat tyre.

15:36.261 --> 15:39.973
- What the fuck are you trying to do?
- Relax, Lacey. It's gonna be fine.

15:39.973 --> 15:43.685
- Get the spare. You.
- Er...

15:43.685 --> 15:47.438
- Get the spare!
- I'll get it. It's not his car.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.399
It's not my car.

15:51.693 --> 15:56.280
You know, you suffer from
a severe case of CDS. Can't do shit.

16:03.663 --> 16:08.167
You think Ginger's OK?
She's just a puppy. Huh?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.340
Hurry up.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.473
Here. Hey, if he moves, shoot him.

16:29.564 --> 16:32.233
Hey, let's go.

16:33.985 --> 16:35.986
OK.

16:41.493 --> 16:43.577
Go.

16:58.969 --> 17:00.010
Ginger.

17:12.523 --> 17:14.608
Ginger.

17:14.608 --> 17:17.779
OK. It's OK.

17:17.779 --> 17:20.741
Momma's here now.
It's gonna be OK, Ginger.

17:20.741 --> 17:23.743
OK. You... You gotta help her.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.203
- Please.
- You...

17:25.203 --> 17:28.873
- Come on, Biology. Ginger needs you.
- OK. I'm...

17:29.833 --> 17:33.002
I'm pretty sure it's dead.

17:42.095 --> 17:45.347
Here, make this quick. Fit this tyre.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.018
Grab that.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.736
Ah! Damn.

17:59.571 --> 18:01.655
What the?

18:17.672 --> 18:19.966
You're gonna help her.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.051
- Come on.
- OK. OK.

18:24.429 --> 18:25.763
OK.

18:33.814 --> 18:38.901
It's OK. No, it's OK, lovely.
He's a doctor.

18:39.569 --> 18:42.280
I don't care what Dennis says, OK, baby?

18:42.280 --> 18:45.783
We're gonna take you home, OK?
We're gonna save you.

18:46.827 --> 18:50.162
What is wrong with her?

18:56.044 --> 18:58.671
- I don't know what...
- Hey, fix it.

18:59.548 --> 19:01.632
Alright. Alright.

19:10.809 --> 19:13.978
See these? I don't...

19:14.980 --> 19:17.314
What is that?

19:18.984 --> 19:21.986
Holy shit! Holy motherfucker!

19:26.033 --> 19:29.410
- Seth!
- Get that thing on the ground. Lacey!

19:31.580 --> 19:34.291
- Baby.
- What happened? You OK? Talk to me.

19:34.291 --> 19:38.210
- Shut up!
- Talk to me. Talk to me, Lacey.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.381
- Lacey.
- Get in. Get in!

19:41.381 --> 19:43.966
- Did he mess with you?
- Get in! D, get in.

19:47.637 --> 19:51.516
- Get in the car.
- Seth! Seth!

19:51.516 --> 19:53.184
Ah, fuck!

19:54.895 --> 19:57.564
- What happened?
- We gotta get out of here.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.941
- Drive this fucking car!
- What happened?

19:59.941 --> 20:02.235
- I'm not leaving him.
- Oh, fuck! Drive!

20:02.235 --> 20:05.655
- I'm not leaving him.
- Fuck! Come on. Go!

20:05.655 --> 20:08.908
Go, go. OK. Go, go! Drive!

20:21.588 --> 20:23.924
Speed up.

20:23.924 --> 20:27.094
I will blow a hole in you
big enough to watch TV through.

20:27.094 --> 20:30.347
- Fucking stop!
- Tell me what's happened, Lace.

20:30.347 --> 20:33.016
What happened back there, hm?

20:33.016 --> 20:35.852
She tried to get me.

20:35.852 --> 20:37.937
- Who?
- Ginger.

20:39.022 --> 20:42.693
- She attacked me with her tail.
- It wasn't Ginger, baby.

20:42.693 --> 20:46.195
- Yeah.
- It was some critter from the woods.

20:47.739 --> 20:50.241
Ginger's dead, sweetheart.

20:51.993 --> 20:54.495
You gotta let her go.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.959
God.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.549
Did you see anything back there?

21:09.886 --> 21:13.305
When was the last time
you took a hit, Lace? Huh?

21:15.016 --> 21:17.060
- It's not that, D.
- Tell me.

21:17.060 --> 21:19.479
D, I swear to God, it's not that.

21:19.479 --> 21:23.900
Hey, I saw some crazy shit.
First two days, I saw shit coming...

21:23.900 --> 21:26.527
Baby, it's not that.

21:28.280 --> 21:33.493
OK? I ain't had a hit
since day before yesterday.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.996
I ain't seeing a goddamn thing.

21:35.996 --> 21:39.416
She tried to get you with her tail, huh?

21:39.416 --> 21:41.543
Fine. I'm gonna straighten you out.

21:41.543 --> 21:45.588
I promise you, if that's the last thing
I do, I'm gonna straighten you out.

21:46.548 --> 21:51.135
I'm gonna get you to Mexico, get you
drinks with fucking umbrellas in 'em.

21:55.724 --> 21:58.726
Motherfuckin' radiator. Fuck!

22:09.613 --> 22:13.407
One sure thing about luck is,
it will change.

22:15.077 --> 22:16.285
Pull over.

22:32.761 --> 22:35.305
- Hey, where are you going?
- Bathroom.

22:35.305 --> 22:38.058
Just hold it.
It's only 30 miles to Platt.

22:38.058 --> 22:39.517
I need to go.

22:41.686 --> 22:44.314
You told me
you were gonna lay off the stuff.

22:44.314 --> 22:46.691
And you told me fuckin' Mexico.

22:47.818 --> 22:50.779
I just don't want you
getting cockeyed on me.

22:50.779 --> 22:55.325
This whole fucking world is cockeyed.
I'm not gonna make a fuckin' difference.

22:55.325 --> 22:57.410
Leave it.

23:13.844 --> 23:16.137
Turn it off.

23:21.101 --> 23:23.602
Tell me you can pump gas.

23:25.313 --> 23:30.568
Let's go. Polly Watt,
we're going to buy coolant and crackers.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.295
Keep a cool hand, Luke.

23:59.890 --> 24:01.974
Hello?

24:12.069 --> 24:15.530
Come on, come on. Fucking... Come on.

24:15.530 --> 24:16.989
Come on.

24:18.325 --> 24:20.535
OK. Come on, you fucking door!

24:20.535 --> 24:22.411
Fuck!

24:23.872 --> 24:25.956
Hello?

24:43.767 --> 24:45.643
Fuck!

25:06.331 --> 25:07.540
Hello?

25:17.134 --> 25:19.635
They're making this easy, huh?

25:34.026 --> 25:36.277
Fuck!

25:43.076 --> 25:45.745
- Sorry. I didn't...
- Kill me.

25:53.545 --> 25:57.090
Baby? Baby! Baby!

25:57.090 --> 26:00.426
- What's going on?
- There's a man with spikes.

26:01.803 --> 26:04.181
- Spikes?
- No, no, no, no, baby, please.

26:04.181 --> 26:06.892
- Just listen!
- Do you even hear yourself talking?

26:06.892 --> 26:11.145
Baby, in the bathroom, there's a man!
He's fucking...

26:11.813 --> 26:14.399
What the fuck?

26:14.399 --> 26:16.777
Lacey, get back. Lacey, get back!

26:16.777 --> 26:18.611
Lacey!

26:21.573 --> 26:23.282
Run!

26:23.992 --> 26:25.618
Fuck!

26:27.579 --> 26:30.331
Seth! Seth! Seth!

26:31.083 --> 26:33.876
Run! Run! Hurry! Seth!

26:35.504 --> 26:37.171
Get inside!

26:42.177 --> 26:45.304
- Lacey!
- Are you OK? What was that?

26:46.515 --> 26:51.394
- It just tore right through her.
- Oh, shit! Lacey!

26:54.064 --> 26:56.316
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

26:56.316 --> 26:59.736
No, no, no, no! What are you doing?

26:59.736 --> 27:03.657
Don't think what's happening out there
changes who we are in here.

27:03.657 --> 27:08.787
- You going to prison bothers me?
- I coulÐ¿ve killed you. I didn't.

27:08.787 --> 27:12.581
Yeah. We see how well
that worked out for you, don't we?

27:17.754 --> 27:20.965
Stupid fuckin' idiot.
Plans don't change.

27:21.883 --> 27:24.052
Hey, man.

27:24.052 --> 27:26.220
You ain't no hero, kid.
We both know that.

27:34.271 --> 27:36.439
- Let me see.
- I'm OK.

27:44.906 --> 27:47.074
Are you OK?

27:49.745 --> 27:51.203
Fuck!

28:07.471 --> 28:10.306
Are you OK? Let me see.

29:01.358 --> 29:04.111
What are you doing? Hey. Stop it.

29:04.111 --> 29:06.530
She's alive.

29:06.530 --> 29:09.199
Are you nuts?
You can't open that door, OK?

29:09.199 --> 29:12.451
She's alive. Look.
I can't leave her out there.

29:20.377 --> 29:23.754
No. She's...

29:25.048 --> 29:27.633
Alright.

29:30.137 --> 29:35.225
We'll watch the monitor, make sure
that thing on the car doesn't move.

29:35.225 --> 29:38.018
You wanna tell me the rest?

29:39.062 --> 29:45.193
Well, if...
if it goes to get you or whatever,

29:45.193 --> 29:49.613
we're gonna shut that door, we're gonna
lock it and it's gonna stay shut.

29:58.999 --> 30:00.249
You're OK.

30:29.696 --> 30:33.700
- We can lock him out.
- He's got a gun.

30:33.700 --> 30:37.245
- He can shoot through glass.
- Yeah, but he's out of bullets.

30:37.245 --> 30:40.414
- It takes six, right?
- I don't know.

30:43.627 --> 30:45.712
The girl shot two.
How many did he shoot?

30:45.712 --> 30:47.254
What if he has more bullets? No.

31:06.775 --> 31:10.027
Baby? Are you alright here, baby?

31:11.113 --> 31:14.949
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

31:16.326 --> 31:17.743
There you go. There you go.

31:19.287 --> 31:22.124
- Seth, he's gonna kill us.
- Look, OK.

31:22.124 --> 31:24.126
Just statistically speaking,

31:24.126 --> 31:27.504
most people survive hostage situations
if you just stay calm.

31:27.504 --> 31:29.798
Stay calm!

31:29.798 --> 31:34.051
I'm just gonna take you inside,
alright? OK?

31:34.928 --> 31:37.139
Just stay still. Stay still.

31:37.139 --> 31:39.265
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

31:40.058 --> 31:44.729
Jesus. She's dead.
He's completely insane.

31:45.856 --> 31:51.027
OK, alright, I'm just gonna
drag you inside. Here we go.

31:55.657 --> 31:56.949
Oh, my God.

32:03.415 --> 32:06.418
- Come on.
- Polly, here he comes, OK?

32:06.418 --> 32:10.172
Polly, open the door. We're gonna
get through this. Just be calm.

32:10.172 --> 32:12.506
- You don't know that.
- Polly.

32:15.260 --> 32:18.055
- Seth...
- Open the door.

32:18.055 --> 32:21.308
- Open the door!
- Let him in. Polly, let him in.

32:21.308 --> 32:23.894
- She's alive! Open the door!
- It's OK.

32:23.894 --> 32:27.606
Open the door. He's right there!
Open the fucking door.

32:27.606 --> 32:30.400
One!

32:30.400 --> 32:33.612
- Two.
- It's OK. It's OK. No, no, no.

32:33.612 --> 32:36.156
Three.

32:36.156 --> 32:39.325
Don't! It's attacking him!
Don't open it!

32:45.999 --> 32:50.669
No! What is?
Seth, what is? What is that?

32:54.049 --> 32:56.343
Get away from it.

32:56.343 --> 32:59.637
Seth, come on, man.

33:00.806 --> 33:04.975
It's moving.
It's actually moving itself.

33:07.270 --> 33:09.271
It's going for the blood.

33:21.410 --> 33:23.911
- Don't. Come on. Don't.
- Wait.

33:38.260 --> 33:41.053
You see this? It's following me.

33:41.972 --> 33:44.265
It's actually following me.

33:45.392 --> 33:47.226
Look at this.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.151
Do you see that? It's... It's...

33:57.279 --> 33:59.905
It's f...

34:02.659 --> 34:05.037
It's metabolising.

34:05.037 --> 34:06.537
What?

34:07.664 --> 34:11.752
I can't believe this. I think
it's feeding. It's digesting the blood.

34:11.752 --> 34:15.755
See the black stuff right there?
I think that's the waste.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.967
- It was eating her?
- No.

34:18.967 --> 34:23.847
It's absorbing...
the nutrients on a cellular...

34:23.847 --> 34:26.475
It's more like a mould, I think.

34:26.475 --> 34:28.851
What are you saying?
It feeds on people?

34:28.851 --> 34:31.772
No. It probably feeds on any animal.

34:31.772 --> 34:34.775
This is new. I've never seen
anything like this before.

34:34.775 --> 34:37.650
What is it?

34:38.362 --> 34:41.697
I think... I think it's stopping.

34:45.534 --> 34:49.539
What was that?

34:49.539 --> 34:51.623
What was that?

35:01.676 --> 35:02.968
What the fuck?

35:14.147 --> 35:16.107
Er, it's OK.

35:24.241 --> 35:26.409
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Don't.

35:29.454 --> 35:31.581
- Oh, Jesus.
- Don't. Come on. Don't.

35:31.581 --> 35:34.917
I have to, OK? I have to. Just trust me.
Hey. Hey, man.

35:36.795 --> 35:40.840
Look, you can't help her, OK?
It's not her any more.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.219
Look, come on, man. Please.

35:46.263 --> 35:48.556
You should come with us, OK?
Come with us.

35:49.808 --> 35:54.688
You gotta come with me now, OK?
It's not her any more, alright?

35:54.688 --> 35:56.564
Go, baby. It's OK.

35:57.816 --> 36:00.694
- Seth, come on!
- It's not her. We're coming.

36:00.694 --> 36:03.821
It's not her, OK? It's OK. Go. Go.

36:09.703 --> 36:11.704
Help me get this open.

36:14.249 --> 36:15.876
OK. Alright.

36:15.876 --> 36:18.754
Shit! We need keys.

36:18.754 --> 36:22.298
Go. Go.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.601
Jesus.

36:42.736 --> 36:45.572
Where?

36:45.572 --> 36:47.073
Back door key.

36:50.786 --> 36:56.290
Door key. Where's that door key?
Door key. Door key.

37:04.591 --> 37:07.344
Back door key.

37:07.344 --> 37:09.929
Where's the fucking key,
the back door key?

37:12.307 --> 37:14.308
Shh. OK.

37:17.437 --> 37:20.065
- Gotta pop the hinges.
- What?

37:20.065 --> 37:22.817
- Screwdriver.
- What?

37:24.611 --> 37:26.821
Seth! Seth, get me a screwdriver.

37:27.906 --> 37:30.157
- Screwdriver?
- Give me a screwdriver!

37:30.992 --> 37:36.205
OK. Where would I be
if I were a screwdriver?

37:37.165 --> 37:38.958
Where...

37:45.924 --> 37:48.008
OK.

37:49.344 --> 37:52.805
The plan was to get her to Mexico,
get her clean.

37:57.185 --> 37:59.770
We both wanted a baby.

38:00.814 --> 38:03.442
We got a name in our minds.

38:03.442 --> 38:06.527
It was definitely gonna be a baby girl.

38:07.529 --> 38:09.572
We gotta get out of this gas station.

38:14.453 --> 38:17.038
- I can't get it.
- Let me get it.

38:21.001 --> 38:23.127
Hurry, baby. Hurry.

38:23.920 --> 38:27.340
Are you ready? On three.
One, two, three. Stand back.

38:27.340 --> 38:29.676
- OK. OK.
- Over there.

38:29.676 --> 38:31.761
OK.

38:32.763 --> 38:36.349
- OK.
- What?

38:36.349 --> 38:40.019
Wait, wait, wait.

38:49.237 --> 38:51.198
It's gone.

38:51.198 --> 38:54.116
It's on the roof.

38:56.495 --> 38:59.580
We gotta go. Go, go, go, go.

39:05.170 --> 39:06.796
Wait, wait, wait.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.965
It's stopped.

39:10.759 --> 39:13.011
Let's go.

39:13.011 --> 39:15.680
- No, no, no.
- Don't move! Stay there.

39:15.680 --> 39:16.847
OK.

39:18.558 --> 39:20.769
- Shit.
- Look, you gotta help us.

39:20.769 --> 39:23.814
- There's something out there.
- You're under arrest.

39:23.814 --> 39:26.358
Drop the gun.
Put your hands on your head.

39:26.358 --> 39:29.820
Look, you're not listening.
There's something out there!

39:29.820 --> 39:32.489
Got every state trooper
looking for you, Farell.

39:32.489 --> 39:35.701
None of them would mind
taking you out of here feet first.

39:35.701 --> 39:38.495
Ma'am, you really have to
get in your car, OK?

39:38.495 --> 39:40.122
- Go! Go, please!
- Right now.

39:40.122 --> 39:44.376
It's OK. I'm here now. You two are safe.
He's not gonna try anything
stupid.

39:44.376 --> 39:47.337
- It's not safe. Get in your car.
- I'll be alright.

39:47.337 --> 39:49.380
Get in your car!

39:49.965 --> 39:51.549
Jesus!

39:53.218 --> 39:55.721
- Jesus! What did you do?
- Just get in your car.

39:55.721 --> 40:01.101
Listen to me. You're gonna get
in your car right now and call this in.

40:01.101 --> 40:04.563
Wake the whole goddamn state
if you have to.

40:04.563 --> 40:08.358
Tell them you've got
a hostage situation on your hands.

40:08.358 --> 40:10.694
- I'm calling it in.
- Yeah.

40:10.694 --> 40:14.531
But I'm not going anywhere.
5-14, come in.

40:14.531 --> 40:17.701
- Please get in your car. Please!
- 5-14, come in.

40:17.701 --> 40:21.371
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
We're gonna get you out of there.

40:21.371 --> 40:23.748
5-14, come in.

40:28.045 --> 40:30.380
- Boyd!
- It's too late.

40:30.380 --> 40:33.632
Boyd! Are you there?

40:37.721 --> 40:40.848
Run! Run! Get out of there right now!

41:02.788 --> 41:04.038
Get away!

41:15.008 --> 41:19.637
It... It took half of her.

41:24.309 --> 41:27.854
It killed her. It killed her!

41:27.854 --> 41:30.148
- Seth!
- It's OK. It's OK.

41:30.148 --> 41:32.859
It killed her. It killed the other girl.

41:32.859 --> 41:35.278
It killed everything.

41:35.278 --> 41:38.740
And it's gonna get in here.
It's gonna kill us.

41:38.740 --> 41:41.450
- No, it's not.
- It's gonna kill us!

41:42.160 --> 41:44.245
It's gonna kill us.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.440
Her car's just right there.
We should make a run for it.

42:53.440 --> 42:57.486
Shit. That thing's way faster
than we are.

42:57.486 --> 42:59.321
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:59.321 --> 43:01.656
But we got a gun and we got a bat.

43:01.656 --> 43:04.950
A gun and a bat ain't gonna do shit.

43:05.744 --> 43:08.496
You got a firecracker
on your hands here.

43:09.748 --> 43:11.749
Lacey was like that.

43:13.377 --> 43:16.797
I'm nothing like your white-trash,
drugged-out girlfriend.

43:16.797 --> 43:20.133
- Firecracker.
- How is this helping exactly?

43:20.133 --> 43:23.762
- Easy, lady. Help can't even help us.
- We have to do something.

43:23.762 --> 43:27.474
OK. Let's, er... Let's just start
with what we know, OK?

43:27.474 --> 43:31.103
We don't know shit, Seth.
We know it attacks you and you die.

43:31.103 --> 43:35.440
No, we know that that thing infected his
girlfriend, so it's a parasite, right?

43:35.440 --> 43:38.944
It... It uses its host for mobility.
It consumes you.

43:38.944 --> 43:44.198
- It's... It's like a fungus or a mould.
- OK, so what are you saying?

43:47.703 --> 43:49.037
I don't know.

43:49.037 --> 43:52.164
So what you're saying is,
it attacks you and you die.

43:54.710 --> 43:59.672
She called it in, right?
So someone's gonna come.

44:01.174 --> 44:03.510
She called it in.

44:03.510 --> 44:07.097
- Nobody's coming.
- How do you know that?

44:07.097 --> 44:10.225
She said they were looking for you.
There's a manhunt on.

44:10.225 --> 44:13.854
Not here, there ain't.
Down south there will be.

44:13.854 --> 44:17.190
- They think I'm headed to Mexico.
- You are going to Mexico.

44:17.190 --> 44:18.900
Yeah.

44:18.900 --> 44:21.527
I'm going north. Platt first.

44:26.908 --> 44:28.993
Great.

44:29.911 --> 44:31.996
Wonderful.

44:42.674 --> 44:44.592
It's perfect.

44:45.343 --> 44:49.097
- Perfect.
- What? What's perfect?

44:49.097 --> 44:52.851
We're in state forest,
a national treasure, right?

44:52.851 --> 44:54.019
Yeah.

44:54.019 --> 44:57.230
There's ten feet
between the building and the trees.

44:57.230 --> 45:01.609
Oil runs down the steps,
across the dirt, into the trees.

45:03.487 --> 45:05.739
You wanna set the forest on fire?

45:05.739 --> 45:11.660
- Light it up and wait for the sirens.
- It won't work. Motor oil won't burn.

45:12.704 --> 45:16.208
But there is lighter fluid
by the barbecue supplies.

45:16.208 --> 45:18.627
- You...
- Firecracker.

45:18.627 --> 45:23.256
Wait. This is insane. You realise
the fire's gonna come right back at us?

45:23.256 --> 45:26.093
- It won't.
- What?

45:26.093 --> 45:28.052
Here.

45:28.970 --> 45:31.681
Give me one more. Thanks.

45:40.399 --> 45:45.320
Just wait. Just wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What if it's outside the door right now?

45:45.320 --> 45:48.699
Can we just stop
and think this through for a second?

45:48.699 --> 45:50.783
This'll work.

45:52.869 --> 45:55.997
Look, any way you slice it,
we're gonna be leaving a trail

45:55.997 --> 45:58.792
of flammable liquid
back into this building.

45:58.792 --> 46:02.254
This is a gas station. We're sitting on
a giant tank of gasoline.

46:02.254 --> 46:06.007
I know. But if we get fire trucks
out here, someone'll kill that thing.

46:06.007 --> 46:09.344
Being trapped in
a burning building, I don't like that.

46:09.344 --> 46:12.639
Your parasitic mould theory
isn't really working right now.

46:12.639 --> 46:16.142
So if you've got another idea,
go ahead.

46:20.313 --> 46:22.356
It's working!

46:36.955 --> 46:39.248
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

47:09.154 --> 47:14.076
All we have to do is grab it.
Take no more than three seconds.

47:14.076 --> 47:16.660
Yeah, three seconds is all it needs.

47:21.124 --> 47:22.708
OK.

47:27.881 --> 47:29.548
OK.

47:37.641 --> 47:39.058
What are you thinking?

47:47.442 --> 47:50.195
Here's what we're gonna do.
Tape these together,

47:50.195 --> 47:53.615
snake it outside, hook the receiver,
bring it up, make the call.

47:53.615 --> 47:57.368
No open doors,
no being outside, no fires, OK?

47:58.328 --> 47:59.995
OK.

48:08.088 --> 48:11.006
Right there. Hm-hm.

48:16.138 --> 48:17.430
OK.

48:54.509 --> 48:57.136
I don't think it's long enough.

49:15.322 --> 49:18.158
You OK?

49:18.158 --> 49:20.201
Yeah.

49:21.161 --> 49:23.871
I just cut myself.

49:54.611 --> 49:58.073
- Think he's got it.
- There you go.

49:58.073 --> 49:59.699
You got it.

50:08.041 --> 50:10.126
Fuck.

50:13.463 --> 50:15.548
Hm-hm.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.010
You got it right there.

50:19.010 --> 50:21.262
- OK, you got it.
- Grab it. Hold it.

50:24.474 --> 50:27.644
You got it. You got it.

50:27.644 --> 50:30.813
There you go, man.
Keep pulling. There you go.

50:34.401 --> 50:36.485
Pull it up slowly.

50:48.165 --> 50:50.249
There you go.

51:00.010 --> 51:02.636
There you go. Nice and easy.

51:09.770 --> 51:11.103
Come on.

51:17.778 --> 51:21.113
- There you go.
- You got it. Be careful.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.454
Holy fuck! Holy fuck.

51:27.454 --> 51:30.122
You got it. You got it. Hold onto it.

51:36.797 --> 51:39.840
You gotta hold on. Hold on.

51:56.108 --> 51:57.900
Polly!

51:58.402 --> 52:01.320
Polly! Stop! Polly!

52:02.030 --> 52:04.323
Let's go! Come on!

52:12.499 --> 52:15.793
It's breaking in.
It's breaking in. It's breaking in.

52:31.393 --> 52:32.935
It's gone.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.654
It took her legs.

52:47.117 --> 52:49.952
- Jesus Christ.
- Why would it do that?

52:53.832 --> 52:55.041
Where'd he go?

53:01.631 --> 53:06.302
- My God, do you think it got to him?
- I don't see how it would have.

53:07.512 --> 53:10.557
- Hey.
- Seth, I think he made a run for it.

53:10.557 --> 53:14.185
The front door's still locked.
Maybe he's in back.

53:23.904 --> 53:26.906
Seth. Seth.

53:27.866 --> 53:32.078
- He's not back there.
- What is it?

53:34.915 --> 53:36.999
Don't move.

53:38.126 --> 53:39.627
What is it doing?

53:41.046 --> 53:43.214
Run. Run!

53:44.257 --> 53:46.509
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

53:55.769 --> 53:57.353
Seth!

54:19.000 --> 54:22.212
Watch the splinters.
Don't let it stick you.

54:22.212 --> 54:25.257
- Go, Polly.
- Come on.

54:25.257 --> 54:27.591
Go! Go!

54:38.311 --> 54:40.062
Fuck off!

54:56.371 --> 54:58.664
Move away from the glass.

54:59.833 --> 55:01.667
It'll forget.

55:29.112 --> 55:33.200
- How did you know that?
- There's nothing smart about it.

55:33.200 --> 55:36.411
- I think he's right.
- Yeah, but it chased us in here.

55:36.411 --> 55:41.624
It tracks us somehow,
but it ain't thinking.

55:46.963 --> 55:50.425
I think it moves on instinct.
It's like at a cellular level,

55:50.425 --> 55:54.971
it's like a plant root
trying to find water.

55:54.971 --> 55:57.765
Yeah, but why can't it track us in here?

56:05.065 --> 56:06.315
I don't know.

56:14.616 --> 56:16.659
Oh, shit!

56:21.498 --> 56:23.041
- It's OK.
- Are you OK?

56:23.041 --> 56:27.002
- It's alright.
- What is it? Did it get you?

56:30.757 --> 56:33.467
Goddamn!

56:36.263 --> 56:39.348
Alright, don't let it touch you.

56:42.644 --> 56:45.022
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
- Don't touch it!

56:45.022 --> 56:47.357
- Here, let me just see.
- Don't touch it!

56:47.357 --> 56:50.067
- Get away from it!
- Listen...

56:54.072 --> 56:56.407
- You gotta...
- Stay away from it!

57:05.459 --> 57:07.251
Oh, God!

57:08.462 --> 57:09.587
Oh, my God!

57:11.089 --> 57:14.760
- Give me the knife.
- Fuck me.

57:14.760 --> 57:17.970
It's spreading.
I'm gonna have to cut it.

57:18.597 --> 57:20.599
Knife.

57:20.599 --> 57:23.809
- Get the knife, OK?
- OK.

57:24.728 --> 57:26.812
- Give me the knife!
- OK.

57:31.860 --> 57:34.904
- Oh, God.
- OK.

57:43.705 --> 57:46.083
- What do we do?
- We have to cut it.

57:46.083 --> 57:48.502
- What?
- Get something to hold his arm with.

57:48.502 --> 57:51.003
Grab that thing right there. Get it.

57:53.048 --> 57:56.218
Try to cover his arm.
Don't let any of those touch you, OK?

57:56.218 --> 57:59.595
OK. OK. OK.

58:03.183 --> 58:07.478
- I'm just gonna tie this off.
- Don't let it touch you.

58:08.271 --> 58:11.233
Hurry.

58:11.233 --> 58:13.401
- This is it?
- Yeah.

58:14.569 --> 58:17.071
- Hurry!
- OK.

58:21.118 --> 58:24.286
It's OK. It's OK.
We're cutting your arm off.

58:31.837 --> 58:34.130
- OK.
- Cut faster.

58:35.590 --> 58:37.675
- Fuck!
- Go!

58:40.637 --> 58:43.056
I can't get through the bone
with this knife.

58:43.056 --> 58:44.140
What?

58:45.892 --> 58:48.728
What are we gonna do?

58:49.938 --> 58:53.816
Seth? What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

58:56.820 --> 59:00.282
- Alright, on three. One.
- Do it.

59:00.282 --> 59:02.575
Two.

59:03.410 --> 59:05.119
Three.

59:22.763 --> 59:27.059
It started with that splinter
I got from the flat tyre.

59:27.059 --> 59:31.396
What we ran over was just the same
as that thing out there.

59:31.396 --> 59:33.481
That's all it took.

59:37.319 --> 59:40.989
Looks like I underestimated you.

59:40.989 --> 59:45.451
He can't change a tyre,
but fuck if he can't chop off an arm.

59:46.912 --> 59:48.079
Yeah, he's a keeper.

59:51.333 --> 59:54.168
This one, she locks me out
and leaves me for dead.

59:55.921 --> 01:00:00.759
Hell, I never dreamed this thing
would turn into a mÐ¹nage Ñˆ trois.

01:00:00.759 --> 01:00:03.886
I'd just as soon die with you two
as anybody else.

01:00:05.389 --> 01:00:07.516
I'll drink to that.

01:00:07.516 --> 01:00:10.185
I wish we'd have made it to Mexico, man.

01:00:10.185 --> 01:00:15.107
- I wish we'd never gone camping.
- Shut up. We're not dying in here.

01:00:15.107 --> 01:00:18.610
This is not over.
We just gotta get him to a hospital.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.030
- There's one in Platt, right?
- Don't know. Never been there.

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:25.700
That's just the place
Lacey was stashing my nest egg.

01:00:26.993 --> 01:00:28.661
You two never read about me?

01:00:29.454 --> 01:00:31.622
- You shot a cop?
- No.

01:00:32.499 --> 01:00:34.583
They shot me.

01:00:35.377 --> 01:00:38.546
I was stealing big rigs.

01:00:40.215 --> 01:00:46.763
Then this last time, I was working
on a five-day straight mid-high.

01:00:46.763 --> 01:00:51.392
I asked this guy to give up his keys.
He didn't and I shot him.

01:00:53.145 --> 01:00:57.983
Didn't kill him straight away,
just shattered his spine.

01:00:57.983 --> 01:01:02.320
He died about a year later, and by then,
him and his old lady had gone bankrupt

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.699
from all the medical bills
and I was sitting in the penitentiary.

01:01:10.203 --> 01:01:13.123
I know how it sounds.

01:01:13.123 --> 01:01:17.669
I just figured if I ever got out,
I'd do two things.

01:01:17.669 --> 01:01:21.214
I'd get my ass
across the border with Lacey

01:01:21.214 --> 01:01:24.342
and make sure his wife
was taken care of.

01:01:26.553 --> 01:01:29.472
You were gonna give your nest egg
to that trucker's wife?

01:01:33.852 --> 01:01:36.145
I know it sounds foolish, but...

01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:42.818
...I figured if I ever got
a second chance, she should too.

01:01:49.576 --> 01:01:53.287
Isn't he the strangest one-armed convict
you've ever met?

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:59.585
- Baby?
- Temperature.

01:02:03.715 --> 01:02:06.634
- I have to check something.
- What?

01:02:08.804 --> 01:02:10.513
We gotta chance it.

01:02:25.112 --> 01:02:27.196
Seth.

01:02:35.247 --> 01:02:37.957
- I don't see it.
- Stay ready.

01:02:39.918 --> 01:02:42.420
Maybe it rejoined the big one.

01:03:06.028 --> 01:03:07.486
Do you see it?

01:03:14.995 --> 01:03:16.662
Seth.

01:03:18.457 --> 01:03:20.332
Do you see it?

01:03:45.108 --> 01:03:49.279
Now, watch this.
Now, this has been stuck in my head.

01:03:49.279 --> 01:03:51.364
Watch out!

01:03:52.491 --> 01:03:56.827
Why does it give up on me
and go straight for the car?

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.794
- Watch out!
- See, it just hits the car.

01:04:03.794 --> 01:04:07.381
It doesn't turn after me.
I don't think it was ever going for me.

01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:11.967
It was going for the car cos the car
was hotter. I think it tracks with heat.

01:04:14.262 --> 01:04:17.265
It's a simple organism
and it's just looking for food.

01:04:17.265 --> 01:04:19.559
It goes for the warmest thing
and kills it.

01:04:19.559 --> 01:04:22.979
The engine was overheated, right?
So it was way hotter than me.

01:04:22.979 --> 01:04:25.357
It can't track us in the refrigerator.

01:04:25.357 --> 01:04:28.901
Exactly. It's too cold.
We're invisible to it.

01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:37.327
All I have to do is walk to the
sheriff's car and bring it to the door.

01:04:37.327 --> 01:04:42.165
No. That thing would be on you
in three seconds. You said so yourself.

01:04:42.165 --> 01:04:45.961
Yeah, but not if my temperature
was below the ambient temperature.

01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:48.505
The human body can drop
to 32 degrees Celsius

01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:53.593
before medical emergency occurs,
so that's 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:04:53.593 --> 01:04:55.721
Thank God for global warming in July.

01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:59.099
All we have to do is keep
my body temperature below 93 degrees.

01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:01.809
I'll be like a fucking ghost
to that thing.

01:05:06.857 --> 01:05:10.067
What about the medical emergency?

01:05:21.538 --> 01:05:23.456
95.

01:05:37.012 --> 01:05:39.389
Seth, you're gonna kill yourself.

01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:42.768
Not if you keep me above 89.6.

01:05:42.768 --> 01:05:45.394
Here, gotta get this hand cold.

01:05:53.612 --> 01:05:56.197
You don't have to prove anything to me.

01:05:57.741 --> 01:06:00.452
I know.

01:06:00.452 --> 01:06:04.331
But if we don't get out of here,
I'm never gonna...

01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:06.874
We'll never get to show that tent
who's boss.

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:17.635
Try it again.

01:06:25.352 --> 01:06:27.019
94.

01:06:41.785 --> 01:06:46.580
You don't wanna do too much of that.
You're gonna warm up my lips.

01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:50.543
Shut up.

01:06:54.006 --> 01:06:56.341
You're gonna be OK.

01:06:56.341 --> 01:06:59.051
Just a couple more degrees.

01:07:02.889 --> 01:07:05.057
Almost ready.

01:07:09.896 --> 01:07:13.775
We're gonna use these fireworks
to keep that thing off you, OK?

01:07:13.775 --> 01:07:16.277
- Got enough?
- Yeah.

01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:23.118
Hey, make sure she's ready
when I bring the car around, OK?

01:07:23.118 --> 01:07:25.579
She usually takes forever with that.

01:07:25.579 --> 01:07:28.914
No, no, no, don't touch me.
You're gonna warm me up.

01:07:32.335 --> 01:07:34.295
Come back.

01:07:35.005 --> 01:07:37.506
You know I will.

01:07:39.217 --> 01:07:41.261
I love you.

01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:43.346
I love you, too.

01:07:44.139 --> 01:07:46.807
Next year's gonna be better, I promise.

01:07:49.603 --> 01:07:51.687
Next year Hawaii.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.013
Alright, go! Go! Go!

01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:06.345
Damn it.

01:09:27.117 --> 01:09:31.078
Come on, buddy. You gotta go faster.

01:09:45.385 --> 01:09:47.761
He's gonna need more time.

01:09:55.937 --> 01:09:58.314
- He's almost there.
- There you go.

01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:05.196
Hey, fireworks.

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.588
I don't see it!

01:10:50.701 --> 01:10:51.951
Where'd it go?

01:10:56.665 --> 01:10:58.749
Hello.

01:11:00.377 --> 01:11:01.585
Hello.

01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:22.441
Polly! I don't see it.

01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:23.983
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:11:26.236 --> 01:11:28.404
- Seth!

01:11:31.742 --> 01:11:32.908
Seth!

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:25.795
Dennis!

01:12:30.175 --> 01:12:32.259
Come on! Get up! Get up!

01:12:54.032 --> 01:12:56.534
Polly? Come on.

01:13:16.388 --> 01:13:19.891
Where'd it go? Do you see it?

01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:21.142
No.

01:14:03.226 --> 01:14:05.061
Hold it.

01:14:16.073 --> 01:14:18.199
What? Hey!

01:14:27.209 --> 01:14:28.292
Hey!

01:14:36.843 --> 01:14:37.885
Shit!

01:14:43.767 --> 01:14:46.102
Seth! Seth!

01:14:51.983 --> 01:14:54.653
The fire.

01:14:54.653 --> 01:14:56.905
We gotta get it in the fire!

01:14:56.905 --> 01:14:58.906
Fuck. Polly!

01:15:02.077 --> 01:15:04.078
Polly!

01:15:11.795 --> 01:15:13.838
Here!

01:15:14.715 --> 01:15:17.174
- Are you sure?
- Here!

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.723
Go.

01:15:22.723 --> 01:15:24.807
Go!

01:15:33.483 --> 01:15:36.485
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Keep going.

01:15:42.659 --> 01:15:44.910
Keep running.

01:16:47.265 --> 01:16:48.641
Fuck it.

01:16:51.853 --> 01:16:54.231
Dennis.

01:16:54.231 --> 01:16:56.315
Go. Go.

01:17:02.072 --> 01:17:04.156
Let me see him.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:07.660
- Oh, no.
- What you gonna cut off now, Doc?

01:17:15.794 --> 01:17:18.964
Here. Take this.

01:17:18.964 --> 01:17:21.882
Take it to the bank in Platt.

01:17:24.428 --> 01:17:26.303
Give it all to her.

01:17:28.265 --> 01:17:34.353
- Now, you two, make it count.
- OK.

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:49.786
Now, get the fuck out of here.

01:17:49.786 --> 01:17:51.871
Come on.

01:17:53.248 --> 01:17:55.625
- Let's go.
- Go on.

01:17:55.625 --> 01:17:58.544
- Get out of here.
- Come on, Polly.

01:17:59.129 --> 01:18:01.422
Polly, come on.

01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:14.685
I love you.

01:18:15.854 --> 01:18:17.146
Fuck it.

01:18:24.071 --> 01:18:26.113
Fuck it.

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:34.538
Here I come, baby.

01:18:52.432 --> 01:18:55.769
Oh, baby.

01:18:55.769 --> 01:18:58.522
Now, we're gonna get you warmed up.

01:18:58.522 --> 01:19:01.733
Just tell me
if you see any fire trucks.

01:19:01.733 --> 01:19:06.446
Yeah, OK.
Well, I see a post oak.

01:19:06.446 --> 01:19:09.574
- It's gotta be 300 years old.
- It's not a post oak.

01:19:09.574 --> 01:19:12.202
- No?
- It's just a tree. Keep walking.

01:19:12.202 --> 01:19:14.078
OK.
