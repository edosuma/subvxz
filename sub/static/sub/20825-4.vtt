-Turnout's bad.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.372
Um, I just wanted to connect
before the rest of this day kicks in.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.706
I spoke to Marshall.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.791
No, I told him.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.542
Things are looking good.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.545
Very good.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.215
I really want to thank you for everything.
I mean, the ad and--

03:35.298 --> 03:36.842
I had nothing to do with that ad.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.635
No, of course, but...

03:38.719 --> 03:40.553
to thank you for your support.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.679

03:49.813 --> 03:50.814
You need to get ready.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.108
Today's gonna be a good day.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.777
You can sleep
when you get to the White House.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.112
-[all chuckle]
-Or maybe not.

affected the president's loss.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.602
There's a lot more election
to be had today.

06:34.686 --> 06:38.231
And we just want to apologize that,
because we have a little more work to do,

06:38.315 --> 06:39.732
we're not gonna be able to get over
to the ballroom

06:39.816 --> 06:42.194

But once we do get there,

06:42.277 --> 06:44.988

Oh, Mr. President... [sighs]

off guard over here.

I'm with the vice president,
the secretary of state Durant,

08:49.612 --> 08:53.075

is Counterterrorism Director Green.

<i>but we needed to act.</i>

Well, it took a while to get to me.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.333

<i>where we will coordinate.</i>

My family voted
at the Coliseum this morning.

09:50.173 --> 09:54.136
Mitch, listen to me.
Whatever you need, we will provide.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.056
[Doug] How are the Ohio numbers?

09:59.141 --> 10:01.309
[Tanya] <i>It's hard to gauge</i>

10:01.393 --> 10:02.602
That was kind of the point.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.646
For the other side, not Democrats.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.232
The governor's worried.
Do you have any numbers?

10:07.315 --> 10:09.192
No, just what we gave you.

10:09.276 --> 10:13.029
<i>I would think that the president might</i>
<i>have access to some numbers that we don't.</i>

10:13.113 --> 10:14.489
When I get them, you'll get them.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.949
-We're worried.
<i>-Hang in there.</i>

10:17.033 --> 10:19.452
I'll touch base with you
after the three o'clock wave.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.373
If you could all just give me
a moment, please. Thank you.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.585
You better head over to the ballroom.
One of us should make an appearance.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.462
Sir, the day has finally arrived.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.424
Yes, and let's see
just how long this day lasts.

10:36.636 --> 10:42.350
Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me
about Muhammed Kalabi just...

10:42.434 --> 10:44.101
moments before you did.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.147
Situation is still unfolding.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.731
On Election Day?

10:54.571 --> 10:55.780
Francis...

10:56.781 --> 10:58.866
it's been quite a journey
working with you.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.539
Kalabi slipped into the country,

11:04.622 --> 11:09.085
and he's planning a terrorist attack
against a voting center in Tennessee.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.047
And that is a terrifying proposition.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.427
Well, I may need you to stay around
the White House a bit longer, Cathy,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.429
until this situation is resolved.

11:20.847 --> 11:21.889
Of course.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.560
I was only saying...

11:27.019 --> 11:28.313
it's been a good run.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.164

11:47.249 --> 11:50.877

eager to pay me their last respects.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.421
When what they really want to do
to show their respect

11:53.505 --> 11:56.924
is to empty their bullets in my body,
just to make sure that I'm dead.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.054
Patti, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.724
Miss Harvey was just telling me that
there's been a change in the schedule.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.352
Yes, unfortunately,
we're in a bit of an emergency.

12:07.435 --> 12:10.272
Uh, but I hope it will be resolved soon.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.064
Tom, hello.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.528
-You know Mr. Yates, don't you?
-Yes, we met at the convention.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.237
So LeAnn will be at the hotel.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.908
She can reach me if you feel I need
to be there sooner rather than later.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.162
Uh, in case it's later...

12:26.245 --> 12:28.373
I want you to think
four years down the road.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.250
-I'm sorry?
-They trust you.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.963
Four years is no time.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.883
We have a car waiting.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.857
So we're shaking hands today?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.068
I think it's best we keep it like that.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.198
Well, shake it like you mean it.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.626
How's that?

13:21.008 --> 13:23.595
So you want me to just head
over to the ballroom?

13:26.305 --> 13:27.306
No.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.392
No.

across a large room.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.298
[reporter] <i>...it's a very chaotic scene</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

16:06.382 --> 16:07.383
What?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.301
[reporter]
<i>...there's a lot happening right now.</i>

16:09.385 --> 16:13.347
<i>Police are... are, of course, trying</i>
<i>to keep everyone calm and safe here.</i>

16:13.430 --> 16:14.641
<i>And we will bring you...</i>

16:16.726 --> 16:18.227
Where the hell were you?

16:18.310 --> 16:20.104
Tennessee.
What the hell's going on in Tennessee?

16:20.187 --> 16:23.107
Muhammed Kalabi, the ICO guy
from Syria who burned the effigy.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.233
What's the plan?

16:24.316 --> 16:28.029
<i>I stand before you this evening</i>
<i>as vice presidential candidate,</i>

16:28.112 --> 16:30.364
<i>as the First Lady of the United States,</i>

16:30.447 --> 16:34.410
<i>and most of all...</i>
<i>as a citizen of this great country.</i>

16:35.244 --> 16:39.541
Despite the violent incident
at the voting center in Knoxville,

16:39.624 --> 16:42.544
which the president
is attending to as we speak,

16:42.627 --> 16:46.506
we want to assure anyone
who's considering not voting

16:46.589 --> 16:50.635
that it is not only safe to vote,
it is your duty to do so.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.806
<i>It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat.</i>
<i>It doesn't matter if you're a Republican.</i>

16:54.889 --> 16:57.517
<i>Our nation needs you to vote today.</i>

16:57.600 --> 16:59.852
<i>Violence cannot beget apathy.</i>

16:59.936 --> 17:02.772
<i>We must make our voices heard.</i>

17:03.690 --> 17:05.733
[reporters clamoring] Seth!

17:05.817 --> 17:08.277
[Gina] Witnesses report
an FBI and Homeland presence

17:08.359 --> 17:10.070
at the Knoxville voting center.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.614
Do you believe this is ICO-related?

17:11.698 --> 17:12.699
[reporter] Seth, please! Come on.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.159
-[Gina] And the FBI isn't talking.
-Neither are you, Gina.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.118
This isn't a presser,
because I didn't schedule one.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.121
-We're just trying to find out--
-That's two, Gina.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.999
If you're looking for a strikeout,
I'm happy to oblige.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.960
No? Good.

17:24.042 --> 17:27.755
There's no questions at this time.
The First Lady's statement stands as is.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.382
I will have updates for you
on Tennessee as I get them.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.218
Is everyone clear?
Thank you.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.803
[reporters clamoring] Seth!

17:41.310 --> 17:42.895
I'm told everything just went wrong.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.731
-The FBI had the bomb guys there...
-[Shawna] But, Mitch...

17:44.814 --> 17:46.065
...for crying out loud!

17:46.148 --> 17:47.817
...injuries didn't go
beyond scrapes and bruises.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.486
Oh, I don't know about that, Shawna.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.572
Twelve people were taken to the hospital.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.406
[cell phone vibrating]

17:55.491 --> 17:57.702
[sighs] Look, is there any status
on Green's ETA?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.662
-Secretary Stewart and I...
-Yes. Just a moment, sir.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.164
-...cannot make a determination without--
-You need to take this.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.750
What? What?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.210
What the hell is this?

18:09.463 --> 18:10.464
[sighs] Hello.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.884
[Mark] <i>Governor. Mark Usher here.</i>

18:12.967 --> 18:14.886
<i>I think we met at the conference</i>
<i>in Sun Valley.</i>

18:14.969 --> 18:16.137
Yes, that's right.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.640
<i>Well, I wish I were calling</i>
<i>under better circumstances.</i>

18:18.723 --> 18:20.975
I wanted to know
what you're going to need.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.435
I can get some excellent people
down there fast in case you...

18:23.519 --> 18:25.980
you're feeling like you need
the extra security or...

18:26.063 --> 18:27.189
You there?

18:27.273 --> 18:28.691
<i>I'm right here, yeah.</i>

18:28.775 --> 18:30.234
I spoke to Shawna a few minutes ago,

18:30.317 --> 18:33.529
<i>and we agreed that we</i>
<i>absolutely cannot disrupt this election.</i>

18:33.613 --> 18:35.615
You called my secretary of state?

18:35.698 --> 18:37.241
Well, she called me.

18:37.324 --> 18:40.369
She is a leader of the party
in Tennessee. As are you.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.876
Do I need to remind you, sir,
that yours is a red state,

18:46.959 --> 18:48.628
and every Republican in it
is counting on you?

18:48.711 --> 18:51.172
-Thank you, Mr. Usher.
<i>-Now, hold on.</i>

18:51.255 --> 18:53.465
<i>Shawna just wanted to ask</i>
<i>what can be done and what can't be done.</i>

18:53.549 --> 18:56.343
She's like the rest of us,
trying to figure this thing out.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.596
[sighs]

18:59.681 --> 19:01.473
[man on TV]
<i>Because of the scale of a possible threat</i>

19:01.557 --> 19:03.434
<i>which we're still trying to determine,</i>

19:03.517 --> 19:07.021
<i>and because of the importance</i>
<i>of these, uh, voting centers,</i>

19:07.104 --> 19:08.815
<i>we're asking the governor to declare</i>

19:08.898 --> 19:11.025
<i>-a state of emergency...</i>
-Will, could you please sit?

19:11.943 --> 19:13.277
I don't like it.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.488
Three o'clock wave said Tennessee's
locked up, no matter what.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.616
Love, no one can see.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.329
What the hell?

19:23.412 --> 19:26.832
-[crowd screaming on TV]
-[reporter] <i>...be potentially disturbing.</i>

19:29.418 --> 19:32.504
[Green on speakerphone] <i>They don't bark</i>
<i>when there's a bomb.</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:34.131
What do you mean, "They don't bark"?

19:34.215 --> 19:37.844
[Green] <i>The canine units don't bark</i>
<i>when there's a bomb, Mr. President.</i>

19:37.927 --> 19:39.511
Yeah, but the whole building heard it.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.931
<i>They're trained to sit down</i>
<i>when they detect a bomb.</i>

19:42.014 --> 19:44.016
-So did they sit down?
<i>-No.</i>

19:44.100 --> 19:45.476
Then there was no bomb.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.394
We think the barking was provoked.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.188
<i>Provoked?</i>
<i>Director Green, that'll be enough.</i>

19:49.271 --> 19:51.816
These dogs are
our last line of defense, sir.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.360
I think ICO got in there today.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.070
And thank God they didn't get a bomb off,

19:56.153 --> 20:00.116
but whatever operative they got in there,
I think, was used to provoke the riot.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.283
<i>I said that is enough.</i>

20:01.367 --> 20:03.077
You think ICO
got all the way in that building

20:03.160 --> 20:05.872
and then just decided
not to set off a bomb?

20:05.955 --> 20:08.708
<i>-Well, there are--</i>
-We are not going to disrupt the voting.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.084
<i>Mitch, would you please</i>
<i>talk some sense into him?</i>

20:10.167 --> 20:11.627
-I--
-If we don't suspend,

20:11.711 --> 20:14.421
the Bureau cannot guarantee
the safety of these centers.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.799
<i>Unacceptable. Find Kalabi.</i>

20:16.883 --> 20:20.427
<i>The governor does not wanna have to</i>
<i>institute a curfew this late in the game.</i>

20:20.511 --> 20:23.097
-And, Mitch...
-[stammers] Uh, yes, sir.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.641
...you are not closing the polls.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.438
-[sighs]
-[phone beeps]

20:32.439 --> 20:33.775
[Green sighs]

20:37.945 --> 20:39.030
You think we should?

20:40.531 --> 20:42.199
I can't weigh in on this.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.956
[door opens and closes]

21:01.343 --> 21:02.344
[phone beeps]

21:02.428 --> 21:03.971
I need to talk to Shawna.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.101
-[sighs]
-[Tom] <i>How many scandals should the public</i>

21:09.185 --> 21:11.562
<i>be expected to endure</i>
<i>before they say, "Enough"?</i>

21:11.645 --> 21:13.856
Before they say, "I'm staying home"?

21:13.940 --> 21:17.151
Before they lose complete faith
in this democratic republic?

21:17.234 --> 21:21.989
<i>This is a trend that dates back</i>
<i>at least to when Nixon avoided jail time.</i>

21:22.073 --> 21:24.283
-[indistinct chatter]
-[man] Okay, we're out.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.367
[sighs]

21:27.870 --> 21:29.413
[exhales heavily]

21:31.415 --> 21:33.793
-You're good.
-I don't need fans, Sean.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.087
Just genuine appreciation.

21:36.170 --> 21:39.006
Would you like a drink?
One is brown and one is not.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.675
-[sighs] It's gonna be a long night.
-That's not what I hear.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.635
So, Tennessee...

21:43.719 --> 21:44.761
Is the question.

21:44.846 --> 21:45.930
And?

21:46.013 --> 21:47.431
My date knew nothing.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.891
Are you making the rounds?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.102
Crowd's a little older
than I'm used to, but...

21:51.185 --> 21:55.147
yes, they're a talkative bunch...
that don't say much.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.942
I'll take the brown one.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.696
That's Patricia Whittaker over there.
Chairperson of the DNC.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.531
She slapped me once in a bar in Omaha.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.200
For the life of me, I can't tell you why.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.082
There's something wrong with Tennessee.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.043
Your date is either lying or denying.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.258
[door opens and closes]

22:22.341 --> 22:24.260
[footsteps approaching]

22:38.190 --> 22:40.526
[Claire] What did you mean by this?

22:42.028 --> 22:43.404
On the back of the speech?

22:46.532 --> 22:48.325
[Yates] Nothing. Forget it.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.122
[Claire sighs] "There's still time"?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.792
There's still time for what?

23:00.504 --> 23:01.672
[Yates] What are you doing?

23:03.132 --> 23:04.300
You and your husband.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.261
[Claire] Getting ready to win an election.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.306
[Yates] I see the way you're acting.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.311
[Claire sighs]

23:22.109 --> 23:26.197
Do you realize we have
every intention of winning today?

23:27.781 --> 23:28.824
[Yates] Sure.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.994
But then what?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.837
[Yates grunts softly]

23:49.261 --> 23:52.431
I used to go to this cabin... up in Maine.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.019
The windows don't close properly.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.566
You can smell the ocean all summer long.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.128
I do think it's better
you go to the ballroom.

24:35.516 --> 24:40.021
If you have not voted, I assure you,
you will get the chance.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.648
But I cannot, in good conscience,

24:42.731 --> 24:46.943
allow balloting to continue
until I am satisfied that it is safe.

24:47.028 --> 24:49.988
<i>To that end, as nightfall approaches,</i>

24:50.072 --> 24:55.286
<i>I am announcing an enforced,</i>
<i>state-wide curfew, effective tonight.</i>

24:55.369 --> 24:59.123
<i>If you are not in your home</i>
<i>by 8:30 p.m. central time,</i>

24:59.206 --> 25:02.876
<i>or by 9:30 in the eastern parts</i>
<i>of this state,</i>

25:02.959 --> 25:06.880
<i>you will be subject to detention</i>
<i>and possible arrest.</i>

25:06.963 --> 25:08.674
What the hell's going on?

25:08.757 --> 25:11.843
What's going on is we're gonna win
Pennsylvania and Ohio.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.554
That puts you over 270.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.556
The polls are still open.
People are still voting.

25:15.639 --> 25:19.310
My gut says they're ours. [sighs]
That's 272 without Tennessee.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.228
[Conway] That asshole's
suspending the vote.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.980
That's up to his secretary of state,
and she's on our side.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.358
-She's gonna have a choice after this?
-Governor, listen to me.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.776
I mean, how long
do we let Francis Underwood

25:27.859 --> 25:29.820
get away with this kind of shit?
Huh? How long?

25:29.903 --> 25:31.322
He won't get away with it.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.531
-[sighs]
-He won't.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.241
[reporter] <i>That was Tennessee governor...</i>

25:34.325 --> 25:36.202
Trust me.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.537
[sighs] Bullshit.

25:40.289 --> 25:43.084
[reporter] <i>Voting centers</i>
<i>all across the state are being shut down,</i>

25:43.167 --> 25:44.501

<i>-by 8:30 central time, or 9:30...</i>
-[cell phone chimes]

25:47.671 --> 25:51.175
Five o'clock wave from Philly.
I think we're home.

<i>...detention and possible arrest.</i>
<i>This announcement...</i>

25:53.635 --> 25:55.387
[indistinct chatter]

26:00.476 --> 26:02.269
[Sean] That Tennessee shit is crazy.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.147
Crazy shit happens all the time.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.065
This convenient?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.737
Spare me the conspiracy talk.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.573
The government's not that powerful...
or competent.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.577
A man can ask.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.170
[Doug] We're looking at
255 Underwood, 245 Conway.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.463
Pennsylvania and Ohio?

26:29.546 --> 26:31.673
[LeAnn] Still too close,
but it's almost six o' clock.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.302
When we change Tennessee
from Conway to undecided--

26:35.386 --> 26:37.929
-That brings Conway down to--
-Two thirty-four. Still way too close.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.682
Yes, but we don't yet know
that he's locked in the western states.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.351
Those states have been locked up
for ten years.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.687
Red, red, red and they'll be red again
by the end of the night.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.731
It's gonna come down
to Pennsylvania and Ohio.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.526
Conway needs both.
You only need one.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.610
Matthews?

26:52.236 --> 26:54.946
He'll push back.
He might even go public.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.698
What about the other five states in play?

26:56.782 --> 26:57.949
[LeAnn] <i>The lawyers are waiting.</i>

26:58.033 --> 26:59.910
<i>We can generate lawsuits,</i>
<i>argue suppression, but...</i>

26:59.993 --> 27:01.162
Still not enough.

27:01.953 --> 27:02.996
[sighs]

27:03.079 --> 27:05.374
[Doug] Olmstead's losing in Ohio,
and he's not taking it well.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.501
I spoke with his chief of staff,
Tanya, this morning.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.628
[LeAnn] <i>He's getting clobbered</i>
<i>in the northern part of the state.</i>

27:09.711 --> 27:12.256
Low turnout in Cleveland's not helping.
But he could still pull it out.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.675
He's not going to win and he knows it.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.594
How much time do we have?

27:17.678 --> 27:20.972
[LeAnn] Ohio closes in two hours.
And most people voted this morning.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.350
Some of these states are baked in already.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.606
Claire and I need the room for a moment.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.525
[Doug] Yes, sir.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.985
-LeAnn, we'll call you back.
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

27:35.196 --> 27:36.363
[phone clicks]

27:45.331 --> 27:46.582
Why did you ask him to leave?

27:50.336 --> 27:54.840
Because I just wanted
to look in your eyes one more time

27:54.923 --> 27:56.800
before we do this.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.136
Francis...

28:00.721 --> 28:01.930
we're doing this.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.812
[Frank sighs]

28:10.356 --> 28:14.109
[Claire] He can't save us.
He invented term limits.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.696
Doug!

28:19.906 --> 28:22.826
-[phone beeps]
-Get me LeAnn Harvey back on the phone.

28:22.909 --> 28:23.952
Yes, sir.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.954
Do what you have to do with Ohio.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.706
-I'm on it.
-[phone rings]

28:28.707 --> 28:30.751
LeAnn, get the lawyers ready.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.339
-I can't do this.
-Yes, you can.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.592
-No, no, no, no, no!
-And it needs to be done quickly.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.469
It's too sloppy.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.304
Why are you here if LeAnn called me?

28:42.388 --> 28:45.432
Do I really have to explain to you
what will happen if you don't do this?

28:45.516 --> 28:47.768
I don't care if he loses.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.854
I'm not talking about the election.
I'm talking about you.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.982
What will happen to you?

28:56.318 --> 28:59.530
You have everything you need.
The Pastebin link was sent to you.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.073
[Aidan sighs]

29:03.617 --> 29:04.618
Where's LeAnn?

29:04.701 --> 29:06.495
She's not here,
and I'm short on time.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.456
[sighs]

29:14.753 --> 29:16.380
[Aidan sighs]

29:33.564 --> 29:36.567
Governor, I'm sorry,
but there's only one way to play this.

29:36.650 --> 29:39.653
<i>We need you to pull your poll workers and</i>
<i>your machines from those three counties.</i>

29:39.736 --> 29:41.822
The Republicans would crucify me.
They own that area.

29:41.905 --> 29:45.033
<i>But those are the precincts</i>
<i>that are most likely to be threatened.</i>

29:45.116 --> 29:47.243
"Likely to be"?
Hey, what are you...

29:47.328 --> 29:49.162
<i>What are we talking about here?</i>

29:49.245 --> 29:50.331
Terrorist chatter.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.915
Related to Tennessee?

29:51.998 --> 29:53.249
Yes, sir.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.751
<i>Well, I'm gonna need</i>
<i>more than your word on that.</i>

29:54.835 --> 29:57.421
Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence
is classified, Governor.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.047
Then read me in.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.550
'Cause I'm not doing this
without seeing tangible proof

30:01.633 --> 30:03.134
with my own eyes.
You can tell Francis.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.054
The other thing is,
with Ohio turnout so low,

30:06.137 --> 30:08.432
people could accuse you
of engaging in voter suppression.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.516
<i>What?</i>

30:09.600 --> 30:13.479
The voting centers and the troops
were the president's idea.

30:13.562 --> 30:16.440
<i>But you signed on to them,</i>
<i>and that's what matters.</i>

30:17.107 --> 30:19.985
You're losing your election, sir.
The signs are clear.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.364
<i>That'd be a real shame</i>
<i>for the Democrats to be down a governor.</i>

30:23.447 --> 30:26.325
<i>But here we have</i>
<i>this confluence of events.</i>

30:26.408 --> 30:30.412
<i>Your disappointing returns on one hand</i>
<i>and the chatter on the other.</i>

30:31.330 --> 30:33.999
I need proof.
Otherwise, people will think--

30:34.082 --> 30:36.835
That you shut down voting
in Republican precincts

30:36.918 --> 30:38.169
to guarantee your own win.

30:38.920 --> 30:43.216
Now I'd say it's a good thing that the NSA
just picked up on some credible chatter.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.010
This dangerous world left you no choice.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.220
[sighs]

30:47.303 --> 30:49.640
Oh... thank you.

30:50.766 --> 30:54.227
Governor, I was just handed
the classified intel.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.938
Are you on a secure server?

30:57.022 --> 30:59.024
-Yes, I am.
-Please hold.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.864
I'm sending the files over right now.

31:10.494 --> 31:11.745
[monitor chimes]

31:13.872 --> 31:15.206
[mimics explosion]

31:17.959 --> 31:19.169
[sighs]

31:21.296 --> 31:24.550
You're doing the right thing, sir.
We don't want blood on our hands.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.930
I don't care where they're taking
the voting machines.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.014
Just stay...

31:31.097 --> 31:33.892
You chain yourself to one of them
if you have to.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.852
Good.
I'm gonna find an Ohio judge.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.690
Voting centers in Ohio
have been closed for almost two hours.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.983
And Conway's got a judge.
He's petitioning to reopen.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.778
But even if they stay closed,
would Ohio get us there?

31:44.861 --> 31:46.447
[LeAnn] <i>Other states might be in play.</i>

31:46.530 --> 31:48.782
<i>Rumblings of suppression</i>
<i>are out there, although--</i>

31:48.865 --> 31:51.410
-Well, what else do we have?
<i>-Voter intimidation in Idaho.</i>

31:51.493 --> 31:53.454
What do you think? Should I call them back
and have them file?

31:54.204 --> 31:55.414
I like it.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.958
It has the most resonance
with what's happened in Tennessee.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.502
I also like an assemblyman
we have in Georgia.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.045
<i>There's a congressman in Maryland.</i>

32:02.128 --> 32:04.423
<i>That's one of the states</i>
<i>that didn't request the troops.</i>

32:04.506 --> 32:06.425
But wait. Don't we need something
coming from a voter?

32:06.508 --> 32:10.386
There's a voter in Mississippi.
Said she was too scared to vote.

32:10.471 --> 32:12.055
<i>That TV essentially told her not to go.</i>

32:12.138 --> 32:13.765
Well, that sounds like a bit of a stretch.

32:13.849 --> 32:17.811
That could be a plus for us, sir.
Really open things up.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.856
<i>If Ohio stays shut,</i>
<i>there could be a ripple effect.</i>

32:20.939 --> 32:23.024
This is all uncharted territory.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.276
All right, let's put a pin
in Georgia and Maryland,

32:25.360 --> 32:27.863
and let's keep
the Ohio voting centers shut down,

32:27.946 --> 32:29.405
and see where that gets us.

32:29.490 --> 32:32.117
[Tom] <i>Pennsylvania has gone to Conway.</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:34.911
<i>Even if Ohio is still too close to call</i>

32:34.995 --> 32:38.081
<i>and the president does well</i>
<i>in the Northwest,</i>

32:38.164 --> 32:40.834
<i>he can't counter</i>
<i>Conway's gains in the South,</i>

32:40.917 --> 32:43.211
<i>in what would typically be</i>
<i>Underwood territory.</i>

32:43.294 --> 32:44.921
<i>The people have spoken.</i>

32:45.005 --> 32:46.131
[indistinct chatter]

32:46.214 --> 32:47.799
[staffer] I can't believe this.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.552
The president apologizes
that he couldn't be here tonight,

32:50.636 --> 32:53.847
but he wanted me to let you know
that concession is inevitable.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.223
[staffers protesting indistinctly]

32:55.306 --> 32:56.933
All the states haven't been called yet.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.685
The president still has time if he needs--

32:58.769 --> 33:00.979
Guys, we fought a good fight.

33:01.062 --> 33:04.274
But, unfortunately,
this is the reality of the situation.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.860
-[Bob] Jesus.
-[indistinct chatter]

33:07.861 --> 33:09.154
Well, I guess that's that.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.326
-[cell phone vibrating]
-Yeah, this is Will.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.245
[Frank] <i>I wanted to be</i>
<i>the first to tell you</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:19.831
<i>congratulations, Mr. President-elect.</i>

33:21.291 --> 33:23.084
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.962
Oh, what? You think I learned
nothing from Al Gore?

33:27.964 --> 33:29.800
We kept them on the edge
of their seats, didn't we?

33:32.135 --> 33:34.262
I guess that means the system is working.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.014
I guess it does.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.224
<i>You're about as tough an opponent</i>
<i>as they come, Francis.</i>

33:38.308 --> 33:39.768
Well, I've had a lot of practice.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.188
<i>Now, you be sure to give my regards</i>
<i>to Hannah and the children.</i>

33:43.271 --> 33:44.981
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm...

33:45.899 --> 33:48.735
sure I'll be calling on you
for advice in the very near future.

33:48.819 --> 33:50.403
Well, I look forward to that.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.916
He conceded?

34:08.295 --> 34:10.172
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-[Hannah laughing]

34:13.009 --> 34:14.928
-[Marshall chuckles]
-We did it.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.514
We did it.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.560
[aide] Excuse me, sir.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.603
General Brockhart
is on his way over to the suite.

34:23.687 --> 34:24.688
Thank you.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.983
[laughing]

34:28.065 --> 34:30.318
[Hannah and Marshall laughing]

34:32.987 --> 34:35.114
<i>Sources are telling us</i>
<i>that Francis Underwood</i>

34:35.197 --> 34:36.574

-[disappointed murmuring]

<i>I suspect their numbers</i>

<i>which would put Ohio</i>
<i>in the Republican column.</i>

34:44.875 --> 34:49.462
<i>Enough to make William Conway</i>
<i>the next president of the United States.</i>

34:49.545 --> 34:52.132
-[music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

34:57.929 --> 34:59.848
<i>-Hello?</i>
-[Doug] Tanya, put him on the line.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.016
Hang on, let me see if I can get him.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.518
He's my secretary of state,
and he has the power to do it.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.186
Well, then you need
to tell him what to do.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.939
<i>He says he can reopen</i>
<i>and extend the voting day into tomorrow.</i>

35:08.023 --> 35:09.274
Tell him it's not safe.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.943
I've done that, Doug!
Obviously, he doesn't seem to care.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.737
Underwood conceded already.

35:13.820 --> 35:17.323
Do not trot out your secretary of state.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.574
Voting cannot resume.

35:18.659 --> 35:21.077
Now, if you have any doubt,
you swallow it right now.

35:21.161 --> 35:23.371
<i>I'm worried about the party.</i>
<i>What this could do to the party.</i>

35:23.454 --> 35:25.415
Roger, this is so much bigger
than the party.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.669
I feel like I'm risking
my entire career here.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.086
You are.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.632
And if you don't do what I'm telling you,
it's over for sure.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.471
What?

35:47.603 --> 35:51.191
How many hours is it gonna take him
to spit out the fucking words in public?

35:51.274 --> 35:53.484
Hey, screw this. Screw protocol.
I'm heading down there.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.361
-No, you're not.
-It's already tomorrow, Mark.

35:55.445 --> 35:56.487
I mean, this is insane.

35:56.571 --> 35:59.365
-I want to make my speech!
-Ohio is still in play.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.491
What?

36:02.202 --> 36:03.829
What are you talking about?

36:03.912 --> 36:05.956
<i>...fear from continued terrorist threats</i>

<i>and the disturbing news</i>

36:41.157 --> 36:44.911
New Jersey might not certify.
There's been a variety of irregularities.

36:44.995 --> 36:48.790
Same with Illinois.
Looks like Nevada's making noises, too.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.208

36:51.752 --> 36:54.545
I'm having déjà vu.
You ever get that?

Are you seriously asking me
about déjà vu?

36:59.009 --> 37:01.261
Never mind.
It's gone.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.681
You never get déjà vu?
Everybody does.

37:05.766 --> 37:06.767
I don't.

37:08.351 --> 37:11.730
Don't look so worried, Doug.
You just felt familiar for a second.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.274
It's over.

you're disappointed.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.431
Are you okay with the word disappointed?

37:49.475 --> 37:51.519
Shouldn't we acknowledge their outrage?

37:51.602 --> 37:53.188
[Mark] I'd say we should tread lightly.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.440
For now, we're just asking
for their patience.

Of course.

No, actually the pain

Could you just...
rub my eyes for me?

39:18.314 --> 39:20.191
But you hate that.

39:42.547 --> 39:43.882
[groaning]

39:49.554 --> 39:51.014
[Frank sighs]

39:54.225 --> 39:56.186
[Frank] There's no coming back from this.

39:57.938 --> 40:00.481
Oh, I know exactly what we're about to do.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.903
If we fail, it's on both of us.
I won't be able to protect you.

40:06.529 --> 40:09.074
[takes deep breath]
And what a relief that will be...

40:10.283 --> 40:11.492
for both of us.

40:15.621 --> 40:19.084
The American people
don't know what's best for them.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.168
I do.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.339
I know exactly what they need.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.426
They're like little children, Claire.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.179
Children we never had.

40:32.430 --> 40:37.143
We have to hold their sticky fingers
and wipe their filthy mouths.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.270
Teach them right from wrong.

40:39.354 --> 40:42.398
Tell them what to think
and how to feel and what to want.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.694
They even need help
writing their wildest dreams,

40:46.777 --> 40:49.030
crafting their worst fears.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.451
Lucky for them...

40:55.036 --> 40:56.329
they have me...

40:58.164 --> 40:59.624
they have you.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.669
Underwood.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.007
Underwood.

41:08.258 --> 41:09.675
2016.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.346
[takes deep breath]

41:13.429 --> 41:14.680
2020.

41:18.351 --> 41:19.685
2024.

41:22.938 --> 41:24.149
2028.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.568
2032.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.739
2036.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.828
One nation...

41:37.912 --> 41:39.539
Underwood.

41:55.596 --> 41:58.433
Doug, LeAnn...
do you have a moment?
