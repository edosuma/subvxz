00:32.340 --> 00:35.380
'Our future can never
be wholly known to us.

00:37.020 --> 00:41.340
'Our present, like an arrow,
can point the way ahead...

00:43.020 --> 00:45.570
'.. but we never know where it will land,

00:45.620 --> 00:49.740
'or what will be waiting
for us as we fall to Earth.'

01:01.100 --> 01:02.570
Nothing from Hong Kong?

01:02.620 --> 01:05.660
No... Not yet.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.250
I shall not partake of crumpets.

01:25.300 --> 01:29.170
They are too multicellular,
and too spongiform.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.850
And, in this case, they are too cold.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.170
They've only just been toasted.

01:34.220 --> 01:38.290
Grace was said betwixt their
toasting and their presentation.

01:38.340 --> 01:40.090
And it was a very long grace,

01:40.140 --> 01:44.220
comprised almost entirely
of unnecessary pauses.

01:46.540 --> 01:51.010
I was told today that the Family
Contraceptive Clinics were launching

01:51.060 --> 01:54.490
district clinics in an attempt
to cut down waiting lists.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.410
I hope there's going
to be one in our clinic.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.730
We're going to get one
in our Community Centre.

01:59.780 --> 02:03.130
On Tuesday afternoons, in
the small room at the back.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.650
It's been suggested that
patients use the side door.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.729
But the unmarried mothers
use the side door.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.889
Why can't everyone come in at the front?

02:10.940 --> 02:13.090
They're just women, not criminals.

02:13.140 --> 02:15.850
I don't think you need to use quite
such strong terms, Nurse Dyer.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.930
I'm sorry, Sister.

02:17.980 --> 02:20.650
Everyone coming to that clinic
is married, or about to be.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.050
Those are the rules.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.130
So why should they be made to
feel ashamed, or even embarrassed?

02:25.180 --> 02:27.890
Men have been buying contraception
from the barber's for years,

02:27.940 --> 02:29.290
apparently.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.770
A short back and sides and then,
"something for the weekend."

02:31.820 --> 02:34.090
Women should be able to
take care of their health

02:34.140 --> 02:35.850
in exactly the same way.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.400
"I'll have a perm and
the contraceptive pill."

02:39.980 --> 02:42.850
I shall be assisting the
doctor for the first few weeks,

02:42.900 --> 02:48.260
so I will have the chance to make
up my own opinion on such matters.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.410
You seem very engrossed in
your letter, Nurse Gilbert.

02:53.460 --> 02:56.250
My father has been given
a missionary posting.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.970
Ooh!

02:58.020 --> 03:00.930
He'll be passing through
London on his way to New Guinea.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.850
Your distress is not without foundation.

03:03.900 --> 03:08.290
There are tales of missionaries
served for luncheon in those climes,

03:08.340 --> 03:12.490
and evidence that suggests
that they are not apocryphal.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.210
That's not why I'm
upset, Sister Monica Joan.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.620
I'm upset because he's
going for three years.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.770
There's a lot to be done in New Guinea.

03:24.820 --> 03:30.170
And I don't want to stand
in the way of that, or him.

03:30.220 --> 03:34.010
That would be so wrong and so selfish.

03:34.060 --> 03:39.050
But ever since I was a child,
ever since I knew what love meant,

03:39.100 --> 03:42.450
I wanted him to be the one
who conducted my wedding.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.890
I knew it, too. From the moment I met him.

03:45.940 --> 03:49.220
Tom, we weren't even engaged then.

03:51.860 --> 03:57.250
Other girls always seemed to dream
about veils and white dresses.

03:57.300 --> 04:03.010
I just dreamed about him standing
there, waiting for me at the altar.

04:03.060 --> 04:07.660
Ready to hand me over to a
man whose face I couldn't see.

04:09.020 --> 04:10.690
And now...

04:10.740 --> 04:12.860
I know exactly who that man is.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.850
But my father isn't there

04:16.899 --> 04:21.290
because he's going to be 8,000
miles away for three years.

04:21.339 --> 04:24.090
I don't want to wait three years, Barbara.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.730
Nor do I.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.220
What are we going to do?

04:29.540 --> 04:32.290
I'm not at all content about there
being a separate entrance for

04:32.340 --> 04:34.330
the Family Contraceptive Clinic.

04:34.380 --> 04:37.810
I'm not terribly keen either, but
it's what the FCC have asked for.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.450
Confidentiality is paramount, apparently.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.650
Properly kept records are paramount!

04:42.700 --> 04:45.690
And we'll have women running in
round the side for contraception

04:45.740 --> 04:47.930
then strolling through the
middle corridor for their

04:47.980 --> 04:50.210
clinic appointments without
anyone booking them in.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.930
There's hardly going to be hordes
of patients going direct from

04:52.980 --> 04:55.010
Family Planning to Antenatal.

04:55.060 --> 04:58.170
I was talking about mothers
bringing babies to the clinic.

04:58.220 --> 05:02.060
And your role as Acting Sister
doesn't entitle you to be facetious.

05:04.100 --> 05:07.050
Please be advised that I'm not
taking this personally, Nurse Crane.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.490
Mrs Turner's clearly at
the mercy of her hormones.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.490
Could I prevail upon you
to join me in the kitchen?

05:13.540 --> 05:17.020
I'd like your opinion on a mother
who's not doing what she ought.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.570
Oh, hello, Wilma.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.170
What can I do for you today?

05:32.220 --> 05:33.850
I'd like a set of brass buttons,

05:33.900 --> 05:35.930
with an anchor detail,
if you got 'em, please.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.570
Planning on running away to sea?

05:37.620 --> 05:41.450
No, thanks! I once got sick
on a pedalo at Margate.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.010
But I am sprucing up my navy two-piece

05:44.060 --> 05:47.770
because, as of tomorrow,
I am back at work.

05:47.820 --> 05:51.170
Gail's nearly one now and my
sister Freda's going to have her.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.450
And Debbie and Denise are both at school.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.050
Well, fingers crossed that

05:55.100 --> 05:57.850
Mother Nature doesn't
give you another surprise.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.690
There'll be no surprises for
me, I've got everything in hand.

06:01.740 --> 06:04.730
Can I leave these
leaflets on your counter?

06:04.780 --> 06:07.690
I'm going to be a corsetiere at Constanza.

06:07.740 --> 06:11.740
Ooh! Constanza's a very superior brand!

06:13.660 --> 06:16.730
Are you all right, Mrs Buckle?

06:16.780 --> 06:21.130
I just got a bit hot and bothered
sorting out my mohair two ply.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.690
Is it the change of life?

06:23.740 --> 06:27.890
Constanza have a corset for that
-- page three of the leaflet.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.740
It's all referenced in delicate terms.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.490
As the nurse assures me
that your blood pressure

06:38.540 --> 06:41.050
and other checks are in
order, I'm pleased to say

06:41.100 --> 06:44.650
that you'll be leaving this
room with a packet of these.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.650
I can't wait to see the back
of my contraceptive douche.

06:47.700 --> 06:51.170
Filling the cylinder with soapy
water, then all that swilling.

06:51.220 --> 06:54.330
This system is altogether
simpler, Mrs Goddens.

06:54.380 --> 06:57.850
They don't look much different
to aspirin, do they?

06:57.900 --> 06:59.730
When you think what they can do.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.770
The most important thing to remember

07:01.820 --> 07:05.410
is that this drug is only
effective against pregnancy

07:05.460 --> 07:08.610
if taken every single day without fail,

07:08.660 --> 07:11.250
not just before or after
sexual intercourse.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.770
I know that.

07:12.820 --> 07:14.330
I looked it up in the library.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.850
In more than one book, too.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.330
I knew there was no chance
of my husband coming in --

07:18.380 --> 07:20.850
I don't think he's been in
the library in his life.

07:20.900 --> 07:24.610
Your husband isn't aware
you'll be using contraception?

07:24.660 --> 07:27.890
My Trevor's a man's man, Doctor.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.340
I think he's still hoping
I'll give him a son.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.170
Is it like opening a bank
account? Do I need his permission?

07:35.220 --> 07:38.010
You don't even need his
knowledge, Mrs Goddens.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.260
It's your body and they
will be your pills.

07:42.660 --> 07:46.580
I'll keep them in my handbag.
He'd never dare go in there.

07:49.380 --> 07:53.210
Tea and a Marie biscuit,
just like everyone else.

07:53.260 --> 07:57.330
Now, why haven't you been to any classes?

07:57.380 --> 07:59.170
Because I'm a midwife?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.810
According to your notes,

08:00.860 --> 08:03.770
you've still not decided whether
to give birth in hospital,

08:03.820 --> 08:06.290
the maternity home, or your own bed.

08:06.340 --> 08:08.130
I've been so busy.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.570
And when I looked into
the clinic records --

08:10.620 --> 08:14.290
the records, I might add, that
you're so particular about --

08:14.340 --> 08:18.050
you've missed three routine
check-ups in as many weeks.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.170
I'm expecting a baby, I'm not ill.

08:21.220 --> 08:23.810
I swear, I've never felt better.

08:23.860 --> 08:26.660
And I'll warrant you've
never felt more scared.

08:29.660 --> 08:31.380
Oh, lass.

08:32.580 --> 08:38.730
I've watched women becoming
mothers for nigh on 30 years,

08:38.780 --> 08:42.700
and midwife or not, you're
no different from the rest.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.050
It's time to give in,

08:46.100 --> 08:48.690
and to give up work.

08:48.740 --> 08:52.330
But once I stop, I won't
know where to start.

08:52.380 --> 08:56.290
Start by deciding where you're
going to have this baby.

08:56.340 --> 08:59.570
Then, unless you settle on the hospital,

08:59.620 --> 09:02.500
which one of us you
want to have deliver it.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.650
It's one of the very
few perks of our trade,

09:06.700 --> 09:10.060
and not one we all get
to take advantage of.

09:13.580 --> 09:16.370
I'm fetching my hat, my coat and my bag.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.450
I'm going home right now.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.810
- Will you tell Doctor Turner?
- Yes.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.260
And he'll be as pleased as I am.

09:24.340 --> 09:27.860
Thank you, Phyllis.
You've been a real friend.

10:03.580 --> 10:07.850
This really is the
loveliest, most exciting news.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.610
You've got your work cut out,

10:09.660 --> 10:12.050
getting a wedding together
in just three weeks.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.370
I promise you, it's all going to
be as simple as we can make it.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.090
But Barbara's father can
marry us before he sets sail,

10:18.140 --> 10:20.780
and that's the thing that matters most.

10:22.620 --> 10:25.490
I'm sure we could have asked
Fred to come and do this for us.

10:25.540 --> 10:29.610
No, no. It'll help me to get
match-fit before the baby comes.

10:29.660 --> 10:33.370
Besides, I like this new
fashion for doing-it-yourself.

10:33.420 --> 10:36.180
It feels as though we're
christening the house.

10:37.860 --> 10:39.770
I think the best way
of christening the house

10:39.820 --> 10:42.490
would be to have the baby here.

10:42.540 --> 10:46.570
Here? What if something goes wrong?

10:46.620 --> 10:49.690
No, I'd be a lot happier if
you went to the maternity home

10:49.740 --> 10:51.410
as soon as you go into labour.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.970
And I'd be much happier here,

10:54.020 --> 10:57.490
in my own home, in my own bed,

10:57.540 --> 11:00.930
with one beautiful wall of
patterned paper behind it.

11:00.980 --> 11:03.540
Patrick, I've made up my mind.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.650
I'm out of bread for
sandwiches tomorrow, Trevor,

11:13.700 --> 11:16.930
and I've got a corsetry customer
first thing in the morning.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.650
Will you take some of that
leftover corned beef hash?

11:19.700 --> 11:22.970
Not cold. I don't get
hungry till half past 12.

11:23.020 --> 11:25.420
You could bring me some sandwiches then.

11:26.740 --> 11:29.690
You don't half look beautiful, Wilma.

11:29.740 --> 11:32.050
I'm doing something I enjoy.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.450
And I've started wearing make-up again.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.210
We had to have a grooming
class before they gave us

11:37.260 --> 11:38.700
our Constanza badges.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.530
You look beautiful.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.690
Like you did when we were young,

11:45.740 --> 11:48.490
when we used to get up
to no good on this settee,

11:48.540 --> 11:51.130
when it was still in your grandma's house.

11:51.180 --> 11:54.930
First payday I get, I'm going
to replace this monstrosity.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.730
My grandad died on it,

11:56.780 --> 11:59.820
and every time the wind blows
the wrong way, I'm reminded.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.650
I reckon this one, Babs.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.130
You don't get many opportunities
in life to wear a train.

12:11.180 --> 12:14.530
Oh, Delia! I'd look like
a bride in a pantomime!

12:14.580 --> 12:16.930
I just want something
plain, simple and straight.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.970
Oh, there's absolutely no chance of that

12:19.020 --> 12:21.530
if you insist on using
a commercial pattern.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.690
Ever since the Duchess
of Kent got married,

12:23.740 --> 12:26.170
every girl that gets spliced
has been dragging around

12:26.220 --> 12:28.650
six feet of lace with a
tulle overlay behind them.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.970
I've no choice but to use a
commercial pattern, Trixie.

12:31.020 --> 12:34.090
All the other dressmakers are busy,
so I'm having to make my own outfit.

12:34.140 --> 12:38.130
Oh, my Auntie Jean's a seamstress
at De Laine Home Furnishings.

12:38.180 --> 12:41.410
But if we let her loose, Barbara
will be coming down the aisle

12:41.460 --> 12:43.370
in a pair of curtains and a pelmet.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.460
- What about...?
- Oh, that is nice.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.130
I ain't saying it's turned
nippy all of a sudden,

12:55.180 --> 12:57.530
but I ain't half glad
I'm not a brass monkey.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.530
Feel them! Bloomin' freezing!

12:59.580 --> 13:01.570
Oh, leave them there.

13:01.620 --> 13:04.890
You ain't half warm, Vi, ain't
a touch of the flu, is it?

13:04.940 --> 13:06.860
No, Fred. It isn't!

13:11.980 --> 13:13.970
In case anyone is unaware,

13:14.020 --> 13:17.450
Nurse Franklin has been summoned
to her secondment at St Cuthbert's

13:17.500 --> 13:19.170
three days early.

13:19.220 --> 13:22.170
Lovely for Female Medical,
not so good for us.

13:22.220 --> 13:25.730
I'm afraid there's been an outbreak
of impetigo in Lisbon Buildings.

13:25.780 --> 13:29.210
It's one glad tidings after
another, this morning.

13:29.260 --> 13:31.930
So, Sister Winifred, the booking-in list,

13:31.980 --> 13:34.490
Nurse Dyer, the postnatal round,

13:34.540 --> 13:37.450
Nurse Gilbert, district
nursing for you this week.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.490
We've bedsores, diabetes and haemorrhoids

13:40.540 --> 13:43.250
the length of the commercial road.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.330
I thought sending you down that way

13:45.380 --> 13:47.890
- would help you fit in
your bridal errands. - Oh!

13:47.940 --> 13:51.570
Good morning! I've
brought today's insulin.

13:51.620 --> 13:54.090
And as soon as I've handed it over...

13:54.140 --> 13:58.290
I'm officially off work
until further notice.

13:58.340 --> 14:01.930
Meanwhile, Nurse Crane
reminded me that, as a midwife,

14:01.980 --> 14:05.690
I can choose which colleague
I'd like to deliver my baby.

14:05.740 --> 14:10.370
And after a great deal
of thought, I've chosen...

14:10.420 --> 14:12.420
Sister Julienne.

14:14.940 --> 14:16.810
Oh, my dear!

14:16.860 --> 14:18.450
Is that all right?

14:18.500 --> 14:19.930
Oh, yes.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.330
Oh, thank you.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.290
♪ Why haven't I told you?

14:37.340 --> 14:42.530
♪ Oh, baby, I've told every little star

14:42.580 --> 14:46.770
♪ Just how sweet I think you are

14:46.820 --> 14:51.820
♪ Why haven't you told me? ♪

15:02.580 --> 15:06.490
We'll have 30 people
at the reception, or 29,

15:06.540 --> 15:09.250
if my sister goes into
labour and can't come.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.490
When I spoke to your father he
thanked me for doing it quickly

15:12.540 --> 15:14.850
and quietly because of
the money he'll save.

15:14.900 --> 15:18.220
In fact, he said we were
perfectly welcome to elope.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.530
He's never been well-off,

15:21.580 --> 15:25.090
but I suppose that's part
of having a vocation.

15:25.140 --> 15:27.690
I remember once, when I was little,

15:27.740 --> 15:31.010
the fair came to the
bombsite opposite the church.

15:31.060 --> 15:36.410
I begged him to take me, and in the
end he said I could have one ride.

15:36.460 --> 15:40.100
I can still see him reaching into
his pocket for that sixpence.

15:41.300 --> 15:45.410
It was the first time I noticed
that his trousers were shabby.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.170
And then he lifted me up onto

15:47.220 --> 15:50.090
the most beautiful horse on the carousel,

15:50.140 --> 15:53.860
and he stood and he waved
and watched as I went round.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.650
You've never told me that.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.100
No.

16:00.380 --> 16:04.650
I suppose the day will come when
we've told one another everything

16:04.700 --> 16:06.770
and we won't have anything new to say

16:06.820 --> 16:12.410
because one way or another we've
shared everything that matters.

16:12.460 --> 16:15.420
- I hope so.
- So do I.

16:18.220 --> 16:22.370
And in the spirit of full
and frank disclosure,

16:22.420 --> 16:24.930
please be aware that I am now booked into

16:24.980 --> 16:27.170
the Family Contraceptive Clinic,

16:27.220 --> 16:30.300
and all measures will be in
place by our wedding night.

16:33.380 --> 16:36.930
Excess perspiration is often a problem
for ladies undergoing the change of life.

16:36.980 --> 16:41.530
Constanza have a wonderful
range of perforated corsets

16:41.580 --> 16:46.050
which allow moisture to escape
and evaporate naturally.

16:46.100 --> 16:51.460
This reduces body temperature and
preserves intimate freshness.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.330
Well, you're a convincing
saleswoman, Wilma,

16:55.380 --> 16:56.730
I'll give you that.

16:56.780 --> 16:59.730
I've achieved the highest
sales in the East London area

16:59.780 --> 17:01.650
in the past fortnight.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.210
My commission payment's
already on its way.

17:04.260 --> 17:06.290
Oh!

17:06.339 --> 17:08.050
You all right, Wilma?

17:08.099 --> 17:10.290
I must've pulled a muscle in my leg.

17:10.339 --> 17:13.900
I walk miles every day, I'm that busy.

17:18.940 --> 17:21.260
Oh, Nurse Crane?

17:22.859 --> 17:24.690
This had better be more important than

17:24.740 --> 17:27.530
the protein I've just found
in Mrs Kyriakou's urine.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.330
Oh, I'm not sure it is.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.690
But I have an appointment in
a minute in the back room.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.330
May I be excused?

17:34.380 --> 17:37.970
You may be excused when
you've put your patients first

17:38.020 --> 17:40.820
and worked your way through
that weighing queue!

17:58.180 --> 18:00.770
I have an appointment, Sister Julienne,

18:00.820 --> 18:03.370
with the Family Planning doctor.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.810
I would've been here ten minutes ago,

18:05.860 --> 18:07.810
but Nurse Crane was cracking the whip.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.490
I'm not sure what's wrong with her today.

18:10.540 --> 18:13.170
At times of great
happiness, Nurse Gilbert,

18:13.220 --> 18:15.050
it is sometimes as well to remember

18:15.100 --> 18:19.690
that others may be ploughing
a less congenial path.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.460
Do sit down.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.330
Being a nurse,

18:24.380 --> 18:27.570
- you'll be familiar with anatomical
terms for the body. - Yes.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.410
In which case, all I need to tell you

18:30.460 --> 18:34.850
is that I'm folding the
diaphragm in half, like so...

18:34.900 --> 18:39.330
and gently inserting it into
the vagina before releasing it

18:39.380 --> 18:41.970
so that it opens out into a full cup shape

18:42.020 --> 18:44.210
and neatly covers the cervix,

18:44.260 --> 18:47.330
preventing sperm from entering the uterus.

18:47.380 --> 18:50.290
Now, try not to tense your muscles.

18:50.340 --> 18:53.250
The vagina is a
surprisingly elastic organ,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.570
as midwifery will have shown you.

18:55.620 --> 18:56.860
Yes.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.450
You can pop your briefs back on, sit up.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.530
Are you leaving it in?

19:04.580 --> 19:06.970
You need to wear it for
a few hours each day,

19:07.020 --> 19:09.530
then report back to me
with regard to comfort

19:09.580 --> 19:11.610
and the snugness of the fit.

19:11.660 --> 19:14.490
We can go up or down a size if need be.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.250
Don't rely on it for protection though.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.930
Oh, we aren't getting married for a week.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.850
How does that feel?

19:21.900 --> 19:23.580
Marvellous.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.580
Ooh!

19:51.180 --> 19:53.220
Ooh!

19:58.580 --> 20:01.220
I do feel so much calmer
since I gave up work.

20:02.780 --> 20:05.770
I think you might feel the same
if you could just be my husband

20:05.820 --> 20:07.770
and not my doctor, too.

20:07.820 --> 20:11.820
And I think it, it might be best
if you don't attend the birth.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.250
But it never occurred to me
that you wouldn't want me there.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.690
I want you there as
soon as the baby's born.

20:19.740 --> 20:24.050
But we've been in too many delivery
rooms together before today.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.610
Solving problems, preventing disasters.

20:27.660 --> 20:32.060
And we do prevent disasters. We're a team.

20:34.420 --> 20:37.770
Patrick... I know that
you're looking at my ankles

20:37.820 --> 20:39.810
and thinking that they're swollen.

20:39.860 --> 20:44.290
If you're not experiencing headaches
and there's no sign of proteinuria,

20:44.340 --> 20:47.690
then it could just be the
normal odoema of late pregnancy.

20:47.740 --> 20:51.530
See? The minute you look
at me, you go to work.

20:51.580 --> 20:53.250
No.

20:53.300 --> 20:56.500
The minute I look at you, I'll
give you everything you ask for.

21:04.820 --> 21:07.140
Phyllis, I need to talk to you.

21:08.340 --> 21:12.250
I'm sorry, Barbara, but I've a long
list of things to do this evening

21:12.300 --> 21:15.100
and these exercises loom large on it.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.490
You do a lot of favours
for people, Phyllis,

21:18.540 --> 21:21.610
and I'm afraid I'm about
to ask you for another one.

21:21.660 --> 21:23.290
Is it about the wedding?

21:23.340 --> 21:24.970
Yes, it is.

21:25.020 --> 21:27.610
And what I want to ask
you is this, Phyllis --

21:27.660 --> 21:29.660
will you be my bridesmaid?

21:33.500 --> 21:35.340
Your-your bridesmaid?

21:36.820 --> 21:38.210
Oh...

21:38.260 --> 21:42.290
No. Barbara, no.

21:42.340 --> 21:45.370
You ought to choose one of your friends.

21:45.420 --> 21:47.690
I have chosen one of my friends.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.050
I've chosen you.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.450
We've been sharing a bedroom
for two years, Phyllis.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.250
Going halves on the mantelpiece
and the bedside table

21:56.300 --> 21:59.290
and taking it in turns to open the
curtains and turn the light off.

21:59.340 --> 22:03.690
And if I snore, you've never once
complained, or even mentioned it.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.940
You hardly do it on purpose.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.690
You've taught me as much about
living alongside another person

22:10.740 --> 22:12.890
as anyone else in my life, Phyllis.

22:12.940 --> 22:16.130
And I'm ready to move on and share
everything I have with someone

22:16.180 --> 22:18.850
who is unbelievably dear to me

22:18.900 --> 22:22.460
and that's because you've been the
very best friend I could've had.

22:24.660 --> 22:28.610
Who's going to help me
with my Spanish vocab now?

22:28.660 --> 22:32.580
No lo se. Pero ella es muy afortunada.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.780
I don't know, but she is
going to be very lucky.

22:42.980 --> 22:46.770
This shape settee's all
the rage in Scandinavia.

22:46.820 --> 22:50.450
I've seen Diana Dors
sitting on one in Photoplay.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.170
Diana Dors isn't Scandinavian.
She's from Swindon.

22:54.220 --> 22:57.130
For pity's sake, Trevor!

22:57.180 --> 23:01.170
You're perched over there like
Humpty Dumpty with flaming piles.

23:01.220 --> 23:04.210
Will you get over here and
sit on this new settee?

23:04.260 --> 23:06.250
I liked the old settee.

23:06.300 --> 23:09.810
Anyway, if you'd waited, I would've
bought a new settee for you.

23:09.860 --> 23:12.170
Why should you have to
work for everything?

23:12.220 --> 23:15.130
Cos I'm the man of the house.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.770
I do love you, Trevor.

23:17.820 --> 23:20.220
You aren't half old-fashioned.

23:33.700 --> 23:36.930
There's a Babycham on the
draining board, if you want it?

23:36.980 --> 23:38.890
I don't want Babycham.

23:38.940 --> 23:40.690
I just want you.

23:46.140 --> 23:47.610
When I heard you lived in a convent,

23:47.660 --> 23:50.940
- I had no idea your life would
be quite so... - Entertaining?

23:54.260 --> 23:58.530
I've been wanting to ask
you something, Trixie.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.460
And that is...

24:02.860 --> 24:05.020
.. would you agree to meet Alexandra?

24:06.620 --> 24:08.690
Your daughter?

24:08.740 --> 24:11.370
She's so little, Christopher.

24:11.420 --> 24:14.530
And girls of that age are
complicated creatures.

24:14.580 --> 24:19.530
And if they're from an unhappy home,
they're terribly easy to hurt.

24:19.580 --> 24:21.780
Will you at least consider it?

24:23.620 --> 24:27.450
Yes, I will consider it,

24:27.500 --> 24:30.900
but I won't if I don't think I'm
going to be very good for her.

24:34.180 --> 24:36.290
Trevor! It's the epilogue!

24:36.340 --> 24:38.820
We've both got work in the morning!

24:43.660 --> 24:46.100
It's not such a terrible settee, really.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.740
Barbara?

25:23.940 --> 25:25.610
Oh, no!

25:25.660 --> 25:28.260
Did it not go as planned?

25:30.340 --> 25:31.810
No.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.620
And what's worse is I
dreamed I'd finished it.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.660
It's such a mess, Valerie.

25:40.860 --> 25:43.970
This nylon lace has a mind of its own.

25:44.020 --> 25:47.010
I've never seen the point of slaving
away making your own clothes,

25:47.060 --> 25:49.130
there's plenty of stuff
you can buy in the shops.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.810
The point is that it saves money.

25:50.860 --> 25:53.620
Yeah, fair enough.

25:55.340 --> 25:58.090
Right, miss. Bed. Now.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.370
Before Nurse Crane wakes up

25:59.420 --> 26:01.970
and puts in her order for
her bridesmaid's dress.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.820
We'll sort something out.

26:05.100 --> 26:07.370
Just don't try sewing anything.

26:07.420 --> 26:10.980
Machining that lace is
like dicing with insanity.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.660
Argh!

26:27.620 --> 26:28.940
Thanks.

26:51.900 --> 26:53.450
Good morning, Nurse Gilbert!

26:53.500 --> 26:56.290
Good morning, Sister Julienne.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.810
Nurse Dyer explained that
your dress-making efforts

26:58.860 --> 27:01.250
rather overwhelmed you.

27:01.300 --> 27:04.570
Oh, I've decided to write to my sister

27:04.620 --> 27:07.530
and borrow her cream two-piece
that she wears for parish high days

27:07.580 --> 27:11.820
and holidays. And a new hair
band will hardly break the bank.

27:13.620 --> 27:17.450
Banks are there to be broken
on occasions such as this, lass.

27:17.500 --> 27:21.410
And we would so very much like you
to have the celebration you deserve,

27:21.460 --> 27:25.290
that we've joined forces to
provide you with the wherewithal.

27:25.340 --> 27:28.530
In other words, we had a whip-round.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.210
But...

27:30.260 --> 27:32.490
We absolutely insist.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.690
And there will be no argument.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.260
Oh, thank you.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.700
Oh, gosh.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.810
Are you sure you don't want to
try on a bridesmaid's dress?

27:49.860 --> 27:53.530
I'm quite sure nobody wants to see
me in ballerina-length shantung.

27:53.580 --> 27:58.890
I shall be quite content with that
boucle coat and skirt I've borrowed.

27:58.940 --> 28:03.090
Just promise me you won't let
that shop assistant in here.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.050
If she pushes any harder for
an off-the-shoulder neckline,

28:06.100 --> 28:07.800
she'll have me to reckon with.

28:12.740 --> 28:15.610
I've come out wearing a bra
that's mended with a safety pin!

28:15.660 --> 28:18.180
And no girdle on, either. Oh, Barbara!

28:25.260 --> 28:27.180
I do have a favourite.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.620
But I'm not saying which it is.

28:33.020 --> 28:35.420
You'll need a corset under it.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.850
I'm not buying anything that
can't be worn over tights

28:39.900 --> 28:41.820
and an elastic roll-on.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.410
Patients and mothers at the clinic

28:50.460 --> 28:53.490
keep giving me bootees
and matinee jackets.

28:53.540 --> 28:56.980
Oh, I could kit out an orphanage
in white and lemon three ply.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.930
Once we've seen to your checks,

29:00.980 --> 29:03.690
I'd like to try working on
some relaxation exercises.

29:03.740 --> 29:07.090
I thought you might enjoy
singing, to help you during labour.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.050
- Singing?
- Nurse Gilbert said she'd given you

29:10.100 --> 29:12.730
the Breathe Your Way To Serenity leaflet.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.980
I made a list of things to do on it.

29:19.980 --> 29:21.740
You never could sit still.

29:23.140 --> 29:26.930
Even when you first came
to us, as a postulant.

29:26.980 --> 29:30.810
God seemed to be asking
so many things of me.

29:30.860 --> 29:35.420
I tried to do them all, even when
I wasn't sure I was succeeding.

29:39.260 --> 29:41.330
I say to myself sometimes,

29:41.380 --> 29:45.930
"Deels, you know who you
are, nobody else does.

29:45.980 --> 29:48.740
"That doesn't matter, it's
probably just as well."

29:51.140 --> 29:53.180
But someone knew who I was once.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.500
But it's as if she's vanished.

29:59.740 --> 30:02.260
And because I can't reach her...

30:05.020 --> 30:06.540
.. I've just disappeared.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.340
I'm going to get you a taxi.

30:22.980 --> 30:27.340
I was just going to tiptoe
away if you were still asleep.

30:29.340 --> 30:32.890
Angela put a biscuit in
the saucer. Pink wafer.

30:32.940 --> 30:35.010
I could eat a pink wafer.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.580
Oh!

30:37.860 --> 30:39.930
Mmm.

30:39.980 --> 30:44.050
- Am I all right to go to work today?
- Absolutely.

30:44.100 --> 30:47.450
If there's any change in my
condition, you will be informed.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.940
- Just...
- Like any other father.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.580
[That's my shoe! Give it back!]

31:12.620 --> 31:14.130
Fetch your dad!

31:14.180 --> 31:16.010
I'm sending an ambulance, Mr Goddens.

31:16.060 --> 31:19.810
Go straight back to your flat and
stay with your wife till it arrives.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.450
No. Just go back home.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.370
Doctor will be with you
within five minutes.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.890
Has she said anything
about any pain in her arm?

31:33.940 --> 31:35.570
Particularly her left arm?

31:35.620 --> 31:37.250
Or her jaw?

31:37.300 --> 31:40.010
No. She said her leg hurt!

31:40.060 --> 31:42.380
But that was the other day, it wore off.

31:44.420 --> 31:46.690
Argh!

31:46.740 --> 31:49.580
We need to have her
transferred to hospital.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.740
What is it?

31:54.460 --> 31:57.650
- What is it, love?
- Handbag.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.500
She wants her handbag.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.220
Wa-hey!

32:11.540 --> 32:15.050
The menopause. Have you heard of it?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.530
No.

32:16.580 --> 32:19.370
- The change of life?
- Oh, yeah.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.570
Well, it's driving me mad.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.850
I've got headaches, I can't concentrate,

32:23.900 --> 32:25.730
can't stop perspiring,

32:25.780 --> 32:28.690
and I can't stop thinking
about how things were before.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.450
How do you mean, before?

32:30.500 --> 32:33.330
Before this. Before now.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.850
When I was young, and a mum,

32:35.900 --> 32:39.370
even when we had Reggie
and I became a mum to him.

32:39.420 --> 32:42.570
And now I just don't feel
like I'm anything any more.

32:42.620 --> 32:45.900
Oh, Vi. Come here.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.380
Side room number three, please.

33:19.860 --> 33:22.090
I've eaten a whole packet of pink wafers

33:22.140 --> 33:24.420
and all the pains are coming in my back.

33:27.140 --> 33:29.730
A light snack in the
first stages of labour

33:29.780 --> 33:32.530
can actually help build up some energy.

33:32.580 --> 33:35.210
I've said that to so many people.

33:35.260 --> 33:37.650
I also tell them to have
something nice and plain,

33:37.700 --> 33:39.770
not gorge themselves on sugary biscuits.

33:39.820 --> 33:43.100
Baby appears to be in a
posterior position, Shelagh.

33:48.340 --> 33:52.450
His spine is lying along your spine,
which may make for a longer labour.

33:52.500 --> 33:55.450
I knew it. I knew it
before you even checked.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.100
I've been palpating my
own abdomen for weeks.

34:16.100 --> 34:17.889
Mr Goddens?

34:17.940 --> 34:19.659
Can I go in? Can I see her?

34:21.340 --> 34:24.170
I'm afraid your wife's still
with the heart specialist.

34:24.219 --> 34:27.489
The tests suggest she may have
suffered a pulmonary embolism.

34:27.540 --> 34:28.889
Well, what's that?

34:28.940 --> 34:31.530
It's when a blood clot
forms somewhere in the body

34:31.580 --> 34:33.370
and travels up to the chest

34:33.420 --> 34:35.969
and interferes with the
breathing and circulation.

34:36.020 --> 34:38.210
Well, can you operate? Can you cut it out?

34:38.260 --> 34:42.179
We can try treating her with a
blood-thinning drug called Heparin.

34:44.620 --> 34:47.570
Do you have any children, Mr Goddens?

34:47.620 --> 34:49.179
Three girls.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.489
Wilma's sister's minding them.

34:52.540 --> 34:54.570
I don't want them seeing her again.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.929
She looks so bad I'm
scared she'll scare 'em!

34:56.980 --> 34:58.580
Mr Goddens...

35:01.060 --> 35:02.900
.. are they nearby?

35:14.820 --> 35:16.570
Turner's residence.

35:16.620 --> 35:20.650
Ah, hello! I just wondered
how she was getting on?

35:20.700 --> 35:24.010
Things are ticking over
very nicely, Dr Turner.

35:24.060 --> 35:25.610
Could I speak to her?

35:25.660 --> 35:27.930
She's smiling and waving!

35:27.980 --> 35:30.420
But we'll telephone if there's any news.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.050
I'm afraid Wilma's struggling to breathe

35:39.100 --> 35:41.730
because of the blood clot in her chest.

35:41.780 --> 35:45.010
If we perform a procedure
called a tracheotomy

35:45.060 --> 35:48.570
we'll be able to get oxygen
directly into her windpipe.

35:48.620 --> 35:51.780
The doctor's going to bring you
a consent form for you to sign.

36:01.740 --> 36:04.420
Is there anyone else you'd
like us to send for?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.480
She was brought up a churchgoer.

36:12.820 --> 36:18.010
Well done, well done,
you're coping beautifully.

36:18.060 --> 36:20.220
I don't feel as though I am.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.810
You're unpacking the
gas and air, aren't you?

36:26.860 --> 36:29.370
I know the sound the
catch on that case makes.

36:29.420 --> 36:31.780
- Would you like some pethidine?
- Yes.

36:33.820 --> 36:36.810
I thought I'd be braver than this.

36:36.860 --> 36:40.970
This has nothing to do with bravery
and more to do with common sense.

36:41.020 --> 36:43.850
The baby's head is not
sitting well on the cervix

36:43.900 --> 36:45.490
and it's slowing things down.

36:45.540 --> 36:48.900
Oh, please, please can
I have the pethidine?

36:52.460 --> 36:55.340
As soon as this one's over, I promise you.

37:22.460 --> 37:24.890
We understand from speaking to Dr Turner

37:24.940 --> 37:27.530
that Wilma went to the Family
Contraceptive Clinic recently

37:27.580 --> 37:30.770
and was prescribed the contraceptive pill?

37:30.820 --> 37:33.610
I don't think so.

37:33.660 --> 37:36.010
It would be useful if we knew for certain.

37:36.060 --> 37:38.610
The specialist says
that over the past year

37:38.660 --> 37:41.330
other women taking these drugs
have suffered blood clots.

37:41.380 --> 37:43.810
They're trying to find out
if there's a connection.

37:43.860 --> 37:46.650
Why would she take contraceptives?

37:46.700 --> 37:48.260
I wanted a son.

37:58.420 --> 38:00.850
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

38:00.900 --> 38:04.370
who gave commandment to the
church to heal the sick,

38:04.420 --> 38:07.610
of His great mercy make thee whole,

38:07.660 --> 38:12.010
and by his authority committed
unto me I anoint thee,

38:12.060 --> 38:16.850
that thou mayest be
healed of thy infirmities,

38:16.900 --> 38:23.330
in the name of the Father, and
of the Son and the Holy Ghost.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.900
- Amen.
- Amen.

38:36.700 --> 38:41.050
Mr Goddens and the children
will have to come in soon, Tom.

38:41.100 --> 38:43.740
There's something I have to do first.

38:51.900 --> 38:57.650
You're doing so well. Well
done. That's it, just breathe.

38:57.700 --> 39:01.380
Just breathe. There we go. There we go.

39:19.860 --> 39:22.980
An enviable complexion, if I may say so.

39:24.220 --> 39:27.220
You've obviously been very
diligent with the cold cream.

39:30.540 --> 39:32.900
Bit of rouge next, I think, sweetie.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.980
And then I'll do your hair.

39:46.580 --> 39:49.620
I'll just look in your bag
to see if you brought a comb.

40:05.740 --> 40:08.970
That's it! That's it, use
all of the contraction,

40:09.020 --> 40:11.020
don't waste a moment of it.

40:13.740 --> 40:16.490
I can't believe I used to dream of this.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.370
It's like a nightmare.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.570
You're doing better than you think.

40:20.620 --> 40:22.290
- Am I?
- Yes.

40:22.340 --> 40:26.740
And if you want to keep the pain at
bay, you can always try the singing.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.460
So many songs seem to belong
to the woman I was before.

40:33.420 --> 40:35.700
Shelagh, the religious sister.

40:37.420 --> 40:40.250
Shelagh, who thought
she'd never have a child.

40:40.300 --> 40:43.570
And you still are all of those people.

40:43.620 --> 40:50.580
Every woman alive is the sum of
all she ever did and felt and was.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.210
How do you know that?

40:55.260 --> 40:58.180
I wasn't aware I did, until just now.

41:05.940 --> 41:10.220
♪ Once I had a secret love

41:13.220 --> 41:17.500
♪ That lived within the heart of me

41:19.580 --> 41:23.740
♪ All too soon my secret love

41:25.580 --> 41:30.020
♪ Became impatient to be free

41:32.700 --> 41:37.660
♪ So I told a friendly star

41:40.020 --> 41:44.500
♪ The way that dreamers often do

41:47.900 --> 41:52.940
♪ Just how wonderful you are

41:54.860 --> 42:00.500
♪ And why I'm so in love with you. ♪

42:02.540 --> 42:04.620
I'd like him to come in now.

42:06.980 --> 42:11.580
We can't be just like any other
couple... because we're us.

42:19.700 --> 42:24.020
No need to tiptoe. Mummy's
quite tired, she won't wake up.

42:35.860 --> 42:38.170
Your children are here, Wilma.

42:38.220 --> 42:41.420
They've come for a cuddle
and to say goodnight.

43:10.380 --> 43:11.860
Breathe, Shelagh.

43:13.940 --> 43:17.140
Gently, gently, gently.

43:22.860 --> 43:25.210
And baby's head's born!

43:25.260 --> 43:26.900
- Is it? - Yes! - Is it?

43:30.500 --> 43:32.380
You clever girl!

43:35.540 --> 43:37.660
It is so, so beautiful!

43:43.740 --> 43:45.570
Sh. That's it.

43:45.620 --> 43:47.380
You'll know when you're ready.

44:10.340 --> 44:12.220
You have a son.

44:13.460 --> 44:14.940
Oh!

44:17.940 --> 44:19.700
Hello.

44:24.300 --> 44:28.250
May the Lord bless you and keep you...

44:28.300 --> 44:30.530
Oh, God!

44:30.580 --> 44:34.020
.. and may the Lord make His
face to shine upon you...

44:36.580 --> 44:38.620
.. and give you peace.

45:18.660 --> 45:23.090
I know you and I probably have
different ideas about miracles,

45:23.140 --> 45:25.970
but I honestly thought
that's what the pill was.

45:26.020 --> 45:30.850
And if the doctors are right, if
there are issues over its safety,

45:30.900 --> 45:34.730
then I'm suspending all belief
in miracles until further notice.

45:34.780 --> 45:37.450
I'll look in on the
family at home tomorrow.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.930
People are always in shock
after a sudden death

45:39.980 --> 45:42.050
and there's always so
much organising to do.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.610
Haven't you got a bit of organising
of your own to do tomorrow?

45:44.660 --> 45:46.370
You get married the next day.

45:46.420 --> 45:48.690
Oh, everything seems to
have fallen into place.

45:48.740 --> 45:50.820
I shan't tell Barbara you said that.

45:53.460 --> 45:57.690
It's funny to think it could've been
you and me getting married, once.

45:57.740 --> 45:59.370
No, Tom.

45:59.420 --> 46:01.770
It isn't funny at all.

46:01.820 --> 46:04.290
You and Barbara are so much better suited.

46:04.340 --> 46:06.290
I know.

46:06.340 --> 46:08.810
I do have high hopes for
you and Christopher, though.

46:08.860 --> 46:09.940
Do you?

46:11.460 --> 46:13.330
It isn't straightforward.

46:13.380 --> 46:15.930
- There's a child involved.
- Good.

46:15.980 --> 46:18.090
Cos you're wonderful with children.

46:18.140 --> 46:21.460
And if I didn't know that
before tonight, I know it now.

46:27.420 --> 46:30.330
I've lined up four buckets
of water in the scullery.

46:30.380 --> 46:32.450
Had I better go and fill a couple more?

46:32.500 --> 46:35.890
It transpired you delivered the
flower stall chap's youngest.

46:35.940 --> 46:37.410
It was breech.

46:37.460 --> 46:38.810
Plus he's my second cousin.

46:38.860 --> 46:42.060
- What with one thing and another,
we got reduced rates. - Oh!

46:43.820 --> 46:48.130
There she is. The focus of our
attentions and our prayers.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.460
Daddy!

46:52.980 --> 46:56.220
- Hello. - How do you
do? - Arthur Gilbert.

47:00.940 --> 47:03.940
I, I'm so sorry for your loss, Mr Goddens.

47:05.460 --> 47:09.450
I've brought some hair ribbons
for the children for...

47:09.500 --> 47:11.180
For the funeral.

47:13.380 --> 47:15.970
They're not black. They're navy.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.780
Wilma favoured navy.

47:20.180 --> 47:21.860
She was so smart.

47:23.300 --> 47:24.860
So lovely.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.490
Alexandra and I had a
lovely time last week.

47:44.540 --> 47:48.690
It was her birthday, so I took her
to Harrods and bought her a rabbit.

47:48.740 --> 47:50.250
Oh, how lovely.

47:50.300 --> 47:52.530
I had a rabbit when I was a little girl,

47:52.580 --> 47:55.330
but it got shut in the
cupboard under the stairs.

47:55.380 --> 47:58.050
Did it die?

47:58.100 --> 48:00.810
Oh, good gracious, no!

48:00.860 --> 48:03.130
I heard him squeaking,
and so I let him out.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.370
We were best friends forever after that,

48:05.420 --> 48:08.810
he used to let me push him
around in my doll's pram.

48:08.860 --> 48:11.810
I like your nail varnish.

48:11.860 --> 48:13.530
Oh, do you?

48:13.580 --> 48:15.850
It said, "Crushed
Strawberries" on the bottle,

48:15.900 --> 48:17.330
but by the time I'd put it on,

48:17.380 --> 48:20.610
it looked more like "Squashed Tomatoes!"

48:20.660 --> 48:23.610
I think I need someone to
help me choose a different one.

48:23.660 --> 48:25.890
Perhaps we could go and look in Boots,

48:25.940 --> 48:28.980
after we've eaten our
knickerbocker glories.

48:37.420 --> 48:39.370
You're early, Fred.

48:39.420 --> 48:42.530
There's a Battenberg cake by
the kettle that wants a home.

48:42.580 --> 48:44.020
Smashing.

48:51.220 --> 48:52.740
Just a moment!

48:56.740 --> 48:59.900
- Oh, hello, Reggie love.
- Hello, Mum!

49:11.220 --> 49:16.730
Sister Monica Joan, Barbara's a
bride, not the Queen of the May!

49:16.780 --> 49:20.090
If our young friend is to
be married from this house,

49:20.140 --> 49:23.930
she will depart it as we see fit.

49:23.980 --> 49:26.090
And if she is to depart it in my vehicle,

49:26.140 --> 49:28.620
it will be decorated with restraint.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.570
All right, Reverend?

49:39.620 --> 49:42.330
I heard your best man's not
turning up until the morning,

49:42.380 --> 49:47.250
so, you, me, the Parish Men's
Group and a few tail-enders,

49:47.300 --> 49:50.490
- how about it?
- How about what?

49:50.540 --> 49:53.970
A quick round in the Black Sail, one
for the road in the Hand and Shears,

49:54.020 --> 49:58.980
and then off to Walthamstow
dogs, stag party done and dusted.

50:00.820 --> 50:04.210
One, two, three, one, two,
three, one, two, three...

50:04.260 --> 50:07.290
I got away with heading the
conga line at Margaret's wedding,

50:07.340 --> 50:10.530
but I think nuns will expect
a slightly more decorous

50:10.580 --> 50:12.330
father-daughter dance.

50:12.380 --> 50:14.530
I think they'll love it whatever we do.

50:14.580 --> 50:16.810
Have they been giving you lots of advice?

50:16.860 --> 50:19.300
Not on marriage, surprisingly enough.

50:20.660 --> 50:24.450
The person I'd really like
to ask for advice is-is you.

50:24.500 --> 50:28.730
You and Mum were so
happy, for so many years.

50:28.780 --> 50:30.220
I know.

50:35.060 --> 50:37.500
But my bally head's gone blank.

50:41.260 --> 50:42.810

51:18.460 --> 51:20.370
We've drawn up a rota for the bathroom.

51:20.420 --> 51:22.690
10 minutes each, but
you're last, so you get 20.

51:22.740 --> 51:26.140
And no-one's allowed to take
their rollers out until I say so!

51:29.300 --> 51:31.730
Ah, there she is!

51:31.780 --> 51:35.450
I was rather hoping for a
vision in white, having braved

51:35.500 --> 51:37.170
the gorgon at my lodgings

51:37.220 --> 51:39.810
and the gaggle of gorgons
at the portals here.

51:39.860 --> 51:42.690
Good practice for New Guinea.

51:42.740 --> 51:45.490
I was last for the bathroom,
but we've run out of hot water.

51:45.540 --> 51:48.530
Valerie's boiling kettles and
we've formed a human chain.

51:48.580 --> 51:51.220
- It's actually quite good fun.
- Oh, bless you.

51:53.020 --> 51:56.810
You sounded just like your
mother when you said that.

51:56.860 --> 52:02.340
People had her down as a sensible
sort, but she was so, so lovely.

52:04.900 --> 52:06.740
You asked for my advice...

52:09.340 --> 52:11.290
.. but you don't need it

52:11.340 --> 52:15.460
because you find joy in the simple things.

52:18.380 --> 52:21.740
That's all love needs
to thrive on, really.

52:31.340 --> 52:33.730
Morning, Reverend, you're looking rough.

52:33.780 --> 52:37.690
My best man just made me
eat a fried egg sandwich.

52:37.740 --> 52:39.890
You don't look too good yourself.

52:39.940 --> 52:43.170
Violet told me not to come home drunk.

52:43.220 --> 52:46.980
And I was drunk, so I didn't go home.

52:48.300 --> 52:52.100
I've got your ill-gotten
gains here from the dogs.

52:55.020 --> 52:58.010
You've got a knack of spotting
form, I'll give you that.

52:58.060 --> 53:00.650
I think I just picked
them for their names.

53:00.700 --> 53:03.660
Galilee Lad and Hello Nurse!

53:05.740 --> 53:08.060
It all comes flooding back to me.

53:09.900 --> 53:11.700
Get the missus something nice.

54:09.940 --> 54:11.860
Please be seated.

54:27.820 --> 54:29.490
Why aren't we driving to the door?

54:29.540 --> 54:32.740
Trust me, and close your eyes.

54:43.580 --> 54:44.860
Open them.

54:52.500 --> 54:54.860
Did you do all of this for me?

54:57.220 --> 54:59.540
