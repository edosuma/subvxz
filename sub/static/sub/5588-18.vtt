WEBVTT

00:03.269 --> 00:06.538
(gasps)
there is my favorite girl!

00:06.540 --> 00:08.540
I'm so excited
about our spa weekend!

00:08.542 --> 00:09.942
Oh, me too.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.310
If you think of it
while you're there,

00:11.312 --> 00:12.711
I'm dangerously low
on sunscreen powder.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.279
Powder?

00:14.281 --> 00:15.614
You know, you won't be smirking
10 years from now

00:15.616 --> 00:17.816
When your face looks like
an old apple.

00:17.818 --> 00:21.120
I just got my first perk as
c.E.O. Of pritchett's closets.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.222
I finished a big job for a spa,

00:23.224 --> 00:27.359
And as a thank-you, they sent me
a free weekend for two.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.962
Phil's too ticklish
for massages, though.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.730
But I am not!

00:31.732 --> 00:33.899
I heard it's the place
where all the stars go

00:33.901 --> 00:36.802
To get hot mud poured
into their faces.

00:36.804 --> 00:40.472
I just can't wait to see this
one without makeup. (chuckles)

00:40.474 --> 00:43.308
You do, it will be the last
thing that you will ever see.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.710
(chuckles)

00:44.712 --> 00:48.080
I remember my first big perk
for a job well-done.

00:48.082 --> 00:51.216
I had upgraded some closets
for guy who created "alf."
hmm.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.552
And six weeks later,
I'm watching the show.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.588
There's alf sassing
this handsome mailman

00:56.590 --> 00:57.923
Named jay pritchett.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.558
I still got it
on betamax.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.560
I remember. You showed it to me
on our first date.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.195
(cameron
clears throat)

01:03.197 --> 01:04.596
Hey.
Hey.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.899
Jay, you ready to watch
the, uh, fight together?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.333
Yep.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.669
Just two of us.
Mm.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.404
I had the perfect night
planned --

01:12.406 --> 01:14.540
Alone, pay-per-view boxing --

01:14.542 --> 01:17.509
The pride of ireland
versus a cuban sensation.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.212
In the ring
and in my bloodstream.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.848
Then gloria and mitchell
got involved.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.784
Jay, cam is gonna
watch the fight, too.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.853
Why don't you two
watch it together?

01:27.855 --> 01:28.954
Oh, good, because cam
was just gonna

01:28.956 --> 01:30.456
Watch from a bar
by himself.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.057
I love it. It's gonna be like
you have a date!

01:32.059 --> 01:33.592
(giggles)

01:33.594 --> 01:35.561
I don't know what it is,
but jay gets uncomfortable

01:35.563 --> 01:37.463
When it's just the two of us.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.232
And then I get uncomfortable,

01:40.234 --> 01:42.101
And I feel like
I have to say something.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.036
Perfect. Yeah.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.208
Today's
hitler's birthday.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.744
Mitchell,
we're going!

01:52.746 --> 01:55.314
(sighs) where is phil?
The theater's gonna be packed.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.749
Honey, your nerd friend
is waiting.

01:57.751 --> 02:01.086
(laughs evilly)
who dare invoke my name?

02:01.088 --> 02:02.221
That's my cue.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.056
It is I,
your destroyer!

02:04.058 --> 02:05.958
(chuckles) hey, lily,
you sure you don't want

02:05.960 --> 02:07.459
To go to the movies with us?
Last chance.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.827
What is it about again?

02:08.829 --> 02:11.096
The defenders of infinity
are heroes

02:11.098 --> 02:12.731
From several
different time streams

02:12.733 --> 02:14.166
That make their way
into the future without --

02:14.168 --> 02:15.667
Um, it's not really
the future

02:15.669 --> 02:17.603
Since the streams
have always coexisted.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.072
Don't do that. Don't treat me
like I'm a lobotomorph.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.473
Lily, you don't want
to go.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.741
You'll be the only girl
in the theater.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.076
All right,
you guys should head out.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.477
We would love to.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.079
Oh, and don't worry.

02:27.081 --> 02:29.314
Lily's babysitters have
a big night planned --

02:29.316 --> 02:32.084
Puzzles, ping-pong,
board games.

02:32.086 --> 02:34.319
Are we still in that "let
manny win or he cries" phase?

02:34.321 --> 02:35.921
No.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.589
We should get going. Are
we taking separate time streams?

02:37.591 --> 02:39.024
Sure, if we want
to get there yesterday.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.926
(both laugh)

02:41.761 --> 02:45.497
--   <font color="#ffff00">Captions by vita</font>--

02:45.499 --> 02:49.334
â™ª

02:55.808 --> 02:57.276
Ah, there's something
so relaxing

02:57.278 --> 02:58.544
About a bowl
of green apples.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.946
I already forgot
all my problems.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.682
(drawer squeaks quietly)
did you hear that?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.684
What?
Exactly.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.620
We used whisperquiet gliders
in all the drawers.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.190
Oh, really cuts down
on c.N. --

03:11.192 --> 03:13.225
It's industry jargon
for "closet noise."

03:13.227 --> 03:15.694
Does that technology work
on people, too?

03:15.696 --> 03:16.828
(cellphone chiming)
you're right.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.031
I promise --
no more shop talk.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.033
What is this?
Oh.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.968
Our smoke alarm
went off at home.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.369
I'm sure it's nothing,

03:24.371 --> 03:27.139
But I'm still gonna call luke
just in case.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.141
And it's straight
to voicemail.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.810
Hello, manny. We saw
that the smoke alarm went off.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.045
Are you okay?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.580
Oh, god.
Luke's outgoing message

03:34.582 --> 03:36.682
Is a long
and vaguely sexist rap.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.084
Okay, papi.
Stay perfect!

03:39.086 --> 03:40.752
Ay.
Everything is okay.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.055
They were baking cookies
and they burned a batch.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.090
Oh. All right.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.192
Except our oven
isn't working.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.328
Manny would never lie.
You know what?

03:49.330 --> 03:52.097
I am gonna call
for a russian masseuse.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.199
Their hands are very strong
from wringing laundry.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.068
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Think about it.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.270
They were very eager
to get us out of the house.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.705
They're up to something.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.039
You are too suspicious.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.841
And you
are too trusting!

04:02.843 --> 04:04.576
Luke's already been arrested
this year.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.445
A few weeks ago,
we caught him with beer.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.347
Even that's a better rap.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.183
I'm hearing a lot of luke's name
and none of manny.

04:11.185 --> 04:12.751
You don't think manny's
up to the same things

04:12.753 --> 04:14.019
When you're not
paying attention?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.754
You're crazy.
Manny hates beer.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.122
A fruity beaujolais then.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.457
You can do
whatever you want.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.625
I'm gonna go
check on my kid.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.361
(sighs)

04:24.597 --> 04:25.964
(drawer squeaks quietly)

04:25.966 --> 04:29.101
I hate how good
those gliders are!

04:30.203 --> 04:32.271
(indistinct conversations)

04:35.241 --> 04:37.109
I am so excited.
I feel like a teenager.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.244
Me too.
Although, as torf the ancient,

04:39.246 --> 04:42.381
I have seen everything
from the great star explosion

04:42.383 --> 04:43.782
To the seven moon alliance.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.550
Claire was right.
No girls.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.319
Phil?
James!

04:47.321 --> 04:48.387
Hey.
What's up?

04:48.389 --> 04:50.222
(laughs)

04:50.224 --> 04:51.923
I sold this cool cat a house
in the hills last year.
Ah.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.126
Since then, his bluegrass band
has really taken off.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.061
It's so crazy.
We started doing it ironically,

04:56.063 --> 04:57.996
And before we knew it, we
were actually doing it for real.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.332
That happened to me in the '90s
with saying, "exsqueeze me."

05:00.334 --> 05:01.900
Oh.
Yeah.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.002
Well, I assume from
your torf the ancient costume,

05:04.004 --> 05:06.672
And your
pale slave getup...
Not a costume.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.241
...That you guys are here to see
"defenders of infinity."

05:09.243 --> 05:10.342
Oh, yeah!
Yeah.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.443
Oh, it is
so incredible!

05:11.445 --> 05:12.811
Really?
Yeah.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.246
Hey, if you really want
to be blown away,

05:14.248 --> 05:16.848
I've got two special gummy bears
you can have.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.450
Just one
for each of us?

05:18.452 --> 05:19.985
Believe me.
One is all you need.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.120
I guess we can get more
at the concession stand.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.589
No, they don't sell gummy bears
like these here.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.458
Ohhh.
(chuckles)

05:26.460 --> 05:29.528
You get extra cool ones
from europe or something.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.331
Guys, how are you
not getting this? It's pot.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.801
Together: Ohhhh.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.503
I don't know why,
but I've never tried marijuana.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.871
No.
No, me neither.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.140
Th-there was always
something stopping me --

05:42.142 --> 05:43.809
Needing to take care
of lily,

05:43.811 --> 05:45.544
The figure-skating
honor code,

05:45.546 --> 05:47.612
Not wanting to accidentally tell
everyone in high school

05:47.614 --> 05:49.014
I was gay.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.782
People never offered it to me,
which is weird

05:50.784 --> 05:53.452
Because in college, I was
kind of a big man on campus.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.520
I founded
a major organization --

05:55.522 --> 05:59.558
The national association
of responsible cheerleaders.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.227
Uh, narcs.
Yeah.

06:02.229 --> 06:05.397
Here. They take 45 minutes
to hit, so take them now,

06:05.399 --> 06:06.565
And you'll be good to go
when the movie starts.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.967
Okay.
(chuckles)

06:08.969 --> 06:13.171
Um, you know, if --
if we ever were gonna try this,

06:13.173 --> 06:15.407
Tonight's kind of
the perfect opportunity.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.008
I guess you're right.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.578
No kids.
I'm wearing velcro sneakers.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.979
(chuckling)
should we?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.881
I've always wanted to know
what it would be like.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.916
Plus, I went
to the gym today.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.551
I deserve a sweet.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.586
Let's do it.
Okay.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.653
(chuckles)

06:28.655 --> 06:30.055
I'm shaking.
Thank you.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.857
(both chuckle)

06:31.859 --> 06:33.258
Cheers.
Cheersies.

06:34.994 --> 06:36.661
(giggles)
subtle.

06:36.663 --> 06:37.996
Chew smaller.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.665
'sup?

06:43.603 --> 06:45.370
(cellphone buzzes)
(chuckling)
oh, my god.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.105
I cannot believe we're
doing this. This is so exciting.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.540
Uh-oh.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.075
Oh, god. I knew this was
a horrible mistake.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.511
I just got an alert.
Our smoke alarm when off!

06:52.513 --> 06:55.247
(coughing)
(blowing)

06:55.249 --> 06:56.581
It's not coming up.
(spits)

06:56.583 --> 06:58.617
Okay, okay.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.753
Relax. I'm gonna -- I'm gonna
call luke, find out what's up.
Yeah.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.525
Voicemail.
(sighs)

07:06.527 --> 07:08.894
(chuckles)
this rap's hilarious, though.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.562
Call claire.
She's not home.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.897
We're gonna have to
check this out.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.799
No, come on.
Those alerts are always nothing.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.768
Plus...
(whispering) our crime.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.703
Listen, we have
assigned seats

07:18.705 --> 07:20.872
And 45 minutes
till this kicks in.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.941
That gives us plenty of time
to uber home,

07:22.943 --> 07:25.243
Make sure everything's fine,
touch up my veins, and get back.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.546
I'll set an alarm so we know
exactly when it hits.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.781
No, you're right. Lily's there.
Yes, yes. Let's go.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.216
Plus, we're not gonna
want to deal with this

07:31.218 --> 07:32.384
When we're high
and paranoid.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.885
Oh. Oh, god.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.221
Do you think the paranoia
will be bad?

07:41.561 --> 07:44.596
(bell dings,
boxing announcer talking on tv)

07:44.598 --> 07:47.098
So, how's
the closet business?

07:47.100 --> 07:50.068
I retired two months ago.
Right. Right.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.807
Uh, getting our carpets cleaned
next month.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.278
Oh, come on.
That's ridiculous.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.847
Hernandez has this fight
in the bag.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.248
Yeah, it's gonna be
such a cakewalk.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.416
He shouldn't even
be getting paid for it.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.017
Can you believe
these guys?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.320
Hey, no disrespect, but
if o'brien's even halfway sober,

08:08.322 --> 08:10.188
He takes
hernandez apart.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.857
Yeah, he's got
a better reach, better jab,

08:11.859 --> 08:13.825
And I haven't seen feet
that fast since riverdance.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.660
You guys seem
pretty confident.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.629
Uh, care to make
a friendly $10 bet?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.431
We'll take it.
Easiest money I ever made.
Yeah.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.966
You're crazy.
O'brien is a mook.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.300
Well, hernandez is
a palooka.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.102
I'd rather be a palooka
than a mook.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.938
Well, that's a lot of talk
coming from a couple jabronis.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.043
Cam, calm down.
We're just having fun here.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.279
Really?
That's -- that's the line?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.815
(cheering)

08:36.817 --> 08:38.015
What happened?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.650
Damn it!
O'brien knocked him out!

08:39.653 --> 08:41.686
Already?
We missed the whole thing!

08:41.688 --> 08:43.154
We're backed up
in the kitchen.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.723
Sorry, guys.
Your food's gonna be a while.

08:47.493 --> 08:48.960
I thought about leaving,

08:48.962 --> 08:50.529
But I didn't want
to make jay feel bad.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.597
I had a sandwich coming.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.704
I told you.
Nothing!

08:59.706 --> 09:02.707
A little too much nothing,
if you ask me.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.579
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

09:07.581 --> 09:09.414
I forgot my slippers.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.982
Doesn't the hotel
have slippers?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.551
I'll be
asking the questions.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.386
How did you manage
to burn chocolate-chip cookies

09:14.388 --> 09:15.820
In an oven
that doesn't work?

09:15.822 --> 09:18.023
Oh, manny
meant pancakes.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.791
We're making
chocolate-chip pancakes.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.698
You see?
Now, let's go.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.901
Somebody named olga should be
salting me like a pretzel!

09:29.903 --> 09:31.503
Mm.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.605
Mm-hmm.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.941
Is everything okay?

09:35.943 --> 09:38.009
Oh, yes.
It was just a false alarm.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.511
Well, then we should probably
get back to the theater.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.079
Those pre-movie
trivia questions

09:41.081 --> 09:42.847
Aren't gonna answer themselves,
are they? (chuckles)

09:42.849 --> 09:44.516
Actually, they do.
Wait a minute!

09:46.052 --> 09:49.020
What the hell is
going on...

09:49.022 --> 09:51.256
Here, huh?

09:51.258 --> 09:52.891
(sniffs) yep.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.960
I smell cheap beer.
Someone's been having a party.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.362
Claire, you're
just being crazy.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.598
Take a look around!
Nothing is going on!

09:59.600 --> 10:01.866
There is no party!

10:01.868 --> 10:03.835
Everyone just be cool!

10:06.906 --> 10:09.240
See that story
about the one-armed golfer?
No.

10:09.242 --> 10:13.211
Yeah, well,
it's this guy and he's...

10:13.213 --> 10:15.981
Well, I guess that's it.
He's -- he's a one-armed golfer.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.549
Oh.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.619
How backed up
is that kitchen?!

10:20.621 --> 10:22.087
Hey!
These guys!

10:22.089 --> 10:23.555
Hey, you rascals.
Get over here.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.056
We're on our way out.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.825
No! Don't you want a chance
to win your money back?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.226
It's 5 bucks each.
We're good.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.327
No! Come on!

10:29.329 --> 10:30.495
It'll be fun.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.830
Dude,
you're hurting my arm.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.331
No, a game of foosball,
double or nothing.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.566
I don't think --
you're on!
Let's go!

10:34.568 --> 10:35.667
Let's go!

10:35.669 --> 10:38.303
Phil, uh,
how long do we have?

10:38.305 --> 10:39.804
17 minutes.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.306
Till the movie,
is what we're talking about.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.575
We're just two guys
seeing a movie.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.343
No one's leaving here until
we get to the bottom of this.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.579
Oh, my god.
Somebody give me a back rub!

10:47.581 --> 10:49.314
Manny! Luke!
Get in here!

10:49.316 --> 10:51.149
You guys go search the house.
Find something suspicious.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.951
Is this gonna be like
loading the dishwasher?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.152
First I load it,
then you reload it?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.487
Wouldn't it be faster
if you actually --

10:55.489 --> 10:56.921
Phil, go!

10:56.923 --> 10:58.990
What's so important?
I'm sitting for my portrait.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.027
Oh, knock it off.
I know you two threw a party.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.762
I don't "throw"
a party, claire.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.330
It's true.
He can't throw anything.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.631
And if I were hosting
an event,

11:06.633 --> 11:07.999
Where did I put
the ice sculpture?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.668
Where did I stash
the hors d'oeuvres?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.603
Where did I hide
the jazz trio?

11:11.605 --> 11:13.972
Good question, considering you
couldn't even hide...

11:13.974 --> 11:15.807
The solo.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.375
Nice wordplay, mom,

11:17.377 --> 11:19.377
But that cup's been there
for like three days.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.780
I didn't want to say anything
'cause I thought it was yours.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.650
Yeah.
It was bold.

11:25.652 --> 11:28.119
But those kids upstairs weren't
gonna stay quiet forever.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.821
I was one
dead phone battery away

11:29.823 --> 11:31.623
From a conversation
breaking out.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.992
(chuckles)

11:33.994 --> 11:35.794
Sure, throwing a party
was a risk,

11:35.796 --> 11:38.730
But two hot exchange students
just started at our school.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.632
Best part is,
they don't understand

11:40.634 --> 11:42.534
Just how uncool we are.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.169
Yet.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.804
So, we were walking
down the hallway

11:45.806 --> 11:47.005
When we stopped
by the locker --

11:47.007 --> 11:48.640
Ohh, pizza day.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.810
Mmm.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.714
That's our
personal trainer.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.482
He hates it
when we eat carbs.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.351
We had a short window.
We needed to impress them fast.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.821
So, we bribed lily with
all the soda she could drink

12:02.823 --> 12:04.355
And threw a party.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.391
It was going great
until someone set off the alarm

12:06.393 --> 12:08.893
Because he just had to smoke
his dorky pipe.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.763
Dorky? Yeah, because hugh hefner
doesn't get girls.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.098
(scoffs)

12:13.100 --> 12:15.233
I love you, too, mommy.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.436
All clear, party people!

12:18.438 --> 12:20.438
(indistinct conversations)

12:20.440 --> 12:21.840
I told her
we were baking cookies.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.608
Dude,
our oven's broken.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.111
My mom's definitely gonna
get suspicious and check on us.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.612
That means
my mom's coming, too.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.080
I'll get everyone
to leave,

12:29.082 --> 12:31.382
You get rid of the beer
and your idea of a spread.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.852
Wait.
We're not giving up yet.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.720
The beer pong tournament
just started,

12:35.722 --> 12:37.589
The girls are laughing
at all of our jokes,

12:37.591 --> 12:40.692
And they think we're friends
with guys like tommy cutahee.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.026
Great party, lewis.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.595
Thanks, tommy.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.130
From now on, I'm lewis.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.698
We're going to get caught
if we do nothing.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.133
What if we hide everyone
long enough

12:48.135 --> 12:49.400
For my mom to check on us
and then leave?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.369
It's not worth it.

12:51.371 --> 12:55.707
(european accent)
guys, when do we play
seven hours in heaven?

12:55.709 --> 12:59.277
Moving the party upstairs,
people!

13:00.379 --> 13:01.946
Okay. No one's here.
Okay.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.748
(alarm beeps)
is that
your watch alarm?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.150
We have to
get out of here!

13:05.152 --> 13:06.718
I do not want to be high
in front of claire!

13:06.720 --> 13:07.919
Wait.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.420
I think
I'm feeling something.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.055
Oh, no.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.158
What are you feeling?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.225
Nice.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.827
Oh, god.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.328
Are you
feeling anything?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.930
No.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.331
Then why are you leaning
like that?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.900
I'm not leaning.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.468
Maybe you're leaning
so it looks like I'm leaning.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.174
Oh, yeah.
You're right.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.009
Claire:
Phil, what are you doing?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.243
Still searching!

13:32.245 --> 13:34.245
Anything suspicious?
Say nothing.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.347
Okay.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.849
Phil?

13:37.851 --> 13:39.617
Answer her!
You said "say nothing."

13:39.619 --> 13:41.820
I mean say
the word "nothing."
<i>word.</i>

13:44.190 --> 13:46.691
Nothing!

13:46.693 --> 13:49.093
That was so good.
Thanks, man.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.196
Okay, phillip.
Focus.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.964
We have to finish
searching this house

13:52.966 --> 13:55.333
Before we start
acting weird or...

13:57.036 --> 13:58.136
Yeah.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.038
Nothing!

14:00.040 --> 14:02.207
That was so great.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.676
Yeah, I learned
from the best.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.778
Come on, you jerk. Get in there,
you son of a bitch!

14:06.780 --> 14:09.047
Oh, yeah, baby.
Here we go.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.481
That's what your sister
said last night

14:10.483 --> 14:11.549
When I was banging her.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.218
What?!
Aw, damn it, vic!

14:13.220 --> 14:15.386
(both laugh)

14:15.388 --> 14:18.223
(laughing)
cam was banging vic's sister.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.657
(laughs)

14:19.659 --> 14:21.626
Classic!

14:24.864 --> 14:26.798
Oh,
just hit it already.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.833
That's what your sister said
to cam last night

14:28.835 --> 14:30.235
When he was banging her.
Did I do it?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.970
(laughing)
you're so good!

14:31.972 --> 14:33.805
(laughs) yes!

14:35.474 --> 14:38.743
Manny, manny...Manny.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.879
How did we get here?

14:40.881 --> 14:42.814
You're a good kid.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.415
You didn't have anything
to do with this.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.085
You were in the wrong place
at the wrong time. Am I right?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.053
But someone's going down
for this.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.357
You think it'll be
the white kid? Hmm?

14:52.359 --> 14:54.158
(whispering)
psst! Claire!

14:57.830 --> 14:59.564
What are you doing?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.399
I am trying
to get to the truth.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.401
The only way I'm gonna find out
what really happened here

15:03.403 --> 15:05.270
Is to get those two clowns
to turn on each other.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.771
Nothing happened here!

15:06.773 --> 15:07.906
And even if it had,

15:07.908 --> 15:10.341
Manny's not gonna rat out
his best friend!

15:10.343 --> 15:12.677
(whispering)
I think I'm gonna take the deal.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.945
(whispering) no!

15:13.947 --> 15:15.179
You cave,
we don't stand a chance

15:15.181 --> 15:16.681
With those
exchange students.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.583
Those girls don't respect
weak, little nerds

15:18.585 --> 15:20.351
Afraid of being punished
by their mommies.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.853
They've
lived through wars.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.254
They're from portugal!

15:26.025 --> 15:27.392
(whispering)
whoa. I heard something.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.527
Did you hear something?

15:29.529 --> 15:30.795
No.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.331
Am I screaming
right now?

15:35.134 --> 15:36.734
No.
Okay.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.636
Stay cool.
We're almost out of here.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.609
All clear.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.144
Let's just check
luke's room.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.846
Then we can tell claire
we didn't find anything.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.450
(keg clanks)

15:55.421 --> 15:57.722
Okay, there's two ways
we can play this.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.123
Okay.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.097
(whispering) okay, if we tell
claire about those kids,

16:06.099 --> 16:07.665
We're gonna have to stay here
and punish manny

16:07.667 --> 16:08.766
And the, uh --
the other one.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.802
That's no good!
(exhales shakily)

16:10.804 --> 16:13.404
I don't think we can hide
our crime!

16:13.406 --> 16:14.672
Well, then what if
we don't tell her?

16:14.674 --> 16:15.740
Does -- does that make us
bad parents?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.342
Or are we bad parents

16:17.344 --> 16:19.143
Because we're punishing our kids
while we are <i>high?</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:21.312
We're bad parents
either way!
This is a nightmare.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.481
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, cupcake!

16:23.483 --> 16:25.149
(whispering)
do I call her "cupcake"?

16:25.151 --> 16:26.517
(whispering) don't worry,
I'll make it normal.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.519
(normal voice)
what's going on, cupcake?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.922
Are you guys okay?

16:30.924 --> 16:33.491
Yeah.
Yeah, we're okay.
Why wouldn't we be okay?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.993
Cupcake.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.528
I was so drunk,
I thought they were stoned.

16:37.530 --> 16:41.165
Luke...Luke...Luke.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.269
Keeping a secret like this
is tough --

16:45.271 --> 16:47.105
Eats away
at a man's soul.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.140
Mom,
I have one question --

16:49.142 --> 16:51.109
Why do you hate
yourself?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.777
What?

16:52.779 --> 16:55.613
You have one night in a spa
to be massaged and pampered,

16:55.615 --> 16:57.548
But you're here.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.650
Why don't you think
you deserve happiness?

16:59.652 --> 17:02.854
That's the mystery
I'm interested in solving today.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.890
(cheering in distance)
what is that?

17:05.892 --> 17:09.627
That is the sound
of a party, gloria, huh?

17:09.628 --> 17:11.396
Ay, manny!

17:12.830 --> 17:15.633
Tomorrow's gonna be one awkward
mother/son mambo class.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.502
(groans)

17:17.503 --> 17:20.304
Cameron: Oh, boom!
Jay: Next up,
I paddle your mother.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.472
(laughter)

17:21.473 --> 17:22.973
Dad.
Claire!

17:22.976 --> 17:24.742
Hey, this is
my actual daughter.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.243
You came up
a few times tonight.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.345
So has my "wife."
(laughs)

17:27.347 --> 17:28.746
What are you doing here?

17:28.748 --> 17:30.681
We ran out of games to bet on
at the bar.

17:30.683 --> 17:34.118
Claire...There's something
we have to tell you.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.555
What did we decide
to do again?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.524
We, uh...

17:39.526 --> 17:41.692
We're g--
we're gonna need a minute.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.929
I told you there was nothing
going on with the boys.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.764
(chuckles)
you're right.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.233
Boys, I apologize.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.535
We can confirm

17:50.537 --> 17:52.870
That there's
nothing suspicious anywhere.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.939
(all gasp)

17:54.941 --> 17:56.741
(groans)

17:59.445 --> 18:01.712
Sorry about
your table, lewis.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.914
I have another party.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.185
Oh, I knew it!

18:07.187 --> 18:09.087
I knew these two
were up to something.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.788
What do you think about
your precious manny now, huh?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.790
I am sure
it was <i>luke's</i> idea!

18:12.792 --> 18:14.792
But do not give up
on him yet.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.861
I know that there is a camp
up in the mountains

18:16.863 --> 18:18.196
Where you can send
bad kids.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.698
No, it was
my idea, too.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.233
I'm the one who set off
the smoke alarm.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.402
I'm the one who bribed lily
with soda.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.237
I'm the one who put a red
light bulb in the laundry room

18:26.239 --> 18:28.072
To give it a sexy vibe.

18:28.074 --> 18:31.142
You've got to stop thinking of
me as your perfect little boy.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.711
Honey.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.947
There's a party upstairs.
Party upstairs.

18:37.983 --> 18:40.885
I cannot believe
that my baby lied to me.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.287
I cannot believe
my baby accepted a bribe.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.590
I'd be more concerned
with how natural she is

18:45.592 --> 18:47.892
With that bottle
in her hands.
Okay.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.328
I shouldn't trust my kid
so much.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.431
I have to be more like claire
and not trust anybody.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.500
I didn't want to be right,
but I am.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.101
So (chuckles)
here we are.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.003
At least
we still have alex.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.505
You guys don't have
any good kids,

19:00.507 --> 19:02.440
So who's the bad parent
now, huh?

19:02.442 --> 19:03.941
Nobody.
Phil, no, don't.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.343
No, no.
I got this.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.779
Claire, I know
why you're always worried.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.682
Because you don't know
what's going to happen.

19:11.684 --> 19:17.588
It's called fear of the future,
or "fof" or "fotf."

19:17.590 --> 19:21.292
But spoiler alert --
it's gonna be great.

19:21.294 --> 19:25.696
Guys, I have two words
for you --

19:25.698 --> 19:28.166
Think about time travel.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.768
If you could go forward in time
and turn around

19:30.770 --> 19:33.337
And look at this moment,
we would say,

19:33.339 --> 19:35.706
"this is all super chill."

19:35.708 --> 19:38.109
Our kids are good people.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.944
They turn out great.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.013
Phil's right.
Really?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.148
Oh, t-then here's
something, too.

19:44.150 --> 19:47.485
When I was younger,
I never thought I would be here.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.053
And here I am.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.055
What the hell
does that mean?

19:51.057 --> 19:52.323
Oh, god.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.458
Look,
you got to relax.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.893
They're going to be fine.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.896
People have a way
of surprising you.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.199
Yes, you see, we had
our own journey tonight --

20:01.201 --> 20:03.568
An unlikely duo
thrust together.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.902
Not your moment, cam.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.470
Oh, right.
I'll send a group e-mail.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.139
Honey, don't worry.

20:08.141 --> 20:10.374
You're better parents
than dede and I ever were,

20:10.376 --> 20:11.842
And you turned out
all right.

20:11.844 --> 20:12.977
Thanks, dad.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.645
But what do we do now?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.013
Are we just supposed to
let these kids off the hook

20:16.015 --> 20:17.715
Because we were as bad
as they are?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.050
No.
We'll be hypocrites.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.351
Mm.
Like all parents!

20:20.353 --> 20:21.686
Luke! Manny!

20:21.688 --> 20:23.387
Get your asses in here!

20:23.389 --> 20:25.723
Also, am I the only one
that sees

20:25.725 --> 20:27.491
That these two idiots
are high as kites?

20:29.328 --> 20:30.561
Cameron: Mitchell?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.268
Oh, my god.
She is still going.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.203
How much soda
did she have?

20:39.205 --> 20:40.905
You know, when you and mitchell
first got together,

20:40.907 --> 20:42.940
You used to ask me
to do a lot of stuff.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.842
I was new to the family,
and I --

20:44.844 --> 20:46.510
I really wanted you
to like me.

20:46.512 --> 20:49.513
But I always seemed to be
too much, too demonstrative,

20:49.515 --> 20:52.750
Too dramatic...
So I stopped.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.385
Well, I had fun tonight.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.287
I wouldn't mind
if you still chased me

20:56.289 --> 20:57.555
A little bit sometimes.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.756
Oh, jay.
Get in here.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.591
(both laugh)
it's going too fast.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.360
I'm -- I'm sorry.
Baby steps.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.095
No, the treadmill's about to
launch her through the drywall.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.364
Lily!
Daddy!
