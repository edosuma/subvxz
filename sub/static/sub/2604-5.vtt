Previously on <i>Suits:</i>

00:01.532 --> 00:03.432
We're suing you and your
entire firm for fraud.

00:03.953 --> 00:06.520
I'm looking at a document that
implicates you in a cover-up.

00:06.522 --> 00:09.257
I savaged his reputation all
because you looked me in the eye

00:09.259 --> 00:11.492
and told me that your hood
was rock solid.

00:11.494 --> 00:13.995
You make it right
on your own or I will.

00:13.997 --> 00:16.163
When were you planning
on telling me this?

00:16.165 --> 00:17.999
Did you find what
you're not looking for?

00:18.001 --> 00:19.033
No, did u find
what you're not looking for?

00:19.035 --> 00:20.201
Nope.

00:20.203 --> 00:21.435
That document never
came into this office.

00:21.437 --> 00:22.637
Where the hell is Donna?

00:22.639 --> 00:24.038
She's in the file room.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.239
Hasn't found
that document yet.

00:25.241 --> 00:27.041
Anyone could have
seen it and missed it.

00:27.043 --> 00:28.776
I need to know
that didn't happen,

00:28.778 --> 00:32.012
or I need to know
who to fire.

Never thought I'd see

00:54.470 --> 00:56.036
the great Harvey Specter
break a sweat.

00:56.038 --> 00:57.404
You want to race,
Jeffrey?

00:57.406 --> 00:58.939
I'm more than happy
to kick your ass.

00:58.941 --> 01:00.474
Believe me, Harvey,

01:00.476 --> 01:02.209
I didn't get up
at 5:00 a.m. for my health.

01:02.211 --> 01:04.444
A guy like you
in Central Park at this hour?

01:04.447 --> 01:06.847
That's not where
my mind went either.

01:06.849 --> 01:09.483
Only guy I'm here
to solicit is you, buddy.

01:09.485 --> 01:11.518
I'll assume you've heard
of Marco Mendoza.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.753
Yeah, the 16-year-old
tennis phenom.

01:12.755 --> 01:14.321
What about him?

01:14.323 --> 01:16.256
I'm on the cusp
of signing that kid.

01:16.258 --> 01:17.491
I want you
to be part of the team.

01:17.493 --> 01:18.892
Just because
I know about tennis

01:18.894 --> 01:20.360
doesn't mean I
give a shit about tennis.

01:20.362 --> 01:21.862
Hey, the basketballs
in your office

01:21.864 --> 01:23.197
didn't autograph
themselves, Harvey.

01:23.199 --> 01:25.299
You owe me.
Oh, please.

01:25.301 --> 01:27.534
I've brought you just as
many clients as you brought me.

01:27.536 --> 01:30.237
Five minutes with the kid.
That's all I'm asking.

01:30.239 --> 01:33.507
You're an agent, Jeffrey.
It's never all you're asking.

01:33.509 --> 01:38.045
There might be
one slight wrinkle.

01:40.715 --> 01:43.083
So you want me to emancipate
him from his father?

01:43.085 --> 01:45.352
That's a hell of a thing to do
just for a commission.

01:45.354 --> 01:47.321
Just listen
to what he has to say.

01:47.323 --> 01:50.357
Marco, tell him your story.

01:50.359 --> 01:53.060
Look, I've been playing tennis
since before I could walk.

01:53.062 --> 01:55.229
When I was six, I was
crushing kids in high school.

01:55.231 --> 01:56.997
I don't play cards,
I don't drink.

01:56.999 --> 01:59.900
What I do is win.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.535
I like this kid.

02:01.537 --> 02:04.371
So what does that have
to do with your father?

02:04.373 --> 02:06.874
He won't let me go pro.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.241
So it's all
about the money.

02:08.244 --> 02:09.175
No, I don't care
about the money.

02:09.178 --> 02:10.610
You can keep the money.

02:10.613 --> 02:13.514
Nine out of ten tournaments
are closed to amateurs.

02:13.516 --> 02:16.083
If I don't go pro,
I can't play against the best.

02:16.085 --> 02:17.451
And if I can't
play against the best,

02:17.453 --> 02:18.919
I can't be the best.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.755
That's a great speech,
but you're 16,

02:21.757 --> 02:24.992
and what I'm not hearing is why
you can't wait two more years.

02:24.994 --> 02:27.261
People hit their prime
at different ages, Mr. Specter.

02:27.263 --> 02:29.463
Look at me.

02:29.465 --> 02:33.467
I have a chance to be great,
and I have a chance now.

02:51.386 --> 02:52.719
You know that paper doesn't...

02:52.721 --> 02:54.454
put itself
in the machine, right?

02:54.456 --> 02:56.056
What the hell
is wrong with you?

02:56.058 --> 02:57.291
Me? You're the one
that looks

02:57.293 --> 02:58.492
like you're
burying a dead body.

02:58.494 --> 03:00.994
It is 6:00 in the morning.

03:00.996 --> 03:02.663
I come in here
to shred in peace,

03:02.665 --> 03:04.698
and you walk in and you scare
the crap out of me.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.067
I'm sorry...
"Shred in peace"?

03:07.069 --> 03:10.070
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this machine is?

03:10.072 --> 03:11.705
Okay, I'm sorry.

03:11.707 --> 03:13.440
If you want, I can help.

03:13.442 --> 03:14.875
I'm actually here
to do some shredding myself.

03:14.877 --> 03:16.610
You know what?
Never mind.

03:16.612 --> 03:19.746
You've ruined
the whole thing.

03:19.748 --> 03:21.081
Well, the good news is,

03:21.083 --> 03:22.716
we don't have
a copy of that memo.

03:22.718 --> 03:23.951
I'm sorry
to rain on your parade,

03:23.953 --> 03:25.919
but the accusation here
isn't that you have it,

03:25.921 --> 03:27.688
it's that you buried it,

03:27.690 --> 03:28.989
so we should
probably move forward.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.290
To what?

03:30.292 --> 03:31.458
We need to put them
on the defensive.

03:31.460 --> 03:34.194
- No, we don't.
- Harvey.

03:34.196 --> 03:35.529
We need to get them
to drop the case.

03:35.531 --> 03:37.764
- And how would we do that?
- How would I do it?

03:37.766 --> 03:39.466
I would go to
the Randall family.

03:39.468 --> 03:41.001
They got screwed
and they want justice,

03:41.003 --> 03:42.469
but I'm not the guy
who screwed them,

03:42.471 --> 03:43.503
so we need to
convince them that I--

03:43.505 --> 03:45.105
Are you crazy?

03:45.107 --> 03:47.207
You trashed this woman's
dead husband in open court.

03:47.209 --> 03:48.642
Do you think
she gives a shit

03:48.644 --> 03:50.010
about whether or not
you buried that document?

03:50.012 --> 03:52.245
If you go there, you're not
just poking the bear,

03:52.247 --> 03:54.181
you're putting
a cattle prod up its ass.

03:54.183 --> 03:55.682
Is that
the same crack advice

03:55.684 --> 03:57.985
you gave Brockton Cosmetics
and Drake Consulting

03:57.987 --> 03:59.286
and Nappi LLC.?

03:59.288 --> 04:00.887
'Cause none of those companies
exist anymore.

04:00.889 --> 04:02.556
Congratulations, Harvey.

04:02.558 --> 04:05.092
You found the three cases
that I've lost in 14 years.

04:05.094 --> 04:07.027
And do you know what else
those cases have in common?

04:07.029 --> 04:10.430
Nothing. Because I learn
from my mistakes.

04:10.432 --> 04:11.798
Well, I'd prefer
to be represented by someone

04:11.800 --> 04:13.467
who doesn't make any mistakes
in the first place.

04:13.469 --> 04:15.202
Like you?

04:15.204 --> 04:16.937
Because you've been accused
of burying evidence

04:16.939 --> 04:18.605
not once, but twice.

04:18.607 --> 04:20.507
Those accusations
are bullshit.

04:20.509 --> 04:22.041
And that is
what I'm here to prove.

04:22.043 --> 04:25.579
Jessica, if I may?

04:25.581 --> 04:28.215
I don't think Harvey's problem
is with Allison.

04:28.217 --> 04:30.817
I think his problem
is with me.

04:30.819 --> 04:32.753
Daniel, we don't need
to air our laundry in here.

04:32.755 --> 04:35.155
This is
a privileged conversation.

04:35.157 --> 04:38.158
Jessica, I'm asking
you and Harvey to trust me.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.894
So I'm going to
do the same for you.

04:40.896 --> 04:45.165
I brought Allison in here
because I think she's the best.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.034
Use her or don't.

04:47.036 --> 04:51.104
But, if not, I suggest
you find someone just as good.

04:51.106 --> 04:53.507
Harvey...

04:53.509 --> 04:58.045
will you give
Allison and me a minute?

04:58.047 --> 05:01.081
Let her down easy.

05:03.284 --> 05:06.753
Allison,
I am impressed by you.

05:06.755 --> 05:08.021
But if I'm going
to give you this job,

05:08.023 --> 05:10.023
I need to know
that I can trust you.

05:10.025 --> 05:11.725
I'm a straight shooter,
Jessica.

05:11.727 --> 05:14.728
Easy to say,
harder to prove.

05:14.730 --> 05:16.296
All right,
how about this?

05:16.298 --> 05:19.232
Um, you are
an elegant woman,

05:19.234 --> 05:20.767
but there's no
getting around it...

05:20.769 --> 05:24.838
that dress does not
belong in this office.

05:27.443 --> 05:28.709
I like you.

05:28.711 --> 05:30.711
This may be something
that you don't like.

05:30.713 --> 05:33.647
You won't be the one
dictating terms here. I will.

05:33.649 --> 05:35.148
And regarding your laundry,

05:35.150 --> 05:36.917
you have my word that Danny
won't be involved,

05:36.919 --> 05:39.519
but you need to keep
that man on a leash.

05:39.521 --> 05:40.921
- She said that to your face?
- Yep.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.856
- You kick her ass out?
- Hired her on the spot.

05:42.858 --> 05:43.957
The woman insults you,

05:43.959 --> 05:45.926
all of a sudden
you're in bed with her?

05:45.928 --> 05:47.661
Maybe I should tell you
how much I hate those shoes.

05:47.663 --> 05:48.762
That's the joke
you're gonna make?

05:48.764 --> 05:50.163
What?
It's both respectful

05:50.165 --> 05:51.965
and disrespectful
at the same time.

05:51.967 --> 05:53.734
Harvey, I don't
want you to overlook

05:53.736 --> 05:56.470
the point of the story.
It's Allison's case.

05:56.472 --> 05:57.771
The firm is the client,
and you're--

05:57.773 --> 06:02.209
- The dog on a leash?
- Stay out of her way.

06:07.148 --> 06:08.415
I got the address.

06:08.417 --> 06:09.716
Then I guess it's time

06:09.718 --> 06:12.652
for this dog
to go chase some cars.

06:54.496 --> 06:55.752
That's good.

06:56.763 --> 06:58.964
I am not seeing
what I'm seeing.

06:58.966 --> 07:00.532
Mrs. Randall, please,

07:00.534 --> 07:02.601
I know you hate me for
what I did to your husband.

07:02.603 --> 07:03.869
"Hate" is not the word.

07:03.871 --> 07:06.305
There is no word to describe
what I feel for you.

07:06.307 --> 07:08.941
Now get your ass--
Jennifer, look where we are.

07:08.943 --> 07:10.742
I don't mean
to disrespect you

07:10.744 --> 07:12.544
or dishonor
your husband's memory.

07:12.546 --> 07:14.012
You've already done that.

07:14.014 --> 07:15.447
I'm trying to make up
for it now.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.182
Now that your back's
against the wall.

07:17.184 --> 07:19.685
No, I started years ago.

07:22.555 --> 07:24.856
This says
he's our anonymous donor.

07:24.858 --> 07:26.625
- It's true.
- Of course. Guilty conscience.

07:26.627 --> 07:29.061
No, I don't have
a guilty conscience,

07:29.063 --> 07:30.896
'cause I wasn't the one
who hid that memo.

07:30.898 --> 07:32.264
Look, I went
after your husband

07:32.266 --> 07:33.999
because I thought
that car was solid.

07:34.001 --> 07:36.335
I didn't like doing it,
but it was my job.

07:36.337 --> 07:37.903
Why'd you give us
the money then?

07:37.905 --> 07:39.638
Because you were trying
to make something good

07:39.640 --> 07:41.974
come from something bad,
like I am now.

07:41.976 --> 07:44.176
- What do you want?
- I know what he wants.

07:44.178 --> 07:46.612
We're not
dropping our suit.

07:46.614 --> 07:48.547
And the fact that you would
come here to tell me that

07:48.549 --> 07:51.216
shows me just what kind
of self-serving trash you are.

07:51.218 --> 07:54.019
You're right, I came here
to get you to drop your suit.

07:54.021 --> 07:57.322
But instead of self-serving,
let's talk about me serving you.

07:57.324 --> 07:59.391
You want payback
for what was done to you--

07:59.393 --> 08:01.360
justice--
and I can get it.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.328
My husband died,

08:03.330 --> 08:05.697
and you made me sit there
while you shit on him.

08:05.699 --> 08:07.499
That's what was done to me.

08:07.501 --> 08:10.569
Now you're gonna tell me
that wasn't you?

08:10.571 --> 08:12.404
Yeah, I want justice,

08:12.406 --> 08:16.008
but that little donation
doesn't cover it.

08:34.428 --> 08:36.495
This isn't really helping
your street cred, Harold.

08:36.496 --> 08:38.330
It's not mine,
it's Louis'.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.164
What's his name?

08:40.167 --> 08:42.366
Bruno.
He brought him in

08:42.369 --> 08:43.669
because he hasn't
been eating.

08:43.671 --> 08:46.171
Whoa, wh--have you
mentioned to Louis

08:46.173 --> 08:48.173
that you're allergic?

08:48.175 --> 08:50.242
I tried to,
but he said that--

08:50.244 --> 08:52.110
Allergies
are a sign of weakness.

08:52.112 --> 08:54.646
Right, and bringing your cat
to work is a sign of strength.

08:54.648 --> 08:57.683
Yeah, you want
to trade places?

08:57.685 --> 08:59.751
Uh, nope.

08:59.753 --> 09:01.286
No, I got a meeting
in the conference room.

09:01.288 --> 09:02.587
That's right,
that little tennis fling.

09:02.589 --> 09:03.855
Makes me sick.

09:03.857 --> 09:05.724
Harvey's got no appreciation
for the game.

09:05.726 --> 09:07.526
Man wouldn't know topspin
if it hit him in the ball sack.

09:07.528 --> 09:10.629
But enjoy yourself.
Get out.

09:15.768 --> 09:18.070
Can you not smell that?
I'm stuffed up.

09:18.072 --> 09:19.237
Uhhuh.
How long has it been?

09:19.239 --> 09:20.238
Two hours.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.406
How often do
I tell you to do it?

09:21.408 --> 09:24.976
I'll get the bag.

09:24.978 --> 09:25.977
Hi.

09:25.979 --> 09:28.113
What's wrong, Bruno?

09:28.115 --> 09:29.281
You're my best friend.

09:29.283 --> 09:32.551
- You all set?
- I'm ready to roll.

09:32.553 --> 09:34.019
Good, 'cause I got
a bidding war starting

09:34.021 --> 09:36.555
for Marco's endorsement.

09:36.557 --> 09:37.856
Dad?

09:37.858 --> 09:39.257
Marco, why don't
you take a seat?

09:39.259 --> 09:40.359
What's he doing here?

09:40.361 --> 09:41.793
He's here to meet
with his son.

09:41.795 --> 09:44.162
We're emancipating,
and you said you were in.

09:44.164 --> 09:46.231
I did, which means
Marco's my client,

09:46.233 --> 09:49.134
not you, so why don't you
go home, Jeffrey?

09:49.136 --> 09:51.303
I'll call you
when we're done.

09:55.475 --> 09:58.110
Mr. Mendoza,
I want to be clear,

09:58.112 --> 09:59.311
I'm not here
to exploit your son.

09:59.313 --> 10:00.512
I'm here to protect him.

10:00.514 --> 10:01.513
You're off
to a good start.

10:01.515 --> 10:03.115
You can ask
any one of my clients.

10:03.117 --> 10:04.149
They'll tell you the same.

10:04.151 --> 10:06.818
You represent
Michael Jordan.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.421
I do. In fact, I want
to tell you a story about him.

10:09.423 --> 10:11.857
You want to tell me
a story about Michael Jordan

10:11.859 --> 10:13.358
to convince me
my son should turn pro?

10:13.360 --> 10:15.327
Let me tell you a story
about George Washington.

10:15.329 --> 10:16.828
Maybe junior here
could become President.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.097
I'm really more of
an Abe Lincoln fan myself.

10:19.099 --> 10:20.766
You know, freed the slaves,
great beard.

10:20.768 --> 10:22.401
- You finished?
- Yep.

10:22.403 --> 10:26.405
Everybody knows M.J.
took two years off in his prime.

10:26.407 --> 10:28.206
He regrets it to this day.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.374
But he made
that decision himself,

10:29.376 --> 10:31.109
and that's how
he lives with it.

10:31.111 --> 10:34.679
All your son is asking is
for the chance to do the same.

10:34.681 --> 10:35.781
I may not know
Mr. Jordan,

10:35.783 --> 10:37.549
but I do know
that he's divorced,

10:37.551 --> 10:40.218
and I've heard the rumors
about his gambling problem.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.887
He's a man apart.

10:41.889 --> 10:45.290
Now, my son is not ready
to handle that kind of life.

10:45.292 --> 10:47.626
You've prepared me for this
since I was three.

10:47.628 --> 10:49.928
I taught you tennis
because it's a beautiful game.

10:49.930 --> 10:52.197
You may not have set out
to raise a prodigy,

10:52.199 --> 10:53.598
but the fact is,
you did.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.034
Do you have any children,
Mr. Specter?

10:56.036 --> 10:59.004
No? Then I'm not interested
in your parenting advice.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.439
I'm not giving
parenting advice.

11:00.441 --> 11:01.740
I'm giving career advice.

11:01.742 --> 11:03.942
You told me that
you didn't want to exploit him,

11:03.944 --> 11:05.644
that you wanted
to protect him--

11:05.646 --> 11:08.079
him, not his career.
- Look, you don't get it.

11:08.081 --> 11:09.481
They're the same to me.

11:09.483 --> 11:10.582
All right, I'm committed
to both of them,

11:10.584 --> 11:11.383
and I don't give a shit
if you like it or not.

11:11.385 --> 11:12.951
Marco.

11:12.953 --> 11:14.152
You say that word to me
in front of these parasites?

11:14.154 --> 11:15.587
Yeah, I'll say
whatever I want to say.

11:15.589 --> 11:17.489
Shut your mouth.

11:17.491 --> 11:19.224
Now, you are not
going to turn pro,

11:19.226 --> 11:21.460
and you are not going
to continue down this path,

11:21.462 --> 11:25.897
and this conversation
is over.

11:25.899 --> 11:27.466
You just want
to let him leave?

11:27.468 --> 11:29.034
Look, I don't
care what he does, okay?

11:29.036 --> 11:32.037
I want to file
for emancipation.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.841
So you're telling me
you don't have it?

11:35.843 --> 11:37.642
I don't, but I'm sure
it'll turn up.

11:37.644 --> 11:38.944
You sure?

11:38.946 --> 11:40.579
Your job was to keep track
of that one thing.

11:40.581 --> 11:41.746
Nice work.

11:41.748 --> 11:43.482
It's a birthday card
for Norma.

11:43.484 --> 11:44.616
She won't even tell us
how old she is.

11:44.618 --> 11:45.984
Her birthday is today.

11:45.986 --> 11:48.487
When do you think
it's going to turn up?

11:48.489 --> 11:49.488
You know what,
forget it.

11:49.490 --> 11:51.356
What's the matter with you?

11:51.358 --> 11:53.358
What's the matter with me
is that nobody ever has

11:53.360 --> 11:55.560
what they're supposed to
in this goddamn office.

11:59.131 --> 12:01.533
You know what?
I got bigger fish to fry.

12:01.535 --> 12:03.335
Put the wheels in motion.
"The wheels"?

12:03.337 --> 12:04.469
This isn't a merger,
Harvey.

12:04.471 --> 12:06.104
You're talking
about emancipation.

12:06.106 --> 12:08.340
I'm talking about
filing for emancipation.

12:08.342 --> 12:11.009
It's a tactic.
He cares about his son.

12:11.011 --> 12:12.210
Nine times out of ten,
he backs down.

12:12.212 --> 12:13.712
And what if he doesn't?

12:13.714 --> 12:16.281
Then we'll be doing exactly
what the client wants us to do.

12:16.283 --> 12:17.649
Oh, you mean
break up his family.

12:17.651 --> 12:18.984
I mean help his family.

12:18.986 --> 12:20.285
Wow, wonder
what kind of relationship

12:20.287 --> 12:21.586
you had with your father.

12:21.588 --> 12:23.255
Look, my father's
not up for discussion.

12:23.257 --> 12:26.024
The only bone of contention
between them is this decision.

12:26.026 --> 12:28.093
The sooner they resolve it,
the sooner they can move on.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.294
The sooner you get paid.

12:29.296 --> 12:30.996
I cut billion dollar deals
for breakfast.

12:30.998 --> 12:33.398
I don't need this.
I told you,

12:33.400 --> 12:35.734
it's what the client wants.

12:35.736 --> 12:37.369
It's what
he <i>thinks</i> he wants.

12:37.371 --> 12:40.372
Harvey, I was 11
when my dad died,

12:40.374 --> 12:42.841
and our last conversation
was a fight.

12:42.843 --> 12:44.910
If you gave me the choice
to be a pro anything

12:44.912 --> 12:47.512
or to make up with him,
what do you think I'd choose?

12:47.514 --> 12:49.848
If we don't do it, he'll find
someone else who will.

12:49.850 --> 12:53.318
If you don't want him to do it,
change his goddamn mind.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.655
Now go.
Fine.

13:05.031 --> 13:06.431
Here's your
goddamn birthday card.

13:06.433 --> 13:08.967
I don't appreciate you
coming into my office saying

13:08.969 --> 13:11.436
that no one at the firm has
what they're supposed to have,

13:11.438 --> 13:12.804
and I don't know what
crawled up your ass today,

13:12.806 --> 13:14.372
but I take care of
my business.

13:14.374 --> 13:18.076
I'm sorry, Rach.
You're right.

13:18.078 --> 13:20.211
This isn't about you.
This is about me.

13:20.213 --> 13:22.647
Okay then.

13:46.839 --> 13:50.542
I unplugged it.

13:52.211 --> 13:54.813
And this time, I'm not
stopping you by accident.

13:54.815 --> 13:56.314
I have no idea
what you're talking about--

13:56.316 --> 13:58.083
Don't bullshit me, Donna.

13:58.085 --> 14:00.852
That's the same file you had
in your hand this morning.

14:00.854 --> 14:04.055
You ran out of here
like you saw a ghost,

14:04.057 --> 14:06.458
you bit off Rachel's head,
talking about how people

14:06.460 --> 14:07.659
never have the things
they're supposed to have,

14:07.661 --> 14:10.395
and now you're
right back here again.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.597
It's not Dalton Enterprises
you're holding.

14:12.599 --> 14:14.799
That's the memo that Harvey's
been accused of burying.

14:14.801 --> 14:17.569
You know, the fact that
you would even accuse me of that

14:17.571 --> 14:20.205
makes me sick.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.539
But if you still
don't believe me, fine.

14:21.541 --> 14:24.309
See for yourself.

14:28.981 --> 14:30.515
I don't know what to do.

14:30.517 --> 14:32.484
Tell me what happened.

14:32.486 --> 14:33.852
I found it in
the file room that day.

14:33.854 --> 14:35.787
It has my date stamp
on it--mine.

14:35.789 --> 14:37.489
We have
to tell Harvey.

14:37.491 --> 14:39.190
He'll know what to do.
No, he won't.

14:39.192 --> 14:40.525
Donna, Harvey's been
operating under the assumption

14:40.527 --> 14:41.860
that we never had
this memo, all right?

14:41.862 --> 14:43.228
At some point,
that assumption

14:43.230 --> 14:44.596
is gonna bite him
in the ass,

14:44.598 --> 14:45.997
and the later it happens,
the bigger the bite.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.132
Nobody
is going to believe

14:47.134 --> 14:48.767
that a file that important
just got lost.

14:48.769 --> 14:50.435
They'll think that
I got rid of it,

14:50.437 --> 14:51.803
and that Harvey
told me to do it.

14:51.805 --> 14:53.605
This memo is part
of a legal proceeding.

14:53.607 --> 14:55.340
Shredding it is a crime.

14:55.342 --> 14:58.209
Like practicing law
without a license is a crime?

15:00.146 --> 15:02.380
Unlike you,
I didn't do this on purpose,

15:02.382 --> 15:04.949
and I am protecting Harvey
the best way that I know how.

15:04.951 --> 15:06.685
Allison Holt is gonna
figure out what happened.

15:06.687 --> 15:08.253
And when she does,
her priority's not going to be

15:08.255 --> 15:09.821
protecting you or Harvey.

15:09.823 --> 15:13.024
It's gonna be
protecting the firm.

15:13.026 --> 15:14.859
You might be comfortable
putting Harvey in that position,

15:14.861 --> 15:16.728
but I'm not.

15:16.730 --> 15:19.831
So either you tell him,
or I will.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.084
- The answer is yes.
- What?

15:52.086 --> 15:55.387
You can have
Halloween off this year.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.323
Every July, you sit there
staring at me

15:58.325 --> 16:01.159
before coming in here with
that sheepish look on your face

16:01.161 --> 16:02.728
to ask to--
I have to tell you something.

16:02.730 --> 16:03.795
What?
What is it?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.931
What the hell
were you thinking?

16:05.933 --> 16:07.432
You contacted
the plaintiffs

16:07.434 --> 16:09.134
without their lawyer present
or our lawyer present.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.236
Exactly,
I'm not our lawyer.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.537
I had every legal right to.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.239
You weren't supposed
to interfere.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.042
Neither were you.
How did you even know?

16:17.044 --> 16:18.343
She's not supposed
to tell you anything.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.379
She was
forced to tell me

16:20.381 --> 16:22.347
when I got served
with this goddamn subpoena.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.749
You didn't want
to put them on the defensive,

16:23.751 --> 16:25.484
which is good,
because what you've just done

16:25.486 --> 16:26.718
is put us
on the defensive,

16:26.720 --> 16:28.120
so now I have to spend
the next two weeks

16:28.122 --> 16:30.722
prepping everyone from
Jessica to your secretary,

16:30.724 --> 16:33.325
because Travis Tanner is gonna
depose them under oath.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.327
Nobody here knows
a thing about that goddamn memo.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.661
Let them waste
their time with it.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.398
This is why you hire
outside counsel.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.665
You can't see
how reckless that was,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.567
even now, after
it's blown up in your face.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.704
Fine, if you insist on
pre-deposing their depositions,

16:45.706 --> 16:47.973
let's get it over with.
You can start with me.

16:47.975 --> 16:50.442
I already have
your version of events.

16:50.444 --> 16:53.311
Okay, you can
start with Donna.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.982
What's not to understand?

16:56.984 --> 16:59.017
Most fathers in the same
situation would either

16:59.019 --> 17:01.319
want to live vicariously
through their children's lives

17:01.321 --> 17:02.654
or sponge off their backs,

17:02.656 --> 17:04.856
but your father,
he's just trying to protect you.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.525
Yeah, look, I know
what he thinks he's doing.

17:06.527 --> 17:09.327
Marco, it's a year
and eight months.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.163
Maybe, but you don't
know what it's like

17:11.165 --> 17:12.897
to be better at something
than everyone.

17:12.900 --> 17:16.667
A year and eight months
is 505 days.

17:16.670 --> 17:21.540
12,120 hours
and 727,200 minutes.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.407
Yeah, I know what it's like.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.577
You can do math
when you're an old man.

17:25.579 --> 17:27.112
I can only dominate
till I'm 30.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.880
Maybe, but if you go through
with this now,

17:28.882 --> 17:30.582
you're gonna drive a wedge
between the two of you

17:30.584 --> 17:32.084
that'll last
the rest of your life.

17:32.086 --> 17:33.585
It's already there
because of him.

17:33.587 --> 17:35.153
I'm like the horse
in the stall.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.089
He won't open the gate, and
if it stays shut much longer,

17:37.091 --> 17:40.292
I'm gonna go crazy.
All right, you're the client.

17:40.294 --> 17:41.560
I just have a couple
of questions for you

17:41.562 --> 17:43.028
before we can file
with the courts, okay?

17:43.030 --> 17:44.463
Okay, great.

17:44.465 --> 17:45.764
Has your father ever
abused drugs or alcohol?

17:45.766 --> 17:47.499
- No.
- Is he a gambling addict?

17:47.501 --> 17:48.867
- No, nothing like that.
- Is your home without

17:48.869 --> 17:50.936
electricity,
running water, food?

17:50.938 --> 17:52.003
We don't live in a slum.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.271
Emancipation
requires proof

17:53.273 --> 17:55.240
that your father
is an unfit parent.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.442
We have to think about
how this plays in court.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.044
And telling a judge
that he just wants you

17:59.046 --> 18:01.113
to wait until you finish
high school before you make

18:01.115 --> 18:04.916
millions of dollars
is not going to cut it.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.086
Look, Marco...

18:08.088 --> 18:09.287
what I saw in
that conference room

18:09.289 --> 18:13.024
is not a father
who was unfit.

18:13.026 --> 18:15.393
I saw a father
who loves his son.

18:19.365 --> 18:22.300
You saw something else
in there, too.

18:22.302 --> 18:26.872
You saw how furious he gets
when he's defied.

18:26.874 --> 18:29.207
What are you getting at?

18:29.209 --> 18:31.276
I'm getting at what happens
when he feels that way

18:31.278 --> 18:35.680
and nobody else
is around.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.884
There's no reason
to be concerned.

18:38.886 --> 18:40.819
These are pro forma questions
I'm asking everyone.

18:40.821 --> 18:42.220
Oh, I'm not concerned,
I'm bored,

18:42.222 --> 18:43.788
so can we just...

18:43.790 --> 18:45.457
Of course.

18:45.459 --> 18:47.726
Do you think you can move
that other there?

18:47.728 --> 18:49.127
It's my good side.

18:49.129 --> 18:52.197
Well, my better side.
They're both good.

18:52.199 --> 18:55.433
I'm just going to start.
Um...

18:55.435 --> 18:57.969
So, when documents
are received into the firm,

18:57.971 --> 18:59.070
they then come to you.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.539
Is that correct?
Yes.

19:00.541 --> 19:02.707
And how do they get
from the mail room to you?

19:02.709 --> 19:05.977
Transporter beam.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.782
Ms. Paulsen, I understand
that your time is valuable,

19:10.784 --> 19:12.851
but I'm here
to prepare you.

19:12.853 --> 19:16.454
And to a jury,
sarcasm plays as obstructive.

19:16.456 --> 19:21.126
Obviously, any further mention
of <i>Star Trek</i>

19:21.128 --> 19:23.628
may just compound
the problem, okay?

19:23.630 --> 19:26.765
Aye, cap'n.

19:26.767 --> 19:29.034
It's Donna, right?

19:29.036 --> 19:31.503
All right,
so where you from, Donna?

19:31.505 --> 19:34.039
- Upstate.
- Like Utica?

19:34.041 --> 19:36.007
No, Cortland, actually.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.109
Cortland's kind of
in the middle, isn't it?

19:38.111 --> 19:39.544
I'm sorry, what does this
have to do with...

19:39.546 --> 19:40.812
I'm just trying
to get to know you,

19:40.814 --> 19:42.047
break down the walls.

19:42.049 --> 19:43.381
You may not
know this about me,

19:43.383 --> 19:45.116
but the truth is,
I'm actually single.

19:45.118 --> 19:48.320
- Divorced?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

19:48.322 --> 19:51.122
But anyway, I've been
going on all these dates,

19:51.124 --> 19:53.091
and I found that
sometimes the best way

19:53.093 --> 19:54.392
to get
the conversation going

19:54.394 --> 19:56.027
is just start asking
a bunch of questions.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.730
For example, where do you
see yourself in five years?

19:58.732 --> 20:00.899
Well, actually, that's--

20:00.901 --> 20:03.235
'Cause where I see you
is in jail.

20:03.237 --> 20:04.903
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

20:04.905 --> 20:06.504
You know what Harvey did
with that memo,

20:06.506 --> 20:07.806
and you're going
to tell me right now.

20:07.808 --> 20:11.409
Harvey didn't do anything.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.979
Oh, I see.

20:13.981 --> 20:17.782
He didn't have to
because you did it for him.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.051
That's not true.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.820
Then tell me
what is true.

20:21.822 --> 20:24.656
Well, that's easy.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.825
You don't give a shit
about me or Harvey.

20:26.827 --> 20:28.660
This is a witch hunt,

20:28.662 --> 20:32.430
and I'm not gonna sit in
this room for another minute.

20:35.007 --> 20:36.107
I've worked
with Harvey since

20:36.109 --> 20:37.768
he was a rookie
in the mail room.

20:37.813 --> 20:39.212
No way he buried that memo.

20:39.214 --> 20:41.214
You didn't see Donna
in that room.

20:41.216 --> 20:43.783
I'm not saying
she wouldn't do it if he asked.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.318
I'm saying
he wouldn't ask.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.853
Wouldn't he?

20:46.855 --> 20:48.621
Because she's not
the only person I talked to.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.648
Now, a lot of people,
they don't like Harvey.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.349
But even the ones
that love him

20:52.351 --> 20:56.053
say he likes to work
in the gray.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.655
I'd like Harvey
to sign this affidavit

20:57.657 --> 20:59.356
swearing that his office
never received the memo.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.357
Why?

21:00.359 --> 21:01.892
To put with
this motion to dismiss.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.728
If you wanted to file
a motion to dismiss,

21:04.730 --> 21:06.563
you would have
done that already.

21:06.565 --> 21:10.000
You want me to sign that thing
to cover your ass.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.735
Do I think it's likely

21:11.737 --> 21:13.337
that this case
is gonna get dismissed?

21:13.339 --> 21:17.241
No, but it's worth a shot,
and to your point,

21:17.243 --> 21:19.209
I'm not just doing this
to cover my ass.

21:19.211 --> 21:22.713
I'm doing it
to cover your ass.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.783
File the motion.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.818
Harvey will sign
whatever I put in front of him.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.059
I give you
one simple task.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.660
Bruno isn't eating,
so you give him milk.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.396
- I did.
- This is half-and-half.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.465
I thought he'd like it.
It's creamier.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.833
Hey, you know what,
maybe next time

21:42.835 --> 21:45.669
I'll just hand my cat over
to Michael Vick.

21:54.045 --> 21:56.246
Is that a cat carrier
in your hand?

21:56.248 --> 21:57.481
No.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.616
Is there a cat
in that thing?

21:59.618 --> 22:00.918
It's called
a feline transportation unit.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.386
Cat carrier.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.387
Okay, they wouldn't call it
a cat carrier

22:03.389 --> 22:04.722
when it costs $400.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.557
- Do they call it a rip-off?
- Okay, you know what,

22:06.559 --> 22:08.592
I don't have time for this.
Besides, I'm late as it is.

22:08.594 --> 22:11.228
I have to ask.
What appointment?

22:11.230 --> 22:12.863
- Dentist.
- With a cat?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.631
- For the cat.
- You take him to a cat dentist?

22:14.633 --> 22:15.966
I can't take him
to my dentist.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.701
Dr. Schneller wouldn't know
what to do with him.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.236
- Dr. Richard Schneller?
- Good-bye, Harvey.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.738
I don't want to hear it.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.972
If it's bad news,
I don't want to hear it.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.440
- You seem upset.
- Of course I'm upset.

22:23.442 --> 22:24.508
I just found out
that Louis and I

22:24.510 --> 22:25.776
share the same dentist.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.877
Have you spoken
to Donna yet?

22:26.879 --> 22:27.945
No,
and I'm pissed about it.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.279
I need her to get me
a new dentist.

22:29.281 --> 22:30.647
Well, we have a problem,

22:30.649 --> 22:31.482
whether you want
to hear it or not.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.850
What?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.384
Marco needs to be emancipated
from his father.

22:34.386 --> 22:35.619
But that's not a problem.
That's what we're doing.

22:35.621 --> 22:36.620
No, I don't mean
to let him play.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.856
I mean to keep him safe.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.824
That is directly
from the hospital.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.726
His dad did that to him.

22:42.728 --> 22:44.361
We need to get him away
from his father.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.696
I need to get him away.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.664
I set the hearing,
and I'm going to win.

22:47.666 --> 22:48.932
I'm hearing
a lot of "I"s in there.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.334
- Harvey--
- This isn't housing court.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.702
This is a kid's life.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.237
I know that,
and the only reason

22:53.239 --> 22:54.505
you know that
is because I gave a shit

22:54.507 --> 22:56.039
about this kid's life
in the first place.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.142
You think I didn't think
I was smarter

22:58.144 --> 22:59.943
than the guy
I started working for?

22:59.945 --> 23:03.347
I did, and I was,
and I waited my goddamn turn.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.149
Harvey, I'm ready.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.316
It's time to let me
out of the gate.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.252
Allison's filing
a motion to dismiss.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.888
She's swinging for the fences,
I'll give her that.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.056
You know what, I'm gonna
swing for the fences too.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.424
Mike's going to court.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.627
- I am?
- What's the case?

23:16.629 --> 23:18.162
Emancipation.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.164
- From him?
- I wish.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.431
He doesn't need
a court order for that.

23:21.433 --> 23:23.100
- Our little baby's growing up.
- Okay.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.935
Listen, I need you
to sign this affidavit

23:24.937 --> 23:27.104
that we never received
that memo from Coastal Motors.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.763
Oh, my God!
Oh, I'm--

23:52.765 --> 23:55.199
There are napkins
over there.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.768
I knew he wasn't a lawyer.
I didn't think he was an idiot.

23:57.770 --> 23:58.769
I knew he was an idiot.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.037
I didn't know
he was spastic.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.705
I'm sorry, guys.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.073
When you get this cleaned up,
come see me.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.342
I'll get you a fresh one.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.411
- What the hell was that?
- What?

24:07.413 --> 24:09.046
- You know what.
- It was an accident.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.080
It was intentional.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.582
You ambushed me
with a cup of coffee.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.351
Think I haven't seen <i>Ronin?</i>

24:14.353 --> 24:15.485
It was all
I could think of.

24:15.487 --> 24:16.553
Meaning?

24:16.555 --> 24:18.689
Donna was supposed
to tell you.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.023
Tell me what?

24:20.025 --> 24:21.391
You can't
sign the affidavit.

24:21.393 --> 24:25.629
You'll be
committing perjury.

24:33.838 --> 24:36.006
What the hell
were you thinking?

24:36.008 --> 24:37.507
I didn't know
how to tell you.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.643
"Harvey, I found the memo."
Is that so goddamn hard?

24:39.645 --> 24:42.646
You don't understand.
It had my name on it.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.082
I stamped it in.
That implicates you.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.583
Did you keep it
from me four years ago?

24:46.585 --> 24:48.919
I don't even remember
seeing it four years ago.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.420
Then I don't give a shit
what it implicates.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.922
You don't keep it
from me now.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.757
I had never made
a mistake like that,

24:53.759 --> 24:55.225
and I thought
that I needed to--

24:55.227 --> 24:56.860
Look, keeping it from me
isn't a mistake.

24:56.862 --> 24:59.796
It's a decision.
I wanted to protect you.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.765
Lying to me
doesn't protect me.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.867
It betrays me.
Betrays you?

25:03.869 --> 25:05.602
If I had told you
the truth--

25:05.604 --> 25:07.504
You don't
keep things from me!

25:07.506 --> 25:08.538
You keep things from me
all the time!

25:08.540 --> 25:10.007
That's because
I'm your boss.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.175
Well, maybe you shouldn't
be my boss anymore.

25:14.946 --> 25:16.680
I did what I thought
I had to do for you,

25:16.682 --> 25:19.883
and if you can't...

25:19.885 --> 25:21.518
just fire me.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.686
Let me explain
something to you.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.788
That memo doesn't hurt me.
It helps me.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.124
If I had buried it,
we wouldn't have it.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.627
But you found it,
so that's a good thing.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.396
What?

25:32.398 --> 25:35.232
Wh-what'd you do?

25:35.234 --> 25:37.067
Oh, what did you do?

25:37.069 --> 25:39.236
Allison
had that freaking camera,

25:39.238 --> 25:41.705
and I was--

25:41.707 --> 25:43.840
she implied that we were--

25:43.842 --> 25:46.343
What did you do?

25:46.345 --> 25:48.345
It's gone.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.615
You destroyed it?

25:53.151 --> 25:54.685
I'm not going
to fire you, Donna.

25:54.687 --> 25:58.722
I might kill you,
but I'm not gonna fire you.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.157
What are you going to do?

26:00.159 --> 26:02.926
What you should've done
from day one.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.901
Let me get this straight.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.536
Your own assistant
destroys evidence,

26:12.538 --> 26:13.570
and you still want
to go to trial?

26:13.572 --> 26:14.938
- Yes.
- No.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.673
You need to cut a deal
right now.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.775
You mean we need
to cut a deal, right,

26:18.777 --> 26:20.210
because we're
all on the same side?

26:20.212 --> 26:21.745
Harvey.

26:21.747 --> 26:22.713
You think I didn't know
what you were up to

26:22.715 --> 26:24.381
with that affidavit?

26:24.383 --> 26:25.849
I was advising my client,
the firm.

26:25.851 --> 26:28.719
You once told me
I was the firm.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.455
She came to me and thought
that you were in on it.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.323
I said no way.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.459
She wanted you
to sign that thing.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.761
I'm the leader of this firm.
I made a decision.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.731
You were happy to do it.
Don't blame me for Donna.

26:40.733 --> 26:44.301
I'm not, but I need to know
if you still believe me.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.303
- I do.
- That's beside the point.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.472
We have a decision to make.
There is no decision.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.640
We need
to cut a deal--today.

26:50.642 --> 26:51.608
You know what,
that's the difference

26:51.610 --> 26:52.809
between us, Allison.

26:52.811 --> 26:54.845
You want to lose small.
I want to win big.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.314
She's the one
who has to try the case.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.448
Regardless of
what Donna did,

26:58.450 --> 26:59.649
I never saw the memo.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.151
Are you gonna
sell a jury on that?

27:01.153 --> 27:03.820
Maybe the same way you sold it
to the Randall family.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.656
We have a window to settle this
before we have to disclose,

27:06.658 --> 27:08.058
but it's closing,
and when it does,

27:08.060 --> 27:09.626
we could offer them
the moon.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.827
They're not gonna take it.
What's the downside of asking?

27:10.829 --> 27:12.462
We went through this
with the nurses.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.199
It tells them we're weak.
We are weak.

27:16.201 --> 27:19.036
Set it up.

27:19.038 --> 27:22.672
And whatever you're thinking,
I don't want to hear it.

27:56.460 --> 27:59.629
Mr. Mendoza, you've
asserted that, as a parent,

27:59.631 --> 28:01.631
you have certain rights.

28:01.633 --> 28:03.066
Do those include
the right to discipline Marco

28:03.068 --> 28:04.834
as you see fit?

28:04.836 --> 28:06.436
Every parent
has that right.

28:06.438 --> 28:09.105
The right to teach
your child a lesson.

28:09.107 --> 28:10.673
- Yes.
- When he defies you.

28:10.675 --> 28:13.209
If need be.

28:13.211 --> 28:15.812
And if need be,
do you get angry?

28:15.814 --> 28:18.114
Do you fly off the handle?
Do you become abusive?

28:18.116 --> 28:19.716
No, I would
never go that far.

28:19.718 --> 28:21.050
Mr. Mendoza,
would you agree that,

28:21.052 --> 28:22.619
along with those rights,

28:22.621 --> 28:25.088
you have certain
responsibilities as a parent?

28:25.090 --> 28:26.956
Of course.

28:26.958 --> 28:28.424
The responsibility
to keep your son healthy?

28:28.426 --> 28:30.927
Marco gets up every day
at 4:30 to train.

28:30.929 --> 28:32.428
I think that one's covered.

28:32.430 --> 28:34.497
The responsibility
to keep your son safe?

28:34.499 --> 28:36.366
That's the first job
of every parent.

28:36.368 --> 28:38.134
Hmm.

28:38.136 --> 28:40.603
Let's talk about
May 18th of last year.

28:40.605 --> 28:41.838
You took your son
to the hospital

28:41.840 --> 28:44.607
where he was treated
for severe dehydration.

28:44.609 --> 28:45.742
Rushed my son
to keep him safe.

28:45.744 --> 28:47.277
What I'm interested in

28:47.279 --> 28:49.379
is how he got dehydrated
in the first place.

28:49.381 --> 28:51.080
He was running laps.

28:51.082 --> 28:52.248
Hadn't you had
an argument

28:52.250 --> 28:53.783
about going pro
the night before?

28:53.785 --> 28:55.618
Yes.

28:55.620 --> 28:58.922
And you wanted to teach him
a lesson, as was your right.

28:58.924 --> 29:01.057
What?

29:01.059 --> 29:03.593
He questioned your authority,
didn't he?

29:03.595 --> 29:05.094
He's done it before,
hasn't he?

29:05.096 --> 29:06.562
And you don't like that,
do you?

29:06.564 --> 29:08.231
- You are twisting this.
- You got angry,

29:08.233 --> 29:10.366
you flew off the handle,
and you became abusive.

29:10.368 --> 29:11.734
Objection, badgering.

29:11.736 --> 29:13.102
Easy, Mr. Ross.

29:13.104 --> 29:14.837
Marco
has never called 911.

29:14.839 --> 29:17.240
He's never reported me
to social services.

29:17.242 --> 29:18.274
He's never complained
to anyone.

29:18.276 --> 29:19.709
They never do.

29:19.711 --> 29:21.811
You think I put my own son
in the hospital?

29:21.813 --> 29:23.546
Oh, I've read this report.
I know you did.

29:23.548 --> 29:24.814
And I know you will again.

29:24.816 --> 29:27.250
You are a lying
little piece of shit.

29:27.252 --> 29:29.619
- And there it is.
- Mr. Mendoza, that's enough.

29:32.756 --> 29:35.625
No further questions.

29:41.266 --> 29:43.433
Oh, what the hell?
You don't sneak up like that.

29:43.435 --> 29:46.336
I wasn't sneaking up.
I was just getting coffee.

29:46.338 --> 29:48.204
Yeah, well,
the paralegal needs coffee.

29:48.206 --> 29:50.373
I guess the junior partner
needs to get out of her way.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.075
You know what, Louis,
if you treated people here

29:52.077 --> 29:53.810
just a tenth as nicely
as you treat your cat,

29:53.812 --> 29:56.212
they might not feel about you
the way that you know they do.

29:56.214 --> 29:58.214
I'm sorry.

29:58.216 --> 29:59.816
Is everything okay?

29:59.818 --> 30:03.920
No, I just have, like,
a condition with my tear ducts.

30:03.922 --> 30:06.422
Oh, my God.

30:08.659 --> 30:10.159
I just assumed
that he wasn't eating

30:10.161 --> 30:12.895
because of his toothache...

30:12.897 --> 30:16.933
but it turns out
his hygiene was perfect.

30:16.935 --> 30:20.336
But of course it was, because
we flossed every day, so...

30:22.106 --> 30:24.207
And then they did these tests.

30:24.209 --> 30:27.210
And I told the vet,
"money is no object,"

30:27.212 --> 30:31.180
but, uh...

30:31.182 --> 30:33.549
it was too late.

30:33.551 --> 30:36.519
Bruno was suffering...

30:36.521 --> 30:39.822
Excuse me.
No-

30:45.229 --> 30:48.164
- hey.
- Hey.

30:48.166 --> 30:52.135
- Is everything okay?
- Not exactly.

30:52.137 --> 30:53.903
Okay, I'll come back
when you're finished.

30:53.905 --> 30:55.271
I wasn't
talking about you.

30:55.273 --> 30:57.206
Not everything's about you,
you know.

30:57.208 --> 30:59.308
Now, you see,
that's where you're wrong.

31:00.544 --> 31:02.879
What's going on
with Donna?

31:02.881 --> 31:04.180
I don't know.

31:04.182 --> 31:06.315
What do you mean?

31:06.317 --> 31:08.551
I saw you watching us
the other day.

31:08.553 --> 31:12.488
You know something.

31:12.490 --> 31:15.725
Come on, Mike, how many secrets
are you gonna keep from me?

31:15.727 --> 31:18.728
It's not mine.
It's Donna's.

31:18.730 --> 31:20.396
I'm not saying you need
to give me specifics.

31:20.398 --> 31:24.167
I just need to know
that she's okay.

31:26.370 --> 31:30.339
She screwed up,
and it's not small.

31:30.341 --> 31:34.677
- What's gonna happen?
- Harvey's going to fix it.

31:34.679 --> 31:36.345
How do you know?

31:36.347 --> 31:39.015
You're gonna fix this
situation with Donna, right?

31:39.017 --> 31:41.484
- Why should I tell you?
- What?

31:41.486 --> 31:42.785
If I hadn't caught you,
when were you gonna tell me

31:42.787 --> 31:44.153
that she had that memo?

31:44.155 --> 31:45.588
I wasn't, 'cause
she promised me she would.

31:45.590 --> 31:47.256
Well, what would have
happened if you hadn't been

31:47.258 --> 31:49.492
in my office when Jessica
brought me that affidavit?

31:49.494 --> 31:50.693
That would've been
between you and Donna.

31:50.695 --> 31:53.396
And I would have
committed perjury.

31:53.398 --> 31:55.631
You're right.
I should have told you,

31:55.633 --> 31:58.534
or had Donna tell you then
and there, but I was thinking

31:58.536 --> 32:00.870
the fact that she actually
found this thing helps us.

32:00.872 --> 32:02.805
Yeah,
it would've helped us.

32:02.807 --> 32:05.475
She destroyed it.

32:05.477 --> 32:07.276
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

32:07.278 --> 32:08.644
Whoa.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.046
Harvey, she was
backed into a corner.

32:10.048 --> 32:11.380
She made a bad call.

32:11.382 --> 32:12.849
Look, we can still--
Tell the truth?

32:12.851 --> 32:14.851
How do you think
that's going to play in court?

32:18.455 --> 32:20.790
Oh, my God.
Um, I have to go.

32:20.792 --> 32:22.058
You screwed up with Marco,
didn't you?

32:22.060 --> 32:23.392
I'm on it.

32:23.394 --> 32:25.394
And this thing with Donna,
just let it go.

32:25.396 --> 32:28.831
I'm sure she said she was sorry.
She is sorry.

32:28.833 --> 32:32.034
But she never said it.

32:35.172 --> 32:37.106
Didn't expect
to see you today.

32:37.108 --> 32:38.975
I wanted to get you the offer
as soon as I could.

32:38.977 --> 32:40.276
You could have called.

32:40.278 --> 32:42.712
No, I couldn't.

32:42.714 --> 32:44.547
Tanner's terms.

32:44.549 --> 32:45.982
The firm pays
$5 million in damages,

32:45.984 --> 32:47.150
as well as all legal fees.

32:47.152 --> 32:49.752
What else?

32:49.754 --> 32:51.854
Pearson Hardman
immediately and irrevocably

32:51.856 --> 32:56.292
strips Harvey Specter
of his senior partnership

32:56.294 --> 32:59.462
and reports him to
the New York Bar Association.

32:59.464 --> 33:01.564
I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

33:01.566 --> 33:05.735
but I would
take this deal and run.

33:11.942 --> 33:14.977
What do you want now?

33:14.979 --> 33:17.613
Sell me a vacuum cleaner?
Set of steak knives?

33:17.615 --> 33:18.748
I don't want
to sell you anything.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.550
I'm not here to do that.

33:20.552 --> 33:22.785
I'm here to tell you
that I'm sorry.

33:22.787 --> 33:26.455
I should have known
about that memo.

33:26.457 --> 33:28.024
But I didn't do my job.

33:28.026 --> 33:29.892
If I had, you and I
wouldn't be here right now.

33:29.894 --> 33:30.893
But we are here
right now

33:30.895 --> 33:33.563
because of what you did
to my husband.

33:33.565 --> 33:36.199
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

33:36.201 --> 33:37.800
I never should have done it.

33:37.802 --> 33:41.904
My mother marched,
Mr. lawyer.

33:41.906 --> 33:45.107
They set dogs on her.
I saw the scars.

33:45.109 --> 33:47.743
She said it wasn't the dogs,
it was the men.

33:47.745 --> 33:50.913
I say,
put those dogs down.

33:53.148 --> 33:54.682
So you think
we should take this deal?

33:55.528 --> 33:57.495
I think we have to.

33:57.497 --> 33:59.163
Just say it.

33:59.165 --> 34:01.232
You want me
to cut Harvey loose.

34:01.234 --> 34:03.100
You've never been afraid
to spill blood before.

34:03.102 --> 34:04.902
You means yours.

34:04.904 --> 34:06.437
I was actually referring
to when you and I

34:06.439 --> 34:08.272
crossed the other names
off the letterhead.

34:08.274 --> 34:10.007
That was for
the good of the firm.

34:10.009 --> 34:12.143
Was it?

34:15.013 --> 34:16.781
Evidence was destroyed,
Jessica.

34:16.783 --> 34:20.284
- Not by Harvey.
- On his watch, therefore...

34:20.286 --> 34:21.319
On mine.

34:21.321 --> 34:22.753
If this were
anyone else,

34:22.755 --> 34:24.021
you'd be seeing it
the same way I do.

34:24.023 --> 34:26.190
I'm not scapegoating him.

34:26.192 --> 34:28.659
You care about Harvey.
I know that.

34:28.661 --> 34:29.827
But I also know
that you care about

34:29.829 --> 34:31.929
your position in this firm.

34:31.931 --> 34:33.630
A law was broken.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.933
Are you really going
to sit by and do nothing?

34:40.239 --> 34:42.139
I've got to call you back.

34:42.141 --> 34:44.542
Did you get it?
Got it right here,

34:44.543 --> 34:46.377
fully executed emancipation.

34:46.379 --> 34:47.645
You tell Marco yet?

34:47.647 --> 34:48.446
No, I wanted you
to see it first.

34:48.447 --> 34:49.746
Nice job.

34:49.748 --> 34:50.947
This way I can call him
with the good news.

34:50.949 --> 34:53.918
- Yeah, just one problem.
- What's that?

34:53.920 --> 34:55.786
Marco lied.

34:55.788 --> 34:57.521
- What?
- Yeah.

34:57.523 --> 34:59.023
We got backed
into a corner,

34:59.025 --> 35:00.591
and he knew the truth
wouldn't play in court,

35:00.593 --> 35:02.960
so he made up a story.

35:02.962 --> 35:05.329
If it was a lie, Michael,
then why didn't Oscar say so?

35:05.331 --> 35:06.797
Marco perjured himself.

35:06.799 --> 35:08.099
You really think his father

35:08.101 --> 35:09.500
was going to be the one
to point that out?

35:09.502 --> 35:11.202
- That's a lot of conjecture.
- Yeah, it would be.

35:11.204 --> 35:13.204
But I went to see Oscar.

35:13.206 --> 35:15.806
Turns out he wasn't even there
when Marco ran those laps.

35:15.808 --> 35:17.742
But you were.
Nuhuh, it's bullshit.

35:17.744 --> 35:19.810
I saw the look
on your face in court.

35:19.812 --> 35:22.280
You knew,
and you did nothing.

35:25.117 --> 35:27.618
You got me.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.086
But it doesn't matter,
'cause we won.

35:29.088 --> 35:30.521
No, we didn't.

35:30.523 --> 35:33.257
'Cause I'm not filing papers
based on a lie.

35:33.259 --> 35:34.659
Harvey is gonna make you
regret that.

35:34.661 --> 35:37.828
Harvey's not
gonna do shit.

35:37.830 --> 35:41.432
This is my case,
and you are done.

35:50.943 --> 35:56.447
♪

35:56.449 --> 35:58.416
We need to talk.

35:58.418 --> 36:00.418
It's subtle, but Daniel's
strong-arming me.

36:00.420 --> 36:01.419
Not now.

36:01.421 --> 36:03.621
My dad.

36:03.623 --> 36:11.595
♪

36:18.403 --> 36:19.804
I was wrong.

36:19.806 --> 36:22.406
Am I in
the right office?

36:22.408 --> 36:24.842
I went to
the plaintiffs again.

36:24.844 --> 36:26.911
Why?

36:26.913 --> 36:28.379
To tell them
I was sorry.

36:28.381 --> 36:31.315
Harvey, there is
a deal on the table.

36:31.317 --> 36:34.085
Allison's right.

36:34.087 --> 36:36.454
I shouldn't be the lawyer.

36:36.456 --> 36:38.989
I don't even
make a good client.

36:38.991 --> 36:42.126
Neither do I.

36:42.128 --> 36:45.329
But I've got some hard news
I have to tell you.

36:48.266 --> 36:49.767
Okay, let me guess,

36:49.769 --> 36:51.202
you're here
to take me up on my offer

36:51.204 --> 36:53.137
to trade offices.
No.

36:53.139 --> 36:56.207
But I did happen
to find these.

36:56.209 --> 36:57.441
Who still eats Twinkies?

36:57.443 --> 37:00.244
Who doesn't
still eat Twinkies?

37:00.246 --> 37:02.880
What's up?

37:02.882 --> 37:05.416
- I need a favor.
- Okay, what?

37:05.418 --> 37:07.685
Is this from
your tennis client?

37:07.687 --> 37:09.620
First one.

37:09.622 --> 37:11.389
Not as big
as Harvey's.

37:11.391 --> 37:12.890
Really?
You're gonna go there?

37:12.892 --> 37:15.025
It's probably gonna be
worth a lot of money someday.

37:15.027 --> 37:16.761
- Probably.
- I need it.

37:16.763 --> 37:18.129
It's important.

37:18.131 --> 37:20.898
What for?

37:20.900 --> 37:23.934
Why don't we
just call that my secret?

37:30.943 --> 37:32.410
Daniel,

37:32.412 --> 37:36.247
will you come to
my office right now please?

37:42.888 --> 37:44.255
Have a seat.

37:44.257 --> 37:46.690
Couldn't we have done this
in my office?

37:46.692 --> 37:49.894
Yes, we could have,
but I prefer to do it here...

37:49.896 --> 37:52.963
in your old office.

37:55.133 --> 37:56.600
What's this?

37:56.602 --> 37:58.736
I want you to
let Allison Holt go.

37:58.738 --> 38:00.938
- Why would I do that?
- Why you?

38:00.940 --> 38:03.073
Because you brought her in
initially.

38:03.075 --> 38:06.110
I am extending you
the courtesy of letting her go.

38:06.112 --> 38:08.646
As for why at all,

38:08.648 --> 38:11.916
I do care about
my position in this firm

38:11.918 --> 38:14.785
and my position
is that we win.

38:14.787 --> 38:17.621
We win, Harvey wins,

38:17.623 --> 38:18.622
and I win.

38:18.624 --> 38:20.191
Allison Holt can't win,

38:20.193 --> 38:21.792
because she doesn't
believe in Harvey.

38:21.794 --> 38:24.695
I can, because I do.

38:24.697 --> 38:26.797
- It's your decision.
- It is.

38:26.799 --> 38:30.100
But don't try to pass it off
as a courtesy.

38:30.102 --> 38:32.369
You're trying
to humiliate me,

38:32.371 --> 38:34.605
like you did by summoning me
into your office.

38:34.607 --> 38:37.775
I summoned you because
I wanted you to understand

38:37.777 --> 38:39.677
who you were
threatening earlier.

38:39.679 --> 38:42.279
I wasn't threatening you.

38:42.281 --> 38:44.815
I was pointing out facts.
Yes.

38:44.817 --> 38:46.650
The fact that,
if I'm not careful,

38:46.652 --> 38:48.252
you'll try to take
this office back.

38:48.254 --> 38:50.221
That's not going to happen.

38:50.223 --> 38:55.593
And as for your point
about a law being broken,

38:55.595 --> 38:57.495
you're right.

38:57.497 --> 39:00.731
I'm not going to sit by
and do nothing.

39:02.234 --> 39:05.202
Louis, can I come in?

39:05.204 --> 39:09.773
I'm a little busy
right now.

39:11.409 --> 39:14.144
Where'd you get this?

39:14.146 --> 39:17.948
I just know what
a huge tennis fan you are.

39:24.523 --> 39:27.291
Rachel...

39:30.495 --> 39:33.531
could you just close
the door on your way out?

39:33.533 --> 39:36.567
Sure thing, Louis.

39:56.788 --> 39:59.290
Harvey's not here.
He should be back soon.

39:59.292 --> 40:01.058
I'm not here
to see Harvey.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.594
Oh.

40:03.596 --> 40:07.565
He wanted to be the one to
have this conversation with you.

40:07.567 --> 40:08.999
But it's my firm,

40:09.001 --> 40:11.802
and I wanted you
to hear it from me.

40:11.804 --> 40:13.504
Am I being fired?

40:13.506 --> 40:16.574
Yes.

40:16.576 --> 40:18.576
I appreciate everything
that you've done

40:18.578 --> 40:20.311
for Harvey and for me,

40:20.313 --> 40:23.547
but whatever
my personal feelings,

40:23.549 --> 40:26.650
your actions
have left me no choice

40:26.652 --> 40:28.886
but to terminate your employment
at Pearson Hardman

40:28.888 --> 40:31.288
effective immediately.

41:06.025 --> 41:14.064
♪

41:33.318 --> 41:36.286
You said
he was going to fix it.

41:38.323 --> 41:39.423
I thought he would.
