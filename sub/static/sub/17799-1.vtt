00:49.834 --> 00:52.687
Could I have a bit of
quiet, please girls...

00:53.451 --> 00:55.357
Célestine... come with me.

01:00.457 --> 01:02.452
Célestine...

01:02.542 --> 01:05.958
...I have an extremely
good position for you.

01:06.334 --> 01:10.084
It will, though, mean moving to
the country... but not very far.

01:10.251 --> 01:13.459
"To the country"?
You know I wouldn't be keen on that.

01:13.667 --> 01:16.312
There are excellent positions
in the country.

01:16.792 --> 01:21.054
That's a joke!
There's not a good position anywhere.

01:21.376 --> 01:24.709
On the contrary, Célestine...
there's not a bad position.

01:24.917 --> 01:27.709
I know...
There are only bad masters.

01:27.917 --> 01:30.334
No...
only bad servants.

01:31.584 --> 01:36.334
I give you the very best houses...
Why don't you stay?

01:36.917 --> 01:39.334
You're intelligent...

01:39.501 --> 01:43.084
You carry yourself well...
You're attractive...

01:43.292 --> 01:46.459
You'd be happy, with the right behaviour.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.501
Except it'll be bad behaviour.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.292
Well, THAT's what I call behaviour.

01:52.501 --> 01:53.959
"That" meaning what?

01:54.167 --> 01:56.167
What do you imagine it means?

01:56.667 --> 01:58.126
I don't imagine anything.

02:01.001 --> 02:05.459
I don't think I'm going
to be able to rely on you.

02:06.776 --> 02:07.994
It doesn't matter.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.542
I promise MY behaviour will be right.

02:10.709 --> 02:12.788
I can assure you I know
how to behave.

02:12.878 --> 02:15.792
You can rely on me.

02:16.001 --> 02:20.209
You're unstable...
You're not reliable.

02:22.167 --> 02:23.418
If you say so.

02:27.959 --> 02:30.376
Get yourself focussed...
and come back tomorrow...

02:30.542 --> 02:32.467
The position will still be available.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.167
- Are you the one from Paris?
- Yes, that's me.

04:09.126 --> 04:10.167
Down!

04:10.417 --> 04:11.459
Down!

04:57.001 --> 04:58.042
Madame...

05:00.126 --> 05:02.134
That's fine...
Thank you, Joseph.

05:08.167 --> 05:10.461
You have lovely clothes,
young lady.

05:10.551 --> 05:11.909
Thank you, ma'am.

05:11.976 --> 05:15.792
-You'll change them right away,
won't you? -Yes, ma'am.

05:17.459 --> 05:20.959
Tell me about your last position, please.

05:21.126 --> 05:23.876
It was in Paris...
The home of a young couple.

05:24.042 --> 05:26.001
There were 4 servants.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.876
- Was the house large?
- Yes, ma'am.

05:30.084 --> 05:34.417
- Who was responsible for the upkeep?
- The valet and myself.

05:35.417 --> 05:36.876
Are you honest?

05:37.792 --> 05:39.167
Certainly, ma'am.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.417
Are you clumsy?

05:42.584 --> 05:44.001
No, ma'am.

05:44.209 --> 05:46.667
Why did you leave that house?

05:46.834 --> 05:50.292
Your masters seemed happy
with your work.

05:50.501 --> 05:53.584
It's just that I wasn't happy
in Paris any more.

05:53.792 --> 05:55.650
Are you prone to mood-swings?

05:55.959 --> 05:57.626
No, ma'am.

05:57.834 --> 06:00.751
- Are you from Paris originally?
- No.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.876
I'm Breton... from Audierne.

06:06.626 --> 06:07.667
Follow me.

06:08.917 --> 06:13.001
I'll show you around the house
and explain your tasks.

06:13.167 --> 06:16.626
There are certain things
I need to stress.

06:18.059 --> 06:22.376
I'm very attached to this frame, girl...

06:22.542 --> 06:23.984
It's very valuable.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.188
You will ensure it's dusted thoroughly,
especially in the grooves.

06:27.278 --> 06:29.291
Without scratching it, of course.

06:30.459 --> 06:33.584
As for this, girl...
it's very rare and very expensive.

06:33.751 --> 06:37.501
You'll not see another like it.
You'll need to be careful with it.

06:42.584 --> 06:43.626
Follow me.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.584
This lamp comes from England.

07:01.751 --> 07:06.042
It's very expensive, girl... and we'd
have to get it repaired over there.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.417
Take care of it as if it were
your own special thing.

07:11.667 --> 07:12.917
Follow me.

07:13.959 --> 07:16.917
Would you send a cracked chamber-pot
to London?

07:40.042 --> 07:41.584
Here it is.

08:12.584 --> 08:15.501
Are you the new maid?

08:15.667 --> 08:17.542
Yes sir... I am.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.126
That's good... That's good.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.959
So you're here?

08:23.126 --> 08:24.417
That's very good.

08:24.584 --> 08:25.834
That's very good.

08:26.751 --> 08:29.683
- So you come from Paris?
- Yes, sir.

08:31.042 --> 08:32.626
That's very good.

08:32.792 --> 08:34.208
Very good.

08:36.292 --> 08:38.001
What's your name?

08:39.208 --> 08:40.583
Célestine, sir.

08:41.292 --> 08:42.667
"Célestine."

08:43.542 --> 08:45.542
That's very good.
That's very good.

08:47.417 --> 08:50.155
Not a common name...
A pretty name, by jove!

08:51.626 --> 08:54.751
As long as Madame doesn't
make you change it.

08:56.417 --> 08:58.709
I do as Madame requires.

09:01.251 --> 09:02.501
Yes, yes.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.584
Well, Célestine...

09:11.501 --> 09:14.084
...for I shall always
call you Célestine...

09:14.251 --> 09:18.417
Perhaps you'll help me
remove my boots?

09:18.584 --> 09:20.084
Certainly, sir.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.998
Because, you see,
these damned boots...

09:26.501 --> 09:29.084
...they're difficult...
they get stuck.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.609
Good heavens!
You smell awfully good!

09:38.751 --> 09:39.792
Me, sir?

09:39.959 --> 09:41.709
Yeah, YOU, by God!...

09:41.876 --> 09:45.001
- I hardly think it's my feet!
- No, sir.

09:45.209 --> 09:48.126
- You smell awfully good!
- There you are, sir!

09:53.692 --> 09:55.559
Are you living here now, Célestine?

09:55.667 --> 09:57.841
I've been here 3 hours, sir.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.001
Would you get me my slippers?

10:03.501 --> 10:04.959
I must apologise.

10:05.459 --> 10:07.251
Sir, this is my job.

10:07.709 --> 10:10.584
They're under the stairs,
on the left.

10:11.626 --> 10:13.959
I could lead this one a long way.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.417
You're not eating?

10:28.334 --> 10:29.584
I'm not hungry.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.292
You'd eat truffles.

10:32.501 --> 10:35.501
I HAVE eaten truffles, you know.

10:40.584 --> 10:43.626
You've had good positions before.

10:43.792 --> 10:44.667
Sure have.

10:44.876 --> 10:46.417
Excellent positions.

10:50.084 --> 10:53.126
Is this the first time
you've worked in the country?

10:53.292 --> 10:57.702
No, I worked for a man in Touraine.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.167
That was five years ago now.

11:00.334 --> 11:04.834
And then, in Normandy, for a woman
from Paris and her little boy...

11:05.542 --> 11:06.834
He was sick.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.459
- You know the country then.
- No, nothing about around here.

11:11.626 --> 11:13.459
That was on the coast.

11:13.626 --> 11:15.917
The terrace lead onto a beach.

11:16.084 --> 11:19.709
I had a lovely room there...
a master bedroom.

11:27.584 --> 11:29.501
You don't miss Paris?

11:30.126 --> 11:31.667
Yes, a lot.

11:31.834 --> 11:34.626
But good positions
are hard to get in Paris.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.527
Sir and Madame are good masters.

11:48.135 --> 11:49.628
Does he go after maids?

11:49.718 --> 11:50.757
What?

11:52.126 --> 11:55.251
Does he have a thing
for maids?

11:57.376 --> 12:00.709
It's not the sort of question
you should ask... Not correct.

12:06.209 --> 12:07.255
And Madame?

12:07.751 --> 12:10.787
What about Madame?

12:10.877 --> 12:12.377
Does she have a lover?

12:14.084 --> 12:16.417
It's clear you come from Paris...

12:16.834 --> 12:18.384
...or God knows where.

13:20.084 --> 13:22.176
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.813
Be so good as to follow me...

13:27.334 --> 13:28.584
With your luggage.

14:11.292 --> 14:13.417
- Anything to declare?
- No.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.209
Open this trunk.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.626
- There's nothing in it!
- Open it anyway.

14:19.873 --> 14:21.119
Open it!

14:24.584 --> 14:26.001
No, please.

14:28.792 --> 14:30.126
Good heavens, but...

14:33.042 --> 14:34.834
So what do we have here?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.292
Jewellery.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.792
Open it.

14:38.959 --> 14:41.584
I told you...
It's jewellery.

14:41.751 --> 14:42.667
Open...

14:42.876 --> 14:44.376
...this box.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.751
No. This is abuse of authority.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.543
And I don't have the key.

14:49.145 --> 14:52.421
If you don't open it, I'll have to fetch
the superintendent.

14:53.001 --> 14:55.084
I will complain, do you hear?

14:55.251 --> 14:56.084
Open it.

14:56.251 --> 14:58.251
I can't. I can't open it.

14:58.459 --> 14:59.959
Open it.

15:01.626 --> 15:04.207
Keep these people away
and I'll open it.

15:04.297 --> 15:05.376
Open this box.

15:24.417 --> 15:25.667
Move aside!

15:25.834 --> 15:27.084
Move aside!

15:44.042 --> 15:46.810
I should declare that the box is yours.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.684
That's very good of you, Madame...

15:48.774 --> 15:51.621
...but I prefer the real-life type
of that jewellery.

15:52.876 --> 15:54.917
You're a little fool!

15:55.084 --> 15:57.825
- Where have you been?
- With Customs.

16:09.709 --> 16:13.542
At The Priory,
they never hang on to a maid...

16:13.709 --> 16:16.792
Either she sacks them
or he knocks them up.

16:16.959 --> 16:20.126
Pretty ones, ugly ones,
young ones, old ones...

16:20.292 --> 16:21.876
One bang and there's a kid.

16:22.042 --> 16:25.001
A word of advice...
keep clear of Mr Lanlaire.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.718
Beware of that man.

16:33.917 --> 16:36.792
You've got time...
Come in for a moment.

16:36.959 --> 16:39.084
Thank you... later perhaps.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.969
"And a branch shall
grow out of his roots..."

17:25.059 --> 17:28.001
This is the new vicar.
I recommend him.

17:29.167 --> 17:32.792
There is nobody like him
for confessing women!

17:33.792 --> 17:36.209
The spirit of wisdom and understanding...

17:36.376 --> 17:38.459
"The spirit of counsel and might..."

17:39.001 --> 17:42.126
"...the spirit of knowledge
and fear of the Lord."

17:42.292 --> 17:44.792
"And He will not judge
by what His eyes see..."

17:44.959 --> 17:47.376
"Nor make a decision
by what His ears hear…"

17:47.542 --> 17:49.876
"With righteousness
he shall judge the poor..."

17:50.542 --> 17:53.876
"...and decide with equity
for the meek of the earth."

17:55.792 --> 17:59.032
After, I'll take you
to Mrs Gouin, the milliner's...

17:59.376 --> 18:01.917
A very kind and clever woman...

18:02.526 --> 18:06.501
The saviour of these parts...
You saw her earlier.

18:07.334 --> 18:09.334
She does abortions, you see.

18:09.501 --> 18:12.042
"The leopard shall lie
down with the kid..."

18:12.209 --> 18:15.542
"The calf and the young lion
will eat together..."

18:24.959 --> 18:27.138
A lovely day today, Mr Joseph.

18:27.908 --> 18:29.634
Yes.

18:34.751 --> 18:36.542
Look them in the eyes.

18:41.959 --> 18:43.084
In the eyes.

18:48.459 --> 18:49.501
Fine.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.709
Célestine, I want to see you!

19:25.126 --> 19:28.001
In future,
would you please get back earlier.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.959
She's starting to annoy me.

19:30.126 --> 19:32.876
- What did you say?
- Nothing, ma'am.

19:32.942 --> 19:34.517
A fine state of affairs...

19:34.626 --> 19:37.417
Everything is behind this morning
because of you.

19:40.792 --> 19:42.251
Now go and do my room.

19:43.651 --> 19:45.559
You cow... you're getting me mad.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.792
I'll talk with whoever I want...
I'll see who I choose to.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.751
You'll not lay down the law to me.

20:16.292 --> 20:18.626
Even her clothes.

20:18.792 --> 20:22.751
The sex-starved idiot
thinks I'd steal her petticoats.

20:35.751 --> 20:38.167
Did you see everyone at mass?

20:38.334 --> 20:41.876
- I met Miss Rose.
- Ah, Miss Rose.

20:42.042 --> 20:43.751
She can sure talk, that one!

20:44.376 --> 20:48.209
She tells the whole country
what she'll inherit from her master.

20:48.376 --> 20:52.209
A very bad man.
Though he used to be a captain.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.001
Yes, that's what she told me.

20:55.167 --> 20:58.751
He spends his time throwing stones
into our garden.

20:58.917 --> 21:01.501
The master and he
get along very badly.

21:01.667 --> 21:04.792
He spoils all of Mr Joseph's work...

21:04.959 --> 21:07.542
...which sends Mr Joseph
into a frenzy of rage.

21:10.959 --> 21:14.709
Did you start here
the same time as Mr Joseph?

21:14.876 --> 21:15.917
No.

21:16.709 --> 21:21.334
I started 3 years after him.
There was another cook before me.

21:23.126 --> 21:25.834
- Do you know him well?
- For sure.

21:26.751 --> 21:28.626
He's a great guy.

21:30.501 --> 21:33.334
He looks after The Priory
as if it was his own.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.792
The mistress says
he'd walk through fire for her.

21:36.959 --> 21:40.376
He rejects all the
enticements he receives.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.542
Joseph's a man you can trust.

21:42.709 --> 21:43.876
Célestine!

21:45.001 --> 21:46.334
Célestine!

21:49.209 --> 21:50.459
Yes, Madame?

21:50.667 --> 21:52.584
Bring me a needle.

21:53.917 --> 21:56.084
Why are you walking around
with that?

21:57.334 --> 22:00.501
I was washing it
when you called me, Madame.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.501
And you do that slowly.

22:45.084 --> 22:46.459
Damn! Damn! Damn!

22:59.126 --> 23:01.626
Don't you listen?
Are you deaf?

23:02.584 --> 23:04.251
Here's your needle, Madame.

23:08.459 --> 23:10.792
Bring me some thread.

23:31.041 --> 23:33.459
Good. Now bring me the scissors.

23:34.001 --> 23:35.251
And hurry up!

23:56.126 --> 23:57.367
What's the matter?

23:57.709 --> 23:58.584
Nothing.

23:58.751 --> 24:00.834
So why are you carrying on like that?

24:01.001 --> 24:03.459
I don't like miserable looks.

24:03.626 --> 24:06.001
You have a disagreeable manner.

24:07.292 --> 24:09.167
Dis you find the scissors?

24:12.167 --> 24:14.376
Now go and set the table.

24:14.542 --> 24:17.459
I don't pay you to lounge about.

25:00.292 --> 25:03.501
I hope you're getting
used to it here, Célestine.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.126
Yes, I certainly am, Sir.

25:05.292 --> 25:06.542
That's nice to hear.

25:06.709 --> 25:09.876
That's not bad...
Not bad at all!

25:10.834 --> 25:13.459
Did you have to fool around, in Paris?

25:13.626 --> 25:15.542
Do you fool around?

25:15.709 --> 25:16.876
- Sir.
- What?

25:17.084 --> 25:21.167
A lovely girl like you...
you'd have to fool around!

25:22.959 --> 25:25.376
So much the better...
I'm all for having fun.

25:25.542 --> 25:26.917
I believe in love.

25:27.084 --> 25:30.459
I'm not like your other housemaids...

25:30.626 --> 25:32.738
I'm an honest girl.

25:33.876 --> 25:36.834
I really should complain
to your wife.

25:37.001 --> 25:38.042
No, no...

25:38.209 --> 25:40.751
- Do you like pears?
- Yes sir.

25:40.959 --> 25:43.501
Here... hide it in your pocket.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.709
- Does anyone else give you pears?
- No, Sir.

25:47.917 --> 25:50.376
I'll give you more sometimes...

25:50.542 --> 25:52.876
Because I want you to be happy.

25:53.651 --> 25:54.892
Please, Sir!...

25:54.959 --> 25:58.542
- What if Madame were to see you?
- What "Madame"? What "Madame"?

25:58.709 --> 26:01.542
I don't care.
I'm fed up with her.

26:02.876 --> 26:04.126
You're wrong sir..

26:04.292 --> 26:07.473
Your wife is a very nice woman.

26:07.563 --> 26:08.684
God almighty!

26:08.792 --> 26:10.917
She's a bitch... a total bitch...

26:11.084 --> 26:12.584
My wife is a bitch!

26:12.751 --> 26:16.314
You, you are so nice,
so good...

26:16.404 --> 26:17.876
Come now, Sir!...

26:17.942 --> 26:19.226
Come, come, Sir!

26:19.292 --> 26:21.792
- If you'd like to...
- If I'd like to what?

26:21.959 --> 26:23.876
You know very well what.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.334
To deceive Madame with her husband?

26:26.501 --> 26:29.251
To do dirty things with you?

26:29.459 --> 26:32.584
- You don't imagine...
- I imagine everything!

26:32.792 --> 26:35.862
One more word
and I'll tell Madame everything.

26:38.334 --> 26:39.792
Célestine.

27:08.084 --> 27:11.001
Have you finished your work
in the garden?

27:11.167 --> 27:12.417
Yes.

27:38.251 --> 27:41.709
- I've come for some hot water.
- I'll free some space.

27:41.876 --> 27:43.126
No hurry.

27:44.542 --> 27:48.084
- Isn't Madame home yet?
- No, not yet.

27:53.917 --> 27:57.459
Have you seen what Mr Joseph
found in the garden?

27:57.626 --> 28:00.042
Mr. Joseph isn't very talkative
with me.

28:00.209 --> 28:03.542
It's just that he doesn't know you.
Don't take it personally.

28:04.584 --> 28:08.792
Mr Joseph found an old slipper
in the garden.

28:08.959 --> 28:12.917
The captain again. You should've seen
what Mr Joseph sent him.

28:16.209 --> 28:19.667
Célestine, would you get me
some bread and cheese.

28:20.917 --> 28:23.001
And some cider as well.

28:38.001 --> 28:41.297
- You're eating here?
- I was a little peckish.

28:41.398 --> 28:44.369
-And what are YOU doing here?
-I came to get hot water.

28:44.459 --> 28:48.096
-There's laundry to be done and the
table's not ready. -Off with you!

28:55.876 --> 28:58.384
Please go sleep with her
and get her off my back!

29:17.626 --> 29:20.209
- Yes, Ma'am?
- Go pick up the dogs' meat, right away.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.001
The dogs of the rich live well.

30:12.042 --> 30:14.126
This is nice... Eh, darling?

30:35.709 --> 30:39.084
I already told you
I don't want you using perfume.

30:41.667 --> 30:42.917
Did you hear me?

30:43.459 --> 30:45.001
Very well, Ma'am.

30:45.167 --> 30:47.626
What you need is a good rogering.

30:51.484 --> 30:55.351
To think that the cook has the lives
of her masters in her hands every day.

30:57.292 --> 30:59.709
A pinch of arsenic instead of salt...

30:59.876 --> 31:02.667
...a dollop of strychnine
instead of vinegar...

31:02.834 --> 31:04.376
...and it's done.

31:06.126 --> 31:07.834
But no...

31:08.001 --> 31:11.876
...One has to resist the temptation.

31:24.709 --> 31:27.444
If you like prunes... ask me.

31:27.534 --> 31:28.952
I beg your pardon?

31:29.042 --> 31:32.584
If you like prunes... ask me.

31:32.792 --> 31:35.251
But I forbid you to take them.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.709
I'm not a thief, ma'am.

31:37.876 --> 31:41.251
I'm telling you
that you've taken some prunes.

31:41.417 --> 31:45.876
If you believe me to be a thief, ma'am,
you've no choice but to dismiss me.

31:46.042 --> 31:48.501
Mr Lanlaire ate 5 this morning.

31:48.667 --> 31:51.209
There were 21.
Now there are only 14.

31:51.417 --> 31:54.959
You've stolen two.
Don't let it happen again.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.959
She counts the prunes!

32:22.709 --> 32:25.376
Captain!
It's Miss Célestine...

32:25.584 --> 32:28.084
...the Lanlaires' maid.

32:39.042 --> 32:41.292
Mr and Mrs Lanlaire are in town.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.001
- I wanted to grab the chance.
- Good idea!

32:44.167 --> 32:46.936
Julien, go fetch the bottle of Noyau.

32:47.026 --> 32:49.526
Is he still standing,
that Lanlaire of yours?

32:50.042 --> 32:52.584
It's the worst house to end up in.

32:52.751 --> 32:57.042
There was once a time
when we were friends with Mr. Lanlaire.

32:57.209 --> 33:01.209
Then he criticised me for not maintaining
my rank with my maid.

33:01.376 --> 33:03.737
If I took her to my bed,
what's that to him?

33:04.076 --> 33:07.376
A man alone...
it's just natural.

33:11.292 --> 33:12.626
He's a funny one!

33:18.126 --> 33:20.292
That pig deserves it!

33:20.501 --> 33:22.917
- He's young for his age.
- He sure is.

33:23.126 --> 33:26.626
- Would you like to see the garden?
- I'd love to.

33:27.667 --> 33:30.084
I'll get back to my work.

33:30.834 --> 33:34.084
I can't walk too much
because of my asthma.

33:37.376 --> 33:39.292
But don't be too long.

33:39.959 --> 33:42.126
Besides, I'm watching you.

33:43.917 --> 33:47.084
Yellow daylily... Hemerocallis.

33:51.834 --> 33:55.084
Mexican aster... Cosmos bipinnatus.

33:57.334 --> 33:58.786
Have you ever eaten it?

33:58.876 --> 34:01.127
- What do you mean?
- Well, I've eaten it.

34:01.217 --> 34:02.417
It's quite tasty.

34:02.584 --> 34:04.834
I've eaten all the flowers here.

34:05.709 --> 34:08.376
I eat everything, I do... everything!

34:09.333 --> 34:11.958
- For a reason, Captain?
- Certainly.

34:12.126 --> 34:15.042
Ane not just plants...
Animals, too.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.833
Animals that nobody has eaten.

34:22.501 --> 34:26.083
There are no insects or birds
that I haven't eaten.

34:26.251 --> 34:29.583
Skunks, snakes,
rats, caterpillars...

34:29.751 --> 34:32.708
I've eaten everything.
I was known for it.

34:33.708 --> 34:34.958
Here Kleber...

34:36.292 --> 34:37.626
Here Kleber...

34:38.167 --> 34:39.917
Come here, Kleber.

34:41.833 --> 34:42.958
Good Kleber!

34:43.417 --> 34:45.167
Pretty little Kleber...

34:45.333 --> 34:48.251
Have you ever seen a ferret as pet?

34:48.417 --> 34:49.833
He eats with us.

34:50.001 --> 34:52.583
I love him like a child.

34:52.751 --> 34:55.251
But you wouldn't eat your ferret.

34:55.417 --> 34:56.667
Kleber?

35:00.709 --> 35:03.167
Make me a stew tonight!

35:28.626 --> 35:30.584
Well, what are you waiting for?

35:32.917 --> 35:35.542
- My mother...
- What about your mother?

35:35.709 --> 35:37.042
She's dead.

35:37.584 --> 35:39.959
Now... now I have nobody!

35:43.292 --> 35:45.376
Oh... what a shame.

35:46.251 --> 35:49.834
But we can't let it interfere
with your work.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.084
Miss Célestine... come in.

36:15.042 --> 36:18.126
Mrs Mendelssohn has a proposition
to put to you.

36:22.251 --> 36:25.459
I've just been told
how very good you are...

36:25.626 --> 36:28.335
I believe you deserve the praise.

36:28.626 --> 36:32.042
You look intelligent, honest and cheerful.

36:32.209 --> 36:33.834
I find her very pleasing.

36:34.751 --> 36:39.001
I need someone trustworthy
for my grandson.

36:39.209 --> 36:41.542
It only needs someone
to speak to me nicely...

36:41.709 --> 36:44.209
...and not as though
I was some animal...

36:44.376 --> 36:46.667
...for me to feel quite moved.

36:46.876 --> 36:50.459
But don't stand there...
please be seated.

36:55.917 --> 36:59.084
The position I'm offering
is not really a cheerful one.

37:00.251 --> 37:04.084
That doesn't matter, Ma'am.
I'll do whatever you require of me.

37:20.334 --> 37:22.917
You'll be comfortable here, Mr George.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.709
Mr George.

37:44.084 --> 37:45.459
Come along.

37:54.084 --> 37:55.334
Lie down here.

38:07.876 --> 38:12.167
You'll be able to go bathing,
being by the sea.

38:12.334 --> 38:14.334
This will be handy,
as you'll see.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.334
Come with me, child...

38:17.459 --> 38:18.834
That's your room.

38:34.459 --> 38:35.501
Lovely!

38:41.459 --> 38:43.126
You like it, do you?

38:44.251 --> 38:45.709
You're very kind, Ma'am.

38:45.876 --> 38:46.917
Thank you.

38:47.542 --> 38:50.417
I'm going up to my room.
It's on the 1st floor.

38:50.584 --> 38:52.959
I'll come with you, Ma'am.

39:13.292 --> 39:15.334
What's the matter, Ma'am?

39:19.376 --> 39:21.792
You shouldn't let it get you down.

39:21.959 --> 39:24.667
Mr. George is going to do very well here.

39:24.834 --> 39:26.959
But the way he's coughing!

39:29.209 --> 39:33.119
It all so upsets me, child.

39:33.792 --> 39:35.376
Don't cry, Ma'am.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.526
We'll pull him through.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.126
I swear to you
that we'll pull him through.

39:44.001 --> 39:45.584
Come on, Mr George.

39:48.334 --> 39:49.376
Wait for me.

40:02.834 --> 40:06.376
Come on, Mr George...
it's time for a dip.

40:21.376 --> 40:23.834
That's great, Mr George!

40:24.042 --> 40:25.876
That's great, Mr George...

40:26.042 --> 40:28.584
I think you're better
than you were yesterday.

40:37.042 --> 40:38.751
I'll get the port.

40:51.501 --> 40:53.751
Is everything alright, my child?

40:53.917 --> 40:55.251
Yes, Ma'am.

40:55.417 --> 40:58.667
M. George had a nice swim today.
Now it's time for his port.

40:58.834 --> 41:00.084
I realised that.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.959
I realised it when I saw you.

41:03.126 --> 41:05.876
George is getting some colour back,
thanks to you.

41:06.042 --> 41:10.137
You must never leave us, my child.
Never ever!

41:23.626 --> 41:24.667
Thanks.

41:32.042 --> 41:33.959
Célestine, wait a minute.

41:36.501 --> 41:38.501
But you should be resting,
Mr George.

41:38.667 --> 41:39.917
That's the rule.

41:41.209 --> 41:45.667
I can rest with you for a bit...
that won't hurt.

41:47.792 --> 41:49.709
So come closer, my pet.

42:00.334 --> 42:03.667
Would you read me some more
from "The Orientals".

42:05.209 --> 42:06.876
I like that collection...

42:07.542 --> 42:09.209
That's one of my favourites.

42:18.334 --> 42:20.334
"I love on a bed of moss

42:20.501 --> 42:22.334
"To sing a Spanish air

42:22.501 --> 42:24.459
"While my sweet companions

42:24.626 --> 42:26.542
"Feet grazing the ground

42:26.709 --> 42:28.292
"Nomadic throng

42:28.459 --> 42:29.959
"With generous smiles

42:30.126 --> 42:31.792
"Dance and whirl

42:31.959 --> 42:33.676
"Beneath an open parasol"

42:34.001 --> 42:35.451
Your voice is soft.

42:37.459 --> 42:39.334
"But mostly when a breeze

42:39.501 --> 42:41.126
"Lightly touches my cheek

42:41.292 --> 42:43.084
"I love to sit at night

42:43.251 --> 42:45.001
"Sit and dream

42:45.167 --> 42:47.001
"Gazing on the deep sea

42:47.167 --> 42:49.209

42:49.376 --> 42:51.126

42:51.292 --> 42:52.876
"Its silver fan.

43:35.584 --> 43:37.376
That piece's dead boring!

43:37.542 --> 43:39.209
I thought it was nice.

43:41.709 --> 43:43.834
What are you doing now, Mr George?

43:44.001 --> 43:45.501
I'll draw.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.876
Célestine, come over here.

44:08.042 --> 44:09.292
I can't do it.

44:10.251 --> 44:11.751
I don't feel so good.

44:13.334 --> 44:15.751
My hand shakes...
I don't know what it is.

44:16.626 --> 44:19.001
You too...
I can't really get you.

44:19.167 --> 44:20.792
You can't keep still.

44:25.917 --> 44:27.751
The weird light irritates me.

44:28.751 --> 44:30.334
The sea here is horrible.

44:31.834 --> 44:33.709
Everything's horrible today.

44:34.834 --> 44:36.592
I don't want to see anything.

44:37.167 --> 44:38.667
I only want to see you.

44:39.334 --> 44:42.542
You're not being sensible,
Mr George.

44:43.751 --> 44:47.829
If your grandmother saw you,
she'd be in tears.

44:49.792 --> 44:53.626
Besides, why do you
call me "Mister George"?

44:54.459 --> 44:57.376
I can't call you "Mister Gaston".

44:57.542 --> 44:59.042
Call me "George".

44:59.667 --> 45:00.709
Naughty girl!

45:01.667 --> 45:05.167
I can't do that...
I never will.

45:05.334 --> 45:06.792
Strange...

45:07.584 --> 45:10.501
Does it means you'll always just be
a little slave.

45:18.501 --> 45:19.751
Give me your hand.

45:23.501 --> 45:25.126
You have such pretty hands.

45:25.959 --> 45:27.667
You have such pretty eyes.

45:28.167 --> 45:30.417
You really are pretty all over!

45:34.542 --> 45:36.084
Please stay close to me!

45:36.709 --> 45:39.459
It makes me feel so good
when you're close to me!

45:42.084 --> 45:45.917
- Does that make you feel bad?
- Yes, Mr George, very bad.

45:46.876 --> 45:49.376
What if your grandmother
were to come in?

45:49.542 --> 45:51.376
No, she won't.

45:52.042 --> 45:53.001
Come here.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.917
You've nothing to fear.

45:59.751 --> 46:01.001
Mr George...

46:09.042 --> 46:10.292
See what happens...

46:10.959 --> 46:13.084
Exciting yourself makes you sick.

46:14.459 --> 46:18.251
You don't want to listen...
But it will all start again..

46:19.126 --> 46:20.917
Please be sensible.

46:25.001 --> 46:26.584
You're quite right.

46:27.417 --> 46:28.709
I apologise.

46:31.459 --> 46:35.459
I was crazy to imagine for a moment
that you could love me.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.126
Why would you love me?

46:39.251 --> 46:41.209
Loving you was making me better.

46:45.042 --> 46:47.209
You're right not to love me.

46:47.376 --> 46:48.626
You see me as sick.

46:50.376 --> 46:52.626
You're fearful I might infect you.

46:54.417 --> 46:55.859
That's understandable.

46:57.417 --> 46:59.834
Don't talk like that, Mr George.

47:00.001 --> 47:03.042
It's awful... wicked to say that.

47:04.167 --> 47:06.459
And it hurts me very much.

47:07.876 --> 47:09.126
It's horrible.

47:09.876 --> 47:11.126
Horrible.

47:11.292 --> 47:15.084
I've long awaited the kiss of yours
that will restore my life.

47:33.334 --> 47:37.209
Stay there... you naughty boy!...
See how fearful I am?!

47:38.126 --> 47:39.676
See... you naughty boy!

48:24.084 --> 48:26.001
Well... I'll be going.

48:26.542 --> 48:27.834
No...

48:28.001 --> 48:31.283
I beg of you... stay, my child.

48:34.876 --> 48:36.167
I'm sorry, ma'am.

49:00.667 --> 49:03.667
So life returned to me...
with its ups and downs...

49:03.876 --> 49:05.626
...with new faces...

49:05.834 --> 49:08.651
...with liaisons that finished
as they started...

49:09.042 --> 49:13.084
...swinging between opulent houses
and being out on the street.

49:20.751 --> 49:25.501
- You watch out for that girl.
- Me? Well, here's an idea.

49:25.667 --> 49:28.102
Cute, but where will get it?

49:28.192 --> 49:29.661
A slut like that...

49:29.751 --> 49:32.501
...a girl who may have
some dirty disease.

49:32.667 --> 49:34.584
True... I still have it.

49:34.751 --> 49:38.459
Don't I know what you get up to...
what you like?

49:39.334 --> 49:43.292
All those muddy backsides
you go through in the country.

49:43.501 --> 49:45.959
Honestly!
But there's an idea.

49:46.126 --> 49:49.876
- But where will you get it?
- Little Jézureau... 15 years old.

49:51.084 --> 49:52.792
I had to pay 500 F.

49:52.859 --> 49:54.351
We're waiting for you.

49:54.417 --> 49:57.959
Otherwise you'd be in prison,
like your thief of father.

50:02.334 --> 50:04.301
The filth of decadent people.

50:05.334 --> 50:08.751
-Those republicans have to be
brought down. -For sure.

50:09.792 --> 50:12.209
Jew vermin swarming everywhere.

50:13.501 --> 50:14.876
Me, I'm a Frenchman.

50:16.001 --> 50:18.334
- I stick up for my country.
- And how!

50:19.751 --> 50:22.001
I never go out
without a heavy stick.

50:22.209 --> 50:25.251
Everybody should do the same.

50:29.084 --> 50:33.209
If I was in Paris
I'd burn down those Yids.

50:34.876 --> 50:36.376
Well, I don't know...

50:36.542 --> 50:39.709
...I've no reason
to be against the Jews.

50:40.209 --> 50:42.584
I worked for them at one time.

50:43.459 --> 50:46.251
It's simply that the Jews
are a dirty race.

50:47.084 --> 50:50.042
Is it really any dirtier
than any other?

50:50.209 --> 50:53.001
Jews and Catholics
are all the same.

50:53.167 --> 50:55.167
They're all just as depraved.

50:55.334 --> 50:59.126
The difference in religion
means nothing.

50:59.334 --> 51:01.959
The Jews must be massacred... 
disembowelled!

51:02.126 --> 51:05.167
Let them die
with their guts hanging out!

51:06.376 --> 51:08.251
It's the only solution.

51:30.792 --> 51:32.626
He's quite a man, that Mr Joseph.

51:39.834 --> 51:42.042
So you come from Caen,
Marianne?

51:42.876 --> 51:43.917
Yes

51:46.667 --> 51:50.501
I started as a maid
for a tobacco merchant.

51:52.376 --> 51:55.126
Right away he was on to me.

51:58.959 --> 52:01.459
A skinny guy...

52:02.584 --> 52:05.042
...scraggy, fair-haired...

52:07.167 --> 52:08.626
...blue eyes...

52:09.959 --> 52:11.751
...with a pointy beard...

52:12.417 --> 52:14.042
...that was short and silky.

52:15.626 --> 52:17.126
So silky...

52:17.292 --> 52:18.751
You fell for him!

52:18.917 --> 52:22.459
I lost my virginity at 12
to a hairy old man...

52:22.626 --> 52:24.209
...who stank to high heaven.

52:24.376 --> 52:26.042
He had me after mass...

52:26.667 --> 52:30.209
...in a hiding place under a cliff...
in exchange for an orange...

52:30.376 --> 52:32.209
But I didn't want it.

52:35.542 --> 52:37.501
So what was it like there, Marianne?

52:39.334 --> 52:41.292
Well, I fell pregnant.

52:41.626 --> 52:45.334
The tobacconist's wife kicked me out.

52:47.626 --> 52:51.626
There I was, so young, out on the street
with a kid in my belly.

52:53.376 --> 52:55.376
My boyfriend had nothing.

53:00.626 --> 53:04.167
He found me this funny job
at the School of Medicine.

53:04.334 --> 53:05.676
What sort of job?

53:06.459 --> 53:07.709
My God...

53:08.834 --> 53:12.209
I had to kill the rabbits
and little guinea pigs.

53:12.376 --> 53:13.501
Nice, eh?!

53:15.501 --> 53:17.626
So what did you do about the kid?

53:22.001 --> 53:24.751
What could I have done about it?

53:26.417 --> 53:28.917
Same as the little guinea pigs?

53:31.459 --> 53:32.709
That's right.

53:53.401 --> 53:55.101
See you tomorrow, Célestine.

53:55.167 --> 53:56.751
Yes, tomorrow, Marianne.

56:48.751 --> 56:51.417
There may be beggars
who'd be interested in that.

56:51.584 --> 56:54.584
Try to obtain subscriptions.
Go all over...

56:54.792 --> 56:56.501
...even where Republicans live.

56:56.667 --> 56:59.084
If you score one,
that's where it'll be.

57:16.001 --> 57:17.376
What's that about?

57:20.709 --> 57:23.501
Distributing pamphlets against the Jews.

57:24.251 --> 57:27.876
I have an arrangement
with those goodly priests.

57:30.542 --> 57:32.251
But then, they're my ideas.

57:33.751 --> 57:35.367
And they're well-rewarded.

57:38.126 --> 57:41.251
I'm telling you this,
because I trust you.

57:41.417 --> 57:42.709
It's just between us.

57:43.626 --> 57:45.167
Understood?

57:45.334 --> 57:46.584
Yes, of course.

57:49.959 --> 57:53.459
It's good you came here tonight.

57:54.084 --> 57:56.834
It's nice... I feel flattered.

57:58.917 --> 58:02.334
You left right after dinner.

58:02.501 --> 58:06.084
We didn't even have time
for a bit of a chat.

58:08.042 --> 58:10.626
- Can I help you with your seeds?
- No.

58:10.792 --> 58:12.042
It's no trouble.

58:15.001 --> 58:17.334
I need to talk to you, Célestine.

58:19.751 --> 58:21.542
Now, I feel I know you.

58:22.792 --> 58:24.542
I really like you.

58:27.667 --> 58:30.001
You have to admit
you've taken your time...

58:30.167 --> 58:33.001
Why have you been
so disagreeable towards me?

58:33.567 --> 58:35.226
You always pushed me aside.

58:35.292 --> 58:38.042
You can never tell
about people at first...

58:39.751 --> 58:41.167
Especially women.

58:42.459 --> 58:45.292
It's the devil of a job
to understand a women.

58:45.459 --> 58:47.542
Plus... you came from Paris.

58:48.417 --> 58:52.335
Since you know me now,
tell me how I am.

58:54.001 --> 58:55.259
You're like me.

58:56.417 --> 58:58.334
- Me... like you?
- Yes.

58:59.876 --> 59:03.292
I like you very much...
and I have money to boot.

59:04.209 --> 59:07.542
You don't work 40 years
in good houses...

59:07.709 --> 59:09.792
...without saving a bit.

59:09.959 --> 59:11.209
Of course.

59:12.834 --> 59:15.126
Do you have a lot of money?

59:15.292 --> 59:16.834
A lot? No.

59:17.001 --> 59:19.084
How much? Show me.

59:19.251 --> 59:21.126
It's not here, Célestine.

59:22.292 --> 59:23.584
Well, how much?

59:25.709 --> 59:28.709
Maybe 15,000 fr... maybe more.

59:29.667 --> 59:32.501
Gosh, you HAVE been clever.

59:34.917 --> 59:36.459
That's Rose, coming home.

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:04.001
I'm from Cherbourg.

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:08.751
I know of a good opportunity
in Cherbourg.

01:00:08.917 --> 01:00:12.584
A small café near the port...
really great location.

01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:17.584
Cherbourg's an unrefined sort of town.

01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:19.792
People are cheerful, mischievous.

01:00:19.959 --> 01:00:22.501
There's army and navy.

01:00:23.376 --> 01:00:26.001
They get drunk for no reason.
They love sex.

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:28.334
They spend a lot on sex.

01:00:30.334 --> 01:00:31.801
The only thing is...

01:00:35.292 --> 01:00:37.584
...it would need a woman in it.

01:00:37.651 --> 01:00:39.226
A woman who can manage...

01:00:39.316 --> 01:00:43.417
...well-presented, and who's not afraid
of customers who misbehave.

01:00:44.459 --> 01:00:45.501
Me?

01:00:46.167 --> 01:00:48.042
Would that suit you, Célestine?

01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:52.959
What about you?
Where do you fit into this business?

01:00:53.126 --> 01:00:54.626
With you, dammit!

01:00:55.126 --> 01:00:56.834
And we'd be married...

01:00:57.834 --> 01:00:59.709
...in true friendship.

01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:03.209
Would you expect me to make money
for you as a whore?

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:11.251
I dream of you, Célestine.

01:01:13.209 --> 01:01:15.459
I dream of you in that little café.

01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:38.917
Here's Miss Célestine.

01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:48.251
Is she obedient?

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:52.459
She knows how to behave, presents well.
And she sews.

01:01:55.042 --> 01:01:56.501
Are you married?

01:01:57.251 --> 01:01:58.292
No.

01:02:00.042 --> 01:02:01.384
Are you, Ma'am?

01:02:02.167 --> 01:02:04.709
Of course.

01:02:05.251 --> 01:02:08.459
- Do you have children?
- Certainly.

01:02:08.626 --> 01:02:09.667
Dogs?

01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:11.709
Yes.

01:02:11.917 --> 01:02:13.994
Are your maids required to stay up?

01:02:14.084 --> 01:02:17.334
If I go out in the evening...
of course.

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:19.942
Do you go out frequently
in the evening?

01:02:23.984 --> 01:02:26.176
I'm not interested in this position.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:29.959
I don't work in houses like yours, Ma'am.

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:34.376
Good-for-nothing girls
who don't like to work.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:36.042
Stuck-up bitch!

01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:53.001
Child!

01:02:53.209 --> 01:02:54.876
Child.

01:02:58.251 --> 01:03:00.334
All of Paris parades through my house.

01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:02.251
Famous generals...

01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:05.709
...leading judges,
foreign ambassadors...

01:03:07.626 --> 01:03:09.417
And if i were to tell you...

01:03:09.626 --> 01:03:13.626
...that the French President himself...

01:03:13.834 --> 01:03:15.959
Yes, my girl!

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:19.042
That will give you an idea
what my house is like.

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:22.417
If you would like...

01:03:23.792 --> 01:03:26.501
Think how you'd succeed...
What do you say?

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:29.334
I've not had sufficient education
in love-making.

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:31.751
I'm quite sure you have!

01:03:32.359 --> 01:03:33.601
What do you say?

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:37.001
My lingerie doesn't fit in
with your place.

01:03:37.067 --> 01:03:38.717
If that's all it is...

01:03:38.826 --> 01:03:42.334
...you've nothing to worry about.

01:03:42.542 --> 01:03:45.084
Because at my place
it's all about...

01:03:45.251 --> 01:03:46.709
...most of all...

01:03:46.917 --> 01:03:49.126
...the beauty of nature.

01:03:49.334 --> 01:03:52.001
A nice pair of stockings, nothing more.

01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:53.751
Yes... I know what you mean.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.167
So listen to me...

01:03:55.376 --> 01:03:57.667
Sign up for a 3-month engagement...

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:02.472
...and I'll give you the best
and sexiest outfit there is.

01:04:02.668 --> 01:04:04.131
Let me think about it.

01:04:04.221 --> 01:04:06.876
That's alright...
Think about it.

01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:10.084
I'll give you my address.

01:04:12.084 --> 01:04:14.126
And when you feel it's right...

01:04:14.334 --> 01:04:16.512
...just come.

01:04:17.542 --> 01:04:20.001
So, goodbye for NOW.

01:05:09.292 --> 01:05:12.667
Célestine!
Where IS that girl again?

01:05:17.126 --> 01:05:19.876
It's cleaning-silver day...
had you forgotten?

01:05:25.442 --> 01:05:26.892
Watch out, Célestine.

01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:29.667
My Louis XVI cruet...
It's very rare.

01:05:33.751 --> 01:05:35.084
You're unbelievable!

01:05:35.251 --> 01:05:37.709
How could anyone be so clumsy?

01:05:39.084 --> 01:05:41.626
- What did you say, Joseph?
- Nothing, Ma'am.

01:05:50.709 --> 01:05:54.084
Where's Madeleine?
I didn't see her last Sunday.

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:55.626
Madeleine?

01:05:56.251 --> 01:05:57.959
It's nothing, my dear.

01:06:00.459 --> 01:06:01.709
It's nothing.

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:11.209
- You mean she's sick?
- Yes, she's sick.

01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:15.042
But in 2 days it will have disappeared!

01:06:15.751 --> 01:06:17.667
Mrs Gouin does abortions.

01:06:18.417 --> 01:06:21.626
Did you see what they found
in the woods?

01:06:21.792 --> 01:06:22.876
It was awful!

01:06:22.942 --> 01:06:24.267
A dreadful crime.

01:06:24.334 --> 01:06:26.709
Little Claire, who'd been brutally raped.

01:06:26.876 --> 01:06:28.917
It must have been
some sort of monster.

01:06:29.126 --> 01:06:30.292
Definitely.

01:06:30.459 --> 01:06:34.626
The little girl was maybe a bit simple,
but she was so sweet!

01:06:34.792 --> 01:06:36.251
She was only 11!

01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:38.917
- The roadmender's daughter.
- Poor man...

01:06:39.084 --> 01:06:41.917
Her stomach had been sliced open...

01:06:42.084 --> 01:06:44.709
...with the intestines falling out.

01:06:45.542 --> 01:06:48.417
And her privates...
her poor little privates...

01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:50.792
...just a horrible swollen wound.

01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:54.876
It happened 8 days ago...
That's what Mr Roux told me.

01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:57.709
They can tell from the body.

01:06:57.876 --> 01:07:00.459
It's nearly decomposed.

01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:03.709
She used to spend all her time
in the woods.

01:07:03.917 --> 01:07:06.626
She picked daffodils
and lilies-of-the-valley...

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:08.584
...and made bouquets.

01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:12.459
She looked for morels,
that she sold at the market.

01:07:12.626 --> 01:07:15.001
In summer it was mushrooms.

01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:18.500
But at this time,
there's nothing to pick.

01:07:19.334 --> 01:07:22.751
Her father didn't seem to worry...
Maybe it was him.

01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:25.876
If it was him, why take her
into the woods?

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:28.001
- That's true.
- For sure.

01:07:28.167 --> 01:07:29.751
It's all very suspicious.

01:07:29.917 --> 01:07:33.042
I don't want to make
any assertions, but...

01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:34.376
But what?

01:07:34.542 --> 01:07:36.917
It wouldn't surprise me if it was...

01:07:37.084 --> 01:07:39.626
Mr Lanlaire, if you want to know
what I think!

01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:42.167
It's true he's a bad one.

01:07:42.334 --> 01:07:44.251
He acts like a criminal.

01:07:44.417 --> 01:07:47.917
He wouldn't be capable...
he's be too frightened.

01:07:48.084 --> 01:07:50.584
"Incapable"?!
What about little Jézureau?

01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:53.167
The kid at Valentin?
Little Dougère?

01:07:53.234 --> 01:07:54.601
That's different.

01:07:54.667 --> 01:07:57.651
We know that he's still having sex
with consenting minors.

01:07:59.334 --> 01:08:02.417
But that he'd kill them?
That's scarcely credible.

01:08:02.584 --> 01:08:04.917
Well, I'm saying that it IS!

01:08:06.209 --> 01:08:09.626
Goodness me!...
We can never know the facts.

01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:11.209
Mrs Gouin is right.

01:08:15.376 --> 01:08:18.417
- I think it may be Fournier.
- Do you?

01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:20.792
He'd enjoy it.

01:08:20.959 --> 01:08:22.292
What about Boulet?

01:08:22.501 --> 01:08:26.126
Well, I still say it's Mr Lanlaire.

01:08:31.126 --> 01:08:33.459
Hello, Miss Rose...
How's the captain?

01:08:33.626 --> 01:08:36.001
Hale and hearty, thank you.

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:38.251
You go home.

01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:59.584
Did you know that little Claire was found,
raped and murdered in the woods?

01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:05.584
Someone told me about it
this morning.

01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:08.667
Does anyone know who did it?

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:12.084
Sure to have been some Yid.

01:09:17.584 --> 01:09:19.126
What about my proposal?

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:21.292
Have you thought about it?

01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:48.792
Here's the wood for this morning.

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:50.709
Thanks.

01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:58.352
If you'd like me to mend your things,
I can do it...

01:09:58.442 --> 01:10:00.600
I wouldn't mind.

01:10:03.376 --> 01:10:07.126
What day was it you were in the woods
looking for some soil?

01:10:07.334 --> 01:10:09.042
Do you remember?

01:10:09.209 --> 01:10:10.209
No.

01:10:10.417 --> 01:10:11.917
Why do you ask?

01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:13.334
Just wondering.

01:10:14.334 --> 01:10:16.876
I think it must have been Saturday.

01:10:17.084 --> 01:10:20.153
The Saturday Claire's body was found.

01:10:22.126 --> 01:10:23.667
Possibly... yes.

01:10:24.417 --> 01:10:26.751
It WAS that Saturday.

01:10:27.751 --> 01:10:31.209
That doesn't mean I was there
when she was killed.

01:10:31.276 --> 01:10:34.176
They say that criminals return
to the scene of their crime.

01:10:34.266 --> 01:10:35.917
Who says that?

01:10:37.292 --> 01:10:39.501
I've read it in novels
and magazines.

01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:42.542
You'd do better
to think of something else.

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:45.376
Maybe I was wrong about you.

01:11:19.167 --> 01:11:20.751
What's up, Marianne?

01:11:25.792 --> 01:11:27.334
Madame is getting worked up.

01:11:33.876 --> 01:11:35.501
What is it, Marianne?

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:40.501
I'm frightened I may be pregnant.

01:11:41.751 --> 01:11:43.751
I do think I'm pregnant.

01:11:45.084 --> 01:11:47.167
Are you sure that's what it is?

01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:50.042
Not positive.

01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:53.417
I'm just frightened.

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:56.584
Who would've made you pregnant?

01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:58.251
The master.

01:12:00.167 --> 01:12:01.834
He's just the limit!

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.209
I haven't dared try stop him...

01:12:06.334 --> 01:12:09.876
It's so hard here...
and he kept coming back.

01:12:11.667 --> 01:12:16.150
He can seem nice and affectionate.

01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:18.542
He's just a swine, isn't he, Marianne?

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:19.959
Yes.

01:12:21.251 --> 01:12:23.234
But still handsome and everything.

01:12:25.209 --> 01:12:27.542
- Are you satisfied, at least?
- Yes.

01:12:29.084 --> 01:12:30.626
I'm quite satisfied.

01:12:31.251 --> 01:12:32.459
That's to say...

01:12:33.209 --> 01:12:36.876
I'd be satisfied if I was sure
I wasn't pregnant.

01:12:39.626 --> 01:12:43.959
Don't worry about it.
How late are you?

01:12:45.959 --> 01:12:49.167
One or two weeks,
I'm not quite sure.

01:12:49.334 --> 01:12:52.584
It'll be alright.
Once, I was 2 months late.

01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:56.334
I wasn't pregnant.
You don't have to be.

01:12:58.126 --> 01:12:59.709
It doesn't matter.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:02.792
Tomorrow I'll go see the milliner.

01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:05.292
Listen to me carefully...

01:13:05.459 --> 01:13:08.292
It would be awful
if his wife caught you.

01:13:08.459 --> 01:13:10.084
There's no danger of that.

01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:12.667
He only comes when she's out.

01:13:12.834 --> 01:13:16.251
He doesn't stay...
As soon as he's satisfied, he leaves.

01:13:17.417 --> 01:13:21.501
So what do you want I should do?
If she caught us...

01:13:24.084 --> 01:13:26.626
She's kick you out.

01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:28.042
That's right.

01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:30.459
Yeah.

01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:36.376
- Is he gentle with you?
- He's certainly gentle.

01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:41.209
Does he say sweet things to you?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.084
What does he say?

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:45.542
He comes in...

01:13:46.792 --> 01:13:48.651
He throws himself on me...

01:13:49.084 --> 01:13:50.501
then he pants...

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.501
He pants.

01:13:54.376 --> 01:13:55.959
So cute.

01:14:04.209 --> 01:14:05.959
Come on, Marianne...

01:14:06.126 --> 01:14:08.001
You have to go down now.

01:14:43.542 --> 01:14:44.834
Poor Rose...

01:14:47.042 --> 01:14:49.459
The captain did the right thing.

01:14:51.626 --> 01:14:53.542
What if we went anyway?

01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:56.917
Not worth it...
She's be down on us.

01:14:57.376 --> 01:14:59.834
<i>The air is pure,
the road is wide...</i>

01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:03.584
<i>The bugle sounds the charge...</i>

01:15:09.626 --> 01:15:12.626
<i>The Zouaves go singing...</i>

01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:16.792
<i>And high on the hill...</i>

01:15:18.751 --> 01:15:20.667
<i>The Prussians await them.</i>

01:15:25.334 --> 01:15:27.209
<i>The bugler is an old warrior...</i>

01:15:27.376 --> 01:15:30.834
<i>And when the fight is serious...
He's a tough companion</i>

01:15:33.917 --> 01:15:36.126
How happy I am to see you!

01:15:36.334 --> 01:15:38.542
A great pity, Captain.

01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:40.959
- A great pity for you.
- Yes.

01:15:41.126 --> 01:15:43.792
- Poor Rose.
- I cannot remain alone.

01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:46.917
You won't replace her easily.

01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:49.592
Everything can be replaced!

01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:52.751
She knew you so well...
what you liked...

01:15:52.917 --> 01:15:55.501
- She was devoted to you.
- Really?

01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:59.376
I have to tell you...
I'd had enough of Rose.

01:15:59.542 --> 01:16:02.084
She was useless around the house.

01:16:02.251 --> 01:16:06.959
I couldn't even get a boiled egg
cooked to my liking.

01:16:07.167 --> 01:16:08.251
I see.

01:16:08.417 --> 01:16:12.463
Even if I had a chat with you,
she'd get jealous!

01:16:13.209 --> 01:16:16.292
After all, I'm in my own home, dammit!

01:16:16.501 --> 01:16:18.542
You're being unjust.

01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:21.459
It's good that she died.

01:16:21.667 --> 01:16:24.584
I'll tell you something...
If I'd died before her...

01:16:24.751 --> 01:16:27.459
Rose would have been really caught out.

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:31.459
I was keeping something from her
she would've found very bitter...

01:16:31.626 --> 01:16:33.292
...I can assure you.

01:16:33.459 --> 01:16:36.667
I'd made a will in which
I gave her everything...

01:16:36.834 --> 01:16:39.167
...house, money, annuities... everything.

01:16:39.334 --> 01:16:41.459
She must have told you.

01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:43.626
I was certainly aware of it.

01:16:43.792 --> 01:16:46.459
Yes, but what she didn't know...

01:16:46.626 --> 01:16:48.959
...was that I'd made a 2nd will...

01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:52.126
...which cancelled the first one,
and where I gave her nothing.

01:16:52.334 --> 01:16:53.542
Dammit!

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.265
Wasn't that something!?

01:16:55.784 --> 01:16:57.805
So, what are you doing now, Captain?

01:16:59.126 --> 01:17:01.417
Well now...
That depends on you.

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.126
On me?

01:17:03.334 --> 01:17:04.751
Yes, on you.

01:17:04.959 --> 01:17:06.209
In what way?

01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:08.132
In a nutshell...

01:17:08.222 --> 01:17:11.042
Would you take Rose's place?

01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:13.334
And the wills, Captain?

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:14.917
I'll tear them up.

01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:18.876
- I don't cook.
- I'll cook for myself.

01:17:19.084 --> 01:17:20.751
Il y a cuisine et cuisine.

01:17:20.917 --> 01:17:23.167
The things I want from you...

01:17:23.376 --> 01:17:25.709
...I'm sure you're very good at.

01:17:25.876 --> 01:17:27.584
You're a little swine!

01:17:27.751 --> 01:17:29.459
Not little... a big one!

01:17:30.959 --> 01:17:33.251
So then, Célestine?
35 fr a month...

01:17:33.417 --> 01:17:37.584
...full board including the master's
bedroom... How does that sound?

01:17:37.792 --> 01:17:42.459
We'll see a bit later... In the meantime,
find yourself another fuck.

01:17:42.667 --> 01:17:44.792
He's believe anything, that dummy.

01:18:01.584 --> 01:18:04.792
It'll need to be repainted
and done up like new...

01:18:04.959 --> 01:18:06.417
...so it looks great.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.126
With a new sign.

01:18:11.459 --> 01:18:13.292
"The Military Post".

01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:18.121
The thing is though...

01:18:18.211 --> 01:18:21.459
...I can't quit here just yet.
- Why's that?

01:18:21.626 --> 01:18:23.251
Because.

01:18:23.417 --> 01:18:24.876
Not now.

01:18:25.042 --> 01:18:27.501
So when would you quit for good?

01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:29.917
Maybe not for 6 months.

01:18:30.084 --> 01:18:32.501
Maybe sooner...
maybe later.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:34.292
- It depends.
- On what?

01:18:35.459 --> 01:18:37.459
- On some business.
- What business?

01:18:37.626 --> 01:18:38.876
Some business.

01:18:46.626 --> 01:18:49.459
With you gone, I couldn't stand it
here any more.

01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:53.001
I've become too used to you now.

01:18:56.667 --> 01:19:00.459
Would it mean anything to you
that we never saw each other again?

01:19:00.667 --> 01:19:02.667
You can't make a woman do something.

01:19:02.834 --> 01:19:04.417
Make her do what?

01:19:06.251 --> 01:19:09.334
You always think badly about me.

01:19:10.126 --> 01:19:12.501
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's true.

01:19:13.376 --> 01:19:15.876
It's you who have something else in mind.

01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:17.751
I haven't said no to anything.

01:19:17.817 --> 01:19:19.684
I've just being thinking it through.

01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:23.359
- You don't get engaged without thinking
about it. - We'll talk about it.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:25.501
How long are you going for?

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:27.251
6 days.

01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:31.792
I dream about you, Célestine.

01:19:31.959 --> 01:19:33.876
Me too... I dream about you.

01:19:34.084 --> 01:19:37.792
We have to get it together...
Now!

01:19:38.459 --> 01:19:39.709
Joseph.

01:20:56.342 --> 01:20:59.185
The Jew: Vermin of the world.
How they are overrunning France

01:21:00.078 --> 01:21:02.944
The 12 Apostles of Dreyfus.

01:22:38.001 --> 01:22:39.042
Come on.

01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:09.584
Oui...

01:24:10.292 --> 01:24:12.209
Oui...

01:24:17.967 --> 01:24:19.929
When I give the alarm...

01:24:21.384 --> 01:24:23.651
...you come down with the mistress.

01:24:24.501 --> 01:24:25.959
You'll say nothing.

01:24:26.126 --> 01:24:28.876
You won't speak.
Not one word.

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:34.256
When everything seems alright, I'll go.

01:24:35.526 --> 01:24:37.059
Every night at 11...

01:24:37.126 --> 01:24:39.459
...you'll be watching at the window.

01:24:39.626 --> 01:24:44.209
And if you see a light shining,
the next day, you'll resign.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:49.876
And you'll come and meet me at 11pm...

01:24:50.301 --> 01:24:52.426
...at the entrance to the little wood.

01:24:57.917 --> 01:24:58.959
Ma'am!

01:24:59.834 --> 01:25:01.084
Ma'am!

01:25:02.501 --> 01:25:03.751
Ma'am!

01:25:03.917 --> 01:25:05.792
Ma'am, there's been a robbery!

01:25:05.959 --> 01:25:07.001
Ma'am!

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:08.626
Sir!

01:25:08.834 --> 01:25:11.084
What's wrong?

01:25:18.042 --> 01:25:19.917
You've been robbed, ma'am.

01:25:20.401 --> 01:25:22.434
- What's been taken?
- Everything!

01:25:22.501 --> 01:25:24.526
- Everything, Ma'am.
- Dear God!

01:25:24.876 --> 01:25:27.167
- What's been stolen?
- Wait.

01:25:27.334 --> 01:25:28.609
Oh, my God!

01:25:35.376 --> 01:25:36.917
Bloody hell!

01:25:45.917 --> 01:25:47.917
Oh, my God!

01:25:48.084 --> 01:25:49.959
Oh, my God!

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:56.959
My silver!

01:25:57.167 --> 01:25:58.751
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:25:59.459 --> 01:26:01.584
My silver!

01:26:09.626 --> 01:26:11.792
Come now, darling, calm down.

01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:15.084
They've taken it all!
All! All! All!

01:26:16.376 --> 01:26:20.209
- Even the Louis XVI cruet!
- Oh, bloody hell!

01:26:20.376 --> 01:26:22.251
What about the dogs!

01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:26.001
What use are they
if they don't bark when they have to?

01:26:26.167 --> 01:26:28.167
Come now, darling, calm down.

01:26:29.501 --> 01:26:31.334
What are you doing here?

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:36.126
Standing there stupidly
with your thick puffy face?

01:27:15.042 --> 01:27:17.917
You don't suspect any of your staff?

01:27:18.084 --> 01:27:19.376
Your coachman?

01:27:19.542 --> 01:27:22.626
Joseph? A man who's been devoted to us...

01:27:22.792 --> 01:27:24.751
He's been with us 15 years.

01:27:24.959 --> 01:27:26.667
He is a pillar of honesty.

01:27:26.834 --> 01:27:29.626
A pearl.
He'd go through fire for us.

01:27:34.209 --> 01:27:36.126
Days, months passed.

01:27:36.792 --> 01:27:39.626
The investigators were unable
to discover anything.

01:27:39.792 --> 01:27:42.709
They abandoned the case indefinitely.

01:27:42.876 --> 01:27:47.459
They said it must have been done
by a gang from Paris.

01:27:47.626 --> 01:27:49.334
Paris is easy to blame.

01:27:54.084 --> 01:27:57.751
- I'm just too tired, ma'am.
- But it can't be possible.

01:27:57.917 --> 01:28:01.042
But it is possible.
I need to rest.

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:02.451
You talk to him.

01:28:03.626 --> 01:28:05.417
Look now, Joseph...

01:28:09.376 --> 01:28:12.042
You will leave with our best wishes,
Joseph.

01:28:12.209 --> 01:28:13.459
Thank you Ma'am.

01:28:14.084 --> 01:28:15.417
Thank you, sir.

01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:57.084
I told myself that I'd
become a pearl, too.

01:28:57.251 --> 01:29:01.292
I did and said everything
to win her favour.

01:29:01.459 --> 01:29:03.009
She began to soften up.

01:29:03.834 --> 01:29:07.167
Bit by bit she actually became my friend.

01:29:58.751 --> 01:30:02.001
He's a nice boy who's been
waiting for me for a long time.

01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:04.201
Can't you just stay a little longer?

01:30:04.309 --> 01:30:07.917
He's waiting for me, ma'am.
I must return to Brittany.

01:30:08.084 --> 01:30:09.709
I'll raise your wages...

01:30:09.917 --> 01:30:12.292
...and you'll have a room
on the 1st floor.

01:30:13.792 --> 01:30:16.209
I have no choice, ma'am.

01:30:17.792 --> 01:30:20.167
I've become so used to you.

01:30:20.334 --> 01:30:22.667
It's just my bad luck.

01:30:45.501 --> 01:30:47.334
Off we go.

01:30:48.692 --> 01:30:51.942
Joseph is holding on to me...
He takes me like a man possessed.

01:30:52.009 --> 01:30:53.792
And I'm happy with him.

01:30:53.959 --> 01:30:57.542
I'll do anything he wants me to...

01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:59.584
...even commit crime.
