A NETFLIX SERIES

00:12.000 --> 00:15.208
-Slow down, man! Slow down!
-Hey, that's right back in it!

00:15.291 --> 00:16.541
What the fuck is this shit?

00:24.208 --> 00:26.083
Yeah, take that, asshole!

00:26.166 --> 00:27.333
KO!

00:27.416 --> 00:28.625
-Oh!
-Knockout!

00:44.041 --> 00:44.916
Hey, guys!

00:58.625 --> 01:01.291
-Who are you? What are you doing?
-Where's the coke?

01:01.375 --> 01:02.250
We don't have it.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.333
Where is the coke?

01:03.416 --> 01:05.291
We don't have anymore!
Just let her go.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.666
Some guys up the street stole it.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.875
You get it, man?
Those guys from the streets took it.

01:08.958 --> 01:10.791
We don't have the coke.
They robbed us.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.500
What the hell is going on?

01:35.375 --> 01:36.958
-This car works?
-Keys in the RV.

01:37.041 --> 01:38.583
Get them, come on! Run!

01:38.666 --> 01:40.166
Who the hell are you, anyway?

01:40.250 --> 01:42.541
Shaïnez is my niece.
They kidnapped her.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.833
-Where are you going?
-Open the door.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.250
-Hurry, hurry, hurry!
-Get in! Get in!

01:49.333 --> 01:51.000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:52.666 --> 01:54.000
-Give me the keys.
-Here.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.458
Fuck, it's them!

01:57.041 --> 01:59.083
Those motherfuckers!

02:00.083 --> 02:01.791
That's the guys who stole the coke!

02:01.875 --> 02:04.125
-They're over there!
-Let's go! Come on!

02:04.208 --> 02:07.208
Fuck! I said drive! Let's go!

02:07.291 --> 02:09.916
-What are you doing? Liana!
-She's opening the door!

03:06.875 --> 03:07.708
Fuck!

04:00.125 --> 04:01.833
Know what he's doing?

04:01.916 --> 04:02.916
What?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.333
He sank the boat.

04:04.958 --> 04:07.166
Cargo scattered
between Tangiers and Casablanca.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.166
Son of a bitch!

04:09.250 --> 04:12.166
He's not the only son of a bitch.
His parents are too.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.083
The cargo was dumped in the sea.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.958
People pulled it out with ropes.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.041
Really?

04:17.125 --> 04:18.875
I swear it's true.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.541
I'll be right back.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.625
It was him. He's a traitor.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.416
How are you, my dear?

05:03.500 --> 05:04.541
It's Saber.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.500
He's gotten worse, Ba.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.791
What has he done this time?

05:10.375 --> 05:11.666
He's working with idiots.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.958
Guys who flatter him and do stupid things.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.708
What do you mean "stupid things"?

05:17.375 --> 05:20.041
He's been dealing coke in Antwerp
near Chris's territory.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.041
I don't know what to do.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.791
He won't even answer my calls.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.416
Go see him at his garage.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.708
And if you see him there,
tell him to call me.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.666
Tell him his father wants to talk to him.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.250
I really am sorry, Ba.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.166
No, no, I'm the one who's sorry.

05:38.833 --> 05:42.791
I thank God for giving me
such a devoted niece, in fact.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.333
I have to go.

05:44.416 --> 05:46.000
I miss you, sweetheart.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.333
I miss you so much.

05:47.916 --> 05:49.083
Me too. I miss you too.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.125
Was that your uncle on the phone?

06:07.458 --> 06:09.250
I just heard, "I miss you."

06:12.208 --> 06:13.708
Yes, it was my uncle.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.250
And when do I get to meet him?

06:16.333 --> 06:17.291
When we're married.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
And, uh, when are we getting married?

06:25.791 --> 06:26.625
Never.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.083
Which apartment is it?

06:43.708 --> 06:46.333
-Third floor, door on the right.
-What are you going to do?

06:46.416 --> 06:48.958
Get the coke before your friends
show up, and get Shaïnez.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.875
And what if you're lying? How am I
supposed to believe you won't screw us?

06:53.208 --> 06:55.041
Believe whatever you want.
I don't give a fuck.

06:59.916 --> 07:01.666
I'm coming with you. Fuck that.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.750
Get her some water.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.083
Where is he?

08:12.291 --> 08:13.750
What's down below?

08:13.833 --> 08:16.458
Weapons. Just some handguns.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.583
Have you lost your mind?
You can't keep those here.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.375
Hey, don't forget who brings the money in.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.625
You just handle the books
and the accounts.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.166
Call him back.

08:30.916 --> 08:32.083
He's waiting.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.416
Who is?

08:33.500 --> 08:34.791
Your father.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.083
What's he want?

08:38.083 --> 08:41.208
Probably to discuss the coke
you've been selling on Chris's turf,

08:41.291 --> 08:42.916
but I could be wrong.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.250
I just do the books.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.958
Did you handle Saber?

08:56.041 --> 08:58.041
And what about the favor I asked of you?

08:58.791 --> 09:00.208
I told you I'm on top of it.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.333
I just need to check with my lawyer.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.291
After I do,
you're going to need to do me a favor.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.208
You will disappear from my life.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.916
Once we're inside,
keep quiet and don't do anything, okay?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.500
Okay, but what's your plan?

09:18.416 --> 09:19.250
You need to tell me.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.250
We break in, grab the coke, and we run.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.166
That's your plan?

10:24.875 --> 10:25.875
What is it?

10:26.541 --> 10:27.708
It's a deadbolt.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.708
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting us in.

10:39.375 --> 10:42.958
-Who is it?
-Hello? I live upstairs with my aunt.

10:43.041 --> 10:45.833
-What does the bitch want?
-Don't talk about her like that!

10:45.916 --> 10:47.583
What does your bitch aunt want?

10:47.666 --> 10:49.666
Hey listen, bitch.
My aunt's working. Got that?

10:49.750 --> 10:52.208
She's had enough
of your fucking noisy shit.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.166
It's been an hour.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.083
-She sent you?
-I told you, my aunt has work stuff.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.333
Just sit down. Sit down.

11:02.416 --> 11:03.250
Shh!

11:06.375 --> 11:07.750
Anyone here, huh?

11:26.416 --> 11:27.958
Why are you making that face?

12:11.333 --> 12:12.583
Bring me a bag.

12:22.416 --> 12:24.458
-Hey, you.
-Hello.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.125
-You good?
-Yeah.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.416
I'm going to borrow your bag
for a minute, all right?

12:29.500 --> 12:30.666
-Okay.
-Thanks.

12:33.208 --> 12:34.041
Here.

12:34.625 --> 12:36.166
-Is that it?
-Yeah, that's it.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.416
Oh, fuck!

12:45.541 --> 12:46.708
Go see what it is.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.583
Sabrina!

12:53.666 --> 12:55.458
Sabrina, open up!

12:55.541 --> 12:57.666
Dammit.

13:00.541 --> 13:03.000
Yo, Sabrina, let me in!

13:03.083 --> 13:04.291
Oh fuck.

13:07.041 --> 13:08.541
Goddammit, Sabrina!

13:11.083 --> 13:12.125
Sabrina, open up!

13:14.791 --> 13:15.708
Who is it?

13:16.583 --> 13:17.541
Who the fuck are you?

13:17.625 --> 13:18.750
Where's Sabrina?

13:21.416 --> 13:23.666
Uh, I'm her cousin. Sabrina's not here.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.000
She went out for groceries,
so I'm with the kid.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.166
Just open the door. Come on.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.500
I'm not supposed to, so…

13:29.000 --> 13:31.666
Listen to me, bitch. Don't fuck with me.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.291
Open the door now, or you're dead.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.041
Hey, you know what? Fuck you!

13:36.125 --> 13:38.666
What did you say?

13:38.750 --> 13:40.375
Open the fucking door, bitch!

13:40.458 --> 13:43.000
-Mama?
-I swear to God, get the fuck out…

13:43.083 --> 13:44.416
Mama…

13:44.500 --> 13:46.625
You got that?
I don't care who you are.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.791
Open the fucking door!

14:02.125 --> 14:03.458
What the hell you doing, asshole?

14:03.541 --> 14:04.958
Put your guns down.

14:05.041 --> 14:06.875
Fuck. All right, take it easy.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.458
Put your guns down. Guns down.

14:10.041 --> 14:12.125
You too. Put your guns down.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.625
Now go up the stairs.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.250
Come on, let's go.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.291
Up the stairs.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.541
Up the stairs. You too. Come on, let's go.

14:21.625 --> 14:23.333
Come on, let's go! Higher!

14:23.416 --> 14:25.791
Keep going! Come on, come on!

14:25.875 --> 14:27.041
My baby!

14:27.791 --> 14:29.416
My baby!

14:35.916 --> 14:37.666
-Come on, let's go!
-He's here!

14:37.750 --> 14:40.458
Get out of the way!
Move, move! Watch out!

14:41.416 --> 14:43.708
He's going down!
He's over here!

14:43.791 --> 14:45.208
I'm going around!

14:46.208 --> 14:47.666
He's over here!

14:47.750 --> 14:48.875
Take the kid!

14:54.583 --> 14:55.916
Shit, shit! Hang on!

14:58.666 --> 15:00.333
Hang on tight!

15:25.708 --> 15:27.958
You're dead, motherfucker!

15:45.041 --> 15:47.250
You're a maniac, a fucking maniac!
You got that?

15:47.333 --> 15:48.166
Enough.

15:49.375 --> 15:50.708
I just want to get my niece back.

15:50.791 --> 15:52.500
And me, what do you think I'm doing here?

15:54.125 --> 15:55.958
That kid was our ticket out of there.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.625
We'll get her back.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.625
We've got the coke now.
We'll get her back.

16:17.708 --> 16:21.583
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

16:42.250 --> 16:44.250
Okay, great. Thank you.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.791
Hello, Sofia. What can I do for you?

16:50.875 --> 16:53.375
Yes, hello, Virgil. Is Thierry there?

16:53.458 --> 16:56.583
-No, he's in court today. But I'm sure--
-It's regarding Chris de Wit.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.791
Everything I'm about to tell you now
needs to remain between us.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.958
Um, you can count on me. Of course.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.708
Auntie!

17:14.791 --> 17:16.416
Happy birthday!

17:16.500 --> 17:18.250
-What do you say?
-Thank you.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.375
Ah! I've been waiting for you for hours.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.958
Don't exaggerate.
Hasn't even been half an hour.

17:27.416 --> 17:28.666
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.500
Hey, what's that?

17:37.583 --> 17:38.583
A gift from Saber.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.083
-Milhan wanted a piano?
-No.

17:44.166 --> 17:47.416
But his father saw on YouTube
that the king's son was learning to play.

17:50.541 --> 17:51.416
Well…

17:52.541 --> 17:54.666
At least music encourages creativity.

17:55.875 --> 17:56.833
Help me with this…

17:58.541 --> 17:59.708
instead of bullshitting.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.708
Are you gonna put it in the pool?

18:09.791 --> 18:11.291
-Are you really?
-Yeah, why not?

18:48.666 --> 18:50.666
Ah. Hello, Mr. Djebli.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.375
Is Thierry here?

18:52.458 --> 18:55.333
Uh, no, sorry.
Mr. Decarne is in court today.

18:55.416 --> 18:57.791
-Would you like to leave a message?
-No!

18:59.083 --> 19:00.833
It's all right, Isabelle. I've got this.

19:00.916 --> 19:01.791
Fine.

19:02.666 --> 19:03.833
Come on.

19:06.541 --> 19:09.416
Sorry, I should have been clear
in my message. Actually, I wanted to talk.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.875
Let's slip in here. It'll be quieter.

19:21.083 --> 19:21.916
Here.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.458
-What's your name again?
-Uh, Virgil.

19:32.291 --> 19:34.083
What can I do for you, Virgil?

19:35.333 --> 19:37.625
I know that your cousin Sofia

19:38.291 --> 19:39.958
handles your family's money.

19:40.041 --> 19:43.916
And to be honest, her previous
financial plans have been brilliant.

19:44.833 --> 19:45.791
And so?

19:47.083 --> 19:48.708
It would be a shame to

19:48.791 --> 19:52.625
let other professionals benefit
off her unique financial specialty.

19:52.708 --> 19:54.041
Who would benefit from it?

19:56.125 --> 19:58.583
Well, your cousin, uh, wants to help…

20:00.666 --> 20:01.708
…Chris de Wit…

20:02.916 --> 20:04.958
so that he can manage his money better.

20:06.458 --> 20:10.458
And she wants me to give some legal advice
on her proposed financial moves.

20:11.166 --> 20:14.208
-She speak with Thierry or just with you?
-Just me.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.208
-And for now, Mr. Decarne doesn't know.
-Okay.

20:17.291 --> 20:20.125
So… I wanted to speak to you about it.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.333
It stays between us.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.541
But keep my father out of it.

20:31.958 --> 20:33.375
Can I ask you something?

20:34.666 --> 20:35.500
Yes.

20:36.416 --> 20:37.666
What are you after?

20:40.125 --> 20:40.958
Nothing.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.416
It's just, eventually,
you'll replace your dad.

20:47.458 --> 20:48.500
And I…

20:49.333 --> 20:51.333
could take over for my boss.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.125
So, yeah.

20:53.916 --> 20:56.041
I thought until then,
we could get to know each other.

21:13.541 --> 21:16.000
Milhan, tell your auntie about the dog.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.500
My mom said yes, we could get one.

21:18.583 --> 21:19.875
Oh, really?

21:22.458 --> 21:24.125
-Is there a battle in here?
-Yeah.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.291
-Yeah? Are you the winner?
-Yeah.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.125
-Kiss. You doing okay?
-Mm-hmm.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.750
We're good.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.125
Hey, Dad?

21:35.625 --> 21:37.291
-You coming?
-One sec, I'll be right there.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.250
Okay?

21:39.208 --> 21:40.041
Go on.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.583
Did you call your father
like he asked?

21:48.458 --> 21:49.458
Not yet.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.541
I saw Chris.

21:54.916 --> 21:57.250
And how is he doing?

22:02.041 --> 22:04.375
Do you know how humiliating it was
to be there?

22:04.958 --> 22:07.708
To let that asshole act
like he's doing me a favor?

22:08.291 --> 22:11.708
And why did he forgive me? Hm?

22:12.375 --> 22:13.583
He runs Antwerp.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.750
If you ever go there again…

22:16.833 --> 22:19.166
Look, I know that he asked you
to do his books.

22:19.958 --> 22:21.375
And I know that you accepted.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.708
I'm just giving advice.

22:27.416 --> 22:30.541
-That's all this is, okay?
-Then why not tell my dad?

22:30.625 --> 22:33.250
Hey! Don't try to pretend this is on me.

22:33.833 --> 22:37.125
-You're the reason we're in this mess--
-That's enough, all right?

22:37.916 --> 22:39.875
You didn't tell my father
because you're afraid.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.208
Think what you want.

22:46.166 --> 22:49.333
But if I had told him about
the first time you sold coke in Antwerp,

22:49.416 --> 22:51.625
you'd be selling sandwiches in Casablanca
right now.

22:51.708 --> 22:52.583
You know what?

22:53.166 --> 22:54.458
Keep your little pact with Chris.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.000
But I'm going to take his product.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.833
So all the cash you get him
will end up with me.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.125
You have nothing to prove, Saber.

23:16.416 --> 23:18.000
You have nothing to prove.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.625
May I ask you something?

23:51.708 --> 23:53.041
Do you ever miss Brussels?

23:54.250 --> 23:55.083
No.

23:55.916 --> 23:57.250
And if you ever did,

23:57.916 --> 23:59.083
would you tell me?

24:01.208 --> 24:02.041
No.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.750
I'm really sorry.

24:12.875 --> 24:14.250
Sorry about what?

24:15.125 --> 24:17.708
For having you be just a bodyguard.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.666
It's more calm than what I'm used to,
but it's okay.

24:22.583 --> 24:23.916
I'm adapting.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.000
How are you, sweetheart?

24:36.875 --> 24:39.708
I hate to bring bad news,
but we have a problem with Saber.

24:40.291 --> 24:41.833
What has he done now?

24:42.625 --> 24:44.208
He wants to go after Chris.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.333
He's going to hijack a shipment of coke.

24:46.416 --> 24:48.125
Are you sure that he will do it?

24:48.958 --> 24:50.000
He told me himself.

24:50.666 --> 24:53.166
Don't worry. Leave Saber to me.

24:54.541 --> 24:56.083
I'm sorry about this.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.583
I love you, sweetheart.

25:09.916 --> 25:10.958
Call my lawyer.

25:12.958 --> 25:14.750
We're going to Brussels.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.416
Yes.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.875
I found what they need.

25:24.916 --> 25:26.125
I got the eight keys.

25:26.208 --> 25:27.333
Waiting for a meeting point.

25:27.958 --> 25:29.666
I'll get her back. Don't worry.

25:29.750 --> 25:32.041
Try to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.083
Thank you.

25:41.666 --> 25:42.875
Get the dope.

25:46.416 --> 25:47.375
Here.

25:53.458 --> 25:54.708
For our fingerprints, right?

25:59.541 --> 26:00.833
You do this a lot?

26:15.833 --> 26:17.000
What do we do now?

26:20.583 --> 26:21.666
Where are you going?

26:23.416 --> 26:24.625
Hey, I'm talking to you.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.458
I'm keeping my eyes on you, man.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.875
Don't move. Look straight ahead.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.791
I got the info on your uncle.

26:45.708 --> 26:46.958
Impressive body of work.

26:50.708 --> 26:51.916
Drink.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.333
I said look straight ahead.

26:59.250 --> 27:03.083
You and your friends stealing my coke
is the best thing that could've happened.

27:09.916 --> 27:11.333
24-HOUR SERVICE

27:20.208 --> 27:21.583
What do we do now?

27:22.375 --> 27:23.333
We wait.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.958
Why do you do it?

27:32.041 --> 27:34.041
Pretend to be escorts?

27:35.250 --> 27:37.000
Because we want to get out of here.

27:38.000 --> 27:38.916
That's all.

27:40.666 --> 27:42.083
Go somewhere sunny.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.375
We need cash for that.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.250
And fast.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.541
Got a problem with sunshine?

27:52.166 --> 27:54.375
When you robbed that man,
did you know he would have coke?

27:54.958 --> 27:56.125
No, we didn't know about it.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.875
Whose decision was it to keep the coke?

28:00.625 --> 28:01.458
It was mine.

28:04.166 --> 28:05.666
Shaïnez had nothing to do with it.

28:06.291 --> 28:07.750
It's my fault they took her.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.333
How long have you been together?

28:16.541 --> 28:17.458
Nine months.

28:21.833 --> 28:22.791
You love her?

28:23.875 --> 28:26.166
Shaïnez is my whole life.
That's why I'm here.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.583
Look, we all make mistakes.

28:30.958 --> 28:33.083
The important thing
is not to do it again.

28:36.125 --> 28:38.250
My name's Liana.

28:40.541 --> 28:41.375
What's yours?

28:46.166 --> 28:47.208
Mehdi.

28:50.166 --> 28:51.583
Nice to meet you, Mehdi.

29:54.166 --> 29:55.375
You okay?

30:05.416 --> 30:07.000
Your message had me worried.

30:08.333 --> 30:09.666
Why did you want to see me?

30:11.375 --> 30:13.000
Do I need a reason to see you?

30:14.041 --> 30:14.875
What?

30:15.375 --> 30:17.166
Do I need a reason to see you?

30:25.458 --> 30:26.791
Just take me.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.625
How long was I out for?

31:00.625 --> 31:01.666
All night.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.083
Okay.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.208
I need to use the restroom.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.125
Hey!

31:42.916 --> 31:43.916
Are you kidding me?

31:45.041 --> 31:47.041
I'm gone two seconds, and you bounce?

31:47.125 --> 31:48.208
I got their message.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.750
We need to find another car.

31:51.375 --> 31:52.208
Okay.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.666
The crowd is holding its breath.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.750
Looks like he's getting up. He's up…

32:06.375 --> 32:08.750
We need your car.
And I'll take your fries.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.458
All right, beat it! Let's go.

32:31.208 --> 32:32.375
I love you so much.

32:33.916 --> 32:34.958
I love you too.

32:40.833 --> 32:43.416
You know all those things
I told you about my uncle?

32:45.041 --> 32:47.125
That he raised me when my parents passed.

32:49.166 --> 32:51.333
-Yeah.
-You know him.

32:54.291 --> 32:57.208
You got him ten years in prison
for drug trafficking.

33:01.666 --> 33:03.000
What do you mean?

33:07.291 --> 33:09.166
My uncle is Hassan Djebli.

33:13.083 --> 33:15.166
We didn't meet by accident, Antoine.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.291
So what are you saying?

33:22.458 --> 33:25.083
You and I met
because I wanted information on the case.

33:25.166 --> 33:28.041
I wanted to know what you had on him
before his trial.

33:32.458 --> 33:33.333
Antoine.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.625
Tell me you're joking, Sofia.

33:37.375 --> 33:39.041
Tell me it's a fucking joke.

33:48.625 --> 33:49.916
Who the hell are you?

33:51.375 --> 33:53.250
How did you find the details, anyway?

33:54.250 --> 33:57.500
-You search my computer? My phone?
-I'm in love with you, Antoine.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.333
No…

34:26.250 --> 34:27.250
This is it.

35:09.125 --> 35:10.208
Let me handle it.

35:35.416 --> 35:37.625
You're the famous uncle,
the heist man, huh?

35:38.208 --> 35:39.041
You armed?

35:39.125 --> 35:40.291
No.

35:44.833 --> 35:45.791
Where is she?

35:47.625 --> 35:50.166
You know the problem with your niece
is her fault.

35:50.791 --> 35:53.125
What matters is that we all work together.

35:53.208 --> 35:56.208
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't have gotten your coke back.

35:56.291 --> 35:58.583
-Where's my product?
-First bring me my niece.

35:58.666 --> 36:00.875
Hey, that's not how this works.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.625
You get her after we're done.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.125
Where's the coke?

36:06.625 --> 36:07.583
Down in the car.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.666
On the back seat.

36:28.125 --> 36:31.291
Got a crew? Work alone?

36:31.375 --> 36:32.541
Answer me.

36:47.208 --> 36:48.958
We're good. It's all there.

36:55.166 --> 36:56.125
Where is she?

36:57.833 --> 36:58.791
She's right there.

37:18.541 --> 37:19.791
Liana!

37:25.125 --> 37:27.291
What do you think you're doing?
Where you going?

37:30.458 --> 37:32.125
Shaïnez! Damn it!

37:55.250 --> 37:57.166
Tell them to bring her back!

37:58.833 --> 38:00.666
Can you shut her up, please?

38:01.250 --> 38:02.375
What do you want?

38:03.875 --> 38:06.750
You're pretty clever, huh?
I'm a fan of clever men.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.958
Enough. Look, just tell me what you want.

38:09.041 --> 38:11.166
Three hundred keys of coke
will be arriving

38:11.250 --> 38:13.375
in the Antwerp port tomorrow.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.500
You'll bring it all to me.

38:30.291 --> 38:32.000
Come on. Come on. Come on.

38:42.750 --> 38:46.333
You son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!

38:48.625 --> 38:50.583
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

38:57.458 --> 39:00.625
Let go of me.
