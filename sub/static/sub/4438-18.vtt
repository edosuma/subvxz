WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:05.465
( Maniacal laughter)
Oh, it's happening!

00:05.672 --> 00:07.549
It's finally,
finally happening.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.351
( Iaughil19 )

00:09.551 --> 00:12.430
Physical form?
Don't mind if I do!

00:16.099 --> 00:17.942
Oh! What just happened?

00:18.769 --> 00:21.363
Oh! Oh, man.
This is bad.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.820
This is real bad.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.244
Guys, we've got
a situation.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.538
(all exclaiming )

00:33.742 --> 00:35.415
( laughter )

00:36.411 --> 00:38.834
All right, listen up,
you one-life-spanned,

00:39.039 --> 00:39.881
three-dimensional,

00:40.082 --> 00:41.299
five-sensed
skin puppets.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.298
For a trillion years,
I've been trapped

00:43.502 --> 00:44.879
in my own decaying
dimension,

00:45.087 --> 00:47.340
waiting for a new universe
to call my own.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.721
Name's Bill, but you
can call me

00:49.925 --> 00:52.678
your new lord and master
for all eternity.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.357
Now meet the gang of
interdimensional criminals

00:57.558 --> 01:00.437
and nightmares
I call my friends.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.146
8 Ball,
Kryptos,

01:03.355 --> 01:05.449
The Being Whose Name
Must Never Be Said.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.068
Ah, what the heck.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.619
It's Zanthar.
Then of course,

01:08.819 --> 01:10.321
there's also Teeth,
Keyhole, Hectorgon,

01:10.529 --> 01:12.873
Amorphous Shape,
Aronica Pacifier and these guys.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.956
This is our town
now, boys.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.958
Now see here,
you unholy triangle fella.

01:22.165 --> 01:26.511
As mayor, I strongly urge you
to get on outta here.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.885
Yeah. Things with
one eye are weird.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.511
We don't like
out-of-towners.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.094
We punch what
we don't understand.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.721
I would just like to say
that as a rich capitalist,

01:35.929 --> 01:37.522
I welcome your
tyrannical rule.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.225
Perhaps I can be
one of your, uh,

01:39.433 --> 01:40.901
horsemen of
the apocalypse.

01:41.101 --> 01:41.772
Dad!

01:41.977 --> 01:43.854
Not now, sweetie.
The grownups are talking.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.447
Oh, wow,
that's a great offer.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.233
How about instead,
I shuffle the functions

01:47.441 --> 01:49.159
of every hole
in your face?

01:52.738 --> 01:55.366
( Evil laughter )

01:55.574 --> 02:00.045
Durland!
My precious Deputy Durland!

02:00.203 --> 02:02.626
It's time we do
a little redecorating.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.550
I could really use
a castle of some kind.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.640
And how about some bubbles
of pure madness?

02:13.175 --> 02:14.392
( Screaming )

02:14.593 --> 02:16.186
This party never stops.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.185
Time is dead,
and meaning has no meaning.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.057
Existence
is upside down,

02:21.266 --> 02:23.268
and I reign supreme.

02:23.477 --> 02:27.027
Welcome, one and all,
to Weirdmageddon.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.947
( Shrieking )

03:09.898 --> 03:11.195
So this is how
the world ends.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.653
Not with a bang,
but with a... cuckoo.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.488
- Weirdmageddon.
- ( both screaming )

03:20.033 --> 03:21.455
Move it, stretch!

03:21.660 --> 03:23.913
Hey, we're
scampering here.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.373
The rift is shattered.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.797
Bill's world
is spilling into ours.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.376
Every minute,
his powers grow stronger.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.133
Mabel... the rift must have
cracked inside her backpack.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.385
She must be in danger.
I have to go find her.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.761
Mabel. Come in, Mabel.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.593
Mabel!

03:37.759 --> 03:39.386
Dipper, listen to me.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.470
We can find
your sister soon,

03:40.679 --> 03:42.306
but first, we have
to stop Bill.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.562
If we can blast him back
through the rip he came out of,

03:44.766 --> 03:46.359
we just might
be able to stop him

03:46.560 --> 03:48.858
before his weirdness
spreads across the entire globe.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.531
Are you sure defeating Bill
is even possible?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.200
No, I'm not sure.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.323
But being a hero
means fighting back

03:55.527 --> 03:57.245
even when it seems
impossible.

03:57.446 --> 04:00.290
- Will you follow me?
- To the ends of the earth.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.663
Good, because
that's where we're heading.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.166
You also might
want to step inside.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.755
Weirdness wave!

04:16.798 --> 04:18.721
Ah! Abuelita,
a tidal wave of madness

04:18.925 --> 04:20.346
just went over us.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.350
Oh, Soos,
such an imagination.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.726
Ah!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.227
You turned into
a chair!

04:25.432 --> 04:27.230
Why don't you have
a seat and relax?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.402
What about you,
and my friends?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.947
I'll be fine.
You go help the others.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.987
When the universe
is broken,

04:34.191 --> 04:36.410
only one handyman
can fix it.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.113
I'm coming for you,
friends.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.868
Time for a nap.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.284
Hey!

04:44.493 --> 04:45.540
That's it, goat.

04:45.744 --> 04:49.089
It's time I threw you
off this property for good!

04:53.251 --> 04:55.470
On second thought,
I'm gonna run like a coward now.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.514
( Loud bleating )

05:02.511 --> 05:04.354
Freedom, freedom!

05:05.764 --> 05:06.686
Okay, inmates,

05:06.890 --> 05:08.142
it's time to review
your finger paintings.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.312
Good. Nice.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.114
Gideon, does this look like
someone who's ready

05:14.356 --> 05:15.608
to re-enter society?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.284
Gideon's unappreciated
in his time.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.828
Oh, Ghost Eyes,
you're making me blush.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.030
Gideon makes prison
life worth living.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.286
ALL: Gideon, Gideon...

05:23.490 --> 05:24.491
- ( loud rumbling )
- ( all gasping )

05:24.699 --> 05:27.202
( bleating )

05:37.212 --> 05:39.306
( raucous screech )

05:39.506 --> 05:41.884
0h, my,
Bill came through.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.561
BILL: Ready to cause
some havoc, boys?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.858
Ah, my quantum
destabilizer.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.531
Been waiting a long time
to use this.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.655
We're only gonna have
one chance to take this shot.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.322
Steady. Steady.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.412
And...

06:07.576 --> 06:08.372
( goofy laughter )

06:08.577 --> 06:09.920
I'm alive now.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.423
Oh, no!

06:17.377 --> 06:19.300
Well, well, well.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.132
And here I thought today
couldn't get any better.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.229
Great-uncle Ford!

06:28.430 --> 06:30.524
Dipper, take my journals.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.153
Listen. I know of
one other way to defeat Bill.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.525
It's...

06:36.730 --> 06:38.903
Oh, no, Dipper, run!
Get down!

06:39.107 --> 06:40.529
Good old Six Fingers.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.532
I've been waiting
an eternity

06:42.736 --> 06:46.536
- to have a chat face to face.
- ( yells )

06:46.740 --> 06:49.619
Everyone, this Armageddon
wouldn't be possible

06:49.826 --> 06:51.294
without help from
our friend here.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.292
Give him
a six-fingered hand.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.715
This brainiac is the one
who built the portal

06:55.916 --> 06:57.589
in the first place.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.715
Don't look
so sour, Fordsie.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.388
It's not too late
to join me.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.181
With that extra finger,

07:03.381 --> 07:05.475
you'd fit right in
with my freaks.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.769
I'll die before
I join you.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.812
I know your weakness, Bill.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.606
Oh, yeah?
And I know a riddle.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.400
- Why did the old man do this?
- This?

07:19.397 --> 07:22.116
Because I needed
a new back scratcher.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.536
( laughter )

07:26.988 --> 07:28.365
That's enough!

07:28.573 --> 07:31.417
Hand over my uncle,
or else!

07:31.618 --> 07:34.212
Now isn't this...

07:34.412 --> 07:36.210
interesting?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.712
My old puppet
is back for an encore.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.885
You think
you can stop me?

07:41.044 --> 07:43.092
Go ahead, Pine Tree,
show me what you got.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.388
I...

07:44.589 --> 07:46.011
Uh...

07:46.216 --> 07:47.889
"I, um, I..."
Do it, kid.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.221
Do some brilliant thing
that takes me down right now.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.805
What do you got,
Pine Tree?

07:52.013 --> 07:53.686
Everyone's waiting.
Do it!

07:53.890 --> 07:55.517
EHTH]

08:03.525 --> 08:06.324
That's right.
Don't be a hero, kid.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.202
This is what happens
to heroes in my world.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.377
No! The journals!

08:14.577 --> 08:16.250
Not much of
a threat now, are you?

08:16.454 --> 08:19.458
Now can anyone remind me
why we came here?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.543
To get weird!

08:21.751 --> 08:24.300
That's right.
VIP party at the Fearamid.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.381
Oh, and <i>8</i> Ball, Teeth,
you've earned a treat.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.806
- Have the kid for a snack.
- Huh?

08:30.301 --> 08:33.100
Hench maniacs,
roll out!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.858
( Bill cackling )

08:47.402 --> 08:49.245
( panting )

08:50.405 --> 08:52.282
So you wanna eat him
or something?

08:52.490 --> 08:54.868
Oh, definitely.
Let's eat him.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.999
( Screaming )

09:02.417 --> 09:03.839
<i>We're day three in
this strange cataclysmic event</i>

09:04.002 --> 09:05.845
<i>which some are calling
Weirdmageddon,</i>

09:06.046 --> 09:07.798
<i>or the Odd-pocalypse.</i>

09:08.006 --> 09:09.599
<i>Weather today calls for
black clouds, blood rain,</i>

09:09.799 --> 09:11.722
<i>and frequent showers
of eyeball bats</i>

09:11.926 --> 09:13.849
<i>turning people
into stone.</i>

09:14.054 --> 09:17.024
<i>I'm Shondra Jiminez,
and I ate a rat for dinner.</i>

09:17.223 --> 09:19.396
Mabel, it's me.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.061
So far,
I've eluded capture,

09:21.269 --> 09:23.988
but I haven't been able
to find you or Stan anywhere.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.657
I don't know if
you can hear me,

09:25.857 --> 09:27.404
but wherever you are,
whatever happens,

09:27.609 --> 09:30.328
- I'm going to find you.
- ( animal shrieking )

09:32.322 --> 09:34.916
The mall! Maybe they're
hiding in there.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.005
- Oh, no.
- Hey. Hey, you.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.962
Hey, I wanna
talk to you.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.343
I wanna talk to you about
going inside my mouth.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.015
I think you wanna
get in here.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.389
Hey, you! Hey,
I'm talkin' to you!

09:53.593 --> 09:55.436
You don't have to make
a big deal outta this.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.230
Hello. Hello!

09:57.430 --> 10:00.354
Why are you
just ignoring me?

10:00.558 --> 10:01.559
That's seriously rude

10:01.768 --> 10:03.770
to just ignore
someone like that.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.486
Stan! Mabel!

10:13.363 --> 10:15.741
Maybe at least I can
get something to eat.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.577
The last nachos
on Earth.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.747
Help! The nachos
tricked me!

10:21.955 --> 10:23.332
Dipper?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.338
Wendy? Oh, no.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.385
You've been transformed into
some sort of tree monster.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.337
It's just camouflage.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.640
My dad made me and my brothers
do apocalypse training

10:31.840 --> 10:33.387
every year instead of
Christmas.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.514
Guess it's sort of cool
their paranoia paid off.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.730
Nice! Bat meat.
Let me get that for you.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.651
Wendy, I'm so glad
to find you.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.980
I thought everyone
I knew was gone.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.609
Hey, hey, it's okay.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.862
We have each other now.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.660
And Toby Determined, who I
accidentally mistook for a monster.

10:52.861 --> 10:56.206
This just in:
This arrow in my shoulder.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.033
We shouldn't stay
out in the open for too long.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.371
Let me show you
my hideout.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.296
We were playing
Truth Or Dare in the cemetery

11:07.500 --> 11:09.127
when it happened.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.429
The eyeballs froze Nate, Lee, Tambry
and Thompson.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.347
( Cash register jingles )

11:13.548 --> 11:15.801
Robbie almost got away,
but had to pause to take a selfie.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.261
What about you?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.562
I was in a fight with
Mabel when it happened.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.519
Uncle Ford asked me
to be his apprentice

11:21.681 --> 11:23.308
after the summer was over.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.484
But that would mean
I wouldn't go back home.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.737
It would mean growing up
without Mabel.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.439
Oh, dude.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.115
Mabel didn't
take it well,

11:31.316 --> 11:32.818
and she ran off
into the forest.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.279
She couldn't even
look me in the eye.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.830
Come on, let's get
some fresh air.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.453
Toby, you watch the camp.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.580
Don't call me Toby
anymore.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.752
Call me Bodacious T.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.963
No one will ever
call you that.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.377
(whining groan )

11:51.336 --> 11:52.679
End of the world.
Man.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.973
Those death metal
album covers

11:55.298 --> 11:56.424
got it shockingly right.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.223
You know, I used to think
I could get out of anything.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.141
But this?
The journals are destroyed,

12:01.346 --> 12:02.393
Ford is captured,

12:02.597 --> 12:04.895
and I can't find
my family anywhere.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.108
Bill said it himself.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.232
There's no room
for heroes out here.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.813
We lost.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.614
Look, dude,
it's not over yet.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.400
You've beaten Bill
twice before.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.360
Why is this time
any different?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.286
'Cause then,
I had Mabel.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.989
Then you need to get
Mabel back.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.370
Look, this summer,
I've seen some amazing things,

12:21.574 --> 12:24.123
but nothing as amazing
as you and your sister.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.829
I don't know if
it's dumb luck,

12:26.037 --> 12:27.630
or yin and yang
or whatever,

12:27.830 --> 12:29.377
but when you two
work together,

12:29.582 --> 12:31.755
there's nothing you two
can't accomplish.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.928
You just need
to make up and team up,

12:34.128 --> 12:35.550
and save the universe.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.007
But how will
I ever find her?

12:37.215 --> 12:38.432
( Loud rumbling )

12:42.303 --> 12:44.977
The shooting star
from Mabel's sweater.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.024
She's in there.
I know it.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.102
Whoa, is that like
twin ESP?

12:49.310 --> 12:50.527
No, we don't have that.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.321
But we do have this thing
where our allergies

12:52.480 --> 12:53.982
totally act up
at the same time.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.407
( Sneezes )

12:55.608 --> 12:57.326
Mabel needs us.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.414
How are we gonna get out there
without being caught?

13:01.614 --> 13:02.991
I have an idea.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.424
( Dance music plays )

13:11.624 --> 13:14.252
Spin that person,
spin that person.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.757
Spin that person.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.305
( Raucous laughter )

13:21.509 --> 13:23.011
Go nuts, GUYS-

13:23.219 --> 13:25.438
When we're done partying,
I unveil phase two.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.515
Open up.
This is the police.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.309
Time police.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.190
Just play it cool.
Ditch the time punch.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.566
Let me do the talking.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.825
Bill Cipher, you are
in violation

13:38.026 --> 13:39.699
of the rules
of Spacetime,

13:39.902 --> 13:41.620
and possessing the body
of a time officer.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.244
My body is a temple.
How dare you?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.167
Hear this, Cipher.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.244
Ugh, Time Baby.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.831
If your rip in this dimension
continues,

13:51.039 --> 13:53.633
it could destroy
the very fabric of existence.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.803
Surrender now
or face my tantrum.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.383
Oh, no, a tantrum.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.306
Whatever will I do
about that?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.474
How about this?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.268
<i>'</i> ( All gasping )
' Aw, snap!

14:08.473 --> 14:10.646
He just killed
Time Baby.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.069
( All cheering )

14:13.269 --> 14:15.317
Oh, man, this has gone
from bad to worse.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.027
I gotta get out of
Time Dodge.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.528
Boss, the pine tree kid got
away before we could eat him.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.364
Are you worried he might
try to cause some trouble?

14:24.572 --> 14:26.540
Yeah, trouble with
Mabel's bubble?

14:26.741 --> 14:28.334
Ha! I'm not worried.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.834
I've got someone
on the case.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.340
The abandoned auto mart.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.888
Free cars,
ripe for the hot wiring.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.262
We have found
our ride to Mabel.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.968
Wonder if they
have a tank.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.928
I always wanted
to drive a tank.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.355
I can't believe
this place is just abandoned.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.523
Oh, an air freshener.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.401
Finally, I'll smell like
a person.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.358
Stealy, stealy. Ah!

14:56.521 --> 14:58.865
Huh, it's gonna take more
than one dart

14:59.065 --> 15:01.159
to keep me...

15:02.527 --> 15:04.245
Oh, no. Tony!

15:04.445 --> 15:07.494
Was it Tony? I can never
remember his name.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.128
Well, well, looks like
we got ourselves

15:13.329 --> 15:14.626
a pair of
ground walkers.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.253
Ha ha, ground walkers.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.334
Ain't got no wheels.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.216
( Raucous laughter )

15:20.420 --> 15:22.172
Listen, discount
auto warriors.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.007
We just wanna make it
to that bubble out east.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.058
We have no quarrel
with you.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.432
Oh, but that's
where you're wrong.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.138
Hands where I can see 'em.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.724
Y'all fellers ain't
goin' nowhere.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.229
Y'all?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.732
Fellers? Wait.
Gideon?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.358
That's Sheriff Gideon.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.239
Under the authority of
Bill Cipher,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.738
I place you two
under arrest.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.786
Hi, Wendy.
Have we formally met?

15:48.823 --> 15:50.746
( Both grunting )

15:50.950 --> 15:52.202
Ooh-wee.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.787
Look who the apocalypse
dragged in.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.417
Y'all are in
a 12-piece bucket

15:55.621 --> 15:57.373
of deep fried
trouble now.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.176
Ghost Eyes, spittoon.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.219
It's Gideon.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.342
And he's gotten
folksier.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.219
My old pal Bill
figured you might try

16:05.423 --> 16:06.845
to rescue Mabel,

16:07.049 --> 16:10.269
so he appointed me
master of these wastelands,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.564
and keeper of the bubble.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.474
My sweet, precious Mabel's
trapped inside,

16:14.640 --> 16:16.813
and I have the only key
wrapped around my...

16:17.018 --> 16:19.271
well, I wouldn't
call it a neck exactly.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.856
Wrapped around this little
pocket of fat under my head.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.282
Gideon, you have no right
to keep her in there.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.819
Bill explained it to me
nice and simple.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.950
She was always
destined to be mine,

16:28.154 --> 16:29.406
and now that I have her
in a cage,

16:29.614 --> 16:30.456
she'll learn to love me.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.079
I have an eternity to wait.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.042
Ghost Eyes, ready to escort
our friends to Bill's dungeon?

16:37.246 --> 16:38.748
NO. Hey!

16:38.956 --> 16:40.208
This isn't gonna
work, Gideon.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.918
Oh? And why's that?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.882
Because after I break
Ghost Eyes' arm,

16:44.086 --> 16:45.759
and steal that key
from your neck,

16:45.922 --> 16:47.674
I'm gonna wear your butt
on my foot

16:47.840 --> 16:50.218
- like a rhinestone slipper.
- ( laughter )

16:50.426 --> 16:52.724
And what makes you think
you can do all that?

16:52.929 --> 16:55.557
'Cause I'm a flippin'
Corduroy!

17:00.520 --> 17:02.522
Ghost Eyes,
my hench angel.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.152
( Screams )

17:05.191 --> 17:06.192
Get back!

17:06.400 --> 17:09.243
Get back, or I will
drop-kick him, I swear.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.664
You'll never
get away with this, you hear me?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.909
Guess what?
We already did.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.213
Wendy, you're
the coolest person I know.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.256
I know, dude.
Tell me about it later.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.011
After them!

17:26.963 --> 17:29.762
- You want your baby seat?
- Yes, please.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.519
We are not letting them
get Mabel.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.472
Discount Auto Mart warriors,
roll out!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.366
Okay, all we have to do
is outrace Gideon's henchmen,

17:47.567 --> 17:50.741
unlock the bubble,
save Mabel, save the world.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.822
Quick question: did you ever get
your driver's license?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.657
Definitely not.
Arm!

18:03.833 --> 18:05.631
I can't let 'em
free Mabel.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.429
Remind me why you're keeping
your girlfriend in a prison bubble again.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.223
Have we, the prisoners,
become the wardens?

18:11.424 --> 18:14.018
She loves me.
She just doesn't know it yet.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.892
- Now quit the philosophy.
- Sorry. It was my major.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.184
Ha! Weirdness bubble
blockin' the path.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.487
Ooh-wee!
We got 'em now.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.405
Watch it. Go around
that bubble field.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.109
No way around.
Hold on! We're goin' through.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.318
What's even in there?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.486
( Both screaming )

18:43.664 --> 18:46.292
( coughing )
That was horrible.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.003
Here comes another one, dude.
Brace yourself!

19:08.481 --> 19:10.324
( Screams )

19:10.483 --> 19:11.735
Wendy, we're
almost there.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.286
We just have
to make that jump.

19:14.445 --> 19:17.198
Total lack of driver's training,
don't fail me now.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.479
So close.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.354
Mabel... I'm...

19:43.557 --> 19:45.525
almost there.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.487
Hey, Dipper.
How's it hangin'?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.739
- Soos!
- Soos?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.071
Handyman of the apocalypse,
at your service.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.246
Soos, how'd you...
where'd you...

19:58.447 --> 20:00.370
I've been wandering
the plains like a desperado,

20:00.574 --> 20:01.996
helping strangers.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.911
I guess there are
some folk songs about me now.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.337
Let me see
what the damage is here.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.666
The good news is,
your arm is okay.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.965
What's the bad news?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.593
Bad news is,
we're surrounded, dudes.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.551
Ooh-wee!

20:14.755 --> 20:16.382
I daresay you almost
had a jump on me

20:16.590 --> 20:17.967
there for a second.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.303
But this ain't
your Gravity Falls anymore.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.854
Out here, I win.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.021
( Blows low note )

20:27.601 --> 20:29.478
Bill's hench bats
will be here any minute

20:29.687 --> 20:32.691
to retrieve y'all.
Mabel's mine now!

20:35.443 --> 20:37.286
Is she?

20:37.445 --> 20:39.447
Well, yeah.
I have her trapped.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.077
Ergo, Mabel is mine.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.662
Gideon, listen to me.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.915
If I've learned
anything this summer,

20:45.119 --> 20:48.123
it's that you can't
force someone to love you.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.298
The best you can do
is strive to be

20:50.499 --> 20:52.627
someone worthy of loving.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.132
Oh, I'm worthy
of lovin'.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.589
These prisoners love me.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.884
But Mabel doesn't,
because you're selfish.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.344
But you can change.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.225
Bill thinks there's
no heroes in this world,

21:03.429 --> 21:05.352
but if we work together
and fight back,

21:05.556 --> 21:06.808
we can defeat him.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.851
You wanna be
Mabel's hero?

21:09.059 --> 21:11.357
Stand up to Bill
and let us save her.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.238
That's crazy.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.066
You know what Bill would do
to me if that happens?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.777
- You scared of Bill?
- No, I...

21:17.985 --> 21:19.783
It's a complicated
situation.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.160
Look inside, Gideon.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.666
If all this
is for Mabel,

21:23.866 --> 21:26.085
then ask yourself what Mabel
would want you to do.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.345
Dipper, will you tell her
what I did?

21:36.545 --> 21:37.637
Of course.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.590
I hope you're right
about this.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.263
Guys, new plan.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.220
Bill's minions are gonna
be on us in seconds.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.021
But I'm not gonna let
that dumb triangle

21:46.222 --> 21:47.394
be the warden of me.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.566
Y'all ready for a good,
old-fashioned prison brawl?

21:49.725 --> 21:51.398
We're behind you
for life, brother.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.937
Fighting children
is boring.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.738
Fighting a chaos god
sounds fun.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.159
Let's do this!
Henchmen, roll out!

22:03.197 --> 22:06.542
Whew! And I thought I was
gonna have to throw down.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.712
Okay. Remember, guys,
this is a prison bubble

22:09.912 --> 22:11.960
designed by Bill.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.625
We've gotta prepare ourselves
for what we find in here.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.256
Whatever it is,
we'll do it together.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.258
- For Mabel.
- For Mabel.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.635
For Mabel.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.442
Anybody wanna
get in my mouth?

22:35.604 --> 22:37.106
I'm a big, hungry monster.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.282
I'm a big, hungry
monster here.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.239
I would really appreciate it
if someone...

22:41.402 --> 22:43.075
You, ma'am,
