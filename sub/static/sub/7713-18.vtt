WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:03.586
Michael,
since it is your fifteenth
anniversary at the company,

00:03.671 --> 00:05.963
l thought it
might be appropriate
to begin the festivities

00:06.048 --> 00:08.966
with a 1 5-minute
round of applause.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.051
l like it.

00:10.135 --> 00:13.221
Followed by a 1 5-minute
moment of silence.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.931
l don't know.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.599
ls it classy enough?

00:16.684 --> 00:19.227
Jim, enough with
the classy, okay?

00:19.311 --> 00:22.188
l just feel like
after 1 5 years
at this company. . .

00:22.272 --> 00:23.314
Bravo, by the way.

00:23.399 --> 00:26.859
That we should celebrate
with a very classy event,
a night to remember.

00:26.944 --> 00:27.944
l think you're right.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.780
This party has to have
all the excitement, drama

00:30.864 --> 00:33.074
and intrigue of my time here.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.701
And, of course, classy.

00:34.785 --> 00:35.952
And classy, yeah.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.705
Michael,
you're just agreeing with him
'cause he's wearing a tux.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.039
Don't you see
what he's doing here?

00:40.124 --> 00:42.583
Last week,
Dwight sent out a memo
about the dress code.

00:42.668 --> 00:46.462
So, this is me showing him
that l'm taking it
very seriously.

00:46.797 --> 00:51.134
Oh ! Here's one.
A string quartet
playing classical music.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.637
(BOTH HlSSlNG)

00:55.806 --> 00:59.809
You know, that's good,
but it's not classy.
l need something

01:00.602 --> 01:03.146
classy, like
the opening of
a car dealership.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.313
That's it.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.773
Or Mr. Peanut.
Yes.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.567
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
He is.

01:07.651 --> 01:09.152
He is a regular peanut.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.446
He just happens to have
a cane, a monocle
and a top hat.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.864
That's what
makes him classy.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.073
DWlGHT: Okay,
how about this?

01:14.158 --> 01:15.742
An ice sculpture
shaped like you

01:15.826 --> 01:18.035
covered in
chocolate-covered
strawberries.

01:18.704 --> 01:21.164
Dwight,
you're trying too hard,
and that's just not classy.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.875
See,
the thing about classy is,
it's a state of mind.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.669
Well, l'm sorry.
l just don't know
what classy is, then.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.421
Okay, let's just try
this one on for size,

01:28.505 --> 01:31.174
and l apologize,
'cause it's right off
the top of my head.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.385
An ice sculpture of you
completely surrounded

01:34.470 --> 01:36.387
by a variety of
chocolate-covered fruits.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.597
Strawberries?

01:37.681 --> 01:38.681
That's inspired.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.932
l said that!

01:41.226 --> 01:42.310
(SLAMMlNG DOOR)

01:43.020 --> 01:44.020
Not classy.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.438
Not classy at all.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.315
DecIasse.
French !

01:48.108 --> 01:49.317
Classy.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.594
Hi, can l help you?

02:16.678 --> 02:19.514
Yeah, l'm Charles Miner,
here to see Michael Scott.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.517
Sure, just one second,
please. Have a seat.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.269
MICHAEL: Yes?
Michael,

02:25.354 --> 02:26.521
there's a Charles Miner
here to see you.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.565
Miner? I hardIy know her!

02:31.735 --> 02:32.693
HeIIo?

02:32.778 --> 02:33.820
Yeah, are you
coming out now?

02:33.904 --> 02:34.904
Uh-huh.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.658
Well, well, well,
who have we here?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.285
lt is Prince
Charles Miner!

02:41.912 --> 02:47.083
At your service.
Everybody, this is
Sir Charles Miner,

02:47.459 --> 02:50.503
and he is the new VP
for the Northeast region,

02:50.587 --> 02:52.672
so just give it up
for this big guy, right?

02:52.756 --> 02:53.840
Give it up!

02:53.924 --> 02:55.007
Here he is.
There he is.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.175
CHARLES: Hey. Hi.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.343
Hi, everyone. . .

02:57.427 --> 02:58.427
Wow! Hold that thought.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.305
You know what?
l want everybody to
go into the break room.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.765
l have a little
surprise for you.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.100
Go ahead. You, too.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.519
Dwight, would you
escort our guest
in there?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.145
Come on.
Here we go.
Don't be shy.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.022
Don't be shy,
you're one of us.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.567
(WHlSPERlNG) Dwight,
stall him a little bit.
l have to get the fish.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.985
Hey.
Yes?

03:15.571 --> 03:17.530
Really wish you would've
told me the new boss
was coming today.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.824
What? No!
l didn't want to make
everybody nervous.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.410
No, l mean
l could've brought
a change of clothes, or. . .

03:22.494 --> 03:23.536
You look dynamite.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.787
What are you
talking about?

03:24.872 --> 03:27.498
Very slick. Okay,
let me get the fish.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.626
Originally founded in 1 866,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.795
Scranton quickly became
one of Pennsylvania's

03:32.880 --> 03:35.381
largest anthracite
coalmining communities.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.009
Surprise!
There's nothing in here.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.261
The real surprise is
in the conference room.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.637
Let's go!

03:41.722 --> 03:43.806
God ! Okay, come on !
Come on !

03:43.891 --> 03:47.560
l'll finish it up later,
but essentially what
we're talking about is. . .

03:48.020 --> 03:49.562
Surprise!

03:50.981 --> 03:53.941
As you can see,
l turned the bagels

03:54.026 --> 03:55.902
from O's into C's,
for Charles.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.155
Thank you.
Took me all night.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.740
This is what you
did last night?

04:00.824 --> 04:02.617
l met this guy at
corporate last week,

04:02.701 --> 04:05.786
and we were just
digging each other's vibe.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.581
I was totaIIy
grooving on him,
and vice versa.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.042
And besides,
the last two people
to have his job

04:11.126 --> 04:12.543
were Jan and Ryan.

04:12.628 --> 04:17.548
The former was my lover,
and the latter my best friend,
so who knows?

04:18.842 --> 04:20.259
l do.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.053
(lN DEEP VOlCE)
lt's gonna be mental !

04:23.847 --> 04:25.848
(ENUNClATlNG)
lt's going to be mental.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.019
Oh, my God, he's like
a black George Clooney.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.021
ANGELA: Really?
l don't see it.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.400
l mean, he's okay.
He's not unattractive,
he's. . .

04:36.526 --> 04:37.610
Hey, how you doing?

04:37.694 --> 04:38.778
l'm Jim Halpert,
from sales.

04:38.862 --> 04:39.987
Hey.
Just wanted to say,

04:40.072 --> 04:42.531
if you need anything,
let me know.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.909
Why are you
wearing a tuxedo?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.119
l didn't think you'd notice.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.914
lt's funny, actually.
There's another
salesman out here,

04:49.998 --> 04:52.667
Dwight Schrute,
he sent out this memo,
as he always does,

04:52.751 --> 04:55.169
and it was about
professionalism
in the workplace,

04:55.253 --> 04:56.963
and of course
he singled me out.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.256
So l just had
to mess with him.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.718
You'd understand if
you read the memo,

05:02.844 --> 05:04.095
which l should
probably get you.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.806
There's probably
one in the drawer.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.391
lt was pretty crazy.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.642
But. . .

05:10.394 --> 05:12.687
Not more crazy than
wearing a tux at work.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.981
l'll grant you that,
so l'm gonna. . .

05:15.065 --> 05:16.732
Your name's Jim?
Jim Halpert, yep,

05:16.817 --> 05:19.735
so just gonna let you
get back to it, so. . .

05:20.612 --> 05:22.446
He just had to
wear his tux today.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.614
l thought l'd be funny.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.075
Took him 40 minutes
to get ready.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.163
All right,
let me introduce you
to some of the troops.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.165
Accounting,
front and center.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.085
Come on up here.
l'd like you
to meet somebody.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.670
This is
the accounting department.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.463
Hey. l come
from accounting, too.

05:39.923 --> 05:40.965
Nerd alert!

05:41.049 --> 05:45.428
This is Oscar Martinez.
He is Latino,

05:45.971 --> 05:50.057
and he just got out
of a long-term relationship
with a man, Gil,

05:50.142 --> 05:53.019
who broke his heart,
but he didn't bring
any of that into work,

05:53.103 --> 05:55.271
it did not affect
his job performance
whatsoever,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.106
and l am very proud of him

05:57.190 --> 05:58.190
for that.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.775
Hey, Oscar,
it's good to meet you. Good.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.487
This little hell-raiser
is Angela.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.741
She has slept with
a bunch of different
guys in the office.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.076
The one over there,
in the orange.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.369
Heyo!

06:10.454 --> 06:11.954
Heyo.
Where's the other. . .

06:12.039 --> 06:14.623
You know, Michael,
l don't need to know
everyone's sexual history.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.918
Well, perfect,
because we have now
arrived at Kevin,

06:18.003 --> 06:19.545
(CHUCKLlNG) and he
has no sexual history.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.671
Hey!

06:20.756 --> 06:22.965
How about l just
say hi to everyone
at one time?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.300
Good ! Good, good, good.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.344
Everyone please give
it up for Charles Miner.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.223
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you for
the C-shaped bagels.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.726
Well. . .
Above and beyond.
Great. That's great.

CHARLES: Hey, you know,
we're in tough times,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.480
and we're not immune
to this economy.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.814
That's true.
But the goal is

06:38.899 --> 06:40.691
to, you know,
fight our way
through this.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.026
(CLEARS THROAT)

Are there going
to be layoffs?

06:44.529 --> 06:45.571
No, absolutely not.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.906
Hold on, Michael,
thank you.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.867
Stanley, you know,
we can't make any promises,

06:49.951 --> 06:52.745
but we'll try
everything in our power
to avoid that.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.121
Do you have specifics?

06:54.206 --> 06:57.458
Well, Michael should have
filled you in last week.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.837
Well, due to the economy,
there's a lot of worry
going around.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.340
l didn't want to
worry people. Well. . .
You didn't tell them.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.549
Why don't. . .

07:05.634 --> 07:06.717
Yeah, what l told Michael. . .

07:06.802 --> 07:08.469
Charles is going
to tell you.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.763
. . .is that we are cutting
3% across the board,

07:10.847 --> 07:12.890
which means we will
no longer be matching

07:12.974 --> 07:14.767
401 (k) contributions,

07:14.851 --> 07:17.186
and all overtime
requests will need

07:17.270 --> 07:19.271
to come through
the corporate office.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.898
Fantastic.
Well, it's not official.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.608
lt is official.
lt is official. . .
Well. . .

07:22.692 --> 07:24.902
And actually, guys,
l'm encouraging branches

07:24.986 --> 07:27.446
to consider a freeze
on discretionary spending.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.949
Such as salary benefits,
etcetera, etcetera. . .

07:30.033 --> 07:31.117
No, no.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.119
. . .insurance.
Not salaries.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.206
Petty cash,
supplies and parties.
Things like that.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.290
Well. . . No.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.583
(WHlSPERlNG)
What about your party?

07:39.668 --> 07:40.793
Okay, okay.
You know what?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.503
l think this has been great.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.964
l think this gives us
a lot to think about,
doesn't it?

07:45.048 --> 07:48.050
Charles Miner,
ladies and gentlemen.
He has a long trip home.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.094
Thank you for coming in.
We have to get back to work!

07:50.178 --> 07:51.554
Michael, l'm going
to stay for the day.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.888
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.557
l've got this covered.
This was just
a meet and greet.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.183
No, this is a little
more involved than that.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.560
l'm gonna set up
in here, okay?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.854
l am thrilled
that the new boss

07:59.938 --> 08:01.856
has taken such
an active interest

in all of
the responsibilities
that l'm supposed to have.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.404
Thrilled.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.907
David,
it was my understanding

08:11.992 --> 08:13.993
that l was not
going to be managed.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.078
DAVID:
What gave you that idea?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.080
lt was my understanding.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.165
I see.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.668
Listen, why don't we just
leave that position vacant?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.587
Truth be told,
l think l thrive

08:24.671 --> 08:26.338

accountability.

anything eIse at aII,
just Iet CharIes know.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.356

coming to my fifteenth
anniversary party?

best shot, Michael.

will that help us with
the year-end tax stuff?

08:58.121 --> 08:59.747
Think he hung up?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.415
No.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.420
l just got off the horn
with David Wallace,
and he said that you and l

09:06.504 --> 09:09.882
should try to get to
know each other better,
and l agree.

09:09.966 --> 09:14.428
So, what l would
like you to do
is tell me something

09:15.472 --> 09:17.056
that you've never
told anybody before.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.349
No.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.976
Come on.
What's your wife's name?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.521
Where did you work
before you came here?

09:24.606 --> 09:26.357
Saticoy Steel.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.650
Beautiful !

09:27.734 --> 09:33.572
See, African-Americans
have such a rich history
of unusual names.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.825
No, l worked at a company
called Saticoy Steel.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.913
You're not from paper?
No.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.748
Does David know this?
Yeah, he knows.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.042
He just wants
a good manager.

09:45.126 --> 09:49.421
Well, that actually is
an excellent segue into,

09:50.257 --> 09:52.258
really,
what is my only point. . .
Yeah, what is that?

09:52.342 --> 09:55.678
. . .and that is,
l don't need to be managed,
Charles.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.515
And if you want to
pick up some tips
observing here

09:59.599 --> 10:01.392
and take them to
the other branches,
it's all good,

10:01.476 --> 10:06.105
but Jan would mostly come by
when she was super horny

10:06.189 --> 10:11.610
and Ryan would come by
to visit his parents
and do laundry, so. . .

10:14.030 --> 10:15.072
Are we clear?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.449
That's not how l plan
on doing things.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.243
Okay, okay.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.911
Well, l'll just
bounce that off David.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.037
See what comes back.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.832
l'll tell David
what he needs to know.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.376
Sorry.
David wants it this way.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.128
Whatever David wants.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.254
Okay.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.631
MlCHAEL: Michael Scott
calling for David.

10:32.716 --> 10:37.386
Well, just tell him
to call me ASAP
as possible. Thanks.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.307
Michael, come on, no.
You have to charm them.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.474
(PHONE RINGING)

10:44.644 --> 10:45.769
STEPHANIE:
David WaIIace's office.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.522
Hey there, gorgeous.
How you doing today?

10:48.606 --> 10:49.648
I'm good, thank you.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.150
How's it hanging?

10:51.234 --> 10:52.276
AII right.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.445
Good, listen.
My name is Michael

10:55.947 --> 10:57.156
Scotch,

10:57.866 --> 10:59.950
and l just wanted to say

11:00.035 --> 11:03.912
that l've got
David Wallace's son
in the trunk of my car.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.081
lf he doesn't
get on this phone
in five seconds,

11:06.166 --> 11:07.333
l'm gonna start. . .

11:07.417 --> 11:08.751
What are you doing? God !

11:08.835 --> 11:10.002
(DIAL TONE)

11:10.086 --> 11:12.629
Oh, my God.

11:12.714 --> 11:13.964
(PHONE RINGING)

11:14.049 --> 11:15.049
STEPHANIE:
David WaIIace's office.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.344
Hi, Stephanie,
it's Michael Scott again.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.095
l just spoke
with Michael Scotch,

11:20.180 --> 11:21.805
and the son's
going to be returned.

11:21.890 --> 11:22.890
Everything's fine.

11:22.974 --> 11:23.974
MichaeI...

11:24.059 --> 11:26.018
And l really, really
need to talk to David.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.478
PIease hoId.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.605
CHARLES: CharIes Miner.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.441
Hello? Hello, who is this?

11:34.861 --> 11:35.861
Who is this?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.571
l was never given a name.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.823
(BOTH SlGHlNG)

11:59.594 --> 12:00.761
Hi, can l help you?

12:00.845 --> 12:01.970
l don't think anyone here. . .

12:02.055 --> 12:05.891
Pam. Hey, everyone,
lunch is on me today.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.310
DWlGHT: Whoa!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.395
Wow! That is so unnecessary.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.647
Are you kidding me
with this?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.107
On the day that
l bring in breakfast?

12:13.191 --> 12:14.483
Hey, man,
it's no big deal.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.445
l wish you had
told us sooner,
because l was going to go

12:18.530 --> 12:20.155
to the vending machine
and get an egg salad.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.366
You still have
that option.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.535
Thanks again, Charles.
You're welcome.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.577
Thank you.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.789
Nobody thanked me
for breakfast
except Charles.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.333
(SlGHlNG)

12:31.835 --> 12:33.585
You say no more parties,

12:33.670 --> 12:35.879
and then you spend
all of this money
on lunch.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.381
l think it's
a little hypercritical.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.341
l do this for
every branch l go to.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.678
lf you do not like it,
then l think
there are some bagels

12:42.762 --> 12:44.888
left over
from this morning.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.268
Damn it, Stephanie,
put me through to him.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.187
ls that him
in the background?
David?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.898
David.
David, pick up the phone.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.235
Should l seduce him?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.655
No. No one
wants to see that.

13:04.826 --> 13:05.784
Michael.

13:05.869 --> 13:06.952
Okay. Yep?

13:07.579 --> 13:11.373
l just realized that
l used the 2008 calendar

13:11.458 --> 13:13.959
to do the spreadsheets
for January and February.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.295
l may need to come in
this weekend to fix it.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.379
Do some overtime.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.505
Want to do
some overtime
this weekend?

13:18.590 --> 13:19.590
You know what, Kevin?

13:19.674 --> 13:21.133
l applaud your initiative.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.551
Yes, you may.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.720
No, sorry, Michael.
No, Kevin, right?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.931
Gonna need you to do that
during office hours.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.641
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.269
Kevin, this is my branch.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.229
You don't ask Charles.
You ask me.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.481
l say approved.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.815
That's not the way
it's gonna work.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.942
Yes, it is.
No, it is not.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.069
No, it is not.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.529
Okay, so we're on
the same page, great.

13:42.614 --> 13:43.989
Okay, so we're on
the same page, great!

13:44.073 --> 13:46.533
Okay, Michael.
No, seriously.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.951
How old are you?
How old are you?

13:48.036 --> 13:48.994
Oh, no.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.164
l can tell Michael's mood
by which comedy routine
he chooses to do.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.500
The more infantile,
the more upset he is.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.503
And he just skipped
the Ace Ventura
talking-butt thing.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.087
He never skips it.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.923
This is bad.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.674
Five years old.
Five years old.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.176
Dude, stop.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.969
DWlGHT: Michael !
This is great.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.179
DWlGHT:
Michael, stop doing that!
This is great.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.222
ANDY:
. . .a whole mess of trouble.
Stop it!

14:08.306 --> 14:10.641
l'm going to walk away.

14:10.725 --> 14:11.767
ANDY: Stop doing that!

14:11.851 --> 14:14.978
l'm kidding around.
Wow! Relax, everybody.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.189
lt's just a joke.
lt's fine.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.901
Boy, so touchy.
PPC, let's continue
our morning meeting

14:20.985 --> 14:22.277
in the conference room.

14:22.654 --> 14:26.573
And then out of that cake
pops another stripper
holding a smaller cake,

14:26.783 --> 14:29.535
and then an even
smaller stripper
pops out of that one.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.370
What is that
smaller stripper holding?

14:31.454 --> 14:32.579
A cupcake.
Nice.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.373
lt's cupcakes and strippers
all the way down.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.582
Okay.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.168
What exactly is the PPC?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.922
That's the Party
Planning Committee.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.466
They spend hours
planning parties.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.468
Excuse me, guys.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.929
What's going on in here?
Party Planning Committee.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.305
Not your concern, Charles.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.058
This doesn't seem
like a good way to
spend company time.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.269
Really? Well, then,
how would we come up

14:55.353 --> 14:58.146
with great ideas
like Jim's? Go ahead.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.731
No, l would like to get
back to work, actually.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.942
Please.
CHARLES: What you got, Jim?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.153
What is
a two-way petting zoo?

15:07.115 --> 15:09.825
You pet the animals,
they pet you back.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.035
lt's a great idea.
And we have a cake

15:12.120 --> 15:14.037
in the shape of
a bale of hay.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.622
lt's really just
a regular-shaped cake. . .

15:15.707 --> 15:17.124
But it's cool, and it's. . .
CHARLES: No.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.418
This isn't a good use
of company time, Michael.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.754
Whoa. You're talking about
my anniversary party, so. . .

15:22.839 --> 15:25.549
Okay, everyone
except for Michael,
go back to your desks.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.259
Thank you very much.
MlCHAEL: Yeah,
why don't you do that?

15:27.343 --> 15:29.386
Yeah, here we go. Okay.
Okay.

15:30.054 --> 15:33.015
Okay, Michael,
l'm dissolving
this committee.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.600
What?
Yeah, l mean, come on !

15:34.684 --> 15:37.519
This is a workplace.
lt isn't designed
for your vanity.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.606
Newsflash.
l've been here
for 1 5 years.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.275
Headline. You have
been here one day.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.735
End of story.

15:44.819 --> 15:48.864
You have no right
to cancel my fifteenth
anniversary party.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.074
End of story.
End of story!
End of story!

15:51.159 --> 15:52.492
l don't care
if l've hurt your feelings

15:52.577 --> 15:55.829
or you do not
agree with my methods,
but it is over.

15:55.913 --> 15:59.374
Okay, no, no, no,
you know what?
l'm going to New York,

15:59.709 --> 16:02.127
and l am going to talk
to David Wallace.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.087
l'm going to
tell him everything,

16:04.172 --> 16:06.423
and l'm sorry to say,
you're screwed.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.091
And you know what?

16:08.176 --> 16:10.719
You are gonna be through.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.347
And l'm sorry.
l'm sorry to do
that to you.

16:13.598 --> 16:14.640
Right.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.558
Do you even know
how paper is made?

16:17.560 --> 16:18.727
lt's not like steel.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.937
You don't put it
into a furnace!

16:22.148 --> 16:24.983
lf you put paper
into a furnace,
you know what would happen?

16:25.068 --> 16:26.735
You'd ruin it!

16:37.664 --> 16:38.914
Come in.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.666
Hey!
Hey.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.334
All right, Charles,
l gotta be honest.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.504
l think we really got off
on the wrong foot here,

16:45.588 --> 16:49.925
and, truth be told,
l'm a pretty smart guy
and a hard worker

16:50.009 --> 16:51.677
and l'm a great
number two for the office.

16:51.761 --> 16:52.844
Number two?

16:52.929 --> 16:55.055
Second-in-command
to Michael.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.724
l didn't know that
position existed.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.435
That's because at first it was
a made-up position for Dwight,

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
just to make him feel better.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.271
Assistant to
the Regional Manager.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.190
But then he lost that,
and Michael gave it to me.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.984
So you're the Assistant
to the Regional Manager?

17:08.069 --> 17:09.444
Assistant
Regional Manager, yeah.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.280
Any responsibilities
come with it?

17:13.950 --> 17:14.950
No, not exactly.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.911
Do you want to keep
this made-up position?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.622
lt's important to you?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.668
All right, l will. . .

17:24.794 --> 17:26.837
l'm just going to
let you get back to it.
Yeah, would you. . .

17:26.921 --> 17:28.380
Yep.
Thanks.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.180
Hello, Stephanie.
Okay, where is he?

17:39.475 --> 17:40.684
Michael.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.313
So is this the meeting
you've been in all day?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.481
How did you get here,
Michael?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.150
l drove.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.861
Okay.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.030
Cancelled my fifteenth
anniversary party.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.866
Just pulled the rug
out from under me.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.910
He said no figs.
l've already bought them,

17:58.995 --> 18:00.871
and l don't have
a place to store them.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.749
So l feel like
l've been sort of boned.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.709
Michael. . .
Did you talk to him
about this?

18:05.793 --> 18:08.044
You've talked to him
all day, obviously.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.588
Did you talk to him
about this?

18:09.672 --> 18:11.590
Well, l didn't know
about the figs
specifically. . .

18:11.674 --> 18:12.841
No, okay,
then l don't get it.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.217
lt doesn't make
any sense to me,

18:14.302 --> 18:15.469
because l thought
the new system was

18:15.553 --> 18:17.596
that l was supposed
to talk to Charles,

18:17.680 --> 18:19.264
and then Charles was
supposed to talk to you,

18:19.348 --> 18:21.558
and that would dilute
any need for me

18:21.642 --> 18:22.893
to ever talk to you again.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.060
That's not
exactly the system. . .

18:24.145 --> 18:25.937
Clearly that's
what you wanted.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.022
No. . .

18:27.106 --> 18:28.523
Fifteen years
l've been here,

18:28.775 --> 18:30.859
and l have sacrificed a lot.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.736
Yes.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.362
l've put having
a family on hold.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.406
We didn't ask you to do that.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.784
And l have never
gone hang-gliding.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.621
And l've never driven
my car to the top
of Mount Washington.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.874
Okay.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.667
Nice meeting everyone.
JlM: All right.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.586
l'll see you in
a couple of weeks.
Cool.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.004
JlM: Excellent.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.841
lt was very nice
meeting you,
Charles Miner.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.552
Okay.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.554
See you.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.600
See you !

19:05.436 --> 19:06.520
Bye!

19:09.941 --> 19:13.860
And for my next trick,
l will make
my career disappear.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.571
l could see our kids
facing obstacles,

19:16.656 --> 19:18.448
being half black
and half lndian,

19:18.533 --> 19:20.826
but it's so worth it,
you guys.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.911
There's just me here.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.497
l am going to get him
to buy me
a prime rib tonight.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.499
l think he left.
What?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.252
Move!

19:32.255 --> 19:33.797
Hello? Charles?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.590
Charles?

19:35.842 --> 19:36.925
Hey!

19:37.885 --> 19:39.553
ls that his scarf?

19:40.471 --> 19:41.513
No!

19:43.599 --> 19:46.059
Charles and Kelly?
Absolutely not.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.770
He is a sophisticated man.

19:48.980 --> 19:53.191
He does not need to
go dumpster-diving
for companionship, okay?

19:54.485 --> 19:59.739
l don't understand that,
after 1 5 years
of service here,

20:00.449 --> 20:03.910
l have to get in a car
and drive to New York
in order to talk to you.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.871
That doesn't
seem right to me.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.582
That doesn't seem fair,
and l think

20:10.001 --> 20:12.335
that l've earned
more than that.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.340
Yep.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.928
You're right, yes.
l get it.
l get it, Michael.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.972
Okay.
Here's what l'm gonna do.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.056
(SlGHS) Okay.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.475
We will move
some money around,

20:27.852 --> 20:31.438
and l will
personally see to it
that you have your party,

20:31.981 --> 20:34.900
you have your figs.
l will be in attendance.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.319
lt's gonna be great.
How's that?

20:37.445 --> 20:38.653
(SCOFFlNG)

20:43.034 --> 20:44.743
l quit.

20:44.827 --> 20:45.952
What?

20:48.247 --> 20:51.249
Michael.
You have no idea
how high l can fly.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.255
