Slugs are

One went right
through him.

it's not 'cause
the stereo's up too loud.

But you still need a permit
for a handgun.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.124
What happened to the bike?

09:19.126 --> 09:21.126
What?

asking, then?

Come on.

He didn't see nothing.

Hey, who's asking you, pal, huh?

Nice and clean,
hardly a scratch.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.776
That was

Sometimes bullets take
a very strange route.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.784
This one corkscrewed down

We're lucky
we found it.

Fired from this gun,

Multiples-- one set loud

13:37.284 --> 13:39.284
I wasn't there.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.286
Your prints were.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.221
I got an alibi.

13:43.222 --> 13:45.155
Who cares? That's the gun
that killed the baby.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.825
It's got your
fingerprints
all over it.

13:46.827 --> 13:50.361
Maybe the gun killed him,
but not me.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.031
Roneld, stupid and tough
is a bad combination.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.533
Yeah, well, it works for you,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.575
Yo, forget Spofford.
I ain't going to no Spofford.

You find who did it?

14:20.227 --> 14:24.229
Maybe... maybe.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.998
Listen, did Gregory
know a guy

14:27.000 --> 14:28.533
named Roneld Griggs?

14:28.535 --> 14:31.169
I don't know. Why?

14:31.171 --> 14:34.005
Well, he had the gun that...

14:36.209 --> 14:38.610
We need a motive.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.579
Was Gregory involved with...?

14:41.581 --> 14:43.081
With what?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.149
Drugs.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.954
Wednesday and Thursday nights,
Saturday mornings

Gregory plays basketball.

Monday and Tuesday nights

14:54.227 --> 14:56.995
he got choir practice.

14:56.997 --> 15:00.265
Gregory ain't perfect,
but he ain't into no dope.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.633
I can guarantee you that.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.134
Look, Mrs. Winters, no offense,

15:03.136 --> 15:05.303
but sometimes you can't tell
these kind of thing.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.172
Maybe you can't,
but I sure as hell can.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.174
Look, I know it's not easy...

15:10.176 --> 15:11.643
Easy?

15:11.645 --> 15:17.348
Mister, I got a dead baby,
a boy who may be cripple

15:17.350 --> 15:20.251
and a supervisor who tells me

15:20.253 --> 15:23.988
that going to the morgue
and to the hospital

15:23.990 --> 15:26.257
is considered personal time.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.360
And now you saying maybe Greg...

15:29.362 --> 15:32.130
Gregory was on drugs?

15:32.132 --> 15:35.266
Maybe he brought this
on himself?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.604
I'm sorry.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.640
Get out of here.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.642
All right?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.045
I got work to do.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.718
Gregory Winters
was a classic point guard.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.321
He ran the floor,
you know what I'm saying?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.690
The kid was the brains
of this team.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.291
Then he isn't
in a gang?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.659
He didn't have time
for that.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.161
He thought those guys
were lame.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.164
You ever see him
hang out with a kid

16:06.166 --> 16:08.199
with a checkerboard haircut,
sparked-out teeth?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.168
That kind of crap's
out there.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.087
But like I say,

16:12.088 --> 16:14.005
my boys don't have time
for stuff like that.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.306
Thanks.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.043
Gregory Winters is a good kid.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.211
He plays ball, that's it.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.147
No link to Roneld whatsoever.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.717
A lot
of partial prints.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.185
Only Roneld's
for sure.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.753
And does that make
a case against him?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.106
No, it does not.

16:31.107 --> 16:33.458
But if he didn't fire the gun,
at least he knows who did.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.194
Hey, look, I would like
to have another crack at him.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.246
Fine. Great.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.297
Only this time, make sure
a parent is in the room.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.167
Otherwise, legally, the kid's
flapping his lips for nothing.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.203
Be gentle, Mike.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.705
Don't break the little creep's
trigger finger.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.244
Ronnie never
killed nobody.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.345
Right.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.247
He's a good boy.

16:56.249 --> 17:00.318
Just two prior gun possessions
and a dope misdemeanor.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.303
What about yesterday?

17:02.304 --> 17:04.287
Let's make that three guns,
two drugs.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.224
Sounds to me
like a year minimum.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.026
Ain't nothing to it.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.227
Oh? Why's that?

17:09.229 --> 17:12.030
You like it in prison, punk?

17:16.102 --> 17:20.238
Maybe if we knew
exactly what you was looking...

17:20.240 --> 17:23.241
We want to know
who pulled the damn trigger.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.811
Because it sure as hell looks
like your boy did it.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.221
Tell them, Ronnie.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.323
No.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.762
You think you can play

17:44.764 --> 17:47.298
this fool game with me?!

17:51.538 --> 17:53.771
Tell them.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.343
I lent the gun to Dizz.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.281
Who's Dizz?

18:03.283 --> 18:06.451
His cousin.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.222
What's he look like?

18:11.224 --> 18:15.359
He's got some design
cut in his head

18:15.361 --> 18:18.229
like a checkerboard.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.299
I don't suppose he's sporting
a lot of gold teeth.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.135
Fort Knox.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.324
Yo! Yo!

18:46.326 --> 18:49.827
Which one of you guys
is Dizz Williams?

18:57.537 --> 19:00.905
Well, look
at them gold teeth.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.557
Hello, Dizz.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.208
The tec-9 you got
from your cousin Ronnie

19:04.210 --> 19:06.244
who used it
when you were on the stoop?

19:06.246 --> 19:07.345
I want a lawyer.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.447
Give him a lawyer.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.215
Who used the gun?

19:11.217 --> 19:13.384
I want to know the name.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.819
I got no name.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.387
Wrong. You got a name.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.390
And pretty soon,
you're going to have a number.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.260
You're under arrest
for the murder of Andrew Winter.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.294
You have the right
to remain silent

19:23.296 --> 19:25.263
and refuse
to answer questions.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.231
Anything you do say may be used
against you in a court of law.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.399
So you're saying
you've never been

19:28.401 --> 19:30.168
in that building before, huh?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.904
What'd I say? I said I was in
south Carolina till last night.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.906
That's right. With family.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.308
How could you shoot the hell
out of the Winters family

19:37.310 --> 19:39.277
if you were down south
with your family?

19:39.279 --> 19:41.345
I don't you before, I don't know
nothing about no shooting.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.248
Oh, well, the gun that
was used in the shooting

19:44.250 --> 19:46.350
the one that you
know nothing about--

19:46.352 --> 19:49.353
your cousin Roneld
said he gave it to you.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.488
Roneld a punk.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.522
You're dissin' me.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.491
Roneld would never say that.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.926
I'm dissin' you?

19:54.928 --> 19:55.927
Huh?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.261
Oh, I forgot.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.629
You're such a big man.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.532
It takes a real big man
to ice a baby.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.401
I didn't ice nobody.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.636
Yeah? Well, then you're going
down for someone else's bummer

20:05.638 --> 20:08.539
'cause right now we've got
a witness that puts you there.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.608
And you had the gun.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.676
My boy's 13.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.311
You can't do
nothing like this.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.413
You got to go to juvie
you got to go...

20:15.415 --> 20:17.348
We can do plenty
when it comes

20:17.350 --> 20:19.317
to felony homicide,
Mr. Williams.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.285
And if you don't want
to blow parole, just shut up!

20:21.287 --> 20:23.571
You're dissin' me.
DIZZ:

20:23.572 --> 20:25.856
nothing about no shooting.
Like I said, I don't know

20:25.858 --> 20:28.426
It's not enough
that he had the gun.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.928
His prints could
have been from any time.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.431
You got a witness
who saw him at the shooting.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.432
Tonel Oden?

20:34.434 --> 20:35.866
A 12-year-old.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.868
As we all know,
not terrific on the stand.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.403
Roneld gave
Dizz the gun.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.404
Says Roneld.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.672
Let's be realistic here.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.642
Juvenile court judges
may not like kids with guns

20:44.644 --> 20:48.279
but they like a clean case
and they want a motive.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.315
Who says the little son of
a bitch needs a motive?

20:51.317 --> 20:52.316
Max...

20:52.318 --> 20:53.451
What the hell's
a motive anyway?

20:53.453 --> 20:55.453
He took my seat-- bam!

20:55.455 --> 20:57.922
He's looking
at my girlfriend-- bam!

20:57.924 --> 20:59.924
I need them shoes-- bam!

20:59.926 --> 21:03.394
Max has been busting
his chops on this case.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.495
I understand.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.931
Whoa, I can apologize
for myself.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.267
Only I don't feel apologetic.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.568
I'm fed up!

21:18.645 --> 21:23.547
You put together a strong case,
we'll put him away, Sergeant.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.350
I know, I know.

21:26.352 --> 21:29.720
Why am I picking
a fight with you?

21:29.722 --> 21:33.357
You know what it is, Paul?

21:33.359 --> 21:35.626
Dizz is 13.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.362
The boy in the hospital--
he's 12.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.398
The baby's in the ground

21:40.400 --> 21:43.668
and our emergency rooms
are up to their ears

21:43.670 --> 21:46.671
with kids on the wrong end
of stray bullets

21:46.673 --> 21:49.407
and this little scuz
is laughing at us

21:49.409 --> 21:53.377
'cause he knows he's a juvenile
and we can't get him.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.517
That's not necessarily true.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.909
BAILIFF:
People versus Williams.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.460
<i> Counsel waive reading</i>
<i> of the rights and charges</i>

22:09.462 --> 22:11.462
Your Honor, this is a joke.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.964
You can't try this boy
as an adult.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.750
We should be
in family court.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.535
ROBINETTE:
Mr. Williams may be only 13,
Your Honor,

22:17.537 --> 22:18.769
but the statute
is clear--

22:18.771 --> 22:20.404
he's here on
a felony complaint

22:20.406 --> 22:22.023
charging intentional
Murder Two.

22:22.024 --> 22:23.641
Mr. Robinette,
can I get in a word here?

22:23.643 --> 22:24.975
This boy have any priors?

22:24.977 --> 22:27.194
Two, Your Honor,
both involving guns.

22:27.195 --> 22:29.412
We believe these show a real
propensity to violence.

22:29.415 --> 22:32.049
If the court remands
to Supreme Criminal

22:32.051 --> 22:34.118
you'll indict
on intentional Murder Two?

22:34.120 --> 22:35.519
Absolutely.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.787
Your Honor, with all
due respect,

22:36.789 --> 22:38.089
isn't this
kind of overkill?

22:38.091 --> 22:39.090
Kill?

22:39.092 --> 22:41.425
I wouldn't use that word in here

22:41.427 --> 22:43.427
if the accused were my client.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.563
Mr. Williams knew exactly
what he was doing.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.632
It is just and appropriate
that he be tried

22:48.634 --> 22:50.534
as an adult.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.435
Your Honor, I intend to
submit written motions...

22:52.438 --> 22:53.471
Be my guest.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.072
Anything further, Mr. Robinette?

22:55.074 --> 22:56.640
The people ask that Mr. Williams

22:56.642 --> 22:58.609
be remanded without bail
to an appropriate

22:58.611 --> 23:00.711
juvenile facility
pending trial.
So ordered.

23:00.713 --> 23:01.779
Case transferred
to Supreme Court.

23:01.781 --> 23:02.813
This is jive!

23:02.815 --> 23:04.115
I didn't burn nobody!

23:04.117 --> 23:05.449
This is a setup!

23:05.451 --> 23:06.817
Get off me, man!

23:06.819 --> 23:08.786
You going to stand there?

23:08.788 --> 23:11.122
This is a setup.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.057
Get off me.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.742
Listen, Stone,
this kid didn't do it.

23:14.743 --> 23:16.426
Now, I understand
you're getting a lot of heat.

23:16.429 --> 23:17.461
Knock off
the sermon, Alex.

23:17.463 --> 23:18.662
Your client had the gun.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.064
The judge's decision
is totally unwarranted.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.132
Mr. Williams was
out in front

23:21.134 --> 23:22.566
at the time
of the murder.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.468
An eyewitness
who can see in the dark?

23:24.470 --> 23:25.469
Very compelling.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.437
The stoop
is well lit.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.805
Tonel saw somebody else.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.107
He won't be testifying
against me.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.877
For your sake, young man,
I hope you didn't threaten him.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.612
LAWYER:
What are we talking about?

23:34.614 --> 23:37.648
He pleads as an accessory
to manslaughter two.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.483
He gives us the shooter.

23:39.485 --> 23:43.087
I was at
my aunt Cecile's in Carolina.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.423
Wasn't nowhere
near New York City.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.824
Cut the crap, Dizz.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.160
The police in Charleston
talked to a guy named Summers.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.161
Who?

23:50.163 --> 23:51.762
The guy who put you
on the train

23:51.764 --> 23:53.798
to New York City,
four days
before the murder.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.503
Who shot the baby?

24:01.841 --> 24:04.108
A dude named T-Ball.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.709
T-Ball Howard.

24:05.711 --> 24:06.710
Real name?

24:06.712 --> 24:07.878
Franklin.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.449
He come to me
and said he needed a burner.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.450
For what?

24:12.452 --> 24:13.451
A job, man.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.686
He says this job was worth $500.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.521
I borrowed
the burner from Roneld.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.790
Roneld let you borrow
a gun worth $1,500?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.525
Who hired your friend
to do the job?

24:21.527 --> 24:23.194
He didn't tell me.

24:23.196 --> 24:26.096
He just said he needed the gun.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.198
And then what?

24:27.200 --> 24:29.800
I rented it
from Roneld for $100.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.635
Charged T-Ball $200.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.904
I didn't shoot that baby, man.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.173
T-Ball did.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.213
ROBINETTE:
That T-Ball?

25:14.614 --> 25:17.515
Five minutes, counselor,
then I want him alone.

25:17.517 --> 25:21.685
I told you, I never been
on Jacob's place.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.587
And I'll bet you never rented
a tec-nine.

25:23.589 --> 25:24.588
Tec-nine?

25:24.590 --> 25:25.990
What's that? Mouthwash?

25:25.992 --> 25:28.292
Who ordered the hit, T-Ball?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.731
That's right, genius.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.734
Your buddy Dizz told us
the whole story.

25:36.736 --> 25:40.004
And he's going to repeat it
in court.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.913
Why don't you let me
talk to my client.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.881
The Howard kid will roll.
He's got no choice.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.550
You'd better hope
you're right,

25:52.552 --> 25:54.285
'cause we still ain't
got idea one

25:54.287 --> 25:55.753
why he shot
the Winters boys.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.821
Anything else
on T-Ball?

25:57.823 --> 25:59.089
He's 14 years old

25:59.091 --> 26:01.692
lives with his mother
and 2-year-old brother.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.327
No gang affiliation.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.095
He even know
Gregory Winters?

26:05.097 --> 26:07.598
There's no indications.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.067
The Winters kid
been upgraded yet?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.336
Yeah, he regained
consciousness last night.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.608
Franklin Howard,
tall guy, thin?

26:17.610 --> 26:18.976
Sure you don't know him?

26:18.978 --> 26:21.045
I don't know him.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.283
Sorry.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.619
These things
have to be asked.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.022
How do you feel?

26:35.795 --> 26:38.329
Okay.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.933
Thanks, Gregory.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.937
Excuse me.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.782
Why do you people insist
on blaming my boy?

26:58.784 --> 27:00.050
I'm sorry.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.052
He doesn't know
these boys.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.788
He didn't do anything
to cause them

27:04.790 --> 27:07.091
to shoot up
the apartment.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.627
I know.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.767
Ben.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.136
Mr. Howard understands
that you can convict him.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.738
He's ready to deal.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.905
I thought
he might be.

27:21.907 --> 27:23.674
He names the buyer
of the hit,

27:23.676 --> 27:25.142
but he gets tried
as a juvenile.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.076
Not a prayer.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.111
We're in an
epidemic, Brian.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.396
He killed a baby.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.680
The older brother's
a paraplegic.

27:29.682 --> 27:30.914
It was a mistake.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.650
You want to explain that?

27:32.652 --> 27:34.051
Just make me an offer.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.052
Why?

27:35.054 --> 27:36.704
Trust me, Ben.

27:36.705 --> 27:38.355
You make a deal
you'll want the result.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.857
As in?

27:39.859 --> 27:42.192
As in you get a major dealer
off the streets.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.928
T-Ball's just a soldier.

27:44.930 --> 27:47.731
He can give you the general.

27:47.733 --> 27:50.200
Manslaughter one, he gets
sentenced in Supreme Court

27:50.202 --> 27:52.670
and he does
the youthful offender maximum.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.072
Deal.
I do this plea
and you're throwing curves.

27:55.074 --> 27:58.909
Believe me,
you won't regret it.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.812
I know they're screaming
for this kid's head, Adam,

28:01.814 --> 28:04.815
but they're better off
if we put away the dealer.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.016
I want them both.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.551
I want everyone.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.085
I want he kid
who gave him the gun

28:09.088 --> 28:11.989
I want the kid who pulled
the trigger and this pusher.

28:11.991 --> 28:15.159
So do I, but if we don't get
the guy who gave the order

28:15.161 --> 28:16.694
we have more crack,

28:16.695 --> 28:18.228
more contract killings,
more dead kids.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.097
What are they asking for?

28:20.099 --> 28:21.549
Man one.

28:21.550 --> 28:23.000
T-Ball gets three
and a third to ten.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.735
He does the whole ten.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.103
And he's not going
to boarding school, Adam.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.939
You and I wouldn't last
ten minutes in there.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.808
You sure this pays off?

28:30.810 --> 28:33.243
I think I can trust Doxsee.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.745
You think?

28:36.215 --> 28:39.116
I can't afford not to.

28:39.118 --> 28:42.720
He said he needed to get rid
of a business problem.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.755
Somebody burn him
on a drug deal?

28:44.757 --> 28:46.256
It was real estate.

28:46.258 --> 28:50.027
Said it was 300 large.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.131
Had you ever met Ingrams before?

28:54.133 --> 28:57.000
I've done some little jobs
for him.

28:57.002 --> 29:00.087
No hits.

29:00.088 --> 29:03.173
When I heard about this one,
I thought, if I had a gun...

29:03.175 --> 29:06.076
But you didn't know
a baby was behind the door.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.511
That's why I'm
talking to you, man.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.246
I didn't know.

29:09.248 --> 29:13.450
Ingrams gives me the address
of this guy he wants me to do--

29:13.452 --> 29:15.219
Mr. Kay.

29:15.221 --> 29:18.155
I'm supposed
to go air out his crib.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.157
So I go over there.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.160
I hear some voices inside,
but...

29:23.162 --> 29:26.296
just must have gone
to the wrong place.

29:26.298 --> 29:29.466
You thought a real estate tycoon
lived in the Winters' building?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.034
DOXSEE:
Like I told you,

29:31.036 --> 29:32.486
a mistake.

29:32.487 --> 29:33.937
ROBINETTE:
What'd you do
with the address?

29:33.939 --> 29:37.808
I threw it away
after the thing went down.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.947
"This guy
he wants me to do"--

29:43.949 --> 29:45.082
it's not enough.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.818
It would be
if we could connect Ingrams

29:47.820 --> 29:49.253
with the mythical Mr. Kay.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.121
You want me
to have Ingrams brought in?

29:51.123 --> 29:53.490
Why? Have him go through
the motions of deny it?

29:53.492 --> 29:56.160
Do you think it's K,
like Murray the K

29:56.162 --> 29:57.227
or K-A-Y?

29:57.229 --> 29:58.829
Or with an E.

29:58.831 --> 30:01.231
There couldn't be more
than 1,000 variations

30:01.233 --> 30:03.133
in New York City.

30:04.837 --> 30:08.806
That's K-A-Y-E,
five boroughs.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.941
This must be 500 more names.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.877
Well, what do you want me to do?

30:17.049 --> 30:18.549
Start with Manhattan.

30:26.158 --> 30:30.160
Someone was hired
to kill a Mr. Kay.

30:30.162 --> 30:34.031
The hit man went
to 315 Jacobs Place.

30:34.033 --> 30:37.034
You live at 315 Jameson Place.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.269
So?

30:39.271 --> 30:41.972
My husband and I
are active

30:41.974 --> 30:44.374
in the reform democrats,
Mr. Robinette.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.210
We helped found

30:46.212 --> 30:49.246
the Carnegie hill
alternative school.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.549
We were once mentioned
in passing on Page Six

30:52.551 --> 30:56.386
but I doubt any of that
qualifies us for assassination.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.389
What kind of work
does your husband do, Mrs. Kay?

30:59.391 --> 31:01.191
Real estate.

31:02.127 --> 31:03.927
What?

31:03.929 --> 31:05.996
He's guilty of gentrification?

31:05.998 --> 31:09.233
I'm afraid it's going to be
much worse than that.

31:13.205 --> 31:18.175
A month ago Edward M. Kay
deposited 300,000

31:18.177 --> 31:21.011
into his corporate
checking account

31:21.013 --> 31:24.248
but he hasn't made
a sale since August.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.017
And the kid who did the hit
said he mentioned 300,000.

31:27.019 --> 31:30.888
Kay fronted as a buyer
of an apartment for Ingrams.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.289
300,000 cash.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.724
It comes to closing.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.158
Kay doesn't show up
with the money.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.194
He stiffed him, Adam.
He stiffed a drug dealer.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.696
There's
your motive.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.197
And the kid shot up
the wrong apartment.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.398
Unbelievable.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.300
The Winters baby is dead

31:43.302 --> 31:47.037
because a 14-year-old hit man
went into the wrong place.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.039
Do you understand
these people?

31:49.041 --> 31:50.908
They live better
than 99% of humanity

31:50.910 --> 31:53.176
and they have to steal
from drug dealers.

31:53.178 --> 31:56.013
Ingrams will go up for murder,
one way or the other.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.048
If Mr. Kay decides
to testify.

31:58.050 --> 32:01.051
Real estate fraud--
not much to work with.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.703
Maybe Kay
has a conscience.

32:02.704 --> 32:04.354
Yeah, maybe he houses
the homeless in his basement

32:04.356 --> 32:07.157
but I wouldn't
count on it.

32:07.159 --> 32:11.695
I sold a nice two-bedroom
on West End Avenue

32:11.697 --> 32:13.297
to a young black man.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.198
That's a crime?

32:15.200 --> 32:17.034
When you steal
his money, it is.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.302
What stealing?

32:18.304 --> 32:21.038
We had a little problem
with the closing papers.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.041
This chamber of commerce routine
is getting on my nerves.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.710
In 1986 you were arrested
for cocaine possession.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.345
Ingrams your dealer?

32:28.347 --> 32:31.214
An arrest with no conviction
is not relevant here.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.150
It isn't?

32:34.253 --> 32:37.454
You do a little coke,
you figure, what the hell

32:37.456 --> 32:40.123
it's a victimless crime.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.225
You used drug money

32:42.227 --> 32:45.128
to buy real estate.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.197
You think
that makes it clean?

32:47.199 --> 32:49.666
An 11-month-old baby died

32:49.668 --> 32:52.469
because of your sins, Mr. Kay.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.205
LAWYER:
If you want to talk
about his testimony...

32:55.207 --> 32:57.274
What did you do

32:57.276 --> 32:59.409
with the $300,000?

32:59.411 --> 33:02.279
You didn't cheat
some yuppie banker.

33:02.281 --> 33:07.317
Mr. Ingrams-- he doesn't sue,
he hires a hit man.

33:10.255 --> 33:15.359
You haven't mentioned
any incentives for cooperation.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.227
No?

33:17.229 --> 33:21.031
Well, how's this?

33:21.033 --> 33:23.367
If your client
doesn't start talking now

33:23.369 --> 33:26.269
I'll tear his life apart.

33:26.271 --> 33:29.306
Real estate boards,
clients

33:29.308 --> 33:31.141
skeletons in the closet...

33:31.143 --> 33:33.010
light of day.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.778
Guaranteed.

33:46.191 --> 33:50.227
Ingrams came to me with 300,000
he wanted cleaned.

33:50.229 --> 33:53.764
I was in the middle
of a redevelopment project

33:53.766 --> 33:57.234
that is dying
for an infusion of cash.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.335
So you used Ingrams' money.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.437
I thought I could
turn it around.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.240
Get his money in and out
quickly.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.442
The market went soft.

34:05.444 --> 34:08.445
Lenders foreclosed
on the project.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.782
And the $300,000 went to them.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.253
Did Ingrams threaten you?

34:18.223 --> 34:20.290
Oh, no.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.093
No, no.

34:23.095 --> 34:26.129
I point my finger at him,
I'm dead.

34:26.131 --> 34:28.131
You help us out,
we'll put him away.

34:28.133 --> 34:31.101
And if you don't?

34:31.102 --> 34:34.070
And if you don't testify,
he'll get you sooner or later.

34:34.073 --> 34:37.107
I'd rather it was later.

34:37.109 --> 34:40.110
Well, you made your pitch,
Mr. Stone.

34:43.115 --> 34:45.115
And it didn't get through?

34:45.117 --> 34:48.552
I'd rather go to a loan shark
for the 300 grand

34:48.554 --> 34:51.221
than take on Mikeal Ingrams.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.529
ROBINETTE:
Pick Ingrams up.
We have enough to charge him.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.398
Without Kay's testimony?
Come on, Paul.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.400
Ingrams is a maggot.
We can crush him.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.335
He doesn't know
Kay won't testify.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.803
We get him to plead
manslaughter

35:06.805 --> 35:08.789
he's off the street.

35:08.790 --> 35:10.774
At least Kay lives long
enough to change his mind.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.610
Sold.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.545
BAILIFF:
<i> People versus Mikeal Ingrams.</i>

35:15.547 --> 35:18.682
The charges are
murder in the second degree

35:18.684 --> 35:21.418
manslaughter in the first degree

35:21.420 --> 35:24.154
attempted murder
in the second degree

35:24.156 --> 35:26.556
and assault in the first degree.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.692
How does the defendant plead?

35:28.694 --> 35:30.360
Not guilty.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.429
On all counts,
Your Honor.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.431
I'm serving
grand jury notice

35:34.433 --> 35:35.866
upon defense counsel,
Your Honor.

35:35.868 --> 35:40.570
Do the people wish to be heard
on bail, Mr. Robinette?

35:40.572 --> 35:43.640
Your Honor, as a multiple
prior felony offender

35:43.642 --> 35:44.741
and a convicted

35:44.743 --> 35:46.376
narcotics trafficker

35:46.378 --> 35:49.446
Mr. Ingrams faces
mandatory life.

35:49.448 --> 35:52.582
The people request
he be held without bail.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.751
No, counselor.

35:54.752 --> 35:56.919
I believe a high bail
is appropriate in this case.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.522
Name a figure.

35:58.524 --> 36:01.458
The people ask
one million dollars, Your Honor.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.193
So ordered.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.835
You wanted
the whole package, Adam

36:11.837 --> 36:13.170
we delivered.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.571
So far.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.940
If this Ingrams hood
walks on a technicality

36:16.942 --> 36:18.942
all your good works
is<i> bupkes.</i>

36:18.944 --> 36:20.811
Offer him man two.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.679
He engineered the death of
an infant, for heaven sake.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.447
People will be outraged.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.449
People will forget
this outrage as soon as

36:26.451 --> 36:28.685
the next outrage
hits the front page.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.454
The Winters boy isn't
the only innocent victim

36:31.456 --> 36:32.589
in New York City.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.558
Man two

36:34.559 --> 36:36.526
and then go for
the max on sentencing.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.502
Forget it, Stone.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.705
You don't come running
with your hat in your hand

36:48.707 --> 36:50.807
from a position
of strength.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.742
You call this a position
of strength, counselor?

36:52.744 --> 36:55.412
We're offering a deal
so we can wrap this up.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.813
but if you
want to play games...

36:56.815 --> 36:59.633
What games?

36:59.634 --> 37:02.452
You've got the unsubstantiated
testimony of a little psycho

37:02.454 --> 37:03.954
who can't shoot straight.

37:03.956 --> 37:06.556
Let's get something
straight here, Mr. Stone.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.558
I'm not in short pants.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.494
T-Ball's testimony isn't
enough to convict me.

37:11.496 --> 37:12.596
Probably not.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.964
But Ned Kay's will.

37:13.966 --> 37:16.633
Ned Kay?

37:18.971 --> 37:21.972
He won't mess with my thing.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.541
I'm going back to my cell.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.552
Okay, so it's not an even bet.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.654
Even? I wouldn't
give you 20 to one.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.788
So Kay stole his money.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.957
But does a jury
believe he'd kill him?

37:40.959 --> 37:43.560
Ingrams is a drug dealer.

37:43.562 --> 37:46.463
Doesn't look like a drug dealer.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.633
You want me not to go to trial?

37:49.635 --> 37:51.668
Mr. Kay is still
a question mark.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.570
What have you got
on his finances?

37:53.572 --> 37:55.572
Is there a federal tax charge?

37:55.574 --> 37:58.775
The I.R.S.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.644
We do not let
tax evaders walk.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.812
If it's major fraud,
he goes to jail.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.582
Come on, Sam, you can still
make an example of him.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.484
No, never. Forget
about it. Go away.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.518
Take his money.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.520
Put him
in the poorhouse

38:10.522 --> 38:12.522
but don't send him
to jail.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.624
And what do you get?

38:14.625 --> 38:16.725
A dealer and a killer
off the street.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.330
Okay.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.332
But I want it
in writing

38:22.334 --> 38:23.867
in letters
eight feet high.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.602
When they go
for my neck

38:25.604 --> 38:27.904
I want yours
in the noose with me.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.873
Tax fraud, Mr. Morton.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.609
Your client goes away
for ten years.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.612
Ten years
in a federal country club.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.714
I can work on my tennis game.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.716
It's better than being dead.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.686
Suppose I convince the I.R.S.
Not to prosecute.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.992
I'll bite.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.660
Suppose you do?

38:50.662 --> 38:52.562
They take every dime.

38:52.564 --> 38:55.098
You don't even keep
the dishwasher.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.467
But if you testify

38:57.468 --> 38:59.835
you can move to Nebraska
the day the trial is over.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.906
You son of a bitch.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.041
You set this up.

39:05.043 --> 39:08.712
The deal is good
for 15 seconds.

39:11.650 --> 39:15.785
I keep the house in Sag Harbor.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.787
No, you don't.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.823
Ten seconds.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.659
The Mercedes.

39:22.661 --> 39:23.993
They take the Mercedes.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.862
Five seconds.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.882
When you told Mr. Ingrams

39:45.884 --> 39:48.651
that you were unable
to return his money

39:48.653 --> 39:49.619
how did he respond?

39:49.621 --> 39:51.688
He indicated
he would kill me.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.757
Objection. Indicated?!

39:53.759 --> 39:57.093
When Mr. Kay continues,
I think you'll find it
admissible, Your Honor.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.695
I'll allow it.
Go ahead, Mr. Stone.

39:58.697 --> 40:01.598
How did he indicate it, Mr. Kay?

40:01.600 --> 40:06.836
He said he would have my place
aired out.

40:06.838 --> 40:09.773
No further questions.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.445
Mr. Kay, you testified
Mr. Ingrams said

40:15.447 --> 40:17.614
he'd air your place out.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.716
Could he have meant he'd
break all your windows?

40:19.718 --> 40:20.917
Don't be ridiculous.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.117
Please just stick
to yes or no.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.854
This cash you allege
came from the defendant--

40:24.856 --> 40:26.856
you said you used it to bail out

40:26.858 --> 40:28.892
one of your own projects,
is that right??

40:28.894 --> 40:30.193
Yes.

40:30.195 --> 40:33.830
Well, did you?

40:33.832 --> 40:34.964
Yes.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.634
At least, I tried, but...

40:37.636 --> 40:38.802
But what?

40:42.741 --> 40:45.442
Did your habit interfere
with business, Mr. Kay?

40:45.444 --> 40:46.743
Objection, Your Honor.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.011
Sidebar, Your Honor?

40:50.749 --> 40:52.799
What's this about?

40:52.800 --> 40:54.850
I'm going to impeach
his credibility, Judge.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.153
He's a cocaine user.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.755
Your Honor,
the people are aware

40:58.757 --> 41:00.223
of Mr. Kay's
'86 arrest

41:00.225 --> 41:02.058
but he was not
convicted.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.760
It's not relevant,
it's not admissible.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.495
Do you have an offer
of proof, counselor?

41:05.497 --> 41:07.831
Why don't we
just go to the record.

41:12.471 --> 41:13.770
Mr. Stone.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.244
Go ahead, Mr. Anson.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.679
Mr. Kay...

41:22.681 --> 41:25.048
under the name

41:25.050 --> 41:28.218
Edward M. Kayman,
you were convicted

41:28.220 --> 41:30.954
of possession
of a controlled substance

41:30.956 --> 41:35.258
in the state of Connecticut
in 1984?

41:37.762 --> 41:40.063
In fact,

41:40.065 --> 41:44.234
it was cocaine, was it not?

41:46.872 --> 41:50.740
Answer the question,
Mr. Kay.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.075
Yes.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.744
And later you legally
changed your name

41:54.746 --> 41:56.713
to Ned Kay, didn't you?

41:56.715 --> 41:58.781
Yes.

41:58.783 --> 42:04.787
Do you still use cocaine,
Mr. Kay?

42:07.192 --> 42:08.992
I respectfully

42:08.994 --> 42:11.895
refuse to answer,
on the, uh...

42:11.897 --> 42:14.264
Are you invoking
the Fifth Amendment

42:14.266 --> 42:16.065
against self-incrimination?

42:16.067 --> 42:17.200
Yes, sir.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.002
Did you pay
for cocaine

42:19.004 --> 42:21.004
out of any of the $300,000

42:21.006 --> 42:25.108
that you stole
from Mr. Ingrams?

42:25.110 --> 42:28.244
I respectfully refuse to answer
for the same reason.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.246
You refuse to answer

42:30.248 --> 42:32.849
but you expect us to believe

42:32.851 --> 42:36.119
that Mr. Ingrams threatened
to kill you.

42:36.121 --> 42:37.754
Objection,
Your Honor.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.122
JUDGE:
Sustained.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.224
The jury will disregard
that remark.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.192
No further questions.

42:47.899 --> 42:51.601
So after Mr. Ingrams told you
to air out the dude's crib

42:51.603 --> 42:53.687
what did you do?

42:53.688 --> 42:55.772
I went up on the roof
and smoked some weed.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.340
Then I got the gun
from my stash.

42:57.342 --> 42:58.875
Which was where?

42:58.877 --> 43:00.877
In my locker in school.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.580
In school?

43:03.581 --> 43:06.282
And you rented this gun
from Dizz Williams, right?

43:07.285 --> 43:09.285
Then what did you do?

43:09.287 --> 43:12.055
I smoked
a little more weed

43:12.057 --> 43:14.891
then I went over
to do the do.

43:14.893 --> 43:18.127
Which was supposed to be
315 Jameson Place.

43:18.129 --> 43:20.129
Now you knew that

43:20.131 --> 43:24.867
because Mikeal Ingrams
wrote it out for you

43:24.869 --> 43:26.869
is that true?

43:26.871 --> 43:28.004
Yes.

43:28.006 --> 43:31.608
Then why did you go
to 315 Jacobs Place?

43:33.311 --> 43:36.312
Answer the question, Mr. Howard.

43:36.314 --> 43:39.248
It was a mistake.

43:39.250 --> 43:44.220
This is the correct address.

43:44.222 --> 43:47.123
Would you read that
out to the court, please?

43:47.125 --> 43:50.827
"315 Jameson Place."

43:50.829 --> 43:52.128
Right.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.997
Now would you read this?

43:55.634 --> 43:58.901
Objection.
Relevance, Your Honor.

43:58.903 --> 44:00.336
It goes to the factual elements

44:00.338 --> 44:02.405
of the crime charged,
Your Honor.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.307
I'll allow it.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.342
Just read the police report.

44:06.344 --> 44:08.344
You don't have to read
the big legal words.

44:08.346 --> 44:11.147
Just give us
the easy ones.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.890
Mr. Howard?

44:23.328 --> 44:27.163
You can't read, can you?

44:31.302 --> 44:35.371
You can't read anything?

44:35.373 --> 44:38.908
No.

44:49.421 --> 44:51.387
No further questions.

44:57.729 --> 44:59.996
Gregory Winters is a victim.

44:59.998 --> 45:02.298
His mother, Denise Winters,
is a victim, as well.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.333
And to a lesser extent

45:04.335 --> 45:07.403
Franklin "T-Ball" Howard
is a victim, too--

45:07.405 --> 45:09.405
a victim of circumstance,

45:09.407 --> 45:13.309
in which he learned
how to fire a deadly weapon

45:13.311 --> 45:16.345
before he learned to read.

45:16.347 --> 45:19.449
And then, of course,
there is Andrew Winters

45:19.451 --> 45:24.420
who would have celebrated
his first birthday not long ago.

45:24.422 --> 45:27.423
Now, maybe we've all become
so accustomed

45:27.425 --> 45:32.729
to slaughter in our streets,
in our subways, in our homes

45:32.731 --> 45:35.732
that it takes
the killing of a baby

45:35.734 --> 45:37.400
to snap us out of it.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.735
I don't know.

45:38.737 --> 45:40.303
What I do know

45:40.305 --> 45:42.305
is that when Mikeal Ingrams

45:42.307 --> 45:45.174
ordered the contract killing
of Ned Kay

45:45.176 --> 45:48.077
he was ordering the killing
of Andrew Winters.

45:48.079 --> 45:52.448
It doesn't matter
that the wrong person was hit.

45:52.450 --> 45:56.452
Mikeal Ingrams' intent
was to kill.

45:56.454 --> 46:01.357
And legally,
intent follows the bullet.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.459
In the eyes of the law

46:03.461 --> 46:05.528
Mikeal Ingrams
is guilty of murder.

46:05.530 --> 46:07.964
In the eyes of society

46:07.966 --> 46:12.401
he is guilty of the slaughter
of an innocent.

46:18.343 --> 46:21.344
Mr. Stone, do you think
the murder conviction

46:21.346 --> 46:22.896
will stand on appeal?

46:22.897 --> 46:24.447
Absolutely-- there's no
reversible error here.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.349
Mikeal Ingrams is as guilty
of killing that little boy

46:26.351 --> 46:28.417
as if he'd pulled
the trigger himself.

46:32.357 --> 46:34.090
Mrs. Winters...

46:34.092 --> 46:37.426
were you satisfied
with today's verdict?

46:40.098 --> 46:41.364
I'm thinking...

46:41.366 --> 46:45.334
what about the boy
who did pull the trigger?

46:45.336 --> 46:48.337
He'll be back out
in seven years.

46:48.339 --> 46:53.242
My baby would have been
eight years old then.

46:53.244 --> 46:56.312
Would you be satisfied?
