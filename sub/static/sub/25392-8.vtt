00:19.978 --> 00:21.146
<i>We shot a cop.</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:23.982
<i>This dirty-ass cop got to Sugar.</i>

00:24.524 --> 00:28.445
<i>And then, he tried to flip you
by threatening to send you back to jail.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:30.906
<i>But you wouldn't play ball.</i>

00:32.491 --> 00:33.492
<i>Never.</i>

00:33.575 --> 00:36.119
<i>Shit got heated,
and he pulled his gun.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:37.871
<i>You killed him.</i>

00:37.955 --> 00:40.374
<i>It was self-defense. Plain and simple.</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:42.417
<i>Exactly.</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:43.794
<i>You shot him first.</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:47.130
<i>And then, with his dying breath,
he raised his gun...</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.924
and...

00:55.389 --> 00:58.475
<i>I was gonna get us both out.
Like he said.</i>

00:58.559 --> 01:02.229
<i>I didn't want out.
It was gonna be different this time.</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:03.313
<i>I know.</i>

01:03.939 --> 01:07.401
<i>Because I love you,
I was blinded by that shit.</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:11.863
<i>I didn't see the snitch in you.</i>

01:13.031 --> 01:14.950
What the hell does that say about me?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.083
How can you be so calm?

02:06.918 --> 02:10.839
People always come after us
because of who we are.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.299
You've always said that.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.802
Just never thought it'd be like this.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.641
You know what? Let's just tell them.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.184
We don't say shit.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.477
Mommy.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.897
We handle things on our own.

02:29.358 --> 02:33.362
What he did to us will never be forgotten.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.574
It's not to them to complicate it.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.869
We don't say shit.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.413
Hey, read me?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.040
Mmm-hmm.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.542
We're still here.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.836
That's all that matters.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.472
But we're only still here because of him.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.228
No, no, let's get out of here. Let's go.
They cannot help us.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.687
- Where we gonna go?
- Anywhere!

03:07.771 --> 03:09.689
The brownstone is gone.

03:10.941 --> 03:14.736
That savage is probably sitting up
in Harlem's Paradise right now.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.572
Where we going?

03:23.412 --> 03:24.413
Where?

03:26.289 --> 03:27.290
Excuse me.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.962
A detective was supposed to debrief us
an hour ago.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.004
Where is everybody?

03:33.088 --> 03:34.965
I'm not at liberty to say.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.258
Well, I need some answers.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.718
I don't know what to tell you.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.225
Where is everybody?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.402
What did you say to her?

03:56.153 --> 03:57.696
I don't work for you, Mariah.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.698
I said I was gonna hire you.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.950
And I said I would get you to safety.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.870
And I've done my part.
The rest is up to you.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.376
She okay?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.128
You have any kids?

04:13.211 --> 04:15.213
Are you trying to threaten me again?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.884
Don't think for one second
that I don't know who you are.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.802
Then why did you save me?

04:27.809 --> 04:30.562
Mostly just to see why Bushmaster
hates you as much as I do.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.688
Who?

04:31.772 --> 04:33.607
Oh, come on, Mariah. Really?

04:33.690 --> 04:38.278
What I was trying to say
was children matter.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.864
They hold our hopes, our dreams.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.784
They blot out your mistakes.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.037
I'll do anything to keep her safe.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.663
Well, she deserves better.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.873
She does.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.708
So protect her.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.212
How can I, when you
won't be straight with me?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.215
Why does Bushmaster want you dead?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.384
Maybe I should protect her from you.

05:03.595 --> 05:07.599
- Put her in Interrogation 1 now!
- What? I'm the victim.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.478
- Am I under arrest?
- No. You can leave. Go.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.527
That's what I thought.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.861
What about Tilda?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.405
I got her, Mariah.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.539
You work for her now.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.791
No. Not really.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.337
What's wrong?

05:38.797 --> 05:41.132
Ridenhour was killed last night.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.260
- What?
- Yeah.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.473
He had a snitch in Harlem's Paradise,
and nobody knew about it except for me.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.518
He went to go talk to her about Piranha,

05:51.601 --> 05:52.811
and now he is dead.

05:54.688 --> 05:59.025
She cleaned up shop,
just like she did with Candace.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.700
You should've let that bitch burn.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.870
You were six when you guys met.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.664
Seven.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.083
Fresh Air Fund.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.918
Then the corner.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.131
You couldn't speak a lick of English.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.969
Kids kicking your ass
up and down the block,

07:49.052 --> 07:51.596
calling out <i>"puta," "maricรณn,"</i> but...

07:55.350 --> 07:57.686
Darius wouldn't let no one tease you.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.774
He always had your back.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.236
Always.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.826
You've never been a good liar, Hernan,

08:12.909 --> 08:14.411
so don't tell me some bullshit

08:14.494 --> 08:18.081
about Darius being caught up
with some sideways cop.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.960
He was a soldier, like his daddy.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.254
He'd never snitch.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.091
What happened last night?

08:35.682 --> 08:40.145
The Darius I knew
would never, ever talk...

08:44.315 --> 08:45.316
I'm sorry.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.574
What's the word, Sugar?

08:54.325 --> 08:55.410
Calm down.

08:56.828 --> 08:57.829
What?

08:59.414 --> 09:00.415
Where?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.043
All right.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.187
You may be the only person in this world
grieving as hard as I am.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.190
Romeo's gone.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.192
Comanche's gone...

09:27.275 --> 09:30.111
Don't use that name for my Darius.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.780
Darius...

09:33.156 --> 09:34.949
would've wanted me to take care of you.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.332
And I will.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.416
No.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.468
You may not want it.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.222
We both know that you need it.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.481
I'm sorry.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.301
You should have third-degree burns.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.014
Well, I don't.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.143
I bet a strong acid could do it.

10:43.977 --> 10:44.978
Excuse me?

10:45.562 --> 10:46.896
You ever have it tested?

10:47.647 --> 10:51.359
Uh, I've had more than enough tests
to last me a lifetime. Thank you.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.237
I have never met anyone
that can do what you do.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.740
Yes, you have.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.786
You were lying
when I came by Mother's Touch.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.584
About a lot of things.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.672
- Tell me what you know about Bushmaster.
- You know why I can't.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.675
My mother doesn't want
me talking to anybody.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.010
Especially here.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.680
Man, look. I just...

11:21.472 --> 11:23.433
I just want things
to go back to being normal.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.768
With her, there is no normal.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.396
Only what's next.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.321
He never turned in your paperwork

12:18.404 --> 12:20.490
or anything else.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.284
We had a pool
when you turned your badge in.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.373
Ridenhour gave you a month
before you came begging for it back.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.625
Bailey gave you a week.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.294
I said three days.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.672
'Cause they don't know you like I do.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.510
Coach Shaw used to have
to pull you off the court

12:40.593 --> 12:41.678
even when you were injured.

12:42.887 --> 12:43.888
You never quit.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.064
Ridenhour was a house cat.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.858
He should never have been out there.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.278
Inspector West called.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.323
Callahan is in Maui,
and O'Reilly moved to New Orleans.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.700
And none of them know you quit.

13:05.368 --> 13:09.497
West said until One Police Plaza
sends somebody else,

13:09.580 --> 13:11.582
you're the highest ranking detective here.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.793
You're in charge.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.422
You still on the job?

13:18.923 --> 13:19.924
Yeah.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.801
I am.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.180
I tell you this much, if it was me
on the ground laying in chalk,

13:26.264 --> 13:28.307
I would want you to catch my body.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.685
Wow.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.939
Now, that is probably the nicest thing
you have ever said to me.

13:37.775 --> 13:41.112
We're gonna find out who pulled
the trigger and make Mariah pay.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.281
You know she's behind this, right?

13:43.364 --> 13:47.785
We can't make assumptions about guilt.
Okay? We have to follow the evidence.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.829
You sound like Ridenhour already.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.123
I have to consider both sides.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.833
It comes with the job.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.835
No matter how I feel about it personally.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.756
Hey, Misty. Come on, Nandi.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.966
We need to inform
the kin of the other victim.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.885
- Okay.
- Uh...

14:04.761 --> 14:07.096
What did his name come back as?

14:08.556 --> 14:09.766
Darius Jones.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.143
Aka Comanche.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.939
"Comanche."
Where do I know that name from?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.108
Wait.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.237
You said it. That night in your sleep.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.991
When we had... coffee.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.661
Him and Shades were thick as thieves
back at Seagate.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.829
Their beatdown is the reason

14:31.913 --> 14:34.624
I ended up in Dr. Burstein's tank
in the first place.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.583
Damn.

14:36.167 --> 14:40.129
- Have you seen Comanche since Seagate?
- Yeah. Harlem's Paradise.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.508
Same night Claire took photos
of Arturo Rey, Nigel and Cockroach.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.220
Well, then Comanche
had to be Ridenhour's snitch.

14:47.804 --> 14:52.225
Do the math.
He had to know where to meet Ridenhour.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.186
I mean, matching text messages
and cell phone records

14:55.269 --> 14:56.813
are gonna be a mere formality.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.774
Comanche might have been
Ridenhour's mole from jump.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.360
Did Ridenhour have recordings, notes?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.862
We don't know yet.

15:04.946 --> 15:09.242
But them being murdered at the same time
proves motive on Mariah's part.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.161
So who put the work in? Shades?

15:12.245 --> 15:13.454
Who else?

15:13.538 --> 15:17.959
I still haven't forgotten the last time me
and Mr. Alvarez tussled in the basement.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.962
After I got shot. Punk ass.

15:21.045 --> 15:24.590
He usually puts a wall up around her.
Somehow Bushmaster got through it.

15:24.674 --> 15:29.053
What proof do we have?
Did she give you anything that I can use?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.263
Please.

15:34.308 --> 15:38.271
- You think you can get her to talk?
- Why don't you put her in Interrogation 2?

15:38.896 --> 15:40.022
That's more your style.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.067
Yeah.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.654
Everything is off.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.741
Police captain gets murdered.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.702
This place isn't filled
to the brim with brass?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.788
They laying in the cut.
They don't like the optics.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.914
Exactly.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.543
Ridenhour ran Comanche as a CI off books.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.879
They're worried about a Scarfe sequel.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.881
Makes your life a lot harder.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.216
Which is why I need you.

16:07.300 --> 16:12.472
Look, I have to focus on Ridenhour's body,
but I can't take my eye off Bushmaster.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.476
And I don't have time for lawyer BS.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.938
Can you help me, unofficially?

16:21.647 --> 16:24.025
Sure, as long as I can do things my way.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.153
If you can get Tilda
to link any of this to Bushmaster,

16:27.236 --> 16:30.031
you can do it whatever way you want.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.700
I'll take a shot.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.995
We'd better hurry.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.206
If Bushmaster finds out
they're still alive,

16:38.289 --> 16:41.542
- he's gonna come after them.
- That's exactly what I'm hoping for.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.794
Something to scare Mariah's ass
to her senses.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.652
What was built
by the father now belongs to the son.

17:08.611 --> 17:12.073
What's your plan for Harlem's Paradise,
now that it's yours?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.534
It's all for the people and the kids.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.285
Every dollar we make,

17:16.368 --> 17:20.248
every penny goes back home to the youth
to ease the suffering there.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.540
Hmm.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.297
If only my mother could have been here
to see this.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.260
You burned that woman and her daughter
alive in their house.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.388
Gwen would be proud of what you have.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.807
But not how you got it.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.810
I fear the darkness consumes you.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.186
Anansi...

17:43.688 --> 17:45.189
I only did what she did to me.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.116
Well...

17:55.199 --> 17:56.576
What do you want?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.537
Mariah and her daughter...

18:00.454 --> 18:01.455
they been seen.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.792
- Where?
- The precinct.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.544
Babylon.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.379
How?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.090
Luke Cage.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.428
Go! Go!

18:31.944 --> 18:33.112
Mind if I join you?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.497
I owe my life to some guy I barely know.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.541
Wow.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.751
"Some guy"?

18:47.918 --> 18:49.629
I just pulled you from a burning building.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.591
I think I deserve some props for that.
Don't you?

18:56.135 --> 18:59.096
So if there's anything
you wanna say or tell me...

19:00.306 --> 19:01.307
I'm here.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.768
What happened?

19:04.769 --> 19:06.854
<i>It was a home invasion.</i>

19:07.396 --> 19:09.940
I remind you, I'm the victim here.

19:10.024 --> 19:14.654
You have been untouchable on that block
for decades. I don't buy it.

19:14.737 --> 19:20.493
You know these young bloods. No respect.
Absolutely no home training.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.412
Fine. What did they look like?

19:24.538 --> 19:25.539
They both...

19:26.707 --> 19:27.833
had masks.

19:27.917 --> 19:28.918
Both?

19:29.794 --> 19:31.796
Your daughter said
there were three of them.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.297
When did you talk to Tilda?

19:34.757 --> 19:39.345
He just walked right in, and Mother
lifted her gun and she shot him.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.391
- The bullets bounce off?
- No. Not like you.

19:44.892 --> 19:48.771
They hit. Like, directly.
It had no effect on him.

19:49.647 --> 19:50.606
What'd he say?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.026
He was talking about how the Stokes family
ruined his life.

19:54.110 --> 19:58.572
They killed his father and his mother,
all over some Bushmaster Rum.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.368
If they wanted you dead,
why not just shoot you?

20:02.451 --> 20:06.205
Throw you out of a window?
Or bash your head in with a mic stand?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.498
Excuse me?

20:07.581 --> 20:09.583
Petty thieves keep it petty.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.627
So do petty detectives.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.089
We both know damn well who did this.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.008
Probably the same person
who killed Piranha Jones

20:18.092 --> 20:22.388
and may well have
every ill-gotten dime you have ever made.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.640
Say his name, Mariah.

20:25.307 --> 20:29.854
Before this jerk-flavored Hatfield
and McCoy shit gets more people killed

20:29.937 --> 20:32.231
and you end up a Popsicle.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.568
Oh, this is some bullshit.
Get Thomas Ridenhour in here right now...

20:35.651 --> 20:38.112
Don't you dare say his name
like he is walking in here.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.781
He's behind the window. I know that.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.536
At the same time your brownstone
was being burned down,

20:45.619 --> 20:48.330
Thomas Ridenhour was shot and killed.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.874
Ah! No!

20:58.466 --> 21:01.093
He was meeting
with a confidential informant.

21:01.802 --> 21:06.056
Now, this brother, he was busy, too,
'cause he worked for you as well.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.811
I hardly knew... what's his name?

21:10.895 --> 21:14.523
Darius. Street name, Comanche?

21:15.316 --> 21:18.360
Now, he was real good friends
with your boyfriend, Shades.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.572
You think Shades knew
that Comanche was a rat?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.074
Or is he part rodent, too?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.286
Listen, sweetheart,

21:27.369 --> 21:30.790
you wanna change the narrative
while the music is still playing?

21:31.624 --> 21:34.919
Or you can let somebody else
stop the music with the truth,

21:35.878 --> 21:37.963
and your ass will be left without a seat.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.550
Councilwoman, not another word.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.802
Fine by me.

21:42.885 --> 21:45.721
Crip Raggedy Ann here
was getting on my last nerve.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.141
Your client is withholding information.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.937
No, she's a victim who,
despite compelling danger,

21:53.521 --> 21:55.272
offered full cooperation.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.357
Do you have a charge?

21:57.525 --> 21:58.692
No.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.946
Ms. Dillard, you can leave.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.158
Uh, Mr. Alvarez...

22:06.242 --> 22:07.868
we ran your plates,

22:07.952 --> 22:11.664
and you were in the vicinity of the crime
and are now a suspect.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.374
That's thin as hell, and you know it.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.668
Mr. Alvarez has nothing
to do with this, either.

22:15.751 --> 22:20.297
Mr. Alvarez is a person of interest
in the murder of Thomas Ridenhour.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.508
He was friends with the other victim

22:22.591 --> 22:26.011
and was spotted 30 blocks
from the murder scene.

22:26.095 --> 22:29.473
We'll see what Mariah's fawn
has to say for himself.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.310
The hell's a fawn?

22:34.853 --> 22:36.063
A baby deer.

22:37.314 --> 22:41.360
I read somewhere
that cougars like to prey on fawns.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.618
He came to my shop for some special herbs.

22:51.620 --> 22:55.749
Did you give him something rare?
Something special?

23:00.713 --> 23:03.465
Hey, Mommy. You okay?

23:03.924 --> 23:05.885
Girl, I'm fine.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.598
So is he.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.559
We don't mess with the help.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.269
Didn't stop you with Shades.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.773
Where that little girlfriend of yours?
The nurse.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.944
I told you never to say her name again.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.613
I ain't say her name.

23:26.739 --> 23:31.076
He got a temper on him, too.
Bet you run her off.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.120
You can leave.

23:34.288 --> 23:37.291
We waiting for Shades, then we will go.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.919
Yeah? Where you gonna go?

23:42.046 --> 23:44.006
Wherever I goddamn well please.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.638
Ridenhour was surprised
by Comanche's shot.

23:54.516 --> 23:57.269
The bullet hit him in the chest.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.982
And he died almost instantly.

24:10.324 --> 24:13.786
But then Comanche was surprised, too.

24:19.625 --> 24:25.422
There's no way Captain Ridenhour,
with his life draining so quickly,

24:26.298 --> 24:28.884
could've hit Comanche dead center mass.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.221
He wouldn't have had the arm strength.

24:33.222 --> 24:37.851
Now, the second shot,
the one that actually killed Comanche,

24:37.935 --> 24:40.437
was a finishing shot from above.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.613
That came from Ridenhour's gun, too. Sure.

24:49.697 --> 24:53.450
But he couldn't have pulled the trigger.
Somebody else did that.

24:54.284 --> 24:57.413
Someone too emotional
to think things through.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.586
What were Comanche's last words?

25:05.254 --> 25:07.923
Did he admit he was a snitch?

25:08.799 --> 25:11.760
Did he beg for his life?

25:12.469 --> 25:19.059
Or was it one last emotional salvo
at the friend who betrayed him?

25:21.311 --> 25:24.231
Wonderful performance. Two-handed.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.817
I only deal in nonfiction.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.528
It's outlandish and full of hearsay.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.031
Make sure you don't break
my client's sunglasses. They're expensive.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.120
Can your client account
for his whereabouts last night?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.621
Of course he can.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.958
Well? Now, be careful.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.712
Traffic cams clocked him
within a mile radius of the crime scene

25:46.795 --> 25:48.213
both before and after.

25:48.297 --> 25:53.010
Did he appear on those cams,
or did he just park his car elsewhere?

25:54.428 --> 25:55.929
You have nothing.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.308
And, as usual, wasted my time,

25:59.391 --> 26:02.519
valuable and billable though it is.

26:02.603 --> 26:03.854
Let me take this outside.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.522
Not a word, Hernan.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.279
Don't you ever get tired of this shit?

26:12.362 --> 26:14.323
I can ask you the same thing.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.077
I'll be outta here in time
to watch the Yankees' doubleheader.

26:23.081 --> 26:27.669
I am no longer representing Mr. Alvarez.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.131
Good luck to you, sir.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.633
What?

26:34.009 --> 26:35.010
Hey.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.891
I don't think he's coming back.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.684
Hov was wrong.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.355
Players can change in the ninth inning.

26:49.358 --> 26:54.404
Mariah is not going down
for a cop killing.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.281
And a captain at that.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.493
Your trial will be a mere formality.

26:59.576 --> 27:04.081
I mean, with your record,
you will go to prison forever.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.549
The nightshade makes me strong, not weak.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.844
It's like a steroid.
Your body can't handle too much.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.428
It's a risk I have to take, yeah?

27:18.512 --> 27:20.639
Why? You won.

27:21.348 --> 27:24.685
You got everything. Mariah's house burned
and you have her club.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.270
But she no burn.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.106
I want to smell her flesh.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.859
I want to make her return
back to the essence, yeah?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.903
Your crusade is killing you.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.324
Stylers!

27:50.961 --> 27:53.338
No telling what Mariah
said in Babylon, yeah?

27:53.422 --> 27:55.173
What's the plan, mi dads?

27:55.257 --> 27:57.926
If she lives, part of the club
still belong to her.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.386
She can sue.

27:59.469 --> 28:03.348
I have all her money.
I have a top-ranking lawyer.

28:03.432 --> 28:07.436
There's a big difference between
what's legal and what's righteous.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.897
What about Luke Cage?

28:09.980 --> 28:11.648
Luke Cage owes me a death.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.359
I mean to reason with the man again,
you know.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.444
How will you do that?

28:16.278 --> 28:20.198
You take something he loves,
and you squeeze.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.870
Yes, I'll make it so.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.081
Mama Mabel put your ass
through law school.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.750
You don't get to quit.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.504
I was loyal to your money.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.632
And you no longer have it.

28:37.215 --> 28:41.011
Don't make this more sad
than it needs to be. It's just business.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.023
Trouble in paradise?

28:53.857 --> 28:54.983
Fall back, Cage.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.861
And I changed my mind about hiring you.

28:58.862 --> 29:02.115
You said you needed me, and you still do.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.660
Whether either one of us likes it or not.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.622
I'm keeping you alive
until Harlem is safe from Bushmaster.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.876
After that, you're on your own.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.046
Whatever, nigga. Come on, Tilda.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.141
Should we wait on Shades, Ms. Dillard?

29:29.601 --> 29:30.811
No. Come on.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.652
Get down!

29:47.577 --> 29:49.162
Who sent you?

29:49.246 --> 29:51.498
There's a bounty put
upon the Stokes woman's head.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.293
Her and her daughter, one mill each.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.838
I'm not the only one trying to get paid,
you know?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.006
Anybody else on that list?

29:59.089 --> 30:01.550
You and everyone close to ya.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.764
What the hell happened here?

30:09.474 --> 30:12.769
Another attempt on Mariah's life.
Bushmaster's behind it.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.064
If they'll shoot in front of a precinct,
no one in Harlem is safe.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.232
You're telling me.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.234
Let Misty know what happened.

30:19.860 --> 30:20.944
Where you going?

30:22.571 --> 30:23.572
To find Mariah.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.116
First, I got my own family to look after.

30:28.368 --> 30:33.957
We went to Times Square, and I stole
these <i>Top Gun</i> aviator sunglasses.

30:34.624 --> 30:39.004
And the shopkeeper came running after me,
and Che tackled him so I can get away.

30:41.173 --> 30:46.762
I wore those bunk-ass sunglasses every day
for a year, until they broke.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.265
That's how I got the name Shades.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.103
Comanche knew me before I was me.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.734
I lost my brother last night.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.364
- But you would never understand that.
- Then help me.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.909
Help me understand both of these deaths.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.661
Help me make sense of what's senseless.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.955
What did Comanche do? Did he slip up?

31:14.498 --> 31:15.874
Y'all were brothers.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.210
You're a crew, right?

31:19.169 --> 31:22.798
"Rivals. We ain't got none."

31:22.881 --> 31:26.259
Y'all were slightly ahead of my time,
but I remember hearing about Romeo.

31:26.968 --> 31:30.764
Zip was Romeo's son, right?

31:31.765 --> 31:34.601
Worked for Cottonmouth, Mariah.

31:35.602 --> 31:36.645
Yep.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.313
Zip's dead now, too.

31:42.776 --> 31:45.112
Anybody can die in this life.

31:45.195 --> 31:49.741
And more often than not, the person
that pulls the trigger isn't a stranger...

31:49.825 --> 31:50.867
he's a friend.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.121
You know a little something
about that life.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.416
Your boy Scarfe was about that life.

31:57.499 --> 32:01.253
Scarfe was emotional.
He had just lost his son.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.297
And it led him down a dark path.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.137
But what led you down this path?

32:14.099 --> 32:17.227
What led you to this?
Why did you kill your boy?

32:23.191 --> 32:26.570
- I didn't say I killed anybody.
- Then you did it for Mariah.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.613
She's not worth it.

32:30.157 --> 32:32.951
She's the one I want. Not you.

32:35.203 --> 32:38.748
- Make a deal. Save yourself.
- Mmm.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.712
I'm not saying one more word...

32:44.921 --> 32:46.798
until I get another lawyer.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.176
Fine. I get it.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.680
Comanche didn't mean shit to you.
He was just another thug.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.724
You don't know shit about him...

33:17.954 --> 33:21.124
I had him right where I wanted him.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.669
He had invoked counsel,
but he was still talking.

33:24.753 --> 33:28.757
He is completely out of pocket right now,
which is unlike him.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.717
This murder has him completely rattled.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.845
- We have bigger priorities right now.
- Like what?

33:33.929 --> 33:37.766
A Jamaican shooter just tried
to kill Mariah in front of the precinct.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.683
Did he do it?

33:38.767 --> 33:42.229
Luke Cage shielded her and she drove off.
She's in the wind for now.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.313
Damn it.

33:46.816 --> 33:50.487
The GSR test on Shades' hands
came back as negative.

33:50.570 --> 33:53.198
There's no nitrates,
no proof he ever even held a weapon.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.700
Maybe he wore gloves
and ditched his clothes.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.702
We still don't have PC
that'll hold up in court.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.704
- Bullshit, I don't.
- All we have is the car.

33:59.788 --> 34:03.333
What about cams, huh?
There are no cams anywhere?

34:03.416 --> 34:06.336
Ridenhour, on purpose,
picked a place with no video surveillance.

34:06.419 --> 34:07.837
Shit!

34:16.263 --> 34:17.389
You're free to go.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.603
Before you leave,
let me ask you something.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.399
- You haven't asked me enough questions?
- No.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.900
Not about your friend's murder.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.654
I'll let you stew on that for a while.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.242
I ask you this.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.619
Why would she abandon you?

34:41.371 --> 34:43.790
- You've been nothing but loyal to her.
- Stop it.

34:43.873 --> 34:44.708
I looked it up.

34:44.791 --> 34:48.753
Ben Donovan has been the lawyer
for the Stokes family for over 25 years.

34:48.837 --> 34:53.174
You think he drops you as a client
without her express say-so?

34:55.885 --> 34:58.054
Talk to me before she does.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.352
While you still have something to offer.

35:17.657 --> 35:18.533
Shit.

35:20.368 --> 35:25.790
Dad, you're not listening.
Somebody out there wants to hurt me.

35:25.874 --> 35:29.836
I thought that the bulletproof
was supposed to help all that.

35:29.919 --> 35:33.673
I'm not worried about me.
I'm worried about you.

35:33.757 --> 35:34.758
Son...

35:35.550 --> 35:39.512
"When the wicked,
even my enemies and my foes,

35:39.596 --> 35:44.726
came upon me to eat up my flesh,
they stumbled and fell."

35:46.227 --> 35:48.271
I got a whole book of those psalms, son.

35:48.355 --> 35:49.689
Dad, come on.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.609
It's my responsibility to protect you.
Let me.

35:52.692 --> 35:57.906
Well, if you're gonna protect me,
you're gonna have to do it from here.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.241
Pass those out.

36:32.899 --> 36:36.319
My wife is about your size.
Do you need any clothes?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.450
I'll be fine, big man.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.579
I'll be outside.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.766
God damn. The gun...

37:11.646 --> 37:14.941
Ah! Damn it.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.411
You don't look happy to see me.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.912
I'm not.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.794
All of this is because of you

37:34.878 --> 37:38.423
bringing that goddamn snitch
into our lives.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.718
I took care of that situation
as soon as I found out.

37:41.801 --> 37:46.181
Yeah. You went waltzing into the precinct,
knowing what you'd done?

37:46.264 --> 37:48.933
You have to live with your head
inside the lion's mouth.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.643
Never let them see you sweat.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.396
Oh, you wasn't even sweating.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.941
I bet you the snitch.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.943
- Me?
- Yeah.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.529
You killed Ridenhour and your boy.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.657
You can tell any story you want.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.452
Excuse me. Testing. One, two.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.790
- You abandoned me.
- I did not!

38:11.873 --> 38:14.292
That's why you pulled Ben Donovan.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.252
I was doing my best to stay afloat,

38:16.336 --> 38:19.047
because between killing Che
and losing you,

38:19.130 --> 38:20.507
I was reeling.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.258
I'm lucky I came out of there whole.

38:22.342 --> 38:26.054
I ain't done nothing!
Ben left on his own. He quit.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.348
- He quit?
- We can't pay him.

38:29.933 --> 38:30.934
"We"?

38:31.851 --> 38:32.852
Mmm...

38:33.812 --> 38:34.813
"We"?

38:36.815 --> 38:40.985
You are standing in ruins because of you.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.070
Excuse me?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.279
You heard me.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.533
I warned you.

38:46.616 --> 38:51.246
I told you in Harlem's Paradise
not to sell the gun business!

38:52.622 --> 38:56.292
It led to a domino effect
that led straight to Bushmaster.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.921
All you had to do
was sell that goddamn painting,

39:00.004 --> 39:02.674
and none of this would have happened!

39:02.757 --> 39:05.552
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Here.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.345
You scared?

39:08.096 --> 39:09.138
Yes.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.601
Yes, I'm scared. I got no home!

39:13.685 --> 39:15.854
I got no club!

39:15.937 --> 39:20.942
Bushmaster, cops, Luke Cage.
Everybody is up my ass!

39:21.025 --> 39:23.486
Yes, I'm scared, because it's over.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.321
What's over, huh?

39:26.072 --> 39:27.073
What's over?

39:28.700 --> 39:29.826
What are you gonna do?

39:32.829 --> 39:34.622
You gonna buy a little house upstate?

39:35.290 --> 39:36.624
Hmm?

39:36.708 --> 39:38.418
You gonna start a food truck?

39:40.628 --> 39:42.005
Look at me.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.799
The second you pushed Cornell
through that window,

39:44.883 --> 39:46.384
you became a gangster.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.888
And this ain't how gangsters do.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.019
How do gangsters do?

39:56.102 --> 39:57.228
They adapt.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.314
They boogie.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.026
Bushmaster thinks he's won.

40:03.693 --> 40:04.861
He's cocky.

40:06.487 --> 40:11.242
He'll let his guard down,
and that's when we come at what he loves.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.078
The same as he did for us.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.335
We can do this.

40:22.795 --> 40:23.796
Together.

40:24.839 --> 40:25.840
You and me.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.844
You are a queen.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.737
Mmm... mmm...

41:34.784 --> 41:36.619
Greetings, Officers.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.789
He's been waiting for you.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.308
Wah gwaan?

41:59.392 --> 42:01.102
Babylon's finest.

42:02.437 --> 42:03.730
This wah gwaan.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.983
I'm Detective Misty Knight,
and that's a search warrant.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.360
You put a bounty out on Mariah Dillard.

42:09.944 --> 42:13.031
Stokes. Mariah Stokes.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.534
And no, it's not true.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.912
What can we do for you, Detectives?

42:19.996 --> 42:21.247
God damn.

42:21.998 --> 42:24.709
You stole Mariah Dillard's attorney,
and now you got her club, too?

42:24.792 --> 42:27.503
My club. And my birthright, you know.

42:33.426 --> 42:37.263
That's my father.
He built this club with the Stokes.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.307
I came back to settle all claims.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.685
We've got two Stylers in custody
claiming there's a million-dollar bounty

42:42.769 --> 42:44.645
on Mariah and Tilda Dillard. Is that true?

42:44.729 --> 42:46.522
Stokes.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.608
And no, it's not true.

42:49.192 --> 42:51.069
And you can't prove otherwise.

42:51.778 --> 42:55.406
There's a lot of folks
losing their heads around here lately.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.618
And arms, too, apparently.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.833
There was a brownstone
that was burned last night in Harlem.

43:07.001 --> 43:10.588
Did that belong to your father, too?

43:10.671 --> 43:12.131
Had nothing to do with me.

43:12.215 --> 43:13.382
We don't believe you.

43:13.466 --> 43:15.134
You can believe whatever you want.

43:15.968 --> 43:20.306
But unless you have evidence,
there's nothing you can do about it.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.558
So go on, tear up the club.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.646
The only thing you're gonna discover
is what I already know.

43:26.729 --> 43:31.025
You have no power. I have the power.

43:31.692 --> 43:35.947
And I don't need a gun, a badge,
a plastic arm to use it, see?

43:37.115 --> 43:39.492
That's enough harassment
of my client today.

43:40.660 --> 43:41.911
Anything else?

43:57.593 --> 43:58.594
You okay?

43:59.095 --> 44:00.471
You can leave now, too.

44:26.831 --> 44:28.040
Calm down, Tilda.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.001
Just me.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.587
How did you get in here?

44:33.379 --> 44:38.050
I'm your mama. There is not a door
you have that I cannot unlock.

44:40.595 --> 44:44.098
- Where are you going?
- Knew I should have left a while ago.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.934
I'm sure you have
some other brownstone somewhere.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.519
I have nothing left.

44:48.603 --> 44:51.105
I borrowed these rags from Sugar's wife.

44:52.064 --> 44:55.067
Everything I have is gone. Except for you.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.987
I have nowhere else to go.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.156
No one I can trust.

45:01.574 --> 45:04.702
Yeah, well, I need to be
far away from you right now.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.163
I need to start fresh.

45:08.247 --> 45:11.167
It's dangerous being around somebody
that doesn't know who they really are.

45:12.126 --> 45:15.880
I know that you're all I have left.
I do know that much.

45:15.963 --> 45:18.966
You don't even have me. You never did.

45:19.634 --> 45:22.511
You tell the public one thing,
but the reality, oh, it's different.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.972
The day I was born,
you just tossed me away.

45:26.933 --> 45:28.976
I never tossed you away.

45:30.937 --> 45:35.149
I remember that day.
And every minute in it.

45:37.026 --> 45:39.445
Twenty-two hours of hard labor.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.741
Your ass almost killed me.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.537
But that wasn't the tough part.

45:53.084 --> 45:58.798
The toughest part... was holding
the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen,

45:58.881 --> 46:00.549
but just for a moment.

46:02.510 --> 46:07.348
I barely had time to fall in love with you
before Mama Mabel snatched you away.

46:16.065 --> 46:18.401
It broke my heart to lose you, Tilda.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.948
That's what was the worst part
of last night.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.283
I thought I was gonna lose you again.

46:28.703 --> 46:30.329
Mama Mabel sent me away?

46:32.373 --> 46:34.667
To our cousins, the Johnsons.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.796
Mamie had just lost her baby, so they...

46:40.506 --> 46:42.550
they were more than happy to claim you.

46:42.633 --> 46:46.178
You never told me
why I ended up at the Johnsons'.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.601
I remember Mamie Johnson.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.063
I used to call her Meemaw.

46:57.189 --> 47:00.735
That woman,
she was always there for me.

47:03.237 --> 47:05.072
But she made me keep a picture of you.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.411
"That's your mama."
That's what she would say to me.

47:12.621 --> 47:14.498
She always made sure I knew.

47:16.625 --> 47:18.127
You were always loved.

47:20.713 --> 47:22.548
And in spite of what you think...

47:25.092 --> 47:27.094
you were always in my heart.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.516
I do love you, sweetie.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.909
There's something
I think I should show you.

47:55.831 --> 47:57.458
Even if my men kill Mariah,

47:58.167 --> 48:00.503
I am the only one to take on Luke Cage.

48:01.337 --> 48:03.672
I need my strength and power, Anansi.

48:03.756 --> 48:04.715
It's all gone.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.008
I'll find more.

48:06.092 --> 48:07.093
How?

48:08.135 --> 48:10.596
I already took over
the ganja spots in the city.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.475
I'll use light and water.
I'll make the nightshade here.

48:14.558 --> 48:19.772
Impossible! You can't replicate the soil
and texture of the Blue Mountain, see?

48:19.855 --> 48:22.024
It comes from the root, not science.

48:22.108 --> 48:23.317
I'll make it work!

48:23.400 --> 48:25.236
It'll keep me strong.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.405
It will also poison your mind,
soul and spirit...

48:28.489 --> 48:30.199
- Anansi.
- ...as it already has.

48:30.282 --> 48:35.454
Listen to me. I need you here.
Help me finish what they started.

48:37.748 --> 48:38.833
No.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.586
I love you, Johnny, like me own son.

48:43.879 --> 48:45.131
But love has limits.

48:46.132 --> 48:48.134
Cho.

49:25.087 --> 49:29.758
This young brother here
may be an old soul,

49:30.342 --> 49:34.054
but let us remember
Jesus was a fully-grown man

49:34.138 --> 49:37.224
<i>when he was baptized by John the Baptist.</i>

49:37.808 --> 49:44.148
It is never too late
to walk the walk of salvation.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.442
- Mmm-hmm.
- It is never too late

49:46.525 --> 49:49.570
to ask forgiveness in the Lord's eyes.

49:49.653 --> 49:52.198
<i>It is never too late</i>

49:52.990 --> 49:57.036
<i>to press that, uh,
reset button and start over.</i>

49:57.119 --> 49:59.872
I'm gonna read from First Corinthians,

50:00.456 --> 50:02.875
verses one and two,

50:04.710 --> 50:08.255
"Moreover, brethren,
I would not that ye should be ignorant,

50:08.339 --> 50:13.135
how that all our fathers
were under the cloud,

50:13.219 --> 50:15.429
and all passed through the sea,

50:16.805 --> 50:22.895
and were all baptized unto Moses
in the cloud and in the sea."

50:22.978 --> 50:25.481
I now baptize you

50:25.564 --> 50:29.652
in the name of the Father, the Son...

50:29.735 --> 50:30.694
...and the Holy Spirit...

50:41.288 --> 50:43.499
Go! Get out! Move!

50:56.804 --> 50:58.806
Dad! Dad! That's enough, man!

50:58.889 --> 50:59.974
He shot you.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.100
Bullets bounce off, man.

51:01.183 --> 51:03.185
I don't care.
You can't be shooting my baby.

51:09.942 --> 51:11.068
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

51:11.151 --> 51:12.569
It's called nightshade?

51:12.653 --> 51:16.991
Yeah. I'm gonna need more time
to do some research to make sure, but...

51:17.074 --> 51:18.867
if I can figure out how Bushmaster

51:18.951 --> 51:21.036
combined nightshade
with these other elements,

51:21.120 --> 51:24.123
I think maybe I can create
something to counter it.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.084
Oh, this is ridiculous!

51:27.167 --> 51:30.963
- Shut your ass up and get down now!
- The Stylers are here.

51:31.046 --> 51:32.381
Bushmaster's goons?

52:21.305 --> 52:22.806
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.398
Units are on their way.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.108
Not waiting. Get us out of here now!

52:33.192 --> 52:34.360
Shut up, Mariah.

52:36.111 --> 52:38.947
Listen, we need to head
to the precinct now.

52:39.031 --> 52:42.493
They just hit the front of the precinct.
Trust me, they will be back.

52:42.576 --> 52:43.952
- Shit.
- You all right?

52:45.204 --> 52:46.914
Is any place safe that you could take us?

52:46.997 --> 52:50.000
There's no such thing as safe
when you're fighting this asshole.

52:51.085 --> 52:53.921
- Hey, Misty. You still got Danny's number?
- Yeah.

52:54.671 --> 52:55.672
Call him.

52:56.256 --> 52:57.341
We need a favor.

52:58.305 --> 53:04.814
