WEBVTT

00:08.200 --> 00:11.249
Hey, could we get one more round, please?

00:11.320 --> 00:13.049
It's on a tab, Bighetti.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.804
- Sure. Coming up.
- Cool. Thanks.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.690
Well, well, look who's the big shot.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.364
Yeah, big shot.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.489
How are you guys?
Everything good over at Nucleus?

00:22.560 --> 00:25.530
Nucleus is dog shit. How do you do it, man?

00:25.600 --> 00:29.810
You used to be the most useless guy
in the entire Nucleus team,

00:30.320 --> 00:32.322
but now you run an entire division.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.845
Did you ever ask yourself why?

00:33.920 --> 00:37.083
No. No, I never have.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.208
Do you have any skill at all

00:39.280 --> 00:41.851
other than magically
failing your way to the top?

00:42.240 --> 00:46.404
I have a boat. I guess
that's not really a skill.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.881
- Fucking Big Head, man.
- Fucking Big Head.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.126
Take care.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.921
Oh.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.571
Hey. Hey, you forgot your phone.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.449
At least, I think this is your...

01:01.200 --> 01:03.123
Holy shit.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.321
Holy shit.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.801
Right?

01:09.480 --> 01:12.563
- This is Nucleus?
- Yep.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.924
That is a beta of their
entire mobile platform,

01:16.160 --> 01:17.321
and it sucks.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.802
Yeah. I mean, the UX is, like, Soviet-era.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.884
When it stores photos,
they actually get larger.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.405
They never cracked middle-out.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.170
I actually kind of wish
you didn't show me this,

01:27.240 --> 01:30.722
because now
I know we totally would have beaten them.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.441
As it is now, I mean, we can't get funded.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.124
All of our new coders quit.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.129
I mean,
can you even imagine what would happen

01:37.240 --> 01:40.050
if, like, a tech blog
got their hands on that piece of shit?

01:40.320 --> 01:41.560
They'd tear it apart.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.008
I mean, it could actually
totally destroy Nucleus' release.

01:45.080 --> 01:49.290
I bet Gavin would do, shit, anything
to prevent that from happening, right?

01:49.360 --> 01:50.805
Yeah, totally.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.970
Jesus, Richard,
am I actually ahead of you on this?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.569
Take the phone, man.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.963
- It's yours. Take it.
- Are you serious?

02:01.040 --> 02:04.249
Yeah, dude. Come on, I owe you.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.485
I mean,
I was about to quit Hooli and move home.

02:09.039 --> 02:11.646
And then
Gavin promoted me just to spite you.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.122
And now, he keeps promoting me
for some inexplicable reason.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.283
I mean, I haven't done anything, Richard.
I mean, less than nothing.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.046
- Well, yeah.
- But look at me now.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.962
We're sitting on my boat, Richard,
and that's because of you.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.362
Soon, we can sail it to fucking Hawaii

02:31.720 --> 02:33.085
or Sausalito.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.083
Three more classes,
and I get my boat license.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.845
Really? How many classes does it take?

02:36.920 --> 02:39.207
Three. It's three classes.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.528
I heard you can pay somebody
to take the test for you,

02:41.640 --> 02:43.404
but I just haven't got around to it yet.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.603
Enough with
your coy bullshit, Richard, okay?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.091
I know you have my goddamn phone.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.083
What the fuck do I have
to do to get it back?

03:01.200 --> 03:05.125
Well, I was thinking
that in exchange for my help, you...

03:05.840 --> 03:07.171
I'm sorry, hold on.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.168
You can't use the term "in exchange."

03:10.240 --> 03:13.403
it implies causality.
That's basically extortion.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.326
Any actions he takes must be
un-coerced and of his own volition.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.441
Go.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.001
Hello. It's me again.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.285
I was thinking that if
you found your phone,

03:25.360 --> 03:28.842
you might be so happy
that you would be inclined

03:28.920 --> 03:31.571
- to drop the lawsuit.
- Why would I do that?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.968
Because if you found your phone,

03:34.040 --> 03:38.170
that would mean
that no tech bloggers or journalists did,

03:38.280 --> 03:44.083
and they couldn't write a scathing review
based on what was on it, as it sucks.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.729
Uh, who knows?
It might even cause Hooli stock to crash

03:48.960 --> 03:51.645
or certain careers to be ruined.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.769
Richard, are you threatening me?

03:54.120 --> 03:55.121
Uh...

03:55.200 --> 03:57.680
Am I threatening you?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.240
That's a good question.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.321
Um...

04:00.400 --> 04:01.765
No.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.650
If you don't give me my fucking phone back,
I'm gonna find you,

04:04.720 --> 04:08.691
bend you over your desk
and fuck you so hard, your front teeth...

04:10.120 --> 04:11.281
Hold on.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.524
You can't threaten them,
especially not sexually.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.762
This little shit
could cause major damage here.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.161
What am I allowed to say?

04:20.160 --> 04:23.004
- Richard, it's me again.
- Yes.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.485
Here's my concern.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.684
If my phone
ends up in the hands of a journalist,

04:27.840 --> 04:30.810
Palo Alto Chief of Police, Ed Gaskins,

04:30.880 --> 04:33.884
who, apropos of nothing, happens
to be a close personal friend of mine,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.685
would have to go and ask this person
where they got my phone.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.362
Keep in mind,
these aren't real journalists, Richard.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.885
They're tech journalists.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.210
Do you think they'd go to prison
to protect their source?

04:45.840 --> 04:47.001
I don't either.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.801
And since this phone's OS
is a stolen prototype

04:50.880 --> 04:56.603
worth $40 to $60 million, you're looking
at felony grand theft, Richard.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.202
You could go to jail for 40 years.

05:01.640 --> 05:05.884
Then again, you'd probably be fine
in a full-blown hard time penitentiary.

05:06.120 --> 05:10.011
I mean, after they waxed your rectum

05:10.120 --> 05:13.044
and knocked out all your front teeth
just to make things easier.

05:14.240 --> 05:19.849
You know, Gavin, if you don't want my help,
then I guess we'll just see what happens.

05:21.640 --> 05:26.771
All right, Richard. So, what do we do here?

05:27.400 --> 05:30.210
I don't know. What do we do here?

05:31.480 --> 05:32.481
Paul, are you there?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.602
- Ron?
- Hey, buddy,

05:34.680 --> 05:36.250
Sam and Melinda there, too?

05:36.320 --> 05:38.607
- They are. They say hi.
- Hey, Ron.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.131
What up, kids?

05:41.240 --> 05:44.687
Let me hit you back in 10
and we'll sidebar this.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.683
Binding arbitration? What's that?

05:50.760 --> 05:53.525
Well, it's like a trial,
but massively accelerated.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.604
Next week,
we're gonna go in front of a retired judge

05:56.680 --> 05:59.763
and argue our whole lawsuit in just
two days, and then we're done.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.162
So, this will all be resolved next week?

06:02.240 --> 06:04.891
I've always wanted to go
to binding arbitration.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.247
A weird thing to have always wanted to do.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.405
Everybody who's ever sued me
has settled out of court. Pussies.

06:11.920 --> 06:15.891
But now, finally, I'll be able to take
the stand, be a part of the big show.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.965
No show.
This is a serious legal proceeding, okay?

06:20.200 --> 06:23.010
And speaking to that,
Ron LaFlamme has got us a new litigator

06:23.080 --> 06:24.889
and we are meeting him in an hour.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.247
How are we gonna pay this person?

06:27.320 --> 06:32.008
Our guy has agreed to waive his entire fee
until our case is resolved.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.566
It's some wet-behind-the-ears noob
straight out of law school.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.645
No, he is said to be very experienced,
one of the best in the biz.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.889
Then why the fuck
would he take our case on spec?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.926
Was I in possession of
cocaine, amphetamines,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.049
amyl nitrate, also known as "poppers,"
at the time of my arrest?

06:48.120 --> 06:49.884
In large quantities.

06:49.960 --> 06:53.931
Did I have consensual intercourse
with two women under the age of 18?

06:54.800 --> 06:57.531
Repeatedly. I admit this.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.525
Did I violate the Mann Act and transport
them across state lines for sexual purposes?

07:01.960 --> 07:04.167
Alleged, but not proven.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.081
And, boy, they tried. They tried.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.731
Therefore, I was incarcerated
and I was disbarred.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.770
Wait, hold on. You were disbarred?

07:12.840 --> 07:14.410
So, you can't practice law?

07:14.800 --> 07:18.043
Not in open court in the State
of California. That's correct.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.690
But this is an arbitration.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.284
I'm really grateful for the opportunity.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.891
I'm turning my life around.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.366
I've served my time.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.725
Questions?

07:28.280 --> 07:33.810
I guess I have one at least.
What does amyl nitrate do?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.928
- Oh, it dilates the anus.
- That is accurate.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.725
Also produces euphoria.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.207
- Okay, thank you, Pete and Jared.
- Sure.

07:44.280 --> 07:48.126
Anal dilation aside,
what do you think of our case?

07:48.200 --> 07:51.647
You think we're gonna go in there and just
dick-slap those Hooli pieces of shit?

07:52.040 --> 07:56.364
I have reviewed your case
and it is extremely strong.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.766
Thank God.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.207
I do, every day of my life.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.369
It's only by his grace that I was able

08:02.720 --> 08:06.327
to survive that plunge into the ravine
and 11 months in a state penitentiary.

08:07.320 --> 08:12.167
I'm sorry, were you in an emotional ravine
or did you actually go into a ravine?

08:13.280 --> 08:14.281
Both.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.245
Now, with your approval,
I would like to move forward.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.126
I currently am not in
possession of an office,

08:21.200 --> 08:23.168
and I'm residing in a halfway house,

08:23.240 --> 08:26.449
so I would like to give Hooli Legal
your home address.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.527
Why?

08:27.600 --> 08:30.365
They need to send over
their discovery documents,

08:30.560 --> 08:31.561
all of them.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.683
All of them?

08:37.240 --> 08:39.163
This is craziness.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.049
Couldn't they have just emailed all this?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.851
I mean,
it's mostly just printed-out emails, anyway.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.610
Yeah, of course, they could have.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.480
And it would have been digitally
searchable, and that is the point.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.801
It's a classic document dump.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.202
But what they didn't take into account
is the power of us.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.805
So, grab a box, guys. Start pulling
anything you think is relevant.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.485
And you may have to work pretty hard,
but it will free us from this lawsuit.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.409
- Are you saying, "Work will set you free"?
- Yes.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.561
They have the manpower.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.041
We have the perseverance.
Triumph of the will.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.328
He's the most cheerful person
I've ever heard quote Hitler.

09:18.480 --> 09:23.441
So, Hooli's entire intellectual property
claim boils down to three simple questions.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.126
Did your work on Pied Piper
at any time overlap

09:26.200 --> 09:28.885
with your scope of work or Hooli business?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.086
Uh, no.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.288
Did you ever do work on Pied Piper
on Hooli time?

09:32.360 --> 09:33.361
No.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.011
And at no time
did you ever use Hooli equipment

09:36.080 --> 09:37.809
to develop Pied Piper in any way?

09:37.880 --> 09:39.166
No, never.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.001
We're on our way, then. You just tell that
honestly to the court, and we're home free.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.361
Okay.

09:44.440 --> 09:48.968
Unless, of course, you've offered
a conflicting version of that to anyone,

09:49.040 --> 09:53.125
a friend, your parents, girlfriend.

09:53.280 --> 09:58.684
No, no, and not possible. I haven't had
a girlfriend in, like, three years.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.161
Boyfriend?

10:00.240 --> 10:03.801
No. I'm not gay, just busy.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.123
- We're not litigating your sexuality.
- That's good, yeah.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.249
It's a good thing, too, because if we were,
we'd all end up in prison.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.526
Am I right?

10:11.880 --> 10:13.120
No offense.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.202
Here, I did a first pass.
Let me know what you think.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.963
Just a few questions for you to ask me
while I'm on the stand.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.929
It's rough clay. We can shape it as we go.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.844
You realize I have no intention of
ever putting you on the stand?

10:24.360 --> 10:25.691
What? Why not?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.321
Well, I just don't think
you have anything to offer the case.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.285
They're trying to say
that Pied Piper was created at Hooli,

10:31.400 --> 10:34.802
whereas I'm living proof
that it was created here in my incubator.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.247
I nurtured Richard like a little baby.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.890
I was his patron,
like the Borgias with Da Vinci.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.841
Actually, the Medici were Da Vinci's
patrons. The Borgias poisoned people.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.809
- Say "Medici" again.
- Medici.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.723
- Shut the fuck up.
- That's how you pronounce it.

10:50.800 --> 10:55.169
Let's be clear, okay? The burden of proof
falls on Hooli here. And they have none.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.210
You have a Barrett 50-caliber rifle
at your disposal

10:58.280 --> 11:01.090
that you can use to shoot Gavin Belson
in the goddamn face.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.246
And you're not gonna use it?
What kind of fucking attorney are you?

11:04.960 --> 11:07.725
Well, technically,
I can't refer to myself as an attorney

11:07.800 --> 11:11.486
until I'm reinstated and make
restitution to my victims' families.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.243
I'm a lawyer. And I'm a good one.

11:14.560 --> 11:18.121
And if you know one end
of a Barrett 50-cal from the other,

11:18.200 --> 11:19.486
I'll eat a bowl of shit.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.410
Did you get a taste
for that on the inside? Mmm?

11:38.600 --> 11:39.601
Hey, guys,

11:39.880 --> 11:44.169
it's been almost two weeks since the
mother condor has been to the nest.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.242
Do you think
something might be wrong with the egg?

11:46.520 --> 11:49.171
Something is. It's on our website.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.408
No, really. I mean...

11:51.520 --> 11:53.841
I think maybe I should call the museum,
see if this is normal.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.002
Jared, you want that egg
to be alive, right?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.241
- Of course.
- Well, right now,

11:57.360 --> 12:01.046
because you don't know whether it is
or not, it exists in both states,

12:01.120 --> 12:02.485
like Schrödinger's cat.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.881
Like what?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.724
It's a quantum mechanics thought experiment

12:05.800 --> 12:09.566
that an Austrian physicist came up with
to help understand quantum states.

12:09.640 --> 12:13.964
So, he imagined putting a cat into a box
with poisoned food.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.327
There's a 50/50 chance the cat eats it.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.050
That does sound rather Austrian.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.246
So, according to Schrödinger,

12:19.320 --> 12:22.563
if you open the box
and confirm that the cat is dead,

12:22.640 --> 12:25.291
then in a sense, you've killed the cat.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.170
Or if you call the museum
and get the information,

12:28.680 --> 12:30.045
then you've killed the egg.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.608
No, that's silly.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.165
Is it?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.490
Okay.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.721
I'm just gonna think about it for a minute.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.961
Richard.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.164
- Yeah?
- We have a problem.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.366
What's up?

12:48.440 --> 12:50.761
You and I are going into
arbitration tomorrow.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.443
I need you to look me right in the eye
and tell me why you've been lying to me.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.610
I haven't been lying to you.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.763
You told me you haven't had a
girlfriend for three years.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.489
I have found at least 15 emails
to Nelson Bighetti

13:03.560 --> 13:06.291
in the last year
where you reference a girlfriend.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.360
"Spent the day in bed with my girlfriend."

13:09.440 --> 13:12.444
"A homeless guy in the coffee shop
almost stole my girlfriend."

13:12.800 --> 13:15.007
It's a joke. Big Head and I,

13:15.080 --> 13:17.765
we call my laptop my girlfriend

13:17.840 --> 13:23.643
because it's the only warm thing
that's touched my crotch in a little while.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.249
So, when you said, quote,

13:29.240 --> 13:33.086
"My girlfriend shit the bed last night,"
that was your laptop?

13:33.160 --> 13:34.400
Laptop, yeah.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.688
Well, that's good to hear.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.251
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.248
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Now, listen to this.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.963
April 10th, 11:14 p.m.,
"Taking my girlfriend to the Apple store."

13:52.040 --> 13:55.931
April 12th, 3:42 p.m.,
"Picking my girlfriend up at the mall."

13:56.800 --> 13:57.801
Yeah, so?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.924
So, your laptop was in the shop
for three days, right?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.445
The 10th through the 12th, right?

14:02.720 --> 14:03.801
Yeah, and?

14:03.880 --> 14:06.963
April 11th, 2:48 p.m.,

14:07.040 --> 14:09.691
"Ran a test of
the perceptual modeler during lunch,

14:09.760 --> 14:12.843
"made a few tweaks and wow,
it's working on a whole new level."

14:12.920 --> 14:16.606
Yeah, that just means that it's going
great, that it's working really well.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.091
Richard, Richard,

14:18.560 --> 14:20.767
you didn't have your
laptop with you at Hooli.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.965
What computer did you use
to run that test that day?

14:25.800 --> 14:26.801
Oh...

14:26.880 --> 14:28.041
Shit.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.248
Richard, you didn't use a Hooli computer?

14:30.320 --> 14:32.971
Tell me that you didn't use
a Hooli fucking computer.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.169
I don't know. Yeah, yeah, okay.
Yes, I think I did.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.368
Fuck, I mean,
I just used it once, though, right?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.209
I mean, that's not a big deal.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.045
It's a huge deal. We're done. That's it.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.884
- What's it?
- God damn it.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.851
Well, under the law,
Hooli can lay claim to the underlying

14:47.920 --> 14:50.321
intellectual property
that makes up Pied Piper.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.131
So, we're fucked now, is that it?
We're totally fucked?

14:53.200 --> 14:56.682
Well, I mean, it all depends on
whether or not the attorneys at Hooli

14:56.760 --> 14:59.809
figure out that your
girlfriend is your laptop.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.769
Are you telling us this entire case

15:02.880 --> 15:05.531
hinges on people believing
that Richard had a girlfriend?

15:09.480 --> 15:11.562
We are fucked.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.201
All right, this is gonna
be a long two days,

15:26.560 --> 15:29.166
so let's try to keep things brief.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.567
Your Honor,
I think I can help speed things along.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.609
We are willing to concede

15:33.680 --> 15:36.889
to all the numerous counts
brought by Mr. Belson,

15:36.960 --> 15:40.726
except the ones regarding the ownership
of intellectual property.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.801
Is that right?

15:41.880 --> 15:44.087
On the non-solicit violation,

15:44.200 --> 15:48.330
my client is willing to concede
that Donald Dunn was improperly hired.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.571
And on the unjust enrichment charge,

15:52.720 --> 15:55.929
Richard will agree to repay Hooli

15:56.000 --> 15:59.447
$39 and 99 cents

15:59.640 --> 16:03.645
for the phone charger that he took home,
and so on.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.520
Thank you, Mr. Monahan,
for accelerating the process.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.567
Okay, let's start this. Plaintiff?

16:11.920 --> 16:13.649
Okay, Richard, here it goes.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.688
They call you first, we're toast.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.331
I think I'm gonna puke.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.291
Your Honor,
we'd like to call our first witness.

16:23.360 --> 16:28.491
We would like to call Nelson Bighetti,
AKA Big Head.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.084
Wait, are you sure?
'Cause it says "No Admittance"...

16:36.320 --> 16:38.766
Okay. Yeah, you were right. It's this one.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.291
Is that me?

16:42.360 --> 16:43.600
I'm sorry, Richard.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.244
Firstly, sir, let me say it is a privilege

16:49.400 --> 16:51.607
to be speaking to someone
as accomplished as you.

16:51.840 --> 16:52.841
Okay.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.969
You were one of the earliest members
of the Pied Piper team, were you not?

16:56.840 --> 16:59.844
And since your departure,
your rise has been meteoric.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.163
Haven't you received
three Hooli promotions in a month?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.761
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess that is right.

17:06.240 --> 17:11.087
It seems like everything you touch
is made dramatically better, Mr. Bighetti.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.324
You make a meaningful
and crucial contribution

17:14.800 --> 17:16.928
to everything you do, do you not?

17:18.160 --> 17:21.050
Wait. I'm sorry. Do I not?

17:21.839 --> 17:25.845
Are you asking if I do do that
or if I don't do that?

17:25.920 --> 17:29.641
This is amazing. They have nothing.
It's a desperate play.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.131
They're trying to build him up,

17:31.200 --> 17:33.407
make it seem like
he was a crucial part of Pied Piper.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.570
It's a Hail Mary. They have nothing.

17:35.640 --> 17:39.565
Because if I don't not do that,

17:39.640 --> 17:41.085
isn't that the same as...

17:41.160 --> 17:43.242
- Let's move on.
- Okay.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.607
Is it not true that Wired...

17:47.200 --> 17:48.929
I'll rephrase.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.528
Did Wired magazine run a cover
story on you? Yes or no?

17:53.960 --> 17:55.405
Oh, yes.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.847
That did happen, yes.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.211
I think I just made a mistake.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.606
That was the museum.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.680
I decided to call and check on the condor,

18:05.760 --> 18:10.322
and they said that it's very unlikely
that the condor egg is still alive.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.369
But my phone call itself

18:13.080 --> 18:14.969
drew their attention
to the low viewing numbers

18:15.040 --> 18:17.566
and they've decided
to take down the cameras today.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.402
So, by making the phone call,
you've most likely killed the condor egg.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.326
Oh, come on, I mean, that Schrödinger
stuff's all just theoretical.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.209
- It doesn't apply here.
- Doesn't it?

18:26.360 --> 18:27.600
I mean, look at Richard.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.684
He didn't know
that he had tested on a Hooli computer

18:30.760 --> 18:33.889
until Monahan
opened that box of emails, right?

18:34.040 --> 18:36.042
So, Richard was both innocent and guilty,

18:36.440 --> 18:41.571
but as soon as Monahan opened that box,
it made Richard guilty.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.284
But, I mean, by that logic,

18:43.360 --> 18:46.409
anyone who goes to an open-casket funeral
is a murderer.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.563
You are one dark motherfucker, Jared.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.961
So, Mr. Bighetti, you have stated

18:53.040 --> 18:58.649
that you didn't have
anything to do with Pied Piper.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.326
No.

19:00.400 --> 19:05.122
I suppose you'd also say that you had
nothing to do with Hooli XYZ either.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.641
No, not really.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.166
And what about
the Hooli AIDS and Cancer Societies,

19:09.240 --> 19:12.528
of which you were president?
Did you have anything to do with those?

19:12.760 --> 19:17.004
Honestly, not really. I actually remember
when they told me I got the AIDS thing,

19:17.080 --> 19:20.562
for just a second I thought they
were telling me that I had AIDS.

19:20.680 --> 19:25.208
But then I realized, no, I was just
the president of the AIDS thingy.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.568
But for a second, it was
pretty scary there.

19:28.680 --> 19:33.083
You see, Your Honor, Nelson Bighetti
is pathologically modest.

19:33.520 --> 19:37.002
While he humbly denies credit,
the record shows

19:37.080 --> 19:39.765
that he had everything
to do with all of these achievements.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.683
It may be possible
that Nelson actually believes

19:43.760 --> 19:46.366
he didn't have that much to do with
the founding of Pied Piper either.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.407
'Cause...

19:47.480 --> 19:51.610
But it is painfully obvious
that he had a huge hand in it.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.442
No further questions, Your Honor.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.609
May I say, Mr. Bighetti,

19:57.280 --> 20:01.763
how refreshing it is to finally
encounter someone in the tech community

20:01.840 --> 20:04.889
who is so free of pretension and ego?

20:07.680 --> 20:09.569
Well, that was troubling.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.926
Yeah, what was that?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.128
It's just that he scored big
points with the judge in there.

20:13.240 --> 20:17.165
So, what's our plan? Do we go in there
and cross the shit out of him?

20:17.320 --> 20:19.641
Tear him a new hole in his butt?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.324
Let's just remind ourselves here

20:21.440 --> 20:23.727
that he gave me the phone
and made this whole thing possible.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.325
So, let's take it easy on him.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.767
Yeah, I don't think shredding him
is the right way to go either.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.764
- Thank you.
- It could backfire, turn the judge against us.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.645
I have something else in mind.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.651
Mr. Bachman,
are you still prepared to testify?

20:38.280 --> 20:39.611
Fuck yes, I am.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.771
- Mr. Bachman.
- Yes, sir?

20:43.840 --> 20:46.923
You are the owner and sole proprietor

20:47.000 --> 20:49.401
of the Palo Alto-based Hacker Hostel

20:49.480 --> 20:53.690
in which Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Bighetti
both resided. Is that correct?

20:53.960 --> 20:56.327
Yes, sir. That is, in fact, correct.

20:57.160 --> 21:01.165
Uh, it has been called
the "Garden of Tech Eden."

21:01.640 --> 21:06.328
Is it also fair to say that every
instinct you have as a businessman

21:06.400 --> 21:08.448
has been completely and totally wrong?

21:08.520 --> 21:10.409
- Sorry, what?
- You hard of hearing, Mr. Bachman?

21:10.640 --> 21:13.086
- No, I've heard everything...
- Aren't you considered a joke in this town?

21:13.360 --> 21:15.761
I don't quite know
where you're going with this.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.129
Nor do I. Can you tell us
where you're headed here, Mr. Monahan?

21:20.200 --> 21:21.645
Your Honor, if you are to accept

21:21.720 --> 21:25.441
Hooli's reverence for Mr. Bighetti
as proof that he's a genius,

21:25.520 --> 21:26.965
then you must also accept

21:27.040 --> 21:31.443
Mr. Bachman's reverence for Mr. Bighetti
as proof that he's a moron.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.648
I'm simply establishing this type of logic,
Your Honor, cuts both ways.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.489
I see. I'll allow it.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.289
Really? Because I don't think "joke" is...

21:40.400 --> 21:42.129
Mr. Bachman, you have incubated

21:42.200 --> 21:47.047
a seemingly endless string
of patently unsuccessful apps, haven't you?

21:47.280 --> 21:49.442
No. No, that is not correct.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.650
I incubated Pied Piper. I
saw the value in that.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.645
Oh, did you? Isn't it true
that you were about to evict Mr. Hendricks

21:56.720 --> 21:58.802
until he became the
subject of a bidding war?

21:59.440 --> 22:00.487
You disliked Pied Piper.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.844
The one app in your hostel
that showed promise.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.650
Well, I think that's a bit harsh.
I mean, every...

22:05.760 --> 22:07.922
In fact, you tried to encourage Mr.
Hendricks

22:08.000 --> 22:12.449
to change his app to be more like
Mr. Bighetti's horrendous app

22:12.560 --> 22:14.562
called NipAlert. Isn't that true?

22:14.800 --> 22:17.201
Well, yes, I thought NipAlert
showed great promise. Yes.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.850
It did not show great promise.

22:18.920 --> 22:24.324
What it showed was the location
of nearby women possessing erect nipples.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.569
And as such,
Mr. Bighetti's grotesque creation

22:27.640 --> 22:32.601
was passed over by every investor
in this town except you

22:32.680 --> 22:34.045
because it was perverted.

22:34.280 --> 22:38.444
Well, I'll admit that...
I'll concede that the cultural moment

22:38.520 --> 22:40.124
may have passed, but at the time...

22:40.200 --> 22:43.488
No, at the time,
it was as misogynistic as it is now,

22:43.560 --> 22:44.971
wasn't it, Mr. Bachman?

22:45.760 --> 22:49.207
- It... Yes, it had some major problems...
- Some major problems?

22:49.360 --> 22:52.842
Mr. Bachman, a few moments ago,
you said that it showed great promise.

22:53.160 --> 22:56.448
You said that. I can have the court
reporter read it back to you, Mr. Bachman.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.369
I don't need her to read it back to me.
I can remember...

22:58.480 --> 23:02.724
NipAlert was poorly conceived
and riddled with bugs, wasn't it?

23:02.800 --> 23:04.370
Well, all apps in the beginning...

23:04.440 --> 23:07.887
Mr. Bachman, answer the question.
You liked NipAlert, and it was terrible.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.325
- No, I...
- Didn't you?

23:09.400 --> 23:12.244
- Liking an app...
- Mr. Bachman, you liked it, didn't you?

23:12.320 --> 23:15.130
Okay, yes, yes! Fine! Yes, I liked it.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.646
Even though it was a terrible app
and it had no market potential.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.961
I was high when he pitched it
and I like nipples...

23:20.040 --> 23:21.326
Thank you, Mr. Bachman.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.006
It was a buggy,
rapey piece of shit designed by an idiot.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.570
- Mr. Bachman, thank you very much.
- It sucked.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.484
It was so bad that the first time that
Richard tried to boot it up on his system,

23:28.560 --> 23:31.564
it crashed his laptop.
It was in the shop for three days.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.762
'Cause it was a piece of shit!

23:33.840 --> 23:35.968
Um... Uh...

23:37.000 --> 23:38.047
That...

23:39.520 --> 23:43.809
I mean, among other
things that weren't that

23:44.440 --> 23:46.090
were reasons why it was bad.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.446
No more questions, Your Honor.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.246
What the fuck is going on here?

23:52.520 --> 23:53.681
I don't know what happened.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.684
He got in my head.
It's a very uncharacteristic error.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.569
They're calling you next, Richard.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.683
They want you on the stand in 10 minutes.

24:04.320 --> 24:08.041
Great. So, they figured it out.
We're fucked, aren't we?

24:08.120 --> 24:09.610
It looks that way.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.365
Damn it, they're gonna
ask me if I ran a test of Pied Piper

24:12.440 --> 24:14.727
on a Hooli computer,
and I'm gonna have to say yes.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.925
What if you said no?

24:18.560 --> 24:19.800
What are you talking about?

24:19.880 --> 24:22.042
Are you saying I should lie on the stand,
or something?

24:22.120 --> 24:25.761
Gentlemen,
the less I know about this, the better.

24:25.840 --> 24:30.209
Well, then it appears we're in good hands,
because you don't seem to know shit.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.926
You're a mean and terrible attorney.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.646
I'm not an attorney.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.490
Richard, all they know

24:38.560 --> 24:42.246
is that you didn't have your laptop
when you ran that test,

24:42.320 --> 24:44.322
so just tell them that
you borrowed my laptop

24:44.400 --> 24:46.801
or you came home for lunch
and used my computer.

24:46.920 --> 24:50.003
Whatever you say, I'll get back on
the stand and then back you up.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.641
That would be committing perjury.
That would be lying under oath.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.321
If you don't lie, Richard, you lose.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.244
We lose everything.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.845
The company,

25:01.920 --> 25:05.606
90% of what could potentially be
a billion dollars...

25:05.680 --> 25:07.728
I mean, you know, because I have 10%.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.768
I know. God damn it, I know.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.286
Richard, do the right thing here.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.282
Lie on the stand.

25:15.880 --> 25:20.249
Mr. Hendricks, you are heterosexual, yes?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.050
Uh... Yes.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.487
How long has it been
since you were in a relationship

25:24.560 --> 25:26.528
with a woman, Mr. Hendricks?

25:26.600 --> 25:28.728
Two years? Three?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.082
Yeah, that sounds about right, I guess.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.765
You're under oath.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.930
Uh...

25:36.000 --> 25:37.331
longer.

25:37.400 --> 25:42.611
So, you've definitely had no girlfriend
in the past three years?

25:42.680 --> 25:45.923
This seems needlessly cruel. We all get it.

25:46.160 --> 25:51.041
Mr. Hendricks, when you refer to a
girlfriend in these emails to Mr. Bighetti,

25:51.120 --> 25:52.804
to what are you referring?

25:53.480 --> 25:54.561
MY laptop computer.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.246
The same laptop
that Mr. Bachman just told us

25:57.320 --> 26:00.210
was in the shop for three days

26:00.280 --> 26:03.489
from April 10th to the 12th of last year?

26:04.040 --> 26:06.327
Yes. Can we get to the point, please?

26:06.400 --> 26:09.563
Mr. Hendricks, did you at any time

26:09.640 --> 26:15.124
use a Hooli computer to test and/or alter
your Pied Piper algorithm?

26:18.280 --> 26:20.123
You're under oath.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.001
I just...

26:24.240 --> 26:29.406
I just wanted to be different.
I wanted Pied Piper to be different.

26:30.800 --> 26:34.088
But if this company is built on lies,

26:34.160 --> 26:37.289
then we're really
not much different than Hooli.

26:38.440 --> 26:41.728
The law says that I lose everything,

26:41.800 --> 26:44.201
my whole company,
everything that I worked for,

26:44.280 --> 26:48.410
because I used one Hooli computer

26:48.480 --> 26:50.289
to test and modify one block.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.804
Is that right? I mean, is that fair?

26:55.560 --> 26:57.847
To me, if the system says that's fair,

26:57.920 --> 27:01.641
then I guess
I'm probably not meant to be a part of it.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.200
Mr. Hendricks, please answer the question.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.370
Did you at any time use a Hooli computer...

27:07.440 --> 27:10.922
Yes. Yeah, I did. I made
a mistake and I did.

27:11.520 --> 27:16.128
I used a Hooli computer
to work on my algorithm, one time.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.443
And so, here you go.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.406
It's okay, Richard.
You don't have to protect me anymore.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.403
I'm his girlfriend.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.363
Sit down, Mr. Bachman.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.726
Judge, objection!

27:27.880 --> 27:30.645
I was the one
that was in the shop for those three days

27:30.720 --> 27:33.200
'cause he had hit it so hard,
I needed a doctor.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.086
Sit down, Mr. Bachman.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.490
Hey, has anyone
heard from Richard?

27:39.560 --> 27:42.404
Should I text him
to see how the arbitration's going?

27:42.480 --> 27:44.209
Uh... You can.

27:44.280 --> 27:47.921
But right now, it's going
both well and poorly.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.083
And if you get
definitive information back and it's bad,

27:51.160 --> 27:54.767
I could argue that you have effectively
caused us to lose the arbitration.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.249
Oh. He's taking it down.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.208
All right, I am unclipped.
If you're watching, I'm sorry.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.129
I'm gonna go ahead and leave this egg here.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.768
This camera does need to come down.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.569
That's good. He's leaving the egg.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.843
The bolts are all rusted out here.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.803
You should have never
called that museum, Jared.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.251
They're on there pretty good.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.965
Holy shit.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.129
Jared, you just killed that guy.

28:31.680 --> 28:35.241
I just got a text from Richard.
I'm not gonna read it.
