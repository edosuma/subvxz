WEBVTT

02:29.650 --> 02:32.084
If you're a leader, you lead the way.

02:32.444 --> 02:37.802
Not just on the easy ones.
You take the tough ones too.

02:38.242 --> 02:43.270
A good leader has to understand
the people that are under him...

02:43.747 --> 02:46.307
...understand their needs...

02:46.667 --> 02:49.739
...their desires or how they think
a little bit.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.523
He always made the right
decisions along the way.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.915
He was a real soldier.

02:56.260 --> 03:00.378
Some of the officers...

03:00.806 --> 03:04.003
I don't think I'd follow
them into water.

03:04.393 --> 03:08.068
But he was one of the best.

03:08.439 --> 03:14.116
He went right in there and he didn't...
He never thought of not being first...

03:14.612 --> 03:19.128
...or sending somebody in his place.

03:19.575 --> 03:22.328
I don't know how he survived.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.406
But he did.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.780
Lew? Wake up.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.870
They want us back at Regiment.

04:40.531 --> 04:44.444
Come on Nix, get up. Let's go.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.914
- Something's up.
- I'll be right down.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.645
- You got 10 minutes.
- Go away.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.912
Come on. Let's go.

04:54.253 --> 04:57.609
- Leave me alone.
- Okay.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.810
- Come on.
- Damn it!

05:02.636 --> 05:06.549
That's my own piss, for chrissake!

05:09.727 --> 05:12.844
Son of a bitch.

05:14.189 --> 05:19.627
We're the only unit that's got the
Germans on their side of the Rhine.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.498
If we'd taken Antwerp...

05:23.824 --> 05:28.022
...we'd be well-supplied
and have the Krauts on their heels.

05:28.412 --> 05:32.200
If I can just get Ike on the phone.
Are you listening?

05:32.583 --> 05:35.177
Hanging on every word.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.300
- Moose, you too?
- Yeah, Sink's not happy.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.689
Nixon, Heyliger.

05:44.261 --> 05:48.254
Colonel Dobie, British 1st Airborne.
Nixon is our S2.

05:48.641 --> 05:50.279
That's 1st Lt. Heyliger.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.752
The Brits lost 8000 men
when Market Garden fell...

05:54.146 --> 05:58.264
...which is why Colonel Dobie
has to coordinate a rescue...

05:58.692 --> 06:00.728
...for the troops who are trapped.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.588
Dutch Resistance are hiding
140 men...

06:03.948 --> 06:06.508
...outside a town
north of the river.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.176
They'll assemble in the woods.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.528
Pick a team and get them
across the Rhine.

06:12.915 --> 06:16.271
- 140 men?
- The Canadians have supplied six boats.

06:16.669 --> 06:20.423
The rendezvous point is landable.
I swam it last night.

06:20.839 --> 06:25.594
At 0030, they'll signal V for victory
with a hand-held red torch.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.930
That'd be a red flashlight.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.775
Operation Pegasus.
2nd Battalion is on the spot.

06:32.184 --> 06:36.814
Assist Colonel Dobie.
If you need anything, come to me.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.628
I can't ask for more.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.740
You didn't endorse
the Market Garden report...

06:43.112 --> 06:47.105
- ...or the TO&E. Why?
- I'll have them at CP 1300, sir.

06:47.533 --> 06:52.891
I want an inventory on material the
British 43rd left. Rations, supplies.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.521
Yes, sir.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.942
- Dick.
- Sir.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.200
I need your report
on that operation.

06:59.712 --> 07:02.784
- Yes, sir.
- Light a fire under it.

07:03.173 --> 07:07.724
We asked for this yesterday.
A day late and a dollar short.

07:08.137 --> 07:11.174
Enemy maps in the S2.
Let's look at that.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.948
There's 100 of them?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.572
This is it, boys.

07:30.910 --> 07:34.220
They have to get across the
river and over the dyke.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.617
- That's a lot to cover.
- Where do we go?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.719
You, Hashey? You get the penthouse.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.684
Thank you. We're up top.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.608
- How bad does it get?
- You'll find out.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.642
- That's a lot of ground.
- Couple of regular GI Joes.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.652
You said it.
Come on.

07:55.267 --> 07:59.818
New guys giving the replacements
the what-for and why-is.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.879
- I swear one of them has never shaved.
- Kids.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.392
This is a hell of a dog, Tab.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.448
- There you go.
- What'd you call it, Tab?

08:10.115 --> 08:15.269
- Trigger.
- That's good, I like that. Trigger.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.976
- Got anything?
- It's quiet.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.167
- Penetration!
- Alley's hurt!

08:20.501 --> 08:24.494
All right, get him on the table.
It's Alley.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.074
I got this.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.293
Alley, you're gonna be okay.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.584
- Get Doc Roe.
- Where am I? What happened?

08:31.929 --> 08:34.761
- Where was it?
- Crossroads.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.291
- It was because of your loud mouth!
- Back off!

08:38.686 --> 08:41.883
Send for Lieutenant Welsh.
Assemble a squad.

08:42.231 --> 08:45.940
1st Squad, on your feet!
Weapons and ammo only!

08:46.360 --> 08:47.998
Let's go, let's go!

08:48.279 --> 08:52.591
Get the boots off and elevate the leg.
Liebgott, use the sulfur.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.991
Let's get this done quickly.
We gotta move.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.363
Hey, Alley.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.476
Yeah.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.782
What are they shooting at?
What's down there?

09:45.127 --> 09:46.719
Headquarters.

09:47.004 --> 09:50.235
That's three miles away.
Why reveal position?

09:50.633 --> 09:54.751
- Not as smart as me and you?
- I'll check it out anyway.

09:55.596 --> 09:59.305
- Hold here. Wait for my signal.
- Yes, sir.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.301
Holding here.
I'm waiting for a signal.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.429
This is our fall back position.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.779
Mortars, deploy here.
1st Squad, on me.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.715
Go!

12:50.396 --> 12:53.308
Second on the right.

12:53.691 --> 12:56.251
First on the right.

12:58.529 --> 13:01.407
Third on the right.
Nail the machine gun.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.573
Second on the left.
First on the left.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.219
Wait for my signal.

13:07.538 --> 13:12.407
- Prepare to fire.
- Two rounds, ain't she quick?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.975
- Fall back!
- Fire.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.971
Fire!

14:09.391 --> 14:10.540
Higgins!

14:10.809 --> 14:14.324
Handful of Krauts,
on the dyke, 12 o'clock!

14:15.898 --> 14:18.810
- How many Krauts are left?
- I don't know.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.540
But we got seven in one blow.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.939
Bring on Boyle and Perconte. Go!

14:28.160 --> 14:29.354
Come on, fall back!

14:29.662 --> 14:31.778
Suppressing fire!

14:32.081 --> 14:34.117
Suppressing fire!

14:34.458 --> 14:37.575
Hashey, Garcia, follow me!

14:40.923 --> 14:45.075
Tell Peacock to bring the balance
of 1st Platoon!

14:45.511 --> 14:47.945
And another machine gun squad.

14:48.264 --> 14:52.974
Dukeman! Go get that machine gun
on the right flank. Go!

14:53.435 --> 14:55.027
Christenson!

14:56.355 --> 14:58.664
Fuck! Dukeman's down.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.863
Sir, the balance of 1st Platoon
is here.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.408
Gordon and More brought
another .30 cal.

15:25.134 --> 15:26.852
Sir?

15:29.888 --> 15:33.278
They're behind a solid embankment.
We're in a ditch.

15:33.684 --> 15:38.997
They can outflank us along the dyke
as soon as they figure it out.

15:40.274 --> 15:44.586
- How many Krauts are there?
- There's a ferry crossing here...

15:44.987 --> 15:47.660
...so it could be a whole battalion.

15:49.116 --> 15:53.029
Okay. What are your orders?

15:56.415 --> 15:58.929
We got no choice.

16:02.463 --> 16:05.773
Here. Talbert, you'll take
10 men along the dyke.

16:06.175 --> 16:10.851
Peacock, take 10 along the left flank.
I'll take 10 up the middle.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.141
Questions? Go.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.802
Enter.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.705
- I don't know why I'm still doing this.
- What, drinking?

16:48.259 --> 16:53.891
No, hiding it in your footlocker.
I'm a captain, for chrissake.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.339
Well, why don't you...?

16:56.684 --> 16:59.801
Why don't you just give it up?

17:00.187 --> 17:02.985
- Drinking?
- No.

17:03.357 --> 17:07.669
Hiding it in my footlocker.
You're a captain, for Pete's sake.

17:10.614 --> 17:13.731
Maybe this is the place
to stop drinking.

17:14.076 --> 17:17.910
Right here on the business end
of the Allied advance.

17:18.998 --> 17:20.909
Cheers.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.138
That's not literature,
just keep it simple.

17:42.521 --> 17:46.912
Try using the first person plural.
Say "we" a lot.

17:47.318 --> 17:49.468
Thanks for the tip.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.186
Fix bayonets.

18:01.749 --> 18:04.058
Go on the red smoke.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.789
No! Wait for the signal!

18:43.082 --> 18:44.231
Jesus.

19:39.638 --> 19:42.630
Come on, pour it on!
Shoot your targets!

19:43.892 --> 19:45.689
Let them have it!

19:50.024 --> 19:51.901
Come on, boys!

19:56.155 --> 19:57.304
Four.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.090
Five.

20:03.454 --> 20:05.570
Holy shit!

20:08.042 --> 20:12.320
- It's a whole other company!
- No shit!

20:21.764 --> 20:26.235
Easy Beaver to Easy Minor!
Reinforce Easy at phase one yellow!

20:26.685 --> 20:30.394
Plus one, strike three.
Fire concentration Charlie.

20:30.773 --> 20:33.810
Drop 200, left 100.

20:34.109 --> 20:38.944
Repeat, plus one, strike three!
Fire concentration Charlie.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.840
Drop 200, left 100!

20:42.409 --> 20:45.845
Krauts in the open!
Fire for effect! Over!

20:51.418 --> 20:54.455
- What's he saying?
- He says they're Polish.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.144
There are no Poles in the SS!

20:57.508 --> 20:59.066
Move!

21:00.552 --> 21:02.349
Jesus Christ!

21:07.017 --> 21:09.212
Oh, shit!

21:16.944 --> 21:21.654
- Send Lightning a report. Boyle!
- Lightning, Lightning. Over.

21:22.116 --> 21:24.755
Go up and spot the fall
of those rounds.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.679
Incoming rounds!

21:33.002 --> 21:35.675
Easy Company, take cover!

21:36.964 --> 21:40.161
- Boyle's hit!
- Jesus Christ, they got me!

21:40.509 --> 21:43.546
Take cover! It's German artillery!

21:45.389 --> 21:48.984
Get Boyle, he's down!
Come on, help me!

22:17.838 --> 22:20.750
Jesus, captain, they're SS.

22:32.478 --> 22:33.706
Joe?

22:34.438 --> 22:37.316
- Joe, knock it off.
- Goddamn it, what?

22:39.693 --> 22:41.092
- You're hit.
- I'm okay.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.713
Take these prisoners to CP,
and get cleaned up.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.470
Yes, sir.
Come on, Kraut boys.

22:47.785 --> 22:49.218
- Joe?
- Yeah.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.686
- Drop your ammo.
- What?

22:52.748 --> 22:55.546
- You kidding me?
- Give me your weapon.

22:59.129 --> 23:02.917
You have one round.
Johnny, how many prisoners are there?

23:03.300 --> 23:05.973
Got 11 right now, sir.

23:06.804 --> 23:12.959
Drop a prisoner, the rest'll jump you.
I want all prisoners alive.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.754
Yes, sir.

23:22.486 --> 23:26.957
"They got me." You believe that?
You believe I said that?

23:27.783 --> 23:30.581
- Can you make it back to CP?
- Yeah.

23:32.830 --> 23:35.264
I will see you someplace else.

23:36.542 --> 23:39.375
Take these to Battalion.

23:40.129 --> 23:42.199
- And split them up.
- Yes, sir.

23:49.597 --> 23:50.996
All right.

23:53.017 --> 23:54.530
Here you are.

23:55.269 --> 23:58.341
- We had them on the run.
- How's that?

23:58.689 --> 24:02.523
They were flooding back
when we hit them with artillery.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.456
It was a turkey shoot.

24:04.778 --> 24:08.566
They hit us with their 88s,
zeroed in on this crossroad.

24:08.991 --> 24:12.540
Now we were lucky, though.
Only 22 wounded.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.068
Lucky.

24:14.371 --> 24:16.566
- Captain Winters?
- Down there, sir.

24:16.916 --> 24:18.793
All right, carry on.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.728
All right, Krauts.

25:03.921 --> 25:06.754
Twenty-two wounded, huh?
You okay?

25:07.132 --> 25:09.600
- Yeah. One killed.
- Who?

25:09.969 --> 25:12.085
Dukeman.

25:13.639 --> 25:15.277
Dukeman.

25:18.811 --> 25:22.360
You're looking at
two full companies of SS.

25:22.731 --> 25:25.723
About 50 dead,
probably another 100 wounded.

25:26.068 --> 25:31.381
Seven back in the regimental cage,
plus a whole string of them up there.

25:31.991 --> 25:34.585
That's not bad for Dukeman.

25:35.327 --> 25:38.876
You got a drink? Of water?

25:43.669 --> 25:45.625
Yeah, that's water.

25:54.972 --> 25:56.451
Thanks.

26:14.283 --> 26:17.434
363rd Volksgrenadier hit Opheusden...

26:17.828 --> 26:21.582
...about the same time your SS
made a run for my CP.

26:21.957 --> 26:24.596
3rd Battalion got a beating.

26:24.960 --> 26:29.476
- Ollie Horton was killed.
- Major Horton's dead?

26:29.882 --> 26:35.559
They hit 2nd Battalion CP in force.
He was organizing the defense.

26:36.388 --> 26:39.346
Captain, excuse us just for a minute.

26:53.739 --> 26:56.776
How would you feel
about handling a battalion?

26:57.159 --> 26:58.387
Sir?

26:58.702 --> 27:03.571
You're XO of 2nd Battalion.
Colonel Strayer is...

27:04.041 --> 27:06.157
Well, he could use some help.

27:06.502 --> 27:09.016
I can handle them in the field.

27:09.380 --> 27:12.690
You're a solid tactician
and a good leader.

27:13.092 --> 27:15.686
Don't worry about administration.

27:24.144 --> 27:29.696
- Who will be taking over Easy, sir?
- Moose Heyliger can command Easy.

27:30.150 --> 27:33.028
- Heyliger would be my choice, sir.
- Good.

27:33.362 --> 27:36.991
You pack your gear and come on up
to Battalion CP.

27:40.995 --> 27:43.190
Like some coffee, sir?

27:43.872 --> 27:47.342
- Yeah. Thanks, doc.
- All right.

27:48.252 --> 27:52.245
Hey, Dick! You finish your novel yet?

27:52.923 --> 27:56.802
- That's a lot of homework.
- And I thought XO was a fun job.

27:57.219 --> 27:59.892
- Who are you?
- Zielinski, sir.

28:00.264 --> 28:04.303
- Who is he?
- Zielinski's my orderly.

28:05.894 --> 28:07.612
Rank has its privileges.

28:07.938 --> 28:11.977
- Orderly? I suppose you get coffee?
- Can do, sir.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.607
Black, no sugar.

28:14.904 --> 28:18.214
And a bacon sandwich. You?
Bacon sandwich!

28:18.616 --> 28:22.165
Give that to Colonel Sink.
With my compliments.

28:23.203 --> 28:27.754
All that for two pages?
Guess that's gonna take a while.

28:28.208 --> 28:30.642
Yeah, it is. You want a job?

28:31.003 --> 28:35.121
There it is. Wishes he were
back in charge of Easy.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.627
You just here to gloat?

28:37.968 --> 28:41.961
Just to rub it in.
Moose is leading his first mission.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.540
Operation Pegasus is set to go off.

28:45.935 --> 28:48.529
Pegasus. Yeah.

28:49.230 --> 28:52.188
Yeah, great.
Everybody know their job?

28:52.566 --> 28:56.798
We drilled with the boats.
Welsh and the Canadians are coming.

28:57.238 --> 29:00.310
- Dobie's good.
- How many times will you cross?

29:00.699 --> 29:03.691
If there are 140 Brits,
three trips.

29:04.078 --> 29:06.433
What time is jump-off?

29:06.789 --> 29:10.464
- We'll be ready at 0100.
- Speed is the key.

29:10.834 --> 29:13.428
- Keep moving and lead the way.
- Dick.

29:13.754 --> 29:16.552
Easy's in good hands.

29:16.924 --> 29:18.198
Yeah.

29:18.550 --> 29:23.101
- Yeah, right. Well, hang tough.
- I could say the same to you.

29:24.807 --> 29:27.719
- Good luck, Moose.
- Captain.

29:29.061 --> 29:34.818
- Are we sure on the intelligence?
- Well, I think it's pretty good.

29:35.276 --> 29:38.666
Is Easy walking into another
company of Germans?

29:39.071 --> 29:42.222
Why don't we ask Moose
when he gets back.

29:43.242 --> 29:44.994
Right, yeah.

29:45.327 --> 29:49.002
If they do run into any trouble,
you'll let me know?

29:49.373 --> 29:50.931
Yeah.

29:51.375 --> 29:55.527
You run into any bacon sandwich,
do the same, all right?

29:57.006 --> 29:58.359
Yeah.

30:28.537 --> 30:31.449
- Line secure, sir.
- Fall back into position.

30:31.832 --> 30:36.144
- I got the .30 cal. on the left flank.
- Extend it out 10 yards.

30:36.545 --> 30:39.537
So, colonel, where are they?

30:40.716 --> 30:41.944
- Leicester.
- Square.

30:42.259 --> 30:44.375
Come on in.

30:45.054 --> 30:47.124
- Welcome back.
- Good to be back.

30:47.431 --> 30:49.991
Heyliger. 506 of the 101st Airborne.

30:50.309 --> 30:52.618
I'm so glad to see a bloody Yank.

30:52.978 --> 30:57.847
- Your show, colonel.
- I'll be back shortly. Go!

30:59.902 --> 31:03.292
- Boats are all secure, sir.
- Bull!

31:04.490 --> 31:07.482
The Brits are on their way.
Pass the word.

31:10.746 --> 31:14.534
Sir, you missed a signature here.

31:23.175 --> 31:25.450
- Moose Heyliger.
- That's me, sir.

31:25.761 --> 31:29.595
- God bless you.
- We're ready. Where's the rest of you?

31:30.015 --> 31:32.131
I'll get them.

31:36.355 --> 31:40.394
- And here we all are.
- Well, let's go.

31:42.278 --> 31:46.430
- Wahai Mohammed!
- Wahai Mohammed!

31:46.824 --> 31:51.944
Moose and the American 101st have
done the Red Devils a great service.

31:52.413 --> 31:57.646
Making it possible for us to return
and fight the enemy another day.

31:58.919 --> 32:04.152
- To Easy Company, victory and Currahee!
- Currahee!

32:13.726 --> 32:17.605
I was CO only four months.
Before that, Meehan, Sobel.

32:20.232 --> 32:24.111
You were the only combat CO.
And I'm from another company.

32:24.528 --> 32:29.477
You know where they came from and
what they've been through. Hang tough.

32:29.909 --> 32:33.379
Train your new platoon leaders.
Trust your noncoms.

32:33.787 --> 32:35.937
- Halt!
- It's Moose!

32:36.582 --> 32:38.334
Hold your fire!

32:41.921 --> 32:43.877
Okay, buddy.

32:45.925 --> 32:48.155
Oh, my God.

32:48.510 --> 32:51.149
Send for Lieutenant Welsh.

32:51.639 --> 32:53.914
Stay awake on me, Moose.

32:54.266 --> 32:56.222
Send for Lieutenant Welsh!

32:56.685 --> 32:58.118
Okay, okay.

32:59.188 --> 33:03.386
I'm sorry, sir! I'm so sorry!
I didn't know. Jesus Christ!

33:03.776 --> 33:05.812
- Where are you from?
- Wyoming.

33:06.153 --> 33:08.144
You're a long way from home.

33:08.447 --> 33:10.677
- Stretcher!
- You give him morphine?

33:10.991 --> 33:14.142
- How much?
- Can't remember. Two, three Syrettes.

33:14.495 --> 33:18.010
- Were you trying to kill him?!
- I think it was two.

33:18.374 --> 33:21.172
It might be important
to know the dosage!

33:21.543 --> 33:24.501
I don't see one Syrette on his jacket!

33:24.880 --> 33:29.078
- He's a big man. Maybe he has a chance.
- We didn't know.

33:29.510 --> 33:33.423
You are officers, you are grownups,
you ought to know!

33:33.806 --> 33:36.604
All right, let's go! Come on, move it!

33:53.242 --> 33:57.997
- Once more.
- About face! Forward, march!

33:59.206 --> 34:03.518
Easy still has only 65 percent
strength, most are replacements...

34:03.961 --> 34:05.758
...including their new CO.

34:06.088 --> 34:07.601
How's Lt. Dike doing?

34:07.881 --> 34:10.793
The guys are calling him
"Foxhole Norman."

34:11.176 --> 34:17.445
They're talking mid-March action. Train
them 3 months, go into Berlin, end it.

34:18.141 --> 34:22.135
The only thing holding Easy together
is the NCOs.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.838
Sir, Sergeant Guarnere is here.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.909
- Look what just came in.
- The daredevil.

34:28.277 --> 34:30.268
- Hi, captain.
- Welcome back.

34:30.571 --> 34:35.246
- Never thought you'd be behind a desk.
- Someday, he'll sit behind it.

34:35.659 --> 34:39.572
I'm AWOL from the hospital.
Hope that won't cause trouble.

34:39.955 --> 34:43.914
- Would you care if it did?
- Not a bit, sir.

34:45.710 --> 34:50.068
Got a letter for you here from Moose.
Lieutenant Heyliger, sir.

34:50.507 --> 34:54.136
- He's recovering, but it'll be tough.
- Thanks, Bill.

34:55.471 --> 34:59.510
There's gonna be a football game?
Those guys in the 502nd?

34:59.892 --> 35:05.728
- Oh, yeah, Christmas Day.
- Great! Skytrain boys. Can't wait.

35:09.443 --> 35:11.115
Great.

35:14.573 --> 35:20.364
- Well, I'll just go find some trouble.
- You do that.

35:21.205 --> 35:23.002
- Hey, Bill?
- Sir.

35:23.290 --> 35:25.645
No more joy riding, right?

35:28.545 --> 35:33.903
Anybody ever heard
of a little joint called Lulu's?

35:34.551 --> 35:36.348
Got me.

35:37.054 --> 35:39.648
I'll just ask around.

35:47.064 --> 35:50.056
Well, I guess now is
as good a time as any.

35:50.401 --> 35:52.676
I don't wanna see another paper.

35:52.987 --> 35:57.265
General Taylor's in Washington.
General McAuliffe's in charge.

35:57.658 --> 36:03.688
- Sink is in Rheims to see Dietrich.
- Marlene Dietrich? I'm going to Rheims.

36:04.206 --> 36:07.357
Strayer will be in London
for another week.

36:07.751 --> 36:11.107
I'm heading to Aldbourne
to look up a young lady.

36:11.463 --> 36:15.342
- What are you telling me?
- You are headed to Paris.

36:15.718 --> 36:20.712
That's a 48-hour pass. It's been
decided you need a little civilization.

36:21.140 --> 36:22.732
Bon voyage.

36:27.688 --> 36:29.519
Second that.

36:47.458 --> 36:51.133
- I got two friends in the Airborne.
- Give me a break.

36:51.503 --> 36:53.778
We're all on the same side.

36:54.131 --> 36:58.204
- Marines?
- Marines are the toughest bunch going.

36:58.594 --> 37:00.266
- Marines?
- Wait a second.

37:00.596 --> 37:03.668
No, the Airborne is as tough
as they come.

37:04.016 --> 37:06.655
You should see the basic training.

37:07.019 --> 37:13.254
You know what I did in basic training?
I had to eat rats in basic training.

37:13.776 --> 37:16.415
Well, that's the first time...

40:59.793 --> 41:02.830
When I look at you,
I see eight or nine of you.

41:03.172 --> 41:06.323
- I'll be all right...
- "Look at me. I'm John Wayne.

41:06.675 --> 41:09.951
The costume department gave me
these Navy whites..."

41:10.304 --> 41:13.694
- Luz, shut up.
- I'm trying to watch this.

41:14.058 --> 41:17.607
- I've seen this film 13 times.
- I haven't, so shut up.

41:17.978 --> 41:20.492
- Watch the movie, fine.
- Skip!

41:20.856 --> 41:22.130
Come on!

41:22.399 --> 41:26.233
- Where you been?
- Well, I was at home in Tonawanda...

41:26.612 --> 41:29.570
...then Hitler started this,
so now I'm here.

41:29.907 --> 41:33.900
- How'd you make out in craps?
- Here's the $60 I borrowed.

41:34.286 --> 41:37.278
- You're paying me back?
- And a thank-you.

41:37.623 --> 41:39.614
- Surprising.
- A tip!

41:39.917 --> 41:42.112
- Jesus!
- Shut up!

41:42.419 --> 41:45.411
- Only $3600 left.
- What'll you do with that?

41:45.756 --> 41:48.873
- Blow most of it in Paris.
- Give me a tip.

41:49.218 --> 41:54.850
That climate doesn't agree with you.
I've been worried about your health.

41:55.307 --> 41:57.537
- Hey, Buck.
- You don't look well.

41:57.893 --> 42:03.047
How are you feeling?
Your wounds heal? All four of them?

42:05.109 --> 42:07.543
You seen this before?

42:09.530 --> 42:11.122
Buck.

42:12.616 --> 42:14.129
Hi.

42:14.451 --> 42:16.521
Is it any good?

42:18.289 --> 42:19.688
Yeah.

42:20.165 --> 42:22.554
It's a real corker.

42:33.721 --> 42:36.281
Lip, favorite part.

42:36.599 --> 42:38.555
"Got a penny?"

42:38.893 --> 42:41.532
"Got a penny?"

42:44.773 --> 42:47.048
"Got a penny?"

42:47.443 --> 42:49.673
- Got a penny?
- Sure.

42:50.029 --> 42:51.587
What?

42:55.200 --> 42:56.428
Quiet!

42:56.702 --> 42:59.455
- Come on.
- Quiet!

43:01.040 --> 43:03.270
I said, quiet!

43:03.584 --> 43:08.260
The 1st and the 6th SS Panzer Divisions
broke through in Ardennes.

43:08.672 --> 43:11.550
They overran the 28th Infantry
and the 4th.

43:11.884 --> 43:16.116
Officers, report to respective HQs.
All passes are canceled.

43:16.513 --> 43:20.472
Enlisted men, report to barracks
and your platoon leaders.

43:27.900 --> 43:31.336
- Damn, what a day.
- Unbelievable.

43:33.113 --> 43:34.944
Got a light?

43:36.492 --> 43:39.086
All right, there you go.

44:01.934 --> 44:05.051
Sir, have you seen Colonel Strayer?

44:05.396 --> 44:08.866
- Where's the company commander?
- Dike? I'm looking.

44:09.233 --> 44:12.828
How is it the 4th Army's problem
gets dumped on us?

44:13.195 --> 44:17.393
- Lieutenants. Captain Winters.
- Dike, I've been looking for you.

44:17.783 --> 44:22.174
We've a problem. Colonel Strayer
hasn't returned. You believe that?

44:22.580 --> 44:26.095
We're going to the front
and our CO isn't even here.

44:26.458 --> 44:32.169
You've a bigger problem. The men don't
have winter clothing or enough ammo.

44:32.673 --> 44:34.982
Take a canvass of the entire base.

44:35.301 --> 44:39.180
Get all materials before we roll out.
Have you done that?

44:39.555 --> 44:42.467
- No, sir.
- K rations. As many as you can find.

44:42.808 --> 44:44.639
We might not be resupplied.

44:44.977 --> 44:46.695
- And ammo?
- There's no more.

44:46.979 --> 44:50.767
Distribute it as best you can
so everybody has something.

44:51.442 --> 44:54.434
Inform Lieutenant Shames
of the situation.

44:54.820 --> 44:59.291
Get all your platoons as best equipped
as you can and report back.

45:00.117 --> 45:01.311
Captain.

45:24.725 --> 45:28.718
The blackout's not in effect.
Luftwaffe must be asleep.

45:29.104 --> 45:31.618
What a difference a day makes, huh?

45:34.068 --> 45:39.506
- Christ, I miss those C-47s.
- Got a tailgate jump here.

45:43.619 --> 45:46.008
Where are we going with no ammo?

45:46.330 --> 45:48.798
Hey, kid, what's your name again?

45:49.124 --> 45:53.800
- Suerth. Suerth Jr.
- Got any ammo, Junior?

45:54.213 --> 45:58.206
- Just what I'm carrying.
- What about socks? You got extra?

45:58.592 --> 46:01.584
- A pair.
- You need four, minimum.

46:01.971 --> 46:05.850
Feet, hands, neck, balls,
extra socks warms them all!

46:06.183 --> 46:09.812
We all remember that,
but we didn't remember the socks!

46:10.145 --> 46:12.739
- I want a cigarette.
- I want ammo and socks.

46:13.065 --> 46:16.501
- I bet Junior's got plenty of both.
- I don't.

46:16.902 --> 46:19.370
- How about a hat?
- You got extra ammo?

46:19.697 --> 46:23.167
- What about a coat?
- Shut up with the coat.

46:23.534 --> 46:25.923
- How about some smokes?
- I got that.

46:26.287 --> 46:29.120
- Now you're talking!
- Hook me up!

46:29.456 --> 46:32.209
Pass them down! Pass them down!

46:33.252 --> 46:35.129
Keep moving! Come on!

46:35.462 --> 46:37.817
- Go to the left!
- Keep coming!

46:39.341 --> 46:44.176
Keep it moving! All the way down!
Keep moving!

46:58.944 --> 47:02.573
All right, 15 minutes.
Smoke them if you got them.

47:04.199 --> 47:09.193
- Where the hell are we?
- We ain't in hell, it's too damn cold.

47:13.584 --> 47:16.974
Stand back, I been holding this
for the last hour!

47:17.880 --> 47:20.348
Anybody got any matches?

47:26.931 --> 47:30.241
Gather round, guys, gather round.

47:37.233 --> 47:39.747
Wait right here. Don't go anywhere.

47:40.110 --> 47:42.385
Welcome to Belgium.

47:42.738 --> 47:46.367
This area is Bastogne,
strategic crossroads town.

47:46.784 --> 47:52.142
Seven roads leading in, seven roads
leading out. Ideal for Kraut armor.

47:52.581 --> 47:56.290
Ike wants to make sure
they can't use those roads.

47:56.710 --> 48:00.464
We'll put a perimeter around Bastogne,
dig in tight.

48:00.881 --> 48:05.591
- 2nd Battalion will be placed here...
- Thank God. Barely made it.

48:06.053 --> 48:08.567
Better get yourself some ODs, Bob.

48:08.889 --> 48:12.199
1st Battalion's to the north.
3rd's in reserve.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.994
- Let's roll!
- We're short on ammo.

48:15.312 --> 48:17.507
- How short?
- Supply was limited.

48:17.815 --> 48:23.208
Captain, you beg, borrow or steal
ammo, but you defend this area.

48:34.498 --> 48:36.489
Jesus Christ!

48:40.796 --> 48:47.395
- Bill, Don, come here. Look at this.
- What? Hold on. Jesus, I'm done.

48:51.348 --> 48:53.179
What the...?

48:59.273 --> 49:03.903
- What the hell is going on?
- You're going the wrong way.

49:04.528 --> 49:06.120
Hey, pal. Hey, pal...

49:06.405 --> 49:09.317
What happened? Where are you going?

49:09.700 --> 49:13.375
They slaughtered us.
You gotta get out of here.

49:13.787 --> 49:16.699
- We just got here.
- Give me your ammo.

49:17.041 --> 49:21.637
- Take it. You'll need it.
- Go on, get out of here.

49:25.799 --> 49:27.994
Holy Christ.

49:29.887 --> 49:31.957
- Who's got ammo?
- Got ammo?

49:32.264 --> 49:37.019
Hold on, give me your ammo.
You got any grenades? Hand them over.

49:37.436 --> 49:40.633
- You got grenades?
- Thanks, buddy.

49:40.981 --> 49:44.132
Got any grenades?
Who's got grenades?

49:45.194 --> 49:47.583
Private, what do you got?

49:47.905 --> 49:50.135
Make a hole!

49:50.824 --> 49:55.739
Make a hole! Make a hole!
I got ammo! Grab what you can!

49:56.163 --> 49:59.553
Lieutenant, you're a godsend.
What's the situation?

49:59.917 --> 50:03.227
I heard you were coming.
There was an ammo dump.

50:03.587 --> 50:07.580
- Is it just you guys in the 101st?
- Looks like.

50:07.967 --> 50:09.923
- What hit you?
- Everything.

50:10.219 --> 50:12.813
The Krauts had Tigers, Panthers...

50:13.138 --> 50:17.529
...SPs, Stukas.
Arty and infantry just kept on coming.

50:18.227 --> 50:21.025
- What's your name?
- George Rice, 10th Armor.

50:21.355 --> 50:24.472
- Good work.
- Got any more mortar rounds, sir?

50:24.858 --> 50:28.009
I'll make another run,
but don't count on it.

50:28.404 --> 50:31.123
Thank you, sir.
I'll take this.

50:32.324 --> 50:35.919
A panzer division's
about to cut the road south.

50:36.537 --> 50:40.086
- Looks like you'll be surrounded.
- We're paratroopers...

50:40.499 --> 50:43.536
- ...we're supposed to be surrounded.
- Good luck.

50:43.836 --> 50:45.155
Thanks.
