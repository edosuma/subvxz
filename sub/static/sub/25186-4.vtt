Previously on Love Island...

00:22.800 --> 00:26.479
..relationships were on the rocks.
<font color="yellow">There is just something missing.</font>

00:26.480 --> 00:30.599
<font color="cyan">I haven't exactly been the best</font>
<font color="cyan">person to make you feel wanted.</font>

00:30.600 --> 00:33.239
<font color="#11FF11">She has given me absolutely nothing</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to work with.</font>

00:33.240 --> 00:36.959
As two new arrivals turn the
villa upside-down.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.960
<font color="yellow">You all right, boys?</font>

00:46.280 --> 00:48.000
Tonight...

00:49.120 --> 00:52.999
..the pressure builds in paradise.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.439
<font color="yellow">Did you just say,</font>
<font color="yellow">I have had it hard?</font>

00:56.440 --> 00:59.800
<font color="yellow">You've got to do</font>
<font color="yellow">what you want to do.</font>

01:00.880 --> 01:03.359
<font color="cyan">We're very vulnerable right now.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I know.</font>

01:03.360 --> 01:05.360
<font color="cyan">I think maybe we just swap.</font>

01:10.320 --> 01:11.999
<font color="yellow">If I am honest with you,</font>

01:12.000 --> 01:14.200
<font color="yellow">alarm bells are ringing</font>
<font color="yellow">in my head now.</font>

01:34.720 --> 01:38.199
Niall has just found out you lot are
sending him on a date

01:38.200 --> 01:41.759
with new arrival Georgia.
<font color="yellow">#GetChirpsIn.</font>

01:41.760 --> 01:46.919
And for Alex, the future
is suddenly looking Rosie.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.319
Her name is Rosie is what I mean.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.439
<font color="cyan">#TheDoctorWillSeeYouNow.</font>

01:51.440 --> 01:53.160
(CHEERING)

01:55.600 --> 01:58.079
So, where are the couples going?

01:58.080 --> 02:02.559
We called one of Majorca's top
Michelin-star restaurants...

02:02.560 --> 02:04.439
but they told us to do one,

02:04.440 --> 02:06.759
so it will be a bottle of Cava
in the car park.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.800
<font color="yellow">Cheers, babes.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah, let's cheers.</font>

02:11.400 --> 02:13.040
<font color="cyan">Just neck it back.</font>

02:21.040 --> 02:24.719
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>
<font color="cyan">Lovely meeting you.</font>

02:24.720 --> 02:26.639
<font color="yellow">Welcome to Love Island.</font>
<font color="cyan">Thank you.</font>

02:26.640 --> 02:29.279
<font color="yellow">Are you excited to be at the villa?</font>
<font color="cyan">Excited, nervous.</font>

02:29.280 --> 02:30.959
<font color="cyan">A mixture of emotions.</font>

02:30.960 --> 02:33.799
<font color="yellow">You are looking beautiful tonight.</font>
<font color="yellow">Gorgeous. </font><font color="cyan"> Thank you.</font>

02:33.800 --> 02:36.479
<font color="cyan">You look very smart yourself.</font>
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much.</font>

02:36.480 --> 02:39.359
<font color="cyan">What is your dream girl, then?</font>

02:39.360 --> 02:41.839
<font color="cyan">Dream, dream girl.</font>
<font color="cyan">Like, personality-wise.</font>

02:41.840 --> 02:44.919
<font color="yellow">My dream girl, personality-wise,</font>
<font color="yellow">is bubbly, fun...</font>

02:44.920 --> 02:50.359
<font color="yellow">Like you, you seem so bubbly.</font>
<font color="yellow">And up for a laugh.</font>

02:50.360 --> 02:54.319
<font color="yellow">Obviously yes, the fit,</font>
<font color="yellow">which obviously you are,</font>

02:54.320 --> 02:57.599
<font color="yellow">but like, just be fun and</font>
<font color="yellow">not take yourself seriously.</font>

02:57.600 --> 03:00.159
<font color="yellow">I can't be with someone</font>
<font color="yellow">who is like that. </font><font color="cyan"> Me neither.</font>

03:00.160 --> 03:03.359
<font color="#11FF11">Tell me about you and your history.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">How did you become a doctor?</font>

03:03.360 --> 03:06.879
<font color="yellow">When I was younger it was what</font>
<font color="yellow">I always wanted to do. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Amazing.</font>

03:06.880 --> 03:09.479
<font color="yellow">I went to med school</font>
<font color="yellow">and moved to London</font>

03:09.480 --> 03:11.239
<font color="yellow">and now working at an A&amp;E.</font>

03:11.240 --> 03:13.759
<font color="#11FF11">So you live in London?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I didn't know that. Amazing.</font>

03:13.760 --> 03:16.119
<font color="yellow">Where are you from?</font>
<font color="yellow">Tell me about yourself.</font>

03:16.120 --> 03:18.919
<font color="#11FF11">Well, I am from Wales.</font>

03:18.920 --> 03:21.200
<font color="yellow">All the best are, right?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Exactly.</font>

03:22.880 --> 03:25.639
<font color="#11FF11">I moved to Manchester</font>
<font color="#11FF11">four years ago.</font>

03:25.640 --> 03:27.599
<font color="yellow">Why did you move there?</font>
<font color="yellow">What reason?</font>

03:27.600 --> 03:30.399
<font color="#11FF11">I got offered a job there and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a training contact</font>

03:30.400 --> 03:33.599
<font color="#11FF11">to become a solicitor, so I thought</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I would take that. </font><font color="yellow"> Amazing.</font>

03:33.600 --> 03:36.359
<font color="yellow">That is sick. So you're a clever</font>
<font color="yellow">girl as well. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Oh, thank you.</font>

03:36.360 --> 03:38.039
<font color="yellow">Your parents would be proud.</font>

03:38.040 --> 03:40.559
<font color="yellow">Maybe both our parents</font>
<font color="yellow">would be proud. I hope so.</font>

03:40.560 --> 03:44.359
<font color="cyan">Like, I want to find out</font>
<font color="cyan">about you on this date. I do.</font>

03:44.360 --> 03:48.719
<font color="cyan">So tell me about yourself.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">OK, so... I'm a student.</font>

03:48.720 --> 03:51.479
<font color="cyan">Do you like chicken dippers?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yes, I do.</font>

03:51.480 --> 03:54.359
<font color="cyan">What else?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Favourite food, roast dinner.</font>

03:54.360 --> 03:56.439
<font color="#11FF11">I love a Sunday roast.</font>
<font color="cyan">Same.</font>

03:56.440 --> 03:58.519
<font color="#11FF11">Do you go to the gym?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What do you...?</font>

03:58.520 --> 04:03.079
<font color="#11FF11">No, I mean like... No! I have never</font>
<font color="#11FF11">been to a gym in my life.</font>

04:03.080 --> 04:04.759
<font color="cyan">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, you do.</font>

04:04.760 --> 04:07.519
<font color="#11FF11">Are you like a gym freak?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Do you go every week? Every day?</font>

04:07.520 --> 04:09.319
<font color="cyan">Do you think I look</font>
<font color="cyan">like a gym freak?</font>

04:09.320 --> 04:13.319
<font color="#11FF11">I've never been to the gym.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I couldn't go out with someone</font>
<font color="#11FF11">who was at the gym every day.</font>

04:13.320 --> 04:15.479
<font color="cyan">Thank God.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Babes, I couldn't.</font>

04:15.480 --> 04:17.759
<font color="cyan">It is just a bit much, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">A bit much.</font>

04:17.760 --> 04:20.358
<font color="cyan">Just chilling out with 15 abs</font>
<font color="cyan">knocking at your wazoo.</font>

04:20.360 --> 04:22.359
<font color="#11FF11">That would do my head in.</font>
<font color="cyan">Live a little!</font>

04:22.360 --> 04:24.279
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, live a little.</font>
<font color="cyan">Thank you!</font>

04:24.280 --> 04:28.119
<font color="cyan">Honestly, just live a little.</font>

04:28.120 --> 04:31.519
Georgia, if you are looking for a
guy who has never been to the gym,

04:31.520 --> 04:34.239
your dream and is currently sat
in a Spanish Portakabin

04:34.240 --> 04:36.519
sipping on a Mars bar smoothie.
Cheers.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.879
Anyway, over in the villa, the girls
are back from the terrace

04:39.880 --> 04:42.359
and Eyal can barely
contain his excitement.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.959
<font color="yellow">Hey, boys! </font><font color="cyan"> Here we go...</font>

04:45.960 --> 04:47.679
<font color="cyan">Is that Hayley and Dani?</font>

04:47.680 --> 04:50.679
<font color="cyan">She looks hot, though.</font>
<font color="cyan">She has done well.</font>

04:50.680 --> 04:53.959
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, Dani looks fit.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hayley looks hot.</font>

04:53.960 --> 04:59.159
<font color="yellow">You all right?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What did you think of them?</font>

04:59.160 --> 05:01.919
<font color="yellow">It sounded very interesting,</font>
<font color="yellow">the conversation.</font>

05:01.920 --> 05:04.239
<font color="#11FF11">What did you think of them?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Are they nice?</font>

05:04.240 --> 05:06.199
<font color="yellow">Yeah,</font>
<font color="yellow">they probably are really nice.</font>

05:06.200 --> 05:08.559
<font color="yellow">What is your opinion on them?</font>
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

05:08.560 --> 05:10.359
<font color="yellow">Why are you smirking?</font>

05:10.360 --> 05:12.479
<font color="#11FF11">I'm not smirking.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">No, they're all right.</font>

05:12.480 --> 05:14.159
<font color="yellow">I have got the right hump.</font>

05:14.160 --> 05:17.079
<font color="yellow">I know it sounds silly</font>
<font color="yellow">but I don't know why</font>

05:17.080 --> 05:18.999
<font color="yellow">we have to deal with it all.</font>

05:19.000 --> 05:21.799
<font color="yellow">Talk about lap it up</font>
<font color="yellow">in front of our faces.</font>

05:21.800 --> 05:24.279
<font color="cyan">What we want to know is...</font>
<font color="cyan">the handshake?</font>

05:24.280 --> 05:27.319
<font color="cyan">Like...</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What handshake?</font>

05:27.320 --> 05:31.399
<font color="cyan">Like you went, my options are open.</font>
<font color="yellow">No, he didn't say that.</font>

05:31.400 --> 05:35.239
<font color="yellow">He said, I've been friend zoned.</font>
<font color="yellow">That is what we handshaked.</font>

05:35.240 --> 05:36.919
<font color="yellow">That is what he said.</font>

05:36.920 --> 05:40.479
<font color="#11FF11">All you wanted to tell us is that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">we're friends, we're friends.</font>

05:40.480 --> 05:43.679
<font color="yellow">Listen, Dan, even though you said</font>
<font color="yellow">to me this morning what you said,</font>

05:43.680 --> 05:48.559
<font color="yellow">you ain't stupid, you know</font>
<font color="yellow">that I was bothered by it.</font>

05:48.560 --> 05:50.839
<font color="cyan">But I had a conversation with you</font>

05:50.840 --> 05:57.679
<font color="cyan">and you was like, I feel the same.</font>

05:57.680 --> 06:00.159
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to make myself</font>
<font color="yellow">feel good.</font>

06:00.160 --> 06:03.159
<font color="yellow">I was trying to make myself feel</font>
<font color="yellow">better. </font><font color="cyan"> You are interrupting.</font>

06:03.160 --> 06:06.519
<font color="yellow">Go on, then. </font><font color="cyan"> Be honest with me.</font>
<font color="cyan">All I want is honesty.</font>

06:06.520 --> 06:10.159
<font color="cyan">If you felt upset, I'd rather you</font>
<font color="cyan">turned around - </font><font color="yellow"> How can I say that?</font>

06:10.160 --> 06:13.439
<font color="cyan">Rather than go off and feel like</font>
<font color="cyan">shit. That is what I am here for.</font>

06:13.440 --> 06:15.879
<font color="cyan">We are in a couple</font>
<font color="cyan">to be honest with each other.</font>

06:15.880 --> 06:18.919
<font color="cyan">If you feel down, go, "Dan, I was</font>
<font color="cyan">gutted. I was upset."</font>

06:18.920 --> 06:21.039
<font color="cyan">Cos now I feel shit.</font>

06:21.040 --> 06:22.759
<font color="cyan">I definitely do think with Jack</font>

06:22.760 --> 06:24.919
<font color="cyan">there has been miscommunication</font>
<font color="cyan">going on.</font>

06:24.920 --> 06:27.079
<font color="cyan">I felt we was on</font>
<font color="cyan">the same sort of level.</font>

06:27.080 --> 06:29.879
<font color="cyan">He could have been just a little</font>
<font color="cyan">bit more honest with me,</font>

06:29.880 --> 06:32.839
<font color="cyan">even if at the end he wouldn't</font>
<font color="cyan">have got what he wanted out of it.</font>

06:32.840 --> 06:35.039
<font color="cyan">It made me feel a little</font>
<font color="cyan">bit shit in myself.</font>

06:35.040 --> 06:37.959
<font color="yellow">I was thinking of you a little bit</font>
<font color="yellow">because you'd have felt bad.</font>

06:37.960 --> 06:40.679
<font color="yellow">Someone might have come in and</font>
<font color="yellow">you might feel bad on me,</font>

06:40.680 --> 06:42.559
<font color="yellow">cos you are a nice person...</font>

06:42.560 --> 06:45.639
<font color="cyan">That's what I mean, I don't want</font>
<font color="cyan">to feel like a horrible person.</font>

06:45.640 --> 06:48.439
<font color="cyan">Speak to me about it.</font>
<font color="yellow">How is it fair for me to go to you,</font>

06:48.440 --> 06:52.239
<font color="yellow">'Oh, I am gutted about it'?</font>
<font color="yellow">It's moping.</font>

06:52.240 --> 06:54.119
<font color="yellow">I feel massively confused now.</font>

06:54.120 --> 06:56.279
<font color="yellow">At one point today</font>
<font color="yellow">I thought, you know what?</font>

06:56.280 --> 06:58.999
<font color="yellow">'She don't like me,</font>
<font color="yellow">let's just get on with it.'</font>

06:59.000 --> 07:01.719
<font color="yellow">But now with her saying</font>
<font color="yellow">'I want you to be like this...'</font>

07:01.720 --> 07:04.799
<font color="yellow">if you are not interested, why do</font>
<font color="yellow">you want me to be like anything?</font>

07:04.800 --> 07:06.999
<font color="#11FF11">I just think, when you know,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you know.</font>

07:07.000 --> 07:09.479
<font color="#11FF11">When you do know, you know.</font>

07:09.480 --> 07:11.759
<font color="#11FF11">I know what I have come</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in here wanting.</font>

07:11.760 --> 07:14.239
<font color="#11FF11">I know it is called Love Island,</font>

07:14.240 --> 07:18.159
<font color="#11FF11">so I am gonna wait until</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I get what I want from it.</font>

07:18.160 --> 07:20.039
<font color="#11FF11">No disrespect to you.</font>

07:20.040 --> 07:22.599
<font color="yellow">No disrespect taken.</font>
<font color="yellow">That is all I needed to hear.</font>

07:22.600 --> 07:25.679
<font color="yellow">Throughout this whole process.</font>
<font color="yellow">That is all you needed to say.</font>

07:25.680 --> 07:27.359
<font color="yellow">It has taken you this long</font>

07:27.360 --> 07:29.999
<font color="yellow">to actually pick up the</font>
<font color="yellow">courage and say something.</font>

07:30.000 --> 07:32.519
<font color="#11FF11">At least I have got the courage,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">at the end of the day.</font>

07:32.520 --> 07:35.919
<font color="yellow">What does that mean? I have had the</font>
<font color="yellow">courage to come and have</font>

07:35.920 --> 07:39.559
<font color="yellow">a chat with you four times a day</font>
<font color="yellow">and from the get go I have felt</font>

07:39.560 --> 07:42.479
<font color="yellow">that you haven't tried to get to</font>
<font color="yellow">know shit about me.</font>

07:42.480 --> 07:44.919
<font color="#11FF11">I have, I do know stuff about you.</font>

07:44.920 --> 07:47.719
<font color="#11FF11">I know you've got two brothers,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I know you've got a sister.</font>

07:47.720 --> 07:50.519
<font color="yellow">We've had this conversation.</font>
<font color="yellow">I asked you that the other day.</font>

07:50.520 --> 07:52.599
<font color="yellow">Is that all you can really</font>
<font color="yellow">list off to me?</font>

07:52.600 --> 07:55.479
<font color="yellow">Two brothers, a sister and a dog?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I know you like nature.</font>

07:55.480 --> 07:58.999
<font color="yellow">I think everyone in here can</font>
<font color="yellow">establish all those things.</font>

07:59.000 --> 08:03.439
<font color="yellow">You haven't shown any bit of you</font>
<font color="yellow">enjoy being a couple with me.</font>

08:03.440 --> 08:06.679
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like when I do speak to you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and try and make an effort</font>

08:06.680 --> 08:08.439
<font color="#11FF11">you're a bit like... hm...</font>

08:08.440 --> 08:10.319
<font color="yellow">That is after you...</font>

08:10.320 --> 08:13.239
<font color="#11FF11">Why am I gonna make the effort</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with someone who is like... hm?</font>

08:13.240 --> 08:16.079
<font color="#11FF11">Do you know what I mean? </font><font color="cyan"> I don't</font>
<font color="cyan">think you are compatible.</font>

08:16.080 --> 08:19.679
<font color="yellow">I really don't think we are. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I am</font>
<font color="#11FF11">done with Eyal, I can't be arsed.</font>

08:19.680 --> 08:22.159
<font color="#11FF11">What is the point putting</font>
<font color="#11FF11">your energy in someone</font>

08:22.160 --> 08:25.599
<font color="#11FF11">that you don't see going any</font>
<font color="#11FF11">further?</font>

08:25.600 --> 08:28.119
Well, that relationship has
definitely gone to

08:28.120 --> 08:29.799
H-Eyal in a handcart!

08:29.800 --> 08:31.559
And the girls aren't done yet.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.679
<font color="yellow">Did you all have to go around</font>
<font color="yellow">in a circle</font>

08:33.679 --> 08:35.919
<font color="yellow">and say who you were with</font>
<font color="yellow">and if you were happy?</font>

08:35.919 --> 08:38.159
<font color="yellow">Did you do say, I have had it hard?</font>

08:38.159 --> 08:41.599
<font color="yellow">Because I was a late arrival and</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm with Kendall and that was it?</font>

08:41.600 --> 08:43.839
<font color="#11FF11">No, I didn't say that at all.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What did I say?</font>

08:43.840 --> 08:45.959
<font color="cyan">No, you said "I was</font>
<font color="cyan">the sixth boy to come down.</font>

08:45.960 --> 08:47.599
<font color="cyan">I chose Kendall. And I am happy."</font>

08:47.600 --> 08:49.959
<font color="cyan">You said all that.</font>
<font color="yellow">Did you say you were happy?</font>

08:49.960 --> 08:52.399
He said he was good.
Yeah, he said he was happy. <font color="yellow">OK.</font>

08:52.400 --> 08:57.839
<font color="#11FF11">Kendall, I didn't realise how</font>
<font color="#11FF11">insecure she might have been.</font>

08:57.840 --> 08:59.759
<font color="#11FF11">Especially with me.</font>

08:59.760 --> 09:02.519
<font color="#11FF11">I thought she would have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a little bit more confidence in us.</font>

09:02.520 --> 09:05.519
<font color="#11FF11">To be honest, it might be</font>
<font color="#11FF11">grinding on us a little bit.</font>

09:05.520 --> 09:08.079
<font color="#11FF11">Are you going to keep</font>
<font color="#11FF11">knocking us back for kisses now?</font>

09:08.080 --> 09:11.319
She's gonna snog your face off
later, don't you worry. <font color="yellow">No, I'm not.</font>

09:11.320 --> 09:15.439
<font color="yellow">I'm not gonna put it on you just</font>
<font color="yellow">to try and, like, keep you with me.</font>

09:15.440 --> 09:18.079
<font color="yellow">I am going at my own pace</font>
<font color="yellow">and if it is too slow for you,</font>

09:18.080 --> 09:19.719
<font color="yellow">you can go with another girl.</font>

09:19.720 --> 09:21.919
<font color="yellow">I am not going to try and... </font><font color="cyan"> No!</font>

09:21.920 --> 09:27.840
<font color="cyan">He's not saying that. </font><font color="yellow"> OK.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm only winding you up.</font>

09:34.320 --> 09:37.359
<font color="yellow">I do dance, though.</font>
Are you a good dancer? <font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

09:37.360 --> 09:39.919
I feel like I've got
a bit of rhythm. <font color="yellow">Oh, have you?</font>

09:39.920 --> 09:41.759
<font color="yellow">What is your favourite</font>
<font color="yellow">type of music?</font>

09:41.760 --> 09:44.559
I like country.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.279
<font color="yellow">Country, babes?</font>
<font color="yellow">Like, with the cowboy hats?</font>

09:47.280 --> 09:49.319
No, just like 'Jolene' and that.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.959
<font color="yellow">Like... # Jolene... #</font>
<font color="yellow">That one?</font>

09:50.960 --> 09:53.199
# Jolene, Jolene, Jolene! #

09:53.200 --> 09:57.319
Do you not like that?
<font color="yellow">Erm...</font> Or nah? <font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

09:57.320 --> 10:00.959
It depends on your mood as well.
<font color="yellow">You make me giggle! (LAUGHS)</font>

10:00.960 --> 10:03.959
It depends on your mood and stuff,
doesn't it? <font color="yellow">Of course it does.</font>

10:03.960 --> 10:05.799
<font color="cyan">Someone really needs</font>
<font color="cyan">to make me laugh.</font>

10:05.800 --> 10:07.559
<font color="cyan">I love someone</font>
<font color="cyan">who can make me laugh.</font>

10:07.560 --> 10:12.199
<font color="cyan">I have got a lot of boyfriends -</font>
<font color="cyan">friends who are boys - back home,</font>

10:12.200 --> 10:14.719
<font color="cyan">and I see them after work</font>
<font color="cyan">and we will go and play golf,</font>

10:14.720 --> 10:16.839
<font color="cyan">or go and do this and that.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You play golf?</font>

10:16.840 --> 10:19.559
<font color="cyan">I started it because everybody else</font>
<font color="cyan">seemed to be doing it.</font>

10:19.560 --> 10:21.999
<font color="#11FF11">What is your distance,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">how many yards are you going?</font>

10:22.000 --> 10:25.079
<font color="cyan">My friend who was teaching me,</font>
<font color="cyan">he was quite impressed with me.</font>

10:25.080 --> 10:27.919
<font color="cyan">For a beginner,</font>
<font color="cyan">I am actually hitting the ball.</font>

10:27.920 --> 10:31.159
I will just be straightforward,
I think you're absolutely stunning.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.839
<font color="yellow">Aw, thank you.</font>

10:32.840 --> 10:34.679
I do, I think you are unreal.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.039
Do you feel like
we have a connection?

10:37.040 --> 10:40.999
<font color="yellow">Erm, I think there could be</font>
<font color="yellow">potential, maybe, yeah.</font>

10:41.000 --> 10:44.439
<font color="yellow">How about you?</font>
Yeah, 100%. <font color="yellow">(LAUGHTER)</font>

10:44.440 --> 10:47.559
<font color="yellow">OK, I will stop playing, too!</font>
<font color="yellow">I quite like you.</font>

10:47.560 --> 10:52.079
I have been absolutely waiting for
someone to come through the door.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.199
<font color="yellow">Aw, really?</font> Yeah, honestly.
<font color="yellow">That makes me feel really special.</font>

10:56.200 --> 10:58.159
<font color="cyan">There are some great people in the</font>
<font color="cyan">villa.</font>

10:58.160 --> 10:59.879
<font color="cyan">It's a challenging environment.</font>

10:59.880 --> 11:02.799
<font color="cyan">It tests you every day, and I feel</font>
<font color="cyan">like I have had that already.</font>

11:02.800 --> 11:04.759
<font color="cyan">There are ups and downs.</font>

11:04.760 --> 11:09.799
<font color="cyan">You've gotta enjoy the great</font>
<font color="cyan">moments, like being here with you.</font>

11:09.800 --> 11:14.119
<font color="cyan">A gorgeous girl. It's not bad, is</font>
<font color="cyan">it, really? It is a good evening.</font>

11:14.120 --> 11:17.959
<font color="#11FF11">You are a lovely guy</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I've got high hopes for you.</font>

11:17.960 --> 11:20.640
<font color="cyan">Thank you, I have high hopes</font>
<font color="cyan">for you as well.</font>

11:22.280 --> 11:24.639
<font color="cyan">Cheers to that again!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, cheers.</font>

11:24.640 --> 11:28.559
<font color="yellow">Thank you for a lovely time.</font>
Oh, shit...

11:28.560 --> 11:30.440
Sorry, yeah.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.079
<font color="yellow">Oh, God.</font>

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
Can I have a kiss? Just like...

11:54.440 --> 11:58.199
Still to come,
Wes spills the beans...

11:58.200 --> 12:01.999
<font color="yellow">They had a kiss on the date.</font>
<font color="cyan">Who?! </font><font color="yellow"> Niall and Georgia.</font>

12:02.000 --> 12:03.919
<font color="cyan">Shut the front door!</font>

12:03.920 --> 12:06.160
<font color="yellow">I feel like I've just done</font>
<font color="yellow">the dirty. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You have!</font>

12:13.880 --> 12:16.839
The dates are over,
because a lorry showed up

12:16.840 --> 12:18.879
and we had to shift
those trestle tables.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.599
So now it's time for the new girls
to meet the gang.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.639
<font color="yellow">You all right, everyone?</font>
<font color="yellow">This is Georgia.</font>

12:24.640 --> 12:26.679
<font color="yellow">She is a great girl,</font>
<font color="yellow">so be nice.</font>

12:26.680 --> 12:29.719
<font color="cyan">Girls, this is Rosie.</font>

12:29.720 --> 12:35.799
<font color="#11FF11">Nice to meet you.</font>
How are you? <font color="yellow">Lovely to meet you.</font>

12:35.800 --> 12:39.640
<font color="yellow">You smell lovely.</font>

12:41.360 --> 12:44.639
<font color="cyan">I think I found a rainbow fish,</font>
<font color="cyan">I shit you not.</font>

12:44.640 --> 12:48.759
<font color="cyan">I think I found one,</font>
<font color="cyan">I shit you not.</font>

12:48.760 --> 12:51.240
<font color="yellow">Is it in the bag? </font><font color="cyan"> I don't know.</font>

13:00.680 --> 13:04.760
<font color="#11FF11">What? </font><font color="yellow"> Get the fuck down here now!</font>
<font color="yellow">Get on my back now.</font>

13:06.920 --> 13:11.319
<font color="cyan">My date with Georgia, I will be</font>
<font color="cyan">honest - one word, it was magical.</font>

13:11.320 --> 13:15.320
<font color="#11FF11">It was a good first date.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">How did you find it?</font>

13:20.440 --> 13:24.359
<font color="cyan">She didn't care about anything,</font>
<font color="cyan">like... It was class.</font>

13:24.360 --> 13:26.239
<font color="yellow">The smooch,</font>
<font color="yellow">how did that come about?</font>

13:26.240 --> 13:28.759
<font color="cyan">I felt like we had such</font>
<font color="cyan">a good connection, like...</font>

13:28.760 --> 13:31.759
<font color="#11FF11">Lay it on thick again on her.</font>

13:31.760 --> 13:34.839
<font color="yellow">Did she lean over and you got it</font>
<font color="yellow">over and done with over the table?</font>

13:34.840 --> 13:36.559
<font color="cyan">Just go for it, yeah. </font><font color="yellow"> Bosh?</font>

13:36.560 --> 13:38.199
<font color="cyan">I have never had that thing where</font>

13:38.200 --> 13:40.799
<font color="cyan">I have just wanted to kiss someone,</font>
<font color="cyan">like...</font>

13:40.800 --> 13:43.159
<font color="#11FF11">Just go for it. </font><font color="cyan"> Yeah.</font>

13:43.160 --> 13:46.239
<font color="#11FF11">I am really pleased for you, man.</font>

13:46.240 --> 13:48.279
<font color="yellow">The thing is you have met her</font>
<font color="yellow">for one date.</font>

13:48.280 --> 13:49.839
<font color="cyan">Yeah, I have met her for one date,</font>

13:49.840 --> 13:52.039
<font color="cyan">but the one date I had with her was</font>
<font color="cyan">the best.</font>

13:52.040 --> 13:54.799
<font color="cyan">It is the best chat I have had with</font>
<font color="cyan">any of the girls in here.</font>

13:54.800 --> 13:57.719
<font color="cyan">I just felt it felt natural</font>
<font color="cyan">to go in with a kiss with her.</font>

13:57.720 --> 14:02.119
<font color="cyan">I went in for it and it was good.</font>
<font color="cyan">It wasn't full giraffe.</font>

14:02.120 --> 14:05.239
<font color="cyan">Let her know I was there a bit,</font>
<font color="cyan">but not go all weird on her.</font>

14:05.240 --> 14:07.399
<font color="cyan">Do you know what I mean?</font>
<font color="cyan">It was decent.</font>

14:07.400 --> 14:10.719
<font color="yellow">You went on a date with...?</font>
<font color="cyan">Neil. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Niall?</font>

14:10.720 --> 14:12.759
(LAUGHTER)

14:12.760 --> 14:15.479
<font color="cyan">Whoops! Er, yes.</font>
<font color="cyan">And it was really lovely.</font>

14:15.480 --> 14:20.719
<font color="cyan">We got on really well, it was very</font>
<font color="cyan">real. The chat just flowed. Yeah.</font>

14:20.720 --> 14:25.319
You see, if you really want to get
the flames of passion burning,

14:25.320 --> 14:28.759
stick 'em in a car park
with a bowl of patatas bravas.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.959
But did Cupid work
his magic on Alex?

14:31.960 --> 14:33.599
<font color="yellow">She's a nice girl.</font>

14:33.600 --> 14:36.799
<font color="yellow">It was a really good date,</font>
<font color="yellow">we had a really nice setting,</font>

14:36.800 --> 14:39.759
<font color="yellow">she is Welsh, she is a clever girl.</font>

14:39.760 --> 14:41.799
<font color="yellow">We have a lot in common.</font>

14:41.800 --> 14:46.759
<font color="yellow">I think probably, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">I am not her normal type.</font>

14:46.760 --> 14:51.919
<font color="yellow">But from chatting to her,</font>
<font color="yellow">I think she has realised her type</font>

14:51.920 --> 14:53.639
<font color="yellow">isn't always the right decision.</font>

14:53.640 --> 14:55.839
<font color="yellow">It was definitely</font>
<font color="yellow">much more positive,</font>

14:55.840 --> 14:59.199
<font color="yellow">it was great to just go on a date</font>
<font color="yellow">and have a nice time with someone</font>

14:59.200 --> 15:01.159
<font color="yellow">and just have a chat, really.</font>

15:01.160 --> 15:03.679
<font color="yellow">It was cool to have</font>
<font color="yellow">a bit of a connection.</font>

15:03.680 --> 15:05.479
<font color="cyan">How was your date with Alex?</font>

15:05.480 --> 15:07.519
<font color="#11FF11">It was lovely, he is a lovely boy.</font>

15:07.520 --> 15:09.839
<font color="#11FF11">I don't see it being</font>
<font color="#11FF11">any more than friendship.</font>

15:09.840 --> 15:13.999
<font color="#11FF11">No, he is lovely to talk to.</font>
<font color="cyan">How nice is he? </font><font color="#11FF11"> So nice.</font>

15:14.000 --> 15:15.959
We were just all rooting for him.

15:15.960 --> 15:22.399
<font color="cyan">He's literally the nicest guy</font>
<font color="cyan">in the whole wide world. It's mad.</font>

15:22.400 --> 15:24.279
<font color="cyan">Who are you attracted to?</font>

15:24.280 --> 15:29.399
<font color="#11FF11">Initial types I am attracted</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to are Niall and Adam.</font>

15:29.400 --> 15:31.359
<font color="#11FF11">I'm more of a personality person</font>

15:31.360 --> 15:33.999
<font color="#11FF11">so whoever I am initially attracted</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to in life,</font>

15:34.000 --> 15:36.639
<font color="#11FF11">I know I've always had feelings for</font>
<font color="#11FF11">someone</font>

15:36.640 --> 15:39.119
<font color="#11FF11">that I've met and gone</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he's not my type.</font>

15:39.120 --> 15:43.919
<font color="#11FF11">It's a bit hard to say I am</font>
<font color="#11FF11">initially attracted to him,</font>

15:43.920 --> 15:47.679
<font color="#11FF11">and then the girl he has coupled up</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with is sat next to you.</font>

15:47.680 --> 15:50.799
<font color="#11FF11">You have to be honest</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and say who you are attracted to.</font>

15:50.800 --> 15:54.079
<font color="#11FF11">Adam is definitely more</font>
<font color="#11FF11">me than anyone.</font>

15:54.080 --> 15:56.119
<font color="yellow">He's only 22.</font>

15:56.120 --> 15:59.239
<font color="#11FF11">I know, he seems much more mature.</font>
<font color="yellow">He seems like 26.</font>

15:59.240 --> 16:03.639
<font color="#11FF11">I think he's well into Kendall,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">though. And she's so lovely.</font>

16:03.640 --> 16:07.079
<font color="yellow">She's lovely, but you have got to</font>
<font color="yellow">do what you want to do, babe.</font>

16:07.080 --> 16:09.159
Quite right, Georgia.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.679
And what Wes wants to do is have a
good old gossip

16:11.680 --> 16:13.599
in an overpopulated air bed.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.239
<font color="yellow">They had a kiss on the date.</font>
<font color="cyan">Who? </font><font color="yellow"> Niall and Georgia.</font>

16:17.240 --> 16:19.719
<font color="cyan">Shut the fucking front door!</font>
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

16:19.720 --> 16:23.639
<font color="#11FF11">He got off with her?</font>
<font color="cyan">She hasn't mentioned that.</font>

16:23.640 --> 16:27.279
<font color="cyan">See, you can't trust</font>
<font color="cyan">anyone in this game!</font>

16:27.280 --> 16:29.439
<font color="cyan">Seriously, you can't trust anyone.</font>

16:29.440 --> 16:31.279
<font color="yellow">I feel like I have just</font>
<font color="yellow">done the dirty.</font>

16:31.280 --> 16:34.119
<font color="cyan">I just don't know why</font>
<font color="cyan">she wasn't honest</font>

16:34.120 --> 16:37.359
<font color="cyan">and said why she had</font>
<font color="cyan">a kiss with him.</font>

16:37.360 --> 16:40.639
<font color="cyan">Obviously, it is a bit weird...</font>

16:40.640 --> 16:44.039
<font color="#11FF11">Tell me about yours,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm so excited. </font><font color="yellow"> Oh, don't.</font>

16:44.040 --> 16:48.119
<font color="#11FF11">We maybe had a little kiss</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that I haven't told anyone.</font>

16:48.120 --> 16:51.999
<font color="#11FF11">We had proper banter.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We were laughing, having a joke.</font>

16:52.000 --> 16:55.519
<font color="#11FF11">I felt really at ease. At the end</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of the day, it's still early days.</font>

16:55.520 --> 16:58.039
<font color="#11FF11">I will just go with the flow.</font>
<font color="cyan">Is he a good kisser?</font>

16:58.040 --> 17:01.319
<font color="#11FF11">Mm, yeah. (GIGGLES)</font>

17:01.320 --> 17:03.559
<font color="#11FF11">You are making me giggly.</font>

17:03.560 --> 17:06.358
<font color="#11FF11">No, I like him a bit.</font>

17:06.359 --> 17:10.199
<font color="yellow">So, tell us everything.</font>
<font color="cyan">How was your date?</font>

17:10.200 --> 17:16.159
<font color="#11FF11">She is a beautiful girl,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I think we connected</font>

17:16.160 --> 17:18.799
<font color="#11FF11">on a lot of levels and had a joke</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and a laugh.</font>

17:18.800 --> 17:20.839
<font color="#11FF11">It was easy chat.</font>

17:20.839 --> 17:23.239
<font color="#11FF11">We didn't have a kiss at the end.</font>

17:23.240 --> 17:26.759
<font color="#11FF11">I know Niall and Georgia</font>
<font color="#11FF11">had a smooch.</font>

17:26.760 --> 17:28.679
<font color="#11FF11">I didn't go for that, I think.</font>

17:28.680 --> 17:30.880
<font color="cyan">What? </font><font color="#11FF11"> You didn't know?</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh, you didn't know?</font>

17:33.760 --> 17:36.239
So, the end of an emotional night,

17:36.240 --> 17:38.399
I think we have learned one thing
for sure -

17:38.400 --> 17:41.319
these giant orange blankets
are a big hit.

17:41.320 --> 17:45.039
Anyway, time for bed
and a little bit of Jack and Dani.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.679
Not that! Get your minds
out of the gutter!

17:47.680 --> 17:51.359
<font color="yellow">Can we have a cuddle now</font>
<font color="yellow">we're mates again? </font><font color="cyan"> No.</font>

17:51.360 --> 17:56.039
<font color="yellow">I don't fancy one of them, though.</font>
<font color="cyan">If you did, that is fine.</font>

17:56.040 --> 17:57.679
<font color="yellow">I fancy you, though.</font>

17:57.680 --> 17:59.919
<font color="cyan">I don't know why</font>
<font color="cyan">when I look like this right now.</font>

17:59.920 --> 18:01.559
<font color="yellow">I think you are a sort.</font>

18:01.560 --> 18:03.599
<font color="yellow">You are.</font>

18:03.600 --> 18:05.880
<font color="yellow">Top-shelf stuff.</font>

18:07.880 --> 18:10.759
<font color="yellow">We're mates again now?</font>

18:10.760 --> 18:12.760
(DANCE MUSIC)

19:06.400 --> 19:09.400
Still to come, a super challenge...

19:11.960 --> 19:13.560
<font color="yellow">I have been in worse positions.</font>

19:21.760 --> 19:25.879
Last night, two leggy birds arrived
at the villa. There they are.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.679
Right, I've got my hands on the
remote-control curtains.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.680
Let's wake this lot up.

19:39.120 --> 19:46.279
<font color="cyan">Hey.</font>

19:46.280 --> 19:51.039
In the gym, Adam's putting Alex
through the workout all men dread.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.159
And three, two, one,
and talk about your feelings.

19:54.160 --> 19:58.279
<font color="yellow">Rosie is a lovely girl. She is</font>
<font color="yellow">intuitive.</font>

19:58.280 --> 20:04.799
<font color="cyan">If you had a choice,</font>
<font color="cyan">would you stick with Samira?</font>

20:04.800 --> 20:10.119
<font color="yellow">I feel that she has not had her</font>
<font color="yellow">chance yet.</font>

20:10.120 --> 20:16.279
<font color="yellow">It seems a shame for her to go.</font>

20:16.280 --> 20:18.999
<font color="cyan">You think about number one though.</font>

20:19.000 --> 20:23.759
<font color="yellow">We'll see what happens with Rose in</font>
<font color="yellow">the next few days.</font>

20:23.760 --> 20:28.479
<font color="yellow">I would not rule out things</font>
<font color="yellow">progressing.</font>

20:28.480 --> 20:31.759
<font color="cyan">Romantically, you need to give a</font>
<font color="cyan">chance.</font>

20:31.760 --> 20:39.239
<font color="cyan">With Rosie,</font>
<font color="cyan">it'll be more of a shot.</font>

20:39.240 --> 20:45.719
<font color="cyan">If the Samira thing's been shut</font>
<font color="cyan">down...</font>

20:45.720 --> 20:49.319
If that's all people do in the gym,
I might give it a go.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.199
But maybe Adam should be spending
a bit more time

20:52.200 --> 20:54.039
worrying about Kendall.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.519
<font color="yellow">When the girls came in, everybody</font>
<font color="yellow">said nice things about the girls.</font>

20:57.520 --> 21:03.599
<font color="yellow">Adam stated he was with Kendall.</font>

21:03.600 --> 21:10.839
<font color="yellow">Shit, maybe I'm into him</font>
<font color="yellow">more than I thought.</font>

21:10.840 --> 21:18.439
<font color="cyan">She fancies him, doesn't she?</font>
<font color="yellow">Rosie likes him.</font>

21:18.440 --> 21:21.479
<font color="yellow">I do feel like, because I want to</font>
<font color="yellow">take it slow,</font>

21:21.480 --> 21:26.159
<font color="yellow">he does not want to wait around for.</font>

21:26.160 --> 21:32.159
<font color="cyan">My last two girlfriends,</font>
<font color="cyan">exactly the same insecurities.</font>

21:32.160 --> 21:36.159
<font color="cyan">If that went all the way to the</font>
<font color="cyan">outside, would she do the same?</font>

21:36.160 --> 21:43.119
<font color="cyan">Even here,</font>
<font color="cyan">it is the same situation.</font>

21:43.120 --> 21:47.439
<font color="cyan">If I talk to any girl, it is always</font>
<font color="cyan">like, 'What are you doing?'</font>

21:47.440 --> 21:55.839
<font color="cyan">Insecurity is the one thing</font>

21:55.840 --> 22:00.319
<font color="cyan">where I am thinking</font>
<font color="cyan">I do not want that any more.</font>

22:00.320 --> 22:04.759
<font color="cyan">Since everything has changed in the</font>
<font color="cyan">villa,</font>

22:04.760 --> 22:07.279
<font color="cyan">I want to flip the situation on its</font>
<font color="cyan">head</font>

22:07.280 --> 22:13.199
<font color="cyan">and go for somebody</font>
<font color="cyan">completely different.</font>

22:13.200 --> 22:16.239
Kendall, bit of advice,
stop feeling insecure

22:16.240 --> 22:18.799
or Adam will definitely
ditch you for someone else.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.679
I'm not helping, am I? At least
Georgia and Niall are getting on.

22:22.680 --> 22:31.039
<font color="cyan">Everyone is asking what's going on.</font>
<font color="cyan">'How was your day?'</font>

22:31.040 --> 22:40.759
<font color="cyan">It was really good. You make me</font>
<font color="cyan">laugh, constantly.</font>

22:40.760 --> 22:48.439
<font color="cyan">I need to catch some sun rays. You</font>
<font color="cyan">make me laugh.</font>

22:48.440 --> 22:52.319
<font color="cyan">I never thought that coming in, I'd</font>
<font color="cyan">fancy someone straightaway.</font>

22:52.320 --> 22:57.599
<font color="cyan">Niall instantly captured my</font>
<font color="cyan">attention.</font>

22:57.600 --> 23:00.879
<font color="cyan">I was always the girl that fancied</font>
<font color="cyan">the naughty boy at school.</font>

23:00.880 --> 23:06.079
<font color="cyan">It is that cheeky type.</font>

23:06.080 --> 23:10.560
<font color="cyan">Rosie.</font>

23:22.200 --> 23:24.439
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

23:24.440 --> 23:29.119
<font color="yellow">What would I like to look like?</font>

23:29.120 --> 23:32.639
<font color="cyan">You look like yourself, look</font>
<font color="cyan">confident.</font>

23:32.640 --> 23:39.559
<font color="yellow">He would be the sort of person I'd</font>
<font color="yellow">follow on Instagram for gym tips.</font>

23:39.560 --> 23:46.359
<font color="yellow">I want to go at a normal pace with</font>
<font color="yellow">Georgia.</font>

23:46.360 --> 23:56.319
<font color="yellow">I am forgetting the whole</font>
<font color="yellow">'Lay it on thick' thing.</font>

23:56.320 --> 24:01.879
<font color="yellow">I usually just tell the girl what</font>
<font color="yellow">she wants to hear. This is genuine.</font>

24:01.880 --> 24:05.559
Yes, Niall, be genuine,
tell her you think she's a fish.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.839
Now, in any relationship,
it's important to make plans.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.599
And Hayley's got some for Eyal.

24:11.600 --> 24:17.159
<font color="yellow">We are very vulnerable at the</font>
<font color="yellow">moment.</font>

24:17.160 --> 24:22.119
<font color="cyan">I do not feel I have anything.</font>

24:22.120 --> 24:27.479
<font color="cyan">I just want to know where your head</font>
<font color="cyan">is at.</font>

24:27.480 --> 24:31.399
<font color="cyan">I just don't think he picks out my</font>
<font color="cyan">personality.</font>

24:31.400 --> 24:38.319
<font color="yellow">You and Jack, you are bubbly</font>
<font color="yellow">together.</font>

24:38.320 --> 24:44.759
<font color="yellow">I get on with him, if you want to</font>
<font color="yellow">get to know Jack,</font>

24:44.760 --> 24:49.760
<font color="yellow">I am totally A-OK with that. </font><font color="cyan"> Maybe,</font>
<font color="cyan">we just swap?</font>

24:52.520 --> 24:57.279
<font color="cyan">For one, it might take the pressure</font>
<font color="cyan">off.</font>

24:57.280 --> 25:01.119
<font color="cyan">Dani is stating that her and Jack</font>
<font color="cyan">want to be friends only.</font>

25:01.120 --> 25:08.559
<font color="cyan">Jack is the safer option.</font>

25:08.560 --> 25:14.760
<font color="cyan">If you wanted to swap with...</font>

25:16.360 --> 25:18.600
<font color="cyan">What's his name?</font>

25:20.560 --> 25:22.199
<font color="cyan">Eyal.</font>

25:22.200 --> 25:27.119
<font color="cyan">I told her if she wants to swap</font>
<font color="cyan">with him, we can do it.</font>

25:27.120 --> 25:32.119
<font color="yellow">We can see what happens. We have</font>
<font color="yellow">nothing to lose.</font>

25:32.120 --> 25:35.959
<font color="yellow">I do not want us two to go.</font>

25:35.960 --> 25:43.519
<font color="yellow">I am a bit of a fronter.</font>

25:43.520 --> 25:49.199
<font color="yellow">It would upset me if that happened.</font>

25:49.200 --> 25:52.319
<font color="yellow">It feels I did not give it a go</font>
<font color="yellow">with Jack,</font>

25:52.320 --> 25:56.359
<font color="yellow">but if Hayley wanted to crack</font>
<font color="yellow">on with him,</font>

25:56.360 --> 25:59.239
<font color="yellow">it is something I'll have to deal</font>
<font color="yellow">with.</font>

25:59.240 --> 26:01.680
<font color="yellow">I will not cry over that.</font>

26:03.400 --> 26:06.039
It's challenge time,

26:06.040 --> 26:08.879
so Hayley's going to have to wait to
deal with erm,

26:08.880 --> 26:11.959
you know that guy... No, it's gone.

26:11.960 --> 26:18.600
<font color="yellow">I have a text. </font><font color="cyan"> Come on.</font>

26:36.160 --> 26:44.199
<font color="yellow">Do we get costumes? </font><font color="cyan"> The boys are</font>
<font color="cyan">going down.</font>

26:44.200 --> 26:49.839
Our lawyers have told us we're
legally forbidden

26:49.840 --> 26:52.679
from using any actual superhero
names.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.159
So today's big challenge is to get
through this game

26:55.160 --> 26:58.679
without being sued, which would
be marvel... lous.

26:58.680 --> 27:04.240
OK, bring in the generic super
females.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.360
The challenge is called Girl Power.

27:11.280 --> 27:14.639
The ladies will go head-to-head in a
series of contests

27:14.640 --> 27:19.840
to prove which of them
really has the super power.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.799
Round One: super strength,

27:23.800 --> 27:26.919
where we discover which girl
has buns of steel.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.279
Not to be confused with the film Man
Of Steel

27:29.280 --> 27:31.639
which that was not a reference to.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.479
<font color="yellow">Three, two, one.</font>

27:35.480 --> 27:40.279
The girls will squash watermelons
with their bums.

27:40.280 --> 27:43.799
The slowest girl to crush her
melon is out of the contest.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.879
First up: Samira and Dani.

27:45.880 --> 27:53.279
<font color="yellow">I smashed it. I was shook. I was</font>
<font color="yellow">bouncing away.</font>

27:53.280 --> 27:57.319
<font color="cyan">I could not crack the watermelon.</font>

27:57.320 --> 28:01.759
<font color="cyan">I thought I had the power but wrong</font>
<font color="cyan">position.</font>

28:01.760 --> 28:05.239
<font color="cyan">That is literally</font>
<font color="cyan">the hardest thing I have ever done.</font>

28:05.240 --> 28:08.559
Samira's quickest and makes it
through to Round Two.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.599
Next up, new girl Georgia is taking
on Kendall.

28:11.600 --> 28:17.839
<font color="yellow">I did not do very well</font>
<font color="yellow">at mashing my melon.</font>

28:17.840 --> 28:24.559
<font color="cyan">It usually helps me, my bum.</font>

28:24.560 --> 28:28.480
<font color="cyan">After you see my face, spin around.</font>

28:32.160 --> 28:35.159
<font color="yellow">I could not care less about who</font>
<font color="yellow">mashed their melons.</font>

28:35.160 --> 28:40.200
<font color="yellow">I know for a fact that Georgia</font>
<font color="yellow">squats a lot and I am into it.</font>

28:43.000 --> 28:46.200
Georgia came bottom meaning
Kendall goes through.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.119
Next to come is a three-way between
Laura, Rosie and Hayley.

28:52.120 --> 28:56.159
<font color="yellow">I absolutely loved today's</font>
<font color="yellow">challenge.</font>

28:56.160 --> 29:01.919
<font color="yellow">If you had the angle that we had,</font>
<font color="yellow">everybody would have enjoyed it.</font>

29:01.920 --> 29:05.519
<font color="cyan">You have to go higher.</font>

29:05.520 --> 29:09.319
<font color="yellow">Impressive stuff from Laura.</font>

29:09.320 --> 29:13.759
<font color="yellow">I was a little bit scared at the</font>
<font color="yellow">time though.</font>

29:13.760 --> 29:18.199
<font color="cyan">I have never squashed melons with</font>
<font color="cyan">my arse before.</font>

29:18.200 --> 29:20.800
<font color="cyan">First time for everything.</font>

29:25.000 --> 29:27.879
So, Hayley was the last
to squash her melon,

29:27.880 --> 29:30.719
meaning Rosie and Laura
are also through.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.999
<font color="yellow">Three, two, one.</font>

29:34.000 --> 29:37.119
In Round Two, the girls will be
tested on their super speed.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.679
Each remaining girl will take turns
defending one of the boys

29:40.680 --> 29:42.639
from a barrage
of slimeballs.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.719
First up, Samira is defending Jack.

29:45.720 --> 29:51.279
<font color="yellow">Adam literally, I have never seen</font>
<font color="yellow">so much determination.</font>

29:51.280 --> 29:56.599
<font color="yellow">He got me straight in the gut.</font>
<font color="yellow">I cannot be bothered after that.</font>

29:56.600 --> 30:00.399
Next up, Kendall is defending Alex.

30:00.400 --> 30:07.799
<font color="yellow">My goal defence tactics from</font>
<font color="yellow">netball from high school came in.</font>

30:07.800 --> 30:10.200
<font color="yellow">I did quite well on this one.</font>

30:12.400 --> 30:14.439
<font color="cyan">That was pony, mate!</font>

30:14.440 --> 30:19.560
<font color="yellow">Considering I am only 5'4".</font>

30:23.560 --> 30:29.159
<font color="yellow">I have to defend him.</font>
<font color="yellow">He is too pretty to be hit.</font>

30:29.160 --> 30:32.440
Last up, Laura is defending Niall.

30:40.280 --> 30:43.680
<font color="yellow">Floyd Mayweather in his prime.</font>

30:50.280 --> 30:54.319
After making a mess
of defending Niall, Laura is out.

30:54.320 --> 31:01.919
<font color="yellow">When I defended Niall, that was</font>
<font color="yellow">cheating.</font>

31:01.920 --> 31:04.359
<font color="cyan">Let us start the final round.</font>

31:04.360 --> 31:08.799
So, through to the final round are
Kendall, Samira and Rosie.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.839
The final round is called Tied Up.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.319
Each girl has been tied
to a random boy.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.239
They have to untie themselves

31:15.240 --> 31:18.399
and their boy, then kiss him
to end the game.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.519
<font color="yellow">Come on, Kendall. I was tied with</font>
<font color="yellow">Rosie, I cannot complain.</font>

31:22.520 --> 31:24.959
<font color="yellow">I have been in worse positions.</font>

31:24.960 --> 31:31.119
<font color="cyan">It was not the best view.</font>

31:31.120 --> 31:36.039
<font color="yellow">Go on, Rosie.</font>

31:36.040 --> 31:40.359
<font color="cyan">Come on, Kendall!</font>

31:40.360 --> 31:47.959
<font color="yellow">It was the first time I have been</font>
<font color="yellow">strapped beneath a woman.</font>

31:47.960 --> 31:55.279
<font color="cyan">I am quite competitive in these</font>
<font color="cyan">little games.</font>

31:55.280 --> 32:02.839
<font color="yellow">Get it, get it.</font>

32:02.840 --> 32:11.279
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

32:11.280 --> 32:19.879
<font color="cyan">It was a win-win. It was a win-win</font>
<font color="cyan">for everyone.</font>

32:19.880 --> 32:23.920
<font color="yellow">The girl with the most power is</font>
<font color="yellow">Kendall.</font>

32:27.240 --> 32:29.879
I think I managed to get
through that whole game

32:29.880 --> 32:32.919
without saying any actual names.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.759
That's super, man!

32:34.760 --> 32:37.559
Damn it!

32:37.560 --> 32:40.839
Still to come
It's time for some truth or dare.

32:40.840 --> 32:44.440
<font color="yellow">It will all end in tears. </font><font color="cyan"> Kiss</font>
<font color="cyan">somebody you fancy.</font>

32:47.840 --> 32:57.719
You have a chance to win £20,000 in
cash and a holiday in Majorca.

32:57.720 --> 33:05.599
You and five mates will stay at this
stunning five-star hotel.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.639
You will not even have to touch the
£20,000 prize money.

33:08.640 --> 33:14.960
Breakfast and dinner are included.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.239
I've been told the Islanders

33:54.240 --> 33:56.879
are going
to play a classic party game.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.199
Brilliant. I love pass the parcel.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.919
<font color="yellow">Let's play truth or dare.</font>
No. Pass the parcel!

34:02.920 --> 34:09.799
Niall? <font color="cyan">True. </font><font color="yellow"> Make it juicy. </font><font color="cyan"> Where</font>
<font color="cyan">have you done it in a public place?</font>

34:09.800 --> 34:19.679
<font color="yellow">I like a cup of tea after sex.</font>

34:19.679 --> 34:25.839
<font color="cyan">A normal game of trees all day is</font>
<font color="cyan">fine,</font>

34:25.840 --> 34:32.559
<font color="cyan">but when you are in a villa,</font>
<font color="cyan">it's all gonna end in tears.</font>

34:32.560 --> 34:37.280
<font color="yellow">Kiss someone that you would want to</font>
<font color="yellow">couple up with.</font>

34:41.000 --> 34:44.359
<font color="cyan">I honestly do not know who I want</font>
<font color="cyan">to couple up with</font>

34:44.360 --> 34:47.480
<font color="cyan">but I will go for a kiss anyway.</font>

34:49.080 --> 34:51.800
<font color="yellow">Oh, my days, rude boy.</font>

34:54.440 --> 34:59.279
<font color="cyan">I was really shocked.</font>

34:59.280 --> 35:06.679
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I kissed Kendall.</font>

35:06.680 --> 35:11.319
<font color="yellow">We were on the same wavelength at</font>
<font color="yellow">certain times.</font>

35:11.320 --> 35:14.879
<font color="yellow">I wanted to explore it more.</font>

35:14.880 --> 35:24.039
<font color="cyan">Rosie. Truth or dare? Kiss somebody</font>
<font color="cyan">you fancy.</font>

35:24.040 --> 35:32.440
<font color="yellow">I am not the kind of girl to sit</font>
<font color="yellow">there and not participate.</font>

35:41.400 --> 35:46.639
<font color="cyan">A decent kiss. Not going to lie.</font>

35:46.640 --> 35:55.319
<font color="yellow">That really surprised me. I was</font>
<font color="yellow">really shocked at that.</font>

35:55.320 --> 35:58.519
<font color="cyan">Truth or dare?</font>

35:58.520 --> 36:07.800
<font color="yellow">Other than Kendall, who do you</font>
<font color="yellow">fancy? </font><font color="cyan"> Rosie.</font>

36:13.400 --> 36:20.240
<font color="yellow">Kendall, truth or dare?</font>

36:22.480 --> 36:29.879
<font color="yellow">Who do you think I'll couple up</font>
<font color="yellow">with?</font>

36:29.880 --> 36:37.639
<font color="cyan">Rosie. </font><font color="yellow"> Rosie?</font>

36:37.640 --> 36:41.999
<font color="cyan">I think he will couple up with</font>
<font color="cyan">Rosie.</font>

36:42.000 --> 36:48.079
<font color="cyan">I was answering honestly.</font>

36:48.080 --> 36:53.679
<font color="cyan">I hope it is not the case but, hmm.</font>

36:53.680 --> 36:58.759
<font color="yellow">Dani. Truth.</font>

36:58.760 --> 37:04.159
<font color="yellow">If we had to start again, is there</font>
<font color="yellow">anyone you'd step forward for?</font>

37:04.160 --> 37:08.719
<font color="cyan">Jack.</font>

37:08.720 --> 37:18.320
<font color="#11FF11">Truth. </font><font color="cyan"> Who would you recouple with</font>
<font color="cyan">today?</font>

37:23.440 --> 37:28.040
<font color="yellow">Probably Hayley.</font>

37:32.520 --> 37:35.359
<font color="yellow">In that moment in time,</font>

37:35.360 --> 37:38.039
<font color="yellow">I chose her because I wanted to see</font>
<font color="yellow">Dani's reaction.</font>

37:38.040 --> 37:44.079
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see if her guard was</font>
<font color="yellow">down.</font>

37:44.080 --> 37:50.239
<font color="cyan">This is savage. </font><font color="yellow"> I love it, this is</font>
<font color="yellow">what I am here.</font>

37:50.240 --> 37:52.279
<font color="yellow">This is what I signed up for.</font>

37:52.280 --> 37:59.920
<font color="yellow">We're on fucking Love Island,</font>
<font color="yellow">of course it's savage.</font>

38:02.560 --> 38:05.879
I told you. You should've played
pass the parcel.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.479
Now, Adam's got some
explaining to do.

38:08.480 --> 38:15.479
<font color="yellow">Are you OK? </font><font color="cyan"> If I'm honest, alarm</font>
<font color="cyan">bells are ringing in my head.</font>

38:15.480 --> 38:21.759
<font color="cyan">I never normally would push this</font>
<font color="cyan">hard.</font>

38:21.760 --> 38:25.239
<font color="cyan">I don't think I ever have, apart</font>
<font color="cyan">from my ex-girlfriend.</font>

38:25.240 --> 38:28.879
<font color="cyan">I had nothing to make you think</font>
<font color="cyan">that I would pick somebody else.</font>

38:28.880 --> 38:32.679
<font color="yellow">It is just that I am insecure.</font>

38:32.680 --> 38:37.519
<font color="yellow">Rosie has come in, she is really</font>
<font color="yellow">attractive.</font>

38:37.520 --> 38:43.919
<font color="yellow">I know you two will get on. </font><font color="cyan"> What do</font>
<font color="cyan">you think that?</font>

38:43.920 --> 38:53.879
<font color="yellow">When I said you'd couple up with</font>
<font color="yellow">Rosie, you found her attractive.</font>

38:53.880 --> 39:01.159
<font color="cyan">I do. I chose you anyway.</font>

39:01.160 --> 39:07.479
<font color="cyan">I feel like I am already in a</font>
<font color="cyan">relationship with you,</font>

39:07.480 --> 39:13.439
<font color="cyan">in terms of the chat but not</font>
<font color="cyan">getting the benefits and affection.</font>

39:13.440 --> 39:15.559
<font color="yellow">I just told you, I am taking it</font>
<font color="yellow">slow.</font>

39:15.560 --> 39:24.399
<font color="cyan">I know but you cuddle me and hug in</font>
<font color="cyan">bed,</font>

39:24.400 --> 39:30.479
<font color="cyan">but when I come and chat to you,</font>
<font color="cyan">you pull away or you push me away.</font>

39:30.480 --> 39:36.239
<font color="cyan">You are scared to let me in.</font>

39:36.240 --> 39:39.439
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

39:39.440 --> 39:45.560
<font color="yellow">I am sorry if I made you feel like</font>
<font color="yellow">that. I did not mean to.</font>

39:52.400 --> 39:57.239
<font color="cyan">I think we should just take it easy</font>
<font color="cyan">and see what happens.</font>

39:57.240 --> 40:01.559
<font color="yellow">I have not got a clue where all of</font>
<font color="yellow">that came from.</font>

40:01.560 --> 40:05.479
<font color="yellow">I am obviously a bit insecure,</font>

40:05.480 --> 40:07.639
<font color="yellow">I had only known you for a couple</font>
<font color="yellow">of days.</font>

40:07.640 --> 40:12.839
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be to jump on you</font>
<font color="yellow">and wrap my legs around you?</font>

40:12.840 --> 40:19.359
<font color="cyan">Are you OK?</font>

40:19.360 --> 40:24.519
<font color="yellow">I know how this game is played.</font>

40:24.520 --> 40:32.559
<font color="yellow">I've come in here to try and find</font>
<font color="yellow">someone and move on.</font>

40:32.560 --> 40:38.119
<font color="yellow">Because it's gonna take me longer</font>
<font color="yellow">than most,</font>

40:38.120 --> 40:45.880
<font color="yellow">I'm being punished for that.</font>

40:54.240 --> 41:00.760
<font color="cyan">My chat with Kendall was awkward.</font>
<font color="yellow">It is a lot.</font>

41:03.680 --> 41:08.280
<font color="cyan">You have done so well. You have</font>
<font color="cyan">coped well.</font>

41:13.800 --> 41:16.719
After Jack said he'd couple up with
Hayley

41:16.720 --> 41:20.199
in that game of Truth or Dare, he's
also got some explaining to do.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.559
<font color="yellow">I did not mean anything by it.</font>

41:22.560 --> 41:28.199
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make it interesting at</font>
<font color="yellow">the time.</font>

41:28.200 --> 41:35.239
<font color="yellow">From our last conversation, we did</font>
<font color="yellow">not know.</font>

41:35.240 --> 41:38.199
<font color="cyan">I do not know, it is difficult.</font>

41:38.200 --> 41:44.279
<font color="yellow">I would happily wait around, but</font>
<font color="yellow">I've come to find somebody.</font>

41:44.280 --> 41:47.839
<font color="yellow">Nothing is coming back my way.</font>

41:47.840 --> 41:50.959
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I am saying?</font>

41:50.960 --> 41:56.439
<font color="cyan">When I first came in here, Jack and</font>
<font color="cyan">I got on.</font>

41:56.440 --> 41:58.519
<font color="cyan">We were coupled up.</font>

41:58.520 --> 42:03.999
<font color="cyan">You feel like a couple</font>

42:04.000 --> 42:08.959
<font color="cyan">but I am not usually that forward</font>
<font color="cyan">with a boy straightaway.</font>

42:08.960 --> 42:16.799
<font color="yellow">It is up to me, that is what I am</font>
<font color="yellow">saying. </font><font color="cyan"> I cannot help the way I am.</font>

42:16.800 --> 42:20.839
<font color="yellow">Please, stop crying.</font>

42:20.840 --> 42:24.919
<font color="cyan">I always have my guard up with a</font>
<font color="cyan">boy.</font>

42:24.920 --> 42:32.359
<font color="cyan">I break it down but with Jack.</font>

42:32.360 --> 42:36.239
<font color="cyan">He wants it all now.</font>

42:36.240 --> 42:39.399
<font color="yellow">It is hard work. </font><font color="cyan"> It is not easy.</font>

42:39.400 --> 42:43.439
<font color="yellow">Do you think I want to do that?</font>

42:43.440 --> 42:50.479
<font color="yellow">In a way, I was trying to make it</font>
<font color="yellow">more fun.</font>

42:50.480 --> 42:55.079
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make you see if you</font>
<font color="yellow">cared.</font>

42:55.080 --> 42:59.319
<font color="yellow">I told you how much I fancied you.</font>

42:59.320 --> 43:03.279
<font color="cyan">I said that to you. </font><font color="yellow"> Liar. You have</font>
<font color="yellow">not.</font>

43:03.280 --> 43:10.519
<font color="cyan">It is not that I do not like you</font>
<font color="cyan">but...</font>

43:10.520 --> 43:19.119
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, stick to what you know.</font>

43:19.120 --> 43:28.599
<font color="yellow">We have had no proper physical</font>
<font color="yellow">affection.</font>

43:28.600 --> 43:34.719
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to push for her to like</font>
<font color="yellow">me but you cannot force it.</font>

43:34.720 --> 43:40.119
<font color="yellow">Give me a little bit of a chance?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yes, OK.</font>

43:40.120 --> 43:47.759
<font color="yellow">Give me a kiss on the cheek. I am</font>
<font color="yellow">joking. Do not be upset.</font>

43:47.760 --> 43:57.119
<font color="cyan">With Jack, we will give it another</font>
<font color="cyan">go.</font>

43:57.120 --> 44:00.039
<font color="cyan">He does deserve another chance.</font>

44:00.040 --> 44:03.439
<font color="cyan">I would rather give him another go.</font>

44:03.440 --> 44:07.519
<font color="cyan">He's the only boy I have connected</font>
<font color="cyan">with.</font>

44:07.520 --> 44:15.239
<font color="cyan">And it stopped being in a PG world.</font>
<font color="yellow">Do not go to 18!</font>

44:15.240 --> 44:22.039
<font color="yellow">When you have a cry and a cuddle,</font>

44:22.040 --> 44:28.039
<font color="yellow">you've gone past having banter.</font>

44:28.040 --> 44:32.680
<font color="yellow">You're talking deeply</font>
<font color="yellow">and it's real, then.</font>

44:40.440 --> 44:42.440
There's romance.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.799
And some big news in the villa.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.119
Islanders, there will be re-coupling
tonight.

44:52.120 --> 44:54.159
<font color="yellow">The boys will choose</font>

44:54.160 --> 44:58.639
<font color="yellow">and the girl left will be dumped</font>
<font color="yellow">from the island.</font>
